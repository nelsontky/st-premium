    <p>Dr Cham Tao Soon, the found­ing pres­i­dent of Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity (NTU), has a pre­dic­tion: One day, ev­ery­one will need to at­tend polytech­nic be­fore en­ter­ing univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“Computers are get­ting more and more in­tel­li­gent and it is dif­fi­cult for us to suc­ceed in be­ing bet­ter than them,” says Dr Cham, 81, who was also the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) dean of en­gi­neer­ing.</p>
    <p>“What is re­ally needed are skills. I don’t just mean man­ual skills, but the skill of be­ing able to solve prob­lems.”</p>
    <p>Polytech­nics, he be­lieves, are the best places to ac­quire these skills.</p>
    <p>Such ideas loom large in Dr Cham’s au­to­bi­og­ra­phy Life At</p>
    <p>Speed, which is now in book­stores and li­braries.</p>
    <p>It of­fers a dizzy­ing ac­count of his time on the boards of some of Sin­ga­pore’s most well-known or­gan­i­sa­tions – from UOB and Kep­pel Corporatio­n to Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings and SMRT.</p>
    <p>In it, he also de­scribes his en­coun­ters with for­mer prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew, whom he reg­u­larly met for lunch; and his re­la­tion­ship with other prom­i­nent fig­ures, like UOB chair­man emeritus Wee Cho Yaw.</p>
    <p>Dr Cham also helped start UniSIM (now the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sci­ences) and Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Of the many mile­stones in his ca­reer, he is most proud of the 22 years he spent build­ing up NTU, which be­gan in 1981 as the Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal In­sti­tute (NTI). In the early days, it mar­keted its en­gi­neer­ing de­gree as a prac­tice-ori­ented one, which was taught by lec­tur­ers with in­dus­try ex­pe­ri­ence, in con­trast to NUS, which had a more aca­demic fo­cus.</p>
    <p>He is glad NTU is now one of the best univer­si­ties in the world.</p>
    <p>NTU, now helmed by Amer­i­can sci­en­tist Subra Suresh, was re­cently listed as the 47th best univer­sity in the world in the Times Higher Ed­u­ca­tion rank­ings.</p>
    <p>“But what I la­ment is that they con­cen­trate too much on re­search. Af­ter all, univer­si­ties were cre­ated to teach stu­dents, but we spend so much on re­search. I think we pay too much at­ten­tion to rank­ings.”</p>
    <p>Not­ing that only a frac­tion of grad­u­ates en­ter top com­pa­nies and the civil ser­vice, Dr Cham says: “I don’t think we pre­pare well the many stu­dents who have to go into SMEs (small and medium-sized en­ter­prises). Work­ing for an SME is very dif­fer­ent. A grad­u­ate has to do ev­ery­thing – fi­nan­cial work, the law, pub­lic re­la­tions, hu­man re­sources.”</p>
    <p>The photo on the cover of his mem­oir was taken when Dr Cham was a 27-year-old PhD stu­dent at the Univer­sity of Cam­bridge, while he was work­ing on a model of a high-speed plane in a wind tun­nel.</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, the tempo of his life has slowed down. Still, he has no plans to re­tire and re­mains on the boards of about 10 or­gan­i­sa­tions, such as UOB (China), Soup Restau­rant and The Head Foun­da­tion, a think-tank.</p>
    <p>Dr Cham was born in Sin­ga­pore in 1939. He at­tended Raf­fles In­sti­tu­tion and then en­rolled in the Univer­sity of Malaya, grad­u­at­ing in 1964 with a de­gree in civil en­gi­neer­ing. He ob­tained his PhD in aero­dy­nam­ics at Cam­bridge in 1968.</p>
    <p>As a self-taught pi­anist and the honorary chair­man of the Sin­ga­pore Sym­phony Orches­tra Coun­cil, he is also a lover of the arts. He col­lects paint­ings by sec­ond-gen­er­a­tion Sin­ga­pore artists Ang Ah Tee, Thomas Yeo and Ong Kim Seng, and has amassed about 2,000 clas­si­cal mu­sic CDs and DVDs (in­clud­ing 100 ver­sions of Rach­mani­noff’s Piano Con­certo No. 3). A love for mu­sic was what brought him and his wife to­gether – they met in the cheap seats of con­certs at the Vic­to­ria Memo­rial Hall.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple live in a bun­ga­low in Bukit Timah, which they bought for $1.1 mil­lion dur­ing the 1985 re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>In his younger and more ide­al­is­tic days, Dr Cham wanted to be a mu­si­cian. But his par­ents were against it, so he set­tled on en­gi­neer­ing as he was good at maths.</p>
    <p>He has not looked back.</p>
    <p>“Many par­ents ask me to ad­vise their chil­dren – most of them don’t know what they want to do.</p>
    <p>“If your child has no pref­er­ence, my ad­vice is to do en­gi­neer­ing. It’s the most flex­i­ble. Peo­ple in all walks of life are en­gi­neers by train­ing and many of them do not work as en­gi­neers. En­gi­neer­ing teaches you how to solve prob­lems. And life is noth­ing but solv­ing prob­lems.”</p>
    <p>He lets on that the de­fence min­istry was keen to re­cruit him af­ter he re­turned from Cam­bridge. He had a meet­ing with now-re­tired Bri­gadier-Gen­eral Kirpa Ram Vij, who wanted him to help set up the De­fence Science Or­gan­i­sa­tion, dan­gling the prom­ise of a fast pro­mo­tion and polo club membership. Dr Cham was not per­suaded as he had al­ready set his sights on the Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In 1980, Dr Tony Tan, who was then the vice-chan­cel­lor of NUS, asked Dr Cham if he could run the new NTI – the pre­cur­sor of NTU – which was to be erected on the old site of Nanyang Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“This was not only an aca­demic project, it was also a po­lit­i­cal project,” he says. Many mem­bers of the Chi­nese com­mu­nity had been up­set about the merger of Nanyang Univer­sity – the first Chi­nese univer­sity out­side of China – with the Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore to form NUS.</p>
    <p>He ben­e­fited from the sup­port of his wife Teo Ee Lin, 79, who quit her job as a suc­cess­ful geo­physi­cist to raise their two chil­dren. Their</p>
    <p>PRE­PAR­ING STU­DENTS FOR SMES</p>
    <p>son Tat Jen, 51, is now an as­so­ci­ate pro­fes­sor at NTU’s school of com­puter science and en­gi­neer­ing. Their daugh­ter Gee Len, 44, is a free­lance artist. Dr Cham has two grand­chil­dren.</p>
    <p>In the early days, he saw NTI as a start-up and some­times took de­ci­sions into his own hands, with­out es­ca­lat­ing them to the higher au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“With­out that, we would not have de­vel­oped so fast. For that I have to thank Tony Tan for his ad­vice.”</p>
    <p>These days, univer­si­ties “toe the pol­icy line too much”, Dr Cham says. He feels they are be­com­ing too sim­i­lar and caught up in “achiev­ing ex­cel­lence through rank­ings”.</p>
    <p>“It all be­comes iden­ti­cal – the same way of eval­u­at­ing staff, the same way of pro­mot­ing staff.”</p>
    <p>This year, the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment de­liv­ered on the 40 per cent co­hort par­tic­i­pa­tion rate for univer­sity that it had pledged in 2012. That means four out of 10 in an age group will study for a de­gree in one of the six lo­cal univer­si­ties.</p>
    <p>Does Sin­ga­pore have too many univer­sity grad­u­ates?</p>
    <p>Dr Cham says he does not think this is an is­sue if stu­dents are trained well and “know how to evolve based on the eco­nomic re­quire­ments”.</p>
    <p>He later cites an anec­dote from one of his lunchtime con­ver­sa­tions with the late Mr Lee, who be­lieved univer­si­ties should teach stu­dents well no mat­ter their course of study.</p>
    <p>“I said, ideally, we would have cour­ses that cater to the eco­nomic re­quire­ments. But there’s so much de­mand (for spa­ces), be­cause ev­ery par­ent wants his child to have a de­gree,” Dr Cham re­calls.</p>
    <p>“He said, you should make sure they are very well taught. If they are very well taught, they can rise to the eco­nomic re­quire­ments. If you look at the United States, many of the CEOs were not trained in the hard sci­ences. He then said the univer­sity re­sponds to so­cial needs, not eco­nomic needs.”</p>
    <p>Asked what his plans for the fu­ture are, Dr Cham shares his res­o­lu­tions for the new year.</p>
    <p>“One is to learn more about AI (ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence) and In­dus­try 4.0 – to pre­pare my­self for the fu­ture,” he says, adding that he is ex­cited about the way AI might be ap­plied to lo­gis­tics, in­vest­ment and med­i­cal tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>He also wants to ex­er­cise more – he will get back on the tread­mill af­ter he re­cov­ers from a twisted hip mus­cle. The other res­o­lu­tions are to stay en­gaged in so­ci­ety and find more time to savour the arts.</p>
    <p>Would he have done any­thing dif­fer­ently in life?</p>
    <p>No, and he has no re­grets, Dr Cham says, with the con­tented smile of some­one who has made the most of his time.</p>
    <p>“It’s not for you to change your des­tiny. I have been very lucky.”</p>
    <p>I don’t think we pre­pare well the many stu­dents who have to go into SMEs (small and medium-sized en­ter­prises). Work­ing for an SME is very dif­fer­ent. A grad­u­ate has to do ev­ery­thing – fi­nan­cial work, the law, pub­lic re­la­tions, hu­man re­sources.</p>
    <p>WHY CHOOSE EN­GI­NEER­ING</p>
    <p>Many par­ents ask me to ad­vise their chil­dren – most of them don’t know what they want to do.</p>
    <p>If your child has no pref­er­ence, my ad­vice is to do en­gi­neer­ing. It’s the most flex­i­ble. Peo­ple in all walks of life are en­gi­neers by train­ing and many of them do not work as en­gi­neers. En­gi­neer­ing teaches you how to solve prob­lems. And life is noth­ing but solv­ing prob­lems.</p>
