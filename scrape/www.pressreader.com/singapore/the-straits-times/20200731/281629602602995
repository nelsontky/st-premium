    <p>The top and im­me­di­ate pri­or­ity of the Min­istry of Trans­port (MOT) is to re­vive air travel and main­tain Sin­ga­pore’s hub sta­tus, said its new min­is­ter, Mr Ong Ye Kung, yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This re­quires a multi-min­istry ef­fort, as it in­volves ne­go­ti­at­ing re­cip­ro­cal green lane ar­range­ments with coun­tries that have re­duced their Covid-19 trans­mis­sion rates, he told re­porters at a cer­e­mony to mark the re­sump­tion of work on the Jo­hor Baru-Sin­ga­pore rail link.</p>
    <p>In such agree­ments, safe­guards like pre-de­par­ture swab tests are used in lieu of lengthy quar­an­tines.</p>
    <p>Such a move will help breathe life into an air travel mar­ket “dec­i­mated” by the coro­n­avirus, he added. And it is a cru­cial en­deav­our be­cause Sin­ga­pore’s two hubs, its sea­port and Changi Air­port, are akin to “vi­tal or­gans to the Sin­ga­pore eco­nomic body”.</p>
    <p>Like a body’s two lungs, they “oxy­genate and vi­talise var­i­ous parts of the body and... add vi­tal­ity and com­pet­i­tive­ness to all sec­tors of Sin­ga­pore”, he said.</p>
    <p>This is why the coun­try’s hub sta­tus is in­ex­tri­ca­bly tied to jobs and its eco­nomic com­pet­i­tive­ness, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong fur­ther pointed out that in­vestors have two key con­sid­er­a­tions on whether to set up shop in Sin­ga­pore. One is whether their prod­ucts and com­po­nents can move through Sin­ga­pore eas­ily, and the other is the ease with which em­ploy­ees and clients can meet in Sin­ga­pore or travel from here.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore as a hub en­ables us to do that, and that is why Sin­ga­pore re­mains com­pet­i­tive,” said Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>He was the Min­is­ter for Ed­u­ca­tion be­fore last week’s Cab­i­net reshuf­fle.</p>
    <p>In an­nounc­ing his new Cab­i­net, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong had said the MOT’s em­pha­sis in the next few years will shift from im­prov­ing pub­lic trans­port re­li­a­bil­ity to en­vi­sion­ing and re­al­is­ing Sin­ga­pore’s post-Covid-19 con­nec­tiv­ity by land, sea and air.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said he had picked Mr Ong to helm the min­istry, given his “Cab­i­net ex­pe­ri­ence and po­lit­i­cal nous”, as part of the job re­quires en­gage­ment with Malaysia and In­done­sia on ma­jor bi­lat­eral projects such as the High-Speed Rail and the Rapid Tran­sit Sys­tem Link be­tween Jo­hor Baru and Wood­lands, as well as sen­si­tive airspace and mar­itime is­sues.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Ong noted that while the pan­demic has af­fected both sea and air­port op­er­a­tions, the im­pact on the sea port has not been too dras­tic and he ex­pects PSA Corp to “still do quite well” this year.</p>
    <p>But the im­pact on the avi­a­tion sec­tor has been far greater.</p>
    <p>It is in the busi­ness of mov­ing peo­ple and has con­se­quently been hit hard by the virus.</p>
    <p>“So in the com­ing weeks, com­ing months, the top pri­or­ity is what steps can we take to re­vive our avi­a­tion hub,” he said, not­ing that his min­istry, the Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs and var­i­ous min­istries are work­ing to­gether to ne­go­ti­ate re­cip­ro­cal green lanes.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has made such agree­ments with China and Malaysia so far, which al­low trav­ellers on es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial pur­poses to re­place the cus­tom­ary 14-day self­quar­an­tine with mea­sures such as pre-de­par­ture swab tests and the sub­mis­sion of de­tailed itin­er­ar­ies.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing for­ward, let’s hope (we) can ne­go­ti­ate more re­cip­ro­cal green lanes,” said Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>He stressed that it is cru­cial not to take Sin­ga­pore’s sta­tus as an avi­a­tion hub for granted, as other coun­tries will be vy­ing for the same busi­ness when the world­wide Covid-19 pan­demic starts show­ing signs of be­ing brought un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>When that hap­pens, Sin­ga­pore once again “needs to be able to fight back, se­cure and re­vive its avi­a­tion sec­tor while be­ing able to keep (the) trans­mis­sion level low and main­tain­ing the health of Sin­ga­pore­ans”, he said.</p>
    <p>“This is a key is­sue that we will have to grap­ple with in the com­ing weeks and months.”</p>
    <p>ABLE TO FIGHT BACK</p>
    <p>(Sin­ga­pore) needs to be able to fight back, se­cure and re­vive its avi­a­tion sec­tor while be­ing able to keep (the) trans­mis­sion level low and main­tain­ing the health of Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
