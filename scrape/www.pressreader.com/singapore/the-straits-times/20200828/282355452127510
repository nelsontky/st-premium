    <p>LON­DON • Manch­ester United goal­keeper Dean Hen­der­son sig­nalled his in­tent to chal­lenge David de Gea for the No. 1 spot and “play as many games as pos­si­ble” af­ter sign­ing a deal ex­ten­sion which will keep him at Old Traf­ford un­til 2025.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old spent two sea­sons on loan at Sh­effield United, help­ing them earn pro­mo­tion from the sec­ond-tier Cham­pi­onship in the 2019 cam­paign be­fore keep­ing 13 clean sheets in the Premier League last sea­son as the Blades fin­ished ninth.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial de­tails of the con­tract, which has an op­tion to ex­tend for a fur­ther year, were not dis­closed, but Bri­tish me­dia re­ported Hen­der­son will earn about £120,000 (S$216,400) a week at United, mak­ing him one of the best-paid goal­keep­ers. “I will be giv­ing ev­ery­thing to im­prove every day so I can play as many games as pos­si­ble for this great club,” Hen­der­son said.</p>
    <p>“The path­way that I have been on for the past five years has been fan­tas­tic for my devel­op­ment and the in­valu­able loan pe­riod at Sh­effield United has been part of that.”</p>
    <p>His re­turn to the club is likely to see de Gea’s long-term back-up,</p>
    <p>Ser­gio Romero, move on.</p>
    <p>United man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer has as­sured Hen­der­son that he will have a shot as a starter af­ter the stop­per told the Nor­we­gian that he does not want to be on the Old Traf­ford bench.</p>
    <p>Spain in­ter­na­tional de Gea, United’s No. 1 since j oin­ing for £18 mil­lion from Atletico Madrid in 2011, came un­der scru­tiny last sea­son fol­low­ing a num­ber of high­pro­file er­rors.</p>
    <p>“Dean is a fan­tas­tic young ’keeper with the at­ti­tude and work rate to keep im­prov­ing every day,” Sol­sk­jaer said. “We are in a strong po­si­tion within the goal­keep­ing depart­ment and that gives us the com­pe­ti­tion for places.”</p>
    <p>United fin­ished third in the Premier League last sea­son to se­cure Cham­pi­ons League qual­i­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Hen­der­son will shift his at­ten­tion to Eng­land af­ter be­ing called up by man­ager Gareth South­gate for next month’s Na­tions League matches against Ice­land and Den­mark. United team­mate Paul Pogba has been dropped from Di­dier Deschamps’ France squad for games against Swe­den and Croa­tia fol­low­ing a pos­i­tive coro­n­avirus test.</p>
