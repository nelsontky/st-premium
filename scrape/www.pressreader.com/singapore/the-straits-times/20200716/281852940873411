    <p>JAKARTA • In­done­sia re­ported 87 new coro­n­avirus deaths yes­ter­day, its big­gest daily jump so far, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of fa­tal­i­ties to 3,797, its Health Min­istry said.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia also re­ported 1,522 new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, tak­ing the over­all tally to 80,094 cases, min­istry of­fi­cial Ach­mad Yurianto told a tele­vised news brief­ing.</p>
    <p>The cap­i­tal city Jakarta recorded 260 new con­firmed cases, bring­ing the to­tal tally there to 15,324.</p>
    <p>Within the past 24 hours, seven prov­inces, namely North Su­ma­tra, South Kal­i­man­tan, Jakarta, West Java, Cen­tral Java, East Java and South Su­lawesi, recorded high num­bers of cases, Mr Yurianto said.</p>
    <p>He called on the pub­lic to obey the im­ple­mented health pro­to­cols in a bid to avoid more Covid-19 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Philip­pine Health Sec­re­tary Fran­cisco Duque clar­i­fied that the coun­try had been able to slow down the spread of the coro­n­avirus un­til lock­down mea­sures were lifted. He had ear­lier said that the Philip­pines had al­ready flat­tened the in­fec­tion curve.</p>
    <p>“We flat­tened the curve for some time un­til we started open­ing up,” Dr Duque said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A lock­down over large parts of the coun­try has served its pur­pose as it now takes eight days for Covid-19 cases to dou­ble, he said. It took only three days in April.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to see in­creases in cases, but what we need to make sure of is that they don’t trans­late to deaths,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines re­ported 1,392 new in­fec­tions yes­ter­day, tak­ing the tally to 58,850, the sec­ond-high­est in the re­gion and a nearly 600 per cent jump from the 8,488 cases in end-April, ac­cord­ing to data.</p>
    <p>In that same pe­riod, the num­ber of deaths also nearly tripled from 568 to 1,614.</p>
    <p>In May, Dr Duque said the coun­try was al­ready ex­pe­ri­enc­ing its sec­ond wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, prompt­ing a cor­rec­tion from the Depart­ment of Health.</p>
    <p>Philip­pine Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte was due to de­cide yes­ter­day whether to main­tain par­tial re­stric­tions in the cap­i­tal Manila to slow the spread of the virus as some hos­pi­tals reach crit­i­cal care ca­pac­ity.</p>
