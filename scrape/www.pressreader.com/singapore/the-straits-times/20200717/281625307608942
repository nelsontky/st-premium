    <p>Re­sorts World Sen­tosa’s (RWS) casino was among the new places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were still in­fec­tious, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Three vis­its were recorded at the casino, on July 4, 5 and 6, but MOH did not say whether dif­fer­ent pa­tients made the vis­its sep­a­rately or at least one pa­tient vis­ited the lo­ca­tion thrice.</p>
    <p>The Traf­fic Po­lice head­quar­ters in Ubi, Master Prata i n Sem­bawang Shop­ping Cen­tre and a Gi­ant Ex­press out­let in Bukit Ba­tok East were also among the places newly added to a list of lo­ca­tions vis­ited by in­fec­tious pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides a list of lo­ca­tions and times that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients have vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes, to get those who were at these places dur­ing those spe­cific pe­ri­ods to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on MOH’s web­site. The min­istry has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned if needed.</p>
    <p>MOH also said the av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from 16 cases two weeks ago to 12 in the past week. It is the third day in a row the fig­ure has dropped.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked com­mu­nity cases in a week fell from a daily av­er­age of eight cases to seven over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>MOH an­nounced 248 new Covid-19 cases yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing 11 in the com­mu­nity – two Sin­ga­pore­ans, five work pass hold­ers, two work per­mit hold­ers and two de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Five of the com­mu­nity cases were linked to pre­vi­ous cases or clus­ters. They were all asymp­to­matic and were de­tected dur­ing proac­tive screen­ing.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing six com­mu­nity cases were un­linked as of yes­ter­day. Of these, five cases were asymp­to­matic, and were de­tected as a re­sult of screen­ing of work­ers in es­sen­tial ser­vices who are liv­ing out­side dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions are be­ing done for the re­main­ing pa­tient, who was swabbed un­der en­hanced com­mu­nity test­ing to test all in­di­vid­u­als aged 13 and above who are di­ag­nosed with acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion when they first visit a doc­tor.</p>
    <p>Four im­ported cases were an­nounced yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing a Sin­ga­porean and a per­ma­nent res­i­dent who re­turned from Azer­bai­jan on July 4, and a Sin­ga­porean who re­turned from the United States on July 3.</p>
    <p>The last im­ported case is a work pass holder. She ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore from In­done­sia on July 4.</p>
    <p>All the im­ported cases were placed on 14-day stay-home no­tices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, and had been tested while serv­ing their no­tices, said MOH.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 233 cases, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 47,126.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 14 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
