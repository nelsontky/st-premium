    <p>LESS PRES­SURE</p>
    <p>The in­dica­tive sec­ondary school en­try scores an­nounced by the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) were wel­comed by par­ents with pri­mary school chil­dren, who said they are help­ful to plan for and short­list schools that their chil­dren can re­al­is­ti­cally qual­ify for.</p>
    <p>The range of scores, for pupils tak­ing the Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion un­der the new Achieve­ment Level (AL) scor­ing sys­tem next year were re­leased yes­ter­day. They are based on last year’s Pri­mary 6 data.</p>
    <p>Schools fall broadly into three cat­e­gories: gov­ern­ment and gov­ern­ment-aided, au­tonomous and in­de­pen­dent.</p>
    <p>For au­tonomous schools, the in­dica­tive cut-off point for the Ex­press (In­te­grated Pro­gramme) course is seven to nine, while for in­de­pen­dent schools, the range is six to eight.</p>
    <p>The best pos­si­ble score un­der the AL sys­tem would be four, mean­ing a child at­tains the best AL1 in all four sub­jects.</p>
    <p>But MOE’s di­rec­tor-gen­eral of ed­u­ca­tion Wong Siew Hoong said yes­ter­day that the in­dica­tive cut-off points show that a per­fect AL score of four may not be needed to get into some of the pop­u­lar schools.</p>
    <p>Ad­min­is­tra­tor Siti Ha­zlina, 46, who has a son in Pri­mary 5 – the first batch of stu­dents to go through the new scor­ing sys­tem – said the in­dica­tive scores are re­as­sur­ing.</p>
    <p>She is think­ing of en­rolling him in Raf­fles In­sti­tu­tion or the NUS High School of Math­e­mat­ics and Sci­ence.</p>
    <p>Her son is good at English, maths and sci­ence, but is weak in his mother-tongue lan­guage, Tamil.</p>
    <p>“When the AL sys­tem was an­nounced, we thought that he would be dis­ad­van­taged be­cause even if he gets 98 or 100 for his strong sub­jects, those ad­di­tional marks would not count for any­thing, un­like with the T-score sys­tem, where it could pull up his ag­gre­gate,” said Madam Ha­zlina.</p>
    <p>“But now, you need a cut-off point of only six to nine to go to an IP school, which means there is still room for the child to be ‘weak’ in one sub­ject and learn at his own pace.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Tina Tan, 45, who also has a son in Pri­mary 5, said the in­dica­tive score is use­ful in help­ing par­ents work with their chil­dren to im­prove, with­out ex­tra pres­sure.</p>
    <p>The free­lance par­ent trainer added: “Pupils who used to be forced to get per­fect scores ev­ery time, and get harshly pe­nalised for get­ting one or two marks fewer than ex­pected, would be able to breathe bet­ter and feel less stressed.”</p>
    <p>But some par­ents like house­wife Joanna Tan said there does not seem to be a change in how schools are per­ceived.</p>
    <p>“The only change here is the scor­ing sys­tem. In fact, the ‘bet­ter’ schools might end up with more stu­dents try­ing to ap­ply for them.</p>
    <p>“Pre­vi­ously, ev­ery sin­gle mark counts. Now, it is dif­fer­ent and it doesn’t mat­ter if you score 100 or 91 any­more,” said the 40-year-old, who has a daugh­ter in Pri­mary 1 and a son in Pri­mary 5.</p>
    <p>She added: “If more chil­dren have the same score, there will likely be more bal­lot­ing.</p>
    <p>“That would be stress­ful for both par­ents and chil­dren.”</p>
    <p>Pupils who used to be forced to get per­fect scores ev­ery time, and get harshly pe­nalised for get­ting one or two marks fewer than ex­pected, would be able to breathe bet­ter and feel less stressed.</p>
