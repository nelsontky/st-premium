    <p>Con­sumers have ex­pressed con­cerns that the scheme to give Sin­ga­pore­ans $100 worth of tourism vouch­ers to spend on the island may be too in­con­ve­nient for some to use.</p>
    <p>From next month, those aged 18 and above will re­ceive on­line vouch­ers to spend on lo­cal at­trac­tions, ho­tel stays and tours.</p>
    <p>While many have wel­comed the move, con­sumers who spoke to The Straits Times have also ex­pressed wor­ries af­ter more de­tails were an­nounced by the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A chief con­cern was the “ex­tremely com­pli­cated redemp­tion process”, with some like small busi­ness owner Lim Sioe Hwan, 32, say­ing that the in­con­ve­nience would de­ter people from spend­ing the vouch­ers – es­pe­cially the elderly.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim said: “It would make much more sense for there to be just one STB-run web­site, rather than put more pres­sure on the cus­tomer to jump through hoops just to re­deem a voucher... In­stead of be­ing spoilt for choice, it makes things more con­fus­ing.”</p>
    <p>He added that his par­ents, both in their late 60s, were be­fud­dled by the redemp­tion process.</p>
    <p>Univer­sity stu­dent Lynn Koh, 22, also sug­gested that there be a “cen­tralised search engine”, where all the deals avail­able could be show­cased with the rel­e­vant links.</p>
    <p>“With­out a cen­tral point for con­ve­nient com­par­i­son and con­trast, it is even harder for cus­tomers to make dis­cern­ing choices. If a lot of home­work is in­volved just to use a voucher, it takes the ease out of what could be a fairly sim­ple process,” she said.</p>
    <p>En­gi­neer Raju Govin­dasamy, 49, in­tends to use the vouch­ers for a fam­ily out­ing at a lo­cal at­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>“It is a good idea, but the way it is be­ing im­ple­mented seems odd,” he said.</p>
    <p>“When you i nvolve mul­ti­ple mer­chants and do not have a cen­tralised site from which vouch­ers can be re­deemed, you make it much more dif­fi­cult for con­sumers, how­ever will­ing they are, to go about the process.”</p>
    <p>Some cus­tomers also ex­pressed wor­ries that older and less IT-savvy Sin­ga­pore­ans would find it dif­fi­cult to re­deem the vouch­ers – par­tic­u­larly with there be­ing spe­cialised phys­i­cal redemp­tion coun­ters run by each mer­chant.</p>
    <p>“It is con­fus­ing when there are spe­cific coun­ters meant for spe­cific deals only,” said Mr Loke Kam Wing, 77, who wants to use his vouch­ers for a day out with his wife, who is also in her 70s.</p>
    <p>“I will not only have to do re­search on­line about what deals to get in ad­vance, but I will also have to find the cor­re­spond­ing counter, which might not be close to me at all.”</p>
    <p>For Mr Goh Min Kwang, 45, who works in bank­ing, the pri­mary con­cern is the pos­si­bil­ity that un­scrupu­lous mer­chants might jack up the price of pack­ages or ac­tiv­i­ties, negat­ing the value of the $100 voucher. “I hope there can be more trans­parency and in­tense price reg­u­la­tion,” Mr Goh said.</p>
    <p>STB said it takes a se­ri­ous view of prac­tices such as prof­i­teer­ing and will pe­nalise mer­chants found to have done so.</p>
    <p>But many people ST spoke to were very happy with the prospect of tourism vouch­ers – which can be used at all ap­proved ho­tels, leisure at­trac­tions and lo­cal tours.</p>
    <p>Ms Sak­i­nah Mohd, 44, is con­sid­er­ing spend­ing the vouch­ers on a fam­ily stay­ca­tion on Sen­tosa to cel­e­brate her daugh­ter Maia’s eighth birth­day, which is on Dec 20.</p>
    <p>“This ini­tia­tive helps to raise aware­ness of the dif­fer­ent at­trac­tions we can visit,” she said.</p>
    <p>The vouch­ers can­not be trans­ferred be­tween in­di­vid­u­als or com­bined with other people’s vouch­ers. But Ms Sak­i­nah added that she does not mind be­cause they “al­low those whose liveli­hoods and in­comes have been hit by Covid-19 to en­joy time with fam­ily”.</p>
