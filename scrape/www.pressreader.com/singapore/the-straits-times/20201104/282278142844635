    <p>RE­DUC­ING THE RISKS</p>
    <p>You have got to make sure you dis­able (the third rail), be­cause it is no joke walk­ing next to 750 volts... and that night, there was in­clement weather and then there’s light­ning risk.</p>
    <p>TRANS­PORT MIN­IS­TER ONG YE KUNG, ex­plain­ing that de­train­ment is car­ried out only as a “last re­sort”, due to the risks in­volved.</p>
    <p>Rail op­er­a­tor SMRT made the cor­rect calls in han­dling the evac­u­a­tion of pas­sen­gers stranded on stalled trains dur­ing the mas­sive MRT dis­rup­tion on Oct 14, said Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung.</p>
    <p>He told the House yes­ter­day that rail guide­lines call for a de­ci­sion to be made within 30 min­utes on whether to evac­u­ate pas­sen­gers from trains and walk on the tracks to the near­est sta­tion – a process termed de­train­ment.</p>
    <p>SMRT de­cided to evac­u­ate pas­sen­gers 40 min­utes after the break­down be­gan that evening as it ini­tially held “some hope” that it could draw power from another sub­sta­tion to re­vive the net­work, he said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the at­tempt to re­in­state power to the dis­rupted sec­tions of the North-South and EastWest lines failed. It also shut down train ser­vices along part of the Cir­cle Line.</p>
    <p>About 6,800 com­muters were caught in stalled trains across the three MRT lines on Oct 14. Of that to­tal, 78 re­mained stranded on one train for nearly three hours, owing to bad weather. The long time taken to evac­u­ate them had drawn crit­i­cism from the public.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said de­train­ment is car­ried out only as a “last re­sort”, due to the risks in­volved – for in­stance, peo­ple trip­ping on the tracks or walk­ing next to the third rail which has high elec­tric­ity cur­rents pass­ing through it when trains are run­ning.</p>
    <p>“You have got to make sure you dis­able (the third rail), be­cause it is no joke walk­ing next to 750 volts... and that night, there was in­clement weather and then there’s light­ning risk.”</p>
    <p>SMRT stopped the de­train­ment once there was light­ning risk, Mr Ong said in re­sponse to Mr Sak­tiandi Su­paat (Bis­han-Toa Payoh GRC). “Never put pas­sen­gers’ lives in dan­ger,” he said. “I think the de­ci­sions they made that night in terms of de­train­ment were cor­rect.”</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter had re­capped the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity’s (LTA) find­ings on how the concurrent fail­ures of a power ca­ble and trip coil in a cir­cuit breaker along the Tuas West Ex­ten­sion had caused the break­down, which af­fected 123,000 com­muters.</p>
    <p>On whether SMRT would be pe­nalised for the break­down, Mr Ong said in re­sponse to Mr Sak­tiandi that sys­tems sup­plier Al­stom has al­ready com­mit­ted to re­plac­ing faulty equip­ment that con­trib­uted to the break­down.</p>
    <p>SMRT and LTA have also re­flected on what they could have done bet­ter, he said, adding that it was more im­por­tant to work to­gether to im­prove the rail net­work rather than point fin­gers.</p>
    <p>“The mood can eas­ily change when it be­comes one of penalty and pun­ish­ment,” he said. “And then the mood changes when ev­ery­one... to put it crudely, cov­ers their be­hinds, and after a while you don’t get the best out­come.”</p>
    <p>But there is a dis­ci­plinary struc­ture in place, he said, and the au­thor­i­ties will pe­nalise op­er­a­tors if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said Al­stom will re­place all elec­tri­cal power ca­bles span­ning 150km along the Tuas West Ex­ten­sion by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>It will also re­place all 113 trip coils – core com­po­nents of cir­cuit break­ers – along the three-yearold western stretch of the EastWest Line by the end of this year.</p>
    <p>The com­pany will do so at its own cost, which it did not di­vulge.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said: “No­body wishes for an in­ci­dent like this to hap­pen, but when it does, we should not let it break our spirit.</p>
    <p>“So as a team, we take col­lec­tive re­spon­si­bil­ity, not fin­ger-point, and we will do our best and close the gaps.”</p>
