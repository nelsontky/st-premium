    <p>Doc­tor-busi­ness­man Goh Jin Hian could face le­gal ac­tion for breaches of his direc­tor’s du­ties at a firm that has lost its op­er­at­ing li­cence and has been placed un­der ju­di­cial man­age­ment amid fi­nan­cial stress.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that Dr Goh, who is the son of for­mer prime min­is­ter Goh Chok Tong, has not been ac­cused of fraud­u­lent con­duct.</p>
    <p>The al­le­ga­tions are more akin to neg­li­gence when car­ry­ing out his du­ties as a direc­tor at marine fu­els sup­plier In­ter-Pa­cific Petroleum (IPP).</p>
    <p>Dr Goh, 52, who was a direc­tor at the firm from June 28, 2011 to Aug 20 last year, told The Straits Times on Thurs­day that the al­le­ga­tions against him were “with­out merit”.</p>
    <p>“My lawyers have ex­changed cor­re­spon­dence with them, and de­tailed why there is no jus­ti­fi­able case against me.”</p>
    <p>He is rep­re­sented by Se­nior Coun­sel Thio Shen Yi, joint manag­ing part­ner of TSMP Law.</p>
    <p>ST un­der­stands that two of IPP’s largest cred­i­tors – Malayan Bank­ing and So­ci­ete Gen­erale’s Sin­ga­pore branch – are owed more than $169 mil­lion in to­tal and are pre­pared to fund pos­si­ble le­gal ac­tion against Dr Goh.</p>
    <p>IPP, which faces pos­si­ble liq­ui­da­tion, is one of a string of Sin­ga­pore-based com­mod­ity trad­ing firms that have found them­selves in trou­bled wa­ters since the pan­demic be­gan and oil prices plunged.</p>
    <p>Oil trad­ing gi­ant Hin Leong filed for bank­ruptcy pro­tec­tion i n April, while ju­di­cial man­agers have filed ap­pli­ca­tions to have ZenRock Com­modi­ties Trad­ing and palm oil and coal trad­ing firm Agri­trade In­ter­na­tional liq­ui­dated.</p>
    <p>The lo­cal arm of Chi­nese in­de­pen­dent oil trader Hon­top has also been placed un­der ju­di­cial man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>IPP and its par­ent com­pany In­ter-Pa­cific Group (IPG) filed for a court-led debt re­struc­tur­ing process in Au­gust last year.</p>
    <p>They cited “a sig­nif­i­cant cash­flow crunch” fol­low­ing the suspension of IPP’s li­cence by the Mar­itime and Port Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore, which de­tected op­er­a­tional ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties dur­ing an in­spec­tion. IPG was wound up in March this year.</p>
    <p>Deloitte & Touche, which was ap­pointed ju­di­cial man­agers of IPG and IPP last year, has been granted a six-month ex­ten­sion of the ju­di­cial man­age­ment or­der for IPP.</p>
    <p>ST un­der­stands that the ex­ten­sion granted by the High Court last week would al­low the ju­di­cial man­agers more time to con­sider tak­ing le­gal ac­tion against Dr Goh.</p>
    <p>The is­sue was first re­ported by bunker pub­li­ca­tion Man­i­fold Times on Sept 16. How­ever, the re­port did not say that the ex­ten­sion of the ju­di­cial man­age­ment or­der had al­ready been granted by the court.</p>
    <p>Dr Goh is listed on the Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal Coun­cil’s reg­is­ter as a med­i­cal prac­ti­tioner at IAG Health­sciences at Paragon Med­i­cal.</p>
    <p>He is also chair­man and in­de­pen­dent direc­tor of Sin­ga­porelisted Cordlife Group and had held sev­eral ex­ec­u­tive se­nior po­si­tions in Park­way Hold­ings – now part of IHH Health­care – be­tween 1999 and 2011, in­clud­ing as chief ex­ec­u­tive of Gle­nea­gles Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Dr Goh took over as chair­man of listed in­vest­ment hold­ing com­pany New Silkroutes Group on Aug 1 and will re­tire as its chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer on Oct 1.</p>
