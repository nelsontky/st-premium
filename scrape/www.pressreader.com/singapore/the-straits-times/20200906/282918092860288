    <p>While dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing may be the cause of some work­ers miss­ing out on job op­por­tu­ni­ties, there are in­stances where the hir­ing de­ci­sion boils down to the mis­match in skills and ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>“Com­pa­nies will al­ways try to bring in the right tal­ent, at the right time, at the right cost, to meet their long-term and short-term needs,” says Ms Low Peck Kem, pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore Hu­man Re­sources In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>The right tal­ent means one with the level of skills, com­pe­ten­cies, at­ti­tudes and at­tributes that can meet the re­quire­ments of the job, she notes.</p>
    <p>Mr Jens Rub­bert, pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­porean-Ger­man Cham­ber of In­dus­try and Com­merce, says: “The ques­tion re­gard­ing the work­force is not about whether they are for­eign­ers or Sin­ga­pore­ans, the ques­tion is about the right qual­i­fi­ca­tions and skills, in­ter­na­tional ex­po­sure and knowl­edge of com­pany cul­ture, tech­ni­cal skills, soft skills.”</p>
    <p>So why are Sin­ga­pore­ans miss­ing out on some job op­por­tu­ni­ties that end up be­ing filled by for­eign­ers?</p>
    <p>It boils down to at­ti­tude and the lack of core life skills, says Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Cham­ber of Com­merce chief ex­ec­u­tive Vic­tor Mills, cit­ing his own ex­pe­ri­ence and feed­back from the cham­ber’s mem­ber com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>“Tech­ni­cal knowl­edge, prod­uct knowl­edge can all be eas­ily ac­quired on the job. What lo­cal and for­eign, large and small com­pa­nies tell me all the time is that the qual­ity of too many Sin­ga­porean job can­di­dates is poor.</p>
    <p>“They have a sub-par at­ti­tude, they can­not com­mu­ni­cate clearly and con­cisely, they do not know how to ask ques­tions, they do not ex­hibit the abil­ity to work in cross­bor­der teams,” he says, not­ing that the lack of these core life skills is hold­ing peo­ple back.</p>
    <p>A sur­vey con­ducted by the Amer­i­can Cham­ber of Com­merce in Sin­ga­pore (AmCham) be­tween Novem­ber 2018 and March last year found that three at­tributes that were most dif­fi­cult to find among lo­cal pro­fes­sion­als, and which re­sulted in hir­ing of for­eign­ers for pro­fes­sional roles, were the will­ing­ness to take risks, cre­ative or crit­i­cal think­ing, and lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>This ap­plied to both multi­na­tional com­pa­nies and small and medium-sized en­ter­prises.</p>
    <p>It is a long­stand­ing prob­lem, and these at­tributes were the top three that com­pa­nies iden­ti­fied as be­ing the most dif­fi­cult to find among lo­cal work­ers, ac­cord­ing to pre­vi­ous sur­veys con­ducted by AmCham in 2015 to 2018.</p>
    <p>Re­cruit­ment firm Achieve Group’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Joshua Yim be­lieves that these at­tribute weak­nesses may be due to the na­ture of Sin­ga­pore’s ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem, which tends to­wards a top-down ap­proach that may sti­fle the de­vel­op­ment of these qual­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“This will level out over time, with our ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem (chang­ing) and ex­po­sure, but it is not im</p>
    <p>me­di­ate,” he says.</p>
    <p>Shar­ing the sen­ti­ments of cham­ber lead­ers that Sin­ga­pore­ans are not lack­ing in tech­ni­cal abil­ity, in ar­eas such as sci­ence, bank­ing and in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy, Mr Jef­frey Seah, part­ner at ven­ture cap­i­tal firm Quest Ven­tures, high­lights that the rea­son for Sin­ga­pore­ans not land­ing these jobs is the mis­match in cul­tural fit and mind­set.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore­ans are not good at be­ing com­fort­able in un­com­fort­able sit­u­a­tions,” says Mr Seah.</p>
    <p>A MAT­TER OF PREF­ER­ENCE</p>
    <p>But the in­abil­ity to fit into the cul­ture of cer­tain firms may be an is­sue that is out of the hands of lo­cal job seek­ers, he sug­gests.</p>
    <p>He cites a hy­po­thet­i­cal ex­am­ple where a small tech com­pany starts with hir­ing three for­eign­ers with skill sets not avail­able among lo­cal job seek­ers in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the com­pany’s growth stage, they will hire non-tech staff in ar­eas like fi­nance and sales, which is also when the com­pany’s cul­ture and mind­set take root.</p>
    <p>“This is also when the balanc­ing of hires (be­tween lo­cals and for­eign­ers) should be ac­tively en­cour­aged,” Mr Seah says.</p>
    <p>If by the time the com­pany has 20 em­ploy­ees, and the su­per-ma­jor­ity are from one eth­nic­ity or a for­eign coun­try, it would be dif­fi­cult for the com­pany to hire oth­ers, like Sin­ga­pore­ans, who need to adapt to the ex­ist­ing work cul­ture. But im­por­tantly, it would also be dif­fi­cult for pol­icy in­ter­ven­tion to en­force a hir­ing ra­tio with­out af­fect­ing the com­pany’s op­er­at­ing cul­ture, he adds.</p>
    <p>In cases of tech start-ups that tend to in­volve a lot of team­work, that cul­tural fit is in­te­gral, Mr Seah em­pha­sises.</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing about the pos­si­ble mis­match in tech­ni­cal skills, Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Wal­ter Th­e­seira, a for­mer Nom­i­nated MP, high­lights the chal­lenges that Sin­ga­pore faces as a city-state.</p>
    <p>It is not that Sin­ga­pore de­lib­er­ately sets out to dis­ad­van­tage lo­cals, he stresses. But for it to thrive and com­pete with other global cities, it has to draw from the larger tal­ent pool.</p>
    <p>Fun­da­men­tally, be­cause of the dis­tri­bu­tion of tal­ent, only a small pro­por­tion of any pop­u­la­tion will have the ca­pa­bil­i­ties to rise to the top in skilled pro­fes­sions.</p>
    <p>Skills train­ing also re­quires a cer­tain level of un­der­ly­ing abil­ity and takes time.</p>
    <p>“We have a small pop­u­la­tion base, so re­ly­ing on that alone is in­ad­e­quate to fill jobs that re­quire both spe­cialised skills and high tal­ent. Just train­ing alone, say, in com­puter sci­ence, can only do so much if your un­der­ly­ing tal­ent pool is small,” he says.</p>
    <p>Ex­pand­ing the num­ber of com­puter sci­ence places, in this case, does not en­sure that all who grad­u­ate will be suited for the job, Prof Th­e­seira adds.</p>
    <p>Skills train­ing and i mprov­ing qual­ity can help to close some gaps in the labour mar­ket, but there are struc­tural dif­fi­cul­ties in re­ly­ing on do­mes­tic skills train­ing to ful­fil all of the coun­try’s labour needs, he says.</p>
