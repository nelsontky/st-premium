    <p>A CHANGI AIR­PORT WORKER, on not be­ing able to make his monthly re­pay­ments to li­censed money­len­ders af­ter hav­ing two pay cuts this year.</p>
    <p>Af­ter his salary was re­duced by more than half in March, John (not his real name) strug­gled to meet his per­sonal ex­penses and sup­port his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old later bor­rowed a to­tal of $10,000 from two li­censed money­len­ders but was un­able to make his monthly re­pay­ments when he had an­other pay cut.</p>
    <p>“I still have my own bills to pay,” said John, who works at Changi Air­port but de­clined to give de­tails about his job.</p>
    <p>He even­tu­ally sought as­sis­tance from so­cial ser­vice agency Adul­lam Life Coun­selling to re­solve his debt is­sues.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of peo­ple seek­ing help over debt trou­bles has in­creased since the start of the Covid-19 cri­sis, said most so­cial ser­vice agen­cies The Straits Times spoke to, though fewer peo­ple ap­pear to be ap­proach­ing money­len­ders and pawn­bro­kers for loans.</p>
    <p>“In the past, we had about 40 cases in a month; now it comes to about an av­er­age of 60,” said Adul­lam Life Coun­selling chair­man Wong Kee Soon.</p>
    <p>He said a ma­jor­ity of the cases were peo­ple who had suf­fered pay cuts or lost their jobs since the</p>
    <p>Covid-19 cri­sis be­gan.</p>
    <p>This loss of in­come also af­fects ex­ist­ing help-seek­ers who were in the midst of clear­ing their debts, said Ms Joanna Kong, gen­eral man­ager of non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion One Hope Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“Sud­denly, the amount that was agreed upon – the re­pay­ment amount – they can­not ser­vice it any more,” she said.</p>
    <p>This is the sit­u­a­tion that a woman, who wanted to be known as Jane, found her­self in this year.</p>
    <p>The 50-year-old was al­ready in debt to a loan shark and five li­censed money­len­ders be­fore her salary was halved in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>She be­came un­able to pay the in­ter­est on her loans, which ac­cu­mu­lated ei­ther weekly or monthly. “I felt stuck,” said Jane.</p>
    <p>She is now re­ceiv­ing help from Adul­lam Life Coun­selling.</p>
    <p>Some so­cial ser­vice agen­cies ex­pect more in­di­vid­u­als to seek as­sis­tance over their debts as the eco­nomic down­turn con­tin­ues.</p>
    <p>“In the com­ing months or even next year, we ex­pect to see more of such cases, be­cause they lose their jobs or their in­come is af­fected due to the Covid-19 pe­riod,” said a spokesman for Blessed Grace So­cial Ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Ms Hameet Kha­nee, se­nior man­ager of the Fam­ily Ser­vices unit at AMP Sin­ga­pore, agrees.</p>
    <p>The non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion’s Debt Ad­vi­sory Cen­tre – which the Fam­ily Ser­vices unit over­sees – saw a rel­a­tively low num­ber of cases from April to June, but an in­crease from July to Septem­ber com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>“Con­sid­er­ing the rate of eco­nomic re­cov­ery and the pos­si­bil­ity of more re­trench­ments, com­pounded by the end or tight­en­ing of the var­i­ous Covid-19 sup­port grants, this may re­sult in more peo­ple hav­ing to dip fur­ther into their sav­ings. And for those who are in the red, they may start de­fault­ing on their loan re­pay­ment plans,” Ms Hameet said.</p>
    <p>At the same time, fewer peo­ple ap­pear to be bor­row­ing from li­censed money­len­ders and pawn­bro­kers.</p>
    <p>Credit As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (CAS) pres­i­dent Peter Tan said its mem­bers – li­censed money­len­ders – have seen 30 per cent to 50 per cent fewer cus­tomers on av­er­age since April, when the cir­cuit breaker kicked in.</p>
    <p>“I have been told by some of our mem­bers that dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, they even suf­fered a 90 per cent drop in busi­ness,” he said.</p>
    <p>In­di­vid­u­als who had dras­tic pay cuts or lost their jobs might be con­sid­ered “high risk” to li­censed money­len­ders as they might not be able to re­pay loans, he said. And fewer peo­ple might be con­fi­dent about tak­ing out ad­di­tional loans.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan added that CAS has asked its mem­bers to help trou­bled cus­tomers by re­struc­tur­ing their debts, in­clud­ing by de­fer­ring re­pay­ment or waiv­ing loan in­ter­est amounts.</p>
    <p>Pawn­bro­kers have seen a 15 per cent to 20 per cent drop in cus­tomers look­ing to pawn their valu­ables since the start of the cir­cuit breaker, said Mr Ivan Ho, pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore Pawn­bro­kers’ As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>He said the num­ber of peo­ple re­deem­ing valu­ables they had ear­lier pawned has in­creased by 30 per cent to 40 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Ho, who runs Heng Seng Pawn­shop at Toa Payoh Cen­tral, said ris­ing gold prices might have con­trib­uted to the in­crease in redemp­tion rates, as cus­tomers who are in need of money might redeem their valu­ables and sub­se­quently sell them to pawn­bro­kers for more cash.</p>
    <p>He urged peo­ple i n need of money to be cau­tious about tak­ing out loans un­less it is nec­es­sary, and in­stead try to “save as much as pos­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>Cases in­volv­ing il­le­gal loans have also dropped since the pan­demic started, com­pared with last year.</p>
    <p>There were 1,587 cases of un­li­censed mon­eylend­ing and re­lated ha­rass­ment be­tween April and Au­gust.</p>
    <p>“This was a 40 per cent de­crease from 2,642 cases re­ported dur­ing the same pe­riod in 2019,” said Min­is­ter for Home Af­fairs K. Shan­mugam in a writ­ten re­ply last month to a par­lia­men­tary ques­tion by Mr Melvin Yong, who is MP for Radin Mas.</p>
    <p>How­ever, said Mr Shan­mugam, the po­lice are step­ping up ef­forts to counter crimes re­lated to un­li­censed mon­eylend­ing, as the eco­nomic down­turn might en­cour­age peo­ple to seek il­le­gal loans.</p>
    <p>Be­tween Jan­uary and Septem­ber, four ma­jor en­force­ment op­er­a­tions were con­ducted, with 838 peo­ple ar­rested.</p>
    <p>“The po­lice are also ac­tively work­ing and shar­ing in­for­ma­tion with var­i­ous stake­hold­ers, in­clud­ing for­eign law en­force­ment agen­cies, to dis­man­tle loan-shark syn­di­cates that are op­er­at­ing out­side Sin­ga­pore,” the min­is­ter said.</p>
