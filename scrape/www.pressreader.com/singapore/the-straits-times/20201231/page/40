7mm thick rubber sleeve HOW THE FLOODGATES ARE INSTALLED Place Floodgate between the doorway and expand the jack by using a ratchet wrench to lock in the barrier horizontal­ly. Use the wrench to tighten the four bolts at the bottom, to lock in the barrier vertically. After the flood has receded, loosen the four bottom bolts and compress the jack to remove the Floodgate from the doorway. 1 2 3 Each set of PFB consists of

20kg and weighs about The panel is reusable and adjustable to fit securely within doorways ranging from 0.78m to 1.1m An extendable panel with an inflatable seal that provides temporary flood protection 0.6m QUICK AND SIMPLE INSTALLATI­ON WITHOUT TOOLS The panel is positioned across the doorway. A lever is used to extend the side panels until it touches the door frame. A pump is then activated to inflate a watertight seal around the panel. 2 3 1 Close-up of the watertight seal PORTABLE FLOOD BARRIER (PFB) A self-anchoring flood barrier that, when installed, creates a 0.5mhigh dam which helps divert flood water away from an area or contain them.

• The rear wall dams the flood water.
The water ’s pressure is absorbed by several large bulges, which also act as drainage channels. The barriers interlock with one another via a locking mechanism. Anchoring
• The anchoring force is proportion­al to the difference in water pressure between the upper and lower side of the boxwall.
• A system of drainage channels on the lower side diverts leaking water, so that no counter-pressure arises. Source: PUB ST PHOTOS: LIM K AILI, MARK CHEONG STRAITS TIMES GRAPHICS The base section of the boxwall is pressed firmly against the ground by the weight of the flood water. There is a pair of cellular rubber soles on the underside to provide a strong grip on the road. Sealing
Below the front edge is a sealing strip made of cellular rubber. This keeps the leakage of water at the bottom to a minimum. •
