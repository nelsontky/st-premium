    <p>ABU DHABI • World cham­pion Lewis Hamil­ton made a quiet re­turn to ac­tion af­ter recovering from Covid-19, com­ing in fifth in yes­ter­day’s open­ing prac­tice at the sea­son-end­ing Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>Red Bull’s Max Ver­stap­pen topped the times, clock­ing a best lap in 1min 37.378sec to out­pace Valt­teri Bot­tas by 0.034sec.</p>
    <p>Fel­low Mercedes driver Hamil­ton, who was 1.3sec slower, suf­fered brake prob­lems that sent him back to the garage just three laps af­ter he hit the track.</p>
    <p>The seven-time cham­pion missed last Sun­day’s Sakhir GP due to a pos­i­tive test. But Mercedes and the In­ter­na­tional Au­to­mo­bile Fed­er­a­tion both con­firmed on Thurs­day that he had re­turned sev­eral neg­a­tive tests af­ter com­plet­ing a 10-day quar­an­tine pe­riod in Bahrain.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton’s ab­sence from the Sakhir race was the first of his F1 ca­reer and came af­ter 265 con­sec­u­tive races since the Bri­ton made his 2007 de­but in Mel­bourne.</p>
    <p>His re­turn should re­store nor­mal or­der to Mercedes, whose pit-stop bun­gle cost both sub­sti­tute driver Ge­orge Rus­sell and Bot­tas last week­end.</p>
    <p>Rus­sell, who came ag­o­nis­ingly close to a shock maiden vic­tory, will re­turn to driv­ing for strug­glers Wil­liams but said he was still “buzzing” from his ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>The Bri­ton fin­ished i n the points for the first time, com­ing in ninth at Sakhir, and also clocked the fastest lap of the race.</p>
    <p>While Wil­liams are still with­out a point this sea­son, Rus­sell tweeted on Thurs­day, along with a photo of him­self in his Wil­liams rac­ing suit: “Back home at Wil­liams Rac­ing, check­ing it still fits! Did I miss much?</p>
    <p>“Se­ri­ously though, glad to see Lewis Hamil­ton back and fighting fit. Had a blast with Mercedes, but now I’m buzzing to put ev­ery­thing I’ve learned into ac­tion with my team. Gonna give it ev­ery­thing this week­end – just as they do for me week in, week out.”</p>
    <p>F1 ABU DHABI GP</p>
    <p>Prac­tice 3 (5.55pm) & qual­i­fy­ing (8.30pm), Sing­tel TV Ch114 & StarHub Ch208</p>
