    <p>Ac­tor Yeo Jin-goo, star of pop­u­lar K-drama Ho­tel Del Luna, who con­fessed that he has been “sin­gle since birth”, said he has no plans to go on a ro­mance re­al­ity series to find love for now. Yeo, 22, was speak­ing to me­dia from the re­gion to pro­mote new va­ri­ety series</p>
    <p>House On Wheels, in which he and two co-hosts go on coun­try­side trips in a tiny por­ta­ble house.</p>
    <p>South Korean child ac­tor-turned-lead­ing man Yeo Jin-goo is in no rush to get mar­ried or set­tle down de­spite con­fess­ing how he has been “sin­gle since birth” in his lat­est va­ri­ety series foray House On Wheels.</p>
    <p>In a video in­ter­view with re­gional me­dia, the 22-year-old laughed when asked if he might con­sider his co-hosts Sung Dong-il and Kim Hee-won’s sug­ges­tion that he go on a ro­mance re­al­ity series to find love.</p>
    <p>“It’ll be fun per­haps, but I have no serious thoughts on that right now,” he says.</p>
    <p>Yeo, best known for last year’s fan­tasy ro­mance drama Ho­tel Del Luna, adds: “Thoughts of get­ting mar­ried and hav­ing kids hit me when I see peo­ple like Sung Dong-il be­ing so happy with his beau­ti­ful fam­ily, but I have no de­tailed plans on how I want my fu­ture wife to be like or when I want to marry. It’s still ab­stract to me.”</p>
    <p>Sung, 56, a well-known vet­eran of South Korean en­ter­tain­ment, has three chil­dren, while Kim, 49, is a bach­e­lor.</p>
    <p>Yeo says the two vet­eran ac­tors were the big­gest fac­tor in his de­ci­sion to ap­pear in House On Wheels, which airs on Tues­days at 11pm on tvN (StarHub TV Chan­nel 824 and Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 518).</p>
    <p>The travel va­ri­ety series fol­lows the three hosts and their guests on coun­try­side trips in a tiny por­ta­ble house with only their es­sen­tial be­long­ings.</p>
    <p>The star says: “I’ve al­ways known them to be fun, hu­mor­ous peo­ple who can also be quite mis­chievous. They’re my se­niors in act­ing and life and have given me a lot of ad­vice on how to nur­ture my­self in life and at work.”</p>
    <p>Work­ing with Kim was an added ben­e­fit too as he had ex­pe­ri­ence driv­ing large ve­hi­cles, to suc­cess­fully take their por­ta­ble house on the road.</p>
    <p>Yeo says: “I wanted to do it, but man­ag­ing the speed and turn­ing cor­ners is quite dif­fi­cult and I’m aware of the risks, so I let Kim do most of the driv­ing.”</p>
    <p>The out­door show has also made Yeo’s life­style more “green” as the cast aim to leave no trace be­hind when they park their house i n scenic nat­u­ral sur­round­ings – by prac­tis­ing re­cy­cling and upcycling.</p>
    <p>And the show is a chance for Yeo to flaunt his en­thu­si­asm for cook­ing.</p>
    <p>He says: “I love cook­ing. If there’s a dish I want to try, I won’t be afraid of giv­ing it a shot.</p>
    <p>“A lot of the recipes I’ve at­tempted come from YouTube. It has de­tailed in­struc­tions and I just try to fol­low as close as I can.”</p>
    <p>He also re­united with Ho­tel Del Luna’s lead­ing lady, singer-ac­tress IU, in a re­cent episode.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing of his 27-year-old costar, he says: “She was just be­ing her­self like al­ways. She’s nat­u­ral, gen­uine and au­then­tic.”</p>
    <p>De­spite be­ing a cast mem­ber in the first sea­son of cook­ing re­al­ity series 4 Wheeled Restau­rant (2018), va­ri­ety series are still rel­a­tively new to Yeo, who made his act­ing de­but when he was eight.</p>
    <p>He adds: “I spend more time think­ing about whether I should join a va­ri­ety show be­cause I get ner­vous show­ing my true self.</p>
    <p>“What if view­ers don’t like watch­ing Yeo Jin-goo as him­self? But va­ri­ety can have a l ot of un­ex­pected mo­ments, which are in­ter­est­ing too.”</p>
    <p>House On Wheels airs on Tues­days at 11pm on TVN (STARHUB TV Chan­nel 824 and Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 518).</p>
