    <p>One day in Septem­ber when he was 24, Bri­tish au­thor Matt Haig went to the edge of a cliff in Ibiza, Spain, and con­sid­ered throw­ing him­self off it.</p>
    <p>It would have taken him a few steps for­ward. In the end, he turned and walked away.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery sum­mer that passes takes him fur­ther away from that mo­ment, says Haig. “I have al­ways liked mark­ing that pass­ing of time, be­cause ev­ery age I reach is an age I never thought I’d get to when I was sui­ci­dal.</p>
    <p>“I was 24 years old and I didn’t think I would live to be 25. I never thought I’d be 30. I’m 45 this year. It’s amaz­ing and it’s a great way to cope with get­ting older be­cause I thought I’d never be here, so ev­ery­thing is a priv­i­lege. To be alive is a priv­i­lege.”</p>
    <p>Haig is the au­thor of some 20 books, but the one he re­mains best known for is his 2015 best-sell­ing mem­oir Rea­sons To Stay Alive, in which he opens up about his bat­tle with se­vere de­pres­sion and the men­tal break­down that al­most led to his sui­cide.</p>
    <p>His new novel, The Mid­night Li­brary, is the clos­est he has got to rep­re­sent­ing his own ex­pe­ri­ence in fic­tion.</p>
    <p>Nora Seed, 35, lonely and de­pressed, de­cides to kill her­self, but at the stroke of mid­night finds her­self in a li­brary be­tween life and death, where each book on the shelf is a chance for her to ex­plore an­other life she could have had.</p>
    <p>She could ex­pe­ri­ence the life in which she be­came an Olympic swim­mer, for in­stance, or the one in which the band she and her brother formed be­came a global phe­nom­e­non, or even the one in which she was an Arc­tic glaciol­o­gist.</p>
    <p>She must find the right life to set­tle down in, even as time, how­ever mys­te­ri­ously it works in the li­brary, be­gins to run out.</p>
    <p>“I’ve al­ways been fas­ci­nated by par­al­lel lives,” says Haig over Skype from his home in Britain, where he lives with his wife and two chil­dren aged 11 and 12. “A li­brary is sort of like a place full of par­al­lel lives, where you can es­cape into dif­fer­ent worlds.”</p>
    <p>Li­braries have a spe­cial place in his heart. When he was grow­ing up in the small English town of Ne­wark, where there was no cinema, no book­shops and noth­ing to do, he would spend his af­ter­noons in the great glass li­brary at the cen­tre of town.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t al­ways have a great time at school,” he says. “Be­ing able to just sit in this gi­ant green­house of a li­brary was great.”</p>
    <p>If there was ever a time to write a book cham­pi­oning li­braries, he adds, it would be now.</p>
    <p>“In Eng­land, as in quite a few places in the world, li­braries aren’t par­tic­u­larly val­ued at the mo­ment and their bud­gets are be­ing cut. And be­cause this year has been so dev­as­tat­ing for the econ­omy, I think li­braries are go­ing to suf­fer even more.</p>
    <p>“I think there’s a mis­con­cep­tion that be­cause of the In­ter­net, we don’t need li­braries any more. But li­braries are about so much more than just go­ing to get a book. It’s im­por­tant to have these pub­lic civic spa­ces. They’re also im­por­tant for democ­racy and ac­ces­si­bil­ity be­cause not ev­ery­one can af­ford to buy ev­ery hard­back book they want and not ev­ery­one can af­ford to study.”</p>
    <p>Not ev­ery­thing Haig writes is about men­tal health.</p>
    <p>His many books in­clude The Last Fam­ily In Eng­land (2004), a re­work­ing of Shake­speare’s Henry IV</p>
    <p>Part I, but told by dogs; The Radleys (2010), a young adult tale about middle-class vam­pires; and How To Stop Time, his 2017 novel about a man who has been alive for more than 400 years.</p>
    <p>What con­nects his pro­tag­o­nists, he says, is that they are all out­siders.</p>
    <p>“I’m al­ways care­ful never to just write about men­tal health,” he says.</p>
    <p>“I try not to stay in the lane of de­pres­sion. But also the act of writ­ing and talk­ing about de­pres­sion is ac­tu­ally help­ful to me in it­self and be­cause it’s brought a lot of peo­ple to me, which has made my own men­tal health jour­ney feel less lonely.</p>
    <p>“I think one of the sub­con­scious rea­sons I started writ­ing about de­pres­sion was that I wanted to feel less weird and strange, be­cause when I be­came ill when I was young, what was dan­ger­ous about it was that I felt to­tally alone. I thought, no one has felt like this. Of course, that’s not true. Lots and lots of peo­ple feel like this.”</p>
    <p>These days, ev­ery­one seems to be try­ing to bring his books to screen, from an adap­ta­tion of How To Stop Time pro­duced by and star­ring Bene­dict Cum­ber­batch, to the up­com­ing film A Boy Called Christ­mas, a reimag­in­ing of the Father Christ­mas story.</p>
    <p>Rea­sons To Stay Alive has been turned into a tele­vi­sion drama by Bri­tish broad­caster UKTV.</p>
    <p>Haig de­scribes at­tend­ing a screen­ing last year as “a very weird ex­pe­ri­ence, al­most like be­ing on drugs”.</p>
    <p>He re­calls: “You’re watch­ing your­self, who’s not your­self, go through the worst time of your life... It was quite an in­tense hour and I came out with a headache.”</p>
    <p>Even though it has caused him so much pain, he would not choose a life in which he did not have de­pres­sion. “If given a choice to press a but­ton that said, ‘You’ve never had de­pres­sion or a panic attack in your life’, I would not press that but­ton.</p>
    <p>“I have hon­estly known more hap­pi­ness this side of be­ing men­tally ill than I ever did be­fore, as a young adult or child. And I think that is be­cause of my ex­pe­ri­ence, which has made me more grate­ful and look after my men­tal health.”</p>
    <p>He is now work­ing on a nonfiction book with the broad ti­tle of The Com­fort Book, which he says as­sem­bles bits and pieces of com­fort­ing quotes and ad­vice that might be help­ful to read­ers, given the on­go­ing Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“This year has been par­tic­u­larly stress­ful for ev­ery­body,” he says. “And I al­ways try and write the book I would most want to read at that point in time.”</p>
