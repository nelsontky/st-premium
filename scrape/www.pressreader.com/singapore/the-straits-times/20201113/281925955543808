    <p>I ap­plaud the na­tion’s lead­ers for em­brac­ing more dig­i­tal platforms for cit­i­zen feed­back, which in­creases ac­cess and con­ve­nience – es­pe­cially im­por­tant in to­day’s in­creas­ingly dig­i­talised world. The means by which feed­back can be given in­clude e-Meet-the-Peo­ple Ses­sions (e-MPS), e-mail, or apps such as OneSer­vice.</p>
    <p>But I have so far been unim­pressed with the re­sponses.</p>
    <p>I have been giv­ing feed­back over the past year about some­one’s home alarm go­ing off in the wee hours in my neigh­bour­hood, which has dis­turbed sleep and caused anx­i­ety.</p>
    <p>I have writ­ten in to my town coun­cil, as well as through OneSer­vice and, most re­cently, e-MPS. Each time, I have been re­ferred to the Hous­ing Board, which pro­vides a link that ex­pires af­ter a cer­tain du­ra­tion, af­ter which all cor­re­spon­dence ceases.</p>
    <p>With my most re­cent e-mail via e-MPS in July, I sought more at­ten­tion for my case, see­ing that there was poor fol­low-up each time.</p>
    <p>I did not re­ceive a re­ply un­til I pro­vided my ad­dress and NRIC num­ber – which I found odd, given that the alarm was af­fect­ing not only my house­hold. I was once again re­ferred to the HDB.</p>
    <p>A fol­low-up e-mail in Septem­ber via e-MPS to ask why I re­ceived a re­ply only when my NRIC num­ber was pro­vided went unan­swered.</p>
    <p>I have also not been con­tacted by the HDB.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve that more ac­count­abil­ity and re­spon­sive­ness are ex­pected on these platforms. Mr Alex Yeo had sim­i­lar feed­back (Bet­ter com­mu­ni­ca­tion by govt agen­cies can go a long way, Sept 19).</p>
    <p>It is en­cour­ag­ing to hear more prom­ises by the au­thor­i­ties to lis­ten to feed­back from cit­i­zens, but if some of these platforms have not been shown to help, then these prom­ises just ring hol­low.</p>
    <p>Many cit­i­zens be­lieve the Gov­ern­ment is do­ing much be­hind the scenes, but too of­ten, there is poor com­mu­ni­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Agen­cies can some­times make mis­takes, and that is the pur­pose of hav­ing a feed­back mech­a­nism. But if things do not im­prove af­ter feed­back is given, then some­thing may be wrong with that mech­a­nism. Lim Wei Yang</p>
