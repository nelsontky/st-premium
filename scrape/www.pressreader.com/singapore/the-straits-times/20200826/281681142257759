    <p>News that a 33-year-old man in Hong Kong was re­in­fected with Covid-19 has sparked fears that peo­ple can get the dis­ease more than once. But in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­perts said such cases are rare and not a cause for worry, un­less many more cases sur­face.</p>
    <p>Most peo­ple develop a ro­bust im­mune re­sponse af­ter a Covid-19 in­fec­tion, but for rea­sons that are cur­rently un­known, the man in Hong Kong had failed to mount an an­ti­body re­sponse to the first in­fec­tion in late March.</p>
    <p>He was hos­pi­talised and dis­charged on April 14 af­ter two neg­a­tive swabs from his na­sophar­ynx and throat. Then he tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 on a saliva test on Aug 15, af­ter re­turn­ing from a trip to Spain via Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Univer­sity of Hong Kong (HKU) re­searchers said they have found the world’s first doc­u­mented case of re­in­fec­tion, af­ter they se­quenced the virus from the man’s in­fec­tions and found that he had a dif­fer­ent strain from the one in March.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Paul Tambyah, a se­nior in­fec­tious dis­eases con­sul­tant at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal, said: “The likely rea­son he was re­in­fected with a dif­fer­ent strain is that he had no de­tectable an­ti­bod­ies af­ter the first in­fec­tion – pos­si­bly be­cause it was so mild (he was asymp­to­matic by the time he was hos­pi­talised), but also pos­si­bly be­cause of some un­com­mon spe­cific im­mune de­fect.”</p>
    <p>This ap­pears to be a rare case, “just like we oc­ca­sion­ally get peo­ple who have two episodes of chicken pox or even measles”, he added.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, there are more than 23 mil­lion Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the Hong Kong case, there have been only some anec­do­tal re­ports of re­in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est­ingly, the Hong Kong man had no symp­toms the sec­ond time around, while dur­ing his first in­fec­tion, the symp­toms were mild.</p>
    <p>Prof Tambyah said the first in­fec­tion seems to have pro­tected the man from a se­ri­ous in­fec­tion dur­ing the sec­ond ex­po­sure.</p>
    <p>It also primed him for a late an­ti­body re­sponse when ex­posed to the virus again, even though it was a dif­fer­ent strain.</p>
    <p>Yale Univer­sity im­mu­nol­o­gist Akiko Iwasaki said on Twit­ter that the man’s im­mu­nity pro­tected him from be­ing sick with Covid-19, even if it was not enough to block re­in­fec­tion. But what was en­cour­ag­ing is that while he had no de­tectable an­ti­bod­ies at the time of re­in­fec­tion, he de­vel­oped de­tectable an­ti­bod­ies af­ter it, she added.</p>
    <p>She fur­ther said that since re­in­fec­tion can oc­cur, herd im­mu­nity by nat­u­ral in­fec­tion is un­likely to elim­i­nate the virus that causes Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The only safe and ef­fec­tive way to achieve herd im­mu­nity is through vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>The HKU re­searchers re­port­edly said the re­in­fec­tion case would mean those who have been in­fected with Covid-19 should still be of­fered vac­ci­na­tion, and com­ply with mask-wear­ing and so­cial dis­tanc­ing restric­tions.</p>
    <p>Their study is re­port­edly due for pub­li­ca­tion in the Amer­i­can jour­nal Clin­i­cal In­fec­tious Dis­eases.</p>
    <p>Said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Hsu Li Yang, an in­fec­tious dis­eases spe­cial­ist from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health: “This is a sin­gle case, but rep­re­sents some­thing we felt was plau­si­ble – that im­mu­nity post-in­fec­tion may not be life­long, just like for other hu­man coro­n­aviruses or in­fluenza.”</p>
    <p>Vac­cine-con­ferred im­mu­nity may not be life­long as well, but it may per­haps be more like in­fluenza vac­cines in which re­peated vac­ci­na­tions are re­quired, he added.</p>
    <p>Still, Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong, deputy di­rec­tor of Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School’s emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases pro­gramme, pointed out that the im­mune re­sponse to vac­ci­na­tion is dif­fer­ent from that to a SarsCoV-2 in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>“The virus con­tains ge­netic el­e­ments that are able to sup­press our im­mune re­sponse, whereas vac­cines are de­signed to stim­u­late these re­sponses,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The re­sul­tant im­mu­nity from vac­ci­na­tion and in­fec­tion would likely be dif­fer­ent.”</p>
    <p>There are still a lot of un­knowns about the Hong Kong case.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, it is not known if the re­in­fected man was able to mount a T-cell re­sponse to the ini­tial in­fec­tion, even if he did not have an an­ti­body re­sponse, said Prof Tambyah.</p>
    <p>T-cells, an es­sen­tial part of the im­mune sys­tem, may of­fer long-last­ing im­mu­nity against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>POS­SI­BLE MILD FIRST IN­FEC­TION</p>
    <p>The likely rea­son he was re­in­fected with a dif­fer­ent strain is that he had no de­tectable an­ti­bod­ies af­ter the first in­fec­tion – pos­si­bly be­cause it was so mild (he was asymp­to­matic by the time he was hos­pi­talised), but also pos­si­bly be­cause of some un­com­mon spe­cific im­mune de­fect.</p>
    <p>PRO­FES­SOR PAUL TAMBYAH, a se­nior in­fec­tious dis­eases con­sul­tant at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal, not­ing that it could be “just like we oc­ca­sion­ally get peo­ple who have two episodes of chicken pox or even measles”.</p>
    <p>This is a sin­gle case, but rep­re­sents some­thing we felt was plau­si­ble – that im­mu­nity post-in­fec­tion may not be life­long, just like for other hu­man coro­n­aviruses or in­fluenza.</p>
    <p>DIF­FER­ENT IM­MUNE RE­SPONSES</p>
    <p>The virus con­tains ge­netic el­e­ments that are able to sup­press our im­mune re­sponse, whereas vac­cines are de­signed to stim­u­late these re­sponses. The re­sul­tant im­mu­nity from vac­ci­na­tion and in­fec­tion would likely ’’ be dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>PRO­FES­SOR OOI ENG EONG, deputy di­rec­tor of Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School’s emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases pro­gramme, not­ing that the im­mune re­sponse to vac­ci­na­tion is dif­fer­ent from that to a Sars-CoV-2 in­fec­tion.</p>
