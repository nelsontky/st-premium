    <p>SPIEL­BERG (Aus­tria) • World mo­tor­cy­cling star Valentino Rossi has said a ri­val’s stray bike, trav­el­ling at around 300kmh, al­most “killed me” in a hor­ri­fy­ing near-miss at the Aus­trian Grand Prix on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The nine-time world cham­pion was left badly shaken af­ter Franco Mor­bidelli’s Yamaha flew across the track just cen­time­tres in front of him.</p>
    <p>His fel­low Ital­ian and the Du­cati of Jo­hann Zarco had col­lided just sec­onds be­fore the rid­ers slipped through an early turn on Lap 8.</p>
    <p>Both men were un­seated and the free-wheel­ing Du­cati came des­per­ately close to hit­ting Rossi as well as his Yamaha team­mate Mav­er­ick Vi­nales, who was just ahead of him.</p>
    <p>“Mor­bidelli’s bike nearly killed me,” fumed Rossi, 41. “Even Zarco’s Du­cati passed a few me­tres over me, it was a very dan­ger­ous mo­ment.”</p>
    <p>He man­aged to com­pose him­self and af­ter the race was restarted, he came home in fifth place.</p>
    <p>“I was so scared. I am shaken, re­sum­ing the race was tough. I took the big­gest risk of my ca­reer,” he told Sky Italia. “I saw a shadow, I thought it was the he­li­copter from above...</p>
    <p>“In­stead, two ‘ bul­lets’ ar­rived. The saint of mo­tor­cy­clists to­day did a re­ally great job, it was a very dan­ger­ous thing.”</p>
    <p>Mor­bidelli and Zarco were both de­clared fit af­ter vis­it­ing the cir­cuit med­i­cal cen­tre but the former did not mince his words, telling Sky the French rider was “al­most a mur­derer”.</p>
    <p>“Brak­ing like this at 300kmh means hav­ing little love for your­self or for those you are rac­ing against,” he said. “I hope this ma­jor incident makes Zarco think.”</p>
    <p>Rossi agreed, claim­ing too many of his fel­low Mo­toGP rid­ers were risk-tak­ers with­out un­der­stand­ing “our bikes, at these speeds, are bul­lets”. “We’re com­pet­ing in a very dan­ger­ous sport, you have to have re­spect for those who run on the track with you,” he added.</p>
