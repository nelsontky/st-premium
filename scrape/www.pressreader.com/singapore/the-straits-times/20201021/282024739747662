    <p>Loot boxes in video games, in­clud­ing mo­bile ti­tles, are akin to vir­tual goodie bags that have ran­dom re­wards.</p>
    <p>They can be bought with dig­i­tal cur­ren­cies earned in a game or pur­chased in­di­rectly with real cash, and as­sume such names as card packs, sum­mons and sup­ply crates.</p>
    <p>Loot boxes tend to be found in mo­bile games that are free to down­load, but have also made their way into paid PC and con­sole games.</p>
    <p>Games with loot boxes are some­times also called “Gacha” games, a term that comes from the Ja­panese cap­sule-toy vend­ing machines called Gashapon or Gachapon.</p>
    <p>Some coun­sel­lors have ar­gued that vir­tual loot boxes are more eas­ily ac­ces­si­ble than their phys­i­cal coun­ter­parts such as sticker packs, be­cause the bar­ri­ers to get peo­ple to buy loot boxes are lower. This is due to their dig­i­tal na­ture and how they are worked into a game.</p>
    <p>Some play­ers may also not even think that they are spend­ing real money on the loot boxes.</p>
    <p>LOW ODDS</p>
    <p>A loot box can be worth the equiv­a­lent of a few dol­lars in real cash, but it of­ten can­not be traded for ac­tual money.</p>
    <p>Prized re­wards from th­ese boxes can have a low chance of less than 1 per cent of drop­ping, with some re­port­edly be­ing as low as 0.00005 per cent.</p>
    <p>Rare re­wards can give gamers a big ad­van­tage, such as a weapon that makes a player’s char­ac­ter more pow­er­ful.</p>
    <p>In other in­stances, the re­wards are cos­metic to dress up game char­ac­ters.</p>
    <p>GAM­BLING FEARS</p>
    <p>So­cial work­ers and video game ex­perts have raised con­cerns over the ad­dic­tive­ness of loot boxes, say­ing the thrill of not know­ing what one might get stim­u­lates the pro­duc­tion of a chem­i­cal known as dopamine which is linked to re­wards and mo­ti­va­tion.</p>
    <p>This can make loot boxes very ad­dic­tive.</p>
    <p>Such mar­ket­ing tac­tics are seen to some de­gree in the real world, where on­line stores sell­ing beauty prod­ucts hold mys­tery box pro­mo­tions.</p>
    <p>Some ad­dic­tion ex­perts have also likened the sen­sory trig­gers from the sound ef­fects and an­i­ma­tions of open­ing loot boxes to play­ing slot machines in casi­nos.</p>
    <p>GOV­ERN­MENT AC­TION</p>
    <p>Sev­eral coun­tries have taken ac­tion against loot boxes.</p>
    <p>Bel­gium banned them from games in 2018. The Bel­gian Gam­ing Com­mis­sion looked into the mat­ter af­ter harsh pub­lic crit­i­cism glob­ally of the Star Wars Bat­tle­front II game re­leased in Novem­ber 2017.</p>
    <p>The game ini­tially had loot boxes, but they were re­moved af­ter the fall­out from fans and gamers.</p>
    <p>In June this year, Bri­tain’s Depart­ment of Dig­i­tal, Cul­ture, Me­dia and Sport launched a call for ev­i­dence in its in­ves­ti­ga­tion to de­ter­mine whether to re­clas­sify video games with loot boxes as gam­bling prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>If min­is­ters in Bri­tain opt to re­clas­sify loot boxes, game devel­op­ers could be forced to pull some ti­tles or re­design them so that they can be sold to peo­ple aged un­der 18.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Ap­ple has re­quired game devel­op­ers to re­veal the odds of get­ting loot box prizes in games on its App Store since 2017. Google im­ple­mented sim­i­lar re­quire­ments on its app store last year.</p>
