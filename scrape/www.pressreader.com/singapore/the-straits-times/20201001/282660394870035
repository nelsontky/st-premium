    <p>Aries</p>
    <p>(March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Stay ac­tive. Keep push­ing your­self through the slow patches as they arise and your amaz­ing per­sonal en­ergy should see you through.</p>
    <p>Taurus</p>
    <p>(April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Try to ab­sorb more in­for­ma­tion – things are un­clear, so make sure you know what you’re talk­ing about when things start to get weird.</p>
    <p>Gemini</p>
    <p>(May 21 - June 20) Some­one you know in­for­mally plays a ma­jor role in your day – so pay at­ten­tion. You may not even re­alise what is hap­pen­ing un­til it is over.</p>
    <p>Can­cer</p>
    <p>(June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>You are on a col­li­sion course with an author­ity fig­ure. It may not work out the way you want, but you can pre­pare for what comes af­ter.</p>
    <p>Leo</p>
    <p>(July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You could fi­nally be ready to take on that new class or project. Your abil­ity to learn new con­cepts is at an all-time high.</p>
    <p>Virgo</p>
    <p>(Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Your ter­rific en­ergy lev­els make you speed­ier than most of the peo­ple around you. Do not worry about them – they should re­cover quickly.</p>
    <p>Li­bra</p>
    <p>(Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties abound, so get out there. Your con­nec­tions should be able to help you find new ways of mak­ing money.</p>
    <p>Scorpio</p>
    <p>(Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>When was the last time you hit the gym or took a long walk? Com­mit to healthy ac­tiv­i­ties. Even once a week is fine, as long as you start now.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s</p>
    <p>(Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Your en­ergy is un­stop­pable – so go out and do some­thing amaz­ing. What­ever you start is sure to work out well in the long run.</p>
    <p>Capricorn</p>
    <p>(Dec 22 - Jan 19) Some­thing has been trou­bling you lately, so see if you can just con­front it di­rectly. Fret­ting just works you up with­out ac­com­plish­ing any­thing.</p>
    <p>Aquarius</p>
    <p>(Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You feel al­tru­is­tic, so ex­am­ine the sit­u­a­tion with clear eyes. Oth­er­wise, you may send your en­ergy to the wrong place or overdo it.</p>
    <p>Pisces</p>
    <p>(Feb 19 - March 20) Some­thing that has been hid­den from you may re­veal it­self or get un­cov­ered in the course of the day. Get ready for a sur­prise.</p>
