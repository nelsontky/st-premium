    <p>BANGKOK • The maker of en­ergy drink gi­ant Red Bull has dis­tanced it­self from its Thai heir fol­low­ing public out­rage af­ter po­lice dropped charges against the bil­lion­aire scion in a fa­tal hit-and-run case.</p>
    <p>Mr Vo­rayuth “Boss” Yoovid­hya, the grand­son of Mr Cha­leo Yoovid­hya – who co-founded Red Bull – and one of the heirs to the fam­ily’s busi­ness, was ac­cused of killing a po­lice of­fi­cer in 2012 when he crashed his Fer­rari in Bangkok’s most exclusive neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>An ar­rest war­rant came five years later, but by then he had fled in a pri­vate jet to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, po­lice con­firmed the re­main­ing charges against him had been dropped, in­clud­ing reck­less driv­ing caus­ing death.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion stirred out­rage among the Thai public over the cul­ture of im­punity en­joyed by the king­dom’s rich, with the hash­tags #BossRedBul­l and #Boy­cottRed­Bull trend­ing on Twit­ter in both English and Thai over the week­end.</p>
    <p>Late on Satur­day, TCP Group – the Thai par­ent com­pany of the en­ergy drink gi­ant – re­leased a state­ment on the “mis­un­der­stand­ing” over Mr Vo­rayuth’s re­la­tion­ship with the com­pany.</p>
    <p>He “has never as­sumed any role in the man­age­ment and daily op­er­a­tions of TCP Group, was never a share­holder, nor has he held any ex­ec­u­tive po­si­tion within TCP Group”, the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>It said the case is Mr Vo­rayuth’s “per­sonal af­fair”.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the ar­rest war­rant was is­sued in 2017, Mr Vo­rayuth con­tin­ued to lead a lav­ish, jet-set­ting lifestyle, mak­ing public ap­pear­ances at Red Bull-spon­sored events.</p>
    <p>A fam­ily em­ployee ini­tially took the blame in the case be­fore me­dia scru­tiny forced the po­lice to re­view their in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said last Fri­day that they had re­ceived a let­ter last month from the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s of­fice with its de­ci­sion to drop the charges, de­clin­ing to pro­vide a rea­son.</p>
    <p>An im­mi­gra­tion spokesman told Agence France-Presse that Mr Vo­rayuth’s name has been off the black­list since July 14 at the re­quest of the po­lice, and his last recorded de­par­ture was in April 2017.</p>
