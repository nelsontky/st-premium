    <p>The re­cent de­bate on the use of TraceTo­gether data in po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions has gen­er­ated di­vi­sive views. These range from pas­sion­ate claims of “if you have noth­ing to hide, you have noth­ing to fear” to mus­ings on the con­tin­ued use of the TraceTo­gether app.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve a ma­jor­ity of views, like mine, lie some­where in the mid­dle. Should we not have per­sonal data pri­vacy, a ro­bust pan­demic re­sponse sys­tem as well as ef­fec­tive and ef­fi­cient law en­force­ment? Cer­tainly, with more than 70 per cent of Sin­ga­pore­ans us­ing the app and the pan­demic still here to stay for a while more, it is some­thing we should strive to­wards.</p>
    <p>Does such a so­lu­tion ex­ist? In fact, ef­fec­tively man­ag­ing per­sonal data (along with per­haps pre­vent­ing cy­ber at­tacks) al­most seems an un­solv­able task.</p>
    <p>How­ever, this has not stopped oth­ers from try­ing. For ex­am­ple, Bri­tain has set up its In­for­ma­tion Com­mis­sioner’s Of­fice as an in­de­pen­dent public body to up­hold in­for­ma­tion rights.</p>
    <p>France has a sim­i­lar of­fice, and</p>
    <p>Fin­land has its Of­fice of the Data Pro­tec­tion Om­buds­man. All three are in­de­pen­dent in­for­ma­tion and data pro­tec­tion bod­ies that serve to guard the pri­vacy of per­sonal data.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the Per­sonal Data Pro­tec­tion Com­mis­sion (PDPC) has been tasked with ad­min­is­ter­ing and en­forc­ing the Per­sonal Data Pro­tec­tion Act. It also serves as Sin­ga­pore’s main au­thor­ity in mat­ters re­lat­ing to per­sonal data pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>Cre­at­ing a com­ple­men­tary but in­de­pen­dent per­sonal data pro­tec­tion body may be a step in the right di­rec­tion. A body that can work with the PDPC to reg­u­late how per­sonal data, in­clud­ing data gath­ered by the public au­thor­i­ties, is utilised.</p>
    <p>Cru­cially (and iron­i­cally), to mit­i­gate pri­vacy is­sues, the body set up should have its in­de­pen­dence, in­so­far as pos­si­ble, guar­an­teed through both its com­po­si­tion and or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Ide­al­is­tic. But so were as­pi­ra­tions be­hind Sin­ga­pore’s many other suc­cesses.</p>
