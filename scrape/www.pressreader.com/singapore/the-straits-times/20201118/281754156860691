    <p>The In­dian cap­i­tal is in the grip of a third and more intense wave of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of doc­tors and paramed­i­cal per­son­nel are be­ing flown into the city, hos­pi­tals are adding beds and med­i­cal teams are fan­ning out to con­duct house-to-house sur­veys as the au­thor­i­ties try to con­tain the sit­u­a­tion with emer­gency mea­sures.</p>
    <p>New Delhi reg­is­tered 3,797 new cases on Mon­day, the high­est num­ber in the coun­try, and the fig­ure was a sharp jump from that at the be­gin­ning of Oc­to­ber when fewer than 2,000 cases were recorded.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new in­fec­tions, how­ever, was down from 7,000 last week although the fall was at­trib­uted largely to the drop in test­ing over the past three days in the cap­i­tal and else­where due to an ex­tended hol­i­day week­end.</p>
    <p>Still, the over­all down­ward trend around the coun­try is con­tin­u­ing, with 29,163 cases recorded on Mon­day – a four-month low.</p>
    <p>Epi­demi­ol­o­gist Shahid Jameel, in ex­plain­ing the dis­par­ity, noted that the im­pact of the coro­n­avirus in In­dia, with its vast size and pop­u­la­tion, was not uni­form.</p>
    <p>“Ups and downs will con­tinue to take place in dif­fer­ent places at dif­fer­ent times,” he said.</p>
    <p>An of­fi­cial in the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs said that 75 doc­tors and 250 paramedics are be­ing dis­patched to the cap­i­tal in batches. The doc­tors be­gan ar­riv­ing on Mon­day and will be in place over the next two to three days while the paramedics will be de­ployed within a week.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cial said 10 multi-dis­ci­plinary teams, con­sist­ing of of­fi­cials from the health min­istry, All In­dia In­sti­tute of Med­i­cal Sci­ences and home min­istry, were vis­it­ing 115 pri­vate hos­pi­tals in Delhi to look at bed util­i­sa­tion and test­ing ca­pac­ity and to scope for ad­di­tional in­ten­sive care unit (ICU) beds.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the Delhi state gov­ern­ment re­versed a de­ci­sion to al­low 200 peo­ple to at­tend wed­ding re­cep­tions, cut­ting that num­ber down to 50. It is also con­sid­er­ing clos­ing mar­kets where so­cial dis­tanc­ing is not be­ing fol­lowed.</p>
    <p>“We will send a pro­posal to the cen­tral gov­ern­ment re­quest­ing them to al­low us to tem­po­rar­ily close those mar­kets where we see ram­pant vi­o­la­tion of so­cial dis­tanc­ing norms and Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions, which we as­sess as po­ten­tial hot spots,” said Delhi Chief Min­is­ter Arvind Ke­jri­wal in a video mes­sage.</p>
    <p>Delhi, which has a pop­u­la­tion of more than 19.8 mil­lion peo­ple, has strug­gled to con­trol the pan­demic. It has reg­is­tered a to­tal of over 489,000 cases and a death toll of 7,713.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts blame sev­eral fac­tors for the city’s predica­ment.</p>
    <p>Delhi is a melt­ing pot with dif­fer­ent com­mu­ni­ties, lead­ing to pro­longed fes­tive cel­e­bra­tions com­pared to other parts of the coun­try. The fes­tiv­i­ties range from Deep­avali or Di­wali, the Fes­ti­val of</p>
    <p>Lights, to Karwa Chauth, a north In­dian fes­ti­val cel­e­brated by women for the well-be­ing of their hus­bands.</p>
    <p>Such cel­e­bra­tions usu­ally mean crowds will throng mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Another fac­tor seems tied to the city’s du­bi­ous distinc­tion as one of the most pol­luted cities in the world. The an­nual spike in air pol­lu­tion oc­curs ev­ery winter due to the burn­ing of stub­ble by farm­ers to clear land in neigh­bour­ing states. The en­su­ing pol­lu­tion adds to the smog caused by ve­hi­cles and fac­to­ries in the con­gested city.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral in­ter­na­tional stud­ies have es­tab­lished a cor­re­la­tion be­tween pol­lu­tion and the mor­tal­ity rate from Covid-19. Delhi’s air qual­ity re­mained in the un­healthy range yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts say there is also “Covid fatigue” among the pop­u­la­tion, with lax at­ti­tudes to­wards the wear­ing of masks as rules on so­cial dis­tanc­ing are loos­ened amid a re­turn to life in pre-Covid-19 days with re­gard to go­ing to work, trav­el­ling on pub­lic trans­port, so­cial­is­ing and shop­ping.</p>
    <p>Dr Vivek Nan­gia, an in­ter­ven­tional pul­mo­nolo­gist and prin­ci­pal di­rec­tor and head of Max Su­per Spe­cial­ity Hos­pi­tal, warned that the sit­u­a­tion in Delhi was dire.</p>
    <p>“The hos­pi­tals are al­ready packed. In the ear­lier (waves), only ICU beds were full and other beds were avail­able,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that health­care pro­fes­sion­als in the city were ex­hausted.</p>
    <p>“This time, we have seen a younger crowd in their 30s and 40s com­ing in. Ear­lier, it was the el­derly and those with co­mor­bidi­ties. It is be­cause th­ese younger peo­ple are mov­ing around.</p>
    <p>“I think the main ad­vice is that we should re­strict our move­ments to a bare min­i­mum. We should con­sider a self lockdown, es­pe­cially those who are vul­ner­a­ble,” said Dr Nan­gia.</p>
    <p>Delhi Health Min­is­ter Satyen­dar Jain be­lieves the peak of the third phase for Covid-19 in­fec­tions is over but ex­perts dis­agree, say­ing that the im­pact of the re­cent fes­tive sea­son will be ap­par­ent over the next two weeks.</p>
