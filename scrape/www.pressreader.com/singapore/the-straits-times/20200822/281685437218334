    <p>Around 120,000 stu­dents this year will be sit­ting the year-end national ex­am­i­na­tions amid the Covid-19 pan­demic. To guard against dis­rup­tions and in­fec­tions, stu­dents who dis­play symp­toms close to their exam dates will not be al­lowed to en­ter the ex­am­i­na­tion venue pend­ing their swab re­sults.</p>
    <p>This is among a se­ries of mea­sures the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion and the Sin­ga­pore Ex­am­i­na­tions and As­sess­ment Board have in­tro­duced to en­sure that the ex­ams can take place.</p>
    <p>Q How and where can stu­dents get tested for Covid-19?</p>
    <p>A A grad­u­at­ing stu­dent who is un­well should see a doc­tor at a gen­eral prac­ti­tioner (GP) clinic par­tic­i­pat­ing in the Swab-andSend-Home (Sash) ini­tia­tive, or a poly­clinic.</p>
    <p>They should do so es­pe­cially if they have res­pi­ra­tory symp­toms such as runny nose, cough or sore throat, or have a fever.</p>
    <p>If di­ag­nosed by the doc­tor to have an acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion, the stu­dent will be re­quired to be tested for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion (PSLE) pupils who dis­play symp­toms close to the date of exam, from Sept 28 on­wards, as well as dur­ing the exam it­self, should seek med­i­cal at­ten­tion at KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>This is to en­sure timely di­ag­no­sis and no­ti­fi­ca­tion of re­sults, should they be di­ag­nosed with acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion and re­quire Covid-19 testing.</p>
    <p>For stu­dents tak­ing the N, O or A lev­els who dis­play symp­toms four days be­fore the start of their re­spec­tive ex­am­i­na­tion, they should seek med­i­cal at­ten­tion at poly­clin­ics.</p>
    <p>While await­ing no­ti­fi­ca­tion of the Covid-19 swab test re­sults, stu­dents must stay home and will not be al­lowed to en­ter the ex­am­i­na­tion venue.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents aged 16 years and younger should be ac­com­pa­nied by an adult for the swab test – for con­sent-tak­ing and com­mu­ni­ca­tion to both the stu­dent and adult on the pre­cau­tions to take note of while await­ing the test re­sults at home.</p>
    <p>Q As national ex­am­i­na­tions are es­sen­tial for pro­gres­sion, can special pro­vi­sions or al­ter­na­tive ar­range­ments be made, such as on­line in­vig­i­la­tion for can­di­dates who are con­firmed cases or who are on stay-home no­tice (SHN) and home quar­an­tine or­der?</p>
    <p>A There are no plans for on­line in­vig­i­la­tion ar­range­ments, which in­volve can­di­dates tak­ing ex­am­i­na­tions at home.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause the fair­ness and in­tegrity of the national ex­am­i­na­tions may be com­pro­mised.</p>
    <p>There are also chal­lenges in the man­age­ment and pro­vi­sion of re­sources for on­line in­vig­i­la­tion, given that it in­volves the ad­min­is­tra­tion of the ex­ams in in­di­vid­ual homes.</p>
    <p>Q What hap­pens if there is a con­firmed case in a school dur­ing the national ex­am­i­na­tions?</p>
    <p>A If there is a con­firmed case, all close con­tacts of the case will be iden­ti­fied, and schools may sus­pend classes and ac­tiv­i­ties for dis­in­fec­tion and deep clean­ing of af­fected ar­eas, as well as for con­tact trac­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tions to be com­pleted.</p>
    <p>Special con­sid­er­a­tion will be ap­plied for af­fected stu­dents to en­sure that they are not dis­ad­van­taged for the national ex­am­i­na­tions.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents who are un­af­fected will ei­ther con­tinue to take their ex­am­i­na­tions in an­other class­room block within the school, or in an ex­am­i­na­tion venue man­aged by the Sin­ga­pore Ex­am­i­na­tions and As­sess­ment Board (SEAB).</p>
    <p>Q What pro­vi­sions are there for stu­dents who miss the national ex­am­i­na­tions?</p>
    <p>A Stu­dents who miss the national ex­am­i­na­tions with valid rea­sons can ap­ply for special con­sid­er­a­tion in the grad­ing.</p>
    <p>In award­ing a grade, SEAB will re­fer to the stu­dent’s per­for­mance in the sub­ject in the other national and school­based ex­ams, as well as the stu­dent’s rel­a­tive per­for­mance to his school­mates in the same year in the national and school­based ex­ams.</p>
    <p>Each case will be sub­jected to a rig­or­ous re­view process.</p>
