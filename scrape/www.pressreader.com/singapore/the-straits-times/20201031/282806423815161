    <p>Do not tell Mr Ed­win Tong that the Lions are “rub­bish”, for it is a com­ment that the Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth has heard many times dur­ing his pre­vi­ous ten­ure as vice-pres­i­dent of the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (FAS).</p>
    <p>“I get very up­set ac­tu­ally when they tell me the Lions are rub­bish, and I al­ways chal­lenge them to go and watch the games,” he said of the world’s 158th-ranked team.</p>
    <p>Such is his faith in Sin­ga­pore foot­ball that last Au­gust, he re­vealed to The Straits Times the FAS’ goal of get­ting the na­tional men’s foot­ball team to qual­ify for the 2034 Fifa World Cup.</p>
    <p>Praised and de­rided in turn for the lofty goal, Mr Tong said he is “happy with the con­ver­sa­tions that it has started”. He added: “I’m quite en­cour­aged by the fact that peo­ple do see it as a fo­cal point, it gal­vanises peo­ple and catal­y­ses ideas. What’s im­por­tant is for FAS to fol­low up with a more de­tailed plan.”</p>
    <p>In­for­ma­tion on train­ing pro­grammes and the dif­fer­ent devel­op­ment squads should be pro­vided to the young foot­ballers in­volved, and “mea­sur­able tar­gets” should be part of this plan, said Mr Tong.</p>
    <p>The botched project that was Goal 2010 is still fresh on many peo­ple’s minds, but Mr Tong be­lieves that Sin­ga­pore foot­ball will ben­e­fit from this new tar­get re­gard­less of whether it bears fruit in 14 years.</p>
    <p>“I can’t as­sume that it will be bet­ter than Goal 2010,” he ad­mit­ted, not­ing that Goal 2010 was “forged out of some de­gree of ad­ver­sity”.</p>
    <p>Point­ing out that the Lions did rea­son­ably well in the in­ter­ven­ing years in the SEA Games and AFF Suzuki Cup, he added: “If you com­pare where we were, be­fore Goal 2010 was an­nounced com­pared with the pe­riod nearer 2010, we were cer­tainly bet­ter than when we first an­nounced the plan, not only on the pitch but also the sup­port­ing ecosys­tem. So I would like to see at least the same kind of re­sult.”</p>
    <p>BEST IN ASEAN, FOR U-23S</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Premier League will play a role in help­ing achieve this goal, with Mr Tong not­ing the FAS’ am­bi­tion to make the Sin­ga­pore Premier League the best league in Asean to de­velop lo­cal and re­gional Un­der-23 play­ers.</p>
    <p>Th­ese SPL play­ers can then move on to ply their trades in leagues in Ja­pan, South Korea or Europe, said Mr Tong.</p>
    <p>When asked if this tar­get is a step back for the SPL given the SLeague was pre­vi­ously touted as one of the top 10 leagues in Asia, Mr Tong dis­agreed, say­ing: “If you’re able to de­velop a league, that has play­ers that can grad­u­ate into and play in the top leagues in Asia and Europe, why not?</p>
    <p>“We are able to ex­port our tal­ent and it would be good when the teams in th­ese leagues want them… that’s a big step for­ward and over time, this col­lec­tion of in­di­vid­u­als can come back into and help gal­vanise the Sin­ga­pore na­tional team and that’s how we will en­hance our team.”</p>
    <p>Na­tional Ser­vice re­mains an is­sue for male ath­letes, as Mr Tong ad­mit­ted: “There’s no ideal so­lu­tion from the sports per­spec­tive as this is a key na­tional pri­or­ity and our start­ing point is that this is some­thing all our boys must do.</p>
    <p>“But I think we have to find ways to ad­just within the sys­tem and make ex­cep­tions, when we need to.”</p>
    <p>They can look at op­tions such as en­list­ing at a younger age like the Fandi broth­ers to avoid miss­ing out on their prime years. He also sug­gested a re­vamp of FAS’ sec­ond-tier Sin­ga­pore Foot­ball League to al­low play­ers serv­ing NS to play for teams af­fil­i­ated with the mil­i­tary or po­lice as was the prac­tice when Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces and Home United fea­tured in the S-League.</p>
    <p>Both clubs have since shed their links to the uni­formed groups and are now known as the War­riors and Lion City Sailors re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>LIONS NEED YOUR SUP­PORT</p>
    <p>A life­long Manch­ester United fan who en­joys cy­cling around on his</p>
    <p>Bromp­ton bike, Mr Tong urged Sin­ga­pore­ans to give the Lions a chance.</p>
    <p>He said: “If you just look at what our new coach (Tat­suma Yoshida) has done, they’ve not done badly. And ac­tu­ally Covid has in­ter­rupted a fairly good run of form for them. So I’m qui­etly op­ti­mistic about it. It’s early days yet, but I en­cour­age Sin­ga­pore­ans to give the Lions a shot, go and watch them. You only sup­port a team when you know them.”</p>
    <p>I get very up­set ac­tu­ally when they tell me the Lions are rub­bish, and I al­ways chal­lenge them to go and watch the games.</p>
