    <p>Many bal­conies in Sin­ga­pore may be dressed up with or­na­men­tal plants and pa­tio fur­ni­ture, but at the Joe fam­ily’s Or­chard Road con­do­minium, a high-tech farm blooms.</p>
    <p>A brown tank is home to 11 ti­lapia fish, which pro­duce waste that is used to fer­tilise veg­eta­bles such as basil and per­illa.</p>
    <p>A ver­ti­cal hydroponic­s sys­tem pro­duces arugula, let­tuce, bok choy, curly kale and kai lan.</p>
    <p>The green har­vest ends up on the fam­ily’s din­ner ta­ble, thanks to 17-year-old Han­nah Joe, a stu­dent at the Sin­ga­pore Amer­i­can School.</p>
    <p>The teen’s in­ter­est in high-tech farm­ing started when she was 12. She re­calls be­ing fas­ci­nated by the sight of crops sus­pended in the air and plant-laden wa­ter­ing wheels propped up above glow­ing fish tanks at the 2015 World Expo in Mi­lan.</p>
    <p>“It made me want to set up my own aquapon­ics sys­tem at home. I re­searched for about three years, in be­tween school work,” Han­nah told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>In late 2018, she started build­ing her own aquapon­ics sys­tem from scratch at home.</p>
    <p>Her ur­ban farm­ing ef­forts come amid a na­tional push for more food to be pro­duced lo­cally, to buf­fer Sin­ga­pore – which im­ports more than 90 per cent of its food – against global food sup­ply shocks.</p>
    <p>Be­sides ef­forts to scale up largescale high-tech farms, the Re­pub­lic is also en­cour­ag­ing food grow­ing at the com­mu­nity level.</p>
    <p>In June, the Na­tional Parks Board an­nounced plans to in­crease the num­ber of com­mu­nity gar­dens, and also dis­trib­uted free pack­ets of leafy and fruit veg­etable seeds to en­cour­age peo­ple to grow ed­i­bles at home.</p>
    <p>Aquapon­ics is a sys­tem where waste pro­duced by reared fish sup­plies the nu­tri­ents for plants in a closed-loop sys­tem, while hydroponic­s is a soil-less farm­ing method where greens are grown in nu­tri­ent-rich wa­ter.</p>
    <p>When Han­nah, a Bri­tish-born South Korean who is now a Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent, set up her first aquapon­ics sys­tem in her par­ents’ bath­tub two years ago, her fish started dy­ing one by one.</p>
    <p>Af­ter do­ing more re­search, she re­alised that the fish were be­ing poi­soned by the high lev­els of am­mo­nia and ni­trates – re­leased by the fish when breath­ing and ex­cret­ing – in the tank as there were not enough plants. Af­ter a se­ries of trial and er­ror, she fi­nally achieved equilib­rium in her set-up.</p>
    <p>She moved the aquapon­ics sys­tem to the bal­cony last month.</p>
    <p>Al­though a typ­i­cal aquapon­ics sys­tem rears both veg­eta­bles and fish for food, Han­nah does not want to con­sume the fish as she is now at­tached to her new school of ti­lapia af­ter hav­ing lost the first batch.</p>
    <p>“Eat the fish? No. It’s very hard to eat ti­lapia, es­pe­cially since I rear them and spend time with them ev­ery day.”</p>
    <p>Her farm­ing has nudged the fam­ily’s monthly house­hold util­i­ties bill up by just $10, said Han­nah, who spends about 30 minutes a day check­ing on her fish and plants.</p>
    <p>Aquapon­ics and hydroponic­s use much less wa­ter com­pared with tra­di­tional farm­ing.</p>
    <p>Wa­ter is con­stantly re­cy­cled – the plants pu­rify the wa­ter as they ab­sorb dis­solved nu­tri­ents from the fish waste, while the fil­tra­tion sys­tem re­moves solid waste.</p>
    <p>The 120-litre tank needs just 10 litres to 20 litres of wa­ter a month to re­place evap­o­ra­tion loss, she said.</p>
    <p>The aquapon­ics com­po­nents – the con­tain­ers, pumps and fil­ters – cost her less than $300, while she bought the eight-rack hydroponic­s sys­tem on­line for $150, she said.</p>
    <p>Her bal­cony farm yields al­most all the leafy veg­eta­bles her fam­ily of four needs.</p>
    <p>For Han­nah, the home-grown pro­duce is ex­tra sweet. “Let­tuce salad is my favourite and it is much more ten­der, flavour­ful, less bit­ter and fresher com­pared with store­bought ones,” she said.</p>
    <p>“The veg­eta­bles smell dif­fer­ent too. I like tak­ing in the scent of the arugula as I tend to the plants.”</p>
    <p>Han­nah, who wants to pur­sue a de­gree in con­trolled-en­vi­ron­ment agri­cul­ture in univer­sity, hopes to grow rice hy­dro­pon­i­cally next.</p>
    <p>“The main thing about hydroponic­s is be­ing able to grow food in an ur­ban set­ting. If so many peo­ple eat rice, it is only nat­u­ral to ex­per­i­ment on grow­ing sta­ple foods,” she said.</p>
    <p>Food se­cu­rity ex­pert Paul Teng said ev­ery small ef­fort con­trib­utes to the coun­try’s food needs and house­holds can do their bit by grow­ing veg­eta­bles, par­tic­i­pat­ing in com­mu­nity gar­dens and re­duc­ing food waste.</p>
    <p>“As the pan­demic has shown, hav­ing your own source of veg­eta­bles also means the house­hold has some re­silience to guard against any tem­po­rary short­ages in the usual com­mer­cial sources,” he said.</p>
    <p>Last month, Han­nah do­nated hydroponic­s sys­tems to Sun­beam Place@Chil­dren’s So­ci­ety and Chen Su Lan Methodist Chil­dren’s Home to teach chil­dren about sus­tain­able agri­cul­ture and high-tech farm­ing. “The chil­dren at Sun­beam Place call the plants ba­bies and have started to love and care for them,” she said.</p>
