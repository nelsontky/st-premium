    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tish fish­er­men say Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son sold out fish stocks to the Euro­pean Union with a Brexit trade deal that gives EU boats sig­nif­i­cant ac­cess to Bri­tain’s rich fish­ing wa­ters.</p>
    <p>Some Bri­tish politi­cians also said on Satur­day that the deal added up to a sell-out.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain will leave the EU’s Com­mon Fish­eries Pol­icy on Thurs­day, but un­der the trade deal agreed on Christ­mas Eve, the cur­rent rules will re­main largely in place dur­ing a 51/ year tran­si­tion pe­riod. 2</p>
    <p>Af­ter that pe­riod, there will be an­nual con­sul­ta­tions to es­tab­lish the level of and con­di­tions for EU ac­cess to Bri­tish wa­ters.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Fed­er­a­tion of Fish­er­men’s Or­gan­i­sa­tions said the fish­ing in­dus­try had been sac­ri­ficed by Mr John­son.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, it said, Bri­tain’s share of Celtic Sea had­dock will in­crease to 20 per cent from 10 per cent, leav­ing 80 per cent in the hands of EU fleets for a fur­ther five years.</p>
    <p>“In the endgame, the Prime Min­is­ter made the call and caved in on fish, de­spite the rhetoric and as­sur­ances,” the group said.</p>
    <p>“There will, of course, be an ex­ten­sive pub­lic re­la­tions ex­er­cise to por­tray the deal as a fab­u­lous vic­tory, but it will in­evitably be seen by the fish­ing in­dus­try as a de­feat.”</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment said the trade deal re­flected Bri­tain’s new po­si­tion as a sov­er­eign in­de­pen­dent coastal state and pro­vided for a sig­nif­i­cant up­lift in quota for Bri­tish fish­ers, equal to 25 per cent of the value of the EU catch in United King­dom wa­ters.</p>
    <p>“This is worth £146 mil­lion (S$262 mil­lion) for the UK fleet, phased in over five years,” the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment said.</p>
    <p>“It ends the de­pen­dence of the UK fleet on the un­fair ‘rel­a­tive sta­bil­ity’ mech­a­nism en­shrined in the EU’s Com­mon Fish­eries Pol­icy, and in­creases the share of the to­tal catch taken in UK wa­ters taken by UK ves­sels to circa two-thirds.”</p>
    <p>But Scot­tish First Min­is­ter Ni­cola Stur­geon, the leader of the</p>
    <p>Scot­tish Na­tional Party, said Mr John­son had “sold out Scot­tish fish­ing all over again”.</p>
    <p>“Prom­ises they knew couldn’t be de­liv­ered, duly bro­ken,” Ms Stur­geon said.</p>
    <p>Fish­ing con­trib­uted just 0.03 per cent of Bri­tish eco­nomic out­put last year, but many Brexit sup­port­ers see it as a sym­bol of the re­gained sovereignt­y they say leav­ing the EU brings.</p>
    <p>Com­bined with fish and shell­fish pro­cess­ing, the sec­tor makes up 0.1 per cent of Bri­tain’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct.</p>
