    <p>Age is no de­ter­rent for two women who have be­come de­but au­thors by pub­lish­ing mem­oirs in their 90s and 70s re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Irene Lim, who re­cently turned 93, cov­ers nine decades of a Straits Chi­nese woman’s life in 90 Years In Sin­ga­pore, while Loke Loo Pin, 76, a for­mer den­tist known for act­ing on stage and tele­vi­sion, has penned Ac­ci­Den­tal Ac­tress.</p>
    <p>Lim, a house­wife, be­gan writ­ing down bits and pieces of her mem­o­ries in 1989, af­ter the death of her hus­band of 41 years. Th­ese were filed away by her daugh­ter, Univer­sity of Michi­gan pro­fes­sor Linda Lim.</p>
    <p>“This was never meant for pub­li­ca­tion, but only for the younger gen­er­a­tions of the fam­ily to know our fam­ily his­tory,” says the nona­ge­nar­ian in an e-mail in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>“When I was young, we would sit in the gar­den af­ter din­ner and ask for sto­ries about our fam­ily, and I thought it good to con­tinue this.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter she wrote in to the news­pa­pers about her­itage dishes that were dis­ap­pear­ing, she was ap­proached by his­to­rian Loh Kah Seng, who asked her to write down her mem­o­ries. Though she was daunted by the prospect at first, her daugh­ter helped her col­lect the pieces she had writ­ten over the years into a book.</p>
    <p>The book has cameos from well­known per­son­al­i­ties, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore’s found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew, sec­ond pres­i­dent Ben­jamin Sheares and OCBC banker Tan Chin Tuan.</p>
    <p>It is also full of do­mes­tic de­tails, like the process of making biji de­lima, a snack that re­sem­bles pome­gran­ate seeds, or how when she was young, she used an an­tique cab­i­net as a hen house, not re­al­is­ing it was an heir­loom.</p>
    <p>Dr Loh writes in his fore­word: “Irene’s mem­oirs, vividly and can­didly re­counted, are a key source for Sin­ga­pore’s his­tory... they can also be read for a less-known side of the Sin­ga­pore story.”</p>
    <p>Says Lim: “Writ­ing this book was to in­form my fam­ily mem­bers of how life has changed through the years.</p>
    <p>“If not for the war, with the bomb­ing and shelling, the ter­rors of the Ja­panese Oc­cu­pa­tion and Con­fronta­tion, I would not have had so many ad­ven­tures and mis­ad­ven­tures, learnt to do so many things to sur­vive as a teenager and be­come such an in­de­pen­dent per­son.”</p>
    <p>Her great­est re­gret, she says, was not be­ing able to con­tinue her ed­u­ca­tion. In con­trast, all three of her daugh­ters went to univer­sity and two have PhDs.</p>
    <p>Loke was in­spired to write her mem­oir af­ter read­ing an ar­ti­cle on jour­nalling.</p>
    <p>A re­tired den­tist, she is best known for her role as As­sis­tant Su­per­in­ten­dent Pang in 1990s lo­cal cop drama Triple Nine, though she made her TV de­but as a taxi driver’s wife in the ground-break­ing 1994 show Masters Of The Sea with just one line: “Aiyah, Ah Teck, why so late still not back yet?”. It was the first full-length English TV drama to be pro­duced in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>She also did stand-up com­edy and spent 15 years act­ing in the­atre, from Di­ary Of A Mad Woman (1997) to The Vagina Mono­logues (2008).</p>
    <p>Al­though she has been giv­ing copies of the self-pub­lished book for free to friends and fam­ily, she now hopes to sell it and do­nate the pro­ceeds to the­atre com­pany Wild Rice, whose founder Ivan Heng di­rected her in Breastis­sues (1997) and Ah Kong’s Birth­day Party (1998).</p>
    <p>The mother of two has lived with Parkin­son’s dis­ease for 16 years. “You just have to deal with it,” she says. “There’s no use moan­ing and throw­ing your life away. I told my­self, I need to fin­ish writ­ing be­fore I reach a stage when I can’t type any more.”</p>
    <p>She hopes the book will mo­ti­vate read­ers to over­come ob­sta­cles in their lives. “I want them to have the in­spi­ra­tion to do things they never thought they could do, no mat­ter how old they are or what they’re suf­fer­ing from.”</p>
