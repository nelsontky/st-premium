    </section>

    <p>We are in the midst of a dig­i­tal boom. Con­sumers have rapidly moved to on­line or mo­bile chan­nels, with the Covid-19 pan­demic speed­ing this shift. Com­pa­nies have dou­bled down on their dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tions to bet­ter in­ter­act with the newly minted di­g­er­atis.</p>
    <p>A record num­ber of dig­i­tal bank­ing trans­ac­tions are tak­ing place in the bank­ing and fi­nan­cial ser­vices sec­tor, even among se­nior cit­i­zens. Ev­ery swipe on a mo­bile de­vice or click of the mouse builds up data that or­gan­i­sa­tions can dis­til.</p>
    <p>Data is now so much more ubiq­ui­tous that some have likened it to “free air”. The up­shot?</p>
    <p>Or­gan­i­sa­tions han­dling the ter­abytes of data ac­crued have a big re­spon­si­bil­ity to the com­mu­ni­ties that drive their busi­nesses. They need to build dig­i­tal trust and shape tech­nol­ogy and big data use as an abid­ing force for good.</p>
    <p>The best time to dis­cuss re­spon­si­ble tech­nol­ogy stew­ard­ship and set­ting up guardrails around the use of big data was five years ago. The next best time is now.</p>
    <p>This re­al­ity is not lost on me and my col­leagues. Since the bank started on its dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion in 2014, we have been push­ing to­wards de­liv­er­ing greater ac­cess to in­tel­li­gent and in­tu­itive bank­ing with less has­sle and fewer wor­ries.</p>
    <p>An­other as­pect is to en­sure that the re­spon­si­ble adop­tion of tech­nol­ogy ben­e­fits all, not just some, seg­ments of so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>It will take the in­dus­try’s col­lec­tive ef­forts to en­sure that tech be­comes a pos­i­tive en­abler, pro­vid­ing real so­lu­tions to real is­sues.</p>
    <p>US­ING TECH RE­SPON­SI­BLY</p>
    <p>Thought­ful con­sid­er­a­tion of data, along with re­spect for the cus­tomer’s pri­vacy and con­sent, should be im­ple­mented from when a bank first reaches out to a cus­tomer, all the way to help­ing him make wise and re­spon­si­ble fi­nan­cial plan­ning de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial plan­ning can be overly com­pli­cated for some, even if nec­es­sary, to achiev­ing one’s fi­nan­cial goals and build­ing a nest egg. This has been am­pli­fied by the pan­demic as we found that one-third of our cus­tomers who have their salaries cred­ited to DBS or POSB ac­counts had neg­a­tive cash flow in the first six months of this year.</p>
    <p>A seam­less and in­tu­itive cus­tomer jour­ney, to­gether with big data and an­a­lyt­ics, can help to sim­plify the fi­nan­cial plan­ning process.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, un­til re­cently, ob­tain­ing a con­sol­i­dated view of one’s fi­nances, in­clud­ing hold­ings with the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) Board, would have been elu­sive.</p>
    <p>To ad­dress this, we rolled out DBS NAV Plan­ner to help users con­sol­i­date their fi­nances – from in­come, cash, CPF sav­ings and in­surance, to prop­erty, in­vest­ments, ex­penses and loans – in­clud­ing those they hold out­side of the bank. Cus­tomers also re­ceive rel­e­vant, per­son­alised in-app in­sights.</p>
    <p>To­day’s cus­tomers are cyn­i­cal and over­whelmed by the on­slaught of in­tru­sive nudges and no­ti­fi­ca­tions on their smart­phones that of­ten blur the line be­tween ben­e­fi­cial and op­por­tunis­tic. Ma­nip­u­la­tive, in­stant grat­i­fi­ca­tion mar­ket­ing only erodes cus­tomer con­fi­dence and trust.</p>
    <p>As peo­ple spend more time on­line, mer­chants without much dig­i­tal know-how might also miss out on op­por­tu­ni­ties to en­gage them.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has pro­vided an op­por­tu­nity for many fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to look be­yond their role as lenders or pay­ment/col­lec­tion plat­forms and lever­age their data an­a­lyt­ics and tech ca­pa­bil­i­ties that small busi­nesses can ac­cess in or­der to deepen cus­tomer en­gage­ment and gen­er­ate new rev­enues.</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy has made it pos­si­ble for banks and fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to use “al­ter­na­tive data” to gain a more com­plete view of the cred­it­wor­thi­ness of small com­pa­nies, po­ten­tially ex­pand­ing the pool of el­i­gi­ble bor­row­ers.</p>
    <p>Small com­pa­nies and starts-ups are more vul­ner­a­ble in a down­turn as they do not have deep pock­ets or fi­nan­cial re­serves. It is thus im­por­tant for them to have ac­cess to bank fi­nanc­ing. Dur­ing the pan­demic, across our DBS SME lend­ing busi­nesses in Sin­ga­pore and the re­gion, we were able to avail crit­i­cal work­ing cap­i­tal sup­port in dou­ble-quick time by lever­ag­ing data an­a­lyt­ics to speed up the credit doc­u­men­ta­tion process.</p>
    <p>Banks in the re­gion are also start­ing to use sim­i­lar tools to proac­tively iden­tify and ex­tend mort­gage loan mora­to­ri­ums and re­pay­ment ex­ten­sions to those af­fected by the pan­demic. Al­ter­na­tive data, when used re­spon­si­bly, can make lend­ing more in­clu­sive.</p>
    <p>ALL HANDS ON DECK</p>
    <p>Rather than sim­ply fo­cus­ing on the im­me­di­ate bot­tom line, we must take a longer-term per­spec­tive: Bring along those left be­hind by the dig­i­tal boom and close the gap for those who lack ac­cess to bank­ing ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Over the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, POSB dig­i­tal bank ac­counts were set up for 41,000 mi­grant work­ers over a week­end so they can con­tinue to re­ceive their salaries and send money home dig­i­tally.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal lit­er­acy must also be cul­ti­vated so that peo­ple are safe­guarded from the ris­ing in­ci­dence of scams, even as banks bulk up on se­cu­rity mea­sures to pre­vent, de­tect and elim­i­nate cy­berthreats.</p>
    <p>The In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity works closely with the Sin­ga­pore banks to ed­u­cate se­nior cit­i­zens on the ba­sics of dig­i­tal bank­ing as well as raise aware­ness around the threats and risks of com­mon scams.</p>
    <p>For ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) and big data to be used as a force for rapid good, while min­imis­ing mis­use, we need the in­dus­try to come to­gether to build dig­i­tal trust. In May, the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore an­nounced its Ver­i­tas “fair­ness met­rics” to help banks and non-bank lenders in­cor­po­rate AI and data an­a­lyt­ics more re­spon­si­bly.</p>
    <p>The frame­work, sched­uled to be pub­lished at the end of this year, looks at al­ter­na­tive credit risk scor­ing and con­sumer mar­ket­ing, and serves as guid­ance go­ing for­ward.</p>
    <p>This is a step in the right di­rec­tion as we work to­wards a co­her­ent and con­sis­tent guide that does not hin­der in­no­va­tion.</p>
