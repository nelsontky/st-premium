    <p>Six im­ported cases of the coro­n­avirus were con­firmed in Sin­ga­pore yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing two chil­dren, aged one and three, who re­turned from In­dia on Sept 15.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing four cases were a per­ma­nent res­i­dent and a work pass holder who had both re­turned from In­dia on Sept 16, a work pass holder from France and a work per­mit holder from the Philip­pines, said the Min­istry of Health.</p>
    <p>All six im­ported cases were serv­ing stay-home no­tices when they tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>There were also two com­mu­nity cases, both work per­mit hold­ers with Malaysian cit­i­zen­ship.</p>
    <p>One of them had gone to work at</p>
    <p>Changi Air­port.</p>
    <p>Both com­mu­nity cases were de­tected as part of rou­tine sur­veil­lance and screen­ing.</p>
    <p>There were a to­tal of 15 coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,715.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing seven of the 15 new cases.</p>
    <p>Four had been iden­ti­fied ear­lier as con­tacts of pre­vi­ous cases and were al­ready un­der quar­an­tine when they were tested.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing three cases were de­tected through sur­veil­lance test­ing.</p>
    <p>No new clus­ters and no new lo­ca­tions vis­ited by in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients were an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one case per day in the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one case per day over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 26 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,378 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the disease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 36 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>An­other 259 pa­tients are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
