    <p>• Bri­tish-French ac­tor Michael Lons­dale (right), who has a far-rang­ing film and the­atre ca­reer but is most widely recog­nised as the vil­lain op­po­site fic­tional spy James Bond in Moon­raker (1979), died on Mon­day aged 89, his agent said.</p>
    <p>Lons­dale, who was bilin­gual, chalked up more than 200 roles over a six-decade ca­reer, equally at ease i n ex­per­i­men­tal art­house pro­duc­tions as in big-bud­get crowd-pleasers.</p>
    <p>With his silky yet im­pos­ing voice and a dis­tinc­tive goa­tee, Lons­dale of­ten served up mem­o­rable per­for­mances that stuck with view­ers even when only in mi­nor roles.</p>
    <p>His agent Olivier Loiseau said he died at his home in Paris, the city where he was born on May 24, 1931, to an English mil­i­tary of­fi­cer and a French mother.</p>
    <p>Ar­guably the high­light of his ca­reer came when he played a Trap­pist monk in French film Of Gods And Men in 2010.</p>
    <p>Based on true events, the film tells the story of seven French monks who were mur­dered af­ter be­ing kid­napped from their monastery in Al­ge­ria in 1996 dur­ing the coun­try’s civil war.</p>
    <p>For the role, Lons­dale won his first and only Ce­sar award – France’s ver­sion of the Os­cars – for best sup­port­ing ac­tor in 2011.</p>
    <p>Yet for mil­lions of peo­ple, he was the sadis­tic in­dus­tri­al­ist Hugo Drax in the Bond film Moon­raker, star­ring Roger Moore, with a plan to de­stroy Earth’s pop­u­la­tion with nerve gas while he es­caped into space.</p>
    <p>Lons­dale has acted in other movies such as ac­tion film Ronin (1998), star­ring Robert De Niro and Jean Reno, and di­rec­tor Steven Spiel­berg’s his­tor­i­cal thriller Mu­nich (2005), which starred Eric Bana and Daniel Craig.</p>
