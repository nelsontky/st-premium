    <p>NEW YORK • Hol­ly­wood ac­tor Robert De Niro wants Amer­i­cans to wear face masks. So do ac­tor Mor­gan Freeman and Os­car­win­ning direc­tor Kathryn Bigelow.</p>
    <p>The Hol­ly­wood stars are fronting a cam­paign call­ing on peo­ple in the United States to cover their faces to stop the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The don­ning of masks has be­come politi­cised in the coun­try, with many Amer­i­cans re­fus­ing to wear them, fol­low­ing ini­tial con­flict­ing ad­vice about their ef­fec­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump fi­nally yielded to pres­sure and was seen wear­ing one in public last Satur­day for the first time.</p>
    <p>He was re­luc­tant to don a mask even as White House staff had tested pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
    <p>White House ex­perts lead­ing the fight against the virus have rec­om­mended wear­ing face cov­er­ings in public to pre­vent trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>As part of the Mask Up Amer­ica cam­paign, Bigelow has helped pro­duce eight 30-sec­ond tele­vi­sion ads in which dif­fer­ent ac­tors im­plore Amer­i­cans to cover their faces.</p>
    <p>Bigelow, 68, won the Os­car for Best Direc­tor for war drama The Hurt Locker (2008) and is the only woman to have won the award.</p>
    <p>“When you wear a mask, you have my re­spect. Be­cause your mask doesn’t pro­tect you, it pro­tects me,” says Freeman, 83, in one of the videos. “I wear my mask to pro­tect you... Mask up, Amer­ica.”</p>
    <p>De Niro, ac­tor Jamie Foxx and ac­tress Rosie Perez also of­fer their voices to the public ser­vice cam­paign.</p>
    <p>The cam­paign was launched by Mr An­drew Cuomo, the gov­er­nor of New York, where more than 32,000 peo­ple have died from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The virus – which has also af­fected ma­jor states such as Cal­i­for­nia, Texas and Florida – has killed more than 137,000 peo­ple and in­fected more than 3.5 mil­lion in the US.</p>
