    <p>TE­HERAN/VI­ENNA • Iran has told the United Na­tions nu­clear watch­dog that it plans to en­rich ura­nium to up to 20 per cent pu­rity, a level it achieved be­fore a 2015 ac­cord, at its For­dow site buried in­side a mountain.</p>
    <p>The move was confirmed by the head of the coun­try’s Atomic En­ergy Or­gan­i­sa­tion, Dr Ali Ak­bar Salehi, on Fri­day. It is the lat­est of sev­eral re­cent an­nounce­ments by Iran to the In­ter­na­tional Atomic En­ergy Agency (IAEA) that it plans to fur­ther breach the deal, which it started vi­o­lat­ing in 2019.</p>
    <p>That was in re­tal­i­a­tion for Wash­ing­ton’s with­drawal from the nu­clear agree­ment and its reim­po­si­tion of sanc­tions on Te­heran.</p>
    <p>The mea­sure was one of many men­tioned in a law passed by Iran’s Par­lia­ment last month in re­sponse to the killing of the coun­try’s top nu­clear sci­en­tist Mohsen Fakhrizade­h on Nov 27, which Te­heran has blamed on Is­rael.</p>
    <p>It could com­pli­cate ef­forts by US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den to re­join the deal.</p>
    <p>“Iran has in­formed the agency that in or­der to com­ply with a le­gal act re­cently passed by the coun­try’s Par­lia­ment, the Atomic En­ergy Or­gan­i­sa­tion of Iran in­tends to pro­duce low-en­riched ura­nium up to 20 per cent at the For­dow fuel en­rich­ment plant,” the IAEA said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>An IAEA re­port to mem­ber states ear­lier on Fri­day used sim­i­lar word­ing in de­scrib­ing a let­ter by Iran to the agency dated Dec 31.</p>
    <p>“Iran’s let­ter to the agency... did not say when this en­rich­ment ac­tiv­ity would take place,” the IAEA state­ment added.</p>
    <p>For­dow was built in­side a mountain, ap­par­ently to pro­tect it from aerial bom­bard­ment, and the 2015 deal does not al­low en­rich­ment there.</p>
    <p>Iran is al­ready en­rich­ing at the site with first-gen­er­a­tion IR-1 cen­trifuges.</p>
    <p>Dr Salehi said Pres­i­dent Has­san Rouhani still needs to is­sue a di­rec­tive and an “ac­tion or­der” for its of­fi­cial im­ple­men­ta­tion to be­gin.</p>
    <p>“We are soldiers and our hands are on the trig­ger. Once the chief gives the or­der, we can act very quickly,” Dr Salehi added, as cited by the semi-of­fi­cial Ira­nian Stu­dents’ News Agency.</p>
    <p>His com­ments come at a sen­si­tive time as Ira­ni­ans mark the one-year an­niver­sary of the US as­sas­si­na­tion of Gen­eral Qassem Soleimani on Jan 3 last year.</p>
    <p>The killing pushed the l ongterm foes to the brink of war, cap­ping a se­cu­rity cri­sis in the Per­sian Gulf that started when Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump aban­doned the 2015 nu­clear deal.</p>
    <p>Iran has breached the agree­ment’s 3.67 per cent limit on the pu­rity to which it can en­rich ura­nium, but it has gone up to only 4.5 per cent so far, well short of the 20 per cent it achieved be­fore the deal and the 90 per cent that is weapons-grade.</p>
    <p>The 2015 deal’s main aim was to ex­tend the time Iran would need to pro­duce enough fis­sile ma­te­rial for a nu­clear bomb, if it chose to, to at least a year from roughly two to three months.</p>
    <p>It also lifted in­ter­na­tional sanc­tions against Te­heran.</p>
    <p>US in­tel­li­gence agen­cies and the IAEA be­lieve Iran had a se­cret, co­or­di­nated nu­clear weapons pro­gramme that it halted in 2003.</p>
    <p>READY TO ACT</p>
    <p>We are soldiers and our hands are on the trig­ger. Once the chief gives the or­der, we can act very quickly.</p>
    <p>DR ALI AK­BAR SALEHI, head of Iran’s Atomic En­ergy Or­gan­i­sa­tion, on the wait for pres­i­den­tial di­rec­tive.</p>
