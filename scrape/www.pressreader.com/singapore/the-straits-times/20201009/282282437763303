    <p>NUR­BUR­GRING • Four-time For­mula One world cham­pion Se­bas­tian Vet­tel says he will leave Fer­rari with­out re­grets at the end of the sea­son, but recog­nis­ing maybe he should have steered clear of some of the fights he picked.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old Ger­man, who won his ti­tles with Red Bull, is join­ing As­ton Martin – the re­named Rac­ing Point team – next term.</p>
    <p>He leaves Fer­rari af­ter a dif­fi­cult 2019 sea­son, out-per­formed by young team­mate Charles Le­clerc, and a dis­ap­point­ing cam­paign so far with a power unit lack­ing the per­for­mance of ri­vals.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think I will go on hav­ing any re­grets, look­ing back,” Vet­tel said in an ex­ten­sive in­ter­view with F1’s Be­yond the Grid pod­cast.</p>
    <p>“It is true that I have failed be­cause I set my­self the mis­sion or the tar­get to win the cham­pi­onship with Fer­rari, I have failed; I didn’t man­age to do that.</p>
    <p>“There are things that I should have done bet­ter, things that maybe I should have seen ear­lier, fights that maybe I shouldn’t have picked,” he added, with­out seek­ing to make ex­cuses.</p>
    <p>“But then again, I think ev­ery­thing that hap­pened brought me to where I am now.”</p>
    <p>Vet­tel will be the only Ger­man rac­ing in this week­end’s Eifel Grand Prix at the Nur­bur­gring, a cir­cuit where he won with Red Bull in 2013 – the last time F1 vis­ited the track.</p>
    <p>Ques­tioned fur­ther on the fights he al­luded to, the sport’s joint-fourth most suc­cess­ful driver elab­o­rated: “I think maybe look­ing back they weren’t worth fight­ing... but then again, part of it is prob­a­bly my na­ture and it was nat­u­ral to do so, and I had a point as well in some of these lit­tle fights and bat­tles.”</p>
    <p>Vet­tel, a father of three who mar­ried his long-time part­ner Hanna Prater last year, also said he had learnt a lot in six sea­sons with Fer­rari but was look­ing for­ward to a fresh start in Eng­land.</p>
    <p>His will not be the only name that will grab at­ten­tion this week­end.</p>
    <p>Mercedes’ Lewis Hamil­ton will be seek­ing, at the sec­ond at­tempt, to equal Michael Schu­macher’s record of 91 wins while Mick, the seven-time cham­pion’s son, is set to make his F1 de­but in to­day’s open­ing prac­tice with Alfa Romeo.</p>
    <p>For­mula Two cham­pi­onship leader Schu­macher, 21, said it will be a spe­cial ex­pe­ri­ence to make his de­but on his home soil.</p>
    <p>“It looks like it’s go­ing to be wet – ev­ery time I test a new car, it’s al­ways wet! I hope I can do a few laps and do my best,” the Ger­man said.</p>
