    <p>Aus­tralia has been brac­ing it­self for po­ten­tially dev­as­tat­ing trade sanc­tions from China, leav­ing ex­porters anx­ious amid a steady de­te­ri­o­ra­tion of the ties be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>In re­cent months, China has re­stricted or de­layed im­ports of var­i­ous Aus­tralian prod­ucts, in­clud­ing beef, bar­ley and wine, in a move many con­sider to be in re­sponse to Can­berra’s call in April for an in­quiry into the ori­gins of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>China has de­nied that its mea­sures are po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated.</p>
    <p>Some Aus­tralian busi­nesses have said that they have been strug­gling re­cently to ex­port their prod­ucts to China or clear Chi­nese Cus­toms.</p>
    <p>News re­cently emerged that over A$2 mil­lion (S$1.96 mil­lion) worth of live lob­sters from Aus­tralia were sit­ting in­side tanks on planes at Shang­hai’s Pudong air­port. The ship­ments were ap­par­ently held up by de­lays in clear­ing Cus­toms, prompt­ing some Aus­tralian sell­ers to sus­pend their ex­ports to China.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the lob­ster saga, Chi­nese me­dia be­gan to re­port that seven Aus­tralian prod­ucts were to be tar­geted. Chi­nese traders were re­port­edly or­dered to stop im­port­ing wine, lob­sters, sugar, coal, cop­per ore and con­cen­trate, bar­ley and tim­ber – a move that would take a se­ri­ous toll on the Aus­tralian econ­omy. Chi­nese of­fi­cials have de­nied is­su­ing the ban.</p>
    <p>An ed­i­to­rial in the China Daily last week – head­lined “Can­berra only has it­self to blame” – said Aus­tralia had backed Washington’s ef­forts to con­tain China and will “pay tremen­dously”.</p>
    <p>“If Can­berra con­tin­ues to go out of its way to be in­im­i­cal to China… its econ­omy will only suf­fer fur­ther pain as China will have no choice but to look else­where if the re­spect nec­es­sary for co­op­er­a­tion is not forth­com­ing,” it said.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts in Aus­tralia be­lieve China did not want to ad­mit to an of­fi­cial ban on Aus­tralian goods be­cause it wanted to avoid be­ing seen as breach­ing global trade rules. In ad­di­tion, China’s un­of­fi­cial trade sanc­tions have been viewed as a form of psy­cho­log­i­cal war­fare.</p>
    <p>“They (Chi­nese of­fi­cials) leave it to you to guess,” Mr Peter Vargh­ese, a for­mer Depart­ment of For­eign Af­fairs and Trade sec­re­tary, told The Syd­ney Morn­ing Her­ald.</p>
    <p>“They let you go through the process of think­ing, ‘What could we have pos­si­bly done to up­set the Chi­nese?’ They leave us to use our imag­i­na­tions to think of what we might have done.”</p>
    <p>The new ban on the seven prod­ucts was re­port­edly due to start last Fri­day, but does not ap­pear to have yet oc­curred.</p>
    <p>Trade Min­is­ter Si­mon Birm­ing­ham this week said Aus­tralian goods were still en­ter­ing China. “The types of ru­mours sug­gest­ing an out­right blan­ket ban don’t, at this point... ap­pear to have ma­te­ri­alised. We con­tinue to see cer­tain ship­ments suc­cess­fully be­ing pro­cessed through Chi­nese Cus­toms.”</p>
    <p>But Aus­tralia has strug­gled to ad­dress the ru­mours or to mol­lify its ex­porters be­cause China has ef­fec­tively frozen high-level con­tacts.</p>
    <p>Mr Birm­ing­ham, for in­stance, has been un­able to con­tact his Chi­nese coun­ter­part.</p>
    <p>China is Aus­tralia’s largest trad­ing part­ner, ac­count­ing for over a third of all Aus­tralian ex­ports. In 2018-19, China bought A$153 bil­lion worth of Aus­tralian ex­ports.</p>
    <p>Ties be­tween China and Aus­tralia have de­te­ri­o­rated in re­cent years, es­pe­cially since Can­berra in­tro­duced laws to com­bat for­eign in­ter­fer­ence – a move widely seen as aimed at Bei­jing. Can­berra has crit­i­cised Bei­jing’s con­duct in Hong Kong, Xin­jiang and the South China Sea. Aus­tralia was also one of the first coun­tries to ban Chi­nese telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions firm Huawei from in­volve­ment in the coun­try’s 5G net­work roll-out.</p>
    <p>“Aus­tralia should know more clearly than China what it needs to do to im­prove this re­la­tion­ship,” said China’s As­sis­tant Min­is­ter of Com­merce Li Cheng­gang at a press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, ac­cord­ing to Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>Can­berra, mean­while, has been urg­ing ex­porters to di­ver­sify and look to other mar­kets be­yond China. The prob­lem for ex­porters is that China is one of few coun­tries with a grow­ing econ­omy now.</p>
