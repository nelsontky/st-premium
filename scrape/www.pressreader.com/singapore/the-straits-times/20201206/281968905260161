    <p>With only her im­me­di­ate fam­ily join­ing her for this year’s party, Ms Wee is scal­ing back on the fes­tiv­i­ties. But she still pur­chased three much smaller trees, each 40cm tall, just to add a fin­ish­ing touch to the dec­o­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>In pre­vi­ous years, Ms Melissa Sarah Wee would throw a Christ­mas party for over 30 mem­bers of her ex­tended fam­ily.</p>
    <p>But that is not pos­si­ble this year, with house­holds al­lowed only up to five vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>Still, Ms Wee has de­cided to ring in the Yule­tide sea­son prop­erly and has or­dered a Christ­mas tree.</p>
    <p>Get­ting one was not easy. Af­ter send­ing e-mails and Face­book mes­sages to four nurs­eries, the 36-year-old fi­nally struck gold – or rather, tree – with whole­sale com­pany G.G. Fresh Flower last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Ms Wee, who is the cre­ative and food op­er­a­tions team lead at cater­ing firm The Plat­ter­ing Co, had started look­ing for Christ­mas trees last month af­ter hear­ing that de­mand this year was over­whelm­ing.</p>
    <p>“My fam­ily usu­ally start our search (for a Christ­mas tree) in De­cem­ber but we heard that the trees were sell­ing out by mid-Novem­ber,” she said.</p>
    <p>In the past, her fam­ily would or­der a 2.5m-tall Christ­mas tree for the ben­e­fit of her younger cousins.</p>
    <p>“The adults would wrap presents and leave them un­der the Christ­mas tree for the chil­dren,” she said.</p>
    <p>With only her im­me­di­ate fam­ily join­ing her for this year’s party, Ms Wee is scal­ing back on the fes­tiv­i­ties. But she still pur­chased three much smaller trees, each 40cm tall, just to add a fin­ish­ing touch to the dec­o­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>She is also rustling up a feast for her im­me­di­ate fam­ily, com­plete with roast beef, oys­ters and pork crack­ling.</p>
    <p>“It’s nice to sit down and spend qual­ity time with my loved ones af­ter such a chaotic year,” she said.</p>
