    <p>•</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian state of Vic­to­ria, the epi­cen­tre of the coun­try’s coro­n­avirus out­break, will see more free­dom of move­ment as of today, af­ter months-long re­stric­tions, but re­tail­ers and restau­rants must wait longer, mak­ing some of the own­ers un­happy.</p>
    <p>Af­ter more than 100 days in a strict lock­down that al­lowed only for two hours of out­door ac­tiv­ity a day, the five mil­lion peo­ple liv­ing in Mel­bourne, Vic­to­ria’s cap­i­tal, will be able to spend as much time ex­er­cis­ing out­doors as they wish.</p>
    <p>But peo­ple must stay within 25km of their homes, Pre­mier Daniel An­drews said. Pub­lic gath­er­ings will re­main tightly lim­ited, and re­tail­ers and restau­rants must op­er­ate only on take­away or de­liv­ery or­ders, with the state gov­ern­ment eye­ing their re­open­ing by Nov 1.</p>
    <p>“I know and un­der­stand that not ev­ery­thing every­body wanted is in the an­nounce­ment I have made today,” Mr An­drews told a news con­fer­ence yes­ter­day. “I have an­nounced today what is safe.”</p>
    <p>He added: “As other parts of the world are go­ing into a deadly win­ter, with lock­downs and re­stric­tions that are heart­break­ing, (Vic­to­ria can now) build a Covid-nor­mal 2021.”</p>
    <p>The state’s re­sponse has demon­strated the ef­fec­tive­ness of tight con­trols, just as the US, UK and many other Euro­pean coun­tries weigh their pol­icy re­sponse to a sec­ond wave.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Aus­tralian In­dus­try Group, an em­ployer or­gan­i­sa­tion rep­re­sent­ing thou­sands of busi­nesses, said Vic­to­ria’s road map to re­cov­ery was a “maze that has now been turned into a long and wind­ing road”.</p>
    <p>The Busi­ness Coun­cil of Aus­tralia has also at­tacked the de­lay in the re­open­ing of re­tail and hos­pi­tal­ity. “There is no sound rea­son to con­tinue the re­stric­tions on busi­ness, es­pe­cially with case num­bers clearly on a down­ward tra­jec­tory,” coun­cil CEO Jen­nifer Wes­ta­cott said.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria, Aus­tralia’s sec­ond­most pop­u­lous state, is home to a quar­ter of its 25 mil­lion peo­ple and ac­counts for 25 per cent of eco­nomic out­put, but be­cause of the pro­longed lock­down, it makes up now 40 per cent of Aus­tralia’s ef­fec­tively un­em­ployed, ac­cord­ing to gov­ern­ment data.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son ex­pressed sym­pa­thy for the “frus­tra­tions” of busi­nesses. Mr An­drews’ La­bor Party gov­ern­ment in</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria gov­ern­ment is in op­po­si­tion to Mr Mor­ri­son’s Lib­er­als.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son said in a joint state­ment with the trea­surer and health min­is­ter that the low num­ber of new cases in the state make a “strong case for the re­tail and hos­pi­tal­ity sec­tors to re­open be­fore the next re­view date in Novem­ber”.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery day Vic­to­ria re­mains un­der re­stric­tions... comes at a heavy cost,” the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria recorded two new cases of Covid-19 yes­ter­day, keep­ing in­fec­tions be­low dou­ble dig­its for a fifth day, down from more than 700 cases a day in early Au­gust. With 816 deaths, Vic­to­ria ac­counts</p>
    <p>for more than 90 per cent of all lives lost to the coro­n­avirus in Aus­tralia this year.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has recorded just over 27,300 in­fec­tions, ac­cord­ing to health min­istry data, a frac­tion of what has been seen in some other coun­tries.</p>
