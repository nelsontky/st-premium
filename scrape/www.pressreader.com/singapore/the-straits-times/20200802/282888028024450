    <p>It is easy to for­get now but there was a time early on in the pan­demic when the price of gold was in free fall.</p>
    <p>But the pre­cious metal has since seen one of the most fe­ro­cious ral­lies ever. At the close of trad­ing in New York on July 24, bul­lion had spi­ralled to about US$1,900 an ounce, some 30 per cent higher than the low it hit in March and just 1 per cent off a record high set back in 2011.</p>
    <p>There’s the fear of fur­ther gov­ern­ment-or­dered lock­downs; and politi­cians’ de­ci­sion to push through un­prece­dented stim­u­lus pack­ages; and cen­tral bankers’ de­ci­sion to print money faster than they ever have before to fi­nance that spend­ing; and the plunge in in­fla­tion-ad­justed bond yields into neg­a­tive ter­ri­tory in the United States; and the dol­lar’s sud­den de­cline against the euro and the yen.</p>
    <p>All these things, when taken to­gether, have even trig­gered con­cern in some fi­nan­cial cir­cles that stagfla­tion – a rare com­bi­na­tion of slug­gish growth and ris­ing in­fla­tion that erodes the value of fixed-in­come in­vest­ments – could take hold across parts of the de­vel­oped world.</p>
    <p>In­vestor ex­pec­ta­tions for an­nual in­fla­tion over the next decade, as mea­sured by a bond-mar­ket met­ric known as breakevens, have moved higher the past four months after plung­ing in March. On July 24, they hit 1.5 per cent. And while that re­mains be­low pre-pan­demic lev­els and be­low the Fed­eral Re­serve’s own 2 per cent tar­get, it is nearly a full per­cent­age point higher than the 0.59 per cent yield that bench­mark 10-year Trea­sury bonds pay.</p>
    <p>The main driver be­hind gold’s lat­est rally “has been real rates that con­tinue to plum­met and don’t show signs of eas­ing any time soon”, Mr Ed­ward Moya, a senior mar­ket an­a­lyst at Oanda Corp, said. Gold is also draw­ing in­vestors “con­cerned that stagfla­tion will win out and will likely war­rant even fur­ther ac­com­mo­da­tion from the Fed”.</p>
    <p>US bond mar­kets have been a driv­ing force be­hind the rush to gold, which is serv­ing as an at­trac­tive hedge as yields on Trea­suries that strip out the ef­fects of in­fla­tion fall be­low zero. In­vestors are look­ing for safe havens that won’t lose value.</p>
    <p>The ma­nia for gold right now has trick­led down to Main Street. Re­tail in­vestors have helped put ex­change-traded fund hold­ings backed by gold on track for an 18th straight weekly gain, the long­est streak since 2006. Mean­while, gold posted its sev­enth weekly gain on July 24, and an­a­lysts don’t ex­pect the in­creases to end any time soon.</p>
    <p>“When in­ter­est rates are zero or near zero, then gold is an at­trac­tive medium to have be­cause you don’t have to worry about not get­ting in­ter­est on your gold,” Mr Mark Mo­bius, co-founder at Mo­bius Cap­i­tal Part­ners, said. “I would be buy­ing now and con­tinue to buy.”</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts have been pre­dict­ing huge up­side for gold for sev­eral months. In April, Bank of Amer­ica Corp raised its 18-month gold-price tar­get to US$3,000 an ounce.</p>
    <p>“The global pan­demic is pro­vid­ing a sus­tained boost to gold,” the bank’s head of com­modi­ties and deriva­tives re­search Fran­cisco Blanch said, cit­ing im­pacts in­clud­ing fall­ing real rates, grow­ing in­equal­ity and de­clin­ing pro­duc­tiv­ity. “More­over, as China’s GDP (gross do­mes­tic prod­uct) quickly con­verges to US lev­els, helped by the widen­ing gap in Covid-19 cases, a tec­tonic geopo­lit­i­cal shift could un­fold, fur­ther sup­port­ing the case for our US$3,000 tar­get over the next 18 months.”</p>
    <p>Bank of Amer­ica’s bold pre­dic­tion was made after gold prices ini­tially dropped in March as in­vestors sought cash to cover losses on riskier as­sets. Prices quickly re­cov­ered after a sur­prise cut to the Fed’s bench­mark rate and signs that the eco­nomic toll of the coron­avirus would lead to mas­sive stim­u­lus ef­forts from global gov­ern­ments and cen­tral banks.</p>
    <p>This isn’t the first time gold has got help from cen­tral bank stim­u­lus pro­grammes. From De­cem­ber 2008 to June 2011, the Fed bought US$2.3 tril­lion of debt and held bor­row­ing costs near 0 per cent in a bid to shore up growth, help­ing send bul­lion to a record US$1,921.17 in Septem­ber 2011.</p>
    <p>The cri­sis a decade ago was all about banks, said Mr Af­shin Nabavi, head of trad­ing at Swiss re­finer and dealer MKS PAMP Group, who now sees gold “point­ing to­wards US$2,000”. “This time, to be hon­est, I do not see the end of the tun­nel,” he said, at least un­til US elec­tions in Novem­ber.</p>
