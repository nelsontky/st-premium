    <p>Sev­eral global banks moved large sums of al­legedly il­licit funds over a pe­riod of nearly two decades, de­spite red flags over the ori­gins of the money, Buz­zFeed and other me­dia reported on Sun­day, cit­ing con­fi­den­tial doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>The me­dia re­ports were based on leaked sus­pi­cious ac­tiv­ity re­ports filed by banks and other fi­nan­cial firms with the United States Depart­ment of Trea­sury’s Fi­nan­cial Crimes En­force­ment Net­work (FinCEN).</p>
    <p>Here are the key take­aways from the re­ports:</p>
    <p>WHAT ARE</p>
    <p>THE FINCEN FILES?</p>
    <p>The in­ves­tiga­tive series is named af­ter FinCEN, which re­ceives alerts from banks and other fi­nan­cial firms about trans­ac­tions that ap­pear to be ques­tion­able. Those alerts are called sus­pi­cious ac­tiv­ity re­ports, or SARs.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions filed SARs for more than US$2 tril­lion (S$2.7 tril­lion) worth of trans­ac­tions be­tween 1999 and 2017, ac­cord­ing to the re­ports.</p>
    <p>The leaked files per­tained to roughly 2,100 SARs filed with FinCEN be­tween 2011 and 2017, rep­re­sent­ing less than 0.02 per cent of the more than 12 mil­lion SARs dur­ing that time.</p>
    <p>Among the types of trans­ac­tions high­lighted by the re­port: funds pro­cessed by JPMor­gan for po­ten­tially cor­rupt in­di­vid­u­als and com­pa­nies in Venezuela, Ukraine and Malaysia; money from a Ponzi scheme mov­ing through HSBC; and money linked to a Ukrainian bil­lion­aire pro­cessed by Deutsche Bank.</p>
    <p>WHY WOULD A TRANS­AC­TION BE DEEMED “SUS­PI­CIOUS”?</p>
    <p>US fed­eral laws re­quire cer­tain fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to file SARs if there are signs of money laun­der­ing, insider trad­ing, cy­ber at­tacks or var­i­ous types of fraud.</p>
    <p>The ex­is­tence of a re­port does not con­firm wrong­do­ing, but alerts reg­u­la­tors to pos­si­ble crim­i­nal ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Banks, money ex­changes, se­cu­ri­ties bro­kers, in­surance com­pa­nies, casi­nos and other fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions are re­quired to file SARs within 60 days of de­tec­tion, ac­cord­ing to the Trea­sury Depart­ment.</p>
    <p>WHAT WENT WRONG?</p>
    <p>US agen­cies tasked with en­forc­ing money-laun­der­ing laws rarely took any ac­tion af­ter re­ceiv­ing SARs, nor did big banks af­ter fil­ing them, ac­cord­ing to the FinCEN files.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the mil­lions of sus­pi­cious ac­tiv­ity re­ports had lit­tle to no ef­fect on polic­ing the global fi­nan­cial sys­tem, the ar­ti­cles said.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>WHAT ABOUT BANKS IN SIN­GA­PORE?</p>
    <p>A num­ber of banks here han­dled about US$4.5 bil­lion in sus­pi­cious trans­ac­tions be­tween 2000 and 2017, with DBS Bank, CIMB Bank and Deutsche Bank among those that pro­cessed the largest sums of such funds.</p>
    <p>Within that pe­riod, Sin­ga­pore re­ceived about US$3 bil­lion and sent US$1.5 bil­lion in 1,781 sus­pi­cious trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR BANKS?</p>
    <p>It is not en­tirely clear what neg­a­tive con­se­quences, if any, banks high­lighted in the FinCEN files may face.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts on Mon­day said the rev­e­la­tions were un­likely to lead to ad­di­tional reg­u­la­tory penal­ties or fines, be­cause the be­hav­iour de­tailed in the ar­ti­cles showed that the sys­tem is flawed, but did not make clear that the banks had bro­ken any rules or laws.</p>
    <p>It is pos­si­ble that some banks with dated tech­nol­ogy may have to spend more money im­prov­ing com­pli­ance sys­tems, and that politi­cians who typ­i­cally crit­i­cise the in­dus­try will scru­ti­nise the mat­ter fur­ther, but there was no im­me­di­ate sign that was hap­pen­ing yet.</p>
    <p>The Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) said on Mon­day that it is study­ing closely the in­for­ma­tion in the me­dia re­ports, and will take ap­pro­pri­ate ac­tion based on the out­come of its re­view.</p>
    <p>Al­though such sus­pi­cious trans­ac­tion re­ports do not im­ply that the trans­ac­tions are il­licit, MAS said it takes such re­ports very se­ri­ously, said a spokesman, adding that Sin­ga­pore’s reg­u­la­tory frame­work to com­bat money laun­der­ing meets in­ter­na­tional stan­dards set by the Fi­nan­cial Ac­tion Task Force.</p>
