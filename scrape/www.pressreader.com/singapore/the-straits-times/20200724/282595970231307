    <p>FRANCE • Chi­nese ac­tress Gong Li was re­cently seen out and about in France with her hus­band, French mu­si­cian JeanMichel Jarre (both right), known for his elec­tronic and new-age mu­sic.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple, who mar­ried last year af­ter two years of dat­ing, were pho­tographed on a beach in the coun­try’s south­ern re­gion.</p>
    <p>Hold­ing hands, the two, dressed in re­laxed beach­wear, were also sport­ing masks and sun­glasses.</p>
    <p>The im­ages of Gong, 55, and Jarre, 72, were di­vi­sive.</p>
    <p>Some com­mented on the sweet scene, with one ex­tolling Gong’s beauty: “Her skin is so good! It looks so del­i­cate, and she is ra­di­ant and glow­ing, even in a crowd.”</p>
    <p>Oth­ers com­mented that the cou­ple seemed very happy, with one writ­ing: “When I grow older, I also want to live like this.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, there were also brick­bats: one com­menter told her not to go back to China and an­other mocked her re­la­tion­ship with Jarre, her sec­ond hus­band.</p>
    <p>Gong Li’s per­sonal life has of­ten made head­lines.</p>
    <p>Her per­sonal and pro­fes­sional re­la­tion­ship with Chi­nese di­rec­tor Zhang Yi­mou be­tween 1987 and 1995 was highly pub­li­cised.</p>
    <p>In 1996, she mar­ried Sin­ga­porean to­bacco tycoon Ooi Hoe Seong. They di­vorced af­ter 13 years of mar­riage.</p>
    <p>Gong mar­ried Jarre last year.</p>
