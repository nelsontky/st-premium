        <p>LON­DON • The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment ur­gently called on the public to fol­low lock­down rules as a con­tin­u­ing surge in coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions pushed the num­ber of pa­tients on ven­ti­la­tors to its high­est level since last April.</p>
        <p>Home Sec­re­tary Priti Pa­tel warned that po­lice are crack­ing down on those “putting the health of the na­tion at risk by not fol­low­ing the rules” as she raised the prospect of a tougher lock­down in Eng­land in the com­ing weeks.</p>
        <p>More po­lice of­fi­cers are be­ing sent out on ded­i­cated pa­trols and have been told to is­sue fines more quickly where peo­ple are clearly breach­ing reg­u­la­tions, Mr Martin He­witt, chair­man of the Na­tional Po­lice Chiefs’ Coun­cil, told a press con­fer­ence along­side Ms Pa­tel on Tues­day even­ing.</p>
        <p>They were speak­ing as the lat­est of­fi­cial data for the United King­dom showed there were 3,363 peo­ple in me­chan­i­cal ven­ti­la­tion beds, the most since the pan­demic be­gan. There were also 1,243 new deaths from Covid-19 within 28 days of a pos­i­tive test, and 35,075 peo­ple hos­pi­talised with the disease.</p>
        <p>In a move aimed at pre­vent­ing the col­lapse of the Na­tional Health Ser­vice (NHS), thou­sands of pa­tients will be dis­charged early to ho­tels or their own homes to free up beds for coro­n­avirus suf­fer­ers re­quir­ing life-or-death care, The Guardian news­pa­per re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
        <p>Dr Vin Di­wakar, NHS med­i­cal di­rec­tor for Lon­don, said the pan­demic is the “big­gest health emer­gency this coun­try has faced since the Sec­ond World War” as he warned peo­ple to con­tinue to take the pan­demic se­ri­ously.</p>
        <p>Covid-19 is a “hor­ri­ble disease that leaves so many, in­clud­ing young peo­ple, breath­less and gasp­ing for life”, he told re­porters. If in­fec­tions keep ris­ing, the NHS in the cap­i­tal and be­yond will strug­gle to treat other con­di­tions, he said.</p>
        <p>Some non-Covid-19 pa­tients are al­ready be­ing treated at the Nightin­gale over­spill hos­pi­tal in east Lon­don, and a point will soon be reached where “more and more pa­tients from Lon­don will need to be trans­ferred else­where”, he said.</p>
        <p>Eng­land is in its third na­tional lock­down, with the public or­dered to stay at home and schools shut to most pupils. But min­is­ters have come un­der pres­sure to ex­plain why gar­den cen­tres and nurs­eries for pre-school chil­dren can re­main open, and why many peo­ple are still al­lowed to go to work.</p>
        <p>Ms Pa­tel in­sisted the mes­sage is clear and the rules are not more re­laxed than the first lock­down last spring. She did not rule out stricter lock­down mea­sures in the com­ing weeks if cases con­tinue to soar.</p>
        <p>Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son was crit­i­cised this week for ap­pear­ing to bend the lock­down rules him­self, by cy­cling at the Olympic Park in east Lon­don, 11km from his West­min­ster home.</p>
        <p>Gov­ern­ment guidelines say out­door ex­er­cise should be lim­ited and peo­ple should stay in their lo­cal area. Asked about this on Tues­day, Ms Pa­tel said peo­ple should not so­cialise and should stay away from oth­ers, “which is clearly what the Prime Min­is­ter did when he was tak­ing his daily ex­er­cise”.</p>
        <p>Mr He­witt ac­knowl­edged mis­takes have been made by po­lice en­forc­ing the rules be­cause it is an un­prece­dented sit­u­a­tion, but he said there are still too many peo­ple choos­ing not to com­ply with the reg­u­la­tions, and they are “en­dan­ger­ing us all”.</p>
        <p>He listed ex­am­ples such as a boat party in Hert­ford­shire where more than 40 peo­ple had paid £30 (S$54) each for tick­ets, and a minibus of peo­ple from dif­fer­ent house­holds go­ing from Chel­tenham, south-west Eng­land, to Wales for a walk.</p>
