    <p>Thou­sands of Thai anti-gov­ern­ment pro­test­ers yes­ter­day called for an end to coup at­tempts as months of street protests fuel ru­mours of an­other mil­i­tary takeover.</p>
    <p>The pro­test­ers de­mand the res­ig­na­tion of Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha, a for­mer junta leader who seized power in the last coup in 2014, but say they do not want him re­placed by an­other gen­eral.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers called yes­ter­day’s protest a “Re­hearsal to Op­pose a Coup”. Mr Prayut’s putsch was the 13th suc­cess­ful coup since the end of the coun­try’s ab­so­lute monar­chy in 1932.</p>
    <p>“The 14th coup will not hap­pen be­cause the peo­ple will come out and re­sist,” one of the protest lead­ers, Mr Panupong “Mike Ray­ong” Jad­nok, told the crowd.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut stayed on as prime min­is­ter after an elec­tion last year.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers say the bal­lot was rigged to keep him in power with a Con­sti­tu­tion drawn up by his for­mer gov­ern­ment that gave Par­lia­ment’s en­tire up­per house to junta ap­pointees.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut says the vote was fair. “I’m only 18 but have seen two coups al­ready. That’s not right,” said high school stu­dent Tan, who was at the protest. “We don’t want his­tory to re­peat it­self.”</p>
    <p>Both Mr Prayut and Thai­land’s army chief, Gen­eral Narong­pan Jit­tkaew­tae, this week dis­missed the pos­si­bil­ity that an­other coup was im­mi­nent – but that has only sparked fur­ther spec­u­la­tion that one could be on the cards.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment has no in­ten­tion of us­ing mar­tial law or talk about a coup,” a gov­ern­ment spokesman said.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers also ac­cuse the monar­chy of en­abling decades of mil­i­tary dom­i­na­tion.</p>
