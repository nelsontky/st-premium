    <p>The United Na­tions cur­rently pre­dicts that by 2027, In­dia will over­take China as the world’s most pop­u­lous coun­try. Es­ti­mates sug­gest In­dia and Nige­ria will to­gether add 470 mil­lion peo­ple in the next three decades – al­most a quar­ter of the world’s pop­u­la­tion in­crease to 2050.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a new study from the Univer­sity of Wash­ing­ton (UW), how­ever, sev­eral de­vel­op­ing na­tions may find their so-called de­mo­graphic div­i­dend much less of a boon than an­tic­i­pated.</p>
    <p>Pub­lished in The Lancet, the UW study has im­proved on the UN’s model by mod­el­ling fer­til­ity dif­fer­ently and mak­ing its de­cline more sen­si­tive to the avail­abil­ity of con­tra­cep­tion and the spread of ed­u­ca­tion. In many parts of In­dia, for in­stance, the to­tal fer­til­ity rate – the ex­pected av­er­age num­ber of chil­dren born to each woman – is al­ready well be­low the re­place­ment rate of 2.1 and drop­ping faster than ex­pected.</p>
    <p>The study, which also tries to ac­count for the feed­back loops be­tween ed­u­ca­tion, mor­tal­ity and mi­gra­tion, con­cludes that pop­u­la­tions around the world are go­ing to start shrink­ing sooner and faster than pro­jected.</p>
    <p>South Asia, for ex­am­ple, would have 600 mil­lion fewer peo­ple in 2100 than pre­vi­ously pre­dicted, thanks to lower-than-ex­pected lev­els of fer­til­ity.</p>
    <p>In­stead of grow­ing through­out, In­dia’s pop­u­la­tion would peak in 2050 and then de­cline to 70 per cent of that num­ber by the end of the cen­tury. By that point, China’s pop­u­la­tion would be about half its cur­rent size.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa would con­tinue to grow, with Nige­ria en­ter­ing the 22nd cen­tury as the world’s sec­ond-largest coun­try, be­hind In­dia and just ahead of China and Pak­istan.</p>
    <p>For pol­i­cy­mak­ers in In­dia and sev­eral other de­vel­op­ing na­tions, this isn’t good news. As the au­thors of the UW study point out, a shrink­ing global pop­u­la­tion has “pos­i­tive im­pli­ca­tions for the en­vi­ron­ment, climate change and food pro­duc­tion”. But it also means time is run­ning out – in­deed, may al­ready have run out – on those na­tions’ de­vel­op­ment clocks.</p>
    <p>China has been truly for­tu­nate in its de­mo­graph­ics – it peaked at the right time. Work­ing-age Chi­nese, both in to­tal num­bers and as a share of the pop­u­la­tion, crested just when world trade was most open. This made the pos­si­bil­i­ties for man­u­fac­tur­ing-led growth eas­ier to seize than they had been for cen­turies. Those coun­tries that come next – In­dia and Pak­istan, in par­tic­u­lar – will con­front a more closed world.</p>
    <p>And, worse, they now know that it is peo­ple cur­rently in the work­force, or chil­dren in school, who over their life­times will have to lift the coun­try to pros­per­ity.</p>
    <p>For coun­tries whose pop­u­la­tions will be­gin to de­cline in the 2040s, this gen­er­a­tion of work­ers and the next are all there is: They must, like their Chi­nese coun­ter­parts in the last two decades, push their coun­tries from farm to fac­tory and be­yond.</p>
    <p>Right now, In­dia’s boost­ers tout the fact that the coun­try’s work­ing-age pop­u­la­tion swells by a mil­lion peo­ple a month, pro­pel­ling eco­nomic growth. If that de­mo­graphic push runs out sooner than ex­pected, growth will de­pend on in­di­vid­ual pro­duc­tiv­ity, not sheer num­bers.</p>
    <p>That means ed­u­ca­tion and health­care and sim­i­lar “soft” in­fra­struc­ture no longer look like rich-coun­try lux­u­ries. Un­less they are put into place within the next decade, in­deed within the next few years, coun­tries such as In­dia, In­done­sia and Brazil may never be­come rich.</p>
    <p>There are other dan­gers, some of which The Lancet ar­ti­cle ges­tures at in pass­ing.</p>
    <p>It is the spread of women’s ed­u­ca­tion and women’s re­pro­duc­tive rights that is caus­ing these de­clines in fer­til­ity. Un­less women gain po­lit­i­cal clout to match, they might well end up be­ing “blamed” for the loss in na­tional power caused by a grey­ing pop­u­la­tion. Those hard-won rights might be­gin to be cur­tailed.</p>
    <p>In places with par­tic­u­larly pa­tri­ar­chal so­ci­eties, like much of South and West Asia, this is even more of a dan­ger than else­where. Even the most for­tu­nate coun­tries will need to be care­ful.</p>
    <p>By 2050, as ex­pected, China will be the world’s largest econ­omy. But the study au­thors pre­dict that, as the Chi­nese pop­u­la­tion de­clines, im­mi­gra­tion should, in the­ory, con­tinue to bol­ster Amer­ica’s work­force.</p>
    <p>The US could again be­come the world’s largest econ­omy in 2098 – if the coun­try lives up to its ideals and con­tin­ues to wel­come the world’s mi­grants. There’s no bet­ter way to en­sure Amer­ica be­comes great again.</p>
    <p>The study, which also tries to ac­count for the feed­back loops be­tween ed­u­ca­tion, mor­tal­ity and mi­gra­tion, con­cludes that pop­u­la­tions around the world are go­ing to start shrink­ing sooner and faster than pro­jected. South Asia, for ex­am­ple, would have 600 mil­lion fewer peo­ple in 2100 than pre­vi­ously pre­dicted, thanks to lower-than-ex­pected lev­els of fer­til­ity.</p>
