    <p>LON­DON • Movie fans will have the chance to get their hands on the t high-high patent leather boots worn by ac­tress Ju­lia Roberts in Pretty Woman (1990) or ac­tor Tom Cruise’s Top Gun (1986) bomber jacket when nearly 1,000 items of movie mem­o­ra­bilia go on sale in an auc­tion in De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>The arte­facts in the an­nual Prop Store En­ter­tain­ment Mem­o­ra­bilia Live Auc­tion have been hunted down by Prop Store boss Stephen Lane through his network of film­mak­ers, cast and crew mem­bers, pro­duc­tion com­pa­nies and col­lec­tors.</p>
    <p>“I started Prop Store out of my pas­sion for col­lect­ing and so it’s all about the hunt,” Mr Lane told Reuters in his com­pany’s ware­houses in Rick­mansworth, near Lon­don.</p>
    <p>“A lot of th­ese arte­facts are just thrown away at the end of pro­duc­tion or cer­tainly used to be. They were just dis­posed of or sold off. And that meant they just went to the four winds,” he said.</p>
    <p>Some of the items on this year’s list turned up un­ex­pect­edly.</p>
    <p>Mr Lane, a pas­sion­ate Star Wars fan, was vis­it­ing a crew mem­ber who had laid out his trea­sure trove of props from the sci-fi se­ries in his house. He spot­ted an­other piece of movie magic – the crys­tal ball that late singer David Bowie used in Labyrinth (1986).</p>
    <p>“We’d spent like three hours up in one room look­ing at all the Star Wars and down­stairs, and it was a piece he just didn’t think any­body was go­ing to be in­ter­ested in, and I was like ‘ that’s the cherry right there’. That’s the real ex­cite­ment of what I do,” Mr Lane said of the crys­tal ball, which is es­ti­mated to sell for £10,000 (S$17,600) to £15,000.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, more than 900 items from more than 350 films and tele­vi­sion shows will be auc­tioned in the two-day on­line sale.</p>
    <p>High­lights in­clude Obi-Wan Kenobi’s Hero Lightsabre from Star Wars: Re­venge Of The Sith (2005), es­ti­mated at £80,000 to £120,000; ac­tor Jack Ni­chol­son’s</p>
    <p>Joker’s fe­dora from t he 1989 movie Bat­man, es­ti­mated at £20,000 to £30,000, and James Bond’s MI6 train­ing suit from Sky­fall (2012), es­ti­mated at £15,000.</p>
    <p>Also on the auc­tion block are the red leather jacket worn by ac­tor Brad Pitt in Fight Club (1999), es­ti­mated at £20,000 to £30,000; Cap­tain Jack Spar­row’s hat from Pi­rates Of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011), es­ti­mated at £10,000 to £15,000, and the hel­met worn by Tom Hanks in Sav­ing Pri­vate Ryan (1998), signed by the ac­tor, his co-stars and the direc­tor Steven Spiel­berg, es­ti­mated at £10,000 to £15,000.</p>
    <p>The Top Gun bomber jacket worn by Cruise’s char­ac­ter Pete “Mav­er­ick” Mitchell is es­ti­mated at £12,000 to £16,000 and the Pretty Woman boots at £10,000 to £15,000.</p>
    <p>Among the top val­ued lots is also the com­plete cos­tume for ac­tor Keanu Reeves’ char­ac­ter Neo from the 2003 film The Ma­trix Reloaded, which is es­ti­mated at £40,000 to £60,000.</p>
    <p>The snake­skin suit worn by ac­tor Bill Nighy in Love Ac­tu­ally (2003) is es­ti­mated to sell for a more mod­est £400.</p>
    <p>The client view­ings and sale would nor­mally take place in cen­tral Lon­don but the coro­n­avirus pan­demic means most of the ac­tion this year hap­pens on­line or in the Prop Store ware­houses.</p>
    <p>Mr Lane said the pan­demic has had an un­ex­pected ef­fect on in­ter­est in movie mem­o­ra­bilia.</p>
    <p>“The amount of views on our auc­tions have been ab­so­lutely through the roof this year,” he said.</p>
    <p>“What we put that down to is the fact that peo­ple just re­ally aren’t en­ter­tain­ing. They’re not trav­el­ling, they’re not mov­ing around.”</p>
