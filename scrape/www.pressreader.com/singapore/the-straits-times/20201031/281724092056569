    <p>Af­ter 41/ years as a re­search asso</p>
    <p>2 ciate spe­cial­is­ing in 3D print­ing, Mr Gregory Chua de­cided it was time for a ca­reer change.</p>
    <p>Last month, the 32-year-old was in­tro­duced to lo­cal pre­ci­sion engi­neer­ing firm 3D Me­tal­forge and landed a job at the small and medium-sized en­ter­prise (SME) as a se­nior ad­di­tive man­u­fac­tur­ing en­gi­neer.</p>
    <p>To help him ease into his new role, the com­pany en­rolled him in a pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­gramme for ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing en­gi­neers to equip him with the tech­ni­cal skills needed.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme, which was in­tro­duced by Work­force Sin­ga­pore (WSG) in 2017 and is ad­min­is­tered by the Sin­ga­pore Pre­ci­sion Engi­neer­ing and Tech­nol­ogy As­so­ci­a­tion, equips par­tic­i­pants with skills in ar­eas such as metal-based ad­di­tive man­u­fac­tur­ing, au­to­mated sys­tem de­sign, In­ter­net of Things man­age­ment and man­u­fac­tur­ing tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The six-month pro­gramme com­prises both class­room and on-the­job train­ing.</p>
    <p>Mid-ca­reer pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMET) may go through the pro­gramme af­ter be­ing hired by par­tic­i­pat­ing com­pa­nies. Ex­ist­ing PMET em­ploy­ees who are at risk of be­ing laid off may also un­dergo the pro­gramme so that they can be re­de­ployed to take up new or en­hanced roles in the same com­pany.</p>
    <p>WSG pro­vides up to 70 per cent of fund­ing sup­port for the monthly salaries of Sin­ga­porean and per­ma­nent res­i­dent em­ploy­ees un­der the age of 40 for the du­ra­tion of the pro­gramme, capped at $4,000 a month. The sup­port in­creases to up to 90 per cent for em­ploy­ees aged 40 and above.</p>
    <p>Mr Chua said the pro­gramme so far has been use­ful. “By and large, it will help me cover all the skills gaps,” he added. While his new job is in the same field of 3D print­ing, it is still a sig­nif­i­cant tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>“There is more ap­pli­ca­tion in­volved com­pared with the safe com­fort zone of academia. I think it is very ex­cit­ing,” said Mr Chua, who has a mas­ter’s in me­chan­i­cal engi­neer­ing.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said on a visit to 3D Me­tal­forge that WSG’s job match­ing ser­vices have helped such SMEs in their hir­ing ef­forts dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, con­tribut­ing to the rise in res­i­dent em­ploy­ment in this year’s third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>At the same time, re­trench­ments con­tin­ued to climb, al­beit at a slower pace, be­cause not all com­pa­nies have been able to ex­pand their oper­a­tions like 3D Me­tal­forge, said Mrs Teo.</p>
    <p>“Re­trench­ments are some­thing that we will have to watch... be­cause the im­pact of Covid-19 is still be­ing felt,” she added.</p>
