    <p>With the Sin­ga­pore women pad­dlers hav­ing se­cured their Olympic spot, Feng Tian­wei, Yu Mengyu and Lin Ye are all play­ing in the on­go­ing T.League in Ja­pan as they catch up on their prepa­ra­tion af­ter a coro­n­avirus-hit sea­son. The pro­fes­sional ta­ble ten­nis league runs un­til Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Ta­ble Ten­nis As­so­ci­a­tion (STTA) pres­i­dent Ellen Lee knows the clock is tick­ing if her pad­dlers have any chance of cap­tur­ing an Olympic medal at next year’s Tokyo Games.</p>
    <p>It was there­fore vi­tal for the likes of Feng Tian­wei, Yu Mengyu and Lin Ye to re­turn to elite level com­pe­ti­tion as soon as pos­si­ble and Lee was pleased that the trio are in Ja­pan to com­pete in the on­go­ing T.League.</p>
    <p>The pro­fes­sional tour­na­ment, which runs un­til Fe­bru­ary, fea­tures the coun­try’s top lo­cal play­ers plus those from South Korea, Hong Kong, Ger­many, Hong Kong and Chi­nese Taipei. Feng rep­re­sents Osaka-based Nip­pon Paint Maretz, while Yu and Lin play for Nis­say Red Elf and Top Otome Ping­pongs Nagoya re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>They left for Ja­pan last month, the same month the In­ter­na­tional Ta­ble Ten­nis Fed­er­a­tion re­sumed com­pe­ti­tions af­ter sus­pend­ing events ear­lier in the year due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>On the side­lines of yes­ter­day’s Croc­o­dile Chal­lenge Cup fi­nals at the STTA head­quar­ters in Toa Payoh, Lee told The Straits Times: “The dis­rup­tion was in­evitable. It is a set­back for ev­ery­one, more so for us be­cause we are a small team and we couldn’t bring in for­eign spar­ring part­ners like we used to.</p>
    <p>“But I be­lieve our play­ers have the hunger to do their best and be com­pet­i­tive hav­ing been out of ac­tion for so long.</p>
    <p>“Our na­tional play­ers started train­ing as soon as we were al­lowed to in June, but in terms of con­di­tion, they still have to play catch up be­cause they have been train­ing and play­ing lo­cally and they need more in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>“Play­ing in Ja­pan will al­low them to im­prove at a faster rate ahead of the Olympics. That said, while we want our play­ers to be in­volved in more in­ter­na­tional events, we also have to make sure these des­ti­na­tions are safe for them to go.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s women pad­dlers have clinched three Olympic medals, a team sil­ver at the 2008 Bei­jing Games and a team bronze and sin­gles bronze (Feng) four years later in Lon­don. They re­turned empty-handed from the Rio 2016 out­ing.</p>
    <p>On the do­mes­tic front, Lee was also en­cour­aged by the suc­cess­ful stag­ing of the Croc­o­dile Chal­lenge Cup tour­na­ment. Yes­ter­day’s fi­nal was at­tended by Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong. The week-long event for pri­mary school play­ers at­tracted a record 67 schools and was the first ta­ble ten­nis event held here in the Covid-19 era. Safe man­age­ment mea­sures meant that the closed-door event ad­mit­ted only 50 peo­ple – ath­letes, of­fi­cials, and crew – on site.</p>
    <p>As coaches and par­ents were not al­lowed into the hall, the play­ers re­lied on their mo­bile phones to re­ceive coach­ing dur­ing breaks of play and um­pires wiped down all the equip­ment af­ter ev­ery match.</p>
    <p>There were ar­eas of im­prove­ment but Lee was con­fi­dent STTA had the build­ing blocks in place to stage more events next year.</p>
    <p>She said: “My staff have been put to test about how to or­gan­ise this tour­na­ment safely and with con­fi­dence. We had to change the way we do things, but they adapted very well.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause of the months of dis­use, we will have to con­duct some re­pair work for our fa­cil­ity to make sure our premises are safe. But af­ter that, we should be able to look for­ward to more com­pe­ti­tions for the juniors, se­niors and vet­er­ans.”</p>
    <p>MAK­ING UP FOR LOST TIME</p>
    <p>I be­lieve our play­ers have the hunger to do their best and be com­pet­i­tive hav­ing been out of ac­tion for so long.</p>
    <p>ELLEN LEE, STTA pres­i­dent.</p>
