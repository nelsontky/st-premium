    <p>JAKARTA • The In­done­sian gov­ern­ment is prepar­ing 75 tril­lion ru­piah (S$6.9 bil­lion) in cap­i­tal to set up a sov­er­eign wealth fund to at­tract in­vest­ments and sup­port the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Global heavy­weights from the United States to the United Arab Emi­rates have ex­pressed in­ter­est to join in.</p>
    <p>The estab­lish­ment of the sov­er­eign fund, which will be called the In­done­sia In­vest­ment Author­ity, is in­cluded in the Job Cre­ation Law.</p>
    <p>Fi­nance Min­is­ter Sri Mulyani In­drawati said 30 tril­lion ru­piah of the cap­i­tal would be in cash, while the re­main­ing would be in the form of shares of state-owned en­ter­prises and other state as­sets.</p>
    <p>The fund is aimed at at­tract­ing 225 tril­lion ru­piah in in­vest­ment, with for­eign funds from the UAE, Ja­panese con­glom­er­ate Softbank and the US In­ter­na­tional De­vel­op­ment Fi­nance Cor­po­ra­tion al­ready lin­ing up to in­vest, of­fi­cials have said pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>It re­mains un­clear where the wealth fund will be in­vested.</p>
    <p>Dr Sri Mulyani men­tioned a com­bi­na­tion of a de­vel­op­ment fund and a sta­bil­i­sa­tion fund.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials have pre­vi­ously men­tioned projects in sec­tors in­clud­ing in­fras­truc­ture, health­care, en­ergy and re­sources, tourism and tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Other sov­er­eign wealth funds else­where in­vest in fi­nan­cial mar­kets as well.</p>
    <p>“We are cur­rently for­mu­lat­ing the gov­ern­ment reg­u­la­tion as the Pres­i­dent has asked to pri­ori­tise this,” Dr Sri Mulyani told re­porters on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“We are hop­ing to get strate­gic and rep­utable part­ners so that we can de­velop the fund to bet­ter at­tract in­vest­ment.”</p>
    <p>The Job Cre­ation Law has met with wide­spread protests and crit­i­cism from labour unions and civil groups over the po­ten­tially neg­a­tive im­pact it could have on labour rights and the en­vi­ron­ment</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment, on the other hand, sees the law as a means to at­tract in­vest­ments, boost eco­nomic growth and cre­ate jobs.</p>
    <p>The wealth fund will have a su­per­vi­sory coun­cil led by the fi­nance min­is­ter, with mem­bers in­clud­ing the state-owned en­ter­prises min­is­ter and three more pro­fes­sion­als, ac­cord­ing to the law.</p>
    <p>The board of di­rec­tors will in­clude five pro­fes­sion­als to over­see the fund’s op­er­a­tion, in­clud­ing to for­mu­late the fund’s pol­icy and work plan, among other things.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment can in­ject more money into the fund should its cap­i­tal de­cline sig­nif­i­cantly, the law states.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia would fol­low t he model of the Rus­sian sov­er­eign wealth fund as it would raise the re­quired funds from pri­vate in­vestors in­stead of the coun­try’s re­serve funds, Deputy State-owned En­ter­prises Min­is­ter Kar­tika “Tiko” Wir­joat­modjo said ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>The Rus­sian Di­rect In­vest­ment Fund has in­vested and com­mit­ted 1.9 tril­lion rou­bles (S$33.5 bil­lion), of which 1.7 tril­lion rou­bles came from co-in­vestors, part­ners and banks.</p>
    <p>It has also at­tracted over US$40 bil­lion (S$54 bil­lion) in for­eign cap­i­tal into the Rus­sian econ­omy through long-term strate­gic part­ner­ships since its estab­lish­ment in 2011.</p>
    <p>Al­though the In­done­sian fund could act as al­ter­na­tive fi­nanc­ing sources to boost eco­nomic growth, the gov­ern­ment must en­sure that the fund should be trans­par­ent and in­de­pen­dent, said Per­mata Bank econ­o­mist Jo­sua Pard­ede.</p>
    <p>He told The Jakarta Post: “Both the su­per­vi­sory coun­cil and board of di­rec­tors must be in­de­pen­dent, trans­par­ent and far from po­lit­i­cal in­ter­est to mit­i­gate the risk of cor­rup­tion.”</p>
