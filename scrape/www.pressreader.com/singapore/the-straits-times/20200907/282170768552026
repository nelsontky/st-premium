    <p>It was about 6am in Gal­way, Ire­land, when Dr David Breen, chair­man of the Lung Can­cer Group of the Repub­lic of Ire­land’s Na­tional Can­cer Con­trol Pro­gramme, tes­ti­fied in the High Court in Sin­ga­pore via video­con­fer­ence on Zoom.</p>
    <p>He was ap­pear­ing as an ex­pert wit­ness for the late Noor Azlin Ab­dul Rah­man in the High Court on Aug 24 at a hear­ing to as­sess the dam­ages Changi Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal (CGH) was li­able to pay to her fam­ily for its neg­li­gence.</p>
    <p>Ms Noor Azlin died in April last year, aged 39, af­ter she had suc­ceeded in the law­suit against CGH that claimed its neg­li­gence had de­layed the de­tec­tion of her lung can­cer and led to an ad­verse med­i­cal out­come.</p>
    <p>Her es­tate is seek­ing some $6.75 mil­lion in dam­ages.</p>
    <p>Dr Breen, who is also con­sul­tant chest physi­cian at Gal­way Univer­sity Hos­pi­tals, was brought in to con­sider the ex­pert ev­i­dence of Pro­fes­sor Goh Boon Cher, who was asked to pro­vide an in­de­pen­dent ex­pert opin­ion for the hos­pi­tal by its lawyer, Se­nior Coun­sel Kuah Boon Theng.</p>
    <p>The aim was to help the court de­ter­mine what dam­ages, if any, would flow from the find­ings made in the Court of Ap­peal’s judg­ment against CGH.</p>
    <p>This in­cluded gaug­ing the im­pact</p>
    <p>or ef­fect of the pe­riod of de­lay in di­ag­no­sis re­ferred to in the Court of Ap­peal’s judg­ment on Ms Noor Azlin’s treat­ment and prog­no­sis, and whether the ef­fi­cacy of the treat­ment she re­ceived and the risk of re­lapse and ex­pected sur­vival would have been af­fected by the pe­riod of de­lay.</p>
    <p>Prof Goh, who also tes­ti­fied and had been cross-ex­am­ined be­fore Jus­tice Belinda Ang in the hear­ings spread over the past two weeks, is a se­nior con­sul­tant at the Na­tional Univer­sity Can­cer In­sti­tute, Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>A key is­sue raised at the hear­ing was whether the de­lay in the di­ag­no­sis of Ms Noor Azlin at the hospi</p>
    <p>tal had lit­tle im­pact on the out­come of her con­di­tion and the treat­ment she re­ceived.</p>
    <p>Dr Breen, in his af­fi­davit filed in March, ex­plained the “true op­por­tu­nity” of be­ing spared the grave con­se­quence for Ms Noor Azlin was not at the time of the chest X- ray per­formed in July 2011 and is­sued in Au­gust 2011 or the time lapse be­tween Au­gust and De­cem­ber 2011.</p>
    <p>“The real is­sue was the chest ra­dio­graphs per­formed in 2007 and 2010 when there was an ab­nor­mal­ity de­tected but not fur­ther acted on.</p>
    <p>“It is this pe­riod of four years that had the big­gest im­pact on the over­all out­come in this pa­tient’s</p>
    <p>clin­i­cal course.”</p>
    <p>He sug­gested that, if di­ag­nosed in 2007 or 2010, the over­all like­li­hood would be that the dis­ease would have been at an ear­lier stage, and the prog­no­sis bet­ter.</p>
    <p>At the hear­ing, he backed his point up with graphs doc­u­ment­ing that sur­vival de­creases with ev­ery in­crease in stage that a pa­tient is di­ag­nosed with.</p>
    <p>The hear­ings ended last Fri­day, and lawyers for the hos­pi­tal and Mr Vi­jay Ku­mar Rai for the es­tate will fol­low up with writ­ten sub­mis­sions to as­sist in the court’s de­ci­sion.</p>
