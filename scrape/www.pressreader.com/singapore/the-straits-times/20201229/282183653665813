    <p>Mr Chaly Mah Chee Kheong will suc­ceed Mr Liew Mun Leong as con­sul­tancy firm Sur­bana Jurong Group’s chair­man, after Mr Liew re­tired in Septem­ber amid the furore over his for­mer maid Parti Liyani’s ac­quit­tal for theft in court.</p>
    <p>Mr Mah, 64, will of­fi­cially step into his new role from Fri­day.</p>
    <p>He is cur­rently chair­man of the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board and sits on sev­eral boards in­clud­ing at the Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He was also pre­vi­ously chair­man of the Sin­ga­pore Land Author­ity and chief ex­ec­u­tive of Deloitte Asia-Pa­cific and South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Sur­bana Jurong said yes­ter­day that its board be­lieves Mr Mah’s lead­er­ship cre­den­tials will lead to growth for Sur­bana and de­liver “sus­tain­able so­cial and eco­nomic im­pact for our clients”.</p>
    <p>Mr Liew is the found­ing chair­man of Sur­bana Jurong.</p>
    <p>In step­ping down from his po­si­tion at Sur­bana Jurong, as well as his role as chair­man of Changi Airport Group, Mr Liew, 74, said he did not want his role in Ms Parti’s case “to be a dis­trac­tion to (his com­pa­nies’) re­spec­tive boards, man­age­ment and staff, amidst their many crit­i­cal pri­or­i­ties”.</p>
    <p>The High Court ac­quit­tal of his for­mer maid for theft had raised ques­tions about the mo­ti­va­tions for the po­lice re­port that was made against her, and led to a wider de­bate in Sin­ga­pore about pos­si­ble sys­temic in­equal­i­ties in its ju­di­cial sys­tem.</p>
    <p>In the state­ment, Mr Mah thanked Mr Liew for his con­tri­bu­tions and said he was “the driv­ing force be­hind Sur­bana Jurong’s growth strat­egy”.</p>
    <p>He added that he wants to make the group a global player.</p>
    <p>Sur­bana Jurong em­ploys over 16,000 peo­ple. It is head­quar­tered in Sin­ga­pore and has cre­ated a pres­ence in more than 30 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Al­though it pro­vides wider con­sul­tancy ser­vices, its work cen­tres on con­struc­tion projects, in­clud­ing homes, roads and in­dus­trial parks.</p>
