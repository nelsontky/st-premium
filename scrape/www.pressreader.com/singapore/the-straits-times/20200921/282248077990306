    <p>NUM­BER OF TRAIN­ING PLACES OF­FERED BY IN­SURER AIA SIN­GA­PORE TO GROOM TA­LENT</p>
    <p>In­surer AIA Sin­ga­pore will of­fer up to 500 train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for fresh grad­u­ates and mid-ca­reer job seek­ers hop­ing to join the in­sur­ance in­dus­try, with the op­tion to pur­sue a ca­reer in the com­pany or its fi­nan­cial ad­viser arm.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants can ac­quire soft and tech­ni­cal skills in ar­eas such as fi­nan­cial plan­ning and con­sult­ing un­der the scheme, run by AIA Sin­ga­pore and AIA Group’s flag­ship as­set man­age­ment com­pany AIA In­vest­ment Man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>El­i­gi­ble can­di­dates will re­ceive an al­lowance of $2,000 to $5,000 per month, with a bonus earned upon com­ple­tion of cer­tain train­ing mod­ules.</p>
    <p>AIA Sin­ga­pore’s newly minted chief ex­ec­u­tive Wong Sze Keed told The Straits Times that the AIA Fi­nan­cial Ca­reer Scheme 2020 will groom lo­cal ta­lent.</p>
    <p>“The pro­gramme will give them the nec­es­sary skills to kick-start their ca­reers in the fi­nan­cial sec­tor.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter the train­ing, they can con­tinue to be a fi­nan­cial ad­viser with AIA or if they want, they can eas­ily seek em­ploy­ment at other fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions,” said Ms Wong, who took the reins on July 1 and was pre­vi­ously chief dis­tri­bu­tion of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­cants who meet the re­quire­ments will be en­rolled pro­gres­sively un­til March 31.</p>
    <p>They will re­ceive struc­tured train­ing over 10 months, lead­ing to three cer­ti­fi­ca­tions: the as­so­ciate fi­nan­cial plan­ner or as­so­ciate fi­nan­cial con­sul­tant cer­ti­fi­ca­tion as part of the AIA Premier Pro­gramme, the In­sti­tute of Bank­ing and Fi­nance Pri­or­ity Bank­ing Level 1 cer­ti­fi­ca­tion, and the Foun­da­tion In­vest­ment Cer­ti­fi­ca­tion ac­cred­i­ta­tion by AIA In­vest­ment Man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Af­ter this, those who choose to re­main in the scheme can at­tend fur­ther train­ing pro­grammes based on their pref­er­ences and de­vel­op­ment needs, tak­ing their train­ing to a to­tal of two years.</p>
    <p>All can­di­dates will be as­signed a men­tor who will guide them to</p>
    <p>wards com­plet­ing the pro­gramme and hav­ing a ca­reer with AIA Sin­ga­pore or AIA Fi­nan­cial Ad­vis­ers as an AIA premier con­sul­tant.</p>
    <p>Those who are in­ter­ested can con­tact the com­pany at www.aia.com.sg/en/about-aia/ca­reers/not-just-an­other-job.html</p>
    <p>Asked about AIA’s work­force com­po­si­tion, Ms Wong noted that more than 90 per cent of its 5,000 rep­re­sen­ta­tives are cit­i­zens or per­ma­nent res­i­dents. The in­surer also has more than 1,000 staff, al­though she de­clined to say how many of them are lo­cal or for­eign.</p>
    <p>AIA Sin­ga­pore had more than</p>
    <p>one mil­lion pol­i­cy­hold­ers and man­aged $51 bil­lion in to­tal as­sets as at the end of last year.</p>
    <p>Men­tal health has been an area of fo­cus for the in­surer in re­cent years, and it is es­pe­cially rel­e­vant now as more peo­ple feel stressed and anx­ious due to the Covid-19 out­break, said Ms Wong.</p>
    <p>“The fu­ture of health is not just about go­ing out to ex­er­cise, but more im­por­tantly, mak­ing sure that we take care of our­selves men­tally.”</p>
    <p>She also noted that a na­tion­wide men­tal health study found that one in seven Sin­ga­pore­ans aged above 18 ex­pe­ri­enced a men­tal dis­or­der</p>
    <p>in his or her life­time.</p>
    <p>Last year, AIA launched Sin­ga­pore’s first in­sur­ance pol­icy that cov­ers men­tal ill­nesses. AIA Be­yond Crit­i­cal Care in­sures against five men­tal ill­nesses, such as ma­jor de­pres­sive dis­or­der, as well as crit­i­cal ill­nesses.</p>
    <p>The out­break has also forced the in­surer to un­dergo rapid dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion, noted Ms Wong.</p>
    <p>When the cir­cuit breaker started, AIA launched re­mote au­then­ti­ca­tion and sig­na­ture op­tions so that agents do not need to meet cus­tomers in per­son.</p>
    <p>To­gether with other tools to digi</p>
    <p>talise pa­per­work, this gives agents and cus­tomers a choice on how they want to meet.</p>
    <p>The com­pany also gave its more than 1,000 per­ma­nent and con­tract staff $1,000 each as part of a work-from-home as­sis­tance scheme.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong said: “Covid-19 has changed the way we work and in­ter­act with cus­tomers... There might be other chal­lenges thrown at us.</p>
    <p>“At the end of the day, we need to be highly adapt­able, look for­ward and try to fu­ture-proof our­selves.”</p>
