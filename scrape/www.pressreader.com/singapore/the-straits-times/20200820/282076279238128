    <p>A for­mer Ninja Van de­liv­ery driver, who was in debt to loan sharks, pock­eted over $18,000 in cash that he had col­lected for the com­pany.</p>
    <p>He also mis­ap­pro­pri­ated mo­bile phones, which cus­tomers of the ecom­merce de­liv­ery firm wanted to trade in, and sold them on on­line mar­ket­place Carousell.</p>
    <p>Derrick Tan Jian Sheng, 35, was jailed for eight months yes­ter­day, after plead­ing guilty to a charge of crim­i­nal breach of trust.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments stated that Tan, who is no longer with Ninja Van, started work­ing as a de­liv­ery driver for the firm in April 2018 and his du­ties in­cluded col­lect­ing cash pay­ments from cus­tomers after mak­ing de­liv­er­ies of the items or­dered.</p>
    <p>When a cus­tomer opted to trade in a mo­bile phone to off­set the pay­ment for an or­der, Tan was re­spon­si­ble for check­ing its con­di­tion be­fore col­lect­ing it.</p>
    <p>If the mo­bile phone was deemed un­ac­cept­able as a trade-in, Tan was sup­posed to col­lect cash from the cus­tomer equal to its trade-in value.</p>
    <p>He was also re­quired to hand over to Ninja Van the cash or mo­bile phones col­lected within 24 hours of mak­ing the de­liv­er­ies.</p>
    <p>Be­tween May 22 and June 11, 2018, Tan mis­ap­pro­pri­ated cash to­talling $18,555 and 16 mo­bile phones amount­ing to a to­tal tradein value of $3,850.</p>
    <p>His of­fences came to light after Ninja Van’s fi­nance depart­ment dis­cov­ered mul­ti­ple dis­crep­an­cies aris­ing from his de­liv­er­ies and in­formed his man­ager on June 8, 2018.</p>
    <p>The man­ager ar­ranged to meet</p>
    <p>Tan three days later to work out the dis­crep­an­cies and re­cover the amount un­ac­counted for. But Tan did not turn up for the meet­ing and ig­nored the man­ager’s at­tempts to reach him, Deputy Public Pros­e­cu­tor Eu­gene Teh told the district court.</p>
    <p>He was even­tu­ally traced to a ho­tel in Shen­ton Way us­ing the Global Po­si­tion­ing Sys­tem de­vice in­stalled in the com­pany van as­signed to him, the DPP said.</p>
    <p>Tan con­fessed to pock­et­ing the cash and mo­bile phones after be­ing con­fronted by the man­ager and an­other su­per­vi­sor at the ho­tel.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments stated that he used the cash to re­pay debts to loan sharks, and sold the phones on Carousell. He has made only $200 in resti­tu­tion so far.</p>
    <p>In mit­i­ga­tion, Tan’s lawyer, Ms She­hzhadee Rah­man, said that her client’s fi­nan­cial sit­u­a­tion made it im­pos­si­ble for him to com­pen­sate the com­pany fully.</p>
    <p>Urg­ing District Judge John Ng to jail Tan for eight months, DPP Teh said he mis­ap­pro­pri­ated a large sum of money over a short pe­riod of time. Tan could have been jailed for 15 years and fined for the of­fence.</p>
