    <p>The United States on Sun­day be­came the first coun­try to cross 10 mil­lion coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, as a third wave of the dis­ease surges across the na­tion. US Pres­i­den­t­elect Joe Bi­den, who spent much of his elec­tion cam­paign crit­i­cis­ing Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s han­dling of the pan­demic, was set to an­nounce a Covid-19 task force yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The daily av­er­age of re­ported new deaths in the US ac­count for one in ev­ery 11 deaths re­ported world­wide each day, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters analysis.</p>
    <p>The United States be­came the first na­tion world­wide since the pan­demic be­gan to sur­pass 10 mil­lion coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally on Sun­day, as the third wave of the Covid-19 virus surges across the na­tion.</p>
    <p>The grim mile­stone came on the same day that global coro­n­avirus cases ex­ceeded 50 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The US has re­ported about a mil­lion cases in the past 10 days, the high­est rate of in­fec­tions since the na­tion re­ported its first coro­n­avirus case in Wash­ing­ton state 293 days ago.</p>
    <p>The coun­try re­ported a record 131,420 Covid-19 cases last Satur­day and has re­ported over 100,000 daily in­fec­tions five times in the past seven days, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally.</p>
    <p>The US’ lat­est re­ported sev­en­day av­er­age of 105,600 daily cases, ramped up by at least 29 per cent, is more than the com­bined av­er­age for In­dia and France, two of the worst-af­fected coun­tries in Asia and Europe.</p>
    <p>More than 240,000 Amer­i­cans have died of Covid-19 since the dis­ease caused by the coro­n­avirus first emerged in China late last year.</p>
    <p>The daily av­er­age of re­ported new deaths in the US ac­count for one in ev­ery 11 deaths re­ported world­wide each day, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters analysis.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of re­ported deaths na­tion­wide climbed by more than 1,000 for a fifth con­sec­u­tive day last Satur­day, a trend last seen in mid-Au­gust, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den, who spent much of his elec­tion cam­paign crit­i­cis­ing Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s han­dling of the pan­demic, has pledged to make tack­ling the pan­demic a top pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den was set to an­nounce yes­ter­day a 13-mem­ber coro­n­avirus task force, com­posed largely of doc­tors and pub­lic health ex­perts, which will be led by for­mer sur­geon-gen­eral Vivek Murthy, for­mer Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion com­mis­sioner David Kessler and Yale Univer­sity pro­fes­sor of pub­lic health Mar­cella Nunez-Smith.</p>
    <p>The task force will be charged with de­vel­op­ing a blue­print for con­tain­ing the dis­ease once Mr Bi­den takes of­fice in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>“Deal­ing with the coro­n­avirus pan­demic is one of the most im­por­tant bat­tles our ad­min­is­tra­tion will face, and I will be in­formed by sci­ence and by ex­perts,” Mr Bi­den said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He has also said he would, on his first day of of­fice, re­scind Mr Trump’s de­ci­sion to freeze fund­ing and with­draw from the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO).</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, WHO chief Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus wel­comed ef­forts to strengthen the Genev­abased body through re­form and said that it was look­ing for­ward to work­ing closely with Mr Bi­den’s ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>“We wel­come any and all ef­forts to strengthen this or­gan­i­sa­tion not for its own sake, but the sake of the peo­ple we serve,” Dr Te­dros told health min­is­ters at the start of WHO’s re­sumed an­nual meet­ing.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in the US, Utah Gov­er­nor Gary Herbert de­clared late on Sun­day a new state of emer­gency to ad­dress hos­pi­tal over­crowd­ing due to a surge of coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>Utah has had 132,621 to­tal con­firmed cases and 659 deaths from Covid-19 since the pan­demic be­gan.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese changes are not shut­ting down our econ­omy, but are ab­so­lutely nec­es­sary to save lives and hos­pi­tal ca­pac­ity,” Mr Herbert said on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>The gov­er­nor said the en­tire state was be­ing placed un­der a mask man­date un­til fur­ther no­tice, and so­cial gath­er­ings lim­ited to house­hold-only for the next two weeks. All ex­tracur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­i­ties were be­ing put on hold, he said.</p>
    <p>The Mid­west re­mains the hard­est-hit re­gion based on the most cases per capita, with North Dakota, South Dakota, Wis­con­sin, Iowa and Ne­braska the top five worst-af­fected US states.</p>
