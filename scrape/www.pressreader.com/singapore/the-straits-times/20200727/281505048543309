    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Step by step, blow by blow, the United States and China are dis­man­tling decades of po­lit­i­cal, eco­nomic and so­cial en­gage­ment, set­ting the stage for a new era of con­fronta­tion shaped by the views of the most hawk­ish voices on both sides.</p>
    <p>With US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump trail­ing badly in the polls as the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion nears, his na­tional se­cu­rity of­fi­cials have in­ten­si­fied their at­tack on China in re­cent weeks, tar­get­ing its of­fi­cials, diplo­mats and ex­ec­u­tives.</p>
    <p>While the strat­egy has re­in­forced a key cam­paign mes­sage, some Amer­i­can of­fi­cials, wor­ried Mr Trump will lose, are also try­ing to en­gi­neer ir­re­versible changes, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the think­ing.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping has in­flamed the fight, brush­ing aside in­ter­na­tional con­cern about the coun­try’s ris­ing au­thor­i­tar­i­an­ism to con­sol­i­date his own po­lit­i­cal power and to crack down on ba­sic free­doms, from Xin­jiang to Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>By do­ing so, he has hard­ened at­ti­tudes in Wash­ing­ton, fu­elling a clash that at least some in China be­lieve could be danger­ous to the coun­try’s in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>The com­bined ef­fect could prove to be Mr Trump’s most con­se­quen­tial for­eign pol­icy legacy, even if it is not one he has con­sis­tently pur­sued: the en­trench­ment of a fun­da­men­tal strate­gic and ide­o­log­i­cal con­fronta­tion be­tween the world’s two largest economies.</p>
    <p>A state of broad and intense com­pe­ti­tion is the end goal of the Pres­i­dent’s hawk­ish ad­vis­ers. In their view, con­fronta­tion and co­er­cion, ag­gres­sion and an­tag­o­nism should</p>
    <p>AIM­ING FOR BROAD, SYS­TEMIC RI­VALRY</p>
    <p>Below the Pres­i­dent, Sec­re­tary Pom­peo and other mem­bers of the ad­min­is­tra­tion ap­pear to have broader goals... They want to re­ori­ent the US-China re­la­tion­ship to­wards an all-en­com­pass­ing sys­temic ri­valry that can­not be re­versed by the out­come of the up­com­ing US elec­tion... They be­lieve this re­ori­en­ta­tion is needed to put the United States on a com­pet­i­tive foot­ing against its</p>
    <p>’’ 21st-cen­tury geostrate­gic ri­val.</p>
    <p>MR RYAN HASS, a China direc­tor on former US pres­i­dent Barack Obama’s Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil who is now at the Brook­ings In­sti­tu­tion. be the sta­tus quo with the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party, no mat­ter who is lead­ing the US next year.</p>
    <p>They call it “rec­i­proc­ity”. Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo de­clared in a speech last Thurs­day that the re­la­tion­ship should be based on the prin­ci­ple of “dis­trust and ver­ify”, say­ing the diplo­matic open­ing or­ches­trated by then Pres­i­dent Richard Nixon nearly half a cen­tury ago had ul­ti­mately un­der­mined Amer­i­can in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>“We must ad­mit a hard truth that should guide us in the years and decades to come: that if we want to have a free 21st cen­tury, and not the Chi­nese cen­tury of which Xi Jin­ping dreams, the old par­a­digm of blind en­gage­ment with China sim­ply won’t get it done,” Mr Pom­peo said. “We must not con­tinue it and we must not re­turn to it.”</p>
    <p>The events of the last week brought re­la­tions to yet another l ow, accelerati­ng the down­ward spiral. Last Tues­day, the State Depart­ment or­dered China to shut down its Hous­ton con­sulate, prompt­ing diplo­mats there to burn doc­u­ments in a court­yard.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, in re­tal­i­a­tion, China or­dered the US to close its con­sulate in the south-western city of Chengdu. The Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry the next day de­nounced what it called “forced en­try” into the Hous­ton con­sulate by US law en­force­ment of­fi­cers last Fri­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>In be­tween, the Depart­ment of Jus­tice an­nounced crim­i­nal charges against four mem­bers of the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army for ly­ing about their sta­tus in or­der to op­er­ate as un­der­cover in­tel­li­gence op­er­a­tives in the US. All four have been ar­rested. This comes on top of a month in which the US ad­min­is­tra­tion an­nounced sanc­tions on se­nior Chi­nese of­fi­cials, in­clud­ing a mem­ber of the rul­ing Polit­buro, over the mass in­tern­ment of Mus­lims; re­voked the special sta­tus of Hong Kong in diplo­matic and trade re­la­tions; and de­clared that China’s vast mar­itime claims in the South China Sea were il­le­gal. The ad­min­is­tra­tion has also im­posed a travel ban on Chi­nese stu­dents at grad­u­ate level or higher with ties to mil­i­tary in­sti­tu­tions in China.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials are dis­cussing whether to do the same to mem­bers of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party and their fam­i­lies, a sweep­ing move that could put 270 mil­lion peo­ple on a black­list. “Below the Pres­i­dent, Sec­re­tary Pom­peo and other mem­bers of the ad­min­is­tra­tion ap­pear to have broader goals,” said Mr Ryan Hass, a China direc­tor on former pres­i­dent Barack Obama’s Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil who is now at the Brook­ings In­sti­tu­tion. “They want to re­ori­ent the US-China re­la­tion­ship to­wards an all-en­com­pass­ing sys­temic ri­valry that can­not be re­versed by the out­come of the up­com­ing US elec­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>“They be­lieve this re­ori­en­ta­tion is needed to put the United States on a com­pet­i­tive foot­ing against its 21stcen­tury geostrate­gic ri­val.”</p>
