    <p>With the in­crease in im­ported Covid-19 cases, trav­ellers en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore, re­gard­less of their res­i­dency sta­tus, should be quar­an­tined in ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties (Have all re­turnees serve quar­an­tine orders only at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties, by Mr Damian Ng Swee Beng, July 29).</p>
    <p>Also, they should not be al­lowed to board pub­lic trans­port from the air­port to these lo­ca­tions. More­over, tax­pay­ers should not have to bear the cost of these trav­ellers’ Covid-19 test­ing or their stay at the quar­an­tine fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>These costs should be borne by the trav­eller. The pub­lic’s safety is para­mount and should not be com­pro­mised by these trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, de­spite its small land size, has man­aged to pro­vide a rel­a­tively smooth driv­ing ex­pe­ri­ence via rel­a­tively well-main­tained and well-de­signed roads and poli­cies such as Elec­tronic Road Pric­ing.</p>
    <p>But lanes that ac­com­mo­date both ve­hi­cles that want to go straight and ve­hi­cles that want to turn right should be re­moved, es­pe­cially since many traf­fic junc­tions no longer al­low ve­hi­cles to make dis­cre­tionary right turns.</p>
    <p>I fre­quently see cars in the sec­ond-from-right lane come to a halt be­hind a car wait­ing to turn right. These cars then have to try to switch to the lane to their left.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the re­cent elec­tion cam­paign­ing and the post-elec­tion walk­a­bouts, I no­ticed that many politi­cians are fist-bump­ing mem­bers of the pub­lic. And peo­ple seem to be fist-bump­ing more in gen­eral.</p>
    <p>Fist-bump­ing should be dis­cour­aged for the same rea­sons that shak­ing hands is dis­cour­aged. It’s not un­com­mon to see peo­ple rub­bing their noses with the back of their hands or their knuck­les.</p>
    <p>If you need to make con­tact with some­one as a greet­ing, I feel that the only safe way is to bump el­bows. Other­wise, we should stick to con­tact­less forms of greet­ing oth­ers, such as the Chi­nese fist and palm salute.</p>
    <p>I ap­plaud Mr Pri­tam Singh’s de­ci­sion to set aside half of the ad­di­tional salary as Leader of Op­po­si­tion for his party, res­i­dents and other char­i­ta­ble causes (WP’s Pri­tam Singh to set aside half of pay as Leader of the Op­po­si­tion for his party, res­i­dents, or char­i­ta­ble causes, ST On­line, July 29).</p>
    <p>I be­lieve that his gen­er­ous act is not for po­lit­i­cal the­atre, and I am sure that many po­lit­i­cal of­fice-hold­ers also con­trib­ute to char­ity anony­mously.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, a unit just two floors below mine started car­ry­ing out what sounded like ma­jor ren­o­va­tions.</p>
    <p>The loud hack­ing and drilling went on for three days, and those of us at home could hardly hear one an­other.</p>
    <p>What ex­ac­er­bated the sit­u­a­tion was that one of my fam­ily mem­bers was work­ing from home (WFH). The noise made it im­pos­si­ble to fo­cus, and all of­fice work prac­ti­cally ground to a halt dur­ing those few days.</p>
    <p>The sen­tenc­ing of Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) den­tistry stu­dent Yin Zi Qin, who tried to stran­gle his for­mer girl­friend, has re­ceived much at­ten­tion and was widely dis­cussed.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore As­so­ci­a­tion of So­cial Work­ers is fa­mil­iar with such cases as we of­ten work with clients af­fected by the is­sues of vi­o­lence against women and in­ti­mate part­ner vi­o­lence, and we would like to air our views on the mat­ter</p>
    <p>PUB­LIC SAFETY IS PARA­MOUNT</p>
    <p>When I spoke to the man­ager in my man­age­ment of­fice, he du­ti­fully pro­duced the rel­e­vant es­tate by-laws, and pointed me to a no­tice in­form­ing res­i­dents about the unit’s ren­o­va­tion works. His mes­sage was clear – we had to just suf­fer in si­lence.</p>
    <p>Though cir­cuit breaker mea­sures have been re­laxed, WFH is very much en­cour­aged by the au­thor­i­ties as an ef­fec­tive mea­sure against the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Many cor­po­ra­tions still in­sist that their em­ploy­ees con­tinue to (MHA to re­view penalty frame­work in cases sim­i­lar to that of NUS stu­dent, July 22).</p>
    <p>In­ti­mate part­ner vi­o­lence must be treated very se­ri­ously, and there should be greater aware­ness of the is­sues, in­clud­ing the un­der­ly­ing fac­tors which sup­port them.</p>
    <p>There is an ur­gent need to ed­u­cate Sin­ga­pore­ans of all back­grounds and ad­dress the un­der­ly­ing at­ti­tudes that con­done vi­o­lence within the fa­mil­ial and in­ti­mate part­ner set­tings, the at­ti­tudes op­er­ate from home.</p>
    <p>Per­haps, the au­thor­i­ties could come up with an ad­vi­sory to guide ren­o­va­tion works in pri­vate es­tates to ac­com­mo­date WFH em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>While ren­o­va­tion works can­not be stopped, any­one car­ry­ing out hack­ing, drilling and other noisy works should be re­quired to take ad­di­tional noise-sup­press­ing mea­sures, such as the in­stal­la­tion of sound bar­ri­ers and other dead­en­ing ma­te­ri­als.</p>

    <p>ONLY RIGHT-MOST LANE FOR TURN­ING</p>
    <p>Ted Chia Chee Kiong</p>
    <p>GEN­ER­OUS ACT LAUD­ABLE</p>
    <p>to­wards women in our cul­ture and the ob­jec­ti­fi­ca­tion of women in our so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Also, it is cru­cial to teach con­sent and skills of emo­tional reg­u­la­tion from a young age.</p>
    <p>We urge any­one ex­pe­ri­enc­ing in­ti­mate part­ner abuse to seek help from a nearby Fam­ily Ser­vice Cen­tre or a Fam­ily Vi­o­lence Spe­cial­ist Cen­tre, to get sup­port and to help keep them­selves safe from a po­ten­tially es­ca­lat­ing sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>This may also help mit­i­gate the abuser’s vi­o­lent be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam has an­nounced that the le­gal pol­icy frame­work will be re­viewed. We urge for one that will be fair and bal­anced to peo­ple of all sta­tus. The law ex­ists to en­sure safety of all peo­ple, and to main­tain or­der.</p>
    <p>There is cer­tainly the need to fo­cus on penalty to pre­vent of­fend­ers from com­mit­ting crimes again.</p>
    <p>How­ever, re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion is just as im­por­tant, as the process of rein­te­gra­tion into so­ci­ety needs to be a smooth one to en­sure of­fend­ers can be ac­cepted after they have served their sen­tence.</p>
