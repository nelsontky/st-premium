    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • It is tough to be un­der lock­down with kids, but award­win­ning Amer­i­can ac­tress Angelina Jolie (left) shares that her six chil­dren are sup­port­ing one an­other as the fam­ily nav­i­gates stay­ing home dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, the 45-year-old ap­peared on en­ter­tain­ment tele­vi­sion pro­gramme Ex­tra to pro­mote her new Dis­ney+ film, The One And Only Ivan.</p>
    <p>She also gave up­dates on her six chil­dren, whom she co-par­ents with fel­low ac­tor and for­mer hus­band Brad Pitt. Aged be­tween 12 and 19, they are Mad­dox, Pax, Za­hara,</p>
    <p>Shiloh, and twins Knox and Vivi­enne. “They’re all to­gether and it’s a nice big bunch, so ev­ery­body’s help­ing one an­other out. We’re lucky,” said the Malef­i­cent (2014) ac­tress.</p>
    <p>She em­pha­sised the need to care for and look out for chil­dren, es­pe­cially in these un­prece­dented times.</p>
    <p>On the do­mes­tic abuse of chil­dren, she says: “There was a 40 per cent drop-off of hear­ing re­ports of abuse of chil­dren. What that means is that those like the teach­ers who recog­nise what is hap­pen­ing to the child and can re­port it can­not see the child, so do­mes­tic vi­o­lence is a big con­cern dur­ing this time.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, she adds that in times of hard­ship, “hu­man­ity al­ways comes for­ward”.</p>
    <p>She has con­tin­ued with her hu­man­i­tar­ian and phil­an­thropic ef­forts dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In March, she do­nated US$1 mil­lion (S$1.4 mil­lion) to No Kid Hun­gry, a group which seeks to end child­hood hunger in the United States. In June, she also do­nated US$200,000 to the NAACP Le­gal De­fence Fund, a civil rights or­gan­i­sa­tion and law firm ad­vo­cat­ing eq­ui­table treat­ment for peo­ple of all races.</p>
    <p>This is not the first time the Os­car win­ner has used her voice to speak out for the well-be­ing of chil­dren.</p>
    <p>In an ar­ti­cle for Time Mag­a­zine in April, Jolie spoke about safe­guard­ing chil­dren from abuse and vi­o­lence. “They may not be as sus­cep­ti­ble to the virus as other groups, but they are es­pe­cially vul­ner­a­ble to so many of the sec­ondary im­pacts of the pan­demic on so­ci­ety.”</p>
