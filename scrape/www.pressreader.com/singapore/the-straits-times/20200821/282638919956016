    <p>This gen­tly mov­ing story puts the spot­light on the ti­tle char­ac­ter, an 11-year-old girl played by Kim Ah-song (above). Bori is a coda – child of deaf adults – and is her fam­ily’s life­line in a hun­dred small ways, such as call­ing up restau­rants for home de­liv­ery noo­dles and fried chicken.</p>
    <p>Her hear­ing makes her use­ful, but ex­cludes her from the in­ti­mate bond shared by her par­ents and younger brother, who is also deaf.</p>
    <p>She tries to break into their world in a dis­qui­et­ing but oddly charm­ing man­ner. Her an­tics are mostly a means by which writer-di­rec­tor Kim Jin-yu, who grew up with a deaf mother, de­picts what life is like for a fam­ily whose mem­bers have dis­abil­i­ties in a small, tightly-knit com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>His poignant por­trayal of that life, which snagged him the Best Di­rec­tor award at the Bu­san In­ter­na­tional Film Fes­ti­val, makes a case for how peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties are ev­ery­where, if only the able-bod­ied choose to see. up by Net­flix, in­tro­duc­ing it to a wider au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>To ward off the un­wanted at­ten­tion of an­other male col­lege stu­dent, Tine (Win) de­cides to get the coolly aloof gui­tar player Sarawat (Bright) to pre­tend to be his boyfriend. After an ini­tial show of re­luc­tance, Sarawat agrees.</p>
    <p>As far as premises go, the “will you be my fake boyfriend” one is not par­tic­u­larly orig­i­nal. But, thanks to the cast, 2gether works.</p>
    <p>Tine is chirpy and some­what clue­less in the ro­mance depart­ment, de­spite his pre­vi­ous string of girl­friends, and rookie ac­tor Win brings charm and en­ergy to the role.</p>
