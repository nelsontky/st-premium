    <p>When travel be­came im­pos­si­ble and all but es­sen­tial eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity was put on hold, golfers – and busi­ness­men with time on their hands – turned their at­ten­tion to play­ing at home, driv­ing up the price of golf club mem­ber­ships.</p>
    <p>The cost went up by as much as $60,000 be­tween March last year and this month, said bro­kers, with the hefti­est hikes for the Singapore Is­land Coun­try Club (SICC) and Sen­tosa Golf Club mem­ber­ships.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to data from bro­ker Tee-Up Mar­ket­ing En­ter­prises, SICC’s mem­ber­ship, which was sell­ing at $185,000 in March last year, was go­ing for $225,000 as at last Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Over the same time pe­riod, the cost of a Sen­tosa Golf Club mem­ber­ship rose from $263,000 to $325,000.</p>
    <p>Tanah Merah Coun­try Club mem­ber­ships are also trending up at $160,000 each cur­rently, com­pared with $152,000 in March last year.</p>
    <p>Ms Fion Phua, owner of Tee-Up, said golfers, who would typ­i­cally travel to Bin­tan or Malaysia to play, were left with no choice but to head to lo­cal greens in­stead.</p>
    <p>Adding to the num­bers were for­mer golfers who re­turned to an old hobby be­cause they had fewer work and travel com­mit­ments prevent­ing them from play­ing.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness­man Ed­win Low, 51, for in­stance, whose busi­ness is based in In­done­sia, re­cently bought a mem­ber­ship at SICC for $225,000, see­ing that he would be “stuck in Singapore”.</p>
    <p>“I used to be a golfer 25 years ago but I gave it up af­ter I in­jured my back. I took it up again in Novem­ber since I can’t travel over­seas,” he said.</p>
    <p>To get back in shape, he has been golf­ing at least once to four or five times a week.</p>
    <p>Be­yond Covid-19 travel re­stric­tions, con­tin­ued in­vestor con­fi­dence in Singapore also had a role to play in in­creas­ing de­mand for golf club mem­ber­ships, bro­kers</p>
    <p>pointed out.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s han­dling of the pan­demic and the stim­u­lus pack­ages im­ple­mented to boost the econ­omy helped to in­stil con­fi­dence, which had a spillover ef­fect on de­mand for mem­ber­ships, said Ms Lee Lee Lang­dale, owner of Sin</p>
    <p>golf Ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Another fac­tor push­ing up prices is that, with more re­stric­tions im­posed by golf clubs on book­ings given the higher de­mand, some en­thu­si­asts are buy­ing mul­ti­ple mem­ber­ships to in­crease their chances of se­cur­ing a slot.</p>
    <p>Ms Made­line Choo, direc­tor of Ac­tive Golf Ser­vices, said many clubs have im­posed a limit on the num­ber of games mem­bers are al­lowed to have in a week.</p>
    <p>Some clubs changed their book­ing sys­tems to a bal­lot, which can make it frus­trat­ingly dif­fi­cult to get a tee time.</p>
    <p>Founder of a fin­tech com­pany Kelvin Chng, 43, re­cently be­came a mem­ber at Sen­tosa Golf Club and La­guna Na­tional Golf and Coun­try Club be­cause of the trou­ble he had in mak­ing book­ings, as he now plays four times a week, up from twice be­fore.</p>
    <p>His other mem­ber­ships are at SICC and War­ren Golf and Coun­try Club.</p>
    <p>“The rea­son I chose Sen­tosa was be­cause of their beau­ti­ful cham­pi­onship course, which I played sev­eral times prior to get­ting the mem­ber­ship. The staff were very friendly,” he said.</p>
    <p>As for La­guna, Mr Chng said the newly opened Dusit Thani La­guna ho­tel lo­cated on the grounds of the club and the ren­o­vated club­house were the wow fac­tors for him.</p>
    <p>PRICE STAG­NA­TION FOR SOME GOLF CLUBS</p>
    <p>For some clubs, the price rise has been more mod­est.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Sele­tar Coun­try Club mem­ber­ship was sell­ing at $49,500 in March and was at $50,000 as at last Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Ms Lang­dale said golf clubs with only one 18-hole course may be less at­trac­tive, be­ing dif­fi­cult for play­ers to se­cure book­ings.</p>
    <p>Sele­tar did not re­spond to re­quests for com­ment.</p>
    <p>A stan­dard round of golf con­sists of 18 holes, and takes around four hours to play.</p>
    <p>Larger coun­try clubs usu­ally have two to three 18-hole cour­ses avail­able for book­ing.</p>
    <p>SLIGHT IN­CREASE IN DE­MAND FOR SOCIAL CLUB MEM­BER­SHIPS</p>
    <p>Un­like golf clubs, few social clubs have seen an uptick in de­mand for their mem­ber­ships.</p>
    <p>One ex­cep­tion is The Amer­i­can Club in Clay­more Hill, which has seen its price go up from $122,000 in March last year to $128,000 last month, ac­cord­ing to Tee-Up.</p>
    <p>Prices for other clubs re­mained flat through­out last year, when social distancing mea­sures meant that many fa­cil­i­ties could not be used.</p>
    <p>Ms Phua noted that golf clubs tend to be more pop­u­lar be­cause they of­ten have the same fa­cil­i­ties as social clubs, and are seen by some as of­fer­ing more “value for money”.</p>
    <p>FU­TURE TRA­JEC­TORY FOR GOLF CLUBS</p>
    <p>At least un­til travel is al­lowed to re­sume, bro­kers and golf clubs alike are ex­pect­ing a con­tin­ued in­crease in the de­mand for mem­ber­ships.</p>
    <p>The SICC said all its op­er­a­tional cour­ses have been fully booked for the past few months, which it ex­pects to re­main the case, as its hectares of outdoor ex­panse al­low for nat­u­ral social distancing be­tween golfers.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the fate of the golf­ing in­dus­try in the longer term re­mains un­cer­tain.</p>
    <p>Ms Lang­dale said there has been a con­tin­u­ous de­cline in the num­ber of clubs, as many sites are re­de­vel­oped to meet in­fras­truc­tural de­mands.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Jurong and Raf­fles coun­try clubs “fell vic­tim” to in­fras­truc­tural de­mands for the KualaLumpu­r-Singapore high-speed rail project, which has now been can­celled.</p>
    <p>The land for Kep­pel Club and the Ma­rina Bay Golf Course – Singapore’s only 18-hole public golf course – are slated to be re­turned to the Govern­ment this year and in 2024 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>“Be­yond 2040, those clubs which man­age to get ex­ten­sions or re­newals on their lease will likely see de­mand for their mem­ber­ships in­crease sig­nif­i­cantly,” Ms Lang­dale added.</p>

        <p data-role="text">A mem&#xAD;ber&#xAD;ship at Sen&#xAD;tosa Golf Club (above), which fetched $263,000 in March last year, was priced at $325,000 as at last Tues&#xAD;day. A hefty hike was sim&#xAD;i&#xAD;larly seen at the Singapore Is&#xAD;land Coun&#xAD;try Club over the same time pe&#xAD;riod, with mem&#xAD;ber&#xAD;ship in&#xAD;creas&#xAD;ing in value from $185,000 to $225,000. Bro&#xAD;kers ex&#xAD;pect the price ap&#xAD;pre&#xAD;ci&#xAD;a&#xAD;tion to con&#xAD;tinue un&#xAD;til travel re&#xAD;stric&#xAD;tions are lifted.</p>
