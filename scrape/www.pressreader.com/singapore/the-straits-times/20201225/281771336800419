    <p>Re­tiree Lim Ee Chin had j ust watched the Na­tional Day Pa­rade on tele­vi­sion when she spot­ted her neigh­bour’s flat on fire at about 11.20pm, and in­stinc­tively knew she had to do some­thing to help.</p>
    <p>Madam Lim, 81, braved bil­low­ing smoke to fill buck­ets of wa­ter in her bath­room and drag them across the liv­ing room floor to her front gate so that her neigh­bour could douse the flames rag­ing in the Block 917 Jurong West Street 91 flat.</p>
    <p>De­spite hav­ing a curved spine and heart trou­ble, as well as pleas from her sis­ter whom she lives with to leave for her safety, Madam</p>
    <p>Lim showed no hes­i­ta­tion in help­ing a neigh­bour in se­ri­ous trou­ble.</p>
    <p>“Of course I had to help. When I saw their house burn­ing, it hurt my heart,” said Madam Lim, who used to work at a tin fac­tory. “They didn’t set the fire on pur­pose. What if they have no house to live in?”</p>
    <p>She added that she could not re­call how many pails of wa­ter she fetched on the night of Aug 9, but “it felt like an hour that would never end”.</p>
    <p>With the help of other neigh­bours, most of the fire was put out be­fore the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force (SCDF) ar­rived.</p>
    <p>Af­ter they left, Madam Lim spent the next few hours mop­ping up her flat.</p>
    <p>Her self­less ef­fort made her the old­est re­cip­i­ent of the SCDF Com­mu­nity First Re­spon­der Award, which was con­ferred on Aug 27.</p>
    <p>The award is given to mem­bers of the pub­lic who lend a hand to those in trou­ble.</p>
    <p>Madam Lim does not see her ac­tions as any­thing spe­cial.</p>
    <p>“It is just what neigh­bours do for each other, there is no need to make a big fuss over it.”</p>
