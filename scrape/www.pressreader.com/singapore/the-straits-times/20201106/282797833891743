    <p>• Vote count­ing for the United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion is still un­der way in some US states, as Amer­i­cans wait to see if Repub­li­can in­cum­bent Don­ald Trump or his Demo­cratic chal­lenger Joe Bi­den will pre­vail.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral celebri­ties in the US have also cast their votes, in­clud­ing former Hong Kong ac­tress Veron­ica Yip and her daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>Yip, 53, moved to New York and left the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try af­ter she mar­ried Chi­nese-Amer­i­can gro­cery ty­coon Jef­frey Wu in 1996. The cou­ple have one daugh­ter and two sons.</p>
    <p>Their daugh­ter Vic­to­ria Wu, 21, is voting for the first time this year and Yip told Hong Kong’s Ori­en­tal Daily News that the whole fam­ily are sup­port­ers of Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Ms Wu re­cently re­ceived on­line back­lash af­ter she posted on In­sta­gram why she would vote for Mr Trump, though she stressed that she was not can­vass­ing sup­port for him.</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing on the in­ci­dent, Yip told Ori­en­tal Daily News that her daugh­ter was not afraid of peo­ple know­ing that she voted for the Repub­li­can Party and that, in fact, she felt bet­ter af­ter voic­ing her views.</p>
    <p>“She said it was a ra­tio­nal de­ci­sion and that we should re­spect free­dom of speech re­gard­less of who we vote for,” Yip said. “Just be­cause I don’t vote for your choice doesn’t mean it is racism.”</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing why she voted for Mr Trump, she said: “Trump is a busi­ness­man who talks brashly and you may not like his style. But he re­ally does what he says, like re­duc­ing the na­tional debt pre­vi­ously and im­prov­ing the econ­omy.”</p>
    <p>The former ac­tress, known for Cat­e­gory 3 films such as Take Me and Hid­den De­sire in the early 1990s, grabbed head­lines in July af­ter her hus­band filed for bank­ruptcy and ap­plied to put three of his com­pa­nies in ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she said it did not af­fect their life­style much as they con­tin­ued to live in their lux­ury home in New York.</p>
