    <p>SEOUL • South Korean base­ball fans flocked to sta­di­ums yes­ter­day for the first time this year, happy and ex­cited even though they sat apart from rel­a­tives and friends and could not en­joy their usual beer and chicken.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s base­ball league kicked off its sea­son in May af­ter a five-week de­lay but with­out spec­ta­tors be­cause of the coronaviru­s, which has all but wiped out the global sport­ing cal­en­dar.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment last Fri­day de­cided some fans can go back, with 10 per cent of seats avail­able at Korea Base­ball Or­gan­i­sa­tion games from yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>All fans have to wear masks, have their tem­per­a­tures checked, pro­vide con­tact de­tails and main­tain so­cial dis­tance in the stands. No food or al­co­hol is al­lowed.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been com­ing to the games since 1980 and I’ve never been this thrilled to be back,” said Mr Kim Hakchul, 62, a fan of LG Twins, which played the Doosan Bears in Seoul yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“It’s sad that we can’t en­joy beer and fried chicken but that’s un­der­stand­able, and we just hope they’ll wrap up the sea­son safely.”</p>
    <p>Ms Kim Song-a, a 27-year-old Bears fan, said she had en­tered a com­pe­ti­tion to win one of the 2,424 seats up for grabs. “When I got it, I thought I must’ve used up all my luck for the year,” she said.</p>
    <p>The tick­ets sold out in 25 min­utes, a Bears of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>As the Twins’ start­ing pitcher, rookie Lee Min-ho, struck out Bears slug­gers, fans clapped and shouted his name, though the club did not bring its cheer­lead­ers.</p>
    <p>Bears out­fielder Jung Soo-bin said the re­turn of the spec­ta­tors – even under th­ese coronaviru­s con­di­tions – would give teams a boost.</p>
    <p>“Fans are our source of strength and, hope­fully, there will be more,” he said.</p>

South Korea&#x2019;s base&#xAD;ball league kicked off its sea&#xAD;son in May with&#xAD;out spec&#xAD;ta&#xAD;tors, but 10 per cent of seats at Korea Base&#xAD;ball Or&#xAD;gan&#xAD;i&#xAD;sa&#xAD;tion games were made avail&#xAD;able from yes&#xAD;ter&#xAD;day.</p>
