    <p>What are the dif­fer­ent as­pects of a suspension that can cause a car to ride badly? I just bought a two-year-old car and it is very un­com­fort­able for both the driver and pas­sen­gers. Its ride is very hard and some­times in­tol­er­a­ble over rough sur­faces. What could be the prob­lem and what can I do to get a com­fort­able ride?</p>
    <p>The first thing to check is whether the tyre pres­sures are cor­rect. Over-in­fla­tion is a com­mon cause of rough and jar­ring rides. Ex­ces­sively high tyre pres­sures re­duce the pli­ancy of the side walls, di­rectly re­duc­ing ride com­fort.</p>
    <p>Tyres are an in­te­gral part of a car’s suspension de­sign. But the con­tri­bu­tion of tyres to ride com­fort is less sig­nif­i­cant than springs and dampers. If your car’s tyre pres­sures are cor­rect, the car may have had a suspension mod­i­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Most car own­ers who mod­ify the suspension do so to en­hance han­dling. This means fit­ting springs that are stiffer and shorter, to­gether with more re­stric­tive dampers. Some ad­ven­tur­ous own­ers even re­place the rub­ber bush­ings with harder polyuretha­ne ones.</p>
    <p>All these mod­i­fi­ca­tions do not pri­ori­tise ride com­fort. The car may be highly sta­ble on a track, but on nor­mal roads which are not de­signed for rac­ing, per­for­mance sus­pen­sions will def­i­nitely de­stroy ride com­fort.</p>
    <p>Other prob­lems may arise from such mod­i­fi­ca­tions. Stiff suspension set-ups can af­fect road­hold­ing ad­versely.</p>
    <p>This is the as­pect of suspension de­sign that gives a car the abil­ity to main­tain sta­bil­ity over rough or un­even sur­faces – in other words, in real-world sit­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Poor road­hold­ing trans­lates into in­sta­bil­ity. What hap­pens is that the car will skip and hop, and the driver will strug­gle to main­tain con­trol.</p>
    <p>The un­com­fort­able ride could there­fore be a re­sult of heav­ily mod­i­fied suspension.</p>
    <p>The car may look low and cool, but on city streets, oc­cu­pants will ex­pe­ri­ence a jar­ring ride, and the driver, a hard time be­hind the wheel.</p>
