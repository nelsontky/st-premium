    <p>The Work­ers’ Party’s call for a uni­ver­sal min­i­mum wage could leave work­ers and firms worse off, with the ex­er­cise to de­ter­mine the wage level de­volv­ing into a po­lit­i­cal auc­tion, said NTUC deputy sec­re­tary­gen­eral Koh Poh Koon yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A sin­gle min­i­mum wage is not a panacea for low-wage work­ers, he added. Like all other poli­cies, there will be pros and cons, with politi­ci­sa­tion one of the big risks, he said.</p>
    <p>His re­marks come amid grow­ing dis­cus­sion on the min­i­mum wage and drew re­but­tals from WP MPs.</p>
    <p>The WP has called for a uni­ver­sal min­i­mum wage of $1,300 to be in­tro­duced across all sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Dr Koh, who is also Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Health, said that while a sin­gle min­i­mum wage is “seem­ingly a quick way to raise the wages of work­ers”, it could in­ad­ver­tently put the most vul­ner­a­ble lowwage work­ers at a dis­ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>Each sec­tor will have a dif­fer­ent pro­file of low-wage work­ers and dif­fer­ent re­al­i­ties, he said, adding that an ar­bi­trar­ily pre­scribed wage level is likely to be ei­ther not high enough to ben­e­fit all work­ers, or so high that com­pa­nies in some sec­tors pass the costs back to con­sumers, cut back on hir­ing or go un­der.</p>
    <p>Dr Koh cited Leader of the Op­po­si­tion Pri­tam Singh’s Face­book post on Mon­day that said a uni­ver­sal min­i­mum wage is a “moral im­per­a­tive” and an “act of na­tional sol­i­dar­ity”.</p>
    <p>Said Dr Koh: “In a po­lit­i­cal con­test, a po­lit­i­cal party will surely come along and say, well, $1,500 will re­flect higher ‘moral im­per­a­tives’. Yet another will come along and say $1,300 is good, $1,500 is bet­ter, but $1,700 must surely be more divine, more im­per­a­tive. It can be­come a po­lit­i­cal auc­tion.”</p>
    <p>He warned of such a process gain­ing mo­men­tum and be­com­ing de­tached from market re­al­i­ties, say­ing the min­i­mum wage would es­ca­late be­yond what firms can af­ford and im­peril the jobs of low-wage work­ers, as seen in other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“I am not so much con­cerned by what Mr Singh and the WP is propos­ing for now, but by what it por­tends for the fu­ture – the pos­si­bil­ity of a po­lit­i­cal auc­tion that will price out lower-skilled work­ers, our broth­ers and sis­ters, and dis­ad­van­tage our smaller en­ter­prises, our smaller SMEs.”</p>
    <p>While more can and should be done to help the low­est paid, he said “the cure should not be worse than the prob­lem it tries to solve”.</p>
    <p>In re­ply, Mr Singh said this could be avoided if the min­i­mum wage is set by an in­de­pen­dent panel of ex­perts, such as the Na­tional Wages Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>Bas­ing the quan­tum on sta­tis­tics such as the av­er­age house­hold ex­pen­di­ture on ba­sic ne­ces­si­ties can make the num­ber more re­al­is­tic, added the Alju­nied GRC MP.</p>
    <p>Dr Koh also asked if the min­i­mum wage should cover mi­grant work­ers and how this would be bal­anced against the “moral im­per­a­tive” to help SMEs that are strug­gling.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh said the WP’s pro­posal does not cover for­eign work­ers as they are sub­ject to other reg­u­la­tory lev­ers in­clud­ing quo­tas and levies.</p>
    <p>But the Gov­ern­ment can in­tro­duce a min­i­mum wage for Sin­ga­pore­ans first, then study the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Koh replied: “I must say it’s quite easy to pro­pose a min­i­mum wage and then when we ask questions about what it’s based on and how they will im­ple­ment it... (they) say, ‘Gov­ern­ment, go sort it out’.”</p>
    <p>Mr Singh raised a con­cern that com­pa­nies could be prof­i­teer­ing off the pro­gres­sive wage model (PWM) and asked if there were mech­a­nisms to pre­vent it.</p>
    <p>He gave the ex­am­ple of lift main­te­nance con­trac­tors at the Alju­niedHougan­g Town Coun­cil that raised their prices, cit­ing higher costs.</p>
    <p>This is be­fore the sec­tor comes un­der the PWM in 2022, he said, sug­gest­ing that some could raise prices but not pass on the in­crease to em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>“Now, if all this in­crease is go­ing to the Sin­ga­porean worker, then I’m pre­pared to take on that bur­den to per­suade our town coun­cil res­i­dents that we need to raise S&CC,” he added, re­fer­ring to ser­vice and con­ser­vancy charges.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing, Dr Koh said un­less there was col­lu­sion among the ven­dors, there would surely be a com­pany that would price its ser­vices rea­son­ably.</p>
    <p>He added he was glad Mr Singh was pre­pared to raise S&CC to jus­tify pay­ing low-wage work­ers bet­ter: “I think col­lec­tively we ought to so­cialise Sin­ga­porean con­sumers to the need to up the wages of those at the lower end and demon­strate so­cial sol­i­dar­ity.”</p>
    <p>A VERY SMALL NUM­BER</p>
    <p>With Work­fare and em­ployer’s CPF con­tri­bu­tion in­cluded, only about 56,000 across a va­ri­ety of job roles earn less than $1,300. Of these, only about 32,000 are full-time em­ploy­ees... This is a very small num­ber... about 1.7% of our lo­cal work­force.</p>
    <p>DR KOH POH KOON, NTUC deputy sec­re­tary-gen­eral.</p>
    <p>NOT AC­CEPT­ABLE</p>
    <p>I’ll be pre­pared to work with the Se­nior Min­is­ter of State to en­sure that we can ac­tu­ally reach out to these Sin­ga­pore­ans as quickly as the Gov­ern­ment can, be­cause I don’t think it is ac­cept­able that any­one, any Sin­ga­porean, is earn­ing be­low this num­ber.</p>
    <p>MR PRI­TAM SINGH, Leader of the Op­po­si­tion, on Sin­ga­porean work­ers tak­ing home less than $1,300 a month.</p>
