    <p>LON­DON • Formula One world cham­pion Lewis Hamil­ton has said he was “mis­in­ter­preted” af­ter shar­ing a post on so­cial me­dia that ac­cused Bill Gates of ly­ing about a Covid-19 vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton said he wanted to “clar­ify (his) thoughts” on the is­sue af­ter the video posted to his 18.3 mil­lion In­sta­gram fol­low­ers at­tracted crit­i­cal com­ments. The post has since been deleted.</p>
    <p>In the footage, Gates, the bil­lion­aire phi­lan­thropist who has pledged US$250 mil­lion (S$345.4 mil­lion) to fight­ing the coro­n­avirus, is ques­tioned about the pos­si­ble side ef­fects of a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>A com­ment ac­com­pa­ny­ing the orig­i­nal post ac­cuses Gates of telling lies – some­thing that Hamil­ton said he failed to spot.</p>
    <p>“I’ve no­ticed some com­ments on my ear­lier post around the coro­n­avirus vac­cine, and want to clar­ify my thoughts on it, as I un­der­stand why they might have been mis­in­ter­preted,” the 35-year-old Mercedes driver wrote in a sub­se­quent post on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>“Firstly, I hadn’t ac­tu­ally seen the com­ment at­tached so that is to­tally my fault and I have a lot of re­spect for the char­ity work Bill Gates does.</p>
    <p>“I also want to be clear that I’m not against a vac­cine and no doubt it will be im­por­tant in the fight against coro­n­avirus, and I’m hope­ful for its devel­op­ment to help save lives.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Bri­ton said the video showed “there is still a lot of un­cer­tainty about the side ef­fects (of a vac­cine) and how it is go­ing to be funded”.</p>
    <p>Last week Gates was forced to deny con­spir­acy the­o­ries ac­cus­ing him of cre­at­ing the coro­n­avirus out­break, for rea­sons vary­ing from bi­o­log­i­cal ter­ror­ism to mak­ing money from sell­ing vac­cines.</p>
    <p>A video al­leg­ing Gates wanted “to elim­i­nate 15 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion” through vac­cines and elec­tronic mi­crochips has racked up mil­lions of views on YouTube.</p>
    <p>“It’s a bad com­bi­na­tion of pan­demic and so­cial me­dia and peo­ple look­ing for a very sim­ple ex­pla­na­tion,” the Mi­crosoft founder said dur­ing a CNN Town Hall in­ter­view.</p>
