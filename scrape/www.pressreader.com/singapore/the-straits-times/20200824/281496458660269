    <p>The Straits Times launches its first vir­tual run to­day, with the event re­plac­ing the tra­di­tional ST Run that at­tracts more than 13,000 run­ners an­nu­ally.</p>
    <p>Un­like mass par­tic­i­pa­tion runs which see thou­sands gath­er­ing in one place be­fore pound­ing the streets, The ST Vir­tual Run (STVR) al­lows par­tic­i­pants to run a race at their own pace and in their own space. Run­ners are also al­lowed to record their dis­tances over sev­eral ses­sions.</p>
    <p>To mark this news­pa­per’s 175th an­niver­sary, there will be two cat­e­gories at the STVR – 17.5km and 175km. Par­tic­i­pants will have 10 days to com­plete 17.5km, and 60 days for the 175km dis­tance.</p>
    <p>ST sports edi­tor Lee Yulin, who is also chair­man of STVR, said: “The Covid-19 pan­demic has dis­rupted our lives in a way that was pre­vi­ously unimag­in­able.</p>
    <p>“But life must carry on, and we are pleased to be able to put on The ST Vir­tual Run be­cause it al­lows us to en­gage the run­ning com­mu­nity in a man­ner that is safe for our par­tic­i­pants, spon­sors and part­ners.</p>
    <p>“The beauty of a vir­tual run lies in its flex­i­bil­ity, which makes it ideal for busy in­di­vid­u­als. Be­sides be­ing able to de­ter­mine when and where you run, you can also de­cide how chal­leng­ing you want the ex­pe­ri­ence to be by ei­ther clocking longer dis­tances at one go or break­ing up the ef­fort into bite-sized pieces.”</p>
    <p>The race pe­riod for the 17.5km run is Oct 9 to 18, while that for the 175km is Oct 19 to Dec 17.</p>
    <p>En­try fees for past par­tic­i­pants of the ST Run are $15 (17.5km) and $20 (175km). Early bird prices are $18 and $23, re­spec­tively, till Sept 11. Nor­mal rates are $22 and $27.</p>
    <p>Reg­is­tra­tion closes at 11.59pm on Oct 4. Those in­ter­ested can sign up at www.strait­stimes­run.com</p>
    <p>Mr Philip Chua, di­rec­tor of pre­sent­ing spon­sor Panasonic Singapore, en­cour­aged par­tic­i­pants to sign up, say­ing: “Un­for­tu­nately, due to the cur­rent Covid-19 pan­demic, large-scale events will have to be avoided. How­ever, keep­ing a healthy mind and life­style re­mains equally im­por­tant for our na­tion to ride through this pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We would like to en­cour­age ev­ery­one to par­tic­i­pate in this ini­tia­tive where we bring the joy of run­ning to the com­mu­nity with­out com­pro­mis­ing their safety. Through dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, par­tic­i­pants can con­nect and en­cour­age one an­other to keep mov­ing and stay healthy.”</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ous ST Run par­tic­i­pants wel­comed the news of the event go­ing vir­tual, with Dr Gwen Lim, 39, say­ing: “It is go­ing to be quite a good ex­pe­ri­ence be­cause we are all still run­ning. So, even though we can’t run to­gether in big groups any more, it still doesn’t take away that passion of want­ing to join a race. This is one of the ar­eas where we have to im­pro­vise dur­ing this pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>Fel­low run­ner Jared Dougherty, AT&T and Warn­erMe­dia’s head of ex­ter­nal and reg­u­la­tory af­fairs (Asia), noted that the com­mu­nity el­e­ment of the event would still re­main de­spite the run be­ing a vir­tual one.</p>
    <p>The 49-year-old added: “The train­ing and plan­ning how to get there and where to eat with your friends (af­ter the run) is part of the ex­pe­ri­ence. Now, I think peo­ple are go­ing to find new ways – they will be i n touch through What­sApp groups and ask­ing things like, ‘How far along are you in your 175km?’</p>
    <p>“It still in one way gives you a com­mon ex­pe­ri­ence to talk about and plan for, even if you are not go­ing to do it to­gether.”</p>
    <p>Race fin­ish­ers will re­ceive a New Bal­ance Dry tee worth $49.</p>
    <p>Last year, the ST Run an­nounced a unique three-piece medal for par­tic­i­pants, which when joined to­gether, would form an im­age of the city’s iconic land­scape. The first piece was awarded to race fin­ish­ers last year. This year, those who com­plete the 17.5km event will re­ceive the sec­ond part of the medal, while those who go the full 175km dis­tance will get both the sec­ond and third pieces.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to the en­ti­tle­ments, those who sign up also stand a chance to win prizes from spon­sors via so­cial me­dia con­tests.</p>
