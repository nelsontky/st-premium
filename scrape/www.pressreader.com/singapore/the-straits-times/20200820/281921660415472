    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US Democrats have for­mally nom­i­nated Mr Joe Bi­den for the pres­i­dency, anoint­ing him as their stan­dard-bearer against Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>This fol­lowed an ex­tra­or­di­nary vir­tual roll call vote that show­cased the cul­tural di­ver­sity of their coali­tion and ex­posed a gen­er­a­tional gulf that is in­creas­ingly defin­ing the party.</p>
    <p>De­nied the chance to as­sem­ble in Mil­wau­kee be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, Demo­cratic ac­tivists and dig­ni­taries on Tues­day night cast their votes from lo­ca­tions across the na­tion.</p>
    <p>Ap­pear­ing with his wife in a Delaware school after his home state put him over the top, Mr Bi­den was feted by his grand­chil­dren, who wore T-shirts bear­ing the words “No Malarkey” – one of his favourite phrases.</p>
    <p>“See you on Thurs­day,” he said, speak­ing briefly to thank the del­e­gates and re­fer­ring to the day he will for­mally ac­cept the nom­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>The se­cond night of the Demo­cratic Na­tional Con­ven­tion strad­dled themes of na­tional se­cu­rity, pres­i­den­tial ac­count­abil­ity and con­ti­nu­ity be­tween the party’s past and fu­ture lead­ers.</p>
    <p>Two tributes by Re­pub­li­cans car­ried sym­bolic weight for a Demo­cratic can­di­date seek­ing to ap­peal across party lines: Mr Colin Pow­ell, re­tired gen­eral and for­mer sec­re­tary of state in the Ge­orge W. Bush ad­min­is­tra­tion, and Mrs Cindy McCain, widow of Sen­a­tor John McCain.</p>
    <p>By vot­ing to nom­i­nate Mr Bi­den, 77, Democrats de­liv­ered to the for­mer vice-pres­i­dent a prize he had pur­sued in­ter­mit­tently for three</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s long-awaited vic­tory is a tri­umph of per­sonal and po­lit­i­cal en­durance, rep­re­sent­ing the apex – so far – of a slow up­ward climb by a man who en­tered the US Se­nate in 1972 at age 30 as a griev­ing sin­gle fa­ther.</p>
    <p>decades. Two pre­vi­ous pres­i­den­tial cam­paigns, in 1988 and 2008, had ended in abrupt de­feat.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s long-awaited vic­tory is a tri­umph of per­sonal and po­lit­i­cal en­durance, rep­re­sent­ing the apex – so far – of a slow up­ward climb by a man who en­tered the US Se­nate in 1972 at age 30 as a griev­ing sin­gle fa­ther.</p>
    <p>Much of Tues­day’s pro­gramme was dom­i­nated by some of the most fa­mil­iar faces from the Demo­cratic Party’s past, in­clud­ing for­mer pres­i­dents Bill Clin­ton and Jimmy Carter.</p>
    <p>Re­plac­ing the tra­di­tional key­note ad­dress, a group of younger of­fi­cials whom the Democrats hope to cul­ti­vate as lead­ers of the fu­ture de­liv­ered an or­a­tor­i­cal col­lage.</p>
    <p>The party re­turned again and again to a few core pol­icy themes.</p>
    <p>One seg­ment showed Mr Bi­den con­fer­ring with vot­ers about the cost of health­care, a sub­ject he vowed to take on. Other Democrats stressed the ur­gency of con­fronting gun vi­o­lence and cli­mate change, and sev­eral called for restor­ing the United States’ as­sertive role in for­eign pol­icy.</p>
    <p>For­mer se­cond lady Jill Bi­den oc­cu­pied the most prom­i­nent speak­ing slot of the night. She de­scribed the uneasy mood grip­ping Amer­i­can fam­i­lies and said she shared it: “Like so many of you, I’m left ask­ing: How do I keep my fam­ily safe?”</p>
    <p>“There are those who want to tell us that our coun­try is hope­lessly di­vided, that our dif­fer­ences are ir­rec­on­cil­able,” Mrs Bi­den said, in­sist­ing that she took a dif­fer­ent view.</p>
    <p>“We have shown that the heart of this na­tion still beats with kind­ness and courage. That’s the soul of Amer­ica Joe Bi­den is fight­ing for now.”</p>
    <p>The roll call vote – a con­ven­tion tra­di­tion – gave Mr Bi­den his long­sought prize.</p>
    <p>The pre­sen­ta­tion read as a stateby-state cat­a­logue of many of the most dan­ger­ous prob­lems fac­ing the coun­try, as lo­cal ac­tivists and elected lead­ers de­tailed their own ex­pe­ri­ences with Trump-era crises as they cast their del­e­gate votes.</p>
    <p>Cast­ing Florida’s votes for Mr Bi­den, Mr Fred Gut­ten­berg, the fa­ther of a young stu­dent slain in the Park­land school shoot­ing, re­called Mr Bi­den’s phone call to him after the tragedy and pre­dicted that once in of­fice, Mr Bi­den and his run­ning mate Ka­mala Har­ris would van­quish the Na­tional Ri­fle As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
