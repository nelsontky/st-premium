    <p>New plant-based meat alternativ­e player Next Gen has put roots down in Sin­ga­pore with a re­search and de­vel­op­ment (R&D) cen­tre and its head­quar­ters here.</p>
    <p>The home-grown firm, which has six em­ploy­ees in­clud­ing its co­founders and chief tech­nol­ogy of­fi­cer, in­tends to put out its alternativ­e chicken prod­uct by March next year. The firm of­fi­cially launched to­day.</p>
    <p>Its US$2.2 mil­lion (S$3 mil­lion) seed fund­ing is pro­vided by co­founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive Timo Recker, through his exit from Ger­man plant-based meat com­pany LikeMeat fol­low­ing its ac­qui­si­tion ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>The firm’s co-founder and chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer An­dre Menezes told The Straits Times that the startup cap­i­tal has been used to as­sem­ble the com­pany’s team here and get its R&D cen­tre, which is lo­cated in Shen­ton Way, up and run­ning. It is also chan­nelled to­wards the de­vel­op­ment of com­mercial part­ner­ships and brand­ing, he added.</p>
    <p>The firm is cur­rently rais­ing a bridge fi­nanc­ing round, which will be closed by the end of the year, for its ex­pan­sion plans in Asia.</p>
    <p>It also aims to raise an­other round of fund­ing in the sec­ond half of next year, Mr Recker said.</p>
    <p>Next Gen cur­rently has man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­ity that can sup­ply about 9,000 restau­rants a year, through its part­ner in the Nether­lands. In­stead of run­ning its own fac­to­ries, Next Gen has cho­sen to em­u­late lead­ing play­ers and work with man­u­fac­tur­ing part­ners around the globe, Mr Menezes said.</p>
    <p>“We de­cided from the be­gin­ning that we want to de­velop a model in which we can ex­pand glob­ally quickly... De­mand for this cat­e­gory has been boom­ing,” he said, adding that they sought a sup­ply chain net­work and model that would be able to cope with quick ex­pan­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Menezes has been work­ing in Sin­ga­pore for close to five years and was pre­vi­ously gen­eral man­ager of Coun­try Foods, which dis­trib­utes Im­pos­si­ble Foods’ meat-alternativ­e prod­ucts in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He pointed to Sin­ga­pore’s con­ducive busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment, its bud­ding agri-food ecosys­tem and large pool of chefs across dif­fer­ent cuisines as rea­sons for Next Gen’s de­ci­sion to set up here.</p>
    <p>Mr Recker added: “If you look at the mar­kets to­day, the United States, Europe are ob­vi­ously very de­vel­oped in the plant-based meats space. In Asia, we see a lot of po­ten­tial, but the mar­ket is not yet de­vel­oped to the same ex­tent.</p>
    <p>“(We feel that) we can re­ally bring the tech­nol­ogy and prod­uct here, and cre­ate a mar­ket-lead­ing com­pany in a field which is not yet oc­cu­pied. There are play­ers do­ing beef burg­ers, or pork, but no­body is re­ally push­ing for­ward with chicken.”</p>
