    <p>Pasir Ris res­i­dents have spo­ken, and most of those polled want the wildlife – es­pe­cially the wild chick­ens – roam­ing in their neigh­bour­hood to stay.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter Teo Chee Hean posted the re­sults of the Sur­vey on Wild An­i­mals in Pasir Ris Es­tate on his Face­book page on Tues­day, af­ter a two-week on­line poll with 4,688 re­spon­dents that ended on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The wild chick­ens cap­tured the hearts of 72 per cent of the re­spon­dents, who wanted them to con­tinue to roam free.</p>
    <p>Sen­ti­ments were, how­ever, mixed when it came to stray dogs and wild boars. About one-third (32 per cent) of re­spon­dents said wild boars should be al­lowed to wan­der as they wish, and a tad more (35 per cent) said the same for stray dogs.</p>
    <p>Al­most 30 per cent would like the dogs and wild boars to re­main in Pasir Ris, but in con­trolled num­bers.</p>
    <p>Nearly 40 per cent voted for all wild boars to be re­moved or re­lo­cated from their neigh­bour­hood, and 36 per cent voted the same for the stray dogs.</p>
    <p>For other wild an­i­mals, half of those polled wanted them to con­tinue to roam freely in their neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>Among the poll re­spon­dents, 4,505 are Pasir Ris res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Mr Teo, leader of the five-MP team for Pasir Ris-Pung­gol GRC, had posted the on­line sur­vey on Nov 22, af­ter a wild boar at­tack in the area last month.</p>
    <p>A wild boar had charged at a 50-year-old woman in Sungei Api Api Park on Nov 17 and knocked her down.</p>
    <p>The woman suf­fered lac­er­a­tions on her left leg and her face.</p>
    <p>Mr Teo said the sur­vey re­sults have been sent to the Na­tional Parks Board (NParks).</p>
    <p>“Many res­i­dents also com­mented that we should have more ed­u­ca­tion ef­forts on in­ter­ac­tions be­tween hu­mans and wild an­i­mals,” he said.</p>
    <p>His team wel­comes the of­fer by the Animal Con­cerns Re­search and Ed­u­ca­tion So­ci­ety (Acres) to work with NParks to help in­form Pasir Ris res­i­dents and park users about such in­ter­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Acres’ deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive Kalai Vanan said it is a pos­i­tive to see that most re­spon­dents want the an­i­mals to re­main.</p>
    <p>He also said that there is an on­go­ing, ef­fec­tive, is­land­wide TrapNeuter-Re­lease-Man­age pro­gramme for dogs “which is a hu­mane long-term so­lu­tion to the stray dog pop­u­la­tion, com­pared with sim­ply re­moval”.</p>
    <p>Two weeks ago, Mr Teo vis­ited the res­i­dent who was in­jured by the wild boar.</p>
    <p>“She has re­turned home af­ter sev­eral days in hospi­tal and is re­cov­er­ing, but still re­quires some med­i­cal pro­ce­dures in the com­ing weeks,” he posted on his Face­book page.</p>
    <p>Some Pasir Ris res­i­dents, like in­vestor re­la­tions man­ager Janet Chia, 31, said the find­ings did not sur­prise her, as wild boars and stray dogs can be per­ceived as more in­tim­i­dat­ing than wild chick­ens.</p>
    <p>Un­der­grad­u­ate Teoh Xin Yi, 22, said some of her fam­ily mem­bers had been chased by stray dogs while cy­cling at a park con­nec­tor in Pasir Ris.</p>
    <p>“De­spite the neg­a­tive en­counter, we en­joy the wildlife around us. My dad en­joys watch­ing the wild boars roam­ing, but from a dis­tance.”</p>
    <p>Mr Teo, mean­while, em­pha­sised that peo­ple should not feed wild an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>“Feed­ing the an­i­mals en­cour­ages them to ap­proach hu­mans for food. Feed­ing also pro­vides them more food than the nor­mal en­vi­ron­ment can sup­port.”</p>
    <p>MORE ED­U­CA­TION NEEDED</p>
    <p>Many res­i­dents also com­mented that we should have more ed­u­ca­tion ef­forts on in­ter­ac­tions be­tween hu­mans and wild an­i­mals.</p>
