    <p>HONG KONG • With the ma­jor­ity of op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers stay­ing on in Hong Kong’s Par­lia­ment for another year after the cur­rent Leg­isla­tive Council (Legco) term ends to­day, dif­fer­ences that have sur­faced within the pan-demo­cratic camp are not ex­pected to es­ca­late, ob­servers believe.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Sing Ming of the Hong Kong Univer­sity of Science and Tech­nol­ogy said he is “only slightly wor­ried” about the pro­longed in­ter­nal bick­er­ing among the pan-demo­cratic law­mak­ers. He be­lieves the risk of fur­ther in­ter­nal po­lar­i­sa­tion, which is not new, has been slightly mod­er­ated by the re­sults of a poll re­leased yesterday.</p>
    <p>The poll was com­mis­sioned by the Demo­cratic Party as a barom­e­ter for the pan-dem law­mak­ers to de­cide if they will keep their 23 seats in the 70-mem­ber LegCo, or leave when their four-year term ends. The next LegCo ses­sion starts on Oct 14.</p>
    <p>About 2,500 peo­ple par­tic­i­pated in the sur­vey last week, of which 730 said they were sup­port­ers of the op­po­si­tion camp.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey found that 47.1 per cent of the re­spon­dents said the op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers ought to stay on in the LegCo. This is 1.3 per­cent­age points more than those who sup­ported the law­mak­ers leav­ing.</p>
    <p>Prof Sing noted that even though the public can feel that gen­eral free­doms in Hong Kong, in­clud­ing the right to assem­ble and protest, have been broadly re­strained with the na­tional se­cu­rity law, there is no clear road map on how to launch an ef­fec­tive po­lit­i­cal strug­gle for democ­racy.</p>
    <p>The poll rep­re­sents “a sense of greater con­scious­ness and the preva­lence of prag­ma­tism” among the peo­ple, he said.</p>
    <p>“The pan-dems can then ride on this change in the public at­ti­tude and jus­tify their con­tin­ued role in the leg­is­la­ture,” he added.</p>
    <p>Yesterday, 15 of the 23 op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers, most of whom be­long to tra­di­tional po­lit­i­cal par­ties, de­clared their de­ci­sion to stay on in the LegCo for the com­ing year.</p>
    <p>This fol­lowed China’s de­ci­sion in Au­gust to ex­tend the term of LegCo by at least a year, putting an end to a leg­isla­tive vac­uum in the ter­ri­tory. LegCo elec­tions were ini­tially sched­uled for Sept 6, but Hong Kong post­poned the polls till Sept 5 next year be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion l aw­mak­ers were fret­ting over whether they should re­sign en masse or stay on in the council, as some be­lieved re­main­ing could be viewed as bow­ing to pres­sure from Bei­jing. The more ex­treme ones be­lieved in quit­ting as a way to dele­git­imise Hong Kong’s post­pone­ment of the LegCo elec­tion.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Al­fred Wu of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Pol­icy said the an­nounce­ment by the pan-dem camp showed that it is weak­ened as there are mem­bers who can­not work to­gether.</p>
    <p>He noted that there are those like lo­cal­ist law­maker Chu Hoi Dick who are leav­ing to be ac­count­able to those sup­port­ers who would have pre­ferred them to leave.</p>
    <p>“The is­sue now is that... those who stay on will not have the same kind of power (or ef­fect in LegCo) as be­fore be­cause they can­not do more with less so a lot of new Bills can now be passed. Although it’s sad (there will be no checks), it’s the re­al­ity,” said Prof Wu.</p>
    <p>The pan-demo­cratic camp’s new con­venor, Demo­cratic Party chair­man Wu Chi Wai, said that stay­ing on is the lesser of two evils, as do­ing so would at least still al­low the op­po­si­tion some power to de­lay ob­jec­tion­able poli­cies. “We can at least have some power, some force to fight against the govern­ment,” he said.</p>
