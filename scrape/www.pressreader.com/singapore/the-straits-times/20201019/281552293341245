    <p>Malaysia’s Pris­ons De­part­ment re­cently an­nounced a plan to free se­lected in­mates in a bid to break the coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion chain be­hind bars. But the plan has raised con­cerns among the public, who fear that crime cases would rise fol­low­ing their re­lease.</p>
    <p>When Malaysia’s Pris­ons De­part­ment an­nounced a plan to free se­lected in­mates in a bid to break the Covid-19 in­fec­tion chain be­hind bars, it gave Madam Tan Kam Chee hope that she might be able to see her son soon.</p>
    <p>The 78-year-old said her son, in his 40s, is due to be re­leased next month af­ter be­ing con­victed of theft and im­pris­oned in Pe­nang late last year. But the pan­demic has had her wor­ry­ing about his health.</p>
    <p>“I haven’t been able to sleep well. Ev­ery day, I will look for up­dates on the Pe­nang prison clus­ter. I hope he re­mains in good health and will be re­leased soon,” Madam Tan told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Out­breaks be­hind bars con­tinue to pose a chal­lenge for state gov­ern­ments, as many pris­ons suf­fer from over­crowd­ing.</p>
    <p>Malaysia is also in the midst of a third wave of in­fec­tions, with a record high of 871 new daily cases re­ported yes­ter­day, rais­ing the coun­try’s tally to 20,498. Most of the new cases were de­tected in Sabah state.</p>
    <p>One of the worst prison clus­ters is in the Alor Setar prison in Kedah, with at least 1,571 cases. The clus­ter was de­tected on Sept 30, fol­low­ing the death of a 46-year-old man who worked there. Sub­se­quent tests dis­cov­ered that the virus had spread among in­mates.</p>
    <p>A clus­ter in Sabah, which orig­i­nated from a dis­trict po­lice lock-up in La­had Datu and spread to Tawau Prison, has recorded at least 1,050 cases. An­other clus­ter at Pe­nang Re­mand Prison has seen at least 399 cases and one death.</p>
    <p>Lock­downs have been en­forced at these pris­ons, with no move­ments in or out al­lowed.</p>
    <p>To stop fur­ther in­fec­tions and re­duce crowd­ing, di­rec­tor-gen­eral of pris­ons Zulk­i­fli Omar on Oct 6 an­nounced that the de­part­ment will grant a re­lease on li­cence, or a re­lease with con­di­tions, to mi­nor of­fend­ers sen­tenced to less than a year of im­pris­on­ment and who had less than three months left to serve.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion law­maker Liew Chin Tong wel­comed the move, say­ing: “These mea­sures are cru­cial be­cause the is­sue of over­crowd­ing in pris­ons had al­ready ex­isted be­fore the Covid-19 out­break.”</p>
    <p>Mr Liew added that lock­ing up those who had re­cently vi­o­lated move­ment curbs and anti-virus mea­sures such as mask-wear­ing would also worsen the over­crowd­ing prob­lem.</p>
    <p>But the plan has raised con­cerns among the public, who fear that crime cases would rise fol­low­ing the re­lease of the in­mates.</p>
    <p>Crim­i­nol­o­gist Geshina Ayu Mat Saat told The Straits Times that while des­per­ate times may lead to des­per­ate mea­sures to sur­vive, pre­dict­ing what will hap­pen is “dif­fi­cult”. Aside from hav­ing to com­pete for a job with those who have been re­trenched, in­mates would also need to ad­just to the new norms in the out­side world amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“It is likely that they will go back to a life of crime – but bear in mind, the pool of po­ten­tial vic­tims will also be prac­tis­ing new norms; petty crim­i­nals will have less op­por­tu­ni­ties and less ac­cess to phys­i­cally con­front po­ten­tial vic­tims,” Dr Geshina said.</p>
    <p>“What is likely to hap­pen is crime dis­place­ment, where crime lo­ca­tion shifts or crime type changes due to en­vi­ron­men­tal and so­cial crime preven­tion strate­gies in pre­vi­ously known hot spots.</p>
    <p>“This means in­creases in on­line fraud and com­mer­cial crime vic­tim­i­sa­tion, which is al­ready hap­pen­ing even with­out the pres­ence of ex-in­mates in our so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>Dr Geshina be­lieves that some forms of crime that take place be­hind closed doors will con­tinue – such as do­mes­tic vi­o­lence, on­line gam­bling, child abuse and porno­graphic-re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“Eco­nomic stress, dys­func­tional re­la­tion­ships, hos­tile en­vi­ron­ments and ad­verse con­di­tions may eas­ily trig­ger vi­o­lent acts, and not all the abusers are ex-in­mates.”</p>
    <p>Based on the Pris­ons De­part­ment’s records as at Oct 5, there are 11,018 in­mates who have been sen­tenced to jail for less than one year, with less than three months left to serve. To be re­leased on li­cence, they must meet strict se­lec­tion cri­te­ria and pass a Covid-19 screen­ing by the Health Min­istry.</p>
    <p>Bar Coun­cil pres­i­dent Salim Bashir ex­plained that Sec­tion 43 of the Pris­ons Act al­lows de­tainees to be re­leased on li­cence sub­ject to rules and reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>He said: “The re­lease on li­cence is gov­erned by con­di­tions im­posed by the prison au­thor­i­ties, and any breach of that will be a sep­a­rate of­fence. The de­ci­sion is wel­comed as a good move to pre­vent the spread of Covid 19 in­fec­tions among in­mates, and to min­imise over­crowd­ing in prison.”</p>
    <p>Epi­demi­ol­o­gist Awang Bulgiba Awang Mah­mud of Univer­siti Malaya said that from an epi­demi­o­log­i­cal point of view, “it is a sound move”, adding: “This will make phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing more doable in pris­ons, al­though I would sup­pose there would need to be a sub­stan­tial num­ber of prison in­mates be­ing re­leased for this to be pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Datuk Dr Awang said that the pris­on­ers should first be iso­lated from the rest of the prison pop­u­la­tion for 14 days and tested twice dur­ing this time. “Should their two tests prove neg­a­tive, then it is safe to re­lease them,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Geshina hopes that those re­leased will be ad­e­quately pre­pared to cope with the new norms.</p>
    <p>She asked: “Will they be given suf­fi­cient self-pro­tec­tion equip­ment? At least un­til they can sup­port them­selves? If they do get in­fected be­cause of their early re­lease, what then?”</p>
