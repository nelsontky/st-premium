    <p>When she was just 16 years old, Ms Sun­daram Mo­han Shak­thi learnt that the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force is not about “just catch­ing and pun­ish­ing crim­i­nals”. Hav­ing been awarded the SPF Schol­ar­ship, she is one of 23 re­cip­i­ents of the Pub­lic Ser­vice Com­mis­sion schol­ar­ships who are mov­ing ahead with their stud­ies this year.</p>
    <p>When she was just 16 years old, Ms Sun­daram Mo­han Shak­thi learnt that the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force (SPF) is not about “just catch­ing and pun­ish­ing crim­i­nals”.</p>
    <p>It also fo­cuses on re­ha­bil­i­tat­ing of­fend­ers and pro­vid­ing so­cial sup­port to their family mem­bers.</p>
    <p>This was a call­ing which res­onated with her.</p>
    <p>One night, her family had to call the po­lice be­cause of her fa­ther. He had a his­tory of be­ing ver­bally abu­sive, and was rais­ing a ruckus at home.</p>
    <p>“A lot of of­fi­cers came. Be­sides those who were deal­ing with my fa­ther and giv­ing him a warn­ing, there were other of­fi­cers ded­i­cated solely to cater­ing to the rest of my family and mak­ing sure we were okay,” said Ms Shak­thi, now 19.</p>
    <p>Her par­ents have since di­vorced. “There was this one investigat­ion of­fi­cer who gave us her per­sonal mo­bile num­ber and said we could call her any time we needed help. We never did call her, but it was the ges­ture that made all the dif­fer­ence, be­cause she went out of her way to of­fer help.”</p>
    <p>Ms Shak­thi is one of 23 Pub­lic Ser­vice Com­mis­sion (PSC) schol­ar­ship re­cip­i­ents who are pro­ceed­ing with their stud­ies this year.</p>
    <p>She has been awarded the SPF Schol­ar­ship and will be read­ing psy­chol­ogy at Yale-NUS Col­lege in Sin­ga­pore from next month.</p>
    <p>The Pub­lic Ser­vice Di­vi­sion said that from now on, only PSC schol­ar­ship re­cip­i­ents who are pur­su­ing their stud­ies in the cur­rent year will be an­nounced.</p>
    <p>Those who have de­cided to pro­ceed with their stud­ies in sub­se­quent years, such as male stu­dents do­ing their na­tional ser­vice, will be in­cluded in the rel­e­vant years’ re­ports.</p>
    <p>Ms Shak­thi said: “I felt that this fo­cus of the SPF (on re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion and so­cial sup­port) was very unique, and is some­thing that I want to con­trib­ute to in the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>She said she de­cided to read psy­chol­ogy be­cause when she was study­ing at Raf­fles Girls’ School, she had a few friends who were ex­pe­ri­enc­ing men­tal health is­sues such as anx­i­ety and de­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>“I found my­self very con­cerned for them. I would go home and re­search what they were go­ing through, to try to bet­ter un­der­stand and help them.</p>
    <p>“That’s when I re­alised that pro­vid­ing emo­tional sup­port to the peo­ple around me was some­thing that was very im­por­tant to me,” added Ms Shak­thi, who went on to study at Raf­fles In­sti­tu­tion (RI).</p>
    <p>Psy­chol­ogy was a good av­enue for her to learn how to sup­port oth­ers in times of dis­tress, she said.</p>
    <p>“There aren’t usu­ally many fe­males who get (the SPF Schol­ar­ship)... It’s a huge priv­i­lege and hon­our to be en­trusted with a ca­reer in the uni­formed ser­vice,” she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Shak­thi’s RI school­mate Janika Oh, also 19, has been awarded the PSC Schol­ar­ship (En­gi­neer­ing).</p>
    <p>In­tro­duced in 2017, the PSC Schol­ar­ship (En­gi­neer­ing) aims to de­velop in­di­vid­u­als for lead­er­ship po­si­tions in the en­gi­neer­ing and technology ar­eas of the pub­lic sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Ms Oh de­vel­oped a “love for build­ing things” as a child.</p>
    <p>She also has a pas­sion for music and has learnt to play in­stru­ments such as the pi­ano, erhu, guzheng and drums.</p>
    <p>She will be pur­su­ing a de­gree in me­chan­i­cal en­gi­neer­ing at Carnegie Mel­lon Univer­sity in the United States, with re­mote learn­ing for the first se­mes­ter start­ing next month.</p>
    <p>She is also plan­ning to ap­ply for a sec­ond ma­jor in music from her sec­ond year.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing read physics, eco­nom­ics, math­e­mat­ics and music at RI, Ms Oh said: “Study­ing the sci­ences gives me the logic and think­ing needed to solve prob­lems ef­fi­ciently. Study­ing the arts gives me an un­der­stand­ing of emo­tions and a cre­ative out­look on prob­lems.</p>
    <p>“So through study­ing both, I was able to be a more holis­tic per­son, look­ing at things from a dif­fer­ent per­spec­tive and think­ing out of the box. That ben­e­fited me a lot.”</p>
    <p>Mr Chan Choon Yong, an­other re­cip­i­ent of the PSC Schol­ar­ship (En­gi­neer­ing), said he was in­ter­ested in cy­ber se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>The 19-year-old from Tampines Merid­ian Ju­nior Col­lege will be pur­su­ing a dou­ble ma­jor in com­puter sci­ence and sta­tis­tics at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said he hoped to con­trib­ute new ideas and spear­head in­no­va­tions in the area of cy­ber se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>He added: “I be­lieve that my un­der­grad­u­ate de­gree... will pro­vide abun­dant tech­ni­cal ex­pe­ri­ence in th­ese com­plex fields and many net­work­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties with lo­cal and for­eign experts.”</p>
