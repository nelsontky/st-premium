    <p>The Straits Times Run will be a qui­eter, more per­sonal af­fair this year as it takes on a vir­tual for­mat for the first time, ow­ing to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>While it may be a very dif­fer­ent ex­pe­ri­ence from pre­vi­ous years’ races, that was ex­actly what in­spired ST artist Lee Chee Chew as he was com­ing up with the de­sign for what fin­ish­ers are en­ti­tled to: a New Bal­ance NB Dry T-shirt worth $49.</p>
    <p>Want­ing the fi­nal prod­uct to re­flect the cur­rent cir­cum­stances, but with a light-hearted touch, the 54-year-old de­signed a car­toon that shows a run­ner leap­ing over a coro­n­avirus par­ti­cle.</p>
    <p>This is the first time that a car­toon has been incorporat­ed into the ST Run T-shirt’s look.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said: “I wanted some­thing on the shirt that ex­plains what caused ST to have a vir­tual run, and the cul­prit – Covid-19 – is the ob­vi­ous choice.</p>
    <p>“To make the draw­ing more fun, I added a run­ner mak­ing a ges­ture that shows both play­ful­ness and dis­gust at the virus.”</p>
    <p>He hopes that the de­sign will of­fer some form of en­cour­age­ment dur­ing th­ese un­prece­dented times.</p>
    <p>“The vis­ual of the run­ner jump­ing over the virus con­veys the mes­sage that we should be un­daunted by the pan­demic,” added Mr Lee, who is known for his pop­u­lar “Chew On It!” comic strips.</p>
    <p>His comic strip in The Straits Times is called Chee Chew’s Take.</p>
    <p>ST sports editor Lee Yulin, who is also or­gan­is­ing chair­man of The Straits Times Vir­tual Run (STVR), said: “Giv­ing our fin­ish­ers an iconic</p>
    <p>T-shirt to mark their par­tic­i­pa­tion in the vir­tual run is the least we can do to re­ward them for their sup­port.</p>
    <p>“We are de­lighted that Chee Chew has lent his con­sid­er­able tal­ents and de­signed a unique keep­sake for our par­tic­i­pants.”</p>
    <p>Race fin­ish­ers will also re­ceive an un­usual medal, which can com­plete the three-piece keep­sake in­tro­duced by the ST Run last year.</p>
    <p>When com­bined, the three pieces will form an im­age of the city’s land­scape, which has formed the back­drop of the ST Run in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>To com­mem­o­rate the news­pa­per’s 175th an­niver­sary, there will be two dis­tances of­fered for the STVR – 17.5km and 175km.</p>
    <p>Those who com­plete the 17.5km event will re­ceive the sec­ond part of the medal, while those who go the full 175km dis­tance will re­ceive both the sec­ond and third pieces.</p>
    <p>The first piece was awarded to ST Run race fin­ish­ers last year.</p>
    <p>The race pe­riod for the 17.5km run is Oct 9 to 18, while the 175km run will take place from Oct 19 to Dec 17.</p>
    <p>En­try fees for past par­tic­i­pants of the ST Run are $15 (17.5km) and $20 (175km). Early-bird prices are $18 and $23, re­spec­tively, till Sept 11. Nor­mal rates are $22 and $27.</p>
    <p>Run­ners are al­lowed to record their dis­tances over sev­eral ses­sions and at any out­door lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Reg­is­tra­tion closes at 11.59pm on Oct 4.</p>
    <p>Those in­ter­ested can sign up at www.strait­stimes­run.com</p>
    <p>For up­dates, fol­low the event’s Face­book and In­sta­gram pages (@thes­trait­stimes­run).</p>
    <p>BOTH PLAY­FUL AND SE­RI­OUS</p>
    <p>To make the draw­ing more fun, I added a run­ner mak­ing a ges­ture that shows both play­ful­ness and dis­gust at the virus. The vis­ual of the run­ner jump­ing over the virus con­veys the mes­sage that we should be un­daunted ’’ by the pan­demic.</p>

        <p data-role="text">For the first time, the T-shirt for The Straits Times Run fea&#xAD;tures a car&#xAD;toon. ST artist Lee Chee Chew&#x2019;s de&#xAD;sign of a run&#xAD;ner jump&#xAD;ing over a coro&#xAD;n&#xAD;avirus par&#xAD;ti&#xAD;cle shows why the run is a vir&#xAD;tual one this year.</p>
