    <p>Yan­gon res­i­dents have been holed up at home in the run-up to Myan­mar’s Nov 8 gen­eral election be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Many were hooked on so­cial me­dia which was awash in red.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing Na­tional League for Democ­racy (NLD) ran cam­paigns else­where, fly­ing its red fight­ing pea­cock flag on Face­book, and on cars, boats and bul­lock carts.</p>
    <p>A re­cent cam­paign pro­ces­sion in the Man­dalay re­gion in­volved youth danc­ing atop trucks, horses decked out with the party logo, and ele­phants haul­ing a giant por­trait of party leader and state coun­sel­lor Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>
    <p>It looked more like a vic­tory pa­rade.</p>
    <p>Widely ex­pected to tri­umph again, the NLD has not changed its win­ning for­mula which largely leans on the charisma and in­flu­ence of 75-year-old Ms Suu Kyi. Its 2020 election man­i­festo is light on specifics and heavy with broad prom­ises to­wards peace, sus­tain­able developmen­t and a gen­uine fed­eral democ­racy.</p>
    <p>Per­haps more re­veal­ing were Ms Suu Kyi’s com­ments as she un­veiled the party’s can­di­dates in July. “The road that the NLD has taken is very rough. It is long, un­end­ing,” she was quoted by Fron­tier Myan­mar as say­ing. “That is why we place so much em­pha­sis on en­durance and loy­alty.”</p>
    <p>The NLD will be count­ing on voter loy­alty in this election, given its lack­lus­tre first-term per­for­mance, wrestling with a di­archy fash­ioned by the coun­try’s for­mer mil­i­tary rulers.</p>
    <p>In 2015, the party won 57 per cent of the pop­u­lar vote and 79 per cent of the elected seats in the na­tional Lower House, a solid block against the mil­i­tary, which is guar­an­teed a quar­ter of all par­lia­ment seats as well as con­trol of the de­fence, bor­der af­fairs and home af­fairs min­istries.</p>
    <p>Party spokesman Monywa Aung Shin says the gov­ern­ment was able to im­prove trans­parency dur­ing its first term. “There was a good rule of law dur­ing NLD’s term in gov­ern­ment. There was trans­parency,” he says.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple to­day dare to speak freely and they dare to protest too. This is where we have suc­ceeded.”</p>
    <p>Sup­port­ers say change has been slow but vis­i­ble. With in­ter­na­tional aid, some 50 per cent of Myan­mar house­holds are now con­nected to the elec­tric­ity grid, com­pared with 35 per cent in 2016.</p>
    <p>“I sup­port them be­cause I see how they changed peo­ple’s lives,” says Ms Khin Yu­par, 38, a com­pany pur­chaser in Dawei, south Myan­mar. She says im­proved ameni­ties in her home town have re­duced healthcare costs and halved her travel time to Yan­gon.</p>
    <p>After an ini­tial pol­icy log­jam, the NLD ad­min­is­tra­tion dis­man­tled enough busi­ness hur­dles to help Myan­mar climb in the lat­est World Bank’s Ease of Do­ing Busi­ness rank­ings, to 165th out of 190 economies.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic shrank Myan­mar’s eco­nomic growth fore­cast this year to 0.5 per cent, com­pared with 6.8 per cent last year, ac­cord­ing to the lat­est World Bank pro­jec­tions. Yet the coun­try still man­aged to at­tract US$5.68 bil­lion (S$7.75 bil­lion) in for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment by end-Septem­ber. Its tar­get was US$5.8 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Still, de­spite its rel­a­tively big­ger say on eco­nomic is­sues, the ad­min­is­tra­tion failed to ar­tic­u­late clear poli­cies to re­ha­bil­i­tate an economy left stunted by years of iso­la­tion and eco­nomic sanc­tions, notes Ms Ngu Wah Win, a se­nior pol­icy co­or­di­na­tor for the Cen­tre for Eco­nomic and So­cial Developmen­t, who is also a vice-chair­man of the op­po­si­tion Peo­ple’s Pi­o­neer Party.</p>
    <p>Ms Vicky Bow­man, di­rec­tor of the Myan­mar Cen­tre for Re­spon­si­ble Busi­ness, says: “While the NLD as­sumed power with­out pre­vi­ous gov­ern­ment ex­pe­ri­ence and had to wres­tle with a civil ser­vice which has been pro­gres­sively deskilled, de­funded and de­mor­alised over five decades of so­cial­ist and mil­i­tary rule, they could have done bet­ter to give a clearer and more de­tailed pol­icy and po­lit­i­cal vi­sion ear­lier in their ten­ure and ap­point more en­er­getic and tal­ented min­is­ters with stronger party in­stincts to lead min­istries rather than be led by them.”</p>
    <p>On the in­ter­na­tional front, Myan­mar’s Ro­hingya cri­sis has pushed the coun­try back into pariah sta­tus. Ms Suu Kyi’s fronting of Myan­mar’s de­fence last year against al­le­ga­tions of geno­cide at the In­ter­na­tional</p>
    <p>Court of Jus­tice was de­cried as an at­tempt to pan­der to na­tion­al­ist sen­ti­ments back home.</p>
    <p>Myan­mar’s other mi­nori­ties have voiced fears of grow­ing marginal­i­sa­tion. Peace talks to end long-run­ning civil wars are mak­ing lit­tle head­way, with one of the most pow­er­ful eth­nic armed groups, the Arakan Army, shut out by virtue of the gov­ern­ment la­belling it a ter­ror­ist or­gan­i­sa­tion. Myan­mar’s election com­mis­sion last month can­celled vot­ing in the whole or in parts for the ma­jor­ity of town­ships in Rakhine state – where eth­nic-based par­ties posted the strong­est showing in the last election.</p>
    <p>In a scathing re­port last month, pol­icy re­search and ad­vo­cacy group Pro­gres­sive Voice said: “As the ul­ti­mate ar­biter of power for so many years, the Myan­mar mil­i­tary has long ben­e­fited from the con­structed nar­ra­tives of hate aimed at ad­vanc­ing Ba­mar Bud­dhist dom­i­nance at the ex­pense of eth­nic and re­li­gious mi­nori­ties in the coun­try. But, more re­cently, the NLD gov­ern­ment has in­creas­ingly aligned it­self with such rhetoric.”</p>
    <p>In­stead of ad­dress­ing the root causes of hate speech and in­sti­tu­tion­alised dis­crim­i­na­tion, Pro­gres­sive Voice al­leged that the NLD gov­ern­ment had “cho­sen to ex­ploit pop­u­lar anti-mi­nor­ity sen­ti­ment for po­lit­i­cal gain”.</p>
    <p>With Covid-19 in­fec­tions climb­ing at over 1,000 a day and to­tal cases hav­ing crossed 54,000, an NLD ad­min­is­tra­tion will have its hands full after the election.</p>
    <p>It will look like a dif­fer­ent party com­pared with five years ago, hav­ing shed out­spo­ken or dis­il­lu­sioned stal­warts and al­lies who have ac­cused Ms Suu Kyi of mi­cro­manag­ing and sup­press­ing dis­sent.</p>
    <p>But diehards be­lieve she will pre­vail, just like how she with­stood some 15 years un­der house ar­rest as a po­lit­i­cal pris­oner of the pre­vi­ous mil­i­tary regime.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple say she is stub­born and doesn’t want to lis­ten to oth­ers,” says Ms Khin Yu­par. “But if she is not stub­born, we will still be ruled by the mil­i­tary junta now.”</p>
