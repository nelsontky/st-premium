    <p>BANGKOK • Face­book has blocked ac­cess within Thai­land to a group with one mil­lion mem­bers that has crit­i­cised the coun­try’s king, but said it was plan­ning a le­gal chal­lenge to the gov­ern­ment’s de­mand re­quir­ing it to block the group.</p>
    <p>The move comes amid near daily youth-led protests against the gov­ern­ment headed by the for­mer mil­i­tary junta chief and un­prece­dented calls for reforms of the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>The “Roy­al­ist Mar­ket­place” group was cre­ated in April by self­ex­iled aca­demic Pavin Chachavalp­ong­pun, a critic of the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>On Monday night, the group’s page brought up a mes­sage: “Ac­cess to this group has been re­stricted within Thai­land pur­suant to a le­gal re­quest from the Min­istry of Dig­i­tal Econ­omy and So­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>Mr Pavin, who lives in Ja­pan, said Face­book had bowed to the mil­i­tary-dom­i­nated gov­ern­ment’s pres­sure.</p>
    <p>“Our group is part of a democrati­sa­tion process, it is a space for free­dom of ex­pres­sion,” Mr Pavin told Reuters.</p>
    <p>“By do­ing this, Face­book is co­op­er­at­ing with the au­thor­i­tar­ian regime to ob­struct democ­racy and cul­ti­vat­ing au­thor­i­tar­i­an­ism in Thai­land.”</p>
    <p>Mr Pavin’s new group of the same name al­ready had over 500,000 mem­bers yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Face­book said yes­ter­day it was plan­ning to legally chal­lenge the Thai gov­ern­ment af­ter be­ing “com­pelled” to block ac­cess to the group.</p>
    <p>“Re­quests like this are se­vere, con­tra­vene in­ter­na­tional hu­man rights law, and have a chill­ing ef­fect on peo­ple’s abil­ity to ex­press them­selves,” a Face­book spokesman said.</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s lese ma­jeste laws, which for­bid de­fam­ing the king with penal­ties of up to 15 years in prison, are of­ten the ba­sis for such re­quests to block or re­move con­woman set off the sec­ond blast, as a soldier was ap­proach­ing her.</p>
    <p>Lt-Gen Sobe­jana said foren­sic ev­i­dence and video footage showed tent on so­cial me­dia plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Thai­land’s dig­i­tal min­is­ter ac­cused Face­book of not com­ply­ing with re­quests to re­strict con­tent, in­clud­ing in­sults to the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>On Aug 10, he gave Face­book 15 days to com­ply with court take­down or­ders or face charges un­der the coun­try’s Com­puter Crime Act, which car­ries a fine of up to 200,000 baht (S$8,685) and an ad­di­tional 5,000 baht per day un­til each or­der is ob­served.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal min­istry spokesman Putchapong Nodthaison­g said on Monday that Face­book co­op­er­ated be­fore the dead­line be­cause it un­the first at­tack was also car­ried out by a sui­cide bomber who tar­geted sol­diers buy­ing sup­plies at a gro­cery. But it could not yet be as­cerder­stood the con­text of Thai so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, po­lice said they had ar­rested hu­man rights lawyer Anon Nampa yes­ter­day – for a third time this month – to charge him with sedi­tion over his role in a po­lit­i­cal rally where calls were made for reforms to the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>“The po­lice brought Anon to the sta­tion to read him the charges for his protests on Aug 10, and will question him be­fore bring­ing him to court to file for de­ten­tion,” Po­lice Lieu­tenant-Gen­eral Am­phol Buarab­porn told Reuters.</p>
    <p>The rights lawyer will be held along with an­other po­lit­i­cal ac­tained whether the first at­tacker was also a woman.</p>
    <p>Lt-Gen Sobe­jana said one of the bombers could be the wi­dow of Nor­man La­suca, who on June 28 set off one of two bombs that ex­ploded in­side a tem­po­rary camp of a spe­cial army counter-ter­ror­ism unit in In­danan town, in Sulu.</p>
    <p>La­suca was the first Filipino con­firmed to have mounted a sui­cide at­tack in the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>The other bomber was prob­a­bly the wi­dow of Talha Jum­sah, also known as Abu Talha, said Lt-Gen Sobe­jana.</p>
    <p>Abu Talha was a “high-value” tar­get trained in bomb-mak­ing and had in­structed Abu Sayyaf mil­i­tants in set­ting up sui­cide at­tacks.</p>
    <p>He also served as “fi­nance con­duit and li­ai­son” between ISIS and the Abu Sayyaf. He was killed in a clash with se­cu­rity forces in Novem­ber last year in Patikul town, Sulu.</p>
    <p>“We had been mon­i­tor­ing these two fe­male sui­cide bombers,” LtGen Sobe­jana said.</p>
    <p>He said the trail went cold af­ter tivist, Panupong Jad­nok, who was ar­rested on Monday dur­ing a protest against Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha, who first seized power in a 2014 coup.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said both Anon and Panupong face charges for vi­o­lat­ing Ar­ti­cle 116, which cov­ers sedi­tion, and for breach­ing coronaviru­s restric­tions on public gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>Anon, 36, has been at the fore­front of a move­ment that has staged protests al­most daily for the past month in the South-east Asian coun­try. He was the first to call openly for changes to King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn’s role, break­ing a long­stand­ing ta­boo. four army in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cers who were track­ing the two were gunned down in still murky cir­cum­stances by po­lice­men en­forc­ing quar­an­tine restric­tions in Jolo.</p>
    <p>Lt-Gen Sobe­jana said the two sus­pected sui­cide bombers were be­lieved to have been of­fered refuge by the Abu Sayyaf fac­tion of Hatib Sawad­jaan, named in se­cu­rity doc­u­ments as ISIS’ new “emir” in the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>Sawad­jaan’s group was be­hind the twin sui­cide bomb­ings that tar­geted a Catholic cathe­dral in Jolo in Jan­uary last year. At least 23 were killed and more than 100 in­jured.</p>
    <p>Sawad­jaan was said to have been se­ri­ously wounded in a clash early last month and that his nephew, Mundi, was now call­ing the shots.</p>
    <p>Lt-Gen Sobe­jana said Sawad­jaan, who is al­ready in his 60s, was prob­a­bly al­ready dead. “I think the two women were mo­ti­vated by Mundi Sawad­jaan, us­ing the deaths of their hus­bands,” he said.</p>
