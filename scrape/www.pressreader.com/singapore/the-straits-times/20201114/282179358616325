    <p>I was re­cently in­volved in a mi­nor ac­ci­dent and a pri­vate set­tle­ment claim was made against me.</p>
    <p>The other car owner sent his ve­hi­cle to the au­tho­rised re­pair work­shop.</p>
    <p>The quo­ta­tion was an as­ton­ish­ing $17,000.</p>
    <p>The car owner was kind enough to get an­other quo­ta­tion from a pri­vate work­shop. This quo­ta­tion was less than a third of the au­tho­rised work­shop’s.</p>
    <p>I am piqued by the huge dif­fer­ence in the prices quoted by an au­tho­rised work­shop and a pri­vate work­shop.</p>
    <p>Yes, auto re­pair work­shops may mark up the prices of parts to make a profit to stay in busi­ness, but a mark-up of more than three times is mind-bog­gling, es­pe­cially for a mi­nor ac­ci­dent which left my car with only some scratches.</p>
    <p>Mak­ing use of a mi­nor ac­ci­dent to quote an ex­or­bi­tant re­pair price does not in­spire trust in the auto re­pair in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>This is a key rea­son be­hind the high car in­sur­ance pre­mi­ums that ve­hi­cle own­ers in Sin­ga­pore pay, even though most of them may not be in­volved in an ac­ci­dent through­out their lives.</p>
    <p>I hope all au­tho­rised car deal­ers make it their re­spon­si­bil­ity to as­sess the re­pair costs of their au­tho­rised work­shops.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve that if we can bring down the auto re­pair costs to rea­son­able lev­els, ve­hi­cle own­ers can pay lower car in­sur­ance pre­mi­ums. Foo Sing Kheng</p>
