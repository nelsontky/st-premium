    <p>Ru­dolph Valentino’s face caused sui­cides. Some fe­male votaries who had de­spaired of pos­sess­ing the ac­tor gave them­selves to death. They re­fused to live in a less hand­some world, con­signed to the com­pan­ion­ship of lesser Valenti­nos.</p>
    <p>The French philoso­pher</p>
    <p>Roland Barthes, who notes this phe­nom­e­non in his book, Mytholo­gies, com­ments also on Greta Garbo’s fea­tures.</p>
    <p>Like Au­drey Hep­burn’s, ac­tress Garbo’s face ex­udes a sin­gu­lar beauty. How­ever, Hep­burn’s face be­longs in the or­der of sub­stances, Garbo’s in that of con­cepts. Hep­burn’s face is an “Event”, while Garbo’s face is an “Idea”.</p>
    <p>Eu­ge­nio Gat­ti­nara trans­lates those cheem French thoughts into ev­ery­day English. Hep­burn’s face is “solid, well de­fined, like an event”, whereas Garbo’s face is “ethe­real, hard to de­fine, like an idea”.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic at­tests to the rel­e­vance of the dis­tinc­tion be­tween an event and an idea.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the on­set of the pan­demic, I used to at­tend con­fer­ences, di­a­logues and so on that were re­plete with Sin­ga­porean Hep­burns. They were vis­ually per­fect. The ge­o­met­ri­cal sym­me­try of their faces was Eu­clidean. Not an eye­lash was ever out of place. No nose sneezed: Per­ish the thought. Every smile re­vealed tooth­paste-per­fect teeth.</p>
    <p>At lunch, thin fin­gers placed the dory so del­i­cately in the mouth that I imag­ined the de­parted aquar­ian swim­ming in ex­is­ten­tial de­light and thank­ing the Cre­ator that it had not been de­voured by lesser, coarser mor­tals. A loud burp would have scat­tered those around the ta­ble. A louder one would have driven the ven­er­a­ble con­fer­ees from the room.</p>
    <p>That did not oc­cur. The gilded Hep­burns ex­uded the se­duc­tive scent of suc­cess. Ig­nor­ing the ple­beian wait­ers and wait­resses milling around the ta­bles, their eyes waltzed furtively from one cor­po­rate Valentino to the next in the en­chanted ball­room.</p>
    <p>Those Hep­burns be­longed in the or­der of the sub­stances that made up the aes­thetic econ­omy of Sin­ga­pore. They were beau­ti­ful crea­tures of cir­cum­stance, but not cre­ators of beauty. They were em­bed­ded in a mo­ment, en­chained to them­selves. They were events.</p>
    <p>The world has gone vir­tual now. I do not get to meet the Hep­burns any more. I re­mem­ber the Gar­bos in­stead. They are around today, some­where, some­how in­hab­it­ing the crevices of rocky ex­is­tence as the epi­demi­o­log­i­cal econ­omy washes over the shores of Sin­ga­pore. They are not em­bed­ded in pass­ing mo­ments. Rather, en­tire epochs are in­scribed in their pas­sage.</p>
    <p>The Gar­bos in­clude an el­derly woman who used to pick up cans and other dis­carded items in my neigh­bour­hood. Her face was so fa­mil­iar that its reg­u­lar ap­pear­ance be­came a part of my so­cial be­ing.</p>
    <p>To see her was to be re­minded of the aes­thete Roger Scru­ton writ­ing of the “beauty of an aged face, which has emerged, as it were, from a life of moral tri­als”.</p>
    <p>I do not know what moral tri­als she en­dured, but etched into the folds of her age­ing flesh was an en­tire his­tory of fem­i­nine Sin­ga­pore. That in­vis­i­bly tat­tooed his­tory stretched from the male ca­pit­u­la­tion to the Ja­panese Oc­cu­pa­tion to the hunger moth­ers bore so that their chil­dren could gain the strength to hope for lib­erty.</p>
    <p>I do not know whether she was mar­ried, what hap­pened to her hus­band or where their chil­dren might be today. With or with­out them, her eyes in­cor­po­rated the ex­is­tence of a mil­lion women. The eyes were so ra­di­ant that they made the world beau­ti­ful to be­hold. An idea in her­self, she trans­formed me into a gypsy peer of her realm.</p>
    <p>Then there was a fish­mon­ger’s wife. When I asked about her chil­dren, she con­fided with quiet pride that her sons ex­celled in their mother tongue at school. Her hus­band beamed. They were a beau­ti­ful cou­ple, but what made them so was the beauty of the minds that their phys­i­cal union had pro­duced. How can the chil­dren of par­ents with the same mother tongue not be good in the mother-fa­ther tongue?</p>
    <p>Their sons were hand­some, no doubt, but that was not the point. They were beau­ti­ful be­cause they had be­come ideas which drew from the plen­i­tude of cul­ture, the ul­ti­mate refuge of parental time.</p>
    <p>To meet these Sin­ga­pore­ans was to be re­minded of the Greek philoso­pher Her­a­cli­tus, who be­lieves that the world’s beauty is har­mo­nious but that it man­i­fests it­self in the ran­dom­ness of flux.</p>
    <p>Flux re­wards hu­mans some­times: It pun­ishes them more of­ten. The trick is to stay true to beauty in a dis­traught world.</p>
    <p>Flesh­ing out the re­la­tion­ship be­tween beauty and change, Czech nov­el­ist Mi­lan Kun­dera writes in The Un­bear­able Light­ness Of Be­ing: “With­out re­al­is­ing it, the in­di­vid­ual com­poses his life ac­cord­ing to the laws of beauty even in times of great­est dis­tress.”</p>
    <p>These are such times. I see the old woman oc­ca­sion­ally. The smile on her face be­lies what she could be go­ing through.</p>
    <p>I do not see the fish­mon­ger and his wife. They have not given up on the lan­guage of their chil­dren, I be­lieve. Why should they? Lan­guages are beau­ti­ful be­cause their gram­mar has sur­vived ugly pan­demics, famines and wars.</p>
    <p>As for today’s Valenti­nos, whose faces are events trans­formed into ideas by the im­pres­sion­able, they could re­buff ad­mir­ers by re­mind­ing them of the words of Ital­ian nov­el­ist Um­berto Eco. He places chanced en­coun­ters with beauty in the coy chastity of a sphere where “we en­joy some­thing for what it is, im­ma­te­rial of whether we pos­sess it or not”.</p>
    <p>We can­not pos­sess beauty. It must not cap­ture us.</p>
