    <p>Short of skilled work­ers, Glob­al­tronic Pre­ci­sion turned to au­to­ma­tion and has in­vested about $2.5 mil­lion since 2017.</p>
    <p>The move has also en­abled the Sin­ga­pore pre­ci­sion en­gi­neer­ing firm to run its pro­duc­tion lines round the clock.</p>
    <p>But like many small and medi­um­sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) in the in­dus­try, Glob­al­tronic found that tech­nol­ogy is not just a saviour amid a short­age of staff with the rel­e­vant skills.</p>
    <p>It has also low­ered the re­jec­tion rates in its pro­duc­tion out­put.</p>
    <p>These pos­i­tive out­comes are sig­nif­i­cant as the pre­ci­sion en­gi­neer­ing seg­ment is im­por­tant in that it im­proves man­u­fac­tur­ing pro­cesses and pro­vides sup­port for a wide range of in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>And de­spite the coron­avirus pan­demic, it has seen steady growth this year, ex­pand­ing 11.4 per cent year on year in the Jan­uary to July pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The over­all man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor, too, has been boom­ing.</p>
    <p>It recorded a 24.2 per cent jump in out­put last month, com­pared with Septem­ber last year, ac­cord­ing to Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board data re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Au­to­ma­tion al­lows lo­cal pre­ci­sion en­gi­neer­ing firms to con­tinue to ride this wave of growth.</p>
    <p>Glob­al­tronic has seen its rev­enue rise al­most 40 per cent since it added an au­to­ma­tion line serv­ing 13 com­puter nu­mer­i­cal con­trol ma­chines, while man­power has been freed up for other tasks, man­ag­ing direc­tor Han Chin Chuan told The Straits Times last week.</p>
    <p>“On top of that, our pro­duc­tion qual­ity has gone up. Ap­proval rates have in­creased from about 85 per cent to more than 98 per cent.”</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, Glob­al­tronic sent three of its work­ers for cour­ses on au­to­ma­tion and ro­bot­ics projects at Nanyang Polytech­nic.</p>
    <p>“With that knowl­edge, they are able to main­tain our au­to­ma­tion line. When the ma­chine has prob­lems, we now have peo­ple in-house who can fix it,” Mr Han said.</p>
    <p>Their new skills in de­sign­ing ma­chines and soft­ware also give them a sense of own­er­ship, he added.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar gains are be­ing reaped at Decor In­dus­tries, which spe­cialises in sur­face fin­ish­ing ser­vices.</p>
    <p>It has con­verted its fa­cil­ity into a smart fac­tory where the fully au­to­mated fin­ish­ing lines have a cen­tral con­trol and a dig­i­talised in­ven­tory</p>
    <p>man­age­ment sys­tem.</p>
    <p>When the equip­ment is fine­tuned to run at full speed in a month or two, pro­duc­tion is ex­pected to soar by 50 per cent, said chief mar­ket­ing of­fi­cer David Lim.</p>
    <p>“Au­to­mated lines re­duce our man­power work­load, but we are not re­mov­ing any of the work­ers,” he added.</p>
    <p>“We are send­ing them for job re­design­ing cour­ses and up­grad­ing their skill sets, and with their ex­pe­ri­ence, they can not only op­er­ate the sys­tem but also an­a­lyse things quicker, which means sav­ing time when we do trou­bleshoot­ing.”</p>
    <p>Glob­al­tronic, Decor and other pre­ci­sion en­gi­neer­ing firms have worked with iS­mart, a col­lab­o­ra­tion among in­dus­try ex­perts to help SMEs im­ple­ment dig­i­tal so­lu­tions to boost their op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Such col­lab­o­ra­tions tie in with gov­ern­ment agency JTC Cor­po­ra­tion’s In­dus­try Con­nect ini­tia­tive, which was launched ear­lier this year and has reached about 1,000 busi­nesses in JTC’s in­dus­trial es­tates.</p>
    <p>Decor’s Mr Lim said em­bark­ing on dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion is also to en­sure the firm con­tin­ues to se­cure projects from multi­na­tion­als.</p>
    <p>“In Sin­ga­pore, we are mov­ing up the tech­nol­ogy lad­der and we have both the crafts­man­ship and knowhow. Multi­na­tion­als ap­pre­ci­ate that, and they come to us to de­velop projects for them.”</p>
    <p>TIE-UPS BE­TWEEN MNCs AND LO­CAL SMEs</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, tech firm PD So­lu­tions teamed up with bev­er­age gi­ant Coca-Cola’s sub­sidiary Pa­cific Re­fresh­ments to au­to­mate the</p>
    <p>EM­PLOY­EES BEN­E­FIT</p>
    <p>sched­ul­ing of liq­uid con­cen­trates pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>The five-month project has seen Coca-Cola’s plant sig­nif­i­cantly shorten the process from one or two days to a mat­ter of min­utes.</p>
    <p>It has also raised pro­duc­tion vol­ume by about 10 per cent with­out adding more man­power, said Pa­cific Re­fresh­ments pro­duc­tion man­ager Dar­rel Pon.</p>
    <p>The col­lab­o­ra­tion was in part­ner­ship with the Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search’s (A*Star) Ad­vanced Re­man­u­fac­tur­ing and Tech­nol­ogy Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>A*Star has un­der­taken about 6,000 projects in the past five years. Of these, about 2,000 were with lo­cal en­ter­prises, 84 per cent of which were SMEs and start-ups.</p>
    <p>The projects typ­i­cally in­volve a prob­lem state­ment, put out by a</p>
    <p>multi­na­tional like Coca-Cola, that is then tack­led by an SME or start-up, cre­at­ing a win-win so­lu­tion for the var­i­ous par­ties, said A*Star as­sis­tant chief ex­ec­u­tive Al­fred Huan.</p>
    <p>“The rea­son for work­ing with SMEs is that they form the back­bone of the en­gi­neer­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties that we have,” he noted.</p>
    <p>PD So­lu­tions man­ag­ing direc­tor Tay Ming Hui said the col­lab­o­ra­tion also broad­ens the firm’s ex­per­tise in ar­eas be­yond its strengths in as­sem­bling fin­ished prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>“This is a good start for us to bet­ter un­der­stand process en­gi­neer­ing in­dus­tries like the food and bev­er­age space, and pre­pares us to deal with fu­ture prospects in sim­i­lar in­dus­tries, which open up new op­por­tu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>Au­to­mated lines re­duce our man­power work­load, but we are not re­mov­ing any of the work­ers. We are send­ing them for job re­design­ing cour­ses and up­grad­ing their skill sets, and with their ex­pe­ri­ence, they can not only op­er­ate the sys­tem but also an­a­lyse things quicker, which means sav­ing time when we do trou­bleshoot­ing.</p>
