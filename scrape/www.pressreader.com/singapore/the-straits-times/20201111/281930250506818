    <p>Hun­dreds of Rus­sian peace­keep­ers were be­ing de­ployed to Nagorno-Karabakh yes­ter­day af­ter Ar­me­nia and Azer­bai­jan agreed to a peace deal to end weeks of fight­ing over the dis­puted re­gion.</p>
    <p>The Moscow-bro­kered agree­ment, which saw a cease­fire take ef­fect at 1am lo­cal time, came af­ter a string of Azer­bai­jani vic­to­ries in its fight to re­take the eth­nic Ar­me­nian en­clave.</p>
    <p>The deal sparked cel­e­bra­tions in Azer­bai­jan but fury in Ar­me­nia, where pro­test­ers took to the streets to de­nounce the coun­try’s lead­er­ship for losses in the ter­ri­tory, which broke from Azer­bai­jan’s con­trol dur­ing a war in the early 1990s.</p>
    <p>Ar­me­nian Prime Min­is­ter Nikol Pashinyan, Azer­bai­jani Pres­i­dent Il­ham Aliyev and Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin an­nounced the deal in the early hours of yes­ter­day. Mr Pashinyan de­scribed the agree­ment as “un­speak­ably pain­ful for me and for our peo­ple”, while Mr Aliyev said it amounted to a “ca­pit­u­la­tion”.</p>
    <p>The full text of the deal was re­leased sev­eral hours later and showed clear gains for Azer­bai­jan. Its forces will re­tain con­trol over ar­eas seized in the fight­ing, in­clud­ing the key town of Shusha, while Ar­me­nia agreed to a timetable to with­draw from l arge parts of Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>
    <p>A Rus­sian force of 1,960 mil­i­tary per­son­nel and 90 ar­moured per­son­nel car­ri­ers will be sent to the re­gion as peace­keep­ers, for a re­new­able five-year mis­sion. The Rus­sian De­fence Min­istry yes­ter­day said 10 IL-76 air­craft car­ry­ing the first peace­keep­ers and their equip­ment had taken off from an air­field in Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>Mr Aliyev said that Turkey, a key ally, would also be in­volved in peace­keep­ing ef­forts, but there was no men­tion of it in the agree­ment.</p>
    <p>Ar­me­nian De­fence Min­istry spokesman Shushan Stepa­nyan said on Twit­ter that the sit­u­a­tion was calm in the re­gion at 6am lo­cal time and that “com­bat op­er­a­tions on the whole front line are sus­pended”.</p>
    <p>The con­flict over the ter­ri­tory that has sim­mered for decades – de­spite in­ter­na­tional ef­forts to reach an ac­cord – erupted into fresh fight­ing in late Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>More than 1,400 peo­ple have been con­firmed killed, in­clud­ing dozens of civil­ians, but the ac­tual death toll is be­lieved to be sig­nif­i­cantly higher.</p>
    <p>Azer­bai­jani forces made steady gains over the weeks of fight­ing, sweep­ing across the south­ern flank of the re­gion and even­tu­ally into its heart­land. A turn­ing point came on Sun­day when Mr Aliyev an­nounced that his forces had cap­tured Shusha, the re­gion’s strate­gi­cally vi­tal sec­ond-largest town.</p>
    <p>Shusha sits on cliffs over­look­ing NagornoKar­abakh’s main city, Stepanaker­t, and on the main road to Ar­me­nia, which backs the sep­a­ratists.</p>
    <p>Karabakh de­clared in­de­pen­dence nearly 30 years ago but the dec­la­ra­tion has not been recog­nised in­ter­na­tion­ally, even by Ar­me­nia, and it re­mains a part of Azer­bai­jan un­der in­ter­na­tional law.</p>
