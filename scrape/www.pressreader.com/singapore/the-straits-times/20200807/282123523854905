    <p>DBS Bank has been in­creas­ing its dig­i­tal trans­ac­tions and mar­ket share over the past few months, said group chief ex­ec­u­tive Piyush Gupta yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the re­lease of the bank’s sec­ond-quar­ter fi­nan­cial re­sults, he added that the bank “has been ahead of the game” in terms of its dig­i­tal of­fer­ings.</p>
    <p>South-east Asia’s largest bank re­ported a 22 per cent fall in net profit to $1.2 bil­lion as it sets aside more money for loan pro­vi­sions.</p>
    <p>This is down from $1.6 bil­lion a year ago, nar­rowly beat­ing the $1.19 bil­lion av­er­age es­ti­mate of eight an­a­lysts sur­veyed by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>The bank’s net profit for the first half of this year was $2.4 bil­lion, down 26 per cent from $3.3 bil­lion a year ago. The net in­ter­est mar­gin – a key gauge for bank prof­itabil­ity – be­tween April and June was 1.62 per cent, down from 1.91 per cent a year ago.</p>
    <p>The bank ex­pects the full-year net in­ter­est mar­gin to dip fur­ther, com­ing in at 1.6 per cent. Its net in­ter­est mar­gin last year was 1.89 per cent.</p>
    <p>Net in­ter­est mar­gin mea­sures the dif­fer­ence be­tween in­come earned from loans and the in­ter­est paid to de­pos­i­tors.</p>
    <p>Talk­ing about the op­por­tu­ni­ties of­fered by dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and the bank’s dig­i­tal of­fer­ings, Mr Gupta said: “(Dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion) cre­ates an op­por­tu­nity for many new in­comegen­er­at­ing busi­nesses. We are ac­tively work­ing on sev­eral other things we could do in the dig­i­tal space as economies and sec­tors are mor­ph­ing to a new way of think­ing.”</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has turbo-charged dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion pro­cesses as progress that would nor­mally take five to 10 years has been achieved in three months, Mr Gupta said.</p>
    <p>“The way peo­ple will con­sume tech... the way peo­ple pro­duce and where they need to work from (will) change,” he added.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, Mr Gupta had iden­ti­fied how sup­ply chains would be chang­ing due to ten­sions be­tween the United States and China, al­beit at a pace “far more gla­cial than what a lot of peo­ple think”.</p>
    <p>In­come in­equal­ity and so­cial is­sues are also go­ing to be at the fore­front of many po­lit­i­cal de­bates, he said.</p>
    <p>He also ex­pects the cur­rent low in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment to last for “much, much longer”.</p>
    <p>He said the bank had de­liv­ered “a strong op­er­at­ing per­for­mance amidst se­vere macroe­co­nomic head­winds”.</p>
    <p>This was a tough quar­ter due to in­ter­est rate cuts and lock­downs in most coun­tries where the bank is op­er­a­tional, he said, adding that eco­nomic and con­sumer ac­tiv­i­ties have slowed down as a re­sult.</p>
    <p>In March, the US Fed­eral Re­serve cut in­ter­est rates, aim­ing for a tar­get range of zero per cent to 0.25 per cent in a move to shore up the world’s largest econ­omy amid the pandemic.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies tend to want to bor­row more money when in­ter­est rates are low, but the yield on those loans is low for the banks.</p>
    <p>“That’s not an easy en­vi­ron­ment to op­er­ate in,” said Mr Gupta.</p>
    <p>The bank, how­ever, ex­pects de­posit in­flows into cur­rent and sav­ings ac­counts to con­tinue, build­ing on strong growth in the first six months of this year.</p>
    <p>The eas­ing of lock­downs is also ex­pected to im­prove sev­eral fee in­come streams, such as cards and ban­cas­sur­ance, wealth man­age­ment in­vest­ment and in­vest­ment bank­ing, Mr Gupta said.</p>
    <p>“Mar­ket con­di­tions re­main con­ducive for trea­sury mar­kets in­come and for cus­tomer flows,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Notwith­stand­ing the un­cer­tain­ties, we are in a good po­si­tion to con­tinue sup­port­ing cus­tomers and the com­mu­nity through the dif­fi­cult months ahead of us.”</p>
