    <p>Western food chains As­tons and Collin’s be­gan in hawker cen­tres or cof­fee shops, and Mr Lee Syafiq hopes his burger out­lets will be the next hawker brand to make it big.</p>
    <p>He opened the first Ashes Burn­nit stall at Golden Mile Food Cen­tre last year, and two more since then, with each out­let sell­ing about 500 burg­ers a day.</p>
    <p>While not a house­hold name yet, like Malaysia’s Ramly burger, Ashes Burn­nit is fast ac­quir­ing a loyal cus­tomer base for both its af­ford­abil­ity and its crusty pat­ties.</p>
    <p>“Burger chains were not com­mon in hawker cen­tres when I started, and they be­came a trend only later,” said Mr Lee, 28.</p>
    <p>“In the next five years, hawker cen­tres will not be what you see to­day. Food will be more in­ter­na­tional and store­fronts will be more unique. Right now, you can’t re­ally tell the dif­fer­ence be­tween the stores.”</p>
    <p>At the out­let in Alexan­dra Vil­lage Food Cen­tre, Ashes Burn­nit stands out for its neon-lit store­front, which is reg­u­larly tagged on so­cial me­dia plat­forms like In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>Char­coal buns are the de­fault choice for the burg­ers, which Mr Lee said ini­tially faced some re­sis­tance from cus­tomers, es­pe­cially those from the older gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“As I see it, it’s also about con­sumer ed­u­ca­tion. Af­ter serv­ing char­coal buns for a year, 90 per cent now want char­coal buns.</p>
    <p>“You can see the shift in con­sumers’ ap­pre­ci­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lee is among a gen­er­a­tion of younger hawk­ers who are look­ing to make waves in Sin­ga­pore’s hawker cul­ture, al­most forc­ing it to evolve with the times.</p>
    <p>He fiercely be­lieves that there is much scope for older and younger hawk­ers to learn from each other. They have asked him for help with us­ing apps, while he learns from their stall man­age­ment ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>And Mr Lee is al­ready men­tor­ing oth­ers who are newer to the hawker trade.</p>
    <p>Foot­ball coach Ab­dul Faris, 30, is ap­pren­tic­ing at Ashes Burn­nit for two months. He hopes to go on to open his own Western food hawker stall.</p>
    <p>Mr Ab­dul’s mother used to be a hawker sell­ing Malay food, and her pas­sion for it rubbed off on him. He la­bels him­self a foodie, and said he wants hawker cen­tres to be more ex­pe­ri­en­tial to at­tract young peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple will then hawker cen­tre-hop, like how they now cafe­hop,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It is im­por­tant to keep these cen­tres alive as they bring to­gether all kinds of cui­sine and peo­ple of all eth­nic­i­ties un­der one roof. With more young peo­ple join­ing the trade, hope­fully oth­ers will see this as a pos­si­ble path for them.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said he hopes to see the pro­fes­sion of hawker up in neon lights one day, hav­ing the same pres­tige value as a di­rec­tor or an ac­coun­tant.</p>
    <p>He added: “Peo­ple will also have to start pay­ing for what they get in terms of food qual­ity.</p>
    <p>“Con­sumers have a part to play in groom­ing the fu­ture gen­er­a­tion of young hawk­ers.”</p>
