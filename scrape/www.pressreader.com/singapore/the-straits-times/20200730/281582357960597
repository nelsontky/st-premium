    <p>In­done­sian tourism hot spot Bali will re­open to do­mes­tic tourists to­mor­row. How­ever, this will be un­der a host of strict pro­to­cols that in­clude vis­i­tors hav­ing to fur­nish proof that they have tested neg­a­tive for the coron­avirus.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia’s tourism hot spot Bali is­land will re­open to do­mes­tic tourists to­mor­row, but un­der a host of strict pro­to­cols that in­clude vis­i­tors show­ing proof they tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment comes as the prov­ince tries to re­vive its badly-hit econ­omy even as new in­fec­tions con­tinue to rise.</p>
    <p>Mr I. Putu Astawa, head of Bali’s tourism agency, told The Straits Times that care has been taken as the prov­ince seeks to strike a bal­ance be­tween its eco­nomic and health in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>“The most im­por­tant thing is to pre­vent the re­open­ing from cre­at­ing a new epi­cen­tre of trans­mis­sion, so this is a very tough de­ci­sion to make,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that the sit­u­a­tion on the is­land is “un­der con­trol”, cit­ing the re­cov­ery rate of around 75 per cent among Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the prov­ince saw 61 fresh cases, bring­ing total in­fec­tions to 3,310, with deaths re­main­ing at 48, the fig­ure since July 23.</p>
    <p>Apart from need­ing to present an­ti­body test re­sults show­ing no Covid-19 in­fec­tion, vis­i­tors will also have to ob­serve “strict health pro­to­cols”, such as safe dis­tanc­ing, tem­per­a­ture-tak­ing and mask-wear­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Putu said tourism sites must op­er­ate at be­low full ca­pac­ity and its work­ers may have to put on ad­di­tional pro­tec­tive equip­ment such as face shields and gloves.</p>
    <p>The oc­cu­pancy rate of ho­tels in Bali nose­dived to 2.07 per cent in May, from 51.56 per cent in the same month last year and 62.55 per cent in De­cem­ber be­fore the out­break.</p>
    <p>The re­sort is­land which closed tourism sites in late March has grad­u­ally re­opened them since July 9 for Bali res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>It has set a goal of wel­com­ing for­eign tourists on Sept 11, but Mr Putu said this is still “sub­ject to ap­proval from the na­tional gov­ern­ment”.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts have crit­i­cised the move by In­done­sia to ease so­cial re­stric­tions. They said the pre­ma­ture lift­ing of a par­tial lock­down in some re­gions last month had al­ready caused cases to climb and pre­dict this will last un­til at least Septem­ber with­out stronger in­ter­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>Na­tion­wide, the over­all num­ber of cases to­talled 104,432, while deaths reached 4,975 as of yes­ter­day. Both fig­ures are the high­est in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Dr I. Wayan Gede Artawan Eka</p>
    <p>Pu­tra, an epi­demi­ol­o­gist at Bal­ibased Udayana Univer­sity, said that while he saw no is­sue with the re­open­ing as long as strict mea­sures are taken, what could throw a span­ner in the works is the prov­ince’s re­liance on an­ti­body tests.</p>
    <p>Ac­cu­rate de­tec­tion of Covid-19 can only be achieved with poly­merase chain re­ac­tion tests, he said.</p>
    <p>Dr I. Gusti Agung Ngu­rah Anom, chair­man of the Bali chap­ter of the In­done­sian Hos­pi­tal As­so­ci­a­tion, said hos­pi­tals will be able to cope, with more beds be­ing made avail­able for Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Tourism-re­lated busi­nesses said they are ready to com­ply with the health pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>Mr Hariyadi Sukam­dani, chair­man of In­done­sian Ho­tel and Restau­rant As­so­ci­a­tion, said that ho­tels and restau­rants in Bali will en­sure that they ad­here to pro­to­cols such as main­tain­ing a dis­tance of at least 1m be­tween cus­tomers and hav­ing staff wear masks and gloves when serv­ing guests.</p>
    <p>“There will be no com­pro­mise in im­ple­ment­ing the health pro­to­cols. It’s a must,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr I. Ke­tut Ar­dana, chair­man of the Bali chap­ter of the In­done­sian Tour and Travel Agency As­so­ci­a­tion, said busi­nesses have been ob­serv­ing the pro­to­cols so far and he is con­fi­dent they will con­tinue to do so. “We are used to pri­ori­tis­ing clean­li­ness, health and safety. We only need to re­in­force them fur­ther.”</p>
