    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO • A few weeks ago, Brooks Koepka’s chances of win­ning a record third con­sec­u­tive PGA Cham­pi­onship looked to be fad­ing af­ter a string of poor re­sults and a re­cur­rence of his nig­gling left knee in­jury.</p>
    <p>But the big man from Jupiter, Florida tends to lift off when the Ma­jors come into or­bit, and his tied sec­ond place in Mem­phis at the WGCSt Jude In­vi­ta­tional last Sun­day was a typ­i­cal, timely re­turn to form.</p>
    <p>“I feel like my game’s right there. This is where we wanted to be, peak­ing for the PGA (Cham­pi­onship),” he said, hav­ing reg­is­tered one top-25 fin­ish in 10 prior starts.</p>
    <p>“I feel like my game’s right there, ev­ery­thing’s solid.”</p>
    <p>No player has won the PGA Cham­pi­onship, the first Ma­jor of a dis­rupted year, three suc­ces­sive times since it be­came a stroke play event in 1958. The late Wal­ter Ha­gen is the only player to have ever achieved the “three-peat”, but Koepka’s record of shin­ing on the big­gest stage – four of his seven PGA Tour ca­reer wins have been Ma­jors – can­not be dis­counted.</p>
    <p>The book­mak­ers have made him joint favourite along­side new world No. 1 and fel­low Amer­i­can Justin</p>
    <p>Thomas ahead of to­mor­row’s tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>Thomas, who usurped Spain’s Jon Rahm af­ter beat­ing Koepka to the WGC-St Jude ti­tle, will be chas­ing a sec­ond PGA Cham­pi­onship to go with his 2017 crown this week at TPC Hard­ing Park.</p>
    <p>His vet­eran stand-in cad­die also has the chance of an un­ex­pected sec­ond ti­tle of his own. Jim Mackay cad­died for Phil Mick­el­son for 25 years, and was on the bag when “Lefty” won the 2005 PGA Cham­pi­onship at Bal­tus­rol, New Jersey.</p>
    <p>“Bones” parted ways am­i­ca­bly with the five-time Ma­jor win­ner in 2017 and picked up Thomas’ bag for a tour­na­ment in Hawaii 2018 when his reg­u­lar cad­die Jimmy John­son was in­jured. He again an­swered the call last week when</p>
    <p>John­son fell sick and the pair gelled in­stantly, with Thomas sweep­ing to vic­tory in Mem­phis. A sec­ond PGA Cham­pi­onship for both would cap a fairy-tale fort­night.</p>
    <p>“I hon­estly was 50-50 on think­ing if it would work out with this short no­tice,” said the 13-time Tour win­ner. “I was very lucky.”</p>
    <p>Fif­teen-time Ma­jor cham­pion Tiger Woods, who will be play­ing only his sec­ond Tour event since Fe­bru­ary’s Ge­n­e­sis In­vi­ta­tional, will be an­other to watch along­side Jor­dan Spi­eth. Spi­eth’s drought dates back to his 2017 Open Cham­pi­onship tri­umph, but the for­mer world No. 1 can this week be­come just the sixth player in his­tory to se­cure the ca­reer Grand Slam by win­ning all four Ma­jors.</p>
    <p>Like Koepka, the Amer­i­can tends to save his best for when it re­ally counts and he has been in rel­a­tively con­sis­tent form, with just one missed cut since the Tour’s restart in June.</p>
    <p>To­mor­row’s field will be miss­ing the likes of English­man Lee West­wood, Ire­land’s Padraig Har­ring­ton and Ital­ian Francesco Moli­nari, all of whom have de­cided not to play, while South African Bran­den Grace had to pull out due to a pos­i­tive Covid-19 test last week­end.</p>
    <p>Two-time Ma­jor cham­pion John Daly will also be ab­sent due to fears over the virus. The Amer­i­can, who has bat­tled weight and drug and al­co­hol de­pen­dency is­sues, tweeted: “Cal­i­for­nia now #1 in cases/deaths, I had knee surgery, I’m a di­a­betic and I don’t feel com­fort­able fly­ing.”</p>
