    <p>Trans­port op­er­a­tor SBS Tran­sit posted a 27.4 per cent drop in first-half net earn­ings to $32.6 mil­lion as there were fewer peo­ple com­mut­ing dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Com­fortDelGro sub­sidiary said that with­out gov­ern­ment relief, it would have in­curred an op­er­at­ing loss of $29.4 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue was down 14.9 per cent to $603.2 mil­lion for the six months ended June 30, as cir­cuit breaker mea­sures from April to June to curb the spread of the virus brought pub­lic trans­port rid­er­ship down by as much as 80 per cent.</p>
    <p>Even after the mea­sures were eased on June 2, rid­er­ship re­mained at around half of what it used to be be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>SBS Tran­sit’s op­er­at­ing ex­penses were 12.5 per cent lower at $571 mil­lion, with fuel and elec­tric­ity cost see­ing the big­gest drop – of 46.6 per cent to $47.6 mil­lion – as fewer bus and train runs were made dur­ing the stay-home pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Even staff cost, usu­ally on an up­trend, fell 16.8 per cent to $295.9 mil­lion be­cause driv­ers clocked lit­tle or no over­time dur­ing the pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The bus and train op­er­a­tor’s earn­ings per share fell from 14.39 cents to 10.45 cents. Its tan­gi­ble as­set per share stood at $1.73, from $1.69 as of Dec 31 last year.</p>
    <p>The trans­port op­er­a­tor said profit in the first half “was largely lifted by gov­ern­ment grants of $61.6 mil­lion”.</p>
    <p>It said that for the six months, av­er­age rail rid­er­ship fell by more than 40 per cent for the MRT and more than 30 per cent for the LRT.</p>
    <p>This was par­tially off­set by av­er­age fares, which were 14.7 per cent higher for the Down­town Line, 16.6 per cent higher for the North East Line (NEL), and 8.7 per cent higher for the Sengkang-Pung­gol LRT.</p>
    <p>But SBS Tran­sit re­mained in a strong cash po­si­tion. As of June 30, it had short-term de­posits and bank bal­ances of $94.5 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>After ac­count­ing for bor­row­ings of $75 mil­lion, it was in a net cash po­si­tion of $19.5 mil­lion.</p>
