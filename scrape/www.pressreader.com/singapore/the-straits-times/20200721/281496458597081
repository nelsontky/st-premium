    <p>In­dus­trial land­lord JTC Cor­po­ra­tion has launched a ten­der to help com­pa­nies adopt so­lar en­ergy and make its in­dus­trial es­tates more en­vi­ron­men­tally friendly.</p>
    <p>This ini­tia­tive aims to fast-track so­lar power adop­tion on the rooftops of 50 JTC build­ings as well as those of JTC’s lessees, span­ning about 18ha.</p>
    <p>It is ex­pected to cre­ate 15 megawatt-peak (MWp) of so­lar de­ploy­ment by 2022.</p>
    <p>Un­der this new model, busi­nesses can ei­ther lease so­lar pho­to­voltaic pan­els and get a dis­count of about 15 per cent on the elec­tric­ity gen­er­ated, or lease out part of their rooftop space for so­lar ven­dors to in­stall so­lar pan­els, re­ceiv­ing rev­enue in re­turn.</p>
    <p>The So­larRoof ten­der was launched last Tues­day, is ex­pected to close on Aug 18, and is slated to be awarded in De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>It seeks to mit­i­gate some of the chal­lenges com­pa­nies face in switch­ing to cleaner sources of en­ergy, such as a lack of un­der­stand­ing of so­lar de­ploy­ment mod­els and le­gal and pro­cure­ment pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>The ten­der also in­cludes an op­tion for so­lar ven­dors to sug­gest other ideas, such as com­bin­ing so­lar de­ploy­ment with rooftop farm­ing.</p>
    <p>So­lar ven­dors who could take part in the ten­der in­clude ex­ist­ing play­ers such as Sun­seap, Sem­b­corp, Kep­pel, Sun Elec­tric and Ter­renus.</p>
    <p>Out­lin­ing the so­lar busi­ness mod­els avail­able in the mar­ket – di­rect own­er­ship, so­lar leas­ing and roof leas­ing – JTC group di­rec­tor of en­gi­neer­ing Calvin Chung said the so­lar leas­ing model in­cluded in the So­larRoof ten­der meets com­pa­nies’ needs bet­ter than di­rect own­er­ship, as no upfront cap­i­tal outlay is re­quired.</p>
    <p>There is also no cap­i­tal cost borne by the gov­ern­ment agency, he added.</p>
    <p>“The so­lar com­pany will gen­er­ate rev­enue from sell­ing power to the na­tional power grid, and our cus­tomers also get to earn some rental or en­joy dis­count for their power, de­pend­ing on which scheme they choose,” he said.</p>
    <p>JTC has re­ceived in­ter­est from some cus­tomers lo­cated in its in­dus­trial es­tates, such as Sele­tar Aero­space Park, Tuas Bio­med­i­cal Park, its own wafer fab­ri­ca­tion parks and one-north, Mr Chung added.</p>
    <p>Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal gi­ant Glax­oSmithK­line and de­vel­oper Ho Bee Land are among th­ese po­ten­tial clients.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, the agency has de­ployed so­lar pan­els on tem­po­rar­ily va­cant land on Jurong Is­land and on the roofs of more than 20 build­ings, in­clud­ing Jurong Town Hall and JTC Space @ Gul, amount­ing to more than 10MWp of in­stalled so­lar ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>It ex­pects to in­crease this so­lar ca­pac­ity to 100MWp within the next three years through So­larRoof and So­larLand, an ini­tia­tive that uses va­cant land for so­lar de­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>This would be enough to power more than 17,500 house­holds a year and re­duce car­bon emis­sions by more than 39,000 tonnes, JTC said.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral of JTC’s lessees have de­ployed so­lar ca­pac­ity on their own in the past few years, which has con­trib­uted to cost sav­ings.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, sus­tain­able pack­ag­ing com­pany Green­pac spent about $1 mil­lion to in­stall so­lar pan­els on the rooftop of its build­ing in 2011.</p>
    <p>So­lar en­ergy now pow­ers about half of the com­pany’s over­all op­er­a­tions and has helped it save close to $100,000 a year in en­ergy costs, Green­pac chief ex­ec­u­tive Su­san Chong said.</p>
    <p>Dr Toshiharu Shimizu, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of South-east Asia and In­dia for man­u­fac­tur­ing com­pany Ya­mazaki Mazak Sin­ga­pore, said de­ploy­ing a so­lar en­ergy sys­tem has en­abled the firm to re­duce both its car­bon diox­ide emis­sions and op­er­at­ing costs.</p>
    <p>“The shade that the pan­els pro­vide to the roof nat­u­rally helps to re­duce the tem­per­a­ture of the fully air-con­di­tioned fac­tory, thereby help­ing cut down on the plant’s en­ergy con­sump­tion,” he added.</p>
