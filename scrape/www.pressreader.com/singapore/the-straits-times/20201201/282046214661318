    <p>Work to pre­pare for next year’s gov­ern­ment Bud­get has be­gun, with Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat and rep­re­sen­ta­tives from sev­eral agen­cies and in­vest­ment en­ti­ties brief­ing Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob and the Coun­cil of Pres­i­den­tial Ad­vis­ers yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Bud­get is tra­di­tion­ally pre­sented in Par­lia­ment for de­bate in</p>
    <p>Fe­bru­ary, but prepa­ra­tion and con­sul­ta­tion usu­ally be­gin sev­eral months ear­lier.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post, Madam Hal­imah noted that yes­ter­day’s dis­cus­sions cen­tred on Covid-19 and its im­pact.</p>
    <p>Apart from the near-term un­cer­tain­ties brought on by the pan­demic, she noted that a key ques­tion is also whether Covid-19 has fun­da­men­tally changed the in­vest­ment land­scape.</p>
    <p>Other key ques­tions Madam Hal­imah said needed to be stud­ied are the struc­tural shifts that Covid-19 has caused to the macroe­co­nomic en­vi­ron­ment, and how th­ese fac­tors im­pact Sin­ga­pore’s long-term in­vest­ment re­turns.</p>
    <p>“We need a good han­dle on th­ese is­sues, as we are ef­fec­tively spend­ing from our re­serves based on th­ese as­sump­tions,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese are tough ques­tions that we need to grapple with. There are no easy an­swers, but it is my re­spon­si­bil­ity as cus­to­dian of Sin­ga­pore’s past re­serves to raise them for dis­cus­sion.</p>
    <p>“I am glad that the Gov­ern­ment has also been think­ing hard about th­ese same is­sues.”</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah was briefed by Mr Heng as well as rep­re­sen­ta­tives from the Min­istry of Fi­nance (MOF), the Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS), Sin­ga­pore sovereign wealth fund GIC and in­vest­ment firm Te­masek on their longterm macroe­co­nomic out­look and the Gov­ern­ment’s pro­posed ex­pected long-term real rates of re­turn.</p>
    <p>The in­vest­ment en­ti­ties had ear­lier dis­cussed for­ward pro­jec­tions of the re­turns with their re­spec­tive boards, and MOF has re­viewed th­ese pro­jec­tions, said Madam Hal­imah. “With my con­cur­rence, Gov­ern­ment can later ap­ply th­ese rates to rel­e­vant as­sets, to de­rive the net in­vest­ment re­turn con­tri­bu­tion (NIRC) for use in Bud­get 2021.”</p>
    <p>The net in­vest­ment re­turns frame­work al­lows the Gov­ern­ment to spend up to 50 per cent of the ex­pected long-term in­vest­ment re­turns gen­er­ated by Te­masek, GIC and MAS – the three en­ti­ties tasked to man­age Sin­ga­pore’s re­serves.</p>
    <p>The NIRC is the top con­trib­u­tor to the gov­ern­ment cof­fers.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng told Par­lia­ment in Oc­to­ber that the de­sign of the frame­work al­lows for a sta­ble, sus­tain­able source of in­come for the Bud­get, smoothed out over mar­ket cy­cles.</p>
