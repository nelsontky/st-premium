    <p>PARIS • French Open of­fi­cials are hop­ing an ex­emp­tion from the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties would en­able them to wel­come 5,000 fans each day amid new gov­ern­ment re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>The French gov­ern­ment has lim­ited public gath­er­ings to 1,000 peo­ple in Paris as part of mea­sures to con­trol the coronaviru­s pan­demic, rais­ing the prospect that the year’s fi­nal Grand Slam ten­nis tour­na­ment, which starts on Sun­day in Paris, will have to fur­ther re­duce the num­ber of fans al­lowed.</p>
    <p>French ten­nis chiefs had low­ered spec­ta­tor ca­pac­ity to 5,000 from 11,500. The orig­i­nal plan was to have 20,000 fans.</p>
    <p>“Today, we are at 5,000 peo­ple, which is very lit­tle in a 12-hectare site, which rep­re­sents 15 foot­ball fields,” tour­na­ment direc­tor Guy For­get told French ca­ble chan­nel BFM TV. “In terms of safety pro­to­cols, we meet all the cri­te­ria.”</p>
    <p>Al­lo­cated seat­ing will be avail­able in the main Philippe Cha­trier court.</p>
    <p>“Today, it is more risky to go to a su­per­mar­ket, to an am­phithe­atre and to take the metro,” the former world No. 4 added yes­ter­day. “We hope we will be able to wel­come fans to the French sport­ing event with the most in­ter­na­tional reach, by any mea­sure.”</p>
    <p>France has re­ported over 481,000 coronaviru­s cases and more than 31,400 deaths. In Paris, the in­fec­tion rate is higher than 150 cases per 100,000 in­hab­i­tants.</p>
    <p>Six play­ers in the qual­i­fy­ing draw were with­drawn af­ter ei­ther test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19 or com­ing in close con­tact with a coach who tested pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Henri Le­conte has backed the French Ten­nis Fed­er­a­tion’s de­ci­sion to al­low fans to at­tend the tour­na­ment. “It’s much better with crowds com­ing,” the last French­man to con­test a Roland Gar­ros fi­nal, when he was de­feated by Mats Wi­lan­der in 1988, told Sky Sports.</p>
    <p>Record 12-time winner Rafael Nadal will be­gin his at­tempt to equal Roger Fed­erer’s 20 Grand Slam ti­tles against Be­larus’ Egor Gerasi­mov. Top seed No­vak Djokovic faces Swede Mikael Ymer in the open­ing round.</p>
    <p>In the women’s draw, Ser­ena Wil­liams launches her bid for a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam sin­gles crown against fel­low Amer­i­can Kristie Ahn. Top seed Si­mona Halep, in the same half, takes on Spain’s Sara Sor­ribes Tormo.</p>
