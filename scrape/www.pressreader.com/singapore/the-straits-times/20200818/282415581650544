    <p>LON­DON • Alan Shearer did not cover him­self in glory the last and only time he was in the dugout, fail­ing to save New­cas­tle from rel­e­ga­tion as they went down in the 2008-09 English Premier League sea­son.</p>
    <p>The former Eng­land and New­cas­tle striker was the in­terim man­ager for only two months un­til the end of that cam­paign and has not been in any coach­ing ca­pac­ity since, work­ing as a TV pun­dit in­stead.</p>
    <p>But Shearer has re­port­edly been tapped to be New­cas­tle boss, this time on a full-time ba­sis, if the takeover by Bel­la­graph Nova Group goes through.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean en­trepreneur­s Ter­ence Loh and Nel­son Loh, along­side China-born Evan­ge­line Shen, are the co-founders of the Paris­based firm, which is said to be worth an es­ti­mated US$12 bil­lion (S$15.6 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>The group, which spans over 30 en­ti­ties across 100 coun­tries in fields like finance, sports, health­care, lux­ury goods, en­ter­tain­ment and ro­bot­ics, is in ne­go­ti­a­tions to buy out New­cas­tle, fol­low­ing the col­lapse of a Saudi Ara­bia-led £300 mil­lion (S$538.2 mil­lion) of­fer last month.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a Sun­day re­port by Bri­tish tabloid The Sun, Bel­la­graph Nova wants Shearer – the club’s record scorer with 206 goals – to take up the hot seat at St James’</p>
    <p>Net worth (US$12 bil­lion) of the Bel­la­graph Nova Group.</p>
    <p>Park. A source said: “We have of­fered Alan the man­ager’s po­si­tion, or what­ever he would like to do in the club. He has al­ready ac­cepted to work with us if our takeover goes through.”</p>
    <p>While the 50-year-old did not com­ment on the spec­u­la­tion, lo­cal daily The Chron­i­cle yes­ter­day said that it is “un­likely he would take the role”, given his friend­ship with cur­rent Mag­pies man­ager Steve Bruce.</p>
    <p>Shearer is not the only one Bel­la­graph Nova has iden­ti­fied to take up a lead­ing role should the bid be ac­cepted, with the Chron­i­cle yes­ter­day re­port­ing it in­tends to make Shen its chair­man.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it added the group and cur­rent owner Mike Ash­ley remain apart on the sell­ing price, with the Sports Di­rect founder stick­ing to his £350 mil­lion valu­a­tion.</p>
    <p>If the bid gets the green light, the Lohs will be the first Sin­ga­pore­ans to own an English top-flight club.</p>
