    <p>A 33-year-old man and a 24-yearold wo­man were charged yes­ter­day with the mur­der of the wo­man’s four-year-old daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>Wong Shi Xiang and Foo Li Ping were ac­cused of killing Me­gan Khung Yu Wai at a unit at Suites @ Guille­mard, a con­do­minium in Paya Le­bar, some­time in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Foo is Me­gan’s bi­o­log­i­cal mother, ac­cord­ing to a po­lice state­ment yes­ter­day. The girl was be­lieved to be an only child.</p>
    <p>Wong and Foo – as well as another wo­man, Nou­velle Chua Ru­oshi, 30 – have also been charged with dis­pos­ing the body of the girl to hide what hap­pened to her.</p>
    <p>They were said to have in­ten­tion­ally dis­posed her body by trans­port­ing it to Paya Ubi In­dus­trial Park and burn­ing it in a metal bar­rel.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments did not re­veal de­tails about the link be­tween the man and the two women.</p>
    <p>But The Sun­day Times un­der­stands that Wong and Foo are a cou­ple and Chua is their friend.</p>
    <p>The po­lice had ear­lier said that they re­ceived a re­port last Mon­day at 5.36pm that the four-year-old girl had gone miss­ing. They es­tab­lished that the girl had died and iden­ti­fied the three sus­pects.</p>
    <p>While it is un­clear when Wong and Foo were ar­rested, it is be­lieved that Chua was ar­rested last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Wong, Foo and Chua will be re­manded at Cen­tral Po­lice Di­vi­sion and their cases have been ad­journed to Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Wong used to work in a car ser­vic­ing work­shop in the Ubi in­dus­trial park where the girl’s body is said to have been burned, Chi­nese-lan­guage pa­per Lianhe Wan­bao re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The owner of the work­shop told Wan­bao that Wong worked there last year, but left not long af­ter.</p>
    <p>Neigh­bours told The Sun­day Times that a cou­ple, be­lieved to be Foo and Wong, lived with the girl in the condo unit where she was said to have been killed.</p>
    <p>The home is not reg­is­tered un­der ei­ther of their names, ac­cord­ing to In­land Rev­enue Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore records.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple and the child moved into the condo sev­eral years ago, said neigh­bours who de­clined to be named, adding that they would hear a child play­ing in­side the unit.</p>
    <p>Neigh­bours said the po­lice had gone door to door last Thurs­day and Fri­day to ask them when they had last seen the girl, but sev­eral said they could not re­call.</p>
    <p>News of the al­leged mur­der also came as a shock, with some neigh­bours not­ing that many res­i­dents in the condo keep to them­selves and do not so­cialise much with one another.</p>
    <p>“Of course we were shocked... I didn’t re­alise such a thing could hap­pen,” said a neigh­bour who lived sev­eral doors away from the cou­ple.</p>
    <p>Another said: “Who would have thought we’d be liv­ing next to a crime scene?”</p>
    <p>Of­fend­ers con­victed of mur­der with com­mon in­ten­tion face the death penalty.</p>
    <p>Those found guilty of dis­pos­ing a corpse to pre­vent de­tec­tion of an of­fence with com­mon in­ten­tion can be jailed for up to seven years.</p>
