    <p>It has been a hot and wet week, just as the weath­er­man pre­dicted.</p>
    <p>Tues­day night was a hot 30.5 deg C, but it was a chilly, rainy morn­ing yesterday, with the tem­per­a­ture dip­ping to 22.5 deg C in Changi.</p>
    <p>Na­tional wa­ter agency PUB said the heavy down­pour re­sulted in a 50mm depth of ac­cu­mu­lated wa­ter on Alju­nied Road, below the Pan-Is­land Ex­press­way fly­over, at around 7am.</p>
    <p>The Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Ser­vice Sin­ga­pore (MSS) said in a state­ment last month that warm and hu­mid nights were ex­pected in the first half of Au­gust, with tem­per­a­tures hov­er­ing around 28 deg C.</p>
    <p>Though rain­fall for the first fort­night of this month was fore­cast to be slightly below nor­mal over most parts of Sin­ga­pore, wide­spread thun­dery showers with gusty winds were ex­pected in the early morn­ing on two to three days, the MSS said.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Koh Tieh Yong, a weather sci­en­tist at the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences, said that heavy down­pours after a few days of hot weather oc­curs when warm air rises rapidly in a squall, caus­ing wa­ter vapour to con­dense and pre­cip­i­tate to form large quan­ti­ties of rain.</p>
    <p>“This phe­nom­e­non is com­mon dur­ing the south-west mon­soon sea­son, which takes place ev­ery year from late May to Septem­ber,” said Prof Koh.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ben­jamin Hor­ton, direc­tor of the Earth Ob­ser­va­tory of Sin­ga­pore, said hot weather with in­tense heavy rain in July and Au­gust may be in­flu­enced by longer-term trends from cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>“Global warm­ing from the burn­ing of fos­sil fu­els has caused Sin­ga­pore to heat up twice as fast as the rest of the world – at 0.25 deg C per decade. It is al­most 1 deg C hot­ter to­day than in the 1950s, and 2019 was Sin­ga­pore’s joint hottest year (with 2016) on record. When you have warmer air tem­per­a­ture, there is sig­nif­i­cantly more mois­ture in the at­mos­phere, which in­creases the in­ten­sity of down­pours.</p>
    <p>“The rate of evap­o­ra­tion from the ocean is also in­creas­ing as the world warms, con­tribut­ing to more ex­treme rain and snow events glob­ally,” said Prof Hor­ton.</p>
