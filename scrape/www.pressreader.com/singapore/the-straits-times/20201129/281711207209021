    <p>The Malaysian au­thor­i­ties’ sud­den de­ci­sion to im­pose a RM50,000 (S$16,540) fine on em­ploy­ers for each for­eign worker f ound liv­ing i n over­crowded lodg­ing has sent shock waves through in­dus­try play­ers.</p>
    <p>The Fed­er­a­tion of Malaysia Man­u­fac­tur­ers (FMM) said the Hu­man Re­sources Min­istry had given them un­til next March to com­ply with Act 446 of the Em­ploy­ees’ Min­i­mum Stan­dards of Hous­ing, Ac­com­mo­da­tions and Ameni­ties.</p>
    <p>It was there­fore a shock, FMM said, when Se­nior Min­is­ter Is­mail Sabri Yaakob an­nounced the penalty would be im­posed from last Thurs­day, in a move to re­duce the risk of Covid-19 trans­mis­sion among for­eign work­ers in over­crowded hous­ing.</p>
    <p>“Em­ploy­ers are mak­ing the nec­es­sary ad­just­ments, and are in the process of car­ry­ing out the nec­es­sary changes to com­ply with the reg­u­la­tions,” said FMM pres­i­dent Soh Thian Lai.</p>
    <p>“This sud­den change of pol­icy ap­pears to show lack of com­mu­ni­ca­tion among govern­ment agen­cies,” he said, adding that em­ploy­ers needed time to make the nec­es­sary changes, in­clud­ing for ren­o­va­tions and ap­ply­ing for per­mits to con­vert non-res­i­den­tial spa­ces into dwelling en­claves.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Is­mail said the govern­ment will im­pose the stiff fine per worker un­less em­ploy­ers pro­vide im­proved lodg­ings – in­clud­ing those that al­low for so­cial dis­tanc­ing – after news of wide­spread Covid-19 in­fec­tions among thou­sands of mi­grant work­ers at Top Glove’s Se­lan­gor fac­to­ries and dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>He also said the govern­ment will con­duct Covid-19 tests on 1.7 mil­lion for­eign work­ers. Em­ploy­ers gen­er­ally do not pro­vide hous­ing for le­gal mi­grant work­ers un­less they work in fac­to­ries or at con­struc­tion sites.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Soh said the FMM wrote to Hu­man Re­sources Min­is­ter M. Sar­a­vanan in Au­gust, and met him in Septem­ber to seek a 12-month grace pe­riod for firms to make the ex­ten­sive ad­just­ments be­fore the au­thor­i­ties took puni­tive ac­tion.</p>
    <p>He said many town and district coun­cils did not have guide­lines and def­i­nite time­lines to quickly ap­prove ap­pli­ca­tions to al­low the in­dus­try to in­crease or con­vert lodg­ing units for work­ers. Some work­ers are housed in shoplots.</p>
    <p>“Con­vert­ing shoplots into dwelling space will take time, es­pe­cially with the ad­di­tional cost in­curred to ren­o­vate the area fol­low­ing the spec­i­fi­ca­tions out­lined in the reg­u­la­tions, apart from meet­ing other re­quire­ments by the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>Small and Medium En­ter­prises As­so­ci­a­tion of Malaysia pres­i­dent Michael Kang said the au­thor­i­ties should en­gage all stake­hold­ers to un­der­stand the un­der­ly­ing prob­lems first.</p>
    <p>“Im­pos­ing such a hefty fine will only kill the in­dus­try,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The mid-tier com­pa­nies said they can af­ford to pro­vide bet­ter ac­com­mo­da­tion for for­eign work­ers. But the ma­jor­ity can’t. And most of the em­ploy­ers can’t com­ply within such short no­tice.”</p>
    <p>Malaysia Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Sham­sud­din Bar­dan said many em­ploy­ers would “die faster” if the hefty RM50,000 fine were to be im­posed for every for­eign worker liv­ing in crowded units.</p>
    <p>“It is a very ex­pen­sive price to pay. Why bur­den the em­ploy­ers fur­ther with ad­di­tional cost dur­ing such chal­leng­ing times?”</p>
    <p>Malaysia yes­ter­day recorded 1,315 new Covid-19 cases. Four more fa­tal­i­ties were logged, tak­ing the death toll to 354.</p>
