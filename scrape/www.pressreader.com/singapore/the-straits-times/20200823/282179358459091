    <p>COLOGNE • Sevilla coach Julen Lopetegui en­joyed sweet re­demp­tion, after his side beat In­ter Mi­lan 3-2 in a thrilling Europa League fi­nal on Fri­day to hand the Spa­niard a first ma­jor tro­phy.</p>
    <p>The former Spain coach helped his coun­try qual­ify for the 2018 World Cup in style, but his stay in Rus­sia ended in sur­real cir­cum­stances when he was sacked a day be­fore the tour­na­ment kicked off after news leaked out that he had ne­go­ti­ated a move to Real Madrid.</p>
    <p>He then had a night­mare stay in the Span­ish cap­i­tal, and was fired only three months into the job.</p>
    <p>Lopetegui had been re­duced to tears by those abrupt de­par­tures.</p>
    <p>But, in Cologne, he shed tears of joy after Sevilla came from be­hind.</p>
    <p>“You have to know how to cope with dif­fi­cult mo­ments and over­come them. This is a feel­ing of im­mense hap­pi­ness,” the 53-year-old said. “I’m so grate­ful to our play­ers for how hard they worked. Our an­them says we never give up and tonight we proved that again.”</p>
    <p>His re­demp­tion was only part of the story. Home­grown cap­tain Je­sus Navas, who de­liv­ered the cross for Luuk de Jong’s equaliser after In­ter’s Romelu Lukaku opened the scor­ing from the spot, lifted the tro­phy for a third time fol­low­ing key roles in Sevilla’s first two Uefa Cup tri­umphs in 2006 and 2007.</p>
    <p>He was with Eng­land’s Manch­ester City dur­ing the Span­ish team’s three other wins.</p>
    <p>“Lopetegui works 24 hours a day, he has given ev­ery­thing for us and he has got the best out of us. He de­serves ev­ery­thing,” said Navas, who ded­i­cated the win to former Sevilla play­ers Jose An­to­nio Reyes, killed in a car crash last year, and An­to­nio Puerta, who died of a heart at­tack on the pitch aged 22 in 2007.</p>
    <p>Ar­gen­tinian mid­fielder Ever Banega, who had a dis­ap­point­ing sea­son with In­ter in 2016-17, also got an as­sist and won the tro­phy for the third time in his fi­nal match for the club be­fore he joins Saudi Ara­bia’s Al-Shabab. His floated free kick was headed on by de Jong three min­utes be­fore Diego Godin lev­elled mat­ters for In­ter.</p>
    <p>An over­head kick by de­fender Diego Car­los de­flected into his own net by Lukaku – whose opener set the long­est scor­ing run of 11 con­sec­u­tive games in the Europa League – set­tled the con­test.</p>
    <p>That Car­los and de Jong were among nine starters – in­clud­ing Jules Kounde, Lu­cas Ocam­pos, Joan Jor­dan, Fer­nando, Ser­gio Reguilon, Suso and Yas­sine Bono – who ar­rived in Sevilla last sum­mer was also a credit to club di­rec­tor of foot­ball Monchi.</p>
    <p>The former goal­keeper left for Roma in 2017 after help­ing the La</p>
    <p>Liga side to 11 tro­phies in 17 years in his back­room role. But he re­turned last year to lead another re­build.</p>
    <p>Now, it is the fu­ture of In­ter man­ager An­to­nio Conte in ques­tion after the Ital­ian cast fresh doubt over his po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>“We will try to plan the fu­ture of In­ter with or with­out me,” said the 51-year-old, who also led the club to sec­ond in Serie A, one point be­hind Ju­ven­tus.</p>
    <p>“It has been a very tough sea­son from all points of view, the best de­ci­sion must be taken for the good of In­ter, with the ut­most cor­dial­ity. There is no re­sent­ment, there are dif­fer­ent points of view.”</p>
