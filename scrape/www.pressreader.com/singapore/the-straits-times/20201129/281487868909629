    <p>Iran ac­cuses Is­rael and the United States of as­sas­si­nat­ing its top nu­clear sci­en­tist as its Supreme Leader Ay­a­tol­lah Ali Khamenei vowed re­tal­i­a­tion, sharply es­ca­lat­ing ten­sions in the Per­sian Gulf in the fi­nal weeks of Mr Don­ald Trump’s pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>TE­HERAN • Iran ac­cused Is­rael and the United States of be­ing be­hind the as­sas­si­na­tion of its top nu­clear sci­en­tist Mohsen Fakhrizade­h on Fri­day and vowed re­venge, sharply es­ca­lat­ing ten­sions in the Per­sian Gulf in the fi­nal weeks of Don­ald Trump’s US pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>Dr Fakhrizade­h was the head of re­search and in­no­va­tion at Iran’s Min­istry of De­fence and widely seen as hav­ing a ma­jor role in the coun­try’s nu­clear pro­gramme. He was killed close to the Da­ma­vand cam­pus of Is­lamic Azad Univer­sity, about 60km east of cen­tral Te­heran, the semi-of­fi­cial Tas­nim news agency re­ported.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ay­a­tol­lah Ali Khamenei on his Twit­ter feed promised re­tal­i­a­tion for Dr Fakhrizade­h’s as­sas­si­na­tion and said his nu­clear work would con­tinue.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Has­san Rouhani called the killing an “act of ter­ror­ism” car­ried out by the “mer­ce­nary Is­rael regime”, ac­cord­ing to a state­ment pub­lished on his of­fi­cial news por­tal yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Ter­ror­ists mur­dered an em­i­nent Ira­nian sci­en­tist today. This cow­ardice – with se­ri­ous in­di­ca­tions of Is­raeli role – shows des­per­ate war­mon­ger­ing of per­pe­tra­tors,” For­eign Min­is­ter Mo­ham­mad Javad Zarif said in a tweet, with­out of­fer­ing any ev­i­dence for Is­rael’s in­volve­ment.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter of De­fence Amir Hatami told state TV the killing was “clearly linked” to the US as­sas­si­na­tion of Gen­eral Qassem Soleimani by drone in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>“Our en­e­mies are hav­ing a stress­ful few weeks,” Mr Rouhani said on state tele­vi­sion. “The era of their pres­sure is wan­ing as global cir­cum­stances are chang­ing. It’s im­por­tant for them to make the most of the next few weeks.”</p>
    <p>The deputy leader of Le­banon’s Iran-backed Hizbol­lah move­ment, Sheikh Naim Qassem, also ac­cused the US and Is­rael of spon­sor­ing the as­sas­si­na­tion.</p>
    <p>The of­fice of Is­raeli Prime Min­is­ter Ben­jamin Ne­tanyahu de­clined to com­ment, as did Pen­tagon of­fi­cials. But for­mer di­rec­tor of the US Cen­tral In­tel­li­gence Agency John Bren­nan said on Twit­ter that he did not know if a for­eign govern­ment had au­tho­rised or car­ried out the mur­der but “such an act of state-spon­sored ter­ror­ism would be a fla­grant vi­o­la­tion of in­ter­na­tional law & en­cour­age more gov­ern­ments to carry out lethal at­tacks against for­eign of­fi­cials”.</p>
    <p>Mr Bren­nan noted that Dr Fakhrizade­h was nei­ther a des­ig­nated ter­ror­ist nor a mem­ber of AlQaeda or the Is­lamic State group, des­ig­nated ter­ror groups which would be le­gal tar­gets.</p>
    <p>US news web­site Ax­ios re­ported this week that Is­rael’s govern­ment had in­structed the mil­i­tary to pre­pare for a pos­si­ble US strike against Iran dur­ing the re­main­der of Mr Trump’s term, though it said</p>
    <p>WAN­ING ERA</p>
    <p>the or­der wasn’t based on in­tel­li­gence or an as­sess­ment that the US would or­der an at­tack.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump re-tweeted a news re­port on Dr Fakhrizade­h’s killing with­out com­ment, and a tweet by an Is­raeli jour­nal­ist who called the killing “a ma­jor psy­cho­log­i­cal and pro­fes­sional blow for Iran”.</p>
    <p>Te­heran has blamed the spy agen­cies of Is­rael and the US for the killing of four other Ira­nian nu­clear sci­en­tists since 2010.</p>
    <p>Dr Fakhrizade­h’s as­sas­si­na­tion could trig­ger the sort of pop­u­lar anger that fol­lowed the killing of Mr Soleimani in a drone strike in Bagh­dad or­dered by Mr Trump. Iran fired mis­siles at bases hous­ing US troops in Iraq in re­sponse to that at­tack, caus­ing no fa­tal­i­ties but rais­ing fears of a slide to war be­tween the two ad­ver­saries.</p>
    <p>Our en­e­mies are hav­ing a stress­ful few weeks. The era of their pres­sure is wan­ing as global cir­cum­stances are chang­ing. It’s im­por­tant for them to make the most ’’ of the next few weeks. IRAN’S PRES­I­DENT HAS­SAN ROUHANI, of­fer­ing his rea­sons for the killing of</p>
    <p>Dr Mohsen Fakhrizade­h.</p>
