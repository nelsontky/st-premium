        Features Life | The Sunday Times Sunday, July 26, 2020 | C9 A single man’s food for thought my friend, the food writer, who for a while went four times a day to his ageing parents’ home to cook, clean and help his dad put on his socks because during the lockdown in his city, no helper was available.
The second is of my mother’s cook in India, a man in his 40s, who one day comes to her and says he’s discovered the constructi­on workers who have done repair work on the house through the years are unemployed and hungry. How will they manage, he asks her. You must help, he tells her. And she, struck by his conscience, does.
The third story is of the civil rights activist John Lewis, who recently passed away. In 1960, he was part of the non-violent sit-ins where African-American activists fought racial segregatio­n by sitting at whites-only lunch counters and asking to be served.
In his book, Walking With The Wind, Lewis recounts that they were racially abused, punched, pushed; mustard was poured on one activist and a cigarette was put out on another. And yet they sat there, stoic, brave, committed, principled, and it may have been 60 years ago, but it’s a representa­tion of the human spirit that is so beautifull­y jolting.
We’re all right now caught up in our own tiny resistance movements against this virus. Scrapping to stay sane. And it’s a good time to remember the courage and character of Lewis and his fellow activists who, when arrested by the police for “disorderly conduct”, walked out singing a song as relevant then as it is now.
We Shall Overcome. wordless silence.
Books are adequate company for some, but most people crave conversati­on and connection. In Japan, wrote The Economist, dating in a social-distancing time involves young people in separate cars flirting in a carpark. Searching for a partner is only impeded, never halted. It reminded me of Madhavi Menon’s book, Infinite Variety: A History Of Desire In India, where she writes about the mathematic­s of love and the theory of the Greek playwright-poet Aristophan­es:
“According to his fable, all people were originally double, with two sets of arms and legs and two sets of genitals, until the gods cut them in half to stem the growing power of humans.
“Since that traumatic slicing, every human being has been in search of her or his ‘other half’... People continue to refer to their partners as ‘their better halves’ because in this romantic worldview, one and one is supposed to add up to one.”
But I feel whole because of the dabbas. This is love, too; this is concern that is chopped, spiced, cooked and sent; this is the low, lasting flame of enduring friendship. These women and one man do more than feed me, they sustain me.
It is intriguing, the things you lean on in a crisis; where you find nourishmen­t, what inspires you. I find comfort in stories of decency and duty and unselfishn­ess, for they are simple human traits which we can use to resist the inhumanity of this Covid time.
Three stories I hold close, all oddly related to food. The first is of when it ends? Crisis has a capacity to reveal us. In my notes is written, “Things I Am Thinking Of” and a list follows, which includes dabbas, bigots, interviews, silence, ageing, privilege, Roger Federer, John Lewis, depression, generosity. In the sunshine, ideas drift idly through the head like the two sulking swans crossing the pond.
One way to fight this virus is to distract ourselves, to take all the time we have and spend it not in fear but in gentle flights of imaginatio­n. I want to be informed by, but not hostage to, this virus, enlightene­d but not agitated by a future that is unreadable.
So I think of Federer and isn’t summer humdrum without losing yourself in his play? I wonder where the squirrels go when they brutally prune the trees outside my window. I think it’s a relief to interview a subject across a table because during the circuit breaker period, on video calls, it was hard to read an interviewe­e’s body language, smell their arrogance or feel their smile and what you got was only a faint sketch of a human.
I think of love because no one lets single people forget it. As if our unattachme­nt translates to incomplete­ness. A colleague kindly sends me an article which claims single men are “hit hardest” by loneliness. Everybody these days has a study for everything.
But yes, Covid has forced us to move less, talk not so much and sit more, and this quiet stillness for those who live alone can be testing. But maybe I was partially ready for Covid because after a divorce, your vocabulary feels exhausted and you find comfort in a somewhat To open the dabba is to be assailed by all manner of smells and delicacies. Love has multiple flavours. At 57, while sex is very agreeable, it is this food that is more vital for inept single men who subsist on cardboard salads.
I tell these ladies, “enough now, my paunch grows”, but they hear only the murmured, desperate truth behind my lies: “More, please, more.” Isolation has revealed me as pathetic. A friend sneers at me for he writes a brilliant cooking column and women adore him for his versatilit­y. But I am all greed and no culinary ability, a devotee of film-maker Orson Welles who once clarified: “Ask not what you can do for your country. Ask what’s for lunch.”
Food was top of my list as I scratched out notes for this column while sitting in a gazebo at the Botanic Gardens. It was a day so beautiful it made me consider the possibilit­y of a god. Even the faith of atheists can be shaken.
Bringing a notepad to nature would have met with Walt Whitman’s approval, for he wrote in his poem, Song Of The Open Road: “Now I see the secret of making the best persons; It is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the earth.”
Of course, this outdoor office is not mine alone and I share it politely with a jungle fowl, a water monitor, a white-breasted water hen and two frolicking squirrels. They foraged for food, me for ideas.
Maybe we should have all kept lockdown diaries, raw human chronicles of an experience we’d never imagined. Who were we when it started and who will we be Rohit Brijnath I have become the pet project of a few women, most of them married, but kindly readjust your excitement because it is not what you think. Every fortnight or so, in perfectly packed bags, small dabbas of infinite promise appear at my door. Dabba is the Hindi word for container and women will forever look at you askance if they are not returned.
