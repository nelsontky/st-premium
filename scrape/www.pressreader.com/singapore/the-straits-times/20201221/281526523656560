    <p>Green loans are gain­ing trac­tion among com­pa­nies here amid height­ened aware­ness of sus­tain­abil­ity-re­lated is­sues and the wider avail­abil­ity of fi­nan­cial prod­ucts.

    <p>NOT JUST A TRANS­AC­TION</p>
    <p>Green loans are gain­ing trac­tion among com­pa­nies here amid height­ened aware­ness of sus­tain­abil­ity-re­lated is­sues and the wider avail­abil­ity of fi­nan­cial prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Banks said they have re­ceived more queries from firms af­ter launch­ing frame­works to help busi­nesses get loans that can fi­nance projects with an en­vi­ron­men­tal and so­cial im­pact.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank and UOB were among the first banks to de­velop such frame­works un­der the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore Green and Sus­tain­abil­ity-Linked Loan Grant Scheme.</p>
    <p>The scheme, which started last month, was the first in the world.</p>
    <p>It sup­ported OCBC in de­vel­op­ing a frame­work aimed at help­ing small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) ac­cess sus­tain­able fi­nanc­ing of up to $20 mil­lion. This will cover projects re­lated to cat­e­gories such as en­ergy ef­fi­ciency, green build­ings and pol­lu­tion con­trol, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee Hwee Boon, OCBC’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor and head of mid­dle mar­ket and ser­vices for global en­ter­prise bank­ing, said: “We have been able to bet­ter en­gage SMEs as the frame­work sig­nif­i­cantly re­duces the time and re­sources needed to adopt sus­tain­able fi­nance so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>“As a re­sult, we have ob­served that more of our cus­tomers are now in­clined to se­ri­ously con­sider such so­lu­tions – and the frame­work has just been launched, so the pos­i­tive re­sponse so far bodes well for fu­ture take-up.”</p>
    <p>The bank eval­u­ates el­i­gi­ble green ini­tia­tives with the frame­work in place, so SMEs need only to pro­vide doc­u­men­ta­tion as proof that loans will go to the spe­cific projects.</p>
    <p>They will no longer need to de­velop be­spoke sus­tain­able fi­nance frame­works be­fore ap­ply­ing for a green loan, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>This is es­pe­cially im­por­tant as smaller firms are more likely to have con­straints in man­power and fund­ing, and sus­tain­able fi­nance could be put on the back­burner as a re­sult, noted Ms Lee.</p>
    <p>More com­pa­nies have also shown in­ter­est in sus­tain­able fi­nanc­ing, she said, with more than $1.6 bil­lion given to sup­port SMEs and mid-cap firms in sus­tain­able projects re­lat­ing to green build­ings, hos­pi­tal­ity, con­struc­tion and so­lar en­ergy in the last two years.</p>
    <p>UOB also launched a frame­work to fi­nance com­pa­nies con­tribut­ing to smart-city cre­ation last month and has since re­ceived more queries from both SMEs and large com­pa­nies on sus­tain­abil­ity-re­lated is­sues.</p>
    <p>Mr Vin­cent Yeong, UOB’s head of Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive and En­vi­ron­men­tal, So­cial and Gov­er­nance so­lu­tions, said: “SMEs face chal­lenges in ac­cess­ing sus­tain­able fi­nanc­ing due to a lack of un­der­stand­ing on the el­i­gi­bil­ity cri­te­ria for qual­i­fi­ca­tion, and few SMEs can com­mit the re­sources to mon­i­tor and to com­ply with green re­port­ing.</p>
    <p>“These frame­works pro­vide com­pa­nies with stan­dard­ised re­port­ing tem­plates, mon­i­tor­ing the use of pro­ceeds and track­ing the en­vi­ron­men­tal and so­cial im­pact of their busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>The bank ex­tended more than $2 bil­lion in sus­tain­able fi­nanc­ing to clients in the first nine months of this year.</p>
    <p>Wa­ter treat­ment and tech­nol­ogy com­pany Cen­tury Wa­ter Sys­tems and Tech­nolo­gies is one SME that has taken up a green loan with OCBC un­der the frame­work. It bor­rowed $2 mil­lion for a project to help semi­con­duc­tor firm Global-Foundries re­cy­cle wa­ter for a con­tract of 10 years.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive Eu­gene Liu said the loan was ap­proved af­ter pro­vid­ing doc­u­men­ta­tion that the project helps to save wa­ter.</p>
    <p>“We are def­i­nitely l ook­ing at more op­por­tu­ni­ties to con­duct sim­i­lar long-term sus­tain­abil­ity projects with other firms,” he said, not­ing that two other semi­con­duc­tor com­pa­nies have also ap­proached him for de­tails.</p>
    <p>Kaer, a firm that pro­vides air-con­di­tion­ing as a ser­vice to com­mer­cial and in­dus­trial build­ings, also took OCBC green loans to sup­port projects to help build­ings be­come more sus­tain­able.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive Justin Tay­lor noted that although the green loan does not carry a fi­nan­cial in­cen­tive, it is a sym­bol that sus­tain­abil­ity met­rics are as im­por­tant as com­mer­cial ones for all the as­sets in Kaer’s port­fo­lio.</p>
    <p>“With the la­bel of be­ing green at­tached to it, peo­ple be­come more aware,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The loan rep­re­sents the meet­ing of minds be­tween us and the bank, and shows that we have the com­mon pur­pose of not just do­ing some­thing good for busi­ness, but also for the en­vi­ron­ment and com­mu­nity. It is not just a trans­ac­tion any­more.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany has $50 mil­lion of as­sets un­der man­age­ment in such projects here.</p>
    <p>Kaer cus­tomer suc­cess lead David Mack­er­ness said: “When we... started, it was all about the cus­tomer ex­pe­ri­ence... but as we went along, more peo­ple started see­ing the sus­tain­abil­ity ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>“Now money is also mov­ing to­wards back­ing ideas that fit peo­ple’s val­ues.”</p>
