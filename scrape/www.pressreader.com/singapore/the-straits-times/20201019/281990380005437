    <p>The de­sign of the up­com­ing Pasir Pan­jang Park will fo­cus on the his­tory of the area and in­cor­po­rate more na­ture el­e­ments, fol­low­ing dis­cus­sions with the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Be­tween Jan 18 and May 31, around 170 stake­hold­ers came for­ward to dis­cuss the de­sign of the park, the Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) said on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>“This is part of our larger Sin­ga­pore To­gether move­ment where we plan to in­volve more Sin­ga­pore­ans in shap­ing more than 50 parks over the next five years,” Na­tional</p>
    <p>De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Des­mond Lee said about the ini­tia­tive in a Face­book post on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The views of peo­ple liv­ing or work­ing near the up­com­ing park were gath­ered through work­shops, fo­cus-group dis­cus­sions and on­site in­ter­views.</p>
    <p>In these con­ver­sa­tions, they wanted Pasir Pan­jang’s his­tory to be fea­tured as part of the park’s iden­tity, with a strong pref­er­ence for self-guided walks, said NParks.</p>
    <p>The site of the park was for­merly a beach that stretched from present-day Labrador Na­ture Re­serve to the junc­tion of Cle­menti and West Coast roads, and was later de­vel­oped into Pasir Pan­jang Power Sta­tion and con­tainer ter­mi­nals.</p>
    <p>NParks said stake­hold­ers pre­ferred to learn about life in the past through other peo­ple’s per­spec­tives and sto­ries, rather than just the his­tor­i­cal facts about the area.</p>
    <p>“Fu­ture vis­i­tors will get to ex­pe­ri­ence care­fully cu­rated en­coun­ters through sto­ries con­trib­uted by the com­mu­nity and port items do­nated by PSA placed in se­lected lo­ca­tions in the park,” it said.</p>
    <p>Three-quar­ters of stake­hold­ers in­di­cated that the park’s main fea­ture should fo­cus on nat­u­ral el­e­ments and use less man-made ma­te­ri­als.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, struc­tures in the park such as toi­lets will have green roofs to soften the look of the in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>To pay homage to the area’s sandy coast­line prior to de­vel­op­ment, the park’s land­scap­ing will in­clude plots of sand amid coastal veg­e­ta­tion. Vis­i­tors can build sand­cas­tles in ar­eas where the beach once stood.</p>
    <p>Pasir Pan­jang Park will be built in phases, with the first sec­tion tar­geted for com­ple­tion next year.</p>
    <p>The park is part of the Gov­ern­ment’s plans to re­ju­ve­nate the Greater South­ern Water­front area, which ex­tends from Pasir Pan­jang to Ma­rina East.</p>
    <p>It is also an ex­ten­sion of the NParks’ Friends of the Parks ini­tia­tive, which aims to pro­mote the re­spon­si­ble use of parks.</p>
