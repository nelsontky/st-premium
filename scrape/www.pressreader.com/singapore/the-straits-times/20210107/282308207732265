    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s bench­mark Straits Times In­dex ended at 2,863.01 yes­ter­day, just 3.33 points or 0.12 per cent higher than the day be­fore, in its re­sponse to the run-off elec­tions for two seats i n the</p>
    <p>United States Se­nate in the state of Ge­or­gia and the j ump in oil prices.</p>
    <p>Some 2.37 bil­lion se­cu­ri­ties worth $1.29 bil­lion changed hands, with ad­vancers out­num­ber­ing de­clin­ers by 299 to 166.</p>
    <p>Top in­dex per­former, con­glom­er­ate Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries, added five cents or 2.91 per cent to $1.77.</p>
    <p>This was as an­a­lysts an­tic­i­pated the out­per­for­mance of US in­fra­struc­ture plays in min­ing, con­struc­tion and re­new­ables – in re­sponse to an ex­pected “blue sweep” sce­nario in the Ge­or­gia run-offs.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Ex­change was the worst per­former, de­clin­ing 10 cents or 1.03 per cent to $9.60, cor­rect­ing from ex­u­ber­ant gains recorded on Mon­day on pos­si­ble profit-tak­ing.</p>
    <p>The most ac­tive counter of the day was Sem­b­corp Ma­rine – for the third con­sec­u­tive day. It gained 1.2 cents or 8 per cent to 16.2 cents, on a vol­ume of 416.4 mil­lion, more than triple its trad­ing vol­ume on Tues­day. This was likely in re­sponse to the oil price rally to above US$50 per bar­rel.</p>
    <p>Mr Ter­ence Chua, an an­a­lyst at Phillip Se­cu­ri­ties Re­search, said that in­vestors are also likely still ex­pect­ing a merger an­nounce­ment with Kep­pel’s off­shore and ma­rine unit by mid-Jan­u­ary.</p>
    <p>Axi chief global mar­ket strate­gist Stephen Innes noted that Saudi Ara­bia’s ad­di­tional vol­un­tary cuts of oil pro­duc­tion for Fe­bru­ary and March – ex­plained as a ges­ture of good­will to ac­cel­er­ate global oil in­ven­to­ries’ draw­down – was a clear near-term pos­i­tive for oil.</p>
    <p>This was the first time West Texas In­ter­me­di­ate crude oil prices crossed the US$50-a-bar­rel mark since Fe­bru­ary last year.</p>
    <p>Re­gional in­dexes fin­ished mixed. The Hang Seng In­dex gained 0.15 per cent and the Shang­hai Com­pos­ite In­dex added 0.63 per cent, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 ex­tended losses, de­clin­ing 0.38 per cent. Malaysia’s KLCI shed 1.02 per cent.</p>
