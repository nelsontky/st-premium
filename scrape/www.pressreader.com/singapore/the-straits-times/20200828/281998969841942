    <p>There are op­por­tu­ni­ties for Asean amid the Covid-19 pan­demic and the US-China trade war, which have caused sup­ply chain shifts. How­ever, Asean needs to get its act to­gether by step­ping up on the economic in­te­gra­tion that is cen­tral to its ra­tio­nale as a re­gional or­gan­i­sa­tion. In or­der to emerge as a grow­ing mar­ket of end demand and a re­silient base of pro­duc­tion, it must po­si­tion it­self firmly in the larger Asian sup­ply chain, of­fer­ing it­self as an Asian pro­duc­tion re­gion that is open to the rest of the world. This role held true, even be­fore the emer­gence of the Sino-US trade con­flict, but those dif­fer­ences have ac­cel­er­ated the need for suf­fi­cient re­gional bal­last and mo­men­tum to en­able Asean to seize a cru­cial mo­ment in global economic trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has ex­ac­er­bated di­vi­sive sen­ti­ments of economic na­tion­al­ism. The dis­ease re­vealed how eas­ily the trusted lo­gis­ti­cal in­fra­struc­ture of world trade and travel could be dis­rupted by a pan­demic that has led to the swift clos­ing of bor­ders. Mov­ing against the very spirit of glob­al­i­sa­tion, which re­quires open economic bor­ders, Covid-19 drove coun­tries to care for their pop­u­la­tions first in the man­u­fac­ture and distri­bu­tion of es­sen­tial med­i­cal sup­plies. Un­for­tu­nately, epi­demi­o­log­i­cal ne­ces­sity fed economic habit. Con­se­quently, there now is the height­ened like­li­hood of global sup­ply chains in many sec­tors be­com­ing shorter and less just-in-time, lead­ing to the frag­men­ta­tion of the trad­ing sys­tem and the re­lo­ca­tion of some pro­duc­tion closer to home. While Covid-19 will pass, its economic reper­cus­sions will linger for a while. The fall­out from the US-China trade con­flict will also be felt far longer be­cause it re­flects pro­found struc­tural changes in po­lit­i­cal and strate­gic re­la­tions be­tween the world’s two largest economic pow­ers.</p>
    <p>In such cir­cum­stances, Asean en­joys cer­tain ad­van­tages. Its 10 na­tions do not be­long ex­clu­sively to one or the other pole of geopo­lit­i­cal ri­valry con­sti­tuted by the United States and China today. Both Washington and Bei­jing know this, and tai­lor their poli­cies to­wards South-east Asia ac­cord­ingly. What this strate­gic free­dom does is to give Asean room for economic ma­noeu­vre be­tween the two world pow­ers. The threat­ened de­cou­pling of the Amer­i­can and Chi­nese economies will not cut a de­struc­tive swathe through Asean col­lec­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>South-east Asia can move for­ward on that ba­sis, but only if Asean con­tin­ues to broaden and deepen the pace of re­gional in­te­gra­tion. Ad­mit­tedly, Covid-19 has set Asean coun­tries back eco­nom­i­cally. How­ever, as they look be­yond this dread­ful phase in their un­fold­ing history, mem­bers of Asean should con­sider closely how to build a more re­silient sup­ply chain within and keep up its ac­cess to other parts of the world. Open re­gion­al­ism is the cor­ner­stone of the mul­ti­lat­eral or­der.</p>
