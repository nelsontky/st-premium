    <p>MON­TREAL Ten­sions be­tween the World Anti-Dop­ing Agency (Wada) and the United States flared on Thurs­day, as a US gov­ern­ment rep­re­sen­ta­tive called a pro­posal to sanc­tion coun­tries that with­draw agreed upon fund­ing “a di­rect at­tack on the United States”.</p>
    <p>A vir­tual meet­ing of Wada’s Foun­da­tion Board saw of­fi­cials from both the global watchdog and the United States voic­ing the need for co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>But An­thony Jones, rep­re­sen­ta­tive of the US Of­fice of Na­tional Drug Con­trol Pol­icy (ONDCP), bris­tled at a pro­posal to pun­ish coun­tries that opt out of fund­ing.</p>
    <p>That was just what the ONDCP rec­om­mended US law­mak­ers be given the power to do in June, ac­cus­ing Wada of fail­ing to im­ple­ment gov­er­nance re­forms.</p>
    <p>The United States con­trib­uted US$2.7 mil­lion (S$3.6 mil­lion) to Wada’s 2020 bud­get of</p>
    <p>US$37.4 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing vir­tual meet­ings this week, Wada’s ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee and Foun­da­tion Board dis­cussed pos­si­ble sanc­tions against mem­ber coun­tries that fail to pay up, say­ing the US threat ex­posed a gap in the Wada Code.</p>
    <p>And Wada on Thurs­day touted mul­ti­ple re­forms it is un­der­tak­ing, af­ter crit­i­cism not only from the US but also from ath­lete groups and na­tional anti-dop­ing or­gan­i­sa­tions for lack of trans­parency and in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, Wada has de­cided to ap­point two in­de­pen­dent mem­bers to its ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee, whose 12 mem­bers are com­posed equally of rep­re­sen­ta­tives of the Olympic move­ment and gov­ern­ments.</p>
    <p>It also set up a work­ing group to pro­pose new re­forms and eval­u­ate those al­ready im­ple­mented.</p>
    <p>For Wada pres­i­dent Wi­told Banka, th­ese are “sig­nif­i­cant im­prove­ments to­wards greater in­de­pen­dence and bet­ter rep­re­sen­ta­tion of ath­letes and na­tional an­tidop­ing or­gan­i­sa­tions”.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese re­forms are just the be­gin­ning,” Banka added as both he and Wada di­rec­tor-gen­eral Olivier Nig­gli stressed the need for co­op­er­a­tion be­tween the agency and the United States. “I am ready to work hand-in-hand with our col­leagues (and) with the United States. We need each other, we need to work col­lab­o­ra­tively for the fu­ture of anti-dop­ing.”</p>
    <p>The United States is at odds with</p>
    <p>Wada over sev­eral is­sues, in­clud­ing Wada’s reser­va­tions about the Rod­chenkov Act – leg­is­la­tion mak­ing its way through the US Congress that would al­low the crim­i­nal pros­e­cu­tion of dop­ing.</p>
    <p>Wada ar­gues the law could un­der­mine its own ef­forts to po­lice dop­ing in in­ter­na­tional sport while not ap­ply­ing to US pro­fes­sional and col­lege ath­letes.</p>
    <p>In other mat­ters dis­cussed at this week’s meet­ings, Nig­gli ac­knowl­edged that the coro­n­avirus pan­demic could create “holes” in the drug test­ing pro­grammes of some coun­tries in the run-up to the Tokyo Olympics next year.</p>
    <p>“We are fol­low­ing the evo­lu­tion of the si­t­u­a­tion. We need to look at the list of ath­letes who can go to the Games in the com­ing months and make sure that there are not places in the world where, be­cause of Covid, there was a big hole and no test­ing for a while,” he said.</p>
