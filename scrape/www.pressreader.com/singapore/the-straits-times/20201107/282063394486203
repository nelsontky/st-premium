    <p>LON­DON Ris­ing green­house gas emis­sions from world­wide food pro­duc­tion will make it ex­tremely dif­fi­cult to limit global warm­ing to the tar­gets set in the Paris cli­mate agree­ment, even if emis­sions from fos­sil-fuel burn­ing were halted im­me­di­ately, sci­en­tists re­ported on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>But they said that meet­ing one of the tar­gets – lim­it­ing over­all warm­ing this cen­tury to 1.5 deg C – could be achieved through “rapid and am­bi­tious” changes to the global food sys­tem dur­ing the next sev­eral decades, in­clud­ing adopt­ing plant-rich di­ets, in­creas­ing crop yields and re­duc­ing food waste.</p>
    <p>“If we’re try­ing to meet the 1.5-de­gree Cel­sius tar­get, there is no sin­gle silver bul­let that is go­ing to get us there,” said Dr Michael Clark, a re­searcher at the Nuffield De­part­ment of Pop­u­la­tion Health at the</p>
    <p>Univer­sity of Ox­ford in Eng­land and the lead author of the new re­search, an anal­y­sis of the cli­mate ef­fects of global food pro­duc­tion pub­lished in the jour­nal Sci­ence. “But to­gether all of them will.”</p>
    <p>Un­der the 2015 UN Paris Cli­mate Agree­ment, nearly 200 na­tions agreed to limit global warm­ing to well be­low 2 deg C and aim for 1.5 deg C if pos­si­ble to re­duce the dam­ag­ing im­pacts of cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>Meet­ing the 2 deg C tar­get would be eas­ier, Dr Clark said. But in both cases, he added, the anal­y­sis is based on im­me­di­ately reach­ing “net zero” emis­sions from the burn­ing of fos­sil fu­els for elec­tric­ity, trans­porta­tion and in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Al­though coun­tries have pledged to re­duce them, cur­rent fos­sil-fuel emis­sions are nowhere near zero, and once they are fac­tored in, he said, “any food tran­si­tion prob­a­bly needs to be larger and faster”.</p>
    <p>Food pro­duc­tion re­sults in emis­sions of car­bon diox­ide, meth­ane and other planet-warm­ing gases in many ways, i nclud­ing l and clear­ing and de­for­esta­tion for agri­cul­ture and graz­ing, digestion by cat­tle and other live­stock, pro­duc­tion and use of fer­tilis­ers and the cul­ti­va­tion of rice in flooded pad­dies.</p>
    <p>Over­all emis­sions are equiv­a­lent to about 16 bil­lion met­ric tonnes of car­bon diox­ide a year, or about 30 per cent of to­tal global emis­sions.</p>
    <p>While the world tends to fo­cus on re­duc­ing emis­sions from fos­sil-fuel burn­ing, the new study shows cut­ting emis­sions from food is cru­cial, too, t he re­searchers said.</p>
    <p>“Food sys­tems are sort of the dark horse of cli­mate change,” said Pro­fes­sor Ja­son Hill, se­nior author of the pa­per and an aca­demic from the Univer­sity of Min­nesota.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers fore­cast how emis­sions would change in com­ing decades as the world pop­u­la­tion grows, di­ets and con­sump­tion pat­terns change as some coun­tries be­come more af­flu­ent, and crop yields in­crease.</p>
    <p>They found that food-re­lated emis­sions alone would quite likely re­sult in the world ex­ceed­ing the 1.5 deg C limit in 30 to 40 years. Food emis­sions alone would bring the world close to the 2 deg C limit by 2100.</p>
    <p>Dr Brent Lo­ken, the global lead food sci­en­tist for the World Wildlife Fund, who was not in­volved in the re­search, said the study was “one more piece of ev­i­dence that sup­ports what many peo­ple are say­ing”, that cli­mate goals can­not be reached with­out changes in the food sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“It’s re­ally less about where food sys­tem is to­day, and more about where it’s head­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>Analy­ses in re­cent years have pointed to the need to al­ter di­ets and make other changes in the food sys­tem both to im­prove hu­man health and make the sys­tem more sus­tain­able.</p>
    <p>Dr Lo­ken, for ex­am­ple, was a coau­thor of a re­port by the EATLancet Com­mis­sion, an in­ter­na­tional group of sci­en­tists, that rec­om­mended a 50 per cent re­duc­tion in global con­sump­tion of red meat and some other foods by 2050.</p>
    <p>He said that with­out changes, food emis­sions were ex­pected to dou­ble by 2050. “And the wig­gle room to meet the Paris lim­its is so small.”</p>
    <p>Prof Hill said that the study did not con­sider po­ten­tial shifts like the en­tire world pop­u­la­tion adopt­ing a ve­gan diet. “We wanted to present the ones that were re­al­is­tic goals,” he said. “A plant-rich diet is a re­al­is­tic goal. We’re not say­ing in this pa­per to hit these tar­gets we have to give up an­i­mal prod­ucts. But there need to be some di­etary shifts to­wards the health­ier di­ets,” he added.</p>
    <p>“There are so many dif­fer­ent ways we can do this,” said Dr Clark. “Ev­ery per­son has a role to play, ev­ery cor­po­ra­tion as well. Through col­lec­tive ac­tion and po­lit­i­cal will we can ac­tu­ally do this pretty rapidly.”</p>
    <p>The re­searchers found that food-re­lated emis­sions alone would quite likely re­sult in the world ex­ceed­ing the 1.5 deg C limit in 30 to 40 years. Food emis­sions alone would bring the world close to the 2 deg C limit by 2100.</p>
