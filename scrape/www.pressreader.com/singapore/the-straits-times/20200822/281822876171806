    <p>Ja­pan could ease its Covid-19 en­try re­stric­tions on its for­eign res­i­dents – which have been de­scribed as iso­la­tion­ist and out of step with ma­jor economies – from next month, pub­lic broad­caster NHK said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This comes amid strong back­lash from do­mes­tic and in­ter­na­tional busi­ness lobby groups.</p>
    <p>On the in­di­vid­ual level, the re­stric­tions have trig­gered an out­cry over the eco­nomic and emo­tional dis­tress to those who are af­fected.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan has an ef­fec­tive ban, with few ex­cep­tions, on the en­try of for­eign na­tion­als from 146 re­gions.</p>
    <p>This ex­tends be­yond leisure tourists and short-term busi­ness trav­ellers, but also to per­ma­nent res­i­dents, stu­dents and other longterm visa hold­ers, whose re-en­try con­tin­ues to be barred un­less they had left Ja­pan un­der special cases such as on com­pas­sion­ate grounds.</p>
    <p>But NHK said yes­ter­day, with­out cit­ing sources, that re-en­try will be per­mit­ted from next month for res­i­dent card hold­ers, so long as they un­dergo man­dated tests for Covid-19 and quar­an­tine them­selves for 14 days.</p>
    <p>This pol­icy now ap­plies to Ja­panese ci­ti­zens who are re-en­ter­ing the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Still, Reuters cited a con­sular of­fi­cial at Ja­pan’s for­eign min­istry as say­ing that there has been “no de­ci­sion yet” on the mat­ter, which will af­fect some 2.6 mil­lion for­eign­ers who have res­i­dence sta­tus i n Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese govern­ment – among whose ranks is Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Taro Aso, who drew flak in June when he at­trib­uted the na­tion’s l ow i nfec­tion num­bers to a dif­fer­ent “cul­tural stan­dard” than other coun­tries – has in­sisted the pol­icy was es­sen­tial to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>But Covid-19 cases and deaths are ris­ing in Ja­pan, where the daily tally stood at 1,034 cases and 15 deaths as at 9.30pm last night. Tokyo, with 258 cases, has not seen a two-digit in­fec­tion toll since July 9.</p>
    <p>This has not gone un­no­ticed, and the fact that a Ja­panese and a nonJa­panese pass­port holder with the ex­act same travel itin­er­ar­ies are be­ing ac­corded dif­fer­ent treat­ment was slammed as “dou­ble stan­dards” by the Amer­i­can Cham­ber of Com­merce in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Busi­ness Coun­cil (EBC) in Ja­pan also warned that the pol­icy was out of step with other ma­jor economies and will not only hurt in­vest­ment, but could also trig­ger in­vest­ment dis­putes.</p>
    <p>EBC pres­i­dent Michael Mroczek cau­tioned that the pol­icy may well cause busi­nesses to “re­think their pol­icy” to­wards Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan As­so­ci­a­tion of New Econ­omy chair­man Hiroshi Mik­i­tani said on Mon­day that with the pol­icy, Ja­pan is bound to “sac­ri­fice new busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties and ac­cess to knowl­edge and ex­per­tise”.</p>
    <p>Mr Mik­i­tani, who is also chief ex­ec­u­tive of e-com­merce com­pany</p>
    <p>Rakuten, added that Ja­pan is at risk of be­ing seen as a so­ci­ety that does not wel­come for­eign na­tion­als. This, he said, is “po­ten­tially dam­ag­ing our ap­peal over the mid to long term and caus­ing in­no­va­tion it­self to stag­nate”.</p>
    <p>Those who find them­selves un­able to re­turn in­clude Mr Lester Kang, 38, a Sin­ga­porean who left Ja­pan in June to at­tend to an ur­gent fam­ily mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The co-founder of real es­tate start-up MetroRes­i­dences told The Straits Times that his busi­ness has been hit by his ab­sence, prompt­ing him to set up a Face­book sup­port group for oth­ers who may be stranded like him. The closed group has drawn nearly 3,000 mem­bers in a month.</p>
    <p>“I feel that this travel re­stric­tion has cast a spot­light on how un­fairly the Ja­panese govern­ment treats its tax-pay­ing for­eign res­i­dents,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I have a Chi­nese friend whose mother had to un­dergo a can­cer op­er­a­tion, but could not travel to be with her loved one for fear that she will be un­able to re­turn to Ja­pan, which has been her home for the past 10 years,” he added.</p>
