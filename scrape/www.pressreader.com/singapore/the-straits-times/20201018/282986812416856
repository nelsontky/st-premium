    <p>Most fur­loughed pi­lots are now pick­ing up new skills or em­bark­ing on new ca­reers to ride through the tur­bu­lence in the avi­a­tion in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Malaysian pi­lot Ar­rif Ju­nid, 57, took up car­pen­try af­ter he and his peers were in­formed that the com­pany he worked with could no longer pay their salaries.</p>
    <p>He opted for one-year no­pay leave over re­trench­ment.</p>
    <p>“I am still learn­ing car­pen­try... I hope I can make a liv­ing out of it. For now, I’m us­ing my sav­ings and govern­ment as­sis­tance to sur­vive,” said the cap­tain with 32 years of fly­ing un­der his belt.</p>
    <p>Most of the time, he spends his days at home read­ing the news on so­cial me­dia, hop­ing for a mir­a­cle. “Ques­tions like ‘how do I af­ford to pay for my house, car and ev­ery­thing else’... re­ally stress me out. It’s a dead end when­ever I think of how to gen­er­ate as much in­come as I used to.”</p>
    <p>An­other Malaysian pi­lot, who wanted to be known only as Mr Syed, said he has been help­ing his wife sell desserts, an en­ter­prise she started when Malaysia be­gan its move­ment curbs in March.</p>
    <p>While their small busi­ness is do­ing well, he ad­mit­ted that it was tough to start afresh. Like most pi­lots in Malaysia, he said, any qual­i­fi­ca­tion is of lit­tle value in other lines of work.</p>
    <p>He has been on no-pay leave since March, but de­cided to re­sign so that he could qual­ify for govern­ment as­sis­tance such as the Em­ploy­ment In­sur­ance Sys­tem, which pro­vides an al­lowance to those who have lost their jobs.</p>
    <p>Along with the re­duced pay, he and his fam­ily are adapt­ing to a sim­pler life­style. “We rarely go out any more, and we have not even trav­elled far from home yet. Since we have a four-year-old daugh­ter, we try to find ac­tiv­i­ties for her to do at home. We eat health­ier, home­cooked food, and when we don’t, we try not to splurge as much any more,” said Mr Syed.</p>
    <p>Filipino pi­lot Ralph Ri­cardo and his flight at­ten­dant wife Alexis are sell­ing dim sum on­line to make ends meet.</p>
    <p>“It’s no work, no pay, and the flights are very lim­ited be­cause of the pan­demic, so we’ve had to look for ex­tra in­come,” Ms Ri­cardo told GMA News.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple forked out 15,000 pe­sos (S$420) when they launched the busi­ness in June. They have since been earn­ing three times as much.</p>
