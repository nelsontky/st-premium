    <p>Ger­man foot­ball and clubs have noth­ing to fear from other Euro­pean leagues and have all the tools nec­es­sary to dom­i­nate the con­ti­nent, for­mer Germany cap­tain Lothar Matthaus said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>And at the fore­front are Bay­ern Mu­nich, who won the tre­ble last sea­son and de­mol­ished Barcelona 8-2 in the Cham­pi­ons League quar­ter-fi­nals.</p>
    <p>In a con­fer­ence call with Asian me­dia, Matthaus, who spent 12 years over two spells with the Bavar­ian giants and skip­pered Germany to vic­tory at the 1990 World Cup, said: “Ger­man foot­ball is get­ting bet­ter and bet­ter. We re­spect the (English) Premier League, Span­ish and Ital­ian leagues, but I think we don’t have to be afraid of th­ese big names and big teams.”</p>
    <p>All six Bun­desliga teams – Bay­ern, Borus­sia Dort­mund, RB Leipzig, Borus­sia Monchengla­d­bach, Bayer Lev­erkusen and Hof­fen­heim – in­volved in Europe at the start of the sea­son have qual­i­fied for the knock­out stages of the Cham­pi­ons League and Europa League.</p>
    <p>Bay­ern striker Robert Le­wandowski is also the reign­ing Best Fifa Men’s Player win­ner, the first from the Bun­desliga.</p>
    <p>Alphonso Davies, Thi­ago Al­can­tara, Joshua Kim­mich – part of the Bay­ern side who won the quin­tu­ple last sea­son – were also named in the FIFPro World XI.</p>
    <p>Among the elite leagues in Europe, the Bun­desliga was the best at­tended league from 2013 to 2018, with an av­er­age crowd size of 43,302, fol­lowed by the Premier League (36,675) and Spain’s La Liga (27,381).</p>
    <p>IN THE BIG LEAGUES</p>
    <p>Matthaus, 59, said: “We play on the high­est level. The Bun­desliga has good clubs, we have nice sta­di­ums, we have a great at­mos­phere.</p>
    <p>“I’ve fol­lowed more in­ter­na­tional foot­ball in the last nine months than be­fore and we’ve seen the qual­ity of Ger­man foot­ball in the re­sults of last year’s Cham­pi­ons League. You can play in the first four or five clubs in the Bun­desliga and have the same qual­ity as the Premier League.”</p>
    <p>The Ger­man league fea­tures some of the planet’s bright­est tal­ents in Bay­ern’s Davies and Dort­mund duo Er­ling Haa­land and Jadon San­cho, but the Bun­desliga’s fi­nan­cial power pales in com­par­i­son to the Premier League.</p>
    <p>De­spite the coron­avirus pan­demic, top-flight clubs in Eng­land spent £1.26 bil­lion (S$2.27 bil­lion) on trans­fers last sum­mer, while their coun­ter­parts in Germany in­vested only £290.43 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Bay­ern may have lured Germany winger Leroy Sane from Manch­ester City but his com­pa­tri­ots Timo Werner (Leipzig) and Kai Havertz (Lev­erkusen) were poached by Chelsea in mega trans­fer deals in the sum­mer.</p>
    <p>The dom­i­nance of Bay­ern – they are seek­ing a nine straight league cham­pi­onship this term – may have led crit­ics to la­bel the Bun­desliga a “farm­ers league” but Matthaus in­sists this win­ning run has not been as easy as it seems.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent cam­paign il­lus­trates the com­pet­i­tive­ness of the com­pe­ti­tion, he noted.</p>
    <p>Bay­ern are top but only two points clear of Leipzig and ap­pear vul­ner­a­ble. Without the de­parted Philippe Coutinho, Ivan Perisic and Al­can­tara, Bay­ern are also weaker than last year.</p>
    <p>Matthaus, who is a Bun­desliga am­bas­sador, said: “Leipzig has been im­prov­ing a lot in the past few years and they’ve made the next step even though they lost Werner and (Pa­trik) Schick.</p>
    <p>“They’ve found their way and have a very good bench. They have 18, 19, 20 play­ers on the same level who can play two dif­fer­ent sys­tems. This will be a long fight for the Bun­desliga ti­tle between th­ese two teams.”</p>
    <p>You can play in the first four or five clubs in the Bun­desliga and have the same qual­ity as the Premier League.</p>
