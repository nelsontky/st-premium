    <p>NEW YORK • It has been a long nine months for Andy Mur­ray. Last Oc­to­ber, he won his first ATP ti­tle – over two years af­ter his last – at An­twerp de­spite un­der­go­ing hip resur­fac­ing surgery, lead­ing to sev­eral months out and per­sis­tent re­tire­ment ru­mours.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the mo­men­tum was de­railed by a com­bi­na­tion of more com­pli­ca­tions caused by the op­er­a­tion and then Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The Scot was out of ac­tion for the first three months of the sea­son, in­clud­ing the year’s first Grand Slam, the Aus­tralian Open, and just when he was ready to re­turn to the Tour, the coro­n­avirus pan­demic broke out, lead­ing to a five-month stop­page of the men’s cir­cuit.</p>
    <p>With barely any play un­der his belt – the Western & South­ern Open will be his only warm-up be­fore the US Open, which starts next Mon­day – the 33-year-old is not go­ing into the hard-court Ma­jor with any ex­pec­ta­tions other than to get a feel of top-level ten­nis again.</p>
    <p>“I know that the ten­nis will come but it’s not gonna come back im­me­di­ately, so it’s just not to ex­pect straight off the bat to be play­ing per­fect,” the three-time Grand Slam win­ner said af­ter beat­ing Amer­i­can and fel­low wild card Francis Ti­afoe 7-6 (8-6), 3-6, 6-1 in the first round on Satur­day in New York.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, in the first set to­day, the tiebreak was a bad level. It was not good ten­nis, in my opin­ion.</p>
    <p>“But I got through it and I didn’t get too down on my­self and I didn’t ex­pect to play un­be­liev­able to­day.</p>
    <p>“I spoke with my coach the last cou­ple of days and he was say­ing to me, ‘You’re good enough to win matches even when you’re not feel­ing good’.”</p>
    <p>On the lengthy lay­off, Mur­ray re­vealed he had “done more (gym work) in these last four months than I prob­a­bly have in my ca­reer”.</p>
    <p>His sec­ond-round op­po­nent, sev­enth-ranked Alexan­der Zverev of Ger­many, will be a sterner test of his fit­ness – the pair faced each other only once in 2016 – but the former world No. 1 is more per­turbed by the ab­sence of fans.</p>
    <p>Like the US Open, the Western & South­ern Open is be­ing held in the same Covid-19 “bub­ble” de­signed to min­imise the risk of con­tract­ing the virus, mean­ing no spec­ta­tors are present at ei­ther event.</p>
    <p>On ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a closed-door tour­na­ment for the first time, Mur­ray said: “There isn’t re­ally an at­mos­phere, to be hon­est with you...</p>
    <p>“In dif­fi­cult mo­ments, the crowd be­ing there maybe helps you fo­cus a lit­tle more and some­times, gives you that lit­tle ex­tra boost in terms of your en­ergy or your con­cen­tra­tion. That’s not there and it’s cer­tainly dif­fer­ent in that re­spect.” ATP WESTERN & SOUTH­ERN OPEN Day 3: StarHub Ch211, 11pm</p>
