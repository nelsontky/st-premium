    <p>• China’s im­ports grew at their fastest pace this year last month, while ex­ports ex­tended strong gains as more trad­ing part­ners lifted coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions in a fur­ther boost to the world’s sec­ond­biggest econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Ex­ports last month rose 9.9 per cent from a year ear­lier, Cus­toms data showed yesterday, broadly in line with an­a­lysts’ ex­pec­ta­tions and up from a solid 9.5 per cent in­crease in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>The strong trade per­for­mance sug­gests Chi­nese ex­porters are mak­ing a brisk re­cov­ery from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic’s im­pact on over­seas or­ders. As the global econ­omy restarts, Chi­nese firms are rush­ing to grab mar­ket share as their ri­vals grap­ple with re­duced man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>“A jump in im­ports sug­gests that do­mes­tic in­vest­ment spend­ing re­mains strong,” Cap­i­tal Eco­nom­ics se­nior China econ­o­mist Ju­lian Evans-Pritchard said. “Mean­while, ex­ports re­mained strong, most likely thanks to the re­cent strength of re­tail sales among China’s ma­jor trad­ing part­ners.”</p>
    <p>But some an­a­lysts warn that ex­ports could peak soon as de­mand for Chi­nese-made pro­tec­tive gear re­cedes and the base ef­fect of this year’s mas­sive de­clines wears off. Im­ports surged 13.2 per cent, re­turn­ing to growth from a fall of 2.1 per cent in Au­gust and much stronger than ex­pec­ta­tions for a 0.3 per cent in­crease.</p>
    <p>Zhongyuan Bank chief econ­o­mist Wang Jun said the data showed gov­ern­ment sup­port for the econ­omy has kicked in as the pan­demic comes un­der con­trol. “This has boosted do­mes­tic de­mand, es­pe­cially in­vest­ment-led de­mand, which buoyed im­ports,” Mr Wang said. “The other fac­tor is the yuan’s re­cent ap­pre­ci­a­tion, which is good for im­ports and peo­ple’s spend­ing power.”</p>
    <p>The rise in im­ports pushed the trade sur­plus for last month down to US$37 bil­lion (S$50.3 bil­lion), com­pared with US$58.93 bil­lion in Au­gust and lower than an ex­pected US$58 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Al­ready height­ened US-China tensions are ex­pected to es­ca­late ahead of the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion. China re­mains well be­hind on its pledge to boost pur­chases of US goods un­der an agree­ment that was launched in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>China’s trade sur­plus with the United States nar­rowed to US$30.75 bil­lion last month from US$34.24 bil­lion in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Top US and Chi­nese trade of­fi­cials reaf­firmed their com­mit­ment to a phase one trade deal in a phone call in Au­gust. How­ever, US Agri­cul­ture Sec­re­tary Sonny Per­due cast doubt ear­lier this month on the like­li­hood of China meet­ing its com­mit­ment to pur­chase enough agri­cul­tural prod­ucts as promised in its phase one trade deal.</p>
