    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has been a mon­u­men­tal test of the na­tion’s spirit, but Sin­ga­pore will emerge stronger and more united than be­fore, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong pledged. While the fight con­tin­ues, Sin­ga­pore has man­aged to sta­bilise the sit­u­a­tion be­cause Sin­ga­pore­ans have worked together and given the Gov­ern­ment their trust and sup­port, he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s suc­cess over the years, from build­ing up its econ­omy to tack­ling the on­go­ing Covid-19 cri­sis, has been pos­si­ble be­cause the coun­try man­aged to get its pol­i­tics right, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
    <p>And it is up to Sin­ga­pore­ans to en­sure it re­mains so, by be­ing en­gaged on the is­sues, send­ing the right sig­nals through their votes and re­ward­ing par­ties that de­liv­ered for the peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party, which helped build the coun­try with the peo­ple, has a spe­cial duty to keep the sys­tem work­ing, pro­vid­ing the l ead­er­ship the coun­try needs and de­serves.</p>
    <p>“At the most fun­da­men­tal level, to make our pol­i­tics work, both the Gov­ern­ment and the op­po­si­tion must share an over­rid­ing ob­jec­tive – to work for Sin­ga­pore, and not just for our party or our sup­port­ers,” he added yes­ter­day, when he rose to join the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress to the open­ing of Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>That would make it pos­si­ble to have pol­icy de­bates based on prin­ci­ples and fact, guided by shared ideals and goals, in­clud­ing pro­tect­ing Sin­ga­pore’s se­cu­rity, grow­ing its econ­omy and se­cur­ing its fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“If we do that, then there’s a ba­sis for us to man­age the i nher­ent ten­sions in our sys­tem, and for pol­i­tics to work out pro­duc­tively,” he said, but cau­tioned that it was not a given that the vir­tu­ous cir­cle would con­tinue.</p>
    <p>Else­where, pol­i­tics has be­come in­creas­ingly toxic and bit­ter, is­sues are politi­cised and gov­ern­ments paral­ysed by par­ti­san bick­er­ing, leav­ing coun­tries di­vided and on a spi­ral down­wards.</p>
    <p>“If this hap­pens to Sin­ga­pore, we will not just cease be­ing an ex­cep­tional na­tion, it will be the end of us. We must not go down this path.”</p>
    <p>While there is no guar­an­tee that even un­der a PAP gov­ern­ment, Sin­ga­pore will for­ever be suc­cess­ful, PM Lee called on Sin­ga­pore­ans to work with and keep faith with the Gov­ern­ment, a for­mula that has served the coun­try well.</p>
    <p>In a wide-rang­ing 90-minute speech broad­cast live, he also spoke on Sin­ga­pore’s on­go­ing bat­tle against Covid-19 and noted that the na­tion has man­aged, af­ter eight gru­elling months, to sta­bilise the sit­u­a­tion, with one of the world’s low­est fa­tal­ity rates. This had called for a tremen­dous ef­fort, with Sin­ga­pore­ans work­ing together and giv­ing the Gov­ern­ment their trust and sup­port, he said.</p>
    <p>The same com­pact will be cru­cial as the coun­try nav­i­gates a changed world that re­quires stronger safety nets, the thorny is­sue of for­eign worker pol­icy, and evolv­ing pol­i­tics given the greater de­sire for op­po­si­tion voices in Par­lia­ment, he said.</p>
    <p>There was a need for more ro­bust safety nets go­ing for­ward, he said, cit­ing greater eco­nomic un­cer­tainty and the long-term trends of an age­ing pop­u­la­tion and ris­ing health­care costs.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment is not ide­o­log­i­cally op­posed to any so­lu­tions raised, he added. But it is im­per­a­tive these safety nets are fis­cally sus­tain­able and do not cre­ate new prob­lems in them­selves, like erod</p>
    <p>ing the spirit of self-re­liance.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is also re­view­ing its for­eign worker cri­te­ria, given the slack in the job mar­ket due to the down­turn. Yet it must be care­ful not to give the wrong im­pres­sion that it no longer wel­comes for­eign­ers, as its suc­cess is pred­i­cated on be­ing an in­ter­na­tional hub that serves a global mar­ket, he said.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing up the hot but­ton is­sue of for­eign­ers com­pet­ing with Sin­ga­pore­ans for jobs, which had dom­i­nated the first two days of the de­bate, he said: “The Gov­ern­ment will al­ways be on the side of Sin­ga­pore­ans. What is the point of cre­at­ing jobs for for­eign­ers if it does not ben­e­fit Sin­ga­pore­ans?”</p>
    <p>He added: “We may be un­der stress now, but we can­not turn in­wards. We will ad­just our poli­cies to safe­guard Sin­ga­porean jobs, but let us show con­fi­dence that Sin­ga­pore­ans can hold their own in the world.”</p>
    <p>A spir­ited ex­change with Leader of the Op­po­si­tion Pri­tam Singh fol­lowed PM Lee’s speech, in which he said he had lis­tened care­fully to Mr Singh spell­ing out on Mon­day how he planned to go about his new role. “I ap­plaud his tone and ap­proach. The gov­ern­ment benches will do our part to work with him, to keep Par­lia­ment a con­struc­tive fo­rum for de­bate,” PM Lee said.</p>
    <p>He added that it was good to have an ad­e­quate num­ber of op­po­si­tion MPs in the House, to keep the Gov­ern­ment on its toes. But he warned that the op­po­si­tion’s tac­tic of urg­ing vot­ers to back it, as­sum­ing the PAP would still be around to form the gov­ern­ment, was flawed.</p>
    <p>“At what point does a vote for a strong op­po­si­tion be­come a vote for a dif­fer­ent gov­ern­ment?” he asked.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing, Mr Singh said he and his col­leagues were sin­cere in stand­ing for elec­tion to en­sure an op­po­si­tion pres­ence, not be­cause he was “des­per­ate for power” or had dreams of form­ing a gov­ern­ment. Like­wise, in pos­ing ques­tions such as on the use of the na­tion’s re­serves, they were seek­ing good out­comes for Sin­ga­pore and not out of a de­sire of “raid­ing them”, he said.</p>
    <p>PM Lee con­cluded his speech on a rous­ing note. Covid-19, like so many other chal­lenges that Sin­ga­pore has faced, would be a “plat­form for am­bi­tion and dar­ing”, he said, pledg­ing that the na­tion would emerge stronger and more united from the cri­sis, as it had done in the past.</p>
    <p>“We are here by dint of will and imag­i­na­tion, in de­fi­ance of all the odds. And of all those who said we wouldn’t make it, we did.</p>
    <p>“Do not doubt. Do not fear. Jewel will shine again. Changi will thrive again. SIA will be a great way to fly once more. Our econ­omy will pros­per anew,” he said.</p>
    <p>Chok­ing up as he con­cluded, PM Lee said: “Our chil­dren and our grand­chil­dren will con­tinue march­ing for­ward to build a fairer, ev­er­more just and equal so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has done well in han­dling the coro­n­avirus pan­demic so far in terms of health out­comes, though its re­sponse was not with­out short­com­ings, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
    <p>Join­ing the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day, he noted that the coun­try’s fa­tal­ity rate is one of the low­est in the world, with new in­fec­tions in the com­mu­nity down to just a hand­ful a day and fewer than 100 pa­tients re­main­ing in hospi­tals.</p>
    <p>With hind­sight, the Gov­ern­ment would have done some things dif­fer­ently, he said.</p>
    <p>Had it known ear­lier that Covid-19 pa­tients were asymp­to­matic, it would have quar­an­tined all Sin­ga­pore­ans who re­turned home from abroad in March, in­stead of only those re­turn­ing from cer­tain coun­tries.</p>
    <p>He added that they would have also been tested be­fore be­ing re­leased from quar­an­tine, even if they did not show any symp­toms, in­stead of as­sum­ing that no symp­toms meant no in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment would have also rec­om­mended the wear­ing of face masks sooner, said PM Lee, not­ing that it took the best avail­able sci­en­tific ad­vice at the time and changed its pol­icy once the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion recog­nised that asymp­to­matic trans­mis­sion was a ma­jor prob­lem.</p>
    <p>PM Lee also said the au­thor­i­ties would have acted more quickly and ag­gres­sively to con­trol the rapid spread of the dis­ease in mi­grant worker dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment knew that com­mu­nal liv­ing in dorms posed an in­fec­tion risk and stepped up pre­cau­tions, which seemed ad­e­quate, un­til the big­ger clus­ters broke out and threat­ened to over­whelm it, he said.</p>
    <p>“All this is wis­dom af­ter the fact. We must learn from these er­rors, and do bet­ter the next time,” he said. “In the fog of war, it is not pos­si­ble al­ways to make the per­fect de­ci­sions. Yet we have to de­cide and move. We can­not af­ford to wait.”</p>
    <p>Due to the scale and com­plex­ity of Sin­ga­pore’s re­sponse to Covid-19, there have in­evitably been some “rough edges”, said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>He cited the for­eign worker dor­mi­tory sit­u­a­tion, and how work is be­ing done to help work­ers get back to their jobs now that dorms have been cleared of the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>This has to be done safely be­cause of the risk of re-emerg­ing cases, he said, ac­knowl­edg­ing this was a com­pli­cated ex­er­cise that has made things dif­fi­cult for em­ploy­ers, es­pe­cially con­trac­tors, who have to deal with new rules even as they try to re­vive their busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>“But I hope they un­der­stand that we are do­ing our best to smooth things out, and are do­ing all this in or­der to keep our peo­ple safe.”</p>
    <p>And while many coun­tries talked about let­ting the dis­ease spread to de­velop herd im­mu­nity early on, PM Lee said Sin­ga­pore avoided do­ing so, as it would cause many here to get ill and die, es­pe­cially the old and vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>The Prime Minister added: “We were de­ter­mined, right from the very be­gin­ning, not to go down that route. We did our ut­most to con­tain the out­break and keep Sin­ga­pore­ans safe. And this meant mo­bil­is­ing all our na­tional re­sources.”</p>
    <p>Through the build­ing up of con­tact trac­ing and test­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties, Sin­ga­pore is now able to do 20,000 lab­o­ra­tory tests daily, noted PM Lee, adding that the coun­try can test sev­eral times that num­ber of peo­ple due to pooled test­ing.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore ex­panded its health­care sys­tem to treat a high num­ber of cases – dou­bling its in­ten­sive care unit ca­pac­ity and set­ting up tem­po­rary com­mu­nity care and iso­la­tion fa­cil­i­ties. This, said PM Lee, al­lowed it to cre­ate more beds than in all its acute hospi­tals put together, all within a few weeks.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, he also held up the work done by the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces and the Home Team in han­dling the sit­u­a­tion in the mi­grant worker dorms.</p>
    <p>And touch­ing on the circuit breaker pe­riod Sin­ga­pore went through from early April to June, he said that the Gov­ern­ment had timed it right to slow down the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“Each of these op­er­a­tions was huge, and all of them had to be done in par­al­lel. Thanks to the heroic ef­forts of many un­sung he­roes, work­ing qui­etly be­hind the scenes, we got here to­day,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore could not have mounted its Covid-19 re­sponse with­out the pub­lic ser­vice, PM Lee said, which worked tire­lessly to build new ca­pa­bil­i­ties and stepped up out­side of its scope of work.</p>
    <p>The po­lit­i­cal lead­er­ship played a key role, and he noted that with­out the Cab­i­net, the pub­lic ser­vice alone could not have done its job.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ters de­fined pri­or­i­ties, made ma­jor de­ci­sions and di­rected civil ser­vants in im­ple­ment­ing Covid-19 re­sponse mea­sures. They also worked to win pub­lic sup­port and took re­spon­si­bil­ity for these ef­forts, said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses pitched in by putting their peo­ple to work on so­lu­tions to bol­ster the na­tion­wide Covid-19 fight by tak­ing steps like set­ting up mask pro­duc­tion lines, scour­ing the world for test equip­ment and con­struct­ing care fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>But crit­i­cal to the suc­cess of Sin­ga­pore’s pan­demic re­sponse was the co­op­er­a­tion of its cit­i­zens. De­spite how se­verely af­fected their lives were, they com­plied with the mea­sures, said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans un­der­stood the need for tough and painful mea­sures, he noted, and they took these on calmly and sto­ically, as they had con­fi­dence that the Gov­ern­ment would see them through the cri­sis and be­yond.</p>
    <p>“I am very grate­ful for their co­op­er­a­tion and sup­port. Their sup­port will re­main cru­cial as we con­tinue the fight to keep Sin­ga­pore­ans safe,” he said.</p>
