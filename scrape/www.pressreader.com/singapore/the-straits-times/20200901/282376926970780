    <p>De­vel­op­ment charges (DC) have been cut for com­mer­cial, ho­tel and other land use, with large de­creases for cen­tral ar­eas such as Shen­ton Way, Ma­rina Bay Sands and Or­chard Road.</p>
    <p>The largest cuts in the lat­est hal­fyearly re­view were for two main prop­erty use groups that have been most af­fected by the Covid-19 pan­demic – hos­pi­tal­ity and med­i­cal; and com­mer­cial.</p>
    <p>Charges for ho­tel and hos­pi­tal de­vel­op­ment use have been slashed by an av­er­age 7.8 per cent, while those for com­mer­cial use were re­duced by 3.6 per cent on av­er­age.</p>
    <p>This is the first time that DC rates for com­mer­cial land have been low­ered since they be­gan trend­ing up in September 2016, noted JLL Sin­ga­pore re­search and con­sul­tancy head Tay Huey Ying yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The largest re­duc­tion – 7 per cent – ap­plies to ar­eas 11, 12, 41 and 42, which in­clude dis­tricts with a high con­cen­tra­tion of tourist ameni­ties and malls such as the Bayfront area, Cairn­hill Road, Som­er­set Road and Shen­ton Way.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses in th­ese ar­eas are the most af­fected by the fall­out from the pan­demic, noted Ms Tay.</p>
    <p>“Travel bans and cur­tail­ment had kept for­eign vis­i­tors away while do­mes­tic shop­pers have fallen as they turned to e-com­merce or shop and dine near home,” she added.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Na­tional De­vel­op­ment (MND) an­nounce­ment yes­ter­day noted that for com­mer­cial use, 110 out of the 118 sec­tors have had DC rates re­duced by 3 to 7 per cent while eight were left un­changed.</p>
    <p>Rates for hos­pi­tal­ity sites were left flat af­ter the pre­vi­ous two re­views, but the se­vere im­pact the in­dus­try has taken amid the pan­demic has led to the big­gest cuts this time – around 7.8 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ms Tricia Song, head of re­search for Sin­ga­pore at Col­liers In­ter­na­tional, noted that it is the largest de­cline since they fell 9.6 per cent in March 2009.</p>
    <p>“De­spite a dearth of ac­tual ho­tel trans­ac­tions, the de­cline in DC rates is re­flec­tive of the op­er­at­ing con­di­tions for ho­tels given the sharp de­clines in global travel and rev­enues,” she said.</p>
    <p>The lack of sales this year is in stark con­trast to 2019 when hos­pi­tal­ity trans­ac­tions hit a record $5.7 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The DC rates for res­i­den­tial non­landed use also de­creased – down by 0.8 per cent on av­er­age and the fourth con­sec­u­tive down­ward re­vi­sion. Rates for in­dus­try use de­creased by 0.9 per cent.</p>
    <p>Th­ese smaller de­clines show that res­i­den­tial and in­dus­trial prop­er­ties have been rel­a­tively more re­silient dur­ing the pan­demic, said Ms Song.</p>
    <p>MND re­vises the rates on March 1 and Sept 1 each year, in con­sul­ta­tion with the tax­man’s chief val­uer.</p>
    <p>Rates re­main un­changed for landed res­i­den­tial, place of worship/civic and community in­sti­tu­tion uses as well as for three other land-use groups: na­ture re­serves; agri­cul­tural land; drains, roads, rail­ways and ceme­ter­ies.</p>
    <p>Ms Tay said the DC cuts re­flect the wary ap­proach be­ing taken by firms now: “Most busi­nesses are likely stay­ing cau­tious on their space re­quire­ments and hence con­tinue to weigh on both rents and prices in the com­ing quar­ters.”</p>
