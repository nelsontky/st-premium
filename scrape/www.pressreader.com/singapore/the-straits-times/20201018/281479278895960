    <p>A day af­ter the Na­tional Wages Coun­cil is­sued fresh guide­lines on pay, tri­par­tite part­ners fol­lowed up with an up­dated frame­work for re­trench­ments sig­nalling that the job sit­u­a­tion ahead re­mains grim.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers must en­sure ob­jec­tive cri­te­ria, such as abil­ity, ex­pe­ri­ence and skills, are used should they need to re­trench work­ers. They should also lean to­wards re­tain­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans, while recog­nis­ing the im­por­tance of per­ma­nent res­i­dents in their work­force.</p>
    <p>“The tri­par­tite ad­vi­sory on manag­ing ex­cess man­power and re­spon­si­ble re­trench­ment calls on em­ploy­ers to lean in favour of Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens,” said a Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) spokesman.</p>
    <p>“It also recog­nises the im­por­tance of al­low­ing em­ploy­ers to re­tain ca­pa­ble PRs as part of their lo­cal work­force. The pri­mary con­sid­er­a­tions are the merit and skills of the in­di­vid­u­als and how they help to keep the busi­ness vi­able.”</p>
    <p>The ad­vi­sory was pre­vi­ously up­dated in March to lay out op­tions em­ploy­ers have be­sides re­trench­ment, such as train­ing or “time bank­ing” un­used work­ing hours to be re­paid when busi­ness picks up.</p>
    <p>The lat­est up­dates re­leased yes­ter­day were made jointly by MOM, the Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion (SNEF) and come amid con­cern that lay­offs may rise given the Covid-19 pan­demic. The first six months of 2020 saw 11,350 re­trench­ments.</p>
    <p>The ad­vi­sory re­it­er­ates that re­trench­ments should be a last re­sort. In the event re­trench­ments are in­evitable, em­ploy­ers should se­lect staff to let go based on ob­jec­tive cri­te­ria such as merit, and pre­serve those with skills to sup­port busi­ness sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>And they should take a longterm view of their man­power needs, in­clud­ing the need to main­tain “a strong Sin­ga­porean core”.</p>
    <p>“Re­trench­ments should gen­er­ally not re­sult in a re­duced pro­por­tion of lo­cal em­ploy­ees. This can be achieved by re­tain­ing pro­por­tion­ately more lo­cals dur­ing a re­trench­ment ex­er­cise,” the guide­lines say.</p>
    <p>When busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties pick up later, em­ploy­ers should make a “de­lib­er­ate ef­fort” to strengthen their lo­cal work­force by hir­ing lo­cals when they are able to do so.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will stay open and wel­com­ing to for­eign­ers who can help grow the econ­omy and cre­ate good jobs for lo­cals, the guide­lines add.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal em­ploy­ees are also en­cour­aged to ac­quire new ca­pa­bil­i­ties from for­eign em­ploy­ees with spe­cialised skills, while com­pa­nies should put in ef­fort so these skills can be trans­ferred to lo­cals.</p>
    <p>The up­dated ad­vi­sory em­pha­sises the need to safe­guard firms’ Sin­ga­porean core dur­ing re­trench­ment ex­er­cises, said NTUC deputy sec­re­tary-gen­eral Cham Hui Fong.</p>
    <p>She also urged com­pa­nies to no­tify unions early so that NTUC’s Job Se­cu­rity Coun­cil and Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute (e2i) can help af­fected work­ers quickly.</p>
    <p>The up­date also spells out how em­ploy­ers can con­duct a re­trench­ment ex­er­cise in a re­spon­si­ble and sen­si­tive way. These in­clude no­ti­fy­ing work­ers ear­lier than re­quired, and in per­son.</p>
    <p>Af­fected em­ploy­ees should also be given the time and space to ad­just to news of their re­trench­ment be­fore they are asked to va­cate the work­place. If nec­es­sary, coun­selling sup­port should be of­fered to re­trenched em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>If the com­pany is unionised, rel­e­vant unions should be in­formed of any re­trench­ment plans early, typ­i­cally one month be­fore the af­fected em­ploy­ees are no­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>To guide em­ploy­ers, the ad­vi­sory also now in­cludes a check­list of re­spon­si­ble re­trench­ment prac­tices.</p>
    <p>An MOM spokesman said yes­ter­day that of the few com­plaints re­ceived on dis­crim­i­na­tory re­trench­ments, in­ves­ti­ga­tions show that the em­ploy­ers were able to demon­strate mea­sures taken to up­keep the Sin­ga­porean core. “If com­pa­nies act ir­re­spon­si­bly in cost-sav­ing mea­sures or re­trench­ments, the Gov­ern­ment will con­sider deny­ing them fu­ture gov­ern­ment sup­port or sus­pend­ing their work pass priv­i­leges,” the spokesman said. “So far, the au­thor­i­ties have not had to do so.”</p>
    <p>Be­fore em­ploy­ers im­ple­ment wage cuts to save jobs, they should con­sider and im­ple­ment other cost­sav­ing mea­sures first, ac­cord­ing to the lat­est guide­lines on re­spon­si­ble re­trench­ment prac­tices.</p>
    <p>The lat­est tri­par­tite ad­vi­sory on manag­ing ex­cess man­power and re­spon­si­ble re­trench­ment re­leased yes­ter­day lays out the var­i­ous cost­cut­ting op­tions em­ploy­ers can con­sider be­fore re­trench­ing work­ers.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers who want to scale down or sus­pend busi­ness op­er­a­tions be­cause of a short and tem­po­rary de­cline in busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties can con­sider mak­ing ad­just­ments to work ar­range­ments with or with­out wage cuts, while those with lit­tle prospect for the long run may find di­rect wage cuts and no-pay leave more suit­able op­tions.</p>
    <p>A Min­istry of Man­power spokesman noted that “only a small mi­nor­ity” of all the com­pa­nies that have sub­mit­ted no­ti­fi­ca­tions on cost-sav­ing mea­sures so far went on to carry out a re­trench­ment ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>Un­der the tri­par­tite ad­vi­sory, ad­just­ments to work ar­range­ments with­out wage cuts in­clude re­de­ploy­ing em­ploy­ees to other ar­eas of work within the com­pany if it is un­der­go­ing struc­tural changes.</p>
    <p>In such cases, rel­e­vant train­ing should be pro­vided.</p>
    <p>If there are no other avail­able jobs for the af­fected em­ploy­ees within the com­pany, an­other op­tion is to out­place them to suit­able jobs in other com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers can also con­sider im­ple­ment­ing a flex­i­ble work sched­ule, which in­volves cre­at­ing a “time bank” of un­used work­ing hours while still pay­ing work­ers their monthly wages.</p>
    <p>The banked hours can be “re­paid” to the em­ployer later, when busi­ness picks up and longer work­ing hours are needed.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, ad­just­ments to work ar­range­ments with wage cuts in­clude mea­sures such as of­fer­ing part-time work, short­en­ing the work week or tem­po­rary lay­offs.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers who are fac­ing dire busi­ness con­di­tions that are un­likely to im­prove in the long term may con­sider di­rect wage cuts, but should con­sult the rel­e­vant unions and their em­ploy­ees to reach an agree­ment be­fore im­ple­ment­ing them, the ad­vi­sory stated.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies that have a flex­i­ble wage sys­tem in place can ad­just var­i­ous wage com­po­nents to re­duce man­power costs.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, the vari­able bonus pay­ment can be re­duced or not given when a com­pany is not per­form­ing well.</p>
    <p>The an­nual wage sup­ple­ment, or 13th month bonus, which is usu­ally one month’s wage paid at the end of the year, can be re­duced if busi­ness con­di­tions con­tinue to worsen.</p>
    <p>To re­spond quickly to changes in the busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment, em­ploy­ers can re­duce the monthly vari­able com­po­nent (MVC), which forms part of the monthly ba­sic wage.</p>
    <p>This means the em­ployer will not have to wait un­til the end of the year to ad­just the vari­able bonus pay­ment or other an­nual vari­able com­po­nents.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies that have not yet im­ple­mented the MVC can con­sider treat­ing any cut in ba­sic wages of up to 10 per cent as a cut in MVC, which should be re­stored later when the busi­ness re­cov­ers.</p>
    <p>No-pay leave should be con­sid­ered only af­ter em­ploy­ers have con­sid­ered other mea­sures and have con­sulted the rel­e­vant unions and its em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Mr Sim Gim Guan, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion, said in a state­ment that em­ploy­ers should con­sider busi­ness sus­tain­abil­ity and long-term man­power needs.</p>
    <p>If re­trench­ments are in­evitable af­ter ex­haust­ing other op­tions, they should carry out the ex­er­cise with em­pa­thy and care, he added.</p>
    <p>“We also en­cour­age em­ploy­ers to main­tain a strong Sin­ga­porean core so that they would have the ca­pa­bil­i­ties and ca­pac­i­ties to seize op­por­tu­ni­ties when the econ­omy starts to re­cover,” he said.</p>
