    <p>BEI­JING • Tem­per­a­tures in Bei­jing were set to plum­met to a three­decade low overnight yes­ter­day, but that did not stop a hardy group of re­tirees from plung­ing into icy waters to in­dulge in their brac­ing hobby of out­door swim­ming.</p>
    <p>As the mer­cury fell to mi­nus 11 deg C in the Chi­nese cap­i­tal by the af­ter­noon – and was forecast to dip as low as mi­nus 18 deg C overnight – around 15 swim­mers jumped into icy out­door waters of a lake at a city park.</p>
    <p>“It’s cold in the wa­ter, but you will feel good when you come out,” said 60-year-old Nie Bing, emerg­ing from the icy depths.</p>
    <p>Wear­ing swim­suits, gog­gles, hats, wa­ter shoes and socks and even gloves, the band of hardy swim­mers take to the wa­ter ev­ery day for a dip, what­ever t he weather.</p>
    <p>In mid-win­ter, they of­ten have to break the ice that forms over the lake, sweep­ing sheets of it to one side with a fish­ing rod to cre­ate swim­ming lanes.</p>
    <p>Nearby, less hardy souls, bun­dled up in lay­ers against the chill, glided across the frozen lake on their ice skates.</p>
    <p>“The colder it is, the more you want to swim,” af­firmed an­other swimmer, sur­named Zhang, who said he is in his 70s.</p>
    <p>China’s me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal au­thor­ity has is­sued a se­vere weather warn­ing for large parts of the coun­try, alert­ing peo­ple to dras­tic tem­per­a­ture drops and strong gales.</p>
    <p>In Bei­jing, strong winds were pre­dicted to drag the ground tem­per­a­ture down to below mi­nus 30 de­grees C overnight.</p>
    <p>As the swim­ming troupe emerged from the lake, some doused them­selves in warm wa­ter and watched the steam rise off their bod­ies.</p>
    <p>Af­ter their daily swim, they bun­dle up in warm clothes and gather on the banks to sing songs to­gether.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhang did ad­mit that the tem­per­a­ture felt “colder than usual” – but said it was no cause for con­cern. “I’ve swam in colder weather than this,” he said.</p>
