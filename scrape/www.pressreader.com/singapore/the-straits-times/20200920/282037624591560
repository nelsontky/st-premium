    <p>Be­fore each mixed mar­tial arts (MMA) com­pe­ti­tion, Vic­to­ria Lee re­minds her­self of the ad­vice from her fa­ther Ken: Ig­nore the out­side chat­ter and fo­cus on the con­test ahead.</p>
    <p>It is a les­son she in­tends to heed as she em­barks on her big­gest chal­lenge as a pro­fes­sional fighter af­ter One Cham­pi­onship on Thurs­day an­nounced that the 16-year-old would be join­ing the MMA pro­mo­tion.</p>
    <p>Her age and abil­ity were im­me­di­ately called into ques­tion by scep­tics but Vic­to­ria, whose older sib­lings An­gela, 24, and Chris­tian, 22, are world cham­pi­ons with One and fight un­der the Sin­ga­pore flag, re­fused to al­low the crit­i­cism to af­fect her.</p>
    <p>One’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Cha­tri Si­ty­o­d­tong leapt to her de­fence on Fri­day, writ­ing in a Face­book post that he signed the teenager “en­tirely on her merit alone”.</p>
    <p>He added: “It had noth­ing to do with her sib­lings and their achieve­ments.</p>
    <p>“In fight­ing, skills trump age. If you have the skills to dom­i­nate in your weight class, it does not mat­ter how old you are.”</p>
    <p>The vote of con­fi­dence was wel­comed, Hawaii na­tive Vic­to­ria told The Sun­day Times in a video in­ter­view yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She said: “In com­pe­ti­tions, it’s very im­por­tant for your mind to be there. I think the best way to do that is to not think of so many things at once, just fo­cus on what I’m here to do and not lis­ten to all this out­side chat­ter.</p>
    <p>“I ap­pre­ci­ate what Mr Cha­tri has done – de­fend­ing me – but I’m just so ex­cited about what’s hap­pen­ing right now and I just don’t want to get down about any of that.”</p>
    <p>Back­ing her is a long list of cre­den­tials that in­clude be­ing a 15-time North Amer­i­can Grap­pling As­so­ci­a­tion Ex­pert Cham­pion and a twotime Pankra­tion Ju­nior World Cham­pion.</p>
    <p>Last year, she won the In­ter­na­tional Mixed Mar­tial Arts Fed­er­a­tion Ju­nior World Cham­pi­onship and the Hawaii State Wrestling Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>An­gela was also full of praise. One’s atom­weight world cham­pion said: “Vic­to­ria is a part of this next gen­er­a­tion that has been born and raised with MMA as a whole. The tran­si­tions are seam­less, there are no gaps.</p>
    <p>“She is still learn­ing and im­prov­ing each day but, yes, she is al­ready much bet­ter than I was at her age.”</p>
    <p>There are ex­pec­ta­tions that come along with be­ing the younger sis­ter of two world cham­pi­ons but Vic­to­ria is de­ter­mined to forge her own path.</p>
    <p>She said: “I use my brother and sis­ter as in­spi­ra­tion and mo­ti­va­tion for me. My dad has al­ways taught us to fo­cus on our own games, to not get side­tracked with all the out­side noise and just run our own race.”</p>
    <p>Mar­tial arts are a fam­ily af­fair – all three sib­lings and their youngest brother Adrian, 14 , are coached by their par­ents, Sin­ga­pore-born Ken and his South Korean wife Jewelz.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria, a ju­nior at Mililani High School, be­lieves that be­ing part of a fam­ily that loves the sport has played a big role in her de­vel­op­ment as an ath­lete.</p>
    <p>Her pro­fes­sional de­but has not been con­firmed, but she is al­ready rar­ing to get into the ring although she ruled out ever fac­ing An­gela – “we are fam­ily, so that would never hap­pen” – in a po­ten­tial atom­weight clash.</p>
    <p>While com­pe­ti­tions are halted due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, Vic­to­ria con­tin­ues to train five times a week in prepa­ra­tion for that maiden out­ing.</p>
    <p>“That feel­ing af­ter win­ning was just re­ally what made me want to just keep com­pet­ing,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I al­ways knew that I wanted to be­come a pro­fes­sional fighter. I never ex­pected it to hap­pen this fast, but I’m ex­tremely grate­ful for this op­por­tu­nity and I just can’t wait to com­pete.”</p>
    <p>In fight­ing, skills trump age. If you have the skills to dom­i­nate in your weight class, it does not mat­ter how old you are.</p>
