    <p>PRE­VENT­ING HEAT STRESS IN BULL­DOGS</p>
    <p>I have a French bull­dog that loves be­ing out­doors. I avoid tak­ing him out when the weather is too hot or hu­mid as I am afraid he will be over­heated. What are some symp­toms of heat ex­haus­tion? What should I be mind­ful of when my dog is over­heated? Cher Ang</p>
    <p>Dogs nat­u­rally get rid of ex­cess heat by pant­ing and, to a much lesser ex­tent, sweat­ing.</p>
    <p>Brachy­cephalic dog breeds, in­clud­ing the French bull­dog, are more sus­cep­ti­ble to heat stress as the struc­ture of their heads can af­fect their abil­ity to pant ef­fec­tively.</p>
    <p>Heat stress can then man­i­fest as ex­ces­sive pant­ing and in­creased thirst. If left un­man­aged, it can progress to heat ex­haus­tion and heat stroke, which has more se­vere signs such as weak­ness, col­lapse, dis­ori­en­ta­tion and seizures. Heat stroke can also po­ten­tially re­sult in mul­ti­ple or­gan fail­ure and death.</p>
    <p>To min­imise heat stress, avoid walk­ing your dog in direct sun­light dur­ing the hottest times of the day and never leave him tied up un­der the sun or locked in a car.</p>
    <p>If there are vis­i­ble signs of heat stress when out­side, take him to a wa­ter dis­penser and pro­vide fresh, cool drink­ing wa­ter.</p>
    <p>Take him to the vet if the signs of heat stress are pro­longed or not im­prov­ing de­spite tak­ing the mea­sures above.</p>
    <p>LOUD MEOWING WOR­RIES OWN­ERS</p>
    <p>My neutered 10-month-old male kit­ten has de­vel­oped a habit of meowing loudly and in­ces­santly be­tween 6 and 8am ev­ery day. We keep him out of the bed­room so he starts meowing at the door at that time if we are not up and about yet. He usu­ally gets kib­bles laid out at night be­fore mid­night. We have tried to dis­cour­age this con­stant meowing by ig­nor­ing him but he still keeps at it. Is there a way to change this be­hav­iour?</p>
    <p>Pauline Wee</p>
    <p>A de­tailed un­der­stand­ing of the cir­cum­stances sur­round­ing the be­hav­iour – in­clud­ing the en­vi­ron­ment, what hap­pens be­fore and af­ter the be­hav­iour, po­ten­tial mo­ti­va­tions for it, and what re­in­forces it – is im­por­tant in ad­dress­ing the is­sue.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, if food is the mo­ti­va­tion for his vo­cal­i­sa­tion, have you cal­cu­lated how much your kit­ten should be eat­ing daily?</p>
    <p>If he is not get­ting suf­fi­cient food to meet his re­quire­ments, he may be vo­cal­is­ing early in the morn­ing be­cause he is hun­gry. Per­haps you can ex­plore us­ing an au­to­matic feeder to dis­pense food at pre-set times of the day, tim­ing it just be­fore he starts vo­cal­is­ing.</p>
    <p>In some cases, the vo­cal­is­ing be­hav­iour could have been re­in­forced by what hap­pens af­ter he vo­calises. For ex­am­ple, he might have vo­calised to seek at­ten­tion or play.</p>
    <p>When he me­ows out­side the room door and you open it, this may have in­ad­ver­tently re­in­forced the be­hav­iour. This means he may re­peat the be­hav­iour when seek­ing at­ten­tion in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>If this is a con­tribut­ing fac­tor, you can sched­ule pre­dictable so­cial in­ter­ac­tions, in­clud­ing play and so­cial time, into his daily rou­tine. You can also in­crease the chances of your kit­ten sleep­ing through the night by sched­ul­ing ac­tive play­time be­fore bed.</p>
    <p>If his be­hav­iour con­tin­ues to cause prob­lems, seek help from an an­i­mal be­hav­iour con­sul­tant.</p>
