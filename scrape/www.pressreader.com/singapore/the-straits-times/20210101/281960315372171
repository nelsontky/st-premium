    <p>At this point, most of us have heard about al­ler­gic re­ac­tions to</p>
    <p>Covid-19 vac­cines: the doc­tor in Bos­ton who had to ad­min­is­ter his EpiPen, the hos­pi­tal worker in Alaska who had trou­ble breath­ing.</p>
    <p>But it’s not at all sur­pris­ing that al­ler­gic re­ac­tions hap­pen. What mat­ters most is the sever­ity and the rate at which they oc­cur. And for the coro­n­avirus vac­cines, there’s no doubt the value of vac­ci­na­tion out­weighs the risk.</p>
    <p>The Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion (CDC) is­sued up­dated guid­ance on ad­min­is­ter­ing the vac­cines on</p>
    <p>Dec 19. It noted that a small num­ber of peo­ple had ex­pe­ri­enced sig­nif­i­cant al­ler­gic re­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>The CDC rec­om­mended that ev­ery­one who re­ceived a vac­cine be ob­served for at least 15 min­utes. Those with a his­tory of se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tions to pretty much any­thing should be ob­served for 30 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Ana­phy­laxis – a po­ten­tially life-threat­en­ing al­ler­gic re­ac­tion – is noth­ing to be ig­nored. It’s most com­monly associated with al­ler­gies to foods, like peanuts, or bee stings, and it’s the rea­son many peo­ple carry EpiPens. Of­ten, im­me­di­ate ad­min­is­tra­tion of ep­i­neph­rine is the only thing that can pre­vent death.</p>
    <p>Even so, an av­er­age of around 60 peo­ple in the United States die each year from hor­net, wasp and bee stings and three times as many die from food al­ler­gies.</p>
    <p>When the CDC up­dated its guid­ance, at least six out of hun­dreds of thou­sands of re­cip­i­ents had ex­pe­ri­enced a se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tion, but all of them re­cov­ered with treat­ment.</p>
    <p>The news me­dia has cov­ered these re­ac­tions, and it’s un­der­stand­able that the pub­lic would be con­cerned about the dan­gers of new med­i­ca­tions, es­pe­cially ones that were de­vel­oped so quickly and un­der such enor­mous pres­sure.</p>
    <p>But put those num­bers in con­text: More than 2.1 mil­lion peo­ple in the US have re­ceived a dose of a vac­cine at this point. So far, ac­cord­ing to re­ports, about 11 se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tions – rep­re­sent­ing about one in 190,000 doses ad­min­is­tered – have been noted.</p>
    <p>This is still higher than the over­all rate of ana­phy­laxis in vac­ci­na­tions, at 1.3 per one mil­lion given, but that may be only be­cause we are be­ing much more care­ful about mon­i­tor­ing re­ac­tions at the mo­ment.</p>
    <p>Con­text also mat­ters. About one in 10 Amer­i­cans has re­ported an al­ler­gic re­ac­tion to peni­cillin. About one in 100, per­haps, has a true al­lergy to that class of drugs (I’m one of them). Be­tween one in 2,500 and one in 5,000 ex­pe­ri­ence ana­phy­laxis. But pae­di­a­tri­cians like me dis­pense peni­cillin all the time, with min­i­mal con­cerns.</p>
    <p>We do so be­cause most al­ler­gic re­ac­tions are mi­nor and se­ri­ous ones can be man­aged, and be­cause we be­lieve that the ben­e­fits out­weigh the harms.</p>
    <p>Every po­ten­tial bad out­come of a Covid-19 vac­cine should be weighed against the chance of get­ting sick or dy­ing from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Us­ing data from In­di­ana, which has con­ducted mul­ti­ple statewide stud­ies on the preva­lence of Covid-19, col­leagues from the In­di­ana Univer­sity – Pur­due Univer­sity In­di­anapo­lis Fair­banks School of Pub­lic Health and I cal­cu­lated the dis­ease’s in­fec­tion fa­tal­ity rate. We found that, for peo­ple 60 years and older who were not liv­ing in jails or nurs­ing homes, Covid-19 killed about one in 58 of those in­fected.</p>
    <p>For peo­ple be­tween the ages of 40 and 59, it was about one in 833, and for peo­ple younger than 40 it was about one in 10,000. For those who were not white, the fa­tal­ity rate was more than three times that for whites.</p>
    <p>While a vast ma­jor­ity of peo­ple who develop Covid-19 sur­vive, more than 670,000 Amer­i­cans have been hos­pi­talised with the dis­ease this year; sci­en­tists are still strug­gling to treat so-called long-haulers, who en­dure long-term ef­fects of the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A re­cent study in Jama In­ter­nal Medicine also showed that when the coro­n­avirus is more preva­lent in an area, out­comes worsen. Surges are oc­cur­ring all over now.</p>
    <p>Get­ting a vac­cine ap­pears to be or­ders of mag­ni­tude safer than get­ting in­fected with the virus.</p>
    <p>In or­der for the cri­sis to end, we need herd im­mu­nity. The only way to reach that is to get most peo­ple im­mu­nised or in­fected. Based on the num­bers above, the lat­ter would be a tragedy.</p>
    <p>Scar­ing peo­ple un­nec­es­sar­ily away from the former would re­sult in more in­fec­tions, more deaths and more eco­nomic and so­ci­etal hard­ship. We should def­i­nitely be trans­par­ent and plain about the risks and ben­e­fits of the vac­cines, but we need to put num­bers in con­text of the risks of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Vac­cines aren’t per­fect. In the com­ing weeks and months, we can ex­pect to read about peo­ple who were im­mu­nised and still fell sick. This won’t mean that the vac­cine is a fail­ure; it will sim­ply show, as we al­ready know, that the shots are not 100 per cent ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>Those of us who com­mu­ni­cate about pub­lic health have too of­ten failed to be clear dur­ing this pan­demic. Many peo­ple wound up be­ing con­fused about masks, tests and cer­tainly over how we should think about risk. This has not only led to con­fu­sion. It likely also led to sick­ness and death.</p>
    <p>Let’s do bet­ter with vac­cines. There’s a real chance we can stop this pan­demic this year if we get this right.</p>
