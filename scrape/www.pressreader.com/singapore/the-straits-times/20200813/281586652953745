    <p>Span­ish La Liga club Va­len­cia, owned by Sin­ga­porean bil­lion­aire Peter Lim, are brac­ing them­selves for a dif­fi­cult sea­son ow­ing to the pan­demic, which has cost the club mil­lions. With fans bay­ing for blood af­ter the man­ager was sacked and key play­ers sold, the club pres­i­dent has re­sponded to crit­ics, say­ing they have to be re­spon­si­ble and tighten the purse strings.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic will cost Span­ish La Liga club Va­len­cia mil­lions and lead to a “com­pli­cated” sea­son but de­spite lo­cal fans bay­ing for blood, their pres­i­dent Anil Murthy in­sists his man­age­ment team are up for the chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>The 47-year-old Sin­ga­porean, a for­mer diplo­mat, told The Straits Times: “We are brac­ing our­selves for a dif­fi­cult sea­son and Va­len­cia will not be the only club af­fected.”</p>
    <p>The wheels for sweep­ing change are al­ready in mo­tion on and off the pitch. In July, Javi Gra­cia took over the reins from for­mer man­ager Al­bert Ce­lades, who was sacked in June with Va­len­cia eighth in La Liga with six games to go. Los Che even­tu­ally fin­ished ninth un­der in­terim man­ager Sal­vador Gon­za­lez.</p>
    <p>Fail­ure to qual­ify for Euro­pean foot­ball is a fi­nan­cial set­back, as clubs can earn €15.25 mil­lion (S$24.7 mil­lion) and €3 mil­lion re­spec­tively in group-stage base fees in the Cham­pi­ons League and Europa League, with add-ons for wins, draws and progress to the lat­ter stages.</p>
    <p>Va­len­cia com­peted in the Cham­pi­ons League in the last two sea­sons and reached the 2019 Europa League semi-fi­nals. In a bid to re­duce their wage bill, they have sold winger Fer­ran Tor­res to Manch­ester City while mid­field­ers Francis Co­quelin and Dani Parejo de­parted yes­ter­day for a re­ported com­bined €11 mil­lion to Vil­lar­real.</p>
    <p>Va­len­cia also en­dured an “un­ac­cept­able” in­jury sit­u­a­tion last sea­son, with many key play­ers side­lined – star for­ward Goncalo Guedes was out for months with a mis­di­ag­nosed foot ail­ment – and only two made it through the term un­scathed. As a re­sult, about 15 of their back­room staff were told to leave and a new med­i­cal team has been re­cruited.</p>
    <p>Murthy said: “We hired new peo­ple and are build­ing a new team. This is very nor­mal in foot­ball.</p>
    <p>“We are pre­par­ing our­selves for the fu­ture with a strong and pro­fes­sional med­i­cal team so that we can fix the in­jury sit­u­a­tion and have our play­ers fight­ing fit on the pitch through­out the sea­son.</p>
    <p>“We are go­ing to have a com­pli­cated sea­son be­cause of Covid-19, so we must be re­spon­si­ble and con­trol costs tightly. What use is a bank­rupt club?</p>
    <p>“If things go very wrong in the fi­nan­cial as­pect due to Covid-19, all clubs will be in trou­ble. We have to lead through re­spon­si­ble man­age­ment dur­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, not all Va­len­cia fans are con­vinced.</p>
    <p>The Salvem Nostre Va­len­cia CF (Save Our Va­len­cia CF) group called for a demonstrat­ion out­side their home ground at the Mestalla yes­ter­day, with more than 500 peo­ple ex­pected to at­tend the protest.</p>
    <p>In mass e-mails to the Sin­ga­pore me­dia, Va­len­cia fans have also ac­cused Sin­ga­porean bil­lion­aire owner Peter Lim and Murthy of “neg­li­gently man­ag­ing the club”, “de­te­ri­o­rat­ing the value of the team” and “mis­treat­ing old leg­ends and club work­ers”.</p>
    <p>Lim’s daugh­ter, Kim, 29, stirred con­tro­versy last month in a sincedelet­ed In­sta­gram post.</p>
    <p>She wrote: “Some Va­len­cia fans are scold­ing and curs­ing at my fam­ily and I. Don’t they get it? The club is ours and we can do any­thing we want with it… no one can say any­thing.”</p>
    <p>The fans are also un­happy with the re­moval of for­mer man­ager Marcelino, who led the club to the King’s Cup, fourth place in La Liga and Cham­pi­ons League qual­i­fi­ca­tion last year, as well as the re­place­ment of team del­e­gate Paco Ca­ma­rasa, a for­mer cap­tain who has been at the club for four decades, with for­mer goal­keeper David Ran­gel.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it is un­der­stood that Marcelino had de­manded a lot of in­flu­ence in the club’s sign­ing pol­icy, put pub­lic pres­sure on the man­age­ment, and did not see eye to eye with their ideals of util­is­ing acad­emy play­ers.</p>
    <p>The sale of key play­ers Co­quelin and club cap­tain Parejo for a rel­a­tively small fee to one of Va­len­cia’s clos­est com­peti­tors has un­leashed a new wave of crit­i­cism from sup­port­ers and ex-play­ers against Lim, who bought the club in 2014.</p>
    <p>While vi­o­lent fan threats have been re­ported to the po­lice, Murthy re­it­er­ated what he had said in ear­lier in­ter­views: “As we have done many times, we al­ways seek to have direct com­mu­ni­ca­tion with fans. But ev­ery club will have their prob­lems and group of dis­sent­ing fans.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore Peter Lim took over, the club were un­sta­ble. We are in this for the long haul to grow Va­len­cia into a sta­ble and suc­cess­ful club.</p>
    <p>“We ac­cept we can make mis­takes, but we will al­ways work to­wards guid­ing the club to­wards be­ing back among the best again.”</p>
