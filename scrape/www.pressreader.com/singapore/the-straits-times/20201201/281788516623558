    <p>• China is mak­ing a new push to raise one of the world’s low­est re­tire­ment ages as it tries to cope with a rapidly age­ing pop­u­la­tion, a move that is al­ready fu­elling dis­con­tent and will test the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party’s abil­ity to im­ple­ment re­forms.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing party al­luded to the change last month when it re­leased an out­line of its five-year eco­nomic plan, which in­cluded a rec­om­men­da­tion to “im­ple­ment post­pon­ing the re­tire­ment age”. Spe­cific mea­sures in the plan are due to be un­veiled next March.</p>
    <p>China’s re­tire­ment age has re­mained un­changed for more than four decades at 60 for men and 55 for fe­male white-col­lar work­ers, even as life ex­pectancy has risen. In places like Ja­pan and Tai­wan, most men and women can re­tire and start draw­ing a pen­sion at 65.</p>
    <p>The party’s state­ment pro­duced a fierce back­lash do­mes­ti­cally, with tens of thou­sands of an­gry com­ments posted on Weibo, China’s equiv­a­lent of Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Top among the com­plaints were from those clos­est to re­tir­ing, ex­press­ing anger at the prospect of de­layed ac­cess to their pen­sions.</p>
    <p>Younger peo­ple ar­gued that an in­crease in the num­ber of older work­ers would re­duce their em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts say rais­ing the age at which work­ers are el­i­gi­ble for state-sup­ported pen­sions is cru­cial to en­sure the sus­tain­abil­ity of the re­tire­ment sys­tem. The Chi­nese Academy of So­cial Sci­ences, a gov­ern­ment think-tank, es­ti­mated in a re­port last year that the main pen­sion fund for ur­ban work­ers will peak at 7 tril­lion yuan (S$1.4 tril­lion) in 2027, be­fore fall­ing to zero by 2035. The bal­ance last year was 4.3 tril­lion yuan.</p>
    <p>Rais­ing the re­tire­ment age would also help China main­tain eco­nomic growth, by slow­ing the rate at which the work­ing-age pop­u­la­tion shrinks due to fall­ing birth rates. Bei­jing es­ti­mates the num­ber of peo­ple aged 60 or more will ap­proach 487 mil­lion by 2050, against 254 mil­lion last year.</p>
    <p>China ex­pe­ri­enced a baby boom in the early 1960s, re­sult­ing in more than 200 mil­lion peo­ple who will reach 60 in the next decade. As a re­sult, Chi­nese lead­ers will have no op­tion but to raise the pen­sion age dur­ing the next five-year plan that be­gins next year, said de­mog­ra­pher Wang Feng of the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, Irvine.</p>
    <p>“A mas­sive num­ber of peo­ple will reach this age dur­ing the next five years,” he said. “If they don’t act now, that would im­pose a tremen­dous fis­cal bur­den.”</p>
