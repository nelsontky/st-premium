    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans wel­comed the move to­wards the next phase of re­open­ing, while re­main­ing re­al­is­tic about the chances of mea­sures to curb the spread of Covid-19 – such as mask wear­ing and travel re­stric­tions – be­ing lifted any time soon.</p>
    <p>In a tele­vised na­tional ad­dress yesterday, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said phase three, to be­gin on Dec 28, would raise the per­mit­ted group size for so­cial gath­er­ings from five to eight, as well as ca­pac­ity lim­its in pub­lic places such as malls, at­trac­tions and places of wor­ship.</p>
    <p>Groups and work­places that op­er­ate in teams said this would mark a re­turn to some nor­mal­ity.</p>
    <p>Se­nior mar­ket­ing ex­ec­u­tive An­gele Chan, 25, an avid dancer, said that or­gan­is­ing dance re­hearsals dur­ing phase two has been chal­leng­ing, with lim­its on the num­ber of peo­ple in one ses­sion.</p>
    <p>“I am cau­tiously ex­cited – ex­cited to hang out in big­ger groups, but cau­tious be­cause we are mov­ing into the fes­tive sea­son and the chance of Covid-19 cases spik­ing is def­i­nitely there,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Vivien Lai, 58, who works as a su­per­vi­sor in an ini­tia­tive to help in­di­vid­u­als adopt dig­i­tal skills, said the lim­its in phase three will work well for her team.</p>
    <p>“Life in phase two has been very chal­leng­ing, espe­cially when it comes to or­gan­is­ing team lunches and din­ners. We have to split into two groups.</p>
    <p>“Phase three, al­low­ing us to meet in groups of eight, is wel­come news for my team as we have eight in a team. Come next year, we can have team ac­tiv­i­ties out­side the of­fice and look for­ward to trav­el­ling at the end of the year,” she added.</p>
    <p>Fi­nance in­dus­try ex­ec­u­tive Sarthak Shreya, 27, wel­comed the fur­ther eas­ing, but said peo­ple should con­tinue ob­serv­ing safety mea­sures dur­ing the fes­tive pe­riod to pre­vent a pos­si­ble spike in cases.</p>
    <p>“Mov­ing into the next phase is a wel­come move, but I am wor­ried that peo­ple may con­gre­gate dur­ing events like on New Year’s Eve. I hope ev­ery­one takes the Gov­ern­ment’s ad­vice about wear­ing masks and so­cial dis­tanc­ing se­ri­ously. For my­self, I plan to stay in on New Year’s Eve, and will re­strict my visits to just fam­ily mem­bers,” he said.</p>
    <p>Singapore Chi­nese Chamber of Commerce and In­dus­try (SCCCI) pres­i­dent Roland Ng said the SCCCI sup­ports the Gov­ern­ment’s de­ci­sion to move into phase three.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment to The Straits Times, Mr Ng said: “Cur­rently, many coun­tries and re­gions are ac­tively tak­ing mea­sures to deal with the re­cur­ring waves of in­fec­tions and de­vel­op­ing vac­ci­na­tion plans.</p>
    <p>“Singapore is an open econ­omy, and the top pri­or­i­ties of the Gov­ern­ment when deal­ing with the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion will be on three ma­jor as­pects: the global sit­u­a­tion, eco­nomic re­cov­ery and pub­lic healthcare.</p>
    <p>“Com­pa­nies should con­tinue to adapt to the chang­ing en­vi­ron­ment, em­pha­sise their ef­fort in three main ar­eas: en­hanc­ing en­ter­prise ca­pa­bil­ity, strength­en­ing col­lab­o­ra­tion in over­seas mar­kets, and lever­ag­ing new op­por­tu­ni­ties of Singapore-China co­op­er­a­tion, in or­der to seize busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties as the coun­try grad­u­ally moves to­wards re­open­ing.”</p>
