    <p>RIYADH • Saudi Ara­bia will host the Group of 20 (G-20) sum­mit on Satur­day in a first for an Arab na­tion, but the scaled-down vir­tual for­mat could limit de­bate on a resur­gent coro­n­avirus pan­demic and crip­pling eco­nomic cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The two-day meet­ing of the world’s wealth­i­est na­tions fol­lows a bit­ter United States elec­tion dis­puted by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and comes amid crit­i­cism over what cam­paign­ers call the group’s in­ad­e­quate re­sponse to the worst re­ces­sion in decades.</p>
    <p>Held un­der the shadow of a rag­ing pan­demic, the sum­mit, which is usu­ally an op­por­tu­nity for one-onone en­gage­ments be­tween world lead­ers, has been re­duced to brief on­line ses­sions on press­ing global is­sues – from cli­mate change to grow­ing in­equal­ity.</p>
    <p>Dis­cus­sions are ex­pected to be dom­i­nated by the “im­pli­ca­tions of the pan­demic” and “steps for re­viv­ing the global econ­omy”, sources close to the Saudi or­gan­is­ers said.</p>
    <p>New vac­cine break­throughs have raised hopes of con­tain­ing the virus, which has in­fected 55 mil­lion peo­ple glob­ally and left 1.3 mil­lion dead.</p>
    <p>The Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co-oper­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment projects that global eco­nomic out­put will con­tract by 4.5 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>G-20 na­tions have con­trib­uted more than US$21 bil­lion (S$28 bil­lion) to com­bat the pan­demic – in­clud­ing pro­duc­tion and dis­tri­bu­tion of vac­cines – and in­jected US$11 tril­lion to safe­guard the virus-bat­tered world econ­omy, or­gan­is­ers said. But the group faces mount­ing pres­sure to help stave off pos­si­ble credit de­faults across de­vel­op­ing na­tions.</p>
    <p>Last week, G-20 fi­nance min­is­ters de­clared a “com­mon frame­work” for an ex­tended debt re­struc­tur­ing plan for virus-rav­aged coun­tries, but cam­paign group Ac­tionAid de­scribed the mea­sure as “woe­fully in­ad­e­quate”.</p>
    <p>Mistrust be­tween mem­ber states has ham­pered co­or­di­na­tion, with a US Trea­sury of­fi­cial ac­cus­ing China – a top cred­i­tor to poor coun­tries – of a “lack of full par­tic­i­pa­tion” and trans­parency.</p>
    <p>“We are fac­ing the world’s largest hu­man­i­tar­ian cri­sis and women in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries are bear­ing the worst im­pacts of the health and eco­nomic fall­out,” said Ac­tionAid’s Kather­ine Tu. “Yet the G-20 has its head in the sand and is fail­ing to re­spond to the ur­gency of the sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Saudi Ara­bia’s King Sal­man bin Ab­du­laziz Al Saud will pre­side over what some ob­servers call “dig­i­tal diplo­macy”. Canada-based G-20 Re­search Group di­rec­tor John Kir­ton said the vir­tual set­ting could frus­trate “spon­ta­neous com­bus­tion” among lead­ers, lim­it­ing “en­coun­ters on un­sched­uled sub­jects”.</p>
    <p>World lead­ers, in­clud­ing Ger­many’s An­gela Merkel, China’s Xi Jin­ping and Rus­sia’s Vladimir Putin, are ex­pected to make speeches, the sources said. US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo will be present in Saudi Ara­bia dur­ing the sum­mit. It is un­clear whether Mr Trump will speak at the event.</p>
    <p>Mr Ryan Bohl, from US geopo­lit­i­cal think-tank Strat­for, said: “Trump’s ac­tions at the sum­mit aren’t likely to have as much of an ef­fect as they might have in pre­vi­ous years.”</p>
    <p>The sum­mit was sup­posed to be a com­ing-out party for Saudi Ara­bia on the world stage. It had planned a grand event show­cas­ing the am­bi­tious mod­erni­sa­tion drive of de facto ruler Crown Prince Mo­hammed bin Sal­man, whose in­ter­na­tional rep­u­ta­tion was tar­nished by the 2018 mur­der of jour­nal­ist Ja­mal Khashoggi by a team of Saudis al­legedly di­rected by the Crown Prince’s right-hand men.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the coun­try’s hu­man rights record has over­shad­owed the event, with cam­paign­ers urg­ing lead­ers to boy­cott the sum­mit – or press for an­swers.</p>
