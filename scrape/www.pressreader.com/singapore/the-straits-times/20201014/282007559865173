    <p>Even be­fore the coro­n­avirus pan­demic made home­work­ing com­mon­place, Au­tomat­tic’s 1,277-strong work­force was en­tirely re­mote, with perks that in­clude re­im­burs­ing ex­penses to set up work­ers’ home offices.</p>
    <p>Yet de­spite its re­mote ethos, the group, which owns and op­er­ates Web de­sign com­pany Word­Press, does not ex­pect its em­ploy­ees to work in iso­la­tion ev­ery day. It of­fers a monthly stipend to be used to­wards co-work­ing spa­ces (day passes or on­go­ing mem­ber­ship) or cof­fee shops (WiFi costs, cof­fees).</p>
    <p>The so­cial high­light of the year is the GM, or Grand Meet-up, where staff from 76 coun­tries, speak­ing 95 lan­guages, get to­gether for a week of key­note ses­sions, work­shops, team ses­sions and so­cial­is­ing fo­cused on strat­egy, learn­ing and team bond­ing. Em­ploy­ees are en­cour­aged to eat with dif­fer­ent col­leagues ev­ery night to meet peo­ple out­side their teams.</p>
    <p>“It’s still im­por­tant to meet face-to-face – just not ev­ery day, in the same of­fice,” says Ms Me­gan Mar­cel, head of global events. The GM is a chance “to get to know the peo­ple be­hind the Slack avatars and build re­la­tion­ships that can carry us through the other 51 weeks of the year”. Covid-19 can­celled this year’s gath­er­ing, but the com­pany did hold some vir­tual ses­sions. None­the­less, it could not match the GM, which the com­pany will re­in­state when trav­el­ling is safe.</p>
    <p>Au­tomat­tic’s ideas about so­cial in­ter­ac­tion for dis­trib­uted work­forces show one pos­si­ble blueprint for work in the post-pan­demic world. Overnight, lock­downs demon­strated that large groups of work­ers could do their jobs from home. The ex­pe­ri­ence has made com­pa­nies re­think work­ing pat­terns – yet few are pre­pared, for now, to recre­ate Au­tomat­tic’s re­mote model.</p>
    <p>Rather, in a bid to re­duce their of­fice space and ac­com­mo­date em­ploy­ees’ de­sire for flex­i­bil­ity, they are mix­ing re­mote and of­fice work – or hy­brid work­ing.</p>
    <p>DIF­FI­CUL­TIES WITH NEW MOD­ELS</p>
    <p>But a hy­brid model brings chal­lenges. Work­ers cur­rently split be­tween home and of­fice are al­ready find­ing it can be hard to man­age and it re­in­forces di­vi­sions be­tween the in-crowd and at-home crowd. “It’s eas­ier to have a team of 20 all be­ing re­mote rather than 15 peo­ple in a room and five re­mote. With ev­ery­one on an equal foot­ing it’s rel­a­tively easy,” says Mr Jes­per Fred­erik­sen, UK vice-pres­i­dent of Okta, a soft­ware group.</p>
    <p>Mr Job van der Voort, co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of Re­mote.com, which pro­vides pay­roll and in­cen­tives to dis­trib­uted work­forces, says the hy­brid model is the hard­est one to achieve and can lead to a two-tier work­force. “The thresh­old for ask­ing a col­league some­thing when walk­ing by – and not ever doc­u­ment­ing it (or) shar­ing it in a way that be­comes ac­ces­si­ble to those work­ing re­motely is very low,” he says.</p>
    <p>More­over, it is easy to grab a drink with a col­league when work­ing to­gether in an of­fice.</p>
    <p>Some mea­sures to over­come this might in­clude send­ing agen­das in ad­vance of meet­ings and invit­ing writ­ten con­tri­bu­tions as well as invit­ing ev­ery­one to speak.</p>
    <p>Not ev­ery­one wants to work at home, how­ever.</p>
    <p>B+H Architects’ CEO Bill Nankiv­ell says its Chi­nese di­vi­sion has been re­sis­tant to new work­ing pat­terns, so as an ex­per­i­ment to change the cul­ture, the Shang­hai of­fice made it manda­tory to work from home one day a week. “Ninety per cent saw some el­e­ment as a ben­e­fit. On the other hand, we also learnt that not ev­ery­one was com­fort­able work­ing from home. Liv­ing ar­range­ments in ma­jor Chi­nese cities can be cramped.”</p>
    <p>WHEN TO PLAN</p>
    <p>It may be un­wise to com­mit to per­ma­nent plans about work pat­terns on cur­rent cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, notes Ms Mon­ica Parker, founder of an­a­lyt­ics firm Hatch, many coun­tries are still in “a triage phase”, adding: “This isn’t gen­uine re­mote work­ing in that it has re­moved au­ton­omy of choos­ing when to work from home ver­sus when to work from the of­fice – au­ton­omy be­ing a key suc­cess fac­tor to re­mote work­ing.”</p>
    <p>Man­agers should take ad­van­tage where pos­si­ble to ex­per­i­ment with new work ar­range­ments and as­sess the im­pact on em­ployee at­ti­tudes and per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>Dr Eric Ani­cich, as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor of man­age­ment and or­gan­i­sa­tion at the Univer­sity of South­ern Cal­i­for­nia Mar­shall School of Busi­ness, says: “With­out data, man­agers may make in­ac­cu­rate as­sump­tions about em­ployee pref­er­ences and broader pol­icy im­pact. The goal for or­gan­i­sa­tional lead­ers should be to de­ter­mine, but not nec­es­sar­ily be in a rush to im­ple­ment, the most vi­able and ef­fec­tive long-term work ar­range­ment.” He ad­vises test­ing hy­brid poli­cies one depart­ment at a time and re­vis­ing them.</p>
    <p>RE­THINK­ING TASKS</p>
    <p>Hy­brid work mod­els re­quire clar­ity about job roles to de­cide which tasks are best suited to home (writ­ing a re­port) or the of­fice (brain­storm­ing).</p>
    <p>It is an op­por­tu­nity for re­think­ing some of these tasks, Prof Ani­cich says. He takes the ex­am­ple of a team cre­at­ing a new ad­ver­tis­ing cam­paign. Rather than get a work­ing party to­gether at the start of the pro­ject, em­ploy­ees could gen­er­ate ideas re­motely and share them anony­mously, re­duc­ing the pres­sure to con­form to group­think. The team could meet phys­i­cally later to eval­u­ate the pool of ideas.</p>
    <p>It also re­quires greater plan­ning. Mr David D’Souza, mem­ber­ship direc­tor at the Char­tered In­sti­tute of Per­son­nel and Devel­op­ment, says ad­min­is­tra­tive staff are of­ten the first to be cut in a down­turn, yet the chang­ing rules on so­cial dis­tanc­ing and work­places, as well as fu­ture hy­brid mod­els, de­mand a great deal of co­or­di­na­tion be­tween work­place fa­cil­i­ties man­age­ment and human re­sources.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, a sparsely pop­u­lated of­fice might re­in­force iso­la­tion, cut serendip­i­tous con­ver­sa­tions and risk silo­ing teams. Ms Kristi Hum­mel, se­nior vice-part­ner of tal­ent and cul­ture at Dell Tech­nolo­gies, says the firm has “amped up its man­age­ment train­ing” to sup­port flex­i­ble work.</p>
    <p>Hy­brid work­ing could trans­form per­for­mance re­views, says Mr Steve Collinson, UK head of HR for in­sur­ance group Zurich. “If teams are largely work­ing from home, a very sim­ple way of get­ting peo­ple to­gether is to spread per­for­mance dis­cus­sions (to monthly in­stead of quar­terly) to talk about goals.”</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy is evolv­ing to sup­port new work­ing meth­ods. Ms Ni­cole Her­skowitz, gen­eral man­ager for Mi­crosoft Teams, says the com­pany has re­cently up­dated its video-con­fer­enc­ing to in­clude speaker at­tri­bu­tion to help hy­brid work­ing. “If there are five peo­ple in the meet­ing room and five peo­ple at home, I might strug­gle if at home” to know who is talk­ing.</p>
    <p>One of the chal­lenges in a hy­brid model is so­cial­is­ing, an as­pect of cor­po­rate life that home­work­ers say they miss. Ms Priya Parker, au­thor of The Art Of Gath­er­ing, says firms are ask­ing: “What can we do apart, and what can we do to­gether. (Per­haps) we do our work vir­tu­ally but do our play to­gether?”</p>
    <p>Ms Liz Burow, work­place strat­egy and de­sign re­searcher, for­merly at WeWork, says the dan­ger with fo­cus­ing on so­cial­is­ing is that it can be­come stilted rather than serendip­i­tous or con­versely make gath­er­ings re­volve around happy hours, cre­at­ing a “bro cul­ture”, adding:</p>
    <p>“If you are shy and in­tro­verted it might be very stress­ful.”</p>
    <p>She sug­gests forg­ing con­nec­tions through re­lated projects, such as hackathons, which could be held re­motely or in-per­son.</p>
    <p>HUB AND SPOKE</p>
    <p>One model that might suit hy­brid work is the hub and spoke, whereby a com­pany has a main of­fice and satel­lite ones, al­low­ing work­ers to meet up closer to home.</p>
    <p>Dr Peter Bace­vice, direc­tor of re­search at HLW, a global ar­chi­tec­ture and de­sign firm, says “neigh­bour­hood hubs” where clus­ters of em­ploy­ees live would re­duce com­mut­ing time and “as­sim­i­late a cross-sec­tion of work­ers from var­i­ous roles, giv­ing them a chance to build com­mu­nity based on the com­mon ex­pe­ri­ence of where they live. This would be a great way to break tra­di­tional role-based si­los”.</p>
    <p>Another ben­e­fit might be to pop­u­late un­used spa­ces, such as va­cant store­fronts, “bring­ing new life and new uses to neigh­bour­hoods and street life”.</p>
