    <p>The Philip­pines is see­ing the start of a surge in coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, as cases in about a dozen cities in the cap­i­tal re­gion rise, health of­fi­cials warned yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“There has been a con­tin­u­ous growth of cases in Metro Manila, sig­nalling the start of a surge… It is not a ques­tion any­more of if a surge will hap­pen, but when and by how much,” Health Un­der­sec­re­tary Rosario Vergeire said.</p>
    <p>She noted that peo­ple are in­creas­ingly gath­er­ing in large crowds and flout­ing safety pro­to­cols in the run-up to the Christ­mas hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>Data ex­perts es­ti­mate that virus cases could spike, up to 4,000 a day, from a cur­rent av­er­age of fewer than 1,500, by end-Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>“That’s on the higher end, if things get re­ally bad,” said Dr Guido David, head of the Octa Re­search Group based at the staterun Univer­sity of the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>He said that with 4,000 cases a day, the health sys­tem will be over­whelmed, ne­ces­si­tat­ing a re­turn to a sweep­ing lock­down.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines went through one of the long­est and strictest lock­downs in the world early this year, shut­ting down nearly all busi­nesses and keep­ing mil­lions of peo­ple stuck inside their homes.</p>
    <p>With in­fec­tions re­treat­ing to be­low 1,500 a day and a death rate of less than 2 per cent in re­cent months, the gov­ern­ment has been mov­ing to re­vive a crip­pled econ­omy, put peo­ple back to work and get them to spend once more.</p>
    <p>Tens of thou­sands of fac­tory work­ers are back at eco­nomic zones in the sub­urbs that ring Met­ro­pol­i­tan Manila.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple are flock­ing back to restau­rants, mar­kets, gyms and churches. Malls are see­ing a no­tice­able jump in foot traf­fic. Pub­lic trans­port is back up to 50 per cent.</p>
    <p>But all this has led to an uptick in cases in the past two weeks, es­pe­cially in Metro Manila, as peo­ple let their guard down, meet­ing in groups with­out masks.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines has the sec­ond­high­est num­ber of Covid-19 cases in South-east Asia, af­ter In­done­sia, with over 452,000. Nearly half of the cases are in Metro Manila, home to some 13 mil­lion, with cities such as Que­zon City, Caloocan, Taguig and Makati mak­ing up a large share.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment and health ad­vo­cates are now telling the pub­lic to ease back on the so­cial­is­ing.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte urged the pub­lic dur­ing a Cab­i­net meet­ing on Wed­nes­day not to hold Christ­mas par­ties and large gath­er­ings. “Make it a sac­ri­fice… We have suf­fered enough, and to suf­fer more is not ac­cept­able. Please con­tinue to obey pro­to­cols,” he said.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion in the Philip­pines is not unique in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) said yes­ter­day that Covid-19 in­fec­tions have lately been more preva­lent among young adults who, in a sign of quar­an­tine fa­tigue, have been re­turn­ing to nor­mal rou­tines, ig­nor­ing mask man­dates and so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, the coro­n­avirus had hit the el­derly more, said Dr Takeshi Ka­sai, WHO’s di­rec­tor for the West­ern Pa­cific. He told those be­low 40 years old: “I know how tired you are of this pan­demic, and I un­der­stand the anx­i­ety, fears and un­cer­tain­ties you’re feel­ing. Some of you may not even feel par­tic­u­larly vul­ner­a­ble to this disease. You might think even if you get in­fected, you won’t get very sick. But the truth is, you can.”</p>
    <p>Dr Ka­sai added that a vac­cine “is not a sil­ver bul­let”, and the fact that na­tions have started giv­ing mil­lions of shots should not in­duce com­pla­cency.</p>
    <p>“No one na­tion is safe un­til ev­ery­one is pro­tected,” he said, and that could take years.</p>
