    <p>BRUS­SELS • Euro­pean Union lead­ers meet­ing in Brus­sels for a sec­ond day were clos­ing in on a deal for a €750 bil­lion (S$1.2 tril­lion) stim­u­lus pack­age yes­ter­day, af­ter the Dutch gov­ern­ment in­di­cated sup­port for the di­rec­tion of the ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
    <p>A new pro­posal – which would keep the over­all size of the fund the same but re­duce the amount dis­trib­uted as grants by €50 bil­lion – is a ma­jor step in the right di­rec­tion, ac­cord­ing to a Dutch of­fi­cial fa­mil­iar with the talks, who asked not to be iden­ti­fied be­cause the process is pri­vate. The new plan would see €450 bil­lion dis­bursed as grants.</p>
    <p>The new push comes af­ter the first day of ne­go­ti­a­tions ended in ac­ri­mony, leav­ing the bloc’s plan to help its economies heal from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic hang­ing in the bal­ance.</p>
    <p>At stake is not just the amount of funds to be given to coun­tries, but also the abil­ity of the EU to of­fer mean­ing­ful sol­i­dar­ity to its 27 mem­bers and push through un­prece­dented fi­nan­cial in­te­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>Europe is in the depths of its deep­est re­ces­sion since World War II.</p>
    <p>Most lead­ers are seek­ing a de­ci­sive re­sponse from the bloc with more than 100,000 Euro­peans dead from Covid-19 and their economies bat­tered by lock­downs.</p>
    <p>Yet sit­ting to­gether in Brus­sels for the first time in five months, they spent much of the first day bick­er­ing over a Dutch re­quest for a mech­a­nism to al­low mem­ber states to hold up the dis­bur­sal of funds.</p>
    <p>In a nod to Dutch de­mands, the new plan would in­clude a “su­per emer­gency brake” that would al­low a sin­gle mem­ber state to hold up a dis­burse­ment if it had ques­tions about whether the funds would be used ap­pro­pri­ately.</p>
    <p>Govern­ments would have three days from when the com­mis­sion ap­proves a pay­ment to raise their ob­jec­tions and then the mat­ter would have to be ad­dressed by ei­ther EU lead­ers or finance min­is­ters.</p>
    <p>Within the EU bloc has been stern re­sis­tance from a group of small rich na­tions led by the Nether­lands and Aus­tria that are loath to hand out cash to coun­tries such as Spain or Italy which they see as too lax with pub­lic spend­ing.</p>
    <p>The Dutch have emerged as the most re­sis­tant among mem­bers of the so-called “Fru­gal Four” which also com­prise Swe­den, Den­mark and Aus­tria.</p>
    <p>The fru­gals want any loans or grants to come with strict con­di­tions at­tached to en­sure that heav­ily in­debted coun­tries carry out labour mar­ket re­form. This is fu­ri­ously op­posed by the south­ern na­tions like Italy and Spain.</p>
    <p>“If the money is not used to in­vest in the fu­ture, if it does not go hand in hand with nec­es­sary re­forms in states that are sim­ply bro­ken in their sys­tems... then all this will fiz­zle out,” Aus­trian Chan­cel­lor Se­bas­tian Kurz had warned on the first day of the ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Else­where in the world, G-20 finance min­is­ters and cen­tral bankers were yes­ter­day set to com­mence talks, hosted by Saudi Ara­bia, aimed at spurring eco­nomic re­cov­ery from the global re­ces­sion amid grow­ing calls to widen debt re­lief for cri­sis-hit poor coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“We are not out of the woods yet,” the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Kristalina Ge­orgieva said in a mes­sage to G-20 finance min­is­ters, warn­ing that the coro­n­avirus pan­demic is set to in­crease poverty and in­equal­ity.</p>
    <p>Down­grad­ing its growth fore­casts, the Washington-based cri­sis lender last month said it ex­pected global GDP to fall by 4.9 per cent this year due to a deeper con­trac­tion dur­ing lock­downs than pre­vi­ously an­tic­i­pated.</p>
    <p>The US$11 tril­lion (S$15 tril­lion) in stim­u­lus of­fered by G-20 na­tions has helped to pre­vent a worse out­come, but “these safety nets must be main­tained as needed and, in some cases, ex­panded,” Ms Ge­orgieva said.</p>
