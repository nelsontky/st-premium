    <p>• The 1MDB trial of for­mer Malaysian prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak re­sumed yes­ter­day af­ter be­ing post­poned for nearly four months, with the pros­e­cu­tion rais­ing a flag over a so­cial media “at­tack” by Na­jib on a for­mer Bank Ne­gara gov­er­nor.</p>
    <p>The lead prose­cu­tor, Datuk Seri Gopal Sri Ram, raised the is­sue in the High Court, say­ing the de­fen­dant must be given a stern warn­ing by the court as for­mer gov­er­nor Zeti Akhtar Aziz is to ap­pear as a wit­ness in the trial.</p>
    <p>Na­jib, 67, faces 25 charges for abuse of power and money laun­der­ing over al­leged funds of 1Malaysia Devel­op­ment Ber­had to­talling RM2.28 billion (S$750 mil­lion) that was de­posited into his Am­Bank ac­counts be­tween Fe­bru­ary 2011 and De­cem­ber 2014.</p>
    <p>In his Face­book post on Dec 29, Na­jib asked Tan Sri Zeti to re­spond to al­le­ga­tions that her family re­ceived more than RM100 mil­lion said to be from 1MDB funds, from fugi­tive busi­ness­man Low Taek Jho.</p>
    <p>Ms Zeti re­sponded in a state­ment on Dec 31: “I wish to re­it­er­ate that my family and I have never re­ceived any sums of money from 1MDB. The al­le­ga­tions against me and my family are com­pletely false and ma­li­cious.”</p>
    <p>Mr Sri Ram told pre­sid­ing judge, Jus­tice Collin Lawrence Se­querah, yes­ter­day that Na­jib de­lib­er­ately at­tacked the for­mer gov­er­nor. He pointed out that the ac­cused knew Ms Zeti would be called to tes­tify as a wit­ness list was made avail­able to the de­fence last year. “I don’t want to move an ap­pli­ca­tion to take his bail or con­tempt, but I will be grate­ful if the court would im­pose a strict warn­ing against the ac­cused to not do this again.</p>
    <p>“A trial has to take place in a court of law, not in the pub­lic do­main, and cer­tainly not on so­cial media. We want as­sur­ance that our wit­ness will not be at­tacked,” Mr Sri Ram said.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing, Na­jib’s lead coun­sel Muham­mad Shafee Ab­dul­lah said dis­al­low­ing Na­jib to share his thoughts on so­cial media was akin to “a boxer be­ing sent to the ring with both hands tied, can take punches but not be able to re­ply back”.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Shafee said the de­fence had tried to ap­ply for a gag or­der to stop the media and any per­son from dis­cussing the mer­its of the SRC In­ter­na­tional trial, but this was dis­missed. “But ev­ery­one else can say any­thing about him (Na­jib). They call him a crook, a per­ompak (thief), and no ac­tion was taken. The lawyer then told the court that the de­fence would do a sub­mis­sion on the mat­ter on Thurs­day and asked the court to re­serve the mat­ter for later.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Se­querah agreed to re­serve the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The 1MDB trial has been post­poned sev­eral times ow­ing to move­ment curbs caused by the Covid-19 pan­demic. The trial is sep­a­rate from the one over SRC In­ter­na­tional, a for­mer unit of 1MDB. Na­jib was in July last year found guilty of cor­rup­tion in the case in­volv­ing RM42 mil­lion that was de­posited into his per­sonal bank ac­counts, with the funds be­long­ing to SRC In­ter­na­tional. He was sen­tenced to 12 years’ jail and given a fine of RM210 mil­lion. He is ap­peal­ing against the ver­dict.</p>
