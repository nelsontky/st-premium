    <p>As the re­la­tion­ship be­tween Sin­ga­pore and China evolves, the two coun­tries are work­ing to­gether on new ar­eas such as pub­lic health and com­ing up with ways to deepen con­nec­tiv­ity, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat (right) said yes­ter­day after the 16th Joint Coun­cil for Bi­lat­eral Co­op­er­a­tion be­tween Sin­ga­pore and China.</p>
    <p>As the re­la­tion­ship be­tween Sin­ga­pore and China evolves, the two coun­tries are work­ing to­gether in new ar­eas such as pub­lic health and com­ing up with ways to deepen con­nec­tiv­ity, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The ground­work is be­ing laid now, even as strate­gies are be­ing drawn up to­wards achiev­ing a more pros­per­ous fu­ture to­gether, he told the press after the 16th Joint Coun­cil for Bi­lat­eral Co­op­er­a­tion (JCBC) be­tween Sin­ga­pore and China.</p>
    <p>The JCBC is the high­est-level bi­lat­eral plat­form be­tween both coun­tries. It is jointly chaired by Mr Heng, who is also Fi­nance Min­is­ter and Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies, and Chi­nese Vice-Premier Han Zheng.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng iden­ti­fied con­nec­tiv­ity, dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and sus­tain­able devel­op­ment as crit­i­cal ar­eas in which the coun­tries must col­lab­o­rate in a post-Covid-19 world.</p>
    <p>“With our two coun­tries hav­ing suc­cess­fully con­tained our out­breaks, en­hanc­ing con­nec­tiv­ity will po­si­tion our coun­tries well for a new nor­mal, that is more dig­i­tal and with greater em­pha­sis on sus­tain­abil­ity,” said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>Ten mem­o­ran­dums of un­der­stand­ing (MOUs) and agree­ments on health, food safety and the en­vi­ron­ment, among other things, were signed yes­ter­day at the apex meet­ing held vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>Lead­ers also re­viewed bi­lat­eral co­op­er­a­tion un­der the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive, eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion, trade and in­no­va­tion, fi­nan­cial co­op­er­a­tion, pub­lic health co­op­er­a­tion, peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­changes, and sus­tain­able devel­op­ment, ac­cord­ing to a state­ment from the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said: “The sub­stan­tive agenda this year re­flects the breadth and depth of our co­op­er­a­tion. This builds on a strong foun­da­tion es­tab­lished by lead­ers on both sides, and suc­ces­sive gen­er­a­tions of JCBC co-chairs.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the meet­ing, the two lead­ers dis­cussed how Sin­ga­pore can con­tinue to con­trib­ute to China’s devel­op­ment strate­gies in the re­gion for their bi­lat­eral pro­jects, such as the Sin­ga­pore-China Shen­zhen Smart City Ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said: “Dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion has be­come more im­por­tant... and go­ing dig­i­tal can help to raise qual­ity of life in the city.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion Min­istry and the Shen­zhen Mu­nic­i­pal Peo­ple’s Gov­ern­ment signed an MOU on the Sin­ga­pore-China (Shen­zhen) Smart City Ini­tia­tive at the JCBC meet­ing in Chongqing last year.</p>
    <p>Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion Min­is­ter S. Iswaran said at the brief­ing that sig­nif­i­cant progress on the ini­tia­tive has been made since the MOU was signed in ar­eas such as dig­i­tal trade, cross-bor­der data man­age­ment and in­no­va­tion and en­trepreneur­ship.</p>
    <p>On Covid-19 travel mea­sures, Mr Heng said Sin­ga­pore and China will be dis­cussing how to bet­ter utilise the ex­ist­ing fast lanes, in­crease flight fre­quency and re­store nor­mal peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­changes at an ap­pro­pri­ate time.</p>
    <p>“This will con­trib­ute to the re­cov­ery of our economies and our peo­ple’s liveli­hoods,” he added.</p>
    <p>On pub­lic health col­lab­o­ra­tion, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said at the brief­ing that it is im­por­tant that both coun­tries work closely to­gether to en­hance co­op­er­a­tion in pub­lic health man­age­ment so they can pro­tect peo­ple’s health.</p>
    <p>“Since the start of the pan­demic, both coun­tries have sup­ported each other and dis­cussed strate­gies of Covid-19 preven­tion and con­trol, and how to safely re­sume so­cial and eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties,” he added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is cur­rently tri­alling dig­i­tal doc­u­men­ta­tion with two ports in China – Qinzhou and Tian­jin – to fa­cil­i­tate trade by re­duc­ing the amount of pa­per­work in­volved in cross-bor­der trade, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The tri­als come as part of Sin­ga­pore’s move to build its Net­worked Trade Plat­form, which will al­low for elec­tronic ex­changes of doc­u­ments needed for im­port and ex­port, Mr Heng added at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence after the 16th Joint Coun­cil for Bi­lat­eral Co­op­er­a­tion be­tween Sin­ga­pore and China.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore launched the Net­worked Trade Plat­form ini­tia­tive in 2018 to cut back on the pa­per­work in­volved in cross-bor­der trade and re­duce the time needed for im­port and ex­port of goods, among other ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said if the tri­als are suc­cess­ful, elec­tronic ex­changes would help the pri­vate sec­tor “deal with trade fi­nance, trade in­sur­ance in a much more dig­i­tal way”.</p>
    <p>Un­der a new mem­o­ran­dum of un­der­stand­ing on China-Sin­ga­pore (Tian­jin) Cus­toms Twin­ning Co­op­er­a­tion, the Repub­lic and Tian­jin i n north­ern China will share best prac­tices on the ap­pli­ca­tion of new tech­nolo­gies and im­prove risk man­age­ment by ex­chang­ing per­mit data.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive will deepen con­nec­tiv­ity be­tween Sin­ga­pore and China.</p>
    <p>Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said Sin­ga­pore can part­ner China to cre­ate more in­clu­sive, in­ter­na­tional plat­forms that can bet­ter con­nect with the world, and work to­wards es­tab­lish­ing global stan­dards for a more in­clu­sive and i nte­grated global or­der.</p>
    <p>Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion Min­is­ter S. Iswaran said that on the dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion front, Sin­ga­pore is work­ing on a pi­lot project with Shen­zhen to mu­tu­ally recog­nise elec­tronic bills of lad­ing.</p>
    <p>A bill of lad­ing is a le­gal and com­mer­cial doc­u­ment pro­vid­ing ev­i­dence for the con­tract of car­riage, re­ceipt, own­er­ship and a record of goods for a cargo ship­ment.</p>
    <p>Given the in­tri­ca­cies of mar­itime trade law, the pa­per trail typ­i­cally runs up to hun­dreds of pages for a sin­gle trans­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Iswaran said the aim is to roll out the pi­lot by the first quar­ter of next year. “Po­ten­tially, we can then broaden that to be­tween China and Sin­ga­pore and through Sin­ga­pore into the re­gion. It will be a sig­nif­i­cant achieve­ment,” he added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has also ex­panded its Global In­no­va­tion Al­liance to in­clude Shen­zhen, he said. The al­liance, now with 15 global cities, is an ini­tia­tive to strengthen the coun­try’s con­nec­tions to ma­jor in­no­va­tion hubs around the world.</p>
    <p>This links Sin­ga­pore’s in­no­va­tion en­ter­prise sys­tem to Shen­zhen’s, so that com­pa­nies can work to­gether and tap tal­ent and ideas be­ing de­vel­oped on both sides, the min­is­ter added.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu said Sin­ga­pore and China will, over the next two years, co­op­er­ate in re­gional and in­ter­na­tional plat­forms, such as the United Na­tions Frame­work Con­ven­tion on Cli­mate Change, and in Asean-China re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>“Both sides will also en­hance co­op­er­a­tion on cir­cu­lar econ­omy and zero-waste ini­tia­tives at the Sino-Sin­ga­pore Tian­jin Eco-City, and ex­change best prac­tices in car­bon pric­ing and devel­op­ment of mon­i­tor­ing, re­port­ing and ver­i­fi­ca­tion re­quire­ments,” she added.</p>
