        10 | SATURDAY, JULY 18, 2020 SCHOLARS’ CHOICE: SECURE YOUR FUTURE NOW Fulfilling­g her childhood dr eam A firsthand look at how nurses who cared for her grandmothe­r helped Ms Goh Pei Qi discover her calling                      W grade our clinical skills and knowledge,” said Ms Goh, stressing that it is important to improve interperso­nal skills, research abilities and management capabiliti­es to meet the needs of the future.
The elderly are foremost on her mind. “As my interest in healthcare stemmed from caring for my grandmothe­r, I knew as an OT student that I wanted to serve the geriatric population and the elderly.”
The experience gained from several clinical attachment­s and seeing how a nurse made her grandmothe­r so comfortabl­e during the last few months of her life piqued her interest in palliative care.
“My grandmothe­r died when I was still an OT student. Thinking of how I might have better used my OT skills when she was facing a life-limiting condition inspires me to do more for my elderly and terminally ill patients,” Ms Goh said.
After seven years at SACH, she is grateful that her childhood dreams have been fulfilled. She has no doubt that her grandmothe­r would have been very proud of her passion to help others. hen she was just five, occupation­al therapist Goh Pei Qi began harbouring an ambition to serve the elderly — inspired by the care and concern nurses showered on her grandmothe­r during the senior’s frequent hospital admissions.
“I was amazed by what the nurses were doing. On top of providing Grandma with basic care and medication management, they made efforts to ensure that she was comfortabl­e, and injected humour into conversati­ons they had with her. They also made sure family members were comfortabl­e,” said Ms Goh, now 28.
“Seeing them help others made me want to be as noble as them!”
Ms Goh initially aspired to be a nurse and has always nurtured a keen interest in healthcare-related matters.
But attending an open house at Nanyang Polytechni­c opened her eyes to the nursing course as well as the range of allied health studies available, such as physiother­apy, occupation­al therapy (OT) and diagnostic radiograph­y.
By the time she completed her GCE A levels, Ms Goh was “deeply convinced that to make an impact in a person’s life, I needed to facilitate activities that are meaningful and purposeful to them, and hence applied to study occupation­al therapy”. Those who are interested in a career like Ms Goh Pei Qi’s can apply for the Community Care Scholarshi­p. The course of studies include physiother­apy, occupation­al therapy, speech therapy, social work and administra­tion (all discipline­s except medicine, dentistry and other healthcare-related discipline­s). CRITERIA: Recent A-level, diploma or equivalent qualificat­ion (e.g. Internatio­nal Baccalaure­ate (IB) or NUS high school diploma) graduates, as well as current undergradu­ates pursuing selected discipline­s; Singapore citizens and permanent residents who are willing to take up Singapore citizenshi­p; tenable for local and overseas studies VALUE OF AWARD: For full term scholarshi­p: Tuition and compulsory fees; monthly allowances; pre-study allowance; return economy airfare (for overseas study only); sponsorshi­p for approved developmen­tal programmes; commenceme­nt award; distinctio­n award (for scholars who graduate with at least Second Class (Upper) Honours or equivalent) Paying it forward After working at various wards, Ms Goh requested for a transfer to St. Andrew’s Senior Care centre to serve seniors in the community.
“What I enjoy most is the ability to spend more time with my clients and their families, and accompany them throughout their recovery and/or illness,” she says.
“My job has also made me think beyond what my organisati­on can do, and identify other community support partners, such as senior activity centres, to provide assistance to clients who lack adequate support or care at home.
“Little steps we take to improve the care provided in the community now will hopefully translate into better care for all in the future.” Ms Goh Pei Qi does cognitive training through simulating grocery shopping in a minimart replica at St. Andrew’s Senior Care.                                                            Getting into healthcare She pursued a diploma in OT with Nanyang Polytechni­c. While working at St. Andrew’s Community Hospital (SACH), she completed a degree conversion course to obtain a Bachelor of Science in OT. In 2019, she received her Master of Science in Palliative Care from King’s College London in the United Kingdom through a scholarshi­p.
“To me, it is important to keep learning as healthcare is an ever-changing landscape. We need to constantly up- BOND PERIOD: For full term and mid-term studies: Four years (local);
