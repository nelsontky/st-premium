    <p>ABLE TO FO­CUS ON CRI­SIS on tap­ping the Repub­lic’s re­serves to man­age the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy in the fu­ture will be more volatile.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of this, it is key that Sin­ga­pore­ans adopt a mind­set that the coun­try has to pre­pare for con­tin­gen­cies, “the one big un­known”, when plan­ning the use of its re­serves, rather than fo­cus on how much can be spent from the money ac­cu­mu­lated over the years, said Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Say­ing that he asked him­self all the time what fu­ture con­tin­gen­cies there could be that would re­quire the use of the re­serves, Mr Heng noted that in past years, Sin­ga­pore has al­ready had to con­front the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis, the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome (Sars) out­break and the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis. The cur­rent Covid-19 cri­sis re­mains far from over and, in fact, is be­com­ing more se­ri­ous, he said in the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to an ex­change between Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Work­ers’ Party chief Pri­tam Singh on the role of the re­serves in fund­ing so­cial spend­ing, he said: “I think we must ex­pect that pan­ics and crashes will con­tinue to hap­pen in the global econ­omy.”</p>
    <p>As an open econ­omy, Sin­ga­pore will be far more ex­posed than many other economies.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Minister for Eco­nomic Poli­cies and Fi­nance Minister, urged Mr Singh to bear in mind the fact that as a coun­try with no nat­u­ral re­sources of any kind, which has to “re­ally live by our wits”, hav­ing re­serves as a con­tin­gency fund gives</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore strength and al­lows it to keep jobs, re­struc­ture and re­form.</p>
    <p>Even in this cri­sis, the Gov­ern­ment was able to come up with pro­pos­als on look­ing be­yond Covid-19, due to the at­ti­tude that Sin­ga­pore has held to­wards the man­age­ment of its re­serves. “We owe some­thing not just to our­selves but to our fu­ture gen­er­a­tions,” said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>The Deputy Prime Minister also took Mr Singh up on his point on how the role of the re­serves can be re-ex­am­ined to ad­dress ques­tions of in­ter-gen­er­a­tional eq­uity.</p>
    <p>The Leader of the Op­po­si­tion had said the Work­ers’ Party’s in­ten­tion was not to raid the na­tional cof­fers that have been built up over the years, but to ex­am­ine the ex­tent to which the growth rate of the re­serves can be slowed to help fund so­cial needs, with­out touch­ing the prin­ci­pal amount.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said many coun­tries fund so­cial pro­grammes. “Some­body has to pay for those bor­row­ings. Who? Fu­ture gen­er­a­tions. The mas­sive debt that has been in­curred will have to be paid for by fu­ture gen­er­a­tions.”</p>
    <p>As Fi­nance Minister, he said, he felt grate­ful to Sin­ga­pore’s founders for leav­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans with the cur­rent re­serves, which he had to tap – only af­ter “very, very tough ques­tions” from the Pres­i­dent and the Coun­cil of Pres­i­den­tial Ad­vis­ers – to man­age the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“With these re­serves... my team and I were able to fo­cus fully on what would best serve the in­ter­ests of Sin­ga­pore­ans, how would we best help our busi­nesses, how would we best pro­vide re­sources for the front-line agen­cies, es­pe­cially the Min­istry of Health, to tackle this ma­jor cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t have to worry about what terms would I have to ne­go­ti­ate with lenders and how we are go­ing to pay for it,” said Mr Heng.</p>
