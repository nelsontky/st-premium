    <p>The 4,000 new and up­graded jobs that will open up in the en­vi­ron­men­tal ser­vice, food and agri-food in­dus­tries over the next year or so in­clude po­si­tions for pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians as well as rank-and-file work­ers.</p>
    <p>They in­clude skilled posts in the high-tech agri­cul­ture and aqua­cul­ture sec­tors, such as for plant sci­en­tists, agron­o­mists and aqua­cul­ture spe­cial­ists, the Min­istry of Sustainabi­lity and the En­vi­ron­ment (MSE) told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Work­ers with ex­per­tise in en­gi­neer­ing, science and en­vi­ron­men­tal man­age­ment will also be in demand as Sin­ga­pore looks to strengthen its waste man­age­ment and re­cy­cling in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>There will be op­por­tu­ni­ties as well for rank-and-file work­ers to learn new skills so they can take on higher-pay­ing jobs in more spe­cialised roles.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the MSE said it will help gen­eral clean­ers up­skill through ini­tia­tives such as a new course on en­vi­ron­men­tal in­fec­tion con­trol in non-health­care fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“With the en­hanced skill sets, clean­ing pro­fes­sion­als will be bet­ter equipped to take on more spe­cialised job roles, with im­proved salaries and ca­reer prospects,” said a spokesman.</p>
    <p>The min­istry was re­spond­ing to queries from ST on job prospects in the sustainabi­lity sec­tor, fol­low­ing news on Thurs­day that more po­si­tions will be cre­ated as Sin­ga­pore pur­sues sus­tain­able devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Sustainabi­lity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu noted that 55,000 new and up­graded jobs are ex­pected to be cre­ated in the next decade, in­clud­ing about 4,000 in the next year.</p>
    <p>She pointed to en­vi­ron­men­tal ser­vices, cli­mate re­search and agri­cul­ture and aqua­cul­ture as ar­eas of growth, due to the threats posed by pan­demics, cli­mate change and re­source con­straints.</p>
    <p>Ms Fu added that her min­istry will sup­port a “com­pet­i­tive tran­si­tion to a low-car­bon and cli­mate-re­silient fu­ture” by pro­mot­ing green growth and rid­ing on op­por­tu­ni­ties from de­car­bon­i­sa­tion and in­dus­tries such as car­bon ser­vices and cli­mate science.</p>
    <p>Asked for de­tails on this, the MSE spokesman pointed to Sin­ga­pore’s in­vest­ments in cli­mate science, and re­search and devel­op­ment for clean en­ergy op­tions such as car­bon cap­ture, util­i­sa­tion and stor­age (CCUS) tech­nolo­gies, and hy­dro­gen.</p>
    <p>CCUS tech­nolo­gies help re­move car­bon diox­ide from the at­mos­phere and store it or con­vert it into use­ful products such as con­crete, while hy­dro­gen is a po­ten­tial source of clean en­ergy when cou­pled with re­new­able en­ergy sys­tems.</p>
    <p>“As low-car­bon tech­nolo­gies are be­ing de­vel­oped and test-bed­ded in Sin­ga­pore to help us ad­dress our own en­ergy and cli­mate chal­lenges, they will also be use­ful to other cities fac­ing sim­i­lar chal­lenges,” said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>Part­ner­ing in­dus­try play­ers and in­vest­ing heav­ily in re­search, devel­op­ment and demon­stra­tion of th­ese tech­nolo­gies will al­low Sin­ga­pore-de­vel­oped so­lu­tions to be ex­ported glob­ally, he added.</p>
    <p>Ms Melissa Low, a cli­mate pol­icy re­searcher at the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS), noted that while sustainabi­lity is not a novel con­cept for Sin­ga­pore, it is the first time the Gov­ern­ment has of­fi­cially called for a push for a green recovery.</p>
    <p>“This is en­cour­ag­ing, es­pe­cially since we will all be op­er­at­ing in an in­creas­ingly car­bon-con­strained world with many coun­tries try­ing to cut their car­bon foot­print,” said Ms Low, a re­search fel­low at the NUS En­ergy Stud­ies In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>The heavy in­vest­ment in low-car­bon op­tions looks set to be a key part of Sin­ga­pore’s green recovery plan. And cre­at­ing new jobs in in­dus­tries that will help Sin­ga­pore pur­sue the low-car­bon fu­ture it has en­vi­sioned also en­sures that work­ers are not left be­hind, noted Ms Low.</p>
    <p>But she added that it was im­por­tant to see how MSE will work with other min­istries to in­cor­po­rate sustainabi­lity at the na­tional level.</p>
