    <p>Home owner Candy Chen has al­ways wanted a walk-up apart­ment, but find­ing one in a con­ve­nient and quiet lo­ca­tion was not easy.</p>
    <p>So when she and her hus­band found one above a quaint cof­fee shop in a tran­quil area of Bukit Timah, they looked past its awk­ward ex­ist­ing de­sign, fo­cused on its po­ten­tial and im­me­di­ately made an of­fer.</p>
    <p>The 40-year-old unit had four bed­rooms and just a bath­room and a toi­let as well as a nar­row ser­vice yard. The liv­ing and din­ing ar­eas shared one win­dow that did not let in suf­fi­cient nat­u­ral light.</p>
    <p>The three com­mon rooms with an un­der­utilised tri­an­gu­lar bal­cony wedged be­tween them, on the other hand, hoarded all the nat­u­ral light.</p>
    <p>And the mas­ter bed­room, po­si­tioned more like a ser­vice bed­room, was tucked away at the end of a long cor­ri­dor, ac­ces­si­ble only from the kitchen – once you got past the toi­let and the shower (each housed in a sep­a­rate, snug space).</p>
    <p>To­day, the unit is a sun­drenched open-plan apart­ment with a dark and sleek ma­te­rial palette, thanks to the de­sign­ers of home-grown in­te­rior de­sign com­pany UNO In­te­rior, who were also be­hind the look of the own­ers’ pre­vi­ous home.</p>
    <p>Ms Chen says: “We en­gaged UNO In­te­rior again be­cause we worked so well to­gether be­fore, and pretty much gave it free rein for the de­sign.”</p>
    <p>The brief was sim­ple: The cou­ple, who are in their 30s, wanted am­ple light, enough room and ameni­ties for their five cats and lots of open space where the male home owner, who works in the de­sign in­dus­try, could eas­ily and quickly lo­cate his things.</p>
    <p>“This was a chal­lenge for me be­cause when every­thing’s out in the open, things clut­ter eas­ily. Call it an oc­cu­pa­tional haz­ard, but I like to keep every­thing neat,” says Ms Chen, who owns a small bou­tique in Haji Lane.</p>
    <p>UNO In­te­rior had lit­tle trou­ble meet­ing both their needs and de­liv­er­ing a sweet spot that ap­pealed to both their per­son­al­i­ties. The cou­ple de­clined to re­veal the cost of the ren­o­va­tion. They moved into the apart­ment in May 2018.</p>
    <p>Com­pleted in 15 weeks, their new home has just one bed­room: the mas­ter bed­room. The other rooms and liv­ing and din­ing ar­eas have been merged into one large, open space lined with stor­age and dot­ted with pocket ar­eas for dif­fer­ent ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>While other walls were re­moved and fen­es­tra­tions en­larged, the kitchen was left com­pletely open. The din­ing counter, fea­tur­ing Sensa by Cosentino gran­ite top, segues into a work­ing space.</p>
    <p>The bed­room at the far end is now a sit­ting space, fea­tur­ing a book­shelf that flips open into a spare bed that can ac­com­mo­date overnight guests.</p>
    <p>Brought in­doors, the tri­an­gu­lar bal­cony is now another sit­ting area with planters.</p>
    <p>The liv­ing area con­sists sim­ply of a sofa, a cof­fee ta­ble and a TV mounted on a pole that has the space vis­ually seam­less.</p>
    <p>The en­trance to the mas­ter suite has been moved to make space for a pow­der room and given a new, over­sized pivot door that also leads to the walk-in wardrobe with rows of open racks with cloth­ing neatly hung by colours. It sits in a space that used to be the kitchen.</p>
    <p>Far­ther in­side, the orig­i­nal lay­out of the shower and toi­let re­mains, but all the fit­ting and fin­ishes are new.</p>
    <p>Now, there are no doors that sep­a­rate the three ar­eas in the mas­ter suite, leav­ing the vis­ual and spa­tial flow en­tirely un­in­ter­rupted.</p>
    <p>“We’d like to main­tain the open­ness since it’s just us and the cats here,” says Ms Chen.</p>
    <p>The cats, of course, helped shape the home’s aes­thetic.</p>
    <p>“One of the challenges was how to cat-proof the place with­out mak­ing it feel like a cage,” says the de­sign team.</p>
    <p>One of the many so­lu­tions: a cus­tom black metal grille on the win­dows, giv­ing the space a de­cid­edly in­dus­trial feel where they can roam in­de­pen­dently.</p>
    <p>The pivot door to the mas­ter suite fea­tures metal mesh to al­low them to climb up to the open shelv­ing above the kitchen cabi­net. Round open­ings in the car­pen­try pro­vide hid­ing spots and hide lit­ter boxes.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple’s pre­vi­ous home was a Hous­ing Board unit dressed mostly in white. This new home shifts the ma­te­rial palette to the op­po­site end of the monochro­matic spec­trum, play­ing up grey and black shades ac­cen­tu­ated by teak, plants and mir­rored fin­ishes.</p>
    <p>“The walls and ceil­ings are clad in screed ce­ment to give a neu­tral base,” says the team.</p>
    <p>It goes with the grey ter­razzo floor­ing con­tain­ing white mar­ble chip­pings, giv­ing the en­tire home a sub­tle, rich tex­ture.</p>
    <p>Now, here is one fash­ion­able home that is truly tai­lored for the home own­ers – all seven of them.</p>
