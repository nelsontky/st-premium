    <p>Born to a Ja­panese father and an English mother, An­drew Koji strug­gled for years to make it as an ac­tor in Bri­tain be­cause of lim­ited op­por­tu­ni­ties there for Asian per­form­ers.</p>
    <p>But that all changed when he was cast as the lead in War­rior (2019 to present) – the sexy, bloody, Bruce Lee-cre­ated pe­riod drama that has re­turned for a sec­ond sea­son on HBO Go and Cine­max (StarHub TV Chan­nel 611 and Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 424).</p>
    <p>Air­ing on Satur­days at 10am and 10pm, the story sprang from an idea the late mar­tial-arts legend had in the 1970s. Koji plays Ah Sahm, a mar­tial-arts prodigy who em­i­grates from China to San Fran­cisco in the late 1800s, only to find him­self em­broiled in Chi­na­town gang wars.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor, 32, spoke to the me­dia by video chat from London about his early strug­gles and what the show means for the por­trayal of Asians in the coro­n­avirus era.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>HE NEARLY QUIT ACT­ING BE­FORE GET­TING THIS PART</p>
    <p>Koji has been open about hav­ing strug­gled to make a liv­ing for the first decade or so of his ca­reer.</p>
    <p>This was be­cause of the lack of work for eth­nic-mi­nor­ity ac­tors in Bri­tain, where he grew up.</p>
    <p>For a half-Asian, half-white ac­tor like him­self, it was of­ten a case of be­ing “not Asian enough” for cer­tain parts but also “not Cau­casian enough for oth­ers”, he says.</p>
    <p>2 3</p>
    <p>LONG-TIME LOVE OF MAR­TIAL ARTS WAR­RIOR MEANS A LOT</p>
    <p>TO ASIAN FANS</p>
    <p>As a child, Koji’s idol was Hong Kong ac­tion star Jackie Chan. “He was the first per­son I saw that looked like me on the screen, and he was kick­ing ass and he was bril­liant.”</p>
    <p>Ob­sessed with fight­ing-themed video game Tekken, Koji took up taek­wondo at the age of 10 and threw him­self into it for a few years. “I wanted to be the char­ac­ter Hwoarang, the taek­wondo kicker.”</p>
    <p>But a com­pe­ti­tion in­jury put an end to that. Koji be­gan study­ing gongfu at a Shaolin tem­ple in Eng­land, and be­came “at­tracted to the more per­for­mance-based, wushu stuff”.</p>
    <p>He is also at­tracted to the rigour and rou­tine that mar­tial arts of­fer.</p>
    <p>“I think maybe a lot of peo­ple are in­ter­ested in it be­cause it gives you dis­ci­pline. That could be why it had a huge fol­low­ing when it first came to the West, be­cause a lot of peo­ple miss that in Western cul­ture.”</p>
    <p>The cast of the se­ries – which also stars Olivia Cheng and Dian Doan – are of­ten ap­proached by ex­cited fans.</p>
    <p>The first sea­son was gen­er­ally well-re­ceived by crit­ics, but it took a while for the ac­tors to re­alise the im­pres­sion it had left on Asian au­di­ences, Koji says.</p>
    <p>“I was film­ing some­thing i n Canada, where there’s a huge Asian com­mu­nity, and peo­ple would come up and talk to me about the show.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause this is the story of their an­ces­tors – a part of his­tory their dis­tant fam­ily had been through, even though it is be­ing shown within this height­ened fan­tasy world,” he adds.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>IT SPOT­LIGHTS A LIT­TLE-KNOWN CHAP­TER OF HIS­TORY</p>
    <p>The show looks at the prej­u­dice faced by Chi­nese im­mi­grants to the United States dur­ing this time, which saw the pass­ing of the Chi­nese Ex­clu­sion Act in 1882, a law that stopped all im­mi­gra­tion by labour­ers from China.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing into War­rior, I had no prior knowl­edge of this or the po­lit­i­cal cli­mate back then,” Koji says.</p>
    <p>“I’d only seen Chi­nese rail­way work­ers in the back­ground in some films, but they were never fo­cused on. And the more I learnt about what they went through, it felt like we were mak­ing some­thing im­por­tant.”</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>IT TACK­LES ANTI-CHI­NESE SEN­TI­MENT OVER COVID-19</p>
    <p>Koji thinks the his­tor­i­cal set­ting of War­rior is par­tic­u­larly rel­e­vant this year.</p>
    <p>“The ironic thing we’re ex­pe­ri­enc­ing with War­rior is the cul­tural rel­e­vance it’s hav­ing now, es­pe­cially with the coro­n­avirus and this anti-Chi­nese sen­ti­ment out there,” he says.</p>
    <p>“It’s ben­e­fi­cial for us to learn about his­tory be­cause then we can kind of look at it and go: ‘How much have we re­ally changed?’”</p>
    <p>War­rior 2 airs on Satur­days at 10am and 10pm on Cine­max (StarHub TV Chan­nel 611, Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 424) and HBO Go.</p>
