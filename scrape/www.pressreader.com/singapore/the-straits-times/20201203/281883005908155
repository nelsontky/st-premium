    <p>The goals of the United Na­tions Paris Cli­mate Agree­ment now seem more within reach af­ter re­cent pledges by major car­bon pol­lut­ing na­tions, ac­cord­ing to a re­cent re­port.</p>
    <p>In an anal­y­sis of new cli­mate prom­ises from China and other coun­tries, along with the car­bon plans of United States Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den, the Cli­mate Ac­tion Tracker (CAT) group found that the rise in world tem­per­a­tures could be held to 2.1 deg C by the end of this cen­tury if the new prom­ises are kept.</p>
    <p>It is still sig­nif­i­cantly above the 1.5 deg C limit that the UN’s cli­mate panel said the world should aim for, but far bet­ter than the 3.5 deg C rise the world was on track to reach prior to the Paris deal.</p>
    <p>Un­der the 2015 pact, nearly 200 na­tions agreed to limit global warm­ing to well be­low 2 deg C and aim for 1.5 deg C if pos­si­ble to re­duce the risks from a rapidly warm­ing world.</p>
    <p>Un­til re­cently, the com­bined emis­sions-cut­ting pledges of all coun­tries meant the world was on track to warm about 3 deg C above pre-in­dus­trial lev­els by the end of the cen­tury.</p>
    <p>While the long-term pic­ture has im­proved, the au­thors said it is vi­tal for na­tions to ramp up emis­sions cuts this decade as cli­mat­e­change im­pacts are be­ing in­creas­ingly felt, from more ex­treme heat­waves, droughts and wild­fires to more se­vere storms and floods.</p>
    <p>“We see emis­sions con­tin­u­ing to rise through to 2030, which will not get them onto the kind of path­way that will al­low gov­ern­ments to meet their am­bi­tious net-zero com­mit­ments,” Dr Bill Hare of Cli­mate An­a­lyt­ics, one of CAT’s part­ner or­gan­i­sa­tions, said in a state­ment on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>What ur­gently needs to hap­pen is for na­tions to sub­mit much more am­bi­tious pledges to cut emis­sions by 2030, the au­thors added.</p>
    <p>In UN lan­guage, these pledges are called Na­tion­ally De­ter­mined Con­tri­bu­tions (NDC). Coun­tries are meant to sub­mit new or up­dated pledges by the end of this year as part of the Paris Agree­ment’s process of pro­gres­sively in­creas­ing global am­bi­tion.</p>
    <p>“No large emit­ter has yet sub­mit­ted a sub­stan­tially up­dated NDC (for the 2030 tar­get), and the emis­sions gap is huge. Short-term tar­gets are not a lit­tle bit off, they are to­tally off. Near-term ac­tion and poli­cies need to be ramped up con­sid­er­ably,” said Dr Hare, who helped lead CAT’s anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>Na­tions have to sub­mit pro­gres­sively more am­bi­tious car­bon-cut­ting pledges ev­ery five years.</p>
    <p>The lat­est anal­y­sis looked at the im­pact of a flurry of net-zero emis­sions pledges in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>In a Septem­ber ad­dress to the UN Gen­eral As­sem­bly, Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping pledged that China’s emis­sions would peak be­fore 2030 and would be car­bon neu­tral by 2060 – a dra­matic shift for the world’s top car­bon pol­luter and coal con­sumer. Soon af­ter, Ja­pan and South Korea pledged to be car­bon neu­tral by 2050, while Mr Bi­den’s plan is to reach net zero car­bon emis­sions by 2050.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, Mr Bi­den, who will be­come Pres­i­dent on Jan 20, has pledged to spend US$2 tril­lion</p>
    <p>(S$2.7 tril­lion) over four years on green en­ergy, trans­port and in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Union i n July agreed to de­vote nearly €550 bil­lion (S$888 bil­lion) to green projects over the next seven years – the largest sin­gle cli­mate pledge ever made.</p>
    <p>The CAT anal­y­sis found that China’s 2060 pledge, if achieved, would re­duce the end of cen­tury warm­ing es­ti­mate by 0.2 to 0.3 deg C. Another 0.1 deg C could be shaved off if the US is car­bon neu­tral by 2050.</p>
    <p>South Africa and Canada have also re­cently an­nounced net-zero tar­gets. In to­tal, 127 coun­tries re­spon­si­ble for around 63 per cent of emis­sions are con­sid­er­ing or have adopted net zero tar­gets, the re­port noted.</p>
    <p>The car­bon neu­tral­ity goals would mean na­tions largely shift­ing away from fos­sil fuels and dra­mat­i­cally ramp­ing up the use of re­new­able en­ergy and other clean en­ergy sources.</p>
    <p>“I think ev­ery­one can be more hope­ful that the world can take suf­fi­cient mea­sures be­cause of the change in po­lit­i­cal sup­port for get­ting to net zero emis­sions by 2050, with the big caveat that what we’re see­ing is by far in­suf­fi­cient,” Dr Hare told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“But to re­tain any cred­i­bil­ity, gov­ern­ments will need to bring their 2030 tar­gets into line with their net zero goals by around 2050, and this is the main po­lit­i­cal chal­lenge ahead in the next 12 months,” he said, re­fer­ring to a major UN cli­mate meet­ing, called COP26, to be held in Glas­gow at the end of next year.</p>
    <p>Cli­mate sci­en­tists said deep cuts this decade are vi­tal given the planet has al­ready warmed 1.1 deg C and this year is on track to be among the warm­est on record.</p>
