    <p>United States Pres­i­dent Donald Trump is “do­ing very well” after be­ing treated with ex­per­i­men­tal an­tivi­ral drug remde­sivir at a mil­i­tary hos­pi­tal where he was taken on Fri­day after his Covid-19 di­ag­no­sis, his doc­tors said.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump was fever-free for a full day as at yes­ter­day morn­ing and his med­i­cal team was “ex­tremely happy with the progress the Pres­i­dent has made”, his physi­cian Sean Con­ley said at a press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s car­diac, kid­ney and liver func­tions were all nor­mal and he was not hav­ing dif­fi­culty breath­ing or walk­ing around, his doc­tors said, adding that they were cau­tiously op­ti­mistic.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump was in ex­cep­tion­ally good spir­its and said he felt like he could walk out of the hos­pi­tal that very day, they added. How­ever US me­dia, cit­ing un­named sources, re­ported that Mr Trump is not yet in the clear, and that some of his vi­tal signs over the last 24 hours were very con­cern­ing.</p>
    <p>A widen­ing cir­cle of top Trump aides and Repub­li­can law­mak­ers said they had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 on Fri­day, rais­ing ques­tions whether they and oth­ers might have been in­fected at a White House event last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Among those with Covid-19 were for­mer White House se­nior ad­viser Kellyanne Con­way, Repub­li­can sen­a­tors Mike Lee of Utah and Thom Til­lis of North Carolina, and Univer­sity of Notre Dame pres­i­dent John I. Jenk­ins.</p>
    <p>They at­tended an out­door cer­e­mony where Mr Trump un­veiled</p>
    <p>Judge Amy Coney Bar­rett as his nom­i­nee to the Supreme Court.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­can Na­tional Com­mit­tee chair Ronna McDaniel and Trump cam­paign man­ager Bill Stepien, who were in fre­quent con­tact with Mr Trump and at­tended Tues­day’s pres­i­den­tial de­bate in Cleve­land, Ohio, also tested pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump was “fa­tigued but in good spir­its” as at Fri­day af­ter­noon, while wife Me­la­nia, who also tested pos­i­tive, re­mained well with only a mild cough and headache, said Dr Con­ley.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent was un­char­ac­ter­is­ti­cally silent on Twit­ter for most of the day after an­nounc­ing his di­ag­no­sis, but in his first pub­lic com­ments in the evening, he said he be­lieves he is “do­ing very well”.</p>
    <p>“I want to thank ev­ery­body for the tremen­dous sup­port,” said Mr Trump in a brief video mes­sage on Twit­ter, posted around the time he ar­rived by he­li­copter at Wal­ter Reed Na­tional Mil­i­tary Med­i­cal Cen­tre in Bethesda, Mary­land.</p>
    <p>“I think I’m do­ing very well. But we’re go­ing to make sure that things work out. The First Lady is do­ing very well,” he said.</p>
    <p>As he left the White House to board the Marine One he­li­copter, Mr Trump gave a thumbs-up to re­porters and a short wave but did not take ques­tions. Wear­ing a mask, he walked nor­mally on his own with­out any out­ward sign of trou­ble, said a me­dia pool re­port.</p>
    <p>Dr Con­ley said in a state­ment that Mr Trump re­ceived a sin­gle 8g dose of biotech com­pany Re­gen­eron’s an­ti­body cock­tail, and com­pleted the in­fu­sion with­out in­ci­dent. It is one of sev­eral ex­per­i­men­tal Covid-19 drugs known as mon­o­clonal an­ti­bod­ies that are used to treat a wide range of ill­nesses.</p>
    <p>Remde­sivir, which the Pres­i­dent is also tak­ing, has short­ened hos­pi­tal stays for some coro­n­avirus pa­tients. Mr Trump has also been tak­ing zinc, vi­ta­min D, famo­ti­dine, mela­tonin and a daily as­pirin, Dr Con­ley added.</p>
    <p>Late on Fri­day night, Mr Trump tweeted: “Go­ing welI, I think! Thank you to all. Love!!!”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the day, press sec­re­tary Kayleigh McE­nany said: “Out of an abun­dance of cau­tion, and at the rec­om­men­da­tion of his physi­cian and med­i­cal ex­perts, the Pres­i­dent will be work­ing from the pres­i­den­tial of­fices at Wal­ter Reed for the next few days.”</p>
    <p>Sev­eral world lead­ers sent their good wishes to Mr Trump and his wife, in­clud­ing Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mo­hamed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, New Zealand Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.</p>
    <p>“My wife, Peng Liyuan, and I ex­press our sym­pa­thies to you and your wife and wish you a fast re­cov­ery,” Chi­nese state me­dia quoted Mr Xi as say­ing.</p>
    <p>My wife, Peng Liyuan, and I ex­press our sym­pa­thies to you and your wife and wish ’’ you a fast re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>CHI­NESE PRES­I­DENT XI JIN­PING, as cited by Chi­nese state me­dia, join­ing world lead­ers in send­ing a mes­sage of sup­port to the US Pres­i­dent and his wife fol­low­ing their coro­n­avirus di­ag­no­sis.</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Two Repub­li­can sen­a­tors on the piv­otal Se­nate Ju­di­ciary Com­mit­tee have tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 after at­tend­ing re­cent White House events an­nounc­ing United States Pres­i­dent Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nom­i­nee Amy Coney Bar­rett, throw­ing the fu­ture of her con­fir­ma­tion hear­ings into ques­tion.</p>
    <p>Se­na­tor Thom Til­lis of North Carolina and Se­na­tor Mike Lee of Utah, who an­nounced their test re­sults on Fri­day, are among sev­eral peo­ple who have tested pos­i­tive since at­tend­ing the events. A third se­na­tor, Repub­li­can Ron John­son, chair­man of the Se­nate Home­land Se­cu­rity Com­mit­tee, was di­ag­nosed with the dis­ease yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers in­clude Mr Trump’s cam­paign man­ager Bill Stepien, First Lady Me­la­nia Trump, Univer­sity of Notre Dame pres­i­dent John I. Jenk­ins and for­mer top White House ad­viser Kellyanne Con­way.</p>
    <p>The Sept 26 Rose Gar­den cer­e­mony for Ms Bar­rett was un­likely to be a “su­per spreader” event as it was out­doors. But many top Repub­li­cans at­tended with­out masks or so­cial dis­tanc­ing, rais­ing con­cerns that oth­ers might have con­tracted the virus but did not yet know. And some­one in­fected but asymp­to­matic could have trans­mit­ted the virus to oth­ers at in­door dis­cus­sions in the White House.</p>
    <p>Lead­ing Repub­li­cans said they planned to con­tinue “full steam ahead” to con­firm Ms Bar­rett be­fore Elec­tion Day. But Mr Trump’s ill­ness, along with the fact that Mr Til­lis and Mr Lee sit on the Ju­di­ciary Com­mit­tee, has raised ques­tions about whether the party’s am­bi­tious timetable can hold.</p>
    <p>Mr Til­lis’ di­ag­no­sis also dealt a blow to Repub­li­cans’ hopes of re­tain­ing con­trol of the Se­nate, given that he was al­ready fac­ing a dif­fi­cult re-elec­tion bat­tle.</p>
    <p>Top Se­nate Democrats on Fri­day de­manded that Repub­li­cans slow their plans for con­firm­ing Ms Bar­rett, say­ing that if they pro­ceed with hear­ings with­out an un­der­stand­ing of the ex­tent of the virus’ spread from the Sept 26 events, an “al­ready il­le­git­i­mate process will be­come a dan­ger­ous one”.</p>
    <p>Se­na­tor Chuck Schumer of New York, the Demo­cratic leader, called on Repub­li­cans to de­lay the con­fir­ma­tion hear­ings.</p>
    <p>“We now have two mem­bers of the Se­nate Ju­di­ciary Com­mit­tee who have tested pos­i­tive for Covid, and there may be more,” Mr Schumer said. “It is ir­re­spon­si­ble and dan­ger­ous to move for­ward with a hear­ing, and there is ab­so­lutely no good rea­son to do so.”</p>
    <p>The con­fir­ma­tion of a sixth con­ser­va­tive-lean­ing justice to the court would be the cul­mi­na­tion of a decades-long con­ser­va­tive project, an ef­fort spear­headed by the Se­nate Ma­jor­ity Leader, Se­na­tor Mitch McCon­nell of Ken­tucky.</p>
    <p>Ms Bar­rett, 48, tested neg­a­tive on Fri­day, a White House of­fi­cial said. Two of­fi­cials with knowl­edge of her med­i­cal his­tory said that she al­ready had the coro­n­avirus and re­cov­ered ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Ms Bar­rett was in close con­tact with Mr Trump at the White House last week­end. She also worked closely with sev­eral White House of­fi­cials and met dozens of Repub­li­can sen­a­tors on Capi­tol Hill, in­clud­ing Mr McCon­nell and Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>A video posted on Twit­ter showed Mr Lee hug­ging peo­ple at the event. He said he had tested neg­a­tive at the White House the pre­vi­ous Satur­day.</p>
    <p>It can take sev­eral days for some­one who has been ex­posed to the virus to de­velop symp­toms or to test pos­i­tive. Any­one tested within just a day or two of ex­po­sure is likely to re­ceive a neg­a­tive re­sult even if they are in­fected.</p>
    <p>Se­na­tor Lind­sey Graham of South Carolina, the Ju­di­ciary Com­mit­tee chair­man, said on Fri­day his panel would be­gin four days of pub­lic hear­ings on Ms Bar­rett’s nom­i­na­tion on Oct 12 as sched­uled. Mr Til­lis and Mr Lee said they would iso­late them­selves for 10 days, which would en­able them to</p>
    <p>emerge in time for the hear­ings.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view on Fri­day, Mr McCon­nell sug­gested the virus’ spread through Repub­li­can cir­cles could mean more law­mak­ers would par­tic­i­pate in the hear­ings vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>“This sort of un­der­scores the need to do that,” he said.</p>
    <p>But Democrats said that vir­tual hear­ings on such a con­se­quen­tial mat­ter would be un­ac­cept­able.</p>
