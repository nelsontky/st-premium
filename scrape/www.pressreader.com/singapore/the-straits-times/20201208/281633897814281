    <p>•</p>
    <p>The United States is pre­par­ing to im­pose sanc­tions on at least a dozen Chi­nese of­fi­cials over their al­leged role in Bei­jing’s dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion of elected op­po­si­tion leg­is­la­tors in Hong Kong, ac­cord­ing to three sources, in­clud­ing a US of­fi­cial fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The sanc­tions, which were set to be rolled out as early as yes­ter­day, will tar­get of­fi­cials from the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP) as Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion keeps up pres­sure on Bei­jing in his fi­nal weeks in of­fice.</p>
    <p>Up to 14 peo­ple, in­clud­ing of­fi­cials of China’s Par­lia­ment, or Na­tional Peo­ple’s Congress, and mem­bers of the CCP, would likely be tar­geted by mea­sures such as as­set freezes and fi­nan­cial sanc­tions, two sources said.</p>
    <p>The US of­fi­cial, speak­ing on con­di­tion of anonymity, said mul­ti­ple in­di­vid­u­als would be sanc­tioned.</p>
    <p>A per­son fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said the group would likely in­clude of­fi­cials from Hong Kong as well as the main­land. The sources did not pro­vide names or po­si­tions of those be­ing tar­geted for sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>Two sources cau­tioned that an an­nounce­ment could still be de­layed un­til later in the week.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Hua Chun­y­ing said yes­ter­day, with­out elab­o­rat­ing, that Bei­jing would take coun­ter­mea­sures should the US con­tinue down the “wrong path”.</p>
    <p>“If the re­ports are true, I be­lieve you can imag­ine China’s po­si­tion,” Ms Hua said. “We firmly op­pose and strongly con­demn US in­ter­fer­ence in China’s in­ter­nal af­fairs and sanc­tions on Chi­nese per­son­nel un­der the pre­text of Hong Kong. We have ex­pressed our po­si­tions to the US side many times and made le­git­i­mate and nec­es­sary re­sponses.”</p>
    <p>Ms Hua spoke hours af­ter Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi told the US-China Business Coun­cil that Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing should “work to­gether” to “achieve a smooth tran­si­tion” of ties once Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den takes over the reins of the US next month.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, the US State De­part­ment warned in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions do­ing business with in­di­vid­u­als deemed re­spon­si­ble for China’s crack­down in the Asian fi­nan­cial hub that they could soon face tough sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton had al­ready put sanc­tions on Hong Kong Chief Executive Car­rie Lam, the ter­ri­tory’s cur­rent and for­mer po­lice chiefs and other top of­fi­cials in Au­gust for what it said was their role in cur­tail­ing free­doms in a crack­down on the ter­ri­tory’s pro-democ­racy move­ment.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam re­cently said she was col­lect­ing “piles of cash” at home as the mea­sures barred her from ba­sic bank­ing ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump in­di­cated to aides in July that he did not want to fur­ther es­ca­late ten­sions with China and had ruled out ad­di­tional sanc­tions on top of­fi­cials at that time.</p>
    <p>Be­fore that, his team had cre­ated a list of of­fi­cials that in­cluded Chi­nese Vice-Premier Han Zheng, a mem­ber of the CCP’s pow­er­ful seven-mem­ber Polit­buro Stand­ing Com­mit­tee, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter who spoke on con­di­tion of anonymity.</p>
    <p>An even more se­nior tar­get would be Na­tional Peo­ple’s Congress chair­man Li Zhan­shu, the party’s No. 3 of­fi­cial and Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s for­mer chief of staff. The leg­isla­tive body led by Mr Li has been di­rectly re­spon­si­ble for China’s most con­tro­ver­sial mea­sures on Hong Kong in re­cent months, in­clud­ing the res­o­lu­tion de­mand­ing law­mak­ers’ loy­alty to Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong is ex­pected to be one of Mr Bi­den’s thorni­est chal­lenges with China, with re­la­tions be­tween Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing at the low­est point in decades over an ar­ray of dis­putes.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has promised to take a tougher line than Mr Trump on hu­man rights in China and other coun­tries, so his re­sponse to the crack­down in Hong Kong could be an early test of that re­solve.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong has con­tin­ued to be rocked by po­lit­i­cal up­heaval in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>The pro-democ­racy law­mak­ers’ de­par­ture from the leg­is­la­ture fu­elled con­cern about Hong Kong’s au­ton­omy from Bei­jing in the wake of China-drafted na­tional se­cu­rity leg­is­la­tion im­posed on the for­mer Bri­tish colony in June.</p>
    <p>The Five Eyes in­tel­li­gence-shar­ing group – made up of Aus­tralia, Bri­tain, Canada, New Zealand and the US – said last month that the move ap­peared to be part of a cam­paign to si­lence crit­ics and called on Bei­jing to re­verse course.</p>
    <p>White House Na­tional Se­cu­rity Ad­viser Robert O’Brien said last month that the ex­pul­sion showed the “one coun­try, two sys­tems” for­mula, un­der which Hong Kong’s au­ton­omy had been promised af­ter Bri­tain handed the ter­ri­tory back to China in 1997, was now “merely a fig leaf” and promised fur­ther US ac­tion.</p>
