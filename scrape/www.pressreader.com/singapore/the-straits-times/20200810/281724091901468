    <p>There were 175 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 55,104, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The min­istry also said the In­ter­a­gency Task­force had com­pleted the test­ing of all work­ers in dor­mi­to­ries last Friday, with some test results still be­ing pro­cessed.</p>
    <p>Among the new cases yes­ter­day is an un­linked com­mu­nity case, a 57-year-old Sin­ga­porean woman.</p>
    <p>She was tested for Covid-19 af­ter she sought med­i­cal treat­ment for pro­longed acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion symp­toms, and tested pos­i­tive on Satur­day, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>It said epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions of the case are in progress, and all iden­ti­fied close con­tacts have been iso­lated and placed on quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>They will be tested at the start and end of their quar­an­tine pe­riod so that asymp­to­matic cases can be de­tected, said MOH.</p>
    <p>There were also three im­ported cases – a Sin­ga­porean who re­turned from In­dia on July 25, and two work pass hold­ers, In­dian na­tion­als who ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore from In­dia on July 26.</p>
    <p>Upon their ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, they went to ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties to serve their stay-home no­tices, where they were tested for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dormi</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble, at an av­er­age of two cases per day in the past 14 days.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity also re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of one case per day in the past 14 days.</p>
    <p>tories made up the re­main­ing 171 cases yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>About 23,500 work­ers are still serv­ing out their iso­la­tion pe­riod at quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“The work­ers in th­ese quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties will be tested when their iso­la­tion ends, and we ex­pect the case counts to re­main high in the com­ing days, be­fore ta­per­ing down there­after,” said MOH.</p>
    <p>The min­istry also said the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble, at an av­er­age of two cases per day in the past 14 days.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity also re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of one case per day in the past 14 days.</p>
    <p>Another 332 cases have been dis­charged, which means that as of Satur­day, a to­tal of 48,900 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>There were 135 Covid-19 pa­tients still in hospi­tal and 6,027 pa­tients re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties here.</p>
    <p>Most pa­tients are im­prov­ing and in a sta­ble con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>None is in the in­ten­sive care unit. Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, the virus out­break, which be­gan in De­cem­ber last year, has in­fected more than 19.8 mil­lion peo­ple. More than 730,000 peo­ple have died.</p>
