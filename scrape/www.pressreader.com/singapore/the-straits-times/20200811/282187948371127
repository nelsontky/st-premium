    <p>BEI­JING • China’s fac­tory de­fla­tion eased last month, driven by a rise in global oil prices and as in­dus­trial ac­tiv­ity climbed back towards pre-coro­n­avirus lev­els, adding to signs of re­cov­ery in the world’s sec­ond-largest econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The pro­ducer price in­dex fell 2.4 per cent from a year ear­lier, the Na­tional Bureau of Statis­tics said, com­pared with a 2.5 per cent de­cline tipped in a Reuters poll of an­a­lysts and a 3 per cent drop in June.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say China’s in­dus­trial out­put is steadily re­turn­ing to lev­els seen be­fore the pan­demic paral­ysed huge swathes of the econ­omy, as pent-up de­mand, gov­ern­ment stim­u­lus and sur­pris­ingly re­silient ex­ports pro­pel a re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Iron ore fu­tures prices i n Dalian have ral­lied over 50 per cent so far this year, while prices of steel bars used in con­struc­tion have jumped 12 per cent.</p>
    <p>But some economists warn the re­cov­ery could stall amid cau­tious con­sumer spend­ing and a resur­gence in global in­fec­tions. Floods have also dis­rupted pro­duc­tion in parts of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Con­sumer in­fla­tion edged up last month as the bad weather pushed food prices higher. The con­sumer price in­dex (CPI) rose 2.7 per cent from a year ear­lier, com­pared with an ex­pected 2.6 per cent in­crease and a 2.5 per cent rise in June. Pork prices rose 85.7 per cent on a yearly ba­sis.</p>
    <p>How­ever, core in­fla­tion, which ex­cludes food and en­ergy costs, rose a mere 0.5 per cent last month from a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>“The higher-than-ex­pected price in­crease will strengthen the de­ter­mi­na­tion of the mone­tary au­thor­i­ties to nor­malise poli­cies,” said chief macro an­a­lyst at Shang­hai Se­cu­ri­ties Hu Yuex­iao.</p>
    <p>The slow­down in fac­tory de­fla­tion is bet­ter news for cor­po­rate profits and com­pa­nies’ ca­pa­bil­ity to ex­pand in­vest­ment. The credit boom has “failed to boost core in­fla­tion” as prices of most ser­vices are de­clin­ing due to on­go­ing anti-virus mea­sures across the na­tion, said econ­o­mist Xing Zhaopeng from the Aus­tralia and New Zealand Bank­ing Group in Shang­hai.</p>
    <p>China’s econ­omy is con­tin­u­ing its grad­ual re­cov­ery into the sec­ond half of the year, driven by pro­duc­tion re­sump­tions and the re­lease of pent-up de­mand.</p>
    <p>Fu­tures con­tracts on China’s 10-year gov­ern­ment bonds climbed as much as 0.3 per cent yes­ter­day, the most in more than two weeks. That re­flects a drop in risk ap­petite and stronger ex­pec­ta­tions for mone­tary eas­ing, prompted by the slide in core in­fla­tion and the eas­ing of a rally in stocks.</p>
    <p>“The mod­er­a­tion in core CPI was mainly due to tourist pack­age prices – we usu­ally see a price in­crease in July due to the hol­i­day sea­son, whereas prices de­clined by 1.5 per cent month on month last month,” said Ms Michelle Lam, greater China econ­o­mist at So­ci­ete Gen­erale in Hong Kong. “The mod­er­a­tion re­flects broader weak­ness in the con­sumer ser­vice sec­tor, which would re­cover only grad­u­ally due to Covid-19.”</p>
