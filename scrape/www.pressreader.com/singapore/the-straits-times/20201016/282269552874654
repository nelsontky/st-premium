    <p>LIS­BON • No Cris­tiano Ron­aldo, no prob­lem. That was the take­away from Wed­nes­day’s Na­tions League match, as Por­tu­gal made light of their star player’s ab­sence due to a pos­i­tive Covid-19 test to see off Swe­den 3-0 and stay top of their group.</p>
    <p>A Diogo Jota brace and another strike from Bernardo Silva were enough to stay level on 10 points with France and hold on to first place in League A Group 3.</p>
    <p>Ron­aldo, who posted a photo of him­self on so­cial me­dia watch­ing the match on tele­vi­sion wear­ing a Por­tu­gal top, was forced to leave the na­tional team camp after re­turn­ing a pos­i­tive test for Covid-19 on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The Ju­ven­tus for­ward re­turned to Italy on Wed­nes­day to con­tinue his self-iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>His Por­tu­gal team­mates had few prob­lems deal­ing with Swe­den, who have now lost all four of their Na­tions League matches and are rock bot­tom of the group.</p>
    <p>The Swedes are three points be­hind Croa­tia, who were beaten 2-1 by France in Za­greb.</p>
    <p>“We are not bet­ter with­out Ron­aldo, but the team had shown be­fore that we’re ca­pa­ble of suc­ceed­ing with­out him,” Por­tu­gal coach Fer­nando San­tos said.</p>
    <p>“We were well-or­gan­ised of­fen­sively, 3-0 is a great re­sult. We did some very good things, then we let Swe­den cre­ate a few prob­lems for us be­fore we re­gained con­trol of the game. Swe­den could have scored a goal or two, but we too could have scored more.</p>
    <p>“This team will al­ways be bet­ter with Cris­tiano, but we are still able to fight for our goals.”</p>
    <p>Silva curled home the opener in the 21st minute thanks to un­selfish play from Jota, who laid on the ball for the Manch­ester City mid­fielder in­stead of go­ing for goal him­self when in a promis­ing po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Fel­low Premier League star Jota made it two just be­fore the break when, com­pletely un­marked, he chested down Joao Cancelo’s beau­ti­fully flighted pass and slot­ted home.</p>
    <p>The new Liver­pool sign­ing then put the re­sult be­yond any doubt in the 72nd minute with a su­perb in­di­vid­ual goal, weav­ing in from the left be­fore drilling a low fin­ish past Swe­den goal­keeper Robin Olsen.</p>
    <p>“It was an ex­cel­lent night, and one of my best per­for­mances for my coun­try,” Jota said, be­fore adding that there was “no pres­sure” to re­place Ron­aldo.</p>
    <p>“The coach chooses the eleven for each game. We are pro­fes­sion­als and, if the boss chooses 11 play­ers to en­ter the field, these are the ones who have to work.”</p>
    <p>Manch­ester United play­maker Bruno Fer­nan­des also said that it felt like busi­ness as usual de­spite not hav­ing Ron­aldo on the pitch.</p>
    <p>He said: “We were not asked to play any dif­fer­ently (with­out him), our am­bi­tion re­mains the same. But it is ob­vi­ous that it is eas­ier to win with the best (player) in the world.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Italy lost top spot in League A Group 1 after a 1-1 draw against the Nether­lands in Berg­amo.</p>
    <p>The Az­zurri had won 1-0 in Am­s­ter­dam last month but have now been held in three of their last four matches, in­clud­ing Sun­day’s goal­less draw against Poland in Gdansk.</p>
    <p>Roberto Mancini’s side dropped to sec­ond in their group on six points, one be­hind the Poles, who beat Bosnia and Herze­gov­ina 3-0.</p>
