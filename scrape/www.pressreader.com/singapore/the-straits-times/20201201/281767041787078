    <p>• New York City will re­open el­e­men­tary schools on Dec 7 and of­fer in-per­son classes for spe­cial needs stu­dents of all ages de­spite a re­cent surge in coro­n­avirus cases, Mayor Bill de Bla­sio has said.</p>
    <p>With many par­ents strug­gling to care for stu­dents at home and with data show­ing the virus l argely spares young chil­dren, the city dropped a re­quire­ment for schools to close if the rate of pos­i­tive virus tests ex­ceeds 3 per cent for a week. New York, home to the coun­try’s largest school district, cur­rently has a 3.1 per cent rate.</p>
    <p>The mayor told re­porters on Sun­day the re­open­ing was pos­si­ble “be­cause we have so much proof now of how safe schools can be”. He said re­turn­ing stu­dents would be sub­jected to weekly Covid-19 tests.</p>
    <p>He also said on Twit­ter that five­day in-per­son in­struc­tion would be the pre­ferred model for schools with space to al­low so­cial dis­tanc­ing. Up to now, in-per­son school has been of­fered only two or three times a week.</p>
    <p>“We want our kids in the class­room for as much time as pos­si­ble,” Mayor de Bla­sio, a Demo­crat, said. “Our fam­i­lies do, too. We’ll work to make it hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>New York state Gov­er­nor An­drew Cuomo voiced sup­port for wel­com­ing back its younger stu­dents. “Just about ev­ery pro­fes­sional says the schools, es­pe­cially K-8, should be kept open when­ever it’s pos­si­ble to keep them open safely,” he said, re­fer­ring to the first nine years of school in the US.</p>
    <p>Classes for New York’s mid­dle school and high school stu­dents – ex­cept for those with spe­cial needs – will re­main on­line.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, top US sci­en­tist An­thony Fauci warned on Sun­day that Amer­ica should pre­pare for a “surge upon a surge” in coro­n­avirus cases as mil­lions of trav­ellers re­turn home af­ter the Thanks­giv­ing hol­i­day. The United States is the worst-af­fected coun­try with over 266,887 Covid-19 deaths, and Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion has is­sued con­flict­ing mes­sages on maskwear­ing, travel and the dan­ger posed by the virus. “There al­most cer­tainly is go­ing to be an uptick be­cause of what has hap­pened with the travel,” Dr Fauci told CNN’s State of the Union.</p>
    <p>Travel sur­round­ing last Thurs­day’s Thanks­giv­ing hol­i­day made last week the busiest week in US air­ports since the pan­demic be­gan. “We may see a surge upon a surge” in two or three weeks, Dr Fauci said. “We don’t want to frighten peo­ple, but that’s the re­al­ity.”</p>
    <p>The trend is omi­nous, Dr Fauci and other gov­ern­ment sci­en­tists said, with the Christ­mas hol­i­days soon bring­ing more travel and fam­ily gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>Dr Deb­o­rah Birx, White House coro­n­avirus re­sponse co­or­di­na­tor, noted a surge in Covid-19 af­ter a hol­i­day week­end in May. “Now we’re en­ter­ing this post-Thanks­giv­ing surge with three, four and 10 times as much dis­ease across the coun­try,” she told CBS’s “Face the Na­tion.” “We are deeply wor­ried.”</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Moderna Inc said it will ap­ply for US and Euro­pean emer­gency au­tho­ri­sa­tion for its vac­cine af­ter full re­sults from a late-stage study showed it was 94.1 per cent ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>The fil­ing sets Moderna’s prod­uct up to be the se­cond vac­cine likely to re­ceive US emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion this year fol­low­ing a shot de­vel­oped by Pfizer and BioNTech. Moderna said it was on track to have about 20 mil­lion doses of its vac­cine ready to ship in the US by the end of this year.</p>
