        A11 THE STRAITS TIMES TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 2020 | | | BROUGHT TO YOU BY The Four of Ladders Progressiv­e Wage Model Learn how PWM helps our essential service workers to upskill and benefit from higher wages and better work prospects The Progressiv­e Wage Model (PWM) provides a clear career progressio­n pathway, enabling our workers to earn with as they become Better Wages Better Work Prospects Better Skilled and More Productive. W hen Mr Rajasegara­n became a security officer in 2000, he didn’t expect to stay in the sector beyond one to two years. Since then, not only has he stayed on, but he has also carved out a meaningful career for himself — in spite of initial opposition from family and friends.
“They said that my career choice was ‘a lazy person’s job’,” he said.
Such biased views stem from misconcept­ions and ignorance about the security profession, he said. The 45-year-old went on to explain that working in the security line is more than just sitting in a guardhouse and taking down car plate numbers.
“You’re the first point of contact for anyone who visits the property. You have to be sharp, observant and a customeror­iented person,” said Mr Rajasegara­n, who cuts a tall, towering figure from afar. Up close, his disarming smile makes visitors feel comfortabl­e and welcome, even though he is on constant alert to potential threats.
He took a basic security course when he first joined the sector as a security officer for factory and commercial buildings. He later went on to complete on bigger responsibi­lities.
“My boss told me not to be scared of aiming higher just because I was worried about making mistakes. He said: ‘You have the talent, the experience, just go higher — slow and steady’, and I trusted him,” he said. more training courses as he progressed in his career. As a senior security supervisor, he now supervises a team of 12 security officers at a data centre.
While soft skills like leadership and negotiatio­n can be picked up on the job, his employer’s structured training and upskilling programme has allowed him to deepen his knowledge and stay up to date on the latest developmen­ts in the industry. He recently completed the 16-hour Recognise Terrorist Threats course as part of the skills ladder of the Progressiv­e Wage Model (PWM).
Introduced in 2014, the PWM aims to raise the wages of workers in selected sectors through skills upgrading and improvemen­ts in productivi­ty and is currently mandated in the cleaning, security, and landscapin­g sectors. It specifies starting wages for workers according to their skill and experience levels, so workers can get higher wages as they upgrade their skills and move up the career ladder.
Mr Rajasegara­n is among the 36,000 security officers, 40,000 cleaners and 3,000 landscape maintenanc­e workers who have benefitted from the PWM since its inception.
It is not easy juggling work and studies, said the father of two, but he sees the courses he has attended so far as stepping stones for career and skills progressio­n. “Wherever the limit is, that’s where I want to go,” he said. Mr Rosli is thrilled at being able to operate various machinerie­s that help raise the operationa­l efficiency and productivi­ty of his cleaners.
“Whenever there is a new machine in the market, I want to learn how to use it, find out how effective it can be in our line of work and see if it can help our team,” he said.
Having stretched his abilities and gained confidence in his new role, Mr Rosli has now set his sights on becoming an operations executive or an operations manager.
“I’m still learning to be a better supervisor and it’ll take two to four years before I can further upgrade myself for that role,” said the father of two daughters. “But if there is a chance, I will always take it.” Mr Chan is a landscape technician who enjoys full autonomy over the care of the plants at the condominiu­m where he works. Thriving in a second career residents frequently use.
Even though he was originally assigned to the property for only a month, the condominiu­m’s management council was so happy with his work that they requested for him to stay on.
“As a landscape technician, I believe the plants that I care for will always reward my hard work,” said Mr Chan, a father of two. “Even the residents say that there has been a big change in their living environmen­t. The plants are thriving and it looks like a lush paradise now.”
Whether driven by ambition, encouragem­ent from their employers or passion, Mr Rajasegara­n, Mr Rosli and Mr Chan have all built a sustainabl­e career for themselves in their respective sectors, and continue to inspire others to do the same.
Like how his boss used to motivate him, Mr Rosli now encourages his two assistants to upskill the same way he did: one small step at a time.
For Mr Rajasegara­n, his story has helped counter stereotype­s about jobs in the security sector. “Even my fatherin-law is asking me if he can join the company,” he said with a laugh. While continuous training helped Mr Rajasegara­n and Mr Rosli move up the skills ladder, landscape technician Chan Tuck Hon turned to relevant courses to facilitate a career switch two years ago.
An avid plant lover, he decided it was time to pursue what he has always enjoyed — tending to plants and flowers and being surrounded by lush greenery daily. He quit his job in the transport sector and took courses to equip himself with the skills needed to become a certified landscape maintenanc­e employee.
He was given many opportunit­ies to learn more about and care for plants in the nursery, and also participat­ed in events like the Singapore Garden Festival. Over time, Mr Chan gained experience in the field and supplement­ed gaps in his knowledge by completing a total of 10 courses over two years. These include certificat­ions for working at height and the use of electric tools in landscapin­g.
The 52-year-old is now a landscape technician at a condominiu­m where he enjoys full autonomy over the care of the plants. Instead of using pesticides, he opts to manually remove pests in the playground and other spaces where Mr Rosli is a cleaning supervisor who leads a team of 26 cleaners. They tap on technology to help ease their workload. Today, Mr Rosli is a cleaning supervisor who leads a team of 26 cleaners. To keep tenants, visitors and themselves safe during the pandemic, his team is asked to increase the cleaning frequency and follows strict and rigorous cleaning standards such as ensuring that hightouch surfaces are cleaned every two hours.
Fortunatel­y, Mr Rosli and his team are able to tap on technology to help ease their workload. Having completed a course in operating cleaning robots, he is able to use these robots to clean and disinfect large spaces with heavy footfall such as lobby areas, thereby reducing the team’s manual workload and allowing his team to focus on other tasks including the wiping down of high-touch surfaces. Seizing opportunit­ies to upskill Like Mr Rajasegara­n, 48-year-old Rosli Messdari takes great pride in his job. A part-time cleaner before joining the cleaning industry full-time five years ago, Mr Rosli has always been a reliable and diligent worker.
Recognisin­g his good performanc­e and seeing the potential in him, his employer encouraged him to pursue certificat­ions related to his job. At first, Mr Rosli was apprehensi­ve about taking Mr Rajasegara­n was recently promoted to senior security supervisor and currently supervises a team of 12 security officers at a data centre.
