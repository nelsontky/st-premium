        life motoring C8 THE STRAITS TIMES SATURDAY, AUGUST 1, 2020 | | | The BMW F900 XR is equipped with the latest electronic aids, which are usually found on bigger and pricier motorcycle­s The BMW F900 XR has Bluetooth connectivi­ty, keyless ignition, quickshift system and LED headlights which light up corners during a turn. Zaihan Mohamed Yusof Despite its medium-sized engine, the 2020 BMW F900 XR makes you feel like a fighter pilot.
When you attack a bend, its colourful TFT instrument­ation shows you braking G-forces. Downshifti­ng on its quickshift­er induces that sweet auto-blip grunt as you tip the handlebars to make a turn.
In mid-corner, the dashboard displays the percentage of traction control as well as your real-time maximum lean angle.
As you accelerate out of a bend and see the rev needle sweep towards its 10,000rpm ceiling, a gear shift indicator lights up, urging you to kick up a gear.
It is an exhilarati­ng bike, even if the speedomete­r reads only 75kmh.
The 900 XR’s technologi­es are usually found on bigger and pricier motorcycle­s. By putting them in a ST PHOTO: ALPHONSUS CHERN Renault unveils electric Zoe Van Renault has made a goods vehicle version of its electric Zoe micromini.
The Zoe Van (left) has a claimed range of 392.5km, uses the same 52kWh battery pack and 80kW R110 electric motor as the electric Zoe, and offers up to 1,000 litres of load space behind the front seats. BMW aims to cut emissions by 80 per cent by 2030 The main lever for this is production, which generates around 90 per cent of the company’s emissions. In addition to sourcing 100 per cent green power as of this year, BMW will systematic­ally invest in optimising its energy efficiency.
The company will drive further expansion of renewable energy sources at its plants worldwide, including the use of green hydrogen. BMW is pressing on with its environmen­tal goals. Its chairman Oliver Zipse announced this week that the company aims to reduce its emissions by 80 per cent from 2019 levels by 2030, after having already lowered emissions per vehicle produced by more than 70 per cent since 2006.

5.1 seconds Peugeot, Fiat-Chrysler merger named Stellantis Looking for a big and beefy car? Check out the new Mini Countryman John Cooper Works (above). With 306hp and 450Nm, Mini’s largest model has vroom to go with room. It gets to 100kmh in just 5.1 seconds.
With the heightened performanc­e, the rarefied Countryman gets a new grille, larger tailpipes, LED headlamps and a 5-inch digital dash.

As an option, the car can be equipped with an adaptive chassis. Peugeot and Fiat-Chrysler have created a new name for their merged entity: Stellantis.

Stellantis says it will combine “the scale of a truly global business with an exceptiona­l breadth and depth of talent, know-how and resource capable of providing the sustainabl­e mobility solutions for the coming decades”.
The French-Italian-American entity will use the new name “at the group level, as a corporate brand”. The next step, its adds, will be coming up with a logo. to Electric Porsche Taycan available now The Porsche Taycan has arrived, with prices posted from $485,988 for the 4S (above), $623,988 for the Turbo and $767,988 for the Turbo S.
