    <p>LIMA • Peru­vian govern­ment of­fi­cials con­demned the own­ers of a night­club af­ter at least 13 peo­ple were crushed to death or as­phyx­i­ated as par­ty­go­ers tried to flee a party raided by po­lice be­cause it vi­o­lated coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>At least six were in­jured, in­clud­ing three po­lice of­fi­cers, as around 120 peo­ple tried to es­cape the il­le­gal birth­day party at the Thomas Resto­bar club in Lima’s Los Olivos district on Satur­day night when po­lice ar­rived to break up the event, which neigh­bours had re­ported, na­tional po­lice and govern­ment of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>“Faced with the po­lice op­er­a­tion, which did not use any type of weapon or tear gas, those at­tend­ing the party tried to es­cape through the sin­gle exit, tram­pling over one an­other and get­ting trapped in the stair­way,” the In­te­rior Min­istry said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, some who were at the party and oth­ers liv­ing near the night­club dis­puted the min­istry’s ver­sion of events. One lo­cal res­i­dent told RPP ra­dio: “It ap­pears that po­lice en­tered and threw tear gas can­is­ters at them, and boxed them in.”</p>
    <p>Lo­cal me­dia re­ported that the vic­tims were in their 20s.</p>
    <p>Women’s Min­is­ter Rosario Sasi­eta said she was out­raged. “It should never have hap­pened. We are in a pan­demic, in a health emer­gency. I am call­ing for the max­i­mum pun­ish­ment pos­si­ble for the night­club own­ers,” she told RPP.</p>
    <p>“Know­ing that there is a health emer­gency, know­ing that not even at home you can meet with rel­a­tives who do not live there, you have the ir­re­spon­si­bil­ity of open­ing a place for 120 peo­ple to en­ter?”</p>
    <p>The In­te­rior Min­istry said 23 peo­ple had been de­tained and that the au­thor­i­ties are try­ing to iden­tify the or­gan­is­ers and the own­ers of the premises.</p>
    <p>Peru has recorded a to­tal of 585,236 coro­n­avirus cases as at Satur­day, dou­ble the num­ber re­ported on July 2, while the known death toll has risen to 27,453.</p>
    <p>A night-time cur­few has been in place since March 16, while bor­ders are closed and school classes have been sus­pended for the rest of the year.</p>
