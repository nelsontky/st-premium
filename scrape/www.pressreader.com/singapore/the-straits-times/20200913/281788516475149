    <p>MED­FORD (Ore­gon) • A Mex­i­can-Amer­i­can fam­ily de­scribed hav­ing to evac­u­ate the Bear Creek mo­bile home park 8km south of Med­ford, Ore­gon, as flocks of birds flew from ad­vanc­ing flames and sparks be­gan to rain down on their house.</p>
    <p>Ms Beatriz Gomez Bolanos told her four chil­dren to close their eyes while fires raged on both sides of their car as they made their es­cape. “Ev­ery­thing is gone. We have to start again from noth­ing, but we are alive,” the 41-year-old wo­man told Reuters by phone.</p>
    <p>They were lucky to es­cape with their lives as the wild­fires that tore through three West Coast states in the US have claimed more than 20 lives since erupt­ing last month.</p>
    <p>Over in Phoenix, Ore­gon, Mr Matt Man­son stared at the razed skeleton of his pick-up truck on Fri­day, which sat on a black­ened drive­way in front of a smoul­der­ing pile of rub­ble that once was his house. Like other res­i­dents in the small agri­cul­tural town in Ore­gon, Mr Man­son was in shock as he re­turned to his neigh­bour­hood and saw how fast the wild­fire had en­gulfed his home and up­ended his life.</p>
    <p>“The fire melted the mo­tor right out of my truck – it drained down the drive­way,” said the 43-year old con­struc­tion worker. “I lost ev­ery­thing. I lost all my tools. My truck. I can’t work. I lost US$30,000 (S$41,000) worth of guitars. All gone.”</p>
    <p>Mr Man­son, who now owns only a back­pack with a change of clothes, strug­gled to find the words to de­scribe how the fire had ravaged the town that sits near the green Siskiyou Moun­tains, about 337km south of Port­land. Trees lin­ing his street were now just black­ened, skele­tal re­mains.</p>
    <p>“It looks like a war just hap­pened here,” he said.</p>
    <p>In Phoenix, the smoke was still thick in the air as many of its 4,600 res­i­dents tried to grasp the ex­tent of the dam­age.</p>
    <p>Ms Doris Peter­son, 85, said she only had time to grab Toby, her 12-year-old Chi­huahua, when she and her hus­band, Richard, fled af­ter po­lice banged on their door on Tues­day about noon and told them they had just min­utes to get out. They spent five hours in bumper-to-bumper traf­fic be­fore find­ing a ho­tel room in Grants Pass, Ore­gon.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, she and her hus­band sat in their car at a baseball field just north of Phoenix, wait­ing to be es­corted into their neigh­bour­hood by po­lice.</p>
    <p>She was brac­ing her­self for the worst, but still hoped for a mir­a­cle. “I called my land­line phone – and the an­swer­ing ma­chine picked up!” she said. “My next door neigh­bour’s will not pick up. Maybe our house sur­vived.”</p>
