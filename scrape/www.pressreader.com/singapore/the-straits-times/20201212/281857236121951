    <p>A pro-China ca­ble TV sta­tion in Tai­wan was taken off the air yes­ter­day af­ter the me­dia reg­u­la­tor found it had failed to ad­dress find­ings of bias and dis­in­for­ma­tion, and de­clined to re­new its li­cence.</p>
    <p>Chung T’ien Tele­vi­sion’s (CTi) li­cence ex­pired yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Prior to go­ing off-air, CTi – one of Tai­wan’s most-watched ca­ble news sta­tions – put out a 42-hour live broad­cast of its an­chors and hosts chat­ting about their ex­pe­ri­ences work­ing for the sta­tion, and its 26 years of broad­cast his­tory.</p>
    <p>CTi is owned by Want Want China Times Me­dia Group, which also owns pro-China news­pa­per The China Times and snack man­u­fac­turer Want Want.</p>
    <p>Want Want’s man­age­ment is known for be­ing crit­i­cal of Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen’s pro-in­de­pen­dence Demo­cratic Pro­gres­sive Party (DPP), and the com­pa­ny­owned news out­lets pro­duce cov­er­age that leans to­wards China.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan’s Na­tional Com­mu­ni­ca­tions Com­mis­sion (NCC) an­nounced on Nov 18 that it had unan­i­mously de­cided not to re­new CTi’s broad­cast li­cence, in ef­fect shut­ting it down.</p>
    <p>NCC chair­man Chen Yaw­shyang said CTi had vi­o­lated broad­cast reg­u­la­tions re­peat­edly, with viewer com­plaints to the com­mis­sion ris­ing in the past three years.</p>
    <p>Last year alone, CTi was the sub­ject of more than 960 pub­lic com­plaints to the reg­u­la­tor, or about 30 per cent of all com­plaints about TV pro­gram­ming, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Chen said Want Want chair­man Tsai Eng-meng had med­dled in the sta­tion’s news pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Tsai has long been an ad­vo­cate for Tai­wan’s uni­fi­ca­tion with China. He is the is­land’s sec­on­drich­est man with a for­tune of US$5.6 bil­lion (S$7.6 bil­lion), af­ter Fox­conn founder Terry Gou with US$6.1 bil­lion, based on the Bloomberg Bil­lion­aires In­dex.</p>
    <p>CTi’s con­tent can still stream on on­line plat­forms like YouTube, said the NCC.</p>
    <p>The sta­tion re­ceived much pub­lic at­ten­tion in the weeks lead­ing up to Tai­wan’s presidenti­al elec­tion on Jan 11, when it ded­i­cated much of its cov­er­age to laud­ing the China-friendly can­di­date Han Kuo-yu. It ze­roed in on de­tails like his de­meanour, the way he dressed and the jokes he made.</p>
    <p>NCC’s de­ci­sion re­gard­ing CTi may be the most se­vere penalty a lo­cal me­dia out­let has re­ceived be­cause of its ties with China, but it is not the first time that “red me­dia”, or China-lean­ing me­dia, has made head­lines. In June last year, more than 100,000 peo­ple marched in Taipei to protest against “red me­dia”. Among them were DPP and third-party law­mak­ers as well as politi­cians, pro­fes­sors and In­ter­net in­flu­encers.</p>
    <p>The protest re­sulted in dis­cus­sions in Par­lia­ment the fol­low­ing week, when DPP law­mak­ers pro­posed amend­ing laws gov­ern­ing cross-strait re­la­tions and me­dia laws to pre­vent China from med­dling in lo­cal news pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>CTi has hit back, say­ing NCC’s move was po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated.</p>
    <p>A week af­ter NCC’s de­ci­sion, CTi filed for an in­junc­tion but this was re­jected by the court. The sta­tion said on Mon­day that it will be fil­ing an ap­peal, but as of yes­ter­day, no ap­peal had been filed.</p>
    <p>The sta­tion re­ceived much pub­lic at­ten­tion in the weeks lead­ing up to Tai­wan’s presidenti­al elec­tion on</p>
    <p>Jan 11, when it ded­i­cated much of its cov­er­age laud­ing the China-friendly can­di­date Han Kuo-yu (above). It ze­roed in on de­tails like his de­meanour and the jokes he made.</p>
