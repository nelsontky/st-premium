    <p>DHAKA • A sus­pected gas pipe­line ex­plo­sion at a mosque in Bangladesh killed 17 peo­ple and in­jured dozens as wor­ship­pers were about to end their prayers, of­fi­cials said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The blast, which fire ser­vice of­fi­cials sus­pect was caused by a leak from a gas pipe­line, oc­curred on Fri­day night at a mosque in Narayan­ganj dis­trict, just out­side the cap­i­tal Dhaka.</p>
    <p>At least 37 peo­ple were rushed to Dhaka’s spe­cial­ist burn and plas­tic surgery hos­pi­tal, most of them with se­vere burns, doc­tors said.</p>
    <p>Sev­en­teen peo­ple, in­clud­ing a child, died af­ter they sus­tained burn in­juries, said burn unit co­or­di­na­tor Sa­manta Lal Sen.</p>
    <p>The death toll could rise fur­ther as many of the in­jured were in crit­i­cal con­di­tion, he said.</p>
    <p>“I saw smoke was belch­ing out of the mosque af­ter the sud­den ex­plo­sion with a big bang and peo­ple were scream­ing. Some were rolling on the street as they tried to put out the flames on their bod­ies,” said lo­cal res­i­dent Mo­ham­mad Ratan.</p>
    <p>Fire of­fi­cials said gas that ac­cu­mu­lated from a leak in a pipe­line run­ning un­der­neath the mosque likely trig­gered the ex­plo­sion.</p>
    <p>“We pri­mar­ily sus­pect that gas leaked from the pipe­line and ac­cu­mu­lated inside since the win­dows were closed. The ex­plo­sion was prob­a­bly trig­gered due to sparks when the air-con­di­tion­ers were turned on,” said se­nior fire ser­vice of­fi­cial Ab­dul­lah Al Are­fin.</p>
    <p>The author­i­ties have launched an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Lax reg­u­la­tions and poor en­force­ment are of­ten blamed for do­mes­tic and in­dus­trial fires in Bangladesh.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary last year, an in­ferno in a cen­turies-old neigh­bour­hood in Dhaka killed 71 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>A month later, 25 peo­ple were killed when fire broke out in a 22-storey com­mer­cial build­ing in an up­scale area of the cap­i­tal.</p>
