    <p>Va­len­cia did not sign any play­ers in the trans­fer win­dow due to a €100 mil­lion (S$159.9 mil­lion) fall in rev­enue as a re­sult of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, club pres­i­dent Anil Murthy has said, adding that spend­ing be­yond their means would have been ir­re­spon­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Sup­port­ers and for­mer play­ers have rounded on the La Liga club’s hi­er­ar­chy af­ter they failed to bring in any new sign­ings be­fore the win­dow shut on Mon­day, de­spite let­ting eight key squad mem­bers leave in the close sea­son.</p>
    <p>“We be­gan this sea­son with a very dif­fi­cult chal­lenge, al­most im­pos­si­ble,” Sin­ga­porean Murthy told the club web­site on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“We had to adapt from hav­ing €200 mil­lion in rev­enue to €100 mil­lion and we had two clear ob­jec­tives, to re­duce the cost of the squad to solve the prob­lem (of the drop in in­come) and strengthen the team at the same time.</p>
    <p>“In the end, we couldn’t re­duce the cost of the squad enough and with­out achiev­ing that first ob­jec­tive, it was im­pos­si­ble to in­crease the cost of our squad.”</p>
    <p>Like ev­ery ma­jor sport­ing com­pe­ti­tion, La Liga faced huge dis­rup­tion due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, paus­ing for three months mid-sea­son be­fore com­plet­ing the fi­nal rounds of fix­tures with­out fans, which hit in­come from ticket sales and mer­chan­dise.</p>
    <p>Va­len­cia, who reached the Cham­pi­ons League last 16 but fin­ished ninth in the Span­ish top flight last sea­son, have taken seven points from their first five games of the new cam­paign to sit eighth.</p>
    <p>Coach Javi Gracia had re­cently spo­ken out about the club’s lack of ac­tiv­ity in the trans­fer mar­ket and ac­cord­ing to wide­spread re­ports in the Span­ish me­dia, he is con­sid­er­ing re­sign­ing due to the fail­ure to bol­ster the squad.</p>
    <p>“I un­der­stand the frus­tra­tion... we all wanted the same thing, to strengthen the team and raise its level but we weren’t able to do that,” added Murthy. “We have to be re­spon­si­ble in the face of this sit­u­a­tion be­cause that’s what this club de­serves.”</p>
