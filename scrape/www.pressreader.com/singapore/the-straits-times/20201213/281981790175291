    <p>A col­lec­tion of 50 es­says on Sin­ga­pore’s suc­cess story bagged the top prize for English books for adults at the Pop­u­lar Read­ers’ Choice Awards 2020 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The book, ti­tled Fifty Se­crets Of Sin­ga­pore’s Suc­cess, was edited by Pro­fes­sor Tommy Koh, a vet­eran diplo­mat who is Am­bas­sador-at-Large at the Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>It fea­tures con­tri­bu­tions from well-known fig­ures such as the Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board’s for­mer ex­ec­u­tive chair­man Philip Yeo and Sin­ga­pore’s first and long­est-serv­ing Chief of De­fence Force Win­ston Choo.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times vet­eran jour­nal­ists Vikram Khanna, Christo­pher Tan and San­dra Davie also con­trib­uted es­says to the book, which was pub­lished by Straits Times Press (ST Press).</p>
    <p>Prof Koh thanked Pop­u­lar book­store for hold­ing the an­nual com­pe­ti­tion, which is now in its ninth year, and its “long record of pro­mot­ing read­ing and Sin­ga­pore’s writ­ers”.</p>
    <p>Its prize pre­sen­ta­tion cer­e­mony was held vir­tu­ally this year.</p>
    <p>“Win­ning this award is a dream come true. It has been my as­pi­ra­tion to write or edit a book which res­onates with our read­ers,” he said.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond- and third-place win­ners in the Adult English Books Cat­e­gory are also books pub­lished by ST Press.</p>
    <p>For­mer ST In­vest ed­i­tor Lorna Tan, who is now head of fi­nan­cial plan­ning lit­er­acy at DBS Bank, took sec­ond place with her book Money Smart: Own Your Fi­nan­cial Des­tiny.</p>
    <p>“The Covid-19 pan­demic has been a wake-up call for us to put in place a ro­bust fi­nan­cial plan to bet­ter man­age our money mat­ters,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Money Smart will em­power more peo­ple to make in­formed de­ci­sions to iden­tify and close their money gaps, and look out for suit­able op­por­tu­ni­ties to achieve fi­nan­cial well­ness. Thank you for your votes.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the sec­ond edi­tion of for­mer Cab­i­net min­is­ter S. Jayaku­mar’s book Diplo­macy: A Sin­ga­pore Ex­pe­ri­ence came in third.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Jayaku­mar con­grat­u­lated Prof Koh and Ms Tan for their wins and added that he was “de­lighted to be among their com­pany”.</p>
    <p>He thanked ST Press for pub­lish­ing his book and the read­ers who voted for it.</p>
    <p>“I am cheered and en­cour­aged that my book on weighty top­ics such as for­eign re­la­tions and diplo­macy com­manded so much in­ter­est and sup­port,” he said.</p>
    <p>All the ti­tles nom­i­nated for the awards can be bought dur­ing the BookFest@Sin­ga­pore 2020 event, which is be­ing held at all Pop­u­lar out­lets till next Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The three ST Press books are also on sale at web­site www.stbooks.sg and other ma­jor book re­tail­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan Ooi Boon, su­per­vis­ing ed­i­tor for ST Press, said: “We are very hum­bled and heart­ened by the strong sup­port for our books be­cause 2020 is cer­tainly a very chal­leng­ing year for not just us but also for ev­ery busi­ness and in­di­vid­ual.</p>
    <p>“On be­half of all our au­thors, we’d like to ex­press our deep­est grat­i­tude to all read­ers for their sup­port and we will cer­tainly work harder to serve them bet­ter in the com­ing year.”</p>
    <p>Other win­ners in­cluded Se­crets Of Sin­ga­pore: Na­tional Gallery by Cather­ine Nadira Tan, which took first place in the cat­e­gory for English books for chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Com­ing in sec­ond in the same cat­e­gory was A.J. Low’s Sher­lock Sam And The Bur­gled Book In Kam­pong Glam while Vi­vian Teo’s My BFF Is An Alien clinched the third spot.</p>
    <p>The three chil­dren’s books were all pub­lished by Epi­gram Books.</p>
