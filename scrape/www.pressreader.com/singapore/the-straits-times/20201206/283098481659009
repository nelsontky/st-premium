    <p>An­other day, an­other study sug­gest­ing women are bad with money.</p>
    <p>A UBS Global Wealth Man­age­ment sur­vey of over 1,800 mar­ried men and women re­cently found that nearly half of the women – led by mil­len­ni­als – de­fer ma­jor fi­nan­cial and in­vest­ment de­ci­sions to their spouses.</p>
    <p>The wives cited rea­sons for this such as not want­ing to ar­gue, hav­ing “no idea where to be­gin” and believ­ing their spouses are bet­ter with money.</p>
    <p>Close to 60 per cent said sim­ply that they want to be “taken care of”.</p>
    <p>While the sam­ple of women in the study is nar­row – the peo­ple sur­veyed were wealthy, with the lower end hav­ing at least US$250,000 (S$333,000) in in­vestable as­sets – the fi­nan­cial im­bal­ance in mar­riage that the find­ings un­der­score is hardly an anom­aly.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial avoid­ance is a re­cur­ring nar­ra­tive among women and wives, of­ten passed down from pre­vi­ous gen­er­a­tions. Now, in the pan­demic, with more women los­ing their jobs or drop­ping out of the work­force than men, tra­di­tional gen­der roles in mar­riage are in­creas­ingly at play, in­clud­ing de­fer­ring sig­nif­i­cant fi­nan­cial de­ci­sions to hus­bands.</p>
    <p>We al­ready know the risks in­her­ent to bury­ing your head in the sand – things like get­ting a false sense of se­cu­rity, scram­bling to piece to­gether your fi­nances when a spouse is no longer around or worse, and feel­ing fi­nan­cially trapped in a bad re­la­tion­ship. So let’s dis­cuss tan­gi­ble so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>If you find your­self out of touch with your fi­nances, here are steps to help you level the play­ing field with your part­ner. In the end, the goal is to ar­rive at a place where you feel like an ac­tive par­tic­i­pant in the de­ci­sions that im­pact your fi­nan­cial life to­gether.</p>
    <p>GO TO THE DARK PLACE</p>
    <p>For just a mo­ment imag­ine your­self sud­denly left alone need­ing to man­age your fi­nances in­de­pen­dently, af­ter years of be­ing in the dark. Or con­sider want­ing out of your re­la­tion­ship, with no idea about the cur­rent bal­ances in your joint bro­ker­age ac­count, or even how to ac­cess them, to en­sure as­sets get di­vided fairly.</p>
    <p>If, like some of the women in this study, you worry about not know­ing where to be­gin to­day, think about how lost you would be later if and when you re­ally need to man­age your in­vest­ments, life in­sur­ance and will with your part­ner out of the pic­ture.</p>
    <p>The facts are that women tend to live longer and are more likely to be alone in old age. They of­ten face higher long-term care costs.</p>
    <p>This ex­er­cise is not meant to add anx­i­ety to your life, but to pro­vide the wake-up call nec­es­sary to un­der­stand the risk that comes with walk­ing through your fi­nan­cial life blind­folded. Face the “what ifs” and you might be mo­ti­vated to em­brace your fi­nances.</p>
    <p>GET BACK IN THE GAME</p>
    <p>This will re­quire a con­ver­sa­tion with your part­ner, but it does not have to be hard.</p>
    <p>Try some­thing to the ef­fect of: “I’ve been think­ing, and start­ing this week (or month), I’d like to be more in touch with our fi­nances. You’ve been do­ing a great job, but me tak­ing a back seat, we both know, is not ideal. It doesn’t help you or me when I’m not knowl­edge­able about things.”</p>
    <p>Your part­ner should un­der­stand and be open to it. If not, ex­plore why. In my ex­pe­ri­ence, a spouse’s re­sis­tance to fi­nan­cial trans­parency and co-pi­lot­ing big de­ci­sions can be an in­di­ca­tion of larger is­sues.</p>
    <p>I hope this goes smoothly, but bot­tom line: You shouldn’t feel like you need to get “per­mis­sion” to know how money is get­ting man­aged.</p>
    <p>START WITH AC­CESS AND TRANS­PARENCY</p>
    <p>Shar­ing a pass­word-pro­tected doc­u­ment that pro­vides a list of all user names and pass­words to your fi­nan­cial ac­counts is an easy first step that pro­motes equal ac­cess to your shared fi­nan­cial life. From there, use an on­line tool that can help you see all ac­count bal­ances and cash flow in one place. On your own time you can log in and re­view bal­ances and be­come more fa­mil­iar with the num­bers.</p>
    <p>MAKE WEEKLY STRIDES</p>
    <p>From here, ex­pand your knowl­edge. Ded­i­cate weekly time to touch­ing base with your part­ner un­til you feel caught up. Your in­vest­ments and longterm fi­nan­cial plan can be a lot to di­gest in one sit­ting, so pace your­self and com­mit to learn­ing some­thing new at each meet­ing.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the first week, you can fo­cus on re­tire­ment – specif­i­cally, your con­tri­bu­tions, in­vest­ment breakdown and ex­po­sure to risk. Week two can be about life in­sur­ance, fol­lowed by your will and then long-term care plan­ning.</p>
    <p>CON­SIDER A PRO</p>
    <p>Work­ing with a cer­ti­fied fi­nan­cial plan­ner (CFP) was in­stru­men­tal in the be­gin­ning of my own mar­riage be­cause it helped us cre­ate a fi­nan­cial road map, fill some in­sur­ance gaps and cre­ate an over­all sense of ac­count­abil­ity that we may not have had on our own.</p>
    <p>It was also help­ful to have an ob­jec­tive in­di­vid­ual in the room to give us highly qual­i­fied feed­back and ad­vice. If you are wor­ried about dis­agree­ments like some of the women sur­veyed, a good CFP can help calm the waters.</p>
