    <p>More peo­ple con­trib­uted to their re­tire­ment funds in the first nine months of this year, com­pared with the same pe­riod last year, said the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) Board yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It noted that more than 198,000 top-ups were made un­der the Re­tire­ment Sum Top­ping-Up scheme, amount­ing to $1.81 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>In com­par­i­son, t he nearly 148,000 top-ups made un­der the scheme be­tween Jan­uary and Septem­ber last year amounted to $1.47 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The Re­tire­ment Sum Top­pingUp scheme helps peo­ple to build their re­tire­ment sav­ings by con­tribut­ing to their Spe­cial Ac­count or Re­tire­ment Ac­count, or those of their loved ones.</p>
    <p>One-third of those who made top-ups in the first nine months of this year were first-timers, the board said.</p>
    <p>It added that the num­ber of first-timers younger than 35 rose by over 70 per cent com­pared with the pre­vi­ous year.</p>
    <p>“(This is) a sign that younger adults ap­pre­ci­ate the value of grow­ing their re­tire­ment sav­ings early with at­trac­tive in­ter­est in CPF,” the board added.</p>
    <p>It also noted that with­drawals from those aged 55 and older have de­clined, with the to­tal amount taken out shrink­ing by nearly 20 per cent.</p>
    <p>“It is en­cour­ag­ing to see CPF mem­bers place their trust in us by ei­ther choos­ing to keep their sav­ings or put in more money into their CPF ac­counts, even amid the Covid-19 pan­demic,” said Ms Tan Chui Leng, group direc­tor of the board’s Re­tire­ment In­come Group.</p>
    <p>“Such mem­bers can look for­ward to a stream of re­tire­ment pay­outs that they can count on even in un­cer­tain times.”</p>
    <p>Cash top-ups have to be made be­fore Dec 31 to re­ceive tax re­liefs of up to $14,000 in next year’s tax as­sess­ment.</p>
    <p>Top-ups can be made on­line, via the CPF web­site or the myCPF mobile app.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers are en­cour­aged to top up early to earn more in­ter­est, the board said.</p>
    <p>Num­ber of top-ups made un­der the Re­tire­ment Sum Top­ping-Up scheme, amount­ing to $1.81 bil­lion, in the first nine months of this year.</p>
