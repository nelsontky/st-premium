    <p>PARIS As early as Fe­bru­ary, with the global pan­demic spread­ing fast, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) is­sued a warn­ing about an “infodemic”, a wave of fake news and mis­in­for­ma­tion about the deadly new dis­ease on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Now with hopes hang­ing on Covid-19 vac­cines, the WHO and ex­perts are warn­ing those same phe­nom­ena may jeop­ar­dise roll­out of im­mu­ni­sa­tion pro­grammes meant to help end the suf­fer­ing.</p>
    <p>“The coronaviru­s dis­ease is the first pan­demic in his­tory in which tech­nol­ogy and so­cial me­dia are be­ing used on a mas­sive scale to keep peo­ple safe, in­formed, pro­duc­tive and con­nected,” the WHO said.</p>
    <p>“At the same time, the tech­nol­ogy we rely on to keep con­nected and in­formed is en­abling and am­pli­fy­ing an infodemic that con­tin­ues to un­der­mine the global re­sponse and jeop­ar­dises mea­sures to con­trol the pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>More than 1.4 mil­lion peo­ple have died since the pan­demic emerged in China late last year, but three de­vel­op­ers are al­ready ap­ply­ing for ap­proval for their vac­cines to be used as early as next month.</p>
    <p>Be­yond lo­gis­tics, though, gov­ern­ments must also con­tend with scep­ti­cism over vac­cines de­vel­oped with record speed at a time when so­cial me­dia has been both a tool for in­for­ma­tion and false­hood about the virus.</p>
    <p>Last month, a study from Cor­nell Univer­sity in the United States found US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has been the world’s big­gest driver of Covid-19 mis­in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>In April, he mused on the pos­si­bil­ity of us­ing dis­in­fec­tants in­side the body as a cure and also pro­moted un­proven treat­ments.</p>
    <p>The WHO said: “With­out the ap­pro­pri­ate trust and cor­rect in­for­ma­tion, di­ag­nos­tic tests go un­used, im­mu­ni­sa­tion cam­paigns (or cam­paigns to pro­mote ef­fec­tive vac­cines) will not meet their tar­gets, and the virus will con­tinue to thrive.”</p>
    <p>Out­landish claims by con­spir­acy the­o­rists that the pan­demic is a hoax mas­ter­minded by elites like Mi­crosoft co-founder Bill Gates to con­trol the pop­u­la­tion are al­ready mak­ing their rounds on so­cial me­dia. They also claimed that the vac­ci­na­tion pro­grammes are a shield to im­plant mi­cro­scopic chips in peo­ple so that they could be mon­i­tored.</p>
    <p>Dr Steven Wil­son, co-au­thor of So­cial Me­dia and Vac­cine Hes­i­tancy pub­lished in the Bri­tish Med­i­cal Jour­nal last month, said: “My fear is that will in­crease the num­ber of in­di­vid­u­als who are hes­i­tant about get­ting a vac­cine. Any vac­cine is only as ef­fec­tive as our ca­pac­ity to de­ploy it to a pop­u­la­tion.”</p>
