    <p>From bak­ing cook­ies and moon­cakes to do­ing mini walk­ing marathons, some 3,000 preschool­ers from Maple Bear worked hard last month to raise money for less for­tu­nate chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Their fundrais­ing ef­forts have bagged $107,777 for Make-A-Wish Foun­da­tion and Chil­dren’s Wish­ing Well, both char­i­ties for chil­dren and teenagers, an­nounced the Maple Bear pre-school chain in a re­lease last week. The an­nual fundraiser is or­gan­ised in Oc­to­ber, to co­in­cide with Chil­dren’s Day.</p>
    <p>This year’s edi­tion saw preschool­ers tak­ing part in a range of ac­tiv­i­ties at their own cen­tres, from bake sales and fundrais­ing car­ni­vals to mini walk­ing marathons, where par­ents do­nated $1 for ev­ery minute their chil­dren walked around a field.</p>
    <p>The kids walked side­ways and back­wards to keep their spir­its up.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive of Maple Bear Sin­ga­pore Patricia Koh said this year’s event has ex­ceeded ex­pec­ta­tions, as there were ini­tial con­cerns that peo­ple might not be gen­er­ous with their dona­tions amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>So­cial dis­tanc­ing rules also meant ac­tiv­i­ties had to be con­fined within each pre-school cen­tre, and the chil­dren could not gather to­gether for a ma­jor fundrais­ing event as they had done in past years, she said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the chil­dren, teach­ers and par­ents re­sponded well to the cause, said Mrs Koh. She added that the fundraiser serves to re­mind the pre-school­ers of the less for­tu­nate among them.</p>
    <p>“We want our chil­dren to see that there are other chil­dren out there who need more,” said Mrs Koh.</p>
    <p>“And even though they are very young – they’re only two to six years old – I think they do seem to un­der­stand that.”</p>
