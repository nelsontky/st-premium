    <p>Sin­ga­porean singer and ac­tor Huang Jinglun turned 37 yes­ter­day and took the chance to share some ex­cit­ing news: He is mar­ried with a baby boy on the way.</p>
    <p>He an­nounced the good news on his Instagram ac­count, post­ing a pic­ture of him­self and his preg­nant wife, as well as pic­tures of an ul­tra­sound scan and their wed­ding rings. Huang cap­tioned: “My birth­day this year is truly mean­ing­ful. For one thing, my favourite team (Liverpool) won the cham­pi­onship.”</p>
    <p>Thank­ing fans for their gifts and wishes, he added: “My best gift this year is that I am mar­ried and that I am go­ing to be a father soon.”</p>
    <p>Wish­ing that his son will “grow up hand­some”, the Tai­wan-based artist added that he would be re­leas­ing a mini-al­bum at the end of the month and that good things “come in threes”.</p>
    <p>Huang did not show his wife’s face in the im­ages or in­clude de­tails about her, but Tai­wanese me­dia have re­ported that she is 28 and not from the en­ter­tain­ment busi­ness.</p>
    <p>They were said to have been dat­ing for four years and mar­ried in May this year, with Tai­wanese ac­tor Kuo Chi-chien serv­ing as one of their wit­nesses, Tai­wan’s United Daily News re­ported.</p>
    <p>Fans left con­grat­u­la­tory mes­sages af­ter the news came out. One wrote: “Happy birth­day and con­grat­u­la­tions! I’m re­ally so happy for you!”</p>
    <p>Huang first found fame on Tai­wanese re­al­ity singing com­pe­ti­tion, One Mil­lion Star, in 2008. He signed on with Warner Mu­sic Tai­wan and re­leased his first solo al­bum, Jing’s Note, later that year.</p>
    <p>Huang has ap­peared in many tele­vi­sion se­ries, in­clud­ing the 2009 Tai­wanese com­edy, Momo Love, and has since shifted his fo­cus to tele­vi­sion pre­sent­ing, win­ning him Best Host In A Chil­dren’s Pro­gramme at the pres­ti­gious Golden Bell Awards in 2016.</p>
