    <p>The rental mar­ket ran hot and cold last month with HDB flats and pri­vate apart­ments record­ing their first monthly in­creases af­ter four months of de­cline, but leas­ings fell as the pan­demic con­tin­ued to im­pact travel and jobs.</p>
    <p>HDB rents rose 1.4 per cent last month from June, a big­ger rate of in­crease than the 0.4 per cent rise for pri­vate con­do­mini­ums and apart­ments, SRX data showed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>One pos­si­ble rea­son for the ro­bust lift in HDB rents was de­mand from Malaysian work­ers or their em­ploy­ers to lease flats given the Covid-19 bor­der re­stric­tions, said ERA Realty re­search and con­sul­tancy head Ni­cholas Mak.</p>
    <p>A re­cent eas­ing of these rules will al­low some of these work­ers to go to Malaysia to see their fam­i­lies, but as they would have to stay in Sin­ga­pore for at least 90 days be­fore re­turn­ing for home leave, they would still re­quire ac­com­mo­da­tion in Sin­ga­pore, said Mr Mak.</p>
    <p>The over­all rise for both pri­vate and HDB homes last month could also be due to some land­lords rais­ing ask­ing rents af­ter ob­serv­ing a sud­den surge in de­mand dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, said Ms Chris­tine Sun, head of re­search and con­sul­tancy at OrangeTee & Tie.</p>
    <p>She also noted that more ex­pa­tri­ates could be opt­ing for cheaper pri­vate hous­ing given job and pay un­cer­tain­ties. This “shift in de­mand” may have sent rents up for pri­vate units in the sub­urbs and city fringes, while rents for more lux­u­ri­ous homes in prime dis­tricts dipped for the fifth straight month.</p>
    <p>“We may ex­pect more ten­ants to con­tinue to opt for cheaper hous­ing op­tions as some may be fac­ing pay cuts or given smaller hous­ing pack­ages in the cur­rent macroe­co­nomic un­cer­tain­ties,” said Ms Sun.</p>
    <p>Over­all rents for pri­vate apart­ments were down 0.9 per cent from July last year and 17.5 per cent off their peak in Jan­uary 2013.</p>
    <p>Rents for HDB flats dipped 0.5 per cent from a year ear­lier and were 14.9 per cent lower than their peak in Au­gust 2013.</p>
    <p>Rental vol­umes, mean­while, shrank for both pri­vate and HDB flats last month.</p>
    <p>July leas­ings for pri­vate con­do­mini­ums and apart­ments fell 7.2 per cent from June to 3,880 units.</p>
    <p>This was 32.3 per cent lower than a year ear­lier and 22.8 per cent un­der the five-year av­er­age vol­ume for July.</p>
    <p>Vol­umes for HDB flats last month tum­bled 19.1 per cent from June to 1,435 units – 31.6 per cent lower than a year ear­lier and 25.7 per cent be­low the five-year av­er­age vol­ume for the month.</p>
    <p>Job losses among some ex­pa­tri­ates re­sulted in the con­trac­tion in leas­ing de­mand, said Mr Mak. This was il­lus­trated by the sharp 30 per cent or so year-on-year de­cline in leas­ing vol­ume in both the pri­vate and pub­lic hous­ing mar­kets last month.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun said fewer ex­pa­tri­ates have been com­ing to Sin­ga­pore in re­cent months, given bor­der re­stric­tions and stay-home notices for in­bound trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>Ris­ing un­em­ploy­ment, espe­cially in the tourism, hospi­tal­ity, avi­a­tion and ser­vice sec­tors, may also be af­fect­ing de­mand for HDB and pri­vate rental units, she added.</p>
    <p>Rental de­mand for more af­ford­able HDB flats, espe­cially those near in­dus­trial es­tates, is ex­pected to re­main healthy, said Mr Mak.</p>
