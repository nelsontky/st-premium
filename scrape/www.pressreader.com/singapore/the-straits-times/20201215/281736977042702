    <p>Five new coro­n­avirus cases were con­firmed yesterday, tak­ing Singapore’s to­tal to 58,325.</p>
    <p>All five were im­ported cases and had been placed on stay-home no­tice on ar­rival in Singapore, the Min­istry of Health said last night.</p>
    <p>The new cases com­prised four work per­mit hold­ers em­ployed in Singapore and one short-term visit pass holder.</p>
    <p>Three of the work per­mit hold­ers are In­done­sian women, aged be­tween 27 and 35, who trav­elled from In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing work per­mit holder is a 32-year-old woman who ar­rived from the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>The short-term visit pass holder is a 24-year-old man who re­turned from In­dia. He is en­rolled in a pri­vate ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tion in Singapore.</p>
    <p>All five cases were asymp­to­matic and were de­tected through proac­tive screen­ing and sur­veil­lance, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>They were tested while serv­ing their stay-home no­tice at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>There were no new com­mu­nity cases and none from the mi­grant work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries, the min­istry added. It also said the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with no new cases in the past week.</p>
    <p>With two cases dis­charged yesterday, 58,195 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 22 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 64 pa­tients are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Singapore has had 29 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
