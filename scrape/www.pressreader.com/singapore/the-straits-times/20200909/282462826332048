    <p>The true wire­less i n-ear head­phones market is get­ting bor­ing in de­sign. Th­ese days, re­gard­less of brand, you ex­pect to get two bul­bous ear­buds with a short or long stem and a pill-box charg­ing case.</p>
    <p>The Sam­sung Galaxy Buds Live bucks this trend. In fact, I am both amazed and puzzled when I un­box it and am greeted by two shiny “kid­ney beans”.</p>
    <p>The ear­buds come in black, white and bronze (ver­sion tested), with a match­ing charg­ing case that looks like a wed­ding ring box. The case has a USB-C charg­ing port and sup­ports wire­less charg­ing.</p>
    <p>The shiny touch-sen­si­tive outer side of the ear­buds, which looks rose gold from cer­tain an­gles, will melt the hearts of fash­ion­istas and turn some heads when you wear them.</p>
    <p>On the non-shiny in­ner side of each ear­bud are two charg­ing pins and a small grille. To wear the ear­buds, insert the grille end into your ears.</p>
    <p>With­out ear tips, I am wor­ried the ear­buds would not fit my ears. But they lock in nicely.</p>
    <p>Even when I try to dis­lodge them by shak­ing my head vig­or­ously, they stay snugly in place. They are also com­fort­able to wear for long pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>How­ever, they have a wa­ter-re­sis­tance rat­ing of only IPX2, which means they can­not with­stand a lot of sweat or even pass­ing show­ers. So I will not rec­om­mend wear­ing them for work­outs.</p>
    <p>In each ear­bud is a 12mm dy­namic driver with a bass duct for en­hanc­ing lower-fre­quency sound and air vents to re­duce echoes. Three built-in mi­cro­phones help pick up your voice clearly. The Buds Live also fea­tures ac­tive noise can­cel­la­tion (ANC).</p>
    <p>While it can be paired with more than one de­vice, it does not sup­port Blue­tooth mul­ti­point. In other words, you have to man­u­ally switch from one paired de­vice to an­other.</p>
    <p>You can use the Galaxy Wear­able (An­droid) or Galaxy Buds (iOS) app to con­fig­ure the Buds Live – from se­lect­ing the equaliser (EQ) pre­set to cus­tomis­ing the tap con­trols.</p>
    <p>By de­fault, a sin­gle tap on ei­ther ear­bud pauses or plays a track, while a dou­ble tap skips a track and a triple tap re­turns to the pre­vi­ous track. A long press turns the ANC on or off. This con­trol scheme is more in­tu­itive than some true wire­less in-ear head­phones, which might need you to re­mem­ber which ear­bud to tap for cer­tain func­tions.</p>
    <p>I find my­self us­ing the Dy­namic EQ pre­set when lis­ten­ing to mu­sic. With this pre­set, the bass is punchy, with clear vo­cals and a re­laxed tre­ble. If you pre­fer a more bal­anced sound­scape, you can opt for the Nor­mal EQ pre­set.</p>
    <p>Call qual­ity is crys­tal clear – I can be heard loud and clear at the other end, whether I am us­ing my iPhone 11 Pro Max or a Sam­sung Galaxy Note20 Ul­tra.</p>
    <p>On the down­side, due to the rel­a­tively open de­sign of the Buds Live, the ANC is not as ef­fec­tive as that of a Sennheiser Mo­men­tum TW2 or a Sony WF-1000XM3, both of which form a seal to the ear canal with their ear tips.</p>
    <p>But the Buds Live does have a long bat­tery life – up to six hours of mu­sic play­back with ANC turned on. This is on a par with the WF-1000XM3 and bet­ter than the Ap­ple AirPods Pro, which lasts about 41/ hours.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>Not to men­tion, at $288, the Buds Live is much cheaper than both genre lead­ers – the WF-1000XM3 is priced at $349 and the AirPods Pro at $379.</p>
