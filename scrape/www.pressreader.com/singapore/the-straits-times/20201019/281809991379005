    <p>WELLINGTON • Ms Jacinda Ardern’s land­slide elec­tion win gives her a man­date for the trans­for­ma­tional change she has been promis­ing New Zealand for three years, but the Covid-19 pan­demic may limit what she can do.</p>
    <p>The Prime Min­is­ter’s sig­na­ture achieve­ment in all but elim­i­nat­ing the coro­n­avirus from the Pa­cific is­land na­tion through strict lock­downs pro­pelled her to vic­tory last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>But this ap­proach may also hin­der the re­cov­ery New Zealan­ders are hop­ing for and the pro­gres­sive poli­cies cham­pi­oned by Ms Ardern.</p>
    <p>The gen­eral elec­tion was “tec­tonic” and with this man­date, Ms Ardern “needs to de­liver”, said pro­fes­sor of pol­i­tics Richard Shaw of Massey Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Early yes­ter­day, hours af­ter de­liv­er­ing the big­gest win in half a cen­tury for her cen­tre-left Labour Party, Ms Ardern was deal­ing with the pan­demic again as a new in­fec­tion sprang up, end­ing a two-week coro­n­avirus-free run.</p>
    <p>New Zealand had been free of com­mu­nity cases for more than 100 days un­til new in­fec­tions emerged in Auck­land in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>The new case is un­likely to spread fur­ther, health of­fi­cials said, but it high­lighted the risk the na­tion of five mil­lion faces as it pours its ef­forts into keep­ing the rag­ing pan­demic off its shores.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern has as­signed NZ$62 bil­lion (S$55.7 bil­lion) to Covid-19 re­cov­ery this year, most of it on wage sub­si­dies to avoid mas­sive job losses.</p>
    <p>She de­ployed busi­ness loans and rent freezes, and eased some tax re­quire­ments. But with no plans for ma­jor tax re­form and rev­enue shrink­ing from tourism and im­mi­gra­tion, two of New Zealand’s top money gen­er­a­tors, there are ques­tions over how the gov­ern­ment can achieve its so­cial and eco­nomic goals.</p>
    <p>“There is not a huge pot of money avail­able out­side of the Covid re­sponse,” said Mr Brad Olsen, se­nior econ­o­mist at Wellington-based eco­nomic con­sul­tancy firm In­fo­met­rics.</p>
    <p>“So you do won­der what is­sues have to take pri­or­ity and how they can achieve trans­for­ma­tional change while also ramp­ing up the Covid-19 re­sponse.”</p>
    <p>With net core crown debt fore­cast at NZ$201 bil­lion, or 55 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) by 2024 – up from less than 20 per cent be­fore the pan­demic – Ms Ardern’s bor­row­ing op­tions are shrink­ing. New Zealand gov­ern­ments of all stripes have tra­di­tion­ally sought to keep debt be­low 20 per cent of GDP.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern, 40, trail­ing in opin­ion polls as late as Fe­bru­ary, saw Labour’s sup­port shoot up as New Zealan­ders ral­lied be­hind her “go hard, go early” ap­proach to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>But her strict lock­downs crip­pled the tourism-cen­tred econ­omy and hob­bled her ef­forts to tackle child poverty, home­less­ness, in­equal­ity and cli­mate change. Un­em­ploy­ment is ex­pected to dou­ble to about 8 per cent in the next two years.</p>
    <p>Vot­ers do not want the gov­ern­ment to cut spend­ing, Mr Olsen said.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern wants to build af­ford­able hous­ing, raise min­i­mum wages and spur thou­sands of jobs in en­vi­ron­ment-friendly projects.</p>
    <p>On is­sues like child poverty and home­less­ness, where New Zealand is one of the worst per­form­ers among de­vel­oped na­tions, Ms Ardern has launched schemes like free school lunches and sup­port for buy­ing first homes.</p>
    <p>She had ar­gued that it was im­pos­si­ble to meet these tar­gets in her first three-year term, ask­ing vot­ers for a full man­date to bring mean­ing­ful change.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter this re­sult, we have the man­date to ac­cel­er­ate our re­sponse and our re­cov­ery, and to­mor­row we start,” she promised vot­ers on Satur­day night.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern’s crit­ics, how­ever, have ques­tioned her abil­ity to tackle the eco­nomic cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“I feel very con­cerned for my coun­try,” op­po­si­tion Na­tional Party leader Ju­dith Collins said yes­ter­day, vow­ing to keep press­ing Ms Ardern on eco­nomic is­sues.</p>
    <p>Ms Collins had ar­gued that the cen­tre-right Na­tional was bet­ter placed to take New Zealand through this fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern’s big­gest suc­cess has been to draw New Zealan­ders closer with her brand of com­pas­sion­ate lead­er­ship at a time of deep un­cer­tainty, in con­trast to other po­lit­i­cal lead­ers around the world who were seen as po­lar­is­ing and di­vid­ing.</p>
    <p>She struck a sim­i­lar tone with sup­port­ers af­ter the vote, say­ing that in an in­creas­ingly po­larised world, New Zealand was show­ing it was united.</p>
    <p>“Elec­tions aren’t al­ways great at bring­ing peo­ple to­gether, but they also don’t need to tear one an­other apart,” she said.</p>
