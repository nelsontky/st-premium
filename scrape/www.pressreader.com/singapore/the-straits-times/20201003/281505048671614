    <p>While great power ri­valry be­tween the United States and China may be in­evitable, it does not have to be a zero-sum game, said Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat.</p>
    <p>Both coun­tries should abide by ex­ist­ing in­ter­na­tional norms and laws even as they com­pete for power and in­flu­ence, he said, adding that this is a means of strength­en­ing mu­tual trust and es­tab­lish­ing ap­pro­pri­ate dis­pute res­o­lu­tion mech­a­nisms.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with Chi­nese news­pa­per Lianhe Zaobao, which was pub­lished yes­ter­day, Mr Heng said the US-China re­la­tion­ship is the most im­por­tant set of bi­lat­eral ties in the world.</p>
    <p>Tense re­la­tions now, as the world bat­tles the Covid-19 pan­demic, will only re­sult in greater po­lar­i­sa­tion and dam­age, he added.</p>
    <p>China is a part of the re­gion and a fast-grow­ing world power, while the US has had a long­stand­ing pres­ence and sig­nif­i­cant in­ter­ests in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>And while the US is Sin­ga­pore’s largest for­eign in­vestor, China is Sin­ga­pore’s largest trad­ing part­ner, Mr Heng said, not­ing that many other coun­tries in the re­gion also have close ties with both pow­ers.</p>
    <p>The US should draw up cor­re­spond­ing strate­gies in re­sponse to China’s grow­ing power and in­ter­na­tional in­flu­ence, he said.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, as China’s eco­nomic and mil­i­tary strength grows, it has to ad­just and in­te­grate into the rules-based in­ter­na­tional sys­tem and take into con­sid­er­a­tion the in­ter­ests and con­cerns of other coun­tries, he added.</p>
    <p>The im­pact of US-China com­pe­ti­tion in ar­eas such as trade, tech­nol­ogy and se­cu­rity will shape the in­ter­na­tional or­der for years to come, Mr Heng noted.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, their co­op­er­a­tion will af­fect the world’s abil­ity to tackle is­sues such as cli­mate change, nu­clear pro­lif­er­a­tion and the spread of in­fec­tious dis­eases, he said.</p>
