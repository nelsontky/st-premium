    <p>Hid­den in cities, vast swathes of land are wait­ing to be re­claimed. It is the space de­voted to park­ing cars, which sit idle for 95 per cent of the day.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, 5.6 mil­lion peo­ple can count on 1.3 mil­lion park­ing spa­ces – more than twice the num­ber of cars. In the United States, park­ing spa­ces amount to an area as vast as its state of Con­necti­cut or the Malaysian state of Tereng­ganu, at just over 13,000 sq km.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the re­cent ex­plo­sion of ride- and ve­hi­cle-shar­ing sys­tems like Uber and Lyft is start­ing to free our cities from the obli­ga­tions of spa­ces for park­ing.</p>
    <p>Such trends are ex­pected to in­crease. With the ex­pan­sion of on­line plat­forms and the ad­vent of self-driv­ing cars, how much longer can we ex­pect this road to go? How much more pave­ment can we re­claim, and what should we do with it?</p>
    <p>Changes to­wards a post-park­ing world are al­ready hap­pen­ing. Park­ing spa­ces which serve as hubs, such as those around air­ports, have started los­ing both their rel­e­vance and their rev­enue. Why spend hefty sums on park­ing as close as pos­si­ble to the Changi run­way when you can ar­range a ride with an app on your phone?</p>
    <p>The same phe­nom­e­non is slowly ad­vanc­ing into city cen­tres, with de­vel­op­ers seek­ing to con­vert garages into other uses. Even un­built park­ing spa­ces are be­gin­ning to be de­signed with the pos­si­bil­ity of fu­ture con­ver­sion in mind, as my de­sign as­so­ci­ates and I have pro­posed with our de­sign for Cap­i­taSpring in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The un­der­ly­ing process is easy to ex­plain: Ev­ery shared ve­hi­cle can re­move up to a dozen pri­vately owned cars from hav­ing to idle in park­ing spa­ces and kerb­sides. Self-driv­ing fleets are ex­pected to achieve the same ef­fect, but at a greater scale.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, in a city where ev­ery­one is shar­ing ve­hi­cles, what would be the the­o­ret­i­cal lower bound or least space re­quired to be set aside for park­ing needs?</p>
    <p>In a new pa­per pub­lished in Na­ture Sci­en­tific Re­ports, ti­tled Ad­dress­ing The ‘Min­i­mum Park­ing’ Prob­lem For On-de­mand Mo­bil­ity, my col­leagues and I tried to quan­tify this num­ber in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Start­ing with a Big Data set that cap­tures over­all mo­bil­ity for the is­land’s res­i­dents, we es­ti­mated the pos­si­ble im­pact of wide­spread shar­ing.</p>
    <p>The most ex­treme pos­si­bil­ity for which we made a math­e­mat­i­cal model – mak­ing ev­ery car in the city self-driv­ing and shared –</p>
    <p>would come with sig­nif­i­cant trade-offs. Empty when mov­ing from rider to rider, each car in the shared fleet would travel many more kilo­me­tres a day than one that idles in a park­ing space.</p>
    <p>To be en­vi­ron­men­tally and in­fras­truc­turally con­sci­en­tious, we mod­elled a new sce­nario in which the over­all mileage in­crease was min­i­mal (capped at 15 per cent).</p>
    <p>Even with this con­straint, the re­sults were as­tound­ing – shared mo­bil­ity could re­duce the amount of nec­es­sary park­ing space in Sin­ga­pore by 86 per cent.</p>
    <p>As­sum­ing each of Sin­ga­pore’s 1.3 mil­lion park­ing spa­ces oc­cu­pies an av­er­age of 15 sq m, this would make up an ag­gre­gate of about 20 mil­lion sq m of park­ing area. If 86</p>
    <p>per cent of this is no longer needed for park­ing, about 17 mil­lion sq m of space would be freed.</p>
    <p>Set­ting aside the cash value of the freed-up space, this area – from hulk­ing garages to scat­tered kerb­side spa­ces – could be­come the launch­ing pad for a post-park­ing ur­ban rev­o­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>KERB CON­VER­SIONS</p>
    <p>The kerb could be con­verted into stag­ing ar­eas for pick­ups, drop-offs and de­liv­er­ies – in­creas­ingly nec­es­sary in a world of ve­hi­cle shar­ing and doorstep ser­vices. In­fras­truc­ture for mi­cro-mo­bil­ity – scoot­ers and bi­cy­cles – and charg­ing sta­tions for elec­tric ve­hi­cles will also de­mand their share.</p>
    <p>This space can also be used to</p>
    <p>en­hance mass trans­porta­tion. Buses are still more af­ford­able and en­vi­ron­men­tally friendly than any form of per­son­alised trans­porta­tion and they could be im­proved fur­ther with dy­namic rout­ing be­tween many stops.</p>
    <p>Even af­ter other forms of trans­porta­tion have taken their fill, there might still be park­ing spa­ces – cracks in the mor­tar of the cityscape – de­mand­ing a new pur­pose.</p>
    <p>To draw in­spi­ra­tion, there can be guerilla ex­per­i­ments such as Park(ing) Day, an in­ter­na­tional event that be­gan in San Fran­cisco in 2005, where res­i­dents con­vert park­ing spa­ces into sit­ting ar­eas, minia­ture parks and play­grounds, art dis­plays and more.</p>
    <p>These one-day in­stal­la­tions could be­come per­ma­nent, blend­ings of pub­lic and pri­vate space that in­vite peo­ple to live to­gether in ev­ery nook and cranny once re­served for in­di­vid­ual cars.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the first Park(ing) Day was held in Septem­ber 2013, and the lat­est edi­tion of the an­nual event took place on Oct 3 in Jurong.</p>
    <p>In short, ev­ery square foot of kerb­side has a thousand pos­si­ble uses in the post-park­ing era. Un­like the fixed na­ture of park­ing, we could use dig­i­tal plat­forms to man­age these dy­nam­i­cally.</p>
    <p>Res­tau­rants could use the kerb­side for out­door din­ing dur­ing peak hours and de­liv­er­ies for the rest of the day – en­vi­sioned by a pro­to­type we de­vel­oped with Google’s sis­ter com­pany Side­walk Labs.</p>
    <p>DY­NAMIC PRO­GRAM­MING</p>
    <p>The need for such dy­namic pro­gram­ming has be­come clear in the wake of Covid-19, when a need to cre­ate so­cial dis­tanc­ing space emerged in a mat­ter of weeks.</p>
    <p>In Paris, we are cur­rently work­ing with pub­lic trans­port op­er­a­tor RATP to map this hid­den ex­panse, learn­ing how peo­ple and busi­nesses use the kerb over the course of the day.</p>
    <p>This dy­namic map­ping, ac­com­plished with deep-learn­ing ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, is the first step to­wards re­pro­gram­ming kerbs and park­ing spa­ces across the world as the need for cars is swept away.</p>
    <p>Clearly, some peo­ple will still want to own pri­vate cars with­out any kind of shar­ing.</p>
    <p>These per­sonal pref­er­ences will vary, by ge­og­ra­phy and cul­ture, from city to city. How­ever, reach­ing even 50 per cent of the un­park­ing lower bound would free up a huge amount of real es­tate.</p>
    <p>From there, the process of the con­ver­sion into new uses and new man­age­ment sys­tems will raise many ques­tions of po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic con­trol – ones that will re­quire ne­go­ti­a­tion and ex­per­i­men­ta­tion to an­swer.</p>
    <p>But ul­ti­mately, it might inch ur­ban ar­eas closer to Amer­i­can pub­lic in­tel­lec­tual Lewis Mum­ford’s fa­mous dream: “For­get the damned mo­tor car and build the cities for lovers and friends.”</p>
    <p>In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy, where he di­rects the Senseable City Lab. He is cur­rently serv­ing as co-chair of the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum’s Global Fu­ture Coun­cil on Cities and Ur­ban­i­sa­tion.</p>
