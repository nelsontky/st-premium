    <p>• There is lit­tle in mod­ern foot­ball that can truly be de­scribed as a fairy-tale ro­mance but RB Leipzig’s jour­ney from Ger­many’s re­gional league sys­tem to the last four of the Cham­pi­ons League in just 11 years surely gets close.</p>
    <p>The 2-1 up­set over La Liga’s Atletico Madrid at the Es­ta­dio Jose Al­valade on Thurs­day sent the Bun­desliga club into the semi-fi­nals for the first time, where they will face French cham­pi­ons Paris Saint-Ger­main.</p>
    <p>Not even the most am­bi­tious of those in­volved in the club’s cre­ation in 2009 could have imag­ined their team be­ing 90 min­utes away from the big­gest game in Euro­pean club foot­ball.</p>
    <p>But Tyler Adams’ de­flected win­ner two min­utes from time – Leipzig had opened the scor­ing through Dani Olmo be­fore Joao Felix equalised from the spot – means their sights are trained firmly on the club’s first ma­jor tro­phy.</p>
    <p>“It’s nor­mal that when you get to the next round, you want more. Tonight, we’re happy. To­mor­row, we will start l ook­ing at Paris,” coach Ju­lian Nagels­mann said.</p>
    <p>“That’ll be an­other dif­fi­cult game, but we’ll have a plan. It is only nor­mal that we want to reach the fi­nal now. That’s clear. When we are there, then we can talk again.</p>
    <p>“It was the team that elim­i­nated</p>
    <p>Tot­ten­ham and now Atletico. It is a team sport and the boys were out­stand­ing. We were the bet­ter team.</p>
    <p>“This young team showed no nerves. Now to recharge. The match that awaits us is an­other big game, an even big­ger one. So the bat­ter­ies recharge a bit faster.”</p>
    <p>The fact that their rapid rise has been bankrolled by en­ergy drink com­pany Red Bull has left Leipzig unloved by many in Ger­man foot­ball.</p>
    <p>How­ever, their suc­cess is about much more than the mil­lions of eu­ros pumped into the club, and far more to do with their scout­ing net­work and abil­ity to bring play­ers through.</p>
    <p>Leipzig have their feeder clubs in Ma­jor League Soc­cer’s New York Red Bulls and Aus­tria’s RB Salzburg, but the fo­cus has never been on mega-money sign­ings.</p>
    <p>It is worth not­ing that their most ex­pen­sive pur­chase on the field against Atletico was Slove­nian mid­fielder Kevin Kampl, who cost €20 mil­lion (S$32.4 mil­lion) when he moved from Bayer Lev­erkusen in 2017 – a frac­tion of the €126 mil­lion Atletico paid Ben­fica for Felix last year.</p>
    <p>In­deed, their strat­egy makes them an at­trac­tive club for young play­ers, as does Nagels­mann. At 33, he is the youngest coach to lead a team to the last four of the Cham­pi­ons League and the former Hof­fen­heim boss is al­ready be­ing watched closely by lead­ing clubs who sus­pect he might be the next Jur­gen Klopp.</p>
    <p>No one gave Leipzig much of a chance after they sold their best player and top scorer Timo Werner to Chelsea last month, but to make up for the loss of the 34-goal striker, Nagels­mann changed his sys­tem to “play with three of­fen­sive mid­field­ers to cre­ate the space”.</p>
    <p>Even Atletico coach Diego Sime­one, a renowned tac­ti­cian, ad­mit­ted that he was out­smarted by his coun­ter­part, whose team were “bet­ter, faster... and de­served their vic­tory”.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing al­ready es­tab­lished them­selves as Bun­desliga con­tenders and reg­u­lar Cham­pi­ons League en­trants, a win against PSG on Tues­day will of­fer more proof Leipzig are well ahead of the curve.</p>
    <p>“We reached the Bun­desliga and now qual­i­fied for the Cham­pi­ons League two times,” Nagels­mann said. “We’re still in the Cham­pi­ons League. The progress is faster than usual.”</p>
