    <p>LON­DON • Jose Mour­inho ac­cused some of his play­ers of lazi­ness and poor fit­ness after a lack­lus­tre Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur lost 1-0 to Ever­ton at home in their Pre­mier League opener on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Do­minic Calvert-Lewin’s 55thminute header set­tled the is­sue and Tot­ten­ham’s dis­play, es­pe­cially in the sec­ond half, led to some harsh words from man­ager Mour­inho.</p>
    <p>“Against good teams like Ever­ton, if you let them play from the back they are com­fort­able with very good tech­ni­cal play­ers. If you don’t press them, you give them am­mu­ni­tion,” the Por­tuguese said.</p>
    <p>“We were lazy in our press­ing. That is a con­se­quence of bad fit­ness, bad pre-sea­son. Some play­ers didn’t even have a pre-sea­son. Some play­ers had a wrong state of mind. I don’t want to speak about it – I’m not sure about it.”</p>
    <p>Spurs have been the sub­ject of a can­did doc­u­men­tary chron­i­cling his ar­rival at the club to re­place for­mer man­ager Mauri­cio Po­chet­tino last Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>It might be just as well that the be­hind-the-scenes cam­eras have been switched off after their plod­ding dis­play against Ever­ton.</p>
    <p>Striker Harry Kane barely had a sight of goal, al­though he was not helped by a mid­field lack­ing imag­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>“I’m dis­ap­pointed with my team.</p>
    <p>My mes­sage is in­side (the dress­ing room),” Mour­inho added.</p>
    <p>“I’m so happy no more (film­ing for the) Ama­zon (doc­u­men­tary) be­cause these things can stay be­tween us.”</p>
    <p>With Carlo Ancelotti in the op­pos­ing dugout, it was a meet­ing of two of the game’s most dec­o­rated coaches, but it was Ital­ian Ancelotti who won the head-to-head hands down.</p>
    <p>With Colom­bian play­maker James Ro­driguez, signed this week from Real Madrid, French pow­er­house Ab­doulaye Doucoure and Brazil­ian mid­fielder Allan all mak­ing i mpres­sive de­buts, Ever­ton were un­recog­nis­able from the stodgy team who fin­ished 12th last sea­son.</p>
    <p>“This per­for­mance gives us more confidence for the fu­ture,” Ancelotti, like Mour­inho start­ing his first full sea­son in charge, said.</p>
    <p>“We showed what we can do. The new sign­ings had one week of train­ing but adapted re­ally well. The per­for­mance was good. James Ro­driguez brings his abil­ity to con­trol the ball, to do the right passes, to keep the team com­fort­able with the ball.</p>
    <p>“I said be­fore the game our tar­get was to fight for the Euro­pean places. I think we can com­pete with this squad in all the com­pe­ti­tions.”</p>
