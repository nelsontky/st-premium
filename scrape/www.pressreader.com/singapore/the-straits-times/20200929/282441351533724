    <p>CRIME FIC­TION/MYS­TERY</p>
    <p>By Richard Os­man</p>
    <p>Pen­guin Books/Pa­per­back/</p>
    <p>380 pages/$27.82/</p>
    <p>Avail­able at: bit.ly/Thurs­dayMC_RO</p>
    <p>There are no de­tec­tives with in­ner demons chas­ing down se­rial mur­der­ers in English tele­vi­sion pre­sen­ter Richard Os­man’s The Thurs­day Murder Club.</p>
    <p>In­stead, four se­niors liv­ing in a re­tire­ment vil­lage built on con­verted con­vent grounds dis­cuss cold cases once a week for two hours be­tween Art His­tory and Con­ver­sa­tional French.</p>
    <p>Things heat up when these arm­chair de­tec­tives try to crack a real murder case: A lo­cal builder hired to tear down the con­vent’s ceme­tery is blud­geoned to death af­ter a visit to the vil­lage.</p>
    <p>This murder mys­tery falls squarely into the genre of cosy crime fic­tion – no ex­plicit vi­o­lence or sex, just tea and baked goods be­tween, and some­times dur­ing, the in­ter­ro­ga­tion of sus­pects.</p>
    <p>While this book is hardly ground­break­ing, it is a highly sat­is­fy­ing read packed with charm­ing char­ac­ters.</p>
    <p>There is Joyce, the club’s new­est mem­ber and a re­tired nurse who acts as the point-of-view char­ac­ter be­tween chap­ters.</p>
    <p>The club is led by El­iz­a­beth, a woman with a mys­te­ri­ous yet il­lus­tri­ous ca­reer. The other mem­bers are re­tired ther­a­pist Ibrahim and Ron, a fire­brand ex-trade union­ist.</p>
    <p>Their di­a­logue makes for some of the fun­ni­est mo­ments in the story, which has plenty of laugh-out-loud hu­mour. At one point, the club at­tempts to nar­row down the iden­tity of a killer who may be liv­ing in the vil­lage and has ac­cess to nee­dles and drugs, to which El­iz­a­beth replies: “That’s ev­ery­one here.”</p>
    <p>Os­man plays up his pro­tag­o­nists’ age at ev­ery turn, though not with­out good rea­son. Old age is the su­per­power of the murder club. It af­fords the four Sher­locks a will­ing­ness to play fast and loose with the law, and a so­cial ad­van­tage that de­mands peo­ple treat them kindly.</p>
    <p>Their swash­buck­ling ways are bal­anced by the book’s qui­eter mo­ments, which give its el­derly cast space to con­tem­plate their fi­nal years.</p>
    <p>Age­ing can be a cruel process – the sud­den re­al­i­sa­tion that a spade will be too heavy to lift, or liv­ing in con­stant fear that your mem­ory will soon slip away.</p>
    <p>The story does get a lit­tle overly sen­ti­men­tal near its con­clu­sion, giv­ing ev­ery red-herring sus­pect a back­story, some of which skew to­wards the tragic. The big re­veal is a tad pre­dictable as well, but this novel, meant to be the first in a se­ries, re­mains en­joy­able nev­er­the­less.</p>
    <p>The Thurs­day Murder Club is not meant to keep you on the edge of your seat, but for curling up in an arm­chair with a cup of hot tea.</p>
    <p>If you like this, read:</p>
    <p>Big Sky by Kate Atkinson (Transworld, 2019, $29.27, avail­able at: bit.ly/bigskykate­atkin­son), the lat­est in the au­thor’s Jack­son Brodie de­tec­tive se­ries. In this in­stal­ment, Brodie is liv­ing a quiet life by the sea. While gath­er­ing ev­i­dence on an un­faith­ful hus­band, he gets pulled back into a sin­is­ter net­work in­ter­twined with his past.</p>
