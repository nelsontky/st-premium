    <p>CHICAGO • As the pan­demic rages, chil­dren’s vis­its with Santa Claus are go­ing vir­tual – to pro­tect both them and the men in high­risk groups who dress up as old St Nick.</p>
    <p>“I’m not fool­ing around with the pan­demic,” said Mr Joe Harkins, an 87-year-old Santa from Jersey City, New Jersey. “I’m not go­ing to risk my life for any fam­ily or pub­lic events. It’s just too risky.”</p>
    <p>Mr Harkins, like many of his broth­ers-in-red, as many San­tas re­fer to one an­other, has taken his win­ter gig on­line, opt­ing to swop in-per­son vis­its for vir­tual ones.</p>
    <p>He has even gone so far as to start a com­pany called Santa En­coun­ters, where prospec­tive San­tas can sign up to make per­son­alised videos for chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“By def­i­ni­tion, most San­tas are in the most high-risk cat­e­gory ei­ther by age or un­der­ly­ing med­i­cal con­di­tions,” said Mr Ric Er­win, head of Cal­i­for­nia-based Fra­ter­nal Order of Real Bearded San­tas.</p>
    <p>“This is fur­ther com­pacted by the fact that our tar­get de­mo­graphic is young chil­dren, who are no­to­ri­ous vec­tors for all things in­fec­tious,” Mr Er­win added.</p>
    <p>Mr John Sullivan, an 81-year-old Santa from Stream­wood, Illi­nois, has shifted to all-vir­tual vis­its.</p>
    <p>This is the first year in his 30-year Santa ca­reer that he will not see chil­dren in per­son.</p>
    <p>But this comes with the ad­van­tage of learn­ing, in ad­vance from the par­ents, about the chil­dren he will speak to.</p>
    <p>“I learn their names, the names of their sib­lings, what they want, the name of their pet... So when I start talk­ing to the kids they are like, ‘Hey, this Santa knows all about me!’” said Mr Sullivan.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has not wiped out all mall San­tas, although it has al­tered the way many vis­its are con­ducted. Cherry Hill Pro­grammes, which runs Santa vis­its at more than 700 re­tail lo­ca­tions through­out the United States, has made vis­its with Santa a con­tact­less ex­pe­ri­ence this year.</p>
    <p>Guests need to wear masks and make reser­va­tions to elim­i­nate lines, Santa and staff have daily health screen­ings and tem­per­a­ture checks, and chil­dren are not al­lowed to sit on Santa’s lap.</p>
    <p>In­stead, Santa sits on his high chair with a plas­tic shield over his face and a plex­i­glass sheet in front of him, while guests are seated on a bench 1.8m in front of him, fac­ing a masked pho­tog­ra­pher who then takes a pic­ture.</p>
    <p>A re­cent ap­pear­ance by a mask­less Santa and Mrs Claus in Ge­or­gia turned into ev­ery par­ents’ night­mare.</p>
    <p>On Dec 10, ap­prox­i­mately 50 chil­dren were ex­posed to Covid-19 af­ter hav­ing their pic­tures taken with Santa and Mrs Claus at a Christ­mas pa­rade.</p>
    <p>The in­di­vid­u­als who served as Santa and Mrs Claus were not symp­to­matic at the event but tested pos­i­tive a few days later.</p>
