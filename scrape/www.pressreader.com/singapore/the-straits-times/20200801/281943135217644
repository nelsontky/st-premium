    <p>• Twit­ter, whose in­ter­nal sys­tems were breached about two weeks ago, has said the in­ci­dent tar­geted a small num­ber of em­ploy­ees through a phone “spear-phish­ing” at­tack.</p>
    <p>The United States mi­croblog­ging site said on Thurs­day that the hack­ers tar­geted about 130 ac­counts, tweeted from 45, ac­cessed the in­box of 36, and were able to down­load Twit­ter data from seven.</p>
    <p>At­tack­ers also tar­geted spe­cific em­ploy­ees who had ac­cess to ac­count sup­port tools, Twit­ter said, adding that it re­stricted ac­cess to its in­ter­nal tools and sys­tems since the in­ci­dent oc­curred.</p>
    <p>Hack­ers had ac­cessed Twit­ter’s in­ter­nal sys­tems on July 15 to hi­jack some of the plat­form’s top voices, in­clud­ing US pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den, re­al­ity TV star Kim Kar­dashian, for­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama and bil­lion­aire Elon Musk, and used them to so­licit dig­i­tal cur­rency.</p>
    <p>Pub­licly avail­able blockchain records show the ap­par­ent scammers re­ceived more than US$100,000 (S$137,000) worth of cryp­tocur­rency.</p>
    <p>The “spear-phish­ing” tech­nique is a prac­tice of send­ing e-mails os­ten­si­bly from a known or trusted sender in or­der to in­duce tar­geted in­di­vid­u­als to re­veal confidenti­al in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Reuters re­ported last week that more than a thou­sand Twit­ter em­ploy­ees and con­trac­tors as of ear­lier this year had ac­cess to in­ter­nal tools that could change user ac­count set­tings and hand con­trol to oth­ers, mak­ing it hard to de­fend against the hack­ing.</p>
