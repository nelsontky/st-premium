    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysian For­eign Min­is­ter Hisham­mud­din Hus­sein said China’s coast guard and navy ves­sels have not been seen en­croach­ing into Malaysian waters in the last 100 days, but his pre­de­ces­sor has re­but­ted this view.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Hisham­mud­din stated on Wed­nes­day that the lack of in­tru­sions was due to strength­ened bi­lat­eral re­la­tions in the 100 days since he took over the For­eign Min­istry as part of the four-month-old Perikatan Na­sional gov­ern­ment, Free Malaysia To­day (FMT) news site quoted him as say­ing.</p>
    <p>“One area I’ve had to work on since helm­ing Wisma Pu­tra (For­eign Min­istry) is to i mprove Malaysia’s ties with China, In­dia, Saudi Ara­bia and the United Arab Emi­rates. So, when we talk about South China Sea, of course, the re­la­tion­ship with China is im­por­tant.”</p>
    <p>He told a me­dia con­fer­ence in Par­lia­ment, as quoted by FMT: “The lat­est, in the 100 days of helm­ing</p>
    <p>Wisma Pu­tra, Chi­nese ves­sels have not been seen in our waters, so how did we man­age this?</p>
    <p>“This is be­tween us and the Chi­nese lead­er­ship. My stand is very clear; we will not com­pro­mise on our sovereignt­y.”</p>
    <p>A re­port by Malaysia’s Au­di­torGen­eral is­sued on Tues­day said that Chi­nese coast guard and navy ships in­truded into Malaysian waters in the dis­puted South China Sea 89 times be­tween 2016 and last year.</p>
    <p>The re­port also said that these ves­sels of­ten re­mained in the area even af­ter be­ing turned away by the Malaysian navy.</p>
    <p>For­mer for­eign min­is­ter Ani­fah Aman has re­but­ted Mr Hisham­mud­din’s view, say­ing the min­is­ter must more as­sertively de­fend Malaysia’s sovereignt­y against con­tin­ued Chi­nese en­croach­ment.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Ani­fah – who, like Mr Hisham­mud­din, is from Umno – said: “I am ap­palled by the min­is­ter’s state­ment.</p>
    <p>“He is ei­ther in denial or ig­no­rant of the fact. Worst, he is play­ing pol­i­tics with Malaysia’s mar­itime and strate­gic in­ter­ests.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ani­fah was quoted as say­ing by the Malay Mail yes­ter­day: “It was only in April that a flotilla of Chi­nese en­force­ment ves­sels was sighted ac­com­pa­ny­ing a Chi­nese sur­vey ves­sel within Malaysian mar­itime ar­eas. Fur­ther, I was re­li­ably in­formed that Chi­nese coast guard ves­sels were sighted in the vicin­ity of Bet­ing Pat­inggi Ali in May, June and July.”</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to Mr Ani­fah’s crit­i­cism, Mr Hisham­mud­din yes­ter­day said there was only one in­ci­dent when Chi­nese ves­sels had en­croached into Malaysian waters since he took over.</p>
    <p>He was re­fer­ring to the sur­vey ship that en­tered Malaysian waters, ac­com­pa­nied by Chi­nese coast guard and fishing ves­sels in April and which he said stayed around till May.</p>
