    <p>WASH­ING­TON • United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump on Wed­nes­day par­doned his for­mer na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser Michael Flynn, who had pleaded guilty to ly­ing to the FBI dur­ing the in­ves­ti­ga­tion into Rus­sian med­dling in the 2016 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s par­don, which could be the first of sev­eral af­ter he lost the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion to Demo­crat Joe Bi­den, drew con­dem­na­tion from Democrats and other crit­ics.</p>
    <p>A re­tired army gen­eral, Mr Flynn pleaded guilty to ly­ing to the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion about in­ter­ac­tions he had with Rus­sia’s am­bas­sador to the US in the weeks leading up to Mr Trump’s inau­gu­ra­tion in Jan­uary 2017.</p>
    <p>He has since sought to with­draw</p>
    <p>the plea, ar­gu­ing that pros­e­cu­tors vi­o­lated his rights and duped him into a plea agree­ment. His sen­tenc­ing has been de­ferred sev­eral times.</p>
    <p>“It is my great hon­our to an­nounce that Gen­eral Michael T. Flynn has been granted a full par­don. Con­grat­u­la­tions to #Gen</p>
    <p>Flynn and his won­der­ful fam­ily, I know you will now have a truly fan­tas­tic Thanks­giv­ing!” Mr Trump wrote on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Flynn’s at­tor­ney Sid­ney Pow­ell, who told a court in Septem­ber that she per­son­ally asked Mr Trump not to par­don her client, said the par­don was “bit­ter­sweet” be­cause Mr Flynn was in­no­cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s move marked the high­est-pro­file par­don he has granted since he took of­fice.</p>
    <p>Among oth­ers, the Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent has par­doned army per­son­nel ac­cused of war crimes in Afghanista­n and Mr Joe Ar­paio, a for­mer Ari­zona sher­iff and hard­liner against il­le­gal im­mi­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>“This par­don is un­de­served, un­prin­ci­pled, and one more stain on Pres­i­dent Trump’s rapidly di­min­ish­ing legacy,” House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives Ju­di­ciary Com­mit­tee chair­man Jerry Nadler said.</p>
    <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called it “an act of grave cor­rup­tion and a brazen abuse of power.”</p>
    <p>Mr Flynn served as Mr Trump’s first na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser but the Pres­i­dent fired him in early 2017 af­ter only 24 days, as a con­tro­versy broke over the for­mer gen­eral’s con­tacts with then Rus­sian Am­bas­sador Sergei Kislyak.</p>
    <p>Mr Flynn was one of sev­eral for­mer Trump aides to plead guilty or be con­victed at trial in for­mer spe­cial coun­sel Robert Mueller’s in­ves­ti­ga­tion into Moscow’s in­ter­fer­ence in the 2016 US elec­tion to boost Mr Trump’s can­di­dacy. Rus­sia de­nied med­dling.</p>
    <p>In May, At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Wil­liam Barr stunned many in the le­gal com­mu­nity by or­der­ing pros­e­cu­tors to have the case dropped, a de­ci­sion that came af­ter Mr Trump re­peat­edly com­plained that Mr Flynn was be­ing treated un­fairly.</p>
    <p>Mr Flynn and the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion said US District Judge Em­met Sul­li­van, who presided over the case, was re­quired by law to grant the re­quest for dis­missal.</p>
    <p>An ap­peals court in Au­gust de­nied Mr Flynn’s re­quest to or­der the judge to end the case.</p>
    <p>“The Pres­i­dent has par­doned Gen­eral Flynn be­cause he should never have been pros­e­cuted,” the White House said. “In fact, the De­part­ment of Jus­tice has firmly con­cluded that the charges against Gen­eral Flynn should be dropped. This full par­don achieves that ob­jec­tive, fi­nally bring­ing to an end the re­lent­less, partisan pur­suit of an in­no­cent man.”</p>
