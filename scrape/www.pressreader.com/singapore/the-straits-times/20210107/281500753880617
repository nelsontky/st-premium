    <p>Hong Kong po­lice con­ducted a na­tional se­cu­rity sweep yes­ter­day morn­ing that re­sulted in the ar­rest of dozens of ac­tivists in the op­po­si­tion bloc.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing threw its weight be­hind the blitz as the op­er­a­tion, which in­volved 1,000 of­fi­cers, drew flak from the United States and Taiwan.</p>
    <p>Hours af­ter the sweep, the po­lice, at a short brief­ing, said 45 men and eight women aged be­tween 23 and 64 were rounded up for sub­ver­sion un­der Ar­ti­cle 22 of the na­tional se­cu­rity law, which was en­acted in June last year.</p>
    <p>They said the lat­est round of ar­rests was linked to the un­of­fi­cial pri­maries the op­po­si­tion held in July last year to choose can­di­dates from the pan-demo­cratic camp to run in the Septem­ber Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil (LegCo) elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Of the 53 ar­rested, six were picked up for al­legedly or­gan­is­ing the pri­maries while the rest were “so-called can­di­dates”.</p>
    <p>Le­gal scholar Benny Tai, co-or­gan­iser of the un­of­fi­cial pri­maries who was also con­victed as a leader of the Oc­cupy Cen­tral Move­ment in 2014, and Amer­i­can John Clancey, a lawyer in Hong Kong, were among those ar­rested.</p>
    <p>The un­of­fi­cial pri­mary elec­tion, an idea of Mr Tai’s, was a strat­egy to help the op­po­si­tion bloc win a ma­jor­ity in the 70-seat Hong Kong</p>
    <p>leg­is­la­ture. This would have en­abled the op­po­si­tion camp to block all gov­ern­ment pro­pos­als and mount pres­sure for demo­cratic re­forms, such as the exit of the chief ex­ec­u­tive. Ar­ti­cle 52 of the Ba­sic Law or the city’s mini Con­sti­tu­tion, states that the chief ex­ec­u­tive must re­sign if he or she re­peat­edly fails to get a bud­get ap­proved by the leg­is­la­ture.</p>
    <p>Now sched­uled for Septem­ber, the LegCo elec­tion was post­poned for a year by Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam, who cited the sever­ity</p>
    <p>of the Covid-19 pan­demic as a key rea­son for the move.</p>
    <p>A post on former De­mo­sisto leader Joshua Wong’s Face­book page said his home was raided as well. The 24-year-old is serv­ing time for or­gan­is­ing and in­cit­ing oth­ers to join a protest out­side the po­lice head­quar­ters in 2019.</p>
    <p>The po­lice also de­manded at least four me­dia com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing on­line me­dia out­let Stand News, to hand over doc­u­ments re­lated to the pri­maries.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing yes­ter­day de­fended the</p>
    <p>ar­rests as a nec­es­sary mea­sure to stop “ex­ter­nal forces and in­di­vid­u­als” col­lud­ing to un­der­mine China, while the li­ai­son of­fice in Hong Kong said “the gen­eral pub­lic can see clearly the sin­is­ter in­ten­tions of Benny Tai and oth­ers and their harm to Hong Kong so­ci­ety”.</p>
    <p>But US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s long-time aide and his pick for Sec­re­tary of State, Mr Antony Blinken, on Twit­ter called the sweep­ing ar­rests of pro-democ­racy demon­stra­tors “an as­sault on those bravely ad­vo­cat­ing for</p>
    <p>uni­ver­sal rights”.</p>
    <p>Taiwan’s Main­land Af­fairs Coun­cil said in a state­ment that “the ‘Pearl of the Ori­ent’ has now turned into a shock­ing ‘Pur­ga­tory of the Ori­ent’”.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Union called for the re­lease of those ar­rested, adding that it was eye­ing fur­ther sanc­tions on China over the crack­down in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Hong Kongers were shocked and di­vided af­ter the po­lice rounded up more than 50 politi­cians and ac­tivists yes­ter­day in a fresh wave of ar­rests.</p>
    <p>Sec­re­tary for Se­cu­rity John Lee said “ac­tive el­e­ments who are sus­pected to have been in­volved in the crime of over­throw­ing or in­ter­fer­ing or se­ri­ously de­stroy­ing the Hong Kong gov­ern­ment’s le­gal ex­e­cu­tion of du­ties” were tar­geted.</p>
    <p>He tried to as­sure the 600,000 res­i­dents who voted in the so-called pri­maries last year that they were not the tar­gets.</p>
    <p>Po­lice had ear­lier con­firmed that the ar­rests were linked to the un­of­fi­cial pri­maries that the op­po­si­tion held last July to choose can­di­dates from the pan-demo­cratic camp to run in the Septem­ber Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil (LegCo) polls.</p>
    <p>“The peo­ple in­volved are sus­pected of mak­ing use of what they call a ‘35+’ plan and a 10-step mu­tual de­struc­tion scheme to some­how paral­yse the Hong Kong gov­ern­ment,” said Mr Lee, in a ref­er­ence to Oc­cupy Cen­tral move­ment leader Benny Tai’s strat­egy.</p>
    <p>The 10-step mu­tual dis­rup­tion plan – in which the op­po­si­tion mo­bilises large-scale ri­ots to paral­yse so­ci­ety, cou­pled with in­ter­na­tional sanc­tions, “will re­sult in se­ri­ous dam­age to so­ci­ety as a whole”, the se­cu­rity chief said, adding that this was the rea­son for the po­lice ac­tion.</p>
    <p>The city’s pro-Bei­jing law­mak­ers wel­comed the ar­rests, de­nounc­ing the pri­maries as part of plans to force Hong Kong Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam to re­sign, cre­ate a vac­uum in Par­lia­ment and over­throw Hong Kong’s sovereignt­y. They said these were a clear vi­o­la­tion of the se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>But the Civil Hu­man Rights Front, in a state­ment ti­tled “The Great Purge”, said the law­mak­ers had done no wrong.</p>
    <p>“Through the pri­mary elec­tion, the can­di­dates only ex­er­cised their rights to de­bate their po­lit­i­cal stance and the elec­tors had the free­dom to elect those who are in their favour, which both have been granted by the Ba­sic Law. They should not have been treated as vi­o­la­tions of the na­tional se­cu­rity law,” it said.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal ob­server Lau Siu Kai, vice-pres­i­dent of the Chi­nese As­so­ci­a­tion of Hong Kong and Ma­cau Stud­ies – Bei­jing’s top think-tank on Hong Kong – noted that re­peated warn­ings by of­fi­cials had fallen on deaf ears.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong gov­ern­ment as well as Mrs Lam had last July warned that the act of hold­ing the re­fer­ring to the un­of­fi­cial pri­maries that the op­po­si­tion held last July to choose can­di­dates from the pan-demo­cratic camp to run in the Septem­ber Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil polls. un­of­fi­cial pri­maries might be treated as sub­ver­sion.</p>
    <p>“What the gov­ern­ment is do­ing now is to strictly en­force the na­tional se­cu­rity law, up­hold the au­thor­ity of the law and pro­mote its de­ter­rent ef­fect,” said Mr Lau.</p>
    <p>“As the pre­pon­der­ant pri­or­ity is to safe­guard na­tional se­cu­rity, other con­cerns are of less im­por­tance.”</p>
    <p>He also saw a sil­ver lin­ing in the gov­ern­ment’s move, say­ing it would “clar­ify and con­cre­tise” the mean­ing of the se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion politi­cians, Mr Lau said, could now op­er­ate only within the frame­work of the Chi­nese Con­sti­tu­tion, the Hong Kong Ba­sic Law and the na­tional se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>But one ob­server, who de­clined to be named for fear of retri­bu­tion, be­lieved the lat­est move was meant to purge the en­tire op­po­si­tion camp, es­pe­cially the crop of younger, more vo­cal and more ex­treme op­po­si­tion can­di­dates who won in the un­of­fi­cial pri­maries.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, the ob­server said, the ar­rest of so­cial worker and eth­nic mi­nor­ity cham­pion</p>
    <p>Jef­frey An­drews pointed to the fact that dis­sent would be oblit­er­ated and no one viewed by the gov­ern­ment as a threat to its sta­bil­ity would be spared.</p>
    <p>Six months since the na­tional se­cu­rity law was en­acted, the au­thor­i­ties have ar­rested prom­i­nent pro-democ­racy ac­tivists in­clud­ing Joshua Wong, who is now serv­ing time, and me­dia ty­coon Jimmy Lai.</p>
    <p>A dozen pan-demo­crat law­mak­ers have also been dis­qual­i­fied from run­ning in the now-shelved LegCo elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cial crack­down has prompted ac­tivists such as Mr Nathan Law and former law­maker Ted Hui to leave Hong Kong and go into self-im­posed ex­ile.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post, Mr Law, who fled to Bri­tain, called on peo­ple not to panic, say­ing the true aim of the gov­ern­ment was to strike fear into res­i­dents to crush dis­sent and de­ter re­sis­tance. He also called on the op­po­si­tion to pre­pare for a pub­lic-opin­ion war.</p>
    <p>‘THEY DID NO WRONG’</p>
    <p>Through the pri­mary elec­tion, the can­di­dates only ex­er­cised their rights to de­bate their po­lit­i­cal stance and the elec­tors had the free­dom to elect those who are in their favour, which both have been granted by the</p>
    <p>Ba­sic Law. They should not have been treated as vi­o­la­tions of the na­tional se­cu­rity law.</p>
