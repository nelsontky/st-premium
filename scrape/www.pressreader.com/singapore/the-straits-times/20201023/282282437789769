    <p>LON­DON • After the un­mask­ing of its state-or­ches­trated dop­ing pro­gramme turned it into a sport­ing pariah, Rus­sia hardly qui­etly ac­cepted its pun­ish­ment.</p>
    <p>An­gered and hu­mil­i­ated, it has fought, so far un­suc­cess­fully, to reen­ter the in­ter­na­tional sports com­mu­nity through le­gal chan­nels.</p>
    <p>But US pros­e­cu­tors and Bri­tish govern­ment of­fi­cials say, it went much fur­ther than that, ac­tively seek­ing to un­der­mine the Olympics it was barred from.</p>
    <p>Just as it used the full might of the state in a cheat­ing scheme that brought it now-dis­puted medals at events like the 2014 Sochi Win­ter Games, Rus­sia un­leashed some of the same forces to hack and dis­rupt the open­ing cer­e­mony of the 2018 Pyeongchan­g Win­ter Games and the now-de­layed 2020 Tokyo Olympics, ac­cord­ing to US and Bri­tish of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Now, once again, the In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC) is left to de­cide what, if any, ac­tion to take against one of the largest and most in­flu­en­tial coun­tries in its move­ment, one that has time and again chal­lenged its ideals.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to US and Bri­tish au­thor­i­ties, op­er­a­tives from Rus­sia’s mil­i­tary in­tel­li­gence wing un­leashed a bar­rage of cy­ber at­tacks on the 2018 Win­ter Olympics and started op­er­a­tions against the Tokyo Games as part of a broader world­wide hack­ing cam­paign that also in­cluded at­tacks on a French pres­i­den­tial elec­tion and Ukraine’s elec­tric­ity grid.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia de­nied the al­le­ga­tions, as it did when de­tails of its dop­ing pro­gramme first emerged and after at­tacks on other sport­ing bod­ies, in­clud­ing the global dop­ing reg­u­la­tor.</p>
    <p>A Krem­lin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, on Tues­day de­scribed the ac­cu­sa­tions as “Rus­so­pho­bia”.</p>
    <p>“Rus­sia has never car­ried out any hack­ing ac­tiv­i­ties against the Olympics,” he said.</p>
    <p>The ac­cu­sa­tions come as Rus­sia tries to over­turn the four-year ban from ma­jor in­ter­na­tional sport­ing events it re­ceived in De­cem­ber, when ex­perts at the world’s an­ti­dop­ing reg­u­la­tor found that Rus­sian of­fi­cials ma­nip­u­lated key data that would have al­lowed sports fed­er­a­tions to fi­nally iden­tify the hun­dreds of ath­letes it helped to cheat.</p>
    <p>For the IOC and its pres­i­dent, Thomas Bach, the lat­est de­tails of Rus­sian malfea­sance are likely to be a bit­ter blow.</p>
    <p>For years, the Olympic move­ment has stopped well short of pun­ish­ing Rus­sia with the most se­vere penal­ties, which would in­clude bar­ring any Rus­sian ath­letes from ap­pear­ing at the Olympics or par­tic­i­pat­ing in re­gional events.</p>
    <p>Travis Ty­gart, who heads the US Anti-Dop­ing Agency, an­other group that Rus­sia tried to hack, said he was not sur­prised in the slight­est by the lat­est de­vel­op­ments.</p>
    <p>He said “their be­hav­iour has not changed one bit”, and the ab­sence of mean­ing­ful pun­ish­ment, in his view, has only em­bold­ened Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>“The pow­ers that be don’t have the courage to stand up to Rus­sia even when they dam­age and maybe per­ma­nently dam­age the Olympic brand and the Olympic val­ues,” he said. “If a tod­dler keeps get­ting what it asks for and keeps dis­obey­ing the rules, why would they act dif­fer­ently?”</p>
