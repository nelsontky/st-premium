    <p>Videoconfe­rencing app Zoom be­gan the year as a vir­tual un­known, but has be­come a house­hold name as the Covid-19 pan­demic pro­foundly changed how peo­ple live and work around the globe.</p>
    <p>No­body could have fore­seen at the start of 2020 how much of the year would be spent on­line, and how widely peo­ple’s so­cial and pro­fes­sional lives would be up­ended.</p>
    <p>These dis­rup­tions have been some­what mit­i­gated by Zoom, as bil­lions world­wide hun­ker down at home amid calls to re­duce hu­man con­tact to curb in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Ri­val apps – Mi­crosoft Teams, Google Meet, Cisco We­bex, Skype and Slack, just to name a few – can like­wise do the job. But none of them was ar­guably as per­va­sive as Zoom, one of the big­gest tech suc­cess sto­ries of the year.</p>
    <p>Its epony­mous de­vel­oper – known in full as Zoom Video Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and based in San Jose in the United States – is ex­pand­ing world­wide and will open a re­search and de­vel­op­ment cen­tre in Sin­ga­pore next year.</p>
    <p>Share prices of the Nas­daq-listed com­pany have soared by more than five times this year, after open­ing at US$68.72 on the first trad­ing day of 2020.</p>
    <p>It was trad­ing at more than US$350 at the be­gin­ning of this week, hav­ing pared gains from a high of US$588.84 in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Global sales for the cur­rent quar­ter are ex­pected to rise a whop­ping 367 per cent year on year to US$777.2 mil­lion, the com­pany said in a Ja­panese-lan­guage blog post this month.</p>
    <p>Zoom added, with­out pro­vid­ing newer fig­ures, that the num­ber of daily users rose from an av­er­age of 10 mil­lion world­wide in De­cem­ber last year to 300 mil­lion in April.</p>
    <p>Cy­ber-se­cu­rity fears and con­nec­tiv­ity prob­lems man­i­fest­ing in frozen screens or laggy videos have done noth­ing to stop Zoom’s ex­po­nen­tial growth.</p>
    <p>The app, which has func­tions such as screen-shar­ing and si­mul­ta­ne­ous in­ter­pre­ta­tion, has in­fil­trated nearly ev­ery so­cial set­ting one can think of.</p>
    <p>It is be­ing used by schools and uni­ver­si­ties to con­duct lec­tures and classes, and by com­pa­nies to hold meet­ings and sem­i­nars.</p>
    <p>And then there are on­line gym ses­sions, mu­sic lessons, and even on­line drink­ing par­ties or catch-up ses­sions among friends.</p>
    <p>In Ja­pan, the num­ber of free Zoom users surged 63 times be­tween Jan­uary and April, with the num­ber of com­pa­nies that have bought at least 10 li­cences jump­ing from 2,500 to 20,000 this year.</p>
    <p>Zoom said in a blog post that among its clients are start-ups and multi­na­tional con­glom­er­ates in sec­tors as di­verse as tech­nol­ogy, man­u­fac­tur­ing, re­tail and avi­a­tion, as well as ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions and govern­ment agen­cies.</p>
    <p>The rise of Zoom amid the Covid-19 pan­demic has fu­elled the wide­spread adop­tion of re­mote work, giv­ing mo­men­tum to the Ja­panese govern­ment’s em­bry­onic ef­forts at fos­ter­ing work-life bal­ance and woo­ing mothers back to the work­force.</p>
    <p>This is sig­nif­i­cant for a coun­try known for its nox­iously ex­ces­sive over­time and low pro­duc­tiv­ity, hav­ing long been wed­ded to the work cul­ture of putting in face time in the of­fice.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ees are now l ib­er­ated from the watch­ful eyes of their su­pe­ri­ors and the pressure of at­tend­ing after-work nomikais (drink­ing par­ties), al­low­ing them to re­claim their per­sonal time.</p>
    <p>Mothers can more eas­ily go back to work while rais­ing their chil­dren, with the of­fice just a Zoom call away.</p>
    <p>A roll call of Ja­panese com­pa­nies keep­ing in place the “new nor­mal” in­cludes elec­tron­ics firms Fu­jitsu, Hi­tachi and Ri­coh, build­ing ma­te­ri­als group Lixil, and glass man­u­fac­turer AGC, in ad­di­tion to the Tokyo metropoli­tan govern­ment.</p>
    <p>As many em­ploy­ees no longer have to phys­i­cally re­port to work ev­ery day, with meet­ings done on Zoom, densely pop­u­lated Tokyo has seen its res­i­dent num­bers drop for five months and count­ing.</p>
    <p>Among those who have left is Ms Nanami Taka­hashi, 24, who moved in last month with her grand­par­ents in Ya­manashi. She started work in Au­gust as an IT engi­neer at tech firm Head­wa­ters, which has adopted work-from-home poli­cies since the start of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“I was wor­ried that I would not be able to adapt to my new work­place due to the lack of face-to­face meet­ings,” she told The Straits Times. “But reg­u­lar ‘re­mote lunches’ and ‘re­mote gen­eral meet­ings’ have eased my fears of not be­ing able to meet or com­mu­ni­cate with my co-work­ers.”</p>
    <p>She added: “I hate how Covid-19 has caused ma­jor dis­rup­tions to life as we know it, but it is also thanks to Covid-19 that there is now di­ver­sity in the way we work.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">The Straits&#xD;&#xA;Times part&#xAD;nered mu&#xAD;sic vet&#xAD;eran Cle&#xAD;ment Chow (above, left) and other lo&#xAD;cal artists (above) to turn a well-known Na&#xAD;tional Day song into a ral&#xAD;ly&#xAD;ing call for Sin&#xAD;ga&#xAD;pore&#xAD;ans to do their part in the fight against the Covid-19 pan&#xAD;demic, as well as raise funds for those af&#xAD;fected by the cri&#xAD;sis. The video, Stay At Home, Sin&#xAD;ga&#xAD;pore, re&#xAD;leased in April, was recorded and edited vir&#xAD;tu&#xAD;ally, with the help of videoconfe&#xAD;rencing soft&#xAD;ware.</p>
