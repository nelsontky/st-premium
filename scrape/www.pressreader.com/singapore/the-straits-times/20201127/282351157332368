    <p>Sal­adS­top cus­tomers who have is­sues with the or­der­ing app might be vo­cal, while de­liv­ery driv­ers who have a hard time find­ing pickup points might vent their frus­tra­tion on ground staff.</p>
    <p>But feed­back like this, which could help the salad shop chain im­prove ef­forts to sat­isfy its cus­tomers – and po­ten­tially stop rev­enue from drop­ping – may not have reached the cor­po­rate of­fice if it is not flagged in a sys­tem­atic way.</p>
    <p>With this in mind, the com­pany’s staff at­tended a pi­lot pro­gramme ear­lier this month, called the Busi­ness Value of De­sign.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the pro­gramme was of­fi­cially launched by the DesignSing­apore Coun­cil (DSG) in part­ner­ship with busi­ness strat­egy and de­sign firm McKin­sey De­sign.</p>
    <p>McKin­sey De­sign is the de­sign arm of Amer­i­can man­age­ment con­sult­ing firm McKin­sey, while DSG is a sub­sidiary of the Economic De­vel­op­ment Board.</p>
    <p>The scheme uses a de­sign think­ing ap­proach to come up with so­lu­tions to im­prove a firm’s bot­tom line.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the pro­gramme, Sal­adS­top tweaked its pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>Now, rec­om­men­da­tions from man­agers on how cus­tomer ex­pe­ri­ence can be boosted are sur­faced to the cor­po­rate of­fice on a weekly ba­sis, in­stead of on an ad hoc ba­sis, said the firm’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Adrien Des­bail­lets yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>More com­pa­nies like Sal­adS­top that are look­ing to im­prove and trans­form how they do busi­ness amid the chal­lenges posed by the pan­demic can now tap the ex­per­tise of con­sul­tants from McKin­sey De­sign un­der the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>It con­sists of two phases, the first of which is free.</p>
    <p>First, a firm will un­der­take a self­assess­ment us­ing the McKin­sey De­sign In­dex on­line tool.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies will re­ceive a de­tailed di­ag­no­sis of how they have in­cor­po­rated good de­sign into their busi­ness pro­cesses, while gain­ing an in­sight on how to im­prove their busi­ness per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>The as­sess­ment takes about 45 min­utes to com­plete. Firms can do it any time from now till Dec 31.</p>
    <p>The in­dex is a met­ric that rates com­pa­nies ac­cord­ing to four core ar­eas that are linked to im­proved fi­nan­cial per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>They in­clude user ex­pe­ri­ence, where prod­ucts are de­signed to pro­vide mean­ing­ful and rel­e­vant ex­pe­ri­ences to users, and hav­ing cross-func­tional teams, where firms recog­nise that user-cen­tric de­sign is ev­ery­one’s re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond phase of the pro­gramme, which is sub­sidised by DSG, will cost $2,500.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts from McKin­sey De­sign will guide firms to take prac­ti­cal steps to ad­dress ar­eas of im­prove­ment that have been flagged, cul­mi­nat­ing in a de­tailed busi­ness plan for a key prod­uct or ser­vice.</p>
    <p>These hands-on ses­sions will likely take place on­line.</p>
    <p>The first phase is open to all com­pa­nies, with se­lected com­pa­nies in­vited to par­tic­i­pate in the sec­ond phase from Jan 25 to Feb 5 next year. Up to 100 com­pa­nies can take part in the sec­ond phase and, if de­mand is healthy, more spa­ces can be opened up in sub­se­quent rounds, said Mr Mark Wee, DSG’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>He added that DSG felt it was timely to launch this scheme now that firms are in the midst of reimag­in­ing their busi­ness mod­els.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one has been forced onto the dig­i­tal band­wagon and forced to re­think what cus­tomers need now...</p>
    <p>“It helps to give them a con­crete in­di­ca­tor of what they need to do (to reach out to cus­tomers).”</p>
    <p>In­ter­ested firms can go to this web­site to sign up for the pro­gramme:</p>
