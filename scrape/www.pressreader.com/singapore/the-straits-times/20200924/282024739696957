    <p>While no­body knows how long it will take for the global econ­omy to re­cover from the im­pact of the pan­demic, many ob­servers pre­dict that firms will ac­cel­er­ate their ef­forts to dig­i­talise, au­to­mate and down­size, thereby ham­per­ing a job mar­ket that was al­ready show­ing signs of weak­ness be­fore the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>In an at­tempt to as­sist mid-ca­reer job seek­ers in an in­creas­ingly tight and con­tested labour mar­ket, some coun­tries have made dig­i­tal up­skilling and reskilling a core part of their Covid-19 re­lief pack­ages.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, as part of four sup­ple­men­tary Bud­gets worth al­most $100 bil­lion (20 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct) in to­tal, is sub­si­dis­ing six to 12 months of full-time train­ing for 30,000 lo­cal work­ers. Curricula are de­signed in part­ner­ship with in­dus­try and in­clude Python pro­gram­ming, data an­a­lyt­ics, Web and mo­bile ap­pli­ca­tion de­vel­op­ment, and data pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Com­mis­sion, through its “Skills Agenda” for “green and dig­i­tal tran­si­tions”, aims to in­crease the share of adults in the Euro­pean Union hav­ing at least ba­sic dig­i­tal skills from 56 per cent cur­rently to 70 per cent by 2025, and has said it will pri­ori­tise in­vest­ment in skills as part of its bud­get and re­cov­ery plan.</p>
    <p>But how ef­fec­tive are such at­tempts to reskill the work­force?</p>
    <p>THE RACE BE­TWEEN TECH­NOL­OGY AND ED­U­CA­TION</p>
    <p>To be sure, there are mer­its to hav­ing a higher-skilled work­force. It al­lows firms to im­prove lev­els and qual­ity of pro­duc­tion, which in turn sus­tains national eco­nomic growth. As high-skill jobs are usu­ally bet­ter paid, in­di­vid­u­als can re­cover the tu­ition and op­por­tu­nity cost of ter­tiary ed­u­ca­tion through in­creased life­time earn­ings. In other words, there is a pos­i­tive “re­turn to ed­u­ca­tion”.</p>
    <p>One rea­son why higher skills com­mand a pre­mium in the labour mar­ket is that tech­no­log­i­cal change is bi­ased to­wards high-skill work­ers. New tech­nolo­gies in the work­place (for ex­am­ple, of­fice pro­duc­tiv­ity soft­ware or “big data” ar­chi­tec­ture) in­crease the de­mand for more ed­u­cated work­ers whose skills en­able them to use and ap­ply those tools.</p>
    <p>The con­cept of a “race be­tween tech­nol­ogy and ed­u­ca­tion” (as de­scribed in a 2008 book by Dr Clau­dia Goldin and Dr Lawrence Katz), in which tech­no­log­i­cal change shapes the de­mand for skills, which then have to be sup­plied by ed­u­ca­tion, has been in­flu­en­tial in pol­i­cy­mak­ing and cur­ricu­lum de­sign.</p>
    <p>Skills train­ing is thus viewed as a rel­a­tively sim­ple, in­ex­pen­sive and un­con­tro­ver­sial pol­icy tool to sat­isfy the de­mand for high-skill labour. But how ef­fec­tive is it in pre­par­ing the lo­cal work­force for the wider struc­tural changes of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and datafi­ca­tion, es­pe­cially in a world re­shaped by the Covid-19 pan­demic?</p>
    <p>THE GLOBAL AUC­TION</p>
    <p>One ef­fect of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion is that jobs can be per­formed glob­ally, ex­pos­ing do­mes­tic work­ers to global com­pe­ti­tion that can drive wages down.</p>
    <p>In their book The Global Auc­tion, so­cial sci­en­tists Phillip Brown, Hugh Lauder and David Ash­ton show how the rise of a highly ed­u­cated and low-wage work­force in emerg­ing mar­kets has al­lowed transna­tional firms to ex­ert greater pres­sure on the salaries of do­mes­tic em­ploy­ees. In ad­di­tion, helped by ad­vances in in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy, firms have gone to great lengths to stan­dard­ise and cod­ify knowl­edge work, lay­ing the ba­sis for off­shoring.</p>
    <p>While off­shoring was ini­tially lim­ited to the back of­fice, it has since moved up the value chain to in­clude func­tions like re­search, mar­ket­ing and de­sign.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the au­thors, this is to be ex­pected: “If knowl­edge is a key source of com­pany profit, then the task of busi­ness is not to pay more for it but to pay less.”</p>
    <p>In a global econ­omy in which knowl­edge work has been trans­lated into work­ing knowl­edge, skills no longer mat­ter that much. Even high-skill jobs are sold to the low­est bid­der in a “re­verse auc­tion”.</p>
    <p>As they did af­ter the 2007-2008 global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, large transna­tional com­pa­nies are once again re­spond­ing to a cri­sis by squeez­ing wages, drop­ping ben­e­fits and down­grad­ing work­ing con­di­tions through labour ar­bi­trage (mov­ing jobs to lower-cost coun­tries) and au­to­ma­tion. Ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) tech­nol­ogy, which has made sub­stan­tial im­prove­ments in the 10 years since the last cri­sis, will play an im­por­tant role in these ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Un­like pre­vi­ous tools, which dig­i­talised man­ual work­flows and pa­per trails, AI as­pires to au­to­mate cog­ni­tive tasks. It is al­ready show­ing promis­ing re­sults in nar­row fields such as im­age and speech recog­ni­tion, trans­la­tion and fore­cast­ing.</p>
    <p>What im­pact will AI have on work in the 21st cen­tury? Re­search sug­gests that be­tween 10 per cent and 50 per cent of jobs are at risk of be­ing dis­placed by AI.</p>
    <p>In a re­cent Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment study, the es­ti­mated mean prob­a­bil­ity of au­to­ma­tion ranged from 28 per cent (for teach­ing pro­fes­sion­als) to 64 per cent (for food prepa­ra­tion as­sis­tants). Man­agers and ex­ec­u­tives were at the lower end (30 per cent to 32 per cent).</p>
    <p>Just to be clear, this does not im­ply that 30 per cent of man­agers will be out of work. It means that 30 per cent of the tasks that con­sti­tute the job of a typ­i­cal man­ager are in prin­ci­ple au­tomat­able, given cur­rent state-of-the-art tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Work­ers will of course ad­just to this new en­vi­ron­ment. Some will have to re­train or switch ca­reers. Some will be forced into low-paid and pre­car­i­ous em­ploy­ment, or be out of work al­to­gether. Oth­ers will cap­ture op­por­tu­ni­ties from newly cre­ated job roles, aug­mented by AI.</p>
    <p>While the net im­pact of AI is dif­fi­cult to es­ti­mate, the threat of ris­ing tech­ni­cal un­em­ploy­ment and un­der­em­ploy­ment is con­cern­ing.</p>
    <p>DE­CLIN­ING ROLE OF CRE­DEN­TIALS</p>
    <p>Will dig­i­tal up­skilling and reskilling help to cush­ion the blow of fur­ther down­siz­ing and au­to­ma­tion?</p>
    <p>As pro­fes­sors Brown, Lauder and Ash­ton write, we are wit­ness­ing “a fun­da­men­tal shift of power in the global econ­omy that can­not be re­solved through the job mar­ket no mat­ter how much money is pumped into de­vel­op­ing the skills of the... work­force”.</p>
    <p>In other words, it is highly un­likely that im­proved dig­i­tal skills will be of help to the in­di­vid­ual who is con­fronted with stan­dard­i­s­a­tion of knowl­edge work, labour ar­bi­trage, deskilling and fi­nally au­to­ma­tion through AI.</p>
    <p>What is more, a re­cent anal­y­sis of the Bri­tish labour mar­ket sug­gests that, for most jobs, cre­den­tials now play a rel­a­tively mi­nor role in dif­fer­en­ti­at­ing can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers in­stead de­mand “job readi­ness”. They ex­pect new hires to be pro­duc­tive from day one, with min­i­mal train­ing. This in turn in­creases the pres­sure on ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions to de­velop not just de­gree hold­ers but “mar­ketable skills”.</p>
    <p>Whether tech­ni­cal cer­tifi­cates in ar­eas such as data an­a­lyt­ics or ma­chine learn­ing, ob­tained in a day or in a few months from one of the many ac­cred­ited train­ing providers that have sprung up in re­cent years, will be con­sid­ered “mar­ketable” enough by po­ten­tial em­ploy­ers re­mains to be seen.</p>
    <p>One sil­ver lin­ing is that ex­perts in data en­gi­neer­ing, ma­chine learn­ing, cy­ber se­cu­rity, pri­vacy, ro­bot­ics and other emerg­ing fields con­tinue to be in high de­mand. In the EU alone, there is a gap of al­most 300,000 cy­ber se­cu­rity pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>How­ever, get­ting into these jobs and ac­quir­ing the req­ui­site work ex­pe­ri­ence takes years. Be­sides, some stu­dents are sim­ply not in­ter­ested in be­com­ing data spe­cial­ists or com­puter pro­gram­mers, even though some coun­tries, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, have made cod­ing classes manda­tory in pri­mary school.</p>
    <p>POL­ICY OP­TIONS</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal skills are not just about mas­ter­ing the lat­est of­fice tools, but also about so­cial in­clu­sion.</p>
    <p>Pri­vate- and pub­lic-sec­tor in­vest­ments in up­skilling and reskilling should thus be ap­plauded. At the same time, they are un­likely to pro­tect work­ers from the ef­fects of au­to­ma­tion, stan­dard­i­s­a­tion and down­grad­ing through tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The so-called “gig econ­omy”, in which hu­man work­ers are es­sen­tially man­aged and con­trolled by al­go­rithms, por­tends a par­tic­u­larly ex­treme and bleak fu­ture for the ser­vice econ­omy as a whole.</p>
    <p>Even in a world that is in­creas­ingly me­di­ated and ex­pe­ri­enced through dig­i­tal chan­nels, hu­mans still crave off­line com­mu­ni­ca­tion, so­cial in­ter­ac­tion and the free­dom to think and cre­ate. As em­ploy­ees, they are drawn to firms that use tech­nol­ogy to re­move the drudgery of repet­i­tive tasks while giv­ing them per­mis­sion to think and solve com­plex prob­lems. As con­sumers, they seek ex­pe­ri­ences that are per­sonal and authen­tic.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies that are nim­ble and per­cep­tive enough to recog­nise these needs can build a strate­gic ad­van­tage over the be­he­moths that sim­ply go down the path of fur­ther au­to­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>A sim­i­lar op­por­tu­nity presents it­self to gov­ern­ments, es­pe­cially those with lim­ited natural re­sources like Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Rather than ca­pit­u­lat­ing to the slow de­cline of low-pro­duc­tiv­ity ser­vice jobs, they should demon­strate lead­er­ship and fore­sight by iden­ti­fy­ing and sup­port­ing re­search clus­ters that rep­re­sent fu­ture sources of high-skill em­ploy­ment: nan­otech­nol­ogy, bio­med­i­cal en­gi­neer­ing, re­new­able en­ergy, ver­ti­cal farm­ing and oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, through dig­i­tally trans­form­ing the hu­man health and res­i­den­tial care sec­tors, which will grow as the pop­u­la­tion ages, the Government can cre­ate new types of jobs that are both high-tech and high-touch.</p>
    <p>In­vest­ing in re­search, health and care, along with a solid ed­u­ca­tional cur­ricu­lum in sci­ence and en­gi­neer­ing, seems the best strat­egy to re­store com­pet­i­tive­ness in the global knowl­edge econ­omy.</p>

He has worked in strat­egy con­sult­ing, bank­ing and risk man­age­ment in Europe and the United States, and was di­rec­tor of data and an­a­lyt­ics at PwC Sin­ga­pore.</p>
