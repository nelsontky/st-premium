    <p>To­day’s Uefa Su­per Cup match be­tween Cham­pi­ons League win­ners Bay­ern Mu­nich and Europa League hold­ers Sevilla would in nor­mal cir­cum­stances be an at­trac­tive show­piece clash be­tween two teams en­joy­ing a re­mark­able run of form.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean and Ger­man cham­pi­ons Bay­ern are un­beaten since Dec 7, a run of 31 com­pet­i­tive games which has seen them hu­mil­i­ate sev­eral op­po­nents, in­clud­ing an 8-2 rout of Barcelona, on their way to com­plet­ing a sec­ond tre­ble.</p>
    <p>Sevilla’s form has been al­most as im­pres­sive with no de­feats since Feb 9 – a run of 21 matches – as they fin­ished their sea­son by win­ning a record sixth Europa League.</p>
    <p>But the main in­ter­est is likely to re­volve around the game’s sta­tus as a test event for the re­turn of fans to sta­di­ums.</p>
    <p>Although some coun­tries have be­gun al­low­ing spec­ta­tors back in small num­bers, to­day’s match in Hun­gary – which acts as the cur­tain raiser for Euro­pean com­pe­ti­tion – is far riskier.</p>
    <p>Uefa and lo­cal au­thor­i­ties have al­lowed fans to fill up to 20,000 of the Puskas Arena’s 67,000 seats.</p>
    <p>There will, how­ever, be far more lo­cal sup­port­ers than away fans of both clubs, with many opt­ing not to travel amid the Ger­man government’s dec­la­ra­tion that Bu­dapest was a Covid-19 red zone.</p>
    <p>Ref­er­enc­ing the Aus­trian ski re­sort of Ischgl, where thou­sands of hol­i­day­mak­ers were in­fected with the virus at the out­set of the pan­demic in Europe, Bay­ern chair­man Karl-Heinz Rum­menigge warned that those at­tend­ing in per­son would be tak­ing a big risk.</p>
    <p>“I think ev­ery­one’s stom­achs are churn­ing. The game will take place in a city with a rate of in­fec­tion of over 100 (per 100,000 i nhab­i­tants), which is twice as high as that in Mu­nich,” he told Ger­man broad­caster ZDF.</p>
    <p>Bay­ern coach Hansi Flick is equally un­con­vinced by the safety mea­sures and given that his side have barely had a break – the Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal was only a month ago – he would have pre­ferred if the match was post­poned.</p>
    <p>He said: “It’s some­thing that we don’t re­ally un­der­stand. It’s not a de­ci­sion we have taken – it’s been taken by oth­ers.”</p>
