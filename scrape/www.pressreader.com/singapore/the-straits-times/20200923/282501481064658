    <p>Three years af­ter gam­ing hard­ware com­pany Razer made the first one, gam­ing smart­phones re­main a niche de­vice.</p>
    <p>But while Razer seems to have bowed out of this seg­ment, Asus con­tin­ues to push the bound­aries with its ROG Phone series of gam­ing smart­phones.</p>
    <p>The lat­est ROG Phone 3 of­fers sev­eral in­cre­men­tal up­grades over its pre­de­ces­sor.</p>
    <p>Its 6.59-inch dis­play now has a 144Hz re­fresh rate, up from 120Hz in the pre­vi­ous model. A high re­fresh rate makes games feel more fluid and smooth, though the jump from here is so slight that I can­not tell the dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The pro­ces­sor, too, has been re­freshed with the Qual­comm Snap­dragon 865 Plus chip, which is slightly faster than the stan­dard non-Plus edi­tion found in most flag­ship An­droid smart­phones.</p>
    <p>This chip is 5G-com­pat­i­ble and should work with lo­cal 5G net­works.</p>
    <p>With its cus­tom per­for­manceen­hanc­ing X Mode en­abled, the ROG Phone 3 scores 984 (sin­glecore) and 3,343 (multi-core) in the Geek­bench 5 bench­mark.</p>
    <p>These scores are bet­ter than those chalked up by the Sam­sung Galaxy Z Fold2 (973 for sin­gle-core; 2,858 for multi-core), which uses the same pro­ces­sor.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of rear cam­eras has gone up from two to three, with Asus adding a 5-megapixel (MP) macro cam­era for close-up shots.</p>
    <p>The pri­mary cam­era is now a 64MP one, up from 48MP pre­vi­ously, and there is also a 13MP ul­tra­w­ide cam­era.</p>
    <p>While these cam­eras are not as good as top smart­phone cam­eras, they are very de­cent. Pho­tos look crisp and have rel­a­tively lit­tle noise. Low-light per­for­mance is also pass­able.</p>
    <p>But these up­grades, while use­ful, are not why I con­sider the ROG Phone 3 one of the best gam­ing smart­phones in the mar­ket now.</p>
    <p>The key fea­ture of the ROG Phone series has been the pres­sure­sen­si­tive sen­sors (dubbed AirTrig­gers) that act like the shoul­der trig­ger but­tons on a game con­troller. These sen­sors, which vi­brate when tapped, can be mapped by users to their pre­ferred in-game con­trols.</p>
    <p>In the ROG Phone 3, the AirTrig­gers sup­port more ges­tures, such as slide and swipe.</p>
    <p>You still need to fid­dle around to find the right con­trol scheme for your games.</p>
    <p>This can be done by swip­ing left from the screen in games to bring up the Game Ge­nie – a handy float­ing tool­bar that lets you cus­tomise the AirTrig­gers – as well as a host of other gam­ing-cen­tric fea­tures, such as adding a crosshair or set­ting the screen re­fresh rate.</p>
    <p>An­other use­ful soft­ware tool in the ROG Phone 3 is the Asus Ar­moury Crate app, which mon­i­tors key met­rics like the tem­per­a­ture and clock speed of the phone’s pro­ces­sor and al­lows for cus­tomis­ing of fea­tures like the back­lit ROG logo at the back of the phone.</p>
    <p>Gamers will also ap­pre­ci­ate the app’s game rec­om­men­da­tions, which list ti­tles that sup­port the ROG Phone 3’s gam­ing fea­tures, like its 144Hz dis­play, AirTrig­gers and Asus’ dizzy­ing range of gam­ing ac­ces­sories.</p>
    <p>These ac­ces­sories, which in­clude a de­tach­able game con­troller and a dock with a sec­ond screen, are sold sep­a­rately. And be­cause the ROG Phone 3 has a sim­i­lar de­sign, the ac­ces­sories for last year’s ROG Phone 2 will work with the new model.</p>
    <p>The only ac­ces­sory that is not back­ward-com­pat­i­ble is the bun­dled AeroAc­tive Cooler 3 fan mod­ule, which con­nects to the two cus­tom USB-C ports on the left side of the ROG Phone 3 to keep it running cool even when you are play­ing graph­ics-heavy games.</p>
    <p>The new fan mod­ule in­cludes a 3.5mm head­phone jack, which has been re­moved from the ROG Phone 3 and a kick­stand that lets you place the phone on the ta­ble for watch­ing videos or gam­ing (with a sep­a­rate game con­troller).</p>
    <p>Weigh­ing around 240g, the ROG Phone 3 may lack flag­ship niceties like class-lead­ing cam­eras, wire­less charg­ing or wa­ter re­sis­tance, but its per­for­mance and gam­ing fea­tures make it the ideal smart­phone for mo­bile gamers.</p>
