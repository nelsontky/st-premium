    <p>As a re­sult of the Covid-19 pan­demic, 2020 has been a year marked by rapid dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion at an un­prece­dented pace.</p>
    <p>But this process has also come with in­creased cy­ber-se­cu­rity risks in the form of QR code scams, What­sApp hi­jack­ing and phish­ing e-mails, as hack­ers and scam­mers look to ex­ploit the op­por­tu­ni­ties that have opened up to them, with more com­pa­nies and in­di­vid­u­als go­ing on­line.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts speak­ing at a Straits Times we­bi­nar on dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and cy­ber se­cu­rity on Wed­nes­day warned of the dan­gers lurk­ing on­line and how to guard against them.</p>
    <p>Cy­ber Se­cu­rity Agency of Sin­ga­pore (CSA) chief ex­ec­u­tive David Koh, who was among the four pan­el­lists, noted that the agency han­dled 60 ran­somware cases from Jan­uary to Oc­to­ber, al­most twice the 35 cases re­ported last year.</p>
    <p>Ran­somware is mal­ware that in­fects un­pro­tected com­put­ers and locks them down with a note de­mand­ing ran­som.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh said: “Our depen­dence now on dig­i­tal in­fra­struc­ture (such as) smart­phones and com­put­ers has gone up tremen­dously (be­cause of Covid-19). It also means that the cy­ber-at­tack sur­face – the an­gles at which the bad guys, the ma­li­cious ac­tors, the crooks can at­tack us – has gone up as well.</p>
    <p>“We see many themes in phish­ing e-mails, many of them about Covid-19. I fully ex­pect the crooks will now pivot and will be talk­ing about vac­cines next.”</p>
    <p>Mr Koh was joined at the we­bi­nar by As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Steven Wong from the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Chang Ee-Chien from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s School of Com­put­ing, and Mr Ben­jamin Ang, head of the Cy­ber and Home­land De­fence Pro­gramme at the Cen­tre of Ex­cel­lence for Na­tional Se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Mr Ang re­counted how – in his ca­pac­ity as an ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee mem­ber of the In­ter­net So­ci­ety’s Sin­ga­pore chap­ter – he once re­ceived a phish­ing e-mail that im­per­son­ated the so­ci­ety’s in­cum­bent pres­i­dent to ask the trea­surer to trans­fer some money out of a bank to pay a ven­dor.</p>
    <p>A phone call to the pres­i­dent con­firmed that no such e-mail had been sent, and the trans­ac­tion was aborted.</p>
    <p>Mr Ang said: “(It) comes down to the cul­ture in or­gan­i­sa­tions. Our or­gan­i­sa­tions need more dig­i­tal em­pa­thy.</p>
    <p>“Or­gan­i­sa­tions have to be able to say, ‘Okay, I’m go­ing to give space for you to stop and think be­fore we push the but­ton’. We don’t want to build a cul­ture where, the mo­ment I see an e-mail ask­ing me to trans­fer money, I do so straight­away.”</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, CSA launched its Safer Cy­berspace Mas­ter­plan to raise the gen­eral level of cy­ber se­cu­rity across Sin­ga­pore, in­clud­ing through free cy­ber-health screen­ings for busi­nesses, and the use of ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence to sniff out se­cu­rity threats in key in­fra­struc­ture, in­clud­ing broad­band and 5G net­works.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh likened what CSA is try­ing to do to how na­tional wa­ter agency PUB man­ages Sin­ga­pore’s wa­ter sup­ply.</p>
    <p>“The prob­lem to­day is that com­pa­nies and en­ter­prises are try­ing to purify their own wa­ter when it comes to cy­ber se­cu­rity, and so are in­di­vid­u­als, who are do­ing the equiv­a­lent of ty­ing a sock to the tap and hop­ing that it fil­ters the wa­ter to some ex­tent,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It will be more ef­fi­cient and ef­fec­tive if we (CSA) can do it up­stream, sim­i­lar to what PUB does for the real wa­ter sup­ply.”</p>
