    <p>Of the al­most 2,200 em­ploy­ers un­der re­view for sus­pected abuse of the Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS) in July, 444 have been de­nied pay­outs ei­ther par­tially or in full to the tune of al­most $10 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Four are un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion by the po­lice, said the In­land Rev­enue Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (Iras).</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, Iras said the em­ploy­ers un­der re­view will have their pay­outs with­held un­til they are able to submit sup­port­ing doc­u­ments to ver­ify the au­then­tic­ity and ac­cu­racy of manda­tory Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) con­tri­bu­tions made.</p>
    <p>Their pay­outs will be ad­justed or de­nied if is­sues or dis­crep­an­cies sur­face dur­ing the re­view, and egre­gious cases re­ferred to the po­lice.</p>
    <p>“This is part of Iras’ anti-gam­ing ef­forts to en­sure that JSS pay­outs are fairly and cor­rectly dis­bursed,” said Iras.</p>
    <p>The scheme, which com­prises wage sub­si­dies to help re­tain lo­cal work­ers, was re­cently ex­tended to cover wages paid up to March next year for firms in sec­tors harder hit by the Covid-19 cri­sis, and up to De­cem­ber this year for sec­tors which are man­ag­ing well.</p>
    <p>The sub­sidy ap­plies to the first $4,600 of gross monthly wages paid to each Singaporea­n or per­ma­nent res­i­dent em­ployee.</p>
    <p>As at last month, the author­ity had con­cluded a re­view of more than 1,400 em­ploy­ers. Close to 50 have vol­un­tar­ily de­clared in­cor­rect manda­tory em­ployee CPF con­tri­bu­tions. Their JSS pay­outs were ad­justed be­fore be­ing dis­bursed.</p>
    <p>“Ahead of the Oc­to­ber JSS pay­outs, em­ploy­ers are en­cour­aged to re­view the manda­tory CPF con­tri­bu­tions for em­ploy­ees to en­sure that they have con­trib­uted the ap­pro­pri­ate amount, based on ac­tual wages paid to bona fide em­ploy­ees,” said Iras.</p>
    <p>It also re­ceived more than 300 re­ports from whis­tle-blow­ers on em­ploy­ers sus­pected to have abused the scheme.</p>
    <p>The po­lice are in­ves­ti­gat­ing four sus­pected cases of em­ploy­ers who sub­mit­ted false doc­u­ments to sub­stan­ti­ate their el­i­gi­bil­ity for the JSS.</p>
    <p>The penalties in­clude be­ing charged un­der Sec­tion 420 of the Pe­nal Code and fac­ing up to 10 years in jail and a fine.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, Iras re­minded em­ploy­ers who made in­cor­rect manda­tory em­ployee CPF con­tri­bu­tions to de­clare and rec­tify the er­rors via the CPF On­line Ap­pli­ca­tion ser­vice by June 30. It had said that no ac­tion would be taken against them pro­vided the dis­clo­sure was ac­cu­rate and com­plete.</p>
