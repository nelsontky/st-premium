    <p>Park 22 Ho­tel Lit­tle In­dia: Cosy and sur­rounded by his­tory</p>
    <p>With a black-and-white fa­cade in­spired by colo­nial-era bun­ga­lows, Park 22 Ho­tel Lit­tle In­dia stands out from the riot of colour in its vi­brant sur­rounds.</p>
    <p>Owner Ng Aung San, who opened the ho­tel in 2016, has a soft spot for the ar­chi­tec­tural style.</p>
    <p>Vin­tage touches, such as rat­tan chairs and black-and-white pho­tos of colo­nial build­ings, adorn guest rooms.</p>
    <p>Water­colour paint­ings of shop­houses and more colo­nial ar­chi­tec­ture by lo­cal artist Davi Beschizza brighten up moody cor­ri­dors and stair­cases.</p>
    <p>So it’s cheap, but is it com­fort­able?</p>
    <p>My Ob­ser­va­tory Room over­looks a busy street, which re­mains bustling till around mid­night – fun for peo­ple-watch­ing, but not so great if you are try­ing to get some shut-eye.</p>
    <p>Thin walls mean you will hear slam­ming doors or tramp­ing down the stairs of this three-storey build­ing. Ask for a pair of com­pli­men­tary earplugs at the re­cep­tion.</p>
    <p>Rooms come with firm and soft pil­lows – a boon for those who need neck sup­port for a good sleep.</p>
    <p>Bath­rooms are cramped but clean; the wa­ter is hot and pres­sure strong. A bot­tle of sham­poocum-soap is pro­vided, but take along your own toi­letries for a more lux­u­ri­ant shower.</p>
    <p>What else is there to do?</p>
    <p>Awash in colour, the Tan Teng Niah house is just 20m away.</p>
    <p>The late Chi­nese busi­ness­man owned sev­eral con­fec­tionery fac­to­ries in Seran­goon Road and a rub­ber smoke-house in Ker­bau Road.</p>
    <p>His two-storey bun­ga­low built in 1900 is said to be the last re­main­ing Chi­nese villa in the area. Today, it makes an ef­fort­less In­sta­gram back­drop, though you may have to wait your turn while other In­sta­gram­mers preen and pose. Take along a tri­pod or a will­ing friend.</p>
    <p>More colour adorns the sur­round­ing build­ings, with mu­rals that il­lus­trate the area’s sto­ried past.</p>
    <p>A Ride Through Race Course Road by lo­cal artist Jax­ton Su shows a horse gal­lop­ing through a mar­ket – a nod to the horse-rac­ing track once lo­cated in the area. Other mu­rals de­pict tra­di­tional dancers and old trades­men such as astrologer­s and dho­bis, or laun­dry men.</p>
    <p>When the heat gets too much, duck into the air-con­di­tioned comfort of the In­dian Her­itage Cen­tre, South-east Asia’s first mu­seum to fo­cus on the In­dian di­as­pora.</p>
    <p>Arte­facts such as jew­ellery, stone sculp­tures and wood carv­ings tell the story of early In­dian pi­o­neers in Sin­ga­pore and Malaya, as well as the con­tri­bu­tions of the In­dian com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>En­try is free for Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>You’ve saved on a stay, now in­dulge in a good meal.</p>
    <p>Make reser­va­tions at Meat­smith Lit­tle In­dia, a five-minute walk away along Camp­bell Lane and an off­shoot of the Amer­i­can bar­be­cue restau­rant’s flag­ship joint in Telok Ayer. Eclec­tic and grungy, it serves mod­ern In­dian flavours.</p>
    <p>Dine al­fresco along a five-foot­way on the first floor. Or head up­stairs for head chef Kurt Som­brero’s ex­per­i­men­tal tast­ing menu, which was launched in July.</p>
    <p>The tast­ing menu ($85 or $150 with cock­tail pair­ings) in­cludes a cured Span­ish cara­binero prawn burst­ing with briny flavour, atop cau­li­flower puree and a pur­ple seaweed salad ($12, be­low left). A dol­lop of cur­ried granita – spicy, icy, savoury and in­trigu­ing – pulls the whole dish to­gether.</p>
    <p>More op­tions abound at Tekka mar­ket, in­clud­ing Sin­halese food from Rasa Raja Bo­jun and home­style prawn noo­dle soup from 545 Wham­poa Prawn Noo­dles.</p>
    <p>Wash the food down with a co­conut, fresh from sur­round­ing cof­fee shops and pro­duce stalls, for about $2.</p>
    <p>Ver­dict: Hid­den gem or bud­get disas­ter?</p>
    <p>For the price, this cosy ho­tel can’t be beat. While prices go up on week­ends and dur­ing school hol­i­days, the ho­tel says it will keep rates of Ob­ser­va­tory rooms to $100 when guests book via its Face­book page, as part of the Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers pro­gramme.</p>
