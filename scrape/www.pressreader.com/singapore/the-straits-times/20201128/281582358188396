    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s 85,000 civil ser­vants will not re­ceive any year-end bonus this year amid the eco­nomic fall­out from the Covid-19 pan­demic, the Pub­lic Ser­vice Di­vi­sion said. This means that they will not be re­ceiv­ing any an­nual vari­able com­po­nent pay­ment for the en­tire year as mid-year bonuses were also not paid out ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s 85,000 civil ser­vants will not re­ceive any year-end bonus this year amid the eco­nomic fall­out from the Covid-19 pan­demic, the Pub­lic Ser­vice Di­vi­sion (PSD) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This means that they will not be re­ceiv­ing any an­nual vari­able com­po­nent (AVC) pay­ment for the en­tire year as mid-year bonuses were also not paid out ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Gov­ern­ment will con­tinue to give spe­cial con­sid­er­a­tion to lower-wage civil ser­vants amid dif­fi­cult times, said the PSD.</p>
    <p>Around 2,400 civil ser­vants in lower pay grades will re­ceive a one­time lump sum pay­ment of $1,200.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment will also con­tinue to pay the non-pen­sion­able an­nual al­lowance – known as the 13th month bonus – of one month’s pay to all civil ser­vants.</p>
    <p>The PSD said this de­ci­sion – made in close con­sul­ta­tion with the pub­lic sec­tor unions – was taken in the light of the neg­a­tive eco­nomic out­look. It cited the pro­jected eco­nomic con­trac­tion of be­tween 6 per cent and 6.5 per cent for 2020.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Min­istry of Man­power’s pre­lim­i­nary es­ti­mates, the over­all, res­i­dent and cit­i­zen un­em­ploy­ment rates also rose in the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Most civil ser­vants will re­ceive less than they did dur­ing the 2009 global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, when Sin­ga­pore suf­fered neg­a­tive growth.</p>
    <p>Civil ser­vants re­ceived no AVC that year but only a one-off pay­ment of 0.25 month – capped at $750 – and the 13th month bonus.</p>
    <p>Last year, all civil ser­vants be­low su­per­scale grade re­ceived a yearend bonus of 0.1 month and an ad­di­tional one-off lump sum pay­ment of $250 to $1,500, amid the weak per­for­mance of the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy and its un­cer­tain out­look.</p>
    <p>Se­nior civil ser­vants in su­per­scale grades re­ceived a one-off pay­ment of $400 in­stead of the year-end AVC.</p>
    <p>This year, the PSD an­nounced in June that pub­lic of­fi­cers in su­per­scale grades will have a one-time 0.5-month or one-month pay cut in ac­cor­dance with their se­nior­ity. This was on top of the 0.5-month cut for of­fi­cers in key lead­er­ship po­si­tions an­nounced in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Ms Cham Hui Fong, deputy sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the Na­tional Trades Union Congress, said NTUC sup­ports the PSD’s de­ci­sion to not give a year-end bonus, in view of the weak eco­nomic per­for­mance this year.</p>
    <p>“We ap­pre­ci­ate that the Gov­ern­ment has taken the cue from the Na­tional Wages Coun­cil to ex­tend fi­nan­cial sup­port for our low­er­wage work­ers in the pub­lic ser­vice,” she said.</p>
    <p>She also called on pri­vate sec­tor com­pa­nies to pay spe­cial at­ten­tion to their lower-wage work­ers.</p>
    <p>As the civil ser­vice is Sin­ga­pore’s big­gest em­ployer, its bonus is closely watched by the pri­vate sec­tor, while statu­tory boards and other gov­ern­ment agen­cies take their cue from it.</p>
    <p>Mr Sim Gim Guan, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion, said pri­vate sec­tor em­ploy­ers should take into ac­count their com­pany’s per­for­mance when de­cid­ing on the com­pany bonus, and urged em­ploy­ers to give spe­cial con­sid­er­a­tion to lower-wage work­ers.</p>
    <p>He also en­cour­aged em­ploy­ers who pay the an­nual wage sup­ple­ment, or 13th month bonus, to en­deav­our to con­tinue do­ing so.</p>
    <p>The PSD added that the pub­lic sec­tor “stands in sol­i­dar­ity with Sin­ga­pore­ans in this chal­leng­ing eco­nomic en­vi­ron­ment”.</p>
    <p>“Our pub­lic of­fi­cers have gone above and be­yond the call of duty, and worked tire­lessly over many months, in the na­tional fight against Covid-19. The Gov­ern­ment deeply ap­pre­ci­ates the hard work of all pub­lic of­fi­cers,” it said.</p>
    <p>“The fight against Covid-19 con­tin­ues and the pub­lic ser­vice will con­tinue to work hard, hand in hand with our cit­i­zens and stake­hold­ers, to man­age the pan­demic and its eco­nomic ram­i­fi­ca­tions.”</p>
    <p>Some em­ploy­ers in the pri­vate sec­tor plan to not pay any bonuses to their staff this year. This is sim­i­lar to the Gov­ern­ment an­nounc­ing there would be no bonus paid to civil ser­vants at the year’s end, given the weak­ened eco­nomic out­look caused by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers, how­ever, are still go­ing ahead with plans to pay their staff a bonus on top of the an­nual wage sup­ple­ment, or 13th month bonus.</p>
    <p>Mr Nick Lee, direc­tor of IT ser­vices firm AIT Tech­nolo­gies, said his firm has been mak­ing a loss this year as client projects were de­layed amid the coro­n­avirus out­break. He will not be able to pay his staff an an­nual bonus or the 13th month bonus.</p>
    <p>“We al­ready had to let go two peo­ple ear­lier this year, but the ma­jor­ity of our staff have not had their salaries cut. Sav­ing our com­pany is the pri­or­ity now,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Kevin Cheong, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of lo­cal at­trac­tion Sen­tosa 4D Ad­ven­tureLand, also said it would not be pos­si­ble for him to pay a bonus to staff.</p>
    <p>“With as good as half the year’s in­come wiped out overnight, all of us are strug­gling, even after we have re­opened our doors to vis­i­tors.”</p>
    <p>Dr Cheong, who is also chair­man of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore At­trac­tions, said he would not be sur­prised to see most tourism op­er­a­tors do­ing the same.</p>
    <p>The two men were re­spond­ing to yes­ter­day’s an­nounce­ment by the Pub­lic Ser­vice Di­vi­sion (PSD) that Sin­ga­pore’s 85,000 civil ser­vants will not re­ceive any year-end bonus this year.</p>
    <p>This means they will not be re­ceiv­ing any an­nual vari­able com­po­nent for the en­tire year as midyear bonuses were also not paid out ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Civil ser­vants will still re­ceive the non-pen­sion­able an­nual al­lowance, or 13th month bonus, of one month’s pay.</p>
    <p>Mr Dainial Sani Lim, group direc­tor of im­mi­gra­tion con­sul­tancy Cay­man Group Hold­ings, will still be pay­ing the 13th month bonus to his staff, and also plans to con­tinue pay­ing an­nual per­for­mance bonuses.</p>
    <p>Though rev­enues have been slightly af­fected by Covid-19, his firm is not as hard-hit.</p>
    <p>“Our bonus is tied to our com­pany’s per­for­mance, but be­cause of Covid-19, I re­duced the group per­for­mance tar­get by about 20 per cent... If we hit this tar­get, we will still be able to give out bonuses,” said Mr Lim. “Even though times are dif­fi­cult, ev­ery­one still has to pay the bills.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ho Meng Kit, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Sin­ga­pore Business Fed­er­a­tion, said the pub­lic sec­tor’s non­pay­ment of the year-end bonus is a sig­nal for the pri­vate sec­tor to be pru­dent in man­ag­ing its wage costs. He noted that the out­look for busi­nesses over the next year re­mains highly un­cer­tain.</p>
    <p>“In view of (this), we would ex­pect busi­nesses to pri­ori­tise the man­age­ment of their wage costs,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the PSD said it will con­tinue to give spe­cial con­sid­er­a­tion to lower-wage civil ser­vants, with around 2,400 staff in lower pay grades re­ceiv­ing a one-time lump sum pay­ment of $1,200.</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­man Kathavaray­an, gen­eral sec­re­tary of the Amal­ga­mated Union of Pub­lic Daily Rated Work­ers, cheered the move to pro­vide this pay­ment to lower-wage work­ers as it would give them much­needed en­cour­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Sanjeev Ku­mar Ti­wari, gen­eral sec­re­tary of the Amal­ga­mated Union of Pub­lic Em­ploy­ees, said the union is ap­pre­cia­tive that the 13th month bonus has been main­tained for all pub­lic of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>A civil ser­vant in his 30s who de­clined to be named said he is not sur­prised at the news about the year-end bonus.</p>
    <p>“(This is) be­cause year-end bonuses have al­ways been tied to the econ­omy.” How­ever, he hopes that his per­for­mance bonus, which is paid out in March, will not be af­fected.</p>
