    <p>Trial data for As­traZeneca and Univer­sity of Ox­ford’s pos­si­ble coronaviru­s vac­cine could be given to reg­u­la­tors this year. The Bri­tish drug­maker also said it had be­gun a clin­i­cal trial of a drug de­signed to both pre­vent in­fec­tion and treat peo­ple with Covid-19, with the first vol­un­teers re­ceiv­ing doses.</p>
    <p>LON­DON • Trial data for the Univer­sity of Ox­ford and Bri­tish drug­maker As­traZeneca’s pos­si­ble coronaviru­s vac­cine could be given to reg­u­la­tors this year, but cor­ners can­not be cut to speed up ap­proval for emer­gency use, a sci­en­tist lead­ing the tri­als said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca also said yes­ter­day that it had be­gun a clin­i­cal trial of a drug de­signed to both pre­vent in­fec­tion and treat peo­ple with Covid-19, with the first vol­un­teers re­ceiv­ing doses.</p>
    <p>The Ox­ford vac­cine pro­duced an im­mune re­sponse in its first hu­man tri­als, un­der­lin­ing its po­si­tion as one of the lead­ing can­di­dates in the race to com­bat a virus that has led to more than 800,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>“It is just pos­si­ble that if the cases ac­crue rapidly in the clin­i­cal tri­als, that we could have that data be­fore reg­u­la­tors this year,” Pro­fes­sor An­drew Pol­lard, di­rec­tor of the Ox</p>
    <p>ford Vac­cine Group, told BBC Ra­dio of progress in larger, late-stage tri­als.</p>
    <p>“Then there would be a process that they go through in or­der to make a full as­sess­ment of the data.”</p>
    <p>The tri­als hit the head­lines ear­lier this week when t he Fi­nan­cial Times re­ported that the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion was con­sid­er­ing fast-track­ing the vac­cine for use in the United States ahead of the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>One op­tion be­ing ex­plored would in­volve the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion award­ing “emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion” in Oc­to­ber to the po­ten­tial vac­cine, the news­pa­per said.</p>
    <p>Prof Pol­lard said the process for emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion was well es­tab­lished. “But it still in­volves hav­ing care­fully con­ducted data... and ev­i­dence that it ac­tu­ally works,” he added.</p>
    <p>The Fi­nan­cial Times re­ported that Wash­ing­ton was con­sid­er­ing bas­ing emer­gency ap­proval of the vac­cine on just a small United King­dom study of about 10,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Prof Pol­lard, the chief in­ves­ti­ga­tor of the global clin­i­cal tri­als of the vac­cine can­di­date, said As­traZeneca would take the data to reg­u­la­tors once the sci­en­tists were sat­is­fied with it.</p>
    <p>He said Ox­ford had en­rolled about 20,000 peo­ple i n tri­als across Bri­tain, Brazil and South Africa, with As­traZeneca lead­ing a US trial of 30,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“The size of the tri­als still isn’t the is­sue here, what you need is to have enough cases ac­cru­ing dur­ing the time of ob­ser­va­tion in the tri­als,” Prof Pol­lard said.</p>
    <p>Be­sides ef­forts to create a vac­cine, As­traZeneca has also de­vel­oped the drug AZD7442, a com­bi­na­tion of two mon­o­clonal an­ti­bod­ies (mAbs), for the preven­tion and treat­ment of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The drug is be­ing tested on 48 healthy peo­ple aged between 18 and 55, the Lon­don-listed firm said.</p>
    <p>Devel­op­ment of mAbs to tar­get the virus has been en­dorsed by lead­ing sci­en­tists.</p>
    <p>The drug mim­ics nat­u­ral an­ti­bod­ies gen­er­ated in the body to fight off in­fec­tion and can be syn­the­sised in the lab­o­ra­tory to treat dis­eases in pa­tients. Cur­rent uses in­clude treat­ment of some types of can­cers.</p>
    <p>US in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert An­thony Fauci has called them “al­most a sure bet” against Covid-19, and As­traZeneca in June re­ceived US$23.7 mil­lion (S$32.4 mil­lion) in fund­ing from US gov­ern­ment agen­cies to ad­vance devel­op­ment of an­ti­body-based treat­ments for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“This com­bi­na­tion of an­ti­bod­ies, cou­pled with our pro­pri­etary halflife ex­ten­sion tech­nol­ogy, has the po­ten­tial to im­prove both the ef­fec­tive­ness and dura­bil­ity of use in ad­di­tion to re­duc­ing the like­li­hood of vi­ral re­sis­tance,” said Dr Mene Pan­ga­los, ex­ec­u­tive vice-pres­i­dent of bio­phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals re­search and devel­op­ment at As­traZeneca.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor An­drew Pol­lard, the chief in­ves­ti­ga­tor of the global clin­i­cal tri­als of the vac­cine can­di­date, said Ox­ford had en­rolled about 20,000 peo­ple in tri­als across Bri­tain, Brazil and South Africa, with As­traZeneca lead­ing a US trial of 30,000 peo­ple. “The size of the tri­als still isn’t the is­sue here, what you need is to have enough cases ac­cru­ing dur­ing the time of ob­ser­va­tion in the tri­als,” he said.</p>
