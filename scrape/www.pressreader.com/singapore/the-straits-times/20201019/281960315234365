    <p>In a cer­e­mony steeped in tra­di­tion, the Rev­erend Canon Dr Ti­tus Chung was in­stalled as the new bishop of the Angli­can Church in Sin­ga­pore yes­ter­day evening. The 21/ hour-long service at St An­drew’s Cathe­dral</p>
    <p>2 was a muted af­fair, ow­ing to Covid-19 re­stric­tions. Only about 100 peo­ple – the max­i­mum al­lowed un­der cur­rent so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules – at­tended the cer­e­mony, com­pared with thou­sands who showed up on past oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>How­ever, more than 2,000 peo­ple fol­lowed the pro­ceed­ings, which were live-streamed on YouTube. Politi­cians and lead­ers of other Chris­tian de­nom­i­na­tions were present at the cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob and her hus­band Mo­hamed Ab­dul­lah Al­hab­shee both at­tended, as did for­mer pres­i­dent Tony Tan Keng Yam and his wife Mary, who are both Angli­cans.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers present in­cluded Min­is­ter for Home Af­fairs and Law K. Shan­mugam, For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan, Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Min­is­ter Ed­win Tong and Catholic Arch­bishop Wil­liam Goh.</p>
    <p>Bishop Chung, who is mar­ried with two chil­dren, is the 10th bishop of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The 55-year-old was pre­vi­ously pri­est-in-charge of St An­drew’s Cathe­dral’s Man­darin con­gre­ga­tion and takes over as bishop from Right Rev­erend Ren­nis Pon­niah, 65, who re­tired last month.</p>
    <p>Though yes­ter­day’s cer­e­mony was scaled down, it was no less im­pres­sive, open­ing with a pro­ces­sion of Angli­can clergy mem­bers from Sin­ga­pore stream­ing into the nave in their re­splen­dent robes.</p>
    <p>The Right Rev­erend Dr John Chew, who was the eighth Angli­can bishop of Sin­ga­pore, then led the con­se­cra­tion pro­ceed­ings, pray­ing over Bishop Chung with other bish­ops be­fore pass­ing to him his sym­bols of of­fice: a Bi­ble to guide him, a ring which sig­ni­fies faith and a Mitre, the bishop’s head­dress.</p>
    <p>Sub­se­quently, the in­stal­la­tion por­tion of the service be­gan with Bishop Chung ex­it­ing the sanc­tu­ary and other church lead­ers clos­ing the en­trance doors.</p>
    <p>The bishop then had to knock on the door three times with his staff and wait for per­mis­sion to be granted by the Church for him to en­ter, sig­nalling ac­cep­tance from the Church.</p>
    <p>When the doors were opened, the bishop was led to the cathe­dra, or bishop’s throne, be­hind the al­tar, where Bishop Chew handed him the Dioce­san Crosier, or bishop’s staff, sym­bolic of the pass­ing of lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>Angli­can clergy from the re­gion, in­clud­ing Malaysia, who were un­able to travel to Sin­ga­pore for the service, con­veyed their con­grat­u­la­tory mes­sages via videos, which were screened dur­ing the service.</p>
    <p>The newly in­stalled bishop, who holds a doc­tor­ate in phi­los­o­phy from the Univer­sity of Ed­in­burgh, was or­dained as a pri­est in 1997 af­ter grad­u­at­ing from Trin­ity The­o­log­i­cal Col­lege. He served as pri­est and sub­se­quently vicar at the Chapel of the Holy Spirit from 1997 to 2005, be­fore join­ing St An­drew’s Cathe­dral in 2009.</p>
    <p>He told The Straits Times af­ter the service that he felt “the heavy weight of the re­spon­si­bil­ity” of his new role amid the Covid-19 cri­sis. The dio­cese, he said, would look into sup­port­ing the so­cial, men­tal and psy­cho­log­i­cal needs of both its flock and the wider com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“The Chris­tian faith is not just about serv­ing Chris­tians and serv­ing the church, but also about serv­ing the na­tion. We want to ex­tend that love and care to one an­other, es­pe­cially those who are in need of help” he added.</p>
    <p>There are about 22,000 Angli­cans in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
