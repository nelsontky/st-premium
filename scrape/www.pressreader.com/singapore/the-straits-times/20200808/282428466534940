    <p>• Bay­ern Mu­nich are hop­ing Cham­pi­ons League suc­cess can con­vince Thi­ago Al­can­tara and David Alaba, who are stalling over ex­ten­sions, to stay.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man cham­pi­ons host Chelsea at the Al­lianz Arena to­day, hold­ing a 3-0 lead ahead of the sec­ond leg of their last-16 Cham­pi­ons League tie.</p>
    <p>The Bavar­ian giants have al­ready se­cured their eighth straight Bun­desliga ti­tle and the Ger­man Cup, putting them on course for their sec­ond-ever tre­ble. They are also on an 11-game win­ning run since the do­mes­tic league restarted in May.</p>
    <p>Chelsea are without for­wards Chris­tian Pulisic, who in­jured his ham­string in the FA Cup fi­nal de­feat by Arse­nal, and Pe­dro, who not only suf­fered a dis­lo­cated shoul­der at Wem­b­ley but is also join­ing Roma on a free trans­fer.</p>
    <p>Blues skip­per Ce­sar Azpilicuet­a is also ex­pected to miss the Mu­nich match through in­jury.</p>
    <p>Bay­ern’s per­son­nel con­cerns are dif­fer­ent. Al­can­tara, who has been linked to Liver­pool, and Alaba, have one year left on their con­tracts and have put talks on hold.</p>
    <p>Bay­ern chair­man Karl-Heinz Rum­menigge hinted Al­can­tara “wants to do something new”, but no of­fers have been made for the 29-year-old.</p>
    <p>He also made it clear that “de­spite the coro­n­avirus, there will not be a sum­mer sale at Bay­ern”, so the pair will not be leav­ing on the cheap. Re­ports i ndi­cate a €30 mil­lion (S$48.6 mil­lion) price tag for Al­can­tara, while Alaba is ex­pected to cost sig­nif­i­cantly more.</p>
