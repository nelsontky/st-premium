    <p>The in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion rep­re­sents an op­por­tu­nity for the US to en­gage China con­struc­tively, work­ing on ar­eas of com­mon in­ter­est while con­strain­ing the ar­eas where they dis­agree, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said at a Bloomberg fo­rum yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He ex­pressed hope that Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den will seek such a frame­work for ties with Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>On Mr Bi­den’s pledge to con­vene a global sum­mit of democ­ra­cies in the first year of his pres­i­dency, PM Lee said most coun­tries want to work with the US but few would be will­ing to join a coali­tion that ex­cludes play­ers like China. All coun­tries should be in­volved in work­ing out ad­just­ments to the world or­der, he said. In the process, al­liances will form and co­op­er­a­tion will take place, he added. “But to try and make a line-up, Cold War-style, I do not think that is on the cards.”</p>
    <p>Asia – and es­pe­cially China – is an im­por­tant part of the world for Amer­ica, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong yes­ter­day, ex­press­ing his hope that US Pres­i­den­t­elect Joe Bi­den will de­velop a frame­work for an over­all con­struc­tive relationsh­ip with Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>This means a relationsh­ip in which both pow­ers re­main in com­pe­ti­tion with is­sues to re­solve, but ul­ti­mately do not want to col­lide and will work to de­velop ar­eas of com­mon in­ter­ests while con­strain­ing the ar­eas of dis­agree­ment, he said at the Bloomberg New Econ­omy Fo­rum, which is be­ing held vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>Within this frame­work, top­ics such as trade, se­cu­rity, cli­mate change, nu­clear non-pro­lif­er­a­tion and the is­sue of North Korea can be dealt with, he added.</p>
    <p>He also ex­pressed the hope that the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion, un­der the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion, will no longer be “de­lib­er­ately pushed to one side” in the way it has been un­der the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries may quar­rel over many things, but they should try to “in­su­late” trade be­cause trade dis­putes hurt all par­ties in­volved, he said.</p>
    <p>“The more coun­tries avoid do­ing that, the more it will be cred­i­ble when they say we be­lieve in mul­ti­lat­eral trade, and they be­lieve in win-win de­vel­op­ment and co­op­er­a­tion with our neigh­bours.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee was speak­ing to Bloomberg News editor-in-chief John Mick­leth­wait in a wide-rang­ing in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>Asked if Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has done “per­ma­nent dam­age” to the way the United States is viewed in the re­gion, PM Lee said there will be some long-term im­pact on how Amer­ica is viewed, as well as how it views it­self. Although the shift in per­spec­tive did not start with Mr Trump, it has be­come more ev­i­dent in the last four years, he added.</p>
    <p>“When you talk about putting Amer­ica first and mak­ing Amer­ica great again, it is a more nar­row def­i­ni­tion of where Amer­ica’s in­ter­ests lie than has hitherto been the way US ad­min­is­tra­tions have seen things,” PM Lee said.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ous ad­min­is­tra­tions took a broad in­ter­est in the re­gion’s sta­bil­ity and the well-be­ing of the coun­try’s part­ners, he noted. It tended its al­liances, fos­ter­ing an or­derly en­vi­ron­ment and sub­ject­ing it­self to the same rules.</p>
    <p>“It will take some time for Amer­ica to come back to such a po­si­tion, and for oth­ers to be con­vinced that it is tak­ing such a po­si­tion,” PM Lee said. “It may never come back all the way, cer­tainly in the short term and cer­tainly in terms of its relationsh­ip with China.”</p>
    <p>But he also noted Mr Bi­den knows Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping very well. “That per­sonal en­gage­ment at the top is im­por­tant,” he said, when asked how Mr Bi­den might deal with China on is­sues like hu­man rights.</p>
    <p>Equally im­por­tant is how each coun­try sees the other and the in­ten­tions of the other, he added.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese, for their part, do not want a col­li­sion with Amer­ica. But at the same time, PM Lee said, “I am not sure that they are pre­pared to give a lot of ground.”</p>
    <p>China is likely to hold the view that its grow­ing af­flu­ence and power have re­sulted in a win-win sit­u­a­tion for the world, he said. “Things have got­ten bet­ter, yet many coun­tries do feel that things do need to be ad­justed. That ad­just­ment will be very dif­fi­cult to make.”</p>
    <p>On Mr Bi­den’s pledge to con­vene a global sum­mit of democ­ra­cies in the first year of his pres­i­dency, PM Lee said most coun­tries want to work with the US but few would be will­ing to join a coali­tion that ex­cludes play­ers like China.</p>
    <p>All coun­tries should be in­volved in work­ing out ad­just­ments to the world or­der, he said. In the process, al­liances will form and co­op­er­a­tion will take place, he added. “But to try and make a line-up, Cold War-style, I do not think that is on the cards.”</p>
    <p>On whether the US will re­join the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship trade agree­ment, PM Lee replied that this is not likely to hap­pen any time soon.</p>
    <p>“The stars are not aligned,” he said. “I still think that it makes sense for the US, but it has to make do­mes­tic po­lit­i­cal sense as well. That will take time and a dif­fer­ent align­ment of the eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion as well as the po­lit­i­cal con­fig­u­ra­tion in the US.”</p>
    <p>As for whether Mr Bi­den could reach out to Asia when he be­comes pres­i­dent, PM Lee said that it is a pos­si­bil­ity, but Asia will be just one of the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion’s many pri­or­i­ties.</p>
    <p>He also said the do­mes­tic forces rep­re­sented by Mr Trump per­sist, and will have to be dealt with.</p>
    <p>“I hope that it will be a new di­rec­tion for Amer­ica, but do not for­get that Mr Trump col­lected more votes than Barack Obama,” he said, ref­er­enc­ing the for­mer US pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>PM Lee added of Mr Trump: “He has not dis­ap­peared, nor the pres­sures which he rep­re­sented – they have not dis­ap­peared from Amer­ica’s body politic ei­ther.”</p>
    <p>At the same time, China has come to re­alise that hav­ing an Amer­ica that is “at sixes and sevens” is not much to their ad­van­tage, the Prime Min­is­ter said.</p>
    <p>“It is bet­ter to have some­body there who may not fully agree with you, but un­der­stands his in­ter­est in a broad way and whom you can deal with,” he said. “With Bi­den, maybe they will de­cide that they want a new try. I hope so. It is not easy to do this.”</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>WILMINGTON (Delaware) US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den has said the coun­try must join forces with other democ­ra­cies to present a united front in global trade pol­icy as a coun­ter­weight to China.</p>
    <p>“The idea that we’re pok­ing our fingers in the eyes of our friends and em­brac­ing au­to­crats makes no sense to me,” Mr Bi­den said in a press con­fer­ence on Mon­day to discuss his eco­nomic plan.</p>
    <p>He pledged to re­lease de­tails of his trade pol­icy agenda on Jan 21 – the day af­ter he takes of­fice.</p>
    <p>Out­go­ing Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump used an ag­gres­sive trade pol­icy against friend and foe alike, im­pos­ing tar­iffs on steel, alu­minium and other goods from Canada, Mex­ico and the Euro­pean Union, in ad­di­tion to China.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den said: “We need to be aligned with the other democ­ra­cies... so we can set the rules of the road in­stead of hav­ing China and oth­ers dic­tate out­comes be­cause they are the only game in town.”</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion es­chewed mul­ti­lat­eral or­gan­i­sa­tions, and ham­strung the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion over claims it was un­fair to the US, paralysing the dis­pute set­tle­ment body and block­ing the nam­ing of a new di­rec­tor gen­eral.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s rhetoric was gen­er­ally more friendly to­wards Rus­sia and North Korea.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den said he has spo­ken to some world lead­ers in gen­eral terms about trade is­sues, but de­clined to get into specifics with them on what he might do – in­clud­ing whether he would join a new Asia-Pa­cific free trade pact – be­cause “there is only one pres­i­dent at a time”.</p>
    <p>He said he will not pur­sue “puni­tive” trade pol­icy, but rather aim to make US work­ers more com­pet­i­tive, and en­sure labour and en­vi­ron­men­tal lead­ers “are at the ta­ble in any trade deals we make”.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the US Cham­ber of Com­merce on Mon­day said it was con­cerned that the coun­try was be­ing left be­hind af­ter 15 Asia-Pa­cific economies on Sun­day formed the world’s largest free-trade bloc, ce­ment­ing China’s dom­i­nant role in re­gional trade.</p>
    <p>The cham­ber has wel­comed the trade-lib­er­al­is­ing ben­e­fits of the new Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Part­ner­ship Agree­ment (RCEP), say­ing US ex­porters, work­ers and farm­ers needed greater ac­cess to Asian mar­kets.</p>
    <p>RCEP cov­ers 30 per cent of the global econ­omy and 30 per cent of the global pop­u­la­tion, join­ing for the first time Asian pow­ers China, Ja­pan and South Korea.</p>
    <p>The US is ab­sent from both RCEP and the suc­ces­sor to the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship, leav­ing the world’s big­gest econ­omy out of two trade groups that span the world’s fastest-grow­ing re­gion.</p>
