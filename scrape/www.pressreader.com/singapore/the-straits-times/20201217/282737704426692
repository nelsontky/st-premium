    <p>Chi­nese ac­tress Fan Bing­bing has re­vealed why she broke up with her for­mer fi­ance, ac­tor Li Chen.</p>
    <p>Fan, who was em­broiled in a tax­eva­sion scan­dal in 2018, said she ini­ti­ated the break-up 18 months ago to avoid im­pli­cat­ing him.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with the Novem­ber edi­tion of Chi­nese mag­a­zine BBArt, Fan, 39, said Li, 42, was a good per­son and that the split was un­for­tu­nate.</p>
    <p>“I have never re­gret­ted the choice of this re­la­tion­ship and I am grate­ful to him for the good times we spent to­gether,” said the ac­tress, who first made a name for her­self as Jin­suo the hand­maiden in My Fair Princess, the 1998 tele­vi­sion phe­nom­e­non.</p>
    <p>The four-year ro­mance be­tween Fan and Li was once seen as the stuff of fairy tales, with the ac­tor suc­cess­fully propos­ing to her at her birth­day party in Septem­ber 2017.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple fell in love af­ter act­ing to­gether in the TV se­rial The Em­press Of China (2014 to 2015), which Fan also co-pro­duced.</p>
    <p>Li stood by Fan through­out the scan­dal in 2018 and voiced sup­port for her on so­cial me­dia, but they even­tu­ally an­nounced their breakup in June last year.</p>
    <p>Li has been crit­i­cised by ne­ti­zens for aban­don­ing the ac­tress, but Fan de­fended him in the mag­a­zine in­ter­view, say­ing that she made the de­ci­sion to break up with him out of love.</p>
    <p>“Many peo­ple slammed him at that time be­cause they were not in our shoes and did not know how dif­fi­cult it was for us to take ev­ery step,” said Fan. “Due to my sit­u­a­tion, he and my brother were af­fected as their work was sus­pended... I felt pained for them and the only thing I could do was to dis­tance my­self from them.”</p>
    <p>Fan’s 20-year-old brother singer Fan Chengcheng. is</p>
    <p>Fan Bing­bing said Li was wor­thy of her re­spect and sac­ri­fices. “We are still good friends today and I wish him well for the fu­ture,” she added.</p>
    <p>Li is cur­rently a reg­u­lar cast mem­ber of out­door va­ri­ety pro­gramme Keep Run­ning (2017 to present).</p>
    <p>Fan’s act­ing ca­reer has been in limbo since the scan­dal, with an opin­ion piece in the over­seas edi­tion of the Peo­ple’s Daily news­pa­per nam­ing her as a black­listed artist last month.</p>
    <p>She said in the in­ter­view that she would bear re­spon­si­bil­ity for her mis­takes.</p>
    <p>“I think it does not mat­ter if you make mis­takes, be­cause ev­ery­one will make mis­takes when he or she grows up,” she said. “I recog­nised I have made a mis­take, I will cor­rect it and then face it.”</p>
