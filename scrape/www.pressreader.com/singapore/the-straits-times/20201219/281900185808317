    <p>LON­DON • Orchids are not of­ten called ugly, but that is how the Royal Botanic Gar­dens in Kew, Lon­don, de­scribed a new species of the nor­mally vi­brant and del­i­cate flower dis­cov­ered in the forests of Mada­gas­car.</p>
    <p>Gas­tro­dia ag­ni­cel­lus, one of 156 plants and fun­gal species named by Kew sci­en­tists and their part­ners around the world this year, has been crowned “the ugli­est or­chid in the world”.</p>
    <p>“The 11 mm flow­ers of this or­chid are small, brown and rather ugly,” Kew said in its list of the top 10 dis­cov­er­ies of the year. The or­chid de­pends on fungi for nu­tri­tion and has no leaves or any other pho­to­syn­thetic tis­sue.</p>
    <p>Although as­sessed as a threat­ened species, the plants have some pro­tec­tion be­cause they are lo­cated in a na­tional park.</p>
    <p>Among the other dis­cov­er­ies of­fi­cially named this year were six new species of we­b­cap toad­stool mush­rooms in the United King­dom and a strange shrub en­coun­tered in south­ern Namibia in 2010.</p>
    <p>Botanist Wes­sel Swanepoel could not place the shrub in any known genus and nei­ther could any­one else, and so Mr Swanepoel called Kew’s molec­u­lar ex­pert Fe­lix For­est and his team for anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>The re­sult was that it was not just a new species, but a new genus and a new fam­ily, called Tiganophy­ton karasense.</p>
    <p>While around 2,000 plants are named new to sci­ence an­nu­ally, new fam­i­lies are pub­lished only around once a year.</p>
    <p>The shrub has bizarre scaly leaves and grows in ex­tremely hot nat­u­ral salt pans, hence its name Tiganophy­ton, de­rived from the Latin “Tigani”, or “fry­ing pan”, and “Phy­ton”, or “plant”.</p>
    <p>Dr Martin Cheek, se­nior re­search leader at Kew, wel­comed the lat­est nat­u­ral dis­cov­er­ies.</p>
    <p>“Some could pro­vide vi­tal in­come to com­mu­ni­ties while oth­ers may have the po­ten­tial to be de­vel­oped into a fu­ture food or medicine,” he said.</p>
    <p>But he warned: “The bleak re­al­ity fac­ing us can­not be un­der­played. With two in five plants threat­ened with ex­tinc­tion, it is a race against time to find, iden­tify, name and con­serve plants be­fore they dis­ap­pear.”</p>
