    <p>The EtonHouse Group has var­i­ous pre-school op­tions cater­ing to Sin­ga­pore­ans and ex­pa­tri­ates.</p>
    <p>More than 3,000 chil­dren are en­rolled in 16 EtonHouse cam­puses and the group has a fur­ther 3,745 chil­dren across 18 E-Bridge preschools.</p>
    <p>E-Bridge was set up in 2014 and given an­chor-op­er­a­tor sta­tus in the same year.</p>
    <p>A new E-Bridge cen­tre in Can­berra will open next month, with pos­si­bly one more in the pipe­line.</p>
    <p>The fee at E-Bridge pre-schools for full-day childcare is $720 a month, ex­clud­ing GST and gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies.</p>
    <p>These are lo­cated in the heart­land, mainly in the north, north-east and west, while EtonHouse schools are in the cen­tral re­gion, east and</p>
    <p>Bukit Timah area. Fees for full-day childcare at the EtonHouse preschools range from $1,800 to $2,050.</p>
    <p>A key fea­ture of the EtonHouse pre-schools is the em­pha­sis on a strong bilin­gual foun­da­tion, with an English-lan­guage teacher and a Chi­nese-lan­guage teacher in the class­room at all times. It also has Chi­nese im­mer­sion pro­grammes at EtonHouse Zhong Hua, Robert­son Walk and Mount­bat­ten 717.</p>
    <p>WHAT THE PRE-SCHOOLS OF­FER</p>
    <p>EtonHouse pre-schools adopt an ap­proach where learn­ing is fa­cil­i­tated by teach­ers based on chil­dren’s in­ter­ests. The cen­tres fol­low its In­quire. Think. Learn cur­ricu­lum, a pro­pri­etary frame­work in­spired by the Reg­gio Emilia ap­proach, where learn­ing is done seam­lessly through in­quiry and ex­plo­ration.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng Yi Xian, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of EtonHouse In­ter­na­tional Ed­u­ca­tion Group, says it is the only school in Sin­ga­pore that col­lab­o­rates with Reg­gio Emilia in Italy.</p>
    <p>EtonHouse also runs Reach – or Reg­gio Emilia in Asia for Chil­dren – which pro­vides train­ing and pro­fes­sional learn­ing for ed­u­ca­tors in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng says: “In the real world, we do not work and think in sub­ject­based si­los.” As such, chil­dren must be able to make mean­ing­ful con­nec­tions in their learn­ing, he adds.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, rather than a stand­alone math­e­mat­ics class, a child can learn about map skills and co­or­di­nates dur­ing an out­door ex­plo­ration that builds on math­e­mat­i­cal con­cepts, lit­er­acy and prob­lem-solv­ing.</p>
    <p>An­other key as­pect of learn­ing is the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>One ex­am­ple is a dig­i­tal land­scapes ate­lier, a space where chil­dren en­gage with re­sources such as lap­tops and pro­jec­tors along with tra­di­tional con­struc­tion ma­te­ri­als, al­low­ing them to ex­plore con­cepts like light and shadow, logic and imag­i­na­tion or 2D and 3D.</p>
    <p>Weav­ing in a Reg­gio Emil­i­ain­spired prin­ci­ple known as the “100 lan­guages of chil­dren”, Mr Ng says the pre-schools have stu­dios to en­cour­age chil­dren to find creative ways beyond the spo­ken lan­guage to ex­press them­selves.</p>
    <p>This could be through sto­ry­telling, light ex­plo­ration, tin­ker­ing, or per­form­ing and vis­ual art.</p>
