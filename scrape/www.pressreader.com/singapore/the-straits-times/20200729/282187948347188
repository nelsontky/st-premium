    <p>HONG KONG • Chi­nese on­line travel gi­ant Ctrip is in talks with po­ten­tial in­vestors about fund­ing its delist­ing from Nas­daq be­cause of rising United States-China ten­sions and the coro­n­avirus-driven hit to its busi­ness, sources told Reuters.</p>
    <p>The man­age­ment of China’s largest on­line travel firm, with a cur­rent mar­ket value of US$16.5 bil­lion (S$22.8 bil­lion), has reached out to a num­ber of fi­nan­cial and strate­gic in­vestors, in­clud­ing private eq­uity firms and do­mes­tic tech com­pa­nies, about join­ing a take-private deal, said four peo­ple with di­rect knowl­edge of the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Ctrip’s move comes as US-listed Chi­nese com­pa­nies face tight­ened scru­tiny and stricter au­dit re­quire­ments from US reg­u­la­tors, while geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions es­ca­late between the world’s two largest economies. Those have prompted a num­ber of Chi­nese com­pa­nies to aban­don a New York list­ing and move in­stead to an ex­change closer to home.</p>
    <p>Ctrip’s delist­ing dis­cus­sions, which have not been re­ported pre­vi­ously, are at an early stage and are sub­ject to change, cau­tioned the sources, who spoke on con­di­tion of anonymity be­cause the mat­ter is not public.</p>
    <p>Ctrip, also known as Trip.com Group, de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>There have been six an­nounced take-private deals for US-listed Chi­nese firms worth US$9.1 bil­lion so far this year, Refini­tiv data showed. The av­er­age pre­mi­ums paid by buy­ers, how­ever, al­most halved to 22 per cent from 42 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>Deals be­ing dis­cussed in­clude a delist­ing of search en­gine gi­ant Baidu, Reuters re­ported in May.</p>
    <p>Both Ctrip and Baidu have held pre­lim­i­nary talks with Hong Kong Ex­changes and Clear­ing about a pos­si­ble sec­ondary list­ing, Reuters re­ported in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Ctrip later de­cided to delist as the coro­n­avirus out­break hit its busi­nesses badly in the first half and has weighed heav­ily on its val­u­a­tion, said one of the sources.</p>
    <p>It re­ported a 42 per cent year-onyear drop in net rev­enue in the first quar­ter of this year and a net loss of 5.4 bil­lion yuan (S$1.06 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>Its shares have fallen 17 per cent so far this year while the Nas­daq Golden Dragon China In­dex, which tracks Chi­nese firms listed on the US ex­change, has gained 22 per cent over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Founded in 1999, Ctrip went public on Nas­daq in 2003, as part of an early wave of Chi­nese tech com­pa­nies lured by high val­u­a­tions over­seas.</p>
