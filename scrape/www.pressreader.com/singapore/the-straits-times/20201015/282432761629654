    <p>Shawn Men­des</p>

    <p>Cana­dian pop sen­sa­tion Shawn Men­des (right) is back with the sin­gle Won­der, which comes with a mu­sic video lav­ishly shot in the coun­try­side. The song is from his fourth al­bum of the same name, set to be re­leased on Dec 4.</p>
    <p>In a note that ac­com­pa­nied the al­bum an­nounce­ment, Men­des de­scribes it as be­ing “like a piece of me... writ­ten down on pa­per and recorded into song”. “I tried to be as real and as hon­est as I’ve ever been,” he adds. “It’s a world, a jour­ney, a dream and an al­bum I’ve been want­ing to make for a re­ally long time. I ab­so­lutely love it.” 2</p>

    <p>Bet­ter is the first solo sin­gle by Bri­tish singer Zayn (above) in two years, re­leased a few days af­ter he and model Gigi Ha­did an­nounced the birth of their first child.</p>
    <p>The former One Di­rec­tion mem­ber, whose full name is Zayn Ma­lik, co-wrote the song. It is taken from his up­com­ing al­bum, which does not yet have a ti­tle but is said to be his most per­sonal project to date.</p>

    <p>AL­TER­NA­TIVE/ ELEC­TRONIC</p>

    <p>In an in­ter­view with The At­lantic magazine, he says the songs re­flect his pes­simistic view: “I have changed. I’ve grown old and world­weary. I’m ex­hausted. I’m disen­chanted. I’m a cur­mud­geon.</p>
    <p>“For the first time ever, on The As­cen­sion, I’m be­ing hon­est about what I feel about the world.”</p>
    <p>4</p>

    <p>A decade af­ter his solo de­but al­bum Go, Ice­landic mu­si­cian Jonsi has re­leased a fol­low-up.</p>
    <p>The front­man of post-rock stal­warts Sigur Ros worked with English pro­ducer A.G. Cook for the songs, which take on an ex­per­i­men­tal and elec­tronic bent.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been do­ing this for 30 years,” he says. “I get tired of ev­ery­thing re­ally eas­ily. I al­ways want things to be fun and ex­cit­ing and fresh, and do­ing an­other al­bum... I just wanted to have a dif­fer­ent ap­proach.”</p>
    <p>The al­bum also fea­tures col­lab­o­ra­tions with Cocteau Twins’ Liz Fraser and dance-pop singer Robyn.</p>
    <p>5</p>

    <p>The al­bum cover is de­signed by Frank Mad­docks and the songs are pro­duced by Terry Date – both also worked on the band’s iconic 2000 al­bum, White Pony.</p>
    <p>In con­junc­tion with the al­bum’s launch, the band have launched a char­ity drive to raise funds for UC Davis Chil­dren’s Hospi­tal in the United States and Crew Na­tion, an ini­tia­tive to sup­port mu­sic-in­dus­try crew whose liveli­hoods have been im­pacted by the pan­demic.</p>

    <p>Bri­tish singer Melanie C (left), also known as Sporty Spice from the Spice Girls, is back with an epony­mous al­bum, her eighth solo record.</p>
    <p>It in­cludes the sin­gle Who I Am; in the mu­sic video, she re­vis­its the dif­fer­ent phases of her life.</p>
    <p>She told Bill­board magazine: “Put­ting on that blonde wig for the North­ern Star (her 1999 de­but al­bum) era was trau­matic. I was half cry­ing, half laugh­ing, fac­ing some mo­ments in my life that had been quite hard.</p>
    <p>“But when I watched the video and re­leased it into the world, it was al­most like I’d made peace with it. It was all part of the jour­ney that I’ve been on, cre­at­ing this al­bum.”</p>
    <p>7</p>
    <p>AL­TER­NA­TIVE ROCK</p>
    <p>BY THE FIRE</p>

    <p>Moore fin­ished record­ing the al­bum – which he and mu­sic la­bel Daydream Li­brary de­scribe as com­pris­ing “nine songs of en­light­en­ment, re­leased to a world on ?re”– in March, be­fore go­ing un­der lock­down. Guest mu­si­cians in­clude Sonic Youth drum­mer Steve Shel­ley and Deb­bie Googe, bassist for shoegaze pi­o­neers My Bloody Valen­tine.</p>

    <p>Matt Berninger, the bari­tone-voiced singer of Amer­i­can al­ter­na­tive rock band The Na­tional, has re­leased his first solo al­bum.</p>
    <p>Of the ti­tle track, he says: “For a long time, I had been writ­ing songs for movies and mu­si­cals, and other projects where I needed to get in­side some­one else’s head and con­vey an­other per­son’s feel­ings.</p>
    <p>“I liked do­ing that, but I was ready to dig back into my own garbage and this was the first thing that came out.”</p>
    <p>Pro­duced by R&B-funk vet­eran Booker T. Jones from Booker T. & The M.G.’s, the al­bum in­cludes col­lab­o­ra­tions with Berninger’s band­mate Scott Deven­dorf and singer- song­writer An­drew Bird.</p>

    <p>Watch it on: bit.ly/2SSTCwc</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can singer Corey Tay­lor, who fronts metal and rock ti­tans Slip­knot and Stone Sour, has re­leased a de­but solo al­bum.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with Forbes, the pro­lific singer said it was the first time since Slip­knot’s 1999 first record that he had so much fun mak­ing an al­bum.</p>
    <p>“It’s the first time in a long time that I was sur­rounded by peo­ple who wanted to make mu­sic for the same rea­son that I did – and that was just to make in­cred­i­ble mu­sic, be­ing ex­cited about the op­por­tu­nity to make some­thing mas­sive.”</p>
    <p>The mu­sic video for the ti­tle track fea­tures cameos by rock stars, in­clud­ing Me­tal­lica’s Lars Ul­rich, Mar­i­lyn Man­son, Ju­das Priest’s Rob Hal­ford and Ja­panese band Babymetal.</p>

    <p>Raw and with min­i­mal edits, it was recorded with iconic al­ter­na­tive-rock pro­ducer Steve Al­bini – with both wear­ing masks through­out their ses­sions.</p>
    <p>“I just wanted to make a record and I wanted to make a record that was the an­tithe­sis of a Zoom call,” Grace said in an in­ter­view with Rolling Stone magazine.</p>
    <p>“I wanted to record all ana­logue. I didn’t want to make any edits. I wanted to make some­thing that mat­ters from this pe­riod of time be­cause all that s*** like live streams – I don’t mean to bash them, but they don’t cre­ate any­thing last­ing, you know?”</p>
