    <p>If the ti­tle Leave The World Be­hind evokes the quixotic tagline of an Airbnb list­ing, that is ex­actly what Amer­i­can nov­el­ist Ru­maan Alam wants you to think.</p>
    <p>In his novel, a mid­dle-class white cou­ple and their two chil­dren head to a lux­ury get­away in a re­mote Long Is­land Airbnb home.</p>
    <p>But this dream va­ca­tion goes awry when an older black cou­ple who claim to be the home own­ers ar­rive overnight, say­ing there has been a black­out in New York City and they have fled home.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions rise as the home’s offthe-grid idyll be­comes a night­mare of iso­la­tion. Net­works are down. Strange sounds rend the air. One child is be­set by an in­ex­pli­ca­ble dis­ease, the other van­ishes into the woods.</p>
    <p>Alam, 43, came up with the idea for the novel in 2017. He had no clue then that he would pro­duce a work that some­how hits so many but­tons of con­tem­po­rary anx­i­ety: the Covid-19 pandemic, the racial ten­sions fu­elling the Black Lives</p>
    <p>Mat­ter move­ment, the cli­mate cri­sis, and even the loss of travel.</p>
    <p>“It’s just a co­in­ci­dence that so many of the con­cerns of the book dove­tail with the re­al­ity in which we live,” he says in a Skype in­ter­view from his home in New York.</p>
    <p>“At the same time, the artist is an an­tenna. Things might be metas­ta­sis­ing right now in a spe­cific way, but they’ve been present for a long time. Some­times, there are sen­si­bil­i­ties dis­till­ing some­thing that we don’t nec­es­sar­ily know is in the air, un­til we see it in the art.”</p>
    <p>Alam, who was born i n the United States to Bangladesh­i im­mi­grant par­ents, has writ­ten two other nov­els, Rich And Pretty (2016), about fe­male friend­ship, and That Kind Of Mother (2018), about tran­sra­cial adop­tion.</p>
    <p>He and his hus­band have two adopted sons, aged eight and 11, who are black.</p>
    <p>Leave The World Be­hind is his buzzi­est book yet. A fi­nal­ist for this year’s Na­tional Book Awards for Fic­tion, it has been picked up for a</p>
    <p>Net­flix film adap­ta­tion star­ring Ju­lia Roberts and Den­zel Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>Alam prefers to em­ploy not the melo­drama of apoc­a­lypse, but the slow creep of dread.</p>
    <p>“There’s a cer­tain kind of pinch you feel in your fin­gers when you’re not able to get to your mo­bile phone. We’ve all heard an imag­ined alert from our phone and looked at it, and there’s been noth­ing there,” he says.</p>
    <p>“There’s some­thing much more ef­fec­tive about art that de­ploys an in­ner level of dis­com­fort that stays in­side of you, so it’s a lin­ger­ing ex­pe­ri­ence. My hope is that al­though what’s de­picted in this book should feel very re­moved from your own ex­pe­ri­ence, there are these tiny things that re­mind you how re­al­ist a work it is.”</p>
    <p>Leave The World Be­hind ($29.95) is avail­able at bit.ly/LWorldBe­hind_RA</p>
