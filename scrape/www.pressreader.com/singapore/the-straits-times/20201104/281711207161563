    <p>For ei­ther US pres­i­den­tial can­di­date, in the fight of their lives, con­ced­ing de­feat is out of the ques­tion; the only fac­tor that would trig­ger that would be a land­slide one way or the other, and while that is the­o­ret­i­cally pos­si­ble, it is un­likely.</p>
    <p>“Un­der no sce­nario will Don­ald Trump be de­clared a vic­tor on election night,” for­mer vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den’s cam­paign man­ager Jen O’Mal­ley</p>
    <p>Dil­lon said in a briefing on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>That will not pre­vent one side or the other from at­tempt­ing to seize the mo­ment should some states seem to be go­ing its way, and project vic­tory as a fait ac­com­pli. “My ex­pec­ta­tion is that the vice-pres­i­dent will ad­dress the Amer­i­can peo­ple, prob­a­bly late,” Ms O’Mal­ley Dil­lon said.</p>
    <p>What is most likely then are pro­tracted le­gal bat­tles, and po­ten­tially street bat­tles as well. The United States in 2020 is a tin­der­box of griev­ances.</p>
    <p>The Black Lives Mat­ter move­ment is ex­pected to mass peo­ple out­side the White House – pro­tected by con­cen­tric tall fences, with Na­tional Guard troops stand­ing by. Pres­i­dent Trump has said he may hold public ral­lies after yes­ter­day – in ef­fect tak­ing his mes­sage to his loyal fol­low­ers, whom he calls “my peo­ple”, and ril­ing them up.</p>
    <p>Mul­ti­ple analy­ses show Mr</p>
    <p>Bi­den has the edge over Mr Trump and will likely pre­vail. But in the in­terim, the US will be nav­i­gat­ing stormy and un­charted wa­ters.</p>
    <p>One dead­line stands out re­gard­less – the Elec­toral Col­lege is sched­uled to con­vene on Dec 14 to vote for the next pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>“Amer­i­cans will not be vot­ing for two deeply flawed can­di­dates but, rather, what each rep­re­sents and the per­ceived di­rec­tion they will take Amer­ica – a vor­tex into an ac­cel­er­ated fu­ture (un­der Mr Bi­den) or an an­chor root­ing us to a fa­mil­iar life (un­der Mr Trump),” said poll­ster John Zogby of John Zogby Strate­gies, who in a morn­ing note yes­ter­day echoed oth­ers in pro­nounc­ing the race too close to call.</p>
    <p>At stake for Mr Bi­den is the “soul of Amer­ica”. But whose Amer­ica, is the ques­tion, be­cause there are many – the Amer­ica of the older white blue-col­lar worker in the post-in­dus­trial Mid­west liv­ing in a ram­shackle house, strug­gling to make ends meet and feed his fam­ily, for in­stance; or the Amer­ica of the Asian or Latino im­mi­grant who has started a suc­cess­ful busi­ness? The Amer­ica of di­verse and cos­mopoli­tan New York City or San Fran­cisco, or the Amer­ica of deeply white con­ser­va­tive Paw Paw, West Vir­ginia; and Bed­ford County, Ten­nessee?</p>
    <p>Mr Trump is fight­ing a rear­guard ac­tion, his­to­ri­ans say, for an Amer­ica that is in­creas­ingly out of sync with de­mo­graphic and eco­nomic change, an Amer­ica that may, in fact, soon no longer ex­ist ex­cept in an ide­alised imag­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>And im­por­tant to the ide­o­log­i­cal voter at home is how the US deals with its own past – or forges ahead with­out look­ing back. The pro­test­ers who have pulled down stat­ues to his­tor­i­cal fig­ures tainted by their as­so­ci­a­tion with slav­ery, in ef­fect, have struck at what many be­lieve are the fun­da­men­tals of the na­tion, but to them rep­re­sent scars that have not been healed.</p>
    <p>An African Amer­i­can lawyer once told me that ev­ery statue to a Con­fed­er­ate gen­eral is a re­minder, to peo­ple like him, of slav­ery and the fight for civil rights.</p>
    <p>Yet, chan­nelling the no­tion of Amer­i­can ex­cep­tion­al­ism, Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo, in a con­ver­sa­tion on Sept 20 with Pas­tor Jack Gra­ham at Pre­ston­wood Bap­tist Church themed “Keep­ing the faith in the public square”, said: “We need to re­turn to the founders’ cen­tral un­der­stand­ings about faith and how this Judeo-Chris­tian na­tion is cen­tral to the world, and we must stand with it and we can’t let any­body try and re­write his­tory to sug­gest oth­er­wise.”</p>
    <p>Over­ar­ch­ing the mul­ti­tude of ar­gu­ments over Amer­ica is the fun­da­men­tal ques­tion also of democ­racy it­self. Sur­veys show that while the US still en­joys enor­mous good­will around the world, its in­ter­na­tional im­age has sunk.</p>
    <p>What is at stake are “ba­sic demo­cratic and con­sti­tu­tional norms and in­sti­tu­tions at home; and de­spite its flaws, the ba­sics of a rea­son­ably open and co­op­er­a­tive mul­ti­lat­eral in­ter­na­tional sys­tem,” pro­fes­sor of in­ter­na­tional pol­i­tics In­der­jeet Par­mar of the City, Univer­sity of Lon­don told The Straits Times. “We should be build­ing… them, not dis­man­tling and de­stroy­ing them in favour of white supremacy at home and Amer­i­can uni­lat­er­al­ism abroad.</p>
    <p>“Wrapped up in those two points is the idea of Amer­ica – its prom­ise, its as­pi­ra­tion to be open and wel­com­ing and stand for some­thing more than naked self-in­ter­est – an in­spir­ing ideal, how­ever un­re­alised in prac­tice.”</p>
