    <p>WASHINGTON Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump plans to is­sue an ex­ec­u­tive or­der al­low­ing him to im­pose US sanc­tions on any­one who vi­o­lates a con­ven­tional arms em­bargo against Iran, four sources fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter have said.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing on con­di­tion of anonymity, the sources said on</p>
    <p>Thurs­day that the ex­ec­u­tive or­der was ex­pected to be is­sued in the com­ing days and would al­low the Pres­i­dent to pun­ish vi­o­la­tors with sec­ondary sanc­tions, de­priv­ing them of ac­cess to the US mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The White House did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>The cause for the US ac­tion is the im­pend­ing ex­piry of a United Na­tions arms em­bargo on Iran and to warn for­eign ac­tors – US en­ti­ties are al­ready barred from such trade – that if they buy from or sell arms to Iran, they will face US sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>Un­der the 2015 nu­clear deal that Iran struck with six ma­jor pow­ers – Bri­tain, China, France, Ger­many, Rus­sia and the United States – the UN con­ven­tional arms em­bargo is set to ex­pire on Oct 18, shortly be­fore the Nov 3 US elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The US, which aban­doned the nu­clear deal in May 2018, said it has trig­gered a “snap­back”, or re­sump­tion, of all UN sanc­tions on Iran, in­clud­ing the arms em­bargo, which would take ef­fect at 8pm to­day (8am to­mor­row, Sin­ga­pore time).</p>
    <p>Other par­ties to the nu­clear deal and most of the UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil have said they do not be­lieve the US has the right to reim­pose the UN sanc­tions and that the US move at the UN has no le­gal ef­fect.</p>
    <p>“It is ob­vi­ous that none of the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil mem­bers have ac­cepted the el­i­gi­bil­ity of US claims,” said Mr Alireza Miry­ousefi, spokesman for Iran’s mis­sion to the UN, adding that the nu­clear deal re­mains in place and all sanc­tions on Iran will be lifted un­der the time­lines agreed in 2015.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s ex­ec­u­tive or­der is in­tended to show the US will not be de­terred de­spite fail­ing to win broader UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil back­ing of the</p>
    <p>“snap­back”, said one of the sources.</p>
    <p>An­other of the four sources, a Euro­pean diplo­mat, said the new ex­ec­u­tive or­der would put teeth be­hind Washington’s as­ser­tion that the UN arms em­bargo would re­main in place be­yond next month by giv­ing the Pres­i­dent sec­ondary sanc­tions au­thor­ity to pun­ish arms trans­fers to or from Iran with US sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>Sec­ondary sanc­tions are those where one coun­try seeks to pun­ish a sec­ond for trad­ing with a third by bar­ring ac­cess to its own mar­ket, a pow­er­ful tool for the US. Most for­eign firms do not wish to risk be­ing ex­cluded from the vast US mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The new ex­ec­u­tive or­der may be more sym­bolic than prac­ti­cal be­cause so many Ira­nian en­ti­ties and in­di­vid­u­als are al­ready sub­ject to sec­ondary sanc­tions, said sanc­tions lawyer Doug Ja­cob­son.</p>
    <p>“It’s de­signed to send a mes­sage... that the US is un­happy that the other par­ties (to the Iran nu­clear deal) did not agree to a snap­back of arms sanc­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, the US Spe­cial Rep­re­sen­ta­tive for Venezuela and Iran, Mr El­liott Abrams, said Washington planned to im­pose sanc­tions on those who vi­o­lated the UN arms em­bargo, but he did not say it would do so with an ex­ec­u­tive or­der.</p>
    <p>Diplo­mats ex­pect Iran to be a fo­cus when Mr Trump ad­dresses the an­nual UN meet­ing of world lead­ers on Tues­day from the White House.</p>
