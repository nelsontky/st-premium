    <p>Ride-hail­ing apps Uber and Lyft have long disin­gen­u­ously in­sisted that they are not trans­porta­tion com­pa­nies. This is a le­gal strat­egy that, so far, has al­lowed them to la­bel their le­gions of driv­ers as con­tract work­ers, de­priv­ing them of com­pany-backed ben­e­fits like health­care, paid leave and sev­er­ance pay.</p>
    <p>But as of Thurs­day, at least in Cal­i­for­nia, Uber and Lyft may fi­nally be able to state hon­estly they are not in the busi­ness of ar­rang­ing rides.</p>
    <p>That’s be­cause they say they have no choice but to shut­ter op­er­a­tions in one of their largest mar­kets af­ter a state judge or­dered them to com­ply with a new Cal­i­for­nia law re­quir­ing them to re­clas­sify con­tract driv­ers and grant them the ben­e­fits and pro­tec­tions af­forded to reg­u­lar em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies ar­gue that they don’t have the abil­ity to com­ply with the law by the dead­line. Uber said it would need a year or more to re­jig its op­er­a­tions to com­ply. Un­less a stay of the judge’s or­der is granted, “we would have no choice but to shut down ride-shar­ing in Cal­i­for­nia, while we work to im­ple­ment a dra­mat­i­cally dif­fer­ent ser­vice than what hun­dreds of thou­sands of driv­ers have grown ac­cus­tomed to or tell us that they want”, said Uber spokesman Noah Ed­ward­sen.</p>
    <p>While Uber is com­plain­ing that it hasn’t had enough time, the writ­ing was on the wall for</p>
    <p>Uber and Lyft in Cal­i­for­nia more than two years ago, when the state’s high­est court cre­ated a new stan­dard for clas­si­fy­ing work­ers that strongly im­pli­cated gig com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>The new law ef­fec­tively cod­i­fies that court rul­ing.</p>
    <p>Last au­tumn, Uber made changes to its app to give the ap­pear­ance of more in­de­pen­dence for driv­ers in an­tic­i­pa­tion of the state law’s tak­ing ef­fect in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Lyft and Uber spent mil­lions lob­by­ing against the law while si­mul­ta­ne­ously ar­gu­ing that it doesn’t ap­ply to them be­cause they are noth­ing more than dig­i­tal mar­ket­places for con­nect­ing driv­ers with rid­ers.</p>
    <p>In May, the state sued Uber and Lyft over their de­fi­ance of the law. This has not gone well for the com­pa­nies. “To state the ob­vi­ous, driv­ers are cen­tral, not tan­gen­tial, to Uber and Lyft’s en­tire ride-hail­ing busi­ness,” wrote Judge Ethan Schul­man of Cal­i­for­nia Su­pe­rior Court, who last week gave the com­pa­nies un­til Thurs­day to com­ply.</p>
    <p>If the com­pa­nies’ ar­gu­ment that they are just dig­i­tal “match­mak­ers” were to stick, Judge Schul­man wrote, “the rapidly ex­pand­ing ma­jor­ity of in­dus­tries that rely heav­ily on tech­nol­ogy could with im­punity de­prive le­gions of work­ers of the ba­sic pro­tec­tions af­forded to em­ploy­ees by state labour and em­ploy­ment laws”.</p>
    <p>This is not the first time Uber and Lyft have threat­ened to pull out of a mar­ket over leg­is­la­tion they op­pose. Mary­land leg­is­la­tors backed off from a pro­posal to bol­ster back­ground checks for gig work­ers with fin­ger­print­ing af­ter Uber warned it would leave the state. And af­ter a mul­ti­mil­lion-dol­lar cam­paign led by Uber and Lyft against fin­ger­print back­ground checks for driv­ers failed to sway vot­ers in Austin, Texas, the com­pa­nies left for a year un­til a state law was passed in their favour.</p>
    <p>This time, how­ever, Uber and Lyft are fight­ing with di­min­ished lever­age as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and shel­ter-in-place or­ders have made ride-share vol­ume nose­dive.</p>
    <p>At one point in the fight against the Cal­i­for­nia law, Uber’s chief at­tor­ney un­leashed a corker, ar­gu­ing that “driv­ers’ work is out­side the usual course of Uber’s busi­ness”.</p>
    <p>Cen­tral to the ride-hail­ing com­pa­nies’ ar­gu­ment against the state law is that driv­ers would lose the flex­i­bil­ity they cher­ish – the abil­ity to log into the app when they choose to see if there is a de­sir­able fare. But labour ex­perts say Uber and Lyft could clas­sify driv­ers as em­ploy­ees while still pro­vid­ing them with flex­i­ble work sched­ules.</p>
    <p>“There are count­less com­pa­nies that of­fer part-time work and a range of ben­e­fits based on how much you work,” said Stan­ford Uni­ver­sity law pro­fes­sor and for­mer National Labour Re­la­tions Board chair­man Wil­liam B. Gould IV. “What these com­pa­nies have cre­ated isn’t in­no­va­tion, it’s ex­ploita­tion.”</p>
    <p>Uber and Lyft note that in sur­veys, the ma­jor­ity of driv­ers say they pre­fer the con­trac­tor model. But this elides the fact that most driv­ers log just a few hours per week or per month, while a smaller group of full-time driv­ers ac­count for the vast ma­jor­ity of rides and hours logged on the app. Those full-time work­ers are ef­fec­tively em­ploy­ees with­out any of the ben­e­fits of be­ing em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>The more com­pelling ar­gu­ment against the Cal­i­for­nia law may be that the higher costs of pay­ing for guar­an­teed wages and ben­e­fits will have to be passed along to pas­sen­gers. But the truth is that these com­pa­nies have trained cus­tomers to ex­pect ar­ti­fi­cially low fares, and it’s time rid­ers dug deeper into their wal­lets to re­flect the real cost of tak­ing an Uber or a Lyft.</p>
    <p>This could be ben­e­fi­cial for the com­pa­nies as well: By sub­si­dis­ing the rides, Uber and Lyft have racked up bil­lions in losses. They ap­pear to be bid­ing their time un­til ubiq­ui­tous self-driv­ing cars mean they can elim­i­nate driv­ers once and for all.</p>
    <p>And even un­der the con­tract worker model, there is lit­tle ev­i­dence that Uber and Lyft have a sus­tain­able busi­ness model. To­gether, they lost a stag­ger­ing US$11.1 bil­lion (S$15.2 bil­lion) last year and an­other US$3.3 bil­lion in this year’s first quar­ter be­fore the full force of the pan­demic took hold. It’s likely they would have to raise fares soon any­way.</p>
    <p>In a New York Times op-ed es­say this month, Uber chief ex­ec­u­tive Dara Khos­row­shahi ar­gued that “gig work­ers de­serve bet­ter”. In­deed. But time and again, Uber’s driv­ers have borne the brunt of the com­pany’s whims.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, Uber doesn’t pay into state un­em­ploy­ment funds for driv­ers, mean­ing the work­ers were re­liant on fed­eral as­sis­tance when the pan­demic struck. And driv­ers have com­plained that the com­pa­nies can cut off ac­cess to the app sud­denly and with­out re­course, change fare struc­tures and dic­tate pre­cisely what routes to take. When driv­ers con­sid­ered form­ing a union in Seat­tle, Uber bom­barded them with anti-union mes­sag­ing in the app.</p>
    <p>Now the two com­pa­nies are weigh­ing adopt­ing a fran­chise model in Cal­i­for­nia that would make them re­liant on fleet op­er­a­tors to han­dle rides. Do­ing so would likely cut off thou­sands of driv­ers, The New York Times re­ported.</p>
    <p>Mr Khos­row­shahi says a third model of em­ploy­ment is nec­es­sary, in which the com­pa­nies could pay into a fund that driv­ers can use for health­care or sick leave while re­main­ing con­trac­tors. The no­tion, floated since Cal­i­for­nia’s law went into ef­fect, will be con­sid­ered by vot­ers in a bal­lot mea­sure in Novem­ber. The mea­sure ap­pears to be a roll­back of pro­tec­tions and ben­e­fits that driv­ers should be get­ting un­der the state law.</p>
    <p>The ride-hail­ing com­pa­nies have been flout­ing that law since Jan­uary, hop­ing for a bailout from the courts or from vot­ers this au­tumn.</p>
    <p>“Say­ing this doesn’t ap­ply to them has no ba­sis in law, and that’s been backed up by the court,” said law pro­fes­sor Cather­ine Fisk at the Uni­ver­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, Berkeley. “If they can­not pro­vide a busi­ness that com­plies with the law, they need to get out of that busi­ness.”</p>
