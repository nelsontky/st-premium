    <p>WAKE UP AND SCOLD ME, MUMMY: Lo­cal ac­tor</p>
    <p>Ben­jamin Tan posted on In­sta­gram on Sun­day im­plor­ing his mother, who is cur­rently in a coma, to wake up. The 27-year-old, who starred in the re­cent Me­di­a­corp drama My Guardian An­gels, posted a pic­ture (above) of him with his par­ents cel­e­brat­ing her birth­day in 2018 and com­mented in Chi­nese: “Mummy, don’t you hate it when I post pic­tures of you with your ‘triple chin’? I’ve just posted this, why don’t you wake up and scold me?”</p>
    <p>He added: “Can you re­ally bear to leave us be­hind? But if you’re tired... let us know. I will work hard, I will make you proud of me.”</p>
    <p>He said in the post that doc­tors had told him his mother “might leave at any time”, but that he was not ready to face this and missed hav­ing her around.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor told The Straits Times through his man­ager that his 51-year-old mother was un­con­scious and needed life sup­port when she was hos­pi­talised on July 4. She was di­ag­nosed with a blood clot press­ing on her brain stem. Though she showed signs of im­prove­ment at one point, her con­di­tion took a turn for the worse and she slipped back into a coma.</p>
    <p>Tan, who is an only child, re­cently bought a silky poo­dle named Toki, which he re­ferred to as his mother’s fur grand­son in his post.</p>
    <p>His post on July 8 hinted at trou­bles at home. He had said: “A lot of things in life hap­pen for a rea­son, and some­times en­tirely out of our con­trol. The past week has been a crazy week for me as some fam­ily emer­gency hap­pened. Yet, no mat­ter how wor­ried I am, I got to head to work as film­ing re­sumes and put on a smile.” He is work­ing on a Chan­nel 8 se­ries which also stars Rui En and Elvin Ng.</p>
