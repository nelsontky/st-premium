    <p>A cy­clist has been given a pri­son sen­tence over an ac­ci­dent in­volv­ing a pedes­trian, who died of his in­juries five days after the crash.</p>
    <p>Toni Timo Salmi­nen, who is Fin­nish, was yes­ter­day sen­tenced to a week’s jail after plead­ing guilty to caus­ing Mr Chew Fook Yew’s death by cy­cling in a neg­li­gent man­ner.</p>
    <p>Salmi­nen, 42, had failed to keep a proper look­out while cy­cling in Sims Av­enue on Oct 1 last year.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Rimplejit Kaur said the 53-year-old pedes­trian had not been jay­walk­ing, and the ac­ci­dent hap­pened more than 50m from the near­est pedes­trian cross­ing.</p>
    <p>She said: “This is not a case where t he de­ceased sud­denly dashed onto the road, sud­denly ap­peared (on) the road from an ob­scured po­si­tion, sud­denly stopped while cross­ing the road, sud­denly turned back while cross­ing the road, hes­i­tated or lin­gered while cross­ing the road or sud­denly bent down to pick up some­thing while cross­ing the road.</p>
    <p>“In fact... the ac­cused had an un­ob­structed view of the en­tire process of the de­ceased cross­ing the road, from the com­mence­ment to col­li­sion, if he had a kept a proper look­out.”</p>
    <p>Salmi­nen was in the sec­ond lane of the four-lane road in Sims Av­enue, go­ing to­wards Sims Av­enue East, at about 6.15pm when Mr Chew stepped onto the fourth and ex­treme left lane of the road.</p>
    <p>Al­though Salmi­nen spot­ted Mr Chew walk­ing briskly across the third lane, he did not slow down.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tor said: “Ac­cord­ing to the ac­cused, when the de­ceased was al­ready in lane two, the ac­cused rang the bi­cy­cle bell and jammed his brakes...The ac­cused, how­ever, could not stop the bi­cy­cle in time as the dis­tance be­tween the ac­cused and the de­ceased was too short.</p>
    <p>“As a re­sult, the ac­cused col­lided (with) the de­ceased. The de­ceased fell back­wards onto the road while the ac­cused was flung off the bi­cy­cle and onto the road.”</p>
    <p>Salmi­nen then at­tended to Mr Chew, who was ly­ing mo­tion­less on the road, and waited un­til an am­bu­lance ar­rived at the scene.</p>
    <p>An am­bu­lance took the pedes­trian to Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal, and Salmi­nen alerted the po­lice about the in­ci­dent at about 7.10pm that day.</p>
    <p>Mr Chew was pro­nounced dead at around 10.30pm on Oct 6 last year.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing an au­topsy, he was found to have died from a head in­jury, con­sis­tent with one sus­tained in a traf­fic ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>For caus­ing Mr Chew’s death by cy­cling in a neg­li­gent man­ner, Salmi­nen could have been jailed for up to two years and fined.</p>
    <p>The ac­cused had an un­ob­structed view of the en­tire process of the de­ceased cross­ing the road, from the com­mence­ment to col­li­sion, if he had a kept a proper look­out.</p>
