    <p>Busi­ness lead­ers in­ter­viewed by The Straits Times said that some sec­tors do have a skills short­age that can be filled by for­eign­ers. But they all agree that there is no rea­son for com­pa­nies to hire work­ers only from a sin­gle for­eign na­tion­al­ity.</p>
    <p>A se­nior labour MP has called on the au­thor­i­ties to dis­close the names of com­pa­nies put on a watch list for bi­ased hir­ing, to im­prove trans­parency and send a strong sig­nal that such be­hav­iour must stop.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Trades Union Congress as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Pa­trick Tay told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that “it is ever more crit­i­cal for us to en­sure that Sin­ga­pore­ans are con­sid­ered fairly, es­pe­cially in the cur­rent em­ploy­ment cli­mate”.</p>
    <p>He has been lob­by­ing to tighten the Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work (FCF) to en­sure work­places are fair and pro­gres­sive, and to strongly de­ter un­fair hir­ing prac­tices.</p>
    <p>The FCF was in­tro­duced in 2014 to main­tain a strong Sin­ga­porean core in PMET (pro­fes­sional, man­age­rial, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian) jobs and re­quires em­ploy­ers to as­sess Sin­ga­pore­ans fairly for all job open­ings.</p>
    <p>Amid con­cerns from job seek­ers in a tough job mar­ket caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) said on Wed­nes­day that 47 more em­ploy­ers were re­cently added to the FCF watch list for po­ten­tially dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices, on top of an ear­lier 1,200.</p>
    <p>Eigh­teen of these firms have for­eign­ers com­pris­ing over half of their PMET work­force. Thirty are in the fi­nan­cial and pro­fes­sional ser­vices, and were found to have a high con­cen­tra­tion of PMETs from sin­gle na­tion­al­i­ties – sig­nif­i­cantly higher than their in­dus­try peers.</p>
    <p>Their Em­ploy­ment Pass (EP) ap­pli­ca­tions for for­eign hires will be closely scru­ti­nised, and those who are re­cal­ci­trant or un­co­op­er­a­tive will have their work pass priv­i­leges cut back.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay said dis­clos­ing the com­pa­nies’ names will al­low job seek­ers to be bet­ter in­formed.</p>
    <p>Asked why MOM did not name com­pa­nies on the watch list, which was first in­tro­duced in 2016, a min­istry spokesman told ST that it will pe­ri­od­i­cally pub­li­cise the names of firms that are found guilty of dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, in March 2020, MOM re­leased the names of five em­ploy­ers pe­nalised for age-re­lated dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing,” it said.</p>
    <p>They are: ed­u­ca­tion cen­tre Wis­domtree Learn­ing Cen­tre, events com­pany Out­shin­erz Events, and se­cu­rity firm Se­cu­rity & Risk So­lu­tions, all of which had in­di­cated pre­ferred age cri­te­ria in job ads. Two re­lated com­pa­nies, In­cred­i­ble Ser­vice Doc and IDOC, granted in­ter­views only to fe­male Chi­nese ap­pli­cants un­der the age of 45.</p>
    <p>For breach­ing Tri­par­tite Guide­lines on Fair Em­ploy­ment Prac­tices, MOM barred the five firms from hir­ing for­eign­ers and from re­new­ing the work passes of ex­ist­ing for­eign em­ploy­ees for 12 months.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay pro­posed two other mea­sures to tackle bi­ased hir­ing: Re­move the ex­emp­tion for in­tra-cor­po­rate trans­fer­ees (ICTs), and have tougher mea­sures and pe­nal sanc­tions against com­pa­nies that treat the FCF as “mere win­dow dress­ing” or find ways to cir­cum­vent the re­quire­ments through the use of ex­emp­tions.</p>
    <p>He said: “This will help level the play­ing field for Sin­ga­porean job seek­ers, such that as long as they are com­pe­tent and qual­i­fied for the job, they can ap­ply and be con­sid­ered for the po­si­tion.”</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, a job is ex­empted from the FCF ad­ver­tis­ing re­quire­ment if it will be filled by an ICT.</p>
    <p>The re­quire­ment states that em­ploy­ers must ad­ver­tise po­si­tions for Sin­ga­pore­ans on Jobs Bank – launched in 2014 to fa­cil­i­tate job match­ing for lo­cal job seek­ers – be­fore they can ap­ply for an EP.</p>
    <p>To be ex­empted, the EP can­di­date has to meet the strin­gent def­i­ni­tion of ICTs un­der the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s Gen­eral Agree­ment on Trade in Ser­vices, or any ap­pli­ca­ble free trade pact that Sin­ga­pore is party to. This in­cludes term lim­its and a min­i­mum num­ber of years of work ex­pe­ri­ence in the com­pany out­side Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, MOM said the FCF watch list was in­tro­duced to proac­tively iden­tify em­ploy­ers sus­pected of dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices.</p>
    <p>Through the Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Fair and Pro­gres­sive Em­ploy­ment Prac­tices’ en­gage­ment, firms sus­pected of dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices will be re­ferred to MOM for in­ves­ti­ga­tion and ac­tion, it said.</p>
    <p>MOM added that those on the watch list have to take im­me­di­ate ac­tions to cor­rect their prac­tices, and will be as­sessed ev­ery six months.</p>
    <p>“If they im­prove on their hir­ing prac­tices, they will exit the watch list. Only a hand­ful of firms have been put back on the watch list af­ter ex­it­ing it.”</p>
    <p>Calls for tougher mea­sures have been raised in Par­lia­ment. Last Novem­ber, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Man­power Zaqy Mo­hamad said the FCF watch list has shifted em­ployer be­hav­iour, but has not gone un­no­ticed: “If lead­ing global com­pa­nies think twice about in­vest­ing in Sin­ga­pore or re­think their fu­ture plans for Sin­ga­pore, the re­sult could be fewer good jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans. So, it is a del­i­cate bal­anc­ing act.”</p>
