    <p>In a de­tailed 100-page judg­ment on Fri­day, a High Court judge ac­quit­ted a for­mer do­mes­tic worker of steal­ing from the af­flu­ent fam­ily that she worked for. Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn laid out the rea­sons why a po­lice re­port may have been made against her, and why he be­lieved her tes­ti­mony.</p>
    <p>For the nine years from 2007 that she worked for Changi Air­port Group chair­man Liew Mun Leong and his fam­ily, In­done­sian Parti Liyani had a rel­a­tively har­mo­nious re­la­tion­ship with its mem­bers.</p>
    <p>They gave her gen­er­ous red pack­ets and raised her monthly salary from $300 to $600.</p>
    <p>How­ever, from time to time, she clashed with her em­ployer’s son, Karl, over her house­hold chores at the Chancery Lane fam­ily home.</p>
    <p>Things got more heated when Mr Karl Liew moved out with his fam­ily in March 2016 to a house nearby.</p>
    <p>The do­mes­tic worker was told to go there to help with the chores, as well as clean his of­fice in another lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>It is dis­puted how of­ten Ms Parti was asked to do the ex­tra work.</p>
    <p>Mr Liew Mun Leong’s wife, Madam Ng Lai Peng, said she paid the maid $20 on each of the three oc­ca­sions she asked her to work at her son’s house.</p>
    <p>But Ms Parti, 46, said she cleaned Mr Karl Liew’s of­fice once a week for about a year. She said she re­ceived $10 for two to three days of work, and the pay­ment was not reg­u­lar.</p>
    <p>Dis­putes arose over her re­fusal to clean a toi­let at his home and to cook ex­tra food for him.</p>
    <p>On Oct 28, 2016, when Mr Karl Liew told Ms Parti she was fired, she replied: “I know why. You an­gry (sic) be­cause I re­fused to clean up your toi­let.”</p>
    <p>Given two hours to pack be­fore she went home to In­done­sia, she be­came an­gry and threat­ened to lodge a com­plaint with the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) about the il­le­gal work de­ploy­ments.</p>
    <p>Two days later, while she was back in In­done­sia, Mr Liew and his son made a po­lice re­port af­ter the fam­ily al­legedly found their be­long­ings in three boxes, which Mr Karl Liew had agreed to pay to ship to her.</p>
    <p>In his judg­ment, Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn noted that “some time prior to her ter­mi­na­tion”, Ms Parti had ex­pressed un­hap­pi­ness at be­ing made to do ad­di­tional work.</p>
    <p>“There is rea­son to be­lieve that the Liew fam­ily, upon re­al­is­ing her un­hap­pi­ness, took the pre-emp­tive first step to ter­mi­nate her em­ploy­ment sud­denly with­out giv­ing her suf­fi­cient time for her to pack, in the hope that Parti would not use the time to make a com­plaint to MOM.”</p>
    <p>Once she made clear – upon be­ing fired – her de­sire to com­plain to MOM, the Liew fam­ily “fol­lowed up with the po­lice re­port to en­sure her re­turn would be pre­vented”, said the judge. “In my view, the Liew fam­ily might not have made a po­lice re­port had Parti not made her ex­press threat on Oct 28, 2016 to re­port the mat­ter to MOM.”</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan did not be­lieve the tes­ti­mony of the el­der Mr Liew, who said he had de­cided to fire her be­cause things had gone miss­ing “over the years”.</p>
    <p>The judge said there was no ev­i­dence that any new items were dis­cov­ered to be miss­ing that ne­ces­si­tated the maid’s im­me­di­ate and sud­den ter­mi­na­tion while Mr Liew was over­seas.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan ex­am­ined in de­tail the ex­pla­na­tions given by Ms Parti and the fam­ily mem­bers over the var­i­ous items al­leged to be stolen. The judge noted many showed “some form of dys­func­tion­al­ity”.</p>
    <p>He be­lieved Ms Parti, who said many of the items had been dis­carded by the Liew fam­ily, some of them dur­ing Mr Karl Liew’s move.</p>
    <p>He said it was “not unimag­in­able” that things would be thrown away in the process.</p>
    <p>“Parti’s ex­pla­na­tion is nei­ther un­be­liev­able nor un­com­mon, es­pe­cially when one con­sid­ers this in the light of the af­flu­ence of the Liew house­hold, Karl’s will­ing­ness to give away the black bag con­tain­ing suits, jack­ets and pants, the neat­ness and tidi­ness of the in­te­rior of the house... in­di­cat­ing that the Liew fam­ily were not hoard­ers.”</p>
    <p>The fam­ily had also recorded a video of the items taken out of the boxes af­ter Ms Parti left.</p>
    <p>In the video, Madam Ng said she wanted to get a karung guni man to help her “move” them. Her son replied: “You can­not get the karung guni man here. It’s still her things, mum.”</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan said this in­di­cated that the Liew fam­ily in­tended to throw the items away. “I do not get any im­pres­sion that the Liew fam­ily would have the habit of keep­ing old, un­wanted or spoilt items in the house and not dis­card them.”</p>
    <p>Ms Parti has one more charge pend­ing, which is the pos­ses­sion of items, in­clud­ing wal­lets and ez-link cards, which are sus­pected to have been fraud­u­lently ob­tained.</p>
