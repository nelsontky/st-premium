    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s first Covid-19 spe­cific T cell clin­i­cal trial is ready to re­cruit its first pa­tients. Con­ducted by a re­search team from KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hospi­tal, this hu­man trial of a po­ten­tial coro­n­avirus treat­ment re­ceived ap­proval from the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity in July.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s first ever Covid-19 spe­cific T cell clin­i­cal trial is ready to re­cruit its first pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Con­ducted by a re­search team from KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hospi­tal (KKH), this hu­man trial of a po­ten­tial coro­n­avirus treat­ment re­ceived ap­proval from the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity in July.</p>
    <p>The trial is tar­get­ing pa­tients with se­vere Covid-19 disease as well as those at risk of de­vel­op­ing se­vere disease. There are five hospi­tals where pa­tients can re­ceive this T cell treat­ment.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients who de­velop se­vere Covid-19 disease were found to have low lev­els of T cells, which are a type of white blood cell that helps the body fight in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Only pa­tients who have re­cov­ered from the coro­n­avirus have Covid-19 spe­cific T cells.</p>
    <p>Called Covid-19 mem­ory T cells, they are ready to mul­ti­ply in re­sponse to re­in­fec­tions by SarsCoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19. The im­mune re­sponse dur­ing re­in­fec­tion will be quicker and more po­tent.</p>
    <p>For this study, Covid-19 spe­cific T cells were har­vested from blood do­nated by six re­cov­ered Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Around 350ml to 450ml of blood was col­lected from the first batch of donors in April.</p>
    <p>The T cells har­vested from this blood, suf­fi­cient to treat 40 pa­tients, are cur­rently stored in a cell bank.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients with se­vere Covid-19 will be treated with the T cells in­tra­venously. In­fected pa­tients at risk of de­vel­op­ing se­vere disease – such as those above the age of 65, or obese in­di­vid­u­als – will be treated pre-emp­tively.</p>
    <p>The two main ob­jec­tives of the trial are to prove that the T cells are safe to use, and that this treat­ment method is ef­fec­tive. For in­stance, to mea­sure the ef­fi­cacy of this trial, the clin­i­cal re­sponse in terms of time taken to re­cover from a Covid-19 in­fec­tion would be mea­sured.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients will also be mon­i­tored for six months to a year to look out for side ef­fects and to en­sure that the trial is safe.</p>
    <p>Achiev­ing im­mu­nity to the SarsCov-2 virus has been some­thing which sci­en­tists around the globe are rac­ing to­wards.</p>
    <p>Im­mu­nity comes in two forms, Pro­fes­sor Le­ung Wing Hang, a se­nior con­sul­tant in the haema­tol­ogy on­col­ogy ser­vice at KKH said. Ac­tive im­mu­nity could be achieved via nat­u­ral in­fec­tion or through vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, pas­sive im­mu­nity – where the im­mu­nity of a re­cov­ered pa­tient is trans­ferred to a cur­rently ill pa­tient – can be done via B cells and T cells, both of which are white blood cells.</p>
    <p>When the Sars-CoV-2 virus en­ters the body, phago­cytes – another type of white blood cell – are ac­ti­vated to in­gest the virus.</p>
    <p>“Now the prob­lem with SarsCoV-2 is that it lives in­side the in­fected cells, mak­ing it dif­fi­cult for the phago­cytes to in­gest the virus, as the phago­cytes are out­side the in­fected cell. In the ab­sence of a T cell re­sponse, the phago­cytes will pro­lif­er­ate as they try to get rid of the virus,” Prof Le­ung, who is also the lead of this study, ex­plained.</p>
    <p>“This ends up caus­ing more harm than good: Too many phago­cytes lead to tis­sue hy­per-in­flam­ma­tion, which we see in Covid-19 pa­tients.”</p>
    <p>Con­versely, the pres­ence of T cells will not only help B cells make an­ti­bod­ies, but they can also di­rectly kill virus-in­fected cells, damp­en­ing the in­flam­ma­tion caused by the phago­cytes.</p>
    <p>In the treat­ment be­ing tri­alled, the donor and re­cip­i­ent will have to be first matched via tis­sue typ­ing be­fore the Covid-19 spe­cific T cells are in­jected.</p>
    <p>Dr Michaela Seng, a con­sul­tant in the haema­tol­ogy on­col­ogy ser­vice at KKH and the co-au­thor of this study, said: “We have found that re­gard­less of race and eth­nic­ity, pa­tients here will have more than a 90 per cent chance of match­ing with at least one of the 40 units of these Covid-19 spe­cific T cells in the bank.”</p>
    <p>The re­searchers ex­pect that a sin­gle dose will suf­fice in help­ing a pa­tient re­cover.</p>
    <p>Given that the man­u­fac­ture of the T cells takes just a day, sup­ply of these cells can be scaled up quickly if re­quired.</p>
    <p>Frag­ments of pro­teins from the Covid-19 virus are mixed with the cells from the donor. Only those T cells spe­cific to Covid-19 will bind to the frag­ment pro­teins, al­low­ing them to be har­vested.</p>
    <p>Plans to in­ter­na­tion­alise the trial are also un­der way, Prof Le­ung said. KKH’s col­lab­o­ra­tors in Europe are in the midst of ob­tain­ing reg­u­la­tory ap­proval.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully, tri­als in Europe can open at a sim­i­lar time, al­low­ing this to be­come a multi­na­tional study that is headed by Sin­ga­pore, in KKH,” Prof Le­ung said.</p>
    <p>Lo­cally, the Repub­lic has five hospi­tals where pa­tients can re­ceive this T cell treat­ment. Pa­tients must give con­sent be­fore they re­ceive the treat­ment.</p>
    <p>These are KKH, which is the lead site, Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hospi­tal, Sengkang Gen­eral Hospi­tal, Changi Gen­eral Hospi­tal and Na­tional Univer­sity Hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>KKH said the trial is the first in the world, as other in­ter­na­tional groups are re­search­ing T cells that are non­spe­cific to the Covid-19 virus.</p>
