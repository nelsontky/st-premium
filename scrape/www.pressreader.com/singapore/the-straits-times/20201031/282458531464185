    <p>Not los­ing hope and stay­ing flex­i­ble – th­ese are two of the key qual­i­ties prin­ci­pal ca­reer coach Chris­tine Gan con­sid­ers vi­tal for deal­ing with job­less­ness.</p>
    <p>Ms Gan, of govern­ment agency Work­force Sin­ga­pore (WSG), also said it is nat­u­ral for a re­trenched worker to ex­pe­ri­ence neg­a­tive emo­tions, such as feel­ing a lack of self-worth and a sense of un­cer­tainty. But it is im­por­tant to stay pos­i­tive as there are still job op­por­tu­ni­ties, she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Gan gave th­ese tips yes­ter­day, when she and The Straits Times as­sis­tant news ed­i­tor Toh Yong Chuan dis­cussed ways work­ers can cope with job­less­ness as a re­sult of the fall­out from the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The talk is part of this month’s askST@NLB ses­sion, which was filmed and streamed on ST’s Face­book page. The talks are a col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween ST and the Na­tional Li­brary Board (NLB).</p>
    <p>Some of the main chal­lenges faced by job seek­ers Ms Gan has coached are hav­ing poor skills in search­ing and ap­ply­ing for jobs.</p>
    <p>Job-search­ing re­quires a high de­gree of self-re­flec­tion and know­ing how to align one’s re­sume with hir­ing cri­te­ria, Ms Gan said.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes tak­ing stock of one’s ex­per­tise be­fore match­ing it with a rel­e­vant role. It is im­por­tant for job seek­ers to customise their re­sumes to each job they ap­ply for in­stead of adopt­ing a “one size fits all” ap­proach, she added, not­ing that many job ap­pli­cants also lack aware­ness of their short­com­ings.</p>
    <p>Ms Gan sug­gested that those who are un­able to show con­fi­dence dur</p>
    <p>A talk by</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant News Ed­i­tor, The Straits Times, and ing in­ter­views can con­sider at­tend­ing ca­reer work­shops, like those con­ducted by WSG.</p>
    <p>Those who are job­less can also turn to re­sources on job-seek­ing and reskilling which are avail­able from ProQuest Cen­tral, a data­base sub­scribed to by NLB.</p>
    <p>Look for th­ese at str.sg/proquest us­ing the key­words “cop­ing with un­em­ploy­ment”, “reskilling and up­skilling” and “job hunt­ing”.</p>
    <p>A myLi­braryID is needed to ac­cess this data­base.</p>
    <p>If you do not have a myLi­braryID, you can go to ac­count.nlb.gov.sg and sign up for one us­ing your SingPass or NRIC/FIN.</p>

    <p>Tips For Job-hunt­ing In A Pan­demic: With More Ap­pli­cants And Fewer Op­por­tu­ni­ties Than Ever, Job-hunt­ing Looks Very Dif­fer­ent Due To Covid-19</p>
    <p>(The Globe and Mail, 2020) • How To Find A Job Or Use Fur­lough Time Strate­gi­cally In The Coro­n­avirus Econ­omy</p>
    <p>(The Tele­graph, 2020)</p>
    <p>• Those who missed the video can find it on str.sg/askstnlb. Past AskST@NLB ses­sions can be found there as well.</p>
    <p>Novem­ber events</p>
    <p>There will be two askST@NLB ses­sions next month.</p>
    <p>The first ses­sion is on Nov 13, with se­nior ed­u­ca­tion correspond­ent San­dra Davie and Ms Les­lie Davis, a train­ing con­sul­tant at Bri­tish Coun­cil Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>They will dis­cuss why youth have to re­learn how to read and what par­ents can do to de­velop crit­i­cal read­ing skills in their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Send your ques­tions to str.sg/askstNOV13 by 7pm on Wed­nes­day.</p>
