    <p>AT­LANTA • Mr Jon Os­soff com­pleted a Demo­cratic sweep of Ge­or­gia’s Se­nate run-offs, a strik­ing po­lit­i­cal val­i­da­tion for his party in a state that has been chal­leng­ing for the US Democrats for most of the past two decades.</p>
    <p>The out­come prompted some Repub­li­cans to blame Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump for dis­suad­ing the party’s vot­ers from turn­ing out in force with his false as­ser­tions that Ge­or­gia’s elec­tions were rigged.</p>
    <p>Mr Os­soff, the 33-year-old head of a video pro­duc­tion com­pany, de­feated Mr David Per­due, a Repub­li­can who had just com­pleted his first full term in of­fice. Less than 12 hours ear­lier, Rev­erend Raphael Warnock, the se­nior pas­tor of Ebenezer Bap­tist Church in At­lanta, un­seated Repub­li­can Sen­a­tor Kelly Lo­ef­fler, be­com­ing the first black Democrat elected to the Se­nate from the South.</p>
    <p>The re­sults of the Ge­or­gia Se­nate races will re­shape the bal­ance of power in gov­ern­ment. Al­though the Democrats will have the thinnest of ad­van­tages in the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives and the Se­nate, where Vice-Pres­i­den­t­elect Ka­mala Harris will break the 50-50 tie, they will con­trol the com­mit­tees as well as the leg­is­la­tion and nom­i­na­tions brought to the floor. Such ad­van­tage will pave the way for at least some el­e­ments of Mr Bi­den’s agenda.</p>
    <p>“For the first time in six years,</p>
    <p>Democrats will op­er­ate a ma­jor­ity in the United States Se­nate – and that will be very good for the Amer­i­can peo­ple,” Sen­a­tor Chuck Schumer of New York, who will be­come the new ma­jor­ity leader, said at a cel­e­bra­tory news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>A top state elec­tion of­fi­cial, Mr Gabriel Ster­ling, blamed Mr Trump for the Repub­li­cans’ de­feat, ac­cus­ing the Pres­i­dent of spark­ing “a civil war within a GOP that needed to be united to get through a tough fight like this”.</p>
    <p>He said the Pres­i­dent had spent more time at­tack­ing Repub­li­can of­fi­cials in Ge­or­gia than he did Mr Warnock and Mr Os­soff.</p>
