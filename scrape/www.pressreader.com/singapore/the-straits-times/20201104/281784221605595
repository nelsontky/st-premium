    <p>IM­POR­TANT FOR BUSI­NESSES</p>
    <p>A new weapon has been added to Sin­ga­pore’s arse­nal against Covid-19: an au­to­mated sys­tem that mon­i­tors oxy­gen lev­els in the blood.</p>
    <p>Low blood oxy­gen lev­els could be a symp­tom of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The new sys­tem utilises Blue­tooth-en­abled pulse oxime­ters to mea­sure blood oxy­gen lev­els.</p>
    <p>It will help au­to­mate man­ual tasks and com­pile pulse oxime­ter read­ings from thou­sands of in­di­vid­u­als neatly on a dash­board.</p>
    <p>A team of re­searchers from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) – in con­sul­ta­tion with clin­i­cians from the Na­tional Univer­sity</p>
    <p>Hos­pi­tal and Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal – worked on the new sys­tem from April to June. The project was also sup­ported by both Te­masek Foun­da­tion and the Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>This new sys­tem con­sists of sev­eral com­po­nents: wire­less nodes to cap­ture data from the Blue­tooth-en­abled pulse oxime­ters, in­di­vid­ual Blue­tooth-en­abled pulse oxime­ters which peo­ple can use to take their read­ings, Wi-Fi sta­tions and a dash­board that presents the data.</p>
    <p>Work­ers re­sid­ing in dor­mi­to­ries need to mea­sure and record their oxime­ter read­ings twice a day as part of pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures to iden­tify new cases of in­fec­tion. This is now done man­u­ally.</p>
    <p>With the NUS wire­less sys­tem, work­ers start the mon­i­tor­ing process by clip­ping the Blue­toothen­abled pulse oxime­ter onto their in­dex fin­ger while they are po­si­tioned within 6m of the wire­less node. After 30 seconds, the mea­sure­ment is com­pleted.</p>
    <p>The data is then sent by the wire­less nodes – via Wi-Fi sta­tions – to the cloud for stor­age and dis­played on the dash­board.</p>
    <p>The dash­board can be ac­cessed via a lap­top, tablet or smart­phone and will dis­play the user’s name and pulse oxime­ter read­ings.</p>
    <p>These read­ings will also be colour coded. Green in­di­cates that both the user’s blood oxy­gen and heart rate read­ings are nor­mal. Orange sug­gests that one of the read­ings is ab­nor­mal, while red sig­nals that both mea­sure­ments are ab­nor­mal.</p>
    <p>The in­di­vid­ual will also re­ceive a text mes­sage on his mo­bile phone about the read­ings and whether they are within the nor­mal range.</p>
    <p>Users can choose to re­ceive mes­sages in English, Chi­nese, Tamil, Ben­gali or Hindi.</p>
    <p>If an ab­nor­mal read­ing is ob­tained, the per­son will be ad­vised to re­take the mea­sure­ment after 30 min­utes.</p>
    <p>If the read­ing is still ab­nor­mal or if he fails to re­take the mea­sure­ment within the hour, he will get another alert to con­tact the rel­e­vant healthcare work­ers for fur­ther ex­am­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>For work­ers in dorms, the dorm op­er­a­tors will also be alerted.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor John Ho from the NUS In­sti­tute for Health In­no­va­tion and Tech­nol­ogy, who is the lead on this project, said: “Our aim is to bring the con­ve­nience of dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy to the pen-and-pa­per process cur­rently be­ing used to take health mea­sure­ments.</p>
    <p>“We hope that the sys­tem helps to ad­dress the chal­lenge of mon­i­tor­ing the health of mi­grant work­ers dur­ing this dif­fi­cult pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>This sys­tem can also be de­ployed in com­mu­nity care fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>To test the ef­fi­cacy of the sys­tem, the NUS team con­ducted a two-month pi­lot pro­gramme in four rooms within a dorm which houses work­ers from Soil­build Con­struc­tion Group.</p>
    <p>The pi­lot in­volved 24 work­ers, all of whom had pre­vi­ously tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>They had to take oxime­ter read­ings four times a day. The re­sults showed that the work­ers could be re­li­ably mon­i­tored, with a com­pli­ance rate of above 85 per cent.</p>
    <p>There was min­i­mal in­ter­ven­tion by dorm op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>Mr Tushar Nath, the dig­i­tal in­no­va­tion lead at Soil­build Con­struc­tion, said: “With the app and dash­board, I can see all the in­for­ma­tion at one go.</p>
    <p>“With many work­ers un­der our care, the sys­tem is able to show im­me­di­ately who needs at­ten­tion, and it is eas­ier for su­per­vi­sors to track the health of their work­ers.”</p>
    <p>Mov­ing for­ward, the NUS team also hopes to add more sen­sors, such as those which mea­sure tem­per­a­ture, to build an in­te­grated health mon­i­tor­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The team also hopes to de­ploy the sys­tem in other worker dor­mi­to­ries and com­mu­nity iso­la­tion fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeoh Keat Chuan, se­nior man­ag­ing di­rec­tor at the En­ter­prise Developmen­t Group in Te­masek, said: “The abil­ity to re­motely mon­i­tor oxy­gen lev­els of large groups of peo­ple in a timely man­ner is es­pe­cially per­ti­nent to pro­vide busi­nesses with peace of mind as the economy re­opens.”</p>
