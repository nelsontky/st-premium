    <p>The waltz is back but not yet the spring in the step. One year af­ter the world’s first cases of Covid-19 were re­ported in Wuhan, scars re­main, un­der a ve­neer of nor­malcy. China Cor­re­spon­dent EL­IZ­A­BETH LAW re­ports af­ter a re­turn trip to the cen­tral Chi­nese city.</p>
    <p>MADAM XIE SHUIXIANG, a pork whole­saler who man­ages a small shop with her hus­band Tao Xianggen and six staff.</p>
    <p>On a rainy Sun­day evening, a line of about 100 cars is at a stand­still wait­ing to en­ter an up­scale mall in the Guanggu dis­trict east of Wuhan.</p>
    <p>In­side, shop­pers browse the mall’s of­fer­ings, join­ing a snaking queue for bub­ble tea while par­ents look on as their chil­dren play with an in­ter­ac­tive art ex­hibit.</p>
    <p>Many are in masks but some have them pulled down be­low their chins. A mid­dle-aged shop­per hacks and spits into a nearby bin, miss­ing spec­tac­u­larly.</p>
    <p>Nearly a year af­ter a mys­te­ri­ous pneu­mo­nia ap­peared in a Wuhan seafood mar­ket, life has largely re­turned to nor­mal in the cen­tral Chi­nese city, even as the rest of the world bat­tles the deadly pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But be­neath the ve­neer of nor­malcy, scars re­main: in the masks that have be­come com­mon­place, the use of “health codes” to en­ter places, and the miss­ing fam­ily mem­bers around din­ing ta­bles.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy, hav­ing staged a re­mark­able come­back ear­lier in the year, is now strug­gling to keep up the mo­men­tum.</p>
    <p>And nearly 12 months on, ques­tions about the virus’ ori­gin and its spread still re­main unan­swered.</p>
    <p>FEAR OF AN­OTHER WAVE</p>
    <p>In late Jan­uary, af­ter re­al­is­ing the scale of the out­break, Wuhan went into an emer­gency lock­down that dragged on for 76 days. No one was al­lowed to leave home, let alone the city, as schools, fac­to­ries and shops were or­dered to shut.</p>
    <p>Af­ter it was lifted on April 8, fears of a sec­ond wave arose when a clus­ter of cases was re­ported in May, prompt­ing the city to or­der mass test­ing for all 11 mil­lion res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Since then, the worry has been in­ter­mit­tent, with traces of the coro­n­avirus show­ing up on im­ported frozen food, and as cases con­tinue to sur­face in pock­ets in cities such as Tian­jin and Chengdu.</p>
    <p>Mask-wear­ing and dis­in­fec­tion have be­come a part of daily life, along with the use of “health codes”, con­tact-trac­ing ap­plets that are hosted on the ubiq­ui­tous WeChat and Ali­pay plat­forms.</p>
    <p>But while the worst ap­pears to be over, the ex­pe­ri­ence of the lock­down, of not know­ing when it would end, or what to­mor­row would bring, still haunts Wuhan res­i­dent Zhang Yingyue.</p>
    <p>She had come back from Sin­ga­pore to visit her par­ents for the Chi­nese New Year hol­i­days, and could not leave for close to five months be­cause of the lock­down and in­ter­na­tional travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms Zhang, 46, lost her job as an ad­min­is­tra­tor in Sin­ga­pore and now works as a house­keeper in Wuhan.</p>
    <p>“We don’t talk about it openly be­cause us Wuhan peo­ple are stub­born but the fear is there, es­pe­cially now that it’s win­ter again,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Of course the gov­ern­ment is bet­ter at con­trol­ling the sit­u­a­tion be­cause we’ve dealt with it for so long, but re­mem­ber­ing those early days of not know­ing any­thing... that sort of hap­less­ness still scares me a lot.”</p>
    <p>She still shud­ders at the mem­ory of the or­der to close the city. Though the Wuhan gov­ern­ment gave the or­der in the wee hours of Jan 23, the lock­down did not take ef­fect un­til 10am, re­sult­ing in panic-stricken thou­sands flee­ing the city with­out any screen­ing.</p>
    <p>In Wuhan, peo­ple fear­ing an acute short­age of food and med­i­cal sup­plies rushed to empty the shelves of stores, not know­ing when they would be re­stocked.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Zhang, who stayed the whole time with her par­ents: “We knew we prob­a­bly wouldn’t starve to death, but just not hav­ing any con­trol over some­thing ba­sic like what you could eat, that was very frus­trat­ing.</p>
    <p>“Some days I still have night­mares about hav­ing to eat tinned food, which I re­ally hate. When I wake up, I or­der a big meal de­liv­ery to make up for it, not be­cause I’m hun­gry but be­cause I can.”</p>
    <p>In China’s bat­tle against the coro­n­avirus, Wuhan bore the brunt. Over 86,000 peo­ple in the coun­try have con­tracted the ill­ness, of whom 50,300 were in Wuhan. A bulk of virus-re­lated deaths – 3,869 out of 4,755 – were in the city.</p>
    <p>And it is still rav­aging the city. Re­search has shown that dis­as­ters such as epi­demics, which can quickly over­whelm com­mu­ni­ties and crip­ple their abil­ity to re­spond, can leave long-last­ing men­tal health im­pacts on both front­line work­ers and sur­vivors.</p>
    <p>Coun­sel­lors at the Hubei Prov­ince Coun­sel­lors As­so­ci­a­tion, who set up a well­ness hot­line as soon as the lock­down started, said post­trau­matic stress dis­or­der is likely to man­i­fest in var­i­ous ways in the com­ing months and years.</p>
    <p>The city, too, ap­pears to have been shocked out of com­pla­cency: In early Jan­uary, when The Straits Times first vis­ited Wuhan, res­i­dents in­ter­viewed had dis­missed re­ports of the “mys­te­ri­ous pneu­mo­nia”, say­ing it was a sea­sonal flu. Those wear­ing masks were scoffed at for be­ing para­noid.</p>
    <p>By April, even as the lock­down had been lifted, peo­ple barely batted an eye­lid at pedes­tri­ans dressed in white full-body pro­tec­tive suits.</p>
    <p>When ST vis­ited again late last month, masks were still com­monly seen – al­beit im­prop­erly worn – while hand sani­tiser, dis­in­fec­tant and ther­mome­ters were a com­mon sight in shops, restau­rants and even taxis. Care­ful driv­ers even spritz dis­in­fec­tant on change and re­ceipts from toll booths, one of the few places where cash is still com­monly used.</p>
    <p>EARLY MIS­STEPS</p>
    <p>Across the city, there is ac­cep­tance of the fact that it was here that the virus first spread widely.</p>
    <p>“We can’t es­cape that rep­u­ta­tion, even though the source of the virus is still a mys­tery,” said busi­ness­man Weng Maowei, 60, who has lived here for nearly two decades.</p>
    <p>Where there is lit­tle con­sen­sus is how the virus came about.</p>
    <p>Many be­lieve it orig­i­nated else­where. Some are adamant it came through for­eign sol­diers at­tend­ing mil­i­tary games in Oc­to­ber last</p>
    <p>TOUGH GO­ING</p>
    <p>This is a tough busi­ness to be in. Re­tail sales are hard too, and the pan­demic’s im­pact on our busi­ness has been very big. More­over, dur­ing the pan­demic, peo­ple don’t have much spend­ing power af­ter staying at home most of the year and not earn­ing much.</p>
    <p>DOWN THE DRAIN</p>
    <p>In our brew­ery, we had to pour away a lot of beer be­cause we couldn’t ac­cess the fa­cil­ity dur­ing lock­down, so all that had gone bad, along with raw in­gre­di­ents, which chalked up quite a lot of losses too.</p>
    <p>MR WANG FAN, founder of gas­tropub chain Wuhan No. 18 Brew­ery.</p>
    <p>CUS­TOMERS ALL GONE</p>
    <p>There used to be all th­ese peo­ple from the car busi­ness or lo­gis­tics busi­ness who would come and eat, peo­ple from the south or over­seas, they un­der­stand Can­tonese food. But now, they’re all gone.</p>
    <p>MADAM WANG JING, a restau­rant owner.</p>
    <p>year, while oth­ers be­lieve it es­caped from a Chi­nese lab.</p>
    <p>But even though the ori­gins of the virus are murky, peo­ple agree on one thing – that the gov­ern­ment bun­gled its early re­sponse to the out­break.</p>
    <p>One of the ear­li­est cases, seafood mer­chant Wei Guix­ian, started to feel sick on Dec 10 and was treated at a lo­cal clinic be­fore she went back to work at the Hua­nan mar­ket. Eight days later, she was barely con­scious in a hos­pi­tal bed, fighting for her life.</p>
    <p>By Dec 31, doctors in Wuhan knew they had a new coro­n­avirus on their hands, but the fact that it was spread­ing be­tween hu­mans was not made known to the pub­lic for an­other two weeks.</p>
    <p>And it was not un­til Jan 19 that Bei­jing dis­patched epi­demi­ol­o­gists to in­ves­ti­gate the out­break. By then, nearly 200 peo­ple had fallen ill and two had died.</p>
    <p>Dr Zhong Nan­shan, who headed China’s Covid-19 re­sponse task force, said later that had ac­tion been taken in De­cem­ber or even early Jan­uary, “the num­ber of sick would have been greatly re­duced”.</p>
    <p>OVER­WHELMED SYS­TEM</p>
    <p>By end-Jan­uary, Wuhan’s hos­pi­tals were over­whelmed, with front-line med­i­cal staff of­ten work­ing dou­ble shifts. Pro­tec­tive gear was also in short sup­ply, with some reusing masks and even re­sort­ing to putting trash bags over their cloth­ing when they ran out of pro­tec­tive suits.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary, the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties re­ported that at least 3,300 med­i­cal work­ers had been in­fected, most of them in Hubei prov­ince, of which Wuhan is the cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>It high­lighted the strain that the health­care sys­tem was un­der, and the acute lack of re­sources. Th­ese prob­lems prompted the cen­tral gov­ern­ment to send 42,000 re­in­force­ment medics from across the coun­try and the mil­i­tary to the prov­ince.</p>
    <p>To cope with a mas­sive short­age of hos­pi­tal beds, two brand-new hos­pi­tals – Hu­oshen­shan and Leishen­shan – were built in just 10 days. Con­ven­tion cen­tres and sports halls were also con­verted into tem­po­rary hos­pi­tals for pa­tients with milder symp­toms.</p>
    <p>But dozens of med­i­cal staff suc­cumbed to the ill­ness.</p>
    <p>One of them was oph­thal­mol­o­gist Li Wen­liang, who was among eight peo­ple probed by po­lice in early Jan­uary for “spread­ing ru­mours” – they were in fact doctors warn­ing col­leagues of the new virus.</p>
    <p>Dr Li caught the virus from a pa­tient but con­tin­ued post­ing on so­cial me­dia be­fore suc­cumb­ing to Covid-19 on Feb 7 at the age of 33.</p>
    <p>His death sparked a huge wave of pub­lic anger across the coun­try at the gov­ern­ment’s mis­han­dling of the virus, and peo­ple ac­cused it of down­play­ing the sever­ity of the dis­ease and stag­ing a cover-up. The num­ber of an­gry com­ments over­whelmed cen­sors, who strug­gled to delete crit­i­cal re­marks.</p>
    <p>On his Weibo page, where Dr Li first started post­ing about his ill­ness, hun­dreds of thou­sands have flooded his last post with com­ments, a me­mo­rial that also serves as a cathar­tic out­let in a coun­try with lit­tle room for ex­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>“Dr Li, I was quite tired at work to­day, I’m plan­ning to take a nap be­fore con­tin­u­ing my night work. How are you over there? Take care and keep warm, don’t get a chill,” read one com­ment.</p>
    <p>So far, there have been over one mil­lion com­ments, with sev­eral new posts ev­ery hour.</p>
    <p>SLUG­GISH ECON­OMY</p>
    <p>On pa­per, Wuhan ap­pears to have bounced back in a big way: The econ­omy con­tracted 10 per cent in the first three quar­ters of the year, a ster­ling come­back from the 40.5 per cent plunge in the first quar­ter, when fac­to­ries were shut and all con­struc­tion projects halted.</p>
    <p>In a bid to drive up do­mes­tic con­sump­tion, the gov­ern­ment has also given out con­sump­tion vouchers en­cour­ag­ing res­i­dents to sup­port the lo­cal econ­omy.</p>
    <p>But busi­ness own­ers say the ef­fects have been short-lived.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a spike in sales in July and Au­gust, around the time the vouchers were handed out, sales have started to ta­per off.</p>
    <p>Restau­rant owner Wang Jing, 66, who runs a Can­tonese eatery in the heart of the city, said she strug­gles to fill even half her restau­rant on week­ends.</p>
    <p>Re­cov­ery is ham­pered by the pan­demic still rag­ing in many other parts of the world, drag­ging down economies and clos­ing bor­ders. The main clien­tele for Madam Wang’s restau­rant are busi­ness trav­ellers, who have not re­turned to China in any mean­ing­ful way.</p>
    <p>While Wuhan is a ma­jor au­to­mo­tive and lo­gis­tics hub, French car­maker Re­nault said in April that it was pulling out of a joint ven­ture in the city fol­low­ing poor sales.</p>
    <p>On the street out­side Madam Wang’s restau­rant, at least three shops have shut­tered since April. Malls have units that have been va­cant for months.</p>
    <p>For pork whole­saler Xie Shuixiang, 46, the state of the econ­omy is ev­i­dent in her cus­tomers’ pur­chases.</p>
    <p>Fac­to­ries and school can­teens have ei­ther stopped op­er­a­tions or are re­duc­ing their or­ders to save cost, while re­tail sales have dipped as Covid-con­scious cus­tomers turn to e-com­merce, she said.</p>
    <p>“More­over, dur­ing the pan­demic, peo­ple don’t have much spend­ing power af­ter staying at home most of the year and not earn­ing much.”</p>
    <p>“It’s very hard (keep­ing a busi­ness go­ing) but we have no choice,” she added. “We just have to get on with it.”</p>
    <p>But at the Wuhan No. 18 Brew­ery, which has one of its five gas­trop­ubs in the Guanggu mall, busi­ness has started to pick up af­ter a rough few months.</p>
    <p>When the lock­down was first lifted and eater­ies were al­lowed to serve only take­out or­ders, Wuhan No. 18’s tak­ings dwin­dled to just 3 per cent of its usual amount, said owner Wang Fan, 36.</p>
    <p>His busi­ness would have folded dur­ing the out­break if not for the sup­port of other bar own­ers who held pro­mo­tional events to sup­port the brew­ery.</p>
    <p>But as the curbs eased, cus­tomers re­turned. On a Sun­day evening, at least a dozen cus­tomers were wait­ing for a ta­ble at the 50-seater eatery where beers start at 35 yuan (S$7) and a burger goes for 78 yuan.</p>
    <p>“I think no mat­ter what hap­pens, the peo­ple of Wuhan still do like com­ing out to spend money,” Mr Wang said.</p>
