    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans aged 18 and above this year will re­ceive $100 each to spend on stay­ca­tions, tick­ets to leisure at­trac­tions and lo­cal tours, in a move to stim­u­late do­mes­tic spend­ing and save jobs in the tourism sec­tor. The vouch­ers will be ac­ces­si­ble via SingPass from De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans aged 18 and above this year will re­ceive $100 each to spend on stay­ca­tions, tick­ets to leisure at­trac­tions and lo­cal tours, in a move to stim­u­late do­mes­tic spend­ing and save jobs in the tourism sec­tor.</p>
    <p>The dig­i­tal Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers Vouch­ers will be ac­ces­si­ble via SingPass from De­cem­ber and can be used to off­set ticket pur­chases and ho­tel stays un­til the end of June next year. Per­ma­nent res­i­dents will not be el­i­gi­ble for the vouch­ers.</p>
    <p>Adult Sin­ga­pore­ans will also be able to pur­chase up to six sub­sidised tick­ets for at­trac­tions and tours – each at $10 off – for those un­der 18.</p>
    <p>An­nounc­ing the de­tails yes­ter­day, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said the du­ra­tion of the voucher pro­gramme is timed to co­in­cide with the March, June and De­cem­ber school hol­i­days, and to spread out de­mand in be­tween.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive is not a so­cial as­sis­tance scheme, he stressed.</p>
    <p>“This is an eco­nomic scheme to help our tourist at­trac­tions pre­serve their ca­pa­bil­i­ties that have been built up over the years while they con­sol­i­date ca­pac­ity in the in­terim,” Mr Chan told re­porters dur­ing a visit to Jurong Bird Park.</p>
    <p>The $320 mil­lion Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers Vouch­ers scheme was first an­nounced last month and forms part of the Gov­ern­ment’s ef­forts to prop up the tourism sec­tor, which has been dec­i­mated by travel re­stric­tions amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The vouch­ers, which will come in de­nom­i­na­tions of $10, can be used at all li­censed ho­tels, leisure at­trac­tions and for lo­cal tours by op­er­a­tors that have re­ceived ap­proval from the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) to re­open or re­sume.</p>
    <p>There are cur­rently 214 ho­tels, 40 at­trac­tions and 438 tour itin­er­ar­ies that have been given the green light to re­sume op­er­a­tions with safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place. They in­clude Sin­ga­pore’s four wildlife parks, a num­ber of ac­tiv­i­ties and ho­tels on Sen­tosa and guided tours of Pu­lau Ubin.</p>
    <p>STB also an­nounced that tourist at­trac­tions can ap­ply to in­crease their op­er­at­ing ca­pac­ity to 50 per cent – up from the cur­rent 25 per cent – from to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Gar­dens by the Bay and park op­er­a­tor Wildlife Re­serves Sin­ga­pore are among those plan­ning to do so.</p>
    <p>The move to get Sin­ga­pore­ans to sup­port lo­cal busi­nesses is gath­er­ing pace, with the lat­est move com­ple­ment­ing the $45 mil­lion Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers mar­ket­ing cam­paign, launched in July to pro­mote hol­i­days at home. The vouch­ers will pro­vide added in­cen­tive for Sin­ga­pore­ans to re­dis­cover their back­yard, STB said.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan added that while there are other sup­port schemes for tourism busi­nesses, the vouch­ers will en­cour­age con­sumers to sup­port fel­low cit­i­zens em­ployed in the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>He said busi­nesses out­side the tourism sec­tor are ex­pected to see a boost as well, as spend­ing spills over into food and bev­er­age, for ex­am­ple. “As to the ex­act ex­tent of the cat­alytic ef­fect, it will be a bit hard to pre­dict at this point in time, but we hope that it is at least a few times what we have pro­vided for in the Bud­get,” he added.</p>
    <p>The STB said spe­cific de­tails on how the vouch­ers can be re­deemed will be an­nounced in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>It called a ten­der yes­ter­day to ap­point plat­forms to fa­cil­i­tate the re­demp­tion of vouch­ers.</p>
    <p>While the tourism board ex­pects that the re­demp­tion process “will adopt a dig­i­tal mode by de­fault”, it will pro­vide sup­port for those who have dif­fi­culty us­ing such meth­ods.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers said the $100 cred­its will drive in­ter­est in leisure ac­tiv­i­ties that Sin­ga­pore­ans may have pre­vi­ously over­looked, but op­er­a­tors need to boost their of­fer­ings to spur ad­di­tional out-of-pocket spend­ing.</p>
    <p>HELP FOR TOURIST AT­TRAC­TIONS</p>
    <p>This is an eco­nomic scheme to help our tourist at­trac­tions pre­serve their ca­pa­bil­i­ties that have been built up over the years while they con­sol­i­date ca­pac­ity in the in­terim. ’’</p>
