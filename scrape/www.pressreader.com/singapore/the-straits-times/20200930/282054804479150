    <p>A man died after suf­fer­ing se­vere burns from a fire at a scrap metal fac­tory in Mandai last week.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang Hai Tao, 50, was in­jured in the fire at 228A Mandai Es­tate last Thursday and was rushed to Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal by the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force (SCDF).</p>
    <p>But after fight­ing for his life for three days, the Chi­nese na­tional died on Sunday after­noon.</p>
    <p>SCDF said it was alerted at around 7.10pm to the fire, which in­volved a pile of scrap metal mea­sur­ing about 20m by 20m. The flames were ex­tin­guished us­ing four water jets.</p>
    <p>The fac­tory is the site of World Metal In­dus­tries, which is a gen­eral waste dis­posal fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>The man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of the com­pany, iden­ti­fied only as a Mr Luo, con­firmed with Chi­nese evening daily Lianhe Wan­bao that Mr Wang was an em­ployee.</p>
    <p>Mr Luo said he re­gret­ted the death of Mr Wang and that the com­pany ar­ranged for his friends and fam­ily to say good­bye to him.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing his hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion, we ar­ranged for him to video call his fam­ily in China ev­ery day till his last</p>
    <p>breath,” he told Wan­bao. “His col­leagues and friends here were also given the op­por­tu­nity to say their good­byes.”</p>
    <p>Mr Luo de­scribed Mr Wang as a good em­ployee and col­league, and also a re­spon­si­ble fa­ther.</p>
    <p>He added that the com­pany will be mak­ing funeral ar­range­ments with the fam­ily.</p>
    <p>The cause of the fire is un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
