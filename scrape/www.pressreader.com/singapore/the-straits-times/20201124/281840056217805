    <p>WASHINGTON • The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion is close to declar­ing that 89 Chi­nese aero­space and other com­pa­nies have mil­i­tary ties, re­strict­ing them from buy­ing a range of United States goods and tech­nol­ogy, ac­cord­ing to a draft copy of the list seen by Reuters.</p>
    <p>The list, if pub­lished, could fur­ther es­ca­late trade ten­sions with Bei­jing and hurt US com­pa­nies that sell civil avi­a­tion parts and com­po­nents to China, among other in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the US Depart­ment of Com­merce, which pro­duced the list, de­clined to com­ment. The Chi­nese for­eign min­istry did not re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Com­mer­cial Air­craft Corp of China (Co­mac), which is spear­head­ing Chi­nese ef­forts to com­pete with Boe­ing and Air­bus, is on the list, as is Avi­a­tion In­dus­try Cor­po­ra­tion of China (Avic) and 10 of its re­lated en­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>The list is part of a draft rule that iden­ti­fies Chi­nese and Rus­sian firms the US deems “mil­i­tary end users”, a des­ig­na­tion that means US sup­pli­ers must seek li­cences when sell­ing a broad swathe of com­mer­cially avail­able items to them.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the rule, ap­pli­ca­tions for such li­cences are more likely to be de­nied than granted.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has stepped up his ac­tions in re­cent months against China. Ten days ago, he un­veiled an ex­ec­u­tive or­der pro­hibit­ing US in­vest­ments in Chi­nese com­pa­nies that Washington says are owned or con­trolled by the Chi­nese mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>The pend­ing list comes af­ter the Com­merce Depart­ment ex­panded the def­i­ni­tion of “mil­i­tary end user” in April.</p>
    <p>The April rule in­cludes not only armed ser­vice and na­tional po­lice, but also any per­son or en­tity that sup­ports or con­trib­utes to the main­te­nance or pro­duc­tion of mil­i­tary items – even if their busi­ness is pri­mar­ily non-mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>The ex­port curb ap­plies to items as dis­parate as com­puter soft­ware like word pro­cess­ing, sci­en­tific equip­ment like dig­i­tal os­cil­lo­scopes, and air­craft parts.</p>
    <p>In terms of air­craft, the items in­clude ev­ery­thing from brack­ets for flight con­trol boxes to the en­gines them­selves.</p>
    <p>News of the list comes at a sen­si­tive time for the US aero­space in­dus­try as Boe­ing seeks Chi­nese ap­proval for its 737 Max af­ter it was cleared by US reg­u­la­tors last week.</p>
    <p>In March last year, China was the first na­tion to ground the jet fol­low­ing two fa­tal crashes and it is al­ready ex­pected to wait months to lift the ban. A spokesman for Boe­ing de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>Washington trade lawyer Kevin Wolf, a for­mer Com­merce of­fi­cial, said the depart­ment had shared the draft rule with a tech­ni­cal ad­vi­sory com­mit­tee of in­dus­try rep­re­sen­ta­tives, and it should have been kept con­fi­den­tial.</p>
    <p>Mr Wolf said the rule and list still could be mod­i­fied and that the clock was run­ning out for it to go into ef­fect un­der the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion since it would need to be cleared and sent to the Fed­eral Regis­ter, the of­fi­cial US pub­li­ca­tion for rules, by mid-De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>In the draft rule seen by Reuters, the Com­merce Depart­ment said be­ing able to con­trol the flow of US tech­nol­ogy to the listed com­pa­nies was “vi­tal for pro­tect­ing US na­tional se­cu­rity in­ter­ests”.</p>
    <p>But a for­mer US of­fi­cial who did not want to be iden­ti­fied said “merely cre­at­ing a list and pop­u­lat­ing it is a provoca­tive act”. An aero­space in­dus­try source said it could spur China to re­tal­i­ate.</p>
    <p>The in­clu­sion of Co­mac would come as a sur­prise to at least one ma­jor US sup­plier, which had de­ter­mined the firm was not a mil­i­tary end user, the in­dus­try source said.</p>
    <p>Gen­eral Elec­tric and Honey­well In­ter­na­tional both sup­ply Co­mac and have joint ven­tures with Avic.</p>
    <p>A GE spokesman said its global joint ven­tures op­er­ate in com­pli­ance with all laws, and that the com­pany has worked to ob­tain li­cences re­lated to mil­i­tary end users. A Honey­well spokesman de­clined to com­ment.</p>
