    <p>Re­cently, sev­eral Sin­ga­pore lead­ers have com­mented on the need to find com­mon ground for sen­si­tive is­sues like race and re­li­gion.</p>
    <p>In Par­lia­ment, Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Ed­u­ca­tion and For­eign Af­fairs Ma­liki Os­man noted that cul­tural and racial dif­fer­ences must be ad­dressed care­fully even as so­ci­ety moves to­wards be­com­ing more in­clu­sive. Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong said it was im­por­tant that young peo­ple be given the space to ex­press their views on is­sues that mat­ter to them, in­clud­ing di­ver­sity and so­cial in­equal­ity.</p>
    <p>Their views fol­lowed sim­i­lar ex­hor­ta­tions – by Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob in her speech at the open­ing of the 14th Par­lia­ment on Aug 24 and by gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials like Min­is­ter for Law and Home Af­fairs K. Shanmugam af­ter the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion, for new ways to have dif­fi­cult con­ver­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>These calls for con­ver­sa­tions are not new. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Gov­ern­ment adopted a more con­sul­ta­tive ap­proach and launched a se­ries of ini­tia­tives to hear cit­i­zens’ views on a wide range of top­ics. Re­mem­ber the Feed­back Unit?</p>
    <p>Since then, pub­lic en­gage­ment has evolved into na­tional pub­lic con­sul­ta­tion ex­er­cises such as The Next Lap, Sin­ga­pore 21, Our Sin­ga­pore Con­ver­sa­tion and seg­ment-spe­cific ones such as the SG­fu­ture di­a­logue se­ries and the Youth Ac­tion Chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>The Next Lap led to a 160-page re­port that mapped out broad plans to make Sin­ga­pore a na­tion of dis­tinc­tion, and Sin­ga­pore 21 ar­tic­u­lated five ideas for the na­tional vi­sion.</p>
    <p>Last year, at his Build­ing Our Fu­ture Sin­ga­pore To­gether di­a­logue, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said that in ad­di­tion to peo­ple’s views be­com­ing more di­verse, Sin­ga­pore­ans also want a change in how they are gov­erned.</p>
    <p>Hard talk</p>
    <p>There is a Chi­nese say­ing</p>
    <p>( ), ku kou liang yao. It trans­lates roughly into “ef­fec­tive medicine is bit­ter in taste”.</p>
    <p>In or­der for dis­cus­sions on po­ten­tial pow­der-keg is­sues to yield tan­gi­ble out­comes – to change at­ti­tudes, be­hav­iour and pol­icy – they have to go be­yond a mere re­hash of con­cerns that have been ar­tic­u­lated in the past.</p>
    <p>Such con­ver­sa­tions will be bit­ter be­cause they will be hard and dis­com­fort­ing. But they are pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Since 2017, I have worked with dif­fer­ent agen­cies on de­vel­op­ing cit­i­zens’ pan­els us­ing de­lib­er­a­tive prin­ci­ples. The pan­els tack­led is­sues such as fight­ing di­a­betes, re­cy­cling right and im­prov­ing work-life har­mony.</p>
    <p>I saw how con­ver­sa­tions can be de­signed to en­gen­der im­pact at the pol­icy and per­sonal lev­els. More im­por­tantly, I wit­nessed how ev­ery­one can make a dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Cit­i­zens’ pan­els have sev­eral key fea­tures. First, they have a clear task or pur­pose re­lat­ing to a spe­cific pol­icy or de­ci­sion. Sec­ond, they fa­cil­i­tate dis­cus­sions and ed­u­cate par­tic­i­pants through in­ter­ac­tive events.</p>
    <p>Spe­cial­ists or ex­perts share re­sources and in­for­ma­tion, so that par­tic­i­pants can craft in­formed views. Par­tic­i­pants de­lib­er­ate over mul­ti­ple ses­sions that span sev­eral weeks, some­times months.</p>
    <p>Be­sides ex­chang­ing views, par­tic­i­pants have to en­gage one another, as­sess trade-offs and ar­rive at a con­sen­sus.</p>
    <p>Three prin­ci­ples</p>
    <p>I be­lieve they have suc­ceeded be­cause they are in­clu­sive, fair and ev­i­dence-based. These three prin­ci­ples can help guide the dif­fi­cult con­ver­sa­tions Sin­ga­pore­ans will need to have in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>IN­CLU­SIVE­NESS</p>
    <p>Hav­ing par­tic­i­pants able to of­fer a wide range of views is cen­tral to the cit­i­zens’ panel process.</p>
    <p>It does not mean large num­bers of peo­ple as cit­i­zens’ pan­els re­quire more gran­u­lar dis­cus­sions among small groups, which can range in size from 40 to 70 par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers take care to en­sure there is di­verse rep­re­sen­ta­tion of de­mo­graph­ics and ex­pe­ri­ences so that dif­fer­ent views will be heard and con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>“Inclusivit­y” is there­fore pri­ori­tised over “rep­re­sen­ta­tion” be­cause re­cruit­ing a rep­re­sen­ta­tive sam­ple would re­quire a much larger, ran­domly se­lected group.</p>
    <p>The war on di­a­betes panel, for ex­am­ple, com­prised peo­ple with dif­fer­ent di­a­betic con­di­tions, care­givers and health­care work­ers. The last group was made up of doc­tors, nurses, psy­chol­o­gists, di­eti­tians and a tra­di­tional Chi­nese medicine prac­ti­tioner.</p>
    <p>The cit­i­zens’ panel on work-life har­mony in­volved peo­ple in dif­fer­ent oc­cu­pa­tions and from com­pa­nies of dif­fer­ent sizes, to­gether with free­lancers, re­tirees, home­mak­ers and care­givers.</p>
    <p>Bring­ing to­gether peo­ple from dis­parate cir­cum­stances com­pels them to con­front the dif­fi­cul­ties faced by oth­ers that may be un­known to them.</p>
    <p>This process also helps to mod­er­ate voices that are per­ceived to be “ex­treme” and those which tend to dom­i­nate a con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>I have ob­served that in a face-to-face set­ting, peo­ple are likely to prac­tise some de­gree of self-mod­er­a­tion. While a per­son may hold strong po­si­tions at the start, the process of de­lib­er­at­ing with oth­ers helps to cul­ti­vate in­tro­spec­tion and em­pa­thy.</p>
    <p>EQUAL­ITY</p>
    <p>To yield tan­gi­ble out­comes, par­tic­i­pants must also have equal op­por­tu­ni­ties to place their con­cerns and ideas on the agenda.</p>
    <p>Process or, in this case, con­ver­sa­tion de­sign, is key.</p>
    <p>Fa­cil­i­ta­tors, whose im­por­tance is of­ten over­looked, play a vi­tal role. They make sure ev­ery­one par­tic­i­pates. By elic­it­ing as many views as pos­si­ble and in­ter­ven­ing only when nec­es­sary, fa­cil­i­ta­tors cre­ate a level play­ing field among par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>In the three cit­i­zens’ pan­els I was in­volved in, small group dis­cus­sions en­abled deep dives into pol­icy prob­lems and the gath­er­ing of ev­i­dence, while col­lec­tive or panel-wide ac­tiv­i­ties al­lowed for feed­back from other par­tic­i­pants and con­sid­er­a­tion of is­sues that the group might have over­looked.</p>
    <p>EV­I­DENCE-BASED</p>
    <p>While cit­i­zens’ pan­els are meant to be in­clu­sive, they can eas­ily lapse into an air­ing of per­sonal and in­su­lar views. This can be avoided if ac­cu­rate and rel­e­vant in­for­ma­tion is made avail­able to all par­tic­i­pants, ac­cord­ing to po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist James Fishkin, known for his work on de­lib­er­a­tive democ­racy.</p>
    <p>In the cit­i­zens’ pan­els I was in­volved in, in­for­ma­tion kits were sent to par­tic­i­pants prior to the start of the process.</p>
    <p>The shar­ing of data that is not pub­licly avail­able and dis­cus­sions with sub­ject mat­ter ex­perts at dif­fer­ent junc­tures of the process made the con­ver­sa­tions broader and more mean­ing­ful.</p>
    <p>In the case of the re­cy­cle-right panel, the then Min­istry of the En­vi­ron­ment and Wa­ter Re­sources also or­gan­ised learn­ing jour­neys to the ma­te­ri­als re­cov­ery fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>Be­ing ex­posed to rel­e­vant in­for­ma­tion helped dis­pel myths about is­sues and par­tic­i­pants were com­pelled to ex­am­ine their own as­sump­tions. They also gained a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of the con­cerns of or­gan­i­sa­tions and in­di­vid­u­als with di­rect ex­pe­ri­ence of the sub­ject mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The out­comes</p>
    <p>So what were the out­comes of such con­ver­sa­tions?</p>
    <p>Be­sides pol­icy rec­om­men­da­tions, some of which have been set in mo­tion, polls con­ducted be­fore and af­ter the pan­els found that the par­tic­i­pants bet­ter un­der­stood the chal­lenges in­volved in mak­ing pol­icy trade-offs and learnt how to ne­go­ti­ate with one another and with ex­ter­nal stake­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>They also de­vel­oped em­pa­thy for those who are dif­fer­ent from them, and be­came more con­fi­dent of their abil­ity to bring about change as cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>I find this last point par­tic­u­larly im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>Mov­ing ahead in these chal­leng­ing times, cit­i­zens must play a big­ger role in shap­ing the kind of so­ci­ety they want, through con­ver­sa­tions that are in­clu­sive, process-driven and in­formed.</p>
    <p>While the cit­i­zens’ panel may not work for all is­sues, it cer­tainly of­fers a use­ful road map for the tough jour­ney ahead.</p>
