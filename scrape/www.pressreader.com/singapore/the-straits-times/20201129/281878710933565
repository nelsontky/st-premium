    <p>Liv­ing in New York and about to com­plete her post-grad­u­ate stud­ies in po­lit­i­cal sci­ence ear­lier this year, Ms Lee Hyun-a was ready to find a job in the Big Ap­ple and start the new chap­ter of her life there.</p>
    <p>Then, Covid-19 reached the United States and the 25-yearold had to re­turn to her home town in South Korea in May.</p>
    <p>“Both daily life and the job mar­ket froze at the same time. I couldn’t stay on and pay rent with­out a job any more, so I came back,” she told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>Now liv­ing with her par­ents, Ms Lee is try­ing to find a job in a non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion, non-profit group, or think-tank.</p>
    <p>She has dreamt of work­ing in the US since she was in high school, lured by bet­ter job op­por­tu­ni­ties, salaries and staff ben­e­fits in her pre­ferred field.</p>
    <p>Her par­ents sup­port her de­ci­sion, as they them­selves had worked and lived in the US for more than 15 years, said Ms Lee.</p>
    <p>Her older sis­ter is a lawyer in New York, and she joined her in 2017 after grad­u­at­ing from col­lege.</p>
    <p>“My par­ents al­ready know there are bet­ter op­por­tu­ni­ties for us in the US,” she said. “Com­pa­nies in the US pay twice as much and they guar­an­tee work-life bal­ance.”</p>
    <p>Ms Lee at­tributes her de­ci­sion to leave her coun­try to “Hell Joseon” – a term that cap­tures the sense of fu­til­ity among young peo­ple who are dis­ap­pointed with South Korea’s rigid cul­ture of hi­er­ar­chy, grow­ing in­equal­ity and high un­em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>“Hell Joseon is quite a sad term for our gen­er­a­tion. Many of us have good tal­ent, but we feel Hell Joseon blocks our op­por­tu­ni­ties,” she lamented.</p>
    <p>“We try re­ally hard to live well, but we feel we have no choice but to give up jobs, mar­riage, dat­ing, ba­bies, and so on, due to cer­tain sit­u­a­tions.”</p>
    <p>Ms Lee started look­ing for a job in Jan­uary, five months be­fore grad­u­at­ing from the City Univer­sity of New York.</p>
    <p>She has since ap­plied to more than 40 or­gan­i­sa­tions – 10 based in the US and the rest in South Korea – and has gone for eight in­ter­views.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee said the pan­demic spoilt all her plans. “Covid af­fected ev­ery­one, but for me, it re­ally changed my whole life.”</p>
