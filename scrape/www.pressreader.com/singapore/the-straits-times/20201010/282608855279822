    <p>Dis­tance-based charg­ing is not new. Bus and train op­er­a­tors have been do­ing it since 2010. Taxi com­pa­nies have been do­ing it for decades.</p>
    <p>And since they ar­rived in 2013, ride-hail­ing firms have been do­ing it – with dy­namic pric­ing thrown in.</p>
    <p>Even mo­tor in­sur­ers do it, by in­tro­duc­ing us­age-based pre­mi­ums which are tied to the dis­tance clocked by an in­sured mem­ber.</p>
    <p>Pol­i­cy­mak­ers, how­ever, feel that motorists are not ready for dis­tance-based con­ges­tion charg­ing.</p>
    <p>So, when the next-gen­er­a­tion Elec­tronic Road Pric­ing – dubbed ERP 2.0 – rolls out in 2023, the half-bil­lion-dol­lar sys­tem will merely mimic its two-decade-old pre­de­ces­sor.</p>
    <p>When its dis­tance-charg­ing func­tion will be switched on is un­known, but Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said dur­ing the Bud­get in Fe­bru­ary that it will be “sev­eral years away”.</p>
    <p>To use an au­to­mo­tive anal­ogy, it is like buy­ing a Fer­rari, only to use it like a Toy­ota.</p>
    <p>Part of the rea­son may have to do with an aver­sion to teething prob­lems. Even though tests have shown that dis­tance-based charg­ing is work­able, real-world con­di­tions in­volv­ing hun­dreds of thou­sands of ve­hi­cles may throw up un­fore­seen sit­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>But like haste, pru­dence has a price, too. By de­lay­ing dis­tance charg­ing – some­thing which pre­vi­ous gov­ern­ments have re­peat­edly touted as a far sharper and fairer tool to charge for con­ges­tion – we may be putting up road­blocks on our path to be­com­ing a car-lite na­tion.</p>
    <p>ERP 2.0 is the first sys­tem of its kind in the world.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem on hand is pro­pri­etory, se­cure, pre­cise and ro­bust – at the ex­pense of sim­plic­ity and sleek­ness. Its back­bone is a global nav­i­ga­tion satel­lite sys­tem, aug­mented by a bat­tery of ded­i­cated short-range com­mu­ni­ca­tions gantries and en­force­ment cam­eras.</p>
    <p>Cars will be fit­ted with a clunky on-board unit made up of three sep­a­rate com­po­nents. Strangely, mo­tor­cy­clists will make do with a one-piece unit.</p>
    <p>Do we need such an in­el­e­gant Fort Knox-style on-board unit, when myr­iad se­cured trans­ac­tions are al­ready tak­ing place on our phones?</p>
    <p>Google Pay, Ap­ple Pay, PayNow and PayLah are some of the mo­bile pay­ment apps that are be­ing used day in, day out here with a high level of trust.</p>
    <p>Park­ing.sg, one of the best mo­tor­ing apps in town, has al­ready usurped one of the func­tions which</p>
    <p>ERP 2.0 was sup­posed to of­fer – coupon-less, gantry-less park­ing.</p>
    <p>Else­where, apps like Google Maps and Waze are al­ready of­fer­ing “live” traf­fic in­for­ma­tion – an­other func­tion of ERP 2.0.</p>
    <p>If the phone is able to do all this, can it also ac­com­mo­date an ERP 2.0 app?</p>
    <p>Sure, no tech is ever per­fect and there will be some in­ac­cu­ra­cies.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion is, are we sat­is­fied with a 0.003 per cent er­ror rate (the cur­rent sys­tem’s fig­ure) or a 0.03 per cent rate?</p>
    <p>Note, too, that most of the er­rors in the cur­rent static ERP sys­tem are at­trib­uted to the in-ve­hi­cle unit and stored-value cards. Re­move these com­po­nents and the er­ror rate is likely to fall.</p>
    <p>Granted the au­thor­i­ties’ aim to have a pin­point ac­cu­rate sys­tem is well-in­tended – no­ble, even – but a tad mis­placed. No one can real­is­ti­cally come up with a sys­tem which is ut­terly un­wa­ver­ing when the very na­ture of traf­fic is wa­ver­ing.</p>
    <p>In other words, an of­fice com­mute can cost $4.50 one day, $5.30 the next day and $3.80 the fol­low­ing day.</p>
    <p>It all de­pends on traf­fic vol­ume, which is ever-chang­ing. Also, the ac­tual vol­ume at any given point in time also varies ac­cord­ing to the num­ber of motorists who are will­ing to pay the pre­vail­ing charges to drive to a par­tic­u­lar des­ti­na­tion.</p>
    <p>To ar­rive at the right prices so that roads are used op­ti­mally is thus as much an art as it is a sci­ence. Lean­ing to­wards the lat­ter may re­sult in an over-en­gi­neered so­lu­tion which will fail if it were a com­mer­cial en­tity in a com­pet­i­tive mar­ket­place.</p>
    <p>Which is pre­cisely what the three-piece on-board unit is.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment says it is study­ing if smart­phones can do the job of the on-board unit. Strange that it is do­ing so only now, when smart­phones have been around for 20 years and phone apps, more than 10. But bet­ter late than never.</p>
    <p>Hope­fully, a phone-based so­lu­tion – wire­less, card-less and a lot smarter – can emerge and we can dis­pense with the un­wieldy three-piece on-board unit.</p>
    <p>When an en­gi­neer­ing stal­wart like SMRT can re­place the dated mo­bile dis­play ter­mi­nals em­ployed in its taxi fleet with a Grab app, there is hope yet.</p>
    <p>Be­yond ex­ter­nal hard­ware and apps, dis­tance charg­ing could well have been fa­cil­i­tated by at­tach­ing a com­mu­ni­ca­tion de­vice to a ve­hi­cle’s en­gine con­trol unit (ECU or its cen­tral com­puter).</p>
    <p>Cars are in­creas­ingly dig­i­tal and con­nected. Even if some­one tries to tam­per with the trip meter of such a car, the ECU keeps track of the dis­tance it has clocked.</p>
    <p>An ERP sys­tem which taps into an ECU would be sim­ple, ac­cu­rate and in­ex­pen­sive. Charges for var­i­ous jour­neys can be flashed on the driver’s phone be­fore he sets off, al­low­ing for bet­ter de­ci­sion­mak­ing.</p>
    <p>Such a sys­tem would ad­here to the tenet of con­ges­tion pric­ing, with­out the need for un­sightly street fur­ni­ture or on-board units.</p>
    <p>It would also be part of the In­ter­net of Things, which a smart na­tion should as­pire to­wards.</p>
