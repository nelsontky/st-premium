    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Bac­calau­re­ate Diploma Pro­gramme (IBDP) and the A lev­els are both two-year­long pro­grammes that cater mainly to stu­dents be­tween 16 and 18 years old.</p>
    <p>In Singapore, more stu­dents tend to opt for the A-level route. In 2019, 12,405 stu­dents sat the na­tional exam.</p>
    <p>A-level stu­dents are graded al­most en­tirely on their fi­nal ex­ams, which tend to be con­tent-heavy.</p>
    <p>The IBDP is con­sid­ered a less fre­quently cho­sen op­tion. Last year, 2,228 stu­dents from Singapore, in­clud­ing those from schools such as An­glo-Chi­nese School (In­de­pen­dent) and St Joseph’s In­sti­tu­tion (SJI), sat the diploma exam in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Each year, there is another sit­ting in May, taken mainly by in­ter­na­tional schools in Singapore.</p>
    <p>In the IBDP, the fi­nal IB ex­ams ac­count for about 70 per cent to 80 per cent of the to­tal mark for each sub­ject, while as­sign­ments as­sessed by teach­ers and checked by ex­ter­nal ex­am­in­ers con­trib­ute the rest of the fi­nal grade, ac­cord­ing to a note on SJI’s web­site.</p>
    <p>The cur­ricu­lum places em­pha­sis on the re­search pro­cesses of the stu­dents, as well as on their in­quiry and prob­lem-solv­ing skills.</p>
    <p>Other key ex­ter­nal as­sess­ments are the the­ory of knowl­edge es­say and the in­di­vid­ual ex­tended es­say, which are com­pleted by stu­dents over a spec­i­fied pe­riod of time un­der teacher su­per­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Sean Lim, a tu­tor at Quin­tes­sen­tial Ed­u­ca­tion, which of­fers tu­ition for IB stu­dents, said IB cov­er­age is more ex­ten­sive, but the fi­nal ex­ams tend to be less chal­leng­ing than the A lev­els.</p>
    <p>“Chil­dren who are more ex­am­savvy might do bet­ter in the Alevel ex­ams... The IB ex­ams ben­e­fit stu­dents who are good at time man­age­ment, in­de­pen­dent learn­ing and re­search,” he said.</p>
    <p>Na­tional In­sti­tute of Ed­u­ca­tion don Jason Tan said one key dif­fer­ence be­tween the two routes is that the IBDP man­dates that stu­dents take a broader spread of sub­jects across dis­ci­plinary ar­eas.</p>
    <p>The A-level route re­quires stu­dents to take at least one con­trast­ing sub­ject. Many arts stu­dents tend to choose math­e­mat­ics, while science stu­dents tend to choose eco­nomics, he said.</p>
    <p>The IBDP has six sub­ject groups: stud­ies in lan­guage and lit­er­a­ture; lan­guage ac­qui­si­tion; in­di­vid­u­als and so­ci­eties; sci­ences; math­e­mat­ics; and the arts. Stu­dents can choose cour­ses from th­ese six groups.</p>
    <p>How­ever, they may opt to study an ad­di­tional sci­ences, in­di­vid­u­als and so­ci­eties, or languages course, in­stead of a course in the arts.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Tan said: “But even if you forgo the arts, you still have a spread across var­i­ous fields. Com­pared with what Alevel stu­dents take, it’s a wider spread across at least five dif­fer­ent sub­ject ar­eas.”</p>
