    <p>WIN­NING THE PRES­I­DENCY</p>
    <p>I feel like I’ve done some­thing good for the coun­try by mak­ing sure that Don­ald Trump is not go­ing to be pres­i­dent for four more years...But there’s been no mo­ment of ela­tion... It’s just one of those mo­ments. There’s a lot of work to do.</p>
    <p>I’m just fo­cused on get­ting some things done as quickly as I can.</p>
    <p>WORK­ING WITH REPUB­LI­CANS IN CONGRESS</p>
    <p>There are a num­ber of things when McCon­nell con­trolled the Se­nate that peo­ple said couldn’t get done, and I was able to get them done with (him). I was able to get them to, you know, raise taxes on the wealthy. I think there are trade-offs, that not all com­pro­mise is walk­ing away from prin­ci­ple... He knows me. I know him. I don’t ask him to em­bar­rass him­self to make a deal.</p>
    <p>CHINA POL­ICY</p>
    <p>The best China strat­egy, I think, is one which gets ev­ery one of our – or at least what used to be our – al­lies on the same page. It’s go­ing to be a ma­jor pri­or­ity for me in the open­ing weeks of my pres­i­dency to try to get us back on the same page with our al­lies.</p>
    <p>IRAN POL­ICY</p>
    <p>Look, there’s a lot of talk about pre­ci­sion mis­siles and all range of other things that are desta­bil­is­ing the re­gion... And the last god­damn thing we need in that part of the world is a buildup of nu­clear ca­pa­bil­ity... in con­sul­ta­tion with our al­lies and part­ners, we’re go­ing to en­gage in ne­go­ti­a­tions and fol­low-on agree­ments to tighten and lengthen Iran’s nu­clear con­straints, as well as ad­dress the mis­sile pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den was in a good mood as we talked on the phone on Tues­day even­ing for an hour – he in Delaware and me in Bethesda, Mary­land. He apol­o­gised for be­ing late. He had been fol­low­ing the break­ing news that At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Wil­liam Barr had just an­nounced that the Jus­tice Depart­ment had not un­cov­ered any sig­nif­i­cant fraud that could have af­fected the re­sults of the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion. It’s all over.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den joked that Mr Barr had just called him, “ask­ing if I can get him in the wit­ness pro­tec­tion pro­gramme for en­dors­ing me”.</p>
    <p>Con­sid­er­ing the Trump team’s hur­ri­cane of dis­hon­est claims about the elec­tion re­sults,</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den was en­ti­tled to a lit­tle laugh at their ex­pense. Oth­er­wise, he was all busi­ness.</p>
    <p>He had a lot to say about how he in­tends to ap­proach cur­rent Se­nate ma­jor­ity leader Mitch McCon­nell and his Repub­li­can col­leagues in or­der to get his Cab­i­net nom­i­nees – and as much of his agenda as pos­si­ble – through the Se­nate; how he in­tends to re­shape US-China strat­egy; and why he is ready to re­turn to the Iran nu­clear deal, if Iran does, and end Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s sanc­tions on Iran.</p>
    <p>I did ask one per­sonal ques­tion: What has it been like to win the pres­i­dency un­der such weird cir­cum­stances – with a deadly pan­demic and an in­fo­demic of Trump pro­pa­ganda falsely claim­ing that the elec­tion was rigged?</p>
    <p>“I feel like I’ve done some­thing good for the coun­try by mak­ing sure that Don­ald Trump is not go­ing to be pres­i­dent for four more years,” Mr Bi­den said. “But there’s been no mo­ment of ela­tion. It kind of re­minds me of what’s go­ing on with all my grand­kids. You know, here I got a grand­daugh­ter who grad­u­ates with hon­ours from Columbia. There’s no com­mence­ment. I’m the com­mence­ment speaker. It’s vir­tual. Th­ese kids are grad­u­at­ing with no par­ties. It’s just one of those mo­ments. There’s a lot of work to do. I’m just fo­cused on get­ting some things done as quickly as I can.”</p>
    <p>TOP PRI­OR­ITY: STIM­U­LUS PACK­AGE</p>
    <p>Ex­actly how much he will get done will de­pend to a large de­gree on two things, Mr Bi­den noted. One is how Repub­li­cans in the Se­nate and the House be­have once Mr Trump is truly gone from power. And the other is how Mr McCon­nell be­haves if he con­tin­ues to con­trol the Se­nate.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s top pri­or­ity, he said, is get­ting a gen­er­ous stim­u­lus pack­age through Congress, even be­fore he takes of­fice.</p>
    <p>We are court­ing se­ri­ous long-term eco­nomic harm if we don’t deal with the fact that “you have over 10 mil­lion peo­ple out there who are wor­ried (about how) they can pay their next mort­gage pay­ment” and “you have a sig­nif­i­cantly higher num­ber of peo­ple who have no abil­ity to pay their rent”.</p>
    <p>When peo­ple “are out of the work­force too long, you know, that makes it hell of a lot harder for them to get back in the work­force”, Mr Bi­den said. “Many of them are los­ing years and years of op­por­tu­nity.” The same is true when chil­dren miss sig­nif­i­cant time in school. “They don’t just lose that se­mes­ter,” he said. “They end up some­times two and three years be­hind.”</p>
    <p>A gen­er­ous stim­u­lus will ac­tu­ally gen­er­ate eco­nomic growth with­out long-term fis­cal harm if, in the fu­ture, “ev­ery­body pays their fair share, for God’s sake”, he in­sisted. “And by that fair share, I mean there’s no rea­son why the top tax rate shouldn’t be</p>
    <p>39.6 per cent, which it was in the be­gin­ning of the Bush ad­min­is­tra­tion. There’s no rea­son why 91 For­tune 500 com­pa­nies should be pay­ing zero in taxes.”</p>
    <p>But the big ques­tion is whether he can get it past Mr McCon­nell to­day or to­mor­row if the Repub­li­cans con­tinue to hold the Se­nate. A sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of Repub­li­can se­na­tors could de­cide that they want to be­come deficit hawks again un­der a Pres­i­dent Bi­den, af­ter four years of un­con­trolled spend­ing un­der Mr Trump that has brought the na­tional debt to record highs. “Let me put it this way,” he said. “There are a num­ber of things when McCon­nell con­trolled the Se­nate that peo­ple said couldn’t get done, and I was able to get them done with (him). I was able to get them to, you know, raise taxes on the wealthy.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den added: “I think there are trade-offs, that not all com­pro­mise is walk­ing away from prin­ci­ple... He knows me. I know him. I don’t ask him to em­bar­rass him­self to make a deal.” At the same time, if Repub­li­cans clearly “let all this go down the drain” just so a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will not get a win, that “may have an</p>
    <p>im­pact on the prospect of Repub­li­cans run­ning for re­elec­tion in 2022”.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing been through many po­lit­i­cal sea­sons, Mr Bi­den added, the world could change a lot for Repub­li­can law­mak­ers once Mr Trump is gone, although he cer­tainly will not be for­got­ten. “My favourable rat­ing is now 55 per cent,” he said. “Trump is down to 42 per cent.” A sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of in­de­pen­dents and some Repub­li­cans could start to look at the world very dif­fer­ently in the next few weeks, he said.</p>
    <p>DEAL­ING WITH IRAN</p>
    <p>On for­eign pol­icy, Mr Bi­den made two sig­nif­i­cant points. First, I asked him whether he stood by his views on the Iran nu­clear deal that he ar­tic­u­lated in a Sept 13 es­say on CNN.com. He an­swered: “It’s go­ing to be hard, but yeah.”</p>
    <p>He had writ­ten that “if Iran re­turns to strict com­pli­ance with the nu­clear deal, the United States would re­join the agree­ment as a start­ing point for fol­low-on ne­go­ti­a­tions” and lift the sanc­tions on Iran that Mr Trump im­posed. The Ira­ni­ans are clearly hop­ing for that. Ira­nian For­eign Min­is­ter Javad Zarif said on Nov 17 that a re­turn to full im­ple­men­ta­tion by the United States and Iran can be “done au­to­mat­i­cally” and “needs no ne­go­ti­a­tions”.</p>
    <p>The nu­clear deal – known as the Joint Com­pre­hen­sive Plan of</p>
    <p>Ac­tion – was signed in 2015. Mr Trump uni­lat­er­ally with­drew from it in May 2018, reim­pos­ing crip­pling oil sanc­tions on Iran.</p>
    <p>The view of Mr Bi­den and his na­tional se­cu­rity team is that once the deal is re­stored by both sides, there will have to be, in very short or­der, a round of ne­go­ti­a­tions to seek to lengthen the du­ra­tion of the re­stric­tions on Iran’s pro­duc­tion of fis­sile ma­te­rial that could be used to make a bomb – orig­i­nally 15 years – as well as to ad­dress Iran’s ma­lign re­gional ac­tiv­i­ties, through its prox­ies in Le­banon, Iraq, Syria and Ye­men.</p>
    <p>Ideally, the Bi­den team would like to see that fol­low-on ne­go­ti­a­tion in­clude not only the orig­i­nal sig­na­to­ries to the deal – Iran, the United States, Rus­sia, China, Bri­tain, France, Ger­many and the Euro­pean Union – but also Iran’s Arab neigh­bours, par­tic­u­larly Saudi Ara­bia and the United Arab Emi­rates.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, I wrote that it would be un­wise for the US to give up the lever­age of the Trump-im­posed oil sanc­tions just to re­sume the nu­clear deal where it left off. We should use that lever­age to also get Iran to curb its ex­ports of pre­ci­sion-guided mis­siles to its al­lies in Le­banon, Syria, Ye­men and Iraq, where they threaten Is­rael and sev­eral Arab states.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s team is aware of that ar­gu­ment, but for now, they in­sist that the US’ over­whelm­ing na­tional in­ter­est is to get Iran’s nu­clear</p>
    <p>pro­gramme back un­der con­trol and fully in­spected. In their view, Iran’s de­vel­op­ment of a nu­clear weapon poses a di­rect na­tional se­cu­rity threat to the US and to the global nu­clear weapons con­trol regime. The best way to achieve get­ting some sta­bil­ity in the re­gion, said Mr Bi­den, is to deal with the nu­clear pro­gramme. The US al­ways has the op­tion of snap­ping back sanc­tions if need be, and Iran knows that, he added.</p>
    <p>THE NEW CHINA STRAT­EGY</p>
    <p>On China, Mr Bi­den would not act im­me­di­ately to re­move the</p>
    <p>25 per cent tar­iffs that Mr Trump im­posed on about half of China’s ex­ports to the US – or the phase one agree­ment that re­quires Bei­jing to pur­chase some</p>
    <p>US$200 bil­lion (S$267 bil­lion) in ad­di­tional US goods and ser­vices this year and next year – which China has fallen sig­nif­i­cantly be­hind on.</p>
    <p>“I’m not go­ing to make any im­me­di­ate moves, and the same ap­plies to the tar­iffs,” he said. “I’m not go­ing to prej­u­dice my op­tions.”</p>
    <p>He first wants to con­duct a full re­view of the ex­ist­ing agree­ment with China and con­sult US al­lies in Asia and Europe “so we can de­velop a co­her­ent strat­egy”.</p>
    <p>“The best China strat­egy, I think, is one which gets ev­ery one of our – or at least what used to be our – al­lies on the same page. It’s go­ing to be a ma­jor pri­or­ity for me in the open­ing weeks of my pres­i­dency to try to get us back on the same page with our al­lies.”</p>
    <p>China’s lead­ers had their is­sues with Mr Trump, but they knew that as long as he was pres­i­dent, the US could never gal­vanise a global coali­tion against them. Mr Bi­den’s strat­egy, if he can pull it off, will not be wel­come news for China. While Mr Trump was fo­cused on the trade deficit with China, with lit­tle suc­cess, de­spite his trade war, Mr Bi­den said his “goal would be to pur­sue trade poli­cies that ac­tu­ally pro­duce progress on China’s abu­sive prac­tices – that’s steal­ing in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty, dump­ing prod­ucts, il­le­gal sub­si­dies to cor­po­ra­tions” and forc­ing tech trans­fers from Amer­i­can com­pa­nies to their Chi­nese coun­ter­parts.</p>
    <p>When deal­ing with China, Mr Bi­den con­cluded, it is all about lever­age, and “in my view, we don’t have it yet”.</p>
    <p>Part of gen­er­at­ing more lever­age, though, is de­vel­op­ing a bi­par­ti­san con­sen­sus at home for some good old Amer­i­can in­dus­trial pol­icy – mas­sive, gov­ern­ment-led in­vest­ments in Amer­i­can re­search and de­vel­op­ment, in­fra­struc­ture and ed­u­ca­tion to bet­ter com­pete with China – and not just com­plain­ing about it.</p>
    <p>Both Demo­cratic and</p>
    <p>Repub­li­can se­na­tors have draft Bills call­ing for such a strat­egy. The US semi­con­duc­tor in­dus­try in par­tic­u­lar has been lob­by­ing for such an ap­proach. “I want to make sure we’re go­ing to fight like hell by in­vest­ing in Amer­ica first,” said Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>He ticked off en­ergy, biotech, ad­vanced ma­te­ri­als and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence as ar­eas ripe for large-scale gov­ern­ment in­vest­ment in re­search.</p>
    <p>“I’m not go­ing to en­ter any new trade agree­ment with any­body un­til we have made ma­jor in­vest­ments here at home and in our work­ers” and in ed­u­ca­tion, he said. And this time, he in­sisted, the ru­ral US will not be left be­hind.</p>
    <p>There is no way Democrats can go an­other four years and lose al­most ev­ery ru­ral county in the US. For their sake and the coun­try’s, Democrats have to fig­ure out what is go­ing on there and speak to ru­ral vot­ers more ef­fec­tively.</p>
    <p>“It re­ally does go to the is­sue of dig­nity, how you treat peo­ple,” Mr Bi­den said. “I think they just feel for­got­ten. I think we for­got them.”</p>
    <p>He added: “I re­spect them.” He plans to prove it by tack­ling the virus in red and blue ar­eas alike. “We have got to re­build the mid­dle class,” he said, but “es­pe­cially in ru­ral Amer­ica”.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den closed by re­flect­ing on the ug­li­ness of the past four years – first see­ing the glass half empty but then de­cid­ing in the end that, who knows, maybe it’s half full. “Seventy-two mil­lion peo­ple is a lot of peo­ple to vote for” Mr</p>
    <p>Trump, he said. But maybe, just maybe, when he is gone from the im­me­di­ate scene, “I’m not so sure that ug­li­ness stays. There may be 20 per cent of it, 25 per cent of it, I don’t know”.</p>
    <p>But some por­tion has to come back to a place where Amer­i­cans can col­lab­o­rate. “We got to fig­ure out how to work to­gether,” Mr Bi­den said. Oth­er­wise, “we’re in real trou­ble”.</p>
