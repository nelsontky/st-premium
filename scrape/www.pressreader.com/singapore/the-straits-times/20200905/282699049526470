    <p>Step­ping into this light-filled home with open spa­ces and a lofty feel, it is hard to imag­ine that it used to be dark and op­pres­sive.</p>
    <p>The orig­i­nal in­te­rior was very com­part­men­talised, the ceil­ing was low and the nat­u­ral light com­ing in from the small win­dows was lim­ited.</p>
    <p>When the own­ers pur­chased this semi-de­tached unit off Hol­land Road in 2017, they en­vi­sioned a hygge (a Dan­ish catch-all term for all things com­fort­able and which im­parts a sense of cosi­ness) home for them and their three chil­dren.</p>
    <p>The wife says: “We wanted an invit­ing place where we could make mem­o­ries as a fam­ily and en­ter­tain our friends.”</p>
    <p>The task of trans­form­ing the home fell on Mr Hsu Hsia Pin, Ms Eu­nice Khoo and Mr Amoz Boon from home-grown ar­chi­tec­tural prac­tice Ehka Stu­dio.</p>
    <p>“Our ap­proach em­braces the ex­ist­ing struc­ture and ex­poses it in­stead of try­ing to con­ceal it,” says Mr Hsu, a part­ner at the firm.</p>
    <p>The project was clas­si­fied as a re­con­struc­tion be­cause it in­volved ma­jor ad­di­tions and al­ter­ation work. The de­sign, sub­mis­sions and ten­der took seven months, while the con­struc­tion was com­pleted in about a year. The own­ers de­clined to re­veal the cost of the project.</p>
    <p>An ex­ten­sion up­front cre­ates a larger liv­ing area in the 3,300 sq ft home that opens out to a new gar­den pa­tio.</p>
    <p>A void was in­tro­duced in the slab above the liv­ing area to es­tab­lish a con­nec­tion with the fam­ily area on the se­cond storey.</p>
    <p>The dou­ble-vol­ume space adds a ver­ti­cal di­men­sion to the spa­tial flow and al­lows light to fil­ter into the heart of the home from the sky­light above the stair­well.</p>
    <p>To op­ti­mise the re­la­tion­ship be­tween the din­ing area and the kitchen, the po­si­tions of the orig­i­nal kitchen and guest room were changed so that the new kitchen is now ad­ja­cent to the din­ing area. Func­tion­ally, this achieves a much bet­ter flow.</p>
    <p>Full-height slid­ing glass doors that ex­tend the length of the din­ing area re­placed the old win­dows. “These al­low more light and air into the deeper re­cesses of the in­te­rior, as well as form a link with the side gar­den,” Mr Hsu points out.</p>
    <p>On the se­cond level are three bed­rooms be­long­ing to the chil­dren, a 14-year-old boy and two girls aged seven and five.</p>
    <p>The rooms are ar­ranged around a fam­ily area, where they can watch tele­vi­sion or use the com­puter. It is also where the mis­sus does her craft­ing.</p>
    <p>The at­tic is a new ad­di­tion to the ex­ist­ing two-storey prop­erty. It houses the mas­ter suite, com­pris­ing the bed­room, bath­room and a walk-in wardrobe. The pitched roof and am­ple head­room give the space a bright, airy feel.</p>
    <p>One of the key de­sign fea­tures of the mas­ter bath­room is the way the bath­tub opens out to an ex­ter­nal planter.</p>
    <p>“We wanted a well-ven­ti­lated, spa­cious bath­room that’s com­fort­able and re­lax­ing,” says Mr Hsu. The team ad­dressed the is­sue of pri­vacy with Vene­tian blinds and a row of plants out­side.</p>
    <p>The white­washed in­te­rior pro­vides a blank can­vas for the lady of the house to ex­press her cre­ativ­ity. Many of the decor and art pieces were col­lected dur­ing the fam­ily’s trips abroad.</p>
    <p>She says: “My style is eclec­tic. I do not con­strain my­self to any par­tic­u­lar style, but I en­sure that the colours of the fur­nish­ings com­ple­ment each other.</p>
    <p>“My in­put in the con­cept and ex­e­cu­tion has al­lowed me to re­alise a teenage dream of be­com­ing an ar­chi­tect or in­te­rior de­signer.”</p>
    <p>It has been just over a year since the fam­ily moved in last April and she is still dream­ing up new in­te­rior ideas. “I will re­work the look of some of the spa­ces over time. The neu­tral wall and floor­ing make this pos­si­ble.”</p>
