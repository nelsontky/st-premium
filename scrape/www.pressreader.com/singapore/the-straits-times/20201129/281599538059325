    <p>Iran has ac­cused Is­rael of as­sas­si­nat­ing one of its top nu­clear sci­en­tists.</p>
    <p>But no­body has yet claimed re­spon­si­bil­ity for Fri­day’s at­tack, in which Dr Mohsen Fakhrizade­h was gunned down by anony­mous as­sailants just out­side Te­heran, Iran’s cap­i­tal city.</p>
    <p>The sci­en­tist’s of­fi­cial des­ig­na­tion was head of the Re­search and In­no­va­tion Or­gan­i­sa­tion in the Ira­nian De­fence Min­istry.</p>
    <p>Ira­nian For­eign Min­is­ter Mo­ham­mad Javad Zarif pointed to “se­ri­ous in­di­ca­tions of Is­rael’s role” in the in­ci­dent, while Gen­eral Mo­ham­mad Bagheri, the com­man­der of Iran’s mil­i­tary, pledged to in­flict “ter­ri­ble re­venge” for the “cow­ardly at­tack”.</p>
    <p>Ira­ni­ans, he added, “will not rest un­til we have hunted down and pun­ished the per­pe­tra­tors”.</p>
    <p>The as­sas­si­na­tion of the nu­clear sci­en­tist seems likely to not only plunge the Mid­dle East into an­other bout of vi­o­lence; it also threat­ens to de­rail United States Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s plans for the re­gion well be­fore he even steps into the White House.</p>
    <p>Over the past decade, at least seven top Ira­nian nu­clear sci­en­tists are known to have been mur­dered.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary 2010, the physi­cist Mas­soud Ali-Mo­ham­madi was as­sas­si­nated in Te­heran; in Novem­ber of the same year, two other physi­cists were tar­geted in two bomb at­tacks, and the mur­ders con­tin­ued with the elim­i­na­tion of Brigadier-Gen­eral Has­san Moghad­dam, the man re­spon­si­ble for the ar­ma­ment pro­grammes of Iran’s Revo­lu­tion­ary Guards, the regime’s most loyal forces.</p>
    <p>Al­though Is­rael never ad­mit­ted re­spon­si­bil­ity, many Is­raeli of­fi­cials – and par­tic­u­larly re­tired in­tel­li­gence com­man­ders – have ad­mit­ted over the years that their coun­try has mounted such at­tacks to foil Iran’s quest to pro­duce nu­clear weapons.</p>
    <p>Still, the lat­est as­sas­si­na­tion eas­ily over­shad­ows all oth­ers. For it killed not just any nu­clear sci­en­tist, but the man widely re­garded as the fa­ther of Iran’s nu­clear race.</p>
    <p>Dr Fakhrizade­h was en­gaged in the pro­gramme since its in­cep­tion in the late 1980s and was al­ways seen as its real brain. That much was pointed out by none other than Is­raeli Prime Min­is­ter Ben­jamin Ne­tanyahu, who – while un­veil­ing a stash of seized of­fi­cial Ira­nian doc­u­ments dur­ing a press con­fer­ence in 2018 – point­edly asked his lis­ten­ers to “re­mem­ber that name, Fakhrizade­h”.</p>
    <p>Spec­u­la­tion is now rife that Dr Fakhrizade­h’s as­sas­si­na­tion was de­cided upon dur­ing the se­cret meet­ing be­tween Mr Ne­tanyahu, Saudi Crown Prince Mo­hammed bin Sal­man and US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo, which al­legedly took place early this week.</p>
    <p>But that is un­likely to be true, partly be­cause Is­raeli and US of­fi­cials do not need a for­mal meet­ing to agree on such an op­er­a­tion, but also be­cause Is­rael would not be too keen to share the sen­si­tive in­tel­li­gence in­for­ma­tion re­quired for such an at­tack with the Saudis.</p>
    <p>What is very prob­a­ble, how­ever, is that Is­rael had at least the tacit ap­proval of the cur­rent Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion for the op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>And it is cer­tain that the as­sas­si­na­tion amounts to a se­ri­ous blow to Iran, on at least two counts.</p>
    <p>Every nu­clear pro­gramme in­volves many sci­en­tists but has one key in­di­vid­ual who in­spires the oth­ers with knowl­edge and com­mit­ment. Dr Fakhrizade­h was just such an in­di­vid­ual, and his dis­ap­pear­ance will be keenly felt in Te­heran.</p>
    <p>Then there is the sheer hu­mil­i­a­tion in­flicted on the Ira­nian regime. For Dr Fakhrizade­h was known to be a high-value tar­get, and was pro­tected with elab­o­rate se­cu­rity pro­ce­dures.</p>
    <p>Yet none of this made any dif­fer­ence; Is­rael and the US knew ex­actly where he was, and had no dif­fi­culty in tak­ing him out, just as the Amer­i­cans had no dif­fi­culty killing Gen­eral Qasem Soleimani early this year – a top Ira­nian mil­i­tary com­man­der and an­other sup­pos­edly in­vis­i­ble of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>If Is­rael were be­hind Dr Fakhrizade­h’s killing, it would have sought to achieve a few strate­gic ob­jec­tives.</p>
    <p>The first would clearly be com­pli­cat­ing the task of the in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion in the US in deal­ing with Iran. Mr Bi­den and his team want to restart di­plo­matic talks with Iran, some­thing Is­rael stren­u­ously op­poses.</p>
    <p>Mr Ne­tanyahu may also be in­ter­ested in rush­ing through what­ever plans he had to hit at Iran’s nu­clear ca­pa­bil­ity be­fore Mr Bi­den is sworn in as US pres­i­dent in Jan­uary, pre­cisely be­cause he sus­pects that the new US ad­min­is­tra­tion will not ap­prove of such ac­tions.</p>
    <p>And there is the added ad­van­tage that the as­sas­si­na­tion re­minds ev­ery­one of Is­rael’s mil­i­tary and in­tel­li­gence su­pe­ri­or­ity in the re­gion, a bonus at a time when Gulf monar­chies are now nor­mal­is­ing re­la­tions with the Jewish state pre­cisely be­cause they see Is­rael as their bul­wark against Iran.</p>
    <p>Ei­ther way, the two months lead­ing to Mr Bi­den’s in­au­gu­ra­tion and move to the White House seem likely to be very event­ful in the Mid­dle East.</p>
