    <p>NEW YORK • Their ini­tial plan was to re­tire at this year’s US Open. In­stead, Bob and Mike Bryan, the most suc­cess­ful men’s dou­bles team i n the history of ten­nis, brought the cur­tain down on their 22-year pro­fes­sional ca­reers just days be­fore their home Grand Slam starts on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The twins, 42, cap­tured a pro­fes­sional era record 119 ti­tles to­gether, in­clud­ing 16 Grand Slams, 39 ATP Mas­ters 1000s and the ATP Fi­nals ti­tle four times.</p>
    <p>“We just both feel it in our guts that it is the right mo­ment,” Mike, the older of the broth­ers by two min­utes, said on Wed­nes­day. “At this age it takes so much work to go out there and com­pete.</p>
    <p>“We love play­ing still but we don’t love get­ting our bod­ies ready to get out there. We want to go out right now where we still have some good ten­nis left.”</p>
    <p>They were not on the en­try list for the US Open that was re­leased on Aug 19, prompt­ing spec­u­la­tion that they had cho­sen to re­tire.</p>
    <p>Flush­ing Mead­ows was the scene of their Grand Slam de­but in 1995, when they lost in the first round.</p>
    <p>The Cal­i­for­nian pair, fa­mous for their trade­mark chest-bump cel­e­bra­tion, went on to be­come the top-ranked dou­bles team in the world for 438 weeks.</p>
    <p>They were the first team to clinch a Ca­reer Golden Mas­ters in 2014 with their Shang­hai tri­umph. They also won Olympic gold at Lon­don 2012 and were part of the US Davis Cup-win­ning team in 2007.</p>
    <p>Mike claimed two more Grand Slam ti­tles with Jack Sock in 2018 af­ter his brother was side­lined with a hip in­jury.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, they de­cided on a farewell tour that would cul­mi­nate at the US Open. The Bryans still ex­ited on a high, hav­ing lifted the Del­ray Beach Open ti­tle in Fe­bru­ary be­fore the sea­son was halted by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“We weren’t in this last year to just play the matches and to get points or to make money,” Bob said.</p>
    <p>“It was to re­ally say our thanky­ous to ev­ery­body and feel the at­mos­phere one last time.”</p>
    <p>But there will be no fans at the US Open and an­other key player who will be ab­sent in New York is Ja­pan’s Kei Nishikori.</p>
    <p>The 30-year-old, a fi­nal­ist at Flush­ing Mead­ows in 2014, said on Wed­nes­day that he had tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive twice this month but he has de­cided to skip the hard-court Grand Slam.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter such a long break I feel that re­turn­ing in a best-of-five long-match set­ting is not smart un­til I am fully ready to do so,” the for­mer world No. 4, now ranked 31st, said.</p>
    <p>“It’s dis­ap­point­ing as I love the US Open and have great mem­o­ries there. I will start on the clay.”</p>
