    <p>• Se­nior Olympic of­fi­cial John Coates has re­it­er­ated that Tokyo must stage a sim­pli­fied Sum­mer Games next year, with the health and safety of ath­letes the most im­por­tant con­sid­er­a­tion in the plan­ning.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Coates heads the In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee’s (IOC) Co­or­di­na­tion Com­mis­sion for the Tokyo 2020 Games, which have been post­poned un­til next year be­cause of the global Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The good news is that all 42 Games’ venues have been rese­cured. The com­pe­ti­tion sched­ule is the same,” the IOC vice-pres­i­dent wrote in Syd­ney’s Daily Tele­graph yes­ter­day, a day af­ter the one-year count­down to the open­ing cer­e­mony on July 23.</p>
    <p>“But we must re­duce the cost im­pact of post­pone­ment as well as sim­plify the Games to en­sure they can be or­gan­ised ef­fi­ciently, safely and sus­tain­ably, in this new con­text.</p>
    <p>“With one year to go, there is no clear pic­ture of what shape the sim­pli­fied Games will take.</p>
    <p>“The sit­u­a­tion with Covid-19, both do­mes­ti­cally and in­ter­na­tion­ally, is con­stantly chang­ing.”</p>
    <p>Tokyo 2020 or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee pres­i­dent Yoshiro Mori said on Wed­nes­day that the de­vel­op­ment of a coro­n­avirus vac­cine or treat­ment will be key to al­low­ing the Games to open in a year’s time.</p>
    <p>Coates wrote that with­out a vac­cine, putting in place coun­ter­mea­sures against Covid-19 would be no easy task. But he wel­comed the top-level com­mit­ment from the Ja­panese gov­ern­ment, Tokyo re­gional gov­ern­ment and Games or­gan­is­ing panel to get it done.</p>
    <p>“The IOC and our Ja­panese part­ners... are do­ing ev­ery­thing in their power to en­sure that not only will the Games go ahead next year, but the ath­letes (also) re­main first and fore­most in all our plan­ning,” he added.</p>
    <p>“Yes, we want the ath­letes of the world to have their Olympic mo­ment of com­pe­ti­tion, just as they would have dreamt.</p>
    <p>“But, crit­i­cally, they must ex­pe­ri­ence that mo­ment in an en­vi­ron­ment where their health and safety is as­sured.”</p>
    <p>He is also pres­i­dent of the Aus­tralian Olympic Com­mit­tee and added that the re­ac­tion of his coun­try’s ath­letes to the post­pone­ment had been “in­spi­ra­tional”.</p>
    <p>“All ath­letes with a Tokyo dream in their hearts have had to re­cal­i­brate their plans for a Games. They have demon­strated re­mark­able re­silience in mak­ing that ad­just­ment,” he wrote.</p>
