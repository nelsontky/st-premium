    <p>From go­ing 75 days with zero in­come to be­com­ing so good at hawk­ing prod­ucts on­line that he now has seven em­ploy­ees, getai host Wang Lei may be com­ing out of the Covid-19 pan­demic bet­ter than when he en­tered it.</p>
    <p>The fast-talk­ing 59-year-old tells The Sun­day Times in a tele­phone in­ter­view in Man­darin that his suc­cess was a sur­prise.</p>
    <p>“From Fe­bru­ary, my jobs for the next three months un­til Mother’s Day were can­celled. Pro­duc­tion for Ho Seh Bo (a Chan­nel 8 di­alect drama se­ries) and one of my com­mer­cials also paused. I took out my fixed-de­posit sum be­fore its mat­u­ra­tion date be­cause I needed the money,” he says.</p>
    <p>But the free time al­lowed him to help out a fish­mon­ger friend whose business was suf­fer­ing due to mea­sures to curb the spread of Covid-19. Wang ad­mits he felt odd at first sell­ing seafood on­line.</p>
    <p>He says: “Usu­ally, peo­ple buy in the mar­kets, right? Who buys from the In­ter­net?”</p>
    <p>But his au­di­ence opened their wal­lets – he helped to sell 5,000 fishes over four live streams on Face­book. Wang and his wife took or­ders on What­sApp and stayed up af­ter the live streams to take down the de­liv­ery ad­dresses.</p>
    <p>“We spent three days with­out sleep, just copy­ing ad­dresses,” says Wang, who was so good at on­line hawk­ing that he was dubbed Fish­selling Big Brother.</p>
    <p>He then be­gan get­ting re­quests to pro­mote all sorts of prod­ucts – from seafood to cars – with sup­pli­ers pay­ing him for his ef­forts.</p>
    <p>By May, Wang – who be­gan his live-stream ca­reer from the mod­est­look­ing kitchen in his flat – was an In­ter­net sen­sa­tion. With new fans from China, Tai­wan and South-east Asia, he now has a ded­i­cated or­der site and can get more than a mil­lion views on some of his live-stream videos.</p>
    <p>Wang says he gets about 100 re­quests a week from sup­pli­ers look­ing to sell their goods.</p>
    <p>Business is so good that his 33-year-old son quit his job as a sales­man to man­age his fa­ther’s op­er­a­tions full-time. Wang, who also has two daugh­ters, has em­ployed seven peo­ple and rented a ware­house from which to stage his live-stream videos.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, he sold 6,000 boxes of Mao Shan Wang duri­ans to Chi­nese buy­ers on Chi­nese live-stream plat­form Inke in an hour. He also teamed up with lo­cal di­rec­tor Jack Neo to sell seven cars from dealer CarTimes Au­to­mo­bile on­line, in 11/2 hours.</p>
    <p>On his ap­peal, Wang – who livestream­s in a mix of Hokkien and Man­darin – says: “Maybe sup­pli­ers think I have grass­roots charm and seem down to earth be­cause I use so much di­alect.”</p>
    <p>Many fans are drawn to Fish­selling Big Brother’s rants, jokes and ex­ple­tives, some­times even di­rected at the au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>He ex­plains: “This per­sona wasn’t some­thing in­ten­tional be­cause when I was live-stream­ing, some were ask­ing de­lib­er­ately stupid ques­tions and mak­ing jokes.</p>
    <p>“I was an­noyed that they were in­ter­rupt­ing and dis­tract­ing me, so I scolded them. But as it turns out, the more I scold them, the more they like it.”</p>
    <p>While he is more used to per­form­ing in phys­i­cal venues, he says the In­ter­net has a reach that is un­par­al­leled.</p>
    <p>“On getais, you can’t see com­ments live, but on live stream, you can. And on live stream, there can be 60,000 peo­ple watch­ing me live. That’s six Sin­ga­pore In­door Sta­dium-sized crowds watch­ing me.</p>
    <p>“I’m thank­ful to Face­book for giv­ing j ob­less un­cles like me a plat­form to do some­thing new.”</p>
    <p>But his suc­cess is not with­out stum­bles. “One time, I was livestream­ing on a Chi­nese plat­form and my stream got cut off and ter­mi­nated abruptly. I later learnt that it was be­cause I men­tioned China and Tai­wan. It’s very sen­si­tive, so the stream got cut off im­me­di­ately,” he says.</p>
    <p>He also had to post an apology on Wednesday af­ter Tai­wanese au­di­ences of his live stream got into a com­ment war over the is­land’s pol­i­tics and he tried to ease the ten­sion with jokes, which an­gered even more peo­ple.</p>
    <p>He says he hopes his view­ers can keep away from dis­cussing for­eign po­lit­i­cal top­ics on his live stream.</p>
    <p>Still, he is go­ing strong. He em­barked on a nine-day, livestream tour in Malaysia on Thurs­day to work in per­son with var­i­ous sup­pli­ers. There are plans as well for a live-stream tour in Tai­wan and China, and Neo plans to make a movie about his life.</p>
    <p>When asked how much he earns from his live-stream gigs, Wang says: “No, no, no. I will not dis­close. But no mat­ter how much I earn, I will take out 30 per cent to do­nate, buy­ing food for low-in­come fam­i­lies. I’ve been do­ing this for the past five months.”</p>
    <p>As for how long he thinks his new­found ca­reer will last, he does not know.</p>
    <p>“I won’t say I’m a suc­cess. Ev­ery­thing is so un­pre­dictable right now. But I hope I can i nspire some peo­ple be­cause I was the same. I lost my in­come, but I changed and adapted and I sur­vived.”</p>
    <p>This per­sona wasn’t some­thing in­ten­tional be­cause when I was live-stream­ing, some were ask­ing de­lib­er­ately stupid ques­tions and mak­ing jokes. I was an­noyed that they were in­ter­rupt­ing and dis­tract­ing me, so I scolded them.</p>
    <p>But as it turns out, the more I scold them, the more they like it.</p>
