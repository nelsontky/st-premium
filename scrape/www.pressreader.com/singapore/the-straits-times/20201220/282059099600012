    <p>On Christ­mas morn­ing, a hus­band qui­etly apol­o­gises to his wife that his gifts this year are hum­ble – money is tight. She bravely af­firms that she loves the py­ja­mas and sweater. Later, as the chil­dren play with their new toys, the hus­band re­veals one last gift box, in which the wife dis­cov­ers a di­a­mond neck­lace. She squeals with as­ton­ished de­light.</p>
    <p>This ad­ver­tis­ing trope is not just cloy­ing. It also feeds five false be­liefs peo­ple com­monly hold about what makes gift re­cip­i­ents happy.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, psy­cho­log­i­cal and mar­ket­ing re­search not only shows that th­ese be­liefs are wrong; it also of­fers guid­ance for pick­ing gifts peo­ple will ac­tu­ally like.</p>
    <p>First, ig­nore price. De­spite the stock phrase, “It’s the thought that counts”, gift givers think that spend­ing a lot – on di­a­monds, for ex­am­ple – shows that they care.</p>
    <p>When re­searchers asked peo­ple to re­call a gift they gave and then to rate how much they thought re­cip­i­ents liked it, higher prices went with higher rat­ings. But when peo­ple made the same rat­ings for a gift they had re­ceived, price was com­pletely un­re­lated to en­joy­ment.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, give gifts that are ac­tu­ally usable. Gift givers tend to fo­cus on how plea­sur­able it would be to use the gift, but over­look how eas­ily or of­ten the gift will be used; a hus­band might imag­ine his wife feel­ing like a mil­lion bucks in her di­a­monds, but ig­nore the fact that she sel­dom wears for­mal jew­ellery.</p>
    <p>In an ex­per­i­ment show­ing this phe­nom­e­non, re­searchers ap­proached peo­ple in pairs who were out in public. One per­son (10 feet, or 3m, away from the other) com­pleted a word search puz­zle and was told that, as a re­ward, she could give her friend one of two gifts: a pen de­scribed as beau­ti­ful but too heavy for ev­ery­day use, or a re­tractable pen that was easy to carry.</p>
    <p>Gift givers favoured the beau­ti­ful pen but re­cip­i­ents were not only hap­pier if they got the prac­ti­cal pen, they rated it as the more thought­ful gift.</p>
    <p>Givers might favour the beau­ti­ful and dra­matic be­cause they think about gifts in the ab­stract: “What’s a good gift?” Re­cip­i­ents, in con­trast, imag­ine them­selves us­ing it, and so fo­cus more on util­ity.</p>
    <p>That’s why peo­ple buy­ing gift cards for oth­ers of­ten pre­fer lux­ury brands over ev­ery­day brands, but the pref­er­ence re­verses when they are buy­ing for them­selves.</p>
    <p>In­deed, a study ex­am­ined the prices that resold gift cards com­manded on eBay, and showed that peo­ple were will­ing to pay around US$77 (S$102) for a</p>
    <p>US$100 gift card to a more ex­pen­sive store, but would pay around US$89 for a US$100 gift card to an ev­ery­day es­tab­lish­ment.</p>
    <p>Third (and this one is es­pe­cially rel­e­vant dur­ing the pan­demic), don’t worry if your gift isn’t usable im­me­di­ately. Al­though it feels odd to you, re­cip­i­ents don’t mind wait­ing. In one ex­per­i­ment, re­searchers asked peo­ple to com­pare dif­fer­ent types of gifts: one was im­me­di­ately ap­peal­ing, such as a dozen flow­ers in full bloom, or, for a sim­i­lar price, a gift that would be more sat­is­fy­ing in the long term, such as two dozen buds that would bloom in a few days.</p>
    <p>When peo­ple thought they would give the gift, they pre­ferred the for­mer, but oth­ers who were asked which they’d like to re­ceive picked the lat­ter.</p>
    <p>An­other study showed a sim­i­lar asym­me­try for giv­ing part of a gift. Givers didn’t like the idea of giv­ing some­one half the money to buy a high-end blender, pre­fer­ring to give a medium-priced model out­right. Re­cip­i­ents showed the op­po­site pref­er­ence.</p>
    <p>Fourth, give peo­ple what they ask for. Gift givers think that un­ex­pect­ed­ness adds value be­cause it shows thought­ful­ness; the wife wasn’t ex­pect­ing di­a­monds, but the hus­band knew she’d love them.</p>
    <p>But re­cip­i­ents ac­tu­ally think it’s more thought­ful to give a gift that they re­quested. They see it as show­ing that the giver at­tended to and hon­oured their wishes. If some­one wants to be sur­prised, she can al­ways tell you.</p>
    <p>Fifth, give ex­pe­ri­ences, not things. That’s true even dur­ing the pan­demic – re­mem­ber, peo­ple don’t mind wait­ing. Re­search over the last decade shows that ex­pe­ri­ences lead to more long-last­ing sat­is­fac­tion than new pos­ses­sions: A fam­ily va­ca­tion is a bet­ter bet than that di­a­mond neck­lace.</p>
    <p>But givers are leery of ex­pe­ri­ences be­cause they worry it’s more likely they’ll pick some­thing the re­cip­i­ent doesn’t want. It’s a valid con­cern, but there’s an easy fix: Make sure there are choices. In­stead of giv­ing a mas­sage, give a gift cer­tifi­cate to a spa that of­fers a range of ser­vices.</p>
    <p>To be clear, all of this re­search does not show that re­cip­i­ents mostly hate the gifts they get. But it does show that, on aver­age, peo­ple could give bet­ter gifts.</p>
    <p>Why don’t they? It may be that we don’t learn what makes a good gift be­cause we sel­dom get valid feed­back; social con­ven­tion dic­tates that you must pro­fess to like any present you get.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Jeff Galak of Carnegie Mel­lon Univer­sity, along with two col­leagues, of­fers a com­pelling, some­what darker al­ter­na­tive: Givers are ac­tu­ally a bit self­ish. They favour dra­matic, ex­pen­sive, sur­pris­ing gifts be­cause they want to see the re­cip­i­ent’s de­light. The long-term plea­sure of the re­cip­i­ent may not be ob­served and there­fore is dis­counted.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a hard year, we may be es­pe­cially ea­ger to savour a look of shocked joy on a re­cip­i­ent’s face. But af­ter all, it is the sea­son to set aside our own de­sires and try our best to an­tic­i­pate theirs. That may bring longer last­ing joy.</p>
