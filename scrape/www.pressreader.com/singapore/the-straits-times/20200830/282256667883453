    <p>For the first 12 days of the cir­cuit breaker, Ms Sofia Ab­dol­lah, 31, could not leave her mas­ter bed­room.</p>
    <p>Her young chil­dren wailed out­side, frus­trated that Mummy was so close yet so far away, but she had no choice. She was un­der quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>The se­nior ed­u­ca­tional ther­a­pist with the Dys­lexia As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (DAS), a so­cial en­ter­prise, was shocked when a col­league tested pos­i­tive. As they had been in close con­tact, she was told to iso­late her­self from April 7 to 18.</p>
    <p>She used the mas­ter bed­room in her four-room flat in the north-east be­cause it had an ad­join­ing toi­let, and had to take her tem­per­a­ture thrice a day dur­ing video calls with Health Min­istry of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>In their liv­ing room, hus­band Juandy Sam­suri, 38, an oper­a­tions man­ager, set up a tent where he slept with their kids, El­ham, 51/ 2, and Harel, then al­most two.</p>
    <p>“The kids wanted to barge in. They would knock on the door and my hus­band would have to ex­plain to them. I was also on the video call telling them, ‘Mummy can­not go out be­cause Mummy could be sick.’ It took a lot of paci­fy­ing and en­cour­age­ment,” she re­mem­bers of the or­deal.</p>
    <p>As the family and their helper counted down the days to her al­lclear, sub­sist­ing on tingkat meals as they did not want to ven­ture out, Ms Sofia found her­self di­rect­ing her el­der son El­ham’s K2 home­based learn­ing via video calls, while her sup­port­ive hus­band ex­e­cuted her in­struc­tions.</p>
    <p>She also ap­pre­ci­ated the ef­forts of her peers in the in­dus­try, as her son’s teach­ers called ev­ery day to check on his health and well­be­ing.</p>
    <p>Af­ter her “me time” dur­ing quar­an­tine, she strug­gled with work­ing from home as her kids, es­pe­cially tod­dler Harel, would dis­rupt meet­ings. She re­calls an in­ci­dent dur­ing a par­ent-teacher ses­sion when he in­ter­rupted and de­manded milk.</p>
    <p>Piv­ot­ing to fully dig­i­tal learn­ing had its chal­lenges, too. Ms Sofia teaches the Main Lit­er­acy Pro­gramme for pri­mary and se­condary school stu­dents and found that maths lessons were par­tic­u­larly tricky.</p>
    <p>Un­able to use ma­nip­u­la­tives to</p>
