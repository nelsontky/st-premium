    <p>BEI­JING • Eight years af­ter be­ing given a No­bel prize in lit­er­a­ture, Mo Yan (right) re­turned with his lat­est book, A Late Bloomer, late last month.</p>
    <p>The cel­e­brated Chi­nese writer said he has never stopped writ­ing even though 10 years have passed since he pub­lished his pre­vi­ous book.</p>
    <p>In a re­cent in­ter­view with Xinhua, Mo, 65, said he hoped to be cre­ative in his writ­ing.</p>
    <p>He said writ­ers usu­ally win the No­bel Prize late in life and cre­ativ­ity of­ten ebbs with age.</p>
    <p>He pointed out that the grow­ing num­ber of so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties and en­gage­ments, as well as the pres­sure that comes along with the prize, can af­fect writ­ing.</p>
    <p>He was awarded the No­bel Prize in Lit­er­a­ture in 2012, be­com­ing the first Chi­nese cit­i­zen to win the award.</p>
    <p>He is known for nov­els such as Red Sorghum (1986), which was made into a 1987 movie by ac­claimed di­rec­tor Zhang Yi­mou and star­ring Gong Li; Big Breasts And Wide Hip (1996); and Frog (2009).</p>
    <p>Mo noted that many im­por­tant works have been cre­ated af­ter a writer is awarded the ti­tle of No­bel lau­re­ate.</p>
    <p>“I have never stopped writ­ing or pre­par­ing for a new cre­ation over the past eight years,” he said.</p>
    <p>Us­ing first-per­son nar­ra­tion, he writes “him­self” into his new book, which con­sists of 12 sto­ries.</p>
    <p>“These sto­ries con­tinue my writ­ing style, yet blend new el­e­ments,” he said.</p>
    <p>Such a way of writ­ing gives read­ers a sense of re­al­ity which, Mo said, is some­thing he pur­sues.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he added, most of the sto­ries and fig­ures in the book are fic­tional.</p>
    <p>In his eyes, the “late bloomer” in his new book is a com­pli­men­tary term de­scrib­ing peo­ple who con­ceal their tal­ent at a young age, but shine in the lat­ter half of their lives.</p>
    <p>From the per­spec­tive of lit­er­a­ture and arts, Mo said a writer or an artist who be­comes ma­ture or un­changed at an early age presages an end of cre­ation, while be­ing a late bloomer means hav­ing a spirit that al­ways pur­sues in­no­va­tion and trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>“We al­ways want changes in our works. We want to be able to sur­pass our­selves and we want to main­tain our vi­tal­ity of art and abil­ity to cre­ate,” he said.</p>
