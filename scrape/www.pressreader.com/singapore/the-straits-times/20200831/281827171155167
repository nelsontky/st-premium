    <p>SRINAGAR • In­dian forces opened fire with shot­gun pel­lets and tear gas on a pro­ces­sion by hun­dreds of Mus­lims in trou­bled Kash­mir, in­jur­ing dozens of peo­ple who had ig­nored a ban on re­li­gious gath­er­ings, wit­nesses said.</p>
    <p>The In­dian au­thor­i­ties had reim­posed the ban last Thurs­day af­ter clashes with Shi’ite Mus­lims want­ing to stage tra­di­tional pro­ces­sions for the Muhar­ram holy month.</p>
    <p>Mr Ja­far Ali, a wit­ness, said that the pro­ces­sion on Saturday started in the Bem­ina area on the out­skirts of the main city of Srinagar and that govern­ment forces were present in heavy num­bers.</p>
    <p>Mr Ali and other peo­ple who saw the clashes said se­cu­rity forces fired pel­lets and tear gas to break up the gath­er­ing.</p>
    <p>“The forces fired pel­lets at the pro­ces­sion that was mainly peace­ful and in­cluded women,” said an­other wit­ness, Mr Iqbal Ah­mad.</p>
    <p>At least 40 peo­ple were in­jured, ac­cord­ing to wit­nesses.</p>
    <p>About 25 peo­ple were taken to a nearby clinic with pel­let wounds, some with their faces and bod­ies cov­ered in pel­let marks, a doc­tor there said on con­di­tion of anonymity.</p>
    <p>“We moved about a dozen peo­ple to other fa­cil­i­ties for more ad­vanced treat­ment,” the doc­tor said.</p>
    <p>A po­lice of­fi­cial con­firmed the in­ci­dent, say­ing: “Some peo­ple had gath­ered and were try­ing to start a pro­ces­sion; they were dis­persed.”</p>
    <p>He did not give de­tails of ca­su­al­ties.</p>
    <p>Muhar­ram pro­ces­sions, to mourn Imam Hus­sain – a grand­son of Prophet Muham­mad, killed in a bat­tle about 1,400 years ago – are held around the world but have been reg­u­larly banned in In­dian Kash­mir since an up­ris­ing erupted in 1989.</p>
    <p>Mus­lims in the pro­ces­sion chanted pro-sep­a­ratist and anti-In­dian slo­gans, other wit­nesses said.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral ar­rests have been made last week of peo­ple shout­ing against In­dian rule when pro­ces­sions have been at­tempted, a po­lice of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>Some have been charged un­der anti-ter­ror­ism laws.</p>
    <p>Dozens of Shi’ite Mus­lim mourn­ers were de­tained in Srinagar on Friday af­ter they tried to start Muhar­ram pro­ces­sions.</p>
    <p>The Mus­lim-majority Hi­malayan re­gion is largely di­vided be­tween In­dia and Pak­istan, which both claim it in its en­tirety and have fought two wars over it.</p>
    <p>Last year, In­dia took away the semi-au­ton­o­mous sta­tus granted to its side of the ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>Jammu and Kash­mir state was de­moted to a union ter­ri­tory gov­erned di­rectly from New Delhi, while the Ladakh re­gion was carved out into a sep­a­rate ad­min­is­tra­tive area.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions have risen since.</p>
