    <p>THE DIAM DIAM ERA (PG13, 107 min­utes, opens to­day)</p>
    <p>The first two films in the se­ries came out in 2016 as Long Long Time Ago parts 1 and 2. Di­rec­tor Jack Neo took nostal­gia porn to a cin­e­matic level. That rose-tinted view of 1960s kam­pung life was a hit.</p>
    <p>Four years later comes this work, also split into two parts, with the next in­stal­ment ar­riv­ing at Chi­nese New Year.</p>
    <p>What is new is that the Lim chil­dren are now liv­ing in a Hous­ing Board flat, with un­cle Ah Kun (Mark Lee) check­ing in on them.</p>
    <p>Neo’s fo­cus has also shifted from fam­ily melo­drama to pol­i­tics – in par­tic­u­lar the per­ceived era­sure of Chi­nese-ness through the English-first ed­u­ca­tion pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Go­ing into de­tail here is tricky be­cause the film’s story will con­clude only next year, but the con­flict is seen mostly through the eyes of the Lim clan’s younger mem­bers, who are ei­ther side­lined – as in the case of the na­tional ser­vice­man Shun Fa (Richie Koh) – or made a laugh­ing stock be­cause of their lack of English pro­fi­ciency.</p>
    <p>This com­edy-drama dares open cul­tural wounds many thought had healed. Other is­sues are looked at too. There are bits in which cabby Ah Kun ar­gues with of­fi­cials over park­ing and re­stricted zone coupon vi­o­la­tions, but these are dis­tract­ing time fillers (as are the mon­tages set to hit di­alect and Man­darin songs of the pe­riod).</p>
    <p>With much of the time taken up by Ah Kun’s run-ins with the au­thor­i­ties and Shun Fa’s na­tional ser­vice tra­vails, what is no­tice­ably ab­sent are sto­ries for the three Lim women (played by Meixin Macy, Yap Hui Xin and Regina Lim) or in­deed any woman.</p>
    <p>For­mer K-pop singer Tasha Low makes a brief ap­pear­ance as Shun Fa’s folk-singer love in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>There are the usual tir­ing Neo-isms, mostly to do with his view that the prob­lems af­fect­ing a group of Chi­nese men should be ev­ery­one’s prob­lem but with­out ex­plain­ing why. It makes him re­luc­tant to trim bits with over­long male ban­ter and causes him to di­vide women into ei­ther sim­per­ing cuties or the com­i­cally over­weight.</p>
    <p>Ah Kun comes across not as a real per­son but as a tool for ex­press­ing dis­gruntle­ment with any­thing in­vented af­ter 1971. It shows that even when Neo is tak­ing the high road by tack­ling is­sues, one can al­ways count on him to un­der­cut him­self.</p>
    <p>THE CROODS: A NEW AGE (PG, 90 min­utes, opens to­day)</p>
    <p>Old meets new when the Croods run into the Bet­ter­mans, a fam­ily liv­ing the sweet life be­hind walls that keep in food while keep­ing out dan­ger­ous beast­ies.</p>
    <p>The Bet­ter­mans (voiced by Peter Din­klage, Les­lie Mann and Kelly Marie Tran) wel­come the Croods into their high-tech utopia, but can­not help see­ing them­selves as more evolved and there­fore su­pe­rior to the cave-lov­ing Croods (Ni­co­las Cage, Emma Stone, Cather­ine Keener, Cloris Leach­man, Clark Duke; Ryan Reynolds voices the out­sider, Guy).</p>
    <p>The snobs-ver­sus-slobs set-up in this fol­low-up to 2013’s The</p>
    <p>Croods will end as all such set-ups do. It is the get­ting there that counts.</p>
    <p>Here, the jour­ney is paved with quips of the tele­vi­sion sit­com va­ri­ety, ones that make re­lat­able ref­er­ences to the world to­day. There is an ex­tended sight gag, for ex­am­ple, about a Bet­ter­man in­ven­tion called a “win­dow” that has en­tranced Thunk (Duke), who be­comes glued to it as one would to a tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>The film buzzes with vis­ual en­ergy – the plants are a Pan­dora’s box of sur­prises and the hy­brid an­i­mals are in­spired – but that rich eye candy only makes the played-out na­ture of the jokes more ap­par­ent.</p>
    <p>First-time fea­ture di­rec­tor Joel Craw­ford cut his teeth as an artist on an­i­ma­tion that leans heav­ily on com­edy (Bee Movie, 2007; all three Kung Fu Panda movies,</p>
    <p>2008 to 2016) at the ex­pense of char­ac­ter or plot. But the gags, while trite, are at least com­pe­tently ex­e­cuted.</p>
    <p>FALL­ING (R21, 113 min­utes, opens to­day)</p>
    <p>Viggo Mortensen likes to keep busy. When not star­ring in films, run­ning a pub­lish­ing house or writ­ing po­etry, he is mak­ing mu­sic, paint­ing or tak­ing photograph­s.</p>
    <p>With this fam­ily drama, the 62-year-old Dan­ish-Amer­i­can ac­tor adds screen­writer, di­rec­tor and sound­track mu­si­cian to his re­sume. Luck­ily, the work bears no trace of a man who has spread him­self thinly – the emo­tions are heart­felt and range from sweet to scary.</p>
    <p>Lance Hen­rik­sen, the</p>
    <p>80-year-old ac­tor who broke through as the an­droid Bishop in the science-fic­tion thriller Aliens (1986), is ter­ri­fy­ing as Wil­lis, a farmer stricken with de­men­tia. His son John (Mortensen) has taken him into the home he shares with hus­band Eric (Terry Chen) and daugh­ter Mon­ica (Gabby Velis).</p>
    <p>The stage is set for con­fronta­tion. Father and son have dif­fer­ent views about what “nor­mal” sex­u­al­ity is, but there are other gulfs, made worse by the older man’s loos­en­ing grasp on re­al­ity. Wil­lis ex­presses toxic opin­ions so of­ten, that ev­ery time he speaks, ev­ery­one in John’s lib­eral Cal­i­for­nia home clenches, as would many in the au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>John and his sis­ter Sarah (Laura Lin­ney) have a duty of care, but liv­ing with the man who is a re­minder of their cold, empty child­hoods could give them break­downs as well as cre­ate rifts in the fam­i­lies they have now.</p>
    <p>Mortensen has cre­ated a mem­o­rable vil­lain in Wil­lis, a de­pen­dant re­ly­ing on the peo­ple to whom he showed an es­pe­cially tough brand of love. His chil­dren are do­ing what they can with their blus­tery father, a man who would be easy to hate if not for Hen­rik­sen giv­ing glimpses of the fright­ened, frag­ile man be­neath.</p>
    <p>THE CURSED LES­SON (R21, 93 min­utes, opens to­day, not re­viewed)</p>
    <p>It is body hor­ror time in this South Korean film that ex­plores the cut-throat world of beauty in­flu­encers.</p>
    <p>When model Hyo-jung (Lee Chae-young) faces ir­rel­e­vancy among new com­pe­ti­tion, she tries ev­ery so­lu­tion science has to of­fer. Then hope ar­rives in the form of a mys­te­ri­ous yoga class that prom­ises amaz­ing re­sults, which come with a hideous price tag.</p>
