    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong has cau­tioned that while Sin­ga­pore’s Covid-19 num­bers are very low, with al­most no com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion in the past few days, the bat­tle is not over.</p>
    <p>“All you need is one su­per spreader, and we will be chas­ing our tails again,” he said at the Apec CEO Di­a­logues yesterday.</p>
    <p>What Sin­ga­pore has to do is keep up its pre­cau­tions, and build up its test­ing and con­tact trac­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties, and then it will be able to open up cau­tiously, he added.</p>
    <p>About Asia be­ing more con­ser­va­tive than the West in tack­ling Covid-19, he was quick to say that things can go wrong very quickly.</p>
    <p>The at­ti­tude Sin­ga­pore has taken is not to let the dis­ease burn through the pop­u­la­tion, said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>“I would come down on the side of mak­ing sure that peo­ple are safe and healthy, and well treated med­i­cally. Hav­ing se­cured that, I make sure that I look af­ter my econ­omy.”</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment is work­ing very hard to pre­vent a sec­ond out­break or even a sec­ond cir­cuit breaker, which would have a big im­pact on the psy­chol­ogy of the pop­u­la­tion, he added.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple will be dis­cour­aged, maybe de­mor­alised, cer­tainly will be angsty and frac­tious. It is not easy to main­tain sol­i­dar­ity in the face of a threat, which keeps on be­ing there, going away and com­ing back again, going away and com­ing back again.</p>
    <p>“We are try­ing our best to avoid that roller-coaster.” Grace Ho</p>
