    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong for­mally kicked off a two-week reg­is­tra­tion pe­riod for can­di­dates to run in a key leg­isla­tive elec­tion in Septem­ber, amid fears that the au­thor­i­ties might try to dis­qual­ify an as­sertive young gen­er­a­tion of democrats.</p>
    <p>The ci­ty­wide poll will be a cru­cial bat­tle­ground for the city’s demo­cratic op­po­si­tion to try to re­claim some po­lit­i­cal i nflu­ence i n the wake of tough na­tional security laws China im­posed on June 30.</p>
    <p>These laws have been de­cried by crit­ics, in­clud­ing the United States, as a death knell for the city’s free­doms and au­ton­omy from China.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese and Hong Kong of­fi­cials, how­ever, say the laws will bring sta­bil­ity to the fi­nan­cial hub af­ter a restive year and af­fect only a very small mi­nor­ity of “trou­ble­mak­ers”.</p>
    <p>A van­guard of young democrats are rar­ing to get on the bal­lot, hav­ing stormed to big wins in an un­offi</p>
    <p>China im­poses re­tal­ia­tory sanc­tions on four US politi­cians, in­clud­ing three Re­pub­li­can con­gress­men who are vo­cal crit­ics of the al­leged hu­man rights abuses in Xin­jiang, for in­ter­fer­ing in its in­ter­nal af­fairs.</p>
    <p>TUES­DAY, JULY 14</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump scraps Hong Kong’s spe­cial sta­tus un­der US law and signs into law the Hong Kong Au­ton­omy Act that will pun­ish Chi­nese of­fi­cials re­spon­si­ble for the city’s na­tional security law.</p>
    <p>The US also be­gins the sus­pen­sion of its ex­tra­di­tion agree­ment with Hong Kong. China vows sanc­tions on Amer­i­can in­di­vid­u­als and cial “pri­mary” elec­tion this month.</p>
    <p>These young fire­brands, or “lo­cal­ists”, who of­ten em­brace a more con­fronta­tional anti-China stance, have ap­pealed more broadly to younger, dis­af­fected vot­ers who no longer be­lieve the mod­er­ate rhetoric of vet­eran democrats.</p>
    <p>“For ev­ery can­di­date in the prodemoc­racy camp, we must unify at this time, to avoid at­tack­ing our­selves and to con­sol­i­date our strength to chal­lenge the tyranny,” Mr Sam Che­ung, a young demo­cratic hope­ful, said on Face­book.</p>
    <p>But over­shad­ow­ing their prospects is the risk of dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>In the past four years, the au­thor­i­ties have barred 18 democrats, in­clud­ing prom­i­nent ac­tivist Joshua Wong, from run­ning in lo­cal elec­tions, ac­cord­ing to a re­port by rights group Civil Rights Observer.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics say the dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tions – on grounds in­clud­ing a dis­sent­ing ide­ol­ogy or sup­port for Hong Kong in­de­pen­dence – are meant to curb the as­cen­dancy of this new crop of democrats.</p>
    <p>At least six young can­di­dates were barred from the pre­vi­ous leg­isla­tive poll in 2016, in­clud­ing pro-in­de­pen­dence leader Ed­ward Le­ung, who has since been jailed on a ri­ot­ing charge.</p>
    <p>Given the height­ened po­lit­i­cal ten­sions af­ter last year’s of­ten vi­o­lent anti-gov­ern­ment protests, mass dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tions of can­di­dates could stoke fresh so­cial un­rest, though re­place­ment can­di­dates are also poised to jump in if need be.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong re­turned from Bri­tish to Chi­nese rule in 1997 with the prom­ise of a high de­gree of au­ton­omy and broad free­doms in­clud­ing “the right to stand for and take part” in elec­tions.</p>
    <p>The im­po­si­tion of the na­tional security law, how­ever, grants China wide-rang­ing new pow­ers to clamp down on civil so­ci­ety and dis­sent­ing voices in the city, and to over-ride lo­cal laws to take ju­ris­dic­tion over cer­tain big and com­plex cases.</p>
    <p>Should the democrats make his­tory and seize 35 seats or more in the 70-seat Cham­ber for the first time, they could stymie the city’s an­nual bud­get and deepen over­sight of gov­ern­ment pol­icy.</p>
    <p>“For me, tak­ing part in this elec­tion is es­sen­tially to re­sist,” said lo­cal­ist Ven­tus Lau.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new security leg­is­la­tion, all can­di­dates for lo­cal elec­tions must swear al­le­giance to Hong Kong and pledge to up­hold Hong Kong’s mini-Con­sti­tu­tion, the Ba­sic Law. Some have re­fused to make such a pledge, though oth­ers say it is more im­por­tant to get on the bal­lot.</p>
    <p>Around 4.47 mil­lion of Hong Kong’s 7.5 mil­lion res­i­dents are el­i­gi­ble to vote on Sept 6. en­ti­ties in re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain an­nounces it will ban Chi­nese tech gi­ant Huawei’s equip­ment from its 5G net­works, re­vers­ing its ini­tial de­ci­sion amid Amer­i­can lob­by­ing for Euro­pean coun­tries to ex­clude Huawei from their 5G net­works due to po­ten­tial security con­cerns.</p>
    <p>China slams the de­ci­sion as dis­ap­point­ing.</p>
    <p>It an­nounces sanc­tions on Amer­i­can aero­space and de­fence man­u­fac­turer Lock­heed Martin over Washington’s re­cent ap­proval of weapon sales to Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump says he is not in­ter­ested in trade talks with Bei­jing on phase two of their trade deal be­cause of its han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, in an in­ter­view with CBS News.</p>
    <p>WED­NES­DAY, JULY 15</p>
    <p>The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal re­port that the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion is in early dis­cus­sions over a travel ban on Com­mu­nist Party of China mem­bers and their fam­i­lies. The pro­posed travel ban, if green-lit, could block more than 90 mil­lion Chi­nese na­tion­als from en­ter­ing the US.</p>
    <p>THURS­DAY, JULY 16</p>
    <p>At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Wil­liam Barr in a speech slams Dis­ney, Hol­ly­wood and other Amer­i­can cor­po­ra­tions for “kow­tow­ing” to China, ac­cus­ing them of cen­sor­ing them­selves on is­sues sen­si­tive to Bei­jing in ex­change for short-term profits.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can com­pa­nies will learn the cost of com­pro­mise, he says, point­ing to how copy­cat theme parks sprung up in China af­ter Dis­ney opened its park in Shanghai.</p>
    <p>FRI­DAY, JULY 17</p>
    <p>The US sanc­tions four Chi­nese na­tion­als and one com­pany for their roles in traf­fick­ing fen­tanyl, a drug that has played a ma­jor role in Amer­ica’s opi­oid cri­sis.</p>
