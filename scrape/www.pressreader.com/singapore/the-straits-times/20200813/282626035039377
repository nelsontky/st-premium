    <p>TOKYO The mu­sic grows grad­u­ally. First a snare drum-like beat, then a throaty drone lay­ered on top, fol­lowed by high-pitched hum­ming. And then the monk be­gins to chant the heart su­tra.</p>
    <p>The unique mu­si­cal ex­pe­ri­ence is the work of Yo­getsu Akasaka, a Ja­panese mu­si­cian and for­mally-trained Bud­dhist monk who has be­come a vi­ral phe­nom­e­non with tracks mar­ry­ing re­li­gious chant­ing with beat­box­ing.</p>
    <p>His Heart Su­tra Loop­ing Remix, fea­tur­ing the 37-year-old dressed in the for­mal robes worn by Bud­dhist monks at fu­ner­als, has been viewed on YouTube more than 980,000 times since it was posted in May.</p>
    <p>The seven-minute video was filmed in a stu­dio and shows Akasaka lay­er­ing sounds via a beat­box de­vice called a Loop­sta­tion and then chant­ing the re­li­gious text on top.</p>
    <p>The idea came to him dur­ing the state of emer­gency i mposed i n Ja­pan over the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, when both his work as a mu­si­cian and a monk over­see­ing funeral and memo­rial ser­vices dried up.</p>
    <p>“It was all can­celled. So I had no job, I had no in­come. And to me, it was re­ally a pain, but at the same time, I thought it was a re­ally good op­por­tu­nity to think about my­self or to think about the fu­ture of Bud­dhism,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I was try­ing to find my own way to de­liver Bud­dhist teach­ings to peo­ple not only in Ja­pan, but also all over the world.”</p>
    <p>CHANG­ING VIEWS</p>
    <p>Akasaka has long been in­ter­ested both in mu­sic and re­li­gion.</p>
    <p>He be­gan beat­box­ing around 15 years ago, buy­ing a loop­ing ma­chine in 2009 to help him build lay­ered sounds. Dur­ing years spent in the United States and Aus­tralia, he oc­ca­sion­ally busked to make money.</p>
    <p>He came to re­li­gion a lit­tle later, ini­tially re­ject­ing sug­ges­tions from his fa­ther – who be­came a Bud­dhist monk in his 50s, when Akasaka was in high school.</p>
    <p>“In Ja­pan, it’s very com­mon that the son of a priest suc­ceeds their fa­ther... And so my fa­ther some­times asked me if I wanted to be­come a monk and suc­ceed him. And</p>
    <p>I would say no, I was not in­ter­ested in it,” he said.</p>
    <p>But af­ter he turned 30, Akasaka be­gan to re­con­sider as he thought more about the mean­ing of life and death, and he even­tu­ally spent a lit­tle over two years train­ing to be a monk.</p>
    <p>In Ja­pan, it is not un­com­mon for monks to ful­fil re­li­gious du­ties and main­tain a non-re­li­gious ca­reer, like Akasaka’s work as a mu­si­cian.</p>
    <p>Re­cently he has or­gan­ised live stream­ing ses­sions of his mu­sic, so­lic­it­ing do­na­tions to help see him through the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But he also hopes that by com­bin­ing his two pas­sions, he can of­fer a fresh per­spec­tive on Bud­dhism to younger peo­ple, par­tic­u­larly in Ja­pan, where he says the re­li­gion is largely as­so­ci­ated with death and funeral rites.</p>
    <p>“Most of them be­lieve Bud­dhism is some­thing for a per­son who died al­ready. But it’s ac­tu­ally not,” he said. “So maybe, if my mu­sic at­tracts younger peo­ple, it will be a good op­por­tu­nity for them to know about Bud­dhism.”</p>
