    <p>TRIPOLI • Nearly 100 peo­ple drowned on Thurs­day when two ves­sels car­ry­ing mi­grants sank off the coast of Libya in sep­a­rate in­ci­dents that are the lat­est in a se­ries of dis­as­ters in the world’s dead­li­est sea cross­ing.</p>
    <p>In the first in­ci­dent in which at least 74 died, a mo­torised rub­ber raft, crowded with more than 120 peo­ple, had left Khoms, Libya, on Wed­nes­day, ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Mi­gra­tion (IOM).</p>
    <p>But the craft, which was ill equipped for the jour­ney across the Mediter­ranean Sea, cap­sized on Thurs­day, it said.</p>
    <p>Fish­er­men and the Libyan coast guard res­cued 47 peo­ple and re­cov­ered 31 bod­ies, in­clud­ing the re­mains of at least one child, the United Na­tions agency said.</p>
    <p>Just hours later, Doc­tors With­out Bor­ders (MSF) said a sec­ond ship­wreck off the Libyan coast had killed 20 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>MSF teams in the north-western coastal city of Sor­man “as­sisted three women as the lone sur­vivors of an­other ship­wreck where 20 peo­ple drowned”, the group said on Twit­ter on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“Res­cued by lo­cal fish­er­men, they were in shock and ter­ri­fied; they saw loved ones dis­ap­pear be­neath the waves, dy­ing in front of their eyes,” it added.</p>
    <p>The two deadly in­ci­dents are just the lat­est on the no­to­ri­ously dan­ger­ous jour­ney for mi­grants trav­el­ling from North Africa to Europe, across the Mediter­ranean.</p>
    <p>At least eight other ves­sels car­ry­ing mi­grants have sunk in the cen­tral Mediter­ranean since Oct 1. And at least 900 peo­ple have drowned in the Mediter­ranean while try­ing to reach Europe this year, some be­cause of de­layed res­cue mis­sions.</p>
    <p>More than 11,000 oth­ers res­cued or in­ter­cepted at sea have been re­turned to Libya, putting them at risk of hu­man rights abuses, in­clud­ing de­ten­tion, abuse, traf­fick­ing and ex­ploita­tion, the IOM said.</p>
    <p>In the past two days alone, at least 19 peo­ple, in­clud­ing two chil­dren, have drowned af­ter two boats cap­sized in the cen­tral Mediter­ranean, while Open Arms – the only ship op­er­at­ing in the area that is run by a non-govern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion – has res­cued more than 200 peo­ple in three op­er­a­tions, the UN agency said.</p>
    <p>“The mount­ing loss of life in the Mediter­ranean is a man­i­fes­ta­tion of the in­abil­ity of states to take de­ci­sive ac­tion to re­de­ploy much needed, ded­i­cated search-and-res­cue ca­pac­ity in the dead­li­est sea cross­ing in the world,” said Mr Fed­erico Soda, the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s chief of mis­sion in Libya.</p>
    <p>The twin dis­as­ter comes weeks af­ter at least 140 mi­grants drowned when their boat sank off Sene­gal in the dead­li­est wreck this year.</p>
