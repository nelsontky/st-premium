    <p>•</p>
    <p>Over the past few weeks, Face­book’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Mark Zucker­berg and his lieu­tenants have watched the pres­i­den­tial race with an in­creas­ing sense of alarm. Ex­ec­u­tives have held meet­ings to dis­cuss US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s eva­sive com­ments about whether he would ac­cept a peace­ful trans­fer of power if he lost the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>They watched Mr Trump tell the Proud Boys, a far-right group that has en­dorsed vi­o­lence, to “stand back and stand by”.</p>
    <p>And they have had con­ver­sa­tions with civil rights groups, who have pri­vately told them that the com­pany needs to do more be­cause Elec­tion Day could erupt i nto chaos, Face­book em­ploy­ees said. That has re­sulted in new ac­tions. On Wed­nes­day, Face­book said it would take more pre­ven­tive mea­sures to keep po­lit­i­cal can­di­dates from us­ing it to ma­nip­u­late the elec­tion’s out­come and its af­ter­math.</p>
    <p>The com­pany now plans to pro­hibit all po­lit­i­cal and is­sue-based ad­ver­tis­ing af­ter the polls close on Nov 3 for an un­de­ter­mined length of time.</p>
    <p>And it said it would place no­ti­fi­ca­tions at the top of the News Feed no­ti­fy­ing peo­ple that no win­ner had been de­cided un­til a vic­tor was de­clared by news out­lets.</p>
    <p>“This is shap­ing up to be a very unique elec­tion,” Mr Guy Rosen, vice-pres­i­dent for in­tegrity at Face­book, said in a call with re­porters on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Face­book is do­ing more to safe­guard its plat­form af­ter in­tro­duc­ing mea­sures to re­duce elec­tion mis­in­for­ma­tion and in­ter­fer­ence on its site just last month. At the time, it said it planned to ban new po­lit­i­cal ads for a con­tained pe­riod – the week be­fore Elec­tion Day – and would act swiftly against posts that tried to dis­suade peo­ple from vot­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Zucker­berg also said Face­book would not make any other changes un­til there was an of­fi­cial elec­tion re­sult.</p>
    <p>But the ad­di­tional moves un­der­score the sense of emer­gency about the elec­tion, as the level of con­tentious­ness has risen be­tween Mr Trump and his Demo­crat op­po­nent Joe Bi­den.</p>
