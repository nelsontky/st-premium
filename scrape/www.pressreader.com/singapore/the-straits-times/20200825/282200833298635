    <p>Core in­fla­tion fell deeper i nto neg­a­tive ter­ri­tory last month due to a steeper de­cline in the cost of elec­tric­ity and gas, and lower in­fla­tion for non-cooked food.</p>
    <p>Core in­fla­tion, which ex­cludes ac­com­mo­da­tion and pri­vate road trans­port costs, came in at mi­nus 0.4 per cent in July, down from mi­nus 0.2 per cent in June. This is the low­est since core in­fla­tion hit mi­nus 0.5 per cent in Jan­uary 2010.</p>
    <p>It was the sixth straight month of core con­sumer prices fall­ing below the same pe­riod a year ago.</p>
    <p>A smaller de­cline in the cost of pri­vate trans­port saw over­all in­fla­tion ease slightly last month to mi­nus 0.4 per cent, from mi­nus 0.5 per cent in June, ac­cord­ing to data re­leased by the Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) and Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Pri­vate trans­port costs fell at a slower pace of 2.1 per cent in July, com­pared with the 4.4 per cent drop in June, as car prices rose.</p>
    <p>The cost of re­tail and other goods also recorded a smaller de­cline at mi­nus 1.6 per cent last month, com­pared with mi­nus 1.8 per cent in June, as the prices of telecom­mu­ni­ca­tion equip­ment rose and the fall in house­hold durables and per­sonal care prod­uct prices mod­er­ated.</p>
    <p>The cost of elec­tric­ity and gas saw a much sharper fall in July at neg­a­tive 15.2 per cent, com­pared with mi­nus 3.9 per cent in June, mainly due to a steeper de­cline in elec­tric­ity prices as the elec­tric­ity tar­iff was re­vised down­wards.</p>
    <p>While in­fla­tion for non-cooked food fell in July, food ser­vices in­fla­tion re­mained broadly un­changed.</p>
    <p>Food in­fla­tion edged down slightly at 2.2 per cent in July, com­pared with 2.3 per cent in June.</p>
    <p>Ac­com­mo­da­tion in­fla­tion in July fell to 0.4 per cent, com­pared with 0.5 per cent in June, as hous­ing rents in­creased at a slower pace.</p>
    <p>Ser­vices cost also eased last month, at neg­a­tive 0.8 per cent com­pared with mi­nus 1 per cent the month be­fore, as hol­i­day ex­penses and air­fares fell at a slower pace while the cost of telecom­mu­ni­ca­tion ser­vices rose more rapidly.</p>
    <p>MAS and MTI noted that in the quar­ters ahead, ex­ter­nal sources of in­fla­tion are likely to re­main be­nign amid weak global de­mand con­di­tions. “Oil prices are ex­pected to stay low for an ex­tended pe­riod, while in­ter­na­tional food com­mod­ity prices have also de­clined. How­ever, sup­ply chain dis­rup­tions as­so­ci­ated with in­ter­na­tional mea­sures to con­tain the Covid-19 out­break could con­tinue to keep im­ported food prices el­e­vated,” they said.</p>
    <p>Do­mes­ti­cally, sub­dued eco­nomic sen­ti­ment and weak labour mar­ket con­di­tions will dampen con­sumer de­mand, cap­ping price rises for dis­cre­tionary goods and ser­vices, they added. “Cost pres­sures are likely to re­main low as some de­gree of spare ca­pac­ity in the econ­omy emerges.”</p>
    <p>MAS and MTI fore­cast core in­fla­tion and over­all in­fla­tion to av­er­age be­tween mi­nus 1 per cent and 0 per cent this year. Mean­while, an­a­lysts ex­pect in­fla­tion for the full year to be in the neg­a­tive ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>United Overseas Bank econ­o­mist Barn­abas Gan said the rate of de­fla­tion could ta­per if Sin­ga­pore’s tourism in­dus­try picks up amid the eas­ing of in­bound travel re­stric­tions. How­ever, de­fla­tion pres­sures are ex­pected to per­sist for the rest of this year, he added.</p>
    <p>“The mix of fall­ing do­mes­tic and tourism-led de­mand, cou­pled with low oil prices for the rest of 2020, are for­mi­da­ble head­winds against con­sumer prices. Mean­while, the weak labour mar­ket that is ex­pected to con­tinue should cap in­creases for dis­cre­tionary goods and ser­vices de­mand, ” he wrote in a note.</p>
