    <p>A “sense­less” ar­gu­ment be­tween two hawk­ers at Wham­poa Mar­ket ended with a fish­ball noo­dle stall as­sis­tant splash­ing hot water on the chest of a prawn noo­dle stall owner.</p>
    <p>The at­tack caused the vic­tim to suf­fer se­vere burns that left her breast per­ma­nently dis­fig­ured.</p>
    <p>The as­sailant, Kim Eng Suthivanic­h, 52, was ini­tially cleared of a charge of caus­ing hurt to the 46-year-old vic­tim by means of a heated sub­stance.</p>
    <p>She was ac­quit­ted by a district judge who ac­cepted her con­tention that she did not know the water was hot and was likely to cause hurt.</p>
    <p>But the High Court re­versed the ac­quit­tal in June, fol­low­ing an ap­peal by pros­e­cu­tors who de­scribed the as­sault as a “vi­cious one-way at­tack” .</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Suthivanic­h was sen­tenced to 10 months’ jail and or­dered to pay com­pen­sa­tion of $225.93 to the vic­tim, Ms Leow Suat Hong.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Ms Leow had per­mis­sion from the owner of the fish­ball noo­dle stall, Mr Sim Kok Soon, to bor­row things from his stall and use his fridge.</p>
    <p>On the morning of Aug 13, 2017, Ms Leow went over to his stall to get cook­ing in­gre­di­ents.</p>
    <p>An ar­gu­ment broke out be­tween the two women. Suthivanic­h, who was em­ployed by Mr Sim, said Ms Leow had not re­turned the clean­ing lo­tion and cloth that she had taken but the lat­ter de­nied tak­ing the items.</p>
    <p>En­raged, Suthivanic­h told the vic­tim to get out of the stall. She then grabbed a la­dle, scooped water from the stove and splashed it at the vic­tim mul­ti­ple times.</p>
    <p>When Ms Leow ran out to call the po­lice, Suthivanic­h went in pur­suit and used the la­dle to knock the phone from the vic­tim’s hands.</p>
    <p>The as­sault was cap­tured on CCTV.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim was later given 17 days’ med­i­cal leave for her in­juries.</p>
    <p>In June, High Court judge Aedit Ab­dul­lah con­victed Suthivanic­h, say­ing that the ac­quit­tal went against the weight of the ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Aedit said a rea­son­able per­son in the ac­cused’s po­si­tion would con­clude that the water would have been hot and have known that hurt was likely to be caused.</p>
    <p>“This was after all a stall serv­ing hot food,” said the judge.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the pros­e­cu­tion sought 12 months’ jail, ar­gu­ing that the scald­ing not only left the vic­tim’s breast per­ma­nently dis­fig­ured but also caused her to suf­fer psy­cho­log­i­cal and emo­tional trauma.</p>
    <p>The in­juries caused her to lose self-con­fi­dence and af­fected her abil­ity to start a re­la­tion­ship for fear that her part­ner will leave her as her body is “in­com­plete”, said sub­mis­sions by Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tors Bha­jan­vir Singh and Deli­cia Tan.</p>
