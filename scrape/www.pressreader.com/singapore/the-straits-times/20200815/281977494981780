    <p>For once, I am go­ing to agree with Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump in his use of his favourite ad­jec­tive – “huge”.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment bro­kered by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion for the United Arab Emi­rates (UAE) to es­tab­lish full nor­mal­i­sa­tion of re­la­tions with Is­rael, in re­turn for the Jewish state for­go­ing, for now, any an­nex­a­tion of the West Bank, was ex­actly what Mr Trump said it was in his tweet: A “HUGE break­through”.</p>
    <p>It is not An­war Sa­dat go­ing to Jerusalem – noth­ing could match that first big open­ing be­tween Arabs and Is­raelis.</p>
    <p>It is not Yasser Arafat shak­ing Yitzhak Rabin’s hand on the White House lawn – noth­ing could match that first mo­ment of pub­lic rec­on­cil­i­a­tion be­tween Is­raelis and Pales­tini­ans. But it is close.</p>
    <p>Just go down the score­card, and you see how this deal af­fects ev­ery ma­jor party in the re­gion – with those in the pro-Amer­i­can, pro-mod­er­ate Is­lam, pro-end­ingthe-con­flict-with-Is­rael-once-and­for-all camp ben­e­fit­ing the most and those in the rad­i­cal pro-Iran, anti-Amer­i­can, pro-Is­lamist per­ma­nent-strug­gle-with-Is­rael camp all be­com­ing more iso­lated and left be­hind.</p>
    <p>It’s a geopo­lit­i­cal earth­quake. To fully ap­pre­ci­ate why, you need to start with the in­ter­nal dy­nam­ics of the deal. It was Mr Trump’s peace plan drawn up by Mr Jared</p>
    <p>Kush­ner, and their will­ing­ness to stick with it, that ac­tu­ally cre­ated the raw ma­te­rial for this break­through. Here is how.</p>
    <p>The Kush­ner plan ba­si­cally called for Is­rael and the Pales­tini­ans to make peace, with Is­rael be­ing able to an­nex some 30 per cent of the West Bank, where most of its set­tlers were, and the Pales­tini­ans get­ting to es­tab­lish a de­mil­i­tarised, patch­work state on the other 70 per cent, along with some land swops from Is­rael.</p>
    <p>The Pales­tini­ans re­jected the deal out­right as un­bal­anced and un­just.</p>
    <p>But Is­raeli Prime Min­is­ter Ben­jamin Ne­tanyahu, who ba­si­cally helped to write the very pro-Is­rael plan, said he in­tended to pro­ceed with the an­nex­a­tion part of the plan by July 1 – with­out agree­ing to the part that his po­lit­i­cal base of Jewish set­tlers re­jected: Pales­tini­ans later get­ting a state on the other 70 per cent. (I won­der if Mr Trump’s Am­bas­sador to Is­rael David Fried­man, a pro-set­tler ex­trem­ist him­self, en­cour­aged Bibi to think he could get away with this.)</p>
    <p>It didn’t work, be­cause Mr Kush­ner, who was hear­ing reg­u­larly from Egypt, Jor­dan and the Gulf Arabs that such a uni­lat­eral Is­raeli an­nex­a­tion would be a to­tal deal-breaker for them, told Bibi: “Not so fast.”</p>
    <p>Mr Kush­ner per­suaded Mr Trump to block Bibi’s cherry-pick­ing of the plan by tak­ing an­nex­a­tion now.</p>
    <p>This was caus­ing Mr Ne­tanyahu to lose sup­port from the set­tlers – and, at a time when he is on trial on cor­rup­tion charges and fac­ing daily protests out­side his home over his poor per­for­mance in lead­ing Is­rael out of the coron­avirus pan­demic, left him sink­ing in the polls.</p>
    <p>So what Mr Trump, Mr Kush­ner, Crown Prince Sheikh Mo­hammed Bin Zayed, the de facto leader of the Emi­rates, and Mr Ne­tanyahu did was turn lemons into le­mon­ade, ex­plained Pro­fes­sor Ita­mar Rabi­novich, one of Is­rael’s lead­ing Mid­dle East his­to­ri­ans and a former am­bas­sador to Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>“In­stead of Is­raeli an­nex­a­tion for a Pales­tinian state, they made it Is­raeli non-an­nex­a­tion in re­turn for peace with the UAE,” said</p>
    <p>Prof Rabi­novich in an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>Mr Kush­ner, he added, “ba­si­cally gen­er­ated an as­set out of noth­ing, which Is­rael could then trade for peace with the UAE. It was peace for peace, not land for peace”.</p>
    <p>This process ap­par­ently started after the UAE’s Am­bas­sador to Wash­ing­ton Yousef al-Otaiba pub­lished a let­ter in He­brew in Is­raeli news­pa­per Ye­diot Ahronot in June, di­rectly warn­ing that Is­raeli an­nex­a­tion of the West Bank would un­der­mine the quiet progress Is­rael had made with the Gulf Arabs.</p>
    <p>The UAE had been mulling over go­ing for more open diplo­matic ties with Is­rael for a while, but it was the dis­cus­sions over how to stop an­nex­a­tion that cre­ated a frame­work in which the UAE could be seen as get­ting some­thing for the Pales­tini­ans in re­turn for its nor­mal­i­sa­tion with Is­rael.</p>
    <p>The Ne­tanyahu dy­nam­ics here are fas­ci­nat­ing, or as Is­raeli writer Ari Shavit re­marked to me: “Ne­tanyahu is try­ing to get out of his own per­sonal Water­gate by go­ing to China. He’s like Nixon in re­verse.”</p>
    <p>What he meant was that Mr Ne­tanyahu had been do­ing ev­ery­thing he could to ap­pease the right-wing forces in Is­rael – with shiny ob­jects like an­nex­a­tion – so they would side with him in his cor­rup­tion trial against Is­rael’s court sys­tem and At­tor­ney-Gen­eral.</p>
    <p>By tak­ing this deal,</p>
    <p>Mr Ne­tanyahu, as Nixon did with China, aban­doned his nat­u­ral ide­o­log­i­cal al­lies – the set­tlers who sup­ported him be­cause they thought he would de­liver an­nex­a­tion – “and this will force Ne­tanyahu to be­come more de­pen­dent on the cen­tre and cen­tre-right in Is­rael go­ing for­ward”, Mr Shavit said.</p>
    <p>“This deal may help save Is­raeli democ­racy by now de­priv­ing Bibi” of the full army of right-wing forces “he needed to de­stroy the Is­raeli Supreme Court”.</p>
    <p>The Pales­tinian Au­thor­ity, led by Mr Mah­moud Ab­bas, was also stripped of some­thing by this deal, which may force him to the ne­go­ti­at­ing ta­ble.</p>
    <p>It stripped him of his big­gest ace in the hole – the idea that the Gulf Arabs would nor­malise with Is­rael only after the Is­raelis sat­is­fied the de­mands of the Pales­tinian Au­thor­ity with a state to its lik­ing.</p>
    <p>(Free ad­vice for Mr Ab­bas: Come back to the ta­ble now and say you view the Trump plan as a “floor”, not a “ceil­ing” for Pales­tinian as­pi­ra­tions. You will find a lot of sup­port from Mr Trump, the Euro­peans and the Arabs for that po­si­tion. You still have lever­age. Is­rael still has to deal with you, be­cause your peo­ple in the West Bank are not go­ing to just dis­ap­pear, no mat­ter what hap­pens with the UAE and Is­rael.)</p>
    <p>This deal will cer­tainly en­cour­age the other Gulf sheikhdoms – Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia – all of which have had covert and overt busi­ness and in­tel­li­gence deal­ings with Is­rael, to fol­low the Emi­rates’ lead.</p>
    <p>They will not want to let the UAE have a leg-up in be­ing able to marry its fi­nan­cial cap­i­tal with Is­rael’s cy­ber tech­nol­ogy, agri­cul­ture tech­nol­ogy and health­care tech­nol­ogy, with the po­ten­tial to make both coun­tries stronger and more pros­per­ous.</p>
    <p>Three other big win­ners here are:</p>
    <p>• King Ab­dul­lah of Jor­dan. He feared that Is­raeli an­nex­a­tion would en­er­gise ef­forts to turn Jor­dan into the Pales­tinian state. That threat is for the mo­ment de­fused.</p>
    <p>• The Amer­i­can Jewish com­mu­nity. If Is­rael had an­nexed part of the West Bank, it would have di­vided ev­ery syn­a­gogue and Jewish com­mu­nity in Amer­ica, be­tween hard­line an­nex­a­tion­ists and lib­eral anti-an­nex­a­tion­ists. This was a looming dis­as­ter. Gone for now. • Mr Joe Bi­den. Mr Bi­den, if he suc­ceeds Trump, will not have to worry about the thorny is­sue of an­nex­a­tion, and he should have a much stronger pro-Amer­i­can al­liance in the re­gion to work with.</p>
    <p>The big geopo­lit­i­cal losers are Iran and all of its prox­ies: Hizbol­lah, the Iraqi mili­tias, Syr­ian Pres­i­dent Bashar al-As­sad, Ha­mas, Is­lamic mil­i­tants, the Houthis in Ye­men and Tur­key. This is for a num­ber of rea­sons.</p>
    <p>Up to now, the UAE has kept up a del­i­cate bal­ance be­tween Iran and Is­rael, not look­ing to pro­voke Iran, and deal­ing with Is­rael covertly.</p>
    <p>But this deal is right in Iran’s face. The tacit mes­sage is: “We now have Is­rael on our side, so don’t mess with us.”</p>
    <p>The vast dam­age Is­rael in­flicted on Iran through ap­par­ent cy­ber war­fare in re­cent months may have even given the UAE more breath­ing room to do this deal.</p>
    <p>But there is an­other mes­sage, deeper, more psy­cho­log­i­cal.</p>
    <p>This was the UAE telling the Ira­ni­ans and all their prox­ies: There are re­ally two coali­tions in the re­gion to­day – those who want to let the fu­ture bury the past and those who want to let the past keep bury­ing the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>The UAE is tak­ing the helm of the first, and it is leav­ing Iran to be the leader of the sec­ond.</p>
    <p>When the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion as­sas­si­nated Ma­jor-Gen­eral Qassem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Quds Force, the for­eign op­er­a­tions branch of Iran’s Revo­lu­tion­ary Guard, in Jan­uary, I wrote a col­umn say­ing that Amer­ica had just killed “the dumb­est man in Iran”.</p>
    <p>Why? Be­cause what was his busi­ness model, which be­came Shi’ite Iran’s busi­ness model?</p>
    <p>It was to hire Arab and other Shi’ites to fight Arab Sun­nis in Iraq, Le­banon, Ye­men and Syria – to project Iran’s power.</p>
    <p>And what was the re­sult of all this? Iran has helped to turn all four into failed states.</p>
    <p>Iran’s cler­i­cal lead­er­ship has be­come the largest fa­cil­i­ta­tor of state fail­ure in the Mid­dle East – in­clud­ing its own – which is why so many Le­banese blame it and Hizbol­lah for their coun­try’s mis­man­age­ment that led to the dev­as­tat­ing ex­plo­sion last week in Beirut’s port.</p>
    <p>I have fol­lowed the Mid­dle East for too long to ever write the sen­tence “the re­gion will never be the same again”. The forces of sec­tar­i­an­ism, trib­al­ism, cor­rup­tion and anti-plu­ral­ism run deep there.</p>
    <p>But there are other cur­rents – young men and women who are just so tired of the old game, the old fights, the old wounds be­ing stoked over and over again. You could see them demon­strat­ing all over the streets of Beirut last week de­mand­ing good gov­er­nance and a chance to re­alise their full po­ten­tial.</p>
    <p>The UAE and Is­rael and the US on Thurs­day showed – at least for one brief shin­ing mo­ment – that the past does not al­ways have to bury the fu­ture, that the haters and di­viders don’t al­ways have to win.</p>
    <p>It was a breath of fresh air. May it one day soon turn into a howl­ing wind of change that spreads across the whole re­gion.</p>
