    <p>If you have laughed at con­tes­tants in ob­sta­cle-course game show Wipe­out (2008 to 2014), wa­ter park Hy­droDash at Sen­tosa will make you eat hum­ble pie.</p>
    <p>Well, I used to be one of those peo­ple. Smugly spread-ea­gled on the sofa be­fore the TV, the round and bouncy ob­sta­cles on the small screen seemed un­in­tim­i­dat­ing. To an arm­chair spec­ta­tor, the jumps looked easy.</p>
    <p>Even on the ground at Palawan Beach, the bright yel­low, blue and green in­flat­able ob­sta­cles ap­pear be­nign, like bouncy cas­tles at a chil­dren’s party.</p>
    <p>But one step onto the slick plat­form and con­ceit goes out the win­dow.</p>
    <p>Even the in­flat­able walk­way lead­ing to the course is a chal­lenge. I strug­gle to gain a firm foot­ing and fall to my knees more than once. By the time I get the hang of it – mere walk­ing, mind you – it is time to take on the first ob­sta­cle.</p>
    <p>The park is loosely di­vided into four quad­rants, in­clud­ing one for chil­dren aged five and six.</p>
    <p>Skate and sing at a roller rink, shoot zom­bies and clam­ber on high nets, bounce and leap off float­ing ob­sta­cles, and wan­der through mazes at th­ese play­grounds for adults</p>
    <p>Launched in March and re­opened in July af­ter the cir­cuit breaker, it is de­signed to take up to 220 peo­ple any one time, but now has a 50-peo­ple limit. When The Sun­day Times vis­ited on a week­day af­ter­noon, about 25 peo­ple were on the course, most of them chil­dren.</p>
    <p>In­deed, on this float­ing play­ground, kids reign supreme.</p>
    <p>Gear­ing up for the first ob­sta­cle, I at­tempt a run­ning start to leap be­tween logs spaced half a me­tre apart. I slip and land on my belly, nar­rowly avoid­ing a face-plant. Since I am al­ready hor­i­zon­tal, I belly crawl across the logs, much to the amuse­ment of an eight-yearold.</p>
    <p>“You mean you don’t know how to do this?” he teases, leap­ing across ef­fort­lessly.</p>
    <p>The pre­co­cious, gap-toothed boy be­comes my un­of­fi­cial guide, al­ter­nately sham­ing and goad­ing me on.</p>
    <p>“Are you a child or an adult?” he asks, when I hes­i­tate atop a tall slide. Not one to back down from a chal­lenge, his nig­gling is the push I need.</p>
    <p>At a swing­ing ob­sta­cle, he demon­strates the jump, then turns around to hand me the bar.</p>
    <p>“Swing your l egs across!” he ex­horts. I land in the wa­ter any­way.</p>
    <p>Noth­ing is bruised ex­cept my pride.</p>
    <p>A step-up system, built into the course, makes it easy for adult legs to clam­ber back up. Plenty of life­guards are on hand to scoop up lit­tle ones if needed. And life jack­ets, which par­tic­i­pants must wear, keep me afloat as I bob be­tween plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Just as well, as the course is de­signed so that even the most dex­ter­ous must en­dure the in­dig­nity of a spill or two.</p>
    <p>Per­haps our bod­ies have been taught cau­tion and fear, i n the process of grow­ing up, to pro­tect our­selves against in­jury. So it feels won­der­fully free­ing to re­lin­quish con­trol, give in to grav­ity and en­joy the free­dom of falling.</p>
    <p>When I col­lect my valu­ables at the counter af­ter­wards – the park has a stor­age ser­vice for mo­bile phones and wal­lets, while clothes and tow­els can be left on the beach – the woman at the counter smiles know­ingly at my ex­haus­tion.</p>
    <p>Long-ne­glected mus­cles will be sore the next day. But I feel sur­pris­ingly joy­ful. Amid a stress­ful year, good old-fash­ioned play­time has been an un­ex­pected salve.</p>
    <p>Pro tip: Book a slot in the late af­ter­noon, if you can, when the mid­day heat has sub­sided.</p>
    <p>For adults, an hour is plenty.</p>
