    <p>After reg­is­ter­ing on an app, vis­i­tors to Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s (NTU) Jurong cam­pus will no longer have to think about where or how to pay their park­ing fees.</p>
    <p>Even with­out park­ing gantries, their car plates will be cap­tured on en­try and exit by video tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The cor­rect fee is then au­to­mat­i­cally cal­cu­lated and billed to their credit or debit card, with­out the need for ad­di­tional in­put of in­for­ma­tion in any other app or a CashCard in the in-ve­hi­cle unit.</p>
    <p>The vi­sion is of a more seam­less and has­sle-free park­ing ex­pe­ri­ence than cur­rently of­fered else­where.</p>
    <p>Launched on Mon­day, Sin­ga­pore’s “first bar­ri­er­free smart carpark” is now op­er­a­tional at three lo­ca­tions in the univer­sity. All 59 of NTU’s carparks, cov­er­ing more than 4,000 park­ing spa­ces, are set to turn “smart” by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>“Smart carparks are in­te­gral to the smart cities of the fu­ture,” said Mr Ravin­der Singh, the pres­i­dent of ST Engi­neer­ing’s elec­tron­ics arm, which de­vel­oped the new sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The smart carpark sys­tem works with an app called GoParkin. In ad­di­tion to tap­ping tech­nol­ogy such as au­to­matic num­ber plate recog­ni­tion, the app gives users real-time in­for­ma­tion on the clos­est avail­able park­ing spots and their rates.</p>
    <p>Apart from in­creas­ing con­ve­nience, the sys­tem also helps re­duce op­er­a­tional and maintenanc­e costs.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, it has a cloud-based plat­form which can iden­tify equip­ment in the carpark that re­quires pre­ven­tive maintenanc­e, sav­ing the univer­sity costs that would be in­curred later if the equip­ment were to break down.</p>
    <p>With re­mote pay­ment, the univer­sity is also able to do away with phys­i­cal pay­ment sta­tions or gantries at the carparks.</p>
    <p>The smart sys­tem is also equipped to col­lect data, which can be an­a­lysed to give op­er­a­tors a bet­ter sense of how the carparks are used and where im­prove­ments can be made.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh, whose com­pany is man­ag­ing all NTU carparks, said the data col­lected on carpark us­age could “po­ten­tially gen­er­ate new value-added ser­vices for mo­torists and trans­form busi­ness mod­els for carpark op­er­a­tors”.</p>
