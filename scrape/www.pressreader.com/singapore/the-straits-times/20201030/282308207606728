    <p>Talks are on­go­ing be­tween the Min­istry of Health (MOH) and the de­vel­op­ers of a Covid-19 “breathal­yser” test kit that gives re­sults in less than a minute to see if the tests can be de­ployed in pub­lic places in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>The chair­man of Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) spin-off Breathonix, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Neo Kok Beng, said the firm is also in talks with a “ma­jor hos­pi­tal­ity player” here to de­ploy the tests at events such as con­fer­ences fol­low­ing ap­proval from the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity.</p>
    <p>The com­pany hopes to re­ceive the ap­proval in the first quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>Prof Neo de­clined to name the hos­pi­tal­ity player. He added that Breathonix has also re­ceived some re­quests from groups over­seas for the tests to be rolled out there.</p>
    <p>For the test, peo­ple blow into a dis­pos­able mouth­piece that is con­nected to a breath sam­pler.</p>
    <p>A mass spec­trom­e­ter analy­ses the in­vis­i­ble par­ti­cles called volatile or­ganic com­pounds (VOCs) in a per­son’s breath.</p>
    <p>A healthy per­son will have a dif­fer­ent VOC sig­na­ture from some­one who is ill, and dif­fer­ent ill­nesses pro­duce dif­fer­ent sig­na­tures.</p>
    <p>The re­sults are gen­er­ated au­to­mat­i­cally in un­der a minute, with­out the need for the sam­ple to be pro­cessed else­where.</p>
    <p>This makes the breath test more con­ve­nient and faster than the cur­rent poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) swab tests, which re­quire an ex­ter­nal lab­o­ra­tory to process sam­ples, and take a few days for re­sults to be re­turned.</p>
    <p>The re­sults of Breathonix’s test are also gen­er­ated faster than those of anti­gen rapid tests (ART), which take at least 15 min­utes to be known.</p>
    <p>The breath test is also non-in­va­sive, in con­trast to the PCR tests and ARTs which re­quire swabs to be in­serted into a per­son’s nos­trils and have been known to cause dis­com­fort.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, un­like a PCR test which re­quires skilled lab­o­ra­tory tech­ni­cians to process sam­ples, Breathonix’s ma­chine re­quires only about an hour of train­ing for a lay­man to op­er­ate, said the com­pany’s chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer and co-founder, Mr Du Fang.</p>
    <p>“Tech­ni­cally, any­one who knows how to op­er­ate a PC can do it,” he added.</p>
    <p>At its re­cent suc­cess­ful trial at the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases, the breath test also man­aged to pick up asymp­to­matic pa­tients – al­though Dr Jia Zhu­nan, chief ex­ec­u­tive and co-founder of Breathonix, cau­tioned that fur­ther stud­ies are needed.</p>
    <p>It has a 93 per cent sen­si­tiv­ity rate – the rate at which pos­i­tive cases are cor­rectly picked up – and a 95 per cent speci­ficity rate, which refers to the pro­por­tion of peo­ple who are virus-free who are cor­rectly iden­ti­fied as such.</p>
    <p>In com­par­i­son, the ARTs used at a re­cent pre-event test­ing pi­lot here had a sen­si­tiv­ity rate of about 82 per cent and a speci­ficity rate of 99 per cent.</p>
    <p>The breathal­yser is less sen­si­tive than a PCR test, which is con­sid­ered the “gold stan­dard” of Covid-19 de­tec­tion here, but Dr Jia pointed out that the breath test is not meant to be a di­ag­nos­tic one.</p>
    <p>“We’re not com­par­ing or com­pet­ing against the PCR test. The breath test is more of a first-level screen­ing de­vice,” she ex­plained.</p>
    <p>The ex­act cost of a breath test here will de­pend on sev­eral fac­tors, in­clud­ing the num­ber of tests con­ducted, but Prof Neo said that if around 5,000 peo­ple are tested per month us­ing one ma­chine, each test should cost around US$20 (S$27).</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, a PCR test here is es­ti­mated to cost around $200 per per­son. Mr Du added that as ARTs are cur­rently still un­der val­i­da­tion here, it is not known how much such tests cost.</p>
    <p>Dr Jia said that there are sev­eral mea­sures in place to pre­vent cross-con­tam­i­na­tion when us­ing the ma­chine. These in­clude us­ing a dis­pos­able mouth­piece and dis­pos­able tub­ing, a one way valve, and a fil­ter on top of the mouth­piece so only gas-based mol­e­cules can en­ter the de­vice.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, all sur­faces in­side the ma­chine in con­tact with the breath are heated to a high tem­per­a­ture and are self-sani­tis­ing.</p>
    <p>Prof Neo added that the ma­chine is able to run non-stop, 24 hours a day, for up to six months be­fore it needs to be re-cal­i­brated.</p>
    <p>This, com­bined with the quick and pain­less test­ing method, makes it ideal for de­ploy­ment at places with a high traf­fic flow such as air­ports.</p>
    <p>He said: “If you ask peo­ple to stay an­other two days or even 10 hours at the air­port (while wait­ing for test re­sults), that is not go­ing to be en­cour­ag­ing... so we have to look at the big­ger pic­ture. Rather than say­ing this is just a test, (we can ask) how does it fa­cil­i­tate the re­open­ing of the econ­omy?”</p>
