    <p>SAO PAULO • Leonardo DiCaprio has been chal­lenged by Brazil­ian Vice-Pres­i­dent Hamil­ton Mourao to an eight-hour hike in the Ama­zon, say­ing he wanted to show the Hol­ly­wood star the rain­for­est is not burn­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Mourao, who heads Pres­i­dent Jair Bol­sonaro’s task force on fight­ing de­for­esta­tion, took is­sue with DiCaprio re­post­ing an In­sta­gram video from The Guardian news­pa­per with i mages of the world’s big­gest rain­for­est in flames.</p>
    <p>“I’d like to in­vite our most re­cent critic, ac­tor Leonardo DiCaprio, to come with me to Sao Gabriel da Ca­choeira (in north­ern Brazil) and walk eight hours through the jun­gle,” Mr Mourao said at an event on sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment in the Ama­zon or­gan­ised by Brazil’s Na­tional In­dus­trial Con­fed­er­a­tion. “He’ll get a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of how things work in this im­mense re­gion.”</p>
    <p>DiCaprio, who has a foun­da­tion ded­i­cated to the en­vi­ron­ment, shared The Guardian’s post on his own In­sta­gram ac­count last Fri­day. The ac­com­pa­ny­ing cap­tion cited satel­lite data from Brazil’s space agency, INPE, show­ing the num­ber of fires in the Brazil­ian Ama­zon last month in­creased 28 per cent year on year, with early num­bers for this month also show­ing an in­crease.</p>
    <p>“Brazil’s pres­i­dent, Jair Bol­sonaro, is un­der pres­sure in­ter­na­tion­ally to curb the fires, but he has pub­licly doubted the sever­ity of them in the past, claim­ing op­po­nents and indige­nous com­mu­ni­ties were re­spon­si­ble,” said the post.</p>
    <p>Last year, as surg­ing fires in the Ama­zon pro­voked global out­cry, Mr Bol­sonaro ac­cused DiCaprio of fund­ing fires in the Ama­zon, with­out pre­sent­ing any ev­i­dence. DiCaprio, 45, de­nied the al­le­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>This year, the num­ber of fires rose in June and last month com­pared with a year ago, but in the first 15 days of this month, fires were down 17 per cent com­pared with a year ago, ac­cord­ing to gov­ern­ment data.</p>
    <p>De­for­esta­tion is up 34.5 per cent in the 12 months through last month, com­pared with the same pe­riod a year ago, pre­lim­i­nary gov­ern­ment data shows.</p>
