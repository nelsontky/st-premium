    <p>The guns have fallen silent in the six-week-long war be­tween Ar­me­nia and Azer­bai­jan, a con­flict in which up to 5,000 peo­ple have died, and tens of thou­sands more have been dis­placed.</p>
    <p>But the con­se­quences of the con­flict on the south-eastern edges of Europe are likely to be pro­found. For they presage a broader strate­gic realign­ment. And they also her­ald newer forms of war­fare.</p>
    <p>Ar­me­nia and Azer­bai­jan gained their in­de­pen­dence af­ter the col­lapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. But that is about the only thing the two have in com­mon.</p>
    <p>Although it dates back its ex­is­tence to thou­sands of years, Ar­me­nia re­mains a re­source-poor na­tion of just three mil­lion peo­ple. Azer­bai­jan, how­ever, is a 10 mil­lion-strong state with sub­stan­tial oil and nat­u­ral gas re­serves.</p>
    <p>The Ar­me­ni­ans are Chris­tian, while the Az­eris are Mus­lims. And the ri­valry be­tween the two is fu­elled by a bit­ter ter­ri­to­rial dis­pute over Nagorno-Karabakh, a</p>
    <p>large moun­tain­ous en­clave within Azer­bai­jan, pop­u­lated largely by Ar­me­ni­ans.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal Ar­me­nian rebels have con­trolled Nagorno-Karabakh for more than 30 years, with the as­sis­tance of the mil­i­tary from Ar­me­nia. And Azer­bai­jan has in­vested most of its en­er­gies on re­gain­ing ef­fec­tive con­trol over ter­ri­tory that in­ter­na­tional law re­gards as Az­eri.</p>
    <p>The con­flict has dragged on be­cause while Azer­bai­jan had the fi­nan­cial means to equip its much larger mil­i­tary, Ar­me­nia en­joyed a close al­liance with Russia. And the</p>
    <p>ten­sion suited Russia since it ren­dered the re­gion de­pen­dent on Moscow.</p>
    <p>The Az­eris compensate­d for Rus­sian in­flu­ence by re­ly­ing on neigh­bour­ing Turkey, with which they have close eth­nic and lin­guis­tic con­nec­tions. Yet that was not enough: the Ar­me­ni­ans not only held Nagorno-Karabakh, but also made deeper in­cur­sions in other parts of Azer­bai­jan.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­thing changed, how­ever, in late Septem­ber when Az­eri troops launched a sur­prise at­tack against Ar­me­nian forces. This was a care­fully planned of­fen­sive,</p>
    <p>se­cretly put to­gether by Az­eri Pres­i­dent Il­ham Aliyev with the di­rect back­ing of Turkey’s Pres­i­dent Re­cep Tayyip Er­do­gan.</p>
    <p>Not only were the Az­eri troops well-equipped and very well led, but they were also highly mo­bile, de­liv­er­ing one stun­ning blow af­ter an­other on Ar­me­nia’s po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>A par­tic­u­lar fea­ture of the war were Turkey’s Bayrak­tar TB2 at­tack drones, un­manned plat­forms which sim­ply pul­verised Ar­me­nian tanks, while other Is­raeli and Turk­ish-made drones pro­vided the Azer­bai­jani mil­i­tary com­mand with a real-time,</p>
    <p>ac­cu­rate pic­ture of the con­stantly chang­ing bat­tle­field as well as tar­get­ing in­for­ma­tion for Az­eri long-range ar­tillery and mis­siles.</p>
    <p>This was not just a con­fronta­tion be­tween two an­cient en­e­mies, but also a show of force in which Turkey was chal­leng­ing Russia for con­trol of the re­gion. And the Turks were do­ing so with their own tech­nol­ogy, rather than hav­ing to rely on Western-made weapons, a new si­t­u­a­tion which will trans­form fu­ture re­gional cal­cu­la­tions.</p>
    <p>There is no ques­tion that Russia was sur­prised by this</p>
    <p>Turk­ish-in­spired mil­i­tary of­fen­sive. But Moscow was also cir­cum­scribed in what it could do.</p>
    <p>Given the coro­n­avirus pan­demic which has al­ready in­flicted se­ri­ous dam­age on his econ­omy, Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin was re­luc­tant to in­ter­vene to save Ar­me­nia from de­feat.</p>
    <p>Be­sides, Mr Putin never trusted Ar­me­nian Prime Min­is­ter Nikol Pashinyan, a vet­eran op­po­si­tion jour­nal­ist who came to power two years ago on the back of a pop­u­lar re­bel­lion.</p>
    <p>The re­sult was that Ar­me­nia was both out­gunned and out­ma­noeu­vred. In a de­ci­sion which Prime Min­is­ter Pashinyan de­scribed as “ex­tremely painful for me per­son­ally and for our peo­ple”, Ar­me­nia agreed to hand over by Sun­day large swathes of ter­ri­tory to Azer­bai­jan, in re­turn for staving off to­tal de­feat and the po­ten­tial de­struc­tion of 25,000 of its sol­diers.</p>
    <p>The cease­fire deal sparked off mass anti-gov­ern­ment demon­stra­tions in Ar­me­nia, and ju­bi­la­tion in Azer­bai­jan. But the real win­ners are Russia and Turkey.</p>
    <p>As part of the deal, Russia has al­ready de­ployed around 2,000 of its own mil­i­tary to po­lice the sep­a­ra­tion be­tween Ar­me­nian and Az­eri forces.</p>
    <p>“The over­all re­sult of the au­tumn 2020 hos­til­i­ties seems to be in Moscow’s long-term in­ter­est,” writes Mr Pavel Fel­gen­hauer, one of Russia’s most prom­i­nent an­a­lysts. “Ar­me­nia has been weak­ened by its de­feat, its army is in tat­ters, and it will need Russia both to re­build its mil­i­tary and to guar­an­tee its sur­vival.”</p>
    <p>But the Az­eri mil­i­tary vic­tory also comes at a use­ful time for Pres­i­dent Er­do­gan, just as he is fac­ing po­lit­i­cal pres­sures at home and pres­sures on his econ­omy. The Turk­ish leader is now pro­ject­ing him­self in the im­age he likes best: as de­fender of Mus­lims, pro­tec­tor of Turkey’s clos­est al­lies and one of few world lead­ers not only able to stand up to Russia, but ac­tu­ally see Russia blink first.</p>
    <p>And this may well be just a skir­mish in a longer Turk­ish-Rus­sian con­fronta­tion over the fate of Syria and Libya, where the two are also lock­ing horns.</p>
