    <p>Pep Guardi­ola in­sisted he was un­con­cerned as Manch­ester City sat mid-ta­ble in the Premier League with a win, loss and draw from their open­ing three matches.</p>
    <p>The ti­tle favourites dropped more points on Satur­day as Leeds earned a 1-1 draw at El­land Road with a sec­ond-half equaliser from Ro­drigo Moreno.</p>
    <p>Ra­heem Ster­ling put the vis­i­tors ahead af­ter 17 minutes, but for the sec­ond straight league game fol­low­ing their 5-2 loss to Le­ices­ter, City could not make an early lead count.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing City’s back-to-back ti­tlewin­ning sea­sons un­der Guardi­ola, they were strong front run­ners – when they grabbed the opener on 65 oc­ca­sions, they went on to win 60 of those games.</p>
    <p>Now, they are al­ready play­ing catch up.</p>
    <p>City trail early pace­set­ters Ever­ton (12) by eight points, al­beit hav­ing played a game less, and face a tricky visit from Arsenal next af­ter the in­ter­na­tional break.</p>
    <p>“I’m not go­ing to start af­ter three games to think about if they (cham­pi­ons Liver­pool) are go­ing to win the league or if they’re go­ing to take a lot of advantage. It’s what it is,” Guardi­ola said af­ter City failed to win in suc­ces­sive games for the first time since De­cem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>“I know when we fin­ish the last one, I know when we come back this sea­son with the play­ers that we have and, as a man­ager, I’m sat­is­fied for what they have done so far. We had to set­tle a few things, still we are a lit­tle bit away at the best that we can do.”</p>
    <p>City had 12 shots at goal in the first half but Leeds im­proved dra­mat­i­cally af­ter the break, with Ro­drigo pounc­ing on a mis­take from City goal­keeper Eder­son in the 59th minute.</p>
    <p>With three de­fend­ers con­ced­ing penalties to Le­ices­ter, in­di­vid­ual er­rors have cost City, al­though Eder­son ar­guably earned his side a point.</p>
    <p>He tipped a goal-bound Ro­drigo header onto the bar on a night the hosts found the tar­get seven times com­pared to City’s two.</p>
    <p>“It was pos­si­ble to win the game, but it wouldn’t have been fair to have won,” said Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa, whose side out-passed City, com­plet­ing (351 to 313) more passes while hav­ing more of the ball (52.5 per cent).</p>
    <p>“We had to put on an im­mense phys­i­cal ef­fort to be able to be on even terms or slightly bet­ter than Manch­ester City for half the game. We had to sur­vive the be­gin­ning of the first half and the end of the sec­ond half.”</p>
