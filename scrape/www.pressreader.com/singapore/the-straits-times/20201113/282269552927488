    <p>AU­GUSTA • The 84th Masters be­gan in a sur­real at­mos­phere be­fore the storm ar­rived as Jack Nick­laus and Gary Player hit the cer­e­mo­nial first tee shots in near dark­ness at Au­gusta Na­tional yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Nick­laus and Player emerged from the club­house at 6.57am, the ex­act minute of sun­rise, and strode to the tee be­fore day­light had even punc­tu­ated the gloom of a light driz­zle, as a drone buzzed nearby to film the oc­ca­sion.</p>
    <p>De­spite this be­ing a Masters like no other, with­out spec­ta­tors due to coro­n­avirus con­cerns, sev­eral hun­dred peo­ple sur­rounded the tee, mostly mem­bers and guests.</p>
    <p>Player was first to strike. Swing­ing bet­ter than an 85-year-old has any right to do, he took a full back­swing and struck the ball down the left side of the fair­way.</p>
    <p>Nick­laus, 80, fol­lowed suit with a swing slightly shorter than in his hey­day that brought him 18 Ma­jors. He too found the fair­way.</p>
    <p>And with that the first Masters played in au­tumn was un­der­way.</p>
    <p>How­ever, heavy rain show­ers forced sus­pen­sion of the open­ing round only 35 min­utes af­ter the start of play, with only nine play­ers hav­ing com­pleted one hole.</p>
    <p>Nick­laus and Player, two veter­ans who are still able to hit good shots, are ex­am­ples of how old may still be gold in golf.</p>
    <p>At last year’s Masters, Bern­hard Langer, who won the Masters in 1985 and 1993, made his 26th cut at the tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>“I know it’s harder be­cause I’m get­ting older... But if I hit it well and I putt de­cent, I think I’ll still have chances to win,” the 63-yearold said.</p>
    <p>The Masters is unique among the four Ma­jor tour­na­ments. Older pros usu­ally con­tend in the early rounds. No one will be sur­prised if Fred Cou­ples, 61, the 1992 cham­pion, tops the leader­board af­ter yes­ter­day and to­day.</p>
    <p>Play­ers push­ing a mere 50 have won the tour­na­ment. Nick­laus was 46 when he won his sixth Masters in 1986. And, of course, last year’s cham­pion, Tiger Woods, was 43 at the time, mak­ing him the sec­on­dold­est Masters cham­pion.</p>
    <p>And be­cause only 50 play­ers and the ones who tie make the cut, these older play­ers are reg­u­larly beat­ing out golfers in their 20s and 30s to play on the week­end.</p>
    <p>One rea­son is that even though Au­gusta Na­tional has length­ened the course over the years – to 7,475 yards this year from about 7,000 yards 20 years ago – the well-guarded greens make the ap­proach shots mat­ter more.</p>
    <p>“They know the nu­ances of the course,” said Craig Har­mon, a golf teacher in Florida whose fa­ther, Claude, won the Masters in 1948.</p>
    <p>“You hit it on the wrong side of the hole you have no chance, even if you’re 10 feet away. Or you could be 40 feet away and go­ing for it.”</p>
    <p>Miguel An­gel Jimenez found more suc­cess at the Masters as his course knowl­edge in­creased. In 2014, at age 50, he fin­ished in fourth place, ahead of young stars Rickie Fowler and Matt Kuchar.</p>
    <p>“It is not that we play the course bet­ter as we get older,” he said. “It is that the more we play Au­gusta, the more ex­pe­ri­ence and knowl­edge we have of the course. Plus, pa­tience is vi­tal at Au­gusta, and we are prob­a­bly a lit­tle more pa­tient and less im­pul­sive as we get older.</p>
    <p>Many older play­ers have also con­tin­ued to stay fit and com­pet­i­tive.</p>
    <p>“In the 1970s, there was no Cham­pi­ons tour,” Har­mon said. “My dad would show up not hav­ing played a com­pet­i­tive round in five years. Now, with some­one like Fred­die Cou­ples, it en­ters his mind that he could win it.”</p>
    <p>Miller Brady, pres­i­dent of the Cham­pi­ons tour, said the con­tin­ued com­pe­ti­tion had in­deed helped play­ers’ longevity.</p>
    <p>“These guys, un­like the gen­er­a­tion be­fore them, are much health­ier into their 50s and 60s,” he said. “Look at Bern­hard Langer; he con­tin­ues to play well and win on the Cham­pi­ons tour.”</p>
    <p>For some sea­soned play­ers, there is a feel about Au­gusta. They un­der­stand that the Masters has a rhythm all its own, al­though it may be dif­fer­ent this year with­out the emo­tional sup­port of fans.</p>
    <p>“There are cer­tain in­ter­vals in a round that if you get by them, they spur your con­fi­dence,” said Ben Cren­shaw, who won the Masters in 1984 and 1995, when he was 43.</p>
    <p>“The course goads you into try­ing cer­tain things. In the tough ar­eas, like Amen Corner, you al­ways see spe­cial things hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>Larry Mize, who won the Masters in 1987, made the cut as re­cently as 2017 when he was 58. He said it was the de­sign of the course that al­lowed older play­ers to com­pete with younger play­ers.</p>
    <p>“There are many ways you can play that golf course,” Mize said. “You can bomb it and fly it up there. But a lot of holes you can run the ball up there, even on 18. It’s very long, but it’s still playable.”</p>
    <p>NOUS COUNTS It is not that we play the course bet­ter as we get older. It is that the more we play Au­gusta, the more ex­pe­ri­ence and knowl­edge we have of the course. Plus, pa­tience is vi­tal at Au­gusta, and we are prob­a­bly a lit­tle more pa­tient and less im­pul­sive as we get older. ’’ MIGUEL AN­GEL JIMENEZ, 56-year-old Spa­niard, who is mak­ing his 17th Masters ap­pear­ance.</p>
