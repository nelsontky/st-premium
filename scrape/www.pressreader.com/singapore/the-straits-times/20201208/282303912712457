    <p>Cap­i­taLand has formed a joint ven­ture (JV) to ac­quire and de­velop multi-family as­sets worth about US$300 mil­lion (S$401 mil­lion) in the United States.</p>
    <p>The JV will in­vest in as­sets in the south-east and south-west mar­kets of the US, with an ini­tial fo­cus on Austin, Texas, the prop­erty gi­ant said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The JV part­ner is an Austin­based real es­tate in­vest­ment, de­vel­op­ment and prop­erty man­age­ment firm that has de­vel­oped more than 25,000 multi-family units in the US since its in­cep­tion 25 years ago, Cap­i­taLand said.</p>
    <p>Both par­ties have ac­quired a free­hold land par­cel in the “high growth, tech­nol­ogy driven” city of Austin to de­velop the JV’s first multi-family project, the com­pany added.</p>
    <p>Cap­i­taLand holds an 80 per cent stake in the project, while its part­ner holds the re­main­ing 20 per cent.</p>
    <p>The 1.9ha land par­cel will be de­vel­oped into a mid-rise and green 341-unit sub­ur­ban multi-family prop­erty, which is ex­pected to be com­pleted in 2023.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Cap­i­taLand, the prop­erty is sit­u­ated close to com­mer­cial, res­i­den­tial and leisure ac­tiv­i­ties, and it is a five-minute drive from The Do­main, which is com­monly re­ferred to as “Austin’s sec­ond down­town”.</p>
    <p>The Do­main com­prises more than 1.8 mil­lion sq ft of re­tail ameni­ties and over 3.4 mil­lion sq ft of of­fice space, as well as 3,700 apart­ments and 900 ho­tel rooms.</p>
    <p>The up­com­ing de­vel­op­ment is also ad­ja­cent to the McKalla Place Ma­jor League Soccer sta­dium, which is slated to open in spring next year.</p>
    <p>De­signed to cater to res­i­dents in a post Covid-19 land­scape, the prop­erty will have fea­tures such as key­less en­try to the apart­ments, as well as smart home fea­tures.</p>
    <p>It will also of­fer a mix of stu­dios and one- and two-bed­room apart­ments, with sep­a­rate work and liv­ing ar­eas for res­i­dents to work from home, Cap­i­taLand said.</p>
    <p>Mr Dang Phan, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for the US at Cap­i­taLand In­ter­na­tional, said that across the US, multi-family rents have re­cov­ered faster than other as­set types dur­ing past re­ces­sions.</p>
    <p>“Prior to Covid-19, al­lo­ca­tion of in­vest­ment cap­i­tal to­wards the multi-family sec­tor has ex­ceeded that of other prop­erty types and the pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated this pref­er­ence.</p>
    <p>“Grow­ing our in­vest­ment in the re­silient, liq­uid and sta­ble-yield multi-family port­fo­lio will pro­vide in­come sta­bil­ity,” he added.</p>
    <p>With this new in­vest­ment, Cap­i­taLand will have $4.7 bil­lion of as­sets un­der man­age­ment in the US.</p>
