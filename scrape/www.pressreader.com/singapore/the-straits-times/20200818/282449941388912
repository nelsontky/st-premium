    <p>Comic artist Rachel Pang does not shy away from tough top­ics while cre­at­ing art. The 25-year-old makes comic strips about cur­rent af­fairs as well as var­i­ous so­cial is­sues such as racism and sexual assault.</p>
    <p>The artist re­searches on some top­ics be­fore draw­ing, but tries not to over­load the comic strips with facts.</p>
    <p>“I read up on top­ics to have enough in­for­ma­tion, but when I cre­ate comics, I al­ways an­chor them in my own per­spec­tive and emo­tions be­cause that’s how we ex­pe­ri­ence the world,” says Pang, whose In­sta­gram page (@rachel­pang­comics) has amassed about 13,000 fol­low­ers since it was started in Au­gust 2018.</p>
    <p>The artist, who has an ad­min­is­tra­tive job, says: “To learn to lis­ten to one an­other and to have mean­ing­ful dis­cus­sions – that’s a thing Sin­ga­pore is still build­ing up slowly. I don’t cre­ate comics hop­ing they will change peo­ple’s minds, but I’m happy when the art helps them to con­sider other per­spec­tives.”</p>
    <p>Pang is among a grow­ing num­ber of young, self-taught artists who are us­ing their craft to coax dis­cus­sion about so­cial is­sues and raise funds to help those in need.</p>
    <p>They are also tap­ping so­cial me­dia, espe­cially In­sta­gram, to share their art.</p>
    <p>One topic some have high­lighted is racism, which was widely dis­cussed af­ter African-Amer­i­can Ge­orge Floyd died in May while in po­lice cus­tody.</p>
    <p>Un­der­grad­u­ate Zan­natun Noor, 22, who posts her il­lus­tra­tions and cre­ations such as ear­rings and post­cards on her In­sta­gram ac­count (@col.b_), has also used the plat­form to speak out against racism.</p>
    <p>She felt that while there was much talk about the Black Lives Mat­ter movement world­wide, there was a lack of dis­cus­sion and aware­ness of racism in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“It didn’t make sense that some peo­ple are open to un­der­stand­ing racism in an­other coun­try, but obliv­i­ous to racism here, even though it’s not as ex­treme as it is in the United States,” says Zan­natun, who is study­ing chem­istry at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Uni­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>She has also col­lated quotes that re­flect her and her friends’ strug­gles as mem­bers of a mi­nor­ity race and pub­lished these on her In­sta­gram ac­count.</p>
    <p>One quote reads: “I spent so many years re­fus­ing to wear henna be­cause my teach­ers and class­mates would say it was un­pro­fes­sional or smelly, but now, it is con­sid­ered a cool trend by those same peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>To her sur­prise, her June 4 post with those quotes gar­nered more than 29,000 likes.</p>
    <p>Some peo­ple ac­knowl­edged they had made sim­i­lar racist remarks un­wit­tingly in the past and apol­o­gised for them.</p>
    <p>But there were those who left hate­ful com­ments, de­spite her ef­forts to phrase her post in as neu­tral a way as pos­si­ble, she notes.</p>
    <p>RAISING FUNDS THROUGH ART</p>
    <p>Be­sides ad­vo­cacy, some artists have been us­ing their skills to raise funds for those in need.</p>
    <p>Twenty-year-old Dor­cas Tang cham­pi­ons the con­ser­va­tion of nat­u­ral ar­eas and bio­di­ver­sity, which she be­came in­ter­ested in while study­ing sus­tain­able ur­ban de­sign and engi­neer­ing at Ngee Ann Polytech­nic.</p>
    <p>She hopes to study ar­chi­tec­ture in uni­ver­sity next.</p>
    <p>“But when we need more space, we are of­ten okay with tak­ing away the homes of other crea­tures to ful­fil our own needs. Even­tu­ally, the de­struc­tion of nat­u­ral ar­eas also adds to cli­mate change.”</p>
    <p>She adds that art helps to make mes­sages more digestible. “You don’t need to know jar­gon. You just need to have a sin­gle art­work for peo­ple to share and this is also the start­ing point for them to re­search deeper on their own.”</p>
    <p>She has used art on her In­sta­gram ac­count (@earth­todor­cas) to raise funds for wildlife and res­cue ef­forts in the wake of the Aus­tralia bushfire cri­sis ear­lier this year, among other causes.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Kiera See, 20, do­nates up to 20 per cent of her earn­ings from art sales. Her In­sta­gram ac­count (@sun­line_____) is pep­pered with photos of art­works in­spired by Ja­panese el­e­ments and char­ac­ters from Ja­panese an­i­ma­tion house Stu­dio Ghi­bli. The funds go to the Sin­ga­pore Red Cross and Covid-19 re­lief ef­forts such as The Courage Fund.</p>
    <p>She also raised $1,700 in June for or­gan­i­sa­tions re­lated to the Black Lives Mat­ter movement, by cre­at­ing art­works for clients who each do­nated at least $35 to char­i­ties of their choice.</p>
    <p>See, who will study nurs­ing at the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy next month, says: “I felt help­less at first be­cause my voice was so small and the sit­u­a­tion was hap­pen­ing so far away. I wanted to do some­thing more impactful than just be­ing a small voice, so I re­searched and sug­gested or­gan­i­sa­tions that clients could do­nate to.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides in­di­vid­ual ef­forts, there are also groups of artists who have banded to­gether to con­trib­ute to causes.</p>
    <p>A group of four artists raised about $390 in May for mi­grant work­ers here. The funds were do­nated to Project Prov­i­dence, which sup­ports the needs of for­eign­ers such as mi­grant work­ers liv­ing out­side dor­mi­to­ries, and the Covid-19 Mi­grant Sup­port Coali­tion.</p>
    <p>Founded by graphic de­signer Jean Kuah (@mochibud­dies), the group raised funds by sell­ing stick­ers and art prod­ucts de­pict­ing char­ac­ters car­ry­ing out tasks done by mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>Kuah, 26, also started a sim­i­lar group in Fe­bru­ary with fel­low artist Regine Yap, 24, to show their sup­port for health­care work­ers. The col­lec­tive of 15 artists raised more than $1,500 for ground-up ini­tia­tive HeartForSG, which de­liv­ers care pack­ages to health­care work­ers.</p>
    <p>Kuah says: “Peo­ple tend to keep stick­ers and will re­mem­ber that these are on­go­ing so­cial is­sues. Art also helps to keep them in­ter­ested and en­gaged and en­cour­ages them to have a greater aware­ness of these is­sues.”</p>
