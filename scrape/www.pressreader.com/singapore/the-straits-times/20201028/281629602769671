    <p>Not only does op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim’s lat­est bid to be­come Malaysia’s next prime min­is­ter look dead in the wa­ter, but his re­formist cre­den­tials have also been dented in the process, say po­lit­i­cal pun­dits.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri An­war claimed last month to have se­cured a strong ma­jor­ity to form a new gov­ern­ment – the third time he has made such a claim over the past dozen years. But his much-an­tic­i­pated au­di­ence with the King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah, two weeks ago to prove his claim did not im­me­di­ately yield the ex­pected re­sults.</p>
    <p>The King post­poned in­ter­views with party lead­ers to ver­ify Mr An­war’s claim of sup­port, af­ter a surge in coro­n­avirus cases prompted a par­tial lock­down in the cap­i­tal from Oct 14.</p>
    <p>In the in­ter­ven­ing weeks, it be­came in­creas­ingly ap­par­ent that Mr An­war’s bid was be­ing backed by sev­eral lead­ers from Umno, the largest party within Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s Perikatan Na­sional gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>In the early hours of yes­ter­day, af­ter a marathon meet­ing, Umno de­clared its con­tin­ued back­ing for Tan Sri Muhyid­din. Umno also re­asserted that it would not work with Mr An­war or the Demo­cratic</p>
    <p>Ac­tion Party (DAP), which is part of the Pakatan Hara­pan coali­tion that he leads.</p>
    <p>“It ap­pears the door is per­ma­nently closed for An­war in this term,” Bow­erGroup Asia di­rec­tor As­rul Hadi Ab­dul­lah Sani told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Mon­day’s events also threw up an unset­tling rev­e­la­tion – that Mr An­war was will­ing to team up with for­mer prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak, who has been con­victed of graft re­lat­ing to the 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had scan­dal, in his pur­suit of the top job.</p>
    <p>This has caused un­easi­ness among his al­lies, es­pe­cially DAP, which has the most MPs in Par­lia­ment. It also does not sit well with Mr An­war’s own Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat (PKR) and its anti-cor­rup­tion and so­cial jus­tice credo.</p>
    <p>“An­war’s re­formist cre­den­tials have taken a hard dent over his will­ing­ness to work with Na­jib, (Umno pres­i­dent) Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi and Umno,” Mr As­rul Hadi said, adding that Mr An­war may also have alien­ated his own sup­port­ers in PKR in the process.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war’s fail­ure in his prime min­is­te­rial bid may also play into the hands of for­mer Sabah Chief Min­is­ter Shafie Ap­dal, who was touted as a po­ten­tial new prime min­is­ter can­di­date for the op­po­si­tion bloc be­fore the re­cent Sabah state elec­tions. Datuk Seri Shafie is backed by DAP and for­mer prime min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad.</p>
    <p>Mr Shazwan Mustafa Ka­mal, a se­nior as­so­ciate at Vriens & Part­ners, a gov­ern­ment reg­u­la­tory af­fairs and po­lit­i­cal risk con­sul­tancy, said: “While An­war’s base sup­port­ers will likely re­main, the chal­lenge will be to at­tract first-time vot­ers, youth, to his cause as they may see him as some­one ob­sessed with only one agenda – to be PM.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor James Chin of the Univer­sity of Tas­ma­nia said there needs to be a gen­er­a­tional change in Malaysian pol­i­tics, and a pass­ing of the ba­ton to lead­ers two gen­er­a­tions be­low the cur­rent one.</p>
    <p>Both Mr An­war and Mr Muhyid­din are 73 years old. Mr Muhyid­din’s pre­de­ces­sor, Tun Dr Ma­hathir, is 95 years old.</p>
    <p>“The cur­rent lead­ers have failed Malaysia con­sis­tently. By any met­ric, they have failed the coun­try spec­tac­u­larly,” Prof Chin told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>But he said Mr An­war will re­main rel­e­vant as PKR was cre­ated as his ve­hi­cle and there are no vi­able per­son­al­i­ties that could take over the party lead­er­ship from him.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery time there is trou­ble in Malaysia, peo­ple will look to him to be­come PM. That is why when he seeks sup­port, many peo­ple will say ‘yes’ to him. But a lot of th­ese peo­ple are very fickle-minded, so that is why the num­bers could never be proved,” Prof Chin said.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war – a for­mer deputy prime min­is­ter – claimed a par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity in 2008, months af­ter a gen­eral elec­tion that saw then rul­ing Barisan Na­sional coali­tion lose its two-thirds ma­jor­ity. How­ever, his plan ul­ti­mately did not ma­te­ri­alise and he was un­able to prove his ma­jor­ity on the de­clared date.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war made another bid for the pre­mier­ship fol­low­ing Dr Ma­hathir’s res­ig­na­tion ear­lier this year in Fe­bru­ary, but failed to se­cure enough MPs to claim a ma­jor­ity dur­ing an au­di­ence with the King.</p>
