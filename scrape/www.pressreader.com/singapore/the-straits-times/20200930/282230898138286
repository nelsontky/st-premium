    <p>•</p>
    <p>LeBron James and the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers be­gin the fi­nal challenge in their bid to re­turn to the sum­mit of bas­ket­ball to­day when they take on the Mi­ami Heat in Game 1 of the NBA Fi­nals.</p>
    <p>A full 11 months after the 2019-2020 Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) sea­son tipped off, a marathon cam­paign plunged into cri­sis by Covid-19 and tu­mul­tuous so­cial un­rest fi­nally reaches its cli­max in Or­lando.</p>
    <p>The fact that the sea­son has man­aged to reach the home stretch is it­self a tri­umph of sorts, a tes­ta­ment to as­sid­u­ous plan­ning by league of­fi­cials to cre­ate a se­cure “bub­ble” at Dis­ney World in Florida.</p>
    <p>Since July, teams have been housed at the en­ter­tain­ment park in Or­lando, largely se­questered from the out­side world and the virus which has claimed more than 204,000 lives in Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>Even then, the sea­son has not been im­mune from ex­ter­nal forces. A month ago, the sea­son threat­ened to un­ravel as a tide of anger against racial in­jus­tice prompted teams led by the Mil­wau­kee Bucks to boy­cott games.</p>
    <p>The Lak­ers, who will be chas­ing a record-equalling 17th NBA cham­pi­onship against Mi­ami, were one of two teams who re­port­edly voted to aban­don the sea­son on Aug 26.</p>
    <p>A lit­tle over one month later, and the 35-year-old James is now gird­ing him­self for a 10th ap­pear­ance in an NBA Fi­nals. It also marks the vin­di­ca­tion of his de­ci­sion in 2018 to leave the Cleve­land Cava­liers for the Lak­ers, a faded su­per­power of the NBA who were floun­der­ing be­fore his ar­rival.</p>
    <p>Although James’ first sea­son in Los An­ge­les ended in dis­ap­point­ment, with in­jury re­strict­ing his ap­pear­ances and the team once again fail­ing to make the play-offs, the bol­ster­ing of the squad with An­thony</p>
    <p>Davis last year re­turned the team to dom­i­nance.</p>
    <p>“This is what I came here for,” he said on Satur­day after the Lak­ers de­feated the Den­ver Nuggets 4-1 to clinch the Western Con­fer­ence cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>Stand­ing in the way of his bid for a fourth NBA cham­pi­onship are a Mi­ami team happy to be cast in the role of un­der­dogs.</p>
    <p>The Heat have ex­celled through the play-offs with Jimmy But­ler, Bam Ade­bayo and Go­ran Dragic out­stand­ing, rout­ing the top-seeded Mil­wau­kee Bucks 4-1 in the Eastern Con­fer­ence semi-fi­nals be­fore ac­count­ing for the Bos­ton Celtics 4-2.</p>
    <p>But­ler, who joined Mi­ami last year from the Philadel­phia 76ers, says the team must neu­tralise James to have any chance against the Lak­ers.</p>
    <p>NBA Fi­nals LeBron James has reached in his 17-year ca­reer.</p>
