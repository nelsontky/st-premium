    <p>De­spite the global cri­sis and ac­cel­er­ated change caused by Covid-19, Sin­ga­pore can sur­vive and thrive if it em­braces change with courage and con­fi­dence, while hold­ing true to the val­ues that have helped the coun­try to progress all th­ese years, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat told Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing dur­ing the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress, he noted that the econ­omy will change at a much more rapid pace, with dis­rup­tion to jobs be­com­ing more com­mon.</p>
    <p>But as Sin­ga­pore evolves its so­cial safety nets and strives to keep inequal­ity in check, Sin­ga­pore­ans must re­main rooted to the coun­try’s val­ues and iden­tity, and sense of unity as a peo­ple, he added.</p>
    <p>Val­ues like open­ness, mul­ti­cul­tur­al­ism and self-de­ter­mi­na­tion have served Sin­ga­pore well and re­main cru­cial, but it will take more ef­fort to main­tain a sense of com­mon pur­pose as so­ci­ety be­comes more di­verse, said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>New dif­fer­ences along the lines of iden­tity, so­cio-eco­nomic sta­tus and po­lit­i­cal be­liefs will emerge, while there will al­ways be dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives on sub­jects like race, lan­guage and re­li­gion, and the rights and obli­ga­tions of cit­i­zen­ship.</p>
    <p>“It is es­sen­tial that we rise above our dif­fer­ences and find com­mon ground,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We may not al­ways agree, but we can­not af­ford to let our dis­agree­ment turn into di­vi­sion. Oth­er­wise, change will cause a rup­ture in so­ci­ety as we have seen else­where.”</p>
    <p>Mr Heng gave the as­sur­ance that the Govern­ment will adapt so­cial safety nets to sus­tain the prom­ise of progress for ev­ery Sin­ga­porean.</p>
    <p>A job re­mains the best form of wel­fare, he said, adding that the Govern­ment will con­tinue to invest in peo­ple and match them to new op­por­tu­ni­ties to bring out the best in them.</p>
    <p>At the same time, so­cial spend­ing has tripled over the last 15 years. This will rise as the pop­u­la­tion ages.</p>
    <p>The shift to “gig econ­omy” jobs, for in­stance, means Sin­ga­pore’s sup­port for self-em­ployed per­sons must evolve, even as work to up­lift low­er­wage work­ers con­tin­ues.</p>
    <p>While the Govern­ment will keep an open mind to pro­posed ideas, such as a min­i­mum wage, uni­ver­sal ba­sic in­come and un­em­ploy­ment in­sur­ance, peo­ple must recog­nise there are no magic bul­lets, he said. Each of th­ese ideas has its mer­its but also un­in­tended ef­fects, he added, cau­tion­ing against look­ing for “what may ap­pear to be cost­less solutions”.</p>
    <p>“Some­how, some­one else will have to pay for th­ese schemes. There are trade-offs,” he said. “If we want higher so­cial spend­ing, taxes will have to go up. Or it will mean spend­ing more at the ex­pense of fu­ture gen­er­a­tions, like what many coun­tries are do­ing by rais­ing debt.”</p>
    <p>While so­cial safety nets will be strength­ened, this must be done in a way that re­in­forces – not un­der­mines – in­di­vid­ual ef­fort, he added.</p>
    <p>This should be funded eq­ui­tably and sus­tain­ably, and strengthen peo­ple’s ca­pac­ity to both suc­ceed and help oth­ers suc­ceed, he said.</p>
    <p>“A so­cial safety net can­not be­come a set of shack­les. It should not hold down those who started with less. It should not cre­ate de­pen­dency, such that peo­ple who get fish for to­day, never learn how to fish for food to­mor­row,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said a well-de­signed so­cial safety net pro­tects the vul­ner­a­ble, in­vests in hu­man and so­ci­etal cap­i­tal, and pro­vides a means for those who fall down to bounce back.</p>
    <p>“It sup­ports ev­ery gen­er­a­tion to have as­pi­ra­tions and dreams, and for ev­ery­one to ask: What more can we do for one an­other?”</p>
    <p>He was also glad that amid the pan­demic, many have stepped up to sup­port oth­ers. He cited the Masks Sewn With Love project, where vol­un­teers sewed over 100,000 masks for vul­ner­a­ble fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>How well Sin­ga­pore emerges from the present cri­sis de­pends on its abil­ity to adapt while hold­ing true to its val­ues, said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>“We are both a city state and a global me­trop­o­lis – main­tain­ing this ‘dual iden­tity’ will not be easy,” he said. “But as long as we are clear about our val­ues and what holds us to­gether, it will be a source of strength that opens up new op­por­tu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>He em­pha­sised the Govern­ment’s com­mit­ment to build­ing deeper part­ner­ships with cit­i­zens, cit­ing the Sin­ga­pore To­gether move­ment launched last year to har­ness di­verse ideas and shape a shared fu­ture.</p>
    <p>He shared how his fel­low East Coast GRC MPs re­cently en­gaged Ms Sa­man­tha Thian and a group of vol­un­teers who reg­u­larly clean the beach at East Coast Park, and fol­lowed up with them last Satur­day via video chat to dis­cuss ways to cre­ate a more sus­tain­able Sin­ga­pore. “I am very im­pressed by their pas­sion and com­mit­ment (and) we agreed to work to­gether to turn their good ideas into action,” said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>Such part­ner­ships fos­ter a cul­ture of re­spect and ex­pand the com­mon space, strength­en­ing Sin­ga­pore’s ca­pac­ity to adapt, he noted.</p>
    <p>“We want to build on th­ese ef­forts too, as we re­cover from Covid-19,” he said, adding that this was why the Emerg­ing Stronger Con­ver­sa­tions have been con­vened to give Sin­ga­pore­ans a shared op­por­tu­nity to re­flect on their Covid-19 ex­pe­ri­ence and ar­tic­u­late how they can take Sin­ga­pore for­ward to­gether.</p>
