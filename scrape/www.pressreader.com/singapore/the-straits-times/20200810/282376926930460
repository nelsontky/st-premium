    <p>NEW YORK • Af­ter her lat­est long and un­ex­pected break from the sport she once dom­i­nated, Ser­ena Wil­liams will re­turn to com­pe­ti­tion to­day at a new tour­na­ment, the Top Seed Open in Lex­ing­ton, Kentucky – the first WTA Tour event held in the United States since early March.</p>
    <p>What is dif­fer­ent about this lay­off is that her come­back to tour-level ten­nis will be part of ev­ery­one else’s.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sional play­ers have been on hia­tus be­cause the coro­n­avirus pan­demic shut down both the men’s and women’s cir­cuits in early March.</p>
    <p>The Top Seed Open will just be the third event since the dis­rup­tion – the Palermo Open ended yes­ter­day, while the Prague Open is tak­ing place con­cur­rently.</p>
    <p>“That’s the big­gest dif­fer­ence,” Wil­liams, who is the only top-10 player in the event’s draw and is the big­gest name apart for her sis­ter Venus and teenage sen­sa­tion Coco Gauff, said on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>“In­stead of me be­ing in­jured, it’s kind of like ev­ery­one had to take a break and a pause, and it will be re­ally fun and in­ter­est­ing to see how we play.</p>
    <p>“I feel like ev­ery­one has an op­por­tu­nity to ac­tu­ally be more fit now, be­cause we spent so much time at home to just kind of work on your­self and your life and your game.”</p>
    <p>The ques­tion is, how does this col­lec­tive break af­fect Wil­liams’ chances of win­ning the US Open, which is sched­uled to be­gin on Aug 31?</p>
    <p>“I think she has the same chances that she has had since the birth of her daugh­ter (in 2017),” her coach Pa­trick Mouratoglo­u said. “She ab­so­lutely has the level. It still de­pends a great deal on her whether she wins a Grand Slam. Covid, for me, has changed ab­so­lutely noth­ing in that depart­ment.”</p>
    <p>Even at this late stage in her ca­reer, the French­man is adamant Wil­liams can win her 24th Grand Slam sin­gles ti­tle and tie Mar­garet Court’s record.</p>
    <p>She has come ag­o­nis­ingly close. Since re­turn­ing to the WTA Tour in 2018 af­ter a dif­fi­cult child­birth, she has reached four Grand Slam fi­nals – two at Wim­ble­don and two at the US Open – los­ing all of them in straight sets.</p>
    <p>Af­ter win­ning her first tour­na­ment since be­com­ing a mother in Jan­uary in Auck­land, New Zealand, she suf­fered a shock third-round loss at the Aus­tralian Open to China’s Wang Qiang and has not played a com­pet­i­tive match since Fe­bru­ary’s Fed Cup.</p>
    <p>There were doubts about Wil­liams’ fit­ness and abil­ity to han­dle the big­gest mo­ments be­fore the pan­demic, and th­ese re­main as she re­turns at age 38 with the US Open, which she has won six times, again in her sights.</p>
    <p>Con­firm­ing her in­ten­tion to play not only at Flush­ing Mead­ows, which has been hit by a string of high-pro­file with­drawals, but also the French Open start­ing on Sept 27, the former world No. 1 said: “I see my­self do­ing it all if it hap­pens.”</p>
    <p>That does not mean she is dis­re­gard­ing the dan­gers of be­ing ex­posed to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Wil­liams, who has a his­tory of blood clots and has had life-threat­en­ing pul­monary em­bolisms that af­fected her lungs, po­ten­tially faces greater risks than an av­er­age world-class ath­lete if she con­tracts the virus.</p>
    <p>“I don’t have full lung ca­pac­ity, so I’m not sure what would hap­pen to me,” she said. “I’m sure I’ll be OK but I don’t want to find out. I have like 50 masks I travel with. I never want to be with­out one.”</p>
    <p>The world No. 9 also re­vealed that the cri­sis has turned her into “a lit­tle bit of a recluse”, mostly stay­ing at home in Palm Beach Gar­dens, Florida, with her hus­band, Alexis Oha­nian, and their two-year-old daugh­ter, Olympia.</p>
    <p>Win­ning her 24th sin­gles Slam with a new gen­er­a­tion of play­ers ris­ing would, how­ever, be per­haps her finest achieve­ment and the sit­u­a­tion in which ten­nis finds it­self only makes the chase more in­trigu­ing.</p>
    <p>“If she wins this US Open as her 24th, it will be the tough­est Grand Slam ti­tle she’s ever go­ing to win or maybe any­body for that mat­ter,” said Chris Evert, an 18-time Ma­jor sin­gles cham­pion.</p>
    <p>The hard-court Grand Slam will not have a full-strength field. Ash­leigh Barty of Aus­tralia, the No. 1 women’s sin­gles player, al­ready has with­drawn. So have No. 5 Elina Svitolina and No. 7 Kiki Bertens, and No. 2 Si­mona Halep is lean­ing that way, too.</p>
    <p>But ma­jor threats re­main. For Mouratoglo­u, the key for Wil­liams to break her drought in New York is not to block out No. 24.</p>
    <p>“When you have an ele­phant in the room, you can say you don’t see it, but it’s not easy to be­lieve it,” he said.</p>

She is press&#xAD;ing ahead with plans to play in the US Open de&#xAD;spite a wave of player with&#xAD;drawals over coro&#xAD;n&#xAD;avirus fears. She is also due to fea&#xAD;ture in the French Open, which starts two weeks af&#xAD;ter the New York event ends.</p>
