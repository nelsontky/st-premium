    <p>LIS­BON • It is a prob­lem that has con­founded man­agers and play­ers alike since 2004.</p>
    <p>How ex­actly do you stop a player like Lionel Messi?</p>
    <p>Bay­ern Mu­nich be­lieve they have the so­lu­tion ahead of to­day’s block­buster Cham­pi­ons League quar­ter­fi­nal clash with Barcelona in Por­tu­gal, but man-mark­ing the Ar­gen­tinian is not part of their plans.</p>
    <p>On lim­it­ing the in­flu­ence of the Barcelona skip­per, who pos­sesses the great­est threat to the Bun­desliga cham­pi­ons’ hopes of a sec­ond tre­ble and their sixth Euro­pean Cup, Ger­many in­ter­na­tional Leon Goret­zka said: “That can only be done col­lec­tively be­cause he is a gifted foot­baller.</p>
    <p>“Thou­sands of peo­ple be­fore me have tried to an­swer this ques­tion. It is nice – after play­ing against (Ju­ven­tus’ Cris­tiano) Ron­aldo a few times – to play the other for­ma­tive player of the last decade.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know how, but we have to force our game on them.”</p>
    <p>Tak­ing the game to Barca is eas­ier said than done, but if any team can do so, it will be Bay­ern.</p>
    <p>The Bavar­ian gi­ants have won all 13 games since Ger­man foot­ball restarted in May fol­low­ing the coro­n­avirus lock­down and un­der­lined their im­pres­sive form last Satur­day when Robert Le­wandowski, the Cham­pi­ons League’s top scorer, helped seal a 7-1 ag­gre­gate thrash­ing of Chelsea to book their lasteight berth.</p>
    <p>Barca, on the other hand, are star­ing at their first tro­phy­less sea­son in 12 years un­less they can win their sixth Euro­pean Cup.</p>
    <p>While An­toine Griez­mann put up a brave front, telling the club’s TV chan­nel that “we have the weapons to beat them”, the fail­ure to de­fend their Span­ish La Liga ti­tle as well as limp ex­its in the do­mes­tic Cups do not lend much con­fi­dence to his com­ments.</p>
    <p>Bay­ern have al­ready won the do­mes­tic dou­ble and are aim­ing to em­u­late Barca in be­com­ing just the sec­ond Euro­pean club to win the tre­ble twice.</p>
    <p>Seven years after their maiden ac­com­plish­ment and pow­ered by the hot form of Le­wandowski – he has al­ready notched a ca­reer-best 53 goals in all com­pe­ti­tions, in­clud­ing 13 in Europe – Goret­zka is feel­ing con­fi­dent.</p>
    <p>Some crit­ics be­lieve the knock­out for­mat of the “Fi­nal Eight”, which is Uefa’s so­lu­tion to the pan­demic, could even out to­day’s game as com­pared to the usual two-legged ties.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it may be more of a detri­ment to Barca as they can­not rely on the Nou Camp, where they are un­beaten in Europe since 2013, as their safe haven.</p>
    <p>And Goret­zka re­vealed Bay­ern have spent the past few weeks train­ing specif­i­cally for an as­sault on the Cham­pi­ons League. Un­like the rest of their ri­vals, the Ger­man Bun­desliga sea­son fin­ished al­most a month ear­lier.</p>
    <p>“There is no easy way now. We are here in the sun in Por­tu­gal and are prepar­ing for a knock­out game in the Cham­pi­ons League,” he said. “We’re re­ally up for it. Knock­out matches are great.</p>
    <p>“At the mo­ment, we’re play­ing as a unit, in ad­di­tion to the qual­ity of the in­di­vid­ual play­ers.</p>
    <p>“We have a clear plan in hand and our in­ten­sity with­out the ball can make the dif­fer­ence.”</p>
    <p>Both clubs know each other in­ti­mately, with four meet­ings since 2013 and there will be a re­union of sorts for both Barca’s Ar­turo Vi­dal and Bay­ern’s Thi­ago Al­can­tara, who is a prod­uct of Barca’s La Ma­sia academy, mak­ing to­day’s en­counter a likely clas­sic.</p>
    <p>On Vi­dal, who is fac­ing his for­mer side for the first time since leav­ing the Al­lianz Arena in 2018, Goret­zka said: “He has a first-class men­tal­ity with amaz­ing fit­ness.</p>
    <p>“I no­ticed that dur­ing fit­ness tests – which I took next to him – he can go be­yond the pain thresh­old.”</p>
