    <p>Sin­ga­pore will en­ter phase three of its re­open­ing in two weeks, on Dec 28, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The per­mit­ted group size for so­cial gath­er­ings will go up from five to eight, with ca­pac­ity lim­its at at­trac­tions, malls and places of wor­ship also set to be in­creased.</p>
    <p>But even as Sin­ga­pore­ans take the chance to re­con­nect with friends and fam­ily, they must con­tinue to keep their guard up as the bat­tle is far from won, PM Lee em­pha­sised in a tele­vised na­tional ad­dress.</p>
    <p>Around the world, the pan­demic is still rag­ing and many coun­tries are see­ing re­cur­rent waves of in­fec­tion with record numbers of daily cases, he said. “The Covid-19 virus has not been erad­i­cated. There is a long way to go.”</p>
    <p>The in­creased lim­its on so­cial gath­er­ings will al­low house­holds to re­ceive up to eight vis­i­tors at a time. At­trac­tions can start ap­ply­ing to the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board to in­crease their op­er­at­ing ca­pac­ity to up to 65 per cent, while re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions will be able to hold wor­ship ser­vices for up to 250 peo­ple, split up into groups of 50.</p>
    <p>Rules will also be re­laxed for mar­riage solem­ni­sa­tions and live per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>PM Lee ex­pressed his grat­i­tude to Sin­ga­pore­ans, who have com­plied with the spirit of the rules im­posed to keep Covid-19 at bay.</p>
    <p>“We stayed united, kept up our guard, and did not al­low our­selves to be­come com­pla­cent over time,” he said.</p>
    <p>“With ev­ery­one’s full sup­port, our en­hanced safe­guards worked, and we could grad­u­ally ease our re­stric­tions. We can be proud of how far we have come.”</p>
    <p>But PM Lee also stressed that the longer Sin­ga­pore’s bor­ders stay closed to trav­ellers, the greater the coun­try’s risk of los­ing out as an in­ter­na­tional hub, which will hurt Sin­ga­pore­ans’ liveli­hoods.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore must, there­fore, re­open its bor­ders in a “con­trolled and safe man­ner”, with the knowl­edge that it will see more im­ported cases which could spread to the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“This is a cal­cu­lated risk we have to ac­cept,” PM Lee said. “But the Gov­ern­ment will take every pre­cau­tion and do our best to pre­vent im­ported cases from trig­ger­ing a new out­break.”</p>
    <p>He added that the virus is likely still cir­cu­lat­ing silently within the Sin­ga­pore com­mu­nity, and Sin­ga­pore­ans should con­tinue to be watch­ful and cau­tious.</p>
    <p>“This is ab­so­lutely not the time to re­lax, and let our guard down or to hold a big party, imag­in­ing that the prob­lem has dis­ap­peared,” PM Lee said.</p>
    <p>The multi-min­is­te­rial task force tack­ling the pan­demic elab­o­rated on some of the an­nounce­ments PM Lee made, and also gave an up­date on mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>Work­ers in some dor­mi­to­ries will be al­lowed back into the com­mu­nity once a month, as part of a pi­lot scheme. To do so, these work­ers will have to un­dergo ros­tered rou­tine test­ing, wear con­tact trac­ing de­vices and com­ply with safe liv­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Round­ing up the press con­fer­ence that was broad­cast live, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said the risk of in­fec­tion will go up as more peo­ple are al­lowed to gather, and more so­cial and eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties re­sume.</p>
    <p>“That means the en­force­ment, the dis­ci­pline has to be strength­ened and tight­ened so we can con­tinue to con­tain the risk and keep the num­ber of cases as low as pos­si­ble, so we can have a smooth and safe jour­ney through phase three,” he added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will en­ter phase three of its re­open­ing in two weeks, on Dec 28, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong yes­ter­day. The per­mit­ted group size for so­cial gath­er­ings will go up from five to eight, with ca­pac­ity lim­its at at­trac­tions, malls and places of wor­ship to be in­creased. Rules will also be re­laxed for mar­riage solem­ni­sa­tions.</p>
