    <p>NEW YORK • The United States set a record for coro­n­avirus cases on Satur­day, with more than five mil­lion peo­ple now in­fected with the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>With one out of every 66 res­i­dents in­fected, the US leads the world in Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has recorded more than 160,000 deaths, nearly a quar­ter of the world’s to­tal.</p>
    <p>The grim mile­stone comes as US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump signed ex­ec­u­tive or­ders to pro­vide eco­nomic re­lief to Amer­i­cans hurt by the pan­demic af­ter the White House failed to reach a deal with Congress.</p>
    <p>Last Friday, the US Labour Depart­ment re­ported that US em­ploy­ment growth slowed con­sid­er­ably last month, un­der­scor­ing an ur­gent need for ad­di­tional govern­ment aid.</p>
    <p>Dr An­thony Fauci, the US govern­ment’s top in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert, last Wednesday said there could be at least one vac­cine that works and is safe by the year end.</p>
    <p>But Mr Trump of­fered a more op­ti­mistic view, say­ing it was pos­si­ble the US would have a coro­n­avirus vac­cine by the time of the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Brazil, the sec­ond worst-hit na­tion in the pan­demic, topped three mil­lion in­fec­tions and 100,000 deaths on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>In Europe, in­fec­tions are also ris­ing in some coun­tries. Ukraine yes­ter­day re­ported another 1,199 new cases with 18 deaths, af­ter a record spike of 1,489 reg­is­tered in­fec­tions the pre­vi­ous day. Neigh­bour­ing Hun­gary, which has de­picted it­self as a rel­a­tively safer zone, re­ported 43 new cases, the high­est since May.</p>
    <p>Ger­many’s num­ber of new cases fell to the low­est in a week at 707, but its re­pro­duc­tion fac­tor – or R value, a lag­ging in­di­ca­tor – rose to 1.32, the high­est in three weeks, mean­ing 100 in­fected peo­ple are es­ti­mated to spread the dis­ease to about 132 oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties may again turn stricter fol­low­ing out­breaks among har­vest work­ers, at a can­ning com­pany, and among re­turn­ing trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>In France, masks be­came manda­tory out­doors from to­day on the busiest streets of Paris. The spread of the virus ac­cel­er­ated in the coun­try last week, in­fect­ing in­creas­ingly younger peo­ple. The sci­en­tific coun­cil ad­vis­ing the govern­ment called on France’s 20 big­gest cities to pre­pare for a po­ten­tial new wave of con­fine­ments.</p>
    <p>Over in Iran, new cases dipped to a two-month low of 2,020, bring­ing to­tal in­fec­tions to 326,712. The death toll climbed to 18,427 with 163 more fa­tal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>But the fig­ures come at the end of a long week­end and public hol­i­day in the coun­try dur­ing which many Ira­ni­ans trav­elled across prov­inces, in what could cause a surge in in­fec­tions in the com­ing weeks.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam’s health min­istry yes­ter­day re­ported just two new in­fec­tions, down from 21 a day ear­lier, in an early in­di­ca­tion that the coun­try may have got its Danang out­break un­der con­trol.</p>

    <p>With one out of every 66 res­i­dents in­fected, the US leads the world in Covid-19 cases. The coun­try has recorded more than 160,000 deaths, nearly a quar­ter of the world’s to­tal.</p>
