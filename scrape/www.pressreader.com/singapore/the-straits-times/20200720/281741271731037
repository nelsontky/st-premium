    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) has au­tho­rised “pool test­ing” for Covid-19, a move aimed at broad­en­ing checks for the coro­n­avirus and us­ing fewer test­ing re­sources.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can clin­i­cal lab­o­ra­tory Quest Di­ag­nos­tics will be able to test sam­ples con­tain­ing as many as four in­di­vid­ual swab spec­i­mens, the FDA last Satur­day in an emer­gency-use au­tho­ri­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The sam­ples are then tested in a pool or “batch” us­ing one Covid-19 test, rather than run­ning each in­di­vid­ual sam­ple through its own test. If the pool is pos­i­tive it means that one or more of the in­di­vid­u­als tested may be in­fected, so each of the sam­ples in that pool is then tested again, in­di­vid­u­ally.</p>
    <p>The United States last Satur­day recorded 63,259 new coro­n­avirus cases over a 24-hour pe­riod, ac­cord­ing to Worl­dome­ter. That took the to­tal num­ber of cases in the US, the na­tion hard­est-hit by the global pan­demic, to 3,833,597 yes­ter­day, as per the lat­est data.</p>
    <p>An­other 813 deaths were re­ported on Satur­day and one yes­ter­day, tak­ing to­tal fa­tal­i­ties to 142,878. The lat­est num­bers cap a week which saw the US set­ting records in new cases for three con­sec­u­tive days, top­ping out at 77,638 in­fec­tions last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has seen a resur­gence of cases in the Sun Belt, stretch­ing across the south from Florida to Cal­i­for­nia. In Texas and Ari­zona, the au­thor­i­ties are bring­ing in re­frig­er­ated trucks to cope with the ris­ing body count.</p>
    <p>The surge in cases has prompted some states to back­track on loos­en­ing their anti-virus re­stric­tions – or to re­in­state tougher mea­sures.</p>
    <p>In just one week, the US records about as many deaths as the 5,600 lives Swe­den has lost since the pan­demic be­gan ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>The au­tho­ri­sa­tion for pool test­ing “is an im­por­tant step for­ward in get­ting more Covid-19 tests to more Amer­i­cans more quickly while pre­serv­ing test­ing sup­plies”, said FDA com­mis­sioner Stephen Hahn in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“Sam­ple pool­ing be­comes es­pe­cially im­por­tant as in­fec­tion rates de­cline and we be­gin test­ing larger por­tions of the pop­u­la­tion,” Dr Hahn said.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese of­fi­cials had used pool test­ing to quickly test vast num­bers of peo­ple i n Bei­jing and Wuhan ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>White House coro­n­avirus task force mem­bers An­thony Fauci and Deb­o­rah Birx have both spo­ken in favour of pool test­ing as a way to ramp up the num­ber of tests that can be per­formed.</p>
    <p>“Pool­ing would give us the ca­pac­ity to go from a half a mil­lion tests a day to po­ten­tially five mil­lion in­di­vid­u­als tested per day,” Dr Birx told an Amer­i­can So­ci­ety for Mi­cro­bi­ol­ogy vir­tual con­fer­ence in June, ac­cord­ing to the health news site Stat.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion is re­port­edly baulk­ing at US$25 bil­lion (S$34.7 bil­lion) in new fund­ing favoured by Repub­li­can law­mak­ers in the next re­lief Bill to help states with coro­n­avirus test­ing and con­tact trac­ing, ac­cord­ing to a per­son fa­mil­iar with the talks.</p>
    <p>Also op­posed is a plan to al­lo­cate bil­lions of ad­di­tional dol­lars for the Cen­tres for Disease Con­trol and Preven­tion, and ex­tra fund­ing for the Pen­tagon and State Depart­ment to ad­dress the out­break across the world, said the per­son.</p>
    <p>Talks are go­ing on be­fore the re­lease of the Bill and the sit­u­a­tion is fluid, the per­son said, with fi­nal num­bers far from be­ing nailed down. The per­son also said that Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steven Mnuchin has pro­posed that the health fund­ing be cut, and money in­cluded in­stead for a new FBI head­quar­ters, long a pri­or­ity for</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Mr Joe Bi­den, Mr Trump’s Demo­cratic chal­lenger in Novem­ber’s pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, has termed the ad­min­is­tra­tion’s ef­forts “ab­so­lutely un­con­scionable”.</p>
