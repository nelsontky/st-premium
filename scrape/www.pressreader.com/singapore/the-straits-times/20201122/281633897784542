    <p>Pres­sure is mount­ing on Hong Kong of­fi­cials to rein in the es­ca­lat­ing Covid-19 out­break that has popped the Sin­ga­pore-Hong Kong travel bub­ble ar­range­ment, with the territory’s govern­ment tight­en­ing mea­sures and mak­ing tests com­pul­sory for some.</p>
    <p>Live per­for­mances and danc­ing in bars and pubs will be banned, while premises such as party rooms for hold­ing so­cial gath­er­ings will be forced to shut for five days from to­day to Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness own­ers who breach th­ese new rules can be fined up to HK$50,000 (S$8,665) and jailed for six months, the govern­ment said in a me­dia re­lease yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam re­stated early yes­ter­day the health au­thor­i­ties’ up­date in a Face­book post, say­ing the pan­demic in the city has hit a “se­vere” stage. “Our pri­or­ity now is to quickly cut off trans­mis­sion through test­ing,” she said, adding that test­ing of those deemed high risk will be ramped up and her team will seek to en­cour­age more vol­un­tary test­ing.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials also an­nounced manda­tory tests for those who have vis­ited 14 dance premises – sites of the lat­est out­break.</p>
    <p>Th­ese mea­sures came af­ter Hong Kong yes­ter­day recorded 43 con­firmed cases – the high­est daily fig­ure in three months – of which 36 were lo­cal and 13 un­trace­able. This brings the tally in the city to 5,560 cases and 108 deaths. An­other group of more than 60 peo­ple was found to be pos­i­tive af­ter pre­lim­i­nary test­ing.</p>
    <p>Of the lat­est 43 cases, 21 were linked to Wan Chai district’s Starlight Dance Club, which is at the cen­tre of the dance group out­break. This brings the clus­ter to 32, in­clud­ing eight in­struc­tors.</p>
    <p>Dr Chuang Shuk Kwan, head of the com­mu­ni­ca­ble dis­ease branch at the Cen­tre for Health Pro­tec­tion said a cou­ple of pa­tients linked to the clus­ter had not been to the stu­dios, in­di­cat­ing signs of “su­per-spread­ing”.</p>
    <p>Hid­den trans­mis­sion links were also de­tected in mul­ti­ple districts in­clud­ing Wong Tai Sin, Mong Kok, Sham Shui Po, Tin Hau and Mid-Lev­els.</p>
    <p>“The num­bers are es­ca­lat­ing, so the trend of in­crease is very alarm­ing. We are very wor­ried that a fur­ther in­crease in cases will hap­pen, and it will be very dif­fi­cult to con­trol,” said Dr Chuang.</p>
    <p>The forced test­ing would be the first such move by the govern­ment af­ter the new law kicked in last Sun­day. Peo­ple who refuse a test can be forced to take it and be fined HK$2,000. Those who ig­nore the or­der may be jailed for up to six months and fined up to HK$25,000.</p>
    <p>Dr Lau Ka Hin of the Hos­pi­tal Author­ity said about 4,000 beds, in­clud­ing those at a tem­po­rary med­i­cal fa­cil­ity at the Asi­aWorldExpo near the air­port, will be avail­able if the out­break wors­ens.</p>
    <p>Flights orig­i­nally sched­uled to start to­day un­der the travel bub­ble ar­range­ment were sus­pended as the pan­demic in Hong Kong es­ca­lates. Both gov­ern­ments had agreed to sus­pend the bub­ble flights for two weeks if ei­ther city re­ported an av­er­age of five or more lo­cal trans­mis­sions a day over a seven-day pe­riod.</p>
    <p>For the seven days from Nov 15, Hong Kong recorded an av­er­age of 3.9 un­linked lo­cal cases, but with the fur­ther 60 pre­lim­i­nary pos­i­tive ones, to­day’s av­er­age would likely cross the thresh­old.</p>
    <p>Con­tent mar­ket­ing ex­ec­u­tive Fairoza Man­sor, 35, is among those dis­ap­pointed by yes­ter­day’s turn of events as she is booked on a flight to Hong Kong on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>She had de­cided to go ahead with the Nov 25 flight as she had to be back in the city for work.</p>
    <p>“So I’ve re­signed my­self to the two-week ho­tel quar­an­tine that Hong Kong has in place,” she said.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong-based mar­ket­ing ex­ec­u­tive Su­sanne Liu, 43, has dif­fer­ent con­cerns.</p>
    <p>She is wor­ried that the Sin­ga­pore govern­ment might tighten rules for peo­ple ar­riv­ing from the territory but said she “would keep go­ing (to Sin­ga­pore) even if quar­an­tine is re­quired” as she has been apart from her Sin­ga­porean hus­band for more than half a year.</p>
