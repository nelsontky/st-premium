    <p>Work­ers’ Party (WP) chair­man Sylvia Lim (Alju­nied GRC) has called on the Gov­ern­ment to adopt a two-pronged ap­proach to tackle short­com­ings in Sin­ga­pore’s crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem.</p>
    <p>One as­pect in­cludes re­forms to pro­ce­dures in­volv­ing com­po­si­tion fines, bail amounts, state­ment record­ing, train­ing and the po­si­tion of crime vic­tims, Ms Lim, a lawyer, told Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The other as­pect in­volves more com­plex is­sues, in­clud­ing con­sti­tu­tional mat­ters like the ques­tion of whether the equal pro­tec­tion of the law un­der Ar­ti­cle 12 of the Con­sti­tu­tion is, in prac­tice, be­ing af­forded to the poor. For such is­sues, she sug­gested set­ting up a Con­sti­tu­tional Com­mis­sion headed by a Supreme Court judge.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim was speak­ing on a mo­tion she had moved for de­bate on is­sues raised by a court case in­volv­ing Ms Parti Liyani, who was the maid of for­mer Changi Air­port Group and Sur­bana Jurong chair­man Liew Mun Leong.</p>
    <p>The mo­tion was sup­ported by Ms Lim’s fel­low WP MP He Ting Ru (Sengkang GRC).</p>
    <p>ON THE PLIGHT OF THE POOR IN AT­TAIN­ING JUS­TICE</p>
    <p>Ms Lim said Ms Parti’s case raised the ques­tion of whether Sin­ga­pore’s jus­tice sys­tem puts ev­ery­one on an equal foot­ing.</p>
    <p>Poorer and less ed­u­cated peo­ple are more likely to run afoul of the law be­cause of their cir­cum­stances, she noted, and they may also have dif­fi­culty rais­ing the re­sources needed to en­gage le­gal coun­sel, put up bail money and pay com­po­si­tion fines promptly.</p>
    <p>She said public agen­cies could con­sider al­low­ing com­po­si­tion fines to be paid by in­stal­ments. This would “pre­vent cases from snow­balling into big­ger court fines, de­faults and war­rants of ar­rest”.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim also sug­gested al­ter­na­tives to money-bail could be con­sid­ered, such as re­quir­ing the ac­cused per­son to main­tain em­ploy­ment or abide by cer­tain re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms He later said ex­ist­ing le­gal aid schemes such as the Crim­i­nal Le­gal Aid Scheme and the Ad Hoc Pro Bono Re­fer­ral Scheme should be en­hanced. These schemes are lim­ited in reach, she said, not­ing that there are a large num­ber of un­rep­re­sented per­sons, and that pro bono le­gal rep­re­sen­ta­tion largely re­lies on the good­will of lawyers.</p>
    <p>Another WP MP, Mr Ger­ald Giam (Alju­nied GRC), said mi­grant work­ers like Ms Parti face unique chal­lenges like non-pay­ment of salaries and un­fa­mil­iar­ity with Sin­ga­pore’s lan­guages, laws and cus­toms that could de­ter them from re­port­ing of­fences against them.</p>
    <p>He said sup­port ser­vices, in­clud­ing the pro­vi­sion of ba­sic needs such as food and shel­ter, should be pro­vided to all mi­grant work­ers who choose to make complaints against em­ploy­ers and find them­selves with­out a home and a job.</p>
    <p>SUG­GES­TIONS FOR LAW EN­FORCE­MENT AGEN­CIES</p>
    <p>Ms Lim said Ms Parti’s case shows prob­lems can arise with in­ter­pre­ta­tion of state­ments recorded in English. Ms Parti had spo­ken in Ba­hasa In­done­sia and her state­ment was recorded with the aid of an in­ter­preter.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim added that law en­force­ment agen­cies should at least fa­cil­i­tate the record­ing of state­ments in Sin­ga­pore’s other of­fi­cial lan­guages of Malay, Chi­nese and Tamil.</p>
    <p>She also said the use of video or au­dio-record­ing of state­ments should be ex­panded.</p>
    <p>Poorer and less ed­u­cated peo­ple are more likely to run afoul of the law be­cause of their cir­cum­stances, Ms Sylvia Lim noted... She said public agen­cies could con­sider al­low­ing com­po­si­tion fines to be paid by in­stal­ments. This would “pre­vent cases from snow­balling into big­ger court fines, de­faults and war­rants of ar­rest”.</p>
    <p>ON JUS­TICE FOR CRIME VIC­TIMS</p>
    <p>Ms Lim said jus­tice for crime vic­tims should be high­lighted in any re­view of the sys­tem even though it was not an is­sue in Ms Parti’s case.</p>
    <p>She noted that crime vic­tims have no say in how crim­i­nal cases are con­ducted as it is the public pros­e­cu­tor who de­cides which charges to press, if any.</p>
    <p>Vic­tims may even suf­fer “se­condary vic­tim­i­sa­tion” by the crim­i­nal jus­tice process, Ms Lim said, such as if they are dis­be­lieved by law en­force­ment or sub­ject to ridicule by lawyers dur­ing cros­sex­am­i­na­tion in court.</p>
    <p>She fur­ther said that more needs to be done to give crime vic­tims con­fi­dence that they will be fairly treated by the sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Ms He sug­gested that the statu­tory com­pen­sa­tion scheme for mis­car­riages of jus­tice should be bol­stered so that those who were wrongly con­victed of crimes are ad­e­quately com­pen­sated.</p>
