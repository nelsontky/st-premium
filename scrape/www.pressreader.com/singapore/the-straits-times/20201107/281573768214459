    <p>Mercedes driver Lewis Hamil­ton (right) raised his re­tire­ment briefly, and yet you know he will be around next sea­son. He is set to equal Michael Schu­macher’s seven For­mula One ti­tles this term, and this is a driver who al­ways wants to be ahead, says as­sis­tant sports edi­tor Ro­hit Bri­j­nath.</p>
    <p>Young men snif­fle and can’t speak and strong women brush away tears with cal­loused hands. Of all the acts in the grand opera that is sport, re­tire­ment can be the most dra­matic. Maybe in­jury has vis­ited, ex­haus­tion has set in or skill has dimmed. Ei­ther way what set them apart is be­ing bro­ken apart.</p>
    <p>It is a time of in­se­cu­rity, un­cer­tainty, re­flec­tion and lies. Some un­truths make you grin, some are just plain cheap. When re­tire­ment is turned into a ne­go­ti­a­tion for pay or a Conor McGre­gor ma­noeu­vre, it’s sim­ply de­mean­ing and bor­ing.</p>
    <p>But mostly it’s a dilemma. Ath­letes will think aloud about their next life. They will say that’s it and then stay for­ever. They will have sec­ond re­tire­ments and third come­backs. Nor­mal life isn’t al­ways suited for the ab­nor­mal. We un­der­stand.</p>
    <p>So Kim Cli­jsters was back again this year and it’s a com­pet­i­tive itch even Michael Jor­dan had to scratch. From the couch, the guys on TV never look that good. “I could take them”, the ath­lete’s mind says. The body replies, have a pizza, dude, but who lis­tens?</p>
    <p>Now it’s Lewis Hamil­ton’s turn to flirt a lit­tle. One neb­u­lous phrase from him – “I would like to be here next year, but there’s no guar­an­tee” – and print­ing presses were work­ing over­time. Could he quit? Se­ri­ously? Naaah. Walk away from his­tory? C’mon. Sure, ath­letes have sur­prised us by putting fam­ily, and life it­self, be­fore tro­phies. At 31, with a 49-0 record, Rocky Mar­ciano, a boxer with clar­ity of all things, quit with the words: “My lone­some fam­ily con­vinced me that I should quit while I’m still in good shape.”</p>
    <p>Bobby Jones won golf’s Grand Slam in 1930, re­tired the same year and once said: “First come my wife and chil­dren. Next comes my pro­fes­sion, the law. Fi­nally, and never as a life in it­self, comes golf.” He was 28 and never re­turned to his sport full-time.</p>
    <p>Noth­ing about re­tire­ment is easy and how can it be when you’re say­ing farewell to ev­ery­thing you’ve ever been good at. And so for­get ask­ing about their great­est mo­ment, just quiz an ath­lete about re­tire­ment and they’ll spill an emo­tional tale.</p>
    <p>Hur­dler Dipna Lim-Prasad fi­nally made her de­ci­sion to quit while sit­ting near Lake Khovs­gol in Mon­go­lia in</p>
    <p>2018. “A scary de­ci­sion” made in a placid place. “I said maybe I will come back be­cause it was scary to make it de­fin­i­tive.” So scary that she worked with her sports psy­chol­o­gist to help her “come to terms” with the clos­ing of this chap­ter. For 17 years, all she’d seen in the mir­ror was an ath­lete.</p>
    <p>Ath­letes miss the rou­tine, the big Games, the ca­ma­raderie, striv­ing, adu­la­tion. Lim-Prasad even­tu­ally longed for the in­ten­sity of train­ing. What ath­letes know, and we don’t, is a rare level of phys­i­cal mas­tery, a con­trol of body and a sharp­ness of tech­nique. It’s a kind of high-class pre­ci­sion, like a glass cut­ter at work, and it’s what she misses.</p>
    <p>What will Lewis miss, we’ll find out in his next book, but he’s not go­ing any­where right now. His life has been dis­tilled to the sin­gle idea of be­ing “ahead” and when he wins the ti­tle this year he’ll only be “equal” with Michael Schu­macher.</p>
    <p>So, re­tire? While joint first? You think Rafael Nadal, equal with his old Swiss pal on 20 Grand Slam ti­tles, won’t run his ru­ined knees a few thou­sand miles more?</p>
    <p>Great ath­letes want to stamp them­selves so hard on a sport that their ca­reer stays there like a Juras­sic Park foot­print. There’s a place past “great” called “sin­gu­lar”, which is where Hamil­ton wants to be. Mike Pow­ell, who broke the world long jump record in 1991, once told a news­pa­per: “I don’t want to see my record bro­ken... it will hurt me.” He’s still happy.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton, 35, later said that “all I can say is that I plan to be here next year” and per­haps his ear­lier “no guar­an­tee” quote was just the words of a tired ath­lete. There are things, such as his ac­tivism, which are far more im­por­tant than rac­ing and yet it is rac­ing which of­fers him a unique mega­phone.</p>
    <p>The faster he goes, the wider his voice trav­els.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton’s life has been dis­tilled to the sin­gle idea of be­ing “ahead” and when he wins the ti­tle this year he’ll only be “equal” with Michael Schu­macher. So, re­tire? While joint first?
