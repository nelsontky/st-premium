    <p>The At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC), the po­lice and the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) are look­ing into the case of a for­mer do­mes­tic worker ac­quit­ted of steal­ing from Changi Air­port Group chair­man Liew Mun Leong and his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>This comes af­ter Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn, in his 100-page judg­ment on the case last Fri­day, found the trial judge’s con­vic­tion against her to be un­safe.</p>
    <p>He cited the han­dling of the ev­i­dence by the po­lice, the record­ing of the al­legedly stolen items and the im­proper mo­tive be­hind the al­le­ga­tions of some fam­ily mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti Liyani, 46, who was work­ing for the Liew fam­ily from 2007 to 2016, was ac­cused of steal­ing more than $34,000 worth of items from them. Af­ter a trial in the State Courts, she was found guilty on four counts of theft and sen­tenced to jail for two years and two months in March last year.</p>
    <p>She ap­pealed to the High Court against her con­vic­tion and sen­tence, and was ac­quit­ted last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, the AGC said that it will study Jus­tice Chan’s judg­ment.</p>
    <p>This is to as­sess what fur­ther ac­tion, if any, ought to be taken in this case, in the light of Jus­tice Chan’s com­ments, the AGC added.</p>
    <p>In his judg­ment, Jus­tice Chan found that “some time prior to her ter­mi­na­tion”, Ms Parti had ex­pressed un­hap­pi­ness at be­ing made to do the ad­di­tional work of clean­ing the house and of­fice of Mr Liew’s son Karl Liew.</p>
    <p>“There is rea­son to be­lieve that the Liew fam­ily, upon re­al­is­ing her un­hap­pi­ness, took the pre-emp­tive first step to ter­mi­nate her em­ploy­ment sud­denly with­out giv­ing her suf­fi­cient time for her to pack, in the hope that Parti would not use the time to make a com­plaint to MOM,” he said.</p>
    <p>He also found that when Ms Parti threat­ened to com­plain to MOM af­ter her sud­den ter­mi­na­tion, the two Mr Liews lodged the po­lice re­port to pre­vent her re­turn to Sin­ga­pore to make the com­plaint.</p>
    <p>The AGC said Jus­tice Chan also dis­be­lieved the ev­i­dence of sev­eral mem­bers of the Liew fam­ily on var­i­ous is­sues. “His find­ings do raise ques­tions which war­rant fur­ther in­ves­ti­ga­tions,” it added.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate state­ment yes­ter­day, MOM said it is in con­sul­ta­tion with the AGC as to whether fur­ther ac­tion ought to be taken in this case.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said that in Oc­to­ber 2017, Ms Parti made a re­port about be­ing il­le­gally de­ployed by the el­der Mr Liew’s wife, Madam Ng Lai Peng, to her son’s res­i­dence be­tween Septem­ber and Oc­to­ber 2016, and to his of­fice around 2012 and 2013.</p>
    <p>MOM in­ves­ti­gated the com­plaint and found that this had hap­pened on dif­fer­ent oc­ca­sions. It then is­sued a cau­tion to Madam Ng and an ad­vi­sory to Mr Karl Liew.</p>
    <p>“The is­su­ing of a cau­tion, on these facts, is con­sis­tent with the ap­proach taken in other sim­i­lar cases,” added the min­istry.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said yes­ter­day that they would be look­ing into sev­eral ob­ser­va­tions on po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions made by Jus­tice Chan.</p>
    <p>While the po­lice state­ment did not elab­o­rate on what these ob­ser­va­tions were, the judge had found that there was a break in the chain of cus­tody of ev­i­dence. This cre­ated a rea­son­able doubt as to whether some of the al­legedly stolen items dis­cov­ered by the fam­ily were ac­cu­rately doc­u­mented by the pho­to­graphs taken by the po­lice some five weeks later.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing this pe­riod, the fam­ily were also told by the po­lice that they were free to use the items. They took and put back items into the boxes, but it was not clear if the items that were put back were the same ones re­moved ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan also found that two state­ments were taken from Ms Parti with­out an in­ter­preter.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted by The Straits Times, Mr Liew Mun Leong de­clined to com­ment on the judg­ment.</p>
