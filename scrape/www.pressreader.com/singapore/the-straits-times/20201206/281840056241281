    <p>The tai tais and their young male in­struc­tors shimmy, mask­less and close to­gether, their dance club a de­light­ful es­cape from a world rav­aged by a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Lit­tle did any­one sus­pect that some of them had caught – and were spread­ing – the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Now, Hong Kong is pay­ing for that lapse.</p>
    <p>The city’s dance clubs – known as play­grounds for its tai tais or ladies of leisure – are in the spot­light af­ter they were blamed for what Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam called an “ul­tra-large clus­ter” of Covid-19 in­fec­tions that sparked the fourth wave in the ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>More than 600 cases have so far been linked to the clus­ter, ac­count­ing for nearly 10 per cent of all in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Videos of these dance clubs cir­cu­lated widely on­line show dozens of mid­dle-aged women, in shim­mer­ing dresses or ruf­fled skirts, hair neatly coiffed and ear­rings gleam­ing un­der the rov­ing lights, keep­ing in step with their vis­i­bly younger male coun­ter­parts in tight shirts and fit­ted vests.</p>
    <p>Many of these men are paid hand­somely for their lessons and com­pany, with some even il­le­gally fer­ried into Hong Kong from main­land China, lo­cal me­dia said.</p>
    <p>Some of the in­struc­tors, who cover salsa, ball­room, tango and other clas­sic forms of dance, teach at mul­ti­ple stu­dios, with premises rented specif­i­cally to host such get-to­geth­ers, thereby fa­cil­i­tat­ing the spread of the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral mem­bers of Hong Kong’s high so­ci­ety have tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 as the lat­est wave throws the spot­light on their ex­clu­sive so­cial cir­cles.</p>
    <p>Bil­lion­aire Ros­sana Wang Gaw, 75, who chairs the listed prop­erty de­vel­op­ment firm Pioneer Global Group, fell ill af­ter vis­it­ing Starlight Dance Club in the Wan Chai district last month.</p>
    <p>Other well-known names linked to the clus­ter in­clude for­mer ac­tress Tse Ling-ling, 64, the ex-wife of Lai Sun De­vel­op­ment chair­man Peter Lam Kin-ngok; as well as Mr David Chiu Tat-cheong, 66, who owns Hong Kong Ca­ble Tele­vi­sion and chairs prop­erty con­glom­er­ate Far East Con­sor­tium, and his wife Nancy Chiu Ng Wai-ping, 64.</p>
    <p>Ms Tse has clar­i­fied that she was not part of the dance group but that she came into con­tact with an in­fected friend dur­ing a mahjong ses­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Chiu and his wife told the me­dia that they were di­ag­nosed af­ter a pri­vate din­ner at a friend’s home that in­cluded an in­fected per­son from the dance group.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal pa­pers have gone into over­drive with news of the coro­n­avirus wreak­ing havoc on the city’s rich and fa­mous.</p>
    <p>Some did not pass up the op­por­tu­nity to be sala­cious, high­light­ing in par­tic­u­lar the large age gap be­tween the women and their in­struc­tors, even go­ing so far to in­sin­u­ate im­pro­pri­ety be­tween them.</p>
    <p>The South China Morn­ing Post quoted a dance en­thu­si­ast, iden­ti­fied only as Mr Ip, 63, as say­ing: “When danc­ing with the teacher, fe­male dancers are treated like a princess on the stage.”</p>
    <p>He also claimed that some of his fe­male friends had hired speed­boat ser­vices to ferry dance teach­ers from Shen­zhen to Hong Kong, de­spite the clo­sure of the bor­der be­tween the two cities.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics say the tai tai dance clus­ter lays bare an un­com­fort­able truth: Many of Hong Kong’s rich peo­ple care lit­tle for the lives and well-be­ing of their less well-off com­pa­tri­ots.</p>
    <p>Ad­min­is­tra­tive as­sis­tant Elaine Lai, who is in her 30s, lives with her hus­band and two-year-old son just a few min­utes’ walk from the Wan Chai dance club.</p>
    <p>She said: “If they had any de­cency, they would have main­tained so­cial dis­tanc­ing, or at least put on masks.</p>
    <p>“We can­not af­ford to fall sick. If we stop work­ing, the food will stop com­ing in too and the land­lord will kick us out.”</p>
    <p>But there were oth­ers who were more for­giv­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms San­dra Wong, a cor­po­rate com­mu­ni­ca­tions direc­tor in her 40s, said: “Peo­ple can be in­con­sid­er­ate, whether they are rich or poor. In the case of the tai tais, they should have kept their masks on or post­poned their dance ac­tiv­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>She added: “But I also think that the own­ers of the venues should be pe­nalised as they shouldn’t have al­lowed such big gath­er­ings or let peo­ple go mask­less on their premises.”</p>
    <p>Most, how­ever, could not help but note that the premises were al­lowed to stay open for the elite to party, de­spite rules re­quir­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing and masks to be worn else­where.</p>
    <p>Many liveli­hoods and the econ­omy are bear­ing the brunt.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult of the new surge in cases, nightlife venues, mahjong par­lours and theme parks have once more been forced to shut, restau­rant dine-in hours and ca­pac­ity are lim­ited again, and pub­lic gath­er­ings are now re­stricted to two peo­ple.</p>
    <p>What would have been t he world’s first quar­an­tine-free travel bub­ble be­tween Hong Kong and</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore – an at­tempt at nor­mal­is­ing air travel – was halted due to the resur­gence of Covid-19 in the ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>Much of the blame may lie with the gov­ern­ment rather than any­one else, dance­s­port ath­lete Sam Ng sug­gested in a col­umn pub­lished on lo­cal news site Stand News.</p>
    <p>“Per­haps the fail­ure to con­tain the coro­n­avirus should not be blamed on the be­hav­iour of the Hong Kong peo­ple, but rather, gov­ern­ment pol­icy rife with l oop­holes,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Danc­ing isn’t a sin… So what if the age gap be­tween the dance part­ners is huge?</p>
    <p>“The el­derly woman who wants to dance may be wid­owed and un­able to find a part­ner. What’s so wrong with hir­ing a much younger in­struc­tor...</p>
    <p>“Must she re­ally take the trou­ble to find an ‘ap­pro­pri­ate’ 80-yearold dance teacher for her­self?”</p>
