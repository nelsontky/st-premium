    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Model and cook­book au­thor Chrissy Teigen said late on Wed­nes­day that she and her hus­band, mu­si­cian John Le­gend, had lost their baby, a son, days af­ter she posted on so­cial me­dia about suf­fer­ing preg­nancy com­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>“Driv­ing home from the hospi­tal with no baby,” Teigen wrote on Twit­ter. “How can this be real.”</p>
    <p>Teigen, 34, had been hos­pi­talised a few days ear­lier, and posted about a “scram­ble to hear the heart­beat”.</p>
    <p>In an emo­tional In­sta­gram post to her 31 mil­lion fol­low­ers, Teigen wrote on Wed­nes­day that de­spite many blood trans­fu­sions, her baby had not been able to get the flu­ids he needed.</p>
    <p>“We are shocked and in the kind of deep pain you only hear about, the kind of pain we’ve never felt be­fore,” she wrote.</p>
    <p>It was not clear how far along she was in the preg­nancy, but last month, Teigen ac­ci­den­tally let it slip that she was ex­pect­ing a baby boy. She and Le­gend are the par­ents of one daugh­ter, Luna, four, and a son, Miles, two.</p>
    <p>Teigen said in her post they had not de­cided on their other chil­dren’s names un­til just be­fore they left the hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>“But we, for some rea­son, had started to call this lit­tle guy in my belly Jack,” she wrote. “So he will al­ways be Jack to us.”</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, Le­gend, 41, wrote on Twit­ter “We love you, Jack”, fol­lowed by five black hearts.</p>
