    <p>Madam Siti Ha­jar, a 64-year-old re­tiree, vis­its Gey­lang East Pub­lic Li­brary twice a month to look up recipes and bak­ing cour­ses us­ing the com­put­ers there.</p>
    <p>She en­joys go­ing to the li­brary to use its dig­i­tal re­sources as the sole com­puter at home is of­ten used by her grown-up chil­dren, and there are am­bas­sadors in the li­brary whom she can turn to for help.</p>
    <p>Now, Madam Siti can also ac­cess pub­lic ser­vices – such as ap­ply­ing for the Com­mu­nity Health As­sist Scheme or mak­ing Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) nom­i­na­tions – at the pi­lot SG Dig­i­tal Of­fice at the Gey­lang East li­brary.</p>
    <p>Since the pi­lot started early last month, around 1,200 on­line trans­ac­tions with var­i­ous gov­ern­ment agen­cies have been made.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to the three self-ser­vice kiosks avail­able on the ground floor of the li­brary, se­niors who need help with more com­plex ser­vices can make ap­point­ments for vir­tual one-on-one con­sul­ta­tions via a video-con­fer­enc­ing pod.</p>
    <p>The pod is avail­able from 10am to noon ev­ery Wed­nes­day, with am­bas­sadors present to help se­niors with ser­vices which in­clude mak­ing ap­point­ments with gov­ern­ment agen­cies such as the CPF Board and Hous­ing Board.</p>
    <p>While all 25 pub­lic li­braries in Sin­ga­pore have dig­i­tal am­bas­sadors to help se­niors with ba­sic dig­i­tal skills, for in­stance, in us­ing mo­bile apps such as What­sApp and SingPass, Gey­lang East Pub­lic Li­brary is the only one which also of­fers them as­sis­tance for gov­ern­ment ser­vices.</p>
    <p>In­te­grat­ing the work of dif­fer­ent agen­cies will fur­ther boost dig­i­tal ser­vices and reach more seg­ments of the pop­u­la­tion, said Min­is­ter for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion S. Iswaran dur­ing a visit to the Gey­lang East Pub­lic Li­brary yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“About 50,000 se­niors have been reached through the Se­niors Go Dig­i­tal pro­gramme and the goal is to reach 100,000 se­niors by March next year. I think we’re on track but the key is to per­se­vere in the ef­fort and be con­sis­tent in the out­reach,” he added.</p>
    <p>The Se­niors Go Dig­i­tal pro­gramme was launched in June by the In­fo­comm Me­dia Devel­op­ment Au­thor­ity to help se­niors learn how to use e-pay­ment meth­ods us­ing apps or QR codes, with demon­stra­tions in pub­lic li­braries and com­mu­nity cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Mr Iswaran also told the me­dia that 5,400 se­niors have ben­e­fited from the Mo­bile Ac­cess for Se­niors pro­gramme, launched in July to help lower-in­come se­niors se­cure a de­vice and mo­bile plan by mak­ing these more af­ford­able.</p>
    <p>He added that 12,000 com­put­ers have been dis­trib­uted to low­in­come house­holds, and 5,000 fam­i­lies given free broad­band ac­cess this year, un­der the NEU PC Plus pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, to help se­niors learn how to use the li­brary’s ser­vices and e-re­sources, the Na­tional Li­brary Board will be launch­ing Li­brary Learn­ing Jour­neys at all 25 pub­lic li­braries from Fe­bru­ary next year.</p>
    <p>They will be led by dig­i­tal am­bas­sadors who will teach se­niors in classes of four on how to scan QR codes and ac­cess eNews­pa­pers. Each free ses­sion will last about an hour.</p>
