    <p>When he was a stu­dent at the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion (ITE), Mr Syazwan Hidir Mo­hammed Ja’afar, 22, re­alised he wanted a more peo­ple-cen­tric job.</p>
    <p>“My in­tern­ship at a food pro­cess­ing firm was more back-end. I re­alised I pre­fer some­thing in which I am at the front of things,” he says.</p>
    <p>This, cou­pled with his ex­pe­ri­ence of vol­un­teer­ing with char­i­ties dur­ing his time at ITE, helped him re­alise he wanted a job in which he could help peo­ple di­rectly.</p>
    <p>He set­tled on the idea of be­com­ing a phar­macy tech­ni­cian and is do­ing a diploma in phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal sci­ence at Repub­lic Polytech­nic (RP), which he en­tered through the Di­rect En­try Scheme to Polytech­nic Pro­gramme (DPP).</p>
    <p>“I have mod­ules like Pa­tient Care, which teaches me how to talk to and han­dle pa­tients,” he says.</p>
    <p>The DPP is a pro­gramme for Se­condary 4 “Nor­mal” aca­demic stu­dents. It al­lows them to first en­rol in a Higher Nitec (Na­tional ITE Cer­tifi­cate) course at ITE.</p>
    <p>On com­plet­ing that course with the ap­pro­pri­ate grades, stu­dents can move on im­me­di­ately to a polytech­nic course. “I’m grate­ful for the DPP be­cause it helped me save some time,” says Mr Syazwan.</p>
    <p>ITE stu­dents usu­ally have to com­plete a Nitec course be­fore do­ing the Higher Nitec course.</p>
    <p>But DPP stu­dents like Mr Syazwan are not re­quired to do the ini­tial two-year Nitec qual­i­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“There are some re­grets as I some­times think I could have got into polytech­nic through the joint ad­mis­sions ex­er­cise if I had cho­sen to carry on in se­condary school in­stead of go­ing to ITE. But I am also grate­ful to have been able to do my na­tional ser­vice be­fore go­ing on to poly,” he says.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing had time in NS to think about what I want to do helped me de­cide on my ca­reer choice.”</p>
