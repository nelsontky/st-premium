    <p>Amer­i­can ac­tress Bella Thorne (be­low) has re­port­edly earned more than US$2 mil­lion (S$2.7 mil­lion) since she started her ac­count on Lon­don-based con­tent sub­scrip­tion plat­form On­lyFans a week ago, ac­cord­ing to USA To­day. Her ac­count was so pop­u­lar that it caused the site to crash. Thorne is known for her roles in films such as ro­man­tic drama Midnight Sun (2018).</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can ac­tress Bella Thorne has re­port­edly earned more than US$2 mil­lion (S$2.74 mil­lion) since she started her ac­count on Lon­don­based con­tent sub­scrip­tion plat­form On­lyFans a week ago, USA To­day re­ported.</p>
    <p>The plat­form was launched in 2016 as a hub for in­flu­encers and celebri­ties to charge a sub­scrip­tion fee for pho­tos and videos.</p>
    <p>Thorne, 22, made a stag­ger­ing US$1 mil­lion in the first 24 hours alone, mak­ing her the first user to ever make that much money on their first day on the plat­form, ac­cord­ing to en­ter­tain­ment news out­let Page Six.</p>
    <p>Her ac­count was so pop­u­lar that it caused the site to crash. Thorne is known for her roles in films such as ro­man­tic drama Midnight Sun (2018) and crime thriller In­fa­mous (2020).</p>
    <p>On­lyFans has lately been a topic of much in­ter­est. The plat­form was ref­er­enced in singer Bey­once and rap­per Me­gan Thee Stal­lion’s em­pow­er­ing an­them Sav­age, and counts celebri­ties in­clud­ing rap­per Cardi B, model Blac Chyna and YouTu­ber Tana Mongeau as users.</p>
    <p>Like In­sta­gram, YouTube and Face­book, On­lyFans is a so­cial net­work­ing ser­vice. But un­like those plat­forms, On­lyFans al­lows NSFW (not safe for work) con­tent, in­clud­ing nu­dity and other ex­plicit ma­te­rial.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers pay a monthly fee to ac­cess con­tent from creators, who set their own monthly sub­scrip­tion price. Cardi, for in­stance, charges fans US$4.99, while Thorne of­fers ex­clu­sive con­tent for US$20.</p>
    <p>Be­sides celebri­ties, On­lyFans fea­tures other con­tent creators like fit­ness ex­perts and chefs.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Pa­per Mag­a­zine, Thorne had said on the plat­form: “On­lyFans is the first plat­form where I can fully con­trol my im­age; without cen­sor­ship, without judg­ment and without be­ing bul­lied on­line for be­ing me.”</p>
    <p>She will be us­ing her earn­ings from the plat­form for her pro­duc­tion com­pany and char­ity, she added.</p>
