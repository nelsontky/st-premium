    <p>A 13-year-old girl who fell to her death in Jan­uary at a multi-storey carpark was rid­ing her friend’s fixed-gear bi­cy­cle down a slope in the build­ing, po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed. Such bi­cy­cles gen­er­ally do not have hand­brakes.</p>
    <p>A girl who fell to her death in Jan­uary at a multi-storey carpark was rid­ing her friend’s fixed-gear bi­cy­cle down a slope in the build­ing, po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed.</p>
    <p>Such bi­cy­cles gen­er­ally do not have hand­brakes.</p>
    <p>The 13-year-old had only started to learn to ride a bi­cy­cle when she was in Pri­mary 6 and was still a novice at cy­cling, the state coro­ner was told yes­ter­day dur­ing an in­quiry into her death.</p>
    <p>The girl was found mo­tion­less on the ground level of the multi-storey carpark at Block 526A Pasir Ris Street 51 on the af­ter­noon of Jan 8. She was pro­nounced dead by paramedics at the scene.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese-lan­guage news­pa­per Shin Min Daily News re­ported that a do­mes­tic helper, who spot­ted the girl ly­ing at the foot of the build­ing af­ter hear­ing a loud noise, called the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force and the po­lice.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions showed that the girl and her class­mates had gone to the carpark af­ter school on the day</p>
    <p>of the in­ci­dent, As­sis­tant Su­per­in­ten­dent of Po­lice Gabriel Goh told the court.</p>
    <p>The girl watched her friends cy­cle on fixed-gear bi­cy­cles on the sixth and sev­enth lev­els of the multi-storey carpark and then tried do­ing so as well, he said.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed that a friend ac­com­pa­nied the girl on foot ini­tially as she was cy­cling, said ASP Goh.</p>
    <p>The friend said that the girl had trou­ble con­trol­ling the bi­cy­cle</p>
    <p>when she first got on it, he said.</p>
    <p>ASP Goh also said that the friend was un­able to keep up af­ter the girl be­gan cy­cling down the ramp from the sev­enth to the sixth level of the build­ing.</p>
    <p>While the friend asked the girl to turn right, she con­tin­ued to move straight to­wards the metal rail­ing at the side of the carpark and col­lided with it, he said.</p>
    <p>The court was told that she was flung out of the build­ing but grabbed the rail­ing “mo­men­tar­ily”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she could not main­tain her grip and fell to the ground, said ASP Goh.</p>
    <p>He said the girl suf­fered mul­ti­ple in­juries, in­clud­ing frac­tures to her skull and ribs.</p>
    <p>An au­topsy re­vealed that the pat­tern of her in­juries was con­sis­tent with those re­sult­ing from a fall from height, ASP Goh said.</p>
    <p>The in­quiry is ex­pected to con­tinue later this month.</p>
