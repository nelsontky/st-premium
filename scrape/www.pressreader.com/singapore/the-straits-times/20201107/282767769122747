    <p>PARIS • Diego Schwartz­man had de­signs on reach­ing next weekend’s sea­son-end­ing ATP Fi­nals for the first time.</p>
    <p>To book his berth in Lon­don, the world No. 9 had to beat Daniil Medvedev yes­ter­day or hope that Pablo Car­reno Busta failed in his at­tempt to win the Paris Masters – the Spa­niard’s quar­ter-fi­nal with sec­ond-ranked com­pa­triot Rafael Nadal was not over by press time.</p>
    <p>The Ar­gen­tinian, how­ever, could not get one over his bo­gey op­po­nent, suf­fer­ing his fourth de­feat in as many games as the fifthranke­d Rus­sian com­fort­ably won 6-3, 6-1 to move into the last four of the Paris Masters at the Bercy Arena to­day.</p>
    <p>Medvedev, who se­cured his place in Lon­don back in Septem­ber and will be mak­ing his sec­ond straight ap­pear­ance, took just 63 min­utes to beat Schwartz­man.</p>
    <p>By do­ing so, he will also over­take 20-time Grand Slam win­ner Roger Fed­erer of Switzer­land as world No. 4 on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The 24-year-old, who has two Masters 1000 ti­tles un­der his belt, has yet to win an ATP ti­tle this year. But hav­ing reached his sec­ond semi-fi­nal of the coro­n­avirus­dis­rupted sea­son, he is com­ing into form at the right time.</p>
    <p>Medvedev, whose seven ATP ti­tles have all come on hard courts, broke his op­po­nent’s serve in the third game and never looked back, while Schwartz­man never looked like mount­ing a come­back, win­ning just one of 28 points on Medvedev’s first serve.</p>
    <p>Claim­ing that he “kept his level high”, the 2019 US Open fi­nal­ist told re­porters: “It was a good match but Diego is ca­pa­ble of play­ing bet­ter. He did not show his best ten­nis... he did some er­rors, al­low­ing me to take con­trol. It was good for me that I man­aged to win in such a short time against some­one who serves well.</p>
    <p>“It’s good that I’ve went so far here al­ready. It’s good prepa­ra­tion for Lon­don. The con­di­tions are quite sim­i­lar, no spec­ta­tors un­for­tu­nately, it’s kind of dark.</p>
    <p>“With spec­ta­tors, the court is lit up. Here with no spec­ta­tors, it feels strange but I’m get­ting used to it and I’m show­ing some good ten­nis.</p>
    <p>“I pre­fer with spec­ta­tors be­cause it’s re­ally fun and the ten­nis court is a scene with ev­ery­one watch­ing, mak­ing in­door tour­na­ments re­ally cool.”</p>
    <p>Both the Paris Masters and the ATP Tour Fi­nals are be­ing held be­hind closed doors be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
