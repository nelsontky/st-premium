    <p>The dras­tic eco­nomic fall­out of the Covid-19 pan­demic has fast-tracked an on­go­ing In­dian gov­ern­ment ef­fort to dig­i­talise its food se­cu­rity sys­tem and in­tro­duce porta­bil­ity for its ben­e­fi­cia­ries.</p>
    <p>Launched as a pi­lot in Au­gust last year, the One Na­tion One Ra­tion Card (ONORC) scheme al­low­ing in­di­vid­u­als to re­ceive sub­sidised food ra­tions any­where in In­dia has re­ceived greater im­pe­tus as it could help the gov­ern­ment draw mi­grant work­ers back to cities and re­vive the coun­try’s econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The lock­down im­posed in March be­cause of the coro­n­avirus – cases of which surged past the two-mil­lion mark this week – had forced many daily wage work­ers to re­turn to their vil­lages as they found them­selves stranded in the cities with no means of earn­ing a liv­ing.</p>
    <p>ONORC al­lows its ben­e­fi­cia­ries to get their ra­tions from a fair-price shop any­where in In­dia by pro­vid­ing their ra­tion card num­ber and thumbprint or a scan of the iris, which are ver­i­fied against the coun­try’s na­tional Aad­haar data­base.</p>
    <p>Prior to this, ben­e­fi­cia­ries could re­ceive food ra­tions only where their cards were reg­is­tered.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Food and Pub­lic Dis­tri­bu­tion Ram Vi­las Paswan tweeted last Saturday that the ONORC net­work had been ex­panded to cover 24 states, a move that would ben­e­fit more than 650 mil­lion in­di­vid­u­als, in­clud­ing in­ter­state mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>Once all the states are linked to this scheme – of­fi­cially ex­pected by March 31 next year – it will cover more than 800 mil­lion peo­ple reg­is­tered un­der the world’s big­gest food se­cu­rity pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The 2013 Na­tional Food Se­cu­rity Act (NFSA) man­dates that the fed­eral gov­ern­ment sup­ply 5kg of food­grains per per­son each month, at heav­ily sub­sidised prices, to 75 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion in ru­ral ar­eas and 50 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion in ur­ban ar­eas – which works out to around 67 per cent of the to­tal pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>While the move to speed up porta­bil­ity has been widely wel­comed, there have been de­mands to uni­ver­salise ac­cess to sub­sidised food­grains as a tem­po­rary mea­sure, given the pro­longed eco­nomic down­turn as well as abun­dant stocks of food­grains in gov­ern­ment gra­naries.</p>
    <p>“There is an ur­gency to this is­sue be­cause there are so many field re­ports that in­di­cate food con­sump­tion has gone down among peo­ple,” said As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Dipa Sinha of the School of Lib­eral Stud­ies at Ambed­kar Univer­sity Delhi.</p>
    <p>She said the ONORC scheme is “ab­so­lutely not” a so­lu­tion to the cur­rent hunger cri­sis, although it is be­ing pushed as one. “Even if it works re­ally smoothly and ac­cord­ing to plan, it won’t be ready be­fore an­other year,” she said.</p>
    <p>There are also nu­mer­ous chal­lenges that the gov­ern­ment will have to over­come so that the ONORC sys­tem works ef­fec­tively. These in­clude en­sur­ing sup­ply net­works are able to re­spond to a sud­den in­crease in de­mand for food­grains at any one lo­ca­tion be­cause of an in­creased in­flux of mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Reetika Khera of the In­dian In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy Delhi told The Straits Times that the ONORC sys­tem could even en­able cor­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>A dealer in a city, for in­stance, could give a mi­grant worker only his in­di­vid­ual share of food­grains but may also record the share of his other fam­ily mem­bers back in the vil­lage in the trans­ac­tion, she said. “That kind of ob­fus­ca­tion and cheat­ing by the dealer is something that this tech­nol­ogy can en­able.”</p>
    <p>There also are con­cerns that mil­lions of po­ten­tial ben­e­fi­cia­ries re­main ex­cluded from the pub­lic dis­tri­bu­tion sys­tem, ac­cord­ing to an April study by Prof Khera and fel­low aca­demics Jean Dreze and Meghana Mungikar.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause the gov­ern­ment still uses the de­cen­nial 2011 Cen­sus pop­u­la­tion fig­ure of 1.21 bil­lion to cal­cu­late ben­e­fi­cia­ries cov­ered by the NFSA.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the pop­u­la­tion now stands at 1.37 bil­lion. A 67 per cent share of this amounts to 922 mil­lion, which means that over 100 mil­lion peo­ple en­ti­tled to food ra­tions are not get­ting them.</p>
    <p>Even reg­is­tered ben­e­fi­cia­ries have trou­ble ac­cess­ing ra­tions be­cause of un­re­li­able In­ter­net ac­cess in ru­ral ar­eas as well as in­stances when thumb im­pres­sions be­come un­read­able. Fin­ger­prints are known to fade be­cause of age and man­ual labour. More­over, se­niors or peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties are un­able to walk to the dis­tri­bu­tion sites to ver­ify their iden­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>“Porta­bil­ity will ride on Aad­haar, which, as we know, is a tool of ex­clu­sion, not in­clu­sion,” said Prof Khera. “The ONORC is the new avatar of the old Aad­haar men­ace.”</p>
    <p>There have been sug­ges­tions to in­stead adopt smart cards that would take away vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties that come from the use of bio­met­rics as well as the need for real-time In­ter­net ac­cess to con­duct trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>One Na­tion One Ra­tion Card al­lows its ben­e­fi­cia­ries to get their ra­tions from a fair-price shop any­where in In­dia by pro­vid­ing their ra­tion card num­ber and thumbprint or a scan of the iris, which are ver­i­fied against the coun­try’s na­tional Aad­haar data­base.</p>
