    <p>Pri­tam’s maiden speech as Leader of the Op­po­si­tion</p>
    <p>Work­ers’ Party (WP) chief Pri­tam Singh, who was ap­pointed Leader of the Op­po­si­tion af­ter his party won an un­prece­dented 10 seats in Par­lia­ment at the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion, used the longer time – 40 min­utes – he has been al­lo­cated to delve into the op­po­si­tion’s role in de­bat­ing poli­cies in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>In his 33-minute speech, Mr Singh said he and his WP col­leagues will have to work ex­tra hard. “We will have to ask our­selves tough ques­tions be­fore cri­tiquing govern­ment pol­icy, chief of which is what would we do if we were in charge.”</p>
    <p>But, he added, there must be clar­ity about “what the op­po­si­tion can and can­not do”. With 10 MPs, the WP falls far short of the re­sources avail­able to the Govern­ment, he said, and it is im­por­tant for Sin­ga­pore­ans to take this into ac­count when form­ing their ex­pec­ta­tions of the op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>While the WP will not form a shadow Cabi­net ow­ing to a lack of re­sources, he an­nounced that it will or­gan­ise it­self to scru­ti­nise poli­cies in five ar­eas im­por­tant to Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>They are: health, age­ing and re­tire­ment ad­e­quacy; jobs, busi­nesses and the econ­omy; ed­u­ca­tion, inequal­ity and the cost of liv­ing; hous­ing, trans­port and in­fra­struc­ture; and na­tional sus­tain­abil­ity, a broad area about how to en­sure Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to thrive far into the fu­ture for suc­ces­sive gen­er­a­tions.</p>
