    <p>BENGALURU US bank­ruptcy fil­ings fell last month to their low­est in more than 14 years, ac­cord­ing to data com­piled by Epiq Sys­tems and pro­vided by the Amer­i­can Bank­ruptcy In­sti­tute, a jar­ring dis­con­nect with the wors­en­ing eco­nomic out­look as Covid-19 cases surge.</p>
    <p>The 34,440 bank­ruptcy fil­ings of all types last month were the low­est monthly to­tal since Jan­uary 2006, driven by a de­cline in non­com­mer­cial fil­ings.</p>
    <p>“These his­toric low bank­ruptcy fil­ings re­flect the over­all un­cer­tainty about our eco­nomic re­cov­ery,” said Ms Deirdre O’Con­nor, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of cor­po­rate re­struc­tur­ing at Epiq.</p>
    <p>“Bank­ruptcy is a le­gal tool to re­struc­ture but in this un­known fi­nan­cial en­vi­ron­ment, the ben­e­fit from seek­ing bank­ruptcy pro­tec­tion is un­clear for in­di­vid­u­als, fam­i­lies, and even large com­pa­nies.”</p>
    <p>Still, fil­ings of the Chap­ter 11 bank­rupt­cies used by com­pa­nies to re­struc­ture their debts jumped 40 per cent to 654 last month, from 449 in Novem­ber 2019, the data shows.</p>
    <p>New cases of Covid-19 have surged in the United States in re­cent weeks, prompt­ing many peo­ple to stay at home more and some local au­thor­i­ties to shut some busi­nesses to con­tain the spread.</p>
    <p>But un­like in March when the first lock­downs were im­posed and threw the econ­omy into a sharp re­ces­sion, de­vel­op­ers of vac­cines are mov­ing closer to gov­ern­ment ap­provals. That po­ten­tially clears the way for the first in­oc­u­la­tions to start within weeks and mass dis­tri­bu­tion within months.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mists ex­pect a vac­cine roll­out to set the stage for faster eco­nomic growth next year.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment pro­grammes that have helped house­holds stave off bank­ruptcy, in­clud­ing evic­tion mora­to­ri­ums and ex­tended un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits, are slated to run out at the end of the year.</p>
    <p>Law­mak­ers in Wash­ing­ton have re­vived ne­go­ti­a­tions over a new pan­demic relief pack­age in re­cent days.</p>
