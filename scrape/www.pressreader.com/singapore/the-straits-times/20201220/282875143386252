    <p>The three-month an­niver­sary fell yes­ter­day. On Sept 19, Donny van de Beek marked his Manch­ester United de­but with a calm fin­ish against Crys­tal Palace. That re­mains it, the sum to­tal of United’s home league goals in open play.</p>
    <p>In three months since, Bruno Fer­nan­des has con­verted a cou­ple of penal­ties but a club who were long a by­word for at­tack­ing, en­ter­tain­ing foot­ball have not found the net in any other way against English op­po­si­tion at Old Traf­ford.</p>
    <p>United have been pro­lific on the road. They are the sea­son’s top away scor­ers, get­ting at least three goals ev­ery game. But, af­ter top­ping many a ta­ble over the years, they are bot­tom of one: no other team have fewer open-play home goals.</p>
    <p>United can ar­gue there are as­ter­isks at­tached to the statis­tic. They scored five times against last sea­son’s Cham­pi­ons League semi-fi­nal­ists RB Leipzig. They faced Tot­ten­ham with 10 men for an hour. Their last five vis­i­tors have in­cluded four of the big six, in Spurs, Chelsea, Arse­nal and Manch­ester City. They have had in­juries and sus­pen­sions.</p>
    <p>And yet their at­tack­ing im­po­tence hints at the fun­da­men­tal fail­ings of Sol­sk­jaerism. Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer has over­seen some thrilling counter-at­tack­ing, some bril­liantly in­ci­sive, high-paced breaks. Yet negate the counter-at­tack by de­fend­ing deep and in num­bers and his United lack an al­ter­na­tive ap­proach to break down teams, be­yond giv­ing the ball to Fer­nan­des and hop­ing a cat­a­lyst cre­ates some­thing.</p>
    <p>Op­po­nents have adapted their game plans to sti­fle United’s strengths. Chelsea and City se­cured stale­mates by sac­ri­fic­ing their own at­tack­ing in­tent to en­sure they did not leave space be­hind or ei­ther side of their defence.</p>
    <p>Palace pre­fer to de­fend deep and counter-at­tack any­way; so does Jose Mour­inho, while Mikel Arteta’s best re­sults with Arse­nal have come when he has adopted that ap­proach. Fu­ture vis­i­tors should be tempted to copy it.</p>
    <p>United’s re­turn of one goal from 43 open-play at­tempts in their last five home matches sug­gests con­ver­sion is a prob­lem. Yet delve deeper and too few of th­ese are good chances: penal­ties apart, they have recorded only two shots with an ex­pected goals value of over 0.13 at Old Traf­ford since the Palace game, and both were against West Bromwich Al­bion.</p>
    <p>In short, their chances are ac­tu­ally half-chances. Many of their shots are op­ti­mistic, long-range ef­forts.</p>
    <p>That re­flects upon a lack of cre­ativ­ity. Sol­sk­jaer of­ten part­ners Ne­manja Matic or Scott McTom­i­nay with Fred, rather than a more pro­gres­sive passer like van de Beek or Paul Pogba, who brought in­ven­tion and in­ci­sion against Sh­effield United on Thurs­day. But it also shows the team lack a pat­tern of play, a way of un­lock­ing packed de­fences.</p>
    <p>Fer­nan­des’ in­di­vid­ual in­spi­ra­tion was an an­swer last sea­son, when he had five league as­sists at Old Traf­ford af­ter his Jan­uary ar­rival. This sea­son, how­ever, his four as­sists have come away. There, United’s run­ners can be af­forded more room; it gives him more scope to pass.</p>
    <p>To­day, Marcelo Bielsa’s Leeds, with their at­tack­ing ap­proach and front-foot foot­ball, may be ideal op­po­nents for United. But, even if their wait for an open-play goal ends, the un­der­ly­ing is­sues will re­main.</p>
    <p>United have been pro­lific on the road. They are the sea­son’s top away scor­ers, get­ting at least three goals ev­ery game. But, af­ter top­ping many a ta­ble over the years, they are bot­tom of one: no other team have fewer open-play home goals.</p>
