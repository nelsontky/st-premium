    <p>•</p>
    <p>In­ter­pol has is­sued a “red no­tice” to ar­rest the fugi­tive Thai heir to the Red Bull bil­lions for his role in a fa­tal hit-and-run.</p>
    <p>The move by the in­ter­na­tional po­lice or­gan­i­sa­tion is the lat­est in the years-long saga sur­round­ing Vo­rayuth “Boss” Yoovid­hya who crashed his Fer­rari in 2012, killing a po­lice of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>The charges against Vo­rayuth, grand­son of Red Bull’s co-founder, were dropped in July – spark­ing pub­lic out­rage from Thais who saw it as an ex­am­ple of im­punity en­joyed by the king­dom’s elite.</p>
    <p>It spurred probes by var­i­ous gov­ern­ment agen­cies, in­clud­ing the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Of­fice, which last month an­nounced fresh charges against Vo­rayuth of reck­less driv­ing caus­ing death and co­caine use.</p>
    <p>Na­tional po­lice spokesman Kris­sana Pat­tanacharoe­n con­firmed yes­ter­day that a red no­tice – In­ter­pol’s most ur­gent alert – was is­sued ear­lier last week.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter we re­ceived the con­fir­ma­tion, we then passed our re­quest to 194 mem­ber coun­tries, ask­ing for as­sis­tance from them,” he told Agence France-Presse. “We have to do what­ever it takes to... ul­ti­mately bring him back to the coun­try be­cause it is a se­ri­ous crime.”</p>
    <p>A red no­tice for Vo­rayuth had not been pub­lished on the In­ter­pol web­site as at yes­ter­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>The fugi­tive heir fled the coun­try back in 2017 on a pri­vate jet.</p>
    <p>Af­ter charges against him were dropped in July, a probe by Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha’s of­fice con­cluded that the en­tire in­ves­ti­ga­tion had been “com­pro­mised”.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic out­cry over Vo­rayuth came at a par­tic­u­larly tense pe­riod for the gov­ern­ment, co­in­cid­ing with near-daily protests across Thai­land led by pro-democ­racy stu­dent lead­ers call­ing for Mr Prayut’s res­ig­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Protesters have car­ried card­board cut-outs of Red Bull’s logo to sym­bol­ise their anger at the mil­i­tary-aligned gov­ern­ment, which en­joys close al­liances with the king­dom’s bil­lion­aire fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>The clan of Red Bull co-founder Cha­leo Yoovid­hya is Thai­land’s sec­ond rich­est fam­ily, boast­ing a for­tune es­ti­mated at US$20.2 bil­lion (S$27.6 bil­lion) ac­cord­ing to Forbes.</p>
