    <p>Asean for­eign min­is­ters urged self-re­straint and non-mil­i­tari­sa­tion in the South China Sea in a joint com­mu­nique that came at the end of their an­nual meet­ing, with sev­eral ex­press­ing con­cerns about the “land recla­ma­tions, ac­tiv­i­ties, and se­ri­ous in­ci­dents in the area”.</p>
    <p>Such ac­tiv­i­ties eroded trust and con­fi­dence and in­creased ten­sions, they said.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ters also high­lighted the need to pur­sue peace­ful res­o­lu­tion of dis­putes in ac­cor­dance with in­ter­na­tional law, in­clud­ing the 1982 United Na­tions Con­ven­tion on the Law of the Sea – with the United States later giv­ing the as­sur­ance that it stood along­side Asean in stand­ing up for the rule of law.</p>
    <p>The com­mu­nique, which did not re­fer to ei­ther China or the US, was re­leased a day af­ter the 53rd Asean For­eign Min­is­ters’ Meet­ing ended, one of sev­eral an­nual re­gional gath­er­ings last week that took place vir­tu­ally ow­ing to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>China’s ter­ri­to­rial claims, which span al­most the en­tirety of the South China Sea and clash with those of Asean coun­tries Viet­nam, the Philip­pines, Brunei and Malaysia, were re­jected as il­le­gal by an in­ter­na­tional ar­bi­tral tri­bunal in 2016, a rul­ing which the US ex­plic­itly sided with for the first time in July this year.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo em­pha­sised the “en­dur­ing US com­mit­ment to Asean”, in cham­pi­oning the rule of law, respect for sovereignt­y, as well as trans­parency in the South China Sea and Mekong re­gion.</p>
    <p>“We stand with our Asean part­ners as we in­sist on the rule of law and respect for sovereignt­y in the South China Sea, where Bei­jing has pur­sued ag­gres­sive cam­paigns of co­er­cion and en­vi­ron­men­tal dev­as­ta­tion,” he said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions be­tween the US and China have es­ca­lated sharply in re­cent months, over a wide range of is­sues in­clud­ing es­pi­onage, Chi­nese social me­dia apps, a na­tional se­cu­rity law for Hong Kong and China’s mil­i­tary build-up in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>Last month, the US an­nounced sanc­tions on 24 Chi­nese sta­te­owned en­ter­prises linked to the build­ing and mil­i­taris­ing of out­posts on ar­ti­fi­cial is­lands in the South China Sea. China re­sponded by fir­ing a se­ries of mis­siles into the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the US-Asean For­eign Min­is­ters’ Meet­ing on Thurs­day, Mr Pom­peo urged Asean to re­con­sider business deal­ings with Chi­nese en­ter­prises “that bully Asean coastal states in the South China Sea”.</p>
    <p>He also said Wash­ing­ton is deeply con­cerned about 12 Hong Kong democ­racy ac­tivists who have been de­tained in China, not­ing that they have been de­nied ac­cess to lawyers.</p>
    <p>“We also re­it­er­ate that the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party’s im­po­si­tion of dra­co­nian na­tional se­cu­rity leg­is­la­tion has oblit­er­ated Hong Kong’s au­ton­omy,” he said, re­fer­ring to the Chi­nese law which tar­gets acts deemed to be se­ces­sion­ist, sub­ver­sive, ter­ror­ism or for­eign col­lu­sion.</p>
    <p>He also said the US plans to co­host with Viet­nam the third In­doPa­cific Business Fo­rum, which aims to fos­ter mil­lions of dol­lars in US in­vest­ment. Wash­ing­ton will also pro­vide US$5 mil­lion (S$6.8 mil­lion) for skills train­ing un­der a Young South-east Asian Lead­ers Ini­tia­tive Acad­emy in Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>Re­gional watch­ers said the ap­peal to boy­cott cer­tain Chi­nese firms was un­likely to be well re­ceived by Asean coun­tries, which are gen­er­ally wary of be­ing drawn into great-power com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>China’s For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi on Wednesday told the Asean min­is­ters that the US was in­ter­fer­ing in the South China Sea and was driv­ing its mil­i­tari­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Pom­peo also sin­gled out North Korea and Myan­mar as chal­lenges fac­ing the re­gion. He urged North Korea to end provo­ca­tions and en­gage in sus­tained ne­go­ti­a­tions to achieve com­plete de­nu­cle­ari­sa­tion, and ex­pressed con­cerns over the con­tin­ued vi­o­lence in Myan­mar’s Rakhine state.</p>
    <p>MANILA • Philip­pine Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte has urged a peace­ful way out of con­flicts with China over the South China Sea and said in­ter­na­tional l aw must be fol­lowed, amid in­creased re­gional fric­tion over mil­i­tary ac­tiv­i­ties by Bei­jing and Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte made the re­marks in a meet­ing with vis­it­ing Chi­nese De­fence Min­is­ter Wei Fenghe, whose tour of four South-east Asian coun­tries co­in­cides with some rhetor­i­cal spar­ring be­tween the United States and China over the dis­puted wa­ter­way.</p>
    <p>“We must al­ways be guided by our com­mit­ments in in­ter­na­tional law. Any and all dis­putes must be re­solved peace­fully,” Mr Duterte said in a state­ment on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines, par­tic­u­larly its mil­i­tary, has a deep mis­trust of China over what it sees as in­tru­sions into its ter­ri­tory, bul­ly­ing of its fish­er­men and de­nial of ac­cess to its en­ergy re­sources.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam and Malaysia have made similar com­plaints this year. China main­tains its ac­tiv­i­ties are law­ful, be­cause they are in its wa­ters.</p>
    <p>Ties have im­proved some­what ow­ing to Mr Duterte’s court­ing of and praise for the Chi­nese lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>Gen­eral Wei, who has also vis­ited In­done­sia, Malaysia and Brunei, had ear­lier met Philip­pine De­fence Sec­re­tary Delfin Loren­zana, an out­spo­ken critic of China’s mar­itime con­duct.</p>
    <p>A De­fence Min­istry state­ment sum­maris­ing the meet­ing said Mr Loren­zana and Gen Wei com­mit­ted to re­solve dis­putes am­i­ca­bly and ad­vance mu­tual trust and in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>How­ever, that state­ment con­trasted sharply from one that was is­sued ear­lier and later re­tracted, which said Mr Loren­zana had told Gen Wei that any ac­tiv­i­ties in­fring­ing on Philip­pine mar­itime ter­ri­tory would be chal­lenged by its navy.</p>
    <p>Mr Loren­zana said the Philip­pines would pa­trol its wa­ters, ac­cord­ing to the re­tracted state­ment, which re­ferred to a 2016 ar­bi­tra­tion rul­ing on the South China Sea that Mr Loren­zana had told Gen Wei would be ad­hered to “with­out any pos­si­bil­ity of com­pro­mise or change”.</p>
    <p>FOLLOW IN­TER­NA­TIONAL LAW</p>
    <p>We must al­ways be guided by our com­mit­ments in in­ter­na­tional law. Any and all dis­putes must be re­solved peace­fully.</p>
    <p>PHILIP­PINE PRES­I­DENT RO­DRIGO DUTERTE</p>
    <p>The ar­bi­tra­tion case is highly sen­si­tive to China be­cause the tri­bunal in­val­i­dated its claim of his­toric ju­ris­dic­tion over nearly the en­tire South China Sea.</p>
