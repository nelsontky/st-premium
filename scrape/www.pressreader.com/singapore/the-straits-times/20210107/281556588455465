    <p>In 2016, United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump won Ge­or­gia by 5.1 points. Two years later,</p>
    <p>Repub­li­can Brian Kemp beat Demo­crat Stacey Abrams in the state’s gover­nor race, but with a shrunken mar­gin of 1.4 points. Last year, Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den flipped Ge­or­gia, de­feat­ing Mr Trump with a nar­row mar­gin of 0.2 point.</p>
    <p>The Democrats’ vic­tory in at least one of Ge­or­gia’s two Se­nate races – with the sec­ond one look­ing in­creas­ingly likely as well – un­der­scores how the elec­torate in the state has been trans­formed in re­cent years by a surge in young and mi­nor­ity vot­ers.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal or­gan­is­ers, many of them black women – with Ms Abrams the most high-profile among them – have re­lent­lessly worked for years to in­crease voter regis­tra­tion among black, Asian and Latino vot­ers, an ef­fort that bore fruit on Nov 3 with Mr Bi­den’s vic­tory and also on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>At the same time, while the Deep South state’s blue shift did not start with Mr Trump, it ap­pears to have been has­tened by him.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can de­feat in Ge­or­gia also sig­nals a re­jec­tion of Mr Trump’s fo­cus on un­der­min­ing Amer­ica’s demo­cratic in­sti­tu­tions with base­less claims of elec­toral fraud and con­spir­acy the­o­ries, while pay­ing less at­ten­tion to the Covid-19 pan­demic and vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal watch­ers noted that the Repub­li­can can­di­dates, in­cum­bent sen­a­tors David Per­due and Kelly Lo­ef­fler, had been ahead in close Se­nate races in Novem­ber that trig­gered the run-offs.</p>
    <p>They at­trib­uted the turn­around to Mr Trump, who per­son­ally cam­paigned in the state and spent the pe­riod be­tween Nov 3 and Jan 5 at­tack­ing Repub­li­cans who did not back his claims of fraud.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Se­nate ma­jor­ity leader</p>
    <p>Mitch McCon­nell ac­knowl­edged Mr Bi­den’s vic­tory, Mr Trump went against him and the Repub­li­can Party’s po­si­tion, to call for Covid-19 stim­u­lus cheques amount­ing to US$2,000 (S$2,600) for house­holds. He has sim­i­larly be­rated Repub­li­can of­fi­cials in Ge­or­gia who have main­tained that the state’s elec­tions were free and fair.</p>
    <p>“We don’t learn lessons very well, but what a po­lit­i­cal disas­ter Don­ald Trump is. Cost us the House, loses the White House by a big mar­gin, and now cost Repub­li­cans the Se­nate. Maybe not the kind of guy to keep build­ing the party around,” con­ser­va­tive pun­dit Bren­dan Buck, an aide to two former Repub­li­can House Speak­ers Paul Ryan and John Boehner, wrote on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>“Sub­urbs, my friends, the sub­urbs,” Mr Josh Holmes, the former chief of staff to Mr McCon­nell, wrote on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>“We went from talk­ing about jobs and the econ­omy to QAnon elec­tion con­spir­a­cies in four short years and – as it turns out – they were lis­ten­ing!”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s in­com­ing chief of staff Ron Klain also slammed Repub­li­can ef­forts yes­ter­day to ob­ject to Mr Bi­den’s vic­tory in Congress. Both the de­feated Repub­li­cans in Ge­or­gia said they would back those ef­forts.</p>
    <p>“It may be that telling vot­ers that you in­tend to ig­nore their ver­dict and over­turn their votes from the Novem­ber elec­tion was NOT a great clos­ing ar­gu­ment,” Mr Klain wrote on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Ge­or­gia elec­tions of­fi­cial Gabriel Ster­ling, a life­long Repub­li­can who has come un­der fire from the Pres­i­dent and re­ceived death threats for re­fus­ing to back Mr Trump’s claims of elec­toral fraud, sim­i­larly placed the blame for the Repub­li­cans’ re­ver­sal of for­tune squarely on Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>“When you tell peo­ple your vote didn’t count... you un­der­mine peo­ple’s con­fi­dence in the vote.</p>
    <p>Then you cre­ate a civil war within the GOP (Repub­li­can Party) at a time when the GOP prob­a­bly wanted to unite their vote to turn out. Those are the kinds of things the Pres­i­dent is solely re­spon­si­ble for do­ing,” he told CNN yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Ster­ling added: “While (Mr Trump) may in­spire peo­ple on the Repub­li­can side, he re­ally pisses off peo­ple on the Demo­cratic side, and re­ally in­spires them to come out and vote. When you can have a cred­i­ble vil­lain, that re­ally helps the Democrats turn out their vote.”</p>
