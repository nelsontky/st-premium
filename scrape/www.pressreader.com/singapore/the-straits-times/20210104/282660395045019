    <p>Barely three months into motherhood, Jil­lian Kim­berly Lim is plagued by mum-guilt.</p>
    <p>“It’s a real thing women place upon them­selves,” says the Kiss92 FM DJ, who gave birth to her first child, Lily In­die Meals, on Oct 29 last year.</p>
    <p>Lim, 30, knew that breast­feed­ing was the bet­ter choice for her baby, but came to the painful de­ci­sion to stop that.</p>
    <p>“I was con­stantly get­ting sick from breast­feed­ing and was un­able to take care of the baby.”</p>
    <p>It was also dif­fi­cult cop­ing with her new­born when she had colic.</p>
    <p>“The in­con­solable cry­ing for hours was ter­ri­fy­ing and ex­haust­ing,” she re­calls.</p>
    <p>It made her con­vinced that she needs a vil­lage to raise a child and that it is okay to seek help, she says.</p>
    <p>“My neigh­bours of­fered to help with her and I gladly ac­cepted.”</p>
    <p>Asked about her New Year’s res­o­lu­tion, Lim says: “To be eas­ier on my part­ner. He’s a very hands-on father, but his way of do­ing things isn’t my first choice.”</p>
    <p>Lim is mar­ried to Kenneth Christo­pher Meals, 31, who owns a bar­ber shop.</p>
    <p>“I need to step back and let him do it his way. At the end of the day, if it works and the child is happy, who cares how it’s done. Right?”</p>
    <p>With the Covid-19 travel re­stric­tions, it has been al­most a year since UFM100.3 DJ Lee Xinying’s par­ents saw their new grand­daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>Her Malaysian par­ents live across the Cause­way and have been in con­tact through video calls.</p>
    <p>Lee, 36, and her sales man­ager-hus­band Robin Leow, 35, wel­comed their daugh­ter, YC, on Jan 22 last year.</p>
    <p>Those early days when YC was al­ways “mak­ing a huge fuss and cry­ing” are long gone and she is now a happy, cu­ri­ous and dis­tracted baby.</p>
    <p>“I want to spend more time read­ing with her, but she would be grab­bing the books, re­sult­ing in many un­fin­ished sto­ries,” Lee says with a laugh.</p>
    <p>The first-time mum says she has not fully re­cov­ered from child­birth and is still suf­fer­ing from post­par­tum pelvic gir­dle pain.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore I had my child, I was told that the day af­ter a nat­u­ral birth, I’d be able to walk freely as usual, but that was not the case for me,” she says.</p>
    <p>For months, mov­ing her legs was dif­fi­cult and painful, af­fect­ing her daily move­ments. Till to­day, it still hurts when she takes long walks or car­ries YC for long pe­ri­ods. But the pain is worth it.</p>
    <p>She says: “The mo­ment I held her in my arms, my life was changed for­ever as this child has be­come a piece of my heart.”</p>
