    <p>The grue­some be­head­ing of a teacher over con­tro­ver­sial cartoons led to a strong re­sponse from the French gov­ern­ment. Global af­fairs cor­re­spon­dent Jonathan Eyal (be­low) says France needs to also ad­dress deep-rooted ques­tions about na­tional val­ues and its Mus­lim com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>LON­DON • How do you up­hold the val­ues of an open so­ci­ety? By mak­ing sure you do not of­fend any­one or in­stead, by tol­er­at­ing any­one who may of­fend you?</p>
    <p>The an­swer is never easy. Still, this is pre­cisely the ques­tion the teach­ers of France will have to grap­ple with a week from to­day, as a new French school year be­gins. For they will have to stand in as­sem­blies and be­fore their class­rooms to ex­plain the lessons which can be drawn from a hor­ri­ble crime which has shocked the en­tire French na­tion: the be­head­ing of a teacher who showed con­tro­ver­sial cartoons of the Prophet Muham­mad to his pupils dur­ing a reg­u­lar class about their civic du­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Samuel Paty, the teacher in ques­tion, warned his stu­dents be­fore­hand that what they were about to see could of­fend them, and al­lowed those who wished to ex­cuse them­selves from this ex­pe­ri­ence to leave the class­room. Still, hate mes­sages against him quickly started to cir­cu­late, and he was hunted down.</p>
    <p>His mur­derer was an 18-year-old eth­nic Chechen Mus­lim born in Rus­sia who came to France as a child refugee and did not at­tend the school at which Mr Paty taught. In­deed, he had no idea who the teacher was and had to pay ac­com­plices to iden­tify his in­tended vic­tim.</p>
    <p>This sense­less, grue­some crime shook France to the core. The late Mr Paty was awarded the Le­gion of Hon­our, France’s high­est or­der. A black-and-white pic­ture of his face, ev­i­dently taken in hap­pier days while he was on a hol­i­day, flut­tered from big posters through­out France.</p>
    <p>And at the of­fi­cial farewell cer­e­mony to the vic­tim, Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron and his en­tire Cab­i­net bowed be­fore the cas­ket, while the strains of the French na­tional an­them echoed in the cen­tre of Paris and the words “Lib­erty, Equal­ity, Fra­ter­nity” – the of­fi­cial motto of the French Repub­lic – were pro­jected over the build­ings of the Sor­bonne, the heart of France’s aca­demic life for the past eight cen­turies.</p>
    <p>The mes­sage was clear: This was no mere fu­neral, but a show of de­fi­ance and a ral­ly­ing war cry from a na­tion un­der siege. “He was killed pre­cisely be­cause he in­car­nated the Repub­lic,” a vis­i­bly moved Pres­i­dent Macron said dur­ing his fu­neral ora­tion for Mr Paty. “He was killed be­cause the Is­lamists want our fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>“They will never have it,” he vowed. “France will not give up our cartoons.”</p>
    <p>And true to form, the French state struck back, hard. Or­gan­i­sa­tions deemed to pro­mote what the au­thor­i­ties claim to be an in­tol­er­ant view of Is­lam were raided by the po­lice, and some were shut down by French In­te­rior Min­is­ter Ger­ald Dar­manin, who openly ad­mit­ted that his ob­jec­tive is “to ha­rass and desta­bilise” those he called the “en­e­mies of the Repub­lic”.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, Mr Macron has now promised to push ahead with a broader and much more con­tro­ver­sial plan to com­bat “this evil that is rad­i­cal Is­lam” by “free­ing” the faith in France – as he put it – from “ex­trem­ist for­eign in­flu­ences”.</p>
    <p>The sheer hor­ror felt by or­di­nary French cit­i­zens at what is hap­pen­ing to their coun­try is un­der­stand­able. Most of them know that cartoons lam­poon­ing the Prophet are deemed of­fen­sive by large numbers of Mus­lims. And only around 40,000 French­men and women read Charlie Hebdo, the satir­i­cal weekly which ini­tially pub­lished the of­fend­ing cartoons. But the idea that this pub­li­ca­tion has di­rectly prompted no fewer than four sep­a­rate ter­ror­ist at­tacks over the past five years, or that some­one can face be­head­ing in France for dis­play­ing some cartoons, is clearly shock­ing.</p>
    <p>Still, the poli­cies which Mr Macron is propos­ing to in­tro­duce in France are un­likely to ad­dress this prob­lem. For emo­tion is never a good coun­sel­lor, and panic re­ac­tion sel­dom leads to good pol­icy.</p>
    <p>There isn’t a sin­gle ex­pla­na­tion as to why France con­tin­ues to re­act in such a vis­ceral way to such crimes, or why France’s re­la­tions with its Mus­lim com­mu­nity are far more tense than those of other Euro­pean coun­tries.</p>
    <p>FRENCH MUS­LIM COM­MU­NITY</p>
    <p>One fac­tor is the sheer size of its Mus­lim com­mu­nity which, at around 9 per cent of France’s to­tal 67 mil­lion in­hab­i­tants, is the high­est in Europe, al­most dou­ble the cor­re­spond­ing per­cent­age in Bri­tain and a quar­ter higher than the share of Mus­lims in Ger­many.</p>
    <p>This does not make the French ei­ther racist or anti-Is­lamic. In fact, as a pan-Euro­pean poll last year by the Pew Re­search Cen­tre – a United States-based think-tank – re­vealed, 85 per cent of the peo­ple of France claim to have no prob­lem hav­ing Mus­lims as their neigh­bours and a sim­i­lar amount in­ter­act with Mus­lims on a daily ba­sis, the high­est such fig­ure for Europe.</p>
    <p>Still, a larger share of France’s Mus­lims lives in ef­fec­tively seg­re­gated ur­ban com­mu­ni­ties than any­where else in Europe. And the in­ci­dence of petty crime – as well as wealth dis­par­i­ties – in such com­mu­ni­ties is higher than fig­ures recorded in com­pa­ra­ble com­mu­ni­ties and de­prived res­i­den­tial areas in other Euro­pean states.</p>
    <p>As French writer and teacher</p>
    <p>Cloe Kor­man pointed out soon af­ter the lat­est mur­der, the idea that French schools in poor neigh­bour­hoods are or can be an oa­sis of calm and open de­bate is sim­ply a myth. “For poor stu­dents from work­ing-class neigh­bour­hoods, the pos­si­bil­ity of expressing them­selves is per­ma­nently de­nied. They are phys­i­cally scorned in these places of bru­tal­ity and noise, lack of care and hy­giene, that are their schools,” she wrote.</p>
    <p>Noth­ing, of course, jus­ti­fies mur­der, but nei­ther should some of the con­tribut­ing fac­tors to the cur­rent dis­as­ter be ig­nored.</p>
    <p>Yet, prob­a­bly the big­gest dif­fer­ence is that for most French­men and women, theirs is not merely a coun­try and a na­tion, but a com­mu­nity of val­ues which are pre-deter­mined and not sub­ject to com­pro­mise.</p>
    <p>THE VAL­UES OF LA REPUBLIQUE</p>
    <p>The con­cept of “la Republique” as a frag­ile in­sti­tu­tion which needs to be de­fended con­stantly is deeply in­grained; all the speeches of French pres­i­dents in­vari­ably end with the tra­di­tional cry of “Long Live the Repub­lic”, and as Mr Macron put it, the slain teacher, Mr Paty, was a ser­vant of the Repub­lic who died for its cause. No other Euro­pean coun­try en­gages in such a strange cult of val­ues.</p>
    <p>And one of the key pil­lars of French iden­tity, as the cur­rent French Con­sti­tu­tion adopted in 1958 puts it, is that “France shall be an in­di­vis­i­ble, sec­u­lar, demo­cratic and so­cial Repub­lic”.</p>
    <p>Yet, the word “sec­u­lar” does not truly con­vey the mean­ing of the word laique in French, which the Con­sti­tu­tion uses. For the word is cen­tral to the at­ti­tude of the French state and the French peo­ple to­wards re­li­gion, and it means more than just the sep­a­ra­tion of re­li­gion from the state; it also now im­plies a rel­e­ga­tion of re­li­gion to a sphere out­side pol­i­tics al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>In ef­fect, the French Repub­lic “pri­va­tised” re­li­gion; faith is some­thing peo­ple prac­tise in pri­vate, and the def­i­ni­tion of the di­vid­ing line between what con­sti­tutes the public and the pri­vate spheres re­mains a pre­rog­a­tive solely of the state. It is un­der this def­i­ni­tion that French law for­bids any­one from de­fam­ing oth­ers, call­ing for racial or anti-Semitic ha­tred, or deny­ing the Holo­caust. But blas­phemy, the act of show­ing con­tempt for re­li­gious ideas or sa­cred ob­jects, is not a crime, nor are re­li­gious car­i­ca­tures.</p>
    <p>It was ob­vi­ous for decades that these ar­range­ments jarred with many of France’s Mus­lims. Yet, in­stead of find­ing com­pro­mises, French politi­cians tight­ened the le­gal obli­ga­tions im­posed by their sec­u­lar state.</p>
    <p>TOP-DOWN AP­PROACH</p>
    <p>Mr Macron now pro­poses to tighten them even fur­ther, by re­strict­ing the for­eign fund­ing of mosques, and as­sign­ing to the French state the ed­u­ca­tion of imams to act as preach­ers for the Mus­lim com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Ar­guably, some of these steps are long over­due: There is no rea­son why Turkey or Saudi Ara­bia should be al­lowed to fi­nance mosques in France and im­pose their in­ter­pre­ta­tion of Is­lam on France’s Mus­lim com­mu­ni­ties who over­whelm­ingly hail from North Africa.</p>
    <p>But it is fan­ci­ful to as­sume that of­fi­cially ap­proved imams will gain cred­i­bil­ity with com­mu­ni­ties which re­main sus­pi­cious of the state. And it is equally fan­ci­ful to be­lieve that tol­er­a­tion can be or­dered from above.</p>
    <p>What is needed is a pro­gramme of in­te­gra­tion that seeks to clear out the slums in which many marginalis­ed Mus­lims live, an agenda which will be hugely ex­pen­sive and could take decades to put in place.</p>
    <p>Still, this is the only way by which France could nav­i­gate its poli­cies between its ex­treme-right politi­cians who see Is­lam as a breed­ing ground for vi­o­lence and its left-wing politi­cians who con­sider Is­lam as a re­li­gion of the op­pressed.</p>
    <p>And this could only hap­pen when all French politi­cians ac­cept that their cri­sis is not only about the place of Is­lam, but also about how much a Euro­pean na­tion must it­self change in or­der to ac­com­mo­date a more di­verse com­po­si­tion, and how much it should ac­knowl­edge that views of re­li­gion as es­sen­tially “yes­ter­day’s story” are not shared by more pi­ous cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>For as Pro­fes­sor Fran­cois Du­bet, one of France’s lead­ing so­ci­ol­o­gists, wrote over the past few days, the cur­rent “war-like pos­tures” which French politi­cians are adopt­ing merely ig­nore “those who want to both live in the coun­try where they were born, a coun­try in which their par­ents were of­ten born, but one in which we nev­er­the­less con­tinue to des­ig­nate them as im­mi­grants”.</p>
    <p>The bulk of these law-abid­ing French Mus­lims, writes Prof Du­bet, “are nei­ther the cause of our mis­for­tunes, nor mere silent vic­tims”; they are peo­ple who must be ex­pected both to re­spect ex­ist­ing in­sti­tu­tions, and also re­fash­ion them.</p>
