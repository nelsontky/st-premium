    <p>It’s been a very long wait for the thou­sands, in fact, 34,000 pref­er­ence shares and per­pet­ual se­cu­ri­ties (P&P), and bond hold­ers of Hyflux to see light at the end of the tun­nel. It has been some 2 1/2 years since Hyflux filed for pro­tec­tion in the Sin­ga­pore courts. It has now been placed un­der ju­di­cial man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>While some cred­i­tors have wel­comed the court’s de­ci­sion be­cause they are tired of wait­ing for Hyflux to find a suit­able white knight, many re­tail in­vestors fear the worst – liq­ui­da­tion. One can’t blame them as ju­di­cial man­age­ment of­ten leads to liq­ui­da­tion, leav­ing the sub­or­di­nated cred­i­tors com­pletely out of money.</p>
    <p>The se­nior cred­i­tors or the un­se­cured work­ing group (UWG), who were ad­vised by fi­nan­cial ad­vis­ers Bor­relli Walsh, had pre­vi­ously stated in a let­ter on Oct 15 last year, that they would ac­cept only an of­fer of 12.5 cents from any in­vestor to con­tinue to sup­port the re­struc­tur­ing. Such a de­mand would leave other cred­i­tors, par­tic­u­larly the P&P hold­ers who are sub­or­di­nated, with lit­tle or no re­turn. It is the hope of the Se­cu­ri­ties In­vestors As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore) or SIAS that a white knight can be found who will sat­isfy the se­nior cred­i­tors and also al­low the P&P hold­ers some re­turns.</p>
    <p>I have seen the tears and the heartache of the small in­vestors, who have ploughed their sav­ings into Hyflux. A large num­ber are re­tirees. Now, they look to the court-ap­pointed ju­di­cial man­agers to carry out the re­struc­tur­ing and pro­vide them with some re­turns. It is the last straw they are hang­ing on to.</p>
    <p>A fund has shown keen in­ter­est in tak­ing over Hyflux and has pro­vided a con­di­tional and non-bind­ing of­fer to all classes of Hyflux in­vestors. Time is of the essence and we urge the ju­di­cial man­agers to se­cure a bind­ing of­fer from this of­feror ur­gently.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, some cred­i­tors are con­sid­er­ing tak­ing le­gal ac­tion against the board. How­ever, that must be con­sid­ered a sep­a­rate mat­ter sub­ject to ob­tain­ing in­de­pen­dent le­gal opin­ion. Com­menc­ing le­gal ac­tion against the board will likely be costly and long drawn-out, and cred­i­tors should be pre­pared to in­cur sig­nif­i­cant time and re­sources in pur­su­ing and main­tain­ing such ac­tion.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions against the board are on­go­ing and if these in­ves­ti­ga­tions show cause to pur­sue an ac­tion against Hyflux’s board, SIAS will put its weight be­hind such an ac­tion. SIAS hopes that the ju­di­cial man­agers will con­sider the plight of the P&P hold­ers and act in the in­ter­ests of all cred­i­tors.</p>
    <p>We are hop­ing for a deal that in­cludes some form of re­cov­ery for all par­ties, to be reached for the sake of the thou­sands of dis­tressed small in­vestors.</p>
