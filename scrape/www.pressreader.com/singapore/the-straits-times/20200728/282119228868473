    <p>Re­trench­ing staff is one of the most chal­leng­ing tasks that man­agers have to un­der­take (Firms lay­ing off staff must keep S’porean core: NTUC, July 25).</p>
    <p>As much as com­pa­nies have the pre­rog­a­tive to make re­trench­ment de­ci­sions, they also have the moral obli­ga­tion to carry out re­trench­ments pro­fes­sion­ally and hu­manely.</p>
    <p>Some best prac­tices in­clude ac­cord­ing due re­spect to af­fected work­ers. Re­ceiv­ing news that their ser­vices are no longer re­quired is an emo­tional moment, and it can cause the re­cip­i­ent to go through an emo­tional roller-coaster ride.</p>
    <p>Meet­ings are best con­ducted in­di­vid­u­ally in a pri­vate room to ac­cord the re­cip­i­ent due pri­vacy to process the news.</p>
    <p>When­ever pos­si­ble, a rea­son­able pe­riod of time must be given to al­low work­ers to pack their per­sonal be­long­ings and say</p>
    <p>The golden rule for hu­man re­sources is to ad­vise man­age­ment to do all that is rea­son­able to pro­tect the dig­nity of re­trenched work­ers. Ev­ery­one else in the com­pany will be watch­ing, and the day will come when it has to hire again.</p>
    <p>farewell to their co-work­ers.</p>
    <p>Un­less a se­cu­rity threat is im­mi­nent, work­ers must never be es­corted out of the of­fice as if they are not wor­thy of be­ing trusted. This act can have even more of an im­pact (on a per­son’s pride) than los­ing one’s job.</p>
    <p>An­other crit­i­cal point of­ten over­looked is the use of the right lan­guage. To tell a worker that he has been made re­dun­dant is not quite the same as say­ing his job no longer ex­ists.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rat­ing the in­cum­bent from the job can make a dif­fer­ence in how the news is re­ceived. In re­al­ity, the worker needs to un­der­stand that other than los­ing his job, noth­ing else has been lost, and he can take his ex­pe­ri­ence and skills to an­other em­ployer.</p>
    <p>The golden rule for hu­man re­sources is to ad­vise man­age­ment to do all that is rea­son­able to pro­tect the dig­nity of re­trenched work­ers. Ev­ery­one else in the com­pany will be watch­ing, and the day will come when it has to hire again.</p>
    <p>I am sure any com­pany would want to be known as one that re­spects in­di­vid­u­als, even at the point of ser­vice sep­a­ra­tion.</p>
