    <p>Two spe­cial ed­u­ca­tion (Sped) schools will be mov­ing in five years to a new site, where they will ac­com­mo­date more stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Chaoyang School and Tan­glin School, which are both run by the As­so­ci­a­tion for Per­sons with Spe­cial Needs, will also un­dergo re­de­vel­op­ment to build more fa­cil­i­ties to cater to stu­dents with mild in­tel­lec­tual dis­abil­ity as well as across the autism spec­trum.</p>
    <p>The schools will be lo­cated at a joint cam­pus at the former Da Qiao Pri­mary School in Ang Mo Kio in 2025. Chaoyang School is now in Ang Mo Kio and Tan­glin School is in Bukit Merah.</p>
    <p>At the new site, Chaoyang School will pro­vide 400 pri­mary-level places and Tan­glin School will have 350 sec­ondary-level places. They cur­rently have 320 and 260 stu­dents en­rolled re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter of State for Ed­u­ca­tion Sun Xuel­ing, speak­ing dur­ing a visit to Chaoyang School yes­ter­day, said the schools hope to pro­vide more places for chil­dren with mild in­tel­lec­tual dis­abil­ity who live in the north-east­ern and cen­tral re­gions.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun, who is also Min­is­ter of State for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment, said it will be more con­ve­nient for fam­i­lies to have both schools at the same site.</p>
    <p>It will also give the stu­dents a sense of fa­mil­iar­ity.</p>
    <p>About 95 per cent of pupils from Chaoyang School typ­i­cally move to Tan­glin School.</p>
    <p>The new joint cam­pus will be pur­pose-built, with larger class­rooms and spa­ces to cater to stu­dents, in­clud­ing those who also have autism spec­trum dis­or­der.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, there will be more fa­cil­i­ties for phys­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion, sports and games, as well as shel­tered and out­door play courts.</p>
    <p>Tan­glin School will also have more space set aside for vo­ca­tional train­ing fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>It cur­rently has four vo­ca­tional tracks – food and bev­er­age, re­tail op­er­a­tions, hor­ti­cul­ture and hospi­tal­ity ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Its prin­ci­pal Liza Ow said the new cam­pus could in time house a su­per­mar­ket or re­tail store for stu­dents to train in – an im­prove­ment over the min­i­mart the school cur­rently op­er­ates.</p>
    <p>“One of the chal­lenges right now is about space. Our rooms are all over the school – which­ever the space that is best able to ac­com­mo­date that par­tic­u­lar vo­ca­tional ed­u­ca­tion sub­ject, we will use that space,” she said.</p>
    <p>With the re­de­vel­op­ment, she said the school will have des­ig­nated spa­ces for such sub­jects so that stu­dents’ move­ment will be min­imised and learn­ing will be more con­ducive.</p>
    <p>Par­ents whose chil­dren are now in Chaoyang School said the new joint cam­pus would help ease the chil­dren’s tran­si­tion into sec­ondary school.</p>
    <p>Ms Chua Shan Shan, 38, whose Pri­mary 5 son was di­ag­nosed with autism, said: “For chil­dren with autism, a change in en­vi­ron­ment can cause a lot of anx­i­ety.</p>
    <p>“Both schools be­ing side by side will help re­duce that anx­i­ety and I’m sure there will be a lot of op­por­tu­ni­ties for staff and stu­dents to have more in­ter­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“Par­ents from both schools can also work to­gether to or­gan­ise learn­ing jour­neys and ac­tiv­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>The pri­vate tu­tor, who lives in Hougang, said the cam­pus re­lo­ca­tion is also a bonus. She was wor­ried about her son hav­ing a longer com­mute to Bukit Merah.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Sun: “We’re con­stantly look­ing for more new ways to pro­mote in­clu­sive ed­u­ca­tion, be it greater in­ter­ac­tion be­tween Sped schools and main­stream schools, or more op­por­tu­ni­ties be­tween pri­mary schools and sec­ondary schools.”</p>
    <p>RE­DUCE CHIL­DREN’S ANX­I­ETY For chil­dren with autism, a change in en­vi­ron­ment can cause a lot of anx­i­ety. Both schools be­ing side by side will help re­duce that anx­i­ety and I’m sure there will be a lot of op­por­tu­ni­ties for staff and stu­dents to have more in­ter­ac­tion. MS CHUA SHAN SHAN, whose Pri­mary 5 son was di­ag­nosed with autism, on how the new joint cam­pus would help ease the chil­dren’s tran­si­tion into sec­ondary school.</p>
