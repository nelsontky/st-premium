    <p>The per­sonal in­for­ma­tion from 1.1 mil­lion RedMart user ac­counts was stolen from a cus­tomer data­base and put up for sale on an on­line fo­rum.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for e-com­merce gi­ant Lazada, which owns e-gro­cer RedMart, con­firmed the data breach yes­ter­day, and said that the per­sonal in­for­ma­tion stolen in­cluded names, phone num­bers, email and mail­ing ad­dresses, en­crypted pass­words and par­tial credit card num­bers.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is in the process of reach­ing out to af­fected cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>“Our cy­ber-se­cu­rity team dis­cov­ered an in­di­vid­ual claim­ing to be in pos­ses­sion of a RedMart cus­tomer data­base taken from a legacy RedMart sys­tem no longer in use by the com­pany,” the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>“This RedMart-only in­for­ma­tion is more than 18 months out of date and not linked to any Lazada data­base.”</p>
    <p>In a notificati­on sent to af­fected users via e-mail and posted on its web­site, Lazada said the breach was dis­cov­ered on Thurs­day as part of “proac­tive mon­i­tor­ing”, and stressed that “cur­rent cus­tomer data” is not af­fected by the breach.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has also taken ac­tion to block unau­tho­rised ac­cess to the data­base and in­formed the Per­sonal Data Pro­tec­tion Com­mis­sion (PDPC) of the breach.</p>
    <p>A PDPC spokesman said the com­mis­sion is aware of the in­ci­dent and is cur­rently in­ves­ti­gat­ing it.</p>
    <p>As a se­cu­rity mea­sure, Lazada has logged all af­fected cus­tomers out of their ex­ist­ing ac­counts. When th­ese cus­tomers log in, they will be asked to cre­ate a new pass­word.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers have also been ad­vised to change their pass­words fre­quently.</p>
    <p>Lazada also warned cus­tomers to be on the alert for phish­ing emails, where scam­mers ask for sen­si­tive in­for­ma­tion while pre­tend­ing to be from Lazada.</p>
    <p>“Lazada does not re­quest cus­tomers to ver­ify your per­sonal in­for­ma­tion,” the com­pany said in the notificati­on.</p>
    <p>The breach likely hap­pened due to an un­se­cured data­base on Ma­gento – a com­monly used on­line re­tail pay­ment plat­form – be­ing ex­posed to the In­ter­net with­out proper au­then­ti­ca­tion, said Mr Stas Po­tassov, co-founder and pres­i­dent of cy­ber-se­cu­rity firm Acro­nis.</p>
    <p>“Al­though the data sam­ples pro­vided by the at­tack­ers are from 2019, it could still be used to cre­ate per­son­alised phish­ing at­tacks or even to (crack) the (en­crypted) pass­words for fur­ther at­tacks,” Mr Po­tassov added.</p>
    <p>“There­fore, it is es­sen­tial for cus­tomers to im­me­di­ately change their pass­words and stay vig­i­lant for scam e-mails that might abuse this in­for­ma­tion in the near fu­ture.”</p>

    <p>Our cy­ber-se­cu­rity team dis­cov­ered an in­di­vid­ual claim­ing to be in pos­ses­sion of a RedMart cus­tomer data­base taken from a legacy RedMart sys­tem no longer in use by the com­pany...</p>
    <p>This RedMart-only in­for­ma­tion is more than 18 months out of date and not linked to any Lazada data­base.</p>
