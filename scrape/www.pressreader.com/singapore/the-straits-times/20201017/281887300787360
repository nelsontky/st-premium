    <p>We find, more than ever, that the world is split. Re­cent years have been trou­bled by height­ened po­lit­i­cal and so­cial con­flicts across the globe. So­ci­eties in ev­ery con­ti­nent are riven into po­lar­i­ties with ac­com­pa­ny­ing at­ten­tion to fake news. This isn’t matched by com­men­su­rate at­ten­tion to its bi­nary op­po­site, truth.</p>
    <p>We are in dire need of re­flec­tion on what it means to seek truth.</p>
    <p>TRUTH AND TRUTHS</p>
    <p>There is the Truth and there are truths, hu­man dis­cov­er­ies and un­der­stand­ings held to be true un­til proven oth­er­wise.</p>
    <p>Truth is quin­tes­sen­tial, whereas what is held to be true is, in some way, ephemeral and sub­jec­tive.</p>
    <p>Over time we have seen how the pur­suit of knowl­edge and un­der­stand­ing has yielded evolv­ing truths. The dis­cov­er­ies of New­ton, Ein­stein, and the ad­vances of quan­tum physics present a se­ries of truths about the ma­te­rial re­al­i­ties of our uni­verse. The quest for “the grand the­ory of every­thing” is never-end­ing.</p>
    <p>The best ef­forts in hu­man his­tory to es­tab­lish truths have been shown, time and again, to be but at­tempts to at­tain the Truth.</p>
    <p>In the sciences, lim­i­ta­tions in con­cep­tions and ex­per­i­ments ex­cite and stim­u­late fur­ther re­search. In the arts, truth-seek­ing re­volves around de­tailed ob­ser­va­tions about na­ture and the hu­man con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Art-mak­ing is a mys­tery, giv­ing voice and form to what is in­side the self, pre­sent­ing the lived truth of the artist to his au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>EX­PLO­RATION</p>
    <p>In the uni­ver­sity, the arts and the sciences are aca­demic realms of truth-seek­ing. They are en­vi­ron­ments in which new knowl­edge is sought, dis­cussed, and es­tab­lished.</p>
    <p>But truth-seek­ing isn’t con­fined to the li­brary or the lab­o­ra­tory. It is an ev­ery­day prac­tice in­volv­ing ex­plo­ration, in­tro­spec­tion and re­flec­tion.</p>
    <p>I re­flected on this with Lat­iff Mo­hidin, with­out doubt the most highly rated Malaysian artist liv­ing to­day.</p>
    <p>There was an ex­hi­bi­tion of his art in Paris in 2018, at the Cen­tre Pom­pi­dou, which later jour­neyed to Kuala Lumpur and ended re­cently in Sin­ga­pore at the Na­tional Gallery.</p>
    <p>In the 1960s, he trav­elled through South-east Asia, across In­dochina. He went to study in Ger­many on a schol­ar­ship. He reads ex­tremely widely, draw­ing in­flu­ences from many dif­fer­ent cul­tures. He is not only a painter, but also a poet and trans­la­tor. In my in­ter­ac­tions with him, I hap­pened to ask about his child­hood. He told me about mer­an­tau, the Mi­nangk­abau tra­di­tion of send­ing boys at pu­berty away from home, out into the world. Ex­plo­ration, in­tro­spec­tion and re­flec­tion are in­ter­twined in the rite of pas­sage of mer­an­tau in Mi­nangk­abau cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Ex­plo­ration is at the heart of mer­an­tau. Lat­iff Mo­hidin wrote in one of his pub­li­ca­tions: “Ev­ery child, with­out him know­ing it, is an ad­ven­turer.”</p>
    <p>To be an ex­plorer in this sense isn’t about trav­el­ling in search of thrills from risky phys­i­cal ac­tiv­i­ties or In­sta­grammable sen­sory ex­pe­ri­ences. It is about open­ing up the self to the world, whet­ting our in­nate cu­rios­ity and de­sire for knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>Ex­plor­ing al­lows you to go out – into the world; and go in – to­wards a deeper un­der­stand­ing of the self. As the poet T.S. Eliot said:</p>
    <p>We shall not cease from ex­plo­ration And the end of all our ex­plor­ing</p>
    <p>Will be to ar­rive where we started And know the place for the first time. Mer­an­tau shaped Lat­iff Mo­hidin as man and artist. Open­ness is char­ac­ter­is­tic of his oeu­vre, as in the case of all great artists. His Pago-Pago se­ries, for in­stance, man­i­fests his in­ter­pre­ta­tions of the Eastern mo­tif of the pagoda, demon­strat­ing his en­gage­ment with tra­di­tion, na­ture and his­tory through fresh forms.</p>
    <p>OPEN­NESS</p>
    <p>By na­ture, I am more a me­di­a­tor than one who is in­clined to­wards con­test­ing.</p>
    <p>I will con­test a view if it is war­ranted, but con­test­ing is a tool I use ul­ti­mately to seek a me­di­ated end. This brings me to a very sim­ple prin­ci­ple I use which I feel isn’t used enough: tri­an­gu­la­tion.</p>
    <p>To ar­rive at a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing, the in­ter­sec­tions of dif­fer­ent realms of knowl­edge need to be ex­am­ined.</p>
    <p>At most meet­ings I am lis­ten­ing out for di­verse points of view. In board de­lib­er­a­tions I look for in­ter­sec­tions, ex­plor­ing around them to look for not just com­mon ground but clar­ity.</p>
    <p>Truth-seek­ing in this sense nec­es­sar­ily in­volves in­tro­spec­tion and re­flec­tion. In­tro­spec­tion is in­ter­nal to your­self, di­gest­ing one’s thoughts and ex­pe­ri­ences. Re­flec­tion takes one be­yond one’s self, for when we re­flect, we learn to draw on the knowl­edge and ex­pe­ri­ence of oth­ers, in­clud­ing their in­tro­spec­tions. This is how we gain col­lec­tive wis­dom.</p>
    <p>Truth-seek­ing is about lis­ten­ing, be­ing open to dif­fer­ent ap­proaches, dif­fer­ent sys­tems of thought.</p>
    <p>Quite of­ten, we fail to re­alise that truth can be cul­ture-bound. Eastern philo­soph­i­cal tra­di­tions are a dif­fer­ent cul­ture of seek­ing knowl­edge from that of sci­en­tific in­quiry.</p>
    <p>The ev­i­dence-based Western sys­tem of knowl­edge came about in the Age of En­light­en­ment. But this is not the only vi­able mode of un­der­stand­ing the world, as other realms of knowl­edge have shown.</p>
    <p>The No­bel Prize in Medicine was awarded three years ago to a trio of sci­en­tists for their re­search on cir­ca­dian rhythms. This sci­en­tific field is also an area of an­cient knowl­edge and an­i­mistic prac­tice. Cir­ca­dian rhythms have long been cen­tral to tra­di­tional Chi­nese medicine. Indige­nous peo­ples, too, have known about them for a long time through lived ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Dif­fer­ences in opin­ion about an is­sue are of­ten the re­sult of cul­tural dif­fer­ence. Be­ing aware of how our per­sonal and so­cial truths are cul­ture-bound makes us ap­pre­ci­ate the need for all of us to be mind­ful and open to other philoso­phies and sys­tems of be­lief.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the schools sys­tem in Sin­ga­pore was changed in the 1970s and 1980s, truth meant dif­fer­ent things depend­ing on the lan­guage and cul­ture in your school.</p>
    <p>If you had at­tended a Chi­nese school in the old days, how you un­der­stand things is very dif­fer­ent as op­posed to some­one who went to an English school. Dif­fer­ent val­ues seed dif­fer­ent truths and vice versa.</p>
    <p>There is a nec­es­sary virtue of hu­mil­ity in all this. All our at­tempts can lead to truth only if we recog­nise first of all that no mat­ter how dom­i­nant or cor­rect a view may be at some point in time, it’s never for all time. The only ex­cep­tion would be cer­tain eter­nal truths, which are privy only to the saintli­est and the wis­est.</p>
    <p>To­day, we see con­flicts that arise from cul­tural dif­fer­ence in the arena of global busi­ness and pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>The world is clearly en­ter­ing a clash of dif­fer­ent sys­tems of thought: China ver­sus the US. This global geopo­lit­i­cal re­al­ity is volatile and im­pacts our lives and that of fu­ture gen­er­a­tions. If we are not nu­anced and open to new ways of see­ing and un­der­stand­ing, we will be in trou­ble.</p>
    <p>AR­RIV­ING AT WHO YOU ARE</p>
    <p>When I have to make very dif­fi­cult de­ci­sions, in­ject­ing a sense of feel­ing is ex­tremely im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>Very of­ten, hard de­ci­sions in­volve lives; there are stakes for the per­sons in­volved, and thus po­ten­tial sit­u­a­tions of con­flict. All the hard de­ci­sions I have had to make have been de­cided not only by ideas and rea­son, but also by senses and feel­ings. To­gether, they bring clar­ity.</p>
    <p>Open­ness to one’s in­tu­ition is at play; open­ness to oth­ers too. What is at stake is lived truth, the in­ter­nal­is­ing of truth to one’s self.</p>
    <p>Truth-seek­ing, as I see it, hap­pens in the ev­ery­day and is life­long. Very of­ten the word “truth” leads peo­ple to imag­ine some­thing im­mov­able and mono­lithic like a moun­tain.</p>
    <p>Truth is sought in the hope that it will be given, and that all we have to do is to wait to re­ceive it. In­stead, truth is dy­namic and truth-seek­ing is a way of life.</p>
    <p>How to bring truth into your life so that it grounds you – that, in­deed, is the real chal­lenge of one’s life.</p>
