    <p>TOKYO • Tokyo Olympics test events will resume in March and a de­ci­sion on fan at­ten­dance will come in the spring, an of­fi­cial said yes­ter­day, as prepa­ra­tions con­tin­ued for the post­poned Games de­spite on­go­ing coro­n­avirus fears.</p>
    <p>The com­ments from Yasuo Mori, deputy ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of the Games Oper­a­tions Bureau, come after In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee chief Thomas Bach l ast week said he was “very con­fi­dent” the Games will have fans.</p>
    <p>The first event will be the Fina artis­tic swim­ming Olympic qual­i­fy­ing tour­na­ment from March 4-7 at the Tokyo Aquat­ics Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The Fina Div­ing World Cup, the Gym­nas­tics World Cup, the In­ter­na­tional Vol­ley­ball Games and the artis­tic qual­i­fy­ing event, or­gan­ised by in­ter­na­tional fed­er­a­tions and the Ja­panese na­tional fed­er­a­tions, will fea­ture “over­seas ath­letes” but there will be no for­eign spec­ta­tors, said Mori.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal fans will be al­lowed at some of the test events, which will also be used to as­sess Covid-19 safety mea­sures and con­tin­gency plans.</p>
    <p>Most of the test events, which func­tion as dress re­hearsals for each sport, had al­ready taken place be­fore the Games were de­layed in March. But 18 re­main to be held.</p>
    <p>The Tokyo Olympics were post­poned for a year over the coro­n­avirus, be­com­ing the first to be resched­uled in peace time. The 2020 Games will now start on July 23 next year.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Kyodo News, ath­letes at the Games will have to wear masks at all times and prac­tise so­cial distancing. The only ex­cep­tions are dur­ing com­pe­ti­tion and meal times.</p>
    <p>Break­fast at the Ath­letes’ Vil­lage will be limited to 30 min­utes while the time taken for lunch and din­ner can go up to an hour. To has­ten pro­ceed­ings, ath­letes will re­ceive the menus on their mo­bile phones.</p>
    <p>This month, Tokyo suc­cess­fully staged a four-nation gym­nas­tics com­pe­ti­tion in front of a so­cially dis­tanced crowd who were told not to shout or cheer.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan has seen a rel­a­tively small coro­n­avirus out­break over­all, with just over 2,000 deaths and 137,000 con­firmed cases.</p>
    <p>But it is now bat­tling a third wave of the pan­demic, re­port­ing record num­bers of daily in­fec­tions na­tion­wide in re­cent days.</p>
