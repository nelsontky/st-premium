    <p>A Bill set­ting out de­tails of pro­vi­sions to meet ad­di­tional ex­pen­di­ture amount­ing to $8 bil­lion will be tabled in Par­lia­ment next month for de­bate, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This third Sup­ple­men­tary Sup­ply Bill will go through the usual par­lia­men­tary pro­ceed­ings and has to be as­sented to by the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>The money is the Gov­ern­ment’s swift re­sponse to the fast-evolv­ing sit­u­a­tion aris­ing from the Covid-19 pan­demic, added Mr Heng, who is also the Fi­nance Min­is­ter and Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>“I will share the plans with the pub­lic in a timely and clear fash­ion while en­sur­ing full ac­count­abil­ity for the use of pub­lic monies.”</p>
    <p>He was re­spond­ing to Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Pan­jang), Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mount­bat­ten) and Ms Cheng Li Hui (Tampines GRC), who had asked whether the ex­tra $8 bil­lion in Covid-19 sup­port an­nounced last month would be de­bated in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>In a min­is­te­rial state­ment last month, Mr Heng said the money would be spent to save jobs, cre­ate new ones and seize new growth op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, in his re­sponse to the MPs, he re­it­er­ated that these ef­forts will be funded by re­al­lo­cat­ing money not used in other ar­eas like de­vel­op­ment projects.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment will not fur­ther tap Sin­ga­pore’s re­serves, he added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore had pre­vi­ously set aside nearly $100 bil­lion across four</p>
    <p>Bud­gets for Covid-19 sup­port pack­ages, all of which were de­bated, passed by the House and sub­se­quently ap­proved by the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Mr Liang pointed out that Sin­ga­pore’s rev­enue is pro­jected to slide fur­ther, ac­cord­ing to the lat­est Bud­get es­ti­mates last month. He asked if there was fur­ther scope to re­al­lo­cate money from Sin­ga­pore’s de­vel­op­ment ex­pen­di­ture to fund fur­ther spend­ing.</p>
    <p>He also noted that Sin­ga­pore’s Con­sti­tu­tion obliges the Gov­ern­ment to keep a bal­anced Bud­get in each five-year term.</p>
    <p>“How would the Gov­ern­ment weigh the con­sid­er­a­tion of re­al­lo­cat­ing funds set aside for de­vel­op­ment ex­pen­di­tures – which is our in­vest­ment for the fu­ture as well – ver­sus fur­ther draw­down on the re­serves?”</p>
    <p>Mr Heng replied that the main un­der-util­i­sa­tion for this fi­nan­cial year comes from de­vel­op­ment spend­ing caused by con­struc­tion de­lays ow­ing to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“For this fi­nan­cial year, there is still some scope – al­beit very lim­ited – for us to con­sider re­al­lo­ca­tion across the var­i­ous heads of ex­pen­di­ture,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But for fu­ture years, we are now care­fully re­view­ing the time­line for many of t he de­vel­op­ment projects.”</p>
    <p>It re­mains un­clear how t he Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion will play out, Mr Heng added. “So, we will have to ex­am­ine the var­i­ous op­tions very care­fully, but with a clear goal of en­abling us to nav­i­gate through this very ma­jor cri­sis, and emerge stronger.”</p>
