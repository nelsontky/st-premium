    <p>QIfeel left out of so­cial cir­cles in school be­cause I’m a quiet per­son who doesn’t know how to say the right thing and I have noth­ing in­ter­est­ing or funny to con­trib­ute dur­ing con­ver­sa­tions. My class­mates usu­ally ig­nore me when I join them dur­ing a con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>I am also self-con­scious be­cause I am ugly and have a bad acne prob­lem. The girl whom I have a crush on al­ways moves away from me when I try to talk to her. She once said she found me bor­ing, so even if looks didn’t mat­ter, my per­son­al­ity isn’t at­trac­tive ei­ther. Please tell me how I can be more pop­u­lar.</p>
    <p>Upset</p>
    <p>AIam sorry to hear that you feel so left out. The two is­sues that you have brought up seem to boil down to your sense of self-worth. What can we do to change the way you feel?</p>
    <p>First, though this may not be much of a con­so­la­tion, you are not alone in your plight. Many teenagers your age also suf­fer from a cer­tain awk­ward­ness when so­cial­is­ing with oth­ers.</p>
    <p>How­ever, with­out be­ing pre­sump­tu­ous, I won­der whether you may have con­fused be­ing so­cially skilled with be­ing pop­u­lar.</p>
    <p>The dif­fer­ence is that while the ma­jor­ity of peo­ple are able to find and main­tain friend­ships, be­com­ing pop­u­lar means be­ing ad­mired or liked by many peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Even celebri­ties and su­per­stars have a tough time main­tain­ing their looks to stay ahead in the pop­u­lar­ity race.</p>
    <p>Thank­fully, nor­mal peo­ple like us don’t have to look good to be ac­cepted. Peo­ple can still be drawn to you for your funny per­son­al­ity, your kind and giv­ing na­ture, or if you are a good con­ver­sa­tion­al­ist.</p>
    <p>If you have noth­ing in­ter­est­ing to con­trib­ute to the con­ver­sa­tion, be a good lis­tener. Even be­ing a good lis­tener takes skill as be­ing truly in­volved in what the other per­son is say­ing re­quires you to ask ques­tions and stay in­ter­ested.</p>
    <p>As for the girl you have a crush on, she, too, may be feel­ing just as so­cially awk­ward if she is around your age. Forc­ing her into a so­cial sit­u­a­tion may not be the best move.</p>
    <p>Have a chat with your par­ents and, if they are hon­est with you, they will share sto­ries about them­selves when they were your age and suf­fer­ing the plight of pim­ples as well.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, the acne that you are go­ing through is a phase and can be quickly reme­died. See your fam­ily doc­tor, who can pre­scribe some med­i­ca­tion or re­fer you to a skin spe­cial­ist to help you with your prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Learn to like your­self be­cause each and ev­ery­one of us is spe­cial to some­one.</p>
    <p>Make a list of all the pos­i­tive at­tributes you have, what your fam­ily and friends say of you, and de­rive self-es­teem from that.</p>
    <p>Most of all, peo­ple are at­tracted to peo­ple who like them­selves and are com­fort­able in their own skin be­cause this shows they have the ca­pac­ity to like oth­ers.</p>
