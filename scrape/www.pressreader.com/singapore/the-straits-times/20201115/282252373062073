    <p>Or­chard Ho­tel Sin­ga­pore’s new co-work­ing space, which oc­cu­pies the newly re­fur­bished Bar In­ter­mezzo, makes for a classy of­fice.</p>
    <p>With plush car­pets, deep couches and a bar counter as the lounge’s cen­tre­piece, it is con­ducive for both meet­ings and bang­ing out doc­u­ments that are over due.</p>
    <p>OF­FICE FOR THE DAY</p>
    <p>Al­though meant for use as a bar, the ho­tel has taken pains to retro­fit the space for co-work­ing, with black power plugs nes­tled sleekly un­der mar­ble cof­fee ta­bles and bar coun­ters. Bar stools with back and arm­rests are sur­pris­ingly com­fort­able when I work at a long com­mu­nal ta­ble.</p>
    <p>There are even seats that can be sec­tioned off with a sheer pri­vacy cur­tain. Great for meet­ings or that all-im­por­tant Zoom call.</p>
    <p>Make sure to book ahead of time. Gen­eral man­ager Lee Richards says the lounge has been see­ing healthy de­mand since it launched co-work­ing pack­ages late last month, with about 35 of 40 avail­able seats filled daily.</p>
    <p>If the lounge gets too full, guests can spill over to The Or­chard Cafe Lounge, with gar­den-in­spired decor and 20 more seats.</p>
    <p>FEEL­ING PECKISH?</p>
    <p>The pack­age in­cludes a free flow of cof­fee, tea, juices and soft drinks, as well as a pas­try. There are sweet and savoury op­tions in­clud­ing mush­room quiche, sausage rolls and cho­co­late or rasp­berry muffins.</p>
    <p>My pick is the curry puff, with a fluffy and but­tery crust and mor­eish fill­ing.</p>
    <p>For a more sub­stan­tial meal, or­der a value lunch bento set ($16) from the ho­tel’s spe­cial work-from­lounge menu, which in­cludes mains such as a baked chicken thigh or pan-seared bar­ra­mundi fil­let, as well as dessert.</p>
    <p>And if you need a pick-me-up, treat your­self to lunch at the ho­tel’s Can­tonese restau­rant Hua Ting, which of­fers a 30 per cent dis­count for work-fromho­tel guests. Lunch set menus with sig­na­tures such as baked sea perch and crispy roasted pork will not dis­ap­point.</p>
    <p>PERKS</p>
    <p>Guests get free park­ing for the day and a suite of ser­vices in­clud­ing com­pli­men­tary black-and-white print­ing, a 20 per cent dis­count for meet­ing room rental and mail ser­vices with stamps in­cluded. The concierge can also store your be­long­ings for a few hours while you nip out to run er­rands in town.</p>
