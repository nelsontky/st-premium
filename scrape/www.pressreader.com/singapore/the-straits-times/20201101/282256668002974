    <p>The sin­gle-minded pur­suit of hand­made per­fec­tion and the sweet sound of mu­sic – that is what the dream life looks like for Wayne Lim, one of Sin­ga­pore’s hand­ful of pro­fes­sional gui­tar mak­ers.</p>
    <p>He started Luthier.sg, a com­pany that re­pairs and builds be­spoke gui­tars, in 2017.</p>
    <p>He has lov­ingly put to­gether seven gui­tars from scratch so far and as­sem­bled many more from pre-made parts in a work­shop in his mother’s Toa Payoh flat.</p>
    <p>Each gui­tar is metic­u­lously made to spec­i­fi­ca­tion and takes six months to a year to com­plete. They cost up­wards of $4,000.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old says: “When I build a gui­tar, I build it for a player not a col­lec­tor. What’s the point of hav­ing a nice gui­tar if it doesn’t get played?”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sional gui­tarist Si­mon Lai has been us­ing an elec­tric gui­tar cus­tom-made by Lim in the past two years. The 35-year-old from Sin­ga­pore-Aus­tralian rock band Cy­na­tion says: “His build is as world-class as it can get. His gui­tar feels great, looks great and, most im­por­tantly, sounds great.”</p>
    <p>One thing that makes Lim’s gui­tars stand out is that he hand­makes the pick­ups in his cus­tom elec­tric gui­tars, un­usual given the easy avail­abil­ity of pre-made ones.</p>
    <p>Pick­ups cap­ture the vi­bra­tions from the strings, send the sig­nal to am­pli­fiers and have a big in­flu­ence on the gui­tar’s sound.</p>
    <p>The seeds of Lim’s love for craft­ing were planted early.</p>
    <p>He was eight the first time he did woodwork with his grand­fa­ther, a hob­by­ist car­pen­ter. At 12, he found his sec­ond pas­sion af­ter watch­ing lo­cal bands per­form at a gig.</p>
    <p>He per­suaded his mother to en­rol him for gui­tar lessons; his fa­ther bought him his first elec­tric gui­tar. His mother is a train­ing di­rec­tor at a prop­erty de­vel­oper while his fa­ther runs a mu­seum in Chi­na­town.</p>
    <p>When he was 13, he started do­ing gui­tar re­pair and main­te­nance work for one of the gui­tar shops in the base­ment of Penin­sula Ex­cel­sior. A few years later, he started a sec­ond job as a gui­tarist for the res­i­dent bands at clubs such as Me­dusa and Shang­hai Dolly.</p>
    <p>Lim moved to Los An­ge­les in 2015 to study gui­tar craft and acous­tic gui­tar de­sign at the Mu­si­cians In­sti­tute for a year. He stayed on for six months af­ter grad­u­a­tion, but came home af­ter he and his then-fi­ancee suc­cess­fully ap­plied for a Build-to-Or­der flat.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple mar­ried last year and now live in Pung­gol.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, Lim’s busi­ness went up by 50 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mu­si­cians are play­ing their gui­tars more, now that most peo­ple are spend­ing more time at home due to the pan­demic, he reck­ons.</p>
    <p>But he makes the time to work on a project close to his heart – a ukulele for his wife, a pi­ano teacher. She has al­ways been sup­port­ive of his pas­sion for gui­tars, he says. “Be­sides my mum, it was my wife who mo­ti­vated me. They were the ones who con­vinced me that I should start up my own com­pany, that I could do it on my own.”</p>
