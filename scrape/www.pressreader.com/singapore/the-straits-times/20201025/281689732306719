    <p>The elec­tion and the pandemic are col­lid­ing in the United States, with the coun­try reg­is­ter­ing on Fri­day its high­est daily num­ber of cases since the pandemic be­gan.</p>
    <p>Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity re­ported 83,757 new cases.</p>
    <p>This comes as Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump in­creases the fre­quency of his ral­lies in crit­i­cal states, in­clud­ing Florida, where on Fri­day a large crowd of his sup­port­ers as­sem­bled at the re­tire­ment com­mu­nity, The Vil­lages, out in the open but with many not wear­ing masks.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump cast an early bal­lot yes­ter­day, ahead of the Nov 3 vote, at a li­brary serv­ing as a polling cen­tre in West Palm Beach, Florida. “I voted for a guy named Trump,” he said with a smile as he emerged.</p>
    <p>Separately, on Fri­day, Mr Trump’s ri­val Joe Bi­den, who has been hold­ing cam­paign events with smaller and more so­cially dis­tanced au­di­ences, made a speech on his strat­egy to con­trol the pandemic if he were elected pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s strat­egy in­cludes a man­date to use face masks, at least on fed­eral prop­erty and in­ter­state trans­port through­out the coun­try; ramp­ing up test­ing and rais­ing a na­tional corps of con­tact trac­ers; and us­ing the De­fence Pro­duc­tion Act to scale up pro­duc­tion of per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment.</p>
    <p>A Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion would “pro­vide con­sis­tent, re­li­able, trusted, de­tailed na­tion­wide guid­ance and tech­ni­cal sup­port for re­open­ing safely and the re­sources to make it hap­pen”, he said.</p>
    <p>But opin­ion polls show that the pandemic is not a pri­or­ity is­sue for Trump sup­port­ers, in par­tic­u­lar, who care more about the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Na­tion­ally, sur­veys in­di­cate that the econ­omy, the make-up of the Supreme Court bench and health­care are top is­sues.</p>
    <p>A Pew Research sur­vey re­leased last Wed­nes­day showed that the gap be­tween sup­port­ers of the ri­val camps over the im­por­tance of the pandemic has widened since Au­gust.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey was con­ducted from Oct 6 to 12. About 74 per cent of 8,972 reg­is­tered vot­ers polled said the econ­omy was a very im­por­tant is­sue to their vote. But there was a sharp de­cline in the share of Trump backers who rated the coro­n­avirus as “very im­por­tant”, Pew said.</p>
    <p>“About eight in 10 Bi­den sup­port­ers (82 per cent) say the coro­n­avirus will be very im­por­tant to their vote, com­pared with just 24 per cent of</p>
    <p>Trump sup­port­ers,” the re­port said.</p>
    <p>“Since Au­gust, the share of Trump sup­port­ers who view the coro­n­avirus as very im­por­tant has de­clined 15 per­cent­age points. There has been no change among Bi­den sup­port­ers.”</p>
    <p>A sep­a­rate Gallup poll re­leased on Oct 5 found that nearly nine in 10 reg­is­tered vot­ers con­sider the pres­i­den­tial can­di­dates’ po­si­tions on the econ­omy very or ex­tremely im­por­tant to their vote.</p>
    <p>At least three-quar­ters of vot­ers con­sider six other is­sues to be im­por­tant. In descend­ing or­der of im­por­tance, they are: ter­ror­ism and na­tional se­cu­rity, ed­u­ca­tion, health­care, crime, the re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus, and race re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>The pro­por­tion of vot­ers say­ing the econ­omy is ex­tremely im­por­tant rose from 30 per cent to 45 per cent be­tween last De­cem­ber and last month, Gallup re­ported.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey also noted a large gap of 32 points be­tween Democrats and Repub­li­cans on the im­por­tance of the pandemic, with Democrats far more con­cerned than Repub­li­cans.</p>
    <p>Anec­do­tally, based on mul­ti­ple in­ter­views across three states, Trump sup­port­ers in­ter­viewed by The Sun­day Times gen­er­ally be­lieve the Pres­i­dent has done the best he could to man­age the pandemic.</p>
    <p>Asked about the spik­ing case num­bers across the coun­try, Dr An­thony Fauci, di­rec­tor of the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Al­lergy and In­fec­tious Dis­eases, told MSNBC on Fri­day that the coun­try was in a “pre­car­i­ous place”.</p>
    <p>He said the US needs to dou­ble down on fun­da­men­tal pub­lic health mea­sures like the uni­ver­sal wear­ing of masks, phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing and avoid­ing crowds, par­tic­u­larly in­doors. “They seem rather sim­ple… but they re­ally do work,” he said.</p>
    <p>But with Mr Trump in­creas­ingly dis­mis­sive of him, the top ex­pert now car­ries less weight.</p>
