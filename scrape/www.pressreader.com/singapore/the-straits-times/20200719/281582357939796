    <p>WASHINGTON • Global coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions passed 14 mil­lion on Fri­day, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally, mark­ing the first time there has been a surge of one mil­lion cases in un­der 100 hours.</p>
    <p>The first case was de­tected in China late last year and it took sev­eral months to reach one mil­lion cases. It has taken just four days to climb to 14 mil­lion cases from 13 mil­lion recorded on July 13.</p>
    <p>The global caseload now stands at around 14.2 mil­lion in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The United States, with more than 3.7 mil­lion con­firmed cases, is still see­ing huge daily jumps in its first wave of Covid-19 in­fec­tions. The US re­ported a daily global record of more than 77,000 new in­fec­tions on Thurs­day, while Swe­den has re­ported a to­tal of 77,281 cases since the pan­demic be­gan.</p>
    <p>De­spite the surg­ing cases, a cul­tural di­vide is grow­ing in the US over the wear­ing of masks to slow the spread of the virus, a pre­cau­tion rou­tinely taken in many other na­tions.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and his fol­low­ers have re­sisted a fullthroat­ed en­dorse­ment of masks and have been call­ing for a re­turn to nor­mal eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity and re­open­ing of schools de­spite the surge in the num­ber of cases.</p>
    <p>Other hard-hit coun­tries have “flat­tened the curve” and are eas­ing lock­downs put in place to slow the spread of the virus while oth­ers, such as the ci­ties of Barcelona and Mel­bourne, are im­ple­ment­ing a sec­ond round of lo­cal lock­downs.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of cases glob­ally is around triple that of se­vere in­fluenza ill­nesses recorded an­nu­ally, ac­cord­ing to the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO).</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has now killed more than 600,000 peo­ple in about seven months, edg­ing to­wards the up­per range of yearly in­fluenza deaths re­ported world­wide.</p>
    <p>The first death was re­ported on Jan 10 in Wuhan, China, be­fore in­fec­tions and fa­tal­i­ties ac­cel­er­ated in Europe and later in the US.</p>
    <p>The Reuters tally, which is based on gov­ern­ment re­ports, shows the dis­ease is ac­cel­er­at­ing the fastest in the Amer­i­cas, which ac­count for more than half of the world’s in­fec­tions and half of its deaths.</p>
    <p>In Brazil, more than two mil­lion peo­ple have tested pos­i­tive for the virus, in­clud­ing Pres­i­dent Jair Bol­sonaro, and about 78,000 peo­ple have died so far.</p>
    <p>In­dia, the only other coun­try with more than one mil­lion cases, has been grap­pling with an av­er­age of al­most 30,000 new in­fec­tions each day for the last week. Those coun­tries were the main driv­ers be­hind the WHO on Fri­day re­port­ing a record one-day in­crease in global coro­n­avirus cases of 237,743.</p>
    <p>In coun­tries with lim­ited test­ing ca­pac­ity, case num­bers re­flect only a pro­por­tion of to­tal in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts say of­fi­cial data likely un­der-rep­re­sents the num­ber of both in­fec­tions and deaths.</p>
    <p>Ira­nian Pres­i­dent Has­san Rouhani yes­ter­day said 25 mil­lion Ira­ni­ans had been in­fected with Covid-19 and an­other 35 mil­lion were at risk as the coun­try reim­posed so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions in the cap­i­tal and else­where.</p>
    <p>The fig­ures Mr Rouhani cited were far higher than the day’s of­fi­cial toll of 271,606. His of­fice said they were based on “an es­ti­mated sce­nario” from a re­port by the health min­istry’s deputy min­is­ter of research.</p>
    <p>“Our es­ti­mate is that un­til now, 25 mil­lion Ira­ni­ans have been in­fected with this virus and about 14,000 have lost their dear lives,” Mr Rouhani said in the speech. “There is the pos­si­bil­ity that be­tween 30 and 35 mil­lion other peo­ple will be at risk.”</p>
    <p>He said more than 200,000 peo­ple had been hos­pi­talised and that the min­istry ex­pected that num­ber to dou­ble in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>Ira­nian au­thor­i­ties yes­ter­day reim­posed one-week re­stric­tions in the cap­i­tal of Te­heran in­clud­ing ban­ning re­li­gious and cul­tural func­tions, and clos­ing board­ing schools, cafes, in­door pools, amuse­ment parks and zoos.</p>
    <p>Iran, with a pop­u­la­tion of more than 80 mil­lion, has been the hard­est hit in the Mid­dle East since the pan­demic started in mid-April.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of cases glob­ally is around triple that of se­vere in­fluenza ill­nesses recorded an­nu­ally, ac­cord­ing to the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion. The pan­demic has now killed more than 600,000 peo­ple in about seven months, edg­ing to­wards the up­per range of yearly in­fluenza deaths re­ported world­wide. The first death was re­ported on Jan 10 in Wuhan, China, be­fore in­fec­tions and fa­tal­i­ties ac­cel­er­ated in Europe and later in the US.</p>
