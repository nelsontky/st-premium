    <p>Frasers Prop­erty has brought in a strate­gic cap­i­tal part­ner for the south wing of North­point City.</p>
    <p>TCC Pros­per­ity, through its wholly owned sub­sidiary Bright Bloom Cap­i­tal, has sub­scribed for 50 per cent of units of North Gem Trust, which owns the prop­erty in Yishun, said Frasers on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>TCC Pros­per­ity is part of the TCC Group, which is con­trolled by Mr Charoen Siri­vad­han­ab­hakdi and his wife, Ms Khun­y­ing Wanna Siri­vad­han­ab­hakdi, who are di­rec­tors and con­trol­ling share­hold­ers of Frasers Prop­erty.</p>
    <p>The trans­ac­tion val­ues North­point City (South Wing) at $1.1 bil­lion and al­lows the group to recog­nise a gain of $50 mil­lion over the as­set’s last au­dited book value as of Sept 30 last year.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the deal, Frasers Prop­erty’s sub­sidiary, FCL Am­ber, will hold the re­main­ing 50 per cent stake in North Gem Trust.</p>
    <p>As part of the agree­ment, Frasers Prop­erty and Bright Bloom Cap­i­tal have pre-emp­tive rights on each other’s stake in North­point City (South Wing).</p>
    <p>North­point City (South Wing), which is on Yishun Av­enue 2, fea­tures a two-storey re­tail podium with two base­ments, carpark fa­cil­i­ties as well as the Nee Soon Com­mu­nity Club and the Yishun Bus In­ter­change. It was com­pleted in De­cem­ber 2017 and has a let­table area of 26,994 sq m.</p>
    <p>Frasers Prop­erty Re­tail con­tin­ues to man­age North­point City.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Low Chee Wah, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Frasers Prop­erty Re­tail: “North­point City (South Wing) is a strate­gic com­po­nent of the group’s $8.63 bil­lion re­tail as­sets un­der man­age­ment in Sin­ga­pore. This trans­ac­tion is timely as it main­tains the group’s dis­ci­pline in op­ti­mis­ing cap­i­tal pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>“Amid chal­lenges brought about by Covid-19, we are pleased to have the sup­port of TCC as our strate­gic cap­i­tal part­ner for this trans­ac­tion. We will con­tinue to man­age North­point City, thereby en­hanc­ing the group’s long-term re­turn by grow­ing our as­set and prop­erty man­age­ment fee in­come.”</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to grow­ing with its real es­tate in­vest­ment trusts (Reits), the group has been step­ping up its cap­i­tal-part­ner­ship ini­tia­tives with third-party in­vestors.</p>
    <p>The trans­ac­tion fol­lows the eq­uity in­jec­tion by an in­vestor into Frasers Tower in fis­cal 2019, which re­sulted in both part­ners hold­ing a 50 per cent stake in the prop­erty.</p>
    <p>Last June, The Busi­ness Times re­ported that South Korea’s Na­tional Pen­sion Ser­vice was ex­pected to take a stake in Frasers Tower.</p>
    <p>Shares of Frasers Prop­erty closed 1.65 per cent higher at $1.23 yes­ter­day.</p>
