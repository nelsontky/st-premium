    <p>For Mr Ganesh Singh, who has been sell­ing teh tarik for over 30 years at Tekka Cen­tre, the ex­pert panel’s rec­om­men­da­tion for Sin­ga­pore’s hawker cul­ture to be in­cluded on Unesco’s in­tan­gi­ble cul­tural her­itage list is a “dream come true”.</p>
    <p>The 54-year-old, who was fea­tured in a video pro­duced last year as part of the coun­try’s nom­i­na­tion sub­mis­sion, said there were no words to ex­press his feel­ings.</p>
    <p>“I took a big breath when I heard the news. It’s an hon­our. With recog­ni­tion, young­sters will join us and make sure hawker cul­ture re­tains longevity,” he said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, the 12-mem­ber eval­u­a­tion body ap­pointed by the Unesco in­ter­gov­ern­men­tal com­mit­tee (IGC) re­leased its report rec­om­mend­ing the in­clu­sion, draw­ing cheers from stake­hold­ers of Sin­ga­pore’s hawker cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials from the Na­tional Her­itage Board, Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) and Fed­er­a­tion of Mer­chants’ As­so­ci­a­tions (FMAS) started col­lab­o­rat­ing on the bid in 2018. Mon­day’s de­ci­sion was a ten­ta­tive vic­tory as they look for­ward to the in­ter­gov­ern­men­tal com­mit­tee’s fi­nal de­ci­sion next month.</p>
    <p>FMAS vice-pres­i­dent and Boon Lay Hawker As­so­ci­a­tion chair­man An­thony Low Hock Kee, 52, told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that the news was both an “af­fir­ma­tion” and an “en­cour­age­ment”. Mr Low, who owns a cooked food stall, said the rec­om­men­da­tion “proves that the Sin­ga­porean hawker cul­ture is in­deed out­stand­ing”.</p>
    <p>Ms Na­dia Samdin, an MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC and a mem­ber of the Gov­ern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment, said hawker cul­ture is cen­tral to Sin­ga­pore’s food se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>She added: “Be­yond her­itage and mul­ti­cul­tur­al­ism, hawker food (provides) af­ford­able meals for lo­cals of all ages. For se­niors, be­ing able to go down to their near­est hawker cen­tre and dabao (take away) food dur­ing th­ese times gave them a sense of nor­malcy and rou­tine, as many hawk­ers are fa­mil­iar faces and cor­ner­stones of the com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>A few hawk­ers, how­ever, re­main clear-eyed on the chal­lenges faced by many of their col­leagues, such as the ris­ing cost of pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­thing is in­creas­ing,” said Mr Fir­daris Rosli, 26, who runs a nasi lemak stall. “Some peo­ple don’t un­der­stand why we in­crease prices. It’s not that we profit more, and it’s not fair that all of our hard work goes to a lesser profit. We in­crease the price based on our sup­pli­ers.”</p>
    <p>Young hawker Matthew Liu raised the is­sue of con­ti­nu­ity. The 30-year-old, who left a job in the bank­ing in­dus­try to help run his un­cle’s cooked food stall, said: “It’s not a dy­ing trade, but fewer young peo­ple are en­ter­ing the hawker busi­ness be­cause we all go into bank­ing, fi­nance and other trades. If no sec­ond- or third-gen­er­a­tion per­son steps in to take over, then this unique thing about Sin­ga­pore will be lost.”</p>
    <p>Still, both of them are hope­ful that this nom­i­na­tion will en­cour­age other younger hawk­ers to step into the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Thanks to in­cu­ba­tion and de­vel­op­ment pro­grammes by the NEA, the me­dian age for new en­trants has been 46 since 2013, well be­low the na­tional me­dian. The over­all me­dian age for hawk­ers is 59.</p>
    <p>Ms Anne Loh, pres­i­dent of non­profit or­gan­i­sa­tion Slow Food (Sin­ga­pore), which was part of the nom­i­na­tion com­mit­tee, said: “If suc­cess­ful, the (Unesco list in­clu­sion) will bring all Sin­ga­pore­ans to­gether in cel­e­bra­tion.”</p>
    <p>She added: “With the in­creased ap­pre­ci­a­tion that a suc­cess­ful nom­i­na­tion will bring, more Sin­ga­pore­ans will hope­fully pick up the ba­ton for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions.”</p>
    <p>Said FMAS pres­i­dent Yeo Hiang Meng: “Our hawker mem­bers are very proud of our nom­i­na­tion.”</p>
    <p>He added: “We hope that the IGC de­ci­sion in De­cem­ber will be a favourable one, which will bring about more aware­ness of our hawker cul­ture in­ter­na­tion­ally, and ac­knowl­edge­ment for our hawker mem­bers’ ded­i­ca­tion to­wards their craft.”</p>
