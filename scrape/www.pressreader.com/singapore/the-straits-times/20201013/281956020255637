    <p>I am of­ten asked how long it will take to re­pair the dam­age done by the cur­rent ad­min­is­tra­tion to the US’ global stand­ing. Cer­tainly, the coun­try can­not undo the ex­pe­ri­ence of be­ing rep­re­sented by Mr Trump. Just as a herd of ele­phants leaves be­hind traces of its pas­sage, so will the Trump team.</p>
    <p>Upon ar­riv­ing in New York as a refugee, aged 11, I soon be­came a proud and grate­ful Amer­i­can. Later, as a US diplo­mat, I of­ten pointed to the coun­try’s demo­cratic in­sti­tu­tions and ven­er­a­ble elec­toral process as mod­els. For­eign friends en­dorsed this as­sess­ment. When peo­ple looked to the United States, they gen­er­ally liked what they saw.</p>
    <p>This month, those happy mem­o­ries feel far away.</p>
    <p>Due to the an­tics of a Pres­i­dent born with both a sil­ver spoon and a forked tongue in his mouth, Amer­i­can democ­racy has been vis­i­bly and au­di­bly de­based.</p>
    <p>Watch­ing the re­cent de­bate be­tween Mr Don­ald Trump and his Demo­cratic chal­lenger, Mr Joe Bi­den, I felt as if I were trapped in­side an erupt­ing vol­cano with a howl­ing dog.</p>
    <p>A Pres­i­dent who claimed to rep­re­sent law and or­der re­fused to abide by the de­bate rules his own cam­paign had ac­cepted. He de­clined, as well, to con­demn the forces of racial big­otry, or to prom­ise to abide by the re­sults of the election. Based on his record, none of this was sur­pris­ing.</p>
    <p>Shortly af­ter­wards, Mr Trump and sev­eral peo­ple close to him tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus. Again, this was not sur­pris­ing, given the ad­min­is­tra­tion’s cav­a­lier at­ti­tude to­wards the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>There fol­lowed a grossly in­ept ef­fort by White House of­fi­cials to por­tray their boss as some­one who had “beaten” the virus, al­beit with the help of an elite med­i­cal team and ex­per­i­men­tal drugs.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s mes­sage – that no one should fear the virus – is re­but­ted by the bones and ashes of one mil­lion dead.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­cans are now choos­ing a leader for the next four years. There is no grander demo­cratic spec­ta­cle, yet this year there is also the po­ten­tial for cat­a­strophic dis­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>Rea­sons in­clude the chal­lenge of vot­ing safely in a pan­demic, the lo­gis­ti­cal bur­den of han­dling a huge num­ber of ab­sen­tee bal­lots, the prob­a­bil­ity that for­eign and do­mes­tic agents will seek to sway the process by spread­ing lies, and the Pres­i­dent’s own out­ra­geous ef­forts to un­der­mine pub­lic faith in demo­cratic in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>By al­leg­ing that the election will be rigged against him, Mr Trump is in­ten­tion­ally sow­ing the seeds of chaos, in­clud­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of vi­o­lent con­fronta­tions on election day and a flood of lit­i­ga­tion in its wake.</p>
    <p>Should the out­come be close, the verdict may not be known for weeks and will likely be re­jected as fraud­u­lent by one side or the other.</p>
    <p>No election is con­ducted flaw­lessly, and dis­putes over bal­lots are com­mon, but this time, Mr Trump will try to in­flate any mi­nor dis­crep­ancy into a ma­jor con­spir­acy. There are some on the ex­treme left ca­pa­ble of think­ing in the same way.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, the con­tro­versy may be set­tled by the Supreme Court, which for Bi­den sup­port­ers is a de­cid­edly un­set­tling propo­si­tion.</p>
    <p>It is pos­si­ble, of course, that the tally will be one-sided enough to make par­ti­san com­plaints ir­rel­e­vant. I hope so. But we should pre­pare for the worst and three facts are worth re­mem­ber­ing.</p>
    <p>First, pro­ce­dures for vot­ing have been de­vel­oped over many years and ben­e­fit from the guid­ance of non-par­ti­san ex­perts: Wide­spread fraud is both ex­tremely un­likely and rel­a­tively easy to de­tect.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, a few glitches are in­evitable but also re­me­di­a­ble and should not dis­credit the whole process.</p>
    <p>Third, re­gard­less of how hon­est and ef­fi­cient the vote count is, al­le­ga­tions of cheat­ing are sure to sur­face on so­cial me­dia and in par­ti­san el­e­ments of the press. With or with­out real fires, there will be plenty of smoke.</p>
    <p>It will be up to re­spon­si­ble lead­ers in both par­ties and pro­fes­sion­als in law, academia and jour­nal­ism, to help cit­i­zens sep­a­rate facts from ex­ag­ger­a­tions and lies. The more pre­pared we are for ef­forts to con­fuse, the bet­ter we can counter them.</p>
    <p>I am of­ten asked how long it will take to re­pair the dam­age done by the cur­rent ad­min­is­tra­tion to the US’ global stand­ing. Cer­tainly, the coun­try can­not undo the ex­pe­ri­ence of be­ing rep­re­sented by Mr Trump. Just as a herd of ele­phants leaves be­hind traces of its pas­sage, so will the Trump team.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, if elected, will in­herit a coun­try di­min­ished by his</p>
    <p>pre­de­ces­sor’s search for “great­ness” in all the wrong places.</p>
    <p>The new pres­i­dent’s task will be daunt­ing: to re­as­sure al­lies; re­assert lead­er­ship on cli­mate change and world health; forge ef­fec­tive coali­tions to check the am­bi­tions of China, Rus­sia and Iran; and re-es­tab­lish the US’ iden­tity as a cham­pion of democ­racy.</p>
    <p>Are Mr Bi­den and his team up to the job? With help from those who still wish the US well, the an­swer is surely yes.</p>
    <p>Will they have the chance? That de­pends on how US cit­i­zens have come to view the pur­pose and char­ac­ter of their na­tion.</p>
    <p>Does their vi­sion bear any re­sem­blance to the con­fi­dent, out­ward-look­ing coun­try that wel­comed my fam­ily to its shores in 1948? Or has time so nar­rowed the pop­u­lar per­spec­tive and mud­died our ca­pac­ity to dis­cern truth from lies that the US I fell in love with has faded into his­tory? For bet­ter or worse, we will soon know the an­swer.</p>
