    <p>Trucks lin­ing up to en­ter the Chan­nel Tun­nel in Folke­stone in Kent,</p>
    <p>Eng­land, on Fri­day. Lon­don and Brus­sels agreed yes­ter­day to “go the ex­tra mile” to try to reach an elu­sive trade agree­ment be­fore Dec 31, when the Brexit tran­si­tion pe­riod ends, to pre­vent bor­der chaos that would dis­rupt ship­ments of food, goods and parts.</p>
    <p>BRUS­SELS/LON­DON • Lon­don and Brus­sels have agreed to “go the ex­tra mile” in com­ing days to try to reach an elu­sive trade agree­ment de­spite miss­ing their lat­est dead­line to avert a tur­bu­lent no-deal exit for Bri­tain from the Euro­pean Union at the end of the month.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son and Euro­pean Com­mis­sion chief Ur­sula von der Leyen had given ne­go­tia­tors a dead­line of yes­ter­day to find a way to re­solve an im­passe on ar­range­ments that would guar­an­tee Bri­tain zero-tar­iff and zero-quota ac­cess to the EU’s sin­gle mar­ket.</p>
    <p>They have now man­dated their ne­go­tia­tors to con­tinue.</p>
    <p>“De­spite the ex­haus­tion af­ter almost a year of ne­go­ti­a­tions, de­spite the fact that dead­lines have been missed over and over, we think it is re­spon­si­ble at this point to go the ex­tra mile,” Mr John­son and Dr von der Leyen said in a joint state­ment.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain left the EU in Jan­uary but re­mains an in­for­mal mem­ber un­til Dec 31 – the end of a tran­si­tion pe­riod dur­ing which it has re­mained in the EU sin­gle mar­ket and Cus­toms union.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son said the two sides would try to be as cre­ative as pos­si­ble, but Bri­tain could not com­pro­mise on key red lines.</p>
    <p>A fi­nal Brexit with­out a trade deal would dam­age the economies of Europe, send shock waves through fi­nan­cial mar­kets, snarl borders and sow chaos through the del­i­cate sup­ply chains across Europe and be­yond.</p>
    <p>Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel said: “Ev­ery op­por­tu­nity to reach a deal is highly wel­come.”</p>
    <p>The two sides have strug­gled to agree on fish­ing rights in Bri­tish waters and EU de­mands that Bri­tain face con­se­quences if in the fu­ture it di­verges from the bloc’s rules for fair com­pe­ti­tion – what it calls a level play­ing field.</p>
    <p>Said one EU diplo­mat: “They are mak­ing some in­roads on dif­fi­cult stuff. How to man­age di­ver­gence and soften the blows for (EU) fish­er­men is still open.”</p>
    <p>EU diplo­mats told Reuters that if there was no time for a deal to be ap­proved by the EU Par­lia­ment, the bloc’s mem­ber states could en­dorse an agree­ment reached by ne­go­tia­tors to al­low for “pro­vi­sional ap­pli­ca­tion”.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish govern­ment has warned that even with a trade deal, 7,000 trucks head­ing for Chan­nel ports in south-east Eng­land could be held in 100km queues if com­pa­nies do not pre­pare the ex­tra pa­per­work re­quired.</p>
    <p>Long queues of trucks had al­ready started form­ing last week at the English port of Dover.</p>
    <p>Lo­gis­tics groups have re­ported surg­ing de­mand from com­pa­nies try­ing to bring in parts, goods and food be­fore Dec 31.</p>
    <p>High­ways Eng­land, the au­thor­ity man­ag­ing the coun­try’s land trans­port, also said there were high vol­umes of freight traf­fic head­ing to­wards the port of Dover and that lor­ries had been backed up along some roads to pre­vent it from be­com­ing over­whelmed.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish min­is­ters have also warned su­per­mar­kets to stock­pile food amid fears of short­ages, Bri­tain’s The Sun­day Times news­pa­per re­ported.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ters have told sup­pli­ers of medicines, med­i­cal de­vices and vac­cines to stock­pile six weeks’ worth at se­cure lo­ca­tions in the coun­try, the re­port added.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain, how­ever, is ex­pected to fast-track the move­ment of some per­ish­able goods, such as seafood, when the tran­si­tion pe­riod ends.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of De­fence said four Royal Navy pa­trol ships will be ready on Jan 1 to help pro­tect Bri­tain’s fish­ing waters in the event of no-deal.</p>
    <p>There are con­cerns about pos­si­ble skir­mishes be­tween Bri­tish and for­eign fish­ing ves­sels un­der that sce­nario be­cause ex­ist­ing rules that give EU boats ac­cess to Bri­tish waters will ex­pire.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean Coun­cil pres­i­dent Charles Michel told France In­ter ra­dio the bloc would keep its cool.</p>
    <p>France also shrugged off the naval de­ploy­ment plans.</p>
    <p>“Keep calm and carry on,” an of­fi­cial at the French pres­i­den­tial of­fice said last Satur­day, us­ing a Bri­tish wartime slo­gan.</p>
