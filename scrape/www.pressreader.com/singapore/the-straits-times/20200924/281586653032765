    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic must serve as an “elec­tric shock” that wakes up the United Na­tions, French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron said in a speech on Tues­day that in­cluded veiled at­tacks on the United States and China.</p>
    <p>UNITED NA­TIONS • The coro­n­avirus pan­demic must serve as an “elec­tric shock” that wakes up the United Na­tions, French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron said in a speech on Tues­day that in­cluded veiled at­tacks on the US and China.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron is try­ing to re­vive the mul­ti­lat­eral or­der, which has been strained to break­ing point by the in­creas­ingly hos­tile ri­valry be­tween the US and China.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s de­ter­mi­na­tion to re­draw Amer­ica’s ties with the world has seen the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion side­lined and deals on cli­mate change and Iran’s nu­clear pro­gramme called into ques­tion.</p>
    <p>In May, he said he was with­draw­ing the US from the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) be­cause it was un­duly in­flu­enced by China.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron on Tues­day re­jected US de­mands for UN mem­bers to reim­pose in­ter­na­tional sanc­tions on Iran, ar­gu­ing that Amer­ica had for­feited the right to trig­ger such mea­sures when it with­drew from the nu­clear ac­cord in 2018.</p>
    <p>As Mr Macron de­liv­ered his blunt as­sess­ment of the tra­di­tional world or­der at the an­nual UN Gen­eral Assem­bly, he said peo­ple around the world had ex­pected lead­ers to co­op­er­ate and find so­lu­tions to the pan­demic, but that there had been a frac­tur­ing in­stead, in which key global bod­ies like the WHO were ac­cused by some of com­pla­cency and in­stru­men­talised by oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“Our or­gan­i­sa­tion it­self ran the risk of im­po­tency”, with per­ma­nent mem­bers not able to meet at the peak of the epi­demic “be­cause two of them pre­ferred to dis­play their ri­valry”, he said in a veiled jab at the US and China.</p>
    <p>“We can no longer be sat­is­fied with a mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism of words that only al­lows us to agree on the low­est com­mon de­nom­i­na­tor, a way of hid­ing deep di­ver­gences un­der a fa­cade of con­sen­sus.”</p>
    <p>In an­other sign of how frac­tured the mul­ti­lat­eral or­der has be­come, UN diplo­mats and hu­man rights ex­perts said US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo’s re­cent ef­forts to drum up sup­port at the UN for a new vi­sion of hu­man rights that pri­ori­tises re­li­gious lib­erty and prop­erty rights is be­ing met with great scep­ti­cism and lit­tle sup­port from Amer­ica’s Euro­pean al­lies.</p>
    <p>UN diplo­mats who spoke on con­di­tion of anonymity noted that Mr Pom­peo’s Com­mis­sion on Unalien­able Rights had drawn con­cern among Euro­pean na­tions for its heavy em­pha­sis on re­li­gion and for ad­vanc­ing a con­cept that there could be too many hu­man rights.</p>
    <p>Hu­man rights schol­ars have noted that the panel on Mr Pom­peo’s com­mis­sion is filled with con­ser­va­tives in­tent on pro­mot­ing views against abor­tion and mar­riage equal­ity. Ex­perts have said Mr Pom­peo’s de­sire to cre­ate a tiered set of hu­man rights with some rights get­ting pri­or­ity over oth­ers could set a global prece­dent for other na­tions look­ing to de­fine hu­man rights on their own terms.</p>
    <p>“It ex­poses how out of step the US ef­fort to uni­lat­er­ally de­fine hu­man rights is,” Duke Univer­sity law pro­fes­sor Jayne Huckerby said.</p>
    <p>“It’s re­ally ex­pos­ing the de­gree to which the US has moved away from global norms.”</p>
    <p>At the Gen­eral Assem­bly on Tues­day, Mr Trump fo­cused his speech on at­tack­ing China.</p>
    <p>The US Pres­i­dent, fac­ing a Novem­ber re-election bat­tle with his coun­try deal­ing with the world’s high­est num­ber of deaths and in­fec­tions from the coro­n­avirus, ac­cused Bei­jing of al­low­ing peo­ple to leave China in the early stages of the out­break to in­fect the world while shut­ting down do­mes­tic travel.</p>
    <p>“We must hold ac­count­able the na­tion which un­leashed this plague onto the world, China,” he said.</p>
    <p>China’s Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, in con­trast, struck a con­cil­ia­tory tone in his pre-recorded ad­dress, call­ing for greater co­op­er­a­tion over the pan­demic and stress­ing that Bei­jing has no in­ten­tion of fight­ing “ei­ther a Cold War or a hot war with any coun­try”.</p>
    <p>China’s UN am­bas­sador Zhang Jun re­jected Mr Trump’s ac­cu­sa­tions against China as “base­less” and said “lies re­peated a thou­sand times are still lies”.</p>
    <p>UN Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral An­to­nio Guter­res, in his speech to the assem­bly, seemed mind­ful of the threats to the in­ter­na­tional body posed by the rift be­tween the US and China.</p>
    <p>“We are mov­ing in a very dan­ger­ous di­rec­tion,” Mr Guter­res said.</p>
    <p>“Our world can­not af­ford a fu­ture where the two largest economies split the globe in a Great Frac­ture – each with its own trade and fi­nan­cial rules and In­ter­net and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence ca­pac­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>Such a di­vide, he added, “risks in­evitably turn­ing into a geostrate­gic and mil­i­tary di­vide. We must avoid this at all costs”.</p>
