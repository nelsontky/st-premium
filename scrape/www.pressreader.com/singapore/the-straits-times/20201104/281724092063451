    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON Tem­po­rary ex­tra fenc­ing has been erected around the White House, ply­wood af­fixed to store­fronts in Man­hat­tan and the Na­tional Guard put on no­tice in Port­land, Ore­gon, as US cities braced them­selves for pos­si­ble un­rest on election day.</p>
    <p>“We don’t see spe­cific re­ports or threats at this point,” New York Mayor Bill de Bla­sio told re­porters on Mon­day. “We are ready for all sorts of chal­lenges. A lot of prepa­ra­tion has been hap­pen­ing over the last few weeks and I’m meet­ing with city of­fi­cials to­day to con­tinue that prepa­ra­tion.”</p>
    <p>Most mid­town Man­hat­tan store­fronts have been boarded up on Fifth and Madi­son av­enues, though the mayor said the city had not ad­vised busi­nesses to take such steps.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar cal­cu­la­tions were be­ing made across the coun­try as a cam­paign marked by un­usual ran­cour and harsh rhetoric gives way to a fi­nal day of vot­ing – fol­lowed by a po­ten­tially long pe­riod of vote count­ing that will de­ter­mine if Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump re­ceives a sec­ond term or if Mr Joe Bi­den gets sworn in come Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>In Wash­ing­ton, a likely fo­cus for demon­stra­tions, shops and other busi­nesses lo­cated within sev­eral blocks of the White House al­ready closed their doors on Mon­day, with some plan­ning to stay shut­tered the rest of the week or longer.</p>
    <p>Nearly a dozen or­gan­ised protests, as­sem­blies and prayer vig­ils re­ceived per­mits from the Na­tional Park Ser­vice for or­gan­ised ac­tions this week. Mul­ti­ple per­mits have been filed with the city for large gath­er­ings as well, in­clud­ing an eight-hour demon­stra­tion with a giant dig­i­tal screen and live mu­sic sched­uled for election night that may draw thou­sands to the re­cently chris­tened Black Lives Mat­ter Plaza across a park from the White House.</p>
    <p>Un­sanc­tioned protests are al­most cer­tain, too, es­pe­cially in the wake of the death of Mr Karon Hyl­ton, a young black man who died in a crash on his moped while be­ing fol­lowed closely by a po­lice cruiser in the na­tional cap­i­tal on Oct 23.</p>
    <p>Se­cu­rity staff were erect­ing tem­po­rary fenc­ing around the White House and ad­ja­cent public grounds. City po­lice have closed dozens of blocks downtown, ef­fec­tive shortly after mid­night yes­ter­day through to­day, in­clud­ing around the Trump In­ter­na­tional Ho­tel.</p>
    <p>Some busi­nesses re­mained un­daunted. Ea­ton Work­shop – a ho­tel and co-work­ing space that has billed it­self as the “anti-Trump ho­tel” – said it would pro­vide paid time off for cast­ing bal­lots or vol­un­teer­ing at polling sites. “Our se­cu­rity team is fol­low­ing the pro­to­cols sug­gested by law en­force­ment and our op­er­at­ing hours and pro­ce­dures to­mor­row are the same,” said Mr Shel­don Scott, di­rec­tor of cul­ture for Ea­ton DC.</p>
    <p>A memo to fac­ulty and staff from lead­ers at Ge­orge Wash­ing­ton Univer­sity, which has a cam­pus lo­cated just blocks from the White House, sug­gested that peo­ple plan to bunker down: “We sug­gest pre­par­ing for the Election Day pe­riod as you would for a hur­ri­cane or a snow­storm,” the memo reads.</p>
    <p>In Ore­gon, Gov­er­nor Kate Brown on Mon­day is­sued an ex­ec­u­tive or­der for the Na­tional Guard to be de­ployed if lo­cal and state law en­force­ment agen­cies need help in</p>
    <p>Port­land, which has seen vi­o­lent clashes be­tween lo­cal demon­stra­tors and fed­eral au­thor­i­ties since early sum­mer.</p>
    <p>Law en­force­ment of­fi­cers will be au­tho­rised to use tear gas if neces</p>
    <p>sary. “I want to be very, very clear that voter in­tim­i­da­tion and po­lit­i­cal vi­o­lence will not be tol­er­ated – not from the left, not from the right, not from the cen­tre,” Ms Brown said.</p>
