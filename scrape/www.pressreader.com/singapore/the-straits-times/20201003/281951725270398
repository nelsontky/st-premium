    <p>Coro­n­avirus claimed its most high-pro­file vic­tim yet, with United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump now un­der quar­an­tine two days af­ter he ap­peared at a ruc­tious pres­i­den­tial de­bate with Demo­cratic ri­val Joe Bi­den. As leader of the world’s most pow­er­ful na­tion, which has re­ported the high­est num­ber of cases (over 7.2 mil­lion) and the most deaths (over 207,000), his ill­ness draws at­ten­tion not just to his own con­di­tion but also to his per­for­mance in com­bat­ing the pan­demic. He is not the first leader to have caught the virus – Brazil’s Pres­i­dent Jair Bol­sonaro and Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son are among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>But at 74, his age makes him vul­ner­a­ble to a se­vere form of the dis­ease. His ill­ness also has sig­nif­i­cant im­pli­ca­tions for the Nov 3 elec­tion. The US has not had an elec­tion in which a can­di­date be­came dis­abled or died af­ter be­ing nom­i­nated and be­fore tak­ing of­fice. While his Repub­li­can Party can sub­sti­tute a can­di­date if there is a need, it would be an added dis­rup­tion in an elec­tion al­ready fraught on many other counts, in­clud­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of a con­tested tran­si­tion. If his symp­toms are mild, he stages a quick re­cov­ery and of­fers the nar­ra­tive that he is a Covid-19 fighter, his sup­port could in­crease. This was the case with Mr Bol­sonaro, whose han­dling of the virus had been seen as in­ad­e­quate. Mr Trump’s sta­tus as a vic­tim could also prompt sym­pa­thy from the elec­torate and will re­quire Mr Bi­den to be con­strained in crit­i­cism of his op­po­nent.</p>
    <p>How­ever, while he re­mains in iso­la­tion, Mr Trump’s abil­ity to cam­paign may be cur­tailed in the cru­cial last weeks be­fore the elec­tion. It might keep Mr Bi­den, 77, from mak­ing pub­lic ap­pear­ances too, out of cau­tion for his own health. De­spite the ad­van­tages of in­cum­bency, Mr Trump has trailed Mr Bi­den in opinion polls, and his pug­na­cious per­for­mance in the pres­i­den­tial de­bate did not close the gap. His ill­ness might re­mind vot­ers of his con­tro­ver­sial, even cav­a­lier lead­er­ship dur­ing the cri­sis. He con­sis­tently down­played the out­break’s sever­ity – crit­ics say for po­lit­i­cal ad­van­tage – and dis­counted med­i­cal ad­vice on the im­por­tance of wear­ing masks. He has cam­paigned in bat­tle­ground states, ap­pear­ing at ral­lies with­out a mask while his crowds of sup­port­ers were usu­ally also with­out masks.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s han­dling of the out­break has been a cen­tral theme of the elec­tion cam­paign. His po­ten­tial to in­flu­ence minds and al­ter the course of the fight against the pan­demic is enor­mous. The bat­tle is now per­sonal, and presents him a chance to em­pathise with other vic­tims, re-eval­u­ate his at­ti­tude and re­think the ap­proach with which his ad­min­is­tra­tion han­dles the out­break go­ing for­ward. As the virus crests again, he can no longer deny its im­pact and must push for a de­ci­sive break­through in the fight against it. That could have a greater im­pact on his re-elec­tion bid.</p>
