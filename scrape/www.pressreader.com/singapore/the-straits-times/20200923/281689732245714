    <p>There is no need to ban im­ports from com­pa­nies whose frozen food prod­ucts have been con­tam­i­nated with the coro­n­avirus, say in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­perts.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause the risk of trans­mis­sion from a food source is very low, com­pared with the usual routes of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Even so, peo­ple in­volved in food prepa­ra­tion should ob­serve strict per­sonal hy­giene and en­sure that sur­faces and uten­sils are cleaned prop­erly.</p>
    <p>“I think the world should de­mand that food pro­cess­ing plants en­sure Covid-safe stan­dards,” said Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, a se­nior con­sul­tant at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal’s in­fec­tious dis­eases di­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>“On re­ceiv­ing food from over­seas, han­dlers should prac­tise reg­u­lar hand hy­giene and en­sure sur­faces and uten­sils are reg­u­larly cleaned.”</p>
    <p>He added that the main risk is to work­ers han­dling such food, not con­sumers. But even for work­ers, in­fec­tion through this route would still be “a very un­likely event”, said Prof Fisher.</p>
    <p>Said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Hsu Li Yang, pro­gramme leader of in­fec­tious dis­eases and co-di­rec­tor of global health at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health: “There should be no change from prior ad­vi­sories. Per­sonal hy­giene re­mains of crit­i­cal im­por­tance in food prepa­ra­tion, as there are many other dis­eases that one is more likely to ac­quire from food prepa­ra­tion and con­sump­tion, com­pared to Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>The is­sue has come un­der the spot­light in re­cent days, af­ter China an­nounced that it had found traces of the coro­n­avirus on the pack­ag­ing of frozen squid from Rus­sia and frozen fish from In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia has since sus­pended the com­pany, Putri In­dah, from ex­port­ing to China while it in­ves­ti­gates the is­sue.</p>
    <p>When asked if Putri In­dah ex­ports seafood prod­ucts to Sin­ga­pore, the Sin­ga­pore Food Agency (SFA) did not give a def­i­nite an­swer but re­ferred The Straits Times to its web­site.</p>
    <p>The site states that SFA is not aware of any ev­i­dence that sug­gests the virus can be trans­mit­ted via food, food pack­ag­ing or equip­ment used to han­dle food.</p>
    <p>The agency will con­tinue to mon­i­tor de­vel­op­ments closely, and take any ac­tion nec­es­sary to safe­guard food safety here.</p>
    <p>Dr Jas­min Lim, a lec­turer at Repub­lic Polytech­nic’s School of Ap­plied Sci­ence, said that seafood typ­i­cally goes through four stages in the sup­ply chain.</p>
    <p>It is first har­vested, then pro­cessed, be­fore be­ing pack­aged and put in cold stor­age. It is then trans­ported to distri­bu­tion cen­tres and, even­tu­ally, re­tail stores.</p>
    <p>De­pend­ing on how many steps there are in the sup­ply chain, food can change hands mul­ti­ple times, she added.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, a pro­ducer may sell to a lo­cal whole­saler, who then ex­ports this as raw ma­te­rial to be pro­cessed over­seas. This pro­ces­sor in turn sells to its own lo­cal dis­trib­u­tor.</p>
    <p>Prof Fisher said what is presently known is that the coro­n­avirus can sur­vive weeks when frozen or re­frig­er­ated at 4 deg C in a lab­o­ra­tory.</p>
    <p>Food pro­cess­ing plants have also been the sites of large Covid-19 clus­ters around the world, he added.</p>
    <p>“What is un­clear is whether virus that orig­i­nated in one coun­try was trans­ported and sur­vived at an ad­e­quate dose to cause in­fec­tion in peo­ple in China.”</p>
