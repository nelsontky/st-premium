    <p>Ex­er­cis­ing at parks is not just about keep­ing fit for Pana­sonic staff mem­ber Timothy Ng but also a chance for the 61-year-old to ap­pre­ci­ate the flora and fauna.</p>
    <p>To live life is to trea­sure all around him and that is why his com­pany’s slo­gan “A bet­ter life, a bet­ter world” res­onates strongly with him.</p>
    <p>“I use my time to go for things that will add value to my­self and the com­mu­nity,” said Ng.</p>
    <p>He vol­un­teers with the Sil­ver</p>
    <p>Gen­er­a­tion Of­fice to con­duct weekly or twice-weekly house vis­its for the el­derly, which restarted on Wed­nes­day after they were stopped tem­po­rar­ily due to the pan­demic. He also does grass­roots work and vis­its old folks’ homes with his church.</p>
    <p>De­spite his busy sched­ule, he makes the ef­fort to stay ac­tive, run­ning thrice a week when he can and opt­ing to walk to the mar­ket in­stead of tak­ing pub­lic trans­port.</p>
    <p>He has also taken part in three vir­tual runs this year, in­clud­ing The Straits Times Vir­tual Run’s 17.5km race, which he com­pleted on Oct 14. The race pe­riod for the 17.5km cat­e­gory is from Oct 9 till today. The in­au­gu­ral event is pre­sented by Pana­sonic.</p>
    <p>Ng split the dis­tance across six runs – one with a friend and the other five alone.</p>
    <p>He noted that com­plet­ing a vir­tual run re­quires more dis­ci­pline than tra­di­tional mass runs, so he kept him­self mo­ti­vated by look­ing for­ward to the meal or cold drink he would treat him­self to after the run.</p>
    <p>While he misses the at­mos­phere of tra­di­tional runs, he still en­joys the sense of achieve­ment that comes after fin­ish­ing vir­tual races.</p>
    <p>“At the sta­dium, there were so many booths around, there were even peo­ple who dressed up, so the at­mos­phere was there. So when you do a vir­tual run, that’s lack­ing,” said Ng, who took part in last year’s Straits Times Run.</p>
    <p>“But for vir­tual runs, you can al­ways do it with some friends or fam­ily, go to the park and en­joy the scenery. This is a pan­demic, it’s a dif­fer­ent time but that doesn’t mean it should keep us from ex­er­cis­ing.”</p>
