    <p>In a hill­side shan­ty­town of Lima, Peru, Delia Hua­mani’s school day starts not with the bus­tle of class­mates, but with the flicker of a tele­vi­sion set. With phys­i­cal schools closed in­def­i­nitely, she gets her les­sons at home, from the coun­try’s brand-new li­brary of slickly made ed­u­ca­tional broad­casts.</p>
    <p>As a sub­sti­tute, it’s far from per­fect. Delia, 10, says her par­ents can­not af­ford books – she misses read­ing about an­i­mals in the school li­brary – and she has no one to check her work.</p>
    <p>She leans on her friend Katy Bautista, 12, who wishes she could ask the tele­vi­sion pre­sen­ters to slow down dur­ing dif­fi­cult les­sons.</p>
    <p>“When we go to pick up food from the soup kitchen, we talk to each other and ex­plain things to one another,” Delia said of Katy re­cently. “Or some­times she ex­plains things to me; I don’t ex­plain any­thing. But she does, and that’s why she’s a good friend.”</p>
    <p>Yet for all its lim­i­ta­tions, tele­vised school­ing has one enor­mous ad­van­tage for Delia, Katy and many more of the one billion chil­dren world­wide who are shut out of schools by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic: It can reach them.</p>
    <p>In wealthy coun­tries, the de­bates over how to de­liver ed­u­ca­tion re­motely have fo­cused on how to make on­line classes en­gag­ing and in­ter­ac­tive. But such talk is sheer fan­tasy for many of the world’s stu­dents, in­clud­ing mil­lions in af­flu­ent na­tions, who do not have broadband con­nec­tions or com­put­ers.</p>
    <p>After decades of de­clin­ing rel­e­vance in the face of heavy in­vest­ment in In­ter­net learn­ing, ed­u­ca­tional tele­vi­sion is again hav­ing its mo­ment. Ed­u­ca­tors and gov­ern­ments scat­tered around the world, des­per­ate to avoid a long-term set­back for an en­tire gen­er­a­tion of chil­dren, are turn­ing to the older tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>And they are call­ing on the charm and glam­our of lo­cally known ac­tors and news hosts, as well as teach­ers, to try to hold the at­ten­tion of stu­dents from pre-school to high school. They say they are heed­ing the car­di­nal l es­son of the YouTube era – the shorter and snazz­ier, the bet­ter.</p>
    <p>“Ide­ally, one would have, like, lap­tops and all these su­per fancy things at home,” said Dr Raissa Fabre­gas, a pro­fes­sor of eco­nom­ics and pub­lic af­fairs at the Univer­sity of Texas at Austin, who has stud­ied ed­u­ca­tional tele­vi­sion in Mex­ico. “But if you don’t have them, this is bet­ter than noth­ing.”</p>
    <p>While tele­vi­sion les­sons are not as valu­able as on­line in­ter­ac­tions with teach­ers and other stu­dents, ex­perts say, ed­u­ca­tional broad­casts do pay div­i­dends for chil­dren’s aca­demic progress, their suc­cess in the job mar­ket and even their so­cial de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>To make les­sons less pas­sive and more ef­fec­tive, many of the les­sons be­ing broad­cast now use all the tools of pro­fes­sional stu­dios, like eye-pleas­ing sets, scriptwrit­ers, 3D an­i­ma­tion, mul­ti­cam­era shoots, graph­ics and even re­lated smart­phone apps.</p>
    <p>In the United States, where ed­u­ca­tion varies widely be­cause it is han­dled at the lo­cal level, some places have paid lit­tle at­ten­tion to de­vel­op­ing re­mote learn­ing, fo­cused in­stead on an ill-fated ef­fort to re­open schools. Oth­ers have worked hard to de­velop ro­bust on­line pro­grammes. But that is of no use to the four mil­lion school­child­ren who do not have In­ter­net ac­cess at home, a dif­fi­culty es­pe­cially preva­lent among black, Latino and In­dige­nous stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Tele­vi­sion holds prom­ise as a low-cost com­ple­ment to on­line school­ing and a life­line for stu­dents with few other re­sources. A vast cat­a­logue of ed­u­ca­tional pro­gram­ming ex­ists, but an­a­lysts say pol­i­cy­mak­ers have mostly missed an op­por­tu­nity to make use of it.</p>
    <p>“How many par­ents right now are just try­ing to fig­ure out how to get through the day, while their kids are just watch­ing TV or on the iPad?” said Dr Melissa S. Kear­ney, a pro­fes­sor of eco­nom­ics at the Univer­sity of Mary­land, who has pub­lished re­search about Se­same Street. “We could do a lot of good if peo­ple who are in a po­si­tion of trust with those fam­i­lies could point them to some of that pos­i­tive con­tent.”</p>
    <p>Since March, many parts of the world have re­sorted to tele­vised school­ing, with an ar­ray of strate­gies. The pro­grammes range from record­ings of class­room les­sons to ed­u­ca­tional car­toons, and from lo­cal ef­forts to na­tional ones. Some fo­cus on one age group, while oth­ers, like Peru, have adapted the na­tional cur­ricu­lum for all grades.</p>
    <p>Many parts of China of­fered a blend of on­line and tele­vised classes, but Sichuan prov­ince chose to broad­cast all of its les­sons on tele­vi­sion be­cause the gov­ern­ment said it wor­ried about stu­dents spend­ing long hours on their com­put­ers.</p>
    <p>In Tan­za­nia, Ubongo, an or­gan­i­sa­tion that makes pop­u­lar ed­u­ca­tional car­toons aimed at younger chil­dren as well as par­ents, de­cided to of­fer its pro­grammes for free to tele­vi­sion sta­tions across Africa.</p>
    <p>“Out­side of Africa, there’s been a push for In­ter­net-based learn­ing,” said Ms Cliodhna Ryan, head of ed­u­ca­tion at Ubongo. “But in most African coun­tries, the ma­jor­ity of chil­dren just do not have that ac­cess. At the end of the day, the best ed­u­ca­tional tool some­one has is the one they al­ready have in their pos­ses­sion.”</p>
    <p>New Jersey’s pub­lic tele­vi­sion sta­tion, NJTV, be­gan work­ing with the state’s teach­ers’ union to pro­duce school pro­grammes after learn­ing that 300,000 of the state’s chil­dren had no In­ter­net ac­cess, said Mr John Ser­vidio, the sta­tion’s gen­eral man­ager.</p>
    <p>In the end, more than 200 teach­ers recorded les­sons out of their own homes. Some were de­cid­edly low-tech, but one teacher used his cat’s blan­ket to build a green-screen stu­dio. From April un­til the school year ended, grades three to six each had an hour of pro­gram­ming on the sta­tion every morning.</p>
    <p>“A com­mer­cial sta­tion would never be able to sup­port this,” Mr Ser­vidio said.</p>
    <p>In In­done­sia, too, the pan­demic has helped re­vive a state-owned tele­vi­sion net­work, TVRI. In a coun­try where nearly a third of peo­ple are not con­nected to the In­ter­net, TVRI be­gan broad­cast­ing Be­la­jar Dari Rumah – Study­ing From Home – in April to chil­dren of all ages.</p>
    <p>Par­ents have not been en­tirely re­cep­tive. Many In­done­sians, for ex­am­ple, say they do not have enough ed­u­ca­tion them­selves – or enough time – to take on teach­ing re­spon­si­bil­i­ties at home. Many are de­mand­ing that more schools re­open, de­spite only a por­tion of the coun­try hav­ing been deemed safe for in-per­son classes.</p>
    <p>In Brazil, of­fi­cials cap­i­talised on the work of the Ama­zonas Me­dia Cen­tre, which was founded in 2007 to pro­vide tele­vised les­sons to 300,000 stu­dents in re­mote ar­eas. Since the coro­n­avirus pan­demic took hold, the pro­grammes have ex­panded to sev­eral Brazil­ian states, with ed­u­ca­tors adapt­ing them to dif­fer­ent cul­tures and teach­ing styles. More than 4.5 mil­lion chil­dren have watched, ac­cord­ing to the cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“This tool be­came stronger out of a ne­ces­sity to reach a greater num­ber of peo­ple and have a big­ger out­reach, but it’s not go­ing to stop there,” said Ms Wil­mara Messa, di­rec­tor of the Ama­zonas Me­dia Cen­tre, which has a 60-per­son pro­duc­tion team.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say it is too early to know how ef­fec­tive tele­vised school­ing has been dur­ing a lock­down, but there is scat­tered ev­i­dence that past ef­forts have been ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>In Mex­ico, a long-run­ning pro­gramme of broad­cast­ing les­sons to stu­dents in ru­ral ar­eas led chil­dren to stay in school for longer and earn more as adults. Dr Kear­ney and a col­league found that chil­dren in the US with ac­cess to Se­same Street pro­gram­ming were more likely to be at an age-ap­pro­pri­ate grade level.</p>
    <p>To solve the biggest draw­back of tele­vised learn­ing – the lack of in­ter­ac­tion and feed­back from teach­ers – some places have de­signed ways for teach­ers to mon­i­tor stu­dents’ progress. Many of them rely on cell­phones, which are far more com­mon in poor re­gions of the world than broadband hook-ups, though even ac­cess to a phone can be a bar­rier.</p>
    <p>The state of Ama­zonas, in Brazil, of­fers a smart­phone app to sup­ple­ment tele­vised school­ing, al­low­ing stu­dents to ask their teach­ers ques­tions in real time.</p>
    <p>“The stu­dents watch the TV, and we have one teacher on-screen and another one off to the side me­di­at­ing the com­ments that come in through the chat room,” said Ms Sab­rina Emanuela de Melo Araujo, a high school bi­ol­ogy teacher.</p>
    <p>Ubongo, the Tan­za­nia-based car­toon maker, has paired its pro­grammes with a smart­phone app of­fer­ing sup­port to par­ents and stu­dents. And teach­ers and stu­dents around the world use mes­sag­ing ser­vices like What­sApp to stay in con­tact.</p>
    <p>Peru, a poor na­tion of 32 mil­lion peo­ple, has suf­fered one of the world’s worst coro­n­avirus out­breaks, with an of­fi­cial count of more than 500,000 cases and 25,000 deaths – fig­ures that ex­perts say do not cap­ture the true toll.</p>
    <p>In a coun­try where only 15 per cent of pub­lic school stu­dents have ac­cess to a com­puter at home, broad­cast les­sons have be­come the dom­i­nant mode of learn­ing dur­ing the pan­demic. In a gov­ern­ment sur­vey in June, three-quar­ters of par­ents said their chil­dren used the tele­vised pro­grammes com­pared with a quar­ter who used the gov­ern­ment’s ed­u­ca­tional web­site. Nearly all sent home­work to teach­ers through What­sApp.</p>
    <p>Early broad­casts ad­dressed virus-re­lated top­ics like good hy­giene and avoid­ing dis­in­for­ma­tion. More re­cent ones have com­bined tra­di­tional les­sons with made-fortele­vi­sion twists: For a high school maths class, a real teacher calls in to cor­rect a pre­sen­ter’s faulty grasp of sta­tis­tics.</p>
    <p>“It’s ad­van­ta­geous for stu­dents who know how to learn on their own,” said Mr Heli Estela, a high school teacher in the An­dean re­gion of Ca­ja­marca in north­ern Peru. “And we have stu­dents like that, with ini­tia­tive, who fig­ure it out on their own. But there aren’t many of them.”</p>
    <p>He has seen the ef­fort stum­ble, re­peat­edly. Early in the pan­demic, he said, he paid his In­ter­net provider more than US$100 (S$137) to in­stall an an­tenna be­cause his own con­nec­tion was so slow.</p>
    <p>Mr Estela mes­sages stu­dents over What­sApp to sup­ple­ment tele­vi­sion and ra­dio les­sons, but try­ing to ex­plain con­cepts in­di­vid­u­ally has been dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>In a district where many par­ents are sub­sis­tence farm­ers, some of his 47 stu­dents have lost ac­cess to tele­vi­sion when their fam­i­lies had to move around the coun­try­side for work. A dozen have failed to re­port back at all. Oth­ers seem to be cheat­ing on their home­work.</p>
    <p>“To really start re­mote ed­u­ca­tion, first you have to make sure every­one has In­ter­net,” he said, “but this dis­ease didn’t give us any warn­ing.”</p>
    <p>In Peru, of­fi­cials first de­vel­oped ed­u­ca­tional broad­casts i n the 1960s; Mr Sal­vador Heren­cia, the tech­ni­cal sec­re­tary of In­vest­ment in Child­hood, a civil so­ci­ety group, re­mem­bers lis­ten­ing to les­sons on the ra­dio as a child. He later worked for the na­tional tele-ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem, be­com­ing part of a gen­er­a­tion of ed­u­ca­tors and writ­ers who con­trib­uted con­tent as a way of ex­tend­ing school­ing to poor Peru­vians.</p>
    <p>But the pro­grammes pe­tered out dur­ing eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal crises in the 1980s, with the state tak­ing a back seat to busi­nesses in the cre­ation of ed­u­ca­tional pro­gram­ming. Now Peru, after cob­bling to­gether ex­ist­ing pro­grammes from Mex­ico and Ar­gentina at the start of the pan­demic, has re­built its own tele­vised ed­u­ca­tional sys­tem from scratch.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has said tele­vised les­sons will re­main an in­te­gral part of its ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem, with the Prime Min­is­ter promis­ing that the “strat­egy is here to stay”.</p>
    <p>“It’s back to the fu­ture, re­turn­ing to some­thing that we knew we had to do, and that was in­ter­rupted,” Mr Heren­cia said. “It was cut off. But that con­ver­sa­tion and that pas­sion is still with us.”</p>
    <p>After decades of de­clin­ing rel­e­vance in the face of heavy in­vest­ment in In­ter­net learn­ing, ed­u­ca­tional tele­vi­sion is again hav­ing its mo­ment. Ed­u­ca­tors and gov­ern­ments scat­tered around the world, des­per­ate to avoid a long-term set­back for an en­tire gen­er­a­tion of chil­dren, are turn­ing to the older tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Since March, many parts of the world have re­sorted to tele­vised school­ing, with an ar­ray of strate­gies. The pro­grammes range from record­ings of class­room les­sons to ed­u­ca­tional car­toons, and from lo­cal ef­forts to na­tional ones.</p>
