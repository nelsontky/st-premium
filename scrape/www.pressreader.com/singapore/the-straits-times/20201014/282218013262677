    <p>China’s south­ern mega-city of Shen­zhen will use the cen­tral bank’s new dig­i­tal yuan to pro­vide 10 mil­lion yuan (S$2 mil­lion) of coupons to res­i­dents as part of on­go­ing pi­lot pro­grammes to test the vir­tual cur­rency, in a sign that it is ap­proach­ing wide­spread roll-out.</p>
    <p>The lo­cal gov­ern­ment of Shen­zhen’s Luohu dis­trict will give res­i­dents 50,000 dig­i­tal coupons of 200 yuan each, which they can spend from Oct 12 to 18 in nearly 3,400 des­ig­nated shops that can ac­cept dig­i­tal yuan pay­ments, rang­ing from su­per­mar­kets to con­ve­nience stores to petrol sta­tions.</p>
    <p>The con­sump­tion stim­u­lus pro­gramme is the lat­est move to ex­pand tri­als of the dig­i­tal cur­rency, which has been un­der devel­op­ment by China’s cen­tral bank since 2014. Ear­lier in April, the cen­tral bank con­firmed it was con­duct­ing in­ter­nal tri­als of the dig­i­tal cur­rency in four re­gions, in­clud­ing Shen­zhen, and in hy­po­thet­i­cal sce­nar­ios re­lated to the 2022 Win­ter Olympics in Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Those pi­lots have made “pos­i­tive progress”, Mr Fan Yifei, a deputy gov­er­nor of the Peo­ple’s Bank of China (PBOC), said on Mon­day at Si­bos 2020, a global fi­nan­cial ser­vices net­work­ing con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>As of late Au­gust, the PBOC had pro­cessed over three mil­lion trans­ac­tions worth 1.1 bil­lion yuan us­ing its dig­i­tal cur­rency, said Mr Fan.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral bank has tested more than 6,700 use cases in var­i­ous in­dus­tries, he added, not­ing that trans­ac­tions could be done via dif­fer­ent meth­ods, in­clud­ing bar­code scan­ning and fa­cial recog­ni­tion.</p>
    <p>The PBOC re­gards the dig­i­tal yuan as an im­por­tant fi­nan­cial in­fra­struc­ture for the fu­ture, said Mr Fan.</p>
    <p>Six of China’s largest sta­te­owned banks have joined a pi­lot pro­gramme to cre­ate ser­vices for the dig­i­tal yuan and con­duct tests.</p>
    <p>With the dig­i­tal cur­rency de­signed to re­place some phys­i­cal cash in cir­cu­la­tion, Chi­nese lenders are test­ing it in real-life pay­ment sce­nar­ios with the help of the coun­try’s In­ter­net gi­ants, sources told Caixin.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with third-party pay­ment meth­ods, the dig­i­tal yuan can bet­ter pro­tect con­sumers’ per­sonal in­for­ma­tion and be cheaper for mer­chants. But it may be dif­fi­cult for it to com­pete with en­trenched ser­vices like Ali­pay and WeChat Pay, said Mr Chen Wen, direc­tor of South­west­ern Univer­sity of Fi­nance and Eco­nom­ics’ dig­i­tal econ­omy re­search cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“The key is to en­cour­age con­sumers to use the dig­i­tal yuan.”</p>
