    <p>Af­ter Robin­sons an­nounced yes­ter­day morn­ing that it will close its last two stores here at The Heeren and Raf­fles City Shop­ping Cen­tre, shop­pers flocked to the out­lets, with no cer­tainty on when the shut­ters will even­tu­ally come down.</p>
    <p>Some shop­pers like house­wife Suyan Hong, 48, were “to­tally stunned” when told the news.</p>
    <p>“I knew that they were down­siz­ing af­ter they an­nounced the clo­sure of their (Jem) out­let. But usu­ally when down­siz­ing hap­pens, it is a cost-cut­ting mea­sure that will help the busi­ness’ mar­gins im­prove. I didn’t ex­pect them to shut down,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I will miss the spon­ta­neous ex­pe­ri­ence of be­ing able to find any­thing from clothes to home­ware and chil­dren’s items in one place at</p>
    <p>Robin­sons. Robin­sons is where I would go for last-minute shop­ping dur­ing the hol­i­day sea­son.”</p>
    <p>Robin­sons closed its Jem out­let in Jurong East in the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>A snaking queue moved briskly out­side The Heeren store when The Straits Times vis­ited at 3pm, with about 20 peo­ple safely dis­tanced in line. As many as 25 peo­ple queued to try on clothes at one fit­ting room.</p>
    <p>At the Raf­fles City store, a queue of about 15 peo­ple could be seen at the cashier. A few cus­tomers were also seen with lug­gage at Raf­fles City Shop­ping Cen­tre to stow away their depart­ment store pur­chases.</p>
    <p>Many of the shop­pers who thronged both out­lets were mid­dleaged, and some had young chil­dren in tow. A num­ber of se­nior cit­i­zens were spot­ted in the crowd as well.</p>
    <p>Sales pro­mot­ers from re­tail­ers in­clud­ing Hush Pup­pies and Sam­sonite were seen pack­ing up their goods to send back to ware­houses af­ter they were told to do so by the brands that hired them.</p>
    <p>Some shop­pers said they saw the writ­ing on the wall for Robin­sons.</p>
    <p>Ms Michelle Khoo, 34, who works in the e-com­merce in­dus­try, said depart­ment stores such as Robin­sons are past their prime. “Dur­ing our par­ents’ time, depart­ment stores would be the first places they would shop at. But now, there are so many av­enues – go­ing on­line would be my first choice,” she said.</p>
    <p>Many shop­pers like Mrs M. Sidhu, who is in her late 50s, were sad to learn of the clo­sures. Mrs Sidhu said Robin­sons re­minds her two adult chil­dren, who are in their 20s, of their child­hood.</p>
    <p>“Robin­sons used to be at The Cen­tre­point with Marks & Spencer. Dur­ing Christ­mas, the whole area would be lit up and we would go shop­ping as a fam­ily,” she said.</p>
