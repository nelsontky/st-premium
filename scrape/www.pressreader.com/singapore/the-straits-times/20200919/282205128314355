    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX) is in a fierce com­pe­ti­tion to re­tain its dom­i­nance in de­riv­a­tives trade, its top rev­enue earner.</p>
    <p>It has lined up new prod­ucts across dif­fer­ent as­set classes in re­cent months to re­in­force the divi­sion, a move sparked by MSCI’s de­ci­sion in May to shift li­cens­ing for most of its in­dexes’ de­riv­a­tives from here to Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The tran­si­tion will be ef­fec­tive in Fe­bru­ary, leav­ing be­hind only Sin­ga­pore-linked gauges with the SGX. The bourse’s other largest eq­uity in­dex de­riv­a­tive prod­ucts which track the FTSE China A50 In­dex and Ja­pan’s Nikkei 225 In­dex will not be af­fected by the li­cence ex­pi­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, SGX’s stock nose­dived – af­ter the MSCI de­ci­sion – by the most in a decade, re­flect­ing the hit on in­vestor con­fi­dence. The shares have re­cov­ered most of the losses but the stakes for the bourse are high.</p>
    <p>Pas­sive man­age­ment as an in­vest­ing strat­egy has seen tremen­dous growth in the past few years. Most in­vestors now seek a de­riv­a­tive that tracks a mar­ket-weighted in­dex like the MSCI or FTSE in­dexes, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>The SGX’s de­riv­a­tives busi­ness ac­counts for about half its rev­enue, higher than that for Aus­tralia, Hong Kong or Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Con­tri­bu­tion from de­riv­a­tives trad­ing to over­all turnover has in­creased sharply over the past decade – up from around 21 per cent in 2010 to 50 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>De­riv­a­tives rev­enue ac­counted for about 36 per cent of the to­tal for the ASX in Aus­tralia; 27 per cent at HKEX, the Hong Kong bourse; and 18 per cent for Bursa Malaysia last year.</p>
    <p>SGX guid­ance in May was of a drop of 10 per cent to 15 per cent in rev­enue, as­sum­ing no cash stream from the MSCI busi­ness.</p>
    <p>How­ever, chief ex­ec­u­tive Loh</p>
    <p>Boon Chye told The Straits Times that the es­ti­mate was a “con­ser­va­tive” one and did not ac­count for mit­i­gat­ing mea­sures the SGX will have in place by Fe­bru­ary. These in­clude last month’s launch of fu­tures con­tracts on in­dexes of real es­tate in­vest­ment trusts (Reits) across Asia, ex­clud­ing Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>The FTSE EPRA Nareit Asia ex-Ja­pan Reits In­dex is tracked by US$340 bil­lion (S$461 bil­lion) of as­sets un­der man­age­ment, and will com­ple­ment its iEdge S-Reit Lead­ers In­dex.</p>
    <p>The SGX part­nered with the</p>
    <p>FTSE Group to launch Tai­wan fu­tures in July, af­ter in­tro­duc­ing sin­gle-stock fu­tures on its plat­form in June.</p>
    <p>It also an­nounced plans to launch bench­mark eq­uity de­riv­a­tives this month – a to­tal of 13 new Asia ex-Ja­pan and Emerg­ing Mar­kets Asia re­gional and sin­gle-coun­try fu­tures based on Net To­tal Re­turn and Price Re­turn in­dexes cal­cu­lated by FTSE Rus­sell.</p>
    <p>Like most bourses, the in­her­ent risks to SGX earn­ings are its re­liance on mar­ket vol­umes and cap­i­tal mar­ket ac­tiv­i­ties, which are sen­ti­ment-driven and in­flu­enced by the di­rec­tion of for­eign fund flows. The mar­ket volatil­ity amid the Covid-19 out­break helped the SGX cross the $1 bil­lion rev­enue mark for the first time in the 2020 fi­nan­cial year, which ended on June 30, as higher vol­umes boosted trans­ac­tion-pro­cess­ing fees.</p>
    <p>But bet­ting on wild swings in trad­ing vol­umes is un­sus­tain­able.</p>
    <p>SGX’s cash eq­uity busi­ness has not done as well as the de­riv­a­tives trade. It de­rived about 21 per cent of to­tal rev­enue from the se­cu­ri­ties seg­ment in the 2020 fi­nan­cial year, down from 46 per cent in 2010.</p>
    <p>Av­er­age daily turnover for the seg­ment has been hov­er­ing slightly above the $1 bil­lion mark in the last few years, down from a peak of about $1.5 bil­lion in 2010.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of listed com­pa­nies has dropped in the past few years. It stood at 710 last month, down from 771 in Au­gust 2015.</p>
    <p>So the in­sti­tu­tional-driven de­riv­a­tives busi­ness has be­come the key growth driver in re­cent years. Rev­enue from de­riv­a­tives over­took the se­cu­ri­ties seg­ment in the first quar­ter of 2015, said DBS Bank an­a­lyst Lim Rui Wen. “We ex­pect this trend to per­sist as SGX con­tin­ues to in­tro­duce more de­riv­a­tives prod­ucts,” she added.</p>
    <p>But the loss of MSCI in­dexes to Hong Kong shows that the SGX can­not main­tain its de­riv­a­tives ad­van­tage with­out a fight.</p>
    <p>It may see an­other round of spec­u­la­tive sell-off in the light of HKEX plans to launch fu­tures con­tracts on China A shares.</p>
    <p>These may com­pete with the SGX’s FTSE China A50 In­dex Fu­tures, which ac­counts for about 40 per cent of to­tal de­riv­a­tives vol­ume.</p>
    <p>The top four in­dex fu­tures – FTSE China A50, Nikkei 225, SGX CNX Nifty and MSCI Tai­wan – ac­counted for about 70 per cent of the to­tal monthly vol­ume in the de­riv­a­tives mar­ket for cal­en­dar year 2019.</p>
    <p>De­spite the loss of most of its MSCI prod­ucts, the SGX’s de­riv­a­tives rev­enue from other con­tracts should stay re­silient.</p>
    <p>Its cur­rency fu­tures’ vol­ume surged 38 per cent year on year in the four months to April 30 while eq­uity in­dex fu­tures – ex­clud­ing MSCI con­tracts that will be dis­con­tin­ued – jumped 8 per cent. The in­crease was led by its Nikkei 225 In­dex fu­tures, which surged 69 per cent.</p>
    <p>Grow­ing in­clu­sion of A shares in global bench­marks and open­ing up of China to for­eign in­vestors should fuel hedg­ing needs as their as­set al­lo­ca­tion to the coun­try in­creases.</p>
    <p>This has been ev­i­dent in the rapid growth of SGX’s China-re­lated de­riv­a­tives prod­ucts over the past three years. Trad­ing vol­ume of its FTSE China A50 In­dex fu­tures climbed 20 per cent while US dol­lar-off­shore yuan ex­change rate con­tracts surged on av­er­age 118 per cent a year from 2017 to last year.</p>
    <p>An earn­ings boost is also ex­pected from its fixed in­come, cur­ren­cies and com­modi­ties of­fer­ings. Ms Carmen Lee of OCBC In­vest­ment Re­search said the SGX plans to con­tinue grow­ing this seg­ment. A BidFX ac­qui­si­tion in July will help lift cur­rency de­riv­a­tives’ trad­ing vol­umes, she added.</p>
    <p>Within the com­modi­ties busi­ness, trade in the SGX’s iron-ore con­tracts has in­creased at an im­pres­sive pace. The iron-ore con­tract is now seen as a bench­mark, com­pa­ra­ble to other SGX bench­marks such as rub­ber and freight, Ms Lee noted.</p>
