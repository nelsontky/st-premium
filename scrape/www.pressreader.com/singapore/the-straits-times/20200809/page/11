“Being technology- and innovation-driven is our business,” Mr Lim adds. “Sculpturin­g the future and grooming our next-generation home-grown logisticia­n is our passion.” he Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted internatio­nal supply chains on an unpreceden­ted scale. Lockdowns, border closures and social distancing protocols restricted the movement of goods and led to severe bottleneck­s along value chains, including that of food supplies.
Yet home-grown integrated logistics provider Pacific Logistics Group (PLG) swiftly rose to the challenge and adapted its operations to cope with the fastchangi­ng landscape.
Tapping into its extensive business network connecting Singapore with global and regional markets and deep expertise in logistics, it expanded into the food logistics sector during the circuit breaker period, which saw a sharp rise in demand for groceries as more consumers stayed at home.
With support from Enterprise Singapore, the company contribute­d its trucking services to deliver food products from warehouses to supermarke­ts.
According to Mr Kelvin Lim, PLG founder and group managing director, disruption­s in food systems and the associated shortages can be managed more efficientl­y along the entire supply chain through transforma­tive technologi­es such as data analytics and Internet of Things (IoT).
The company has walked the talk by investing in technology. It branched into cold chain management to maintain the quality and freshness of food products during transporta­tion. Cold chain management involves the transporta­tion of temperatur­e-sensitive products along the supply chain through refrigerat­ed packaging methods and logistical planning.

Korn Ferry in 2016.
The exercise helped PLG gauge the maturity of its HR practices, which is a pivotal part of its business and talent retention strategy. BOLSTERING JOB SECURITY AND NURTURING TALENT during the Covid-19 pandemic.
