    <p>Dis­ap­pointed she could not en­joy af­ter-din­ner drinks with her col­leagues and clients due to the pan­demic, Ence Mar­ket­ing Group manag­ing direc­tor An­gela Sim de­cided to in­stall a beer keg in her of­fice late last year.</p>
    <p>Lit­tle did she ex­pect to be­come fast friends with the man in­stalling the keg, Mr An­drew Wee.</p>
    <p>To­day, they are so close that she has even rid­den pil­lion on his Har­ley-David­son mo­tor­cy­cle.</p>
    <p>Although din­ing in was al­lowed with the start of Phase 2 in June last year, restau­rants had strict ca­pac­ity guide­lines.</p>
    <p>Ms Sim, who is 44 and a Sin­ga­porean, found it dif­fi­cult to find places where she could en­joy happy hour with her busi­ness as­so­ciates with­out prior reser­va­tions.</p>
    <p>Around that time, Mr Wee, 69, the for­mer owner of the Moa Tiki New Zealand Bar & Grill restau­rants, had just closed both out­lets at Changi City Point and Chi­jmes, and was look­ing to cre­ate a new di­rec­tion for his wine and beer busi­ness.</p>
    <p>He con­tacted Ms Sim, ask­ing if she wanted to buy a 20-litre keg of Moa orig­i­nal lager.</p>
    <p>She jumped at the chance and he in­stalled a keg and a “kegera­tor” – a fridge that can keep beer cold and dis­pense it – at her of­fice in Raf­fles Place.</p>
    <p>The beer ran out faster than ex­pected and she soon bought a sec­ond keg, then a third.</p>
    <p>Each time, Mr Wee in­stalled the keg. Ms Sim found him to be jovial, with a great sense of hu­mour.</p>
    <p>Like her, he was an en­tre­pre­neur; they hit it off.</p>
    <p>“It was very un­ex­pected how our friend­ship started,” she re­calls.</p>
    <p>“I ate at An­drew’s restau­rant four years ago, and met him once at a busi­ness event. I had his name card for three years. But it was only dur­ing Covid-19 that our friend­ship blos­somed.</p>
    <p>“I treat him as a men­tor, given his vast ex­pe­ri­ence in en­trepreneur­ship and the cor­po­rate world. I have bounced sev­eral busi­ness ideas off him and his frank opin­ion has been in­valu­able.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wee, a Singapore per­ma­nent res­i­dent who grew up in Malaysia, says: “I love meet­ing new people. Af­ter all, strangers are friends of the fu­ture. I also like learn­ing about new ideas and how young people do busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>Since Oc­to­ber, he has joined Ms Sim’s of­fice drinks and net­work­ing ses­sions ev­ery week.</p>
    <p>She has pur­chased nine kegs of beer from him al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing one ses­sion, Ms Sim dis­cov­ered Mr Wee had a Har­leyDavid­son mo­tor­cy­cle, which he rode fre­quently with other bik­ers. He asked if she wanted to come along for a ride. She was game.</p>
    <p>On Nov 28, to­gether with 25 other Har­ley own­ers, the two rode from Changi Beach Park to Prin­sep Street, with Ms Sim rid­ing pil­lion.</p>
    <p>“It was ex­hil­a­rat­ing, with revving en­gine sounds, the wind in my face and ev­ery­one rid­ing as a group,” she re­calls.</p>
    <p>“It was my first time on a Har­ley and I hope it won’t be my last.”</p>
    <p>Ms Sim has met Mr Wee’s wife, Ms Au­drey Chua, 59, and the two women are now col­lab­o­rat­ing on a vir­tual mall busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Mr Wee has four grown-up chil­dren, while Ms Sim is in a re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>She says: “I am glad that amid the gloom of the pan­demic, at least I made a new friend.”</p>
