    <p>Num­ber of peo­ple in­fected world­wide, with more than</p>
    <p>1.2 mil­lion deaths.</p>
    <p>FLOUTING LOCK­DOWN RULES</p>
    <p>It’s un­bear­able for those who re­spect the rules to see other French peo­ple flouting them. There is an at­ti­tude of what will be will be. We need to take all the steps needed to fight the epi­demic.</p>
    <p>FRENCH GOV­ERN­MENT SPOKESMAN GABRIEL AT­TAL, on how many peo­ple are ig­nor­ing the new lock­down.</p>
    <p>VI­ENNA • Austria and Greece yes­ter­day be­came the lat­est Euro­pean na­tions to im­pose curbs to com­bat the coro­n­avirus surge, with a deadly ter­ror­ist at­tack in Vi­enna ahead of a par­tial lock­down com­pound­ing the mis­ery.</p>
    <p>The virus has in­fected over 46 mil­lion peo­ple world­wide, with more than 1.2 mil­lion deaths, and the acute out­breaks in Europe and Amer­ica are spark­ing fur­ther alarm about the state of the al­ready dev­as­tated global economy.</p>
    <p>Austria’s cases in re­cent weeks have surged well past the lev­els recorded in spring, forc­ing the gov­ern­ment to im­pose a cur­few be­tween 8pm and 6am from yes­ter­day un­til the end of the month.</p>
    <p>Chan­cel­lor Se­bas­tian Kurz had an­nounced the mea­sures last Satur­day, de­scrib­ing them as “dra­matic in­ter­ven­tions in our so­cial life”.</p>
    <p>No meet­ings will be al­lowed be­tween peo­ple from more than two house­holds, and there will be lim­ited cur­few ex­cep­tions for care re­spon­si­bil­i­ties and es­sen­tial work travel. Uni­ver­si­ties and high schools will move to dis­tance learn­ing, but kinder­gartens and other schools will re­main open.</p>
    <p>A two-week lock­down was also due to come into force yes­ter­day in</p>
    <p>Greece’s sec­ond-big­gest city Thes­sa­loniki, with flights suspended and ev­ery­thing closed ex­cept schools. The re­stric­tions fol­low lo­calised lock­downs in the re­gions of Kozani and Kas­to­ria last month .</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 cri­sis has deep­ened in Europe in re­cent weeks, with health ex­perts warning that the spikes in in­fec­tions could over­whelm healthcare in­fra­struc­ture across the con­ti­nent.</p>
    <p>To curb the spike in Ger­many, Europe’s big­gest economy, Chan­cel</p>
    <p>lor An­gela Merkel ap­pealed to cit­i­zens to help achieve a “turn­around” by re­spect­ing a new round of shut­downs from Mon­day un­til the end of the month.</p>
    <p>Much of Por­tu­gal also faces a lock­down from to­day while</p>
    <p>France, hav­ing im­posed its sec­ond shut­down last week, is also pre­par­ing to fur­ther tighten re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Eng­land will be­gin a new lock­down to­mor­row, bring­ing it in line with other parts of Britain and Europe.</p>
    <p>France could reim­pose a night cur­few on Paris, and pos­si­bly the Ile-de-France re­gion around the cap­i­tal, amid gov­ern­ment frus­tra­tion that too many peo­ple are ig­nor­ing the new lock­down.</p>
    <p>The coun­try dra­mat­i­cally slowed the spread of the virus in spring with one of Europe’s most dra­co­nian lock­downs. But 10 months into the pan­demic and with win­ter draw­ing near, many are re­luc­tant to en­dure another pe­riod of con­fine­ment.</p>
    <p>“It’s un­bear­able for those who re­spect the rules to see other French peo­ple flouting them,” gov­ern­ment spokesman Gabriel At­tal told BFM TV. “There is an at­ti­tude of what will be will be. We need to take all the steps needed to fight the epi­demic.”</p>
    <p>He pre­sented the new cur­few as a fait ac­com­pli but the of­fice of Prime Min­is­ter Jean Cas­tex said a fi­nal de­ci­sion had not been taken.</p>
    <p>The mat­ter will be dis­cussed at a meet­ing be­tween Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron and se­nior Cab­i­net min­is­ters to­day, a gov­ern­ment source said.</p>
    <p>In Paris, one per­son was be­com­ing in­fected with Covid-19 ev­ery 30 seconds, while a Parisian is ad­mit­ted to hos­pi­tal with the dis­ease ev­ery 15 min­utes, Health Min­is­ter Olivier Veran told RTL ra­dio.</p>
    <p>The French health au­thor­i­ties re­ported 52,518 new Covid-19 cases on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>France im­posed a nightly cur­few on two-thirds of its 67 mil­lion peo­ple in the sec­ond half of last month, but this was lifted when Pres­i­dent Macron or­dered a sec­ond lock­down, al­beit less rigid than the first, which took ef­fect last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Cas­tex’s of­fice said a re­newed cur­few for Paris had been pro­posed by po­lice after it be­came clear that too many peo­ple were out late at night and breach­ing lock­down rules.</p>
    <p>The lock­down forced the clo­sure of all non-es­sen­tial busi­nesses like bars and restau­rants, banned pri­vate gath­er­ings and saw the re­turn of sworn dec­la­ra­tions needed to leave home. Schools re­main open.</p>
    <p>But some Paris res­i­dents have com­plained pri­vately that neigh­bours are still host­ing house par­ties in de­fi­ance of the rules, while some par­ents say friends are still or­gan­is­ing play­dates for their chil­dren.</p>

Austria&#x2019;s cases in re&#xAD;cent weeks have surged well past the lev&#xAD;els recorded in spring, forc&#xAD;ing the gov&#xAD;ern&#xAD;ment to im&#xAD;pose a cur&#xAD;few be&#xAD;tween 8pm and 6am from yes&#xAD;ter&#xAD;day till the end of the month.</p>
