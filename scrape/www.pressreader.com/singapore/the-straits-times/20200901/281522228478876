    <p>The High Court has granted OCBC Bank’s ap­pli­ca­tion to place KS En­ergy and its prin­ci­pal unit, KS Drilling, un­der ju­di­cial man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing comes af­ter the bank sent let­ters of de­mand to the two com­pa­nies and six other sub­sidiaries to re­pay a US$230.7 mil­lion (S$313.9 mil­lion) term loan and US$5 mil­lion bridg­ing loan made to KS Drilling.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing a “heav­ily con­tested” hear­ing yes­ter­day, High Court judge Aedit Ab­dul­lah granted the OCBC ap­pli­ca­tion and ap­pointed Mr An­drew Grim­mett and Mr Lim Loo Khoon of Deloitte & Touche as in­terim ju­di­cial man­agers.</p>
    <p>OCBC, which was rep­re­sented by Se­nior Coun­sel Sar­jit Singh Gill and Mr Daniel Tan Shi Min of Shook Lin & Bok, cited “the alarm­ing cash burn rates and losses in­curred by the KS com­pa­nies in re­cent years”.</p>
    <p>It noted that the firms are “clearly cash-flow in­sol­vent and bal­ance-sheet in­sol­vent”.</p>
    <p>KS Drilling is an 80.09 per cen­towned sub­sidiary of KS En­ergy, which pro­vided US$150 mil­lion in guar­an­tees for the term loan.</p>
    <p>The bank, which holds 61 per cent of the KS En­ergy group’s debt, cited se­ri­ous con­cerns re­gard­ing the group’s man­age­ment, given the fil­ing of crim­i­nal charges against Kris Tae­nar Wiluan, for­mer chair­man and chief ex­ec­u­tive of both KS En­ergy and KS Drilling.</p>
    <p>Wiluan, who is fac­ing 112 charges for al­leged market rig­ging and false trad­ing, re­signed from his po­si­tions at both com­pa­nies on Aug 13 “to fo­cus on his de­fence and to not let KS En­ergy group be dis­tracted or be en­tan­gled by his per­sonal prob­lems”.</p>
    <p>OCBC said in court doc­u­ments seen by The Straits Times that “the of­fence he has been charged with is es­pe­cially egre­gious be­cause the bank had ac­com­mo­dated the re­struc­tur­ing ex­er­cises dur­ing that pe­riod with­out knowl­edge that Mr Wiluan may have been try­ing to ar­ti­fi­cially prop up the value of KS En­ergy’s shares”.</p>
    <p>But Wiluan dis­puted this as “disin­gen­u­ous”, adding: “The truth is that the share price of KS En­ergy was never the ba­sis of any dis­cus­sions with OCBC re­gard­ing the loan fa­cil­i­ties, or the re­struc­tur­ing of the same.</p>
    <p>“There is no covenant given in the loan fa­cil­i­ties which re­late to or deal with KS En­ergy’s share price.”</p>
    <p>OCBC noted: “In­stead of stream­lin­ing the bloated man­age­ment of</p>
    <p>KS Drilling, some of whom had been trans­ferred from KS En­ergy, KS Drilling chose to ter­mi­nate two critical per­son­nel – Ms Diana Leng, KS Drilling’s for­mer chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer, and Mr Ni­cholas Fournier, its for­mer chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer – and left man­age­ment largely in the hands of the Wiluan fam­ily.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter Wiluan stepped down, his son Richard Wiluan and son-in­law Samuel Paul Oliver CarewJones took over man­age­ment, “as op­posed to pro­fes­sion­als”, OCBC said.</p>
    <p>But the elder Wiluan dis­agreed: “Richard and Carew-Jones have been part of the KS En­ergy group since 2007 and 2009 re­spec­tively, and are clearly fit and ca­pa­ble of car­ry­ing out their re­spon­si­bil­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>Mr Richard Wiluan, KS En­ergy’s group chair­man and CEO, has pledged his full com­mit­ment to work­ing with OCBC to re­solve its con­cerns and max­imise the in­ter­est of all cred­i­tors and the com­pany.</p>
    <p>KS Drilling’s busi­ness has been in de­cline in re­cent years, with nearly its en­tire fleet of on­shore and off­shore drilling rigs be­ing un­der-utilised or sit­ting idle, OCBC said.</p>
    <p>“In light of the fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties faced by KS Drilling and its re­lated busi­nesses un­der the KS En­ergy group, the bank had over the years agreed to sev­eral con­sen­sual re­struc­tur­ings of the group’s debt,” it added.</p>
    <p>“As KS Drilling’s fi­nan­cial po­si­tion had not im­proved and it was un­able to make pay­ment pur­suant to the re­pay­ment sched­ule, the com­pany re­quested and the bank agreed on Aug 2, 2019, to ex­tend the debt mora­to­rium for one more year from Aug 1, 2019 to July 31, 2020.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately, KS Drilling has failed to make good use of the ad­di­tional time given, with its fi­nan­cial po­si­tion con­tin­u­ing to de­te­ri­o­rate... (and) has to date not made any pay­ments.”</p>
    <p>Ow­ing to the poor per­for­mance of KS Drilling, KS En­ergy’s to­tal li­a­bil­i­ties of US$381.2 mil­lion for the 2019 fi­nan­cial year far ex­ceeds its to­tal as­sets of US$309.6 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>“Tak­ing into ac­count the mas­sive im­pacts that the Covid-19 pan­demic will con­tinue to have on the world’s econ­omy and the oil and gas in­dus­try, th­ese pro­jected trends are only likely to worsen,” OCBC said.</p>
