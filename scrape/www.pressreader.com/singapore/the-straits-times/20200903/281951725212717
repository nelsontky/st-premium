    <p>There are 47 ro­bots at work in Jewel Changi Air­port and in the air­port’s ter­mi­nals. They rep­re­sent the face of au­to­ma­tion that helps to keep Changi Air­port hum­ming along ev­ery day. The use of ro­bots and other ma­chines at a time of ris­ing un­em­ploy­ment might ap­pear counter-in­tu­itive, but it is part of the push for au­to­ma­tion that is im­por­tant for Sin­ga­pore to stay abreast of global trends. Work­ers must par­tic­i­pate in the re­mak­ing of the econ­omy be­yond Covid-19 and not get stuck in the de­cep­tive com­forts of the gig econ­omy. Changi Air­port is em­blem­atic of the larger ben­e­fits of technologi­cal change. For ex­am­ple, the use of ro­bots has helped to ease the more la­bo­ri­ous tasks of staff, as well as those of part­ners, at Jewel. This has re­sulted in smarter work and higher pro­duc­tiv­ity. These ad­van­tages, in turn, help to sus­tain the fu­ture of Jewel in par­tic­u­lar and the air­port at large. The ul­ti­mate ben­e­fi­cia­ries are Sin­ga­porean work­ers. This is a tru­ism in normal times. It is more dif­fi­cult to ac­cept dur­ing abnormal pe­ri­ods of eco­nomic his­tory. How­ever, the truth is that only a higher-level com­bi­na­tion of hu­man and ma­chine labour will en­able the Sin­ga­porean worker to hold his own against the global com­pe­ti­tion, which has been sharp­ened by the as­sault of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan is a case in point. The McKin­sey Global In­sti­tute es­ti­mates that the coun­try will need a 21/ 2- fold in­crease in pro­duc­tiv­ity growth over the next decade just to main­tain its re­cent gross do­mes­tic prod­uct growth rate. Here, McKin­sey makes the in­ter­est­ing point that the coro­n­avirus pan­demic is “ac­cel­er­at­ing a shift to­wards digi­ti­sa­tion in or­der to re­duce the spread of the virus” while al­low­ing more peo­ple and eco­nomic pro­cesses to move on­line. That move­ment could catal­yse the au­to­ma­tion of op­er­a­tions and the re­train­ing of work­ers to de­liver greater value. At the na­tional level, au­to­ma­tion would pro­vide re­lief for a na­tion plagued by low birth rates and ris­ing life ex­pectancy. Placed in a com­pa­ra­ble de­mo­graphic sit­u­a­tion, Sin­ga­pore can­not but em­brace au­to­ma­tion even as it plans for a post-pan­demic econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The chal­lenge lies in get­ting work­ers to buy into that greater pur­pose when their im­me­di­ate needs are so in­sis­tent. The dan­ger is that for some, if not many, vul­ner­a­ble work­ers, the gig econ­omy might ap­pear to de­liver the goods im­me­di­ately. There is no doubt that the gig econ­omy, whether in Sin­ga­pore or else­where, is here to stay, but it must not be con­fused with the value and con­tri­bu­tions made by the main­stream econ­omy. The con­tin­u­ous im­pe­tus for skills im­prove­ment and pro­duc­tiv­ity-driven growth that char­ac­terises main­stream ac­tiv­ity pro­vides the best pro­tec­tion against un­em­ploy­ment and un­em­ploy­a­bil­ity. The work­ers of Sin­ga­pore, a na­tion of survivors, must be ready to tap tech­nol­ogy if they are to stay ahead in the next lap of an un­end­ing jour­ney.</p>
