    <p>Re­views for the 2018 Bri­tish se­ries Save Me were some of the best you’ll ever read for a crime thriller – es­pe­cially one with the not-too-orig­i­nal premise of a man search­ing for his miss­ing daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>The se­ries was not just a who­dun­nit but also a grip­ping char­ac­ter drama and nim­ble so­cial com­men­tary, all set in a part of work­ing-class Lon­don rarely de­picted with such vi­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>At its cen­tre was the un­like­li­est of he­roes, Nelly Rowe, a smooth-talker and ladies’ man usu­ally found prop­ping up the bar at his lo­cal pub, and played by The Walk­ing Dead star Len­nie James, who also wrote the show.</p>
    <p>But Nelly’s es­tranged 13-year-old daugh­ter Jody goes miss­ing af­ter leav­ing a video say­ing she was go­ing to meet him, and it turns out the man she had been talk­ing to on­line was not the dad she barely knew but a sex traf­ficker.</p>
    <p>Her fa­ther dives head­long into a seedy un­der­ground world of preda­tors to try and find her. He fails, but ends up res­cu­ing another kid­napped girl.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond sea­son, Save Me Too, picks up the story 17 months later, and the three episodes pro­vided for re­view of­fer glimpses of why the first sea­son was so adored.</p>
    <p>Yet the nar­ra­tive will not be easy to fol­low if you have not seen Save Me, which is, baf­flingly, not avail­able to BBC view­ers in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Still, what stands out is the ex­cep­tional cast, from James and Su­ranne Jones (Doc­tor Fos­ter) as Jody’s mother to Os­car nom­i­nee Les­lie Manville (Phan­tom Thread) as the wife of one of the sex­ual preda­tors.</p>
    <p>Many of the char­ac­ters are grap­pling with some sort of crush­ing trauma and hear­ing their mono­logues about it might be a bit much if you haven’t al­ready spent one sea­son in­vest­ing in them.</p>
    <p>You also some­times wish James could take down his in­ten­sity just a notch. But there are enough bread­crumbs to keep you go­ing over some of these early bumps.</p>
    <p>Great­ness Code should have been a much eas­ier watch. The doc­u­men­tary se­ries fea­tures short in­ter­views with top ath­letes as they each dis­sect a mem­o­rable mo­ment in their ca­reers.</p>
    <p>It sounds promis­ing on pa­per. Short-form sto­ry­telling of­ten un­leashes dis­pro­por­tion­ate amounts of cre­ativ­ity, and the last few years have been good ones for sports doc­u­men­taries, with ti­tles such as O.J.: Made In Amer­ica (2016), Icarus (2017) and Cheer (2020) reel­ing in even those with zero in­ter­est in the sports they cov­ered.</p>
    <p>Yet some­how, Great­ness Code man­ages to do the op­po­site and make star ath­letes ut­terly bor­ing.</p>
    <p>The vic­tims: bas­ket­baller Lebron James, sprinter Usain Bolt, surfer Kelly Slater, swim­mer Katie Ledecky, women’s soc­cer player Alex Mor­gan, Amer­i­can-foot­ball player Tom Brady and snow­boarder Shaun White.</p>
    <p>Flashy com­puter graph­ics are de­ployed to il­lus­trate what are ba­si­cally longish sound­bites about their ca­reer high­lights.</p>
    <p>And they do so in the most painfully lit­eral way. When Lebron James says he wishes he could bot­tle up a feel­ing he had, an image of a soda bot­tle ap­pears on screen, as do colour­ful sub­ti­tles of the cliches he and the oth­ers use to de­scribe their per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>All are seated as they speak and shot talk­ing-heads style – some­times in what looks like a ho­tel room.</p>
    <p>It is like a cor­po­rate video by a com­pany try­ing to look hip and miss­ing the mark, but pre­sen­ta­tion aside, this is a fail­ure of ei­ther edit­ing or in­ter­view­ing tech­nique or both.</p>
    <p>If the anec­dotes were good, you wouldn’t need quite so many cheesy spe­cial ef­fects to an­i­mate them.</p>
    <p>Apart from Bolt, who is Ja­maican, the ath­letes are all Amer­i­can too. Most of the world will have no idea who Brady is or what a quar­ter­back does, and will be hard pressed to care as he con­grat­u­lates him­self on a per­fect game.</p>
    <p>Were no In­dian crick­eters avail­able for this? How about one of the many in­ter­na­tion­ally fa­mous foot­ball stars?</p>
    <p>The only thing Great­ness Code un­locks is a gi­ant pile of blah.</p>
