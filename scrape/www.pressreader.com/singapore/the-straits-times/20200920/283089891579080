    <p>Although I am the Sun­day Times In­vest ed­i­tor, I do not pos­sess any se­crets, skills or ad­vice that I can im­part to help you make money eas­ily and quickly.</p>
    <p>But what I do have is a very par­tic­u­lar set of skills, to use that fa­mous quote from ac­tor Liam Nee­son in the movie Taken.</p>
    <p>Skills that I have picked up over three decades of learn­ing and writ­ing news re­ports on nu­mer­ous peo­ple who have squan­dered their lives, ei­ther by com­mit­ting crimes or by los­ing their fortunes through acts of fool­ish­ness.</p>
    <p>Skills that I can im­part to you so you can start plan­ning to avoid be­ing short of money in your re­tire­ment. More im­por­tantly, I hope you can learn to say “no” to peo­ple who use all kinds of cre­ative tac­tics to make you part with your money so they can en­rich them­selves.</p>
    <p>In­deed, you would do well if you start to fol­low the most im­por­tant rule of all – be very wary when peo­ple tell you they can help you to be­come rich or make money quickly with­out the need for hard work.</p>
    <p>Ask your­self this ques­tion – if such peo­ple know the se­crets of be­com­ing rich, shouldn’t they just re­tire and en­joy their wealth in some par­adise-like re­sort?</p>
    <p>So why are they spend­ing good money ad­ver­tis­ing in var­i­ous so­cial me­dia chan­nels to help you make money too? Th­ese folks cer­tainly do not do so out of the good­ness of their hearts.</p>
    <p>The an­swer must be that they need you to give them your money by ei­ther in­vest­ing with them or pay­ing thou­sands of dol­lars to at­tend cour­ses so that they can be­come rich, at your ex­pense.</p>
    <p>There has been a pro­lif­er­a­tion of on­line ads prey­ing on fear and in­se­cu­rity amid a down­turn that has caused tens of thou­sands of peo­ple to lose their jobs and af­fected the in­come of many oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Yes, it is get­ting harder to make a liv­ing, but you should re­sist the temp­ta­tion of easy-money meth­ods that can land you in a big­ger mess. Here are some of the ruses trick­sters use to sep­a­rate you from your hard-earned cash.</p>
    <p>BE­COME A LAND­LORD WHO AL­WAYS MAKES MONEY</p>
    <p>Know­ing that Sin­ga­pore­ans are drawn to real es­tate, it seems like sound ad­vice to tell peo­ple to buy prop­erty and col­lect rent that can help meet their ex­penses.</p>
    <p>This is a so­lu­tion of­fered in on­line ads ask­ing peo­ple to sign up for classes to learn how to do this.</p>
    <p>While prop­erty has al­ways been a good in­vest­ment for those who can af­ford it in good times, we are now go­ing through the worst global re­ces­sion in re­cent times.</p>
    <p>A few months ago, the Gov­ern­ment even en­acted laws to grant busi­ness tenants ren­tal waivers of up to four months to help save them from fi­nan­cial ruin.</p>
    <p>So if you are buy­ing a prop­erty with the sole in­ten­tion of leas­ing it to make money, you face a big risk of get­ting a lot less rent or even none at all in this mar­ket.</p>
    <p>What about the profit from the prop­erty if the value goes up? In good times, maybe.</p>
    <p>But never as­sume there will al­ways be ready buy­ers, es­pe­cially in a re­ces­sion. As prop­erty is a big in­vest­ment, you can end up se­ri­ously in debt if you can­not keep up with the mort­gage pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Bear in mind that more than 34,000 prop­erty own­ers have al­ready asked their banks for mort­gage pay­ment de­fer­ments as they have prob­lems with cash flow.</p>
    <p>What about putting your money in a gen­eral pool of sim­i­lar in­vestors so that the risk is less­ened? Be­fore you think of hit­ting the jack­pot, ask how you will get your in­vest­ment back if things go wrong.</p>
    <p>Don’t end up be­ing one of those vic­tims whose only re­course is to call The Sun­day Times when your in­vest­ment dis­ap­pears, along with the peo­ple who were sup­pos­edly help­ing you get rich.</p>
    <p>IN­VEST­MENTS THAT CAN’T GO WRONG DUE TO GOOD TRACK RECORDS</p>
    <p>Be wary of over-zeal­ous folks when they show you sta­tis­tics to “prove” that their in­vest­ment funds are do­ing well even in this re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>This is usu­ally done by look­ing at all the re­turns over the past 10 years. The num­bers in the ear­lier part of the decade were good given the buoy­ant econ­omy, so the fund still shows a de­cent yield even when the poor re­turns amid the re­ces­sion are fac­tored in.</p>
    <p>But what you need to know is that the good re­turns ap­ply only to those who in­vested in the early years; the Johnny-come-latelies will be out of pocket.</p>
    <p>If you put in the money now, 2020 be­comes your Year One and the prof­itabil­ity of your in­vest­ment will de­pend on its per­for­mance in sub­se­quent years.</p>
    <p>If this re­ces­sion runs deeper and longer, you will cer­tainly not see your in­vest­ment flour­ish­ing.</p>
    <p>Think twice and do more checks be­fore you in­vest in busi­nesses that are premised on the hope of mak­ing it big – for in­stance, there are a huge num­ber of in­vestors in over­seas stock mar­kets punt­ing on com­pa­nies that are work­ing on coro­n­avirus vac­cines. As it is, no one knows which firm will de­liver an an­ti­dote for the dis­ease, so the risk of stock prices plum­met­ing for those that fail is very real.</p>
    <p>E-COM­MERCE IS THE NEW WIN FOR THOSE WORK­ING AT HOME</p>
    <p>There are many on­line ads tout­ing cour­ses that will turn you into a master in mak­ing lots of money with­out even leav­ing your home.</p>
    <p>The idea sounds sim­ple enough – source a prod­uct be­ing sold on­line and you make it as if it is yours by cre­at­ing your own e-store on pop­u­lar web­sites such as Ama­zon. For in­stance, you can find a cheap and good prod­uct that costs $2 from on­line stores in China, but put that same prod­uct on Ama­zon for $20.</p>
    <p>The train­ers claim that de­spite the huge mark-up, they are mak­ing thou­sands of sales – and tens of thou­sand dol­lars in the process.</p>
    <p>If it is so easy to make money this way, there wouldn’t be so many job­less peo­ple here – they would have be­come rich e-com­merce traders.</p>
    <p>Ask your­self this: Would you buy some­thing on­line with­out first check­ing the prices of sim­i­lar items else­where? If you do this, what makes you think your in­tended cus­tomers won’t find out that your price has been hugely in­flated?</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, even if you think this is worth a try, you should check for free videos or tips on how you can set up an e-store your­self. Turn the ta­bles on th­ese so-called train­ers – why pay for their ex­or­bi­tant course fees when you can learn for free?</p>
    <p>BE THE ‘AU­THOR’ OF THE NEXT BEST-SELL­ING E-BOOK</p>
    <p>Of all the schemes to help peo­ple make money, this is the most de­plorable. Such cour­ses claim that they can turn you into “au­thors” of best-sell­ing e-books on Ama­zon Kin­dle even if you can’t write.</p>
    <p>This is what they teach – first iden­tify some of the best-sell­ing self-help or health-re­lated books on Kin­dle, then copy the ideas and con­tent and cre­ate your own book by chang­ing the way it is writ­ten.</p>
    <p>As one trainer claims, the au­thor owns only the copy­right of how the book is writ­ten but he has no mo­nop­oly on the ideas in it, which can be copied.</p>
    <p>While such train­ers may be ex­pert in pi­rat­ing works of oth­ers, they are cer­tainly no lawyers – those who do this can still be sued if the gen­uine au­thors can show sim­i­lar­i­ties in the copied ver­sions.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, would you buy books from un­known writ­ers who can’t write?</p>
    <p>Yes, there are prob­a­bly peo­ple who end up mak­ing money even if they dab­ble in all th­ese du­bi­ous prac­tices. But al­ways re­mem­ber this wise say­ing – you may be able to fool some peo­ple some of the time, but you won’t be able to fool all the peo­ple all the time.</p>
    <p>Ask your­self this ques­tion – if such peo­ple know the se­crets of be­com­ing rich, shouldn’t they just re­tire and en­joy their wealth in some par­adise-like re­sort? So why are they spend­ing good money ad­ver­tis­ing in var­i­ous so­cial me­dia chan­nels to help you make money too?</p>
