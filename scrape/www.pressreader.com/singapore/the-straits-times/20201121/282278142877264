    <p>A new mo­bile app that fil­ters scam calls and mes­sages to pre­vent them from reach­ing cell­phone users was launched yes­ter­day by the Na­tional Crime Preven­tion Coun­cil (NCPC).</p>
    <p>Known as ScamShield, the app checks in­com­ing SMS mes­sages and calls against a list of known scam num­bers and fil­ters them if there is a match.</p>
    <p>Scam SMS mes­sages iden­ti­fied by the app are sent to the phone’s junk folder, while scam calls are au­to­mat­i­cally blocked with­out no­ti­fy­ing the user.</p>
    <p>The app, which was de­vel­oped by NCPC and the Gov­ern­ment Tech­nol­ogy Agency’s Open Gov­ern­ment Prod­ucts, also uses ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence to iden­tify scam SMS mes­sages by spot­ting key words com­monly found in such mes­sages.</p>
    <p>“Only in­com­ing SMSes from un­known con­tacts will go through ScamShield. (The app) will not scan SMSes from known con­tacts,” said NCPC.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil added that ScamShield does not have ac­cess to the user’s con­tact list, lo­ca­tion or per­sonal data. The app does not re­quire users to reg­is­ter their mo­bile num­bers ei­ther.</p>
    <p>Users can re­port scam mes­sages and calls through the app, and these will be added to the data­base and shared with the po­lice.</p>
    <p>Given the ease with which over­seas num­bers can be dis­guised to look like lo­cal call­ing num­bers, NCPC cau­tioned that num­bers that are not blocked by t he ScamShield app could still be from scam­mers.</p>
    <p>“Users should re­main vig­i­lant and adopt scam preven­tion strate­gies to avoid falling prey to scam­mers,” it said.</p>
    <p>ScamShield is cur­rently only avail­able on iOS de­vices and can be down­loaded from the App Store.</p>
