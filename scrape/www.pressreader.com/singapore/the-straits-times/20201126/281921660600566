    <p>PARIS The num­ber of peo­ple killed in ter­ror at­tacks world­wide fell for the fifth con­sec­u­tive year in 2019, with con­flict still the main driver of ter­ror but an in­crease of “far-right ter­ror­ism” seen in the West, a lead­ing think-tank said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Deaths from ter­ror­ism fell last year to 13,826, a 15 per cent drop from the year be­fore and a fur­ther an­nual de­cline from a peak in 2014, the In­sti­tute for Eco­nomics and Peace (IEP) said in its 2020 Global Ter­ror­ism In­dex.</p>
    <p>It warned that in North Amer­ica, Western Europe and Ocea­nia, deaths at­trib­uted to far-right ter­ror have in­creased by 250 per cent since 2014, with 89 killings last year.</p>
    <p>“They are higher now than at any time in the last 50 years,” it said.</p>
    <p>IEP em­pha­sised that con­flict re­mains the pri­mary driver of ter­ror­ism, with over 96 per cent of deaths from ter­ror­ism last year oc­cur­ring in coun­tries al­ready in con­flict.</p>
    <p>It said the largest de­creases in deaths oc­curred in Afghanista­n and Nige­ria, but they re­mained “the only two coun­tries to have ex­pe­ri­enced more than 1,000 deaths from ter­ror­ism”.</p>
    <p>IEP noted that de­spite the over­all fall in the global im­pact of ter­ror­ism, “it re­mains a sig­nif­i­cant and se­ri­ous threat in many coun­tries” with the sit­u­a­tion de­te­ri­o­rat­ing badly in Burk­ina Faso, Sri Lanka, Mozam­bique, Mali and Niger.</p>
    <p>For the sec­ond year in a row, South Asia was the re­gion most im­pacted by ter­ror­ism, it said.</p>
    <p>IEP ex­ec­u­tive chair­man Steve Kil­le­lea said: “As we en­ter a new decade, we are see­ing new threats of ter­ror­ism emerge. The rise of the far right in the West and the de­te­ri­o­ra­tion in the Sa­hel (in Africa) are prime ex­am­ples.”</p>
    <p>The Tale­ban was still “the world’s dead­li­est ter­ror­ist group” last year, IEP noted, adding that the strength of the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria con­tin­ued to de­cline while its af­fil­i­ates re­mained ac­tive, es­pe­cially in sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa.</p>
    <p>IEP said while data in­di­cates a de­cline in ter­ror in­ci­dents and deaths since the Covid-19 pan­demic be­gan, the health sit­u­a­tion is likely to present “new and dis­tinct” counter-ter­ror­ism chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>The “ex­tended eco­nomic down­turn” caused by Covid-19 “is likely to in­crease po­lit­i­cal in­sta­bil­ity and vi­o­lence”, it said.</p>
