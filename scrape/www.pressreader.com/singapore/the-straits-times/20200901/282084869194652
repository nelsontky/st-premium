    <p>My speech will cover a va­ri­ety of top­ics or­gan­ised into three main ar­eas. First, I will speak about cer­tain things that have changed in Sin­ga­pore. Sec­ond, I will talk about things that must not change, and third, I will sug­gest that some things should change.</p>
    <p>First, let me speak about a few things that have changed in Sin­ga­pore in the af­ter­math of the last elec­tions. Im­me­di­ately af­ter the re­sults of the gen­eral elec­tion were known, the Prime Min­is­ter an­nounced the po­si­tion of Leader of the Op­po­si­tion (LO) and that this would come with sup­port and re­sources. It would be an un­der­state­ment to say that this an­nounce­ment came as a sur­prise to the WP and to mem­bers of the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>My view is to take the ap­point­ment of the LO and the mo­tives be­hind it pos­i­tively. The PM has sig­nalled a change in the nar­ra­tive and cul­ture of how pol­i­tics and govern­ment is to be con­ducted, and I thank him for that.</p>
    <p>We look for­ward to a dif­fer­ent tone of po­lit­i­cal en­gage­ment, and the WP ac­cepts the change as an­other step to­wards a First World Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>This ap­point­ment has al­ready cre­ated ex­pec­ta­tions. My per­sonal ex­pec­ta­tion is that my WP col­leagues and I will have to work ex­tra hard. We will have to ask our­selves tough ques­tions be­fore cri­tiquing govern­ment pol­icy – the chief of which is, what would we do if we were in charge?</p>
    <p>With the new changes, it needs to be clear what the Op­po­si­tion can and can­not do.</p>
    <p>The ap­point­ment of the LO is an op­por­tu­nity for cit­i­zens, and in­deed politi­cians, to ed­u­cate our­selves and un­der­stand bet­ter what ex­actly it is that the Op­po­si­tion does and what its pur­pose is. What does it mean to be a check and bal­ance on the Govern­ment, and how ex­actly can the Op­po­si­tion pro­pose al­ter­na­tive poli­cies?</p>
    <p>My as­sess­ment is that the pub­lic ex­pects the WP and the Op­po­si­tion in gen­eral to play a con­struc­tive role in Sin­ga­pore pol­i­tics. It should ad­vance the in­ter­ests of all Sin­ga­pore­ans, whether they may be in the ma­jor­ity or mi­nor­ity on any par­tic­u­lar is­sue, with­out fear or favour.</p>
    <p>For op­po­si­tion par­ties to make greater head­way in Par­lia­ment, we have to un­der­stand that to­day’s po­lit­i­cal con­text ne­ces­si­tates the de­vel­op­ment of a ra­tio­nal and re­spon­si­ble ap­proach to op­po­si­tion pol­i­tics that places not just the Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen, but Sin­ga­pore at the core.</p>
    <p>Mr Speaker, my WP col­leagues and I will set our own stan­dards and chart an in­de­pen­dent course... The road ahead will not be easy but any­thing worth­while never is. We will do our best by Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>But how much we can do and how much our po­lit­i­cal con­ver­sa­tion evolves for the bet­ter will be driven by three things:</p>
    <p>One, by the quan­tity and qual­ity of in­for­ma­tion that is shared by the Govern­ment in Par­lia­ment and separately, re­leased to the pub­lic more gen­er­ally; two, by the re­sources given by the Govern­ment, to an­a­lyse and use that in­for­ma­tion for the ben­e­fit of the pub­lic; and three, by the will­ing­ness of the Govern­ment to lis­ten to, and im­ple­ment, the al­ter­na­tive ideas sug­gested.</p>
    <p>As far as in­for­ma­tion is con­cerned, the Op­po­si­tion’s out­put will de­pend very much on whether we can get the in­put we ask for. We in­tend to make tar­geted in­quiries of govern­ment de­part­ments and pub­lic agen­cies, as such in­for­ma­tion is es­sen­tial for craft­ing al­ter­na­tive poli­cies.</p>
    <p>On its part, the Govern­ment should con­sider how it can put out more in­for­ma­tion with­out be­ing asked, par­tic­u­larly in­for­ma­tion and in­di­ca­tors bench­marked against other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>In early 2018, I asked a par­lia­men­tary ques­tion about the num­ber of per­ma­nent res­i­dents or PRs who re­mained PRs for more than 10, 15, 20 and 25 years re­spec­tively, and the com­mon rea­sons cited by th­ese in­di­vid­u­als for not tak­ing up Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen­ship. The in­for­ma­tion pro­vided was far nar­rower – specif­i­cally that about 15 per cent of PRs have been PRs for 20 or more years.</p>
    <p>Sir, the ad­di­tional de­tails that were not pro­vided are im­por­tant so the Op­po­si­tion can con­sider and put for­ward al­ter­na­tive ap­proaches to pop­u­la­tion and im­mi­gra­tion poli­cies. The data would also put into stark re­lief the rel­e­vance of re­fer­ring to some­one as a lo­cal in our sta­tis­ti­cal data when it is clear ei­ther that some PRs do not want to be­come Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens or the state has no plans to ex­tend cit­i­zen­ship to them.</p>
    <p>Mr Speaker, I ac­cept that such mat­ters are sen­si­tive, and the Govern­ment’s un­will­ing­ness to pro­vide the data in the for­mat or de­tail re­quested may arise not be­cause of an un­will­ing­ness to dis­close in­for­ma­tion. In­stead, there could be gen­uine con­cerns about how the in­for­ma­tion will be used, or per­haps mis­used, to rile pock­ets of the pop­u­la­tion, since PR pol­icy is closely tied to im­mi­gra­tion and jobs.</p>
    <p>But it is my case that the Govern­ment will have to find a new way of deal­ing with such dif­fi­cult mat­ters. And I strongly be­lieve Par­lia­ment is an im­por­tant safety valve and po­ten­tial mod­er­a­tor of the ex­treme con­ver­sa­tions found off­line and on­line on im­mi­gra­tion and pop­u­la­tion is­sues.</p>
    <p>As for re­sources, I would like to share my un­der­stand­ing of the re­sources that will be pro­vided to the LO. Ev­ery elected MP is given a bud­get to hire a leg­isla­tive as­sis­tant and a sec­re­tar­ial as­sis­tant. The leg­isla­tive as­sis­tant is paid an al­lowance of $1,300 per month and the sec­re­tar­ial as­sis­tant is paid an al­lowance of $500 a month. Based on th­ese sums, th­ese po­si­tions are, of ne­ces­sity, part-time ones.</p>
    <p>By con­trast... a sit­ting Govern­ment has at its dis­posal the re­sources of a Sin­ga­pore Pub­lic Ser­vice of 146,000 full-time of­fi­cers. Of th­ese, 85,000 are mem­bers of the civil ser­vice.</p>
    <p>The LO’s of­fice will not have the breadth and depth of the party in govern­ment in com­ing up with al­ter­na­tive poli­cies. Nonethe­less, the WP will con­tinue pur­su­ing al­ter­na­tives we feel are im­por­tant for Sin­ga­pore, an ex­am­ple be­ing the pro­posal for re­dun­dancy in­sur­ance for work­ers...</p>
    <p>With just 10 MPs... it is not fea­si­ble for the WP to set up a shadow Cabi­net in the tra­di­tion of West­min­ster Par­lia­ments. There are 16 min­istries, in­clud­ing the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice. De­spite not be­ing able to shadow each min­istry, we in­tend to or­gan­ise our MPs to look into five ar­eas that are critical for Sin­ga­pore and of huge im­por­tance to Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>The five ar­eas are: one – health, age­ing and re­tire­ment ad­e­quacy; two – jobs, busi­nesses and the econ­omy; three – ed­u­ca­tion, inequal­ity and the cost of liv­ing; four – hous­ing, trans­port and in­fra­struc­ture: and five – na­tional sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Things that must not change</p>
    <p>First, Sin­ga­pore’s his­tor­i­cal po­si­tion as a trad­ing na­tion. Sec­ond, the Govern­ment’s poli­cies and ac­tions on de­fence and for­eign pol­icy. And fi­nally, cer­tain things that are now syn­ony­mous with Sin­ga­pore – mul­tira­cial­ism, the green­ing of Sin­ga­pore, the qual­ity of our pub­lic li­braries and our cul­ture of ab­hor­ring cor­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has al­ways been a trad­ing na­tion and open bor­ders are a fact of our lives. In­vestors should know that Sin­ga­pore will never close for busi­ness no mat­ter how many WP MPs are in Par­lia­ment. We make a liv­ing by be­ing rel­e­vant to the world and separately as a trust­wor­thy and re­li­able in­ter­locu­tor. Op­po­si­tion pol­i­tics and ad­vo­cacy for Sin­ga­pore­ans can­not ig­nore Sin­ga­pore’s place in the world and what we of­fer to the world. We must still look out­ward, even as we con­tin­u­ally search for a last­ing modus vivendi which ac­com­mo­dates the do­mes­tic pres­sures of be­ing eco­nom­i­cally open, and the re­al­ity of a Sin­ga­pore iden­tity that evolves and crys­tallises as our na­tion ma­tures.</p>
    <p>GOVERN­MENT POLI­CIES ON DE­FENCE AND FOR­EIGN POL­ICY</p>
    <p>Mov­ing on to the sec­ond thing that must not change. The WP sup­ports the Govern­ment’s po­si­tions on de­fence and for­eign pol­icy. Th­ese must con­tinue as they are. Th­ese poli­cies are well con­sid­ered and they place pri­macy on Sin­ga­pore’s in­ter­est while seek­ing long-term mu­tual cooperatio­n with other coun­tries and in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions. They also take into ac­count the re­al­ism of the in­ter­na­tional pol­i­tics and the re­al­ity of not just a small state, but our pe­cu­liar cir­cum­stances too.</p>
    <p>The WP backs the Govern­ment in in­volv­ing Sin­ga­pore in United Na­tions ini­tia­tives, and those of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, the World Bank, Unesco, the In­ter­na­tional Labour Or­gan­i­sa­tion and other mul­ti­lat­eral ini­tia­tives. We sup­port the Govern­ment’s ef­forts in work­ing with our neigh­bours to bol­ster Asean. In par­tic­u­lar, we sup­port Sin­ga­pore’s ef­forts to work with Asean and other coun­tries to fi­nalise the South China Sea Code of Con­duct. As a small mar­itime na­tion and, separately, a trad­ing na­tion, the sanc­tity of in­ter­na­tional agree­ments and ad­her­ence to the rule of law are nec­es­sary to dis­cour­age ar­bi­trary be­hav­iour by more pow­er­ful states.</p>
    <p>THINGS THAT ARE A PART OF SIN­GA­PORE</p>
    <p>Next, we sup­port the Govern­ment’s work in con­tin­u­ing var­i­ous things that have be­come a part of Sin­ga­pore’s DNA.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s po­si­tion on cor­rup­tion must not change. Equally im­por­tant is Sin­ga­pore’s em­pha­sis on ra­cial and reli­gious har­mony. Th­ese words are al­most a cliche in Sin­ga­pore, and we should be grate­ful for that, be­cause in many other coun­tries, it is a source of in­tractable prob­lems. The WP strongly be­lieves in Sin­ga­pore’s mul­tira­cial, multi-reli­gious and mul­ti­cul­tural community. It is im­por­tant that all com­mu­ni­ties sup­port, re­spect and ac­com­mo­date each other.</p>
    <p>Things that should change</p>
    <p>It is my con­vic­tion that th­ese changes would im­prove gov­er­nance and bet­ter look af­ter the needs of Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>First, to lev­er­age an in­de­pen­dent or­gan of state, namely Par­lia­ment, the WP pro­poses the for­ma­tion of more Se­lect Com­mit­tees.</p>
    <p>Some con­ver­sa­tions in Sin­ga­pore can con­tinue to be di­vi­sive un­less we de­ci­sively cre­ate a frame­work for rea­soned con­ver­sa­tion. Par­lia­ment, us­ing the plat­form of Se­lect Com­mit­tees, can op­er­ate as an im­por­tant safety valve and agent of pos­i­tive con­ver­sa­tions that ought to have a di­rect im­pact on poli­cies and laws.</p>
    <p>More sig­nif­i­cantly, in the in­for­ma­tion ecol­ogy of to­day’s world, mis­in­for­ma­tion and dis­in­for­ma­tion cam­paigns are run on­line and off­line, usu­ally in com­bi­na­tion, to ma­nip­u­late con­tent and hi­jack nar­ra­tives. This House and the Govern­ment need to re­frame the pub­lic nar­ra­tive on our more press­ing is­sues.</p>
    <p>In many coun­tries to­day, even the main­stream me­dia can­not mod­er­ate the con­ver­sa­tion with­out sig­nif­i­cant pub­lic fund­ing. A re­cent head­line from the magazine Cur­rent Af­fairs put it starkly: the truth is pay­walled and the lies are free – an apt de­scrip­tion of the dilemma fac­ing the main­stream me­dia in the face of some as­pects of so­cial me­dia. By form­ing Se­lect</p>
    <p>Com­mit­tees that meet reg­u­larly on the most sen­si­tive and dif­fi­cult is­sues for Sin­ga­pore, Par­lia­ment can play a big­ger role in lead­ing the con­ver­sa­tion and cham­pi­oning the truth.</p>
    <p>FOR­EIGN­ERS IN THE ECON­OMY</p>
    <p>The next thing we need to change in Sin­ga­pore is how we man­age and ac­com­mo­date for­eign­ers in our econ­omy. Their pres­ence gives Sin­ga­pore a vi­tal­ity that keeps us eco­nom­i­cally rel­e­vant and also pro­vides jobs and op­por­tu­ni­ties to our fel­low Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Many of us count the for­eign­ers in our midst, re­gard­less of race, lan­guage or re­li­gion, as our friends. That open­ness and friendly at­ti­tude must con­tinue as a man­i­fes­ta­tion of the Sin­ga­pore spirit and the Sin­ga­pore we leave be­hind for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions of Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>But it is pre­cisely be­cause we need for­eign­ers to power our econ­omy that we need to pay more at­ten­tion to Sin­ga­pore work­ers who feel ex­cluded from op­por­tu­ni­ties cre­ated in their home­land.</p>
    <p>In re­cent weeks, let­ters in the Straits Times Fo­rum have been pub­lished, one by a re­tired se­nior Sin­ga­porean banker and an­other by the man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore in re­ply. Th­ese ap­peared af­ter the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) placed 47 com­pa­nies on the Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work watch­list. Of the 47 com­pa­nies, 30 were fi­nan­cial and pro­fes­sional ser­vices in­sti­tu­tions. On the MOM’s web­site, ex­am­ples are given of one wealth man­age­ment firm where al­most three-quar­ters of its PMET – or pro­fes­sional, man­ager, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian – jobs are held by per­sons of the same na­tion­al­ity. An­other ex­am­ple is given of a bank where al­most two-thirds are of the same na­tion­al­ity.</p>
    <p>The ob­vi­ous ques­tion is: How did those two com­pa­nies get to those stages with­out MOM tak­ing action be­fore this? To be fair, this is a com­plex is­sue. For ex­am­ple, there may be some jus­ti­fi­ca­tion if the bank’s cus­tomers are not in Sin­ga­pore, but are from the same coun­try as the PMETs, and if th­ese cus­tomers do not speak any of the lan­guages widely used in</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore. Some have ar­gued that this is what it takes for Sin­ga­pore to be­come a global fi­nan­cial hub.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem is that we sim­ply do not know enough. And the vac­uum has given space for a more toxic con­ver­sa­tion to fer­ment. We should nip this forth­with and some of the de­tails ear­lier this week from the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI) about inter-cor­po­rate trans­fer­ees and re­marks by the Min­is­ter for MTI have been im­por­tant. To this end, more in­for­ma­tion, and not less, is cer­tainly most help­ful.</p>
    <p>One way for us in Par­lia­ment and for the pub­lic to know is for MOM to pub­lish the names of re­cal­ci­trant em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>We can then un­der­stand the op­er­at­ing par­a­digm of such busi­nesses and how they in­tend to make the tran­si­tion to fair hir­ing prac­tices.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment needs to raise its sig­na­ture in this re­gard, es­pe­cially since the is­sue is such a hot-but­ton one, of­ten gen­er­at­ing a lot of heat but very lit­tle light. To as­sist, a Par­lia­men­tary Se­lect Com­mit­tee can in­ves­ti­gate the lim­i­ta­tions of the work­force and the needs of the econ­omy on the one hand; and the re­al­ity of the Sin­ga­porean worker in the face of com­pe­ti­tion and the con­straints faced by em­ploy­ers on the other.</p>
    <p>Be­yond this, a far more pur­pose­ful way to pre­vent com­pa­nies from hir­ing un­fairly would be for Par­lia­ment to pass anti-dis­crim­i­na­tion leg­is­la­tion and im­pose penal­ties for dis­crim­i­na­tory prac­tices by egre­gious of­fend­ers. This should be con­sid­ered along­side a more ac­tivist ap­proach by the Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Fair Em­ploy­ment Prac­tices or Tafep in the im­me­di­ate term.</p>
    <p>Tied closely to the is­sue of the hir­ing of for­eign­ers is whether the ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem is adequately pre­par­ing our cit­i­zens for the jobs that are avail­able.</p>
    <p>The big banks – OCBC, UOB and DBS – all have work­forces that are made up of at least 90 per cent Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens and per­ma­nent res­i­dents. It is un­clear what pro­por­tion are Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens. Stan­dard Char­tered has said that 70 per cent of its lo­cal sub­sidiary’s staff are Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens. Are th­ese re­ally high num­bers?</p>
    <p>What are the rea­sons why th­ese banks can­not be staffed by even more Sin­ga­pore­ans?</p>
    <p>The two main jus­ti­fi­ca­tions given for the hir­ing of for­eign­ers are first, that they are un­able to find Sin­ga­pore­ans with the ex­per­tise; and sec­ond, that for­eign­ers do jobs that are un­de­sired by Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>As it is un­likely that well-pay­ing bank­ing jobs are un­de­sired by Sin­ga­pore­ans, the jus­ti­fi­ca­tion of th­ese banks in hir­ing for­eign­ers must be that they are un­able to find enough Sin­ga­pore­ans with the needed ex­per­tise.</p>
    <p>If that is true, then we need to ask where the gaps are in our ed­u­ca­tion and life­long learn­ing train­ing sys­tems. Th­ese gaps must be found and plugged as soon as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Mr Speaker, I have spent some time on th­ese mat­ters which are on the lips of many Sin­ga­pore­ans be­cause I be­lieve that in spite of Covid-19 and the changes tak­ing place in the world, op­por­tu­ni­ties are aris­ing that Sin­ga­pore can take ad­van­tage of. For ex­am­ple, the seis­mic po­lit­i­cal changes in Hong Kong may prompt some in­ter­na­tional busi­nesses to move to other ju­ris­dic­tions. We should aim to wel­come those look­ing to move. But if we do not move pur­pose­fully to con­sol­i­date and po­si­tion the Sin­ga­porean PMET in a com­pet­i­tive po­si­tion vis-a-vis the work pass holder, the Govern­ment will not be able to se­cure sup­port for its eco­nomic agenda and take ad­van­tage of op­por­tu­ni­ties while main­tain­ing so­cial har­mony.</p>
    <p>TRADES­MEN</p>
    <p>An­other thing that should change in Sin­ga­pore is rais­ing of the value of the work of Sin­ga­pore trades­men.</p>
    <p>In places like Aus­tralia, New Zealand and Ger­many, trades­men make good wages that match or even out­strip those of univer­sity grad­u­ates.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, although our ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions train our cit­i­zens for such vo­ca­tions, not enough is done to pro­tect their trades. The way to pro­tect our trades­men is to reg­u­late who can prac­tise each trade.</p>
    <p>Med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als, ac­coun­tants, quan­tity sur­vey­ors, in­sur­ance prac­ti­tion­ers and real estate sales pro­fes­sion­als have to be prop­erly qual­i­fied and cer­ti­fied. This en­ables them to earn a wage that is pro­tected from un­der­cut­ting by the un­qual­i­fied. How­ever, for trades such as air-con­di­tioner ser­vic­ing and plumb­ing, for ex­am­ple, any­one can of­fer such ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Up­lift­ing our trades­men will re­quire a par­a­digm shift in how work­ers are viewed and trained. If it suc­ceeds, it will raise the self-es­teem and in­comes of Sin­ga­pore­ans who may not be aca­dem­i­cally in­clined but who have ac­quired valu­able skills that many of us in this House would not be able to fully master. It is my view that such a de­ci­sive shift will fun­da­men­tally al­ter our un­der­stand­ing of mer­i­toc­racy.</p>
    <p>A KINDER, GEN­TLER SIN­GA­PORE</p>
    <p>The fi­nal point I would like to make on things that should change is on greater help for those who need it most.</p>
    <p>The WP be­lieves that the Pi­o­neer and Merdeka Gen­er­a­tion schemes are good ones. How­ever, we be­lieve more can be done.</p>
    <p>We know that there are trade-offs. Ex­tend­ing more health and other so­cial ben­e­fits comes with a cost. Could this re­sult in higher in­come taxes for many Sin­ga­pore­ans and those who work here, for ex­am­ple? Yes. But the ben­e­fits will go be­yond mere fi­nan­cial help for those who need it.</p>
    <p>Will there be a price to pay in terms of higher costs for the end-con­sumer? This must be ex­pected. In­creas­ingly, there will be a price to pay if we wish to be “one united peo­ple” and move be­yond the phrase as an as­pi­ra­tion or worse, a plat­i­tude.</p>
    <p>Many Scan­di­na­vians are con­tent to pay higher taxes be­cause they know this means that oth­ers in their so­ci­ety will be able to live with greater dig­nity. For those who earn higher in­comes, to pay higher taxes is a point of pride for many of them.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean iden­tity which sees community as a cen­tral pil­lar of its DNA should im­bibe such think­ing with those bet­ter-off pay­ing more. Let us build a kinder and gen­tler Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Con­clu­sion</p>
    <p>As his­tory tells us, change can be for the bet­ter or for the worse. Around 50 years ago, some Asian coun­tries were pros­per­ous and thriv­ing. Fast for­ward to to­day, as a di­rect re­sult of bad choices and in spite of the best in­ten­tions, things have gone awry.</p>
    <p>How­ever Sin­ga­pore piv­ots or evolves in the years to come, I be­lieve a rea­soned con­ver­sa­tion be­fore choices and de­ci­sions are made, or not made, will be critical. Th­ese will take time and con­sume much en­ergy, and we will have to guard against con­ver­sa­tions which are hi­jacked to ad­vance sec­tional in­ter­ests that de­monise those who have reser­va­tions or a dif­fer­ent per­spec­tive.</p>
    <p>The WP will seek to play a pos­i­tive role in the na­tional con­ver­sa­tion both in and out of Par­lia­ment, to leave be­hind a Sin­ga­pore our chil­dren and fu­ture gen­er­a­tions can be proud of.</p>
