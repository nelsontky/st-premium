    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia’s ex­tra­or­di­nary 1MDB cor­rup­tion scandal al­legedly saw top of­fi­cials loot bil­lions from state cof­fers and go on a world­wide spend­ing spree – buy­ing a US$250 mil­lion (S$345 mil­lion) yacht and a paint­ing by Vin­cent van Gogh, and fi­nanc­ing a Hol­ly­wood block­buster.</p>
    <p>Na­jib Razak, the then Prime Min­is­ter, was a key fig­ure in the plun­der­ing of sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Devel­op­ment Ber­had (1MDB), and was con­victed yes­ter­day in his first cor­rup­tion trial linked to the fraud.</p>
    <p>WHAT WAS 1MDB?</p>
    <p>1MDB was a state in­vest­ment fund which Na­jib launched in 2009, shortly af­ter be­com­ing prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Its port­fo­lio in­cluded power plants and other en­ergy as­sets in Malaysia and the Mid­dle East, as well as real es­tate in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>The fund was closely over­seen by Na­jib.</p>
    <p>Whis­tle-blow­ers say Low Taek Jho, a jet-set­ting Malaysian fi­nancier close to Na­jib but with no of­fi­cial position, helped set up 1MDB and made key fi­nan­cial de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>Con­cerns es­ca­lated in 2014 as 1MDB slid into an US$11 bil­lion debt hole, and in­ten­si­fy­ing public scru­tiny re­vealed miss­ing funds.</p>
    <p>The scandal first came to light through the Sarawak Re­port news por­tal, and gained fur­ther trac­tion in 2015 when The Wall Street Jour­nal pub­lished doc­u­ments show­ing that Na­jib re­ceived at least US$681 mil­lion in pay­ments to his per­sonal bank ac­counts.</p>
    <p>RICH LIV­ING</p>
    <p>The United States Jus­tice Depart­ment launched its own probe fol­low­ing claims that stolen Malaysian public money was laun­dered through the US fi­nan­cial sys­tem, and has filed law­suits seek­ing some US$1.8 bil­lion in as­sets al­legedly pur­chased with the cash.</p>
    <p>The depart­ment said more than US$4.5 bil­lion was stolen from 1MDB between 2009 and 2015 by high-level of­fi­cials at the fund and their as­so­ciates.</p>
    <p>Tens of mil­lions of dol­lars were used in 2012 by Na­jib’s step­son Riza Aziz, an aspir­ing film pro­ducer, to fund the Hol­ly­wood film The Wolf Of Wall Street, star­ring Leonardo Di­Caprio.</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of mil­lions were also used, mainly by Mr Riza and Low, to pur­chase high-end real es­tate in Bev­erly Hills, New York and Lon­don.</p>
    <p>A Claude Monet paint­ing bought for US$35 mil­lion, a Van Gogh for US$5.5 mil­lion, a US$35 mil­lion Bom­bardier jet, a US$100 mil­lion stake in EMI Mu­sic Pub­lish­ing, and a US$250 mil­lion yacht were also ticked off the shop­ping list.</p>
    <p>PO­LIT­I­CAL TUR­BU­LENCE</p>
    <p>Na­jib des­per­ately sought to con­tain the scandal, tar­get­ing crit­ics and in­tro­duc­ing re­pres­sive laws, but the al­le­ga­tions hit the pop­u­lar­ity of his long-rul­ing coali­tion and con­trib­uted to a shock elec­tion de­feat in 2018.</p>
    <p>A new gov­ern­ment headed by vet­eran politi­cian Ma­hathir Mo­hamad, now aged 95, came to of­fice on a wave of public anger, and re­opened in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Na­jib was hit with dozens of charges, and his first trial over the scandal fi­nally started in April last year.</p>
    <p>But in Fe­bru­ary this year, the re­formist al­liance col­lapsed af­ter bit­ter in­fight­ing, and a new coali­tion that in­cluded Na­jib’s scan­dalplagued party seized power.</p>
    <p>There were con­cerns this could im­pact Na­jib’s tri­als – par­tic­u­larly af­ter 1MDB-linked charges against Mr Riza were un­ex­pect­edly dropped in May.</p>
    <p>THE TRIAL</p>
    <p>But those fears proved un­founded af­ter a judge yes­ter­day found Na­jib guilty of all seven charges in his first trial linked to 1MDB and sen­tenced him to 12 years’ jail.</p>
    <p>The case cen­tred on al­le­ga­tions that RM42 mil­lion (S$13.6 mil­lion) was trans­ferred to the 67-year-old’s bank ac­counts from SRC In­ter­na­tional, a for­mer unit of the fund.</p>
    <p>His lawyers in­sisted that he had no knowl­edge of the trans­fers, and claimed that Low was the true master­mind be­hind the scam.</p>
    <p>But Jus­tice Mohd Na­zlan Mohd Ghaz­ali said the idea that Low had tricked Na­jib was “far­fetched”, and also dis­missed the ar­gu­ment that the for­mer leader be­lieved the money in his ac­count was a do­na­tion from Saudi roy­alty.</p>
    <p>It is not the most sig­nif­i­cant of the tri­als he is fac­ing. That one be­gan in Au­gust last year, with Na­jib ac­cused of il­lic­itly ob­tain­ing RM2.28 bil­lion from 1MDB.</p>
