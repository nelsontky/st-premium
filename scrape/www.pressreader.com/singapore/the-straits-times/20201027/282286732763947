    <p>MADRID Real Madrid have re­leased the pres­sure on Zine­dine Zi­dane tem­po­rar­ily, with the next task to fix their dis­mal start in the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>Real’s 3-1 win over Barcelona in the Cla­sico on Satur­day swerved a third con­sec­u­tive de­feat af­ter losses to Cadiz in La Liga and Shakhtar Donetsk.</p>
    <p>“There are al­ways bad spells,” said Ser­gio Ramos. “Hope­fully, this one has only lasted a week.”</p>
    <p>But the ef­fects of the 3-2 im­plo­sion against Shakhtar, who had 10 first-team play­ers miss­ing due to coron­avirus in­fec­tions, still linger, with Real sit­ting bot­tom of Group B in the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>A vic­tory away to Borus­sia Monchengla­d­bach to­day would limit the dam­age, es­pe­cially af­ter the Bun­desliga out­fit’s open­ing 2-2 draw with Serie A side In­ter Mi­lan which kept the group tight.</p>
    <p>Zi­dane knows a con­vinc­ing per­for­mance in Ger­many should sus­pend talk of a cri­sis and dis­pel doubts about his fu­ture, at least for now.</p>
    <p>Even for Real, t wo de­feats seemed am­mu­ni­tion for the un­cer­tainty around their coach that fol­lowed. In the af­ter­math of their win at the Nou Camp, Span­ish ra­dio sta­tion Onda Cero said that for­mer Tot­ten­ham man­ager Mauri­cio Po­chet­tino had been sounded out by the Span­ish gi­ants with a view to­wards po­ten­tially re­plac­ing Zi­dane.</p>
    <p>Other re­ports i n the Span­ish press also dis­cussed the Ar­gen­tinian, who spent five years with the Premier League club be­fore be­ing sacked last year.</p>
    <p>But Zi­dane has brushed off the spec­u­la­tion, say­ing: “I have al­ways been crit­i­cal of my­self, it is what drives you to im­prove.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter a loss, as a coach, most of the crit­i­cism comes at me and that’s nor­mal.”</p>
    <p>The quick­ness to ques­tion the French­man has be­come a reg­u­lar fea­ture of his ten­ure, even while the play­ers sing his praises and the tro­phies have poured in.</p>
    <p>It was only three months ago Real were win­ning their sec­ond La Liga ti­tle of his three full sea­sons in charge, to go with three tri­umphs in the Cham­pi­ons League and 11 tro­phies in to­tal.</p>
    <p>Suc­cess, though, has never been enough for Zi­dane, who be­gan his sec­ond stint in March last year.</p>
    <p>His rep­u­ta­tion as a man-man­ager has al­ways been a back­handed com­pli­ment, even if get­ting the best out of good play­ers is surely the key to be­ing the coach of a team like Real.</p>
    <p>In­con­sis­tency con­tin­ues to plague his side. When they stormed to the ti­tle dur­ing the 11-game run-in last sea­son, it was with no other dis­trac­tions and a tro­phy in sight.</p>
    <p>With a less im­me­di­ate prize and against lesser op­po­nents, the sus­pi­cion is those play­ers Zi­dane trusts com­pletely be­come un­re­li­able.</p>
    <p>“I have won many things with these play­ers,” he said. “I will al­ways be with them un­til the end.”</p>
    <p>Zi­dane rou­tinely side­steps the is­sue of his fu­ture, which cre­ates a ner­vous­ness af­ter he re­signed so un­ex­pect­edly af­ter win­ning the Cham­pi­ons League in 2018.</p>
    <p>That con­trib­utes to the sense of short-ter­mism, an age­ing team man­aged by a coach who seem­ingly re­fuses to look be­yond the end of the week.</p>
    <p>Any­thing but a win to­day and the cy­cle of in­sta­bil­ity be­gins again.</p>
