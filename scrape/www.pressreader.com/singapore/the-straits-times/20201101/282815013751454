    <p>For peo­ple who are 40 and above to­day, the qual­ity of your life is to a large ex­tent the cu­mu­la­tive ef­fect of im­por­tant de­ci­sions in your life. Of course, luck plays a part as well. So, are there ways to en­sure that we by and large make sound and ra­tio­nal de­ci­sions that also min­imise the im­pact of po­ten­tial bad luck on us?</p>
    <p>For me, I think the way is through an ev­i­dence-based ap­proach to de­ci­sion-mak­ing, cou­pled with a large dose of com­mon sense so that you can man­age your funds in a sound man­ner, with­out in­flict­ing too much emo­tional toll on your­self.</p>
    <p>To­day, we’ll talk about how to al­lo­cate your funds.</p>
    <p>There is no short­age of in­vest­ment prod­ucts avail­able in the mar­ket; th­ese range from ex­change-traded funds to bonds and eq­ui­ties, macro and com­mod­ity funds, just to name a few. How do you de­cide on your al­lo­ca­tion of funds in or­der to build an ef­fi­cient and re­silient port­fo­lio?</p>
    <p>First, let’s start with Chart 1, which shows the real re­turns af­ter in­fla­tion, of the var­i­ous as­set classes since 1973. As an as­set class, eq­ui­ties pro­vided the high­est real re­turns.</p>
    <p>The draw­back is that it is more volatile. Cash is very sta­ble – the line is al­most straight – but the re­turn is very low.</p>
    <p>At the long-term eq­ui­ties real re­turn of about 7 per cent a year, it will take you about 10 years to dou­ble your pur­chas­ing power. Mean­while, at 0.9 per cent a year, it will take 80 years to dou­ble your fund’s pur­chas­ing power if they are parked in cash.</p>
    <p>So is there a way to ob­tain the higher re­turns of eq­ui­ties and yet mit­i­gate some of the volatil­ity of the as­set class?</p>
    <p>Dif­fer­ent seg­ments of the eq­ui­ties mar­kets will per­form dif­fer­ently over dif­fer­ent pe­ri­ods. Eq­ui­ties can be grouped based on ge­og­ra­phy, sec­tors, style of in­vest­ing, among other things.</p>
    <p>Chart 2 shows the rolling five-year per­for­mance of the</p>
    <p>MSCI AC Asia ex-Ja­pan In­dex v the US S&P 500 In­dex. As you can see, there were pe­ri­ods when Asian stocks out­per­formed, and pe­ri­ods when US stocks out­per­formed.</p>
    <p>Chart 3 shows the rolling five-year re­turns of value v growth style of in­vest­ing among US mid-cap stocks. Value – an in­vest­ing strat­egy where one looks for bar­gains – has by and large done bet­ter over the long his­tory of the mar­kets.</p>
    <p>But there are pe­ri­ods when growth in­vest­ing – buy­ing into com­pa­nies with high growth but which come with more ex­pen­sive price tags – has done bet­ter.</p>
    <p>One way to not feel left out, when say the US mar­kets are do­ing bet­ter, or vice versa; or when growth is do­ing bet­ter, is to make sure that you di­ver­sify your funds, in terms of ge­og­ra­phy, styles and strat­egy.</p>
    <p>How­ever, when you do that, you have to be men­tally pre­pared that some of your funds will not do well dur­ing cer­tain pe­ri­ods. But they will catch up in an­other pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The key is to view all your funds as ONE port­fo­lio. As shown in Chart 1, eq­ui­ties should gen­er­ate higher re­turns over time. But dif­fer­ent groups of eq­ui­ties will per­form dif­fer­ently at dif­fer­ent times. As a whole, over the long term, they should be able to de­liver you the re­turns, the short-term volatil­ity not­with­stand­ing.</p>
    <p>Given that per­for­mance tends to al­ter­nate among dif­fer­ent groups of eq­ui­ties, the one thing you must not do is to con­tinue to chase af­ter a group of eq­ui­ties that has done well for a long stretch of time. Yes, it is tempt­ing to want to put more money into stocks that have done well for you, be­liev­ing that they will con­tinue to do well. How­ever, the fact that they have done well means they have be­come more ex­pen­sive.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies are val­ued based on the earn­ings they are able to gen­er­ate. If a com­pany’s share price has risen to a level that is no longer sup­ported by its earn­ings, then its price will fall at some point.</p>
    <p>In the same vein, you should not aban­don say Asian eq­ui­ties or value strat­egy al­to­gether be­cause they have un­der­per­formed in the past few years. That they have un­der­per­formed means that they have be­come cheaper. In in­vest­ing, we want to pick up as­sets when they are cheap, or at least, if we can help it, not sell them when they are cheap.</p>
    <p>The key is to be clear about your long-term ob­jec­tive, know the facts about the mar­kets – that they move in cy­cles, ex­pen­sive as­sets will fall, and cheap as­sets will get bid up. Also, be dis­ci­plined and keep your emo­tions in check. This can­not be stressed of­ten enough: Man­ag­ing your emo­tions is an in­te­gral part of man­ag­ing your funds if you want to achieve your fi­nan­cial ob­jec­tive.</p>
    <p>As men­tioned, there is a wide va­ri­ety of funds out there. As an in­vestor, you can de­cide how to as­sem­ble your own port­fo­lio. That is, you can de­cide to choose a US fund you like, choose an Asia fund, a value fund, a growth fund, etc.</p>
    <p>Or, you can choose a global fund which will give you ac­cess to eq­ui­ties any­where in the world.</p>
    <p>Or, you may want more than just eq­ui­ties in your fund to fur­ther re­duce the volatil­ity. In which case, you may want to have high-grade or gov­ern­ment bonds in your funds as well. But the trade-off is lower re­turn.</p>
    <p>Just a note on volatil­ity. Many equate volatil­ity with risk. Volatil­ity is a risk only if your in­vest­ment hori­zon is short, say less than 10 years. The chances of an eq­uity in­dex hav­ing a neg­a­tive re­turn is al­most zero for hold­ing pe­ri­ods of 10 years or more.</p>
    <p>A more damn­ing char­ac­ter­is­tic of eq­ui­ties is their high syn­chronic­ity with the busi­ness cy­cle. This means that prices of eq­ui­ties tend to fall when times are bad, when busi­nesses are like­lier to fail, when em­ploy­ees are more likely to lose their jobs.</p>
    <p>If you are some­one whose in­come is tied to the gen­eral eco­nomic en­vi­ron­ment, then you can count on the eq­ui­ties mar­ket to pile on your mis­ery when times are bad. It is pre­cisely this rea­son that your fi­nan­cial as­sets will de­cline when you most likely need to tap them, that eq­ui­ties re­ward in­vestors with a pre­mium above the re­turns of other as­set classes. As one in­vest­ment writer noted: “No pain, no pre­mium.”</p>
    <p>In other words, if you are go­ing to al­lo­cate funds to eq­ui­ties, make sure that it is money you are sav­ing for the long term and are un­likely to tap in the short term when times are bad.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to the more con­ven­tional types of funds, there are also more so­phis­ti­cated funds which not only buy and hold as­sets or in­stru­ments, they can short (sell with­out own­ing) as­sets that they think are over-priced.</p>
    <p>The mar­kets they dab­ble in can in­clude eq­ui­ties, bonds, com­modi­ties, currencies and in­ter­est rates, while the in­stru­ments they use can range the plain vanilla ones to the more ex­otic de­riv­a­tives and struc­tured prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>As an in­vestor, the onus is on you to un­der­stand the strat­egy of the fund you are in­vest­ing in, the level of risk the man­ager is tak­ing, and the fees you are pay­ing.</p>
