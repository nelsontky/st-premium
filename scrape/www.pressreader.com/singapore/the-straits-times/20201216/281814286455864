    <p>Takahiro Shi­raishi, the man who used Twit­ter to lure sui­ci­dal women to his home, where he drugged, robbed, raped and killed them be­fore dis­mem­ber­ing their bod­ies, was yes­ter­day given the death penalty.</p>
    <p>Po­lice dis­cov­ered nine hu­man heads and 240 bones stored in cooler boxes in his tiny 13.5 sq m apart­ment on Hal­loween in 2017.</p>
    <p>His home in Zama city, 90 min­utes from cen­tral Tokyo, was dubbed by Ja­panese me­dia as the “house of hor­rors”.</p>
    <p>The nine mur­ders took place over three months from Au­gust to Oc­to­ber in 2017.</p>
    <p>Eight of the vic­tims were women aged 15 to 26. The only man was an ac­quain­tance of one of the miss­ing women, and was killed when he came too close to dis­cov­er­ing Shi­raishi’s crimes.</p>
    <p>Shi­raishi, now 30, pleaded guilty to all the charges against him dur­ing his trial, which spanned 23 hear­ings and cen­tred on his de­gree of cul­pa­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>His de­fence lawyers ar­gued that the mur­ders were “con­sen­sual” and should amount to the lesser charge of homi­cide with con­sent.</p>
    <p>“None of the vic­tims agreed to be killed. The de­fen­dant was found to be fully re­spon­si­ble,” pre­sid­ing judge Naokuni Yano said yes­ter­day as he sen­tenced Shi­raishi to death.</p>
    <p>“All the mur­ders were well planned and the modus operandi makes it one of the most ma­li­cious mur­ders ever in the his­tory of crime. It caused mas­sive shock and anx­i­ety to a so­ci­ety where the use of so­cial me­dia is com­mon­place.”</p>
    <p>Shi­raishi, who wore black­rimmed glasses and a white mask, was stone-faced and emo­tion­less dur­ing the 80 min­utes or so it took the judge to read the en­tire judg­ment, me­dia re­ports said.</p>
    <p>Judge Yano, turn­ing to Shi­raishi af­ter the ver­dict, asked if he was even lis­ten­ing. Shi­raishi replied: “Yes, I un­der­stand.”</p>
    <p>In me­dia in­ter­views lead­ing up to the ver­dict, he had com­plained that the process was tak­ing too long and that he would gladly ac­cept the death penalty.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing his trial, he apol­o­gised to some of the be­reaved fam­i­lies who took the stand, though he would not meet their eyes. “I am sorry for hav­ing killed some of the vic­tims, with whom I spent a lot of time, and would like to apol­o­gise to these fam­i­lies.”</p>
    <p>But he had also been de­fi­ant: “But for the oth­ers, I don’t re­ally feel a deep sense of re­gret. In any case, I am sorry only be­cause I failed when I got caught. If I wasn’t ar­rested, I will not be re­gret­ting any­thing.”</p>
    <p>Once a scout for the seedy sex in­dus­try in Shin­juku’s Kabu­ki­cho district, Shi­raishi had a flair for sweettalk­ing young women into do­ing his bid­ding.</p>
    <p>Job­less in 2017, he sought out sui­ci­dal women us­ing two Twit­ter ac­counts. In one, he posed as a sui­cide guru skilled at help­ing peo­ple end their lives. In the other, he cast him­self as a for­lorn man who wanted com­pany for his mis­ery, seek­ing out oth­ers with whom he could en­ter into sui­cide pacts.</p>
    <p>To en­sure his vic­tims would not back out at the last minute, he ar­ranged to meet them at a train sta­tion near their homes be­fore trav­el­ling to­gether to his apart­ment.</p>
    <p>There, he fed them al­co­hol, tran­quil­lis­ers and sleeping pills, be­fore as­sault­ing and rap­ing them.</p>
    <p>He killed his first vic­tim, a 21-year-old woman, af­ter she de­manded the re­turn of a loan. His sub­se­quent vic­tims, he said, were mur­dered be­cause he feared they would re­port his sex­ual as­sault on them.</p>
    <p>“There is no doubt that I sliced up the bod­ies in my bath­room with the in­ten­tion of de­stroy­ing ev­i­dence,” he once told po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tors. “I dis­posed of their flesh and in­ter­nal or­gans like garbage, but kept their bones out of fear that I would be caught.”</p>
    <p>Shi­raishi was found out only when the brother of the fi­nal vic­tim hacked into her Twit­ter ac­count and found the dis­turb­ing mes­sages.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tors said in clos­ing ar­gu­ments that Shi­raishi’s crimes “de­serve death”, adding: “Nine young lives were taken in such a short span of two months.”</p>
    <p>The father of one of Shi­raishi’s vic­tims said in an NHK in­ter­view: “Per­son­ally, I wanted him to get a life sen­tence over which he has no choice but to atone for his wrong­do­ings, rather than give him the death penalty he wanted.”</p>
