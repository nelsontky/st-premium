    <p>• Many crit­ics had ques­tioned Frank Lam­pard’s judg­ment in pick­ing up Thi­ago Silva on a free trans­fer from last sea­son’s Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal­ists Paris Sain­tGer­main in the sum­mer.</p>
    <p>The de­fender, 36, was pre­sumed to be too slow for the Premier League.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Chelsea have kept five con­sec­u­tive clean sheets in all com­pe­ti­tions – thanks to their im­prov­ing back­line mar­shalled by Silva.</p>
    <p>Given the con­gested fix­ture list due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, Lam­pard has been keen to wrap Silva in cot­ton wool so as to keep him fresh for top-flight ac­tion.</p>
    <p>The Brazil­ian was rested for last week’s Cham­pi­ons League win against Krasnodar and was taken off early in this week’s vic­tory over Rennes.</p>
    <p>His per­for­mances have not gone un­no­ticed – he was named yes­ter­day among seven oth­ers for Oc­to­ber’s Premier League Player of the Month award – and Lam­pard is de­lighted his de­ci­sion to plump for ex­pe­ri­ence is pay­ing off.</p>
    <p>“His English is im­prov­ing, par­tic­u­larly his words on the pitch. His in­flu­ence is clear. He trains well, pre­pares well and it’s very ob­vi­ous with him why he has had the ca­reer so far,” Lam­pard said at his vir­tual pre-match press con­fer­ence ahead of to­day’s home game with Sh­effield United.</p>
    <p>“We’ve made changes in per­son­nel. Thi­ago Silva is a player who brings an at­ti­tude that’s in­fec­tious. The play­ers are grow­ing... It’s a process and a test to see where we are to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>“There’s al­ways dif­fer­ent parts to it. In­di­vid­u­als have made good per­for­mances in that pe­riod. The col­lec­tive is re­flec­tion of that. It’s driven by the play­ers, al­ways will be. We must never re­lax.”</p>

    <p>Adrian</p>
    <p>Durham agreed with Lam­pard, com­par­ing Silva’s in­flu­ence to that of Vir­gil van Dijk at Liver­pool.</p>
    <p>“Thi­ago Silva, in a very dif­fer­ent way, is Chelsea’s van Dijk,” he said yes­ter­day. “It is be­cause of the lead­er­ship skills, they look up to him, don’t they?</p>
    <p>“If he stays fit and (goal­keeper Edouard) Mendy stays fit, I think they’ve got a very, very good chance of win­ning the ti­tle.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing earned just one point from seven games, the 19th-placed Blades are suf­fer­ing from a case of sec­ond-sea­son syn­drome, but Lam­pard warned his side that they can pose “a big chal­lenge” if they let their guard down.</p>
    <p>“They are an amaz­ing team, an in­cred­i­ble man­ager,” he added. “They are still a great team. A very tough match.”</p>
    <p>Lam­pard will be with­out mid­fielder Kai Havertz, who is iso­lat­ing af­ter catch­ing Covid-19 ear­lier this week, while Chris­tian Pulisic is out through in­jury.</p>
