    <p>• Mus­lims across Asia, tak­ing pre­cau­tions against the coro­n­avirus such as wear­ing face masks and tem­per­a­ture checks, per­formed prayers yes­ter­day to mark the fes­ti­val of Eid al-Adha i n mosques with re­duced ca­pac­ity as well as on the streets.</p>
    <p>In In­done­sia, wor­ship­pers were ad­vised to main­tain so­cial dis­tanc­ing dur­ing the prayers as the world’s big­gest Mus­lim-ma­jor­ity coun­try strug­gles to con­tain the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia’s re­li­gious min­istry also asked mosques to shorten cer­e­monies this year, while many mosques can­celled the rit­ual of slaugh­ter­ing live­stock and dis­tribut­ing meat to the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>In­stead the do­nated sheep, goats and cows will be killed in abat­toirs to mark the “Feast of the Sac­ri­fice”, cel­e­brated by Mus­lims around the world to com­mem­o­rate Prophet Abra­ham’s will­ing­ness to sac­ri­fice his son Is­mail at God’s com­mand.</p>
    <p>“This year’s Eid al-Adha is very dif­fer­ent from pre­vi­ous years be­cause we need to fol­low health pro­to­cols as we per­form prayers, like main­tain­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing,” said Ms De­vita Il­hami, 30, who was at the Sunda Ke­lapa Mosque in Jakarta.</p>
    <p>She also noted they had to bring their own prayer mats, with mark­ers on the ground to show where they should be laid.</p>
    <p>Else­where in Asia, Mus­lims in­clud­ing in Thai­land and Malaysia prayed in or out­side mosques wear­ing masks.</p>
    <p>In Malaysia, while some mosques can­celled the rit­ual of slaugh­ter­ing live­stock, 13 cows were killed in the tra­di­tional way by cut­ting their throat un­der rules lim­it­ing the num­ber of an­i­mals at the Tengku Ab­dul Aziz Shah Jamek Mosque in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Afghan Pres­i­dent Ashraf Ghani will at­tend prayers in Kabul. Tale­ban mil­i­tants have an­nounced they will ob­serve a three­day cease­fire for the hol­i­day, of­fer­ing some respite from weeks of in­creas­ing vi­o­lence in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>In In­dia, where Eid will be cel­e­brated mostly from to­day, sev­eral states have eased coro­n­avirus curbs to al­low wor­ship­pers to gather in mosques in lim­ited num­bers.</p>
    <p>“Only small groups of wor­ship­pers will be al­lowed into mosques,” said Mr Shafique Qasim, a se­nior cleric at the Nakhoda Mosque in the east­ern city of Kolkata, adding that no prayers would be held on the streets.</p>
    <p>Rit­ual sac­ri­fices would be per­formed in en­closed ar­eas, away from pub­lic view, and the re­mains col­lected and dis­posed of, he said.</p>
    <p>In south­ern Kar­nataka state, the au­thor­i­ties are re­quir­ing mosques to dis­in­fect their premises, use ther­mal scan­ners, pro­vide hand-wash­ing fa­cil­i­ties and en­sure in­di­vid­u­als main­tain a 2m safe dis­tance.</p>
    <p>Health ex­perts have been con­cerned about the risks of the coro­n­avirus be­ing spread dur­ing such re­li­gious fes­ti­vals, when Mus­lims typ­i­cally gather in mosques and homes, or travel to their home towns.</p>
