    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Fo­cus on sim­ple ba­sics like chores or or­gan­is­ing files. They are more im­por­tant than you may re­alise, but it is too easy to for­get about them.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Try to sched­ule a con­ver­sa­tion with some­one im­por­tant to you. You have some­thing he or she needs to hear. Choose your words wisely.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>You are spend­ing less freely now. If you are try­ing to save more, work out a bud­get you can stick to over the long term.</p>
    <p>Cancer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>You need to be more as­sertive and you have the right kind of en­ergy to break through ob­sta­cles. Go for some­thing you once thought was unattain­able.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Your in­tu­itive side is hy­per­ac­tive, send­ing you more sig­nals than you can fol­low eas­ily. Fo­cus on the stuff that seems to mat­ter most for now.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>This is not a good day to spend in iso­la­tion. Your peo­ple need you and that goes both ways as you find your­self ask­ing ques­tions that need big an­swers.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You have a lot go­ing on in your head, so make sure you do not have too many dis­trac­tions around you.</p>
    <p>A big de­ci­sion awaits.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Your brain is fir­ing on all cylin­ders, so you should find it eas­ier to work through big prob­lems. Make sure you are in the right place at the right time.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Things do not re­ally make sense on the sur­face, but you can put them into a frame­work that helps you un­der­stand them.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>A tiny change that you no­tice is al­most cer­tainly the har­bin­ger of some­thing big and likely pos­i­tive. Try not to trip your­self up in the de­tails.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Your big brain is a real as­set most of the time, but you need to let go of stray thoughts and try to push your­self in a bold new di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Your en­ergy is help­ing you cre­ate some­thing to­tally new. Some­one close is ready for a big change and you are the one who can de­liver on that promise.</p>
