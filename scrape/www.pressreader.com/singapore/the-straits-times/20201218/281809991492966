    <p>SEOUL • South Korea re­ported a record num­ber of coro­n­avirus deaths yes­ter­day as the coun­try’s big­gest wave of in­fec­tions since the start of the pan­demic strained hospi­tal re­sources and sparked panic buy­ing in an­tic­i­pa­tion of a harsh new lock­down.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus had claimed an­other 22 lives as at mid­night on Wed­nes­day, sharply up from a pre­vi­ous high of 13 deaths in a sin­gle day ear­lier in the week, the Korea Disease Con­trol and Preven­tion Agency (KDCA) re­ported.</p>
    <p>Deaths were ex­pected to rise af­ter in­fec­tions had spiked in Seoul and sur­round­ing ar­eas, with an­other 1,014 cases re­ported yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing a daily record of 423 in the cap­i­tal city.</p>
    <p>The most daily deaths in pre­vi­ous waves of in­fec­tions was nine, and for much of the year South Korea had man­aged to keep cases low through ag­gres­sive trac­ing and test­ing.</p>
    <p>This new wave emerged from mul­ti­ple clus­ters in Seoul, as well as in its densely pop­u­lated sub­urbs, chal­leng­ing trac­ing ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Tighter so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules have failed to re­verse the trend and the gov­ern­ment has warned it may have to im­pose harsher re­stric­tions on busi­ness ac­tiv­ity, though it says that move would only be a last re­sort.</p>
    <p>Many res­i­dents of Seoul have started stock­ing up on food and other es­sen­tial sup­plies in an­tic­i­pa­tion that the city will be locked down for the first time to halt the spread of the disease.</p>
    <p>“I have al­ready or­dered dozens of in­stant rice pack­ages on­line, and many of my friends and their fam­i­lies are rush­ing to large su­per­mar­kets,” one res­i­dent, who wanted to be known only by her sur­name, Lee, told Reuters.</p>
    <p>An­other res­i­dent said she had her hair cut shorter than usual be­cause she had heard that so­cial dis­tanc­ing would soon be tight­ened to Level 3, which would shut about 150,000 beauty and bar­ber shops across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment said it would give peo­ple plenty of warn­ing be­fore im­pos­ing Level 3 curbs.</p>
    <p>“There won’t be a sit­u­a­tion where all the su­per­mar­kets are closed and you can’t buy ne­ces­si­ties,” KDCA se­nior of­fi­cial Lee Sang-won told a brief­ing.</p>
    <p>Hos­pi­tals are at a break­ing point, with only three crit­i­cal care beds avail­able as at Wed­nes­day in greater Seoul, an area with a pop­u­la­tion of al­most 26 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>South Korea has now re­ported a to­tal of 46,453 cases of the coro­n­avirus, with 634 deaths.</p>
