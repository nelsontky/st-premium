    <p>LON­DON • Max Ver­stap­pen has ad­mit­ted that no­body can stop Mercedes ace Lewis Hamil­ton win­ning his sev­enth For­mula One world cham­pi­onship this sea­son.</p>
    <p>The Red Bull driver fin­ished se­cond and within sight of Hamil­ton at the Bri­tish Grand Prix on Sun­day, but that was also be­cause both the Bri­ton and his Fin­nish team­mate Valt­teri Bot­tas had punc­tured tyres to­wards the end of the race.</p>
    <p>When asked af­ter the sea­son’s fourth race if there are any real con­tenders to chal­lenge Hamil­ton, the Dutch­man sim­ply said: “No.”</p>
    <p>The Mercedes duo lead the stand­ings with Hamil­ton on 88 points, Bot­tas on 58 and Ver­stap­pen on 52.</p>
    <p>And with tyre com­pounds get­ting softer – and faster – for this week­end’s 70th An­niver­sary Grand Prix at the same Sil­ver­stone cir­cuit, Ver­stap­pen feels that Mercedes will again dom­i­nate.</p>
    <p>“It’s so big, come on!” he said, re­fer­ring to the gap to the Sil­ver Ar­rows in terms of car per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>“Maybe you find a tenth, or one and a half, but it’s not enough. I’m try­ing but it’s not pos­si­ble at the mo­ment. We have to keep work­ing.”</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton also ad­mit­ted that he would pre­fer some com­pe­ti­tion, say­ing: “I’d much, much pre­fer to be hav­ing a su­per-close bat­tle be­cause that’s what gets me go­ing.”</p>
    <p>Ver­stap­pen added that he had no re­grets about a late pit stop on Sun­day that won him a point for fastest lap but may have cost him vic­tory.</p>
    <p>He was in third place with Hamil­ton and Bot­tas seem­ingly head­ing for a com­fort­able one-two when he de­cided to go for the fastest lap bonus point on fresh tyres.</p>
    <p>Bot­tas then suf­fered a punc­ture on the penul­ti­mate lap that dropped him to 11th while Hamil­ton hung on to win af­ter his front left tyre burst on the last lap.</p>
    <p>Ver­stap­pen was too far be­hind to make up the dis­tance, clos­ing from 31 sec­onds back to five at the fin­ish.</p>
    <p>“I know ev­ery­one is ask­ing whether we should not have pit­ted for the soft tyre be­cause we could have won,” said the 22-year-old.</p>
    <p>“I don’t re­gret any­thing and I be­lieve we made the right de­ci­sion. Who knows if I would also have got a punc­ture. Mercedes de­served to win as they were faster than us.”</p>
    <p>Un­til the punc­tures, Ver­stap­pen’s race be­hind the two Mercedes had been so low on ex­cite­ment that he re­versed roles for fun and re­minded his race en­gi­neer to re­mem­ber to drink wa­ter and stay hy­drated. “Other than that I was just count­ing sheep,” he said.</p>
    <p>F1’s of­fi­cial tyre sup­plier Pirelli is aim­ing to get to the bot­tom of its tyre fail­ure, with McLaren’s Carlos Sainz also hav­ing a punc­tured tyre.</p>
    <p>“We will ob­vi­ously in­ves­ti­gate what hap­pened in the last few laps,” said Pirelli’s head of mo­tor sport Mario Isola. “It could be high wear be­cause tyres with 38 laps or</p>
    <p>NO KICK</p>
    <p>I’d much, much pre­fer to be hav­ing a su­per-close bat­tle be­cause that’s what gets me go­ing. ’’</p>
    <p>LEWIS HAMIL­TON, six-time For­mula One world cham­pion, on the lack of com­pe­ti­tion this sea­son.</p>
    <p>more on this cir­cuit are quite worn.</p>
    <p>“But it can also be de­bris be­cause some pieces of the front wing of Kimi (Raikko­nen) were on track. The tar­get is to have some­thing hope­fully by Tues­day at the lat­est.”</p>
    <p>Sainz’s team­mate Lando Nor­ris com­mented that the tyres needed con­stant man­age­ment through­out.</p>
    <p>He said: “It is even on lap one, you can’t push as much as you want. As soon as you feel an un­der­steer you just back out of it. Oth­er­wise you end up hav­ing a prob­lem like a lot of peo­ple have where the front tyre just pops off.”</p>
    <p>Mercedes chief Toto Wolff be­lieves his warn­ings against com­pla­cency are now jus­ti­fied be­cause of the tyre fail­ures.</p>
    <p>“We could have eas­ily lost two cars to­day, out of the points, and then the points ad­van­tage would have van­ished in a se­cond,” he said.</p>
    <p>“This is what I’m al­ways point­ing out, the cham­pi­onship is not over un­til it’s math­e­mat­i­cally im­pos­si­ble for any­body else to catch us, and the race isn’t over un­til the flag drops.”</p>
