    <p>SEOUL • In a film theatre near Seoul, scores of mid­dle-aged South Korean women in match­ing baby­blue T-shirts, hair bands and face masks in­scribed with the word “Hero” are scream­ing, singing along and tak­ing self­ies.</p>
    <p>They are some of the 135,000-mem­ber fan club of top male South Korean singer Lim Young-woong, gath­er­ing to watch Mr Trot: The Movie, a film fea­tur­ing him and other singers who per­form the coun­try’s old­est form of pop­u­lar mu­sic, com­monly called trot.</p>
    <p>Lim’s fan club is called Age of Hero, af­ter the 29-year-old singer’s name, which means hero in Korean.</p>
    <p>Once ridiculed as mu­sic for grannies, trot is mak­ing a come­back and many South Kore­ans, mostly in their 40s and older, are cheer­ing an al­ter­na­tive to K-pop idol mu­sic in one of the world’s fastest age­ing so­ci­eties.</p>
    <p>K-pop is a multi­bil­lion-dol­lar global mu­sic in­dus­try with bub­bly bands such as BTS and Black­pink en­joy­ing huge fan bases out­side South Korea.</p>
    <p>But at home, trot sign­ers per­form­ing old bal­lads have seen the big­gest in­crease in fans, ac­cord­ing to top por­tal web­site Daum, which analy­ses growth rates of fan clubs and their so­cial me­dia ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“Our coun­try is age­ing, but it is hard to find songs that bring emo­tional em­pa­thy for the elderly pop­u­la­tion be­cause the mu­sic is too idol-ori­ented” said Mr Park Woo-jung, 54, a mem­ber of Age of Hero.</p>
    <p>“But lis­ten­ing to Lim Young­woong, I find his voice beau­ti­ful and com­fort­ing,” he said, wear­ing the sky-blue Hero mask.</p>
    <p>Lim’s new sin­gle topped on­line mu­sic charts ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>Al­though con­sid­ered un­cool by young­sters, trot mu­sic has a broad na­tional fol­low­ing with a sto­ried his­tory of suc­cess go­ing back be­fore the birth of mod­ern K-pop.</p>
    <p>The mu­sic’s melan­cholic lyrics of un­re­quited love or yearn­ing played to a repet­i­tive beat have res­onated with baby boomers and re­tirees, the gen­er­a­tion that helped build Asia’s fourth-largest econ­omy.</p>
    <p>To­day, fans of the genre have be­come an eco­nomic force to reckon with and many use their un­lim­ited data plans to plug into stream­ing sites or vote for their favourite stars at awards, em­brac­ing the ways of K-pop fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>“Fan­dom of the mid­dle-aged and elderly is un­con­di­tional,” said pop cul­ture colum­nist Jung Duk-hyun. “They have time to lis­ten all day. They have money and think their stars en­er­gise their life, then ag­gres­sively in­vest by buy­ing and click­ing.”</p>
    <p>When Lim of Mr Trot be­came the model for a Ssangy­ong Mo­tor sport util­ity ve­hi­cle this year, sales surged 63 per cent in May and 98 per cent in June com­pared with the ve­hi­cle’s monthly av­er­age sales be­tween Jan­uary and April this year, the car­maker said.</p>
    <p>Mr Song Jong-choon is a fan of trot singer Song Ga-in, whose songs, he says, “heal his bro­ken soul”, es­pe­cially one about lost home towns that re­mind him of the coun­try­side home he left.</p>
    <p>He does not hes­i­tate a mo­ment to sup­port her career.</p>
    <p>“We are old and many of us are in our 50s who have eco­nomic power, so we usu­ally don’t mind the spend­ing. But, if you are a Kpop idol fan, you have to do a part­time job to buy a con­cert ticket,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Song is head of Song Ga-in’s fan club, Again, with 57,000 mem­bers and six re­gional chap­ters.</p>
    <p>The club has its own guide­book to show how to sub­scribe to stream­ing sites and click likes for her mu­sic videos.</p>
    <p>The liv­ing room of his apart­ment is dec­o­rated with gi­ant photos of the singer and mer­chan­dise in her sig­na­ture pink rang­ing from aprons to cush­ions with the singer’s pic­tures.</p>
    <p>Trot is un­likely to reach the global suc­cess of K-pop largely be­cause of the lan­guage bar­rier, but fans be­lieve their fan­dom as some­thing spe­cial, treat­ing their stars as if they are their own chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“BTS have their fan club Army, but we are Mom­mies,” said Ms Hwang Eun-jeong, a 52-year-old house­wife and a mem­ber of Lim’s fan club.</p>
