    <p>The sur­prise, eleventh-hour sus­pen­sion by China’s reg­u­la­tors of Ant Fi­nan­cial’s US$34 bil­lion (S$46 bil­lion) ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO) and dual list­ing in Shang­hai and Hong Kong, which was to take place yes­ter­day, was an ex­tra­or­di­nary de­vel­op­ment that sent shock waves through the in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial com­mu­nity. While the pre­cise rea­sons for the sus­pen­sion of what would have been his­tory’s big­gest stock mar­ket de­but are still vague, the Shang­hai Stock Exchange said in a state­ment that ma­jor is­sues were in­volved, in­clud­ing changes in the fi­nan­cial tech­nol­ogy reg­u­la­tory en­vi­ron­ment, which may cause Ant to be un­able to meet is­suance and list­ing con­di­tions or in­for­ma­tion dis­clo­sure re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>The state­ment fol­lowed a meet­ing be­tween Ant’s top man­age­ment and China’s cen­tral bank as well as its bank­ing reg­u­la­tors. In hind­sight, the tim­ing of Ant’s IPO, which at­tracted record or­ders, was far from per­fect. Over re­cent months, China’s reg­u­la­tors have been tight­en­ing con­trols over on­line lenders, such as by rais­ing cap­i­tal re­quire­ments and cap­ping loan rates. As re­cently as Mon­day, China’s bank­ing watch­dog re­leased draft rules that would force on­line lenders to hold a larger share of the loans they of­fer to­gether with banks on their own bal­ance sheets. Up to now, these lenders acted as in­ter­me­di­aries, leav­ing banks to bear the risk. There has also been a flurry of re­cent opin­ion pieces in Chi­nese of­fi­cial pub­li­ca­tions high­light­ing the fact that fin­techs and banks do not op­er­ate on a level play­ing field.</p>
    <p>One such ar­ti­cle by the head of con­sumer pro­tec­tion at the China Bank­ing and In­sur­ance Reg­u­la­tory Com­mis­sion warned against reg­u­la­tory ar­bi­trage and called out fin­techs for their ag­gres­sive mar­ket­ing prac­tices, ex­ag­ger­ated re­turns, in­suf­fi­cient risk warn­ing and du­bi­ous credit as­sess­ment stan­dards which raise the risk of ex­ces­sive debt among con­sumers, which are a high-risk group. But the tim­ing of the move against Ant was un­usual given that reg­u­la­tory is­sues could have been sorted out much ear­lier. It sug­gests that re­gard­less of size and rep­u­ta­tion, a cau­tious ap­proach is still needed when deal­ing with the coun­try’s reg­u­la­tors.</p>
    <p>Re­cent pub­lic state­ments by Ant’s founder Jack Ma dis­parag­ing China’s state-owned banks for their “pawn­shop men­tal­ity” and moves by China’s au­thor­i­ties to clip the wings of con­glom­er­ate-based fin­techs that play an out­sized role in the fi­nan­cial sys­tem could also have weighed on the de­ci­sion to sus­pend Ant’s list­ing. Ant Fi­nan­cial, and oth­ers, will there­fore have to ad­just to China’s emerg­ing reg­u­la­tory land­scape be­fore tap­ping the markets for fund­ing. Ant also needs to re­work its busi­ness model and re­visit its ex­pan­sion plans in South-east Asia. Mean­while, the main les­son of this sus­pended IPO is that China’s fi­nan­cial reg­u­la­tion re­mains a work in progress.</p>
