    <p>With re­stric­tions on so­cial gath­er­ings this fes­tive sea­son, at-home par­ties are be­com­ing smaller and spread out over a few days.</p>
    <p>Ms Subashini Balakrishn­an, 37, is used to hav­ing about 50 peo­ple over for ex­trav­a­gant Christ­mas par­ties at her con­do­minium in Boon Keng.</p>
    <p>Over the past four years, the head of mar­ket­ing and com­mu­ni­ca­tions at Sin­ga­pore Cen­tre for So­cial En­ter­prise has even hired car­ollers to per­form for guests.</p>
    <p>This year, how­ever, it will be a toned-down af­fair, with a se­ries of par­ties held over four days; home-cooked food from her kitchen, be­spoke cock­tails made by her hus­band, as well as a Zoom call with her brother’s fam­ily in Lon­don, who are un­able to make it back home for the fes­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Ital­ian ex­pa­tri­ate Guido Sudero, 43, who works in ship­ping, was sup­posed to head back to the north­ern port city of Genoa with his wife to cel­e­brate Christ­mas with his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>But de­spite be­ing grounded this year, they al­ready have a packed sched­ule of par­ties here from Dec 24 to 26.</p>
    <p>“I’ll prob­a­bly pick up a few bot­tles of wine and pas­tries from my usual – So France Bistro & Gourmet store – to take to friends’ places. I’m sad I won’t be able to see my fam­ily, but I get to cel­e­brate with my com­mu­nity here in­stead,” he says.</p>
    <p>For many oth­ers, gath­er­ings will be over Skype, What­sApp and</p>
    <p>FaceTime, with fam­ily mem­bers lo­cated or stranded over­seas, but that does not mean the booze will stop flow­ing.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor al­co­hol brands such as Moet Hen­nessy Di­a­geo (MHD), Wil­liam Grant & Sons (WGS) and Pernod Ri­card all note that de­spite travel and move­ment re­stric­tions, the de­mand for cheer is in­creas­ing as the cap­tive mar­kets hun­ker down for stay-home cel­e­bra­tions.</p>
    <p>The pent-up de­mand has re­sulted in a shift in con­sumer be­hav­iour, with more on­line pro­cure­ment and home con­sump­tion of al­co­hol.</p>
    <p>With in­ter­na­tional travel cur­tailed, Mr Kok Ping Lim, WGS’ coun­try man­ager and head of re-ex­port (Sin­ga­pore), notes that in­stead of buy­ing booze at air­port duty-free out­lets, there has been an in­crease in peo­ple sourc­ing their al­co­hol do­mes­ti­cally at brick- and-mor­tar stores and, in­creas­ingly, e-com­merce plat­forms such as Shopee, Lazada and GrabMart.</p>
    <p>MHD, whose port­fo­lio com­prises Krug, Ruinart, Dom Perignon, Veuve Clicquot and Moet & Chan­don cham­pagnes, has no­ticed a “dra­matic shift in con­sump­tion habits com­pared with pre­vi­ous years”.</p>
    <p>MHD Sin­ga­pore man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Claire Chiang says: “If you look at the cham­pagne cat­e­gory in par­tic­u­lar, while sales on trade are steady de­spite the 10.30pm drink­ing cur­few, growth off trade is wit­ness­ing sig­nif­i­cant growth year-on-year driven pri­mar­ily by e-com­merce.</p>
    <p>“In the ab­sence of travel and late-night venues, con­sumers are cel­e­brat­ing with their loved ones at home this year.”</p>
    <p>Pernod Ri­card Sin­ga­pore is rid­ing on the e-com­merce wave and go­ing all out with pro­mo­tions for home de­liv­ery on plat­forms such as Shopee and Lazada, push­ing for­mer Changi Air­port duty-free top sell­ers like Martell VSOP cognac and Chivas Re­gal 18 scotch whisky, as well as cases of Mumm cham­pagne.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, bars like At­las have seen brisk sales of fes­tive gin gift sets and a newly in­tro­duced cu­rated gin sub­scrip­tion box, which cus­tomers from over­seas are send­ing to their Sin­ga­pore­based ex­pa­tri­ate fam­ily mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Ms Na­dine Hos­ford, F&B di­rec­tor at At­las, says: “In par­tic­u­lar, Cu­rios­ity dry gin from New Zealand – which we spe­cially im­ported as it was not lo­cally avail­able – has been pop­u­lar among the New Zealand com­mu­nity and we reckon that about 70 per cent of the sets sold have been to New Zealan­ders.</p>
    <p>“We can see the heart­warm­ing mes­sages penned from fam­ily back home to bring a small piece of New Zealand to Sin­ga­pore as they can’t travel home this Christ­mas.”</p>
    <p>Fam­i­lies, like Ms Balakrishn­an’s, are sim­i­larly learn­ing to cre­ate new Christ­mas tra­di­tions with this year’s scaled-down ar­range­ments. Hav­ing also re­cently cel­e­brated Deep­avali the same way, she says she ap­pre­ci­ates the “qual­ity con­ver­sa­tions and one-on-one time with guests”.</p>
    <p>“My Christ­mas din­ner this year will be at 7.30pm so that my brother and his fam­ily can join us vir­tu­ally at lunchtime from Lon­don. I’ve also or­dered all the Christ­mas presents for his kids via Ama­zon and he has done the same for mine,” she says.</p>
    <p>“If any­thing, this year has proven that you can still have the cel­e­bra­tion, mu­sic and drinks and still do your best. This sit­u­a­tion is go­ing to be the new norm. If we don’t find a way to cel­e­brate, we’re go­ing to be wait­ing in­def­i­nitely for joy to come.”</p>
    <p>I’ll prob­a­bly pick up a few bot­tles of wine... to take to friends’ places. I’m sad I won’t be able to see my fam­ily, but I get to cel­e­brate with my com­mu­nity here in­stead.</p>
