    <p>• Over the last cou­ple of years, Rory Fer­reira, also known as avant-garde hip-hop artist R.A.P. Fer­reira, no­ticed that on Discogs, an on­line record mar­ket­place that spe­cialises in re­sales, the phys­i­cal ver­sions of his al­bums were trad­ing for sev­eral times their orig­i­nal price.</p>
    <p>So when plan­ning t he vinyl re­lease of his lat­est al­bum, Pur­ple Moon­light Pages, he de­cided to charge ac­cord­ingly.</p>
    <p>“I’m not go­ing to knock any­one’s hus­tle. I just need to make sure mine is cal­i­brated ac­cord­ingly too,” he said in a tele­phone in­ter­view last month.</p>
    <p>Last month, he of­fered the Pur­ple Moon­light Pages vinyl for US$77 (S$105), an un­usu­ally high price, even for a dou­ble LP. Although the al­bum had been avail­able on stream­ing ser­vices for months, he sold all 1,500 copies avail­able on his web­site.</p>
    <p>Charg­ing US$77 for an al­bum might be a reach even in the best of times, but it is es­pe­cially am­bi­tious in the cur­rent mu­sic busi­ness cli­mate, where the al­bum it­self has be­come in­creas­ingly de­val­ued.</p>
    <p>The growth of sub­scrip­tion stream­ing ser­vices such as Spo­tify and Ap­ple Mu­sic has, in un­der a decade, al­most com­pletely de­tached al­bums and songs from a spe­cific dol­lar value.</p>
    <p>So what, if any­thing, is an al­bum truly worth this year? It de­pends on the busi­ness model.</p>
    <p>“I do think mu­sic has value, but the value is not on the mon­e­tary side,” said Mr Steve Car­less, the busi­ness part­ner and co-man­ager of rap­per Nipsey Hus­sle, who was killed in March last year. “Tech­nol­ogy has de­te­ri­o­rated that.”</p>
    <p>Thanks to the ab­strac­tion of the artist from the mu­sic on stream­ing ser­vices, and the rise of so­cial me­dia and the in­ti­macy it cre­ates be­tween stars and fans, phys­i­cal mu­sic is no longer the pri­mary way artists cap­ture their fol­low­ers’ at­ten­tion and dol­lars.</p>
    <p>“Mu­sic has now be­come the ve­hi­cle,” Mr Car­less added. “Be­fore, it was what was at the end of the equa­tion. Now, it’s at the be­gin­ning of the equa­tion.”</p>
    <p>In short: For the most pop­u­lar artists, the al­bum it­self is just one small part of a multi-plat­form busi­ness and nowhere near be­ing the most prof­itable one.</p>
    <p>While they still do a healthy busi­ness in phys­i­cal sales and some­times find ways to squeeze ad­di­tional prof­its from it – pop star Taylor Swift re­cently of­fered eight dif­fer­ent deluxe edi­tions of her new al­bum, Folk­lore – gen­er­ally the al­bum is the thing that sets the ta­ble for far more am­bi­tious rev­enue streams: tour­ing, mer­chan­dise, li­cens­ing and more.</p>
    <p>That is at one ex­treme.</p>
    <p>At the other are small artists or la­bels with de­voted fan bases, for whom the al­bum re­mains at the cen­tre of the fi­nan­cial con­ver­sa­tion, and still a lu­cra­tive propo­si­tion on its own.</p>
    <p>All of which is to say that it is harder than ever to de­ter­mine, in a pure sense, the value of an al­bum.</p>
    <p>Un­like in the CD or LP eras, when the mar­ket prices for records were es­sen­tially con­sis­tent, now the al­bum is val­ued on a slid­ing scale – for most peo­ple, us­ing stream­ing ser­vices, ac­cess to an al­bum is (or feels) free. The most ded­i­cated, how­ever, will put their money where their fan­dom is.</p>
    <p>This has wreaked havoc on record la­bel busi­ness mod­els, and also on the Bill­board charts.</p>
    <p>In or­der to en­cour­age im­me­di­ate sales, artists look­ing for an open­ing week No. 1 be­gan bundling al­bums with other, higher-priced items. Nowa­days, an artist’s al­bum re­lease can of­ten look more like the open­ing of a cloth­ing store.</p>
    <p>But this is a re­cent de­vel­op­ment. Be­fore the stream­ing era, artists were at­tempt­ing to ex­tract max­i­mum value from the al­bum it­self.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the high­est-pro­file ex­am­ple is the Wu-Tang Clan al­bum, Once Upon A Time In Shaolin.</p>
    <p>The hip-hop group made one copy of it avail­able and it sold at auc­tion in 2015 for US$2 mil­lion to since-dis­graced phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal ex­ec­u­tive Martin Shkreli, who sur­ren­dered it to the US au­thor­i­ties in 2018. Part of the in­spi­ra­tion for the Wu-Tang auc­tion was the re­lease of Hus­sle’s 2013 mix­tape, Cren­shaw.</p>
    <p>Hus­sle, per­haps the first artist in the mod­ern era to pro­pose a pre­mium pric­ing model for a dy­ing medium, of­fered phys­i­cal copies of Cren­shaw for US$100, us­ing the slo­gan “Proud2Pay”. He sold out 1,000 copies.</p>
    <p>To demon­strate that the Cren­shaw re­lease was not a fluke, he upped the ante with his next re­lease, Mail­box Money, of­fer­ing 100 copies at US$1,000. All of them sold out too.</p>
    <p>Hus­sle un­der­stood that the phys­i­cal al­bum was no longer a mu­sic de­liv­ery sys­tem, but a proxy for fan en­thu­si­asm, a merch totem of its own.</p>
    <p>This was an es­pe­cially key de­vel­op­ment in an era when phys­i­cal sales were in de­cline and stream­ing ser­vices were on the verge of in­sert­ing them­selves as cru­cial mid­dle­men be­tween artists and fans.</p>
    <p>Mr Car­less de­scribed Hus­sle’s in­tent as court­ing those lis­ten­ers who were pas­sion­ate and re­sourced enough to pay.</p>
    <p>The CD it­self, num­bered and signed, be­came “an im­por­tant keep­sake”, Mr Car­less said, and it came with cer­tain fan priv­i­leges – a phone number they could use to reach Hus­sle or a pri­vate con­cert.</p>
    <p>What this un­der­scores is some­thing Hus­sle knew, and some­thing rock band Ra­dio­head fig­ured out more than a decade ago: There are tiers of fans. Some – most, ac­tu­ally – will pay noth­ing for mu­sic. But the few who are will­ing to pay can more than off­set them.</p>
    <p>In 2007, Ra­dio­head re­leased its sev­enth al­bum, In Rain­bows, via a pay-what-you-wish down­load, and in var­i­ous phys­i­cal for­mats. Three mil­lion peo­ple paid for a copy.</p>
    <p>On the on­line record mar­ket­place Band­camp, around 80,000 al­bums are sold a day.</p>
    <p>Half of them are dig­i­tal: The av­er­age price for those al­bums – many of which are pay-what-youwish – is US$9, though, ac­cord­ing to Mr Joshua Kim, chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer of Band­camp, some fans will vol­un­tar­ily pay sev­eral times that. In one case, a fan paid US$1,000 for an al­bum.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim said the fastest grow­ing part of Band­camp’s busi­ness is phys­i­cal sales, par­tic­u­larly vinyl.</p>
    <p>“We view Band­camp as a place where mu­sic is val­ued as art. Phys­i­cal for­mats are prob­a­bly the most con­crete ex­pres­sion of that.”</p>
    <p>He likened con­sumers will­ing to pay a pre­mium for mu­sic they can other­wise get for free to those who shop for or­ganic food or eth­i­cally sourced cloth­ing, find­ing value in “com­pen­sat­ing artists fairly”.</p>
    <p>De­spite the push­back he re­ceived from some fans, Fer­reira does not view his US$77 vinyl as a pre­mium prod­uct. He said he val­ues these new­est songs, which were more ex­pen­sive for him to make and re­flect greater ma­tu­rity as an artist, more highly than his older tunes and felt that should be re­flected in the price.</p>
    <p>“The mu­sic is the pre­mium prod­uct. It’s just that there are some peo­ple who are at a place in their life where it’s kind of nice to be able to style out and buy some­thing nice that you be­lieve in.”</p>
    <p>Thanks to the ab­strac­tion of the artist from the mu­sic on stream­ing ser­vices, and the rise of so­cial me­dia and the in­ti­macy it cre­ates be­tween stars and fans, phys­i­cal mu­sic is no longer the pri­mary way artists cap­ture their fol­low­ers’ at­ten­tion and dol­lars.</p>
