    <p>Trans­port-re­lated apps are be­ing rolled out in a flurry, with around half a dozen new ones – in as many weeks – now vy­ing for taps.</p>
    <p>The new­est app on the block is trans­port en­gi­neer­ing group Gold­bell’s ST33R (a play on Steer), which is touted as a “flex­i­ble, per­son­alised and trans­par­ent” car leas­ing app with flat monthly fees, start­ing as low as $1,280 for a Mazda 3.</p>
    <p>The price in­cludes full main­te­nance and ser­vic­ing, com­pre­hen­sive in­surance, road tax, ve­hi­cle in­spec­tion, and round-the-clock ac­ci­dent and break­down sup­port.</p>
    <p>Gold­bell’s manag­ing di­rec­tor of fu­ture mo­bil­ity Kelvin Tay said: “By launch­ing Sin­ga­pore’s first fully dig­i­tal car sub­scrip­tion app, we are tak­ing the lead in ac­cel­er­at­ing the au­to­mo­tive in­dus­try’s crit­i­cal shift to­wards a ‘dig­i­tal-first’ men­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>“With monthly fees typ­i­cally more af­ford­able than short-term car rentals, ST33R has been de­signed to meet dif­fer­ent bud­gets and de­mo­graphic needs.”</p>
    <p>Sub­scribers have a choice of more than 500 cars, rang­ing from com­pacts to sport util­ity ve­hi­cles to lux­ury lin­ers.</p>
    <p>While car sub­scrip­tion mod­els are not ex­actly new – with car­mak­ers such as BMW and Audi of­fer­ing their own ver­sions of it – Gold­bell said its ver­sion is has­sle-free and pa­per­less.</p>
    <p>Next is Shar­iot, a car-shar­ing app tar­geted at heart­landers, with short-term rentals from as low as $1 per hour – a premise first of­fered by Tribecar, another lo­cal firm.</p>
    <p>Shar­iot said its users can rent a car for as short a pe­riod as 15 min­utes to “as long as they need, with­out any mileage caps”.</p>
    <p>Ger­man multi­na­tional car rental firm Sixt has also jumped on the band­wagon. It has launched Sixt Sin­ga­pore Limou­sine, a ride-hail­ing app it pro­fesses to be safer be­cause it uses ve­hi­cles that are less than five years old. Pre­mium ser­vice us­ing Mercedes-Benz Eclass and above will also come with acrylic shields which sep­a­rate driv­ers and pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>Sixt has part­nered lo­cal start-up Spur to al­low its driv­ers more av­enues for book­ings. Spur is an ag­gre­ga­tor that lets com­muters com­pare rates among ride-hail­ing providers.</p>
    <p>Spur chief tech­ni­cal of­fi­cer Ti­mothy Khor said a new al­go­rithm has just been im­ple­mented which “pre­dicts prices more ac­cu­rately”.</p>
    <p>“Along the way, we have also in­cor­po­rated other func­tion­al­i­ties like favourite places and a port­fo­lio view for our cus­tomers to see their spend,” he added.</p>
    <p>Else­where, mo­tor trader Mo­tor­way will be launch­ing GetGo, yet another car-shar­ing app, in the first quar­ter of next year. It plans to start with 200 to 300 cars, with an even­tual tar­get fleet of 1,000.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Rida is a new de­liv­ery app which re­duces cost by pool­ing or­ders. Rida stands for real-time im­me­di­ate de­liv­ery AI (ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence).</p>
    <p>Con­sumers can save up to 30 per cent in de­liv­ery charges by batch­ing their or­ders within fixed time slots. Rida founder Hyun Kim said: “We batch prod­ucts with­out com­pro­mis­ing qual­ity. For ex­am­ple, if it is fresh food, there will be no stops in be­tween.”</p>
    <p>He said the app of­fers im­me­di­ate de­liv­er­ies at rates which are “sim­i­lar to next-day-de­liv­ery prices”.</p>
    <p>Even ve­hi­cle work­shops are join­ing the app fray. Com­fortDelGro En­gi­neer­ing has launched what it claims to be Sin­ga­pore’s first endto-end work­shop app.</p>
    <p>The CDGE app aims to make car re­pair and main­te­nance sim­pler and more con­ve­nient.</p>
    <p>Mo­torists can book an ap­point­ment, mon­i­tor the progress of all re­pairs and be alerted when their car is ready for col­lec­tion.</p>
