    <p>OR­LANDO • The Los An­ge­les Lak­ers are play­ing in the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) play-offs for only the first time in seven sea­sons, and it is clear that the tar­get is to win their first cham­pi­onship since 2010 as soon as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>But LeBron James in­sisted that what is most im­por­tant for the team is steady progress, af­ter see­ing his side beat the Port­land Trail Blaz­ers 131-122 on Saturday to win their first-round play-off se­ries.</p>
    <p>“We got bet­ter through­out the course of the se­ries,” the for­ward, who has never l ost in the first round, go­ing 14-0, told ESPN.</p>
    <p>“We knew we were com­ing into a se­ries ver­sus a hot Port­land team that was play­ing the best bas­ket­ball in­side the bub­ble along with Phoenix. So we wanted to just come in and try to work our game, get bet­ter and bet­ter as the games went on, as the se­ries went on.”</p>
    <p>He scored 36 points, while An­thony Davis had 43 to lead the Lak­ers to win the Western Con­fer­ence se­ries 4-1 af­ter los­ing the first game.</p>
    <p>Davis was on 14-of-18 shoot­ing and col­lected nine re­bounds, while James made 14 of 19 shots and recorded 10 re­bounds and 10 as­sists to in­crease his play-offs 30-point, triple-dou­bles record to 13.</p>
    <p>Los An­ge­les won a play-off se­ries for the first time since beat­ing the</p>
    <p>Den­ver Nuggets in the first round in 2012. The Lak­ers will next face ei­ther the Hous­ton Rock­ets or the Ok­la­homa City Thun­der. The Rock­ets lead their se­ries 3-2.</p>
    <p>C.J. McCol­lum recorded 36 points and seven as­sists and Carmelo An­thony added 27 points for the Trail Blaz­ers, who were with­out Damian Lil­lard in the Dis­ney World cam­pus at Or­lando, Florida. The five-time All-Star re­turned to Port­land to have his sprained right knee ex­am­ined af­ter Game 4.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the game, James de­scribed 2020 as the worst year of his life, af­ter los­ing two of his black heroes just seven months apart.</p>
    <p>He hon­oured ac­tor Chad­wick Bose­man be­fore tip-off by fold­ing his arms across his chest in the Wakanda salute from the Black Pan­ther movie. Bose­man, star of the ground-break­ing su­per­hero block­buster, died from can­cer aged 43 last week. His death comes af­ter Lak­ers icon Kobe Bryant died in a he­li­copter crash in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>“To lose the Black Pan­ther and the Black Mamba in the same year, we can all agree that 2020 is the (ex­ple­tive) year... in my 35 years, there is no ques­tion,” said James.</p>
    <p>He also talked about step­ping up his lead­er­ship both on and off the court in the NBA’s pan­demic bub­ble, us­ing his plat­form to ig­nite so­cial jus­tice change in com­mu­ni­ties across the United States.</p>
    <p>“It is great to be back on the floor. But more im­por­tant, it is good to have a (so­cial jus­tice) plan and ex­e­cute it and put into ac­tion right away,” he said.</p>
    <p>Last week, he helped ne­go­ti­ate the NBA’s restart af­ter the play­ers de­cided to boy­cott three days of play-off games fol­low­ing the shoot­ing of Ja­cob Blake, a black man, by po­lice in Wis­con­sin.</p>
    <p>The Mil­wau­kee Bucks also pow­ered into the sec­ond round of the play-offs on Saturday, three days af­ter their re­fusal to take the court in the wake of the po­lice shoot­ing.</p>
    <p>Reign­ing NBA Most Valu­able Player Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo scored 28 points and grabbed 17 re­bounds and the Bucks led by as many as 21 on the way to a 118-104 vic­tory over the Or­lando Magic.</p>
    <p>Mil­wau­kee won the Eastern Con­fer­ence se­ries 4-1 to line up a sec­ond-round clash with the Mi­ami Heat, who swept the In­di­ana Pac­ers.</p>
