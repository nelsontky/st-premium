    <p>HONG KONG • The exit routes are mapped out, off­shore bank ac­counts opened and over­seas pass­ports se­cured.</p>
    <p>But for now, Hong Kong’s high­net-worth in­vestors are mostly stay­ing put, eas­ing fears that the city’s new na­tional se­cu­rity law would un­leash a flood of cap­i­tal out­flows.</p>
    <p>With­drawals have been min­i­mal since the law took ef­fect on June 30, in part be­cause rich in­vestors are still as­sess­ing how the Chi­nese govern­ment’s tighter grip on Hong Kong will af­fect as­set prices and the long-term busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment, ac­cord­ing to ex­ec­u­tives at four of Asia’s big­gest wealth man­agers who asked not to be iden­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>While crit­ics of the leg­is­la­tion have ar­gued it will un­der­mine Hong Kong’s role as a fi­nan­cial cen­tre, some wealthy in­vestors are open to an al­ter­nate nar­ra­tive – es­poused by Hong Kong’s govern­ment and the city’s rich­est ty­coons – that the law will help sta­bilise an econ­omy bat­tered by months of pro-democ­racy protests.</p>
    <p>That view has been re­in­forced by signs of tacit sup­port from Bei­jing, in­clud­ing record pur­chases of Hong Kong stocks by Chi­nese funds and high-pro­file list­ings by the na­tion’s tech­nol­ogy gi­ants.</p>
    <p>“While peo­ple are prob­a­bly open­ing over­seas ac­counts and con­sid­er­ing leav­ing, their prepa­ra­tion won’t lead to a ma­jor ex­o­dus of cap­i­tal yet,” said Hong Kong-based wealth man­age­ment strate­gist Kenny Wen at Ever­bright Sun Hung Kai.</p>
    <p>“Money is mov­ing into Hong Kong... be­cause in­vestors are bullish on Hong Kong’s stock mar­ket, espe­cially the new list­ings.”</p>
    <p>Whether the san­guine out­look will last is any­one’s guess, espe­cially with Hong Kong caught in the cross­fire of an in­ten­si­fy­ing clash be­tween China and the US.</p>
    <p>But the up­shot since June has been a strong Hong Kong currency, a re­silient prop­erty mar­ket and steady stock prices. Cap­i­tal in­flows have been so big re­cently that the au­thor­i­ties in­ter­vened to pre­vent the lo­cal currency from breach­ing the strong end of its trad­ing band, a far cry from the dooms­day sce­nario pre­dicted by Hong Kong bears like US hedge fund man­ager Kyle Bass.</p>
    <p>Many rich in­vestors who have kept their money in the city have cited ex­pec­ta­tions that China’s govern­ment will act to prop up Hong Kong mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Mr Bahren Shaari, CEO at Bank of Sin­ga­pore, said most are “tak­ing a wait-and-see ap­proach”. He told Bloomberg Tele­vi­sion yes­ter­day: “There are mea­sures they are tak­ing to make sure they have po­si­tioned them­selves if the event turns out worse than ex­pected or bet­ter than ex­pected.”</p>
    <p>In­flows into the city’s stocks through main­land ex­change links more than dou­bled from a year ear­lier to US$16.6 bil­lion (S$22.8 bil­lion) since early June, fu­elling spec­u­la­tion that state-owned Chi­nese funds are buy­ing.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, reg­u­la­tors in June kicked off a long-an­tic­i­pated pro­gramme called Wealth Man­age­ment Con­nect, which is set to fur­ther boost in­flows by al­low­ing res­i­dents in south­ern China to in­vest in Hong Kong and vice versa.</p>
    <p>“We can fore­see even more busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties and greater growth head­room for Hong Kong’s fi­nan­cial in­dus­try,” Mr Eddie Yue, CEO of the Hong Kong Mone­tary Au­thor­ity, said last month. “As we all know, a safe and sta­ble so­cial en­vi­ron­ment is what ev­ery in­vestor looks for and finds com­fort in.”</p>
    <p>Of course, the op­ti­mistic tone in mar­kets could change quickly if China’s im­ple­men­ta­tion of the se­cu­rity law proves harsher than ex­pected. Most of the city’s rich in­vestors are ready to with­draw as­sets at a mo­ment’s no­tice, even though the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has made em­i­grat­ing harder.</p>
    <p>Tech gi­ants in­clud­ing Face­book and Al­pha­bet’s Google are as­sess­ing the im­pact of the leg­is­la­tion while some nim­ble start-ups are al­ready mov­ing data and peo­ple out. About half of US busi­nesses said the law made them feel less safe, ac­cord­ing to a re­cent sur­vey by the Amer­i­can Cham­ber of Com­merce in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Wealthy in­vestors “would start leav­ing Hong Kong with their</p>
    <p>money if some­one is charged un­der the na­tional se­cu­rity law for do­ing noth­ing re­lated to sub­ver­sion”, said Mr Jac­into Tong, CEO of the Hong Kong-based real es­tate in­vest­ment firm Gale Well Group.</p>
    <p>Other oft-cited red lines in­clude cap­i­tal con­trols and re­stricted ac­cess to the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, wealthy in­di­vid­u­als who want ex­po­sure to China’s bud­ding eco­nomic re­cov­ery see lit­tle rea­son to ditch Hong Kong. The city is still an un­ri­valled hub for buy­ing ev­ery­thing from Chi­nese shares and dol­lar bonds to fi­nan­cial de­riv­a­tives. And with China now ahead of many na­tions in get­ting back on its feet from the pan­demic, many are loath to leave money on the ta­ble.</p>
    <p>“If you’re bullish on China, it’s hard to jus­tify why you would want to pull your money out,” said Mr Ben­jamin Quin­lan, CEO of Quin­lan & As­so­ci­ates, a con­sul­tancy in Hong Kong.</p>
