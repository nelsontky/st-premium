    <p>More home-based food busi­nesses are open­ing amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic as Covid-19 re­stric­tions are be­ing eased.</p>
    <p>Mr Xavier Lee, who runs Flour­crafts from his home, wel­comes the com­pe­ti­tion, which he sees as healthy. But just as im­por­tant is up­lift­ing one an­other, he said.</p>
    <p>“A lot of us say #Sup­port­Lo­cal but I’d add the hash­tag #Sup­port</p>
    <p>OneAnother,” said Mr Lee, who is known for his cane­les.</p>
    <p>He was speaking at an askST@NLB ses­sion hosted by The Straits Times’ food ed­i­tor Tan Hsueh Yun that was streamed on the ST Face­book page yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>To­gether with Ms Karen Yuen, the founder of Munch-Kins, they dis­cussed how home-based food busi­nesses can sup­port one an­other and do well.</p>
    <p>Both speak­ers also rec­om­mended home-based busi­nesses they reg­u­larly buy from, such as shell­fish spe­cial­ist Eat Hum and home bak­ery Three Bears Bake.</p>
    <p>Those who missed the talk can find a video record­ing of it at str.sg/askstnlb, where videos of pre­vi­ous askST@NLB ses­sions can also be found.</p>
    <p>The talks are a col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween The Straits Times and Na­tional Li­brary Board.</p>
    <p>STAND­ING OUT FROM THE CROWD</p>
    <p>With restau­rants and cafes back in busi­ness, Mr Lee said home bak­ers and cooks may see their or­ders de­clin­ing.</p>
    <p>But he noted that home-based food busi­nesses are more nim­ble and can switch their of­fer­ings eas­ily, un­like big­ger play­ers who of­ten buy their in­gre­di­ents in bulk.</p>
    <p>To stand out from the crowd, Mr Lee and Ms Yuen are in­no­va­tive with the in­gre­di­ents they use.</p>
    <p>For his pas­tries, Mr Lee sources matcha from Ky­oto, Ja­pan, so that he can se­cure higher-grade matcha for his cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>“It’s a tad more ex­pen­sive, but at least I give them what they want,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Yuen, whose sig­na­ture of­fer­ing is her steamed daikon cake, uses, among other in­gre­di­ents, Korean and Ja­panese radishes, Jin­hua ham and dried sakura ebi.</p>
    <p>MAK­ING CUS­TOMERS HAPPY</p>
    <p>In­ter­act­ing with happy cus­tomers is one of the most sat­is­fy­ing parts of run­ning a home-based food busi­ness, said Ms Yuen.</p>
    <p>Some of her cus­tomers fin­ish her daikon cake at one go, within hours of col­lect­ing it from her home. “They would send me a mes­sage to say (they’ve) fin­ished ev­ery­thing, it’s so good. That makes me so happy,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee also puts great store by build­ing a deeper con­nec­tion with cus­tomers, as this gives home­based food busi­nesses an edge.</p>
    <p>START­ING A HOME-BASED FOOD BUSI­NESS</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to an ST reader’s ques­tion, both speak­ers held up so­cial me­dia mar­ket­ing as an im­por­tant plat­form.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Lee: “Most im­por­tantly, it’s whether (the food) is In­sta­grammable... can you make it look el­e­gant or invit­ing?”</p>
    <p>Ms Yuen pointed to food de­liv­ery as a challenge as it can be dif­fi­cult to en­sure a dish still looks good af­ter it ar­rives at the cus­tomer’s home.</p>
    <p>The next askST@NLB ses­sion will be on Jan 25, with Eng­lish/ Malay/Tamil Me­dia group video cre­ative di­rec­tor Jonathan Roberts, who will share tips on mak­ing movies with a smart­phone. Ques­tions on the topic can be sub­mit­ted at https://str.sg/JaLa by Jan 21.</p>
