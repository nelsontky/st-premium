    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy re­bounded in the third quar­ter from the dol­drums of the cir­cuit breaker, but the out­look through next year re­mains un­cer­tain. The Repub­lic’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct rose by</p>
    <p>7.9 per cent in the July to Septem­ber pe­riod, com­pared with the pre­vi­ous quar­ter on a sea­son­ally ad­justed ba­sis.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy re­bounded in the third quar­ter from the dol­drums of the cir­cuit breaker, but the out­look through next year re­mains un­cer­tain.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) rose by 7.9 per cent in the July to Septem­ber pe­riod, com­pared with the pre­vi­ous quar­ter on a sea­son­ally ad­justed ba­sis, ac­cord­ing to ad­vance es­ti­mates re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The re­bound came on the heels of the “lost” April-June quar­ter, when the need to curb the coro­n­avirus spread re­quired strict re­stric­tions on mo­bil­ity and busi­ness ac­tiv­ity, and caused the GDP to plunge 13.2 per cent quar­ter on quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI) pointed out yes­ter­day that the phased reopening of the econ­omy that started in June con­tributed to its im­proved show­ing in the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>High­light­ing the fact that Sin­ga­pore is still in the midst of its worst re­ces­sion, MTI data showed the econ­omy shrank 7 per cent, com­pared with the same quar­ter last year.</p>
    <p>This in­di­cated that the pace of de­cline reg­is­tered in the sec­ond quar­ter – when the econ­omy nose­dived 13.3 per cent com­pared with a year ear­lier – had been ar­rested.</p>
    <p>Pol­i­cy­mak­ers, how­ever, re­mained cau­tious and MTI did not re­vise its full-year GDP fore­cast range, which en­vis­ages the econ­omy shrink­ing be­tween 5 per cent and 7 per cent.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mists, in­clud­ing Mr Irvin Seah of DBS Bank, said the quar­terly num­bers sug­gested that the worst of the re­ces­sion has passed, even though the cen­tral bank ex­pects a hard slog next year.</p>
    <p>“The worst is over for the econ­omy, and the third quar­ter marks the start of the re­cov­ery from the Covid-19 pan­demic,” Mr Seah said.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts be­lieve man­u­fac­tur­ing will re­main a key driver of growth.</p>
    <p>The sec­tor grew 2 per cent year on year, re­vers­ing a 0.8 per cent drop in the sec­ond quar­ter, backed by ro­bust global de­mand for semi­con­duc­tors and semi­con­duc­tor man­u­fac­tur­ing equip­ment.</p>
    <p>The con­struc­tion sec­tor was the big­gest drag on growth.</p>
    <p>It shrank 44.7 per cent year on year amid the slow re­sump­tion of con­struc­tion ac­tiv­i­ties due to the need to im­ple­ment mea­sures for a safe restart through most of the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The ser­vices sec­tor shrank by 8 per cent year on year.</p>
    <p>While that was an im­prove­ment from the 13.6 per cent drop in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter, the out­look re­mains murky, with no end in sight to travel re­stric­tions that have hit the avi­a­tion and hos­pi­tal­ity sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Ms Selena Ling, head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy at OCBC Bank, said that even the re­tail and food ser­vices seg­ments may con­tinue to strug­gle due to a weak labour mar­ket, which hits con­sumer con­fi­dence and spend­ing.</p>
    <p>Doubts on the eco­nomic out­look were also ex­pressed by the Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) in a sep­a­rate state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>As widely ex­pected, the cen­tral bank kept its pol­icy stance of zero ap­pre­ci­a­tion of the trade-weighted Sin­ga­pore dol­lar un­changed.</p>
    <p>But it also went ahead to warn that quar­ter-on-quar­ter growth may mod­er­ate go­ing for­ward, with most sec­tors ex­pected to re­cover to pre-pan­demic lev­els only by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>Mr Ed­ward Lee, chief economist for Asean and South Asia at Stan­dard Char­tered Bank, said that from the MAS’ per­spec­tive, there were sev­eral ar­eas of con­cern as the econ­omy heads into 2021.</p>
    <p>They in­clude soft labour mar­ket con­di­tions and wor­ries over a global resur­gence of Covid-19 in­fec­tions lead­ing to the reim­po­si­tion of lock­down mea­sures that may weigh down con­sumer and busi­ness sen­ti­ment, he added.</p>
    <p>Still, most an­a­lysts agreed that the Gov­ern­ment’s fis­cal mea­sures, in­clud­ing jobs sup­port schemes, would con­tinue to pro­vide a floor to the econ­omy and cush­ion it from the worst ef­fects of the pan­demic­driven re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket ex­pec­ta­tions that the cen­tral bank would leave its pol­icy on the Sin­ga­pore dol­lar un­changed were right on the money yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It an­nounced that it would leave the dol­lar’s rate of ap­pre­ci­a­tion at 0 per cent against a trade-weighted bas­ket of cur­ren­cies of the na­tion’s ma­jor trad­ing part­ners.</p>
    <p>There were also sig­nals in its hal­fyearly re­view that the stance would hold for some time, given that core in­fla­tion is ex­pected to stay low while the econ­omy re­cov­ers from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion will also mean that in­ter­est rates – al­ready at rock bot­tom – will largely stay un­changed.</p>
    <p>The Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) said: “The Sin­ga­pore econ­omy is ex­pected to see a re­cov­ery in 2021. How­ever, the un­der­ly­ing growth mo­men­tum will be weak, and the neg­a­tive out­put gap will only nar­row slowly in the year ahead.”</p>
    <p>It added that its ap­proach “will com­ple­ment fis­cal pol­icy ef­forts to mit­i­gate the eco­nomic im­pact of Covid-19 and en­sure price sta­bil­ity over the medium term”.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy Selena Ling said that MAS’ tone is “ba­si­cally sta­tus quo with a tinge of dovish­ness out into 2021”.</p>
    <p>A clearer pic­ture next year of global and do­mes­tic eco­nomic re­cov­ery prospects and in­fla­tion might call for a re­con­sid­er­a­tion of its pol­icy stance, Ms Ling said.</p>
    <p>She added: “With MAS in wai­t­and-see mode, we ex­pect short­term Sin­ga­pore in­ter­est rates to also tread wa­ter around cur­rent ranges.”</p>
    <p>Bar­clays Bank an­a­lysts Brian Tan, Ashish Agrawal and Yile Gu said that the MAS might tighten its for­eign ex­change pol­icy if the global econ­omy re­cov­ers faster than ex­pected, es­pe­cially if there is no­table progress on a Covid-19 vac­cine.</p>
    <p>“Con­versely, the bar for fur­ther eas­ing in pol­icy looks rel­a­tively high... un­less there is an­other col­lapse in global or do­mes­tic eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity,” they said.</p>
    <p>All 13 econ­o­mists in a Reuters poll fore­cast that the MAS would keep its pol­icy set­tings un­changed on hopes that the econ­omy will re­cover on fur­ther eas­ing of Covid-19 re­stric­tions and un­prece­dented Bud­get pack­ages amount­ing to nearly $100 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Flash data also re­leased yes­ter­day morn­ing showed that the econ­omy has moved past the trough of its worst re­ces­sion, with gross do­mes­tic prod­uct re­bound­ing by 7.9 per cent from the sec­ond quar­ter to the third on a sea­son­ally ad­justed ba­sis.</p>
    <p>It comes af­ter the 13.2 per cent quar­ter-on-quar­ter fall in the sec­ond quar­ter that in­cluded the April 7 to June 1 cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The MAS also up­graded its 2020 fore­cast range for both core and over­all in­fla­tion to mi­nus 0.5 per cent to 0 per cent. Its pre­vi­ous 2020 fore­casts for both were mi­nus 1 per cent to 0 per cent.</p>
    <p>Core in­fla­tion – a key con­sid­er­a­tion for mone­tary pol­icy, which aims for price sta­bil­ity con­ducive to sus­tained eco­nomic growth – stayed neg­a­tive for the sev­enth con­sec­u­tive month in Au­gust, but eased to mi­nus 0.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>The MAS tips core in­fla­tion to come in next year at 0 per cent to 1 per cent, while over­all in­fla­tion is ex­pected to be be­tween mi­nus 0.5 per cent to 0.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>It man­ages the Sing­dol­lar within an un­spec­i­fied band against a bas­ket of cur­ren­cies of key trad­ing part­ners. It can ad­just this band based on how it sees risks to the coun­try’s growth and in­fla­tion.</p>
    <p>It took the un­prece­dented step in its April re­view to both lower the mid­point of the cur­rency band and re­duce the slope to zero.</p>
    <p>That meant it al­lowed for a weaker ex­change rate to head off de­fla­tion and sup­port Sin­ga­pore’s ex­port-re­liant econ­omy as the na­tion braced it­self for a deep re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Since that de­ci­sion, the Sin­ga­pore dol­lar has traded stronger in line with global trad­ing part­ners amid signs of eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore econ­omy is ex­pected to see a re­cov­ery in 2021. How­ever, the un­der­ly­ing growth mo­men­tum will be weak, and the neg­a­tive out­put gap will only nar­row slowly in the year ahead.</p>
