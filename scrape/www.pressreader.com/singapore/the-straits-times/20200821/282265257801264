    <p>ORLANDO (Florida) • Un­less the Bos­ton Celtics make the Eastern Con­fer­ence Fi­nals, Gor­don Hay­ward will play no fur­ther part in the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion play-offs.</p>
    <p>Even that pro­jec­tion seems op­ti­mistic after Danny Ainge, their pres­i­dent of bas­ket­ball op­er­a­tions, re­vealed on Wed­nes­day that the All-Star for­ward, who av­er­aged 17.5 points per game in the reg­u­lar sea­son, would miss about a month, call­ing his an­kle in­jury “dev­as­tat­ing”.</p>
    <p>But in Jayson Ta­tum, Bos­ton have a “su­per­star” that is ca­pa­ble of in­spir­ing the third seed in the East, even when shorn of one of their lead­ing play­ers.</p>
    <p>Team­mate Kemba Walker hailed him as one of the lu­mi­nar­ies of the NBA after the Celtics took a com­mand­ing 2-0 lead in Game 2 of their play-off se­ries with the Philadel­phia 76ers, beat­ing their old­est ri­vals 128-101 at Dis­ney World on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>It has been a break­through year for Ta­tum, who is in his third sea­son with Bos­ton, with his av­er­age of 23.4 points per game an eight­point im­prove­ment from his pre­vi­ous cam­paign.</p>
    <p>His growth as a player led to Al­lS­tar honours in Fe­bru­ary for the first time and against the Six­ers, just like in Game 1, he showed why he is con­sid­ered one of the big­gest tal­ents in the game.</p>
    <p>He paced his team with 33 points, but the 22-year-old also be­came the youngest ever to hit eight three-point­ers in the play-offs. He also added a team-high five as­sists.</p>
    <p>His haul helped Bos­ton equal their team’s record for most num­ber of three-point­ers scored in the post-sea­son, with 57 points from be­yond the arc to 15 for the Six­ers.</p>
    <p>On Ta­tum, Walker, who added 22 points, told MassLive.com: “We ex­pect it now for sure. He’s been show­ing it night in, night out. He just makes the right reads, man. He’s a spe­cial tal­ent.”</p>
    <p>Celtics re­serve cen­tre Enes Kan­ter, who had 10 points, agreed, say­ing: “Jayson is un­be­liev­able. I have no words for him. This guy is just bring­ing so much, not just on the court, but bring­ing so much pure lead­er­ship. Ev­ery time he’s out there, he’s hav­ing fun, he’s mak­ing him­self bet­ter and he’s mak­ing ev­ery­body else bet­ter around him. That’s what’s mak­ing him spe­cial.”</p>
    <p>Joel Em­biid led all scor­ers with 34 points for the 76ers, who again ap­peared ham­strung by the ab­sence of star guard Ben Sim­mons – he had sea­son-end­ing knee surgery last week – and the All-Star cen­tre did not mince his words later, claim­ing “some­thing’s got to change” if his team do not want to go home early.</p>
