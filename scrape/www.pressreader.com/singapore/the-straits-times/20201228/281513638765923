    <p>ES­TI­MATED PRICE OF AN ELEC­TRIC SCOOTER BY SCORPIO ELEC­TRIC</p>
    <p>Why would a busi­ness­man who made his for­tune sell­ing high-end sports cars em­bark on a mo­tor­cy­cle-mak­ing ven­ture?</p>
    <p>“I saw the op­por­tu­nity to build my own brand,” said Mr Melvin Goh, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Scorpio Elec­tric, which ex­pects to roll out Sin­ga­pore’s first elec­tric scooter in two years’ time.</p>
    <p>“This is a once-in-a-life­time chance to cre­ate some­thing new.”</p>
    <p>At an ex­clu­sive pre­view on Dec 15, Mr Goh un­veiled a work­ing pro­to­type of the lithium-ion bat­tery­pow­ered two-wheeler, Scorpio X.</p>
    <p>A 50,000 sq ft fa­cil­ity in Te­ban Gar­dens Cres­cent in Jurong will house an assem­bly line that will start op­er­a­tions in the se­cond half of 2022. Its ca­pac­ity will be 8,000 scoot­ers a year, but pro­duc­tion will be 2,000 for the first year.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh is best known for high­oc­tane mo­tor fran­chises, start­ing with Lo­tus in 1998, Lam­borgh­ini in 2000 and Alfa Romeo in 2004.</p>
    <p>He has since re­lin­quished the Lo­tus deal­er­ship, but ac­quired a re­gional distributo­rship for Tour­ing Su­per­leg­gera in 2012.</p>
    <p>Th­ese fran­chises are parked un­der listed EuroS­ports Global.</p>
    <p>Be­fore land­ing th­ese fran­chises, Mr Goh sold used sports cars at Gay Hin, a com­pany that his father started in the 1950s.</p>
    <p>At 64, when most of his con­tem­po­raries are re­tir­ing or slow­ing down, Mr Goh is just get­ting started on Scorpio. “All my friends say I’m crazy. But I told my­self, ‘Don’t miss this op­por­tu­nity.’”</p>
    <p>He con­fessed that the new ven­ture is “a lot more work than I an­tic­i­pated” and “far riskier than all my pre­vi­ous busi­nesses”. “But I think the po­ten­tial re­wards out­weigh the risk,” he said, adding that his life­long ex­pe­ri­ence with mar­ket­ing high-end cars would come in use­ful in the new ven­ture. “All my life, I’ve worked with known brands. And I know about brand­ing.”</p>
    <p>If all goes as planned, Scorpio would have pre-tax profit mar­gins of be­tween 10 per cent and 15 per cent. “Within the first year, we would be cash-flow pos­i­tive.”</p>
    <p>His jour­ney started about two years ago, when it be­came clear that elec­tric ve­hi­cles were here to stay. “If it were an in­ter­nal com­bus­tion-en­gined bike, we would have no chance be­cause we would not be able to com­pete with all the es­tab­lished brands,” Mr Goh said.</p>
    <p>“But with elec­tric, ev­ery­body is still just start­ing out.”</p>
    <p>The X is a pre­mium scooter with an es­ti­mated price of US$8,000 (S$10,630) be­fore taxes. In Sin­ga­pore, it would be be­tween $25,000 and $30,000, af­ter taxes and the cer­tifi­cate of en­ti­tle­ment.</p>
    <p>This would be fol­lowed by a big mo­tor­cy­cle and, later, a bud­get scooter half the price of the X.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh said the move to start with a pre­mium prod­uct is sim­i­lar to Amer­i­can elec­tric car­maker Tesla’s strat­egy.</p>
    <p>He is con­vinced that en­ter­ing the fray in the less-crowded pre­mium seg­ment would al­low Scorpio to have an ef­fec­tive foothold be­fore it tar­gets the mass mar­ket, which is dom­i­nated by the Ja­panese.</p>
    <p>The X will have a 5kW mo­tor pow­ered by a 5kWh bat­tery.</p>
    <p>It is ex­pected to hit 60kmh in four sec­onds, at­tain a top speed of 105kmh and have a range of 200km. Via a house­hold socket, it will take four hours to recharge.</p>
    <p>The two-wheeler will fall un­der the 2B rid­ing li­cence, which means be­gin­ners will be able to ride it.</p>
    <p>Parts for its body and chas­sis will be fab­ri­cated in Asean, its driv­e­train will be Ja­panese and its bat­tery ei­ther from a Korean or Ger­man sup­plier.</p>
    <p>The bike’s elec­tronic ar­chi­tec­ture – which in­te­grates the driv­e­train with an on­board com­puter – will be Scorpio’s own. The bike will have to be con­nected to the In­ter­net, and its per­for­mance can be en­hanced – over the air – based on us­age data. Rid­ers will be able to start the bike with their smart­phone.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh likened it to the iPhone, which is made in China, “but the brain be­longs to Ap­ple”.</p>
    <p>He said Scorpio has raised US$8.5 mil­lion in funds (ex­clud­ing $2 mil­lion seed fund­ing from EuroS­ports Global), and needs to raise an­other $27 mil­lion or so to get the X to mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore has been very sup­port­ive,” he said, adding that it helped the start-up source for skilled en­gi­neers, with sub­sidises for their salaries, and ob­tain grants for the assem­bly fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>His team, which he said took two years to build, in­cludes ex­perts from Aus­trian mo­tor­cy­cle maker KTM, the Agency for Science, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search and the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity.</p>
