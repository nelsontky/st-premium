    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US busi­nesses are not leav­ing the Chi­nese mar­ket de­spite “an un­prece­dented down­turn” in US-China re­la­tions dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to an an­nual mem­ber sur­vey by the US-China Busi­ness Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>“Both our data as well as con­ver­sa­tions with mem­ber com­pa­nies in­di­cate that Amer­i­can com­pa­nies re­main com­mit­ted to the China mar­ket over the long term,” said the coun­cil, which re­leased the sur­vey on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The US-China Busi­ness Coun­cil is a trade group rep­re­sent­ing more than 200 US com­pa­nies that do busi­ness with China.</p>
    <p>Up to 83 per cent of the com­pa­nies counted China as ei­ther the top or among the top five pri­or­i­ties for their com­pany’s global strat­egy, ac­cord­ing to the sur­vey, which was con­ducted in late May and June among more than 100 com­pa­nies that are mem­bers of the USChina Busi­ness Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>Pro­jec­tions about the five-year busi­ness out­look in China are sim­i­larly san­guine, with nearly 70 per cent say­ing they are op­ti­mistic about the com­mer­cial prospects of the mar­ket, ac­cord­ing to the poll.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, 91 per cent of the com­pa­nies in­di­cate that their China op­er­a­tions are prof­itable, al­beit at a lower mar­gin than in years past, the sur­vey showed, not­ing that the pri­mary re­straint on prof­itabil­ity is the coro­n­avirus out­break and its im­pact on the Chi­nese econ­omy.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult of this long-term con­fi­dence in the Chi­nese mar­ket, 87 per cent of com­pa­nies re­ported no plans to move pro­duc­tion out of the coun­try, the sur­vey noted, adding that some com­pa­nies are seek­ing po­ten­tial new in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>One quar­ter of the US-China Busi­ness Coun­cil mem­ber com­pa­nies, how­ever, had re­duced or stopped planned in­vest­ment in China in the last year, the sur­vey showed.</p>
    <p>The top rea­sons were in­creased costs, un­cer­tain­ties from US-China trade ten­sions and un­cer­tainty stem­ming from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The an­nual sur­vey also noted that the US-China re­la­tion­ship poses the top chal­lenge for Amer­i­can com­pa­nies in China for the third con­sec­u­tive year, as 86 per cent of US-China Busi­ness Coun­cil mem­bers re­port that bi­lat­eral trade ten­sions have had an im­pact on their busi­ness with China.</p>
    <p>“US-China trade and in­vest­ment sup­ports about 2.6 mil­lion Amer­i­can jobs,” said coun­cil pres­i­dent Craig Allen, adding: “We need to sus­tain and grow those jobs in fu­ture years, while find­ing ways to re­duce con­flict in other ar­eas of the re­la­tion­ship.”</p>
    <p>While busi­ness un­cer­tainty re­mains high across the board, the China-US phase one eco­nomic and trade agree­ment pro­vided “a mod­icum of con­fi­dence” in the China in­vest­ment en­vi­ron­ment by “freez­ing ad­di­tional tar­iff in­creases and sta­bil­is­ing the over­all com­mer­cial re­la­tion­ship”, the sur­vey said.</p>
    <p>Some 88 per cent of re­spon­dents have a pos­i­tive or some­what pos­i­tive view of the agree­ment, the sur­vey showed.</p>
    <p>“Com­pa­nies are now see­ing the fruits of the agree­ment, par­tic­u­larly the mar­ket open­ings,” said Mr Allen.</p>
    <p>“Phase one must be a suc­cess if we are to deepen trade ne­go­ti­a­tions and work to­wards a phase two. As our sur­vey shows us, there is more work to be done.”</p>
