    <p>•</p>
    <p>GENEVA The World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s (WTO) bid to select a new leader was plunged into un­cer­tainty on Wed­nes­day af­ter the United States re­jected the Nige­rian woman pro­posed as the global trade watch­dog’s next direc­torgen­eral.</p>
    <p>Six days be­fore the US elec­tion in which trade is a hot topic, Wash­ing­ton struck an­other blow at the WTO, which US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has de­scribed as “hor­ri­ble” and bi­ased to­wards China.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has al­ready paral­ysed the WTO’s role as global ar­biter on trade by block­ing ap­point­ments to its ap­peals panel. Now, it threat­ens to ren­der it lead­er­less for weeks or months to come.</p>
    <p>The WTO has called a meet­ing for Nov 9, less than a week af­ter the elec­tion, by which time it hopes to have se­cured full back­ing for Nige­ria’s Ms Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala.</p>
    <p>But the de­ci­sion still needs to be ap­proved by con­sen­sus, mean­ing any of the 164 WTO mem­bers could block her ap­point­ment.</p>
    <p>Af­ter weeks of con­sul­ta­tions, three WTO am­bas­sadors, charged with find­ing a suc­ces­sor to Brazil­ian Roberto Azevedo, an­nounced on Wed­nes­day that the for­mer Nige­rian fi­nance min­is­ter should be the next chief as she had se­cured cross-re­gional back­ing.</p>
    <p>“All of the del­e­ga­tions that ex­pressed their views to­day ex­pressed very strong sup­port... Ex­cept for one,” WTO spokesman Keith Rock­well said, spec­i­fy­ing that the one was the US.</p>
    <p>The US Trade Rep­re­sen­ta­tive’s of­fice later re­leased a state­ment of­fi­cially back­ing the only other re­main­ing can­di­date, South Korean Trade Min­is­ter Yoo Myung-hee, prais­ing her as a suc­cess­ful trade ne­go­tia­tor with the skills needed to lead the trade body at a “very dif­fi­cult time”.</p>
    <p>“It must be led by some­one with real, hands-on ex­pe­ri­ence in the field,” it said in a dig at the Nige­rian can­di­date who crit­ics say lacks tech­ni­cal knowl­edge of mul­ti­lat­eral trade talks.</p>
    <p>Mr Wil­liam Rein­sch, a for­mer se­nior Com­merce Depart­ment of­fi­cial now with the Cen­tre for Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies, said the US move was likely to worsen trade ten­sions al­ready run­ning high within the WTO.</p>
    <p>“It’s very Trumpian. They’re ba­si­cally say­ing, ‘We want to get our way and we’re will­ing to throw sand in the gears if we don’t get it,’” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Okonjo-Iweala’s spokesman said she was “im­mensely hum­bled” by the back­ing of the WTO’s se­lec­tion com­mit­tee and hoped for a swift con­clu­sion to the process.</p>
    <p>Mr Rock­well said there was likely to be “fren­zied ac­tiv­ity” be­fore the Nov 9 meet­ing to se­cure the re­quired con­sen­sus.</p>
    <p>Many mem­bers, in­clud­ing China and the US, had de­clined to name their pref­er­ence pub­licly be­fore Wed­nes­day, though some African, Caribbean and other states had voiced sup­port for Ms Okon­joIweala dur­ing the four-month se­lec­tion process. The Euro­pean Union en­dorsed her on Oct 26.</p>
    <p>The lead­er­ship void was cre­ated af­ter the out­go­ing WTO chief, Mr Azevedo, stepped down a year early in Au­gust. The WTO is cur­rently be­ing steered by four deputies.</p>
    <p>Ms Okonjo-Iweala, 66, a for­mer fi­nance min­is­ter and World Bank man­ag­ing di­rec­tor, would face con­sid­er­able chal­lenges, with ri­val economies bick­er­ing amid ris­ing ten­sions, pro­tec­tion­ism and a coro­n­avirus-in­duced trade plunge.</p>
