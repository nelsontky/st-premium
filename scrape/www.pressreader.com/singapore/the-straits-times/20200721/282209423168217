    <p>LON­DON • With de­mand for gold as a haven dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, con­cerns about sourc­ing the pre­cious metal re­spon­si­bly have again been thrust into the spot­light.</p>
    <p>A re­port from Global Wit­ness al­leg­ing that one of the world’s big­gest gold re­fin­ers has worked with a sup­plier that was at risk of hav­ing bought con­flict metal orig­i­nat­ing in Su­dan, is the lat­est in a se­ries of calls from ad­vo­cacy groups urg­ing the Lon­don Bul­lion Mar­ket As­so­ci­a­tion (LBMA) to scru­ti­nise pro­duc­ers more closely.</p>
    <p>Gold, which is trad­ing near an eight-year high, is one of four con­flict min­er­als that United States­listed com­pa­nies, from Tif­fany & Co to Ap­ple, must trace and re­port on to the Se­cu­ri­ties and Ex­change Com­mis­sion. The same group of min­er­als will be cov­ered by bind­ing Euro­pean Union due dili­gence rules from next year.</p>
    <p>Sup­pli­ers are com­ing un­der pres­sure to show that they have pro­cesses and poli­cies in place to make sure the metal has not fi­nanced con­flict or been linked to cor­rup­tion or hu­man rights abuses.</p>
    <p>In its re­port last Thurs­day, Global Wit­ness al­leged that Swiss re­finer Val­cambi bought large amounts of gold from Dubai-based Kaloti Pre­cious Met­als, which in turn was at risk of hav­ing pur­chased Su­danese con­flict gold.</p>
    <p>It said there are gaps i n the LBMA’s re­spon­si­ble sourc­ing stan­dards that do not gen­er­ally re­quire re­fin­ers to dis­close their sup­pli­ers.</p>
    <p>Val­cambi de­clined to im­me­di­ately com­ment on the Global Wit­ness re­port. Kaloti said the al­le­ga­tions were not true.</p>
    <p>“Kaloti is in­de­pen­dently au­dited each year against the rel­e­vant stan­dards and at no time has any con­flict ma­te­rial, from any ju­ris­dic­tion, in­clud­ing Su­dan, been iden­ti­fied in any of its sup­ply chains,” it said.</p>
    <p>“Fur­ther­more, Kaloti has never sent any gold ma­te­rial sourced from Su­dan to any Swiss re­fin­ery what­so­ever.”</p>
    <p>Val­cambi has also de­nied Global Wit­ness’ find­ings and said it con­ducts en­hanced due dili­gence, the ad­vo­cacy group said.</p>
    <p>Bern-based non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion Swis­said, in a sep­a­rate re­port pub­lished last Thurs­day, also crit­i­cised the LBMA’s cur­rent stan­dards, urg­ing it to be “much more rig­or­ous” on scru­ti­n­is­ing the sup­plies of its mem­ber re­finer­ies.</p>
    <p>The LBMA said last Fri­day that its re­spon­si­ble sourc­ing pro­gramme “is de­signed to be a holis­tic process that en­gages all stake­hold­ers” and that the as­so­ci­a­tion can­not tackle the is­sue alone. It said it “also recog­nises that more needs to be done”.</p>
    <p>The as­so­ci­a­tion is work­ing with a third-party ser­vice provider to have new rec­om­men­da­tions this year on how to fur­ther im­prove trans­parency, dis­clo­sure and au­dit pro­cesses, said Ms Sakhila Mirza, an ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor and gen­eral coun­sel.</p>
    <p>The LBMA will also pub­lish its an­nual re­port with up­dates on the pro­gramme and fu­ture de­vel­op­ments in the com­ing weeks, she added.</p>
    <p>Val­cambi last month said it pledged to adopt a new sys­tem to in­crease trans­parency in its process for sourc­ing pre­cious met­als. Based on blockchain tech­nol­ogy, the sys­tem will re­quire the re­finer’s po­ten­tial gold sup­pli­ers to up­load all due dili­gence in­for­ma­tion, i nclud­ing data and doc­u­ments, into a data­base, which will then be ac­ces­si­ble to all ap­pro­pri­ate au­dit­ing par­ties.</p>
    <p>It is not the only re­finer com­ing un­der re­cent scru­tiny.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, ac­tivist group Raid asked the LBMA to sus­pend In­dia-based re­finer MMTC-PAMP, part of an­other Swiss ma­jor, MKS PAMP Group, over gold from a mine in Tan­za­nia where there have been al­le­ga­tions of hu­man rights abuses. The re­finer de­nied all the com­plaints and al­le­ga­tions by Raid.</p>
    <p>The LBMA also said last month that it is re­view­ing re­ported sourc­ing con­cerns at the Perth Mint over gold orig­i­nat­ing from Pa­pua New Guinea.</p>
