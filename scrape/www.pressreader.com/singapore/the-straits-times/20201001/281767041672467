    <p>The West­gate shop­ping mall in Jurong, 313@som­er­set and Ang Mo Kio Hub are among new lo­ca­tions vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were in­fec­tious, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Other places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients in­clude Grain Al­ley in Or­chard Cen­tral, a Star­bucks out­let in Sun Plaza, and The Shoppes at Ma­rina Bay Sands, MOH said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The vis­its took place be­tween Sept 23 and 29. MOH pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes and the time at which they vis­ited, so that peo­ple who were there at the same time can mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of the visit.</p>
    <p>Close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied, and there is no need to avoid th­ese places as they would have been cleaned if nec­es­sary, MOH said.</p>
    <p>There were 23 new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of re­ported cases to 57,765. They in­cluded three com­mu­nity cases, all of whom are work per­mit hold­ers, MOH said.</p>
    <p>There were also four im­ported cases, com­pris­ing one Sin­ga­porean, one per­ma­nent res­i­dent and two work per­mit hold­ers.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean re­turned from In­dia on Sept 12, while the per­ma­nent res­i­dent re­turned from In­done­sia last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Both work per­mit hold­ers re­turned from the Philip­pines on Sept 18.</p>
    <p>All the im­ported cases were placed on stay-home no­tices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 16 of the 23 new coro­n­avirus pa­tients yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Of th­ese, 10 had been iden­ti­fied ear­lier as con­tacts of pre­vi­ous cases, and had al­ready been quar­an­tined to pre­vent fur­ther trans­mis­sion. They were tested dur­ing their quar­an­tine pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing six cases were de­tected through sur­veil­lance test­ing.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one case a day in the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one case a day over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 22 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,473 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 41 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 209 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>There have been 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions in Sin­ga­pore, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
