    <p>This sec­ond streamed con­cert un­der the direc­tion of the Sin­ga­pore Sym­phony Orches­tra’s (SSO) chief con­duc­tor Hans Graf was a clever jux­ta­po­si­tion of clas­si­cal and neo­clas­si­cal styles, ex­em­pli­fied by the mu­sic of Mozart and Stravin­sky.</p>
    <p>The Ada­gio and Fugue by Mozart is some­what out of the or­di­nary for the com­poser.</p>
    <p>Open­ing with a dark, men­ac­ing slow sec­tion, it has a strong, rhyth­mic fugue de­void of the lyri­cism that lis­ten­ers ex­pect from Mozart.</p>
    <p>Graf di­rected the 17-player string en­sem­ble in a pow­er­ful per­for­mance, lib­er­ally over-dot­ting the Ada­gio theme for ex­tra punch. The Fugue that fol­lowed was taut and suit­ably strong.</p>
    <p>Stravin­sky was one of count­less com­posers who greatly ad­mired Mozart. Graf picked Apollo, one of sev­eral bal­let scores he was com­mis­sioned to write for Bal­let Russes.</p>
    <p>The bal­let cen­tres on Apollo, leader of the muses, who is vis­ited by the muses of dance and song, mime and po­etry. Stravin­sky drew from baroque, ro­coco and clas­si­cal in­flu­ences in this work, but the mu­sic is uniquely his.</p>
    <p>Very dif­fer­ent play­ing emerged from the SSO strings, with ex­cel­lent so­los from the four sec­tion lead­ers and a brief, witty solo from Karen Yeo on bass. At times, the play­ing tended to the ro­man­tic, but this piece was a re­fresh­ing foil to the in­ten­sity of the Ada­gio and Fugue.</p>
    <p>An­other Stravin­sky-Mozart pair­ing made up the virtual sec­ond half of the con­cert.</p>
    <p>The Octet For Winds by Stravin­sky is for an un­usual en­sem­ble of flute, clar­inet, two bas­soons, two trum­pets, tenor and bass trom­bones. The com­poser has writ­ten about the use of “clas­si­cal” forms in its three move­ments – sonata, theme and vari­a­tions and fugue – and the Octet is re­garded as one of his pi­o­neer­ing com­po­si­tions in neo-clas­si­cal style.</p>
    <p>Graf joined the winds un-masked in this and the fol­low­ing piece.</p>
    <p>See­ing so much more of a con­duc­tor’s ex­pres­sions may have been a fac­tor, but what­ever the case, the SSO winds were fab­u­lous – play­ing with su­perb sound, en­sem­ble and style. There was not a weak link among the eight.</p>
    <p>A sense of en­joy­ment could be felt in the sec­ond move­ment, and Li Xin (clar­inet) and Liu Chang (bas­soon) were sparkling in the fi­nal move­ment fugue.</p>
    <p>As sud­denly as the sound opened up in the Octet, it dark­ened in the clos­ing work, Mozart’s Ser­e­nade In E Flat, K.375 for winds.</p>
    <p>Writ­ten in five move­ments for two each of oboe, clar­inet, bas­soon and horn, it has two fast outer move­ments, two min­uets in be­tween and an ex­quis­ite slow move­ment in the mid­dle.</p>
    <p>Graf is a master of Mozart, but the con­trast in sound and ar­tic­u­la­tion be­tween neo- and “ur-” (orig­i­nal) clas­si­cal seemed too stark. For­tu­nately, the Ser­e­nade picked up with each move­ment, and there was a rous­ing fi­nale to the piece.</p>
    <p>The pro­gram­ming for this con­cert was in­spired.</p>
    <p>Within the con­straints of player num­bers and in­stru­men­ta­tion per­mit­ted, Graf has se­lected works that show how the past in­flu­ences the present and the fu­ture; and how mu­sic can be so dif­fer­ent, yet sim­i­lar.</p>
    <p>The SSO is find­ing its feet in this new or­der of recorded medium, and the Stravin­sky Octet was a per­for­mance to re­mem­ber.</p>
