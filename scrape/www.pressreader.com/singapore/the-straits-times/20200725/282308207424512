    <p>• All top-level ten­nis and the Di­a­mond League ath­let­ics were wiped off China’s 2020 sport­ing cal­en­dar yes­ter­day, fol­low­ing a gov­ern­ment edict aimed at con­trol­ling the coro­n­avirus which could also spell doom for F1’s Chi­nese Grand Prix and the coun­try’s big­gest golf tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>The WTA Fi­nals in Shen­zhen and the Shanghai Masters were prime among the ten­nis tour­na­ments to fall as the sport, strug­gling to restart in the face of the pan­demic, suf­fered an­other ma­jor blow.</p>
    <p>Shanghai’s Di­a­mond League ath­let­ics and Masters snooker have also gone, pro­mot­ers said, just over two weeks af­ter China’s Gen­eral Ad­min­is­tra­tion of Sport said most in­ter­na­tional events this year would be called off.</p>
    <p>The can­cel­la­tions come de­spite the re­turn of do­mes­tic sports in China, with foot­ball’s Chi­nese Su­per League start­ing to­day and fans al­lowed to at­tend China Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion games this week­end.</p>
    <p>Women’s Ten­nis As­so­ci­a­tion chief Steve Si­mon said he was “ex­tremely dis­ap­pointed” that the women’s ten­nis tour, which has bet heav­ily on the China mar­ket, has had to scrap seven tour­na­ments.</p>
    <p>“We do, how­ever, re­spect the de­ci­sion that has been made and are ea­ger to re­turn to China as soon as pos­si­ble next sea­son,” he added.</p>
    <p>Among the can­celled WTA tour­na­ments is Oc­to­ber’s Wuhan Open, which was to be hugely sym­bolic as the city was at the cen­tre of the Covid-19 out­break last year.</p>
    <p>The men’s As­so­ci­a­tion of Ten­nis Pro­fes­sion­als (ATP) said it was also can­celling its 2020 China swing, in­clud­ing the pres­ti­gious Shanghai Masters and China Open – a men’s and women’s event – in Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view this month, Si­mon spoke about the po­ten­tial ef­fects of los­ing the China events, es­pe­cially the WTA Fi­nals, which pro­vided a record US$14 mil­lion (S$19.4 mil­lion) in prize money in its first year in Shen­zhen last year.</p>
    <p>The WTA de­pends on the Fi­nals for a ma­jor chunk of its an­nual rev­enue. It has a 10-year deal with Shen­zhen, and the city is build­ing a 12,000-seat sta­dium to host the Fi­nals. Si­mon has said Shen­zhen’s to­tal in­vest­ment in ten­nis in­fra­struc­ture and the WTA Tour would likely amount to more than US$1 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>“We at the WTA, along with all other busi­nesses in the world, are be­ing chal­lenged fi­nan­cially through these times,” he said.</p>
    <p>“If we don’t have the Fi­nals, the hole that we have will cer­tainly be big­ger and deeper.”</p>
    <p>Los­ing the WTA Fi­nals this year also could cost the WTA its 2020 rights fee, which Si­mon has said is sig­nif­i­cantly more than the US$14 mil­lion it re­ceived an­nu­ally from the pre­vi­ous hosts Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>This week, the ATP can­celled the Citi Open, in Wash­ing­ton, that would have been the restart of the men’s ten­nis sea­son next month.</p>
    <p>The US$10.25 mil­lion WGCHSBC Cham­pi­ons golf, slated to start on Oct 31 in Shanghai, is an­other event that looks in peril.</p>
    <p>Juss Sports, a ma­jor Shanghai pro­moter which is also re­spon­si­ble for stag­ing F1 in the city, made no men­tion of the grand prix – orig­i­nally sched­uled for April – but that too now looks un­likely.</p>
    <p>The sport yes­ter­day aban­doned hope of hold­ing the Cana­dian (orig­i­nally June 14), US (Oct 25), Mex­i­can (Nov 1) and the Brazil­ian (Nov 15) grands prix be­cause of the coro­n­avirus sit­u­a­tion in the Amer­i­cas, ac­cord­ing to the BBC.</p>
    <p>In­stead, three fur­ther races in Europe are to be added to the cal­en­dar, namely a re­turn for Ger­many’s Nur­bur­gring (Oct 11) and Imola (Nov 1) in Italy, and an F1 de­but for Por­tu­gal’s Por­ti­mao track on Oct 25.</p>
