    </section>

    <p>When he could not have a grad­u­a­tion cer­e­mony last July be­cause of Covid-19, it was a downer for pho­tog­ra­pher Hidhir Badaruddin.</p>
    <p>But he still ended the year on a high note – a first prize grant of US$10,000 (S$13,190) from Getty Im­ages for what be­gan as his fi­na­lyear pro­ject.</p>
    <p>The Lon­don Col­lege of Fash­ion grad­u­ate was awarded for his photo se­ries Younglawa, which ex­plores his vi­sion of a new gen­er­a­tion of Asian mas­culin­ity. It makes him the first Sin­ga­porean to re­ceive Getty Im­ages’ Cre­ative Bur­sary grant, beat­ing 250 ap­pli­cants world­wide.</p>
    <p>The 25-year-old, who is based in Lon­don and ma­jored in cre­ative direc­tion, tells The Straits Times over a video call that it was a sur­real win.</p>
    <p>“It was all so new to me, even be­ing recog­nised as a pho­tog­ra­pher. Peo­ple don’t al­ways take you se­ri­ously when you’re a cer­tain age</p>
    <p>– you come on set and they ask if you’re the in­tern or as­sis­tant,” he says.</p>
    <p>“For an emerg­ing cre­ative who grad­u­ated amid the pan­demic, win­ning the grant means so much be­cause it shows there is sup­port for my work. And as a brown Asian, it means even more.”</p>
    <p>Younglawa – the name is a play on the Malay phrase “yang lawa”, which refers to a beau­ti­ful per­son – fea­tures four young men pho­tographed i n fa­mil­iar set­tings i n Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Want­ing his im­ages to re­flect a raw in­ti­macy, Mr Hidhir chose sets and places with “lit­tle hints that re­mind you of the ev­ery­day” – a Pepsi vend­ing ma­chine here, sub­tle hints of the Sin­ga­pore sky­line there.</p>
    <p>He got to work shoot­ing i n Jan­uary last year, but his plans to re­turn in March to con­tinue the se­ries were dis­rupted by the coron­avirus.</p>
    <p>The dreamy se­ries por­trays of­ten-un­der­rep­re­sented brown Asians, says Mr Hidhir, as well as</p>
    <p>“the dif­fer­ent faces of mas­culin­ity within the Asian com­mu­nity”.</p>
    <p>It is a topic close to his heart, stem­ming from his lived ex­pe­ri­ence and con­stantly be­ing ques­tioned “what kind of Asian” he was – both in Lon­don and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Of Malay-In­dian her­itage, the chatty young man says he felt the ef­fects of colourism even within his own com­mu­nity. He re­calls re­minders from el­ders to “not play out in the sun for too long or your skin will turn dark”, as if hav­ing darker skin was a neg­a­tive thing.</p>
    <p>He felt it even more strongly in</p>
    <p>Pho­tog­ra­pher Hidhir Badaruddin (above) was awarded a first prize grant of US$10,000 (S$13,190) from Getty Im­ages for his photo se­ries Younglawa (left), which ex­plores his vi­sion for a new gen­er­a­tion of Asian mas­culin­ity.</p>
    <p>Lon­don, where he headed to in 2017 af­ter grad­u­at­ing in de­sign and com­mu­ni­ca­tions from Lasalle Col­lege of the Arts and serv­ing na­tional ser­vice.</p>
    <p>“I re­alised a lot of Western coun­tries as­so­ciate Asian iden­tity with East Asia, par­tic­u­larly the Kore­ans and Ja­panese. I think peo­ple for­get there is a wide spec­trum to Asian iden­tity. There is great di­ver­sity, but you wouldn’t know that look­ing at main­stream me­dia.”</p>
    <p>Within the fash­ion in­dus­try, he also found that rep­re­sen­ta­tion of Asian iden­tity was “still mostly one look”.</p>
    <p>Case in point: the late Chi­nese pho­tog­ra­pher Ren Hang – “who, for the long­est time, was the Western world’s go-to for Asian iden­tity when it comes to pho­tog­ra­phy” and whose work Mr Hidhir found skewed to­wards East Asians.</p>
    <p>“Not see­ing peo­ple that looked like me in cam­paigns was another cat­a­lyst for Younglawa. It made me think of how brown Asians such as South Asians (In­di­ans, Pak­ista­nis) and South-east Asians (Malays, Filipinos) are of­ten over­looked.”</p>
    <p>Living in Lon­don so­lid­i­fied his de­sire to chal­lenge Euro­cen­tric beauty stan­dards and his pho­tog­ra­phy be­came in­creas­ingly shaped by his re­la­tion­ship with his eth­nic iden­tity and sex­u­al­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Hidhir also found him­self ex­cluded in the West’s per­cep­tion of Asian mas­culin­ity.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple of­ten for­get that j ust be­cause the me­dia al­ways shows the United King­dom in a Euro­cen­tric light, there is still so much di­ver­sity in the ev­ery­day.”</p>
    <p>So he sought to cre­ate a photo se­ries that would be in­clu­sive to men of dif­fer­ent shapes, skin tones, sex­ual ori­en­ta­tion and gen­der ex­pres­sions.</p>
    <p>He has al­ways been a pho­tog­ra­phy en­thu­si­ast, but ex­plored it more se­ri­ously only in Lon­don.</p>
    <p>While Younglawa started as his fi­nal-year pro­ject, it has taken on a life of its own. It was first fea­tured in July last year in Bri­tish style magazine Dazed, which opened doors to more pub­li­ca­tions, such as arts and cul­ture ti­tle Vice Magazine, and drew global in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>“Many peo­ple from across the world reached out to say the se­ries res­onated with them; a few (ex­pressed in­ter­est to) be part of it as well.”</p>
    <p>He later came across the Getty Im­ages com­pe­ti­tion via Amer­i­can writer and cu­ra­tor Ant­waun Sar­gent’s Twit­ter page. He con­densed 100 pages of his fi­nal-year pro­ject into 10 and sub­mit­ted them.</p>
    <p>Along with the prize money, Mr Hidhir will re­ceive men­tor­ship from one of Getty Im­ages’ art di­rec­tors. He is also in­vited to li­cense his win­ning con­tent through Get­tyI­mages.com and re­ceive full roy­al­ties.</p>
    <p>The win, he says, was “quite per­sonal” for him.</p>
    <p>“I come from a very aca­dem­i­cally in­clined fam­ily – with cousins in medicine and ed­u­ca­tion – I was the black sheep when I told peo­ple I was go­ing to do fash­ion.”</p>
    <p>He plans to con­tinue shoot­ing the Younglawa se­ries in Lon­don once the city comes out of its lat­est lock­down.</p>
    <p>And when bor­ders re­open, he has dreams to turn it into a book or hold a photo ex­hi­bi­tion in Sin­ga­pore and Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Un­til then, he will re­main in Lon­don, hav­ing snagged a spon­sor visa from the Univer­sity of the Arts Lon­don to con­tinue his pho­tog­ra­phy work. He re­cently shot fash­ion col­lec­tive Art School for Dazed.</p>
    <p>“I re­mem­ber learn­ing about Art School in fresh­man year and now be­ing able to shoot for them is like com­ing full cir­cle,” he says.</p>
    <p>“I hope to be able to col­lab­o­rate on fu­ture projects for my skills and ca­pa­bil­ity, and not just be seen as a check­list or trend to a brand to have di­verse eth­nic­i­ties or sex­u­al­i­ties for a pro­ject.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing di­verse should not be a check­list item any­more; it should just be an or­ganic thing.”</p>
