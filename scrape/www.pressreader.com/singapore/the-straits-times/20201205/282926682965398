    <p>Mazda has left the best for last. The CX-30 Sky­Ac­tiv-X you see here may look like the car launched 18 months ago, but it is a dif­fer­ent and em­i­nently su­pe­rior car.</p>
    <p>Its Sky­Ac­tiv-X en­gine is de­signed to of­fer the best of diesel and petrol power plants, which means you get more ef­fi­ciency, torque and lin­ear­ity in re­sponse.</p>
    <p>It has an ex­tremely high com­pres­sion ra­tio of 15:1 (like a tur­bod­iesel). This is 20 per cent higher than the Sky­Ac­tiv-G en­gine (found in CX-30 cars sold in the last 18 months) and 50 per cent higher than most reg­u­lar petrol en­gines.</p>
    <p>With this high com­pres­sion ra­tio, the en­gine can op­er­ate with a leaner fuel mix­ture (more air in the blend), re­sult­ing in bet­ter econ­omy. In fact, Mazda says it runs on a 30:1 air-fuel ra­tio – twice as lean as con­ven­tional petrol units. To fa­cil­i­tate this, a su­per­charger is em­ployed to con­tin­u­ally force truck-loads of air into the en­gine.</p>
    <p>Us­ing the spark plug and high com­pres­sion, com­bus­tion is also more com­plete and evenly spread out in the cham­bers, re­sult­ing in bet­ter per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>The re­sult is a nor­mally as­pi­rated en­gine which feels like a light-pres­sure turbo, de­liv­er­ing a peak torque of 224Nm from 3,000rpm (213Nm from 4,000rpm i n the Sky­Ac­tiv-G). At the wheel, the</p>
    <p>dif­fer­ence is ob­vi­ous.</p>
    <p>The unit makes 180hp – 15hp more than the Sky­Ac­tiv-G. Ac­cel­er­a­tion from zero to 100kmh is achieved in 9.1 sec­onds (9.7) and top speed is 204kmh (196kmh).</p>
    <p>Mazda’s stated fuel con­sump­tion for the Sky­Ac­tiv-X is 5.8 litres/ 100km (6.6 litres for the G). For this test-drive, the X av­er­aged 7.7 litres/100km, ver­sus more than 10 litres by the G test-car. This is de­spite the X be­ing some 5.7 per</p>
    <p>cent heav­ier than the G.</p>
    <p>Clearly, this is proof of the pud­ding. But it must be noted that the Sky­Ac­tiv-X car also has a mild hy­brid sys­tem, which con­trib­utes to its ef­fi­ciency – if marginally.</p>
    <p>While the Sky­Ac­tiv-X car feels breezier – es­pe­cially at lower en­gine speeds – it is not dra­mat­i­cally quicker. What it of­fers, though, is a will­ing­ness to pull across the rev range, and a re­strained ex­u­ber­ance which</p>
    <p>comes with the higher en­gine speeds.</p>
    <p>In this re­spect, the car feels like the Lexus UX com­pact SUV, which metes out per­for­mance in the most re­fined man­ner you can ex­pect from a 2-litre, four-cylin­der en­gine.</p>
    <p>The test car is fresh out of the box and Mazda has not even de­ter­mined its sell­ing price. As such, it is not quite “run in” and dis­plays a stick­i­ness which is most ob­vi­ous when you lift off to let it coast. The car does not coast very well. So, when it is run in, its ef­fi­ciency and per­for­mance could well im­prove.</p>
    <p>The car’s dampers are also edgier, mak­ing the ride a touch less comfy than the G’s.</p>
    <p>As with the G-vari­ant, the car is su­perbly built and thought­fully de­signed. Its min­i­mal­is­tic ap­proach to cock­pit con­trols ex­tends to minute de­tails, such as the speed-limit in­di­ca­tor which is built into the dig­i­tal speedome­ter.</p>
    <p>A sim­ple red notch tells you in no un­cer­tain terms the limit of the road you are on. And for safety, ad­dress in­put on the nav­i­ga­tion can be done only when the car’s trans­mis­sion is in P, and the park­ing brake is en­gaged.</p>
    <p>The X car has more lux­u­ri­ous trim (ma­roon leather up­hol­stery which goes well with the white paint­work) and more equip­ment, in­clud­ing a 12-speaker Bose hi-fi sys­tem, and a 360-de­gree cam­era, which makes park­ing a cinch.</p>
    <p>The test car is also a Mazda 100th-an­niver­sary edi­tion, which comes with spe­cial wheel caps and floor mats.</p>
    <p>All that adds up to a heftier price. But if you con­sider the car’s higher scrap value (higher open-mar­ket value than the G), its fuel sav­ings and the two ex­tra years of war­ranty and free ser­vic­ing (five ver­sus three for the G), the $30,000 price pre­mium be­comes far smaller.</p>
