    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK A nasal spray that blocks the ab­sorp­tion of the SarsCoV-2 virus has com­pletely pro­tected fer­rets it was tested on, ac­cord­ing to a small study re­leased on Thurs­day by a team of sci­en­tists.</p>
    <p>The study, which was lim­ited to an­i­mals and has not yet been peer­re­viewed, was as­sessed by sev­eral health ex­perts at the re­quest of The New York Times.</p>
    <p>If the spray, which the sci­en­tists de­scribed as non-toxic and sta­ble, is proved to work in hu­mans, it could pro­vide a new way of fight­ing the pan­demic. A daily spritz up the nose would act like a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing some­thing new that works against the coro­n­avirus is ex­cit­ing,” said Dr Ar­turo Casade­vall, chair­man of im­munol­ogy at the Johns Hop­kins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who was not in­volved in the study. “I could imag­ine this be­ing part of the arse­nal.”</p>
    <p>The work has been un­der way for months by sci­en­tists from Columbia Univer­sity Med­i­cal Cen­tre in New York, Eras­mus Med­i­cal Cen­tre in the Nether­lands, and Cor­nell Univer­sity in Ithaca, New York. The team would re­quire ad­di­tional fund­ing to pur­sue clin­i­cal tri­als in hu­mans.</p>
    <p>The spray at­tacks the virus di­rectly. It con­tains a lipopep­tide, a choles­terol par­ti­cle linked to a chain of amino acids, the build­ing blocks of pro­teins. This par­tic­u­lar lipopep­tide ex­actly matches a stretch of amino acids in the spike pro­tein of the virus, which the pathogen uses to at­tach to a hu­man air­way or lung cell.</p>
    <p>Be­fore a virus can in­ject its RNA into a cell, the spike must ef­fec­tively un­zip, ex­pos­ing two chains of amino acids, in or­der to fuse to the cell wall. As the spike zips back up to com­plete the process, the lipopep­tide in the spray in­serts it­self, latch­ing on to one of the spike’s amino acid chains and pre­vent­ing the virus from at­tach­ing.</p>
    <p>“It is like you are zip­ping a zip­per but you put an­other zip­per in­side, so the two sides can­not meet,” said mi­cro­bi­ol­o­gist Mat­teo Porotto from Columbia Univer­sity and one of the pa­per’s au­thors.</p>
    <p>The work has been sub­mit­ted to the jour­nal Sci­ence for peer re­view.</p>
    <p>In the study, the spray was given to six fer­rets, which were then di­vided into pairs and placed in three cages.</p>
    <p>Into each cage also went two fer­rets that had been given a placebo spray and one fer­ret that had been de­lib­er­ately in­fected with SarsCoV-2 a day or two ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Fer­rets are used by sci­en­tists study­ing flu, se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome (Sars) and other res­pi­ra­tory dis­eases be­cause they can catch viruses through the nose like hu­mans do, al­though they also in­fect each other by con­tact with fae­ces or by scratch­ing and bit­ing.</p>
    <p>Af­ter 24 hours, none of the sprayed fer­rets caught the dis­ease; all the placebo-group fer­rets did. “Virus repli­ca­tion was com­pletely blocked,” the au­thors wrote.</p>
    <p>The pro­tec­tive spray at­taches to cells in the nose and lungs and lasts about 24 hours, Dr Anne Moscona, a pae­di­a­tri­cian and mi­cro­bi­ol­o­gist at Columbia and co-author of the study, said.</p>
    <p>“If it works this well in hu­mans, you could sleep in a bed with some­one in­fected or be with your in­fected kids and still be safe,” she said.</p>
    <p>The amino acids come from a stretch of the spike pro­tein in coro­n­aviruses that rarely mu­tates. The sci­en­tists tested it against four dif­fer­ent vari­ants of the virus, in­clud­ing both the well-known “Wuhan” and “Ital­ian” strains, and also against the coro­n­aviruses that cause Sars and the Mid­dle East res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome (Mers).</p>
    <p>In cell cul­tures, it pro­tected com­pletely against all strains of the pan­demic virus, fairly well against Sars and par­tially against Mers.</p>
    <p>The lipopro­tein can be in­ex­pen­sively pro­duced as a freeze-dried white pow­der that does not need re­frig­er­a­tion, Dr Moscona said. A doc­tor or phar­ma­cist could mix the pow­der with sugar and wa­ter to pro­duce a nasal spray.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian sci­en­tists have tested a nasal spray against Covid-19 in fer­rets, but it works by en­hanc­ing the im­mune sys­tem, not by tar­get­ing the virus di­rectly.</p>
    <p>As lipopep­tides can be shipped as a dry pow­der, they could be used even in ru­ral ar­eas in poor coun­tries that lack re­frig­er­a­tion, Dr Moscona said.</p>
