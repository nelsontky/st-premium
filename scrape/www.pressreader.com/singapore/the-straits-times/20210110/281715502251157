    <p>BEI­JING • A Chi­nese for­mer jour­nal­ist who once urged the United States to help “tear down” Bei­jing’s on­line cen­sor­ship regime has been sen­tenced to 11/ years in jail. 2</p>
    <p>Zhang Jia­long’s sen­tence last Fri­day comes more than a year af­ter he was de­tained by the po­lice for “pick­ing quar­rels and pro­vok­ing trou­bles”, an ac­cu­sa­tion of­ten used against hu­man rights ac­tivists and dis­si­dents in China.</p>
    <p>Zhang, 32, made head­lines in 2014 when he met for­mer US sec­re­tary of state John Kerry in Bei­jing and re­quested his help to “tear down the Great Fire­wall of cen­sor­ship”.</p>
    <p>The fire­wall refers to the coun­try’s re­stric­tions on cit­i­zens that pre­vent them from ac­cess­ing in­ter­na­tional sites such as Google, or read­ing on­line news crit­i­cal of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party.</p>
    <p>Zhang’s wife Shao Yuan told Agence France-Presse yes­ter­day that she learnt of his sen­tence from his lawyer last Fri­day, and had mixed feel­ings about the out­come.</p>
    <p>Zhang has al­ready been in de­ten­tion since Au­gust 2019, time which counts to­wards his sen­tence, mean­ing he will likely be re­leased be­fore Chi­nese New Year, she said.</p>
    <p>“Our child and I have been look­ing for­ward to his re­turn... the process has been very long and very pain­ful.</p>
    <p>“But at the same time, I’m sad and wor­ried. I’m sad be­cause... such a right­eous and kind per­son was taken and sen­tenced.”</p>
    <p>Tweets by Zhang on social me­dia, in­clud­ing a se­ries he wrote on In­ter­net free­doms and hu­man rights, were pre­sented in court as ev­i­dence of his ide­o­log­i­cal views, Ms Shao said.</p>
    <p>Zhang was fired from his job at In­ter­net firm Ten­cent shortly af­ter his 2014 meet­ing with Mr Kerry, and has since main­tained a low pro­file.</p>
    <p>As a re­porter for fi­nan­cial news out­let Cai­jing, he was de­tained for three days in 2011 over posts about the demolition of artist and dis­si­dent Ai Wei­wei’s work­shop in Shang­hai.</p>
