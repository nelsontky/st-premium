    <p>BEI­JING • China and the United States have agreed to hold trade talks in the com­ing days to eval­u­ate the progress of their phase one trade deal six months after it took ef­fect in Fe­bru­ary, the Chi­nese Com­merce Min­istry said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Min­istry spokesman Gao Feng made the com­ments at a weekly brief­ing held on­line, but did not elab­o­rate.</p>
    <p>The com­ments came after Tues­day’s re­marks by White House Chief of Staff Mark Mead­ows that no new high-level trade talks had been sched­uled, though both sides were in touch about im­ple­ment­ing the phase one deal.</p>
    <p>The deal – which was reached on Jan 15 and was seen as a ma­jor break­through after a two-year-long trade dis­pute be­tween the world’s two largest economies – set am­bi­tious tar­gets for China to sharply boost its pur­chases of US farm and man­u­fac­tured goods.</p>
    <p>But re­la­tions quickly soured in the af­ter­math of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and China’s im­po­si­tion of a new na­tional se­cu­rity law in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Both sides have traded threats and sanc­tions on in­di­vid­u­als and busi­nesses, such as Chi­nese video-shar­ing plat­form TikTok, in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cial data also sug­gests that China’s im­ports of US farm and man­u­fac­tured goods, en­ergy and ser­vices are well be­hind the pace needed to meet a first-year tar­get in­crease of US$77 bil­lion (S$105 bil­lion) over 2017 pur­chases.</p>
    <p>China’s pur­chases have in­creased as its econ­omy re­cov­ers from its strin­gent coro­n­avirus lock­down, how­ever.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump told re­porters that he had post­poned an Aug 15 re­view of the trade pact, in frus­tra­tion over Bei­jing’s han­dling of the virus pan­demic.</p>
