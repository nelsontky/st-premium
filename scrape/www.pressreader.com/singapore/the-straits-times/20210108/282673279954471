    <p>Those who miss the wood-fired piz­zas at the now-closed Modesto’s can savour those Ital­ian flavours once more.</p>
    <p>Its group head chef Eric Cheah, 48, teamed up with other for­mer col­leagues to start a new ven­ture, Eric’s Bistro, which opened in Septem­ber. Most of the items on its menu would be fa­mil­iar to Modesto’s reg­u­lars. The main dif­fer­ence is that the piz­zas at Eric’s Bistro are cooked in an elec­tric oven in­stead.</p>
    <p>I find the Misto Carne pizza ($23.50+) sat­is­fy­ing. The thin crust is crispy and the top­ping of pork salami, cooked pork ham, chicken sausage and slices of in-house mar­i­nated chicken thigh is ten­der and tasty.</p>
    <p>For­get the deep-fried Cala­mari, listed on the menu un­der ap­pe­tis­ers. In­stead, in­sist on the off-menu grilled ver­sion ($17.50+). The bistro uses fresh squid which is sea­soned with spices in­spired by the grilled skew­ers of Dong­bei cui­sine. Cumin and chilli pow­der give the squid aroma, flavour and just enough heat.</p>
    <p>It does not need any condi­ments, but the dish comes with the house­made gar­lic chilli dip that was a hit at Modesto’s. The recipe came from chef Cheah, who was in­spired by his Hainanese ma­ter­nal grand­mother’s recipe for chicken rice chilli.</p>
    <p>Another dish that is new to the bistro is Spring Chicken ($24+). In­stead of the pan-fried ver­sion at Modesto’s, the spring chicken here is mar­i­nated overnight in spices such as fresh gin­ger, gar­lic, onion and curry pow­der. The curry pow­der is dusted off be­fore deep-fry­ing, which pre­vents the bird’s skin from get­ting burnt. The spices thor­oughly per­me­ate the meat, which is juicy.</p>
    <p>The por­tions here are good for shar­ing and of­fer value for money.</p>
    <p>Other dishes to try in­clude Zup­petta Pesce ($16.50+), a tomato-based soup with seafood. The venus clams are fresh, not frozen, and the bistro makes its own clam stock.</p>
    <p>A good dessert of­fer­ing is the house­made Panna Cotta ($10+), made with vanilla seeds hand-scraped from the pod.</p>
    <p>The restau­rant cur­rently of­fers an open­ing pro­mo­tion of 20 per cent off food items for din­ner (3 to 11pm) and 30 per cent off food items for lunch (11.30am to 3pm). The pro­mo­tion ends on Feb 28. WHERE 7 Hoe Chi­ang Road MRT Tan­jong Pa­gar OPEN 11.30am to 11pm daily</p>
