    <p>By end De­cem­ber, check­ing in with the TraceTo­gether app or to­ken will be manda­tory at venues in­clud­ing restau­rants, work­places, schools and shop­ping malls, as Sin­ga­pore pre­pares for phase three of its re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>This means no one will be able to gain en­try to th­ese places by scan­ning SafeEn­try QR codes with their phone cam­eras, or through the SingPass mo­bile app or bar­codes on their NRIC.</p>
    <p>SafeEn­try, the na­tion’s dig­i­tal check-in sys­tem, is cur­rently man­dated at all th­ese places.</p>
    <p>When the new rule kicks in, peo­ple must in­stead use the TraceTo­gether app or to­ken. The app in­cludes a func­tion for scan­ning SafeEn­try QR codes, while the to­kens sport a QR code with a sim­i­lar func­tion.</p>
    <p>Manda­tory use of TraceTo­gether will be in­tro­duced at cin­e­mas from next Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The TraceTo­gether app and to­ken work by ex­chang­ing short-dis­tance Blue­tooth sig­nals with other TraceTo­gether apps or to­kens nearby. This prox­im­ity data, which is en­crypted and stored for 25 days be­fore be­ing au­to­mat­i­cally deleted, al­lows quick con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>About 45 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion is on the TraceTo­gether pro­gramme now.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, co-chair of the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling Covid-19, said at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day that a 70 per cent take-up rate for the TraceTo­gether app is one of the con­di­tions that could help Sin­ga­pore get to phase three of its re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>“When we have both a higher take-up rate of TraceTo­gether and wider de­ploy­ment of TraceTo­gether-only SafeEn­try... and com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion through­out this pe­riod re­mains low, then there is a good chance of us en­ter­ing phase three... by the end of the year,” he said.</p>
    <p>Phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing was meant to l ast sev­eral months, even as more mea­sures are lifted, while phase three is the “new nor­mal” un­til a vac­cine or treat­ment is de­vel­oped for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Other venues and events that will have manda­tory TraceTo­gether check-in in­clude places of wor­ship with more than 100 peo­ple, live per­for­mances and busi­ness events, said the Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment Group (SNDGG).</p>
    <p>Check­ing in with TraceTo­gether en­sures that if a Covid-19 case is iden­ti­fied, the au­thor­i­ties can quickly in­form close con­tacts in those lo­ca­tions through the TraceTo­gether Pro­gramme, SNDGG said.</p>
    <p>Close con­tacts can then im­me­di­ately take the nec­es­sary pre­cau­tions to keep their loved ones safe.</p>
    <p>The rolling out of TraceTo­geth­eronly SafeEn­try will be done in con­junc­tion with the ex­panded dis­tri­bu­tion of TraceTo­gether to­kens.</p>
    <p>The to­kens are be­ing dis­trib­uted at 38 com­mu­nity cen­tres. By the end of next month, TraceTo­gether to­kens will be avail­able at all 108 com­mu­nity cen­tres is­land­wide.</p>
    <p>TraceTo­gether mo­bile booths, where to­kens can be col­lected, have also been set up at shop­ping malls.</p>
    <p>The full de­ploy­ment sched­ule and list of lo­ca­tions can be found on the To­kenGoWhere web­site.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, SNDGG said more than 100,000 to­kens had been col­lected.</p>
