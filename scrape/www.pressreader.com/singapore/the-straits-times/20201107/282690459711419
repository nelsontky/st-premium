    <p>Main­board-listed telco StarHub is still reel­ing from the im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic on con­sumer de­mand, which has pushed down its third-quar­ter earn­ings.</p>
    <p>Net profit came in lower by 23.3 per cent year on year to $44.5 mil­lion for the three months to Sept 30, ac­cord­ing to fi­nan­cial re­sults re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Over­all rev­enue fell by 14.5 per cent to $489.7 mil­lion, while ser­vice rev­enue – which ex­cludes equip­ment sales – dropped by 10.6 per cent to $388.7 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Chief cor­po­rate of­fi­cer Veron­ica Lai said in a state­ment that busi­ness had “a mod­est pickup” in the sec­ond phase of Sin­ga­pore’s three-stage eco­nomic re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, our Q3 2020 per­for­mance con­tin­ued to see im­pact from the on­go­ing global re­stric­tions on travel, par­tic­u­larly for our mo­bile busi­ness,” she added.</p>
    <p>Mr Peter Kaliaropou­los, who re­signed as chief ex­ec­u­tive for fam­ily rea­sons, left last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>StarHub’s ser­vice earn­ings be­fore in­ter­est, taxes, de­pre­ci­a­tion and amor­ti­sa­tion (Ebitda) mar­gin will most likely be weaker in the fourth quar­ter than in the third, the com­pany said, citing con­tin­ued pres­sure of bor­der con­trols on rev­enue, and a sea­sonal rise in op­er­at­ing ex­penses.</p>
    <p>The group added in its out­look state­ment that it ex­pects to main­tain its ear­lier guid­ance for FY2020, which pro­jected a ser­vice rev­enue de­cline of 10 per cent to 12 per cent.</p>
    <p>The core mo­bile ser­vice busi­ness’ third-quar­ter turnover tanked, with rev­enue down by 29.4 per cent to $134.1 mil­lion. StarHub at­trib­uted the fall to fac­tors such as re­duced travel amid the pan­demic, which ate into both post-paid and pre­paid rev­enues.</p>
    <p>On the bright side, en­ter­prise busi­ness ser­vices con­tin­ued to cush­ion the blow to the top line, post­ing rev­enue growth of 11.4 per cent to $162 mil­lion.</p>
