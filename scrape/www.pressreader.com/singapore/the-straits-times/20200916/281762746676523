    <p>Un­der­grad­u­ate Nur Syazwan Syam­sud­din’s life hit a rough patch in April when his par­ents tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>To make mat­ters worse, Mr Syazwan, 23, con­tracted the coro­n­avirus too.</p>
    <p>Then, his mother lost her teach­ing job at a pre-school which closed down while she was in hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>To make ends meet, he and his two younger sib­lings pitched in to help, with Mr Syazwan, a sec­ondyear stu­dent at the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy (SIT), sign­ing up as a GrabFood de­liv­ery rider.</p>
    <p>Last month, he re­ceived $2,000 from SIT’s stu­dent re­lief fund, which helped ease the bur­den of pay­ing for house­hold bills and gro­ceries on his father, a Cus­toms of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>Mr Syazwan is among more than 450 SIT stu­dents who have re­ceived help from the fund, set up ear­lier this year to help stu­dents whose fam­i­lies have been hit by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Nearly $1.5 mil­lion has been raised for the fund through do­na­tions, and it is be­ing dis­bursed to more stu­dents. Each stu­dent gets up to $2,000 to cover liv­ing and other nec­es­sary ex­penses.</p>
    <p>Mr Syazwan, who is study­ing com­puter sci­ence in real-time in­ter­ac­tive sim­u­la­tion, said: “My mum has been very wor­ried about fi­nances.</p>
    <p>“She wants to find a job but is un­able to do so, as she’s still re­cov­er­ing.” She is still feel­ing weak after be­ing dis­charged from hos­pi­tal, where she spent 20 days in the in­ten­sive care unit due to breath­ing dif­fi­cul­ties, he added.</p>
    <p>SIT brought for­ward by two months to April its win­dow for stu­dents to ap­ply for fi­nan­cial aid, due to the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>It has since re­ceived more than 3,800 ap­pli­ca­tions for bur­saries, schol­ar­ships and grants, in­clud­ing the re­lief fund. This is up by nearly 10 per cent com­pared with the pre­vi­ous aca­demic year.</p>
    <p>SIT has about 8,000 stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Its pres­i­dent Tan Thiam Soon said the univer­sity is “ex­tremely grate­ful” for “this very timely sup­port from the com­mu­nity”.</p>
    <p>“For many (stu­dents), the pan­demic has led to a loss of employment and in­come within the fam­ily,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing more donors step for­ward to help would cer­tainly al­le­vi­ate the fi­nan­cial bur­den faced by these stu­dents (and their fam­i­lies), so they can bet­ter focus on their stud­ies.”</p>
    <p>SIT third-year hospi­tal­ity busi­ness stu­dent Vanessa Chia re­ceived $2,000 from the fund, after her par­ents’ in­comes nearly dried up dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Her father had to stop work as a taxi driver after testing pos­i­tive for Covid-19 in April and was hos­pi­talised for 11/ months. He re­cently</p>
    <p>2 signed up as a Grab driver.</p>
    <p>Her mother, a hair­styl­ist, was put on un­paid leave for a few months be­fore re­turn­ing to work in June, after the cir­cuit breaker was lifted.</p>
    <p>Ms Chia, 23, said she tried look­ing for a part-time job but was un­able to find one that suited her timetable.</p>
    <p>The SIT funds, she added, helped to cover part of her per­sonal ex­penses, such as phone bills and food.</p>
    <p>She said: “(With the fi­nan­cial help), I won’t have to pester my par­ents for an al­lowance.</p>
    <p>“They’re still cop­ing bet­ter than a lot of other peo­ple I know, but the job sit­u­a­tion was a bit stress­ful for ev­ery­one.”</p>
    <p>The past few months were also tough for sec­ond-year nurs­ing stu­dent Sathiya Soo­rian’s fam­ily.</p>
    <p>His mother, a ho­tel re­cep­tion­ist, had to take a pay cut of more than 50 per cent from April.</p>
    <p>His father was hos­pi­talised twice in the past few months and un­der­went op­er­a­tions for his di­a­betic con­di­tion. He has since stopped work as a taxi driver and is un­der­go­ing re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Soo­rian, 26, re­ceived $1,500 from the re­lief fund, which helped pay for food and phone bills.</p>
    <p>“I’m still care­ful with my ex­pen­di­ture, but at least my par­ents don’t have to worry so much about me,” he said.</p>
