    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO • Collin Morikawa dis­played nerves of steel in the fi­nal round of the PGA Cham­pi­onship on Sun­day, fend­ing off a slew of big names to grab his first Ma­jor and en­sure he will no longer fly un­der the radar.</p>
    <p>In only his sec­ond ca­reer Ma­jor start, the 23-year-old was a model of pre­ci­sion at TPC Hard­ing Park where he fi­nally pulled away from a tight leader­board with a re­mark­able drive that set up a late ea­gle.</p>
    <p>“In the strokes-gained era, this is the first time a player has ever led in fair­ways hit, prox­im­ity to the hole and strokes-gained putting,” said Golf Chan­nel an­a­lyst Bran­del Cham­blee.</p>
    <p>“You put all that to­gether and it’s just not fair that some­body af­ter 29 events on the PGA Tour has all of those skills and has their whole ca­reer in front of them.”</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can, who last month picked up his sec­ond ca­reer PGA Tour win at the Work­day Char­ity Open in Muir­field, was not on any­one’s radar at the year’s first Ma­jor un­til fir­ing a five-un­der 65 in the third round that left him two shots back of the leader.</p>
    <p>In the fi­nal round, he de­liv­ered the drive of his life at the par-four 16th, which led to an ea­gle that all but clinched the Wana­maker Tro­phy and ce­mented his place among the cast of young standouts in the golf­ing world.</p>
    <p>“There’s a ma­tu­rity there that at 23, it shouldn’t ex­ist,” for­mer Bri­tish Open cham­pion Justin Leonard said of Morikawa.</p>
    <p>“The skill set that he has is a lit­tle dif­fer­ent than what we see in a mod­ern young player.”</p>
    <p>Morikawa, who was 65th in the rank­ings at the end of last year, shot up seven places to world No. 5 af­ter his win, is ea­ger to rel­ish the spot­light, though, he is any­thing but com­pla­cent af­ter the big­gest win of his ca­reer.</p>
    <p>“When I woke up (on Sun­day), I was like, this is meant to be. This is where I feel very com­fort­able. This is where I want to be, and I’m not scared from it,” he said. “It doesn’t stop here. I’ve got a very good taste of what this is like, what a Ma­jor cham­pi­onship is like.”</p>
    <p>Since turn­ing pro in May of last year, his PGA Tour record has been stun­ning – with three wins, two sec­onds, four other top-10s and only one missed cut in 27 pro events.</p>
    <p>Only 15-time Ma­jor cham­pion Tiger Woods boasts a bet­ter record than Morikawa’s 22 straight week­ends played to start his ca­reer.</p>
    <p>Yet golf is lit­tered with hype trains who have fiz­zled out. In 2017, Justin Spi­eth, days just shy of his 24th birth­day, was on the cusp of a ca­reer Grand Slam, af­ter win­ning the Open Cham­pi­onship, leav­ing him one Ma­jor short of the feat.</p>
    <p>He had won both the Masters and the US Open two years ear­lier, and seemed set for a long stay at world No. 1. On Sun­day, he fin­ished 71st out of the 79 players who made the cut at Hard­ing Park and hav­ing failed to win on the Tour since his Open tri­umph, his stock has fallen quite dra­mat­i­cally – to No. 60.</p>
    <p>Even Rory McIl­roy, who un­til the coro­n­avirus stop­page in March was the most in-form player on the Tour, is start­ing to won­der whether the magic has gone af­ter his five-year Ma­jor drought was pro­longed, say­ing “maybe I’m not as good as I was”.</p>
    <p>But Morikawa’s cad­die, J. J. Jako­vac, be­lieves he is cut from a dif­fer­ent cloth. “All my cad­die friends say the same thing,” he said. “They’re like, I just can­not get over how ma­ture your guy is. He’s like an old soul or some­thing.”</p>
