    <p>A 64-year-old man was charged yes­ter­day over the Lucky Plaza crash that killed two do­mes­tic helpers last December.</p>
    <p>Malaysian Chong Kim Hoe, whose car al­legedly ploughed into six Filipino women, is now fac­ing three dan­ger­ous driv­ing charges.</p>
    <p>Two of the women were killed, three suf­fered griev­ous hurt, and a sixth was hurt in the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Chong, a Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent, is said to have en­gaged the ac­cel­er­a­tor as he was mak­ing a U-turn while driv­ing along Nut­meg Road be­hind the Or­chard Road shop­ping mall at around 5pm on Dec 29 last year.</p>
    <p>He al­legedly drove onto a nearby foot­way, through a guard rail and onto a Lucky Plaza ser­vice road, hit­ting the six women.</p>
    <p>Two of them, Ms Abi­gail Danao Leste, 41, and Ms Ar­lyn Picar Nu­cos, 50, died.</p>
    <p>Ms Arceli Picar Nu­cos, 56, as well as Ms Eg­nal Layu­gan Lim­bauan and Ms Laila Flo­res Lau­den­cia, both 44, were griev­ously hurt.</p>
    <p>Ms Demet Lim­bauan Lim­bauan, 37, was also in­jured.</p>
    <p>De­tails about the women’s in­juries were not re­vealed in court doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>Ms Ar­lyn Picar Nu­cos was Ms Arceli Picar Nu­cos’ sis­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Daniel Men­doza, 34, the man­ager of a travel agency at Lucky Plaza, had ear­lier told The Straits Times that he was on a pave­ment near the shop­ping mall when the in­ci­dent oc­curred.</p>
    <p>He said: “Ev­ery­one was of course shocked and many were scream­ing ‘help, God, help, God.’”</p>
    <p>A video – which ap­pears to be footage of the crash taken from closed-circuit tele­vi­sion cam­eras – had also made the rounds on­line.</p>
    <p>It shows a car mak­ing a U-turn be­fore ac­cel­er­at­ing across the ad­ja­cent lane and into a group of peo­ple on a pave­ment.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the crash, more than $360,000 was raised in an on­line fund-raiser that closed on Jan 6.</p>
    <p>The Cen­tre for Do­mes­tic Em­ploy­ees (CDE), together with the Do­mes­tic Em­ploy­ees Wel­fare Fund, col­lected the sum from nearly 3,000 donors in about a week, ac­cord­ing to fig­ures on fund-rais­ing web­site Giv­ing.sg.</p>
    <p>All pro­ceeds in the fund-rais­ing cam­paign – which started on Dec 30 last year – were to go di­rectly to­wards help­ing the four in­jured</p>
    <p>maids and the de­pen­dants of the two dead women.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post in January, CDE chair­man Yeo Guat Kwang thanked mem­bers of the pub­lic for their gen­eros­ity.</p>
    <p>Chong’s bail was set at $15,000 yes­ter­day, and his pre-trial con­fer­ence will be held on Sept 25.</p>
