    <p>SEOUL • An ap­par­ently emo­tional Mr Kim Jong Un apol­o­gised for fail­ing to im­prove North Kore­ans’ lives in an ad­dress at an un­prece­dented predawn mil­i­tary pa­rade yes­ter­day that show­cased the coun­try’s lon­grange bal­lis­tic mis­siles for the first time in two years.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts said the mis­sile which was shown on a trans­porter ve­hi­cle with 11 axles would be one of the largest road-mo­bile in­ter­con­ti­nen­tal bal­lis­tic mis­siles in the world if it be­comes op­er­a­tional.</p>
    <p>Also dis­played were the Hwa­song-15, which is the long­est-range mis­sile ever tested by North Korea, and what ap­peared to be a new sub­ma­rine-launched bal­lis­tic mis­sile.</p>
    <p>Ahead of the pa­rade, which was held to mark the 75th an­niver­sary of the found­ing of North Korea’s rul­ing Work­ers’ Party, of­fi­cials in South Korea and the United States said Mr Kim could use the event to un­veil a new “strate­gic weapon” as promised ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>The pa­rade fea­tured bal­lis­tic mis­siles for the first time since Mr Kim be­gan meet­ing in­ter­na­tional lead­ers, in­clud­ing US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, in 2018.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to build our na­tional de­fence power and self-de­fen­sive war de­ter­rence,” Mr Kim said, but vowed that the coun­try’s mil­i­tary power would not be used pre­emp­tively. He made no di­rect men­tion of the United States or the now-stalled de­nu­cle­ari­sa­tion talks.</p>
    <p>State news agency KCNA, mean­while, said the au­thor­ity and se­cu­rity of North Korea hinged on “the huge nu­clear strate­gic forces” shown in the pa­rade.</p>
    <p>Mr Chad O’Car­roll, CEO of the Korea Risk Group which mon­i­tors North Korea, said more new mil­i­tary hard­ware had been dis­played at this event than at nearly any other pre­vi­ous pa­rade.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim blamed in­ter­na­tional sanc­tions, ty­phoons and the coro­n­avirus pan­demic for pre­vent­ing him from de­liv­er­ing on prom­ises of eco­nomic progress.</p>
    <p>“I am ashamed that I have never been able to re­pay you prop­erly for your enor­mous trust,” he said. “My ef­forts and de­vo­tion were not suf­fi­cient to bring our peo­ple out of dif­fi­cult liveli­hoods.”</p>
    <p>Video footage of the event showed Mr Kim making an ap­pear­ance as a clock struck mid­night. Dressed in a grey suit and tie, he waved to the crowd and ac­cepted flow­ers from chil­dren while sur­rounded by mil­i­tary of­fi­cials i n Py­ongyang’s re­cently ren­o­vated Kim Il Sung Square.</p>
    <p>At times appearing emo­tional, Mr Kim thanked the mil­i­tary for work­ing hard to re­spond to a se­ries of dam­ag­ing sum­mer ty­phoons, and for pre­vent­ing a coro­n­avirus out­break in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim said he was grate­ful that not a sin­gle North Korean had tested pos­i­tive for the dis­ease, an as­ser­tion that South Korea and the US have pre­vi­ously ques­tioned.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim said he hopes that both Koreas will join hands again af­ter the coro­n­avirus cri­sis is over.</p>
    <p>“It is an im­pres­sively large gath­er­ing dur­ing a global pan­demic, sug­gest­ing that the North Korean au­thor­i­ties are con­cerned more with po­lit­i­cal history and na­tional morale than with pre­vent­ing a Covid-19 su­per­spreader event,” said Professor Leif-Eric Easley, who teaches at Ewha Wo­mans Univer­sity in Seoul.</p>
    <p>In a con­grat­u­la­tory mes­sage to Mr Kim on the an­niver­sary, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jinping said he in­tended to “de­fend, con­sol­i­date and de­velop” ties with North Korea, its state me­dia said yes­ter­day.</p>
