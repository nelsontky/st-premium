    <p>Wide­spread travel curbs and thin­ning vis­i­tor ar­rivals have bat­tered the hos­pi­tal­ity in­dus­try but new ho­tels con­tinue to open, in­clud­ing three this month. And more than 8,600 new ho­tel rooms re­main in the pipe­line as at the third quar­ter of this year, ac­cord­ing to the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity.</p>
    <p>Wide­spread travel re­stric­tions and thin­ning vis­i­tor ar­rivals have bat­tered the hos­pi­tal­ity in­dus­try but new ho­tels con­tinue to open, in­clud­ing three this month.</p>
    <p>Op­ti­mism in the in­dus­try about a re­bound next year re­mains ro­bust de­spite this year’s dis­mal show­ing.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age oc­cu­pancy rate of gazetted ho­tels in Oc­to­ber was 56.7 per cent, a fall of 30.3 per­cent­age point over the same pe­riod last year, said the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board.</p>
    <p>Yet more than 8,600 new ho­tel rooms re­main in the pipe­line as at the third quar­ter of this year, ac­cord­ing to the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity, com­pared with 8,200 or so at the end of last year.</p>
    <p>This, de­spite pan­demic-re­lated con­struc­tion de­lays for de­vel­op­ers, said Col­liers In­ter­na­tional (Sin­ga­pore) re­search head Tri­cia Song.</p>
    <p>Key open­ings over the next two years in­clude the 324-room The Clan by Far East Hos­pi­tal­ity, the 169-room Ci­tadines Con­nect City Cen­tre and the 135-room Ci­tadines Con­nect Rochester Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Two new brands will also be launched with the 204-room Edi­tion by Mar­riott and the 350-room Pull­man Sin­ga­pore in Hill Street, said CBRE Ho­tels Asia-Pa­cific as­so­ciate di­rec­tor Zhang Ji­a­hao, who noted the open­ings re­flect hote­liers’ con­fi­dence in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Most of the new devel­op­ments are in the up­scale to mid-tier range in the Or­chard area and the Cen­tral Busi­ness Dis­trict.</p>
    <p>“This sig­nals the au­thor­i­ties’ vi­sion to mar­ket Sin­ga­pore as a des­ti­na­tion of choice for global trav­ellers of dif­fer­ent trav­el­ling bud­get and style,” Mr Zhang said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has re­cip­ro­cal green lane ar­range­ments for short-term es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial travel with Brunei, Ger­many, In­done­sia, Ja­pan, Malaysia, South Korea and six Chi­nese cities.</p>
    <p>Some ho­tels opened this month, amid the on­go­ing pan­demic. They in­clude Dusit Thani La­guna Sin­ga­pore, the Mint Ho­tel as part of One Far­rer Ho­tel, and the Parkroyal Col­lec­tion Ma­rina Bay un­der the Pan</p>
    <p>Pa­cific Ho­tels Group.</p>
    <p>The Parkroyal Col­lec­tion Ma­rina Bay opened on Dec 1 with 200 rooms, and just over 100 were checked in to on the first day. All of the ho­tel’s 583 rooms will be open by May.</p>
    <p>Pan Pa­cific Ho­tels Group chief ex­ec­u­tive Choe Peng Sum said: “Our plans are still chug­ging along. The cir­cuit breaker pushed ev­ery­thing back a bit, but once that was done, it was all back to work.”</p>
    <p>De­mand has al­ready been very en­cour­ag­ing, with sup­port from lo­cals, he added, not­ing that pa­trons can use its ho­tels as bases to re­dis­cover ar­eas such as Haji Lane, Lit­tle In­dia, Chi­na­town and Ma­rina Bay.</p>
    <p>Mr Choe noted ho­tels also have “third places”, lo­ca­tions that are sep­a­rate from the home or work­place where peo­ple can so­cialise, such as cafes and li­braries.</p>
    <p>“This can help peo­ple to have ‘work-cations’ where they take their work to the ho­tel,” he said.</p>
    <p>The bullish­ness about a re­cov­ery is shared by other hote­liers.</p>
    <p>Dusit Thani La­guna Sin­ga­pore opened on Dec 4 at the La­guna Na­tional Golf and Coun­try Club. It has about 150 staff and 198 rooms.</p>
    <p>Gen­eral man­ager Eric Pi­atti said: “In the short term, the in­dus­try will face chal­lenges. But it will also be marked by in­no­va­tion and new ex­pe­ri­ences, as the in­dus­try searches and ex­per­i­ments with new so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>“The de­mand for well­ness ex­pe­ri­ences among dis­cern­ing trav­ellers is ex­pected to con­tinue on an up­ward tra­jec­tory as peo­ple be­come in­creas­ingly health con­scious amid the pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Open­ing a ho­tel dur­ing a pan­demic sig­nals the level of op­ti­mism in the sec­tor but it also brings huge new chal­lenges for hote­liers.</p>
    <p>The most press­ing is the huge out­lay of money and time that has to be spent on fre­quent clean­ing and sani­tis­ing to en­sure peace of mind for guests.</p>
    <p>Around $2 mil­lion has been spent at the One Far­rer Ho­tel at Far­rer Park on re­design­ing gue­strooms, fa­cil­i­ties and pro­cesses, with in­put from med­i­cal ex­perts.</p>
    <p>It also led to the open­ing of Mint Ho­tel this month, a cat­e­gory of rooms within the One Far­rer Ho­tel.</p>
    <p>The 176 Mint rooms have anti-vi­ral wall cov­er­ings, move­able fur­ni­ture and anti-mi­cro­bial blind fab­rics so guest rooms can be sani­tised more thor­oughly.</p>
    <p>Car­pets have also been re­moved from gue­strooms and com­mon ar­eas and re­placed with gap­less vinyl floor­ing, which does not trap dirt and can be more eas­ily cleaned and dis­in­fected.</p>
    <p>One Far­rer Ho­tel gen­eral man­ager Gil­bert Mad­ha­van said: “We con­cep­tu­alised the re­fur­bish­ment of One Far­rer Ho­tel upon the on­set of Covid-19, tak­ing into con­sid­er­a­tion all the dif­fer­ent con­cerns guests may have. We’ve im­ple­mented the high­est pos­si­ble stan­dard of hy­giene and clean­li­ness in all as­pects of our ser­vice, from the tra­di­tional con­tact­less en­try points and sani­tiser sta­tions to launch­ing the Mint Ho­tel.”</p>
    <p>At the Parkroyal Col­lec­tion Ma­rina Bay, which launched on Dec 1, gen­eral man­ager Melvin Lim ac­knowl­edged there are added costs due to more fre­quent clean­ing and in­creased staffing, in­clud­ing the re­cruit­ment of its own safety am­bas­sadors.</p>
    <p>It also worked with Amer­i­can com­pany Di­versey to get hos­pi­tal-grade clean­ing equip­ment. Lifts and com­mon sur­faces have also been coated with an anti-mi­cro­bial sub­stance.</p>
    <p>Eater­ies use e-menus to avoid con­tact and pa­trons may even­tu­ally be able to check in on their phones and even have room key cards on their phones.</p>
    <p>Some ar­eas will also have ca­pac­ity lim­its, such as al­low­ing only 23 peo­ple in the pool and seven in the gym at any time. Pa­trons will have to use a dig­i­tal concierge ser­vice to e-book their slots.</p>
    <p>The Dusit Thani La­guna Sin­ga­pore ho­tel, which opened on Dec 4, is also tak­ing ex­tra steps to en­sure the safety of guests. It in­stalled a sys­tem to screen vis­i­tors’ tem­per­a­tures and record their en­try and exit from the premises for con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>Gen­eral man­ager Eric Pi­atti said: “These new ser­vices will al­low guests to check in at any time they wish... and make pay­ment through their mo­bile de­vices. Vir­tual con­tact­less check-in is also of­fered as an op­tion.”</p>
    <p>The ho­tel will also help to host hy­brid meet­ings and other events, where vir­tual el­e­ments like live-stream­ing tech­nol­ogy can be com­bined with phys­i­cal meet­ings. This tech­nol­ogy in­cludes an e-net­work plat­form, where guests can reg­is­ter to in­ter­act with one an­other while event or­gan­is­ers can con­duct real-time polling with del­e­gates.</p>
