    <p>Our great­est weak­ness lies in giv­ing up. The most cer­tain way to suc­ceed is al­ways to try just one more time.</p>
    <p>This hor­mone (adren­a­line) shuts down our di­ges­tion sys­tem and re­duces our ap­petite. How­ever, if stress per­sists, our bod­ies pro­duce an­other hor­mone known as cor­ti­sol.</p>
    <p>Cor­ti­sol in­creases our ap­petite and our mo­ti­va­tion as well, in­clud­ing the mo­ti­va­tion to eat, which may lead to overeat­ing be­hav­iours.</p>
    <p>MS TOH HUI MOON, a clin­i­cal psy­chol­o­gist at the Na­tional Univer­sity Poly­clin­ics, on how a stress­ful sit­u­a­tion af­fects a per­son’s fight-or-flight re­sponse</p>
    <p>Ac­count man­ager Sally Ng has had a greater work­load – and a higher level of stress – since she started work­ing from home in April.</p>
    <p>To cope with the changes, she turned to un­healthy meals at ir­reg­u­lar hours and snacked too much.</p>
    <p>The 45-year-old, who is sin­gle, some­times works as long as 16 hours a day and finds snack­ing a “con­ve­nient way to stay alert”.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Ng: “Eat­ing in­stant noo­dles is an easy op­tion when I’m busy, and sug­ary foods such as choco­lates, sweets and bis­cuits give me more en­ergy when I’m work­ing long hours. They are easy to reach for.”</p>
    <p>Her habits have caused her to gain 4kg to 6kg re­cently. She stands at 1.55m and weighs 78kg.</p>
    <p>Like Ms Ng, more peo­ple here are overeat­ing or even binge eat­ing to cope with in­creased stress dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic. Four hos­pi­tals and clin­ics The Straits Times checked with all saw a rise in such cases.</p>
    <p>Mr Henry Lew, a se­nior psy­chol­o­gist at Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal’s de­part­ment of psy­chol­ogy, said pa­tients are find­ing it harder to man­age their binge-eat­ing ten­den­cies dur­ing this pe­riod.</p>
    <p>This could be due to var­i­ous stres­sors brought about by the pan­demic in­clud­ing in­creased work­load, re­trench­ment and longer work hours at home, as well as a surge in the avail­abil­ity of food de­liv­ery op­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Lew said stress from work and in­ter­per­sonal sit­u­a­tions can over­whelm in­di­vid­u­als and cause neg­a­tive emo­tions, which may lead to them binge eat­ing to dis­tract and soothe them­selves.</p>
    <p>“The in­crease in stress and anx­i­ety may cause peo­ple to turn to food, which is the fastest and most con­ve­nient way (to de­stress). Fur­ther­more, some in­di­vid­u­als stock up on food and these are easy stim­u­lants to trig­ger eat­ing to cope with stress,” he added.</p>
    <p>Dr Cheah Ming Hann, a fam­ily physi­cian at Jurong Poly­clinic, also noted that some pa­tients are hav­ing a more dif­fi­cult time con­trol­ling their diet as they lead a se­den­tary life­style dur­ing this pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“This could be due to con­cerns about ex­er­cis­ing out­doors, snack­ing more while stay­ing at home and stress-eat­ing due to a change in their fi­nan­cial sit­u­a­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>Prom­ises Health­care, a multi-dis­ci­plinary clinic with a fo­cus on spe­cial­ist care in men­tal health and ad­dic­tions, has seen an in­crease in clients with a binge-eat­ing prob­lem since the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>The clinic’s di­rec­tor of ad­dic­tion ser­vices, Mr Andy Leach, said binge eat­ing pro­vides a tem­po­rary es­cape from the prob­lem a per­son is fac­ing and is a way of “try­ing to avoid un­com­fort­able feel­ings”.</p>
    <p>Ms Toh Hui Moon, a clin­i­cal psy­chol­o­gist at the Na­tional Univer­sity Poly­clin­ics, said an in­di­vid­ual’s sur­vival mech­a­nism known as the fight-or-flight re­sponse is trig­gered in a stress­ful sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The sym­pa­thetic ner­vous sys­tem in the body is then ac­ti­vated, caus­ing a surge of ep­i­neph­rine, also re­ferred to as adren­a­line.</p>
    <p>Ex­plained Ms Toh: “This hor­mone shuts down our di­ges­tion sys­tem and re­duces our ap­petite. How­ever, if stress per­sists, our bod­ies pro­duce an­other hor­mone known as cor­ti­sol.</p>
    <p>“Cor­ti­sol in­creases our ap­petite and our mo­ti­va­tion as well, in­clud­ing the mo­ti­va­tion to eat, which may lead to overeat­ing be­hav­iours.”</p>
    <p>Ms Holly Wolver­ton, an in­ten­tional eat­ing health coach, has seen a 20 to 30 per cent in­crease in binge eat­ing cases since April.</p>
    <p>The 30-year-old Sin­ga­porean, who is in a re­la­tion­ship, had her­self turned to binge eat­ing when she started a job in sales four years ago.</p>
    <p>There was a lot of pres­sure to per­form and her lack of in­ter­est in the job made her feel trapped, she said.</p>
    <p>She of­ten had ten­sion headaches and felt pan­icked. To feel bet­ter, she of­ten ate large amounts of food to the point of dis­com­fort.</p>
    <p>She said: “I’d some­times start eat­ing one cookie or one chip, which would evoke some­thing in­side of me, and I’d sud­denly have the urge to have 20 more serv­ings till I felt so phys­i­cally sick and very, very full.</p>
    <p>“It dis­tracted me from the work and stress.”</p>
    <p>Ms Wolver­ton said she had spent hun­dreds of dol­lars on food in one sit­ting. She would eat high-calo­rie and highly pro­cessed foods such as cook­ies, potato chips, muffins, dough­nuts and fried chicken dur­ing her binge-eat­ing episodes.</p>
    <p>Apart from gain­ing 10kg in three months, her binge eat­ing made her feel “trapped and de­pressed”.</p>
    <p>She broke out of her ad­dic­tion one year ago through re­cov­ery prac­tices such as med­i­ta­tion, ex­er­cise and work­ing with a health coach.</p>
    <p>Psy­chol­o­gist Ms Toh notes that stress has been shown to af­fect the type of food choices an in­di­vid­ual makes. Stud­ies have found that stress in­creases the in­take of food that is high in fat and su­gar.</p>
    <p>“Food high in fat or su­gar does re­duce stress-re­lated re­sponses and emo­tions. This could lead to ha­bit­ual crav­ings for these types of food when­ever we are stressed,” she said.</p>
    <p>While a lit­tle weight gain may not sound alarm­ing, an in­creased in­take in fatty or sug­ary food can be prob­lem­atic for those with chronic ill­nesses such as di­a­betes.</p>
    <p>Said Dr Cheah: “It’s im­por­tant to main­tain good di­etary habits par­tic­u­larly for pa­tients with di­a­betes, as pe­ri­ods of poor glycemic con­trol could in­crease the risk of de­vel­op­ing com­pli­ca­tions such as kid­ney fail­ure, blind­ness, stroke or heart at­tack.”</p>
    <p>The weight of a pa­tient and weightre­lated con­di­tions such as di­a­betes and high choles­terol could point to binge eat­ing.</p>
    <p>Treat­ment usu­ally con­sists of both psy­chi­atric med­i­ca­tion and psy­cho­log­i­cal treat­ment.</p>
    <p>Ms Lynette Goh, a prin­ci­pal di­eti­tian at the Na­tional Univer­sity Poly­clin­ics, ad­vised in­di­vid­u­als to prac­tise mind­ful eat­ing by be­ing aware of the types of food con­sumed as well as how the food is pre­pared.</p>
    <p>She urged peo­ple to eat a range of fruit and veg­eta­bles that rep­re­sent the dif­fer­ent colours of the rain­bow and to fill their meals with whole grains and high pro­tein foods.</p>
    <p>She said: “When you start fill­ing up on whole foods, you won’t have room for the high-fat or sug­ary tid­bits.”</p>
    <p>Ms Goh added that peo­ple should avoid temp­ta­tions such as work­ing near the kitchen if work­ing from home, or keep­ing snacks at the desk in the of­fice.</p>
    <p>She said: “It will be much harder to re­sist temp­ta­tion if you are work­ing where food is within reach and sight. Work­ing in a dif­fer­ent place, away from food, will help you win half the bat­tle.”</p>
