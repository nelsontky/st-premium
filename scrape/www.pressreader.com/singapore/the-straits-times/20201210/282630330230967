    <p>Christ­mas per­for­mances are usu­ally aplenty this time of year – or at least, this was the case be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But some arts groups, from theatre com­pany Dream Academy to the Sin­ga­pore Sym­phony Or­ches­tra (SSO), are sol­dier­ing on with their Christ­mas con­certs de­spite strict safe-dis­tanc­ing mea­sures. In a pan­demic year, they say, funds and fes­tive spirit are all the more vi­tal.</p>
    <p>For Dream Academy, it is a huge re­lief to fi­nally stage its first live con­cert this year.</p>
    <p>The Crazy Christ­mas con­cert, a Dream Academy tra­di­tion, will be held from next Tues­day to Dec 20, fea­tures iconic trio The Dim Sum Dol­lies. Ac­tress and play­wright Jo Tan joins Selena Tan and Pam Oei in her first Crazy Christ­mas con­cert.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily-friendly con­cert will also fea­ture co­me­di­ans such as Ku­mar and Se­bas­tian Tan in his Broad­way Beng per­sona.</p>
    <p>The gig was ini­tially planned for a max­i­mum au­di­ence size of 100, but Dream Academy’s ap­pli­ca­tion to be part of a Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try pi­lot scheme, which will al­low 250 at­ten­dees, was ap­proved on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Dream Academy founding artis­tic di­rec­tor Selena Tan says: “When it was ini­tially an­nounced that the­atres could be opened to up to 100 peo­ple, we jumped at this chance. Our heart is re­ally in live per­for­mances and even if only 100 peo­ple could be in the theatre, we wanted to make it hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany, like many oth­ers, was hit hard dur­ing the pan­demic, with zero box-of­fice sales for months.</p>
    <p>Plans for a full year of ac­tiv­i­ties to cel­e­brate its 20th an­niver­sary came to nought.</p>
    <p>“We were go­ing to start with a big Ku­mar show and had al­most sold out the tick­ets,” says Tan. “But then came the cir­cuit breaker. That killed us in many ways – not just in fi­nances, but in spirit too.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany ended up hav­ing to can­cel the con­cert and con­tact 3,500 pa­trons to give them the op­tion of either get­ting a re­fund or ex­chang­ing their tick­ets for a 30-minute video record­ing of Ku­mar’s show.</p>
    <p>While Tan ad­mits that it has been very tough on the fi­nances to stage the Crazy Christ­mas con­cert, she be­lieves the show means “so much more than the money”.</p>
    <p>She says: “This show was born out of ne­ces­sity, grit, a sense of re­silience and the feel­ing that we have to push on and be strong. We have been hit hard, but we in­tend to stay here.”</p>
    <p>The SSO hopes its Christ­mas fund-rais­ing con­cert at the Es­planade next Tues­day and Wed­nes­day will ad­dress its “im­me­di­ate fund­ing needs” as a re­sult of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>SSO chief ex­ec­u­tive Chng Hak-Peng says the or­ches­tra has had to pivot from live con­certs to stream­ing an on­line sea­son to home view­ers. “This was no sim­ple task. It in­volved sourc­ing and buy­ing equip­ment, learn­ing and im­pro­vis­ing dig­i­tal skills and cu­rat­ing a so­cial me­dia sea­son that was en­ter­tain­ing and en­light­en­ing.”</p>
    <p>He es­ti­mates the in­cre­men­tal cost of pro­duc­ing each dig­i­tal con­cert is ap­prox­i­mately $25,000.</p>
    <p>The up­com­ing con­cert, which will have an au­di­ence of 400 each night, will be part of an on­go­ing pi­lot with manda­tory pre-event Anti­gen Rapid Tests for at­ten­dees of large-scale in­door live per­for­mances. The tests will be pro­vided for free to au­di­ence mem­bers, who must get swabbed within 24 hours be­fore the end of the con­cert.</p>
    <p>The Christ­mas con­cert will fea­ture pieces new to the or­ches­tra, such as Marc-An­toine Char­p­en­tier’s Carol For In­stru­ments and Francesco Man­fre­dini’s Christ­mas Con­certo.</p>
    <p>SSO as­so­ciate con­duc­tor Joshua Tan, who has not con­ducted a live con­cert since March, says: “The or­ches­tra is ex­cited to per­form with an au­di­ence. With­out an au­di­ence, it’s like ath­letes play­ing in an empty sta­dium.</p>
    <p>“A lot of peo­ple find refuge in mu­sic when the go­ing gets tough. Mu­sic is es­sen­tial for the hu­man soul.”</p>
