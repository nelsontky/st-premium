    <p>Two sis­ters were con­tent to let “sleep­ing dogs lie” af­ter they dis­cov­ered that their brother had used funds from the fam­ily busi­ness for his own fam­ily’s ex­penses.</p>
    <p>How­ever, they de­cided to bring the mat­ter to light af­ter his son, on his be­half, de­cided to sue them and their late mother’s es­tate over debts owed by the busi­ness to a bank.</p>
    <p>The High Court has dis­missed the law­suit against Ms Lee Gin Hong and Ms Lee Gim Moi, hold­ing that their brother, Mr Lee Ker Min, ought to ac­count for sums he had with­drawn for his per­sonal use.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the judg­ment dated last Thurs­day, the sib­lings’ fa­ther – Mr Lee Kim Eng – started Lee Huat Com­pany in 1958.</p>
    <p>The busi­ness, which is a re­tailer of mo­tor­cy­cles, mo­tor scoot­ers and re­lated ac­ces­sories as well as a work­shop, op­er­ates at a shop­house in Up­per Bukit Timah Road.</p>
    <p>In 1975, the younger Mr Lee was ap­pointed a part­ner in the busi­ness. His mother, Madam Ng Ang Chum, was also reg­is­tered as a part­ner af­ter the el­der Mr Lee died in 1981.</p>
    <p>In July 2014, Mr Lee Ker Min suf­fered a stroke that in­ca­pac­i­tated him, and the busi­ness was sub­se­quently man­aged by his se­cond son, Mr Jef­frey Lee Kai Leong.</p>
    <p>Madam Ng died in De­cem­ber that year, and her daugh­ters – Ms Lee Gin Hong and Ms Lee Gim Moi – be­came ex­ecu­tors of her es­tate.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions later arose be­tween the sis­ters and their brother’s fam­ily over the re­pay­ment of the part­ner­ship’s over­draft fa­cil­ity with United Overseas Bank ob­tained in 2000.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee sued his sis­ters through his el­dest son, Mr Roland Lee Kai Teck, seek­ing a dec­la­ra­tion from the court that the part­ner­ship had a debt of $740,214 to the bank at the time of Madam Ng’s death and that his sis­ters had to pay half of it as ex­ecu­tors of their mother’s es­tate.</p>
    <p>Among other claims, he said his sis­ters had acted in bad faith in ad­min­is­ter­ing their mother’s es­tate.</p>
    <p>Mr Roland Lee said in an af­fi­davit that Madam Ng was an “ex­tremely smart woman” and “well versed” with every as­pect of the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Mr Roland Lee also said Madam Ng re­tained con­trol of the busi­ness af­ter his fa­ther suf­fered a stroke, with his aunts run­ning it and in­struct­ing Mr Jef­frey Lee.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, the sis­ters, in their tes­ti­mony, said Madam Ng was il­lit­er­ate, never re­ceived any prof­its from the busi­ness while she was a part­ner, and did not take part in run­ning the busi­ness. Their brother had man­aged the busi­ness on his own un­til his stroke, af­ter which Mr Jef­frey Lee took over, they added.</p>
    <p>They also said their brother had used large sums – to­talling al­most $2.6 mil­lion – from the part­ner­ship’s funds, such as the over­draft fa­cil­ity and its other bank ac­counts, for his per­sonal ex­penses such as the pur­chase of sev­eral prop­er­ties and in­vest­ment in other busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Judge Lai Siu Chiu said in her judg­ment that the money taken by Mr Lee is a debt owed to Madam Ng, and there­fore to her es­tate. Un­til the debt is set­tled and re­paid, Madam Ng’s es­tate is not obliged to re­pay half of the busi­ness’ debt to the bank, the judge said.</p>
    <p>She said the sis­ters could choose to ap­ply for an in­quiry to trace and re­cover the money that Mr Lee had with­drawn from the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Judge Lai said it was ab­surd for Mr Lee to have re­fused to ad­mit that Madam Ng was il­lit­er­ate when one of his own wit­nesses had al­ready stated this was so.</p>
    <p>“The court finds it dis­grace­ful and de­plorable that the plain­tiff’s sons/fam­ily have cho­sen to sue their pa­ter­nal aunts and their grand­mother’s es­tate af­ter the plain­tiff was in­ca­pac­i­tated by a stroke and at the same time, refuse to re­pay or ac­count for all/any of the monies the plain­tiff took from the part­ner­ship,” she added.</p>
