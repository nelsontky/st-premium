    <p>• The United States econ­omy con­tracted at an an­nual rate of 31.4 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter amid a mount­ing Covid-19 fall­out.</p>
    <p>This is 0.3 per­cent­age point higher than the pre­vi­ous es­ti­mate in late Au­gust, the US Com­merce Depart­ment said in its third and fi­nal es­ti­mate re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The up­ward re­vi­sion with the lat­est es­ti­mate pri­mar­ily re­flected an up­ward re­vi­sion to per­sonal con­sump­tion ex­pen­di­tures (PCE) that was partly off­set by down­ward re­vi­sions to ex­ports and to non-res­i­den­tial fixed in­vest­ment, ac­cord­ing to the depart­ment’s Bureau of Eco­nomic Anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>The de­crease in real gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) in the sec­ond quar­ter re­flected de­creases in PCE, ex­ports, non-res­i­den­tial fixed in­vest­ment, pri­vate in­ven­tory in­vest­ment, res­i­den­tial fixed in­vest­ment, and state and lo­cal gov­ern­ment spend­ing that were partly off­set by an in­crease in fed­eral gov­ern­ment spend­ing, the re­port showed.</p>
    <p>The ad­vance es­ti­mate of GDP re­leased in late July showed that the US econ­omy con­tracted at an an­nual rate of 32.9 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>In the first quar­ter of this year, US real GDP shrank at an an­nual rate of 5 per cent. As busi­nesses have re­opened and mil­lions of jobs have been re­gained, econ­o­mists be­lieve that the US econ­omy will re­bound in the third quar­ter, while not­ing that more fis­cal relief is needed to sus­tain the eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>“While the econ­omy has been do­ing bet­ter than ex­pected, I think there’s down­side risk to that if there is no fur­ther fis­cal sup­port,” US Fed­eral Re­serve chair­man Jerome Pow­ell said re­cently, at a hear­ing be­fore the Se­nate Bank­ing Com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral bank chief noted both em­ploy­ment and overall eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity re­main well below their pre-pan­demic lev­els, and the coun­try still has 11 mil­lion un­em­ployed, out of the 22 mil­lion who were laid off in March and April amid Covid-19 shut­downs.</p>
    <p>The me­dian pro­jec­tion for the un­em­ploy­ment rate is 7.6 per cent at the end of this year, and 4 per cent by the end of 2023, ac­cord­ing to the Fed­eral Re­serve’s lat­est eco­nomic pro­jec­tions.</p>
    <p>This is still above the his­toric low of 3.5 per cent the coun­try ex­pe­ri­enced be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Demo­cratic and Repub­li­can law­mak­ers re­main dead­locked on the next round of relief roughly two months af­ter the ex­tra US$600 (S$820) per week fed­eral un­em­ploy­ment bene­fits – part of a US$2 tril­lion relief pack­age ap­proved by Congress in late March – ex­pired at the end of July.</p>
    <p>Amid grow­ing doubts about the two sides’ will­ing­ness and abil­ity to break the im­passe, US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steven Mnuchin re­sumed their talks ear­lier this week over a US$2.2 tril­lion relief pack­age newly pro­posed by House Democrats.</p>
