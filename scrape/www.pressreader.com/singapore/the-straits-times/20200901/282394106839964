    <p>HONG KONG • Ant Group’s po­ten­tially record-size ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO) could pro­pel tech­nol­ogy cap­i­tal rais­ing this year past the dizzy­ing heights of the dot.com bub­ble, an ex­tra­or­di­nary show­ing in a pan­demic-stricken year fraught with geopo­lit­i­cal un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>Mr Jack Ma’s Chi­nese fi­nan­cial ti­tan aims to raise at least US$30 bil­lion (S$41 bil­lion) i n Hong Kong and Shang­hai next month, which could push global first­time share sales by tech firms well past US$57 bil­lion, ac­cord­ing to Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>That would be the high­est since 1999, when tech com­pa­nies raised US$62 bil­lion and fa­mously ush­ered in a plethora of now-de­funct In­ter­net out­fits.</p>
    <p>Af­ter an ini­tial pan­demic-in­duced lull, cor­po­rate share sales have come back with a vengeance, lur­ing many of the same in­vestors who pushed Ap­ple’s market cap past the US$2 tril­lion mark and ig­nited a broad rally in In­ter­net com­pa­nies world­wide.</p>
    <p>Ant joins a stam­pede of com­pa­nies that be­gan try­ing to sell shares re­cently, from food de­liv­ery be­he­moth DoorDash to Airbnb.</p>
    <p>July’s al­most US$19 bil­lion in new list­ings was the busiest month for United States IPOs since September 2014, when 36 com­pa­nies in­clud­ing Ant-af­fil­i­ate Alibaba Group went pub­lic while rais­ing US$36 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>“The multiple en­vi­ron­ment for tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies is at the high­est since the dot.com bub­ble,” said Ms Lauren Cum­mings, Mor­gan Stan­ley’s co-head of tech­nol­ogy eq­uity cap­i­tal mar­kets for the Amer­i­cas.</p>
    <p>“2020 is the year a lot of com­pa­nies are go­ing pub­lic but there are still many high-qual­ity com­pa­nies, prob­a­bly multiple times of what we have this year, that are qual­ity com­pa­nies, that are scaled, that can go pub­lic next year.”</p>
    <p>In­vestors have ques­tioned whether a 2020 run-up that has lifted mar­quee names from Ap­ple to Face­book to Ten­cent is fu­elling a bub­ble akin to that of two decades ago, which brought down much of the fledg­ling In­ter­net econ­omy when it popped.</p>
    <p>Be­yond the fun­da­men­tals, how­ever, there are sev­eral unique as­pects to this year’s tech ma­nia. One is sheer size. Ant’s gi­ant of­fer­ing may skew com­par­isons with 1999, par­tic­u­larly if it sur­passes Saudi Aramco’s US$29 bil­lion IPO last year as the largest in his­tory.</p>
    <p>The past year has fea­tured an un­usual num­ber of first-time share sales on Hong Kong or main­land bourses by Chi­nese com­pa­nies al­ready listed abroad, fear­ing a back­lash from an in­creas­ingly bel­liger­ent Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion. They in­clude Alibaba, JD.com and top chip­maker Semi­con­duc­tor Man­u­fac­tur­ing In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>The rise of the hy­per-lo­cal ChiNext and Star mar­kets in China has also in­flated this year’s pipe­line. Punters on the main­land have gob­bled up loss-mak­ing debu­tantes like never be­fore – trig­ger­ing first-day ral­lies of over 2,000 per cent in some cases – partly be­cause they be­lieve Bei­jing will of­fer fi­nan­cial and other forms of aid for a Chi­nese tech sec­tor seen as es­sen­tial given the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s curbs on trade.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, the un­known ex­tent of the global eco­nomic down­turn caused by the pan­demic has led some com­pa­nies to re­think their cap­i­tal needs or speed up plans.</p>
    <p>Airbnb, which was pre­vi­ously seen as a can­di­date for a di­rect list­ing, said last month it filed for a tra­di­tional IPO. Last week, on Mon­day alone, four bio­med­i­cal com­pa­nies, four blank-cheque com­pa­nies and five soft­ware com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing Unity Soft­ware, filed to go pub­lic.</p>
    <p>“The year has been re­ally busy for eq­uity cap­i­tal mar­kets deals so far de­spite all the head­line news,” said Bank of Amer­ica co-head of eq­uity cap­i­tal mar­kets for Asia-Pa­cific Tucker High­field.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pect to see strong IPO mar­kets to the end of year as in­vestors con­tinue to look for higher re­turns.”</p>
