    <p>• More than two decades of ef­forts by Mi­crosoft to put down roots in China may soon bring a par­tial pay­off, if it suc­ceeds in steer­ing through the pur­chase of TikTok’s United States busi­ness.</p>
    <p>But as re­la­tions be­tween the US and China con­tinue to de­te­ri­o­rate, the soft­ware com­pany’s long-term bet on the Chi­nese mar­ket is also fac­ing its most un­cer­tain pe­riod yet.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft’s in­volve­ment in the Chi­nese tech world, dat­ing from its cre­ation of a re­search cen­tre in Bei­jing in the late 1990s, has left it with im­por­tant per­sonal con­nec­tions. Mr Zhang Yim­ing, the founder of ByteDance, the com­pany that owns TikTok, worked at Mi­crosoft, though only for a few months be­fore he left to join a start-up.</p>
    <p>That was not un­usual at the time: Mi­crosoft’s re­search lab was known within China as an in­cu­ba­tor for en­trepreneur­s in the late 1990s and 2000s, who then went on to pro­pel the coun­try’s tech ex­plo­sion. The com­pany has nur­tured much tal­ent – from fa­cial recog­ni­tion gi­ant Megvii founder</p>
    <p>Yin Qi to mo­bile phone maker Xiaomi’s co-founder Lin Bin.</p>
    <p>Back then the free­dom and global plat­form that Mi­crosoft of­fered for cut­ting-edge com­puter science re­search was un­prece­dented in China. Mi­crosoft Re­search had the pick of the coun­try’s best PhD grad­u­ates.</p>
    <p>“All the pre-ex­ist­ing con­nec­tions be­tween ByteDance and Mi­crosoft meant there were lines of trusted com­mu­ni­ca­tions that could be taken ad­van­tage of,” said a for­mer Mi­crosoft China ex­ec­u­tive, who added that Mr Zhang was close friends with for­mer Mi­crosoft vice-pres­i­dent Harry Shum, whose pro­tege Ma Wei-Ying was head of ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence at ByteDance un­til last month.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft also worked on build­ing con­nec­tions with China’s po­lit­i­cal elite. The com­pany’s founder Bill Gates was one of the few for­eign ex­ec­u­tives to meet three Chi­nese pres­i­dents in a row, be­gin­ning in 1995, around the time Mi­crosoft en­tered China.</p>
    <p>Five years ago Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping vis­ited Mi­crosoft’s head­quar­ters in Red­mond, Wash­ing­ton, where he praised the com­pany for “driv­ing for­ward the de­vel­op­ment of China’s ICT (in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy) in­dus­try”.</p>
