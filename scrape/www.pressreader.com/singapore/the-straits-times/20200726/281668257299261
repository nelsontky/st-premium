    <p>SYD­NEY/LON­DON • Al­most 40 coun­tries have re­ported record sin­gle­day in­creases in coro­n­avirus cases over the past week, around dou­ble the num­ber that did so the pre­vi­ous week, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally show­ing a spike in the Covid-19 pan­demic in ev­ery re­gion of the world.</p>
    <p>The rate of cases has been in­creas­ing not only in ar­eas like the United States, Brazil and In­dia, which have dom­i­nated head­lines with large out­breaks, but also in Aus­tralia, Ja­pan, Hong Kong, Bo­livia, Su­dan, Ethiopia, Bul­garia, Bel­gium, Uzbek­istan and Is­rael, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Many coun­tries, es­pe­cially those where of­fi­cials eased ear­lier so­cial dis­tanc­ing lock­downs, are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a sec­ond peak more than a month af­ter record­ing their first.</p>
    <p>“We will not be go­ing back to the ‘old nor­mal’. The pan­demic has al­ready changed the way we live our lives,” World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) di­rec­tor-gen­eral Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus said last week.</p>
    <p>“We’re ask­ing ev­ery­one to treat the de­ci­sions about where they go, what they do and who they meet with as life-and-death de­ci­sions – be­cause they are.”</p>
    <p>The Reuters data, com­piled from of­fi­cial re­ports, shows a steady rise in the num­ber of coun­tries re­port­ing record daily in­creases in coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>At least seven coun­tries recorded such in­creases four weeks ago, ris­ing to at least 13 three weeks ago, to at least 20 two weeks ago and to 37 coun­tries last week.</p>
    <p>The true num­bers of both cases and deaths are al­most cer­tainly un­der-re­ported, par­tic­u­larly in coun­tries with poorer health­care sys­tems, ex­perts and of­fi­cials say. For this re­port, the Reuters data was re­stricted to coun­tries that pro­vide reg­u­lar daily num­bers. A surge in cases usu­ally pre­cedes a rise in deaths by a cou­ple of weeks.</p>
    <p>The Reuters tally comes as the WHO re­ported a record in­crease in global coro­n­avirus cases on Fri­day, with the to­tal ris­ing by 284,196 in 24 hours. The pre­vi­ous WHO record for new cases was 259,848 on July 18.</p>
    <p>Deaths rose by 9,753, the big­gest one-day in­crease since a record high of 9,797 deaths on April 30. Fa­tal­i­ties have av­er­aged 5,000 a day so far this month, up from an av­er­age of 4,600 a day last month.</p>
    <p>The US re­mains at the top of the case list, last week pass­ing more than four mil­lion cases and record­ing more than 1,000 deaths for four con­sec­u­tive days.</p>
    <p>Early June was the last time the US recorded over 1,000 deaths a day for four days in a row, re­sult­ing from fall­out from in­fec­tions in April.</p>
    <p>US deaths rose by at least 1,019 to to­tal 145,352 on Fri­day com­pared with a rise of 1,140 on Thurs­day, 1,135 on Wed­nes­day and 1,141 on Tues­day. To­tal cases across the US rose by at least 68,800 on Fri­day to over four mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Even though deaths are ris­ing in the US for a sec­ond week in a row, they re­main well be­low lev­els seen in April, when 2,000 peo­ple a day on av­er­age died from the virus.</p>
    <p>Brazil and In­dia – which epi­demi­ol­o­gists say is still likely months from hit­ting their peaks – have also ex­ceeded one mil­lion cases.</p>
    <p>The data re­veals a grow­ing num­ber of resur­gent cases in coun­tries across all re­gions.</p>
    <p>In Aus­tralia, of­fi­cials en­forced a six-week par­tial lock­down and made face masks manda­tory for res­i­dents in the coun­try’s sec­ond­largest city, Mel­bourne, af­ter a fresh out­break.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia and Ja­pan, which also posted a daily case record last week, both warned of a rise in in­fec­tions among young peo­ple, many of whom cel­e­brated the end of so­cial</p>
