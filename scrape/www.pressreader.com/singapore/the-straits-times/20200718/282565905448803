    <p>• Manch­ester City have beaten Ar­se­nal in their past seven meet­ings in all com­pe­ti­tions, scor­ing at least three times in six of those en­coun­ters.</p>
    <p>And hav­ing met last month at the Eti­had, where Pep Guardi­ola’s side swat­ted aside the Gun­ners 3-0 to kick off the restart of the Pre­mier League, many pun­dits have dis­missed the chance of an up­set in their FA Cup semi-fi­nal to­day.</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard, how­ever, does not be­lieve it will be a fore­gone con­clu­sion at Wem­b­ley.</p>
    <p>Asked at his vir­tual pre-match press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day if City would win eas­ily, he said: “They (the crit­ics) are wrong.”</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola has faced his pro­tege Mikel Arteta only once since he left for the Emi­rates in De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>But, while Ar­se­nal look set to miss out on Euro­pean foot­ball for the first time since the 1995-96 sea­son un­less they can lift the Cup, the City man­ager has seen enough since the ap­point­ment of his for­mer as­sis­tant to know the Gun­ners pose a threat to his side’s chances of a sec­ond tro­phy this term.</p>
    <p>“I ex­pect a tough, tough game. They have some­thing spe­cial with Mikel,” Guardi­ola said. “They have team spirit – how they cel­e­brate goals, how they fight for ev­ery ball.</p>
    <p>“They have started to cre­ate some­thing spe­cial. We ap­proach Ar­se­nal the same as ev­ery other game.</p>
    <p>“I’m sure the right per­son to bring them back to the po­si­tion be­fore is Mikel – there is no bet­ter per­son. I have a feel­ing he is cre­at­ing some­thing unique. If he gets sup­port from the club, they will be con­tenders.”</p>
    <p>Re­tain­ing the Cup is a pri­or­ity for City, who can still end the sea­son with their sec­ond suc­ces­sive tre­ble. As such, Guardi­ola con­firmed he would be play­ing his strong­est pos­si­ble side, with Clau­dio Bravo, their usual Cup goal­keeper, re­placed by No. 1 Ed­er­son.</p>
    <p>“We are one step closer to get­ting to an­other fi­nal and we are go­ing to try and do a good game – the FA Cup semi-fi­nal is so im­por­tant.”</p>
    <p>Three years un­der Guardi­ola means that Arteta is fully aware of the dan­gers of a free-flow­ing City.</p>
    <p>The record 13-time Cup win­ners, have, how­ever, been buoyed by the 2-1 win over Liver­pool on Wed­nes­day. Arteta fore­sees a sim­i­lar game to­day and, with lit­tle of the ball ex­pected, he called on his team to take their chances.</p>
    <p>He said at his vir­tual pre-match press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day: “We can­not ex­pect to be dom­i­nant for 90 min­utes and I don’t want to be de­fend­ing deep for 90 min­utes.</p>
    <p>“We’ll have our mo­ments as well and you know how cru­cial it is in big games... to make it al­ways good and make the right de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>“The level of dif­fi­culty will again be re­ally, re­ally high.”</p>
