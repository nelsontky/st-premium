    <p>1 All The Es­sen­tially Es­sen­tial (above) by Tan Wee Lit</p>
    <p>Cen­tral Busi­ness Dis­trict dwellers must have spot­ted this large-scale, stain­less-steel work lo­cated right out­side Raf­fles Place MRT sta­tion’s en­trance.</p>
    <p>The sculp­ture, orig­i­nally con­ceived for in­stal­la­tion at East Coast Park in 2013, con­sists of a large rec­tan­gu­lar frame with an ar­ray of ev­ery­day items sus­pended within the frame.</p>
    <p>Tan, the artist be­hind the work, says: “It con­sists of ev­ery­thing you would need for a day at the beach – from the pic­nic bas­ket to the yoga mat.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter re­lo­cat­ing (the sculp­ture to Raf­fles Place), I went on to in­clude a cou­ple more items that are re­flec­tive of work­ing life – al­lud­ing to the fact that one can still think about work even when one is out there at the beach.”</p>
    <p>Tan, 42, who teaches vis­ual arts at the School of the Arts Sin­ga­pore (Sota), also ex­plains the large gap on one side of his work. “The gap left in the sculp­ture is for two peo­ple to com­plete the work phys­i­cally. Af­ter all, you can have ev­ery­thing you need but it is still the com­pany you have that mat­ters.”</p>
    <p>2 Doggo & Kitty Cat (above) by Belinda Gan</p>
    <p>The Bugis-Bras Basah arts dis­trict is made even more colour­ful by Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (Nafa) alumna Belinda Gan’s sculp­tures, cre­ated in 2017.</p>
    <p>Lo­cated right out­side Nafa, the cute, car­toon­ish sculp­tures of two dogs and a cat dou­ble as benches for the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Gan’s benches, aimed at en­liven­ing Ben­coolen Street, por­tray how pets be­have.</p>
    <p>Her two dogs look as if they are sniff­ing each other with their pointed noses, while the cat is on its back, look­ing for a belly rub.</p>
    <p>3 Jelly Baby Fam­ily (right) by Mauro Peruc­chetti</p>
    <p>The colour­ful resin sculp­ture of jelly bean-like fig­ures out­side Plaza Sin­ga­pura is a fun de­vi­a­tion from the or­di­nary.</p>
    <p>Made in 2012 by Ital­ian artist Mauro Peruc­chetti, these larger-than-life fig­ures seem to ob­serve passers-by in a mild man­ner.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Art@Cap­i­ta­land, the Jelly Baby Fam­ily se­ries is rooted in Peruc­chetti’s in­ter­est in cloning hu­man be­ings.</p>
    <p>He later moved away from that con­cept and cur­rently sees the Jelly Ba­bies, with their child­like in­no­cence, as an em­bod­i­ment of the pre­cious­ness of fam­ily unity and the mul­ti­cul­tural as­pect of mod­ern so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>4 Disco (left) by Phunk Stu­dio</p>
    <p>The glitz and glam­our of down­town Sin­ga­pore is re­flected in a sus­pended pub­lic sculp­ture in­side Prom­e­nade MRT sta­tion, called Dreams In So­cial Cos­mic Odyssey (Disco) by con­tem­po­rary art and de­sign col­lec­tive Phunk Stu­dio.</p>
    <p>The large-scale work, in­stalled in 2010, is in the shape of mas­sive wa­ter droplets made from thou­sands of tiny re­flec­tive steel discs.</p>
    <p>“The art­work plays with the sta­tion’s sky­light to il­lu­mi­nate the space with glow­ing re­flec­tions of the light, cre­at­ing a kalei­do­scope of pat­terns on the sta­tion floors, walls and ceil­ings,” says Phunk co-founder Wil­liam Chan, 46.</p>
    <p>Asked about the work’s po­etic ti­tle, he says: “It’s sort of an acros­tic poem that forms the word ‘disco’.</p>
    <p>“The tex­ture of the work looks sim­i­lar to a mirror ball, so we thought it would be fun to call it Disco, but we didn’t want it to be too ob­vi­ous.”</p>
    <p>5 Sta­ple (left) by Zain­udin Sam­suri</p>
    <p>Com­muters at the Ubi train sta­tion on the Down­town line might have no­ticed a cu­ri­ous stain­less-steel in­stal­la­tion above the plat­form, which can be viewed at eye level from the stair­case land­ing.</p>
    <p>The geo­met­ric sculp­ture is, in fact, lo­cal artist Zain­udin Sam­suri’s in­ter­pre­ta­tion of a tapi­oca plant, which is called Ubi in Malay. It is a nod to the es­tate’s his­tory of cul­ti­vat­ing tapi­oca plants, which gave it the name Kam­pong Ubi.</p>
    <p>“The ti­tle, Sta­ple, is a ref­er­ence to how tapi­oca had re­placed rice as the sta­ple food dur­ing the Ja­panese Oc­cu­pa­tion of Sin­ga­pore,” says Zain­udin, 46, who teaches vis­ual arts at Sota.</p>
    <p>The form of the sculp­ture also has spe­cial sig­nif­i­cance. “The skele­tal sil­hou­ette of the roots rep­re­sents sol­i­dar­ity in Sin­ga­pore’s mul­tira­cial and mul­ti­cul­tural so­ci­ety,” he adds. It was in­stalled in 2017 when the sta­tion was opened.</p>
    <p>6 The Ex­plorer (above) by Ng Eng Teng</p>
    <p>Cre­ated by the late Cul­tural Medal­lion re­cip­i­ent Ng Eng Teng in 1999 to cel­e­brate the start of a new mil­len­nium, this pub­lic sculp­ture has been adding to Sin­ga­pore Art Mu­seum’s charm for more than 20 years.</p>
    <p>The work com­prises an ab­stract form re­sem­bling a voyage ship, stacked atop nu­mer­ous globes of vary­ing sizes and colours.</p>
    <p>The sculp­ture is made us­ing ci­ment fondu, stain­less steel and gold leaf.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the web­site of the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil’s Pub­lic Arts Trust, the sculp­ture rep­re­sents “a de­sire for in­ter­galac­tic ex­plo­ration”, with hopes for “Sin­ga­pore’s op­ti­mistic fu­ture and con­tin­ued progress”.</p>
    <p>7 24 hours In Sin­ga­pore (above) by Baet Yeok Kuan</p>
    <p>Rem­i­nis­cent of Chicago’s fa­mous Cloud Gate in­stal­la­tion by Bri­tish artist Anish Kapoor, Baet Yeok Kuan’s mes­meris­ing au­dio-vis­ual in­stal­la­tion has stood guard over the Asian Civil­i­sa­tions Mu­seum’s court­yard since 2015.</p>
    <p>The work com­prises five stain­less-steel spheres of vary­ing sizes, which act as wide-an­gle lenses re­flect­ing the sur­round­ings on their rounded sur­faces.</p>
    <p>Not only does it make for a cool photo op­por­tu­nity, but the work also acts as an au­dio time cap­sule.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a Na­tional Arts Coun­cil in­ter­view with the artist in 2016, the sculp­ture plays record­ings of ev­ery­day sounds of Sin­ga­pore – think pub­lic trans­port, wet mar­kets and cof­fee shops – which Baet says “can serve as a ref­er­ence in the fu­ture as to how peo­ple’s lives used to sound”.</p>
    <p>8 Homage To Newton (above) by Sal­vador Dali</p>
    <p>Fine-art en­thu­si­asts will be de­lighted to learn that an orig­i­nal sculp­ture by sur­re­al­ist artist Sal­vador Dali can be found near the banks of the Sin­ga­pore River.</p>
    <p>The nearly 4m-tall bronze sculp­ture cast in 1985 is an ab­stract rep­re­sen­ta­tion of Newton, com­plete with a small ball that hangs from his hand by a metal string, rep­re­sent­ing grav­ity.</p>
    <p>Two in­ter­est­ing fea­tures of the work are the hol­low torso of the fig­ure, in­side which an­other ball is sus­pended, and a hol­low face.</p>
    <p>The work’s plaque ex­plains these fea­tures:</p>
    <p>“Sal­vador Dali, one of the most im­por­tant sur­re­al­ist artists, takes the lib­erty to go even fur­ther in pay­ing homage to Newton by open­ing up the torso of the fig­ure and sus­pend­ing the heart to in­di­cate ‘Open Heart­ed­ness’.</p>
    <p>“The open head rep­re­sents an ‘open mind’. These are two nec­es­sary qual­i­ties for the discovery of im­por­tant nat­u­ral laws, as well as for the suc­cess of all hu­man en­deav­ours.”</p>
    <p>9 The Nat­u­ral His­tory Of Sin­ga­pore’s Myth­i­cal Botanic Crea­tures (left) by Artists Car­a­van</p>
    <p>At a cor­ner of King Al­bert Park train sta­tion is a set of three bronze sculp­tures – about 30cm tall – re­sem­bling lit­tle in­sects.</p>
    <p>Cre­ated by an art col­lec­tive called Artists Car­a­van in 2015, the work was made in col­lab­o­ra­tion with stu­dents from Methodist Girls’ School, who picked up in­ter­est­ing flow­ers, seeds and leaves in Bukit Timah Na­ture Re­serve.</p>
    <p>They were told to re­search the plants they had col­lected.</p>
    <p>The mem­bers of Artists Car­a­van – Joey Soh, Chan Mei Hsien and Long Ying­han – then de­signed an­i­mated in­sect-like char­ac­ters in­spired by the flow­ers and leaves.</p>
    <p>“It was our idea of bring­ing na­ture into the sta­tion,” says Soh, art ed­u­ca­tor at Nafa and a prac­tis­ing artist, of the work. “Na­ture is al­ways around us, but we don’t re­ally no­tice it.”</p>
    <p>On the work’s pe­cu­liar ti­tle, she says: “We wanted to pre­tend to write them into Sin­ga­pore’s botan­i­cal his­tory as if the imag­i­nary in­sects had al­ways ex­isted and had just been dis­cov­ered.”</p>
    <p>10 Planet (left) by Marc Quinn</p>
    <p>Per­haps one of the best-known pub­lic sculp­tures in Sin­ga­pore is Planet by Bri­tish artist Marc Quinn at Gar­dens by the Bay.</p>
    <p>The colos­sal sculp­ture of a baby, mea­sur­ing 9m in length and 3m in height, is made even more re­mark­able by the way it is bal­anced.</p>
    <p>The only point of sup­port is the baby’s right hand, which gently touches the ground and gives the sculp­ture the il­lu­sion that it is weight­less.</p>
    <p>The art­work is a rep­re­sen­ta­tion of the artist’s son, Lu­cas, when he was an in­fant. Made of white-painted bronze and stain­less steel, it was in­stalled in 2013 as a per­ma­nent ex­hibit.</p>
