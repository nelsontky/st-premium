    <p>The con­cen­tra­tion of mi­grant work­ers in dor­mi­to­ries has been thinned out sig­nif­i­cantly, and large sec­tions of dorms are no longer gazetted as iso­la­tion ar­eas. Pur­pose-built dorms, the largest sites for hous­ing mi­grant work­ers, have seen a 25 per cent drop in oc­cu­pancy, said of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>The con­cen­tra­tion of mi­grant work­ers in dor­mi­to­ries has been thinned out sig­nif­i­cantly, and large sec­tions of dorms are no longer gazetted as iso­la­tion ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Pur­pose-built dorms, the largest sites for hous­ing mi­grant work­ers, have seen a 25 per cent drop in oc­cu­pancy.</p>
    <p>They now house some 160,000 work­ers, down from 212,000 in April, said the Man­power and Na­tional Devel­op­ment min­istries.</p>
    <p>In a joint re­ply to queries from The Straits Times, the min­istries said this is be­cause over the last few months, some work­ers have been moved out of their dor­mi­to­ries to other ac­com­mo­da­tion, such as gov­ern­ment tem­po­rary sites or new tem­po­rary liv­ing quar­ters.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said 71 blocks from 14 dorms are no longer deemed iso­la­tion ar­eas as of July 19, while 105 blocks in 22 dorms re­main gazetted.</p>
    <p>This means 40 per cent of 176 blocks in 25 dorms, ear­lier gazetted as iso­la­tion ar­eas, are no longer gazetted as such.</p>
    <p>Con­trols on the move­ments of mi­grant work­ers as well as pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures were strictly en­forced in th­ese iso­la­tion ar­eas to pre­vent the spread of the coro­n­avirus both within the dorms and to the wider com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>MOH said the degazetted dor­mi­tory blocks now house only re­cov­ered in­di­vid­u­als and those who re­cently tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Con­trol mea­sures are in place to pre­vent oc­cu­pants of th­ese blocks from min­gling with those in blocks that re­main gazetted as iso­la­tion ar­eas, it said.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, only work­ers stay­ing in the se­lected blocks are al­lowed to go to work, said MOH.</p>
    <p>They also still have to re­port their health sta­tus daily, stag­ger the use of com­mon fa­cil­i­ties and min­imise in­ter­ac­tions with oth­ers liv­ing in dif­fer­ent blocks.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to eval­u­ate the sit­u­a­tion in the dor­mi­to­ries, and more blocks will be pro­gres­sively re­moved from this list (of gazetted dorms) to house more re­cov­ered for­eign work­ers and those tested neg­a­tive in the com­ing weeks,” said MOH.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, co-chair­man of the multi-min­istry Covid-19 task force, had said last Satur­day that all dorms are ex­pected to be cleared of Covid-19 by Aug 7, apart from 17 blocks.</p>
    <p>Th­ese 17 blocks, which are in pur­pose-built dorms, are to serve as tem­po­rary quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties for work­ers still serv­ing their iso­la­tion pe­riod. They will house about 28,000.</p>
    <p>Work­ers who com­plete their iso­la­tion pe­riod will have to take an ad­di­tional Covid-19 test.</p>
    <p>Those who test neg­a­tive can re­sume work if their em­ploy­ers meet safety re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health said the degazetted dor­mi­tory blocks now house only re­cov­ered in­di­vid­u­als and those who re­cently tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19. Con­trol mea­sures are in place to pre­vent oc­cu­pants of th­ese blocks from min­gling with those in blocks that re­main gazetted as iso­la­tion ar­eas, it said.</p>
    <p>Apart from test­ing and clear­ing work­ers of Covid-19, three steps are man­dated by the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) to min­imise the risk of new in­fec­tion for any healthy worker to re­turn to work.</p>
    <p>The dorm op­er­a­tor must first ar­range stag­gered pick-up and drop-off times for work­ers with their em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers must also con­firm or up­date res­i­den­tial ad­dresses of staff on the MOM data­base.</p>
    <p>Work­ers them­selves must down­load the TraceTo­gether app to fa­cil­i­tate con­tact trac­ing, and the FWMOMCare mo­bile app to up­date their health sta­tus and res­i­dence. Th­ese de­tails must match their em­ployer’s and dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tor’s records.</p>
    <p>The work­ers also have to con­tinue to fol­low mea­sures that dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tors are re­quired to im­ple­ment, in­clud­ing wear­ing masks and prac­tis­ing safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
