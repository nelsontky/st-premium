    <p>He hails from Rus­sia’s south­ern Dages­tan re­gion, is un­de­feated in his pro­fes­sional mixed mar­tial arts (MMA) ca­reer, and could soon be headed to the Sin­ga­pore-based One Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>It is not MMA su­per­star Khabib Nur­magome­dov who is Onebound, though, but his cousin Us­man, who shares his sur­name.</p>
    <p>While Khabib, 31, is famed for be­ing the light­weight cham­pion of Amer­i­can MMA gi­ants the Ul­ti­mate Fight­ing Cham­pi­onship (UFC) and boasts a per­fect record of 28 wins, 20-year-old Us­man has been steadily chart­ing his own im­pres­sive course.</p>
    <p>Us­man moved to 10 wins from as many fights on July 31, with a 40-sec­ond tech­ni­cal knock­out win over Fin­nish fighter Jerry Kvarn­strom at the UAE War­riors 12 event in Abu Dhabi.</p>
    <p>Ac­claimed MMA man­ager Ali Ab­de­laziz, who man­ages both Khabib and Us­man, told The Straits Times in a phone in­ter­view yes­ter­day that the younger Nur­magome­dov could be One Cham­pi­onship-bound, and that they are “in ne­go­ti­a­tions” over a deal.</p>
    <p>One an­nounced a part­ner­ship with Ali’s man­age­ment com­pany, Dom­i­nance MMA, late last month.</p>
    <p>Ali, 42, an Egyp­tian and a former MMA fighter him­self, tipped Us­man for big things. Pre­vi­ously de­scrib­ing the young­ster in var­i­ous me­dia in­ter­views as “an ab­so­lute killer”, Ali told ST: “He’s still young. But by 25, he’ll be a bet­ter ver­sion of Khabib.”</p>
    <p>Time will tell if Us­man will sign for One and even­tu­ally em­u­late or even sur­pass his cousin, whose stock sky­rock­eted af­ter de­feat­ing Ir­ish MMA star Conor McGre­gor in Oc­to­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>But Ali and Dom­i­nance have wasted no time in mak­ing their pres­ence felt with One, hav­ing al­ready added two high-cal­i­bre fight­ers to the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s ros­ter.</p>
    <p>Dom­i­nance ath­letes Amir Ali­ak­bari, a 32-year-old Ira­nian Gre­coRo­man wrestling world cham­pion, and 30-year-old Brazil­ian jiu-jitsu (BJJ) spe­cial­ist Mar­cus “Buchecha” Almeida, who has won 13 ti­tles at the BJJ World Cham­pi­onships since 2012, were un­veiled as One fight­ers within the past week.</p>
    <p>While Ali be­lieves his clients have what it takes to win ti­tles in One, he added that sweep­ing up all on of­fer in One was “not his goal” and re­it­er­ated his de­light to be do­ing busi­ness with the Asian or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>When asked to en­cap­su­late what he thought of the part­ner­ship be­tween Dom­i­nance and One, Ali replied: “Great­ness.</p>
    <p>“I think this part­ner­ship will change the dy­namic of MMA in Asia, Europe and all over.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been watch­ing One for years, I’ve been a fan for years, and I like ev­ery­thing they do.</p>
    <p>“Cha­tri (Si­ty­o­d­tong, One founder and chair­man) is one of the big­gest pro­mot­ers in the world, and I may be the big­gest man­ager in the world.</p>
    <p>“I have great fight­ers, and if One is will­ing to make the right deals, why not have the best fight­ers in the world in One? It makes per­fect sense.”</p>
    <p>Cha­tri told ST: “They (Dom­i­nance MMA) have a great col­lec­tion of the world’s best mar­tial arts tal­ent and I am per­son­ally ex­cited to see their ath­letes in the One cir­cle very soon.</p>
    <p>“Our One Cham­pi­onship ath­letes are ready for the chal­lenge, and there are a hand­ful of in­ter­est­ing po­ten­tial matchups to be made.”</p>
