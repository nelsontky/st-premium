    <p>Lawyer Lana Sham­sud­din, 49, used to be a shopa­holic and would visit malls two or three times a week to shop and dine, but all that changed with the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Be­sides be­ing afraid of con­tract­ing the virus, Ms Lana, along with many oth­ers around the world, has been hit fi­nan­cially and has less spend­ing power than be­fore.</p>
    <p>“In the early days of the pan­demic, I was quite scared to go out. I am not so wor­ried now, but I still don’t go out as much be­cause I am strug­gling fi­nan­cially,” said the mother of two, whose monthly salary has been cut by 20 per cent since April.</p>
    <p>De­spite the un­cer­tain out­look for Malaysia’s re­tail in­dus­try due to the shrink­ing econ­omy, in­creased on­line shop­ping, closed bor­ders and a glut of re­tail space, more gi­ant glitzy malls are sprout­ing up and op­er­a­tors are up­beat about their prospects.</p>
    <p>One mall that is open­ing in 2022 is lo­cated in the Tun Razak Ex­change (TRX), a fi­nan­cial district that was for­mer premier Na­jib Razak’s pet project, and is Malaysia’s an­swer to Sin­ga­pore’s Ma­rina Bay Fi­nan­cial Cen­tre and Lon­don’s Ca­nary Wharf.</p>
    <p>Linked to the con­tro­ver­sial 1MDB scan­dal, the area is also home to South-east Asia’s tallest tower, Ex­change 106, which opened last year.</p>
    <p>The Ex­change TRX mall will have 2.2 mil­lion sq ft of space – dou­ble the size of Sin­ga­pore’s big­gest shop­ping cen­tre, VivoCity.</p>
    <p>“The Ex­change is de­vel­oped to be fu­ture-ready through de­sign and tech­nol­ogy to en­sure height­ened safety and health. Though there has been a fall in global growth, the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund is fore­cast­ing a re­bound of 5.4 per cent in 2021,” Mr Tony Lom­bardo, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the mall’s de­vel­oper Lendlease Asia, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The mall, which will have 500 stores and food and bev­er­age out­lets as well as a 4ha rooftop park, is ex­pected to draw on an es­ti­mated 45,000-strong work­force at the 28ha TRX devel­op­ment, which will also have 896 high-rise res­i­den­tial units by 2023.</p>
    <p>It will be one MRT stop away from Bukit Bin­tang, where Pav­il­ion KL mall is lo­cated, and two stops away from KLCC Suria mall at the base of the Petronas Twin Tow­ers.</p>
    <p>Two more Pav­il­ion malls, with 1.8 mil­lion sq ft and 1.17 mil­lion sq ft of re­tail space re­spec­tively, are ex­pected to open in the Klang Val­ley over the next two years.</p>
    <p>De­spite the new open­ings and weak econ­omy, mall op­er­a­tors are con­fi­dent there will be shop­pers.</p>
    <p>With the num­ber of Covid-19 cases fall­ing, move­ment re­stric­tions have been lifted since May as busi­nesses, schools and other sec­tors were grad­u­ally al­lowed to re­sume op­er­a­tions un­der what was known as a con­di­tional move­ment con­trol or­der (MCO) and later, a re­cov­ery MCO, and re­tail­ers are slowly re­cov­er­ing as a re­sult.</p>
    <p>Mr H.C. Chan, CEO of Sun­way Malls and Theme Parks, which op­er­ates seven malls across Malaysia, told The Straits Times: “For Sun­way Malls, we are see­ing foot­fall re­cov­ery in the 70 per cent range and sales in the 85 per cent range.</p>
    <p>“We hope to see re­cov­ery grow to 80 per cent for foot­fall and 90 per cent for sales when the year-end fes­tiv­i­ties set in, bar­ring un­fore­seen cir­cum­stances.”</p>
    <p>Pav­il­ion Reit Malls, which op­er­ates Pav­il­ion KL and two other malls in the Klang Val­ley, said its oc­cu­pancy rates re­main sta­ble, and that Pav­il­ion KL wel­comed new stores such as lux­ury brands Dior and Karl Lager­feld in July.</p>
    <p>Pav­il­ion Reit has also of­fered rental re­bates for re­tail­ers and in­tro­duced free park­ing and other shop­ping in­cen­tives.</p>
