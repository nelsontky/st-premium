    <p>As Covid-19 con­tin­ues to evis­cer­ate air travel, lead­ers from 20 ma­jor economies will meet vir­tu­ally later this week to tackle press­ing global is­sues: from en­sur­ing that Covid-19 vac­cines are dis­trib­uted fairly to re­liev­ing the poor­est coun­tries of crip­pling debt.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing as­sumed the pres­i­dency of the Group of 20 (G-20) last De­cem­ber, the King­dom of Saudi Ara­bia was able to pivot quickly to ad­dress these is­sues, said Sin­ga­pore’s Am­bas­sador to the king­dom Wong Chow Ming.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times last Tues­day from Riyadh, where he is based, the 54-year-old re­called how Saudi Ara­bia not only put to­gether the first vir­tual ex­traor­di­nary G-20 sum­mit in March, but also pledged US$500 mil­lion (S$674 mil­lion) to sup­port global pandemic ef­forts.</p>
    <p>The move sparked a chain re­ac­tion, he said. “This helped to gal­vanise the rest of the G-20 coun­tries to pledge al­to­gether US$21 bil­lion.”</p>
    <p>The G-20 com­prises 19 ad­vanced and emerg­ing economies and the Euro­pean Union, and con­vened its first sum­mit in 2008 in re­sponse to the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>This year’s sum­mit, whose theme is “Real­is­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties of the 21st cen­tury for all”, will be held this week­end.</p>
    <p>US$21 BIL­LION FOR VAC­CINES</p>
    <p>The G-20’s com­mit­ments this year in­clude restor­ing global growth, main­tain­ing mar­ket sta­bil­ity and strength­en­ing re­silience.</p>
    <p>Al­though the stand-off be­tween two of the group’s largest mem­bers – the United States and China – dark­ened the mood of the talks, mem­bers were able to ham­mer out a con­sen­sus to in­crease fund­ing for the re­search and de­vel­op­ment of vac­cines and medicines.</p>
    <p>They have con­trib­uted more than US$21 bil­lion for the pro­duc­tion and dis­tri­bu­tion of vac­cines.</p>
    <p>A debt sus­pen­sion ini­tia­tive was also ex­tended un­til next June, giv­ing 43 coun­tries more time to re­di­rect fund­ing to much-needed health­care and emer­gency stim­u­lus.</p>
    <p>The World Bank es­ti­mates that more than US$5 bil­lion in gov­ern­ment-to-gov­ern­ment debt has been de­ferred so far.</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore is not a G-20 mem­ber, it is in­vited to par­tic­i­pate in its ca­pac­ity as the con­vener of the Global Gov­er­nance Group (3G) – an in­for­mal coali­tion of 30 states that in­cludes Brunei, Malaysia, the Philip­pines, Viet­nam, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emi­rates, Fin­land, Switzer­land and New Zealand.</p>
    <p>The 3G in­flu­ences the G-20 to take into ac­count the in­ter­ests of smaller coun­tries af­fected by its de­ci­sions, and is reg­u­larly rep­re­sented at its sum­mits.</p>
    <p>“As a guest coun­try, we want to con­trib­ute as much as we can to the Saudi pres­i­dency’s pri­or­i­ties,” Mr Wong said.</p>
    <p>GET­TING SIN­GA­PORE­ANS HOME</p>
    <p>As the coro­n­avirus pro­lif­er­ated across the world in March, Saudi Ara­bia went into lock­down and sus­pended flights, leav­ing hun­dreds of Sin­ga­pore­ans there stranded.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic’s em­bassy, to­gether with Sin­ga­pore’s con­sulate­gen­eral in Jed­dah, reached out to Sin­ga­pore­ans by SMS, e-mail, phone calls and Face­book.</p>
    <p>“We fielded many calls for help, and also vis­ited Sin­ga­pore­ans who were in dis­tress and in hos­pi­tals,” said Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>His team has fa­cil­i­tated 10 flights out of the coun­try, start­ing in April with the repa­tri­a­tion of the first group of al­most 100 Sin­ga­pore­ans via a char­tered flight. The em­bassy also helped Malaysians who were re­turn­ing to Kuala Lumpur to tran­sit through Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>It was a lo­gis­ti­cal chal­lenge, Mr Wong said. “Be­cause there were re­stric­tions against trav­el­ling be­tween cities, we had to seek travel per­mits for all Sin­ga­pore­ans who wanted to fly.”</p>
    <p>The team char­tered buses to trans­port Sin­ga­pore­ans from cities all across Saudi Ara­bia to the air­ports in Riyadh and Jed­dah.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong him­self has stayed on in Saudi Ara­bia, away from his wife – who works in the med­i­cal sec­tor here – and four sons aged 19 to 25, who all live in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He ex­plained that his wife’s ca­reer and in­come would have taken a hit if she had fol­lowed him on over­seas post­ings.</p>
    <p>“I miss my wife, fam­ily and my mother very badly,” he said, ad­mit­ting that not be­ing with them to cel­e­brate birthdays and wed­ding an­niver­saries has been rough.</p>
    <p>“But I be­lieve that they are proud of my work as a pub­lic ser­vant.”</p>
    <p>A KING­DOM TRANS­FORM­ING</p>
    <p>HELP­ING SIN­GA­PORE­ANS</p>
    <p>Even as the G-20 lead­ers dis­cuss how to re­form the global econ­omy, Sau­dia Ara­bia and Bahrain are them­selves go­ing through mas­sive eco­nomic and so­cial change, said Mr Wong, who is also ac­cred­ited to Bahrain.</p>
    <p>Saudi Ara­bia has launched Vi­sion 2030, a re­form pro­gramme to pre­pare its econ­omy for a post-oil era.</p>
    <p>It is es­pe­cially keen on ar­eas such as health­care, smart cities, ports and lo­gis­tics, Mr Wong said.</p>
    <p>“Saudi Ara­bia and Bahrain want to di­ver­sify their economies away from heavy re­liance on oil and gas, im­prove their gov­ern­ment in­sti­tu­tions and business sec­tors, and nur­ture a more vi­brant and more in­clu­sive so­ci­ety. So there are many op­por­tu­ni­ties (for co­op­er­a­tion).”</p>
    <p>He called Pres­i­dent Halimah Yacob’s state visit last November at the in­vi­ta­tion of King Sal­man bin Ab­du­laziz Al Saud – the first to the king­dom by a Sin­ga­pore pres­i­dent – a high point in bi­lat­eral re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>The two sides inked a mem­o­ran­dum of un­der­stand­ing on en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion and wa­ter re­sources man­age­ment, and also dis­cussed the es­tab­lish­ment of a Saudi-Sin­ga­pore Joint Com­mit­tee to fa­cil­i­tate co­op­er­a­tion be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Madam Halimah also spoke of the po­ten­tial for col­lab­o­ra­tion in tourism, fin­tech, ur­ban plan­ning and in­fra­struc­ture, as well as in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is also keen to sup­port Saudi Ara­bia’s Vi­sion 2030 trans­for­ma­tion plan, Mr Wong said.</p>
    <p>“In­shal­lah (God will­ing, in Ara­bic) we hope that we have more good news to con­vey to you in the near fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>We fielded many calls for help, and also vis­ited Sin­ga­pore­ans who were in dis­tress and in hos­pi­tals... Be­cause there were re­stric­tions against trav­el­ling be­tween cities, we had to seek travel per­mits for all Sin­ga­pore­ans who wanted to fly.</p>
