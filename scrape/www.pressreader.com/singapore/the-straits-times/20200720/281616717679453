    <p>A 15-year-old boy has been charged by the London Met­ro­pol­i­tan Po­lice over his al­leged in­volve­ment in a racially ag­gra­vated as­sault on Sin­ga­porean stu­dent Jonathan Mok in London.</p>
    <p>A po­lice spokesman said the boy was charged with wound­ing or in­flict­ing griev­ous bod­ily harm with­out in­tent and will ap­pear at High­bury Corner Mag­is­trates’ Court on Aug 10.</p>
    <p>The po­lice added that a 16-yearold boy who was ar­rested on March 4 in con­nec­tion with the case has been re­leased with no fur­ther ac­tion taken against him.</p>
    <p>On March 3, Mr Mok, 23, opened up on Face­book about the at­tack, which took place in Ox­ford Street near the London Un­der­ground’s Tottenham Court Road train sta­tion.</p>
    <p>The Univer­sity Col­lege London law stu­dent said he heard a group of young peo­ple say “coro­n­avirus” as he walked past them at about 9.15pm on Feb 24.</p>
    <p>When he turned to face the group, he was punched in the face, with one of the sus­pects say­ing “I don’t want your coro­n­avirus in my coun­try” be­fore the group fled.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent re­sulted in Mr Mok hav­ing to go for fa­cial surgery, re­ported Chi­nese daily Lianhe Zaobao.</p>
    <p>On March 4, the Sin­ga­pore High Com­mis­sion in London said on Face­book that it was “deeply dis­turbed” by the at­tack and recog­nised its “broader im­pli­ca­tions”, given the large Sin­ga­porean com­mu­nity in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>It also promised to en­sure that the London Met­ro­pol­i­tan Po­lice “fol­low through with their in­ves­ti­ga­tion with the ut­most pri­or­ity”.</p>
    <p>“(We) do not be­lieve that the as­sault re­flects the ma­jor­ity view of the Bri­tish peo­ple in par­tic­u­lar to­wards Sin­ga­pore, given the close and spe­cial re­la­tion­ship be­tween the UK and Sin­ga­pore,” the High Com­mis­sion added.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish High Com­mis­sioner in Sin­ga­pore Kara Owen said in a tweet on March 3 that she was “shocked and sad­dened by the at­tack” and wished Mr Mok a speedy re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Mr Mok said in his Face­book post: “Why should any­one, sim­ply be­cause of the colour of their skin, be sub­jected to abuse, in any form, ver­bal or phys­i­cal? Why should I keep quiet when some­one makes a racist re­mark to­wards me?</p>
    <p>“Racism is not stu­pid­ity – racism is hate. Racists con­stantly find ex­cuses to ex­pound their ha­tred – and in this cur­rent back­drop of the coro­n­avirus, they’ve found yet an­other ex­cuse.”</p>
