    <p>Bri­tish bil­lion­aire in­ven­tor James Dyson is sell­ing his lux­u­ri­ous Singapore pent­house atop the city state’s tallest build­ing, his com­pany said yes­ter­day, about a year af­ter buy­ing it for a re­ported $73.8 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Singapore’s tallest pent­house, on the top three lev­els of the 64-storey Guoco Tower in Tan­jong Pa­gar, is nearly $3,000 per sq ft on the strata area of 21,108 sq ft. It comes with its own in­fin­ity pool and pri­vate lift lobby from the base­ment carpark, and has panoramic views of the city, in­clud­ing the Ma­rina Bay wa­ter­front area.</p>
    <p>The ty­coon’s pur­chase of the Wal­lich Res­i­dence pent­house last year – af­ter his elec­tric ap­pli­ance firm Dyson an­nounced that it was shift­ing its global head­quar­ters to the city state from Eng­land – set a record for Singapore pent­houses.</p>
    <p>A spokesman told Agence France-Presse that an of­fer had been ac­cepted for the three-floor res­i­dence, which also has a 600-bot­tle wine cel­lar and a ded­i­cated but­ler ser­vice.</p>
    <p>He did not give de­tails of the sale, but it ap­pears that Mr Dyson has made a hefty loss. The Busi­ness Times re­ported that the prop­erty was bought by a busi­ness­man in the United States for $62 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>De­spite the sale, the spokesman said: “Dyson re­mains fully com­mit­ted to ex­pand­ing its re­search and de­vel­op­ment foot­print and other op­er­a­tions in Singapore.”</p>
    <p>The buyer is In­done­sia-born ty­coon Leo Koguan, a US cit­i­zen and</p>
    <p>Texas res­i­dent. He is co-founder and chairman of IT provider SHI In­ter­na­tional, BT re­ported, with­out cit­ing sources.</p>
    <p>The Dysons also bought a bun­ga­low near the Singapore Botanic Gar­dens last year for $50 mil­lion, which they still own.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s move to Singapore prompted fury in Bri­tain that the ty­coon – a vo­cal Brexit backer – was not in­vest­ing more in Bri­tish man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>The firm aban­doned plans to pro</p>
    <p>duce elec­tric cars last year, say­ing the project was not com­mer­cially vi­able. Its first ve­hi­cle plant was to be lo­cated in Singapore.</p>
    <p>Mr Dyson, who em­ploys 1,200 people here, told The Straits Times in an interview pub­lished on Sun</p>
    <p>day that Singapore and the new HQ at the iconic St James Power Sta­tion will be at the cen­tre of his firm’s growth plans, which in­clude re­search, de­vel­op­ment and the man­u­fac­ture of new tech­nolo­gies.</p>
