    <p>Tai­wanese girl group S.H.E mem­ber Selina Jen’s younger sis­ter, ac­tress Lorene J en (left), has re­port­edly been cosy­ing up to Boris Lin – Me­di­a­corp ac­tress Car­rie Wong’s boyfriend.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Tai­wanese press re­ports, the younger Jen, 32, had ac­com­pa­nied her par­ents and el­der sis­ter to S.H.E mem­ber Ella Chen’s con­cert last month.</p>
    <p>After the show, she was pho­tographed get­ting sent home by Lin, who re­port­edly stayed the night.</p>
    <p>Lin has not re­sponded to the dat­ing ru­mours, but Jen told the Tai­wanese me­dia through her man­ager: “We’re friends who are get­ting to know each other right now.”</p>
    <p>Lin is a for­mer Tai­wanese model who used to be with the mod­el­ling agency Cat­walk. He has since left the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try and is bet­ter known in Sin­ga­pore as Wong’s boyfriend. The cou­ple went pub­lic with their re­la­tion­ship on Valen­tine’s Day last year.</p>
    <p>There is spec­u­la­tion that Wong, 26, may have bro­ken up with Lin.</p>
    <p>When Chi­nese news out­let Shin Min Daily News ap­proached Wong’s man­ager with news of Lin and Jen and asked if she was still dat­ing Lin, Wong replied through her man­ager: “No com­ment.”</p>
    <p>Shin Min had re­ported in July that Wong and Lin seemed to have deleted most pho­to­graphs of the two of them to­gether.</p>
    <p>There is cur­rently no trace of Lin found on Wong’s In­sta­gram ac­count. She can still be seen with friends in some pic­tures on his ac­count – though there are no longer pic­tures of the cou­ple alone.</p>
    <p>In a se­ries of pho­to­graphs Lin up­loaded dur­ing his birth­day in July, Jen is among a large group of friends in the first pic­ture. Wong can be seen in another group in the third pic­ture. It is not clear when the pho­tos were taken.</p>
    <p>This is not the first time that Lin’s love life has been the sub­ject of at­ten­tion. He be­came em­broiled in a scan­dal last year when pri­vate texts of a sex­u­ally ex­plicit and flir­ta­tious na­ture be­tween Wong and fel­low Me­di­a­corp ac­tor Ian Fang were leaked.</p>
    <p>At the time, Wong and Lin were an item and Fang had long been linked to another Me­di­a­corp ac­tress, Re­becca Lim.</p>
    <p>Lin stood by Wong after the in­ci­dent, say­ing that she did “noth­ing wrong”, go­ing so far as to lam­bast Fang for “act­ing in­no­cent and piti­ful” be­fore the me­dia.</p>
