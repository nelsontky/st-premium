    <p>HONG KONG • Samantha burst into tears when she opened the box from florist Elise Ip on Christ­mas Day. It was a sur­prise gift from her boyfriend, in cus­tody for join­ing last year’s Hong Kong protests.</p>
    <p>“She loves dogs but she loves me more,” he had writ­ten on a slip of pa­per sent from a de­ten­tion cen­tre and re­layed to Ms Ip via a prisoner sup­port group or­gan­ised by for­mer so­cial wel­fare leg­is­la­tor Shiu Ka Chun.</p>
    <p>Mr Shiu formed the group Wal­lFare that pro­vides ser­vices like pen pal match­ing as well as flower and snack de­liv­ery, and helps con­tact rel­a­tives of peo­ple in jail.</p>
    <p>Af­ter read­ing the writ­ten note, Ms Ip had found Samantha, who used a pseu­do­nym, a cac­tus shaped like a puppy’s head.</p>
    <p>“Re­ceiv­ing this is a great sup­port to me,” Samantha told Agence France-Presse (AFP). “Those in cus­tody don’t re­ally have the op­por­tu­nity to send flow­ers or gifts to us.”</p>
    <p>More than 10,000 peo­ple have been ar­rested, and thou­sands pros­e­cuted, for join­ing the pro-democ­racy protests that con­vulsed the Asian fi­nan­cial cen­tre for seven months from June last year.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of those re­manded has been ris­ing, and pro­tect­ing pris­on­ers’ rights has be­come in­creas­ingly dif­fi­cult af­ter pro-demo­cratic leg­is­la­tors were forced out of the city’s leg­is­la­ture. The au­thor­i­ties have also tight­ened rules around of­fi­cial vis­its.</p>
    <p>Samantha is one of more than 50 rel­a­tives and friends who have re­ceived gifts or­dered be­hind bars and pre­pared by Ms Ip, who ini­ti­ated the free Send Flow­ers With You project in July.</p>
    <p>“I hoped it would make peo­ple in­side and out­side the pris­ons feel closer to each other,” Ms Ip told AFP.</p>
    <p>“With every story told in each de­liv­ery, I also wish to re­mind the world that many have sac­ri­ficed their nor­mal and happy life for the city.”</p>
