    <p>Un­her­alded Kelly Tan (right) showed she can give the world’s best women golfers a run for their money, af­ter fir­ing five birdies in a three-un­der 67 to share the Women’s PGA Cham­pi­onship open­ing-round lead with twice Ma­jor win­ner Brit­tany Lin­ci­come. “I think I am in a good spot,” said the 26-year-old Malaysian.</p>
    <p>NEW YORK • Malaysia’s Kelly Tan was pleased with her ball-strik­ing af­ter she birdied three of her first four holes in shoot­ing a three-un­der 67 to match Amer­i­can Brit­tany Lin­ci­come for the lead af­ter Thurs­day’s open­ing round of the Women’s PGA Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>World No. 189 Tan, seek­ing her first LPGA vic­tory, sank three birdie putts from 25 feet and be­yond to help off­set two bo­geys in a tough open­ing round at Aron­imink in New­town Square, Penn­syl­va­nia.</p>
    <p>“Ball-strik­ing was re­ally good to­day,” she said. “I just feel like I was hit­ting to the right spot, giv­ing my­self those up­hill looks, and made a few nice 20 to 30-foot­ers.”</p>
    <p>Lin­ci­come man­aged four birdies against a lone bo­gey as she chases a third Ma­jor vic­tory af­ter the 2009 and 2015 ANA In­spi­ra­tion ti­tles.</p>
    <p>“Very happy,” she said. “To­day it was kind of trust­ing my process, fair­ways and greens, be­ing ag­gres­sive, don’t leave the putts short, and kind of just at­tack the golf course, and it kind of worked, which is re­ally scary be­cause this golf course was not easy. It was re­ally windy. It was cold at times.”</p>
    <p>A pack on 68 in joint third com­prised New Zealand’s Ly­dia Ko, Swe­den’s Lin­nea Strom, Spain’s Car­lota Ci­ganda, Mex­ico’s Gaby Lopez and Amer­i­cans Danielle Kang and Cyd­ney Clan­ton.</p>
    <p>Un­her­alded Tan, 26, pro­duced her best LPGA fin­ish with a share of fourth as a rookie at the 2014 Marathon Clas­sic and did not crack the top 10 again un­til Au­gust, when she shared ninth in the Marathon in only the sec­ond event back af­ter a coro­n­avirus shut­down in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>“I try to tell my­self that ev­ery day I have a lit­tle goal and try to achieve them and build con­fi­dence from there,” she said. “My ball-strik­ing has been re­ally good and I think that has been a key and it has been giv­ing me a lot of con­fi­dence go­ing into the next day.”</p>
    <p>Her goal for round one was to stay calm and wait for op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>“Just stay pa­tient, take those 30-, 50-foot­ers if you have to,” she said.</p>
    <p>“It was re­ally hard on some of the holes to take the flag out of con­sid­er­a­tion. I think I did that re­ally well, and I’m re­ally proud about that.”</p>
    <p>She opened at the par-four 10th hole and made a 25-foot birdie putt, then added a seven-footer for birdie at the next and 30-foot birdie putts at the par-four 13th and 18th holes. She made bo­geys at the par-four first and fourth holes but an­swered with a six-foot birdie putt at the par-four sev­enth.</p>
    <p>“It’s a Ma­jor cham­pi­onship. You’re go­ing to make bo­geys,” she added. “I just look at it as those things are go­ing to hap­pen. I’m not a ro­bot. I’m not go­ing to hit it to a per­fect spot ev­ery time. Just keep telling my­self to keep giv­ing my­self chances and I did that very well com­ing home. This is a tough golf course, and I just feel like I hit it to the right spots. I could be ag­gres­sive on my putts and just re­ally nice to see those long ones go in.</p>
    <p>“I think I’m in a good spot.” Lin­ci­come birdied the sec­ond, took a bo­gey at the par-three fifth, then added birdies at the par-five ninth, par-four 11th and par-three 17th to claim a share of the lead, miss­ing only one green in reg­u­la­tion all day de­spite tricky winds.</p>
    <p>“Just try­ing to be ag­gres­sive,” she said. “We left a few putts short com­ing in. It was just tempo with the swing to­day and try­ing to swing slow.”</p>
    <p>It’s a Ma­jor cham­pi­onship. You’re go­ing to make bo­geys. I just look at it as those things are go­ing to hap­pen. I’m not a ro­bot. I’m not go­ing to hit it to a per­fect spot ev­ery time. ’’</p>
    <p>KELLY TAN, world No. 189, on not feel­ing too down about dropped shots.</p>
