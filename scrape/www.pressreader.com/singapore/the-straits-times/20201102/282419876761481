    <p>Lau­rie Her­nan­dez is de­ter­mined not be de­fined by the men­tal abuse she suf­fered un­der her for­mer coach and hav­ing re­lo­cated from her na­tive New Jersey to Cal­i­for­nia, she is hop­ing the fresh start will al­low her to win more Olympic medals.</p>
    <p>Af­ter win­ning two medals at the 2016 Rio Games, the 20-year-old gym­nast opted to take a break from the sport that had dom­i­nated her young life.</p>
    <p>But two years into her hia­tus, the</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can re­alised the psy­cho­log­i­cal abuse she had faced from her coach Mag­gie Haney had noth­ing to do with gym­nas­tics.</p>
    <p>“I don’t hate the sport and I didn’t hate the sport,” Her­nan­dez told Reuters. “I didn’t like the en­vi­ron­ment that I was in.”</p>
    <p>She went public in April, de­scrib­ing on so­cial me­dia how Haney hu­mil­i­ated her, com­mented on her weight and made her train de­spite mul­ti­ple in­juries. Due to the abuse, she de­vel­oped an eat­ing dis­or­der.</p>
    <p>She tes­ti­fied against Haney at a USA Gym­nas­tics hear­ing that led to the coach be­ing sus­pended for eight years.</p>
    <p>“It was re­ally dif­fi­cult, es­pe­cially dur­ing an Olympic year and try­ing to train for a re­ally big com­pe­ti­tion,” she said. “Push­ing (your­self) to a phys­i­cal limit and then also men­tally hav­ing to go back and talk about it.”</p>
    <p>Her­nan­dez, who won sil­ver on the bal­ance beam and gold in the team com­pe­ti­tion in Rio, said the ban marked a ma­jor step to­ward ad­dress­ing psy­cho­log­i­cally abu­sive be­hav­iour in the sport.</p>
    <p>“We’re in 2020 and we can’t treat peo­ple like we used to a cou­ple of decades ago,” she added.</p>
    <p>“It’s time to be re­ally re­spect­ful to ev­ery­body – es­pe­cially when it comes to kids.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing her time away from gym­nas­tics, she knew she had to make dras­tic changes in or­der to re­turn to com­pet­i­tive ac­tion, re­sult­ing in her move to a dif­fer­ent state and switch­ing coaches.</p>
    <p>“I want to make the Olympic team. That’s the rea­son why I’m back,” she said. “But the most im­por­tant part is that I’m feel­ing safe and that I’m lov­ing what I do.”</p>
    <p>With the Tokyo Games post­poned un­til next July be­cause of the coron­avirus pan­demic, Her­nan­dez has had more time to hone her tech­nique and up­grade her rou­tines.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause the Olympics were de­layed, it’s go­ing to be that much sweeter,” she said. “I think a lot of peo­ple across the globe are just so ex­cited to see what we can achieve and get back out there. It’s go­ing to be great.”</p>
