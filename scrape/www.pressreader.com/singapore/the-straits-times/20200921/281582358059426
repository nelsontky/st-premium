    <p>A com­pre­hen­sive re­view of is­sues af­fect­ing women is be­ing un­der­taken, with the aim of bring­ing about a cul­tural and mind­set change on val­ues such as gen­der equal­ity and re­spect for women. It will seek to in­stil gen­der equal­ity as a fun­da­men­tal value.</p>
    <p>A com­pre­hen­sive re­view of is­sues af­fect­ing women is be­ing un­der­taken, with the aim of bring­ing about a cul­tural and mind­set change on val­ues such as gen­der equal­ity and re­spect for women.</p>
    <p>Sparked in part by in­ci­dents of voyeurism on cam­puses, the re­view will seek to in­stil gen­der equal­ity as a fun­da­men­tal value that is in­ter­nalised by boys and girls from a young age, said Min­is­ter for Home Af­fairs and Law K. Shan­mugam at a di­a­logue yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It will be led by Min­is­ter of State for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment as well as Ed­u­ca­tion Sun Xuel­ing, Min­is­ter of State for Cul­ture, Community and Youth as well as Trade and In­dus­try Low Yen Ling, and Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary for Health Ra­hayu Mahzam.</p>
    <p>The di­a­logue, ti­tled Con­ver­sa­tions on Women’s De­vel­op­ment, opened a se­ries of up­com­ing ses­sions with stake­hold­ers, in­clud­ing women’s and youth groups, to col­lect feed­back and rec­om­men­da­tions.</p>
    <p>The ideas and sug­ges­tions gath­ered through this process will form the ba­sis of a White Pa­per to be tabled in Par­lia­ment in the first half of next year, Mr Shan­mugam said.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to an au­di­ence of about 60 par­tic­i­pants, the min­is­ter added: “The White Pa­per will aim to ad­dress women-re­lated is­sues that Sin­ga­pore­ans are con­cerned with. It will aim to be a fur­ther road map for progress, a path­way to­wards greater gen­der equal­ity.”</p>
    <p>He said women in Sin­ga­pore have made strides in ar­eas like the work­force, pol­i­tics and ed­u­ca­tion, but there needs to be a cul­tural and mind­set change in so­ci­ety to­wards gen­der equal­ity and re­spect for women. Is­sues like sex­ual vi­o­lence, voyeurism, and dif­fer­en­tial treat­ment in the of­fice based on gen­der should, he added, be con­sid­ered “a deep vi­o­la­tion of fun­da­men­tal val­ues”.</p>
    <p>The re­view, Mr Shan­mugam said, will be broadly cat­e­gorised to ad­dress the sort of changes in mind­set needed and how to de­velop them from a young age. It will tackle is­sues in the home, such as pro­tect­ing women from be­ing vic­tims of vi­o­lence from fam­ily mem­bers and in­ti­mate part­ners.</p>
    <p>It will also try to bet­ter recog­nise the i ndis­pens­able roles women play as wives, moth­ers, care­givers and home­mak­ers, he added.</p>
    <p>It will ex­am­ine the way women are viewed in school and the work­place, and tackle the need for equal op­por­tu­ni­ties and pro­tec­tion from sex­ual ha­rass­ment, as­sault and work­place dis­crim­i­na­tion, he said.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, it will look at is­sues in the community, like gen­der stereo­typ­ing and how women are ad­dressed in the man­ner of speech or ways of think­ing, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said a spate of re­cent of­fences against women in the news, in­clud­ing in­stances of voyeurism and vi­o­lence, had set him think­ing about whether there is a more philo­soph­i­cal and fun­da­men­tal way of think­ing about gen­der equal­ity.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing dur­ing the round-up of the ses­sion, Ms Sun said: “When we say women have choices, are they real choices?</p>
    <p>“Are they able to ful­fil their po­ten­tial, be the best that they can be, in an un­en­cum­bered fash­ion that does not re­quire them to set­tle for sec­ond best?”</p>
    <p>Said Ms Ra­hayu: “Covid-19 has brought to the fore­front a slew of is­sues that women have been fac­ing for years, such as bear­ing the main care­giv­ing re­spon­si­bil­i­ties in the house­hold, and be­ing held to dif­fer­ent stan­dards at the work­place.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese are is­sues that our moth­ers, daugh­ters and sis­ters are fac­ing on a daily ba­sis. There may be progress on some fronts but we need ev­ery­one to chip in on the way for­ward for women in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Ms Low said: “With col­lec­tive ac­tion, we can close the doors of dis­par­ity and con­tinue to widen the stride for Sin­ga­pore women.</p>
    <p>“As we al­low our­selves to chal­lenge old at­ti­tudes and cur­rent stereo­types, we will dis­lodge prac­tices that hin­der women’s de­vel­op­ment and free up our so­ci­ety for greater progress.”</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said the out­come of the di­a­logues would not just be a White Pa­per with rec­om­men­da­tions. “It has got to be a clear mes­sage to ev­ery young girl today, and in the fu­ture, that Sin­ga­pore will al­ways be a place where they can achieve their fullest po­ten­tial, ful­fil their hopes and ful­fil their dreams.”</p>
