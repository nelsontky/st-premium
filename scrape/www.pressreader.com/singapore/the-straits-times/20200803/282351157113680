    <p>ROME • Only Luis Suarez has ever beaten Lionel Messi or Cris­tiano Ron­aldo out­right in the past 11 years to land the Euro­pean Golden Shoe, which is awarded to the con­ti­nent’s top scorer at the end of the do­mes­tic sea­son.</p>
    <p>So af­ter scor­ing his 36th goal as Lazio ended their Serie A cam­paign with a 3-1 loss at Napoli on Satur­day, Ciro Im­mo­bile was de­lighted to be among rar­efied com­pany.</p>
    <p>The Italy striker told Lazio Style Chan­nel: “I’m su­per happy and proud of what I’ve achieved, es­pe­cially when I look back to where I started and ev­ery­thing I went through.</p>
    <p>“If you truly be­lieve, some­times, dreams do come true. I can only thank the coach and staff, my team­mates, and I can as­sure you th­ese records are for the whole team.</p>
    <p>“I also thank the Lazio fans, who made me feel in­dis­pens­able for this team, and I’m so proud of that.</p>
    <p>“I want to be a liv­ing ex­am­ple that if you never give up, you can achieve any tar­get. I’m so proud to have my place in the his­tory of this sport. I am moved think­ing of how my team­mates greeted me in the dress­ing room af­ter I scored a hat­trick at Verona (last week).”</p>
    <p>This is the third time Im­mo­bile has fin­ished the Scud­etto’s top scorer. He scored 22 goals with Torino in the 2013-14 sea­son and 29 goals in the 2017-2018 term to share top billing with then In­ter Mi­lan striker Mauro Icardi.</p>
    <p>But this feat means more to the 30-year-old, who matched Gon­zalo Higuain’s record for the most num­ber of strikes in a sin­gle Ital­ian league sea­son, which the Ar­gen­tinian set in 2015-16 for Napoli.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause Lazio will be play­ing in the Cham­pi­ons League next sea­son for the first time since 2007. His goal rush en­sured they fin­ished fourth in the league, although he con­ceded that re­in­force­ments would be needed if they are to win only their third Serie A ti­tle on top of mak­ing an im­pact in Europe.</p>
    <p>He added: “Our tar­get is to im­prove, although it’ll be very dif­fi­cult with a whole other com­pe­ti­tion in the Cham­pi­ons League.”</p>
    <p>Ron­aldo has yet to se­cure the top scorer award in his two terms with Ital­ian cham­pi­ons Ju­ven­tus, fin­ish­ing se­cond-best with 31 goals.</p>
    <p>Barcelona’s Messi scored 25 times to win La Liga’s Golden Boot.</p>
