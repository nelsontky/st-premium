    <p>Ukraine coach An­driy Shevchenko praised his side for brush­ing aside last week’s em­bar­rass­ing 7-1 thrash­ing by France to pull off a shock 1-0 win over Spain in the Na­tions League on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Vik­tor Tsy­gankov struck the only goal l ate i n the game to give Ukraine their first-ever vic­tory in seven matches against Spain and end a three-game los­ing streak in which they were also beaten 4-0 by Spain and 2-1 by Ger­many.</p>
    <p>“I don’t even need to say any­thing be­cause my play­ers have said ev­ery­thing with their at­ti­tude and com­mit­ment,” Shevchenko told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“It’s their vic­tory, they were sim­ply great. The guys have learnt their les­son af­ter the France game, they ac­cepted the changes we sug­gested and ful­filled our plan.</p>
    <p>“It was hard to com­pete with Spain but we fought all the time and we won lots of balls. We wanted to win and we won.”</p>
    <p>His coun­try’s all-time top scorer and ar­guably their great­est ever player, Shevchenko over­saw a sen­sa­tional cam­paign to qual­ify for the post­poned Euro­pean Cham­pi­onships.</p>
    <p>But his team were heav­ily de­pleted for this month’s in­ter­na­tional fix­tures due to a spate of pos­i­tive coro­n­avirus cases, plus in­juries.</p>
    <p>Ukraine were over­whelmed by world cham­pi­ons France last week but much im­proved in Satur­day’s 2-1 de­feat by Ger­many, be­fore top­pling Spain in front of 21,000 noisy sup­port­ers in Kiev’s Olympic Sta­dium, which was at 30 per cent ca­pac­ity thanks to Uefa’s eas­ing of coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions in cer­tain re­gions.</p>
    <p>Spain goal­keeper David de Gea, crit­i­cised for er­ror-prone dis­plays at his club Manch­ester United, was caught out of po­si­tion in the leadup to the goal.</p>
    <p>The Spa­niards had 21 shots in to­tal to Ukraine’s two as Luis En­rique’s side lost for the first time since Croa­tia beat them 3-2 in Novem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>But the Spain coach re­fused to blame any in­di­vid­ual for the goal.</p>
    <p>He said: “Blam­ing de Gea is al­ready wrong, it puts a lot on him. The re­spon­si­bil­ity for each goal lies with the whole team.</p>
    <p>“We have made chances to kill them. It was a game of clear con­trol of us, with Adama Traore we have gen­er­ated chances with his over­lap.</p>
    <p>“In the end we went into panic mode. But I like the at­ti­tude of the play­ers, I like what I see.”</p>
