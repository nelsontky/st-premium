    <p>In­done­sian Pres­i­dent Joko</p>
    <p>Wi­dodo found him­self trapped be­tween a rock and a hard place when he had to de­cide whether to hold a re­gional elec­tion in the midst of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>For months, crit­ics pres­sured him to de­lay the Sept 23 polls, known as pilkada, to elect 270 gov­er­nors, re­gents and may­ors across the coun­try. He ac­ceded once, push­ing the date to Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Yet, with the elec­tion date fast ap­proach­ing, the virus is far from con­tained in In­done­sia, which re­mains the worst-hit coun­try in South-east Asia with more than 575,000 cases and 17,740 deaths, as at yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Pressed again to post­pone the polls, the Pres­i­dent would not budge. His ad­min­is­tra­tion ar­gued that de­lay­ing the elec­tions would deny peo­ple their con­sti­tu­tional rights to choose their lead­ers and would cre­ate a power vac­uum in the re­gions.</p>
    <p>Mr Joko’s de­ci­sion to go ahead sug­gests that the eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal fac­tors of hold­ing the polls re­main top­most in his mind, an­a­lysts told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Elec­tions gen­er­ally boost peo­ple’s spend­ing and stim­u­late the economy, through the pro­cure­ment of elec­tion lo­gis­tics and can­di­date cam­paign ac­tiv­i­ties, among other things.</p>
    <p>More­over, most of the elec­tion bud­get has been spent by now. Any de­lay would re­quire a fresh al­lo­ca­tion of funds, thin­ning the state cof­fers fur­ther.</p>
    <p>Then there are con­cerns of a po­lit­i­cal back­lash from the can­di­dates, who have poured mil­lions of dol­lars into their cam­paigns, not to men­tion the po­lit­i­cal back­ing from in­flu­en­tial fig­ures and po­lit­i­cal par­ties, an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>Ms Titi Ang­graini, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of the As­so­ci­a­tion for Elec­tions and Democ­racy, noted some be­lieve that Mr Joko’s in­sis­tence on hold­ing the elec­tions is out of per­sonal in­ter­est, given that his son Gi­bran Rak­abum­ing Raka and son-in-law Bobby Afif Na­su­tion are in may­oral races.</p>
    <p>“Hold­ing the elec­tions now is merely to serve the prag­matic in­ter­ests of the politi­cians and the elites,” she told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“The politi­cians don’t want to lose any time to as­sume power. They don’t want shorter terms in of­fice.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ach­mad Sukar­sono, a se­nior an­a­lyst at con­sul­tancy group Con­trol Risks, said that in the ab­sence of elected lead­ers, Jakarta would ap­point non-par­ti­san “care­tak­ers”, usu­ally of­fi­cials from the Home Min­istry, po­lice or mil­i­tary, bur­den­ing these in­di­vid­u­als be­yond their du­ties of law en­force­ment and na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>“There are cases where the care­tak­ers try to gov­ern, but these never end well,” he said, cit­ing a case in Makas­sar, in South Su­lawesi, where re­gional par­lia­men­tar­i­ans had dis­puted poli­cies put forth by the care­taker mayor, spark­ing po­lit­i­cal con­flict within the re­gion.</p>
    <p>What all the ex­perts agree on is that the elec­tions could trig­ger a spike in cases, even with health pro­to­cols in place.</p>
    <p>In­done­sians have al­ways been com­mu­nity-ori­ented, mak­ing it hard for them to prac­tise so­cial dis­tanc­ing, said Mr Ach­mad.</p>
    <p>He added: “Dur­ing the elec­tion in Sin­ga­pore, I can see peo­ple stand­ing far apart from one an­other. But it’s not in­grained in the In­done­sian char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>“The surge will clearly hap­pen. It will be a su­per-spreader event.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ach­mad ex­pressed con­cern that the elec­tions would be the source of new clus­ters in the ru­ral re­gions, which cur­rently have low in­fec­tion rates. With the lack of test­ing and health treat­ment fa­cil­i­ties, these cases would largely go un­de­tected.</p>
    <p>Ms Titi said that while the gov­ern­ment has harped on the mer­its of so­cial dis­tanc­ing, wear­ing masks and wash­ing hands, it has failed to in­cor­po­rate these rules into the elec­toral process.</p>
    <p>“There are no spe­cial vot­ing ar­range­ments, such as ex­tend­ing vot­ing time or stag­ger­ing vot­ing hours,” said Ms Titi.</p>
    <p>“At the very least, the gov­ern­ment should have waited for cases to de­cline. The peo­ple’s knowl­edge about the virus is still poor, and many still don’t ad­here to health pro­to­cols.”</p>
    <p>Still, Dr Pandu Riono, an epi­demi­ol­o­gist from the Univer­sity of In­done­sia in West Java, said the elec­tions are just the tip of the ice­berg in en­cour­ag­ing trans­mis­sions.</p>
    <p>He told The Straits Times: “Don’t just blame a sin­gle event. The high num­ber of cases is the re­sult of the last long hol­i­days. Like­wise, with the pilkada and other ac­tiv­i­ties such as the year-end hol­i­days, I fore­see that cases will con­tinue to rise un­til 2021.”</p>
