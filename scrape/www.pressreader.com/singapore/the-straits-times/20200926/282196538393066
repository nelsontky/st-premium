    <p>It has been al­most six months since the Covid-19 pan­demic be­gan, and in many ways it feels like we have made it through the worst.</p>
    <p>Life has not fully re­turned to nor­mal, but we are mak­ing ad­just­ments to keep our­selves and our loved ones safe by work­ing in split shifts, lim­it­ing so­cial gath­er­ings and find­ing new ways to un­wind.</p>
    <p>But there are oth­ers who may be ex­pe­ri­enc­ing “pan­demic fa­tigue”. As the pan­demic drags on, many might at­test to ex­pe­ri­enc­ing un­cer­tainty over how long it will last, strug­gling to stay re­silient, weary of con­tin­u­ing with safe dis­tanc­ing ef­forts, and hav­ing deeper neg­a­tive moods.</p>
    <p>While pan­demic fa­tigue may not be an of­fi­cial med­i­cal con­di­tion, it can take a toll on men­tal health, im­pact job per­for­mance and pro­duc­tiv­ity, and hin­der busi­ness re­silience.</p>
    <p>As the eco­nomic im­pact of the pan­demic con­tin­ues to un­fold, busi­ness lead­ers and em­ploy­ees need to adopt a shared re­spon­si­bil­ity to ad­dress th­ese chal­lenges. It is vi­tal to build a holis­tic work­force re­silience pro­gramme where em­ploy­ees feel their health, safety and well-be­ing are key pri­or­i­ties.</p>
    <p>A key pil­lar of the ap­proach by In­ter­na­tional SOS – which is in the busi­ness of work­force re­silience – is to im­ple­ment a sus­tain­able sup­port struc­ture for all em­ploy­ees via ef­fec­tive and em­pa­thetic com­mu­ni­ca­tion chan­nels.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­lar sit­u­a­tional up­dates and check-ins with em­ploy­ees go a long way in en­sur­ing man­agers are aware of any strug­gles that em­ploy­ees might be fac­ing, re­duc­ing feel­ings of un­cer­tainty and anx­i­ety among them, and equip­ping them well to ad­dress any ex­ist­ing or emerg­ing chal­lenges at the work­place.</p>
    <p>To this end, In­ter­na­tional SOS has de­vel­oped a range of tools, such as its Covid-19 web­site, which is open to the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>It is also work­ing with or­gan­i­sa­tions in the re­tail and hos­pi­tal­ity in­dus­tries – which are among the hard­est-hit sec­tors – to help them re­cal­i­brate and pre­pare for their road to re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes re­view­ing ex­ist­ing poli­cies, iden­ti­fy­ing gaps and rec­om­mend­ing im­prove­ments, as well as equip­ping teams with the means and will to ad­just to th­ese new pro­to­cols. The aim is to main­tain a healthy and re­silient work­force dur­ing the pan­demic and be­yond.</p>
    <p>In­di­vid­u­als can also take steps to ease pan­demic fa­tigue. Some of th­ese steps in­clude:</p>
    <p>• Ac­cept­ing neg­a­tive emo­tions. Be honest about pent-up emo­tions like anx­i­ety and un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>• Cre­at­ing new goals. Set per­sonal goals that are achiev­able, en­joy­able and will give a sense of ac­com­plish­ment, whether it is ex­er­cise or small weekly so­cial gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>• Con­serv­ing emo­tional re­sources. When nec­es­sary, em­ploy­ees should take time out from work to pri­ori­tise self-care. They can take their an­nual leave, even if it is just to re­lax at home or to spend time with loved ones.</p>
    <p>• Be­ing kind to them­selves. Em­ploy­ees should recog­nise that it is okay to have both good and bad days. In­stead of fo­cus­ing on the neg­a­tives, they can ac­knowl­edge and cel­e­brate their achieve­ments.</p>
    <p>• Ask­ing for help. Al­most ev­ery­one has ex­pe­ri­enced some level of dis­com­fort dur­ing this pe­riod, so em­ploy­ees do not have to be afraid to seek sup­port from men­tal health pro­fes­sion­als in their or­gan­i­sa­tion or else­where, when­ever needed.</p>
