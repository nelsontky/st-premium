    <p>Work­ers’ Party (WP) chair­man Sylvia Lim will not re­file her ad­journ­ment mo­tion to speak on is­sues thrown up by the high-pro­file case in­volv­ing for­mer maid Parti Liyani.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the WP said yes­ter­day it will join the de­bate af­ter Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam de­liv­ers a min­is­te­rial state­ment on the mat­ter in Par­lia­ment next month.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim had ear­lier filed an ad­journ­ment mo­tion, ti­tled Justice For All: En­hanc­ing Eq­uity In The Crim­i­nal Justice Sys­tem, to high­light as­pects of the crim­i­nal justice sys­tem and chal­lenges faced by peo­ple of less means in nav­i­gat­ing it.</p>
    <p>But the Alju­nied GRC MP was not suc­cess­ful in a bal­lot of the five ad­journ­ment mo­tions filed ahead of next week’s Par­lia­ment sit­ting. Nee Soon GRC MP Louis Ng, whose mo­tion was picked, will speak on sec­ond-hand cig­a­rette smoke in homes next Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The other three MPs – Ms Denise Phua, Dr Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah and Ms Car­rie Tan – told The Straits Times they will re-file their ad­journ­ment mo­tions for the sec­ond day of the sit­ting.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, Mr Shan­mugam said re­views by the po­lice and At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers into the han­dling of Ms Parti’s case are ex­pected to con­clude in two to three weeks’ time.</p>
    <p>He added that he in­tends to make a min­is­te­rial state­ment in Par­lia­ment next month af­ter the re­views are com­pleted, and will ad­dress ques­tions raised.</p>
    <p>In its state­ment yes­ter­day, the WP said: “Ap­pre­ci­at­ing the pre­mium on Par­lia­ment’s time, WP will co­in­cide its con­tri­bu­tion to the de­bate with the min­is­te­rial state­ment as far as prac­ti­ca­ble.”</p>
    <p>Ms Lim will there­fore not seek any fur­ther bal­lot this month for the ad­journ­ment mo­tion she had filed, it added.</p>
    <p>The WP also noted that while in­ter­nal re­views are on­go­ing, the case has high­lighted wider ques­tions about the crim­i­nal justice sys­tem, in­clud­ing the ap­pro­pri­ate ap­proaches to take to di­ag­nose and re­spond to any short­com­ings.</p>
    <p>“The strong pub­lic in­ter­est in the case, and in the un­der­ly­ing is­sue of ac­cess to justice for all, bodes well for a crit­i­cal pub­lic dis­cus­sion on how the poor and dis­ad­van­taged can ad­e­quately nav­i­gate the crim­i­nal justice sys­tem,” the party said.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti, who worked for the fam­ily of for­mer Changi Air­port Group chair­man Liew Mun Leong for nine years, was sen­tenced to jail in March last year af­ter she was found guilty of steal­ing $34,000 worth of items from the fam­ily.</p>
    <p>She suc­cess­fully ap­pealed against her con­vic­tion in a three-day hear­ing that took place be­tween Novem­ber last year and Au­gust this year.</p>
    <p>Her ac­quit­tal prompted ques­tions about the crim­i­nal justice sys­tem’s treat­ment of peo­ple who are less welloff.</p>
    <p>The news of Ms Lim’s ad­journ­ment mo­tion not get­ting picked had drawn crit­i­cism from some quar­ters, in­clud­ing Progress Sin­ga­pore Party’s Non-Con­stituency MP Leong Mun Wai who ques­tioned whether se­cond­hand smoke was deemed “more im­por­tant” than crim­i­nal justice.</p>
    <p>This prompted Speaker of Par­lia­ment Tan Chuan-Jin to ex­plain that there are var­i­ous av­enues for MPs to raise is­sues in Par­lia­ment, be­yond sub­mit­ting ad­journ­ment mo­tions. These in­clude an op­tion to put forth a sub­stan­tive mo­tion or file par­lia­men­tary ques­tions.</p>
