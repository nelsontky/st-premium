    <p>BARCELONA • Barcelona coach Ron­ald Koe­man’s as­ser­tion that his side are ca­pa­ble of mounting a ti­tle challenge will be put to the test to­day when 12th-placed Va­len­cia visit the Nou Camp.</p>
    <p>The Cata­lans have en­dured an in­con­sis­tent La Liga sea­son so far, los­ing four times al­ready in the league for 20 points, six off pace­set­ters Atletico Madrid, Real So­ciedad and Real Madrid.</p>
    <p>But with no team pulling away in a wide-open bat­tle at the top, Barca can get back into the mix.</p>
    <p>They looked back to their best on Wed­nes­day when they came from be­hind to beat So­ciedad 2-1, lead­ing a bullish Koe­man to sug­gest his team can­not be writ­ten off this early into the cam­paign.</p>
    <p>“It’s in our hands and there’s a long way to go,” he said. “We played the best half we have all sea­son, we were bril­liant with the ball and we pressed hard.”</p>
    <p>He said cap­tain Lionel Messi, Pedri and Os­car Mingueza picked up knocks in the win but ex­pects them to be fit for the week­end.</p>
    <p>Va­len­cia needed ex­tra time to see off fourth-tier side Ter­rassa 4-2 in the first round of the King’s Cup, which they won last year, on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>But mid­fielder De­nis Ch­ery­shev re­vealed the club are con­fi­dent of claim­ing an­other scalp i n the league, hav­ing beaten the likes of cham­pi­ons Real 4-1 last month.</p>
    <p>“Every game is like a fi­nal for us. We have to get our claws out against Barcelona, which we’ve al­ready done against big sides this sea­son,” said the Rus­sian. “I think that, play­ing our foot­ball and fol­low­ing what should be a con­sis­tent im­prove­ment, we will try to get bet­ter every day.”</p>
    <p>Real, who were fac­ing a cri­sis just two weeks ago af­ter their de­feat by Shakhtar Donetsk in the Cham­pi­ons League, have been resur­gent and will seek to keep up their ti­tle charge when they visit Eibar to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>The Span­ish cham­pi­ons have won their last four games in all com­pe­ti­tions, in­clud­ing the derby against Atletico last week­end, to move level on points at the top. De­spite hav­ing played two games more than their city ri­vals, con­fi­dence is run­ning through their squad, de­clared striker Karim Ben­zema.</p>
    <p>“We are on the right track,” he told the club’s TV chan­nel. “We have to con­tinue game by game.”</p>
    <p>Coach Zine­dine Zi­dane wel</p>
    <p>comes back Martin Ode­gaard from in­jury but Eden Haz­ard, Mar­i­ano Diaz and Luka Jovic all face late fit­ness tests.</p>
