    <p>Meat al­ter­na­tives con­tinue to heat up the plant-based scene in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The lat­est en­trant is Hol­land­based meat-sub­sti­tute brand The Veg­e­tar­ian Butcher. It launched yes­ter­day at the sec­ond out­let of The So­cial Kitchen, lo­cated at Jurong Bird Park.</p>
    <p>Founded in 2010 by ninth­gen­er­a­tion Dutch farmer Jaap Korteweg, The Veg­e­tar­ian Butcher is brought in by global food ser­vice provider Unilever Food So­lu­tions (UFS), which ac­quired the brand two years ago.</p>
    <p>Its al­ter­na­tive meat prod­ucts – made with soya bean, lupine beans and veg­eta­bles – is now sold in more than 30 coun­tries and at 20,000 re­tail out­lets world­wide.</p>
    <p>At The So­cial Kitchen – a so­cial en­ter­prise which pro­vides em­ploy­ment to dis­ad­van­taged in­di­vid­u­als – the plant-based menu fea­tures Western and Asian dishes. They in­clude NoChicken Truf­fle Al­fredo pasta ($13), NoBeef Ren­dang shep­herd’s pie ($12), NoChicken Nuggets in Thai sauce ($13) and NoBeef Burger with crispy onions ($14).</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the me­dia, along with the guest of honour at the launch, Speaker of Par­lia­ment Tan Chuan-Jin, had a taste of the meat­less dishes, which in­cluded Fiery Mala NoMeat­ball Pasta ($13) and NoChicken Curry Noo­dles ($12).</p>
    <p>Mr Tan, who is also the deputy chair­man of Mandai Park Hold­ings, notes that while The So­cial Kitchen helps pro­vide em­ploy­ment and a plat­form for lo­cal food brands, the in­tro­duc­tion of The Veg­e­tar­ian Butcher works from a “sus­tain­abil­ity stand­point”.</p>
    <p>“We are look­ing at di­ver­si­fy­ing our food sources. As plant-based meat gains more trac­tion and vol­ume goes up, it be­comes a very re­al­is­tic op­tion as well,” he says.</p>
    <p>Gourmet food sup­plier Angliss Sin­ga­pore is the dis­trib­u­tor for food busi­nesses look­ing to buy the prod­ucts. These in­clude NoBeef Burger ($64.01 for a 2.4kg pack), NoChicken Burger ($64.01 for a 2.4kg pack), NoChicken Nuggets ($43.41 for a 1.75kg pack) and NoChicken Chunks ($46.68 for a 1.75kg pack).</p>
    <p>Plant-based meat sausages and mince are ex­pected to be avail­able from the first quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>Mr Ivan Lu, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of UFS Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia, says: “This timely part­ner­ship be­tween The Veg­e­tar­ian Butcher and The So­cial Kitchen al­lows us to fore­ground our shared val­ues of so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity and sus­tain­abil­ity, while en­cour­ag­ing con­sumers to eat less animal meat and adopt a more plant-based life­style.</p>
    <p>“We hope to be­come the lead­ing provider of plant-based pro­teins in Sin­ga­pore and place the brand’s prod­ucts along­side tra­di­tional animal meats in butch­ers and restau­rants na­tion­wide.”</p>
    <p>The So­cial Kitchen at Jurong Bird Park, 2 Jurong Hill, opens from 8.30am to 5pm (week­days),</p>
    <p>7.30am to 6pm (week­ends).</p>
