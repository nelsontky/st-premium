    <p>In Malaysia, an emer­gency can be called once the King is sat­is­fied, based on the Prime Min­is­ter’s ad­vice, that a grave emer­gency ex­ists. This could hap­pen when the se­cu­rity, the econ­omy or public or­der in the na­tion is threat­ened.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment can be sus­pended dur­ing an emer­gency, and by-elec­tions and the gen­eral elec­tion can be post­poned, con­sti­tu­tional an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>“This will put a stop to party hop­ping and to all the se­cret tricks and horse trad­ing sur­round­ing no­con­fi­dence votes,” con­sti­tu­tional ex­pert Shad Saleem Faruqi wrote in an opin­ion piece in The Star daily on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral gov­ern­ment would then be em­pow­ered to push through poli­cies that it would nor­mally not be able to.</p>
    <p>Ques­tions over emer­gency pow­ers were raised across the coun­try yes­ter­day as Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin chaired a spe­cial Cabi­net meet­ing to de­cide on emer­gency mea­sures ahead of the Nov 6 pre­sen­ta­tion of next year’s Bud­get.</p>
    <p>De­tails of what Tan Sri Muhyid­din pre­sented to Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah in their meet­ing in the cap­i­tal of Pa­hang state is not known.</p>
    <p>What is known is that there is a big ques­tion mark over whether Mr Muhyid­din re­tains enough sup­port in Par­lia­ment. There are wor­ries that a gen­eral elec­tion could be called amid the wor­ry­ing surge in coro­n­avirus cases, should his rul­ing coali­tion col­lapse if he fails to pass gov­ern­ment spend­ing be­cause he does not have enough law­mak­ers be­hind him in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Sources say an “eco­nomic emer­gency” that the Pre­mier was seek­ing would not af­fect the daily lives of Malaysians. There would be no mil­i­tary on the streets and peo­ple can go about their busi­ness as usual.</p>
    <p>If this is true, it would be dif­fer­ent from the na­tional emer­gen­cies de­clared in the past, in­clud­ing the no­to­ri­ous one fol­low­ing deadly race ri­ots in May 1969.</p>
    <p>Since the coun­try’s in­de­pen­dence in 1957, Malaysia has seen the dec­la­ra­tion of four emer­gen­cies.</p>
    <p>The first was in Sep­tem­ber 1964, when an emer­gency was called na­tion­wide dur­ing the In­done­si­aMalaysia Con­fronta­tion, af­ter In­done­sian sol­diers landed on Malaysian soil. The Con­fronta­tion ended in Au­gust 1966.</p>
    <p>In Sep­tem­ber 1966, the Sarawak Emer­gency was de­clared, the first to be lim­ited to one state. The procla­ma­tion fol­lowed squab­bles in Sarawak linked to po­lit­i­cal moves to oust in­cum­bent chief min­is­ter Stephen Ka­long Ningkan. The cri­sis ended when his court ap­peal was re­jected in Au­gust 1968.</p>
    <p>The third emer­gency was called na­tion­wide in 1969 due to the May 13 race ri­ots. Ra­cial clashes had taken place in Kuala Lumpur, and by 8pm, po­lice de­clared a cur­few, with sol­diers and po­lice­men de­ployed. The ri­ots con­tin­ued the next day, and the gov­ern­ment de­clared a state of emer­gency on May 15 to pre­vent them from spread­ing to other parts of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The Cabi­net was re­placed by the Na­tional Op­er­a­tions Coun­cil, which gov­erned Malaysia in lieu of the elected gov­ern­ment un­til 1971, when Par­lia­ment was re­stored.</p>
    <p>News­pa­per pub­li­ca­tions were sus­pended on May 15.</p>
    <p>The fourth emer­gency was de­clared in No­vem­ber 1977 in Ke­lan­tan, and was lim­ited to one state. It was caused by a power strug­gle be­tween Umno and Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS).</p>
    <p>Then Men­teri Be­sar Mo­hamed Nasir had re­fused to re­sign, although he had lost the con­fi­dence of the PAS-led state as­sem­bly. The cri­sis ended in March 1978 with new state polls.</p>
