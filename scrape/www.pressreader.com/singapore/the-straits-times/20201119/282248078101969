    <p>A cen­tre has been launched in the China-Sin­ga­pore Suzhou In­dus­trial Park (SIP), pro­vid­ing more op­por­tu­ni­ties for biomed­i­cal firms in Sin­ga­pore to ex­pand into the Chi­nese mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search (A*Star) and SIP launched the A*Star Part­ners’ Cen­tre vir­tu­ally yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre aims to help Sin­ga­pore biomed­i­cal start-ups cap­ture op­por­tu­ni­ties in Jiangsu and the greater Yangtze River Delta re­gion, which Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice In­dra­nee Ra­jah noted has the most es­tab­lished biomed­i­cal ecosys­tem in China.</p>
    <p>Ms In­dra­nee, who is co-chair of the Sin­ga­pore-Jiangsu Co­op­er­a­tion Coun­cil, said the biomed­i­cal and pro­fes­sional ser­vices in­dus­tries are ar­eas in which Sin­ga­pore and Jiangsu can tap each other’s strengths and deepen col­lab­o­ra­tion as they de­velop their economies post-Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the 14th Sin­ga­poreJiangs­u Co­op­er­a­tion Coun­cil meet­ing yes­ter­day, Ms In­dra­nee noted that Sin­ga­pore’s biomed­i­cal in­dus­try is grow­ing rapidly, with to­tal out­put ex­pand­ing at an an­nual av­er­age of 5.2 per cent from $28.2 bil­lion in 2014 to $36.2 bil­lion last year.</p>
    <p>“Our co­op­er­a­tion in health­care and biomed is es­pe­cially im­por­tant in this era of Covid-19. Both sides can work to­gether to fa­cil­i­tate the com­mer­cial­i­sa­tion of biomed­i­cal re­search and in­no­va­tion in and through our re­spec­tive mar­kets,” she said.</p>
    <p>Nine Sin­ga­pore biomed­i­cal firms are set­ting up their op­er­a­tions in the cen­tre in SIP for a start.</p>
    <p>Firms will re­ceive cost sav­ings in equip­ment rental by ac­cess­ing the cen­tre’s fa­cil­i­ties, as well as fund­ing sup­port through the A*StarSIP Green Lane Grant. They can also tap mar­ket ac­cess pro­grammes to bet­ter un­der­stand the needs of the Chi­nese mar­ket and nav­i­gate the reg­u­la­tions there.</p>
    <p>In her speech, Ms In­dra­nee said Sin­ga­pore has man­aged to sus­tain trade and in­vest­ment mo­men­tum with Jiangsu de­spite the chal­leng­ing cir­cum­stances this year.</p>
    <p>Bi­lat­eral trade be­tween the two grew 1.6 per cent year on year to reach US$9 bil­lion (S$12 bil­lion) be­tween Jan­uary and Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Out­lin­ing how Sin­ga­pore and Jiangsu can col­lab­o­rate in pro­fes­sional ser­vices, Ms In­dra­nee em­pha­sised the im­por­tance of ac­cess to qual­ity and a broad suite of ser­vices in set­ting up an over­seas pres­ence. Moves have been made to bol­ster busi­ness ex­changes be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Jiangsu.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore, Sin­ga­pore’s Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board and the Suzhou In­dus­trial Park Ad­min­is­tra­tive Com­mit­tee signed a mem­o­ran­dum of un­der­stand­ing (MOU) to fa­cil­i­tate more part­ner­ships be­tween Sin­ga­pore pro­fes­sional ser­vices firms and Chi­nese en­ter­prises.</p>
    <p>This will al­low lo­cal firms to ex­plore new op­por­tu­ni­ties in the Yangtze River Delta re­gion, and also al­low Chi­nese firms to use Sin­ga­pore as a launch pad to broaden their reach in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>An­other 10 MOUs were also signed at the meet­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
