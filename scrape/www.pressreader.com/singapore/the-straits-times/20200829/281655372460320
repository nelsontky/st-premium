    <p>Ac­co­lades poured in glob­ally yes­ter­day as Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe called time on his ten­ure as the leader of the world’s third-largest econ­omy, with lead­ers say­ing they hoped for his speedy recovery from a flare-up of a chronic con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>China and South Korea, whose ties with Ja­pan have blown hot and cold over is­sues such as history and ter­ri­tory dis­putes, said they will con­tinue to work with the new gov­ern­ment to fos­ter friendly ties.</p>
    <p>In Bei­jing, Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian said: “This is an in­ter­nal af­fair of Ja­pan and we will not comment. China and Ja­pan are close neigh­bours, and China is will­ing to work with Ja­pan to con­tinue to pro­mote the devel­op­ment of China-Ja­pan re­la­tions.”</p>
    <p>A state visit by Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, sched­uled for April, had been post­poned due to Covid-19, with no new date in sight.</p>
    <p>Tokyo has re­cently been tak­ing a stronger tone against Bei­jing over its mil­i­tary ex­pan­sion­ism in both the East China and South China seas, as well as over Hong Kong, and Mr Abe’s Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party has urged that the state visit be can­celled.</p>
    <p>In South Korea, pres­i­den­tial Blue House spokesman Kang Min-seok said Seoul re­grets the res­ig­na­tion.</p>
    <p>With­out elab­o­rat­ing, he cred­ited Mr Abe for hav­ing “long played many roles for the devel­op­ment of South Korea-Ja­pan re­la­tions”, and for “var­i­ous mean­ing­ful ac­com­plish­ments” as Ja­pan’s long­est-serv­ing prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Ties be­tween the two neigh­bours have rapidly chilled over wartime labour, ter­ri­tory and trade dis­putes.</p>
    <p>Mr Kwon Tae-shin, vice-chair­man of busi­ness lobby Fed­er­a­tion of Korean In­dus­tries, said he hoped bi­lat­eral ties will im­prove un­der a new Ja­panese leader.</p>
    <p>How­ever, as­so­ci­ate pro­fes­sor of in­ter­na­tional stud­ies Leif-Eric Easley of Ewha Wo­mans Uni­ver­sity in Seoul does not see this as a cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>“But there will be an op­por­tu­nity for Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in’s ad­min­is­tra­tion to im­prove re­la­tions with lit­tle po­lit­i­cal cost be­cause do­ing so will not be seen as a con­ces­sion to Mr Abe,” he said, not­ing that the South Korean pub­lic blames Mr Abe for strained bi­lat­eral ties.</p>
    <p>In Russia, with which Ja­pan also has a ter­ri­to­rial dis­pute, Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov hailed Mr Abe’s “in­valu­able con­tri­bu­tion to the devel­op­ment of bi­lat­eral Rus­sian-Ja­panese re­la­tions”.</p>
    <p>Get-well wishes have also poured in. In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee chief Thomas Bach praised Mr</p>
    <p>Abe for be­ing a “strong part­ner who al­ways stood up for the in­ter­ests of Ja­pan and who at the same time could al­ways be trusted”.</p>
    <p>“In this way, we were able to find so­lu­tions, even in the most dif­fi­cult cir­cum­stances of the Covid-19 pan­demic, which al­low his vi­sion for Ja­pan to still come true, even if with one year’s de­lay,” he said, re­fer­ring to the post­pone­ment of the Olympic Games to next year.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said he was sorry to learn of Mr Abe’s res­ig­na­tion, and wished him a good recovery.</p>
    <p>“Un­der his lead­er­ship, our bi­lat­eral re­la­tions have deep­ened,” PM Lee said, cit­ing Mr Abe’s crit­i­cal role in push­ing the re­vised Tran­sPa­cific Part­ner­ship trade pact past the fin­ish­ing line af­ter the United States’ with­drawal.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son de­scribed Mr Abe as “a man of in­tegrity and wis­dom”. “He has ad­vo­cated for the re­gion’s pros­per­ity and sta­bil­ity, bring­ing his lead­er­ship as an ex­pe­ri­enced states­man of the first or­der,” Mr Mor­ri­son said.</p>
    <p>Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel said she re­grets Mr Abe’s res­ig­na­tion and hailed his “fight for mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism”.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo, In­dian Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi and Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son also thanked Mr Abe for deep­en­ing ties with their re­spec­tive na­tions.</p>
    <p>Tai­wanese Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing­wen also hailed his friend­li­ness to­wards Tai­wan on pol­icy as well as the rights and in­ter­ests of its peo­ple.</p>
