    <p>For more than 27 years, Mr Tim Tan worked at an oil and gas multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tion, ris­ing to the po­si­tion of pro­duc­tion and plan­ning man­ager. Just over a year ago, the 56-year-old was re­trenched fol­low­ing the firm’s re­struc­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>His worry about get­ting another job at his age mounted as job ap­pli­ca­tions he sent out, one af­ter another, were re­jected.</p>
    <p>“Nat­u­rally, I was ap­pre­hen­sive be­cause I have friends in sim­i­lar cir­cum­stances who faced much dif­fi­culty in land­ing another job af­ter be­ing laid off,” says Mr Tan, who had man­aged more than a dozen pro­duc­tion and plan­ning ex­ec­u­tives.</p>
    <p>“Re­jec­tions were com­mon. I was turned away from many jobs even though I met the job re­quire­ments.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter a month of job hunt­ing, he sought help from Work­force Sin­ga­pore’s Ca­reers Con­nect. This in­volved con­sult­ing a ca­reer coach and at­tend­ing work­shops, where he met a con­sul­tant who re­ferred him to prospec­tive em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, in Fe­bru­ary this year, he was of­fered an op­er­a­tions man­ager role by 3D Me­tal­forge, a small and medium-sized en­ter­prise spe­cial­is­ing in 3D metal print­ing.</p>
    <p>He was then en­rolled in a six­month pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­gramme for ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing en­gi­neers to help him ease into his new role and pick up new skills, such as se­lec­tive laser melt­ing.</p>
    <p>He man­ages a team of en­gi­neers and op­er­a­tions spe­cial­ists and is re­spon­si­ble for the firm’s daily man­u­fac­tur­ing op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>A TRY­ING TIME</p>
    <p>Mr Tan re­calls the pain of leav­ing his pre­vi­ous com­pany not know­ing what was to come. It was his first job af­ter grad­u­at­ing with a mas­ter’s in ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing tech­nolo­gies from the Uni­ver­sity of Manch­ester in 1992.</p>
    <p>“It was a very sad day for me as the com­pany was like a sec­ond home and the col­leagues were like fam­ily,” he says.</p>
    <p>That pe­riod was a “try­ing time” for his fam­ily, re­calls the father of two chil­dren aged 22 and 27. The younger child had just en­tered uni­ver­sity when he was laid off and his 58-year-old home­maker wife had to work part-time as a ser­vice crew mem­ber in the food and bev­er­age sec­tor and wait on ta­bles to help with the fam­ily’s fi­nances.</p>
    <p>“It was a tough sit­u­a­tion, es­pe­cially when my in­come dropped to zero but ex­penses re­mained as be­fore. I was con­stantly wor­ried about pro­vid­ing for them,” he re­veals.</p>
    <p>Thank­fully, his cur­rent firm was im­pressed by his wealth of ex­peri</p>
    <p>ence, man­age­rial skills and ap­ti­tude to learn.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan, whose ex­per­tise was in pre­ci­sion en­gi­neer­ing within the oil and gas in­dus­try, had to face a steep learn­ing curve as he tran­sited from a tra­di­tional man­u­fac­tur­ing back­ground to the emerg­ing “ad­di­tive” man­u­fac­tur­ing in­dus­try, which in­cludes us­ing new tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>I was ap­pre­hen­sive be­cause I have friends in sim­i­lar cir­cum­stances who faced much dif­fi­culty in land­ing another job af­ter be­ing laid off. Re­jec­tions were com­mon. I was turned away for many jobs even though I met the job re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>A MEN­TOR NOW</p>
    <p>How­ever, he be­lieves that the job ex­pec­ta­tions af­fect­ing work­ers to­day are no dif­fer­ent from when he started out in his pre­vi­ous oil and gas job.</p>
    <p>Traits such as a good work­ing at­ti­tude and a will­ing­ness to learn and take on new re­spon­si­bil­i­ties are still im­por­tant for a job, he adds.</p>
    <p>Look­ing back, Mr Tan, who now men­tors new trainees and in­terns, says his ca­reer switch was a nec­es­sary one as it al­lowed him to move for­ward and sup­port his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“Tak­ing this step has al­lowed me the op­por­tu­nity to learn new things and gain new ex­pe­ri­ences,” he de­clares.</p>
