    <p>BEI­JING • Mr Zhong Shan­shan is a pri­vate bil­lion­aire who is rarely quoted in the press.</p>
    <p>Now, af­ter an im­prob­a­ble ca­reer span­ning jour­nal­ism, mushroom farm­ing and health­care, he has be­come Asia’s rich­est per­son, eclips­ing In­dia’s Mukesh Am­bani and a group of Chi­nese tech ti­tans, in­clud­ing Mr Jack Ma.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhong’s net worth surged US$70.9 bil­lion last year to US$77.8 bil­lion (S$102.8 bil­lion), mak­ing him the 11th-rich­est per­son on the planet, ac­cord­ing to the Bloomberg Bil­lion­aires In­dex.</p>
    <p>It is one of the fastest ac­cu­mu­la­tions of wealth in his­tory, and all the more re­mark­able con­sid­er­ing that un­til last year, he was lit­tle known out­side of China.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhong, 66, is not in­volved in pol­i­tics and his busi­ness in­ter­ests are not en­twined with those of other rich fam­i­lies such as prop­erty ty­coons, which is why he is known lo­cally as the “Lone Wolf”.</p>
    <p>He owes his suc­cess to two un­re­lated fields. He took Covid-19 vac­cine maker Bei­jing Wan­tai Bi­o­log­i­cal Phar­macy En­ter­prise pub­lic last April, then months later, bot­tled-water maker Nongfu Spring, another of his com­pa­nies, be­came one of Hong Kong’s hottest list­ings.</p>
    <p>Nongfu shares have jumped 155 per cent since their de­but, and Wan­tai’s are up more than 2,000 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Am­bani has also had an ex­tra­or­di­nary year, strik­ing deals to trans­form his con­glom­er­ate Re­liance In­dus­tries into a tech­nol­ogy and e-com­merce ti­tan, and see­ing his for­tune surge US$18.3 bil­lion to US$76.9 bil­lion (S$101.6 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>While Mr Am­bani was at one point the world’s fourth-rich­est per­son, shares of Re­liance have stalled as he comes un­der pres­sure to de­liver on the dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion he has promised.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Nongfu stock hit a peak this week af­ter Cit­i­group an­a­lysts said the com­pany has so­lid­i­fied its mar­ket dom­i­nance and en­joys am­ple cash flow. And Wan­tai is among those de­vel­op­ing a Covid-19 vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhong has also climbed the ranks as China’s tech com­pa­nies have tum­bled with in­creased gov­ern­ment scru­tiny.</p>
    <p>Mr Jack Ma, Asia’s rich­est per­son be­fore Mr Am­bani took over last year, is now worth US$51.2 bil­lion (S$67.6 bil­lion), down from a high of US$61.7 bil­lion last Oc­to­ber.</p>
