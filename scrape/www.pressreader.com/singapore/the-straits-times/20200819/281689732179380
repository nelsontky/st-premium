    <p>A 39-year-old Sin­ga­porean man who works at a bus de­pot in a “non­pub­lic fac­ing” role is the sole com­mu­nity case an­nounced by the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said the case is cur­rently un­linked, and added that his job “does not en­tail in­ter­ac­tion with com­muters and bus cap­tains”.</p>
    <p>The man was de­tected as part of the min­istry’s screen­ing of all staff in the pub­lic bus in­dus­try who work at de­pots and in­ter­changes.</p>
    <p>MOH said it has com­pleted test­ing more than 14,800 staff and close con­tacts of the cases be­tween July 23 and Satur­day, and five re­sults are pend­ing.</p>
    <p>Of those tested, 10 had tested pos­i­tive us­ing the poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) test, in­clud­ing the three ini­tial cases de­tected at the Bukit Pan­jang In­te­grated Trans­port Hub last month.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said it also con­ducted sero­log­i­cal tests for the 10 to de­ter­mine if they had cur­rent or past in­fec­tions. Seven re­sults have come back pos­i­tive, which in­di­cate likely past in­fec­tion, it added.</p>
    <p>There were also two im­ported cases among the 100 new cases re­ported yes­ter­day – a per­ma­nent res­i­dent aged 32 and a de­pen­dant’s pass holder aged 30, who re­turned to Sin­ga­pore from In­dia on Aug 6 and Aug 10 re­spec­tively. Both women tested pos­i­tive on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Kal­lang Wave Mall, Seoul Gar­den at Bugis Junc­tion and a McDonald’s out­let at Bukit Ba­tok Cen­tral have been added to the list of places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were still in­fec­tious. Other places new to the list yes­ter­day were Wan Shun Food­court at 888 Plaza and SBCD Korean Tofu House at Guoco Tower.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 97 new cases an­nounced yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 55,938.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of two cases per day in the past two weeks. The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of one case per day.</p>
    <p>With 183 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 52,518 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered. A to­tal of 88 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, while 3,290 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. None is in in­ten­sive care.</p>
