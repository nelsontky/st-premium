    <p>As the world gears up for mass vac­ci­na­tions and hopes rise for a re­turn to nor­malcy, cli­mate change rep­re­sents a longer-term and po­ten­tially far more dev­as­tat­ing cri­sis re­quir­ing a global re­sponse as well.</p>
    <p>This year’s ex­treme weather and its im­pact on mil­lions of peo­ple is a re­minder that the fight against cli­mate change needs to bring peo­ple and gov­ern­ments as well as hu­man in­ge­nu­ity to­gether.</p>
    <p>As Covid-19 rav­aged liveli­hoods and economies this year, an­other cri­sis piled on more mis­ery, re­mind­ing the world that even when the pan­demic even­tu­ally sub­sides, a larger cri­sis re­mains for mankind to tackle: cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>The world is steadily get­ting hot­ter and this has tipped into danger­ous ter­ri­tory. Warmer oceans and a hot­ter at­mos­phere are chang­ing weather pat­terns and fu­elling more ex­treme heat­waves, storms and floods, as well as longer droughts and dead­lier wild­fires.</p>
    <p>As mankind pumps more plan­et­warm­ing car­bon diox­ide into the at­mos­phere through the burn­ing of fos­sil fu­els, de­for­esta­tion and agri­cul­ture, it is giv­ing the world’s weather an ex­tra kick.</p>
    <p>This year, fright­en­ing weather ex­tremes were felt by hun­dreds of mil­lions of peo­ple in na­tions rich and poor. It has been a record­breaker for wild­fires, floods and storms, leav­ing swathes of de­struc­tion and adding to the suf­fer­ing of many al­ready reel­ing from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>This year is set to be the third­warmest on record, ac­cord­ing to the United Na­tions’ World Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Or­gan­i­sa­tion, with the past six years, in­clud­ing 2020, likely to be the warm­est ones recorded.</p>
    <p>FIRES</p>
    <p>In Aus­tralia, this year con­tin­ued to see last year’s ex­tremes of heat and fire. In south­ern Vic­to­ria state, thou­sands of ter­ri­fied hol­i­day­mak­ers spent the New Year camped on beaches as wild­fires driven by record droughts and heat­waves swept through coastal towns, in­clud­ing Mal­la­coota where many peo­ple were stranded. The only safe way out was a ma­jor res­cue launched by the navy.</p>
    <p>It was just part of the drama of a record fire sea­son in eastern Aus­tralia. Thou­sands of fires left</p>
    <p>Suc­ces­sion of storms that struck the Philip­pines, in­clud­ing Typhoon Goni, one of the strong­est storms this year. Goni smashed into Catan­d­u­anes is­land as a max­i­mum Cat­e­gory 5 storm on Nov 1. Less than two weeks later, Typhoon Vamco hit, killing 101 peo­ple. dozens dead and burned more than 18 mil­lion ha. Weeks of chok­ing smoke haze sick­ened thou­sands in Syd­ney and Can­berra. Af­ter the first blazes started in mid-2019, the last of them were fi­nally ex­tin­guished in March this year.</p>
    <p>Ex­treme weather also fu­elled a record fire sea­son in Cal­i­for­nia, while there were huge blazes in Ore­gon and Wash­ing­ton states as well. In Cal­i­for­nia alone, fires burned through nearly 1.8 mil­lion ha, de­stroy­ing thou­sands of homes and other struc­tures and killing 33 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>At the height of one of the ma­jor blazes, an eerie or­ange glow en­veloped San Fran­cisco, as if in­di­cat­ing that the city, too, was about to be con­sumed.</p>
    <p>Huge blazes tore through Arc­tic forests and Brazil as well.</p>
    <p>This year’s fire sea­son was the worst in a decade in terms of the num­ber of blazes, data from Brazil’s Na­tional In­sti­tute for Space Re­search shows. De­for­esta­tion in Brazil also rose to a 12-year high.</p>
    <p>STORMS</p>
    <p>As with fires, 2020 will be re­mem</p>
    <p>bered for its seem­ingly end­less suc­ces­sion of storms in the At­lantic and Western Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>With 30 named storms, the At­lantic hur­ri­cane sea­son that ended on Nov 30 was the busiest on record. Twelve of those storms hit the United States, in­clud­ing nine that struck the US Gulf Coast, caus­ing bil­lions of dol­lars in dam­age in</p>
    <p>back-to-back dis­as­ters that wiped some towns off the map.</p>
    <p>Last month, Hur­ri­cane Eta and then the more pow­er­ful Iota slammed into Cen­tral Amer­ica, flat­ten­ing towns and trig­ger­ing floods and land­slides in which scores died.</p>
    <p>A suc­ces­sion of storms – 22 in all – struck the Philip­pines, in­clud­ing</p>
    <p>Typhoon Goni, one of the strong­est storms this year. Goni smashed into Catan­d­u­anes is­land as a max­i­mum Cat­e­gory 5 storm on Nov 1. Less than two weeks later, Typhoon Vamco hit, killing 101 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Vamco gath­ered dev­as­tat­ing strength as it ap­proached the ar­chi­pel­ago and set off mas­sive flood­ing that paral­ysed nearly all of Metro</p>
    <p>poli­tan Manila.</p>
    <p>At least 166 died in the Philip­pines this year as a re­sult of storms. The Na­tional Disas­ter Risk Re­duc­tion Man­age­ment Coun­cil es­ti­mated that the storms cost at least 41.7 bil­lion pe­sos (S$1.2 bil­lion) in dam­age to farm­lands and in­fra­struc­ture, and dis­placed close to eight mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Be­tween Oc­to­ber and Novem­ber, a series of storms struck Viet­nam, trig­ger­ing se­vere flood­ing and land­slides that left dozens dead and miss­ing. Typhoon Molave hit cen­tral Viet­nam in late Oc­to­ber, greatly ex­ac­er­bat­ing al­ready se­vere flood­ing in the area.</p>
    <p>The Unesco her­itage sites of Hoi An and Hue’s Im­pe­rial Ci­tadel</p>
    <p>were also dam­aged.</p>
    <p>This month, Cy­clone Yasa, one of the strong­est storms in the South Pa­cific, struck Fiji, ru­in­ing the liveli­hoods of thou­sands and trig­ger­ing a ma­jor aid cam­paign.</p>
    <p>FLOODS</p>
    <p>Se­vere floods struck China, Ja­pan</p>
    <p>and In­dia this year.</p>
    <p>The sum­mer mon­soon sea­son trig­gered his­toric rain­fall in China from June. News out­lets re­ported that by Septem­ber, the coun­try had ex­pe­ri­enced at least 21 large-scale floods – the most since 1996. Heavy rain lashed 28 out of 31 prov­inces, caus­ing 214.3 bil­lion yuan (S$43.6 bil­lion) in eco­nomic losses, which the au­thor­i­ties said was 27 per cent higher than the an­nual av­er­age over the past five years.</p>
    <p>More than 70.47 mil­lion peo­ple were af­fected, ac­cord­ing to fig­ures from China’s Min­istry of Emer­gency Man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of peo­ple died across South Asia in se­vere mon­soon floods, par­tic­u­larly in Nepal, As­sam in In­dia, and Bangladesh. Mil­lions were af­fected and large ar­eas of crops were dam­aged.</p>
    <p>In May, pow­er­ful Cy­clone Am­phan also struck eastern In­dia. The West Ben­gal state gov­ern­ment said 98 peo­ple died and es­ti­mated storm and flood dam­age at about 1.02 tril­lion ru­pees (S$18.4 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>In July, tor­ren­tial rain in south­west­ern and cen­tral Ja­pan caused flood­ing and land­slides, killing over 60 peo­ple and lead­ing to an evac­u­a­tion order for mil­lions of peo­ple.</p>
