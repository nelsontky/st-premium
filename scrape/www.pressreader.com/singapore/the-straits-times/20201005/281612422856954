    <p>A ma­jor traf­fic junc­tion in Novena will be re­con­fig­ured from Oct 17 and two pedes­trian un­der­passes nearby closed by the sec­ond quar­ter of next year, to make way for the con­struc­tion of ex­press­way tun­nels.</p>
    <p>The tem­po­rary changes to build the North-South Cor­ri­dor could mean longer trav­el­ling times for mo­torists and pedes­tri­ans in the area un­til at least late-2022.</p>
    <p>The Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) last Fri­day re­vealed de­tails of the changes, which will af­fect the junc­tion of Thom­son Road with New­ton Road and Moul­mein Road.</p>
    <p>Works to reconfigur­e the roads in the area will start at 8pm on Oct 17 and last till 10am the next day. Traf­fic on all sides will re­main pass­able dur­ing this time.</p>
    <p>The LTA will post traf­fic mar­shals for a week af­ter the changes are made to di­rect traf­fic and make sure there are clear guid­ing signs.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent cross junc­tion of Thom­son Road, New­ton Road and Moul­mein Road will be split into two T-junc­tions – one in­ter­sect­ing Thom­son Road and New­ton Road, and one in­ter­sect­ing Thom­son Road and Moul­mein Road.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, those trav­el­ling along Thom­son Road could have their jour­neys take up to 2.5 minutes longer dur­ing peak hours, as they will now have one more traf­fic light to con­tend with.</p>
    <p>Those driv­ing be­tween New­ton Road and Moul­mein Road should also ex­pect up to five minutes of de­lay with the changes.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, a mo­torist who can cur­rently drive through the junc­tion to get from Moul­mein Road to New­ton Road will now have to make a right turn onto Thom­son Road, be­fore tak­ing the left-turn slip road to­wards New­ton Road.</p>
    <p>The bus stop out­side Ve­loc­ity@Novena Square will be moved 70m away to Royal Square@Novena to fa­cil­i­tate con­struc­tion from Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The un­der­pass link­ing Novena MRT sta­tion and Gold­hill Cen­tre will be closed in the first quar­ter of next year, the LTA said.</p>
    <p>A tem­po­rary over­head bridge to link the two lo­ca­tions will be built in the sec­ond quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, the un­der­pass link­ing Ve­loc­ity@Novena Square and Rev­enue House will be closed in the sec­ond quar­ter of next year and re­placed with an­other tem­po­rary over­head bridge.</p>
    <p>Pedes­tri­ans should also ex­pect two to three ex­tra minutes for their jour­neys as a re­sult. LTA said that they can still use the cross­ings on Thom­son Road.</p>
    <p>The 21.5km North-South Cor­ri­dor (NSC) will run from Wood­lands in the north to the city area.</p>
    <p>The LTA is still tar­get­ing to com­plete the dual three-lane ex­press­way in 2026, though it said it is still re­view­ing the im­pact of Covid-19 on its var­i­ous projects.</p>
    <p>Aimed at re­liev­ing the in­creas­ing traf­fic be­tween the north and city cen­tre, the project will also sup­port Sin­ga­pore’s car-lite vi­sion by hav­ing ded­i­cated and con­tin­u­ous bus lanes and cy­cling routes.</p>
    <p>Said the LTA: “Dur­ing con­struc­tion of the NSC tun­nel, LTA will con­tinue to en­sure pedes­trian safety.”</p>
    <p>It will build cov­ered linkways and larger wait­ing ar­eas at cross­ings in the Novena area, as well as in­stall clear signs to re­di­rect pedes­tri­ans.</p>
