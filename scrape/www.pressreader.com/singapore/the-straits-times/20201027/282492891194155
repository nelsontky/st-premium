    <p>Ac­tor Peter Yu says he is open to ap­pear­ing on the pro­grammes hosted by his for­mer wife, tele­vi­sion host Quan Yifeng, though he has not been in­vited so far.</p>
    <p>Yu was asked about this when he spoke to the me­dia on Satur­day at One Far­rer Ho­tel, where he was film­ing Me­di­a­corp English­language drama Re­union.</p>
    <p>On whether he might ap­pear on Quan’s talk show Hear U Out, or her cook­ing show YiFong And Eleanor’s Kitchen, Yu replied that he has not been asked, but did not mind mak­ing an ap­pear­ance for work.</p>
    <p>He qual­i­fied jok­ingly: “Please pay me more, I want to sup­port my fam­ily.”</p>
    <p>Yu, 52, and Quan, 46, di­vorced in 2008 and their daugh­ter, Eleanor Lee, turned 21 this month. He has since re­mar­ried and has two young sons, Is­rael and Chris­tian.</p>
    <p>Re­porters also asked him about ru­mours re­gard­ing Quan fall­ing out with her long-time best friend Addy Lee, who is a famed celebrity hair­styl­ist and the god­fa­ther of Quan’s daugh­ter. Quan later de­nied that they have fallen out.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to the con­tro­versy, Yu told Lianhe Za­obao: “I have said ev­ery­thing that should be said and kept quiet about ev­ery­thing that should be kept quiet about.</p>
    <p>“You are not tired of lis­ten­ing, but I am tired of com­ment­ing.”</p>
    <p>Yu, who is also work­ing as a prop­erty agent and pri­vate-hire driver, also told the me­dia about his plans to move from his three-room flat in Ang Mo Kio to a larger four-room flat in the same area.</p>
    <p>He said he has al­ready sold his old flat and has bud­geted about $80,000 to $100,000 for ren­o­vat­ing his new apart­ment.</p>
    <p>As for his new show, Yu will be act­ing along­side the­atre vet­eran Lim Kay Tong. Other cast mem­bers in Re­union in­clude Ch­eryl Chou, Joshua Lim and Chen Yixi.</p>
