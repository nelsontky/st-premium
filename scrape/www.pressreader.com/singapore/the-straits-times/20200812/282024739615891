    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the House­hold Ex­pen­di­ture Sur­vey 2017/2018, fam­i­lies in Sin­ga­pore spent $1.4 bil­lion on tu­ition (Fam­i­lies spent $1.4b on ex­tra tu­ition for chil­dren last year, Sept 7, 2019).</p>
    <p>There are about 1,000 Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion-reg­is­tered tu­ition agen­cies as of this year.</p>
    <p>As in many other Asian coun­tries, Sin­ga­pore­ans put a lot of em­pha­sis on aca­demic achieve­ment, and shell out a lot of money in the hope of help­ing their chil­dren achieve aca­demic ex­cel­lence.</p>
    <p>Some tu­ition agen­cies claim to have pro­duced “star” stu­dents who have aced national ex­am­i­na­tions. I know of agen­cies which claim to have a spe­cial “for­mula” to teach and boost the per­for­mance of their stu­dents in English. Quite of­ten, these claims bor­der on the lu­di­crous and should be stopped.</p>
    <p>Tu­ition agen­cies are also very cre­ative in the way they col­lect their fees. The norm is to book a pack­age of tu­ition classes over six months or more. The fees are col­lected up­front. On top of that, I had to pay a de­posit even though full pay­ment had been made.</p>
    <p>Even with such un­fair prac­tices, par­ents con­tinue to pay in the hope that their chil­dren may gain some­thing from the classes.</p>
    <p>Class sizes are never spec­i­fied, and it would seem log­i­cal for tu­ition agen­cies to take in as many stu­dents as pos­si­ble to max­imise rev­enue.</p>
    <p>I hope the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties will play a big­ger role to reg­u­late the tu­ition in­dus­try.</p>
