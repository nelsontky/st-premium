    <p>CHAR­LOTTE • Brook­lyn Nets rookie head coach Steve Nash has a mes­sage to the crit­ics: Cool it with the ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>With Kevin Du­rant back on the court after 18 months and play­ing in tan­dem with fel­low All-Star Kyrie Irv­ing, many ex­perts have tipped the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) team as a cham­pi­onship con­tender.</p>
    <p>The hype built up after they won their first two reg­u­lar-sea­son games by at least 20 points, the first team since the 2008-09 Los An­ge­les Lak­ers to do so.</p>
    <p>But Nash claimed the Nets, who have never won the NBA ti­tle, were given a re­minder that it is still early days after their come­back from a 16-point deficit fell short in a 106-104 loss at the Char­lotte Hor­nets on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Du­rant and Irv­ing put to­gether an­other dy­namic scor­ing dis­play with 29 and 25 points re­spec­tively but it was not enough to over­come the hosts.</p>
    <p>Char­lotte, who last qual­i­fied for the post-sea­son in 2015-16, were paced by 28 points from close-sea­son ac­qui­si­tion Gor­don Hay­ward.</p>
    <p>Nash aims to take the les­son on board.</p>
    <p>“It’s a long sea­son and a long process, less than 30 days in here,” the 46-year-old said. “We’re still try­ing to find our­selves and fig­ure out who we are. They’ve (Du­rant and Irv­ing) been ex­cep­tional thus far with their ef­fort, their en­gage­ment.</p>
    <p>“Tonight, was a lit­tle bit of a let­down but that’s go­ing to hap­pen.</p>
    <p>“When you’re play­ing bas­ket­ball, you can’t be per­fect ev­ery time.”</p>
    <p>Still there are plenty of pos­i­tives to take, with Du­rant and Irv­ing the first duo in Nets his­tory to score at least 20 points in each of the team’s first three games.</p>
    <p>The more time Du­rant spends on court, the more he is get­ting up to speed, so much so that he feels ready to play “back-to-backs”.</p>
    <p>The for­ward be­lieves the Char­lotte up­set is ben­e­fi­cial for the team’s men­tal­ity after he missed a game-ty­ing fade­away with seven sec­onds re­main­ing.</p>
    <p>“I thought it was go­ing in,” Du­rant said. “It looked good when it left my hands. I’m sure we’ll get that sit­u­a­tion back again through­out the sea­son and I can cap­i­talise on it again. It was good to play in a fourth-quar­ter game again. Play a game that we had to, you know, fight up­hill and claw back to get back into the game.”</p>
    <p>The only con­cern for Brook­lyn was a third-quar­ter in­jury to start­ing guard Spencer Din­wid­die. The Nets said he suf­fered a knee strain but team­mate Jar­rett Allen is hop­ing he will not be out for long.</p>
    <p>“When Spencer is go­ing, he can’t be stopped,” the cen­tre said. “Even off the court, ev­ery­one loves hav­ing Spencer around. His en­ergy, just his per­son­al­ity is great in the locker room. I don’t know what’s hap­pen­ing with him... he’s a strong dude – he’ll try and come back as soon as pos­si­ble.”</p>
