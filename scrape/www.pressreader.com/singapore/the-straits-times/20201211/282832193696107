    <p>One taste of the Teochew fish soup at Teochew Fish Por­ridge Da Pai</p>
    <p>Dang and you will find it hard to go back to other stalls.</p>
    <p>The soup here, made from chicken bone broth, is cloudy and packed with flavour. It has gen­er­ous heaps of dried flat­fish and fried gar­lic bits. No monosodium glu­ta­mate is added.</p>
    <p>The stall uses pre­mium air-flown, wild-caught fish like red grouper, so the price may seem steep, but it is well worth pay­ing for.</p>
    <p>If you are lucky, you may even get choices of fish such as gi­ant grouper and mouse grouper, but these are usu­ally snapped up quickly and re­served by reg­u­lar cus­tomers in the know.</p>
    <p>Go for the clay­pot ver­sion (above) of the fish soup, which is priced at $8 for 100g of red grouper, $15 for 190g and $20 for 250g. For two peo­ple, $20 is am­ple.</p>
    <p>De­pend­ing on avail­abil­ity, you can opt for the ad­di­tion of fish milt or fish roe from $2. I or­dered an ad­di­tional $2 worth of fish maw, but did not find it to my lik­ing as it was not suf­fi­ciently cooked through.</p>
    <p>The one stel­lar dish that will keep me go­ing back is the Pig’s Trot­ter Jelly ($8), a her­itage dish that is dif­fi­cult to find here. The jelly, formed from the nat­u­ral gelatin in the pork skin, has a melt-in-the-mouth tex­ture.</p>
    <p>Also, or­der the yam rice ($1.50), which is aro­matic with shal­lots, dried mush­room and dried prawns. Though the yam is cut into tiny cubes, you can taste its pow­dery tex­ture in the rice. WHERE Teochew Fish Por­ridge Da Pai Dang, 01-906, Block 631</p>
