    <p>Other parts of the world may be ex­pe­ri­enc­ing scorch­ing sum­mers but Sin­ga­pore­ans have been don­ning rainy-day gear.</p>
    <p>Rain­fall and a par­tic­u­larly wet June have brought cooler weather.</p>
    <p>This is ex­pected to per­sist through­out this month, with the mer­cury dipping to 22 deg C on some days and more rain­fall than in the past fort­night, the weath­er­man said last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Cli­mate ex­perts, how­ever, have pointed out that the cool mid-year weather Sin­ga­pore is see­ing is not un­usual. That be­ing the case, this June was still the wettest in the last decade and one of the coolest in the last 20 years.</p>
    <p>The to­tal rain­fall of 233.8mm ex­ceeded the 213mm recorded in June 2011, and this June’s mean tem­per­a­ture of 28.1 deg C was 0.2 deg C lower than the long-term June av­er­age.</p>
    <p>Last month also saw flash floods in places in­clud­ing Jurong Town Hall Road and New Up­per Changi Road, and video clips on­line showed some ve­hi­cles par­tially sub­merged near Changi Fire Sta­tion.</p>
    <p>Fe­bru­ary and June are usu­ally the dri­est months of the year, and monthly rain­fall – ex­cept for Jan­uary, Fe­bru­ary and June – has in­creased from what was recorded be­tween 1875 and 2017, said Pro­fes­sor Benjamin Hor­ton, di­rec­tor of the Earth Ob­ser­va­tory of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Even so, some years wit­nessed tor­ren­tial down­pours dur­ing June.</p>
    <p>On June 16, 2010, the Or­chard Road area was hit with the worst flash floods since 1984.</p>
    <p>Shops at Liat Tow­ers and the Lucky Plaza base­ment were flooded, caus­ing mil­lions of dol­lars in dam­age.</p>
    <p>June 2010’s to­tal rain­fall was 240.5mm, a 20-year high.</p>
    <p>But the wet weather did not stop then, as the fol­low­ing month recorded even more rain. The to­tal rain­fall for July 2010 was 298.5mm, also a 20-year high.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency’s (NEA) 2010 An­nual Weather Re­view, nat­u­ral causes for the June 16 tor­rent in­cluded an in­tense south-west mon­soon and a strong and slow-mov­ing Su­ma­tra squall that lin­gered over the city area for over an hour.</p>
    <p>Those ex­treme weather con­di­tions arose while La Nina – a cli­mate phe­nom­e­non that brings cooler weather and more rain­fall to the re­gion – was brew­ing.</p>
    <p>To an ex­tent, the weather for June and July in 2010 mir­rors the weather of these two months this year.</p>
    <p>Weather and cli­mate sci­en­tist Koh Tieh Yong said the cooler and wet­ter weather in June and July this year is par­tially caused by a cooler sea sur­face and higher sur­face pres­sure in the cen­tral trop­i­cal Pa­cific Ocean.</p>
    <p>Since winds move from ar­eas of high pres­sure to ar­eas of low pres­sure, moist winds con­verged in equa­to­rial South-east Asia, caus­ing more rain.</p>
    <p>Look­ing at rain­fall and mean tem­per­a­ture data for June and July over the past 20 years, there is a clear os­cil­lat­ing rhythm where tem­per­a­ture and rain­fall peak in some years and fall in other years, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Koh, who is also a fac­ulty mem­ber at the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences.</p>
    <p>The peaks and falls are par­tially in­flu­enced by La Nina and its si­b­ling, El Nino, which brings drier and hot­ter weather to the re­gion and even droughts at times. La Nina could oc­cur later this year and cli­mate sci­en­tists are look­ing out for more ev­i­dence to con­firm this.</p>
    <p>They also cau­tion against link­ing the cool June and July weather this year to cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>“Although June’s rain­fall sets a 10-year record for weather, a decade is a brief mo­ment where cli­mate is con­cerned. Cli­mate refers to long-term av­er­ages and trends, usu­ally over 30 to 100 years,” said Prof Koh.</p>
    <p>NEA’s Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Ser­vice Sin­ga­pore web­site states that Sin­ga­pore has ob­served up­ward trends in rain­fall an­nu­ally, but it is not sci­en­tif­i­cally pos­si­ble, us­ing avail­able re­search in­for­ma­tion, to pin these trends on global warm­ing, nat­u­ral cli­mate vari­abil­ity or other causes such as ur­ban­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Said Prof Koh: “Cli­mate change is a re­al­ity but one should be mind­ful that not ev­ery record-set­ting weather should be linked to man­made cli­mate change. Other­wise, it would ap­pear un­sci­en­tific and may en­cour­age sim­i­larly un­sci­en­tific re­ac­tions from cli­mate-change de­niers.”</p>
