    <p>In Au­gust, Ms Nur­hazi­rah Mo­hamed Ade­nan hired event plan­ner Zep­pelin Events to throw a sur­prise party for her fi­ance’s 25th birth­day at Dusk Res­tau­rant & Bar in Mount Faber.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old nurse paid $380 for a party pack­age that in­cluded a food plat­ter, elec­tronic can­dles, flow­ers, ro­man­tic styling for the din­ner ta­ble – com­plete with a cus­tomised back­drop of fairy lights set against the pic­turesque view from Faber Peak.</p>
    <p>It was just the cou­ple cel­e­brat­ing on their own this year due to safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, but Ms Nur­hazi­rah, who saved for the oc­ca­sion, did not feel the need to scale back.</p>
    <p>“Birthdays are al­ways spe­cial to us, but it feels even more mean­ing­ful to cel­e­brate a loved one’s birth­day dur­ing the pan­demic,” she says.</p>
    <p>De­spite so­cial gath­er­ings be­ing lim­ited to five and a gen­eral down­ward trend in busi­ness, party plan­ners tell The Sun­day Times that peo­ple are still splash­ing out on cel­e­bra­tions.</p>
    <p>They are also spend­ing more on more elab­o­rate party set-ups such as styled dessert ta­bles and fancy back­drops, and less on food.</p>
    <p>Pre-Covid-19, they say, most clients who re­quested party dec­o­ra­tions and back­drops had 50 guests or more.</p>
    <p>Co-owner of Zep­pelin Events Zach Chua, 26, was sur­prised when he re­ceived in­quiries dur­ing phase two for set-ups for par­ties with fewer than five guests.</p>
    <p>He notes that clients are also al­lo­cat­ing more of their bud­get to noned­i­bles such as dec­o­ra­tions, bal­loons and flow­ers, and less on food since there are fewer guests to feed.</p>
    <p>“Now, the fo­cus is on cre­at­ing the per­fect party back­drop for photo op­por­tu­ni­ties, so peo­ple can post pic­tures on so­cial me­dia.”</p>
    <p>Ms Chloe Xie, 33, and Ms Li Hui, 37, who own Party Mas­ter En­ter­tain­ment, which pro­vides party back­drops and cus­tomised cakes, have also ob­served this trend.</p>
    <p>In­stead of multi-tiered cakes weigh­ing be­tween 3kg and 4kg, they now go for 1kg sin­gle-tier cakes which are priced from $120.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic, their clients forked out an av­er­age of $3,000 for a party of be­tween 30 and 150 guests. Now, that fig­ure is $700 for party dec­o­ra­tions and cake – even for par­ties with­out guests.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness picked up last month, es­pe­cially for birth­day par­ties.</p>
    <p>Ms Xie says: “Throw­ing a party dur­ing the pan­demic makes peo­ple happy. For par­ents es­pe­cially, cel­e­brat­ing their chil­dren’s birthdays and see­ing their happy faces are price­less.”</p>
    <p>Ms Ru­bina Tiyu, 37, owner of Dreams & Doo­dle, says that preCovid-19, her clients typ­i­cally paid $1,500 to $2,000 for 50 to 100 guests. In phase two, they are spend­ing $300 to $1,200 on set-ups for par­ties of no more than five.</p>
    <p>She says: “The mind­set is, how can we bring some joy to our lives in the midst of this pan­demic? Any happy oc­ca­sion is worth cel­e­brat­ing.”</p>
    <p>She notes that par­ties, such as the first-month or 100-day cel­e­bra­tions for ba­bies, may be­come more im­por­tant for par­ents as their friends and ex­tended fam­ily mem­bers may not even have seen the baby.</p>
    <p>Mr Adrian Goh, 38, who runs an on­line sake shop, and his Tai­wanese wife, Ms Kiki Chen, 32, had orig­i­nally planned a party for 100 guests at HortPark for their daugh­ter’s first birth­day on Sept 19, which was later scup­pered with the so­cial gath­er­ing lim­its.</p>
    <p>Ms Chen’s par­ents i n Tai­wan have never seen their grand­daugh­ter in per­son. The cou­ple had can­celled their trip to Tai­wan in March due to the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>For their daugh­ter’s birth­day last month, they spent close to $100 on party dec­o­ra­tions and props, which they bought on­line, and another $300 on two cus­tomised cakes and 40 frosted cup­cakes for the dessert ta­ble which they styled them­selves.</p>
    <p>Although t hey did not have enough guests to fin­ish the cakes,</p>
    <p>Ms Chen wanted them as party props.</p>
    <p>Their guests did not stay long, pop­ping by mainly to see the baby and for pho­tos.</p>
    <p>“Putting to­gether the party back­drop for my daugh­ter means a lot to me, as we want to show her the pho­tos when she is older,” Ms Chen, a ship­ping of­fi­cer, says.</p>
    <p>“We want her to know that even dur­ing a pan­demic, her par­ents still made the ef­fort to make her first birth­day a spe­cial one.”</p>
    <p>Another par­ent who went the ex­tra mile is Ms Joanne Sim, who threw a vir­tual mer­maid-themed party for her daugh­ter’s sixth birth­day in June.</p>
    <p>The 43-year-old di­rec­tor of a re­tail and dis­tri­bu­tion com­pany in­vited eight of her daugh­ter’s friends to at­tend the party via Zoom and en­gaged en­ter­tain­ment com­pany Ever Af­ter for about $200.</p>
    <p>An en­ter­tainer dressed as a mer­maid princess de­lighted the chil­dren with story-telling, singing and a scav­enger hunt.</p>
    <p>Ms Sim says: “My daugh­ter goes to Pri­mary 1 next year. She has missed out on fam­ily va­ca­tions and her kinder­garten grad­u­a­tion con­cert this year, so I wanted to do some­thing spe­cial for her.”</p>
    <p>Ms Brie Ben­fell, 32, who set up Ever Af­ter in 2017, came up with vir­tual party pack­ages dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker. Be­tween April and June, she had about 20 clients a month. She raised her prices in June from $250 to $300 for a one-hour ses­sion.</p>
    <p>But in the two months be­fore, the new mother, who gave birth in June, says she did sev­eral short Zoom calls for chil­dren whose par­ents could not af­ford her charges.</p>
    <p>“I wanted to bring some smiles to fam­i­lies dur­ing this stress­ful time.”</p>
    <p>Ms Ali­cia Lye, 30, owner of Hap­pier Sin­ga­pore, which spe­cialises in party dec­o­ra­tions and en­ter­tain­ment, says dec­o­ra­tions and props make those who see them happy – even if they did not at­tend the party.</p>
    <p>“On so­cial me­dia, pho­tos of par­ties may mo­ti­vate even strangers to wish you well and gen­er­ate con­ver­sa­tions. Even if you can’t have many guests at your party, post­ing pho­tos of it on­line is one way of shar­ing your hap­pi­ness with friends.”</p>
    <p>One up­side to small-scale birth­day par­ties, she adds, is that par­ents can spend more time with their chil­dren in­stead of en­ter­tain­ing guests.</p>
    <p>Mother of five An­ge­line Yang, 30, cel­e­brated her and two of her sons’ birthdays last month by en­gag­ing Dreams & Doo­dle to put to­gether a camp­ing-themed party. Her chil­dren are aged two to eight.</p>
    <p>Due to the pan­demic, she de­cided not to have any guests. She paid about $1,000 for the set-up, which in­cluded fairy lights on the ceil­ing, five child-size teepees and props.</p>
    <p>Ms Yang, a zumba trainer, says: “It has been hard for my boys to not</p>
    <p>be able to go out and meet their friends and be con­stantly nagged at to wash their hands.”</p>
    <p>“For the first time dur­ing the pan­demic, my sons did not fight. Ev­ery­one was in a good mood and we had a nice time camp­ing in the liv­ing room,” she says.</p>
    <p>“Even af­ter the teepees were re­moved, the kids con­tin­ued to ‘camp’ in the liv­ing room for two more days. They also talked about the party for the rest of the week.”</p>
    <p>Ms Xie of Party Mas­ter En­ter­tain­ment says: “To some peo­ple, cel­e­brat­ing a birth­day with elab­o­rate party dec­o­ra­tions may seem os­ten­ta­tious and a waste of money. But another way of look­ing at it is that it is im­por­tant to live in the present, cher­ish your loved ones and en­joy a ‘pan­demic-free zone’, even if it is only for a few hours.”</p>
    <p>That was Ms Nur­hazi­rah’s mind­set when she threw the party for her fi­ance, Mr Mo­hamed Faris Mo­hamed Daud, a civil ser­vant.</p>
    <p>Since get­ting en­gaged in Fe­bru­ary, they have not spent much time to­gether be­cause of hec­tic work sched­ules.</p>
    <p>Ms Nur­hazi­rah says: “Cel­e­brat­ing happy oc­ca­sions in an ex­tra spe­cial way is not about show­ing off, but an ex­pres­sion of how much we cher­ish our loved ones and cre­at­ing happy mem­o­ries even dur­ing stress­ful times.”</p>
