    <p>I al­ways tell the boys that if a mis­take hap­pens in the game, move on from it im­me­di­ately be­cause there’s still the rest of the game to play.</p>
    <p>NAZRI NASIR, Young Lions coach, on his team’s char­ac­ter in com­ing back af­ter con­ced­ing the equaliser.</p>
    <p>Ex­actly a year from the 2021 SEA Games, the Young Lions de­liv­ered a rare Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL) win with grit and men­tal tough­ness that cap­tain Ja­cob Mahler hoped will be a spring­board to bet­ter things.</p>
    <p>A late goal by Ry­han Ste­wart gave them a 2-1 vic­tory yes­ter­day over Balestier Khalsa, who had de­fender Fadli Kamis sent off.</p>
    <p>It was the Young Lions’ se­cond win in 10 games this term, and the re­sult at the Bis­han Sta­dium also lifted them off the foot of the ta­ble.</p>
    <p>Their other vic­tory was last month against Tan­jong Pa­gar United, who slipped to last.</p>
    <p>Mahler’s penalty just be­fore half­time had put the Un­der-22 out­fit ahead. But R. Aar­avin equalised in the 56th minute.</p>
    <p>Fadli, who in­ex­pli­ca­bly han­dled the ball to con­cede the spot kick, had an evening to for­get. He was dis­missed for an el­bow on Hami Syahin just af­ter the hour.</p>
    <p>The Young Lions’ 16-year-old striker Khairin Nadim later took ad­van­tage of a stretched Balestier back­line to cre­ate Ste­wart’s win­ner with four min­utes to go.</p>
    <p>Mahler said the squad are look­ing for­ward to the Viet­nam Games, sched­uled for Nov 21-Dec 2 next year, and also putting last year’s dis­as­trous cam­paign be­hind them.</p>
    <p>In the Philip­pines Games, Sin­ga­pore’s U-22s failed to make the semi-fi­nals af­ter fin­ish­ing fourth in their six-team group.</p>
    <p>Those poor re­sults were com­pounded by cases of ill-discipline. Nine of the 20-strong squad were fined be­tween $1,000 and $2,000 by the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Olympic Coun­cil for break­ing cur­few in two sep­a­rate in­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>“The last SEA Games was my first one, and we didn’t have the best per­for­mance and things hap­pened on and off the field, which we as play­ers have to take re­spon­si­bil­ity for,” said Mahler, 20.</p>
    <p>“So we’re look­ing for­ward to next year. We know we’re nowhere near the fin­ished prod­uct to be able to com­pete against Thai­land or (the re­gion’s other top teams) yet, but hope­fully we can con­tinue to develop and im­prove and do some­thing dif­fer­ent.”</p>
    <p>Young Lions coach Nazri Nasir, who could take the reins of the SEA Games team – a head coach has not been an­nounced yet – hailed his charges’ char­ac­ter, par­tic­u­larly af­ter Balestier equalised.</p>
    <p>“I al­ways tell the boys that if a mis­take hap­pens in the game, move on from it im­me­di­ately be­cause there’s still the rest of the game to play,” said the for­mer Lions skip­per.</p>
    <p>“And this is ex­actly what they did tonight. The boys showed they learnt from (con­ced­ing in the se­cond half in) pre­vi­ous games against Tampines Rovers and Hougang United.”</p>
    <p>He also praised the “con­fi­dence and hunger” they showed from the first whis­tle as they ha­rangued and has­sled their op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>The loss pro­longed Balestier’s win­less run to four games, with coach Marko Kral­je­vic say­ing: “We were se­cond best for ev­ery­thing. We were think­ing slow, closed down their play­ers slow, lost pos­ses­sion very eas­ily, and never got into the flow of the game.</p>
    <p>“Why? I’m not sure, but I don’t want to speak too much right af­ter the game. We’ll look back at this on Mon­day in train­ing.”</p>
    <p>In an­other match yes­ter­day, Gey­lang In­ter­na­tional moved up to fourth af­ter a 2-0 win over Hougang United, thanks to goals from Barry Maguire and Amy Recha.</p>
