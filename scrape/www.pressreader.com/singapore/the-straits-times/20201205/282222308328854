    <p>In an opin­ion piece pub­lished on the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) web­site, then Se­nior Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary Tan Wu Meng ques­tioned Work­ers’ Party (WP) chief Pri­tam Singh’s sup­port for Mr Alfian Sa’at, cit­ing the lat­ter’s crit­i­cal com­ments about Sin­ga­pore, and writ­ing that Sin­ga­pore had given the lat­ter “an ed­u­ca­tion and a liv­ing… de­nied to many mi­nori­ties in the re­gion”. Ob­servers crit­i­cised what they saw as a con­de­scend­ing por­trayal of Mr Alfian as an un­grate­ful mem­ber of the mi­nori­ties – and post-elec­tion, noted that the ar­ti­cle could have con­trib­uted to voter dis­sat­is­fac­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Raeesah Khan apol­o­gised for her old Face­book posts, say­ing she had no in­ten­tion of caus­ing so­cial divi­sion and wanted only to raise aware­ness of mi­nor­ity is­sues.</p>
    <p>Old Face­book posts by WP can­di­date for Sengkang GRC Raeesah Khan were brought to light – and made the sub­ject of po­lice re­ports – in the lead-up to this year’s Gen­eral Elec­tion. In one, she wrote about for­eign­ers flout­ing safe dis­tanc­ing rules, ask­ing if the law dif­fered for “rich Chi­nese or white peo­ple”.</p>
    <p>Ms Raeesah apol­o­gised, say­ing she had no in­ten­tion of caus­ing so­cial divi­sion and wanted only to raise aware­ness of mi­nor­ity is­sues. The PAP called her com­ments “highly deroga­tory” and ques­tioned if she was fit to be an MP.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts have fre­quently cited these events as a pos­si­ble fac­tor in the WP win­ning Sengkang GRC. Po­lice later is­sued her a stern warn­ing for pro­mot­ing en­mity be­tween groups.</p>
