    <p>GENEVA • The In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion (Iata) is work­ing on a mo­bile app that will help trav­ellers demon­strate their coro­n­avirus-free sta­tus, join­ing a push to in­tro­duce so-called “Covid-19 pass­ports” to speed up the re­vival of in­ter­na­tional travel.</p>
    <p>The Travel Pass will dis­play test re­sults to­gether with proof of in­oc­u­la­tion, as well as list na­tional en­try rules and details on the near­est labs, ac­cord­ing to Iata.</p>
    <p>The app will also link to an elec­tronic copy of the holder’s pass­port to prove his iden­tity.</p>
    <p>A test pro­gramme will be­gin with Bri­tish Air­ways par­ent IAG this year be­fore ar­riv­ing on Ap­ple de­vices in the first quar­ter of next year and on An­droid from April, Iata said. Trav­ellers will be able to share their sta­tus with border au­thor­i­ties or present a QR code for scan­ning.</p>
    <p>Mr Pi­eter El­bers, head of the Dutch arm of Air France-KLM, said “we need to have global rules and stan­dards” on mea­sures like rapid test­ing and vac­ci­na­tion so there can be a “step for­ward” for the in­dus­try. The health ad­vances “will def­i­nitely help to re­store con­fi­dence in travel”, he added.</p>
    <p>Qan­tas Air­ways said a Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion will be a ne­ces­sity for its in­ter­na­tional pas­sen­gers when vac­cines are ap­proved and dis­trib­uted. Its chief ex­ec­u­tive Alan Joyce told Chan­nel 9 in Aus­tralia that he has dis­cussed the idea with other air­lines, and it is likely to be­come a pre-board­ing re­quire­ment around the world. “It’s go­ing to be a com­mon theme across the board,” said Mr Joyce.</p>
    <p>While in­ter­na­tional travel re­mains in the dol­drums amid a patch­work of lo­cal re­stric­tions and lock­downs, coun­tries are be­gin­ning to em­brace test­ing to shorten or do away with quar­an­tines for ar­riv­ing pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>The first vac­cines are, mean­while, ex­pected to be­come avail­able in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>That has prompted a spate of tech­nol­ogy-led moves to de­vise mech­a­nisms to mon­i­tor trav­ellers’ Covid-19 cre­den­tials and com­bat false claims from peo­ple des­per­ate to fly.</p>
    <p>In Britain, the in­dus­try also got a boost from the gov­ern­ment’s de­ci­sion to cut the 14-day quar­an­tine for ar­rivals to Eng­land from high­risk coun­tries by al­most two-thirds if they take a coro­n­avirus test. The eas­ing of the re­stric­tions start­ing on Dec 15 will come just in time for the Christ­mas hol­i­day rush.</p>
    <p>Travel Pass will be free to trav­ellers and gov­ern­ments, with air­lines pay­ing a small fee per pas­sen­ger to use the ser­vice.</p>
    <p>It will be based on the ex­ist­ing Iata Ti­matic sys­tem long used to ver­ify doc­u­ments. The app will use blockchain tech­nol­ogy and will not store data, said Iata head of pas­sen­ger and se­cu­rity prod­ucts Alan Mur­ray Hay­den.</p>
    <p>The in­dus­try group has had pos­i­tive dis­cus­sions with one gov­ern­ment around us­ing the soft­ware and ex­pects other na­tions to get on board, he said.</p>
    <p>Though Iata’s plan re­mains in de­vel­op­ment, the Com­mon­Pass app de­vel­oped by the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum and non-profit Com­mons Project Foun­da­tion has been tested on flights be­tween Lon­don and New York, while the AOK­pass from travel se­cu­rity firm In­ter­na­tional SOS is in use be­tween Abu Dhabi and Pak­istan.</p>
    <p>Both are in the run­ning for the pend­ing travel bubble be­tween Hong Kong and Sin­ga­pore, ac­cord­ing to the com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>United Air­lines, which is con­duct­ing the US-Britain tri­als, said on Mon­day it would ex­tend Covid-19 test­ing to flights from Hous­ton to des­ti­na­tions in Latin Amer­ica and the Caribbean.</p>
    <p>Pas­sen­gers can take a self-col­lected, mail-in test, al­low­ing them to start their va­ca­tion or meet­ings im­me­di­ately on ar­rival.</p>
    <p>The race is on to es­tab­lish a global stan­dard and de­ploy tech­nol­ogy so the travel in­dus­try can get back on its feet, said In­ter­na­tional SOS co-founder Ar­naud Vaissie. “There is mas­sive pent-up de­mand,” he added.</p>
    <p>There is also “tremen­dous fear about trav­el­ling and this is what we are try­ing to mit­i­gate”.</p>
