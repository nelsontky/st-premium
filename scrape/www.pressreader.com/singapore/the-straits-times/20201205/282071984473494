    <p>China is en­joy­ing the United</p>
    <p>States’ pre­cip­i­tous with­drawal from Afghanista­n. From Beijing’s per­spec­tive, Amer­ica’s abrupt dash for the exit as the con­flict con­tin­ues to rage re­in­forces the ar­gu­ment that the US is an er­ratic and un­re­li­able player on the world stage.</p>
    <p>This glee, how­ever, should be tem­pered by the fact that the trou­ble that is likely to fol­low Amer­ica’s with­drawal is go­ing to cause Beijing more trou­ble than the seem­ingly never-end­ing con­flict which it has been able to ob­serve from the side­lines.</p>
    <p>In the short term, China has com­fort­ably hedged it­self against all direct threats from</p>
    <p>Afghanista­n.</p>
    <p>In the wake of dec­la­ra­tions un­der the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion that the US was go­ing to with­draw from Afghanista­n, China started a pro­gramme of in­vest­ment into the mil­i­tary and bor­der ca­pa­bil­i­ties of Afghanista­n, Pak­istan and Ta­jik­istan, coun­tries with which it shares the Wahkan Cor­ri­dor, China’s direct bor­der with Afghanista­n.</p>
    <p>It es­tab­lished a for­ward base for the Peo­ple’s Armed Po­lice in Ta­jik­istan, as well as built a base for Afghan forces in Badakhshan, where in the first few years Chi­nese forces would also pa­trol. The Chi­nese also in­au­gu­rated a new re­gional mul­ti­lat­eral struc­ture, the Quadri­lat­eral Co­op­er­a­tion and Co­or­di­na­tion Mech­a­nism, that brought to­gether the chiefs of army staff of the coun­tries with which it shared the Wakhan Cor­ri­dor.</p>
    <p>China also started to more openly cul­ti­vate its re­la­tions with all of the fac­tions on the Afghan bat­tle­field. Pre­vi­ously Beijing would rely on its “iron brother” Pak­istan to fa­cil­i­tate con­tacts with the Tale­ban. This in­cluded vis­its to Kabul pre-2001 to meet Tale­ban leader Mul­lah Omar and of­fers by com­pa­nies like Huawei to help build in­fra­struc­ture in the coun­try. But while this out­reach was ini­tially done be­hind the scenes, from 2014 on­wards China started to openly host Tale­ban del­e­ga­tions in Urumqi and Beijing, while its spe­cial en­voy for Afghanista­n Sun Yuxi would help or­gan­ise meet­ings in­volv­ing Pak­istan, Afghanista­n, the US and China.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, ev­ery se­nior visit by a Chi­nese of­fi­cial to Afghanista­n was ac­com­pa­nied by photo calls with all of the ma­jor po­lit­i­cal lead­ers in the city. The re­sult of all this en­gage­ment was state­ments by the Tale­ban that they would help pro­tect Chi­nese in­fra­struc­ture in­vest­ments in the coun­try, as well as reg­u­lar sup­port for Chi­nese per­spec­tives by all fac­tions in the Afghan gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther side – Tale­ban or the Afghan gov­ern­ment – said they would pro­vide sup­port for Uighur mil­i­tant groups us­ing Afghanista­n as a base to launch at­tacks in</p>
    <p>China. In fact, both said they would ac­tively eject such groups from their ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>All of this has given Beijing the sense of hav­ing ef­fec­tively shielded it­self from the Afghan con­flict. It has hard­ened its direct and in­di­rect bor­ders and has won friends across the board. The­o­ret­i­cally, China is well-placed no mat­ter what hap­pens in a post-Amer­ica Afghanista­n.</p>
    <p>IN­DIA, U.S. AND THE UIGHURS</p>
    <p>Yet this happy sit­u­a­tion for China is now vul­ner­a­ble to the broader ten­sions it has en­gen­dered through its re­cent ag­gres­sive for­eign pol­icy. Afghanista­n used to shine for China as a place where it could co­op­er­ate with even its most dif­fi­cult part­ners. Dur­ing the Obama years, China and the US had de­vel­oped a se­ries of co­op­er­a­tive projects in Afghanista­n, in­clud­ing a diplo­mat train­ing pro­gramme which in­volved cour­ses in Beijing and Wash­ing­ton. When Pres­i­dent Xi</p>
    <p>Jin­ping and In­dia’s Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi met first in Wuhan in April 2018 and then later near Chennai in Oc­to­ber last year, they dis­cussed Afghanista­n as a place for co­op­er­a­tion, with in­fra­struc­ture as a pos­si­ble area of par­tic­u­lar fo­cus.</p>
    <p>But the sour­ing of ties with the US and In­dia has largely put paid to these ef­forts. The Sino-US joint pro­gramme was sus­pended ear­lier in the year pur­port­edly be­cause of Covid-19 re­stric­tions, but seems un­likely to start again. And any­way, any co­op­er­a­tive ac­tiv­ity be­tween the US and China in Afghanista­n is go­ing to be com­pli­cated by the fact that the US gov­ern­ment made a de­ci­sion in Oc­to­ber this year to re­move the East Turkestan Is­lamic Move­ment (ETIM) from its list of ter­ror­ist or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>An or­gan­i­sa­tion whose spe­cific ex­is­tence has long been dis­puted, ETIM is the catch-all term used by the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties to de­scribe Uighur mil­i­tants. For years the US had ac­ceded to the group’s in­clu­sion on its list of banned ter­ror­ist groups, in part to en­sure China’s sup­port for Wash­ing­ton’s broader war against ter­ror­ism. But what Uighur mil­i­tants do ex­ist tend to use a dif­fer­ent name, fight­ing in Afghanista­n and Syria un­der the ban­ner of the Turkestan Is­lamic Party. They talk about at­tack­ing China in their videos, and have his­tor­i­cally claimed links to in­ci­dents in China (though the ev­i­dence of ac­tual re­spon­si­bil­ity is lim­ited).</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton’s de­ci­sion to re­move ETIM from its list of pro­scribed groups hard­ens the rup­ture be­tween China and Wash­ing­ton in Afghanista­n. One of Beijing’s big­gest stated con­cerns about Afghanista­n is the pos­si­bil­ity of Uighur mil­i­tants op­er­at­ing as ETIM us­ing the coun­try as a stag­ing point from which to at­tack China.</p>
    <p>Yet now Wash­ing­ton does not even ac­knowl­edge that the or­gan­i­sa­tion ex­ists, mean­ing it for­mally dis­putes one of the fun­da­men­tal rea­sons for Chi­nese en­gage­ment in Afghanista­n. For the US to re­verse this de­ci­sion would re­quire the State Depart­ment to push through leg­is­la­tion tar­get­ing Uighur mil­i­tants at the same time as the en­tire US gov­ern­ment is at­tack­ing China’s broader pol­icy to­wards Uighurs through an es­ca­lat­ing sanc­tions regime.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s po­si­tion is less com­pli­cated, though it is un­likely that the gov­ern­ment in Delhi will be very in­ter­ested in en­gag­ing China over Afghanista­n given cur­rent broader ten­sions as a re­sult of the bor­der clashes ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>The Tale­ban’s con­tin­ued hos­til­ity to­wards In­dia as well as Pak­istan’s long shadow and close ties to China sug­gest it is un­likely that we will see co­op­er­a­tion be­tween Delhi and Beijing soon. In fact, there are in­di­ca­tions that we might even see the op­po­site.</p>
    <p>BALUCHIS­TAN SEP­A­RATISTS</p>
    <p>One of the ir­ri­tants that China has no­ticed over the past few years is the grow­ing in­stances of vi­o­lence by Baluchi sep­a­ratist groups in Pak­istan tar­get­ing Chi­nese projects in the coun­try. These groups loudly tout their anger against Islamabad and Beijing, ac­cus­ing them both of rap­ing their land in Pak­istan’s Baluchis­tan province while launch­ing at­tacks on prom­i­nent tar­gets linked to China such as a bus­load of Chi­nese en­gi­neers, or a ho­tel in Gwadar</p>
    <p>(the Pak­istani port that is spo­ken of as the “jewel” of the wider China Pak­istan Eco­nomic Cor­ri­dor). They do this from bases in Afghanista­n, par­tic­u­larly in Kan­da­har.</p>
    <p>Pak­istani, and in­creas­ingly Chi­nese, ex­perts blame much of this Baluchi vi­o­lence on In­di­ans and their Afghan prox­ies. From their per­spec­tive, Delhi is play­ing an old game of ma­nip­u­lat­ing mil­i­tants based in Afghanista­n against them. Place this ac­tiv­ity along­side the Amer­i­can de­ci­sion about ETIM, and it can look to Beijing like Afghanista­n is be­com­ing a place where two of its big­gest ad­ver­saries are lin­ing up to sup­port anti-Chi­nese mil­i­tant groups.</p>
    <p>What­ever the mer­its of the ac­cu­sa­tions, the fact re­mains that Afghanista­n’s ge­og­ra­phy and porous bor­ders make it an invit­ing base from which mil­i­tant fight­ers can strike at Pak­istan and Xin­jiang province.</p>
    <p>TALE­BAN PROM­ISES</p>
    <p>China may draw com­fort from Tale­ban state­ments about not sup­port­ing for­eign mil­i­tants in us­ing their ter­ri­tory, but the Tale­ban’s his­tory of re­li­a­bil­ity about such state­ments is quite thin.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese of­fi­cials and ex­perts alike love to chuckle about how Afghanista­n is the grave­yard of em­pires. They point to the fu­til­ity of pre­vi­ous Bri­tish, Rus­sian and now Amer­i­can ef­forts to as­sert their might over the coun­try. They would never be so silly as to get caught in that trap, they say.</p>
    <p>Yet sim­ply stand­ing back is not go­ing to make Afghanista­n’s prob­lems go away. China’s large min­eral ex­trac­tion projects in Afghanista­n (a cop­per mine in Mes Ay­nak and an oil­field in the north) have not brought the Afghans the ben­e­fits hoped for. Beijing can­not but be on the watchout for its ad­ver­saries latch­ing on to local dis­gruntle­ment against failed projects to stoke a big­ger back­lash.</p>
    <p>China may not want to get dragged into Afghanista­n’s trou­bles, but it may find it­self un­able to avoid them. Whether Amer­ica com­pletely with­draws or not, China will still be Afghanista­n’s wealth­i­est neigh­bour with grow­ing eco­nomic in­ter­ests in ev­ery coun­try that Afghanista­n bor­ders. Its con­cerns about do­mes­tic and re­gional threats from ter­ror­ism and in­sta­bil­ity have links into the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Beijing may now be en­joy­ing Amer­ica’s em­bar­rass­ing with­drawal, but it is the one that is most likely to feel the longer-term reper­cus­sions.</p>
