    <p>Huawei made its name in smart­phones, but lap­tops may be the Chi­nese tech gi­ant’s best shot at ex­pand­ing out­side its home­land.</p>
    <p>Un­like its Google-less smart­phones, Huawei’s note­books are not af­fected by the United States trade ban.</p>
    <p>On the con­trary, Huawei’s lap­tops are stuffed to the gills with Amer­i­can tech, in­clud­ing a 10th-gen­er­a­tion In­tel Core i7 pro­ces­sor, an en­trylevel Nvidia GeForce MX250 graph­ics chip and Mi­crosoft’s Win­dows 10 oper­at­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Its lat­est MateBook X Pro, which was launched last month in Sin­ga­pore, is a pre­mium model that will give high-end ul­tra­books such as Dell’s XPS and HP’s Spec­tre se­ries a run for their money.</p>
    <p>For one thing, the 13.9-inch MateBook X Pro is as sleek as its ri­vals. Its build qual­ity is im­pec­ca­ble with an all-metal chas­sis that is firm and un­yield­ing.</p>
    <p>The de­sign is un­changed from last year’s ver­sion. But this is prob­a­bly a moot point to lo­cal con­sumers as the 2019 edi­tion was not launched in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>At 1.3kg, the MateBook X Pro is rea­son­ably light, though there are more por­ta­ble lap­tops on the mar­ket. I feel that its heft helps to con­vey a sense of qual­ity.</p>
    <p>The MateBook X Pro is one of the few note­books with a 3:2 dis­play, which is op­ti­mal for pro­duc­tiv­ity as it of­fers more ver­ti­cal screen real es­tate to let you view more of a doc­u­ment or Web page.</p>
    <p>This touch­screen is also said to of­fer 100 per cent cov­er­age of the sRGB colour space. It cer­tainly looks lively and vi­brant. It is also brighter than usual, at up to 450 nits, though its Corn­ing Go­rilla Glass fin­ish is more re­flec­tive than a matt sur­face.</p>
    <p>While t he screen bezels are in­cred­i­bly slim, they come at a price. Be­cause the ra­zor-thin top bezel can­not ac­com­mo­date a Web cam­era, Huawei has re­lo­cated it be­tween the F6 and F7 keys.</p>
    <p>This pop-up cam­era is hid­den from view un­til you de­press it. While this de­sign en­sures pri­vacy when the cam­era is not in use, its place­ment means the cam­era is look­ing up at your nos­trils and chin.</p>
    <p>One of my favourite fea­tures of the lap­top is its huge touch­pad. It is clicky, with am­ple room for mul­ti­touch ges­tures. The key­board, though, is stiffer than ex­pected – more pres­sure is re­quired for a key press to be reg­is­tered.</p>
    <p>An­other use­ful fea­ture is the PC Man­ager util­ity, which is a con­ve­nient dash­board to mon­i­tor hard­ware is­sues and check for new driv­ers. There are also short cuts to use­ful tools like the cal­cu­la­tor, screen­shot util­ity and notepad.</p>
    <p>Those with a re­cent NFC-ca­pa­ble Honor or Huawei smart­phone that sup­ports the Huawei Share fea­ture can tap their phones on the MateBook X Pro’s palm rest to con­nect to the notebook.</p>
    <p>Once the two de­vices are linked, you can drag and drop files and copy text be­tween them. You can even con­trol the phone via the lap­top and make calls or view phone no­ti­fi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>The MateBook X Pro has a USB Type-A port, so you do not need a don­gle to con­nect a USB Type-A de­vice, such as an ex­ter­nal hard drive.</p>
    <p>There are also two USB Type-C ports, which can be used with the com­pact power adap­tor, to charge the notebook bat­tery.</p>
    <p>Sur­pris­ingly for a lap­top boast­ing the lat­est com­put­ing hard­ware, Huawei seems to have ne­glected the Wi-Fi adap­tor, which sup­ports the older Wi-Fi 5 stan­dard and not the lat­est Wi-Fi 6.</p>
    <p>But in gen­eral, I have no com­plaints about the MateBook X Pro’s per­for­mance. It is re­spon­sive and fast. In the PCMark 10 bench­mark, the lap­top scored 4,162 com­pared with 3,747 for Huawei’s mid-range Core i5-pow­ered MateBook 13.</p>
    <p>The MateBook X Pro also per­formed very well in the video-loop bat­tery test. With the screen set to max­i­mum bright­ness, the notebook lasted just six min­utes shy of the nine-hour mark, putting it among the top note­books for bat­tery stamina.</p>
