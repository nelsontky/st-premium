    <p>Thou­sands of peo­ple gath­ered in Bangkok yes­ter­day in the big­gest anti-gov­ern­ment demon­stra­tion since the coro­n­avirus pan­demic gripped the king­dom.</p>
    <p>The pro­test­ers, led by univer­sity stu­dents and joined by po­lit­i­cal ac­tivists from other parts of the coun­try, swarmed Sanam Luang, a field next to the Grand Palace which is nor­mally fenced off and re­served for royal or of­fi­cial events. They pledged to camp overnight and march to a yet undis­closed gov­ern­ment of­fice today. Over 30,000 peo­ple were es­ti­mated to have turned up yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The week­end rally is the lat­est in a se­ries of protests that have erupted all over Thai­land against the coali­tion gov­ern­ment led by Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha, which crit­ics ar­gue is propped up by a Con­sti­tu­tion spe­cially writ­ten to ce­ment the in­flu­ence of the roy­al­ist pro-mil­i­tary es­tab­lish­ment.</p>
    <p>Un­like pre­vi­ous flash-mob-style protests, ac­tivists planned an ex­tended sit-in this time round.</p>
    <p>Led by a stu­dent group called the United Front of Tham­masat and Demon­stra­tion (UFTD), the pro­test­ers are de­mand­ing re­form of Thai­land’s pow­er­ful and wealthy monar­chy. Dur­ing a rally on Aug 10, UFTD put for­ward 10 re­form pro­pos­als which in­cluded re­duc­ing the bud­get for royal ex­penses and not ex­ces­sively glo­ri­fy­ing the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>The pro­pos­als caused an up­roar among roy­al­ists, who re­gard the monar­chy as an un­touch­able in­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>While the gov­ern­ment has said it is open to con­sti­tu­tional change, it has called the de­mands for re­form of the monar­chy a “sen­si­tive” topic.</p>
    <p>A 3.3 tril­lion baht (S$144 bil­lion) bud­get for the com­ing fis­cal year passed by the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives at its fi­nal read­ing on Fri­day in­cluded al­most nine bil­lion baht for palace ex­penses.</p>
    <p>The protests are tak­ing place at a time when Mr Prayut is fac­ing tough eco­nomic chal­lenges. Thai­land’s econ­omy is pro­jected to shrink by 8.1 per cent at the year’s end and the Prime Min­is­ter is still strug­gling to fill the post of fi­nance min­is­ter af­ter for­mer banker Predee Daochai hastily va­cated the po­si­tion ear­lier this month. The deep re­ces­sion and loom­ing mass unem­ploy­ment has led to in­tense scru­tiny on how tax money is spent.</p>
    <p>Key UFTD mem­ber Parit Chi­warak told The Sun­day Times yes­ter­day: “When we men­tion our prob­lems, we never talk about the real cause of it... This should end in our gen­er­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>A 21-year-old un­der­grad­u­ate from Tham­masat Univer­sity – a tra­di­tional hot­bed of dis­sent – who was at the rally said the 10 pro­pos­als on the monar­chy were in­tended to strengthen the in­sti­tu­tion for the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Also present at yes­ter­day’s protest were many “red shirt” ac­tivists who played a key role in the past decade of colour-coded po­lit­i­cal con­flict in the king­dom – some­thing the cur­rent gen­er­a­tion of young pro­test­ers have lit­tle affin­ity with.</p>
    <p>“They joined us with the same ide­ol­ogy, to de­mand for democ­racy,” said Mr Parit.</p>
    <p>A 60-year-old red shirt sup­porter, who called her­self Aew, said: “The stu­dents came out to protest be­cause the red shirts failed to achieve our goals.”</p>
    <p>The pro­test­ers, wear­ing black Tshirts, face masks and rain­coats be­cause of an in­ter­mit­tent driz­zle, were largely peace­ful. One re­port said at least 10,000 uni­formed and plain­clothes po­lice of­fi­cers were pa­trolling the area around the rally.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has so far avoided di­rect con­fronta­tion with the demon­stra­tors. But Mr Prayut, in his strong­est com­ments yet, said on Thurs­day: “When you gather in mobs, you are cre­at­ing an enor­mous risk of new in­fec­tions. And with that, you also cre­ate enor­mous risk to the liveli­hoods of tens of mil­lions of fel­low Thais.”</p>
    <p>He said that while he had asked the po­lice to be tol­er­ant, the protests will de­lay busi­ness recovery by af­fect­ing busi­ness con­fi­dence and make tourists think twice about re­turn­ing to Thai­land.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>BANGKOK Wear­ing masks and hold­ing um­brel­las amid the light rain, thou­sands of Thai pro­test­ers gath­ered at a field next to the Grand Palace have the same mes­sage de­mand­ing re­forms to the pow­er­ful monar­chy, re­moval of the gov­ern­ment and fresh polls.</p>
    <p>The mass gath­er­ing re­flected the fast-growing movement led by univer­sity stu­dents.</p>
    <p>“Down with feu­dal­ism, long live the peo­ple,” was one of their chants yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The protests have been build­ing since mid-July.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­is­ers have bro­ken a long-stand­ing taboo by crit­i­cis­ing the monar­chy of King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn, who is pro­tected by strict lese ma­jeste law.</p>
    <p>The King sits at the apex of Thai power, but­tressed by the king­dom’s mil­i­tary and bil­lion­aire clans, and com­mands a for­tune es­ti­mated to be worth up to US$60 bil­lion (S$81.6 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>The pro-roy­al­ist coali­tion gov­ern­ment is l ed by Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha.</p>
    <p>“Our hope is to spread our mes­sage and com­mu­ni­cate to peo­ple why we need to re­form the monar­chy, why we need to get rid of the Prayut regime,” said Ms Panusaya Sithi­ji­rawat­tanakul, one of the lead­ers of the Tham­masat group.</p>
    <p>“We want the gov­ern­ment to re­alise that our movement isn’t in­signif­i­cant. Don’t think that we’re just stu­dents.”</p>
    <p>One demon­stra­tor, Mr Som­chai Weaingkum, said his fa­ther had ac­com­pa­nied him to the rally, and had brought him to protests in 2010 when he was 15 years old.</p>
    <p>“We want a full democ­racy, not just a pre­tend one,” Mr Som­chai said.</p>
    <p>The mount­ing protests present a chal­lenge for Mr Prayut, a for­mer army chief who stayed in charge af­ter a dis­puted elec­tion last year con­ducted un­der rules writ­ten by his mil­i­tary gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>His gov­ern­ment is cur­rently with­out a fi­nance min­is­ter af­ter the pre­vi­ous chief re­signed less than a month into the job, and it is fac­ing a two-week de­lay in its fis­cal year 2021 bud­get amid slow stim­u­lus spend­ing.</p>
    <p>The Thai econ­omy, heav­ily re­liant on trade and tourism, is on course for its deep­est ever an­nual con­trac­tion this year.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Su­pat­tanapong Pun­meechaow said that Thai­land may avoid its worst eco­nomic per­for­mance by boost­ing cash hand­outs to pan­demic-hit cit­i­zens and ac­cel­er­at­ing gov­ern­ment spend­ing in the fi­nal quar­ter.</p>
    <p>South-east Asia’s sec­ond-largest econ­omy may shrink less with the help of var­i­ous stim­u­lus mea­sures, and bar­ring a ma­jor sec­ond wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, Mr Su­pat­tanapong said, in an in­ter­view last Thurs­day with Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment ex­pects to­tal spend­ing of about 100 bil­lion baht (S$4.4 bil­lion) un­der its co-pay pro­grammes next quar­ter to re­vive do­mes­tic de­mand, he said.</p>
    <p>“The money from the stim­u­lus mea­sures that will come out in the fourth quar­ter should help sup­port the econ­omy and curb a sharp (gross do­mes­tic prod­uct) con­trac­tion,” Mr Su­pat­tanapong said.</p>
