    <p>With less than two weeks to go in the US elec­tion, and in a tight race in sev­eral key states, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump hit two bat­tle­grounds, Penn­syl­va­nia and North Carolina, for ral­lies on Tues­day and Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the FiveThirty-Eight web­site’s av­er­age of polls, Demo­cratic Party can­di­date Joe Bi­den, who leads Mr Trump na­tion­ally, has a slim 6.3-point lead over the Pres­i­dent in Penn­syl­va­nia. In North Carolina, Mr Bi­den leads by an even slim­mer 3.1 points, mak­ing it a toss-up.</p>
    <p>Penn­syl­va­nia has 20 Elec­toral Col­lege votes. In 2016, Mr Trump won the state by a mar­gin of just 44,292 votes out of over six mil­lion cast. The 0.72 per cent mar­gin was the nar­row­est in a pres­i­den­tial elec­tion for the state in 176 years, and ended a run of six straight Demo­cratic vic­to­ries there.</p>
    <p>It is Mr Bi­den’s home state, but he long ago moved to Delaware from where he won his Se­nate seat – a point Mr Trump fre­quently em­pha­sises when ral­ly­ing in Penn­syl­va­nia.</p>
    <p>North Carolina is a crit­i­cal bat­tle­ground: for­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama won it only nar­rowly in 2008; Mr Trump turned it in 2016, winning by only 3.66 per cent. The state has 15 Elec­toral Col­lege votes. But an­a­lysts say de­mo­graphic changes – in line with greater di­ver­sity in the United States as a whole – favour Mr Bi­den in the state.</p>
    <p>The Real Clear Pol­i­tics an­a­lyt­i­cal web­site’s pro­jec­tions still show Mr Bi­den ahead in the Elec­toral Col­lege – where 270 is the ma­jor­ity re­quired to win the White House – with a pro­jected 232, and Mr Trump pro­jected at 125.</p>
    <p>But as many as 181 Elec­toral Col­lege votes are still rated tossups. Separately the Cook Po­lit­i­cal Re­port rates six states in this cat­e­gory: Ari­zona (11 Elec­toral Col­lege votes); Florida (29); Michi­gan (16); North Carolina (15); Penn­syl­va­nia (20); and Wis­con­sin (10).</p>
