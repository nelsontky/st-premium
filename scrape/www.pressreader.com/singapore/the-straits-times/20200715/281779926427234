    <p>TOKYO • Health of­fi­cials in Tokyo ap­pealed yes­ter­day for over 800 the­atre­go­ers to get tested for Covid-19 af­ter a pro­duc­tion star­ring Ja­panese boy-band mem­bers was found to be the source of at least 20 cases.</p>
    <p>The Tokyo gov­ern­ment said it was fo­cus­ing on a 190-seat the­atre in Shin­juku, a busy en­ter­tain­ment area and home to one of Asia’s big­gest red-light dis­tricts, which has been the cen­tre of a re­cent spike in in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan is push­ing ahead with open­ing up parts of the coun­try, with plans to re­open a run­way at one of the coun­try’s big­gest air­ports, even as in­fec­tions per­sist in the cap­i­tal, as well as some ru­ral ar­eas and United States mil­i­tary bases.</p>
    <p>“It’s cru­cial that we main­tain cau­tion and pre­vent the fur­ther spread of in­fec­tions, while at the same time pur­su­ing eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity,” Chief Cabi­net Sec­re­tary Yoshi­hide Suga told a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The lat­est clus­ter has been traced to The­atre Moliere, which staged a play for six days star­ring mainly up-and-com­ing boy-band mem­bers ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>The Tokyo gov­ern­ment said it learnt of the first in­fec­tion of cast mem­ber on July 6, af­ter which test­ing found 20 re­lated cases by late Mon­day. It called on all au­di­ence mem­bers who at­tended the per­for­mance to get tested.</p>
    <p>The pro­duc­ers of the play Were­wolf re­leased a state­ment on Mon­day ask­ing the au­di­ence, who have been iden­ti­fied as “high-risk con­tacts”, to seek health ad­vice.</p>
    <p>Even as Tokyo strug­gles to con­tain virus in­fec­tions, travel routes to and from the city con­tinue to open up.</p>
    <p>Narita In­ter­na­tional Air­port, one of the two main air­ports serv­ing the cap­i­tal, is plan­ning to re­open its sec­ond run­way ahead of a pub­lic hol­i­day next week, pub­lic broad­caster NHK re­ported.</p>
    <p>Tokyo re­ported 143 new cases of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Over­all, Ja­pan has re­ported around 23,000 in­fec­tions and nearly 1,000 re­lated deaths.</p>
    <p>While Ja­pan has avoided more dis­as­trous out­breaks seen in other coun­tries, it faces a deep re­ces­sion in­stead of en­joy­ing a tourism boom that was ex­pected with the now­post­poned Olympics.</p>
    <p>A re­cent Tokyo sur­vey by the Asahi Shim­bun daily showed that 59 per cent be­lieve the Olympics should be post­poned again or can­celled, un­der­scor­ing the pub­lic’s wor­ries about the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The news­pa­per yes­ter­day re­ported that the Ja­panese gov­ern­ment was con­sid­er­ing eas­ing en­try re­stric­tions for ath­letes.</p>
