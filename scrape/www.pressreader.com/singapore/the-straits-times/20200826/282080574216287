    <p>Sin­ga­pore is fac­ing a short­age of man­power in tech­nol­ogy and that is the rea­son more for­eign­ers are needed in this area (Trade pacts haven’t jeop­ar­dised jobs for S’pore­ans: Heng, Aug 24).</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat’s state­ment about the short­age does not sur­prise me as sec­ondary school stu­dents in Sin­ga­pore do not learn com­puter sci­ence as a com­pul­sory sub­ject.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem is highly de­ter­min­is­tic and com­part­men­talised. A num­ber of In­te­grated Pro­gramme schools of­fer com­puter sci­ence as a com­pul­sory sub­ject from Sec­ondary 1 on­wards. But that is not the case for Ex­press/Nor­mal Aca­demic/ Nor­mal Tech­ni­cal stream stu­dents.</p>
    <p>At my son’s sec­ondary school, the O-level course on com­put­ing is capped at 20 stu­dents, and it is only open – as far as I am aware – to Ex­press stream stu­dents. Stu­dents must also first take and pass a com­puter ap­ti­tude test based – in part – on pro­gram­ming knowl­edge that was taught ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>I looked at a num­ber of schools in my home town in the United King­dom. All have com­put­ing as a com­pul­sory sub­ject from the start of sec­ondary school on­wards, re­gard­less of the sta­tus of the school or abil­ity of the child.</p>
    <p>At my son’s school, stu­dents must choose between triple sci­ence (that is, sep­a­rate O lev­els in bi­ol­ogy, chem­istry and physics) and com­puter sci­ence. I find this sur­pris­ing be­cause a course in com­puter sci­ence is surely just as rel­e­vant to stu­dents’ fu­ture em­ploy­ment prospects as tak­ing all three sci­ence O lev­els, es­pe­cially given that Sin­ga­pore is one of the most tech­no­log­i­cally ad­vanced coun­tries in the world.</p>
    <p>There are, of course, many tu­ition cen­tres that teach com­put­ing skills and cod­ing. But they are very ex­pen­sive. The al­ter­na­tive is for stu­dents to watch YouTube videos on the sub­ject and learn it them­selves.</p>
    <p>In my view, it is the job of the Gov­ern­ment to en­sure that Sin­ga­pore­ans have the nec­es­sary skills when they go out into the work­place. The fail­ure to teach com­put­ing skills to the en­tire sec­ondary school co­hort needs to be ad­dressed.</p>
