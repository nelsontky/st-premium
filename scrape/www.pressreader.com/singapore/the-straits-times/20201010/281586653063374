    <p>Multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions (MNCs) are stay­ing firm on their plans to ex­pand in Sin­ga­pore in spite of the eco­nomic down­turn trig­gered by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, and are hir­ing lo­cal tal­ent to sup­port these growth tar­gets.</p>
    <p>Global multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions (MNCs) are stay­ing firm on their plans to ex­pand in Sin­ga­pore in spite of the eco­nomic down­turn trig­gered by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, and are hir­ing lo­cal tal­ent to sup­port these growth tar­gets.</p>
    <p>They in­clude play­ers in the tech­nol­ogy sec­tor such as semi­con­duc­tor firm Glob­alFoundrie­s, life sci­ence tools man­u­fac­turer Il­lu­mina and Mi­cron Tech­nol­ogy, one of the world’s big­gest chip­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Chng Kai Fong said that the “ex­ist­ing pipe­line of com­mit­ted in­vest­ments that are sched­uled to be re­alised over the next three to five years re­main on track”.</p>
    <p>Mr Chng said: “We do not ex­pect Covid-19 to sig­nif­i­cantly af­fect these com­mit­ted projects be­cause the fac­tors which drove the de­ci­sions con­tinue to be valid.”</p>
    <p>The fac­tors in­clude Asia’s growth as a mar­ket, the deep skills of the lo­cal work­force, the eco-sys­tem of sup­pli­ers here and in the re­gion, and Sin­ga­pore’s con­nec­tiv­ity and open trad­ing pos­ture as well as its business-friendly and rules-based en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore’s strong fun­da­men­tals and rep­u­ta­tion for be­ing a trusted place to do business are more im­por­tant than ever amidst the dis­rup­tions caused by Covid-19,” he added.</p>
    <p>In the first half of this year, the Re­pub­lic drew about $14.3 bil­lion in fixed-as­set in­vest­ments – about 95 per cent of the to­tal in­vest­ment com­mit­ments for last year.</p>
    <p>Some MNCs in­ter­viewed by The Straits Times said that they are hir­ing for a range of po­si­tions, from en­gi­neers to cor­po­rate roles, to sup­port their ex­pan­sion plans.</p>
    <p>Glob­alFoundrie­s has more than 100 po­si­tions avail­able here, such as op­er­a­tors, tech­ni­cians and as­so­ciate en­gi­neers. It also has about 120 open­ings un­der the SGUnited Trainee­ship Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The Cal­i­for­nia-based semi­con­duc­tor man­u­fac­turer said the po­ten­tial hires may range from op­er­a­tors with N- or O-level qual­i­fi­ca­tions and tech­ni­cians with Nitec cer­ti­fi­ca­tion in en­gi­neer­ing, to as­so­ciate en­gi­neers with poly­tech­nic diplo­mas and en­gi­neers with de­grees.</p>
    <p>Ms Janice Lee, Glob­alFoundrie­s’ vice-pres­i­dent and hu­man re­sources lead for in­ter­na­tional fab oper­a­tions, said the com­pany is look­ing at “con­tin­u­ous re­cruit­ment” as it ramps up oper­a­tions to sup­port the height­ened de­mand for semi­con­duc­tors in the health­care, com­mu­ni­ca­tions, in­fras­truc­ture and se­cu­rity sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Life sci­ence tools man­u­fac­turer Il­lu­mina, head­quar­tered in Cal­i­for­nia, also has sev­eral po­si­tions open in re­search and de­vel­op­ment, cor­po­rate func­tions, soft­ware or bioin­for­mat­ics roles and oper­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Amer­i­can tech gi­ant Mi­cron Tech­nol­ogy has 200 full­time job open­ings, and an­other 150 trainee­ship roles which it aims to fill by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>Mi­cron’s di­rec­tor of tal­ent ac­qui­si­tion Zer­linda Tan said: “We are hir­ing across mul­ti­ple dis­ci­plines to in­vest in tal­ent for our teams and foster an en­vi­ron­ment for col­lab­o­ra­tion, cre­ativ­ity and in­no­va­tion.”</p>
    <p>Sev­eral other global firms have also an­nounced in­vest­ments in Sin­ga­pore this year, such as PayPal, Rakuten, Ka­jima, John­son Con­trols, Twit­ter and Zoom.</p>
    <p>Dr Lei Hsien-Hsien, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Amer­i­can Cham­ber of Com­merce in Sin­ga­pore, said about 83 per cent of firms it sur­veyed this year were re­tain­ing the same num­ber of work­ers, or even hir­ing more.</p>
    <p>“With a strong tal­ent pool qual­i­fied to carry out the work re­quired by re­gional and global head­quar­ters, Sin­ga­pore’s sta­tus as an in­ter­na­tional hub will grow stronger.”</p>
    <p>Land­ing a job in a multi­na­tional is of­ten seen as a daunt­ing, hotly com­pet­i­tive task, but some un­der­grad­u­ate work ex­pe­ri­ence and soft skills can go a long way.</p>
    <p>Chem­i­cal and biomolec­u­lar en­gi­neer­ing grad­u­ate Alvis Cheong did an in­tern­ship and par­tic­i­pated in case chal­lenges set by multi­na­tion­als, where he learnt how to cre­ate so­lu­tions to im­prove pro­duc­tion pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>This work ex­pe­ri­ence helped Mr Cheong, 26, to land his job at Amer­i­can semi­con­duc­tor man­u­fac­turer Glob­alFoundrie­s when he grad­u­ated from Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity in July last year.</p>
    <p>Now a process en­gi­neer, he ad­dresses is­sues that oc­cur on the pro­duc­tion line and de­vel­ops so­lu­tions that al­low Glob­alFoundrie­s’ three fab­ri­ca­tion plants to stream­line pro­cesses to in­crease pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>Look­ing back, he said: “One for­tu­nate thing as an un­der­grad­u­ate stu­dent in Sin­ga­pore is that we were given a lot of op­por­tu­ni­ties to ex­pose our­selves to learn and ex­pe­ri­ence what it is like in a work­ing en­vi­ron­ment.”</p>
    <p>He did his in­tern­ship at in­dus­trial gas sup­plier Air Liq­uide. “This ex­pe­ri­ence ex­posed me to im­ple­ment­ing a new gas line to ex­ist­ing pro­duc­tion plants, which helped in draw­ing the links be­tween the­o­ret­i­cal and prac­ti­cal ap­pli­ca­tions, where con­sid­er­a­tions of cost and safety have im­me­di­ate im­pli­ca­tions and have no room for er­ror.”</p>
    <p>He also took part in case chal­lenges to de­velop so­lu­tions for multi­na­tion­als to stream­line their pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>Be­sides ex­pe­ri­ence in work­ing with multi­na­tion­als and de­vel­op­ing tech­ni­cal ex­per­tise, soft skills are vi­tal, said Mi­cron Tech­nol­ogy shift man­u­fac­tur­ing pro­duc­tion en­gi­neer Farah Nad­hi­rah Ja’afar Ab­dul Razak.</p>
    <p>She leads a team man­ag­ing re­mote man­u­fac­tur­ing oper­a­tions, pro­vid­ing real-time analysis, cre­ative prob­lem solv­ing and timely de­ci­sion-mak­ing to sup­port the pro­duc­tion of the lat­est 3D Nand tech­nol­ogy mem­ory chips.</p>
    <p>Ms Farah, 24, joined Mi­cron in Fe­bru­ary last year af­ter grad­u­at­ing from the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy in Oc­to­ber the year be­fore with a ma­jor in aero­space sys­tems.</p>
    <p>While peo­ple might think that en­gi­neer­ing skills are im­por­tant, she said that other soft skills are paramount in land­ing a job with a multi­na­tional.</p>
    <p>“Strong com­mu­ni­ca­tions can con­trib­ute to a more col­lab­o­ra­tive work­place, im­prove time man­age­ment, ef­fi­ciency and work qual­ity,” she noted.</p>
    <p>This is along­side the need to con­tin­u­ally keep up­dated in an­a­lyt­i­cal skills and ad­vanced pro­gram­ming knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>Ms Farah added: “For job seek­ers look­ing for roles in multi­na­tion­als, my ad­vice is to fol­low your pas­sion but keep an open mind and iden­tify those industries with longevity.”</p>
    <p>These could be those that deal with cut­ting-edge tech­nol­ogy such as 5G, ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and smart man­u­fac­tur­ing, which are con­stantly evolv­ing and of­fer job op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
