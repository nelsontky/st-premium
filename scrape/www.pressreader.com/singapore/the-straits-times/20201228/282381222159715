    <p>• Chi­nese reg­u­la­tors have or­dered bil­lion­aire Jack Ma’s on­line fi­nan­cial ti­tan Ant Group to re­turn to its roots as a provider of pay­ments ser­vices, threat­en­ing to throt­tle growth in its most lu­cra­tive busi­nesses of con­sumer loans and wealth man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>The Peo­ple’s Bank of China sum­moned Ant ex­ec­u­tives at the week­end and told them to “rec­tify” the firm’s lend­ing, in­surance and wealth man­age­ment ser­vices, the cen­tral bank said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>While it stopped short of di­rectly ask­ing for a break-up of the firm, it stressed that Ant needed to “un­der­stand the ne­ces­sity of over­haul­ing its busi­ness” and come up with a timetable as soon as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Ant said in a state­ment yes­ter­day that it will set up a spe­cial team to cre­ate pro­pos­als and a timetable for an over­haul. It will main­tain busi­ness op­er­a­tions for users, vow­ing to keep costs for con­sumers and fi­nan­cial part­ners un­changed, while step­ping up risk con­trol.</p>
    <p>The edicts rep­re­sent a se­ri­ous threat to the ex­pan­sion of Mr Ma’s on­line fi­nance em­pire, which has grown rapidly from a PayPal-like op­er­a­tion into a full suite of ser­vices over the past 17 years. Be­fore reg­u­la­tors in­ter­vened, Ant was poised for a pub­lic list­ing that would have val­ued it at more than</p>
    <p>US$300 bil­lion (S$399 bil­lion). The firm now needs to move for­ward with set­ting up a sep­a­rate fi­nan­cial hold­ing com­pany to en­sure it has suf­fi­cient cap­i­tal, and pro­tect per­sonal pri­vate data, the cen­tral bank said.</p>
    <p>“This is the cul­mi­na­tion of a string of reg­u­la­tions and sets the di­rec­tion for Ant’s busi­ness going for­ward,” said Ms Zhang Xiaoxi, an an­a­lyst at Gavekal Drago­nomics. “We haven’t seen clear in­di­ca­tion of a break-up yet. Ant is a gi­ant player in the world and any breakup needs be to be cau­tious.”</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties also blasted Ant for sub-par cor­po­rate gov­er­nance, dis­dain to­wards reg­u­la­tory re­quire­ments, and en­gag­ing in reg­u­la­tory ar­bi­trage. The cen­tral bank said Ant used its dom­i­nance to ex­clude ri­vals, hurt­ing the in­ter­ests of its hun­dreds of mil­lions of con­sumers.</p>
    <p>China last week in­ten­si­fied its scru­tiny of the twin pil­lars of Mr Ma’s In­ter­net do­main when it also kicked off an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into al­leged mo­nop­o­lis­tic prac­tices at Ant af­fil­i­ate Alibaba Group Hold­ing. The e-com­merce firm’s US-listed shares tum­bled the most ever on news of the probe.</p>
    <p>The State Ad­min­is­tra­tion for Mar­ket Reg­u­la­tion dis­patched in­ves­ti­ga­tors to Alibaba last Thurs­day and the on-site in­ves­ti­ga­tion was com­pleted on the day, ac­cord­ing to a</p>
    <p>Satur­day re­port posted on a news app run by the Zhe­jiang Daily. The re­port cited an un­named of­fi­cial from the lo­cal mar­ket reg­u­la­tion watch­dog in Zhe­jiang prov­ince, where Alibaba is based.</p>
    <p>The pres­sure on Mr Ma is cen­tral to a broader ef­fort to curb an in­creas­ingly in­flu­en­tial In­ter­net sphere. Once hailed as driv­ers of eco­nomic pros­per­ity and sym­bols of China’s tech­no­log­i­cal prow­ess, the em­pires built by Mr Ma, Ten­cent Hold­ings chair­man Pony Ma Hu­ateng and other ty­coons are now un­der scru­tiny af­ter amass­ing hun­dreds of mil­lions of users and gain­ing in­flu­ence over al­most every as­pect of daily life in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Jack Ma’s own em­pire is in cri­sis mode. Early this month, with Ant un­der reg­u­la­tory scru­tiny, the man most closely iden­ti­fied with the me­te­oric rise of China Inc was ad­vised by the gov­ern­ment to stay in the coun­try, a per­son fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter has said.</p>
    <p>Alibaba has shed more than US$200 bil­lion of mar­ket value since last month, when reg­u­la­tors tor­pe­doed what would have been a record US$35 bil­lion Ant de­but.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, reg­u­la­tors are weigh­ing which busi­nesses Ant should give up con­trol of to con­tain the risks it poses to the econ­omy, of­fi­cials with knowl­edge of the mat­ter have said. They have not set­tled on whether to carve up its dif­fer­ent lines of op­er­a­tions, split its on­line and off­line ser­vices, or pur­sue a dif­fer­ent path al­to­gether.</p>
