    <p>WASHINGTON Ap­ple will pay US$113 mil­lion (S$152 mil­lion) to set­tle al­le­ga­tions by more than three dozen US reg­u­la­tors that the company mis­led con­sumers about iPhone bat­tery power and soft­ware up­dates that slowed the per­for­mance of the de­vices.</p>
    <p>The set­tle­ment was reached with 33 states and the District of Columbia, ac­cord­ing to state­ments on Wed­nes­day from sev­eral at­tor­neys-general.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tors al­leged that Ap­ple equipped iPhones with bat­ter­ies that tended to lose power and shut down, and then tried to man­age the is­sue through up­dates that “throt­tled” the de­vices’ per­for­mance in or­der to pre­vent them from turn­ing off.</p>
    <p>“Ap­ple with­held in­for­ma­tion about its bat­ter­ies that slowed down iPhone per­for­mance, all while pass­ing it off as an up­date,” said Cal­i­for­nia At­tor­ney-General Xavier Be­cerra, whose state will re­ceive US$24.6 mil­lion from the set­tle­ment.</p>
    <p>“This type of be­hav­iour hurts the pock­ets of con­sumers and lim­its their abil­ity to make in­formed pur­chases.</p>
    <p>“To­day’s set­tle­ment en­sures con­sumers will have ac­cess to the in­for­ma­tion they need to make a well-in­formed de­ci­sion when pur­chas­ing and us­ing Ap­ple prod­ucts.”</p>
    <p>In early 2018, Ap­ple con­firmed it had been in­ten­tion­ally throt­tling the speeds of some older phones to avoid bat­tery-re­lated prob­lems and of­fered cheap bat­tery up­grades to ex­tend the life of many hand­sets af­ter cus­tomers com­plained.</p>
    <p>The is­sue prompted in­quiries from fed­eral reg­u­la­tors and law­suits from state at­tor­neys-general and district at­tor­neys.</p>
    <p>Un­der terms of the agree­ment, Ap­ple will pro­vide in­for­ma­tion about how it man­ages power per­for­mance on a “prom­i­nent and ac­ces­si­ble” web­site, no­tify all af­fected con­sumers when an up­date will af­fect their phone and in­form users on the de­vice about whether they should up­date the bat­tery.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple cus­tomers have asked a Cal­i­for­nia fed­eral court to give fi­nal ap­proval to a class set­tle­ment, call­ing for the company to pay be­tween US$310 mil­lion and US$500 mil­lion to re­solve al­le­ga­tions that it hin­dered the bat­tery per­for­mance of older iPhones.</p>
