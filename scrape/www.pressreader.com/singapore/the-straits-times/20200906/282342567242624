    <p>If not for the Covid-19 pan­demic, cy­ber se­cu­rity con­sul­tant Ken­neth Lim, 30, would have taken a trip to Osaka and Ky­oto in Ja­pan with his fi­ancee this year.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the cou­ple spent a night last month ex­plor­ing buzzing Keong Saik, while stay­ing at the bou­tique Ho­tel Soloha, where they had cof­fee and pas­tries at bak­ery Bread and Hearth and Per­anakan fare at Blue Gin­ger.</p>
    <p>“You can­not re­place the va­ca­tion feel 100 per cent, but there is some ex­cite­ment be­cause I’ve never roamed around Keong Saik be­fore. On a hol­i­day, the thrill is in ex­plor­ing new places, which we still got to ex­pe­ri­ence,” says Mr Lim.</p>
    <p>With travel on hold, mil­len­ni­als like him are form­ing the bulk of stay­ca­tion guests at bou­tique ho­tels in cool neigh­bour­hoods on the city fringe.</p>
    <p>Mrs Eileen Lim, di­rec­tor of Ho­tel Yan in Jalan Be­sar, says about 70 per cent of guests since it re­opened for stay­ca­tions in July are in their 20s – a mix of cou­ples and groups of friends cel­e­brat­ing birth­days.</p>
    <p>At Ho­tel Soloha, founder Josh Hu says the bulk of guests have been cou­ples aged be­tween 27 and 36 since it re­opened in July.</p>
    <p>Many prop­er­ties are of­fer­ing dis­counts of be­tween 20 and 40 per cent to draw young work­ing pro­fes­sion­als han­ker­ing for now unattain­able hol­i­days abroad. Few mind that there is no pool, gym or free break­fast, when there is lots to do, see and eat in the neigh­bour­hood, some­times with tie-up dis­counts too.</p>
    <p>Prop­er­ties such as lyf Fu­nan, lo­cated in Fu­nan mall, of­fer up to 25 per cent dis­counts at pop­u­lar eater­ies nearby, such as Tiong Bahru Bak­ery and Crys­tal Jade Go. The ho­tel has also paired up with tour com­pa­nies Mon­ster Day Tours and Tribe</p>
    <p>Tours to take guests around the sur­round­ing neigh­bour­hoods.</p>
    <p>Its gen­eral man­ager Nor­man Cross says: “Guests will have the op­por­tu­nity to find out more about Sin­ga­pore’s her­itage and dis­cover places off the beaten track.”</p>
    <p>The Sun­day Times rounds up four ho­tels for an af­ford­able stay­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>• All four writ­ers’ one-night stay­ca­tions were hosted by their re­spec­tive ho­tels.</p>
