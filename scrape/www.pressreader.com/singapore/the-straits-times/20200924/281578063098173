    <p>Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son has im­posed fresh re­stric­tions in a bid to bring un­der con­trol a new wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions. But these mea­sures stop short of a to­tal national lock­down, and though his ob­jec­tive is to save lives and liveli­hoods, crit­ics say he risks miss­ing both aims.</p>
    <p>Warn­ing of “dif­fi­cult months to come”, Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son im­posed fresh re­stric­tions on the move­ment of peo­ple and eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties in the coun­try, in a bid to bring un­der con­trol a new wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son also warned of “even tougher mea­sures” in the weeks to come if peo­ple do not fol­low the new re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Con­fronted with statis­tics in­di­cat­ing that climb­ing in­fec­tion fig­ures are now be­gin­ning to trans­late into an omi­nous rise in the num­ber of deaths, Mr John­son used a rare speech to the na­tion to re­verse his government’s pre­vi­ous pol­icy of en­cour­ag­ing peo­ple to go back to their work­places, and is now ad­vis­ing them to work from home in­stead.</p>
    <p>But this move, as well as a raft of other re­stric­tive mea­sures which come into ef­fect to­day, stop short of the to­tal national lock­down which the Bri­tish government im­posed in March, when the in­fec­tions first reached a peak.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son is still keen to avoid in­flict­ing fur­ther pain on the Bri­tish econ­omy.</p>
    <p>His ob­jec­tive is to save lives, as well as peo­ple’s liveli­hoods, a bal­anc­ing act which his crit­ics warn still risks miss­ing both ob­jec­tives.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain is fac­ing a trend en­coun­tered in most Euro­pean coun­tries – a steep rise in in­fec­tions, largely driven by younger peo­ple who see the virus as no threat to them, and there­fore ig­nore ba­sic hy­giene or so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>New Covid-19 in­fec­tions in Bri­tain are grow­ing at about the same pace as they were at the be­gin­ning of April, and now run at more than 4,000 de­tected new cases each day.</p>
    <p>For the mo­ment, the num­ber of reg­is­tered daily deaths is still within the lower teens.</p>
    <p>But, as Mr John­son told his peo­ple, “if you let the virus rip through the rest of the pop­u­la­tion, it would in­evitably find its way through to the el­derly as well, and in much greater num­bers”.</p>
    <p>“The tragic re­al­ity of hav­ing Covid-19 is that your mild cough can be some­one else’s death knell,” added Mr John­son, whose own life was once en­dan­gered by the virus in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Apart from the ad­vice to work from home, the mea­sures start­ing to­day en­tail an ex­ten­sion of the manda­tory use of face masks, a cap of 15 peo­ple al­lowed to at­tend wed­ding cer­e­monies and other pub­lic events, as well as in­struc­tions to all pubs, bars and restau­rants to close by 10pm.</p>
    <p>The move to cur­tail res­tau­rant and bar hours, as well as the new re­quire­ment on the hos­pi­tal­ity sec­tor that cus­tomers should be served only while seated at ta­bles, are in­tended to pre­vent the crowd­ing which gen­er­ally takes place in late evening at var­i­ous drink­ing and eat­ing out­lets, a dan­ger­ous source of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish government is also tight­en­ing penal­ties for those flout­ing rules.</p>
    <p>Fines for breaches of health regu</p>
    <p>la­tions can now run up to £10,000 (S$17,400).</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish army has been or­dered to stand by for de­ploy­ment, to al­low the police to be di­verted to en­force anti-pan­demic mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son also hinted at the pos­si­bil­ity of a com­plete national lock­down in the next few weeks, should this be­come nec­es­sary, a plan which Bri­tish min­is­ters re­fer to – copy­ing a term first used in Sin­ga­pore – as a po­ten­tial “cir­cuit breaker”.</p>
    <p>Schools and uni­ver­si­ties may close too, if re­quired.</p>
    <p>An out­break of in­fec­tions at the Univer­sity of Liver­pool in north­west Eng­land is par­tic­u­larly wor­ry­ing for the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son en­joys cross-party par­lia­men­tary sup­port for his mea­sures, as well as the co­op­er­a­tion of the au­ton­o­mous gov­ern­ments in Scot­land and Wales, which have great lat­i­tude over their own health poli­cies.</p>
    <p>But he is fac­ing crit­i­cism from the op­po­si­tion Labour Party for his government’s fail­ure to in­tro­duce ad­e­quate trac­ing mech­a­nisms, and for his of­fi­cials’ botched at­tempts to ex­pand mass test­ing.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond coro­n­avirus lock­down, claims Labour leader Keir Starmer, “would be a government fail­ure – not an act of God”.</p>
    <p>Much will de­pend on de­vel­op­ments over the next few weeks.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son told the Bri­tish pub­lic: “We will spare no ef­fort in de­vel­op­ing vac­cines, treat­ments and new forms of mass test­ing, but un­less we pal­pa­bly make progress, we should as­sume that the re­stric­tions I have an­nounced will re­main in place for per­haps six months.”</p>
    <p>And, at least for the mo­ment, vot­ers ap­pear to be giv­ing him the ben­e­fit of the doubt.</p>
    <p>Opin­ion polls in­di­cate that around 70 per cent of the pub­lic sup­port the new mea­sures, with 45 per cent think­ing they do not go far enough and just 13 per cent say­ing they are too strict.</p>
