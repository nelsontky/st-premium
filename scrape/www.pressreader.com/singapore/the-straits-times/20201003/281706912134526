    <p>LONDON/SIN­GA­PORE • Global eq­ui­ties re­treated yes­ter­day af­ter US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump re­vealed that he and his wife had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, sparking fresh po­lit­i­cal chaos in the world’s big­gest econ­omy just one month be­fore Amer­i­cans go to the polls.</p>
    <p>The height­ened tur­moil sent US fu­tures sink­ing, while the yen and Trea­suries – of­ten seen as havens in times of mar­ket stress – rose.</p>
    <p>Wall Street’s main in­dexes tum­bled at the open yes­ter­day, with the Dow Jones In­dus­trial Av­er­age down 280.51 points, or 1.01 per cent. The S&P 500 opened lower by 41.86 points, or 1.24 per cent, while the Nas­daq Com­pos­ite dropped 243.98 points, or 2.15 per cent, at the open­ing bell.</p>
    <p>Europe’s ma­jor bourses dropped sharply at the open be­fore claw­ing back ground.</p>
    <p>Over in Asia, Sin­ga­pore’s Straits Times In­dex fell as much as 1.2 per cent af­ter the news broke, but re­gained ground to close 0.19 per cent lower yes­ter­day, amid hol­i­day clo­sures in many key Asian hubs.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s Nikkei closed down 0.7 per cent as trad­ing re­sumed fol­low­ing Thurs­day’s mar­ket shut­down caused by a tech­ni­cal fault.</p>
    <p>Oil prices tanked more than 4 per cent, ex­tend­ing Thurs­day’s heady losses that were also rooted in the mar­ket be­ing awash in crude amid timid de­mand.</p>
    <p>“The in­crease in po­lit­i­cal un­cer­tainty con­nected with Trump’s di­ag­no­sis is... weigh­ing on stocks and stock fu­tures, and sup­port­ing safe havens such as the yen, Swiss franc and the US dol­lar,” Rabobank an­a­lyst Jane Fo­ley said.</p>
    <p>In­de­pen­dent Ad­vi­sor Al­liance chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer Chris Zac­carelli said: “To the ex­tent that gov­ern­ment func­tions as nor­mal, mar­kets will be con­cerned, but not nec­es­sar­ily panic. How­ever, this in­ci­dent high­lights how Covid-19 con­tin­ues to be a threat to the econ­omy and mar­kets.”</p>
    <p>In­vestors were al­ready feel­ing pes­simistic over US law­mak­ers’ fail­ure to pass a new stim­u­lus Bill, deal­ers said. The House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives passed a US$2.2 tril­lion (S$3 tril­lion) Demo­crat-only stim­u­lus pack­age that Repub­li­cans re­ject.</p>
    <p>“We are see­ing some risk aver­sion... although, as yet, the moves we are see­ing are quite mod­est,”</p>
    <p>Oanda an­a­lyst Craig Er­lam said. “Should Trump’s health de­te­ri­o­rate, I ex­pect we would see more sig­nif­i­cant moves.”</p>
    <p>Ms Karen Ward, chief mar­ket strate­gist for Europe, the Mid­dle East and Africa at JP Mor­gan As­set Man­age­ment, said: “Mar­ket sen­ti­ment was al­ready del­i­cately bal­anced ahead of the... elec­tion, and the news only adds to the un­cer­tainty.”</p>
    <p>Still, “with such a wide range of out­comes and im­pli­ca­tions stem­ming from the Pres­i­dent’s di­ag­no­sis, it is too soon to as­cer­tain what the fi­nal mar­ket di­rec­tion will be”.</p>
