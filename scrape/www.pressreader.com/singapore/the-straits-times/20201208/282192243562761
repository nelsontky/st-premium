    <p>From fraud­u­lent screen­shots to quickly can­celled trans­ac­tions, crafty cus­tomers have found some con­ve­nient loop­holes in cash­less pay­ment sys­tems set up in lo­cal hawker cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Some 15 hawk­ers in­ter­viewed by The Straits Times said that th­ese bad ex­pe­ri­ences and losses have left them re­luc­tant to con­tinue with cash­less pay­ment sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Hawk­ers told ST that one of the key meth­ods that scam­mers used was keep­ing screen­shots of gen­uine trans­ac­tions on hand.</p>
    <p>They would then re­turn to the stall an­other day, or­der the same item and flash the screen­shot of this past trans­ac­tion quickly as proof of pay­ment.</p>
    <p>Madam Khaw Li Ling, who is in her 60s and op­er­ates a ro­jak stall at Toa Payoh West Mar­ket and Food Cen­tre, said: “Some­times, cus­tomers have very cre­ative ways of cheat­ing us – it re­quires ef­fort on their part to man­u­fac­ture a screen­shot.”</p>
    <p>She said she was once cheated out of more than $30 by a young woman who pur­chased a large amount of ro­jak dur­ing the lunch rush hour. The woman flashed what Madam Khaw said was a “scam screen­shot”.</p>
    <p>“I couldn’t be­lieve that peo­ple would go to so much trou­ble just to save $5 or $6 for a plate of ro­jak, but it’s more com­mon than you think,” Madam Khaw said.</p>
    <p>Hawk­ers said other com­mon meth­ods used were can­celled trans­ac­tions: Cus­tomers flash the pre-pay­ment page in front of hawk­ers, but do not ap­prove th­ese trans­ac­tions be­fore walk­ing away. This re­sults in cash­less trans­ac­tions not go­ing through.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese scams hap­pen most reg­u­larly dur­ing lunch hour and the din­ner rush hour when we have no time to stand around, look at our phone and wait for the money to go through,” said Mr Ooi Gim Beng, who is in his 60s and sells duck rice at a cof­fee shop in Ang Mo Kio.</p>
    <p>He said he has been cheated “around 10 to 20 times”, but has cho­sen not to pur­sue the mat­ter as the sums were un­der $10 a trans­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“We un­der­stand that there might be a lag time be­tween trans­ac­tions go­ing through on the c u s t o me r ’ s end and show­ing up on our de­vices, but just be­cause we want to be cau­tious, we can’t hold up an en­tire line of cus­tomers who want to be served quickly. It’s prob­a­bly just eas­ier to use cash,” Mr Ooi said in Man­darin.</p>
    <p>Mr Lum Sing Yew, 75, a hawker at Red­hill Mar­ket and Food Cen­tre who sells noo­dles, was also a vic­tim of such scams.</p>
    <p>He has ac­cu­mu­lated losses of some $100 to $150 since he started us­ing the QR code pay­ment sys­tem a year ago.</p>
    <p>“It re­ally hurts our earn­ings and th­ese things add up. As hawk­ers, we do not have huge prof­its,” he said in Can­tonese.</p>
    <p>“Of course, go­ing cash­less is con­ve­nient, but if there are con­sis­tent mon­e­tary losses, maybe we should just stick to cash,” he added.</p>
