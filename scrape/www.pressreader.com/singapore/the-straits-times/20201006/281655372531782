    <p>A scheme to help lo­cal com­pa­nies man­age their im­me­di­ate cash flow needs will be ex­tended for an­other six months.</p>
    <p>The Tem­po­rary Bridg­ing Loan Pro­gramme will con­tinue un­til Septem­ber next year, at re­duced lev­els, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It is one of sev­eral mea­sures that are be­ing ex­tended to en­sure “sup­port does not taper off too sharply” amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther en­hance­ments will also be made to ex­ist­ing schemes to help firms in both hard-hit sec­tors as well as those that are grow­ing.</p>
    <p>In his min­is­te­rial state­ment on the Gov­ern­ment’s strat­egy to emerge stronger from the pan­demic, Mr Heng an­nounced that the En­hanced Train­ing Sup­port Pack­age will also be ex­tended for a fur­ther six months, to June 30 next year, to pro­vide en­hanced course fee sub­si­dies for firms in hard-hit sec­tors.</p>
    <p>This will be avail­able to firms in sec­tors such as air trans­port, re­tail and tourism, as well as marine and off­shore, which was added to the list of el­i­gi­ble sec­tors yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The ab­sen­tee pay­roll rates will also be low­ered to 80 per cent from Jan­uary, capped at $7.50 per hour, in recog­ni­tion of the grad­u­ally re­cov­er­ing eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>This will help com­pa­nies pre­serve their core ca­pa­bil­i­ties and en­able work­ers to re­tain spe­cialised skills, said Mr Heng, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies and Min­is­ter for Fi­nance.</p>
    <p>The Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board and Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore (SSG) said in a joint state­ment yes­ter­day that they will work with ap­pointed train­ing part­ners to meet the de­mands of the marine and off­shore sec­tor.</p>
    <p>SSG is part­ner­ing with the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, Ngee Ann Polytech­nic, Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic and NTUC Learn­ingHub to of­fer 38 cour­ses for the sec­tor, in ar­eas such as elec­tri­cal power en­gi­neer­ing, liq­ue­fied nat­u­ral gas bunker­ing, ship­yard safety and cy­ber se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Across sec­tors, since March 1, more than 121,000 train­ing places have been taken up un­der the en­hanced train­ing sup­port pack­age, with more than 41,000 em­ploy­ees from 1,000 firms ben­e­fit­ing from the ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>Other mea­sures are also be­ing put in place and ex­tended for firms that are grow­ing.</p>
    <p>The higher tier of wage sup­port, at 50 per cent, un­der the Jobs Growth In­cen­tive (JGI) scheme, will be pro­vided to firms that hire per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties be­tween last month and Fe­bru­ary next year.</p>
    <p>The JGI, which was an­nounced in Au­gust, pro­vides up to 50 per cent of wage sup­port to firms which hire lo­cals, on the first $5,000 of gross monthly wages for up to 12 months.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral grants and pro­grammes – the Mar­ket Readi­ness As­sis­tance Grant, Pro­duc­tiv­ity So­lu­tions Grant, En­ter­prise De­vel­op­ment Grant and the Pact pro­gramme, which en­cour­ages col­lab­o­ra­tions be­tween com­pa­nies – will also be en­hanced to en­able firms to tap new sources of growth.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the Mon­e­tary Authority of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) will ex­tend the MAS Sin­ga­pore Dol­lar fa­cil­ity for En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) loans, which pro­vides lower-cost fund­ing for banks and fi­nance com­pa­nies to grant loans over­seen by ESG, un­til Septem­ber next year.</p>
    <p>Sup­port to help Sin­ga­pore en­ter­prises ac­cess fi­nanc­ing in ar­eas such as trade and project needs will also be ad­justed, Mr Heng said.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther de­tails on these sup­port mea­sures and schemes will be an­nounced by the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try and MAS.</p>
