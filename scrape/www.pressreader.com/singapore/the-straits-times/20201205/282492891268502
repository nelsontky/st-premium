    <p>The hol­i­day sea­son has tra­di­tion­ally been one of the most im­por­tant quar­ters for many busi­nesses ev­ery year. De­spite the im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic on liveli­hoods and life­style habits, on­line shop­ping has grown more pop­u­lar with peo­ple in many coun­tries, with ex­pec­ta­tions for fur­ther growth.</p>
    <p>Deloitte fore­casts on­line spend­ing to in­crease by 25 per cent to 35 per cent this hol­i­day sea­son, as con­sumers direct out­door en­ter­tain­ment and travel bud­gets to on­line shop­ping.</p>
    <p>In South-east Asia, the e-com­merce boom is ex­pected to ex­ceed US$150 bil­lion (S$199.85 bil­lion) by 2025, hav­ing in­creased by al­most 600 per cent in the last four years.</p>
    <p>Asia’s 11.11 Sin­gles’ Day – which has sur­passed Black Fri­day and Cy­ber Mon­day as the world’s largest shop­ping day – raked in US$74 bil­lion this year, ex­ceed­ing last year’s US$56.58 bil­lion record high.</p>
    <p>With e-com­merce ac­cel­er­at­ing rapidly, how can re­tail­ers pre­pare to ride the hol­i­day sea­son wave and grow their busi­ness?</p>
    <p>Here are four rec­om­men­da­tions.</p>
    <p>1 OF­FER REA­SON­ABLE SHIP­PING COSTS</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the SAP Con­sumer Propen­sity Re­port, ship­ping cost is the main rea­son why con­sumers in the Asia-Pa­cific aban­don their carts.</p>
    <p>In PayPal’s Bor­der­less Com­merce Re­port, some 53 per cent of Sin­ga­pore­ans said they did not pur­chase an item on ac­count of ship­ping costs and 57 per cent were at­tracted to free ship­ping.</p>
    <p>For in­ter­na­tional mer­chants look­ing to grow their con­sumer base, they can gain an ad­van­tage by ei­ther in­cor­po­rat­ing ship­ping costs into the price of the prod­uct, us­ing flat ship­ping rates or of­fer­ing a min­i­mum pur­chase value so con­sumers feel they have re­ceived good value for their money.</p>
    <p>2 PRO­VIDE FLEX­I­BLE AND LU­CRA­TIVE PRICES AND OF­FERS</p>
    <p>Savvy shop­pers and con­sumers are al­ways look­ing for ways to save money, so it re­ally goes the ex­tra mile when busi­nesses sup­port them in find­ing items at prices within their bud­get range.</p>
    <p>This is some­thing busi­nesses can of­fer rel­a­tively eas­ily and quickly. By en­abling shop­ping and pro­mo­tion tools which help shop­pers source for on­line coupons, PayPal has seen 180 per cent net growth in new ac­tive con­sumers com­pared with pre-Covid-19 lev­els.</p>
    <p>3 HONE IN ON CUSTOMER SER­VICE AND EX­PE­RI­ENCE</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers like choice and op­tions in pur­chas­ing, and be­lieve it is their pre­rog­a­tive to change their minds, es­pe­cially when they can­not touch or try a prod­uct when buy­ing on­line. A cru­cial busi­ness strat­egy that re­tail­ers should cater to, where a dig­i­tal shop­per is con­cerned, is to in­cor­po­rate on­line to off­line mar­ket­ing, which are e-com­merce ser­vices such as on­line in­for­ma­tion and dis­counts or ser­vices that en­hance a customer’s off­line ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, busi­nesses can of­fer curb­side pickup for buy­ers who want to pay on­line but pick up in-store, or al­low on­line pur­chases to be re­turned in-store to im­prove over­all customer sat­is­fac­tion.</p>
    <p>To fur­ther en­gage with cus­tomers, busi­nesses can build in on­line to off­line e-mail mar­ket­ing – such as nudg­ing cus­tomers who aban­doned their cart with an in­cen­tive to check out.</p>
    <p>4 SE­CURE AND SEAM­LESS PAY­MENTS</p>
    <p>It is es­ti­mated that about 30 per cent of global re­tail sales this hol­i­day will be from e-com­merce. This un­prece­dented spike is a good in­di­ca­tor for busi­nesses to strengthen their pay­ment plat­forms to en­able them to man­age the in­crease in trans­ac­tions seam­lessly.</p>
    <p>Stream­lin­ing pay­ment pro­cess­ing will fa­cil­i­tate eas­ier and faster trou­bleshoot­ing for re­tail­ers.</p>
    <p>Com­bin­ing their pay­ment needs un­der a sin­gle provider may save re­tail­ers the has­sle of deal­ing with mul­ti­ple check­out ven­dors and sup­port teams.</p>
    <p>How­ever, one should en­sure that the provider has suf­fi­cient ca­pac­ity and re­dun­dancy in case of po­ten­tial out­ages.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the in­creas­ing se­cu­rity con­cerns while shop­ping on­line has ac­cel­er­ated the adop­tion of dig­i­tal wal­lets among on­line shop­pers. Dig­i­tal wal­lets that in­clude data en­cryp­tion to keep pay­ments safe, pre­vent fraud and pro­vide buyer pro­tec­tion pro­vide a higher level of trust.</p>
    <p>A re­cent Ac­cen­ture Covid-19 Con­sumer Pulse study found the rise in on­line shop­ping is here to stay for the long term, with a pro­jected 169 per cent in­crease in e-com­merce pur­chases from new or low-fre­quency users post-out­break.</p>
    <p>As re­tail­ers gear up for the busiest quar­ter of the year, they need to be ready to op­ti­mise op­er­a­tions to at­tract cus­tomers and drive sales in the new nor­mal and beyond.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the SAP Con­sumer Propen­sity Re­port, ship­ping cost is the main rea­son why con­sumers in the Asia-Pa­cific aban­don their carts.</p>
