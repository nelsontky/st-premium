    <p>BERLIN • Coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions con­tinue to flare up in Europe, where Ger­many recorded more than 1,000 new cases for the third con­sec­u­tive day and Spain re­ported its high­est num­ber of daily in­fec­tions since April.</p>
    <p>Ger­many yes­ter­day re­ported 1,707 new cases of the coro­n­avirus in the past 24 hours, the high­est daily toll since the peak of the pan­demic in April. The coun­try has fared bet­ter than many Euro­pean neigh­bours in sup­press­ing the virus so far, but like else­where, the num­ber of cases has jumped sig­nif­i­cantly over the sum­mer hol­i­days. Schools al­ready re­sumed last week in parts of Ger­many.</p>
    <p>Faced with the surge in cases, Ger­many ear­lier this month in­tro­duced free, manda­tory tests for any­one re­turn­ing from ar­eas deemed at high risk for Covid-19 in­fec­tions. And Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel warned this week that there could be no fur­ther re­lax­ation of coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>France on Wed­nes­day recorded new coro­n­avirus cases at the fastest daily rate since May. Al­most 3,800 Covid-19 in­fec­tions were con­firmed in the past 24 hours, said the Health Min­istry’s DGS pub­lic health di­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron ruled out an­other na­tion­wide lock­down, say­ing the coun­try will rely on lo­cal strate­gies to curb a resur­gence of the virus.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, Spain recorded 6,700 new in­fec­tions in 24 hours, bring­ing the to­tal to more than 370,000, the high­est caseload in West­ern Europe. The toll rose above 380,000 last night.</p>
    <p>Ukraine yes­ter­day also re­ported a record daily in­crease in coro­n­avirus cases, ex­ceed­ing 2,000 new in­fec­tions for the first time.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, Europe can com­bat the pan­demic with­out full lock­downs now that the author­i­ties are bet­ter pre­pared and have gained knowl­edge on how to fight it in re­cent months, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“With the ba­sic na­tion­wide and ad­di­tional tar­geted mea­sures, we are in a much bet­ter po­si­tion to stamp out these lo­calised virus flare-ups,” said Dr Hans Kluge, head of the WHO’s Euro­pean branch.</p>
