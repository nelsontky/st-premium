    <p>SYD­NEY • Qan­tas Air­ways has an­nounced plans to cut up to 2,500 more jobs by out­sourc­ing its Aus­tralian ground-han­dling oper­a­tions to lower costs, as it braces it­self for a A$10 bil­lion (S$9.8 bil­lion) rev­enue hit in this fi­nan­cial year due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The job cuts flagged yes­ter­day are on top of 6,000 cuts across Qan­tas’ work­force an­nounced in June, which would take the to­tal j ob losses to nearly 30 per cent of its pre-pan­demic staffing.</p>
    <p>Fin­land’s na­tional car­rier Fin­nair also plans to elim­i­nate as much as 15 per cent of its work­force and push through deeper cost cuts.</p>
    <p>The air­line will slash a max­i­mum of 1,000 jobs and lay off “prac­ti­cally all of its per­son­nel in Fin­land”, it said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Qan­tas’ head of do­mes­tic oper­a­tions An­drew David said out­sourc­ing ground-han­dling jobs at the coun­try’s big­gest air­ports would save an es­ti­mated A$100 mil­lion each year in op­er­at­ing costs.</p>
    <p>“It would match our ground-han­dling ser­vices with fluc­tu­at­ing lev­els of de­mand,” Mr David told re­porters at a brief­ing. “We know an ex­ter­nal party can turn our air­craft at 40 per cent lower cost than we can us­ing our re­sources.”</p>
    <p>It would also al­low the air­line to avoid in­vest­ing A$100 mil­lion in equip­ment such as tugs and bag load­ers over the next five years by out­sourc­ing the work to a spe­cial­ist ground han­dler, said Mr Gareth</p>
    <p>Evans, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Jet­star, Qan­tas’ bud­get arm.</p>
    <p>The ex­ec­u­tives did not name the firms that could be in­volved in the out­sourc­ing, but ma­jor ground han­dlers in Aus­tralia in­clude dnata, Swis­s­port and Men­zies Avi­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Qan­tas shares were up 1.7 per cent yes­ter­day af­ter­noon, com­pared with a 0.2 per cent rise in the broader mar­ket.</p>
    <p>As part of a union agree­ment, Qan­tas said it would also have to of­fer the op­por­tu­nity for the 2,000 ground han­dlers at its main brand to bid for the work, though it will not have to do so at Jet­star.</p>
    <p>The air­line said it would com­plete its review over the next few months. Most of its ground-han­dling em­ploy­ees have been stood down from work for months and are re­ceiv­ing gov­ern­ment aid due to the de­cline in travel de­mand.</p>
