    <p>Re­search into the hu­man genome has grown over the past decade but Asian pop­u­la­tions re­main un­der­stud­ied.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Liu Jian­jun, 57, is try­ing to change that – and gain­ing recog­ni­tion for it. Last Fri­day, he re­ceived the Pres­i­dent’s Science Award.</p>
    <p>“My re­search on the ge­net­ics of Asian pop­u­la­tions has re­vealed new in­sights into the bi­o­log­i­cal mech­a­nisms of dis­eases that are promi­nent in Asian pop­u­la­tions,” said Prof Liu, deputy ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor at the Agency for Science, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search’s Genome In­sti­tute of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>This will help in the de­vel­op­ment of clin­i­cal tests to look for such Asian “biomark­ers”, which will al­low doc­tors to di­ag­nose pa­tients early, and help pre­vent ad­verse re­ac­tions to drugs, he added.</p>
    <p>Prof Liu was part of a team that dis­cov­ered the spe­cific risk strains of the Ep­stein-Barr virus (EBV), which are as­so­ci­ated with the de­vel­op­ment of na­sopha­ryn­geal car­ci­noma.</p>
    <p>This nose can­cer is found largely in pop­u­la­tions in South China and South-east Asia, but is very rare in other re­gions.</p>
    <p>The EBV risk strains can be used as biomark­ers to iden­tify in­di­vid­u­als with high risk of de­vel­op­ing the can­cer, en­abling early di­ag­no­sis and im­proved sur­vival rates.</p>
    <p>Prof Liu is one of two re­cip­i­ents of the Pres­i­dent’s Science Award this year.</p>
    <p>The award is one of three prizes un­der the Pres­i­dent’s Science and Tech­nol­ogy Awards – the high­est recog­ni­tion for ex­cep­tional re­search sci­en­tists and engi­neers here.</p>
    <p>The other Pres­i­dent’s Science Award went to a trio from Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity for their re­search into topo­log­i­cal nanopho­ton­ics – a field in the science of light that has emerged in the past decade.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Niko­lay Zhe­ludev, 65, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Chong Yi­dong, 40, and As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Zhang Baile, 39, found that ma­nip­u­lat­ing light at the nano-level – an ex­tremely small scale – could al­low sci­en­tists to probe ob­jects such as viruses that are too small to be seen un­der a con­ven­tional mi­cro­scope.</p>
    <p>Pho­ton­ics, the science of gen­er­at­ing, har­ness­ing and ma­nip­u­lat­ing light, is a crit­i­cal en­abling tech­nol­ogy of the 21st cen­tury, un­der­pin­ning nu­mer­ous other tech­nolo­gies rang­ing from imag­ing to se­cu­rity and de­fence, the re­search team told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pect that our re­search in­no­va­tions will lead to higher-den­sity op­ti­cal chips, more ro­bust and com­pact lasers, universal su­per-res­o­lu­tion op­ti­cal imag­ing for ap­pli­ca­tions across var­i­ous tech­nolo­gies, such as those used in the life sciences and biomed­i­cal in­dus­tries, as well as ul­tra-fast 6G telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions,” they said.</p>
