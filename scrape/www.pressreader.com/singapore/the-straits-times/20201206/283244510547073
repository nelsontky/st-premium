    <p>Pro­fes­sional women foot­ballers are to be guar­an­teed maternity leave un­der new rules ap­proved by Fifa on Fri­day, the global foot­ball gov­ern­ing body’s pres­i­dent Gianni In­fantino said.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new rules, ap­proved by the de­ci­sion-mak­ing Fifa coun­cil on Fri­day, a player will be given 14 weeks’ maternity leave and her club will be obliged to rein­te­grate her after­wards and pro­vide ad­e­quate med­i­cal sup­port.</p>
    <p>“If we are se­ri­ous about boost­ing the women’s game, we have to look at all these as­pects,” In­fantino told re­porters. “Fe­male play­ers need to have sta­bil­ity in their ca­reers and if they take maternity l eave, they should not have to worry about when they are ready to play again.”</p>
    <p>The rules will be in­cor­po­rated into Fifa’s reg­u­la­tions on the sta­tus and trans­fer of play­ers and will be en­forced world­wide.</p>
    <p>In­fantino said new rules would also be in­tro­duced to give greater sta­bil­ity to coaches, although there were no im­me­di­ate fur­ther de­tails.</p>
    <p>“Coaches de­velop how we play and in­spire the play­ers, they too need job se­cu­rity and we have es­tab­lished min­i­mum stan­dards to pro­tect them,” he said.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil also de­cided to stage an ad­di­tional edi­tion of its old-style Club World Cup, fea­tur­ing seven teams in­clud­ing the cham­pi­ons of each con­ti­nent, in Ja­pan next year.</p>
    <p>A new-style tour­na­ment, fea­tur­ing 24 teams, is due to be played in China in 2022, hav­ing been put back one year be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We will have the best club com­pe­ti­tion in the world,” said In­fantino.</p>
