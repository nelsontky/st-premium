    <p>The Mar­itime and Port Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore’s next-gen­er­a­tion pa­trol craft sprang into ac­tion after around 10,000 tonnes of crude oil “spilled” fol­low­ing a col­li­sion of two oil tankers in Sin­ga­pore’s waters yesterday morn­ing. The oil spill ex­er­cise en­abled the new ves­sels to demon­strate their abil­ity to man­age such in­ci­dents more ef­fi­ciently.</p>
    <p>There was lit­tle time to waste as around 10,000 tonnes of crude oil had “spilled” after a col­li­sion of two oil tankers in Sin­ga­pore’s waters yesterday morn­ing.</p>
    <p>The Mar­itime and Port Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore’s (MPA) next-gen­er­a­tion pa­trol craft sprung into ac­tion once they reached the scene, swiftly set­ting up por­ta­ble spill con­tain­ment booms around the “oil spill” to pre­vent it from spread­ing, and de­ploy­ing spray­ing sys­tems to break up the oil par­ti­cles.</p>
    <p>The oil spill ex­er­cise en­abled the new ves­sels, launched last month, to demon­strate their abil­ity to man­age such in­ci­dents more ef­fi­ciently.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the ves­sel is able to de­ploy the spill con­tain­ment booms within half an hour. Pre­vi­ously, this process could take four to eight hours, said Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port and For­eign Af­fairs Chee Hong Tat, who at­tended the ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the me­dia after the ex­er­cise, he said: “That is a good first re­sponse, to al­low MPA, when they ar­rive on site, to be able to con­tain the oil spill be­fore fur­ther re­in­force­ments are called upon.”</p>
    <p>The ex­er­cise in­volved around 100 peo­ple from the MPA, the Po­lice Coast Guard, the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force (SCDF) and pri­vate com­pa­nies in­clud­ing Exxon-Mo­bil Asia Pa­cific, Oil Spill Re­sponse and Sin­ga­pore Sal­vage En­gi­neers.</p>
    <p>Some 15 ves­sels were in­volved in the ex­er­cise, in­clud­ing four nextgen­er­a­tion pa­trol craft, and the SCDF’s Ma­rine Res­cue Ves­sel and Rapid Re­sponse Fire Ves­sel, which put up a water cur­tain to pre­vent “fires” from erupt­ing, and to dis­perse toxic fumes.</p>
    <p>An “oc­to­pus” skim­mer sys­tem was also used to skim the oil off the sur­face of the water, while drones were de­ployed to as­sess the sit­u­a­tion from above.</p>
    <p>Mr Chee said it is im­por­tant to do such ex­er­cises reg­u­larly, as the agen­cies have to prac­tise re­spond­ing to dif­fer­ent kinds of sce­nar­ios, and in­cor­po­rate new tech­nol­ogy in their op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>When asked if Sin­ga­pore would be able to man­age large-scale in­ci­dents like the Mau­ri­tius oil spill in July which leaked over 1,000 tonnes of fuel, Mr Chee said the au­thor­i­ties can learn from the best prac­tices and mis­takes that have been made.</p>
    <p>“Learn­ing and shar­ing, I think, are very im­por­tant ways to help every­one... deal with oil spills bet­ter.”</p>
