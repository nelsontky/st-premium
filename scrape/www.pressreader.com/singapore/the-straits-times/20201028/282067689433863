    <p>Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob re­mains in the top 50 of a list of the world’s 500 most in­flu­en­tial Mus­lims, com­piled by the Royal Is­lamic Strate­gic Stud­ies Cen­tre in Jor­dan.</p>
    <p>At No. 37, Madam Hal­imah, who was elected Sin­ga­pore’s first woman pres­i­dent in 2017, is the only Sin­ga­porean in the top 50 of the 2021 edi­tion of The Mus­lim 500.</p>
    <p>The an­nual com­pi­la­tion, in its 12th year, ranks Mus­lims around the world ac­cord­ing to the ex­tent of their im­pact on their com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Her award ci­ta­tion said: “As pres­i­dent, she has pro­moted ini­tia­tives for sup­port­ing a co­he­sive so­ci­ety, strength­en­ing in­ter­faith (bonds) and recog­nis­ing all work­ers who con­trib­ute to Sin­ga­pore’s growth. She has a strong in­ter­na­tional pro­file, reg­u­larly meet­ing world lead­ers.”</p>
    <p>Last year saw the in­au­gu­ral In­ter­na­tional Con­fer­ence on Co­he­sive So­ci­eties in Sin­ga­pore, which drew about 1,000 del­e­gates from al­most 40 coun­tries, af­ter Pres­i­dent Hal­imah had put forth the idea of a unique in­ter­faith fo­rum.</p>
    <p>She has been climb­ing the rank­ings since her in­clu­sion in 2018 at the 45th spot. Last year, she was ranked 41st, and this year she was in the 38th spot.</p>
    <p>Also in the top 50 were three oth­ers from South-east Asia. In­done­sian Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo was ranked 12th; Pro­fes­sor K.H. Said Aqil Si­radj, chair­man of In­done­sia’s Nahd­latul Ulama, was in the 18th spot; and In­done­sian preacher Habib Luthfi Yahya was 32nd.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre also named Ms Bilkis Bano from In­dia as Woman of the Year. At 82, she is famed for her re­sis­tance to her coun­try’s con­tro­ver­sial Cit­i­zen­ship Amend­ment Act. Man of the Year was econ­o­mist Il­ham To­hti, 51, from China, who ad­vo­cates for the rights of the Uighur mi­nor­ity.</p>
