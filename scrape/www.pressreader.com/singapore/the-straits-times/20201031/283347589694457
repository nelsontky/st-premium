    <p>SEOUL • K-pop boy band Exo are in the news again af­ter one of their mem­bers, Chanyeol, was accused of cheat­ing by an al­leged ex-girl­friend.</p>
    <p>In an on­line post which has since been deleted, the ne­ti­zen claimed that she had dated Chanyeol, whose real name is Park Chanyeol, for al­most three years be­fore they broke up re­cently.</p>
    <p>She claimed that she had kept their re­la­tion­ship un­der wraps to pro­tect his ca­reer, but he had cheated on her by see­ing other girls.</p>
    <p>She also posted sev­eral pho­tos of Chanyeol, 27, al­legedly with her, al­though the per­son be­side him was blacked out from the pho­tos. She also claimed to have record­ings of some of their con­ver­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Exo’s man­age­ment la­bel SM</p>
    <p>En­ter­tain­ment said i n a me­dia state­ment on Thurs­day that it would not re­act to the post.</p>
    <p>It is not known if the re­lease of Chanyeol’s up­com­ing movie The Box, in which he will make his first star­ring role, will be af­fected by the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Chen, an­other mem­ber of Exo, was in the news in Jan­uary af­ter the 28-year-old an­nounced he was get­ting mar­ried be­cause his then girl­friend (now wife) was preg­nant.</p>
    <p>Some fans of the nine-mem­ber band took to the streets in protest as they la­belled Chen, whose real name is Kim Jong-dae, a “be­trayer” and called on him to leave the group.</p>
    <p>His wife, who is not in show busi­ness, gave birth to a girl in April.</p>
    <p>Chen was en­listed in manda­tory mil­i­tary ser­vice on Mon­day.</p>
