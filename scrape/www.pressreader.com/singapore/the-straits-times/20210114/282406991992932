        <p>Mr Stefan Thomas, a Ger­man-born pro­gram­mer liv­ing in San Fran­cisco, has two guesses left to fig­ure out a pass­word that is worth, as of this week, about US$220 mil­lion (S$292 mil­lion). The pass­word will let him un­lock a small hard drive, known as an IronKey, which con­tains the pri­vate keys to a dig­i­tal wal­let that holds 7,002 bit­coins.</p>
        <p>While the price of bit­coin dropped sharply on Mon­day, it is still up more than 50 per cent from just a month ago when it passed its pre­vi­ous all-time high of around US$20,000.</p>
        <p>The prob­lem is that years ago, Mr Thomas lost the pa­per where he wrote down the pass­word for his IronKey, which gives users 10 guesses be­fore it seizes up and en­crypts its con­tents for­ever.</p>
        <p>He has since tried eight of his most com­monly used pass­word for­mu­la­tions – to no avail. “I would just lay in bed and think about it,” he said. “Then I would go to the com­puter with some new strat­egy, and it wouldn’t work and I would be des­per­ate again.”</p>
        <p>Bit­coin has made a lot of its hold­ers very rich in a short pe­riod of time. But the cryp­tocur­rency’s un­usual na­ture has also meant that there are many peo­ple who are locked out of their bit­coin for­tunes as a re­sult of lost or for­got­ten keys. They have been forced to watch, help­less, as the price has risen and fallen dra­mat­i­cally, un­able to cash in on their dig­i­tal wealth.</p>
        <p>Of the ex­ist­ing 18.5 mil­lion bit­coins, around 20 per cent – cur­rently worth around US$140 bil­lion – ap­pear to be in lost or oth­er­wise stranded wal­lets, ac­cord­ing to cryp­tocur­rency data firm Chainal­y­sis. Wal­let Re­cov­ery Ser</p>
        <p>vices, a business that helps find lost dig­i­tal keys, said it gets 70 re­quests a day from peo­ple who want help re­cov­er­ing their riches, three times the num­ber a month ago.</p>
        <p>“Through the years, I would say I have spent hundreds of hours try</p>
        <p>ing to get back into these wal­lets,” said Mr Brad Yasar, an en­tre­pre­neur in Los An­ge­les who has a few desk­top com­put­ers that con­tain thou­sands of bit­coins he cre­ated, or mined, dur­ing the early days of the tech­nol­ogy. While those bit</p>
        <p>coins are now worth hundreds of mil­lions of dol­lars, he lost his pass­words many years ago and has put the hard drives con­tain­ing them in vac­uum-sealed bags, out of sight.</p>
        <p>With tra­di­tional bank ac­counts and online wal­lets, banks like</p>
        <p>Wells Fargo and other fi­nan­cial com­pa­nies like PayPal can pro­vide peo­ple the pass­words to their ac­counts or re­set lost pass­words.</p>
        <p>But bit­coin has no com­pany to pro­vide or store pass­words. Its cre­ator, a shad­owy fig­ure known as Satoshi Nakamoto, has said bit­coin’s cen­tral idea was to al­low any­one to open a dig­i­tal bank ac­count and hold the money in a way that no gov­ern­ment could pre­vent or reg­u­late.</p>
        <p>This is made pos­si­ble by the struc­ture of bit­coin, which is gov­erned by a net­work of com­put­ers that agreed to fol­low soft­ware con­tain­ing all the rules for the cryp­tocur­rency. The soft­ware in­cludes a com­plex al­go­rithm that makes it pos­si­ble to cre­ate an ad­dress, and as­so­ci­ated pri­vate key, which is known only by the per­son who cre­ated the wal­let.</p>
        <p>The soft­ware also al­lows the bit­coin net­work to con­firm the ac­cu­racy of the pass­word to al­low trans­ac­tions, with­out see­ing or know­ing the pass­word it­self. In short, the sys­tem makes it pos­si­ble for any­one to cre­ate a bit­coin wal­let with­out hav­ing to reg­is­ter with a fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion or go through any sort of iden­tity check.</p>
        <p>But the struc­ture of this sys­tem did not ac­count for just how bad peo­ple can be at re­mem­ber­ing and se­cur­ing their pass­words.</p>
        <p>BIT­COIN HOLD­INGS OUT­SOURCED</p>
        <p>Other bit­coin be­liev­ers have also re­alised the dif­fi­cul­ties of be­ing their own bank. Some have out­sourced the work of hold­ing bit­coin to start-ups and ex­changes that se­cure the pri­vate keys to peo­ple’s stashes of bit­coins.</p>
        <p>Yet some of these ser­vices have had just as much trou­ble se­cur­ing their keys. Many of the largest bit­coin ex­changes over the years – in­clud­ing the one-time well-known ex­change, Mt Gox – have lost pri­vate keys or had them stolen.</p>
        <p>At least, Mr Thomas said he has man­aged to hold onto enough bit­coins – and re­mem­ber the pass­words – to give him more riches than he knows what to do with.</p>
        <p>As for his lost pass­word and in­ac­ces­si­ble bit­coins, he has put the IronKey in a se­cure fa­cil­ity – in case cryp­tog­ra­phers come up with new ways of crack­ing com­plex pass­words.</p>
