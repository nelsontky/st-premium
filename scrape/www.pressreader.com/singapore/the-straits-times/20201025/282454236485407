    <p>In the home stretch of writ­ing her sec­ond novel, The Shadow King, au­thor Maaza Mengiste and her mother re­turned to her birth coun­try of Ethiopia for a 10-day road trip.</p>
    <p>The Shadow King brings to light Ethiopia’s un­sung women war­riors, who took on Mus­solini’s in­vad­ing Ital­ian army in 1935. Mengiste, 49, did not want to turn in her fi­nal draft with­out re­vis­it­ing the land in which those she wrote about had fought, bled and died.</p>
    <p>It was on the 10th day, as they re­turned to Ad­dis Ababa and pre­pared to go to sleep, that Mengiste’s mother said to her ca­su­ally: “What about your great­grand­mother?”</p>
    <p>Mengiste was stunned. She had spent nine years work­ing on the novel. In all this time, she had had no idea that her great-grand­mother had gone to war; that she had been thought too young to en­list but did so any­way; and that be­cause the mil­i­tary did not pro­vide weapons, she had sued her fa­ther for their fam­ily gun and won.</p>
    <p>“Why didn’t you tell me this?” Mengiste de­manded. “This is such im­por­tant news for me.”</p>
    <p>“Well,” said her mother, “you didn’t ask.”</p>
    <p>“It makes me think about all of the sto­ries that get lost, be­cause the sto­ries of women are not counted as his­tory,” says Mengiste in a tele­phone in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>“It’s the sto­ries men tell each other at a party, in the class­rooms and board­rooms, that get writ­ten down in text­books and be­come his­tory. But what women share with each other in kitchens, in homes, in the places they gather, is not looked at as his­tory. I hope that be­gins to change.”</p>
    <p>She is speak­ing from her home in Queens, New York. From time to time, a siren rends the air. The city, she says, is hav­ing a fresh surge of Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Born in Ad­dis Ababa, she was four when her fam­ily was forced to flee dur­ing the 1970s Ethiopian Rev­o­lu­tion, a pe­riod she writes about in her first novel, Be­neath The Lion’s Gaze (2010).</p>
    <p>They moved to Nige­ria, Kenya and fi­nally the United States.</p>
    <p>While she re­mem­bers very lit­tle of her early years in Amer­ica, she has star­tlingly clear rec­ol­lec­tions of Ethiopia, some of her hap­pi­est mem­o­ries – birth­day par­ties, play­ing with neigh­bours – mixed in with those of gun­fire in the night, cur­fews and the way peo­ple be­came afraid to speak freely.</p>
    <p>Her par­ents made sure she grew up with sto­ries of Ethiopian his­tory, such as the 1935 war. “In the United States, where racism is such an is­sue, other Amer­i­cans – other white Amer­i­cans – did not let me for­get I was dif­fer­ent. But be­cause my par­ents re­minded me, I be­lieved that my dif­fer­ence as an Ethiopian was noth­ing to be ashamed of.”</p>
    <p>Women have been ac­tive in war long be­fore 1935 and all over the world, she notes, but th­ese sto­ries of­ten go un­told. “War is what makes a boy into a man. So what does it mean to have a woman at war? All th­ese def­i­ni­tions of mas­culin­ity get com­pletely up­ended.”</p>
    <p>In the clas­sic war sto­ries, such as</p>
    <p>Homer’s The Iliad, women are the cause of war, its tro­phies and the ter­ri­tory on which it is fought.</p>
    <p>“I wanted to think about the re­al­i­ties that I know, how myths could change if they were adapted to what ac­tu­ally hap­pened. I wanted those women to rise up and push back.”</p>
    <p>When her ed­i­tor called her to tell her she had been short­listed for the Booker, she be­gan scream­ing into the phone. Then she started shak­ing all over.</p>
    <p>“It was af­firm­ing,” she says. “It told me that I was part of a con­ver­sa­tion, that I was not alone in this, that there were other peo­ple who wanted to know more.</p>
    <p>“There have been women and girls who have come to me and shared sto­ries, not nec­es­sar­ily con­nected to war but maybe to sex­ual as­sault, or to acts of re­sis­tance in dif­fer­ent ways, to step­ping for­ward when no one thought that they should even speak up.</p>
    <p>“It makes the world feel smaller, and it re­minds me that in many ways, we are a com­mu­nity.”</p>
