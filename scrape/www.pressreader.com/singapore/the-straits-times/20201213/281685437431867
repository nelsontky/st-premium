    <p>Mr Cle­ment Wang’s trainee­ship at Rong Xing Yong Tau Fu be­gan af­ter a chance en­counter in Jan­uary when, while queue­ing at the Tan­jong Pa­gar Plaza stall, he told the hawker he wanted to learn how to make her tofu and meat­balls.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang, 34, who then had an air­line cabin crew job, felt he had no way of get­ting into the trade de­spite his in­ter­est, as his only ex­pe­ri­ence was when he had helped out part-time in a restau­rant kitchen at the age of 19.</p>
    <p>But vet­eran stallholde­r Tee Chun Moy, 60, said she would be happy to take him on.</p>
    <p>The two later be­gan work­ing to­gether un­der a Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency hawker devel­op­ment pro­gramme, which pairs a hawker with a trainee for two months. By then, Mr Wang, who is sin­gle, could no longer fly, with planes grounded by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He said he was mo­ti­vated to be a hawker by his ex­pe­ri­ences over­seas as an air­line em­ployee.</p>
    <p>“At any point, I could think of five to 10 hawker foods I wanted to eat when I was over­seas. You can go to a hawker cen­tre for a month and not be sick of it,” he said. Hav­ing in­terned for 11/ months,</p>
    <p>2 he will be ready to open his own yong tau foo stall soon.</p>
    <p>“I am think­ing of giv­ing the tra­di­tional yong tau foo a twist by of­fer­ing set meals. But I will keep fo­cus­ing on the spe­cial­i­ties she has taught me – the hand­made in­gre­di­ents, the soup, the sauces,” he said.</p>
    <p>Rong Xing Yong Tau Fu was opened 36 years ago when Madam Tee bor­rowed money from her fa­ther to ven­ture into the trade.</p>
    <p>Madam Tee, whose recipes were taught to her by her grand­mother, is not wary of pass­ing them on to those out­side her fam­ily, even with her 19-year-old daugh­ter help­ing out at the stall some­times.</p>
    <p>She wants to keep hawker cul­ture alive by get­ting more young peo­ple in­volved, es­pe­cially be­cause her daugh­ter might go on to take a reg­u­lar 9-to-5 job.</p>
    <p>Asked if she was wor­ried about fu­ture com­pe­ti­tion from trainees like Mr Wang, she said: “It may be the same recipe but ev­ery­one’s craft is dif­fer­ent. The taste will end up be­ing dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore is not very big but there is a mar­ket for food. There is no need to be self­ish about this.”</p>
    <p>She has men­tored three oth­ers so far. Suc­cess has var­ied, from one who has opened his own yong tau foo stall at the ABC Brick­works food cen­tre, to an­other who stopped the trainee­ship af­ter just four days be­cause he de­cided the 16-hour days were not worth it.</p>
    <p>Madam Tee said she is used to the tough work­ing con­di­tions. Her cus­tomers’ praise and grow­ing suc­cess over the years keep her go­ing.</p>
    <p>“I have pa­trons from Hong Kong, Tai­wan and Ja­pan who praise my food on their blogs,” she said. “I’ll keep do­ing this un­til I re­tire, and even then, I’ll think of how to sell smaller home­made yong tau foo in­gre­di­ents.”</p>
    <p>It may be the same recipe but ev­ery­one’s craft is dif­fer­ent. The taste will end up be­ing dif­fer­ent. Sin­ga­pore is not very big but there is a mar­ket for food. There is no need to be self­ish about this.</p>
