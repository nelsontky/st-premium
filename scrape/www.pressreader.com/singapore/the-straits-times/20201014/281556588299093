    <p>The drama Wet Sea­son, writ­ten and di­rected by An­thony Chen, has been se­lected by the Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>Film Com­mis­sion as the na­tion’s en­try into next year’s Academy Awards in the In­ter­na­tional</p>
    <p>Fea­ture Film cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>The drama Wet Sea­son has been se­lected by the Sin­ga­pore Film Com­mis­sion (SFC) as the na­tion’s en­try into next year’s Academy Awards in the In­ter­na­tional Fea­ture Film cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>The film, writ­ten and di­rected by An­thony Chen and re­leased last year, stars Yeo Yann Yann and Koh Jia Ler as a teacher and a stu­dent re­spec­tively, each coping with emo­tional stresses at home.</p>
    <p>At the 56th Golden Horse Awards, held last year, the film earned six nom­i­na­tions, in­clud­ing Best Fea­ture Film and Best Direc­tor for Chen. It won one award, for Yeo, who took home the Best Lead­ing Ac­tress prize.</p>
    <p>Wet Sea­son is Chen’s sec­ond fea­ture as writer-direc­tor. His first, the fam­ily drama Ilo Ilo (2013), was se­lected as Sin­ga­pore’s en­try to the 86th Academy Awards, held i n 2014.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yesterday an­nounc­ing the se­lec­tion of the film as Sin­ga­pore’s en­try to the Os­cars, to be held on April 25, SFC direc­tor Joachim Ng said: “It is a thought-pro­vok­ing film which ex­plores human re­la­tion­ships and emo­tions through the lens of a cen­tral fe­male char­ac­ter grap­pling with her per­sonal iden­tity and mar­riage.</p>
    <p>“The film has been well re­ceived by au­di­ences in sev­eral film fes­ti­vals and we are proud to con­tinue sup­port­ing more made-with-Sin­ga­pore films that transcend bound­aries and evoke con­ver­sa­tions.”</p>
    <p>Chen, 36, who is based in Lon­don, told The Straits Times: “Wet Sea­son is a labour of love, we couldn’t have done it with­out the ac­tors and crew who worked tire­lessly on this film. I am honoured and hum­bled that this film will rep­re­sent Sin­ga­pore at the Os­cars and hope that the film will con­tinue to be seen and move au­di­ences be­yond Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>No Sin­ga­pore film has made it to the short­list of the Os­cars in this cat­e­gory, which was pre­vi­ously known as Best For­eign Lan­guage Film.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s sub­mis­sions in pre­vi­ous years in­clude the drama A Land Imag­ined (in 2019), western Buf­falo Boys (2018) and set-in-Thai­land road movie Pop Aye (2017).</p>
