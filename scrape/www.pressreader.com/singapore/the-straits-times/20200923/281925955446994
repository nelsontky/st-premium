    <p>SYD­NEY Res­cuers yes­ter­day set free around 25 whales that were ma­rooned on a sand­bar off the re­mote west coast of Tas­ma­nia in one of Aus­tralia’s worst beach­ing events, and hope to save more in the com­ing days.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists said about 90 of the 270-strong pod of pi­lot whales have died since they were spot­ted from the air in shallow wa­ter off the rugged coast­line on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Footage showed large num­bers of the whales prone on a wide sand­bar at Mac­quarie Har­bour, about 200km north-west of the state cap­i­tal Ho­bart, while oth­ers floun­dered in slightly deeper wa­ter.</p>
    <p>Over 60 peo­ple are in­volved in the res­cue ef­fort, in­clud­ing lo­cal fish­er­men and vol­un­teers. Res­cuers had to get in the icy wa­ter to</p>
    <p>at­tach the whales – a species of oceanic dol­phin that can grow to 7m long and can weigh up to 3 tonnes – to slings and then guide them as boats dragged them out to deeper wa­ter.</p>
    <p>“We set­tled on a method where we get a sling placed un­der the whale, that’s at­tached to a boat (and) we also have crew in the wa­ter,” re­gional man­ager Nic Deka of Tas­ma­nia’s Parks and Wildlife Ser­vice said at a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists do not know why</p>
    <p>whales, which travel to­gether in pods, some­times beach them­selves but they are known to fol­low a leader, as well as gather around an in­jured or dis­tressed whale.</p>
    <p>Wildlife bi­ol­o­gist Kris Car­lyon of the state gov­ern­ment con­ser­va­tion agency said: “We’re dealing with large, dis­tressed an­i­mals, and it does take an emo­tional toll. This is a nat­u­ral event so we can ac­cept that we’re go­ing to lose some an­i­mals. We’re fo­cus­ing on hav­ing as many sur­vivors as we can.”</p>
