    <p>You’d be for­given for think­ing of cryp­tocur­rency when you hear the word blockchain.</p>
    <p>Orig­i­nally built in 2008 to un­der­pin cryp­tocur­rency ex­changes, blockchain has now evolved into one of the world’s fastest-grow­ing tech­nolo­gies with the po­ten­tial to re­shape our econ­omy and so­ci­ety in ways not seen since the ad­vent of the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is a front run­ner in the race to ex­plore, de­velop and com­mer­cialise blockchain tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Through in­dus­try ini­tia­tives, the coun­try has been ad­vanc­ing the un­der­stand­ing of how dis­trib­uted ledger tech­nol­ogy (DLT) – which lies at the heart of ev­ery blockchain – can be used com­mer­cially.</p>
    <p>So with com­pa­nies, fin­techs, fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions and reg­u­la­tors hav­ing come to­gether – vir­tu­ally – last month at the Sin­ga­pore Blockchain Week, per­haps now is a good time to take a step back and ask: What can blockchain ac­tu­ally do for a Sin­ga­pore busi­ness and is it too good to be true?</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 en­vi­ron­ment has seen busi­nesses tran­si­tion to near to­tal digital op­er­a­tions. Many firms are fast get­ting to grips with new tech­nolo­gies. So where does blockchain fit in?</p>
    <p>MORE THAN BIT­COIN</p>
    <p>Let’s start from the top: What ex­actly is blockchain?</p>
    <p>Blockchain is a sys­tem of record­ing in­for­ma­tion in a way that makes it dif­fi­cult or im­pos­si­ble to change or hack the sys­tem, or im­mutable data.</p>
    <p>The best way to un­der­stand a blockchain is to imag­ine a mas­sive, vir­tual spread­sheet, du­pli­cated across mul­ti­ple com­put­ers, or nodes, which are all con­nected to one an­other form­ing a chain. When you add to the spread­sheet, each copy on the chain gets up­dated with a time­stamp, mak­ing it al­most im­pos­si­ble to tam­per with.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the most well-known use of blockchain is cryp­tocur­ren­cies like bit­coin.</p>
    <p>How­ever, blockchain has much broader ap­pli­ca­tions and the ben­e­fits for small busi­nesses ex­tend far be­yond pro­vid­ing se­cure pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Blockchain is cre­at­ing new op­por­tu­ni­ties for busi­nesses in ev­ery sec­tor to solve ex­ist­ing pain points and de­velop new op­er­at­ing mod­els.</p>
    <p>CASH FLOW MAN­AGE­MENT</p>
    <p>One of the big­gest universal chal­lenges plagu­ing busi­nesses – par­tic­u­larly over re­cent months – is cash flow.</p>
    <p>In­deed a re­cent sur­vey by HSBC re­vealed that Sin­ga­pore busi­nesses iden­ti­fied the chal­lenge of main­tain­ing suf­fi­cient cash flow as the big­gest hur­dle to their re­silience in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>In the wake of Covid-19, 71 per cent of busi­nesses in Sin­ga­pore are plan­ning to in­crease their work­ing cap­i­tal, their cash flows or both; much higher than their global peers at 64 per cent.</p>
    <p>So how can blockchain help with cash flow chal­lenges?</p>
    <p>One way is through the use of smart con­tracts. Such con­tracts not only au­to­mate agree­ments but also en­force con­tracts be­tween cus­tomers and sup­pli­ers.</p>
    <p>Think of a smart con­tract as a self-ex­e­cuted, coded agree­ment that de­liv­ers guar­an­teed out­comes if cer­tain pre­con­di­tions are met.</p>
    <p>This has the po­ten­tial to make life eas­ier for busi­nesses by re­mov­ing pa­per­work, cre­at­ing fric­tion­less trans­ac­tion pro­cesses, and al­low­ing in­voice pay­ments to be made swiftly, without the need to chase for pay­ment.</p>
    <p>DECENTRALI­SATION AND SE­CU­RITY</p>
    <p>An­other ad­van­tage of blockchain is the se­cu­rity ben­e­fits it pro­vides.</p>
    <p>Blockchain ap­pli­ca­tions are in­her­ently de­cen­tralised, mean­ing that data is dis­trib­uted to dif­fer­ent com­put­ers around the world in par­al­lel and si­mul­ta­ne­ously.</p>
    <p>Trans­ac­tions can­not be ma­nip­u­lated or deleted through a cy­ber­hack be­cause each trans­ac­tion is linked to the one that pre­ceded it.</p>
    <p>SUP­PLY CHAIN MAN­AGE­MENT</p>
    <p>Our lat­est sur­vey shows that, hav­ing been more acutely im­pacted by Covid-19, Sin­ga­pore firms are now pri­ori­tis­ing their sup­ply chains as a way to en­sure sus­tain­able op­er­a­tions for the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>In fact, Sin­ga­pore busi­nesses are more in­tent on se­cur­ing their sup­ply chains than their global coun­ter­parts. Sig­nif­i­cantly, they are also plac­ing a heav­ier em­pha­sis on in­te­grat­ing tech­nol­ogy into their sup­ply chain man­age­ment, with 36 per cent of firms say­ing they will fo­cus on digi­tis­ing their sup­ply chains in the next one or two years.</p>
    <p>Blockchain also has the po­ten­tial to help busi­nesses build smarter and more se­cure sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>Most prod­ucts are not made by one sin­gle com­pany, so a blockchain-backed sup­ply chain means that each trans­ac­tion from point of ori­gin to point of sale can be tracked through a trans­par­ent and trace­able au­dit trail with real-time vis­i­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>TRADE FI­NANC­ING</p>
    <p>Blockchain, in this in­stance, holds the prom­ise of im­proved pro­cess­ing speed, en­hanced se­cu­rity and bet­ter in­ven­tory man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>HSBC has been work­ing with Con­tour, the Sin­ga­pore-based open trade fi­nance blockchain net­work, to make trade fi­nance sim­pler, bet­ter and faster. An area of fo­cus is the pa­per-in­ten­sive process of is­su­ing let­ters of credit (LC).</p>
    <p>Our work to ex­plore blockchain in trade fi­nance has de­vel­oped in re­cent years, hav­ing ex­e­cuted the world’s first live blockchain LC trans­ac­tion in Sin­ga­pore with Cargill in 2018.</p>
    <p>HSBC has since com­pleted 14 trans­ac­tions for busi­nesses of vary­ing sizes in­volv­ing over</p>
    <p>US$30 mil­lion (S$41 mil­lion) worth of goods. The next mile­stone is to do reg­u­lar trans­ac­tions across var­i­ous in­dus­tries and clients to take blockchain in trade fi­nance to the next level.</p>
    <p>NOT IF, BUT WHEN</p>
    <p>Blockchain has the po­ten­tial to ad­dress a num­ber of busi­nesses’ pain points in­clud­ing pay­ments and col­lec­tions, sup­ply chain in­ef­fi­cien­cies, cy­ber­crime and in­for­ma­tion trans­parency.</p>
    <p>How­ever, while blockchain and its po­ten­tial ben­e­fits are well pub­li­cised, its ap­pli­ca­tions and lim­i­ta­tions are only just be­com­ing clear.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses should be en­gag­ing with in­dus­try ex­perts and reg­u­la­tors to un­der­stand whether blockchain is truly the an­swer to their prob­lems.</p>
    <p>There are a cou­ple of things that busi­nesses should do to get crack­ing with blockchain. First, iden­tify the prob­lem you’re try­ing to fix, be it cre­at­ing ef­fi­cien­cies or en­sur­ing se­cu­rity of data.</p>
    <p>Like any new so­lu­tion, its ap­pli­ca­tion will be in vain if you don’t know what you are try­ing to achieve.</p>
    <p>Ex­plor­ing and un­der­stand­ing the dif­fer­ent blockchain plat­forms in the mar­ket is key.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that you need a peer net­work to use blockchain. For in­stance, in a sup­ply chain, each com­po­nent sup­plier of a par­tic­u­lar prod­uct needs to be on the chain for the com­pany that as­sem­bles and mar­kets the fi­nal prod­uct.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses should also think about ac­cess to blockchain plat­forms, as the up­front costs can be high.</p>
    <p>The fu­ture for blockchain is be­com­ing clearer as tri­als move into in­vest­ments and com­mer­cial­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>We see cer­tain plat­forms suc­ceed­ing to drive new value as smaller lo­cal or re­gional net­works, such as we.trade in Europe. Or, with sin­gle-mar­ket fo­cused so­lu­tions, for in­stance, our work with Te­masek and the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change on ex­plor­ing the use of blockchain and DLT for bond is­suance.</p>
    <p>Blockchain is at a tip­ping point. For those will­ing to ac­cept decentrali­sation as the fu­ture di­rec­tion, it could solve many chal­lenges that busi­nesses ex­pe­ri­ence daily.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal busi­nesses would be wise to pre­pare them­selves for the tech­nol­ogy and its ap­pli­ca­tions to hit their doorsteps.</p>
