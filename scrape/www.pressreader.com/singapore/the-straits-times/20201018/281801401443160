    <p>WELLING­TON A fresh-faced Ms Jacinda Ardern en­tered of­fice three years ago promis­ing “re­lent­less pos­i­tiv­ity” – and New Zealand’s leader has needed it in abun­dance as a suc­ces­sion of catas­tro­phes be­sieged the na­tion and tested her met­tle.</p>
    <p>In a hec­tic first term, Ms Ardern has faced New Zealand’s worst ter­ror at­tack, a deadly vol­canic erup­tion, the coun­try’s deep­est re­ces­sion in more than 30 years and the shared global threat of a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Along the way, she also had a baby and be­came the in­ter­na­tional stan­dard bearer for pro­gres­sive pol­i­tics in an era of right-wing pop­ulist strong­men. She is only the sec­ond leader – af­ter former Pak­istani prime min­is­ter Be­nazir Bhutto – to give birth while in of­fice.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern had been in of­fice barely 18 months when a white su­prem­a­cist gun­man opened fire in two Christchur­ch mosques dur­ing Fri­day prayers, killing 51 Mus­lim wor­ship­pers and wound­ing 40 on March 15 last year. Her com­pas­sion­ate re­sponse to the ram­page of hate de­fined the charis­matic cen­tre-left leader’s im­age around the world.</p>
    <p>When she donned a head­scarf and com­forted vic­tims’ fam­i­lies af­ter the shoot­ing, it res­onated glob­ally. She would later de­scribe it as a spon­ta­neous ges­ture of re­spect to the Mus­lim com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>She has also won plau­dits for de­ci­sive pol­icy ac­tion, in­clud­ing swiftly en­acted gun law re­forms and a push to force so­cial me­dia giants to ad­dress on­line hate speech.</p>
    <p>The New Zealand pub­lic used yes­ter­day’s gen­eral elec­tion to em­phat­i­cally back the 40-year-old’s per­for­mance, giv­ing her a sec­ond three­year term in of­fice.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern’s cam­paign pitch fo­cused heav­ily on her govern­ment’s suc­cess in con­tain­ing the coro­n­avirus, with New Zealand record­ing only 25 deaths in a pop­u­la­tion of five mil­lion peo­ple. She ar­gued that only her cen­tre-left Labour Party could be trusted to keep New Zealan­ders safe.</p>
    <p>“This has been a re­ally tough time for New Zealand – we’ve had a ter­ror­ist at­tack, a nat­u­ral dis­as­ter and a global pan­demic,” she said. “But in these tough times we’ve seen the best of us. We’ve been able to clear high hur­dles and face huge chal­lenges be­cause of who we are, and be­cause we had a plan.”</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern grew up in the North Is­land hin­ter­land, where her father was a po­lice of­fi­cer. She cred­its the poverty she saw there with shap­ing her be­liefs. She was raised as a Mor­mon but left the faith in her 20s due to its stance against ho­mo­sex­u­al­ity.</p>
    <p>Af­ter com­plet­ing a com­mu­ni­ca­tions de­gree, she be­gan her po­lit­i­cal ca­reer in former prime min­is­ter He­len Clark’s of­fice be­fore work­ing in Bri­tain as a pol­icy ad­viser in Mr Tony Blair’s govern­ment.</p>
    <p>She was elected to Par­lia­ment in 2008, and, in March 2017 be­came Labour’s deputy leader, say­ing at the time that she was not am­bi­tious and saw her­self as a back­room staff mem­ber.</p>
