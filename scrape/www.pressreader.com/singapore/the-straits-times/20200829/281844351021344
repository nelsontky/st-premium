    <p>• The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) will next week re­ceive a raft of pledges of sup­port for its plan for Covid-19 vac­cines for all.</p>
    <p>But the agency has al­ready had to scale back its am­bi­tion.</p>
    <p>The United States, Ja­pan, Bri­tain and the Euro­pean Union have struck their own deals to se­cure mil­lions of Covid-19 vac­cine doses for their cit­i­zens, ig­nor­ing the United Na­tions body’s warn­ings that “vac­cine na­tion­al­ism” will squeeze sup­plies.</p>
    <p>If other coun­tries that can af­ford it pur­sue a sim­i­lar ap­proach, the WHO’s strat­egy for fight­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic glob­ally and eq­ui­tably risks com­ing un­done, ex­perts warn.</p>
    <p>“If that were to hap­pen, it’s fairly clear that there would be in­suf­fi­cient vol­umes of vac­cine avail­able for any other coun­tries, par­tic­u­larly in the first six to nine months,” said Well­come Trust’s head of global pol­icy Alex Har­ris.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries wish­ing to be part of the WHO ini­tia­tive, dubbed Co­vax, must sub­mit ex­pres­sions of in­ter­est by next Mon­day.</p>
    <p>More than 170 coun­tries, in­clud­ing Canada, Nor­way, South Korea and Bri­tain, have sub­mit­ted non­bind­ing ex­pres­sions of in­ter­est to par­tic­i­pate in the scheme, which the WHO has touted as the only global ini­tia­tive to en­sure Covid-19 vac­cines are avail­able world­wide to rich and poor coun­tries alike.</p>
    <p>It has signed up nine Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­dates and set out plans to ob­tain and de­liver two bil­lion doses by the end of next year across coun­tries that sign up.</p>
    <p>But it has strug­gled to get wealth­ier coun­tries on board in full, be­yond pledges of fund­ing and warm words about donat­ing sur­plus vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Last week, WHO chief Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus crit­i­cised na­tions that hoard vac­cines, warn­ing that the strat­egy will worsen the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In a last-ditch call for sup­port ahead of Mon­day’s dead­line, he wrote let­ters to mem­bers urg­ing their par­tic­i­pa­tion.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Com­mis­sion is “fully com­mit­ted” to the suc­cess of Co­vax while it en­ters into par­al­lel talks with vac­cine man­u­fac­tur­ers for sup­plies for the bloc, a spokesman told Reuters.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain said it was supporting Co­vax to en­sure equal ac­cess to vac­cines, in­clud­ing fund­ing, while do­ing its own bi­lat­eral sup­ply deals.</p>
    <p>The White House did not im­me­di­ately comment on the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The US did not par­tic­i­pate in the launch of the pro­gramme in April or a fund-rais­ing event in May.</p>
    <p>The EU’s ag­gres­sive deal-mak­ing for vac­cine sup­plies and tepid state­ments about Co­vax have in par­tic­u­lar un­der­mined the ini­tia­tive, which is co-led by the WHO, the Gavi vac­cine al­liance and the Coali­tion for Epi­demic Pre­pared­ness In­no­va­tions (Cepi).</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Com­mis­sion is likely to pledge cash for Co­vax, but it is also se­cur­ing its own sup­ply deals for mem­ber states, deem­ing Co­vax too slow and ex­pen­sive.</p>
    <p>Brus­sels has told coun­tries they can help fund Co­vax, but can­not seek to buy vac­cines via both schemes.</p>
    <p>Forced to choose, some coun­tries have pulled out of Co­vax en­tirely. The Czech Repub­lic and Por­tu­gal were listed as early back­ers, but gov­ern­ment sup­port ap­pears to have cooled af­ter join­ing the EU vac­cine pro­cure­ment pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Prague has opted for the EU pro­gramme in­stead.</p>
    <p>Por­tu­gal has asked for an ini­tial de­liv­ery of 6.9 mil­lion doses of vac­cine when the EU pro­gramme be­comes avail­able.</p>
    <p>Asked if it would take part in Co­vax, a spokesman for the coun­try’s drug reg­u­la­tor In­farmed said it would co­or­di­nate its par­tic­i­pa­tion in the pro­gramme with other Euro­pean na­tions.</p>
    <p>Other WHO mem­bers, which are al­ready ma­jor donors to ex­ist­ing global vac­cine pro­grammes un­re­lated to Covid-19, are on the fence.</p>
    <p>Brazil, with the world’s sec­ond­worst coro­n­avirus out­break out­side the US, has not yet de­cided to par­tic­i­pate, a Health Min­istry spokesman said.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials say both Co­vax and gov­ern­ment deals can run in par­al­lel, but that is a rad­i­cal de­par­ture from the orig­i­nal plan.</p>
    <p>In act­ing alone, coun­tries will cre­ate “a few win­ners and many losers”, Cepi chief ex­ec­u­tive Richard Hatch­ett warned on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>It also means poorer or less pow­er­ful coun­tries may go to the back of the queue for vac­cines that could help them con­trol the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Dim­itri Eynikel, EU rep­re­sen­ta­tive on medicines and vac­cines for Doc­tors With­out Bor­ders, said: “The risk is that ac­cess to Covid-19 vac­cines will be de­fined by pur­chas­ing power and the abil­ity to sign ad­vance pur­chase deals, rather than the med­i­cal needs or the shift­ing epi­demi­o­log­i­cal sit­u­a­tions.”</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive is all the more sig­nif­i­cant for the WHO as scru­tiny grows on its han­dling of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The re­sults of the first round will high­light the chal­lenge of tack­ling a global cri­sis with competing in­di­vid­ual in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>One se­nior Euro­pean gov­ern­ment of­fi­cial ex­plained the dilemma fac­ing wealthy na­tions: How to sup­port a vac­cine for de­vel­op­ing na­tions when there may not be enough for your own pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Di­vert­ing re­sources abroad “is dif­fi­cult to sell at home”, he said.</p>
    <p>In act­ing alone, coun­tries will cre­ate “a few win­ners and many losers”, Cepi chief ex­ec­u­tive Richard Hatch­ett warned on Mon­day. It also means poorer or less pow­er­ful coun­tries may go to the back of the queue for vac­cines that could help them con­trol the pan­demic.</p>
