    <p>A 13-year-old boy and a 10-year-old girl are the two new Covid-19 cases in the com­mu­nity re­ported by the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Both pa­tients had last been at their re­spec­tive schools on Oct 2. They were both quar­an­tined from Oct 3, and were swabbed on that day but tested neg­a­tive, MOH said in a state­ment last night.</p>
    <p>Both later de­vel­oped symptoms dur­ing quar­an­tine and sub­se­quently tested pos­i­tive on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>There were no new lo­cal cases from work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries yes­ter­day, said the min­istry. This was the sec­ond day in a row that no new cases from dor­mi­to­ries were re­ported.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day morn­ing, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong cau­tioned against com­pla­cency and said that Sin­ga­pore will likely see new cases.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post, Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling Covid-19, ac­knowl­edged the fa­tigue that has set in for the cur­rent mea­sures, but re­it­er­ated that “the virus had not been erad­i­cated”, adding that “it’s still cir­cu­lat­ing in our com­mu­nity”.</p>
    <p>“We still need to keep our guard up and stay very dis­ci­plined in com­ply­ing with all the nec­es­sary safe­guards. That’s the mind­set that will en­able us to con­tinue on this path of pro­gres­sive reopening in a safe and sus­tain­able man­ner,” he said.</p>
    <p>Im­ported cases made up the re­main­ing three of the five new cases an­nounced yes­ter­day. They were a Sin­ga­porean re­turn­ing from the United King­dom, a short-term visit pass holder re­turn­ing from Rus­sia and a stu­dent’s pass holder re­turn­ing from In­dia.</p>
    <p>All the im­ported cases were placed on stay-home no­tices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore. They were tested pos­i­tive while serv­ing their no­tices at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Hi Five, an In­dian-Muslim food out­let in the Ro­chor area, was the sole new lo­ca­tion added yes­ter­day to a list of places vis­ited by in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>MOH pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions that such pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes and the times they vis­ited to get peo­ple who were at those places to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on the gov.sg web­site.</p>
    <p>The min­istry has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and that there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from one case a day two weeks ago to fewer than one a day in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has also de­creased from a daily av­er­age of fewer than one case a day to none in same pe­riod.</p>

While the av&#xAD;er&#xAD;age num&#xAD;ber of new daily cases in the com&#xAD;mu&#xAD;nity in a week has fallen to fewer than one a day in the past week, Ed&#xAD;u&#xAD;ca&#xAD;tion Min&#xAD;is&#xAD;ter Lawrence Wong re&#xAD;it&#xAD;er&#xAD;ated the need to still keep one&#x2019;s guard up.</p>
