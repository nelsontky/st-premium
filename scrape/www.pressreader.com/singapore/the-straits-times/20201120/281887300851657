    <p>GAZA • For Ms Naela Abu Jibba, a mother of five who lives and works in the Gaza Strip, tak­ing the road less trav­elled has be­come a way of life.</p>
    <p>As the first woman taxi driver in the Is­lamist-run Pales­tinian ter­ri­tory, the 39-year-old has be­come a tar­get of sex­ist jibes about her abil­i­ties be­hind the wheel – but they pale into ir­rel­e­vance be­side the grat­i­tude of her all-fe­male clien­tele.</p>
    <p>“I get lots of of­fen­sive (social media) com­ments, but the en­cour­ag­ing com­ments are far greater,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Some say this is a job for men, oth­ers say we (women) cause ac­ci­dents, when the fact is women are calmer and more care­ful drivers than men.”</p>
    <p>Many of her pas­sen­gers, who must book her service in ad­vance, feel calmer too, be­ing driven by her than by men. “When a woman ex­its a hair­dresser shop, going to a party dressed and wear­ing makeup, she feels bet­ter rid­ing with a woman,” Ms Abu Jibba said.</p>
    <p>Many of her pas­sen­gers, who must book her service in ad­vance, feel calmer too, be­ing driven by her than by men.</p>
    <p>Client Sou­san Abu Ateila, 28, agreed. “We feel more com­fort­able,” she told Reuters.</p>
    <p>Ms Abu Jibba, who has a de­gree in com­mu­nity service, started her taxi busi­ness af­ter fail­ing to find work. Gaza’s un­em­ploy­ment rate stands at 49 per cent, with hard­ship deep­ened by bor­der re­stric­tions that Is­rael and Egypt, cit­ing se­cu­rity concerns, have long main­tained.</p>
    <p>Wear­ing a head­scarf and a face mask, Ms Abu Jibba drives an off</p>
    <p>white Kia and wears a vest with her Al-Mukhtara (Chief­tain) taxi service’s liv­ery.</p>
    <p>Ms Abu Jibba hopes to ex­pand her busi­ness once the pandemic – which has caused Gaza res­i­dents to cut down on their travel and social ac­tiv­i­ties – ends.</p>
    <p>The ter­ri­tory of two mil­lion peo­ple has re­ported more than 12,000 cases and 56 deaths.</p>
    <p>“My dream is to have an AlMukhtara fleet,” Ms Abu Jibba said.</p>
