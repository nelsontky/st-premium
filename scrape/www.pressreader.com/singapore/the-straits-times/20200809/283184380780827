    <p>Within the last cou­ple of months, sev­eral sci­en­tific stud­ies have come out – some peer-re­viewed, oth­ers not – in­di­cat­ing that the an­ti­body re­sponse of peo­ple in­fected with Sars-CoV-2 dropped sig­nif­i­cantly within two months. The news has sparked fears that the very im­mu­nity of pa­tients with Covid-19 may be wan­ing fast – damp­en­ing hopes for the devel­op­ment of an ef­fec­tive and durable vac­cine.</p>
    <p>But these con­cerns are con­fused and mis­taken.</p>
    <p>Both our bod­ies’ nat­u­ral im­mu­nity and im­mu­nity ac­quired through vac­ci­na­tion serve the same func­tion, which is to in­hibit a virus and pre­vent it from caus­ing a dis­ease. But they don’t al­ways work quite the same way. So, a find­ing that nat­u­rally oc­cur­ring an­ti­bod­ies in some Covid-19 pa­tients are fad­ing doesn’t ac­tu­ally mean very much for the likely ef­fi­cacy of vac­cines un­der devel­op­ment. Sci­ence, in this case, can be more ef­fec­tive than na­ture.</p>
    <p>The hu­man im­mune sys­tem has evolved to serve two func­tions: ex­pe­di­ency and pre­ci­sion. Hence, we have two types of im­mu­nity: in­nate im­mu­nity, which jumps into ac­tion within hours, some­times just min­utes, of an in­fec­tion; and adap­tive im­mu­nity, which de­vel­ops over days and weeks.</p>
    <p>Al­most all the cells in the hu­man body can de­tect a vi­ral in­fec­tion, and when they do, they call on our white blood cells to de­ploy a de­fen­sive re­sponse against the in­fec­tious agent.</p>
    <p>When our in­nate im­mune re­sponse is suc­cess­ful at con­tain­ing that pathogen, the in­fec­tion is re­solved quickly and, gen­er­ally, with­out many symp­toms. In the case of more sus­tained in­fec­tions, it’s our adap­tive im­mune sys­tem that kicks in to of­fer us pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>The adap­tive im­mune sys­tem con­sists of two types of white blood cells, called T and B cells, that de­tect molec­u­lar de­tails spe­cific to the virus and, based on that, mount a tar­geted re­sponse to it.</p>
    <p>A virus causes dis­ease by en­ter­ing cells in the hu­man body and hi­jack­ing their ge­netic ma­chin­ery so as to re­pro­duce it­self again and again: It turns its hosts into vi­ral fac­to­ries.</p>
    <p>T cells de­tect and kill those in­fected cells. B cells make an­ti­bod­ies, a kind of pro­tein that binds to the vi­ral par­ti­cles and blocks them from en­ter­ing our cells; this pre­vents the repli­ca­tion of the virus and stops the in­fec­tion in its tracks.</p>
    <p>The body then stores the T and B cells that helped elim­i­nate the in­fec­tion, in case it might need them in the fu­ture to fight off the same virus again. These so-called mem­ory cells are the main agents of long-term im­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>The an­ti­bod­ies pro­duced in re­sponse to a com­mon sea­sonal coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion last for about a year. But the an­ti­bod­ies gen­er­ated by a measles in­fec­tion last, and pro­vide pro­tec­tion, for a life­time.</p>
    <p>Yet it is also the case that with other viruses the amount of an­ti­bod­ies in the blood peaks dur­ing an in­fec­tion and drops af­ter the in­fec­tion has cleared, of­ten within a few months: This is the fact that has some peo­ple wor­ried about Covid-19, but it doesn’t mean what it might seem.</p>
    <p>That an­ti­bod­ies de­crease once an in­fec­tion re­cedes isn’t a sign that they are fail­ing: it’s a nor­mal step in the usual course of an im­mune re­sponse. Nor does a wan­ing an­ti­body count mean wan­ing im­mu­nity: The mem­ory B cells that first pro­duced those an­ti­bod­ies are still around, and stand­ing ready to churn out new batches of an­ti­bod­ies on de­mand.</p>
    <p>And that is why we should be hope­ful about the prospects of a vac­cine for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>A vac­cine works by mim­ick­ing a nat­u­ral in­fec­tion, gen­er­at­ing mem­ory T and B cells that can then pro­vide long-last­ing pro­tec­tion in the peo­ple who are vac­ci­nated. Yet the im­mu­nity cre­ated by vac­cines dif­fers from the im­mu­nity cre­ated by a nat­u­ral in­fec­tion in sev­eral im­por­tant ways.</p>
    <p>Vir­tu­ally all viruses that in­fect hu­mans con­tain in their genomes blue­prints for pro­duc­ing pro­teins that help them evade de­tec­tion by the in­nate im­mune sys­tem. For ex­am­ple, Sars-CoV-2 ap­pears to have a gene ded­i­cated to si­lenc­ing the in­nate im­mune sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Among the viruses that have be­come en­demic in hu­mans, some have also fig­ured out ways to dodge the adap­tive im­mune sys­tem: HIV mu­tates rapidly, her­pes viruses de­ploy pro­teins that can trap and in­ca­pac­i­tate an­ti­bod­ies.</p>
    <p>Thank­fully, Sars-CoV-2 does not seem to have evolved any such tricks yet – sug­gest­ing that we still have an op­por­tu­nity to stem its spread and the pan­demic by pur­su­ing a rel­a­tively straight­for­ward vac­cine ap­proach.</p>
    <p>Vac­cines come in dif­fer­ent flavours – they can be based on killed or live at­ten­u­ated vi­ral ma­te­rial, nu­cleic acids or re­com­bi­nant pro­teins. But all vac­cines con­sist of two main com­po­nents: an anti­gen and an ad­ju­vant. The anti­gen is the part of the virus we want the adap­tive im­mune re­sponse to re­act to and tar­get. The ad­ju­vant is an agent that mim­ics the in­fec­tion and helps jump-start the im­mune re­sponse.</p>
    <p>One beauty of vac­cines – and one of their great ad­van­tages over our body’s nat­u­ral re­ac­tion to in­fec­tions – is that their anti­gens can be de­signed to fo­cus the im­mune re­sponse on a virus’ Achilles heel (what­ever that may be).</p>
    <p>An­other ad­van­tage is that vac­cines al­low for dif­fer­ent kinds and dif­fer­ent doses of ad­ju­vants – and so, for cal­i­bra­tion and fine-tun­ing that can help boost and lengthen im­mune re­sponses.</p>
    <p>The im­mune re­sponse gen­er­ated against a virus dur­ing nat­u­ral in­fec­tion is, to some de­gree, at the mercy of the virus it­self. Not so with vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Since many viruses evade the in­nate im­mune sys­tem, nat­u­ral in­fec­tions some­times do not re­sult in ro­bust or long-last­ing im­mu­nity. The hu­man pa­pil­lo­mavirus is one of them, which is why it can cause chronic in­fec­tions. The pa­pil­lo­mavirus vac­cine trig­gers a far bet­ter an­ti­body re­sponse to its vi­ral anti­gen than does a nat­u­ral HPV in­fec­tion: It is al­most 100 per cent ef­fec­tive in pre­vent­ing HPV in­fec­tion and dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Not only does vac­ci­na­tion pro­tect against in­fec­tion and dis­ease, it also blocks vi­ral trans­mis­sion – and, if suf­fi­ciently wide­spread, can help con­fer so-called herd im­mu­nity to a pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>What pro­por­tion of in­di­vid­u­als in a given pop­u­la­tion needs to be im­mune to a new virus so that the whole group is, in ef­fect, pro­tected depends on the virus’ ba­sic re­pro­duc­tion num­ber – broadly speak­ing, that is the aver­age num­ber of peo­ple that a sin­gle in­fected per­son will, in turn, in­fect.</p>
    <p>For measles, which is highly con­ta­gious, more than 90 per cent of a pop­u­la­tion must be im­mu­nised in or­der for un­vac­ci­nated in­di­vid­u­als to also be pro­tected.</p>
    <p>For Covid-19, the es­ti­mated fig­ure – which is un­set­tled, un­der­stand­ably – ranges be­tween 43 per cent and 66 per cent.</p>
    <p>Given the se­vere con­se­quences of Covid-19 for many older pa­tients, as well as the dis­ease’s un­pre­dictable course and con­se­quences for the young, the only safe way to achieve herd im­mu­nity is through vac­ci­na­tion. That, com­bined with the fact that Sars-CoV-2 ap­pears not to have yet de­vel­oped a mech­a­nism to evade de­tec­tion by our adap­tive im­mune sys­tem, is am­ple rea­son to dou­ble down on ef­forts to find a vac­cine fast.</p>
    <p>So do not be alarmed by re­ports about Covid-19 pa­tients’ drop­ping an­ti­body counts; those are ir­rel­e­vant to the prospects of find­ing a vi­able vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Re­mem­ber in­stead that more than 165 vac­cine can­di­dates are al­ready in the pipe­line, with some show­ing promis­ing early trial re­sults.</p>
    <p>And start think­ing about how best to en­sure that when that vac­cine comes, it will be dis­trib­uted ef­fi­ciently and eq­ui­tably. of im­muno­bi­ol­ogy and a pro­fes­sor in the depart­ment of molec­u­lar, cel­lu­lar and de­vel­op­men­tal bi­ol­ogy at Yale. Rus­lan Medzhi­tov is a Ster­ling pro­fes­sor in the depart­ment of im­muno­bi­ol­ogy at Yale School of Medicine. Both are in­ves­ti­ga­tors at the Howard Hughes Med­i­cal In­sti­tute.</p>
