    <p>HONG KONG • China Ever­grande Group said its debt-cut­ting mea­sures were work­ing and the Hong Kong bourse had ap­proved its spin-off plan, send­ing the prop­erty de­vel­oper’s shares up yes­ter­day af­ter a sell-off last week.</p>
    <p>Shares climbed 21 per cent at the close in Hong Kong, eras­ing last week’s tum­ble.</p>
    <p>A volatile ses­sion for Ever­grande’s dol­lar bonds saw its note due next year end the day up 3.9 cents on the dol­lar at 90.4 cents, ac­cord­ing to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The com­pany’s on­shore bonds due 2024 rose 14.4 per cent to 75.3 yuan.</p>
    <p>In­vestors had dumped China Ever­grande’s shares and bonds last Fri­day af­ter a leaked doc­u­ment – later dis­missed by the com­pany as a fab­ri­ca­tion – sug­gested the na­tion’s sec­ond-big­gest prop­erty de­vel­oper by sales had sought gov­ern­ment help to avert a cash crunch.</p>
    <p>The com­pany said to­tal in­debt­ed­ness had fallen by 53.4 bil­lion yuan (S$10.8 bil­lion) over the six months to last Thurs­day when the doc­u­ment ap­peared on­line, while fi­nanc­ing costs had dropped 2.24 per cent and it had pre­paid 43.5 bil­lion yuan of loans due af­ter last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Ever­grande’s bor­row­ings to­talled 835.5 bil­lion yuan at endJune, of which on­shore trust loans and bank lend­ing made up 41 per cent and 29 per cent re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Com­pany chair­man Hui Ka Yan said in a state­ment: “In the 24 years since the es­tab­lish­ment of the com­pany, the com­pany has bor­rowed loans across 20,523 trans­ac­tions. There has never been any late pay­ment of in­ter­est nor over­due re­pay­ment of prin­ci­pal.”</p>
    <p>The de­vel­oper is un­der pres­sure to slash debt as Bei­jing tack­les what it con­sid­ers ex­ces­sive bor­row­ing in the real es­tate devel­op­ment sec­tor with new debt ra­tio caps.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong-listed stock had fallen over 25 per cent this year on con­cern over com­pe­ti­tion as the pan­demic keeps of­fices shut and buyers at home.</p>
    <p>Ever­grande said ag­gre­gated con­tracted sales amounted to 504.9 bil­lion yuan as at last Thurs­day, up 11.4 per cent from the same pe­riod a year ago, and cash on hand was 204.6 bil­lion yuan as at June 30.</p>
    <p>It said it aimed to achieve 200 bil­lion yuan con­tracted sales in this month and the next through na­tion­wide sales pro­mo­tions launched ear­lier in the month.</p>
    <p>The com­pany also said the Hong Kong stock ex­change had ap­proved its plan to spin off its prop­erty man­age­ment busi­ness, pro­vid­ing the firm a chan­nel to raise funds.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed float is ex­pected to raise about US$2 bil­lion (S$2.8 bil­lion), ac­cord­ing to Reuters’ In­ter­na­tional Fi­nanc­ing Re­view.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther cap­i­tal could come from the pro­posed ini­tial public of­fer­ing and list­ing on Shang­hai’s Sci-Tech Board of its unit China Ever­grande New En­ergy Ve­hi­cle Group.</p>
    <p>In­vestors across Asia are watch­ing Ever­grande closely af­ter losses in the com­pany’s off­shore notes spread to high-yield debt around the re­gion last week.</p>
    <p>The de­vel­oper is not only Asia’s big­gest junk bond is­suer, but it is also one of the most sys­tem­i­cally im­por­tant firms in China, with 293 mil­lion sq m of land re­serves and projects in 237 cities as at the end of last year.</p>
    <p>The big­gest near-term worry sur­round­ing Ever­grande re­lates to an agree­ment the com­pany struck with some of its largest in­vestors. It gives them the right to de­mand their money back if the com­pany fails to win reg­u­la­tory ap­proval for a back­door list­ing on the Shen­zhen stock ex­change by Jan 31.</p>
    <p>The re­pay­ment could amount to 130 bil­lion yuan, and at least one of the in­vestors has sig­nalled it would be un­will­ing to ex­tend the dead­line.</p>
    <p>Ever­grande has said it will not raise new funds through the list­ing, but the trans­ac­tion could al­low it to achieve a higher val­u­a­tion and thus eas­ier ac­cess to fu­ture fi­nanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese reg­u­la­tors have yet to com­ment pub­licly on Ever­grande’s lat­est trou­bles, but the gov­ern­ment could play a de­ci­sive role in its fu­ture. Some an­a­lysts have spec­u­lated that the firm has failed to get a green light for its list­ing plan be­cause pol­i­cy­mak­ers are try­ing to tame sky-high home prices and re­strain fund rais­ing by de­vel­op­ers.</p>
    <p>Whether the au­thor­i­ties will al­low Ever­grande to run into se­ri­ous fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties is now one of the key ques­tions fac­ing cred­i­tors, share­hold­ers and cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>In­vestors had dumped China Ever­grande’s shares and bonds last Fri­day af­ter a leaked doc­u­ment – later dis­missed by the com­pany as a fab­ri­ca­tion – sug­gested the na­tion’s sec­ond-big­gest prop­erty de­vel­oper by sales had sought gov­ern­ment help to avert a cash crunch.</p>
