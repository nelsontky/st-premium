    <p>As Sin­ga­pore heads into the fi­nal stretch of test­ing and clear­ing all mi­grant work­ers in dor­mi­to­ries of the coro­n­avirus by the mid­dle of next month, the num­ber of daily in­fec­tions among this group can be ex­pected to rise, Min­is­ter for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Lawrence Wong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Even af­ter all of the work­ers are cleared of the virus, Mr Wong, who is co-chair of a multi-min­istry task force tack­ling the out­break, cau­tioned that pos­i­tive cases can still be ex­pected, and reg­u­lar test­ing will need to be done.</p>
    <p>This is sim­i­lar to the case for work per­mit hold­ers in the com­mu­nity, such as those liv­ing in pri­vate res­i­dences or Hous­ing Board flats, where pos­i­tive cases have con­tin­ued to be picked up, de­spite some of them serv­ing a 28-day iso­la­tion pe­riod.</p>
    <p>He was re­spond­ing to a ques­tion dur­ing a vir­tual press con­fer­ence on why there have con­sis­tently been pos­i­tive cases among work pass hold­ers in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>As of Thurs­day, around 232,000 work­ers have ei­ther re­cov­ered or been tested to be free of the virus. There are about 323,000 work­ers stay­ing in dorms in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>About 94 per cent of the 47,453 con­firmed coro­n­avirus cases in Sin­ga­pore as of yes­ter­day are dorm res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said that for the fi­nal phase of test­ing, many of the work­ers come from dorms with higher preva­lence of coro­n­avirus cases. This is why there has been an in­crease in con­firmed cases from dorms in re­cent days.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pect this trend to con­tinue over the com­ing days. But the main point is we are com­plet­ing the clear­ance of all the work­ers in the dor­mi­to­ries quite soon,” he said, adding that this could be done by the mid­dle of Au­gust or pos­si­bly ear­lier.</p>
    <p>“So, we are do­ing ev­ery­thing we can to com­plete that work and to al­low the work­ers to re­sume work safely there­after.”</p>
    <p>He added that even af­ter all of them are cleared, pe­ri­odic, rou­tine test­ing will have to be done ev­ery fort­night.</p>
    <p>“And I would not be sur­prised at all that we will still pick up pos­i­tive cases, and many of them may well be older in­fec­tions, but it may very well hap­pen – just as we are see­ing this for work­ers in the com­mu­nity. I think the same sit­u­a­tion will arise later on for work­ers in the dorms.”</p>
    <p>For work­ers in the com­mu­nity, be­cause they are com­ing from a</p>
    <p>“high vi­ral load en­vi­ron­ment” in their dorms or work sites, there is still a chance of them be­ing in­fected even af­ter serv­ing an iso­la­tion pe­riod, said Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>“When we find pos­i­tive cases, we have to pull them aside. We do serol­ogy tests for some of them and we find that... many of them are older in­fec­tions. And that is in a way look­ing at the tail end of com­ing off a very high vi­ral load sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong, who is co-chair of the multi-min­istry task force, agreed that it is not go­ing to be the case that there will be no more in­fec­tions af­ter all the work­ers in the dorms are tested and cleared.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause there will still be trans­mis­sion in the com­mu­nity, which is hap­pen­ing even to­day in the lo­cal pop­u­la­tion. This is why cases of acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tions are be­ing picked up. “The num­bers are small, but they are on­go­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>“And there­fore there will al­ways be risk that you will trig­ger an­other se­ries of in­fec­tions, go­ing for­ward. So, even af­ter clear­ing all the mi­grant work­ers and the dorms, you will still be pick­ing up cases from time to time,” said Mr Gan, adding that these may be old or new in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>He called for vig­i­lance even af­ter all the work­ers are cleared of in­fec­tion un­til there is an ef­fec­tive vac­cine and the virus can be wiped out.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore that comes about, I think we have to learn to live with the virus in the com­mu­nity, and do what we can to re­duce the num­ber of in­fec­tions, to slow down the trans­mis­sion, so that we are able to con­tain and con­trol the sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wong added that clear­ing all the work­ers of in­fec­tions in dorms would be an im­por­tant mile­stone.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter the clus­ters in the dorms flared up, we have had to man­age, con­tain and con­trol the flare up, but now we are reach­ing the fi­nal stretch and are able to very soon com­plete the clear­ance... and eventually have these work­ers back at work.”</p>
    <p>PAN­DEMIC STILL ON­GO­ING</p>
    <p>I would not be sur­prised at all that we will still pick up pos­i­tive cases, and many of them may well be older in­fec­tions, but it may very well hap­pen – just as we are see­ing this for work­ers in the com­mu­nity. I think the same sit­u­a­tion will arise later on for work­ers in the dorms. ’’</p>
