    <p>Food Folks @ Lau Pa Sat, a 7,000 sq ft space which cham­pi­ons lo­cal re­tail­ers and food and bev­er­age (F&B) con­cepts, is breath­ing new life into the Cen­tral Business Dis­trict hawker cen­tre. Food Folks houses 10 F&B brands and a re­tail area with more than 800 food-re­lated items from over 120 brands.</p>
    <p>Food Folks @ Lau Pa Sat, a 7,000 sq ft space which cham­pi­ons lo­cal re­tail­ers and food and bev­er­age (F&B) con­cepts, is breath­ing new life into the pop­u­lar Cen­tral Business Dis­trict hawker cen­tre, which is un­der­go­ing ren­o­va­tion.</p>
    <p>Launched on Thurs­day by the FairPrice Group, Food Folks houses 10 F&B brands as well as a re­tail area with more than 800 food-re­lated items from over 120 brands.</p>
    <p>Ren­o­va­tions for Lau Pa Sat started in April and the rest of the food cen­tre will re­open next year.</p>
    <p>Din­ers can ex­pect a range of mod­ern-Sin­ga­porean dishes ex­clu­sive to Food Folks.</p>
    <p>These in­clude prawn soup ra­men at Chef Kang’s Prawn Noo­dle House, an off­shoot of one-Miche­lin-starred restau­rant Chef Kang’s; Ul­ti­mate Plant-based Combo Rice by Bib Gour­mand-rated Shi Hui Yuan; and S’tay The Night, which fea­tures jack­fruit satay, from grain bowl con­cept Smol.</p>
    <p>Creme & Cone’s first per­ma­nent gela­te­ria of­fers freshly made Waf­fle Cones and Waf­fle Lol­lies, as well as new gelato flavours such as Java Ba­nana Chips and on­deh on­deh.</p>
    <p>On the re­tail front, 70 per cent of the brands are home-grown, while 40 per cent are not com­monly found in ma­jor su­per­mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Some have ven­tured from their on­line plat­forms into a phys­i­cal space for the first time – like lo­cal com­pany Edens, which launched on­line in July and is known for its shi­itake mush­room snacks.</p>
    <p>It marks its launch at Food Folks with an ex­clu­sive mala shi­itake chips flavour, and more new flavours are in the pipe­line.</p>
    <p>Its co-founder Crys­tal Cheng, 26, says: “With our first off-line pres­ence at Food Folks, we hope to have bet­ter ac­cess and ex­po­sure to our cus­tomers and grow our business. As much as e-com­merce is com­mon in to­day’s econ­omy, as a new lo­cal brand, it is hard to gain on­line traf­fic with lit­tle brand aware­ness.</p>
    <p>“En­ter­ing the re­tail space is in­tim­i­dat­ing and there are big risks in­volved, es­pe­cially for start-ups like us. Be­ing at Food Folks will al­low us to grow our sup­ply ca­pac­ity and gain ex­pe­ri­ence in work­ing with dis­tri­bu­tion if we ever en­ter other re­tail out­lets in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Food Folks has also part­nered other Sin­ga­porean brands – Fossa Choco­late; The 1925 Brew­ing Co; and Ar­ti­san Bricks, which uses Lego bricks for its cre­ations – to launch ex­clu­sive co-branded foodrelate­d mer­chan­dise and edi­ble prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>And in line with the re­cently an­nounced Made With Pas­sion na­tional ini­tia­tive aimed at pro­mot­ing sup­port for lo­cal brands, 10 out of the 48 brands un­der that are fea­tured at Food Folks. These in­clude Gryphon Tea, Jan­ice Wong Sin­ga­pore, Ng Ah Sio Bak Kut Teh and Brass Lion Dis­tillery.</p>
    <p>As part of its mis­sion to sup­port the re­tail and F&B busi­nesses, Food Folks pro­vides year-long mar­ket­ing ef­forts and has waived the ini­tial set-up fees for them.</p>
    <p>Mr Seah Kian Peng, group chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of NTUC En­ter­prise and FairPrice Group, says: “We un­der­stand the con­cerns and chal­lenges faced by the food busi­nesses amid the Covid-19 pan­demic. To sup­port our lo­cal food brands dur­ing this time as well as to help them plan for their fu­ture business de­vel­op­ments, FairPrice Group will avail our var­i­ous sup­port ini­tia­tives and net­work for them to lever­age.</p>
    <p>“We want to cap­ture and rekin­dle the nos­tal­gia Lau Pa Sat has for many of us. But at the same time, we want to plan for the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“Our life­styles and palates are chang­ing. The key is to make sure the Lau Pa Sat of the fu­ture con­tin­ues to be vi­brant, ex­cit­ing and mem­o­rable.”</p>
    <p>Next month, Food Folks will hold a #GiftLo­cal Christ­mas cam­paign for peo­ple to buy food-re­lated gift packs to spread fes­tive cheer to those in need.</p>
