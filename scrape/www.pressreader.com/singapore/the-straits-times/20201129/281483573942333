    <p>The cur­rent wet weather in Sin­ga­pore could be ex­tended un­til next March due to a cli­mate phe­nom­e­non called La Nina. Ac­cord­ing to Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Ser­vice Sin­ga­pore, La Nina con­di­tions were de­tected this month.</p>
    <p>If they per­sist, they could bring rain even dur­ing the drier months of Fe­bru­ary and March.</p>
    <p>The an­nual rainy sea­son is here, but the wet­ter weather could be pro­longed un­til next March due to the cli­mate phe­nom­e­non known as La Nina.</p>
    <p>La Nina con­di­tions were de­tected this month, ac­cord­ing to the Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Ser­vice Sin­ga­pore (MSS), a unit un­der the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency.</p>
    <p>An MSS spokesman told The Sun­day Times: “It is likely that if the La Nina con­di­tions per­sist, Sin­ga­pore can ex­pect an in­creased chance of wet­ter con­di­tions in Fe­bru­ary and March.”</p>
    <p>The north-east mon­soon sea­son now un­der way has two phases.</p>
    <p>The wet phase be­tween De­cem­ber and Jan­uary usu­ally brings more rain while drier con­di­tions are preva­lent in Fe­bru­ary and March, but La Nina could bring rain even dur­ing th­ese months.</p>
    <p>La Nina is the “cry­baby” sis­ter to El Nino – the phe­nom­e­non usu­ally as­so­ci­ated with hot and dry weather in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Both are caused by changes in at­mo­spheric pres­sure and sea sur­face tem­per­a­tures in the trop­i­cal Pa­cific Ocean, and have op­po­site ef­fects on the weather over the mar­itime con­ti­nent, which in­cludes Sin­ga­pore and In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Un­der nor­mal con­di­tions, the western Pa­cific – where coun­tries like Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia and In­done­sia sit – is much warmer than the east due to trade winds blow­ing from the east.</p>
    <p>Th­ese trade winds nor­mally keep warm water con­fined around the mar­itime con­ti­nent.</p>
    <p>But dur­ing an El Nino, the trade winds weaken. This means the pool of warm water is no longer con­fined to the re­gion.</p>
    <p>As the warm water moves to­wards the cen­tral Pa­cific Ocean, the rain clouds fol­low.</p>
    <p>This is why South-east Asia ex­pe­ri­ences less rain and hot­ter weather dur­ing an El Nino event.</p>
    <p>But the op­po­site hap­pens in a La Nina event: Trade winds in­ten­sify, caus­ing warm water to be more tightly con­fined around the mar­itime con­ti­nent.</p>
    <p>This con­cen­trates the mois­ture sup­ply, which fu­els the for­ma­tion of rain clouds that bring more rain.</p>
    <p>MSS fig­ures show that be­tween Nov 1 and last Tues­day, Sin­ga­pore had about 290.5mm of rain­fall – higher than the long-term av­er­age for Novem­ber of 260.2mm.</p>
    <p>But the MSS spokesman said that while the pre­vail­ing La Nina con­di­tions may have an in­flu­ence on rain­fall, other sources of vari­abil­ity such as mon­soonal winds and lo­cal ef­fects play a more dom­i­nant role on a day-to-day ba­sis.</p>
    <p>“The La Nina is a rel­a­tively slowly vary­ing cli­mate phe­nom­e­non and it is dif­fi­cult to as­cer­tain its in­flu­ence over short pe­ri­ods,” he said.</p>
    <p>Na­tional water agency PUB said flash floods oc­curred on two days this month – Nov 2 and 7 – while there were none last Novem­ber, and two days in Novem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>PUB’s storm water man­age­ment ap­proach in­cludes slow­ing rain­wa­ter from en­ter­ing the public drainage sys­tem by work­ing with de­vel­op­ers to build re­ten­tion ponds, and up­grad­ing drainage in­fra­struc­ture while pro­vid­ing flood pro­tec­tion through strate­gies like set­ting min­i­mum plat­form lev­els, said a PUB spokesman.</p>
    <p>The size of flood-prone ar­eas here has dropped from 3,200ha in the 1970s to 28ha over the past 50 years, she said, adding that floods nowa­days are lo­calised and usu­ally sub­side within 30 min­utes.</p>
    <p>She said: “Sin­ga­pore is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing more in­tense and fre­quent rain­storms, and our drains can­not be widened and deep­ened in­def­i­nitely to ac­com­mo­date every ex­treme rain­fall event, given that Sin­ga­pore is land-scarce.</p>
    <p>“Hence, ev­ery­one has a part to play in build­ing flood re­silience.”</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the public, for ex­am­ple, should help to keep canals and wa­ter­ways free of lit­ter so that storm water can flow un­ob­structed, she added.</p>
