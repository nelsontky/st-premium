    <p>KHAM­NEE MARTIN THRU­MA­L­INGGAM</p>
    <p>AGE 28 HEIGHT 1.61m WEIGHT 49kg</p>
    <p>Ms Kham­nee Martin Thru­ma­l­inggam has en­joyed run­ning since child­hood.</p>
    <p>She was in the track and field team at St An­thony’s Pri­mary School and Chua Chu Kang Sec­ondary School.</p>
    <p>How­ever, af­ter the Ngee Ann Polytech­nic mass com­mu­ni­ca­tion grad­u­ate be­came an air stew­ardess with Sin­ga­pore Air­lines, her er­ratic work sched­ule did not al­low much time for ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>She thus took a long break from run­ning in her mid-20s.</p>
    <p>It was only af­ter she moved two years ago to Mu­nich to be with her then boyfriend, French­man Mathias Martin Bouchet, a se­nior busi­ness con­troller, that she started to ex­er­cise reg­u­larly again.</p>
    <p>They got mar­ried last year. She says: “When I was based in Mu­nich two years ago, I was in a new place and did not know any­one ex­cept my hus­band.</p>
    <p>“This took a toll on my men­tal health – jug­gling an in­ten­sive pro­fes­sional ca­reer as well as get­ting used to a new en­vi­ron­ment.”</p>
    <p>Feel­ing eas­ily fa­tigued, she de­cided to join a gym with Mr Bouchet, who is also 28, and picked up kick­box­ing.</p>
    <p>Turn­ing to ex­er­cise helped her feel bet­ter men­tally and phys­i­cally. “The highly in­ten­sive work­outs helped me build strength and I felt more re­laxed af­ter each kick­box­ing ses­sion,” says Ms Thru­ma­l­inggam, who is based in Mu­nich and works as a com­mu­ni­ca­tions spe­cial­ist at a com­pany called In­terNa­tions, where she man­ages events for ex­pa­tri­ates in Amer­ica and the Caribbean. She is in Sin­ga­pore on hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>On days when she is not free to hit the gym or run out­side, she does yoga at home.</p>
    <p>She says: “In­cor­po­rat­ing a well-bal­anced diet and try­ing dif­fer­ent forms of work­outs have helped me be­come a hap­pier and health­ier per­son.</p>
    <p>“It is true that hav­ing a healthy body helps you main­tain a healthy mind.”</p>
