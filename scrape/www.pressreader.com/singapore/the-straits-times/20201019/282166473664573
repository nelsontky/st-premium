    <p>Do­ing good for the en­vi­ron­ment may have an ad­verse im­pact on fi­nances or re­sources, Ms An­nie Yeow learned at the Sin­ga­pore cam­pus of James Cook Univer­sity ( JCU).</p>
    <p>The 26-year-old, who grad­u­ated in 2016, now works in Swe­den as a man­u­fac­tur­ing tech­ni­cian for North­volt, a bat­tery man­u­fac­turer and de­vel­oper. She says her stud­ies helped shape her per­spec­tive on un­der­stand­ing sus­tain­abil­ity in a busi­ness con­text.</p>
    <p>“My knowl­edge from JCU helps me un­der­stand what ar­eas the com­pany can im­prove on, how to re­duce wastage and make the busi­ness more sus­tain­able in the man­u­fac­tur­ing process,” says Ms Yeow.</p>
    <p>A strong pas­sion for the en­vi­ron­ment led her to pur­sue a diploma in En­vi­ron­men­tal Sci­ence at Repub­lic Polytech­nic. Af­ter grad­u­a­tion, she wanted to pur­sue a de­gree that would fur­ther her un­der­stand­ing of the sub­ject, and re­search led her to dis­cover that JCU of­fered a</p>
    <p>Bach­e­lor of Busi­ness and En­vi­ron­men­tal Sci­ence pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Pur­su­ing a de­gree that fo­cuses on both busi­ness and en­vi­ron­men­tal sci­ence has al­lowed Ms Yeow to see is­sues from dif­fer­ent, some­times op­pos­ing per­spec­tives.</p>
    <p>“Un­der­stand­ing how busi­nesses work is im­por­tant as there can­not be sus­tain­abil­ity with­out first know­ing how they can progress and im­prove,” she says.</p>
    <p>As a young un­der­grad­u­ate, she had the im­pres­sion that any­thing with a neg­a­tive im­pact on the en­vi­ron­ment was un­ac­cept­able — un­til a mod­ule on En­vi­ron­men­tal Eco­nomics changed her view.</p>
    <p>“It re­ally made me think about the im­pact of de­ci­sions holis­ti­cally — whether an ac­tion taken to im­prove the en­vi­ron­ment would un­in­ten­tion­ally harm an­other part of it,” she re­calls.</p>
    <p>From then on, she gained a new ap­pre­ci­a­tion for the need to make well-bal­anced and thought-out de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>An­other huge part of her univer­sity days that pre­pared her for work was her in­ter­ac­tion with stu­dents from dif­fer­ent coun­tries, as JCU is an Aus­tralian univer­sity.</p>
    <p>A mod­ule on Cross-Cul­tural Man­age­ment also helped her im­mensely when she started work at North­volt, which has more than 600 em­ploy­ees from nearly 70 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>And while she did not par­tic­i­pate in JCU’s In­ter-cam­pus Mo­bil­ity Pro­gram, which al­lows stu­dents to study for two semesters in the Aus­tralian cam­puses, Ms Yeow be­lieves it’s ben­e­fi­cial for stu­dents to ex­pe­ri­ence study­ing in an­other coun­try.</p>
    <p>To fu­ture stu­dents, con­sid­er­ing the same course, she has this piece of ad­vice: “When try­ing to bet­ter the en­vi­ron­ment, it’s also im­por­tant to look at other ar­eas such as cost, to see how ev­ery­thing is in­ter­re­lated.</p>
    <p>“It’s all about sus­tain­abil­ity. We should not only aim to be en­vi­ron­men­tally sound, but sus­tain­able, so that we have a longer and bet­ter fu­ture.”</p>
