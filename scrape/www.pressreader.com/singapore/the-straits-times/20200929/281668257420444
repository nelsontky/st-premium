    <p>•</p>
    <p>PARIS More than one mil­lion peo­ple have died from the novel coro­n­avirus, af­ter the deadly disease emerged in China less than a year ago and swept around the globe.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has rav­aged the world’s econ­omy, in­flamed geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions and up­ended lives, from In­dia’s slums to Amer­ica’s big­gest city New York.</p>
    <p>Dras­tic con­trols that put half of hu­man­ity – more than four bil­lion peo­ple – un­der some form of lock­down by April at first slowed its pace, but cases have soared again since re­stric­tions were eased.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day night, the disease had claimed just over a mil­lion vic­tims from more than 33 mil­lion recorded in­fec­tions, ac­cord­ing to an Agence France-Presse tally us­ing of­fi­cial sources.</p>
    <p>The United States has the high­est death toll with more than 204,000 fa­tal­i­ties fol­lowed by Brazil, In­dia, Mex­ico and Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>For Ital­ian truck driver Carlo Chiodi, 50, those grim fig­ures in­clude both his par­ents, whom he lost within days of each other.</p>
    <p>“I saw my fa­ther walk­ing out of the house, get­ting into the am­bu­lance, and all I could say to him was ‘good­bye’,” said Mr Chiodi. “I re­gret not say­ing ‘I love you’ and I re­gret not hug­ging him. That still hurts me.”</p>
    <p>With sci­en­tists still rac­ing to find a work­ing vac­cine, gov­ern­ments are again forced into an un­easy balanc­ing act: Virus con­trols slow the spread of the disease, but they hurt al­ready reel­ing economies.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund ear­lier this year warned that the eco­nomic up­heaval could cause a “cri­sis like no other” as the world’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct col­lapsed.</p>
    <p>Europe, hit hard by the first wave, is fac­ing an­other surge in cases, with Paris, Lon­don and Madrid forced to in­tro­duce curbs to slow in­fec­tions threat­en­ing to over­load hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>Masks and so­cial dis­tanc­ing in shops, cafes and public trans­port are now part of ev­ery­day life in many cities.</p>
    <p>The mid­dle of this month saw a record rise in cases in most re­gions and the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) has warned virus deaths could dou­ble to two mil­lion with­out more global col­lec­tive ac­tion.</p>
    <p>The Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes the ill­ness known as Covid-19 made its first known ap­pear­ance in the cen­tral Chi­nese city of Wuhan and the city was shut down in Jan­uary. How it got there is still un­clear.</p>
    <p>By March 11, the virus had emerged in over 100 coun­tries and the WHO de­clared a pan­demic, ex­press­ing con­cern about the “alarm­ing lev­els of in­ac­tion”.</p>
    <p>Dr Pa­trick Vogt, a fam­ily doc­tor in Mul­house, a city that be­came the out­break’s epi­cen­tre in France in March, said he re­alised the coro­n­avirus was ev­ery­where when doc­tors started fall­ing ill, some dy­ing.</p>
    <p>“We saw peo­ple in our surgery who had re­ally big breath­ing prob­lems, young and not-so-young who were ex­hausted,” he said.</p>
    <p>Nor did the virus spare the rich or fa­mous. Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son spent a week in hos­pi­tal. Pop star Madonna tested pos­i­tive af­ter a tour of France, as did ac­tor Tom Hanks and his wife who re­cov­ered and re­turned home to Los Angeles af­ter quar­an­tine in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>The Tokyo Olympics, Rio’s famed Car­ni­val and the Mus­lim pil­grim­age to Mecca are among the ma­jor events post­poned or dis­rupted by the pan­demic. Premier League football has restarted but with empty sta­di­ums.</p>
    <p>Is­rael has gone into full lock­down again and Mos­cow’s vul­ner­a­ble have been or­dered to stay home.</p>
    <p>As the re­stric­tions tighten, protests and anger are ris­ing as busi­nesses worry about their sur­vival and in­di­vid­u­als grow frus­trated.</p>
    <p>Along with the tur­moil, though, lies some hope, with Wuhan now ap­pear­ing to have con­trolled the disease. Cru­cially, nine vac­cine can­di­dates are in last-stage clin­i­cal tri­als, with hopes some will be rolled out next year, though ques­tions re­main about how and when they will be dis­trib­uted around the world.</p>
    <p>The mid­dle of this month saw a record rise in cases in most re­gions and the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion has warned virus deaths could dou­ble to two mil­lion with­out more global col­lec­tive ac­tion.</p>
