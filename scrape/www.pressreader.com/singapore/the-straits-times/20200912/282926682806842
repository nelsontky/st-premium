    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Be pre­pared to scream again.</p>
    <p>Cana­dian ac­tress Neve Camp­bell (left), who is known for her role as Sid­ney Prescott in the Scream slasher films (1996 to 2011), has signed on to reprise her role in the fifth in­stal­ment of the fran­chise, ac­cord­ing to a joint state­ment by Spy­glass Me­dia Group and Paramount Pic­tures on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Camp­bell, 46, will be joined by David Ar­quette and Courteney Cox, who ap­peared with her in the pre­vi­ous four movies and will re­turn as Dewey Ri­ley and Gale Weath­ers re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The new movie, which has new cast mem­bers Jack Quaid, Melissa Bar­rera and Jenna Ortega, is sched­uled to be re­leased in Jan­uary 2022.</p>
    <p>In the press state­ment, Camp­bell said she was “be­yond ex­cited to step back into the role of Sid­ney Prescott and re­turn to Woods­boro”, re­fer­ring to the fic­tional town of the movies.</p>
    <p>The new movie is helmed by Matt Bet­tinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gil­lett, who have di­rected hor­ror movies such as V/H/S (2012), Devil’s Due (2014) and Ready Or Not (2019).</p>
    <p>Scream is a long-run­ning gen­re­bust­ing hor­ror fran­chise, which gen­er­ated four fea­ture films – Scream (1996), Scream 2 (1997), Scream 3 (2000) and Scream 4 (2011).</p>
    <p>In the movies, a high school in Woods­boro is tar­geted by a cloaked killer called Ghost­face, who wears a ghoul­ish mask based on The Scream paint­ing by Nor­we­gian painter Ed­vard Munch. The killer usu­ally taunts Prescott with a phone call be­gin­ning with “Hello, Sid­ney”.</p>
    <p>Di­rected by the late Wes Craven, the famed “mae­stro of hor­ror”, the four films went on to gross more than US$600 mil­lion in world­wide box-of­fice re­ceipts.</p>
    <p>Camp­bell has also starred in the ac­tion thriller Sky­scraper (2018), the drama Cas­tle In The Ground (2019) and Net­flix’s po­lit­i­cal thriller se­ries House Of Cards (2013 to 2018).</p>
