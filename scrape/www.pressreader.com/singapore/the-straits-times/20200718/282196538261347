    <p>With their me­tal­lic ex­te­rior, the box-like iso­la­tion rooms at Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hospi­tal’s newly built Ward@Bowyer re­sem­ble fu­tur­is­tic cap­sules shel­ter­ing peo­ple from the hus­tle and bus­tle of space travel.</p>
    <p>And they are in­deed the bas­tions of peace they seem to be, for once I get past the door, it is as if time is stand­ing still.</p>
    <p>Bored dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker? Just wait till you are in an iso­la­tion room. On Wed­nes­day, I spent four hours in one at Ward@Bowyer, be­fore it took in its first pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients in the 50-room ward must be able to walk about, take care of them­selves and be in a con­di­tion as­sessed as less likely to get worse. Okay, check, no prob­lem there. I was ush­ered into room A6 at 8.20am by two nurses clad in full per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment af­ter they ver­i­fied my iden­ti­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Each tightly sealed room – com­pris­ing a bed, side ta­ble and an at­tached toi­let and shower – is 2.3m by 5.6m, with a height of 2.5m.</p>
    <p>It is not the tini­est of rooms, but there is not a lot of space.</p>
    <p>The room is kept at a lower pres­sure than the out­side so that vi­ral par­ti­cles in­side will not es­cape when the door is opened.</p>
    <p>Fresh air from out­side is pumped into the room, and the con­tam­i­nated air in­side is re­moved through a neg­a­tive pres­sure unit fit­ted with a Hepa fil­ter at the foot of the bed.</p>
    <p>In the room, the nurses took my blood pres­sure and walked me through the ad­mis­sions pack, in­room smart­phone and a biosen­sor that must be worn at all times, ex­cept when in the shower.</p>
    <p>The biosen­sor is worn around the right wrist like a watch, with the sen­sor wrapped around the ring fin­ger like a plaster. It wire­lessly sends pa­tients’ heart rate, res­pi­ra­tion rate and oxy­gen sat­u­ra­tion level read­ings to the clin­i­cians.</p>
    <p>That is all well and good, but my chief con­cern was, of course, Wi-Fi, given that the 3,200 sq m ward is built on a carpark. For­tu­nately, the In­ter­net con­nec­tion was de­cent.</p>
    <p>The bed felt hard, but the room was set at a com­fort­able 24 deg C, and this is ad­justable upon re­quest.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the doc­tor “checked in” on me at 9am, the lull be­gan. The room was silent ex­cept for the air-con­di­tioner’s whir and the oc­ca­sional faint mur­mur of nurses out­side.</p>
    <p>The in-room smart­phone is a life­saver in all ways. It al­lows pa­tients to con­tact the nurses through video­con­fer­enc­ing or via an app if they feel un­well or need as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>It also con­tains nine games for pa­tients to pass the time.</p>
    <p>At 9.30am, I started on a word search puz­zle and tried other games.</p>
    <p>When I looked up from the phone,</p>
    <p>I thought a good 30 min­utes had passed, but it was only 9.40am.</p>
    <p>I spent the next 50 min­utes at­tend­ing to press­ing e-mails and tak­ing pho­tos and videos of the room.</p>
    <p>This passed by quickly.</p>
    <p>But the pace be­came glacial once I was done. Out of sheer bore­dom, I started to count the num­ber of holes on the Hepa fil­ter.</p>
    <p>Wait. Still only 10.50am?</p>
    <p>A nurse gave me a thumbs-up through the nar­row, trans­par­ent win­dow at the door.</p>
    <p>I felt a much-needed rush of warmth and hu­man touch.</p>
    <p>I re­turned to the smart­phone and browsed the multi-lan­guage reading ma­te­ri­als. It was an­other in­ter­minable in­ter­lude be­fore lunch was dropped off at 11.40am on a chair I had to place at the door.</p>
    <p>Be­fore be­ing “dis­charged”, I had to clean my shoes and bag with an­timi­cro­bial wipes. Pa­tients will have to clean the bed­side ta­ble and chair, shower and change be­fore leav­ing. The room is then dis­in­fected, and any re­main­ing micro­organ­isms killed by UV light.</p>
    <p>I left at noon, af­ter what felt like the long­est four hours of my life.</p>
    <p>And Covid-19 pa­tients in iso­la­tion stay for about 14 days.</p>
    <p>I silently vowed to my­self that I will wear my mask, ob­serve safe dis­tanc­ing rules and keep to the high­est clean­li­ness stan­dards.</p>
    <p>I spent the next 50 min­utes at­tend­ing to press­ing e-mails and tak­ing pho­tos and videos of the room. This passed by quickly. But the pace be­came glacial once I was done.</p>
