    <p>For Sin­ga­porean singer-song­writer Zuo En, the idea to re­lease an al­bum did not come from her, but her friends.</p>
    <p>“Many peo­ple around me said I should re­lease an al­bum, so I de­cided to take up on their sug­ges­tion and do it,” ex­plains the mu­sic in­struc­tor, who re­leased a sin­gle, Phan­tasm, in 2010.</p>
    <p>Her voice has also been fea­tured in song­writ­ing com­pe­ti­tions such as Eco Mu­sic Chal­lenge 2011 and 2012, as well as song­writ­ing fes­ti­val SG:SW2019 I Write The Songs.</p>
    <p>De­spite it not be­ing her idea, this de­but al­bum, with its colour­ful, whim­si­cal cover, grew to be­come a neat way to ex­press her unique and at times quirky take on life. It was re­leased in March, and its ti­tle, zuo, comes from a char­ac­ter in her Chi­nese name.</p>
    <p>The fact that it was re­leased dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic was a bit of a pity, she ad­mits, as she could not per­form the new songs at venues. But she has per­formed some of them on­line.</p>
    <p>Think­ing back on the work’s cre­ation, she re­calls that it was a long jour­ney of ex­plo­ration and re­flec­tion, in­ter­rupted by bouts of pro­cras­ti­na­tion.</p>
    <p>“To be hon­est, I felt strange shar­ing and singing about per­sonal emo­tions in such a pub­lic way. I felt a lit­tle fear­ful re­leas­ing this al­bum, so I kept ques­tion­ing my­self and try­ing to find a di­rec­tion for the work.”</p>
    <p>Even­tu­ally, she set­tled on eight songs, some of which are based on daily ob­ser­va­tions.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, Our Fin­gers Have All Fallen Ill looks at peo­ple’s ob­ses­sion with smart­phones and mes­sages that have to be replied to right away. How­ever anx­i­ety-in­duc­ing such prac­tices are, she ac­cepts them as part of mod­ern liv­ing.</p>
    <p>“Some­times, my mother will nag at me to put down my phone dur­ing meals, so I am also guilty of be­ing glued to it.”</p>
    <p>An­other song, Pre­ten­tious Cou­ple, is a light-hearted waltz that pokes fun at a pair of care­free lovers who do not mind the judg­ment of oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Zuo En, who is sin­gle, says that with so­cial me­dia, cou­ples nowa­days of­ten write lovey-dovey com­ments to and about each other on­line. She finds this both laugh­ably sweet and mildly ir­ri­tat­ing.</p>
    <p>Other num­bers are in­spired by peo­ple in her life. The angsty third track, I Think You’d Best Be Quiet, is based on an ac­quain­tance who she dis­cov­ered had bad-mouthed her be­hind her back.</p>
    <p>“Writ­ing the song was my way of vent­ing my anger and frus­tra­tion. I don’t re­ally care if this per­son knows... At least I got it off my chest.”</p>
    <p>In­deed, song­writ­ing for her has pri­mar­ily been about self-ex­pres­sion and get­ting to the heart of her emo­tions.</p>
    <p>In the open­ing num­ber, What Kind Of, she asks: “What is my true self re­ally like?” While mak­ing the al­bum, she asked her­self the ques­tion many times.</p>
    <p>And has she come closer to an­swer­ing it? Yes, she says.</p>
    <p>“I am some­one who wants the best for my songs. I can be very fo­cused on im­prov­ing some­thing, even when I know I should let it go and move on. So I am learn­ing not to be like this.”</p>
    <p>Over the last decade, she has also learnt to be more as­sertive, con­fi­dent and bet­ter at look­ing out for her­self.</p>
    <p>“Maybe it comes with age,” says the 32-year-old.</p>
    <p>“When I was younger, there were times I did not dare to speak up or take MC (sick leave) even when I was ill. Now, I re­alise it is im­por­tant to put your­self first. Be­cause if you can­not take care of your­self, how can you help oth­ers?”</p>
    <p>zuo is avail­able on on­line mu­sic plat­forms such as KKBox, Ap­ple Mu­sic and Spo­tify. CDs are avail­able at $20 each at joan­net­zuoen.com</p>
