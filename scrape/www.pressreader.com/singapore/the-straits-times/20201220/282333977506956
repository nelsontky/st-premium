    <p>Dec 3, 2020: a date that will live in in­famy for cin­e­mas.</p>
    <p>In the United States, it was the day news broke that ma­jor stu­dio Warner Bros would re­lease its 2021 slate of films in cin­e­mas and the HBO Max stream­ing ser­vice at the same time. It came af­ter Dis­ney, as an ex­per­i­ment, re­leased its pe­riod fan­tasy Mu­lan (be­low) on its Dis­ney+ ser­vice in the US in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Cin­e­mas are the mid­dle­men be­tween stu­dios like Warner and Dis­ney and au­di­ences.</p>
    <p>The writ­ing is on the wall: In the era of a pan­demic that has seen ticket sales go into freefall, stu­dios want to reach con­sumers di­rectly.</p>
    <p>Then on Dec 10, news broke that cin­ema chains Cathay and Golden Vil­lage, bat­tered by the pan­demic, had pro­posed a merger to save costs and at­tract new in­vestors.</p>
    <p>It was as if they knew some­thing be­cause, the next day, Dis­ney an­nounced that it would launch the Dis­ney+ ser­vice in Sin­ga­pore on Feb 23 next year.</p>
    <p>If the pan­demic lingers into 2021, it would make sense for Dis­ney to do an­other Mu­lan and launch new Pixar, Stars Wars and Marvel su­per­hero movies on­line at the same time as or soon af­ter they open in cin­e­mas.</p>
    <p>There is no news yet on when HBO Max will come to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s cin­ema chains have not been sit­ting idle. Cathay, Shaw and in­die cin­ema The Pro­jec­tor have launched their own video-on-de­mand (VOD) sites, as have film dis­trib­u­tors like An­tic­i­pate Pic­tures. But it will be an up­hill climb be­cause VOD sites, with their a la carte pric­ing, look less en­tic­ing next to sub­scrip­tion play­ers like Dis­ney+.</p>
    <p>This year car­ries a whiff of the In­ter­net boom of the late 1990s, when the Web gold rush was at its peak.</p>
    <p>Bil­lions have been spent by es­tab­lished play­ers like Net­flix. Bil­lions more will be spent by newer en­trants Ap­ple TV+, Dis­ney+ and HBO Max in a bid to lock in eye­balls.</p>
    <p>Stream­ing ser­vice Hooq, backed by tele­coms com­pany Sing­tel, among oth­ers, folded in May this year. It just could not add enough sub­scribers with the kind of con­tent it had.</p>
    <p>Un­like Dis­ney+ and HBO Max (owned by Warn­erMe­dia, which also owns Warner Bros stu­dio), it was not able to make shows peo­ple wanted to see.</p>
    <p>To make a food anal­ogy: From 2021, the fu­ture is stream­ing, but from com­pa­nies that own the restau­rant, along with the farms, kitchens and killer recipes. John Lui</p>
