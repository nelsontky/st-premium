    <p>There has not been a dis­pro­por­tion­ate shift in sup­port away from the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party among mi­nor­ity vot­ers, Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We have not done a very com­pre­hen­sive study be­cause all of this is on­go­ing, but in the broad scans that we have seen in dif­fer­ent con­stituen­cies, it has not been the case that ar­eas with high pro­por­tions of mi­nor­ity groups have swung sig­nif­i­cantly against us,” he told re­porters. He was re­ply­ing to a ques­tion on sup­port for the PAP from eth­nic mi­nori­ties in GE2020 at a press con­fer­ence at the PAP’s head­quar­ters in Be­dok.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong cited his own con­stituency, Mar­sil­ing-Yew Tee GRC, not­ing that the Mar­sil­ing and Wood­lands ar­eas of the four-mem­ber group rep­re­sen­ta­tion con­stituency have a sig­nif­i­cantly higher share of mi­nor­ity fam­i­lies com­pared with the na­tional av­er­age.</p>
    <p>But from what he has ob­served, it was not the case that the polling dis­tricts with a higher mi­nor­ity share swung more sig­nif­i­cantly.</p>
    <p>“We did not see that pat­tern. It’s pre­ma­ture to con­clude and make a gen­er­alised state­ment about how they might have voted,” he said.</p>
    <p>“There may be dif­fer­ent pat­terns across dif­fer­ent con­stituen­cies but I would not be able to say at the over­all level, whether or not there was any swing amongst the mi­nor­ity group at this stage.”</p>
    <p>He added: “Even if they had voted against us, it might not have been an is­sue of race or the is­sues that they iden­ti­fied with as a com­mu­nity, but re­lated more to na­tional is­sues – around jobs, around in­comes as well. So we will have to tease out the fac­tors.”</p>
    <p>The PAP won 63.18 per cent of the vote in Mar­sil­ing-Yew Tee GRC against a Sin­ga­pore Demo­cratic Party team, down from 68.73 per cent in GE2015. This was a smaller swing than the 8.7 per­cent­age point drop na­tion­wide.</p>
    <p>Asked if the re­sult would have been dif­fer­ent if the elec­tion were held later, Mr Wong said: “Covid-19 is go­ing to be with us for many, many more months... very, very likely till next year. I can’t see any pos­si­bil­ity of this di­min­ish­ing at the end of the year.”</p>
