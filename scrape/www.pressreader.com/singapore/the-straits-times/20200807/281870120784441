    <p>COLOMBO • The brothers rul­ing Sri Lanka took an early lead yes­ter­day in an elec­tion that will de­cide whether Pres­i­dent Gotabaya Ra­japaksa can push through con­tentious con­sti­tu­tional changes to re­store sweep­ing ex­ec­u­tive pow­ers to his of­fice.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Ra­japaksa – who has run a mi­nor­ity gov­ern­ment since he won a Novem­ber pres­i­den­tial poll and ap­pointed his brother and f ormer strong­man l eader Mahinda as the prime min­is­ter – wants to win a two-thirds ma­jor­ity in the is­land’s 225-seat leg­is­la­ture.</p>
    <p>That will al­low him to bol­ster the role of the pres­i­dency to give him greater in­flu­ence over the ju­di­ciary, mil­i­tary and bu­reau­cracy.</p>
    <p>A con­sti­tu­tional amend­ment un­der for­mer prime min­is­ter Ranil Wick­resinghe’s United Na­tional Party gov­ern­ment had clipped some of those pres­i­den­tial pow­ers.</p>
    <p>With about 5 per cent of the polling di­vi­sions de­clared, the Pres­i­dent’s Sri Lanka Po­du­jana Per­a­muna (SLPP) party led by 66.6 per cent to 16.2 per cent for Mr Sa­jith Pre­madasa’s Sa­m­agi Jana Balawe­gaya party, ac­cord­ing to state tele­vi­sion Ru­pavahini. Ini­tial re­turns in­cluded postal bal­lots and polling di­vi­sions in the north­ern Jaffna penin­sula and south­ern Galle and Matara dis­tricts.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Ra­japaksa’s SLPP faced a weak­ened op­po­si­tion in this par­lia­men­tary elec­tion as Mr Pre­madasa, his main ri­val in the pres­i­den­tial poll, broke away from the United Na­tional Party ear­lier this year and set up a new party with some of its younger and more pro­gres­sive mem­bers.</p>
    <p>“A two-thirds ma­jor­ity would lead to a pres­i­dent with ab­so­lute po­lit­i­cal power – the great­est con­cen­tra­tion we have seen in Sri Lanka – de­plet­ing power of the prime min­is­ter,” said Mr Dayan Jayatillek­a, Sri Lanka’s for­mer per­ma­nent rep­re­sen­ta­tive to t he United Na­tions. “The hope with a sim­ple ma­jor­ity is for the func­tion­ing of a nor­mal po­lit­i­cal sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>Sri Lanka’s ru­pee was 0.1 per cent higher at 185.41 to the US dol­lar at 4.17pm lo­cal time while the bench­mark Colombo All-Share In­dex closed up 0.6 per cent at 5176.85.</p>
    <p>Wed­nes­day’s vote was ini­tially set for April 25 af­ter Pres­i­dent Ra­japaksa called for early elec­tions in March, but it was post­poned twice due to health and safety con­cerns, re­sult­ing in an ex­tended pe­riod when a care­taker gov­ern­ment made pol­icy de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>As de­fence sec­re­tary un­der Mr Mahinda Ra­japaksa, Mr Gotabaya Ra­japaksa led the cam­paign to de­feat the Tamil Tiger rebels in 2009. He re­ceived strong sup­port from the na­tion’s ma­jor­ity Sin­hala-Bud­dhists in the pres­i­den­tial poll, while the mi­nor­ity Tamils and Mus­lims sup­ported Mr Pre­madasa.</p>
    <p>Shortly af­ter his vic­tory, Pres­i­dent Ra­japaksa an­nounced tax cuts and a mora­to­rium on debt for small busi­nesses in or­der to kick­start the econ­omy bat­tered by po­lit­i­cal tur­moil since late 2018 and last year’s Easter Sun­day ter­ror at­tacks.</p>
    <p>CON­CEN­TRA­TION OF POWER</p>
    <p>A two-thirds ma­jor­ity would lead to a pres­i­dent with ab­so­lute po­lit­i­cal power – the great­est con­cen­tra­tion we have seen in Sri Lanka – de­plet­ing power of the ’’ prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>MR DAYAN JAYATILLEK­A, Sri Lanka’s for­mer per­ma­nent UN rep­re­sen­ta­tive.</p>
