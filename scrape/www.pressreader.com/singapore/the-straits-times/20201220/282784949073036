    <p>MI­AMI • Ko Jin-young is plac­ing thoughts of her world rank­ing aside as she fired five birdies in a five-un­der 67 on Fri­day to seize a one-stroke lead over fel­low South Korean Kim Sei-young and Amer­i­can Lexi Thomp­son in the LPGA Tour Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>World No. 1 Ko, play­ing just her fourth LPGA event of the pan­demic-dis­rupted sea­son, had a 36-hole to­tal of nine-un­der 135.</p>
    <p>With a US$1.1 mil­lion (S$1.5 mil­lion) win­ner’s prize on of­fer, she could end up top­ping the 2020 money list with a win de­spite mak­ing so few starts.</p>
    <p>She was not even as­sured a place in the Tour Cham­pi­onship un­til she tied for sec­ond in the US Women’s Open last week.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she was try­ing to fo­cus on her game, rather than the tro­phy or the fact that one of her clos­est pur­suers, Kim, is also chas­ing her for the world No. 1 rank­ing.</p>
    <p>“World rank­ing, my opin­ion is it’s just (do­ing) lit­tle things to play golf,” she said. “So if I play good I can do world rank­ing No. 1 still. If not and then she plays good she can do it... it doesn’t re­ally mat­ter.”</p>
    <p>The sec­ond-placed duo was the last two win­ners of the sea­so­nend­ing event at Tiburon Golf Club in Naples, Florida: 2019 cham­pion Kim and 2018 win­ner Thomp­son.</p>
    <p>Kim signed for a sec­ond-round 69 while overnight leader Thomp­son, seek­ing a first vic­tory this year, carded a 71.</p>
    <p>Ko, three adrift to start the day, gained steam with birdies at the sixth and 10th, then picked up three strokes in the space of four holes with birdies at the 14th, 15th and 17th. She drained a long birdie putt at the 15th for a share of the lead and was alone in front af­ter a birdie at the par-five 17th.</p>
    <p>“I want to go bo­gey-free (the) next two days, so I’m look­ing for­ward to the week­end,” she said.</p>
    <p>Kim got off to a siz­zling start, with four birdies in the first five holes be­fore bo­geys at the sev­enth and ninth. She tapped in a birdie putt at 14 that briefly gave her the solo lead on eight-un­der, but she could not find an­other birdie as Ko edged ahead.</p>
    <p>Thomp­son, seven-un­der to start the day, made a promis­ing start with a birdie at the sec­ond, but stalled with bo­geys at the third and ninth. She was back in con­tention with birdies at the 14th and 15th, and main­tained her mo­men­tum with a su­perb up and down from a tough lie in the bunker at the 17th.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Han­nah Green, whose two LPGA ti­tles in­clude the 2019 Women’s PGA Cham­pi­onship, fired five birdies in a fou­run­der 68 that put her in solo fourth on 137.</p>
