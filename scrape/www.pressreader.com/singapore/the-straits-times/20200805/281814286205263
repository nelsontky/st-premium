    <p>YANGON • Myan­mar leader Aung San Suu Kyi yes­ter­day for­mally de­clared her in­ten­tion to seek a sec­ond term in an elec­tion in Novem­ber that is seen as a test of the South-east Asian na­tion’s ten­ta­tive demo­cratic re­forms.</p>
    <p>Af­ter decades of mil­i­tary rule, Ms Suu Kyi, who won the No­bel Peace Prize for cam­paign­ing for democ­racy, took the reins in 2016 af­ter an elec­toral land­slide, but has been forced to share power with the gen­er­als.</p>
    <p>Her in­ter­na­tional rep­u­ta­tion slumped over Myan­mar’s treat­ment of Ro­hingya Mus­lims, but she re­mains pop­u­lar at home, where her im­age is un­dented by ac­cu­sa­tions of com­plic­ity in atroc­i­ties against the mi­nor­ity group.</p>
    <p>Ms Suu Kyi, 75, yes­ter­day waved to a crowd of around 50 sup­port­ers on the out­skirts of the for­mer cap­i­tal Yangon to sub­mit an ap­pli­ca­tion to run as a can­di­date.</p>
    <p>Some of her sup­port­ers wore red-coloured face masks de­not­ing their back­ing for her Na­tional League for Democ­racy party and shouted: “Mother Suu, be healthy.”</p>
    <p>In 2017, a mil­i­tary-led crack­down in Myan­mar re­sulted in more than 730,000 Ro­hingya flee­ing across the bor­der to Bangladesh, where they took shel­ter in refugee camps.</p>
    <p>United Na­tions in­ves­ti­ga­tors con­cluded that the mil­i­tary cam­paign had been ex­e­cuted with “geno­ci­dal in­tent”.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, Ms Suu Kyi ad­mit­ted that war crimes may have been com­mit­ted against Ro­hingya, but de­nied geno­cide, say­ing refugees had ex­ag­ger­ated the ex­tent of abuses against them.</p>
    <p>Mainly-Mus­lim Gam­bia had filed a suit last Novem­ber at the In­ter­na­tional Court of Jus­tice ac­cus­ing</p>
    <p>Myan­mar of “on­go­ing geno­cide” against the Ro­hingya.</p>
    <p>Myan­mar has filed a re­port on its ad­her­ence to mea­sures to pro­tect the Ro­hingya, but de­tails of the doc­u­ment have not been pub­lished.</p>
    <p>On the do­mes­tic front, Ms Suu Kyi’s ad­min­is­tra­tion has had fal­ter­ing peace talks with eth­nic armed groups in var­i­ous parts of the coun­try, while a strug­gling econ­omy faces new pres­sure from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Union Sol­i­dar­ity and De­vel­op­ment Party, which is dom­i­nated by the mil­i­tary and re­tired civil ser­vants, will be the main op­po­nent of the Na­tional League for Democ­racy.</p>
