    <p>ment was due to a con­sol­i­da­tion of new en­ti­ties that boosted rev­enue. Th­ese en­ti­ties are Coun­try Foods, Nan­jing Weizhou Air­line Food and Monty’s Bake­house UK.</p>
    <p>Sats’ group ex­pen­di­ture de­creased by 39.9 per cent on the year to $245.4 mil­lion, with staff cost see­ing the most sig­nif­i­cant re­duc­tion – down 58.7 per cent to $96.5 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The drop in staff cost was due to a com­bi­na­tion of fac­tors such as govern­ment grants, lower con­tract ser­vices and a re­duc­tion in work­force re­quired to man­age lower vol­umes.</p>
    <p>Li­cence fees were also lower, in line with smaller avi­a­tion rev­enue.</p>
    <p>No div­i­dend was de­clared for the quar­ter, un­changed from a year ago.</p>
    <p>Sats pays div­i­dends on a semi-an­nual ba­sis for every six-month pe­riod end­ing March 31 and Sept 30, sub­ject to re­view and ap­proval.</p>
    <p>Sats shares closed up 5.48 per cent at $3.08 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>SYDNEY • Qan­tas Air­ways said yes­ter­day that its in­ter­na­tional di­vi­sion head Tino La Spina would leave the com­pany, in a cost-sav­ing move at a time when the air­line has grounded all in­ter­na­tional fly­ing due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The head of its do­mes­tic busi­ness, Mr An­drew David, will also take over the re­spon­si­bil­i­ties of Mr La Spina, a for­mer Qan­tas chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer who spent 14 years at the com­pany and is well known to in­vestors, when he l eaves at the end of the month.</p>
    <p>Qan­tas chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Alan Joyce said it had be­come in­creas­ingly clear that the air­line’s in­ter­na­tional flights would be grounded un­til at least the mid­dle of 2021 and it would take years for fly­ing to re­turn to his­tor­i­cal lev­els.</p>
    <p>“Un­der those cir­cum­stances, we’ve made the de­ci­sion to con­sol­i­date the do­mes­tic and in­ter­na­tional busi­ness units un­der a sin­gle di­vi­sional CEO,” Mr Joyce said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The changes will take ef­fect from Sept 1, the air­line said.</p>
    <p>It added that Mr Joyce would be on re­duced pay of 65 per cent of nor­mal lev­els un­til Novem­ber, while the rest of his ex­ec­u­tive team would be on 85 per cent of nor­mal pay as part of its re­sponse to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Qan­tas last week said state bor­der clo­sures were se­verely ham­per­ing a re­cov­ery in the do­mes­tic avi­a­tion mar­ket which, along­side its lack of in­ter­na­tional fly­ing, would lead to a sig­nif­i­cant loss this fi­nan­cial year.</p>
    <p>Cit­i­group an­a­lyst Jakob Cakar­nis fore­casts the air­line will re­port an un­der­ly­ing pre-tax loss of around A$260 mil­lion (S$256 mil­lion) in the year end­ing June 30, 2021, ac­cord­ing to a note to clients on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Qan­tas shares have fallen about 47 per cent since the start of Jan­uary.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Rev&#xAD;enue for Sats&#x2019; food so&#xAD;lu&#xAD;tions seg&#xAD;ment was down 43.7 per cent to $135.9 mil&#xAD;lion, a lower de&#xAD;cline than for the com&#xAD;pany&#x2019;s gate&#xAD;way ser&#xAD;vice seg&#xAD;ment, due to a con&#xAD;sol&#xAD;i&#xAD;da&#xAD;tion of new en&#xAD;ti&#xAD;ties that boosted rev&#xAD;enue.</p>
