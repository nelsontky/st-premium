    <p>NEW DELHI • As win­ter sets in, the air hang­ing over north­ern In­dia thick­ens with smoke from burn­ing fields, block­ing out the sun and mak­ing it hard to breathe. This year, that could spell disas­ter for the coun­try’s bat­tle against the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>With some of the most pol­luted cities on the planet and more than eight mil­lion con­firmed Covid-19 cases, In­dia is bat­tling a med­i­cal calamity.</p>
    <p>Tem­per­a­tures are fall­ing and coro­n­avirus cases and air pol­lu­tion are spik­ing across ma­jor cities, in­clud­ing the cap­i­tal New Delhi, one of the worst-af­fected ar­eas for smog from ru­ral burn­ing.</p>
    <p>Delhi’s 28 mil­lion peo­ple have not had a sin­gle day of clean air since early Septem­ber, based on the World Air Qual­ity In­dex.</p>
    <p>In the past two weeks, read­ings for par­tic­u­late mat­ter of 2.5 mi­crons or smaller, or PM2.5, have risen to more than 400 in some parts of Delhi – eight times the safe level.</p>
    <p>PM2.5 is closely watched be­cause the par­ti­cles are small enough to jour­ney deep into the lungs and do the most dam­age.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 and air pol­lu­tion are a dan­ger­ous com­bi­na­tion,” said Pro­fes­sor K. Sri­nath Reddy, pres­i­dent of the Public Health Foun­da­tion of In­dia. Air pol­lu­tion causes dam­age and in­flam­ma­tion in the lungs and other body tis­sues, re­duc­ing the body’s abil­ity to re­sist the virus, which may re­sult in more se­vere forms of the in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>With pol­lu­tion and the virus both at­tack­ing lungs, In­dia’s creak­ing healthcare sys­tem may come un­der a dou­ble strain of pa­tients com­pet­ing for the same re­sources. A rise in res­pi­ra­tory ill­nesses due to air pol­lu­tion will send more peo­ple to hos­pi­tals with symp­toms sim­i­lar to Covid-19, mak­ing iden­ti­fy­ing and iso­lat­ing the virus cases dif­fi­cult, said Delhi-based pul­mo­nolo­gist Pankaj Sayal.</p>
    <p>While of­fi­cial data showed the coun­try has seen a peak in in­fec­tion num­bers, a gov­ern­ment panel of sci­en­tists at­trib­uted the re­cent slow­down to a harsh na­tional lock­down ear­lier this year. They warned that the up­com­ing fes­ti­val and win­ter sea­sons may raise the sus­cep­ti­bil­ity to in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion es­ti­mates that dirty air kills seven mil­lion peo­ple a year glob­ally, with even short-term ex­po­sure caus­ing or ag­gra­vat­ing dis­eases in­clud­ing re­duced lung func­tion, asthma and, most im­por­tantly now, res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>“Now if I get Covid-19, I have less of a mar­gin,” said Delhi-based ad­vo­cate Meet Mal­ho­tra, 58, who de­vel­oped asthma as a child. “If your oxy­gen level goes un­der 90, you need hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion. What hap­pens if you’re al­ready at 92-93 be­cause of air pol­lu­tion?”</p>
    <p>Through­out the year, ve­hi­cle and in­dus­trial emis­sions con­trib­ute to In­dia’s poor air, com­bin­ing with dust from road con­struc­tion and mil­lions of do­mes­tic fires lit by poor cit­i­zens for cook­ing.</p>
    <p>But an ex­tra wal­lop comes late in the year as farm­ers burn hun­dreds of thou­sands of hectares of crop stub­ble. The prac­tice has been banned in some places but it is still the cheap­est and fastest way to clear the ground for the new crop.</p>
    <p>Bounded by moun­tains and hills, north­ern In­dia’s cold win­ter air traps the smoke for weeks.</p>
    <p>That could make it eas­ier for the coro­n­avirus to be trans­mit­ted, said Pro­fes­sor Arun Sharma at the Univer­sity Col­lege of Med­i­cal Sciences in Delhi. The risk of trans</p>
    <p>mis­sion of in­fec­tion will be higher as more par­ti­cles in the air give the virus more ways to travel from an in­fected per­son, he said.</p>
    <p>An En­vi­ron­ment Min­istry spokesman said the gov­ern­ment had in­tro­duced a new law to es­tab­lish a panel to tackle poor air qual­ity.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials from the Cen­tral Pol­lu­tion Con­trol Board had been di­vided into 50 teams to curb pol­lu­tion, while a pi­lot project was un­der way to de­com­pose rather than burn residue after the har­vest.</p>
    <p>Ev­i­dence has been mount­ing since March that air pol­lu­tion wors­ens the ef­fects of the coro­n­avirus, in­clud­ing a Har­vard study showing that Covid-19 death rates are higher in pol­luted ar­eas, and stud­ies link­ing mor­tal­ity and pol­lu­tants in China and Europe.</p>
    <p>Even for those who are try­ing to over­come the virus, the air qual­ity can slow or even pre­vent the chance of a full re­cov­ery in a small num­ber of cases.</p>
    <p>Lung func­tions in some peo­ple who were in in­ten­sive care are not re­turn­ing to nor­mal, said Dr Arvind Ku­mar, who started the Delhi-based Lung Care Foun­da­tion. Some pa­tients con­tinue to need oxy­gen. Oth­ers de­velop prob­lems such as fi­bro­sis and breath­less­ness.</p>
