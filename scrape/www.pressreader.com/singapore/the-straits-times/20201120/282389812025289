    <p>• Play­ing the Aus­tralian Open with no prepa­ra­tion time would be “very dan­ger­ous”, Brazil­ian dou­bles spe­cial­ist Bruno Soares warned af­ter lead-up events to the Grand Slam were thrown into fur­ther doubt.</p>
    <p>The stark mes­sage came af­ter Aus­tralian tennis chiefs flagged “new chal­lenges” around the ar­rival of play­ers during the coro­n­avirus pandemic.</p>
    <p>In cor­re­spon­dence with play­ers, the ATP said ar­rivals orig­i­nally planned for next month were now un­cer­tain. With play­ers fac­ing a 14-day quar­an­tine, any de­lay could make it dif­fi­cult to hold the high-pro­file ATP Cup and other tour­na­ments be­fore the Aus­tralian Open starts in Mel­bourne on Jan 18.</p>
    <p>It is also un­clear whether play­ers will be al­lowed to train during quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Soares, play­ing in the dou­bles event at the ATP Fi­nals in Lon­don this week, said it would be tough to play with no prac­tice.</p>
    <p>“If we have to quar­an­tine for 14 days in­side a room and then go play a Grand Slam, I mean, I will do it be­cause it’s my job and I have to find a way,” said the ATP Player Coun­cil mem­ber.</p>
    <p>“But I think it’s quite dan­ger­ous for the play­ers with no prepa­ra­tion I think to go there and com­pete right away. I think it’s phys­i­cally very dan­ger­ous.”</p>
    <p>World No. 7 Alexan­der Zverev said he was also con­cerned.</p>
    <p>“If we can’t even prac­tise for 14 days and we have to go out to play the Aus­tralian Open, it’s a lot­tery,” the Ger­man said. “I mean, you can ba­si­cally flip a coin who wins.”</p>
    <p>Tennis Aus­tralia on Mon­day flagged plans to move warm-up events from across Aus­tralia to the state of Vic­to­ria. But Vic­to­ria</p>
    <p>Pre­mier Daniel An­drews said that was “not a done deal” since Mel­bourne emerged from a month­long lock­down re­cently.</p>
    <p>Reign­ing Aus­tralian Open cham­pion No­vak Djokovic said he un­der­stood there were sev­eral op­tions on the table and he would be pre­pared for the Grand Slam tour­na­ment to be pushed back a week.</p>
    <p>“I hope that there is going to be sup­port and un­der­stand­ing from the Vic­to­rian and Aus­tralian gov­ern­ments for the play­ers and for Tennis Aus­tralia and that they will al­low play­ers to com­pete in the sec­ond week of quar­an­tine,” said the Serb.</p>
    <p>“You will be able to have at least a tour­na­ment or two prior to the Aus­tralian Open, which for ma­jor­ity of the play­ers is im­por­tant.”</p>
    <p>A TOSS-UP</p>
    <p>If we can’t even prac­tise for 14 days and we have to go out to play the Aus­tralian Open, it’s a lot­tery. I mean, you can ba­si­cally flip a coin who wins.</p>
    <p>ALEXAN­DER ZVEREV, Ger­man world No. 7, raises con­cern of play­ers not be­ing able to prac­tise during quar­an­tine be­fore the first Grand Slam next year.</p>
