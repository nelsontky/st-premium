    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Congress has passed the sec­ond-big­gest eco­nomic res­cue pack­age in US his­tory as part of a mas­sive year-end spend­ing Bill, con­clud­ing months of dis­cord between Democrats and Repub­li­cans over how to ad­dress the pan­demic that con­tin­ues to surge across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The US$900 bil­lion (S$1.2 tril­lion) relief pack­age passed on Mon­day is part of a US$2.3 tril­lion “coro­nabus” Bill that in­cludes a so­called om­nibus Bill to fund the gov­ern­ment for the com­ing year.</p>
    <p>The White House has said Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump will sign it.</p>
    <p>The deal will spare mil­lions of job­less work­ers who were days away from see­ing their un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits ex­pire, and pro­vide a new round of cash pay­outs.</p>
    <p>Small busi­nesses will ben­e­fit from more gov­ern­ment grants, while the pack­age also in­cludes rental as­sis­tance and help for fam­i­lies fac­ing evic­tion.</p>
    <p>“It’s a good bi­par­ti­san deal,” Demo­cratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Mon­day. “We will do some good with this leg­is­la­tion.”</p>
    <p>But “as Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Biden has said, it’s a first step, and we will need to do more. More to get virus as­sis­tance to crush the virus. More money to buy vac­cines”, Ms Pelosi said on the House floor.</p>
    <p>“I ap­plaud this relief pack­age, but our work is far from over,” Mr Biden said on Twit­ter. “Start­ing in the new year, Congress will need to im­me­di­ately get to work on sup­port for our Covid-19 plan.”</p>
    <p>The pan­demic aid pack­age will in­clud­ing one-time US$600 cheques for most Amer­i­cans, ex­tended un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits of US$300 a week and US$284 bil­lion more for a pay cheque pro­tec­tion pro­gramme for small busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steven Mnuchin said the US$600 cheques will go out as early as next week.</p>
    <p>That amounts to “US$2,400 for a fam­ily of four, so much needed relief just in time for the hol­i­days”, he told CNBC on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mists say the aid should be enough to avert a dou­ble-dip re­ces­sion next year, though risks re­main, and both po­lit­i­cal par­ties ex­pect to be wran­gling over ad­di­tional relief mea­sures af­ter Mr Biden takes of­fice on Jan 20.</p>
    <p>The relief plan is at­tached to a US$1.4 tril­lion Bill that would fund the fed­eral gov­ern­ment up to the end of the fis­cal year next Sept 30.</p>
    <p>That Bill ad­heres to budget caps set dur­ing last year’s debt ceil­ing fight, in­clud­ing by keep­ing US$12.5 bil­lion in spend­ing on war veter­ans’ health un­der the cap.</p>
    <p>The Bill also has US$1.4 bil­lion for Mr Trump’s bor­der wall and re­lated spend­ing, although the in­com­ing Biden ad­min­is­tra­tion could stop con­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>It also in­cludes an ex­ten­sion of tax breaks – for the al­co­hol and re­new­able en­ergy in­dus­tries, among oth­ers – a law to curb sur­prise med­i­cal bills, a wa­ter in­fra­struc­ture mea­sure and an in­tel­li­gence agency pol­icy Bill, among other pro­vi­sions.</p>
    <p>And it i ncludes money for schools, air­lines and dis­tri­bu­tion of vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Law­mak­ers from both par­ties com­plained about hav­ing to vote on such a sprawl­ing piece of leg­is­la­tion with so lit­tle time to di­gest the con­tents.</p>
    <p>“Who in their right mind thinks that this a re­spon­si­ble way of gov­ern­ing?” Repub­li­can Sen­a­tor Rick Scott of Florida said in a state­ment be­fore vot­ing against the Bill.</p>
    <p>Crit­i­cal to up­com­ing leg­is­la­tion will be whether Democrats man­age to win the two Georgia run-off elec­tions for the Se­nate on Jan 5 – giv­ing them con­trol of both cham­bers of Congress.</p>
