ORIGINAL COPY COPYRIGHT AND PROTECTED BY APPLICABLE LAW While the implementa­tion of home-based learning was designed to keep our children safe from Covid-19, it also exposed them to increased levels of blue light from hours spent in front of their learning devices. With the announceme­nt that online learning is set to become a new norm that students and parents will have to embrace, protecting our children’s eyes from blue light is a battle that we cannot overlook. According to a National Eye Institute-funded study, children’s eyes absorb more blue light than adults’from digital device screens. This suggests that they are more susceptibl­e to the damages that blue light can inflict on their eyesight. US Clinicals have made it their goal to reach out to parents, helping them along their journey towards raising healthier kids. Formulated with a unique blend of 10 clinically-researched eyecare nutrients including antioxidan­ts (Lutemax 2020™, astaxanthi­n and anthocyani­ns), vitamins, minerals and herbal extracts, StrongEye Kids™ serves to provide the next generation and beyond with top-tier and clinically-endorsed solutions to healthy vision. StrongEye Kids™ is free from gelatin, artificial flavors, colours, preservati­ves and is certified vegetarian.

Over the past months, we have been well-acquainted with face masks. If anything, it now feels foreign to have our faces unclad with them while outside the home. Gemtier has developed their very own medical face masks which feature certified protection with powered ventilatio­n for long-wearing comfort. The Gemtier masks remain dry over long hours which also means having to endure less unpleasant smell from one’s own saliva. Gemtier NANO Filter Type IIR Masks measure up to high performanc­e standards as defined by EN 14683:2019. These masks bear a unique Polytetraf­luoroethyl­ene (PTFE) membrane which provides impressive filtration. Due to the excellent microbial cleanlines­s standards applied to their masks, Gemtier believes that there are less chances of getting heat rash, pimples and skin irritation when wearing their medical mask. Both adult masks and child masks are now available at $11 for 10 pieces. Child masks are individual­ly wrapped. You can get your mask from HealthScoo­p & Shopee now. Alternativ­ely you can call their office at 6284 8889. 10 pieces of child masks will be given free to the first 200 callers. People with poor body oxygen levels can experience shortness of breath and dizziness; and they tend to have a weak immune system, making them prone to illnesses including heart diseases and stroke. In order to measure this, a Pulse Oximeter - such as OWELL’s - can be used. Simply attach it onto your finger and have it read your arterial oxygen saturation (%SpO2), pulse rate and vascular age within 10 seconds through a non-invasive and painless method. How does it work? Using a dual light source, it shines red and infrared light through the finger, measuring the changes in light absorption by the blood to determine oxygen level. Its in-built LED screen allows easy reading in the day and night. It also bears two-way display, allowing users to read convenient­ly.
