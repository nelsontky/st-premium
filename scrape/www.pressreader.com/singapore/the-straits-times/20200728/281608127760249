    <p>Moves by sov­er­eign wealth fund GIC to shore up its de­fences over re­cent years have helped it weather storms in global fi­nan­cial mar­kets but it still took some hits.</p>
    <p>The fund recorded an an­nu­alised rolling 20-year real rate of re­turn of 2.7 per cent for the 12 months to March 31 – higher than global in­fla­tion but be­low the 3.4 per cent racked up in the pre­vi­ous fi­nan­cial year. This de­cline is in part due to the way GIC cal­cu­lates its rate of re­turn.</p>
    <p>The fund mea­sures its per­for­mance by eval­u­at­ing it over a 20-year pe­riod, which started in 2001 for the fi­nan­cial year just ended.</p>
    <p>That marked a sig­nif­i­cant change as it meant the 12 months to March 31, 2000 – a boom pe­riod for tech­nol­ogy shares – no longer fig­ured in the cal­cu­la­tion.</p>
    <p>GIC chief ex­ec­u­tive Lim Chow Kiat noted that the lower rate of re­turn for the lat­est fi­nan­cial year was largely due to the drop­ping out of a “very strong tech-bub­ble year re­turn 21 years ago, rather than the re­cent mar­ket moves”.</p>
    <p>The real re­turn over the last fis­cal year is also the low­est since 2008/2009 – the pe­riod of the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis – when it was 2.6 per cent. GIC said its de­ci­sion to take a more de­fen­sive stance go­ing into the last fi­nan­cial year in the light of the in­creas­ingly risky global econ­omy had also helped cush­ion the im­pact from the fall in eq­uity mar­kets across the world in the first quar­ter of this year.</p>
    <p>The strat­egy in­volved in­creas­ing the pro­por­tion of lower-risk as­sets in its port­fo­lio with bonds and cash com­pris­ing 44 per cent as at March 31, its high­est since it adopted its lat­est in­vest­ment frame­work in 2013 and a 5 per­cent­age point in­crease from the pre­vi­ous year.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the al­lo­ca­tion to de­vel­oped and emerg­ing mar­ket equities fell in line with the de­cline in global share mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim told yes­ter­day’s briefing: “I do think go­ing for­ward, we have to be more dif­fer­en­ti­at­ing across coun­tries, across sec­tors, across com­pa­nies, be­cause the dis­per­sion is likely to be very wide, and that if you find your­self hold­ing as­sets which are... at the los­ing end, you may suf­fer per­ma­nent im­pair­ment.</p>
    <p>“I think the need to recog­nise these di­ver­gences, dis­per­sion, is go­ing to be much greater, which means in terms of in­vest­ment ap­proach, we have to go deeper, we have to be more bot­tom-up.”</p>
    <p>Group chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer Jef­frey Jaen­sub­hakij noted that it has to con­sider which coun­tries still have bonds with pos­i­tive yields, and whether they have poli­cies in place that will sus­tain those yields and shore up their cur­ren­cies.</p>
    <p>GIC is also eval­u­at­ing which coun­tries are likely to have the mon­e­tary and fis­cal poli­cies to gen­er­ate do­mes­tic growth with­out hav­ing to de­pend on global trade pick­ing up while oth­ers may need to bor­row in or­der to fund in­vest­ment or growth in the cur­rent en­vi­ron­ment, he said.</p>
    <p>There was lit­tle change in the fund’s ge­o­graph­i­cal mix over the year, with the United States ac­count­ing for more than one-third of as­sets, and Asia about 32 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim said that GIC does not ex­pect the pro­por­tion al­lo­cated to the US to change much: “We still see a lot of good prospects in that area.</p>
    <p>“I think what we would be more con­cerned about would be ac­tu­ally a num­ber of the emerg­ing mar­ket coun­tries, and we are mon­i­tor­ing closely how they are deal­ing with (is­sues), es­pe­cially this health­care cri­sis.”</p>
    <p>GIC ex­pects its ex­po­sure to Asia will rise in the longer term, en­abling it to ride on its trend of growth, Mr Lim said.</p>
    <p>Although specif­i­cally when this ex­po­sure in­creases “de­pends very much on those en­ter­prises”, he added.</p>
    <p>GIC noted in its re­port that it ex­pects Asia will gen­er­ate growth over the long term from ur­ban­i­sa­tion, ris­ing in­come among the mid­dle class, in­vest­ments in in­fra­struc­ture and hu­man cap­i­tal, and deeper re­gional in­te­gra­tion of economies and cap­i­tal mar­kets.</p>
    <p>The fund’s in­vest­ments in Asia over the past year in­cluded a US$500 mil­lion (S$690 mil­lion) joint ven­ture with lo­gis­tics real es­tate de­vel­oper ESR Cay­man to develop fa­cil­i­ties in China and a 20 per cent stake in Myan­mar’s Yoma Bank.</p>
    <p>Health­care and tech­nol­ogy firms have be­come in­vestor favourites lately but GIC also sees op­por­tu­ni­ties in other sec­tors – only at the right price, how­ever.</p>
    <p>As­set val­u­a­tion has be­come ever more crit­i­cal, given the way prices are mov­ing amid the pan­demic, chief ex­ec­u­tive Lim Chow Kiat said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>At a briefing ahead of the re­lease of the sov­er­eign wealth fund’s an­nual re­port, he said: “In­vest­ing is not just about knowing what sec­tor will do well or what com­pany do well, that is of course very im­por­tant, but it’s also im­por­tant to be dis­ci­plined about the price you pay for that.”</p>
    <p>Val­u­a­tions of com­pa­nies in sec­tors like health­care and tech­nol­ogy have gone up sub­stan­tially, he added.</p>
    <p>While GIC has in­vest­ments that have ben­e­fited from this trend, Mr Lim said the fund is care­ful about how it de­ploys more cap­i­tal in these ar­eas.</p>
    <p>He noted that there are other sec­tors which present good op­por­tu­ni­ties, with “com­pa­nies which are able to re­spond to change and have a suf­fi­cient bal­ance sheet to do so”, such as the con­sumer, in­fra­struc­ture and en­ergy in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>Group chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer Jef­frey Jaen­sub­hakij told the briefing that GIC is mon­i­tor­ing sec­tors where val­u­a­tions have yet to ad­just although it was able to in­vest in some con­sumer-ori­ented com­pa­nies ear­lier this year when prices fell.</p>
    <p>“I think we have to be a bit more care­ful in try­ing to fig­ure out what are truly long-term ad­just­ments that these com­pa­nies can never come back or won’t come back from quite as well, ver­sus ones where... you can ac­tu­ally see a nice come­back (in two to three years).”</p>
    <p>Be­sides health­care and tech­nol­ogy, there are other sec­tors that are also “ad­van­taged” by the changes that Covid-19 has brought on, Dr Jaen­sub­hakij said, not­ing that GIC has made ma­jor in­vest­ment moves in two real es­tate seg­ments – data cen­tres and lo­gis­tics.</p>
    <p>In April, it en­tered a joint ven­ture worth more than US$1 bil­lion (S$1.38 bil­lion) with Equinix to build three data cen­tres in Ja­pan for the cloud com­put­ing mar­ket.</p>
    <p>And it signed a deal last De­cem­ber to buy a port­fo­lio of lo­gis­tics prop­er­ties in Europe for about €950 mil­lion (S$1.5 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>GIC noted in an ar­ti­cle along­side its an­nual re­port that in­dus­try con­sol­i­da­tion is likely to in­crease, given the way the Covid-19 cri­sis has dras­ti­cally weak­ened the fi­nances of many com­pa­nies, par­tic­u­larly smallto medium-sized ones.</p>
    <p>Many firms will be forced to file for bank­ruptcy, se­cure ad­di­tional fund­ing or to seek merg­ers or other strate­gic al­ter­na­tives, it said.</p>
    <p>GIC also noted that pri­vate eq­uity cash re­serves reached record highs this year, pro­vid­ing fur­ther sup­port for in­dus­try con­sol­i­da­tion.</p>
    <p>But it pointed as well to chal­lenges ahead for glob­al­i­sa­tion and Asia amid the pan­demic, with com­pa­nies likely to look to di­ver­sify their pro­duc­tion ge­o­graph­i­cally or bring it closer to home.</p>
    <p>GIC cited a sur­vey which found that close to 60 per cent of firms were plan­ning to move man­u­fac­tur­ing pro­cesses out of China in the near fu­ture com­pared with 36 per cent in De­cem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>While some of this will bring pro­duc­tion back to home mar­kets, many com­pa­nies are turn­ing to other Asian economies like Tai­wan, In­dia and South-east Asia as al­ter­na­tives.</p>
    <p>But it will take a long time for firms to move out of China, given its ad­van­tages such as sup­ply chains and its fac­tory net­work, Dr Jaen­sub­hakij noted, adding that only Tai­wan and South Korea have sim­i­lar ca­pac­ity in terms of tech­nol­ogy ca­pa­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia and Viet­nam are two coun­tries GIC has its eye on in terms of lower-cost man­u­fac­tur­ing that could move out of China, he said.</p>
    <p>“We are cer­tainly look­ing at both do­mes­tic in­dus­tries, as well as in­fra­struc­ture and sup­port­ing in­dus­tries in those two coun­tries.”</p>
    <p>DIS­CI­PLINE IM­POR­TANT TOO</p>
    <p>In­vest­ing is not just about knowing what sec­tor will do well or what com­pany do well, that is of course very im­por­tant, but it’s also im­por­tant to be dis­ci­plined about the price you pay for that.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
