    <p>BEI­JING • An ex­per­i­men­tal green hous­ing pro­ject in a Chi­nese mega city promised prospec­tive res­i­dents life in a “ver­ti­cal for­est”, with man­i­cured gar­dens on ev­ery bal­cony.</p>
    <p>All 826 apart­ments were sold by April this year, ac­cord­ing to the pro­ject’s es­tate agent.</p>
    <p>But in­stead of a mod­ern eco­par­adise, the eight tow­ers look like the set of a des­o­late, post-apoc­a­lyp­tic movie.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem? Mos­qui­toes love the plants too.</p>
    <p>Due to an in­fes­ta­tion, only a hand­ful of fam­i­lies have moved into Chengdu’s Qiyi City For­est Gar­den, state me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>The pro­ject was built in 2018, with ev­ery bal­cony de­signed with space for plants to grow, ac­cord­ing to me­dia re­ports. With few ten­ants to care for them, the tow­ers were over­run by the plants – and in­vaded by mos­qui­toes.</p>
    <p>Plants have al­most swal­lowed up some ne­glected bal­conies, with branches hang­ing over rail­ings, footage shot this month showed.</p>
    <p>Pa­per was seen taped over some of the win­dows that were still vis­i­ble be­hind the over­grown plants.</p>
    <p>But some res­i­dents ap­peared to have braved the mos­qui­toes – a hand­ful of bal­conies had pruned plants and there were out­door fur­ni­ture and lights turned on in­side the apart­ments.</p>
    <p>Only about 10 fam­i­lies have moved in, ac­cord­ing to the staterun Global Times news­pa­per.</p>
