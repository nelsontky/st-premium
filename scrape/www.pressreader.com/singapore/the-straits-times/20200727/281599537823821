    <p>It is rare for screen adap­ta­tions to sat­isfy fans of the source ma­te­rial, but Net­flix’s The Baby-Sit­ters Club – based on the binge-able books of the same name – has been largely em­braced by view­ers and crit­ics, many of whom read the nov­els grow­ing up. The books may have been pub­lished decades ago, but they were mod­ern and in­clu­sive for their time and their themes are still re­lat­able to­day.</p>
    <p>It is rare for screen adap­ta­tions to sat­isfy fans of the source ma­te­rial, but Net­flix’s The Baby-Sit­ters Club – based on the binge-able books of the same name – has been largely em­braced by view­ers and crit­ics, many of whom read the nov­els grow­ing up.</p>
    <p>Pub­lished in the 1980s and 1990s and with more than 170 mil­lion copies sold, th­ese com­ing-of-age tales by Ann M. Martin fol­lowed a group of en­ter­pris­ing pre-teen girls as they launch a babysit­ting ser­vice to earn some ex­tra pocket money.</p>
    <p>Each writ­ten from one char­ac­ter’s point of view, the books dealt with the usual tri­als and tribu­la­tions of friend­ship and school.</p>
    <p>But they left an im­pres­sion be­cause they also tack­led un­usu­ally se­ri­ous themes for chil­dren’s sto­ries, in­clud­ing cop­ing with death, di­vorce and health prob­lems.</p>
    <p>And they were among the few Western chil­dren’s books to promi­nently fea­ture an Asian char­ac­ter, the artis­tic and stylish Clau­dia Kishi.</p>
    <p>A newly re­leased doc­u­men­tary on Net­flix, The Clau­dia Kishi Club, even de­tails the char­ac­ter’s in­flu­ence on a gen­er­a­tion of Asian-Amer­i­can artists and in­tel­lec­tu­als.</p>
    <p>In an e-mail in­ter­view, Momona Ta­mada, who plays Clau­dia in The Baby-Sit­ters Club se­ries, tells The Straits Times it means a lot to see some­one with the same back­ground as her in a book or tele­vi­sion show.</p>
    <p>“I read some of the orig­i­nal books when I was in el­e­men­tary school and loved them, and Clau­dia was special to me from the get-go be­cause she was Ja­panese-Amer­i­can.</p>
    <p>“As a Ja­panese-Cana­dian my­self, I thought it was so cool that some­one like me was in the book,” says the 13-year-old, who ap­peared in the ro­man­tic com­edy To All The Boys: P.S. I Still Love You ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>The se­ries – which co-stars Ali­cia Silverston­e (Clue­less, 1995) as one of the girls’ par­ents – ex­plores Clau­dia’s fam­ily his­tory, which she learns about through an un­ex­pected in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>“Play­ing Clau­dia in this scene, I felt the im­por­tance of know­ing about your­self, your fam­ily and his­tory, be­cause those pieces of knowl­edge build your own iden­tity.”</p>
    <p>And while the show has nos­tal­gic ap­peal for fans of the books, th­ese sto­ries are still rel­e­vant to kids to­day, she feels.</p>
    <p>“The cre­ators and writ­ers of the show did an amaz­ing job of mod­ernising the books. The main thing is re­lata­bil­ity: The Baby-Sit­ters</p>
    <p>Club girls all face ob­sta­cles that many pre-teens and teens ex­pe­ri­ence in their real lives.</p>
    <p>“They’re just like me and you. They all have dif­fer­ent back­grounds, good and bad days, and their strug­gles are just like ours.</p>
    <p>“At the same time, they in­spire and teach us about en­trepreneur­ship and friend­ship. I love how they all help each other and grow to­gether,” Momona says.</p>
    <p>The show’s creator, Rachel Shuk­ert, was a fan of the books when she was young and in­stinc­tively un­der­stands their en­dur­ing ap­peal.</p>
    <p>“I was ob­sessed with them, all my friends were as well. We used to trade them with one another and, some­times, I could read three or four of them in a sin­gle day,” the 40-year-old re­calls.</p>
    <p>Shuk­ert, whose writ­ing cred­its in­clude the dra­mas Glow (2017 to 2019) and Su­per­girl (2015 to 2016), made the source ma­te­rial feel more con­tem­po­rary.</p>
    <p>“We had to up­date tech­nol­ogy and things like that, and also find ways for the town of Stoney­brook to feel more like the world we live in now in terms of di­ver­sity and in­clu­sion,” she says. “But the books were very mod­ern and in­clu­sive for their time, so I felt like I just wanted to nudge them for­ward in an or­ganic way.”</p>
    <p>At its core, how­ever, The BabySit­ters Club story re­mains the same.</p>
    <p>“Many of the cir­cum­stances sur­round­ing be­ing a kid have changed since the 1980s, but the es­sen­tial ex­pe­ri­ence of be­ing a kid has not re­ally changed that much,” Shuk­ert says.</p>
    <p>“Friends are still su­per im­por­tant and you’re still fig­ur­ing out who you are in the world, how to be a good per­son, how to ap­proach some­body you have a crush on or what to wear that matches how you feel inside.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese ex­pe­ri­ences are still uni­ver­sal.”</p>
