    <p>WASH­ING­TON The US gov­ern­ment has said it would raise tar­iffs on cer­tain Euro­pean Union prod­ucts, in­clud­ing air­craft com­po­nents and wines from France and Ger­many, the l at­est twist i n a 16-year bat­tle over air­craft sub­si­dies be­tween Wash­ing­ton and Brus­sels.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Wed­nes­day, the Of­fice of the US Trade Rep­re­sen­ta­tive ( USTR) said it was adding tar­iffs on air­craft man­u­fac­tur­ing parts and cer­tain non­sparkling wines as well as co­gnacs and other brandies from France and Ger­many.</p>
    <p>The USTR did not say when the tar­iffs would take ef­fect but noted that ad­di­tional details would be “forth­com­ing.” The US ac­tion comes as US and Euro­pean ne­go­tia­tors con­tinue talks on end­ing the long-run­ning dis­pute over gov­ern­ment aid to Europe’s Air­bus, which is po­lit­i­cally backed by Bri­tain,</p>
    <p>France, Ger­many and Spain, and US aid plane maker Boe­ing.</p>
    <p>The USTR said on Wed­nes­day the EU had un­fairly cal­cu­lated tar­iffs against the United States al­lowed by a Septem­ber World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) rul­ing in the on­go­ing dis­pute. “The EU needs to take some mea­sure to com­pen­sate for this un­fair­ness,” it said.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tives for the Euro­pean Union and Air­bus could not be im­me­di­ately reached for com­ment on the USTR ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Ben An­eff, pres­i­dent of the US Wine Trade Al­liance, said the ac­tion would cause fur­ther hard­ship for US com­pa­nies al­ready hit hard by previous tar­iffs, and urged Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den to quickly re­verse course. “This ac­tion is a body blow for Amer­i­can com­pa­nies. US restau­rants and small busi­nesses are al­ready strug­gling to sur­vive; this de­ci­sion will only de­stroy more j obs and shut­ter more doors,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Emily Haber, Ger­many’s Am­bas­sador to the US, this month urged quick ac­tion to re­solve the dis­pute, call­ing it a dis­trac­tion from big­ger is­sues that re­quire joint ac­tion such as cli­mate change and the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The avi­a­tion feud is the long­est and most com­pli­cated ever han­dled by the WTO.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton quickly em­braced the op­por­tu­nity to im­pose US$7.5 bil­lion (S$9.9 bil­lion) in tar­iffs against Euro­peans af­ter be­ing cleared to do so by the WTO last year. It im­posed puni­tive tar­iffs of 25 per cent on prod­ucts such as wine, cheese and olive oil and put a 15 per­cent tar­iff on Air­bus planes in March. In re­tal­i­a­tion, the EU has been im­pos­ing cus­toms du­ties on US$4 bil­lion of Amer­i­can ex­ports since the be­gin­ning of Novem­ber.</p>
