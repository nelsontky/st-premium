    <p>It was 5am and baker Xavier Lee was 20 min­utes into mak­ing his first batch of cane­les for the day.</p>
    <p>His oven blew a fuse.</p>
    <p>The 31-year-old turned to YouTube and Red­dit for help, since there was no one he could call at that hour.</p>
    <p>“I swopped the fuse from my Ne­spresso ma­chine with the one in my oven,” he says. “Voila, it worked like magic. That felt like the long­est five min­utes of my life.”</p>
    <p>His cof­fee ma­chine, you will be pleased to know, is work­ing again.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee, who started Flour­crafts in April, sells pas­tries such as cane­les, scones and cakes packed in el­e­gant boxes that could have come from a smart pas­try shop. There is a card in the box, with a QR code that cus­tomers can scan to find out how best to en­joy the pas­tries.</p>
    <p>His story is one of mak­ing lemon­ade out of lemons, and of pur­su­ing his dream with courage.</p>
    <p>He was not al­ways a baker. He trained in ac­coun­tancy and spent a year work­ing as an au­di­tor be­fore de­cid­ing that was not some­thing he wanted to do for the rest of his life. Bak­ing was a hobby and his col­leagues used to call him “Baker Boy” be­cause he would take his cook­ies to work.</p>
    <p>He en­rolled i n an 18-month pas­try course at Le Cor­don Bleu in Syd­ney. In fact, he was due to re­turn there, as he had been of­fered a job as a pas­try chef.</p>
    <p>“Due to Covid-19, these plans did not work out. While I sent count­less re­sumes ev­ery­where, it is hard to land a job when most food busi­nesses are scal­ing back on hir­ing,” he says. “I could not sit around know­ing I was not con­tribut­ing to my fam­ily, so I had to do some­thing about it.”</p>
    <p>He set­tled on sell­ing cane­les, a vanilla and rum-flavoured French pas­try from Bordeaux, be­cause he wanted to sell “some­thing that is not our sta­ple”. Lots of peo­ple were sell­ing cook­ies, chif­fon cakes and the like.</p>
    <p>To make some­thing un­fa­mil­iar more fa­mil­iar, he made the lit­tle pas­tries with Asian flavours such as matcha, hou­jicha and Mao Shan</p>
    <p>Wang, us­ing cop­per moulds he or­dered from France.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple re­sponded en­thu­si­as­ti­cally, and he sells 25 to 30 pas­try tast­ing boxes a day.</p>
    <p>He is work­ing to ex­pand his of­fer­ings and has a few ideas for Na­tional Day-themed cane­les.</p>
    <p>“The best re­ward is when some­one texts me say­ing I touched his heart,” he says.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has taught me one thing. Things can be un­cer­tain, but you can’t just sit back and do noth­ing. Ev­ery­one is say­ing that this is a bad year. But you just have to tackle the un­cer­tainty, make the best of it.”</p>
