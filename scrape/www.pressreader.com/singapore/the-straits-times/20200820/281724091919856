    <p>NUM­BER OF FOR­EIGN UNI­VER­SITY STU­DENTS AL­LOWED TO RE­TURN TO AUS­TRALIA NEXT MONTH</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia plans to start al­low­ing for­eign stu­dents to re­turn from next month as part of a trial that will aim to re­boot the coun­try’s lu­cra­tive in­ter­na­tional ed­u­ca­tion sec­tor.</p>
    <p>The first batch of stu­dents will go to the state of South Aus­tralia, which has ef­fec­tively curbed its Covid-19 out­break. As of yes­ter­day, the state had recorded 23 cases since the be­gin­ning of June and had not had a lo­cally trans­mit­ted case in 13 days.</p>
    <p>The trial will in­volve fly­ing 300 uni­ver­sity stu­dents – re­port­edly mainly from China, Hong Kong, Ja­pan and Sin­ga­pore – from Sin­ga­pore to Ade­laide early next month.</p>
    <p>The stu­dents, like Aus­tralian cit­i­zens and res­i­dents ar­riv­ing from abroad, will un­dergo 14 days of quar­an­tine at a ho­tel, which will be paid for by the uni­ver­si­ties.</p>
    <p>Trade Min­is­ter Simon Birm­ing­ham said the trial was de­signed to test whether stu­dents could be brought to Aus­tralia safely, and would en­able a greater num­ber of en­rol­ments for the next aca­demic year.</p>
    <p>“This is a sec­tor that sup­ports thou­sands and thou­sands of jobs,” he told Ade­laide’s FiveAA Ra­dio on Mon­day. “So, if we can suc­cess­fully run a pi­lot… then we can look at how we might deal with things as we head into next year, par­tic­u­larly the start of uni next year.”</p>
    <p>South Aus­tralia’s Pre­mier, Mr Steven Mar­shall, said yes­ter­day that a fi­nal de­ci­sion had not yet been made about the ex­act date for the start of the trial or which coun­tries the stu­dents will come from.</p>
    <p>A pre­vi­ous plan last month to bring in­ter­na­tional stu­dents to Can­berra was post­poned due to the wors­en­ing Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>As of yes­ter­day, Aus­tralia had recorded 23,993 Covid-19 cases and 450 deaths. The coun­try was al­most free of the virus un­til a fresh out­break in Mel­bourne last month that spread to other re­gions and states.</p>
    <p>Mel­bourne is cur­rently un­der a strict six-week lock­down, in­clud­ing an 8pm to 5am cur­few, and case num­bers have be­gun to drop this week.</p>
    <p>The curbs on in­ter­na­tional travel in­tro­duced since the out­break have taken a dev­as­tat­ing toll on Aus­tralia’s in­ter­na­tional ed­u­ca­tion sec­tor, which was pre­vi­ously worth about A$40 bil­lion (S$39.5 bil­lion) a year.</p>
    <p>As of June, Aus­tralia had 637,415 for­eign stu­dents in the coun­try who were en­rolled at schools, uni­ver­si­ties and other ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions. Of these, 26 per cent were from China, 17 per cent from In­dia, 8 per cent from Nepal and 4 per cent from Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>But thou­sands of stu­dents were left stranded over­seas, un­able to re­sume or start their stud­ies be­cause of the travel ban, which is ex­pected to cost uni­ver­si­ties A$3 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The toll could worsen, es­pe­cially as govern­ment data has shown that for­eign stu­dent visa ap­pli­ca­tions have plunged in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>In the three months to the end of June, 45,155 peo­ple ap­plied for such visas, com­pared with 117,303 peo­ple in the same pe­riod last year – a drop of more than 60 per cent.</p>
    <p>Some uni­ver­si­ties have al­ready shed staff and scaled back other spend­ing, such as build­ing works.</p>
    <p>Mr Phil Honey­wood, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the In­ter­na­tional Ed­u­ca­tion As­so­ci­a­tion of Aus­tralia, which pro­motes the in­ter­na­tional ed­u­ca­tion sec­tor, wel­comed the trial in South Aus­tralia, say­ing he hoped it would lead to sim­i­lar moves in other states.</p>
    <p>“Con­grats to (South Aus­tralia) for be­ing first to an­nounce over­seas stu­dents to re­turn,” he said in a tweet. “Come on all you other states/ter­ri­to­ries with closed bor­ders – restart your vi­tal (in­ter­na­tional ed­u­ca­tion) in­dus­tries.”</p>
    <p>But the trial has prompted crit­i­cism, par­tic­u­larly from Aus­tralians from other states, who are cur­rently barred from en­ter­ing South Aus­tralia, as well as from Aus­tralians who have strug­gled to re­turn home from over­seas ow­ing to lim­ited seats on flights.</p>
    <p>Mr Birm­ing­ham said the in­ter­na­tional ed­u­ca­tion sec­tor was vi­tal to the Aus­tralian econ­omy and should be re­booted as soon as it was safe to do so.</p>
    <p>“This is a very im­por­tant next step in terms of the re­cov­ery from the eco­nomic dis­as­ter of Covid,” he said.</p>
    <p>The curbs on in­ter­na­tional travel in­tro­duced since the out­break of the pan­demic have taken a dev­as­tat­ing toll on Aus­tralia’s in­ter­na­tional ed­u­ca­tion sec­tor, which was pre­vi­ously worth about A$40 bil­lion (S$39.5 bil­lion) a year.</p>
