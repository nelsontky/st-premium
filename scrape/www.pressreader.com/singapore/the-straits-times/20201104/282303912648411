    <p>Never be­fore have gov­ern­ments cre­ated safety nets as wide and as deep as those they set up dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>From Ger­many to Ja­pan to Britain, a large chunk of fur­loughed work­ers’ wages have been paid for by the state. Com­pa­nies have been shored up with an ar­ray of debt-re­lief schemes.</p>
    <p>Yet, many gov­ern­ments are now also con­sid­er­ing their exit strat­egy, well aware that re­plac­ing in­comes in­def­i­nitely will be fis­cally ru­inous and will sti­fle the re­al­lo­ca­tion of labour to­wards vi­able sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Against this back­drop, ques­tions were raised in Par­lia­ment as to whether there is enough sup­port for lower-in­come work­ers here.</p>
    <p>They ben­e­fit from mea­sures such as the Work­fare In­come Sup­ple­ment (WIS) scheme, which is paid in the form of Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) top-ups and cash sup­ple­ments.</p>
    <p>The scheme was en­hanced this year by rais­ing the qual­i­fy­ing in­come cap to $2,300 per month, and the max­i­mum pay­out to $4,000 per year.</p>
    <p>In the House yes­ter­day, Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Pan­jang) asked for the break­down of WIS re­cip­i­ents and the scheme’s im­pact on em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Work­ers’ Party (WP) MP Ja­mus Lim (Sengkang GRC) wanted to know how many Sin­ga­pore­ans earned $1,300 or less in take-home pay each month, ex­clud­ing CPF con­tri­bu­tions and other in­come de­duc­tions.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Man­power Zaqy Mo­hamad’s re­sponse touched on why a holis­tic ap­proach is needed, and why it was not mean­ing­ful to pro­vide the num­ber re­quested by As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lim.</p>
    <p>First, he said, of the 30,000 full-time Sin­ga­porean work­ers earn­ing less than $1,300 a month, al­most half of them are aged 60 and above. Many are not the pri­mary bread­win­ners in their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>Other mea­sures in ad­di­tion to WIS help ad­dress their spe­cific needs: from ComCare, Sil­ver Sup­port and util­i­ties re­bates, to en­hanced hous­ing grants and fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance for school-go­ing chil­dren.</p>
    <p>His other point was that CPF and WIS pay­outs ought to be in­cluded when cal­cu­lat­ing some­one’s in­come, since WIS gives cash, and CPF can be used for hous­ing and healthcare.</p>
    <p>This is in line with in­ter­na­tional con­ven­tion, and min­i­mum wages, too, are typ­i­cally sub­ject to taxes and so­cial se­cu­rity con­tri­bu­tions.</p>
    <p>Turn­ing the ques­tion around, Mr Zaqy asked Prof Lim to clar­ify the level of min­i­mum wage that the WP stood for.</p>
    <p>Prof Lim replied that the premise of his ques­tion had noth­ing to do with the min­i­mum wage, which prompted Mr Zaqy to say he was evad­ing the ques­tion.</p>
    <p>Still, Mr Zaqy pressed him for con­fir­ma­tion on whether the WP, in hav­ing pro­posed a min­i­mum wage of $1,300, was re­fer­ring to gross in­come or take-home pay after de­duc­tions.</p>
    <p>Prof Lim said a gross pay of $1,300 was a “fair char­ac­ter­i­sa­tion” – but cor­rected him­self later, say­ing his party’s po­si­tion is for a min­i­mum take-home pay of $1,300 a month for full-time work.</p>
    <p>In its party man­i­festo, the WP called “for all work­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans to re­ceive a min­i­mum take-home wage of $1,300 per month for full-time work and pro-rated for part-time work”.</p>
    <p>The fre­quency with which such topics have been raised ap­peared to have worn some MPs’ pa­tience thin.</p>
    <p>As the dis­cus­sion moved to the</p>
    <p>Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS), Speaker Tan Chuan-Jin asked the WP’s Ger­ald Giam (Alju­nied GRC) to “keep it short”.</p>
    <p>Mr Giam obliged, sug­gest­ing that com­pa­nies should be means-tested for state sup­port, as some are do­ing well and do not need the JSS.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond Fi­nance Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said the JSS was de­signed to be a broad-based wage sup­port scheme and that un­em­ploy­ment rates to­day would be far higher were it not in force.</p>
    <p>That said, Mr Wong, who is also Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter, noted that the Gov­ern­ment has differenti­ated the sup­port by tiers and would con­tinue to re­view the scheme.</p>
    <p>On a re­lated note, Min­is­ter of State for Trade and In­dus­try Alvin Tan as­sured that there would be spe­cial ar­range­ments for se­niors to re­deem and use their dig­i­tal Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers vouch­ers, such as at phys­i­cal coun­ters at com­mu­nity cen­tres.</p>
    <p>The $320 mil­lion worth of vouch­ers – aimed at giv­ing lo­cal tourism busi­nesses a shot in the arm – will be dis­trib­uted via SingPass, and are meant to be spent on stay­ca­tions, tick­ets to leisure at­trac­tions and lo­cal tours.</p>
    <p>The Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers cam­paign – and a seven-month ex­ten­sion to the JSS – are key thrusts of the ex­tra help for the bat­tered tourism sec­tor, which now gets the high­est tier of wage sup­port at 75 per cent.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is not the first to use vouch­ers to shore up con­sumer spend­ing. Ja­pan’s Go To Travel cam­paign, for ex­am­ple, of­fers up to a 35 per cent dis­count on do­mes­tic trips.</p>
    <p>In China, lo­cal gov­ern­ments roped in e-com­merce plat­forms such as WeChat, Ali­pay and Meituan to is­sue coupons that can be used for movies, vis­its to tourist sites and to buy con­sumer goods.</p>
    <p>In­di­vid­ual schemes aside, the un­der­ly­ing chal­lenge is this: Gov­ern­ments are find­ing it in­creas­ingly costly to sub­sidise jobs and busi­nesses for which there is no de­mand.</p>
    <p>The im­pend­ing clo­sure of the 162-year-old Robin­sons de­part­ment store and the prospects of many of its long-serv­ing staff come to mind.</p>
    <p>The task now is to phase out blan­ket sub­si­dies, while still pro­tect­ing work­ers. This means heavy in­vest­ments in train­ing and place­ment, and striv­ing to cre­ate new jobs and the right hir­ing in­cen­tives.</p>
    <p>While the worst of the pan­demic ap­pears to be over, the tough­est days for the economy still lie ahead.</p>
