    <p>NEW YORK • The top seeds, in­clud­ing No­vak Djokovic, over­came eerily still stands as a “weird”, spectator-free US Open started on Mon­day with height­ened safety pro­to­cols for some play­ers fol­low­ing a pos­i­tive Covid-19 test.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral com­peti­tors were placed in what one of them de­scribed as a “bub­ble within a bub­ble” af­ter France’s Benoit Paire was with­drawn a day ear­lier af­ter be­ing in­fected by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“It was made clear that the in­fected player was not ad­her­ing to the health pro­to­cols that have been ap­proved by the State of New York,” a spokesman for the United States Ten­nis As­so­ci­a­tion (USTA) told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>A per­son fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said the 23rd-ranked Paire, who was sup­posed to be the 17th seed, had been lax about wear­ing a mask.</p>
    <p>World No. 1 Djokovic and top women’s seed and third-ranked Karolina Pliskova were among the big names to shrug off the deathly quiet at Flush­ing Meadows and progress to the se­cond round of the first Ma­jor of the Covid-19 era.</p>
    <p>Match-win­ning points went uncheered, ball per­sons wore masks, and play­ers had to reach for their own tow­els in a tightly con­trolled en­vi­ron­ment that made for an open­ing day Grand Slam un­like any other.</p>
    <p>Tow­els proved to be the big­gest bug­bear, with most used to ball kids hand­ing them the fab­ric un­der nor­mal cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>At the Western & South­ern Open last week, um­pires de­layed start­ing the 25-se­cond count­down clock be­fore a point to al­low play­ers to get back to their seats and have a quick wipe down, but those pro­to­cols were ab­sent at the US Open.</p>
    <p>Djokovic, who won that fi­nal warm-up event, was un­aware of the rule change and was seen re­mon­strat­ing with the um­pire dur­ing his 6-1, 6-4, 6-1 win over Bos­nian Damir Dzumhur.</p>
    <p>Call­ing it “not ac­cept­able and not fair”, the 17-time Slam win­ner said: “No one re­ally brought it to my at­ten­tion. That’s some­thing that re­ally up­set me.”</p>
    <p>World No. 6 Ste­fanos Tsit­si­pas of Greece was also un­happy at not get­ting reg­u­lar ac­cess to his towel, say­ing: “It has huge im­por­tance. It gives me time to think, to re­fresh my­self and think about my tac­tics.</p>
    <p>“Also, it’s not very com­fort­able play­ing all sweaty and hav­ing sweat drip from your face and get to your eyes.”</p>
    <p>The “strange” con­di­tions are even worse for the likes of Kristina Mlade­n­ovic. The French­woman, along with com­pa­tri­ots Richard Gas­quet, Adrian Man­nar­ino and Edouard Roger-Vas­selin have all been asked to ad­here to stricter safety mea­sures fol­low­ing Paire’s pull-out.</p>
    <p>The USTA has con­firmed that a num­ber of play­ers are now be­ing tested on a daily ba­sis, rather than every four days.</p>
    <p>The quar­tet are now al­lowed to leave their ho­tel room only to travel to the US Na­tional Ten­nis Cen­tre, whereas pre­vi­ously, they had been al­lowed in com­mu­nal ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Com­plain­ing about the en­hanced rules, 30th-seed Mlade­n­ovic, who beat Amer­i­can Hai­ley Bap­tiste 7-5, 6-2 to move into the se­cond round, said: “We got some bad news two days ago and since then, I’ve been liv­ing in a night­mare.”</p>
    <p>Paire was equally an­gered by his treat­ment, say­ing on his In­sta­gram page: “I’m fine for now, I have no symp­toms... I hes­i­tate to tell what is re­ally go­ing on in this ‘fake bub­ble’.”</p>
