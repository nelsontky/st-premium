    <p>An­jali Ragu­ra­man</p>
    <p>WHO Char­maine Thio, 29, spreads the aware­ness of gin as the re­gional brand am­bas­sador for Hen­drick’s Gin South-east Asia. Be­fore tak­ing on the role in 2018, she was at pi­o­neer­ing cock­tail bar 28 Hongkong Street, where she worked her way up from bar back to bar cap­tain over 31/2 years.</p>
    <p>Trav­el­ling is a big part of my job, but now that I’m not fly­ing around the re­gion for train­ing ses­sions or do­ing guest shifts at bars, I try to keep a reg­u­lar ex­er­cise sched­ule from Monday to Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Fri­day is my rest and re­cov­ery day. It’s a day when most peo­ple wind down, but it’s a work­day for me when I go out and visit bars to stay on top of things and see what they have been up to.</p>
    <p>In the next cou­ple of weeks, with the new­est Hen­drick’s Gin ex­pres­sion Mid­sum­mer Sol­stice be­ing launched, there are more than 50 bars com­ing up with their own cock­tails us­ing the flo­ral spirit. I’m look­ing for­ward to try­ing the dif­fer­ent cock­tail cre­ations but, per­son­ally, I think the new gin would be amaz­ing in a Cos­mopoli­tan.</p>
    <p>Over the past decade, be­tween univer­sity and work­ing in nightlife, I’ve not been much of a morn­ing per­son, so Satur­days are my one day to sleep in and in­dulge a bit.</p>
    <p>But it has also be­come my “long run” day, where I do runs rang­ing from 10km to 18km.</p>
    <p>It’s some­thing I got into dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, when runs were the only chance to get out of the house for fresh air.</p>
    <p>In the past, the thought of do­ing a half marathon was unimag­in­able, but I’m go­ing to try that when those start again.</p>
    <p>Sun­days are a bit of a wild card. Some­times, I do brunch with my mum and sis­ter and we have dim sum quite of­ten.</p>
    <p>When times were nor­mal, we would also go to the the­atre be­cause my fam­ily had sea­son tick­ets, or we would go for a big-name mu­si­cal at Ma­rina Bay Sands and make a night of it by get­ting dressed up and hav­ing pre-show cock­tails.</p>
    <p>Now, in the af­ter­noons, I usu­ally go for pole danc­ing classes. I used to be a cheer­leader and re­ally en­joy push­ing my body to do stunts, so I sup­pose pole danc­ing is the clos­est thing to that. It’s scratch­ing an old cheer­lead­ing itch.</p>
    <p>Be­cause the stu­dio is close to Keong Saik Road, I usu­ally pop in to No Sleep Club for a cof­fee be­fore or af­ter class.</p>
    <p>Sun­days are also typ­i­cally in­dus­try nights when most peo­ple are off. So that’s when</p>
    <p>I meet my in­dus­try friends and we visit the peo­ple who are still work­ing on the day at the likes of MO Bar and Heart of Dark­ness.</p>
