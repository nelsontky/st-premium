    <p>A project called Doc­u­ment­ing Covid-19 in Sin­ga­pore hopes to help pos­ter­ity bet­ter un­der­stand what it was like to live through this year and has been col­lect­ing sub­mis­sions of var­i­ous items. They ex­plore life here from many per­spec­tives, in­clud­ing pho­tos of panic buy­ing in the early months of the pan­demic, an empty Changi Airport (right) and “vir­tual par­ties” on video games.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of items, ac­counts and clips have been sub­mit­ted to the Na­tional Mu­seum and the Na­tional Li­brary Board that will show fu­ture gen­er­a­tions what life was like dur­ing the pan­demic</p>
    <p>Ms Anoo Manoj, 44, lost her fa­ther, who lives in In­dia, this year. She had to get spe­cial per­mis­sion to fly there from Sin­ga­pore to visit him in hospi­tal in Au­gust, and even then, was un­able to see him be­cause she had to be quar­an­tined.</p>
    <p>She would not see him be­fore her fam­ily de­cided to pull the plug on his life sup­port.</p>
    <p>“Sleep eludes me. Nights are ter­ri­fy­ing. What news will I wake up to...,” she writes.</p>
    <p>Her story is among nearly 4,000 pho­tos, nar­ra­tive ac­counts, videos, web­pages and items such as posters and de­signer masks that have been sub­mit­ted to the Na­tional Mu­seum and the Na­tional Li­brary Board (NLB).</p>
    <p>They are part of a project, Doc­u­ment­ing Covid-19 in Sin­ga­pore, that hopes to help fu­ture gen­er­a­tions bet­ter un­der­stand what it was like to live through 2020.</p>
    <p>As of yes­ter­day, there have been 58,529 con­firmed in­fec­tions in Sin­ga­pore and 29 deaths from Covid-19 compli­cations.</p>
    <p>Sub­mis­sions ex­plore life here from many per­spec­tives, in­clud­ing pho­tos of panic buy­ing in su­per­mar­kets in the early months of the pan­demic, an empty Changi Airport, and strangers gath­er­ing on­line to cel­e­brate spe­cial oc­ca­sions like the Na­tional Day.</p>
    <p>There were also pho­tos of in­ven­tions spe­cific to the pan­demic year, such as lounge wear with for­mal tops suit­able for Zoom of­fice meet­ings and face masks with built-in mi­cro­phones for lec­tur­ers, who wear them when speak­ing in their classes.</p>
    <p>Ms Huism Tan, the direc­tor of NLB and cov­er­ing direc­tor of the Na­tional Ar­chives of Sin­ga­pore, said there have been nearly 4,000 sub­mis­sions since the NLB and the Na­tional Mu­seum made the call in May.</p>
    <p>“When fu­ture gen­er­a­tions look back, they can get a sense of how Sin­ga­pore­ans have man­aged dur­ing this crisis,” she said. “They will be able to ac­cess this col­lec­tion decades later for re­search, to un­der­stand Sin­ga­pore’s his­tory.”</p>
    <p>A small se­lec­tion of the first batch of ob­jects and pho­to­graphs col­lected is be­ing ex­hib­ited at the Na­tional Mu­seum. More such ex­hi­bi­tions could be con­sid­ered in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>The NLB and the Na­tional Mu­seum said they are ex­tend­ing the dead­line for sub­mis­sion un­til June 30 next year, as Sin­ga­pore be­gins its tran­si­tion to Phase 3 of its re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>Phase 3 should bring with it dif­fer­ent ex­pe­ri­ences after the pe­riod of tighter re­stric­tions, Ms Tan said, for ex­am­ple, show­ing how peo­ple use their gov­ern­ment-given tourism dol­lars and how the pop­u­la­tion is grad­u­ally vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>The agen­cies have also been con­duct­ing and record­ing in­ter­views with peo­ple who have unique per­spec­tives and whose sto­ries de­serve to be told on video, such as a mi­grant worker who re­cov­ered from Covid-19 in a dor­mi­tory and a reli­gious teacher who has had to em­brace tech­nol­ogy to con­duct classes on­line.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA), one of the en­ti­ties most af­fected by the coro­n­avirus this year, said it de­cided to make its own sub­mis­sions as a show of re­silience.</p>
    <p>It has given to the agen­cies footage of its grounded planes, emails to af­fected cus­tomers, and pho­tos of its staff tak­ing on roles in health­care, trans­port and so­cial ser­vice.</p>
    <p>An SIA spokesman said: “While the Covid-19 pan­demic is one of the most dif­fi­cult pe­ri­ods in SIA’s his­tory, it has taught us many lessons.</p>
    <p>“We hope that peo­ple will see not just the chal­lenges that we faced, but also our re­silience in over­com­ing them, the spirit of our peo­ple, and our ef­forts to per­se­vere and re­cover from the crisis.”</p>
    <p>Sib­lings Ryan Tan, 10, and Zachary Tan, 12, sub­mit­ted a video of an on­line char­ity con­cert they or­gan­ised with 17 of their friends to raise money for fam­i­lies ad­versely af­fected by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Their ef­forts – both of them played the pi­ano – gar­nered over $7,000.</p>
    <p>They have also sub­mit­ted videos of their Zoom calls with their grand­par­ents in Malaysia as they ate din­ner at the same time to sim­u­late as far as pos­si­ble a real-life fam­ily gath­er­ing.</p>
    <p>Zachary ex­plained why he made the sub­mis­sion: “We want to show that we are not just sit­ting around do­ing noth­ing. The ef­fect of Covid-19 can be mit­i­gated with Zoom calls and spe­cial projects.</p>
    <p>We hope we can also in­spire fu­ture gen­er­a­tions.”</p>
