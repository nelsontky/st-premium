    <p>OR­LANDO • Bos­ton Celtics coach Brad Stevens could not be prouder of his play­ers af­ter they erased a half-time deficit with a Jayson Ta­tum-led third-quar­ter surge on Friday, stay­ing alive in the East­ern Con­fer­ence Fi­nals with a 121-108 vic­tory over the Mi­ami Heat.</p>
    <p>“We’re pride­ful,” he told ESPN af­ter the Celtics fought back to make it 3-2 in the best-of-seven Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) se­ries.</p>
    <p>“Our deal was to come out and play, come out and com­pete, give it our best shot and I thought we played pretty well in the sec­ond half.”</p>
    <p>Ta­tum fin­ished with a game-high 31 points, in­clud­ing 17 in the third quar­ter, when the third-seeded Celtics erupted for 41 points af­ter just 51 in the first half.</p>
    <p>The Celtics trailed by as many as 12 points in each of the first two pe­ri­ods and 58-51 at half-time, but then took less than four min­utes of the third quar­ter to level the score af­ter a bas­ket from Mi­ami’s Bam Ade­bayo had ex­tended the mar­gin to nine on the sec­ond half’s first pos­ses­sion.</p>
    <p>“We knew we had to play bet­ter. We were fight­ing for our life,” said Ta­tum. “It was go­ing to take a col­lec­tive ef­fort in the sec­ond half, and that’s what we did.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing down 3-1 is not fun. We’ve got to take it one game at a time.”</p>
    <p>Jaylen Brown (28 points) and Daniel Theis (15) had hoops and Kemba Walker (15) two free throws be­fore Mar­cus Smart’s (12) three­p­ointer drew the Celtics even at 60-60.</p>
    <p>Brown added a go-ahead bas­ket 24 sec­onds later and, when Ta­tum dropped in two free throws, Bos­ton had used a 13-0 flurry to take a lead they never re­lin­quished at 64-60.</p>
    <p>Ta­tum added 15 more points in the pe­riod, six on two three-point­ers, help­ing the Celtics go up by as</p>
    <p>many as 14 points at 92-78.</p>
    <p>Mi­ami hung within 97-89 with 8min 55sec to play, but Brown slammed the door with con­sec­u­tive three-point­ers, al­low­ing the Celtics to coast home with their sec­ond win in the last three games.</p>
    <p>The win sends the clubs to a Game 6 tonight, with the fifth­seeded Heat need­ing just one more win to ad­vance to their first NBA Fi­nals since 2014.</p>
    <p>The Celtics are at­tempt­ing to over­come a 3-1 se­ries deficit for the first time since elim­i­nat­ing Philadel­phia in the 1981 East­ern Fi­nals en route to the NBA cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>Heat coach Erik Spoel­stra ad­mit­ted de­feat, say­ing that the Celtics “played great in the sec­ond half”.</p>
    <p>“They de­served and earned what they got. We un­der­stand how</p>
    <p>tough it is to win in the play-offs,” he added. “We did not com­pete hard enough de­fen­sively, and we paid the price for that.”</p>
    <p>Go­ran Dragic had a team-high 23 points for the Heat while Dun­can Robin­son had 20.</p>
    <p>Jimmy But­ler (17 points), Jae Crow­der (14), Tyler Herro (14) and Ade­bayo (13) also scored in dou­ble fig­ures.</p>
    <p>The win­ners of the se­ries take on ei­ther the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers or the Den­ver Nuggets for the NBA ti­tle in the quar­an­tine bubble in Or­lando, Florida.</p>
    <p>The Lak­ers lead the Nuggets 3-1 in the Western Con­fer­ence Fi­nals.</p>
    <p>We knew we had to play bet­ter. We were fight­ing for our life. It was go­ing to take a col­lec­tive ef­fort in the sec­ond half, and that’s what we did.</p>
