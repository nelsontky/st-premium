    <p>Many coun­tries, in­clud­ing Ja­pan and Bri­tain, and cities like Hong Kong are fac­ing fresh waves of Covid-19 in­fec­tion and, with that, move­ment re­stric­tions and lock­downs at the height of the hol­i­day sea­son.</p>
    <p>Over the past year, coun­tries have been mak­ing cru­cial de­ci­sions to keep the coro­n­avirus from spread­ing while, at the same time, al­low­ing peo­ple to live as close to their pre-pan­demic lives as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>A re­cent study pub­lished in med­i­cal jour­nal The Lancet found that a com­bi­na­tion of move­ment re­stric­tions, from ban­ning public events to clos­ing schools, can limit the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the re­searchers ar­gued that pol­i­cy­mak­ers should also look at the tim­ing of when these mea­sures are turned on and off, as this fac­tored more into their ef­fec­tive­ness than the mea­sures them­selves.</p>
    <p>Dr You Li, a re­search fel­low at the Univer­sity of Ed­in­burgh who worked on the study, said the big­gest take­away was to note the “de­lay in see­ing the ef­fect of both in­tro­duc­ing and later re­lax­ing in­ter­ven­tions”.</p>
    <p>In some cases, it could take up to two to four weeks to see any im­pact of the mea­sure.</p>
    <p>The authoritie­s should in­stead try to mon­i­tor the “R ra­tio”, which shows how long the outbreak has been spread­ing at a faster speed, as a pos­si­ble sig­nal for when to turn on or off cer­tain mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The R rate is a num­ber that pol­i­cy­mak­ers fol­low to see if the outbreak is grow­ing or de­creas­ing, rapidly or slowly. An R rate of more than one is bad be­cause it shows a grow­ing outbreak. If the R rate is con­sis­tently more than one and get­ting higher, this is re­ally bad.</p>
    <p>Dr Li, how­ever, also cau­tions pol­i­cy­mak­ers to not re­lax mea­sures too soon, be­cause if there is a need for a sub­se­quent in­ter­ven­tion, the im­pact on slow­ing the spread would not be as ef­fec­tive the next time it is used be­cause “pan­demic fa­tigue” would have set in and peo­ple may not be as com­pli­ant with mea­sures as they were the first time. pore, In­done­sia, the Philip­pines, In­dia, Ja­pan, South Korea and Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>The “wave pat­terns” for each place paint an in­ter­est­ing pic­ture of how and when each mea­sure was im­ple­mented. Most of them did use sim­i­lar mea­sures but the ef­fec­tive­ness was the re­sult of an in­tri­cate com­bi­na­tion of good tim­ing that also var­ied de­pend­ing on the lo­cal situation.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, for ex­am­ple, has man­aged to come out of its first wave. So has In­dia and the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan and South Korea, how­ever, are now in their third wave. In­done­sia’s first wave is still on­go­ing, and Tai­wan did not even have one at all.</p>
