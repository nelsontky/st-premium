    <p>With the cir­cuit breaker hav­ing been in place for most of April and all of May, lead­ing to wide­spread busi­ness shut­downs, the job num­bers for the se­cond quar­ter were ex­pected to be grim, and that is how they turned out. The un­em­ploy­ment rate jumped to 2.9 per cent, from 2.4 per cent in the first quar­ter, the high­est level in more than a decade. To­tal em­ploy­ment plunged by 121,800 – the big­gest quar­terly fall on record, and re­trench­ments more than dou­bled com­pared with the first quar­ter. The lay­offs spanned most sec­tors, in­clud­ing whole­sale trade and trans­port, as well as con­struc­tion, restau­rants, re­tail, en­ter­tain­ment, recre­ation, the arts, and ed­u­ca­tion. They came from not only small and medium-sized en­ter­prises, but also large lo­cal en­ter­prises and multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions. The ac­tual pic­ture could be worse than the num­bers sug­gest. As NTUC as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Pa­trick Tay pointed out, the em­ploy­ment num­bers ex­clude older work­ers who are not re-em­ployed or for­eign­ers whose work passes are not re­newed, while lay­offs do not in­clude those by com­pa­nies with fewer than 25 staff, such as small re­tail­ers and restau­rants.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo cau­tioned that the job losses are un­likely to have bot­tomed out, given the weak­ness in global de­mand as well as lo­cal pri­vate con­sump­tion. More­over, many of the lay­offs aris­ing from the cir­cuit breaker will show up only in the third quar­ter, and the num­ber could rise with the ex­pi­ra­tion of the Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS) this month.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment plans to cre­ate some 100,000 new jobs. Apart from the JSS, which has prob­a­bly pre­vented thou­sands of lay­offs, at­tach­ments un­der the SGUnited Jobs and Skills pro­gramme – which has now been ex­tended to mid-ca­reer work­ers – will cre­ate at least 34,000 new po­si­tions. The pub­lic sec­tor will also step up hir­ing.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, cre­at­ing enough jobs to cover all the job losses over the com­ing months will be an up­hill task; thou­sands of work­ers could re­main unem­ployed or be forced into self-em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>This un­der­lines the need to ex­plore ad­di­tional op­tions. One mea­sure to pre­vent fur­ther job losses has been the extension of waivers and re­bates on for­eign worker levies. An­other is to en­sure, with the help of trade unions, that re­trench­ments are a last re­sort af­ter other mea­sures, such as pay cuts and job shar­ing, have been ex­hausted.</p>
    <p>But the plight of the grow­ing num­bers of unem­ployed also war­rants more at­ten­tion. Although the Gov­ern­ment main­tains that un­em­ploy­ment in­sur­ance is more ap­pro­pri­ate in economies prone to struc­tural un­em­ploy­ment – which Sin­ga­pore is not – in the present cri­sis, which could be long­drawn, the chances of pro­longed un­em­ploy­ment have risen. This would call for forms of in­come sup­port for the job­less that are less ad hoc and more au­to­matic, even if for a tem­po­rary pe­riod.</p>
