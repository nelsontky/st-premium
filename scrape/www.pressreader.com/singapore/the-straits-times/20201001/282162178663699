    <p>In the in­ter­est of im­prov­ing pub­lic hy­giene stan­dards in our food cen­tres, I have some thoughts on ameni­ties for keep­ing our hands clean.</p>
    <p>Since the start of the Covid-19 cri­sis, there has been more aware­ness about wash­ing our hands reg­u­larly with soap.</p>
    <p>I made a com­plaint to Bis­han Town Coun­cil about the soap dis­pensers in Shunfu mar­ket be­ing fre­quently empty or filled with greatly di­luted soap.</p>
    <p>There was a prompt re­sponse – the num­ber of basins was in­creased from two to four and new soap dis­pensers were added.</p>
    <p>For a while, things were fine, but soon, the dis­pensers were again of­ten empty or filled with greatly di­luted soap. Do we keep on call­ing the town coun­cil to in­ter­vene?</p>
    <p>Bis­han Town Coun­cil should im­pose a pro­gres­sive penalty on the op­er­a­tor.</p>
    <p>Then, there’s the use of push taps. Th­ese should be re­placed. Of­ten, you have to keep one hand pressed on the tap to get the wa­ter go­ing. How does one wash one’s hands thor­oughly with just one hand?</p>
    <p>Ide­ally, th­ese taps should be re­placed with those that come with auto sen­sors like the ones at Sem­bawang hawker cen­tre. It is also the most hy­gienic.</p>
    <p>All soap dispenser can­is­ters should be trans­par­ent, and the op­er­a­tors must make it a point to top them up reg­u­larly de­pend­ing on user traf­fic at any given cen­tre.</p>
    <p>In­for­ma­tion on who to con­tact for feed­back on such mat­ters should also be dis­played more promi­nently than it is now.</p>
    <p>There is a world­wide pan­demic. Wash­ing hands prop­erly is an im­por­tant mat­ter.</p>
