    <p>GLAS­GOW • World No. 304 Sophia Popov on Sun­day be­came the first Ger­man to win a women’s Ma­jor with vic­tory in the Bri­tish Open, just a year af­ter be­ing on the verge of quit­ting golf.</p>
    <p>Three ahead at the start of the fi­nal round, the 27-year-old fin­ished on seven-un­der 277 af­ter card­ing a three-un­der 68, with Thai­land’s Jas­mine Suwan­na­pura in sec­ond, two shots off the pace.</p>
    <p>Popov was in tears even be­fore she hit the fi­nal putt, and was over­come with emo­tion as she left the fi­nal green at Royal Troon.</p>
    <p>“I haven’t talked about it be­fore but I had a lot of health is­sues in my early time on (the LPGA) Tour. Af­ter a cou­ple of years, it was fi­nally di­ag­nosed as Lyme dis­ease,” she said.</p>
    <p>“It is some­thing that sticks with you, but I am very care­ful with my nutri­tion and work­ing out. But it took a lot of per­sonal re­search and now I feel pretty good.”</p>
    <p>A com­pro­mised im­mune sys­tem was not the only hur­dle Popov had to face en route to her maiden win.</p>
    <p>Just ear­lier this month, she was a cad­die for Dutch­woman Anne van Dam at the Drive On Cham­pi­onship – the LPGA’s first event since Fe­bru­ary be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Prior to the first Ma­jor of the year, Popov had only played in one out of three tune-up events – fin­ish­ing joint-ninth at the Marathon Clas­sic – and only had one prac­tice round be­fore be­gin­ning her maiden ti­tle bid be­hind closed doors.</p>
    <p>But she re­vealed to Golfweek that car­ry­ing the bags for her friend gave her a fresh per­spec­tive on “what is the smart de­ci­sion to make here” and it was not nec­es­sary to be al­ways ag­gres­sive on the pins.</p>
    <p>In line with her lack of fi­nal­round ex­pe­ri­ence, Popov made a shaky start, hit­ting her open­ing tee shot into a bunker and go­ing on to make a bo­gey five.</p>
    <p>But with her Ger­man boyfriend Max as her cad­die, she bounced back with birdies from in­side 10 feet at the par-four sec­ond and par­four third and never wa­vered.</p>
    <p>The new world No. 24 made another birdie at the par-five No. 6 and vi­tal back nine birdies at the par-four 15th and par-five 16th helped seal the deal.</p>
    <p>Three ahead with three to play, she was able to en­joy the fi­nal walk and later cred­ited her part­ner, who talked about the birth of her niece, for calm­ing her nerves.</p>
    <p>“I can hardly get any­thing out of my mouth,” said Popov.</p>
    <p>“I was so ner­vous to­day and this is just un­be­liev­able... I’m just so grate­ful to my boyfriend for keep­ing me calm.”</p>
    <p>Suwan­na­pura did her best to ruin the fairy-tale run.</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old two-time LPGA</p>
    <p>Tour win­ner got to within a shot af­ter a fine run of four birdies in a row from the fourth and af­ter bo­geys at the par-four 11th and par-four 13th, she again ap­plied the pres­sure with birdies at the 16th and par-three 17th.</p>
    <p>But it was only good enough for the run­ners-up spot, two ahead of Aus­tralia’s Min­jee Lee, who fin­ished out­right third af­ter a 69.</p>
    <p>Be­fore Sun­day Popov had won just US$108,000 (S$148,000) on the Tour, but her bank ac­count has now swelled by another US$675,000.</p>
    <p>She joins two Ger­man men as Ma­jor cham­pi­ons – Bernhard Langer won the 1985 and 1993 Masters, while Martin Kaymer claimed the 2010 PGA Cham­pi­onship and 2014 US Open.</p>
