    <p>• Arse­nal man­ager Mikel Arteta is frus­trated with his side’s lack of goals i n the Premier League and hopes their con­sis­tency in Cup com­pe­ti­tions will help them redis­cover their touch. The Gun­ners are through to the Europa League knock­out phase with a per­fect record in the group stage and have scored 20 goals in six games. They are also in the quar­ter-fi­nals of the League Cup. How­ever, they have won only once in their last seven league matches, scor­ing 10 goals in 11 league games this sea­son to find them­selves 15th in the Premier League – 11 points be­hind lead­ers Tot­ten­ham.</p>
    <p>“We are very frus­trated with that and we know how im­por­tant it is to put those re­sults to­gether re­ally quickly,” Arteta told re­porters ahead of to­day’s home match against Burn­ley.</p>
    <p>“There have been a lot of games, es­pe­cially... at home, where small de­tails have made a huge dif­fer­ence. But we haven’t scored enough goals and, with­out do­ing that, we can­not win matches.</p>
    <p>“We are work­ing on dif­fer­ent as­pects that we have to im­prove.”</p>
    <p>Arse­nal are un­beaten against Burn­ley in their last 14 en­coun­ters in all com­pe­ti­tions, win­ning ev­ery home game in that run, but Arteta said sta­tis­tics would not make a dif­fer­ence against Sean Dy­che’s side.</p>
    <p>“Burn­ley are a re­ally or­gan­ised team. They are a con­stant threat be­cause they are re­ally di­rect but they play that game re­ally, re­ally well,” he said. “They man­age their first, sec­ond and third phases re­ally well. They are dif­fi­cult to break down.”</p>
    <p>De­spite Arse­nal’s poor form, the club’s chief ex­ec­u­tive, Vi­nai Venkate­sham, has backed Arteta to turn the team’s for­tunes around.</p>
    <p>“You’ve got an in­di­vid­ual who has ex­tra­or­di­nary ex­pe­ri­ence in the Premier League across his time at Arse­nal, Ever­ton, Manch­ester City and then back at Arse­nal,” he told The Times of Lon­don.</p>
    <p>“You have got a guy that un­der­stands what it means to play for this club. You’ve got a guy who is ab­so­lutely driven to suc­ceed.”</p>
    <p>Arse­nal mid­fielder Thomas Partey is set to be out for an­other cou­ple of matches af­ter limp­ing off dur­ing last week­end’s 2-0 loss at Tot­ten­ham, while Gabriel Martinelli and David Luiz are mi­nor doubts for to­day’s game.</p>
