    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has trig­gered rapid changes in the clean­ing in­dus­try, as the over­whelm­ing de­mand for more clean­ers and bet­ter clean­ing ser­vices is likely to ex­tend far be­yond the out­break.</p>
    <p>One in­di­ca­tion of these changes as the in­dus­try tries to meet in­creased de­mand for its ser­vices is the big uptick in ap­pli­ca­tions for the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency’s (NEA) en­hanced En­vi­ron­men­tal Ser­vices Pro­duc­tiv­ity So­lu­tions Grant (ES PSG).</p>
    <p>The grant, which was launched in Septem­ber 2018 to raise the op­er­a­tional ef­fi­ciency and pro­duc­tiv­ity of the en­vi­ron­men­tal ser­vice in­dus­try, will now de­fray up to 80 per cent of the cost of the clean­ing so­lu­tions that com­mer­cial busi­nesses choose to adopt as part of their clean­ing sys­tems.</p>
    <p>As at last Wednesday, NEA had ap­proved more than 770 ap­pli­ca­tions from com­pa­nies for the grant, with a to­tal com­mit­ment of about $15 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>This amount will be capped at $350,000 a com­pany, and is an in­crease from the fund­ing sup­port of up to 50 per cent and grant cap of $250,000 a com­pany that was pre­vi­ously avail­able.</p>
    <p>An NEA spokesman said: “The en­vi­ron­men­tal ser­vices (ES) in­dus­try is fac­ing man­power short­age and op­er­a­tional chal­lenges due to Covid-19. Gen­er­ally, ES firms are fac­ing man­power short­age for core oc­cu­pa­tions, such as gen­eral clean­ers, waste col­lec­tion at­ten­dants and pest con­trol work­ers.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion also pro­vided the ES in­dus­try with unique op­por­tu­ni­ties to trans­form and emerge stronger.” The spokesman added that the agency ex­pects the de­mand for clean­ing and dis­in­fec­tion ser­vices to con­tinue post-Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The wide­spread adop­tion of more clean­ing tech­nol­ogy, such as ro­botic floor sweep­ers, work­force man­age­ment and other dig­i­tal so­lu­tions could give ES com­pa­nies the chance to up­skill their work­force and im­prove the tech­no­log­i­cal know-how of the clean­ing in­dus­try as a whole.</p>
    <p>The ES PSG is also set to re­duce the sec­tor’s reliance on man­ual labour and cre­ate bet­ter jobs for the sec­tor, go­ing for­ward.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, to meet the in­creased de­mand for clean­ers pro­vid­ing dis­in­fec­tion ser­vices for com­mer­cial and res­i­den­tial needs, Work­force Sin­ga­pore and NEA have also part­nered the En­vi­ron­men­tal Man­age­ment As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore to launch a “Place-andTrain” pro­gramme for clean­ing spe­cial­ists in dis­in­fec­tion ser­vices this month.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies at the fore­front of tech­no­log­i­cal and dig­i­tal clean­ing so­lu­tions are also dou­bling down to put more clean­ing sys­tems out in the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Sin­ga­pore com­pany Lion­sBot In­ter­na­tional has seen an in­crease in de­mand for clean­ing and dis­in­fec­tion ro­bots since March, and has re­ceived 80 per cent more in­quiries about its ser­vices since the pan­demic be­gan.</p>
    <p>Mr John Chan, vice-pres­i­dent of busi­ness devel­op­ment at Lion­sBot, said: “We man­u­fac­ture a va­ri­ety of floor-clean­ing ro­bots that scrub, mop and vac­uum. These ro­bots are in such high de­mand be­cause they are able to sup­port clean­ers (by do­ing) time-con­sum­ing clean­ing tasks, so the clean­ers can fo­cus on things like wip­ing down high-touch-point ar­eas, toi­lets and hid­den cor­ners where germs might lurk.”</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, its au­ton­o­mous UV­light dis­in­fec­tion ro­bot helps clean­ers dis­in­fect large sur­face ar­eas without ex­pos­ing them to viruses – par­tic­u­larly at high-risk premises with heavy foot­fall, such as trans­port ter­mi­nals, hos­pi­tals and shop­ping cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Such clean­ing ro­bots have helped the clean­ing in­dus­try cope with labour short­ages. It faces chal­lenges that in­clude the need for more fre­quent clean­ing and rig­or­ous clean­ing stan­dards, cou­pled with the lack of man­power to sup­port this de­mand, said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>Lion­sBot is look­ing to­wards growing its busi­ness, as the de­mand for clean­ing ro­bots has in­creased both lo­cally and glob­ally.</p>
    <p>“We are ex­pand­ing our busi­ness to in­no­vate and de­sign more types of clean­ing ro­bots, and to in­crease Lion­sBot’s pro­duc­tion out­put. At the mo­ment, we are also hir­ing and train­ing staff to sup­port this busi­ness ex­pan­sion,” said Mr Chan.</p>
