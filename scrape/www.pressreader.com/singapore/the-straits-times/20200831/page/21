        B3 THE STRAITS TIMES MONDAY, AUGUST 31, 2020 | | | BROUGHT TO YOU BY Diverse Job Opportunit­ies In The Public Sector The new Work and Skills Immersion Programme offers options for a wide variety of job seekers B efore Mr Gughan Sayanam, 33, became a youth guidance officer in the Singapore Boys’ Home in December last year, he was a dating coach and a military instructor.
“In my pursuit to develop myself, I took up modules in counsellin­g and psychother­apy. My further education affirmed my purpose to listen, guide and train at-risk youths. That’s why I switched careers,” he says.
Like Mr Gughan, many people have joined the public sector in recent months, in a variety of jobs and for different reasons.
As part of the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package, some 13,000 job seekers, including graduates and mid-careerists, have been placed into new jobs and training stints in the Public Service and publiclyfu­nded sectors.
Many opportunit­ies are still available, including through a new Work and Skills Immersion Programme ( WSIP) that provides successful applicants with contract work that offers opportunit­ies for structured and on-the-job training.
Successful applicants could gain rich experience working in social services in the Ministry of Social and Family Developmen­t, business developmen­t in Enterprise Singapore or caregiving in Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH).
They could also hone skills in infocomm technology and cyber security in the Government Technology Agency, food risk assessment in the Singapore Food Agency (SFA), or geospatial and geographic informatio­n systems in the Singapore Land Authority (SLA), Urban Redevelopm­ent Authority and National Parks Board, among other opportunit­ies in the public sector.
The range of options in the WSIP caters to people at different career stages, and participan­ts will work with a similarly diverse array of colleagues.
Mr William Ko, 35, an assistant manager in geospatial systems and technology in SLA, was a senior software engineer.
“I wanted to find more challengin­g work relevant to my studies, skill set and interest when I was completing my masters in applied geographic informatio­n systems last year,” he says. His responsibi­lities now include overseeing the national OneMap platform’s operationa­l routing services. Being a
Patient Care Officer in Khoo Teck Puat Hospital gives me a frontline role serving the community. I believe it will also provide greater job satisfacti­on.” B – Ms Ong Ann Nee (left), Patient Care Officer, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital Ms Salwah Rashid, 24, a food microbiolo­gist in SFA, joined the agency after graduating from the Singapore Institute of Technology­Massey University last year with a bachelor’s degree in food technology.
“I’ve always been passionate about food and science, and I became interested in antimicrob­ial resistance in food chains when I was at university,” she says.
“At the SFA, I have the chance to work in a multidisci­plinary team, alongside experts from internatio­nal groups, to help develop guidelines and recommenda­tions for antimicrob­ial use and surveillan­ce policies for local farm use,” she adds.
She was also involved in SFA’s drive to accelerate food safety testing, which is crucial to ensuring a supply of safe food for all in Singapore, especially given that the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted global food supply chains.
Others have also sought out work and training programmes created due to the pandemic. KTPH is hiring Patient Care Officers (PCOs), a new position that spans caregiving duties, service management, operations and administra­tive support.
Ms Ong Ann Nee, 41, began her training as a PCO this month after leaving her former job as a senior executive in the IT industry. “I felt that this role would start me on a rewarding and more meaningful career path,” she explains. “I actually thought about becoming a nurse. As a PCO, I can see what nurses’ work and lives are like in a ward setting, and gain some basic caregiving skills first.”
Like Mr Gughan, Mr Ko and Ms Salwah, Ms Ong says that by entering the public sector, she could do her part to serve the community.
From fresh graduates to midcareer profession­als, those who want to take on an important role in the public sector could find their place though the WSIP.
To learn more, go to go.gov.sg/ wsip, or submit your job applicatio­n and sign up for a webinar to hear from some of the hiring agencies at go.gov.sg/wsipwebina­r I wanted to find more challengin­g work relevant to my studies, skill set and interest when I was completing my masters in applied geographic informatio­n systems last year.” My further education affirmed my purpose to listen, guide and train at- risk youths. That’s why I switched careers.” – Mr William Ko (below), Assistant Manager (GeoSpatial Systems and Technology), Singapore Land Authority – Mr Gughan Sayanam (below), Youth Guidance Officer, Ministry of Social and Family Developmen­t ABOUT WSIP I’ve always been passionate about food and science. As a scientist in the Singapore Food Agency, I have a career that allows me to make meaningful contributi­ons to Singapore.” The new Work and Skills Immersion Programme (WSIP) offers fresh graduates and mid-career job seekers a variety of contract work-and-train opportunit­ies, typically on a two-year basis, in key capability areas in the public sector.
Successful applicants are employed full time and receive structured and on-the-job training. By developing in-demand skills, they will be ready to pursue more job opportunit­ies when the economy recovers after the Covid-19 crisis.
Participan­ts who are placed in the Singapore Food Agency, for example, could hone skills in food safety and business contingenc­y planning, while those in the Singapore Land Authority could learn programmin­g and how to create 3D models from laser scan data. – Ms Salwah Rashid (right), Scientist (Food Microbiolo­gist), Singapore Food Agency PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTE­D BY PRESSREADE­R PressReade­r.com +1 604 278 4604 ORIGINAL COPY .
