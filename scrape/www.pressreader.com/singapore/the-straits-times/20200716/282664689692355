    <p>Me­di­a­corp has apol­o­gised for a con­tro­ver­sial pae­dophile char­ac­ter with a pen­chant for young boys in Chan­nel 8 drama se­ries My Guardian An­gels, which wrapped its run in May.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily drama was crit­i­cised by the les­bian, gay, bi­sex­ual, trans­gen­der and queer (LGBTQ) com­mu­nity for fea­tur­ing a pae­dophile bas­ket­ball coach with sex­u­ally trans­mit­ted dis­eases (STDs) who was even­tu­ally jailed for mo­lest­ing teenage boys. The show stars Zoe Tay, Kym Ng and Hong Ling as mothers strug­gling to raise their chil­dren alone. Ac­tor Chase Tan plays the coach.</p>
    <p>The broad­caster said in a state­ment to The Straits Times on Tues­day that it had “no in­ten­tion to dis­re­spect or dis­crim­i­nate against the LGBTQ com­mu­nity in the drama” and the sto­ry­line was meant to “en­cour­age young peo­ple to be aware of po­ten­tial dan­gers and not be afraid to speak up and pro­tect them­selves”.</p>
    <p>A Me­di­a­corp spokesman said there was “no spe­cific men­tion of the sex­ual ori­en­ta­tion” of the pae­dophile char­ac­ter in the drama.</p>
    <p>Another widely crit­i­cised thread was Bran­don Wong and Ng as par­ents wor­ry­ing about the sex­ual ori­en­ta­tion of their son. Me­di­a­corp said this was “to de­pict the real life strug­gles some par­ents face in com­mu­ni­cat­ing with their chil­dren on top­ics such as re­la­tion­ships and sex­ual ori­en­ta­tion”.</p>
    <p>It urged ne­ti­zens not to make per­sonal at­tacks on Wong and Ng, who have re­ceived “abu­sive mes­sages” for their in­volve­ment in the pro­ject.</p>
    <p>The apol­ogy comes af­ter sev­eral days of con­tro­versy, with ne­ti­zens tak­ing to Chan­nel 8’s In­sta­gram ac­count to de­mand an ex­pla­na­tion.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment dated July 8, Ac­tion For Aids, a non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion ded­i­cated to fight­ing Aids/HIV in­fec­tion, con­demned the por­trayal.</p>
    <p>It said: “To our knowl­edge, there is no ev­i­dence that ho­mo­sex­ual males have a greater propen­sity to of­fend against chil­dren than het­ero­sex­ual males.</p>
    <p>“The por­trayal of gay men as pae­dophiles fur­ther per­pet­u­ates false­hoods that cre­ate fur­ther suf­fer­ing among an al­ready marginalis­ed and stig­ma­tised pop­u­la­tion.”</p>
    <p>It also added that STDs can af­fect any­one and are “not con­fined to any gen­der iden­tity, sex­ual ori­en­ta­tion or be­hav­iour”.</p>
    <p>Tan, who played the char­ac­ter in ques­tion, apol­o­gised on July 3. He said on In­sta­gram: “I’m deeply sad­dened that the role I played has caused dis­tress in the com­mu­nity and I’d like to em­pha­sise that it was never my in­ten­tion. I’m an as­pir­ing ac­tor and every op­por­tu­nity given to me is pre­cious. I do not mean to dis­re­spect any­one.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to guide­lines by the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Author­ity, con­tent on free-to-air tele­vi­sion should not pro­mote or jus­tify the ho­mo­sex­ual life­style.</p>
