    <p>We thank Mr Damian Ng Swee</p>
    <p>Beng and Ms Ang Chiew Leng for their let­ters (Have all re­turnees serve quar­an­tine or­ders only at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties; Shouldn’t in­bound trav­ellers be tested on ar­rival?, both July 29).</p>
    <p>Since March 21, all in­com­ing trav­ellers have been re­quired to serve a 14-day stay-home no­tice (SHN). As an ad­di­tional pre­cau­tion, trav­ellers en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore from June 18 are tested be­fore the end of their SHN.</p>
    <p>As the coro­n­avirus has an av­er­age in­cu­ba­tion pe­riod of five to six days, with a max­i­mum of up to 14 days, a swab test at the point of ar­rival may not pick up cases dur­ing the in­cu­ba­tion pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers un­der special bi­lat­eral ar­range­ments with se­lected coun­tries, such as China and Malaysia, also have sep­a­rate mea­sures to re­duce the risk of im­ported cases based on the risk as­sess­ment of these coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Based on the rel­a­tive risks of im­por­ta­tion and tak­ing into ac­count mea­sures other coun­tries and re­gions have taken to con­trol the in­fec­tion, trav­ellers from se­lected coun­tries and re­gions have been al­lowed to serve their SHN in their own place of res­i­dence.</p>
    <p>They are nonethe­less re­quired to re­main in their place of res­i­dence at all times, and are sub­ject to close mon­i­tor­ing of their where­abouts through elec­tronic mon­i­tor­ing as well as phys­i­cal checks.</p>
    <p>For those serv­ing their SHN at ded­i­cated SHN fa­cil­i­ties, trans­port is ar­ranged to send them di­rectly from the check­points to the fa­cil­i­ties on ar­rival. They also un­dergo test­ing at the fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>Those serv­ing their SHN in their own place of res­i­dence are ad­vised to use only their own pri­vate trans­port or a pre-booked taxi via ded­i­cated taxi hot­lines pro­vided to travel to the des­ig­nated test­ing site and back im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>The multi-min­istry task force con­tin­ues to mon­i­tor the global sit­u­a­tion and will up­date the bor­der mea­sures to man­age the risks of im­por­ta­tion and com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion. Lim Siok Peng</p>
