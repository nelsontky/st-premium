    <p>Malaysia’s former fi­nance min­is­ter Lim Guan Eng yes­ter­day pleaded not guilty af­ter be­ing charged with re­ceiv­ing a RM3.3 mil­lion (S$1.1 mil­lion) bribe linked to the Penang un­der­sea tun­nel project when he was leader of the state.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s former fi­nance min­is­ter Lim Guan Eng was charged yes­ter­day morn­ing with re­ceiv­ing a RM3.3 mil­lion (S$1.1 mil­lion) bribe in re­la­tion to the Penang un­der­sea tun­nel project dur­ing his ten­ure as the state’s chief min­is­ter. He pleaded not guilty.</p>
    <p>This is the sec­ond charge that Lim, who was chief min­is­ter from 2008 to 2018, is fac­ing.</p>
    <p>The charge was read out at the Ses­sions Court in Penang.</p>
    <p>The 59-year-old was last week ar­rested and charged i n Kuala Lumpur by the coun­try’s anti-cor­rup­tion body with so­lic­it­ing a bribe based on fu­ture profits for the same project.</p>
    <p>Lim, who is con­test­ing both charges, is out on a RM1 mil­lion bail.</p>
    <p>He is due to face an­other un­spec­i­fied charge to­day.</p>
    <p>The Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party (DAP) opposition politi­cian, whose wife was also ar­rested last week and may be charged to­day over money-laun­der­ing al­le­ga­tions, has claimed that the cor­rup­tion charges against him are a form of po­lit­i­cal per­se­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>The RM6.3 bil­lion Penang un­der­sea tun­nel project has been on the radar of the Malaysian Anti-Cor­rup­tion Com­mis­sion (MACC) since 2017. But the in­ves­ti­ga­tion against Lim picked up pace only re­cently, months af­ter the Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) ad­min­is­tra­tion lost fed­eral power to the Perikatan Na­sional fol­low­ing a se­ries of de­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Lim was fi­nance min­is­ter for 22 months in the PH gov­ern­ment, and is the sec­re­tary-gen­eral of DAP, which is the party with the most num­ber of elected rep­re­sen­ta­tives in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>The vet­eran politi­cian faces a jail term of up to 20 years if found guilty, sim­i­lar to the penalty for the charge he faces in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>The charge in Penang will also be trans­ferred to the KL courts next month, mean­ing both of his cor­rup­tion tri­als will take place in the Malaysian cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>“The pros­e­cu­tion made the ap­peal (to trans­fer) and the judge al­lowed the ap­pli­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“Both this case and the first charge are due to be heard at the KL court on Sept 9,” Lim’s lawyer Gobind Singh Deo said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Lim main­tained his in­no­cence at a press con­fer­ence af­ter he was charged in Penang, and said that the MACC had never asked him about the sup­posed RM3.3 mil­lion grat­i­fi­ca­tion he al­legedly re­ceived from the con­trac­tor of the Penang un­der­sea tun­nel while he was chief min­is­ter of the state.</p>
    <p>“They never asked me this. MACC has never shown where this RM3.3 mil­lion is, it is not in my bank ac­counts, I don’t have RM3.3 mil­lion in cash,” Lim told re­porters, call­ing the al­le­ga­tion “base­less” and “po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated”.</p>
    <p>Lim was twice in­car­cer­ated by the gov­ern­ment dur­ing his years as an opposition politi­cian.</p>
    <p>He spent 1½ years be­hind bars without trial in the late 1980s, fol­low­ing a gov­ern­ment crack­down on ac­tivists, schol­ars and politi­cians. He was also im­pris­oned for a year un­der the colo­nial-era Sedi­tion Act in 1998, over a con­tro­ver­sial statu­tory rape is­sue against a former state chief min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>He was also charged with cor­rup­tion in 2016 over the pur­chase of a bun­ga­low, at be­low-mar­ket price, dur­ing his ten­ure as Penang chief min­is­ter, but the charges were dropped in 2018.</p>
