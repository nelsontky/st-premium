    <p>EVER­TON MAN­AGER, sin­gling out League Cup op­po­nents Manch­ester United’s strengths.</p>
    <p>LON­DON • Timo Werner ar­rived at Chelsea in the sum­mer with a big rep­u­ta­tion as one of Europe’s hottest strik­ers.</p>
    <p>But the for­mer RB Leipzig star has had a slow start to life at Stam­ford Bridge fol­low­ing his £47.5 mil­lion (S$85.2 mil­lion) trans­fer, scor­ing just four Premier League goals in 14 games. He has also now failed to find the back of the net in his last eight starts.</p>
    <p>How­ever, af­ter see­ing Chelsea beat West Ham 3-0 thanks to a Tammy Abra­ham dou­ble and a Thi­ago Silva header on Mon­day, Blues man­ager Frank Lam­pard claimed he was not wor­ried.</p>
    <p>In­sist­ing the Ger­man in­ter­na­tional, who has eight strikes in 21 games for Chelsea in all com­pe­ti­tions, will start fir­ing on all cylin­ders, he said: “That’s the pe­riod Timo is in, it’s un­for­tu­nate but he’s get­ting in the po­si­tions – when one (goal) goes in it will be a run for him. Ev­ery striker will want to be scor­ing goals, it’s what they ul­ti­mately get judged on and that’s why Timo was a great ac­qui­si­tion for us be­cause of the level of goals he’s scored in the last few years.</p>
    <p>“He’s a player in a new league and we have to give him time to set­tle but he’s get­ting po­si­tions reg­u­larly, he’s scar­ing teams and giv­ing them a prob­lem...</p>
    <p>“West Ham are a good team on good form, so many threats, I thought to­day would be a tough match and it proved to be so, even in the not beau­ti­ful mo­ments, we de­fended su­perbly – Thi­ago Silva did bril­liantly with that.</p>
    <p>“We dropped off slightly and it was im­por­tant tonight we came back.”</p>
    <p>The Blues bounced back from two suc­ces­sive league de­feats and closed in on the top four as they moved up to fifth in the stand­ings. They are one point be­hind fourth</p>
    <p>placed Ever­ton and six adrift of cham­pi­ons and lead­ers Liver­pool.</p>
    <p>But pun­dits re­main con­cerned, not just about Werner but also the form of an­other sum­mer sign­ing, com­pa­triot Kai Havertz.</p>
    <p>The £71 mil­lion buy from Bayer Lev­erkusen has just one goal from 12 Premier League games and did not start against the Ham­mers.</p>
    <p>Jamie Car­ragher told Sky Sports</p>
    <p>Lam­pard had made the right de­ci­sion as he cur­rently has bet­ter op­tions in mid­field.</p>
    <p>“Some­times, play­ers fall into that cat­e­gory where you’re not sure they fit in,” the for­mer Liver­pool de­fender said. “For me, right now Chelsea look stronger with N’Golo Kante, (Ma­son) Mount and one other, Ma­teo Ko­vacic or Jorginho.”</p>
