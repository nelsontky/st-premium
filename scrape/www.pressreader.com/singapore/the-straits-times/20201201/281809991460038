    <p>SEOUL • For­mer South Korean pres­i­dent Chun Doo-hwan was found guilty yes­ter­day of de­fam­ing a dead priest, in con­nec­tion with a pro-democ­racy up­ris­ing his troops crushed 40 years ago.</p>
    <p>The 89-year-old dozed off as the ver­dict was read out in Gwangju, where the 1980 protests ended in a blood­bath, but he was spared a re­turn to prison.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cial toll for the dead or miss­ing is around 200 peo­ple, but ac­tivists say it may have been three times as high.</p>
    <p>Chun, who is known as the “Butcher of Gwangju”, still de­nies any di­rect in­volve­ment in the sup­pres­sion of the up­ris­ing, and had, in a 2017 mem­oir, de­nounced a priest who had re­peat­edly tes­ti­fied that he­li­copter gun­ships had opened fire on civil­ians, as “Satan in a mask”.</p>
    <p>Un­der South Korean li­bel law, defama­tion can be a crim­i­nal of­fence as well as a civil mat­ter, rel­a­tives can file such com­plaints on be­half of dead peo­ple, and truth is not nec­es­sar­ily a de­fence.</p>
    <p>The priest’s fam­ily had lodged a crim­i­nal li­bel com­plaint against Chun and pros­e­cu­tors took ac­tion against him.</p>
    <p>“Chun was aware of the he­li­copter shots fired,” the court said, adding that he alone bore the “main re­spon­si­bil­ity” for the ca­su­al­ties. It handed down an eight­month sus­pended sen­tence, well short of the 18-month cus­to­dial term sought by pros­e­cu­tors, with Yon­hap news agency quot­ing the judge as call­ing on him to “sin­cerely atone” for his deeds.</p>
    <p>Wear­ing a face mask and a black hat, Chun – who was not held in cus­tody dur­ing the trial – did not speak to re­porters as he left the court­room.</p>
    <p>Chun gov­erned South Korea with an iron fist dur­ing the 1980s. He over­saw the coun­try’s eco­nomic rise and won the right to host the 1988 Sum­mer Olympics, but also bru­tally re­pressed op­po­nents un­til mass demon­stra­tions forced him to ac­cept democ­racy.</p>
    <p>He was the coun­try’s first pres­i­dent to hand over power peace­fully, but re­mains among its most re­viled fig­ures.</p>
    <p>In 1996, he was con­victed of trea­son and con­demned to death, in part over what hap­pened at Gwangju, but his ex­e­cu­tion was com­muted on ap­peal and he was re­leased fol­low­ing a pres­i­den­tial par­don.</p>
    <p>All four of South Korea’s liv­ing for­mer pres­i­dents are ei­ther in prison or have served jail terms.</p>
