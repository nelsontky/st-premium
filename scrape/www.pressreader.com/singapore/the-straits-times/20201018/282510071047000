    <p>Re­trench­ments in Sin­ga­pore have more than tripled in the sec­ond quar­ter of this year, ver­sus the same pe­riod last year. The re­trench­ment wave is not slow­ing down and will likely take many more jobs in the quar­ters ahead.</p>
    <p>If you are aged over 50 in the United States, there is more than a one in two chance that you will be fired be­fore you are ready to re­tire, ac­cord­ing to an in­ves­tiga­tive re­port by the in­de­pen­dent news site Propublica and Wash­ing­ton think-tank The Ur­ban In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Fast Com­pany magazine, 75 per cent of ven­ture-backed start-ups fail.</p>
    <p>The start-up sec­tor that Sin­ga­pore is pro­mot­ing is an in­her­ently high-risk one, with many start-ups end­ing in fail­ure.</p>
    <p>The mar­riage fail­ure rate lo­cally is 30 per cent, based on fig­ures from Sin­ga­pore’s Depart­ment of Statis­tics. Last year saw 25,434 mar­riages and 7,623 di­vorces.</p>
    <p>Yet, de­spite how fail­ure sur­rounds us all to­day, Sin­ga­pore teenagers seem to ex­ces­sively fear it.</p>
    <p>The Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment’s (OECD) lat­est Pro­gramme for In­ter­na­tional Stu­dent As­sess­ment found that 72 per cent of 15-year-olds sur­veyed in Sin­ga­pore agree or strongly agree with wor­ry­ing about what oth­ers think of them when they fail. The score is one of the high­est in the world, in com­par­i­son with the OECD av­er­age of 56 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Sng Chern Wei, the</p>
    <p>Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion’s (MOE) deputy direc­tor-gen­eral of ed­u­ca­tion, was quoted in The Straits Times last year as say­ing that the re­sults sug­gest stu­dents are “wor­ried about not do­ing well in dif­fer­ent parts of school life, and wor­ried about how oth­ers view them when they ex­pe­ri­ence set­backs”. The min­istry ac­knowl­edged that an ex­ces­sive fear of fail­ing could be “dis­abling” and that it is mak­ing changes to dial back the ob­ses­sion with grades.</p>
    <p>How does this fear of fail­ure carry over into the work­force? Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and</p>
    <p>Fi­nance Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat touched on this in his Feb 18 Bud­get speech: “Some work­ers in their 40s and 50s have not seen any job or ca­reer changes since leav­ing school... But they are now fac­ing greater com­pe­ti­tion, from younger work­ers and work­ers over­seas. I un­der­stand their anx­i­ety.”</p>
    <p>He an­nounced bil­lions of dol­lars in bud­get sup­port to help work­ers reskill and re­train. While im­por­tant, this level of ex­pen­di­ture can­not be main­tained in­def­i­nitely.</p>
    <p>The con­cept of hav­ing a job for life is now a quaint no­tion of the past. Ac­cel­er­at­ing struc­tural and tech­nol­ogy shifts are im­pact­ing jobs and ev­ery facet of daily life – ren­der­ing jobs, ca­reers and in­dus­tries frag­ile and sub­ject to dis­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>With health­care ad­vance­ment, hu­mans are go­ing to live longer, turn­ing tra­di­tional no­tions of re­tire­ment sav­ings on their head, re­quir­ing work­ing adults to stay in the work­force longer.</p>
    <p>Hence, there is in­creased ur­gency to raise aware­ness in our pop­u­la­tion that reskilling and re­train­ing has to be­come the de­fault, and no longer just an op­tion. The foun­da­tions of such a mind­set should be laid be­fore work­ers en­ter the work­force.</p>
    <p>Given such eco­nomic volatil­ity and the high odds of fail­ure in var­i­ous as­pects of life , I would like to pro­pose that all schools of­fer a class on re­trench­ment and rein­ven­tion to stu­dents be­fore they leave sec­ondary school.</p>
    <p>As teens, much is chang­ing in their minds, bod­ies and friend­ships. Sim­i­lar to how ba­bies are in­oc­u­lated to pro­tect them against po­ten­tially dan­ger­ous child­hood dis­eases, hav­ing teens com­plete such a class could help to bet­ter pre­pare them for life af­ter school.</p>
    <p>What would teens learn in such a re­trench­ment and rein­ven­tion class? First, the class would de­mys­tify what ac­tu­ally hap­pens when some­one is re­trenched.</p>
    <p>Role play­ing would give them a sense of how a re­trench­ment is done and what it is like to be re­trenched.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, the class will ac­knowl­edge that it is a sad event, where one has to go through the five stages of grief: de­nial, anger, bar­gain­ing, de­pres­sion and ac­cep­tance. It would help them to un­der­stand that be­ing re­trenched is a func­tion of eco­nomic, com­pany, in­dus­try and fi­nan­cial con­sid­er­a­tions, and they shouldn’t take it per­son­ally.</p>
    <p>Teens go­ing through a hy­po­thet­i­cal re­trench­ment would be ad­vised to ad­just their per­sonal fi­nances and life­style, un­til a new job is se­cured.</p>
    <p>Third, the rein­ven­tion por­tion of the class would be­gin with teens be­ing taught how to as­sess their per­sonal skills and strengths. It would be fol­lowed by help­ing them dis­cover what is in de­mand in the mar­ket and where job op­por­tu­ni­ties lie, with the in­tent of fu­ture-proof­ing them against the dis­rup­tions that lie ahead.</p>
    <p>New York Times colum­nist Thomas Fried­man, fa­mous for best-sell­ing books such as The World Is Flat, gave this ad­vice to his teenage daugh­ters: “Al­ways think of your­self as if you need to be re-en­gi­neered, re­tooled, re­learned and re­taught con­stantly. Never think of your­self as fin­ished – oth­er­wise, you re­ally will be fin­ished.”</p>
    <p>If the course is ex­e­cuted well, it would help teens to un­der­stand what their par­ents may be go­ing through and help build men­tal re­silience to over­come fail­ure, way be­yond that of poor grades in school.</p>
    <p>A great by-prod­uct of such a class would be to help take away the stigma of re­trench­ment which con­tin­ues to dog us to­day.</p>
    <p>In some way, this class is sim­i­lar to those in South Korea, where stu­dents at­tend their own “pre­tend” fu­ner­als. The macabre rit­ual was con­ceived to help stu­dents ap­pre­ci­ate life and to re­duce the high sui­cide rate there.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants re­port that at­tend­ing their own “fu­ner­als” helps them to re­set their minds and ap­pre­ci­ate life more.</p>
    <p>The re­trench­ment and rein­ven­tion class has a sim­i­lar in­tent of re­set­ting the mind – but for jobs and men­tal flex­i­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>The MOE has laud­ably started a pro­gramme to of­fer cod­ing en­rich­ment classes to all up­per pri­mary stu­dents. While cod­ing is a crit­i­cal skill for the fu­ture, it is not a panacea for life­long em­ploy­ment. There is a real pos­si­bil­ity that ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) will take over rudi­men­tary cod­ing tasks.</p>
    <p>In my home, I talk fre­quently about re­trench­ment and rein­ven­tion with my two teenage sons. The whole rea­son I con­tinue liv­ing in a Hous­ing Board flat all these years is to keep costs low, in case my wife or my­self get re­trenched and need the fi­nan­cial run­way and time to rein­vent our­selves.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther of my sons would be sur­prised if ei­ther of us came home one day and said that we have been re­trenched, in the same way that I fully ex­pect to hear the same from my boys when they are out in the work­force in a few years’ time.</p>
    <p>Be­ing re­trenched is a rite of pas­sage that many in their gen­er­a­tion will go through. Rather than stag­nate and brood over why it hap­pened, I would like to see my sons bounce back and rein­vent them­selves.</p>
    <p>My ad­vice to them is to fo­cus on learn­ing new skills and to keep try­ing new things at any age. In ad­di­tion, I of­ten en­cour­age them to do com­mon things un­com­monly well, or un­com­mon things com­monly well.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, if the boys are learn­ing how to pro­gramme in Python, which is fast be­com­ing com­mon, I tell them to try to think of how they can use the pro­gram­ming lan­guage dif­fer­ently from how oth­ers are us­ing it, so that they stand out in a job interview or a hackathon.</p>
    <p>Or if they are learn­ing some­thing un­com­mon like knife forg­ing, I en­cour­age them to fig­ure out how the skill can be ap­pli­ca­ble to a com­mon com­mer­cial prob­lem, so that they can mon­e­tise the skill, should they need to.</p>
    <p>In some ways, I am con­duct­ing my own re­trench­ment and rein­ven­tion course at home, to con­tin­u­ously re­mind my boys to never think of them­selves as fin­ished – oth­er­wise, they will be fin­ished.</p>
