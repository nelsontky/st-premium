    <p>South African jockey Juan Paul van der Merwe has yet to land a fea­ture race at Kranji, but he goes into to­mor­row’s $250,000 Group 2 Merlion Tro­phy with the hope of break­ing the duck.</p>
    <p>All he is wish­ing for is that his mount, Sur­pass Nat­u­ral, can up­stage hot favourite Bold Thruster in the Poly­track 1,200m fea­ture.</p>
    <p>Bold Thruster, the high­est-rated of the nine con­tenders, looks hard to beat with his classy record of five Group 3 suc­cesses among his nine vic­to­ries.</p>
    <p>But van der Merwe knows his mount is also in daz­zling form.</p>
    <p>All he needs is some fur­ther progress from his last-start win­ner to give the much-vaunted favourite a run for the money.</p>
    <p>Trained by Leti­cia Dragon, Sur­pass Nat­u­ral is a horse with a fu­ture.</p>
    <p>The pro­lific sprinter’s record of six wins from nine starts, in­clud­ing his first five in a row, is tes­ta­ment to that.</p>
    <p>Re­turn­ing from the Covid-19-en­forced break on July 26, the fiveyear-old bounced straight back from three Group 3 de­feats to score in a Class 2 race over the Poly­track 1,100m in fine fash­ion.</p>
    <p>He de­fied a four-wide trip, clap­ping on the hot early sec­tion­als to clear out for an im­pres­sive one­length win.</p>
    <p>In the irons for the sec­ond time – the first re­sult­ing in a sev­enth plac­ing in the New Year Cup – van der Merwe felt the full rush of that rous­ing win.</p>
    <p>“He re­ally won a cracker last time out,” said the light­weight jockey, who is en­joy­ing his sec­ond sea­son in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He needs only two win­ners to equal last year’s 14-win­ner tally, with a few more months to go and los­ing three months dur­ing the rac­ing shut­down.</p>
    <p>“Bold Thruster is the favourite and will be dif­fi­cult to beat,” he added.</p>
    <p>“But my horse is well, his work has been good, even if we’ve just kept him tick­ing over.</p>
    <p>“But he will have to re­pro­duce that form at his last start to be com­pet­i­tive.”</p>
    <p>The jockey knows too well that on hand­i­cap, Sur­pass Nat­u­ral will have the dis­ad­van­tage, but just hopes that his mount can come into his own on race day.</p>
    <p>With Bold Thruster rated at 107 and Sur­pass Nat­u­ral at 91, there is a dif­fer­ence of 16 points.</p>
    <p>This equates to 8kg on hand­i­cap­ping terms. But the weight-for-age con­di­tions of the race pit all run­ners level at 57.5kg.</p>
    <p>Van der Merwe knows his horse is rar­ing to go and, if that is still not enough, then he will have to re­ally “sur­pass” him­self.</p>
    <p>One good thing is that Sur­pass Nat­u­ral has drawn bet­ter than Bold Thruster – in Gate 5, com­pared to Gate 9.</p>
    <p>So van der Merwe has a mind to make full use of the way the cards have been dealt.</p>
    <p>“Bold Thruster is quick, so is my horse. We have drawn bet­ter and I hope Bold Thruster will have to work a bit harder to go for­ward,” said van der Merwe, a win­ner of the Grade 1 J&B Met in 2016 with long shot Smart Call back home.</p>
    <p>A win to­mor­row will earn the 29-year-old his first Group suc­cess in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>READY TO GO</p>
    <p>Bold Thruster is quick, so is my horse. We have drawn bet­ter and I hope Bold Thruster will have to work a bit harder to go for­ward. ’’</p>
