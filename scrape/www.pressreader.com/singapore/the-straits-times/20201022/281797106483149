    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US De­fence Sec­re­tary Mark Esper has re­vealed a fresh drive to strengthen Amer­i­can al­liances with “like-minded democ­ra­cies”, in part through arms sales, in an ef­fort to curb the global in­flu­ence of Rus­sia and China.</p>
    <p>Mr Esper said the Pen­tagon would sys­tem­at­i­cally mon­i­tor and man­age its re­la­tion­ships with part­ner coun­tries, aim­ing to find ways to co­or­di­nate mil­i­taries and also to ad­vance US arms sales.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive, called the Guid­ance for De­vel­op­ment for Al­liances and Part­ner­ships (GDAP), comes just two weeks be­fore the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion that, if Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump loses, could see Mr Esper re­placed in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>It also comes af­ter nearly four years of Mr Trump’s ef­forts to re­struc­ture and even dis­man­tle al­liances, in­clud­ing Nato.</p>
    <p>“Amer­ica’s net­work of al­lies and part­ners pro­vides us an asym­met­ric ad­van­tage our ad­ver­saries can­not match,” Mr Esper said on Tues­day, call­ing the net­work “the back­bone of the in­ter­na­tional rules­based or­der”. He added that “China and Rus­sia probably have fewer than 10 al­lies com­bined”.</p>
    <p>He said China uses co­er­cion and fi­nan­cial en­trap­ment to build its al­liances with weak coun­tries such as Myan­mar, Cam­bo­dia and Laos.</p>
    <p>“The smaller the na­tion and the greater its needs, the heav­ier the pres­sure from Bei­jing,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Esper cited vis­its he has made to build de­fence re­la­tions with Malta, Mon­go­lia and Palau, as well as US plans for a greater de­fence pres­ence in Eastern Europe, in­clud­ing bas­ing troops in Poland.</p>
    <p>And he un­der­scored the need to build closer ties to “like-minded democ­ra­cies such as In­dia and In­done­sia”, adding that “they all recog­nise what China is do­ing”.</p>
    <p>A key part of this ef­fort is to ex­pand US arms sales, to both help al­lies im­prove de­fence ca­pa­bil­i­ties and to bol­ster the US de­fence in­dus­try against com­pe­ti­tion from Moscow and Bei­jing, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Esper said he has taken steps to ease re­stric­tions on ex­ports of “crit­i­cal” weapons sys­tems and speed up ap­provals, and will use the GDAP to iden­tify arms sales op­por­tu­ni­ties and pro­tect US mar­kets.</p>
    <p>He cited as an ex­am­ple the re­cent re­lax­ation of US re­stric­tions on the ex­port of bat­tle­field drones, which the US could sell to Tai­wan and the United Arab Emi­rates.</p>
    <p>Mr Esper’s an­nounce­ment is a “strate­gic mis­cal­cu­la­tion” which seeks to por­tray China “as an op­po­nent”, Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian told re­porters in Bei­jing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>China and the United States have locked horns over trade, hu­man rights and China’s grow­ing global tech am­bi­tions in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>China’s For­eign Min­istry yes­ter­day also ac­cused Wash­ing­ton of ar­bi­trar­ily ha­rass­ing Chi­nese stu­dents in the US. Nearly 300 Chi­nese stu­dents leav­ing the US have been ques­tioned at Amer­i­can air­ports from May to Septem­ber and some of their elec­tronic de­vices had been con­fis­cated, Mr Zhao said.</p>
