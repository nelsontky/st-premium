    <p>My grand­fa­ther passed away re­cently at the age of 98. He had a sweet tooth and loved a tall glass of beer, an in­dul­gence I en­cour­aged de­spite my rel­a­tives’ ob­jec­tions.</p>
    <p>We were half­way across the world from each other – I live in Europe and he in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>I wish we had the chance to en­joy a beer or hot toddy over Skype. I would have loved to see his tooth­less gig­gle as we gan bei (Man­darin for bot­toms up), and he would have rel­ished the stun­ning views of the Swiss Alps be­hind me.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, in these times, it is not un­usual for friends and fam­ily – sep­a­rated by lim­its on so­cial in­ter­ac­tions and bar clo­sures – to con­nect on­line over a drink or two.</p>
    <p>In­deed, the coro­n­avirus has trig­gered the rise of vir­tual happy hours – hosted over Zoom, Skype and FaceTime.</p>
    <p>Life is so much eas­ier in py­ja­mas and drinks like cock­tails can be recre­ated at home with lit­tle fuss, un­like sour­dough bread and burnt cheese­cakes.</p>
    <p>While I scoffed at the idea of an on­line drink­ing ses­sion ini­tially, I have come to ap­pre­ci­ate that it is a chance to stay con­nected and also share travel ex­pe­ri­ences with friends who may not be as for­tu­nate as I am to be able to drink in world cul­tures on a reg­u­lar ba­sis.</p>
    <p>Cock­tails are easy to fall in love with. I en­joy sip­ping a Saz­erac – a bour­bon or whiskey cock­tail that orig­i­nated in New Or­leans – at the Roo­sevelt Ho­tel in the south­ern Amer­i­can city.</p>
    <p>When I am in Oslo, Nor­way, I head to high-end cock­tail bar Sva­nen, where more than 80 per cent of the spir­its are made in-house and all its cock­tails are made with the coun­try’s nat­u­ral in­gre­di­ents, such as cloud­ber­ries, sea­weed and rowan berries.</p>
    <p>For now, with many so­cial and travel re­stric­tions still in place, a Zoom drink­ing party will have to do. Here are some pop­u­lar cock­tails from around the world you can eas­ily shake up at home.</p>
    <p>VODKA, RUS­SIA AND RUM, JA­MAICA</p>
    <p>Shaken, not stirred. Is there a more iconic cock­tail than 007’s favourite drink?</p>
    <p>There are a mil­lion places to sip a mar­tini, but if you want to do it the right way, head to where it all started – Ja­maica. Also visit James Bond au­thor Ian Flem­ing’s es­tate, Gold­enEye, where he penned 13 books.</p>
    <p>On my tours of the pri­vate vil­las, I lounged in the cot­tages and sun­bathed in the beach huts, quench­ing my thirst with Ja­maican rum and fresh co­conuts.</p>
    <p>In Hong Kong, DarkSide bar at the Rose­wood ho­tel puts a spin on the clas­sic mar­tini (right) with a wakamomo, a small Ja­panese peach, in place of the green olive.</p>
    <p>Noor, a cock­tail bar in Moscow, has a sig­na­ture Noor Tini worth check­ing out.</p>
    <p>Shake it up: Noor Tini: Vodka, ver­mouth, olive. Shaken, not stirred.</p>
    <p>COGNAC, FRANCE</p>
    <p>The Nou­velle-Aquitaine re­gion of France is known for many things – Bordeaux wine, Perig­ord truf­fles and 720km of At­lantic coast­line of­fer­ing a bounty of great seafood.</p>
    <p>For brandy lovers, Cognac in Char­ente is a must-visit, where famed Cognac houses are dot­ted among cas­tles.</p>
    <p>Remy Martin of­fers a va­ri­ety of tours in­clud­ing a gourmet and cock­tail cre­ation tour. The old­est, 300-year-old Martell Cognac House has an art mu­seum, cel­lar tours and a rooftop cock­tail bar, Indigo.</p>
    <p>The lively Bar Louise (right), the first Cognac cock­tail bar in the re­gion, is a good in­tro­duc­tion for those who want to learn about and sam­ple lo­cal co­gnacs.</p>
    <p>Shake it up: Side­car: 2 parts cognac, 1 part each Coin­treau and le­mon juice. Shake and serve.</p>
    <p>CAMPARI, ITALY</p>
    <p>Noth­ing says Ital­ian sum­mer more than sit­ting by the sea­side and sip­ping a cock­tail made with Campari (right) – the liquor pro­duced in North­ern Italy and adored by the en­tire coun­try.</p>
    <p>It is el­e­gant and a palate opener, and Euro­peans love it for its sim­plic­ity. It can be added to soda or cham­pagne to make a spritz, or paired with gin and ver­mouth for a Ne­groni.</p>
    <p>Strong, bit­ter­sweet and very much Ital­ian in all its char­ac­ter­is­tics, the bright red aper­i­tif is used to make cock­tails like the Boule­vardier and Amer­i­cano – two drinks which de­fined happy hour in the 1920s.</p>
    <p>In the city of No­vara where it was in­vented, 049 bar and my favourite Can­navac­ci­uolo Cafe & Bistrot make great drinks with Campari.</p>
    <p>Shake it up: Campari and soda: 1 part Campari, 3 parts soda, a slice of or­ange to gar­nish.</p>
    <p>TEQUILA, MEX­ICO</p>
    <p>There are many sto­ries about who in­vented the mar­garita (right) – among them a so­cialite of the same name and a Ti­juana restau­rant owner Car­los Her­rera who wanted to please a picky guest.</p>
    <p>Just like the story be­hind the drink, there are hun­dreds of mar­garita vari­a­tions: tequila or mez­cal, or­ange liqueur or lime juice, crushed ice or not.</p>
    <p>But one thing is for sure, it must be served with salt on the rim of the glass and a wedge of lime to help heighten the taste of the tequila.</p>
    <p>I pre­fer a smokey flavour in my mar­garita, so I use mez­cal in­stead of tequila.</p>
    <p>Shake it up: Mar­garita: Mez­cal, lime juice, sweet­ener and Coin­treau. Shaken and served over ice.</p>
    <p>TAHITIAN RUM, TAHITI</p>
    <p>Maita’i roa ae! The term loosely trans­lates to “the best” in Tahitian and was what home­sick Tahi­tians screamed out in praise af­ter sip­pingthe Mai Tai (left ) in a bar in Oak­land, the United States, which claims to have in­vented the cock­tail.</p>
    <p>This cool, sum­mery drink has evolved (more su­gar, less rum) since it was born in the 1940s. It ap­par­ently con­sumed much of the world’s rum pro­duc­tion be­cause of its pop­u­lar­ity.</p>
    <p>Strongly as­so­ci­ated with a Tiki bar – or more fit­ting of an au­then­tic Poly­ne­sian set­ting of sun, beach and palm trees – an au­then­tic Mai Tai must have rum, Cu­ra­cao liqueur, orgeat syrup (al­mond will do too) and lime juice.</p>
    <p>Shake it up: Mai Tai: White and dark rum, or­ange Cu­ra­cao, orgeat syrup, lime juice.</p>
    <p>WHISKEY, IRE­LAND</p>
    <p>Whiskey, cof­fee and cream. The Ir­ish cof­fee (left) is the only cock­tail you need to warm the body and soul.</p>
    <p>His­to­ri­ans will tell you the drink dates back to 1943 in Foynes Port, Ire­land, when flights car­ry­ing diplo­mats, po­lit­i­cal fig­ures and Hol­ly­wood celebri­ties were de­layed. Weary trav­ellers were treated to the bar­tender’s cre­ation, which com­bined Ir­ish whiskey, Martell cognac, ten­saito (beet su­gar), cof­fee and cream.</p>
    <p>It would later be­come known as the Ir­ish cof­fee cock­tail, which can be found all around the world, in­clud­ing in The Buena Vista in San Fran­cisco and The Diplo­mat by John Nu­gent in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Shake it up: Ir­ish Whiskey: Martell VSOP, ten­saito, cof­fee and cold cream.</p>
    <p>BOUR­BON, UNITED STATES</p>
    <p>The state of Vir­ginia pro­duces some of the best oys­ters on the East Coast, but few know it is also home to many great dis­til­leries.</p>
    <p>Found­ing fa­thers Ge­orge Washington and Ben­jamin Franklin were Vir­ginian na­tives and loved a stiff drink. But it was the third US pres­i­dent Thomas Jef­fer­son who had a cock­tail named af­ter him – The Thomas Jef­fer­son Crim­son, cre­ated in Vir­ginia to cel­e­brate his love of pomegranat­es, which he planted at his plan­ta­tion Mon­ti­cello.</p>
    <p>An­other iconic cock­tail made with lo­cal Vir­ginian bour­bon is the Julep. The Tides Inn makes a mem­o­rable one us­ing bour­bon (left) from Vir­ginia’s old­est dis­tillery, A.Smith Bow­man Dis­tillery.</p>
    <p>Shake it up: Ginger Mint Julep: 57ml Tides Inn mint-in­fused bour­bon, 170ml ginger beer, a sprig of mint to gar­nish. Serve with ice cubes.</p>
