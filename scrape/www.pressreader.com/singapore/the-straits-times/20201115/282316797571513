    <p>Celebrity cou­ple Dar­ren Lim and Eve­lyn Tan lived on their boat with their four chil­dren for four years, mov­ing back to land only in 2016 so their el­dest child Kris­ten could pre­pare for the Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>But the sea still beck­ons. So, when their daugh­ter turns 20 in five years, the cou­ple plan to move back to a boat, but it will just be the two of them.</p>
    <p>Then, Lim says, Kris­ten will be old enough to take care of the house­hold on land. To­day, the fam­ily calls a con­do­minium in Up­per Changi home.</p>
    <p>Lim’s pas­sion for sail­ing turned into a steady stream of rev­enue when Covid-19 scup­pered his film­ing gigs that would have taken him to coun­tries such as Rwanda and Egypt.</p>
    <p>The 48-year-old ac­tor-host’s 500 sq ft, three-room La­goon 400S2 cata­ma­ran is among the boats for char­ter at Xim­ula Sail, which has seen a surge in de­mand dur­ing the pandemic.</p>
    <p>Char­ters are fully booked al­most ev­ery week­end till the end of the year.</p>
    <p>Lim, who has been a co-owner and di­rec­tor of the com­pany since 2017, says: “The cir­cuit breaker was the long­est pe­riod of my adult life that I’d been stuck at home – I didn’t travel for more than two months.”</p>
    <p>On the film­ing front, things are slowly pick­ing up, says Lim, who joined show business in the mid-1990s and has acted in dra­mas like The Lit­tle Ny­onya (2008). He is now work­ing on a Man­darin show, Fixer, which spot­lights so­cial is­sues.</p>
    <p>While his over­seas work is still grounded, he is bring­ing in in­come at sea.</p>
    <p>Xim­ula Sail of­fers ex­pe­ri­ences – such as a four-hour trip (from $1,000+) to the South­ern is­lands; and a three-day, two-night sail­ing hol­i­day ($7,500+) to Pu­lau Hantu, Lazarus Is­land, Pu­lau Ubin and Sele­tar Is­land ar­eas. The boats are cap­tained by var­i­ous peo­ple, in­clud­ing Lim when his sched­ule per­mits.</p>
    <p>“Act­ing is my job, but boat­ing is my life,” Lim says, speak­ing to The Sun­day Times on board his cata­ma­ran, named Grace­fully, at the One15 Ma­rina in Sen­tosa Cove.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, his 46-year-old wife, who has a math­e­mat­ics de­gree from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, home­schools their three el­dest chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Kris­ten, 15, and Jairus, 13, fol­low a home­school­ing cur­ricu­lum called Clas­si­cal Con­ver­sa­tions, which im­parts a Chris­tian world­view, and are work­ing to­wards get­ting their high school di­ploma, which is equiv­a­lent to an A-level cer­tifi­cate.</p>
    <p>Jairus and Way, 11, have dys­lexia. Be­cause they re­quire more at­ten­tion, the youngest – seven-yearold El­liott – goes to a main­stream pri­mary school.</p>
    <p>It has not been easy, Tan ad­mits. “Some­times our ex­pec­ta­tions can turn into bur­dens for peo­ple who are wired dif­fer­ently.</p>
    <p>“I con­stantly have that strug­gle: Am I push­ing them hard enough? When is it too much, and when do I step back and say, that’s okay, be­cause you’ve done your best?”</p>
    <p>She com­pleted a course at the Dys­lexia As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore where she learnt about the Or­tonGilling­ham ap­proach, which is de­signed to help strug­gling read­ers.</p>
    <p>Home­school­ing does not mean no tu­ition. The three el­dest chil­dren at­tend Man­darin en­rich­ment classes.</p>
    <p>Tan, now a part-time artiste, con­cedes: “When we speak to them in ‘Chan­nel 8’, it comes back in ‘Chan­nel 5’.”</p>
    <p>While their kids’ ed­u­ca­tion is a pri­or­ity now, a life on the wa­ter re­mains at the back of the cou­ple’s minds.</p>
    <p>Lim’s love for the sea runs deep. He learnt to scuba dive in his teens, and, in his mid-20s, bought his first boat off eBay – an $800 dinghy with an out­board mo­tor. It was so old, he re­calls, that it oozed “juices” and fell apart after two years.</p>
    <p>His sec­ond boat, Ivy And Ah Hock, was named after the love­birds he and Tan played in the 1998 tele­vi­sion adap­ta­tion of Dick Lee and Michael Chi­ang’s mu­si­cal Beauty World. The cou­ple wed in 2004.</p>
    <p>Liv­ing on the wa­ter has al­ways been Lim’s dream. It took him 10 years to con­vince Tan to take the plunge. She was wor­ried about the po­ten­tial dan­gers. What if the kids fell over­board?</p>
    <p>But Lim per­sisted.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery night, I would be on the In­ter­net, show­ing her what other peo­ple were do­ing – some were home­school­ing (their chil­dren) while sail­ing around the world.”</p>
    <p>In mid-2011, they moved into a two-room Beneteau Ocea­nis 37 mono­hull, where they lived for 11 months be­fore up­grad­ing to their present boat, which cost $700,000.</p>
    <p>They rented out their condo when they were on the boat, which was docked in Sen­tosa most of the time, but also sailed to neigh­bour­ing coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The chil­dren – Tan gave birth to El­liott in November 2013 – learnt to take re­spon­si­bil­ity for their own safety.</p>
    <p>Lim says: “I told them, if you fall over­board, es­pe­cially on a stormy night, the chances of me sav­ing you are zero. I’ve had night­mares about such ac­ci­dents.”</p>
    <p>He re­calls a big storm in the Gulf of Thai­land: “It hap­pened in less than a minute – from zero wind to 160kmh and I had never seen such black thun­der­clouds be­fore.”</p>
    <p>Tan, who used to get sea­sick of­ten be­fore she found her sea legs, says her hus­band’s zest for pur­su­ing his pas­sion is partly what at­tracted her to him in the first place.</p>
    <p>“Some­times I think I for­get to play,” she says with a laugh.</p>
    <p>“I mar­ried some­one who knew how to play and takes me along on his ad­ven­tures.”</p>
    <p>It took Lim – Tan calls him an “am­phib­ian” – more than six months to get used to life on land again. “I lit­er­ally had sleep­less nights,” he says.</p>
    <p>And he pines for the life at sea. “My kids can stay in the house, and I’ll leave with my wife. They will look after them­selves and be in­de­pen­dent,” he says of his fu­ture plans.</p>
    <p>But what does Kris­ten think about her par­ents’ in­ten­tions to take off with­out them?</p>
    <p>“It’s an in­ter­est­ing prospect,” she says with a laugh.</p>
    <p>“I do love my broth­ers and love to spend time with them. So be­ing to­gether in a house­hold, pos­si­bly with­out our par­ents, we can make that work.”</p>
