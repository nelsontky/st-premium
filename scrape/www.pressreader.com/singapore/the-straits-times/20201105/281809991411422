    <p>VI­ENNA/ANKARA • Two men of Turk­ish de­scent said they helped save a po­lice of­fi­cer and two women dur­ing the deadly gun at­tack in Vi­enna, ac­tions the Turk­ish gov­ern­ment on Tues­day de­scribed as heroic.</p>
    <p>“He was ly­ing on the ground and we ran over in a zigzag fash­ion,” Mr Mikail Ozen, a per­sonal trainer and mixed mar­tial arts fighter, told jour­nal­ists, point­ing to the place he and his friend Re­cep Tayyip Gul­tekin said the po­lice of­fi­cer had lain.</p>
    <p>He said two other po­lice of­fi­cers urged them to stay back for their own safety, dur­ing what Austria’s gov­ern­ment de­scribed as an Is­lamist ter­ror­ist at­tack i n which four peo­ple were killed.</p>
    <p>But he said they walked over and helped carry the in­jured of­fi­cer to an am­bu­lance.</p>
    <p>Mr Ozen said: “If the same thing were to hap­pen again to­day, I would do the ex­act same thing with­out a sec­ond thought. Be­cause we live in Austria, we stand with Austria.”</p>
    <p>Aus­trian In­te­rior Min­is­ter Karl Ne­ham­mer, at a news con­fer­ence, said: “It’s im­por­tant for me to men­tion that the in­jured po­lice of­fi­cer was brought to safety by two Aus­tri­ans with an im­mi­gra­tion back­ground.” He did not name them. Mr Gul­tekin told Turk­ish me­dia that he and Mr Ozen were in Vi­enna city cen­tre when they heard gun­shots and saw a gun­man shoot­ing a passer-by.</p>
    <p>“After I car­ried the wounded woman to a nearby res­tau­rant, the ter­ror­ist pointed his gun at me,” Mr Gul­tekin said, adding that he threw him­self to the ground and hurt his leg.</p>
    <p>He said they then went to the near­est po­lice sta­tion to re­port the in­ci­dent and helped an el­derly woman to safety.</p>
    <p>The men’s ac­tions drew praise from Turk­ish For­eign Min­is­ter Mevlut Cavusoglu, whose coun­try’s re­la­tions with Austria have been strained in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>“Last night there were two he­roes in #Vi­enna. Re­cep Tayyip and Mikail did what a true Turk and Mus­lim is ex­pected to do! Thank you, young men. WE ARE PROUD OF YOU!” he wrote on Twitter.</p>
    <p>He later told the me­dia he con­veyed Ankara’s con­do­lences to Austria and re­peated his praise for the men.</p>
    <p>AC­TIONS DRAW PRAISE</p>
    <p>Last night there were two he­roes in #Vi­enna. Re­cep Tayyip and Mikail did what a true Turk and Mus­lim is ex­pected to do! Thank you, young men. WE ARE PROUD OF YOU!</p>
