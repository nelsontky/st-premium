    <p>There are hardly any med­i­cal or life poli­cies avail­able to peo­ple with autism or Down syn­drome in Sin­ga­pore. This seg­ment of the pop­u­la­tion is just as sus­cep­ti­ble to age­ing and dis­eases as the rest. With­out in­sur­ance cov­er­age, they may add to the cost and bur­den borne by so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>As this group of peo­ple age and face health is­sues, and if they can­not af­ford even av­er­age health­care, then the state may have to step in with sub­si­dies and grants for their up­keep and med­i­cal needs.</p>
    <p>Presently, the in­sur­ance land­scape is a maze for those with autism and their care­givers.</p>
    <p>Mr Wes­ley Loh de­scribed how openly autis­tic peo­ple with low sup­port needs can face ex­clu­sion on the to­tal per­ma­nent dis­abil­ity cov­er­age un­der the De­pen­dants’ Pro­tec­tion Scheme (Govt help needed to tackle in­surer bias against autism, Sept 17).</p>
    <p>While we ad­vo­cate the in­clu­sion of peo­ple with spe­cial needs in our so­ci­ety and work­force, we do not seem to pro­vide ad­e­quate cov­er­age for them, un­like what is read­ily avail­able to work­ing peo­ple with no spe­cial needs.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment and the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore said they are build­ing a set of guide­lines for pri­vate in­sur­ers, un­der which in­sur­ers should not treat peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties dif­fer­ently from those with­out, un­less such dif­fer­ences can be jus­ti­fied (In­sur­ers ex­pected to deal fairly with all clients, in­clud­ing those with dis­abil­i­ties, Oct 7).</p>
    <p>I hope it will be a com­pre­hen­sive frame­work that can­not be eas­ily com­pro­mised.</p>
    <p>Like Ms Rowena Chan Lian Wah (Only laws can en­sure that those with autism get in­sur­ance cover, Oct 23), I think it is time for Sin­ga­pore to leg­is­late equal ac­cess to health­care and ad­e­quate in­sur­ance cov­er­age for its cit­i­zens with spe­cial needs.</p>
