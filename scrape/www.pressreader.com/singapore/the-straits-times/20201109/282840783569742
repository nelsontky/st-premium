    <p>Pow­er­house South Korean boy band BTS’ rap­per Suga will be tak­ing a break from all of­fi­cial ac­tiv­i­ties for the time be­ing to re­cover from shoul­der surgery.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Yon­hap news agency, the septet’s man­age­ment agency Big Hit En­ter­tain­ment said in a state­ment on Fri­day that the 27-year-old star, whose real name is Min Yoon-gi, “un­der­went surgery to re­pair his torn shoul­der labrum” last Tues­day.</p>
    <p>His agency added that he opted for surgery “to re­store him­self to good health to pre­pare for his manda­tory mil­i­tary ser­vice as well as his post-ser­vice mu­si­cal ca­reer”.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing South Korean en­ter­tain­ment news por­tal Soompi, the star said in a mes­sage to fans that his surgery went well and that he would be back on­stage soon.</p>
    <p>He said: “Since I per­form as part of my job, I tried to avoid the surgery as much as I could and en­dured with re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion and shots. How­ever, I was afraid be­cause it kept get­ting worse when­ever I had to per­form.”</p>
    <p>Suga has had is­sues with his left shoul­der for sev­eral years, since he was in­volved in a traf­fic ac­ci­dent in 2012 while work­ing as a part-time de­liv­ery driver be­fore his boy band de­but.</p>
    <p>He has made ref­er­ences to his in­jury in his mu­sic be­fore, such as in his solo song First Love (2016), where the lyrics men­tion his “crushed shoul­der”.</p>
    <p>BTS will be em­bark­ing on pro­mo­tions for their next al­bum, BE, slated for re­lease on Nov 20. But Big Hit En­ter­tain­ment said Suga may be ab­sent from the up­com­ing ac­tiv­i­ties so that he can heal and rest.</p>
