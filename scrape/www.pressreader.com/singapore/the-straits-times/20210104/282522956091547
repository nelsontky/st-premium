    <p>• Ar­se­nal is a clas­sic case of how quickly things can turn around in foot­ball.</p>
    <p>Just two weeks ago, the talk was that the Gun­ners were em­broiled in a rel­e­ga­tion bat­tle, with man­ager Mikel Arteta a dead man walk­ing af­ter their worst top-flight start to a sea­son since 1974-75.</p>
    <p>Three Pre­mier League wins on the bounce, how­ever, has not only quelled the sack ru­mours but also filled the fans with hope that the club can now make a con­certed push for the top six and more.</p>
    <p>De­spite Ar­se­nal’s aw­ful start, there is only a six-point dif­fer­ence be­tween them and Tot­ten­ham, who are in the top four on 29 points.</p>
    <p>Arteta is also con­vinced that the prospects for their sea­son are now “com­pletely dif­fer­ent” af­ter thrash­ing West Bromwich Al­bion 4-0 away on Satur­day, pick­ing up nine points in eight days.</p>
    <p>“I’m so happy we were able to achieve the tar­get that we had be­cause the ta­ble looks com­pletely dif­fer­ent,” said the Spa­niard, who had found his job un­der threat just four months af­ter win­ning the FA Cup. “The en­ergy we have around the place is much bet­ter and wins bring a lot of con­fi­dence. You can see that to­day in the way the team played.”</p>
    <p>Kieran Tier­ney got the ball rolling, cut­ting in from the left flank and fir­ing home his sec­ond goal for Ar­se­nal be­fore 19-year-old winger Bukayo Saka fin­ished off a su­perb team ef­fort be­fore the break to dou­ble their ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>Alexan­dre La­cazette, the team’s top scorer this term, then struck twice in the sec­ond half and with the pres­sure off, con­fi­dence is seep­ing back into the team.</p>
    <p>“I think pre­vi­ously we lost games that we were re­ally un­lucky in and most of them was our own fault, be­cause we made some er­rors and lacked some dis­ci­pline,” the French­man told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“But ob­vi­ously, you need to win foot­ball matches and now this brings a dif­fer­ent mo­men­tum, the play­ers they get the hand­brake off and you can see that they are more free to play. This is an Ar­se­nal team with the idea that I want.”</p>
    <p>Arteta also re­vealed the im­mi­nent re­turn to fit­ness of Ghana mid­fielder Thomas Partey, who has missed the last six league games ow­ing to in­jury, would pro­vide a huge boost.</p>
    <p>On their £45 mil­lion (S$80.2 mil­lion) dead­line-day sign­ing, who has only made four starts in the league so far, he added: “We’ve been missing him.</p>
    <p>“He brings some­thing dif­fer­ent to the team. He’s a player with an enor­mous tal­ent, but as well some­one who can trans­form the team the way we want.</p>
    <p>“He is feel­ing good. He needs an­other two or three good ses­sions to see if he is 100 per cent avail­able to play. If that is the case, great news for us.”</p>
