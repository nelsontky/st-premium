    <p>• The Covid-19 pan­demic has pushed schools all over the world to go on­line as new waves of in­fec­tion keep emerg­ing.</p>
    <p>In In­dia, a coun­try where the gaps in ac­cess to ed­u­ca­tion and the In­ter­net were al­ready vast, poor fam­i­lies are strug­gling to stay the course.</p>
    <p>Shirin Riyaz Shah, 15, at­tends a small pri­vate school in Mum­bai. There is one smart­phone be­tween her and her four sib­lings over which they sit through Zoom lessons and sub­mit home­work via What­sApp.</p>
    <p>Their sched­ules do not blend neatly, and there is a con­stant tus­sle over the phone.</p>
    <p>Data is es­pe­cially pre­cious be­cause money, al­ways tight, is now in even shorter sup­ply as the pan­demic stretches her fam­ily’s sin­gle in­come. Her father is a tai­lor and for now, move­ment re­stric­tions mean he is mostly home. When that changes, so will the chil­dren’s ac­cess to his phone.</p>
    <p>And dig­i­tal class­rooms make the process of learn­ing harder.</p>
    <p>“In class, we can raise our hands over and over again and it isn’t a prob­lem,” Shirin said by phone. “We can ask teach­ers to pause in a class and then ask them to re­peat. But in a video call, if two or three stu­dents do this, then time will run out.”</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has led to the “big­gest global ed­u­ca­tion emer­gency of our life­time”, ac­cord­ing to a re­port by the Save The Chil­dren Fund.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, lock­downs en­forced to stop the spread of the coro­n­avirus have put 91 per cent of learn­ers out of school. Of these, the poor­est and most marginalis­ed chil­dren are at high­est risk of never re­turn­ing to the class­room.</p>
    <p>In In­dia, where the gov­ern­ment spends about 3 per cent of the na­tion’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct on ed­u­ca­tion and only half the pop­u­la­tion has ac­cess to the In­ter­net, 320 mil­lion stu­dents have al­ready been af­fected, said Save The Chil­dren Fund.</p>
    <p>The spokesman for In­dia’s Min­istry for Hu­man Re­source De­vel­op­ment and the sec­re­tary of the School Ed­u­ca­tion and Lit­er­acy depart­ment did not re­spond to e-mails and phone calls ask­ing for com­ment.</p>
    <p>“You have one side of the pop­u­la­tion that is so used to tech, it is like a sec­ond lan­guage to them,” said Ms Shreya To­bias, a vol­un­teer with Teach for In­dia, a non-govern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion (NGO), who ed­u­cates fourth-grade chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Many of her pupils have never used phones be­fore, and their par­ents them­selves do not know enough to help. “These kids don’t have that. Tech is con­fus­ing for them,” she said.</p>
    <p>In­stead of in­no­vat­ing, gov­ern­ments and schools have gone for the easiest op­tion avail­able, said Pro­fes­sor Shan­tha Sinha, founder of the re­search in­sti­tute Mamidipudi Venkataran­gaiya Foun­da­tion and the for­mer head of the Na­tional Com­mis­sion for Pro­tec­tion of Child Rights. “It is show­ing a lack of sen­si­tiv­ity.”</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments must al­lo­cate funds to lo­cal vil­lage coun­cils and en­cour­age so­lu­tions from the bot­tom up, Prof Sinha said.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral rights groups and NGOs have taken this ap­proach – from read­ing rooms to dis­tribut­ing books di­rectly to homes – at­tempt­ing to fill the gaps left by on­line ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>A vil­lage in Jhark­hand has seen wide­spread fame for its use of loud­speak­ers perched on trees through which chil­dren can lis­ten to classes.</p>
    <p>But these ini­tia­tives need to be scaled up quickly, ex­perts say.</p>
    <p>Shirin is wor­ried, but de­ter­mined. “This is my aim, and this is my re­spon­si­bil­ity,” she said. “I will not let my fu­ture goals be dis­rupted by any­thing.”</p>
