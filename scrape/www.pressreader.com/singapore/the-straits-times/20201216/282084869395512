    <p>AS­SO­CIATE PRO­FES­SOR TAN NGIAP CHUAN, DI­REC­TOR OF RE­SEARCH AT SINGHEALTH POLY­CLIN­ICS, ON THE RE­MOTE MON­I­TOR­ING OF PA­TIENTS’ VI­TAL PA­RAM­E­TERS.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients with chronic health con­di­tions such as di­a­betes have shown in­creased will­ing­ness to take up tele­mon­i­tor­ing, a trend which is needed to help curb ris­ing mor­bid­ity and mor­tal­ity in Sin­ga­pore’s age­ing pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, its fea­si­bil­ity de­pends on the pa­tients’ pro-ac­tive­ness and their ac­cep­tance of com­mu­ni­ca­tion tech­nolo­gies for health­care ser­vices, said SingHealth Poly­clin­ics yes­ter­day, which is cur­rently re­cruit­ing more than 150 hyper­ten­sion pa­tients to test its ef­fec­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>Tele­mon­i­tor­ing in­volves re­mote mon­i­tor­ing of vi­tal pa­ram­e­ters of a pa­tient, such as blood pres­sure or blood sugar lev­els, out­side the health­care set­ting.</p>
    <p>SingHealth said it en­ables care providers to take prompt mea­sures to pre­vent com­pli­ca­tions that de­velop in be­tween vis­its, which may go un­no­ticed for pa­tients who rely solely on phys­i­cal con­sul­ta­tions for chronic dis­eases.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Tan Ngiap Chuan, di­rec­tor of re­search at SingHealth Poly­clin­ics, noted that tele­mon­i­tor­ing has had ben­e­fits amid the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“This model of care has brought con­ve­nience to many of our pa­tients, es­pe­cially dur­ing the Covid-19 pe­riod when we are advised to stay home,” said Prof Tan, who is also vice-chair­man of re­search at the SingHealth-Duke NUS Fam­ily Medicine Aca­demic Clin­i­cal Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>He said that with govern­ment agen­cies launch­ing tech­nol­ogy lit­er­acy pro­grammes, such as the Smart Na­tion Sin­ga­pore ini­tia­tive, more pa­tients could ac­cept and adopt com­mu­ni­ca­tion de­vices to man­age their health.</p>
    <p>To demon­strate the uptick in tele­mon­i­tor­ing, SingHealth cited two stud­ies it pre­vi­ously con­ducted.</p>
    <p>While re­search in 2009 showed that only 40 per cent of pa­tients were re­cep­tive to it, a 2017 study it con­ducted with the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine demon­strated that more than 52 per cent of pa­tients had “pos­i­tive per­cep­tion and at­ti­tude” to­wards tele­mon­i­tor­ing.</p>
    <p>The 2017 study in­volved 900 multi-eth­nic Asian pa­tients, be­tween the ages of 21 and 70, who were as­sessed at Pasir Ris and Sengkang poly­clin­ics. They had chronic con­di­tions such as Type 2 di­a­betes mel­li­tus and hyper­ten­sion.</p>
    <p>The pa­tients’ will­ing­ness to adopt tele­mon­i­tor­ing de­pended on their per­cep­tion to­wards their med­i­cal con­di­tions, tech­no­log­i­cal lit­er­acy and un­der­stand­ing of tele­mon­i­tor­ing care, said SingHealth, which has eight poly­clin­ics is­land­wide and has recorded more than 700,000 pa­tient vis­its for hyper­ten­sion and Type 2 di­a­betes mel­li­tus.</p>
    <p>Dr David Sin, who will be join­ing the SingHealth Fam­ily Medicine Res­i­dency next July, noted that pa­tients with­out any need for fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance were more will­ing to use tele­mon­i­tor­ing.</p>
    <p>Dr Sin, cur­rently a med­i­cal of­fi­cer with the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces, said: “In con­trast, pa­tients who set aside more time for poly­clinic vis­its, and those who had con­cerns re­gard­ing pri­vacy vi­o­la­tions were less will­ing to em­bark on this care model.”</p>
    <p>To fur­ther test the ef­fec­tive­ness of tele­mon­i­tor­ing on main­tain­ing a pa­tient’s health, a pilot pro­gramme for hyper­ten­sion pa­tients – called the Pri­mary Tech-En­hanced Care at Be­dok Poly­clinic – was launched on Sept 30.</p>
    <p>It has re­cruited close to 60 pa­tients to date.</p>
