    <p>MUM­BAI • Bol­ly­wood actress Rhea Chakrabort­y has been ar­rested for al­legedly buy­ing drugs for her for­mer boyfriend, ac­tor Sushant Singh Ra­jput, whose sui­cide sparked a me­dia storm in In­dia.</p>
    <p>Ra­jput, 34, was found dead in June in his Mum­bai apart­ment – with po­lice say­ing he took his own life.</p>
    <p>A star with many hit movies to his name, his sui­cide ini­tially trig­gered a de­bate over men­tal health in the multi­bil­lion-dol­lar in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>But Ra­jput’s fam­ily dis­puted re­ports that he suf­fered from de­pres­sion and ac­cused Chakrabort­y, 28, of steal­ing his money and ha­rass­ing him. She has strongly de­nied the al­le­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Chakrabort­y was ar­rested on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The po­lice have also de­tained oth­ers in con­nec­tion with the case in­clud­ing her brother and a mem­ber of Ra­jput’s house staff.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s top anti-crime agency, the Cen­tral Bu­reau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion, has been prob­ing his death since last month. The Nar­cotics Con­trol Bu­reau (NCB) was look­ing into the star’s con­sump­tion of cannabis.</p>
    <p>“We will be op­pos­ing bail pe­ti­tions” for all sus­pects, NCB di­rec­tor Mutha Ashok Jain told re­porters. The actress has been re­manded to ju­di­cial cus­tody un­til Sept 22.</p>
    <p>The in­ves­ti­ga­tion has grabbed head­lines for months, with the me­dia closely fol­low­ing the back-and­forth al­le­ga­tions be­tween Ra­jput’s fam­ily and Chakrabort­y.</p>
    <p>Some celebritie­s, in­clud­ing actress Sonam Kapoor and di­rec­tor Anurag Kashyap, ac­cused tele­vi­sion chan­nels of car­ry­ing out a “witch hunt” against Chakrabort­y.</p>
    <p>Born in the east­ern state of Bi­har, Ra­jput quit en­gi­neer­ing stud­ies to pur­sue a ca­reer in act­ing and dance.</p>
    <p>He got his big break in 2013 with Kai Po Che, a film about cricket, love and pol­i­tics that won ac­claim at the Ber­lin film fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>He was also lauded for his por­trayal of In­dian cricket hero Ma­hen­dra Singh Dhoni in the 2016 hit M.S. Dhoni: The Un­told Story.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with Agence France-Presse that year, Ra­jput spoke of the emo­tional roller­coaster he ex­pe­ri­enced while film­ing the movie, which por­trayed the heart­break suf­fered by Dhoni when the crick­eter’s girl­friend died.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter we did the prepa­ra­tion, in my head I was him and ev­ery­thing that was hap­pen­ing was ac­tu­ally af­fect­ing me,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ra­jput’s last film was a Hindi re­make of the Hol­ly­wood ro­mance The Fault In Our Stars (2014), ti­tled Dil Bechara (Poor Heart), which was re­leased in July.</p>
