    <p>Ms Yasmine Cheng has de­signed a “post­box” for grand­par­ents who are not tech-savvy to bond with their grand­chil­dren, one that puts a whole new spin on the phrase: “You’ve got mail.”</p>
    <p>Called Post, the com­pact, portable sys­tem com­prises a mail­box de­vice and an app wire­lessly hooked up to a smart­phone.</p>
    <p>“The mo­ti­va­tion for this is from per­sonal ex­pe­ri­ence,” says Ms Cheng, 24, one of 37 stu­dents grad­u­at­ing this year f rom the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) Divi­sion of In­dus­trial De­sign. Post is her fi­nal-year the­sis project.</p>
    <p>“My cousins and I live in a dif­fer­ent coun­try from my grand­par­ents. So I wanted to de­sign some­thing to bridge this gap de­spite the phys­i­cal dis­tance,” she says.</p>
    <p>The idea for Post came from a YouTube video about an el­derly woman wait­ing daily for the post­man, hop­ing to re­ceive let­ters from her chil­dren. Ms Cheng says: “I wanted to recre­ate this an­tic­i­pa­tion dur­ing the wait and the joy when one re­ceives a letter in the mail­box.”</p>
    <p>Her de­vice al­lows peo­ple to send so­cial me­dia posts as phys­i­cal pho­tos via a cloud sys­tem us­ing Zink print­ing tech­nol­ogy. The Zink – or “zero ink” – sys­tem dis­penses with ink car­tridges and re­lies on spe­cially coated pa­per to print smart­phone screen­shots into me­men­tos.</p>
    <p>Her work caught the eye of Th­e­seus Chan, founder of de­sign stu­dio Work and De­signer of the Year at the in­au­gu­ral Pres­i­dent’s De­sign Award in 2006.</p>
    <p>“I like Yasmine’s work as she em­braces a sense of play­ful­ness and naivete in her de­sign,” says Chan, 59, who has been called the “god­fa­ther” of Sin­ga­pore de­sign. “This emo­tive ap­peal is es­sen­tial as we seek to have pos­i­tiv­ity, com­fort and fa­mil­iar­ity with things around us.”</p>
    <p>For Ms Cheng and her class­mates, a ma­jor com­po­nent of their four-year hon­ours pro­gramme is close col­lab­o­ra­tion with in­dus­tries, pub­lic in­sti­tu­tions and gov­ern­ment agen­cies, for project op­por­tu­ni­ties with a high po­ten­tial for com­mer­cial de­vel­op­ment, to pre­pare them for real-world de­mand.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Chris­tian Boucharenc, head of NUS’ Divi­sion of In­dus­trial De­sign, says that since the es­tab­lish­ment of the pro­gramme 20 years ago, the team has been “con­tin­u­ously re­fin­ing its pro­gramme and col­lab­o­rat­ing with com­pa­nies from var­i­ous sec­tors through work­shops and stu­dio plat­forms”.</p>
    <p>One of the many cre­ative so­lu­tions from this year’s batch of in­dus­trial de­signs is an eco-friendly al­ter­na­tive to sty­ro­foam.</p>
    <p>Ms Seah Li Ping’s the­sis project is called For Durian, By Durian. Made from durian fi­bre and starch ex­tracted from the fruit’s rinds and seeds, the ma­te­rial is de­signed, iron­i­cally, to pack­age the thorny fruit.</p>
    <p>The 24-year-old lets on that she has been a durian lover since she was young and was “ex­tremely mo­ti­vated” to repur­pose durian waste. Up to 70 per cent of the fruit is its husk and seeds.</p>
    <p>“Durian seeds can also be used as a bin­der for durian fi­bres,” says Ms Seah, whose pack­ag­ing fea­tures cav­i­ties to pro­tect the fruit’s fleshy pulp as well as an in­ter­lock­ing sys­tem to hold ev­ery­thing to­gether nicely. “The de­sign al­lows for easy han­dling for both sell­ers and con­sumers.”</p>
    <p>For de­sign grad­u­ate Sher­win Ng, 24, see­ing be­yond the ev­ery­day de­sires of able-bod­ied peo­ple pro­vided the sub­stance for his fi­na­lyear the­sis project.</p>
    <p>His ex­er­cise sys­tem for para­plegics, called Adap­tix, is a home­based portable de­vice which fea­tures wheel­chair rollers for car­dio and mus­cle-strength­en­ing work­outs, and comes with mo­toras­sisted l eg ped­als for pas­sive­mo­tion ex­er­cises in the lower limbs.</p>
    <p>“As an avid road user, the life con­se­quences of road ac­ci­dents are al­ways at the back of my mind,” says Mr Ng. “Spinal cord in­jury is one of these con­se­quences and, through re­search, I re­alised that these vic­tims have unique needs that are of­ten over­looked by de­sign­ers. They do not have a sim­ple and ac­ces­si­ble method for keep­ing fit.”</p>
    <p>He de­vel­oped the Adap­tix sys­tem af­ter ex­ten­sive con­sul­ta­tions with para­plegics and phys­io­ther­a­pists.</p>
    <p>The de­sign took about nine months from idea to fin­ished de­sign con­cept, which also saw Mr Ng try­ing out a wheel­chair him­self to “un­der­stand many of the phys­i­cal and emo­tional pain points of wheel­chair users”.</p>
    <p>Apart from fir­ing the imag­i­na­tion and de­vel­op­ing strate­gic ap­proaches to de­sign, the Divi­sion of In­dus­trial De­sign also em­pha­sises in­dus­try col­lab­o­ra­tions on projects with com­mer­cial po­ten­tial.</p>
    <p>This year’s projects ran the gamut from health­care and re­tail to apps and ser­vice de­sign, but there were also trends of “so­cial de­sign” and go­ing back to Asian roots to wow a con­tem­po­rary world.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the divi­sion’s As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Christophe Gaubert, the Care­giv­ing101 project by Mr Shawn Ng is at the “fron­tier” of</p>
    <p>in­dus­trial de­sign, cor­re­spond­ing to an emer­gent trend in Europe called “so­cial de­sign”.</p>
    <p>“It mixes a multi-dis­ci­plinary ap­proach, co-de­sign with users, min­i­mal in­ter­ven­tion in terms of ma­te­ri­al­ity and col­lab­o­ra­tion with pub­lic au­thor­i­ties for the im­ple­men­ta­tion such as, in this case, the Na­tional Coun­cil of So­cial Ser­vice,” says Prof Gaubert, 47.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng’s Care­giv­ing101 is hinged on Solomon’s Para­dox – look­ing at one­self as a third party in the equa­tion – to main­tain dis­tance from one’s sit­u­a­tion for clar­ity and to re­solve strug­gles.</p>
    <p>An­other re­cent trend which Prof Gaubert ob­serves this year harks back to time-hon­oured cul­tural prac­tices to in­spire con­tem­po­rary works, such as Qi by Mr Ryan Chin and Wei! by Ms Sh­eryl Ang.</p>
    <p>Qi, which draws in­spi­ra­tion from the tra­di­tional Chi­nese prac­tice of taiji, is de­signed as a night light us­ing ex­ist­ing light from the smart­phone’s screen. It does this while keep­ing the de­vice at a dis­tance, to prompt users to find a bal­ance in a stress­ful daily life dom­i­nated by dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>Wei! is a de­sign tool that trans­lates taste into shapes, gen­er­at­ing table­ware such as plates and bowls that help peo­ple pick up the finer points about Chi­nese Diet Ther­apy. It em­bod­ies the tra­di­tional prac­tice of clas­si­fy­ing food in terms of flavours and tem­per­a­ture which is usu­ally passed down by word of mouth.</p>
    <p>Wei! and Care­giv­ing101 have been se­lected for fur­ther de­vel­op­ment, says Prof Gaubert.</p>
    <p>He adds: “These vi­sions of young de­sign­ers con­trib­ute to a quest for mean­ing, claim­ing roots while pro­ject­ing to­wards a mu­tat­ing fu­ture – un­de­ni­ably a re­mark­able con­tri­bu­tion to a grow­ing Sin­ga­porean cul­ture.”</p>
