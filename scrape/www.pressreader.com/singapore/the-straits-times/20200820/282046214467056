    <p>A lo­cal Mus­lim char­ity foun­da­tion and the Sin­ga­pore Red Cross have raised $152,530 for vic­tims of the re­cent mas­sive ex­plo­sion in Beirut, the Le­banese cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>The Rah­matan Lil Alamin Foun­da­tion (RLAF), which was set up by the Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore (Muis) in 2009, said in a state­ment yes­ter­day that the amount was raised in a fundrais­ing cam­paign be­tween Aug 7 and Aug 14.</p>
    <p>It noted that the amount was 10 times more than any­thing raised on­line pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>The foun­da­tion added that the funds will be de­liv­ered to the Le­banese Red Cross, which is cur­rently pro­vid­ing aid and as­sis­tance on the ground in Beirut.</p>
    <p>RLAF ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Zainul Abidin Ibrahim said there were ini­tial con­cerns that the stress brought about by Covid-19 would af­fect the fundrais­ing ef­fort, so he was heart­ened by the gen­er­ous con­tri­bu­tions from the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“I am very happy to say that the com­mu­nity has a deep sense of con­cern for oth­ers be­yond them­selves. That is a good sign, and that is the kind of so­ci­ety we want to build,” said Mr Zainul.</p>
    <p>The Madrasah Alju­nied Al-Is­lamiah ral­lied stu­dents, teach­ers and par­ents to do­nate and raised $10,000, said the RLAF.</p>
    <p>Un­like be­fore, lit­tle fundrais­ing ac­tiv­ity took place in mosques. Since they have not fully re­opened due to Covid-19, on­line plat­forms such as Giv­ing.sg, Mus­limSG and the RLAF web­site be­came av­enues for do­na­tions.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Red Cross sec­re­tary gen­eral and chief ex­ec­u­tive Ben­jamin Wil­liam said the blast “af­fected thou­sands and dis­rupted the provision of crit­i­cal ser­vices, which is made more ur­gent due to the pan­demic”.</p>
    <p>“It is crit­i­cal that we all come to­gether to ex­tend what­ever sup­port we can to en­hance the re­lief op­er­a­tions. This will also help fa­cil­i­tate a quick re­sump­tion of es­sen­tial med­i­cal ser­vices,” Mr Wil­liam said.</p>
