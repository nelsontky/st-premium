    <p>Not long af­ter the coronaviru­s first sur­faced last De­cem­ber, an am­bi­tious pre­dic­tion was made: A vac­cine would be avail­able within 12 to 18 months, and it would stop the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>De­spite se­ri­ous chal­lenges – how to mass man­u­fac­ture, sup­ply and de­liver a vac­cine world­wide – the first prong of that wish could well be ful­filled. Eight vac­cine can­di­dates are un­der­go­ing large-scale ef­fi­cacy tests, so-called phase three tri­als, and re­sults are ex­pected by the end of this year or early next year.</p>
    <p>But even if one, or more, of those ef­forts suc­ceeds, a vac­cine might not end the pan­demic. This is partly be­cause we seem to be fo­cused at the mo­ment on de­vel­op­ing the kind of vac­cine that may well pre­vent Covid-19 – the dis­ease – but that wouldn’t do enough to stop the trans­mis­sion of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors usu­ally ex­plain vac­cines to pa­tients and the par­ents of young chil­dren by de­scrib­ing how those pro­tect us from a par­tic­u­lar dis­ease: An at­ten­u­ated form of a pathogen, or just a bit of it, is in­oc­u­lated into the hu­man body in or­der to trig­ger its im­mune re­sponse; hav­ing learnt to fight off that pathogen once, the body will re­mem­ber how to fend off the dis­ease, should it be ex­posed to the same pathogen later.</p>
    <p>A vac­cine’s abil­ity to fore­stall a dis­ease is also how vac­cine de­vel­op­ers typ­i­cally de­sign – and how reg­u­la­tors typ­i­cally eval­u­ate – phase three clin­i­cal tri­als for vac­cine can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>Yet, the best vac­cines also serve an­other crit­i­cal func­tion: They block a pathogen’s trans­mis­sion from one per­son to an­other. And this re­sult, of­ten called an</p>
    <p>“indi­rect” ef­fect of vac­ci­na­tion, is no less im­por­tant than the di­rect ef­fect of pre­vent­ing the dis­ease caused by that pathogen. In fact, dur­ing a pan­demic, it prob­a­bly is even more im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>That’s what we should be fo­cus­ing on right now. And yet, we are not.</p>
    <p>Stop­ping a virus’ trans­mis­sion re­duces the en­tire pop­u­la­tion’s over­all ex­po­sure to the virus. It pro­tects peo­ple who may be too frail to re­spond to a vac­cine, who do not have ac­cess to the vac­cine, who refuse to be im­mu­nised and whose im­mune re­sponse might wane over time.</p>
    <p>The ben­e­fits of this ap­proach have been demon­strated with other pathogens and other dis­eases.</p>
    <p>The Hae­mophilus in­fluen­zae Type B (Hib) con­ju­gate vac­cines were de­signed and li­censed in the early 1990s to pre­vent young chil­dren from de­vel­op­ing se­ri­ous in­fec­tions such as menin­gi­tis. Soon enough, an un­ex­pected and wel­come side ben­e­fit be­came clear: The vac­cine in­ter­rupted the bac­terium’s trans­mis­sion; af­ter its in­tro­duc­tion, oc­cur­rences of the dis­ease dropped, also in groups that had not been vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>The hu­man pa­pil­lo­mavirus</p>
    <p>(HPV) vac­cines were de­vel­oped to pre­vent cer­vi­cal can­cer and gen­i­tal warts in women. They have proved im­mensely ef­fec­tive among the women to whom they are ad­min­is­tered – and up to 50 per cent ef­fec­tive at pre­vent­ing gen­i­tal warts among un­vac­ci­nated men, ac­cord­ing to a 2017 study of health in­sur­ance records between 2005 and 2010 of some nine mil­lion peo­ple in Ger­many.</p>
    <p>To un­der­stand why this is the case, re­mem­ber what it takes for you to be­come ill from a pathogen, be it a virus or a bac­terium.</p>
    <p>First, you are ex­posed to it. Then it in­fects you. While you are in­fected, you may in­fect oth­ers. In some cases, the in­fec­tion de­vel­ops into a dis­ease. In other cases, it doesn’t: Though in­fected, you re­main asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>One way that vac­cines can in­ter­rupt a pathogen’s trans­mis­sion cy­cle is by pre­vent­ing the pathogen from caus­ing an in­fec­tion in the first place. This is how many com­mon vac­cines – against measles, mumps, rubella and chick­en­pox – op­er­ate.</p>
    <p>Other vac­cines – like the ones against meningo­coc­cal menin­gi­tis or pneu­mo­nia brought on by the pneu­mo­coc­cus bac­terium – can block the trans­mis­sion of the pathogen by in­ter­fer­ing with the in­fec­tion or by de­creas­ing ei­ther the quan­tity of pathogen that the in­fected pa­tient sheds or the du­ra­tion of the shed­ding pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Some re­cip­i­ents of the pneu­mo­coc­cal pneu­mo­nia vac­cine sim­ply don’t get in­fected with the bac­terium; oth­ers do get in­fected and carry the bac­terium in their nose, but in smaller amounts and for shorter pe­ri­ods of time than if they had not been vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>Much still needs to be learnt about pre­cisely how such mech­a­nisms work – what part do an­ti­bod­ies play? T cells? – but the up­shot from these ex­am­ples is this: Vac­cines can block the trans­mis­sion of viruses or bac­te­ria, and they can do so in sev­eral ways.</p>
    <p>Given the com­mu­nity-wide ben­e­fits of ac­com­plish­ing that, es­pe­cially in a pan­demic, cur­rent vac­cine devel­op­ment ef­forts should pri­ori­tise find­ing vac­cines that limit the trans­mis­sion of Sars-CoV-2.</p>
    <p>The United States Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) has stated that pre­vent­ing a Sars-CoV-2 in­fec­tion is in it­self a suf­fi­cient end point for the phase three tri­als of vac­cine can­di­dates – that it is an ac­cept­able al­ter­na­tive goal to pre­vent­ing the devel­op­ment of Covid-19. The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion has said that “shed­ding/trans­mis­sion” is as well.</p>
    <p>These guide­lines are an im­por­tant sig­nal, es­pe­cially con­sid­er­ing that the FDA has never ap­proved a vac­cine based on its ef­fects on in­fec­tion alone; in­stead, the agency has fo­cused ex­clu­sively on the vac­cine’s ef­fec­tive­ness at dis­ease preven­tion.</p>
    <p>And yet, vac­cine de­vel­op­ers do not seem to be heed­ing this new call.</p>
    <p>Based on our review of the phase three tests listed at Clin­i­calTri­als.gov, a data­base of tri­als con­ducted around the world, the pri­mary goal in each of these stud­ies is to re­duce the oc­cur­rence of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Four of the six Covid-19 vac­cine tri­als for which in­for­ma­tion is avail­able say they will also eval­u­ate the in­ci­dence of Sars-CoV-2 in­fec­tions among sub­jects – but only as an an­cil­lary out­come.</p>
    <p>This ap­proach is short-sighted: One can­not as­sume that a vac­cine that pre­vents the devel­op­ment of Covid-19 in a pa­tient will nec­es­sar­ily also limit the risk that the pa­tient will trans­mit Sars-CoV-2 to other peo­ple.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, a study of young Aus­tralian teenagers pub­lished in the New Eng­land Jour­nal of Medicine early this year found that the vac­cine used to pre­vent the dis­eases caused by the B strain of meningo­coc­cus in chil­dren and teenagers “had no dis­cernible ef­fect” on the pres­ence of the rel­e­vant bac­terium in the throats of vac­ci­nated sub­jects dis­play­ing no symp­toms.</p>
    <p>The in­ac­ti­vated po­lio vac­cine preva­lent in many de­vel­oped coun­tries today, known as IPV, is highly ef­fec­tive at pro­tect­ing in­di­vid­u­als against po­lio. But it is far less ef­fec­tive at re­duc­ing vi­ral shed­ding, at least in fe­cal ex­cre­tions, than the oral vac­cine, known as OPV, used more widely in other parts of the world.</p>
    <p>In the late 1990s, the US, like other wealthy coun­tries, re­placed with an acel­lu­lar vac­cine the killed-whole-cell per­tus­sis vac­cine it had pre­vi­ously used against whoop­ing cough. A resur­gence of whoop­ing cough al­ready was un­der way, but it ac­cel­er­ated then: Al­though the new vac­cine was bet­ter than the pre­vi­ous one at pro­tect­ing the in­oc­u­lated from the dis­ease, it was less good at block­ing trans­mis­sion of the bac­terium that causes the cough.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, a vac­cine that, let’s say, of­fers older adults only mod­est pro­tec­tion against de­vel­op­ing a dis­ease might nonethe­less be very ef­fec­tive, when ad­min­is­tered to healthy adults or chil­dren, at curb­ing a pathogen’s trans­mis­sion in a pop­u­la­tion over­all.</p>
    <p>This is the case with the pneu­mo­coc­cal con­ju­gate vac­cine. A 2015 study pub­lished in The New Eng­land Jour­nal of Medicine found that the vac­cine re­duced the oc­cur­rence of pneu­mo­nia in in­oc­u­lated adults age 65 or older by only about 45 per cent. Yet, ac­cord­ing to a study last year by re­searchers at the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion and Stan­ford Univer­sity, the im­mu­ni­sa­tion of in­fants and tod­dlers re­duced nine-fold the in­ci­dence of pneu­mo­coc­cal dis­ease in the el­derly.</p>
    <p>With some vac­cines, for some dis­eases, the indi­rect ben­e­fits of vac­ci­na­tion can be greater than the di­rect ef­fects.</p>
    <p>Based on these prece­dents, it could be a grave mis­take for vac­cine de­vel­op­ers now to hew only, or too closely, to the sin­gle-minded goal of pre­vent­ing Covid-19, the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Do­ing so could mean priv­i­leg­ing vac­cines that don’t block the trans­mis­sion of Sars-CoV-2 at all, or aban­don­ing vac­cines that block trans­mis­sion well enough but that, by pre­vail­ing stan­dards, are deemed to not fore­stall enough the devel­op­ment of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>That, in turn, would es­sen­tially mean that the only way to ever get rid of Sars-CoV-2 would be near-univer­sal im­mu­ni­sa­tion – a her­culean task.</p>
    <p>Fo­cus­ing on how to block the coronaviru­s’ trans­mis­sion is a much more ef­fi­cient ap­proach.</p>
    <p>This is why ran­domised con­trolled tri­als of the vac­cines cur­rently un­der con­sid­er­a­tion should in­clude reg­u­lar mon­i­tor­ing for the pres­ence of Sars-CoV-2 in study sub­jects. The goal should be to eval­u­ate whether the sub­jects ac­quire the in­fec­tion at all, and for how long, as well as how abun­dantly they shed and spread the virus, when and how.</p>
    <p>Study­ing these issues could also help cast a light on the role of so-called su­per-spread­ing events in this pan­demic.</p>
    <p>More and more re­search sug­gests that a very small num­ber of in­stances – gath­er­ings at restau­rants or bars, choir re­hearsal, fu­ner­als, church ser­vices – might ac­count for a vast ma­jor­ity of the cases of in­fec­tion over­all.</p>
    <p>But the dis­cus­sion about those in­stances has tended to fo­cus on their set­tings and cir­cum­stances, such as the pres­ence of crowds in con­fined spaces for ex­tended pe­ri­ods of time.</p>
    <p>Yet, the question of whether some in­fected in­di­vid­u­als, per­haps es­pe­cially at cer­tain stages of in­fec­tion, are par­tic­u­larly in­fec­tious – whether they them­selves are su­per-spread­ers – also needs to be stud­ied head-on: When does con­ta­gious­ness peak in whom and why? And can vac­cines mod­ify any of that?</p>
    <p>The best vac­cines don’t just pro­tect the in­oc­u­lated from get­ting sick from a dis­ease. They also pro­tect every­one else from even con­tract­ing the pathogen that causes that dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Pre­vent­ing the very trans­mis­sion of Sars-CoV-2, no less than stop­ping it from turn­ing into Covid-19, should be a main pri­or­ity of cur­rent ef­forts to develop the vac­cines to end this pan­demic.</p>
