    <p>NEW YORK • Two ac­claimed de­but nov­els and a story col­lec­tion whose au­thor died last month are among the 10 fic­tion con­tenders for this year’s Na­tional Book Award.</p>
    <p>The de­but nov­els, which the Na­tional Book Foun­da­tion an­nounced along with the rest of its fic­tion longlist last Fri­day, are A Burn­ing by Megha Ma­jum­dar and Shug­gie Bain by Dou­glas Stu­art, who had a par­tic­u­larly big week – his book was also on the Booker Prize’s short­list, an­nounced last Tues­day.</p>
    <p>If I Had Two Wings, by Ran­dall Ke­nan, who died at 57 in Au­gust, is one of two short-story col­lec­tions on the longlist, along with The Se­cret Lives Of Church Ladies by Deesha Philyaw. Ru­maan Alam’s third novel, Leave The World Be­hind, also made the list, as did Brit Ben­nett’s The Van­ish­ing Half.</p>
    <p>Is­abel Wilk­er­son (Caste) and Jill Le­pore (If Then) are two fa­mil­iar names on the l onglist for non­fic­tion.</p>
    <p>Clau­dio Saunt’s Un­wor­thy Repub­lic, about the dis­pos­ses­sion of Na­tive Amer­i­cans; Frank B. Wilder­son III’s Afropes­simism; and Karla Cornejo Villav­i­cen­cio’s The Un­doc­u­mented Amer­i­cans were among the non-fic­tion ti­tles that also made the list.</p>
    <p>All 10 of the writ­ers longlisted for po­etry are first-time nom­i­nees, and two of them are de­but au­thors: Tom­mye Blount, whose Fan­ta­sia For The Man In Blue breaks up its ti­tle poem about po­lice vi­o­lence against Black peo­ple into a quar­tet threaded through­out the book; and An­thony Cody, whose Border­land Apocrypha uses el­e­ments of doc­u­men­tary to write about ex­pe­ri­ences at the United States-Mex­ico bor­der.</p>
    <p>Peru­mal Mu­ru­gan’s The Story Of A Goat is one of the nom­i­nees in the trans­lated lit­er­a­ture cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>The novel, trans­lated from Tamil by N. Kalyan Ra­man, is Mu­ru­gan’s first since he re­nounced writ­ing in 2015 af­ter be­ing pil­lo­ried by rightwing Hindu groups.</p>
    <p>Not among the con­tenders is the Dutch nov­el­ist Marieke Lu­cas Ri­jn­eveld’s The Dis­com­fort Of Evening, trans­lated by Michele Hutchi­son and named the win­ner of this year’s In­ter­na­tional Booker Prize last month.</p>
    <p>The con­tenders for young peo­ple’s lit­er­a­ture in­clude Candice Iloh’s Ev­ery Body Look­ing, Traci Chee’s We Are Not Free and When Stars Are Scat­tered by Omar Mo­hamed and Vic­to­ria Jamieson.</p>
    <p>The short­lists of fi­nal­ists in each cat­e­gory are sched­uled to be an­nounced on Oct 6.</p>
    <p>The win­ners, nor­mally an­nounced at an event in New York City, will be un­veiled this unusual year ina vir­tual cer­e­mony on Nov 18.</p>
