    <p>In­done­sian Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo is ex­pected to an­nounce as early as this week a much-an­tic­i­pated Cabi­net reshuf­fle to re­place un­der­per­form­ing min­is­ters, in­clud­ing two min­is­ters re­cently ar­rested for cor­rup­tion, and maybe Health Min­is­ter Ter­awan Agus Pu­tranto.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic has for months urged Mr Joko to sack the health min­is­ter – fa­mously known for ask­ing peo­ple to pray to ward off the coro­n­avirus – for in­com­pe­tence.</p>
    <p>“It could be as soon as next week,” said one of two peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the is­sue, who spoke on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The other source said the in­au­gu­ra­tion of new min­is­ters is ex­pected to be held on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry would be led by a per­son with a non-med­i­cal doc­tor back­ground and strong man­age­rial skills, the sec­ond source said. “He would have one vice-health min­is­ter who has a med­i­cal doc­tor back­ground.”</p>
    <p>So­cial Af­fairs Min­is­ter Ju­liari P. Batubara was detained by the Cor­rup­tion Erad­i­ca­tion Com­mis­sion on Dec 6, as part of the anti-graft agency’s probe into a bribery case in­volv­ing a pri­vate com­pany that has won con­tracts from his min­istry to sup­ply aid pack­ages to those af­fected by the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>On Nov 25, Mar­itime Af­fairs and Fish­eries Min­is­ter Edhy Prabowo was ar­rested for al­leged graft re­lated to his min­istry’s de­ci­sion to lift a ban on lob­ster lar­vae ex­ports.</p>
    <p>Mr Joko, pop­u­larly known as Jokowi at home, was re-elected last year and is serv­ing his sec­ond and fi­nal five-year term in of­fice.</p>
    <p>He reshuf­fled his Cabi­net sev­eral times dur­ing his first term, from 2014 to last year.</p>
    <p>More than 15 of the 34 Cabi­net min­is­ters ap­pointed by Mr Joko at the be­gin­ning of his cur­rent term are from var­i­ous po­lit­i­cal par­ties in a coali­tion sup­port­ing him.</p>
    <p>The rest of the Cabi­net is made up of tech­nocrats, as well as en­trepreneur­s and busi­ness­men.</p>
    <p>News of the reshuf­fle emerged as early as June, when the Pres­i­dent be­rated his min­is­ters over the “lack of a sense of cri­sis” in deal­ing with the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He said the min­is­ters were work­ing in a busi­ness-as-usual mode in tack­ling the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Mr Joko said he was very dis­ap­pointed with the slow dis­burse­ment of ur­gently needed funds, such as aid for the poor, stim­u­lus for busi­nesses to pre-empt lay­offs, money to buy med­i­cal equip­ment and spe­cial al­lowances for med­i­cal doc­tors and nurses.</p>
    <p>He was es­pe­cially an­gered by a re­port, which said the Health Min­istry had spent only 1.5 per cent of the 75 tril­lion ru­piah (S$7.06 bil­lion) al­lo­cated to it as emer­gency funds.</p>
    <p>The to­tal amount of funds set aside to mit­i­gate the im­pact of Covid-19 is 700 tril­lion ru­piah.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ters re­sponded by speed­ing up the dis­burse­ments and step­ping up ef­forts to con­tain the virus.</p>
    <p>But in Septem­ber, Mr Joko ap­pointed his clos­est aide, Mr Luhut Pand­jai­tan, the Co­or­di­nat­ing Mar­itime Af­fairs and In­vest­ment Min­is­ter, to help speed up the ef­forts, es­pe­cially in the hard­est-hit prov­inces.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia has the high­est num­ber of in­fec­tions and deaths in South-east Asia. As at yes­ter­day, the coun­try has hit a to­tal 664,930 in­fec­tions and 19,880 deaths.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia is cur­rently gear­ing up to roll out its vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Orig­i­nally planned to start as soon as l ast month, the pro­gramme is now slated for early next year, af­ter de­lays caused by a poorly or­gan­ised clin­i­cal trial of China’s Si­no­vac Biotech vac­cine can­di­date that has been jointly con­ducted since Au­gust by state-run drug­maker Bio Farma and the Univer­sity of Pad­jad­jaran in West Java.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics have blamed Dr Ter­awan and oth­ers for weak su­per­vi­sion of this on­go­ing clin­i­cal trial.</p>
    <p>The low num­ber of vol­un­teers par­tic­i­pat­ing in a phase three clin­i­cal trial and the lack of vol­un­teers, who rep­re­sent the risk groups such as med­i­cal work­ers, have made it dif­fi­cult to come up with an in­terim anal­y­sis, a pre­req­ui­site be­fore the in­de­pen­dent food and drug agency BPOM can re­view the vac­cine for ap­proval for emer­gency use.</p>
    <p>The phase three clin­i­cal trial is the fi­nal stage that a vac­cine can­di­date must clear be­fore it is given the go-ahead for use.</p>
    <p>The Univer­sity of Pad­jad­jaran’s clin­i­cal trial in­volves only about 1,600 vol­un­teers and the por­tion rep­re­sent­ing the risk group is very low, which means there is a lower chance that the re­quired num­ber of vol­un­teers would be ex­posed to in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>To test the ef­fi­cacy of the vac­cine can­di­date un­der the univer­sity’s clin­i­cal trial, a min­i­mum of 25 of the 1,600 vol­un­teers must have con­tracted the virus to then be mon­i­tored.</p>
    <p>Brazil, with a pop­u­la­tion of 210 mil­lion, smaller than In­done­sia’s 270 mil­lion, had re­cruited 10,000 vol­un­teers in its Si­no­vac vac­cine can­di­date clin­i­cal trial and has thus been able to make bet­ter progress.</p>
