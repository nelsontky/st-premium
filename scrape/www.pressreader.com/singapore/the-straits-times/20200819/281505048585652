    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Former first lady Michelle Obama launched a scathing at­tack on Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump on the first night of the Demo­cratic Na­tional Con­ven­tion, call­ing him the “wrong pres­i­dent” for the coun­try and urg­ing Amer­i­cans to elect Mr Joe Bi­den in Novem­ber to end the chaos cre­ated by Mr Trump’s pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>While ac­knowl­edg­ing she did not care much for pol­i­tics, Mrs Obama said on Mon­day that Mr Bi­den’s steady and em­pa­thetic ap­proach to prob­lems was the an­swer and urged vot­ers to stand in line or do what­ever it takes to en­sure they can beat Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Mrs Obama, whose hus­band Barack Obama was pres­i­dent when Mr Bi­den was vice-pres­i­dent from 2009 to 2017, capped a long pa­rade of speak­ers, in­clud­ing some of Mr Trump’s fel­low Repub­li­cans, who made the case for Mr Bi­den at the start of his four-day nom­i­nat­ing con­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>“When­ever we look to this White House for some lead­er­ship or con­so­la­tion or any sem­blance of steadi­ness, what we get in­stead is chaos, di­vi­sion, and a to­tal and ut­ter lack of em­pa­thy,” Mrs Obama said, adding that Mr Trump was “in over his head” as pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>“So if you take one thing from my words tonight, it is this: If you think things can­not pos­si­bly get worse, trust me, they can; and they will if we don’t make a change in this elec­tion. If we have any hope of ending this chaos, we have got to vote for Joe Bi­den like our lives de­pend on it,” she said.</p>
    <p>Former pres­i­den­tial hope­ful Bernie San­ders and prom­i­nent Repub­li­can J ohn Ka­sich said Mr Bi­den’s steady ap­proach to prob­lems was needed to con­front the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, eco­nomic woes and ra­cial in­jus­tice.</p>
    <p>Mr San­ders, a US se­na­tor who was Mr Bi­den’s top pri­mary ri­val, said: “Joe Bi­den will end the hate and di­vi­sion Trump has cre­ated. He will stop the de­mon­i­sa­tion of im­mi­grants, the cod­dling of white na­tion­al­ists, the racist dog whistling, the re­li­gious big­otry and the ugly at­tacks on women.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump re­sponded yes­ter­day morn­ing, bash­ing Mr Obama’s two terms in of­fice in a se­ries of tweets with un­founded al­le­ga­tions of “cor­rup­tion”, “trea­son” and “spy­ing” on his cam­paign.</p>
    <p>“Some­body please explain to @MichelleOb­ama that Don­ald J. Trump would not be here, in the beautiful White House, if it weren’t for the job done by your hus­band, Barack Obama,” Mr Trump wrote.</p>
    <p>“Bi­den was merely an af­ter­thought, a good rea­son for that very late & un­en­thu­si­as­tic en­dorse­ment.”</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic forced Mr Bi­den’s Democrats to over­haul the con­ven­tion, largely elim­i­nat­ing the in-per­son gath­er­ing planned for Mil­wau­kee, Wis­con­sin, and turn­ing it into two-hour, prime-time pack­ages of vir­tual speeches and events from around the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The con­ven­tion featured dis­cus­sions with vot­ers who de­scribed their strug­gles con­fronting the virus cri­sis and cop­ing with the slump­ing econ­omy and health­care.</p>
    <p>Ms Kristin Urquiza, who lost her fa­ther to Covid-19, blamed Mr Trump’s mis­man­age­ment of the pan­demic for his death.</p>
    <p>“My dad was a healthy 65-yearold. His only pre-ex­ist­ing con­di­tion was trust­ing Don­ald Trump, and for that, he paid with his life,” she said. “When I cast my vote for Joe Bi­den, I will do it for my dad.”</p>
    <p>The con­ven­tion opened amid widespread wor­ries about the safety of vot­ing in Novem­ber be­cause of the pan­demic. Democrats have pushed mail-in bal­lots as a safe al­ter­na­tive, but fear it could be hin­dered by cost cuts at the Postal Ser­vice that, un­der Post­mas­ter Gen­eral Louis DeJoy, a top Trump donor, have led to de­lays in mail ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Se­na­tor Amy Klobuchar, who ran un­suc­cess­fully against Mr Bi­den in the 2020 pri­mary, said: “The Pres­i­dent may hate the Post Of­fice, but he’s still go­ing to have to send them a change of ad­dress card come Jan­uary.”</p>
    <p>The in­clu­sion of Repub­li­can speak­ers an­gered some Democrats who voiced con­cern that it would take time away from pro­gres­sive speak­ers like US Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Alexan­dria Oca­sio-Cortez.</p>
    <p>But Mr Cedric Rich­mond, a Louisiana con­gress­man and Mr Bi­den’s cam­paign co-chair­man, pushed back against that idea, telling reporters ear­lier in the day: “Re­mem­ber tonight’s theme is ‘We the Peo­ple,’ not ‘We the Democrats.’”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, 77, led Mr Trump, 74, in na­tional opin­ion polls head­ing into the back-to-back con­ven­tion weeks for the two po­lit­i­cal par­ties.</p>
