    <p>Front-line work­ers who have been toil­ing day in and day out since the coro­n­avirus out­break be­gan here in Jan­uary were hon­oured by a grate­ful na­tion yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The tributes for those tack­ling the pan­demic ranged far and wide dur­ing the Na­tional Day cel­e­bra­tions and even reached for the sky when the Red Lions parachuted and landed grace­fully on fields near Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral and Sengkang Gen­eral hospi­tals.</p>
    <p>The 12 parachutis­ts – six at each lo­ca­tion – were met with l oud cheers and clap­ping while shut­ter­bugs snapped away fu­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>The Red Lions later saluted health­care work­ers at the two hospi­tals.</p>
    <p>Ms Siti Aisyah Sam­sudin, 31, spe­cial­ist out­pa­tient clin­ics ser­vice team leader at Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hospi­tal, said watch­ing the Red Lions in the heart­land was a “whole new, ex­cit­ing ex­pe­ri­ence”.</p>
    <p>“I feel in­cred­i­bly grate­ful that Sin­ga­pore­ans ap­pre­ci­ate the ef­forts of those of us in health­care. It has been chal­leng­ing yet ful­fill­ing,” she added. “Let’s con­tinue to stay safe and care for one another in th­ese try­ing times.”</p>
    <p>That was not the only trib­ute from the wide blue yon­der: Six F-15 fighter jets also looped past eight hospi­tals in a spec­tac­u­lar dis­play.</p>
    <p>A col­umn of mil­i­tary ve­hi­cles and as­sets also made its way into the heart­land, rolling past key lo­ca­tions like Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral, Sengkang Gen­eral and Khoo Teck Puat Gen­eral hospi­tals and the com­mu­nity care fa­cil­ity at Sin­ga­pore Expo.</p>
    <p>Dr An­nitha An­nathu­rai, 46, head of the emer­gency medicine depart­ment at Sengkang Gen­eral Hospi­tal, said the dis­play was hum­bling, adding: “We are just do­ing what we have been trained for and this spe­cial recog­ni­tion will mo­ti­vate us fur­ther to con­tinue to pro­vide the best care, al­ways.</p>
    <p>“This trib­ute gives us the strength to per­sist and con­tinue on.”</p>
    <p>The evening show at The Star Vista also show­cased sto­ries of Sin­ga­pore­ans step­ping up dur­ing the out­break, and cul­mi­nated in a Light Up Mo­ment, when peo­ple across the is­land lifted up their phones for a na­tion­wide dis­play of ap­pre­ci­a­tion for those who have been mak­ing a dif­fer­ence amid the pan­demic.</p>
