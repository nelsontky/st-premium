    <p>Q If the au­thor­i­ties have com­pleted test­ing of all work­ers in dor­mi­to­ries, why are we still get­ting re­ports of work­ers be­ing in­fected?</p>
    <p>A The Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) said on Tues­day that the test­ing of all mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries has been com­pleted. How­ever, new in­fec­tions among work­ers may be de­tected from two sources.</p>
    <p>First, there were about 22,800 work­ers as of Wed­nes­day who were still in iso­la­tion in cen­tralised gov­ern­ment quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties and in 17 stand­alone blocks in six pur­pose-built dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>As the iso­la­tion pe­ri­ods for these work­ers come to an end, they will be tested, which may re­veal new in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) has said that be­cause of these tests, it ex­pects the daily case counts to re­main high be­fore ta­per­ing off as more work­ers com­plete their iso­la­tion and test neg­a­tive for the virus.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, work­ers who pre­vi­ously tested neg­a­tive for the coro­n­avirus and are stay­ing in cleared dor­mi­to­ries are sus­cep­ti­ble to catch­ing the virus, just like any­one else. New cases may arise among these work­ers.</p>
    <p>Q MOH an­nounced on Wed­nes­day night that 800 for­eign work­ers had been quar­an­tined after a new case was dis­cov­ered among them in a cleared dor­mi­tory. How can just one case lead to 800 work­ers be­ing quar­an­tined?</p>
    <p>A MOM said that if its mon­i­tor­ing picks up po­ten­tial in­fec­tions among the mi­grant work­ers, the in­ter-agency task force will quickly iso­late and quar­an­tine all at-risk work­ers within the block that housed the in­fected worker as a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure.</p>
    <p>It added that “ag­gres­sive test­ing” would then be con­ducted to iden­tify any fur­ther spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>How­ever, work­ers who have re­cov­ered from the virus for 90 days and less will not be iso­lated as cur­rent med­i­cal ev­i­dence sug­gests that they con­tinue to have im­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Should they de­velop fresh res­pi­ra­tory symp­toms, those who have re­cov­ered from Covid-19 more than 90 days ago from their orig­i­nal ill­ness will be as­sessed as to whether they will re­quire re­peat test­ing and iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing New Zealand’s three-day lock­down in Auck­land from Wed­nes­day after four new coro­n­avirus cases were con­firmed, Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said quar­an­tin­ing 800 work­ers after one in­fec­tion was dis­cov­ered among them was not an over­re­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>He said: “Quar­an­tin­ing pos­si­bly ex­posed work­ers un­til we un­der­stand the sit­u­a­tion bet­ter is a very pru­dent strat­egy. Other mea­sures that are be­ing used to complement the quar­an­tine are also just as im­por­tant, like con­tact trac­ing or per­form­ing batch test­ing.”</p>
    <p>If such mea­sures com­ple­mented the quar­an­tine, Prof Teo said it is pos­si­ble that a num­ber of these 800 for­eign work­ers may not need to serve a full 14-day quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Q If for­eign work­ers are in my home to do ren­o­va­tions, is it safe?</p>
    <p>A The short an­swer is yes. Mul­ti­ple re­quire­ments have to be met be­fore for­eign work­ers can leave their dor­mi­to­ries for work.</p>
    <p>So, if they have been ap­proved to restart work, their dorms have to be cleared of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Var­i­ous safe liv­ing mea­sures to min­imise min­gling among groups at dif­fer­ent work­sites and work­ers stay­ing in dif­fer­ent dor­mi­tory blocks have been put in place. These mea­sures min­imise the po­ten­tial spread of the virus among res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>And of course, these work­ers must have ei­ther re­cov­ered or tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 be­fore they can restart work.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, work­ers have to down­load three smart­phone apps, in­clud­ing the lat­est ver­sion of con­tract trac­ing app TraceTo­gether.</p>
    <p>Work­ers also have to re­port their tem­per­a­ture and if they have any acute res­pi­ra­tory ill­ness symp­toms through FWMOMCare twice daily. They will re­ceive med­i­cal at­ten­tion and will not be al­lowed to re­port for work if they are un­well.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, work­ers in high­er­risk set­tings are tested reg­u­larly ev­ery 14 days. These in­clude work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries and work­ers who work on-site in the con­struc­tion, marine and process sec­tors.</p>
