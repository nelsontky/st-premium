    <p>KOTA BELUD • Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin said yes­ter­day that his six-month-old gov­ern­ment “should quickly” hold a gen­eral elec­tion if his al­lies win the Sept 26 Sabah state polls.</p>
    <p>This is the first time that he has openly voiced the pos­si­bil­ity of snap na­tional polls amid reg­u­lar ac­cu­sa­tions by the op­po­si­tion that the Perikatan Na­sional (PN) coali­tion that he leads is a “back­door gov­ern­ment”.</p>
    <p>Umno, a part­ner but not a mem­ber of PN, has been push­ing for an early gen­eral elec­tion as well, as it be­lieves it could re­turn to power and choose its own prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>“At the na­tional level, we haven’t de­cided when the gen­eral elec­tion should be called,” Tan Sri Muhyid­din was quoted as say­ing by Ber­nama news agency, while cam­paign­ing in Kota Belud, Sabah.</p>
    <p>“But if we win the state elec­tion in Sabah... we should quickly hold the gen­eral elec­tion.”</p>
    <p>He added: “What’s im­por­tant in the Sabah polls is the sig­nal that we can get on whether or not they are sup­port­ing Perikatan Na­sional or want­ing me to con­tinue be­ing the prime min­is­ter, be­cause we want Malaysia to move for­ward and suc­ceed. One of the ways to suc­ceed is to stick with me.”</p>
    <p>The next gen­eral elec­tion is not due un­til 2023, but there have been per­sis­tent whis­pers that Mr Muhyid­din would call for snap polls in the next few months.</p>
    <p>Sabah was con­trolled by a fed­eral op­po­si­tion al­liance led by Parti Warisan Sabah (Warisan) af­ter the 2018 gen­eral elec­tion, but it crum­bled at end-July af­ter a group of</p>
    <p>The next gen­eral elec­tion is not due un­til 2023, but there have been per­sis­tent whis­pers that Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin would call for snap polls in the next few months.</p>
    <p>state as­sem­bly­men de­fected, which led to fresh elec­tions be­ing called.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din’s PN, with its al­lies Barisan Na­sional and Parti Ber­satu Sabah, hopes to re­place Warisan as the state gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>A win would, at the same time, ce­ment the find­ings of a re­cent sur­vey that the Pre­mier is pop­u­lar among vot­ers.</p>
    <p>A sur­vey by in­de­pen­dent poll­ster Merdeka Cen­tre re­leased early this month found that Mr Muhyid­din’s ap­proval rat­ing among Malaysians was at 69 per cent. The PN coali­tion and its part­ners scored well be­low 50 per cent, mak­ing the Pre­mier an as­set among vot­ers.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey found that 51 per cent of those polled be­lieve Malaysia is headed in the right di­rec­tion, dou­ble the 25 per cent who felt the same way dur­ing ri­val Pakatan Hara­pan’s (PH) fi­nal months in power.</p>
    <p>Warisan is aligned to the PH coali­tion that ruled Malaysia be­fore it was re­placed by PN six months ago.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din said Saba­hans should vote for PN-al­lied par­ties as the fed­eral gov­ern­ment would be able to bring devel­op­ment to Sabah, the sec­ond-big­gest among Malaysia’s 13 states and one of its poor­est.</p>
    <p>“If there is a chance to form a new state gov­ern­ment, do not opt for Warisan be­cause Pakatan Hara­pan has ceased to ex­ist and no longer rules the coun­try,” Mr Muhyid­din said, as quoted by Ber­nama.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think the Sabah peo­ple would still want to choose the op­po­si­tion dur­ing this very crit­i­cal sit­u­a­tion, es­pe­cially when eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties are de­clin­ing due to Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>De facto Law Min­is­ter Takiyud­din Has­san told Par­lia­ment l ast month that it could cost RM1.2 bil­lion (S$396.2 mil­lion) to hold a gen­eral elec­tion in Malaysia amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
