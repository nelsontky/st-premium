    <p>Twelve reli­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions span­ning mosques, Hindu tem­ples, churches, Bud­dhist tem­ples and gur­d­waras will be al­lowed to hold gath­er­ings of up to 100 peo­ple from Fri­day, as the Gov­ern­ment eased some Covid-19 rules yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This will ap­ply only to con­gre­ga­tional and wor­ship ser­vices, and is dou­ble the num­ber of peo­ple th­ese or­gan­i­sa­tions are cur­rently al­lowed to host at any one time.</p>
    <p>The new move will re­sult in new safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, such as the use of two sep­a­rate zones of up to 50 peo­ple each, at some of th­ese places where seated or more struc­tured ser­vices are held, said the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth (MCCY).</p>
    <p>Zones will have to be sep­a­rated by a phys­i­cal par­ti­tion or bar­rier, and must have sep­a­rate en­trances and ex­its, or stag­gered en­try and exit tim­ings.</p>
    <p>The 12 sites were iden­ti­fied by the min­istry as part of a pi­lot test in con­sul­ta­tion with reli­gious lead­ers.</p>
    <p>They are: Masjid Assyafaah, Masjid Mu­jahidin, Masjid Al-Istigh­far and Masjid Al-Iman for Fri­day prayers; Sri Mari­amman Tem­ple on Fri­days only and Sri Srini­vasa Peru­mal Tem­ple on Satur­days only; St An­drew’s Cathe­dral, Jurong Chris­tian Church, Amaz­ing Grace Pres­by­te­rian Church, Sengkang Methodist Church, Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery and Cen­tral Sikh Tem­ple on Satur­days and Sun­days only.</p>
    <p>MCCY said the se­lected sites have proven to be able to safely con­duct ser­vices for up to 50 peo­ple un­der phase two guide­lines im­ple­mented on June 26. The guide­lines in­clude con­gre­gants wear­ing a face mask at all times, and not al­low­ing singing and live per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>Be­fore that, reli­gious ac­tiv­i­ties largely took place vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>MCCY said phase two guide­lines will re­main in place at th­ese 12 se­lected places of wor­ship, and how well they en­sure a safe en­vi­ron­ment for wor­ship­pers will de­ter­mine whether the ini­tia­tive is ex­panded to other reli­gious sites.</p>
    <p>The Is­lamic Reli­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore (Muis) said the trial is a test of the readi­ness of mosques and con­gre­gants to per­form Fri­day prayers in large num­bers.</p>
    <p>The four mosques in MCCY’s pi­lot will each im­ple­ment the min­istry’s dual zones for con­gre­gants, which will open up 600 more places for the three prayer ses­sions on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>As Fri­day prayers were al­lowed to re­sume for small num­bers of peo­ple on June 26, the coun­cil said con­gre­gants have “adapted well to new norms and be­haved in a co­op­er­a­tive and re­spon­si­ble man­ner”.</p>
    <p>“Although there have been vis­its by asymp­to­matic in­di­vid­u­als to a few mosques, there have not been cases of in­fec­tion or clus­ters linked to mosques so far,” Muis added.</p>
    <p>Mr Terry Wong, vicar of St An­drew’s Cathe­dral, said the in­crease of 50 wor­ship­pers per ses­sion “may not make a big dif­fer­ence but is a right step in the di­rec­tion of try­ing to find a ‘new nor­mal’ ”.</p>
    <p>He said he un­der­stood the MCCY’s cau­tious ap­proach and will likely pro­vide the ad­di­tional 50 spots to con­gre­gants on a first come, first served ba­sis.</p>
    <p>“We are hop­ing that with the ef­fec­tive im­ple­men­ta­tion of safety mea­sures, all churches and reli­gious places will find the right bal­ance for the com­ing months,” he said.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery is one of 12 reli&#xAD;gious sites that will be al&#xAD;lowed to hold ser&#xAD;vices for up to 100 con&#xAD;gre&#xAD;gants.
