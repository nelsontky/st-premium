    <p>A slew of coun­tries closed their bor­ders to Bri­tain yes­ter­day over fears of a highly in­fec­tious new coro­n­avirus strain, height­en­ing global panic, caus­ing travel chaos and rais­ing the prospect of food short­ages in Bri­tain days be­fore the Brexit cliff edge. Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s spokesman said yes­ter­day that Bri­tain is work­ing closely with other coun­tries to min­imise trans­port dis­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tain is work­ing closely with oth­ers to min­imise trans­port dis­rup­tion, Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s spokesman said yes­ter­day af­ter a slew of ter­ri­to­ries banned trav­ellers and freight from Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>The var­i­ous coun­tries and ter­ri­to­ries closed their bor­ders to Bri­tain over fears of a highly in­fec­tious new coro­n­avirus strain, height­en­ing global panic, caus­ing travel chaos and rais­ing the prospect of UK food short­ages days be­fore the Brexit cliff edge.</p>
    <p>“We are work­ing closely with our in­ter­na­tional part­ners and are work­ing ur­gently to min­imise the dis­rup­tion,” the spokesman told re­porters.</p>
    <p>Asked whether the gov­ern­ment be­lieved a French travel ban was partly mo­ti­vated by Brexit, the spokesman said: “As has been the case through­out the pan­demic, there have been dif­fer­ent travel re­stric­tions im­posed around the world.”</p>
    <p>Sev­eral coun­tries and ter­ri­to­ries – in­clud­ing In­dia, Poland, Spain, Switzer­land, Rus­sia, Jor­dan, France, Ger­many, Italy, the Nether­lands, Aus­tria, Ire­land, Is­rael, Canada and Hong Kong – have sus­pended travel from Bri­tain af­ter Mr John­son warned that a mu­tated virus vari­ant, up to 70 per cent more trans­mis­si­ble, had been iden­ti­fied in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>How­ever, sci­en­tists said the strain may al­ready be cir­cu­lat­ing in coun­tries with less ad­vanced de­tec­tion meth­ods than the United King­dom.</p>
    <p>Saudi Ara­bia, Kuwait and Oman closed their bor­ders com­pletely.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia said two peo­ple who trav­elled from the UK to New South Wales state were found to be car­ry­ing the mu­tated virus.</p>
    <p>New York Gover­nor An­drew Cuomo urged the US gov­ern­ment to take steps to pre­vent the new strain from en­ter­ing the coun­try, which has been the worst hit by Covid-19 with al­most 318,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>“It is high time the fed­eral gov­ern­ment takes swift ac­tion be­cause to­day that vari­ant is getting on a plane and land­ing in JFK, and all it takes is one per­son,” he said.</p>
    <p>US As­sis­tant Health Sec­re­tary Brett Giroir said noth­ing had yet been de­cided on any travel ban. “I think every­thing is pos­si­ble. We just need to put every­thing on the ta­ble, have an open sci­en­tific dis­cus­sion and make the best rec­om­men­da­tion,” he told CNN. He said the White House coro­n­avirus task force would meet later yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son was also to chair an emer­gency re­sponse meet­ing yes­ter­day to dis­cuss in­ter­na­tional travel, in par­tic­u­lar the flow of freight in and out of Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean Union of­fi­cials held a meet­ing on co­or­di­nat­ing their re­sponse.</p>
    <p>France shut its border to ar­rivals of peo­ple and trucks from Bri­tain, clos­ing off one of the most im­por­tant trade ar­ter­ies with main­land Europe.</p>
    <p>As fam­i­lies and truck driv­ers</p>
    <p>tried to nav­i­gate the travel bans to get back home in time for Christ­mas, Bri­tish su­per­mar­ket chain Sains­bury’s said short­ages would start to ap­pear within days if trans­port ties were not quickly re­stored.</p>
    <p>“If noth­ing changes, we will start to see gaps over the com­ing days on let­tuce, some salad leaves, cauliflow­ers, broc­coli and cit­rus fruit – all of which are im­ported from the con­ti­nent at this time of year,” a spokesman said.</p>
    <p>France’s FNTR na­tional road haulage fed­er­a­tion said: “No driver wants to de­liver to the UK now, so the UK is go­ing to see its freight sup­ply dry up.”</p>
    <p>The global alarm was re­flected in fi­nan­cial mar­kets. Euro­pean shares slumped, with travel and leisure stocks bear­ing the brunt of t he pain; Bri­tish Air­ways owner IAG and easyJet fell about 8 per cent.</p>
    <p>The new vari­ant and re­stric­tions in Bri­tain com­pound the chaos as the coun­try pre­pares to fi­nally part ways with the EU, pos­si­bly with­out a trade deal, when the Brexit tran­si­tion pe­riod ends at 2300 GMT on Dec 31.</p>
    <p>The new vari­ant, which sci­en­tists said was 40 per cent to 70 per cent more trans­mis­si­ble, is rapidly be­com­ing the dom­i­nant strain in parts of south­ern Eng­land, in­clud­ing Lon­don.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts stressed, though, that there was no ev­i­dence that vac­cines, in­clud­ing the one made by Pfizer and BioNTech, would not pro­tect against this vari­ant.</p>
