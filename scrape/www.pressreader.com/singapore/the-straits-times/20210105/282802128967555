    <p>Ac­tion su­per­star Jackie Chan ap­peared rather the worse for wear at a re­cent New Year’s Day event, due to the re­cur­rence of a lum­bar in­jury.</p>
    <p>Clad in a grey track­suit, the 66-year-old Hong Kong ac­tor had to lean on the shoul­ders of two peo­ple while mak­ing an en­trance at a screen­ing of an­i­mated film Wish Dragon.</p>
    <p>His sur­prise ap­pear­ance, as well as his slow and la­bo­ri­ous move­ments, shocked the au­di­ence at the event in Beijing.</p>
    <p>Even though he was not able to stand for long, he was clearly de­lighted to be there to say hello to the chil­dren present.</p>
    <p>No­to­ri­ous for not us­ing stunt dou­bles in his ac­tion flicks in his decades in show busi­ness, Chan has been in­jured far too many times to list.</p>
    <p>The dare­devil’s most se­ri­ous and life-threat­en­ing in­jury hap­pened while film­ing Ar­mour Of God (1986), when he fell straight onto his back as he leapt from a cliff onto a tree.</p>
    <p>The im­pact drove a piece of bone into his brain, caus­ing him to bleed pro­fusely from the ear.</p>
    <p>He is no stranger to sus­tain­ing in­juries on set, but for­tu­nately, his lat­est movie has been ac­ci­dent-free.</p>
    <p>He lends his voice to Wish Dragon, a Chi­nese-Amer­i­can ven­ture, and is also one of its pro­duc­ers.</p>
    <p>While he voices the dragon in the Man­darin ver­sion, Amer­i­can ac­tor John Cho voices the English ver­sion.</p>
    <p>To be re­leased on Jan 15 in China and June 4 in the United States, the movie is a retelling of the clas­sic tale of the ge­nie in the bot­tle, set in modern-day China.</p>
