    <p>There are many good el­e­ments in the pro­posed changes to MediShield Life (MediShield</p>
    <p>Life cov­er­age set to widen next year, Sept 30).</p>
    <p>Bet­ter cov­er­age, higher lim­its, and en­sur­ing con­tin­ued vi­a­bil­ity by rais­ing pre­mi­ums, in prin­ci­ple, can­not be faulted.</p>
    <p>How­ever, any change to MediShield Life al­ways has a rip­ple ef­fect on pri­vate In­te­grated Shield Plans (IPs). About 70 per cent of Sin­ga­pore­ans have IPs. So we need to re­view the full pic­ture.</p>
    <p>If there is an in­crease in MediShield Life’s cov­er­age and in­creased pre­mi­ums as a re­sult, then by corol­lary there is less that needs to be cov­ered by the IP and, hence, there should be lower IP pre­mi­ums.</p>
    <p>We cur­rently can­not see what the net over­all im­pact of MediShield Life changes will be on our pock­ets, un­til we see the con­crete im­pact of any changes to both MediShield</p>
    <p>Life and IP cov­er­age and pre­mi­ums.</p>
    <p>I rec­om­mend that the Gov­ern­ment present the full pic­ture of the pro­posed changes, both to IPs and MediShield Life, for cit­i­zen feed­back, be­fore im­ple­ment­ing any change to just MediShield Life.</p>
    <p>A much big­ger pol­icy ques­tion is about pub­lic hos­pi­tal ca­pac­ity. That pub­lic hos­pi­tals are full to ca­pac­ity tells us that most mid­dle- to lower-in­come cit­i­zens do want to use pub­lic hos­pi­tals and thereby also ben­e­fit from the lower pre­mi­ums and sub­sidised charges.</p>
    <p>How­ever, many cit­i­zens opt for IPs be­cause they don’t want to be kept wait­ing for treat­ment in pub­lic hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>If pub­lic hos­pi­tal ca­pac­ity were in­creased by 50 per cent, I think the num­ber of peo­ple sub­scrib­ing to IPs might drop to be­low half of the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>This would be a much bet­ter way to ben­e­fit the mid­dle- to lower-in­come groups in our so­ci­ety, as­sur­ing ev­ery­one of high qual­ity treat­ment with­out de­lay, at low but vi­able MediShield Life pre­mi­ums, and de­cent cov­er­age for most ill­nesses.</p>
    <p>The larger the pub­lic pool, the more economies of scale will drive pre­mi­ums down fur­ther.</p>
    <p>In­stead, we seem to be grow­ing pri­vate hos­pi­tal ca­pac­ity more quickly than pub­lic ca­pac­ity, which is a sure way to rapidly in­crease the av­er­age cost per cit­i­zen of med­i­cal care in our so­ci­ety. Rahul Ke­shav Pat­ward­han</p>
