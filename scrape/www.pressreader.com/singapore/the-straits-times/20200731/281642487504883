    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) will be tak­ing more dras­tic mea­sures to rein in costs, in­clud­ing vary­ing lev­els of pay cuts for all man­age­ment and rankand-file staff, as well as early re­tire­ment for ground staff and pi­lots.</p>
    <p>The full quan­tum of the monthly vari­able com­po­nent of salaries will be cut from to­mor­row, in ac­cor­dance with the group’s col­lec­tive agree­ments with its unions after the first-quar­ter op­er­at­ing loss for SIA and its re­gional arm SilkAir.</p>
    <p>This amounts to 10 per cent of the ba­sic salary for all staff below the rank of man­ager, said SIA chief ex­ec­u­tive Goh Choon Phong in a no­tice to staff this week.</p>
    <p>All staff who are at the man­ager level and above will also see deeper cuts to their ba­sic salary from to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Man­agers and se­nior man­agers will have their salaries cut by 12 per cent, up from 10 per cent ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Vice-pres­i­dents and di­vi­sional vice-pres­i­dents will see a 15 per cent cut, up from 12 per cent.</p>
    <p>Se­nior vice-pres­i­dents will take a 25 per cent cut, up from 20 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ex­ec­u­tive vice-pres­i­dents will see a 30 per cent re­duc­tion, up from 25 per cent.</p>
    <p>This comes as the re­cov­ery tra­jec­tory in in­ter­na­tional air travel is weaker than ini­tially ex­pected, said Mr Goh, whose salary will be slashed by 35 per cent, up from 30 per cent.</p>
    <p>“The num­ber of in­fec­tions con­tin­ues to rise glob­ally, with some re­gions bat­tling a sec­ond or third wave. Bor­ders are likely to open only very slowly in the ab­sence of a vac­cine or an ef­fec­tive treat­ment.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany will of­fer a Covid-19 spe­cial early re­tire­ment scheme for ground staff and pi­lots next week.</p>
    <p>This will be avail­able to those aged 50 and above, up to the level of di­vi­sional vice-pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>They must have at least 15 years of ser­vice with the group.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­ca­tions for early re­tire­ment will be ap­proved based on or­gan­i­sa­tional and op­er­a­tional re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>More de­tails will be re­leased by the hu­man re­sources di­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh told staff to brace them­selves for ad­di­tional mea­sures, given the slower growth tra­jec­tory and de­pressed mar­ket con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>“We will be en­gag­ing our staff unions on this and will an­nounce the mea­sures when they have been firmed up,” he added.</p>
    <p>“Our im­me­di­ate pri­or­ity is to do ev­ery­thing we can to sur­vive this cri­sis and be ready for the long trudge ahead of us.”</p>
    <p>The SIA group an­nounced a net loss of $1.12 bil­lion for the first quar­ter ended June 30, as de­mand plum­meted amid travel re­stric­tions caused by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In his memo to staff seen by The Straits Times, Mr Goh shared that in­dus­try ex­perts now fore­cast that it will take about two to four years for pas­sen­ger traf­fic num­bers to re­turn to pre-pan­demic lev­els.</p>
    <p>Amid on­go­ing bor­der con­trols and travel re­stric­tions, and with­out a do­mes­tic mar­ket to fall back on, pas­sen­ger ca­pac­ity dur­ing the April-June quar­ter is about 5 per cent of the level be­fore Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“The load fac­tor for that skele­tal net­work was at 10.2 per cent for the quar­ter, down from 83.4 per cent,” said Mr Goh.</p>
    <p>“We car­ried a to­tal of only 38,000 cus­tomers dur­ing those three months – a whop­ping 99.6 per cent drop from al­most 9.4 mil­lion a year be­fore.”</p>
    <p>Mr Goh added that the group needs to be pre­pared for “a long and hard Covid-19-in­duced win­ter”.</p>
    <p>SIA shares fell to their low­est in over 21 years yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It tum­bled by as much as 5.1 per cent to $3.35, the low­est in­tra-day price since Septem­ber 1998, be­fore clos­ing 3.12 per cent lower at $3.42.</p>
