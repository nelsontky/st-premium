    <p>Af­ter be­ing re-elected pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore Sail­ing Fed­er­a­tion at Tues­day’s vir­tual an­nual gen­eral meet­ing (AGM), Dr Lin­coln Chee pledged to sup­port na­tional sailors bid­ding to qual­ify for the Tokyo Olympics.</p>
    <p>He also high­lighted the need to be for­ward think­ing, par­tic­u­larly with new events like a mixed twop­er­son off­shore race and a mixed kite­board­ing re­lay, which will both de­but at the 2024 Paris Games.</p>
    <p>Dr Chee, 56, said: “We will be en­gag­ing our stake­hold­ers and club mem­bers to see how sail­ing ac­tiv­i­ties can be re­sumed fully as it is an im­por­tant part of our phys­i­cal and men­tal well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>“We also want to en­cour­age our sailors who are still cam­paign­ing for the Olympic Games to not stop pur­su­ing their dreams and we are all be­hind their ef­forts.”</p>
    <p>He sin­gled out 49erFX skiff duo Kim­berly Lim and Ce­cilia Low, who are the reign­ing Asian Games cham­pi­ons and have earned their spot at next year’s Olympics, as well as ju­nior kite­foiler Max­i­m­il­ian Maeder.</p>
    <p>The 13-year-old ranked 17th of 122 at the 2019 Kite­foil World Se­ries, was the Asian cham­pion at the 2019 For­mu­late Kite Asian Cham­pi­onships in Bei­hai, China and Sin­ga­pore’s sole rep­re­sen­ta­tive at the 2019 World Beach Games in Qatar.</p>
    <p>This year’s AGM was orig­i­nally planned for be­fore June 30 but was post­poned be­cause of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Be­sides Dr Chee, Pamela Goh was also re-elected as a vice-pres­i­dent while new­com­ers in the ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee in­cluded 2006 Asian Games cham­pion Roy Tay (vicepres­i­dent) and 2005 SEA Games cham­pion Tok Lee Ching (deputy trea­surer). They will all serve un­til 2022.</p>
    <p>Tay, 37, cap­tured two sil­ver medals at last year’s SEA Games in the Philip­pines and said his ex­pe­ri­ences as an ath­lete will be key. He added: “It is only nat­u­ral to make good use of the knowl­edge and ex­pe­ri­ence gained and help pave the way for the young ones, like how my se­niors did for me.”</p>
    <p>Tok, a for­mer ad­min­is­tra­tor at na­tional agency Sin­ga­pore Sports Coun­cil (now Sport Sin­ga­pore) and is now a lec­turer at Nanyang Polytech­nic, hopes to make sail­ing and wind­surf­ing more ac­ces­si­ble.</p>
    <p>She noted: “Sail­ing and wind­surf­ing are fun sports that can be en­joyed by ev­ery­one. I had the op­por­tu­nity to train and com­pete at a high level. This is made pos­si­ble be­cause of the clubs, fa­cil­i­ties and coach­ing per­son­nel.”</p>
