    <p>Veteran lo­cal ac­tress Chen Meiguang, who moved many to tears with her ren­di­tion of the Chi­nese song A Lit­tle Flower at a show in 2007, has died at the age of 87.</p>
    <p>Her only child, Mr Huang Yi, 65, told Chi­nese daily Lianhe Wan­bao that her do­mes­tic helper alerted him last Satur­day af­ter she was un­able to wake Chen up for break­fast.</p>
    <p>He im­me­di­ately called for an am­bu­lance and his mother was taken to Sengkang Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal. The doc­tors there per­formed a brain scan on Chen and found that she had cere­bral haem­or­rhage.</p>
    <p>Mr Huang said his mother re­gained con­scious­ness briefly and men­tioned that the Sin­ga­pore Broad­cast­ing Corporatio­n, pre­cur­sor to Me­di­a­corp, had asked her to go back to film tele­vi­sion shows.</p>
    <p>She died at about 8am in her sleep on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Huang said his mother had been us­ing the wheel­chair in the past six to seven years and suf­fered from de­men­tia in the last two years.</p>
    <p>“A month ago, my mother would men­tion the names of veteran ac­tors from time to time, say­ing once that Un­cle Bai Yan is look­ing for her,” he was quoted by Wan­bao as say­ing.</p>
    <p>Veteran lo­cal ac­tor Bai died in Au­gust last year, months af­ter cel­e­brat­ing his 100th birth­day.</p>
    <p>Chen and Bai had ap­peared to­gether at Me­di­a­corp’s 30th Drama An­niver­sary Show in 2012.</p>
    <p>Chen left the Tele­vi­sion Corporatio­n of Sin­ga­pore in 1998 due to health rea­sons, but re­turned to act­ing on an ad-hoc ba­sis, act­ing in tele­vi­sion se­ri­als like Leg­end Of The Eight Im­mor­tals (1998).</p>
    <p>Mr Huang said his mother’s big­gest re­gret is not re­ceiv­ing the Spe­cial Achieve­ment Award at the Star Awards.</p>
    <p>Ac­tor Xie Shaoguang, who won the award in 2003, said then that the award should go to Chen in­stead, as she was some­one that younger ac­tors should learn from.</p>
    <p>Chen, who was born in Muar, Jo­hor, in 1933, was a so­prano be­fore be­com­ing an ac­tress in the 1980s. She joined a singing con­test at age 15 and later per­formed at getais.</p>
    <p>She used to teach singing and one of her stu­dents was Dawn Yip of the Jean Yip hair­dress­ing busi­ness, who won a national singing con­test in 1979.</p>
    <p>Chen once told an in­ter­viewer that her favourite role is that of a morally am­bigu­ous cig­a­rette seller in Five Foot Way (1987).</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, she was mainly re­mem­bered by many for her ren­di­tion of A Lit­tle Flower.</p>
    <p>She sang the song at the Star Awards 25th Drama An­niver­sary in 2007, mov­ing many to tears.</p>
    <p>She sub­se­quently per­formed the song at Me­di­a­corp char­ity shows in 2008 and 2011, at­tract­ing a large num­ber of calls for do­na­tions.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Wan­bao, Chen was in­vited to sing at six con­certs af­ter the char­ity show in 2008, singing one song a con­cert.</p>
    <p>Chen’s wake will be held from to­mor­row at Block 546 Hougang Street 51, with the funeral tak­ing place on Fri­day.</p>
