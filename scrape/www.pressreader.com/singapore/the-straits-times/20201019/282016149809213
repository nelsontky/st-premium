    <p>Re­marks made in Par­lia­ment by Work­ers’ Party MP Ja­mus Lim on the topic of a min­i­mum wage last week have drawn a strong re­sponse from sev­eral union­ists.</p>
    <p>In Face­book posts and a se­ries of forum let­ters to The Straits Times and Chi­nese daily Lianhe Zaobao, union lead­ers have ac­cused As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Lim, an MP for Sengkang GRC, of be­lit­tling the work that they have put into tri­par­tite ne­go­ti­a­tions over the years.</p>
    <p>They es­pe­cially took is­sue with his choice of words in char­ac­ter­is­ing their views on the is­sue of lowwage work­ers’ in­comes as “folksy wis­dom and be­liefs”.</p>
    <p>Prof Lim em­ployed the phrase dur­ing an ex­change with Na­tional Trades Union Congress deputy sec­re­tary-gen­eral Koh Poh Koon on the pro­gres­sive wage model (PWM) and min­i­mum wage dur­ing the de­bate on the Gov­ern­ment’s strate­gies to tackle Covid-19 last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Dr Koh had said the PWM – a wage lad­der that sets out min­i­mum pay and train­ing re­quire­ments for work­ers at dif­fer­ent skill lev­els – has seen sig­nif­i­cant achieve­ment.</p>
    <p>He added that tak­ing a ne­go­ti­ated ap­proach with stake­hold­ers, in­clud­ing veteran union lead­ers, is im­por­tant. “Re­search, reams and reams of data and re­search is good, but in prac­tice, it’s al­ways harder to do be­cause there are practical con­sid­er­a­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Prof Lim said: “With all due re­spect, as much as it will be lovely to al­ways rely on folksy wis­dom and be­liefs by labour union lead­ers, at the same time, it’s im­por­tant to re­alise that when we talk about stud­ies that show that the min­i­mum wage does not lead to any ap­pre­cia­ble in­crease in un­em­ploy­ment, this is based on care­ful con­sid­er­a­tion and not just be­liefs.”</p>
    <p>Be­liefs, he said, are not the same as ev­i­dence, and ev­i­dence from around the world shows that a min­i­mum wage does not cause wide­spread un­em­ploy­ment, as long as it is not set too high.</p>
    <p>In a let­ter to The Straits Times Forum page last Satur­day, Mr Na­sor­din Mohd Hashim, the for­mer pres­i­dent of the Build­ing Con­struc­tion and Tim­ber In­dus­tries Em­ploy­ees’ Union (Batu), said Prof Lim’s com­ments were “re­gret­ful”.</p>
    <p>He said: “(The com­ments were) not just be­lit­tling our hard work all these years, but also seem­ingly putting down the in­tri­cate is­sues in­volved in out­sourced in­dus­tries such as clean­ing, land­scape and lift main­te­nance.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim Teck Chuan, gen­eral sec­re­tary of the Metal In­dus­tries Work­ers’ Union (Miwu), in a let­ter to Lianhe Zaobao last Satur­day, said he found Prof Lim’s “tone and choice of words dis­re­spect­ful to thou­sands of union lead­ers”.</p>
    <p>Miwu, he said, has played a role in fi­nal­is­ing PWM for the lift and es­ca­la­tor sec­tor af­ter 20 months of ne­go­ti­a­tions, in­clud­ing hours of work spent walk­ing the ground.</p>
    <p>“The whole process in for­mu­lat­ing this PWM is not based on mere ‘folksy be­liefs’ – it is thor­oughly ne­go­ti­ated based on hard data and a firm grasp of cur­rent work­ers’ is­sues,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Union of Se­cu­rity Em­ploy­ees (USE) and Sup­ply Chain Em­ploy­ees’</p>
    <p>Union last Thurs­day, in sep­a­rate Face­book posts, said their mem­bers have walked the ground and im­proved con­di­tions for work­ers. Among other things, USE helped to in­tro­duce the adop­tion of PWM as a li­cens­ing con­di­tion for all se­cu­rity agen­cies.</p>
    <p>USE gen­eral sec­re­tary Ray­mond Chin re­it­er­ated these points in a Forum let­ter to ST pub­lished today.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, Prof Lim, in a Face­book post, said his ar­gu­ment about how “folksy wis­dom” should not form the ba­sis for pol­icy was made in ref­er­ence to be­liefs held by some union lead­ers about the min­i­mum wage, as cited by Dr Koh.</p>
    <p>He added that there was a role for opin­ion based on per­sonal ex­pe­ri­ence, but pol­icy should be for­mu­lated on the ba­sis of “data-driven em­pir­i­cal ev­i­dence”, and that it is im­por­tant “not to con­flate the two, by us­ing an opin­ion to re­fute a study”.</p>
    <p>Said Prof Lim: “There are many ar­eas where I re­spect the views of union lead­ers, such as their em­pa­thetic rep­re­sen­ta­tion of work­ers un­der their charge, their abil­ity to ne­go­ti­ate with busi­ness own­ers, and their hard work in sup­port of work­ers’ rights.”</p>
    <p>Prof Lim, in a forum let­ter to ST pub­lished today, re­it­er­ated his view of union­ists.</p>
    <p>He said his dis­agree­ment with Dr Koh on what should be con­sid­ered in mak­ing pol­icy de­ci­sions “in no way di­min­ishes my re­gard for union­ists in these other ways, nor does it take away from my ap­pre­ci­a­tion of their work in the past”.</p>
