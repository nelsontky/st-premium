    <p>LONDON • Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son said yes­ter­day that he would im­pose tougher re­stric­tions on Eng­land shortly to con­tain a rapidly es­ca­lat­ing coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>Cases of Covid-19 have risen sharply in Bri­tain in re­cent weeks, fu­elled by a new and more trans­mis­si­ble vari­ant. On Sun­day, there were nearly 55,000 new cases. In to­tal, more than 75,000 peo­ple with Covid-19 have died – the sec­ond-high­est toll in Europe.</p>
    <p>Vis­it­ing a hos­pi­tal to see the first peo­ple re­ceive the vac­cine made by Ox­ford Univer­sity and As­traZeneca, Mr John­son said the coun­try faced “tough, tough” weeks to come. “If you look at the num­bers, there’s no ques­tion that we’re go­ing to have to take tougher mea­sures and we’ll be an­nounc­ing those in due course,” he said. “We’ve got the virus re­ally surg­ing.”</p>
    <p>Eng­land is cur­rently di­vided into four tiers of re­stric­tions, with the vast ma­jor­ity of the ter­ri­tory in tiers three and four where so­cial mix­ing is re­stricted and res­tau­rants and pubs are closed. Mr John­son also in­di­cated they may need to re­think a plan to re­open schools for stu­dents aged be­tween 11 and 18.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain yes­ter­day touted a sci­en­tific “tri­umph” as dial­y­sis pa­tient Brian Pinker, 82, who has kid­ney dis­ease, be­came the first per­son to get the Ox­ford/As­traZeneca shot out­side of a trial.</p>
    <p>“I am so pleased to be get­ting the Covid vac­cine to­day and re­ally proud that it is one that was in­vented in Ox­ford,” Mr Pinker, a re­tired main­te­nance man­ager, said just a few hun­dred me­tres from where the vac­cine was de­vel­oped.</p>
    <p>It is the sea­son of New Year gath­er­ings and par­ties, and I must re­it­er­ate the re­quest for peo­ple to avoid go­ing out for un­nec­es­sary pur­poses.</p>
