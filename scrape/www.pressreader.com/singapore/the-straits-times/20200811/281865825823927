    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia’s former top gov­ern­ment au­di­tor Ambrin Buang told the High Court yes­ter­day that it was “in­sult­ing” to him that the 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had (1MDB) chief was al­lowed to re­view an au­dit re­port by his depart­ment on the state fund, page by page, be­fore it was pub­lished.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Ambrin, now re­tired, also said it was “ab­nor­mal” when an au­di­tee was able to re­view the re­port and sit in at a meet­ing with other stake­hold­ers, which re­sulted in sev­eral amend­ments be­ing made to 1MDB’s au­dit re­port in Fe­bru­ary 2016.</p>
    <p>The former au­di­tor-gen­eral said this dur­ing cross-ex­am­i­na­tion by lead de­fence coun­sel Muham­mad Shafee Ab­dul­lah, who is rep­re­sent­ing former premier Na­jib Razak in the au­dit-tam­per­ing trial.</p>
    <p>Mr Ambrin, 71, told the court: “I find it in­sult­ing when the au­di­tee is given the honour of re­view­ing our re­port page by page, para­graph by para­graph.</p>
    <p>“I was told to keep my opin­ion to my­self and write a book about it. How could I be happy?”</p>
    <p>Mr Ambrin was re­fer­ring to a meet­ing held on Feb 24, 2016, at the of­fice of then chief sec­re­tary to the gov­ern­ment Ali Hamsa.</p>
    <p>The meet­ing was at­tended by 1MDB’s chief ex­ec­u­tive at the time, Arul Kanda Kan­dasamy, along with rep­re­sen­ta­tives from the At­tor­neyGen­eral’s Cham­bers and the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice.</p>
    <p>The court had ear­lier heard tes­ti­monies that there was an agree­ment to omit four is­sues from the au­dit re­port, in­clud­ing the is­sue of two con­flict­ing fi­nan­cial state­ments and over the pres­ence of fugi­tive busi­ness­man Low Taek Jho at 1MDB meet­ings.</p>
    <p>Na­jib has been charged with abus­ing his po­si­tion to or­der amend­ments to the 1MDB fi­nal au­dit re­port to avoid any ac­tion be­ing taken against him, while Arul Kanda is charged with abet­ting Na­jib in mak­ing the amend­ments to the re­port.</p>
    <p>If found guilty, they could face up to 20 years in jail and fined no less than five times the amount of grat­i­fi­ca­tion or RM10,000 (S$3,300).</p>
    <p>Mr Ambrin, in his tes­ti­mony, said au­di­tors should be free to ex­press their opin­ion in their re­ports as this is the nor­mal prac­tice.</p>
    <p>He also said his team had to do “ab­nor­mal” things be­yond nor­mal prac­tice dur­ing the Feb 24 meet­ing, be­fore the re­port was sub­mit­ted to Par­lia­ment’s bi­par­ti­san Pub­lic Ac­counts Com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>He added that the 1MDB au­dit was spe­cial as it was man­dated by the Cab­i­net un­der Na­jib at the time and the Na­tional Au­dit Depart­ment. Mr Ambrin said that Na­jib’s then prin­ci­pal pri­vate sec­re­tary, Tan Sri Shukry Salleh, as well as Tan Sri Ali ex­pressed the need for the re­port to be amended to avoid the opposition “spin­ning” its con­tents.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cross-ex­am­i­na­tion, Shafee asked the wit­ness if some­one had “pointed a gun to his head” to make him change the con­tents of the re­port, and Mr Ambrin dis­agreed.</p>
    <p>To a ques­tion on whether Na­jib’s former prin­ci­pal pri­vate sec­re­tary, Mr Shukry, had specif­i­cally pressured him to make the changes, Mr Ambrin an­swered “no”.</p>
    <p>The trial be­fore Jus­tice Mohamed Zaini Ma­zlan will con­tinue to­mor­row. There are five tri­als cov­er­ing a to­tal of 42 crim­i­nal charges against Na­jib, mainly over cor­rup­tion and money laun­der­ing re­lated to 1MDB that took place soon af­ter he be­came prime min­is­ter in 2009.</p>
    <p>Na­jib was, on July 28, found guilty of three counts of crim­i­nal breach of trust, three counts of money laun­der­ing and one count of abuse of power over RM42 mil­lion linked to SRC In­ter­na­tional, a former 1MDB sub­sidiary.</p>
    <p>He was sen­tenced to 12 years in jail and fined RM210 mil­lion. He has ap­pealed against the con­vic­tions.</p>
    <p>I was told to keep my opin­ion to my­self and write a book about it. How could I be happy? ’’</p>
