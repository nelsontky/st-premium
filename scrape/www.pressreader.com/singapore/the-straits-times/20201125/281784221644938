    <p>Parit Chi­warak, 22, of­fered a firm hand­shake rather than a tra­di­tional Thai “wai” by way of greet­ing be­fore the in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>He in­sists on ad­dress­ing Thai­land’s King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn sim­ply as “Va­ji­ra­longkorn”, be­cause “we are all equal as hu­mans”.</p>
    <p>Fac­ing sev­eral charges, he says he is ready to be jailed again if he is con­victed of in­sult­ing or de­fam­ing the monar­chy – a threat Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha raised last week when he hinted at en­forc­ing “all the per­tain­ing laws” against young pro­test­ers who have been mass­ing on the streets for months de­mand­ing con­sti­tu­tional change and monar­chy re­form.</p>
    <p>Reuters, cit­ing a po­lice source yes­ter­day, said seven protest lead­ers have been sum­moned to face charges of lese ma­jeste and have up to next Mon­day to an­swer the sum­monses. Last night, Parit re­vealed that he was one of them.</p>
    <p>“We have al­ready over­come the fear,” Parit, a Tham­masat Univer­sity po­lit­i­cal sci­ence stu­dent, told The Straits Times from the univer­sity’s cam­pus in Pathum Thani, dur­ing one of his rare breaks from criss-cross­ing the coun­try to speak at pro-democ­racy ral­lies with stu­dents as young as 14 in tow.</p>
    <p>Like other key lead­ers of the move­ment that now calls it­self “Rat­sadon” – which means “the peo­ple” – Parit is gear­ing up for the next big demon­stra­tion today in Bangkok, in what would be one of the most di­rect chal­lenges yet to the monarch.</p>
    <p>The King, who keeps a home in Ger­many, took con­trol of two army units, as well as the Crown Prop­erty Bureau’s es­ti­mated US$40 bil­lion (S$54 bil­lion) worth of as­sets, af­ter he as­cended the throne. Al­most nine bil­lion baht (S$398 mil­lion) of this year’s na­tional bud­get has been al­lo­cated for di­rect royal ex­penses, though the to­tal amount in re­lated ex­pen­di­ture is far higher – some­thing pro­test­ers find un­palat­able amid Covid-19-in­duced hard­ship.</p>
    <p>To Parit, this is money that could be spent on im­prov­ing ed­u­ca­tion, trans­port and the wel­fare sys­tem.</p>
    <p>To roy­al­ists who grew up rever­ing the monar­chy, such ques­tions</p>
    <p>are sac­ri­le­gious. Wear­ing yel­low, they have gath­ered in the thou­sands to greet the monarch dur­ing his cur­rent un­usu­ally long so­journ in Thai­land, and been re­warded with self­ies and even au­to­graphs from the pre­vi­ously aloof King.</p>
    <p>Roy­al­ists have ac­cused the young pro­test­ers of be­ing rude and ag­gres­sive in their lan­guage.</p>
    <p>Parit, bet­ter known by his nick­name Pen­guin, ar­gues that they are just us­ing words – and these are noth­ing com­pared with state vi­o­lence against peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“These are not vul­gar­i­ties. They are ex­pres­sions of peo­ple who</p>
    <p>have long been op­pressed. Those who have not been op­pressed and who are point­ing their fin­gers de­mand­ing our protests be run po­litely, don’t un­der­stand this suf­fer­ing,” he says. “They are stand­ing on the side of the op­pres­sor.”</p>
    <p>While the monarch called Thai­land “the land of com­pro­mise” in an ear­lier im­promptu in­ter­view, pro­test­ers saw the doors for ne­go­ti­a­tion close last week when Par­lia­ment voted down a con­sti­tu­tional amend­ment pro­posal sub­mit­ted by an al­lied or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Po­lice also re­sorted to us­ing tear gas and chem­i­cal-laced wa­ter can­non to keep demon­stra­tors away from Par­lia­ment, spark­ing al­le­ga­tions of bru­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>Parit says Thai­land is now a “neo-ab­so­lute monar­chy” un­der which the young gen­er­a­tion have noth­ing more to lose.</p>
    <p>“It’s like liv­ing with­out hope,” says the son of a golf coach and ac­coun­tant, who at­tended the elite Triam Udom Suksa high school.</p>
    <p>In­sult­ing or de­fam­ing the Thai king, queen or heir ap­par­ent risks a jail sen­tence of up to 15 years, and al­leged of­fend­ers are of­ten not granted bail pend­ing trial. But Mr Prayut re­vealed in June that King Va­ji­ra­longkorn or­dered that the lese ma­jeste law not be used against civil­ians.</p>
    <p>In­vok­ing this law now will spur more peo­ple to join the move­ment, says Parit.</p>
    <p>The sea­soned stu­dent ac­tivist, who has been fronting the protests since they erupted in Fe­bru­ary, spent two weeks in jail last month af­ter he was de­nied bail for protest-re­lated of­fences.</p>
    <p>Asked if he would change any­thing if he had to do it all over again, he pauses – but only briefly.</p>
    <p>“We are highly united now. We air the same de­mands in ev­ery protest. It was dif­fer­ent some months ago, when this group wanted this and another group had dif­fer­ent ideas,” he says.</p>
    <p>“If I could start over, I would have raised the is­sue of monar­chy re­form ear­lier so that we could reach this con­clu­sion faster.”</p>
