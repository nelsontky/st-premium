    <p>A vac­cine de­vel­oped by Ox­ford Univer­sity and bio­phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firm As­traZeneca has been found to be up to 90 per cent ef­fec­tive at pre­vent­ing Covid-19, ac­cord­ing to pre­lim­i­nary re­sults. It joins two other vac­cine front run­ners.</p>
    <p>Late-stage hu­man tri­als for the Covid-19 vac­cine de­vel­oped by Ox­ford Univer­sity and bio­phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany As­traZeneca showed that the vac­cine could be up to 90 per cent ef­fec­tive at pre­vent­ing the dis­ease, the com­pany said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A lower dose ap­peared to be more ef­fec­tive than a higher one, pre­lim­i­nary re­sults showed.</p>
    <p>Un­der the dos­ing reg­i­men where vol­un­teers were first given half a dose, fol­lowed by a full dose at least one month apart, the vac­cine ef­fi­cacy was 90 per cent. But when vol­un­teers were given two full doses at least one month apart, the ef­fi­cacy was 62 per cent.</p>
    <p>The com­bined anal­y­sis from both dos­ing reg­i­mens in­volv­ing more than 11,000 vol­un­teers re­sulted in an av­er­age ef­fi­cacy of 70 per cent, As­traZeneca said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>More data will con­tinue to ac­cu­mu­late and ad­di­tional anal­y­sis will be con­ducted, it added. This will help to im­prove the ef­fi­cacy read­ing and es­tab­lish the du­ra­tion of pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor An­drew Pol­lard, chief in­ves­ti­ga­tor of the Ox­ford vac­cine trial at the univer­sity, said the find­ings showed that the vac­cine was ef­fec­tive. “Ex­cit­ingly, we have found that one of our dos­ing reg­i­mens may be around 90 per cent ef­fec­tive and if this dos­ing regime is used, more people could be vac­ci­nated with planned vac­cine sup­ply,” he added.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, As­traZeneca stopped giv­ing shots of its vac­cine af­ter a per­son par­tic­i­pat­ing in one of its stud­ies got sick, al­though the tri­als were later al­lowed to re­sume.</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca said in yes­ter­day’s state­ment that no se­ri­ous safety events re­lated to the vac­cine have been con­firmed, and that the vac­cine was well tol­er­ated across both dos­ing reg­i­mens.</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Pas­cal So­riot said: “The vac­cine’s sim­ple sup­ply chain and our no­profit pledge and com­mit­ment to broad, eq­ui­table and timely ac­cess means it will be af­ford­able and glob­ally avail­able, sup­ply­ing hun­dreds of mil­lions of doses on ap­proval.”</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s up­date f rom As­traZeneca comes af­ter Pfizer, BioNTech and Moderna – the com­pa­nies be­hind two other Covid-19 vac­cine front run­ners – re­vealed pos­i­tive re­sults from their own late-stage tri­als. The firms have said their vac­cines were more than 90 per cent ef­fec­tive at pre­vent­ing the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence, Prof Pol­lard said it was dif­fi­cult to ex­plain the dif­fer­ences in the re­sults in the ab­sence of pub­lished data sets for the dif­fer­ent vac­cines.</p>
    <p>“We don’t know ex­actly what ev­ery­one is mea­sur­ing in the tri­als un­til we have ac­tu­ally got those full data sets out and we can see ex­actly what ev­ery­one has,” he said, adding that the re­searchers be­hind the Ox­ford and As­traZeneca vac­cine plan to sub­mit their own data for pub­li­ca­tion in the days ahead.</p>
    <p>Ox­ford Univer­sity’s Pro­fes­sor Sarah Gil­bert added that the world would need mul­ti­ple vac­cines be­cause no one de­vel­oper or man­u­fac­turer will be able to pro­duce enough doses to meet global de­mand.</p>
    <p>She added: “It is re­ally ex­cel­lent to see that the high ef­fi­cacy that we are now get­ting out of these tri­als – cou­pled with the safety, the abil­ity to man­u­fac­ture i n l arge doses, the abil­ity to feed into ex­ist­ing dis­tri­bu­tion net­works for vac­cines that al­ready are in place around the world – be­cause all of that to­gether is go­ing to re­ally make a dif­fer­ence to get a lot of people vac­ci­nated.”</p>
    <p>The fi­nan­cial mar­kets ral­lied and in­vestors re­joiced af­ter Amer­i­can drug gi­ant Pfizer, to­gether with Ger­man drug­maker BioNTech, re­leased bet­ter-than-ex­pected pre­lim­i­nary trial re­sults ear­lier this month of their Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­date.</p>
    <p>Pfizer’s vac­cine an­nounce­ment is promis­ing and there are good rea­sons to be op­ti­mistic. Early data from the fi­nal-stage trial showed that the drug has a more than 90 per cent ef­fi­cacy rate.</p>
    <p>For per­spec­tive, no vac­cine is ever 100 per cent ef­fec­tive. Even the measles vac­cine, one of the most suc­cess­ful vac­cines in mod­ern his­tory, has an ef­fi­cacy rate of about 93 per cent. A week later, Amer­i­can biotech­nol­ogy com­pany Moderna an­nounced that its ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cine was 94.5 per cent ef­fec­tive. This is im­por­tant be­cause a range of ef­fi­ca­cious vac­cines need to be pro­duced at suf­fi­cient scale to in­oc­u­late the global pop­u­la­tion. How­ever, sev­eral un­cer­tain­ties re­main.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear how dif­fer­ent age groups will re­spond to the Pfizer vac­cine. Elderly people, whose im­mune sys­tems are gen­er­ally weaker, may not pro­duce strong im­mune re­sponses com­pared with younger in­di­vid­u­als. It is also un­known whether people who have re­ceived the jabs are still con­ta­gious, es­pe­cially if they are asymp­to­matic and do not fall ill.</p>
    <p>The dura­bil­ity of the vac­cine is also un­clear. Reg­u­lar booster shots may still be re­quired to en­sure the long-term ef­fi­cacy of the drug. Po­ten­tial side ef­fects from the vac­cine have not been com­pre­hen­sively doc­u­mented at this point.</p>
    <p>Clar­ity on these con­cerns re­quires more in­ves­ti­ga­tion, data and time. So, while there is light at the end of the tun­nel, the road ahead re­mains rocky for the world and in­vestors alike.</p>
    <p>In­deed, we ex­pect mar­ket sen­ti­ment to vac­il­late be­tween op­ti­mism that the vac­cine will rid the world of the virus and fears that gov­ern­ments will en­force strict con­tain­ment mea­sures in the in­terim to con­tain its spread.</p>
    <p>How quickly the global econ­omy can bounce back from the pan­demic de­pends on sev­eral fac­tors.</p>
    <p>The first con­sid­er­a­tion is how quickly vac­cines can be pro­duced and at what scale.</p>
    <p>Es­sen­tially, this is a ques­tion of ca­pac­ity. In­ter­na­tional reg­u­la­tory har­mon­i­sa­tion as it per­tains to the Covid-19 vac­cine is an­other chal­lenge. While na­tional reg­u­la­tors have been will­ing and quick to stream­line bu­reau­cratic red tape and fast-track clin­i­cal trial ap­provals for vac­cine re­search, a lack of har­mon­i­sa­tion be­tween na­tional reg­u­la­tions might be a hur­dle for quick im­ple­men­ta­tion on an in­ter­na­tional scale.</p>
    <p>Dis­tri­bu­tion of a vac­cine is in­ex­tri­ca­bly linked to pric­ing. Richer coun­tries will be able to se­cure ini­tial sup­plies more quickly than less wealthy and more pop­u­lous coun­tries.</p>
    <p>These chal­lenges are not in­sur­mount­able. In­stead, there is a high level of con­fi­dence that gov­ern­ments will be able to move past these hur­dles and muster the re­sources avail­able to sup­port a world­wide im­mu­ni­sa­tion ef­fort. But it takes time and it is un­likely to be a smooth ride. Ul­ti­mately, un­til a vac­cine can be widely dis­trib­uted and ad­min­is­tered, con­tain­ing the virus will be a top pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>While near-term eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity might still take a hit from such tar­geted con­tain­ment mea­sures, we do not ex­pect a re­peat of the his­toric lev­els of eco­nomic con­trac­tions we saw in the sec­ond quar­ter of this year.</p>
    <p>Ef­fec­tive ther­a­peu­tics, so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures and a ro­bust con­tact trac­ing regime will re­main es­sen­tial as a bridge to a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, with the elec­tion hump largely out of the way, there should be fur­ther clar­ity to the United States’ pol­icy out­look. Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s de­ci­sive vic­tory and stead­fast fo­cus in deal­ing with Covid-19 should bol­ster in­vestor sen­ti­ment.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket volatil­ity will re­main a fix­ture. Ul­ti­mately, in­vestors should not miss the for­est for the trees.</p>
    <p>But the longer-term out­look is cer­tainly get­ting brighter.</p>
    <p>Hence, it is the time to en­gage in higher-risk in­vest­ments, which un­der­pins our pos­i­tive view on eq­ui­ties gen­er­ally. In the face of tur­bu­lence, in­vestors should di­ver­sify the tim­ing of their mar­ket en­try by adopt­ing a dol­lar cost av­er­ag­ing ap­proach.</p>
    <p>In­vestors should take ad­van­tage of volatil­ity to ac­cu­mu­late more stocks dur­ing pull­backs and fewer stocks when mar­kets rise.</p>
    <p>In­vestors should also con­sider di­ver­si­fy­ing their in­vest­ments into economies that have suc­cess­fully con­tained the virus – such as China, South Korea, Hong Kong and Sin­ga­pore – as they might be well-placed to elim­i­nate Covid-19 en­tirely and quickly once a vac­cine comes through.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, promis­ing vac­cine news had trig­gered a vi­o­lent ro­ta­tion out of growth sec­tors and into value and cycli­cal stocks. The ini­tial vac­cine eupho­ria has grad­u­ally pe­tered out as the fo­cus shifted to con­cerns re­lated to the near-term Covid-19 resur­gence. Yet, the ro­ta­tion to value may not be done en­tirely and could gain mo­men­tum if vac­cine de­vel­op­ments sur­prise on the up­side.</p>
    <p>While it is dif­fi­cult to time such trades, it might be pru­dent for in­vestors with large ex­po­sure to growth sec­tors like tech­nol­ogy to re­bal­ance their port­fo­lio grad­u­ally into cycli­cal and value stocks.</p>
