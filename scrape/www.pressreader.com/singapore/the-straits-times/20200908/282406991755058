    <p>As an arts col­lec­tive with­out a per­ma­nent stu­dio space or full-time dancers, Sigma Con­tem­po­rary Dance was able to min­imise its costs dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Artis­tic di­rec­tor Hong Guofeng, 33, who has been with the com­pany since it started in 2011, says the group was for­tu­nate as this was a “down year” for them, with small projects i n the pipe­line, af­ter a suc­cess­ful an­nual pro­duc­tion last year.</p>
    <p>Af­ter re­hearsals stalled in March, the com­pany went all-in with a dig­i­tal en­deav­our ti­tled Survei:ance, which aptly looked into sur­veil­lance in the dig­i­tal age.</p>
    <p>Mr Hong said the show al­lowed the com­pany to ex­tend its reach to view­ers and dancers overseas. “We saw about 1,000 views for the show, which could not be ac­com­mo­dated in a phys­i­cal black­box,” he added.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s dancers have re­turned to the stu­dio for re­hearsals and train­ing with few dancers at a time. Com­pany classes have also re­sumed, though all are on­line as Sigma does not have a big phys­i­cal space to house all the dancers with the safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>The com­pany hoped to put out a large-scale pro­duc­tion next year to mark its 10th an­niver­sary. It plans to host a show with sev­eral si­mul­ta­ne­ous per­for­mances in dif­fer­ent parts of the venue, so small groups of au­di­ence mem­bers can be taken on an ex­pe­ri­en­tial dance jour­ney fit for the new nor­mal, one that is so­cially dis­tanced.</p>
