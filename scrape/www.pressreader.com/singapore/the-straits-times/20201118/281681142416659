    <p>It was the sev­enth day with­out lo­cal trans­mis­sion, the long­est such pe­riod since a 12-day streak from Jan 23 to Feb 3.</p>
    <p>There were six new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, all of them im­ported.</p>
    <p>Th­ese peo­ple had been placed on stay-home no­tices on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>It was the sev­enth day with­out lo­cal trans­mis­sion, the long­est such pe­riod since a 12-day streak from Jan 23 to Feb 3.</p>
    <p>The new im­ported cases take Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,130.</p>
    <p>One of the six is a 55-year-old Sin­ga­porean man who re­turned from In­dia. He showed symp­toms on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Three oth­ers are work per­mit hold­ers. Two of them trav­elled from the Philip­pines, and the third ar­rived from Myan­mar. All three are em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore and were asymp­to­matic when tested.</p>
    <p>Of the re­main­ing two cases, one is a de­pen­dant’s pass holder who came from the United King­dom and the other is a long-term visit pass holder who ar­rived from the Philip­pines. They were also asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>MOH said all close con­tacts of the im­ported cases have been iso­lated and will be tested at the start and end of their quar­an­tine pe­riod to de­tect asymp­to­matic cases.</p>
    <p>The min­istry added that the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with no new cases in the past week.</p>
    <p>With six cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,024 pa­tients have re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>There were 37 pa­tients still in hos­pi­tal, and 26 in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. None was in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, and 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, the virus out­break that be­gan last De­cem­ber has in­fected more than 54.8 mil­lion peo­ple. Over 1.32 mil­lion peo­ple have died.</p>
