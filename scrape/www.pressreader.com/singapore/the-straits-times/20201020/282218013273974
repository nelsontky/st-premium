    <p>KUALA LUMPUR Malaysia Air­lines’ par­ent com­pany is still hold­ing ne­go­ti­a­tions with lessors and cred­i­tors over a re­struc­tur­ing plan to keep the car­rier alive, but the talks are tak­ing longer than planned, ac­cord­ing to a staff memo seen by Reuters.</p>
    <p>“The ne­go­ti­a­tions are still on­go­ing and tak­ing longer than the planned time­line, but we are gain­ing en­cour­ag­ing trac­tion from the lessors and cred­i­tors thus far,” Mr Izham Is­mail, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Malaysia Air­lines and group CEO of par­ent Malaysia Avi­a­tion Group (MAG), said in a memo to staff last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to a Reuters query, MAG last Satur­day said in an e-mail that it is “con­tin­u­ing dis­cus­sions with cred­i­tors on its on­go­ing re­struc­tur­ing ex­er­cise”.</p>
    <p>MAG, which is owned by state fund Khaz­anah, said Mr Izham’s memo to staff was to ad­dress con­cerns among em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s na­tional air­line is seek­ing to re­struc­ture af­ter the coro­n­avirus pan­demic forced it to slash op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The car­rier had re­struc­tured af­ter two deadly crashes in 2014 but, un­like at that time, the gov­ern­ment is un­will­ing to bail it out this time.</p>
    <p>Reuters re­ported last week that a group of lessors had re­jected a re­struc­tur­ing plan that in­volved steep dis­counts, bring­ing the car­rier closer to a show­down over its fu­ture.</p>
    <p>In his memo to em­ploy­ees, Mr Izham as­sured them that MAG’s re­struc­tur­ing ex­er­cise “is still work in progress”.</p>
    <p>“Do you see me throw­ing in the towel yet? To­gether with the se­nior lead­er­ship team, we are here still fight­ing for the com­pany’s sur­vival,” Mr Izham said.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, MAG said its sub­sidiary Fire­fly Air­lines will start fly­ing early next year as part of a re­aligned group-wide busi­ness strategy.</p>
    <p>Reuters re­ported last week that MAG had warned lessors that its sole share­holder would wind down the air­line if re­struc­tur­ing talks are un­suc­cess­ful, and would focus on Fire­fly.</p>
