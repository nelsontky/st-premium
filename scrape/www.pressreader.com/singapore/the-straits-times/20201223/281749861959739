    <p>The Euro­pean Com­mis­sion threw Bri­tain a life­line yes­ter­day af­ter it be­came stranded in Covid-19 iso­la­tion, rec­om­mend­ing that EU mem­bers roll back sweep­ing bor­der clo­sures to al­low freight to re­sume and let peo­ple re­turn home for Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>Much of the world shut their bor­ders to Bri­tain af­ter a mu­tated vari­ant of the coro­n­avirus was dis­cov­ered spread­ing swiftly across south­ern Eng­land, halt­ing a chunk of trade with the rest of Europe and leav­ing truck­ers stranded.</p>
    <p>With queues of trucks snaking to the hori­zon in Eng­land and su­per­mar­ket shelves stripped just days be­fore Christ­mas, Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris Johnson scram­bled to get French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron to lift a ban on freight from Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>The EU’s ex­ec­u­tive body has ad­vised that non-es­sen­tial travel to and from Bri­tain should be dis­cour­aged, but said peo­ple head­ing home should be al­lowed to do so, pro­vided they un­dergo a Covid-19 test or quar­an­tine for 10 days.</p>
    <p>“Blan­ket travel bans should not pre­vent thou­sands of EU and UK citizens from re­turn­ing to their homes,” Euro­pean Jus­tice Com­mis­sioner Di­dier Reyn­ders said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Rapid turn­around lat­eral flow tests on lorry driv­ers with the help of the Bri­tish mil­i­tary are ex­pected as part of the mea­sures to un­block cross-chan­nel trade between</p>
    <p>Bri­tain and France, Bri­tish me­dia re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Johnson and his ad­vis­ers said the mu­tated vari­ant of the coro­n­avirus, which could be up to 70 per cent more trans­mis­si­ble, was spread­ing rapidly but that it had been iden­ti­fied be­cause Bri­tish sci­en­tists were ef­fi­cient at ge­nomic sur­veil­lance.</p>
    <p>The BBC cited France’s Europe Min­is­ter Cle­ment Beaune as say­ing that Bri­tain and France would an­nounce a deal to restart freight by to­day.</p>
    <p>“We speak to our col­leagues in France con­stantly on a range of is­sues and that work has been un­der way over the last 24 hours and we’ll con­tinue to­day,” Bri­tish Home Sec­re­tary Priti Pa­tel told Sky News.</p>
    <p>The dis­cov­ery of the new strain, just months be­fore vac­cines are ex­pected to be widely avail­able, sowed a fresh wave of panic in a pan­demic that has killed about 1.7 mil­lion peo­ple world­wide and more than 67,000 in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists say there is no ev­i­dence that vac­cines cur­rently be­ing de­ployed in the UK – made by Pfizer and BioNTech – or other Covid-19 shots in devel­op­ment will not pro­tect against this vari­ant,</p>
    <p>NER­VOUS AND UN­HAPPY</p>
    <p>My chances of go­ing home for Christ­mas are go­ing down. It’s stupid and I am ner­vous and un­happy about that.</p>
    <p>MR STANISLAW OLBRICH, a Pol­ish trucker stuck 40km north of Dover.</p>
    <p>known as the B.1.1.7 lineage.</p>
    <p>The United King­dom is in ef­fec­tive Covid-19 quar­an­tine just nine days be­fore it is due to part ways with the Euro­pean Union af­ter a tran­si­tion pe­riod – con­sid­ered to be one of the big­gest changes in post-World War II Bri­tish his­tory.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries across Europe and be­yond have sus­pended travel from Bri­tain since the week­end.</p>
    <p>Cases of the new strain have also been de­tected in some other coun­tries, in­clud­ing Den­mark and Italy.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s bor­der cri­sis l ed to some panic-buy­ing in the coun­try: shop­pers stripped shelves in some su­per­mar­kets of tur­key, toi­let rolls, bread and veg­eta­bles.</p>
    <p>While the gov­ern­ment said there was enough food for Christ­mas, mar­ket leader Tesco and No. 2 player Sains­bury’s both said food sup­plies would be af­fected if the trans­port dis­rup­tion con­tin­ued.</p>
    <p>Sains­bury’s and Tesco are ex­plor­ing all op­tions to keep sup­plies flow­ing, in­clud­ing the use of planes for some fresh-veg­etable ship­ments in­stead of truck fer­ries, while Deutsche Lufthansa may add ded­i­cated freighter flights to the UK Euro­tun­nel, which op­er­ates the Chan­nel Tun­nel rail link between Bri­tain and France.</p>
    <p>Talks are also un­der way about run­ning ex­tra freight trains.</p>
    <p>Lorry driv­ers said they just wanted to get back home in time for Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>“My chances of go­ing home for Christ­mas are go­ing down. It’s stupid and I am ner­vous and un­happy about that,” said Mr Stanislaw Olbrich, a 55-year-old Pol­ish trucker who was stuck 40km north of Dover.</p>
