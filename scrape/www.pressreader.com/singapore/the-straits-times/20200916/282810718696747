    <p>SEOUL • South Korean ac­tress Oh In-hye died on Mon­day after she was found un­con­scious in her home in In­cheon ear­lier in the day.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to news out­let Dis­patch, the 36-year-old was found in a crit­i­cal con­di­tion at about 5am on Mon­day. She was found un­re­spon­sive by an ac­quain­tance, who called the po­lice and emer­gency ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Oh re­ceived car­diopul­monary re­sus­ci­ta­tion be­fore she was taken to a nearby hos­pi­tal, where her breath­ing and pulse re­port­edly sta­bilised, re­ported The Korea Her­ald.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she did not re­gain con­scious­ness and was pro­nounced dead later in the day.</p>
    <p>The South Korean po­lice are in­ves­ti­gat­ing the case as sui­cide.</p>
    <p>A pri­vate ser­vice will be held at the Inha Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal in In­cheon and her funeral will be held to­day.</p>
    <p>Oh de­buted in the film Sin Of A Fam­ily in 2011 and has acted in other movies such as Red Va­cance Black Wed­ding (2011) and A Jour­ney With Korean Masters (2013).</p>
    <p>She grabbed head­lines dur­ing the Bu­san In­ter­na­tional Film Fes­ti­val in 2011 when she wore a re­veal­ing dress on the red car­pet.</p>
