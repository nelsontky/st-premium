    <p>As a transat­lantic re­set looms on the hori­zon af­ter United States Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den takes charge of for­eign pol­icy next year, Ger­many be­lieves a re­set in re­la­tions with China should fol­low.</p>
    <p>Tra­di­tion­ally re­served in its for­eign pol­icy, Ger­many was at the fore­front of a push­back from Europe when Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump threat­ened a trade war and un­der­mined both the Euro­pean Union (EU) and the North At­lantic Treaty Or­gan­i­sa­tion by en­cour­ag­ing Bri­tain’s exit from the EU and ac­cus­ing Euro­pean gov­ern­ments of not spend­ing enough to­wards their own se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Ger­many now wants the West to play as a team again, a sen­ti­ment Ger­man lead­ers ex­pressed soon af­ter Mr Bi­den staked a claim to the White House af­ter elec­tions last week.</p>
    <p>With the re­shap­ing of the in­ter­na­tional or­der that is ex­pected as Mr Bi­den adopts a more mul­ti­lat­er­al­ist ap­proach, Ger­man De­fence Min­is­ter An­negret Kramp-Kar­ren­bauer be­lieves the West and other like-minded part­ners must square up to an in­creas­ingly as­sertive China.</p>
    <p>“To be com­pet­i­tive eco­nom­i­cally and po­lit­i­cally, I be­lieve it is cru­cial that we like-minded states need to come up with a more uni­fied ef­fort in our deal­ings with Bei­jing,” Mrs Kramp-Kar­ren­bauer said in an ex­clu­sive in­ter­view with The Straits Times from Ber­lin yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Asked if Ger­many ex­pected to see a twin­ning of aims with the in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion, she would not com­ment specif­i­cally but said it was China’s own be­hav­iour that had caused na­tions to reeval­u­ate poli­cies.</p>
    <p>“The way Ger­many and many other coun­tries have adapted their views and poli­cies con­cern­ing China has to do with China it­self. Bei­jing’s poli­cies and con­duct are more of a rea­son for con­cern now than they were a few years ago. This has trig­gered a re­think,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ger­many and China have en­joyed strong ties – Ger­many is China’s most im­por­tant trad­ing part­ner in Europe and Ger­man com­pa­nies have in­vested in China as a man­u­fac­tur­ing and re­search base – but Mrs Kramp-Kar­ren­bauer spoke of an un­fair re­la­tion­ship. She said: “We do not turn a blind eye to un­equal in­vest­ment con­di­tions, ag­gres­sive ap­pro­pri­a­tion of in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty, state­sub­sidised dis­tor­tion of com­pe­ti­tion or at­tempts to ex­ert in­flu­ence by means of loans and in­vest­ments.”</p>
    <p>As a con­se­quence, Mrs Kram­pKar­ren­bauer is press­ing for a joint ap­proach to­wards China, es­pe­cially over trade. “At the EU level, Ger­many is in­creas­ingly co­or­di­nat­ing our poli­cies, also to ne­go­ti­ate fair trade deals and in­vest­ment part­ner­ships with as many part­ners as pos­si­ble to di­ver­sify trad­ing re­la­tions,” she said.</p>
    <p>She has floated the idea of a Western trade al­liance, open to any na­tion which wants to strengthen and sup­port the lib­eral, rules­based or­der that has been chal­lenged both by the Chi­nese au­thor­i­tar­ian model as well as the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s trans­ac­tional for­eign pol­icy.</p>
    <p>“The Indo-Pa­cific, with its ma­jor global trade routes in the South China Sea, the In­dian Ocean and the Pa­cific will surely ben­e­fit from strong global reg­u­la­tory frame­work which pro­motes free trade and open sea routes,” she said.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man Cabi­net has re­cently adopted new pol­icy guide­lines for a strat­egy in the Indo-Pa­cific, push­ing for a closer en­gage­ment with the re­gion. In an in­ter­view with Aus­tralian me­dia this month, she said Ger­many needed to mark its po­si­tion in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Asked to elab­o­rate, she said Ger­many would ex­pand se­cu­rity and de­fence co­op­er­a­tion in the re­gion, in­clud­ing with Sin­ga­pore, and pro­mote di­a­logue on mat­ters of se­cu­rity. “Specif­i­cally, this will en­tail the ex­pan­sion of our mar­itime pres­ence in Indo-Pa­cific sea ter­ri­to­ries, or the em­barka­tion of Ger­man navy of­fi­cers on friendly ves­sels, as well as joint ex­er­cises, train­ing, or the dis­patch of li­ai­son of­fi­cers to mul­ti­lat­eral or­gan­i­sa­tions in the re­gion,” she said, cit­ing the post­ing of a Ger­man li­ai­son of­fi­cer at the In­for­ma­tion Fu­sion Centre in Changi Naval Base ear­lier this year as an ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>The re­gional mar­itime se­cu­rity centre, hosted by the Sin­ga­pore navy, fa­cil­i­tates in­for­ma­tion shar­ing and col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Along­side con­ven­tional de­fence threats, Ger­many has also turned its at­ten­tion to threats from dis­in­for­ma­tion cam­paigns that come from across its bor­ders. “We sup­port both the EU task force against dis­in­for­ma­tion and the small cell em­bed­ded with the Euro­pean Ex­ter­nal Ac­tion Ser­vice that is spe­cialised in mon­i­tor­ing and de­bunk­ing Rus­sian dis­in­for­ma­tion cam­paigns,” she said.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands Ger­many has also pro­posed open­ing a new Re­gional Ger­man In­for­ma­tion Centre in Sin­ga­pore next year as it steps up its re­sponse to dis­in­for­ma­tion, adding to the ones it op­er­ates in Cairo, Mex­ico City and Pre­to­ria.</p>
