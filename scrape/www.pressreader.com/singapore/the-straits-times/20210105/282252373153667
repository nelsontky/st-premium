    <p>The de­ploy­ment of ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) tech­nolo­gies will con­tinue un­abated. From au­tomat­ing driver­less cars and fac­tory op­er­a­tions to de­tect­ing cy­ber threats and fraud to pre­dict­ing dis­eases and cus­tomer profitabil­ity, na­tions are look­ing to such tech­nolo­gies to lift economies rav­aged by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>AI seeks to sim­u­late hu­man abil­i­ties such as prob­lem solv­ing, learn­ing, plan­ning and pre­dict­ing. The tech­nol­ogy pro­cesses a vast amount of in­for­ma­tion to pre­dict out­comes, and can do so faster and more ac­cu­rately than hu­mans.</p>
    <p>But it can also run amok.</p>
    <p>In 2018, e-com­merce gi­ant Ama­zon shut down its AI re­cruit­ment en­gine af­ter dis­cov­er­ing it had dis­crim­i­nated against women. Its AI sys­tem used all the job ap­pli­ca­tions it had re­ceived over a 10-year pe­riod to learn how to spot the best can­di­dates. As in many tech­nol­ogy firms, Ama­zon has a low pro­por­tion of women work­ing in the com­pany. The al­go­rithm picked that up and de­cided that male dom­i­nance was a suc­cess fac­tor.</p>
    <p>De­bate about AI ethics and gov­er­nance will con­tinue to heighten in the new year.</p>
    <p>One of the con­ver­sa­tions will be on how much hu­man over­sight and ac­count­abil­ity is needed. For in­stance, should pro­mo­tions be based on AI pre­dic­tions on which em­ployee is most likely to quit?</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, should a com­pany give its AI sys­tem com­plete au­ton­omy in rec­om­mend­ing loy­alty vouch­ers of dif­fer­ent value to dif­fer­ent cus­tomers based on how prof­itable the cus­tomers are and the flight risk they rep­re­sent?</p>
    <p>Or should the AI sys­tem of a hos­pi­tal’s ac­ci­dent and emer­gency depart­ment al­low el­derly pa­tients to jump the queue solely be­cause of their age?</p>
    <p>Also ex­pected this year is more ro­bust dis­cus­sion on data own­er­ship. Per­sonal data is said to be the oil of the 21st cen­tury and is es­sen­tial for com­pa­nies in­volved in AI de­vel­op­ment. This has led ex­perts to sug­gest that con­sumers could own, and thus price and sell, their per­sonal data.</p>
    <p>They believe that greater clar­ity on data own­er­ship will al­low any wealth gained from AI use to be shared. Af­ter all, com­pa­nies ben­e­fit com­mer­cially from us­ing a mas­sive amount of con­sumer data – in­clud­ing in­for­ma­tion on health, In­ter­net use, fa­cial fea­tures, voice pat­terns and lo­ca­tion in­for­ma­tion – to train AI sys­tems.</p>

        <p data-role="text">There are ben&#xAD;e&#xAD;fits to ar&#xAD;ti&#xAD;fi&#xAD;cial in&#xAD;tel&#xAD;li&#xAD;gence tech&#xAD;nolo&#xAD;gies like this one which can pre&#xAD;dict the sever&#xAD;ity of pneu&#xAD;mo&#xAD;nia in a pa&#xAD;tient based on an X-ray im&#xAD;age. But AI can also run amok with un&#xAD;in&#xAD;tended out&#xAD;comes.</p>
