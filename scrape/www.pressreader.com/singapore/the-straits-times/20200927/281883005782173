    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tish tele­vi­sion nat­u­ral­ist David At­ten­bor­ough has joined In­sta­gram at the age of 94, and quickly racked up more than one mil­lion fol­low­ers in just 4 hours and 44 min­utes.</p>
    <p>He broke Hol­ly­wood ac­tress Jen­nifer Anis­ton’s record for the short­est amount of time to reach a mil­lion fol­low­ers on the so­cial me­dia plat­form last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Anis­ton, the star of Amer­i­can tele­vi­sion sit­com Friends, achieved that mile­stone in 5 hours, 16 min­utes last Oc­to­ber, the BBC said.</p>
    <p>Other no­table pub­lic fig­ures who held the record for the fastest to gain a mil­lion fol­low­ers in­clude the Duke and Duchess of Sus­sex and Pope Fran­cis.</p>
    <p>Mr At­ten­bor­ough, a vet­eran broad­caster who has en­joyed a stel­lar 60-year ca­reer chron­i­cling the nat­u­ral world for au­di­ences, used his in­au­gu­ral post on the photo-and video-shar­ing plat­form to warn that “sav­ing our planet is now a com­mu­ni­ca­tions chal­lenge”.</p>
    <p>“I am mak­ing this move and ex­plor­ing this new way of com­mu­ni­ca­tion to me be­cause, as we all know, the world is in trou­ble,” he said in a 1 minute, 12 sec­ond video mes­sage that at­tracted nearly 20,000 com­ments within six hours.</p>
    <p>“Con­ti­nents are on fire. Glaciers are melt­ing. Coral reefs are dy­ing. Fish are dis­ap­pear­ing from our oceans. The list goes on and on,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr At­ten­bor­ough joined the US so­cial me­dia site, which is owned by Face­book, ahead of Net­flix’s Oct 4 re­lease of his lat­est film, A Life On Our Planet.</p>
    <p>The new film, which in­cludes clips from his long ca­reer, was de­layed by the pan­demic. It will premiere in cin­e­mas to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Mr At­ten­bor­ough’s In­sta­gram ac­count will be man­aged by the doc­u­men­tary’s mak­ers and host fur­ther video mes­sages from the man him­self in the com­ing weeks, they said in a mes­sage posted on the web­site.</p>
    <p>“Join me, or as we used to say in those early days of ra­dio, stay tuned,” Mr At­ten­bor­ough added as he con­cluded his first and so far only post.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, he gave his stark­est warn­ing yet on the need for hu­man­ity to safe­guard species from mass ex­tinc­tion for the sake of mankind’s own sur­vival in a one­hour film, Ex­tinc­tion: The Facts.</p>
    <p>It aired on the BBC in Bri­tain in the same week as in­ter­na­tional ex­perts warned in a re­port that global an­i­mal, bird and fish pop­u­la­tions have plum­meted by more than two-thirds in less than 50 years ow­ing to ram­pant over-con­sump­tion by hu­mans.</p>
