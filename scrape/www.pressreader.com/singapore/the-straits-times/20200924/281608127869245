    <p>Op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim, who yes­ter­day claimed he has the ma­jor­ity to form a new government, faces sev­eral key chal­lenges to be­come Malaysia’s ninth prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>There is scep­ti­cism over whether he has se­cured enough law­mak­ers to en­gi­neer the collapse of the Perikatan Na­sional (PN) government, af­ter he de­clined to say how many MPs are be­hind him.</p>
    <p>To win con­trol, Datuk Seri An­war needs at least 112 MPs to back him in the 222-strong Par­lia­ment. He said yes­ter­day that he has more than just “four, five or six” leg­is­la­tors above the min­i­mum needed to form a new government. His Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) coali­tion now has 91 MPs.</p>
    <p>But even if he has the num­bers, an even big­ger ob­sta­cle could await him.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin may still hold the trump card as un­der the Malaysian Con­sti­tu­tion, he has the right to ad­vise the Malaysian King to dis­solve Par­lia­ment and call for a fresh gen­eral election, once he knows that his government is in the mi­nor­ity.</p>
    <p>Dr Oh Ei Sun, a se­nior fel­low at the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of In­ter­na­tional Af­fairs, told The Straits Times: “An­war’s lat­est move would be more con­vinc­ing and thereby re­as­sur­ing pub­lic sen­ti­ments if he were to dis­close his list of par­lia­men­tary sup­port­ers.”</p>
    <p>There were whis­pers yes­ter­day that those who jumped to Mr An­war’s PH coali­tion in­cluded 19 MPs from the Gabun­gan Parti Sarawak (GPS) coali­tion and 10 MPs from Umno. But GPS, a coali­tion of four Sarawak par­ties, yes­ter­day de­nied it was switch­ing camps.</p>
    <p>Other scep­tics re­called that in Septem­ber 2008, the po­lit­i­cal scene was set alight af­ter Mr An­war claimed he had se­cured enough sup­port to top­ple the then Barisan Na­sional (BN) government led by Tun Ab­dul­lah Badawi. But the claim quickly fiz­zled out.</p>
    <p>“We will have to wait to see if this is an­other episode of mak­ing claims that can­not be sub­stan­ti­ated,” former prime min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad said yes­ter­day, as quoted by The Edge Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war, 73, has pur­sued his dream of be­com­ing prime min­is­ter over the last two decades. Since PH was top­pled seven months ago, he has strug­gled to keep his dream alive and dropped a bomb­shell yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Said vet­eran Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party law­maker Lim Kit Siang yes­ter­day: “I have been in Sabah since Sept 14 and have not been in con­tact with An­war, and An­war’s me­dia con­fer­ence to­day is as much a sur­prise to me as to any­one else.”</p>
    <p>Mr An­war’s sup­port­ers at the meet­ing shouted “Re­for­masi!” (re­form) re­peat­edly, see­ing that their leader’s dream is close to be­ing ful­filled.</p>
    <p>But in Malaysia’s fast-paced pol­i­tics, some an­a­lysts be­lieve noth­ing is fixed in stone.</p>
    <p>“I think they are still ne­go­ti­at­ing. An­war’s pre­ferred choice is for Muhyid­din to join his new coali­tion, so the power trans­fer can be very smooth,” Pro­fes­sor James Chin from the Univer­sity of Tas­ma­nia told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war’s best hope is to meet the King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ri’ay­atud­din, to show his list of leg­is­la­tors. The ruler will then ask the reign­ing prime min­is­ter on the next step to take.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din could an­nounce that he has lost the ma­jor­ity and al­low Mr An­war to take over, or ad­vise the King to call for a new gen­eral election.</p>
    <p>What is in­ter­est­ing, ob­servers say, is that af­ter the peace­ful change of government in May 2018, and amid the peace­ful Sabah polls caused by the collapse of the state government, Malaysians will likely take the changes in their stride.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore 2018, a lot of peo­ple in Malaysia be­lieved that if BN falls, there would be riots in the streets. That did not hap­pen in 2018 and 2020,” said Prof Chin.</p>
