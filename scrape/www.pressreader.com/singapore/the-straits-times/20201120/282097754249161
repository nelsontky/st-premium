    <p>The time that women in Asia-Pa­cific spend on house­work daily could count for at least US$10.8 tril­lion (S$14.5 tril­lion) of the global econ­omy an­nu­ally, mak­ing them a pow­er­ful en­gine of growth that economies should tap in their post-pandemic re­cov­ery, said Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob.</p>
    <p>In her speech yesterday at the virtual Women’s Fo­rum Global Meet­ing 2020, she noted: “Asian economies are sit­ting on a pow­er­ful and un­der­utilised en­gine of growth. Ad­vanc­ing gen­der equal­ity in Asia-Pa­cific could mean an ex­tra US$4.5 tril­lion or 12 per cent of the col­lec­tive an­nual GDP... this could also bring in an ad­di­tional $26 bil­lion to Sin­ga­pore’s an­nual GDP over the next 10 years.</p>
    <p>“Pro­mot­ing women em­pow­er­ment is there­fore not just an ideal of fair­ness, but also one that makes eco­nomic sense.”</p>
    <p>She added: “In Asia-Pa­cific, women spend four to 11 times more time on house­work than men do daily. Ac­cord­ing to the UN Women Asia and the Pa­cific, such work could count for at least US$10.8 tril­lion a year of the global econ­omy. How­ever, the ef­fort spent on this work is of­ten un­recog­nised and un­der­val­ued.”</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah, in her speech at a ple­nary ses­sion ti­tled “Govern­ing the she-cov­ery: De­sign­ing a bet­ter post-pandemic econ­omy”, high­lighted three ar­eas Sin­ga­pore is fo­cus­ing on for its eco­nomic re­cov­ery, and the crit­i­cal role women can play in the process.</p>
    <p>First, the coun­try plans to ac­cel­er­ate its eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion and step up the use of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, au­to­ma­tion and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence. “In or­der to reap the full re­wards of tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vance­ment, we must con­tinue to strengthen women’s par­tic­i­pa­tion in lead­er­ship, and in the im­ple­men­ta­tion of such strate­gies,” she said.</p>
    <p>She added that so­ci­ety has to move away from the tra­di­tional mind­set that fe­males do not pre­fer sci­ence, tech­nol­ogy, en­gi­neer­ing and math­e­mat­ics sub­jects in schools and do not per­form well in re­lated jobs. “We should en­sure that women can ben­e­fit from these same op­por­tu­ni­ties and tech­no­log­i­cal tools,” she said.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, Sin­ga­pore aims to help those in ail­ing in­dus­tries tran­si­tion to other in­dus­tries by up­grad­ing and acquiring new skills.</p>
    <p>“By en­cour­ag­ing our workers to reskill and up­skill, our com­pa­nies can con­tinue to stay rel­e­vant and com­pet­i­tive. And in so do­ing, it also of­fers us an op­por­tu­nity to level the play­ing field be­tween men and women in the work­place,” said Madam Hal­imah.</p>
    <p>Third, Sin­ga­pore has to strengthen its part­ner­ships and di­ver­sity, such as by hav­ing more co­op­er­a­tion be­tween the pri­vate and pub­lic sec­tors and across dif­fer­ent tal­ent pools.</p>
    <p>“We must con­tinue to em­brace di­ver­sity in women’s lead­er­ship and high­light women’s voices and per­spec­tives,” she said. “The re­cently launched Con­ver­sa­tions on Sin­ga­pore Women’s Devel­op­ment is an im­por­tant plat­form to spear­head an in­clu­sive ap­proach to­wards co-cre­at­ing and co-im­ple­ment­ing so­lu­tions on is­sues af­fect­ing women in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>The con­ver­sa­tions, an­nounced in Septem­ber, are gath­er­ing feed­back on is­sues that af­fect women at home, in school, the work­place and in the com­mu­nity. The ideas and sug­ges­tions will form the ba­sis of a White Pa­per to be de­liv­ered in the first half of next year.</p>
    <p>The two-day Women’s Fo­rum Global Meet­ing 2020, which ended yesterday, con­sisted of ple­nary ses­sions, di­a­logues and round­table meet­ings.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants dis­cussed how fe­male lead­ers can play an es­sen­tial role in social and eco­nomic re­cov­ery, while em­pow­er­ing and fos­ter­ing long-term re­silience among the vul­ner­a­ble groups of peo­ple and the so­ci­ety at large.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic hosted Women’s Fo­rum Sin­ga­pore in 2018 and Women’s Fo­rum Asia last year.</p>
