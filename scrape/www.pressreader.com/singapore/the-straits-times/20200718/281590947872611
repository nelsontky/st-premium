    <p>Re­silient de­mand for elec­tron­ics and a low base last year helped de­liver a sur­prise lift to Sin­ga­pore’s non-oil do­mes­tic ex­ports (Nodx), which jumped 16.1 per cent in June from the same month last year, when a de­cline of 17 per cent was recorded.</p>
    <p>Re­silient de­mand for elec­tron­ics and a low base last year helped de­liver a sur­prise lift to non-oil do­mes­tic ex­ports (Nodx) and put them back on track to defy the gen­eral eco­nomic down­turn.</p>
    <p>Nodx jumped 16.1 per cent in June from the same month last year, when a de­cline of 17 per cent was recorded. That low base was in part re­spon­si­ble for the ro­bust fig­ures re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The per­for­mance beat the con­sen­sus fore­cast for an 8 per cent gain from an­a­lysts polled by Bloomberg and a 6.2 per cent in­crease in a Reuters poll.</p>
    <p>Nodx rose 0.5 per cent last month on a sea­son­ally ad­justed ba­sis af­ter a 4.6 per cent de­cline in May, En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) noted.</p>
    <p>That re­vised 4.6 per cent yearon-year fall in May, which was the first drop in four months, was one that con­founded ex­perts who had tipped a 1 per cent in­crease. It was also a stark re­ver­sal from the 9.7 per cent in­crease in April.</p>
    <p>Ship­ments had risen in Fe­bru­ary and March as well, de­spite the plunge in global de­mand for goods be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ms Se­lena Ling, head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy at OCBC Bank, said first-half Nodx growth is off to a pos­i­tive start with 6 per cent yearon-year in­crease, not­with­stand­ing the im­pact of the pan­demic and Sin­ga­pore’s cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>“The June Nodx data sug­gests that the worst may be over, but do not ex­pect the dou­ble-digit Nodx growth mo­men­tum to be sus­tained into the sec­ond half,” she added.</p>
    <p>“The road ahead is yet to be com­pletely smooth sail­ing, as ex­ter­nal risks re­main, namely with the sec­ond Covid-19 waves of in­fec­tions seen to be slow­ing down the pace of re-open­ings in Hong Kong and some US states, for ex­am­ple.”</p>
    <p>She noted that there is also a “need for con­tin­ued gen­er­ous life sup­port from ma­jor cen­tral banks and pol­i­cy­mak­ers to keep busi­ness and con­sumer con­fi­dence on a more sta­ble foot­ing”.</p>
    <p>Mr Prakash Sak­pal, se­nior econ­o­mist at ING Bank in Sin­ga­pore, called last month’s fig­ures “a sub­stan­tial up­side sur­prise”.</p>
    <p>But he added that hopes of an eco­nomic re­bound should be tamed af­ter the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore on Thurs­day warned of a slow and un­even re­cov­ery ahead.</p>
    <p>Ms Ling said that bar­ring a re­turn to lock­downs around the globe, which ap­pears less likely, full-year 2020 Nodx growth is likely to be pos­i­tive, out­per­form­ing the ESG fore­cast of mi­nus 1 to mi­nus 4 per cent year on year.</p>
    <p>United Overseas Bank econ­o­mist Barn­abas Gan up­graded his 2020 Nodx fore­cast from mi­nus 1 per cent to 4 per cent.</p>
    <p>“The up­grade is in view of the rel­a­tively strong per­for­mance in Nodx in the first half as well as on ex­pec­ta­tions for Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic fun­da­men­tals to im­prove into the sec­ond half,” he said.</p>
    <p>Elec­tron­ics Nodx ex­panded by 22.2 per cent last month fol­low­ing the 12.4 per cent in­crease in May.</p>
    <p>The gain was led by ship­ments of disk me­dia prod­ucts, which shot up by 59.8 per cent, fol­lowed by a 37.8 per cent lift in telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions equip­ment and the 29.1 per cent in­crease for in­te­grated cir­cuits.</p>
    <p>MayBank Kim Eng econ­o­mist Chua Hak Bin said elec­tron­ics is ben­e­fit­ing from ris­ing de­mand in data cen­tres and cloud ser­vices while the pan­demic is driv­ing com­pa­nies to adopt new tech­nolo­gies so em­ploy­ees can work from home.</p>
    <p>Dr Chua ex­pects the low base ef­fects from the elec­tron­ics down­turn last year will keep ship­ments pos­i­tive in this half: “We think Nodx will rise by around 3 to 5 per cent in 2020, re­vers­ing the 9.2 per cent de­cline in 2019.”</p>
    <p>Non-elec­tronic Nodx grew by 14.5 per cent year on year last month, af­ter May’s 9 per cent drop.</p>
    <p>Ex­ports of non-mon­e­tary gold swelled by 238 per cent, spe­cialised ma­chin­ery rose 45.9 per cent and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals clocked a 30.8 per cent gain.</p>
    <p>Ship­ments of phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals, which are typ­i­cally volatile, dropped by 31.2 per cent in May.</p>
    <p>ESG said non-mon­e­tary gold ex­ports have been helped by the in­crease in de­mand for phys­i­cal gold as a safe-haven as­set amid global eco­nomic un­cer­tainty and the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ex­ports to Sin­ga­pore’s top mar­kets as a whole grew last month, with the largest con­tri­bu­tions com­ing from ship­ments to Ja­pan (up 94.7 per cent), led by phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals, syn­thetic rub­ber and waste, and per­sonal com­put­ers.</p>
    <p>Ex­ports to South Korea rose 85.6 per cent, mainly of spe­cialised ma­chin­ery, mea­sur­ing in­stru­ments and in­te­grated cir­cuits.</p>
    <p>But ex­ports to Hong Kong, In­done­sia and Thai­land de­clined.</p>
    <p>To­tal trade fell over the year last month, with both ex­ports and im­ports de­creas­ing. On a year-onyear ba­sis, to­tal trade de­clined by 6.6 per cent, eas­ing from the 25 per cent con­trac­tion in May.</p>
