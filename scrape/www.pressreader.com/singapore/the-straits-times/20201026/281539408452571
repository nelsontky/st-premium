    <p>With the Covid-19 pan­demic, vir­tual lo­cal tours and ex­pe­ri­ences are at­tract­ing not only Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents but also for­eign­ers cu­ri­ous to learn about the sights and sounds here. While the vir­tual tour ex­pe­ri­ence re­mains novel to many, the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board is look­ing to pro­mote more of such ac­tiv­i­ties abroad and en­cour­ag­ing providers to take their of­fer­ings on­line.</p>
    <p>With the Covid-19 pan­demic, vir­tual lo­cal tours and ex­pe­ri­ences are at­tract­ing not only Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents but also for­eign­ers cu­ri­ous to learn about the sights and sounds here.</p>
    <p>While the vir­tual tour ex­pe­ri­ence re­mains novel to many, in­clud­ing tour guides here, the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) is look­ing to pro­mote more of such ac­tiv­i­ties abroad and en­cour­ag­ing providers to take their of­fer­ings on­line.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, STB and Airbnb signed a two-year me­moran­dum of un­der­stand­ing to pro­mote the lo­cal tours and ex­pe­ri­ences on Airbnb’s plat­form.</p>
    <p>The tours al­ready on on­line plat­forms, such as TourHQ and Airbnb’s On­line Ex­pe­ri­ences, in­clude live-streamed walk­a­bouts or cook­ing demon­stra­tions, while oth­ers con­sist of pre-recorded seg­ments, with hosts in their own homes or of­fices while en­gag­ing with par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>Ms P.S. Yeo is one of sev­eral here who have taken their tours and ex­pe­ri­ences on­line, in a bid to con­tinue host­ing trav­ellers while glo­be­trot­ting re­mains a chal­lenge due to Covid-19 bor­der re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms Yeo, who owns and op­er­ates Ev­ery­day Tour Com­pany, started the Ex­plore Crazy and Rich Sin­ga­pore on­line tour in July.</p>
    <p>She said the ma­jor­ity of her par­tic­i­pants are from abroad.</p>
    <p>Her tour, cen­tred on the 2018 hit movie Crazy Rich Asians which fea­tures Sin­ga­pore promi­nently, aims to com­pare the lived ex­pe­ri­ences of Sin­ga­pore­ans with those por­trayed in the film, and has drawn au­di­ences from around the world.</p>
    <p>“The movie was su­per pop­u­lar in the United States, so many of the tour par­tic­i­pants come from there, but I’ve also re­ceived sign-ups from Hong Kong, Tai­wan, Ja­pan and China,” said Ms Yeo.</p>
    <p>She hosts between 20 and 60 par­tic­i­pants a week, depend­ing on her sched­ule and whether she re­ceives group book­ings.</p>
    <p>Like Ms Yeo, other tour op­er­a­tors and hosts are tai­lor­ing their prod­ucts to suit over­seas au­di­ences.</p>
    <p>Mr Dhruv Shanker, an ex­pa­tri­ate from In­dia, said his vir­tual cook­ing classes have been pop­u­lar enough among for­eign­ers for him to run them daily at 6am to cater to par­tic­i­pants from the western hemi­sphere, be­fore he be­gins work later as a mar­ket­ing con­sul­tant.</p>
    <p>Mr Shanker, who has lived here for al­most seven years, said while his classes fo­cus on In­dian food, he shares a list of must-eat hawker food and Sin­ga­pore del­i­ca­cies that par­tic­i­pants should try out here.</p>
    <p>“When we’re cook­ing, we don’t just talk about food – many are cu­ri­ous about life in Sin­ga­pore. They ask me about the ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem, law and or­der...” he said.</p>
    <p>The for­mer chef has about 50 stu­dents a week on av­er­age, with about 90 per cent tun­ing in to the classes from abroad.</p>
    <p>When he ran phys­i­cal classes in his apart­ment mostly on week­end af­ter­noons be­fore the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, about half the par­tic­i­pants were tourists from over­seas.</p>
    <p>For tour op­er­a­tor Mon­ster Day Tours, its fort­nightly vir­tual tours of one-north – which it dubs the “Sil­i­con Val­ley of Sin­ga­pore” – are</p>
    <p>mostly at­tended by Sin­ga­pore­ans but there are for­eign­ers too.</p>
    <p>Its founder Suen Tat Yam said about 80 per cent of the par­tic­i­pants are Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents, while the re­main­ing 20 per cent are mostly from other parts of Asia.</p>
    <p>The com­pany in­tends to add vir­tual tour lo­ca­tions and make such events a per­ma­nent fix­ture in its of­fer­ings. “There are some who do not have the priv­i­lege to travel but still want to ex­plore new places. We want to make tours ac­ces­si­ble to them too,” said Mr Suen.</p>
    <p>Mrs Van­dana Om Ku­mar, founder of TourHQ, a plat­form that con­nects guides and trav­ellers around the world, said vir­tual tours might be here to stay.</p>
    <p>“It is bud­get-friendly, and makes lo­ca­tions abroad a lot more ac­ces­si­ble,” she noted, adding that vir­tual tours will re­main pop­u­lar among se­nior cit­i­zens who may face mo­bil­ity chal­lenges when trav­el­ling.</p>
    <p>But it re­mains to be seen whether vir­tual tours will be a game changer fi­nan­cially, said Mr Ng Boon Gee, se­nior di­rec­tor of business de­vel­op­ment at Gar­dens by the Bay, which of­fered vir­tual con­tent on its web­site dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod. It now hosts live vir­tual tours, work­shops and we­bi­nars.</p>
    <p>Still, he noted that “vir­tual tours have helped us to ex­tend our out­reach to new au­di­ences who may</p>
    <p>BRANCH­ING OUT</p>
    <p>Vir­tual tours have helped us to ex­tend our out­reach to new au­di­ences who may oth­er­wise not have thought of vis­it­ing the gar­dens or are un­able to do so be­cause of travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>MR NG BOON GEE, se­nior di­rec­tor of business de­vel­op­ment at Gar­dens by the Bay, which hosts tours and we­bi­nars.</p>
    <p>oth­er­wise not have thought of vis­it­ing the gar­dens or are un­able to do so be­cause of travel re­stric­tions”.</p>
    <p>Guides and tour op­er­a­tors said vir­tual tours will not can­ni­balise fu­ture phys­i­cal vis­its to the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Ms Jean Wang, chair­man of the So­ci­ety of Tourist Guides Sin­ga­pore, said “vir­tual tours can whet (for­eign­ers’) ap­petite but... peo­ple will still want to taste and smell – you can­not repli­cate that on­line”.</p>
