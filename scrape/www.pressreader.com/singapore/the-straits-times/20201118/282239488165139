    <p>NEW YORK • Sea boosted its fore­casts for its two key busi­nesses as it re­ported a surge in rev­enue, a sign that the Sin­ga­pore-based com­pany is ben­e­fit­ing from strong de­mand for gam­ing and e-com­merce in the coro­n­avirus era.</p>
    <p>The firm’s rev­enue dou­bled to US$1.2 bil­lion (S$1.6 bil­lion), while its net loss dou­bled to US$419.9 mil­lion. It now fore­casts its dig­i­tal en­ter­tain­ment busi­ness will sur­pass rev­enue of US$3.1 bil­lion, com­pared with an ear­lier es­ti­mate of as much as US$2 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Its e-com­merce busi­ness is now ex­pected to ex­ceed US$2.3 bil­lion, up from as much as US$1.8 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Sea has emerged as a stock-mar­ket sen­sa­tion since its ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing in 2017, a wa­ger the money-los­ing com­pany can es­tab­lish it­self as a leader in e-com­merce and gam­ing in South-east Asia. Its shares have surged about 1,500 per cent since the start of last year, push­ing its mar­ket value to US$87 bil­lion. The rally has minted at least three bil­lion­aires at the com­pany.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer For­rest Li’s net worth is es­ti­mated at US$9.8 bil­lion, ac­cord­ing to the Bloomberg Bil­lionar­ies In­dex.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue at the group’s game de­vel­oper Garena in­creased 73 per cent to US$569 mil­lion, re­flect­ing sus­tained pop­u­lar­ity of mo­bile bat­tle royale game Free Fire. Rev­enue from e-com­merce plat­form Shopee and other ser­vices climbed 113 per cent to US$489.5 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Sea’s to­tal sales and mar­ket­ing ex­penses in the third quar­ter in­creased 87 per cent to US$471 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Start­ing with its earn­ings re­lease for the third quar­ter, Sea is dis­con­tin­u­ing re­port­ing ad­justed rev­enues and mak­ing other changes to its ac­count­ing method­ol­ogy in re­sponse to Se­cu­ri­ties & Ex­change Com­mis­sion in­quiries.</p>
    <p>Since its ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing in New York in 2017, Sea had been en­cour­ag­ing in­vestors and an­a­lysts to fo­cus on financial met­rics that are not in com­pli­ance with the gen­er­ally ac­cepted ac­count­ing prin­ci­ples, or GAAP. Chief cor­po­rate of­fi­cer Yan­jun Wang said in Au­gust that for Garena, the com­pany will pro­vide another op­er­at­ing met­ric of “book­ings”, which is GAAP rev­enue plus changes in de­ferred rev­enue.</p>
    <p>Sea’s dig­i­tal pay­ments and financial ser­vices unit, SeaMoney, gained traf­fic in the third quar­ter as peo­ple spent more time and money on­line. Its to­tal pay­ment vol­ume for the quar­ter ex­ceeded US$2.1 bil­lion, from US$1.6 bil­lion dur­ing the June quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Sea’s US de­posi­tary re­ceipts closed down 1.8 per cent at US$178.22 in New York on Mon­day. They have gained 343 per cent so far this year, boosting its mar­ket value to US$87 bil­lion.</p>
