    <p>• Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den has urged Se­nate Repub­li­cans not to vote on any can­di­date nom­i­nated to the US Supreme Court as the Novem­ber elec­tion nears, call­ing Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s plan an “ex­er­cise of raw po­lit­i­cal power”.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond Se­nate Repub­li­can on Sun­day voiced ob­jec­tions to Mr Trump’s plan for a quick vote on a re­place­ment to lib­eral Jus­tice Ruth Bader Gins­burg, who died last Fri­day. Such an ap­point­ment by the</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent, if ap­proved by the Se­nate, would ce­ment a 6-3 con­ser­va­tive ma­jor­ity that could in­flu­ence Amer­i­can law and life for decades.</p>
    <p>“Vot­ers of this coun­try should be heard... they’re the ones who this Con­sti­tu­tion en­vi­sions should de­cide who has the power to make this ap­point­ment,” Mr Bi­den, who leads Mr Trump in na­tional opin­ion polls, said in Philadel­phia.</p>
    <p>“To jam this nom­i­na­tion through the Se­nate is just an ex­er­cise of raw po­lit­i­cal power.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den said that if he wins the</p>
    <p>Nov 3 elec­tion, he should have the chance to nom­i­nate the next Supreme Court jus­tice.</p>
    <p>The for­mer vice-pres­i­dent also re­jected the idea of re­leas­ing the names of po­ten­tial nom­i­nees, say­ing that do­ing so, as Mr Trump did, could im­prop­erly in­flu­ence those can­di­dates’ de­ci­sions in their cur­rent court roles as well as sub­ject them to “un­re­lent­ing po­lit­i­cal at­tacks”.</p>
    <p>And he re­it­er­ated his pledge to nom­i­nate an African-Amer­i­can wo­man to the court, which would be a his­toric first, if he has the op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier on Sun­day, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said she did not sup­port Mr Trump’s plan to move fast on filling the seat, be­com­ing the sec­ond of the 53 Repub­li­cans in the 100-seat cham­ber to ob­ject pub­licly fol­low­ing Jus­tice Gins­burg’s death.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, Repub­li­can Senator Su­san Collins of Maine said the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion win­ner should pick the nom­i­nee.</p>
    <p>Senator La­mar Alexan­der, an­other mod­er­ate Repub­li­can, said in a state­ment he did not ob­ject to a vote, adding: “No one should be sur­prised that a Repub­li­can Se­nate ma­jor­ity would vote on a Repub­li­can pres­i­dent’s Supreme Court nom­i­na­tion, even dur­ing a pres­i­den­tial elec­tion year.”</p>
    <p>A ma­jor­ity of Amer­i­cans – some 62 per cent in­clud­ing many Repub­li­cans – told a Reuters/Ip­sos poll that they thought the win­ner of the Novem­ber elec­tion should get to nom­i­nate a jus­tice to fill the va­cancy.</p>
