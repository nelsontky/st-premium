    <p>PUTRAJAYA • Malaysia’s fed­eral govern­ment has al­lowed Sarawak state to limit move­ment be­tween dif­fer­ent zones from this Satur­day to Aug 14, amid a re­cent rise in new coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter for Se­cu­rity Is­mail Sabri Yaakob said Sarawak will also limit the num­ber of in­com­ing flights from Penin­su­lar Malaysia, Sabah and Labuan dur­ing the two weeks. “The state govern­ment has taken strict and proac­tive mea­sures to pre­vent t he spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“Those who want to travel interzone must get po­lice per­mis­sion be­fore do­ing so, while move­ment within the same zone is al­lowed and no per­mis­sion from the au­thor­i­ties is needed,” he said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Zone 1 cov­ers red and yel­low­coded ar­eas af­fected by coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions such as Kuching, Se­rian and Sa­ma­ra­han, while Zone 2 en­com­passes green ar­eas with low in­ci­dences, in­clud­ing Sri Aman, Be­tong, Sarikei, Kapit, Mukah, Bin­tulu, Miri and Lim­bang.</p>
    <p>State cap­i­tal Kuching was de­clared a red zone af­ter four more cases re­lated to the Kota Sen­tosa Hos­pi­tal clus­ter were de­tected. There are 21 peo­ple who were in­fected in that hos­pi­tal alone.</p>
    <p>The Kota Sen­tosa town­ship was put on lock­down and de­clared an “ac­tive case de­tec­tion area”, af­ter a state dis­as­ter man­age­ment com­mit­tee meet­ing chaired by Sarawak’s Chief Min­is­ter Abang Jo­hari Tun Openg on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The com­mit­tee re­ported 38 lo­cal trans­mis­sions and 14 i mported cases in Kuching within the past 14 days, while Sa­ma­ra­han recorded 11 lo­cal and two im­ported in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The state’s tally of con­firmed coro­n­avirus cases stands at 650.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Datuk Seri Is­mail Sabri has con­firmed that there are no re­stric­tions on in­ter-state travel in the rest of Malaysia for the Eid alAdha cel­e­bra­tion on Friday.</p>
    <p>He noted, how­ever, that stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures to curb the spread of the coro­n­avirus must still be ad­hered to. The mea­sures in­clude lim­it­ing the num­ber of vis­i­tors and fam­ily mem­bers to a max­i­mum of 20 peo­ple per house.</p>
    <p>Malaysia re­ported seven new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of in­fec­tions to 8,904 cases.</p>
    <p>No new fa­tal­i­ties were recorded, keep­ing the death toll at 124.</p>
