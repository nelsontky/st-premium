    <p>LA­HORE • Pak­istan has ar­rested a man ac­cused of be­ing a leader of an Is­lamist militant group blamed by the United States and In­dia for the 2008 Mum­bai at­tacks, a counter-ter­ror­ism of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>The ar­rest is in re­la­tion to ter­ror­ism fi­nanc­ing, the of­fi­cial said, and not a spe­cific militant at­tack.</p>
    <p>“Pro­scribed or­gan­i­sa­tion LeT (Lashkar-e-Taiba) leader Zaki ur Rehman Lakhvi (has been) ar­rested on charges of ter­ror­ism fi­nanc­ing,” a spokesman for the Counter Ter­ror­ism Depart­ment of the Pak­istani prov­ince of Pun­jab said on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The sus­pect is said to have been run­ning a med­i­cal dis­pen­sary to col­lect and dis­burse funds for militant ac­tiv­i­ties, the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>A United Na­tions Se­cu­rity Coun­cil sanc­tions com­mit­tee says Lakhvi is LeT’s chief of op­er­a­tions and ac­cuses him of be­ing in­volved in militant ac­tiv­ity in a num­ber of other re­gions and coun­tries, in­clud­ing Chech­nya, Bos­nia, Iraq and Afghanista­n.</p>
    <p>The In­dian au­thor­i­ties said the lone sur­viv­ing gun­man i n the 2008 Mum­bai siege, in which 166 peo­ple were killed in a four-day as­sault, had told in­ter­roga­tors be­fore his ex­e­cu­tion that the as­sailants were i n touch with Lakhvi.</p>
    <p>In­dia has long called on Pak­istan to bring Lakhvi to trial, but Is­lam­abad says Delhi has not pro­vided con­crete ev­i­dence to try the LeT leader.</p>
    <p>He was first ar­rested in 2008 but was later re­leased on bail.</p>
    <p>Mr Im­ran Gill, Lakhvi’s lawyer, con­firmed the ar­rest and said his case would be heard next week. He did not re­spond to fur­ther ques­tions.</p>
    <p>An­other man who In­dia says was the mas­ter­mind of the Mum­bai siege, Hafiz Saeed, was con­victed by a Pak­istani court on two charges of ter­ror­ism fi­nanc­ing last year. Saeed de­nies in­volve­ment in the Mum­bai at­tacks.</p>
