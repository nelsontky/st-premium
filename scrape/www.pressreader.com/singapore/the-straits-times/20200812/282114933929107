    <p>TOKYO • SoftBank Group bounced back from a record loss to post a first-quar­ter profit as val­u­a­tions for tech­nol­ogy start-ups re­cov­ered from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Net in­come hit 1.26 tril­lion yen (S$16.3 bil­lion) for the three months ended June 30, the Tokyo-based com­pany said in a state­ment yes­ter­day, com­pared with a loss of 1.44 tril­lion yen three months ear­lier.</p>
    <p>The Vi­sion Fund in­come was 129.6 bil­lion yen, fol­low­ing a 1.13 tril­lion yen loss for the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Masayoshi Son has pulled off a re­mark­ably speedy come­back af­ter the worst loss in his com­pany’s 39-year his­tory.</p>
    <p>A global rally i n tech­nol­ogy shares lifted the value of SoftBank’s stakes in pub­licly traded firms such as Uber Tech­nolo­gies and im­proved the prospects for start-ups in its port­fo­lio, from China’s Didi Chux­ing to South Korea’s Coupang.</p>
    <p>Mr Son also sold off as­sets and bought back shares at un­prece­dented rates, push­ing up SoftBank’s own stock price to the high­est in two decades.</p>
    <p>“There is a real case for in­creas­ing val­u­a­tions at the Vi­sion Fund, given how much the over­all tech mar­kets have ral­lied,” Mr Justin Tang, head of Asian re­search at United First Part­ners in Sin­ga­pore, said ahead of the an­nounce­ment. “There are still a lot of caveats.”</p>
    <p>The US$100 bil­lion (S$137 bil­lion) Vi­sion Fund Mr Son set up three years ago to in­vest in tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies has be­come a key driver of SoftBank’s in­come.</p>
    <p>SoftBank marks the val­u­a­tion of its sprawl­ing port­fo­lio up or down based on changes over the pre­vi­ous months, re­port­ing the net re­sult as a profit or loss for the Vi­sion Fund.</p>
    <p>The pre­cise cal­cu­la­tions are not dis­closed, but a rally for a public com­pany would typ­i­cally ben­e­fit the val­u­a­tion of a pri­vate peer.</p>
    <p>Take Uber, for ex­am­ple. A plunge in its shares dur­ing the last fis­cal year cost SoftBank bil­lions, but the stock re­bounded 11 per cent in the June quar­ter.</p>
    <p>That trans­lates into a profit for the Ja­panese com­pany and may mean it can write up val­u­a­tions for the rest of its ride-hail­ing port­fo­lio, which in­cludes Didi, South­east Asia’s Grab and Ola in In­dia.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral SoftBank-backed com­pa­nies have also pulled off suc­cess­ful ini­tial public of­fer­ings, rais­ing the prospects for more in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>On­line home-in­sur­ance provider Lemon­ade more than dou­bled in the days af­ter its ini­tial public of­fer­ing last month, while on­col­ogy drug de­vel­oper Re­lay Ther­a­peu­tics has surged about the same amount since its trad­ing de­but.</p>
    <p>Beike Zhao­fang, a Chi­nese on­line prop­erty bro­ker­age backed by SoftBank, said last week it is seek­ing to raise about US$2 bil­lion in a US IPO. DoorDash, a US food de­liv­ery com­pany backed by SoftBank, has filed pa­per­work for a public stock list­ing. On­line in­sur­ance plat­form Pol­i­cy­bazaar and ecom­merce gi­ant Coupang are pre­par­ing for of­fer­ings next year.</p>
    <p>Mr Son put plans for a sec­ond Vi­sion Fund on hold af­ter mis­steps, in­clud­ing the melt­down at WeWork. Now, the fund’s up­beat re­sults and a re­newed in­vestor ap­petite for risk could re­vive the idea, ac­cord­ing to Mr Atul Goyal, se­nior an­a­lyst at Jef­feries Group.</p>
    <p>“With so much money slosh­ing around in the global fi­nan­cial mar­kets, the idea of suc­ces­sive Vi­sion Funds could be back on the ta­ble,” Mr Goyal said ahead of the re­sults an­nounce­ment.</p>
    <p>“SoftBank suf­fered some rep­u­ta­tion dam­age with the first one, but in five or six months Mr Son could have a few spec­tac­u­lar ex­its he can use to start rais­ing money again.”</p>
