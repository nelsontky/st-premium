    <p>• French Prime Min­is­ter Jean Cas­tex warned that the coun­try was see­ing a “clear wors­en­ing” of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, but said he would aim to avoid a new na­tion­wide lock­down that would fur­ther ham­mer the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Nearly 10,000 new cases were re­ported on Thurs­day, a record since wide-scale test­ing be­gan, but Mr Cas­tex said a re­cent in­crease in Covid-19 hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions was par­tic­u­larly wor­ry­ing.</p>
    <p>“We have to suc­ceed in liv­ing with this virus, with­out re­turn­ing to the idea of a gen­er­alised lock­down,” he said in a tele­vised state­ment from his of­fi­cial res­i­dence in Paris on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“Our strat­egy is not chang­ing. We must fight the virus with­out putting on hold our social, cul­tural and eco­nomic life, the education of our chil­dren and our abil­ity to live nor­mally,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Cas­tex said 42 of France’s 101 de­part­ments are now clas­si­fied as “red zones” where the virus is cir­cu­lat­ing rapidly, up from 28 ear­lier last week.</p>
    <p>“There is no Maginot Line – in­evitably it ends up reach­ing the most vul­ner­a­ble,” he said, re­fer­ring to the sup­pos­edly un­break­able de­fences France built ahead of World War II.</p>
    <p>But he did not an­nounce any ma­jor new re­stric­tions, urg­ing peo­ple in­stead to respect social dis­tanc­ing guide­lines and the use of face masks.</p>
    <p>And the quar­an­tine pe­riod for peo­ple who catch the virus will be short­ened to just seven days from 14, to bet­ter match “the pe­riod when there is a real risk of con­ta­gion”, he said.</p>
    <p>The move is a tacit ac­knowl­edge­ment that en­forc­ing quar­an­tine steps has proved nearly im­pos­si­ble given the num­ber of new cases.</p>
    <p>Mr Cas­tex also said test­ing ca­pac­i­ties would be ramped up in re­sponse to long wait­ing times for ap­point­ments and re­sults.</p>
