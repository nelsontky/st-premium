    <p>• United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump on Satur­day signed into law a bill de­signed to give Olympic ath­letes greater pro­tec­tion and more in­put into de­ci­sion-mak­ing in the wake of the Larry Nas­sar gym­nas­tics sex­ual abuse scan­dal.</p>
    <p>The Em­pow­er­ing Olympic, Par­a­lympic and Am­a­teur Ath­letes Act in­creases fund­ing for the US Cen­tre for SafeS­port and cre­ates more ath­lete rep­re­sen­ta­tion on the United States Olympic and Par­a­lympic Com­mit­tee (USOPC) board and na­tional gov­ern­ing bod­ies (NGB).</p>
    <p>If both fail to fol­low up on re­forms, new mech­a­nisms will be in place to al­low Con­gress to dis­solve the USOPC board and de­cer­tify NGBs.</p>
    <p>USA Gym­nas­tics is still reel­ing from the scan­dal that in­volved for­mer team doc­tor Nas­sar, who was sen­tenced to up to 300 years in pri­son in 2018 af­ter more than 350 women tes­ti­fied against him.</p>
    <p>The bill fol­lowed an 18-month bi­par­ti­san in­ves­ti­ga­tion that found he was able to as­sault hun­dreds of girls and women be­cause of a lack of trans­parency and ac­count­abil­ity among US Olympic of­fi­cials, coaches and train­ers.</p>
    <p>The bill’s au­thors, Repub­li­can se­na­tor Jerry Mo­ran and Demo­crat se­na­tor Richard Blu­men­thal, were pleased to see their “sweep­ing re­form leg­is­la­tion” signed into law and praised ath­letes who had tes­ti­fied be­fore Con­gress.</p>
    <p>“This law would not be pos­si­ble were it not for the ath­letes and coura­geous sur­vivors who trav­elled to Wash­ing­ton, shared their sto­ries and de­manded change so that fu­ture gen­er­a­tions of ath­letes can train, com­pete and suc­ceed with­out fear or abuse,” they said in a joint state­ment.</p>
    <p>“We are grate­ful to our col­leagues, ath­lete ad­vo­cates and the many sur­vivors who helped ad­vo­cate for this law to bring about change in the Olympic move­ment.</p>
    <p>“We will make cer­tain this law is be­ing im­ple­mented to the fullest ex­tent and con­tinue to hold ac­count­able the in­sti­tu­tions that have the re­spon­si­bil­ity to keep our ath­letes safe.”</p>
    <p>The Nas­sar scan­dal trig­gered law­suits and mass res­ig­na­tions at USOPC and USA Gym­nas­tics over the or­gan­i­sa­tional fail­ures to ad­e­quately re­spond to the abuse.</p>
    <p>It has led to the con­gres­sional over­sight, with reg­u­lar re­ports and au­dits to be made avail­able.</p>
    <p>The law will also cre­ate a com­mis­sion to study broader is­sues within the Olympic and Par­a­lympic move­ments.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing rec­om­men­da­tions from an in­de­pen­dent re­port, the USOPC last year be­gan to in­tro­duce the first wave of re­forms, in­clud­ing in­creased ath­lete rep­re­sen­ta­tion.</p>
