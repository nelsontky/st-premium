    <p>In Tai­wanese ro­man­tic com­edy My Miss­ing Valen­tine, which opened in cin­e­mas here yes­ter­day, fe­male lead Patty Lee’s nat­u­ral per­for­mance makes her look com­pletely at ease as a post of­fice worker look­ing for love.</p>
    <p>But Lee, in her first lead role in a fea­ture film, was ac­tu­ally feel­ing so stressed that she had anx­ious dreams.</p>
    <p>“I was un­der a lot of pres­sure ev­ery day. I felt like I wasn’t per­form­ing well and I felt sorry to ev­ery­one... I’ll have dreams where I’m ly­ing in bed and I see the en­tire crew in my room. Ev­ery­one is ready and they are just wait­ing for me,” says the 32-year-old in a tele­phone in­ter­view with lo­cal me­dia.</p>
    <p>And it was a chal­lenge for the ac­tress, bet­ter known as a travel host, to land meatier act­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties in the first place.</p>
    <p>“The tough­est thing was that peo­ple know me only as a host, no one knows I can act too. But there are ben­e­fits too – be­ing a host, you have to treat the cam­era ei­ther as in­vis­i­ble or as a friend so that helped me to be nat­u­ral and com­fort­able on-screen.”</p>
    <p>Her ef­forts paid off. My Miss­ing Valen­tine picked up 11 nom­i­na­tions at the Golden Horse Awards, with nods for Lee and her co-star Liu Kuant­ing (right). Lee is also nom­i­nated for Best Orig­i­nal Film Song as she is the lyri­cist and singer for the movie’s theme song Lost</p>
    <p>And Found. The awards cer­e­mony is on Nov 21.</p>
    <p>Lee says: “I was nom­i­nated for the Golden Bell for three years when I fi­nally won, so I know the feel­ing of los­ing out. If you go in with no ex­pec­ta­tions, then there’s no harm done.” She nabbed best life­style pro­gramme host at the tele­vi­sion-fo­cused Golden Bell Awards last year for her travel div­ing show, Underwater 30 Me­tres. Her co-star Liu, 32, won a Golden Horse for Best Sup­port­ing Ac­tor last year for fam­ily drama A Sun.</p>
    <p>My Miss­ing Valen­tine has been a unique film­ing ex­pe­ri­ence for both stars – they have</p>
    <p>few scenes of in­ter­ac­tion to­gether, though they play the leads.</p>
    <p>Lee says: “It’s re­ally a pity that we don’t have more scenes to­gether. We don’t get the chance to bounce our chem­istry off each other.”</p>
    <p>The first half of the movie is ded­i­cated to Lee’s char­ac­ter, who has quirky scenes, like the one in which she sings with aban­don in her bed­room. She says: “The sing­ing was quite dif­fi­cult. I had to go all out be­cause it had to be like a lit­tle girl’s crazy fan­tasy in her own world.”</p>
    <p>While some scenes were out of Lee’s com­fort zone, her char­ac­ter’s im­pa­tient per­son­al­ity and brave pur­suit of love re­flects her­self too.</p>
    <p>She says with a chuckle: “I’m the kind of per­son who if I like some­one, I’ll find chances to speak to him and see where I can make my move.”</p>
    <p>For Liu, play­ing an awk­ward bus driver, who is al­ways one step slower and l ag­ging be­hind his peers, gave him a new per­spec­tive on life. “I tried to slow down my pace of life for this role and I do feel more peace­ful. I can see, hear and feel more. I think there’s a ten­dency in peo­ple now to blindly speed through life and when you ask them what they’ve done, they can’t re­ally an­swer.”</p>
    <p>Asked if he felt his char­ac­ter, who fol­lows Lee’s fe­male lead se­cretly, could be seen as creepy, he says: “He just wants to pro­tect her when he fol­lows her. I think that’s the chal­leng­ing part of the role – he’s very pure and, some­times, things he does are on the line of pure ver­sus creepy, de­pend­ing on who’s look­ing at them.</p>
    <p>“Things you may find won­der­ful as a child, you might think they are scary and creepy when you’re older be­cause in that process, we’ve lost so much pure, gen­uine hu­mour.”</p>
    <p>Aside from his Golden Horse Award win last year, Liu, who is only four years into his act­ing ca­reer, also picked up best sup­port­ing ac­tor at the Golden Bell Awards for A Boy Named Flora A (2017).</p>
    <p>Be­sides My Miss­ing Valen­tine, his streak with crit­i­cally ac­claimed projects con­tin­ues this year with The Silent For­est, which is nom­i­nated for eight Golden Horse prizes, though Liu is not in­di­vid­u­ally nom­i­nated. He plays a teacher in the movie, which is based on a true story of sex­ual as­sault cases against hear­ingdis­abled stu­dents at a school in Tainan.</p>
    <p>Does he have com­pet­ing loy­al­ties? He says: “Win­ning is a mat­ter of good for­tune, so I just want to wish ev­ery­one the best.”</p>
