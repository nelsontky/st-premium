    <p>Gen­er­ous cash in­cen­tives have led many hawk­ers onto the dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion track. Close to half of all 18,000 hawker stalls in Sin­ga­pore now let cus­tomers pay via ma­jor bank­ing apps and e-wal­lets by scan­ning a na­tional QR code.</p>
    <p>A Hawk­ers Go Dig­i­tal pro­gramme launched in June by the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity (IMDA) and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) has been key.</p>
    <p>Hawk­ers who sign up for the Sin­ga­pore Quick Re­sponse Code (SGQR) – backed by the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore – are re­warded with a bonus of $300 a month over five months if they have at least 20 cash­less trans­ac­tions in each month.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to The Straits Times’ queries, the IMDA and ESG said: “We have made good progress. Dig­i­tal am­bas­sadors have al­ready en­gaged all stall­hold­ers from gov­ern­ment-owned premises to en­cour­age them to adopt SGQR for e-pay­ment.”</p>
    <p>The num­ber of hawk­ers of­fer­ing e-pay­ments has also more than dou­bled since June, as more than 8,400 stall­hold­ers are now on board, said the IMDA and ESG.</p>
    <p>But there are still many who re­sist the cash­less mode.</p>
    <p>ST spoke to 50 hawk­ers at three large hawker cen­tres – Toa Payoh West Mar­ket and Food Cen­tre, Red­hill Mar­ket and Food Cen­tre, and Old Air­port Road Food Cen­tre – to find out what more can be done to get hawk­ers to go dig­i­tal.</p>
    <p>WHY CASH IS STILL KING</p>
    <p>Adop­tion rates for cash­less pay­ment var­ied across the places when ST vis­ited them two weeks ago. At the Old Air­port Road Food Cen­tre, ST ob­served that 80 per cent of hawk­ers had a pay­ment QR code or work­ing Nets ter­mi­nal at their stall coun­ters.</p>
    <p>When ST ap­proached the hawk­ers, most were will­ing to ac­cept cash­less pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Some 70 per cent to 80 per cent of hawk­ers at the Toa Payoh and Red­hill mar­kets did not display any e-pay­ment QR code or ter­mi­nal when ST turned up.</p>
    <p>Among those who re­sisted cash­less means, many cited a lack of tech­no­log­i­cal know-how, the small­ness of the pay­ment screen, the scourge of scams and the lack of de­mand from cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>“Cash is still king among my cus­tomers,” said a 58-year-old curry puff stall­holder at Old Air­port Road, who wanted to be known only as Mr Chang.</p>
    <p>“I don’t see the need to use other sys­tems. For us older hawk­ers, cash is more con­ve­nient – par­tic­u­larly dur­ing the rush hours when jug­gling both cash and an e-pay­ment sys­tem can be very trou­ble­some.”</p>
    <p>Mr Mak Chee Wah, 75, who runs a drinks stall at the Red­hill hawker cen­tre, said a lack of tech­ni­cal know-how was likely the big­gest hur­dle for most older hawk­ers.</p>
    <p>“The pay­ment sys­tems will be a con­ve­nient tool if you have tech know-how. But if you are older and less ed­u­cated, learn­ing how to use an app, or even new ma­chines, might be dif­fi­cult,” he noted.</p>
    <p>“I have man­aged to learn how to use the sys­tem, but some might find that with­out re­peated re­minders and re­in­forced train­ing, the sys­tem might be­come more of a bur­den than a bless­ing in the long term.”</p>
    <p>A mixed rice seller in his 60s at the Toa Payoh food cen­tre, who wanted to be known as Mr Ng, also said that fid­dly sys­tems were hard to use for short-sighted, older hawk­ers like him­self.</p>
    <p>“Though I have been us­ing the sys­tem for over a year, with­out a younger as­sis­tant to help me check and key in trans­ac­tions, it can be dif­fi­cult to man­age, es­pe­cially</p>
    <p>AVOID­ING RUSH-HOUR ‘JAM’</p>
    <p>Cash is still king among my cus­tomers. I don’t see the need to use other sys­tems. For us older hawk­ers, cash is more con­ve­nient – par­tic­u­larly dur­ing the rush hours when jug­gling both cash and an e-pay­ment sys­tem can be very trou­ble­some.</p>
    <p>MR CHANG, who sells curry puffs at Old Air­port Road Food Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>LEARN­ING CURVE TO TACKLE</p>
    <p>I have man­aged to learn how to use the sys­tem, but some might find that with­out re­peated re­minders and re­in­forced train­ing, the sys­tem might be­come more of a bur­den than a bless­ing in the long term.</p>
    <p>MR MAK CHEE WAH, who op­er­ates a drinks stall at the Red­hill hawker cen­tre.</p>
    <p>when things get busy dur­ing lunch hour,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It might waste even more time for me to try to han­dle the app, than just tak­ing cash. Cus­tomers don’t want to be kept wait­ing ei­ther as I slowly key in the amount.”</p>
    <p>As for hawker Don Eng, 26, who runs a Western food stall at Old Air­port Road, cash­less pay­ments have pro­vided con­ve­nience as pay­ment can be col­lected quickly via the app, elim­i­nat­ing the need to la­bo­ri­ously get the ex­act amount in change dur­ing din­ing peak hours.</p>
    <p>He be­lieves that more hawk­ers might ac­cept the sys­tem if there are enough safe­guards to pre­vent ex­ploita­tion.</p>
    <p>“There is a lag time be­tween trans­ac­tions go­ing through and ap­pear­ing on our end. Some peo­ple have found ways to game the sys­tem and it re­sults in money lost for us,” he said.</p>
    <p>“More peo­ple would be on board with the sys­tem if there were fewer of such is­sues.”</p>
    <p>MORE IN­CEN­TIVES AND HELP ON THE WAY</p>
    <p>The IMDA said se­niors and hawk­ers who ex­pe­ri­ence dif­fi­cul­ties with their dig­i­tal de­vices can get help at the new SG Dig­i­tal com­mu­nity hubs.</p>
    <p>Of the 60 hubs, 25 are in li­braries and the rest are in com­mu­nity cen­tres.</p>
    <p>“Dig­i­tal am­bas­sadors at the hubs will be able to pro­vide one-to-one as­sis­tance on dig­i­tal skills and knowl­edge, to en­able se­niors and stall­hold­ers to pick up dig­i­tal skills and progress at their own pace,” an IMDA spokesman said.</p>
    <p>The IMDA is look­ing at launch­ing lucky draws and pro­mo­tions to get more din­ers to go cash­less, which in turn may en­cour­age more hawk­ers to ac­cept e-pay­ment.</p>
    <p>One initiative is the on­go­ing Scan, Pay, Win Lucky Draw, which al­lows users of bank­ing apps like DBS PayLah!, OCBC Pay Any­one and UOB Mighty and e-wal­lets like GrabPay and Sing­tel Dash to win up to $4,888 ev­ery month when they scan to pay for pur­chases at par­tic­i­pat­ing hawker stalls.</p>
    <p>“We (will) con­tinue to ex­plore new ways to... ed­u­cate se­nior hawk­ers to help them ex­pe­ri­ence the ben­e­fits of e-pay­ment,” said the IMDA and ESG.</p>
