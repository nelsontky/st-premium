    <p>Malaysia will be­gin ad­min­is­ter­ing Pfizer’s Covid-19 vac­cine as early as Fe­bru­ary, with Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin among the first to get the shot. The gov­ern­ment will also pro­cure enough vac­cines to cover more than 80 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion. A deal has been signed with As­traZeneca to pro­cure 6.4 mil­lion doses of its vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Malaysia will be­gin ad­min­is­ter­ing Pfizer’s Covid-19 vac­cine as early as Fe­bru­ary, with Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin among the first to get the shot be­fore front lin­ers.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment will also pro­cure enough vac­cines to cover more than 80 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“To con­vince the peo­ple that the vac­cine ob­tained is safe and ef­fec­tive, I will be among the first in­di­vid­u­als to re­ceive the Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion,” Tan Sri Muhyid­din said in a tele­vised speech yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The vac­cines will then be ad­min­is­tered to those work­ing on the front line of the Covid-19 bat­tle be­fore be­ing given to high-risk groups such as the el­derly as well as those with non-com­mu­ni­ca­ble diseases and chronic res­pi­ra­tory diseases, he said.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has also signed an agree­ment with phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany As­traZeneca to pro­cure 6.4 mil­lion doses of its Covid-19 vac­cine for 10 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion, the Prime Min­is­ter added.</p>
    <p>This means Malaysia has now pro­cured vac­cines for 40 per cent of its pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Last month, it inked a deal with Pfizer for 12.8 mil­lion doses of vac­cine for 20 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion, and a pact with Covax to cover an­other 10 per cent.</p>
    <p>Covax is an al­liance of coun­tries pool­ing their re­sources to en­sure the equitable global dis­tri­bu­tion of Covid-19 vac­cines.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment is also in fi­nal ne­go­ti­a­tions with China-based Si­no­vac and CanSino, and Rus­sia’s Ga­ma­leya In­sti­tute to se­cure ad­di­tional vac­cine sup­plies, Mr Muhyid­din said.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, there will be enough vac­cines for more than 80 per cent or 26.5 mil­lion of the pop­u­la­tion at a cost of RM2.05 bil­lion (S$675 mil­lion), he said.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment had orig­i­nally aimed to pro­vide enough vac­cines for 70 per cent of Malaysians, he added.</p>
    <p>Science, Tech­nol­ogy and In­no­va­tion Min­is­ter Khairy Ja­malud­din tweeted yes­ter­day that af­ter sign­ing deals with Covax, Pfizer and As­traZeneca, and fi­nal­is­ing agree­ments with Si­no­vac, CanSino and Ga­ma­leya, Malaysia will have vac­cines for al­most 83 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion at a cost of RM2.05 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The vac­cines will be pro­vided free to Malaysians, ac­cord­ing to a poster which he tweeted.</p>
    <p>Malaysia is cur­rently bat­tling a third wave of the Covid-19 out­break, with 2,062 cases and one fa­tal­ity recorded yes­ter­day.</p>
