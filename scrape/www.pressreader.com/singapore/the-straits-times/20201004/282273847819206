    <p>Draw the cur­tains, and the fu­tur­is­tic fa­cade of Ion Or­chard greets me. To the left is the crys­talline Wisma Atria, the grand dame of Or­chard Road malls. To the right, Whee­lock Place’s dis­tinc­tive cone-shaped atrium re­minds me of Christ­mas trees that will soon be lit up for Yule­tide fes­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Work­ing in the heart of Or­chard Road is di­vine. From a room at Sin­ga­pore Mar­riott Tang Plaza Ho­tel, I can tap away on my lap­top and ever so of­ten glance at the gor­geous view of Sin­ga­pore’s most fa­mous shop­ping street. Although the crowds are smaller ow­ing to the Covid-19 pan­demic, the sight is fa­mil­iar, even sooth­ing, and a wel­come dis­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>The ho­tel, which boasts 403 guest rooms, has a Work In Style, Stay Con­nected pack­age cost­ing from $120 a room a day. From 7am to 7pm, I get to use the room as my of­fice. There is no short­age of elec­tri­cal points for my lap­top, smart­phone and other de­vices, and I can work from a mar­ble side ta­ble.</p>
    <p>The com­pli­men­tary high-speed Wi-Fi is strong and steady enough to write this ar­ti­cle, and the air­con­di­tion­ing hums at a com­fort­able 24 deg C.</p>
    <p>The 46-inch Sam­sung tele­vi­sion has some 60 chan­nels, from ABC Aus­tralia to Vas­an­tham. I set­tle on BBC World News be­cause I am work­ing, after all. Fox Movies would be too dis­tract­ing.</p>
    <p>With plenty of nat­u­ral light, the room feels like a sleek work­ing cabin. Its con­tem­po­rary fur­nish­ings are pleas­ing too, in­clud­ing a king-sized bed with cosy and soft Mar­riott Re­vive bed­ding in case I need to take a rest to bet­ter fo­cus, of course.</p>
    <p>The in-room ket­tle and pack­ets of Lavazza cof­fee and TWG Tea of­fer help­ful perk-me-ups.</p>
    <p>The room’s van­ity counter, hairdryer, iron and iron­ing board also help me look no less than my best dur­ing Zoom calls.</p>
    <p>My only com­plaint is that the 1956 leather Eames desk chairs are very squeaky. Each time I lean back, they let out a shrill protest.</p>
    <p>In my book, the ho­tel gets an A for clean­li­ness. On the ta­ble is a card ex­plain­ing that the room has been dis­in­fected, in­clud­ing bath­room sur­faces, doors, han­dles, tele­phones, chair arm­rests and the tele­vi­sion re­mote con­trol. If in doubt, al­co­hol wet wipes are sup­plied.</p>
    <p>Out­side the room, clean­ers are hard at work ev­ery­where I turn. I feel quite re­as­sured with such rig­or­ous mea­sures.</p>
    <p>With an ap­point­ment, I can use the ho­tel’s swim­ming pool and fit­ness cen­tre. I do not sam­ple the in-room din­ing, but it is great to know that my pack­age al­lows me 30 per cent off the menu, as well as at five restau­rants in the ho­tel. It is a treat to duck into Wan Hao Chi­nese Restau­rant for braised win­ter melon with spinach broth and bean curd stick with hawthorn sauce and mango, a def­i­nite up­grade from my hasty meals at home.</p>
    <p>There is so much to do in the ho­tel, I for­get for a moment that I am in the heart of Or­chard Road. Since I have fin­ished a ton of work in the morn­ing, in­clud­ing writ­ing this re­view, I leap onto the ho­tel bed for a guilt-free siesta in the mid­dle of the work­day.</p>
