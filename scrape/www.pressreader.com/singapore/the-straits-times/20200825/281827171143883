    <p>SYDNEY • The Aus­tralian state of Vic­to­ria re­ported its low­est daily rise in new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions in seven weeks yes­ter­day, fu­elling op­ti­mism that a deadly sec­ond wave there is sub­sid­ing.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria yes­ter­day re­ported 116 cases and 15 deaths from the virus in the past 24 hours, down from a peak of more than 700 cases early this month.</p>
    <p>The state ac­counted for the vast ma­jor­ity of the 121 new cases in Aus­tralia in the past 24 hours, the coun­try’s low­est sin­gle-day rise since July 5.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia saw a surge in in­fec­tions in the past month in Mel­bourne, Vic­to­ria’s cap­i­tal and the coun­try’s sec­ond-largest city, but cases have been trend­ing down­wards in re­cent days, helped by a to­tal lock­down.</p>
    <p>“It’s a light at the end of the tun­nel,” Aus­tralia’s deputy chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer Nick Coatsworth told re­porters in Can­berra. “It’s a sub­stan­tial re­as­sur­ance that the over­all trend is down.”</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has recorded nearly 25,000 Covid-19 in­fec­tions, in­clud­ing 517 deaths, from a pop­u­la­tion of 25 mil­lion. It has avoided the high fa­tal­i­ties ex­pe­ri­enced by many other na­tions due to strict lock­down mea­sures.</p>
    <p>While the Mel­bourne lock­down has cur­tailed the spread of in­fec­tions, it has wreaked havoc on the econ­omy, with Aus­tralia’s ef­fec­tive un­em­ploy­ment rate ex­pected to climb above 13 per cent by the end of next month, ac­cord­ing to govern­ment es­ti­mates.</p>
    <p>Nearly half a mil­lion peo­ple could lose their jobs due to the full lock­down in Mel­bourne, Trea­surer Josh Fry­den­berg said on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The lock­down will also force one of the most iconic fix­tures on the Aus­tralian sport­ing cal­en­dar, the Aus­tralian Foot­ball League (AFL) Grand Fi­nal, to be played out­side of Mel­bourne for the first time in its his­tory.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria state Premier Daniel An­drews said an ex­cep­tion would not be made, even for an event so im­por­tant to Vic­to­ri­ans that a pub­lic hol­i­day is ob­served the day be­fore it.</p>
    <p>“For the sake of one event – as im­por­tant as re­li­gious al­most, as it is – the no­tion that you would take a hol­i­day from the coro­n­avirus for the day so we could have the grand fi­nal for a day and a dose of nor­mal, that doesn’t make any sense,” he told a news con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“That would only spread the virus. It hurts, but not as much as po­ten­tially spread­ing the virus more. That no­tion is not on the ta­ble.”</p>
    <p>The Grand Fi­nal is the cli­max of the AFL sea­son and usu­ally takes place in late Septem­ber or early Oc­to­ber.</p>
