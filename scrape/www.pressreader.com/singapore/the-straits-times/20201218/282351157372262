    <p>World Rugby has con­firmed that the HSBC Sin­ga­pore Rugby Sevens will re­turn next Oc­to­ber, national sports agency Sport Sin­ga­pore an­nounced in a press state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ini­tially planned for April, the event was moved to Oct 29-30 to</p>
    <p>“pro­vide a longer run­way for the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion to sta­bilise and for more spec­ta­tors to be per­mit­ted into the venue”.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore leg will be the penul­ti­mate stop be­fore the se­ries fi­nale in Hong Kong from Nov 5-7. The or­gan­is­ers had ini­tially hoped to kick off the se­ries – which has com­prised of 10 stops since the 2015-16 sea­son – in Hong Kong and Sin­ga­pore in April.</p>
    <p>“A fur­ther up­date on con­tin­gency sched­ul­ing for the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Se­ries 2021 will be pro­vided early in the new year, with a re­turn to a full com­pe­ti­tion sched­ule an­tic­i­pated for the 2022 edi­tion,” said a state­ment on the World Rugby web­site.</p>
    <p>This year’s edi­tion was post­poned from April to Oc­to­ber, be­fore it was can­celled ow­ing to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The event at­tracted 16 in­ter­na­tional teams and 57,000 fans to the Sin­ga­pore Sports Hub last year.</p>
    <p>It is one of sev­eral mar­quee events the Repub­lic hosts an­nu­ally, in­clud­ing foot­ball’s In­ter­na­tional Cham­pi­ons Cup (ICC), the HSBC Women’s World Cham­pi­onship, and the For­mula One Sin­ga­pore Grand Prix. Those events were can­celled this year as well but the golf event looks set to re­turn next year too af­ter its ti­tle spon­sor an­nounced on Mon­day it has re­newed its com­mit­ment to the tour­na­ment on a multi-year deal.</p>
    <p>SportSG chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Lim Teck Yin said the agency will work with World Rugby, the Sin­ga­pore Rugby Union (SRU) and the Sports Hub to “take ev­ery pre­cau­tion to en­sure the safety of fans in line with pre­vail­ing dis­tanc­ing mea­sures”. He added: “This is a pru­dent step for­ward for rugby and we are look­ing for­ward to wel­com­ing fans back to the sport.”</p>
    <p>Rugby fan Ernie Khoo, who has at­tended the past three Sin­ga­pore Sevens, was over­joyed with the news, adding that it was the right de­ci­sion to hold the event later.</p>
    <p>The 50-year-old said: “I would think April is a bit too pre­ma­ture. Oc­to­ber is a long wait but I guess with cur­rent cir­cum­stances, it might not be too safe to hold it in April.”</p>
    <p>It re­mains un­cer­tain if lo­cal and for­eign fans can at­tend. But ex­ist­ing tick­ets re­main valid for next year’s event. Fans may re­quest a re­fund by call­ing 3158-8588 or email­ing en­quiry@tick­et­mas­ter.sg. For more in­for­ma­tion, visit www.sin­ga­pore7s.com.sg.</p>
