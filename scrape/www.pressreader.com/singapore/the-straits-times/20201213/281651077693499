    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The United States Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion au­tho­rised the first Covid-19 vac­cine de­vel­oped by Pfizer and BioNTech, mak­ing it avail­able for emer­gency use to pa­tients aged 16 and older.</p>
    <p>The fol­low­ing is an out­line of vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion plans.</p>
    <p>WHAT HAP­PENS NEXT?</p>
    <p>The fed­eral gov­ern­ment plans to re­lease the na­tion’s first 2.9 mil­lion doses within days of the au­tho­ri­sa­tion to 64 states, US ter­ri­to­ries and ma­jor cities, as well as five fed­eral agen­cies. Although it is co­or­di­nat­ing dis­tri­bu­tion ef­forts, states have the fi­nal de­ci­sion over who gets the first shots. The fed­eral gov­ern­ment is send­ing the first ship­ments to more than 600 lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>WHO IS FIRST IN LINE FOR A SHOT?</p>
    <p>States are pri­ori­tis­ing health­care work­ers and el­derly long-term care res­i­dents for the first vac­ci­na­tions. There are about 21 mil­lion health­care work­ers in the US and three mil­lion nurs­ing home res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Most states an­tic­i­pate they will be able to vac­ci­nate only be­tween 13 per cent and 18 per cent of their health­care work­ers with the first dis­tri­bu­tion, a Reuters anal­y­sis found. The fed­eral gov­ern­ment has said it will con­tinue to send out mil­lions of doses each week but has not re­leased ex­act fig­ures.</p>
    <p>WHO IS NEXT IN LINE?</p>
    <p>States have broad dis­cre­tion over who will get the vac­cine next. So far, a panel ad­vis­ing the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion (CDC) has only is­sued the guid­ance that health­care work­ers and nurs­ing home res­i­dents should be first.</p>
    <p>The CDC has laid out a pos­si­ble frame­work of three dis­tri­bu­tion phases, sug­gest­ing es­sen­tial work­ers and peo­ple aged 65 and older as the next pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>Pfizer has said it would make 50 mil­lion doses this year – enough to in­oc­u­late 25 mil­lion peo­ple – about half of which would go to the US. It has an agree­ment with the US gov­ern­ment to sup­ply a to­tal of 100 mil­lion doses, enough for 50 mil­lion peo­ple to be vac­ci­nated.</p>
