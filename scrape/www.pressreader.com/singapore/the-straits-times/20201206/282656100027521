    <p>Mer­i­toc­racy, Sin­ga­pore’s sacro­sanct na­tional ide­ol­ogy, was meant by its cre­ator as a dystopia.</p>
    <p>When Bri­tish so­ci­ol­o­gist Michael Young coined the term in 1958, he imag­ined a fic­tional so­ci­ety that had over­come class bar­ri­ers, only to be­come ob­sessed with mea­sur­ing merit.</p>
    <p>Far from be­ing fair, he thought this so­ci­ety would cre­ate a new aris­toc­racy of tal­ent, re­sult­ing in so­cial in­equal­ity that would lead even­tu­ally to re­volt.</p>
    <p>If this seems pre­scient, it is be­cause Amer­i­cans are liv­ing Young’s dystopia now, says Har­vard Univer­sity pro­fes­sor Michael San­del.</p>
    <p>But are one’s achieve­ments ever fully his own? Af­ter all, win­ning the lottery of birth plays no small part in peo­ple’s suc­cesses.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, af­flu­ent fam­i­lies can af­ford to give their chil­dren more re­sources and even pull strings to get them ad­mit­ted into sup­pos­edly mer­i­to­cratic elite uni­ver­si­ties, San­del notes.</p>
    <p>He read­ily ad­mits this prob­lem is not new, but ar­gues that an­swer­ing it is nec­es­sary to un­der­stand­ing how mer­i­toc­racy has proved so se­duc­tive an ide­ol­ogy.</p>
    <p>In his sem­i­nal A The­ory Of Jus­tice (1971), the in­flu­en­tial lib­eral philoso­pher John Rawls ar­gued that since peo­ple can­not con­trol the cir­cum­stances of their birth, a just so­ci­ety needs to en­sure fair­ness through equality of op­por­tu­nity. In other words, if there is a prob­lem, it is not with mer­i­toc­racy, but rather with in­suf­fi­cient mer­i­toc­racy.</p>
    <p>Here, San­del asks a more novel ques­tion: Would even the perfect mer­i­toc­racy be just?</p>
    <p>For him, the an­swer is no.</p>
    <p>San­del’s strength is not in punc­til­ious ex­po­si­tion, but in his knack for breath­ing life into phi­los­o­phy by ap­ply­ing it to to­day’s hap­pen­ings.</p>
    <p>The more mer­i­toc­racy be­comes a fact, he warns, the more elites will feel they de­serve their high sta­tion in life and dis­dain those at the bot­tom, who are made to feel they de­serve to be there.</p>
    <p>The most cur­rent – and overused – of these ex­am­ples is, of course, the po­lar­i­sa­tion of the United States.</p>
    <p>It is now a fa­mil­iar lib­eral post-mortem of the 2016 – and, for some, this year’s – elec­tion: Out­go­ing US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump drew on lower-wage, lesse­d­u­cated Amer­i­cans who re­sented be­ing told by lib­eral col­lege-ed­u­cated elites that they de­serve to be where they are.</p>
    <p>Other ex­am­ples will seem more ap­pli­ca­ble closer to home.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, San­del crit­i­cises the idea that only the “best and bright­est” should govern as “a myth born of mer­i­to­cratic hubris” – one that ig­nores the need for prac­ti­cal wis­dom and de­lib­er­a­tion, not just tech­no­cratic ex­per­tise.</p>
    <p>He was re­fer­ring to for­mer US pres­i­dent Barack Obama’s Cab­i­net of Ivy League col­lege alumni, but could eas­ily have been speak­ing of many other coun­tries’ well-cre­den­tialed po­lit­i­cal lead­er­ship, Sin­ga­pore’s in­cluded.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, San­del con­vinc­ingly ar­gues that the dark side of mer­i­to­cratic think­ing is a “rhetoric of re­spon­si­bil­ity”, where politi­cians sug­gest that poor peo­ple who have not worked hard enough do not de­serve help.</p>
    <p>Again, he refers to Repub­li­cans and Democrats, but one might ap­ply the same think­ing to Sin­ga­pore, where “means-test­ing” and self-re­liance are tenets of pol­icy.</p>
    <p>This is not the first time San­del, dubbed the “most rel­e­vant liv­ing philoso­pher” by Newsweek mag­a­zine, has man­aged to fill old bot­tles with new wine, as the mil­lions who watched his Har­vard on­line course Jus­tice will at­test.</p>
    <p>Though US-cen­tric, the ex­am­ples in his book are re­lat­able enough for Sin­ga­porean read­ers.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the most im­por­tant of his warn­ings is that mer­i­toc­racy erodes the com­mon good.</p>
    <p>It erodes the dig­nity of low-wage work, which it took a pan­demic for many to deem “es­sen­tial”. It erodes so­cial bonds by pit­ting in­di­vid­u­als against one an­other.</p>
    <p>To counter this, San­del calls for a re­con­sid­er­a­tion of the kinds of work so­ci­ety es­teems and of what ci­ti­zens owe one an­other.</p>
    <p>For this to hap­pen, be­yond equality of op­por­tu­nity, there needs to be equality of con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>These are lessons worth pon­der­ing for Sin­ga­pore, which may be es­pe­cially close to reach­ing Young’s bleak vi­sion of a perfect mer­i­toc­racy.</p>
    <p>If you like this, read: This Is What In­equal­ity Looks Like by Teo You Yenn (Ethos Books, 2018, $27.82, avail­able at bit.ly/WInequal­i­tyLL_Teo), which ex­plores one of the dark sides of mer­i­toc­racy in Sin­ga­pore through a deep ethnog­ra­phy of low-in­come fam­i­lies liv­ing in ren­tal flats.</p>
    <p>These ar­ti­cles in­clude af­fil­i­ate links. When you buy through them, we may earn a small com­mis­sion.</p>
