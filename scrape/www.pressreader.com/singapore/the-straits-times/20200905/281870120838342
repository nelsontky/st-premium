    <p>WASH­ING­TON Ma­jor air­lines want the US and Bri­tish gov­ern­ments to launch a pas­sen­ger test­ing trial for the coro­n­avirus for flights be­tween Lon­don and New York to pave the way for a re­sump­tion of more in­ter­na­tional travel.</p>
    <p>In a let­ter to gov­ern­ment trans­porta­tion of­fi­cials seen by Reuters, the chief ex­ec­u­tives of Air­lines for Amer­ica, Air­lines UK, Heathrow Air­port and Vir­gin At­lantic Air­ways said both gov­ern­ments should “es­tab­lish pas­sen­ger test­ing solutions in air travel. “We be­lieve that in the im­me­di­ate ab­sence of a vac­cine, test­ing of pas­sen­gers in avi­a­tion pro­vides the best and most ef­fec­tive front­line de­fence.”</p>
    <p>They urged the gov­ern­ments to es­tab­lish a test­ing trial be­tween New York and Lon­don by month’s end “to gather real world ev­i­dence and data”.</p>
    <p>Ms Sharon Pinker­ton, se­nior vice-pres­i­dent at Air­lines for Amer­ica, which rep­re­sents Amer­i­can Air­lines Co, Delta Air Lines, United Air</p>
    <p>lines and oth­ers, told re­porters on Thurs­day the in­dus­try wanted a pilot pro­gramme to help boost in­ter­na­tional travel.</p>
    <p>US in­ter­na­tional travel has fallen by 87 per cent dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, which has bat­tered the air­line in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“One of the key steps to re­cov­ery is set­ting up an in­ter­na­tional pilot pro­gramme be­tween the US and either Europe, Canada, some­where in the Pa­cific,” she said, say­ing that could help elim­i­nate some of the in­ter­na­tional quar­an­tines now in place.</p>
    <p>The US Trans­porta­tion Depart­ment said it “stands ready to sup­port the safe re­sump­tion of in­ter­na­tional flights be­tween the US and Europe. Con­ver­sa­tions are on­go­ing be­tween the fed­eral gov­ern­ment, in­ter­na­tional part­ners, and in­dus­try stake­hold­ers on these mat­ters.”</p>
    <p>A United King­dom gov­ern­ment rep­re­sen­ta­tive de­clined to com­ment on the pro­posal. In March, US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump barred most non-US cit­i­zens who had been in the UK re­cently from en­ter­ing the United States – re­stric­tions also im­posed on trav­ellers in the Euro­pean Union and China. Amer­i­cans can travel to the UK, but have been re­quired since spring to spend two weeks in quar­an­tine on ar­rival.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, G-20 for­eign min­is­ters on Thurs­day sought in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion over eas­ing travel re­stric­tions and re­open­ing bor­ders, as months of coro­n­avirus shut­downs ex­ert a drag on the global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Na­tional shut­downs of vary­ing in­ten­sity and du­ra­tion have taken a toll on liveli­hoods around the globe as busi­nesses are shut­tered, rev­enues plunge and mil­lions are forced out of work. “Dur­ing the meet­ing, for­eign min­is­ters ac­knowl­edged the im­por­tance of open­ing bor­ders, unit­ing fam­i­lies, and pro­mot­ing mea­sures to al­low the econ­omy to thrive,” the G-20 group said in a joint state­ment.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ters also dis­cussed the “im­por­tance of co­or­di­nat­ing pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures” across bor­ders to pro­tect lives and liveli­hoods, added the state­ment fol­low­ing a vir­tual meet­ing hosted by Saudi Ara­bia.</p>
    <p>The oil-rich king­dom, which has sus­pended in­ter­na­tional travel for months in a bid to limit the spread of the virus, holds the G-20 pres­i­dency this year. “Re­open­ing bor­ders, in ac­cor­dance with all the pro­tec­tive mea­sures... will help our economies to thrive, peo­ple to pros­per, and will of course bring hope for hu­man­ity,” Saudi For­eign Min­is­ter Prince Faisal Farhan was quoted as say­ing in the state­ment.</p>
    <p>United Na­tions Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral An­to­nio Guter­res said con­cerns were grow­ing that the cur­rent travel re­stric­tions “could out­last the im­me­di­ate cri­sis”.</p>
    <p>He urged the G-20 min­is­ters to agree on “com­mon cri­te­ria” to lift the re­stric­tions based on a sci­en­tific ap­proach.</p>
    <p>BOOST­ING TRAVEL One of the key steps to re­cov­ery is set­ting up an in­ter­na­tional pilot pro­gramme be­tween the US and either Europe, Canada, some­where in the ’’ Pa­cific. MS SHARON PINKER­TON, se­nior vice-pres­i­dent at Air­lines for Amer­ica, which rep­re­sents Amer­i­can Air­lines Co, Delta Air Lines, United Air­lines and oth­ers. She said the in­dus­try wanted a pilot pro­gramme to help boost in­ter­na­tional travel.</p>
