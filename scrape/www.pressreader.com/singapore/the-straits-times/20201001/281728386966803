    <p>WASH­ING­TON • United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and Demo­cratic chal­lenger Joe Bi­den were set to cam­paign in three US states that will play a key role in the Novem­ber elec­tion yes­ter­day, the morn­ing af­ter a chaotic de­bate marked by in­ter­rup­tions and re­crim­i­na­tions.</p>
    <p>The first of three tele­vised matchups rep­re­sented one of Mr Trump’s few re­main­ing chances to change the tra­jec­tory of a race that most na­tional opinion polls show him los­ing, as the ma­jor­ity of Amer­i­cans dis­ap­prove of his han­dling of both the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and protests over racial in­jus­tice.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump and Mr Bi­den nod­ded po­litely to each other at the start. But from the open­ing ques­tion by moder­a­tor Chris Wal­lace of Fox News, the ten­sion was un­mis­tak­able and the clash­ing quickly got out of hand. What re­sulted is likely to go down as one of the low points in US pres­i­den­tial de­bate his­tory.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s fre­quent in­ter­rup­tions and per­sonal barbs dur­ing the roughly 90-minute show­down were the per­son­i­fi­ca­tion of his re-elec­tion strat­egy, which has focused largely on ex­cit­ing a core group of die-hard sup­port­ers who revel in his will­ing­ness to in­sult and shock while giv­ing no ground.</p>
    <p>But Mr Bi­den’s weighted as­saults made clear that the chal­lenger was not go­ing to wilt as the two ri­vals en­gaged in a ver­bal slugfest the likes of which US vot­ers have not seen on the mod­ern de­bate stage.</p>
    <p>NBC Nightly News an­chor Lester Holt said the de­bate was “a low point in po­lit­i­cal dis­course”.</p>
    <p>Dr Richard Haass, pres­i­dent of US think-tank Coun­cil on For­eign Re­la­tions, said: “That was the most dis­cour­ag­ing, most de­press­ing, most trou­bling 90 min­utes I can re­call. If you are not wor­ried about the fu­ture of this coun­try, you were not watch­ing.”</p>
    <p>CNN’s Jake Tap­per said of the de­bate: “That was a hot mess, in</p>
    <p>GET­TING PER­SONAL</p>
    <p>Don’t ever use the word smart with me. Be­cause you know what, there’s noth­ing smart about you, Joe.</p>
    <p>PRES­I­DENT DON­ALD TRUMP, mock­ing Mr Joe Bi­den’s aca­demic per­for­mance at the Univer­sity of Delaware.</p>
    <p>side a dump­ster fire, in­side a train wreck... The Amer­i­can peo­ple lost.”</p>
    <p>The in­sults fea­tured heav­ily dur­ing a chaotic en­counter in which Mr Trump of­ten talked over Mr Bi­den and Mr Wal­lace.</p>
    <p>The tone of the de­bate was set early, as a ques­tion about the Supreme Court va­cancy cre­ated by the death of Jus­tice Ruth Bader Gins­burg set off a back-and-forth be­tween the can­di­dates that quickly turned per­sonal.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, who has re­fused to an­swer the ques­tion of whether he sup­ports ex­pand­ing the Supreme Court, was con­sis­tently cut off by Mr Trump as he tried to an­swer a ques­tion. He ini­tially ig­nored Mr Trump’s in­ter­rup­tions, but af­ter the Pres­i­dent said, “He’s not go­ing to an­swer the ques­tion”, Mr Bi­den hit back: “I’m not go­ing to an­swer the ques­tion.”</p>
    <p>As Mr Bi­den tried to restart his ex­pla­na­tion, the Pres­i­dent cut him off again, and the Demo­cratic nom­i­nee shot back: “Will you shut up, man? This is so un-pres­i­den­tial.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing an­other ex­change on the topic of Mr Trump’s tax his­tory, the US Pres­i­dent cut Mr Bi­den off as the for­mer vice-pres­i­dent ar­gued that the cur­rent ad­min­is­tra­tion’s tax cuts had been ill ad­vised, say­ing that Mr Bi­den’s long ca­reer in pub</p>
    <p>FRE­QUENTLY IN­TER­RUPTED</p>
    <p>It’s hard to get any word in with this clown, ex­cuse me, this per­son.</p>
    <p>MR JOE BI­DEN, who kept get­ting cut off by Mr Trump while try­ing to present his ar­gu­ments.</p>
    <p>lic ser­vice should have pro­duced the im­prove­ments he sought.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den re­sponded with a blunt re­tort: “You’re the worst pres­i­dent Amer­ica has ever had.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump re­torted that “in 47 months, I’ve done more than you have in 47 years”, re­fer­ring to his ri­val’s ca­reer in Wash­ing­ton. Mr Bi­den even called the Pres­i­dent a “clown” – twice.</p>
    <p>At one point, he ap­par­ently thought bet­ter of it. “It’s hard to get any word in with this clown, ex­cuse me, this per­son,” he said, dur­ing their ex­change about taxes.</p>
    <p>On Twit­ter and at cam­paign ral­lies, Mr Trump, 74, has called Mr Bi­den “Sleepy Joe”, an ap­par­ent dig at the 77-year-old Demo­crat’s vi­tal­ity. He did not use the nick­name on Tues­day. But in their first de­bate, Mr Trump had plenty of dis­parag­ing things to say about his ri­val, whom he trails in na­tional opinion polls ahead of the Nov 3 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent brought up Mr Bi­den’s son’s strug­gles with drugs and mocked his op­po­nent’s aca­demic per­for­mance at the Univer­sity of Delaware where, ac­cord­ing to the Wash­ing­ton Post, Mr Bi­den grad­u­ated 506th in a class of 688.</p>
    <p>“He was the low­est or al­most the low­est in your class. Don’t ever use the word smart with me,” Mr Trump said. “Be­cause you know what, there’s noth­ing smart about you, Joe.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump also sug­gested that Mr Bi­den could not drum up enough in­ter­est to hold large in-per­son ral­lies, when Mr Bi­den crit­i­cised him for flout­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules at events.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a seg­ment on race re­la­tions, Mr Wal­lace asked Mr Trump whether he would de­nounce white su­prem­a­cists. Mr Trump an­swered only with an am­biva­lent com­ment on the “Proud Boys” – a white su­prem­a­cist group which held a gath­er­ing in Port­land last week. “Proud Boys stand by, stand back, but some­body has to do some­thing about (the far left anti-fas­cist net­work) An­tifa,” he said.</p>
    <p>He also de­clined to say he would ac­cept the elec­tion re­sults, re­peat­ing his un­founded as­ser­tion that wide­spread vot­ing by mail would lead to mas­sive fraud.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump was set to spend yes­ter­day in Min­nesota with a fund-raiser in the af­ter­noon be­fore a rally in Duluth. Mr Bi­den and his wife, Jill, were to em­bark on a train tour through six cities in east­ern Ohio and western Penn­syl­va­nia, in­clud­ing coun­ties that Mr Trump won four years ago on the strength of work­ing-class white vot­ers.</p>
    <p>Un­til Tues­day, Mr Bi­den still led Mr Trump by some seven points in na­tion­wide polls. More than a mil­lion Amer­i­cans are al­ready cast­ing early bal­lots and time is run­ning out to change minds or in­flu­ence un­de­cided vot­ers.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, elec­tion bet­ting odds on Bet­fair Ex­change, the op­er­a­tor of the world’s largest on­line bet­ting bourse, showed Mr Bi­den’s prob­a­bil­ity of win­ning at 60 per cent, up from 56 per cent be­fore the de­bate. Mr Trump has a 40 per cent prob­a­bil­ity of vic­tory.</p>
    <p>NEW YORK • Nearly 100,000 New York City vot­ers re­ceived de­fec­tive ab­sen­tee bal­lots, elec­tion of­fi­cials ac­knowl­edged on Tues­day, a far­reach­ing er­ror that raised doubts about the city’s abil­ity to han­dle a pan­demic-era pres­i­den­tial elec­tion with mil­lions of mail-in bal­lots ex­pected.</p>
    <p>The prob­lems were mostly con­fined to Brook­lyn, where vot­ers ex­pressed ou­trage and con­fu­sion af­ter seeing that their bal­lots had mis­matched names and ad­dresses on the outer and re­turn en­velopes.</p>
    <p>Mayor Bill de Bla­sio called the sit­u­a­tion “ap­palling”. “I don’t know how many times we’re go­ing to see the same thing hap­pen at the Board of Elec­tions and be sur­prised,” he said.</p>
    <p>The faulty bal­lots come as Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has made re­peated base­less chal­lenges to the ac­cu­racy and in­tegrity of mail-in vot­ing. On Mon­day even­ing, Mr Trump had shared at least four news ar­ti­cles about the New York is­sues on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>The prob­lems in New York are yet an­other blem­ish for the New York City Board of Elec­tions, which is run by a board of Democrats and Repub­li­cans, and has a long his­tory of mis­man­ag­ing elec­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Michael Ryan, the board’s ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor, blamed the board’s ven­dor, Phoenix Graph­ics, a com­mercial print­ing com­pany based in Rochester, New York, which was hired to mail out bal­lots in Brook­lyn and Queens.</p>
    <p>The foul-up was briefly ad­dressed on Tues­day at a Board of Elec­tions meet­ing, as Mr Ryan, a Demo­crat, said the er­ror was lim­ited to “one print run”. He added that the ven­dor would bear the cost of send­ing out new bal­lots to all po­ten­tially af­fected vot­ers.</p>
    <p>“It is es­sen­tial that con­fi­dence be es­tab­lished in this process and that we make cer­tain that all of the vot­ers who po­ten­tially have a prob­lem have a full and fair op­por­tu­nity to rem­edy that prob­lem,” Mr Ryan said.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials en­cour­aged vot­ers to email or call a hot­line if they re­ceived an er­ro­neous bal­lot. But phone lines al­ready ap­pear to be jammed.</p>
    <p>Ms Mer­rily Rosso, who lives in the Bush­wick neigh­bour­hood of Brook­lyn, re­ceived an ab­sen­tee bal­lot on Mon­day with a stranger’s name on it. She looked him up and dis­cov­ered that he lived nearby.</p>
    <p>Con­cerned, she called the Brook­lyn Board of Elec­tions twice. The first time, it hung up. The sec­ond time, the phone just rang.</p>
    <p>So she called the New York City Board of Elec­tions. There were roughly 80 call­ers ahead of her, and she hung up.</p>
    <p>Mr Michael Weiss, a mu­si­cian who lives in Park Slope, Brook­lyn, said the bal­lot mailed to his part­ner had some­one else’s name on it. He walked it over to the per­son listed on the bal­lot.</p>
    <p>“She opened her mail to find an­other neigh­bour’s bal­lot in her en­ve­lope, which I took and hand de­liv­ered to him around the cor­ner. Of course, he also re­ceived some­one else’s bal­lot in the mail,” Mr Weiss said.</p>
    <p>Phoenix Graph­ics, a fam­i­ly­owned firm, has worked with the city Board of Elec­tions since at least 2010, ac­cord­ing to city records, in­clud­ing dur­ing the June pri­maries.</p>
    <p>Wrong bal­lots signed by vot­ers will be in­valid.</p>
    <p>As part of an ef­fort to bat­tle mis­in­for­ma­tion, pop­u­lar video-shar­ing app TikTok on Tues­day launched a US elec­tion guide.</p>
    <p>TikTok’s in-app guide pro­vides links to voter reg­is­tra­tion pages and ac­cess to elec­tion in­for­ma­tion from sources such as the Na­tional As­so­ci­a­tion of Sec­re­taries of State and Bal­lotReady, ac­cord­ing to head of US pub­lic pol­icy Michael Beck­er­man.</p>
    <p>Bal­lotReady chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Alex Niem­czewski said: “Younger vot­ers of­ten do not re­alise ev­ery­thing that will ap­pear on their bal­lot, and we be­lieve that TikTok can help them vote their en­tire bal­lot.”</p>
    <p>The elec­tion guide makes its de­but as TikTok bat­tles to stop a ban or­dered by Pres­i­dent Trump. The com­pany has chal­lenged the ban in court as be­ing capri­cious and po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated.</p>
