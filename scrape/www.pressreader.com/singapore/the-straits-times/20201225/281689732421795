    <p>Her four-year-old daugh­ter had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, but the rest of the house­hold had tested neg­a­tive a week be­fore they were due to de­part on their lon­gawaited hol­i­day to Dis­ney World in Or­lando, Florida, the ne­ti­zen wrote on Face­book.</p>
    <p>“I am so dev­as­tated over the idea of can­celling this trip,” she wrote in the Dis­ney World Junkies Face­book group last week. “It was my four-year-old and six-year-old’s en­tire Christ­mas present, with­out it we have noth­ing re­ally to give them on Christ­mas morn­ing.”</p>
    <p>The mother went on to write that the fam­ily did not have any symp­toms and had been told that it “should be okay to go” ahead with their trip, while others told them to stay home.</p>
    <p>“I am un­be­liev­ably stressed and heart­bro­ken over the whole sit­u­a­tion! And I just have no idea what to do,” she said in the post that went vi­ral af­ter it was shared on Twit­ter, where ne­ti­zens lam­basted her for lack­ing a sense of per­spec­tive.</p>
    <p>In 2020, pub­lic shamers found a new word to de­scribe such in­di­vid­u­als who act self­ishly and put others at risk of catch­ing the coro­n­avirus: “co­vid­iot”.</p>
    <p>A port­man­teau of “Covid-19” and “id­iot”, a co­vid­iot is “a slang in­sult for some­one who dis­re­gards health and safety guide­lines about the novel coro­n­avirus”, ac­cord­ing to an ar­ti­cle on Dic­tionary.com</p>
    <p>Through­out the year, many ex­am­ples of “co­vid­iocy” have gone vi­ral.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­day in­stances in­clude peo­ple pulling down their masks to cough or sneeze, shop­pers in su­per­mar­kets and malls ar­gu­ing about hav­ing to wear face cov­er­ings, and peo­ple sell­ing masks made out of mesh or lace that ob­vi­ously do noth­ing to stop the spread of droplets.</p>
    <p>In another in­stance from the United States Labour Day week­end in Septem­ber, an Ohio po­lice­man found sev­eral col­lege stu­dents hang­ing out on a front porch un­masked, and warned them that they were break­ing pan­demic rules by hav­ing 20 peo­ple – twice the lo­cal limit – at the gath­er­ing.</p>
    <p>Upon run­ning a check on the iden­ti­fi­ca­tion card of one stu­dent, the po­lice­man learnt that he had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 a week ago.</p>
    <p>“Are you sup­posed to be quar­an­tin­ing? You have other peo­ple here and you are pos­i­tive for Covid?” the of­fi­cer asked, ac­cord­ing to footage from his body cam­era.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one at the party had the coro­n­avirus, the stu­dent replied, but later said it was two.</p>
    <p>Such in­stances were far from iso­lated across the US, where col­leges re­opened in the au­tumn. Stu­dents from the Univer­sity of Michi­gan even cre­ated an In­sta­gram ac­count – “umich_­co­vid­iots” – where other users could share hor­ror sto­ries of house par­ties, un­masked crowds and devil-may­care dor­mi­tory mates.</p>
    <p>While ex­am­ples of co­vid­iocy abound through­out the world, the US has proven par­tic­u­larly fer­tile ground for the spread of such be­hav­iour, to dev­as­tat­ing ef­fect. To date, 18.6 mil­lion in the coun­try have tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, and more than 330,000 have died from it.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem of fed­eral gov­ern­ment means that across the patch­work of 50 states and Wash­ing­ton, DC, lo­cal of­fi­cials are the ones who draw up pan­demic rules and pub­lic health and safety guide­lines.</p>
    <p>But there is lim­ited wide­spread en­force­ment of coro­n­avirus rules, with many politi­cians re­luc­tant to make those rules in the first place, ar­gu­ing that the rights of in­di­vid­u­als mean that com­mu­ni­ties should po­lice them­selves rather than be dic­tated to from on high.</p>
    <p>Com­pound­ing this are fringe groups of anti-mask pro­test­ers and ne­ti­zens – and even pub­lic fig­ures and politi­cians – who spread mis­in­for­ma­tion about sci­ence and facts, fu­elling doubt about mask re­quire­ments and crowd re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther are Amer­i­cans helped by a patch­work of of­ten con­tra­dic­tory pub­lic health and safety guide­lines, as lead­ers at­tempt to bal­ance the sur­vival of busi­nesses with gath­er­ing lim­its to curb the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, in Los An­ge­les, restau­rant own­ers have protested against a ban on out­door din­ing, ar­gu­ing that such a ban is il­log­i­cal when cater­ing sta­tions for film crews are al­lowed to oper­ate.</p>
    <p>Amer­ica has also gone for so long with­out flat­ten­ing the curve that quar­an­tine fa­tigue has set in, with peo­ple let­ting their guard down out of fa­tal­ism.</p>
    <p>None­the­less, pub­lic sham­ing of co­vid­iots, while cathar­tic, may not be pro­duc­tive, Har­vard Med­i­cal School epi­demi­ol­o­gist Ju­lia Mar­cus ar­gued in an es­say for The At­lantic in May.</p>
    <p>Mak­ing the case against an al­lor-noth­ing ap­proach to risk preven­tion, Pro­fes­sor Mar­cus ar­gued in­stead for a harm re­duc­tion model which recog­nises that some peo­ple would take risks any­way, and of­fers them ways to re­duce those risks.</p>
    <p>“The anger be­hind sham­ing is un­der­stand­able,” she wrote.</p>
    <p>“But, as years of re­search on HIV preven­tion have shown, sham­ing doesn’t elim­i­nate risky be­hav­iour – it just drives it un­der­ground.”</p>
    <p>She added: “Try­ing to shame peo­ple into 100 per cent risk re­duc­tion will be coun­ter­pro­duc­tive. What Amer­i­cans need now is a man­ual on how to have a life in a pan­demic.”</p>
