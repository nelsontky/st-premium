    <p>Here is a sen­tence I never in a mil­lion years thought that I would ever write or read: This Novem­ber, for the first time in our his­tory, the United States of Amer­ica may not be able to con­duct a free and fair elec­tion and, should Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump be de­feated by Mr Joe Bi­den, have a le­git­i­mate and peace­ful trans­fer of power.</p>
    <p>Be­cause if half the coun­try thinks their votes were not fully counted due to de­lib­er­ate sab­o­tag­ing of the US Postal Ser­vice (USPS) by this ad­min­is­tra­tion, and if the other half are made to be­lieve by the Pres­i­dent that any mail-in vote for Mr Bi­den was fraud­u­lent, that would not re­sult in just a dis­puted elec­tion – not an­other Bush v Gore for the Supreme Court to sort out – that would be the end of Amer­i­can democ­racy as we know it. It also isn’t hyper­bole to say it could sow the seeds of an­other Civil War.</p>
    <p>The threat is real.</p>
    <p>So, per­son­ally, I will walk, I will jog, I will skip, I will crawl, I will slither, I will bike, I will hike, I will hitch­hike, I will drive, I will ride, I will run, I will fly, I will roll, I will be rolled, I will be car­ried, I will trek, I will train, I will trot, I will truck, I will strut, I will float, I will boat, I will ram­ble, I will am­ble, I will march, I will bus, I will taxi, I will Uber, Lyft, scooter, skate­board or mo­tor­cy­cle – and I will wear a face mask, a face shield, gloves, gog­gles, a haz­mat suit, a space­suit or a wet suit – but I damn well will get to my neigh­bour­hood polling sta­tion to see that my vote for Mr Bi­den and Ms Ka­mala Har­ris is cast and counted on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>And it is not be­cause I am some rav­ing lib­eral. It’s be­cause I be­lieve that Amer­ica, at its core, is still a cen­tre-left, cen­tre-right coun­try and is best gov­erned by some­one who can re­forge the two and lead from there. I be­lieve that Mr Bi­den is the one who can do that best, and that is ac­tu­ally the source of his ap­peal to many Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>I un­der­stand that in the midst of a pan­demic, in-per­son vot­ing the way I in­tend to do is sim­ply not an op­tion for many peo­ple for rea­sons that have noth­ing to do with Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>To be­gin with, many re­tired peo­ple, who usu­ally staff polling sta­tions, are afraid to vol­un­teer this year out of fear of con­tract­ing the coro­n­avirus. And many other peo­ple le­git­i­mately fear that if they have to stand in crowded, longer lines at fewer polling sta­tions, this, too, could in­crease their like­li­hood of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Also, it is not Mr Trump’s fault, per se, that the Postal Ser­vice is not nor­mally set up to get a mas­sive crush of mail-in bal­lots out and back in time for ev­ery vote to be cast and counted.</p>
    <p>What is Mr Trump’s fault is that in­stead of lead­ing – pulling Congress and all the gov­er­nors to­gether to or­gan­ise an emer­gency re­sponse to this un­prece­dented chal­lenge posed to our na­tional elec­tion – the Pres­i­dent has used his bully pul­pit to try to per­suade the coun­try that any mail-in vote – ex­cept in states that might sup­port him, like Florida – should be seen as fraud­u­lent, and he has de­lib­er­ately sought to choke off funds to the Postal Ser­vice needed for an emer­gency ex­pan­sion of its ca­pac­ity to ef­fi­ciently han­dle all these votes by mail.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump said in a news con­fer­ence last week that he would not sign off on ei­ther US$25 bil­lion (S$34 bil­lion) in emer­gency funds for the USPS or US$3.5 bil­lion in elec­tion as­sis­tance to help states, both of which Democrats have been press­ing for as part of a fed­eral Covid-19 re­lief Bill.</p>
    <p>“They need that money in or­der to have the post of­fice work, so it can take all of these mil­lions and mil­lions of bal­lots,” Mr Trump told Fox Busi­ness Net­work the next day.</p>
    <p>“But if they don’t get those two items, that means you can’t have uni­ver­sal mail-in vot­ing, be­cause they’re not equipped to have it.”</p>
    <p>I have cov­ered banana repub­lic dic­ta­tors who were more sub­tle than that in at­tempt­ing to rig their elec­tions or un­der­mine votes for their op­po­nent.</p>
    <p>What to do pol­i­cy­wise? Bom­bard your con­gress­man’s and se­na­tors’ of­fices with e-mail and protests, pro­tect your neigh­bour­hood mail­box from be­ing re­moved and, most im­por­tant, join those pro­test­ers in the streets out­side the north-west DC home of Mr Trump’s Post­mas­ter Gen­eral Louis DeJoy, putting him on no­tice that if he does not change his ways, for the rest of his life, ev­ery­where he goes, ev­ery restau­rant he en­ters, ev­ery movie he at­tends, ev­ery time he walks his dog, peo­ple will say, “There goes the man who de­lib­er­ately evis­cer­ated the Postal Ser­vice so that Amer­i­cans could not have their votes counted in the 2020 elec­tion.”</p>
    <p>That prospect al­ready seems to have made some head­way with Mr DeJoy. While the Pres­i­dent con­tin­ues to plant ut­terly bo­gus seeds of doubt ev­ery­where he can about mail-in vot­ing, Mr DeJoy on Tues­day de­clared that he was sus­pend­ing cost-cut­ting and other op­er­a­tional changes.</p>
    <p>But we can­not rely on Mr DeJoy or Mr Trump to play this elec­tion straight. For in­stance, Mr DeJoy didn’t say that he would re­verse moves al­ready made that have been cited as in­tended to un­der­cut vote-by-mail.</p>
    <p>We have to help ev­ery lo­cal­ity re­cruit more poll work­ers – Repub­li­cans and Democrats, we need mul­ti­tudes of both to en­sure ev­ery­one feels rep­re­sented – so that polling sta­tions can open and han­dle ev­ery­one who wants to vote.</p>
    <p>If you are young and healthy or have re­cov­ered from Covid-19, vol­un­teer to work at the polls. Go to the US Elec­tion As­sis­tance Com­mis­sion’s web­site for de­tails on how to be­come a poll worker and rules for vot­ing in each state.</p>
    <p>At the same time, go to vote.org/am-i-reg­is­tered-to-vote and make sure you are reg­is­tered to vote and, if you are and want to vote by mail, go to vote.org/ab­sen­tee-bal­lot and se­cure an ab­sen­tee bal­lot for the Novem­ber elec­tion.</p>
