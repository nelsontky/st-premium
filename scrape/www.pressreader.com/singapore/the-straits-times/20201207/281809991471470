    <p>TOKYO/MEL­BOURNE • Japan has re­trieved a cap­sule of as­ter­oid dust from Aus­tralia’s re­mote out­back af­ter a six-year mis­sion that may help un­cover more about the ori­gins of the plan­ets and wa­ter, the Asian na­tion’s space agency said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The mis­sion of the Ja­panese space­craft, Hayabusa2, spot­lights Asia’s grow­ing role in space ex­plo­ration, with a Chi­nese ro­botic ve­hi­cle col­lect­ing lu­nar sam­ples last week for the first time since the 1970s.</p>
    <p>A he­li­copter flew the cap­sule from the un­manned craft, con­tain­ing the first ex­ten­sive sam­ples of as­ter­oid dust, from the land­ing site in Aus­tralia’s desert to a do­mes­tic re­search fa­cil­ity of the Japan Aerospace Ex­plo­ration Agency (Jaxa).</p>
    <p>“The probe landed on the as­ter­oid twice, and the sec­ond time it cre­ated an ar­ti­fi­cial crater and col­lected some de­bris,” agency pres­i­dent Hiroshi Yamakawa told a news con­fer­ence. “I hope this will shed light on how the so­lar sys­tem was formed and how wa­ter was brought to earth.”</p>
    <p>The cap­sule may also con­tain some gas, which will be ex­tracted in Aus­tralia, Dr Yamakawa added.</p>
    <p>The space­craft, launched in 2014 from Japan’s Tane­gashima space cen­tre, jour­neyed for four years to the as­ter­oid Ryugu, where it gath­ered a sam­ple and headed home in Novem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>Spec­ta­tors gath­ered at a theatre near the Ja­panese cap­i­tal of Tokyo to view the re­turn clapped and waved ban­ners in NHK footage, with one woman in tears.</p>
    <p>They wore masks and kept a dis­tance from one an­other as pre­cau­tions against the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>As­ter­oids are be­lieved to have formed at the dawn of the so­lar sys­tem, and sci­en­tists say the sam­ples may con­tain or­ganic mat­ter that could have con­trib­uted to life on earth.</p>
    <p>“What we are re­ally do­ing here is try­ing to sam­ple this pris­tine rock that has not been ir­ra­di­ated by the sun,” as­tro­physi­cist Lisa Har­veySmith told the Aus­tralian Broad­cast­ing Cor­po­ra­tion. Gases trapped in the rock sam­ples could re­veal more about con­di­tions pre­vail­ing about 4.6 bil­lion years ago, she added.</p>
    <p>The re­trieval of the cap­sule also high­lights close tech­ni­cal co­op­er­a­tion be­tween Japan and Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>“Our job sup­port­ing Jaxa will not be com­plete un­til we see the sam­ple... safely leaves Aus­tralia and re­turns to Japan,” head of the Aus­tralian Space Agency Me­gan Clark told the news con­fer­ence. “And then the sam­ple will start to tell its sto­ries and re­veal to us some won­der­ful signs about how wa­ter ar­rived on our earth and how we even may have been formed, such as our or­gan­ics, car­bon-based an­i­mals, hu­mans, and plants,” she added.</p>
    <p>Half the ma­te­rial will be shared be­tween Jaxa, United States space agency Nasa and other in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions, and the rest kept for fu­ture study as ad­vances are made in an­a­lytic tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Japan’s craft, named for the pere­grine fal­con, a bird of prey, or­bited above the as­ter­oid f or a few months to map its sur­face be­fore land­ing. It used small ex­plo­sives to blast a crater and col­lected the re­sult­ing de­bris.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Hayabusa2 dropped off the cap­sule, it changed course and headed back into space.</p>
    <p>The cap­sule lit up on re-en­try into the at­mos­phere early yes­ter­day and landed in the Woomera re­stricted area, about 460km north of Ade­laide, the space agency said.</p>
    <p>Hayabusa2 will now be­gin an ex­tended mis­sion tar­get­ing two new as­ter­oids. It will com­plete a se­ries of or­bits around the sun for around six years be­fore ap­proach­ing the first of its tar­get as­ter­oids – named 2001 CC21 – in July 2026.</p>
