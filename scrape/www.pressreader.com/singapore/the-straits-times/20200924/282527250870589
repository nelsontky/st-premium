    <p>THE TUN­NEL</p>
    <p>Disas­ter movies are com­pe­ti­tions of scale. Each wants to be big­ger and more deadly than the last. There is an ob­ses­sion with es­cape and hero­ism. The hero dis­re­gards the rules – there are lives to be saved, darn it, and he will not abide by the rule book and see them die. Not on his watch.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, the Nor­we­gian­lan­guage The Tun­nel plays out as slow-mo­tion hor­ror, made all the more hor­ri­fy­ing be­cause so much of it is based on fact. Open­ing cards tell au­di­ences that there are</p>
    <p>1,100 tun­nels in Nor­way. Most do not have es­cape routes and that eight ma­jor fires have oc­curred in these moun­tain pas­sage­ways since 2011.</p>
    <p>It is close to Christ­mas and the masses are out on the road, try­ing to make it home for the hol­i­days. Stein (Thor­b­jorn Harr) is an emer­gency res­cue worker about to take a desk job when the worst hap­pens: Some­where in a 9km-long tun­nel, a fire has bro­ken out.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of deaths from a tun­nel fire might not be on the scale of a Los An­ge­les su­perquake or a tsunami striking Ja­pan’s east coast, but di­rec­tor Pal Ole prefers to in­duce fear, not awe. Peo­ple here do not out­run ex­plo­sions. They suf­fo­cate from smoke that creeps into their cars, lit­tle by lit­tle.</p>
    <p>Deaths in this film hap­pen for the most triv­ial rea­sons, but in real life, that is how man-made dis­as­ters oc­cur. Here, the line be­tween catas­tro­phe and safety is shock­ingly thin, rest­ing on fac­tors such as the amount of snow­fall, the vol­ume of traf­fic, in which di­rec­tion a street cam­era is po­si­tioned and the num­ber of ven­ti­la­tion fans in oper­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The tone is so re­al­is­tic that at times, the film feels more like a re-en­act­ment of a past tragedy of the sort found on ca­ble-tele­vi­sion doc­u­men­taries.</p>
    <p>The au­then­tic­ity ex­tends to hu­man be­hav­iour as well. When disas­ter strikes, a cog­ni­tive fog de­scends on all in­volved and this film por­trays the con­fu­sion well.</p>
    <p>At a tun­nel op­er­a­tions cen­tre ev­ery few min­utes, the ar­rival of in­for­ma­tion on a piece­meal ba­sis throws things into dis­ar­ray, while in­side the tun­nel, mo­torists stare at one an­other, as if to ask: “How scared should I be right now?”</p>
    <p>MADE IN ITALY</p>
    <p>Heavy emo­tional truths are un­packed in Made In Italy, a story of a group of Brits whose North­ern Euro­pean shells melt away un­der the rays of a golden Tus­can sun, leav­ing souls un­bared.</p>
    <p>If that set-up sounds corny, that is be­cause it is, and ac­tor James D’Arcy, mak­ing his di­rec­to­rial de­but, is ill-equipped to ex­ca­vate any­thing in his screen­play that feels fresh or pro­found.</p>
    <p>Robert (Liam Nee­son) is a free-spir­ited artist brought into col­li­sion with es­tranged son Jack (Micheal Richard­son) be­cause of the crum­bling home left to them by Jack’s dead mother, a na­tive of the re­gion.</p>
    <p>The home is ob­vi­ously a stand-in for the re­la­tion­ship and as the ne­glected struc­ture is re­vived, so is the bond be­tween fa­ther and son. Nee­son and Richard­son – fa­ther and son in real life – do a fine job por­tray­ing what it is like to rip wounds open so they can heal in­stead of fes­ter.</p>
    <p>But the sur­round­ing sub-plot, in­volv­ing a need­lessly com­pli­cated se­duc­tion that takes place amid a heav­ily ro­man­ti­cised ver­sion of Italy – the food, the ar­chi­tec­ture and the charm of a peo­ple who live life to the fullest – might cause eye-rolling to oc­cur. Eat Pray Love (2010) syn­drome, the re­duc­tion of a “for­eign cul­ture” to not much more than a spa treat­ment, is alive and well.</p>
    <p>THE SE­CRETS WE KEEP</p>
    <p>The er­ratic The Se­crets We Keep opens promis­ingly. Maja (Noomi Ra­pace), a sur­vivor of hor­rific World War II ex­pe­ri­ences, is liv­ing in post-war United States when she spots a man, Thomas (Joel Kin­na­man). She be­lieves him to be a par­tic­u­larly sadis­tic former Ger­man sol­dier, liv­ing in plain sight with a new iden­tity. But the only per­son who can help her, hus­band Lewis (Chris Messina), also the town doc­tor, thinks she is mis­taken.</p>
    <p>This movie is a re­make of Death And The Maiden (1994), which is based on the play of the same name. The orig­i­nal shows were set in an un­named South Amer­i­can coun­try, with the sus­pected vil­lains ac­cused of work­ing for a bru­tal former regime.</p>
    <p>For some rea­son, that set­ting has been changed. The orig­i­nal themes of doubt and vengeance strug­gle to emerge – how much proof is re­quired for crimes as bar­baric as those that Thomas is sup­posed to have com­mit­ted? What pun­ish­ment is ap­pro­pri­ate? – but this up­date’s fix­a­tion on achiev­ing a bloody cathar­sis drowns out other ideas.</p>
    <p>OKAY! MADAM</p>
    <p>Films open­ing this week but not re­viewed in­clude the South Korean ac­tion-com­edy Okay! Madam. Mi-young (Uhm Jeong-hwa) is a bread-seller in a mar­ket. When her hus­band wins a trip, she looks for­ward to mak­ing her first over­seas hol­i­day. Af­ter ter­ror­ists take over her flight, a side of her un­known to ev­ery­one, in­clud­ing her­self, be­gins to emerge.</p>
