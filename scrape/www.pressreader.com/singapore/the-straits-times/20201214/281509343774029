    <p>In­stead of nasal swabs, those who need to be tested for Covid-19 in Sin­ga­pore may soon have the op­tion of of­fer­ing their saliva sam­ple, fol­low­ing the de­vel­op­ment of a test kit here.</p>
    <p>The Res­o­lute 2.0 kit was de­vel­oped by the Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search’s Di­ag­nos­tics De­vel­op­ment (DxD) Hub and DSO Na­tional Lab­o­ra­to­ries in July.</p>
    <p>While it al­lows for tests us­ing nasal swabs, the kits also fa­cil­i­tate Covid-19 test­ing us­ing saliva.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients have to draw saliva from deep within their throats</p>
    <p>which they then spit into a spec­i­men bot­tle.</p>
    <p>Un­like nasal and throat swabs, this type of saliva test­ing does not re­quire as­sis­tance from swab­bers or med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als, which pro­tects them from be­ing po­ten­tially ex­posed to the virus.</p>
    <p>The Res­o­lute 2.0 poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) test kit can han­dle this non-in­va­sive method of ob­tain­ing sam­ples, com­pared with the more com­monly used na­sopha­ryn­geal (back of the nose) or oropha­ryn­geal (back of the throat) swab­bing.</p>
    <p>The PCR test has been de­scribed as the “gold stan­dard” of Covid-19 de­tec­tion dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The kit is li­censed to be man­u­fac­tured and dis­trib­uted by med­i­cal de­vice com­pany Ad­vanced MedTech Hold­ings.</p>
    <p>The com­pany last Thurs­day an­nounced that the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity (HSA) has given its ap­proval for the first Covid-19 deep throat saliva test here.</p>
    <p>Changi Air­port’s new Covid-19 test­ing lab – slated to open in the first quar­ter of next year – will use Res­o­lute 2.0.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted, Changi Air­port Group said no de­ci­sion has been made on whether saliva test­ing will be avail­able to pas­sen­gers at the air­port.</p>
    <p>In its state­ment, Ad­vanced MedTech Hold­ings said clin­i­cal stud­ies con­ducted on saliva sam­ples were able to ac­cu­rately iden­tify all the known pos­i­tive cases.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s group chief ex­ec­u­tive Abel Ang added: “No pa­tient wants to have a swab poked up their nose or the back of their throat.”</p>
    <p>He said the Res­o­lute 2.0 kit could ben­e­fit the coun­try as it steps up test­ing in re­open­ing the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>A saliva sam­ple taken from deep in the throat is not the same as from around the mouth, said DxD Hub’s vice-pres­i­dent Weng Ruifen.</p>
    <p>The Res­o­lute 2.0 kit can be com­pleted in an hour, com­pared with a con­ven­tional PCR test, which takes 21/ hours or longer to pro</p>
    <p>2 duce re­sults.</p>
    <p>It is cur­rently be­ing used i n places in­clud­ing Park­wayHealth Lab­o­ra­tory, In­no­va­tive Di­ag­nos­tics labs and Raf­fles Med­i­cal Group.</p>
    <p>Ad­vanced MedTech Hold­ings said it is work­ing with the Min­istry of Health to of­fer saliva test­ing in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
