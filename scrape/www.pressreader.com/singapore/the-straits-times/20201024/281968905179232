    <p>Bri­tain signed a trade deal with Ja­pan yes­ter­day, its first with a ma­jor econ­omy since Brexit, as the clock runs down on Bri­tish ef­forts to reach an agree­ment with the Euro­pean Union by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>In a cer­e­mony in Tokyo, Bri­tain’s In­ter­na­tional Trade Sec­re­tary Liz Truss and Ja­panese For­eign Min­is­ter Toshim­itsu Motegi put their names to the pact, which was reached in prin­ci­ple last month, about three months af­ter for­mal ne­go­ti­a­tions be­gan.</p>
    <p>The deal largely pre­serves the terms un­der which Bri­tain traded with Tokyo as a mem­ber of the EU, ac­cord­ing to Ja­pan’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>It is ex­pected to boost Bri­tain’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct by 0.07 per cent com­pared with 2018 lev­els over the next 15 years, the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment has said.</p>
    <p>“It used to be said that an in­de­pen­dent UK would not be able to strike ma­jor trade deals, or they would take years to con­clude,” Ms Truss told re­porters af­ter the sign­ing. “But to­day, we proved the naysay­ers wrong with this ground­break­ing, Bri­tish-shaped deal that was agreed in record time.”</p>
    <p>The agree­ment will also help open the way for Bri­tain to join the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (TPP), Ms Truss added.</p>
    <p>Mr Motegi re­it­er­ated that Ja­pan will con­tinue to sup­port Bri­tain’s bid to join the TPP, which is a trade agree­ment in­volv­ing 11 coun­tries across the re­gion, in­clud­ing Aus­tralia, Viet­nam and Canada.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s pact im­proves ac­cess to Bri­tain’s mar­ket for Ja­panese train cars and some auto parts, and adds rules on digital trade and fi­nan­cial ser­vices. Bri­tain’s De­part­ment for In­ter­na­tional Trade said it pro­vides be­spoke ben­e­fits that go be­yond the EU deal, in­clud­ing in ar­eas such as digital and data, fi­nan­cial ser­vices, food and drink, and cre­ative in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>“Fi­nan­cial ser­vices firms look­ing to op­er­ate in Ja­pan will find it eas­ier to get a li­cence,” In­ter­na­tional Trade Min­is­ter Greg Hands told Bloomberg TV yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“It’s good news for fin­tech firms be­cause we’ve re­moved un­nec­es­sary data lo­cal­i­sa­tion rules,” he said, cit­ing money trans­fer com­pa­nies Trans­fer­Wise and Revo­lut as spe­cific ben­e­fi­cia­ries.</p>
    <p>While the eco­nomic im­pact is mod­est – Bri­tain is Ja­pan’s 18thlarges­t trade part­ner – the ac­cord with the world’s third-largest econ­omy is a bright spot for Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son, who promised that Brexit would be an op­por­tu­nity for Bri­tain to strike bet­ter deals as an in­de­pen­dent coun­try.</p>
    <p>The sign­ing came as Mr John­son’s gov­ern­ment restarted ne­go­ti­a­tions with the EU on Thurs­day, in a bid to avoid tar­iffs and quo­tas be­ing reim­posed when Bri­tain de­parts from the sin­gle mar­ket and Cus­toms union on Dec 31.</p>
