    <p>SYDNEY • Cit­i­group, Deutsche Bank, Aus­tralia and New Zealand Bank­ing Group (ANZ) and six of the firms’ for­mer staff were com­mit­ted to stand trial in Aus­tralia yes­ter­day after plead­ing not guilty to col­lud­ing dur­ing a share is­sue.</p>
    <p>In the coun­try’s big­gest whitecol­lar crim­i­nal case, the Aus­tralian Com­pe­ti­tion and Con­sumer Com­mis­sion (ACCC) has brought charges against the fi­nan­cial gi­ants, their client and their for­mer ex­ec­u­tives, ac­cus­ing them of col­lud­ing to keep stock they were try­ing to sell to stop the price fall­ing.</p>
    <p>The mat­ter has crawled through nu­mer­ous hear­ings in a Sydney court as lawyers for each de­fen­dant sought to cross-ex­am­ine pros­e­cu­tion wit­nesses and ques­tion whether reg­u­la­tors fol­lowed due process as they gath­ered ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>Now, with the for­mal pleas of not guilty, the mat­ter will go to trial in the Fed­eral Court, more than two years since t he charges were brought and five years since the A$2.5 bil­lion (S$2.48 bil­lion) stock is­sue for ANZ took place. A trial date has not yet been set.</p>
    <p>ACCC chair Rod Sims de­clined to com­ment since the mat­ter was be­fore the court.</p>
    <p>Citi de­nied the al­le­ga­tions, as it has done through­out, while Deutsche Bank said it would de­fend the charges.</p>
    <p>ANZ, Aus­tralia’s fourth-largest re­tail bank, de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>The case is be­ing closely watched by fi­nan­cial mar­ket par­tic­i­pants around the world be­cause it could in­flu­ence how cap­i­tal rais­ings are con­ducted.</p>
    <p>For com­pa­nies, each crim­i­nal car­tel charge could mean a fine of up to A$10 mil­lion or three times the amount the com­pany ben­e­fited from the ac­tions in ques­tion, which­ever is greater.</p>
    <p>In­di­vid­u­als face a max­i­mum of 10 years’ im­pris­on­ment, fines of up to A$420,000, or both.</p>
