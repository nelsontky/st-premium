    <p>LES­BOS (Greece) Thou­sands of mi­grants roamed home­less around the Greek is­land of Les­bos yes­ter­day af­ter flee­ing overnight fires that gut­ted their over­crowded camp, and the au­thor­i­ties are wor­ried some asy­lum seek­ers who tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 could spread the virus.</p>
    <p>A mi­gra­tion min­istry of­fi­cial said the Mo­ria camp, which hosts more than 12,000 peo­ple, was “prob­a­bly to­tally de­stroyed”.</p>
    <p>Athens put Les­bos un­der a state of emer­gency and sent po­lice re­in­force­ments to the is­land, which lies just off Turkey, to help keep or­der.</p>
    <p>Deputy Mi­gra­tion Min­is­ter Ge­orge Koumout­sakos said about 3,000 mi­grants and refugees would be tem­po­rar­ily housed in tents as the gov­ern­ment strug­gles to find al­ter­na­tive shel­ter for the mi­grants, some of whom were now camped out in fields nearby.</p>
    <p>The cause of the fires is not yet known. The au­thor­i­ties are in­ves­ti­gat­ing whether they were de­lib­er­ately started. The fire broke out just af­ter mid­night. By dawn yes­ter­day, most of the camp was a smoul­der­ing mass of burnt con­tain­ers and tents, with a few peo­ple go­ing through the de­bris to look for their pos­ses­sions.</p>
    <p>The where­abouts of 35 mi­grants who tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 this week were un­known. The camp was placed un­der quar­an­tine last week af­ter an asy­lum seeker tested pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>“There was not just one but many fires in the camp. Mi­grants threw stones at fire­fight­ers try­ing to put out the fires. The cause is un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion,” Mr Con­stan­tine Theophilop­ou­los, fire brigade chief for the north­ern Aegean, told ERT TV.</p>
    <p>Ini­tial re­ports sug­gested the fires broke out at dif­fer­ent lo­ca­tions in the sprawl­ing camp af­ter the au­thor­i­ties tried to iso­late some in­di­vid­u­als who had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“The camp has been evac­u­ated.</p>
    <p>All these peo­ple are on the na­tional road to­wards (the town of) Mytilini,” said Mr Pana­gi­o­tis Deli­gian­nis, a wit­ness from Mo­ria. “There are po­lice out who are not let­ting them through. These peo­ple are sleep­ing left and right in the fields.”</p>
    <p>Aid groups have long crit­i­cised con­di­tions at the camp, which hosts more than four times its stated ca­pac­ity. They say it is im­pos­si­ble to im­ple­ment so­cial dis­tanc­ing and ba­sic hy­giene mea­sures there.</p>
    <p>The United Na­tions refugee</p>
    <p>agency, UNHCR, said it had re­ceived re­ports of ten­sions be­tween peo­ple in neigh­bour­ing vil­lages and asy­lum seek­ers who were try­ing to reach Mytilini town.</p>
    <p>“Events in Mo­ria last night are un­think­able but trag­i­cally pre­dictable as the dire sit­u­a­tion on the is­lands has gone on for far too long,” said Ms Dim­i­tra Kalogeropo­ulou, In­ter­na­tional Res­cue Com­mit­tee Greece di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>Les­bos was put un­der a state of emer­gency for four months for pub</p>
    <p>lic health rea­sons, the civil pro­tec­tion ser­vice said, which al­lows it to mo­bilise all forces to sup­port the is­land and asy­lum seek­ers.</p>
    <p>Mytilini Mayor Stratis Kytelis said mi­grants would have to be moved or housed on ships to pre­vent the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mr Ar­gyris Syvris, a po­lice­man, told Open TV that po­lice had been forced to re­lease some 200 peo­ple who were due to be repa­tri­ated to their coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Greek Prime Min­is­ter Kyr­i­akos</p>
    <p>Mit­so­takis held an emer­gency Cabi­net meet­ing on the sit­u­a­tion, and the mi­gra­tion and in­te­rior min­is­ters headed to Les­bos.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment spokesman Ste­lios Pet­sas said camp res­i­dents would not be al­lowed to leave Les­bos due to the pan­demic, though EU Home Affairs Com­mis­sioner Ylva Jo­hans­son said the Euro­pean Union had agreed to fund the im­me­di­ate trans­fer of 400 un­ac­com­pa­nied chil­dren and teenagers to the Greek main­land.</p>
