    <p>The world is rac­ing to­wards a Covid-19 vac­cine, and ef­forts by a local sci­en­tist have also put Sin­ga­pore in the run­ning to de­velop one.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong of the Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School is co-de­vel­oper of a Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­date that is among only 51 in the world be­ing tested on hu­mans.</p>
    <p>Prof Ooi, 53, said it was sat­is­fy­ing to know that his team’s re­search is be­ing ap­plied to de­vel­op­ing and eval­u­at­ing a new vac­cine to solve a global health prob­lem.</p>
    <p>“That we were able to con­trib­ute to a rapid de­vel­op­ment of our vac­cine can­di­date, and be among those in the clin­i­cal phase of test­ing, is a bonus,” said Prof Ooi. He had grad­u­ated from St Joseph’s In­sti­tu­tion and Na­tional Ju­nior College in Sin­ga­pore be­fore pur­su­ing med­i­cal train­ing at the Univer­sity of Not­ting­ham Med­i­cal School.</p>
    <p>Now, he is driven by the urge to give back to so­ci­ety through sci­ence, though the ac­cel­er­ated time­line has been a chal­lenge. His team has over­come this by con­duct­ing mul­ti­ple ex­per­i­ments si­mul­ta­ne­ously, in­stead of se­quen­tially.</p>
    <p>“Even though there was ur­gency in de­vel­op­ing a vac­cine, it was im­per­a­tive we pro­vide the same qual­ity of ev­i­dence to show that the vac­cine is likely to be safe in hu­mans and has a chance of elic­it­ing pro­tec­tive im­mu­nity,” said the pro­fes­sor of emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases.</p>
    <p>The early-phase tri­als for the Lu­nar-Cov19 vac­cine co-de­vel­oped by Prof Ooi and Amer­i­can phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics be­gan in Sin­ga­pore in Oc­to­ber. Pre­lim­i­nary re­sults were pos­i­tive, and The Straits Times had ear­lier re­ported that late-stage tri­als are ex­pected to be­gin be­fore the end of the year.</p>
    <p>The Lu­nar-Cov19 vac­cine lever­ages a new tech­nol­ogy called mes­sen­ger RNA (mRNA), sim­i­lar to the can­di­dates be­ing de­vel­oped by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, with one dif­fer­ence. The Lu­narCov19 mRNA mol­e­cule is a repli­cat­ing one that makes mul­ti­ple copies of the vi­ral spike pro­tein af­ter the in­jec­tion. The other two are not.</p>
    <p>Prof Ooi said the repli­ca­tion more closely mim­ics how a vi­ral in­fec­tion plays out in the body, and could coax a stronger im­mune re­sponse from the body.</p>
    <p>His team is hope­ful that the vac­cine could work with only one dose. On the other hand, the vac­cines by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech re­quire two doses.</p>
    <p>As he bat­tles the clock to pro­duce a vac­cine, Prof Ooi stresses that the work done on it was a re­sult of team­work. “Many peo­ple in Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics, the SingHealth In­ves­ti­ga­tional Medicine Unit and my lab worked long hours and even over week­ends to meet am­bi­tious time­lines so that vac­cines would be avail­able to the Sin­ga­pore pop­u­la­tion sooner rather than later,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added: “This nom­i­na­tion would not be pos­si­ble without them and would only be mean­ing­ful if done on their be­half.”</p>
