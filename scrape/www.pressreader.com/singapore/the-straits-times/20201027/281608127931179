    <p>BANGKOK • Pic­tures of coffins and guns, and threats of death and vi­o­lence – protests tar­get­ing Thai­land’s gov­ern­ment and monar­chy have hard­ened feel­ings among ul­tra­roy­al­ists, who are push­ing back with ag­gres­sive abuse on­line.</p>
    <p>The mes­sages, some of which have got thou­sands of likes, are a dan­ger sign for some, who point to the vi­o­lent con­fronta­tions that have rocked Thai­land in the past.</p>
    <p>The threat­en­ing rhetoric fol­lows months of stu­dent-led ral­lies that have drawn tens of thou­sands of peo­ple call­ing for demo­cratic re­form and changes to the monar­chy – pre­vi­ously a taboo sub­ject.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple who insult the monar­chy de­serve to die!” wrote one Face­book user, hurl­ing in­sults at prominent ac­tivist Anon Nampa – a key fig­ure push­ing for royal re­form. “Thai­land doesn’t need peo­ple like you!”</p>
    <p>Some memes cir­cu­lat­ing on so­cial me­dia threaten vi­o­lence – from a ri­fle-wield­ing man claim­ing the monar­chy must be “de­fended at all costs” to a pic­ture of a cof­fin pho­to­shopped next to an ac­tivist.</p>
    <p>For­mer MP Warong Dechgitvi­grom, who founded pro-monar­chy group Thai Pakdee (Loyal Thais), in­sisted his com­pa­tri­ots are peace­ful.</p>
    <p>“We have no in­ten­tion of us­ing vi­o­lence,” the 59-year-old re­tired gy­nae­col­o­gist told Agence FrancePres­se (AFP).</p>
    <p>The monar­chy is nec­es­sary for sta­bil­ity, he in­sisted, slam­ming Thai­land’s “brain­washed” youth.</p>
    <p>“They don’t want to re­form roy­alty, they want to de­stroy it,” Mr Warong said. “With­out a monar­chy, there would be a civil war.”</p>
    <p>King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn sits at the apex of Thai power, flanked by the mil­i­tary and the coun­try’s bil­lion­aire busi­ness elite.</p>
    <p>His in­flu­ence – and that of his late fa­ther Bhu­mi­bol Adulyadej, who reigned for 70 years – per­me­ates ev­ery as­pect of Thai so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>The royal fam­ily is pro­tected by one of the world’s harsh­est royal defama­tion laws; any per­ceived crit­i­cism can land a per­son in jail for up to 15 years per charge.</p>
    <p>But the stu­dent de­mands for re­form have shat­tered those norms, with some demon­stra­tors car­ry­ing “Re­pub­lic of Thai­land” signs at ral­lies. Many protesters even failed to kneel ear­lier this month when a royal mo­tor­cade passed – as dic­tated by cen­turies-old tra­di­tion – and in­stead bran­dished a de­fi­ant three-fin­ger salute.</p>
    <p>While he has not pub­licly com­mented on the protest move­ment, the King has made re­cent pub­lic ap­pear­ances among sup­port­ers – a rare charm of­fen­sive for the monarch, who spends long stints away in Europe.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, af­ter an of­fi­cial cer­e­mony, the King and his wife, Queen Suthida, broke with royal pro­to­col to praise a sup­porter who held up a por­trait of the King’s late par­ents at a pro-democ­racy rally.</p>
    <p>“Very brave. So good. Thank you,” the King told the man, ac­cord­ing to video footage posted on Face­book.</p>
    <p>That quote was trend­ing as a hash­tag on Twit­ter at the week­end, along with #fight­on­majesty.</p>
    <p>Some ul­tra-roy­al­ists have called for fur­ther ac­tion against the grow­ing pro-democ­racy move­ment.</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing protesters as “garbage who need to be dis­posed of”, a for­mer mil­i­tary gen­eral has launched a Face­book group tar­get­ing those who have called for re­form.</p>
    <p>“I am will­ing to go to jail for my ac­tions be­cause I need to pro­tect the monar­chy at any cost,” Mr Rien­thong Nanna wrote on his page, in a mes­sage that drew 13,000 likes and was shared 850 times.</p>
    <p>Such on­line ag­gres­sion could eas­ily spill over into real life, wor­ries Mr Pa­trick Jory, an aca­demic with Aus­tralia’s Univer­sity of Queens­land who has stud­ied pre­vi­ous demo­cratic move­ments in Thai­land.</p>
    <p>“When­ever the monar­chy has felt threat­ened, (the state) has al­ways re­sponded with vi­o­lence,” he said, not­ing pat­terns of tur­moil in the 1970s, 1990s and 2010.</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s pow­er­ful mil­i­tary and bil­lion­aire clans have ev­ery in­cen­tive to en­sure the sta­tus quo goes un­changed, he added. “All of the in­ter­ests that are guar­an­teed by the monar­chy, and ac­tu­ally their own per­sonal sta­tus in Thai so­ci­ety”, would be un­der threat if there is real royal re­form, he said.</p>
    <p>But paint­ing all roy­al­ists as wealthy or part of an elite es­tab­lish­ment is un­fair, said roy­al­ist Sir­i­lak Kasem­sawat, a tour guide from Ubon Ratchathan­i prov­ince.</p>
    <p>“I am an or­di­nary per­son,” she said as she waited to pay her re­spects to the royal mo­tor­cade ear­lier this month. “We want to show that we love the King.”</p>
