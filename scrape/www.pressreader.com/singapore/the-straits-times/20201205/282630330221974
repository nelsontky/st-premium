    <p>Ev­ery era has new sci­ence at its beck and the lat­est tech­nol­ogy at its call. Com­put­ers spit out data and un­der­wa­ter cam­eras study tech­nique. Older ath­letes trav­elled alone, mod­ern ones with an en­tourage of chefs, psy­chol­o­gists and pets. The 1960s might be fun to visit, if noth­ing else be­cause it was a sim­pler time. There were no chairs at ten­nis changeover­s.</p>
    <p>Imag­ine if some­one lent you a time ma­chine for a week. Let you pick a seat in any sta­dium in any era.</p>
    <p>Gave you the lib­erty to wan­der through any gen­er­a­tion of sport. Where would you go?</p>
    <p>I know my des­ti­na­tion. Au­drey Hep­burn and Bil­lie Jean King. Elvis and Ge­orge Best. The Bea­tles and Brazil. Folks say this gen­er­a­tion is the great­est but I want to go back and see The Great­est.</p>
    <p>The late 1950s-early 1970s are an un­de­feated ro­man­tic age in my mind. You think mums play­ing sport now is cool, then what about gym­nast Larisa Latyn­ina at the 1958 world cham­pi­onships: Four months preg­nant, five golds.</p>
    <p>Or what about Gar­rin­cha in Chile 1962, his bow-legged foot­ball bal­lads so di­vine that Uruguayan writer Ed­uardo Galeano wrote in his book Soc­cer In The Sun And Shadow: “He was the one who climbed out of the train­ing-camp win­dow be­cause he heard from far-off back al­leys the call of a ball ask­ing to be played with, mu­sic de­mand­ing to be danced to, a woman want­ing to be kissed.”</p>
    <p>I find Messi fab­u­lous, but would we ever write like this about him?</p>
    <p>Of course, this era has been sub­lime. Cris­tiano with pol­ished boot and Serena with stern racket. Michael Phelps in wa­ter, Usain Bolt on land, Ye­lena Isinbayeva in air. Ele­men­tal ge­niuses, who have buried us in medals, goals, ti­tles, and we’ve seen it all “live” on mul­ti­ple chan­nels.</p>
    <p>How do you beat that?</p>
    <p>But we get so wrapped in the present that we forget ev­ery gen­er­a­tion dur­ing its time is un­beat­able. St­effi Graf, Pete</p>
    <p>Sam­pras, Michael Jor­dan, Michael Schu­macher in the 1990s. Jesse Owens, Joe Louis and Sonja He­nie, who was 10-time fig­ure skat­ing world champ, in the late 1920s to 1940s. Ev­ery time has its flavour.</p>
    <p>The lat­est gen­er­a­tion is usu­ally the tallest gen­er­a­tion be­cause it’s stand­ing on the shoul­ders of those be­fore them. Mar­garet Court is Serena’s tar­get. Mark Spitz was hunted by Phelps. Stars set the bar for the fu­ture by chas­ing the past.</p>
    <p>Ex­cel­lence evolves as the pool of tal­ent widens. At the 1912</p>
    <p>Olympics there were 28 na­tions, a cen­tury later in Lon­don there were 204. As num­bers rise, com­pe­ti­tion sharp­ens. In 2000, only three swim­mers timed 22 sec­onds or un­der in the 50m freestyle; in 2019, it was done by over 30 men.</p>
    <p>Great­ness ar­rives from am­bi­tion but also re­sources. Faster is not just a skill but a pro­fes­sional at­ti­tude. Once, ath­letes could barely find funds to travel to an Olympics. Yet at the 2012 Games, wrote the Guardian, ev­ery medal won by Bri­tain cost an av­er­age of £4.5 mil­lion (S$8 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>Ev­ery era has new sci­ence at its beck and the lat­est tech­nol­ogy at its call. Com­put­ers spit out data and un­der­wa­ter cam­eras study tech­nique. Older ath­letes trav­elled alone, mod­ern ones with an en­tourage of chefs, psy­chol­o­gists and pets. The 1960s might be fun to visit, if noth­ing else be­cause it was a sim­pler time. There were no chairs at ten­nis changeover­s.</p>
    <p>This era has Fed­erer-Nadal, but the 1960s-70s had Ali-Fra­zier. You pick. Usain Bolt is un­com­mon, but what about Wilma Ru­dolph, po­lio vic­tim, one of 22 chil­dren, 100m world-record breaker, who went to sleep wait­ing for her Olympic fi­nal and re­fused to at­tend a com­ing-home pa­rade if it wasn’t racially in­te­grated?</p>
    <p>Ev­ery gen­er­a­tion greets its he­roes in the same way. Once In A Life­time Tal­ent, it is said. Will Never See The Likes of Her Again, it is stated. Mostly they’re wrong. Sam­pras’ record 14 Slams in 2002 looked im­preg­nable for decades, yet Fed­erer sur­passed it seven years later. But oc­ca­sion­ally an ath­lete is hard to over­take. Gi­a­como Agos­tini, who won 15 world ti­tles on his mo­tor­cy­cle and then cried for three days when he re­tired, is yet to be matched.</p>
    <p>Yes, he was from the 1960s.</p>
    <p>Why does that era beckon? Be­cause Pele’s Brazil was all hazy black-and-white film and who wouldn’t want to see them for real? Be­cause Abebe Bik­ila didn’t need fancy Nikes but won the 1960 Olympic marathon bare­foot.</p>
    <p>Be­cause it had char­ac­ters and wasn’t yet over­whelmed by mar­ket­ing. Re­porters and ath­letes went out for a beer. Ali picked up hitch­hik­ers for a chat. The air crack­led with aware­ness and re­bel­lion and it makes you think: Is the great­est gen­er­a­tion de­bate only about records?</p>
    <p>Sport then had a moral courage as ath­letes stood up for is­sues. Ali’s re­fusal to fight in Viet­nam meant a three-year ban; Tommy Smith and John Car­los’ protest against racism brought death threats; Kathrine Switzer de­fied sex­ism to be­come the first woman to run the Bos­ton Marathon as a reg­is­tered com­peti­tor; and King gave that old chau­vin­ist Bobby Riggs a beat­ing and a live pig.</p>
    <p>Your great-grand­child’s era will see as­ton­ish­ing progress, yet your grand­par­ents also lived in a unique time. A time of change that was hard-fought, painful and in­tox­i­cat­ing. A time full of “gi­ant leaps” made for hu­mankind. A year be­fore Neil Armstrong rock­eted into space in 1969, Bob Bea­mon leapt across it. In Mex­ico 1968, he broke the long jump world record by 55 ridicu­lous cen­time­tres.</p>
    <p>It was the 1960s. So, of course, the night be­fore his fi­nal he’d had a shot of tequila.</p>

Brazil ad&#xAD;vanced to the semi-fi&#xAD;nals with a 1-0 vic&#xAD;tory through Pele, then only 17. They also won the fi&#xAD;nal and re&#xAD;tained their ti&#xAD;tle in 1962.</p>
