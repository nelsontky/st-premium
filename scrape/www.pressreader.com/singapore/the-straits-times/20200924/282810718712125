    <p>• When Tai­wanese ac­tress Joe Chen an­nounced on so­cial me­dia last De­cem­ber that she was dat­ing Malaysian artist Alan Chen, many ne­ti­zens were scep­ti­cal about the re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>Chen, 41, had met Alan Chen, 32, on Chi­nese dat­ing re­al­ity pro­gramme Meet­ing Mr Right II last year, and fans were won­der­ing ini­tially if they were still put­ting on a show.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Joe Chen, who is known for act­ing in tele­vi­sion se­ri­als such as The Prince Who Turns Into A Frog (2005), Fated To Love You (2008) and Des­tined To Love You (2015), re­sponded on so­cial me­dia: “No scripts, no lines, love did not give up on me.”</p>
    <p>She added that she took part in Meet­ing Mr Right II not for the pay­ment, but to look for love.</p>
    <p>Fast for­ward to Tues­day and the cou­ple are cel­e­brat­ing the first an­niver­sary of their courtship.</p>
    <p>They had not seen each other for more than three months due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, so meet­ing up was es­pe­cially sweet.</p>
    <p>They posted videos and photos of their cel­e­bra­tion on so­cial me­dia late on Tues­day, as Joe Chen wrote in Chi­nese: “A year can be long, but it can be short too, and many changes can take place in a year. The world has changed, and many peo­ple have left us.</p>
    <p>“Time tells us to cher­ish the present, ev­ery ten­der mo­ment and ev­ery­one who loves us. For the peo­ple we love, thanks for the gains and losses.”</p>
    <p>Alan Chen wrote i n English: “Happy first an­niver­sary, baby. Re­ally grate­ful that we are able to be to­gether to mark this joy­ous mile­stone. Though we are un­able to re­visit Langkawi’s sky­bridge dur­ing this pan­demic.” It was where they of­fi­cially got to­gether.</p>
    <p>Joe Chen had pre­vi­ously dated Tai­wanese ac­tor Wal­lace Huo, who is now mar­ried to Tai­wanese ac­tress Ruby Lin.</p>
