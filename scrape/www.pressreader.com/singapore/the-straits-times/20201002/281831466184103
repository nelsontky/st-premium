    <p>In his speech, Mr Li Ke­qiang said China has achieved eco­nomic growth and made fur­ther progress in the bat­tle against poverty. “The Chi­nese econ­omy has shown strong re­silience,” Mr Li said. “We will nur­ture new driv­ers of growth,” he vowed.</p>
    <p>BEI­JING • The year 2020, trou­bled by the coro­n­avirus and the global eco­nomic re­ces­sion, is ex­tremely un­usual in the his­tory of China, said Chi­nese Premier Li Ke­qiang.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the coun­try has achieved ma­jor strate­gic re­sults in fight­ing the pan­demic by co­or­di­nat­ing epi­demic con­trols with eco­nomic and so­cial de­vel­op­ments, un­der the strong lead­er­ship of the Com­mu­nist Party of China Cen­tral Com­mit­tee with Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping at the core, Mr Li said at a re­cep­tion on Wed­nes­day night.</p>
    <p>These mea­sures were im­ple­mented with peo­ple’ s lives and health as the first pri­or­ity, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Li also high­lighted that China stands for the vi­sion to build a com­mu­nity with a shared fu­ture for mankind, and will work with the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity to con­trib­ute more to a vic­tory against Covid-19 and the re­cov­ery of the global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Held at the Great Hall of the Peo­ple in Bei­jing, the re­cep­tion was to cel­e­brate the 71st an­niver­sary of the found­ing of the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China on Oct 1. It was at­tended by Pres­i­dent Xi and other lead­ers: Mr Li Zhan­shu, Mr Wang Yang, Mr Wang Hun­ing, Mr Zhao Leji, Mr Han Zheng and Mr Wang Qis­han. About 500 guests from home and abroad were also present.</p>
    <p>In his speech, Mr Li Ke­qiang said China has achieved eco­nomic growth and made fur­ther progress in the bat­tle against poverty. “The Chi­nese econ­omy has shown strong re­silience,” Mr Li said. “We will nur­ture new driv­ers of growth,” he vowed.</p>
    <p>More job op­por­tu­ni­ties should be pro­vided by all pos­si­ble means, he said, adding that work must be done to ad­dress the peo­ple’s concerns in ed­u­ca­tion, med­i­cal ser­vices, elder­care and child­care, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>On Hong Kong, Mr Li said ef­forts are needed to “fully and faith­fully im­ple­ment the poli­cies of one coun­try, two sys­tems, the peo­ple of Hong Kong gov­ern­ing Hong Kong, and the peo­ple of Ma­cau gov­ern­ing Ma­cau, as well as a high de­gree of au­ton­omy for both re­gions”.</p>
    <p>There should be strict com­pli­ance with China’s Con­sti­tu­tion and the ba­sic laws of the two spe­cial ad­min­is­tra­tive re­gions, he said, call­ing for the im­prove­ment of the sys­tems and mech­a­nisms for en­forc­ing the Con­sti­tu­tion and the ba­sic laws.</p>
    <p>On Tai­wan, Mr Li urged for ef­forts to up­hold the one-China prin­ci­ple and the 1992 Con­sen­sus to firmly op­pose and de­ter any sep­a­ratist ac­tiv­i­ties and ex­ter­nal in­ter­fer­ence for “Tai­wan in­de­pen­dence”.</p>
    <p>Mr Li also called for the strength­en­ing of ex­change and co­op­er­a­tion across the Tai­wan Strait, pro­mot­ing peace­ful and in­te­grated de­vel­op­ment of cross-Strait re­la­tions, and ad­vanc­ing na­tional re­uni­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>China will stay on the path of peace­ful de­vel­op­ment, Mr Li stressed, not­ing that the coun­try will take res­o­lute mea­sures to safe­guard its sovereignt­y, se­cu­rity, and de­vel­op­ment in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day morn­ing, crowds of peo­ple wear­ing face masks and wav­ing mini China flags gath­ered on Tianan­men Square to cel­e­brate the na­tional day. At 6.01am, as the first rays of light pierced the morn­ing mist, a huge na­tional flag – es­corted by the Guard of Hon­our of the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army – was un­furled and hoisted while the na­tional an­them played.</p>
