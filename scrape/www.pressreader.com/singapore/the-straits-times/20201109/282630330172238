    <p>West Brom 0 Tot­ten­ham 1</p>
    <p>LONDON • With 260 goals, many con­sider Alan Shearer’s feat as the all-time record scorer in the Premier League to be un­touch­able.</p>
    <p>Harry Kane, how­ever, has time on his side and if the 27-year-old con­tin­ues his ex­ploits in front of goal, he has ev­ery chance of even­tu­ally pass­ing the New­cas­tle great.</p>
    <p>The Eng­land cap­tain nabbed his 150th Eng­lish top-flight goal in 218 games on Sun­day, head­ing home an 88th-minute win­ner as Tot­ten­ham beat West Brom 1-0 at the Hawthorns yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>His strike was per­fectly timed after Spurs had laboured to break down stub­born op­po­nents. And hav­ing scored his 200th goal in all com­pe­ti­tions for the club last</p>
    <p>Thurs­day, he now has 13 goals this sea­son.</p>
    <p>Kane is the first player born after the Premier League started in 1992 to score 150 times and in do­ing so, he broke out of a tie with for­mer Spurs for­ward Les Fer­di­nand to move to joint-ninth with for­mer Liver­pool for­ward Michael Owen on the all-time list.</p>
    <p>While Spurs were only mo­men­tar­ily top of the ta­ble for the first time since Au­gust 2014 be­fore Le­ices­ter’s vic­tory over Wolves later in the day, man­ager Jose</p>
    <p>Mour­inho told re­porters he was happy with his side’s progress amid talk of a ti­tle tilt.</p>
    <p>“If Liver­pool and Le­ices­ter win, it’s not a prob­lem for me,” he said. “So many good clubs .You can have a good sea­son and still not be cham­pi­ons. We’ll just try to win.</p>
    <p>“I’m not both­ered about Le­ices­ter v Wolves or (Manch­ester) City v Liver­pool. I just want us to win games and we’ll see where we are.</p>
    <p>“I would start with West Bromwich’s per­for­mance, be­cause their per­for­mance is what made us play in the way we did. They played de­fen­sively very well...</p>
    <p>“Let’s say that de­fen­sively, we con­trolled the game well, but we couldn’t find lots of spa­ces to play and cre­ate lots of chances. The goal ar­rived and I think de­servedly, but I have to feel sorry for them be­cause they fought so hard for the point.</p>
    <p>“I pre­fer not to speak (about Kane) be­cause he speaks by him­self... This guy does much more than scor­ing goals. For ex­am­ple, last five min­utes, he was play­ing as a No. 6 and win­ning balls in front of the de­fence. Spe­cial.”</p>
    <p>Only Shearer (212 games) and</p>
    <p>Ser­gio Aguero (217) have got­ten to 150 faster than Kane and the striker was just as happy as his man­ager with the “big win”.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously de­lighted to reach 150 Premier League goals,” he said. “Ob­vi­ously, when you win the game, that’s the most im­por­tant thing, we dug deep but let’s keep it go­ing.”</p>
    <p>Spurs are now un­beaten in their last seven league games and have won their past three, but were be­low their best for long pe­ri­ods against a West Brom team still with­out a league win this term.</p>
    <p>The hosts suf­fered a pre-match blow when de­fender Branislav Ivanovic and mid­fielder Matheus Pereira were ruled out after both tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>But amid reports that Charl­ton man­ager Lee Bowyer is be­ing lined up as a re­place­ment for Slaven Bilic, the West Brom boss said he saw enough from his play­ers to in­di­cate the Bag­gies will not make a swift re­turn to the Cham­pi­onship with­out a fight.</p>
    <p>“When I see my team fight­ing and play­ing, then I’m very, very pos­i­tive, the win will come,” he added.</p>
