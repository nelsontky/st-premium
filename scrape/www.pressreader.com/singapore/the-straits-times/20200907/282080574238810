    <p>While con­duct­ing field re­search and in­ter­act­ing with com­mu­nity lead­ers in Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia and In­done­sia, Dr Norshahril Saat of­ten has to pick up on nu­ances.</p>
    <p>A good com­mand of the Malay lan­guage, the lin­gua franca of South-east Asia, has helped him en­gage with the dif­fer­ent com­mu­ni­ties, said the 37-year-old.</p>
    <p>But there are still sub­tle dif­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>“Once, while speak­ing with a Ke­lan­tanese politi­cian, I took some time to digest and un­der­stand some words, and the same is true while con­duct­ing re­search in In­done­sia, as there may be In­done­sian terms that are thrown in. Ba­sic Malay still al­lows me to com­mu­ni­cate in these cases and learn new words along the way,” he said.</p>
    <p>The chair­man of the Malay Her­itage Foun­da­tion was wel­comed to the Duta Ba­hasa (lan­guage am­bas­sador) fra­ter­nity at the of­fi­cial launch of Bu­lan Ba­hasa (Malay Lan­guage Month), which aired on Sat­ur­day.</p>
    <p>The other new lan­guage am­bas­sadors are Dr Nur Farhan Alami, a Raf­fles Hos­pi­tal ge­ri­atric medicine spe­cial­ist, and Mr Su­jimy Mo­hamad, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of ScreenBox, an award-win­ning Sin­ga­pore-based dig­i­tal content cre­at­ing agency.</p>
    <p>Dr Norshahril, who con­ducts re­search in the ar­eas of pol­i­tics and po­lit­i­cal Is­lam in South-east Asia and has con­trib­uted ar­ti­cles to the Malay me­dia, said he will be cham­pi­oning the use and pro­mo­tion of the Malay lan­guage in his role as Duta Ba­hasa.</p>
    <p>“I have pledged my com­mit­ment to fos­ter­ing the lan­guage in the fu­ture. I want to en­gage young peo­ple, stu­dents in par­tic­u­lar, and share with them the importance of the Malay lan­guage,” he added.</p>
    <p>For the first time, Bu­lan Ba­hasa went on­line this year. It will run till Oct 11, with ac­tiv­i­ties con­ducted through on­line plat­forms such as Zoom and Face­book Live, in­clud­ing a lyric writ­ing work­shop and a con­tem­po­rary shadow pup­petry work­shop.</p>
    <p>Start­ing as a Malay Lan­guage Coun­cil bi­en­nial event in 1988, Bu­lan Ba­hasa has since 2011 be­come an an­nual cel­e­bra­tion fo­cused on en­cour­ag­ing the com­mu­nity to em­brace and use the Malay lan­guage in their daily lives.</p>
    <p>At the event launch on Me­di­a­corp’s Malay TV sta­tion Suria on Sat­ur­day night, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat, who was guest of hon­our, said he was heart</p>
    <p>ened to see the un­wa­ver­ing com­mit­ment from the com­mu­nity and its part­ners in pro­mot­ing the love and ap­pre­ci­a­tion for the lan­guage.</p>
    <p>“A good com­mand of the Malay lan­guage can open many doors for us and un­lock many op­por­tu­ni­ties in Sin­ga­pore and in South-east Asia,” he said.</p>
    <p>“En­abling Sin­ga­pore­ans to have a good com­mand of our mother tongue lan­guages is not easy, but when we suc­ceed, the re­sults will be very re­ward­ing,” added DPM Heng, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies and Fi­nance Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>He said he is also tak­ing Malay lan­guage classes and has been try­ing to im­prove his abil­ity to con­verse in Malay.</p>
    <p>“I hope I can com­mu­ni­cate bet­ter with all of you,” he told view­ers.</p>
    <p>Madam Ra­hayu Mahzam, chair­man of the Bu­lan Ba­hasa Com­mit­tee, noted the imag­i­na­tion and cre­ativ­ity be­hind each vir­tual event, say­ing these will be in­te­gral to its ef­forts in keep­ing the Malay lan­guage in­ter­est­ing and rel­e­vant for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>She also wel­comed the new lan­guage am­bas­sadors to the Duta Ba­hasa fra­ter­nity and said she looked for­ward to their con­tri­bu­tion and sup­port of the Malay lan­guage.</p>

    <p>REACH­ING OUT TO YOUTH</p>
    <p>I have pledged my com­mit­ment to fos­ter­ing the lan­guage in the fu­ture. I want to en­gage young peo­ple, stu­dents in par­tic­u­lar, and share with them the importance of the Malay lan­guage.</p>
    <p>DR NORSHAHRIL SAAT, chair­man of the Malay Her­itage Foun­da­tion, who was wel­comed to the Duta Ba­hasa fra­ter­nity.</p>
    <p>A CHAL­LENG­ING TASK</p>
    <p>En­abling Sin­ga­pore­ans to have a good com­mand of our mother tongue lan­guages is not easy, but when we suc­ceed, the re­sults will be very re­ward­ing.</p>
    <p>DEPUTY PRIME MIN­IS­TER HENG SWEE</p>
    <p>KEAT, who said he was heart­ened to see the un­wa­ver­ing com­mit­ment from the com­mu­nity and its part­ners in pro­mot­ing ap­pre­ci­a­tion for the Malay lan­guage.</p>
