    <p>KUALA LUMPUR Em­ploy­ers in Malaysia must pre­pare ad­e­quate hous­ing fa­cil­i­ties for their for­eign work­ers be­fore they would be al­lowed into the coun­try, a se­nior Cab­i­net min­is­ter said yes­ter­day in a get-tough move as the gov­ern­ment grap­ples with a surge in coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions in Se­lan­gor’s worker dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter (Se­cu­rity clus­ter) Is­mail Sabri Yaakob said em­ploy­ers must com­ply with the Work­ers’ Min­i­mum Stan­dards of Hous­ing and Ameni­ties Act 1990, called Act 446, and have th­ese ac­com­mo­da­tions ap­proved by the Hu­man Re­sources Min­istry be­fore they could im­port for­eign labour, with im­me­di­ate ef­fect.</p>
    <p>Em­ployer com­pli­ance with the Act has been spotty. But the gov­ern­ment is act­ing now amid alarm over the surge in Covid-19 cases in the past few weeks among mi­grant work­ers in Se­lan­gor who work for Top Glove, the world’s big­gest rub­ber glove maker.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore an em­ployer makes an ap­pli­ca­tion to bring in for­eign work­ers, the em­ployer must ob­tain the cer­tifi­cate from the Hu­man Re­sources Min­istry to en­able the Malaysian Im­mi­gra­tion Depart­ment to is­sue a visa,” Datuk Seri Is­mail told re­porters at a news con­fer­ence to dis­cuss worker hous­ing. Ber­nama news agency quoted him as say­ing: “This means, be­fore for­eign work­ers ar­rive in the coun­try, the em­ploy­ers are re­quired to make avail­able ac­com­mo­da­tion that com­plies with Act 446. Oth­er­wise, the for­eign work­ers are (re­garded as) il­le­gal im­mi­grants.”</p>
    <p>He said Act 446 not only in­volves ba­sic hous­ing for for­eign work­ers, but also that for lo­cal work­ers. “The fo­cus of Act 446 at the mo­ment is on for­eign work­ers due to the high num­ber of Covid-19 cases in­volv­ing them.”</p>
    <p>At the same con­fer­ence, Hu­man Re­sources Min­is­ter M. Sar­a­vanan said 1.4 mil­lion or 91.1 per cent of for­eign work­ers in Malaysia are pro­vided with ac­com­mo­da­tion be­low that stip­u­lated in Act 446.</p>
    <p>He also said that though there are 1.6 mil­lion le­gal mi­grant labour in the coun­try, “the gov­ern­ment re­ceived ap­pli­ca­tions for Cer­tifi­cate of Ac­com­mo­da­tion for only 143,587 or 8.89 per cent” of them by end-Oc­to­ber, Ber­nama re­ported.</p>
    <p>Malaysia said on Tues­day that it had opened an in­ves­ti­ga­tion and would take le­gal ac­tion against Top Glove as it did not com­ply with the ba­sic re­quire­ments for worker hous­ing.</p>
