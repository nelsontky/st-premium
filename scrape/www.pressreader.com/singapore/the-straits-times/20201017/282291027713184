    <p>RACE 1 (2,000M)</p>
    <p>7 For­tune Pa­trol has been cry­ing out for a trip. He should rel­ish the step- up to 2,000m.</p>
    <p>6 En­joy­able Suc­cess missed by a short head at his third run last cam­paign. He should go close again.</p>
    <p>2 Hay Run is solid on his day. The in­side gate should al­low him to sit promi­nently and get ev­ery chance. 10 Proud Sky gets in light. He is ca­pa­ble of putting up a good show.</p>
    <p>RACE 2 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>14 Copart­ner Era slots in light. His sec­ond-up run, when a close fifth over this course and dis­tance, was eye-catch­ing. Joao Mor­eira takes over and he looks hard to beat.</p>
    <p>1 Merry gowin’s last run in Class 4 re­sulted in a win. With cham­pion jockey Zac Pur­ton up, there is a chance of him fir­ing first-up. 7 All Joy­ful has the wide gate to con­tend with, but has shown glimpses of abil­ity in his three-start ca­reer.</p>
    <p>13 Won­der Ex­press slots in light. He gets the ser­vices of the in-form Alexis Badel.</p>
    <p>RACE 3 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>GROUP 2 PRE­MIER BOWL</p>
    <p>1 Hot King Prawn has the class. He ap­pears ready on his lat­est trial. He is drawn to get the right run and should han­dle the top weight.</p>
    <p>7 Per­fect Match has gone from strength to strength since the start of last sea­son. He has four wins from seven runs, in­clud­ing a good Class 1 win first-up this term.</p>
    <p>2 Voy­age War­rior is a Group 2 win­ner. He is lightly raced and looked well in his re­cent bar­rier trial.</p>
    <p>6 Com­puter Patch bagged the Group 3 Na­tional Day Cup with ease, al­beit against a rel­a­tively weak field. He prob­a­bly needs to step it up against this lot.</p>
    <p>RACE 4 (1,600M)</p>
    <p>4 Meth­ane ap­pears to have pro­gressed between sea­sons, based on his lat­est trial. He looks wound up to fire upon re­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>2 Ezra should rel­ish the step-up to 1,600m, based on his first-up fourth over 1,400m.</p>
    <p>1 De­ci­sive Ac­tion ran a poor race first-up. But, with Pur­ton tak­ing charge, he bears watch­ing.</p>
    <p>12 Bul­let­proof has abil­ity. He is ca­pa­ble of scoring any time.</p>
    <p>RACE 5 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>8 Win­ning Steed has abil­ity. He can atone for his first-up struggling per­for­mance with the right run.</p>
    <p>6 Red Majesty has im­pressed in the lead-up for his de­but. He looks to have a rea­son­ably bright fu­ture.</p>
    <p>5 Cheer­ful Days is in a sim­i­lar boat, hav­ing put to­gether a num­ber of im­pres­sive tri­als.</p>
    <p>7 Sparky Star is lightly raced. He has drawn well and should get ev­ery op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>RACE 6 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>9 Res­o­lute has abil­ity. He ap­peared to be fi­nally piec­ing it to­gether at the end of last sea­son with a last­start third. This is a suit­able first-up out­ing.</p>
    <p>10 Star Su­pe­rior has the runs on the board. If he can over­come the wide gate, he is a chance.</p>
    <p>1 For­tune Hap­pi­ness has done well in both runs this term. This is a dif­fi­cult con­test, but he has the class fac­tor.</p>
    <p>11 Su­per Kin is bet­ter than his record sug­gests. He has the in­side gate, which suits, and also a light weight on his back.</p>
    <p>RACE 7 (1,600M)</p>
    <p>GROUP 2 ORI­EN­TAL WATCH SHA TIN TRO­PHY</p>
    <p>4 Golden Sixty was sim­ply bril­liant first-up, claim­ing a num­ber of high­pro­file scalps. He is ca­pa­ble of cap­tur­ing his ninth con­sec­u­tive win.</p>
    <p>1 Beauty Gen­er­a­tion was cramped for room in the straight last start. But he man­aged to do well to dead­heat for sec­ond with Cham­pion’s Way. He is drawn well and should be chal­leng­ing for the win.</p>
    <p>6 Dances With Dragon should rel­ish the ex­tra 200m.</p>
    <p>5 Furore is next best, af­ter his short stint at Conghua.</p>
    <p>RACE 8 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>8 Sunny Boy is a classy in­di­vid­ual on his day. From the good gate, he can run them along from the front and might just pinch it.</p>
    <p>2 Red Desert is look­ing for back-to­back wins on the dirt. He has a favourable draw. He also ap­pears to have a num­ber of rat­ings points in hand.</p>
    <p>4 Will Power is a dirt spe­cial­ist who re­cap­tured his blis­ter­ing best with a win last start. This is much more dif­fi­cult and he will need luck to win, es­pe­cially from Gate 12.</p>
    <p>7 Ugly War­rior loves the dirt and gets the favourable book­ing of Mor­eira. He can fig­ure if he can bring back his best.</p>
    <p>RACE 9 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>3 Win­ning Dreamer is search­ing for his fourth straight win. He is a classy prospect.</p>
    <p>10 Scores Of Fun is also un­beaten. He recorded a tough, weav­ing win last time for Mor­eira. He is the main dan­ger.</p>
    <p>6 Chicken Dance re­turned in fine form first-up from in­jury. He ap­pears ready to take another step for­ward.</p>
    <p>5 Awe is next best.</p>
    <p>RACE 10 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>14 Charizard races well fresh. With the right run, he can win what looks like a dif­fi­cult race. This is his pre­ferred course and dis­tance.</p>
    <p>7 Mar­vel Dragon is the likely leader. He should get an ideal run from Gate 1 which could see him prove dif­fi­cult to reel in.</p>
    <p>5 The Hulk is still on the up. His first-up run holds him i n good stead. He has drawn well, too.</p>
    <p>8 Pres­i­dent’s Choice is just a small horse, but he does have a big heart.</p>
