    <p>There is one com­pelling rea­son to con­sider the Hyundai Kona Hy­brid and it has noth­ing to do with the in­her­ent ef­fi­ciency of hy­brids.</p>
    <p>Do not get me wrong. The Kona Hy­brid makes a good case for sav­ing the earth. It has a rated fuel econ­omy of 4.3 litres/100km (5.9 litres in real life) – ver­sus 6.7 litres/100km for its 1.6-litre tur­bocharged twin.</p>
    <p>Even if you are not a tree hug­ger, the su­pe­rior ef­fi­ciency trans­lates to a tan­gi­ble gain – fuel bill savings of about $10,000 over 10 years. That is no small change.</p>
    <p>I also get a kick out of max­imis­ing the dis­tance I can clock on a full tank. In the case of the Kona Hy­brid, its fuel gauge moved only a notch af­ter 200km.</p>
    <p>The Hyundai may not be as fru­gal as the Toy­ota Prius – ar­guably the king of ef­fi­ciency – but it is a lot more fun to drive. Which brings me to the non-ef­fi­ciency rea­son for con­sid­er­ing it.</p>
    <p>The car may not have as much power as the 1.6-litre turbo Kona re­viewed here two years ago, but it is sur­pris­ingly nippy. This has largely to do with it hav­ing 265Nm of torque from 1,500rpm – the same as what the turbo puts out.</p>
    <p>While its nor­mally as­pi­rated 1,580cc en­gine (ver­sus the turbo’s slightly more re­fined 1,591cc) has a mod­est out­put of 105hp and 147Nm, it is paired with a 32kW elec­tric mo­tor, which pro­duces 170Nm of in­stant torque.</p>
    <p>To­gether, they de­liver 130hp and 265Nm to the front axle. And for a place like Sin­ga­pore, it is low-end torque which en­sures day-to-day drive­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>If you put pedal to the metal, though, the Kona Hy­brid lags be­hind its turbo twin. It takes 11.6 sec­onds to reach 100kmh and then onto a peak ve­loc­ity of 160kmh. The turbo – which has a seven-speed dual-clutch trans­mis­sion ver­sus the Hy­brid’s six-speeder – clocks a 7.9-sec­ond cen­tury sprint and maxes out at 205kmh.</p>
    <p>But for ev­ery­day driv­ing, there are few dis­cernible dif­fer­ences be­tween the two.</p>
    <p>In fact, I was ex­pect­ing the Kona to come across as anaemic on the back of the 400hp Land Rover De­fender, which is also re­viewed this week (see C8). Sur­pris­ingly, the Hyundai ac­quits it­self rather well.</p>
    <p>Part of its easy-to-live-with propo­si­tion has to do with its suite of driv­ing aids. For a car in its price range, the Kona Hy­brid is hard to beat in the fea­tures depart­ment.</p>
    <p>There is adap­tive cruise con­trol with lane guid­ance. Ac­ti­vate it and you can drive the car with min­i­mal steer­ing in­put (in prac­tice, you can do this only on straight roads). You can even se­lect the sys­tem’s re­spon­sive­ness level.</p>
    <p>The car is ex­tremely nim­ble, with a tight turn­ing cir­cle and a steer­ing which re­quires only 21/ turns to go</p>
    <p>2 from lock to lock.</p>
    <p>Other fea­tures in­clude blindspot warn­ing, driver alert warn­ing, rear cross traf­fic alert, col­li­sion avoid­ance, hill-start as­sist, down­hill brake con­trol, elec­tronic park­ing brake with auto hold func­tion, as well as a 7-inch in­fo­tain­ment sys­tem with Ap­ple CarPlay and An­droid Auto.</p>
    <p>All these com­bine to make the car more than an ef­fi­ciency champ – and a more com­pet­i­tive con­tender.</p>
