    <p>Vesta Gul, 72, is walk­ing her dog in the woods when she finds a hand­writ­ten note on the ground.</p>
    <p>“Her name was Magda. No­body will ever know who killed her. It wasn’t me. Here is her dead body.”</p>
    <p>Gul (pro­nounced “gull”, like the bird) is re­cently wid­owed and new to the sleepy town of Le­vant in the United States. She picks up the note, and quickly be­comes ob­sessed with Magda and the mys­tery of her death.</p>
    <p>Death In Her Hands bears the usual hall­marks of Ottessa Mosh­fegh’s writ­ing. Misan­thropic nar­ra­tor? Check. Black hu­mour? Check. Sharp, caus­tic prose that cuts through the char­ac­ter’s men­tal fog? Def­i­nitely.</p>
    <p>The nar­ra­tor is a sep­tu­a­ge­nar­ian, but in her voice are echoes of Mosh­fegh’s other char­ac­ters – such as the world-weary grad­u­ate of My Year Of Rest And Re­lax­ation (2018) and the glum prison sec­re­tary of Eileen (2015), which was nom­i­nated for the Man Booker prize.</p>
    <p>Mosh­fegh’s lat­est novel is less provoca­tive than her ear­lier ones.</p>
    <p>Yet there is some­thing oddly com­pelling about its ex­plo­ration of loss and lone­li­ness.</p>
    <p>Vesta swad­dles her­self i n the com­forts of the imag­i­na­tion, mak­ing for an un­re­li­able nar­ra­tor whose mind is a Swiss cheese-like land­scape where re­al­ity and fan­tasy are of­ten con­fused.</p>
    <p>She even in­vents a back­story for the de­ceased hero­ine. Magda, she fan­cies, must have been a Be­laru­sian who worked as a fast-food worker and home aide in Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>The nar­ra­tor goes on to pop­u­late the story with love in­ter­ests for Magda and other char­ac­ters who seem to have been drawn, in the man­ner of free as­so­ci­a­tion, from real life.</p>
    <p>One of the most de­light­ful things about Mosh­fegh is her wicked hu­mour, though there are mo­ments when the nar­ra­tor in­dulges a bit too hap­pily i n her own mean­ness. Vesta, sketch­ing Magda’s per­son­al­ity, at one point imag­ines the young woman uri­nat­ing into a bucket and dip­ping some­one’s tooth­brush in it.</p>
    <p>“A flake of ex­cre­ment nes­tled be­tween the bris­tles. Ha ha! I nearly laughed, pic­tur­ing the kind of silly re­venge she might think up. That was pretty wretched. Where did she get that at­ti­tude? Per­haps she’d had a father who liked to make nasty jokes.”</p>
    <p>But at its best, the novel treads the fine line be­tween sav­agery and vul­ner­a­bil­ity, and does a good job at ex­plor­ing how one can love some­one but also re­sent them.</p>
    <p>There is no grand de­noue­ment. As it turns out, Vesta is not so much solv­ing a mur­der as plot­ting one. “How do you mur­der the dead?” is the real ques­tion that drives Death In Her Hands to­wards its cathar­tic, be­wil­der­ing con­clu­sion.</p>
    <p>If you like this, read: My Year Of Rest And Re­lax­ation ($18.73, Pen­guin, 2018, avail­able at bit.ly/MyYearRR_OM), Mosh­fegh’s novel about a grad­u­ate who es­capes from re­al­ity through drug-in­duced sleep.</p>
