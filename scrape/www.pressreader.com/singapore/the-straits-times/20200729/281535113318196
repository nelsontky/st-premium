    <p>In­done­sia, which has the high­est num­ber of uni­corns in South-east Asia, is keen to have th­ese start-ups listed on the coun­try’s stock ex­change, and hopes to see mil­len­ni­als come in as in­vestors of the com­pa­nies whose apps they use daily, a top bourse of­fi­cial has said.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia, which has the high­est num­ber of uni­corns in South-east Asia, is keen to have th­ese start-ups listed on the coun­try’s stock ex­change, and hopes to see mil­len­ni­als come in as in­vestors of the com­pa­nies whose apps they use daily, a top bourse of­fi­cial has said.</p>
    <p>A uni­corn is a start-up with a value ex­ceed­ing US$1 bil­lion (S$1.38 bil­lion). The six In­done­si­abased uni­corns are ride-hail­ing gi­ant Go­jek, e-com­merce plat­forms Toko­pe­dia, Bukala­pak and JD.id, air­line tick­et­ing and ho­tel book­ing com­pany Traveloka, and e-money com­pany Ovo.</p>
    <p>The In­done­sia Stock Ex­change (IDX) also wants to start at­tract­ing other start-ups with lower val­u­a­tion, said Mr Pandu Sjahrir, a newly ap­pointed board mem­ber of the IDX, on July 21.</p>
    <p>Those that still in­cur losses but have bright prospec­tive out­looks are now al­lowed to list their shares on the ex­change and are placed on the so-called “ac­cel­er­a­tion” board.</p>
    <p>“We kind of have to hunt for ele­phants. We have to be able to track them, to go and see and sell on the idea why IDX is very good for them to fund raise,” Mr Pandu said in a we­bi­nar or­gan­ised by the Jakarta For­eign Cor­re­spon­dent Club (JFCC).</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to a query from The Straits Times on the out­look for ini­tial public of­fer­ing (IPO) ac­tiv­i­ties, Mr Pandu said: “If you com­pare us to prob­a­bly large mar­kets like China or the US, the top 10 listed com­pa­nies are all tech­nol­ogy (re­lated).</p>
    <p>“In­done­sia is a bit dif­fer­ent. In the last 10 years, the top 10 com­pa­nies re­ally haven’t changed in terms of mix. It is still pre­dom­i­nantly led by banks, fi­nan­cial com­pa­nies, and also led by the tra­di­tional con­glom­er­ates.”</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus out­break has prompted an ir­re­versible trend of peo­ple mov­ing to or­der items and services on­line.</p>
    <p>Many have re­sorted to us­ing mo­bile apps pro­vided by Jakarta-based Toko­pe­dia and Bukala­pak to shop, and ride-hail­ing and food-de­liv­ery apps such as Go­jek and Sin­ga­pore­based Grab.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia had 22 com­pa­nies plan­ning IPOs at the end of last month – the largest in terms of the num­ber of IPO deals in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>By to­tal value of their pro­ceeds in ru­piah, the num­ber was quite low com­pared with last year when the IDX had 55 IPO deals. Be­fore the coro­n­avirus out­break ear­lier this year, the ex­change had 28 com­pa­nies lining up to list.</p>
    <p>The to­tal value was also lower com­pared with IPO deals in other South-east Asian coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The IDX’s to­tal mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion grew to 7,265 tril­lion ru­piah (S$690 bil­lion) last year from 7,023 tril­lion ru­piah in the year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>But the Covid-19 pan­demic has bat­tered the mar­ket, with mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion de­clin­ing to about 5,900 tril­lion ru­piah cur­rently.</p>
    <p>Asked about the prob­a­bil­ity of a Toko­pe­dia list­ing, vice-pres­i­dent of cor­po­rate fi­nance and in­vest­ments</p>
    <p>Randall Aluwi said in a sep­a­rate we­bi­nar or­gan­ised by JFCC ear­lier this year: “When we think about IPO, it is some­thing of a pos­i­tive devel­op­ment be­cause it also sig­ni­fies the scale we have achieved and also the ma­tu­rity level that we have achieved as a com­pany. That is def­i­nitely some­thing we as­pire to do in the near fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>In the same we­bi­nar ear­lier this year, Mr Teddy Oe­tomo, Bukala­pak’s chief strat­egy of­fi­cer, said that the com­pany wants to get into a stage where it is IPO-ready, but that does not mean it wanted to do an IPO right away.</p>
    <p>“The an­swer is yes and no. It is not some­thing that we will have to do, but we want to be, as soon as pos­si­ble, in the position that is IPOready, that is, prof­itable, right gov­er­nance, right au­di­tor, right ev­ery­thing, fi­nan­cial re­port­ing. That is more im­por­tant (than) whether you go (for an) IPO or not,” Mr Teddy said.</p>
    <p>Bukala­pak is, among oth­ers, backed by China’s Ant Fi­nan­cial and Sin­ga­pore sovereign wealth fund GIC, while Soft­bank Vi­sion Fund and Alibaba Group Holding are among Toko­pe­dia’s main back­ers.</p>
    <p>Said IDX’s Mr Pandu: “The good thing about those that have uni­corn ‘val­u­a­tion’, there has been a strong sense of in­sti­tu­tional in­vestors ei­ther from lo­cal or from for­eign.”</p>
    <p>He said he would also tar­get In­done­sian mil­len­ni­als, as many of them check the apps of th­ese uni­corns as soon as they wake up.</p>
    <p>Toko­pe­dia and Bukala­pak are be­lieved to have cur­rent val­u­a­tion of between US$5 bil­lion and US$7 bil­lion each, while the largest uni­corn in In­done­sia, Go­jek, is val­ued at about US$12 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>On the pos­si­bil­ity of any start-up, or com­pany that is in­cur­ring losses, want­ing to do an IPO, Mr Pandu said the ex­change would now ac­com­mo­date those com­pa­nies too.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, only com­pa­nies that had booked net prof­its for two con­sec­u­tive years were al­lowed to go for a list­ing.</p>
    <p>“We’re chang­ing that mind­set. We should not just look at the past. A lot of th­ese busi­nesses, es­pe­cially tech com­pa­nies, they look at the fu­ture,” Mr Pandu said.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple buy busi­nesses in the cap­i­tal mar­ket to buy po­ten­tial out­comes; to buy the po­ten­tial like­li­hood of com­pa­nies to suc­ceed.”</p>
