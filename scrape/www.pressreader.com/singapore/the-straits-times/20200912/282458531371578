    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Ten days af­ter root­ing for her brother to make a Grand Slam break­through, Nelly Korda is on course for a Ma­jor mile­stone of her own.</p>
    <p>She closed with a five-foot birdie putt to fire a six-un­der 66 and seize a one-stroke lead af­ter Thurs­day’s open­ing round of the ANA In­spi­ra­tion. The 22-year-old Amer­i­can went one stroke un­der her pre­vi­ous best round at Mission Hills Coun­try Club in California.</p>
    <p>She cred­ited her success in the sec­ond Ma­jor of a Covid-19 dis­rupted sea­son to more putting work and her fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Her fa­ther Petr, the 1998 Aus­tralian Open cham­pion, and her mother pro­vided much sup­port, just as they did for her brother Se­bas­tian when they were in New York to watch him make his US Open de­but, though he lost in the first round to De­nis Shapo­valov. Korda caught the tennis match on TV.</p>
    <p>“It’s re­ally nice ac­tu­ally,” she said of her par­ents’ pres­ence.</p>
    <p>“It’s nice to get some clap­ping oc­ca­sion­ally. Yeah, they’re def­i­nitely our big­gest fans, and we wouldn’t be where we are with­out them, so it’s su­per nice.”</p>
    <p>Her elder sis­ter Jes­sica, also seek­ing a first Ma­jor ti­tle, shot a 74.</p>
    <p>The younger Korda opened with birdies at the first and third holes be­fore tak­ing her lone bo­gey at the fourth. She birdied the sev­enth, the par-five ninth and par-five 11th as well be­fore clos­ing with birdies at the 16th and par-five 18th.</p>
    <p>South Korean Chun In-gee, whose Ma­jor ti­tles in­clude the 2015 US Women’s Open and 2016 Evian Cham­pi­onship, and Swe­den’s Made­lene Sagstrom, whose only win came in Jan­uary at Boca Rio, were sec­ond on 67.</p>
    <p>Korda, whose best show­ing here is a share of 13th, said hot sum­mer desert con­di­tions had made the course dif­fer­ent from its usual April set-up but no less for­mi­da­ble.</p>
    <p>“It’s very firm out here. Very dif­fer­ent,” said the world No. 3. “It’s like a dif­fer­ent mon­ster ac­tu­ally.”</p>
    <p>A pack on 68 in­cluded Malaysia’s Kelly Tan, Amer­i­can Danielle Kang, Canada’s Brooke Henderson and China’s Liu Yu.</p>
    <p>World No. 2 Kang, who won the LPGA’s first two re­turn events last month, closed with a birdie.</p>
    <p>“It’s more so just hav­ing the con­fi­dence in my golf game, hav­ing the be­lief I can pull off the shots,” she said. “I made some good putts.”</p>
