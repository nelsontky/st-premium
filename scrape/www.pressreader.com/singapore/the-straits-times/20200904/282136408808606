    <p>DON’T LOSE FAITH IN ED­U­CA­TORS</p>
    <p>One of the main tenets in the coun­selling process is to main­tain con­fi­den­tial­ity and, in the process, make a con­nec­tion with one’s clients (Ban ed­u­ca­tors from hav­ing closed-door ses­sions with kids, Sept 1).</p>
    <p>To have an­other per­son present means con­fi­den­tial­ity is com­pro­mised and chil­dren would feel un­com­fort­able shar­ing their is­sues with an­other per­son in the room.</p>
    <p>The child may not be willing to dis­close much and this will ham­per the coun­selling process. There should be greater trust in our ed­u­ca­tors and coun­sel­lors, and a strong be­lief that they are pro­fes­sion­als. A very small num­ber of re­cal­ci­trant of­fi­cers can­not mean that all ed­u­ca­tors and coun­sel­lors have failed in their duty.</p>

    <p>NOT A MAT­TER FOR PAR­LIA­MENT</p>
    <p>Work­ers’ Party MP Den­nis Tan re­counted in­stances of mis­chief pur­port­edly com­mit­ted by ac­tivists of the rul­ing party’s can­di­date over cam­paign para­pher­na­lia in his Hougang sin­gle-mem­ber con­stituency dur­ing the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion. The con­clu­sions he came to and al­le­ga­tions made were based on hearsay from some res­i­dents in the area.</p>
    <p>This is un­fair to the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party can­di­date and the sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>The proper author­ity to han­dle such mis­chief cases is the po­lice. This is not a mat­ter to be raised in Par­lia­ment.</p>

    <p>EX­TEND DU­RA­TION OF TRAIN­ING FUND</p>
    <p>I urge the Govern­ment to con­sider ex­tend­ing the train­ing al­lowance scheme for the self-em­ployed till June or even De­cem­ber next year. It is presently sched­uled to ex­pire by the end of this De­cem­ber, even though claims will still be al­lowed un­til Feb 28 next year.</p>
    <p>The train­ing al­lowance goes a long way in help­ing to de­fray the cost of skills up­grad­ing or up­skilling.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of the strong de­sire by many to up­grade, quite a num­ber of the cour­ses are fully booked till the end of the year. An ex­ten­sion of the scheme will give many more a chance to up­grade them­selves.</p>
    <p>Al­bert Tan Tiong Heng ’’</p>
