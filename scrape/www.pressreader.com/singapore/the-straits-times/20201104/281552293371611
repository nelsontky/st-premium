    <p>Land­mark mea­sures to help smaller busi­nesses exit con­tracts to cope with the fall­out from Covid-19 and pivot to new sec­tors were en­dorsed by MPs yes­ter­day. Un­der the Re-Align Frame­work, own­ers of small firms with a sig­nif­i­cant fall in rev­enue since the pan­demic can rene­go­ti­ate cer­tain con­tracts.</p>
    <p>Land­mark mea­sures to help smaller busi­nesses exit con­tracts to cope with the fall­out from Covid-19 and pivot to new sec­tors in a dif­fi­cult eco­nomic cli­mate were en­dorsed by MPs yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Re-Align Frame­work, own­ers of mi­cro and small busi­nesses with a sig­nif­i­cant fall in rev­enue since the pan­demic can rene­go­ti­ate cer­tain con­tracts.</p>
    <p>And if they can­not agree on new terms, they can ter­mi­nate these con­tracts early with­out penalty.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Law Ed­win Tong told Par­lia­ment the lat­est mea­sures are a needed re­sponse to a “once-in-a-life­time event of un­prece­dented pro­por­tions”.</p>
    <p>They should be seen as com­ple­men­tary to ex­ist­ing gov­ern­ment sup­port schemes, he said, adding that the Re-Align Frame­work will en­sure “the cash in­fu­sions are not drained away be­cause busi­nesses are stuck in their con­tracts”.</p>
    <p>“It will help sub­stan­tially im­pacted busi­nesses to avoid pro­tracted dis­putes, re­strate­gise and, in DPM’s words, to re­ju­ve­nate,” he said, re­fer­ring to Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat’s plans to re­ju­ve­nate the economy as Sin­ga­pore emerges from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Un­der another scheme, the Sim­pli­fied In­sol­vency Pro­gramme, mi­cro and small com­pa­nies in deeper fi­nan­cial dis­tress will also be able to re­struc­ture their debts or wind up quickly to max­imise re­turns to cred­i­tors and stake­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Mi­cro and small com­pa­nies are gen­er­ally de­fined as hav­ing an­nual rev­enue of less than $1 mil­lion and $10 mil­lion re­spec­tively, and ac­count for 95 per cent of firms here.</p>
    <p>The Re-Align Frame­work is part of changes to the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act, while the debt pro­gramme comes un­der the In­sol­vency, Re­struc­tur­ing and Dis­so­lu­tion Act.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment de­bated changes to both laws jointly yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong, who is also Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth, said the Re-Align Frame­work ad­heres to prin­ci­ples for the state to in­ter­vene in con­tracts, set out when the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act was in­tro­duced in April.</p>
    <p>The law pro­vided pro­tec­tion for in­di­vid­u­als and busi­nesses from le­gal and en­force­ment ac­tion for six months if they were un­able to ful­fil their con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions, to “hold the line” while the Gov­ern­ment tried to re­sus­ci­tate the economy, said the min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>In June, new leg­is­la­tion was in­tro­duced to help small and medi­um­sized en­ter­prises with their rentals, one of the big­gest cost pres­sures ten­ants face, he added.</p>
    <p>The lat­est changes, com­ing seven months after the law was first passed, are meant to help busi­nesses fo­cus on their re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>“They should be al­lo­cat­ing re­sources to more pro­duc­tive uses rather than be­ing stuck in a pro­longed, painful, un­pro­duc­tive strug­gle,” said the min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>But nei­ther does the Gov­ern­ment want to in­tro­duce more mea­sures that would keep oth­er­wise non-vi­able busi­nesses afloat.</p>
    <p>“That’s not go­ing to be vi­able in the long term. It ties up re­sources, man­power as well as as­sets,” he added. “The over­all mo­men­tum and di­rec­tion of these amend­ments is to take the economy, busi­nesses for­ward.”</p>
    <p>Ten MPs spoke dur­ing the de­bate. Mr Mu­rali Pil­lai (Bukit Ba­tok) and Mr Der­rick Goh (Nee Soon GRC) were among those who said the thresh­old for firms to qual­ify for the frame­work should not be set too high. The Law Min­istry will an­nounce details at a later date.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong said: “We will look as far as pos­si­ble at help­ing the ma­jor­ity of mi­cro and small busi­nesses.”</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment also ap­proved mea­sures to give con­trac­tors and prop­erty devel­op­ers four more months to com­plete and de­liver projects, while buy­ers will be able to seek re­im­burse­ment for out-of-pocket costs in­curred from the de­lays.</p>
    <p>Con­trac­tors will have to co-share half of ad­di­tional non-man­power costs with their sub­con­trac­tors and sup­pli­ers, sub­ject to caps.</p>
