    <p>POR­TI­MAO • Alex Al­bon has two races in which to demon­strate he de­serves to stay at Red Bull next year, team boss Chris­tian Horner said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing ahead of qual­i­fy­ing at the Por­tuguese Grand Prix, Horner said the team want the Lon­don­born Thai driver to prove they have no need to seek a re­place­ment.</p>
    <p>Red Bull plan to raise their chal­lenge next year, the l ast with Honda as en­gine sup­pli­ers, to chal­lenge Mercedes in the con­struc­tors’ and driv­ers’ cham­pi­onships.</p>
    <p>“He’s a pop­u­lar mem­ber of the team, but we need two cars closer to­gether in or­der to fight the Mercedes,” said Horner. “That’s what we’ve got to do, that’s our target.”</p>
    <p>Al­bon, 24, has strug­gled for con­sis­tency in his sec­ond year in For­mula One with Red Bull, af­ter a mid-sea­son switch from Toro Rosso last year, his rookie sea­son.</p>
    <p>“We want Alex to claim that seat and ba­si­cally jus­tify that there is no need to look at any other al­ter­na­tive than Alex,” added Horner.</p>
    <p>“He’s had a cou­ple of dif­fi­cult week­ends, so he needs to bounce back here I think and par­tic­u­larly at Imola with a strong week­end from start to fin­ish.”</p>
    <p>Al­bon has con­trib­uted 64 of the team’s to­tal of 211 points this year, with team­mate Max Ver­stap­pen out­do­ing him in qual­i­fy­ing and race per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>Horner said if the team felt his form to­day and at next week’s Emilia Ro­magna Grand Prix was be­low par, they would look be­yond the Red Bull sta­ble for a re­place­ment as sister team Al­phaTauri are “pretty set­tled with their driv­ers”.</p>
    <p>In qual­i­fy­ing yes­ter­day, Lewis Hamilton clinched pole for to­day’s race in which he is bid­ding for a record 92nd win. The Mercedes driver snatched pole in the dy­ing sec­onds from team­mate Valt­teri Bot­tas. It was his ninth pole of the sea­son and the 97th of his ca­reer.</p>
    <p>He said: “We’ve got a great car but you have to drive the nuts off of it to pull out a lap. Valt­teri’s been so quick this week­end, so I’ve just been dig­ging and dig­ging to find that ex­tra time.”</p>
    <p>Ver­stap­pen and Fer­rari’s Charles Le­clerc are in the sec­ond row, while Rac­ing Point’s Ser­gio Perez is fifth, along­side Al­bon in sixth.</p>
