    <p>UNITED KING­DOM</p>
    <p>After a spate of lo­cal lock­downs this month, Eng­land banned gath­er­ings of more than six peo­ple from yes­ter­day to stem the rise of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The move comes after a gov­ern­ment-backed sur­veil­lance project found that the in­fec­tion rate is ris­ing across all age groups, apart from those over 65, and cases are no longer clus­ter­ing in hos­pi­tals or care homes as they were a few months ago.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers at Im­pe­rial Col­lege Lon­don cal­cu­lated that the re­pro­duc­tion, or “R”, num­ber of Covid-19 in­fec­tions in Eng­land, which mea­sures how many peo­ple an in­fected per­son will pass the dis­ease to, is at 1.7, in­di­cat­ing that the epi­demic is grow­ing.</p>
    <p>“I think one would have to say that we are on the edge of los­ing con­trol,” Dr Mark Wal­port, the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment’s for­mer chief sci­en­tific ad­viser, told BBC ra­dio.</p>
    <p>AUS­TRIA</p>
    <p>Aus­trian Chan­cel­lor Se­bas­tian Kurz warned on Sun­day that the coun­try is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing “the be­gin­ning of the sec­ond wave” as new daily in­fec­tions climbed to­wards 1,000 cases.</p>
    <p>“We are go­ing to see 1,000 in­fec­tions soon. Fall and win­ter will be hard on ev­ery­body.”</p>
    <p>This comes as the Alpine na­tion of nearly nine mil­lion peo­ple re­ported 869 new cases – more than half of those in the cap­i­tal Vi­enna – from last Fri­day to Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Kurz said the gov­ern­ment would fur­ther re­strict events and ex­tend the ar­eas where maskwear­ing is manda­tory to in­clude all shops and pub­lic build­ings.</p>
    <p>FRANCE</p>
    <p>France re­ported 10,561 new coro­n­avirus cases last Satur­day, its high­est daily num­ber since widescale testing be­gan in the coun­try. Over the 24-hour pe­riod, 17 peo­ple died in hos­pi­tal, bring­ing the coun­try’s to­tal fa­tal­i­ties to 30,910.</p>
    <p>French lead­ers and health of­fi­cials have warned re­peat­edly that the virus is rag­ing, mainly among young peo­ple, but the coun­try did not im­pose any ma­jor new re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>CZECH REPUB­LIC</p>
    <p>The coun­try re­ported its big­gest one-day in­crease in new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions for a third straight day on Sun­day, record­ing 1,541 cases as the coun­try bat­tles a Covid-19 surge in re­cent weeks. It was the fifth day in a row with new in­fec­tions above 1,000 for the coun­try of 10.7 mil­lion after cases be­gan to ac­cel­er­ate last month.</p>
    <p>The spike prompted epi­demi­ol­o­gist Ro­man Pry­mula, the gov­ern­ment’s com­mis­sioner for sci­ence and re­search in health­care, to warn that a sec­ond wave had started and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions would soon rise.</p>
    <p>SPAIN POR­TU­GAL</p>
    <p>COPEN­HAGEN • The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) ex­pects Europe to see a rise in the daily num­ber of Covid-19 deaths in the next two months, the head of the body’s Euro­pean branch told Agence France-Presse yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“It is go­ing to get tougher. In Oc­to­ber, Novem­ber, we are go­ing to see more mor­tal­ity,” WHO Europe di­rec­tor Hans Kluge said, as the con­ti­nent cur­rently ex­pe­ri­ences a surge of cases though the num­ber of deaths has re­mained rel­a­tively sta­ble.</p>
    <p>The resur­gence is, how­ever, ex­pected to lead to an in­crease in daily deaths, the WHO said.</p>
    <p>Its com­ment comes as the num­ber of cases across Europe has risen sharply in re­cent weeks. More than 51,000 new cases were re­ported last Fri­day alone in the 55 coun­tries mon­i­tored by WHO Europe, which is more than the high­est peak in April, ac­cord­ing to the or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Here is the sit­u­a­tion in some Euro­pean coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Last week, Spain be­came the first western Euro­pean na­tion to record more than 500,000 cases since the be­gin­ning of the out­break. Re­cent in­fec­tions have been more com­mon among younger peo­ple who of­ten de­velop no symp­toms thanks to their stronger im­mune sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Spain has seen a surge in in­fec­tions since a strict three-month na­tional lock­down was lifted at the end of June, with Madrid fac­ing the brunt of this so-called sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>To curb in­fec­tions, the au­thor­i­ties have im­posed fresh re­stric­tions, or­der­ing the clo­sure of night­clubs and cock­tail bars last month and mak­ing the use of face masks manda­tory in pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Por­tu­gal re­ported 673 cases on Sun­day, bring­ing the to­tal to 63,983, the gov­ern­ment said. The coun­try has had more than 600 daily new con­firmed coro­n­avirus cases in three of the last five days, re­main­ing at a level last recorded in April. The num­ber of cases in in­ten­sive care units fell.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment an­nounced last week that from to­day, the limit on gath­er­ings in Por­tu­gal will be tight­ened to 10 peo­ple from 20, align­ing other re­gions with a rule that is al­ready in place for Lis­bon.</p>
