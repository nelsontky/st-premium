    <p>• Malaysia’s Health Min­istry has de­nied that it faked the num­ber of daily Covid-19 cases last Satur­day, which saw a record high of 1,228 be­ing re­ported.</p>
    <p>This was the first time the num­ber of daily cases breached the 1,000 mark in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“There were sev­eral fake mes­sages sent on What­sApp by ir­re­spon­si­ble par­ties. The min­istry would like to em­pha­sise that this state­ment is not true at all.</p>
    <p>“Please stop spread­ing fake news like this. The to­tal num­ber of cases re­ported on Oct 24, 2020, was 1,228 cases,” the min­istry said in a Face­book post on Sun­day night.</p>
    <p>The mes­sage claimed that the min­istry’s di­rec­tor­gen­eral (DG) Noor Hisham Ab­dul­lah was unhappy with in­struc­tions by Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin to fake the num­ber of cases.</p>
    <p>The mes­sage also said that the gov­ern­ment wanted to use the record fig­ure for in­fec­tions to push the case for declar­ing a state of emer­gency in the coun­try, thus sus­pend­ing Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>“Watch closely DG next move as he is likely to re­sign un­der pres­sure or pushed out of ac­tion by (Muhyid­din),” one mes­sage said, which likely orig­i­nated from a site de­scrib­ing it­self as a “so­cial news site”.</p>
    <p>The mes­sage was ac­com­pa­nied by a screenshot of a re­port on the can­cel­la­tion of the daily press con­fer­ence by Tan Sri Noor Hisham on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The health of­fi­cial him­self on Sun­day shared the screen­shots of the mes­sage on his Twit­ter ac­count, say­ing that fake news was a chal­lenge in the bat­tle against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>He said that he was un­able to hold the press con­fer­ence, but that a state­ment would be is­sued.</p>
    <p>“God will­ing, a press con­fer­ence will be held to­mor­row (Mon­day),” he added.</p>
    <p>At his news con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, he an­nounced that Malaysia has again hit a record high, with 1,240 new cases.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Muhyid­din last Fri­day re­quested the procla­ma­tion of a state of emer­gency to com­bat the threat of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He and sev­eral min­is­ters met the King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah, in Kuan­tan and pre­sented him with the plan to de­clare a state of emer­gency. They were ac­com­pa­nied by Dr Noor Hisham, In­spec­tor-Gen­eral of Po­lice Ab­dul Hamid Bador and At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Idrus Harun.</p>
    <p>But the King on Sun­day de­cided that there was no need to de­clare a state of emer­gency in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>He praised the Muhyid­din gov­ern­ment for its able han­dling of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>A state­ment from the palace said: “Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah feels that the cur­rent gov­ern­ment has been suc­cess­ful in han­dling the pan­demic ef­fec­tively.”</p>
