    <p>AT­LANTA • Mr Don­ald Trump’s cam­paign said it has filed a law­suit in Ge­or­gia state court seek­ing to in­val­i­date the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion re­sults there, the lat­est in a se­ries of le­gal chal­lenges aimed at re­vers­ing his loss that have so far failed.</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign said in a state­ment on Fri­day that its new law­suit would in­clude sworn state­ments from Ge­or­gia res­i­dents al­leg­ing fraud.</p>
    <p>Ge­or­gia’s Sec­re­tary of State Brad Raf­fensperger, a Repub­li­can, like Mr Trump, and other state of­fi­cials have said re­peat­edly they have found no ev­i­dence of widespread fraud in the Nov 3 elec­tion won by Demo­crat Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s team and var­i­ous in­di­vid­u­als back­ing him have suf­fered a string of l egal de­feats around the coun­try, in­clud­ing in cases filed in Nevada and Wis­con­sin that sought court or­ders to re­verse those states’ elec­tion re­sults.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent-elect Bi­den won the elec­tion with 306 elec­toral col­lege votes – against the 270 re­quired – to Mr Trump’s 232.</p>
    <p>The Wis­con­sin Supreme Court in a 4-3 de­ci­sion on Fri­day de­clined to act on a case that sought</p>
    <p>Left: Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence (at the lectern) drum­ming up sup­port for Mr David Per­due in Ge­or­gia, on Fri­day. Right: Democrats Jon Os­soff (left) and Raphael Warnock are locked in run-offs with Repub­li­can in­cum­bents Kelly Lo­ef­fler and David Per­due in the state.</p>
    <p>to have the court nul­lify the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in the state and pave the way for the state leg­is­la­ture to choose Wis­con­sin’s 10 pres­i­den­tial elec­tors. “Such a move would ap­pear to be un­prece­dented in Amer­i­can his­tory,” Wis­con­sin Supreme Court Jus­tice Brian Hage­dorn wrote.</p>
    <p>While Mr Trump keeps fight­ing the out­come of the elec­tion, some of the big­gest names in Amer­i­can pol­i­tics jumped into the fiercely con­tested run-offs for two Ge­or­gia</p>
    <p>Se­nate seats on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump was due to visit the state yes­ter­day to cam­paign for the two Repub­li­can in­cum­bents – David Per­due and Kelly Lo­ef­fler.</p>
    <p>Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence and for­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama held du­elling events to un­der­score the vi­tal stakes in the spe­cial Jan 5 elec­tion, which will de­ter­mine who con­trols the US Se­nate and, by ex­ten­sion, de­fine the early days of Mr Bi­den’s pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>Mr Obama ap­peared vir­tu­ally at</p>
    <p>a turn-out-the-vote event for Demo­crat Jon Os­soff, who is run­ning against Mr Per­due, and the Rev Raphael Warnock, Ms Lo­ef­fler’s op­po­nent.</p>
    <p>Mr Pence – with Mr Per­due and Ms Lo­ef­fler by his side – re­ceived a Covid-19 brief­ing at the At­lanta head­quar­ters of the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion and said later at a rally for the Repub­li­cans that “we’re go­ing to save the Se­nate, and then we’re go­ing to save Amer­ica”.</p>
