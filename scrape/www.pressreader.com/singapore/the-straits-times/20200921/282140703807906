    <p>A man was sen­tenced to three months’ jail last Thurs­day for forg­ing doc­u­ments to de­ceive the au­thor­i­ties into wrong­fully dis­burs­ing funds de­signed to help peo­ple af­fected by the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>Ed­ward Goh, 44, pleaded guilty in court to two counts of forgery for the pur­pose of cheat­ing.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments state that Goh forged two let­ters in May to cheat the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment (MSF) into dis­burs­ing the Covid-19 Sup­port Grant to his par­ents, Madam Tan Meng Lan and Mr Goh Keng Thow.</p>
    <p>The grant is meant to sup­port those who have lost their jobs and em­ploy­ees who have been placed on in­vol­un­tary no-pay leave or have had their salaries re­duced by at least 30 per cent for at least three con­sec­u­tive months. It pro­vides Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents with up to $800 a month for three months if they meet the job loss or no-pay leave cri­te­ria. Those who qual­ify based on their pay cut will re­ceive up to $500 a month for three months.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­cants also have to sub­mit sup­port­ing doc­u­ments prov­ing their el­i­gi­bil­ity, such as a re­trench­ment let­ter.</p>
    <p>On May 5, Goh forged a let­ter stat­ing that his mother had been re­trenched as a kitchen worker in the food­court at Ion Or­chard mall.</p>
    <p>Goh then at­tached the let­ter to the on­line ap­pli­ca­tion form, which stated that his mother lost her job on April 7, when she had in fact been re­trenched on May 4, said Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor Nicholas Lim.</p>
    <p>The DPP said she con­tin­ued to be paid for April and May, and was pro</p>
    <p>vided with an of­fi­cial re­trench­ment let­ter only around June 3.</p>
    <p>On May 14, Goh cre­ated a re­trench­ment memo pur­port­edly is­sued on March 1 by his fa­ther’s for­mer em­ployer, Ee Hui Food Cater­ing. It stated his fa­ther was no longer em­ployed by the com­pany then.</p>
    <p>DPP Lim said Goh, who was job­less when he com­mit­ted the of­fences, then sub­mit­ted his fa­ther’s ap­pli­ca­tion on­line with the forged memo at­tached.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the elder Mr Goh had stopped work­ing for Ee Hui on Feb 29, court doc­u­ments state.</p>
    <p>He had also sub­se­quently re­signed as a cook at a noo­dle stall owned by an­other com­pany and had not been re­trenched.</p>
    <p>Both forged doc­u­ments were later de­ter­mined to be fraud­u­lent by the MSF.</p>
    <p>While no money was dis­bursed to Madam Tan, $800 had al­ready been re­ceived by the elder Mr Goh. He has since re­turned the money.</p>
    <p>District Judge Tan Jen Tse granted Goh’s re­quest to de­fer his sen­tence un­til Sept 28, so that he can set­tle his per­sonal af­fairs.</p>
    <p>For each of­fence, Goh could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined.</p>
