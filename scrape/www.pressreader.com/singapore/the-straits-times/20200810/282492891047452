    <p>LON­DON • Red Bull’s Max Ver­stap­pen ended Mercedes’ per­fect start to this sea­son’s cam­paign with vic­tory at For­mula One’s 70th An­niver­sary Grand Prix at Sil­ver­stone.</p>
    <p>He fin­ished ahead of cham­pi­onship leader Lewis Hamil­ton and his Sil­ver Ar­rows team­mate Valt­teri Bot­tas, with Fer­rari’s Charles Le­clerc fourth and Alexan­der Al­bon of Red Bull com­plet­ing the top five yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This was Ver­stap­pen’s sev­enth podium fin­ish in eight races in a run, which also includes vic­tory in Brazil, start­ing from last year’s United States Grand Prix. It was also his ninth ca­reer GP win.</p>
    <p>Mercedes had won the first four races of this Covid-19 dis­rupted sea­son, but were left to rue a race and tyre strat­egy that al­lowed the Dutch­man, who started fourth on the grid, the chance to snatch the che­quered flag.</p>
    <p>His vic­tory was the re­sult of a team de­ci­sion to start the race on hard com­pound tyres, while their main ri­vals all launched from the grid on “medi­ums”, with the two Mercedes driv­ers strug­gling to man­age tyre-wear through­out the race.</p>
    <p>He said: “We had a lot of pace in the car. We kept push­ing. We had a great day, we had the right strat­egy. I tried to put the pressure on (Mercedes) and they had to pit.”</p>
    <p>“I didn’t see it com­ing, but af­ter the first stint, we seemed re­ally good on tyres and we didn’t have many tyre is­sues at all.</p>
    <p>“It is a great re­sult to win here and I am in­cred­i­bly happy.</p>
    <p>“We have not had an op­por­tu­nity to push them so far this sea­son. We need to use soft tyres that seems to suit our car.”</p>
    <p>For Mercedes, there was a sense of col­lec­tive dis­ap­point­ment even though Hamil­ton equalled Fer­rari great Michael Schu­macher’s record of 155 podium fin­ishes.</p>
    <p>Bot­tas said: “Very frus­trat­ing start­ing from pole and fin­ish­ing third. My strat­egy was far, far from ideal.</p>
    <p>“I was try­ing but as soon as I started to push at the end, the tyres fell apart.</p>
    <p>“As a team we were sleep­ing at some points, Red Bull’s strat­egy was far bet­ter and we have to look at this.</p>
    <p>“When you have those blis­ters, you lose cor­ner­ing grip. It is a dis­ap­point­ing day but we will move on.”</p>
    <p>Six-time world cham­pion Hamil­ton was equally an­noyed, say­ing: “Con­grat­u­la­tions to Red Bull and to Max. They didn’t have the blis­ter­ing prob­lems on the tyres that we had to­day.</p>
    <p>“It’s un­ex­pected but I’m sure the team will work out what the is­sues have been. At the end, I was driv­ing with half a tyre.</p>
    <p>“The team will be work­ing hard (to iden­tify the tyre prob­lems), Pirelli had tyre fail­ures last week, the pressure on them goes up and up and up – they’re like bal­loons.</p>
    <p>“I’m not sure any­one else strug­gled with blis­ter­ing like we did but we’ll look into it.</p>
    <p>“That mid­dle stint – even the first one, I started to fall back to­wards Max, I was man­ag­ing the tyres like you couldn’t be­lieve.</p>
    <p>“In the mid­dle stint, one half was bald and the other half was OK. I was afraid it was go­ing to ex­plode.”</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Racing Point owner Lawrence Stroll yes­ter­day an­grily ac­cused his F1 ri­vals of “un­sport­ing be­hav­iour”, re­ject­ing sug­ges­tions his team had cheated in de­sign­ing a car based on last year’s ti­tle-win­ning Mercedes.</p>
    <p>Fer­rari, McLaren, Re­nault and Wil­liams plan to ap­peal against a stew­ards’ de­ci­sion to fine the Cana­dian bil­lion­aire’s team €400,000 (S$647,000) and dock them 15 points in a row over copied parts.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Stroll in­sisted that Racing Point, whose RP20 car has been dubbed “the Pink Mercedes”, have not bro­ken any rules and will also be ap­peal­ing.</p>
    <p>“I do not of­ten speak pub­licly, how­ever, I am ex­tremely an­gry at any sug­ges­tion we have been un­der­hand or have cheated – par­tic­u­larly those com­ments com­ing from our com­peti­tors,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I have never cheated at any­thing in my life. Th­ese ac­cu­sa­tions are com­pletely un­ac­cept­able and not true.</p>
    <p>“My in­tegrity – and that of my team – are be­yond ques­tion.”</p>
