    <p>•</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines will have quick ac­cess to a Chi­nese coro­n­avirus vaccine. Latin Amer­i­can and Caribbean na­tions will re­ceive US$1 bil­lion (S$1.4 bil­lion) in loans to buy the medicine. Bangladesh will get more than 100,000 free doses from a Chi­nese com­pany.</p>
    <p>Never mind that China is still most likely months away from mass-pro­duc­ing a vaccine that is safe for pub­lic use. The coun­try is us­ing the prospect of the drug’s dis­cov­ery in a charm of­fen­sive aimed at re­pair­ing dam­aged ties and bring­ing friends closer in re­gions China deems vi­tal to its in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>Take, for ex­am­ple, In­done­sia, which has long been wary of Bei­jing. Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping as­sured his In­done­sia coun­ter­part Joko Wi­dodo, in a call two weeks ago, that “China takes se­ri­ously In­done­sia’s con­cerns and needs in vaccine co­op­er­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi hailed the two coun­tries’ co­op­er­a­tion on de­vel­op­ing a vaccine as “a new bright spot” in re­la­tions, ac­cord­ing to a state­ment from China’s For­eign Min­istry.</p>
    <p>“To­gether, China and In­done­sia will con­tinue to stand in sol­i­dar­ity against Covid-19,” Mr Xi said.</p>
    <p>China’s vaccine pledges, on top of ear­lier ship­ments of masks and ven­ti­la­tors around the world, help it project it­self as a re­spon­si­ble player as the United States re­treats from global lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing’s moves could also help it push back against ac­cu­sa­tions that the rul­ing Com­mu­nist Party should be held re­spon­si­ble for its ini­tial mis­steps when the coro­n­avirus first emerged in China in De­cem­ber. The abil­ity to develop and de­liver vac­cines to poorer coun­tries would also be a pow­er­ful sig­nal of China’s rise as a sci­en­tific leader in a new post-pan­demic global or­der.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple are very will­ing to take a Chi­nese vaccine,” said Ms Ghaz­ala Parveen, a se­nior of­fi­cial at the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Health in Pak­istan, where two Chi­nese vac­cin­e­mak­ers are con­duct­ing tri­als.</p>
    <p>“In fact, we are be­ing asked by peo­ple to have the vaccine ready as soon as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>By some mea­sures, China is lead­ing the global race for a Covid-19 vaccine. It has four can­di­dates in the last phase of clin­i­cal tri­als, more than any other coun­try.</p>
    <p>The US has three vaccine can­di­dates in late-stage tri­als, with</p>
    <p>Pfizer say­ing it could ap­ply for emer­gency ap­proval as early as next month and Moderna say­ing it hopes to have a vaccine by the end of the year. As­traZeneca, a Bri­tishSwedis­h com­pany that re­ceived US gov­ern­ment fund­ing to develop its vaccine, had to pause its late-stage global tri­als last week be­cause of a se­ri­ous sus­pected ad­verse re­ac­tion in a par­tic­i­pant.</p>
    <p>China has ap­proved at least two ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cines un­der an emer­gency use pro­gramme that started in July with sol­diers and em­ploy­ees of state-owned com­pa­nies and has qui­etly ex­panded to in­clude health­care and avi­a­tion work­ers. Its vaccine-mak­ers have built fac­to­ries that can pro­duce hun­dreds of thou­sands of doses.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi has de­clared that China would make do­mes­ti­cally de­vel­oped vac­cines a global pub­lic good, though his gov­ern­ment has pro­vided few de­tails.</p>
    <p>China has long viewed con­tribut­ing to global health as an op­por­tu­nity to build its soft power.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment def­i­nitely would like to see that China is suc­cess­ful in pro­duc­ing a good vaccine and that many coun­tries want it,” said Dr Jen­nifer Huang Bouey, an epi­demi­ol­o­gist and China ex­pert at the Rand Corp.</p>
    <p>“It’s ben­e­fi­cial for its diplo­macy and chang­ing the nar­ra­tive on Covid.”</p>
    <p>But Chi­nese vaccine com­pa­nies that have gone abroad to con­duct clin­i­cal tri­als have gen­er­ated con­tro­versy amid fears that lo­cal res­i­dents are be­ing treated like guinea pigs. And with so much still un­known about the coro­n­avirus, the vac­cines could make it to the last stage of tri­als only to stum­ble.</p>
    <p>De­spite the un­cer­tainty, Bei­jing has pushed its prospec­tive vac­cines with con­fi­dence and has used them to help smooth over fric­tions.</p>
    <p>In the Philip­pines, where China is com­pet­ing with the US for in­flu­ence, Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte told law­mak­ers in July that he had “made a plea” to Mr Xi for help with vac­cines. He also said he would not con­front China over its claims to the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>A day later, Mr Wang Wen­bin, a spokesman for China’s For­eign Min­istry, said Bei­jing was will­ing to give the Philip­pines pri­or­ity ac­cess to a vaccine.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese lead­ers have made similar of­fers to coun­tries in Africa, Latin Amer­ica, the Caribbean, the Mid­dle East and South Asia – re­gions where Bei­jing has sought to ex­pand its in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>Some po­lit­i­cal ex­perts in In­done­sia worry about the lever­age that China would wield over the coun­try, but they ac­knowl­edge that In­done­sia has lit­tle choice.</p>
    <p>“Should we be sus­pi­cious, or should we be grate­ful?” said Dr Muham­mad Zul­fikar Rakhmat, an aca­demic at Univer­si­tas Is­lam In­done­sia, who re­searches China’s for­eign pol­icy in In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>“I think both.”</p>
