    <p>A fire in a Bukit Ba­tok flat last year that led to the death of the home owner was caused by a per­sonal mo­bil­ity de­vice (PMD) that over­heated as it was be­ing charged, the coroner’s court heard yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times had ear­lier re­ported that pri­vate-hire driver Goh Keng Soon, 40, was un­con­scious when he was pulled out of his flat on July 18 last year.</p>
    <p>He died two days later. He is pos­si­bly the first per­son known to have died in a fire linked to a PMD.</p>
    <p>At an inquiry on his death, In­spec­tor Muham­mad Eszham Sabtu said Mr Goh, who suf­fered burns, died of mul­ti­ple or­gan fail­ure fol­low­ing a heart at­tack. He also had coro­nary artery dis­ease.</p>
    <p>The in­ves­ti­ga­tion of­fi­cer told State Coroner Ka­mala Pon­nam­palam that three PMDs were found in the liv­ing room, but only one was be­ing charged at the time.</p>
    <p>He also said that when the fire broke out, Mr Goh tried to save his two dogs, but ow­ing to the heat and smoke, he re­treated to a toi­let where he col­lapsed. Insp Eszham added that even though it was un­clear if Mr Goh had saved his pets, both dogs sur­vived the blaze.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor Huang Weikang from the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force (SCDF) told the state coroner three peo­ple were in­jured fol­low­ing the fire but only Mr Goh died. The other two were his wife and a neigh­bour.</p>
    <p>Maj Huang be­lieves the fire was ac­ci­den­tal and said that the liv­ing room fur­ni­ture fu­elled the flames.</p>
    <p>He said the path to safety for Mr Goh and his fam­ily might have been blocked as the burning PMD and sofa were near the front door.</p>
    <p>As a safety pre­cau­tion, he told the court that peo­ple should use only</p>
    <p>PMDs ap­proved by the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity, adding: “Don’t charge them overnight or (charge them) unat­tended.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore saw a record 102 fires in­volv­ing PMDs last year, al­most dou­ble that of the pre­vi­ous year.</p>
    <p>The SCDF had re­port­edly said all the fires in­volved non-UL2272-cer­ti­fied de­vices with some mod­i­fi­ca­tion, mainly to the bat­tery.</p>
    <p>The UL2272 re­quire­ment was de­vel­oped by an in­de­pen­dent United States cer­ti­fi­ca­tion com­pany.</p>
    <p>It spec­i­fies a set of safety re­quire­ments cov­er­ing the elec­tri­cal drive train sys­tem of mo­torised PMDs.</p>
    <p>All PMDs in Sin­ga­pore must now be UL2272-cer­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Mr Goh’s PMD was dam­aged in the blaze.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, it could not be as­cer­tained if its bat­tery man­age­ment sys­tem was UL2272-cer­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>The state coroner will give her find­ings at a later date.</p>
