    <p>Based in Hong Kong for over 20 years, high-per­form­ing cor­po­rate lawyer Con­nie Heng re­mains con­nected to Sin­ga­pore, bring­ing her kids here to do a Sin­ga­pore “immersion” for a few weeks each sum­mer.</p>
    <p>An NUS law grad­u­ate from 1995, Ms Heng now leads the Asia-Pa­cific re­gional prac­tice of global law firm Clifford Chance as its re­gional man­ag­ing part­ner for Asia-Pa­cific, a po­si­tion she as­sumed on Nov 1 last year.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing her ca­reer with the law firm that she joined in 2000, she has as­sisted many Hong Kong and Chi­nese is­suers with their se­cu­ri­ties of­fer­ings in the in­ter­na­tional debt cap­i­tal mar­kets, ad­vised on nu­mer­ous land­mark trans­ac­tions and earned many in­dus­try ac­co­lades.</p>
    <p>Placed among the out­stand­ing Sin­ga­porean lawyers abroad, Ms Heng said: “I am very pas­sion­ate about the law and re­ally enjoy trans­ac­tional work and ad­vis­ing clients, which I con­tinue to do in con­junc­tion with my new role.</p>
    <p>I’m also re­ally glad I didn’t shy away from rais­ing my hand for lead­er­ship roles the firm has of­fered me over the years. I hope to en­cour­age and inspire oth­ers, par­tic­u­larly women, to do the same.”</p>
    <p>Ms Heng, whose ca­reer started in the midst of the 1997 Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis, said: “We’ve weath­ered sub­se­quent head­winds, from Sars to the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis. What I’ve learnt is that it is im­por­tant to take op­por­tu­ni­ties as they come, be agile and adapt. The firm’s broad client base to­gether with its rich col­lab­o­ra­tive cul­ture is what at­tracted me and has kept me here for over 20 years.”</p>
    <p>She con­trib­utes to the com­mu­nity and serves as a board direc­tor for the Karen Le­ung Foun­da­tion, a Hong Kong­based char­ity to raise aware­ness of gy­nae­co­log­i­cal can­cer.</p>
    <p>“De­spite be­ing in Hong Kong for over 20 years, I am still very con­nected to Sin­ga­pore. Be­fore Covid, I would visit Sin­ga­pore reg­u­larly, not only to spend time in our Sin­ga­pore of­fice and stay con­nected with Sin­ga­pore clients, but also to stay in touch with fam­ily and friends.</p>
    <p>“My (two) kids also do a Sin­ga­pore ‘immersion’ for a few weeks each sum­mer with their grand­mother, spend­ing time with aunts and cousins, vis­it­ing hawker cen­tres and wet mar­kets and ex­pe­ri­enc­ing Sin­ga­pore’s pub­lic ameni­ties like the Botan­i­cal Gar­dens, fan­tas­tic pub­lic li­braries and mu­se­ums.</p>
    <p>She said: “It is very im­por­tant for me that my chil­dren, as third cul­ture kids, grow up un­der­stand­ing their Sin­ga­pore cul­ture and her­itage.”</p>
