    <p>AUCK­LAND • Wing Caleb Clarke en­joyed a storm­ing first rugby Test start as an ag­gres­sive All Blacks downed Aus­tralia 27-7 with a rol­lick­ing sec­ond half in Auck­land yes­ter­day to an­swer their crit­ics af­ter last week’s draw.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the dra­matic, 16-16 Bledis­loe Cup se­ries opener, the All Blacks led 10-7 at half-time and scored three quick tries af­ter the restart as they piled on 17 unan­swered points in the sec­ond pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Clarke, play­ing in just his sec­ond Test, had the 46,049-strong crowd on the edge of their seats ev­ery time he touched the ball, skit­tling de­fend­ers and evok­ing mem­o­ries of the late for­mer All Black Jonah Lomu as New Zealand played with a re­newed phys­i­cal pres­ence and co­he­sion.</p>
    <p>Wear­ing the No. 11 jersey that was im­mor­talised by Lomu in the 1990s, the 21-year-old’s pow­er­ful run­ning set up tries for Jordie Bar­rett and Ardie Savea within the space of three sec­ond-half min­utes.</p>
    <p>The build-up to Savea’s try was a stand­out as the 1.84m and 107kg Clarke bull­dozed his way through most of the Wal­la­bies side be­fore off-load­ing in sight of the line.</p>
    <p>“When you get the ball, just run. You don’t have to think about any­thing,” said Clarke, the son of for­mer All Black Eroni, who played along­side Lomu in 1998.</p>
    <p>It was the sev­enth time in the past 13 years that the three-time world cham­pi­ons have started the an­nual Bledis­loe Cup se­ries with a loss or a draw and im­me­di­ately bounced back.</p>
    <p>Af­ter be­ing bul­lied at the break­down in the first Test, there was added steel to the All Blacks pack with the in­clu­sion of Dane Coles and the ten­sion was ev­i­dent from the start when al­most all 30 play­ers joined in a shov­ing match be­tween Coles and Taniela Tupou.</p>
    <p>“It was tough, but we’re so damn happy,” said All Blacks cap­tain Sam Cane af­ter fin­ish­ing off a sweep­ing move­ment to end the Aus­tralian chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>“There was a lot of pres­sure this week for a rel­a­tively new squad in a</p>
    <p>The All Blacks went on a blis­ter­ing run in the sec­ond half, scor­ing 17 with­out re­ply in 11 min­utes to seal the win. lot of ways and I’m re­ally proud of the way we stuck to our plan.</p>
    <p>“We worked re­ally, re­ally hard and in the end we man­aged to break them.”</p>
    <p>The four tries-to-one vic­tory ex­tended the All Blacks’ im­pres­sive record at Eden Park, where they have not lost in 44 Tests since 1994 and where Aus­tralia have not won since 1986.</p>
    <p>They need to win only one of the two re­main­ing games in the Bledis­loe Cup se­ries, which will be played in Aus­tralia as part of the up­com­ing Tri-Na­tions tour­na­ment, to re­tain the tro­phy they have held since 2003.</p>
    <p>“Tackle ex­e­cu­tion,” Aus­tralia coach Dave Ren­nie said when asked to sum up what the dif­fer­ence in the seven days was, point­ing to the Wal­la­bies miss­ing more than 30 tack­les in Auck­land.</p>
    <p>“We missed too many tack­les and we got put un­der the heat for it.”</p>
    <p>The game was only the sec­ond rugby Test played world­wide since March, and in front of packed stands at Eden Park af­ter New Zealand suc­cess­fully con­tained the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
