    <p>LIS­BON • A year ago, Bay­ern Mu­nich nar­rowly emerged as cham­pi­ons in one of the tight­est Bun­desliga ti­tle races, and ended up over­haul­ing their age­ing squad as veter­ans Franck Ribery, Ar­jen Robben and Rafinha all left.</p>
    <p>Fast for­ward 12 months and a leaner, stronger and faster Bay­ern are not only Ger­man league and Cup win­ners again, but they pro­duced one of the most re­mark­able dis­plays in Euro­pean his­tory last Fri­day, oblit­er­at­ing Barcelona 8-2 to reach the Cham­pi­ons League semi-fi­nals.</p>
    <p>Fluid in their move­ments and with an in­de­fati­ga­ble de­sire to at­tack, Hansi Flick’s side look like they have been forged to­gether over years of train­ing.</p>
    <p>Yet many of the el­e­ments of their suc­cess, in­clud­ing the coach, who took over a strug­gling Bay­ern in Novem­ber, are new, with the 2014 World Cup-win­ning as­sis­tant de­mand­ing they win pos­ses­sion much ear­lier than un­der his pre­de­ces­sor.</p>
    <p>That re­lent­less press­ing has been the hall­mark of Bay­ern, RB Leipzig and Borus­sia Dort­mund, who were elim­i­nated by Paris Saint-Ger­main in the last 16 in this sea­son’s Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool’s Jur­gen Klopp, who led the Reds to their sixth Euro­pean Cup last term, first coined that style as “gegen­press­ing” and it has since been the ideal way to set a team up.</p>
    <p>For the first time, three coaches from the same na­tion, Ger­many, are in the last four of the Cham­pi­ons League at the same time. That is a tes­ta­ment to the strength of the Bun­desliga, long dis­missed as a one-horse race featuring Bay­ern, and its com­mit­ment to giv­ing lo­cal man­agers a chance.</p>
    <p>“It’s clear that this is lovely for Ger­man foot­ball,” Leipzig boss Ju­lian Nagels­mann, who at 33 is the youngest coach to have reached the last four, said.</p>
    <p>“Coach­ing ed­u­ca­tion in Ger­many is good. I en­joyed a good ap­pren­tice­ship as a trainer and was sat­is­fied with what I picked up along the way.</p>
    <p>“I al­ways look back to words that said Ger­man foot­ball would be left be­hind on the in­ter­na­tional stage be­cause we mainly had Ger­man coaches. And now every­thing is great.”</p>
    <p>Un­like in other coun­tries, where a Uefa Pro Li­cence is suf­fi­cient, a Foot­ball Coach­ing Li­cence is re­quired be­fore one can coach in the Ger­man top flight. That means putting in closer to 800 hours of work, as op­posed to 240 hours for its con­ti­nen­tal equiv­a­lent. Flick, Paris Saint-Ger­main man­ager Thomas Tuchel and Nagels­mann are all grad­u­ates of the Hen­nesWeiswei­ler Academy.</p>
    <p>The at­ten­tion to de­tail is not lost on former Ger­many striker Oliver Bier­hoff, who is now the di­rec­tor of Die Mannschaft and its academy.</p>
    <p>“It’s a won­der­ful mo­ment of suc­cess for Ger­man foot­ball,” he told the Bun­desliga web­site. “We’re de­lighted to have not only two Ger­man teams in the semis, but also three Ger­man coaches and lots of our in­ter­na­tional play­ers in the de­ci­sive phase of the com­pe­ti­tion.”</p>
    <p>Some crit­ics have pointed to the fact that un­like English, Ital­ian and Span­ish clubs, Ger­man sides were able to en­joy a break in the lead up to the “Fi­nal Eight” tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>The Serie A, Pre­mier League and La Liga sea­sons all fin­ished ei­ther at the end of last month or early this month, while the Bun­desliga sea­son ended in late June.</p>
    <p>But de­spite the ad­van­tage pro­vided by the hia­tus, Leipzig, Bay­ern and PSG un­der their coaches all rep­re­sent a style that has evolved from the tiki-taka play that most teams tried to em­u­late from a decade ago.</p>
    <p>Clos­ing the ball down quickly is what to­day’s mod­ern foot­ball re­quires.</p>
