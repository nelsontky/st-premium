    <p>Con­tin­ued growth in e-com­merce de­liv­er­ies helped lift rev­enue at Sin­ga­pore Post in the first quar­ter, but that could not off­set the harsh im­pact from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It noted that turnover in­creased 12 per cent to $360 mil­lion for the three months to June 30.</p>
    <p>This was driven by the con­tin­ued growth in the in­ter­na­tional post and par­cel busi­ness, as well as at the Couri­er­sPlease and Quan­tium So­lu­tions sub­sidiaries.</p>
    <p>How­ever, higher rev­enue brought about a cor­re­spond­ing in­crease in costs as a re­sult of sup­ply chain dis­rup­tions.</p>
    <p>Ex­penses grew 22 per cent to $341 mil­lion for the pe­riod, SingPost noted in an up­date on Tues­day night.</p>
    <p>This sent group profit on op­er­at­ing ac­tiv­i­ties fall­ing from $42 mil­lion a year ear­lier to $22 mil­lion for the quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Its fi­nan­cial per­for­mance was also hit by the “ad­verse im­pact” the pan­demic had on the firm’s cus­tomers with doubt­ful debt pro­vi­sions pos­si­bly in­creas­ing, SingPost said.</p>
    <p>E-com­merce vol­umes rose across the board in Sin­ga­pore, Aus­tralia and in­ter­na­tion­ally for the quar­ter. SingPost de­liv­ered 8.7 mil­lion items un­der the do­mes­tic post and par­cel e-com­merce busi­ness, up 52 per cent from a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>“Ini­tia­tives such as the new tracked let­ter­box prod­uct fa­cil­i­tated con­tact­less de­liv­er­ies at a cost-ef­fec­tive price point and saw sig­nif­i­cant trac­tion among cus­tomers,” the com­pany said.</p>
    <p>E-com­merce vol­umes for the in­ter­na­tional and post and par­cel busi­ness grew 30 per cent to 7.2 mil­lion kg in the quar­ter.</p>
    <p>How­ever, vol­umes of let­ters and printed pa­pers in Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ued to shrink, fall­ing by a third to 100 mil­lion items de­liv­ered com­pared with 149 mil­lion a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>This down­trend was “ex­pected due to elec­tronic sub­sti­tu­tion”, and was ex­ac­er­bated by re­duced busi­ness mail­ing dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker for most of the quar­ter, SingPost said.</p>
    <p>Costs also in­creased as a re­sult of health and safety ar­range­ments, in­clud­ing tem­po­rary hous­ing for Malaysian em­ploy­ees here.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the pan­demic caused a “mas­sive dis­rup­tion” to in­ter­na­tional air freight out of Changi Air­port, which led to de­lays and in­creased con­veyance costs.</p>
    <p>SingPost shares closed 1.43 per cent up at 71 cents yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>E-com­merce vol­umes rose across the board in Sin­ga­pore, Aus­tralia and in­ter­na­tion­ally for the quar­ter. SingPost de­liv­ered 8.7 mil­lion items un­der the do­mes­tic post and par­cel e-com­merce busi­ness, up 52 per cent from a year ear­lier.</p>
