    <p>Ama­zon.com is get­ting the Google treat­ment.</p>
    <p>Google’s years of pun­ish­ment over an­titrust vi­o­la­tions meant the on­line ad­ver­tis­ing gi­ant started book­ing “Euro­pean Com­mis­sion fine” as a re­cur­ring cost in its an­nual earn­ings re­ports – the cu­mu­la­tive fig­ure has topped €8.2 bil­lion (S$13 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>Ama­zon is the next in line. On Tues­day, Euro­pean an­titrust chief Mar­grethe Vestager in­ten­si­fied a probe that started last year into the e-com­merce com­pany by is­su­ing a state­ment of ob­jec­tions to how it uses data from third-party sell­ers of goods on its mar­ket­place.</p>
    <p>She also an­nounced a fresh probe into whether it gives its own prod­ucts pref­er­en­tial place­ment.</p>
    <p>If Ama­zon chief ex­ec­u­tive Jeff Be­zos thought the af­fair was inch­ing closer to a res­o­lu­tion, he was sorely mis­taken. Ama­zon could yet be ex­on­er­ated of any mis­do­ing, though the ob­jec­tions raised do in­crease the like­li­hood of fines be­ing levied or changes to busi­ness prac­tices be­ing im­posed.</p>
    <p>That first in­quiry fo­cuses on whether the Seat­tle-based com­pany looks at data from its mar­ket­place, where any­one can sell their goods, to de­ter­mine which prod­ucts are popular and prof­itable, then sells them it­self.</p>
    <p>In some popular cat­e­gories, Ama­zon lists less than 10 per cent of the goods avail­able yet gob­bles up 50 per cent of the rev­enue, Ms Vestager said, cit­ing it as ev­i­dence that the com­pany cherry-picks the most lu­cra­tive cat­e­gories.</p>
    <p>The Ama­zon de­fence tends to be twofold: first, that this is no dif­fer­ent from a su­per­mar­ket stock­ing its own-brand ce­real; sec­ond, that if the ef­fect is lower prices for con­sumers, then it can’t be deemed anti-com­pet­i­tive.</p>
    <p>The first point is mis­lead­ing. A su­per­mar­ket can in­deed stock own-brand goods, but it does so af­ter hav­ing bought prod­ucts from sup­pli­ers and de­ter­mined their pop­u­lar­ity. In short, the su­per­mar­ket took the ini­tial risk.</p>
    <p>Ama­zon takes es­sen­tially no risk; it just col­lects data from the sell­ers that use its plat­form. In­deed, the sell­ers of­ten pay it for the priv­i­lege of a list­ing or for as­so­ci­ated lo­gis­tics ser­vices.</p>
    <p>As for pric­ing, this has since the 1970s been the lens through which reg­u­la­tors eval­u­ate mo­nop­oly power. But the con­ver­sa­tion is evolv­ing – low prices may not al­ways be in the con­sumer’s in­ter­est if they squeeze out com­pe­ti­tion, thereby dam­ag­ing prospects for innovation and con­sumer choice.</p>
    <p>It’s tempt­ing to look at all this as a war of at­tri­tion, with Ama­zon on one side and the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion on the other. In that light, the com­mis­sion has shown with its lat­est probe that it is hun­ker­ing down for the long haul.</p>
    <p>But it needn’t be looked at as a zero-sum game, a case of the com­mis­sion win­ning and</p>
    <p>Ama­zon los­ing. There is scope for ev­ery­one to come out of this pos­i­tively if you re­mem­ber that what’s at stake is the success of small(er) busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>There is no doubt that many have thrived by sell­ing on Ama­zon. But it can be a pre­car­i­ous ex­is­tence, of­ten be­holden to the whims of an al­go­rithm.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Ama­zon has a fidu­ciary duty to op­ti­mise the busi­ness for its share­hold­ers – driv­ing prices down gen­er­ates more growth, and the mar­ket re­wards it ac­cord­ingly. How­ever, that growth seems to come at the cost of oner­ous con­di­tions for many of its sup­pli­ers.</p>
    <p>The mount­ing reg­u­la­tory push­back in Europe, the United States and Asia should give Ama­zon the cover to re­cal­i­brate those dy­nam­ics and make it eas­ier for small busi­nesses to flour­ish with­out the threat of a Damo­clean sword.</p>
    <p>In­vestors would surely pre­fer that to the worst-case al­ter­na­tive, which would be an in­ter­nal sep­a­ra­tion of the Ama­zon mar­ket­place from the rest of the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft’s ex­pe­ri­ence as the an­titrust bete noire is well worn but nonethe­less in­struc­tive. It weath­ered the storm and emerged as a gen­tler but nonethe­less highly suc­cess­ful com­pany – its mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion ex­ceeds that of Ama­zon.</p>
    <p>Even if the Euro­pean in­ves­ti­ga­tions don’t ul­ti­mately im­pose change on Ama­zon, they might yet en­cour­age some new at­ti­tudes.</p>
