    <p>LON­DON • Coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions are surg­ing again in Europe, but cur­rent data in­di­cates the out­break is be­com­ing less deadly.</p>
    <p>In­creased test­ing is catch­ing the dis­ease ear­lier, and in con­trast to spikes in March and April – when the pan­demic ripped through nurs­ing homes – the au­thor­i­ties are do­ing a bet­ter job of pro­tect­ing the el­derly and other vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple, ac­cord­ing to sci­en­tists.</p>
    <p>The Rome re­gion recorded 215 new Covid-19 cases in 24 hours mainly be­cause of peo­ple re­turn­ing from hol­i­day, the largest such rise since the Ital­ian cap­i­tal was in lock­down in March, health of­fi­cials said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>France and Spain both recorded the high­est num­bers of new cases since April in the past week, while Ger­many’s daily rates have dou­bled in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>Yet, as the con­ta­gion spreads again across the con­ti­nent, fa­tal­i­ties are ris­ing less dra­mat­i­cally – at least for now. “Im­proved ac­cess to test­ing is likely to be the main rea­son, es­pe­cially as peo­ple be­come more aware of the symp­toms,” said Dr John Ford, a lec­turer in pub­lic health at the Univer­sity of Cam­bridge.</p>
    <p>Many of the i nfec­tions stem from younger peo­ple trav­el­ling and par­ty­ing dur­ing the sum­mer hol­i­days, and some of those cases have been asymp­to­matic. Bet­ter treat­ment of the dis­ease and im­proved pro­ce­dures for iden­ti­fy­ing Covid-re­lated deaths also helped lower the death toll, Dr Ford said.</p>
    <p>With Euro­pean coun­tries grad­u­ally re­open­ing their economies, in­clud­ing green­light­ing travel in mid-June, of­fi­cials have been brac­ing them­selves for a surge as more peo­ple re­sume con­tact with oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel, who won plau­dits for her han­dling of the ini­tial phases of the pan­demic, ad­vised her peers to avoid re­newed lock­downs and to co­or­di­nate ac­tions.</p>
    <p>The fo­cus in­stead is on tar­geted mea­sures such as step­ping up the use of face masks, re­strict­ing op­er­a­tions of bars and restau­rants, and re­quir­ing trav­ellers re­turn­ing from hard-hit ar­eas to quar­an­tine or prove they are not in­fected.</p>
    <p>Speedy drug tri­als could be partly re­spon­si­ble for the death toll re­main­ing in check, with ther­a­peu­tics like the low-cost, an­ti­in­flam­ma­tory dex­am­etha­sone found to re­duce the mor­tal­ity of se­verely ill Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of coun­tries have also changed how deaths are cal­cu­lated in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>The United King­dom toll fell by more than 5,000 ear­lier this month after the gov­ern­ment said a fa­tal­ity would be classed as Covidre­lated only if the per­son died within 28 days of a pos­i­tive test.</p>
    <p>Since in­fec­tions in most Euro­pean coun­tries be­gan climb­ing only days or a few weeks ago, deaths could rise again too.</p>
    <p>Given the lag be­tween in­fec­tion and death, it is im­por­tant coun­tries do not de­velop a false sense of se­cu­rity, said Pro­fes­sor Gra­ham Cooke, an in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert at Im­pe­rial Col­lege Lon­don.</p>
    <p>“There’s al­ways a sig­nif­i­cant de­lay be­tween a spike in cases and a spike in deaths, which is in the re­gion of weeks,” said Prof Cooke.</p>
    <p>“It’s pos­si­ble that if more of the trans­mis­sion early on is be­tween younger groups that there will be more of a de­lay be­fore we see the rise in mor­tal­ity.”</p>
