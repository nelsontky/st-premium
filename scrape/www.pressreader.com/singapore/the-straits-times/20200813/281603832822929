    <p>In­tro­duced in the midst of Sin­ga­pore’s cir­cuit breaker pe­riod in May, Tekka Mar­ket’s live on­line auc­tions promised much as an in­no­va­tive and dig­i­tal way to buy wet mar­ket es­sen­tials.</p>
    <p>But the ap­peal of live wet mar­ket auc­tions has been short-lived, with sell­ers point­ing to is­sues from tak­ing or­ders to pack­ing and de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>More­over, af­ter the cir­cuit breaker ended on June 1 and the crowds started to re­turn to the mar­ket, few also saw the need to con­duct live on­line auc­tions.</p>
    <p>Chia’s Vegetable Sup­ply was among the six Tekka Mar­ket ven­dors that par­tic­i­pated in the first live auc­tions as part of an ini­tia­tive or­gan­ised by the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity (IMDA) to dig­i­talise wet mar­ket busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>De­spite 28,000 tun­ing into the first Face­book livestream, the stall de­cided to drop out af­ter just two rounds. Stall owner Vic­tor Chia said the added has­sle and costs in­volved in in­te­grat­ing live stream­ing into the busi­ness were sim­ply not worth the trou­ble.</p>
    <p>“We are used to the way where peo­ple just choose what they want and pay (up­front), but with live stream­ing it’s a lot of ex­tra work from tak­ing the or­ders to pack­ing and en­gag­ing the lo­gis­tics com­pany (for de­liv­ery),” said Mr Chia, who is in his 40s.</p>
    <p>He added that pay­ing to have goods de­liv­ered to cus­tomers places a fur­ther fi­nan­cial bur­den on stall­hold­ers – af­ter IMDA’s sub­si­dies for the first two live streams dried up. “I think on­line stream­ing can be great for some peo­ple but it’s not con­ducive for us in the wet mar­ket,” Mr Chia said.</p>
    <p>Mr Kino Lee, 19, the sec­ond-gen­er­a­tion owner of seafood ven­dor LYHseafood, said there was a lack of un­der­stand­ing be­tween stall own­ers and the lo­gis­tics part­ner, lead­ing to de­liv­ery de­lays.</p>
    <p>Even though he was not in­volved in the auc­tions, he heard from fel­low stall own­ers about the long de­liv­ery de­lays as stall­hold­ers did not know they needed to pack food dif­fer­ently.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, seafood has to be tightly wrapped to avoid spillage dur­ing trans­porta­tion and de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>“They just put it in a plas­tic bag,” he said, not­ing that time was wasted repack­ing the items.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that lo­gis­tics com­pany Tada Fresh is the ap­pointed lo­gis­tics provider in Tekka Mar­ket. A check of the Tekka On­line Mar­ket Face­book page re­vealed that the last live auc­tion was by fish­mon­gers 81 Sheng Yu on July 28. The post drew two likes and a lone share, a far cry from the first posts which saw hun­dreds of likes and thou­sands of com­ments. Tada Fresh did not re­spond by press time.</p>
