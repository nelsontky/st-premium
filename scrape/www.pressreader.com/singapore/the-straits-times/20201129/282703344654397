    <p>For once, sub­merge all nag­ging con­cerns about the greens and fair­ways of the Sin­ga­pore Is­land Coun­try Club’s New Course into the flow­ing pools of the spec­tac­u­lar wa­ter­falls adorn­ing the im­pres­sive club­house.</p>
    <p>I came away with this deep im­pres­sion after play­ing a round at the re­de­vel­oped New Course’s Com­pos­ite Nine, which also left me in awe and won­der as to how a medi­ocre lay­out is be­ing trans­formed into a fab­u­lous course.</p>
    <p>No doubt, it is early days yet, with re­de­vel­op­ment of the New and Mil­len­nium cour­ses into a cham­pi­onship 27-hole won­der still al­most two years away from be­ing the fin­ished prod­uct.</p>
    <p>But from in­di­ca­tions of the play­ing ex­pe­ri­ence on the Com­pos­ite Nine are a gauge, SICC mem­bers and their guests are set for a grand open­ing of a great course.</p>
    <p>The greens, once the club’s bug­bear, are in great shape, the fair­ways are pris­tine and the bunkers as best as they can be.</p>
    <p>And the set-up has a fresh, clean look.</p>
    <p>The New Course was last re­de­vel­oped in 2002, with only mi­nor rec­ti­fi­ca­tions work un­der­taken since. The ir­ri­ga­tion and drainage sys­tems have been in need of ma­jor up­grad­ing works. The greens pro­file and drainage sys­tem had de­te­rio</p>
    <p>rated over the years, and the Tifd­warf Ber­muda tur­f­grass had also mu­tated and be­come con­tam­i­nated with a mix­ture of other un­de­sir­able grasses.</p>
    <p>The fair­ways which were orig­i­nally planted with lo­cal Zoysia grass had also be­come highly con­tam­i­nated with un­de­sir­able grasses and weeds.</p>
    <p>If those were not enough rea­sons for the club to em­bark on a pro­ject that is es­ti­mated to cost be­tween $40 mil­lion and $50 mil­lion, the im­pend­ing loss of the club’s Sime and Bukit cour­ses by 2030 makes it all the more im­por­tant that the New Course needed a ma­jor up­grad­ing.</p>
    <p>In fact, many com­pelling rea­sons have been put for­ward by the club’s gen­eral com­mit­tee for the grand for­ward step.</p>
    <p>One, SICC is set to lose the Sime course in 2021 to Kep­pel Club, and the Bukit course in 2030. This is part of the Govern­ment’s re­view of golf cour­ses in Sin­ga­pore in which the num­ber of 18-hole cour­ses will be re­duced from 20 in 2015 to 15 in 2021, and to 13 by 2030.</p>
    <p>So if noth­ing was done at the Is­land lo­ca­tion with the loss of the Bukit lo­ca­tion, there would be a se­vere short­age of play­ing times, es­pe­cially dur­ing week­ends, for the club’s 3,000-strong ac­tive golfers among the 18,000 mem­bers.</p>
    <p>There­fore, it was im­per­a­tive to ex­plore op­tions to in­crease the golf­ing ca­pac­ity at Is­land lo­ca­tion and the most vi­able op­tion was to re­de­velop the New and Mil­len­nium cour­ses into a 27-hole course.</p>
    <p>Then, with golf cour­ses be­com­ing more limited in Sin­ga­pore in the fu­ture, high-qual­ity golf cour­ses are likely to com­mand a pre­mium. In­vest­ment in golf cour­ses may be ex­pected to pro­vide the club with a re­turn on in­vest­ment in the form of fu­ture higher mem­ber­ship value.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther costs are in­evitable as for re­de­vel­op­ment plans the Govern­ment re­quire­ment is that a public park con­nec­tor along the reser­voir edge, start­ing from Hole 15 and 16 of the New Course to the TreeTop Walk is to be con­structed.</p>
    <p>Also, the club is re­quired to en­sure that it is self-suf­fi­cient in water, which calls for the con­struc­tion of an ad­e­quate and ef­fi­cient water man­age­ment and rain­wa­ter har­vest­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The big­gest pos­i­tive is that within the limited land avail­able at the Is­land lo­ca­tion, the con­struc­tion of a 27-hole course will add 46,720 golf rounds per year to the ex­ist­ing 159,744 rounds per year at the Is­land lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>It will help con­sid­er­ably to mit­i­gate the loss of golf rounds when the land leases of Sime (79,872 golf rounds per year) and Bukit cour­ses (79,872 golf rounds per year) ex­pire.</p>
    <p>The club felt that it is im­por­tant to time the re­de­vel­op­ment when mem­bers can con­tinue to play at Bukit and Sime cour­ses, be­fore they are handed over. And it will en­sure proper sched­ul­ing and plan­ning to min­imise down­time and dis­rup­tion so that mem­bers can con­tinue to en­joy play­ing.</p>
    <p>Out of 12 rec­om­men­da­tions, Gra­ham Marsh Golf De­sign was se­lected as the golf course ar­chi­tect to re­con­fig­ure the 27-hole lay­out. Sev­eral re­vi­sions were made there­after to en­hance the de­sign, namely the three nines play to par-36, par-36 and par-35.</p>
    <p>The mas­sive ad­di­tions of rounds at the 27-hole course will help con­sid­er­ably to mit­i­gate the loss of golf rounds when the land leases of Sime and Bukit cour­ses ex­pire.</p>
    <p>The three nines are named Mil­len­nium, Peirce and For­est and the club is tar­get­ing to com­plete the re­de­vel­op­ment of 27 holes in 18 to 21 months.</p>
