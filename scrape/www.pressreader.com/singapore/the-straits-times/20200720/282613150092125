    <p>Un­til the em­bargo of live con­certs is lifted post-cir­cuit breaker, mu­sic lovers will have to be con­tent with pre-recorded dig­i­tal con­certs.</p>
    <p>Pre­sented by the Sin­ga­pore Sym­phony Group in its Vic­to­ria Con­cert Hall Presents series, this 2018 pro­duc­tion of Fran­cis Poulenc’s sin­gle-act, sin­gle-singer cham­ber opera La Voix Hu­maine (The Hu­man Voice), first streamed last week­end, was a rare gem.</p>
    <p>Per­formed be­fore a live au­di­ence, its plot in­volved Elle (the generic “she” in French) in a fi­nal con­ver­sa­tion with her for­mer lover.</p>
    <p>Cen­tral to the 1958 opera, adapted from play­wright Jean Cocteau’s 1928 script, was the tele­phone, a mod­ern con­ve­nience and prop that was sup­posed to fig­ure promi­nently through­out.</p>
    <p>Wrong num­bers, crossed con­nec­tions and in­ept tele­phone op­er­a­tors were comedic el­e­ments in the serious melo­drama. How­ever, in di­rec­tor Ivan Heng’s con­cep­tion, that phys­i­cal means of com­mu­ni­ca­tion was to­tally ex­punged.</p>
    <p>This al­lowed pro­tag­o­nist Elle the free­dom of move­ment, to wan­der about on­stage and sing with­out im­ped­i­ment.</p>
    <p>The tele­phone’s only hint was a long red cord tightly wound around the grand pi­ano on which pi­anist Shane Thio played.</p>
    <p>Also ab­sent was Elle’s faith­less lover, although his in­sid­i­ous pres­ence might be in­ferred i n furtive on-screen pro­jec­tions and Thio’s sock­less red sneak­ers.</p>
    <p>En­liven­ing the an­guished Elle was United States-based Sin­ga­porean so­prano Jennifer Lien, whose mono­logue was a tour-de­force of lyri­cal and dra­matic role-play.</p>
    <p>The for­mer Busi­ness Times jour­nal­ist turned op­er­atic diva was fully im­mersed in the multi-faceted part and emoted bril­liantly i n id­iomatic French (with the au­di­ence well served by English translit­er­a­tions).</p>
    <p>Through the opera’s com­pact 40 minutes, she bril­liantly lived through Kubler-Ross’s five stages of grief.</p>
    <p>Shift­ing ef­fort­lessly be­tween de­nial, anger, bar­gain­ing, de­pres­sion and ac­cep­tance, she of­ten mixed these up in an in­tox­i­cat­ing melange of fraught and barely con­tained emo­tions.</p>
    <p>With hys­ter­i­cal out­bursts al­ter­nat­ing with episodes of lu­cid­ity, this was a multi-lay­ered and grand­stand­ing per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>Poulenc’s mu­sic was un­remit­tingly tonal, but lib­er­ally laced with dis­so­nances and abrupt fig­u­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>Lien flit­ted through recita­tive and out­right song, in which a pen­chant for sen­ti­men­tal­ity was re­vealed, al­beit briefly.</p>
    <p>There was a short waltz-song se­quence mid­way through, with a cas­cade of fall­ing pills pro­jected be­hind the per­former.</p>
    <p>This was more than an al­lu­sion to a drug-in­duced fit of pique, also for­ti­fied by a well-placed bot­tle of liquor.</p>
    <p>What­ever was Elle’s fate be­came im­ma­te­rial by the opera’s pas­sion­ate but lyri­cal close.</p>
    <p>All that re­mained were the fren­zied cir­cum­stances and states of mind that led to her fate­ful de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>In short, The Hu­man Voice was an in-depth trea­tise of the hu­man con­di­tion, frag­ile psy­che, warts and all.</p>
    <p>That it was cap­tured with such tren­chancy speaks vol­umes of all the artists in­volved.</p>
