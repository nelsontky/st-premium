    <p>• Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence will at­tend the in­au­gu­ra­tion of Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den and Vice-Pres­i­dent-elect Kamala Har­ris, break­ing ranks with Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, who said that he would not at­tend.</p>
    <p>Mr Pence plans to be at the Jan 20 event, ac­cord­ing to two peo­ple fa­mil­iar with his plans who asked not to be iden­ti­fied dis­cussing in­ter­nal de­lib­er­a­tions. Mr Trump, in the fi­nal tweet be­fore his ac­count was sus­pended by Twit­ter on Fri­day, said that he “will not be go­ing to the In­au­gu­ra­tion”.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, the Vice-Pres­i­dent de­fied Mr Trump’s call to over­turn the elec­tion and in­stead ful­filled his cer­e­mo­nial duty to pre­side over Congress’ ac­cep­tance of the Elec­toral Col­lege re­sults.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the pro­ceed­ings, an an­gry mob of Trump sup­port­ers de­scended on the Capi­tol and over­took se­cu­rity, storm­ing into the build­ing and caus­ing law­mak­ers and oth­ers to evac­u­ate. Five peo­ple were killed in the melee, in­clud­ing a po­lice of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, Mr Bi­den, speak­ing to re­porters, said he agreed that Mr Trump shouldn’t at­tend the in­au­gu­ra­tion but that Mr Pence was “wel­come”, and that he would be hon­oured if the Vice-Pres­i­dent were to at­tend.</p>
    <p>“I’d be hon­oured to have him there,” Mr Bi­den said.</p>
    <p>Mr Pence has grown es­tranged from Mr Trump after the Pres­i­dent blasted him for not in­ter­ven­ing in the con­gres­sional count of Elec­toral Col­lege votes. Mr Trump had tweeted that Mr Pence lacked “courage”.</p>
