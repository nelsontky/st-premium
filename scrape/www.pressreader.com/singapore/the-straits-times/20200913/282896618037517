    <p>Q What has been your big­gest in­vest­ing mis­take?</p>
    <p>A My big­gest mis­take was to agree to in­vest in a com­mer­cial prop­erty with some part­ners. The chal­lenge that I did not fore­see was that not ev­ery­one was on the same page on the exit strat­egy.</p>
    <p>We had a good of­fer af­ter buy­ing the prop­erty for only a year but the main stake­holder de­cided not to sell it. I de­cided to sell my share at a slight dis­count as I de­cided I had had enough.</p>
    <p>I am ap­pre­cia­tive that the re­main­ing part­ners were will­ing buy­ers of my share. The loss is min­i­mal but there was a lot of frus­tra­tion in the process, and the les­son learnt is that I will think twice about such a ven­ture again.</p>
    <p>Q And your best in­vest­ment?</p>
    <p>A The best in­vest­ment has been my fi­nan­cial ad­vi­sory business.</p>
    <p>This is my first and only ca­reer so far. It is not just the mon­e­tary in­vest­ment – the sweat, en­ergy and re­sources I have in­vested to grow my ad­vi­sory business have also been worth it. I am grate­ful to have had many men­tors who guided me along the way.</p>
    <p>I also have im­mense sat­is­fac­tion know­ing that I have made a dif­fer­ence to my clients and the team of fi­nan­cial rep­re­sen­ta­tives that I lead.</p>
    <p>The hall­mark of a suc­cess­ful fi­nan­cial rep­re­sen­ta­tive is one who lis­tens in­tently to the needs and pri­or­i­ties of clients, and guides them to make plans and de­ci­sions that will put them in good stead for the fu­ture. It is about hav­ing the best in­ter­ests of our clients in mind, in all that we do.</p>
