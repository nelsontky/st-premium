    <p>Ahead of Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics (SA)’s Sept 25 elec­tion, Team Ground Up say they are ready to hit the ground run­ning and have al­ready se­cured $100,000 through do­na­tions to get their plans go­ing if they are voted into power.</p>
    <p>Last night, the slate of nine, led by SA pres­i­den­tial hope­ful Lien Choong Luen, laid out their vi­sion for the sport in a vir­tual town hall.</p>
    <p>They are so far the only team to have thrown their names into the hat and are seek­ing to win the votes of SA’s 23 af­fil­i­ates at the na­tional sports as­so­ci­a­tion’s an­nual gen­eral meet­ing.</p>
    <p>Lien, the gen­eral man­ager of ride-hail­ing app Go­jek, said part of the $100,000 would go to­wards turn­ing in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing into re­gional train­ing centres.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes pro­vid­ing coaches for young ath­letes from schools that do not fo­cus on track and field so that they have op­por­tu­ni­ties to pur­sue the sport.</p>
    <p>The $100,000 will also be used to pro­vide ad­di­tional sup­port for ath­letes go­ing for over­seas com­pe­ti­tions, as well as for or­gan­is­ing com­pe­ti­tions lo­cally.</p>
    <p>Marinda Teo, who is run­ning for the post of vice-pres­i­dent (fi­nance and part­ner­ships), said: “More can be done when we’re voted into of­fice and when we start to ex­e­cute the plans we have crafted.</p>
    <p>“These do­na­tions are im­por­tant as they can help us op­ti­mise the grants we have re­ceived from Sport Sin­ga­pore. We can also build plat­forms to mon­e­tise our core ca­pa­bil­i­ties in sports events or­gan­i­sa­tion to pro­duce sus­tain­able streams of in­come, which can be in­vested back into ath­let­ics.”</p>
    <p>The vir­tual meet­ing was at­tended by a wide range of mem­bers from the ath­let­ics fra­ter­nity, in­clud­ing the likes of vet­eran coach Mar­garet Oh and Wings Ath­letic Club pres­i­dent Jezreel Mok.</p>
    <p>In the con­fer­ence which lasted 1hr 30min, Lien talked about re­build­ing trust in the com­mu­nity through open com­mu­ni­ca­tion with the fra­ter­nity. Team Ground Up also said that, if elected, their short­term pri­or­i­ties would be to ad­dress out­stand­ing le­gal is­sues, en­gage ath­letes and Sport Sin­ga­pore, and re­view fi­nances and key in­ter­nal op­er­at­ing pro­cesses at SA.</p>
    <p>The as­so­ci­a­tion has been be­set by in­ter­nal strife and court pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>Lien said: “We un­der­stand that not ev­ery­thing can be re­solved am­i­ca­bly and that it may still con­tinue to es­ca­late, but we will make a re­ally good ef­fort to re­set these is­sues. My pri­or­ity is to get ev­ery­one back at the table, do it away from the lime­light and hope­fully we can come to an ar­range­ment. ”</p>
    <p>Team Ground Up also shared their plans for the sport, in­clud­ing how they aim to solve the prob­lem of the high at­tri­tion rate of young ath­letes in ath­let­ics such as by work­ing with the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion to pro­vide coach­ing cour­ses for phys­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion teach­ers.</p>
    <p>They are also look­ing to make the In­sti­tute-Var­sity-Polytech­nic Games as spectacula­r as the Na­tional School Games and to in­clude those in the Un­der-23 cat­e­gory in Na­tional Youth Cham­pi­onships.</p>
