    <p>Lo­cal small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) should be given a leg-up in se­cur­ing gov­ern­ment con­tracts, and this is just one of the many mea­sures that can be ex­plored to help them re­cover and emerge stronger from the pan­demic, said Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Tan See Leng.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan, who is also Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Man­power and Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice, said in an in­ter­view with Money FM 89.3’s Howie Lim yes­ter­day that gov­ern­ment poli­cies can be bet­ter adapted to help start-ups and SMEs scale up.</p>
    <p>“No par­tic­u­lar pol­icy can be that pre­cise. But I think we can bet­ter adapt, we can bet­ter tweak (poli­cies) to reach out to an ever-en­larg­ing group of en­trepreneur­s in Sin­ga­pore,” said Dr Tan.</p>
    <p>When these firms reach a cer­tain level, they need val­i­da­tion from gov­ern­ment agen­cies the same way that big­ger com­pa­nies do, he added.</p>
    <p>“So in terms of gov­ern­ment pro­cure­ment poli­cies, we can pro­vide them with a lift up, that pro­vides them with a form of cre­den­tial­ing. Then, they can com­pete in­ter­na­tion­ally, hav­ing been cer­ti­fied and val­i­dated by the big gov­ern­mentlinked com­pa­nies here in Sin­ga­pore,” said Dr Tan.</p>
    <p>He also out­lined gov­ern­ment mea­sures to help busi­nesses and work­ers re­cover and re­new them­selves.</p>
    <p>In the short term, he said, mea­sures like the Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS) of wage subsidies and the Self­Em­ployed Per­son In­come Re­lief Scheme have helped to save the ma­jor­ity of com­pa­nies and jobs here.</p>
    <p>In the medium term, he said, the Jobs Growth In­cen­tive (JGI) and grad­ual ta­per­ing of the JSS will min­imise the “cliff ef­fect” that a sud­den with­drawal of these re­lief schemes would have. “That will con­tinue to al­lay the fears of re­trench­ment and busi­nesses shut­ting down.”</p>
    <p>Last month, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat an­nounced the JGI, which sup­ports busi­nesses to hire Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>For each new lo­cal hire aged be­low 40, the Gov­ern­ment will co-pay 25 per cent of the first $5,000 of gross monthly wages for 12 months from the month of hire. For each new ma­ture lo­cal hire aged 40 and above, gov­ern­ment sup­port will be dou­ble that at 50 per cent.</p>
    <p>The JSS was ex­tended by up to seven months, to cover wages paid up to March next year for firms in sec­tors harder hit by the Covid-19 pan­demic, and up to De­cem­ber this year for sec­tors that are cop­ing well.</p>
    <p>But no amount of short-term re­lief is enough if there are no new busi­nesses and rev­enue streams com­ing in, and this is why the Gov­ern­ment is ex­plor­ing ways to open up the coun­try for trade, Dr Tan said. “We are think­ing of cre­ative ways where one doesn’t need to travel, whether it is through sign­ing dig­i­tal econ­omy agree­ments or us­ing Sin­ga­pore as a hub.”</p>
    <p>He also as­sured Sin­ga­pore­ans of the Gov­ern­ment’s com­mit­ment to pro­tect their jobs.</p>
    <p>In this re­gard, re­cent changes to salary re­quire­ments for Em­ploy­ment Passes (EP) and S Passes are a good move, he said.</p>
    <p>Since Sept 1, firms ap­ply­ing for new EPs for for­eign pro­fes­sion­als have to pay them at least $4,500 a month, up from $3,900. For mid­skilled for­eign­ers on S Passes, the qual­i­fy­ing salary will be raised from $2,400 to $2,500, start­ing from Oct 1 for new ap­pli­cants and May 1 next year for re­newal ap­pli­cants.</p>
    <p>“What we want to see is the abil­ity to dif­fer­en­ti­ate and also to be able to at­tract global tal­ent. Be­cause when we have that high cal­i­bre of tal­ent, we can col­lec­tively lift the en­tire labour force,” he said.</p>
    <p>“So I would urge ev­ery­one not to just look at the EP and S Pass changes as one mea­sure by them­selves, but as part of a slew of mea­sures the Gov­ern­ment is rolling out to pro­tect Sin­ga­porean jobs and – at the same time – level up and at­tract the best tal­ent to come here.”</p>
