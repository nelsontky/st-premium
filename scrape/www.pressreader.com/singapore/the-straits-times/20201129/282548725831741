    <p>The big­gest myth about over­spend­ing is that it is a prob­lem that usu­ally af­fects peo­ple who do not earn enough, yet the re­al­ity is that peo­ple on higher pay are more at risk of over­spend­ing.</p>
    <p>In­vest re­cently fea­tured three high-in­come earn­ers who separately ended up with over $2 mil­lion debt each even though their monthly salaries were about $30,000.</p>
    <p>They de­clined to be in­ter­viewed for this fea­ture.</p>
    <p>In­stead, Janet (not her real name), a 50-year-old fi­nance in­dus­try pro­fes­sional who earns about $10,000 a month, is will­ing to share her plight on how she ended up with a debt of more than $250,000 on eight credit cards.</p>
    <p>She ended up with such a moun­tain­ous debt be­cause she over­spent on sev­eral big-ticket items, in­clud­ing a car, home ren­o­va­tion as well as sev­eral over­seas hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>As she did not have enough cash, most of the ex­penses were paid on credit.</p>
    <p>“In hind­sight, I should have cut back and saved more cash</p>
    <p>in­stead,” she says.</p>
    <p>Like many who over­spend, Janet did not re­alise the trou­ble she was in and con­tin­ued with her life as nor­mal. Her fam­ily was bliss­fully un­aware too.</p>
    <p>But the pres­sure started to rise when she re­alised that she could not keep up with re­pay­ments, which made the debt grow big­ger with the monthly in­ter­est charged.</p>
    <p>“I did not in­form any fam­ily mem­bers as I did not want them to worry. There are chil­dren and the el­derly folk at home.”</p>
    <p>Help came for Janet when she read a re­port in The Straits Times on how Credit Coun­selling Sin­ga­pore (CCS) helped debtors re­solve their prob­lems through a dis­ci­plined re­pay­ment sched­ule.</p>
    <p>That made her turn to CCS for help. CCS coun­sel­lors went through her fi­nances and pro­posed a rea­son­able re­pay­ment sched­ule to pay all the banks.</p>
    <p>“I am re­lieved to be given a struc­tured re­pay­ment scheme, with a re­duced in­ter­est rate. After work­ing out the monthly re­pay­ment, there is still spare cash to spend on ne­ces­si­ties for my fam­ily.”</p>
    <p>Janet is still on the debt man­age­ment pro­gramme. Every month, as soon as her salary is banked into her ac­count, she with­draws a sub­stan­tial por­tion to pay all her cred­i­tors.</p>
    <p>She makes a record of all pay­ments so that she does not end up “los­ing cred­i­bil­ity” for fail­ing to pay any­one, she says.</p>
    <p>“More im­por­tantly, I do not have ac­cess to any credit fa­cil­ity now to roll over the debt as the in­ter­est rate can be a killer,” she says.</p>
    <p>While she still has a long way to go as her debt is sub­stan­tial, she looks for­ward to the day when she can be debt-free.</p>
    <p>She says she has learnt valu­able lessons from her or­deal. “Do not think that if one earns a good salary, you can spend freely. If you want to spend on credit, make sure you pay on time, full pay­ment and not just the min­i­mum sum.”</p>
    <p>While she has given up all her credit cards dur­ing the CCS pro­gramme, she said she will not hold more than two cards in fu­ture – one for her per­sonal ex­penses and the other for fam­ily ex­penses. Pay­ments for both cards will be set­tled in full every month.</p>
    <p>Her ad­vice for high-in­come earn­ers who over­spend: “Do not feel shame or fear. There is help from par­ties like CCS who work with banks to struc­ture a work­able plan on re­pay­ment. This works so long as you have the dis­ci­pline not to fall back to old habits.”</p>
