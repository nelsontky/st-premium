    <p>Lawyer Lee Suet Fern’s “sin­gu­lar fo­cus” in achiev­ing what her hus­band Lee Hsien Yang wanted, obliv­i­ous to the in­ter­ests of her fa­ther-in-law Lee Kuan Yew, was a fac­tor that weighed in favour of a heav­ier sen­tence.</p>
    <p>Not hav­ing due re­gard for Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s in­ter­ests was a “grave fail­ure” on Mrs Lee’s part, a Court of Three Judges said in its judg­ment yes­ter­day as it set out the var­i­ous fac­tors that it con­sid­ered in de­cid­ing to sus­pend her from prac­tis­ing law for 15 months af­ter find­ing her guilty of mis­con­duct over her han­dling of the late Mr Lee’s last will.</p>
    <p>The prepa­ra­tion of a will is not just a rou­tine ex­er­cise in form fill­ing, said the court.</p>
    <p>A lawyer who is tasked to pre­pare and at­tend to a will has se­ri­ous re­spon­si­bil­i­ties and should con­sci­en­tiously avoid be­ing in any sit­u­a­tion where even a po­ten­tial con­flict of in­ter­est may ap­pear to ex­ist, said the court.</p>
    <p>“A so­lic­i­tor who fails to act with ex­cep­tional care and... with re­straint and cir­cum­spec­tion must be pre­pared to have her con­duct scru­ti­nised and, per­haps, even her mo­tives called into ques­tion,” said the judg­ment writ­ten by</p>
    <p>Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon.</p>
    <p>While the court ac­cepted that there was no so­lic­i­tor-client re­la­tion­ship be­tween Mrs Lee and her fa­ther-in-law, it said the cur­rent case was anal­o­gous to cases in­volv­ing lawyers who pre­fer their own in­ter­ests over those of their clients.</p>
    <p>Given the ab­sence of a so­lic­i­tor-client re­la­tion­ship, the pre­sump­tive penalty of strik­ing off would be dis­pro­por­tion­ate, said the court.</p>
    <p>“None­the­less, the sanc­tion that is im­posed on (Mrs Lee) should re­flect both her cul­pa­bil­ity and the harm caused by her mis­con­duct,” said the court.</p>
    <p>On the af­ter­noon of Dec 16, 2013, Mrs Lee’s hus­band Lee Hsien Yang, who was go­ing over­seas that evening, told her to make ar­range­ments for the se­nior Mr Lee to re­vert to his orig­i­nal 2011 will.</p>
    <p>The court said that upon be­ing told this, Mrs Lee was well aware that she was in a po­si­tion of po­ten­tial con­flict as her hus­band had been a sig­nif­i­cant ben­e­fi­ciary un­der that will.</p>
    <p>De­spite this, she set about lo­cat­ing a draft of that will and sent it to the se­nior Mr Lee, telling him that it was the first will he had ex­e­cuted in Au­gust 2011.</p>
    <p>The court said Mrs Lee was so fo­cused on what her hus­band wanted done that she did not check with Mr Lee Kuan Yew to en­sure that he in­deed wished to re­vert to that will.</p>
    <p>She also sent the draft will to her fa­ther-in-law with­out even check­ing whether it was the fi­nal draft of the first will.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the last will was ex­e­cuted, Mrs Lee asked her hus­band, rather than her fa­ther-in-law, what she should do with the two orig­i­nal copies of it.</p>
    <p>The court said her “re­mark­able lack of dili­gence” in en­sur­ing that her fa­ther-in-law’s wishes were prop­erly as­cer­tained and that he was fully ap­prised of all the facts also weighed in favour of a heav­ier sen­tence.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lee’s ex­pe­ri­ence of more than 30 years also weighed against her.</p>
    <p>“While this was the first blem­ish in the course of a long ca­reer, her sig­nif­i­cant ex­pe­ri­ence ren­dered her con­duct wholly un­ac­cept­able and in­ex­cus­able,” said the court.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, the court found that the lack of dis­hon­esty in her deal­ings with Mr Lee Kuan Yew was a fac­tor in Mrs Lee’s favour.</p>
    <p>While the court said Mrs Lee was “clearly im­pru­dent” and “grossly neg­li­gent”, it noted that she had tes­ti­fied that she would not have dared send out the draft will if she did not think that was what her fa­ther-in-law wanted.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the weight to be placed on this fac­tor is less­ened by the fact that she acted with a de­gree of dis­hon­esty in the dis­ci­plinary pro­ceed­ings by giv­ing a “con­trived and ul­ti­mately un­true ac­count” of her role in the prepa­ra­tion and ex­e­cu­tion of the will.</p>
    <p>Con­sid­er­ing all these fac­tors, Mrs Lee’s cul­pa­bil­ity was at least “mod­er­ately high”, the court said.</p>
    <p>It added that ma­te­rial harm was caused be­cause Mr Lee Kuan Yew ended up sign­ing a doc­u­ment which was in fact not the one that he had in­di­cated he wished to sign.</p>
    <p>“The fact that the last will and the first will were ma­te­ri­ally sim­i­lar was for­tu­itous and does not dis­count the fact that the po­ten­tial harm could have been far more se­vere than the ac­tual harm that even­tu­ated,” said the court.</p>
    <p>It noted that while Mr Lee Kuan Yew had changed his will sev­eral times, he was con­tent with the last will af­ter it was signed and lived with it for more than a year and did not re­visit it, apart from be­queath­ing two car­pets to Mr Lee Hsien Yang.</p>
    <p>The harm caused in this case was “at the lower end of the mod­er­ate range”, it said, adding that a sub­stan­tial pe­riod of sus­pen­sion was war­ranted in this case.</p>
    <p>Be­fore de­ter­min­ing the ap­pro­pri­ate pe­riod of sus­pen­sion to im­pose, the court looked at three prece­dents in which the er­rant lawyers in­volved were sus­pended for be­tween two and three years in cases in­volv­ing a con­flict of in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>Com­par­ing the facts of the cur­rent case with the prece­dents, the court said a 15-month sus­pen­sion was ap­pro­pri­ate.</p>
