    <p>Par­ents of Sin­ga­porean chil­dren born be­tween Oct 1 this year and Sept 30, 2022, can get a one-off $3,000 grant to help them de­fray the cost of rais­ing a child amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Baby Sup­port Grant will sup­ple­ment the ex­ist­ing Baby Bonus cash gift – which can be as much as $10,000 – and will be de­posited into the same bank ac­count par­ents have nom­i­nated for the cash gift.</p>
    <p>Pay­ments will start from April 1 next year or within one month of en­rol­ment i n the Baby Bonus scheme, whichever is later.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice In­dra­nee Ra­jah, who an­nounced the grant at a vir­tual me­dia con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, noted that the Covid-19 pan­demic has not been easy on Sin­ga­pore­ans plan­ning to wed and start fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>While the Gov­ern­ment has en­hanced sup­port for mar­riage and par­ent­hood on many dif­fer­ent fronts, com­mit­ting $4 bil­lion an­nu­ally to the Mar­riage and Par­ent­hood Pack­age, this year has been es­pe­cially chal­leng­ing for many young cou­ples, she said.</p>
    <p>“The Covid-19 pan­demic has af­fected lives and liveli­hoods, and some Sin­ga­pore­ans are de­lay­ing their mar­riage and par­ent­hood plans as a re­sult of in­se­cu­rity about jobs and in­comes,” said Ms In­dra­nee, who oversees the Na­tional Pop­u­la­tion and Tal­ent Di­vi­sion (NPTD).</p>
    <p>The Baby Sup­port Grant will give a fur­ther boost to coax­ing cou­ples not to de­lay their plans to get hitched and start a fam­ily, she added, not­ing that a re­cent sur­vey shows some cou­ples will post­pone their life plans ow­ing to con­cerns about their fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity and em­ploy­ment prospects</p>
    <p>“The Gov­ern­ment will spare no ef­fort to help cou­ples meet their mar­riage and par­ent­hood as­pi­ra­tions,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms In­dra­nee also said that ev­ery seg­ment of so­ci­ety plays an im­por­tant role in sup­port­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans on their par­ent­hood jour­ney, in­clud­ing em­ploy­ers and busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>The NPTD, which ad­min­is­ters the Baby Sup­port Grant with the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment, said it un­der­stands the dis­ap­point­ment of some par­ents in miss­ing out on the new grant be­cause of the start date.</p>
    <p>“We would like to seek the pub­lic’s un­der­stand­ing that spe­cific start dates are needed for any new mea­sure or en­hance­ment,” it added, not­ing that chil­dren born be­fore Oct 1 this year can still en­joy the many ben­e­fits in the Mar­riage and Par­ent­hood Pack­age.</p>
    <p>Ms In­dra­nee fur­ther said that while the Gov­ern­ment is not able to pre­dict when the pan­demic will end, the grant’s du­ra­tion is for two years, which is deemed to be a rea­son­able pe­riod of time.</p>
    <p>It will be re­viewed at the end of the pe­riod to see if it is still rel­e­vant and use­ful, she added.</p>
    <p>Guest ser­vices of­fi­cer Grace Tng, 37, who is ex­pect­ing to de­liver her sec­ond son on Oct 24, is glad she and her cabby hus­band will get more fi­nan­cial sup­port. “His in­come has been af­fected by Covid-19, and I have been wor­ried over whether we can cope with the costs of hav­ing our sec­ond child. This $3,000 will come in handy for child­care, di­a­pers, fresh food and other es­sen­tials,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mr Jeremy Au, 33, who re­turned home from the United States with his preg­nant wife in March and is ex­pect­ing a daughter in De­cem­ber, also cheered the news. He and his wife faced a “pretty lonely par­ent­hood jour­ney” amid Covid-19 re­stric­tions, which meant they could not at­tend birthing classes, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>“I def­i­nitely feel sup­ported by this ac­knowl­edge­ment of the fi­nan­cial and psy­cho­log­i­cal dif­fi­cul­ties we face amid the pan­demic,” said Mr Au, who is build­ing his own start-up af­ter quit­ting his job as the ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of an Amer­i­can education firm.</p>
