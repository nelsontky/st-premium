    <p>Ever walked into some­one’s home and wished you could buy an ex­act piece of his or her decor? At the up­com­ing ex­pe­ri­en­tial pop-up The Time Cap­sule, you can.</p>
    <p>Housed in a showflat for lux­ury con­do­minium The Ive­ria by Ove, the jour­ney be­gins at the front door.</p>
    <p>Walk­ing through, shop­pers will find the flat’s three bed­rooms and study kit­ted out with life­style items from some 35 lo­cal brands, cu­rated ac­cord­ing to the rooms.</p>
    <p>The Grand Liv­ing Room brings to­gether pieces like vases, ce­ramic plates and cush­ions. You will find leather-bound note­books from Bynd Artisan in the Power Study and sheets from Sun­day Bed­ding in the bed­rooms.</p>
    <p>A space called The Gar­den Room will fea­ture art­works by lo­cal botan­i­cal artist Lucinda Law.</p>
    <p>Reg­is­tra­tion is re­quired, with a max­i­mum of 15 peo­ple a slot.</p>
    <p>Be­hind the ex­pe­ri­ence is fash­ion de­signer Phuay Li Ying (of Ying The La­bel) and life­style prop­erty de­vel­oper Joan Chang, 30, who runs bou­tique ho­tel Lloyd’s Inn.</p>
    <p>The en­tire con­cept is about stepping out of one’s own home and into an­other, Ms Phuay, 31, says.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to place the brands within spa­ces of the home, so peo­ple don’t feel like they’re just shop­ping at a booth or a mall. They are able to re­alise that some of these items can be a part of their life.”</p>
    <p>It was also the perfect op­por­tu­nity for Ms Chang to of­fi­cially de­but her new brand of mod­ern lux­ury con­do­mini­ums in River Val­ley.</p>
    <p>And with the new work-fromhome nor­mal, cu­rat­ing prod­ucts within a home makes for re­lat­able vis­ual mer­chan­dis­ing, adds Ms Phuay.</p>
    <p>Shop­pers will be given a slip of pa­per to mark the items they wish to pur­chase, be­fore they pick them up and make pay­ment at the end of the walk-through – a con­cept Ms Phuay de­scribes as “Ikeast­yle”.</p>
    <p>She had been toy­ing with the idea for a few months, af­ter ex­plor­ing col­lab­o­ra­tions with ho­tels to fea­ture the wa­ter­colour art her cloth­ing is known for in their rooms.</p>
    <p>While that fell through, it gave her the in­spi­ra­tion to in­cor­po­rate art – and retail – into daily life.</p>
    <p>“Cus­tomers tell me they wish there was more brand story when they en­ter a store, so I’m al­ways think­ing of how to give ex­pe­ri­ence to peo­ple and con­vey brand sto­ries as part of their life­style,” says Ms Phuay.</p>
    <p>“I still feel that touch points for cus­tomers are very im­por­tant. We used to have the big bou­tique fairs where shop­pers were al­ways very ex­cited to touch and feel.</p>
    <p>“The hu­man touch is an im­por­tant el­e­ment and we can’t forgo it.”</p>

    <p>58 Kim Yam Road</p>
    <p>When: Dec 4 and 5, 11am to 9pm; Dec 6, 11am to 5pm</p>
