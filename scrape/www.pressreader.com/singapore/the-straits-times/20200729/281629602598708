    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong re­ceived a phone call from In­done­sian Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo yes­ter­day, con­grat­u­lat­ing him on the re­sult of the re­cent Sin­ga­pore gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs, the two lead­ers reaf­firmed the ex­cel­lent ties between their coun­tries dur­ing their con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>They also said that they looked for­ward to con­tin­ued bi­lat­eral and re­gional co­op­er­a­tion to ad­dress com­mon chal­lenges aris­ing from the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>PM Lee also re­ceived a mes­sage from Chi­nese Premier Li Ke­qiang con­grat­u­lat­ing him on his reap­point­ment as Sin­ga­pore’s prime min­is­ter, re­ported news agency Xin­hua.</p>
    <p>In his mes­sage on Mon­day, Mr Li said that un­der PM Lee’s lead­er­ship, Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy has main­tained a good mo­men­tum for a long pe­riod of time. The Premier also praised the mea­sures taken by the is­land state to deal with the coro­n­avirus, say­ing they were de­ci­sive and achieved pos­i­tive re­sults in epi­demic preven­tion and con­trol, and eco­nomic and so­cial re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing the two coun­tries as “friendly neigh­bours”, Mr Li said he is will­ing to work with his Sin­ga­pore coun­ter­part to co­or­di­nate ef­forts in the fight against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>He said Sin­ga­pore and China should co­op­er­ate on devel­op­ment, in­clud­ing projects un­der the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive, and deepen their re­la­tion­ship as they mark the 30th an­niver­sary of bi­lat­eral diplo­matic re­la­tions this year.</p>
