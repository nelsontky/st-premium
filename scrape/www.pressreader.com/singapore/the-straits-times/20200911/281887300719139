    <p>Se­nior of­fi­cials from the Euro­pean Union are in London for emer­gency talks de­signed to avert a cat­a­strophic col­lapse in trust be­tween Bri­tain and the EU, af­ter the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment an­nounced plans to vi­o­late a treaty gov­ern­ing re­la­tions be­tween Bri­tain and Europe.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean ne­go­tia­tors still hope to avoid a ma­jor show­down. The Bri­tish threat to ig­nore treaty obli­ga­tions only kicks in should London and the con­ti­nent fail to reach a broader agree­ment about their trade re­la­tions by the end of this year.</p>
    <p>Nonethe­less, of­fi­cials in Brussels, the EU cap­i­tal, are now threat­en­ing le­gal ac­tion against the United King­dom. And every­where, politi­cians are strug­gling to hide their as­ton­ish­ment at the fact that a coun­try such as Bri­tain now plans to flout an in­ter­na­tional treaty it signed only up to a few months ago.</p>
    <p>“The UK gov­ern­ment is not only gam­bling with the fu­ture of mil­lions of UK and EU cit­i­zens,” warned Mr Christophe Hansen, the EU law­maker whose job is to steer any trade deal with Bri­tain through the Euro­pean Par­lia­ment. “It is also putting at risk its in­ter­na­tional cred­i­bil­ity at an alarm­ing pace.”</p>
    <p>Bri­tain ceased to be a mem­ber of the EU at the end of Jan­uary, based on a treaty which spec­i­fies the broad out­lines of its fu­ture re­la­tion­ship with the con­ti­nent.</p>
    <p>The With­drawal Agree­ment was de­signed as a pre­lude to a com­pre­hen­sive trade deal that the two par­ties are cur­rently ne­go­ti­at­ing. But both London and Brussels agreed that, even if they fail to bridge their dif­fer­ences over trade, the treaty con­cluded be­tween them stands.</p>
    <p>One of the treaty’s thorni­est as­pects was the ques­tion of North­ern Ire­land – it re­mains part of the UK but shares a bor­der with Ire­land, which re­mains a mem­ber of the EU. This is the only land bor­der be­tween Bri­tain and the EU. That bor­der did not mat­ter as long as both the Bri­tish and the Ir­ish re­mained in the EU. But now, bor­der checks must be in­sti­tuted, since oth­er­wise, Bri­tish goods would be able to flow un­hin­dered into the EU.</p>
    <p>The snag is that, as part of an agree­ment which ended decades of re­li­gious blood­shed be­tween Catholics and Protes­tants in North­ern Ire­land, Bri­tain and Ire­land vowed to make the bor­der be­tween them ir­rel­e­vant, by hav­ing no checks there.</p>
    <p>So once Bri­tain left the EU, there were only two op­tions: Ei­ther the whole of Bri­tain re­mained in the EU trad­ing area, which would have made a mock­ery of leav­ing the EU in the first place, or North­ern Ire­land re­mained part of the EU’s trad­ing area, and Cus­toms checks would be im­posed within the UK, be­tween North­ern Ire­land and the rest of the Bri­tish mar­ket.</p>
    <p>London ac­cepted the lat­ter op­tion in the hope that the cu­ri­ous idea of hav­ing in­ter­nal Cus­toms con­trols would not mat­ter if Bri­tain con­cluded a free trade deal with the EU.</p>
    <p>But with trade talks stalled, the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment has in­tro­duced leg­is­la­tion which gives its min­is­ters pow­ers to wave off these Cus­toms con­trols with North­ern Ire­land, in di­rect breach of the pro­vi­sions of the With­drawal Agree­ment.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish did not even bother to pre­tend that they were merely adopt­ing a dif­fer­ent in­ter­pre­ta­tion of the treaty. As Mr Bran­don Lewis, the Bri­tish min­is­ter re­spon­si­ble for North­ern Ire­land, breezily ad­mit­ted to Par­lia­ment in London early this week, the pro­posal does in­deed “break in­ter­na­tional law” al­though, as he put it, “in a spe­cific and lim­ited way”.</p>
    <p>The move raised a storm of protest in London and prompted the res­ig­na­tion of the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment’s own top le­gal of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>It also shook the EU to the core, be­cause it serves as a warn­ing that the gov­ern­ment of Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son may not only be un­trust­wor­thy, but also that it will stop at noth­ing in pur­suit of its pop­ulist anti-EU agenda, even if this con­demns Bri­tain to decades of trade wars with the con­ti­nent.</p>
    <p>London’s claim that Mr John­son did not fully un­der­stand what he was agree­ing to in the treaty with the EU cuts even less ice with EU lead­ers.</p>
    <p>“The With­drawal Agree­ment is not open for rene­go­ti­a­tion”, said Mr Maros Se­f­covic, vice-pres­i­dent of the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion, the EU’s ex­ec­u­tive. He has ac­ti­vated the emer­gency con­flict-res­o­lu­tion pro­ce­dures in­cluded in the treaty with Bri­tain. The com­mis­sion is also look­ing at the pos­si­bil­ity of tak­ing Bri­tain to court.</p>
    <p>But a court ver­dict would take years. And if the John­son gov­ern­ment is de­ter­mined to break the treaty, there is lit­tle to stop it. Yet, the costs will be steep. As for­mer prime min­is­ter John Ma­jor told the peo­ple of Bri­tain this week: “If we lose our rep­u­ta­tion for hon­our­ing the prom­ises we make, we will have lost some­thing be­yond price that may never be re­gained.”</p>
