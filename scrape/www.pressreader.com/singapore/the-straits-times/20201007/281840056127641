    <p>WASHINGTON • De­spite al­most daily dis­clo­sures of new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions among US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s close as­so­ciates, the White House is mak­ing lit­tle ef­fort to in­ves­ti­gate the scope and source of its out­break.</p>
    <p>The White House has de­cided not to trace the con­tacts of guests and staff mem­bers at the Sept 26 Rose Gar­den cel­e­bra­tion for Judge Amy Coney Bar­rett, where at least eight peo­ple, in­clud­ing the Pres­i­dent, may have be­come in­fected, ac­cord­ing to a White House of­fi­cial fa­mil­iar with the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>In­stead, it has lim­ited its ef­forts to no­ti­fy­ing peo­ple who came in close con­tact with Mr Trump in the two days be­fore his Covid-19 di­ag­no­sis last Thurs­day evening. It has also cut the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion (CDC), which has the gov­ern­ment’s most ex­ten­sive knowl­edge and re­sources for con­tact trac­ing, out of the process.</p>
    <p>Con­tact trac­ing is an es­sen­tial piece of any out­break in­ves­ti­ga­tion and is a key to stop­ping the virus from spread­ing fur­ther, es­pe­cially af­ter a po­ten­tial “su­per­spreader” event where many peo­ple may have been in­fected.</p>
    <p>Any of the closely packed guests and staff mem­bers at the Rose Gar­den event could have gone on to trans­mit the virus to many oth­ers, so the White House’s de­ci­sion not to in­ves­ti­gate the clus­ter of in­fec­tions, and pin­point the source, has po­ten­tially dev­as­tat­ing im­pact for hun­dreds of peo­ple, said ex­perts.</p>
    <p>“This is a to­tal ab­di­ca­tion of re­spon­si­bil­ity by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion,” said Dr Joshua Baro­cas, a pub­lic health ex­pert at Bos­ton Univer­sity. “The idea that we’re not in­volv­ing the CDC to do con­tact trac­ing at this point seems like a mas­sive pub­lic health threat.”</p>
    <p>The White House of­fi­cial, who de­clined to be iden­ti­fied, said it was fol­low­ing CDC guide­lines that rec­om­mend fo­cus­ing on con­tacts within a two-day win­dow from di­ag­no­sis. But pub­lic health ex­perts said it was ir­re­spon­si­ble to ig­nore the gath­er­ing at the Rose Gar­den.</p>
    <p>“You can­not ar­gue against the fact that five or six peo­ple who at­tended that event all got in­fected, un­less you ar­gue that was all ran­dom chance,” said Dr Yvonne Mal­don­ado, an epi­demi­ol­o­gist and con­tact trac­ing ex­pert.</p>
    <p>Even the con­tact trac­ing ef­forts within the two-day win­dow have been lim­ited, con­sist­ing mostly of e-mails no­ti­fy­ing peo­ple of po­ten­tial ex­po­sure, rather than the de­tailed phone calls to warn any­one who may have been ex­posed, coach them on which symp­toms to look for and coun­sel them to iso­late if they do be­gin to show symp­toms.</p>
    <p>“I guess an e-mail is no­ti­fi­ca­tion of ex­po­sure,” said Ms Erin San­ders, a nurse prac­ti­tioner and cer­ti­fied con­tact tracer in Bos­ton. “But that is not con­tact trac­ing,” she said, “and not how a re­spon­si­ble pub­lic health agency han­dles a su­per-spread­ing clus­ter of a deadly virus.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter Mr Trump’s ill­ness was di­ag­nosed, an in­ter­nal CDC e-mail last Fri­day asked its sci­en­tists to be ready to go to Washington for con­tact trac­ing, but a re­quest from the White House for help never came, said two senior CDC sci­en­tists.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the trac­ing ef­forts are be­ing run by the White House Med­i­cal Unit, a group of about 30 doc­tors, nurses and physi­cian as­sis­tants, headed by Dr Sean Con­ley, the White House physi­cian, who has been the pub­lic spokesman for Mr Trump’s doc­tors.</p>
