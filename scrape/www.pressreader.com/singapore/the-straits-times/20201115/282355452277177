    <p>FIC­TION SUM­MER</p>
    <p>By Ali Smith</p>
    <p>Hamish Hamil­ton/Pa­per­back/ 385 pages/$32.10/</p>
    <p>Avail­able at bit.ly/Sum­mer_AS</p>
    <p>A boy tells his sis­ter that he will give her a present for the fu­ture. While her eyes are closed, he su­per­glues an hour­glass to her hand and runs away.</p>
    <p>He texts her later, “from now on u al­ways have time on ur hands”.</p>
    <p>Scot­tish writer Ali Smith’s Brexit sea­sonal quar­tet of nov­els has al­ways had a mar­vel­lous re­la­tion­ship with time – pressed up against the present and free­wheel­ing through the past all at once.</p>
    <p>“Time is more than one thing,”</p>
    <p>she writes, “time is now and an­cient, time is be­fore and after, time is smooth and rough and if you try to re­move your at­tach­ment to time, time will laugh out loud and take the skin off you.”</p>
    <p>Sum­mer closes what Smith be­gan with Au­tumn – rushed out in 2016 to lay claim to be­ing the first post-Brexit novel – fol­lowed by Win­ter (2017) and Spring (2019).</p>
    <p>With Sum­mer, her most am­bi­tiously timely novel to date – it seems to have been writ­ten in the sum­mer of the world’s Covid-19 lock­down and ends with a let­ter dated July 1, 2020 – she goes out in a blaze of glory.</p>
    <p>The sib­lings who ex­change the timely gift of the hour­glass are Sacha and Robert Green­law. Sacha, 16, has lib­eral ideals and cli­mate anx­i­ety, be­friends home­less men and writes let­ters to refugees in de­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>Robert, 13, is at the cross­roads of be­com­ing ei­ther a ge­nius or an “in­cel” (in­vol­un­tary celi­bate). His he­roes are sci­en­tist Al­bert Ein­stein and Bri­tish prime min­is­ter Boris John­son, one for his ded­i­ca­tion to es­tab­lish­ing fact, the other for his abil­ity to ma­nip­u­late it.</p>
    <p>While wild­fires burn across Aus­tralia, their di­vorced mother Grace dreams of a gen­tler sum­mer gone by, when she was a young ac­tress in The Win­ter’s Tale. Smith iron­i­cally deems this the most sum­mery of Shake­speare’s plays: “He in­fects things with win­ter pre­cisely so that he can have a sum­mer, make a merry tale come out of a sad one.”</p>
    <p>They are con­nected with char­ac­ters from the quar­tet: cen­te­nar­ian Daniel Gluck from Au­tumn, and blog­ger Art and his ex-girl­friend Char­lotte from Win­ter.</p>
    <p>Daniel’s de­men­tia re­turns him to his time in a Bri­tish in­tern­ment camp in World War II, his Ger­man fa­ther hav­ing been clas­si­fied as an “en­emy alien”. Smith draws lines be­tween this and Bri­tain’s present­day treat­ment of refugees.</p>
    <p>Art is con­sid­er­ing giv­ing up his blog, Art In Na­ture, given the pandemic, and re­nam­ing it Art In­er­tia.</p>
    <p>Smith packs so much into Sum­mer that it is a marvel it gets off the ground, but it does. She weaves to­gether the crises of the world – not just the ur­gent, like the pandemic, but also the older, deeper crises of xeno­pho­bia, mi­gra­tion and cli­mate change. She shows them to be an in­ter­locked col­lage, and does so with wit and warmth.</p>
    <p>“The English word for sum­mer comes from the Old English ‘sumor’, from the proto-Indo-Euro­pean root ‘sam’, mean­ing both ‘one’ and ‘to­gether’,” she writes.</p>
    <p>Her quar­tet has been that rare thing: a work of art that has kept pace with the times that forged it.</p>
    <p>I had thought it would end in the heat of apoc­a­lypse, but in­stead I am re­minded of how much light there is in the world.</p>
    <p>If you like this, read: Sweet Sor­row by David Nicholls (Hod­der & Stoughton, 2019, $17.95, avail­able at bit.ly/Sweet­Sor­row_DN). Charlie Lewis re­calls the sum­mer of his 16th year, when he was drafted into an ama­teur Shake­speare com­pany’s Romeo And Juliet and fell in love with its Juliet.</p>
