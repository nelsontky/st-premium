    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON The sprint to find a med­i­cal break­through to con­tain Covid-19 stum­bled this week, as a pair of phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal gi­ants work­ing on treat­ments and vac­cines suf­fered set­backs in the clinic.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Eli Lilly said en­rol­ment in a gov­ern­ment-spon­sored clin­i­cal trial of its an­ti­body ther­apy had been halted due to safety con­cerns. The news came less than a day af­ter Johnson & Johnson (J&J) said re­search on its ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cine was paused af­ter a study vol­un­teer fell ill.</p>
    <p>The de­vel­op­ments are likely to heighten wor­ries that the rush to find drugs to pre­vent and treat in­fec­tions is mov­ing too fast. Reg­u­la­tors and drug-mak­ers have faced ques­tions on whether po­lit­i­cal pres­sure was over­whelm­ing sci­en­tific rigour ahead of the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial election in the United States.</p>
    <p>Last week, US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, trail­ing in the polls, touted an­ti­body treat­ments as a cure, and his ad­min­is­tra­tion has pushed hard for the rapid ap­proval of the treat­ments and a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>But the trial com­pli­ca­tions are hap­pen­ing in an en­vi­ron­ment of in­tense scru­tiny, ex­ec­u­tives and in­dus­try ob­servers said, and the highly public na­ture of the hunt for vac­cines and treat­ments is mag­ni­fy­ing events that in other stud­ies would be con­sid­ered rou­tine.</p>
    <p>“I’m not sur­prised at all that these pauses are hap­pen­ing. Where I would be sur­prised is if they weren’t hap­pen­ing,” said Pro­fes­sor Greg Poland, direc­tor of the Vac­cine Re­search Group at the Mayo</p>
    <p>Clinic in Rochester, Min­nesota.</p>
    <p>J&J’s treat­ment was seen as a front run­ner in the vac­cine race. Along with ri­val shots by Pfizer and part­ner BioNTech, Moderna, and As­traZeneca and the Univer­sity of Ox­ford, its safety and ef­fec­tive­ness are be­ing stud­ied in a large trial. Hope for its ef­fec­tive­ness is high, as it is ex­pected to be de­liv­ered in a sin­gle dose. Some ri­val shots will re­quire a sec­ond in­jec­tion.</p>
    <p>J&J chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer Joseph Wolk said the firm does not know if the per­son who was sick­ened had re­ceived the vac­cine or a placebo. He said J&J is stick­ing to its devel­op­ment time­line and plans to be able to pro­duce one bil­lion doses a year.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­body is anx­ious to get a vac­cine to the pan­demic, for the right rea­sons,” Mr Wolk said. “But no­body is cut­ting cor­ners or sug­gest­ing that there be un­due pres­sure to make that hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>The stakes in a vac­cine trial are es­pe­cially high, since in­oc­u­la­tions are given to peo­ple of all ages, many of whom are other­wise healthy.</p>
    <p>Prof Poland said he had never seen a vac­cine trial un­der as much scru­tiny as Covid-19 tri­als. “No one wants to mis­step... The de­ci­sions we are mak­ing will af­fect our chil­dren, our par­ents, our fam­i­lies. We aren’t mak­ing de­ci­sions in a void.”</p>
    <p>Lilly’s drug is part of a class of ther­a­pies known as mon­o­clonal an­ti­bod­ies, which top US in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert An­thony Fauci has called a bridge to a vac­cine. Its an­ti­body treat­ment is sim­i­lar to one be­ing de­vel­oped by Re­gen­eron Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals that was given to Mr Trump af­ter he tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has cred­ited the Re­gen­eron drug for his quick re­cov­ery, and has vowed to make it and Lilly’s shot widely ac­ces­si­ble. This has put a spot­light on the two ther­a­pies.</p>
    <p>“Nor­mally this stuff never makes the news,” said Prof Poland. “This is un­der a mi­cro­scope and ev­ery sneeze and hic­cup gets re­ported.”</p>
