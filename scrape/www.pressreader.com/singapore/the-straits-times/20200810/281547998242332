    <p>Ex­pan­sion plans among co-work­ing space op­er­a­tors have been more muted this year, with some de­lays in the open­ing of new work cen­tres and a more sub­dued take-up of new spa­ces. How­ever, flex­i­ble workspaces are ex­pected to play a key role in many busi­nesses’ re­turn to work amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ex­pan­sion plans among co-work­ing space op­er­a­tors have been more muted this year, with the open­ing of new work cen­tres de­layed and a more sub­dued take-up of new spa­ces.</p>
    <p>But de­spite the quiet year thus far, co-work­ing spa­ces are ex­pected to play a key role in many busi­nesses’ re­turn to work amid the pan­demic, real es­tate firm Col­liers In­ter­na­tional noted in a re­port on the flex­i­ble workspace in­dus­try last month.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal op­er­a­tor JustCo, which has 17 co-work­ing spa­ces in Sin­ga­pore, is open­ing two new cen­tres – at OCBC Cen­tre East and The Cen­tre­point this month and in Oc­to­ber, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The launch of the cen­tres was de­layed by two to three months due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>While sev­eral firms said their plans to open more cen­tres or ex­pand ex­ist­ing spa­ces re­main on track, the gen­eral sen­ti­ment has been more cau­tious than the bullish ap­proach last year, when al­most 800,000 sq ft of new space was leased by op­er­a­tors of flex­i­ble workspaces.</p>
    <p>Op­er­a­tors are pre­dicted to take up around 200,000 sq ft of new space this year, given the sub­dued mar­ket, with new take-up ex­pected to be driven by part­ner­ships or man­age­ment agree­ments with as­set own­ers, Col­liers said.</p>
    <p>FALL IN OC­CU­PANCY</p>
    <p>Co-work­ing spa­ces are gen­er­ally mem­ber­ship-based of­fices where in­di­vid­u­als or busi­nesses lease ei­ther a hot-de­sk­ing seat, a per­ma­nent desk, or a small of­fice unit on flex­i­ble leases, rang­ing from a month to mul­ti­ple years.</p>
    <p>Some op­er­a­tors also of­fer ad­min­is­tra­tive and busi­ness ser­vices, and the use of event spa­ces as part of the mem­ber­ship.</p>
    <p>Amid the pan­demic, some co</p>
    <p>We have seen a drop in oc­cu­pancy due to mul­ti­ple small and medium-sized en­ter­prises that have ter­mi­nated their lease due to the Govern­ment’s work-from-home pol­icy, as well as the econ­omy im­pact­ing their rev­enue and not be­ing able to af­ford an of­fice space... Larger tra­di­tional of­fices are also look­ing for new solutions that are more flex­i­ble or cost-ef­fec­tive in­stead of the usual tra­di­tional of­fice lease.</p>
    <p>CHANG­ING NEEDS</p>
    <p>work­ing op­er­a­tors have seen their oc­cu­pancy – or the num­ber of mem­bers – fall. Oc­cu­pancy within flex­i­ble workspace lo­ca­tions was around 90 per cent last year, ac­cord­ing to Col­liers.</p>
    <p>At Distrii, which is lo­cated over seven floors at Repub­lic Plaza, oc­cu­pancy has fallen to about 80 per cent of ca­pac­ity, with some 900 mem­bers. Its oc­cu­pancy was about 90 per cent in Jan­uary, said Distrii Sin­ga­pore chief ex­ec­u­tive Jo Hu.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, Found8, which has five of­fices in Cen­tral Busi­ness District ar­eas, noted that it has seen a few mem­bers de­part over the last few months, although the num­bers are not sig­nif­i­cant.</p>
    <p>Mr Ryan Warner, coun­try man­ager for co-work­ing op­er­a­tor The Hive Sin­ga­pore, said: “We have seen a drop in oc­cu­pancy due to mul­ti­ple small and medium-sized en­ter­prises that have ter­mi­nated their lease due to the Govern­ment’s work-from-home pol­icy, as well as the econ­omy im­pact­ing their rev­enue and not be­ing able to af­ford an of­fice space.”</p>
    <p>But sev­eral new mem­bers have taken up hot-de­sk­ing seats as they are un­able to work from home ef­fec­tively.</p>
    <p>“Larger tra­di­tional of­fices are also look­ing for new solutions that are more flex­i­ble or cost-ef­fec­tive in­stead of the usual tra­di­tional of­fice lease,” Mr Warner said.</p>
    <p>Some of the larger play­ers, like WeWork, said that mem­ber­ship has been con­sis­tent, with the busi­ness user seg­ment in South-east Asia in­creas­ing by 11 per cent from March to last month.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age mem­ber­ship pe­riod</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>MR RYAN WARNER, coun­try man­ager for co-work­ing op­er­a­tor The Hive Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>for a WeWork user in Sin­ga­pore is about one to two years, a spokesman said.</p>
    <p>CON­CES­SIONS, SUP­PORT FOR TEN­ANTS</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, a few co-work­ing play­ers pro­vided re­lief to ten­ants.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, The Work­ing Capi­tol pro­vided rental cred­its of be­tween 15 and 30 per cent in April, and be­tween 30 and 50 per cent in May, while JR East Sin­ga­pore’s One&Co pro­vided around 30 per cent re­bates to its mem­bers dur­ing those two months.</p>
    <p>Found8 growth mar­ket­ing man­ager Laura Fitzpatric­k said the firm im­ple­mented a 30 per cent mem­ber­ship re­lief in May and June, and 40 per cent last month.</p>
    <p>Some op­er­a­tors have im­ple­mented pro­mo­tions and new mem­ber­ship op­tions to draw ten­ants.</p>
    <p>The Hive, for one, is of­fer­ing new mem­bers a 40 per cent dis­count for the first four months, and pro­vides them with a sep­a­rate of­fice at its lo­ca­tion in New Bridge Road if they take up an of­fice at its Car­pen­ter Street space.</p>
    <p>OP­POR­TU­NI­TIES FOR CO-WORK­ING SPA­CES</p>
    <p>Co-work­ing op­er­a­tors are op­ti­mistic about de­mand for flex­i­ble workspaces.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for One&Co said that it has seen an in­crease in de­mand from com­pa­nies and in­di­vid­u­als who are seek­ing to re­duce the size of their phys­i­cal of­fices, as well as greater lease term flex­i­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>WeWork head of growth for South-east Asia and South Korea Ray Tan said firms will want to ex­plore stag­gered or phased ap­proaches of re­turn­ing to work to com­ply with safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>A flex­i­ble l ease term is also some­thing that at­tracts com­pa­nies, he said, adding: “Some sec­tors that have been greatly im­pacted dur­ing this phase are focused on con­sol­i­dat­ing their pres­ence within WeWork to sup­port cur­rent oper­a­tions, with hopes of ex­pan­sion in the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>By tak­ing up a scal­able space, they are able to ad­dress both their cur­rent needs and fu­ture ex­pan­sion pos­si­bil­i­ties, Mr Tan said.</p>
