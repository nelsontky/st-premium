    <p>PE­TAL­ING JAYA • Malaysian fam­i­lies are opt­ing to scale down their Chi­nese New Year cel­e­bra­tions in the light of the ram­pant spread of Covid-19 in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>This year’s fes­tiv­i­ties will be sim­ple af­fairs as they limit so­cial vis­its, avoid large gath­er­ings and get take­aways for the all-im­por­tant re­union din­ner.</p>
    <p>Ms Chris­tine Koh, 37, from Me­laka, said that un­like in pre­vi­ous years, she would limit her vis­its to close fam­ily mem­bers. “Vir­tual vis­its are not work­able for the older gen­er­a­tion, so I may con­sider de­liv­er­ing gifts or ham­pers as an al­ter­na­tive,” said the mother of three.</p>
    <p>Ms Koh, who is the vice-pres­i­dent of her pri­mary school alumni as­so­ci­a­tion, said she and her com­mit­tee were plan­ning a vir­tual get­to­gether with on­line in­ter­ac­tive games this year. “Although we have to min­imise phys­i­cal con­tact with our loved ones and as­so­ciates, it doesn’t mean we can­not cher­ish each other’s pres­ence this fes­tive sea­son,” she added.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness­man Chong Ming Huei, 40, who had been in Sin­ga­pore be­fore the move­ment curbs be­gan last March, has de­cided not to re­turn for the fes­tive cel­e­bra­tion.</p>
    <p>“I have been video-call­ing my mum and dad back home ev­ery day since I came here. So, on the first day of Chi­nese New Year, I will do the same be­fore meet­ing up with my cousins here,” he said.</p>
    <p>As for his par­ents in Me­laka, Mr Chong said it will be a closed-door Chi­nese New Year cel­e­bra­tion, as they have made it a point to in­form rel­a­tives, friends and as­so­ciates to re­frain from vis­it­ing.</p>
    <p>“My par­ents are in their 70s and not tak­ing any chances,” he added.</p>
    <p>Con­sul­tant Y.S. Lee, 56, said he will be opt­ing for take­away food from restau­rants for his re­union din­ner. “We will have only close fam­ily mem­bers din­ing at home, es­pe­cially since my mother is el­derly and at high risk. We will most likely not in­vite other rel­a­tives. We don’t mind if a few peo­ple drop by, but for us to go vis­it­ing with my mother, I think it’s bet­ter not to do that,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor Chi­nese groups in the coun­try have also im­plored those cel­e­brat­ing the Chi­nese New Year next month to re­strict their vis­its and gath­er­ings, in view of the four­fig­ure num­ber of daily Covid-19 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Fed­er­a­tion of Chi­nese As­so­ci­a­tions Malaysia (Hua­zong) pres­i­dent Goh Tian Chuan said it is a must for all to pri­ori­tise lives and public health.</p>
    <p>“We must be vig­i­lant and re­spon­si­ble while cel­e­brat­ing, es­pe­cially if we have chil­dren and the el­derly at home. So, for all who are mark­ing the Chi­nese New Year, we must fol­low the SOP (stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dure) to flat­ten the curve again,” he said.</p>
