    <p>EX­CIT­ING OP­POR­TU­NITY</p>
    <p>Last year, Ms Ch­eryl Tan de­cided to take up an in­tern­ship in her fi­nal year of stud­ies at Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity, de­lay­ing her grad­u­a­tion by six months.</p>
    <p>The 24-year-old thought tak­ing up the in­tern­ship op­por­tu­nity in mar­ket­ing would help her gain some ex­pe­ri­ence and set her apart from her peers in her even­tual job search. But two months af­ter grad­u­at­ing in Jan­uary, the coro­n­avirus pan­demic hit Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan, who has a bach­e­lor’s de­gree in so­cial sciences, with a sec­ond ma­jor in mar­ket­ing, was forced to put her job search on pause.</p>
    <p>It was only dur­ing phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing in mid-July that she was able to restart her job search, but com­pe­ti­tion was stiff.</p>
    <p>“The job mar­ket was re­ally sat­u­rated, be­cause peo­ple with years of ex­pe­ri­ence were also com­pet­ing for the same jobs with fresh grad­u­ates like my­self,” she said.</p>
    <p>Af­ter hear­ing about the SGUnited Trainee­ships Pro­gramme from a friend, she ap­plied to be an e-com­merce trainee at home-grown jew­ellery re­tailer SK Jew­ellery for 12 months.</p>
    <p>“It was a com­bi­na­tion of work­ing in lux­ury re­tail and e-com­merce, which I had al­ways been in­ter­ested in but never had the op­por­tu­nity to branch into, so I was re­ally ex­cited,” she added.</p>
    <p>In July, she was the first to join the com­pany un­der the pro­gramme, which pro­vides her with an al­lowance of $2,500 a month, of which 80 per cent is co-funded by the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan ad­mit­ted that be­ing a trainee while some of her peers have man­aged to se­cure full-time jobs upon grad­u­at­ing from univer­sity on time is “a bit dis­ap­point­ing”, but she is main­tain­ing a pos­i­tive at­ti­tude.</p>
    <p>“Life throws things at you and it isn’t fair, but we just have to learn how to deal with it and not let it beat you down,” she added.</p>
