    <p>With the im­pend­ing clo­sure of Robin­sons fresh on the minds of shop­pers, many have ques­tioned the fate of depart­ment stores here. What can one do to sur­vive the tough re­tail cli­mate?</p>
    <p>For some re­tail­ers, it means turn­ing their at­ten­tion to beauty. In the last few months, a few have forged ahead with am­bi­tious in­vest­ments to di­ver­sify and im­prove their beauty of­fer­ings.</p>
    <p>Su­per­siz­ing beauty of­fer­ings has its perks. The beauty mar­ket here is big, with Sin­ga­pore­ans spend­ing US$296 mil­lion (S$402 mil­lion) on beauty and fash­ion prod­ucts last year, ac­cord­ing to e-com­merce lo­gis­tics so­lu­tions provider Janio Asia.</p>
    <p>Re­search com­pany Euromon­i­tor es­ti­mated that the Sin­ga­pore beauty and per­sonal care mar­ket will be worth $1.85 bil­lion by next year.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to data com­pany Statista, the lo­cal cos­met­ics mar­ket is ex­pected to have a CAGR (com­pound an­nual growth rate) of 2.7 per cent from 2020 to 2025, although it is not clear if these fig­ures will be af­fected by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Depart­ment stores are not nec­es­sar­ily an out­dated con­cept when it comes to beauty ei­ther.</p>
    <p>A 2019 re­port on Gen Z spend­ing by Amer­i­can in­vest­ment bank Piper Jaf­fray Com­pa­nies found that 91 per cent of fe­male teens pre­ferred do­ing their beauty shop­ping in-store.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, beauty and per­sonal care made up 28.2 per cent of sales from depart­ment stores in 2019, Euromon­i­tor found.</p>
    <p>Tangs at Tang Plaza has been rolling out a year-long re­fresh of its Beauty Hall, in­tro­duc­ing new brands as well as re­vamp­ing tra­di­tional counter spa­ces into more dis­tinct “store-in-store” con­cepts.</p>
    <p>Last Mon­day, BHG Sin­ga­pore un­veiled an ex­ten­sive re­vamp of its Beauty Hall at Bugis Junc­tion.</p>
    <p>The depart­ment store dou­bled its num­ber of beauty brands, in­tro­duced five spa cab­ins, and added a mo­bile point-of-sale (POS) cashier sys­tem, al­low­ing cus­tomers to make cash­less pay­ments for pur­chases with­out queue­ing at a cen­tral cashier.</p>
    <p>Head of mer­chan­dis­ing Vivien</p>
    <p>Lim says the re­vamp had been planned since the mid­dle of last year and is part of the rein­ven­tion plan of BHG, which launched an e-com­merce store in June.</p>
    <p>“We want to lead in the trans­for­ma­tion of Sin­ga­pore’s depart­ment store scene by cre­at­ing a more im­mer­sive shop­ping ex­pe­ri­ence, where cus­tomers can be fully en­gaged with the dif­fer­ent brands on the floor,” she says.</p>
    <p>Given free rein to con­cep­tu­alise their coun­ters, brands like Gucci Beauty and Burberry Beauty now stand out with dis­tinct de­signs.</p>
    <p>Tech has been a big fac­tor in the re­vamp. The mo­bile point-of­sale sys­tem was quickly rolled out for this pan­demic, says Ms Lim, “as it in­tro­duces semi-con­tact­less touch points, mak­ing shop­ping a much safer ex­pe­ri­ence”.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Sk­inCeu­ti­cals, Yves Saint Lau­rent Beaute and Nars in­cor­po­rated AR (aug­mented re­al­ity) tech­nol­ogy at their coun­ters to let cus­tomers ex­pe­ri­ence prod­ucts with­out phys­i­cally testing them.</p>
    <p>Sk­inCeu­ti­cals in­vested heav­ily in tech for its counter at BHG Bugis – its sec­ond one in Sin­ga­pore and “largest Sk­inCeu­ti­cals depart­ment store counter in the world”.</p>
    <p>The med­i­cal aes­thet­ics skin­care brand un­der the L’Oreal Group de­buted in­no­va­tions such as an AI ro­bot that as­sists cus­tomers with prod­uct de­tails, prices and a mini store tour.</p>
    <p>Also new are a Lift and Learn Wall, where cus­tomers can in­ter­act with and learn more about the brand’s hero prod­ucts by lift­ing the prod­uct in their hand.</p>
    <p>L’Oreal Sin­ga­pore’s coun­try man­ager Iris Lam says BHG Bugis and Sk­inCeu­ti­cals were aligned in their vi­sion for dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and beauty tech.</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic has em­pha­sised how im­por­tant it is to in­no­vate our prod­ucts and ser­vices, to pro­vide con­sumers with re­tail-tain­ment, con­sul­ta­tion and per­son­alised rec­om­men­da­tions.”</p>
    <p>Be­fore launch­ing its first counter at Tang Plaza last year, Sk­inCeu­ti­cals was avail­able here only in aes­theti­cian clin­ics.</p>
    <p>Depart­ment stores have a “ded­i­cated data­base of con­sumers and mem­bers, and show­case nu­mer­ous brands un­der one roof”, says Ms Lam on the de­ci­sion to in­vest in a depart­ment store as op­posed to a stand­alone store.</p>
    <p>“This ap­peals to con­sumers who love the shop­ping and brows­ing ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>“Our Tangs store opened last year and quickly be­came the brand’s num­ber one out­let, re­cruit­ing mostly new-to-brand cus­tomers,” she adds.</p>
    <p>Dr Lynda Wee, ad­junct as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of mar­ket­ing at Nanyang Busi­ness School, ob­serves that it is an apt time to be fo­cus­ing on beauty.</p>
    <p>“De­mand for skin­care is high now – es­pe­cially for skin­care and cos­met­ics such as foun­da­tion and lip­stick that do not stain our masks.”</p>
    <p>She reck­ons this busi­ness strat­egy could be a call­back to the glory days of depart­ment stores. Be­fore beauty re­tail­ers like Sephora en­tered the scene in 2008, they were the go-to for con­sumers to pick up their favourite beauty brands.</p>
    <p>“The beauty depart­ment was one of the top draws, of­ten oc­cu­py­ing prime space – the ground floor,” says Dr Wee. But they “lost ground in terms of brand va­ri­ety and beauty shop­ping ex­pe­ri­ence” as com­pe­ti­tion grew.</p>
    <p>Cur­rent ef­forts to make over their beauty de­part­ments must also “ad­dress on­line com­pe­ti­tion” like in­flu­encer con­tent, she adds.</p>
    <p>“Beef­ing up beauty is in­suf­fi­cient. The depart­ment store con­cept must be reimag­ined to be value-based, where re­tail­ers un­der­stand who their core cus­tomers are and what val­ues they seek.”</p>
    <p>None­the­less, stores are on the right track in pri­ori­tis­ing prod­uct cu­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>“Stock­ing new-to-mar­ket brands, lo­cal or over­seas, brings fresh­ness. And ex­clu­siv­ity helps to dif­fer­en­ti­ate,” says Dr Wee.</p>
    <p>“The cos­met­ics cat­e­gory needs re­freshed prod­ucts or brands, as con­sumers keep seek­ing new and im­proved ways to look good.”</p>
    <p>Aside from the brand coun­ters, BHG cre­ated an all-new Beauty Library of 20 sus­tain­able “na­turein­spired” in­die beauty and well­ness la­bels – af­ter “ob­serv­ing an in­crease in de­mand for sus­tain­able, en­vi­ron­men­tally friendly and nat­u­ral prod­ucts in the lo­cal mar­ket, with more younger con­sumers join­ing this new mix”, says Ms Lim.</p>
    <p>Seventy per cent are ex­clu­sive to Beauty Library. The la­bels hail from Sweden to South Africa, and in­clude home-grown brands. BHG looks for­ward to adding more lo­cal brands, if suit­able, in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Smaller re­tail­ers have picked up on the trend too.</p>
    <p>Home-grown multi-la­bel fash­ion re­tailer SocietyA, known for show­cas­ing Asian de­sign­ers, de­buted a beauty line in May.</p>
    <p>SocietyA Beauty (so­ci­ety-a. com/beauty) builds on the store’s mis­sion to high­light Asian la­bels, cu­rat­ing in­de­pen­dent beauty brands from around Asia.</p>
    <p>Launch­ing a beauty di­vi­sion was a “nat­u­ral next step” for SocietyA, says gen­eral man­ager Lily Hamid. It was moved to an ear­lier date from Oc­to­ber, al­beit with phased re­leases, to help women prac­tise self-care dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>The line de­buted with lo­cal la­bels in­clud­ing Sigi Skin, Nodspark, and Oo La lab, pro­gres­sively adding ex­clu­sive brands such as Mel­low Nat­u­rals from Thai­land, CELLOOM from Korea, and Nita Cos­met­ics from Malaysia. It aims to have around 25 Asian beauty brands on the site by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>As most SocietyA cus­tomers en­joy both fash­ion and beauty prod­ucts, hav­ing the line of­fers “the ex­tra value of con­ve­nience to shop for all their favourite prod­ucts with us”, says Ms Hamid.</p>
    <p>“From a brand­ing per­spec­tive, adding beauty to our belt can help strengthen our po­si­tion­ing as the go-to plat­form for all-things Asian.</p>
    <p>“From a sales per­spec­tive, we are look­ing at in­creased rev­enue with the in­tro­duc­tion of a new prod­uct cat­e­gory.”</p>
    <p>At the re­quest of shop­pers, a pop-up Beauty Bar was set up at SocietyA’s store in Takashimay­a that ended yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ms Hamid adds: “SocietyA Beauty has been ex­tremely well re­ceived by both long-time sup­port­ers and new friends of SocietyA. Many shared that they are glad to have dis­cov­ered prod­ucts that are suit­able for our Asian skin types and cli­mate.”</p>
