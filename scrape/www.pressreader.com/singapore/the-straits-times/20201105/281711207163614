    <p>There were seven new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,036.</p>
    <p>These in­cluded five im­ported cases who had been placed on stay-home no­tices on ar­rival here, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH). There were no new cases in the com­mu­nity. Two were from work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>MOH said that among the five im­ported pa­tients, one is a de­pen­dant’s pass holder. The 33-year-old Indian na­tional, a woman, ar­rived from the United Arab Emi­rates.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing four im­ported cases are cur­rently em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore. One is a 24-year-old male Swiss work pass holder who ar­rived from Switzer­land. The other three are work per­mit hold­ers. Two women – a 27-year-old and a 32-year-old – are Myan­mar na­tion­als who ar­rived from Myan­mar. The third is a 33-yearold fe­male In­done­sian who ar­rived from In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>All five im­ported pa­tients tested pos­i­tive on Tues­day and did not show symp­toms.</p>
    <p>Of the two cases liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries, both were de­tected through sur­veil­lance test­ing, said MOH.</p>
    <p>It added that the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with one such case in the past week, who is cur­rently un­linked.</p>
    <p>With one pa­tient dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,923 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 44 pa­tients re­mained in hos­pi­tal yes­ter­day. None is in in­ten­sive care. Another 26 were re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
