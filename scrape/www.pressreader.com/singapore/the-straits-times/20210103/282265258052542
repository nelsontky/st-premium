    <p>Over the past few years, Sin­ga­porean hip-hop artist Alyph had stepped back from the spot­light, fo­cus­ing in­stead on mak­ing hits for re­gional acts.</p>
    <p>The 31-year-old for­mer mem­ber of pop­u­lar rap duo Sleeq, who used to go by the moniker Alif, is now set to make a come­back as a solo artist this year.</p>
    <p>Signed to the South-east Asian wing of iconic Amer­i­can hip-hop record la­bel Def Jam, he will release an EP in Fe­bru­ary, III/III, with three songs that will fea­ture a new, more R&B-ori­ented sound. He will also release another EP later in the year.</p>
    <p>The al­bum will be a sig­nif­i­cant release for one of the home-grown hip-hop scene’s most pop­u­lar per­son­al­i­ties – his In­sta­gram ac­count has more than 183,000 fol­low­ers and the songs he has worked on have clocked 218 mil­lion views col­lec­tively on YouTube.</p>
    <p>The fo­cus now is to pro­duce songs for him­self, he tells The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>“I’m pick­ing up from the last time I paid 100 per cent at­ten­tion to my­self and my mu­sic,” says the hip-hop artist, whose real name is Muham­mad Alif Ab­dul­lah.</p>
    <p>He came into promi­nence in 2005 when he formed pop/hiphop duo Sleeq with his cousin, Syarif.</p>
    <p>Their bilin­gual songs, sung in English and Malay, be­came pop­u­lar in Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>They scored hits such as Un­tuk Dia (For Him/Her), a 2012 song fea­tur­ing Malaysian singer Na­jwa Latif that has more than 29 mil­lion views on YouTube.</p>
    <p>In 2015, Sleeq split up. Alyph and Syarif went on to fo­cus on their solo ca­reers.</p>
    <p>Yet the songs they col­lab­o­rated on still re­main pop­u­lar. In 2019, Alyph picked up the Top Lo­cal Malay Pop Song prize at the Com­posers and Au­thors So­ci­ety of Sin­ga­pore (Com­pass) awards for writ­ing Tepi Sikit (Move Aside) in 2014. The Sleeq song earned the ac­co­lade by col­lect­ing the most roy­al­ties among Malay pop songs that year.</p>
    <p>As a song­writer and pro­ducer, Alyph went on to score more pop­u­lar tunes for Malaysian artists.</p>
    <p>One of his most prom­i­nent tunes was Malaysian hip-hop group KClique’s Mimpi (Dream), a song he pro­duced and co-wrote.</p>
    <p>With more than 47 mil­lion views on YouTube, it pro­pelled K-Clique to be­come the se­cond-most­played lo­cal act among Malaysian lis­ten­ers on stream­ing gi­ant Spo­tify last year, be­hind pop queen Siti Nurhal­iza.</p>
    <p>He also worked on hits for other Malaysian acts such as singer Kaka Azraff and rap­per Joe Fl­iz­zow.</p>
    <p>Last year, Alyph turned his fo­cus to fel­low Sin­ga­pore­ans and re­leased a song, Amaz­ing, with fel­low rap­per Yung Raja and elec­tronic mu­sic pro­ducer Tri­fect.</p>
    <p>As a pre­cur­sor to his up­com­ing EP, he also re­leased a solo sin­gle, Adakah Kau Men­den­gar (Are You Lis­ten­ing?), last month.</p>
    <p>On the trio of tunes he is look­ing for­ward to de­but­ing this year, he says: “These three songs be­long to­gether, son­i­cally and con­cep­tu­ally. I l ove trilo­gies, so they rep­re­sent a be­gin­ning, mid­dle and the end.”</p>
    <p>I’m pick­ing up from the last time I paid 100 per cent at­ten­tion to my­self and my mu­sic.</p>
