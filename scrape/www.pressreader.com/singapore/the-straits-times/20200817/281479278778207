    <p>Stu­dent Sophia Wong un­der­went re­con­struc­tion surgery at Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal (KTPH) in Jan­uary for a knee lig­a­ment tear and had to go for phys­io­ther­apy after the op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Her weekly ses­sions at the hos­pi­tal were moved on­line dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker be­gin­ning April 7 due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. She met the phys­io­ther­a­pist on video-con­fer­enc­ing plat­form Zoom, fort­nightly at first, and ev­ery three to four weeks now.</p>
    <p>The 17-year-old said the on­line ses­sions have en­cour­aged her to mon­i­tor her progress and bring up con­cerns with the phys­io­ther­a­pist.</p>
    <p>“Oc­ca­sion­ally, when I’m un­sure if I’m do­ing the ex­er­cises cor­rectly, I’ll ask the phys­io­ther­a­pist. With guided ad­vice, my con­cerns are eas­ily re­solved,” she said.</p>
    <p>Hos­pi­tals have in­creased tel­ere­ha­bil­i­ta­tion ser­vices due to cur­rent safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>This al­lows ther­a­pists to mon­i­tor the pa­tients’ progress vir­tu­ally, and also pro­vides re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion ser­vices such as phys­io­ther­apy, speech ther­apy and oc­cu­pa­tional ther­apy through on­line plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Mr Jonathan Loh, a se­nior phys­io­ther­a­pist at KTPH Re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion Ser­vices, said its tele-con­sul­ta­tion ser­vice is usu­ally of­fered to pa­tients with stable med­i­cal con­di­tions where ex­er­cise ther­apy is the main form of treat­ment and also to those who are on track with re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients who re­ceive re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion vir­tu­ally only need a mo­bile de­vice with In­ter­net ac­cess.</p>
    <p>They are en­cour­aged to use tablets or lap­tops as the larger screen gives a bet­ter view of ex­er­cises demon­strated by ther­a­pists. They are also ad­vised on the equip­ment to use, usu­ally house­hold items or weights.</p>
    <p>The ses­sions can be done with pa­tients on their own or with a fam­ily mem­ber or care­giver by their side.</p>
    <p>Mr Loh said ther­a­pists at KTPH have been hold­ing a com­bi­na­tion of phys­i­cal ses­sions and tele-con­sul­ta­tions since the cir­cuit breaker was lifted in June.</p>
    <p>“New cases are seen face-to-face to al­low the re­hab team to do a com­pre­hen­sive ini­tial as­sess­ment and for­mu­late a man­age­ment plan. Pa­tients are of­fered tele-con­sul­ta­tions for sub­se­quent ses­sions if their con­di­tions are deemed stable and suitable,” he said.</p>
    <p>Yishun Health, which com­prises KTPH and Yishun Com­mu­nity Hos­pi­tal, has held about 220 tele-con­sul­ta­tions in phys­io­ther­apy, oc­cu­pa­tional ther­apy and speech ther­apy since May.</p>
    <p>Alexan­dra Hos­pi­tal’s Re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion Ser­vices’ tele-re­hab cases have in­creased from four in April to an av­er­age of 20 new cases monthly. The ser­vices cover phys­io­ther­apy, oc­cu­pa­tional ther­apy, speech ther­apy and po­di­a­try re­views.</p>
    <p>Ms Beryl Wong, prin­ci­pal phys­io­ther­a­pist at Alexan­dra Hos­pi­tal, said that apart from pa­tients sav­ing time and the trans­port cost of trav­el­ling to the hos­pi­tal, tele-re­hab is ben­e­fi­cial as they do ther­apy in the com­fort of their home and do not risk con­tract­ing Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Ms Pha Hui Jun, 31, a se­nior ex­ec­u­tive in a ter­tiary in­sti­tu­tion, has been un­der­go­ing phys­io­ther­apy at the hos­pi­tal since last year. She had her first tele-re­hab ses­sion this month, and her ther­apy com­prises neck and shoul­der ex­er­cises to treat re­cur­ring mi­graines.</p>
    <p>She said she showed the ther­a­pist via Zoom the area where she does her work­outs at home.</p>
    <p>The ther­a­pist no­ticed the back sup­port of her chair, which she uses for over eight hours when work­ing at home, was too low.</p>
    <p>Ms Pha said: “She ad­vised me to use a pil­low for bet­ter sup­port. If not for the video con­sul­ta­tion, I wouldn’t have thought of show­ing her my chair.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, there are down­sides that come with tele-re­hab.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong said: “Phys­io­ther­a­pists can­not cor­rect a pa­tient’s pos­ture in per­son and there is a lack of faceto-face in­ter­ac­tion. Be­cause of this, pa­tients may mis­in­ter­pret the ad­vice given and may not be able to repli­cate or per­form the ex­er­cises ac­cu­rately without the ther­a­pist’s phys­i­cal as­sis­tance.”</p>
    <p>With tele-re­hab, phys­io­ther­a­pists are also un­able to test a pa­tient’s mus­cle strength us­ing re­sis­tance tests, said Mr Loh. To get around this, a pa­tient’s strength is tested through re­peated sit-to-stand tasks.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients are asked to help phys­io­ther­a­pists take mea­sure­ments, for ex­am­ple, girth mea­sure­ments of thigh mus­cles, us­ing a tape mea­sure.</p>
    <p>Speech ther­a­pist Chris­tine Chua from Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal (TTSH) said there are lim­i­ta­tions on ac­tiv­i­ties that re­quire speech ther­a­pists to pro­vide tac­tile cues or use spe­cialised equip­ment that pa­tients do not own.</p>
    <p>Speech ther­a­pists con­duct­ing tele-re­hab have to ob­serve pa­tients closely for the slight­est signs of dif­fi­culty when as­sess­ing their abil­ity to swal­low when eat­ing or drink­ing.</p>
    <p>“In this case, cor­rob­o­rated in­for­ma­tion pro­vided by pa­tients and their care­givers is im­por­tant,” said Ms Chua.</p>
    <p>About 15 to 20 per cent of out­pa­tient speech ther­apy ses­sions at TTSH are cur­rently con­ducted via tele-re­hab.</p>
    <p>Pro­gram­mer Peter Lee finds on­line speech ther­apy ses­sions a “com­fort­able” ex­pe­ri­ence. The 60-yearold, whose speech is im­paired due to Parkin­son’s dis­ease, had his first tele-re­hab ses­sion in March.</p>
    <p>He said: “Do­ing voice con­trol prac­tice at home elim­i­nates the worry of go­ing to the hos­pi­tal and the fear of con­tract­ing Covid-19. And my wife doesn’t need to de­plete her an­nual leave to take me there. It’s con­ve­nient.”</p>
    <p>Ther­a­pists at Changi Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal’s (CGH) Re­ha­bil­i­ta­tive Ser­vices have held an av­er­age of 120 tele-re­hab ses­sions monthly since June. Se­nior phys­io­ther­a­pist Wong Shi Hui said one of the chal­lenges for pa­tients is not hav­ing ad­e­quate space for ther­apy ses­sions and hav­ing to po­si­tion them­selves at a dis­tance away from the cam­era so they can be seen fully.</p>
    <p>How­ever, re­tiree Chong Mah Lay, 75, who has had four tele-re­hab ses­sions in phys­io­ther­apy with CGH, said she found it very con­ve­nient.</p>
    <p>“My chil­dren taught me how to use Zoom and I have not had any chal­lenges as the phys­io­ther­a­pist’s in­struc­tions and demon­stra­tions are very clear,” said Madam Chong.</p>
    <p>Dr Effie Chew, who heads Re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion Medicine at Alexan­dra Hos­pi­tal, said: “Covid-19 has ac­cel­er­ated the adop­tion of tele-re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion. While Covid-19 is dev­as­tat­ing in its im­pact and ef­fect in so many ar­eas of health­care de­liv­ery, it also presents op­por­tu­ni­ties for us to re­think and re­set a new nor­mal.”</p>
