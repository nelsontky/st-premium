    <p>Lo­cal in­vestors trod care­fully af­ter of­fi­cial fig­ures out­lin­ing Sin­ga­pore’s worst quar­terly eco­nomic per­for­mance landed with an almighty thud yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The dire num­bers – growth fell 13.2 per cent be­tween April and June – sent the Straits Times In­dex (STI) down 1.36 points, or 0.05 per cent, to end at 2,544.15, with prospects of more bad news ahead.</p>
    <p>Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try fore­cast­ers have tight­ened their pro­jec­tions for the coun­try af­ter the grim gross do­mes­tic prod­uct num­ber. They are now braced for a con­trac­tion of be­tween 5 per cent and 7 per cent for the full year, com­pared with the 4 per cent to 7 per cent es­ti­mate made ear­lier.</p>
    <p>HSBC econ­o­mist Yun Liu noted that ac­tiv­ity in the three months to June 30 fell at a “record pace”, with weak­ness in all sec­tors, re­flect­ing the sig­nif­i­cant im­pact of the twom­onth cir­cuit breaker mea­sures.</p>
    <p>But Ms Yun be­lieves the worst is over. “While Sin­ga­pore has been hard hit, we think the econ­omy has likely hit the trough and will grad­u­ally bot­tom out in (the third quar­ter).”</p>
    <p>Kep­pel Corp lost 11.11 per cent to close at $4.80 amid a sell-off af­ter Te­masek an­nounced that it was pulling the plug on its $4.1 bil­lion par­tial of­fer be­cause the firm’s $697.6 mil­lion net loss for its sec­ond fi­nan­cial quar­ter breached a key con­di­tion for the deal.</p>
    <p>Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries dived 2.63 per cent to $1.85, de­spite share­hold­ers vot­ing over­whelm­ingly in favour of the pro­posed $2.1 bil­lion re­cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of Sem­b­corp Marine as well as a de­merger from each other that will re­sult i n Te­masek hav­ing a di­rect stake in the marine arm.</p>
    <p>Both coun­ters ex­pe­ri­enced volatile price swings in the sec­ond half of the trad­ing ses­sion amid mixed sen­ti­ments from in­vestors.</p>
    <p>Ven­ture Cor­po­ra­tion was the top gainer for the day, up 6.16 per cent to $20. It has raised its in­terim div­i­dend to 25 cents a share from 20 cents, de­spite a 28.2 per cent fall in first-half net profit.</p>
    <p>OCBC Re­search an­a­lysts have lifted net profit fore­casts for the firm by 2.5 per cent for the 2020 fi­nan­cial year and 8.6 per cent for next year, say­ing the sec­ond quar­ter was a “turn­ing point” for the group.</p>
    <p>Avi­a­tion and avi­a­tion ser­vices-re­lated stocks gained: Sin­ga­pore Air­lines rose 3.15 per cent, while Sats gained 1.85 per cent. Banks, too, were among the gain­ers: DBS Bank rose 1.21 per cent to $20.85, OCBC Bank inched up 0.46 per cent to $8.76 and United Over­seas Bank climbed 0.36 per cent to $19.65. Re­gional mar­kets were mixed.</p>
    <p>The KLSE slipped 0.44 per cent and the Shanghai Com­pos­ite fell 1.15 per cent. Mean­while, the Hang Seng Com­pos­ite In­dex rose 1.25 per cent and the Nikkei added 1.88 per cent.</p>
