    <p>Ac­tress Linda Chung is in Hong Kong film­ing tele­vi­sion serial Chil­dren’s Hospi­tal, which also stars Ken­neth Ma, Kevin Cheng and Him Law.</p>
    <p>But the show could very well be her last.</p>
    <p>In an interview with the me­dia af­ter film­ing the mu­sic video for the show’s theme song, the 36-year-old ac­tress said she has been in Hong Kong for three months and misses her hus­band and chil­dren, who are back in Canada.</p>
    <p>Chung, known for act­ing in Foren­sic He­roes (2006), Heart Of Greed (2007) and A Jour­ney Called Life (2008), is mar­ried to chi­ro­prac­tor Jeremy Le­ung. The cou­ple have two chil­dren – Kelly, four, and Jared, two.</p>
    <p>She said she orig­i­nally planned to ar­range for them to visit Hong Kong in Au­gust, but this was aborted due to the ris­ing number of Covid-19 cases in Hong Kong and Van­cou­ver, Canada.</p>
    <p>“We are com­mu­ni­cat­ing via video ev­ery night,” she said. “My son is still young and does not mind greet­ing me via cam­era. My daugh­ter is closer to me and tells me fre­quently: ‘Miss you, come home now.’”</p>
    <p>Chung ad­mit­ted she felt lonely in Hong Kong and would con­tinue to mon­i­tor the sit­u­a­tion closely.</p>
    <p>She said she might stay in Hong Kong longer if her hus­band and chil­dren could join her if the sit­u­a­tion im­proved. Oth­er­wise, she will re­turn to Canada once film­ing ends.</p>
    <p>“I am count­ing down the days as I still have 36 days of film­ing,” she said.</p>
    <p>She said she ap­pre­ci­ated her hus­band tak­ing care of the chil­dren while she was away but added she did not want to be away from her fam­ily for so long in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“This may be my last drama, I re­ally don’t know. I may film the next one in 10 years’ time,” she said. “I have to con­sider my role as a mother when I take on the next job.”</p>
    <p>She is now treat­ing the show as her last and try­ing to do her best. “I do not want to dis­ap­point my fam­ily as they have been sup­port­ive of my work,” she said.</p>
