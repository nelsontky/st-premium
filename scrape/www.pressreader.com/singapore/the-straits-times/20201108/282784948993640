    <p>LON­DON Ar­se­nal must aim to score up to 100 goals a sea­son to com­ple­ment their solid de­fen­sive record if they are to com­pete with the Pre­mier League elite, man­ager Mikel Arteta said on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The ninth-placed Gun­ners have con­ceded the least goals (seven) in the league this sea­son, but they have scored j ust nine times in seven games – sec­ond-low­est among the top 10 teams in the com­pe­ti­tion after Wolver­hamp­ton Wan­der­ers.</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard, how­ever, said the team proved their at­tack­ing po­ten­tial when they thrashed Nor­we­gian side Molde 4-1 in the Europa</p>
    <p>League on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“To get that bal­ance right is not easy,” Arteta told a news con­fer­ence ahead of to­day’s home game against As­ton Villa, who are level on 12 points with Ar­se­nal but have played one game less.</p>
    <p>“It is some­thing that we have been work­ing on in the last two weeks.</p>
    <p>“You could see last night that we were much more flu­ent in at­tack. We scored the goals and we had more op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>“To be a top team, you have to score 90-100 goals (a sea­son) if you want to be com­pet­ing with the top guns.</p>
    <p>“It is a chal­lenge for us and an area we have to im­prove and get bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>Arteta also said he ex­pects Villa to be ea­ger for a win at the Emi­rates Sta­dium, after suc­ces­sive de­feats by Leeds United and Southamp­ton, and that Ar­se­nal will be wary of the threat pos­sessed by their in-form cap­tain Jack Gre­al­ish.</p>
    <p>“He (Gre­al­ish) is a player who can make a dif­fer­ence at any mo­ment in the game,” the 38-year-old man­ager said.</p>
    <p>“He has this per­son­al­ity against any op­po­nent, at any ground, to take the ball in any area of the pitch and he can make the dif­fer­ence, so we have to look after him.”</p>
    <p>Villa have had more points now – 12 in six games – than they did after 12 matches last sea­son and man­ager Dean Smith be­lieves his team are in a good place de­spite the last two losses.</p>
    <p>He said: “We still feel that we’ve had a good start (even if) the last two re­sults have been dis­ap­point­ing. The play­ers are still con­fi­dent, that’s for sure, they want to put it right.”</p>
