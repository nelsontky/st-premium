    <p>LON­DON • Sean Con­nery, the Scot­tish-born ac­tor who was the first to ut­ter the fa­mous movie line, “the name’s Bond, James Bond”, has died. He was 90.</p>
    <p>His death was con­firmed by his fam­ily, the BBC re­ported yes­ter­day. Con­nery, who had been un­well, died overnight in his sleep while in the Ba­hamas.</p>
    <p>Though he made more than 60 films, win­ning an Os­car for his sup­port­ing role as an in­cor­rupt­ible law­man on the trail of Al Capone in The Un­touch­ables (1987), Con­nery was most closely af­fil­i­ated with the debonair fic­tional Bri­tish spy he por­trayed seven times.</p>
    <p>He i ntro­duced Bond and his trade­mark greet­ing i n Dr No (1962), which turned Con­nery into an in­ter­na­tional star. He would go on to play the wo­man­is­ing, mar­tini-quaffing spy, cre­ated by Ian Flem­ing, in From Rus­sia With Love (1963), Goldfin­ger (1964), Thun­der­ball (1965), You Only Live Twice (1967) and Di­a­monds Are For­ever (1971). In 1983, Con­nery starred in one more Bond movie, Never Say Never Again.</p>
    <p>“Con­nery was al­ways my favourite Bond and I’d be ly­ing if I said I didn’t feel the pres­sure to mea­sure up to him,” Pierce Bros­nan said in an in­ter­view with Cine­fan­tas­tique magazine in 1995, the year he took over the Bond role.</p>
    <p>Bros­nan, Ge­orge Lazenby, Roger Moore, Ti­mothy Dal­ton and Daniel Craig all played Bond, none cap­tur­ing the same fol­low­ing as Con­nery. He was voted the best Bond ac­tor, with 56 per cent of the votes, in a 2012 poll by NPR news or­gan­i­sa­tion. Craig came in sec­ond, with 28 per cent.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple magazine named Con­nery its sex­i­est man alive for 1989. In 1997, it hailed him for re­main­ing “a man’s man of ac­tion who still leaves women as shaken as any of Bond’s mar­ti­nis”.</p>
    <p>For­mer Bloomberg News critic Peter Rainer in 2006 called Con­nery “the rare ex­am­ple of a per­former who be­came a ver­sa­tile ac­tor af­ter be­ing iden­ti­fied with a fa­mous role”.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to Con­nery’s Os­car­win­ning per­for­mance, Mr Rainer cited his roles as a sadis­tic Lon­don po­lice de­tec­tive in Sid­ney Lumet’s The Of­fence, a Bri­tish sol­dier in The Man Who Would Be King and a dash­ing thief in Michael Crich­ton’s The Great Train Rob­bery, all re­leased in the 1970s.</p>
    <p>He played the es­tranged fa­ther of Har­ri­son Ford’s swash­buck­ling ar­chae­ol­o­gist in In­di­ana Jones And The Last Cru­sade (1989), the muti­nous com­mand­ing of­fi­cer of a Soviet submarine in The Hunt For Red Oc­to­ber (1990), King Arthur in First Knight (1995) and a reclu­sive writer who men­tors a tal­ented black teenager in Find­ing For­rester (2000). His last role in a film was The League Of Ex­tra­or­di­nary Gen­tle­men (2003).</p>
    <p>Thomas Sean Con­nery was born on Aug 25, 1930, in the work­ing­class dis­trict of Foun­tain­bridge in Ed­in­burgh. The el­der of two boys, he first slept in a drawer in a tra­di­tional Scot­tish apart­ment called a ten­e­ment. His home was de­mol­ished decades ago, though there is a plaque with his name on it at a new hous­ing de­vel­op­ment there.</p>
    <p>Con­nery left school at 14 and worked a range of jobs in­clud­ing brick­layer, life­guard and cof­fin pol­isher. At 16, he joined the Royal Navy be­fore a stom­ach ul­cer prompted his re­turn to civil­ian life in Ed­in­burgh. At 19, he posed as a model at the Ed­in­burgh Art School. Body­build­ing and a shot at the Mr Uni­verse ti­tle – he came in third – led to a ca­reer in act­ing.</p>
    <p>Con­nery spent much of the 1950s mod­el­ling, play­ing bit theatri­cal parts and mak­ing the odd cho­rus ap­pear­ance. Then in 1958, he won his first sig­nif­i­cant film role, play­ing op­po­site Lana Turner in An­other Time, An­other Place as a war cor­re­spon­dent who falls in love with an Amer­i­can jour­nal­ist.</p>
    <p>He stuck with act­ing un­til he won the role that made him a house­hold name.</p>
    <p>Flem­ing, as au­thor of the Bond nov­els, re­served the right to ap­prove the ac­tor who would play the char­ac­ter on film and he wanted that to be Cary Grant, ac­cord­ing to a 1989 Los An­ge­les Times ar­ti­cle. The team mak­ing the Bond films, led by pro­ducer Al­bert Broc­coli, could not af­ford such a big star.</p>
    <p>Broc­coli was in­trigued by Con­nery’s per­for­mance in the Walt Dis­ney Pro­duc­tions film Darby O’Gill And The Lit­tle Peo­ple (1959). Af­ter Broc­coli’s wife, Dana, told him that Con­nery “has sex ap­peal”, he in­sisted on cast­ing him as Bond.</p>
    <p>Con­nery’s role as Jim Mal­one, a Chicago cop who helps track down mob­ster Al Capone in The Un­touch­ables, also won him a Golden Globe Award.</p>
    <p>In 2000, Con­nery was knighted af­ter a de­lay that he at­trib­uted to his ar­dent sup­port of Scot­tish in­de­pen­dence from the UK. One of two tat­toos he got af­ter join­ing the Navy said “Scot­land For­ever”.</p>
    <p>Con­nery, how­ever, was re­luc­tant to delve deeper into pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>“I’m too naive to be a politi­cian,” he said. “Politi­cians don’t have enough dream in them. I ac­tu­ally be­lieve that things can be done.”</p>
    <p>Con­nery mar­ried French-born artist Miche­line Ro­que­brune in 1975. With his first wife, Diane Ci­lento, he had a son, Ja­son Con­nery.</p>
    <p>AC­TION MAN</p>
    <p>Politi­cians don’t have enough dream in them. I ac­tu­ally be­lieve that things can be done.</p>
    <p>SEAN CON­NERY, who was an ar­dent sup­porter of Scot­tish in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>PRES­SURE OF MEA­SUR­ING UP</p>
    <p>Con­nery was al­ways my favourite Bond, and I’d be ly­ing if I said I didn’t feel the pres­sure to mea­sure up to him.</p>
