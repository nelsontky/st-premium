    <p>BEIJING • The for­mer chair­man of one of China’s largest state-con­trolled as­set man­age­ment firms has been sen­tenced to death for so­lic­it­ing US$260 mil­lion (S$342.8 mil­lion) in bribes, cor­rup­tion and bigamy.</p>
    <p>Lai Xiaomin, a for­mer Com­mu­nist Party mem­ber, gave a de­tailed con­fes­sion on state broad­caster CCTV in Jan­uary last year, with footage of a Beijing apart­ment re­port­edly be­long­ing to Lai re­plete with safes and cab­i­nets stuffed with stacks of cash.</p>
    <p>Lai had abused his po­si­tion in at­tempt­ing to ob­tain the vast sum, the court in Tian­jin said yes­ter­day, de­scrib­ing the bribes as “ex­tremely large” and call­ing the cir­cum­stances “par­tic­u­larly se­ri­ous”.</p>
    <p>He had shown “ex­treme ma­li­cious i ntent”, the court rul­ing added.</p>
    <p>Lai, for­mer chair­man of the Hong Kong-listed China Huarong As­set Man­age­ment, was also found guilty of bigamy af­ter liv­ing “as man and wife for long pe­ri­ods” out­side of his mar­riage and fa­ther­ing il­le­git­i­mate chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Lai, whose in­ves­ti­ga­tion started in April 2018, also em­bez­zled over 25 mil­lion yuan (S$5.1 mil­lion) in pub­lic funds be­tween 2009 and 2018.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing his tele­vised con­fes­sion, Lai told CCTV he “did not spend a sin­gle penny, and just kept it there... I did not dare to spend it”.</p>
    <p>CCTV also showed lux­ury cars and gold bars that it re­ported Lai had ac­cepted as bribes.</p>
    <p>CCTV of­ten broad­casts in­ter­views with sus­pects ad­mit­ting to crimes, even be­fore they have ap­peared in court – a prac­tice that has long been con­demned by lawyers and rights or­gan­i­sa­tions as forc­ing con­fes­sions un­der duress.</p>
