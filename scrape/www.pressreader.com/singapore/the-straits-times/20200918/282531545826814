    <p>Choose your favourite cut of chicken to go with curry noo­dles at Sheng Kee Curry Chicken Noo­dle at Berseh Food Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>With his brush cut hair­style, stall owner and head cook Teo Yee Sim, 48, looks slightly in­tim­i­dat­ing when stir­ring his vat of sim­mer­ing hot curry, but he is pretty cour­te­ous and ami­able.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers get a choice of three types of noo­dles: Laksa noo­dles, yel­low noo­dles and bee­hoon.</p>
    <p>Prices start at $4.</p>
    <p>Splurge a lit­tle and go for the $5 ver­sion, so that you can get a whole drum­stick or whole wing with your noo­dle of choice.</p>
    <p>Mr Teo’s con­trol of cook­ing time for the chicken, noo­dles and even the tau pok is pre­cise. The noo­dles are blanched in boil­ing wa­ter be­fore they are placed to­gether with the cut chicken and fur­ther blanched three times in the hot curry.</p>
    <p>His per­sonal favourite is a com­bi­na­tion of yel­low noo­dles and bee­hoon. These are sep­a­rately blanched so that the yel­low noo­dles are not over­cooked. This is the level of at­ten­tion to de­tail given by Mr Teo, who used to work as a restau­rant head chef.</p>
    <p>The curry gravy it­self is aro­matic with spices and flavour­ful be­cause of the sweet chicken stock. One se­cret is the use of Thai chilli oil in the curry gravy. The chicken meat is firm and juicy, the noo­dles bouncy.</p>
    <p>But the piece de re­sis­tance is Mr Teo’s house­made sam­bal chilli paste which he takes pride in pre­par­ing from scratch – all 55kg of it, ev­ery three weeks. It is packed with top-qual­ity dried prawns which cost $32 a kilo.</p>
    <p>WHERE: Berseh Food Cen­tre, 02-45, 166 Jalan Be­sar MRT: Far­rer Park OPEN: 6am to 3.30pm Mon­days to Fri­days; 6am to 2.30pm Satur­days and Sun­days. Closed on the third Mon­day of ev­ery month</p>
