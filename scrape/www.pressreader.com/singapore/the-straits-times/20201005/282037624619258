    <p>A New Zealand court has dis­missed a jailed Sin­ga­porean drug traf­ficker’s ap­pli­ca­tion to have a per­sonal lap­top in his cell and al­lowed au­dio-vis­ual con­nec­tions to Sin­ga­pore and the Philip­pines as well as in­ter­na­tional phone calls at mod­est charges.</p>
    <p>Justice Mathew Downs, in up­dated de­ci­sion grounds pub­lished last month, de­scribed the pris­oner, Thomas Cheng, as “po­lite, smart and highly in­tel­li­gent”.</p>
    <p>The case arose af­ter Cheng filed 22 claims for ju­di­cial re­view against New Zealand’s De­part­ment of Correction­s and sought in­terim re­lief for ad­di­tional items pend­ing a full hear­ing.</p>
    <p>“Cheng has ad­e­quate fa­cil­i­ties to pre­pare his cases, at least for now. He has been placed in a large cell to house his many boxes of le­gal doc­u­ments. He can use the com­puter in that cell to print doc­u­ments, which are then brought to him. He has printed many. One evening, he printed 4,000,” said the judge.</p>
    <p>The pris­oner claimed the com­puter in the cell was “in­ad­e­quate for the lit­i­ga­tion”.</p>
    <p>He said the com­puter did not recog­nise Word doc­u­ments (it uses open-source soft­ware) and did not have a Web browser, but the judge, in re­fus­ing his ap­pli­ca­tion, noted that his case was not one in which he was rep­re­sent­ing him­self. He has a de­fence lawyer.</p>
    <p>“Cheng’s re­lated claims for ju­di­cial re­view do not ap­pear strong. Lap­tops are no longer ‘au­tho­rised elec­tri­cal items’. So, Cheng does not have a right to a lap­top in his cell,” said the judge.</p>
    <p>Al­though Cheng “is a long way from home”, he is not pre­vented from ex­er­cis­ing con­tact with those abroad as he has a tele­phone in his cell.</p>
    <p>“He may use this when he likes, in­clud­ing to call fam­ily overseas, pro­vided he pays. (De­part­ment of) Correction­s has not been deaf to Cheng’s re­quests for au­dio-vis­ual links. Un­like Correction­s – I am poorly placed to as­sess se­cu­rity con­cerns in re­la­tion to Cheng that may af­fect what is sought. Cheng is not merely a sen­tenced pris­oner; he also faces crim­i­nal charges con­cern­ing al­leged of­fend­ing within prison, of­fend­ing said to have been fa­cil­i­tated by tech­nol­ogy,” said the judge.</p>
    <p>In 2018, Cheng, who was then 34, was convicted and sen­tenced to 10 years and nine months in jail for im­port­ing and sup­ply­ing metham­phetamine.</p>
    <p>But, in May last year, he faced 26 new crim­i­nal charges al­leg­ing that he dealt in drugs, com­mit­ted ag­gra­vated rob­bery and par­tic­i­pated in an or­gan­ised crim­i­nal en­ter­prise.</p>
    <p>The al­leged of­fend­ing oc­curred be­tween March 1, 2018 and May 9 last year while Cheng was still in prison, noted the judge.</p>
    <p>“In­terim re­lief is not nec­es­sary to pre­serve Cheng’s po­si­tion; mer­its do not ap­pear strong; and rel­e­vant se­cu­rity con­cerns lie more in the Ex­ec­u­tive’s prov­ince,” said Justice Downs.</p>
    <p>An­other New Zealand court, in July this year, ex­tended a re­strain­ing or­der un­til the end of this month on 15 named prop­er­ties in the coun­try and bank ac­counts that were linked to Cheng and two oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The New Zealand Po­lice Com­mis­sioner sought the freeze or­der as in­ves­ti­ga­tions con­tin­ued as a re­sult of Cheng’s drug of­fend­ing and monies linked to sus­pected tax eva­sion and money laun­der­ing.</p>
    <p>“The Com­mis­sioner reached the view that Mr Thomas Cheng as well as his father, Mr Wil­liam Cheng, and his father’s part­ner, Ms Nyioh Chew Hong (the for­mer be­ing the first in­ter­ested party and the lat­ter be­ing the sec­ond in­ter­ested party), had ben­e­fited from tax eva­sion and money laun­der­ing. Fur­ther re­strain­ing or­ders were ob­tained as a con­se­quence,” noted the court then.</p>
