    <p>MANILA Philip­pine box­ing icon Manny Pac­quiao wants to fight Ir­ish mixed mar­tial arts star Conor McGre­gor in the ring next year, an aide said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“For the sake of all the Filipino Covid-19 vic­tims, Se­na­tor Manny Pac­quiao will be fight­ing UFC su­per­star Conor McGre­gor next year,” Pac­quiao’s spe­cial as­sis­tant Jayke Jo­son said, adding ne­go­ti­a­tions are on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>The fight could be staged in the Mid­dle East af­ter the coro­n­avirus pan­demic abates, the aide said, adding Pac­quiao would donate a por­tion of his prize earn­ings to Philip­pine Covid-19 vic­tims.</p>
    <p>His pro­moter Sean Gib­bons ear­lier told AFP in Los An­ge­les that the eight-divi­sion world cham­pion was mulling a pos­si­ble come­back fight with McGre­gor, though the two camps were a “long way” from agree­ment. On Friday, McGre­gor, cur­rently re­tired, said on Twit­ter he was “box­ing Manny Pac­quiao next in the Mid­dle East”.</p>
    <p>“It will be a true honour to have faced two of the great­est box­ers of the mod­ern era,” added the 32-year-old, who faced wel­ter­weight king Floyd May­weather in a money-spin­ning 2017 fight.</p>
    <p>Pac­quiao, 41, has not fought since claim­ing the World Box­ing As­so­ci­a­tion wel­ter­weight crown with a vic­tory over Keith Thur­man in Las Ve­gas in July last year.</p>
    <p>A bout against McGre­gor would guar­an­tee Pac­quiao another lu­cra­tive pay­day as he nears the end of an il­lus­tri­ous box­ing ca­reer.</p>
    <p>De­spite his tech­ni­cal knock­out loss to May­weather in his box­ing de­but, McGre­gor had shown that he was ca­pa­ble of chal­leng­ing “the best box­ers in the world”, Gib­bons said.</p>
    <p>“Our lawyers are fi­nal­is­ing all the con­fi­den­tial de­tails, but both fight­ers are get­ting ready for this one epic last box­ing fight,” Jo­son said.</p>
    <p>Pac­quiao has suc­cess­fully com­bined a po­lit­i­cal ca­reer in the Philip­pines, where he is an elected se­na­tor, while con­tin­u­ing to box at the high­est level. He had turned pro in his teens 25 years ago and owns a 62-7-2 win-loss-draw record with 39 knock­outs.</p>
    <p>“His main fo­cus right now is to help here and there, pro­vid­ing re­lief, shel­ter, money and food, among other ne­ces­si­ties,” Jo­son said.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus has in­fected 301,000 peo­ple in the Philip­pines and killed more than 5,000.</p>
