    <p>Changes to the In­ter­na­tional Ar­bi­tra­tion Act were passed yes­ter­day to en­hance the ar­bi­tra­tion process and hold par­ties to their con­fi­den­tial­ity obli­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>The amend­ments to the Act out­line a new de­fault process for ar­bi­tra­tors to be ap­pointed in dis­putes in­volv­ing more than two par­ties.</p>
    <p>They also ex­plic­itly spell out pow­ers for the High Court and ar­bi­tral tri­bunals to en­force con­fi­den­tial­ity obli­ga­tions be­tween par­ties.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Law Ed­win Tong yes­ter­day said these changes help strengthen Sin­ga­pore’s in­ter­na­tional ar­bi­tra­tion frame­work, and will en­sure the na­tion re­mains an at­trac­tive venue for such ar­bi­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the new de­fault process for ar­bi­tra­tors to be ap­pointed in multi-party dis­putes would “re­duce po­ten­tial de­lay” in con­duct­ing ar­bi­tra­tion pro­ceed­ings, such as when par­ties do not agree on the joint nom­i­na­tion of ar­bi­tra­tors or on third-party ar­bi­tra­tors, he said.</p>
    <p>With the amend­ment, any party can re­quest the ap­point­ing authority to ap­point ar­bi­tra­tors.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, recog­nis­ing the pow­ers of the ar­bi­tral tri­bunal and the High Court to en­force con­fi­den­tial­ity obli­ga­tions un­der­scores the im­por­tance of con­fi­den­tial­ity in ar­bi­tra­tion, Mr Tong added.</p>
    <p>The High Court and ar­bi­tral tri­bunal will be able to make or­ders or give direc­tions to en­force the con­fi­den­tial­ity obli­ga­tions that par­ties and the ar­bi­tral tri­bunal al­ready have a duty to ful­fil.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral MPs wel­comed these amend­ments, in­clud­ing Mr Pa­trick Tay (Pi­o­neer), who noted that the po­ten­tial for dis­putes is rife now, as con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions are be­ing re­struc­tured, sus­pended or ter­mi­nated as a re­sult of the “un­prece­dented im­pact of Covid-19 on global economies”.</p>
    <p>Mr Vikram Nair (Sem­bawang GRC), Mr Louis Ng (Nee Soon GRC) and Mr Zhulka­r­nain Ab­dul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang GRC) also asked that the Law Min­istry im­ple­ment other pro­pos­als that have been put for­ward.</p>
    <p>The two amend­ments passed are among four main pro­pos­als on which the min­istry has been con­sult­ing var­i­ous stake­hold­ers since last year. The oth­ers are a pro­posal al­low­ing par­ties in ar­bi­tral pro­ceed­ings to ap­peal to the High Court on a ques­tion of law aris­ing from the ar­bi­tral award, and a pro­posal to al­low par­ties to agree to waive or limit the an­nul­ment grounds.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhulka­r­nain said Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to face stiff com­pe­ti­tion in at­tract­ing dis­put­ing par­ties, and urged the min­istry to ex­pe­dite the tabling of the other pro­pos­als.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Mr Tong said these are still be­ing stud­ied. “This is a process that is on­go­ing, and we are al­ways tak­ing into ac­count what users want to see, de­vel­op­ments in the law, and of course in­ter­na­tional con­ven­tions and prac­tices as well. We will con­tinue to make Sin­ga­pore an at­trac­tive scene for ar­bi­tra­tion dis­putes.”</p>
