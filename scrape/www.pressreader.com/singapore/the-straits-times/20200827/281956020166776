    <p>NEW YORK • A Michi­gan woman who was de­clared dead by paramedics on Sun­day was dis­cov­ered alive hours later by a fu­neral home worker who was pre­par­ing to em­balm her body, a lawyer for her fam­ily said.</p>
    <p>The lawyer, Mr Ge­of­frey Fieger, said Ms Time­sha Beauchamp was born with cere­bral palsy. “She’s re­quired con­stant care since birth,” he said on Tues­day. “I be­lieve her rel­a­tive frag­ile con­di­tion con­trib­uted to the false be­lief by the au­thor­i­ties” that she had died.</p>
    <p>For Ms Beauchamp’s fam­ily, it has been an ag­o­nis­ing cou­ple of days. First they were told she had died, only to learn later that she was some­how still alive. On Tues­day, she was fight­ing for her life at a Detroit hospi­tal. The or­deal prompted them to hire a lawyer to try to get to the bot­tom of how such a thing could have hap­pened.</p>
    <p>Around 7.30am on Sun­day, paramedics re­sponded to a call about an un­re­spon­sive woman at a home in South­field, Michi­gan, north-west of Detroit, Chief Johnny Menifee of the South­field Fire De­part­ment said in a state­ment. Mr Fieger said at a news con­fer­ence on Tues­day that Ms Beauchamp’s fam­ily had made the emer­gency call.</p>
    <p>When the paramedics ar­rived, they found a 20-year-old woman, later iden­ti­fied as Ms Beauchamp, who was not breath­ing. “The paramedics per­formed car­diopul­monary re­sus­ci­ta­tion and other life-re­viv­ing meth­ods for 30 min­utes,” Mr Menifee said. “Given med­i­cal read­ings and the con­di­tion of the pa­tient, it was de­ter­mined at that time that she did not have signs of life.”</p>
    <p>Later on Sun­day morn­ing, af­ter spend­ing more than two hours in a body bag, Ms Beauchamp ar­rived at the James H. Cole Home for Fu­ner­als, where an em­ployee dis­cov­ered that she was alive, breath­ing with her eyes open, Mr Fieger said.</p>
    <p>The fu­neral home, he said, then called Ms Beauchamp’s mother, Ms Erica Lat­ti­more, and sent Ms Beauchamp to the hospi­tal. “This dev­as­tated my life,” Ms Lat­ti­more told TV sta­tion WDIV.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, the South­field Fire De­part­ment is­sued a sec­ond state­ment. “The South­field Fire and Po­lice De­part­ments fol­lowed all ap­pro­pri­ate city, county and state pro­to­cols and pro­ce­dures in this case,” the de­part­ment said, adding the city was in­ves­ti­gat­ing the mat­ter.</p>
