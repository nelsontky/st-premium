    <p>Hear­ing that lo­cal farm­ers were un­able to sell home-grown pro­duce that was not aes­thet­i­cally pleas­ing, Kenny Eng started</p>
    <p>The Lo­cal Farm’s range of ready-to-eat prod­ucts where it could be used.</p>
    <p>Q What brought your at­ten­tion to food wastage that drove you to do some­thing about it?</p>
    <p>A I was in­spired af­ter hear­ing about lo­cal farm­ers not be­ing able to sell home-grown pro­duce that is con­sid­ered un­usual in size or ugly. This led us to start The Lo­cal Farm’s (TLF) range of ready-to-eat (RTE) prod­ucts made with fresh pro­duce from Sin­ga­pore’s farms.</p>
    <p>Prod­ucts like Egg Story’s dashimaki tam­ago, The Soup Spoon’s as­sam mul­let fish chow­der and Jurong Frog Farm’s snow­drop hashima drink add value to farm­ers’ ef­forts, while at the same time mak­ing it eas­ier for con­sumers to sup­port lo­cal pro­duc­ers. If there are no farm­ers, there is no food.</p>
    <p>Q What about your own home? How do you man­age wastage there?</p>
    <p>A My fam­ily’s be­lief is to buy what is enough to pre­vent wastage. We do not over­stock the fridge or pantry. This way, we do not throw food away. Also, my pas­sion is get­ting con­sumers to buy lo­cal so I buy my sup­plies from the lo­cal farms.</p>
    <p>Q How do you work with lo­cal farm­ers and busi­nesses to cut down on wastage here?</p>
    <p>A Dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic and months of the cir­cuit breaker,</p>
    <p>lo­cal farm­ers suf­fered from the lack of business. That was when we came up with the Sur­vivor Pack, an ini­tia­tive to have farm-fresh pro­duce de­liv­ered to the doorsteps of con­sumers ev­ery week.</p>
    <p>The pack com­prises pas­teurised eggs from N&N Agri­cul­ture, quail eggs from Lian Wah Hang, veg­eta­bles from Yili Veg­e­ta­tion and fish fil­lets from The Fish Farmer. This way, farm­ers do not have to dis­card sur­plus pro­duce that no one is buy­ing. To kick-start the ini­tia­tive, TLF needed to hit 500 or more sub­scribers for a six-month pe­riod to as­sure farm­ers of steady de­mand over a length of time.</p>
    <p>We also as­sure our lo­cal farm­ers with a guar­an­tee of a cer­tain de­mand over a pe­riod of time. But what’s re­ally im­por­tant for us at the Kranji Coun­try­side As­so­ci­a­tion is to sup­port them with our con­fi­dence in their pro­duce.</p>
    <p>Q What were the ini­tial chal­lenges in get­ting the farm­ers and lo­cal busi­nesses to work to­gether to cut waste?</p>
    <p>A One of the chal­lenges is po­ten­tial vol­ume or sales. It is still an up­hill task to get lo­cals to buy lo­cal. With­out the nec­es­sary de­mand, it is dif­fi­cult for farm­ers to even start think­ing of cut­ting waste.</p>
    <p>Q What are the chal­lenges to­day then?</p>
    <p>A That it is eas­ier to be a trader than a grower. This is the big­gest chal­lenge for our in­dus­try, es­pe­cially when we im­port 90 per cent of our food. Yet, we still hold true to the be­lief of “No Farm­ers, No Food”, and that our lo­cal farm­ers are es­sen­tial to Sin­ga­pore’s food sup­ply in the long run.</p>
    <p>Q What do you see in the fu­ture for farm­ers and the re­cy­cling and up­cy­cling of food waste?</p>
    <p>A Farms con­tinue to have huge po­ten­tial, par­tic­u­larly in the RTE and RTC (ready-to-cook) prod­ucts, which have yet to hit Asian coun­tries in a big way, un­like their coun­ter­parts in the United States and Bri­tain. Such prod­ucts, on the one hand, add value to lo­cal farm­ers’ pro­duce, and al­low farm­ers to see bet­ter mar­gins.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, RTE and RTC prod­ucts re­sult in less wastage and this will, hope­fully, mo­ti­vate our farm­ers to con­tinue be­ing a grower, and the in­dus­try to con­tinue at­tract­ing young tal­ents. Ju­dith Tan</p>
