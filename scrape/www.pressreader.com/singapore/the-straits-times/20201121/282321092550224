    <p>When the Seoul Gar­den Group hired in­terns with dis­abil­i­ties for its Har­bourFront out­lets in March, it did not ex­pect that the Covid-19 pan­demic would force the stores to close tem­po­rar­ily.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in­stead of let­ting them go, the restau­rant chain opted to keep the in­terns – who were hired through the SG En­able school-towork tran­si­tion pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>As Covid-19 cases spiked, the firm made the in­terns un­dergo on­line train­ing dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod with the help of SG En­able job coaches. The in­terns re­turned to work at the Har­bourFront out­lets in phase two.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Seoul Gar­den was one of 64 or­gan­i­sa­tions lauded for their in­clu­sive hir­ing prac­tices and rais­ing funds for this year’s Pres­i­dent’s Chal­lenge, de­spite head­winds posed by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Seoul Gar­den Group gen­eral man­ager Garry Lam said that the restau­rant chain sup­ported the in­terns’ train­ing over the course of the year.</p>
    <p>He said: “Af­ter the restau­rants re­opened in phase two, we con­tin­ued work­ing closely with the job coaches to man­age the in­terns’ tran­si­tion back to the out­lets and their adap­ta­tion to the new work pro­cesses.”</p>
    <p>At the an­nual ap­pre­ci­a­tion event yes­ter­day – held vir­tu­ally this year</p>
    <p>– Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob took part in a live chat with donors and vol­un­teers. She said: “Amid this chal­leng­ing time of the pan­demic, the gen­er­ous sup­port of our part­ners has con­trib­uted greatly to up­lift­ing the lives of those less for­tu­nate in our so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>“The Pres­i­dent’s Chal­lenge will con­tinue to fo­cus on help­ing vul­ner­a­ble groups adapt and re­main re­silient, and not be left be­hind. We can all make a dif­fer­ence. It just re­quires a small step from each one of us.”</p>
    <p>Hir­ing peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties has a been a long­stand­ing prac­tice at Seoul Gar­den. Its em­ploy­ees with dis­abil­i­ties have been recog­nised for their con­tri­bu­tions and risen up the ranks – no dif­fer­ent from able-bod­ied staff.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, Seoul Gar­den took up the Pres­i­dent’s Chal­lenge En­abling Em­ploy­ment Pledge, mak­ing a com­mit­ment to adopt an in­clu­sive mind­set, cre­ate a bar­ri­er­free work­place and im­ple­ment sup­port­ive em­ploy­ment poli­cies for em­ploy­ees with dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Fund-rais­ing and vol­un­teer­ing ac­tiv­i­ties were among those af­fected dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, with many or­gan­i­sa­tions find­ing new ways to run the ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Fam­i­lies for Life held a “Red and White” Na­tional Day Desserts cam­paign, where donors re­ceived an e-book­let of dessert recipes, in­clud­ing an agara­gar recipe from the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah said the Pres­i­dent’s Chal­lenge was an im­por­tant na­tional move­ment that helps rally Sin­ga­pore­ans to come to­gether and build a more car­ing and in­clu­sive so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>She said: “Our so­cial, eco­nomic land­scape and peo­ple’s ex­pec­ta­tions and needs have also changed, with greater in­come and job in­se­cu­rity. It is im­por­tant that we em­power our needy with skills and ca­pa­bil­i­ties so that they can live mean­ing­ful lives, se­cure good jobs and con­trib­ute to so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s Chal­lenge is on track to raise more than $12.5 mil­lion this year for 72 agen­cies, and has mo­bilised over 2,000 vol­un­teers from 20 or­gan­i­sa­tions so far.</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah said the fo­cus of next year’s Pres­i­dent’s Chal­lenge would be on build­ing a dig­i­tally in­clu­sive so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>She said: “Covid-19 has ac­cel­er­ated the need for dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion, and Pres­i­dent’s Chal­lenge 2021 will sup­port ef­forts to em­power vul­ner­a­ble groups with dig­i­tal tools, skills and con­nec­tiv­ity for them to re­main so­cially and eco­nom­i­cally ac­tive.</p>
    <p>“I en­cour­age our so­cial ser­vice agen­cies to in­no­vate and adopt dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies to bet­ter nav­i­gate new and com­plex chal­lenges within the so­cial ser­vice sec­tor.”</p>
