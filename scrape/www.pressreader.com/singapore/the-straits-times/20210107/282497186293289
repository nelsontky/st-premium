    <p>The threat of cli­mate change looms large in this play by Aus­tralia-based play­wright An­drew Suther­land.</p>
    <p>It con­sists of sev­eral narratives – a same-sex cou­ple in a rocky re­la­tion­ship, an­other cou­ple who are newly in love, and a sto­ry­line where a god­dess searches for her son and laments her im­pend­ing death. Ot­ters, seag­ulls and sea tur­tles make fre­quent ap­pear­ances.</p>
    <p>“What if we cross that line as we go to­wards that unimag­in­able thought of ex­tinc­tion?” asks direc­tor Koh Wan Ching.</p>
    <p>“How do we hold on to hope? What is hope when we face such im­mi­nent de­struc­tion or era­sure?”</p>
    <p>The work was first per­formed in 2019 by eight stu­dents from the In­ter­cul­tural The­atre In­sti­tute and two guest artistes, to pos­i­tive re­views.</p>
    <p>The lat­est stag­ing, which Koh, 40, de­scribes as “more stream­lined and qui­eter”, fea­tures ac­tors Grace Kalai­selvi, Ir­fan Kas­ban, Jer­amy Lim, Liz Sergeant Tan and Shahid Nasheer. They dou­ble as hu­man and an­i­mal char­ac­ters.</p>
    <p>“You see a much clearer in­ter­con­nec­tion be­tween the hu­man and an­i­mal worlds,” Koh adds.</p>
    <p>The pro­duc­tion was com­ple­mented by two pub­lic work­shops that ended re­cently.</p>
    <p>In­ti­mate Catas­tro­phes, which Suther­land ran on Zoom, looked at var­i­ous ways of re­spond­ing to eco­log­i­cal phe­nom­ena in writ­ing.</p>
    <p>In the other work­shop, Ev­ery­thing Is Con­nected – On De­vis­ing, Koh spoke about how she works with en­vi­ron­men­tal con­cerns in her the­atre-mak­ing.</p>
    <p>What wor­ries her most about the cli­mate cri­sis?</p>
    <p>“I feel there is not enough work be­ing done on mit­i­ga­tion,” she says. “How can we change the way we are func­tion­ing?</p>
    <p>“Can we slowly tran­si­tion our econ­omy to­wards a more care­based one, one that is less fo­cused on pro­duc­tion and eco­nomic devel­op­ment?”</p>
    <p>The­atre, too, has a role to play. “We can’t solve prob­lems, but what we can do is get peo­ple to come to­gether and think about it.</p>
    <p>“The thing about the­atre is to not of­fer so­lu­tions, but ac­knowl­edge that these is­sues are com­plex.”</p>
