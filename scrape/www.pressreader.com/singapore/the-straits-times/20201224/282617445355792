    <p>The cast of ac­tion-fan­tasy flick Mon­ster Hunter had to train hard to be in shape for the film, which is based on a Ja­panese video game se­ries of the same name. It opens in cin­e­mas to­day.</p>
    <p>In in­ter­views with The Straits Times via Zoom, lead­ing ac­tress Milla Jovovich, Thai ac­tor Tony Jaa as well as Bri­tish di­rec­tor and screen­writer Paul W.S. An­der­son share five things about their lat­est project.</p>
    <p>1 EARLY-MORN­ING WORK­OUTS</p>
    <p>Jovovich, known for her science-fic­tion and ac­tion movies such as The Fifth El­e­ment (1997) and the Res­i­dent Evil se­ries (2002 to 2016), woke up at 4am ev­ery day while on set to train for an hour.</p>
    <p>She plays an Amer­i­can army ranger who stum­bles upon a world of gi­gan­tic monsters.</p>
    <p>The 45-year-old Amer­i­can ac­tress, who is mar­ried to An­der­son and has three daugh­ters with him, says she met a fe­male army ranger to pre­pare for her role. The reg­i­mented mil­i­tary life­style of wak­ing up, work­ing out and go­ing on mis­sions in­flu­enced her.</p>
    <p>“Paul would come with me ev­ery morn­ing at 4am to work out for an hour be­fore hair and make-up, and it made me feel in con­trol,” says Jovovich, who gave birth to her youngest child this year.</p>
    <p>2 IT WAS TOUGH FOR FIGHTER TONY JAA</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate in­ter­view, Jaa, 44, re­veals that even with his mar­tial arts back­ground, the filming, es­pe­cially in the desert, was gru­elling. The film was shot in coun­tries such as South Africa and Namibia.</p>
    <p>Jaa (Ong-Bak: Muay Thai War­rior, 2003) plays a mon­ster hunter seek­ing re­venge who teams up with Jovovich’s char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>He says in Thai via a trans­la­tor: “I was car­ry­ing very heavy gear. The ar­mour is 7kg, but I was also car­ry­ing seven other props in­clud­ing a long sword, a dag­ger, a bow and a cross­bow.</p>
    <p>“That made it very dif­fi­cult to run on the sand. More­over, I had to pre­tend to be run­ning away from the gi­gan­tic monsters. My legs must have sunk half­way into the sand at one point, and some­times, I had do up to 20 takes with 30kg on me.”</p>
    <p>3 STAY­ING CLOSE TO VIDEO-GAME ROOTS</p>
    <p>An­der­son took care to en­sure the weapons, monsters and the over­all aes­thetic of the movie did not stray far from the video-game fran­chise.</p>
    <p>He has al­ready carved a niche mak­ing video-game adap­ta­tions such as the Res­i­dent Evil films.</p>
    <p>For Mon­ster Hunter, the 55-year-old di­rec­tor says the game’s devel­op­ers ap­proved the look of the film.</p>
    <p>“Ninety per cent of the movie is set in the Mon­ster Hunter world and fans of the game will recog­nise so much of it. It could not be closer to the game.”</p>
    <p>His re­sponse to fans who got up­set af­ter they saw the movie’s trailer – for seem­ingly fo­cus­ing on Jovovich’s char­ac­ter, who is not in the orig­i­nal video games?</p>
    <p>“Well, that’s the frus­trat­ing thing about trail­ers. They’re only two min­utes long,” he says.</p>
    <p>4 SHOT ON LO­CA­TION</p>
    <p>While com­puter-gen­er­ated im­agery was used for the monsters, An­der­son says he did not want to do the same for the film’s land­scape. So the team headed to South Africa and Namibia.</p>
    <p>He says: “I think (shoot­ing on lo­ca­tion) gives the film a pretty unique look. I wanted to avoid cre­at­ing a world that would look syn­thetic be­cause when I first played the games, there was a real sense of won­der to it.”</p>
    <p>Jovovich adds that this gives the film a the­atri­cal qual­ity best en­joyed in cin­e­mas: “It’s made for the big screen – it’s a roller-coaster ride. We went to the ends of the earth to shoot some of these land­scapes.”</p>
    <p>5 CHEM­ISTRY ON AND OFF-SET</p>
    <p>While it is no sur­prise that</p>
    <p>Jovovich and An­der­son, who have been mar­ried since 2009, would be com­fort­able work­ing with each other, they say they de­vel­oped a nat­u­ral chem­istry with Jaa too.</p>
    <p>An­der­son adds: “I was pleas­antly sur­prised by the qui­eter mo­ments between Milla and Tony. They have great chem­istry to­gether.</p>
    <p>“He’s a very un­der­rated co­me­dian. He has a lot of soul and hu­mour and is won­der­ful to work with on qui­eter mo­ments too.”</p>
    <p>Jovovich jokes: “I keep telling him to call me if he needs an Amer­i­can in his Thai movies.”</p>
    <p>Jaa also felt at ease work­ing with the cou­ple and was not hes­i­tant about shar­ing his ideas for stunts.</p>
    <p>“I adapted Thai styles of fight­ing, with swords and sticks. There was a fight scene with Milla and I showed Paul a few moves and we sort of went from there.”</p>
