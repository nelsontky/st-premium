    <p>As the num­ber of Covid-19 in­fec­tions dwin­dles, the Gov­ern­ment is re­lax­ing the rules on go­ing back to the of­fice, with em­ploy­ers be­ing able to di­rect em­ploy­ees to go in as long as safe mea­sures are ob­served.</p>
    <p>For years, there has been a de­bate on the is­sue of re­mote work­ing, with ad­vo­cates cit­ing time saved on travel, fewer dis­trac­tions and the pos­si­bil­ity of hav­ing shared desks, which would fa­cil­i­tate smaller of­fices and sav­ings on rental and util­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Also, the re­duced pas­sen­ger load on pub­lic trans­port and lighter traf­fic on the roads would re­sult in lower car­bon emis­sions.</p>
    <p>But sadly, many em­ploy­ers did not pro­vide for re­mote work­ing or did not al­low it in prac­tice, even if it was an op­tion in the em­ployee hand­book.</p>
    <p>When Sin­ga­pore en­forced the cir­cuit breaker to stem the spread of Covid-19, it was a bless­ing in dis­guise. Peo­ple wel­comed the op­por­tu­nity to work from home, and many whom I spoke to said they were more pro­duc­tive at home than when they were work­ing in the of­fice.</p>
    <p>They also ben­e­fited from greater work-life bal­ance (an­other is­sue the coun­try has been grap­pling with for years) as a re­sult of the elim­i­na­tion of travel time.</p>
    <p>As we grad­u­ally re­open the coun­try, we should seize the op­por­tu­nity to re­turn to a new nor­mal – that is, one that is en­vi­ron­men­tally sus­tain­able and po­ten­tially more pro­duc­tive.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers should be more proac­tive in pro­mot­ing work-from-home ar­range­ments, rather than al­low­ing it for only a few em­ploy­ees or even re­strict­ing it. Work to­wards out­comes in­stead of be­ing con­cerned with hav­ing staff at their desks for enough hours.</p>
    <p>If em­ploy­ers can be­gin to have such a mind­set, than the na­tional econ­omy and en­vi­ron­ment stand to ben­e­fit.</p>
