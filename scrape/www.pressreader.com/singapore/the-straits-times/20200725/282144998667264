    <p>Hid­den in the genes of sea­weed may be ev­i­dence of the planet’s past ge­o­log­i­cal vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers say that the genes of bull kelp along the shore of New Zealand’s South Is­land bear marks of an earth­quake that oc­curred 800 years ago, when part of the ocean floor rose up­ward and wiped out its in­hab­i­tants.</p>
    <p>That made way for new­com­ers of a dif­fer­ent ge­netic back­ground, the an­ces­tors of to­day’s kelp. The find­ing sug­gests that mo­ments of cat­a­clysmic change in an en­vi­ron­ment can be re­vealed by com­par­ing genes across pop­u­la­tions of some or­gan­isms.</p>
    <p>New Zealand lies atop a nest of fault lines. Af­ter a quake four years ago, the edge of a fault near the town of Kaik­oura shot more than 1.8m out of the wa­ter, and zool­ogy pro­fes­sor Jon Wa­ters at Univer­sity of Otago, and his col­leagues, be­gan to won­der what hap­pened to kelp af­ter such de­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>Those stranded above the high tide line die swiftly, but as the ecosys­tem be­low the wa­ter shifts into a new nor­mal, there is sud­denly a lot of free real es­tate, where new in­di­vid­u­als can sweep in and take over. And be­cause of the way that a pop­u­la­tion of kelp car­pets an area for the long term and makes lit­tle room for new ar­rivals, Pro­fes­sor Wa­ters said, the al­gae pro­vided an ideal test bed for see­ing whether a dis­as­ter’s ef­fects on the gene pool per­sist over time.</p>
    <p>The sci­en­tists took sam­ples of kelp along a 97km stretch of the coast­line near Dunedin, where a sim­i­lar quake hap­pened about 800 years ago. In­di­vid­ual kelp looked much the same but when the sci­en­tists ex­am­ined the ge­net­ics, there were large dif­fer­ences linked to where the kelp had been col­lected. Bull kelp that lived along a 24km stretch that had been forced into the air dur­ing that long-ago earth­quake were dis­tinct from their neigh­bours of the same species on ei­ther side, whose homes had long lain undis­turbed.</p>
    <p>“We were just gob­s­macked,” Prof Wa­ters said. “We could see where the up­lift zone was just by look­ing at the ge­net­ics.”</p>
    <p>When wan­der­ing bull kelp from far­ther down the coast ar­rived at the waste­land left by the quake, they likely pro­lif­er­ated swiftly, dom­i­nat­ing the en­tire foot­print of the up­lifted area within a few decades, be­fore any oth­ers could get in. Their de­scen­dants are still liv­ing there. Their pres­ence is a sign of an an­cient dis­rup­tion but also of re­newal.</p>
    <p>“One of the things we learnt from this is how quickly na­ture re­cov­ers,” Prof Wa­ters said. “It’s re­as­sur­ing that na­ture has that power.”</p>
    <p>The work cor­rob­o­rates the idea that af­ter ecosys­tems re­cover from catas­tro­phes, the ge­netic make-up of the or­gan­isms there can bear sig­na­tures of the change for hun­dreds of years or longer.</p>
