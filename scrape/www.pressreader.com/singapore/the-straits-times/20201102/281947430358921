    <p>It’s al­ways as­sumed that those of us who felt cer­tain of pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Hil­lary Clin­ton’s vic­tory in 2016 were put­ting too much trust in polls. I was put­ting too much trust in Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>I’d seen Amer­i­cans err. I’d watched us stray. Still I didn’t think that enough of us would in­dulge a would-be leader as proudly hate­ful, patently fraud­u­lent and flam­boy­antly dis­hon­est as Mr Don­ald Trump. We had episodes of ug­li­ness, but this? No way. We were bet­ter than Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Ex­cept, it turned out, we weren’t.</p>
    <p>Never mind that the Rus­sians gave him a boost. Or that he lost the pop­u­lar vote.</p>
    <p>Some 46 per cent of the Amer­i­cans who cast bal­lots for pres­i­dent in 2016 picked him, and as he moved into the White House and pro­ceeded to soil it, most of those Amer­i­cans stood by him solidly enough that Repub­li­cans in Con­gress didn’t dare to cross him and in fact went to great, con­science-im­mo­lat­ing lengths to prop him up.</p>
    <p>Th­ese law­mak­ers weren’t swoon­ing for a dem­a­gogue. They were read­ing the pop­u­lace. And it was a pop­u­lace I didn’t recog­nise, or at least didn’t want to.</p>
    <p>LOSS OF IN­NO­CENCE</p>
    <p>What has Mr Trump’s pres­i­dency taken from us? I’m rea­son­ably sure that many Amer­i­cans feel the same loss that I do, and I’m strug­gling to as­sign just one word to it. In­no­cence? Op­ti­mism? Faith?</p>
    <p>Go to the place on the Venn di­a­gram where those states of mind over­lap. That’s the piece of me now miss­ing when I look at this beloved coun­try of mine.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Trump snuffed out my con­fi­dence, flick­er­ing but real, that we could go only so low and for­give only so much. With him we went lower – or at least a damn­ingly large per­cent­age of us did.</p>
    <p>In him we for­gave florid cru­elty, overt racism, ram­pant cor­rup­tion, ex­ul­tant in­de­cency, the cod­dling of mur­der­ous despots, the alien­ation of true friends, the alien­ation of truth it­self, the dis­par­age­ment of in­valu­able in­sti­tu­tions, the degra­da­tion of es­sen­tial demo­cratic tra­di­tions.</p>
    <p>He played Rus­sian roulette with Amer­i­cans’ lives. He played Rus­sian roulette with his own aides’ lives.</p>
    <p>In a sane and civil coun­try, of the kind I long thought I lived in, his favoura­bil­ity rat­ings would have fallen to neg­a­tive in­te­gers, a math­e­mat­i­cal im­pos­si­bil­ity but a moral im­per­a­tive. In this one, they never changed all that much.</p>
    <p>UN­SHAKE­ABLE FAITH IN TRUMP</p>
    <p>Polls from mid-Oc­to­ber showed that about 44 per cent of vot­ers ap­proved of Mr Trump’s job per­for­mance – and this was af­ter he’d con­cealed as­pects of his coron­avirus in­fec­tion from the public, shrugged off the larger mean­ing of it, es­tab­lished the White House as its own su­per-spreader en­v­i­ron</p>
    <p>ment and cav­a­lierly marched on. Forty-four per cent.</p>
    <p>Who in God’s name are we? I’m not for­get­ting pre-Trump Amer­i­can his­tory. I’m not eras­ing hun­dreds of years of slav­ery, the in­tern­ment of Ja­panese Amer­i­cans, the many kinds of dis­crim­i­na­tion that have flour­ished in my own life­time, all the elec­tions in which we Amer­i­cans made stupid choices and all the pres­i­dents who did “unAmer­i­can” things.</p>
    <p>We’re a grossly im­per­fect coun­try, our be­hav­iour at fre­quent odds with our ideals. But for ev­ery abom­i­na­tion, I could name a mo­ment of grace. For many of our sins, stabs at atone­ment. We demon­strated a yearn­ing to cor­rect our mis­takes and, I think, a tropism to­ward good­ness. On bal­ance we were open, gen­er­ous.</p>
    <p>When I trav­elled abroad, peo­ple from other coun­tries rou­tinely com­pli­mented Amer­i­cans for that. They ex­pe­ri­enced us as ar­ro­gant, but also as spe­cial. Now they just pity us.</p>
    <p>How much of this can we pin on Mr Trump? Not as much as we try to. And oh, how we’ve tried.</p>
    <p>A DE­FLEC­TION</p>
    <p>This ob­ses­sion of the news me­dia and his de­trac­tors with ev­ery last ec­cen­tric­ity and inanity isn’t just about keep­ing a com­plete record, I’ve come to re­alise.</p>
    <p>It’s also a de­flec­tion, an eva­sion: If he gets the whole of the stage, then Amer­i­cans’ com­plic­ity and col­lab­o­ra­tion are shoved into the wings. And the freakier we make him out to be, the less em­blem­atic he is. The more he be­comes a ran</p>
    <p>dom, iso­lated event.</p>
    <p>We em­pha­sised what a van­quish­able op­po­nent Mrs Clin­ton was be­cause that di­min­ished the sig­nif­i­cance of the van­quish­ing and the van­quisher. We spoke of a per­fect storm of cir­cum­stances that led to his elec­tion as a way of dis­own­ing the weather.</p>
    <p>We cheered on Mr Robert Mueller’s in­ves­ti­ga­tion not just be­cause it might hold Mr Trump and his wretched ac­com­plices to ac­count but also be­cause it might ex­plain him away, prov­ing that he reached the White House by cheat­ing, not be­cause he was what nearly half of the coun­try de­cided that they wanted.</p>
    <p>We tried to make him a one-and­done one-off.</p>
    <p>But deep into his pres­i­dency, when his ex­e­crable char­ac­ter had been fully ex­posed, his Fox News cheer­lead­ers con­tin­ued to draw huge au­di­ences for their syco­phan­tic pan­e­gyrics.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump him­self con­tin­ued to at­tract big crowds to his ral­lies, like the one in Greenville, North Carolina, in July last year, when he pressed his at­tack on four Demo­cratic con­gress­women of colour, in­clud­ing Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Il­han Omar, who im­mi­grated from So­ma­lia. Egged on by him, his au­di­ence chanted: “Send her back! Send her back!” He stopped speak­ing to give those words room, and he soaked them in.</p>
    <p>Or what about the re­cent rally in Muskegon, Michi­gan, where he freshly as­sailed the state’s gov­er­nor, Ms Gretchen Whit­mer, de­spite the fact that his ob­ses­sive de­nun­ci­a­tions of her had pos­si­bly been a fac­tor in an al­leged plot by 14 men to kid­nap her? “Lock her up!” many of the at­ten­dees bel­lowed, to Mr Trump’s ob­vi­ous amuse­ment.</p>
    <p>FALSE HOPES, FER­TILE GROUND</p>
    <p>Again, how has his ap­proval rat­ing not fallen to neg­a­tive in­te­gers? I’m not say­ing that sup­port for him is spun en­tirely of mal­ice or bias. Keen eco­nomic anx­i­ety and pro­found po­lit­i­cal es­trange­ment are why many vot­ers turned to him, as my New York Times col­league Farah Stock­man ex­plained es­pe­cially well in a re­cent edi­to­rial that was set in Amer­ica’s dis­heart­ened heart­land.</p>
    <p>“Even false hope,” she noted, “is a form of hope, per­haps the most ubiq­ui­tous kind.” The head­line on</p>
    <p>the ar­ti­cle was “Why they loved him”.</p>
    <p>But why haven’t more of them stopped lov­ing him? And how did so many Amer­i­cans be­yond that group fall so hard for him, thrilling to his reck­less­ness, ap­plaud­ing his di­vi­sive­ness, in­dulging his un­scrupu­lous­ness?</p>
    <p>He tapped into more cyn­i­cism and ni­hilism than this land of bound­less to­mor­rows was sup­posed to con­tain. He tapped into more con­spir­a­to­ri­al­ism, too. And I do mean “tapped”.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump didn’t draw out any­thing that wasn’t al­ready there, bur­bling be­neath the sur­face. He didn’t sire white su­prem­a­cists. He didn’t script the dark fan­tasies of QAnon. He didn’t cre­ate all the Amer­i­cans who re­belled against pro­tec­tive masks and mocked those who wore them, a self­ish mind­set that helps ex­plain our tragic lot.</p>
    <p>It just flour­ished un­der him. And it will al­most cer­tainly sur­vive him.</p>
    <p>The foul spirit of th­ese past five years – I’m in­clud­ing his hate­ful cam­paign – has been both per­va­sive and strangely proud. That’s what makes it dif­fer­ent. That’s what makes it so chill­ing. I could be over­re­act­ing.</p>
    <p>Maybe, just ahead, there will be mo­ments of grace, enough of them to re­deem us. Maybe I’ll look up on or af­ter to­mor­row and see that Mr Joe Bi­den has won North Carolina, has won Michi­gan, has won ev­ery closely con­tested state and the pres­i­dency in a land­slide.</p>
    <p>Maybe I’ll have to eat my words. Please, my fel­low Amer­i­cans, feed me my words. I’d rel­ish that meal.</p>
    <p>Keen eco­nomic anx­i­ety and pro­found po­lit­i­cal es­trange­ment are why many vot­ers turned to him, as my New York Times col­league Farah Stock­man ex­plained es­pe­cially well in a re­cent edi­to­rial that was set in Amer­ica’s dis­heart­ened heart­land. “Even false hope,” she noted, “is a form of hope, per­haps the most ubiq­ui­tous kind.” The head­line on the ar­ti­cle was “Why they loved him”.</p>
