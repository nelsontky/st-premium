    <p>Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob has con­demned dis­crim­i­na­tion at the work­place, say­ing it is par­tic­u­larly dis­turb­ing dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic and has no place in Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ety. She was re­fer­ring to a re­cent in­ci­dent where a sales pro­moter was told by Tangs depart­ment store to re­move her hi­jab to work there.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob has con­demned in strong terms dis­crim­i­na­tion at the work­place, say­ing it is par­tic­u­larly dis­turb­ing dur­ing the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>“Dis­crim­i­na­tion of any form and against any­one has no place at all in our so­ci­ety,” she said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She was re­fer­ring to a re­cent in­ci­dent when a 20-year-old sales pro­moter was told by Tangs depart­ment store to re­move her hi­jab to work there.</p>
    <p>Such in­ci­dents, Madam Hal­imah added, will add to the anx­i­ety of peo­ple al­ready grap­pling with con­cerns over their jobs and liveli­hoods.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple should be as­sessed solely on their mer­its and their abil­ity to do a job and noth­ing else,” she said.</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah’s re­marks, in a Face­book post as well as to re­porters who asked her about the in­ci­dent dur­ing her visit to char­i­ta­ble or­gan­i­sa­tion AMP Sin­ga­pore yes­ter­day, said Tangs has since agreed to re­move such re­stric­tions and will al­low the hi­jab to be worn at work.</p>
    <p>A Tangs spokesman told The Straits Times on Wed­nes­day that its cor­po­rate of­fice col­leagues and back of house em­ploy­ees wear re­li­gious head­gear, and that they plan to stan­dard­ise this prac­tice across the stores for all.</p>
    <p>Wel­com­ing the move, Madam Hal­imah said: “Di­ver­sity is our strength and our so­ci­ety has al­ready em­braced it. I hope that em­ploy­ers too will fully em­brace di­ver­sity at the work­place and do their part to up­hold the val­ues of a fair and open so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>On July 29, part-time hand­bag pro­moter Nurin Ja­zlina Mah­bob had been work­ing at a pop-up booth on the sec­ond floor of Tangs at Tang Plaza in Or­chard Road when she was asked by staff of the depart­ment store to re­move her head scarf. It was her first day on the job.</p>
    <p>Ms Ja­zlina, 20, told ST two fe­male Tangs man­agers told her that she could not work in the store with a hi­jab on, as the com­pany did not al­low staff to wear any head­gear.</p>
    <p>The man­agers then ex­plained to her that re­mov­ing her hi­jab was “for the sake of pro­fes­sion­al­ism”.</p>
    <p>“Ask­ing me to re­move my hi­jab in pub­lic is a per­sonal in­sult. Wear­ing a hi­jab is not only re­quired by my re­li­gion, it is also a sym­bol of my mod­esty,” she said.</p>
    <p>After the in­ci­dent, Ms Ja­zlina’s em­ployer, who wanted to be known only as Ms Chin and had hired her to run her booth, posted about it on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>She said that the rules Tangs had were “very ridicu­lous”, adding: “The last thing we need is dis­crim­i­na­tion and un­fair treat­ment my part-timer and I were put through.”</p>
    <p>Ms Ja­zlina said she was thank­ful Ms Chin spoke up for her and for the change in Tangs’ pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Ms Chin, 36, told ST she was grate­ful for the sup­port and aware­ness her post had raised, say­ing: “We have been brought up to be a har­mo­nious coun­try, re­spect­ing one an­other... I hope we can all push for a fair and open so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent, and reports on it, also drew re­sponses from mem­bers of the pub­lic, as well as Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Man­power and De­fence Zaqy Mo­hamad.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post on Wed­nes­day evening, Mr Zaqy said em­ploy­ers should be thought­ful of the poli­cies and prac­tices they set, and urged them to take into con­sid­er­a­tion the views and sen­si­tiv­i­ties of their em­ploy­ees, cus­tomers and busi­ness part­ners.</p>
    <p>“The Tri­par­tite Guide­lines on Fair Em­ploy­ment Prac­tices make it clear that re­cruit­ment and hir­ing are to be based on merit and the abil­ity to per­form the job,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Re­li­gious at­tire should gen­er­ally be al­lowed at work­places, un­less em­ploy­ers have uni­form or dress­code re­quire­ments which are suited to the na­ture of their work, or for op­er­a­tional and safety rea­sons.</p>
    <p>“It is im­por­tant for em­ploy­ers to com­mu­ni­cate their uni­form pol­icy or dress code clearly and sen­si­tively to their em­ploy­ees and job­seek­ers and their stake­hold­ers,” he added.</p>
    <p>On the Tangs in­ci­dent, he added that the Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Fair and Pro­gres­sive Em­ploy­ment Prac­tices – the na­tional dis­crim­i­na­tion watch­dog – has con­tacted the par­ties in­volved and is cur­rently look­ing into the mat­ter.</p>
