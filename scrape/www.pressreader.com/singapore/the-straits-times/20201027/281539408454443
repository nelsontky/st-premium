    <p>Ja­pan yes­ter­day pledged to build a car­bon-neu­tral “green so­ci­ety” by 2050, mark­ing a par­a­digm shift for the world’s fifth-largest green­house gas emit­ter. The pledge will bring Ja­pan in line with the Euro­pean Union’s 2050 goal.</p>
    <p>TOKYO • Op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers are to grill Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga on a con­tro­versy over aca­demic free­doms in the Diet ses­sion that opened yes­ter­day and will last un­til Dec 5.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s academia has been up­set by Mr Suga’s un­prece­dented omis­sion of six nom­i­nated schol­ars from the Sci­ence Coun­cil of Ja­pan in what has long been a rub­ber-stamp process. All six had op­posed the poli­cies of Mr Suga’s pre­de­ces­sor Shinzo Abe.</p>
    <p>The saga has hurt Mr Suga’s ap­proval rat­ings, which fell 11 per­cent­age points in a week­end poll by the Nikkei and TV Tokyo from a month ago, though it is still healthy, at 63 per cent.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers are also set to ques­tion Mr Suga on the gov­ern­ment’s Covid-19 pan­demic re­sponse dur­ing the Diet sit­ting, even though Ja­pan has avoided the soar­ing num­bers other coun­tries have had.</p>
    <p>It re­ported 406 new in­fec­tions yes­ter­day, bring­ing its to­tal tally to 98,327, though Hokkaido and Miyagi pre­fec­tures posted new daily highs over the past week.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga has pri­ori­tised the re­open­ing of the econ­omy, such as the multi­bil­lion-dol­lar Go To cam­paign to en­cour­age do­mes­tic travel. Just dozens have been in­fected out of the more than 25 mil­lion trav­ellers who tapped the sub­si­dies, he said.</p>
    <p>The Prime Min­is­ter has vowed to se­cure enough vac­cines for all Ja­pan res­i­dents by next June, and said he will push ahead for the Olympics to be held.</p>
