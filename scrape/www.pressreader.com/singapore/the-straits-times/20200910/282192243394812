    <p>China Life In­sur­ance (Sin­ga­pore) will soon be able to serve in­di­vid­ual cus­tomers di­rectly as it aims to hire at least 500 con­sul­tants in the next five years.</p>
    <p>The in­surer, which cur­rently sells its prod­ucts through fi­nan­cial com­pa­nies and banks, will re­cruit these con­sul­tants in var­i­ous en­try- and se­nior-level po­si­tions from Oct 1. This will take place through its Agency Chan­nel project, which it launched on Mon­day. China Life Sin­ga­pore has more than 60 em­ploy­ees in cor­po­rate roles.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive Lin Xiangyang told The Straits Times that the in­surer aims to amass 30,000 to 50,000 cus­tomers in the next five years through the ini­tia­tive. He noted that there is still a high de­mand for in­sur­ance, es­pe­cially health and re­tire­ment plan­ning prod­ucts, de­spite the eco­nomic down­turn, and that the in­surer launched the Agency Chan­nel to bet­ter meet cus­tomer needs.</p>
    <p>“We have ab­so­lute faith in Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic prospects and be­lieve that the lo­cal econ­omy will restart and emerge strong within the next one to two years. There­fore, the Agency Chan­nel is a pre­emp­tive five-year plan in an­tic­i­pa­tion of the pro­jected ro­bust de­mand for in­sur­ance dur­ing the sub­se­quent eco­nomic re­bound,” said Mr Lin.</p>
    <p>He added that the in­surer will hire con­sul­tants from var­i­ous back­grounds, in­clud­ing those con­sid­er­ing a mid-ca­reer switch, fresh grad­u­ates and “elite tal­ent” within the fi­nan­cial ser­vices in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>All con­sul­tants will need to pass the rel­e­vant ex­ams of­fered by the Sin­ga­pore Col­lege of In­sur­ance and will also go through a 90-day in-house train­ing pro­gramme. “Out­stand­ing con­sul­tants will be given a well-es­tab­lished plat­form to re­ceive guid­ance in man­age­ment and other re­lated skills,” said China Life Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>It added that its in­sur­ance plans – in­clud­ing pro­tec­tion plans, en­dow­ments, in­vest­ment-linked in­sur­ance plans and hy­brid plans – are “highly cus­tomis­able to of­fer value-added fi­nan­cial so­lu­tions to cus­tomers” to meet their risk pro­tec­tion, re­tire­ment, wealth man­age­ment and legacy plan­ning needs.</p>
    <p>Through the Agency Chan­nel project, China Life Sin­ga­pore also aims to con­nect China to Sin­ga­pore’s in­sur­ance mar­ket, cre­ate in­sur­ance tech­nol­ogy so­lu­tions and nur­ture tal­ent in the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Head of agency de­part­ment Jerome Png said: “Our dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion projects in the next few years will help el­e­vate the cus­tomer ex­pe­ri­ence jour­ney, which will dove­tail nicely with our con­sul­tants’ nat­u­ral hu­man touch, achiev­ing a nice bal­ance.”</p>
