    <p>The At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) is de­vel­op­ing guide­lines on how to prop­erly value al­legedly stolen items, after it emerged dur­ing the Parti Liyani trial that the value of cer­tain items was in­flated by the com­plainants.</p>
    <p>Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam told Par­lia­ment this is one of two ar­eas the AGC has iden­ti­fied that needs im­prove­ment, after re­view­ing its ac­tions in the trial where the for­mer maid was ac­quit­ted of all theft charges on Sept 4.</p>
    <p>He also stressed that the prose­cu­tion’s over­ar­ch­ing role is to en­sure that jus­tice is done, and not to “win the case at all costs”.</p>
    <p>“This point is not be­ing made by ref­er­ence to this case. It is a gen­eral point,” said Mr Shan­mugam.</p>
    <p>He noted that At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Lu­cien Wong has pub­licly stressed this on many oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>“AGC has con­sis­tently em­pha­sised this point to all its of­fi­cers, and will con­tinue to do so.”</p>
    <p>De­liv­er­ing a min­is­te­rial state­ment on the case of Ms Parti, Mr Shan­mugam ac­knowl­edged that in­de­pen­dent assess­ment of the value of the items “may have helped” for some of the items in this case, as prosecutor­s had de­rived the value by re­ly­ing on the Liew fam­ily’s es­ti­mates.</p>
    <p>This has been the gen­eral prac­tice for the val­u­a­tion of items and there are no for­mal guide­lines, said Mr Shan­mugam, adding that prosecutor­s are ex­pected to use their “judg­ment and dis­cre­tion”.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the trial, the court had found that the value of some of the items had been “over­es­ti­mated”, in­clud­ing a Ger­ald Genta watch that was orig­i­nally priced at $25,000 by the prose­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Karl Liew, the son of for­mer Changi Air­port Group chair­man Liew Mun Leong, had claimed the watch was worth that much, based on his own “im­pres­sion”, even though the strap was bro­ken and it had a miss­ing but­ton knob.</p>
    <p>A wit­ness called by the de­fence placed its cur­rent value at $500 in­stead, adding that the date func­tion was faulty.</p>
    <p>The worth of the watch was even­tu­ally re­duced by the court to $10,000.</p>
    <p>Mr Liew also told prosecutor­s that a Helix watch was worth $50, but a horol­o­gist who was called to the stand tes­ti­fied that the watch was a free gift from Shell.</p>
    <p>All such rel­e­vant phys­i­cal ex­hibits should have been shown to wit­nesses be­fore they take the stand, said Mr Shan­mugam. He fur­ther noted that the Liew fam­ily was mostly shown pho­to­graphs of the ex­hibits dur­ing wit­ness in­ter­views.</p>
    <p>On ex­hibits, the High Court judge also said that prosecutor­s should have fully dis­closed the de­fect found in a $1,000 DVD player Ms Parti was ac­cused of steal­ing dur­ing the trial. The prose­cu­tion con­ceded that it had some dif­fi­cul­ties play­ing a DVD disc with the ma­chine only in the ap­peal stage.</p>
    <p>This el­e­ment proved cru­cial in sup­port­ing Ms Parti’s point that the DVD player was “spoilt” and the High Court judge found that it was likely that the Liews no longer wanted the player.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said the mat­ter is now the sub­ject of dis­ci­plinary pro­ceed­ings, where a full ac­count of what the prosecutor­s did will be given, and hence he would re­frain from com­ment­ing on it.</p>
