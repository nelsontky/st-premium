    <p>Sin­ga­pore will uni­lat­er­ally lift bor­der re­stric­tions to vis­i­tors from Aus­tralia – ex­clud­ing Vic­to­ria state – and Viet­nam from Oct 8.</p>
    <p>The Civil Avi­a­tion Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (CAAS) said yes­ter­day both coun­tries have com­pre­hen­sive pub­lic health sur­veil­lance sys­tems and have suc­cess­fully con­trolled the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“The risk of im­por­ta­tion from th­ese coun­tries is low,” it said, not­ing that over the last 28 days, Viet­nam had zero lo­cal Covid-19 cases while Aus­tralia (ex­clud­ing Vic­to­ria state) had a low virus in­ci­dence rate of 0.02 cases per 100,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>They join New Zealand and Brunei as the four coun­tries Sin­ga­pore has uni­lat­er­ally opened its bor­ders to, as the coun­try seeks to re­vive its air­port and tourism sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors from Aus­tralia and Viet­nam can ap­ply for the Air Travel Pass for en­try into Sin­ga­pore from 12pm to­day. The ear­li­est day they will be able to en­ter is Oct 8.</p>
    <p>The Air Travel Pass scheme al­lows for all forms of short-term travel, in­clud­ing leisure travel. This is in con­trast to re­cip­ro­cal green lane ar­range­ments, which are usu­ally for es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial travel. Vis­i­tors will have to take a swab test upon ar­rival, and can go about their ac­tiv­i­ties af­ter they get a neg­a­tive test re­sult. They will have to use the TraceTo­gether app while they are here, among other con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>CAAS also said that Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens, per­ma­nent res­i­dents and long-term pass hold­ers re­turn­ing from Aus­tralia (ex­clud­ing Vic­to­ria state) and Viet­nam will be able to take a Covid-19 test upon ar­rival. This will re­place the re­quire­ment of a seven-day stay-home no­tice with a test be­fore the end of the no­tice.</p>
    <p>Since re­stric­tions on vis­i­tors from Brunei and New Zealand were lifted on Sept 8, CAAS has ap­proved 331 ap­pli­ca­tions from such trav­ellers. As at 5pm yes­ter­day, 136 vis­i­tors have ar­rived. None of them tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 upon ar­rival.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said he has spo­ken to Mr Michael McCor­mack, Aus­tralia’s Deputy Prime Min­is­ter, and Mrs Tao Thi Than Huong, Viet­nam’s Am­bas­sador to Sin­ga­pore, about the move.</p>
    <p>“They were ap­pre­cia­tive of Sin­ga­pore’s de­ci­sion, and when con­di­tions are right, I be­lieve they will con­sider re­cip­ro­cat­ing the lift­ing of re­stric­tions to trav­ellers from Sin­ga­pore,” he said.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors will have to take a swab test upon ar­rival, and can go about their ac­tiv­i­ties af­ter they get a neg­a­tive test re­sult. They will have to use the TraceTo­gether app while here, among other con­di­tions.</p>
