    <p>A grumpy cho­rus of “Why can’t I con­tinue to use just SafeEn­try/SingPass/NRIC” arose among Straits Times Face­book users in re­sponse to the up­com­ing roll-out of TraceTo­gether-only SafeEn­try.</p>
    <p>It’s amaz­ing how at­tached we can be­come to a sys­tem that’s just a few months old. KDsquared Chewchew asked: “The ques­tion is why? SafeEn­try was so awe­some with the abil­ity to check in my kids and spouse. Now can TT app do that as well?”</p>
    <p>Cle­ment Chio said: “TraceTo­gether check-in is so prim­i­tive com­pared to the SingPass ver­sion. I can’t check in mul­ti­ple peo­ple nor use it as a short­cut. Catch up, TT!”</p>
    <p>NOT OP­TIONAL</p>
    <p>By the end of De­cem­ber, check­ing in with the TraceTo­gether app or to­ken will be manda­tory at all pub­lic venues in Sin­ga­pore, in­clud­ing restau­rants, work­places, schools and shop­ping malls. This was an­nounced last Tues­day by the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling Covid-19.</p>
    <p>There are cur­rently sev­eral op­tions for check­ing in with SafeEn­try, such as by scan­ning the SafeEn­try QR code with a phone cam­era or the SingPass mo­bile app, or the bar­codes on the NRIC. We will no longer be able to do any of these once TraceTo­gether-only SafeEn­try is im­ple­mented.</p>
    <p>Manda­tory TraceTo­gether check-ins will kick off at cinemas from to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>NOT PRE­CISE ENOUGH</p>
    <p>Some ST Face­book read­ers tried to ex­plain to the an­noyed ones why there is a need for a TraceTo­gether app or to­ken.</p>
    <p>KDsquared Chewchew, who’s rather at­tached to us­ing just SafeEn­try, said: “They have the time and venue of where they checked in. Isn’t that good enough? If SafeEn­try de­tected I had scanned in (at) the same venue and same tim­ing as a Covid-19 per­son, I will be ob­serv­ing my­self for the next 14 days.”</p>
    <p>Jin­mei Tan replied: “KDsquared Chewchew, but if you were to be in close con­tact with the in­fected per­son based on the sig­nal strength via TraceTo­gether, you’ll be im­me­di­ately con­tacted for iso­la­tion to pre­vent fur­ther spread.”</p>
    <p>Tamil Selvi wrote: “What is wrong with SafeEn­try that we’ve been us­ing for more than six months? Forc­ing the pub­lic to ac­cept an app or to­ken at al­most phase three is ut­ter non­sense.”</p>
    <p>Alvin Ng Heng San re­sponded by say­ing: “QR code scan­ning is not a per­fect sys­tem. Lots of peo­ple who sign in don’t bother to sign out. So at the end of the day, there are lots of du­pli­cated in­put when peo­ple move around here and there, over­whelm the sys­tem with data that can­not be ef­fec­tively used.”</p>
    <p>He did say that the TraceTo­gether app is “not a per­fect sys­tem as it re­quires other users to also in­stall the app, and we have to keep Blue­tooth on, which zaps the bat­tery power”.</p>
    <p>Kelly Chan also pointed out that “SafeEn­try will only check you into a place, whereas the (TraceTo­gether) app/to­ken will show data if you’re be­side the (Covid-19-pos­i­tive) per­son if they have the app/to­ken”.</p>
    <p>San­dra LB had an­other take on why the to­ken is use­ful: It could be more user-friendly for the tech-chal­lenged. “It is for the el­derly like my mum and my mother-in-law who don’t use HP.”</p>
    <p>NOT TAKEN BY THE TO­KEN</p>
    <p>Chew Ben­jamin, who used strong words which are not in­cluded here, said of the to­ken: “Come on. This means that for the ter­ri­bly ab­sent-minded, they have got to not only re­mem­ber to mask up but also to bring this thing every­where they go.</p>
    <p>“What if my older chil­dren mis­place them? What if my three-year-old, who is al­ways up to some dev­ilry, pinches this ‘toy’ from his older sib­lings and hides it some­where, or even flings it out of the win­dow? Would we be barred from en­ter­ing any pub­lic space then, with no ex­cep­tions, by zeal­ous, rule-fol­low­ing crack­pots?”</p>
    <p>LY Lee, who is also un­happy with the to­ken, said: “Id­i­otic to have to col­lect this thing. SafeEn­try via mo­bile phone for so many months and now some­thing new to bring. I’ve for­got­ten to bring the mask out sev­eral times and now this stupid thing as well.”</p>
    <p>Kim Min U kept his an­swer to their woes short and sweet. “Can use the app, you know?”</p>
    <p>If you are us­ing the TraceTo­gether app, you do not need the to­ken.</p>
    <p>Gabriel Sim kept his an­swer less short and less sweet. “LY Lee, ya don’t need. Ya just bring your stupid HP (with the TraceTo­gether app) at all times.”</p>
