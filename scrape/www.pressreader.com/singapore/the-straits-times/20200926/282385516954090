    <p>Like most, trainer Michael Clements knows In­ferno is very hard to beat in to­day’s $400,000 Group 1 Sin­ga­pore Guineas over 1,600m in Race 12.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, the Cliff Brown-trained six-time win­ner from seven starts, in­clud­ing the $250,000 Group 2 Sin­ga­pore Clas­sic over 1,400m at his last start on Aug 30, is hailed as Kranji’s next big thing.</p>
    <p>But Clements is still op­ti­mistic that his aptly named charge, Big Hearted, has what it takes to win, although In­ferno has fin­ished ahead in their four pre­vi­ous en­coun­ters.</p>
    <p>Those were over 1,200m and 1,400m, so Clements reck­ons the step-up to 1,600m will be ideal for his Fal­con Rac­ing No. 7 Stable­owned come-from-be­hind four­time win­ner.</p>
    <p>His horse has also peaked at the right time.</p>
    <p>“I’ve al­ways rated Big Hearted and felt the fur­ther he gets to go, the more we’re go­ing to see from him, es­pe­cially as he strength­ens up and ma­tures,” said Clements, who three weeks ago cap­tured the $500,000 Group 1 Sin­ga­pore Derby with Fal­con Rac­ing’s Top Knight.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally like to have him at the trip. It’ll be his first time over the mile, but so will most of them, in­clud­ing In­ferno.</p>
    <p>“If any­thing, the mile has come at the right time with the ex­tra six months for him to ma­ture dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.”</p>
    <p>Clements knows that at l evel weights, Big Hearted is dis­ad­van­taged, but it is the ideal race with the small field of nine.</p>
    <p>He hopes, with a good pas­sage, Big Hearted can fin­ish strongly. Af­ter all, his horse is ready to run the race of his life.</p>
    <p>“He’s in great shape and I’m re­ally pleased with his prepa­ra­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>“He had a good gal­lop early this week. He’s a sound horse, clean­winded and easy to train.</p>
    <p>“In­ferno is the horse to beat, no doubt. But I’m qui­etly con­fi­dent my horse will run a de­cent race and fin­ish in the first three.</p>
    <p>“He’s my Guineas horse from a long way out and he has peaked at the right time.”</p>
    <p>Big Hearted will be rid­den by French jockey Louis-Philippe Beuzelin.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Guineas race has lost some glam­our with the with­drawal of six-time win­ner Mr Malek, the horse most thought would be In­ferno’s big­gest threat.</p>
    <p>Trainer Lee Freed­man scratched the Os­car Rac­ing Sta­ble-owned gal­loper be­cause he was not 100 per cent sat­is­fied with his charge’s con­di­tion af­ter his fi­nal gal­lop on Wed­nes­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>While the Aus­tralian Hall of Fame trainer is left with­out a Sin­ga­pore Guineas run­ner, Os­car Rac­ing will still be rep­re­sented by the James Peters-trained two-time win­ner Meryl, the only mare in the race.</p>
    <p>Although win­ning would be a pipedream with her low rat­ing, she has to be in it to win it.</p>
    <p>“It’s re­al­is­ti­cally very, very tough for Meryl, es­pe­cially with In­ferno in the race, but the Guineas is run only once,” said Peters, who has booked jockey Wong Chin Chuen for the ride.</p>
    <p>“We’ll take our chance, you never know. She’s won well over the mile, and hope­fully, she can run into the money.”</p>
