    <p>Red Lions para­chute team mem­bers wav­ing to the crowd af­ter land­ing at a grass patch in Toh Guan Road dur­ing the Na­tional Day Pa­rade (NDP) re­hearsal yes­ter­day. As the Red Lions glided through the air, peo­ple in Jurong East and Sengkang cheered and clapped, as they were treate d to smooth land­ings from six of the Sin­ga­pore Army’s parachutis­ts at each of the two sites. The sky­dive ma­noeu­vre – a crowd-pleaser at ev­ery NDP – will take place over the heart­land in this year’s cel­e­bra­tions, which have had to be mod­i­fied due to the coronaviru­s pan­demic. The Red Lions will land at grass fields near Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hospi­tal and Sengkang Gen­eral Hospi­tal, in a trib­ute to front-line fight­ers against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mil­i­tary Expert 2 (ME2) Muham­mad Khairun­nizam Am­ran’s decade-long in­volve­ment in Na­tional Day Pa­rades will be marked with a special one on Aug 9 that is be­ing held dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>De­spite smaller con­tin­gents, masks, safe dis­tanc­ing and shorter re­hearsal times, the 36-year-old said it will be es­pe­cially mean­ing­ful be­cause front-line work­ers, in­clud­ing nurses, will re­ceive a salute this year.</p>
    <p>His wife has been tak­ing care of Covid-19 pa­tients as a nurse at Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hospi­tal for the past few months, and will watch the pa­rade on tele­vi­sion at home with their two chil­dren, aged nine and six.</p>
    <p>“It is ex­tra special. I have seen her sac­ri­fice in her heavy in­volve­ment with Covid-19 ef­forts. This (NDP2020) lets me pay my com­pli­ments to her and show my ad­mi­ra­tion for her work,” said the prin­ci­pal sax­o­phon­ist with the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces (SAF) band.</p>
    <p>ME2 Khairun­nizam is one of about 200 con­tin­gent mem­bers from the SAF and the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force in­volved in the scaled­down cer­e­mo­nial pa­rade at the Padang.</p>
    <p>Usu­ally held in the evening to­gether with the more the­atri­cal dance and song as­pects, this year’s NDP will be held as two sep­a­rate seg­ments, with the pa­rade in the morn­ing fol­lowed by an evening show at The Star Per­form­ing Arts Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The first pa­rade re­hearsal that was ob­served by the me­dia took place yes­ter­day and sev­eral newly added fea­tures were show­cased in recog­ni­tion of the un­prece­dented times in which the show is tak­ing place.</p>
    <p>Apart from the special salute in ap­pre­ci­a­tion of front-line work­ers, the pres­i­den­tial gun salute will also be con­ducted at the Padang, for the first time.</p>
    <p>Another change – the rais­ing of the state flag at the Padang will be timed to co­in­cide with flag-rais­ing cer­e­monies across the coun­try to mark the event in the heart­land ar­eas.</p>
    <p>The NDP or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee said it hopes the “sim­ple but dig­ni­fied” pa­rade this year will al­low the coun­try to strike a de­fi­ant chord as Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to face down health and eco­nomic tra­vails.</p>
    <p>Pa­rade regimental sergeant ma­jor David Ling said the idea is to en­sure the pa­rade re­mains “solemn, dig­ni­fied, respectabl­e”.</p>
    <p>“In the be­gin­ning it was rather chal­leng­ing... But we went ahead to or­gan­ise this pa­rade to show­case Sin­ga­pore’s strength, unity and spirit,” the 43-year-old master war­rant of­fi­cer said.</p>
    <p>His role in main­tain­ing the pa­rade’s for­ma­tion this year will be es­pe­cially oner­ous as par­tic­i­pants are spaced far­ther apart.</p>
    <p>Un­like past years where they were about half a me­tre apart from one another, this gap will be dou­bled to pre­vent the spread of the coronaviru­s.</p>
    <p>Lieu­tenant-Colonel Ni­cholas Ong, the pa­rade com­man­der this year, said that com­pared with 38 march­ing con­tin­gents l ast year, NDP2020 will have only four as any more “will be too big for the Padang with safe dis­tanc­ing (mea­sures)”.</p>
    <p>He will be shout­ing pa­rade com­mands through a mask, which re­quires cos­metic tape to keep in place.</p>
    <p>On the un­usual ex­pe­ri­ence, the 38-year-old, who was se­lected for the role in April last year, said: “I tried on a few types of dif­fer­ent masks. This mask I ended up with is very light and doesn’t im­pede my shout­ing of com­mands.”</p>
    <p>On the im­por­tance of hav­ing the NDP in a year of crisis, he said: “We don’t just com­mem­o­rate the na­tion’s 55 years of in­de­pen­dence, but also show our re­spect to front­line fight­ers and un­sung he­roes, as well as Sin­ga­pore­ans who per­form es­sen­tial ser­vices.”</p>
