    <p>• Mr Brian Plum­mer was sit­ting to­wards the back of a Delta Air Lines flight ready­ing to de­part La­Guardia Air­port this week when, he said, he no­ticed a man and a woman with a large ser­vice dog nearby.</p>
    <p>The At­lanta-bound plane was not com­pletely full, Mr Plum­mer said, and the cou­ple changed seats sev­eral times on the Mon­day flight.</p>
    <p>The man and woman never did set­tle in, and as Flight 462 be­gan to taxi out to a run­way, the man stood up, ig­nor­ing a flight at­ten­dant’s or­der to sit, say­ing that he had posttrauma­tic stress dis­or­der, Mr Plum­mer said.</p>
    <p>A short time later, Mr Plum­mer said, he felt the plane shud­der to a stop. It was not im­me­di­ately clear to him why, but the flight crew even­tu­ally told the pas­sen­gers what had hap­pened.</p>
    <p>The man had forced open a cabin door, ac­ti­vat­ing an emer­gency slide, and then he, his fe­male com­pan­ion and their dog slid their way out of the plane, of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple are now in cus­tody. It is not clear what charges, if any, they might face, or whether they might be pro­hib­ited from fly­ing with Delta in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>This is not the first time a pan­icky pas­sen­ger has pulled such a ma­noeu­vre at a New York-area air­port, but nei­ther Delta, the Fed­eral Avi­a­tion Ad­min­is­tra­tion nor the Port Au­thor­ity of New York and New Jer­sey, which op­er­ates La­Guardia, could say on Mon­day just how un­usual it was for some­one to make such an es­cape.</p>
    <p>“This doesn’t hap­pen ev­ery day at the air­port,” said Ms Le­nis Valens, an au­thor­ity spokesman.</p>
    <p>The plane, which had been sched­uled to de­part shortly be­fore 10am, re­turned to the gate, where the re­main­ing pas­sen­gers “de­planed nor­mally and were ac­com­mo­dated on al­ter­nate flights”, a Delta spokesman said.</p>
    <p>No one was i njured i n the episode, the au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>The most fa­mous ex­am­ple of an unau­tho­rised slid­ing exit oc­curred 10 years ago at Kennedy In­ter­na­tional Air­port, with a Jet­Blue flight at­ten­dant who said he had been in­volved in a dis­pute with a pas­sen­ger.</p>
    <p>In that in­stance, af­ter an­nounc­ing his in­ten­tions over the plane’s pub­lic ad­dress sys­tem, the flight at­ten­dant ac­ti­vated an emer­gency slide, slid down to the tar­mac and threw his tie to the ground as he walked away.</p>
    <p>More re­cently, in Fe­bru­ary 2018, a trav­eller aboard a Florida-bound flight at Ne­wark Lib­erty In­ter­na­tional Air­port fled through an emer­gency exit and down an in­flat­able slide while the plane was still at the gate, ac­cord­ing to WNBC news net­work.</p>
