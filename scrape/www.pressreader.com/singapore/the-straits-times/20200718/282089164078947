    <p>A drug courier’s jail sen­tence was in­creased to life im­pris­on­ment fol­low­ing an ap­peal.</p>
    <p>The Court of Ap­peal also sen­tenced Aishamudin Ja­maludin, 35, to 15 strokes of the cane. This was stated in a judg­ment seen by The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In his ear­lier trial, he was sen­tenced to 25 years’ jail with the same num­ber of strokes.</p>
    <p>Aishamudin and his fel­low truck driver Suhaizam Khariri, 35, were em­ployed to de­liver goods from Malaysia to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>On Oct 6, 2015, Aishamudin asked Suhaizam to help him trans­port drugs to Sin­ga­pore and Suhaizam agreed.</p>
    <p>Aishamudin had ex­pected that they would re­ceive RM4,000 (S$1,300) for mak­ing this de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>The pair went to Bulim Av­enue near Jurong West Av­enue 2 af­ter 9pm that day, un­aware that Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bureau of­fi­cers were ob­serv­ing them.</p>
    <p>They were ar­rested soon af­ter. In Jan­uary 2018, Suhaizam pleaded guilty to de­liv­er­ing two pack­ets of a pow­dery sub­stance found to con­tain not l ess than 14.99g of di­amor­phine.</p>
    <p>He was sen­tenced to 25 years in jail, with 15 strokes of the cane.</p>
    <p>Aishamudin was charged with de­liv­er­ing two pack­ets of a sim­i­lar sub­stance con­tain­ing not l ess than 32.54g of di­amor­phine.</p>
    <p>He claimed trial and the judge later found it “log­i­cally un­sound” for the pros­e­cu­tion to charge the pair over dif­fer­ent amounts of the drug.</p>
    <p>The judge then amended Aishamudin’s charge to re­flect the amount stated in Suhaizam’s be­fore sen­tenc­ing Aishamudin to 25 years in jail, with 15 strokes of the cane.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tion ap­pealed this year against the trial judge’s de­ci­sion to amend Aishamudin’s orig­i­nal charge.</p>
    <p>De­liv­er­ing the Court of Ap­peal’s judg­ment, Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon said that Suhaizam’s charge and Aishamudin’s orig­i­nal charge were not in­con­sis­tent.</p>
    <p>CJ Menon added: “With re­spect, the judge erred in hold­ing that the lower amount of Suhaizam (14.99g) can­not pos­si­bly in­clude the larger amount of Aishamudin (32.54g).</p>
    <p>“Both Suhaizam’s charge and the orig­i­nal charge against Aishamudin are ca­pa­ble of con­sti­tut­ing part of a sin­gle co­her­ent world of facts, namely, one in which Suhaizam and Aishamudin both shared the com­mon in­ten­tion to traf­fic in 32.54g (or more) of di­amor­phine.”</p>
    <p>The Court of Ap­peal then al­lowed the pros­e­cu­tion’s ap­peal and con­victed Aishamudin of his orig­i­nal charge.</p>
