    <p>DBS Bank em­ploy­ees will be able to opt for job shar­ing as part of the lender’s ini­tia­tives aimed at trans­form­ing the way its staff work in a post-pan­demic world.</p>
    <p>Two em­ploy­ees will share the re­spon­si­bil­i­ties of one full-time role un­der the scheme, which builds on the bank’s abil­ity to op­er­ate suc­cess­fully in split teams over the past few months, said South-east Asia’s largest bank yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Staff un­der the scheme will re­tain all ex­ist­ing med­i­cal ben­e­fits in full and con­tinue to be cov­ered un­der the bank’s in­sur­ance plans.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the bank will in­tro­duce more part-time work ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that the job-shar­ing scheme is on a vol­un­tary ba­sis and is not a re­sult of cost-cut­ting mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Job shar­ing is a flexible work ar­range­ment where two or more peo­ple share the re­spon­si­bil­i­ties of one full-time job, ac­cord­ing to an im­ple­men­ta­tion guide about the scheme by the Min­istry of Man­power and the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The job may be di­vided by func­tion, ge­og­ra­phy, time or work­load, and the ar­range­ment re­quires a proper han­dover of du­ties.</p>
    <p>Job shar­ing dif­fers from parttime j obs, which are self-con­tained jobs with fewer than 35 hours of work per week.</p>
    <p>Only 1.3 per cent of com­pa­nies in Sin­ga­pore of­fered job-shar­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties as at June last year.</p>
    <p>The salaries of em­ploy­ees un­der the job-shar­ing schemes are ad­justed based on their new work ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Hu­man Re­sources In­sti­tute pres­i­dent Low Peck Kem said job shar­ing is not very com­mon here as it re­quires firms to man­age more em­ploy­ees and not many have reaped cost sav­ings as a re­sult of it.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she added, it can help firms re­tain ta­lent and en­hance pro­duc­tiv­ity, if used prop­erly.</p>
    <p>“The ben­e­fit for em­ploy­ees is clearly the choice to have flexible work ar­range­ments, suited to dif­fer­ent stages of an em­ployee’s life. Em­ploy­ees can mean­ing­fully con­trib­ute to the econ­omy as well as bal­ance other life in­ter­ests,” she said.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the scheme, DBS will give all em­ploy­ees the flex­i­bil­ity to work re­motely up to 40 per cent of their time at work. The bank will also create more “pro­ject-spe­cific, data-driven squads” – com­pared with the usual func­tional de­part­ments – which will be formed with mem­bers from var­i­ous func­tions and ar­eas of ex­per­tise.</p>
    <p>DBS has a 12,000-strong work­force in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>More than 7,200 em­ploy­ees across the bank – 4,300 of whom are in Sin­ga­pore – will also be up­skilled or reskilled in emerg­ing ar­eas such as de­sign think­ing and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>DBS chief Piyush Gupta said: “As the way we live, bank and work con­tin­ues to change dra­mat­i­cally, we must ad­dress the mag­ni­tude of the dis­rup­tions be­fore us. We are pre­pared to rad­i­cally transform the way we work by in­tro­duc­ing a com­pre­hen­sive range of mea­sures which in­clude (th­ese ini­tia­tives).”</p>
    <p>Like­wise, United Over­seas Bank said last Fri­day that the ma­jor­ity of its staff will be able to choose to work re­motely two days a week once Covid-19 re­stric­tions are lifted.</p>
    <p>In a six-month re­view of work ar­range­ments and tools, the bank found that about 65 per cent of its roles are suited to re­mote work­ing.</p>
    <p>UOB head of group hu­man re­sources Dean Tong said: “We be­lieve that the fu­ture of the work­place is a hy­brid one where em­ploy­ees choose how to man­age their work com­mit­ments based on the space and place they can be most ef­fec­tive.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, OCBC Bank head of group hu­man re­sources Ja­son Ho said: “Since the be­gin­ning of the pan­demic, we have been ag­ile in the way we in­tro­duced new ini­tia­tives, prac­tices and mea­sures to adapt and transform the way we work.”</p>
    <p>He added that the bank will con­tinue to do so as the sit­u­a­tion pro­gresses, tak­ing into ac­count fac­tors such as em­ploy­ees’ pref­er­ences and well-be­ing.</p>
