    <p>•</p>
    <p>The Premier League wants to change the hand­ball law and is in talks with rule-mak­ing body In­ter­na­tional Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion Board (Ifab) in a bid to end de­ci­sions such as the con­tro­ver­sial rul­ing against Tot­ten­ham’s Eric Dier.</p>
    <p>Fans can ex­pect to see a shift in ap­proach from ref­er­ees this week­end af­ter the Premier League’s ref­er­ees body, the Pro­fes­sional Game Match Of­fi­cials Lim­ited (PGMOL), opted to adopt a more le­nient ap­proach to the cur­rent laws.</p>
    <p>Ref­er­ees are now be­ing told they no longer have to view in­ci­dents through the prism of whether an arm or hand is in an “un­nat­u­ral po­si­tion” or out­side the body “sil­hou­ette”, as Ifab has urged.</p>
    <p>From this week­end, ref­er­ees can con­sider whether a player’s body is in the “ex­pected po­si­tion” for the ac­tion be­ing un­der­taken.</p>
    <p>The PGMOL be­lieves that ap­proach would mean cases like the hand­ball by Manch­ester United’s Vic­tor Lin­de­lof that led to Crys­tal</p>
    <p>Palace’s penalty would not be given, as his arm could be viewed as be­ing in the “ex­pected po­si­tion” for a play in a run­ning mo­tion.</p>
    <p>While the introducti­on of the con­cept of “ex­pected po­si­tion” may prompt sighs among fans tir­ing of the fre­quently chang­ing cri­te­ria for hand­ball, it should some­what ad­dress the harsh na­ture of re­cent de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>Ref­er­ees will also be en­cour­aged to con­sider fac­tors such as whether or not the player has a re­al­is­tic chance to get his arm out of the way of the ball.</p>
    <p>Cur­rent laws clearly state that a penalty or free kick must be given if a player’s hand or arm are “above shoul­der level”.</p>
    <p>Premier League ref­er­ee­ing of­fi­cials be­lieve they have no choice but to award such penal­ties given the word­ing of the law at the mo­ment and so are seek­ing so­lu­tions from Ifab. Any move to change the law would need to be put forth to Ifab be­fore Nov 1 to set in mo­tion a re­vi­sion for next sea­son.</p>
