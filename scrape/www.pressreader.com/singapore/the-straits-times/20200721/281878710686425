    <p>BEIJING • China hit back yes­ter­day at com­ments by Bri­tain’s For­eign Sec­re­tary that ac­cused Beijing of “gross” hu­man rights abuses against eth­nic and re­li­gious mi­nori­ties in the north-west re­gion of Xin­jiang.</p>
    <p>Rights groups and ex­perts es­ti­mate that over one mil­lion eth­nic Uighurs and other mostly Mus­lim mi­nori­ties have been rounded up into a net­work of i ntern­ment camps, which China says are fa­cil­i­ties for job train­ing and to steer peo­ple away from ex­trem­ism.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish For­eign Sec­re­tary Do­minic Raab told the BBC on Sun­day that it was “clear that there are gross, egre­gious hu­man rights abuses go­ing on... It is deeply, deeply trou­bling”.</p>
    <p>But Chi­nese for­eign min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin called the com­ments “noth­ing but rumours and slan­der”.</p>
    <p>“The Xin­jiang is­sue is not about hu­man rights, re­li­gions or eth­nic groups at all, but about com­bat­ing vi­o­lence, ter­ror­ism and sep­a­ratism,” he said yes­ter­day at a reg­u­lar press briefing.</p>
    <p>Mr Raab said re­ports of forced ster­il­i­sa­tions and mass de­ten­tions in Xin­jiang re­quired in­ter­na­tional at­ten­tion, and that Bri­tain “can­not see be­hav­iour like that and not call it out”.</p>
    <p>But Mr Wang said the forced ster­il­i­sa­tion re­ports were “com­plete non­sense”, and that the Uighur pop­u­la­tion had more than dou­bled in the past four decades.</p>
    <p>Ex­iled Uighurs this month called for the In­ter­na­tional Crim­i­nal Court in The Hague to in­ves­ti­gate China for geno­cide and crimes against hu­man­ity, fil­ing a huge dossier ac­cus­ing China of rights abuses, in­clud­ing forcibly ster­il­is­ing women.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions between Lon­don and Beijing have soared over a num­ber of top­ics. Bri­tain re­cently bowed to sus­tained pres­sure from the</p>
    <p>United States and or­dered the phased re­moval of Chi­nese tele­coms gi­ant Huawei from its 5G net­work, de­spite warn­ings of re­tal­i­a­tion from Beijing.</p>
    <p>The two sides have also clashed over China’s im­po­si­tion of a con­tro­ver­sial na­tional se­cu­rity law in Hong Kong – in­clud­ing of­fer­ing a pos­si­ble route to Bri­tish ci­ti­zen­ship for some Hong Kong res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s Supreme Court pres­i­dent sug­gested last week that the two Bri­tish judges who still serve in Hong Kong’s Court of Fi­nal Ap­peal – un­der the terms of the ter­ri­tory’s han­dover agree­ment with China in 1997 – could stand down un­less the rule of law was guar­an­teed in the semi-au­ton­o­mous city.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang said yes­ter­day that Beijing would “op­pose in­ter­fer­ence in Hong Kong af­fairs by out­side forces” and that ju­di­cial in­de­pen­dence was not af­fected by the new se­cu­rity law.</p>
