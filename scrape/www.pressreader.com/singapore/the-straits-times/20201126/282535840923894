    <p>Wong Liang Ming, the for­mer Sin­ga­pore Taekwondo Fed­er­a­tion (STF) sec­re­tary-gen­eral who filed a defama­tion suit against the na­tional body, has agreed to an of­fer of an at­tempt at me­di­a­tion but is “dis­ap­pointed” a set­tle­ment of­fer was not tabled by the or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The le­gal tus­sle be­tween Wong and the STF arose from a sus­pen­sion handed down on her by global gov­ern­ing body World Taekwondo (WT) in Jan­uary, which the STF later an­nounced on its web­site in May.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing a pre-trial con­fer­ence on Nov 11, STF’s le­gal con­sul­tant Steven Lam of Tem­plars Law pro­posed in a Nov 18 let­ter that the mat­ter be re­ferred to me­di­a­tion un­der the Al­ter­na­tive Dis­pute Res­o­lu­tion for Sports Frame­work or at the Sin­ga­pore Me­di­a­tion Cen­tre, “or at any other me­di­a­tion in­sti­tu­tion (Wong) may pro­pose”.</p>
    <p>He noted that the STF had pre­vi­ously pro­posed me­di­a­tion, but did not re­ceive a “favourable re­sponse” from Wong.</p>
    <p>“In view of the var­i­ous stake­hold­ers in­volved in the present dis­pute (in­clud­ing WT and the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Olympic Coun­cil), our client is of the view that me­di­a­tion would be the most ef­fec­tive and ef­fi­cient way of fa­cil­i­tat­ing dis­cus­sions be­tween par­ties, with the view to reach­ing an am­i­ca­ble set­tle­ment of the mat­ter (as op­posed to ex­changes via cor­re­spon­dence through par­ties’ so­lic­i­tors),” said Lam in the let­ter.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Wong’s l awyer Clarence Lun of Fox­wood LLC yes­ter­day stated in the re­ply that she is “pre­pared to at­tend a with­out­prej­u­dice meet­ing” with the STF, and would have no ob­jec­tion if the as­so­ci­a­tion wishes to ap­point an in­de­pen­dent me­di­a­tor.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he also added in the let­ter that “me­di­a­tion does not con­sti­tute as equally ef­fec­tive and con­ve­nient a rem­edy as the av­enue of ju­di­cial re­view in re­spect of our client’s ap­pli­ca­tion”. Wong is seek­ing dam­ages up­wards of $250,000, in­clud­ing ag­gra­vated dam­ages and costs to be as­sessed.</p>
    <p>Lun told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that the STF had in­formed the court dur­ing the pre-trial con­fer­ence that they would “fur­nish a pro­posal for the set­tle­ment” by Nov 18, and added: “Our client, Ms Wong is dis­ap­pointed that there are no ‘concrete of­fers’ save for an of­fer to me­di­ate.</p>
    <p>“Be that as it may, our client is amenable to meet the de­fen­dant for a with­out-prej­u­dice dis­cus­sion and to lis­ten to of­fers.”</p>
    <p>Lun also said Wong has filed an ap­peal to the Court of Ap­peal in a bid to over­turn the Oct 27 de­ci­sion by High Court judge Au­drey Lim to dis­miss her ap­pli­ca­tion for leave for ju­di­cial re­view, and ap­ply for a quash­ing or­der against the STF’s de­ci­sion to en­force WT’s sus­pen­sion. Wong had made the ap­pli­ca­tion in June.</p>
    <p>The le­gal tus­sle be­tween Wong and the STF fol­lows a se­ries of in­ci­dents in­volv­ing the na­tional taekwondo body and WT.</p>
    <p>These be­gan with WT and the SNOC sus­pend­ing the STF in May last year af­ter the na­tional as­so­ci­a­tion was charged with vi­o­lat­ing the world body’s rules on good gover­nance and a fail­ure to re­ceive recog­ni­tion from the ap­pro­pri­ate na­tional Olympic com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust last year, WT in­formed Wong of its charge against her for vi­o­lat­ing two ar­ti­cles of its ethics code and a pre­lim­i­nary sus­pen­sion, pend­ing de­ter­mi­na­tion by a tri­bunal. How­ever, she sent le­gal let­ters to the STF and WT in­form­ing the lat­ter that she would “cease to par­tic­i­pate” in the Seoul-based world body’s hear­ings as it had re­jected her re­quest for a three-man tri­bunal, in­stead de­cid­ing on a one-man tri­bunal.</p>
    <p>The global body in Jan­uary then stated that she had been banned for “grave mis­con­duct” and barred her from taekwondo-re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties world­wide, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore. STF later an­nounced the sus­pen­sion on its web­site in May. Nei­ther the STF nor WT stated the length of the sus­pen­sion.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, STF an­nounced a clar­i­fi­ca­tion on Wong’s sta­tus, stat­ing that she was not al­lowed to par­tic­i­pate only in “taekwondo ac­tiv­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore which are co­or­di­nated and/or sanc­tioned and/or or­gan­ised in Sin­ga­pore (in­clud­ing na­tional and in­ter­na­tional taekwondo tour­na­ments, demon­stra­tions and grad­ings) by STF” as well as “taekwondo ac­tiv­i­ties sanc­tioned and/or pro­moted by WT world­wide”.</p>
    <p>Wong, how­ever, felt that the clar­i­fi­ca­tion did not “rec­tify or clar­ify the amend­ments” and filed a defama­tion suit on Sept 18.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, the STF filed a coun­ter­claim of defama­tion, over state­ments the four-time SEA Games cham­pion made in a Face­book post on Sept 23.</p>
