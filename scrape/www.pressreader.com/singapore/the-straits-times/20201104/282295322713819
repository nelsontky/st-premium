    <p>There are about 30,000 Sin­ga­porean low-wage work­ers, and the high­est ed­u­ca­tional qual­i­fi­ca­tion for four in five of them is post-se­condary level or lower, said Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Man­power Zaqy Mo­hamad.</p>
    <p>For about half of these work­ers – largely em­ployed in roles such as those of of­fice clerks, food and bev­er­age work­ers, clean­ers and shop sales­men – the high­est level is se­condary ed­u­ca­tion or lower, he said.</p>
    <p>More than one-third of the 30,000 low-wage Sin­ga­porean work­ers are aged 50 and above, and this re­flects a pro­file of work­ers who have less ac­cess to higher ed­u­ca­tion and could be at higher risk of be­ing un­em­ployed, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Zaqy was re­spond­ing in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day to a ques­tion from Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Pan­jang), who asked for the pro­files of work­ers who earn not more than $1,300 monthly.</p>
    <p>One-third of this group of work­ers are youth aged be­tween 15 and 24 who are in “va­ca­tion jobs”, Mr Zaqy said.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, he said that there are about 30,000 full-time em­ploy­ees and 22,000 self-em­ployed in­di­vid­u­als who re­ceive less than $1,300 a month, in re­sponse to a ques­tion filed by As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ja­mus Lim (Sengkang GRC).</p>
    <p>Mr Zaqy said that about half of the 30,000 Sin­ga­pore­ans live in house­holds with a house­hold per capita in­come of more than $1,300, which sug­gests they are not the pri­mary bread­win­ners for their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>As for what is be­ing done to help this group of work­ers, Mr Zaqy said that be­sides re­ceiv­ing Work­fare In­come Sup­ple­ment (WIS) pay­outs, they will con­tinue to be sup­ported by the Work­fare Skills Sup­port Scheme.</p>
    <p>This en­ables them to up­skill and earn higher wages, he said, adding that other schemes are also avail­able for their daily and med­i­cal needs.</p>
    <p>Prof Lim had asked for the num­ber of Sin­ga­pore­ans earn­ing not more than $1,300 a month in take­home pay, ex­clud­ing em­ployer and em­ployee Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) con­tri­bu­tions, as well as other de­duc­tions of in­come.</p>
    <p>Mr Zaqy said the In­ter­na­tional Labour Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s (ILO) def­i­ni­tion of earn­ings in­cludes con­tri­bu­tions of em­ploy­ees to so­cial se­cu­rity and pen­sion schemes.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s ap­proach is broadly aligned with the ILO’s, and con­sid­ers per­sonal in­come to in­clude CPF con­tri­bu­tions and WIS pay­outs be­cause these can be used for ne­ces­si­ties, in­clud­ing healthcare and hous­ing, he said.</p>
    <p>He said the WIS re­mains a key pil­lar of so­cial se­cu­rity for Sin­ga­porean lower-wage work­ers, with stud­ies con­sis­tently showing that it has been ef­fec­tive in mo­ti­vat­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans with lower ed­u­ca­tion lev­els to en­ter and stay in the work­force.</p>
    <p>In the past three years, an av­er­age of about 400,000 peo­ple a year have re­ceived WIS pay­outs, said Mr Zaqy. The av­er­age pay­out re­ceived an­nu­ally in the same pe­riod was about $1,560, while the max­i­mum was $3,600.</p>
    <p>About half, or 49 per cent, of all WIS re­cip­i­ents are aged 60 and above.</p>
    <p>In a fol­low-up ques­tion, Ms Car­rie Tan (Nee Soon GRC) asked if the age cri­te­rion to qual­ify for WIS – set at a min­i­mum age of 35 – would be re­vised if the worker is the sole bread­win­ner in his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Mr Zaqy said he un­der­stood Ms Tan’s con­cerns, but sug­gested that WIS is tar­geted at older work­ers, with about half of the re­cip­i­ents aged 60 and above.</p>
    <p>For those who are sin­gle par­ents or have other fam­ily is­sues, Mr Zaqy said other gov­ern­ment schemes are avail­able, in­clud­ing ComCare or fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance schemes in schools.</p>
