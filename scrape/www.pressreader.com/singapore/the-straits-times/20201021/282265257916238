    <p>SHANG­HAI • China is mint­ing new bil­lion­aires at a record pace de­spite an econ­omy bruised by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, thanks to boom­ing share prices and a spate of new stock list­ings, ac­cord­ing to a list re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Hu­run China Rich List 2020 also high­lights China’s ac­cel­er­ated shift away from tra­di­tional sec­tors like man­u­fac­tur­ing and real es­tate, to­wards ecom­merce, fi­nan­cial tech­nol­ogy and other new econ­omy in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>Mr Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba, topped the list once again, with his per­sonal wealth jump­ing 45 per cent to US$58.8 bil­lion (S$80 bil­lion) partly due to the im­pend­ing mega list­ing of fin­tech gi­ant Ant Group.</p>
    <p>Ant is ex­pected to cre­ate more mega rich peo­ple through what is likely to be the world’s big­gest ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO), as it plans to raise an es­ti­mated US$35 bil­lion through a dual list­ing in Shang­hai and Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The com­bined wealth of those on the Hu­run China list – with an in­di­vid­ual wealth cut-off of two bil­lion yuan (S$406 mil­lion) – to­talled US$4 tril­lion, more than the an­nual gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) of Ger­many, ac­cord­ing to Hu­run Re­port chair­man Ru­pert Hoogew­erf.</p>
    <p>More wealth was cre­ated this year than in the pre­vi­ous five years com­bined, with China’s rich-lis­ters adding US$1.5 tril­lion, roughly half the size of Bri­tain’s GDP.</p>
    <p>Boom­ing stock mar­kets and a flurry of new list­ings have cre­ated five new dol­lar bil­lion­aires in China a week for the past year, Mr Hoogew­erf said in a state­ment. “The world has never seen this much wealth cre­ated in just one year. China’s en­trepreneur­s have done much bet­ter than ex­pected. De­spite Covid-19, they have risen to record lev­els.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a sep­a­rate es­ti­mate by PwC and UBS, only bil­lion­aires in the United States pos­sessed greater com­bined wealth than those in main­land China.</p>
    <p>China has ac­cel­er­ated cap­i­tal mar­ket re­forms to aid a virus-hit econ­omy, speed up eco­nomic re­struc­tur­ing and fund a “tech war” with the US.</p>
    <p>To ex­pe­dite IPOs, reg­u­la­tors launched a US-style IPO sys­tem on Shang­hai’s Nas­daq-style Star Mar­ket and Shen­zhen’s ChiNext. Chi­nese cor­po­rate list­ings in Hong Kong and Nas­daq have also turbo-charged the for­tunes of com­pany founders.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhong Shan­shan, who re­cently listed his bot­tled wa­ter maker Nongfu Spring in Hong Kong, shot straight into the top three with US$53.7 bil­lion, trail­ing Ten­cent founder Pony Ma at US$57.4 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The wealth of Mr He Xiaopeng surged 80 per cent to US$6.6 bil­lion af­ter the list­ing of his elec­tric ve­hi­cle maker Xpeng Mo­tors in New York dur­ing the sum­mer.</p>
