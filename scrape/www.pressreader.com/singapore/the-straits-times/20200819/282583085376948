    <p>TOKYO • J-pop stars To­mo­hisa Ya­mashita (left) and Kazuya Ka­me­nashi have been dis­ci­plined by their agency after they were spot­ted drink­ing with two un­der­age girls.</p>
    <p>Johnny & As­so­ciates an­nounced on Mon­day that Ya­mashita, 35, has been sus­pended from show-busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties for an un­spec­i­fied pe­riod of time, while Ka­me­nashi, 34, was given a stern warn­ing and re­quired to write a let­ter to re­flect on his ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Ja­panese news­pa­per Mainichi Shim­bun, the agency felt the pair’s ac­tions dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic “lacked aware­ness and re­spon­si­bil­ity”.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese magazine Shukan Bun­shun re­ported on Aug 7 that Ya­mashita, who re­cently acted in the thriller se­ries The Head, and Ka­me­nashi, a mem­ber of boy band Kat-tun, went drink­ing at a bar in Tokyo on July 30. The magazine said there were sev­eral other peo­ple at the bar with the two girls – aged 17 and 18.</p>
    <p>The le­gal drink­ing age in Ja­pan is 20.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to the re­ports, Johnny & As­so­ciates ad­mit­ted in a state­ment that both Ya­mashita and Ka­me­nashi were drink­ing with un­der­age girls at the time. It said the artists were not aware of the real ages of the girls, as they were in­tro­duced to them by other friends at the bar.</p>
    <p>The agency did not re­act to Shukan Bun­shun’s report that Ya­mashita was seen at the same ho­tel with the 17-year-old after the drink­ing ses­sion.</p>
