    <p>We re­fer to Ms Luah Jiun Yih’s let­ter (Par­ents should be told as soon as chil­dren fall ill in pre-schools, Dec 12).</p>
    <p>The health and well-be­ing of chil­dren and staff in pre-schools are of ut­most im­por­tance to the Early Child­hood De­vel­op­ment Agency (ECDA).</p>
    <p>To pre­vent and con­trol the spread of in­fec­tious dis­eases among chil­dren and staff, all pre-schools must ad­here to the in­fec­tion con­trol guide­lines is­sued by the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>This in­cludes en­sur­ing high lev­els of per­sonal, en­vi­ron­men­tal and food hy­giene prac­tices, and mon­i­tor­ing chil­dren and staff closely for symp­toms of com­mon in­fec­tious dis­eases.</p>
    <p>We agree with Ms Luah that it is im­por­tant for par­ents to be promptly in­formed when there are cases of in­fec­tious dis­eases in a pre-school. This en­ables par­ents to mon­i­tor their chil­dren for symp­toms and seek med­i­cal at­ten­tion, where nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>There­fore, pre-schools are re­quired to in­form par­ents and ECDA promptly when they are aware of any clin­i­cally sus­pected or known case of in­fec­tious dis­ease, such as chicken pox or gas­troen­teri­tis, among chil­dren and/or staff.</p>
    <p>Pre-schools are also re­quired to no­tify MOH if clus­ters of gas­troen­teri­tis, hand, foot and mouth dis­ease and res­pi­ra­tory ill­nesses emerge.</p>
    <p>In such in­stances, ECDA will work to­gether with MOH and other rel­e­vant agen­cies to in­ves­ti­gate the case and pro­vide guid­ance to the pre-school on mea­sures to be taken to min­imise the spread of in­fec­tion within the pre-school and pre­vent a sim­i­lar out­break in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Should there be lapses by the pre-school that com­pro­mise the health and well-be­ing of chil­dren and staff, ECDA will not he­si­tate to take stern ac­tion against the pre-school.</p>
