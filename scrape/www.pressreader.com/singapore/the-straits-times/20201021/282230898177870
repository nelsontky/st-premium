    <p>Thai­land’s econ­omy faces se­vere shocks from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and a re­cov­ery is ex­pected to take at least two years to get back to pre-pan­demic lev­els, the coun­try’s new cen­tral bank gover­nor said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>South-east Asia’s sec­ond-largest econ­omy, which is heav­ily re­liant on trade and tourism, could shrink a record 7.8 per cent this year, the Bank of Thai­land (BOT) pre­dicted.</p>
    <p>Eco­nomic prob­lems can be solved but it will take time as there are “no magic bul­lets”, Mr Setha­put Suthi­wart­narueput said.</p>
    <p>“The shocks are very se­vere, most no­tably on tourism,” he said, adding that the sec­tor could lose 1.6 tril­lion baht (S$69.4 bil­lion), or 10 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, with for­eign ar­rivals ex­pected at 6.7 mil­lion this year, against nearly 40 mil­lion last year.</p>
    <p>But the coun­try has a strong ex­ter­nal po­si­tion to with­stand any shocks, said Mr Setha­put.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy, which suf­fered its worst con­trac­tion in 22 years in the June quar­ter, is ex­pected to post some growth in the sec­ond quar­ter of next year, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Setha­put said the BOT would en­sure mon­e­tary pol­icy and liq­uid­ity would not hin­der the re­cov­ery. “Our pol­icy rate is the low­est in this re­gion and a record low with lim­ited room, so other mea­sures... will have to play a ma­jor role,” he said.</p>
    <p>The BOT has cut the key rate three times this year to an all-time low of 0.5 per cent to sup­port the econ­omy. It will next re­view pol­icy on Nov 18.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral bank would con­sider more mea­sures as ap­pro­pri­ate but was in no rush to in­tro­duce them.</p>
    <p>It would also en­cour­age cap­i­tal out­flows to help ease the baht strength, Mr Setha­put said.</p>
    <p>The BOT would also mon­i­tor grow­ing street protests which could af­fect con­fi­dence, con­sump­tion and tourism, he added.</p>
