    <p>Stephen Curry is a three-time Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) cham­pion and a two-time Most Valu­able Player.</p>
    <p>He should never be un­der­es­ti­mated even when the go­ing gets tough, ac­cord­ing to Steve Kerr.</p>
    <p>The Golden State War­riors coach was proven right when the guard scored 38 points and the War­riors used a 34-6 flurry bridg­ing the third and fourth quar­ters to stun the vis­it­ing Los An­ge­les Clip­pers 115-105 on Fri­day night in San Fran­cisco.</p>
    <p>“It’s just who Steph is,” Kerr said. “He’s been do­ing this for many, many years and it’s one of the rea­sons he’s a two- time MVP.</p>
    <p>“Usu­ally with Steph, when he has a tough game he bounces back with the next one.”</p>
    <p>In the re­match of the Clip­pers’ 108-101 win on Wed­nes­day night, the War­riors (5-4) used 20 three­p­oint­ers – in­clud­ing nine by Curry – to pre­vent a two-game sweep.</p>
    <p>Curry was held to just 13 points dur­ing Wed­nes­day’s loss.</p>
    <p>His nine three-point­ers on Fri­day were the most by a War­riors player this sea­son, and he added 11 as­sists.</p>
    <p>Paul Ge­orge had a team-high 25 points and Kawhi Leonard 24 for Los An­ge­les (6-4), who had won their first three games at the Chase Cen­tre, in­clud­ing a pair of blowouts last sea­son.</p>
    <p>The War­riors trailed by 14 at half­time and 85-63 late in the third pe­riod be­fore a three-pointer by Curry at the 3min 4sec mark of the quar­ter turned the tide.</p>
    <p>He capped a 19-point quar­ter with a 29-footer in the fi­nal sec­onds to get Golden State within 87-81.</p>
    <p>When Damion Lee, Eric Paschall and Kent Baze­more added threes of their own early in the fourth pe­riod, sud­denly Golden State had taken a 97-91 lead.</p>
    <p>Los An­ge­les never led again but did forge a 97-all tie on back-to­back three-point­ers by Luke Ken­nard and Serge Ibaka, the lat­ter with 7:09 to play.</p>
    <p>But Brad Wana­maker coun­tered with a pair of three-point­ers for the War­riors and An­drew Wig­gins hit a key hoop af­ter the Clip­pers had come to within a point one last time, send­ing Golden State to their third win in their last four games.</p>
    <p>Curry hit 13 of his 24 shots and nine of his 14 three-point at­tempts in the third 30-point ef­fort in his last four games.</p>
    <p>“We are a young team try­ing to find our iden­tity and un­der­stand how we are go­ing to win games,” he said.</p>
    <p>“A win like this gives us con­fi­dence that no mat­ter how far out of it we are, we can turn it around.”</p>
    <p>Else­where, Jerami Grant tied his ca­reer high with 31 points as the hosts Detroit Pis­tons (2-7) ral­lied from a 23-point, first-half deficit to down the Phoenix Suns (6-3) 110-105 in over­time.</p>
    <p>Grant, who also snared 10 re­bounds, had just es­tab­lished a new ca­reer high in points against Mil­wau­kee on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Devin Booker led the Suns with 23 points and for­mer Pis­ton Langston Gal­loway had 17.</p>
    <p>In Mil­wau­kee, Dono­van Mitchell scored 32 points and Jordan Clark­son added 26 to lead vis­it­ing Utah (5-4) to a 131-118 vic­tory over the Bucks (5-4).</p>
    <p>The Jazz snapped a two-game los­ing streak af­ter mak­ing a fran­chise-record 25 three-point­ers.</p>
    <p>Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo scored 35 points and Khris Mid­dle­ton added 31 to lead Mil­wau­kee.</p>
    <p>The duo also com­bined for 18 re­bounds and eight as­sists. But it was not enough to keep the Bucks from los­ing at home for the first time this sea­son.</p>
