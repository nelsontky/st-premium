    <p>As the pan­demic rolls on un­abated, one group that’s most af­fected world­wide are stu­dents, es­pe­cially those in ter­tiary ed­u­ca­tion for whom book work and lec­tures are only part of the learn­ing. So much of the rest of their ed­u­ca­tion de­pends on group dis­cus­sions, on­site work ex­pe­ri­ence and other ac­tiv­i­ties that need them to work closely with oth­ers, a po­ten­tial health haz­ard now.</p>
    <p>If you were Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity, the last bits are par­tic­u­larly im­por­tant. Covid-19 has up­ended so much.</p>
    <p>Yet, a con­ver­sa­tion with SMU pres­i­dent Lily Kong – the first Sin­ga­porean woman to lead a lo­cal univer­sity – re­veals any­thing but a de­featist at­ti­tude. In fact, she says, Covid-19 has helped af­firm that the three ar­eas of fo­cus that SMU had set it­self – dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion, sus­tain­able liv­ing and growth in Asia – were in­deed the right pri­or­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple say to me, all this must have been slowed down, but the re­verse has hap­pened,” says</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Kong. “It has given us a sense of ur­gency and re­as­sur­ance that the ar­eas we had picked were ab­so­lutely rel­e­vant.”</p>
    <p>Twenty years into its ex­is­tence – the last two of which she has led it as pres­i­dent – SMU, lo­cated in the Bras Basah area, has de­vel­oped some­thing of a unique char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>Where older grooves of academe brood on in the leafy am­bi­ence of Kent Ridge and Jurong, SMU sits in the heart of the city, close to the in­sti­tu­tions that its alumni, or “prod­ucts”, will head to with their new de­grees.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude banks like DBS Group, the courts and law firms such as Den­tons Rodyk, con­sumer goods gi­ants like Unilever, and govern­ment agen­cies and statu­tory boards such as the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board.</p>
    <p>For all the stresses that Covid-19 has placed on busi­nesses, in­clud­ing jobs and fresh hir­ing, SMU’s place­ment track­ing sug­gests that eight out of 10 of the most re­cent co­hort found em­ploy­ment this year against more than 90 per cent of the out­flow when mea­sured in Novem­ber, typ­i­cally.</p>
    <p>Young lawyers are get­ting their train­ing con­tracts as be­fore and those emerg­ing from the in­for­ma­tion sys­tems and dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion streams are par­tic­u­larly in de­mand.</p>
    <p>It is a huge re­lief for univer­sity ad­min­is­tra­tors be­cause it af­firms that they are send­ing into jobs young women and men fit for pur­pose. Ul­ti­mately, this will feed back into stu­dent in­ter­est in join­ing the univer­sity.</p>
    <p>The place­ment fig­ures will likely im­prove by the year end, says Prof Kong, since the 80 per cent fig­ure re­lates to data up to July.</p>
    <p>“I told Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung just after he moved from ed­u­ca­tion to trans­port that I had good news – things are much bet­ter than what we had hoped for.”</p>
    <p>In­ter­est­ingly, SMU has had a bumper har­vest of fresh­ers this year, ad­mit­ting no fewer than 2,400 stu­dents. That com­pares with an in­com­ing co­hort of about 2,100 in the two years prior, and even fewer in the years be­fore.</p>
    <p>“Lots of stu­dents are stay­ing back in Sin­ga­pore this year,” says Prof Kong. “We would like to ex­pand en­rol­ments, but the birth co­hort be­ing what it is in Sin­ga­pore, the un­der­grad­u­ate in­take will start to come down. While the larger di­rec­tions are set by the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion, we are of the view that we should not go back to 1,700 be­cause there is such a thing as crit­i­cal mass which makes for a com­mu­nity of stu­dents who can mix with stu­dents from other dis­ci­plinary back­grounds.”</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional stu­dents, for in­stance, are limited to 10 per cent of the in­take. Given the in­ter­est in the univer­sity from around the re­gion, SMU be­lieves it can ac­cept dozens more full-pay­ing for­eign stu­dents with­out sac­ri­fic­ing places for lo­cals.</p>
    <p>What makes a typ­i­cal SMU stu­dent? Prof Kong says her stu­dents are dis­tin­guish­able by their ar­tic­u­late­ness, self-con­fi­dence in of­fer­ing a view, and work-readi­ness. She at­tributes this largely to the in­ter­ac­tive learn­ing ped­a­gogy as well as strong in­dus­try en­gage­ment and ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>In­tern­ships are a grad­u­a­tion re­quire­ment and a typ­i­cal stu­dent does 2.6 in­tern­ships, whether at com­pa­nies, govern­ment de­part­ments or even non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Good as SMU stu­dents doubt­less are, there is, of course, the per­cep­tion that Sin­ga­pore­ans tend to be too for­mu­laic and process driven in their ap­proach, lim­it­ing their abil­ity to think out of the box. I ask if SMU had an an­ti­dote.</p>
    <p>“It is work in progress. If we did (have a so­lu­tion), we would fran­chise it,” says Prof Kong. “What we do try – and I do it in my re­search as well – is to ex­pose my­self to ar­eas that are not in my im­me­di­ate fo­cus. It is al­ways the tan­gen­tial things I am do­ing that give me per­spec­tive on a topic. My dean takes this view to our cur­ricu­lum that if you are too fo­cused on some­thing, it means you are un­fo­cused on other things.</p>
    <p>“From the start, we had a cur­ricu­lum that ex­poses stu­dents to other fields. For in­stance, the fact that SMU stu­dents have to work on sus­tain­abil­ity and cli­mate change could ul­ti­mately push you to­wards a ca­reer in green fi­nance.”</p>
    <p>What about the vast changes sweep­ing the tech­no­log­i­cal and in­dus­trial land­scape, such as au­to­ma­tion, ro­bot­ics, ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and the In­ter­net of Things? All this when so­ci­ety’s pref­er­ences are it­self chang­ing in myr­iad ways?</p>
    <p>Prof Kong says SMU views man­age­ment with a far more ex­pan­sive lens than busi­ness man­age­ment. Both she and pre­de­ces­sor-pres­i­dent Arnoud de Meyer are con­vinced that man­age­ment in­volves also how so­ci­ety and the en­vi­ron­ment are best or­gan­ised and dealt with. This lends a prac­ti­cal edge to what is taught at SMU.</p>
    <p>As for spe­cific ar­eas, dis­cus­sions are on­go­ing on set­ting up cen­tres for ma­chine learn­ing and econo­met­rics, ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and law. SMU’s Cen­tre for Com­pu­ta­tional Law is writ­ing code and look­ing at how to de­velop tools for the lawyer of the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>At the other end, the univer­sity is analysing what new is­sues lawyers will con­front and how gov­er­nance and reg­u­la­tory frame­works can be set to deal with th­ese new is­sues.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, it in­tro­duced a de­gree in com­put­ing and law, the first of its kind in Sin­ga­pore. Mean­while, its Re­tail Cen­tre for Ex­cel­lence is look­ing at how data an­a­lyt­ics can deepen un­der­stand­ing of changes in that in­dus­try. Then, there is lo­gis­tics and op­er­a­tions man­age­ment, an­other area see­ing swift change.</p>
    <p>“We are look­ing for part­ners and for grants that would sup­port re­search in this di­rec­tion,” she says, not­ing that Carnegie Mel­lon Univer­sity has been a good univer­sity part­ner for some years and SMU has just fur­thered a re­la­tion­ship with Im­pe­rial Col­lege Lon­don in green fi­nance.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, SMU part­ners Fu­jitsu and the Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion in Uni­cen, a lab that works on re­search and de­vel­op­ment com­bin­ing com­put­ing, be­havioural eco­nomics and man­age­ment sci­ence ap­proaches to cre­ate in­tel­li­gent sys­tems that ad­dress lo­cal ur­ban chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>I can­not help won­der­ing what she, a noted ge­og­ra­pher, is do­ing run­ning a “man­age­ment” univer­sity.</p>
    <p>It is not an un­fa­mil­iar ques­tion and Prof Kong’s first re­sponse is that there is noth­ing that stops some­one from out­side Stem (sci­ence, tech­nol­ogy, en­gi­neer­ing and math­e­mat­ics) lead­ing a univer­sity. Be­sides, she says, SMU takes a broad view of “man­age­ment”.</p>
    <p>“The abil­ity to think broadly is not the purview of any one dis­ci­pline,” she says. “As a ge­og­ra­pher, I have par­tic­u­lar skills that geography has de­vel­oped in me that make for a very good man­ager and leader. You will see geog­ra­phers lead­ing many uni­ver­si­ties be­cause the na­ture of the dis­ci­pline is a syn­the­sis­ing one.”</p>
    <p>Prof Kong’s move from NUS to SMU, first as provost, then the el­e­va­tion to pres­i­dent, in some ways marks a re­turn to fa­mil­iar sur­round­ings. In fact, her large of­fice in the SMU build­ing looks out on the class­room in her for­mer school, CHIJ.</p>
    <p>Not born into priv­i­lege – her mother worked in a va­ri­ety of jobs, in­clud­ing as babysit­ter to put her three girls and a son through school – Prof Kong says she has more than one North Star in life. Her mother, who was di­ag­nosed with can­cer when Prof Kong was 18, was, of course, the first. But there were oth­ers too, in­clud­ing a re­lief teacher at CHIJ who got her hus­band to stand as guar­an­tor for her univer­sity schol­ar­ship al­though she had known Prof</p>
    <p>Kong for just three months.</p>
    <p>Ex­pe­ri­ences such as th­ese no doubt shape her view of the world, what uni­ver­si­ties should rep­re­sent and what their prod­ucts ought to be like. Columbia Univer­sity, next to Har­lem, is not known to work too closely with the lo­cal com­mu­nity, she notes. On the other hand, New York Univer­sity, sited in Green­wich Vil­lage, is not only mind­ful of the city it is in but also reaches out to other city lo­ca­tions in Shang­hai and Abu Dhabi. SMU would have earned its place if one day its lease on the cur­rent lo­ca­tions run out and the lo­cal peo­ple, com­pa­nies and govern­ment of­fices in the neigh­bour­hood rise up to de­mand the univer­sity stays where it is.</p>
    <p>Prof Kong has been a mem­ber of the Public Ser­vice Com­mis­sion for more than a decade. I ask about the qual­ity of can­di­dates she sees as part of her work there and what she seeks in them.</p>
    <p>“The will­ing­ness to give a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of their years with the right heart,” she re­sponds.</p>
