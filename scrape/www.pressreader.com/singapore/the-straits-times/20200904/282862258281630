    <p>ARI­ZONA (UNITED STATES) • Dare­devil David Blaine per­formed his lat­est stunt on Wed­nes­day, as­cend­ing nearly 7,600m into the Ari­zona sky while hang­ing from a clus­ter of jumbo-sized bal­loons be­fore parachut­ing safely back to earth.</p>
    <p>“It’s like magic, it feels like I’m float­ing in the air,” Blaine, while con­nected to dozens of bal­loons in an event he called As­cen­sion, said in a ra­dio mes­sage to his team of aides back on the ground, af­ter gen­tly lift­ing off from a desert airstrip in Page, Ari­zona.</p>
    <p>YouTube said the live-streamed stunt set a new record as the most-watched YouTube Orig­i­nals live event with more than 770,000 view­ers.</p>
    <p>Blaine, 47, grad­u­ally dropped small weights to speed his ascent, donned a para­chute mid-flight and strapped on an oxy­gen mask as he neared 7,600m. Most com­mer­cial flights travel at a height of around 9,500m.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, he post­poned the stunt and an­nounced he was mov­ing it from its ini­tial lo­ca­tion of New Jer­sey and New York to Ari­zona “be­cause of the com­plex­ity of (the) project”.</p>
    <p>Blaine has a his­tory of per­form­ing high-pro­file, high-risk feats of en­durance. These in­clude lock­ing him­self in a fish bowl, trap­ping him­self in a block of ice for two days in Times Square, and stand­ing freely atop a tall, thin pil­lar for 35 hours in New York City.</p>
    <p>Wed­nes­day’s stunt lasted roughly 30 min­utes. Blaine re­leased him­self from the bal­loon clus­ter and free-fell for some 30 se­conds be­fore de­ploy­ing a para­chute to slow his de­scent.</p>
    <p>“Wow, that was awe­some,” he yelled into his ra­dio as he stood back on land.</p>
    <p>Blaine said he trained for the event for two years, in­clud­ing be­com­ing a li­censed pi­lot. It was his first live broad­cast stunt since 2012.</p>
