    <p>Cap­tain (NS) Ab­dul Han­iff Ab­dul Kha­lik was about three months into his com­mand and staff course, which pre­pares ser­vice­men for more se­nior ap­point­ments in the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces (SAF), when the cir­cuit breaker forced all lessons to be moved on­line.</p>
    <p>He was ap­pre­hen­sive about the change, ini­tially. “For us ma­ture stu­dents with chil­dren and work com­mit­ments, the move to home-based learn­ing was pretty chal­leng­ing,” said the 39-year-old fa­ther of three, an oper­a­tionally ready na­tional ser­vice­man who is a se­nior man­ager at se­cu­rity ser­vices provider Cer­tis.</p>
    <p>So he was glad when he was al­lowed to re­turn to the cam­pus at Safti Mil­i­tary Institute in June. Capt (NS) Han­iff found the safety mea­sures put in place by the Goh Keng Swee Com­mand and Staff Col­lege ef­fec­tive and re­as­sur­ing.</p>
    <p>Can­di­dates were split into groups of 10, known as “min­i­mal learn­ing units”, to en­force so­cial dis­tanc­ing when they re­turned for the res­i­den­tial phase at the col­lege. All lec­tures were con­ducted on­line even when trainees were in camp.</p>
    <p>“The col­lege gave all the mea­sures quite a bit of thought as we had stag­gered ar­rival times, and even dis­persed lo­ca­tions for meals,” he said.</p>
    <p>Capt (NS) Han­iff was among the grad­uands of three com­mand and staff cour­ses at a cer­e­mony at Safti Mil­i­tary Institute yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The cer­e­mony took place si­mul­ta­ne­ously at dif­fer­ent lo­ca­tions in the train­ing institute to main­tain so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>In a speech, De­fence Min­is­ter Ng Eng Hen, guest of hon­our at the event, con­grat­u­lated the grad­u­ates for car­ry­ing on de­spite the Covid-19 pan­demic, in­clud­ing those from other coun­tries who re­mained in Sin­ga­pore to com­plete the course. “De­spite the out­break, we have roughly the same num­ber of grad­uands as pre­vi­ous years, 226 in to­tal, in­clud­ing 49 na­tional ser­vice (NS) com­man­ders, one Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force of­fi­cer and 20 in­ter­na­tional of­fi­cers from 13 coun­tries,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The par­tic­i­pa­tion of these in­ter­na­tional of­fi­cers re­flects the mu­tual trust and close­ness of ties be­tween us and their home coun­tries,” he added.</p>
    <p>The grad­u­ates were from three dif­fer­ent vari­a­tions of the com­mand and staff course un­der the SAF col­lege. These were for reg­u­lars, an equiv­a­lent one for na­tional ser­vice­men and two batches of the ver­sion de­signed for ex­ec­u­tive per­son­nel like mil­i­tary ex­perts.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of De­fence web­site says the com­mand and staff cour­ses rep­re­sent the high­est level of for­mal mil­i­tary ed­u­ca­tion of­fered in Sin­ga­pore for reg­u­lar, na­tional ser­vice and in­ter­na­tional of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>In his speech, Dr Ng also noted that na­tional se­cu­rity threats had not di­min­ished de­spite the pan­demic and Sin­ga­pore must cope with the pres­sures of an in­creas­ingly con­nected and yet vul­ner­a­ble world.</p>
    <p>“Cli­mate change, cross-bor­der ter­ror­ism, cy­ber­crime, mar­itime dis­putes and mal­prac­tices con­tinue around the world,” he said.</p>
    <p>He re­it­er­ated that Sin­ga­pore’s de­fence forces must be able to deal with both se­cu­rity and the virus si­mul­ta­ne­ously. “We have to deal with the pan­demic but we can­not ne­glect or let down our guard against other se­cu­rity threats,” he said.</p>
