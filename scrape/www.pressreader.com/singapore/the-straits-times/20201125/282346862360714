    <p>NEW YORK • Bit­coin in­vestors, which in­clude top hedge funds and money man­agers, are bet­ting the vir­tual cur­rency could more than quin­tu­ple to as high as US$100,000 in a year.</p>
    <p>It is a wa­ger that has drawn eye­rolls from scep­tics who be­lieve the volatile cryp­tocur­rency is a spec­u­la­tive as­set rather than a store of value like gold.</p>
    <p>Since Jan­uary, bit­coin has gained 160 per cent, bol­stered by strong in­sti­tu­tional de­mand as well as scarcity, as pay­ment com­pa­nies such as Square and Pay­Pal buy it on be­half of cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Bit­coin is within sight of its all­time peak of just un­der US$20,000 hit in De­cem­ber 2017. It de­buted in 2011 at zero and was last trad­ing at US$18,415.</p>
    <p>Go­ing from US$18,000 to US$100,000 in one year is not a stretch, said Mr Brian Estes, chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer at hedge fund Off The Chain Cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>“I have seen bit­coin go up 10 times, 20 times, 30 times in a year. So go­ing up five times is not a big deal.”</p>
    <p>Mr Estes pre­dicts bit­coin could hit be­tween US$100,000 and US$288,000 by the end of next year, based on a model that utilises the stock-to-flow ratio mea­sur­ing the scarcity of com­modi­ties like gold. That model, he said, has a 94 per cent cor­re­la­tion with the price of bit­coin.</p>
    <p>Citi tech­ni­cal an­a­lyst Tom Fitz­patrick said in a note last week that bit­coin could climb as high as US$318,000 by the end of next year, cit­ing its lim­ited sup­ply, ease of move­ment across bor­ders and opaque own­er­ship.</p>
    <p>Those num­bers, though, are a head-scratcher for Toronto-based Kevin Muir, an in­de­pen­dent pro­pri­etary trader.</p>
    <p>He said: “Any hedge fund model on bit­coin is rub­bish. You can’t model a ma­nia. Is it plau­si­ble? For sure. It’s a ma­nia.</p>
    <p>“But does any­one ac­tu­ally have a clue? Not a chance.”</p>
    <p>DEARTH OF SUP­PLY</p>
    <p>Bit­coin re­lies on so-called “min­ing” com­put­ers that val­i­date blocks of trans­ac­tions by com­pet­ing to solve math­e­mat­i­cal puz­zles ev­ery 10 min­utes. The first to solve the puz­zle and clear the trans­ac­tion is re­warded new bit­coins.</p>
    <p>Its tech­nol­ogy was de­signed to cut the re­ward for min­ers in half ev­ery four years, a move meant to curb in­fla­tion. In May, bit­coin went through a third “halv­ing”, which re­duced the rate at which new coins are cre­ated, re­strict­ing sup­ply.</p>
    <p>That halv­ing has kick-started bit­coin’s re­newed as­cent.</p>
    <p>Square’s Cash App and Pay­Pal, which re­cently launched a crypto ser­vice for its more than 300 mil­lion users, have been scoop­ing up all new bit­coins, hedge fund Pan­tera Cap­i­tal said in its let­ter to in­vestors last Fri­day. That has caused a bit­coin short­age and has driven the rally in the last few weeks.</p>
    <p>BIG FUNDS BUY­ING?</p>
    <p>The so-called whale in­dex, which counts ad­dresses or wal­lets hold­ing at least 1,000 bit­coins, is at an all-time high, said Mr Phil Bonello, re­search direc­tor at dig­i­tal as­set man­ager Grayscale. He said more than 2,200 ad­dresses were linked to large bit­coin hold­ers, up 37 per cent from 1,600 in 2018, sug­gest­ing that in­sti­tu­tional money has stormed in.</p>
    <p>In­vestors such as Mr Stan­ley Druck­en­miller, founder of hedge fund Duquesne Cap­i­tal, and Mr Rick Rieder, Black­Rock’s chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer of global fixed in­come, have re­cently touted bit­coin.</p>
    <p>Re­tail in­vestors, though, are still mostly side­lined due to the pan­demic’s ef­fect on the econ­omy. But with the en­try of Square and Pay­Pal, Mr Len­nard Neo, head of re­search at crypto in­dex fund provider Stack Funds, ex­pects a del­uge of re­tail de­mand more in­tense than in 2017.</p>
    <p>He fore­casts bit­coin to reach US$60,000 to US$80,000 by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>Tem­pus cur­rency trader Juan Perez was unim­pressed, even shocked, with all the lofty fore­casts and said a bet on bit­coin at US$100,000 next year would be a bet on the col­lapse of the global fi­nan­cial sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“Gov­ern­ments around the world won’t let that hap­pen. They will not let fiat cur­ren­cies col­lapse just like that,” he said.</p>
    <p>With bit­coin now close to re­vis­it­ing its De­cem­ber 2017 all-time high of just un­der US$20,000, it is time to look at the rea­sons for its re­cent resur­gence.</p>
    <p>The world’s No. 1 cy­ber as­set has out­per­formed ev­ery other as­set class this year, soar­ing by more than 150 per cent since Jan 1.</p>
    <p>By con­trast, the S&P 500 has risen just over 9 per cent in the same pe­riod, while gold is up around 26 per cent.</p>
    <p>Bit­coin was also the best-per­form­ing as­set last year. So what is go­ing on? Is this another bit­coin bub­ble, as in 2017, or has some­thing fun­da­men­tally changed?</p>
    <p>The pop­ping of the 2017 bub­ble, which led bit­coin to crash 83 per cent by Dec 7, 2018, from its peak just un­der a year ear­lier, can be traced to sev­eral forces.</p>
    <p>First, af­ter al­most 10 years of keep­ing the bench­mark Fed funds rate at close to zero, the United States Fed­eral Re­serve hiked in­ter­est rates re­peat­edly in 2018, al­most dou­bling the Fed funds rate over the year to 2.4 per cent. It also shrank its bal­ance sheet, which fur­ther tight­ened mon­e­tary pol­icy.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, sev­eral risk as­sets took a hit, in­clud­ing stocks, bonds, gold and most of all, bit­coin. When the Fed stopped rais­ing rates last year and re­sumed ex­pand­ing its bal­ance sheet, risk as­sets turned up – again, most of all, bit­coin.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, crypto ex­changes had some se­ri­ous se­cu­rity is­sues. In Jan­uary 2018, the Ja­panese ex­change Coincheck was hacked and some US$500 mil­lion (S$672 mil­lion) worth of crypto as­sets stolen. Then in June 2018, there was another hack, this time at the</p>
    <p>South Korean crypto ex­change Coin­rail, in which about US$40 mil­lion worth of crypto as­sets dis­ap­peared.</p>
    <p>These in­ci­dents, which prompted gov­ern­ments to crack down on crypto ex­changes, scared off many in­vestors and al­most cer­tainly ac­cel­er­ated bit­coin’s de­cline.</p>
    <p>Third, there were no easy path­ways for main­stream in­vestors to in­vest in bit­coin. Banks would not be cus­to­di­ans of it, and few bro­ker-deal­ers were of­fer­ing crypto as­sets.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral fi­nan­cial celebri­ties at the time, in­clud­ing The Van­guard Group founder John Bogle, JPMor­gan chief ex­ec­u­tive Jamie Di­mon and leg­endary in­vestor War­ren Buf­fett, had pooh-poohed bit­coin.</p>
    <p>Mr Bogle ad­vised in­vestors to “avoid it like the plague”; Mr Di­mon called it “a fraud” (al­though he later re­gret­ted that re­mark); while Mr Buf­fett de­scribed it as “rat poi­son squared”.</p>
    <p>Some distin­guished economists, such as No­bel lau­re­ate Joe Stiglitz, called for it to be banned, declar­ing that it served no use­ful pur­pose “other than cir­cum­vent­ing le­gal­ity”.</p>
    <p>A DIF­FER­ENT WORLD</p>
    <p>But fast-for­ward­ing to this year, the sit­u­a­tion is to­tally dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>In the wake of the Covid-19 out­break, the Fed is step­ping on the mon­e­tary ac­cel­er­a­tor as never be­fore. The charts for the US’ broad money sup­ply as well as the Fed’s bal­ance sheet have gone ver­ti­cal.</p>
    <p>US fed­eral debt is close to 100 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, and much of it could end up be­ing mon­e­tised.</p>
    <p>More­over, the Fed has sig­nalled that it plans to keep in­ter­est rates at near zero till at least 2023.</p>
    <p>Nor is the Fed the only cen­tral bank on a money-print­ing binge. The Euro­pean Cen­tral Bank and the Bank of Ja­pan are run­ning neg­a­tive in­ter­est rates. The Bank of Eng­land might soon fol­low.</p>
    <p>In­vestors in bit­coin view this tsunami of mon­e­tary ex­pan­sion as a bless­ing. One of the key char­ac­ter­is­tics of bit­coin is that its sup­ply is fixed at 21 mil­lion bit­coin. That is writ­ten into its al­go­rithm, and no­body can change it.</p>
    <p>Look­ing at the ex­po­nen­tially grow­ing sup­ply of fiat cur­ren­cies and the po­ten­tial for their de­base­ment, as well as higher in­fla­tion, bit­coin in­vestors be­lieve they are sit­ting on the ul­ti­mate scarce and most pris­tine re­serve as­set – bet­ter even than gold, which is not as sup­ply-con­strained, nor as easy to store, ver­ify or trans­fer.</p>
    <p>As some en­thu­si­asts put it, “bit­coin is bet­ter at be­ing gold than gold”.</p>
    <p>GO­ING MAIN­STREAM</p>
    <p>But per­haps most sig­nif­i­cantly, bit­coin – once the pre­serve of tech­nol­ogy geeks – has started to go main­stream.</p>
    <p>Along with other crypto as­sets, it is avail­able on an in­creas­ing num­ber of on­line trad­ing plat­forms. Some bro­ker­ages have started to of­fer bit­coin.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, one of the world’s largest money man­agers, Fi­delity In­vest­ments, an­nounced that it would launch a bit­coin fund, which will open the way for fam­ily of­fices, in­vest­ment ad­vis­ers and in­sti­tu­tions to in­vest in the cryp­tocur­rency.</p>
    <p>Last month, on­line pay­ment com­pany Pay­Pal, which boasts</p>
    <p>346 mil­lion ac­tive ac­counts, an­nounced that it will soon en­able its cus­tomers to buy and sell bit­coin and other crypto as­sets on its plat­form.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore last month, DBS Bank caused a stir among the crypto com­mu­nity when it an­nounced on­line that its newly cre­ated DBS Dig­i­tal Ex­change will of­fer trad­ing in four crypto as­sets: bit­coin, ether, rip­ple and bit­coin cash against cur­ren­cies that in­clude the Sin­ga­pore dol­lar, US dol­lar, Hong Kong dol­lar and Ja­panese yen.</p>
    <p>The web­page was taken down soon af­ter it was put up – re­port­edly be­cause DBS still needed to ob­tain reg­u­la­tory ap­proval – but the ever-vig­i­lant crypto com­mu­nity, as well as the main­stream me­dia, spot­ted and shared the an­nounce­ment.</p>
    <p>DBS Bank ven­tur­ing into the crypto space would be about as main­stream as you can get in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Then in an un­usual de­vel­op­ment this year, at least two listed com­pa­nies – Mi­croS­trat­egy and Square – an­nounced that they had trans­ferred a large chunk of their trea­sury as­sets into bit­coin.</p>
    <p>Mi­croS­trat­egy’s founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive Michael Say­lor said that he de­cided to put US$425 mil­lion into bit­coin be­cause his com­pany was “sit­ting on a US$500 mil­lion melt­ing ice cube”, in the form of a trea­sury cash pile that was los­ing value in real terms in a zero-in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>He con­sid­ers bit­coin to be “the Face­book of mon­e­tary net­works”.</p>
    <p>Crypto en­thu­si­asts be­lieve that more cor­po­rate trea­suries may join the band­wagon.</p>
    <p>Also, lately, far from trash­ing bit­coin, in­vest­ment celebri­ties have been pil­ing into it. They in­clude star fund man­agers</p>
    <p>Paul Tu­dor Jones, Stan­ley Druck­en­miller, Michael Novo­gratz and Cathie Wood.</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of smaller money man­agers have also loaded up on it.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the 2020 Crypto Hedge Fund Re­port is­sued by con­sult­ing firm PwC, the to­tal as­sets un­der man­age­ment of such funds glob­ally more than dou­bled to over US$2 bil­lion last year from US$1 bil­lion the pre­vi­ous year.</p>
    <p>A re­cent sur­vey of 700 re­spon­dents by Sin­ga­pore-based fi­nan­cial ad­vi­sory firm deVere Group re­vealed that nearly three-quar­ters of high-net-worth in­di­vid­u­als glob­ally will be in­vested in cryp­tocur­ren­cies be­fore the end of 2022.</p>
    <p>DRAW­BACKS AND RISKS</p>
    <p>While bit­coin is gain­ing trac­tion among main­stream in­vestors, it has its draw­backs.</p>
    <p>One is that it is still not user-friendly for the lay in­vestor. Trad­ing it is not as easy as, say, trad­ing stocks. Most banks – even pri­vate banks – still do not of­fer it as an in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>Nor is it well es­tab­lished as a unit of ac­count or medium of ex­change in the real world. You can hardly buy any­thing with bit­coin, which ex­ists pri­mar­ily in the dig­i­tal world.</p>
    <p>Its trans­ac­tion speed is still slow – a sin­gle trans­ac­tion can take hours to process, while Visa and Master­card can han­dle 5,000 trans­ac­tions a sec­ond – al­though the bit­coin net­work is de­cen­tralised, un­like Visa or Master­card, and there­fore deemed safer, and some bank wire trans­fers can also take days.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, bit­coin is fa­mously volatile – it has been known to go down 30 per cent within a few hours, which makes it an un­re­li­able store of value ex­cept per­haps over the very long term.</p>
    <p>How­ever, bit­coin bulls point out that volatil­ity is com­mon in any emerg­ing as­set, and will de­crease as the cryp­tocur­rency’s mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion in­creases.</p>
    <p>This is a re­minder that among as­set classes, bit­coin is still tiny. Its mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion is cur­rently only about US$340 bil­lion – which is less than half that of Face­book.</p>
    <p>By con­trast, global bond mar­kets are cap­i­talised at more than US$125 tril­lion, the list­ings on the New York Stock Ex­change alone ag­gre­gate about US$28 tril­lion, and gold is at about US$11 tril­lion.</p>
    <p>Bit­coin mavens re­gard the small­ness of its mar­ket cap to be a sign of its up­side po­ten­tial, which they be­lieve is mas­sive.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, it is still sub­ject to reg­u­la­tory risk. To the ex­tent that it dis­rupts the busi­ness of banks, some an­a­lysts think that gov­ern­ments could try to reg­u­late it to pro­tect tra­di­tional fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>In ex­tremis, gov­ern­ments could even, as Mr Stiglitz has sug­gested, ban bit­coin. A few, such as Bangladesh, Bo­livia and Iran, al­ready have, while some oth­ers, such as Den­mark, In­dia and Thai­land, have dis­cour­aged its use.</p>
    <p>Tougher reg­u­la­tions tar­get­ing it might be a big­ger dan­ger the big­ger bit­coin be­comes.</p>
    <p>Given its tiny size among as­set classes, most reg­u­la­tors do not con­sider it much of a threat now. But they could change their view if it were to be­come a multi-tril­lion-dol­lar as­set class and start mak­ing se­ri­ous in­roads into the busi­ness of con­ven­tional fi­nance.</p>
    <p>How­ever bit­coin bulls point out that short of shut­ting down the In­ter­net, get­ting rid of bit­coin would be tech­ni­cally im­pos­si­ble, as it is on a dis­trib­uted ledger that no­body owns. If some coun­tries ban it, oth­ers will adopt or tol­er­ate it.</p>
    <p>Mr Raoul Pal, chief ex­ec­u­tive and co-founder of in­vest­ment dis­cus­sion plat­form RealVi­sion, likens it to “a cock­roach in fi­nance, some­thing you can never kill”.</p>
    <p>In­vest­ment ad­viser Lyn Alden of Lyn Alden In­vest­ment Strat­egy, who is also bullish on bit­coin, sug­gests that any heavy-handed reg­u­la­tion would also be­come in­creas­ingly dif­fi­cult po­lit­i­cally as more in­sti­tu­tions are ex­posed to bit­coin.</p>
    <p>“Try­ing to ban it would be an at­tack on the bal­ance sheets of cor­po­ra­tions, funds, banks, and in­vestors that own it, and would not be pop­u­lar among mil­lions of vot­ers that own it,” she points out.</p>
    <p>So bit­coin is likely to be here to stay. Where it will go is any­body’s guess.</p>
    <p>As usual, there are some moon­shot fore­casts. Ear­lier this month, Mr Novo­gratz pre­dicted it would hit US$65,000. Many oth­ers pre­dict it will go to US$100,000 or more. Mr Tom Fitz­patrick, a strate­gist at Cit­i­group, has ven­tured that it will go to US$318,000 by the end of next year. Ms Wood says US$500,000 even­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>More bear­ish com­men­ta­tors warn against get­ting car­ried away by “mo­men­tum ma­nia”.</p>
    <p>You can take your pick. But look­ing at what is hap­pen­ing on the macro front and at the pace of main­stream adop­tion of crypto as­sets, it’s far from ob­vi­ous at this stage that bit­coin is in bub­ble ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>What is more cer­tain, though, and un­der-ap­pre­ci­ated, is that bit­coin is the fi­nan­cial virus of our time.</p>
