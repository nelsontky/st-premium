    <p>NEW YORK • Three weeks of World TeamTen­nis (WTT) at the Green­brier re­sort in West Vir­ginia had come down to a sin­gle point on Sun­day. In the last match of the fi­nal, the New York Em­pire and the Chicago Smash had a si­mul­ta­ne­ous cham­pi­onship point at 6-6 in the de­ci­sive women’s dou­bles tiebreaker.</p>
    <p>Sloane Stephens of the Smash hit her first serve in play. Coco Van­deweghe of the Em­pire took a bold fore­hand cut and her re­turn landed deep near the base­line. There was no call by a line j udge, be­cause there were no line judges on the court. In­stead, the crit­i­cal call was made elec­tron­i­cally, and though Stephens and the Smash asked to see a re­play of the vir­tual ball mark, it only con­firmed the judg­ment of the ma­chine. The re­play showed Van­deweghe’s shot had landed on the back half of the base­line and the Em­pire won 21-20.</p>
    <p>WTT was us­ing Hawk-Eye Live, an au­to­mated sys­tem that elim­i­nates line judges and the chal­lenge setup in which play­ers can ask for hu­man calls to be re­viewed by an elec­tronic sys­tem. With Hawk-Eye Live, the elec­tronic sys­tem makes all the calls, even if there are some fa­mil­iar touches like the recorded voices that shout “out”, “fault” or “foot fault”.</p>
    <p>“For us, ac­tu­ally hav­ing a hu­man voice still call ‘out’ rather than us­ing a beep or some other sound was an im­por­tant part of making sure the feel of the sport didn’t change,” said James Japhet, the man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Hawk-Eye North Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>But there is no doubt that HawkEye Live rep­re­sents ma­jor change and later this month it is set to make its Grand Slam de­but.</p>
    <p>The United States Ten­nis As­so­ci­a­tion (USTA) plans to de­ploy it on all but its two big­gest show courts at the US Open, sched­uled for Aug 31-Sept 13. The US Open was the first Ma­jor event to use elec­tronic line call­ing for its chal­lenge sys­tem in 2006. In 2018, it be­came the first Grand Slam event to make that avail­able on all its courts. Now Hawk-Eye will go from serv­ing as qual­ity con­trol and a broad­cast tool to be­ing the first and fi­nal word.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem will also be used at the West­ern & South­ern Open, the com­bined WTA and ATP event trans­planted from the Cincin­nati sub­urbs that is sched­uled for the week be­fore the US Open at the USTA Bil­lie Jean King Na­tional Ten­nis Cen­tre in New York City.</p>
    <p>“Is the sys­tem perfect? Prob­a­bly not,” said WTT chief ex­ec­u­tive Car­los Silva. “Is it close to perfect? Yes. Is it more perfect than hu­mans? 100 per cent yes.”</p>
    <p>It has the po­ten­tial to put quite a few hu­man line judges out of work, which is partly why the sport has been slow to adopt Hawk-Eye Live. There is also con­cern that it could make it more dif­fi­cult to de­velop qual­ity chair um­pires be­cause line judg­ing is the typ­i­cal path­way to the chair.</p>
    <p>“We’re not in the busi­ness of try­ing to re­move peo­ple from the sport,” Japhet said. “It just hap­pens to have been a by-prod­uct of this par­tic­u­lar ad­vance­ment of the tech­nol­ogy.”</p>
    <p>WTT chose to forgo line judges and use Hawk-Eye Live for the last three years. The men’s Tour has done the same since 2017 at its Next Gen ATP Fi­nals, an ex­per­i­men­tal event for the best play­ers un­der the age of 22. But what is driv­ing the US Open’s de­ci­sion above all is the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and the need to main­tain safety.</p>
    <p>By us­ing Hawk-Eye Live on 15 of the 17 match courts, the US Open can dras­ti­cally re­duce the num­ber of line judges on site: from ap­prox­i­mately 350 to well un­der 100.</p>
    <p>Only Arthur Ashe Sta­dium and Louis Arm­strong Sta­dium will still fea­ture full, of­fi­ci­at­ing crews of nine line judges. The other courts will have only a chair um­pire, who will call the score and who will fo­cus more on mon­i­tor­ing player behaviour and the pace of play.</p>
    <p>The um­pires can­not over­rule the ma­chines on line calls, only tak­ing over if the sys­tem breaks down. If the au­dio sys­tem were to fail, a light at­tached to the um­pire’s chair would still in­di­cate when HawkEye has de­ter­mined a shot is out.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem is not en­tirely glitch­free. Japhet said Hawk-Eye of­fi­cials mon­i­tor­ing the sys­tem have ac­cess to a broad­cast feed as an ad­di­tional tool for rare prob­lem­atic oc­ca­sions. But he said the au­to­mated sys­tem had been tested and shown to be ac­cu­rate within 2mm.</p>
    <p>The ATP Tour has tem­porar­ily ap­proved the sys­tem’s use at all ATP events be­cause of the pan­demic. The women’s Tour has for ap­proved its use at the West­ern & South­ern Open, which will be the first WTA event to use the sys­tem.</p>
    <p>HU­MANS OUT</p>
    <p>We’re not in the busi­ness of try­ing to re­move peo­ple from the sport. It just hap­pens to have been a by-prod­uct of this par­tic­u­lar ad­vance­ment of the tech­nol­ogy. ’’</p>
    <p>JAMES JAPHET, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Hawk-Eye North Amer­ica, ex­pects an in­crease in Hawk-Eye Live use be­cause of the pan­demic, the sys­tem’s pre­ci­sion and costs.</p>
