    <p>In the liv­ing room of a four-room Hous­ing Board flat in Wham­poa, two large fig­urines of Bruce Lee stand guard.</p>
    <p>One has the mar­tial arts film star in his Fist Of Fury (1972) get-up and the other in his iconic yel­low Game Of Death (1978) jump­suit.</p>
    <p>The walls are adorned with framed photos and glass cab­i­nets show­case end­less rows of Bruce Lee mem­o­ra­bilia. Hun­dreds of mag­a­zines and books with the late Hong Kong-Amer­i­can star on the cover are stowed away neatly.</p>
    <p>The flat’s owner is Mr Jack­son Yeo, an avid Bruce Lee fan and sou­venir col­lec­tor.</p>
    <p>Ahead of what would have been the star’s 80th birth­day this month, Mr Yeo tells The Sun­day Times his love for Lee feels “like fate”.</p>
    <p>The 57-year-old hawker stall owner says he watched re-runs of Lee’s tele­vi­sion se­ries The Green Hor­net (1966 to 1967) since he was nine and was quickly en­rap­tured.</p>
    <p>“It’s fate. I don’t like any other mar­tial arts star, but he’s the one hero I wor­ship and love the most,” he says in Man­darin.</p>
    <p>When Lee died sud­denly at the age of 32 in 1973 due to swelling in his brain, Mr Yeo was 10.</p>
    <p>“There def­i­nitely was a sense of: ‘Oh I was just get­ting to know him and now he’s dead’,’’ he re­calls.</p>
    <p>Yet, death did not dampen his ar­dour.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo be­gan col­lect­ing Bruce Lee goods when he was 13 – start­ing with a black-and-white photo of the star that he still dis­plays in the flat, which was pre­vi­ously oc­cu­pied by his late mother.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo, who is mar­ried with two adult chil­dren in their 20s, lives with his fam­ily in an­other flat in Sin­ga­pore’s north-east.</p>
    <p>Asked how much he has spent on his 44-year-old col­lec­tion, he says it is im­pos­si­ble to cal­cu­late.</p>
    <p>He es­ti­mates that he spends $3,000 to $5,000 a year ac­quir­ing new items. His most ex­pen­sive pur­chase? A hand­made fig­urine from a Chi­nese sculp­tor cost­ing about $3,000.</p>
    <p>While other col­lec­tors oc­ca­sion­ally buy, sell and trade up their keep­sakes, he has never done so. “For me, things come in, but they never go out,” he says with a laugh.</p>
    <p>He usu­ally buys new pieces from Hong Kong, where he has been a mem­ber of the Bruce Lee Club since 1996.</p>
    <p>“I’ll travel to Hong Kong, maybe once or twice a year – in July (Lee’s death an­niver­sary) and November (Lee’s birth­day) and I’ll see what there is to buy.</p>
    <p>“This year is his 80th birth­day, but be­cause of Covid-19, I haven’t been able to stock up or meet up with my friends from the Bruce Lee Club.”</p>
    <p>Over the years, he has gone on tours with the group’s mem­bers, such as to Shuntak i n China’s Guang­dong prov­ince, where Lee’s an­ces­tral home is. He has even met Lee’s fam­ily, in­clud­ing his brother Robert Lee, dur­ing events in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Asked why he adores Lee so much, Mr Yeo says: “I’ve been ask­ing my­self that ques­tion for many years too. I’m not sure why ei­ther. I think he made the Chi­nese com­mu­nity re­ally proud by be­com­ing an in­ter­na­tional star.</p>
    <p>“Even un­til now, there are peo­ple in Amer­ica, Ja­pan, Hong Kong and Tai­wan who love him.”</p>
    <p>To him, Lee also ex­em­pli­fies a spirit and an ideal.</p>
    <p>“I think he showed that if you work hard, you can achieve your dreams.”</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo was so in­spired he even learnt mar­tial arts – wing chun – in the 1980s.</p>
    <p>“I learnt it for only two months, I was too busy with my business to con­tinue,” he says.</p>
    <p>But per­haps his de­vo­tion to Lee shines through most at his place of work. His roasted meat stall at</p>
    <p>Hong Lim Mar­ket & Food Cen­tre is named The Leg­end, after Lee. His stall front is plas­tered with Bruce Lee posters.</p>
    <p>He says: “Some­times, you see peo­ple who use his name as a gim­mick for their business. But for me, I just wanted a place to show some of the things I’ve col­lected and my love for him.”</p>
    <p>He pre­vi­ously ran an eatery in Up­per Cir­cu­lar Road, con­tain­ing part of his Bruce Lee col­lec­tion, from 2003 to 2005. But ris­ing rents made him pack up to be­come a hawker.</p>
    <p>He dreams of start­ing a Bruce Lee-themed food business in the</p>
    <p>fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“Maybe if I find some­one will­ing to sup­port this dream of mine, it might still hap­pen,” he says.</p>
    <p>His wife, Mrs Yeo Huey Ling, who helps run his roasted meat stall, is sup­port­ive of his pas­time.</p>
    <p>She says: “Last time, I used to nag at him, but not any­more. He’s been col­lect­ing Bruce Lee items even be­fore we got mar­ried and it’s his only hobby aside from run­ning our business.</p>
    <p>“It’s mean­ing­ful. Bruce Lee is a hero to us Chi­nese.”</p>
