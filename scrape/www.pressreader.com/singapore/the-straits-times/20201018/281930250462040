    <p>MA­CON • United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump on Fri­day called for Mr Joe Bi­den and his fam­ily to be jailed, es­ca­lat­ing his at­tacks on his Demo­cratic op­po­nent over un­sup­ported ac­cu­sa­tions as he strug­gles to re­verse his deficit in the polls.</p>
    <p>“Lock up the Bi­dens. Lock up Hil­lary (Clin­ton),” Mr Trump de­clared at a rally in Ma­con, Ge­or­gia, stok­ing the crowd that chanted “lock him up” in favour of the Demo­cratic can­di­date’s im­pris­on­ment.</p>
    <p>“We’ve learnt over the last cou­ple of months: Joe Bi­den is a cor­rupt politi­cian and the Bi­den fam­ily is a crim­i­nal en­ter­prise,” Mr Trump said to his sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump fre­quently de­manded that his 2016 Demo­cratic op­po­nent, Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton, be in­car­cer­ated over her use of a pri­vate e-mail server as sec­re­tary of state.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day’s at­tack was be­lieved to be the first time he has ever used that sort of at­tack against the Bi­dens.</p>
    <p>The Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion de­clined in 2016 to rec­om­mend charges against Mrs Clin­ton for send­ing a small num­ber of clas­si­fied e-mails through a pri­vate server at her New York home.</p>
    <p>Trail­ing be­hind Mr Bi­den in most opin­ion polls, with the elec­tion less than three weeks away, Mr Trump has ze­roed in on a New York Post re­port from last week that high­lighted doc­u­ments pur­port­ing to show the busi­ness deal­ings of Mr Bi­den’s son in Ukraine and China.</p>
    <p>The ar­ti­cle, cit­ing un­ver­i­fied emails from a lap­top aban­doned at a Delaware com­puter re­pair shop, al­leged that Mr Hunter Bi­den in­tro­duced a Ukrainian busi­ness­man to his father, who has said that he has never talked with his son about his in­ter­na­tional busi­ness deal­ings.</p>
    <p>The e-mails pro­vided no proof of a meet­ing. The busi­ness­man, ac­cord­ing to the ar­ti­cle, thanked Mr Hunter Bi­den for “the op­por­tu­nity to meet your father”.</p>
    <p>The Bi­den cam­paign said the former vice-pres­i­dent’s cal­en­dars turned up no record that he ever met the busi­ness­man.</p>
    <p>The lap­top’s hard drive was given to Trump ally Steve Ban­non, who gave it to Mr Rudy Gi­u­liani’s lawyer, Mr Robert Costello. Mr Gi­u­liani, who is Mr Trump’s lawyer, gave it to the New York Post.</p>
    <p>When asked about the re­ports, Mr Bi­den said: “I have no re­sponse. An­other smear cam­paign.”</p>
    <p>The Wash­ing­ton Post re­ported last week that Mr Trump was warned last year that Mr Gi­u­liani had be­come the tar­get of Rus­sian in­tel­li­gence for an in­flu­ence op­er­a­tion. Mr Gi­u­liani’s ef­forts to ob­tain dis­parag­ing in­for­ma­tion about the Bi­dens from Ukrainian of­fi­cials con­trib­uted to Mr Trump’s im­peach­ment in the House.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den and Mr Trump are sched­uled to meet for a pres­i­den­tial de­bate in Nashville on Thurs­day, their fi­nal en­counter of the 2020 cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing Fri­day’s rally, Mr Trump also raised the pos­si­bil­ity of a loss to Mr Bi­den, though mak­ing light of it.</p>
    <p>“I shouldn’t joke be­cause you know what, run­ning against the worst can­di­date in the his­tory of pres­i­den­tial pol­i­tics puts pres­sure on me,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Could you imag­ine if I lose? My whole life, what am I go­ing to do, I’m go­ing to say, I lost to the worst can­di­date in the his­tory of pol­i­tics. I’m not go­ing to feel so good. Maybe I’ll have to leave the coun­try, I don’t know.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump was ex­pected to cam­paign yes­ter­day in Michi­gan and Wis­con­sin, be­fore launch­ing a tour of western states to shore up po­lit­i­cal sup­port.</p>
    <p>The former New York busi­ness­man pre­vailed in Michi­gan and Wis­con­sin in 2016, but polls show him run­ning be­hind Mr Bi­den in those states this year.</p>
    <p>Lock up the Bi­dens. Lock up Hil­lary... We’ve learnt over the last cou­ple of months: Joe Bi­den is a cor­rupt politi­cian and the Bi­den fam­ily is a crim­i­nal en­ter­prise.</p>
