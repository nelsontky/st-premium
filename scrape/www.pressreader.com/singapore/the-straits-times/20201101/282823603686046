    <p>Money man­agers in Asia are de­ploy­ing a range of tra­di­tional and un­con­ven­tional strate­gies to cush­ion any losses as they brace them­selves for tur­bu­lence in the lead-up to and af­ter­math of the United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese eq­ui­ties fea­ture high in some rec­om­men­da­tions on ex­pec­ta­tions that the vote will have a limited im­pact on Asian as­sets, while de­riv­a­tives that pro­tect against a mar­ket slide are also listed among the strate­gies.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral in­vestors sug­gest more con­ven­tional hedges such as the yen and gold, as well as just hold­ing cash to avoid risk ex­po­sure.</p>
    <p>And even as elec­tion fears ebb with US polls show­ing a widen­ing lead for Demo­cratic can­di­date Joe Bi­den, a Bank of Amer­ica sur­vey showed global fund man­agers are ready for ex­treme mar­ket volatil­ity as they ex­pect the elec­tion out­come to be con­tested.</p>
    <p>“Global risk as­sets could ex­pe­ri­ence near-term volatil­ity as a dis­puted elec­tion could ini­tially put down­ward pres­sure on them and cause a flight to safety,” said Mr David Chao, mar­ket strate­gist for</p>
    <p>Asia-Pa­cific ex-Ja­pan at In­vesco. “A di­ver­si­fied port­fo­lio makes sense, es­pe­cially one that in­cludes safe-haven as­sets and mar­ket-neu­tral strate­gies.”</p>
    <p>ASIA AL­LURE</p>
    <p>Mr Thomas Poul­laouec, head of multi-as­set so­lu­tions for Asia-Pa­cific at T. Rowe Price, said that “it seems ra­tio­nal to fo­cus on Asia ver­sus the US to re­duce elec­tion risk”, given the re­gion’s strong earn­ings re­vi­sions, eco­nomic re­cov­ery and at­trac­tive val­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The re­gion’s out­per­for­mance could con­tinue in the short term, he added, af­ter the MSCI Asia-Pa­cific In­dex beat the S&P 500 In­dex by more than 2 per­cent­age points in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>The Asian mea­sure was up 3.2 per cent as at the end of last month, track­ing the 3.6 per cent gain in the US gauge.</p>
    <p>DEMO­CRATIC SWEEP IN THE U.S. COULD BOOST ASIAN STOCKS</p>
    <p>In­vesco and State Street Global Mar­kets con­tinue to favour Chi­nese eq­ui­ties be­cause of the coun­try’s faster pace of eco­nomic</p>
    <p>re­cov­ery and big ex­po­sure to tech­nol­ogy names.</p>
    <p>A Bi­den win would sig­nal less chaos in re­la­tions with the US, “which would be pos­i­tive for the Chi­nese stock mar­ket”, said Mr Mark Matthews, head of Asia re­search at Bank Julius Baer.</p>
    <p>BUY­ING PUTS</p>
    <p>BNP Paribas As­set Man­age­ment has turned to de­riv­a­tives to pro­tect against a slide in US eq­ui­ties, with the S&P 500 close to an all­time high.</p>
    <p>“It is worth it to spend some of that gain on down­side put pro­tec­tion, for which costs can be neu­tralised by sell­ing up­side calls at least with tenors into mid-Novem­ber,” said Mr Paul Sandhu, the firm’s head of multi-as­set quant so­lu­tions and client ad­vi­sory for</p>
    <p>Asia-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>AUSSIE DOL­LAR</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian dol­lar is the tool of choice to pro­tect core in­vest­ment po­si­tions ahead of the US elec­tion for strate­gists at Cit­i­group.</p>
    <p>A look at the cor­re­la­tions be­tween bench­mark US yields and stocks sug­gests Trea­suries are not as ef­fec­tive as a risk-off hedge as they used to be, while haven ral­lies in the dol­lar are “less po­tent”, a team in­clud­ing Mr Jeremy Hale wrote in a note.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian dol­lar – es­pe­cially against the Swiss franc – has been much more cor­re­lated to stocks, leav­ing it bet­ter placed as an av­enue to build short po­si­tions as a hedge against eq­uity down­side, they said.</p>
    <p>Mr Adrian Zuercher, head of</p>
    <p>global as­set al­lo­ca­tion at UBS Group’s wealth man­age­ment arm, is op­ti­mistic about the months ahead, but still mind­ful of the risks re­lated to the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“So we con­tinue to ad­vo­cate hold­ing gold, adding yield for di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion, and shift­ing some of our lin­ear eq­uity ex­po­sure into op­tion­al­ity, which should give us pos­i­tive re­turns in fall­ing and ris­ing mar­kets,” he said.</p>
    <p>UBS Wealth has also turned to­wards lag­ging mar­kets which score well on val­u­a­tions and re­duced ex­po­sure to tech­nol­ogy-sen­si­tive mar­kets, he added.</p>
    <p>“We are long on Sin­ga­pore, which is more a value play, and In­dia, which is a do­mes­tic-driven mar­ket, ver­sus Hong Kong which would see pres­sure from a Trump vic­tory or Thai­land and Malaysia</p>
    <p>which are trade ori­ented,” he said.</p>
    <p>Still, for Julius Baer’s Mr Matthews, cash or high-grade bonds are bet­ter hedges than gold be­cause the yel­low metal has “proved this year that it is more of a risk-on as­set than a risk-off one”.</p>
    <p>RE­FLA­TION PLAYS</p>
    <p>Mr Paul O’Con­nor, head of multi-as­set at Janus Hen­der­son In­vestors, ex­pects the prospect of sus­tained fis­cal eas­ing un­der a strong Demo­crat gov­ern­ment to push real bond yields higher, trig­ger­ing a ro­ta­tion from this year’s win­ning as­sets to­wards the lag­gards.</p>
    <p>He ex­pects t he 10-year US Trea­sury yield could rise to 1 per cent fairly briskly, driven by the prospect of a sus­tained fis­cal eas­ing un­der a strong Demo­crat gov­ern­ment.</p>
