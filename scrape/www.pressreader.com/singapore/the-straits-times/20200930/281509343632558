    <p>For years, Mrs Vir­ginia Ng paid for a StarHub TV plan. But as she and her fam­ily did not tune in to much of its of­fer­ings, she can­celled it two years ago.</p>
    <p>Then the 49-year-old housewife dis­cov­ered Net­flix last year. She was drawn to its ex­clu­sive con­tent as well as the con­ve­nience of be­ing able to watch the shows when­ever she wanted.</p>
    <p>She is among the many view­ers here who have pulled the plug on pay tele­vi­sion and moved to cheaper and more ac­ces­si­ble over­the-top (OTT) stream­ing ser­vices such as Net­flix, HBO Go and Ama­zon Prime Video.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, mar­ket re­search firm Fitch So­lu­tions said pay TV op­er­a­tors Sing­tel and StarHub would con­tinue to see a grad­ual ero­sion of their sub­scriber base.</p>
    <p>By the end of 2029, it fore­cast that there would be 460,660 pay TV sub­scribers here, down from the 704,000 sub­scribers at the end of June. At the peak in March 2015, there were 968,000 sub­scrip­tions.</p>
    <p>Net­flix does not re­veal the num­ber of sub­scribers in Sin­ga­pore, but mar­ket re­searcher Statista es­ti­mates there will be over 264,000 users here by the end of the year – up from 47,000 in 2016, the year Net­flix ar­rived here.</p>
    <p>Re­vers­ing the pay TV down­ward trend will be dif­fi­cult, an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>“Cord cut­ting is in­evitable in ma­ture mar­kets like Sin­ga­pore. High broad­band pen­e­tra­tion and a wide choice of OTT stream­ing ser­vices are putting a lot of pres­sure on the pay TV ser­vices,” notes Ms Khin Sandi Lynn, an an­a­lyst at mar­ket re­search firm ABI Re­search.</p>
    <p>Un­like pay TV ser­vices, which usu­ally tie the user to con­tracts of one to two years, OTT stream­ing ser­vices are ac­ces­si­ble any time and on vir­tu­ally any de­vice. They also of­fer free tri­als and are con­tract-free.</p>
    <p>Fi­nance ex­ec­u­tive Christo­pher Tan, 37, says he still has his Sing­tel TV plan be­cause it of­fers the English Premier League (EPL).</p>
    <p>The Liver­pool fan pays about $70 a month for a bun­dle plan that in­cludes other sports pro­grammes and Asian shows, which he does not watch much of. He had even less screen time when the EPL took a three-month break be­cause of the pan­demic, but still had to pay for the monthly sub­scrip­tion as he was bound by a con­tract.</p>
    <p>He says: “If not for the EPL, I would can­cel my plan and sub­scribe to Net­flix.”</p>
    <p>Stream­ing ser­vices are gen­er­ally cheaper. A ba­sic Net­flix plan costs $11.98 a month, while an Ama­zon Prime Video sub­scrip­tion is $2.99. In com­par­i­son, Sing­tel TV’s con­tent packs start at $16.90 a month, while StarHub’s cheap­est bun­dles cost $15 with a two-year con­tract.</p>
    <p>Mr Kenny Liew, an an­a­lyst at Fitch So­lu­tions, says: “The lack of ads for OTT ser­vices is at­trac­tive, while the ever-ex­pand­ing cat­a­logue of pro­gram­ming – in­clud­ing lo­cal con­tent – also ap­peals to a broad range of view­ers.”</p>
    <p>He feels that pay TV op­er­a­tors need to be­come more like OTT providers, in­stead of lock­ing sub­scribers to de­vices like set-top boxes or their fi­bre net­works.</p>
    <p>Pay TV op­er­a­tors also have to con­tin­u­ously ac­quire di­verse new con­tent at rea­son­able prices to re­main more at­trac­tive, he adds.</p>
    <p>Another ap­proach is to be­come a con­tent ag­gre­ga­tor that bun­dles OTT ser­vices with tra­di­tional pay TV con­tent, says Mr Aravind Venu­gopal, vice-pres­i­dent of mar­ket re­search firm Me­dia Part­ners Asia.</p>
    <p>It ap­pears that both pay TV op­er­a­tors here are wak­ing up to that re­al­ity.</p>
    <p>Asked how it re­tains or at­tracts sub­scribers, Sing­tel points to its Cast OTT ser­vice, which streams on mo­bile, Web and smart TVs, and of­fers con­tract-free op­tions. Launched in 2016, the plat­form in­te­grates sev­eral third-party OTT ser­vices such as HBO Go and Viu.</p>
    <p>As for StarHub, it launched new multi-de­vice plat­form StarHub TV+ this month, which of­fers live TV chan­nels, video-on-de­mand con­tent and OTT stream­ing apps such as Net­flix and HBO Go.</p>
    <p>Users can ac­cess con­tent through the StarHub TV+ mo­bile app, a Web browser or a me­dia stream­ing box (see other story). They can also catch shows – up to 24 hours after they have aired – that they may have missed.</p>
    <p>Mr Jo­han Buse, chief of StarHub’s con­sumer busi­ness group, says: “With the launch of StarHub TV+, our role in the con­tent de­liv­ery chain is to cu­rate and de­liver the op­ti­mal con­tent mix in the most con­ve­nient way for cus­tomers.”</p>
    <p>He adds that with the likely in­flux of new OTT ser­vices to Sin­ga­pore – Dis­ney+, for in­stance, is ex­pected to ar­rive soon – StarHub can sim­plify the con­sumer ex­pe­ri­ence by gath­er­ing th­ese ser­vices on the StarHub TV+ plat­form.</p>
    <p>Mr Venu­gopal says StarHub TV+ is “an in­ter­est­ing first step in the right di­rec­tion”, but ques­tions why StarHub is mak­ing its me­dia stream­ing box avail­able only to sub­scribers, in­stead of of­fer­ing it as a stand­alone de­vice.</p>
    <p>“Given the preva­lence of il­le­gal stream­ing de­vices, it could be­come a le­gal al­ter­na­tive for cus­tomers look­ing for their next stream­ing ser­vice,” he says.</p>
