    <p>LONDON/BRUS­SELS • Bri­tain and the Euro­pean Union yes­ter­day agreed to in­ten­sify trade talks and work on le­gal texts, a break­through of sorts af­ter Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son said he was walk­ing away from ne­go­ti­a­tions that had been dead­locked for weeks.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a week­end of both sides trad­ing blame for the lack of progress and call­ing on the other to move first, chief ne­go­tia­tors David Frost and Michel Barnier were said to have agreed to a Bri­tish de­mand to start work­ing on le­gal texts.</p>
    <p>With just over two months be­fore Bri­tain ends a sta­tus quo tran­si­tion ar­range­ment with the EU, any chance of se­cur­ing a deal to pro­tect bil­lions of dol­lars in trade was hang­ing in the bal­ance.</p>
    <p>It seemed that to try to restart the talks, Mr Frost and Mr Barnier de­cided to jump to­gether, though with both sides far apart on key is­sues, any deal may still be hard to come by.</p>
    <p>“There has been a con­struc­tive move on the part of the Euro­pean Union and... I pre­fer to look for­ward in op­ti­mism rather than nec­es­sar­ily to look back in anger,” Mr Michael Gove, London’s point man on the di­vorce deal, told Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Gove’s new-found op­ti­mism was in stark con­trast to his tone barely half an hour ear­lier, when he is­sued the EU another ul­ti­ma­tum that it must “fun­da­men­tally change” its ap­proach if it wanted to res­cue trade talks.</p>
    <p>Mr Barnier tweeted: “I just spoke to David Frost... I con­firmed that the EU re­mains avail­able to in­ten­sify talks in London this week, on all sub­jects, and based on le­gal texts.”</p>
    <p>What looks like the pos­si­ble re­sump­tion of talks comes af­ter a week­end when both sides blamed the other for their all but fail­ure. But it by no means en­sures that they will reach an agree­ment.</p>
    <p>Ne­go­ti­a­tions broke down last Thurs­day, when the EU de­manded Bri­tain give ground, es­pe­cially over fair com­pe­ti­tion rules, in­clud­ing state aid, and fish­eries.</p>
    <p>In turn, Mr John­son said last Fri­day that there was no point in con­tin­u­ing talks, adding that Bri­tain would “pros­per might­ily” with­out a deal.</p>
    <p>That would mean Bri­tain trad­ing on World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) terms: Tar­iffs would be im­posed un­der WTO rules, likely caus­ing sig­nif­i­cant price rises. Such a sce­nario would throw US$900 bil­lion (S$1.2 tril­lion) in an­nual bi­lat­eral trade into un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>Mr Gove, in Par­lia­ment, re­peated Bri­tain’s de­mands: “We have to be in con­trol of our own bor­ders, our fish­ing grounds, we have to set our own laws; we have to be free to thrive as an in­de­pen­dent free trad­ing na­tion.”</p>
    <p>A no-deal fi­nale to Bri­tain’s fiveyear Brexit drama would dis­rupt the op­er­a­tions of man­u­fac­tur­ers, re­tail­ers, farm­ers and nearly ev­ery other sec­tor – just as the eco­nomic hit from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic wors­ens.</p>
    <p>Re­gard­less, Bri­tain is launch­ing a campaign this week urg­ing busi­nesses to step up prepa­ra­tions for a no-deal de­par­ture.</p>
    <p>“Make no mis­take, there are changes com­ing in just 75 days and time is run­ning out for busi­nesses to act,” Mr Gove said in an ear­lier state­ment.</p>
    <p>More than 70 Bri­tish busi­ness groups rep­re­sent­ing over seven mil­lion work­ers on Sun­day urged politi­cians to get back to the ne­go­ti­at­ing ta­ble and strike a deal.</p>
    <p>I pre­fer to look for­ward in op­ti­mism rather than nec­es­sar­ily to look back in anger.</p>
    <p>MR MICHAEL GOVE, Bri­tain’s point man on the di­vorce deal.</p>
