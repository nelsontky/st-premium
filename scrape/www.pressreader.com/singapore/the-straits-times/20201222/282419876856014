    <p>Wire­card Sin­ga­pore has lost a third of its staff, two months af­ter the au­thor­i­ties here forced the dig­i­tal pay­ments com­pany to cease its core busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties amid an in­ves­ti­ga­tion, The Straits Times has learnt.</p>
    <p>At its peak, the com­pany em­ployed more than 350 peo­ple at its of­fice on the 14th floor of Maple­tree Busi­ness City, where the call cen­tre, sales de­ploy­ment team, re­gional com­mer­cial team and project man­age­ment of­fice are lo­cated.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, Wire­card told The Straits Times it had 250 staff here – in­clud­ing 180 lo­cals.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try sources told ST that those who left the com­pany held roles in IT and re­la­tion­ship man­age­ment. Sin­ga­pore is home to Wire­card’s Asia-Pa­cific headquarte­rs in Pasir Pan­jang.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing work­force is work­ing from home and has been lend­ing sup­port to Wire­card’s busi­nesses in Malaysia and Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, ST un­der­stands the firm is look­ing for a buyer, with at least one party show­ing in­ter­est in ac­quir­ing part of Wire­card’s busi­ness in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Wire­card SG de­clined com­ment ex­cept to say it is com­ply­ing with Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) di­rec­tives, adding: “There have been no re­dun­dan­cies to date.”</p>
    <p>Wire­card SG had been pro­vid­ing pay­ment pro­cess­ing ser­vices to about 1,900 com­pa­nies in Sin­ga­pore be­fore MAS or­dered the firm to stop its pay­ment ser­vices op­er­a­tions on Sept 30.</p>
    <p>MAS also di­rected the firm to re­turn all cus­tomers’ funds within two weeks.</p>
    <p>The shut­down of its pay­ment ser­vices af­fected thou­sands of con­sumers, who were un­able to make on­line or credit card pay­ments with mer­chants on Wire­card SG plat­forms.</p>
    <p>M1, which has more than two mil­lion cus­tomers in Sin­ga­pore, had its monthly re­cur­ring pay­ment op­tion dis­rupted. Pay­ment ser­vices for Safra and Star­bucks were also dis­rupted.</p>
    <p>Af­fected mer­chants were un­able to ac­cept credit card pay­ments from con­sumers un­til they made ar­range­ments with new ser­vice providers.</p>
    <p>Par­ent com­pany Wire­card AG filed for in­sol­vency in Ger­many in June af­ter ad­mit­ting that €1.9 bil­lion (S$3.1 bil­lion) in cash was miss­ing from its ac­counts.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s for­mer chief ex­ec­u­tive Markus Braun and sev­eral other top ex­ec­u­tives have been ar­rested on fraud charges.</p>
    <p>Braun, who faces fraud and em­bez­zle­ment charges, was tem­po­rar­ily re­leased from jail last month to at­tend an in­quiry by law­mak­ers, but he de­clined to an­swer more than 50 ques­tions and de­nied any wrong­do­ing.</p>
    <p>Ger­man pros­e­cu­tors also launched a probe into Ernst & Young’s au­dit of Wire­card AG ear­lier this month, af­ter an ac­count­ing watch­dog filed a re­port ac­cus­ing the firm of crim­i­nal­ity in its work for the failed pay­ments com­pany.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Com­mer­cial Af­fairs Depart­ment (CAD), which deals with white-col­lar crime, has been look­ing into Wire­card’s op­er­a­tions here since Fe­bru­ary last year, af­ter re­ports by the Fi­nan­cial Times raised al­le­ga­tions of fraud at its of­fice in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The CAD is also in­ves­ti­gat­ing a Sin­ga­pore com­pany, Ci­tadelle Cor­po­rate Ser­vices, in re­la­tion to Wire­card’s ac­count­ing scan­dal.</p>
    <p>Ci­tadelle di­rec­tor R. Shan­mu­garat­nam is fac­ing a to­tal of 14 charges from the Sin­ga­pore au­thor­i­ties, in­volv­ing about €1.2 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The charges in­clude 11 counts of fal­si­fy­ing let­ters to var­i­ous Wire­card-re­lated en­ti­ties for which Ci­tadelle al­legedly held mil­lions of eu­ros in es­crow ac­counts, when the ac­counts ei­ther did not hold such sums or were not held by Ci­tadelle.</p>
