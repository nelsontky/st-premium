    <p>The deep eco­nomic pain be­ing felt by Sin­ga­pore­ans due to Covid-19 and a de­sire for di­ver­sity in Par­lia­ment are the two key mes­sages vot­ers sent the Govern­ment in the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion, Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam said.</p>
    <p>While the nearly $100 bil­lion pack­age across four Bud­gets has helped to blunt some of the im­pact of the pan­demic, seg­ments of the pop­u­la­tion – in­clud­ing those aged be­tween 40 and 60 as well as small busi­nesses in sec­tors like con­struc­tion – are hurt­ing very badly, said Mr Shan­mugam in an in­ter­view with Money FM 89.3’s Cla­ressa Mon­teiro broad­cast yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>That is why apart from short­term “blood trans­fu­sions”, the Govern­ment is fo­cused on sav­ing Sin­ga­porean jobs. And where that can­not be done, it has to “try and save ev­ery Sin­ga­porean – try and train them, give them other op­tions to tide through this pe­riod”.</p>
    <p>“We can­not by our­selves wave a magic wand and cre­ate eco­nomic growth in the con­text of a global deep re­ces­sion, but we can tide through and help our peo­ple,” said the min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>In a con­ver­sa­tion billed as a look at hard truths from GE2020, Mr Shan­mugam said the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) is keenly aware of vot­ers’ de­sire for di­ver­sity of rep­re­sen­ta­tion in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>He dis­agreed with some com­men­ta­tors’ view that the 27 new faces the PAP in­tro­duced at the re­cent hus­tings were per­ceived as ca­pa­ble but bor­ing, or that they did not have the same ap­peal as some of the can­di­dates who were put up by the op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>“I would say it’s a dif­fer­ence be­tween per­cep­tion and re­al­ity,” said the min­is­ter, who en­tered pol­i­tics in the 1988 Gen­eral Elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“If you look at the PAP can­di­dates in the eight elec­tions that I’ve been in, this is prob­a­bly the best slate of young can­di­dates – fresh, full of en­ergy, full of ideas, they want to do things.”</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam cited as ex­am­ples the two new mem­bers of his Nee Soon GRC team.</p>
    <p>Ms Car­rie Tan came from hum­ble begin­nings, took on a cor­po­rate job and gave it up to start a non-govern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion that helps un­der­priv­i­leged women.</p>
    <p>Mr Der­rick Goh grew up in a three-room flat in Balam Road, put him­self through univer­sity and worked in global fi­nan­cial cen­tres like Lon­don and New York, be­fore re­turn­ing to Sin­ga­pore to take charge of POSB and re­vamp it. He is now a man­ag­ing direc­tor at DBS.</p>
    <p>“It tells you the world of pos­si­bil­i­ties for all our kids, and the new can­di­dates from the PAP sym­bol­ise that,” said Mr Shan­mugam. “It may be that be­cause there are so many of them, that not all of it comes through.”</p>
    <p>While the PAP’s can­di­dates do not at­tract as much at­ten­tion be­cause the party has been in power for the liv­ing mem­ory of most Sin­ga­pore­ans, he said: “If peo­ple look at them, they will see pas­sion­ate young men and women who want to cre­ate a bet­ter Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>He also ac­knowl­edged the party needs to think about how to present its can­di­dates bet­ter so peo­ple know what they have done and their vi­sion for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Asked if the PAP was shift­ing its search for can­di­dates away from its tra­di­tional graz­ing grounds of the civil ser­vice and the mil­i­tary, he said the party’s un­der­ly­ing prin­ci­ple is to choose peo­ple it thinks can best serve res­i­dents, and “not start with pre­con­ceived ideas that mil­i­tary is bad or mil­i­tary is good, civil ser­vice is bad or civil ser­vice is good”.</p>
    <p>While talent has tra­di­tion­ally gone into the civil ser­vice and the mil­i­tary, to­day’s pri­vate sec­tor holds a sub­stan­tial talent pool too, and the PAP looks for peo­ple of qual­ity across dif­fer­ent sec­tors, said Mr Shan­mugam, who was a lawyer in pri­vate prac­tice be­fore he joined pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>“The es­sen­tials you look for are the same: the per­son, does he have en­ergy? Does he have the heart to serve? Is he will­ing? Is he ca­pa­ble?</p>
    <p>“Those ques­tions are fun­da­men­tal and they don’t change,” he said. “Where you find them, as so­ci­ety changes, you also have got to change the way you look for peo­ple, be­cause the peo­ple you bring in have got to fit the needs of a chang­ing pop­u­la­tion.”</p>
    <p>On the is­sue of po­lit­i­cal suc­ces­sion, he said the fourth-gen­er­a­tion lead­er­ship team has to forge its own way both in work­ing with a new gen­er­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans who have dif­fer­ent ex­pec­ta­tions from their par­ents and grand­par­ents, but also to emerge from un­der the shadow of “an ex­tremely for­mi­da­ble and pop­u­lar Prime Min­is­ter and two se­nior min­is­ters who have very large foot­prints”.</p>
    <p>In that sense, the chal­lenges they face are no dif­fer­ent from when the 2G team un­der Mr Goh Chok Tong was emerg­ing from the shad­ows of the “tow­er­ing gen­er­a­tion” that was the found­ing fa­thers, or when the 3G team un­der Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong had to emerge from their shad­ows.</p>
    <p>Yet, in the Sin­ga­pore style, each gen­er­a­tion as it emerges will be helped by the pre­vi­ous gen­er­a­tion of lead­ers, said Mr Shan­mugam.</p>
    <p>“It is, as we have in­di­cated, a work in progress started some time ago, and they have to both get the con­fi­dence of the pop­u­la­tion and a chang­ing elec­torate, and at the same time carve out their own roles and work with each other in a chang­ing in­ter­na­tional con­text with many new chal­lenges.”</p>
    <p>On whether GE2020 showed that young and first-time vot­ers want the PAP to move to­wards a more lib­eral and pop­ulist style of gov­er­nance, Mr Shan­mugam said he did not think that was the case.</p>
    <p>“They were, in my view, no dif­fer­ent from younger vot­ers of pre­vi­ous gen­er­a­tions – they want fair­ness, they want jus­tice, they want to feel that they are part of a sys­tem where peo­ple are able to ex­press them­selves, and they want good gov­er­nance and they want the party in govern­ment to pro­duce re­sults,” he said.</p>
    <p>“And, you know, it’s not an un­fair ex­pec­ta­tion.”</p>
