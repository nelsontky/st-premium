    <p>HAPPY DAYS IN SCHOOL:</p>
    <p>The Shang­hai Theatre Academy, which has pro­duced sev­eral well-known ac­tors in China, turned 75 on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Many of its fa­mous alumni wished their alma mater a happy an­niver­sary by post­ing on so­cial me­dia pho­tos of them­selves when they were study­ing in the pub­lic univer­sity, which is ded­i­cated to the dra­matic arts.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese ac­tress Li Bingbing (photo 1), from the class of 1993, posted two pho­tos of her­self, one in front of a wall with the school’s name (photo 2) and the other of her in a gar­den with a build­ing model.</p>
    <p>The 47-year-old, who has acted in movies such as The Mes­sage (2009), De­tec­tive Dee And The Mys­tery Of The Phan­tom Flame (2010) and Hol­ly­wood movie The Meg (2018), wrote: “I am proud to be an alum­nus of the Shang­hai Theatre Academy.”</p>
    <p>For­mer Chi­nese ac­tor Ren Quan (photo 3), who was from the same batch as Li, is equally proud to have grad­u­ated from the univer­sity.</p>
    <p>The 47-year-old, who is a busi­ness­man, posted a photo of him­self in a grad­u­a­tion gown (photo 4). He wrote: “Once a mem­ber of the academy, al­ways a mem­ber of the academy.”</p>
    <p>For Chi­nese celebrity cou­ple Lu Yi and Bao Lei (photo 5), from the class of 1995, their time at the univer­sity was prob­a­bly sweet as well (photo 6). They fell in love at the univer­sity and mar­ried in 2006. They have two daugh­ters.</p>
    <p>Lu, 44, who is most fa­mous for play­ing Chi­nese strate­gist Zhuge Liang in the tele­vi­sion series Three King­doms (2010), posted a photo that he and his wife took dur­ing their univer­sity days.</p>
    <p>Other alumni of the academy in­clude en­ter­tain­ers Tong Dawei, Feng Shaofeng, Xu Zheng,</p>
    <p>Hu Ge and Ma Yili.</p>
