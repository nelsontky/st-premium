    <p>Com­pa­nies have been urged to pro­vide high-qual­ity fi­nan­cial state­ments amid the pan­demic, fo­cus­ing on ar­eas like as­set val­u­a­tions and go­ing-con­cern as­sess­ments, to keep in­vestors well in­formed. In­terim fi­nan­cial re­ports for the pe­riod ended June 30 may be the first re­ports since Covid-19 took hold.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial state­ments should pro­vide com­pa­ra­ble and rel­e­vant in­for­ma­tion that ad­e­quately re­flects the im­pact of Covid-19 on the is­suer. Timely dis­clo­sure of any changed cir­cum­stances will en­able in­vestors to make an in­formed in­vest­ment ’’ de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>SGX REGCO CHIEF EX­EC­U­TIVE TAN BOON GIN AND LIST­ING COM­PLI­ANCE HEAD JUNE SIM, in a col­umn.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies have been urged to pro­vide high-qual­ity fi­nan­cial state­ments amid the pan­demic to keep in­vestors well in­formed, said the Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Au­thor­ity and Sin­ga­pore Ex­change Reg­u­la­tion (SGX RegCo).</p>
    <p>Firms should fo­cus on ar­eas like as­set val­u­a­tions and go­ing con­cern as­sess­ments when com­pil­ing th­ese re­ports, SGX RegCo noted in a col­umn.</p>
    <p>“The in­terim fi­nan­cial re­ports for the pe­riod ended June 30 may be the first re­ports since Covid-19 took hold and brought on var­i­ous chal­lenges and re­stric­tions,” it said.</p>
    <p>“Sig­nif­i­cant un­cer­tainty, or even threats to busi­ness prospects, have hit is­suers across var­i­ous sec­tors.</p>
    <p>“High-qual­ity fi­nan­cial state­ments, in­clud­ing in­terim re­ports, are fun­da­men­tal to the in­tegrity of Sin­ga­pore’s cap­i­tal mar­kets.”</p>
    <p>Sur­veys in April showed that com­pa­nies such as those in man­u­fac­tur­ing and ser­vices have a gloomy view of prospects for the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>SGX RegCo chief ex­ec­u­tive Tan Boon Gin and list­ing com­pli­ance head June Sim noted in the col­umn that such chal­lenges make it even more vi­tal that firms en­sure their in­terim re­ports are re­li­able.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies have to con­firm that to the best of their knowl­edge, noth­ing has come to the at­ten­tion of the board of direc­tors which may ren­der the in­terim fi­nan­cial state­ments false or mis­lead­ing in any ma­te­rial as­pect. “In pro­vid­ing the neg­a­tive as­sur­ance con­fir­ma­tion, boards should con­sider whether the in­terim fi­nan­cial state­ments pro­vide a bal­anced and fair view of any ma­te­rial fac­tors that have af­fected the is­suer’s busi­ness con­di­tions and fi­nan­cial po­si­tion, in­clud­ing the im­pact of Covid-19,” they added.</p>
    <p>Boards and man­age­ment should also care­fully as­sess if as­set val­ues are ap­pro­pri­ately re­ported in fi­nan­cial state­ments and re­view whether the pan­demic may have changed val­u­a­tions sig­nif­i­cantly. Th­ese as­pects should also be clearly ex­plained to in­vestors and com­pa­nies should dis­close key as­sump­tions used, such as for­ward-look­ing in­for­ma­tion on earn­ings growth rates.</p>
    <p>“We un­der­stand the present chal­lenges faced by is­suers in mak­ing sig­nif­i­cant judg­ments and es­ti­mates on as­set val­u­a­tion,” Mr Tan and Ms Sim said.</p>
    <p>“Boards should use best en­deav­ours to en­sure that the fair value of as­sets is not over­stated, and en­gage man­age­ment closely and ques­tion the ap­pro­pri­ate­ness of key as­sump­tions made in as­set val­u­a­tions.”</p>
    <p>If a com­pany has seen its busi­ness con­di­tions de­te­ri­o­rate, it should as­sess its abil­ity to op­er­ate as a go­ing con­cern and dis­close th­ese un­cer­tain­ties. That could also mean a re­quest for a trad­ing sus­pen­sion.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies also should avoid generic state­ments in their dis­clo­sures but be spe­cific, bal­anced and fair with­out omit­ting im­por­tant facts that might be un­favourable, they noted. In ad­di­tion, if firms use al­ter­na­tive per­for­mance mea­sures such as free cash flows, they should not mis­lead in­vestors but use them con­sis­tently be­tween pe­ri­ods with clear ex­pla­na­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan and Ms Sim noted: “Fi­nan­cial state­ments should pro­vide com­pa­ra­ble and rel­e­vant in­for­ma­tion that ad­e­quately re­flects the im­pact of Covid-19 on the is­suer.</p>
    <p>“Timely dis­clo­sure of any changed cir­cum­stances will en­able in­vestors to make an in­formed in­vest­ment de­ci­sion.”</p>
