    <p>All the world’s top ten­nis play­ers, in­clud­ing 20-time Grand Slam cham­pion Roger Fed­erer, are ex­pected to be in Mel­bourne for the coro­n­avirus-dis­rupted Aus­tralian Open, tour­na­ment di­rec­tor Craig Ti­ley has said.</p>
    <p>The open­ing Grand Slam of the year, in front of at least 50 per cent of nor­mal crowds, has been pushed back three weeks un­til Feb 8 with all play­ers to un­dergo a manda­tory 14-day quar­an­tine on ar­rival.</p>
    <p>The de­lay could be piv­otal for Fed­erer, who ad­mit­ted last week he was in a “race against time” to be fit as his re­cov­ery from two rounds of knee surgery takes longer than ex­pected.</p>
    <p>But Ti­ley said he had been in touch with the 39-year-old, re­veal­ing that he was go­ing through his nor­mal pre-sea­son train­ing rou­tine in Dubai. “Ev­ery player, in­clud­ing Roger, has made a commitment to travel to Mel­bourne to play,” he said af­ter con­firm­ing the new start date on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>“We have been in touch with him and his team and it’s been three days now, he’s hit for the first time in Dubai. He’s in his nor­mal pre­sea­son train­ing rou­tine.</p>
    <p>“He did say to us that Feb 8 was a more suit­able date for him in terms of pre­par­ing for the Aus­tralian Open.</p>
    <p>“But a lot will de­pend on how he re­sponds to his surgery in the next two to three weeks of train­ing.”</p>
    <p>Fed­erer has won the Aus­tralian Open six times.</p>
    <p>But af­ter los­ing in the semi-fi­nals in Jan­uary to world No. 1 No­vak Djokovic, the Swiss missed the rest of the Covid-in­ter­rupted sea­son fol­low­ing surgery and could only watch as Rafael Nadal matched his record of 20 Slam ti­tles with a 13th vic­tory at the French Open.</p>
    <p>The men’s and women’s qual­i­fiers will be held in Doha and Dubai re­spec­tively from Jan 10 to 13, with play­ers ar­riv­ing in Mel­bourne from Jan 15 on spe­cial char­tered flights for their quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Ti­ley added they would con­stantly be tested for Covid-19 but al­lowed to train for five hours a day in a bio-se­cure bub­ble, al­beit with just one other player.</p>
    <p>They will be shut­tled be­tween des­ig­nated ho­tels and Mel­bourne</p>
    <p>Park, where the tour­na­ment is held and if any­one tests pos­i­tive, they will need to self-iso­late in their room. “If there are any breaches (of quar­an­tine), the player will be im­me­di­ately re­moved from the coun­try as well as be­ing fined,” Ti­ley warned.</p>
    <p>A slimmed-down, 12-team ATP Cup, the re­lo­cated Ade­laide In­ter­na­tional, and a ATP 250 event will all be played in Mel­bourne once play­ers are out of iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Two WTA 500 tour­na­ments are also planned to be held con­cur­rently at Mel­bourne Park from</p>
    <p>Jan 31 to Feb 7.</p>
    <p>Mel­bourne only emerged from a months-long lock­down in Oc­to­ber fol­low­ing a sec­ond wave of Covid-19. This has com­pli­cated plan­ning for the hard-court event and prepa­ra­tions to al­low play­ers and sup­port staff to en­ter the coun­try, which was closed off to in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tors in March, safely.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has largely con­tained the coro­n­avirus although a new out­break in Syd­ney in re­cent days has sparked fresh re­stric­tions in parts of the city and state bor­der clo­sures.</p>
