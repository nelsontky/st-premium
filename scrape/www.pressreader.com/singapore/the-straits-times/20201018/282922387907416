    <p>Within days of China an­nounc­ing its first case of Covid-19, Viet­nam was mo­bil­is­ing to stop the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Us­ing mass texts, TV ads, bill­boards, posters and loud­speak­ers, the govern­ment ex­horted the na­tion’s 100 mil­lion ci­ti­zens to iden­tify car­ri­ers and trace con­tacts, con­tacts of con­tacts, even con­tacts of con­tacts of con­tacts. Rapid iso­la­tion of out­breaks has kept Viet­nam’s death rate among the low­est in the world – well un­der one death per mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Con­tain­ing the pan­demic al­lowed Viet­nam to quickly re­open busi­nesses, and it is now ex­pected to be the world’s fastest-grow­ing econ­omy this year.</p>
    <p>While many na­tions are suf­fer­ing enor­mous eco­nomic con­trac­tions and run­ning to the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund for fi­nan­cial res­cues, Viet­nam is grow­ing at a 3 per cent an­nual pace. Even more im­pres­sive, its growth is driven by a record trade sur­plus, de­spite the col­lapse in global trade.</p>
    <p>This break­out mo­ment for Viet­nam has been a long time in the mak­ing. Af­ter World War II, the “Asian mir­a­cles” – first Ja­pan, then Tai­wan and</p>
    <p>South Korea, most re­cently China – grew their way out of poverty by open­ing to trade and in­vest­ment and be­com­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing ex­port pow­er­houses.</p>
    <p>Now, Viet­nam is fol­low­ing the same path, but in an en­tirely new age. The con­di­tions that made the orig­i­nal mir­a­cles pos­si­ble are gone. The post-war baby boom is over. The era of rapid glob­al­i­sa­tion, with grow­ing trade and in­vest­ment flows, is over.</p>
    <p>In this en­vi­ron­ment, the su­per­pow­ers no longer ig­nore the tac­tics that the ear­lier mir­a­cles used to get an edge. Re­cently, the United States for­mally ac­cused Viet­nam of cur­rency ma­nip­u­la­tion and ini­ti­ated the same type of in­ves­ti­ga­tion that trig­gered the tar­iff war with China.</p>
    <p>An even big­ger threat to Viet­nam’s con­tin­u­ing growth is that the coun­try has been ruled for nearly half a cen­tury by the same au­thor­i­tar­ian party. With no op­po­si­tion, au­to­crats can force very rapid growth, but of­ten, their unchecked pol­icy whims and ob­ses­sions gen­er­ate er­ratic boom-and-bust cy­cles, which stall de­vel­op­ment. These hur­dles make what Viet­nam’s un­usu­ally com­pe­tent au­toc­racy has achieved so far all the more im­pres­sive – but also much more dif­fi­cult to sus­tain.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing their boom years, the orig­i­nal Asian mir­a­cles pro­duced an­nual ex­port growth close to 20 per cent – nearly dou­ble the av­er­age for low- or mid­dle-in­come na­tions at the time.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam has sus­tained a sim­i­lar pace for three decades. Even as global trade slumped in the 2010s, Viet­nam’s ex­ports grew 16 per cent a year, by far the fastest rate in the world, and three times the emerg­ing-world av­er­age.</p>
    <p>While other emerg­ing coun­tries spend heav­ily on so­cial wel­fare, to ap­pease vot­ers, Viet­nam de­votes its re­sources to its ex­ports, build­ing roads and ports to get goods over­seas, and schools to ed­u­cate work­ers.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment in­vests about 8 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) each year on new build­ing projects, and now gets higher grades for the qual­ity of its in­fra­struc­ture than any na­tion at a sim­i­lar stage of de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>It also steers for­eign­ers’ money in the same di­rec­tion. Over the last five years, for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment has av­er­aged more than 6 per cent of GDP in Viet­nam, the high­est rate of any emerg­ing coun­try. Most of it goes to build­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing plants and re­lated in­fra­struc­ture, and most of it now comes from fel­low Asian coun­tries, in­clud­ing South Korea, Ja­pan and China.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam has be­come a favourite des­ti­na­tion for ex­port man­u­fac­tur­ers leav­ing China in search of cheaper wages. Av­er­age an­nual per capita in­come in Viet­nam has quin­tu­pled since the late 1980s to nearly US$3,000 (S$4,075) per per­son, but the cost of labour is still one half that of China, and the work force is un­usu­ally well ed­u­cated for its in­come class.</p>
    <p>Tech sur­passed cloth­ing and tex­tiles as Viet­nam’s lead­ing ex­port in 2015, and ac­counts for most of its record trade sur­plus this year.</p>
    <p>In a pro­tec­tion­ist era, Viet­nam is also a trend-bend­ing, com­mu­nist cham­pion of open bor­ders, a sig­na­tory to more than a dozen free trade agree­ments – in­clud­ing a land­mark deal re­cently signed with the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>Can Viet­nam con­tinue its suc­cess, de­spite po­ten­tial ob­sta­cles such as shrink­ing pop­u­la­tions, de­clin­ing trade and an au­to­cratic govern­ment’s tena­cious grip on power? Prob­a­bly. While its own work­ing-age pop­u­la­tion growth is slow­ing, most Viet­namese still live in the coun­try­side, so the econ­omy can con­tinue to grow by shift­ing work­ers from ru­ral ar­eas to ur­ban fac­tory jobs.</p>
    <p>Over the last five years, no large coun­try has in­creased its share of global ex­ports more than Viet­nam has. And so far, its govern­ment has not made the kind of egre­gious pol­icy mis­take that typ­i­cally re­tards eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment in au­to­cratic na­tions. It is mak­ing au­to­cratic cap­i­tal­ism work un­usu­ally well, through open eco­nomic poli­cies and sound fi­nan­cial man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>The over­whelm­ing ma­jor­ity of post-war economies that grew su­per fast, or went bust, were run by au­thor­i­tar­ian gov­ern­ments. Viet­nam has sus­tained strong growth so far, largely free of the clas­sic ex­cesses, like large govern­ment deficits or pub­lic debts.</p>
    <p>One pos­si­ble prob­lem: Af­ter mul­ti­ple rounds of pri­vati­sa­tion, the govern­ment owns fewer com­pa­nies, but those it still owns are huge and ac­count for nearly a third of eco­nomic out­put – same as a decade ago. If trou­ble comes, these bloated state com­pa­nies, which ac­count for many of the bad loans in the bank­ing sys­tem, are one place it could start.</p>
    <p>Ris­ing debts also led to fi­nan­cial crises that marked the end of sus­tained growth in Ja­pan, South Korea and Tai­wan, and now hang over China as well.</p>
    <p>So there are per­ils on any de­vel­op­ment path. For now, Viet­nam looks like a mir­a­cle from a by­gone era, ex­port­ing its way to pros­per­ity.</p>
