    <p>WHERE 01-10, Block 658 Pung­gol East OPEN 11am to 2.30pm,</p>
    <p>4.30 to 11pm daily</p>
    <p>TEL 9026-1882</p>
    <p>Head chef Wong Kin Yang and his wife Chong Yee Ling, both 43, run the stall, which they started in Bukit Merah View in 2005.</p>
    <p>Be­tween 2007 and 2017, they opened five more out­lets, in­clud­ing an air-con­di­tioned restau­rant in Pung­gol Set­tle­ment and an eatery in Seran­goon Cen­tral. All have since closed.</p>
    <p>This out­let in Pung­gol East, which opened in Au­gust, is the only one re­main­ing.</p>
    <p>The stand­out dish here is Cut­tle­fish With Kangkong ($12). This dish alone is worth trav­el­ling the dis­tance. For­get all other ver­sions of cut­tle­fish with kangkong. Leong Ji’s ver­sion is a lay­ered tower of crisp good­ness.</p>
    <p>Topped with a gen­er­ous heap of crushed peanuts, the first layer com­prises crispy yam strips. The next layer is shred­ded green mango, fol­lowed by suc­cu­lent pieces of blanched cut­tle­fish in a spicy chilli sauce.</p>
    <p>Next are crunchy ji­cama strips, then the sur­prise: a bed of deep­fried kangkong cooked like tem­pura.</p>
    <p>The en­tire tower is driz­zled with a house­made ro­jak sauce made aro­matic with torch gin­ger bulb and Pe­nang prawn paste.</p>
    <p>The sauce – in­spired by the ro­jak in chef Wong’s home town in Ipoh – can give ro­jak hawk­ers here a run for their money.</p>
    <p>The Cai Pu Chicken ($9) is blanched kam­pung chicken smoth­ered with a top­ping of crisp, diced pre­served radish and a house­blended soya sauce. The chicken is skil­fully pre­pared and has a ten­der yet firm tex­ture.</p>
    <p>But the stel­lar part of the dish is the ac­com­pa­ny­ing tangy chilli dip made in-house with freshly hand­squeezed lime juice, gar­lic and shal­lots.</p>
    <p>A pop­u­lar dish among regulars is In­tes­tine With Dried Shrimp ($15), fea­tur­ing sang cheong, or pig fal­lop­ian tube, which is hard to find th­ese days. While the tex­ture of the sang cheong is crunchy, the gravy drowns the dish. I pre­fer a drier ver­sion.</p>
    <p>The flat rice noo­dles in the Curry Hor Fun ($6) are ex­pertly fried with a smoky wok aroma, but the curry is too wa­tery for my lik­ing.</p>
    <p>Sur­pris­ingly, the dish works bet­ter for take­away. The noo­dles ab­sorb the curry gravy and turn more flavour­some.</p>
