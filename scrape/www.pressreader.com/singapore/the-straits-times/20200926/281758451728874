    <p>It was April in New York, the cold grip of win­ter only slightly loos­en­ing in a stricken city of am­bu­lances rac­ing through de­serted streets and hos­pi­tal tents set up in Cen­tral Park. In late March and early April, nearly 1,700 peo­ple were be­ing hos­pi­talised daily, ac­cord­ing to New York City’s health depart­ment.</p>
    <p>One of those bat­tling on the front line of the ram­pag­ing pan­demic was Ms Sachiko Kiy­omi, a nurse on the night shift in a nurs­ing home, who one night that April was car­ry­ing a body down to the morgue when she was told that it was full, and she had to put it in a re­frig­er­a­tor truck.</p>
    <p>On the way she en­coun­tered the fam­ily of the de­ceased. The dead man’s son had been up­set and an­gry at first, curs­ing her on the phone, in­sist­ing that he had the right to see his fa­ther – some­thing he was pre­vented from do­ing by Covid-19 pro­to­cols. Now face to face, he apol­o­gised. She told him she un­der­stood, that she would have felt the same way.</p>
    <p>His fa­ther had been happy at the nurs­ing home, the son said. It was not as im­per­sonal as a hos­pi­tal. She and the fam­ily cried to­gether, she re­calls.</p>
    <p>Then she and a col­league con­tin­ued with the body on a stretcher, clam­ber­ing up a ramp into the chilly re­frig­er­a­tor truck, hold­ing a single lamp with a long cord which was the only way to see in­side. She was at the bot­tom end of the stretcher; at one point the weight of the body slid down against her stom­ach as they lugged it up­wards.</p>
    <p>“There were bod­ies on the floor of the truck,” she re­mem­bers. Be­cause there was no time, the prac­tice of at­tach­ing a tag with the per­son’s name on it on the body bag had been aban­doned.</p>
    <p>Now their names were writ­ten on a sheet of pa­per and stuck on the body bags. By the light of the lamp, she read them. “They were all peo­ple I knew,” she says. “I was cry­ing.”</p>
    <p>Shortly af­ter she went back to her floor, she was told an­other res­i­dent had died. Three res­i­dents died on her floor alone (there were oth­ers on other floors) within eight hours that night.</p>
    <p>Ms Kiy­omi, see­ing her­self as an awk­ward fit in Ja­pan, came to the United States when she was 18, to study fash­ion. That was 24 years ago. Even­tu­ally, she switched to study­ing to be a nurse.</p>
    <p>She is now an Amer­i­can ci­ti­zen, at 42 liv­ing in a nar­row, clut­tered apart­ment in East Har­lem, twice mar­ried and twice di­vorced, with four chil­dren – two boys and two girls – rang­ing from age four to 20. She is also a nurse who holds down two jobs, of­ten in­volv­ing night shifts, at the nurs­ing home and a hos­pi­tal – both of which she re­quested should re­main un­named.</p>
    <p>Ms Kiy­omi ra­di­ates warmth and pos­i­tive en­ergy. She has an in­fec­tious smile.</p>
    <p>In the tiny liv­ing room with a heavy-grain wooden ta­ble and a wash­ing ma­chine rum­bling to it­self in the at­tached kitchen, she cra­dled a lit­tle dog and re­mem­bered the night the three res­i­dents died of the coro­n­avirus. Two of her younger chil­dren wan­dered in and out of the room. Tacked on the win­dow of the chil­dren’s room is a sign in crayon colours: hearts, and the word “Love”.</p>
    <p>Ms Kiy­omi also lost three co­work­ers to the coro­n­avirus. One had been like a mother to her, she says. She worked the night shift at the nurs­ing home. She could man­age that even as the rest of the city ground to a halt, be­cause she was able to send her younger chil­dren to a spe­cial school set up specif­i­cally for the chil­dren of health­care work­ers so that they could con­tinue to work.</p>
    <p>“It was hell” at the nurs­ing home, she says. “It was worse than the re­ports in the me­dia.”</p>
    <p>One floor de­voted to de­men­tia pa­tients which was usu­ally a lively hive of ac­tiv­ity fell si­lent as res­i­dents were con­fined to their rooms, some of them be­com­ing ill as well.</p>
    <p>Nurs­ing homes are not equipped for pa­tients suf­fer­ing med­i­cal emer­gen­cies. She was the only fully qual­i­fied nurse; the rest were cer­ti­fied nurs­ing as­sis­tants. At one point they worked, sweat­ing in their pro­tec­tive gear, try­ing to re­vive a pa­tient.</p>
    <p>“Some­times the pulse came back and we were like oh my god,” she says.</p>
    <p>But it can hap­pen fleet­ingly when one is man­u­ally ma­nip­u­lat­ing the heart.</p>
    <p>“We gave it ev­ery­thing we could but af­ter 45 min­utes, we could not do any­thing more.”</p>
    <p>Amer­ica’s nurs­ing homes suf­fered mass ca­su­al­ties. The one in which Ms Kiy­omi works was not alone; ac­cord­ing to a New York Times data­base, across the na­tion at least 68,000 res­i­dents and work­ers have died of the coro­n­avirus at nurs­ing homes and other long-term care fa­cil­i­ties for older adults.</p>
    <p>The fa­cil­i­ties were over­whelmed; in many cases the staff did not have enough per­sonal pro­tec­tion equip­ment for them­selves and were grate­ful for do­na­tions from cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus is par­tic­u­larly lethal for older peo­ple with un­der­ly­ing health is­sues. Even though just 8 per cent of the coun­try’s cases have oc­curred in such long-term care fa­cil­i­ties, deaths re­lated to Covid-19 in th­ese fa­cil­i­ties have ac­counted for more than 41 per cent of the coun­try’s pan­demic fa­tal­i­ties, the New York Times re­ported.</p>
    <p>The US cur­rently leads the world in Covid-19 in­fec­tions and deaths, with nearly seven mil­lion cases and more than 200,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>There were days of cry­ing. But com­ing home to the chil­dren helped, Ms Kiy­omi says. She has a nanny at home – an 85-year-old Ja­panese woman who lived through World War II. This is noth­ing com­pared to then, she would say. “She’s the one you should in­ter­view, not me,” Ms Kiy­omi jokes.</p>
    <p>When I ask Ms Kiy­omi to sum up what her take­away is from hav­ing bat­tled in the nurs­ing home at the height of the pan­demic, she says in the greater scheme of things she finds a mes­sage of “new hope”.</p>
    <p>“New hope,” she re­peats. I ask her to ex­plain, and she says: “Be­cause be­fore this, we took so much for granted.”</p>
