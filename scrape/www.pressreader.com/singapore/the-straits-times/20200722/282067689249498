    <p>I re­fer to Mr Tan Ying San’s Fo­rum let­ter (Many people to­day un­aware of hard truths Singapore faces, July 20).</p>
    <p>I re­spect­fully dis­agree with his view.</p>
    <p>Young people in Singapore to­day may be even more aware of hard truths that are be­com­ing harder.</p>
    <p>They are lead­ing the dis­cus­sion on cli­mate change, gen­der equal­ity, race is­sues and eco­nomic equal­ity, among many other mat­ters.</p>
    <p>These are is­sues our found­ing lead­ers have faced be­fore. As ide­al­is­tic young people, these lead­ers forged their ideas in the West, through the Malayan Fo­rum. They im­pro­vised and adapted, lead­ing the pop­u­la­tion in build­ing Singapore into a thriv­ing city state.</p>
    <p>To­day’s young people are no dif­fer­ent. For this im­pos­si­ble na­tion to con­tinue suc­ceed­ing, they are dis­cussing the hard­est is­sues. The meth­ods may have changed, but the spirit re­mains the same.</p>
    <p>The re­sult of the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion shows that the Singapore spirit of the 1950s and 1960s re­mains very much alive. Young people of to­day con­tinue to as­pire to new heights and will not set­tle for less.</p>
    <p>What all Sin­ga­pore­ans must learn is to judge ideas on their mer­its, not on their ori­gins.</p>
    <p>Just as Amer­i­can ideas are not in­trin­si­cally better, so Sin­ga­porean ideas are not al­ways the right an­swer.</p>
    <p>A dis­cus­sion of rea­son­able solutions can hap­pen openly and re­spect­fully. This re­spect­ful dis­cus­sion can be­gin in Par­lia­ment, where the elected op­po­si­tion MPs will all come from the mod­er­ate Work­ers’ Party.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans should build bridges and con­sen­sus across di­vides, not dig trenches and take op­por­tunis­tic pot­shots based on iden­tity pol­i­tics, be it race, age, gen­der or po­lit­i­cal af­fil­i­a­tion.</p>
    <p>To that end, crit­i­cal think­ing and con­sen­sus build­ing should be built into our ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem and even in pub­lic dis­course</p>
    <p>Let us have dif­fi­cult con­ver­sa­tions based on re­spect and un­der­stand­ing, and not to fur­ther fear and dis­cord.</p>
    <p>Even as the econ­omy suf­fers amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, this cri­sis sets the stage for how we want to re­build our econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Klaus Sch­wab of the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum calls this The Great Re­set. We have the per­fect op­por­tu­nity to have these dif­fi­cult con­ver­sa­tions to build an even better Singapore.</p>
    <p>We should not squan­der it by judg­ing ideas based on their ori­gins.</p>
