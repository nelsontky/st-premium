    <p>Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo yes­ter­day de­fended the pas­sage of a con­tro­ver­sial job cre­ation law which has led to protests in a num­ber of cities across In­done­sia for three days.</p>
    <p>In his first pub­lic com­ments since the law was passed on Mon­day, Mr Joko, pop­u­larly known as Jokowi, said that it could help se­cure em­ploy­ment for the 2.9 mil­lion young peo­ple en­ter­ing the job mar­ket each year.</p>
    <p>He added that the law is also nec­es­sary as the Covid-19 pan­demic has af­fected 3.5 mil­lion work­ers and 6.9 mil­lion peo­ple are un­em­ployed.</p>
    <p>“The job cre­ation law aims to pro­vide as many jobs as pos­si­ble to job seek­ers and the un­em­ployed,” Mr Joko said in an ad­dress from the pres­i­den­tial palace in Bo­gor, West Java. The speech was live-streamed on YouTube and broad­cast by some tele­vi­sion sta­tions.</p>
    <p>More than 3,800 peo­ple – in­clud­ing stu­dents, work­ers and the un­em­ployed – were de­tained na­tion­wide dur­ing ral­lies this week that at times turned vi­o­lent, said na­tional po­lice spokesman Argo Yu­wono.</p>
    <p>The lo­cal me­dia re­ported that smaller protests took place yes­ter­day in sev­eral cities on Java and Su­ma­tra is­lands.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia’s econ­omy, South-east Asia’s largest, shrank by 5.32 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter com­pared with the same pe­riod last year, and the coun­try is ex­pected to fall into re­ces­sion for the first time in more than two decades.</p>
    <p>The “om­nibus” job cre­ation Bill re­vises 79 laws cov­er­ing a wide range of is­sues. One big con­tentious point for unions is that it re­duces manda­tory sev­er­ance pay from a max­i­mum of 32 times of a laid-off worker’s monthly salary to 19 times, with the gov­ern­ment pay­ing an ad­di­tional six months.</p>
    <p>Al­though a lot of the anger against the leg­is­la­tion has been di­rected at parts of the Bill af­fect­ing work­ers, the Pres­i­dent yes­ter­day noted that it would fa­cil­i­tate the set­ting up of mi­cro and small-scale en­ter­prises by In­done­sians.</p>
    <p>“Overlappin­g reg­u­la­tions and com­pli­cated pro­ce­dures are cut. Mi­cro, small and medium-sized en­ter­prises no longer need business per­mits. They only need to reg­is­ter. It’s very sim­ple,” he said.</p>
    <p>The law also scraps the min­i­mum</p>

    <p>amount of cap­i­tal needed to es­tab­lish a com­pany, and eases re­quire­ments to set up a co­op­er­a­tive as well.</p>
    <p>Mr Joko also un­der­lined that the law would sup­port ef­forts to pre­vent and erad­i­cate cor­rup­tion be­cause it would cut red tape and pro­mote an on­line li­cens­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>But the Pres­i­dent is fac­ing mount­ing pres­sure to re­peal the law as unions and Mus­lim groups pre­pare to chal­lenge it in court.</p>
    <p>Mr Said Iqbal, chair­man of the In­done­sian Worker Union Con­fed­er­a­tion, which was among the or­gan­is­ers of the three-day na­tion­wide strike that ended on Thurs­day, has said it was con­sid­er­ing whether to lodge a case in the Con­sti­tu­tional Court.</p>
    <p>“We have re­jected the law, and there­fore we also re­ject its de­riv­a­tive reg­u­la­tions,” he told The Straits Times on Thurs­day in re­sponse to a ques­tion about the pos­si­bil­ity of ne­go­ti­a­tions with the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia’s largest Mus­lim or­gan­i­sa­tion, Nahd­latul Ulama, has also pub­licly stated that it would chal­lenge the law in court.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, some re­gional lead­ers, in­clud­ing Jakarta Gov­er­nor Anies Baswedan, have said that they will pass on the views of those op­posed to the leg­is­la­tion to the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Dr Anies said he had met pro­test­ers, dis­cussed the mat­ter with them and promised to con­vey their mes­sage to the cen­tral gov­ern­ment, Reuters re­ported.</p>
    <p>The news agency also quoted West Kal­i­man­tan Gov­er­nor Su­tarmidji, who goes by one name, as say­ing in a state­ment that re­peal­ing the law would pre­vent fur­ther clashes “that could cre­ate pro­longed in­sta­bil­ity amid a pan­demic and an eco­nomic re­ces­sion”.</p>
