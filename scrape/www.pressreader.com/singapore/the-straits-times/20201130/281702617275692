    <p>LANDSHUT (Ger­many) • Chest­nuts roast­ing, mulled wine steam­ing and mu­sic blar­ing from wooden chalets lined with ar­ti­fi­cial snow – the Landshut Christ­mas mar­ket in southern Ger­many has all the usual trim­mings.</p>
    <p>But this year, vis­i­tors must en­joy the sights and smells of the tra­di­tional Christ­mas mar­ket from in­side their cars due to pre­cau­tions to pre­vent the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery night, sev­eral dozen ve­hi­cles roll into the Christ­mas mar­ket drive-in, their oc­cu­pants cosy and so­cially dis­tanced in­side.</p>
    <p>Once through the gates, they must wait for an em­ployee wear­ing a mask and a Christ­mas hat to knock on their win­dow and of­fer them a menu of savoury treats to choose from, such as crepes, sausages and roasted chest­nuts.</p>
    <p>Or­ders placed, they can then drive on to the next hut of­fer­ing sweets such as candy floss or ginger­bread hearts.</p>
    <p>“We take our in­spi­ra­tion from fast-food chains,” smiles Mr Pa­trick Sch­midt, 31, mar­ket or­gan­iser and owner of the Zoll­haus Landshut res­tau­rant.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to recre­ate a bit of the Christ­mas at­mos­phere, even if it’s more com­pli­cated this year.”</p>
    <p>The mar­ket is a way of help­ing his busi­ness get through “a dif­fi­cult time”, he said.</p>
    <p>As Ger­many bat­tles a sec­ond wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, leisure and sport­ing fa­cil­i­ties have been or­dered to close while restau­rants and bars can of­fer only take­aways.</p>
    <p>The re­stric­tions also in­clude lim­its on so­cial gath­er­ings and have been a huge blow to Ger­many’s 3,000 or so an­nual Christ­mas mar­kets.</p>
    <p>The mar­kets have been an an­nual fix­ture in the coun­try since the 15th cen­tury, when crafts­men and bak­ers were given spe­cial per­mis­sion to ply their wares in town squares in the run-up to Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>But many Ger­man cities have can­celled their Christ­mas mar­kets en­tirely this year, de­spite the huge fi­nan­cial losses – the mar­kets draw about 160 mil­lion vis­i­tors an­nu­ally and bring in rev­enues of €3 bil­lion (S$4.8 bil­lion) to €5 bil­lion, ac­cord­ing to the BSM stall-keep­ers’ in­dus­try associatio­n.</p>
    <p>To keep the spirit – and the eco­nomic ben­e­fits – of Christ­mas alive, cities across the coun­try have come up with cre­ative ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>In Ber­lin’ s Char­lot­ten­burg-Wilmers­dorf dis­trict, small clus­ters of huts have been spread across sev­eral streets, though food and drink can­not be con­sumed on-site.</p>
    <p>The world-fa­mous Nurem­berg Christ­mas mar­ket has been can­celled this year, but man­aged to hold an on­line ver­sion of its tra­di­tional open­ing cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>And in north-western Ger­many,</p>
    <p>the town of Kalkar is also of­fer­ing a drive-in Christ­mas mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The mar­ket in Landshut has been open since the mid­dle of this month and is prov­ing pop­u­lar with lo­cals, ac­cord­ing to Mr Sch­midt.</p>
    <p>He said there were 500 cars on Nov 21.</p>
    <p>And they are not just here for the mulled wine, served in ther­mos flasks to keep it warm – many are com­ing with the whole fam­ily in tow.</p>
    <p>“I’m here to sup­port the restau­rants, be­cause I miss them,” said Mr Markus Ren­neke, 55, vis­it­ing the mar­ket with his wife.</p>
    <p>“And I think it’s a great idea.” An­other vis­i­tor San­dra, joined by her teenage daugh­ter Laura, was here to en­joy that spe­cial Christ­mas mar­ket “at­mos­phere”.</p>
    <p>“You have to put a bit of time aside and there are no stands sell­ing any­thing but food, but that’s OK,” she said, as a wait­ress ar­rived with two grilled sausages.</p>
    <p>Her daugh­ter, “starv­ing”, could not re­sist start­ing to tuck into her sausage be­fore the fi­nal stop: the check­out.</p>
    <p>Once they have set­tled up, cus­tomers are free to re­turn home bask­ing in the glow of mulled wine – apart from the des­ig­nated driv­ers, of course.</p>
    <p>Ger­many, which kept in­fec­tions and deaths low com­pared with many of its neigh­bours in the first wave of the pan­demic, has stopped an ex­po­nen­tial rise in new coro­n­avirus cases but the over­all num­bers are still far too high, say of­fi­cials.</p>
