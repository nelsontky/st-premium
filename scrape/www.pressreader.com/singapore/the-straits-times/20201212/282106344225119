    <p>We thank Dr Tommy Wong Sai Wai and Mr Benny Tan for their feed­back on the TraceTo­gether To­ken dis­tri­bu­tion (Set up to­ken col­lec­tion booths at MRT sta­tions and malls; Unavail­abil­ity of to­kens hin­ders tar­get take-up rate, both Dec 10).</p>
    <p>Since pub­lic dis­tri­bu­tion of the TraceTo­gether to­kens be­gan, there has been high de­mand for them. To cater to this higher-than-ex­pected de­mand, we have adjusted our dis­tri­bu­tion model so that col­lec­tion is now stag­gered and re­stricted to res­i­dents in the con­stituency. This is to bet­ter match sup­ply with de­mand, as we ad­just pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>We will ex­pand to­ken col­lec­tion to more con­stituen­cies in the com­ing weeks.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, more than 60 per cent of Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents are on the TraceTo­gether pro­gramme, in­clud­ing those who have down­loaded and reg­is­tered for the app.</p>
    <p>We are heart­ened that there has been steady growth in adop­tion, driven by both to­ken col­lec­tion and app sign-ups.</p>
    <p>We’d like to en­cour­age those with a smartphone to down­load the app so that they can get on board the pro­gramme im­me­di­ately with­out wait­ing for the to­ken.</p>
    <p>More app down­loads will help drive adop­tion up faster, as we look for­ward to greater re­lax­ation of Covid-19 measures.</p>
    <p>We are con­tin­u­ally re­fin­ing the app to make it as power-ef­fi­cient as pos­si­ble. Cur­rent bat­tery con­sump­tion is only marginally greater with the app run­ning, par­tic­u­larly on phones that al­ready have Blue­tooth en­abled. Users are ad­vised to keep their apps up­dated to ben­e­fit from the lat­est en­hance­ments.</p>
    <p>Those who re­quire as­sis­tance with the app can ap­proach our Smart Na­tion Am­bas­sadors at the TraceTo­gether booths in shop­ping malls across Sin­ga­pore. They will help the pub­lic down­load and set up the app, and guide them on how to use the app to do SafeEn­try check-ins.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents who pre­fer the to­ken should visit the To­kenGoWhere web­site or look out for up­dates on com­mu­nity no­tice boards on the com­mence­ment of to­ken col­lec­tion in their re­spec­tive con­stituen­cies.</p>
    <p>We thank the pub­lic for the sup­port to­wards our con­tact trac­ing ef­forts, and we would like to as­sure ev­ery­one that TraceTo­gether-only SafeEn­try will be im­ple­mented only when ev­ery­one who wants a to­ken has had a chance to col­lect one.</p>
