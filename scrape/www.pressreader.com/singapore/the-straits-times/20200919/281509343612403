    <p>Sin­ga­pore eas­ily has more than 100,000 cars of­fer­ing point-to-point trans­port ser­vices – or roughly one-sixth of its en­tire car pop­u­la­tion. Com­mer­cial im­pli­ca­tions aside, this can­not be good for con­ges­tion, pol­lu­tion or Sin­ga­pore’s “car-lite” am­bi­tions. For-hire ve­hi­cles clock three to four times the mileage of reg­u­lar pas­sen­ger cars. All these can be tack­led, but it re­quires po­lit­i­cal will... If the au­thor­i­ties can tackle the is­sue of over­sup­ply, it will help the in­dus­try and the peo­ple work­ing in it far more ef­fec­tively. And the ben­e­fits will last far longer than any fi­nan­cial aid pack­age.</p>
    <p>This week, the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment an­nounced a $112 mil­lion fi­nan­cial aid pack­age for the taxi and pri­vate-hire in­dus­try – its third round of such aid since the Covid-19 pan­demic hit early this year.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, more than $300 mil­lion has been doled out.</p>
    <p>This sum is gen­er­ous com­pared what was handed out dur­ing the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome cri­sis, even tak­ing into ac­count the fact that the mar­ket has grown since the out­break in 2003.</p>
    <p>While public fi­nan­cial assistance is jus­ti­fied in dire sit­u­a­tions, it must be com­ple­mented by pri­vate-sec­tor ef­forts.</p>
    <p>In this case, the pri­vate sec­tor refers to the taxi and pri­vate-hire op­er­a­tors, the ride-hail­ing firms, and their share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>In fact, these par­ties must be seen to be do­ing more. Oth­er­wise, tax­pay­ers are sub­si­dis­ing their op­er­a­tions, di­rectly or in­di­rectly.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the latest tranche of in­dus­try-tar­geted aid, the Gov­ern­ment had al­ready paid out over $1.1 bil­lion to more than 190,000 self-em­ployed work­ers, in­clud­ing cab­bies and pri­vate-hire driv­ers.</p>
    <p>The amount was part of</p>
    <p>$193 bil­lion set aside to help busi­nesses pre­serve jobs and to aid the econ­omy, which was strug­gling with the ef­fects of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Hence the latest $112 mil­lion pack­age is sur­pris­ing – es­pe­cially when rid­er­ship has now re­turned to 70 per cent of pre-pan­demic lev­els (up from as low as 20 per cent in April and May dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker to stem the spread of Covid-19).</p>
    <p>It is also cu­ri­ous be­cause the com­pa­nies them­selves do not ap­pear to be shoul­der­ing the same weight. The Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) said taxi op­er­a­tors have pledged rental re­bates worth $29 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>What about pri­vate-hire and ride-hail­ing firms?</p>
    <p>But even as­sum­ing $29 mil­lion rep­re­sents the taxi op­er­a­tors’ share of the point-to-point trans­port mar­ket (16,000 ve­hi­cles ver­sus around 50,000 pri­vate-hire cars), it can be ar­gued that they should do more than tax­pay­ers.</p>
    <p>Why? Be­cause they are the di­rect ben­e­fi­cia­ries of com­merce that de­pends al­most ex­clu­sively on rental in­come paid by cab­bies.</p>
    <p>Yes, the com­pa­nies them­selves are bleed­ing (for now).</p>
    <p>But many have been highly prof­itable for a very long time.</p>
    <p>Bar­ring its first-ever loss for the six months ended June 30, taxi gi­ant Com­fortDelGro has been reap­ing tidy earn­ings from its taxi busi­ness since its for­ma­tion 17 years ago. And, de­spite its maiden half-year loss, it still has a healthy bal­ance sheet, with cash and equiv­a­lents ex­ceed­ing $600 mil­lion as at June this year.</p>
    <p>It must be noted though that Com­fortDelGro had waived rental com­pletely in April and May. It should be lauded for that.</p>
    <p>But, right now, in the light of the latest aid pack­age from tax­pay­ers, it can do more.</p>
    <p>It is of­fer­ing its cab­bies a 25 per cent rental re­bate. But even af­ter this re­bate, the rental for its Toy­ota Prius costs around $90 a day, ver­sus Trans-Cab’s $76.</p>
    <p>But at least the cab com­pa­nies are at­tempt­ing to match the $112 mil­lion gov­ern­ment aid pack­age – which is more than what the ride-hail­ing firms are do­ing.</p>
    <p>In fact, be­yond the first month of the cir­cuit breaker – which saw Go­jek waiv­ing rentals by up to 60 per cent and the com­mis­sion it charges by 100 per cent, and Grab grant­ing a 30 per cent rental waiver and a 50 per cent re­duc­tion in com­mis­sion – the ride-hail­ing firms have lagged be­hind the taxi firms in help­ing their driv­ers.</p>
    <p>Both Grab and Go­jek keep their fi­nan­cials close to their ch­est, but they do not seem to be short of in­vestor fund­ing. Ac­cord­ing to in­dus­try watch­ers, Grab is val­ued at US$14 bil­lion (S$19 bil­lion), while Go­jek is val­ued at US$10 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Grab has raised over US$8 bil­lion since it was formed in 2012 – enough to buy Com­fortDelGro three times over. And, ac­cord­ing to re­cent re­ports, China’s Alibaba Group is look­ing to in­vest US$3 bil­lion in the com­pany, which has a swanky of­fice in Ma­rina Bay.</p>
    <p>It should also be noted that Grab’s de­liv­ery busi­ness has seen a huge surge be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Hence, it is sur­pris­ing that it is not re­duc­ing the com­mis­sion that it charges driv­ers in the light of the latest gov­ern­ment assistance. The Gov­ern­ment’s main in­ten­tion may well be to pre­serve jobs, but there could be other ways to do this.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences trans­port econ­o­mist Wal­ter Th­e­seira sug­gests “a tax-neu­tral way which as­sists all par­ties” might be to ex­tend cer­tifi­cates of en­ti­tle­ment and scrap re­bate el­i­gi­bil­ity for un­hired ve­hi­cles. This, he says, re­duces the op­er­a­tors’ de­pre­ci­a­tion ex­penses.</p>
    <p>But en­sur­ing that op­er­a­tors pass on the sav­ings to driv­ers may be tricky.</p>
    <p>Still, fi­nan­cial hand­outs, in any form, are Band-Aids at best.</p>
    <p>In the case of the taxi and pri­vate-hire in­dus­try, sys­temic re­form is needed for its long-term sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>This week, the LTA an­nounced that new pri­vate-hire driv­ers must be at least 30 years old and must be Sin­ga­pore ci­ti­zens.</p>
    <p>It is a long-awaited move to level the play­ing field for taxi and pri­vate-hire op­er­a­tors, but more can be done.</p>
    <p>The most glar­ing is­sue which bur­dens the in­dus­try is its over­sup­ply of ve­hi­cles. Un­like taxi op­er­a­tors, pri­vate-hire firms are not gov­erned by fleet-size caps. There are now around 16,000 taxis ver­sus 50,000 pri­vate-hire cars here.</p>
    <p>On top of that, there are at least as many “hitch” cars – an in­dus­try catch-all for ve­hi­cles that claim to of­fer car­pool­ing ser­vices, but, in re­al­ity, breach car­pool­ing rules and com­pete with the li­censed op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>And, since their costs are lower (lower or no com­mis­sions, no com­mer­cial in­surance cov­er­age), they charge lower fares.</p>
    <p>In­clud­ing these, Sin­ga­pore eas­ily has more than 100,000 cars of­fer­ing point-to-point trans­port ser­vices – or roughly one-sixth of its en­tire car pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Com­mer­cial im­pli­ca­tions aside, this can­not be good for con­ges­tion, pol­lu­tion or Sin­ga­pore’s “car-lite” am­bi­tions. For-hire ve­hi­cles clock three to four times the mileage of reg­u­lar pas­sen­ger cars.</p>
    <p>All these can be tack­led, but it re­quires po­lit­i­cal will.</p>
    <p>While job preser­va­tion may be deemed oblig­a­tory now, it does lit­tle to en­sure the long-term em­ploy­a­bil­ity of driv­ers.</p>
    <p>In fact, in an over-in­flated sec­tor, con­tin­ued fi­nan­cial aid may also de­lay a nat­u­ral re­siz­ing of the in­dus­try. Driv­ers who drop out can then be per­suaded to drive buses, which in turn will re­duce our re­liance on for­eign driv­ers.</p>
    <p>If the au­thor­i­ties can tackle the is­sue of over­sup­ply, it will help the in­dus­try and the peo­ple work­ing in it far more ef­fec­tively.</p>
    <p>And the ben­e­fits will last far longer than any fi­nan­cial aid pack­age.</p>
    <p>As Mr Neo Nam Heng, chair­man of di­ver­si­fied mo­tor group Prime, says: “In­stead of giv­ing us fish, give us a fish­ing net.”</p>
    <p>He adds: “We need long-term so­lu­tions.”</p>
