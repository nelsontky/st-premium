    <p>The emer­gency al­lows the govern­ment to en­force manda­tory quar­an­tines and stream­line dis­ease-con­trol plans with­out mul­ti­ple ap­provals from var­i­ous agen­cies, ac­cord­ing to Gen­eral Natthapol Nak­panich, deputy army chief and deputy leader of the na­tional Covid-19 task force.</p>
    <p>BANGKOK • Thai­land is con­sid­er­ing an ex­ten­sion of its state of emer­gency to Sept 30 to pre­vent a se­cond wave of coro­n­avirus cases, as it re­ports its first Covid-19 case out­side the state quar­an­tine area after al­most three months with­out a lo­cal in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The one-month ex­ten­sion, when ap­proved by the Cabi­net, would be the fifth since the ini­tial or­der in March.</p>
    <p>The emer­gency al­lows the govern­ment to en­force manda­tory quar­an­tines and stream­line dis­ease-con­trol plans with­out mul­ti­ple ap­provals from var­i­ous agen­cies, ac­cord­ing to Gen­eral Natthapol Nak­panich, deputy army chief and deputy leader of the na­tional</p>
    <p>Covid-19 task force.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials are wary as the virus reemerged re­cently in places in­clud­ing Viet­nam and New Zealand. Also, a stu­dent-led protest move­ment sweep­ing Thai­land could make it dif­fi­cult to con­trol spread­ing if an out­break oc­curs.</p>
    <p>“The worry is that many peo­ple will be too com­pla­cent after see­ing no new cases in the coun­try for many days,” Gen Natthapol said, adding that the ex­ten­sion of emer­gency rules will help the au­thor­i­ties to con­trol risks but will not af­fect peo­ples’ daily lives or their right to protest.</p>
    <p>A crowd of more than 10,000 peo­ple held a demon­stra­tion in Bangkok on Sun­day, one of the largest protests in re­cent years, to de­mand an end to Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha’s mil­i­tary-led ad­min­is­tra­tion and call for the monar­chy’s pow­ers to be reined in.</p>
    <p>While most pro­test­ers wear masks, they do not fol­low phys­i­cal-dis­tanc­ing prac­tices.</p>
    <p>But health of­fi­cials said they are pre­par­ing for a pos­si­ble se­cond wave and draft­ing ac­tion plans.</p>
    <p>Thai­land has de­tected 3,382 in­fec­tions so far, with new cases in re­cent weeks found in peo­ple al­ready in state quar­an­tine after re­turn­ing from abroad.</p>
    <p>Break­ing a streak of more than 80 days with­out any new cases from com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion de­tected, a Thai re­turnee from Dubai, who spent 14 days in state quar­an­tine be­fore be­ing re­leased, re­turned with symp­toms yes­ter­day, said the Fac­ulty of Medicine Ra­math­i­bodi Hospi­tal in Bangkok.</p>
    <p>“The de­tec­tion of new lo­cal cases won’t be a shock or a sur­prise. It could hap­pen,” said Dr Ta­narak Pli­pat, deputy head of the dis­ease con­trol depart­ment at the Health Min­istry. “The fo­cus will be on avoid­ing a large out­break in the coun­try.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Su­pat­tanapong Pun­meechaow said yes­ter­day that Thai­land will in­tro­duce more stim­u­lus mea­sures to boost tourism, jobs and con­sump­tion hit hard by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>South-east Asia’s se­cond-largest econ­omy suf­fered its big­gest con­trac­tion since the 1998 Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis in the se­cond quar­ter as the pan­demic put the brakes on vi­tal tourism and do­mes­tic ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>With bor­ders closed to for­eign vis­i­tors since April, the govern­ment plans more in­cen­tives to spur lo­cal tourism and add more jobs, while other mea­sures will be de­cided later, Mr Su­pat­tanapong told a brief­ing. The tourism and em­ploy­ment perks are ex­pected to be put to Cabi­net for ap­proval next week, he said.</p>
