    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The ice axe that was plunged into Rus­sian rev­o­lu­tion­ary Leon Trot­sky’s skull dur­ing his grue­some mur­der in Mex­ico on Aug 20, 1940, is to­day among the prized ex­hibits at Wash­ing­ton’s In­ter­na­tional Spy Mu­seum.</p>
    <p>It took Mr Keith Mel­ton, an es­pi­onage his­to­rian for the United States Cen­tral In­tel­li­gence Agency, nearly four decades to find it – as well as to fig­ure out why Ra­mon Mer­cader, the as­sas­sin sent by then Soviet Union leader Joseph Stalin, used the axe to kill Trot­sky.</p>
    <p>Mr Mel­ton, who combed the world to amass the col­lec­tion of in­ge­nious and macabre tools of the black arts of spy­ing that fill the mu­seum, had his eye on find­ing the weapon since the 1970s.</p>
    <p>It had dis­ap­peared shortly after the as­sas­si­na­tion. Fol­low­ing clues from Mex­ico to Moscow and coun­tries in be­tween, Mr Mel­ton re­peat­edly came up empty-handed.</p>
    <p>“I like de­tec­tive hunts. This re­ally is one that chal­lenged me,” he said.</p>
    <p>As he searched, he also fo­cused on a mys­tery: Why choose an ice axe?</p>
    <p>An ex­pe­ri­enced moun­taineer, Mer­cader was handy with the tool, also known as a pi­o­let.</p>
    <p>But just shoot­ing the 60-year-old rev­o­lu­tion­ary would have been eas­ier, after sev­eral failed at­tempts crafted by the Rus­sian NKVD, or se­cret po­lice.</p>
    <p>Trot­sky was the founder of the Red Army and, along with Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin, one of the prime movers i n the Bol­she­vik re­volt that over­threw Czar Ni­cholas II in Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>After fall­ing out with Stalin in the 1920s, Trot­sky was forced into ex­ile and even­tu­ally granted asy­lum in Mex­ico.</p>
    <p>He never left his small com­pound in Mex­ico City, pro­tected by a hand­ful of armed guards.</p>
    <p>But Mer­cader gained en­try to the rev­o­lu­tion­ary’s small en­tourage as the lover of a New York Trot­skyite, who be­lieved he was a left-lean­ing son of a wealthy Bel­gian diplo­mat – a cover de­signed by the NKVD.</p>
    <p>After mov­ing to the Mex­i­can cap­i­tal, over time, Mer­cader could en­ter and leave the com­pound with­out be­ing searched.</p>
    <p>Shoot­ing Trot­sky was one op­tion, but it risked noise that could make es­cap­ing dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>Then, weeks be­fore the planned act, Mr Mel­ton says, Trot­sky in­stalled a new metal gate at the en­try con­trolled by an elec­tric switch in the guard booth.</p>
    <p>That meant Mer­cader would have to kill Trot­sky qui­etly and in­stan­ta­neously with the ice axe’s jagged pick, so that he could walk out, the guards un­sus­pect­ing.</p>
    <p>“I had a rare abil­ity to han­dle the pi­o­let, since two blows were suf­fi­cient for me to crack through an enor­mous block of ice,” Mer­cader told the po­lice after­wards.</p>
    <p>Where to get one in Mex­ico, though? As it turns out, the son of the owner of Mer­cader’s res­i­dence had one, so he stole it.</p>
    <p>Mer­cader cut the long han­dle down by half and en­tered the com­pound on the day of the at­tack hid­ing it – along with a back-up pis­tol and knife – un­der a rain­coat.</p>
    <p>It did not go as planned.</p>
    <p>The axe went 7cm deep into Trot­sky’s skull but did not im­me­di­ately kill him. The vic­tim shouted and strug­gled, the guards were alerted and Mer­cader was cap­tured.</p>
    <p>Trot­sky died in hospi­tal the next day. And, after be­ing dis­played at a po­lice press con­fer­ence, the grisly weapon dis­ap­peared.</p>
    <p>Over the years, Mr Mel­ton saw numer­ous axes pur­ported to be the orig­i­nal, in­clud­ing one on dis­play in a Prague mu­seum.</p>
    <p>But none were the right brand or model, from the Aus­trian maker Werk­gen Fulpmes.</p>
    <p>BLOODY FIN­GER­PRINT</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, in 2005, Ms Ana Ali­cia Salas, daugh­ter of a for­mer Mex­i­can po­lice of­fi­cer, re­vealed she had kept the axe un­der her bed for years.</p>
    <p>It matched per­fectly and Mr Mel­ton even­tu­ally bought it for his col­lec­tion – he will not say for how much.</p>
    <p>One more piece was cru­cial to the puzzle – the po­lice ev­i­dence pic­tures from 1940 showed a bloody fin­ger­print on the weapon.</p>
    <p>Work­ing with a top foren­sic sci­en­tist from the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion, Mr Mel­ton said: “We were able to de­ter­mine there are the rem­nants of the bloody fin­ger­print still on the axe.”</p>
    <p>“The con­tour of the pat­tern matches per­fectly with the fin­ger­print shown in the photo,” he added.</p>
