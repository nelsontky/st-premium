    <p>Busi­nesses in Tai­wan that are seen as China-friendly face the risk of be­ing snubbed by lo­cals. Here are some ex­am­ples:</p>
    <p>1 WANT WANT GROUPOWNED BUSI­NESSES SUCH AS THE CHINA TIMES AND CTI NEWS, AND SNACKS</p>
    <p>The boy­cott be­gan in 2012 when chair­man Tsai Eng­meng told The Wash­ing­ton Post that the Tianan­men protests on June 4, 1989, did not end in a mas­sacre and “not that many peo­ple died”.</p>
    <p>For­mer Tianan­men stu­dent ac­tivist leader Wang Dan posted on Face­book, call­ing for the pub­lic to boy­cott Mr Tsai’s busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>His call was echoed by some Tai­wanese democ­racy ac­tivists and pub­lish­ers, and sup­ported by many Tai­wanese who vowed not to buy the pop­u­lar Want Want rice crack­ers.</p>
    <p>2 17 BUB­BLE TEA FRAN­CHISES, IN­CLUD­ING TRUEDAN, GONG CHA, CHATIME AND YI FANG</p>
    <p>They were listed by nu­mer­ous ne­ti­zens last year on so­cial me­dia sites, in­clud­ing Face­book and PTT, the largest ter­mi­nal­based bul­letin board sys­tem in Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>Be­hind the cam­paign were mainly younger Tai­wanese who shared posts on which fran­chises to stop pa­tro­n­is­ing.</p>
    <p>The shops were tar­geted af­ter they posted press state­ments that re­ferred to Tai­wan as “Tai­wan, China” or ex­pressed views that put China in a favourable light.</p>
    <p>3 WU PAO CHUN BAKERIES</p>
    <p>Award-win­ning baker Wu Pao-chun was crit­i­cised when he said he was born in “Tai­wan, China” and was “proud of be­ing Chi­nese” in a press state­ment re­leased in De­cem­ber 2018, shortly af­ter his first bak­ery in China opened.</p>
    <p>4 NEWS OUT­LETS WITH CHINA-FRIENDLY VIEWS</p>
