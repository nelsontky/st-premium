    <p>Ms An­tonella Car­bonaro, a con­sul­tant to fi­nan­cial tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies, saved up to buy her Birkin bag, a lux­ury tote made by Her­mès that sells new for tens of thou­sands of US dol­lars. Since get­ting her bag in 2018, Ms Car­bonaro has stored it in her closet, bring­ing it out only on spe­cial oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>But when she heard that there was a mar­ket­place to buy shares in other Birkins, in­clud­ing more ex­otic ver­sions that can fetch six fig­ures, she was in.</p>
    <p>Ms Car­bonaro, 30, sees her shares in an ex­clu­sive bag as an al­ter­na­tive in­vest­ment, no dif­fer­ent than stakes in pri­vate eq­uity funds that in­vest in a bas­ket of com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>“This is a vis­ual way to par­tic­i­pate in dif­fer­ent as­set classes that aren’t as ac­ces­si­ble. In­vest­ing in shares of Birkin bags, even though I have one, is get­ting more ex­po­sure.”</p>
    <p>She bought 10 shares in a Bleu Lézard Birkin bag that was val­ued at US$61,500 (S$84,000) in an of­fer­ing last year. Ear­lier this year, she bought 25 shares in a grey Hi­malaya Birkin. It was val­ued at US$140,000 in an of­fer­ing in May.</p>
    <p>Un­like own­ing a frac­tional share of a con­do­minium, she will never be able to use her in­vest­ment. Shares are traded un­til the owner of the mar­ket­place sells the as­set.</p>
    <p>Her first Birkin in­vest­ment is trad­ing up 6 per cent from the pur­chase price on Rally Rd, a plat­form that deals in frac­tional in­vest­ments in col­lectible items.</p>
    <p>The other one is still in the lockup pe­riod and its shares can­not be traded yet.</p>
    <p>The mar­ket for in­vest­ing in frac­tions of items oth­er­wise seen as col­lectibles has seen an uptick in in­ter­est dur­ing the pan­demic as peo­ple spend more time at home.</p>
    <p>Rally Rd be­gan by selling shares in ex­otic cars sev­eral years ago but has ex­panded to art, books, wine and whisky, mem­o­ra­bilia and Birkin bags.</p>
    <p>“In the beginning, it was like eq­uity mar­kets: just safe, blue-chip in­vest­ments,” said Mr Rob Petrozzo, a founder and the chief prod­uct of­fi­cer at Rally Rd.</p>
    <p>“Over the past few months, we’ve seen with peo­ple be­ing in­side, they’ve got­ten ac­cess to more in­for­ma­tion and they have been ex­plor­ing the app more fully.”</p>
    <p>He said ex­ist­ing in­vestors on the plat­form had dou­bled the num­ber of items they owned shares in. Ini­tial of­fer­ings have sold out five times faster than be­fore the pan­demic, as new in­vestors on the plat­form be­gan buy­ing up shares more quickly.</p>
    <p>The frac­tional move­ment is not lim­ited to lux­ury items. Fidelity, the mu­tual fund gi­ant, of­fers “stocks by the slice” where you can buy a por­tion of a share start­ing at US$1. And many pri­vate eq­uity funds, which have high min­i­mum in­vest­ments and long lockup pe­ri­ods, have cre­ated mu­tual fund ver­sions of their funds.</p>
    <p>Com­pound­ing the risk, an as­set typ­i­cally bought for per­sonal en­joy­ment or brag­ging rights can­not be an­a­lysed the same way that a pri­vate eq­uity in­vest­ment would be.</p>
    <p>“There could be re­turn po­ten­tial, but who knows?” said Mr Jack Ablin, chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer of</p>
    <p>Cres­set Cap­i­tal. “There’s no liq­uid­ity and no con­trol. When do you get your money back? You don’t know. The other is the car­ry­ing costs could be high.”</p>
    <p>Another i ssue is that buy­ing these as­sets in slices can mean a per­son is pay­ing more than she or he might if the per­son could buy the whole as­set, and that could dam­pen re­turns or make it hard to re­sell the as­set.</p>
    <p>As with other al­ter­na­tive in­vest­ments, buy­ers are re­stricted from the selling of these frac­tions un­til after the lockup pe­riod ends. But when the as­set it­self – the bag or the horse – is sold is de­ter­mined by the plat­form, not the in­di­vid­ual in­vestors.</p>
    <p>Mr Jimmy Lee, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Wealth Con­sult­ing Group, a wealth ad­viser, ques­tions the no­tion of buy­ing a pas­sion as­set with an eye to­wards profit. “When it comes to art, you only see the ones that go up in value,” he said. “If some­one buys a piece of art for US$1 mil­lion and it doesn’t go up in value, it’s not go­ing to be sold.”</p>
    <p>There are other draw­backs. These mar­ket­places do of­fer the pos­si­bil­ity of a re­turn on the in­vest­ment, but they de­prive peo­ple of the joy of own­ing a paint­ing or a fast car: hav­ing it in your pos­ses­sion. “You lose the in­ti­macy of what it’s meant to be,” Mr Ablin said. “It’s nor­mally an as­set you can touch, en­joy, ride in, ride on or drink.”</p>
    <p>But many in­vestors in shares seem un­both­ered by this.</p>
    <p>Ms Car­bonaro said not be­ing able to touch or hold the bags she had in­vested in was not an is­sue for her. “If I had a (US bas­ket­ball le­gend) Michael Jor­dan rookie card, I don’t think I’d want to touch it,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mr John Cochran, who works in sales in Bal­ti­more, has in­vested in shares of 76 dif­fer­ent col­lectibles in­clud­ing a shirt Michael Jor­dan wore i n a bas­ket­ball game, a Muham­mad Ali fight con­tract, a por­trait of Abra­ham Lin­coln and a 2006 Fer­rari f430 man­ual.</p>
    <p>He said he was happy re­ceiv­ing a photo and some in­for­ma­tion on the ob­ject and was un­fazed that he could not hold or touch it. “I like the idea that, just like my stocks, it’s all in an elec­tronic port­fo­lio,” he said. “I don’t have to have the re­sources to store these things.”</p>
    <p>The mar­ket for in­vest­ing in frac­tions of items oth­er­wise seen as col­lectibles has seen an uptick in in­ter­est dur­ing the pan­demic as peo­ple spend more time at home. Rally Rd be­gan by selling shares in ex­otic cars sev­eral years ago but has ex­panded to art, books, wine and whiskey, mem­o­ra­bilia and Birkin bags.</p>
