    <p>All ho­tel staff in con­tact with peo­ple serv­ing stay-home no­tice (SHN) will now be placed on a ros­tered rou­tine test­ing regime, where they will be tested for Covid-19 ev­ery two weeks, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Do­ing so will pro­vide an ad­di­tional layer of safe­guards in ho­tels which are used as SHN fa­cil­i­ties, said Mr Wong, not­ing that a re­cent in­ci­dent at the Man­darin Or­chard Sin­ga­pore ho­tel has high­lighted how the risk of Covid-19 trans­mis­sion re­mains de­spite safety mea­sures that have been put in place.</p>
    <p>In a min­is­te­rial state­ment, he said the au­thor­i­ties had not iden­ti­fied breaches in SHN pro­to­cols in the in­ci­dent at the ho­tel, based on pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>But the in­ves­ti­ga­tions sug­gest that in­fec­tion preven­tion pro­to­cols can be im­proved, such as through bet­ter crowd reg­u­la­tion, as well as hav­ing good ven­ti­la­tion sys­tems to cir­cu­late more fresh air.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to work closely with all SHN ho­tels to en­sure that in­fec­tion preven­tion pro­to­cols are ro­bust.”</p>
    <p>On Dec 19, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) an­nounced that it was prob­ing 13 cases of Covid-19 among peo­ple who had served their SHN at Man­darin Or­chard Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Pub­lic Health Lab­o­ra­tory (NPHL), which con­ducts whole genome se­quenc­ing and phy­lo­ge­netic anal­y­sis on all Covid-19 cases, found that the 13 im­ported cases – who were con­firmed to be in­fected in early Novem­ber last year – were in­fected by coro­n­avirus strains that have high ge­netic sim­i­lar­ity.</p>
    <p>This was de­spite the guests fly­ing in from dif­fer­ent coun­tries, im­ply­ing that the i nfec­tions may have come from one source.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, MOH said it had con­cluded its in­ves­ti­ga­tions into the 13 cases and found there was no trans­mis­sion beyond them, and that other Covid-19 cases who served the SHN at the ho­tel were not linked to those 13.</p>
    <p>No staff tested pos­i­tive through poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) tests, though 11 had pos­i­tive serol­ogy test re­sults, in­di­cat­ing that they were in­fected in the past.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong GRC) asked if MOH will con­sider es­tab­lish­ing ca­pa­bil­ity for scaled-up rapid whole genome se­quenc­ing of the virus from clin­i­cal sam­ples, in­clud­ing nose swabs, so as to com­ple­ment ex­ist­ing genome se­quenc­ing done on cul­tured virus.</p>
    <p>It cur­rently takes about four weeks to cul­ture the virus and com­plete the genome se­quenc­ing.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Mr Wong said that this is an es­tab­lished ca­pa­bil­ity within the NPHL and, where pos­si­ble, whole genome se­quenc­ing can be per­formed rapidly and di­rectly on clin­i­cal sam­ples of Covid-19pos­i­tive cases.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in sam­ples that have low vi­ral loads, it may be nec­es­sary for the virus to be cul­tured be­fore the se­quenc­ing can be run, he said.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to as­sess avail­able and emerg­ing lab­o­ra­tory tech­nolo­gies so we can im­prove our ca­pa­bil­i­ties and en­hance our re­sponses.”</p>
