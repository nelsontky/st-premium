    <p>BANGKOK • Thai po­lice used wa­ter can­non against pro­test­ers in Bangkok once more yes­ter­day as thou­sands marched to the Grand Palace, rais­ing ten­sions in a king­dom in­creas­ingly riven by con­flict over the role of its monar­chy.</p>
    <p>The young pro­test­ers, who have been stag­ing flash mobs all over the coun­try since Jan­uary, said they wanted to de­liver let­ters of de­mand to King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn.</p>
    <p>“We are march­ing to hand our let­ters to the King, to talk about our dif­fi­cul­ties and our suf­fer­ing,” 25-year-old Pat­sar­avalee “Mind” Tanakitvib­ulpon, one of the lead­ers, told the crowd. “Our three de­mands re­main the same.”</p>
    <p>They hauled along bright red mock mail­boxes where peo­ple were en­cour­aged to stuff their in­di­vid­ual let­ters. They also held aloft a gi­ant mock-up of an en­ve­lope, ad­dressed sim­ply to “Va­ji­ra­longkorn”.</p>
    <p>In a let­ter re­leased to the press and ad­dressed to the King, they said: “When you hear all the flat­ter­ing praise from the peo­ple, you must also hear fear­less crit­i­cisms and sug­ges­tions all the same. When the King truly cher­ishes democ­racy, all peo­ple will find hap­pi­ness. The three de­mands from the peo­ple are the ut­most com­pro­mise.”</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers want Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha to re­sign, the mil­i­tary-backed Con­sti­tu­tion to be amended, and the monar­chy to be reformed.</p>
    <p>The last de­mand is the most con­tentious, given that 68-year-old King Va­ji­ra­longkorn has taken con­trol of two army units and per­sonal own­er­ship of the multi­bil­lion-dol­lar crown as­sets since he as­cended the throne in 2016. While he keeps a home in Ger­many and spends much of his time there, he is cur­rently on an ex­tended so­journ in Thai­land.</p>
    <p>Demon­stra­tors want to trim his pow­ers in keep­ing with Thai­land’s sta­tus as a con­sti­tu­tional monar­chy. They also want him to rein in his spend­ing, in view of the coun­try’s Covid-19-in­duced eco­nomic hard­ship.</p>
    <p>The protests have l asted for months and sus­tained their mo­men­tum de­spite the ar­rests of key lead­ers, mor­ph­ing into a fluid “lead­er­less” move­ment which swiftly mo­bilises crowds via so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Roy­al­ists have re­sponded by ral­ly­ing sup­port­ers to gather while wear­ing yel­low to demon­strate fealty to the King.</p>
    <p>In an ap­par­ent charm of­fen­sive, the palace has re­laxed its strict pro­to­col to al­low peo­ple to get closer to the King. In the past few weeks, he has waded through ador­ing crowds out­side the palace with Queen Suthida, prais­ing key roy­al­ist lead­ers face to face and pos­ing for self­ies.</p>
    <p>On Nov 1, he even gave a sur­prise in­ter­view to a Bri­tish jour­nal­ist from Chan­nel 4. Asked what he thought about the pro­test­ers, he said: “We love them all the same.”</p>
    <p>Asked if there was any room for com­pro­mise, he replied: “Thai­land is the land of com­pro­mise.”</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers have since latched onto the King’s words and ap­pealed to him to treat them with the same courtesy he treats roy­al­ists.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day marked the sec­ond time po­lice turned wa­ter can­non on pro­test­ers. Their first use on Oct 16 sparked so much out­rage that Mr Prayut was even­tu­ally pres­sured to lift a state of se­ri­ous emer­gency in Bangkok in or­der to lower ten­sions.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to ad­vo­cacy group Thai Lawyers for Hu­man Rights, at least 173 peo­ple have been ar­rested this year for their in­volve­ment in the protests.</p>
    <p>Ms Pat­sar­avalee has been charged with sedi­tion for a protest out­side the Ger­man em­bassy on Oct 26, when protest lead­ers de­liv­ered a let­ter ap­peal­ing to Ber­lin to probe if the King con­ducted pol­i­tics from Ger­man soil – which the Ger­man For­eign Min­is­ter had ear­lier said was not al­lowed.</p>
