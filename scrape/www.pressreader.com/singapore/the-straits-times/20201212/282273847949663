    <p>The High Court has granted an ap­pli­ca­tion from DBS Bank to wind up Novena Global Health­care, which owes the bank more than $14 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>DBS’ lawyers told the court yes­ter­day that Novena Global Health­care had not been in touch with it and it would pro­ceed to wind up the com­pany.</p>
    <p>No one from the com­pany at­tended the hear­ing, but its sub­sidiary Novu Fas­thet­ics said last night that the wind­ing-up or­der “will not af­fect the day-to-day op­er­a­tions of Novu”.</p>
    <p>“Notwith­stand­ing the cor­po­rate and le­gal is­sues fac­ing our par­ent com­pany, it is busi­ness as usual at all our six out­lets in Sin­ga­pore,” said Ms Mar­jory Loh, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of Novu Fas­thet­ics, which op­er­ates its aes­thet­ics clin­ics un­der the Novu Aes­thet­ics trade name.</p>
    <p>RSM, which has been ap­pointed as the liq­uida­tor, told The Straits Times that the wind­ing-up or­der re­lates only to Novena Global Health­care and not other en­ti­ties or sub­sidiaries.</p>
    <p>It also noted that the present man­age­ment teams of the com­pany’s sub­sidiaries, in­clud­ing Novu Fas­thet­ics, re­main in charge of day-to-day op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate state­ment, Mr Ter­ence Loh, who co-founded Novena Global Health­care with cousin Nel­son Loh, said: “There are par­ties which have ex­pressed in­ter­est to ac­quire the Novu busi­ness, con­sid­er­ing its track record and growth po­ten­tial. In fact, some have al­ready be­gun con­duct­ing due dili­gence.”</p>
    <p>Novu Aes­thet­ics, for­merly known as PPP Laser, was founded by Dr Goh Seng Heng in 2010 and op­er­ated un­der a com­pany called Aes­thetic Med­i­cal Part­ners. The Loh cousins later be­came di­rec­tors, and fol­low­ing dis­putes with share­hold­ers, Dr Goh quit in 2016. PPP Laser was re­branded that year.</p>
    <p>The Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Author­ity (Acra) con­firmed last month that Aes­thetic Med­i­cal Part­ners was one of eight en­ti­ties owned by the Loh cousins that had not filed an­nual re­turns. En­force­ment ac­tion is un­der way.</p>
    <p>Novena Global Health­care was ear­lier found to have breached Acra reg­u­la­tions by fail­ing to file its an­nual re­turn. Fur­ther en­force­ment ac­tion has been taken against the com­pany, said Acra.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Novena Global Health­care Group, the par­ent firm of Novena Global Health­care which was incorporat­ed in the Cay­man Is­lands by the Loh cousins, has been un­der po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tion for al­legedly us­ing unau­tho­rised sig­na­tures of ac­count­ing firm Ernst & Young in fi­nan­cial state­ments. It also owes mil­lions of dol­lars to Citibank, United Over­seas Bank, May­bank and Stan­dard Char­tered Bank.</p>
    <p>The Loh cousins made news in Au­gust with a £280 mil­lion (S$493 mil­lion) takeover bid for English Premier League foot­ball club New­cas­tle United. The bid was made un­der the Bel­la­graph Nova Group, which they founded with Chi­nese entreprene­ur Evan­ge­line Shen in July.</p>
    <p>Mr Nel­son Loh later trans­ferred all his shares in Novena Global Health­care Group and all its units to Mr Ter­ence Loh for $1.</p>
    <p>Mr Ter­ence Loh told share­hold­ers last month that he “firmly be­lieves” the po­ten­tial liq­ui­da­tion of the Sin­ga­pore sub­sidiary “may not nec­es­sar­ily re­sult in the demise” of the par­ent com­pany.</p>
    <p>He also said Mr Nel­son Loh had left Sin­ga­pore. The Straits Times un­der­stands from sources that Mr Nel­son Loh is in China.</p>
