    <p>De­spite deep cuts in the lat­est quar­terly earn­ings of Sin­ga­pore-listed com­pa­nies and trusts, the worst is now be­hind them, DBS Group Re­search said in a mar­ket strat­egy report. In­vestor in­ter­est is likely to pick up for travel or leisure stocks, lifted by progress in Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­dates that are un­der tri­als, noted DBS an­a­lysts Yeo Kee Yan and Jan­ice Chua.</p>
    <p>While the ex­act time­line for a vac­cine to be made widely avail­able is un­cer­tain, DBS thinks the re­cov­ery in air travel will be swift once this ma­te­ri­alises. The an­a­lysts pointed to em­pir­i­cal ev­i­dence show­ing that China’s do­mes­tic air travel had re­cov­ered promptly to near pre-Covid-19 lev­els in a pre-vac­cine en­vi­ron­ment within five months.</p>
    <p>DBS thus rec­om­mends in­vestors... ac­cu­mu­late travel and leisure-re­lated stocks in an­tic­i­pa­tion of the in­dus­try pos­si­bly re­cov­er­ing next year.</p>
    <p>De­spite deep cuts in the lat­est quar­terly earn­ings of Sin­ga­pore-listed com­pa­nies and trusts, the worst is now be­hind them, said DBS Group Re­search in a mar­ket strat­egy report yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond-quar­ter re­sults sea­son had re­flected the im­pact of global Covid-19 lock­downs, with a sharp 14.9 per cent cut in forecast earn­ings for the cur­rent fi­nan­cial year. This ap­plies to stocks un­der DBS’ cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>In­vestor in­ter­est is likely to pick up for travel or leisure stocks, lifted by progress in Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­dates that are un­der tri­als, noted DBS an­a­lysts Yeo Kee Yan and Jan­ice Chua. DBS’ picks are Hutchi­son Port Hold­ings Trust (HPH Trust), ST Engi­neer­ing, SIA Engi­neer­ing Co (SIAEC), Wil­mar In­ter­na­tional, UMS and Ven­ture Corp. These are among the coun­ters with ei­ther a pos­i­tive earn­ings re­vi­sion of more than 5 per cent or a rec­om­men­da­tion upgrade.</p>
    <p>“Look­ing be­yond the ashes of the Q2 earn­ings slash, we seek op­por­tu­ni­ties from the list of com­pa­nies that saw up­ward earn­ings re­vi­sions or rec­om­men­da­tion up­grades,” Mr Yeo and Ms Chua said. These are com­pa­nies that have emerged pos­i­tively from the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>While the ex­act time­line for a vac­cine to be made widely avail­able is un­cer­tain, DBS thinks the re­cov­ery in air travel will be swift once it ma­te­ri­alises. The an­a­lysts pointed to em­pir­i­cal ev­i­dence show­ing that China’s do­mes­tic air travel had re­cov­ered promptly to near pre-Covid-19 lev­els in a pre-vac­cine en­vi­ron­ment within five months.</p>
    <p>DBS thus rec­om­mends in­vestors look be­yond the near term, to ac­cu­mu­late travel and leisure-re­lated stocks in an­tic­i­pa­tion of the in­dus­try pos­si­bly re­cov­er­ing next year.</p>
    <p>Its picks in the travel and leisure space are SIAEC, China Avi­a­tion Oil, Com­fort­Del­Gro Corp, As­cott Res­i­dence Trust and Far East Hospi­tal­ity Trust.</p>
    <p>As for man­u­fac­tur­ing and trade, DBS noted the strengthen­ing pur­chas­ing man­agers’ in­dices in the US and China, as well as the trans­porta­tion stocks’ strong run-up from the third quar­ter. These hint at a broad­en­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing re­cov­ery and a re­vival in trade ac­tiv­i­ties, said Mr Yeo and Ms Chua.</p>
    <p>DBS’ picks in these ar­eas are semi</p>
    <p>con­duc­tor com­po­nents maker UMS Hold­ings, cap­i­tal and con­sumer equip­ment ser­vice provider Frencken Group, and Ven­ture Corp, which pro­vides con­tract man­u­fac­tur­ing services to elec­tronic com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>DBS also favours HPH Trust, which the re­search team sees as a proxy to im­prov­ing global trade ac­tiv­ity, of­fer­ing a yield of about 11 per cent. The main­board-listed Chi­nese ship­builder Yangz­i­jiang Ship­build­ing has also seen im­prov­ing or­der flow and at­trac­tive val­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, May­bank Kim Eng has raised its tar­get for the bench­mark Straits Times In­dex (STI) to 2,995, from 2,200 pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>The higher STI tar­get im­plies a 17.9 per cent up­side, the bro­ker­age said in a report last Fri­day, adding that its eq­uity strat­egy calls for a bal­ance be­tween de­fence and growth, by weight­ing to­wards stocks with struc­tural growth, div­i­dend vis­i­bil­ity and di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>May­bank Kim Eng also noted that fears of a worst-case sce­nario seemed to have “over­shot lock</p>
    <p>down re­al­ity, with less earn­ings misses and higher earn­ings per share (EPS) up­grades” in the sec­ond quar­ter re­sults sea­son.</p>
    <p>“De­spite the worst of re­gional lock­downs in Q2, only 29 per cent of com­bined STI and May­bank KE cov­er­age stocks missed Street ex­pec­ta­tions,” its an­a­lysts wrote.</p>
    <p>DBS yes­ter­day main­tained its year-end tar­get for the STI at 2,850, with tech­ni­cal sup­port at 2,440.</p>
    <p>The STI cur­rently has a 12-month price-to-earn­ings ra­tio of about 13 times, and a price-to-book ra­tio of 0.84 times.</p>
    <p>In the sec­ond quar­ter of this year, five stocks dis­ap­pointed for ev­ery three stocks that beat ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>The main cul­prits be­hind the mar­ket’s sec­ond-quar­ter earn­ings drag were travel and leisure plays such as Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore Air­lines, as well as telco Sing­tel, along with a one-off cut for prop­erty de­vel­op­ers Cap­i­taLand, UOL and City Devel­op­ments Lim­ited, DBS said.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, tech stocks such as UMS, Frencken and Hi-P In­ter­na­tional, as well as health­care coun­ters, saw their earn­ings re­vised up­wards.</p>
    <p>The STI’s forecast earn­ings per share con­trac­tion has deep­ened to 36.1 per cent for this fi­nan­cial year.</p>
    <p>That said, there will be an equally sharp jump of 35.4 per cent for FY2021 EPS, boosted by the an­tic­i­pated 5.5 per cent re­cov­ery in gross do­mes­tic prod­uct on a low-base ef­fect, the an­a­lysts wrote.</p>
