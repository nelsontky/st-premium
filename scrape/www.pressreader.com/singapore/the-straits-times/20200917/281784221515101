    <p>SHANG­HAI • China is in­oc­u­lat­ing tens of thou­sands of its cit­i­zens with ex­per­i­men­tal coro­n­avirus vac­cines and at­tract­ing in­ter­na­tional in­ter­est in their devel­op­ment, despite ex­pert con­cerns over the safety of drugs that have not com­pleted stan­dard test­ing.</p>
    <p>China launched a vac­cine emer­gency use pro­gramme i n July, of­fer­ing three ex­per­i­men­tal shots de­vel­oped by a unit of state phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal gi­ant China Na­tional Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Group (Sinopharm) and US-listed Si­no­vac Biotech.</p>
    <p>A fourth one be­ing de­vel­oped by CanSino Bi­o­log­ics was ap­proved for use by the Chi­nese mil­i­tary in June.</p>
    <p>Aim­ing to pro­tect es­sen­tial work­ers and re­duce the like­li­hood of a resur­gence, the vac­cines are grab­bing at­ten­tion in the global scram­ble by coun­tries to se­cure sup­plies.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has not re­leased of­fi­cial data on the up­take in do­mes­tic tar</p>
    <p>geted groups, which in­clude med­i­cal, trans­port and food mar­ket work­ers.</p>
    <p>But China Na­tional Biotec Group (CNBG), the Sinopharm unit de­vel­op­ing two of the emer­gency use vac­cines, and Si­no­vac have con­firmed that at least tens of thou­sands of peo­ple have been in­oc­u­lated.</p>
    <p>CNBG said it had given hun­dreds of thou­sands of doses – one of its vac­cines re­quires two or three shots for an in­di­vid­ual to be in­oc­u­lated.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has en­gaged a pub­lic, top­down ap­proach to en­dorse the ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cines and foster com­mu­nity sup­port. Among those lin­ing up for shots early on were the chief ex­ec­u­tives of Si­no­vac and Sinopharm and the mil­i­tary’s re­search chief.</p>
    <p>The chief biosafety ex­pert at the Chi­nese Cen­tre for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion re­vealed this week that she also had been in­jected in April as she an­nounced the poten</p>
    <p>tial that at least some of the vac­cines would be ready for pub­lic use as early as Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>“So far, among the peo­ple who were vac­ci­nated, no one has been sick with the dis­ease,” Ms Wu Guizhen said on state TV. “So far, (the vac­ci­na­tion scheme) works very well. No side ef­fect oc­curred.”</p>
    <p>Her com­ments were broadly in line with com­ments by CNBG last week that none of the tens of thou­sands of peo­ple who trav­elled to high-risk coun­tries and re­gions after be­ing vac­ci­nated had been in­fected, and there was “no case of ob­vi­ous ad­verse re­ac­tion”.</p>
    <p>China’s ap­proach runs counter to that of many Western coun­tries, where ex­perts have warned against au­tho­ris­ing the emer­gency use of vac­cines that have not com­pleted test­ing, cit­ing a lack of un­der­stand­ing about longer-term ef­fi­cacy and po­ten­tial side ef­fects.</p>
    <p>Dr Anna Durbin, a vac­cine re­searcher at Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity, de­scribed China’s emer­gency use pro­gramme as “very prob­lem­atic”, say­ing it was im­pos­si­ble to judge ef­fi­cacy with­out a clin­i­cal trial stan­dard con­trol group.</p>
    <p>“You’re vac­ci­nat­ing peo­ple and you don’t know if it’s go­ing to pro­tect them,” Dr Durbin said, adding that re­cip­i­ents of the ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cines could es­chew other pro­tec­tive mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Vac­cine safety came into sharp fo­cus last week when As­traZeneca paused late-stage clin­i­cal tri­als of its Covid-19 vac­cine, one of the most ad­vanced in devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>The com­pany re­sumed Bri­tish tri­als over the week­end after re­ceiv­ing the green light from safety watch­dogs, and, along with other lead­ing Western vac­cine mak­ers, has pledged to up­hold sci­en­tific study stan­dards and re­ject any po­lit­i­cal pres­sure to rush the process.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia is one of the few coun­tries to au­tho­rise the use of an ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cine, mak­ing its own Sput­nik-V vac­cine manda­tory for some groups such as teach­ers.</p>
    <p>In­dia is also con­sid­er­ing emer­gency au­tho­ri­sa­tion for a vac­cine, par­tic­u­larly for the el­derly and peo­ple in high-risk work­places.</p>
