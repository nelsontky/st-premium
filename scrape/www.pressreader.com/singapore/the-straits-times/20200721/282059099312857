    <p>Mr Leong Mun Wai and Ms Hazel Poa – the two cho­sen by the Progress Sin­ga­pore Party (PSP) to take up their Non-Con­stituency MP slots – have stepped down from lead­er­ship po­si­tions in the party to fo­cus on their par­lia­men­tary du­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong, 60, was the as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the party, while Ms Poa, 49, was the vicechair­man. Both were in the five­mem­ber West Coast GRC slate led by party chief Tan Cheng Bock that lost to the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party team at the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The move was an­nounced to PSP mem­bers on Sun­day, in a mes­sage from or­gan­is­ing sec­re­tary Michael Chua. In his mes­sage, seen by The Straits Times, Mr Chua told mem­bers that the cen­tral ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee (CEC) de­cided dur­ing a meet­ing last Fri­day for Mr Leong and Ms Poa to be “relieved of in­ter­nal party re­spon­si­bil­i­ties so that they can fo­cus on their par­lia­men­tary du­ties as NCMPs”.</p>
    <p>“As such, they will step down from their posts as asst sec-gen and vice-chair­man re­spec­tively with im­me­di­ate ef­fect. A par­lia­men­tary sec­re­tariat will be set up to as­sist the NCMPs in their du­ties,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Mr Fran­cis Yuen will take over as asst sec-gen with im­me­di­ate ef­fect while the post of vice-chair­man will re­main va­cant for now,” said Mr Chua in his mes­sage.</p>
    <p>Mr Yuen, 70, a CEC mem­ber, rep­re­sented the PSP at the tele­vised de­bate dur­ing the cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Mr Chua said the new as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral will be plan­ning a re­struc­tur­ing of the party, to po­si­tion it for the fu­ture and be­gin the process of in­duct­ing younger mem­bers into roles of re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>“The re­struc­tur­ing will in­clude the set­ting up of a women’s wing and youth wing,” said Mr Chua, adding that a con­sul­ta­tive meet­ing will be held to dis­cuss the pro­posed new struc­ture with in­ter­ested mem­bers, be­fore im­ple­men­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>An of­fi­cial an­nounce­ment is set to be made by the party af­ter the Reg­istry of So­ci­eties has ap­proved the change, ST un­der­stands. This would take about two weeks.</p>
    <p>The reshuf­fle, which ef­fec­tively re­moves the party’s only two par­lia­men­tar­i­ans from the top jobs in the party, is un­con­ven­tional.</p>
    <p>Other op­po­si­tion par­ties have of­ten given their NCMPs larger roles in the party. The Work­ers’ Party’s three NCMPs af­ter the 2015 elec­tion – Mr Den­nis Tan, Mr Leon Per­era and Dr Daniel Goh – all held party lead­er­ship po­si­tions. And all three were given added re­spon­si­bil­i­ties in a lead­er­ship reshuf­fle in 2018.</p>
    <p>ST un­der­stands that PSP’s Dr Tan was the one who pro­posed sep­a­rat­ing party and par­lia­men­tary re­spon­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted, Mr Yuen told ST that the two NCMPs will re­main party lead­ers be­cause they re­main in the CEC.</p>
    <p>“They are still CEC mem­bers, they just don’t have a role that boxes them in day-to-day. We want to get it right for our first two NCMPs, so they need to spend all their time there, and step down from in­ter­nal as­sign­ments. We don’t want them dis­tracted with things like in­ter­view­ing new mem­bers and set­ting up ground op­er­a­tions.”</p>
