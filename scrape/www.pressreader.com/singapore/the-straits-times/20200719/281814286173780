    <p>Vet­eran diplo­mat Tony Ke­mal Sid­dique died on Fri­day night of a heart at­tack.</p>
    <p>He was 80, and was most re­cently Plenipo­ten­tiary Rep­re­sen­ta­tive to the Caribbean Com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Mr Sid­dique leaves be­hind his wife Sharon, their daugh­ters Sophia and Samira, and two grand­daugh­ters, Misha and Roxy.</p>
    <p>He pre­vi­ously served as Spe­cial En­voy for Arc­tic Af­fairs, and was Sin­ga­pore’s am­bas­sador to a host of Euro­pean coun­tries, in­clud­ing Fin­land, Hun­gary, Italy, Nor­way, Swe­den and Greece.</p>
    <p>Af­ter re­tir­ing from the civil ser­vice in 1996, he went into the pri­vate sec­tor and founded a strate­gic ad­vi­sory firm, where he was ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­la­hari Kausikan, chair­man of the Mid­dle East In­sti­tute, re­mem­bers Mr Sid­dique as a “leg­endary for­eign ser­vice of­fi­cer” and an “op­er­a­tor par ex­cel­lence”, from whom a gen­er­a­tion of diplo­mats learnt their craft.</p>
    <p>For­mer pres­i­dent SR Nathan – who was then per­ma­nent sec­re­tary for for­eign af­fairs – would ap­point Mr Sid­dique when he “needed the i mp o s s i b l e done”, said Mr Kausikan.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Mr Sid­dique was key to rais­ing the Cam­bo­dia vote at the United Na­tions (UN) in the crit­i­cal first years of the 1980s af­ter Viet­nam’s in­va­sion, said Mr Kausikan, for­mer per­ma­nent sec­re­tary for for­eign af­fairs from 2010 to 2013.</p>
    <p>Mr Sid­dique suc­ceeded in lob­by­ing for the coali­tion gov­ern­ment of Demo­cratic Kam­puchea to re­tain Cam­bo­dia’s UN seat, even though the odds were stacked against him.</p>
    <p>“In the 2000s, he sin­gle-hand­edly got us observer sta­tus in the Arc­tic Council,” he added. Singa</p>
    <p>HE DE­LIV­ERS</p>
    <p>You could send Tony into very dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tions and he can ex­tri­cate him­self and come out ’’ un­scathed. He de­liv­ers. PRO­FES­SOR CHAN HENG CHEE, who is Am­bas­sador-at-Large, on the vet­eran diplo­mat’s tal­ent.</p>
    <p>pore is the only small is­land observer state in the Arc­tic Council.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Chan Heng Chee, who is also Am­bas­sador-at-Large, said: “You could send Tony into very dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tions and he can ex­tri­cate him­self and come out un­scathed. He de­liv­ers.”</p>
    <p>Many of Mr Sid­dique’s col­leagues also re­mem­ber him for his ex­tra­or­di­nary tal­ent at net­work­ing.</p>
    <p>Vet­eran diplo­mat Vergh­ese Mathews, who was Sin­ga­pore’s for­mer Non-Res­i­dent High Com­mis­sioner to the Repub­lic of Fiji, said: “Tony was a larger-than-life per­son­al­ity. When­ever he was present, he would in­vari­ably be the cen­tre of at­ten­tion and lead the con­ver­sa­tion.”</p>
    <p>Mr Sid­dique was also gen­er­ous with younger diplo­mats, show­ing them the ropes on how to write po­lit­i­cal briefs and in­ter­act with their for­eign coun­ter­parts, said Am­bas­sador-at-Large Ong Keng Yong.</p>
    <p>“He taught us how there will al­ways be pri­vate chit-chat and deal mak­ing on the side­lines, and we must al­ways stay alert to counter those moves,” said Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>Mr Sid­dique was buried at the Choa Chu Kang Mus­lim Cemetery yes­ter­day af­ter­noon.</p>
