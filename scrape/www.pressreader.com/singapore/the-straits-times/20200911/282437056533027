    <p>Au­gust has turned into Septem­ber with a vengeance, bring­ing blis­ter­ing heat and ac­ti­vat­ing sweat glands I did not even know I had.</p>
    <p>Keep your rou­tine and base light, and beat the hu­mid­ity with these beauty favourites. •</p>
    <p>This ar­ti­cle in­cludes af­fil­i­ate links. When you buy through af­fil­i­ate links, we may earn a small com­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>SHISEIDO GLOBAL SUNCARE THE PER­FECT PRO­TEC­TOR, $65</p>
    <p>Shiseido’s cult sun­screen has been my go-to for SPF the last few hot and sweaty weeks. It boasts a patented WetForce Tech­nol­ogy, which re­in­forces UV pro­tec­tion when in con­tact with wa­ter (read: wa­ter-re­sis­tant), and a new HeatForce Tech­nol­ogy that sup­pos­edly does the same when in con­tact with heat.</p>
    <p>I can­not speak for the sci­ence of it, but the for­mula is a beau­ti­fully thin, milky liq­uid that is light­weight and com­fort­able for ex­tra sunny days, giv­ing some peace of mind for trips to the beach or pool.</p>
    <p>The thin­ner con­sis­tency is also ideal if I have to wear a mask and an added layer of make-up. It lay­ers well with other prod­ucts, with no pilling.</p>
    <p>It could even work alone – the slight pink­ish hue gives a “tone-up” ef­fect that bright­ens the com­plex­ion in­stantly. The pow­dery, semi-matte fin­ish means you are free from that tacky feel­ing that gives sun­screen its un­favourable rep­u­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Avail­able at Sephora, Metro, Robin­sons and Shiseido stores and bit.ly/SepSPer­fectP</p>
    <p>SUISAI BEAUTY CLEAR JELLY CLEANS­ING, $36</p>
    <p>Any beauty ex­pert will tell you that a thor­ough dou­ble cleanse is the most im­por­tant step in sk­in­care – es­pe­cially now, with mask-wear­ing bring­ing a higher risk of clogged pores.</p>
    <p>I typ­i­cally favour an oil cleanser as my first step, but less so lately now that I al­ready feel oily. In­stead, I have been reach­ing for this rinse-off make-up re­mover from Ja­panese brand Suisai.</p>
    <p>Seem­ingly wa­ter-based, it has a jelly tex­ture that re­moves all make-up with­out strip­ping the skin. Glyc­erin – a mois­tur­is­ing agent – re­tains the skin’s nat­u­ral mois­ture, leav­ing it feel­ing re­freshed and plump af­ter rins­ing off with wa­ter.</p>
    <p>I like that it is waste-free too as it does not re­quire cot­ton or bam­boo rounds to ap­ply. Scoop the jelly out with dry fin­gers and work it into the skin. Plus, a lit­tle bit goes a long way. With each scoop barely mak­ing a dent in the mys­te­ri­ous jelly, this mas­sive 240g tub will last you a de­cent amount of time.</p>
    <p>Avail­able at se­lected Don Don Donki and Wat­sons stores and bit.ly/LazSui­saiBCJC HOUR­GLASS UN­LOCKED IN­STANT EX­TEN­SIONS MAS­CARA, $49</p>
    <p>Few things grip my heart like a good wa­ter­proof mas­cara.</p>
    <p>Many have tried and failed against my ex­ces­sively oily eye­lids, which re­duce even the bold­est claims of “wa­ter­proof” and “smudge-proof” into streaky panda eyes in a mat­ter of hours.</p>
    <p>Af­ter months of ro­tat­ing the same three tried-and-true mas­caras, this new re­lease from Cal­i­for­nia-based Hour­glass Cos­met­ics has won a spot in my Mas­cara Hall of Fame.</p>
    <p>It is a tub­ing mas­cara, mean­ing it wraps in­di­vid­ual lashes in wa­ter-re­sis­tant, “tube-like” poly­mers, un­like reg­u­lar mas­caras that coat lashes in pig­ment. The re­sult: a hardy prod­uct that does not smudge yet comes off eas­ily with just wa­ter.</p>
    <p>This lifts and length­ens lashes to make them in­stantly ob­vi­ous. It is not the most vo­lu­mis­ing op­tion around, but that makes it ver­sa­tile enough to layer with your favourites, or use on its own at home, when you are scram­bling to look put to­gether for that umpteenth video call.</p>
    <p>Avail­able at Tangs and Sephora stores and bit.ly/SepHIES HERA AIRY BLUR PRIM­ING POW­DER, $72</p>
    <p>Pow­der­ing on-the-go just feels dif­fer­ent when you are deal­ing with a mask. You can end up look­ing more cakey than usual, with un­wanted pow­der con­cen­trat­ing in un­even patches around your mask.</p>
    <p>South Korean brand Hera has de­vised quite a novel for­mula that is timely for this new nor­mal.</p>
    <p>Un­like reg­u­lar pow­ders that set your make-up as the fi­nal step, this one is meant to be ap­plied af­ter your sk­in­care and be­fore base make-up – re­plac­ing a tra­di­tional primer that pro­longs make-up wear and holds ev­ery­thing in place.</p>
    <p>Aside from its in­tended use, it is now my go-to com­pact for touch-ups, thanks to the con­ve­nient pack­ag­ing and gen­er­ously sized mir­ror. The light­weight, dough-like pow­der ab­sorbs ex­cess oil from the skin, to pre­vent make-up from break­ing up and trans­fer­ring onto your mask.</p>
    <p>It also claims to lock mois­ture in the skin while con­trol­ling oil, and I find just that thin veil of pow­der mat­ti­fies shine with­out dulling your skin’s nat­u­ral glow.</p>
    <p>Avail­able at the Hera Ion bou­tique and heraon­line.sg</p>
    <p>CLARINS LIP COM­FORT OIL IN­TENSE, $36</p>
    <p>Every now and then, I still wear lip prod­ucts – with or with­out a mask – just to re­mind my lip­sticks that I have not died.</p>
    <p>My favourite at home is this coloured lip oil from French brand Clarins, a rel­a­tively new for­mula that builds on its cult Lip Com­fort Oil. Con­sider it a hy­brid of liq­uid lip­stick, gloss and lip oil – more mois­tur­is­ing than a lip balm yet with im­pres­sive colour pay­off and shine.</p>
    <p>And “in­tense” is right – the for­mula is in­tensely nour­ish­ing, smooths over fine lines in the lips and, mirac­u­lously, never feels sticky. The colour fades beau­ti­fully and nat­u­rally through­out the day, leav­ing you with plump, hy­drated lips in this con­fus­ing hu­mid­ity.</p>
    <p>Of the eight shades, the light­est – 01 In­tense Nude – is per­fect for ev­ery­day wear. I am al­ready eye­ing some of the deeper hues for when glam­orous nights out, sans mask, are safe again .</p>
    <p>Avail­able at Clarins bou­tiques and clarins.com.sg</p>
