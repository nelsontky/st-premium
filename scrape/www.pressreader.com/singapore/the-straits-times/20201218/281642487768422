    <p>About 3,010 jobs are avail­able in the fi­nan­cial ser­vice sec­tor here, with nine in 10 for pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians.</p>
    <p>They make up 57 per cent of the nearly 5,200 job, trainee­ship and at­tach­ment open­ings avail­able in the sec­tor as at the end of last month, said the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) yes­ter­day in its fi­nal job sit­u­a­tion re­port for the year.</p>
    <p>Roles with the high­est num­ber of job va­can­cies in­clude com­pli­ance of­fi­cers or risk an­a­lysts, which have a me­dian monthly pay of $9,100, as well as soft­ware, Web and mul­ti­me­dia de­vel­op­ers, which have a me­dian monthly pay of $7,750.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to these va­can­cies, the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore’s (MAS) Em­ploy­ment Out­look Sur­vey found in June that more than 30 fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions in­tend to hire for about 1,800 jobs from July this year to June next year.</p>
    <p>Half of these po­si­tions are in tech­nol­ogy func­tions, in­clud­ing ap­pli­ca­tion de­vel­op­ers, ap­pli­ca­tion architects and busi­ness an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>In­creased hir­ing has been ob­served in pri­vate bank­ing and wealth man­age­ment, cor­po­rate bank­ing, con­sumer bank­ing and in­sur­ance, ac­cord­ing to the pi­lot MAS sur­vey.</p>
    <p>“MAS con­tin­ues to look for new op­por­tu­ni­ties to en­trench, grow and strengthen our en­ablers, with the end out­come of en­sur­ing that our fi­nan­cial ser­vices sec­tor con­tin­ues to cre­ate good jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans,” said Ms Thong Leng Yeng, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of MAS’ fi­nan­cial cen­tre de­vel­op­ment de­part­ment.</p>
    <p>Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing, who was on a visit to United Over­seas Bank with Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo and Ms Thong yes­ter­day, said the fi­nan­cial ser­vice sec­tor has done well, with 4.7 per cent growth amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>How­ever, “dis­rup­tion in the fi­nan­cial ser­vices sec­tor will con­tinue, if not ac­cel­er­ate”, he added.</p>
    <p>Adop­tion of tech­nol­ogy and data use were sped up around the world, en­abling new prod­ucts and ser­vices. They will also sup­port the in­no­va­tion nec­es­sary to meet the in­creas­ingly di­verse needs from var­i­ous seg­ments of the mar­ket, said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>De­spite these changes, the need for peo­ple to trust in fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions re­mains the same. Sin­ga­pore has es­tab­lished it­self as a safe har­bour for funds amid the pan­demic and geopo­lit­i­cal shifts, and it must con­tinue to lever­age this as a key ad­van­tage, said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>“Our am­bi­tion is for us to strengthen our po­si­tion as the lead­ing fi­nan­cial hub in Asia, in ser­vice of the global mar­ket. We see a great op­por­tu­nity dur­ing this cri­sis to strengthen this po­si­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>To re­alise Sin­ga­pore’s am­bi­tion, there are three shifts that need to be ad­dressed, said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>The first is dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, where new busi­ness mod­els and fi­nan­cial prod­ucts are cre­ated based on data.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, even more for­eign banks in Sin­ga­pore will have to serve over­seas mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Third, the fi­nan­cial ser­vice sec­tor will no longer op­er­ate in a silo. In­stead, it will have to op­er­ate as a net­work with other sec­tors such as the le­gal, trade and re­tail sec­tors.</p>
    <p>To sup­port the sec­tor’s growth in these ar­eas, MAS has adopted a pro­gres­sive stance in its reg­u­la­tions to al­low new fi­nan­cial prod­ucts and ser­vices to be in­tro­duced in the mar­ket, but the skills of the lo­cal work­force must also be up­graded and re­main rel­e­vant, he added.</p>
    <p>To­gether with the In­sti­tute of Bank­ing and Fi­nance, MAS said, it will part­ner fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to cre­ate jobs and pro­gres­sion op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans, to build a pipe­line of lo­cal tal­ent in the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>MAS will also sup­port fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to groom Sin­ga­pore­ans with high po­ten­tial for lead­er­ship roles through struc­tured tal­ent de­vel­op­ment pro­grammes and re­gional post­ings.</p>
    <p>New train­ing and at­tach­ment pro­grammes will also help mid-ca­reer pro­fes­sion­als move into growth ar­eas in the sec­tor. Em­ploy­ers can also tap ca­reer con­ver­sion pro­grammes to hire mid-ca­reer job seek­ers.</p>
    <p>So far, 1,900 ex­ist­ing work­ers in the sec­tor whose jobs were at risk of be­ing lost to au­to­ma­tion have been reskilled and re­de­ployed into new roles. An­other 3,400 work­ers are or will be un­der­go­ing reskilling for new roles.</p>
