    <p>Europe is fac­ing the prospect of a re­turn of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic as the num­ber of new recorded in­fec­tions con­tin­ues to climb.</p>
    <p>The sharp jump has put Euro­pean gov­ern­ments on high alert as hol­i­day­mak­ers re­turn home af­ter the tra­di­tional Au­gust break and schools pre­pare to re­open.</p>
    <p>A grave spec­tre is haunt­ing Europe: the threat of the re­turn of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic as the num­ber of new recorded in­fec­tions con­tin­ues to rise in the con­ti­nent’s most pop­u­lous coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The sharp jump in in­fec­tion statis­tics has put Euro­pean gov­ern­ments on high alert, par­tic­u­larly as hol­i­day­mak­ers re­turn home to big cities af­ter the tra­di­tional Au­gust break, and teach­ers and pupils through­out the con­ti­nent pre­pare for the start of the school year af­ter months of dis­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>But all Euro­pean gov­ern­ments are ea­ger to avoid reim­pos­ing the blan­ket lock­down and other dras­tic con­trols on the free­dom of move­ment seen in the ear­lier stages of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the po­lit­i­cal nar­ra­tive in Europe has changed from a de­ter­mi­na­tion to do ev­ery­thing to re­duce in­fec­tions, to a new ap­proach which bal­ances con­trol mea­sures with the need to al­low na­tional economies to re­cover from the deep­est re­ces­sion since World War II.</p>
    <p>Spain has the du­bi­ous hon­our of lead­ing the re­in­fec­tion wave in Europe. It has re­ported about 8,000 new cases on a daily ba­sis re­cently, or j ust over 150 new cases per 100,000 in­hab­i­tants, a key sta­tis­ti­cal ref­er­ence point used by the Euro­pean Cen­tre for Dis­ease Preven­tion and Con­trol.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond-high­est in­fec­tion rate is in the small is­land state of Malta, which has reg­is­tered 120 new cases per 100,000 res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>France has more than 60 new cases per 100,000 in­hab­i­tants.</p>
    <p>By com­par­i­son, Bri­tain and Ger­many are record­ing around 20 cases per 100,000, al­though in both coun­tries, in­fec­tion trends are also slowly edg­ing up.</p>
    <p>The fact that coun­tries such as Spain, Malta and France are lead­ing the re­in­fec­tion wave also pro­vides an in­di­ca­tion on the key driver: All are prime tourist des­ti­na­tions.</p>
    <p>Europe’s tourism in­dus­try – key to the economies of some of the con­ti­nent’s more vul­ner­a­ble coun­tries – started open­ing for busi­ness last month, with all the safety reg­u­la­tions in place.</p>
    <p>Beaches were clut­tered with signs ask­ing hol­i­day­mak­ers to keep a dis­tance of 2m from one an­other, ho­tels can­celled buf­fet din­ners and po­lice forces claimed to be at hand to en­force safety mea­sures.</p>
    <p>But in re­al­ity, bars and night­clubs largely ig­nored the rules, and gov­ern­ments did not seem too bothered ei­ther; al­co­hol con­sump­tion not only pro­duces large profit mar­gins for op­er­a­tors but, to­gether with the sun, is an es­sen­tial hol­i­day in­gre­di­ent for many Euro­peans.</p>
    <p>The re­sult is that in­fec­tions are largely among young peo­ple. And this means that, at least for the mo­ment, higher in­fec­tions are not re­sult­ing in a greater num­ber of peo­ple hos­pi­talised in a crit­i­cal con­di­tion, or in a spike of those killed by the virus.</p>
    <p>A tweak in the way Euro­pean gov­ern­ments count the num­ber of fa­tal­i­ties is also keep­ing these fig­ures down; mor­tal­ity statis­tics now in­clude only those who die within 21 days of be­ing di­ag­nosed with the virus, thereby ex­clud­ing the el­derly, who may have been in­fected, but who could have died from other nat­u­ral causes.</p>
    <p>The low mor­tal­ity and lack of im­me­di­ate pres­sure on med­i­cal ser­vices have al­lowed gov­ern­ments to adopt a more re­laxed re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Upon his re­turn from an al­most three-week hol­i­day, Span­ish Prime Min­is­ter Pe­dro Sanchez re­in­stated the tra­di­tion of ad­dress­ing his na­tion daily.</p>
    <p>“The data isn’t good. The sit­u­a­tion is wor­ri­some,” he ad­mit­ted. But, he added, “we can’t al­low the pan­demic to take over our lives again”.</p>
    <p>So, in­stead of a to­tal lock­down, the gov­ern­ment has left pub­lic health de­ci­sions with the 19 re­gional gov­ern­ments.</p>
    <p>But it re­mains de­ter­mined to open schools as planned.</p>
    <p>France is adopt­ing the same ap­proach of de­lay­ing in­fec­tion rates rather than at­tempt­ing to elim­i­nate them.</p>
    <p>“There is no such thing as a ‘zero risk’ so­ci­ety”, French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron said in a re­cent tele­vised ad­dress.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment, ac­cused of mis­han­dling the ini­tial phase of the cri­sis, is jumpier, and keeps slap­ping new quar­an­tine or­ders on some Euro­pean coun­tries.</p>
    <p>But else­where in Europe, the de­ter­mi­na­tion is to not re­turn to the old blan­ket lock­down poli­cies; na­tion­wide re­stric­tions such as those im­ple­mented in New Zealand are no longer con­sid­ered prac­ti­cal for Euro­peans.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­thing may change, how­ever, if the in­fec­tions that now af­fect younger cit­i­zens spread to other age groups, as they will when hol­i­day­mak­ers re­turn to their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>French Health Min­is­ter Olivier Veran ad­mits that this is al­ready hap­pen­ing in his coun­try, with in­fec­tions ris­ing among the el­derly in the city of Mar­seille.</p>
    <p>“We have to avoid this sit­u­a­tion at all costs,” he warns.</p>
