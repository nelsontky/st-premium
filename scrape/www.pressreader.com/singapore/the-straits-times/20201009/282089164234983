    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force’s An­tiS­cam Cen­tre (ASC) has re­cov­ered more than US$4.91 mil­lion (S$6.69 mil­lion) in an al­leged business e-mail scam.</p>
    <p>It is the largest sin­gle sum the cen­tre has re­cov­ered since it was set up in June last year.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, the po­lice said they launched an in­ves­ti­ga­tion af­ter re­ceiv­ing alerts on Satur­day from United Overseas Bank (UOB) and the United States’ Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>A for­eign bank, which the po­lice de­clined to iden­tify, had con­tacted UOB to ur­gently re­call US$5 mil­lion that was il­le­gally trans­ferred to a Sin­ga­pore-based UOB ac­count be­long­ing to a lo­cal firm.</p>
    <p>UOB told re­porters that it froze the Sin­ga­pore bank ac­count within minutes of the alert. Pre­lim­i­nary po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions showed that the monies were moved fol­low­ing an al­leged business e-mail scam.</p>
    <p>Work­ing with UOB, the ASC was able to re­cover more than US$4.91 mil­lion. Po­lice said they are trac­ing the re­main­ing sum.</p>
    <p>The bank said it is the largest sum the bank’s branches here have re­cov­ered from a scam.</p>
    <p>The po­lice com­mended the lo­cal bank for “their in­valu­able as­sis­tance i n the re­cov­ery of the monies”, adding that the pub­lic should re­main vig­i­lant of such scams which in­volve com­pro­mised e-mail ad­dresses.</p>
    <p>“Such scams in­volve de­ceiv­ing busi­nesses through spoof­ing of com­pany or client e-mail ad­dresses and mak­ing them trans­fer large amounts of monies into the wrong hands,” the po­lice added.</p>
    <p>At least 209 re­ports of business e-mail com­pro­mise scams were re­ceived here in the first six months of the year, up from 164 cases in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the po­lice said the to­tal amount scammed has de­creased. Vic­tims were cheated of at least $15.9 mil­lion be­tween Jan­uary and June, down from the $22.3 mil­lion in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>The largest sum re­cov­ered pre­vi­ously was $6.4 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>It was part of the €6.64 mil­lion (S$10.7 mil­lion) a French phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany was scammed into trans­fer­ring to a Sin­ga­pore bank ac­count to pay for a large ship­ment of sur­gi­cal masks and hand sani­tiser.</p>
    <p>UOB re­cov­ered around $5.3 mil­lion of the S$6.4 mil­lion sum, af­ter it was alerted to the trans­ac­tion on March 14.</p>
    <p>The po­lice yes­ter­day re­minded com­pa­nies to adopt crime preven­tion mea­sures, such as ed­u­cat­ing staff to be mind­ful of any new or sud­den changes in pay­ment in­struc­tions and bank ac­counts.</p>
    <p>They said firms should also ver­ify pay­ment in­struc­tions by call­ing the e-mail sender via phone num­bers in their records in­stead of un­known num­bers pro­vided in the fraud­u­lent e-mail.</p>
    <p>To se­cure their com­pany’s e-mail ac­count from be­ing hacked, the po­lice ad­vise busi­nesses to use strong pass­words and change them reg­u­larly. Two-Fac­tor Au­then­ti­ca­tion should also be used when­ever pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>For scam-re­lated ad­vice, the pub­lic can call the anti-scam helpline on 1800-722-6688 or go to www.sca­malert.sg</p>
