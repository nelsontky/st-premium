    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Dolly Par­ton may pose for Play­boy again when she turns 75 next year.</p>
    <p>She be­came the first Amer­i­can coun­try singer to pose for the adult mag­a­zine when she ap­peared in a bunny suit on its cover in the Oc­to­ber 1978 is­sue. She was 32 then.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with BBC Ra­dio last Satur­day, Par­ton, now 74, was asked if she was cur­rently in talks to pose for Play­boy for her 75th birth­day, which is in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>“Well, there’s some truth in that,” she said. “I just might do it. If I can do it in good taste and they want it, we’ll do it along with a re­ally good in­ter­view in­side. So, yeah, it’s pos­si­ble. Yep, we’ve talked about it.”</p>
    <p>In March, she had said in an in­ter­view with 60 Minutes Aus­tralia that she had no plans to re­tire.</p>
    <p>“I just turned 74 and I plan to be on the cover of Play­boy mag­a­zine again,” said the singer who is fa­mous for songs such as Jo­lene (1973) and 9 To 5 (1980).</p>
    <p>Par­ton, who has been mar­ried to busi­ness­man Carl Dean, 78, since 1966, also joked that she might don the same suit which she wore in 1978.</p>
    <p>She also posted her photo from the 1978 shoot in Jan­uary this year when she be­gan a meme chal­lenge by post­ing four dif­fer­ent photos of her­self on var­i­ous so­cial me­dia plat­forms – LinkedIn, Face­book, In­sta­gram and Tin­der. The bunny photo was for Tin­der.</p>
    <p>It is not sure in what for­mat Par­ton will pose for Play­boy, if it does hap­pen, as the mag­a­zine had an­nounced in March that it would go fully dig­i­tal af­ter the spring edi­tion.</p>
