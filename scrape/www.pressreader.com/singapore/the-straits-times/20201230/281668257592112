    <p>With the coro­n­avirus pan­demic mak­ing large-scale events im­pos­si­ble, or­gan­is­ers have had to find ways to stage con­fer­ences and sport­ing events while abid­ing by safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>En­ter hy­brid events, which allow a mix of vir­tual par­tic­i­pants and some who are phys­i­cally present at the event venue.</p>
    <p>This new ap­proach has be­come in­creas­ingly pop­u­lar in the new nor­mal, and Sin­ga­pore has been quick to em­brace the mixed for­mat as a way to keep its bat­tered meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­fer­ences and ex­hi­bi­tions (Mice) sec­tor go­ing amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic re­sulted in the can­cel­la­tion of sev­eral ma­jor events, in­clud­ing this year’s Sin­ga­pore Air­lines Sin­ga­pore Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>Apart from dis­ap­pointed For­mula One fans, at­ten­dees of the All That Mat­ters con­fer­ence – which gath­ers the most in­flu­en­tial play­ers in the global sport and en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try, and is held an</p>
    <p>nu­ally in the build-up to the night race – were also left frus­trated as the busi­ness fo­rum at The Ritz</p>
    <p>Carl­ton, Mil­lenia Sin­ga­pore could not pro­ceed in its usual man­ner.</p>
    <p>Due to Covid-19, tens of thou</p>
    <p>sands of fans can no longer gather to share the emo­tion of live sport.</p>
    <p>Mice events that brought to­gether in­dus­try lead­ers and ex­perts now do not have the li­cence to move freely across borders.</p>
    <p>But ad­ver­sity is also fer­tile ground for in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>Both sec­tors have taken steps to evolve into hy­brids. As Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong re­cently de­scribed it, event or­gan­is­ers are lever­ag­ing tech­nol­ogy to de­liver “a more en­gag­ing and in­ter­ac­tive ex­pe­ri­ence within safety guide­lines” for con­sumers.</p>
    <p>The Stan­dard Char­tered Sin­ga­pore Marathon, which in the past wel­comed about 50,000 run­ners, is one such ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>In­stead of can­celling this year’s edi­tion – as or­gan­is­ers of the Ber­lin and Tokyo Marathon had done – the race’s or­gan­is­ers in­cor­po­rated a vir­tual race and fea­tured aug­mented re­al­ity for the first time, draw­ing more than 12,000 en­trants, with about 37 per cent of</p>
    <p>them hail­ing from over­seas.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal event man­age­ment com­pany Or­ange Room or­gan­ised sev­eral vir­tual events. Its man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Elvin Ting noted that the merg­ing of the on­line and off­line space will be the new nor­mal for mass sports events till the pan­demic is over.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment, through na­tional agency Sport Sin­ga­pore, launched the “Blended” ini­tia­tive in Oc­to­ber, with $5 mil­lion set aside for event or­gan­is­ers, event man­age­ment com­pa­nies, pri­vate academies and clubs to en­gage Sin­ga­pore­ans via “phy­gi­tal” hy­brid events.</p>
    <p>This is part of the $50 mil­lion Sports Re­silience Pack­age to boost the do­mes­tic ecosys­tem.</p>
    <p>Another pri­or­ity for the Gov­ern­ment is to safe­guard the Mice in­dus­try, which sup­ports more than 34,000 jobs with an eco­nomic value-add of $3.8 bil­lion, or nearly 1 per cent of the coun­try’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, noted a Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board-com­mis­sioned re­port last year.</p>
    <p>The Mice sec­tor is one of seven ar­eas which in­dus­try-led coali­tion groups, con­vened by the Emerg­ing Stronger Task­force, are study­ing.</p>
    <p>The Al­liance for Ac­tion team, tasked with bring­ing back trav­ellers, aims to re-es­tab­lish Sin­ga­pore as a lead­ing Mice des­ti­na­tion and main­tain the coun­try’s po­si­tion as one of the top 10 cities in the world by in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tor traf­fic.</p>
    <p>Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said last month that Sin­ga­pore is “not go­ing to play de­fen­sive by just try­ing to get back to where we were” in the Mice space. It can gain a com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tage if it can en­sure the health se­cu­rity of in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tors in a faster and better way, he added.</p>
    <p>Last month’s Trav­elRe­vive, a two-day travel event at the Sands Expo and Con­ven­tion Cen­tre, was the first trade show here to pilot new safety mea­sures un­der the newly devel­oped hy­brid event trade show pro­to­type for safe busi­ness events, safe itin­er­ar­ies and dig­i­tal en­abler tools.</p>
    <p>It is in­tended to pave the way for more in­ter­na­tional trade shows to be held here in the first quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>Recog­ni­tion of Sin­ga­pore’s han­dling of the Covid-19 pan­demic was ev­i­dent ear­lier this month when the Repub­lic was se­lected to host the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum’s an­nual meet­ing in May next year, in place of the usual venue, Switzer­land.</p>
    <p>The fo­rum will, for the first time, in­clude a vir­tual com­po­nent to allow greater par­tic­i­pa­tion amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try play­ers agreed that the de­ci­sion was a ma­jor en­dorse­ment of Sin­ga­pore’s ca­pa­bil­i­ties as a lead­ing global Mice hub, and would hope­fully lead to more job and busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>One might say the new year brings a unique hy­brid of chal­lenges and op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
