    <p>“Did you boo­gie?”</p>
    <p>That is the ques­tion Kylie Minogue will likely ask if she knows that you have lis­tened to her new al­bum Disco.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian pop star’s 15th al­bum, re­leased yes­ter­day, caps a year filled with dance-pop re­leases from Dua Lipa, Doja Cat, Jessie Ware, Lady Gaga and The Weeknd, but for Minogue, disco is noth­ing new.</p>
    <p>For more than three decades, she has made glit­ter­ing tracks with puls­ing beats – I Should Be So Lucky (1987), Bet­ter The Devil You Know (1990), Can’t Get You Out Of My Head (2001) and All The Lovers (2010).</p>
    <p>This time around, she hopes to help peo­ple es­cape at a mo­ment when “truth is stranger than fic­tion”, she said on a re­cent video call.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing from the lounge in her Lon­don home, Minogue talked about trans­form­ing part of that room into a stu­dio dur­ing quar­an­tine by hang­ing du­vets, blan­kets and a disco ball, of course.</p>
    <p>She used an old mi­cro­phone and GarageBand to record demos in a space that she said re­sem­bled what chil­dren might cre­ate when camp­ing out in a liv­ing room. But it got the job done.</p>
    <p>“I just felt, if kids are do­ing this – mak­ing al­bums in their bed­room – then, come on, Minogue, you’ve got to be able to do this,” she said.</p>
    <p>Minogue talked about her cul­tural must-haves, which she noted will likely change over time. These are edited ex­cerpts from the con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
