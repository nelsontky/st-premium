    <p>HONG KONG • As Hong Kong bat­tles a new wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions with yet an­other round of so­cial curbs, a sense of fa­tigue with the con­fus­ing and in­con­sis­tent na­ture of the city’s pan­demic re­sponse is set­ting in among busi­ness own­ers and res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Though the Asian fi­nan­cial cen­tre has thus far been rel­a­tively un­scathed – with just 81 cases per 100,000 peo­ple out of a densely packed 7 mil­lion pop­u­la­tion – the city has en­coun­tered more waves than most other places and is en­ter­ing its fourth round of stop­start re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>“Hong Kong has un­doubt­edly been lucky with the pan­demic so far. What has been miss­ing is a clear, public road map as to how and when re­stric­tions will be im­ple­mented and when the rules will be re­laxed,” said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ni­cholas Thomas, a health se­cu­rity ex­pert at the City Univer­sity of Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus has been an un­pre­dictable and volatile foe, war­rant­ing nim­ble and quick-chang­ing re­ac­tion from gov­ern­ments. But as the pan­demic ap­proaches its first an­niver­sary, Hong Kong’s res­i­dents and busi­ness own­ers are in­creas­ingly look­ing with envy to the struc­tured re­sponse sys­tems in coun­tries such as New Zealand, South Korea and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The for­mer Bri­tish colony’s com­par­a­tively er­ratic re­sponse is deep­en­ing the cri­sis in an econ­omy al­ready on its knees from months of restive street protests fol­lowed by the pan­demic, they say.</p>
    <p>The sharp rise in new lo­cal cases in the past week has been linked to so­cial danc­ing venues, yet of­fi­cials have closed bars, karaoke rooms and mas­sage par­lours.</p>
    <p>Like in pre­vi­ous rounds, the re­stric­tions are for a week or two at a time, leav­ing busi­ness own­ers in a state of sus­pended an­i­ma­tion and un­able to plan long term.</p>
    <p>“I’m wait­ing for Fri­day af­ter­noon to see if they’re clos­ing more class­rooms,” said Ms Stephanie Hold­ing, a mother of three who runs her own busi­ness from home. She would rather see a sys­tem that lets peo­ple “know what’s af­fected and when”, she said.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong says it takes a flex­i­ble “sup­press and lift” ap­proach to virus re­stric­tions based on the ad­vice of med­i­cal ad­vis­ers.</p>
    <p>But other “high risk” busi­nesses such as gyms and res­tau­rants do not know when they will be asked to close, and only some are re­quired to en­force a lit­tle-used health-code app be­fore al­low­ing</p>
    <p>pa­trons in. To add to the con­fu­sion, school and child­care ser­vices for younger kids were again shut down ear­lier this month – but be­cause of an out­break of the com­mon cold and not Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In other places with dif­fer­ent phases or alert lev­els that de­ter­mine what re­stric­tions are ac­ti­vated at what stage of in­fec­tion, “we know we’ve reached this level and this is what will take place next”, said Mr Al­lan Ze­man, an eco­nomic ad­viser to Hong Kong Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam and chair­man of Lan Kwai Fong Group, a ma­jor land­lord in the city’s bar district.</p>
