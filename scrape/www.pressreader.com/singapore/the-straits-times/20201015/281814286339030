    <p>With a view to­wards bet­ter in­te­grat­ing China’s two spe­cial ad­min­is­tra­tive re­gions into what will be the new eco­nomic pow­er­house, Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping is en­cour­ag­ing young peo­ple from Hong Kong and Ma­cau to move to the Greater Bay Area.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in Shen­zhen yes­ter­day to mark the 40th an­niver­sary of the es­tab­lish­ment of China’s first spe­cial eco­nomic zone in the south­ern city, Mr Xi called for the deep­en­ing of in­te­gra­tion be­tween young peo­ple in Hong Kong, Ma­cau and Guang­dong prov­ince to “in­crease their sense of be­long­ing to the moth­er­land”.</p>
    <p>“With Shen­zhen be­ing an im­por­tant en­gine in its devel­op­ment, we should seize the ma­jor his­tor­i­cal op­por­tu­ni­ties in the devel­op­ment of the Greater Bay Area, pro­mote the align­ment of eco­nomic rules, and in­sti­tu­tions of Guang­dong, Hong Kong and Ma­cau,” the Chi­nese Pres­i­dent said.</p>
    <p>He added that China should “con­tinue to en­cour­age and guide our com­pa­tri­ots in Hong Kong, Ma­cau and Taiwan, as well as over­seas Chi­nese, to play their im­por­tant roles in in­vest­ment, en­trepreneur­ship and two-way open­ness, so that they can make new con­tri­bu­tions to the devel­op­ment of the spe­cial eco­nomic zones”.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi also said that Shen­zhen will be tasked with “en­rich­ing the new prac­tice of one coun­try, two sys­tems”, with­out elab­o­rat­ing.</p>
    <p>There have been grow­ing con­cerns that Hong Kong has been side­lined in Bei­jing’s Greater Bay Area plan.</p>
    <p>But Hong Kong Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam, who can­celled her an­nual pol­icy ad­dress to lead a del­e­ga­tion to the event, said ahead of the speech that “there need not be di­rect com­pe­ti­tion be­tween Hong Kong and Shen­zhen”.</p>
    <p>“We have free­dom of cap­i­tal flow and cur­rency ex­change, a le­gal sys­tem in line with in­ter­na­tional stan­dards and a large pool of pro­fes­sional talent,” Mrs Lam had told Shen­zhen Satel­lite TV, adding that these can com­ple­ment Shen­zhen’s tech­no­log­i­cal ca­pa­bil­i­ties and ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>Her com­ments come as her gov­ern­ment strug­gles against low public trust and an un­wa­ver­ing pan­demic to boost a re­ces­sion­ary econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The an­nual pol­icy ad­dress, orig­i­nally slated for yes­ter­day, will be post­poned to late next month in an un­prece­dented move, as Mrs Lam meets Bei­jing of­fi­cials this month to dis­cuss strate­gies to help Hong Kong’s econ­omy.</p>
