    <p>Movie star Ethan Hawke takes to the small screen for The Good Lord Bird, a pe­riod drama in which he plays Amer­i­can abo­li­tion­ist John Brown, a white man who fought to end slav­ery in the 19th cen­tury.</p>
    <p>But the Train­ing Day (2001) and Dead Poets So­ci­ety (1989) ac­tor prom­ises that the lim­ited se­ries will not of­fer a “white saviour” ac­count of Brown’s role in the Amer­i­can Civil War.</p>
    <p>And, un­usu­ally for a drama about slav­ery, the se­ries – which airs on Mon­days at 10pm on FX (Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 310 and StarHub TV Chan­nel 507) and Fox+ – is also a com­edy.</p>
    <p>The story is based on the 2013 award-win­ning semi-his­tor­i­cal novel of the same name by James McBride, and is told from the per­spec­tive of a young en­slaved boy freed by Brown.</p>
    <p>The boy j oins Brown’s rag­tag gang of abo­li­tion­ist sol­diers and bears wit­ness as they fail to launch a slave up­ris­ing but in­ad­ver­tently help spark the Civil War.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the me­dia in Los An­ge­les ear­lier this year, Hawke, 49, seems well aware that the show and his char­ac­ter could be re­ceived neg­a­tively for putting a white man front and cen­tre.</p>
    <p>But he wanted to take it on any­way. “A white dude had to play John Brown – he was white. I wanted to play him.”</p>
    <p>Hawke sug­gests that as a his­tor­i­cal fig­ure, Brown makes some white Amer­i­cans un­com­fort­able be­cause he shows that the suf­fer­ing of black slaves was well known at the time.</p>
    <p>This is per­haps why Brown’s story has been largely ab­sent from Amer­i­can class­rooms, Hawke says.</p>
    <p>“What’s fas­ci­nat­ing, and I think part of why he doesn’t get taught, is if you re­ally teach John Brown, then you have to un­der­stand how much white Amer­ica un­der­stood about what was hap­pen­ing i n hu­man bondage and how ter­ri­ble it was. And peo­ple like the idea that maybe peo­ple didn’t know,” says the four­time Os­car nom­i­nee, who starred in the ac­claimed Be­fore tril­ogy of ro­man­tic films with Julie Delpy (1995 to 2013) and the com­ing-ofage drama Boy­hood (2014).</p>
    <p>Hawke draws a com­par­i­son be­tween Brown and those who are con­sid­ered ex­treme be­cause they are bat­tling the sta­tus quo to­day, al­though they may ul­ti­mately be seen</p>
    <p>I re­mem­ber when the book came out, some peo­ple were like, ‘Wait, you can make jokes about this? This story that’s touch­ing the great na­tional wound?’ Yes, you can... when you do it with love and wit and silli­ness and in­tel­li­gence, and don’t ig­nore the pain.”</p>
    <p>as be­ing on the right side of his­tory.</p>
    <p>He points to one of his pre­vi­ous films, First Re­formed (2017), in which he played a pas­tor who taught young peo­ple about the</p>
    <p>Un­der­ground Rail­road, a se­cret net­work to hide es­caped Amer­i­can slaves.</p>
    <p>The peo­ple who hid them were con­sid­ered zealots at the time, but</p>
    <p>“the light of his­tory of­ten changes what the def­i­ni­tion of zealot is”, he re­marks.</p>
    <p>“John Brown is some­body who’s clearly on the right side of his­tory, who went to ex­treme mea­sures for his be­liefs, and you can find them all over the globe – peo­ple who are of­ten on the wrong side of his­tory.</p>
    <p>“If you re­ally study this char­ac­ter, he asks a lot of you philo­soph­i­cally be­cause he chal­lenges why some­body would ac­cept the unac­cept­able,” the ac­tor adds.</p>
    <p>At the same press con­fer­ence, au­thor McBride, 63, chal­lenges those who would say this tale puts un­due em­pha­sis on Brown’s part in free­ing the slaves.</p>
    <p>“This is not the typ­i­cal story of the white saviour that comes to save African-Amer­i­can peo­ple; this is the African-Amer­i­can per­spec­tive on the white saviour that comes to save us. That’s why it’s so funny – it’s a story of car­i­ca­ture,” he says.</p>
    <p>For Hawke, the hu­mour is es­sen­tial. “I re­mem­ber when the book came out, some peo­ple were like, ‘Wait, you can make jokes about this? You can make this funny? This story that’s touch­ing the great na­tional wound?’” he says.</p>
    <p>“Yes, you can. When you do that – when you do it with love and wit and silli­ness and in­tel­li­gence, and don’t ig­nore the pain, you can do some­thing orig­i­nal.”</p>
