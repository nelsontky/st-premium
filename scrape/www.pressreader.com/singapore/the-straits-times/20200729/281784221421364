    <p>MADRID • Span­ish Prime Min­is­ter Pe­dro Sanchez, who has re­sponded an­grily to Bri­tain ratch­et­ing up its travel ban to Spain to in­clude pop­u­lar hol­i­day is­lands, now faces the prospect of los­ing German tourists in the busiest sum­mer month as well.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with broad­caster Telecinco, the Span­ish leader called Bri­tain’s de­ci­sion “un­bal­anced” and said there were more cases of Covid-19 in Bri­tain than in the Balearic and Ca­nary is­lands.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain yes­ter­day de­fended its de­ci­sion not to dis­tin­guish between the dif­fer­ent re­gions of Spain.</p>
    <p>With its tourism-re­liant econ­omy on its knees, Spain is keen to con­vince Bri­tain to re­con­sider as stranded Bri­tons, prospec­tive trav­ellers and air­lines all com­plained.</p>
    <p>To make mat­ters worse, Ger­many yes­ter­day rec­om­mended avoid­ing non-es­sen­tial travel to the Span­ish re­gions of Cat­alo­nia, Navarra and Aragon, cit­ing con­cerns over higher coro­n­avirus case num­bers and lo­cal lock­downs.</p>
    <p>Ger­mans are the main tourist group to Spain, be­hind Bri­tons.</p>
    <p>The moves fol­lowed a steady rise in new in­fec­tions in Spain last week and led other Euro­pean coun­tries, in­clud­ing France and Bel­gium, to be­gin ad­vis­ing against trips to some parts of Spain. The ad­vice has also cre­ated fric­tion.</p>
    <p>“We re­spect­fully dis­agree with the Span­ish gov­ern­ment,” Mr Simon Clarke, Bri­tain’s ju­nior Hous­ing, Com­mu­ni­ties and Lo­cal Gov­ern­ment Min­is­ter, told the BBC.</p>
    <p>“You do have to make de­ci­sions on a coun­try­wide ba­sis. There is go­ing to be in­ter­nal trans­fer within Spain.”</p>
    <p>Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son has al­ready or­dered ev­ery­one re­turn­ing home from Spain to be quar­an­tined for 14 days and his top diplo­mat told Sky News on Sun­day that “we can­not make apolo­gies for do­ing so”.</p>
    <p>The For­eign Of­fice said in a state­ment: “We have con­sid­ered the over­all sit­u­a­tion for Bri­tish na­tion­als trav­el­ling to and from the Balearic and Ca­nary is­lands, in­clud­ing the im­pact of the re­quire­ment to self-iso­late on re­turn to Bri­tain, and con­cluded that we should ad­vise Bri­tish na­tion­als against all non-es­sen­tial travel to the whole of Spain.”</p>
    <p>The Tele­graph news­pa­per has re­ported that the quar­an­tine mea­sures may be shaved to 10 days, to try and save some­thing of the hol­i­day sea­son.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Union is set to keep its ex­ter­nal borders shut to many coun­tries, in­clud­ing the United States, and is lean­ing to­wards short­en­ing a list of 13 – Canada, China, Ja­pan and South Korea among them – whose res­i­dents have the green light to visit the bloc, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Be­fore Mon­day’s an­nounce­ment, Spain’s tourism in­dus­try had hoped that the is­lands would be ex­empted from Bri­tain’s quar­an­tine re­quire­ment.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the of­fi­cial ad­vice was ex­tended to in­clude the pop­u­lar sum­mer des­ti­na­tions.</p>
