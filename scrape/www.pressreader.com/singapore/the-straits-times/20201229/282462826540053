    <p>It’s a pe­riod set­ting but hu­man na­ture doesn’t re­ally change... there are a lot of the same strug­gles. There’s still a po­si­tion that women are ex­pected to take in so­ci­ety and there’s pres­sure about how you look and if you are go­ing to get mar­ried.</p>
    <p>It may be set in 19th cen­tury Eng­land, but the stars of the ro­man­tic drama Bridger­ton prom­ise a “sexy, smart and chic” se­ries that of­fers plenty the mod­ern au­di­ence can re­late to – es­pe­cially when it comes to the pres­sure to “fil­ter” one’s ap­pear­ances and find a suit­able mate.</p>
    <p>The buzzy new show is from pro­ducer Shonda Rhimes, the hit­maker be­hind the se­ries Grey’s Anatomy (2005 to now) and Scan­dal (2012 to 2018). And it is the first ti­tle to air un­der her US$150 mil­lion (S$199 mil­lion) deal to de­velop con­tent for Net­flix – one of the rich­est of its kind in stream­ing his­tory.</p>
    <p>A pe­riod piece set in Re­gency Eng­land – the era of Pride And Prej­u­dice au­thor Jane Austen – it fol­lows the el­dest daugh­ter of the prom­i­nent Bridger­ton fam­ily, Daphne (Phoebe Dynevor), as she, her sib­lings and their peers nav­i­gate London’s cut-throat mar­riage market.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the press by video call, the Bri­tish cast – Dynevor and co-stars Jonathan Bai­ley and Ni­cola Cough­lan, who play Daphne’s brother An­thony and their neigh­bour, Pene­lope Feather­ing­ton – say any­one who wor­ries about how he comes across on so­cial me­dia will in­stantly iden­tify with the se­ries.</p>
    <p>Dynevor, 25, notes how “tough it is for young women and men grow­ing up now in a world where ev­ery­thing has a fil­ter on it – and it was no dif­fer­ent, re­ally, back then”.</p>
    <p>Her char­ac­ter Daphne “is sort of pre­sent­ing this fil­tered ver­sion of her­self to so­ci­ety” and has to con­tend with her ev­ery move be­ing an­a­lysed by an anony­mous gos­sip colum­nist, Lady Whis­tle­down – voiced by Sound Of Mu­sic (1965) star Julie An­drews.</p>
    <p>“There are so many par­al­lels to how we’re liv­ing now, it’s just set in a dif­fer­ent world,” says Dynevor, who ap­peared in the com­edy se­ries Younger (2015 to now).</p>
    <p>Cough­lan, 33, agrees. “It’s a pe­riod set­ting but hu­man na­ture doesn’t re­ally change even though the times do.</p>
    <p>“So there are a lot of the same strug­gles. There’s still a po­si­tion that women are ex­pected to take in so­ci­ety and there’s pres­sure about how you look and if you are go­ing to get mar­ried,” says the ac­tress, who ap­peared in the com­edy Derry Girls (2018 to now).</p>
    <p>“And the male char­ac­ters are deal­ing with the pres­sures of the pa­tri­archy too, which are re­ally com­plex.”</p>
    <p>Bai­ley says that like many of the shows made by Rhimes’ pro­duc­tion com­pany, Shon­da­land, Bridger­ton is “in­cred­i­bly sexy and smart and chic”.</p>
    <p>“But ac­tu­ally, the men­tal health of all these char­ac­ters is re­ally com­pli­cated, and (that feels rel­e­vant) at a time when the con­ver­sa­tion is all about be­ing able to talk to peo­ple about how you’re feel­ing,” says the 32-year-old star of crime drama Broad­church (2013 to 2017).</p>
    <p>“So with all the Bridger­ton and Feather­ing­ton sib­lings, you get these sear­ing por­tray­als that are very del­i­cate and about the dif­fer­ent ways in which you’re made to feel anx­ious or not good enough.</p>
    <p>“That’s the clas­sic Shon­da­land thing of trick­ing you with all this sex­i­ness, but at the heart of it, there’s re­ally dark stuff go­ing on and I think that’s where the hu­man­ity is,” Bai­ley says.</p>
    <p>It can be even more il­lu­mi­nat­ing to ex­am­ine these is­sues through the prism of a dif­fer­ent era, the ac­tors sug­gest.</p>
    <p>“As the au­di­ence, to watch some­thing that isn’t nec­es­sar­ily about to­day but re­flects lots of the same themes, you al­most en­gage with it more and see it more clearly,” Dynevor says.</p>
    <p>And Bai­ley notes: “Some­times, you can’t re­ally ex­plain or see your own so­ci­ety be­cause it’s too close to you. But you go back a cou­ple of hun­dred years and you re­alise it’s a hu­man thing.”</p>
    <p>Asked how they think they would have fared in the mar­riage stakes back then, the three ac­tors laugh­ingly re­ply in uni­son: “Ter­ri­bly.”</p>
    <p>“There were so many rules,” Cough­lan points out. “And if I had to be pre­sented to the queen, that would be mor­ti­fy­ing. Ev­ery­one is look­ing at you and the pres­sure of know­ing that (get­ting mar­ried) is what’s es­sen­tially go­ing to save your fam­ily fi­nan­cially, that’s re­ally stress­ful.”</p>
    <p>“It’s kind of a night­mare, isn’t it,” Bai­ley says.</p>
    <p>But he adds: “The bril­liant thing is we have come so far. We can sit here and all agree that the idea of be­ing emo­tion­ally re­stricted in who you’re sup­posed to love is a bad thing.</p>
    <p>“And that ev­ery­one should be al­lowed to love any­one.”</p>
