    <p>As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Ng Kok Hoe from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Pol­icy said pub­lic benches with di­viders or metal bars on them, among other things, are prime ex­am­ples of ur­ban fea­tures that are “de­fen­sive” or “hos­tile” to­wards the home­less (Bars, di­viders make spa­ces less wel­come to home­less: Ob­servers, Nov 30).</p>
    <p>He added that the ef­fect of such de­signs is to deny home­less peo­ple a safe and shel­tered place to lie down and rest.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Chong Keng Hua from the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign said so­ci­ety has to un­der­stand the need some­times “to be more gra­cious and re­cep­tive to peo­ple who are strug­gling”.</p>
    <p>Home­less­ness is a prob­lem in Sin­ga­pore as it is in every other part of the world. That we must be gra­cious and re­cep­tive to­wards the home­less is with­out ques­tion – they are a part of Sin­ga­pore as much as all of us. The ques­tion is how we in­tend to re­solve the prob­lem of home­less­ness.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent solution put for­ward by the Gov­ern­ment is to make Hous­ing Board ren­tal flats avail­able to the home­less.</p>
    <p>Where this is not an op­tion, they should be ad­mit­ted to tran­si­tional shel­ters funded by the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment. At th­ese shel­ters, so­cial work­ers can as­sist them with their fi­nan­cial and fam­ily is­sues.</p>
    <p>This is a long-term solution to the prob­lem of home­less­ness since it pro­vides an op­por­tu­nity for the des­ti­tute to find their foot­ing with a proper place to rest. They would then be in a po­si­tion to find proper em­ploy­ment to sup­port them­selves – and exit the vi­cious cir­cle of hav­ing no proper place to rest and thus be­ing un­able to find proper em­ploy­ment, which in turn leads to fur­ther fi­nan­cial ruin.</p>
    <p>This is the way to go.</p>
    <p>What also needs to be done is to in­crease outreach to those who are still sleep­ing rough, and to bring them into the govern­men­tal sys­tem of as­sis­tance. Lit­tle can be de­rived from mak­ing it eas­ier for them to sleep rough on pub­lic benches. Brent Lim Zi Jian</p>
    <p>Home­less­ness is a prob­lem in Sin­ga­pore as it is in every other part of the world. That we must be gra­cious and re­cep­tive to­wards the home­less is with­out ques­tion – they are a part of Sin­ga­pore as much as all of us.</p>
