    <p>Trainee­ships will be ex­panded to also cater to mid-ca­reer job seek­ers, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat an­nounced yes­ter­day dur­ing a visit to the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Cen­tre at Kam­pong Chai Chee Com­mu­nity Club.</p>
    <p>From Satur­day, mid-ca­reer job seek­ers will be able to ap­ply for over 13,000 com­pany at­tach­ments via the MyCa­reer­sFu­ture.sg por­tal.</p>
    <p>The at­tach­ments are part of the SGUnited Mid-Ca­reer Path­ways Pro­gramme and in­clude roles such as busi­ness de­vel­op­ment man­agers, soft­ware en­gi­neers, fi­nance an­a­lysts and e-com­merce as­so­ci­ates.</p>
    <p>They will come from the pool of po­si­tions ear­lier slated for fresh and re­cent grad­u­ates.</p>
    <p>The trainee­ship scheme for fresh grad­u­ates has at­tracted in­ter­est from more than 6,400 or­gan­i­sa­tions of­fer­ing more than 35,000 po­si­tions, which far ex­ceeds the num­ber of fresh and re­cent grad­u­ates who are likely to fill them, said Work­force Sin­ga­pore (WSG).</p>
    <p>WSG and the Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion, which is the pro­gramme man­ager, will thus work with the or­gan­i­sa­tions to open up over 13,000 of these ear­lier-ap­proved po­si­tions to mid-ca­reerists.</p>
    <p>“This will give host or­gan­i­sa­tions the op­tion to fill these po­si­tions with ex­pe­ri­enced mid-ca­reer in­di­vid­u­als, who bring with them a wealth of work ex­pe­ri­ence and skills,” said WSG.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said: “One thing which is very clear from both the ex­pe­ri­ences of the ca­reer coaches and</p>
    <p>One thing which is very clear from both the ex­pe­ri­ences of the ca­reer coaches and from my dis­cus­sion with the job seek­ers is that we all need to change and adapt. On the part of job seek­ers, we need to change our mind­sets about what are suit­able jobs. I’ve heard of many suc­cess­ful cases where peo­ple in var­i­ous jobs de­cide to try new things, de­cide to even take lower pay, be­cause... (they) need to re­build (their) ca­reers. So I’m very glad that these changes are ’’ hap­pen­ing.</p>
    <p>DEPUTY PRIME MIN­IS­TER HENG SWEE KEAT</p>
    <p>from my dis­cus­sion with the job seek­ers is that we all need to change and adapt.</p>
    <p>“On the part of job seek­ers, we need to change our mind­sets about what are suit­able jobs. I’ve heard of many suc­cess­ful cases where peo­ple in var­i­ous jobs de­cide to try new things, de­cide to even take lower pay, be­cause... (they) need to re­build (their) ca­reers. So I’m very glad that these changes are hap­pen­ing.”</p>
    <p>The mid-ca­reer at­tach­ments can range from four to nine months and must start by March 31 next year. A job is not guar­an­teed af­ter the at­tach­ment, but host or­gan­i­sa­tions can con­sider hir­ing work­ers who per­form well when busi­ness con­di­tions im­prove.</p>
    <p>Work­ers on the at­tach­ments will get a monthly train­ing al­lowance of be­tween $1,400 and $3,000, of which 80 per cent will be funded by the Gov­ern­ment, said WSG.</p>
    <p>Some firms al­ready on board are GIC, United Overseas Bank and Wat­sons Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>WSG chief ex­ec­u­tive Tan Choon Shian said: “We em­pathise with the anx­i­eties mid-ca­reer in­di­vid­u­als face dur­ing this dif­fi­cult time and have stepped up ef­forts to en­sure qual­ity at­tach­ments with clear de­vel­op­ment plans so that they can quickly and con­fi­dently em­bark on per­ma­nent jobs once the econ­omy re­cov­ers.”</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said that em­ploy­ers also have to adapt, pick­ing staff who might not be the per­fect fit but are will­ing to learn.</p>
    <p>“Em­ploy­ers must re­design jobs so that we can make the best use of the skills of our peo­ple, make full use of all the tools that we have put out un­der our In­dus­try Trans­for­ma­tion Maps, to both up­grade the skills of our work­ers and up­grade our op­er­a­tions. And i n fact, when t he Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion passes... they will be able to emerge stronger, they will be more com­pet­i­tive, more pro­duc­tive.”</p>
    <p>The at­tach­ment pro­grammes are part of the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age an­nounced in the For­ti­tude Bud­get speech in May.</p>
    <p>In total, some 100,000 jobs, trainee­ships and train­ing places will be cre­ated to help job seek­ers.</p>
    <p>WSG is also step­ping up ef­forts to make ser­vices more ac­ces­si­ble, with SGUnited Jobs and Skills Cen­tres set up around the is­land pro­vid­ing ca­reer ad­vice and job match­ing ser­vices. All Hous­ing Board towns will have a cen­tre by Aug 15, with eight open­ing on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>These cen­tres have helped 1,300 job seek­ers since the first batch of eight cen­tres started op­er­at­ing on July 1, said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>The agency is also hold­ing vir­tual ca­reer fairs on­line and set­ting up SGUnited Jobs and Skills in­for­ma­tion kiosks in ar­eas with high foot­fall. The next kiosk will be set up at Elias Mall in Pasir Ris to­mor­row.</p>
