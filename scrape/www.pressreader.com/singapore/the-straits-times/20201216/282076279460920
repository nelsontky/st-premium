    <p>What makes Sin­ga­pore home, truly? An ex­hi­bi­tion that opens on Satur­day at the Na­tional Mu­seum of Sin­ga­pore (NMS) seeks to pro­vide some an­swers by show­cas­ing more than 200 pho­to­graphs from na­tional ar­chives and con­trib­uted by the pub­lic, as well as more than 80 arte­facts from the na­tional col­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>Home, Truly: Grow­ing Up With Sin­ga­pore, 1950s To The Present ex­plores what liv­ing and grow­ing up in Sin­ga­pore has been like for peo­ple across dif­fer­ent gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>It is or­gan­ised by NMS in col­lab­o­ra­tion with The Straits Times, in con­junc­tion with the news­pa­per’s 175th an­niver­sary, as well as pho­tog­ra­phy mar­ket­place Pho­ton­ico and Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings (SPH).</p>
    <p>NMS di­rec­tor Chung May Khuen said that dif­fer­ent seg­ments of the com­mu­nity, in­clud­ing more than 100 youth, se­niors and vis­ually im­paired in­di­vid­u­als, were tapped by the cu­ra­tors to con­cep­tu­alise an ex­hi­bi­tion that would res­onate with di­verse au­di­ences.</p>
    <p>ST ed­i­tor War­ren Fer­nan­dez, who is also the ed­i­tor-in-chief of SPH’s English/Malay/Tamil Me­dia Group, said: “ST has been telling the story of Sin­ga­pore for 175 years, in­clud­ing its tran­si­tion from colony to in­de­pen­dence to a sense of be­ing iden­ti­fied as our own home.</p>
    <p>“We have cap­tured these in sto­ries, but also in vi­su­als – pho­tos, and now also in­creas­ingly on video. This show­case fea­tures high­lights of these ef­forts over the years, and will be both nos­tal­gic as well as stir­ring and in­spir­ing.”</p>
    <p>About 25 per cent of the pho­tos on dis­play were con­trib­uted by mem­bers of the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Hob­by­ist pho­tog­ra­pher Hor Kwok Kin, who has two pho­tos he took in the 1960s dis­played in the ex­hi­bi­tion, said the chance to show­case his work is a great hon­our.</p>
    <p>“Back then, it was just an in­ter­est for me,” the 81-year-old re­tired chef said in Man­darin about his hobby, adding that he never imag­ined his pho­tos would be ex­hib­ited.</p>
    <p>“I just walk around and see what I find in­ter­est­ing and I shoot it.</p>
    <p>“But with the pace at which things have changed over the years, when you com­pare places now to the pho­to­graphs I took of them in the 1960s, you can see the pho­tos’ his­tor­i­cal value.”</p>
    <p>For a more en­gag­ing ex­pe­ri­ence, vis­i­tors will be given a sty­lus pen for use on in­ter­ac­tive mul­ti­me­dia ex­hibits.</p>
    <p>This al­lows a “me­di­ated touch”, as the mu­seum has stopped us­ing touch screens amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, said NMS se­nior deputy di­rec­tor Wong Hong Suen.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors can also use a ra­dio fre­quency iden­ti­fi­ca­tion (RFID) tag at­tached to the sty­lus to re­spond to polls and quizzes, on top­ics such as whether they are will­ing to serve na­tional ser­vice.</p>
    <p>They can later tap the tag against a check-out booth to re­ceive a sum­mary of their re­sponses and find out more about what home means to them, based on their re­sponses.</p>
    <p>The ex­hi­bi­tion will also pilot an ac­ces­si­bil­ity ex­pe­ri­ence where vis­ually im­paired vis­i­tors can ex­plore in­de­pen­dently us­ing a smart land­mark nav­i­ga­tion cane and a com­pan­ion app.</p>
    <p>For Mr Chia Hong Sen, 24, who is vis­ually im­paired and helped to test the cane, this will be his first time tak­ing in an ex­hi­bi­tion in­de­pen­dently.</p>
    <p>“In­door nav­i­ga­tion is a chal­lenge that the vis­ually im­paired com­mu­nity faces, and this is a very good show­case of such tech­nol­ogy at work,” said the in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy ac­ces­si­bil­ity trainer and con­sul­tant with Guide Dogs Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“This is the right step for­ward, and I hope oth­ers in the com­mu­nity will also be keen to ex­pe­ri­ence it for them­selves and pro­vide feed­back so the ex­pe­ri­ence can be im­proved,” he said.</p>
    <p>The pilot will be­gin on Jan 21 next year, and more de­tails will be avail­able in the com­ing weeks, said the mu­seum. It will be the first time a mu­seum un­der the Na­tional Her­itage Board is us­ing RFID and tech­nol­ogy to aid the vis­ually im­paired in en­gag­ing in ex­hi­bi­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong said the mu­seum hopes that more vis­ually im­paired­friendly ex­hi­bi­tions will be rolled out if the pilot is suc­cess­ful.</p>
