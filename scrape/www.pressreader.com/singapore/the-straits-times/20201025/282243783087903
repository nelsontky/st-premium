    <p>BARCELONA Real Madrid averted a cri­sis in the best pos­si­ble way yes­ter­day by beat­ing Barcelona 3-1 in the first empty Cla­sico and land­ing an early blow in La Liga’s ti­tle race.</p>
    <p>Barca had the chance to in­flict a third con­sec­u­tive de­feat in all com­pe­ti­tions on their ri­vals and in­crease the pres­sure on Real coach Zine­dine Zi­dane.</p>
    <p>In­stead, Real’s away win earns them a six-point lead over the Cata­lans (seven) in the ta­ble, al­beit hav­ing played one game more.</p>
    <p>“It wasn’t an easy week for us,” said Real goal­keeper Thibaut Cour­tois af­ter the match at the Nou Camp. “We played games very quickly af­ter com­ing back from the in­ter­na­tional break and we weren’t at our best against Cadiz (1-0 loss) and Shakhtar (3-2 de­feat).</p>
    <p>“We wanted to play well here to­day and we’re very happy with the re­sult in this big game. We did what the the man­ager wanted us to do.</p>
    <p>“They’re a very strong team. Jordi Alba was in­flu­en­tial down the left­hand side and that’s where their goal came from. I had to make some saves and so did Neto.</p>
    <p>“We scored the penalty in the sec­ond half and, from there, we could have scored the third a bit ear­lier but for Neto.”</p>
    <p>Real cap­tain Ser­gio Ramos once again proved to be the man for the big oc­ca­sion as he con­verted a fiercely de­bated penalty.</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard, mak­ing a record 45th ap­pear­ance in the Cla­sico, was awarded the spot kick fol­low­ing a VAR (video as­sis­tant ref­eree) re­view, af­ter falling in the area when his shirt was tugged by Cle­ment Len­glet dur­ing a cor­ner.</p>
    <p>The de­fender showed his cus­tom­ary calm to score from the spot in the 63rd minute and re­store the cham­pi­ons’ lead. Fed­erico Valverde had opened the scor­ing in the fifth minute, only for Barca for­ward Ansu Fati, 17, to equalise less than three min­utes later.</p>
    <p>Barca ran out of steam in the sec­ond half and Real missed two big chances to seal the points af­ter Ramos’ penalty, be­fore sub­sti­tute Luka Mo­dric fi­nally clinched it with a goal in added time.</p>
    <p>Barca’s Amer­i­can de­fender Sergino Dest lamented that his side were not clin­i­cal enough, adding: “Both sides had chances. Maybe they were sharper with theirs and we missed a few chances to score.”</p>
