    <p>HONG KONG A Hong Kong teenager was yes­ter­day or­dered to spend four months in prison for in­sult­ing China’s na­tional flag and un­law­ful as­sem­bly.</p>
    <p>Tony Chung, 19, who led a nowdis­banded pro-democ­racy group, was con­victed ear­lier this month for throw­ing the Chi­nese flag to the ground out­side Hong Kong’s leg­is­la­ture in May last year. The in­ci­dent hap­pened dur­ing scuf­fles be­tween ri­val sup­port­ers as prodemoc­racy law­mak­ers in­side the leg­is­la­ture tried to pre­vent the pass­ing of a now-aban­doned ex­tra­di­tion Bill.</p>
    <p>Chung is the first pub­lic po­lit­i­cal fig­ure pros­e­cuted un­der the new se­cu­rity law, which Bei­jing de­scribed as a “sword” to re­turn or­der and sta­bil­ity to Hong Kong after seven months of of­ten vi­o­lent pro-democ­racy protests last year.</p>
    <p>He was sen­tenced to three months each for in­sult­ing the na­tional flag and un­law­ful as­sem­bly, and told to serve four months.</p>
    <p>While serv­ing his term, Chung will be wait­ing to stand trial over a charge of se­ces­sion, which could lead to life im­pris­on­ment, ac­cord­ing to the se­cu­rity law Bei­jing im­posed on Hong Kong on June 30.</p>
    <p>He is also fac­ing sep­a­rate charges of money laun­der­ing and con­spir­ing to pub­lish sedi­tious con­tent.</p>
    <p>Chung was ar­rested by plain­clothes po­lice op­po­site the United States con­sulate in Hong Kong in late Oc­to­ber and had been re­manded in cus­tody since.</p>
    <p>Spec­u­la­tion has swirled that the author­i­ties moved on Chung be­cause he was hop­ing to ask for asy­lum at the US con­sulate.</p>
    <p>A grow­ing num­ber of pro-democ­racy ac­tivists across the po­lit­i­cal spec­trum have fled the fi­nan­cial hub since Bei­jing stepped up its crack­down on the city’s protests against China’s au­thor­i­tar­ian rule.</p>
    <p>Un­der the se­cu­rity law, dis­sent­ing speech in­stead of acts can be al­leged of vague yet se­vere of­fences such as “sub­ver­sion” and “col­lu­sion with for­eign forces”.</p>
    <p>The law has also top­pled the le­gal fire­wall be­tween Hong Kong’s in­ter­na­tion­ally recog­nised com­mon l aw j udi­ciary and the opaque jus­tice sys­tem in main­land China by al­low­ing ex­tra­di­tion of sus­pects across the bor­der for trial.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, China’s state TV CGTN said Hong Kong po­lice had put 30 peo­ple who are cur­rently not in the city on its wanted list for sus­pi­cion of breach­ing the se­cu­rity law, in­clud­ing self-ex­iled ac­tivists Ted Hui and Bag­gio Le­ung.</p>
    <p>Prom­i­nent ac­tivists who re­main in Hong Kong – such as Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow – have ei­ther been jailed or face fre­quent ar­rests and mul­ti­ple charges. Jimmy Lai, a pro-democ­racy me­dia mogul who has also been charged un­der the na­tional se­cu­rity law, is un­der house ar­rest. He has been stripped of the means of pub­lic speech – his Twit­ter ac­count in­cluded.</p>
