    <p>In his 61 years, Mr Tan had never been hos­pi­talised – un­til he con­tracted the coro­n­avirus in March and stayed at Changi Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal (CGH) for 44 days.</p>
    <p>The re­tired busi­ness­man, who de­clined to give his full name, had gone to CGH with a fever, dry cough and breath­less­ness. The next day, his con­di­tion wors­ened into acute res­pi­ra­tory dis­tress syn­drome.</p>
    <p>His lungs were in­flamed and starved of oxy­gen, and he had to be in­tu­bated and hooked up to a me­chan­i­cal ven­ti­la­tor for 15 days in the in­ten­sive care unit (ICU).</p>
    <p>Af­ter his lungs got bet­ter and he no longer needed a ven­ti­la­tor, his doc­tor got him a chair so he would not be con­fined to the bed, and news­pa­pers to keep him oc­cu­pied.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan thought the worst was over and that he could re­turn home soon. But when he stood on his feet for the first time in 15 days, he was shocked to learn that he could not bal­ance or walk with­out sup­port.</p>
    <p>“He lost 12kg, and the mus­cles in his legs had shrunk,” said Dr Tay San San, chief and senior con­sul­tant at CGH’s de­part­ment of re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion medicine.</p>
    <p>To get Mr Tan back on his feet, Dr Tay brought in a ro­botic walk­ing aid, called Andago, which is pri­mar­ily used for stroke pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The smart ro­botic de­vice is strapped to a pa­tient, and bears part of his weight as he walks and strength­ens his limbs.</p>
    <p>Led by the pa­tient, it matches his pace and stops when its sen­sors de­tect walls or bar­ri­ers in front of the pa­tient.</p>
    <p>If the pa­tient buck­les, the har­ness will be au­to­mat­i­cally tight­ened so that his knees will not hit the ground. A chair can be placed be­tween the de­vice if he needs to rest.</p>
    <p>A can­is­ter can be strapped to the de­vice as well if a pa­tient needs oxy­gen sup­port.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan was the first of three Covid-19 pa­tients who were sent to the ICU to use Andago.</p>
    <p>CGH rolled out Andago in June last year and it has ben­e­fited 244 pa­tients so far.</p>
    <p>Dr Tay noted that be­ing bed­bound will cause mus­cle loss each day. “The body metabolise­s the mus­cle, and that leads to weak­ness,” she added.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan had to un­dergo 13 days of pul­monary re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion, which in­cludes phys­i­cal ex­er­cise, breath­ing ex­er­cises and education, at the In­te­grated Build­ing at CGH, which houses the hos­pi­tal’s re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion wards.</p>
    <p>While sup­ported by ther­a­pists dur­ing his first phys­io­ther­apy ses­sion, he could walk only 4m be­fore his oxy­gen level plum­meted and he be­came fa­tigued.</p>
    <p>In his first ses­sion with Andago, which was de­vel­oped by a Swiss com­pany, Mr Tan clocked 302m with one break and some oxy­gen sup­port, said Dr Tay.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan told The Straits Times: “When I walked with Andago, I felt lighter (due to the weight sup­port), and I felt more se­cure, and more con­fi­dent. I knew I would not fall or be out of breath.”</p>
    <p>By his sixth ses­sion with the de­vice, he was able to walk 368m with­out oxy­gen sup­port.</p>
    <p>When he was dis­charged in May on Day 44, he was able to in­de­pen­dently walk 142m slowly from the hos­pi­tal to the car.</p>
    <p>“I had al­ready gone through ICU, which was the most dif­fi­cult part. I had to push my­self to walk again and get dis­charged,” said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>He said he did not know how he got Covid-19, and he did not travel.</p>
    <p>While he did not feel much pain while bat­tling the virus in the ICU, it took a toll on his men­tal well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>“Un­able to move and (stuck) with the same sight and sounds of the ICU for two weeks, I felt I was go­ing crazy. I kept hav­ing night­mares and was un­able to sleep,” he said. “I was wor­ried that once I fell asleep, I would not be able to wake up.”</p>
    <p>Now, Mr Tan is in the pink of health, and daily 6km walks and breath­ing ex­er­cises have be­come part of his rou­tine.</p>
    <p>He has also re­sumed more stren­u­ous work­outs such as push-ups, sit-ups and dumb-bell lift­ing.</p>
    <p>I felt I was go­ing crazy. I kept hav­ing night­mares and was un­able to sleep. I was wor­ried that once I fell asleep, I would not be able to wake up.</p>
