    <p>The num­ber of Covid-19 in­fec­tions in the city has con­tin­ued to mount and the gov­ern­ment has moved to sus­pend all cam­pus ac­tiv­i­ties for two weeks, while warn­ing of a pos­si­ble ban on din­ing out.</p>
    <p>The health au­thor­i­ties yes­ter­day said there were 48 new con­firmed cases, bring­ing the to­tal tally to 1,569. Of the new in­fec­tions, 40 are lo­cal and the source for 24 of those are un­known.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, the city recorded 52 cases, of which 41 were lo­cal.</p>
    <p>Dr Chuang Shuk Kwan, head of the com­mu­ni­ca­ble dis­ease branch of the Cen­tre for Health Pro­tec­tion, de­scribed the pro­por­tion of cases where the source was un­known as “ex­tremely wor­ry­ing” and said all dis­tricts were af­fected.</p>
    <p>Dr Chuang said: “For ex­am­ple, half of the re­ported cases to­day, we have no source... And also, we do not have a def­i­nite source.</p>
    <p>“That means there are a lot of un­known sources in the com­mu­nity that can spread eas­ily and they may be asymp­to­matic.”</p>
    <p>In the past week, the city has seen a surge in cases, with lo­cal trans­mis­sions mak­ing up for most of them, trig­ger­ing alarm among health ex­perts who warned of a new wave of in­fec­tions that might be worse than what oc­curred in March.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the Ed­u­ca­tion Bureau or­dered classes and ex­tra-cur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­i­ties to be sus­pended till July 28. It also said schools must wrap up all ex­ams in the next two to three days, fail­ing which they should post­pone or can­cel them.</p>
    <p>These ap­plied to pri­vate in­sti­tu­tions too.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the day, Health Sec­re­tary Sophia Chan told a lo­cal ra­dio pro­gramme that the gov­ern­ment might ban dine-in ser­vices and get eater­ies to switch to take­aways if the sit­u­a­tion wors­ened.</p>
    <p>Her re­marks were im­me­di­ately crit­i­cised by Mr Si­mon Wong, pres­i­dent of the Hong Kong Fed­er­a­tion of Restau­rants and Re­lated Trades, who told RTHK that such a move would be detri­men­tal to busi­ness.</p>
    <p>He said half the 16,000 restau</p>
    <p>From to­day, no din­ing in will be al­lowed at all eater­ies from 6pm to 5am. Only up to four pa­trons will be al­lowed at each ta­ble. The gov­ern­ment has also added a new rule that car­ries a fine of HK$5,000 (S$900) – the manda­tory wear­ing of face masks on pub­lic trans­port...</p>
    <p>All gath­er­ings will be capped at four peo­ple, while venues un­der a dozen cat­e­gories – in­clud­ing gam­ing cen­tres, bars, gyms and cin­e­mas – will shut for seven days.</p>
