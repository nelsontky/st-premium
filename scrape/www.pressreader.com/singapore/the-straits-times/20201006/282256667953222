    <p>Home-grown Sun­seap Group will sup­ply so­lar en­ergy for Face­book oper­a­tions in Sin­ga­pore, in­clud­ing its first cus­tom-built data cen­tre in Asia.</p>
    <p>The deal will help the so­cial me­dia gi­ant reach its goal of sup­port­ing its oper­a­tions in the re­gion with 100 per cent re­new­able en­ergy and re­duc­ing green­house gas emis­sions by 75 per cent, Sun­seap said yes­ter­day. Face­book is one of the world’s largest cor­po­rate pur­chasers of re­new­able en­ergy.</p>
    <p>Sun­seap said this was the firstof-its-kind vir­tual power pur­chase agree­ment be­tween a so­lar leas­ing group and Face­book, and the largest in Sin­ga­pore in terms of so­lar ca­pac­ity un­der such a deal.</p>
    <p>A vir­tual power pur­chase agree­ment in­volves a cus­tomer agree­ing to buy a project’s re­new­able en­ergy for a pre-agreed price. The en­ergy can be pro­duced from a project lo­cated away from a com­pany’s premises but colo­cated on the same grid.</p>
    <p>In this case, the re­new­able en­ergy cred­its that Face­book will re­ceive will come from elec­tric­ity pro­duced by so­lar pan­els from Sun­seap projects on the rooftops of 1,200 Hous­ing Board blocks and 49 gov­ern­ment build­ings across Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>It is ex­pected that these rooftop pan­els could to­tal 100 megawatt-peak (MWp) of so­lar en­ergy when fully com­pleted in 2022, enough to power roughly 114,000 homes.</p>
    <p>Sun­seap pres­i­dent and ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Lawrence Wu said: “We be­lieve vir­tual power pur­chase agree­ments are the way to go for en­ter­prises as they ac­cel­er­ate ef­forts to add re­new­ables to their en­ergy mix.</p>
    <p>“Fur­ther­more, com­pa­nies that are con­strained by a lack of space to in­stall so­lar pan­els or those that re­quire geographic flex­i­bil­ity will find a vir­tual con­tract em­i­nently suit­able for their needs.”</p>
    <p>The lo­cal com­pany has a pipe­line of projects i n Aus­tralia, China, Tai­wan, Ja­pan and other parts of South-east Asia, and com­mis­sioned a 168 MWp so­lar farm in Viet­nam last year.</p>
    <p>Sun­seap has over 300 MWp of so­lar en­ergy projects con­tracted here, of which 168 MWp have been com­pleted on more than 1,500 build­ings.</p>
