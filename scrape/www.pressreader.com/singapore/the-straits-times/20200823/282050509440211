    <p>NEW YORK • Since last year, Amay Sheth, a 26-year-old start-up founder in New York City, has been schem­ing to shave time off his vis­its to his par­ents and go­ing less of­ten. The rea­son: He can­not wait to get home to his Tonal, a US$2,995 (S$4,108) smart strength-train­ing de­vice that packs a weight room’s worth of equip­ment in one ma­chine that is the size of a poster.</p>
    <p>“I hate be­ing apart from it,” said Sheth, who ad­mit­ted to be­ing ob­sessed with con­stantly smash­ing his strength score, which rises if he lifts a bit heav­ier or does more reps.</p>
    <p>So ob­sessed that he re­cently bought a sec­ond Tonal for his par­ents’ house, though there is an 11-week wait for de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>If that sounds like the scram­ble for Peloton, the In­ter­net-con­nected sta­tion­ary bike that has been a run­away sen­sa­tion in the pan­demic, that is ex­actly what Tonal and its com­peti­tors are hop­ing for: to make at-home strength train­ing as pop­u­lar as Peloton.</p>
    <p>These would-be bar­bell jug­ger­nauts have some heavy lift­ing to do, though. Strength train­ing has al­ways had its ad­her­ents but has never achieved the mass de­vo­tion of car­dio forms like Jazzer­cise, Tae Bo and, more re­cently, spin­ning.</p>
    <p>A 2016 Na­tional Health In­ter­view Sur­vey – the most re­cent avail­able – found that roughly half the pop­u­la­tion meets the stan­dard for aer­o­bic ex­er­cise set by the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion (150 min­utes a week). But that just 21.9 per cent of women and 30 per cent of men meet guide­lines for “mus­cle strength­en­ing” (two ses­sions a week).</p>
    <p>Weight rooms can be in­tim­i­dat­ing, with lit­tle that is in­tu­itive about the equip­ment, and a fairly daunt­ing ar­ray can be re­quired for lift­ing at home. Nor does it help that aer­o­bic ex­er­cise is con­sid­ered the gold stan­dard for calo­rie burn­ing.</p>
    <p>Some women seek­ing to slim down er­ro­neously fear that lift­ing will cause bulk, but ac­tu­ally the more mus­cle you have, the more calo­ries you burn, said Michele Ol­son, a se­nior clin­i­cal pro­fes­sor of sport science at Hunt­ing­don Col­lege in Alabama and a fel­low of the Amer­i­can Col­lege of Sports Medicine. By do­ing car­dio, “most of us feel we’ve checked off our fit­ness for the day or week,” she said.</p>
    <p>One big ad­vance of this new breed of de­vices is that, through a com­bi­na­tion of ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, cam­eras and mo­tion sen­sors, they can ac­tu­ally teach you how to lift. They mon­i­tor your speed, telling you to “lower your­self down slower, and with con­trol” dur­ing those curtsy lunges you tried to blast through, and point out er­rors in your form like “your knees are over your toes” for a squat.</p>
    <p>Per­sonal train­ing is in­te­gral to all the machines: Tonal; Tempo, which came to mar­ket in Fe­bru­ary priced at US$1,995; and Forme Life, which costs $4,295.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been run­ning and cy­cling since we were kids, and when you take a stu­dio class, the teach­ers are usu­ally there to mo­ti­vate us more than teach us,” said Aly Orady, 42, Tonal’s founder. “But strength train­ing is ac­tu­ally really hard. That’s why per­sonal train­ers have jobs.”</p>
    <p>Moawia Eldeeb, 27, founder of</p>
    <p>Tempo and a cer­ti­fied per­sonal trainer, said his ma­chine was an im­prove­ment on a trainer at the gym be­cause of the data it of­fers.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore you can lift another five pounds, there’s a lot of in­ter­est­ing data points that hap­pen on the jour­ney,” said Eldeeb.</p>
    <p>In­stead of some­one telling you that your form looks bet­ter, Tempo – a free-stand­ing easel-shaped cab­i­net with a 42-inch screen – may show you, say, ex­actly how much deeper your squat has be­come.</p>
    <p>Tonal is a screen with weighted ca­bles tucked be­hind it; be­cause it uses elec­tro­mag­netic re­sis­tance, not phys­i­cal weights, to gen­er­ate force, it can act as a spot­ter, au­to­mat­i­cally de­creas­ing weight when it senses a user is strug­gling.</p>
    <p>Nearly 50 per cent of buy­ers are women, the founders say. And buy­ers of these de­vices, at least so far, seem to be peo­ple who al­ready know how to lift weights, not peo­ple who first want to learn.</p>
    <p>“The Tonal paid for it­self in four months,” said Joina Liao, 43, of San Fran­cisco. She said her re­sults from her per­sonal trainer, who charged US$100 per ses­sion, were lim­ited by how of­ten she could af­ford him, but she can do Tonal ses­sions four times a week.</p>
    <p>Liao has had a Peloton bike since 2015 but has ig­nored it since she bought the Tonal.</p>
    <p>“If you take a dumb­bell class in Peloton, you pick up the same weight as you’ve al­ways done,” she said. “With the AI in Tonal, once you do two sets, it goes up in one­pound in­cre­ments. It really pushes you to im­prove with­out you putting much thought into it.”</p>
    <p>Niket Desai, 33, who works at an au­to­mated time-sheet start-up in San Fran­cisco, bought a Tempo in Jan­uary after he re­alised he was spend­ing US$10,000 a year on Barry’s Boot­camp classes.</p>
    <p>He briefly de­bated a Peloton bike but de­cided he could mo­ti­vate him­self to do car­dio; whereas he needed some help with the weight train­ing. He rated t he Tempo classes and chal­lenges as “80 per cent of the qual­ity of Barry’s at one­tenth of the cost”.</p>
    <p>He said that see­ing his friends’ faces on the l eader board and watch­ing their rep counts and weight counts go up spurs him to use the ma­chine. Desai lives in a small apart­ment; the Tempo cab­i­net takes up a chunk of his liv­ing room, but its de­sign, he said, “makes it look like it be­longs there”.</p>
    <p>Tonal and Forme – which look like a big screen and a mir­ror, re­spec­tively – also do not scream “gym”.</p>
