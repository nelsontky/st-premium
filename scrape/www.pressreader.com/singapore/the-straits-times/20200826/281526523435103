    <p>Res­cue work­ers car­ry­ing four-year-old Mo­hammed Bangi af­ter he was res­cued from the rub­ble at the site of a col­lapsed five-storey build­ing in Ma­had in Raigad district in In­dia yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>At least five peo­ple were killed and around 14 un­ac­counted for fol­low­ing the dis­as­ter on Monday, in the Ma­had in­dus­trial town about 165km south of Mum­bai, in the western state of Ma­ha­rash­tra.</p>
    <p>Dis­traught rel­a­tives shouted out the names of miss­ing loved ones yes­ter­day, and oth­ers combed through warped tin sheets, man­gled me­tal rods and bro­ken con­crete look­ing for signs of life.</p>
    <p>The cause of the dis­as­ter has not been de­ter­mined. But build­ing col­lapses are com­mon es­pe­cially dur­ing the mon­soon sea­son, as con­struc­tion is of­ten shoddy.</p>
    <p>MA­HAD (In­dia) • Res­cuers in In­dia pulled a four-year-old boy from the rub­ble of a col­lapsed build­ing to loud cheers yes­ter­day, hours af­ter the five-storey apart­ment block came down “like a house of cards” and killed at least 11 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The emer­gency ser­vices have found 60 peo­ple alive, but there are still sev­eral un­ac­counted for fol­low­ing the dis­as­ter on Monday evening in Ma­had, an in­dus­trial town about 165km south of Mum­bai.</p>
    <p>As an am­bu­lance crew rushed the child Mo­hammed Bangi from the dis­as­ter site, dis­traught rel­a­tives shouted out the names of miss­ing loved ones, while some combed through warped tin sheets, man­gled me­tal rods and bro­ken con­crete look­ing for signs of life. Three dis­as­ter-re­sponse teams and snif­fer dogs worked through the night look­ing for sur­vivors.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials said at least 11 peo­ple had died, while the more se­ri­ously in­jured were ad­mit­ted to hos­pi­tal. As the search for sur­vivors con­tin­ued in the rain, res­cue teams tried to re­move or sta­bilise sec­tions of the build­ing in dan­ger of a fresh col­lapse.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials said many res­i­dents of the 47 flats in the build­ing were spared be­cause they had al­ready left town to es­cape the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The cause of the ac­ci­dent was not im­me­di­ately clear, but build­ing col­lapses are com­mon dur­ing In­dia’s June-Septem­ber mon­soon, with old and rick­ety struc­tures buck­ling af­ter days of non-stop rain.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a po­lice of­fi­cial, le­gal ac­tion had been ini­ti­ated against the build­ing’s con­trac­tor, Yunus Shaikh, and the ar­chi­tect.</p>
    <p>Ma­had leg­is­la­tor Bharat Go­gawale said that some of the build­ing’s oc­cu­pants ap­peared to have been out shop­ping when the ac­ci­dent oc­curred at around 7pm. Oth­ers had left the town al­to­gether, pre­fer­ring to wait out the pan­demic in their home vil­lages.</p>
    <p>“Many fam­i­lies were not re­sid­ing in the build­ing as they went to their na­tive places due to the coronaviru­s-in­duced lock­down,” district of­fi­cial Nidhi Choud­hari told the Press Trust of In­dia.</p>
    <p>Mr Mustafa Chafekar, a res­i­dent who had been on home quar­an­tine af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for the virus, told the Mum­bai Mir­ror that he and his fam­ily of five ini­tially thought they were ex­pe­ri­enc­ing an earth­quake. “We ran down im­me­di­ately... The whole (struc­ture) col­lapsed right in front of us,” the 39-year-old said of their es­cape.</p>
    <p>He said res­i­dents had pre­vi­ously com­plained to the builders about the con­di­tion of the block.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal politi­cian Manik Moti­ram</p>
    <p>Jag­tap told TV9 Marathi that the struc­ture was 10 years old and built on “weak” foun­da­tions. “It fell like a house of cards,” Mr Jag­tap said.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi tweeted that he was “sad­dened”.</p>
    <p>“My thoughts are with the fam­i­lies of those who lost their dear ones. I pray the in­jured re­cover soon,” he said.</p>
    <p>The death toll from mon­soon-re­lated dis­as­ters this year has topped 1,200, in­clud­ing more than 800 in In­dia. The build­ing col­lapse is a fur­ther blow to the state of Ma­ha­rash­tra, al­ready hit hard by the coronaviru­s, with the re­gion ac­count­ing for over a fifth of In­dia’s more than three mil­lion in­fec­tions.</p>
