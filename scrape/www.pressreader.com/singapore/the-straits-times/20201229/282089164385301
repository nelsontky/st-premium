    <p>A staff mem­ber of the In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health (IMH) re­peat­edly abused the trust placed in him when he mo­lested pa­tients and in­sulted his col­leagues’ mod­esty at his work­place. He even recorded videos of him­self mo­lest­ing his vic­tims. The 36-year-old Sin­ga­porean also took up­skirt videos, in­clud­ing at Can­berra MRT sta­tion.</p>
    <p>He is no longer work­ing at IMH and his de­tails can­not be re­vealed ow­ing to a gag or­der to pro­tect the vic­tims’ iden­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>He was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to four years, nine months and a week’s jail with 10 strokes of the cane after plead­ing guilty to four counts of in­sult­ing a woman’s mod­esty. He also ad­mit­ted to two counts each of mo­lesta­tion and voyeurism. Thirty-four other charges for sim­i­lar of­fences were con­sid­ered dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>He was at work on Sept 6 last year when he saw a 25-year-old fe­male pa­tient alone in a room, re­strained in a hospi­tal bed. He mo­lested the woman and recorded a video of him­self com­mit­ting the of­fence.</p>
    <p>The court heard that he com­mit­ted sim­i­lar acts against a 29-year-old fe­male pa­tient on Nov 21 last year. He also tar­geted his col­leagues and recorded videos of them while they were chang­ing in­side cu­bi­cles late last year.</p>
    <p>He also recorded an up­skirt video of a col­league while she was per­form­ing her rounds in a ward last De­cem­ber, the court heard.</p>
    <p>On sep­a­rate oc­ca­sions in Fe­bru­ary this year, the man also used his mo­bile phone to record videos of two fe­male pa­tients while they were show­er­ing.</p>
    <p>His of­fences came to light on March 2 this year. A 26-year-old woman was go­ing up an es­ca­la­tor at Can­berra MRT sta­tion at around 7.40am that day when she felt some­thing touch­ing her calf.</p>
    <p>She turned around and saw the man stand­ing be­hind her with a phone in his left hand. The woman lodged a po­lice re­port the same morn­ing and of­fi­cers ar­rested him at IMH two days later.</p>
    <p>They seized two mo­bile phones from him and the in­crim­i­nat­ing videos were found on the de­vices fol­low­ing a foren­sic in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, IMH said it dis­missed the man on March 11. “IMH takes a se­ri­ous view of the in­ci­dent and staff con­duct, and had fully co­op­er­ated with the po­lice in their in­ves­ti­ga­tions,” its spokesman said. “We had also reached out to the af­fected staff and pa­tients, ad­dressed their con­cerns, and pro­vided sup­port to them.”</p>
    <p>It added: “We have re­minded all staff to ad­here to the hospi­tal’s code of con­duct. We also fur­ther tight­ened our pro­to­col for staff work­ing in mixed­gen­der wards.”</p>
