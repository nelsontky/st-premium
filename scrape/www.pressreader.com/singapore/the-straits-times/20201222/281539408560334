    <p>US law­mak­ers agreed on a nearly US$900 bil­lion (S$1.2 tril­lion) Covid-19 re­lief pack­age for mil­lions of Amer­i­cans on Sun­day, as the United States bat­tles the world’s largest coro­n­avirus out­break. The pack­age in­cludes aid for vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion and lo­gis­tics, ex­tra ben­e­fits for the job­less and a new round of stim­u­lus cheques.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON United States law­mak­ers on Sun­day agreed on a nearly US$900 bil­lion (S$1.2 tril­lion) Covid-19 re­lief pack­age for mil­lions of Amer­i­cans, in a deal that fol­lows months of wran­gling and comes as the na­tion bat­tles the world’s largest coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>The pack­age in­cludes aid for vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion and lo­gis­tics, ex­tra job­less ben­e­fits of US$300 per week and a new round of US$600 stim­u­lus cheques – half the amount pro­vided in cheques distribute­d in March un­der the Cares Act.</p>
    <p>Months of par­ti­san de­bate and fin­ger-point­ing, as well as last-minute ne­go­ti­a­tions, cul­mi­nated in a deal that law­mak­ers said they hoped to for­mally ap­prove by yes­ter­day US time.</p>
    <p>Talks had taken place amid a highly con­tentious cam­paign for the US pres­i­dency and Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s sub­se­quent re­fusal to con­cede de­feat to Demo­crat Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>“We’ve agreed to a pack­age of nearly US$900 bil­lion. It is packed with tar­geted poli­cies to help strug­gling Amer­i­cans who have al­ready waited too long,” Repub­li­can Se­nate Ma­jor­ity Leader Mitch McCon­nell said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Se­nate Mi­nor­ity Leader Chuck Schumer con­firmed that an agree­ment had been reached with Repub­li­cans and the White House on a deal that “de­liv­ers ur­gently needed funds to save the lives and liveli­hoods of the Amer­i­can peo­ple as the virus ac­cel­er­ates”.</p>
    <p>The deal also con­tains US$25 bil­lion in hous­ing aid to pre­vent evic­tions and nearly US$100 bil­lion to help schools and child­care fa­cil­i­ties re­open, a state­ment from Ms Pelosi and Mr Schumer said.</p>
    <p>Congress was work­ing un­der a dead­line of mid­night on Sun­day, need­ing to reach con­sen­sus to avoid a gov­ern­ment shut­down.</p>
    <p>No. 2 House Demo­crat Steny Hoyer said he ex­pected the deal to pass by yes­ter­day US time and then head to the Se­nate.</p>
    <p>That meant it re­quired pas­sage of a stop­gap mea­sure – which was signed by Mr Trump late on Sun­day – to keep the fed­eral gov­ern­ment funded an ex­tra 24 hours and avert a shut­down.</p>
    <p>The House and Se­nate ap­proved the stop­gap mea­sure ear­lier on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“The House will move swiftly to pass this leg­is­la­tion im­me­di­ately, so it can quickly be sent to the Se­nate and then to the Pres­i­dent’s desk for his sig­na­ture,” Mr Schumer and Ms Pelosi said in the state­ment. “With the hor­ri­fy­ing ac­cel­er­a­tion of daily in­fec­tions and deaths, there is no time to waste.”</p>
    <p>In the wake of the deal, Pres­i­dent-elect Bi­den – who has promised to pass an­other cash in­jec­tion when he takes of­fice next month – wel­comed the agree­ment but said more will need to be done.</p>
    <p>“Im­me­di­ately, start­ing in the new year, Congress will need to get to work on sup­port for our Covid-19 plan, for sup­port to strug­gling fam­i­lies and in­vest­ments in jobs and eco­nomic re­cov­ery,” he said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Democrats and Repub­li­cans have traded blame for months over the fail­ure to reach a deal on this sec­ond re­lief plan – and con­tin­ued to do so even af­ter the deal was agreed on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>As the pan­demic takes a record toll in US cases and deaths, the econ­omy has been gravely bat­tered, with job­less num­bers ris­ing in the past two weeks.</p>
