    <p>Arham Tal­sa­nia was not yet three years of age when he could tell one com­puter op­er­at­ing sys­tem from an­other. Soon enough, he was play­ing logic-based games on the com­puter and other gad­gets that his father Om Tal­sa­nia, a soft­ware engi­neer, would have ly­ing around in the house in Ahmed­abad.</p>
    <p>Quick to spot his son’s nat­u­ral affin­ity for tech and prob­lem-solv­ing, Mr Tal­sa­nia be­gan teach­ing Arham ba­sic cod­ing con­cepts. All this even be­fore the boy turned five. “It was sur­pris­ing that he was able to pick up con­cepts at such a young age,” said the proud father.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, a day short of turn­ing seven, Arham cleared a Mi­crosoft Tech­nol­ogy As­so­ci­ate cer­tifi­cate course in Python – a pro­gram­ming lan­guage – earn­ing him­self a men­tion in the Guin­ness World Records as the “youngest com­puter pro­gram­mer”.</p>
    <p>The Tal­sa­nias re­ceived Arham’s cer­tifi­cate last month, prompt­ing an ex­pected gush of me­dia coverage in a coun­try that has long had a starry-eyed af­fair with soft­ware engi­neers. Rare is the In­dian par­ent who does not dream of his child as the next Sun­dar Pichai, the In­di­ano­ri­gin chief ex­ec­u­tive of Google.</p>
    <p>A host of In­dian firms have cashed in on that hope in re­cent years, of­fer­ing cod­ing classes to chil­dren as young as those in kinder­garten. The craze climbed to new heights amid the pan­demic – with grow­ing ac­cep­tance of on­line learn­ing and par­ents seek­ing var­i­ous ways to keep their chil­dren en­gaged, while be­ing re­stricted from schools and their friends.</p>
    <p>“Coders hi hai the hope of gen­er­a­tions... cod­ing seekho, duniya badlo,” sing chil­dren in uni­son in an ad, which trans­lates to “coders are the hope of gen­er­a­tions... learn cod­ing, change the world”. WhiteHat Jr, an edtech start-up be­hind the ad that started run­ning last month, has ag­gres­sively pro­moted its on­line cod­ing classes.</p>
    <p>Noida-based tech­nol­ogy pro­fes­sional Puneet Arora en­rolled his nine-year-old son, Hrid­haan, for WhiteHat Jr’s on­line cod­ing classes in June. He did so af­ter the boy saw one of his cousins, who is also nine, de­velop a game us­ing ba­sic cod­ing skills and ex­pressed an in­ter­est in do­ing some­thing sim­i­lar.</p>
    <p>“Bet­ter than just sit­ting around, why not learn some­thing new that is of in­ter­est?” said Mr Arora. “Cod­ing also in­vokes log­i­cal think­ing, so that was an­other rea­son to opt for these classes.”</p>
    <p>His son spends two hours ev­ery week at­tend­ing the cod­ing classes, but bet­ter this than time in front of</p>
    <p>PREY­ING ON IN­SE­CU­RI­TIES</p>
    <p>the tele­vi­sion set, Mr Arora said.</p>
    <p>Among the many com­pa­nies that re­cently launched on­line cod­ing classes is Tinkerly, a Jaipur­based firm that com­ple­ments its lessons with science, tech­nol­ogy, en­gi­neer­ing and maths kits that are shipped to chil­dren. It went on­line in July, prompted by the pan­demic, of­fer­ing its classes to chil­dren start­ing from Grade 1 and has seen par­tic­i­pa­tion grow by as much as 30 per cent ev­ery month.</p>
    <p>Tinkerly co-founder and CEO Sharad Bansal de­scribed cod­ing, which in­volves writ­ing a set of com­mands for a com­puter, as a process that en­hances logic de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“If these skills are in­tro­duced in a more fun and en­ter­tain­ing man­ner at an early stage, it might cre­ate a good learn­ing habit,” he said, adding that the child may not be­come a coder later in life, but at least now the “mo­bile phone or a com­puter is seen in an an­gle dif­fer­ent from just games”.</p>
    <p>Even gov­ern­ments have hitched onto the cod­ing band­wagon.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral gov­ern­ment’s Na­tional Ed­u­ca­tion Pol­icy re­leased this year identifies math­e­mat­i­cal and com­pu­ta­tional think­ing as key skills re­quired for the fu­ture and rec­om­mends in­tro­duc­ing cod­ing in middle school.</p>
    <p>The Delhi gov­ern­ment has also ac­tively pro­moted cod­ing, run­ning an ad last week that reads: “Delhi gov­ern­ment school stu­dents are cod­ing their way to a bright fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>As edtech firms cash in on In­dian middle-class in­se­cu­ri­ties, a new rat race has emerged among par­ents wor­ried about their chil­dren’s fu­tures. “If my child has not learnt cod­ing, he or she is hand­i­capped and will get left be­hind in the race. These are the in­se­cu­ri­ties they try to build on,” said Mr Arvind Gupta, a Pune-based science pop­u­lariser who has worked for many years to de­velop prob­lem-solv­ing skills among school­child­ren us­ing sci­en­tific ex­per­i­ments.</p>
    <p>Last month, WhiteHat Jr was hauled up by the Ad­ver­tis­ing Stan­dards Coun­cil of In­dia and asked to pull down some of its ads for mak­ing tall claims. One of its re­cent tele­vi­sion com­mer­cials was widely crit­i­cised on so­cial me­dia for de­pict­ing cod­ing as the magic bul­let that would en­able young chil­dren to de­velop apps that po­ten­tial in­vestors would fight over.</p>
    <p>The ob­ses­sion with cod­ing, driven by slick and in­ces­sant ads, has also over­shad­owed flaws in In­dia’s school ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem, which does lit­tle to pro­mote in­quis­i­tive think­ing or prob­lem-solv­ing skills through ba­sic science.</p>
    <p>“In most of our schools, chil­dren don’t have ac­cess to good labs... Not that skills such as cod­ing and ro­bot­ics are un­nec­es­sary, but be­fore we go there, let’s de­velop our ba­sic in­fra­struc­ture where chil­dren can do ex­per­i­ments and ask ques­tions,” Mr Gupta told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>If my child has not learnt cod­ing, he or she is hand­i­capped and will get left be­hind in the race. These are the in­se­cu­ri­ties they try to build on.</p>
