    <p>More par­ents with young chil­dren will pay less for their chil­dren’s pre-school ed­u­ca­tion from next year, with more cen­tres join­ing a gov­ern­ment-funded scheme to lower fees for fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 324 child­care cen­tres, run by 29 op­er­a­tors or con­sor­tia, have been ap­pointed to a new round of the part­ner op­er­a­tor scheme, which starts in Jan­uary next year.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli an­nounced yes­ter­day that the num­ber of cen­tres in this sec­ond term of the scheme is 30 per cent more than those in the cur­rent term.</p>
    <p>More than 27,000 Sin­ga­porean chil­dren are ex­pected to ben­e­fit from next year, com­pared with 20,000 in the cur­rent term.</p>
    <p>The ex­pan­sion of the part­ner op­er­a­tor scheme comes af­ter the Gov­ern­ment said last year that it would be in­creas­ing the pro­por­tion of gov­ern­ment-sup­ported pre-school places to 80 per cent by 2025, up from 50 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 23 part­ner op­er­a­tors run­ning 250 cen­tres were ap­pointed un­der the first term, which be­gan in 2016 and will come to an end next month.</p>
    <p>Pre-schools are also al­lowed to ap­ply as a con­sor­tium, so op­er­a­tors of dif­fer­ent pre-schools un­der the same fran­chise, for in­stance, can come to­gether to ap­ply.</p>
    <p>Part­ner op­er­a­tors get gov­ern­ment fund­ing to keep fees low, and have to ad­here to the fee cap. Cur­rent op­er­a­tors in­clude Busy Bees, Star Learn­ers and Carpe Diem.</p>
    <p>For cen­tres un­der the sec­ond term, the max­i­mum fee that part­ner op­er­a­tors can charge for full­day child­care ser­vices will be set at $760 monthly, $40 lower than the cur­rent fee cap of $800.</p>
    <p>For full-day in­fant care ser­vices, the amount is set at $1,330 monthly, $70 cheaper than the cur­rent $1,400 per month.</p>
    <p>Both fees are not in­clu­sive of goods and ser­vices tax.</p>
    <p>In a press state­ment yes­ter­day, the Early Child­hood De­vel­op­ment Agency (ECDA) said the op­er­a­tors com­prise a mix of com­mer­cial and not-for-profit types, with cen­tres in lo­ca­tions across Sin­ga­pore, pro­vid­ing choice for par­ents.</p>
    <p>Seven op­er­a­tors, such as Green­land Child­care and Kin­der­land, are new to the scheme. Both have seven and 14 cen­tres, re­spec­tively, that will be part of the new term.</p>
    <p>Other ad­di­tions in­clude faith­based op­er­a­tors such as Catholic Preschool Ed­u­ca­tion (Sin­ga­pore), with three cen­tres, and Lit­tle Seeds, with 11 cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Lit­tle Seeds Preschool is the child­care arm of St James’ Preschool Ser­vices (Angli­can).</p>
    <p>Its cen­tres, most of which charge $790 or more for full-day child­care, will be­come more af­ford­able with the fee caps.</p>
    <p>Mr An­drew Tay, chief ex­ec­u­tive of St James’ Preschool Ser­vices (Angli­can), said: “Over the next few years, we will con­tinue to in­vest in our staff, fo­cus­ing on train­ing and de­vel­op­ing ca­reer road maps for them. We be­lieve that this en­hanced pro­fes­sional de­vel­op­ment of staff will have a pos­i­tive im­pact on our chil­dren’s learn­ing.”</p>
    <p>Ms Rabi­atul Adawiyah, chief de­vel­op­ment of­fi­cer of Busy Bees, an ex­ist­ing part­ner op­er­a­tor which has been re­newed for the sec­ond term, said two more cen­tres are now part of the scheme, bring­ing the to­tal to 18.</p>
    <p>This means that by the middle of next year, about 2,600 chil­dren will ben­e­fit from the lower fees at these cen­tres, up from the cur­rent 2,100.</p>
    <p>She added that the gov­ern­ment sup­port will go to­wards in­vest­ing in the pro­fes­sional de­vel­op­ment of teach­ers, for in­stance, in earn­ing a rel­e­vant de­gree qual­i­fi­ca­tion. The fund­ing will also help in im­prov­ing cur­ricu­lum re­sources and of­fer­ing more pro­grammes for chil­dren with de­vel­op­men­tal needs.</p>
    <p>ECDA had eval­u­ated the ap­pli­ca­tions of 52 pre-school op­er­a­tors to be part of the scheme.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a visit to Busy Bees’ Learn­ing Vi­sion @ In­ter­local preschool in Pasir Pan­jang yes­ter­day, Mr Masa­gos said the fac­tors in choos­ing part­ner op­er­a­tors were qual­ity, fol­lowed by ac­ces­si­bil­ity and af­ford­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>“The ex­ist­ing op­er­a­tors also have to show that they have been de­liv­er­ing on qual­ity, and that in­cludes train­ing teach­ers, up­lift­ing their qual­i­fi­ca­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>ECDA said that in the medium term, full-day pre-school ex­penses should be brought down to around $300 a month, which is about the same as the cost of pri­mary school plus af­ter-school stu­dent care be­fore means-tested sub­si­dies.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the Gov­ern­ment’s an­nual spend­ing on the early child­hood sec­tor is ex­pected to more than dou­ble over the next few years, from around $1 bil­lion in 2018.</p>
