    <p>QI am the only daugh­ter of a sin­gle mother and I am cur­rently in sec­ondary school. As my mum has to work to pro­vide for the two of us, she of­ten comes home late and we hardly get to talk.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, I ac­ci­den­tally up­turned a big bot­tle of prickly heat pow­der, not know­ing it was open, and a whole lot of it got into one of my eyes.</p>
    <p>I cried out in pain to my mum, who was then in the room with me. Fi­nally came a</p>
    <p>“What?!!” from my mother, who sounded re­ally an­noyed.</p>
    <p>I yelled that I had prickly heat pow­der in my eye.</p>
    <p>“Stupid, who asked you to play with pow­der any­way?” she shot back. That even­tu­ally es­ca­lated into an ar­gu­ment.</p>
    <p>“Any­way, are you done? Go do your work. Go and study and do your work, your re­sults are hor­ren­dous. Look at your cousin, so smart, made it to ACS</p>
    <p>(I) and ex­celling there. Look at you, play­ing all day long. I’ve never seen such bad re­sults in my life – so dis­ap­point­ing, so em­bar­rass­ing. Oh my gosh, you’re so stupid.”</p>
    <p>Like re­ally, thanks a lot, mum.</p>
    <p>I tried to do well af­ter my grades slipped. I tried my best, but she didn’t help me like she used to. Who am I go­ing to rely on now? At least she should let me talk to some­one, some peo­ple, my friends? Teach­ers?</p>
    <p>I’m not even al­lowed to talk to my dad. Great. Phys­i­cally dis­tant from dad, men­tally dis­tant from mum. Isn’t that equal to hav­ing no par­ents?</p>
    <p>I do hope that some­one could help me and my mum un­der­stand each other.</p>
    <p>Thanks for your time. I re­ally ap­pre­ci­ate it. Aisha</p>
    <p>A I am very sorry to hear about your dif­fi­cult and emo­tion­ally drain­ing ex­pe­ri­ences with your mother. It is only nat­u­ral for you to want to vent your frus­tra­tions.</p>
    <p>Her sin­gle-par­ent sit­u­a­tion is no ex­cuse for her ne­glect of your emo­tional needs. On the other hand, you as her only child will also need to ac­knowl­edge that as a sin­gle par­ent, her role is much more de­mand­ing in that she has to jug­gle many men­tal and emo­tional tasks to bal­ance the nur­tur­ing, dis­ci­plin­ing and phys­i­cal needs of your fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Some­times, th­ese var­i­ous roles that she has to take on can be over­whelm­ing and take their toll on her.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, it’s sad but true that there are just as many in­ef­fec­tive par­ents as there are many mis­un­der­stood teenagers to­day.</p>
    <p>In­ef­fec­tive par­ents are too self-ab­sorbed, think­ing their prob­lems are more over­whelm­ing than your prob­lems. As a re­sult, they as­sume you will un­der­stand them with­out com­mu­ni­cat­ing to you their needs, so that you can part­ner them in some of the house­hold re­spon­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Even though th­ese par­ents are not trained in psy­chol­ogy, they ap­pear to use un­usual meth­ods to force their chil­dren into do­ing things and meet­ing their ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>Hence the re­peated com­par­isons to oth­ers and the use of de­mor­al­is­ing words such as “stupid”, “use­less”, “so dumb” and “un­der­achiever”.</p>
    <p>In or­der to move for­ward, I won­der if you can learn to let go of some of the bat­tles you have with your mother.</p>
    <p>Both of you could do with some coun­selling. A third party or ex­pe­ri­enced coun­sel­lor can me­di­ate your dif­fer­ences and come up with con­struc­tive ar­range­ments so that both of you can work as a team in this fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Try not to wait too long to get help so that the misun­der­stand­ings will not fester and cre­ate a big­ger bar­rier.</p>
    <p>• An­swered by Dr Carol Bal­hetchet, PhD, a clin­i­cal psy­chol­o­gist, for The Straits Times. This ex­cerpt first ap­peared in Dr Delin­quent: A Guide To De­cod­ing The Teenage Years. The book is avail­able at stbooks.sg</p>
