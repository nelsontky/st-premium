    <p>Sin­ga­pore start-ups in sec­tors such as tech­nol­ogy and sus­tain­abil­ity have caught the eye of in­vestors amid the pan­demic, with some op­er­a­tors beef­ing up their fund­ing.</p>
    <p>Plant-based meat start-up Karana closed US$1.7 mil­lion (S$2.3 mil­lion) in seed fund­ing last month, while dig­i­tal wealth man­age­ment plat­form StashAway raised US$16 mil­lion in a re­cent fund­ing round.</p>
    <p>But a key chal­lenge is that in­vestors have turned cau­tious amid the eco­nomic un­cer­tainty. “In­vestors are still ac­tive but pick­ier in terms of the cri­te­ria and as­sess­ment,” said Pro­fes­sor Freddy Boey, deputy pres­i­dent of in­no­va­tion and en­ter­prise at the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>These are tough times to be run­ning a busi­ness but the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has cre­ated op­por­tu­ni­ties across the econ­omy that are tailor-made for nim­ble Sin­ga­pore start-ups that can at­tract cap­i­tal and utilise sup­port from the pri­vate and public sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Sec­tors such as tech­nol­ogy and sus­tain­abil­ity have gen­er­ated huge po­ten­tial, with some new op­er­a­tors beef­ing up their fund­ing to take ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>Last month, plant-based meat start-up Karana closed US$1.7 mil­lion (S$2.3 mil­lion) in seed fund­ing, while dig­i­tal wealth man­age­ment plat­form StashAway raised US$16 mil­lion in a re­cent fund­ing round.</p>
    <p>With en­hance­ments to the Startup SG Founder pro­gramme an­nounced ear­lier this week, bud­ding en­trepreneur­s will get a fur­ther boost.</p>
    <p>En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore di­rec­tor for start-up devel­op­ment Lim Seow Hui noted that while all sec­tors have been dis­rupted by the pan­demic, new trends and op­por­tu­ni­ties in the near and long term have been cre­ated.</p>
    <p>That is where start-ups can play a key role given their abil­ity to drive in­no­va­tion, she said, stress­ing the need to keep the en­trepreneur­ship ecosys­tem con­ducive for their con­tin­ued devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>500 Star­tups gen­eral part­ner Vishal Har­nal pointed out that lead­ing start-ups made their break­throughs dur­ing eco­nomic slow­downs, cit­ing the likes of What­sApp and Uber, which were founded after the 2008 global fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>In­dus­tries such as health tech­nol­ogy, ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing and ed­u­ca­tion tech have caught the eye dur­ing the pan­demic with their in­no­va­tions, said Tribe Ac­cel­er­a­tor man­ag­ing part­ner Ng Yi Ming.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Freddy Boey, deputy pres­i­dent of in­no­va­tion and en­ter­prise at the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore, said in­vestors may be more wary of start-ups of­fer­ing travel- or avi­a­tion-re­lated so­lu­tions for now, while dig­i­tal so­lu­tions and ur­ban farm­ing are gain­ing in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has changed the risk dy­nam­ics for start-ups and in­dus­try, he said, adding: “In­vestors are still ac­tive but pick­ier in terms of the cri­te­ria and as­sess­ment – the qual­ity of teams, type of prod­ucts and ser­vices, and if busi­ness mod­els have proven to be re­silient dur­ing and after the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Ms Lim said the key con­cerns for start-ups amid the pan­demic in­clude the loss of rev­enue and re­duced cash flow due to weaker de­mand and a longer sales cy­cle, which is es­pe­cially acute for firms serv­ing sec­tors such as travel and hos­pi­tal­ity, the arts and en­ter­tain­ment.</p>
    <p>“It has be­come crit­i­cal to re­bal­ance cash burn rates, trim nonessen­tial costs and build new ways to gen­er­ate rev­enue for long-term sus­tain­abil­ity,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Huang Shao-ning, part­ner at an­gel in­vestor net­work An­gelCen­tral, said in­vestors have gen­er­ally been more cau­tious in re­cent months given the muddy eco­nomic wa­ters, help­ing to send val­u­a­tions down by about 20 per cent to 30 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ms Teodora Ge­orgieva, pro­gramme di­rec­tor at ac­cel­er­a­tor Scaler8, said: “With the prospect of</p>
    <p>In­vestors are still ac­tive but pick­ier in terms of the cri­te­ria and as­sess­ment – the qual­ity of teams, type of prod­ucts and ser­vices, and if busi­ness mod­els have proven to be re­silient dur­ing and after the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>IN­VESTORS ARE MORE PICKY</p>
    <p>a pro­tracted eco­nomic re­ces­sion, in­vestors are look­ing for start-ups that can demon­strate a more sta­ble and re­al­is­tic cus­tomer pipe­line and rev­enue pro­jec­tion.”</p>
    <p>But while in­vestors are ex­er­cis­ing cau­tion, there are still funds avail­able to be de­ployed, said Mr Mag­nus Grime­land, chief ex­ec­u­tive of ven­ture cap­i­tal firm Antler.</p>
    <p>He noted that while ven­ture cap­i­tal­ists raised around US$100 bil­lion over 2018 and last year, only a por­tion of this cap­i­tal has been de­ployed, leav­ing a tremen­dous amount of dry pow­der avail­able.</p>
    <p>Ms Huang said some in­vestors have re­vised their of­fers to star­tups dur­ing this pe­riod as well, which has re­sulted in of­fers at lower val­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>But lower val­u­a­tions in the short term will not mat­ter much in the long run if en­trepreneur­s build a strong and suc­cess­ful busi­ness, said Mr Grime­land, em­pha­sis­ing that the op­por­tu­ni­ties for start-up growth are larger than ever with “decades worth of change in months in many in­dus­tries”.</p>
    <p>Mr Har­nal said there has been some re­cov­ery since the March to April pe­riod, when val­u­a­tions had no­tably taken a hit with the global virus spread.</p>
    <p>“Now, in­vestors are get­ting used to the new (mar­ket) norms and there is some con­cen­tra­tion of cap­i­tal es­pe­cially among firms which are seen to be (in­dus­try lead­ers) and those that are promis­ing,” he said.</p>
