    <p>NEW YORK • The Brook­lyn Nets started off cold but in the end, their All-Star duo came up clutch to end the At­lanta Hawks’ run as one of only two Na­tional Basketball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) teams to re­main un­beaten this sea­son.</p>
    <p>Kevin Du­rant scored 33 points and Kyrie Irving added 17 of his 25 points in the fourth quar­ter as the hosts out­lasted the vis­i­tors for a wild 145-141 vic­tory in New York on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The pair re­turned af­ter sit­ting out Brook­lyn’s previous game – a loss to the Mem­phis Griz­zles – but ini­tially strug­gled to as­sert them­selves with At­lanta seek­ing their first 4-0 start since 2010-11.</p>
    <p>Irving had a three-of-16 start but caught fire in the fi­nal 12 min­utes, shoot­ing seven of 11.</p>
    <p>Du­rant, like­wise, made six-of-15 shots be­fore end­ing with a game­high 33 points.</p>
    <p>Along with 23 points from team­mate Joe Har­ris, 18 of those com­ing from beyond the arc, they helped to over­come 30 points apiece from Hawks duo John Collins and Trae Young as well as off nights from Brook­lyn starters DeAn­dre Jor­dan and Ti­mothe Luwawu-Cabar­rot, who had just five and three points re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Du­rant ad­mit­ted the Nets need to im­prove de­fen­sively if they are to live up to their billing as cham­pi­onship con­tenders.</p>
    <p>“When you’re not mak­ing shots early on, you need your guys to come on and pick you up,” the for­ward told the Daily News.</p>
    <p>“De­fences are gonna be fo­cused on Kyrie and my­self, so hav­ing guys like Tau­rean (Prince) and Landry (Shamet) who can knock down shots for us.</p>
    <p>“We had seven guys in dou­ble fig­ures, and that’s only good for the team. But we can’t give up 140 points.”</p>
    <p>The Nets host the Hawks again to­day and Du­rant is lik­ing what he has seen so far from their op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>At­lanta have not made the play­offs since 2016-17 and fin­ished as the se­cond-worst team in the East­ern Con­fer­ence last term, but they have a young team, led by All-Star Young, who are fast im­prov­ing.</p>
    <p>“We (Brook­lyn) switch a lot on pick-and-rolls and this team slips out,” he said.</p>
    <p>“John Collins is prob­a­bly the best in the league at slip­ping out of screens with Trae.”</p>
    <p>Else­where in the East, the Mi­ami Heat, last sea­son’s fi­nal­ists, re­bounded from a crush­ing 47-point loss to the Mil­wau­kee Bucks the day be­fore with a 119-108 vic­tory over the same op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>The Heat did not have to wait long for re­venge as they hosted the Bucks for the se­cond straight night, with Go­ran Dragic com­ing off the bench to lead the team with 26 points.</p>
    <p>Mil­wau­kee, fu­elled by a triple­dou­ble of 26 points 13 re­bounds and 10 as­sists from two-time Most Valu­able Player Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo, looked like mak­ing it two wins in a row when they led by 14 in the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>But the Heat ral­lied de­spite miss­ing All-Star Jimmy But­ler for the se­cond straight game in what their coach Erik Spoel­stra called a sign of their “grit and tough­ness”.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the game, the Heat had spo­ken about “a lot of anger and frus­tra­tion” that had built up fol­low­ing Tues­day’s 144-97 blowout loss to the Bucks, the No. 1 seeds in the past two sea­sons, so a re­ac­tion on home court had been ex­pected.</p>
    <p>“Our guys re­sponded in an ap­pro­pri­ate fash­ion,” he said.</p>
    <p>“To­day was just about get­ting to work and pre­par­ing, and do­ing what we need to do to have a bet­ter ver­sion.”</p>
    <p>Guard Tyler Herro, who con­trib­uted 21 points with a ca­reer-best 15 re­bounds, added: “Started to feel like Mi­ami Heat basketball again.”</p>
