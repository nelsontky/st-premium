    <p>As a dig­i­tal vis­ual ef­fects stu­dent at Ngee Ann Polytech­nic, Mr Low Wei Teck’s dream was to study art, de­sign and me­dia (ADM) at univer­sity. De­spite grad­u­at­ing at the top of his co­hort, the pho­tog­ra­phy and film-mak­ing en­thu­si­ast did not make the cut for his de­sired univer­sity pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Dis­ap­pointed, he de­cided to ex­plore other op­tions, and ended up with some­thing com­pletely dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>In 2018, he en­rolled in the Bach­e­lor of Busi­ness An­a­lyt­ics with Mi­nor in In­for­ma­tion Tech­nol­ogy pro­gramme at the Singapore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences (SUSS).</p>
    <p>“An­a­lyt­ics is very close to ADM as both are ul­ti­mately about telling a story to the au­di­ence. Un­like film and vis­ual ef­fects how­ever, in an­a­lyt­ics, we com­mu­ni­cate ef­fi­ciently us­ing data,” ex­plains the 24-year-old.</p>
    <p>“Singapore is be­com­ing a dig­i­tal and Smart Na­tion, and busi­ness an­a­lyt­ics is a grow­ing in­dus­try. I like how my ed­u­ca­tion jour­ney will not sim­ply end when I grad­u­ate. Con­tin­u­ous learn­ing is needed so I can grow as an ex­pert in the field.”</p>
    <p>This year, Mr Low was awarded the SUSS Schol­ar­ship, which is bond-free and in­cludes ben­e­fits such as full cov­er­age of course fees.</p>

    <p>MR LOW WEI TECK, stu­dent</p>
    <p>Singapore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences</p>
    <p>A fo­cus on ser­vice learn­ing</p>
    <p>Mr Low’s pas­sion lies in mak­ing a change in the world, by lever­ag­ing data science and ma­chine learn­ing to build pre­dic­tive mod­els that help make bet­ter de­ci­sions — in par­tic­u­lar, for so­cial good.</p>
    <p>The third-year stu­dent is al­ready mak­ing a dif­fer­ence at SUSS, which has a fo­cus on ser­vice learn­ing.</p>
    <p>As a for­mer pres­i­dent of SUSS Im­pact, he or­gan­ised events to fos­ter stu­dent bond­ing and re­lax­ation. He is also ac­tive in the SUSS Busi­ness An­a­lyt­ics In­ter­est Group, which holds bond­ing and com­mu­nity-in­volve­ment events, and P2P teaching ses­sions.</p>
    <p>Mr Low was also part of an SUSS team that won a J.P. Mor­gan Cor­po­rate Chal­lenge last year, beat­ing other lo­cal uni­ver­si­ties in a so­cial me­dia contest and 5km race.</p>
    <p>He says: “Through my in­volve­ment in th­ese ac­tiv­i­ties, I have de­vel­oped as a leader and be­come more self­less in giv­ing back to the stu­dent body. We keep a look­out for in­di­vid­u­als who may need more help.”</p>
    <p>Real-world lessons</p>
    <p>Be­yond SUSS, Mr Low has had am­ple ex­po­sure to the work­ing world.</p>
    <p>Last year, he par­tic­i­pated in a pres­ti­gious two-week sum­mer pro­gramme at top busi­ness school Au­den­cia in Nantes, France, where he took two cour­ses — Euro­pean Eco­nom­ics, and Big Data and Mar­ket­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Low has also in­terned at pub­lic re­la­tions firm Edel­man and e-commerce plat­form Shopee. Cur­rently, he is a data science in­tern at re­tail data an­a­lyt­ics com­pany Om­nistream, with a fo­cus on us­ing data an­a­lyt­ics and visu­al­i­sa­tion to de­rive high-level in­sights that help drive the com­pany’s de­ci­sion-mak­ing pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing his free time, he takes on­line cour­ses to equip him­self with in­dus­try skills. “I am still rel­a­tively new to the in­dus­try, so there are of­ten steep learn­ing curves,” he ex­plains.</p>
    <p>“But my in­tern­ships have ex­posed me to things be­yond the school cur­ricu­lum and given me a taste of what work­ing in the in­dus­try is like.”</p>
    <p>Mr Low is keen to pur­sue fur­ther ed­u­ca­tion in com­puter science or data science, and dreams of be­com­ing a data sci­en­tist.</p>
    <p>He adds: “I want to give back to SUSS by help­ing fu­ture batches of Busi­ness An­a­lyt­ics un­der­grad­u­ates get ac­cus­tomed to the ever-grow­ing in­dus­try.”</p>
