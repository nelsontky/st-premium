    <p>Eng­land coach Ed­die Jones said crit­ics of their style were be­ing “dis­re­spect­ful” to his play­ers, af­ter they needed ex­tra time to beat a third-string France 22-19 in the Au­tumn Na­tions Cup fi­nal at Twick­en­ham on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The rugby tour­na­ment, cob­bled to­gether amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, was dom­i­nated by set­piece for­ward play, ag­gres­sive de­fence and tac­ti­cal kick­ing, lead­ing some pun­dits to fear for the fu­ture of rugby union.</p>
    <p>De­spite the dire fore­casts, Eng­land and France nev­er­the­less pro­duced an en­gross­ing clash, with full-back Brice Dulin scor­ing a fine try, as the vis­i­tors, boast­ing just 68 caps in their start­ing XV, es­tab­lished a 13-6 lead at half-time.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there were mo­ments when the teams’ kick­ing duel re­sem­bled a pro­longed French Open base­line rally, with the crowd of 2,000 boo­ing one such ex­change af­ter spec­ta­tors were let in for the first time in nine months.</p>
    <p>Luke Cowan-Dickie was even­tu­ally driven over for a try, while Eng­land captain Owen Far­rell who, un­usu­ally missed four of his nine goal kicks, tied the score at 19-19 with the en­su­ing con­ver­sion be­fore land­ing a match-win­ning penalty in sud­den-death ex­tra time.</p>
    <p>Jones, how­ever, had no qualms about the re­sult and re­sponded an­grily when ques­tioned by reporters about the man­ner of a vic­tory that saw Eng­land avenge their only de­feat this year, a 24-17 loss to France in Paris in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>“Can I just say I think you are be­ing to­tally dis­re­spect­ful to the play­ers the way you crit­i­cise the rugby,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It’s a tough time for the sport, it’s a tough time to play rugby and we are all try­ing to play as good a rugby as we can.</p>
    <p>“Con­sider the play­ers are com­ing off at least a 10-month sea­son with­out hav­ing any pre-sea­son to pre­pare for the in­ter­na­tional game. It is a sport we love and it is a dif­fi­cult game to play.”</p>
    <p>Asked if teams had a re­spon­si­bil­ity to en­ter­tain, as well as win, Jones snapped: “That is not the point and I find the ques­tion a bit child­ish. Ob­vi­ously, you have to win. If we don’t win, we don’t coach.</p>
    <p>“Had we run the ball from ev­ery­where and got turned over 30 times and been beaten 30-15, you’d have said why didn’t we kick the ball more.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese are the best play­ers in the world and you’re telling me they’re play­ing that game be­cause they don’t want to play good rugby? Be re­spect­ful to the play­ers.</p>
    <p>“We’re try­ing to win games of rugby... The eas­i­est way at times is to kick the ball, other times it is to run the ball. We’re al­ways look­ing to get the right bal­ance.”</p>
