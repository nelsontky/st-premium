    <p>SBS Tran­sit will help its staff sue their abusers in court – if they wish to – by ap­point­ing and pay­ing for lawyers, fol­low­ing a spate of abuse cases re­cently.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, the trans­port op­er­a­tor said it does not “tol­er­ate any abuse against its staff and will fully back any staff who wish to de­fend their rights be­yond the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem and file for civil ac­tion”.</p>
    <p>It added that it will help “vic­timised staff nav­i­gate the le­gal sys­tem”, in­clud­ing ap­point­ing rep­re­sen­ta­tion and foot­ing le­gal fees.</p>
    <p>There has been a num­ber of acts of vi­o­lence against its front-line staff in the last few months, par­tic­u­larly for en­forc­ing the mask-up rule, said SBS Tran­sit.</p>
    <p>The lat­est in­ci­dent took place on Tues­day, when a 52-year-old com­muter, who was not wear­ing a mask, hurled vul­gar­i­ties at a 39-year-old bus driver and punched him re­peat­edly on the head.</p>
    <p>The driver was given three days of med­i­cal leave, while the man was yes­ter­day charged with vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing hurt and pos­ses­sion of an of­fen­sive weapon for hav­ing a knife with a 6cm-long blade on him.</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung de­nounced the in­ci­dent in a Face­book post yes­ter­day, call­ing it “dis­turb­ing” and “de­spi­ca­ble”.</p>
    <p>He learnt of the in­ci­dent dur­ing a di­a­logue with SMRT staff on Wed­nes­day. One is­sue clearly on the minds of the work­ers dur­ing the di­a­logue was dif­fi­cult com­muters who do not wear masks or do not wear them prop­erly, he said.</p>
    <p>“Trans­port ser­vice staff are do­ing their job, mak­ing sure the sys­tem is safe for all of us. We all have a re­spon­si­bil­ity to wear a mask in pub­lic – a sim­ple civic duty,” said Mr Ong. “Such bla­tant dis­re­gard for fel­low com­muters, and as­sault­ing a bus cap­tain who was do­ing his job, is de­spi­ca­ble,” he added.</p>
    <p>He com­mended SBS Tran­sit for fully back­ing its em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>SBS Tran­sit high­lighted two other abuse cases last month, when com­muters ver­bally and phys­i­cally abused bus driv­ers who were en­forc­ing the mask rule.</p>
    <p>On Aug 20, a com­muter be­rated a bus driver and grabbed his shirt af­ter the driver ad­vised him to wear his mask prop­erly.</p>
    <p>The day be­fore, an­other com­muter who was wear­ing a neck gaiter filmed him­self mak­ing dis­parag­ing re­marks about a bus driver who was try­ing to clar­ify if neck gaiters could be used in place of masks.</p>
    <p>SBS Tran­sit’s act­ing chief ex­ec­u­tive Cheng Siak Kian con­demned the at­tacks as un­called for, and said they must stop. “Our peo­ple go to work ev­ery day to do their jobs – in­clud­ing en­forc­ing strict rules and reg­u­la­tions. To be called names, abused or even at­tacked for ask­ing some­one to put on a mask or pay the cor­rect fare is wrong.”</p>
    <p>He added: “In se­vere cases like the in­ci­dent on Sept 15, we will not hes­i­tate to pro­vide all as­sis­tance in­clud­ing ap­point­ing lawyers to help him sue his as­sailant for all dam­ages and losses in­curred by him.”</p>
    <p>In a state­ment with SBS Tran­sit, the Na­tional Trans­port Work­ers’ Union (NTWU) said it hopes the au­thor­i­ties charg­ing the 52-year-old man “sends a strong sig­nal to all</p>
    <p>Trans­port ser­vice staff are do­ing their job, mak­ing sure the sys­tem is safe for all of us. We all have a re­spon­si­bil­ity to wear a mask in pub­lic – a sim­ple civic duty. Such bla­tant dis­re­gard for fel­low com­muters, and as­sault­ing a bus cap­tain who was do­ing his job, is de­spi­ca­ble.</p>
    <p>TRANS­PORT MIN­IS­TER ONG YE KUNG</p>
    <p>Our peo­ple go to work ev­ery day to do their jobs – in­clud­ing en­forc­ing strict rules and reg­u­la­tions. To be called names, abused or even at­tacked for ask­ing some­one to put on a mask or pay the cor­rect fare is wrong.</p>
    <p>SBS TRAN­SIT’S ACT­ING CHIEF EX­EC­U­TIVE CHENG SIAK KIAN</p>
    <p>that such acts of abuse will not be con­doned”.</p>
    <p>NTWU ex­ec­u­tive sec­re­tary Melvin Yong said: “Mov­ing for­ward, the union will con­tinue to work closely with the au­thor­i­ties and the dif­fer­ent pub­lic trans­port op­er­a­tors to ex­am­ine how we can step up on de­ter­rence mea­sures to fur­ther pro­tect our pub­lic trans­port work­ers.”</p>
