    <p>Not many for­eign play­ers would choose to stick with the last-place team for a sec­ond sea­son, but Croa­t­ian for­wards Kris­ti­jan Kra­jcek and Sime Zuzul per­sisted with Balestier Khalsa, and it looks like they have made the right de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>The Tigers host Lion City Sailors at Bis­han Sta­dium to­day and with al­most half the sea­son gone, it is the third-placed un­der­dogs who have a three-point ad­van­tage over their more glam­orous op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>Bankrolled by bil­lion­aire For­rest Li and his tech firm Sea, the Sailors are the Sin­ga­pore Premier League’s (SPL) only pri­va­tised club. Yet they have won just two of their six games this term and lie sixth in the eight-team stand­ings.</p>
    <p>But Kra­jcek is not sur­prised. The 27-year-old, who has one goal and three as­sists so far, said: “Balestier wanted to keep me and Sime, and I felt it was a good op­por­tu­nity to prove we are bet­ter than where we fin­ished last sea­son.</p>
    <p>“I know I can do more and make more of an im­pact. I was con­fi­dent with our cap­tain and goal­keeper Zai­ful Nizam back from in­jury, and one or two qual­ity ad­di­tions, we will be able to change the im­pres­sion that we are a bad team. I think we have done that, but we can still get bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter los­ing their opener 1-0 to cur­rent lead­ers Tampines Rovers, Balestier have been un­de­feated in their last five games. The last time they went on such a run was in 2015. This form can be partly at­trib­uted to their for­eign re­cruit­ment – all four im­ports have scored this cam­paign, a feat no other SPL club can boast.</p>
    <p>Be­sides Kra­jcek and 24-year-old Zuzul (one goal), 2018 SPL top</p>
    <p>scorer Shuhei Hoshino, 24, has chipped in with two goals and two as­sists while Ser­bian de­fender En­sar Brunce­vic, 21, has put his 1.96m frame to good use, con­tribut­ing three goals and two clean sheets.</p>
    <p>Marko Kral­je­vic, 54, has coached the club since 2014 and hailed his play­ers’ char­ac­ter in train­ing and matches. He de­scribed the cur­rent crop as a bet­ter team than the one that won the 2014 Sin­ga­pore Cup.</p>
    <p>He said: “We have good im­ports and lo­cals like Haz­zuwan Halim and Ah­mad Syahir, and a good blend of ex­pe­ri­ence and youth, with no prima don­nas in our team.</p>
    <p>“It won’t mat­ter how good the for­eign play­ers are in­di­vid­u­ally, if they can­not gel with our lo­cal play­ers. But we have good team spirit, and they have been hard­work­ing and un­selfish. For ex­am­ple, Kiki’s (Kris­ti­jan’s) goal and as­sists are with his left foot, but he is ac­tu­ally a right-footer who is good with both feet. And he is the first to train­ing and the last to leave.</p>
    <p>“They stay back af­ter train­ing to work on their shoot­ing and cross­ing, and our young play­ers should learn from them.”</p>
    <p>The quar­tet live in the same apart­ment and have built a strong cama</p>
    <p>raderie, es­pe­cially dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker and seven-month SPL sus­pen­sion due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Kra­jcek said: “It was a tough pe­riod for us as we are away from our fam­i­lies, but we were able to pro­vide com­pany and en­cour­age­ment for each other. I’m the old­est and more se­ri­ous one in the group, and Sime is the joker. Bruno (Brunce­vic) and Jumbo (Hoshino) are more shy and their English is not so good yet, so we com­mu­ni­cate with Google Trans­late, and ges­tures. But we have be­come good friends, and we have de­vel­oped a good un­der­stand­ing on the pitch.”</p>
    <p>While Kral­je­vic had set a topthree tar­get be­fore the restart, his play­ers want more.</p>
    <p>Zai­ful said: “The Sailors have qual­ity in depth, they have strong at­tack­ers, but we are con­fi­dent of giv­ing them a good fight.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve we can beat any team in this league, and want to fin­ish as high as pos­si­ble. It is ev­ery player’s dream to win the lo­cal league and qual­ify for the AFC Cham­pi­ons League, and it is achiev­able, but we have to fo­cus on the up­com­ing game and stick to our game plan.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">Balestier&#x2019;s Ja&#xAD;panese for&#xAD;ward Shuhei Hoshino and Croa&#xAD;t&#xAD;ian duo Kris&#xAD;ti&#xAD;jan Kra&#xAD;jcek (cen&#xAD;tre) and Sime Zuzul have col&#xAD;lec&#xAD;tively scored four goals and pro&#xAD;vided five as&#xAD;sists this SPL sea&#xAD;son. While they may need Google Trans&#xAD;late to com&#xAD;mu&#xAD;ni&#xAD;cate off the pitch, on it they have de&#xAD;vel&#xAD;oped a good un&#xAD;der&#xAD;stand&#xAD;ing.</p>
