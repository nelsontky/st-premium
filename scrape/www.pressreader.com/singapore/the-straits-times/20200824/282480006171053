    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • For nearly a cen­tury, Chateau Mar­mont has been an adopted home and play­ground for Hol­ly­wood’s elite, dis­creetly host­ing so­phis­ti­cated Golden Age icons and rau­cous Brat Pack celebri­ties.</p>
    <p>Etched into Tin­sel­town folk­lore, it is where Amer­i­can ac­tor James Dean crashed di­rec­tor Ni­cholas Ray’s bun­ga­low to bag the lead in Rebel With­out A Cause (1955), and where ac­tress Jean Har­low and ac­tor Clark Gable al­legedly con­ducted a tor­rid af­fair in the 1930s.</p>
    <p>More re­cently, the i mpos­ing Gothic ho­tel, perched above the fa­mous Sun­set Strip, has be­come a hub for swanky show-busi­ness par­ties, from ac­tor Leonardo DiCaprio’s 21st birth­day bash to mu­sic cou­ple Bey­once and Jay-Z’s se­cret Os­cars af­ter-par­ties.</p>
    <p>The ho­tel is so syn­ony­mous with Hol­ly­wood glam­our that it has its own film cred­its, ap­pear­ing i n movies from 2018’s A Star Is Born re­make to the mu­si­cal La La Land (2016) to di­rec­tor Sofia Cop­pola’s Some­where (2010).</p>
    <p>But the sto­ried in­sti­tu­tion, which prides it­self on be­ing highly se­lec­tive about who it ad­mits – and then keep­ing their se­crets closely guarded – is about to get a whole lot more pri­vate and dis­cern­ing, its owner told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>Later this year, it will be­come a mem­ber-owned ho­tel, of­fer­ing ded­i­cated do­mes­tic staff, pri­vate din­ing and long-term stor­age of per­sonal be­long­ings to an in­vi­ta­tiononly, fi­nan­cial stake-own­ing in­ner sanc­tum.</p>
    <p>“I’d com­pare it to a su­per-yacht... you can de­liver that kind of ser­vice – and have peo­ple on deck – only if they’re al­most hand-se­lected,” said Bos­ton-born hote­lier An­dre Balazs, who once dated ac­tress Uma Thur­man.</p>
    <p>No de­tails are yet avail­able on the costs of mem­ber­ship.</p>
    <p>Mr Balazs, 63, has been mulling the tran­si­tion for years, with the process now ac­cel­er­ated by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Com­mon sense and even a mod­icum of un­der­stand­ing of health re­quires that you sur­round your­self with fewer peo­ple,” he said. “In this time, it al­lows you to be safer and cu­rate a more in­ter­est­ing crowd.”</p>
    <p>The con­cept of mem­bers-only in­sti­tu­tions of­fer­ing ac­com­mo­da­tion is well es­tab­lished in cities such as Lon­don, but newer to Los An­ge­les, where Soho House launched its buzzy West Hol­ly­wood out­post just a decade ago.</p>
    <p>At Chateau Mar­mont, shielded­off pri­vate quar­ters will serve an “es­sen­tially no­madic” wealthy and cre­ative elite tired of tra­di­tional lux­ury ho­tels, Mr Balazs said.</p>
    <p>But he in­sists me­dia re­ports that Chateau Mar­mont is set to ape “ex­clu­sion­ary clubs”, such as White’s in Lon­don, are wide off the mark.</p>
    <p>Those re­ports trig­gered a back­lash in Los An­ge­les among stargaz­ers fear­ful they will no longer be able to dine across from their favourite celebri­ties.</p>
    <p>Yet, as a Los An­ge­les Times op-ed re­cently pointed out, Chateau Mar­mot has “long been a VIP club that only pre­tends to be open to the pub­lic”, ca­ter­ing largely to a closely guarded list of re­peat guests.</p>
    <p>Shawn Levy, au­thor of The Cas­tle On Sun­set, also noted that “an in­fu­sion of ini­ti­a­tion fees and mem­ber­ship dues would be a god­send, as the Chateau, like most ho­tels, has with­ered dur­ing the pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>The vast ma­jor­ity of ho­tel staff were laid off in March.</p>
    <p>“We’ve se­ri­ously had to down­size, ob­vi­ously,” said Mr Balazs, who do­nated US$100,000 (S$137,170) to a staff fund-raiser.</p>
    <p>The new, mem­ber-owned model is a re­turn to Chateau Mar­mont’s roots. It was con­structed as a high­end apart­ment build­ing in 1929, modelled af­ter the Chateau d’Am­boise in the Loire Val­ley.</p>
    <p>Mr Balazs in­tends to roll out the scheme to cities such as Lon­don and New York – where he al­ready owns ho­tels – and ru­ral out­posts in­clud­ing “a spec­tac­u­lar chateau in the south of France”.</p>
    <p>But the hote­lier in­sists it is mere co­in­ci­dence that he is start­ing the ex­per­i­ment at the leg­endary Mar­mont – his first ho­tel, pur­chased in 1990, long af­ter many of its fa­bled Hol­ly­wood shenani­gans.</p>
    <p>“We don’t traf­fic in glam­our,” said Mr Balazs. “We traf­fic in ser­vice to our guests – dis­cre­tion and ser­vice and safety, pri­vacy. That’s what we make our money on.”</p>
