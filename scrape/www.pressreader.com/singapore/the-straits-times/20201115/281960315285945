    <p>It could well be the plot of a thriller: A fu­neral par­lour em­ployee col­lects the wrong body from the em­balm­ing ta­ble and it ends up be­ing cre­mated in front of some­body else’s mourn­ing fam­ily.</p>
    <p>But that is pre­cisely what hap­pened on Dec 30 last year, when the body of 82-year-old Kee Kin Tiong ended up in the fur­nace.</p>
    <p>Mr Kee, a Taoist, was given Chris­tian fu­neral rites meant for a 70-year-old man, whose body was sched­uled for cre­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>For months fol­low­ing this in­ci­dent, Har­mony Fu­neral Care founder Har­mony Tee was afraid to hand out her business card.</p>
    <p>“I was scared that when peo­ple saw the name card and started to google, they would know ev­ery­thing,” Ms Tee, 27, told The Sun­day Times nearly a year after the episode.</p>
    <p>“But I have to ac­cept that it is part of my life.”</p>
    <p>She hopes that she can move on and re­gain her cus­tomers’ trust.</p>
    <p>To avoid this night­mar­ish sce­nario from re­oc­cur­ring, changes have been made. Among these is the roll-out of a mo­bile ap­pli­ca­tion that would no­tify Ms Tee if a body was mis­tak­enly col­lected.</p>
    <p>This comes as fu­neral op­er­a­tors are held to higher stan­dards by the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA), which has in the past year is­sued stricter rules in­clud­ing main­tain­ing proper records of the de­ceased be­ing han­dled, and us­ing body iden­ti­fi­ca­tion tags bear­ing de­tails such as the de­ceased’s name.</p>
    <p>Ms Tee had to ex­plain what hap­pened to the fam­i­lies in­volved and deal with the fall­out.</p>
    <p>“I had a lot of guilt and doubt,” said Ms Tee, whose fam­ily has been in the fu­neral line for many decades.</p>
    <p>Her late grand­fa­ther Tee Hock Ch­wee was the founder of Hock Hin Un­der­taker, a business es­tab­lished in 1963.</p>
    <p>“Even though the Kee fam­ily did not en­gage us as their un­der­taker, my em­ployee was the one who did not fol­low pro­to­cols and made a mis­take. I took re­spon­si­bil­ity for the mis­take,” she said.</p>
    <p>But this is not the first time bod­ies have been mixed up, Ms Tee main­tained, adding that un­der­tak­ers have had to go down and apol­o­gise to fam­i­lies in the past.</p>
    <p>On the morn­ing of Dec 30, her em­ployee was sup­posed to col­lect the body of a 70-year-old man ly­ing in the em­balm­ing room at Cen­tury Prod­ucts Com­pany, but took Mr Kee’s body in­stead.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that the in­dus­try stan­dard then was to use a white cloth with the par­tic­u­lars of the de­ceased scrib­bled on it for iden­ti­fi­ca­tion, Ms Tee re­vealed that her staff no­ticed the cloth was miss­ing but did not ver­ify with the em­balmer.</p>
    <p>“This cloth can eas­ily be mis­placed, which was what hap­pened,” she claimed. “He was so sure that it was the right body.”</p>
    <p>Mr Kee’s body was then er­ro­neously placed in a closed cof­fin – meant for the 70-year-old man – and cre­mated at Mandai Cre­ma­to­rium that morn­ing. The man’s fam­ily had cho­sen not to view the body.</p>
    <p>Shortly after the cre­ma­tion, Har­mony Fu­neral Care re­ceived news from the other fu­neral firm, Tan Khiam Soon Un­der­taker, that it had taken the wrong body.</p>
    <p>AC­CEP­TANCE</p>
    <p>The man’s fam­ily were im­me­di­ately in­formed of the mis­take, but they did not pur­sue the mat­ter, said Ms Tee.</p>
    <p>They even­tu­ally cre­mated the cor­rect body the next day.</p>
    <p>After the blun­der, she also apol­o­gised to Mr Kee’s fam­ily in per­son.</p>
    <p>Her firm, which turned two last month, is still hop­ing to set­tle the mat­ter with the Kee fam­ily am­i­ca­bly.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily had ear­lier told The Sun­day Times that they were in “great pain” over the or­deal.</p>
    <p>They had waited at their home’s void deck to re­ceive the pa­tri­arch’s body for his wake, only to be told it had been cre­mated.</p>
    <p>The em­ployee who made the tragic mis­take has since left the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>On Jan 4, the NEA barred Har­mony Fu­neral Care from us­ing the Gov­ern­ment’s after-death fa­cil­i­ties, after the firm was found to have in­suf­fi­cient mea­sures to en­sure the proper han­dling of bod­ies.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally thought that we would go out of business. I even started to look for ac­coun­tancy jobs,” said Ms Tee, a for­mer au­di­tor who quit her job three years ago to join the business.</p>
    <p>For the past few months, she has been fo­cus­ing on im­prov­ing pro­cesses. This in­cludes cre­at­ing an app to track the stages of pro­cess­ing a dead body.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the firm now re­quires fam­ily mem­bers to iden­tify the body be­fore it is cre­mated.</p>
    <p>On Feb 13, the NEA lifted its curbs on the com­pany after it put in place ad­e­quate mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Business dipped ini­tially but it re­turned to nor­mal a few weeks later.</p>
    <p>Since then, Ms Tee tests new hires on their knowl­edge of pro­ce­dures and su­per­vises them for a few as­sign­ments be­fore let­ting them work in­de­pen­dently.</p>
    <p>“We use the in­ci­dent as an ex­am­ple to il­lus­trate the im­mense reper­cus­sions of not fol­low­ing es­tab­lished pro­to­cols,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Ul­ti­mately, we are han­dling the body of a loved one.”</p>
    <p>I was scared that when peo­ple saw the name card and started to google, they would know ev­ery­thing... But I have to ac­cept that it is part of my life.</p>

    <p>FEAR OF GO­ING OUT OF BUSINESS</p>
    <p>I re­ally thought that we would go out of business. I even started to look for ac­coun­tancy jobs.</p>
