    <p>FRESH START: Tai­wanese ac­tor Kai Ko (right) is hop­ing to re­build his ca­reer af­ter it was ru­ined by a drug ar­rest six years ago.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, the 29-year-old, who shot to fame in his de­but movie, You Are The Ap­ple Of My Eye, in 2011, posted on so­cial me­dia sev­eral pho­tos of him­self in the hit com­ing-of-age film.</p>
    <p>He wrote: “Nine years ago, I be­gan a crazy jour­ney with the re­lease of my first movie. Thanks to ev­ery­one who has al­ways been with me. I don’t know what to say, but I will try my best to re­build the dreams which I have shat­tered per­son­ally, as I put them back piece by piece.”</p>
    <p>His act­ing ca­reer had looked bright when his role in the film won him the Best New Per­former ac­co­lade at the Golden Horse Awards. He played a re­bel­lious high-school stu­dent who falls in love with his crush, played by ac­tress Michelle Chen. The movie, di­rected by nov­el­ist Gid­dens Ko, is based on his semi-au­to­bi­o­graph­i­cal novel of the same name.</p>
    <p>Kai Ko’s world came crash­ing down in 2014 when he was ar­rested, along with Hong Kong ac­tor Jaycee Chan, for tak­ing drugs in Bei­jing. Chan is the son of Hong Kong ac­tion star Jackie Chan.</p>
    <p>Ko served two weeks in de­ten­tion, while Chan was sen­tenced to six months’ jail for shel­ter­ing drug users.</p>
    <p>Ko re­turned to the big screen in a lead­ing role last month with A Choo, which was sup­posed to be re­leased in 2014 but was de­layed when he was ar­rested. The fan­tasy ro­mance drama is based on an­other of Gid­dens Ko’s nov­els and also stars Tai­wanese ac­tress Ariel Lin.</p>
    <p>There is talk that Ko and Lin are among the favourites to be nom­i­nated for the Golden Horse Awards this year, which is sched­uled to be held in Novem­ber.</p>
