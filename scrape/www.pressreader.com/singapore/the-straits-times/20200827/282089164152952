    <p>For vol­un­teer med­i­cal prac­ti­tioner Bha­vani Sri­ram, pa­tience and di­ag­no­sis go hand in hand.</p>
    <p>Through the Move­ment for the In­tel­lec­tu­ally Dis­abled of Sin­ga­pore (Minds), she has seen more than 240 pa­tients in two years and made 40 house vis­its, pro­vid­ing med­i­cal care to those with in­tel­lec­tual dis­abil­i­ties or autism spectrum dis­or­der.</p>
    <p>Due to dif­fi­cul­ties in com­mu­ni­cat­ing with doc­tors, peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties of­ten face challenges in get­ting proper med­i­cal treat­ment and care.</p>
    <p>As a for­mer staff mem­ber at KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hospi­tal, where she worked with chil­dren with Down syn­drome, Dr Bha­vani bridged the com­mu­ni­ca­tion gap and pro­vided med­i­cal care to peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The 62-year-old, who cur­rently heads the Minds De­vel­op­men­tal Dis­abil­i­ties Med­i­cal Clinic, was also in­stru­men­tal in en­cour­ag­ing spe­cial­ists in eye care, hear­ing and den­tal ser­vices to pro­vide as­sess­ments and treat­ment to Minds clients.</p>
    <p>For her stead­fast ser­vice to those in need, Dr Bha­vani was one of five win­ners last year of the an­nual Sin­ga­pore Silent He­roes Awards, con­ferred by so­cial welfare or­gan­i­sa­tion Civil­ians As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>She won an award in the Hearts of Hu­man­ity cat­e­gory, which hon­ours in­di­vid­u­als who have helped oth­ers with dis­abil­i­ties, or in­di­vid­u­als who face dis­abil­i­ties them­selves and have achieved their goals.</p>
    <p>The hunt is now on to find the win­ners for this year’s awards.</p>
    <p>First given out in 2014, the awards aim to recog­nise peo­ple who have made a dif­fer­ence in their com­mu­ni­ties without seek­ing any re­wards or recog­ni­tion.</p>
    <p>Last year’s five win­ners, who were cho­sen from a pool of 45 nom­i­na­tions from mem­bers of the pub­lic, included ed­u­ca­tion spe­cial­ist Jeremy Tong, 30, and so­cial en­tre­pre­neur Aminur Rasyid Mo­hamed An­war, 31.</p>
    <p>At the age of 29, Mr Tong was the youngest Sin­ga­porean to at­tempt to scale Mount Ever­est twice. De­spite fail­ing in his first at­tempt in 2017, he pushed ahead and suc</p>
    <p>This year’s edi­tion of the awards – the sev­enth – is open to in­di­vid­u­als across five cat­e­gories, in­clud­ing a new cat­e­gory called Com­pas­sion­ate For­eigner, which will recog­nise any for­eigner work­ing or re­sid­ing in Sin­ga­pore who has made ex­tra­or­di­nary con­tri­bu­tions here.</p>
    <p>ceeded in reach­ing the sum­mit last year.</p>
    <p>Af­fected by his un­cle’s cancer di­ag­no­sis in 2005, Mr Tong used his ef­forts to raise funds for cancer, rais­ing $13,000 in 2017 for the Sin­ga­pore Cancer So­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Mr Aminur, who was helped by a men­tor to find his con­fi­dence in school, co-founded a so­cial en­ter­prise, Ju­nior Art Lab, to im­part dig­i­tal lit­er­acy skills to dis­ad­van­taged and vul­ner­a­ble chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Ju­nior Art Lab ac­quired touch-en­abled com­puter de­vices which can help peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties and spe­cial needs with their learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Both men won in the In­spir­ing Youth cat­e­gory last year.</p>
    <p>This year’s edi­tion of the awards – the sev­enth – is open to in­di­vid­u­als across five cat­e­gories, in­clud­ing a new cat­e­gory called Com­pas­sion­ate For­eigner, which will recog­nise any for­eigner work­ing or re­sid­ing in Sin­ga­pore who has made ex­tra­or­di­nary con­tri­bu­tions here.</p>
    <p>Nom­i­na­tions for the awards are open un­til Oct 18, and a vir­tual awards cer­e­mony is ex­pected to take place on Nov 21.</p>
    <p>Nom­i­na­tions from the pub­lic will be short­listed be­fore a panel of judges se­lects the fi­nal win­ners in each cat­e­gory.</p>
