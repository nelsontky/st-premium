    <p>ROME • Af­ter en­dur­ing the hottest decade on record, In­dia aims to keep its homes and work­places cool with­out rais­ing en­ergy con­sump­tion with one sim­ple change: rais­ing the tem­per­a­ture set­tings on air-con­di­tion­ers.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has man­dated a de­fault tem­per­a­ture of 24 deg C – in­stead of the stan­dard 20 deg C to 21 deg C – for units made or sold from the start of this year, and wants com­mer­cial build­ings to keep air­con­di­tion­ing at that level.</p>
    <p>The mea­sure could cut na­tional en­ergy con­sump­tion by 24 per cent for house­holds and 20 per cent for busi­nesses, ac­cord­ing to Ms Gabrielle Drey­fus, co-au­thor of a re­port pub­lished on Fri­day that calls for a switch to more en­ergy-ef­fi­cient cooling sys­tems.</p>
    <p>The United Na­tions re­port said that while cooling de­vices like air­con­di­tion­ers and re­frig­er­a­tors are cru­cial to hu­man health and the global econ­omy, emis­sions from the fos­sil fu­els used to power them could worsen cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>“Dou­bling the en­ergy ef­fi­ciency of the cooling equip­ment... can save some­thing like 1,600 medi­um­sized power plants from be­ing built by 2030,” Mr Dur­wood Zaelke, cochair of the re­port’s steer­ing com­mit­tee, told the Thom­son Reuters Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>“That’s a tremen­dous amount of con­ven­tional and cli­mate pol­lu­tion you can avoid,” said Mr Zaelke, who heads the In­sti­tute for Gov­er­nance and Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment, a US think-tank.</p>
    <p>This should be a fo­cus in post-pan­demic re­cov­ery plans, said the re­port, which fol­lows re­cent heat­waves in the United States and Siberia.</p>
    <p>As cli­mate change brings ev­er­hot­ter days, world­wide de­mand for cooling ap­pli­ances is grow­ing – by up to 10 de­vices ev­ery sec­ond on top of an es­ti­mated 3.6 bil­lion that are cur­rently in use, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>It also said phas­ing out cli­mate­warm­ing re­frig­er­ant gases known as hy­droflu­o­ro­car­bons (HFCs) could help the world avoid up to 0.4 deg C of global warm­ing by 2100.</p>
    <p>The dif­fer­ence is sub­stan­tial in the con­text of the 2015 Paris Agree­ment on cli­mate change that aims to limit warm­ing to 1.5 deg C above pre-in­dus­trial times to pre­vent crises such as food and wa­ter short­ages, ris­ing seas and wors­en­ing weather events.</p>
    <p>Bet­ter build­ing de­sign could also help by re­duc­ing con­sump­tion or the need for cooling as well as cre­at­ing jobs, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, a clean white roof that re­flects 80 per cent of sun­light would stay about 30 deg C cooler than a grey roof that re­flects only 20 per cent of sun­light, while wellde­signed ci­ties could save 25 per cent of the en­ergy used for heat­ing and cooling.</p>
    <p>An­other way is to de­velop na­tional plans to ad­dress ris­ing cooling needs but with­out the cor­re­spond­ing rise in emis­sions, like what In­dia, China and Rwanda have done, Mr Zaelke said.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers like Ghana have banned “zom­bie” ap­pli­ances – cheap, out­dated fridges and air-con­di­tion­ers dis­carded mostly from homes in Europe and then il­le­gally resold – that re­lease HFCs.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, more than one bil­lion peo­ple l ack ac­cess to cooling, which puts their health and safety at risk, and a fur­ther 2.2 bil­lion are able to af­ford only cheaper, less en­ergy-ef­fi­cient cooling, a sep­a­rate re­port pub­lished on Thurs­day said.</p>
    <p>Mo­bil­is­ing finance for the sec­tor is cru­cial – while up­front costs might be high, en­ergy-ef­fi­cient tech­nolo­gies of­ten pay for them­selves in sav­ings within just a cou­ple of years, said Ms Drey­fus.</p>
    <p>“These tech­nolo­gies ex­ist. We just need to put in place the poli­cies and mech­a­nisms to make them more ac­ces­si­ble to peo­ple.”</p>
