    <p>By the time you read this, you might have al­ready spent quite a bit of money shop­ping for great deals in the Black Fri­day sale, and there is still Cy­ber Mon­day to come.</p>
    <p>Christ­mas is just weeks away, so now seems as good a time as any to splurge with a vengeance.</p>
    <p>After all, the pan­demic has re­sulted in many of us saving quite a bit of money that would oth­er­wise have been used for over­seas hol­i­days at this time of the year.</p>
    <p>So sup­port­ing lo­cal busi­nesses by shop­ping with that ex­tra cash is cer­tainly a good way to feel fes­tive as the year draws to an end.</p>
    <p>But be­fore you log in to put even more items into your on­line shop­ping cart for the Cy­ber Mon­day sale to­mor­row, ask your­self this im­por­tant ques­tion first – do you have any out­stand­ing debt on your credit cards that you have not cleared for the past few months?</p>
    <p>If your an­swer is “yes”, do your­self a favour by emp­ty­ing the shop­ping cart and putting an im­me­di­ate lock­down on all non-es­sen­tial pur­chases un­til you have cleared every cent of the old debt first.</p>
    <p>“Non-es­sen­tial” means you should not spend on any­thing un­less your sur­vival is de­pen­dent on it, such as ba­sic food items and util­ity bills for you and your fam­ily. Your ur­gent pri­or­ity is there­fore to pay off this debt first be­fore you in­cur more ex­penses.</p>
    <p>Yes, this seems dras­tic, but you will thank The Sun­day Times In­vest later for this ad­vice as it can save you from pos­si­bly fall­ing into a debt trap that is hard to get out of.</p>
    <p>The clear­est sign that you are at risk of such a trap is that you have a credit card debt that you can­not pay off im­me­di­ately. If you al­low this debt to grow and fes­ter, it will ruin you slowly and surely.</p>
    <p>Many do not re­alise that the No. 1 cause for peo­ple fall­ing into se­ri­ous fi­nan­cial trou­ble here is not gam­bling or bad in­vest­ments but the seem­ingly harm­less act of over­spend­ing to in­dulge them­selves.</p>
    <p>When you gam­ble or in­vest, you usu­ally know you are in trou­ble when you l ose all your money. Things won’t be­come worse if you do not bor­row and con­tinue with the los­ing streak.</p>
    <p>Over­spend­ing, on the other hand, is far more in­sid­i­ous be­cause it can hap­pen to seem­ingly re­spon­si­ble peo­ple.</p>
    <p>What makes it worse is that those who over­spend usu­ally do not re­alise they are in trou­ble un­til the debt is big enough to choke the life out of their fi­nan­cial well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>By then, it will usu­ally be too late for them to do any­thing to help them­selves.</p>
    <p>Over the past decade, Credit Coun­selling Sin­ga­pore (CCS) has seen more than 10,000 peo­ple who have fallen into fi­nan­cial trou­ble due to over­spend­ing.</p>
    <p>The num­ber rep­re­sents al­most half of all cases that the guardian an­gel for debtors has helped.</p>
    <p>Many of th­ese folks are still work­ing to pay off their debt, which range from about $50,000 to a few hun­dred thou­sand each.</p>
    <p>This fig­ure does not in­clude many oth­ers who strug­gle on their own be­cause they do not agree with the CCS’ non-ne­go­tiable con­di­tion, which is to ter­mi­nate all their credit cards.</p>
    <p>An OCBC Bank sur­vey found that close to 30 per cent of credit card hold­ers here pay only the min­i­mum sum, which means they are ac­cu­mu­lat­ing more debt every month.</p>
    <p>Over­spend­ing on daily ex­penses</p>
    <p>A com­mon myth is that peo­ple who over­spend usu­ally buy many lux­u­ri­ous items. The re­al­ity is ac­tu­ally more wor­ry­ing be­cause those in trou­ble mostly chalk up com­mon ex­penses.</p>
    <p>Here are some ex­am­ples:</p>
    <p>DIN­ING OUT</p>
    <p>Few peo­ple will opt for the cheap­est meals at hawker cen­tres when they are at work.</p>
    <p>Those work­ing in the cen­tral city area can eas­ily spend up to $20 on each meal. And if you eat out of­ten, es­pe­cially, with the whole fam­ily dur­ing week­ends, your monthly din­ing bill alone could be a few thou­sand dol­lars, if not a lot more.</p>
    <p>Don’t be­lieve it? Just keep all the re­ceipts for a month and you may be shocked.</p>
    <p>TRANS­PORT</p>
    <p>Peo­ple used to re­frain from call­ing for cabs un­less they needed to go some­where ur­gently or to the air­port. Now many hail rides the mo­ment they step out of their homes with­out re­al­is­ing they are in the process of in­cur­ring a hefty sum each month.</p>
    <p>If you do this all the time, you may ac­tu­ally be spend­ing more on trans­port than on other ex­penses.</p>
    <p>No won­der a young lo­cal bank ex­ec­u­tive, who pre­sum­ably earned a few thou­sand dol­lars a month, had to steal from a cus­tomer – she was jailed last year – all be­cause she needed more money for her trans­port and din­ing out.</p>
    <p>HOL­I­DAYS</p>
    <p>There are many folks here who used to fly out for a short get­away when­ever a long week­end beck­oned. If you ever won­dered how they could af­ford to do so when you couldn’t, it is be­cause many peo­ple charge their hol­i­days to their credit cards.</p>
    <p>It does not mat­ter even if you earn a de­cent salary – if you spend on fre­quent hol­i­days, you will find your­self short one day.</p>
    <p>In­vest re­cently fea­tured a high-in­come cou­ple who ended with debt of a few hun­dred thou­sand dol­lars, all be­cause they trav­elled too fre­quently to visit their chil­dren, who were study­ing abroad.</p>
    <p>It’s just maths</p>
    <p>You know you are go­ing to be in trou­ble soon if you earn say $6,000, but spend $6,001 every month.</p>
    <p>It does not mat­ter even if you earn 10 times more – so long as you over­spend your in­come and rely on credit cards to fund your ex­penses, the debt is go­ing to catch up sooner or later.</p>
    <p>Take a per­son who earns $5,000 a month but spends $10,000 on a fam­ily hol­i­day. If he is dis­ci­plined enough to pay $1,000 monthly and does not in­cur ad­di­tional charges, this sum will be cleared in about year.</p>
    <p>If not, this debt can eas­ily spi­ral out of con­trol due to an ex­tra 2 per cent in­ter­est that is added to the bill every month.</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple do not re­alise that it does not take a lot to put a per­son in fi­nan­cial ruin – just imag­ine you earn $60,000 a year but have a $60,000 credit card debt.</p>
    <p>Even if you don’t spend a cent for a year, which is im­pos­si­ble, you won’t be able to clear this be­cause the in­ter­est on this sum alone is more than $14,000.</p>
    <p>It is ac­tu­ally easy to end up in a debt trap if you do not clear your credit card ex­penses every month.</p>
    <p>Even if you only owe $5,000 on cards and you choose to pay only the min­i­mum sum of $50 every month, you will need more than 14 years to clear this debt. By then, you would have spent $3,800 on the in­ter­est alone.</p>
    <p>This is how all those who sought help at the CCS ended up in trou­ble, and this is why CCS needs them to cut up all their cards.</p>
    <p>So does that mean that the Christ­mas hol­i­day is go­ing to be bleak if you have to watch your ex­penses?</p>
    <p>The re­cent Covid-19 lock­downs should have taught all of us a few ways on how to have a good time at home for a whole lot less.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, a small fam­ily can have a de­li­cious and healthy meal of a whole roast chicken ($4.90) and salad for un­der $10 from a nearby su­per­mar­ket.</p>
    <p>And the fam­ily can watch many good clas­sic movies to­gether that are free on pop­u­lar stream­ing sites such as YouTube.</p>
    <p>So even if you have to cut your ex­penses, who says you can’t have fun while do­ing it?</p>
