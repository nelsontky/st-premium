    <p>Brazil’s health reg­u­la­tor An­visa on Mon­day said China’s health au­thor­i­ties are not trans­par­ent in their au­tho­ri­sa­tion of Covid-19 vac­cine for emer­gency use, a state­ment that may fur­ther in­flame po­lit­i­cal ten­sion in the South Amer­i­can coun­try.</p>
    <p>Brazil­ian Pres­i­dent Jair Bol­sonaro, a con­sis­tent China critic, has re­peat­edly cast doubt on the Coron­aVac vac­cine be­ing de­vel­oped by China’s Si­no­vac Biotech.</p>
    <p>“Brazil is the in­ter­na­tional leader in the eval­u­a­tion process for Coron­aVac,” An­visa said on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“The vac­cine has had an emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion in China since June of this year. The Chi­nese cri­te­ria for grant­ing emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion are not trans­par­ent, and there is no avail­able in­for­ma­tion about the cri­te­ria cur­rently i n use by Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties to make these de­ci­sions.”</p>
    <p>China’s For­eign Min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin yes­ter­day said China had been at­tach­ing “great im­por­tance” to the safety and ef­fi­cacy of its vac­cines.</p>
    <p>While Brazil’s health reg­u­la­tor has long been largely apo­lit­i­cal, Mr Bol­sonaro has been ap­point­ing al­lies to it in re­cent months, stok­ing fears among health pro­fes­sion­als that its de­ci­sions may be af</p>
    <p>fected by po­lit­i­cal con­sid­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>At least tens of thou­sands of peo­ple have taken the Si­no­vac vac­cine in China’s emer­gency use pro­gramme. But it has not made pub­lic de­tails of how it de­ter­mines if a Covid-19 vac­cine is qual­i­fied for emer­gency use.</p>
    <p>When asked, a Si­no­vac rep­re­sen­ta­tive re­ferred to a health of­fi­cial’s state­ment in Oc­to­ber that said the emer­gency in­oc­u­la­tion was launched af­ter strin­gent re­views and in ac­cor­dance with China’s laws and the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s rules.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine showed “very good safety and im­muno­genic­ity read­ings in phase one and phase two clin­i­cal tri­als”, he said.</p>
    <p>Coron­aVac is un­der­go­ing phase three test­ing in Brazil’s most pop­u­lous state of Sao Paulo.</p>
    <p>Its gov­er­nor, Mr Joao Do­ria, a Bol­sonaro op­po­nent, said the state ex­pected to start vac­ci­nat­ing its res­i­dents next month, though it will not use Coron­aVac un­til it is ap­proved by An­visa.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the coun­try’s lead­ing pub­lic bio­med­i­cal in­sti­tute said a na­tion­wide in­oc­u­la­tion cam­paign would be pos­si­ble only from March and would rely on the As­traZeneca vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Pres­sure has been mount­ing on Brazil­ian au­thor­i­ties to quickly make a Covid-19 vac­cine avail­able amid crit­i­cism that they have not se­cured a di­verse enough sup­ply of po­ten­tial can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>“It’s not a 100m sprint,” said Mr Marco Krieger, vice-pres­i­dent of health pro­duc­tion and in­no­va­tion at the Fiocruz in­sti­tute. “We at Fiocruz are pre­pared for a marathon.”</p>
    <p>Mr Krieger said the Rio de Janeiro-based in­sti­tute, which has a deal to pro­duce the As­traZeneca vac­cine, ex­pects to de­liver 100 mil­lion doses in the first half of next year and an­other 110 mil­lion doses in the sec­ond half. That time­frame de­pends on An­visa’s ap­proval.</p>
    <p>The As­traZeneca vac­cine was Brazil’s main bet, with a 1.9 bil­lion reais (S$495 mil­lion) deal in June se­cur­ing raw ma­te­ri­als and the trans­fer of pro­duc­tion tech­nol­ogy to Fiocruz.</p>
    <p>Although it was ini­tially the world front run­ner, the As­traZeneca vac­cine was over­taken by Pfizer’s, which be­came the first Covid-19 vac­cine to be rolled out in a mass in­oc­u­la­tion cam­paign in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Brazil has since moved to secure more than 70 mil­lion doses of the Pfizer vac­cine. But only two mil­lion would be de­liv­ered in the first three months of next year.</p>
    <p>“Only in the sec­ond half of next year will we have a level of vac­ci­na­tion cover suf­fi­cient to sig­nif­i­cantly re­duce the cir­cu­la­tion of the virus,” Mr Krieger said, adding that 30 per cent to 40 per cent of Brazil’s pop­u­la­tion could be in­oc­u­lated by the mid­dle of next year.</p>
    <p>“We’re see­ing the light at the end of the tunnel, but we’re still in the tunnel,” he said.</p>
