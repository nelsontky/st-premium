    <p>The ris­ing num­ber of “im­per­son­ation of China of­fi­cials” scams this year has spiked since the start of Oc­to­ber, po­lice said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The amount of money lost by vic­tims was not stated but fig­ures from the first half of this year showed a more than 85 per cent jump in re­ports, com­pared with the same pe­riod in 2019.</p>
    <p>Be­tween Jan­uary and June this year, over $11 mil­lion was lost and at least 224 re­ports were made. Vic­tims lost more than $7.1 mil­lion over the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>In a re­cent vari­ant of the crime, vic­tims were duped by scam­mers pos­ing as Chi­nese gov­ern­ment “po­lice” into col­lect­ing money from other in­di­vid­u­als who turned out to also be vic­tims of the de­cep­tion.</p>
    <p>To prove they were cred­i­ble, fraud­sters would e-mail fake court doc­u­ments to the vic­tims.</p>
    <p>Scam­mers us­ing the same ruse have also im­per­son­ated staff from courier com­pa­nies, telecom­mu­ni­ca­tion ser­vice providers or of­fi­cers from gov­ern­ment or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>They trick vic­tims by claim­ing that a mo­bile num­ber or bank ac­count reg­is­tered in their name is linked to a crime. They might also say that there are pend­ing court cases against the vic­tims or may ask them to as­sist in in­ves­ti­ga­tions for a crim­i­nal of­fence.</p>
    <p>Be­liev­ing that their iden­ti­ties have been stolen, vic­tims would pro­vide per­sonal de­tails, like In­ter­net bank­ing cre­den­tials, to be ab­solved of the pur­ported of­fence.</p>
    <p>They would then be told to trans­fer money and, in some cases, scam­mers would with­draw funds from the vic­tims’ bank ac­counts.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said no gov­ern­ment agency will ask for bank­ing cre­den­tials or to meet strangers to pass or re­ceive money and doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>They ad­vise the public to call a trusted friend or rel­a­tive be­fore tak­ing ac­tion, as they may be over­whelmed by emo­tion and have poor judg­ment.</p>
    <p>To trick vic­tims, scam­mers may mask their ac­tual phone num­ber and dis­play a lo­cal one. Since April 15, all in­com­ing in­ter­na­tional calls are pre­fixed with a plus sign.</p>
    <p>The public should re­main vig­i­lant when re­ceiv­ing any un­ex­pected in­ter­na­tional calls and re­ject those which spoof l ocal num­bers, said the po­lice.</p>
    <p>They should avoid dis­clos­ing any per­sonal in­for­ma­tion such as their name and pass­port de­tails.</p>
    <p>Those with in­for­ma­tion re­lated to such scams should call the po­lice hot­line on 1800-255-0000 or sub­mit it on­line at www.po­lice. gov.sg/iwit­ness. To re­ceive ad­vice about scams, the public can con­tact the anti-scam helpline on 1800722-6688 or go to www.sca­malert.sg</p>
