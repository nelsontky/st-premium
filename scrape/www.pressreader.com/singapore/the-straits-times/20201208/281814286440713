    <p>CHONGQING • Twenty years ago, Ms Wen Jun­hong saved an aban­doned dog from the streets of Chongqing in south-western China. She now shares her home with more than 1,300 dogs, and they keep on com­ing.</p>
    <p>Af­ter tak­ing in that first dog, a Pekinese she named Wen­jing – “gen­tle and quiet” in Chi­nese – Ms Wen found she could not stop.</p>
    <p>She says she was driven by wor­ries about what strays face on the streets in China, from ac­ci­dents to be­ing snatched up for the dog meat trade.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­por­tant to look af­ter th­ese dogs,” she says. “Each of us should re­spect life, and the earth is not only for hu­mans but also for all an­i­mals.”</p>
    <p>Dog own­er­ship was pre­vi­ously termed a bourgeois pas­time and banned un­der the lead­er­ship of com­mu­nist China’s founder Mao Ze­dong.</p>
    <p>Views on pets have changed dra­mat­i­cally since and own­er­ship has boomed – but the coun­try still does not have a na­tional an­i­mal wel­fare law and there are tens of mil­lions of stray dogs and cats, ac­cord­ing to char­ity An­i­mal­sAsia.</p>
    <p>Ur­ban strays are rarely ster­ilised, ex­ac­er­bat­ing the prob­lem and plac­ing more pres­sure on over­whelmed and un­der­funded an­i­mal res­cue cen­tres.</p>
    <p>As well as the aban­doned pets and strays that are reg­u­larly left in her front yard, Ms Wen says she re­ceives calls “ev­ery day to help more dogs”.</p>
    <p>And it is not just ca­nines that the 68-year-old has a soft spot for.</p>
    <p>She also lives with 100 cats, four horses and a scat­ter­ing of rab­bits and birds. “Some peo­ple say I’m a psy­chopath,” she ad­mits.</p>
    <p>Her day starts at 4am with the un­en­vi­able task of clear­ing 20 to 30 bar­rels of overnight dog waste and cook­ing over 500kg of rice, meat and veg­eta­bles for the an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>The waste gets burned in the back yard, send­ing a con­tin­u­ous plume of smoke into the sky.</p>
    <p>A hand­ful of dogs run free around the build­ing, while a teth­ered pit bull ter­rier at the back door growls and barks at strangers.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery room in the two-storey house is full of cages, piled next to and on top of one an­other.</p>
    <p>Sur­rounded by fences and locked gates, her hill­side lo­ca­tion is the lat­est in a se­ries of homes af­ter com­plaints from neigh­bours forced her and her charges to keep mov­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Wen fi­nances the op­er­a­tion with pro­ceeds from sell­ing her apart­ment, loans of up to 60,000 yuan (S$12,000) and her pen­sion and life sav­ings from an ear­lier ca­reer as an en­vi­ron­men­tal tech­ni­cian.</p>
