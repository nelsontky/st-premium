    <p>LAUSANNE • A Swiss pros­e­cu­tor said on Thurs­day that there were “in­di­ca­tions” Fifa pres­i­dent Gianni In­fantino was guilty of “un­fair man­age­ment” for us­ing a pri­vate jet, funded by foot­ball’s world body, to fly be­tween Suri­name and Switzer­land in 2017.</p>
    <p>This lat­est ac­cu­sa­tion comes af­ter a pro­ce­dure was opened on July 30 against the Swiss-Ital­ian for “in­cite­ment to abuse author­ity”, the “vi­o­la­tion of of­fi­cial se­crecy” and “ob­struc­tion of crim­i­nal pro­ceed­ings”.</p>
    <p>Spe­cial pros­e­cu­tor Ste­fan Keller has called for a crim­i­nal probe to be launched. His of­fice is­sued a state­ment that read: “On the ba­sis of the in­ves­ti­ga­tions car­ried out, Ste­fan Keller is of the opin­ion that a crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion must be opened for un­fair man­age­ment.”</p>
    <p>He is, how­ever, “not com­pe­tent to open such an in­ves­ti­ga­tion” and there­fore trans­mit­ted his con­clu­sions to the Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor’s Of­fice (MPC) of Switzer­land.</p>
    <p>Keller was ap­pointed “ex­tra­or­di­nary pros­e­cu­tor” in early July to in­ves­ti­gate sus­pi­cions of col­lu­sion be­tween Fifa and for­mer MPC chief Michael Lauber.</p>
    <p>His in­ves­ti­ga­tions re­lated to three se­cret meet­ings in 2016 and 2017 be­tween the pair.</p>
    <p>Lauber re­signed in the sum­mer while Fifa’s in­ter­nal jus­tice sys­tem cleared In­fantino in mid-Au­gust.</p>
    <p>The Fifa chief then said it was “ab­surd” to be im­pli­cated for hav­ing met a mag­is­trate, in­sist­ing he wanted to show Lauber how much the global foot­ball gov­ern­ing body had changed since the clouds of cor­rup­tion which had en­gulfed his pre­de­ces­sor Sepp Blat­ter.</p>
    <p>Fifa said on Thurs­day that it was shocked by Keller’s state­ment, claim­ing it was “both ma­li­cious and defam­a­tory in na­ture, and demon­strates his ex­treme bias”.</p>
    <p>“Nei­ther Fifa nor its pres­i­dent (has) ever been in­formed of th­ese new spu­ri­ous al­le­ga­tions and they are there­fore un­able to com­ment on them, which is prob­a­bly the in­ten­tion of the ‘spe­cial pros­e­cu­tor’,” a state­ment read.</p>
    <p>“Fifa and its pres­i­dent will ob­vi­ously take all nec­es­sary le­gal steps and reme­dies to put an end to th­ese base­less and ill-in­ten­tioned ac­cu­sa­tions.”</p>
