    <p>This has been a year of do­ing things dif­fer­ently.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has taken a lot from us, but in a strange way, it has also given a lot. It has made us stop to think about what re­ally mat­ters in life, and how we want to shape it go­ing for­ward.</p>
    <p>It has shown us what is pos­si­ble, if only we dare to try. It has shown us how strong and re­silient we can be, when push comes to shove.</p>
    <p>And it has laid bare our vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>So of­ten, we go about life with our game faces on. We want peo­ple to think we are un­fazed by what­ever life lobs at us. We put on a show of strength, even when we’re strug­gling or hav­ing a dif­fi­cult time. We pre­tend ev­ery­thing is okay, es­pe­cially when it is not.</p>
    <p>Well, this blasted pan­demic has ripped away that ve­neer. Isn’t it free­ing? To tell a friend you need to talk or vent? To ask for help? To ac­cept help? To ac­knowl­edge that it’s okay not to be okay?</p>
    <p>So, yes, we can go on and on about how the pan­demic has up­ended our lives. It has. Of that there can be no doubt. Some of us have been hit harder than oth­ers, and it is so dif­fi­cult to see the bright side of things, to find a way to move for­ward, when con­fronted by dev­as­ta­tion and loss.</p>
    <p>And yet, we do need to move for­ward, past this. With a new year start­ing soon, it’s time to gird our loins for what 2021 will bring.</p>
    <p>But first, Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>I don’t know what I’ll be do­ing; I just haven’t had time to think about it. But it looks un­likely that I’ll have the usual ham and tur­key type meal. For some rea­son, I am crav­ing spice and heat.</p>
    <p>And there are so many choices from all the home-based food busi­nesses that sprang up this year, as peo­ple turned to sell­ing food af­ter los­ing their jobs.</p>
    <p>Or I might cook. I usu­ally try not to – be­yond mak­ing stuff­ing or roast­ing pota­toes or putting to­gether a salad. I like a re­laxed Christ­mas, one where I don’t have to run around like a head­less chicken. But this year, I cooked more than I have in the last five years com­bined and it has been very sat­is­fy­ing.</p>
    <p>It could well be a huge break­fast on Christ­mas day for my par­ents and me. If I do that, then I know I’ll have some home­made crum­pets on my ta­ble be­cause, this year, I got my bread-mak­ing groove back.</p>
    <p>We’ll drink cham­pagne with our eggs and crum­pets, and I’ll toast to the fact that my par­ents are well, that they have not fallen ill with the coro­n­avirus so far. We’ll prob­a­bly Zoom or FaceTime with Mei, my sis­ter, who works in Hong Kong. This year, we did not let travel re­stric­tions stand in our way of con­nect­ing with our loved ones over­seas.</p>
    <p>For Christ­mas Eve, I might make some­thing too, some­thing man­age­able so the three of us are not sad­dled with left­overs for weeks.</p>
    <p>I might make a laksa seafood pie. Seafood for Christ­mas is not out­landish at all.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralians tuck into prawns and oys­ters at Christ­mas – it is sum­mer Down Un­der and roasts are hard to con­tem­plate in that heat.</p>
    <p>Ital­ian-Amer­i­cans have The Feast Of The Seven Fishes on Christ­mas Eve, with seven types of seafood dishes. It comes from the Ro­man Catholic tra­di­tion of not eat­ing meat on the eve of a feast day.</p>
    <p>I am not re­li­gious, but seafood sounds like a plan.</p>
    <p>Be­cause I live in Sin­ga­pore, I want my seafood pie to be vi­brant with fa­mil­iar lo­cal flavours. Hence the laksa. That should also sat­isfy my crav­ing for spice and heat.</p>
    <p>If you have an heir­loom laksa recipe, please make a proper laksa for your loved ones. I envy them. I won’t be mak­ing the rem­pah or spice paste from scratch, when store-bought is per­fectly fine. My favourite one is from Prima Taste.</p>
    <p>When I told a friend about my plan, he says sim­ply: “There can­not be too many laksa leaves.”</p>
    <p>We agree on that. I’ll use a whole 50g tray of it. While that sounds like a huge amount, there is re­ally not much left af­ter pick­ing and dis­card­ing the stems and with­ered leaves.</p>
    <p>For seafood, I will have a look at what’s fresh in the wet mar­ket or su­per­mar­ket.</p>
    <p>I chance upon trays of white­bait at the su­per­mar­ket and buy one to add to this pie. Prawns and squid too. And a thick fil­let of salmon – you want an oily fish for this, one that will not dry out.</p>
    <p>If you’re us­ing shell-on prawns, don’t waste the op­por­tu­nity to get some ex­tra flavour for free. I boil the heads and shells in wa­ter to make a quick stock to add to my pie fill­ing.</p>
    <p>The whole idea is to make a thick, richly flavoured seafood stew. It should not be too wa­tery.</p>
    <p>Wa­ter will leach from the seafood while the pie is bak­ing, so I scat­ter panko crumbs at the bot­tom of the bak­ing dish to ab­sorb as much of it as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>My par­ents love mashed pota­toes, so I use 1kg of Rus­set pota­toes for the top­ping. If you don’t want some­thing so carb-heavy, use 800g of spuds. Any less and you might not be able to cover the sur­face of the pie. You could also use half mashed pota­toes and half mashed cau­li­flower as a top­ping. Or for­get the spuds and clap a sheet of puff pas­try on top of the pie fill­ing, and slash the pas­try here and there to let the steam es­cape while it bakes.</p>
    <p>If seafood does not ap­peal to you, use bone­less chunks of chicken thigh in­stead.</p>
    <p>If laksa is not your favourite, then be in­spired by some­thing else. As­sam pedas? Thai green or red curry? Tomyum? Korma? Mala? Spice pastes for all these are eas­ily avail­able.</p>
    <p>The pos­si­bil­i­ties for seafood pie, and for life, are end­less.</p>
    <p>Merry Christ­mas.</p>
