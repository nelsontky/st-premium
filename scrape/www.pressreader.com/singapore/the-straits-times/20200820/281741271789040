    <p>SYD­NEY • Aus­tralia’s leader yes­ter­day called for coro­n­avirus im­mu­ni­sa­tions to be manda­tory, as the race to de­velop a vac­cine gath­ers pace.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Scott Morrison said he wants all 25 mil­lion Aus­tralians to get the jab after the coun­try se­cures ac­cess to a vac­cine un­der devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“There are al­ways ex­emp­tions... on med­i­cal grounds, but that should be the only ba­sis,” he said.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has signed a deal with Bri­tish drug­maker As­traZeneca to pro­duce and dis­trib­ute enough doses of its po­ten­tial vac­cine for the coun­try’s en­tire pop­u­la­tion. It will be cost-free to cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine is be­ing de­vel­oped by Bri­tain’s Uni­ver­sity of Ox­ford and li­censed to As­traZeneca.</p>
    <p>“Should we be in a po­si­tion for the tri­als to be suc­cess­ful, we would hope that this would be made avail­able early next year,” Mr Morrison said. “If it can be done sooner than that, great.”</p>
    <p>All Aus­tralians will be of­fered doses but a med­i­cal panel will de­ter­mine the pri­or­ity list.</p>
    <p>“Nat­u­rally you would be fo­cus­ing on the most vul­ner­a­ble, the el­derly, health work­ers, peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties in terms of the speed of roll­out,” Health Min­is­ter Greg Hunt told Sky News.</p>
    <p>Health au­thor­i­ties would also take into ac­count where the high­est risk of trans­mis­sion is and how the vac­cine works in dif­fer­ent age groups when de­cid­ing who should get it first, said Vic­to­ria’s chief health of­fi­cer Brett Sut­ton.</p>
    <p>“If it does work and it’s 80 to 90 per cent ef­fec­tive, then ab­so­lutely it will be a game changer,” he said, though he cau­tioned that broad test­ing was still at a pre­lim­i­nary stage.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s fresh out­break of in­fec­tions in Vic­to­ria showed fur­ther signs of eas­ing yes­ter­day, al­lay­ing fears of a na­tion­wide se­cond wave.</p>
    <p>There were 12 deaths and 216 new cases in the past 24 hours, down from more than 700 in­fec­tions two weeks ago. There were just 12 new cases in three other states.</p>
    <p>Mr Morrison said Aus­tralia was also look­ing for other vac­cine deals, in­clud­ing with the Uni­ver­sity of Queens­land and its part­ner, Aus­tralian firm CSL.</p>
    <p>He said Aus­tralia is talk­ing to its Pa­cific neigh­bours, in­clud­ing In­done­sia, Pa­pua New Guinea and Fiji, about sup­ply­ing the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Na­tions are scram­bling to gain ac­cess to vac­cine con­tenders in the fi­nal stages of clin­i­cal tri­als.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia on Aug 11 said it had de­vel­oped the world’s first vac­cine of­fer­ing “sus­tain­able im­mu­nity” and was in the fi­nal stage of hu­man test­ing. But the news was met with scep­ti­cism by the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, which said it still needed a rig­or­ous re­view.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists also pointed out that Rus­sia’s vac­cine had been ap­proved with­out large-scale tri­als.</p>
    <p>Brazil­ian health reg­u­la­tors on Tues­day green-lighted the fi­nal stage of tri­als on a vac­cine by John­son & John­son. The US firm will test its drug on 7,000 vol­un­teers in Brazil, part of a group of up to 60,000 world­wide.</p>
    <p>South Africa will this week launch clin­i­cal tri­als of a US-de­vel­oped vac­cine with 2,900 vol­un­teers.</p>
    <p>But the push for a vac­cine has co­in­cided with a rise in anti-vac­cine sen­ti­ment that could hin­der ef­forts to en­cour­age wide­spread up­take.</p>
    <p>The global out­break has seen a sharp rise in on­line mis­in­for­ma­tion and op­po­si­tion, with de­bate rag­ing over whether vac­cine rules im­pinge on per­sonal free­doms.</p>
