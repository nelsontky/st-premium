    <p>OR­LANDO The Los An­ge­les Lak­ers might have only two Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) All­Stars in LeBron James and Anthony Davis, but coach Frank Vo­gel be­lieves the team’s de­fence makes them a su­perteam.</p>
    <p>Davis recorded a double-double,</p>
    <p>James flirted with a triple-double and the Lak­ers par­layed a sti­fling de­fen­sive per­for­mance into a 110-100, wire-to-wire vic­tory over the Hous­ton Rock­ets in Game 4 of their Western Con­fer­ence semi-fi­nal se­ries on Thurs­day at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Com­plex near Or­lando.</p>
    <p>The Lak­ers grabbed a com­mand­ing 3-1 se­ries lead by dominating the facets of the game that fit their sea­son-long pro­file: They clob­bered the Rock­ets on the glass as Hous­ton fin­ished with a mi­nus-26 re­bound­ing mar­gin, over­whelmed them in the paint 62-24 and torched Hous­ton in tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>“That’s as pow­er­ful a weapon there is in one of these play-off runs. It’s as pow­er­ful as a su­per­star,” Vo­gel said of his side’s de­fence. “If you have an elite de­fence, that can be your third star, so to speak.”</p>
    <p>The Rock­ets made just four field goals in the sec­ond quar­ter and fin­ished the half three-of-13 from three-point range.</p>
    <p>“We played de­fence. We did a good job of de­fend­ing the three,” said Davis, who paired 29 points with 12 re­bounds and added five as­sists and two blocks.</p>
    <p>“For the most part, we ex­e­cuted our game plan.”</p>
    <p>That plan in­cluded lim­it­ing Rock­ets star James Har­den, who en­tered Game 4 av­er­ag­ing 32 points in the se­ries, on of­fence.</p>
    <p>The Lak­ers trapped Hous­ton’s star guard 17 times in the pick-an­droll and the guard fin­ished with just 21 points on 18 per cent shoot­ing with 10 as­sists. Rus­sell West­brook added 25 points.</p>
    <p>“(Har­den) is prob­a­bly one of the best offensive play­ers that we’ve ever seen in this league,” James said, af­ter con­tribut­ing 16 points, 15 re­bounds and nine as­sists.</p>
    <p>“So we’re just try­ing to elim­i­nate any­thing that we can from him.”</p>
    <p>Su­perteams – with at least three All-Star play­ers – have won two of the last three NBA ti­tles.</p>
    <p>While the Lak­ers failed to con­vince the reign­ing NBA Fi­nals Most Valu­able Player Kawhi Leonard to join them, they could reach their first Western Con­fer­ence Fi­nals since the 2009-10 sea­son with a Game 5 win to­day.</p>
