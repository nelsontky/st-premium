    <p>HONG KONG • Pro-democ­racy ac­tivist Joshua Wong was re­manded in cus­tody yes­ter­day af­ter plead­ing guilty to charges of or­gan­is­ing and in­cit­ing an unau­tho­rised assem­bly near the Hong Kong po­lice head­quar­ters dur­ing last year’s anti-gov­ern­ment protests.</p>
    <p>Wong, who was just 17 years old when he be­came the face of the 2014 stu­dent-led Um­brella Move­ment democ­racy protests, could be jailed up to three years. The sen­tence will be de­liv­ered by Dec 2.</p>
    <p>Be­fore be­ing taken away by se­cu­rity, Wong shouted: “Ev­ery­one hang in there! Add oil!” – a pop­u­lar Can­tonese ex­pres­sion of en­cour­age­ment used dur­ing protests.</p>
    <p>On Twit­ter af­ter­wards, Wong said at­ten­tion should be di­rected to the 12 Hong Kong people de­tained vir­tu­ally in­com­mu­ni­cado in China af­ter be­ing ar­rested at sea in Au­gust while try­ing to flee to Tai­wan to es­cape charges re­lated to last year’s protests.</p>
    <p>“I wish to pay trib­ute to our fel­low ac­tivists who are about to face tri­als and prison, or...(are) in dis­tress for not be­ing able to re­turn home: We’re not fear­less, but you are the braver ones,” he said.</p>
    <p>Wong did not plead guilty to a third charge of know­ingly par­tic­i­pat­ing in an unau­tho­rised assem­bly af­ter the pros­e­cu­tion of­fered no ev­i­dence for it.</p>
    <p>His long-time ac­tivist col­leagues Agnes Chow and Ivan Lam, who also pleaded guilty to sim­i­lar charges, were re­manded in cus­tody at the same trial.</p>
    <p>Dozens of sup­port­ers out­side the court chanted pro-democ­racy slo­gans and “Re­lease Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow, Ivan Lam”.</p>
    <p>Wong was not a lead­ing fig­ure in last year’s pro-democ­racy and anti-China protests, but his con­tin­ued ac­tivism has drawn the wrath of Bei­jing, which sees him as a “black hand” of for­eign forces.</p>
    <p>He dis­banded his pro-democ­racy group De­mo­sisto in June, just hours af­ter China’s Par­lia­ment passed a sweep­ing na­tional se­cu­rity law for Hong Kong, pun­ish­ing any­thing Bei­jing con­sid­ers to be sub­ver­sion, se­ces­sion, ter­ror­ism and col­lu­sion with for­eign forces, with up to life in prison.</p>
    <p>Wong also faces charges of par­tic­i­pat­ing in an unau­tho­rised assem­bly in Oc­to­ber last year and on June 4 this year over a vigil com­mem­o­rat­ing the crack­down on pro­test­ers i n and around Bei­jing’s Tianan­men Square in 1989.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, Wong was dis­qual­i­fied, along with 11 other prodemoc­racy politi­cians and ac­tivists, from run­ning in a sin­ce­post­poned elec­tion for the city’s leg­is­la­ture. The young ac­tivist spent five weeks in jail last year for con­tempt of court, be­fore be­ing re­leased on June 16, when protests were al­ready in full swing.</p>
    <p>The re­peated ar­rests of Wong and other ac­tivists have drawn crit­i­cism from Western gov­ern­ments which say China is not ful­fill­ing its obli­ga­tion to al­low Hong Kong a high de­gree of au­ton­omy, as agreed with for­mer colo­nial master Bri­tain when the city re­turned to Chi­nese rule in 1997.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a group of Western en­voys to Hong Kong has con­demned the ero­sion of me­dia free­doms in the city, a sit­u­a­tion they say has been wors­ened by Bei­jing’s im­po­si­tion of the “vaguely de­fined” na­tional se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>In a joint opin­ion piece in the South China Morn­ing Post, the con­suls-gen­eral for the United States, Canada, Bri­tain and Aus­tralia warned of the ris­ing risks for jour­nal­ists op­er­at­ing in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The city’s jour­nal­ists have been work­ing through an ex­tended bout of po­lit­i­cal tur­moil since large, some­times-vi­o­lent protests broke out last year, fol­lowed by China’s de­ci­sion to im­pose the new se­cu­rity mea­sures.</p>
    <p>China de­nies curb­ing rights and free­dom in the city, and, ear­lier this month, told a “hand­ful of for­eign politi­cians to grasp the trend of the times, keep their hands off China’s in­ter­nal af­fairs, stop med­dling with Hong Kong af­fairs in any form and avoid go­ing far­ther down the wrong path”.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese for­eign min­istry also said the le­gal ba­sis for the cen­tral gov­ern­ment’s ad­min­is­tra­tion of Hong Kong is the Con­sti­tu­tion of China and Hong Kong’s Ba­sic Law.</p>
