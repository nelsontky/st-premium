    <p>The Shinzo Abe era has also been the Xi Jin­ping era.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent lead­ers of Ja­pan and China took power within weeks of each other. Mr Abe was elected as prime minister of Ja­pan in December 2012 at the age of 58. Just a month ear­lier, Mr Xi had been ap­pointed gen­eral sec­re­tary of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party, at age 59.</p>
    <p>This was more than a coin­ci­dence of tim­ing. Mr Abe’s cen­tral task – as de­scribed by his clos­est ad­vis­ers – was to strengthen Ja­pan to cope with an in­creas­ingly pow­er­ful and au­thor­i­tar­ian China.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese Prime Minister is now step­ping down due to ill health, with his task in­com­plete.</p>
    <p>He has played a dif­fi­cult hand with some skill and de­ter­mi­na­tion. But the un­com­fort­able truth is that Ja­pan’s strate­gic dilemma can­not be re­solved by Tokyo alone. In the end, the coun­try’s fate may de­pend on po­lit­i­cal de­vel­op­ments that are be­yond its con­trol – in the United States and in Mr Xi’s China.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the Xi era, it has be­come clear that China is in­tent on be­com­ing the dom­i­nant power in Asia – and, per­haps, the world.</p>
    <p>HARSH RE­AL­I­TIES</p>
    <p>Wor­ry­ingly for any gov­ern­ment in Tokyo, mod­ern Chi­nese na­tion­al­ism is suf­fused with anti-Ja­panese sen­ti­ment – dat­ing back to Ja­pan’s in­va­sion and bru­tal­i­sa­tion of China in the 1930s.</p>
    <p>The two coun­tries still have a ter­ri­to­rial dis­pute and their planes and ships of­ten chal­lenge each other, around the is­lands that the Ja­panese call the Senkakus and the Chi­nese call the Diaoyu.</p>
    <p>Any Ja­panese prime minister shap­ing a re­sponse to a ris­ing China</p>
    <p>has to work with un­promis­ing raw ma­te­rial. Ja­pan’s pop­u­la­tion is age­ing and shrink­ing and the coun­try’s na­tional debt is colos­sal.</p>
    <p>China’s econ­omy be­came larger than that of Ja­pan a decade ago and con­tin­ues to grow at a faster rate. Bei­jing is pour­ing money into new war­ships and missiles at a pace that Ja­pan can­not match.</p>
    <p>China also faces a de­mo­graphic chal­lenge, as its own pop­u­la­tion ages. But the fact re­mains that the Chi­nese pop­u­la­tion is more than 10 times the size of Ja­pan’s – and the asym­me­try in power between the two na­tions grows wider ev­ery year.</p>
    <p>Paci­fist sen­ti­ment is also deeply em­bed­ded in Ja­pan. Chang­ing the Ja­panese Con­sti­tu­tion to al­low his coun­try’s troops to fight over­seas has proved to be po­lit­i­cally im­pos­si­ble for Mr Abe.</p>
    <p>Faced with these re­al­i­ties, it would be tempt­ing for a Ja­panese gov­ern­ment to adopt a pol­icy of ap­pease­ment of Bei­jing. But any such pol­icy would even­tu­ally come at a heavy price in Ja­panese free­dom and au­ton­omy.</p>
    <p>It is far from clear that China’s ter­ri­to­rial am­bi­tions would stop at the un­in­hab­ited Senkaku-Diaoyu is­lands. There are think-tanks and gov­ern­ment-backed news­pa­pers in Bei­jing that have also ques­tioned Ja­panese sovereignt­y over Ok­i­nawa – which has a pop­u­la­tion of</p>
    <p>1.4 mil­lion and which hosts</p>
    <p>Amer­ica’s most im­por­tant mil­i­tary base in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>More broadly, many Chi­nese na­tion­al­ists would love to gain a sym­bolic re­venge for the 1930s by rel­e­gat­ing Ja­pan to the level of a trib­u­tary state.</p>
    <p>SYM­BOLIC ACT OF SUB­MIS­SION</p>
    <p>Un­der­stand­ing all this, Mr Abe has not made any con­ces­sions on the is­lands dis­pute. He knows that any uni­lat­eral step back­wards would be seen in Bei­jing as a sym­bolic act of sub­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>But, even as he has stood firm on the is­lands, Mr Abe has man­aged to ease ten­sions with Pres­i­dent Xi. The Ja­panese Prime Minister paid a suc­cess­ful visit to Bei­jing last December. Mr Xi was due to pay a state visit to Ja­pan this year but it was de­layed by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>It would be fool­ish to as­sume that this im­prove­ment in re­la­tions is per­ma­nent.</p>
    <p>Fac­ing dif­fi­cul­ties with the US over trade, Tai­wan and the South China Sea – Mr Xi could be seek­ing a tem­po­rary rap­proche­ment with Ja­pan. China may also sniff the pos­si­bil­ity of even­tu­ally lur­ing Ja­pan to­wards a more neu­tral stance in Bei­jing’s own strug­gle with Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>If US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump con­tin­ues to threaten Ja­pan with trade sanc­tions, and to cast doubt on the US-Ja­pan al­liance, anti-Amer­i­can sen­ti­ment could rise in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>The er­ratic na­ture of the Trump pres­i­dency has cer­tainly made life more dif­fi­cult for Mr Abe. One of Mr Trump’s first acts as pres­i­dent was to pull the US out of the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (TPP) – a multi­na­tional trade deal the Abe gov­ern­ment had put huge en­ergy into ne­go­ti­at­ing.</p>
    <p>Rather than go away and sulk, Mr Abe threw his en­er­gies into re­build­ing re­la­tions with the White House and re­cre­at­ing the TPP as a new deal (the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship), with all the orig­i­nal sig­na­to­ries bar Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe was the first for­eign leader through the door of Trump Tower to con­grat­u­late the Pres­i­dent af­ter his elec­tion vic­tory in 2016. His slightly ob­se­quious pos­ture may have been hum­bling, but it served a broader strate­gic pur­pose.</p>
    <p>At the same time, Mr Abe has cul­ti­vated new friends – in par­tic­u­lar, Mr Naren­dra Modi, the Prime Minister of In­dia. Ja­pan is pro­mot­ing a “free and open Indo-Pa­cific”, in which the re­gion’s democ­ra­cies work together. The im­plied con­trast is with a closed and au­thor­i­tar­ian Asia-Pa­cific that might emerge if Chi­nese power is un­con­tested.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe has made many of the right strate­gic moves for his coun­try. But he leaves of­fice with­out know­ing whether his ef­forts will ul­ti­mately be crowned with suc­cess.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to the rise of China is a gen­er­a­tional chal­lenge for Ja­pan. Mr Abe’s suc­ces­sors will need luck, as well as skill, to nav­i­gate an un­cer­tain fu­ture.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese Prime Minister is now step­ping down due to ill health, with his task in­com­plete. He has played a dif­fi­cult hand with some skill and de­ter­mi­na­tion. But the un­com­fort­able truth is that Ja­pan’s strate­gic dilemma can­not be re­solved by Tokyo alone. In the end, the coun­try’s fate may de­pend on po­lit­i­cal de­vel­op­ments that are be­yond its con­trol – in the US and in Mr Xi’s China.</p>
