    <p>WASHINGTON • North Korean hack­ers are tapping into banks around the globe to make fraud­u­lent money trans­fers and cause ATMs to spit out cash, the United States gov­ern­ment has warned.</p>
    <p>A tech­ni­cal cy­ber-se­cu­rity alert jointly writ­ten by four dif­fer­ent fed­eral agen­cies, in­clud­ing the Trea­sury Depart­ment and Fed­eral Bu­reau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion, said there had been a resur­gence in fi­nan­cially mo­ti­vated hack­ing ef­forts by the North Korean regime this year af­ter a lull in ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>“Since Fe­bru­ary 2020, North Korea has re­sumed tar­get­ing banks in mul­ti­ple coun­tries to ini­ti­ate fraud­u­lent in­ter­na­tional money trans­fers and ATM cashouts,” the warn­ing reads.</p>
    <p>US law enforcemen­t ti­tled the cam­paign “Fast Cash” and blamed North Korea’s Re­con­nais­sance Gen­eral Bu­reau, a spy agency, for it. It de­scribed the op­er­a­tion as go­ing on since at least 2016, but ramp­ing up in so­phis­ti­ca­tion and vol­ume re­cently.</p>
    <p>Over the past sev­eral years, North Korea has been blamed by US au­thor­i­ties and pri­vate cy­ber-se­cu­rity com­pa­nies for hack­ing nu­mer­ous banks in Asia, South Amer­ica and Africa.</p>
    <p>“North Korean cy­ber ac­tors have demon­strated an imag­i­na­tive knack for ad­just­ing their tac­tics to ex­ploit the fi­nan­cial sec­tor, as well as any other sec­tor through il­licit cy­ber op­er­a­tions,” Mr Bryan Ware, a se­nior cy­ber-se­cu­rity of­fi­cial at the US Home­land Se­cu­rity Depart­ment, said in a state­ment on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Cy­ber-se­cu­rity ex­perts and for­eign pol­icy an­a­lysts have said th­ese types of hack­ing op­er­a­tions are con­ducted to help fund the North Korean gov­ern­ment, which is cash­strapped due to ex­pan­sive sanc­tions con­tin­u­ously placed on it by the US and other Western coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“The con­tin­ued at­tacks are proof of the re­liance the regime has on th­ese funds, along with be­ing a tes­ta­ment to their tech­ni­cal abil­ity and de­ter­mi­na­tion,” US cy­ber-se­cu­rity firm Sy­man­tec tech­ni­cal direc­tor Vikram Thakur said.</p>
