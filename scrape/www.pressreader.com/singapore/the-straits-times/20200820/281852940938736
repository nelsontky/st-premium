    <p>NEW YORK • Gold­man Sachs Group and Malaysia signed an agree­ment to fi­nalise the bank’s US$3.9 bil­lion (S$5.32 bil­lion) set­tle­ment over the 1Malaysia Devel­op­ment Ber­had (1MDB) scan­dal.</p>
    <p>The US bank, which had an­nounced an agree­ment in prin­ci­ple on July 24, con­firmed the for­mal ac­cord in a reg­u­la­tory fil­ing late on Tues­day in New York.</p>
    <p>The firm must make a US$2.5 bil­lion cash pay­ment to Malaysia within 10 days, peo­ple with knowl­edge of the mat­ter said this week, ask­ing not to be iden­ti­fied as the in­for­ma­tion is pri­vate.</p>
    <p>The pact marks a ma­jor step to­wards re­solv­ing the scan­dal sur­round­ing 1MDB, a Malaysian state fund that is at the cen­tre of global in­ves­ti­ga­tions into cor­rup­tion and money-laun­der­ing.</p>
    <p>The deal an­nounced last month called for Gold­man to pay US$2.5 bil­lion while guar­an­tee­ing the re­turn of US$1.4 bil­lion of 1MDB as­sets seized by the au­thor­i­ties around the world, in ex­change for Malaysia drop­ping charges against the bank.</p>
    <p>The deal helps the bank move on from its worst scan­dal since the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, while Malaysia gets to re­coup much of the US$4.5 bil­lion that prose­cu­tors said was lost from 1MDB at a time when it was seek­ing funds for its mas­sive stim­u­lus pack­age.</p>
    <p>Over much of a decade, 1MDB has be­come short­hand for one of the world’s most dar­ing heists – a con­spir­acy that spawned probes in Asia, the United States and Europe.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties spent years track­ing funds that al­legedly flowed from 1MDB into high-end art and real es­tate, a su­per yacht and, iron­i­cally, the hit Hol­ly­wood movie The Wolf Of Wall Street, chron­i­cling an ear­lier era of fi­nan­cial crimes.</p>
    <p>The case against the bank fo­cused on its work rais­ing US$6.5 bil­lion in 2012 and 2013 for the fund, much of which was al­legedly si­phoned off by peo­ple con­nected to the coun­try’s for­mer prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak.</p>
    <p>Na­jib was last month jailed for 12 years after be­ing con­victed on all seven charges in the first of sev­eral tri­als re­lated to 1MDB.</p>
    <p>The scan­dal’s al­leged mas­ter­mind, jet-set­ting Malaysian fi­nancier Low Taek Jho, has also been charged in Malaysia and the</p>
    <p>US. Low de­nies any wrong­do­ing, and his where­abouts are un­known.</p>
    <p>Gold­man’s in­vest­ment bank­ing group, led at the time by now-chief ex­ec­u­tive David Solomon, col­lected an un­usu­ally high US$600 mil­lion from the bond sales.</p>
    <p>The pact does not re­solve other pend­ing gov­ern­men­tal and reg­u­la­tory probes re­lated to 1MDB, in­clud­ing one from the US Depart­ment of Jus­tice.</p>
