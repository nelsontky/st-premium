    <p>Fans of Kki Sweets’ fine, Ja­pane­sein­spired cakes will have fol­lowed Ken­neth Seah and Del­phine Liau’s busi­ness from Ann Siang Hill to the cam­pus of the School of the Arts (Sota), before the trail went cold and they were left cake-less.</p>
    <p>Not any­more. Kki has opened at Raf­fles Ho­tel, with the shopfront along Seah Street.</p>
    <p>This new in­car­na­tion is a dessert restau­rant that seats 15 with so­cial dis­tanc­ing, and there are eight cakes and three plated desserts on the menu.</p>
    <p>There is no dis­play case of cakes and no take­away ex­cept for whole cakes, which have to be or­dered in ad­vance.</p>
    <p>In­stead, cus­tomers step into a long space filled with nat­u­ral light. Most of them will sit at the long ta­ble, punc­tu­ated in the mid­dle by plants, un­der a white, tent-like canopy that soars to the high ceil­ing.</p>
    <p>There, they can en­joy the del­i­cate cakes that self-taught baker Mr Seah, 48, is known for, to­gether with sen­cha or rooi­bos tea from Ja­pan’s Lupi­cia, and pourover cof­fee with beans from Sin­ga­pore’s Tiong Hoe.</p>
    <p>The lo­ca­tion of the restau­rant in Seah Street marks a strange sort of home­com­ing for Mr Seah. He be­longs to the Seah Clan, Sin­ga­pore pi­o­neers who were plan­ta­tion own­ers, traders and mer­chants.</p>
    <p>That street is named for the fam­ily. Eu Chin Street, Peck Seah Street and Liang Seah Street are also named for the Seah clan’s most prom­i­nent mem­bers.</p>
    <p>On open­ing the new Kki dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, Mr Seah says: “We planned this before the pan­demic, so there was no turn­ing back. Good thing we didn’t open before Chi­nese New Year.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, we took our time. Our kitchen was up, so we could do R&D.”</p>
    <p>The cou­ple, who have t wo daugh­ters aged nine and three, are bat­tle-proven.</p>
    <p>Their story is one of tenac­ity. They have weath­ered ev­ery­thing that the bru­tal in­dus­try has lobbed at them i n the 10 years since start­ing Kki, named after the Ja­panese way of say­ing “cake”.</p>
    <p>A dou­bling of rent in their Ann Siang Hill shop forced them to close after four suc­cess­ful years.</p>
    <p>“The space was va­cant for five years,” Ms Liau, 43, says.</p>
    <p>They moved to Sota in the Bras Basah arts dis­trict. Cus­tomers had a tough time find­ing t hem. The lo­ca­tion was not ideal.</p>
    <p>And when the econ­omy started slow­ing down, they tried to make things work with de­sign and re­tail col­lab­o­ra­tions, but had to shut­ter the store in early 2017.</p>
    <p>Ms Liau did events man­age­ment work and Mr Seah set up and ran the pas­try kitchen for another brand.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers who hunted them down asked point­edly for them to re­open.</p>
    <p>“Cus­tomers we saw at Ann Siang who were dat­ing then are now mar­ried with kids,” Mr Seah says. “Kki is part of their lives.”</p>
    <p>One of them, how­ever, didn’t just ask. She de­cided to back them, in­vest­ing a six-fig­ure sum.</p>
    <p>“She asked ‘How much do you need?’,” Ms Liau says. “We found the lo­ca­tion and sold her the idea in three days. She un­der­stood that we wanted to build a cul­ture out of the busi­ness, not to scale it.”</p>
    <p>And part of the new Kki is that there are no sump­tu­ous dis­plays of cakes. The cou­ple have good reasons for that.</p>
    <p>Mr Seah says: “All these years, we’ve been a typ­i­cal cake shop. But if we prep cakes in the morn­ing, by evening, they are not fresh. What we can’t sell, we have to throw.</p>
    <p>“Now, we run Kki like a restau­rant. We take reser­va­tions. We can now have com­po­nents like del­i­cate tu­iles and soft fresh fruit on the cakes. And there is no wastage.”</p>
    <p>The cakes and plated desserts are as­sem­bled upon or­der­ing, and din­ers will have to or­der at least one cake and one plated dessert each.</p>
    <p>Loyal fans who have sup­ported the brand through the years might also get a re­ward.</p>
    <p>Ms Liau says: “They have been bug­ging us to bring back old cakes such as the An­toinette, Mont Blanc and Kin­abaru. They tell us these were the cakes they had on their first dates.”</p>
    <p>These cou­ples might get their wish next year.</p>
    <p>“It’s our 11th year and we’ll do a throw­back – for a month, of­fer the first menu we did,” Ms Liau says.</p>
    <p>The restau­rant is the show­case for Mr Seah’s artistry, a place to hone cake cul­ture in Sin­ga­pore and groom new pas­try chefs.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple have hired pas­try chef Lin Ji­awen, 36, who went from a ca­reer in cor­po­rate mar­ket­ing to culi­nary school, to work along­side Mr Seah.</p>
    <p>Ms Liau says: “Kids are going to pas­try school and are not get­ting hired here after grad­u­a­tion, so they go over­seas. We need to keep the tal­ent here.”</p>
    <p>But, after a decade of keep­ing their dream alive, they know the restau­rant can­not be the only el­e­ment in their port­fo­lio.</p>
    <p>Ms Liau will start a busi­ness sell­ing ed­i­ble sou­venirs that mine Sin­ga­pore food cul­ture, with pack­ag­ing de­signed by lo­cal tal­ent.</p>
    <p>“Our Mer­lion choco­lates are not made here,” she says. “I want to do something that rep­re­sents us.”</p>
    <p>Kki Sweets at 3 Seah Street, 01-01, is open from 11am to 7pm (Wed­nes­days to Satur­days), 11am to 5pm (Sun­days), and closed Mon­days and Tues­days. What­sApp 9799-2668 to make reser­va­tions.</p>
