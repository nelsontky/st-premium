    <p>KEEN TO PLAY</p>
    <p>It’s been a while. I felt the same ea­ger­ness, edgi­ness, ner­vous­ness. And it was good. I was a lit­tle bit rusty, but over­all it was a good start. ’’</p>
    <p>TIGER WOODS, on his first PGA Tour round af­ter five months.</p>
    <p>DUBLIN (Ohio) • Play­ing his first hole on the PGA Tour in 151 days, Tiger Woods on Thurs­day smashed a driver 327 yards off the tee, hit his ap­proach shot from 145 yards to within 10 feet and then sank a curl­ing, down­hill birdie putt.</p>
    <p>He walked off the green with a be­mused ex­pres­sion that seemed to say: “What? This is sup­posed to be hard?”</p>
    <p>Two holes later, he was at it again, knock­ing a wedge shot from 107 yards that landed on a dev­il­ishly con­toured green and stopped 13 inches from the hole for an­other birdie.</p>
    <p>The rest of the day was not quite a romp to the top of the leader­board at the Me­mo­rial Tour­na­ment, where Woods is a record five-time cham­pion. But by any mea­sure it was still a suc­cess, es­pe­cially since the 15-time Ma­jor cham­pion, play­ing on the Tour for the first time in five months be­cause of in­juries and the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, looked fit and his swing re­laxed and fluid.</p>
    <p>He fin­ished the day at the Muir­field Vil­lage Golf Club with a one-un­der 71, good enough to tie him for 18th, five strokes be­hind first-round leader and fel­low Amer­i­can Tony Finau, who has a one-shot lead over Ryan Palmer. Bren­dan Steele and 2019 US Open cham­pion Gary</p>
    <p>Wood­land l urk two back af­ter rounds of 68.</p>
    <p>“It’s been a while,” Woods said with a grin af­ter­wards. “I felt the same ea­ger­ness, edgi­ness, ner­vous­ness. And it was good. I was a lit­tle bit rusty, but over­all it was a good start.”</p>
    <p>It was also his first round in the closed-door en­vi­ron­ment the Tour has im­ple­mented since it re­sumed play on June 11 af­ter a three-month hia­tus.</p>
    <p>At times, he ap­peared al­most pre­oc­cu­pied by the paucity of dis­trac­tions in the Tour’s new set­ting, which will not have fans for the rest of the sea­son. He fre­quently searched the empty hill­sides next to fair­ways as if long­ing for the gal­leries he nor­mally at­tracts. Oc­ca­sion­ally, he made eye con­tact with the roughly two dozen Tour of­fi­cials, vol­un­teers and me­dia that fol­lowed him – never as a pro had such a small gag­gle of peo­ple ac­com­pa­nied him on a round.</p>
    <p>“There were still a lot of mov­ing carts and a lot of me­dia that were mov­ing around, but the en­ergy wasn’t the same with­out the fans,” Woods con­ceded. “It’s a dif­fer­ent feel. But a new re­al­ity.”</p>
    <p>Still, renowned for his steely de­ter­mi­na­tion, he in­sisted he never lost his fun­da­men­tal fo­cus.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t have any is­sues with en­ergy or not hav­ing fans’ re­ac­tions out there,” he said, adding that he even en­joyed the less chaotic walks be­tween holes be­cause of the lack of spec­ta­tors.</p>
    <p>His re­turn to the Tour was more about as­sess­ing his fit­ness level and the over­all health of his game than as­sign­ing a score for con­sis­tency.</p>
    <p>By that mea­sure, Woods’ 18 holes should be en­tirely en­cour­ag­ing to his le­gion of fans. There was none of the un­gainly, awk­ward strides so ev­i­dent dur­ing his last event in Fe­bru­ary when he fin­ished last among those who made the cut at the Ge­n­e­sis In­vi­ta­tional and later blamed stiff­ness in his sur­gi­cally re­con­structed back.</p>
    <p>Asked if he ex­pected any dif­fi­culty play­ing and walk­ing 18 holes for four straight days, Woods said em­phat­i­cally: “No. I’ve got­ten ready for this.”</p>
