    <p>As Sin­ga­pore en­ters the third day of phase three of its re­open­ing, more peo­ple are mak­ing plans to go out in larger groups of eight, up from the pre­vi­ous limit of five.</p>
    <p>But some are un­clear if pa­trons are al­lowed to share ta­bles when din­ing out, while keep­ing to the rule of eight. Here are an­swers to this and other ques­tions.</p>
    <p>Q Am I al­lowed to share a ta­ble with other din­ers at hawker cen­tres, es­pe­cially dur­ing peak hours when it is more crowded?</p>
    <p>A A 1m safe dis­tance must be kept be­tween dif­fer­ent din­ing groups, should pa­trons wish to dine with other groups at hawker cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Each din­ing group must also com­prise not more than eight peo­ple. Ta­bles with more than eight seats will still have some seats marked out to en­sure that this is closely fol­lowed. Mark­ings on seats and ta­bles in hawker cen­tres have been re­vised to ac­com­mo­date the in­crease in din­ing group size.</p>
    <p>Where seats at ad­ja­cent ta­bles are less than 1m apart, some seats may be marked out to en­sure that a safe dis­tance is still main­tained be­tween groups at dif­fer­ent ta­bles.</p>
    <p>Safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors will con­tinue to be de­ployed at places like hawker cen­tres to en­sure com­pli­ance with safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Q My house­hold con­sists of more than eight peo­ple. Can we all go out to­gether since we are from the same house­hold?</p>
    <p>A As it is dif­fi­cult to easily tell in a pub­lic set­ting if a group of more than eight is from the same house­hold, res­i­dents will need to ad­here to the group size lim­its in pub­lic set­tings when go­ing out to­gether, even if they come from the same house­hold.</p>
    <p>Keep­ing to group size lim­its in pub­lic set­tings is important so as to not in­ad­ver­tently en­cour­age oth­ers, who may come from dif­fer­ent house­holds, to gather in groups that are larger than eight.</p>
    <p>The group size limit is meant to min­imise in­ter­ac­tion and the risk of trans­mis­sion across dif­fer­ent house­holds.</p>
    <p>Q Do I still need to main­tain a 1m safe dis­tance from other groups while queue­ing? Why?</p>
    <p>A Yes. As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Alex Cook, vice-dean of re­search at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, ex­plains: “With greater eas­ing of re­stric­tions, more min­gling of peo­ple in larger groups, and po­ten­tial eas­ing of bor­der re­stric­tions to allow for more travel in and out of the coun­try, the num­ber of Covid-19 cases can be ex­pected to in­crease slightly.”</p>
    <p>Hence, to con­tain any small clus­ters that might mush­room and lower the chances of com­mu­nity spread be­tween groups, it is para­mount that safe dis­tanc­ing be­tween groups and other safe man­age­ment mea­sures such as mask wear­ing are strictly ad­hered to in phase three. This will guard against an ac­cel­er­ated spread, which is now more likely to oc­cur, Prof Cook says.</p>
    <p>Q What if I go to a su­per­mar­ket or a food and bev­er­age out­let, and there are too many peo­ple in­side or in the queue for me to prac­tise the 1m safe dis­tanc­ing?</p>
    <p>A Fol­low the in­struc­tions of the staff on where and how to queue.</p>
    <p>Al­ter­na­tively, you may go to another shop, if pos­si­ble, or re­turn later at a less busy time.</p>
    <p>Q What if some­one out­side my group comes close to me in a pub­lic place? Will I be pun­ished?</p>
    <p>A En­force­ment of­fi­cers will as­sess the facts of each case care­fully. How­ever, they will not hes­i­tate to take ac­tion against egre­gious breaches.</p>
