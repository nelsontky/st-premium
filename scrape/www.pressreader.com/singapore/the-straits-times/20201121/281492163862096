    <p>Lead­ers from 21 Asia-Pa­cific economies yes­ter­day vowed to re­dou­ble ef­forts to free up trade across the Pa­cific Ocean.</p>
    <p>The Asia-Pa­cific Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion (Apec) lead­ers said more had to be done to foster an en­abling en­vi­ron­ment for trade and in­vest­ment in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>“We recog­nise the im­por­tance of a free, open, fair, non-dis­crim­i­na­tory, trans­par­ent and pre­dictable trade and in­vest­ment en­vi­ron­ment to drive eco­nomic re­cov­ery at such a chal­leng­ing time,” they said in their dec­la­ra­tion fol­low­ing their an­nual year-end sum­mit.</p>
    <p>“In this re­gard, we reaf­firm our sup­port for agreed-upon rules of the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) in pro­mot­ing the sta­bil­ity and pre­dictabil­ity of in­ter­na­tional trade flows,” they added.</p>
    <p>The vir­tual meet­ing chaired by Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin saw dis­cus­sions fo­cused on com­bat­ing the pan­demic, which has eclipsed trade ten­sions.</p>
    <p>Stress­ing the im­por­tance of a mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing sys­tem with the WTO at its core, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping said: “Our eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion has never been a zero-sum po­lit­i­cal game i n which one gains at the ex­pense of the other. Rather, our co­op­er­a­tion has pro­vided us with a de­vel­op­ment plat­form to en­sure what we each do can be mu­tu­ally re­in­forc­ing and ben­e­fi­cial to all.”</p>
    <p>He added that China will favourably con­sider join­ing the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (CPTPP) – days af­ter Bei­jing joined all 10 Asean mem­bers, Aus­tralia, Ja­pan, South Korea and New Zealand in ink­ing the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP) mega trade pact.</p>
    <p>Both the CPTPP and RCEP are seen as build­ing blocks of a larger Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pa­cific that Apec has set as a goal.</p>
    <p>Out­go­ing United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s re­marks at the closed-door meet­ing were not re­leased by press time. He was the only leader who did not use the vir­tual back­ground pro­vided by host Malaysia dur­ing the on­line meet.</p>
    <p>It was the sec­ond time that Mr Trump, who is con­test­ing his elec­tion loss to Demo­crat Joe Bi­den, at­tended an Apec meet. He was at its 2017 sum­mit in Danang, Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>Apec gath­er­ings have in re­cent years been over­shad­owed by USChina trade ten­sions, with lead­ers un­able to agree on a joint dec­la­ra­tion at their 2018 sum­mit in Pa­pua New Guinea. Last year’s meet­ing in Chile was can­celled fol­low­ing mas­sive street protests.</p>
    <p>This year, how­ever, pro­duced both a lead­ers’ dec­la­ra­tion and a post-2020 vi­sion to re­place the Bo­gor Goals which will reach ma­tu­rity this year. The goals, adopted at Apec’s 1994 meet­ing in Bo­gor, In­done­sia, called for its economies to achieve a free and open trade and in­vest­ment en­vi­ron­ment by 2020.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the lead­ers out­lined a vi­sion for the next 20 years of an open, dy­namic, re­silient and peace­ful re­gion an­chored on three eco­nomic driv­ers: trade and in­vest­ment; in­no­va­tion and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion; and strong, bal­anced, se­cure, sus­tain­able and in­clu­sive growth.</p>
    <p>In his speech to fel­low lead­ers, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong urged Apec economies to deepen co­op­er­a­tion on vac­cine de­vel­op­ment and de­ploy­ment, re­sume the move­ment of goods and peo­ple, and back in­clu­sive de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“Apec mem­bers should work to­gether to de­velop and pro­mote ac­cess to di­ag­nos­tic tests, treat­ments and vac­cines,” he said. Sin­ga­pore co-chairs the Friends of the Covid-19 Vac­cine Global Ac­cess Fa­cil­ity group­ing that aims to sup­port vac­cine mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism and ac­cel­er­ate vac­cine de­vel­op­ment, and PM Lee called on Apec economies to join in the ef­fort.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers can also up­date dig­i­tal trade rules to ease cross-bor­der freight and work to­gether to safely re­open bor­ders for travel, he said.</p>
    <p>In­clu­sive de­vel­op­ment is also cru­cial, he said, not­ing that Apec mem­bers are co­op­er­at­ing on hu­man re­source de­vel­op­ment to equip their peo­ple for the fu­ture econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Ex­press­ing sup­port for a refreshed vi­sion for Apec, PM Lee said: “A shared in­ter­est in one an­other’s pros­per­ity and suc­cess will bring about a more in­te­grated, in­ter­de­pen­dent, pros­per­ous and ul­ti­mately safer world.”</p>
    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • A vir­tual sum­mit of Asia-Pa­cific lead­ers started yes­ter­day with US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and his Chi­nese coun­ter­part Xi Jin­ping in at­ten­dance to dis­cuss the coro­n­avirus cri­sis and global eco­nomic re­cov­ery, amid lin­ger­ing trade dif­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>The pair joined a meet­ing of the lead­ers of the 21-na­tion Asia-Pa­cific Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion (Apec) group­ing hosted vir­tu­ally by Malaysia, just two weeks af­ter Mr Trump lost his re-elec­tion bid.</p>
    <p>Apec mem­bers ac­count for about 60 per cent of global gross do­mes­tic prod­uct.</p>
    <p>Asia-Pa­cific lead­ers have called for more open and mul­ti­lat­eral trade to sup­port eco­nomic re­cov­ery and warned against pro­tec­tion­ist trade poli­cies, with Pres­i­dent Xi say­ing that uni­lat­er­al­ism has added to global eco­nomic risks.</p>
    <p>At the last Apec sum­mit in 2018, mem­ber coun­tries failed to agree on a joint com­mu­nique for the first time in the bloc’s his­tory as the United States and China dis­agreed on trade and in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has im­posed tar­iffs on bil­lions of dol­lars worth of Chi­nese prod­ucts, which launched a trade war be­tween the world’s two largest economies.</p>
    <p>In open­ing re­marks at the lead­ers’ meet­ing, Malaysia’s Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin, the chair of Apec 2020, said the bloc’s top pri­or­ity should be to reaf­firm its sup­port and com­mit­ment for a rules­based mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“This is es­sen­tial for our busi­nesses as mar­ket sta­bil­ity and pre­dictabil­ity are the cen­tral pil­lars which en­sure that trade and in­vest­ment con­tinue to flow, even dur­ing times of cri­sis,” said Tan Sri Muhyid­din.</p>
    <p>Other lead­ers who joined the vir­tual meet­ing in­cluded Sin­ga­pore’s Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong, Ja­pan’s Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga, Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin, Cana­dian Prime Min­is­ter Justin Trudeau and New Zealand</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern.</p>
    <p>In the run-up to yes­ter­day’s meet­ing, sev­eral Apec lead­ers warned against pro­tec­tion­ism as the world grap­ples with the eco­nomic im­pact of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“As we con­front this gen­er­a­tion’s big­gest eco­nomic chal­lenge, we must not re­peat the mis­takes of his­tory by re­treat­ing into pro­tec­tion­ism,” Ms Ardern said yes­ter­day, speak­ing at the Apec CEO Dia­logues.</p>
    <p>“Apec must con­tinue to com­mit to keep­ing mar­kets open and trade flow­ing.”</p>
    <p>Other Asia-Pa­cific lead­ers have also ex­pressed hope that the in­com­ing US ad­min­is­tra­tion of Mr Joe Bi­den will en­gage more and sup­port mul­ti­lat­eral trade.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump pulled the US out of the orig­i­nal 12-mem­ber Tran­sPa­cific Part­ner­ship trade pact in early 2017.</p>
    <p>The US is also ab­sent from the world’s largest free trade bloc, the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship – a 15-na­tion pact which in­cludes China that was signed on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has been crit­i­cised for a lower level of en­gage­ment in Asia. The only time he has joined an Apec sum­mit – held an­nu­ally – was in 2017.</p>
    <p>Last year’s sum­mit in Chile was can­celled due to vi­o­lent protests.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump also missed two vir­tual Asia meet­ings last week: The 10-mem­ber Asean sum­mit and the broader East Asia Sum­mit.</p>
    <p>Other than work­ing on a joint com­mu­nique, the Apec lead­ers are ex­pected to dis­cuss the bloc’s post-2020 vi­sion, which would re­place the 1994 Bo­gor Goals – a set of tar­gets on re­duc­ing bar­ri­ers to trade and in­vest­ment – that ex­pires this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi gave a key­note ad­dress to the fo­rum on Thurs­day, hail­ing China as a pivot point for global com­merce and vow­ing to keep its su­per­sized econ­omy open.</p>
