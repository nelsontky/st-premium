    <p>The bulk of the items that Ms Parti Liyani was ac­cused of steal­ing al­legedly be­longed to Mr Karl Liew.</p>
    <p>These in­cluded over 100 pieces of cloth­ing, two wal­lets, bed linen, kitchen uten­sils, a dam­aged lux­ury watch and two iPhone 4 phones.</p>
    <p>At the end of the trial, the dis­trict judge re­moved the wal­lets – a Gucci and a Braun Buf­fel – and some women’s cloth­ing from the charge as there was doubt over whether they were his.</p>
    <p>Mr Liew also claimed a dam­aged Ger­ald Genta watch was worth $25,000 but the trial judge re­duced this to $10,000 based on the orig­i­nal guide price.</p>
    <p>As for the clothes, Ms Parti said some were bought by her while the rest had been given to her. She de­nied pack­ing Mr Liew’s clothes into the boxes and ar­gued some­one else must have put them in.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn said there was a “se­ri­ous risk of con­tam­i­na­tion” of the clothes she was ac­cused of steal­ing with Mr Liew’s cloth­ing that was in a black bag.</p>
    <p>Mr Liew had given a bag of his used clothes to his pre­vi­ous do­mes­tic worker, who had in turn given it to Ms Parti. It was undis­puted that the bag was re­turned to him af­ter Ms Parti was fired.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan said the video taken when three boxes were opened by the fam­ily showed the bag “al­most col­lapsed and emp­tied out”.</p>
    <p>The clothes from the bag had been “taken out and sprawled all around the place” and would have been mixed with the clothes that were taken out of the boxes.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of the way in which the ev­i­dence was han­dled, there was no way of ascer­tain­ing which cloth­ing al­leged to be stolen by Ms Parti was ac­tu­ally from the boxes.</p>
    <p>She was also ac­cused of steal­ing bed linen in­clud­ing a bed­sheet.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan be­lieved her tes­ti­mony that she bought the bed­sheet from Ikea as there was a match­ing quilt cover la­belled “Ikea”. The judge found that Mr Liew had fab­ri­cated his tes­ti­mony about hav­ing pur­chased the bed­sheet from Habi­tat in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti was also ac­cused of steal­ing as­sorted kitchen­ware.</p>
    <p>This in­cluded a stain­less steel pot that Mr Liew and his wife said they used when­ever they went to buy prata from Ca­sua­r­ina Curry in or­der to “get more curry”.</p>
    <p>But Ms Parti said she bought the kitchen­ware and gave de­tails such as the prices and ori­gins.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan said: “Karl’s tes­ti­mony at trial was in­ter­nally in­con­sis­tent and in­suf­fi­cient ev­i­dence has been pro­vided to demon­strate that the uten­sils and kitchen­ware were pur­chased by Karl in the man­ner he had de­scribed.”</p>
