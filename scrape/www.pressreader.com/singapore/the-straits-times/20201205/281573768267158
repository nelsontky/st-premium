    <p>There were three new coro­n­avirus cases re­ported yes­ter­day, all of which were im­ported, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said last night.</p>
    <p>This takes Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,242.</p>
    <p>The cases com­prise one Sin­ga­porean, one per­ma­nent res­i­dent (PR) and one short-term visit pass holder. All three had ar­rived here from In­dia.</p>
    <p>The short-term visit pass holder is a nine-year-old boy who is in Sin­ga­pore to seek med­i­cal treat­ment for an ex­ist­ing con­di­tion which is un­re­lated to Covid-19, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>MOH said that he was con­veyed to the hospi­tal by am­bu­lance on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore and iso­lated.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean is a 57-yearold man who suf­fered on­set of symp­toms on Wed­nes­day, while the PR is a 58-year-old man who was asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>They were both placed on stay-home no­tices on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore and tested dur­ing their SHN.</p>
    <p>There were no lo­cally trans­mit­ted cases yes­ter­day, said MOH.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, said the min­istry, with a to­tal of four cases in the past week which are cur­rently un­linked.</p>
    <p>With seven cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,137 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 28 pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 33 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 29 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
