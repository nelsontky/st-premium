    <p>SAKHIR • Just days af­ter Ro­main Gros­jean’s fire­ball crash and mirac­u­lous es­cape at the Bahrain Grand Prix, the For­mula One cir­cus re­turns to the same venue be­sieged by break­ing news but set to de­liver the fastest laps of the year.</p>
    <p>This week­end’s Sakhir Grand Prix may be raced at the same Bahrain In­ter­na­tional Cir­cuit, but it will run on a dif­fer­ent track – the high-speed outer loop – on which lap times are fore­cast to be around 55 sec­onds in qual­i­fy­ing and be­low 60 in the race.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a fast-mov­ing few days that has seen Gros­jean un­der­stand­ably ruled out by his Haas team as he heals and rests and joint-record seven-time cham­pion Lewis Hamil­ton placed in iso­la­tion af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19, F1 of­fers an in­trigu­ing spec­ta­cle here.</p>
    <p>There will be much in­ter­est in how Haas re­serve Pi­etro Fit­ti­paldi, 24, fares on his de­but in the French­man’s place and per­haps more in study­ing Ge­orge Rus­sell’s progress in Hamil­ton’s Mercedes af­ter step­ping up from strug­glers Wil­liams.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s Rus­sell has two sea­sons’ worth of ex­pe­ri­ence but has yet to score a point.</p>
    <p>How­ever, his op­por­tu­nity to run along­side Valt­teri Bot­tas in the Sil­ver Ar­rows is ex­pected to end that bar­ren se­quence and he hopes to impress team boss Toto Wolff.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, no­body can re­place Lewis, but I’ll give my all for the team in his ab­sence from the mo­ment I step in the car,” said Rus­sell, 22.</p>
    <p>Bot­tas will be seek­ing his first win in six races, while aim­ing for pole along the way.</p>
    <p>Only one driver, Niki Lauda at the 1974 French Grand Prix, has pre­vi­ously recorded a sub-60sec pole po­si­tion lap and his 58.79sec time came on the outer track at Di­jon, which had fewer cor­ners than its al­ter­na­tive lay­out.</p>
    <p>The Finn will hope to emulate that feat on a cir­cuit dubbed “an al­most oval track” by F1’s mo­tor­sports chief Ross Brawn.</p>
    <p>While the in­ner track at Bahrain has 15 cor­ners, the outer loop has only 11 and is al­most 1km shorter, mak­ing it a novel chal­lenge. It has never been used pre­vi­ously for an in­ter­na­tional race week­end and, to add drama, both qual­i­fy­ing and the 87-lap race will take place at night un­der lights.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tional in­trigue will come from Mick Schu­macher, who Haas ear­lier this week con­firmed would join the team next term with Nikita Mazepin and is bid­ding to seal the For­mula Two ti­tle.</p>
    <p>He is also poised to make an early F1 ap­pear­ance in prac­tice at next week’s Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, and, if Gros­jean fails in his bid to re­cover for a per­sonal F1 fi­nale at the Yas Ma­rina cir­cuit, in the fi­nal race of the season.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, it would be a chal­lenge, but def­i­nitely, I would be able to get to know the car more to be even bet­ter pre­pared for next year,” said Schu­macher, the son of seven-time cham­pion Michael.</p>
