    <p>When Malaysian Chan Chee Hao walked across the Cause­way to Sin­ga­pore on the first day of the bor­der reopening in Au­gust, he did not ex­pect that he would join hun­dreds of other work­ers seek­ing cheap rooms to rent.</p>
    <p>Two months later, Mr Chan, 36, still has not found a room near his work­place in Sungei Kadut that meets his bud­get of $600 a month.</p>
    <p>“The rent kept ris­ing for ev­ery unit that I saw. I found out that it would cost be­tween $600 and $850 per per­son to share an air­con­di­tioned room,” said Mr Chan, an air-con­di­tioner in­staller.</p>
    <p>“Most of the land­lords also wanted a min­i­mum of one-year lease when I am look­ing to rent just for six months.”</p>
    <p>He en­tered Sin­ga­pore on Aug 17 un­der the Pe­ri­odic Com­mut­ing Ar­range­ment scheme, which re­quires him to stay here for at least 90 days be­fore he can re­turn on home leave.</p>
    <p>“I al­ready started call­ing the prop­erty agents from Malaysia, but all of them told me they didn’t have any­thing avail­able for me,” said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>He then asked his brother’s land­lord if he could share his brother’s room un­til he found a place.</p>
    <p>The land­lord said “yes”, but the HDB rent in Sin Ming rose from $500 to $900, Mr Chan told The Straits Times. His com­mute was also 90 min­utes each way.</p>
    <p>Two weeks later, he moved in with his sis­ter in her Sengkang flat.</p>
    <p>“I am hop­ing for the bor­der to re­open fully, so I can re­turn to com­mut­ing daily by bike,” said Mr Chan, who is sin­gle.</p>
