    <p>Most key re­gional share mar­kets ral­lied yes­ter­day on the back of op­ti­mism that a new United States stim­u­lus pack­age would be passed be­fore the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial election.</p>
    <p>Spec­u­la­tion that President Don­ald Trump could be pre­pared to agree a deal ex­ceed­ing US$1 tril­lion (S$1.36 tril­lion) lifted in­vestors’ mood, while ex­pec­ta­tions of fur­ther gains on Wall Street fur­ther ig­nited buy­ing in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times In­dex (STI) was among the win­ners as it kicked off the week by ris­ing 10.55 points or 0.42 per cent to 2,543.57 points.</p>
    <p>Gain­ers beat losers 220 to 198 with 1.59 bil­lion shares worth $945.6 mil­lion traded.</p>
    <p>Ground han­dler and in­flight caterer Sats was one of the STI’s bet­ter per­form­ers, de­liv­er­ing a 0.99 per cent gain to $3.06.</p>
    <p>The firm has ac­cel­er­ated plans to di­ver­sify its rev­enue streams out of avi­a­tion and its do­mes­tic mar­ket of Singapore amid the im­pact of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>STI debu­tant Kep­pel DC Reit had a flat­tish per­for­mance at $3.04 at the clos­ing bell.</p>
    <p>Thai Bev­er­age was the most ac­tive STI con­stituent with a trad­ing vol­ume of 40.38 mil­lion shares, but it closed un­changed at 58 cents.</p>
    <p>Re­gional mar­kets were gen­er­ally in an up­beat mood. Tokyo’s bench­mark Nikkei 225 gained 1.11 per cent on bar­gain hunt­ing while Malaysia shares rose 0.95 per cent.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s ASX 200 in­dex gained 0.85 per cent to reach its high­est level since March 6, and the Aussie dol­lar headed north as well.</p>
    <p>The gains come as Vic­to­ria, Aus­tralia’s se­cond-most pop­u­lous state, is al­lowed more free­dom of move­ment as the gov­ern­ment eyes the re­open­ing of restau­rants and re­tail stores by Nov 1.</p>
    <p>“In terms of eco­nomic re­cov­ery, the first step is ob­vi­ously (to) get the econ­omy mov­ing again and that in­volves scal­ing back (Covid-19) re­stric­tions,” said Com­mSec mar­ket an­a­lyst James Tao.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian in­dex has risen 7.6 per cent over the past 11 ses­sions.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s Kospi was up 0.22 per cent. DS In­vest­ment & Se­cu­ri­ties an­a­lyst Na Jeong-hwan noted that while the mar­ket was buoyed by hopes of a US fis­cal pack­age, the weaker-than-ex­pected Chi­nese eco­nomic growth data capped gains.</p>
    <p>That data – China’s third-quar­ter eco­nomic num­bers missed ex­pec­ta­tions, hav­ing risen only by 4.9 per cent – left Shang­hai’s key in­dex as one of the rare few that ended in the red yes­ter­day.</p>
