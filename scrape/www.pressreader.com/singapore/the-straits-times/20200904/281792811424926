    <p>PUTRAJAYA Malaysia will from next week stop the cit­i­zens of more coun­tries from en­ter­ing the coun­try, in­clud­ing those from the US and Bri­tain, Se­nior Min­is­ter Is­mail Sabri Yaakob said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment will im­pose the en­try bans from next Mon­day on those coun­tries that have recorded more than 150,000 Covid-19 cases, he said, as Malaysia tries to shield it­self from coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>He said among the coun­tries on the list were the United States, Brazil, France, Spain, Italy, Saudi Ara­bia, Rus­sia and Bangladesh, Ber­nama news agency re­ported.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment on Tues­day an­nounced en­try bans on cit­i­zens from In­done­sia, In­dia and the Philip­pines from next Mon­day, in­clud­ing those with long-term res­i­dent passes.</p>
    <p>“We will add more coun­tries deemed high-risk, which have more than 150,000 pos­i­tive cases, into the list. Their cit­i­zens will be barred (from en­ter­ing),” Datuk Seri Is­mail Sabri said.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, for emer­gency cases or in­volv­ing bi­lat­eral re­la­tions, such as if a per­son needs to come for a meet­ing be­tween coun­tries, we will al­low en­try. But it re­quires per­mis­sion from the Im­mi­gra­tion</p>
    <p>Depart­ment,” he told re­porters af­ter chair­ing a meet­ing on Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter clar­i­fied that the govern­ment will con­tinue to al­low Malaysians in high-risk coun­tries to re­turn home, but they will have to un­dergo a 14-day quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Mr Is­mail Sabri on Tues­day said long-term pass hold­ers from In­dia, In­done­sia and the Philip­pines will not be al­lowed to en­ter Malaysia from next Mon­day, fol­low­ing a spike in Covid-19 cases in these coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Cit­i­zens from the three coun­tries who will be af­fected in­clude those hold­ing per­ma­nent res­i­dent sta­tus, par­tic­i­pants of the Malaysia My Sec­ond Home pro­gramme, ex­pa­tri­ates and pro­fes­sional visit pass hold­ers.</p>
    <p>The ban would also in­clude spouses of Malaysian cit­i­zens and stu­dents from the three na­tions.</p>
