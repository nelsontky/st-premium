    <p>Lewis Hamil­ton has called for more women in mo­tor rac­ing af­ter the all-fe­male W Se­ries an­nounced on Thurs­day it will be sup­port­ing For­mula One at eight grands prix next sea­son.</p>
    <p>There are no fe­male driv­ers in F1, with Ital­ian Lella Lom­bardi the last to com­pete in a race in 1976, and women rac­ers are a rar­ity in the ju­nior se­ries that feed into the top cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton said the part­ner­ship with W Se­ries, which uses For­mula Three cars and aims to help women up the mo­tor sports lad­der, was a pos­i­tive step.</p>
    <p>“When peo­ple talk about di­ver­sity, peo­ple of­ten think that we’re talk­ing about hav­ing more peo­ple of colour,” said Hamil­ton, F1’s only black driver, ahead of this week­end’s Turk­ish Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>“It’s not just that. It is hav­ing more women in­volved. At the mo­ment it is a male-dom­i­nated sport and that does need to change.”</p>
    <p>No de­tails were given about which grands prix the W se­ries would race at, although founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive Cather­ine Bond Muir told re­porters F1’s sea­son-opener in Aus­tralia in March was prob­a­bly too early.</p>
    <p>This year’s can­celled W Se­ries cham­pi­onship would have sup­ported grands prix in Mex­ico and the United States in Oc­to­ber and that could again be a pos­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>The se­ries started last year but can­celled rac­ing this year due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“When we promised that W Se­ries would be big­ger and bet­ter in the fu­ture, part­ner­ing with For­mula One was al­ways our ul­ti­mate ob­jec­tive,” said Bond Muir.</p>
    <p>“There is no doubt that, now that W Se­ries will be run along­side and in col­lab­o­ra­tion with For­mula One, our global reach, im­pact and in­flu­ence will be in­creased sig­nif­i­cantly.”</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s Jamie Chad­wick was the in­au­gu­ral cham­pion of the se­ries, which fea­tured six rounds sup­port­ing the Ger­man Tour­ing Car Cham­pi­onship and paid out US$500,000 (S$674,000) to the win­ner.</p>
    <p>Top driv­ers in the se­ries will be el­i­gi­ble for points to­wards an FIA su­per li­cence needed to race in F1.</p>
    <p>F1’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for mo­tor sports Ross Brawn said W Se­ries had been “a bea­con to many” since the cham­pi­onship started.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve it is in­cred­i­bly im­por­tant to give ev­ery­one the chance to reach the high­est lev­els of our sport,” he added.</p>
    <p>“Their part­ner­ship with For­mula One next sea­son shows our de­ter­mi­na­tion and com­mit­ment to show­case their ex­cit­ing se­ries and the im­por­tance of build­ing greater di­ver­sity across the sport.”</p>
