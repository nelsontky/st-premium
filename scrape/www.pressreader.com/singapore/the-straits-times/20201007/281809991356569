    <p>BISHKEK • Op­po­si­tion groups in Kyr­gyzs­tan yes­ter­day said they had seized power in the strate­gi­cally im­por­tant Cen­tral Asian coun­try af­ter tak­ing con­trol of gov­ern­ment build­ings in the cap­i­tal amid protests over a par­lia­men­tary elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Sooron­bai Jeen­bekov said the coun­try, which hosts a Rus­sian air base and a Cana­dian-con­trolled gold mine, was fac­ing an at­tempted coup. But he or­dered se­cu­rity forces not to shoot pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>One per­son was killed and 590 wounded in un­rest overnight, the gov­ern­ment said.</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion said it had freed for­mer pres­i­dent Al­mazbek Atam­bayev, who had been jailed on cor­rup­tion charges, and was al­ready dis­cussing the line-up of a pro­vi­sional gov­ern­ment. It was un­clear what role, if any, Mr Atam­bayev would get.</p>
    <p>Mr Jeen­bekov showed no im­me­di­ate signs of re­lin­quish­ing power, al­though the cen­tral elec­tion com­mis­sion was re­ported to have an­nulled the re­sults of Sun­day’s elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal news web­site 24.kg said the com­mis­sion took the de­ci­sion at a meet­ing held af­ter the storm­ing of the gov­ern­ment head­quar­ters.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral op­po­si­tion politi­cians urged the out­go­ing Par­lia­ment to in­stall a pro­vi­sional Cabi­net in or­der to le­git­imise a trans­fer of power.</p>
    <p>Kyr­gyzs­tan bor­ders China and is a close ally of Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>It has long been a plat­form for geopo­lit­i­cal com­pe­ti­tion be­tween Moscow, Washington and Bei­jing. It also has a his­tory of po­lit­i­cal volatil­ity – two of its pres­i­dents have been top­pled by re­volts in the past 15 years.</p>
    <p>The Rus­sian em­bassy in Kyr­gyzs­tan said in a state­ment it sup­ported re­solv­ing the mat­ter through le­gal means while en­sur­ing the peo­ple’s safety and do­mes­tic sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Burnt cars lit­tered Bishkek, the cap­i­tal, yes­ter­day morn­ing af­ter pro­test­ers took con­trol of the main gov­ern­ment build­ing, known as the White House, which briefly caught fire be­fore emer­gency ser­vices put out the blaze.</p>
    <p>De­bris from in­side, in­clud­ing gov­ern­ment pa­pers, and of­fice fur­ni­ture were strewn out­side af­ter pro­test­ers ran­sacked parts of it.</p>
    <p>In­te­rior Min­is­ter Kashkar Junushaliy­ev did not show up for work yes­ter­day, a min­istry spokesman said, adding that Mr Kur­san Asanov, an op­po­si­tion politi­cian and a for­mer senior se­cu­rity of­fi­cial, had taken over as act­ing in­te­rior min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Po­lice had been or­dered to en­sure cit­i­zens’ safety and pre­vent clashes and loot­ing.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s sec­ond-largest gold de­posit, Jeruy, was shut down by uniden­ti­fied peo­ple yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Trou­ble erupted on Mon­day af­ter po­lice used tear­gas and wa­ter can­non to dis­perse thou­sands of peo­ple demon­strat­ing against the re­sults of Sun­day’s elec­tion, which they de­manded be an­nulled.</p>
    <p>Western ob­servers said the elec</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Sooron­bai Jeen­bekov (above) or­dered se­cu­rity forces not to open fire on pro­test­ers (left), seen in Bishkek on Mon­day amid an outcry over the re­sults of the pre­vi­ous day’s par­lia­men­tary elec­tion. tion, which ap­peared to have handed most seats to two es­tab­lish­ment par­ties sup­port­ing closer links be­tween the for­mer Soviet re­pub­lic and Rus­sia, had been marred by vote buy­ing. One of the par­ties was close to Mr Jeen­bekov.</p>
    <p>Po­lice had bro­ken up one protest late on Mon­day, but pro­test­ers later re­turned to Bishkek’s cen­tral square and broke into the White House, home to both the pres­i­dent and Par­lia­ment, news web­sites Akipress and 24.kg re­ported.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers then broke into the head­quar­ters of the State Com­mit­tee for Na­tional Se­cu­rity and freed Mr Atam­bayev, who was sen­tenced to a lengthy prison term this year on cor­rup­tion charges af­ter fall­ing out with Mr Jeen­bekov. Op­po­si­tion groups took over sev­eral more build­ings, in­clud­ing the mayor’s of­fice.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral pro­vin­cial gover­nors have re­signed, ac­cord­ing to me­dia re­ports which said ral­lies had be­gun yes­ter­day in sev­eral pro­vin­cial cen­tres, most of them anti-gov­ern­ment.</p>
