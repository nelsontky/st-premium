    <p>What con­sti­tutes a face mask in the time of Covid-19?</p>
    <p>This ques­tion was raised af­ter a re­cent in­ci­dent where a bus driver re­fused to al­low a man wear­ing a neck gaiter to board be­cause the driver felt it was not a mask.</p>
    <p>Un­der Sin­ga­pore reg­u­la­tions, a mask refers to “any pa­per or tex­tile cov­er­ing de­signed or made to be worn over the nose and mouth to pro­vide the wearer pro­tec­tion against in­fec­tions or air pol­lu­tion, but ex­cludes a face shield”.</p>
    <p>But a study by Duke Uni­ver­sity in the United States, pub­lished in the Science Ad­vances jour­nal this month, found that there are “masks” that ac­tu­ally in­crease the spread of droplets, rather than re­duce it.</p>
    <p>While most peo­ple would abide by the spirit of the law and wear proper masks, a mi­nor­ity in all so­ci­eties will try to flout the law.</p>
    <p>The rule here, that every­one must wear a mask when they are out, un­less they are ex­er­cis­ing, eat­ing or drink­ing, is open to in­ter­pre­ta­tion on what this mask should be.</p>
    <p>A silk scarf cov­er­ing the nose and mouth would of­fer some pro­tec­tion, but would it give enough? Would the wear­ing of masks, as Covid-19 fa­tigue sets in, be­come more of a fash­ion state­ment rather than a health re­quire­ment for some?</p>
    <p>Mask wear­ing is com­pul­sory – with a $300 penalty for not do­ing so – be­cause there are peo­ple with Covid-19 who do not fall sick, show no symp­toms, and yet can in­fect oth­ers. If every­one were to wear a mask when out, it would re­duce the spread of droplets from such asymp­to­matic car­ri­ers, and cut the risk of the virus spread­ing to oth­ers un­know­ingly.</p>
    <p>But not all masks are cre­ated equal. Some of­fer greater bar­ri­ers against the spread of the virus than oth­ers, al­though none is 100 per cent ef­fec­tive. The rule of thumb is: The eas­ier it is to breathe with the mask on, the less ef­fec­tive it is. So peo­ple need to find a com­pro­mise be­tween ef­fec­tive­ness and com­fort.</p>
    <p>The Duke study, which com­pared the spread of droplets from a range of masks, found that most of them gave fairly good pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the re­sults of the study also found that one of the 15 types tested proved to be worse than not wear­ing a mask at all.</p>
    <p>This was a sin­gle-layer neck gaiter made of 92 per cent polyester and 8 per cent span­dex.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing this ap­par­ent anom­aly, the re­searchers said the neck gaiter “seemed to dis­perse the largest droplets into a mul­ti­tude of</p>
    <p>Some masks of­fer greater bar­ri­ers against the spread of the virus than oth­ers, al­though none is 100 per cent ef­fec­tive. The rule of thumb is: The eas­ier it is to breathe with the mask on, the less ef­fec­tive it is. So peo­ple need to find a com­pro­mise be­tween ef­fec­tive­ness and com­fort.</p>
    <p>smaller droplets which ex­plains the ap­par­ent in­crease in droplet count rel­a­tive to no mask in that case”.</p>
    <p>“Con­sid­er­ing that smaller par­ti­cles are air­borne longer than large droplets (larger droplets sink faster), the use of such a mask might be counter-pro­duc­tive.”</p>
    <p>The au­thors added that of the masks they tested, “some mask types ap­proach the per­for­mance of stan­dard sur­gi­cal masks, while some mask al­ter­na­tives, such as neck fleece (gaiters) or ban­danas, of­fer very lit­tle pro­tec­tion”.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Eric West­man, one of the re­searchers in­volved, said in a we­bi­nar on the re­sults that the find­ings also showed “peo­ple do spit out par­ti­cles when they speak”, and not just when they cough, sneeze or shout.</p>
    <p>An­other kind of mask that is bet­ter not worn in pub­lic spa­ces, and in fact has been banned in some places, is one with valves or vents.</p>
    <p>Such a mask, which makes breath­ing eas­ier, does pro­tect the wearer. But it al­lows air, in­clud­ing any droplets in it, to freely flow out – and so, does not stop the trans­mis­sion of the virus from an in­fected per­son.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, the US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion said: “Masks with ex­ha­la­tion valves or vents should not be worn to help pre­vent the per­son wear­ing the mask from spread­ing Covid-19 to oth­ers.”</p>
    <p>Th­ese masks have since been banned by most ma­jor air­lines in the US, as well as some cities there, such as San Fran­cisco and Den­ver.</p>
    <p>Closer to home, health au­thor­i­ties in the Philip­pines have “strongly” ad­vised against the use of masks with valves or vents.</p>
    <p>But cur­rently in Sin­ga­pore, any face cov­er­ing will pass muster, re­gard­less of whether it re­duces or in­creases the spread of droplets.</p>
