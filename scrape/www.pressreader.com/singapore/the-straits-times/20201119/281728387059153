    <p>BANGKOK • Thai­land will ex­tend a na­tion­wide state of emer­gency through Jan 15 to pre­vent a resur­gence in coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions dur­ing the peak New Year travel pe­riod.</p>
    <p>A meet­ing of the Covid-19 task force chaired by Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha ap­proved the ex­ten­sion to help the au­thor­i­ties en­force manda­tory quar­an­tines and stream­line dis­ease-con­trol plans, Mr Taweesilp Wit­sanuy­otin, a spokesman for the panel, told re­porters in Bangkok yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The ex­ten­sion, which is ex­pected to be ap­proved by the Cabi­net next week, would be the eighth since the ini­tial or­der in March.</p>
    <p>The South-east Asian na­tion has been grad­u­ally re­lax­ing some of its virus mea­sures over the past sev­eral months to al­low busi­nesses to fully re­open and some vis­i­tors to re­turn.</p>
    <p>While Thai­land has been largely free of com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion of the deadly virus, its econ­omy has been bat­tered by the hit from the pan­demic to its ex­ports and tourism sec­tors, its two key growth driv­ers.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 panel dis­cussed re­lax­ing a manda­tory 14-day quar­an­tine for vis­i­tors from se­lect lowrisk coun­tries, but a de­ci­sion was de­ferred fol­low­ing con­cerns raised by some of­fi­cials, Mr Taweesilp said. The pro­posal in­cluded al­low­ing vis­i­tors to leave quar­an­tine cen­tres after 10 days and travel to some re­stricted ar­eas, he said.</p>
    <p>Thai­land re­mains closed to most tourists though it has un­veiled a long-stay visa pro­gramme to re­vive tourism, which gen­er­ated about US$60 bil­lion (S$80.5 bil­lion) in rev­enue last year.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 panel ap­proved use of golf re­sorts as quar­an­tine cen­tres, Tourism Min­is­ter Phiphat Ratchak­it­prakarn said.</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s Chu­la­longkorn Univer­sity will be­gin hu­man tri­als of its Covid-19 vac­cine from next year, Mr Taweesilp said.</p>
    <p>The Cabi­net on Tues­day ap­proved a bud­get of 6.05 bil­lion baht (S$268 mil­lion) to se­cure 26 mil­lion doses of vac­cine from As­traZeneca once they be­come avail­able.</p>
    <p>Num­ber of ex­ten­sions to the ini­tial na­tion­wide state of emer­gency or­der since March.</p>
