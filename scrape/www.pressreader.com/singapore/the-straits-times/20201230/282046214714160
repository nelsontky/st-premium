    <p>To mark its 50th an­niver­sary this com­ing Sun­day, Jurong Bird Park will lower its ad­mis­sion prices and fea­ture pi­o­neer birds in spe­cial shows.</p>
    <p>Through­out next month, tick­ets will be priced at $2.50 for all lo­cal res­i­dents – the ad­mis­sion price when the park opened in 1971.</p>
    <p>Tick­ets usu­ally cost $32 for adults, $21 for chil­dren be­tween three and 12 years old, and $15 for se­niors aged 60 and above. Wildlife Re­serves Sin­ga­pore (WRS), which man­ages the park, said pre-book­ing of tick­ets is manda­tory to fa­cil­i­tate crowd man­age­ment and safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Next month, vis­i­tors can also look for­ward to a spe­cial edi­tion of the High Fly­ers Show which will fea­ture Big John, a sul­phur-crested cock­a­too over 50 years old. The show is a spec­ta­cle of free-fly­ing birds swoop­ing over the au­di­ence as the pre­sen­ter shares fun facts about them.</p>
    <p>Big John was al­ready a full-grown adult on the park’s open­ing day. Birds of the species have a life­span of 20 to 40 years in the wild. Big John will not be mak­ing any flights in the show due to his age. He will be brought out on a perch as pre­sen­ters share his life story and quirks.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors can also get a glimpse of how the park has evolved over the years, as well as its his­toric mo­ments and fu­ture de­vel­op­ments.</p>
    <p>Pho­tos to be dis­played around the park in­clude scenes from the park’s early days, as well as from the visit of Bri­tain’s Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Ed­in­burgh to the Water­fall Aviary in 1972.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors can also sym­bol­i­cally foster a flamingo next year by con­tribut­ing $50. Con­trib­u­tors will re­ceive an e-cer­tifi­cate and a voucher for a flamingo key ring.</p>
    <p>WRS said the con­tri­bu­tions will go towards “the care of an­i­mals, re­search and education pro­grammes across (its) parks and sup­port con­ser­va­tion projects to pro­tect threat­ened species in Sin­ga­pore and the re­gion”.</p>
    <p>All this will be part of a se­ries of cel­e­bra­tory events next year, in­clud­ing the launch of the park’s first dig­i­tal trail in March.</p>
