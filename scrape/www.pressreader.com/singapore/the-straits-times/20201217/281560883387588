    <p>The Cy­ber Se­cu­rity Agency of Sin­ga­pore (CSA) has ad­vised com­pa­nies to take steps to se­cure their sys­tems, de­spite the lack of ev­i­dence to sug­gest Sin­ga­pore was a tar­get of a re­cent high-pro­file hack­ing at­tack. It told ST that based on its un­der­stand­ing, the scope of the at­tack was lim­ited and did not af­fect Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>BREACH LIM­ITED TO U.S. OF­FICES</p>
    <p>The Cy­ber Se­cu­rity Agency of Sin­ga­pore (CSA) has ad­vised com­pa­nies to take steps to se­cure their sys­tems, even though there is no in­di­ca­tion that Sin­ga­pore was a tar­get of a re­cent high-pro­file hack­ing at­tack.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the at­tack in­volv­ing cy­ber-se­cu­rity firm FireEye and soft­ware provider So­larWinds Corp, the CSA sent out an ad­vi­sory on Dec 9 for firms to dis­con­nect af­fected cy­ber-se­cu­rity tools and up­date their sys­tems to pro­tect against cy­ber crim­i­nals.</p>
    <p>It told The Straits Times late on Tues­day that based on its un­der­stand­ing, the scope of the FireEye at­tack was lim­ited and did not af­fect Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>FireEye, one of the largest cy­ber­se­cu­rity com­pa­nies in the United States, said ear­lier this month that it was hacked in a state-spon­sored at­tack. The firm’s hack­ing tools, used to test the de­fences of its clients, were stolen in the process.</p>
    <p>The theft stems from ma­li­cious code in­jected by hack­ers into USbased So­larWinds’ soft­ware that FireEye used, the cy­ber-se­cu­rity firm said this week af­ter con­duct­ing an investigat­ion. The soft­ware fa­cil­i­tates the mon­i­tor­ing of com­puter net­works of busi­nesses and gov­ern­ments for out­ages.</p>
    <p>The mal­ware, in the form of a soft­ware up­date, re­port­edly al­lowed hack­ers to spy on se­cure in­for­ma­tion at some of the top agen­cies in the US.</p>
    <p>The at­tack on FireEye, which holds a range of con­tracts in the US and its al­lies, is among the most sig­nif­i­cant breaches in re­cent mem­ory. The firm, which last month re­ported an all-time record rev­enue of US$238 mil­lion (S$316 mil­lion) for the third quar­ter of this year, pro­vides ser­vices for in­ter­na­tional gov­ern­ment agen­cies.</p>
    <p>It also works with big-name firms like telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions com­pany Voda­fone, the Bank of Thai­land and light­ing com­pany Sig­nify, which was pre­vi­ously known as Philips Light­ing.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is a strate­gic part­ner of CSA, which over­sees na­tional cy­ber-se­cu­rity func­tions and pro­tects Sin­ga­pore’s crit­i­cal ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Said the CSA: “Based on the in­for­ma­tion from FireEye, the at­tack was highly tar­geted, with the breach lim­ited to FireEye’s US of­fices. There has been no ev­i­dence to sug­gest that Sin­ga­pore was or would be a tar­get,” it said.</p>
    <p>The agency sent an ad­vi­sory to crit­i­cal in­for­ma­tion in­fra­struc­ture lead­ers, ad­vis­ing them to work with their se­cu­rity ven­dors and up­date their sys­tems to pro­tect them from the stolen FireEye tools.</p>
    <p>TAINTED SOFT­WARE UP­DATE</p>
    <p>Hack­ers had gained ac­cess through So­larWinds’ soft­ware called Orion, us­ing mal­ware that was dis­guised as a soft­ware up­date.</p>
    <p>So­larWinds pro­vides net­work­mon­i­tor­ing and other tech­ni­cal ser­vices to thou­sands of or­gan­i­sa­tions around the world, in­clud­ing most For­tune 500 firms and gov­ern­ment agen­cies in North Amer­ica, Europe, Asia and the Mid­dle East. The firm has an of­fice in Sun­tec City.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to re­ports, more than 18,000 pri­vate and gov­ern­ment users had down­loaded this tainted soft­ware up­date, which re­port­edly al­lowed hack­ers to mon­i­tor in­ter­nal e-mails at some of the top agen­cies in the US.</p>
    <p>In a pub­lic ad­vi­sory on its web­site on Mon­day, the Sin­ga­pore Com­puter Emer­gency Re­sponse Team (SingCert) ad­vised or­gan­i­sa­tions to dis­con­nect or power down So­larWinds’ Orion prod­ucts from their net­works im­me­di­ately. SingCert is a unit of CSA.</p>
    <p>“Ad­min­is­tra­tors should also re­view the logs for sus­pi­cious ac­tiv­i­ties, check con­nected sys­tems for signs of com­pro­mise and per­sis­tence mech­a­nisms, and re­set cre­den­tials if nec­es­sary, es­pe­cially ones used by or stored in So­larWinds soft­ware,” said CSA.</p>
    <p>“Ad­min­is­tra­tors are also ad­vised to mon­i­tor their net­works and sys­tems for any sus­pi­cious ac­tiv­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>CSA said it has been in close con­tact with the US Cy­ber­se­cu­rity and In­fra­struc­ture Se­cu­rity Agency, as well as FireEye. They have both pro­vided CSA with more in­for­ma­tion, which the agency said has helped it to bet­ter is­sue ad­vice on what preven­tive mea­sures to take.</p>
    <p>Based on the in­for­ma­tion from FireEye, the at­tack was highly tar­geted, with the breach lim­ited to FireEye’s US of­fices. There has been no ev­i­dence to sug­gest that Sin­ga­pore was or would be a tar­get.</p>
    <p>CY­BER SE­CU­RITY AGENCY OF SIN­GA­PORE, which also said that based on its un­der­stand­ing, the scope of the FireEye at­tack was lim­ited and did not af­fect Sin­ga­pore.</p>
