    <p>Q What has been your big­gest in­vest­ing mis­take?</p>
    <p>A My most ex­pen­sive mis­take was a 60 per cent drop in eq­uity value be­cause I ig­nored con­ven­tional trade analy­ses and re­fused to sell when I should have.</p>
    <p>It was one of the med­i­cal groups, when it was about 14 cents, and it is cur­rently at 5.6 cents.</p>
    <p>I have learnt to ad­mit when I am wrong about an in­vest­ment, ex­er­cise proper risk man­age­ment and exit with a strict sto­ploss per­cent­age.</p>
    <p>There is al­ways another time to en­ter at a more favourable and cheaper stage, or there are other op­por­tu­ni­ties in the market to in­vest in. I would rather be cheaply wrong and ex­pen­sively right in my in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>Q And your best in­vest­ment?</p>
    <p>A I have in­vested in Shopify and Tesla. This was when Covid-19 hit and I had a list of equities which I was al­ready pre­pared to in­vest in.</p>
    <p>Both coun­ters had a high dou­ble-digit per­cent­age re­turn on in­vest­ment within a rel­a­tively short time as I bought them dur­ing the ini­tial Covid-19 market cor­rec­tions.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the most prof­itable in­vest­ment and one which I am most proud of is my busi­ness Sure­clean.</p>
    <p>Start­ing with $25,000, it has evolved into a mul­ti­mil­lion-dol­lar busi­ness which sup­ports nu­mer­ous staff fam­i­lies and com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
