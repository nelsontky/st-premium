    <p>The tomb­stones in the area des­ig­nated for Covid-19 vic­tims in Delhi’s big­gest Mus­lim grave­yard – the Ja­did Qabris­tan Ahle Is­lam – tell a story of per­ma­nent ex­ile. Many of the bod­ies here are of pa­tients from states such as Bi­har and Ut­tar Pradesh, in­di­vid­u­als who came to Delhi for treat­ment but could not re­turn to be buried closer to home.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties in the city still do not per­mit bod­ies of Covid-19 vic­tims to be taken back to their home­towns be­cause of san­i­tary pro­to­cols, forc­ing fam­i­lies to bury them in Delhi’s grave­yards.</p>
    <p>This bur­den of in­ter­ring the dead from smaller towns and ru­ral parts of the coun­try is one of the con­tribut­ing fac­tors to a prob­lem for grave­yards in big In­dian ci­ties as they try to keep pace with the coun­try’s grow­ing Covid-19 death toll.</p>
    <p>In­dia, which cur­rently has the third-high­est num­ber of deaths due to the pan­demic, has recorded more than 126,000 fa­tal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The Delhi ceme­tery carved out nearly one more hectare last month to bury Covid-19 vic­tims after it ran out of pre­vi­ously al­lo­cated space. This was its third such al­lo­ca­tion since April. A to­tal of around 2.4ha has been ear­marked so far and the grave­yard now has space for an­other 500 bod­ies.</p>
    <p>While the num­ber of daily na­tion­wide deaths has fallen to around 500 cur­rently – down from more than a thou­sand in Septem­ber – fears of a fresh spike prompted by the on­go­ing fes­tive sea­son con­tinue to worry grave­yard man­age­ment com­mit­tees.</p>
    <p>If the pan­demic gath­ers pace again, there is a dan­ger of run­ning out of space, Mr Mo­hammed Shamim, su­per­vi­sor of the grave­yard set up in 1924, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>At least two smaller Mus­lim grave­yards in Delhi also ran out of space ear­lier this year, fol­low­ing which the au­thor­i­ties ac­quired more land.</p>
    <p>An­other Mus­lim grave­yard in Ko­pri in Navi Mum­bai stopped ac­cept­ing bod­ies of Covid-19 vic­tims in Septem­ber for the same rea­son. Fam­i­lies who come to bury their dead are be­ing asked to ap­proach other grave­yards. It is a prob­lem that has also been re­ported by Chris­tian ceme­ter­ies i n Ban­ga­lore.</p>
    <p>Rapid devel­op­ment in and around In­dian ci­ties shrank the space for the dead even be­fore the pan­demic. But the Covid-19 cri­sis has ex­ac­er­bated the prob­lem with its ad­di­tional chal­lenges, such as op­po­si­tion from fear­ful lo­cals, who have pre­vented bod­ies from be­ing buried i n neigh­bour­ing grave­yards.</p>
    <p>Govern­ment rules also man­date deeper and wider graves for vic­tims of Covid-19, ne­ces­si­tat­ing more space. Such graves are more than 3m deep com­pared with around 1.2m for oth­ers. They are also wider and re­quire ad­di­tional space in be­tween.</p>
    <p>An­other key con­cern is that, un­like non-Covid-19 graves, which are reused, there is no cer­tainty of when graves of Covid-19 vic­tims can be dug up to bury other bod­ies. “A body de­com­poses i n around t wo years, fol­low­ing which we re­use the grave, but the govern­ment has told us not to touch a Covid grave for at least five years to avoid any spread of in­fec­tion,” said Mr Mo­hammed Si­raj, the trea­surer of Noor-ul Is­lam Trust, which man­ages the grave­yard in Ko­pri.</p>
    <p>The grave­yard, which is spread over 2,500 sq m, stopped tak­ing Covid-19 vic­tims after bury­ing its 46th vic­tim in Septem­ber. Set up 35 years ago, it has al­ready be­gun reusing its 250 non-Covid-19 graves. “We have writ­ten to the govern­ment ask­ing for ad­di­tional land but are yet to hear back from the au­thor­i­ties,” he added.</p>
    <p>In Ban­ga­lore, Chris­tian fam­i­lies with Covid-19 vic­tims were also turned away from some grave­yards in Septem­ber, when the pan­demic was peak­ing in the city. Mr J.A. Kan­thraj, the spokesman for the Arch­dio­cese of Ban­ga­lore, told The Straits Times that at least six Catholic grave­yards faced a space crunch and that some fam­i­lies had to cre­mate their dead.</p>
    <p>The pro­to­col for graves of Covid-19 vic­tims was re­cently re­laxed in Ban­ga­lore, eas­ing some of the pres­sure on city grave­yards, but Mr Kan­thraj said they were still press­ing for more burial land, to mit­i­gate the “se­ri­ous cri­sis”.</p>
    <p>The Bruhat Ben­galuru Ma­hana­gara Pa­like, the lo­cal municipal cor­po­ra­tion, has iden­ti­fied space for about 10 burial grounds on the out­skirts of the city but has yet to hand over the land.</p>
