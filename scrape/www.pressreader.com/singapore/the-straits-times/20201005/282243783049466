    <p>French horse Sottsass won the Prix de l’Arc de Tri­om­phe yes­ter­day as two-time win­ner En­able’s bid to be­come the first horse to win the tre­ble ended in dis­ap­point­ment.</p>
    <p>Sottsass – third last year – gave trainer Jean-Claude Rouget his first vic­tory in the 2,400m race al­though he en­dured a ner­vous wait af­ter a stew­ard’s en­quiry.</p>
    <p>He later said: “Our en­tire aim for 2020 was this and it’s not been easy with the changes to the cal­en­dar.</p>
    <p>“We’ve never been able to do quite what we wanted with the horse. But these last few days I’ve re­ally felt he was in top form.”</p>
    <p>En­able was prom­i­nent on en­ter­ing the fin­ish­ing straight but Frankie Det­tori failed to rouse the 2017 and 2018 win­ner, who fin­ished sixth. “It was too deep (the ground), it killed her ac­tion,” said the Ital­ian jockey.</p>
    <p>Ger­man Derby win­ner In Swoop fin­ished like a train to take sec­ond while long-time l eader Per­sian</p>
    <p>King was third.</p>
    <p>The win­ner’s jockey Cris­tian De­muro and sev­eral of his fel­low jock­eys were called into the stew­ards room to watch the fin­ish and give their ver­sion of events. The last time an Arc win­ner was dis­qual­i­fied was Sa­gace in 1985 hand­ing vic­tory to En­able’s owner Prince Khalid Ab­dul­lah’s Rain­bow Quest.</p>
    <p>There was to be no re­peat this time and con­fir­ma­tion re­sulted in so­cial dis­tanc­ing be­ing dis­re­garded as the trainer and oth­ers hugged in the pad­dock. They were joined in their cel­e­bra­tions by the 1,000 spec­ta­tors per­mit­ted to at­tend un­der coro­n­avirus pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>The race took place af­ter the dra­matic de­ci­sion by Irish trainer Ai­dan O’Brien to with­draw his four run­ners due to their re­turn­ing pos­i­tive drug tests be­lieved to be due to con­tam­i­nated feed.</p>
    <p>Mean­while in the United States, Swiss Sky­diver out­paced Ken­tucky Derby win­ner and race favourite Au­then­tic in a dra­matic photo-fin­ish to win the Preak­ness Stakes in Bal­ti­more on Satur­day, bring­ing an end to a Triple Crown bid.</p>
    <p>With the win, Swiss Sky­diver, rid­den by Robby Al­barado, be­came only the sixth filly to win the 1,900m race at Pim­lico and the first since Rachel Alexan­dra in 2009. Je­sus’ Team was third.</p>
    <p>The race is tra­di­tion­ally held in May as the sec­ond leg of US thor­ough­bred rac­ing’s Triple Crown but was post­poned this year due to the virus.</p>
