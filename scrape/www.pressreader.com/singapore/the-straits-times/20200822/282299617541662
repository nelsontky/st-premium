    <p>NEW YORK • On Tues­day, the S&P 500 stock in­dex hit a record high. The next day, Ap­ple be­came the first United States com­pany in his­tory to be val­ued at more than US$2 tril­lion (S$2.7 tril­lion). US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump is, of course, tout­ing the stock mar­ket as proof that the US econ­omy has re­cov­ered from the coro­n­avirus; too bad about those 173,000 dead Amer­i­cans, but as he says: “It is what it is.”</p>
    <p>But the econ­omy prob­a­bly does not feel so great to the mil­lions of work­ers who still have not got their jobs back and who have just seen their un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits slashed. The US$600-a-week sup­ple­men­tal ben­e­fit en­acted in March has ex­pired, and Mr Trump’s pur­ported re­place­ment is ba­si­cally a sick joke.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore the aid cut-off, the number of par­ents re­port­ing that they were hav­ing trou­ble giv­ing their chil­dren enough to eat was ris­ing rapidly. That number will surely soar in the next few weeks. We are also about to see a huge wave of evic­tions, both be­cause fam­i­lies are no longer get­ting the money they need to pay rent and be­cause a tem­po­rary ban on evic­tions, like sup­ple­men­tal un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits, has just ex­pired.</p>
    <p>But how can there be such a dis­con­nect be­tween ris­ing stocks and grow­ing mis­ery? Wall Street types, who do love their let­ter games, are talk­ing about a “K-shaped re­cov­ery”: ris­ing stock valuations and in­di­vid­ual wealth at the top, fall­ing in­comes and deep­en­ing pain at the bot­tom. But that is a de­scrip­tion, not an ex­pla­na­tion. What is go­ing on?</p>
    <p>The first thing to note is that the real econ­omy, as op­posed to the fi­nan­cial mar­kets, is still in ter­ri­ble shape. The Fed­eral Re­serve Bank of New York’s weekly eco­nomic in­dex sug­gests that the econ­omy, although off its low point a few months ago, is still more deeply de­pressed than it was at any point dur­ing the re­ces­sion that fol­lowed the 2008 fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>And this time around, job losses are con­cen­trated among lower-paid work­ers – that is, pre­cisely those Amer­i­cans with­out the fi­nan­cial re­sources to ride out bad times.</p>
    <p>What about stocks? The truth is that stock prices have never been closely tied to the state of the econ­omy. As an old econ­o­mists’ joke has it, the mar­ket has pre­dicted nine of the last five re­ces­sions.</p>
    <p>Stocks do get hit by fi­nan­cial crises, such as the dis­rup­tions that fol­lowed the fall of Lehman Brothers in Septem­ber 2008 and the brief freeze in credit mar­kets back in March. Other­wise, stock prices are quite dis­con­nected from things like jobs or even gross do­mes­tic prod­uct.</p>
    <p>These days, the dis­con­nect is even greater than usual.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause the re­cent rise in the mar­ket has been largely driven by a small number of tech­nol­ogy gi­ants. And the mar­ket val­ues of these com­pa­nies have very lit­tle to do with their cur­rent prof­its, let alone the state of the econ­omy in gen­eral. In­stead, they are all about in­vestor per­cep­tions of the fairly dis­tant fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Take the ex­am­ple of Ap­ple, with its US$2 tril­lion val­u­a­tion. Ap­ple has a price-earn­ings ra­tio – the ra­tio of its mar­ket val­u­a­tion to its prof­its – of about 33. One way to look at that number is that only around 3 per cent of the value in­vestors place on the com­pany re­flects the money they ex­pect it to make over the course of the next year. As long as they ex­pect Ap­ple to be prof­itable years from now, they barely care what will hap­pen to the US econ­omy over the next few quar­ters.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, the prof­its peo­ple ex­pect Ap­ple to make years from now loom es­pe­cially large be­cause, af­ter all, where else are they go­ing to put their money? Yields on US govern­ment bonds, for ex­am­ple, are well be­low the ex­pected rate of in­fla­tion.</p>
    <p>And Ap­ple’s val­u­a­tion is ac­tu­ally less ex­treme than the valuations of other tech gi­ants, like Ama­zon and Net­flix.</p>
    <p>So big tech stocks – and the peo­ple who own them – are rid­ing high be­cause in­vestors be­lieve that they will do very well in the long run. The de­pressed econ­omy hardly mat­ters.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, or­di­nary Amer­i­cans get very lit­tle of their in­come from cap­i­tal gains, and can­not live on rosy pro­jec­tions about their fu­ture prospects.</p>
    <p>Telling your land­lord not to worry about your cur­rent in­abil­ity to pay rent be­cause you will surely have a great job five years from now will get you nowhere – or, more ac­cu­rately, will get you kicked out of your apart­ment and put on the street.</p>
    <p>So here is the cur­rent state of the US: Un­em­ploy­ment is still ex­tremely high, largely be­cause Mr Trump and his al­lies first re­fused to take the coro­n­avirus se­ri­ously, then pushed for an early re­open­ing in a na­tion that met none of the con­di­tions for re­sum­ing busi­ness as usual – and even now refuse to get firmly be­hind ba­sic pro­tec­tive strate­gies such as wide­spread mask re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>De­spite this epic fail­ure, the un­em­ployed were kept afloat for months by fed­eral aid, which helped avert both hu­man­i­tar­ian and eco­nomic catas­tro­phe. But now the aid has been cut off, with Mr Trump and his al­lies as un­se­ri­ous about the loom­ing eco­nomic dis­as­ter as they were about the loom­ing epi­demi­o­log­i­cal dis­as­ter.</p>
    <p>So ev­ery­thing sug­gests that even if the pan­demic sub­sides – which is by no means guar­an­teed – we are about to see a huge surge in national mis­ery.</p>
    <p>Oh, and stocks are up. Why, ex­actly, should we care?</p>
