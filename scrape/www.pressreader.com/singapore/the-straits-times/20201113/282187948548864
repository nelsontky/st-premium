    <p>Ate­lier Ten, the de­sign firm be­hind the spiky shad­ing sys­tem that gives The Es­planade its durian-like ap­pear­ance, an­nounced yes­ter­day that it will be added to the Sur­bana Jurong Group.</p>
    <p>The Lon­don-head­quar­tered en­vi­ron­men­tal de­sign con­sul­tancy will be Sur­bana Jurong’s ninth mem­ber com­pany, bring­ing along some 30 years of ex­pe­ri­ence in sus­tain­able so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>Sur­bana Jurong said in a state­ment yes­ter­day the move com­pletes its port­fo­lio of ser­vices as it in­creas­ingly fo­cuses on sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Sur­bana Jurong, an ur­ban and in­fra­struc­ture de­sign con­sul­tancy head­quar­tered here, was formed five years ago. Its broad ex­per­tise cov­ers ar­chi­tec­ture, de­sign, en­gi­neer­ing, fa­cil­i­ties man­age­ment and se­cu­rity ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The firm has worked with the Hous­ing Board to build more than a mil­lion homes here and cre­ated mas­ter­plans in more than 30 coun­tries. It has 16,500 em­ploy­ees based in more than 120 of­fices in over 40 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Prior to the ac­qui­si­tion, Sur­bana Jurong and Ate­lier Ten had col­lab­o­rated on a num­ber of projects here over the last decade. These in­clude the in­door forests at Jewel Changi Air­port and the eco­log­i­cally sus­tain­able re­ju­ve­na­tion project in Mandai.</p>
    <p>Ate­lier Ten also worked on the two glass and steel cooled con­ser­va­to­ries at Gar­dens by the Bay, in part­ner­ship with Bri­tish ar­chi­tec­ture firm Wilkin­sonEyre and land­scape ar­chi­tec­ture firm Grant As­so­ci­ates.</p>
    <p>Its other no­table projects in­clude Google’s head­quar­ters in Lon­don and the Royal Na­tional Theatre in Lon­don, where it re­placed the cen­tral heat­ing and cool­ing plant with an ab­sorp­tion cool­ing sys­tem and ground source heat pumps to achieve car­bon sav­ings of 30 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ate­lier Ten found­ing direc­tor Pa­trick Bellew said the union is an op­por­tu­nity to drive to­wards a more sus­tain­able world. “The syn­er­gies and op­por­tu­ni­ties that join­ing this group presents for the team here at Ate­lier Ten, and for our clients and col­lab­o­ra­tors, are enor­mous,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sur­bana Jurong group chief ex­ec­u­tive Wong Heang Fine said the ad­di­tion of Ate­lier Ten to its port­fo­lio will help boost the de­sign­ing of “high-per­for­mance, sus­tain­able build­ings and smart in­fra­struc­ture that con­serve en­ergy and re­sources”.</p>
    <p>“With ev­ery project, we are spurred by the chal­lenge of do­ing more with less. To­gether with Ate­lier Ten, we can un­lock even greater value from our sus­tain­abil­ity so­lu­tions,” he said.</p>
