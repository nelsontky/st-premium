    <p>I read with great con­cern and shock about the col­lege don who had openly dis­cussed the idea of sex­ual re­la­tion­ships be­tween teach­ers and stu­dents (Sacked don dis­cussed teacher-stu­dent sex­ual re­la­tion­ships in pa­per, Oct 21).</p>
    <p>I have great re­spect for the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) as one of the fore­most ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions and top-rank­ing uni­ver­si­ties in the world.</p>
    <p>The pa­per and the book that for­mer col­lege don Jeremy Fer­nando wrote in 2017 ob­vi­ously crossed the line of aca­demic ed­u­ca­tion into im­moral­ity and per­ver­sion.</p>
    <p>It was re­ported that he wrote “in­sem­i­na­tion” can be a part of teach­ing and could open up teach­ers and stu­dents to pos­si­bil­i­ties, and that teach­ing and learn­ing take place in the bod­ies of stu­dents and teach­ers.</p>
    <p>Are we al­low­ing aca­demics to sow im­moral val­ues and per­ver­sion in our young adults whom we en­trust to the univer­sity, in the name of push­ing the bound­aries of ed­u­ca­tion?</p>
    <p>In the cur­rent con­text of ris­ing voyeurism in the cam­pus, is this what we want?</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, does the univer­sity take re­spon­si­bil­ity for the pa­pers pub­lished by its dons?</p>
    <p>Are they aware of the kind of val­ues pushed by the aca­demics they en­gage?</p>
    <p>If these val­ues do not con­form to ac­cepted moral norms, does the univer­sity take ac­tion?</p>
    <p>From the ar­ti­cle, it ap­pears that the stu­dents were quite taken in by his teach­ing and even liked and looked up to him. This would im­ply that his teach­ing may have sub­stan­tial in­flu­ence over his stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Third, his pa­per and book were writ­ten in 2017 – that means three whole years have elapsed where ap­par­ently noth­ing was done. Was the univer­sity aware of the pa­per he wrote?</p>
    <p>I would ap­pre­ci­ate it if NUS could give some an­swers. Ed­u­ca­tion is about pass­ing down the right val­ues. Great knowl­edge with­out val­ues and dis­cern­ment could spell dis­as­ter for an en­tire gen­er­a­tion.</p>
