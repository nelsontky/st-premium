    <p>The next decade will be crit­i­cal for Sin­ga­pore as it ad­justs to dis­rup­tions in a post-Covid-19 world and finds an op­ti­mal role to play in the new nor­mal, said For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>With much at stake in the com­ing years, the coun­try will need a for­eign ser­vice manned by the best Sin­ga­pore­ans avail­able, he added, de­scrib­ing them as “tena­cious, ded­i­cated in­di­vid­u­als with the skills, the com­mit­ment and the con­vic­tion to do what’s best for Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore­ans”.</p>
    <p>Dr Balakr­ish­nan was speak­ing at a vir­tual di­a­logue with six For­eign Ser­vice schol­ar­ship re­cip­i­ents and their par­ents. Two re­ceived the Pub­lic Ser­vice Com­mis­sion Schol­ar­ship (For­eign Ser­vice), while the other four were awarded the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment Schol­ar­ship (For­eign Ser­vice).</p>
    <p>He told these fu­ture and prospec­tive diplo­mats that they are in “a most fas­ci­nat­ing pe­riod in his­tory... liv­ing through a revo­lu­tion”.</p>
    <p>In broad strokes, he sketched out the var­i­ous forces at play in the world or­der, which he said was “reach­ing an in­flec­tion point”.</p>
    <p>Glob­al­i­sa­tion and eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion – “the recipe for peace and</p>
    <p>What is most im­por­tant for all of you is to be in­tel­lec­tu­ally nim­ble, cog­ni­tively deep and yet, flex­i­ble. You need both that sense of ad­ven­ture, that abil­ity to take risks when nec­es­sary, the wis­dom to know... that sim­ply go­ing on, straight-line, busi­ness as usual, is not enough. ’’ FOR­EIGN MIN­IS­TER VI­VIAN BALAKR­ISH­NAN, speak­ing to six For­eign Ser­vice schol­ar­ship re­cip­i­ents dur­ing a vir­tual di­a­logue yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>pros­per­ity and for con­struc­tive co­op­er­a­tion amidst na­tion states” – are now un­der stress.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, pro­tec­tion­ist, na­tion­al­ist and even xeno­pho­bic at­ti­tudes have come to the fore, made worse by the dig­i­tal revo­lu­tion which has cre­ated anx­i­ety and af­fected mid­dle-class wages, as well as jobs across the spec­trum, he noted.</p>
    <p>In the last few months, these trends have been fur­ther ag­gra­vated and ac­cel­er­ated by is­sues such as the ris­ing ten­sions be­tween the United States and China and the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Com­bined, they have plunged the world into the deep­est global re­ces­sion since the Great De­pres­sion of the 1930s, Dr Balakr­ish­nan said.</p>
    <p>But he noted that the up­heavals also pro­duce op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>“The key pur­pose of our for­eign pol­icy is to ad­vance the long-term, en­light­ened in­ter­ests of Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore­ans, and this means, it be­gins at home.”</p>
    <p>On the do­mes­tic front, the econ­omy will need to be re­struc­tured, and Sin­ga­pore­ans’ skills will need to be up­graded. Sin­ga­pore must also strengthen its so­cial com­pact as it deals with the an­tic­i­pated volatil­ity and dis­rup­tion on the eco­nomic front, he said.</p>
    <p>“Ex­ter­nally, it means main­tain­ing our rep­u­ta­tion, trust­wor­thi­ness... (and) some­times, to say no to other states – big or small, pow­er­ful or not so pow­er­ful – and to do so not be­cause we just want to throw a tantrum but be­cause we are up­hold­ing our le­git­i­mate na­tional rights, and we are con­form­ing with in­ter­na­tional law,” he said.</p>
    <p>As fu­ture diplo­mats in the mak­ing, “what is most im­por­tant for all of you is to be in­tel­lec­tu­ally nim­ble, cog­ni­tively deep and yet, flex­i­ble,” he told the schol­ar­ship re­cip­i­ents.</p>
    <p>“You need both that sense of ad­ven­ture, that abil­ity to take risks when nec­es­sary, the wis­dom to know... that sim­ply go­ing on, straight-line, busi­ness as usual, is not enough.”</p>
    <p>BE FLEX­I­BLE AND BOLD</p>
