    <p>Wear­ing spe­cial eye­wear, se­niors had to com­plete tasks such as press­ing the cor­rect but­ton on a vir­tual lift panel and key­ing in the cor­rect sum of money to buy fruit.</p>
    <p>It was part of a new im­mer­sive vir­tual-re­al­ity (VR) study de­signed in Sin­ga­pore to de­tect mild cog­ni­tive im­pair­ment in se­niors.</p>
    <p>If left unchecked, cog­ni­tive im­pair­ment can slowly be­come de­men­tia, caus­ing se­ri­ous changes in a se­nior’s be­hav­iour and af­fect­ing other fam­ily mem­bers and friends.</p>
    <p>The first study in the se­ries, called Re@ch, was de­vel­oped by SingHealth Poly­clin­ics (SHP) and Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School (DukeNUS) in 2018, in col­lab­o­ra­tion with an In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion (ITE) Tech­nol­ogy team from ITE Col­lege West.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 60 se­nior pa­tients aged be­tween 65 and 85 were as­sessed at SHP’s Ou­tram Poly­clinic in the Phase 1 study com­pleted in April last year. Nine in 10 found the test a pos­i­tive ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>SHP’s As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Tan Ngiap Chuan said Phase 1 of the study has shown the fea­si­bil­ity and ac­cept­abil­ity of us­ing VR to screen for cog­ni­tive im­pair­ment in se­niors.</p>
    <p>The vir­tual en­vi­ron­ment of 13 daily sce­nar­ios from the home to the su­per­mar­ket al­lows the re­search team to as­sess the se­niors’ cog­ni­tive skills bet­ter.</p>
    <p>There are at present sev­eral screen­ing tools, the most pop­u­lar be­ing the Mini-Men­tal State Ex­am­i­na­tion (MMSE), which is the most widely ap­plied test for de­men­tia screen­ing, and the Mon­treal Cog­ni­tive Assess­ment (MoCA), which is con­sid­ered the best al­ter­na­tive to the MMSE. Both tests are con­ducted us­ing pa­per and pen­cil and are ad­min­is­tered to pa­tients by healthcare work­ers.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts say one of the chal­lenges in such self-re­port­ing ques­tion­naire-based as­sess­ments is that these may not be ad­e­quate in re­view­ing a per­son’s per­for­mance of ac­tiv­i­ties in daily life, known as “ex­ec­u­tive func­tions” – such as plan­ning, fo­cus­ing and re­mem­ber­ing in­struc­tions.</p>
    <p>Ex­ec­u­tive func­tions are one of</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, one in 10 peo­ple aged 60 years and older may have de­men­tia. The con­di­tion oc­curs when the brain is dam­aged by stroke or dis­eases like Alzheimer’s, caus­ing mem­ory loss and dif­fi­cul­ties with think­ing, prob­lem-solv­ing or lan­guage.</p>
    <p>the six do­mains of cog­ni­tion, with the oth­ers be­ing com­plex at­ten­tion (such as mul­ti­task­ing), mem­ory, lan­guage, per­cep­tual-mo­tor (how the brain and eyes speak to each other) and so­cialcog­ni­tion (such as de­creased in­hi­bi­tions).</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, one in 10 peo­ple aged 60 years and older may have de­men­tia. The con­di­tion oc­curs when the brain is dam­aged by stroke or dis­eases like Alzheimer’s, caus­ing mem­ory loss and dif­fi­cul­ties with think­ing, prob­lem­solv­ing or lan­guage.</p>
    <p>All the en­rolled se­nior pa­tients in the first phase of the VR study were of ac­cept­able men­tal ca­pac­ity and were first screened via the MoCA test.</p>
    <p>Those with MoCA scores of 26 or higher out of 30 were iden­ti­fied as be­ing “cog­ni­tively in­tact”, while the rest who scored less than 26 were clas­si­fied as hav­ing some de­gree of cog­ni­tive im­pair­ment. Out of the 60 pa­tients, close to 40 per cent scored less than 26.</p>
    <p>Both groups then took the VR test to de­ter­mine if there were any dif­fer­ences in their per­for­mance. Each par­tic­i­pant had 15 to 20 min­utes to com­plete the test.</p>
    <p>They were as­sessed on the abil­ity to com­plete at last seven tasks cor­rectly, the num­ber of at­tempts at each task and the pro­por­tion of tasks per­formed cor­rectly.</p>
    <p>In gen­eral, the scores for each VR task per­formed were higher for the cog­ni­tively in­tact in­di­vid­u­als than those with cog­ni­tive im­pair­ment.</p>
    <p>A per­son with sus­pected early cog­ni­tive de­cline will be the tar­get user of the Phase 2 study, which be­gan last month and aims to as­sess close to 200 pa­tients aged 35 years and older.</p>
    <p>Prof Tan said the re­sults will be re­viewed be­fore the sys­tem is im­ple­mented for rou­tine screen­ing.</p>
    <p>“It is still pre­ma­ture to in­di­cate a time­line as more re­search needs to be done to val­i­date the sys­tem be­fore it can be rolled out into clin­i­cal prac­tice,” he says.</p>
    <p>“Ul­ti­mately, the goal is to lever­age emerg­ing tech­nol­ogy to por­tray re­al­is­tic set­tings in the early de­tec­tion of de­men­tia in atrisk in­di­vid­u­als and to pre­pare care­givers to sup­port their loved ones.”</p>
    <p>Two se­niors who took part in the first phase of the VR study said it was a fun ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Re­tired nurse Seah Ai Choo, 70, says ini­tially she was slightly ap­pre­hen­sive about us­ing the VR tool. “How­ever, my wor­ries were un­founded as the ex­pe­ri­ence was fan­tas­tic, although the bulky eye­wear did cause some mild dis­com­fort as it pressed on my nose,” says Madam Seah with a laugh.</p>
    <p>Re­tiree Fran­cis Toh, 76, who used to work in the food and bev­er­age in­dus­try, says: “It was fun and easy to use and I felt I was re­ally per­form­ing the ac­tions in that vir­tual en­vi­ron­ment.”</p>
