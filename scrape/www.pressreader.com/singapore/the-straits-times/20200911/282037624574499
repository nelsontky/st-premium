    <p>A man punched his mother, who fell and frac­tured her thigh bone, af­ter she re­fused to loan him $120.</p>
    <p>Sat­pal Singh Jaswant Singh, 40, was jailed for two years yes­ter­day over one count of as­sault and other of­fences in­clud­ing ha­rass­ment and us­ing crim­i­nal force on a pub­lic ser­vant and crim­i­nal in­tim­i­da­tion.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Singh, a Sin­ga­porean, went home around mid­night on Feb 7 and asked his mother, Madam Ran­jeer Kaur, for $120. The 69-year-old wo­man said she could not af­ford to loan him any more money and en­cour­aged him to look for a job. Singh then be­came an­gry and punched her right thigh once, caus­ing her to fall. He left the scene soon af­ter.</p>
    <p>Madam Kaur called the po­lice when she re­alised she was un­able to stand up by her­self. She was later taken to Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>A Feb 27 med­i­cal re­port said her right thigh bone had frac­tured af­ter she fell when her son punched her.</p>
    <p>On the ha­rass­ment charge, the court was told that Singh met a 34-year-old wo­man in May last year and they had a dis­agree­ment four months later.</p>
    <p>De­tails about the dis­agree­ment were not re­vealed in court doc­u­ments but the wo­man sub­se­quently blocked Singh’s phone num­ber as she wanted to cease all com­mu­ni­ca­tion with him.</p>
    <p>He re­sponded by tor­ment­ing her from Sept 20 to Nov 13 last year, in­clud­ing by re­peat­edly call­ing her al­most daily from pub­lic phones. Singh also con­tacted the wo­man’s hus­band through Face­book Mes­sen­ger, claim­ing that he had been in­ti­mate with her.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate in­ci­dent, the court heard that Singh joined two men for a drink­ing ses­sion at the void deck of Block 140, Po­tong Pasir Av­enue 3 at around 1.30pm on Feb 24, and later quar­relled with one of them over an undis­closed mat­ter.</p>
    <p>He left af­ter telling the man he would “skin him alive” and re­turned to the void deck at around 4am armed with a kitchen knife.</p>
    <p>The man, who ran away af­ter Singh’s threat, called the po­lice and four of­fi­cers ar­rived on the scene shortly there­after.</p>
    <p>Singh, who was ob­served to be drunk, was un­co­op­er­a­tive when an of­fi­cer tried to in­ter­view him. He then hurled vul­gar­i­ties at the po­lice­men and spat at an of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>For as­sault­ing his mother, Singh could have been jailed for up to five years and fined up to $10,000.</p>
    <p>He could have been jailed for up to four years and fined for us­ing crim­i­nal force on a pub­lic ser­vant.</p>
