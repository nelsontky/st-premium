    <p>Charles Chong had a plan. He would assem­ble a team of vet­eran MPs to con­test Alju­nied Group Rep­re­sen­ta­tion Con­stituency (GRC) and win it back for the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) at the 2015 Gen­eral Elec­tion (GE).</p>
    <p>The team would in­clude peo­ple like him­self and fel­low MP In­der­jit Singh.</p>
    <p>“I thought we should go out and make a con­certed ef­fort to try and win it back,” says Mr Chong.</p>
    <p>“We have to get a few of the nonconform­ist sort. These fel­lows voted opposition, so ob­vi­ously they don’t want pro-es­tab­lish­ment peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>He floated the pro­posal to PAP leaders and in the end, he was in­deed sent to an opposition ward – but to Pung­gol East SMC, then held by the Work­ers’ Party’s (WP) Ms Lee Li Lian. Mr Chong wrested it back for the rul­ing party, with 51.77 per cent of the vote.</p>
    <p>Mr Chong says he does not know why the PAP did not ac­cept his plan for Alju­nied GRC: “My per­sonal view is that there must be a healthy opposition. But it is not within the purview of the rul­ing party to nur­ture the opposition, for good­ness sake.”</p>
    <p>If there is one man who could con­ceiv­ably strate­gise and pull off a victory against a star WP slate led by its then sec­re­tary-gen­eral Low Thia Khi­ang, it would be Charles Chong.</p>
    <p>Pung­gol East was only the lat­est – and it turns out, the last – victory in a string of closely fought elec­toral bat­tles that Mr Chong, ar­guably the rul­ing party’s most skilled po­lit­i­cal street fighter, won in his 32 years in pol­i­tics. He re­tired this year.</p>
    <p>With his mix of street-smart savvy and af­fa­ble charm, the 67-year-old has been the long­est serv­ing politi­cian in Sin­ga­pore bar­ring the three prime ministers and Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam.</p>
    <p>‘MORE TROU­BLE­SOME OUT­SIDE THE PAP THAN WITHIN’</p>
    <p>Stay­ing so long was not part of Mr Chong’s plans when he en­tered pol­i­tics at age 35.</p>
    <p>As an air­craft en­gi­neer with Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA), he had ex­cit­ing over­seas post­ings on the hori­zon.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally wasn’t re­ally in­ter­ested in be­ing in pol­i­tics for that long be­cause I had my own ca­reer. But by the time I fin­ished do­ing all this, my ca­reer had sort of passed me by,” says Mr Chong, who had a liver trans­plant in 2016 fol­low­ing a di­ag­no­sis of an in­flam­ma­tory con­di­tion called non-al­co­holic steato­hep­ati­tis.</p>
    <p>His name was put up by former Cab­i­net min­is­ter Lim Boon Heng, who told the party, ac­cord­ing to Mr Chong: “I think Charles would be more trou­ble­some out­side the PAP than within.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim was then as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral of NTUC, while Mr Chong was chair­man of the air­craft engineers branch of the SIA Staff Union (Si­asu).</p>
    <p>Their paths crossed when Mr Chong was plan­ning a se­cret bal­lot for in­dus­trial ac­tion fol­low­ing a re­fusal by the com­pany to ne­go­ti­ate a col­lec­tive agree­ment with the engineers be­fore talk­ing to Si­asu.</p>
    <p>He left union work when he was pro­moted to se­nior man­age­ment in 2000 and was in­el­i­gi­ble for mem­ber­ship but stayed on as an ad­viser.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the PAP re­cruit­ment tea ses­sion in 1987, Mr Chong, a Catholic, told Pro­fes­sor S. Jayaku­mar that the Gov­ern­ment was mak­ing a mis­take with the Marx­ist con­spir­acy ar­rests, which saw 16 peo­ple, in­clud­ing church and so­cial work­ers, de­tained for al­legedly plot­ting to top­ple the gov­ern­ment. He was also one of the few PAP candidates without a de­gree; he got his air­craft en­gi­neer­ing di­ploma in 1976 from Syd­ney Tech­ni­cal Col­lege.</p>
    <p>All that not­with­stand­ing, he was asked to stand for elec­tion in Sem­bawang GRC in 1988.</p>
    <p>In 1991, his sec­ond GE, he was pulled out of Sem­bawang and sent to Eunos GRC, where the PAP team had won just 50.89 per cent of vote in the pre­vi­ous elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Chong de­scribes it as his “most stress­ful con­test”, with the PAP up against a WP team that in­cluded former Barisan Sosialis leader Lee Siew Choh.</p>
    <p>The lead changed be­tween both camps sev­eral times on polling night as the votes were counted.</p>
    <p>“I re­call writ­ing my victory speech when we were lead­ing, then throw­ing it away and writ­ing a de­feat speech. We later caught up and I had to scram­ble to look for the speech I had thrown away.”</p>
    <p>When his third GE rolled around in 1997, Eunos GRC was wiped off the elec­toral map. Mr Chong then stood in Pasir Ris GRC.</p>
    <p>It was a pat­tern that would be re­peated ev­ery GE there­after.</p>
    <p>In 2011, Mr Chong won Joo Chiat with 51.02 per cent against the WP’s Mr Yee Jenn Jong, with a mere 388 votes sep­a­rat­ing them.</p>
    <p>Joo Chiat was later merged with Marine Pa­rade GRC, and in 2015, Mr Chong was sent to Pung­gol East, where he pulled off an­other of his knife-edge wins.</p>
    <p>Then, ahead of his re­tire­ment this year, Pung­gol East be­came part of</p>
    <p>Sengkang GRC. It was won by the WP with 52.13 per cent of the vote, in the big­gest up­set in the 2020 GE.</p>
    <p>On why the PAP lost the GRC, he de­clined com­ment, say­ing that the team led by labour chief Ng Chee Meng had done a de­tailed post­mortem anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>Asked if he felt any blame for the de­feat, Mr Chong said sim­ply that he had helped the can­di­date who suc­ceeded him in Pung­gol East – lawyer Ray­mond Lye – in his cam­paign, and that it was the long­est han­dover he has had; al­most all his res­i­dents were told who his re­place­ment was likely to be.</p>
    <p>“I think Ray­mond as a first-timer did okay, lim­it­ing the swing in Pung­gol East to less than 5 per cent. Un­for­tu­nately that wasn’t enough to win.”</p>
    <p>When Mr Chong him­self plunged into the fray, he had al­ways won, as Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong noted in a trib­ute in June, and “by the skin of his teeth”. “Be­cause when there is a tough fight, and we need a strong can­di­date who will fight hard and fight smart, we send in Charles Chong. And ev­ery time, Charles has de­liv­ered”.</p>
    <p>Mr Chong reck­ons his string of suc­cesses is down to con­vinc­ing vot­ers to trust that he will do his best for them: “So as long as they think that you are gen­uine and you would fight for their in­ter­ests, they will give you a chance.”</p>
    <p>For in­stance, MPs may some­times come across as dis­mis­sive when they lec­ture res­i­dents: “Look, why did you speed? Why did you park there? You know there’s no park­ing there”.</p>
    <p>He adds: “You don’t prom­ise them the im­pos­si­ble when they ask for help, but they want to see you make an ef­fort, em­pathise, that you are a gen­uine per­son.”</p>
    <p>That Mr Chong has been able to con­sis­tently per­suade vot­ers of his sin­cer­ity is es­pe­cially im­pres­sive con­sid­er­ing the short time frame he has to work with when the party drops him into a new con­stituency at the last minute.</p>
    <p>Take Joo Chiat. His can­di­dacy was con­firmed on Nom­i­na­tion Day.</p>
    <p>The party branch was bereft of ac­tivists, forc­ing him to go around the is­land ask­ing for help. “So I went in there with quite a rag­tag army.”</p>
    <p>With a racon­teur’s skill of telling old war sto­ries, he adds: “The only per­son who knew the bound­aries well was the man who put up the cam­paign posters. So I was ask­ing him, ex­plain to me, where is the boundary for Joo Chiat?</p>
    <p>“He told me, for­get it, you see your face on the poster? When you see that it sud­denly changes to Goh Chok Tong, then it is no longer yours.”</p>
    <p>Emer­i­tus Se­nior Min­is­ter Goh was stand­ing in the then-ad­ja­cent Marine Pa­rade GRC.</p>
    <p>NOT A CHENG BOCK OR AN IN­DER­JIT</p>
    <p>Re­tired PAP MPs have taken var­i­ous routes. Some leave qui­etly, re­sum­ing their fam­ily lives and ca­reers; oth­ers, such as Mr Singh and Dr Tan Cheng Bock, re­main vis­i­ble in the pub­lic eye, with the lat­ter start­ing his own po­lit­i­cal party.</p>
    <p>What route will Mr Chong take? “I don’t think I’d like to be like In­der­jit or Cheng Bok. They are both one of a kind,” says Mr Chong, who also re­tired from SIA in 2018.</p>
    <p>“Low Thia Khi­ang said he hopes he would not have to make a come­back. I hope I would not have to write a book.”</p>
    <p>Why not? “Some of the peo­ple that I might write about are still around and may not like what I say about them!”</p>
    <p>He looks forward to be­ing “an or­di­nary se­nior ci­ti­zen” but will con­sider other ar­eas where he can make a con­tri­bu­tion af­ter tak­ing a break.</p>
    <p>One ques­tion that of­ten arises is how much room there is for dis­sent and de­bate within the rul­ing party, es­pe­cially for back­benchers fac­ing down pow­er­ful ministers.</p>
    <p>Enough, says Mr Chong. In fact, that is how in­flu­ence can be brought to bear, be­hind closed doors.</p>
    <p>“You know, I don’t think they ap­pre­ci­ated pub­lic sort of re­bukes. If you try and change from out­side by at­tack­ing dif­fer­ent poli­cies, I no­tice that they al­ways cir­cle the wag­ons and then block you. But if you lobby from within, much change can take place more ef­fec­tively.</p>
    <p>“I will not for once dare to claim that I changed poli­cies. But I would like to think that part of my in­puts helped con­trib­ute to­gether with oth­ers to move things along.”</p>
