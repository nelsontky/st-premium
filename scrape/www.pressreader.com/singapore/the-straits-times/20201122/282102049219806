    <p>In the next 10 years, many new jobs will be cre­ated in the agri­food sec­tor and en­gi­neers will be needed, i nclud­ing peo­ple with ex­per­tise in process con­trol, au­to­ma­tion and ro­bot­ics.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing yes­ter­day at the Na­tional En­gi­neers Day cel­e­bra­tion, Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu said the fu­ture in sus­tain­abil­ity and cli­mate mit­i­ga­tion and adap­ta­tion re­quires en­gi­neer­ing so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>“From build­ing flood pro­tec­tion struc­tures, more ef­fi­cient so­lar PV (pho­to­voltaic) sys­tems, charg­ing in­fra­struc­ture for elec­tric ve­hi­cles, har­ness­ing value from waste to high-yield agri-tech sys­tem, we look to en­gi­neer­ing... for so­lu­tions to our cur­rent and fu­ture chal­lenges.”</p>
    <p>The an­nual event for the young to dis­cover en­gi­neer­ing, held on­line this year, had kicked off on Nov 12. The win­ners of this year’s En­gi­neer­ing In­no­va­tion Chal­lenge were an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>For the com­pe­ti­tion, 101 teams of stu­dents com­peted to find en­gi­neer­ing so­lu­tions for real-world prob­lems.</p>
    <p>Win­ning projects in­cluded a sys­tem to im­prove crop qual­ity, yield and rate of growth in an ur­ban farm­ing set-up, as well as a bac­te­ria-killing ul­tra­vi­o­let light tun­nel for sushi con­veyor belts. All win­ners will get a seed fund to kick-start their projects.</p>
    <p>“Given that we pro­duce less than 10 per cent of our nu­tri­tional needs now, it is even more cru­cial for us to har­ness tech­nol­ogy and cre­ative minds like yours to push the fron­tiers of lo­cal food pro­duc­tion,” Ms Fu said in her vir­tual ad­dress, de­liv­ered from The In­sti­tu­tion of En­gi­neers, Sin­ga­pore (IES) build­ing in Bukit Tinggi Road in Bukit Timah.</p>
    <p>“We are no longer just grow­ing our foods; we are pro­duc­ing our foods with man­u­fac­tur­ing equip­ment and pro­cesses,” she added.</p>
    <p>IES pres­i­dent Richard Kwok said each year, stu­dents leave the Na­tional En­gi­neers Day cel­e­bra­tions with a “new sense of won­der about en­gi­neer­ing”.</p>
    <p>“Their ex­pe­ri­ence very of­ten sparks a seed of pas­sion for en­gi­neer­ing in them, open­ing their eyes and minds to the pos­i­tive dif­fer­ences that they can make in the world by be­com­ing en­gi­neers,” he said.</p>
    <p>At the event, three agree­ments on the use of ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) in en­gi­neer­ing were signed.</p>
    <p>Two will con­trib­ute to the set­ting up of Sin­ga­pore’s first AI En­gi­neer­ing Hub, as well as the es­tab­lish­ment of learn­ing and devel­op­ment pro­grammes for en­gi­neers.</p>
    <p>The last, be­tween AI Sin­ga­pore and SMRT Corp, is a col­lab­o­ra­tion on sev­eral AI projects.</p>
