    <p>Af­ter 14 years of fly­ing with Sin­ga­pore Air­lines as a cabin crew mem­ber, Ms Zabrina Kng de­cided it was time for a ca­reer switch to nurs­ing.</p>
    <p>Her new ca­reer would al­low her to pur­sue her life­long in­ter­est in health­care and to spend more time with her age­ing par­ents.</p>
    <p>She learnt about the Work­force Sin­ga­pore’s Pro­fes­sional Con­ver­sion Pro­gramme for Reg­is­tered Nurses (Diploma) in 2017, and set her sights on ap­ply­ing for the two-year pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>But af­ter find­ing out that she had missed the in­take for the year, she con­tin­ued work­ing as a cabin crew mem­ber for an­other year so that she could save up for the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>By the time her con­tract with SIA ended in 2018, she had saved $12,000, which she used to sup­ple­ment the monthly al­lowance of around $2,000 she re­ceived from the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>But for Ms Kng, 34, it was still an ad­just­ment fi­nan­cially. “Ini­tially when I first started, I re­ally had to ad­just my life­style. I told my­self that since I’ve made this switch to nurs­ing, I needed to per­se­vere.”</p>
    <p>Re­turn­ing to school in her 30s was an­other chal­lenge. “It was an ac­cel­er­ated diploma which would nor­mally take three years to com­plete. So the learn­ing curve was very steep for me.”</p>
    <p>She grad­u­ated from the pro­gramme in April and be­gan work­ing for Wood­lands Health Cam­pus, al­though she is tem­po­rar­ily sta­tioned at Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>She be­lieves her cabin crew ex­pe­ri­ence has been help­ful in her new role, and has taught her skills such as com­mu­ni­ca­tion, em­pa­thy and be­ing able to work well un­der pres­sure.</p>
