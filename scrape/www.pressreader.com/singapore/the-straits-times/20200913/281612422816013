    <p>An in­ter­na­tional con­ven­tion that aims to help busi­nesses re­solve cross-bor­der dis­putes and fur­ther fa­cil­i­tate in­ter­na­tional trade took ef­fect yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Called the Sin­ga­pore Con­ven­tion on Me­di­a­tion, the United Na­tions treaty is the first to be named af­ter the coun­try, said the Min­istry of Law in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The con­ven­tion seeks to pro­vide busi­nesses around the world with more cer­tainty in re­solv­ing cross­bor­der dis­putes through me­di­a­tion by mak­ing it pos­si­ble for them to ap­ply di­rectly to the courts of coun­tries that have rat­i­fied the treaty.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Home Af­fairs and Law K. Shan­mugam, who rep­re­sented Sin­ga­pore as the first coun­try to sign the treaty, said: “The con­ven­tion’s en­try into force is a sig­nif­i­cant mile­stone, as it fur­ther strength­ens the in­ter­na­tional dis­pute res­o­lu­tion en­force­ment frame­work.</p>
    <p>“This ben­e­fits busi­nesses by pro­vid­ing greater cer­tainty in re­solv­ing cross-bor­der com­mer­cial dis­putes, ul­ti­mately fa­cil­i­tat­ing in­ter­na­tional trade and com­merce.”</p>
    <p>As of Sept 1, 53 coun­tries have signed the con­ven­tion, also known as the UN Con­ven­tion on In­ter­na­tional Set­tle­ment Agree­ments Re­sult­ing from Me­di­a­tion, in­clud­ing the United States, China and In­dia. The list also in­cludes Afghanista­n and the Pa­cific is­land na­tion of Palau.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, Ecuador, Fiji, Qatar, Saudi Ara­bia and Be­larus have rat­i­fied the con­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>Through me­di­a­tion, par­ties in a cross-bor­der dis­pute can at­tempt to ne­go­ti­ate a new deal, fa­cil­i­tated by a neu­tral third-party me­di­a­tor, to sal­vage a com­mer­cial re­la­tion­ship that would oth­er­wise dis­in­te­grate if the lit­i­ga­tion or ar­bi­tra­tion routes were taken.</p>
    <p>Presently, a set­tle­ment agree­ment made in one coun­try has no le­gal force in an­other.</p>
    <p>A party seek­ing to en­force a me­di­ated set­tle­ment agree­ment in an­other coun­try or mul­ti­ple coun­tries will have to com­mence le­gal pro­ceed­ings in each coun­try. This can be costly and time-con­sum­ing, es­pe­cially for in­ter­na­tional set­tle­ment agree­ments.</p>
    <p>The treaty also strength­ens Sin­ga­pore’s po­si­tion as an in­ter­na­tional dis­pute res­o­lu­tion cen­tre and bet­ter serves the needs of in­ter­na­tional busi­nesses that use Sin­ga­pore as a base for in­ter­na­tional com­mer­cial trans­ac­tions, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>Sec­re­tary of the UN Com­mis­sion on In­ter­na­tional Trade Law Anna Joubin-Bret said: “We look for­ward to (the con­ven­tion) bring­ing cer­tainty and sta­bil­ity to the in­ter­na­tional frame­work on me­di­a­tion and con­tribut­ing to the sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment goals, in­clud­ing the goal of pro­mot­ing peace­ful and in­clu­sive so­ci­eties for sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment.”</p>
