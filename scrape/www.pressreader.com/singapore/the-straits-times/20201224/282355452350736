    <p>•</p>
    <p>LON­DON Arse­nal’s League Cup exit at the hands of Manch­ester City on Tues­day has left the Premier League club in dire straits ahead of a sea­son-defin­ing festive sched­ule, man­ager Mikel Arteta ad­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>The Gun­ners have lost five of their last seven Premier League games and lie in 15th place with 14 points, their worst start to a sea­son since 1974-75.</p>
    <p>Their prob­lems mounted af­ter a 4-1 League Cup de­feat by hold­ers City sent them crash­ing out of the com­pe­ti­tion, crank­ing up the pres­sure on Arteta, who took charge of the club last De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Arse­nal face Chelsea in the Premier League on Satur­day be­fore games against rel­e­ga­tion battlers Brighton and West Bromwich Al­bion in quick suc­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Poor re­sults in all three games could see Arteta’s men fall into the bot­tom three at the end of the festive sched­ule for the first time in Premier League his­tory and it is a prospect that has left the Spa­niard wor­ried.</p>
    <p>“We have to turn it around, there is no ques­tion,” he told Sky Sports. “If we don’t, we are in big trou­ble, so this is the mo­ment that is go­ing to de­cide our sea­son.</p>
    <p>“We do have the tools to turn things around be­cause I see how much the play­ers try and what they are try­ing to do, but at the mo­ment, a lot of strange things are hap­pen­ing in ev­ery game and that makes things re­ally dif­fi­cult.”</p>
    <p>The sack ru­mours are con­tin­u­ing to swirl around Arteta but he is hop­ing the board will give him time and funds to re­in­force his be­lea­guered squad in the Jan­uary trans­fer win­dow.</p>
    <p>“We are look­ing at op­tions that we have, play­ers com­ing in and out,” he said. “It’s a re­ally com­pli­cated win­dow with the pan­demic and the way that football is at the mo­ment.”</p>
    <p>The hosts’ prob­lems were laid bare at the Emi­rates as hap­less de­fend­ing and a wretched dis­play by re­serve goal­keeper Ru­nar Alex Ru­nars­son saw them prac­ti­cally gift four goals to City, who net­ted via Gabriel Je­sus, Riyad Mahrez, Phil Fo­den and Aymeric La­porte.</p>
    <p>The re­turn­ing Gabriel Martinelli, mak­ing his first start and sec­ond ap­pear­ance since March be­cause of in­jury, was the only bright spark, with the Brazil­ian for­ward cre­at­ing Alexan­dre La­cazette’s lev­eller, but he had to be sub­sti­tuted af­ter sus­tain­ing an in­jury.</p>
    <p>City boss Pep Guardi­ola could only sym­pa­thise with his for­mer as­sis­tant’s plight, say­ing: “What can I say – in our po­si­tion as a man­ager we’ll be judged by the re­sults.</p>
    <p>“I can only say I was with him a long pe­riod (31/ years), the most</p>
    <p>2 suc­cess­ful pe­riod our club had.</p>
    <p>“Some­times, in our job we need time. It’s time to be pa­tient. He’s an out­stand­ing man­ager, in­cred­i­ble work ethic and puts the club in front of any de­ci­sions he has to make.”</p>
