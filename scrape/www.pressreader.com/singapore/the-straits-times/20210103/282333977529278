    <p>Re­mem­ber these words: cor­ni­cione, Ooni and Moretti. You will be hear­ing them a lot this year.</p>
    <p>Cor­ni­cione is Ital­ian for the puffy rim of a Neapoli­tan pizza, the crunchy-on-the-out­side, chewy-on­the-in­side strip of heaven you want to leave on the plate but can­not. Why does any­one need pizza top­pings when they can have cor­ni­cione?</p>
    <p>Ooni and Moretti are brands of pizza ovens. Ooni forni are meant for home use, hulk­ing Moret­tis for pro-es­tab­lish­ments. Al­though if you have a big gar­den, or a huge shed...</p>
    <p>You must surely have known that carbs would come roar­ing back, right? And they did with a vengeance, aided by the Covid-19 pan­demic. All around the world, peo­ple want – no, need – com­fort.</p>
    <p>No­body finds com­fort in steamed chicken breast. But pizza? Sour­dough bread? Crepes? Galettes? Yes please.</p>
    <p>And so ar­ti­sanal pizza joints are pop­ping up all over Sin­ga­pore – Chooby Pizza in Owen Road; 4am Pizza, soon to open on Sen­tosa; Piz­za­kaya in VivoCity; and Lucali BYGB in Kam­pong Bugis.</p>
    <p>Small’s, chef Bjorn Shen’s tiny four-seat pizza closet in Mid­dle Road, has moved to big­ger premises in Laven­der Street.</p>
    <p>Yet more are com­ing up. At least two places, one helmed by the chef be­hind a wildly suc­cess­ful pri­vate din­ing busi­ness, the other by a cou­ple who run sev­eral restau­rants, are set to open this year.</p>
    <p>Just as pizza places keep pop­ping up, restau­rants sell­ing pancakes are mush­room­ing like fungi af­ter rain. French Fold in Telok Ayer and Gather at the Raf­fles Ho­tel ar­cade, both of which serve crepes and galettes, are al­ways full. Flip­per’s Pancakes from Ja­pan, which serves bouncy souffle pancakes, has also opened at Ngee Ann City to queues.</p>
    <p>And let’s not for­get our daily bread.</p>
    <p>The cir­cuit breaker pe­riod un­leashed a slew of sour­dough bread mak­ers who, af­ter ply­ing fam­ily and friends with loaves, de­cided to sell them to carb­seek­ing peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Strictly Sour­dough, Heart­land Sour­dough, Small Town Sour­dough, Mary­mount Bake­house, Seran­goon Sour­dough, Sour­dough Roti and Sin­ga­pore Sour­dough are just some of the brands that are com­ing in hot.</p>
    <p>It is still very early in the year, and there is time for other carbs to shine.</p>
    <p>I would like to see two of them take cen­tre stage. Ar­ti­sanal hand­made pasta that cus­tomers can buy on­line and cook at home would be very wel­come. So would cafes or take­away kiosks sell­ing in­ven­tive sando – Ja­panese-style sand­wiches made with soft shoku­pan.</p>
    <p>Pasta and sand­wiches are just what the world needs now.</p>
