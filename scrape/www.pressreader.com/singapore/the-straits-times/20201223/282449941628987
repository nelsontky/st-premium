    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES Lu­cra­tive TV deals and over­whelm­ing pop­u­lar­ity will be crit­i­cal to the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) as it nav­i­gates a new sea­son with few fans able to at­tend games – and spend their money in­side are­nas.</p>
    <p>Most teams are not rul­ing out the pos­si­bil­ity of wel­com­ing fans at some point this sea­son and a hand­ful, in­clud­ing the Or­lando Magic, At­lanta Hawks, Mem­phis Griz­zlies and Utah Jazz are al­low­ing a lim­ited num­ber from the start.</p>
    <p>But the loss of ticket sales and inarena rev­enue will hurt as Covid-19 rav­ages the United States, the world’s worst-hit coun­try.</p>
    <p>“You could be look­ing at losses of over US$3 bil­lion (S$4 bil­lion) across the league based on ticket rev­enue, con­ces­sions, cor­po­rate boxes and so on should the pan­demic im­pact the whole of the 2020-21 sea­son as a worst-case sce­nario,” Con­rad Wi­acek, head of sport anal­y­sis at Glob­alData, told Reuters.</p>
    <p>“NBA teams are guar­an­teed a loss with only 72 games com­pared to a stan­dard 82-game sea­son.”</p>
    <p>Glob­alData re­search also sug­gested the league and teams lost more than US$694 mil­lion from the 258 can­celled games last sea­son, af­ter the pan­demic forced a four-month hia­tus in March.</p>
    <p>With TV rights deals in place, how­ever, in­clud­ing a re­ported US$1.4 bil­lion yearly con­tract with Dis­ney, the NBA has plenty of cush­ion and this month agreed to dis­trib­ute US$30 mil­lion to teams to boost liq­uid­ity, Sports Busi­ness Daily re­ported.</p>
    <p>An­drew Zim­bal­ist, a pro­fes­sor at Smith Col­lege who has con­sulted for play­ers, teams and leagues, said the NBA’s tremen­dous prof­itabil­ity gave it a strong fi­nan­cial stand­ing, even though it is too soon to say how much Covid-19 will re­strict arena and gate rev­enue.</p>
    <p>“There might be an owner or two in the NBA that’s feel­ing pinched, not so much be­cause of the NBA but be­cause of other as­sets,” he said. “Are all the teams hurt­ing rel­a­tive to what they’re used to? Yeah, of course, as is just about ev­ery­body in the United States.”</p>
    <p>Even the Dal­las Mav­er­icks’ gre­gar­i­ous bil­lion­aire owner Mark Cuban, who has taken on na­tion­wide fame as a shrewd in­vestor nav­i­gat­ing would-be en­trepreneur­s on re­al­ity TV pro­gramme Shark Tank, con­ceded this is one deal he can­not get the best of.</p>
    <p>“Am I go­ing to lose a lot of money this year? Yes. No ques­tion about it. More than US$100 mil­lion when this is all said and done? Yes,” he said. “We need to get back into our nor­mal sea­son.”</p>
    <p>That said, the chal­lenges of re­duced at­ten­dance do not present an “ex­is­ten­tial cri­sis” for the league, ac­cord­ing to Vic­tor Mathe­son, an ex­pert in sports eco­nomics and a pro­fes­sor at Col­lege of the Holy Cross in Mas­sachusetts.</p>
    <p>“The NBA is go­ing to be able to pass about half of those rev­enue losses on to the play­ers be­cause the col­lec­tive bar­gain­ing agree­ment specif­i­cally says that the salary cap is set as a func­tion of rev­enues,” he told Reuters.</p>
    <p>While some own­ers, in­clud­ing Cuban and Joe Tsai of the Brook­lyn Nets, have com­mit­ted to pay­ing arena work­ers through the end of the year, Mathe­son said rank-and­file staffers at empty are­nas are likely hurt­ing the most.</p>
    <p>“Those ush­ers, those con­ces­sion work­ers, those park­ing at­ten­dants, the front-of­fice staff that have been cut… they’re out of luck and they’re not sit­ting on a US$7 mil­lion salary that gets cut by a lit­tle bit,” he added. “Nor are they a multi-bil­lion­aire.”</p>
    <p>Am I go­ing to lose a lot of money this year? Yes. No ques­tion about it. More than US$100 mil­lion when this is all said and done? Yes.</p>
    <p>’’ MARK CUBAN, Dal­las Mav­er­icks owner, pre­dict­ing how much his team would lose this sea­son due to Covid-19.</p>
