    <p>WELLINGTON • Air New Zealand re­ported its first full-year loss in 18 years and said it is un­likely to re­turn to profit soon as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic crip­ples in­ter­na­tional travel.</p>
    <p>The car­rier posted a net loss af­ter tax of NZ$454 mil­lion (S$411 mil­lion) for the year ended June 30, down from a NZ$276 mil­lion profit a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>While un­able to pro­vide spe­cific earn­ings guid­ance, the air­line said cur­rent mod­el­ling sug­gests that it will make an­other “sig­nif­i­cant” loss next year.</p>
    <p>The Auck­land-based air­line, which usu­ally gen­er­ates twothirds of its rev­enue from in­ter­na­tional travel, does not expect pas­sen­ger demand to re­turn to last year’s lev­els un­til 2023 or be­yond.</p>
    <p>“Un­til global bor­ders reopen, we will con­tinue to be sig­nif­i­cantly im­pacted by this cri­sis,” chief ex­ec­u­tive Greg Fo­ran said. “The un­for­tu­nate re­al­ity is that we don’t expect to see a re­turn to long-haul travel for some time, and un­til then we will be a keenly fo­cused do­mes­tic air­line.”</p>
    <p>Air­lines around the world are reel­ing from the im­pact of the pan­demic on global travel, forc­ing them to re­view fleets, routes and spend­ing and turn to gov­ern­ments for help.</p>
    <p>Air New Zealand has laid off about 4,000 staff and grounded some air­craft, while do­mes­tic ser­vices have been ham­pered by a sec­ond lock­down in Auck­land af­ter a new out­break there.</p>
    <p>“Some air­lines will not sur­vive this,” Mr Fo­ran said.</p>
    <p>“The ac­tions we have taken to date, al­beit painful, are with a view to set­ting our­selves up for suc­cess in what­ever com­pet­i­tive and demand en­vi­ron­ment emerges on the other side of this cri­sis.”</p>
    <p>Air New Zealand shares were steady at NZ$1.415 at 11.10am in Wellington. It has slumped 52 per cent this year and was as low as 80 NZ cents in late March.</p>
    <p>On a con­fer­ence call with an­a­lysts, Mr Fo­ran de­scribed the op­er­at­ing en­vi­ron­ment as the worst the avi­a­tion in­dus­try has ever ex­pe­ri­enced and said the road to recovery looked long. “We ab­so­lutely aren’t see­ing a Vshaped recovery or even a U; it’s more like an L,” he said.</p>
    <p>Op­er­at­ing rev­enue sank 16 per cent to NZ$4.84 bil­lion as to­tal net­work ca­pac­ity de­clined 21 per cent from a year ear­lier. Cargo rev­enue was a bright spot, ris­ing 15 per cent to NZ$449 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Air New Zealand said it ex­pects to start draw­ing on a NZ$900 mil­lion loan fa­cil­ity pro­vided by the gov­ern­ment in com­ing days.</p>

    <p>DO­MES­TIC FO­CUS</p>
    <p>Un­til global bor­ders reopen, we will con­tinue to be sig­nif­i­cantly im­pacted by this cri­sis... The un­for­tu­nate re­al­ity is that we don’t expect to see a re­turn to long-haul travel for some time, and un­til then we will be a keenly fo­cused do­mes­tic ’’ air­line.</p>
