    <p>SEOUL • Fresh from scor­ing South Korea’s first No. 1 hit on the United States Bill­board chart, K-pop jug­ger­nauts BTS are set­ting their sights on a stand­alone per­for­mance at next year’s Grammy Awards – and maybe a tro­phy or two.</p>
    <p>Since their de­but in 2013, the seven-mem­ber South Korean boy band have surfed the global K-pop craze to dizzy­ing heights.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, they landed at the top spot on the Bill­board Hot 100 chart with breezy disco hit Dy­na­mite, their first sin­gle en­tirely in English, which has been lapped up by main­stream pop fans in the US.</p>
    <p>For BTS, the global smash hit – the mu­sic video for which has racked up more than 285 mil­lion views on YouTube – raises hopes of glory at the Gram­mys.</p>
    <p>The band per­formed at t he awards in Jan­uary this year along­side Amer­i­can rap­per Lil Nas X, but have never been nom­i­nated.</p>
    <p>At an on­line news con­fer­ence on Wed­nes­day, band leader and rap­per RM, 25, said: “The Gram­mys is the place that all artists would dream of, and we’re hop­ing that we will be able to stage our own per­for­mance, se­cure nom­i­na­tions and if pos­si­ble, win an award.”</p>
    <p>The group said the Bill­board achieve­ment still did not “feel real”, lament­ing be­ing un­able to cel­e­brate it with fans. They have can­celled a world tour due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“All the per­for­mances and con­certs we had al­ways held have now be­come a dream,” said RM, whose real name is Kim Nam-joon.</p>
    <p>“But we still want to do an out­door show some day, invit­ing many peo­ple and throw­ing a fes­ti­val at a big square.”</p>
    <p>BTS boast an ex­ten­sive global fan base, col­lec­tively called Army, who along with the band have been ac­tive on so­cial me­dia, sup­port­ing so­cial and hu­man­i­tar­ian cam­paigns. The fans re­cently raised more than US$1 mil­lion (S$1.36 mil­lion) for the Black Lives Mat­ter move­ment.</p>
    <p>Dy­na­mite notched 33.9 mil­lion US streams and 300,000 sales in its first week, ac­cord­ing to Nielsen</p>
    <p>Mu­sic data. BTS also scored their big­gest dig­i­tal sales week in nearly three years.</p>
    <p>While their in­tro­spec­tive 2018 al­bum Love Your­self: Tear was meant to show fans how the young stars dealt with and over­came their doubts and fears, the band said the new sin­gle was de­signed to give en­ergy to fans who might be grap­pling with coro­n­avirus gloom.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one should join hands to help fight the pan­demic, in which lift­ing peo­ple’s spir­its is vi­tal,” said vo­cal­ist Jimin, 24. “What we should and can do is give a bit of com­fort and re­fresh them – that’s an­other goal of ours.”</p>
    <p>BTS’ man­age­ment la­bel Big Hit En­ter­tain­ment said on Wed­nes­day that it plans to raise up to 962.6 bil­lion won (S$1.1 bil­lion) in an ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing of shares ex­pected next month.</p>
