    <p>NEW YORK • Af­ter falling prey to some of the same busi­ness dif­fi­cul­ties that have plagued news­pa­pers and mag­a­zines, dig­i­tal me­dia gi­ants Buz­zFeed and Huf­fPost have de­cided to join forces, the com­pa­nies an­nounced on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Un­der the plan, Buz­zFeed will ac­quire Huf­fPost from its owner, Ver­i­zon Me­dia, as part of a larger stock deal, the com­pa­nies said.</p>
    <p>The Buz­zFeed and Huf­fPost web­sites will re­main dis­tinct, each with its own ed­i­to­rial staff.</p>
    <p>Buz­zFeed founder Jonah Peretti, who helped found Huf­fPost 15 years ago, will serve as chief ex­ec­u­tive.</p>
    <p>As part of the ar­range­ment, Ver­i­zon Me­dia will be­come a mi­nor­ity share­holder in Buz­zFeed, the com­pa­nies said, but it will not have a seat on Buz­zFeed’s board.</p>
    <p>Mr Peretti said in a state­ment: “We’re ex­cited about our part­ner­ship with Ver­i­zon Me­dia, and mu­tual ben­e­fits that will come from syn­di­cat­ing con­tent across each other’s prop­er­ties, col­lab­o­rat­ing on in­no­va­tive ad prod­ucts and the fu­ture of com­merce, and tap­ping into the strength and cre­ativ­ity of Ver­i­zon Me­dia Im­mer­sive.”</p>
    <p>Buz­zFeed and Huf­fPost have strug­gled, with both hav­ing gone through rounds of lay­offs in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>Mr Peretti be­lieves that get­ting big­ger is the right move for his busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal me­dia, a rel­a­tively open ter­ri­tory when Huf­fPost started in 2005, has grown crowded and more com­pet­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Google and Face­book have grabbed huge chunks of ad rev­enue from pub­lish­ers.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter, Face­book, YouTube and Twitch are tak­ing would-be read­ers’ at­ten­tion, and many legacy me­dia out­lets have got the hang of the Web while also fig­ur­ing out how to per­suade read­ers to pay for con­tent.</p>
    <p>The deal be­tween Buz­zFeed and Huff</p>
    <p>Post marks the fourth sig­nif­i­cant merger among brand-name dig­i­tal pub­lish­ers, fol­low­ing the com­bi­na­tion of Vox Me­dia and New York Mag­a­zine, Vice Me­dia’s ac­qui­si­tion of Re­fin­ery29, and Group Nine’s merger with PopSu­gar.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal jour­nal­ism needs size to sur­vive and even these deals may not be enough to sus­tain their op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Be­cause Buz­zFeed and Huf­fPost ap­peal to dif­fer­ent read­er­ships, they should com­ple­ment each other as part of the same com­pany, Mr Peretti said in an in­ter­view on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>LIT­TLE OVER­LAP</p>
    <p>(below), Buz­zFeed founder who helped found Huf­fPost 15 years ago.</p>
    <p>“We want Huf­fPost to be more Huf­fPosty, and Buz­zFeed to be more Buz­zFeedy. There’s not much au­di­ence over­lap,” he said.</p>
    <p>“These are dif­fer­ent au­di­ences they serve. On the ed­i­to­rial side and the con­sumer side, we want to have a lot of in­de­pen­dence and au­ton­omy for Huf­fPost and for it to de­ter­mine its own brand.”</p>
    <p>Mr Peretti, 46, also said Huf­fPost will have a new ed­i­tor-in-chief.</p>
    <p>The site’s pre­vi­ous top ed­i­tor from 2016 un­til March this year was Ms Ly­dia Pol­green, a for­mer New York Times ed­i­tor.</p>
    <p>She left Huf­fPost to be­come the head of con­tent at pod­cast­ing com­pany Gim­let Me­dia, and a suc­ces­sor has yet to be named.</p>
    <p>On the busi­ness side, op­er­a­tions are likely to be com­bined.</p>
    <p>Huf­fPost had seen a large drop in rev­enue be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to two peo­ple with knowl­edge of the com­pany.</p>
    <p>Buz­zFeed caught on as a web­site filled with fea­tures aimed at a largely mil­len­nial au­di­ence, like “21 Pic­tures That Will Re­store Your Faith In Hu­man­ity” and a video of Buz­zFeed­ers try­ing to make a wa­ter­melon ex­plode.</p>
    <p>As the site ma­tured, it went deep into cur­rent events cov­er­age and in­ves­tiga­tive ar­ti­cles un­der Buz­zFeed News, a di­vi­sion that was led for eight years by its found­ing ed­i­tor Ben Smith, be­fore he joined The New York Times as its me­dia colum­nist, and is now run by Mr Mark Schoofs.</p>
    <p>But strug­gles lay ahead.</p>
    <p>In 2017, Buz­zFeed cut 100 em­ploy­ees af­ter miss­ing rev­enue tar­gets. Last year, it laid off more than 220 em­ploy­ees, or 15 per cent of its work­force.</p>
    <p>Amid the cost-cut­ting mea­sures, Buz­zFeed added ban­ner ads, a form of ad­ver­tis­ing it once es­chewed. It even ex­panded into the re­tail busi­ness, with branded prod­ucts, in­clud­ing a re­cent part­ner­ship to cre­ate sex toys.</p>
    <p>Huf­fPost cut 39 em­ploy­ees dur­ing a round of lay­offs in 2017.</p>
    <p>Early last year, Ver­i­zon said it would cut 800 po­si­tions, or 7 per cent of its me­dia di­vi­sions.</p>
    <p>Later that year, Huf­fPost let 11 video em­ploy­ees go.</p>
    <p>We want Huf­fPost to be more Huf­fPosty, and Buz­zFeed to be more Buz­zFeedy. There’s not much au­di­ence over­lap... On the ed­i­to­rial side and the con­sumer side, we want to have a lot of in­de­pen­dence and au­ton­omy for Huf­fPost and for it to de­ter­mine its own brand.</p>
