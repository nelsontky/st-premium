    <p>Liver­pool man­ager Jur­gen Klopp said he had “goose­bumps” as fans re­turned to An­field for the first time in nine months, roar­ing the Premier League cham­pi­ons on to a com­pre­hen­sive 4-0 win against Wolves on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The Reds have not had the chance to play in front of their sup­port­ers since March and had to hold their ti­tle-win­ning cer­e­mony af­ter a 30-year wait in front of an empty An­field back in June.</p>
    <p>But they made up for lost time, swag­ger­ing to a com­fort­able win as the 2,000 fans per­mit­ted to at­tend un­der coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions sang the club an­them You’ll Never Walk Alone.</p>
    <p>Wolves showed glimpses of a threat early on but the re­sult was rarely in doubt once Mo­hamed Salah had given the home side the lead mid­way through the first half.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond-half strikes by Ge­orginio Wi­j­nal­dum, Joel Matip and a late own goal from Nel­son Semedo un­der­lined Liver­pool’s su­pe­ri­or­ity as they joined lead­ers Tot­ten­ham on 24 points from 11 matches.</p>
    <p>“Wasn’t it the per­fect night? Imag­ine 10 months ago peo­ple would have told us we would have a game and 2,000 peo­ple would turn up,” an emo­tional Klopp said.</p>
    <p>“The game, the at­mos­phere, it was so nice I had goose­bumps. They started, ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’ – re­ally nice. I never knew it could feel that good.</p>
    <p>“This (pan­demic) started in Fe­bru­ary and we were wait­ing to get nor­mal­ity back. Nor­mal­ity is good – I don’t think we ap­pre­ci­ated it as much. It was very, very touch­ing.”</p>
    <p>The win was Liver­pool’s 31st in their last 32 home league games – they re­main un­beaten in the top flight at An­field since April 2017.</p>
    <p>And Klopp hopes that the fans are back to stay: “It is so much more en­joy­able with peo­ple in­volved.”</p>
    <p>Wi­j­nal­dum agreed, say­ing: “It was a great feel­ing they were back.</p>
    <p>“The fans helped the per­for­mance a lot be­cause they cheered dur­ing the game and be­fore, we only had the bench for sup­port.”</p>
    <p>There was even more good news for the Reds, who wel­comed back Trent Alexan­der-Arnold af­ter a month be­cause of in­jury, while Klopp also said Caoimhin Kelle­her had proven him­self as the club’s No. 2 goal­keeper ahead of Adrian.</p>
    <p>While first-choice stop­per Alis­son Becker is due to re­turn shortly af­ter two weeks out, Kelle­her has shown in his last two games that he is a bet­ter un­der­study than the 33-year-old Spa­niard.</p>
    <p>On the Ire­land Un­der-21 in­ter­na­tional, who made his league bow against Wolves, Klopp claimed he had “con­vinced ev­ery­body”, and pun­dits like Ian Wright and Jer­maine Je­nas also felt the Reds had un­earthed “an­other one”.</p>
