    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US Pres­i­den­t­elect Joe Bi­den has en­dorsed a US$908 bil­lion (S$1.2 tril­lion) stim­u­lus pro­posal by a bi­par­ti­san group of law­mak­ers, say­ing it “wouldn’t be the an­swer” but would pro­vide im­me­di­ate re­lief to those suf­fer­ing from the Covid-19 re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, speak­ing at a vir­tual round­table with work­ers and small busi­ness own­ers af­fected by the virus-re­lated down­turn, called on Congress on Wed­nes­day to pass a ro­bust Covid-19-re­lief Bill in the lame-duck ses­sion, which he said would “at best only be a down pay­ment” on a more com­pre­hen­sive Bill once he takes of­fice.</p>
    <p>But he said the bi­par­ti­san Bill ap­pears un­likely to pass as long as Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump re­mains in of­fice. “So it’s now back to square one again,” Mr Bi­den said.</p>
    <p>He was can­did about his own lim­i­ta­tions in get­ting a Bill passed be­fore he takes of­fice. “To state the ob­vi­ous, my abil­ity to get you help im­me­di­ately does not ex­ist,” he told the work­ers, who spoke of their dif­fi­cul­ties one by one.</p>
    <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Se­nate Mi­nor­ity Leader Chuck Schumer also threw their sup­port be­hind the pro­posal on Wed­nes­day, say­ing it should be the frame­work for ne­go­ti­a­tions with their Repub­li­can coun­ter­parts.</p>
    <p>Their en­dorse­ment of the plan drawn up by a group of House and Se­nate law­mak­ers marks the first pub­lic re­treat from their back­ing of a much larger US$2.4 tril­lion pan­demic re­lief pack­age – and could break six months of stale­mate in time to have a Bill passed be­fore the end of the year.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den said any l eg­isla­tive pack­age in the lame-duck ses­sion should in­clude an ex­ten­sion of un­em­ploy­ment in­sur­ance, re­sources for small busi­nesses to open safely, an evic­tion mora­to­rium and aid to state and lo­cal gov­ern­ments.</p>
    <p>“This isn’t a po­lit­i­cal game,” he said. “We need to get help out the door as soon as we can.”</p>
    <p>But he said Repub­li­cans seemed more fo­cused on a pro­vi­sion “guar­an­tee­ing there’s no li­a­bil­ity for busi­nesses if in fact they open and any­thing hap­pens”.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den was also crit­i­cal of the way pre­vi­ous re­lief ef­forts were run, and of big banks for not lend­ing to small busi­nesses that were not pre-ex­ist­ing cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>“One of the big prob­lems was that help went to a lot of peo­ple who didn’t need the help. It didn’t go to the peo­ple who badly needed it early on. Some of it did, but not nearly what it should have.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den also made a grim pre­dic­tion that the US would nearly dou­ble the num­ber of Covid-19 deaths if Amer­i­cans let their guard down over the year-end hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>“I don’t want to scare any­body here, but un­der­stand the facts: We’re likely to lose an­other 250,000 peo­ple... be­tween now and Jan­uary, be­cause peo­ple aren’t pay­ing at­ten­tion,” he said.</p>
