    <p>BUS ADS FOR TARCY SU’S 50TH BIRTH­DAY: Tai­wanese singer Tarcy Su turned 50 yes­ter­day and her fans gave her a big sur­prise by plac­ing ad­ver­tise­ments on</p>
    <p>10 buses to mark her birth­day.</p>
    <p>Her fans told Tai­wanese me­dia they were orig­i­nally plan­ning to send hand­writ­ten cards to their idol.</p>
    <p>How­ever, as this year also marked Su’s 30th year in show busi­ness, they de­cided to make a big­ger splash to cel­e­brate.</p>
    <p>Thirty fans came up with the money to place bus ads for a month from Oct 15 to Nov 14.</p>
    <p>The price tag was said to be about NT$100,000 (S$4,800).</p>
    <p>The ads were for bus ser­vice 299, which ap­peared in the mu­sic video for Su’s song Rose Of Taipei.</p>
    <p>The singer thanked her fans in a Face­book post. She wrote in Chi­nese: “This is prob­a­bly a spe­cial cel­e­bra­tion for a spe­cial num­ber? This is a price­less and touch­ing ges­ture, al­though I ques­tioned in my heart the need to spend so much money.</p>
    <p>“I men­tioned last year that a birth­day cel­e­bra­tion is not meant to boast how great I am in this world, but to re­mind my­self to be happy dur­ing our busy lives.</p>
    <p>“I hope you can re­mem­ber to be happy. Let’s clean the beach to­gether if the zeal re­mains next year.”</p>
    <p>Su was very pop­u­lar in the 1990s and is fa­mous for songs such as Lemon Tree, Duck and Fool. In March, she re­leased Ev­ery Side Of Me, her first al­bum in 13 years.</p>
    <p>She mar­ried busi­ness­man</p>
    <p>Jimmy Sun in 2014 and they have a five-year-old son.</p>
