    <p>Dur­ing lunchtime early last week, a steady trickle of peo­ple wan­dered into the gift shop of the Na­tional Gallery in Lon­don, brows­ing sou­venirs to mark their first visit to a mu­seum since Bri­tain be­gan emerg­ing from lock­down.</p>
    <p>Stay­ing so­cially dis­tanced, vis­i­tors glanced around racks that held Na­tional Gallery um­brel­las, Na­tional Gallery gin and Na­tional Gallery pen­cil cases.</p>
    <p>But many were quickly drawn to the mu­seum’s range of face masks.</p>
    <p>“They’re re­ally cool,” said Jes­sica Macdon­ald, 16, as she grabbed one fea­tur­ing Vincent van Gogh’s Sun­flow­ers, sell­ing for £9.50 (S$17).</p>
    <p>Point­ing at the blue med­i­cal mask she was wear­ing, she added: “My mum’s been try­ing to find nice ones for ages so we don’t have to wear th­ese.”</p>
    <p>Artist Lorna May Wadsworth, 40, bought a mask fea­tur­ing a flo­ral paint­ing by Am­bro­sius Boss­chaert the Elder, de­spite say­ing that, with her highly pat­terned out­fit, it made her look “like a Christ­mas tree”.</p>
    <p>The masks have been some of the gift shop’s big­gest sellers since the mu­seum re­opened on July 8, said store as­sis­tant Yumi Naka­jima.</p>
    <p>But not ev­ery­one was im­pressed. Ms Ali­son Ri­p­ley, 66, said she thought the flo­ral choices were tame.</p>
    <p>“Why not that?” she said, point­ing at a post­card of Diego Ve­lazquez’s The Toi­let Of Venus, which shows the god­dess ly­ing naked on a bed. “You’ve got to make masks funky if you want young­sters to wear them.”</p>
    <p>Ms Ju­dith Mather, the Na­tional Gallery’s buy­ing di­rec­tor, said in a tele­phone in­ter­view that the de­ci­sion to sell masks was last-minute.</p>
    <p>Last month, she said, she was in a su­per­mar­ket: “I was look­ing around at peo­ple, and their masks looked so sur­gi­cal and so ugly. I just thought some art would be re­ally dif­fer­ent and strik­ing.”</p>
    <p>For the Metropoli­tan Mu­seum of Art in New York, there has also been a fi­nan­cial in­cen­tive.</p>
    <p>Ms Leanne Gra­eff, a se­nior man­ager in the mu­seum’s prod­uct de­vel­op­ment team, said in a tele­phone in­ter­view that masks were an easy way for peo­ple to give money to mu­se­ums.</p>
    <p>The Met is al­ready sell­ing four masks on­line, fea­tur­ing im­pres­sion­ist paint­ings and New York scenes, and a larger range is ex­pected when the mu­seum is sched­uled to re­open late next month.</p>
    <p>Mask de­signs at mu­se­ums vary widely. The Uf­fizi in Florence, Italy, has stamped its logo all over its masks, rem­i­nis­cent of the way Ital­ian fash­ion houses do the same on hand­bags.</p>
    <p>The Tate, which runs sev­eral mu­se­ums in Bri­tain, has pre­pared a range of masks that fea­ture paint­ings such as JMW Turner’s The La­goon Near Venice, At Sun­set.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the mu­seum that has had the most suc­cess in sell­ing face masks is the Klimt Villa in Vi­enna, housed in one of Gus­tav Klimt’s former stu­dios.</p>
    <p>Ms Brigitte Hu­ber, a fash­ion de­signer and Klimt’s great-grand­daugh­ter, had sug­gested mak­ing masks to help raise funds for the pri­vate mu­seum.</p>
    <p>She came up with a sim­ple navy de­sign with a touch of white em­broi­dery rem­i­nis­cent of Klimt’s paint­ings and made the masks out of the same ma­te­rial used to make his paint­ing over­alls.</p>
    <p>The mu­seum, which re­opened in May, has sold more than 6,000 masks so far at €20 (S$32) each.</p>
    <p>But not ev­ery mu­seum is sell­ing masks to raise money for its own op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The St­edelijk art mu­seum i n Am­s­ter­dam is sell­ing masks de­signed by Car­los Amorales, a Mex­i­can artist whose ex­hi­bi­tion at the mu­seum was sus­pended by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The masks fea­ture a moth-like crea­ture that ap­pears to move when the wearer breathes in or talks. Amorales is us­ing the prof­its to make masks for Mex­i­can street work­ers.</p>
    <p>The St­edelijk might com­mis­sion more artists to de­sign masks, said mu­seum di­rec­tor Rein Wolfs in a tele­phone in­ter­view. “It’s a per­fect op­por­tu­nity when artists are strug­gling,” he said.</p>
