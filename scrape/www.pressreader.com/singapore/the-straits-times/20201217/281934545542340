    <p>Af­ter it be­came clear last month that the Demo­cratic Party’s Joe Bi­den had won the United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, Tai­wan’s me­dia head­lines re­flected the anx­i­ety of the Tai­wanese peo­ple over the re­sult.</p>
    <p>The China-friendly news­pa­per China Times asked: “Will a Bi­den win be ter­ri­ble for Tai­wan?”. The in­de­pen­dence-lean­ing news­pa­per Lib­erty Times’ head­line was more mea­sured: “Ne­ti­zens worry Bi­den will be China-friendly; MAC chair­man: Give him the ben­e­fit of the doubt”. The MAC is the Cabi­net-level Main­land Af­fairs Coun­cil that han­dles Tai­wan’s re­la­tions with China.</p>
    <p>Af­ter four years of bur­geon­ing re­la­tions be­tween Tai­wan and the US un­der Pres­i­dent Don­ald</p>
    <p>Trump, the Tai­wanese are wor­ried about a cool­ing of these ties un­der Mr Bi­den at a time when a strong re­la­tion­ship with the US is needed to counter the in­creas­ing pres­sure from Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>In­deed, a sur­vey in Oc­to­ber of the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion by poll­ster YouGov on the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion showed the Tai­wanese favoured Mr Trump to win, in con­trast to other parts of the re­gion where peo­ple pre­ferred a Bi­den vic­tory.</p>
    <p>Tai­wanese leg­is­la­tor Lo Chih-cheng, who is from the rul­ing Demo­cratic Pro­gres­sive Party (DPP), told the Fi­nan­cial Times that un­der Mr Trump, Tai­wan had be­come an as­set to the US and a lever­age in the US-China re­la­tion­ship. It was im­por­tant that Tai­wan did not “slip back to the curse of... be­ing treated as a li­a­bil­ity in the US-China re­la­tions”.</p>
    <p>Iron­i­cally, it was un­der</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Chen Shui-bian, also from the in­de­pen­dence-lean­ing DPP, that Tai­wan came to be seen as a li­a­bil­ity by Washington. Back in 2003, he pushed for a ref­er­en­dum that China saw as paving the way for a fu­ture vote on the is­land’s in­de­pen­dence. Mr Chen’s ac­tion, which riled the Chi­nese and did noth­ing for Amer­i­can na­tional se­cu­rity in­ter­ests, earned him a pub­lic re­buke from then Pres­i­dent Ge­orge W. Bush.</p>
    <p>That im­age of Tai­wan as a li­a­bil­ity un­der DPP rule might have in­flu­enced Pres­i­dent Barack Obama’s ad­min­is­tra­tion, which in 2011 pub­licly ex­pressed reser­va­tion about the DPP’s pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Tsai Ing-wen, who lost the elec­tion the fol­low­ing year. But she won the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in 2016 and was re-elected ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>The worry among Tai­wanese is that for­mer Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials, such as Mr Jake Sul­li­van and Mr Antony Blinken, who are Mr Bi­den’s choices for Na­tional Se­cu­rity Ad­viser and Sec­re­tary of State re­spec­tively, still view Tai­wan as a prob­lem.</p>
    <p>There is also the con­cern that in try­ing to re­set Amer­ica’s fraught ties with the Chi­nese, the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion may keep Tai­wan at arm’s length.</p>
    <p>But there are signs that the ad­min­is­tra­tion of Mr Bi­den, who will be sworn in next month, is un­likely to re­duce sub­stan­tive ties even if there may be fewer bells and whis­tles to the re­la­tion­ship than there were dur­ing the Trump years.</p>
    <p>TAI­WAN AS LEVER­AGE</p>
    <p>Tai­wan’s ties with the US have strength­ened un­der the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing this time, the US in­creased its arms sales to the is­land, which is re­garded by China as a break­away province to be re­uni­fied in time, by force if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can arms sales to Tai­wan – man­dated by the Tai­wan Re­la­tions Act of 1979 so that the is­land can de­fend it­self – to­talled more than US$18 bil­lion (S$24 bil­lion) in the past four years, com­pared with US$14 bil­lion un­der Mr Obama.</p>
    <p>These new pack­ages in­clude the sale of F-16 fighter jets, which marked the first time the US has sold fighter planes to Tai­wan since 1992 and a ma­jor shift from pre­vi­ous ad­min­is­tra­tions’ re­jec­tions of the is­land’s re­quests for such air­craft, which can be used of­fen­sively, so as not to an­tag­o­nise China.</p>
    <p>The US Congress also en­acted laws in 2018 that en­cour­age US mil­i­tary ships to make port calls in Tai­wan and se­nior US of­fi­cials to visit the is­land, some­thing that has been es­chewed in the past un­der Washington’s one-China pol­icy, which recog­nises Bei­jing as the sole le­gal gov­ern­ment of China. Un­der this pol­icy, the US has kept its ties with Tai­wan in­for­mal and of­fi­cial con­tacts largely be­tween lower-level of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, Mr Trump signed the Tai­wan Al­lies In­ter­na­tional Pro­tec­tion and En­hance­ment Ini­tia­tive Act that states the US should give sup­port to Tai­wan in its ef­forts to strengthen its ties with coun­tries and in­ter­na­tional bod­ies.</p>
    <p>Also this year, amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, two se­nior US of­fi­cials made high-pro­file vis­its to Tai­wan: Health Sec­re­tary Alex Azar in Au­gust, and Un­der­sec­re­tary of State Keith Krach in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Yet, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s use of Tai­wan as lever­age in its es­ca­lat­ing ri­valry with Bei­jing may cre­ate some un­cer­tainty for the is­land.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the sale of the F-16s was first given tacit ap­proval by the White House in March last year. How­ever, the for­mal nod was re­port­edly de­layed be­cause Washington was ne­go­ti­at­ing a trade agree­ment with Bei­jing and did not want the arms deal to jeop­ar­dise the talks. It was not un­til Au­gust that a de­ci­sion was made to pro­ceed with the sale.</p>
    <p>And high-pro­file vis­its like those made by Mr Azar and Mr Krach may spark un­wanted tur­bu­lence. To show its dis­plea­sure, China sent air­craft across the me­dian line in the Tai­wan Strait and con­ducted mil­i­tary drills in the Strait dur­ing the vis­its.</p>
    <p>Some have also pointed out that the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion could not pro­tect Tai­wan’s in­ter­na­tional space be­cause it had re­duced Amer­i­can in­flu­ence in sev­eral in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions and agree­ments by pulling out of them. For in­stance, Tai­wan’s quest to join the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship has been made un­cer­tain af­ter Mr Trump in 2017 pulled out of the trade agree­ment, now known as the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship.</p>
    <p>WHAT TO EX­PECT UN­DER BI­DEN</p>
    <p>The anx­i­ety in Tai­wan over Mr Bi­den stems from the ex­pe­ri­ence with the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion dur­ing which Mr Bi­den was the Vice-Pres­i­dent. The Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion was seen to have tried to en­sure US ties with Tai­wan did not mar re­la­tions with China, caus­ing de­lays in arms sales and in­fre­quent mu­tual vis­its .</p>
    <p>But there were also other fac­tors that af­fected the US-Tai­wan re­la­tion­ship at the time.</p>
    <p>Mr Obama’s eight years in of­fice (2009-2017) over­lapped with the ten­ure of the China-friendly Tai­wanese Pres­i­dent Ma Ying-jeou (2008-2016), who pri­ori­tised im­prov­ing cross-strait re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>“The US side ini­tially didn’t want to dis­rupt Ma’s rap­proche­ment,” noted Dr Kharis Tem­ple­man, a Tai­wan an­a­lyst with the Hoover In­sti­tu­tion at Stan­ford Univer­sity, in an e-mail in­ter­view. “Dur­ing the Ma era, the Tai­wan side didn’t ask for much, and the US side didn’t give much,” he added.</p>
    <p>Even so, the ties be­tween the two sides were sub­stan­tial both in terms of their re­la­tion­ship and in the broad­en­ing of Tai­wan’s in­ter­na­tional space.</p>
    <p>Apart from arms sales,</p>
    <p>Mr Obama also sent a</p>
    <p>Cabi­net-level of­fi­cial – the head of the En­vi­ron­men­tal Pro­tec­tion Agency – to Tai­wan, in 2014.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the Obama years, the two sides also launched the In­ter­na­tional En­vi­ron­men­tal Part­ner­ship (IEP) and the Global Co­op­er­a­tion and Train­ing Frame­work (GCTF) as ways to ex­pand Tai­wan’s in­ter­na­tional space.</p>
    <p>The IEP helps na­tions build ca­pac­i­ties in en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion, while the GCTF is a plat­form for Tai­wan to share its ex­per­tise in ar­eas such as pub­lic health and dis­as­ter re­lief with other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s re-en­gage­ment with in­ter­na­tional bod­ies, when it hap­pens – he has said the US will re­join the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion and the Paris cli­mate ac­cord – can do more to help Tai­wan widen its in­ter­na­tional space.</p>
    <p>Dr Tem­ple­man also ex­pects that the new pres­i­dent will keep in place many of the changes to Amer­ica’s Tai­wan pol­icy un­der the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, as these changes, in­clud­ing in­creased arms sales and will­ing­ness to send high-level of­fi­cials to Tai­wan in their of­fi­cial ca­pac­ity, were made largely in re­sponse to Bei­jing’s pres­sure cam­paign against Ms Tsai af­ter she came to power in 2016.</p>
    <p>Af­ter she failed to ac­knowl­edge the one-China prin­ci­ple, Bei­jing, among other things, cut off of­fi­cial con­tact with Tai­wan, wooed away Taipei’s diplo­matic al­lies and in­creased mil­i­tary drills in the Tai­wan Strait.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, Ms Tsai has been seen by the US as a re­li­able part­ner and a care­ful ste­ward of the US-Tai­wan re­la­tion­ship. “As long as... Bei­jing con­tin­ues to in­crease mil­i­tary and diplo­matic threats against Tai­wan, then the United States will con­tinue to sell arms and pro­vide other forms of sup­port to Tai­wan,” said Dr Tem­ple­man.</p>
    <p>Mr Ryan Hass of the Brook­ings In­sti­tu­tion noted in a re­cent ar­ti­cle that arms sales would slow down un­der Mr Bi­den’s ad­min­is­tra­tion not be­cause of ret­i­cence on his part, but rather Tai­wan’s mil­i­tary force struc­ture would take some time to ab­sorb the high vol­ume of re­cent sales.</p>
    <p>An­other rea­son that an­a­lysts be­lieve there would be a con­tin­u­a­tion of Mr Trump’s Tai­wan pol­icy is the bi­par­ti­san sup­port for Tai­wan in the US.</p>
    <p>Mr Hass noted that Ms Tsai and her ad­min­is­tra­tion have nur­tured this sup­port through per­sis­tent en­gage­ment with lead­ers and lead­ing thinkers on both sides of Amer­ica’s po­lit­i­cal aisle. When Ms Tsai was re-elected in Jan­uary, Mr Bi­den con­grat­u­lated her.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent-elect has also given an as­sur­ance that he would deepen ties with Tai­wan. In an op-ed in Oc­to­ber in the Tai­wanese-owned World Jour­nal, he said he would “stand with friends and al­lies” in Asia. “That in­cludes deep­en­ing our ties with Tai­wan, a lead­ing democ­racy, ma­jor economy, tech­nol­ogy pow­er­house – and a shin­ing ex­am­ple of how an open so­ci­ety can ef­fec­tively con­tain Covid-19,” he wrote, sig­nalling that Tai­wan is trea­sured for its com­mon val­ues and in­ter­ests with the US.</p>
    <p>In terms of geostrat­egy, Tai­wan is too im­por­tant to be over­looked, re­tired army of­fi­cer Lee Cheng-chieh was quoted as say­ing in the China Times ar­ti­cle with the anx­i­ety-laden head­line: “Will a Bi­den win be ter­ri­ble for Tai­wan?”. This is be­cause Tai­wan oc­cu­pies a strate­gic po­si­tion in the first is­land chain that hin­ders the pas­sage of Chi­nese war­ships into the Pa­cific Ocean.</p>
    <p>But more im­por­tantly, per­haps, Tai­wan would be viewed as a part­ner to be val­ued, not a card to be played in com­pe­ti­tion with China.</p>
    <p>Mr Hass wrote: “US pol­icy will be fo­cused on help­ing Tai­wan gain con­fi­dence in its se­cu­rity, con­trol of its eco­nomic des­tiny and dig­nity and re­spect on the world stage.”</p>
    <p>A softer, lower-key ap­proach by Mr Bi­den to­wards Tai­wan – even if it were to stem from a de­sire to keep US ties with China on an even keel – might not be a bad thing for Tai­wan. This would mean a calmer Tai­wan Strait that would be good for its peo­ple and its economy.</p>
    <p>It would also not have to deal with the mo­ments of un­cer­tainty that have some­times oc­curred dur­ing the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The Trump years have been heady ones for Tai­wan, be­gin­ning with Mr Trump as pres­i­dent-elect break­ing with con­ven­tion and ac­cept­ing a con­grat­u­la­tory call from Pres­i­dent Tsai, her­self just a few months in of­fice, back in 2016.</p>
    <p>But a qui­eter if no less sub­stan­tive re­la­tion­ship with the US, its most im­por­tant ally, should be a wel­come change for the is­land.</p>
