    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal Coun­cil (SMC) can take more than seven years to hear and de­cide a case against a doc­tor. Mean­while, in some cases, pa­tient safety may be at risk, says se­nior health cor­re­spon­dent Salma Kha­lik (be­low).</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Nasa’s most ad­vanced Mars rover, Per­se­ver­ance, launches from Earth on July 30, on a mis­sion to seek out signs of an­cient mi­cro­bial life on what was once a river delta 3½ bil­lion years ago.</p>
    <p>The in­ter­plan­e­tary voy­age will last six months.</p>
    <p>Should the SUV-sized ve­hi­cle touch down un­scathed, it will start col­lect­ing and stor­ing rock and soil sam­ples, to be re­trieved by a fu­ture mis­sion and brought back to Earth in 2031.</p>
    <p>Per­se­ver­ance fol­lows in the tyre tracks of four rovers be­fore it, all Amer­i­can, first launched in the late 1990s.</p>
    <p>To­gether with satel­lite and sur­face probes, they have trans­formed peo­ple’s un­der­stand­ing of Mars, show­ing that the Red Planet was not al­ways a cold and bar­ren place.</p>
    <p>In­stead, it had the in­gre­di­ents for life as we know it: wa­ter, or­ganic com­pounds and a favourable cli­mate.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists will ex­am­ine the sam­ples ob­tained by Per­se­ver­ance to look for fos­silised bac­te­ria and other mi­crobes to try to con­firm if aliens did once live on our neigh­bour­ing planet.</p>
    <p>Nasa has been tele­work­ing for months be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, but the launch cal­en­dar for this US$2.7 bil­lion (S$3.7 bil­lion) mis­sion has not been af­fected.</p>
    <p>“This mis­sion was one of two mis­sions that we pro­tected to make sure that we were go­ing to be able to launch in July,” said Nasa chief Jim Bri­den­s­tine.</p>
    <p>Earth and Mars are on the same side of the Sun every 26 months, a win­dow that can­not be missed.</p>
    <p>The United States is the only coun­try to have suc­cess­fully landed ro­bots on Mars: Four lan­ders, which are not mo­bile, and the rovers Pathfinder, Spirit, Op­por­tu­nity and Cu­rios­ity.</p>
    <p>Of the rovers, only Cu­rios­ity is still ac­tive, with the oth­ers left on the sur­face af­ter their ma­chin­ery failed or con­tact was lost.</p>
    <p>It was only in the past two decades that it was con­firmed Mars once had oceans, rivers and lakes.</p>
    <p>Cu­rios­ity con­firmed the pres­ence of com­plex or­ganic mol­e­cules – but its in­stru­ments are not ca­pa­ble of con­clud­ing that they were cre­ated by bi­o­log­i­cal pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>The first two lan­ders, Vik­ing 1 and 2, both looked for signs of life as far back as 1976, but hap­haz­ardly.</p>
    <p>“At the time, the ex­per­i­ment for life de­tec­tion was con­sid­ered to be a com­plete fail­ure,” said Dr G. Scott Hub­bard, who launched the cur­rent Mars ex­plo­ration pro­gramme in the 2000s.</p>
    <p>Nasa then de­cided to pro­ceed in stages. By study­ing the soil, analysing the molec­u­lar com­po­si­tion of rocks, and car­ry­ing out satel­lite ob­ser­va­tions, ge­ol­o­gists and as­tro­bi­ol­o­gists grad­u­ally un­der­stood where wa­ter had flowed, and what ar­eas could have been con­ducive to life.</p>
    <p>“Un­der­stand­ing where Mars would have been hab­it­able in the past, and what kind of fin­ger­prints of life you’re look­ing for, was a nec­es­sary pre­cur­sor to then go­ing, at sig­nif­i­cant ex­pense, to this very well se­lected spot that would pro­duce these sam­ples,” said Dr Hub­bard.</p>
    <p>On Feb 18 next year, Per­se­ver­ance should l and i n the Jezero Crater, home to an an­cient river that fanned out into a lake be­tween three bil­lion and four bil­lion years ago, de­posit­ing mud, sand and sed­i­ment.</p>
    <p>“Jezero is host to one of the best pre­served deltas on the sur­face of Mars,” said Dr Katie Stack Mor­gan, a mem­ber of the science team.</p>
    <p>On our planet, sci­en­tists have found the fos­silised re­mains of bac­te­ria bil­lions of years old in sim­i­lar an­cient deltas.</p>
    <p>The six-wheeled rover is 3m long, weighs a tonne, and has 19 cam­eras, two mi­cro­phones and a 2m-long ro­botic arm.</p>
    <p>Its most im­por­tant in­stru­ments are two lasers and an X-ray de­vice which, when pro­jected on rocks, can an­a­lyse their chem­i­cal com­po­si­tion and iden­tify pos­si­ble or­ganic com­pounds.</p>
    <p>Also on board is the ex­per­i­men­tal mini-he­li­copter In­ge­nu­ity, which weighs 1.8kg. Nasa hopes it will be the first chop­per to take flight on another planet.</p>
    <p>Per­se­ver­ance prob­a­bly will not be able to de­ter­mine whether a rock has an­cient mi­crobes. To know for sure, the sam­ples will have to be brought back to Earth where they can be cut into ul­tra­thin slices.</p>
    <p>“Get­ting true sci­en­tific con­sen­sus... that life once ex­isted on Mars, I think that would still re­quire a sam­ple re­turn,” said Dr Ken Wil­li­ford, deputy head of the science pro­ject.</p>
    <p>One thing we should not ex­pect are the fos­silised shells that peo­ple find on Earth, he added.</p>
    <p>If life once did ex­ist on Mars, it prob­a­bly did not have time to evolve into more com­plex or­gan­isms be­fore the planet dried up com­pletely. ig­nored a red light.</p>
    <p>The ac­ci­dent oc­curred af­ter 9.30pm lo­cal time on Tues­day near the town of Cesky Brod, about 30km east of Prague, on a busy rail­way con­nect­ing the cap­i­tal with the east of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral other mi­nor ac­ci­dents have been re­ported on Czech rail­ways over the past week.</p>
    <p>A week ago, two peo­ple died and dozens were in­jured when re­gional trains crashed in the western Czech Re­pub­lic.</p>
    <p>The trains crashed less than 1km away from Pernink sta­tion, CTK news agency re­ported. One of the trains was headed to Jo­han­nge­or­gen­stadt in Ger­many.</p>
