    <p>The pan­demic has ren­dered chil­dren alone and in­vis­i­ble. The irony is that they need not go far to ex­pe­ri­ence suf­fer­ing. Stud­ies have re­peat­edly shown of­fend­ers to be those whom chil­dren trust im­plic­itly – their care­givers – in their own homes.</p>
    <p>A three-year-old child is caned mul­ti­ple times, over sev­eral weeks. His small body is cov­ered in bruises – his arms and legs, even his chest is not spared. His fa­ther rou­tinely pun­ishes him for “mis­con­duct”, such as not in­form­ing him when his di­a­per is full.</p>
    <p>Trapped with an abu­sive par­ent for weeks at a stretch dur­ing a lock­down, the child’s cries are in­audi­ble to the out­side world.</p>
    <p>It is only when the boy’s grand­mother no­tices the bruises – some 10cm in length – that she re­ports the abuse to the po­lice and the child is treated in hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>That there should be no ex­cuse for abus­ing chil­dren and that their safety is a ba­sic hu­man right are max­ims we es­pouse in civil so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Yet, the fun­da­men­tal right to live with­out fear is be­ing de­nied to mil­lions of in­no­cent chil­dren around the world.</p>
    <p>Homes have be­come preda­tory zones of phys­i­cal and sex­ual as­sault, ex­pos­ing chil­dren to un­re­lent­ing forms of bru­tal­ity, prompt­ing United Na­tions un­der-sec­re­tary-gen­eral Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka to re­fer to the dele­te­ri­ous ef­fects of do­mes­tic vi­o­lence on mi­nors dur­ing Covid-19 lock­downs as a “shadow pan­demic”.</p>
    <p>SURGE IN FAM­ILY VI­O­LENCE</p>
    <p>Mal­treat­ment is in­dif­fer­ent to bor­ders and does not dis­crim­i­nate be­tween class or caste. Cases of do­mes­tic abuse rose un­abated in rich and poor coun­tries alike. France saw a 30 per cent jump in fam­ily vi­o­lence within the first two weeks of its shut­down and Sin­ga­pore re­ported a 22 per cent surge in the first month of its cir­cuit breaker in April.</p>
    <p>The most com­mon form of vi­o­lence against chil­dren is cor­po­ral pun­ish­ment and the most vul­ner­a­ble are those with dis­abil­i­ties and the very young.</p>
    <p>It is the si­lence sur­round­ing abuse that is deaf­en­ing. Even dur­ing nor­mal times, it lurks be­hind closed doors, with vic­tims afraid to call out per­pe­tra­tors for fear of reprisal and shame.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has ren­dered chil­dren alone and in­vis­i­ble. The irony is that they need not go far to ex­pe­ri­ence suf­fer­ing. Stud­ies have re­peat­edly shown of­fend­ers to be those whom chil­dren trust im­plic­itly – their care­givers – in their own homes.</p>
    <p>In fact, close to 300 mil­lion chil­dren – nearly three out of four world­wide – be­tween the ages of two and four ex­pe­ri­ence vi­o­lent dis­ci­pline by their care­givers on a reg­u­lar ba­sis.</p>
    <p>At school, teach­ers can catch tell­tale signs of de­pres­sion, no­tice in­juries or even ob­serve the silent dread in their eyes. The United Na­tions Chil­dren’s Fund (Unicef) warns that as class­rooms for half the world’s school­child­ren re­main closed, they are at an in­creased risk.</p>
    <p>A GRIM RE­AL­ITY</p>
    <p>Re­ports from South and</p>
    <p>South-east Asia re­veal a grim re­al­ity. The re­gion has seen a dev­as­tat­ing rise in vi­o­lence against women and chil­dren this year, in­ten­si­fy­ing the chal­lenges for gov­ern­ments al­ready grap­pling with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In the Philip­pines, which Unicef has found to be one of the top coun­tries pro­duc­ing child porno­graphic ma­te­ri­als glob­ally, the num­ber of on­line sex abuse in­stances against chil­dren more than tre­bled.</p>
    <p>In Thai­land, do­mes­tic vi­o­lence cases nearly dou­bled dur­ing its lock­down.</p>
    <p>In In­dia, the gov­ern­ment-led Child­line In­dia Helpline re­ceived over 92,000 SOS calls in just 11 days of the coun­try’s shut­down, and the de­mand for vi­o­lent con­tent in­volv­ing mi­nors, in­clud­ing child pornog­ra­phy, jumped over 200 per cent.</p>
    <p>In In­done­sia, even prior to the pan­demic, 60 per cent of chil­dren be­tween the ages of 13 and 17 re­ported one form of vi­o­lence dur­ing their life­time.</p>
    <p>The bur­den of job loss and fi­nan­cial pres­sures on fam­i­lies have a har­row­ing im­pact on mi­nors – mil­lions are see­ing their child­hood cut short by mar­riage, as well as ex­ploita­tive labour and other atroc­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The UN Pop­u­la­tion Fund pre­dicts a stag­ger­ing 13 mil­lion child mar­riages glob­ally over the next 10 years, due to im­pact from the pan­demic. These chill­ing sta­tis­tics should act as a clar­ion call for ac­tion be­fore more chil­dren fall through the cracks.</p>
    <p>Al­ter­ing age-old mind­sets and root­ing out prac­tices of pa­tri­archy that per­me­ate Asian so­ci­eties and ren­der women and chil­dren pow­er­less are what make change ar­du­ous to im­ple­ment and har­ness.</p>
    <p>The com­plex­i­ties of nav­i­gat­ing a cul­tural ter­rain that nor­malises gen­der bias and abu­sive be­hav­iour – such as hit­ting at home or bul­ly­ing in school – re­quire a sen­si­tive ap­proach and a blue­print that is unique to each so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>The stigma of de­nial and shame runs deep in Asian coun­tries, where do­mes­tic con­flict is re­garded as an in­ter­nal, pri­vate mat­ter and is rarely called out. Of­ten, pun­ish­ment is not con­sid­ered abuse but seen as a par­ent’s pre­rog­a­tive or duty, and this is a view that has long his­tor­i­cal roots. Even when per­pe­tra­tors are re­ported by so­cial work­ers, po­lice and the law of­ten fail to take ac­tion.</p>
    <p>There are glim­mers of hope. Coun­tries in South-east Asia are fi­nally be­gin­ning to ac­knowl­edge fam­ily vi­o­lence as a so­cial and pub­lic health cri­sis.</p>
    <p>It is heart­en­ing to see Sin­ga­pore’s ur­gent and vig­or­ous ef­forts to raise pub­lic aware­ness of this is­sue. In Fe­bru­ary, fol­low­ing an alarm­ing spike in cases, the Repub­lic spear­headed an in­ter-agency task force to de-es­ca­late do­mes­tic vi­o­lence and reach out to vic­tims be­fore it is too late. Made up of gov­ern­ment and com­mu­nity mem­bers, the task force rep­re­sents a “whole-of-so­ci­ety” ap­proach to com­bat this prob­lem.</p>
    <p>The idea be­hind this ini­tia­tive is that no one should be fear­ful of be­ing at home. Through check-ins via phone, video calls or home vis­its with safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures ob­served, vic­tims will be sup­ported, from the ini­tial re­port to the case’s con­clu­sion in the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem.</p>
    <p>In its in­ves­ti­ga­tions, the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment found that par­ents or step-par­ents made up a ma­jor­ity of those who beat their chil­dren. Get­ting peo­ple to break the si­lence is the big­gest chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>The task force is also plan­ning a one-stop ded­i­cated na­tional hot­line. Sim­i­lar ef­forts are un­der way at the grass­roots level across sev­eral Asean coun­tries – in­clud­ing In­done­sia, the Philip­pines and Thai­land.</p>
    <p>WHAT ABOUT THE RIGHTS CON­VEN­TION?</p>
    <p>Why is it that 30 years af­ter the adop­tion of the UN Con­ven­tion on the Rights of the Child – the world’s most widely rat­i­fied in­ter­na­tional hu­man rights treaty in his­tory – one bil­lion, or half the world’s chil­dren, still suf­fer in­juries, dis­abil­i­ties and death?</p>
    <p>The UN con­ven­tion was vi­sion­ary, the first time that global lead­ers col­lec­tively made a com­mit­ment to ev­ery child and de­clared any vi­o­lence against them as un­ac­cept­able. Amid much hope and prom­ise, they adopted a his­toric le­gal frame­work which for­mally recog­nised that child­hood is separate from adult­hood and lasts un­til age 18.</p>
    <p>The strik­ing fail­ure by many coun­tries to im­ple­ment ex­ist­ing laws is a global ig­nominy. A new, pi­o­neer­ing global re­port by the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) and Unicef found that while nearly 88 per cent of all coun­tries have laws in place to safe­guard mi­nors, less than half strongly en­force them.</p>
    <p>WHO warns of a dra­matic im­pact of Covid-19 on chil­dren, un­less coun­tries take im­me­di­ate steps to­wards their well-be­ing. The re­port re­it­er­ates what lead­ers said 30 years ago – that chil­dren are the vic­tims and never to blame.</p>
    <p>It is only when chil­dren are nur­tured and their safety pri­ori­tised that we can break the cat­a­strophic cy­cle of sys­temic vi­o­lence and em­brace the multi-gen­er­a­tional re­ward of a health­ier, hap­pier world.</p>
    <p>To­day, glob­ally, nearly one bil­lion care­givers be­lieve hit­ting chil­dren is an ac­cept­able dis­ci­plinary prac­tice. The def­i­ni­tion of phys­i­cal pun­ish­ment refers to shak­ing, hit­ting or slap­ping with a bare hand or with a hard ob­ject, on the face, head, ears or else­where on the body, beat­ing hard and re­peat­edly.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there is lit­tle proof that in­flict­ing phys­i­cal pain on chil­dren makes them more re­spon­si­ble cit­i­zens and con­trib­utes to their de­vel­op­men­tal health.</p>
    <p>On the con­trary, stud­ies con­sis­tently point to a strong link be­tween phys­i­cal abuse and higher lev­els of ag­gres­sion.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren who are beaten are more likely to do the same as adults and are at a higher risk of phys­i­cal and men­tal health prob­lems – in­clud­ing de­pres­sion, al­co­hol and drug abuse.</p>
    <p>Scientists tell us ex­po­sure to trau­matic ex­pe­ri­ences pro­duces toxic stress, which can al­ter the struc­ture and func­tion­ing of the brain dur­ing for­ma­tive early years. Care­givers need to be ed­u­cated to find pos­i­tive, non-vi­o­lent meth­ods of dis­ci­plin­ing their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>We need to put pres­sure on gov­ern­ment, busi­ness and com­mu­nity lead­ers to de­liver on their pledge to make a bet­ter world for our chil­dren.</p>
    <p>But gov­ern­ments can only do so much. Ul­ti­mately, it is the shared re­spon­si­bil­ity of each and ev­ery adult to en­sure that child­hood is not taken from the young. We owe our suc­ces­sive gen­er­a­tions an en­vi­ron­ment where their imag­i­na­tion and cu­rios­ity can flower, so that they can face the fu­ture with courage and com­pas­sion. As Ma­hatma Gandhi said: “If we are to cre­ate peace in our world, we must be­gin with our chil­dren.”</p>
