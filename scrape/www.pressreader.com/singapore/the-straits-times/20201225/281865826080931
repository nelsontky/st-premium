    <p>•</p>
    <p>Mil­lions of Covid-19 vac­cines are sit­ting un­used in US hospi­tals and else­where a week into a mas­sive in­oc­u­la­tion cam­paign, put­ting the gov­ern­ment’s tar­get for 20 mil­lion vac­ci­na­tions this month in doubt.</p>
    <p>More than a mil­lion Amer­i­cans have re­ceived the first dose of the vac­cines, a mile­stone in the big­gest im­mu­ni­sa­tion drive in United States his­tory, but of­fi­cials have ad­mit­ted the pace of roll-out is be­hind sched­ule.</p>
    <p>As of Wed­nes­day morn­ing, only one mil­lion shots of the Pfiz­erBioN­Tech vac­cine had been given, about one-third of the first ship­ment sent last week.</p>
    <p>At its cur­rent pace, the US ap­pears to have the ca­pac­ity to ad­min­is­ter less than a third of the shots that are shipped in a given week, un­der­scor­ing the gap.</p>
    <p>The news comes as the win­ter Covid-19 surge rages across the coun­try, where the virus has claimed over 320,000 lives and is on course to be the third-lead­ing cause of death for the year.</p>
    <p>Over 9.5 mil­lion doses of vac­cines, in­clud­ing Moderna’s, have now been sent to states across Amer­ica, ac­cord­ing to the US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion (CDC).</p>
    <p>Ten­nessee emerged along­side Cal­i­for­nia on Wed­nes­day as an epi­cen­tre of the lat­est Covid-19 surge, as US po­lit­i­cal lead­ers sought to guard against a highly con­ta­gious coro­n­avirus vari­ant sweep­ing across Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>While US hospi­tals have started giv­ing out Moderna’s vac­cine, the CDC has not yet re­ported that data and there may be a lag in re­port­ing shots given of both the Pfizer and Moderna vac­cines.</p>
    <p>The slow pace has barely picked up from the first week, when 614,000 shots were given, al­though nearly 2.9 mil­lion doses were shipped.</p>
    <p>Some hospi­tals said they ad­min­is­tered only about 100 shots on the first day of the vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>“The com­mit­ment that we can make is to make vac­cine doses avail­able,” US Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed chief ad­viser Mon­cef Slaoui said on a Wed­nes­day press call.</p>
    <p>He noted the rate of peo­ple get­ting a shot is “slower than we thought it would be”.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment’s goal is 100 mil­lion Pfizer and Moderna shots by March 1.</p>
    <p>US Army Gen­eral Gus­tave Perna said on Wed­nes­day that some de­liv­er­ies of the first 20 mil­lion doses will drag on un­til the first week of next month.</p>
    <p>The US Con­gress’ cur­rent coro­n­avirus aid pack­age sets aside more than US$8 bil­lion (S$10.63 bil­lion) for vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion but is de­layed.</p>
    <p>“You can’t hire some­one in De­cem­ber and train them up if you don’t know you can pay them in Jan­uary,” said Mr Adri­ane Casa­lotti, chief of gov­ern­ment and pub­lic af­fairs of the Na­tional As­so­ci­a­tion of County and City Health Of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Three states have now vac­ci­nated more than 1 per cent of their pop­u­la­tions: North Dakota, West Vir­ginia, and Alaska. Cal­i­for­nia leads in to­tal vac­ci­na­tions at 128,000 shots.</p>
    <p>China, which has sev­eral home­grown vac­cines, said on Dec 19 that it had reached the mil­lion­dose mile­stone. Those fig­ures in­clude some peo­ple who have al­ready taken a se­cond dose.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia has vac­ci­nated 440,000 peo­ple. Bri­tain is also mak­ing rapid progress in in­noc­u­lat­ing its pop­u­la­tion.</p>
