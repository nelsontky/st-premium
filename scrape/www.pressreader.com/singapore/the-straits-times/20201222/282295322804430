    <p>Telco StarHub an­nounced last Fri­day that it has ap­pointed Mr Nikhil Eapen as its new chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer. The ap­point­ment will take ef­fect on Jan 1 next year.</p>
    <p>The 48-year-old Sin­ga­porean was deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive of par­ent com­pany ST Tele­me­dia, a strate­gic in­vestor in com­mu­ni­ca­tions and me­dia, data cen­tres and the in­fra­struc­ture tech­nol­ogy busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>He pre­vi­ously worked as an in­vest­ment banker with Cit­i­group for over 18 years at the firm’s Hong Kong, New York and South-east Asian of­fices.</p>
    <p>StarHub chair­man Terry Clontz said: “This ap­point­ment is the re­sult of a rig­or­ous and ex­ten­sive global ex­ec­u­tive search.”</p>
    <p>Not­ing that Mr Eapen is “an ex­pe­ri­enced ex­ec­u­tive with a proven track record of re­gional achieve­ments and broad in­dus­try knowl­edge”, Mr Clontz said he and his fel­low di­rec­tors are con­fi­dent that the new CEO is “well qual­i­fied to lead StarHub in man­ag­ing the chal­lenges that op­er­a­tors face to­day, and to pur­sue new op­por­tu­ni­ties”.</p>
    <p>Mr Eapen will take over from Mr Peter Kaliaropou­los, 61, who stepped down on Oct 31 and re­turned to Syd­ney due to se­ri­ous health is­sues of a fam­ily mem­ber.</p>
    <p>StarHub said key cri­te­ria in se­lect­ing its new CEO i ncluded strong lead­er­ship, se­nior ex­ec­u­tive ex­pe­ri­ence in telco and ad­ja­cent in­dus­tries, and an un­der­stand­ing of the new mar­ket dy­nam­ics around in­tense com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>The com­pany added that the new CEO would also need to show a strong track record of suc­cess­ful cor­po­rate trans­for­ma­tion, with en­ter­prise and merger and ac­qui­si­tion back­grounds to grow the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Ex­pe­ri­ence in lead­ing di­verse teams to deal with rapid changes in this highly com­pet­i­tive en­vi­ron­ment was also re­quired.</p>
    <p>StarHub noted: “Mr Eapen brings 20 years of ex­pe­ri­ence in the global in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy sec­tor work­ing with se­nior ex­ec­u­tive teams to drive growth and make syn­er­gis­tic in­vest­ments in in­fra­struc­ture and en­ter­prise com­mu­ni­ca­tions and tech­nol­ogy, most re­cently build­ing and ac­quir­ing cloud-cen­tric plat­forms in IT, cy­ber se­cu­rity and en­ter­prise soft­ware.”</p>
    <p>From 2008 to 2015, Mr Eapen was the man­ag­ing di­rec­tor and head of Asia-Pa­cific tech­nol­ogy, me­dia and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions, as well as cor­po­rate and in­vest­ment bank­ing, at Cit­i­group.</p>
    <p>He was based in Hong Kong, where he led cap­i­tal mar­kets and merger and ac­qui­si­tion trans­ac­tions across South-east Asia, Greater China, In­dia and the United States.</p>
    <p>He holds a Bach­e­lor of Sci­ence with Hon­ours in Eco­nom­ics from Univer­sity Col­lege Lon­don.</p>
    <p>He is mar­ried and has two daugh­ters and a son.</p>
