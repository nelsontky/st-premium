    <p>An ex­pert wit­ness yes­ter­day told the High Court that a Face­book post shar­ing an ar­ti­cle with “shock­ing” al­le­ga­tions about Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong would have spread more quickly than ar­ti­cles cor­rect­ing the fake news. He es­ti­mated that blog­ger Leong Sze Hian’s post would have ap­peared on the Face­book news feeds of 11,749 users.</p>
    <p>An ex­pert wit­ness yes­ter­day told the High Court that a Face­book post shar­ing an ar­ti­cle with “shock­ing” al­le­ga­tions about Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong would have spread more quickly than ar­ti­cles cor­rect­ing the fake news.</p>
    <p>Dr Phan Tuan Quang from the Hong Kong Univer­sity Business School, tes­ti­fy­ing at the defama­tion trial against blog­ger Leong Sze Hian, had es­ti­mated that Mr Leong’s post would have ap­peared on the Face­book news feeds of 11,749 users.</p>
    <p>But this was char­ac­terised as “guess­work” by Mr Leong’s lawyer Lim Tean, who pointed out the aca­demic did not have ac­tual data about the post to work with.</p>
    <p>The vi­ral­ity of Mr Leong’s post, which con­tained a link to an ar­ti­cle falsely con­nect­ing PM Lee to the 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had (1MDB) cor­rup­tion scan­dal, came un­der scru­tiny as PM Lee watched on in the court­room on the sec­ond day of the hear­ing.</p>
    <p>Dr Phan, an as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of in­no­va­tion and in­for­ma­tion man­age­ment with 15 years of re­search ex­pe­ri­ence on so­cial me­dia un­der his belt, had said a min­i­mum of 200 to 400 Sin­ga­pore­ans would have ac­cessed the post and the ar­ti­cle.</p>
    <p>These were very con­ser­va­tive es­ti­mates that took into ac­count fac­tors like the Gov­ern­ment’s re­but­tals of the ar­ti­cle which had been widely pub­lished by news out­lets, he added.</p>
    <p>But Mr Lim said the fig­ures were ques­tion­able as Dr Phan “had hardly any data, or ev­i­dence to work on, and your en­tire report is based on a se­ries of as­sump­tions”. Dis­agree­ing, Dr Phan said he had worked with Face­book’s data sci­ence teams quite ex­ten­sively and pub­lished four pa­pers on their data set.</p>
    <p>His es­ti­mates were based on pub­lic Face­book data and sta­tis­ti­cal analysis, he added. “What I’m pre­sent­ing is both pub­lic re­search and ex­pert com­ments and views on how many peo­ple might have seen the post... It’s not base­less.”</p>
    <p>While he did not get to see Mr Leong’s Face­book post which was taken down by Nov 10, 2018, Dr Phan said he did see screen­shots of the post and Mr Leong’s time­line.</p>
    <p>He also said the fig­ures quoted were the “least num­ber of peo­ple” who might have seen the post.</p>
    <p>Ow­ing to the “shock­ing” na­ture of the al­le­ga­tions – the ar­ti­cle had said that PM Lee was “cor­rupted” and had al­lowed the banks here to abet for­mer Malaysian premier Na­jib Razak in money laun­der­ing – the post and ar­ti­cle would have been novel to peo­ple, he added.</p>
    <p>He fur­ther said that re­searchers have found this “nov­elty” fac­tor con­trib­utes to the vi­ral­ity of fake news.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim coun­tered that the lon­grun­ning 1MDB saga had been cov­ered in the news ex­ten­sively and could not have been novel by the time Mr Leong shared the ar­ti­cle.</p>
    <p>To this, Dr Phan said: “It is novel be­cause of the con­nec­tion with Mr Lee... (The ar­ti­cle) was quite shock­ing, that’s why it was cov­ered...</p>
    <p>“Oth­er­wise, it would not be men­tioned and we wouldn’t be here.”</p>
    <p>He added that based on his re­search, fake news moves faster than real news and can reach a “max­i­mum pen­e­tra­tion” in 1,000 minutes, or about 16 hours.</p>
    <p>This means a par­tic­u­lar post by a per­son can reach his friends and friends of his friends, all the way down a chain that is 15 lev­els re­moved from him in that time.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim then re­ferred to news re­ports about gov­ern­ment agen­cies and of­fi­cials re­fut­ing the al­le­ga­tions, ask­ing Dr Phan if peo­ple who saw Mr Leong’s post might have seen the news re­ports and been aware that the ar­ti­cle is bo­gus.</p>
    <p>Yes, Dr Phan said, adding that he had taken this into con­sid­er­a­tion in de­ter­min­ing the spread of the post.</p>
    <p>He also agreed with Mr Lim that more peo­ple might have seen the re­but­tals than Mr Leong’s post.</p>
    <p>But he said there was rea­son to be­lieve the peo­ple who saw Mr Leong’s post may not be the same as those who would have read the re­but­tals in the main­stream me­dia.</p>
    <p>The al­go­rithm of Face­book pri­ori­tises con­tent on peo­ple’s news feeds based on their pro­cliv­i­ties, he said, adding: “It’s been well stud­ied that peo­ple who fol­low cer­tain char­ac­ters or per­son­al­i­ties on so­cial me­dia are look­ing for cer­tain in­for­ma­tion.”</p>
    <p>Dr Phan’s in­de­pen­dence was also called into doubt yes­ter­day, with Mr Lim say­ing that since he had pre­vi­ously re­ceived re­search grants from the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment and its agen­cies, he could not be said to be in­de­pen­dent.</p>
    <p>One such grant from the Min­istry of Education, awarded to a re­search team that Dr Phan was a part of when he was a pro­fes­sor at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore from Au­gust 2011 to May this year, had come up to $8.2 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim charged: “Your ev­i­dence is tainted by the fact that you have a past re­la­tion­ship with the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment of which (Mr Lee) is the head.”</p>
    <p>Main­tain­ing that he has no past or present re­la­tion­ship with PM Lee and had never met him in per­son, Dr Phan said it was com­mon for aca­demics to work on re­search projects in­volv­ing gov­ern­ment bod­ies and to get such grants. He also said they were ob­jec­tively awarded by an as­sort­ment of in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>As an aca­demic, he had the free­dom to do un­bi­ased re­search, he added. He also noted that the re­search di­rec­tion is de­cided not by one per­son, but by a team in­clud­ing re­searchers out­side Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Mr Lim, I am here to as­sist the court...When some­thing is true, it is true. There is a truth. I can­not put it in other ways,” he said.</p>
