    <p>The in­comes of Sin­ga­pore’s work­ers at the 10th per­centile in­creased by more than 50 per cent over the past decade to $1,517 last year, said Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Man­power Zaqy Mo­hamad.</p>
    <p>Full-time res­i­dent work­ers at this per­centile had earned $1,000 in 2009, which il­lus­trates the progress made un­der Sin­ga­pore’s pol­icy mea­sures, he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is also pro­gres­sively nar­row­ing the in­come gap be­tween its lower-wage work­ers and those in the mid­dle, said Mr Zaqy yes­ter­day, dur­ing the de­bate on the Gov­ern­ment’s strate­gies to tackle Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Real in­comes have in­creased by about 30 per cent in the three sec­tors where the pro­gres­sive wage model (PWM) has been im­ple­mented, out­pac­ing the real in­come growth of 21 per cent at the me­dian for all sec­tors, he said.</p>
    <p>The PWM is a wage lad­der that sets out min­i­mum pay and train­ing re­quire­ments for work­ers at dif­fer­ent skill lev­els.</p>
    <p>And for the over­all work­force, in­clud­ing sec­tors that have not im­ple­mented the PWM, real in­comes of full-time em­ployed res­i­dent work­ers at the 20th per­centile have also in­creased cu­mu­la­tively more than the me­dian, said Mr Zaqy.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has thus far man­aged to lift wages while keep­ing un­em­ploy­ment low, he said, adding that it is sen­si­tive to the risk of dis­em­ploy­ment – work­ers los­ing their jobs. He cited stud­ies which show the “dis­em­ploy­ment ef­fects” of a min­i­mum wage could be stronger for cer­tain groups of work­ers.</p>
    <p>Scan­di­na­vian coun­tries such as Nor­way and Den­mark demon­strate that it is pos­si­ble for na­tions to have a strong so­cial com­pact with­out a min­i­mum wage, he said. “These coun­tries have ro­bust di­a­logues be­tween stake­hold­ers, re­sult­ing in col­lec­tive agree­ments on wages at the sec­toral level.”</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ja­mus Lim (Sengkang GRC) said pro­pos­als about the min­i­mum wage should not be made on the ba­sis of in­di­vid­ual stud­ies. He said that the $1,300 min­i­mum wage pro­posed by the Work­ers’ Party would fall far be­low the min­i­mum wage of al­most ev­ery other de­vel­oped coun­try.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Mr Zaqy said his point was that aca­demic stud­ies on the ef­fects of min­i­mum wage are hotly con­tested, and it is dif­fi­cult to come to a con­clu­sive po­si­tion based on such stud­ies alone.</p>
    <p>Prof Lim also pointed out that while Scan­di­na­vian coun­tries do not have a min­i­mum wage, that is in part be­cause they have high union­i­sa­tion rates of 70 per cent to 80 per cent, so “there is a very strong col­lec­tive bar­gain­ing rep­re­sen­ta­tion”.</p>
    <p>Mr Zaqy said Sin­ga­pore has a sim­i­lar sys­tem of tri­par­tite ne­go­ti­a­tion that has helped raise the in­comes of low-wage work­ers. He said the Gov­ern­ment is se­ri­ous about im­prov­ing the lot of low-wage work­ers. That is why it has set up a tri­par­tite work group to study how to fur­ther lift their wages. It is also study­ing how to pro­vide ad­di­tional sup­port to work­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans, in­clud­ing the self-em­ployed, should they have pro­longed in­come loss.</p>
    <p>Mr Zaqy also as­sured Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang) that the Gov­ern­ment is aware of the chal­lenges ma­ture work­ers face in chang­ing ca­reers. About 6,100 mid-ca­reer job seek­ers switched to new oc­cu­pa­tions this year with the help of ca­reer con­ver­sion pro­grammes, he said.</p>
    <p>Hir­ing is still tak­ing place in sec­tors badly hit by Covid-19, Mr Zaqy added, cit­ing tourism and re­tail, where busi­ness mod­els are chang­ing fast. “It is there­fore im­por­tant to not write them off,” he said.</p>
