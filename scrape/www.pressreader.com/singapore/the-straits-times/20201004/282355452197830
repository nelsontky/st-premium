    <p>Just as work­ing from home has in­sid­i­ously eaten into pre­cious fam­ily time and “me” time, all work and no play takes the fun out of an ex­tended worka­tion.</p>
    <p>One cou­ple, two ho­tels, 15 days of “worka­tion”. What did I do to de­serve this?</p>
    <p>When my hus­band broached the idea of a work­ing stay­ca­tion last month, my heart leapt the way it does when he says we have enough miles for busi­ness class.</p>
    <p>After seven months with­out a hol­i­day, we were des­per­ate for a change of scenery.</p>
    <p>Be­sides, work­ing from home had be­come un­bear­able, thanks to the au­ral as­sault of jack­ham­mers and ex­ca­va­tors from our neigh­bour’s am­bi­tious re­build­ing project, which spanned three houses.</p>
    <p>My hus­band was not al­lowed to re­turn to the of­fice then, but ho­tels had be­gun open­ing up for stay­cays, which proved for­tu­itous as cor­po­rate rates were very at­trac­tive.</p>
    <p>We stayed at a four-star ho­tel in Beach Road for five days and an­other 10 days at a five-star ho­tel off Or­chard Road.</p>
    <p>As I glee­fully packed travel-size toi­letries, I pic­tured my­self loung­ing pool­side with my lap­top and tak­ing long bub­ble baths be­tween in­spired bouts of cre­ativ­ity. A work­ing stay­cay would be the clos­est I could get to be­ing a dig­i­tal no­mad with­out aban­don­ing my teenagers (who, as it turned out, hardly no­ticed I was out of the house).</p>
    <p>After the ini­tial eu­pho­ria of check­ing out the room – Fil­tered tap wa­ter! Four types of tea! L’Oc­c­i­tane bath gel! – we both hun­kered down to work.</p>
    <p>In­vari­ably, one of us would get the bet­ter chair and the other would risk a neck-ache by work­ing at the cof­fee ta­ble or on the bed.</p>
    <p>My hus­band, whose fre­quent overseas trips for his tech job have been re­placed by a mind-numb­ing itin­er­ary of con­fer­ence calls start­ing as early as 7am and some­times end­ing past mid­night, likes to blast his calls through his por­ta­ble speaker.</p>
    <p>That was not an is­sue at home when I could work in the study, but with both of us con­fined to a room, it be­gan to grate on my nerves.</p>
    <p>We even­tu­ally set­tled into a worka­tion rou­tine: an early morn­ing swim fol­lowed by work and more work, punc­tu­ated by quick trips out for a bite.</p>
    <p>As the days merged with one an­other, sourc­ing for all our meals</p>
    <p>be­came a chore and I felt a twinge of envy ev­ery time I saw other guests hav­ing fun at the fa­cil­i­ties while I was on my way back to work.</p>
    <p>My fan­tasy of work­ing pool­side never ma­te­ri­alised – I for­got I’d have to wear a mask in the heat and queue for a lounge bed.</p>
    <p>To my hus­band, who is used to work­ing out of a suitcase any­where in the world, the worka­tion was sim­ply an­other day in the of­fice.</p>
    <p>To me, the land-bound spouse, a ho­tel stay means so much more. It ro­mances your senses, im­merses you in in­dul­gence and makes you feel spe­cial. Work­ing from a ho­tel for one day was novel and ex­cit­ing, but work­ing from one for half a month be­came te­dious and claus­tro­pho­bic at times.</p>
    <p>What I should have done was take a day off and break out of my gilded cage: use the spa, ex­plore the neigh­bour­hood and splurge on a ho­tel din­ner or pool­side lunch.</p>
    <p>Just as work­ing from home has in­sid­i­ously eaten into pre­cious fam­ily time and “me” time, all work and no play takes the fun out of an ex­tended worka­tion.</p>
    <p>At the same time, I would love to see worka­tion pack­ages that in­clude mas­sage perks, er­gonomic desks and chairs for a cou­ple, and in-room break­fasts that are value for money in­stead of just plain over­priced.</p>
    <p>With many of us still ex­pected to work from home well into next year, a thought­fully cu­rated worka­tion pack­age might just be what Zoom-fa­tigued ex­ec­u­tives need to keep them mo­ti­vated.</p>
    <p>Well, at least that’s what I’ll be pitch­ing to my hus­band for an­other work­ing stay­cay. Wish me luck.</p>
