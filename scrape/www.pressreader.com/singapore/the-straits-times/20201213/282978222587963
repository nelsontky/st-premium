    <p>De­spite the gloomy weather and soggy track, Shanti Pereira was grin­ning from ear to ear af­ter her race at the Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics (SA) Per­for­mance Trial 2 event at the Home of Ath­let­ics yes­ter­day evening.</p>
    <p>Un­der a steady driz­zle, she clocked 11.69 sec­onds in the 100m, just 0.03sec be­hind her bronzemeda­l time at the 2019 SEA Games in the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>That is also the qual­i­fy­ing benchmark for the next edi­tion of the bi­en­nial event in Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>Pereira, 24, had al­ready earned a ticket to Viet­nam af­ter clock­ing 23.72sec in the 200m at the SA Per­for­mance Se­ries Trial 1 event two weeks ago, bet­ter­ing the 23.77sec she had set en route to a bronze in the event as well.</p>
    <p>What made her times over the re­cent weeks re­mark­able, how­ever, is that in ad­di­tion to the less-thanideal weather con­di­tions yes­ter­day, they were her first races since the SEA Games at New Clark City slightly over a year ago.</p>
    <p>Beam­ing, Pereira said: “The fact I could run these kind of tim­ings in a sit­u­a­tion where I couldn’t even race all year (be­cause of the pan­demic) – and things were tough dur­ing cir­cuit breaker for train­ing – I’m very, very sat­is­fied.</p>
    <p>“Plus, I don’t think I’ve run these kind of tim­ings in a lo­cal com­pe­ti­tion be­fore.”</p>
    <p>Her per­sonal bests in the 100m (11.58sec) and 200m (23.60sec), which are na­tional records, were set at the 2019 Asian Ath­let­ics Cham­pi­onship in Qatar, and 2015 SEA Games in Sin­ga­pore, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Her coach, Luis Cunha, was also pleased with his charge’s per­for­mances, which he be­lieves shows she is on the right track.</p>
    <p>Pereira linked up with Cunha only in Jan­uary af­ter part­ing ways with long-time men­tor Mar­garet Oh, who had coached her since she was 14.</p>
    <p>Said the Por­tuguese coach: “We knew she would have many op­por­tu­ni­ties to qual­ify (for Viet­nam), so this event was more a test to see how the year with­out com­pe­ti­tion went.</p>
    <p>“Not only from her times but also the way she ran, I can see she is pro­gress­ing in the way I want. But the idea is not just to im­prove in these small meets, but also in ma­jor com­pe­ti­tions.”</p>
    <p>Pereira, who mem­o­rably won the 200m at the 2015 SEA Games for Sin­ga­pore’s first sprint gold in 42 years and clinched bronzes in the 100m and 200m at each of the last two edi­tions of the bi­en­nial meet, be­lieves the part­ner­ship with Cunha will bear fruit.</p>
    <p>“I’m very happy to be work­ing with him, and I think both of us have been en­joy­ing our­selves this</p>
    <p>NOT IN SIN­GA­PORE</p>
    <p>I don’t think I’ve run these kind of tim­ings in a lo­cal com­pe­ti­tion be­fore. na­tional sprinter.</p>
    <p>year,” she said.</p>
    <p>“This year has been tough with Covid but it has given me a chance to get used to his train­ing (meth­ods) and un­der­stand how he works, and he gets to un­der­stand how I work…</p>
    <p>“I’m happy with where I am and ex­cited for what’s to come.”</p>
    <p>SHANTI PEREIRA,</p>
