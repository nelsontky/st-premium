    <p>Pooled test­ing can re­duce the use of re­sources, and this strat­egy can be used i n set­tings where the Covid-19 preva­lence is low as well as higher-risk ar­eas like dor­mi­to­ries, said the Health Min­istry’s di­rec­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices Ken­neth Mak.</p>
    <p>Asked about the ra­tio­nale for such tests at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Mak ex­plained that pooled tests in­volve us­ing one Covid-19 test on a group of sus­pect cases in­stead of on one per­son.</p>
    <p>When used for rou­tine test­ing in the com­mu­nity, such tests are con­ducted by bring­ing peo­ple in an at-risk group to­gether.</p>
    <p>If the pooled test yields a pos­i­tive re­sult, all the peo­ple who were part of the group will then be in­di­vid­u­ally tested to de­ter­mine who had Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In dor­mi­to­ries, how­ever, pooled test­ing is con­ducted as part of a se­ries of steps in the process of clear­ing the dorms of Covid-19, said Prof Mak.</p>
    <p>A pre­lim­i­nary screen­ing is of­ten first done in the var­i­ous dorms to get a sense of whether the preva­lence rates of Covid-19 in­fec­tion in the dorm are high or low, he noted.</p>
    <p>Sub­se­quently, if the au­thor­i­ties de­cide test­ing in the dorm can con­tinue, work­ers will be grouped based on their liv­ing ar­range­ments, and a pooled test will be con­ducted on them.</p>
    <p>A de­ci­sion will then be made on whether in­di­vid­ual PCR (poly­merase chain re­ac­tion) tests are re­quired based on the pooled tests, he added.</p>
    <p>This is why a higher num­ber of cases from dorms are now be­ing re­ported, as the au­thor­i­ties are now sub­ject­ing those with pre­vi­ous pos­i­tive pooled tests to in­di­vid­ual tests, he said.</p>
    <p>PCR tech­nol­ogy de­tects the pres­ence of vi­ral ge­netic ma­te­rial in pa­tient sam­ples.</p>
