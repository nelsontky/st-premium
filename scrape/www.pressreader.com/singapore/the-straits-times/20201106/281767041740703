    <p>The pub­lic had handed in more than 20,000 mo­bile phone videos that the au­thor­i­ties an­a­lysed be­fore com­ing to the con­clu­sion that there was only one gun­man.</p>
    <p>VI­ENNA • Mo­bile phone footage has con­firmed that the ter­ror­ist who killed four peo­ple in a ram­page in Vi­enna on Mon­day was the only gun­man, and Aus­tria had fum­bled in­tel­li­gence on him, In­te­rior Min­is­ter Karl Ne­ham­mer has said.</p>
    <p>Aus­tria has ar­rested 14 peo­ple aged 18 to 28 in con­nec­tion with the at­tack and is i nves­ti­gat­ing them on sus­pi­cion of be­long­ing to a ter­ror­ist or­gan­i­sa­tion, Mr Ne­ham­mer said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>It would also have to in­ves­ti­gate its own ac­tions, he added.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore the ter­ror at­tack be­gan, ac­cord­ing to the in­for­ma­tion cur­rently avail­able, some things also went wrong,” Mr Ne­ham­mer said.</p>
    <p>In July, neigh­bour­ing Slo­vakia’s in­tel­li­gence ser­vice had handed over in­for­ma­tion sug­gest­ing the at­tacker had tried and failed to buy am­mu­ni­tion there, said Mr Ne­ham­mer and di­rec­tor-gen­eral for pub­lic se­cu­rity Franz Ruf.</p>
    <p>“In the next steps, ev­i­dently some­thing went wrong here with com­mu­ni­ca­tions,” said Mr Ne­ham­mer, who called for the for­ma­tion of an in­de­pen­dent com­mis­sion to ex­am­ine the er­rors made.</p>
    <p>Af­ter re­ceiv­ing the tip-off from Slo­vakia, Aus­tria’s do­mes­tic in­tel­li­gence agen­cies at the fed­eral and pro­vin­cial lev­els made the nec­es­sary checks and sent ques­tions back to Bratislava, Mr Ruf said.</p>
    <p>“It’s up to the com­mis­sion to clar­ify whether the process went op­ti­mally and in line with the law,” he told the me­dia, when pressed on what had gone wrong.</p>
    <p>Aus­tria’s Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil signed off on set­ting up the com­mis­sion later on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The gun­man, who was shot dead by po­lice within min­utes of open­ing fire, was Ku­j­tim Fe­jzu­lai, a 20-year-old with dual Aus­trian and North Mace­do­nian cit­i­zen­ship. Born and raised in Vi­enna, he had al­ready been con­victed of try­ing to reach Syria to join the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), and had spent time in jail.</p>
    <p>All of those ar­rested in Aus­tria</p>
    <p>on Tues­day have a “mi­gra­tion back­ground”, Mr Ne­ham­mer said.</p>
    <p>Vi­enna po­lice chief Ger­hard Puer­stl added that some were dual</p>
    <p>cit­i­zens of Bangladesh, North Mace­do­nia, Turkey or Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>Aus­tria, which is part of the United States-led Global Coali­tion to De­feat ISIS formed in 2014, has for years seen mil­i­tant at­tacks as its big­gest se­cu­rity threat and warned of the dan­ger posed by for­eign fight­ers re­turn­ing from Iraq or Syria.</p>
    <p>At the end of 2018, the au­thor­i­ties knew of 320 peo­ple from Aus­tria who were ac­tively in­volved or had wanted to par­tic­i­pate in wars in Syria and Iraq.</p>
    <p>Of these, around 58 peo­ple were thought to have died in the re­gion and 93 to have re­turned to Aus­tria.</p>
    <p>An­other 62 were pre­vented from leav­ing the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Ne­ham­mer on Wed­nes­day re­peated crit­i­cism of a de­rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion pro­gramme, say­ing the gun­man had “per­fectly” fooled the pro­gramme, which seeks to rein­te­grate ter­ror­ists into so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>But Mr Moussa Al-Has­san Diaw, a co-founder of Derad, the or­gan­i­sa­tion that runs the pro­gramme, re­jected Mr Ne­ham­mer’s as­ser­tion, telling Reuters: “It was al­ways clear that this per­son was in no way de­rad­i­calised.”</p>
    <p>The pub­lic had handed in more than 20,000 mo­bile phone videos that the au­thor­i­ties an­a­lysed be­fore com­ing to the con­clu­sion that there was only one gun­man, Mr Ne­ham­mer said, putting an end to con­fu­sion on that point.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Switzer­land has ar­rested two men in con­nec­tion with the at­tack. Its jus­tice min­is­ter said the two were “ob­vi­ously friends” with the gun­man.</p>
    <p>The men were al­ready the tar­gets of crim­i­nal cases over ter­ror­ism of­fences, Swiss pros­e­cu­tors said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral pros­e­cu­tors opened the cases “in 2018 and 2019, and they are on­go­ing”, the of­fice said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>One of the two men, aged 24, is a de­fen­dant in one of the cases, while the other, aged 18, is stand­ing trial as a mi­nor.</p>
    <p>Zurich pros­e­cu­tors said the teenager, cur­rently “in cus­tody”, was known to their col­leagues in nearby Win­terthur who “have been deal­ing with the rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion phe­nom­e­non for sev­eral years”.</p>
    <p>Mr Ruf said Aus­tria was in con­tact with Switzer­land and an­other coun­try that he de­clined to iden­tify over the in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>North Mace­do­nia on Tues­day said three peo­ple were some­how in­volved in the at­tack and all had dual Aus­trian and North Mace­do­nian cit­i­zen­ship. It iden­ti­fied them only by ini­tials.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, Aus­trian Chan­cel­lor Se­bas­tian Kurz’s of­fice said Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron of France, which has suf­fered two re­cent deadly at­tacks amid Is­lamist anger over the pub­li­ca­tion of satir­i­cal car­i­ca­tures of Prophet Muham­mad, would take part in “a video con­fer­ence at the be­gin­ning of the week on the fight against Is­lamic ter­ror­ism and po­lit­i­cal Is­lam”.</p>
