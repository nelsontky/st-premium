    <p>GENEVA/BEIJING The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) is work­ing with China on re­quire­ments for in­ter­na­tional ap­proval of any Chi­nese Covid-19 vac­cine, a se­nior WHO of­fi­cial has said.</p>
    <p>“WHO’s of­fice in China and WHO head­quar­ters have been work­ing with the reg­u­la­tory au­thor­i­ties in China,” as­sis­tant di­rec­tor-gen­eral Mar­i­an­gela Si­mao said on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“We are in di­rect con­tact, we have been shar­ing in­for­ma­tion and the re­quire­ments for in­ter­na­tional ap­proval of vac­cines.”</p>
    <p>Chi­nese firm Si­no­vac Biotech said on Mon­day that its coro­n­avirus vac­cine can­di­date ap­peared to be safe for older peo­ple, ac­cord­ing to pre­lim­i­nary re­sults from an early to mid-stage trial, while the im­mune re­sponses trig­gered by the vac­cine were slightly weaker than those in younger adults.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials have been con­cerned about whether ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cines can pro­tect the el­derly, whose im­mune sys­tems re­act less ro­bustly to vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Si­no­vac’s can­di­date Coron­aVac did not cause se­vere side ef­fects in com­bined phases one and two tri­als launched in May in­volv­ing 421 peo­ple aged at least 60, Si­no­vac’s me­dia rep­re­sen­ta­tive Liu Pe­icheng said. The com­plete re­sults have not been pub­lished.</p>
    <p>Four of the world’s eight vac­cines that are in the third phase of tri­als are from China.</p>
    <p>For three groups of peo­ple who re­spec­tively took two shots of low, medium and high-dose Coron­aVac, more than 90 per cent of them saw sig­nif­i­cant in­creases in an­ti­body lev­els, Mr Liu said. The lev­els were slightly lower than those seen in younger sub­jects but in line with ex­pec­ta­tions, he added.</p>
    <p>Coron­aVac – which is in fi­nal­stage hu­man tri­als in Brazil and In­dia to eval­u­ate if it is safe and ef­fec­tive enough to ob­tain reg­u­la­tory ap­provals for mass use – has al­ready been given to tens of thou­sands of peo­ple, in­clud­ing about 90 per cent of Si­no­vac em­ploy­ees and their fam­i­lies, as part of China’s emer­gency in­oc­u­la­tion scheme.</p>
    <p>The ex­tent of in­oc­u­la­tions un­der the pro­gramme, which China launched in July, points to how ac­tively it is us­ing ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cines in the hopes of pro­tect­ing its es­sen­tial work­ers even as tri­als are still un­der way.</p>
    <p>Mr Liu said the po­ten­tial vac­cine could re­main sta­ble for up to three years in stor­age, which may of­fer Si­no­vac an ad­van­tage in vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion to re­gions where cold­chain stor­age is not an op­tion.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the WHO is in talks with In­dia about join­ing the Covax global vac­cine al­lo­ca­tion plan.</p>
    <p>“In­dia is cer­tainly el­i­gi­ble, like all coun­tries in the world, to be part of the Covax fa­cil­ity and dis­cus­sions are on­go­ing in that re­gard,” Dr Bruce Ayl­ward said on Mon­day. “We would wel­come In­dian par­tic­i­pa­tion... In­dia has ex­ten­sive ex­pe­ri­ence (with vac­cines).”</p>
    <p>The WHO and the Gavi vac­cine al­liance are lead­ing the Covax fa­cil­ity, aimed at help­ing to buy and fairly dis­trib­ute vac­ci­na­tion shots against Covid-19 world­wide. But some coun­tries, like the US, that have se­cured their own sup­plies through bi­lat­eral deals have said they will not join Covax.</p>
