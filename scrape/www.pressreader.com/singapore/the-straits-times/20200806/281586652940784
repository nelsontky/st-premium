    <p>Crim­i­nal de­fence lawyer Charles Yeo has been ap­pointed chair­man of the Re­form Party (RP), while oil and gas com­pany di­rec­tor Ma­ha­boob Batcha is the party’s new trea­surer. RP an­nounced the ap­point­ments in a Face­book post yes­ter­day. It said they were part of party re­newal fol­low­ing the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Crim­i­nal de­fence lawyer Charles Yeo has been ap­pointed chair­man of the Re­form Party (RP), while oil and gas com­pany di­rec­tor Ma­ha­boob Batcha is the new trea­surer.</p>
    <p>The party an­nounced the ap­point­ments in a Face­book post yes­ter­day, which it said were part of party re­newal fol­low­ing the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>But the move has been crit­i­cised by out­go­ing RP chair­man Andy Zhu, who told The Straits Times he was un­fairly dis­missed by the party be­fore al­le­ga­tions made against him by sec­re­tary-gen­eral Ken­neth Je­yaret­nam have been re­solved.</p>
    <p>RP had said in its post that Mr Zhu, 37, and out­go­ing trea­surer No­raini Yunus, 52, will both be step­ping down from its cen­tral ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee (CEC).</p>
    <p>The in­ter­nal con­flict spilled into the open when Mr Zhu made a sub­se­quent post yes­ter­day us­ing the party’s Face­book ac­count that said: “This is an un­demo­cratic stance by the SG Ken­neth Je­yaret­nam to make this an­nounce­ment of new ap­point­ments while the mat­ters and al­le­ga­tions against the party chair and trea­surer are not fi­nalised.”</p>
    <p>The post, which was taken down, said the party should not make any new ap­point­ments till the CEC fin­ishes de­lib­er­at­ing on the is­sues and makes a de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhu told ST: “This is some­thing like an un­fair dis­missal... I have re­futed all the al­le­ga­tions against me.”</p>
    <p>He said Mr Je­yaret­nam, 61, had lev­elled var­i­ous al­le­ga­tions against him af­ter the GE, chief of which was that he made changes to RP’s pay­ment meth­ods with­out of­fi­cial party ap­proval. The party’s rules re­quire all cheques for pay­ments to be signed by the trea­surer and one other CEC mem­ber.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhu said he had ap­plied for PayNow and re­ac­ti­vated the party’s on­line bank­ing ac­count be­cause of the need to make full pay­ment quickly to con­trac­tors for ser­vices such as print­ing posters and dis­tribut­ing fliers.</p>
    <p>“I con­veyed this to the group chat and ev­ery­one agreed that we should get PayNow and on­line bank­ing... But (Mr Je­yaret­nam) is now claim­ing ig­no­rance,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhu said Mr Je­yaret­nam then ac­cused him of mak­ing pay­ments to con­trac­tors us­ing the wrong chan­nels, in­stead of by cheque.</p>
    <p>“Ken­neth said that large amounts of funds can be trans­ferred out as there are no dual sig­na­to­ries. I told him I did not mis­use the funds and we couldn’t wait for the cheques to clear be­fore paying the con­trac­tors. The trea­surer was aware of any money go­ing in and out,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that Mr Je­yaret­nam sus­pended him and Ms No­raini af­ter the gen­eral elec­tion, and claimed the en­tire CEC had agreed to it – a point that he dis­puted.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhu said he was not chal­leng­ing Mr Yeo’s ap­point­ment as chair­man, but the man­ner in which Mr Je­yaret­nam was forc­ing him out.</p>
    <p>Mr Je­yaret­nam told ST that RP had held an in­quiry, where Mr Zhu and Ms No­raini pre­sented their case. The CEC then de­cided at a meet­ing on Mon­day to re­move them from their posts, af­ter con­sid­er­ing the ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>“We made it clear that we are hav­ing a re­view of the 2020 GE and as part of that, we are iden­ti­fy­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties and look­ing at weak­nesses. Their re­movals have come in light of the re­view, as we’ve de­cided to re­place the lead­er­ship based on ini­tial find­ings on where we have had short­com­ings,” he said.</p>
    <p>“They still have the chance to ap­peal and un­til the process is com­pleted, I don’t think I can make any fur­ther com­ments.”</p>
    <p>Mr Je­yaret­nam also said the party se­lected Mr Yeo, 30, as its new chair­man be­cause “we are re­new­ing our ranks and iden­ti­fy­ing new lead­ers and Charles clearly is an out­stand­ing can­di­date”.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo had drawn at­ten­tion dur­ing the elec­tion cam­paign af­ter clips of him strug­gling to de­liver the Man­darin con­stituency po­lit­i­cal broad­cast speech for his party went vi­ral on­line.</p>
    <p>Mr Ma­ha­boob was for­merly RP’s deputy trea­surer. He was un­veiled as a can­di­date ahead of the GE, but did not con­test.</p>
