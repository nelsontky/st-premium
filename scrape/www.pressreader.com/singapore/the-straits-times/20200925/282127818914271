    <p>A col­lec­tion of 10 essays ex­am­in­ing re­li­gion as a force for peace and so­cial co­he­sion was launched by the In­ter-Reli­gious Or­gan­i­sa­tion (IRO) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ti­tled Re­li­gions For Peace And Har­mony, the book ar­gues against ex­ploit­ing re­li­gion to in­cite strife and vi­o­lence around the world.</p>
    <p>“Sadly, con­flicts around the world have por­trayed re­li­gions un­favourably. We hope that by read­ing the book, peo­ple can see that all the re­li­gions pro­fess a com­mon en­deav­our for har­mo­nious co­ex­is­tence,” said Mr Tan Thiam Lye, who is pres­i­dent of the IRO and the Sin­ga­pore Taoist Fed­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“We have made sig­nif­i­cant ef­forts to en­sure that the book is an easy read for ev­ery­one, while at the same time, con­vey­ing the prin­ci­ples of peace­mak­ing in world re­li­gions,” he added.</p>
    <p>The vir­tual book launch com­mem­o­rated In­ter­na­tional Day of Peace that fell on Mon­day. The event was wit­nessed by 120 guests world­wide, in­clud­ing in Al­ba­nia, In­done­sia, Is­rael and the United States.</p>
    <p>Also present was Emer­i­tus Se­nior Min­is­ter Goh Chok Tong, who is the IRO’s pa­tron. “We are now in an age where many global forces are cen­trifu­gal; they pull us apart,” he said. “The IRO must be a coun­ter­vail­ing cen­tripetal force to bring all of us closer to­gether. The greater the threat of di­vi­sive­ness, the more in­clu­sive the IRO should be.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tan added that the IRO felt the need to pub­lish a book that pur­sues a faith-based ap­proach to so­cial co­he­sion, as the world tack­les the rise of ex­trem­ism and hate crimes.</p>
    <p>“Sadly, con­flicts around the world have por­trayed re­li­gions un­favourably. The younger gen­er­a­tion sees re­li­gion on the flip side of so­cial har­mony and ques­tions the role of re­li­gion in cre­at­ing a united world,” he said.</p>
    <p>The IRO was formed in 1949 to pro­mote peace and har­mony among fol­low­ers of the dif­fer­ent re­li­gions. In it, 10 faiths are rep­re­sented: the Baha’i faith, Bud­dhism, Chris­tian­ity, Hin­duism, Is­lam, Jain­ism, Ju­daism, Sikhism, Tao­ism and Zoroas­tri­an­ism.</p>
    <p>It has pub­lished var­i­ous other books, in­clud­ing Reli­gious Cus­toms And Prac­tices In Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s book launch fea­tured two guest speak­ers: Rabbi David Rosen, who is in­ter­na­tional direc­tor of in­ter-reli­gious af­fairs at the Amer­i­can Jewish Com­mit­tee, and Mr Alexan­der Charles Louis, pres­i­dent of the United Na­tions As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr Louis spoke about the UN’s role in shap­ing peace and fos­ter­ing di­a­logue, while Rabbi Rosen stressed the im­por­tance of in­ter-faith col­lab­o­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>“It is all about ac­cept­ing dif­fer­ences and hav­ing the abil­ity to lis­ten to, recog­nise, re­spect and ap­pre­ci­ate oth­ers,” Mr Louis said, adding that the UN and its agen­cies are striv­ing to pro­vide peo­ple with the means to achieve peace.</p>
    <p>Rabbi Rosen added that one of the key mo­ti­va­tions for in­ter-reli­gious en­gage­ment is the recog­ni­tion that all re­li­gions share cer­tain com­mon val­ues.</p>
    <p>“We have an obli­ga­tion to be greater than the sum of our dif­fer­ent parts.</p>
    <p>“We have a re­spon­si­bil­ity within all our reli­gious tra­di­tions to work to­gether with those who share those val­ues, be­cause if we don’t do so, in a way, we are be­tray­ing those val­ues,” he said.</p>
