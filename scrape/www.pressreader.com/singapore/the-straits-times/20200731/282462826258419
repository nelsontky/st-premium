    <p>Late af­ter­noon, a se­cret lo­ca­tion in Italy. You’re sit­ting in the pi­azza, sip­ping a spritz. There is not one tourist in sight. No teem­ing hordes from cruise ships. You look up at the sky. It is tinged with pink. A cou­ple of nib­bles, lazy con­ver­sa­tion. A sigh of con­tent­ment es­capes your lips.</p>
    <p>Then comes an­other sigh. Not of con­tent­ment.</p>
    <p>Be­cause that right there is an out­ra­geous fan­tasy. No­body is go­ing any­where, for now. But when I want to pre­tend that I am any­where but here, I’ll head to Bar Mi­lano, newly opened on Keong Saik Road. Yes, Keong Saik Road needs an­other wa­ter­ing hole. But only if it’s this place.</p>
    <p>The 38-seat all-day, in­door bar opened on July 8, but the look and feel of the in­te­rior sug­gest it has been here for­ever. Food of­fer­ings scrawled on mir­rors, old-school lamps. Those plates, with de­lib­er­ately faded pat­terns. The vibe is some­where in be­tween the high gloss of Cova in Mi­lan, and that neigh­bour­hood hang­out in your se­cret happy place.</p>
    <p>The food and drinks are ter­rific and, maybe, you will want to stay and can­cel that din­ner book­ing you made nearby.</p>
    <p>From the Spritz Bar, or­der the Bianco ($20), with Coc­chi Amer­i­cano, pros­ecco and basil. On a warm evening here, noth­ing is bet­ter. Ex­cept, per­haps, the Lam­br­usco</p>
    <p>($20), that very di­vi­sive red wine mixed with house­made cherry syrup and Man­cino Chi­nato.</p>
    <p>I could skirt around the main cour­ses and nib­ble all night.</p>
    <p>Must orders in­clude Olives As­colana ($10), which I thought was avail­able only in one Ital­ian restau­rant in all of Sin­ga­pore. It’s a spe­cialty of As­coli Pi­ceno in Cen­tral Italy. Big green olives are spi­ral cut to re­move the pits and then stuffed, breaded and deep fried. The fill­ing here is pork. I find the ar­mour a lit­tle more crunchy than it would be in Italy, but I will not quib­ble.</p>
    <p>Steak Tartare ($18, above), piled on sour­dough toast, is full of umami from an­chovy cream. I’ll have an­other or­der, please.</p>
    <p>Save some room for dessert. There is a ter­rific Carrot & Wal­nut cake ($10) with a layer of mas­car­pone cheese in it. It re­minds me of the jaw-drop­ping se­lec­tion of cake at an Ital­ian break­fast buf­fet. I love how the wal­nuts are prop­erly toasted and how the cheese com­ple­ments the slightly dry crumb of the cake.</p>
    <p>And then be­cause you can, or­der a Spiked Frap­puc­cino ($20) as a night cap. Cof­fee, spiced rum, cof­fee liqueur and vanilla syrup are blended to­gether and topped with whipped cream.</p>
    <p>I slept like a baby after din­ner at</p>
    <p>Bar Mi­lano. And I dreamt beau­ti­ful dreams of Italy. Ci ve­di­amo.</p>
    <p>WHERE: Bar Mi­lano, 55 Keong Saik Road, 01-02 MRT: Ou­tram</p>
    <p>OPEN: 10am to mid­night daily</p>
