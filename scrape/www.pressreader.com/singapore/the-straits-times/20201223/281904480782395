    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has pub­lished a list of Chi­nese and Rus­sian com­pa­nies with al­leged mil­i­tary ties that re­strict them from buy­ing a wide range of Amer­i­can goods and tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>It was re­ported last month that the US Depart­ment of Com­merce had drafted a list of com­pa­nies that it linked to the Chi­nese or Rus­sian mil­i­tary, news that brought a re­buke from Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal list on Mon­day does not in­clude Com­mer­cial Air­craft Cor­po­ra­tion of China (Co­mac), or the Hong Kong sub­sidiaries of Colorado’s Ar­row Elec­tron­ics and Texas-based TTI Inc, a Berk­shire Hath­away elec­tron­ics dis­trib­u­tor. Those com­pa­nies were on the draft list seen by Reuters.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Shang­hai Air­craft De­sign and Re­search In­sti­tute, which de­signs Co­mac planes, and Shang­hai Air­craft Man­u­fac­tur­ing Co, which makes Co­mac planes, are on the list.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal list names 103 en­ti­ties, 14 fewer than on the draft list seen by Reuters in Novem­ber. Fiftyeight are des­ig­nated un­der China, down from 89, and 45 en­ti­ties are tied to Rus­sia, up from 28.</p>
    <p>Com­merce Sec­re­tary Wil­bur Ross said on Mon­day that the ac­tion es­tab­lishes a new process “to as­sist ex­porters in screen­ing their cus­tomers for mil­i­tary end users”.</p>
    <p>The pub­li­ca­tion of the list in the wan­ing days of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion fol­lows the ad­di­tion of dozens of Chi­nese firms to an­other US trade black­list, in­clud­ing the coun­try’s t op chip­maker, SMIC, and drone man­u­fac­turer SZ DJI Tech­nol­ogy, on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The US gov­ern­ment also has grown in­creas­ingly con­cerned about China’s “mil­i­tary-civil fu­sion”, a pol­icy that aims to build up its mil­i­tary might and tech­no­log­i­cal devel­op­ment in tan­dem.</p>
    <p>The Com­merce Depart­ment ear­lier this year ex­panded the def­i­ni­tion of “mil­i­tary end users”, as the depart­ment de­fines the com­pa­nies with mil­i­tary ties.</p>
    <p>The cat­e­gory in­cludes not only armed ser­vice and na­tional po­lice, but any per­son or en­tity that sup­ports or con­trib­utes to the main­te­nance or production of mil­i­tary items – even if their busi­ness is pri­mar­ily non-mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>The “mil­i­tary end user” des­ig­na­tion re­quires US com­pa­nies to ob­tain li­cences to sell to the firms, which are more likely to be de­nied than granted.</p>
    <p>The list is not de­fin­i­tive and Com­merce said US com­pa­nies must con­tinue to do their own due dili­gence to help de­cide whether their buy­ers are con­sid­ered mil­i­tary end users.</p>
    <p>Pub­li­ca­tion of the list is likely to anger China. Its for­eign min­istry spokesman, Zhao Li­jian had, in Novem­ber, called news of the draft list “un­pro­voked sup­pres­sion of Chi­nese com­pa­nies by the United States”.</p>
