    <p>SYD­NEY Aus­tralia yes­ter­day re­ported its small­est daily in­crease in new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions in more than three months, but the au­thor­i­ties in the na­tion’s virus hot spot of Vic­to­ria said they could not has­ten the eas­ing of curbs.</p>
    <p>The 16 new cases are Aus­tralia’s small­est daily jump since June 14. There were also two more deaths.</p>
    <p>“This light at the end of the tun­nel is get­ting closer ev­ery day,” deputy chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer Nick Coatsworth told re­porters in the cap­i­tal Canberra.</p>
    <p>The bulk of the new cases once again came from south-east­ern Vic­to­ria state, the epi­cen­tre of Aus­tralia’s sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions, where 11 peo­ple tested pos­i­tive over the last day, down from a daily record of 725 early last month.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it was too soon to has­ten the timetable for re­mov­ing curbs, said Vic­to­ria Premier Daniel Andrews. “If cir­cum­stances change, if we find our­selves ahead of sched­ule, not for one day, but in a man­i­fest sense, com­mon sense al­ways guides us,” he told re­porters in the state cap­i­tal of Mel­bourne.</p>
    <p>Nightly cur­fews are among the mea­sures im­posed on the city in one of the world’s tough­est lock­downs, but state of­fi­cials have said that build­ing sites, man­u­fac­tur­ing plants, ware­houses and child­care fa­cil­i­ties can re­open next Mon­day if the two-week av­er­age num­ber of new cases re­mains be­low 50. Now it is be­low 35.</p>
    <p>The bulk of Vic­to­ria’s re­stric­tions could be lifted late next month if its two-week av­er­age stays be­low five,</p>
    <p>a target which Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son has crit­i­cised as too puni­tive and costly to the na­tional econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia is bat­tling its first re­ces­sion in 30 years, while un­em­ploy­ment in July hit a 22-year high as virus curbs paral­ysed busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>The Vic­to­ria out­break has also closed off prospects that travel be</p>
    <p>tween Aus­tralia and New Zealand could re­sume soon.</p>
    <p>But the Vic­to­ria curbs have pre­vented a sec­ond wave of na­tional in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria has con­trib­uted al­most 75 per cent of Aus­tralia’s tally of nearly 27,000 in­fec­tions and roughly 90 per cent of its 851 deaths.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Mor­ri­son’s ap­proval rat­ing has risen slightly, a poll showed yes­ter­day, as mea­sures by the Con­ser­va­tive gov­ern­ment to tackle the pan­demic helped to main­tain his pop­u­lar­ity.</p>
    <p>A Newspoll survey con­ducted for The Aus­tralian news­pa­per showed Mr Mor­ri­son’s per­for­mance rat­ing rose a per­cent­age point to 65 per</p>
    <p>cent from a month ear­lier, just short of the highs of 68 per cent in June and July.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son also re­cov­ered ground as the pre­ferred prime min­is­ter af­ter a dip in the pre­vi­ous poll, with the num­ber of peo­ple sup­port­ing him nudg­ing a point higher to 59 per cent, the poll showed.</p>
