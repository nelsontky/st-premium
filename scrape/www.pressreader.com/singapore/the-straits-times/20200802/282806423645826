    <p>Maleeha Lodhi Dawn, Pak­istan</p>
    <p>The out­come of the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in Novem­ber will have a sig­nif­i­cant global im­pact. Will it mean more of the same or usher in changes in Amer­i­can for­eign pol­icy? With the elec­tion just over three months away, Demo­cratic con­tender Joe Bi­den has a two-digit lead over Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, whose ap­proval rat­ings have plum­meted due to his mis­han­dling of the coron­avirus pan­demic and a weak­en­ing econ­omy.</p>
    <p>This lead will likely nar­row as the cam­paign ad­vances with the race ex­pected to be close. An un­usual elec­tion in the midst of the pan­demic means greater un­pre­dictabil­ity, es­pe­cially in view of Mr Trump’s ef­forts to set the stage to chal­lenge and dele­git­imise the out­come if he loses.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s di­vi­sive and com­bat­ive lead­er­ship and his con­tro­ver­sial poli­cies on race and polic­ing have left his country in a state of dis­ar­ray, di­vi­sion and dys­func­tion. This has dam­aged Amer­ica’s rep­u­ta­tion and global stand­ing and eroded its soft power – weak­nesses that will be re­in­forced if he is re-elected.</p>
    <p>A Bi­den pres­i­dency will seek to heal these in­ter­nal di­vi­sions and try to re­verse its dele­te­ri­ous fall­out on Amer­ica’s global image. That would rep­re­sent the first fun­da­men­tal dif­fer­ence be­tween them.</p>
    <p>Their gen­eral ap­proach to for­eign pol­icy will also be ap­pre­cia­bly dif­fer­ent. Mr Bi­den’s will be more con­ven­tional and pre­dictable in sharp con­trast to Mr Trump’s whim­si­cal and dis­rup­tive han­dling of global af­fairs, which will re­main his style of con­duct­ing for­eign re­la­tions if re-elected.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump can be ex­pected to con­tinue his “Amer­ica First” uni­lat­eral pol­icy, re­ject­ing mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism, aban­don­ing more in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions or agree­ments, show­ing dis­dain for tra­di­tional al­liances in­clud­ing Nato and dis­re­gard­ing al­lies on key fronts.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, on the other hand, has long dealt with for­eign pol­icy and de­fines him­self as a “lib­eral in­ter­na­tion­al­ist”. He will seek to re­vive Amer­ica’s mul­ti­lat­eral cre­den­tials, re­join global bod­ies, re­store part­ner­ships in Europe and Asia, re­pair ties with al­lies and</p>
    <p>In ret­ro­spect, Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte’s fifth State of the Na­tion Ad­dress will likely be his most im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>More than ever, the ques­tion of suc­ces­sion looms over the hori­zon, as the Pres­i­dent grap­ples with what has be­come among the worst epi­demic out­breaks and eco­nomic crises in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>In just over a year from now, the next pres­i­den­tial cam­paign will ef­fec­tively com­mence.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of top con­tenders, es­pe­cially Sen­a­tor Manny Pac­quiao, have al­ready sig­nalled their in­ten­tions.</p>
    <p>Qui­etly help­ing front-lin­ers and the worst-af­fected com­mu­ni­ties on the ground, Vice-Pres­i­dent Leni Ro­bredo is gain­ing mo­men­tum while weigh­ing her op­tions.</p>
    <p>The ul­ti­mate dark horse, how­ever, is Manila Mayor Isko strengthen Nato, as a long-time sup­porter of the al­liance.</p>
    <p>On the world’s most crit­i­cal bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship – be­tween the US and China – Mr Trump would, if re-elected, likely con­tinue on a course of con­fronta­tion mak­ing fu­ture ties tur­bu­lent and marked by more provoca­tive ac­tions. He will try to re­fash­ion the trade equa­tion be­tween the two global pow­ers, but in the face of a more con­fi­dent and as­sertive China. The anti-China mood in the US will be re­in­forced dur­ing the cam­paign as both can­di­dates por­tray them­selves as tough on China. The two camps are al­ready ac­cus­ing each other of be­ing soft on Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>As the pop­u­lar and po­lit­i­cal con­sen­sus in Amer­ica now sees China as a ma­nip­u­la­tive ad­ver­sary, this will also shape Mr Bi­den’s pol­icy ap­proach. Most of his for­eign pol­icy ad­vis­ers are hawks on China. Nev­er­the­less, while adopt­ing a tough stance to­wards Bei­jing and en­gag­ing in strate­gic com­pe­ti­tion as well as con­tain­ment, Mr Bi­den may be less com­bat­ive than Mr Trump and seek ar­eas of co­op­er­a­tion such as cli­mate change and North Korea. He may also try to re­vive the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship.</p>
    <p>On Afghanista­n, Mr Trump has made plain he in­tends to with­draw all US mil­i­tary forces as com­mit­ted un­der the Doha deal be­tween the US and the Tale­ban. Mr Bi­den is un­likely to shift course on this.</p>
    <p>South Asia is not ex­pected to be a high pri­or­ity for ei­ther of the two,</p>
    <p>Moreno, the hottest po­lit­i­cal fig­ure in town.</p>
    <p>He faces a sim­i­lar quandary as Sen­a­tor Grace Poe in 2016.</p>
    <p>If he stays longer in Manila’s byzan­tine pol­i­tics, he risks los­ing mo­men­tum. But if he is per­ceived to be run­ning for the high­est of­fice too soon, he may peak too early.</p>
    <p>The stakes are too high to ig­nore. Per­haps more than any country, the suc­ces­sion ques­tion is of im­mense im­por­tance to Filipino pres­i­dents.</p>
    <p>On the one hand, they are con­strained by only a sin­gle term in of­fice, un­der­cut­ting their abil­ity to sus­tain long-term-ori­ented re­forms.</p>
    <p>In a country with no real po­lit­i­cal par­ties, personal bonds are of­ten the best in­di­ca­tions of pol­icy di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>Re­formist pres­i­dents Fidel Ramos and Benigno Aquino III painfully grap­pled with this dilemma, as pop­ulist suc­ces­sors re­versed much of their lib­eral demo­cratic gains.</p>
    <p>One could just imag­ine the Philip­pines’ al­ter­na­tive tra­jec­tory had Mr Ramos and Mr Aquino been able to sus­tain their re­forms through re­li­able suc­ces­sors.</p>
    <p>More­over, sim­i­lar to the United but both are likely to strengthen ties with In­dia to balance China.</p>
    <p>Ra­mon Farolan Philip­pine Daily Inquirer, Philip­pines</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump is run­ning for re-elec­tion against Demo­cratic op­po­nent Joe Bi­den. With­out the coron­avirus pan­demic, the Trump re-elec­tion bid ap­peared solid with a strong US econ­omy and un­em­ploy­ment fig­ures at an all-time low.</p>
    <p>But the pan­demic has al­tered the pic­ture, with Amer­i­cans dis­ap­prov­ing of how he has han­dled the health cri­sis. As a re­sult, 15 weeks before elec­tion time, most polls put Mr Bi­den ahead with dou­ble-digit leads.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump needs a new cam­paign is­sue. He is los­ing on the do­mes­tic front – plung­ing econ­omy, in­creas­ing un­em­ploy­ment, di­vi­sive rhetoric, ris­ing Covid-19 cases and deaths, with ap­par­ently no na­tional strat­egy to com­bat the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>His kick-off cam­paign rally in Tulsa, Ok­la­homa, was at­tended by a sparse crowd in a half-empty arena. His cam­paign man­ager got fired over this dis­as­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump is now fo­cus­ing at­ten­tion on the South China Sea dis­pute. He has got the Philip­pine gov­ern­ment to sus­pend the ter­mi­na­tion of the Vis­it­ing Forces</p>
    <p>States, there is a strong anti-in­cum­bency bias through­out elec­tion cy­cles.</p>
    <p>In Amer­ica’s case, this tends to hap­pen after eight years of rule un­der a sin­gle party or suc­ces­sively elected pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Even when faced with less than stel­lar Repub­li­can chal­lengers, rel­a­tively pop­u­lar Demo­cratic pres­i­dents like Mr Bill Clin­ton and Mr Barack Obama failed to en­sure their pre­ferred suc­ces­sors’ vic­tory.</p>
    <p>Third, and most cru­cially, the Philip­pines is eerily sim­i­lar to South Korea when it comes to the cruel fate of for­mer pres­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Since their tran­si­tion to democ­racy, South Kore­ans have forced sev­eral pres­i­dents ei­ther into jail, sui­cide or even im­peach­ment over al­le­ga­tions of cor­rup­tion and abuse of power.</p>
    <p>How­ever, though our demo­cratic ex­pe­ri­ence ex­ceeds South Korea’s in tem­po­ral terms, our in­sti­tu­tional checks and bal­ances have proven far less ma­ture.</p>
    <p>The suc­cess of the Edsa I and Edsa II “peo­ple power” re­volts was de­ter­mined less by ju­di­cial ac­count­abil­ity than by the mil­i­tary’s with­drawal of</p>
    <p>Agree­ment that was to end this month, 180 days after no­tice of ter­mi­na­tion was given. Of course, our sen­a­tor got back his US visa.</p>
    <p>The air­craft car­rier USS Ron­ald Rea­gan is car­ry­ing out drills with naval forces of Ja­pan and Aus­tralia in Philip­pine wa­ters, rais­ing ten­sions in the re­gion. US navy ves­sels are fre­quently sail­ing close to Chi­nese-oc­cu­pied is­lands in the Spratlys. Any slight mis­cal­cu­la­tion can trig­ger a shoot­ing in­ci­dent that may lead to only God knows where.</p>
    <p>Dr Mary Trump, daugh­ter of Mr Trump’s old­est brother, re­cently came out with a book on her un­cle Too Much And Never Enough – How My Fam­ily Cre­ated The World’s Most Dan­ger­ous Man.</p>
    <p>We live in dan­ger­ous times.</p>
    <p>Azhar Azam</p>
    <p>China Daily, China</p>
    <p>The Novem­ber 2020 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in the US would be a cesspool of con­tro­ver­sies, in­clud­ing al­le­ga­tions and counter-al­le­ga­tions, racism and big­otry with the Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump in­di­cat­ing that he might re­ject the re­sults if pre­sump­tive Demo­cratic nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den wins.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, who overly played down the threat of Covid-19 and is yet to come up with a pub­lic health strat­egy to con­tain the spread of in­sti­tu­tional support from dis­graced pres­i­dents.</p>
    <p>None­the­less, the past two decades have seen a re­li­able pat­tern of po­lit­i­cal per­se­cu­tion against for­mer pres­i­dents, with one tem­po­rar­ily end­ing up in jail for plun­der and another con­fined to a years-long de facto house ar­rest.</p>
    <p>As for the third one, he was sub­jected to noth­ing less than leg­isla­tive ha­rass­ment by overnight anti-vaxxers, while con­stantly grap­pling with the spec­tre of more vi­cious forms of po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated per­se­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing alien­ated pow­er­ful the dis­ease, re­sisted the ar­gu­ment that the US has the sev­enth-largest mor­tal­ity rate in the world and skirted tak­ing re­spon­si­bil­ity for the dra­matic surge in in­fected pa­tients, pass­ing the buck to the vet­eran US doc­tors.</p>
    <p>He also chal­lenged Mr Bi­den’s men­tal sharp­ness, re­it­er­at­ing that if elected, Mr Bi­den would ruin the country and be pushed to the rad­i­cal left.</p>
    <p>The defam­a­tory com­ment “Joe doesn’t know he’s alive” was just a drop in the bucket in Mr Trump’s im­pe­ri­ous ap­proach to­wards his op­po­nent and a play­back of his ag­gres­sive for­eign pol­icy that bul­lies the US in­ter­na­tional re­la­tion­ship and trade sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s fus­tian fol­low­ing the low turnout at his elec­tion ral­lies and dip­ping ap­proval in­creases the risk of a night­mare sce­nario if he is voted out by pub­lic bal­lot.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Larry Di­a­mond, a senior fel­low at the con­ser­va­tive-lean­ing Hoover In­sti­tu­tion and the Free­man Spogli In­sti­tute for In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies (FSI) at Stan­ford Uni­ver­sity – along­side nearly 20 ex­perts, po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tists, for­mer law­mak­ers and his­to­ri­ans – cau­tioned that there was “sig­nif­i­cant scope” of un­prece­dented cri­sis after the US wraps up the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion at the end of the year.</p>
    <p>As many states are not ready to host ab­sen­tee vot­ing, and some, like New York and Ken­tucky, took longer than a week to de­clare el­e­ments across the world, Pres­i­dent Duterte faces an even more acute dilemma.</p>
    <p>Al­le­ga­tions of wide­spread hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions could even por­tend full-fledged In­ter­na­tional Crim­i­nal Court pros­e­cu­tion and personal sanc­tions by ma­jor coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Bar­ring an 11th-hour con­sti­tu­tional over­haul, a “nu­clear op­tion” that con­stantly lurks in the shad­ows, Mr Duterte’s best hope to avoid the fate of his pre­de­ces­sors is to en­sure a friendly, if not sub­servient, suc­ces­sor.</p>
    <p>Davao’s youth­ful and charis­matic Mayor Sara Duterte has seemed the re­cent con­gres­sional primary win­ners, the po­lit­i­cal un­cer­tainty in the US is set to eclipse all pre­vi­ous grim records.</p>
    <p>The “deep scep­ti­cism and con­cern across the po­lit­i­cal spec­trum” could im­pinge on the eco­nomic for­tune of mil­lions of Amer­i­cans who have been tricked by Mr Trump’s non­sen­si­cal eco­nomic, trade and for­eign poli­cies and are be­ing bull­dozed by his hor­ri­ble virus preven­tion and con­trol blun­ders.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, if Mr Trump grabs another term, it won’t be easy for the US to pre­vent a turn­down from Demo­crat par­ti­sans who are still try­ing to bind their wounds after the 2016 de­feat.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts told CNN that if Mr Trump wins, there is se­ri­ous po­ten­tial for civil un­rest that could over­shadow the large and some­times vi­o­lent protests that oc­curred after his 2016 win.</p>
    <p>With Mr Trump sig­nalling that he would not give up and the Democrats am­bi­tious to se­cure a ticket to the ex­ec­u­tive man­sion, the US po­lit­i­cal sys­tem is put to a test.</p>
    <p>Bhopin­der Singh</p>
    <p>The States­man, In­dia</p>
    <p>In less than four months, the 59th qua­dren­nial elec­tions for the still-most-pow­er­ful of­fice in the world – that of the pres­i­dent of the United States – takes place. While In­dian Amer­i­cans have tra­di­tion­ally voted for Democrats, 2020 is a dif­fer­ent world, with deeply po­larised stir­rings of “uber-na­tion­al­ism” abound­ing in In­dia which could con­tex­tu­alise Mr Don­ald Trump’s peeves favourably, that is China and Is­lam­o­pho­bia (and by ex­ten­sion, Pak­istan).</p>
    <p>But is that sim­plis­tic logic enough to swing pref­er­ence to­wards Mr Trump by the In­dian Amer­i­cans?</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s flip-flops on</p>
    <p>Pak­istan are not driven through the lens of the frag­ile Indo-Pak dis­trust, but through its own top­i­cal ne­ces­si­ties; there­fore, the nor­mal­is­ing of re­la­tions with Pak­istan and with the Tale­ban to the detri­ment of In­dian in­ter­ests was brazenly uni­lat­eral. If in­deed In­dia has been pro­vided US mil­i­tary hard­ware and tech­nol­ogy, that has been for purely com­mer­cial con­sid­er­a­tions, and con­cerns per­tain­ing to China.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Joe Bi­den is a prod­uct of the Demo­crat school that is fun­da­men­tally more re­strained, in­clu­sive and in­ter­na­tion­al­ist. Mr Bi­den has a more in­ci­sive take on the sub­con­ti­nent and, as a Demo­crat, he had voted in favour of the land­mark civil­ian nu­clear deal that al­tered Indo-US ties for pos­ter­ity.</p>
    <p>From the H1B visa per­spec­tive, Mr Bi­den is com­mit­ted to a more im­mi­grant-friendly ap­proach. Mr Bi­den will be more pre­dictable and rea­son­able on In­dia’s strate­gic con­cerns, like af­ford­ing more space to man­age its re­gional as­pi­ra­tions with Iran, un­like Mr Trump’s blan­ket in­tran­si­gence de­spite In­dia’s protes­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>As far as China and Pak­istan are con­cerned, the nat­u­ral pref­er­ence to­wards the “pivot” of In­dia can­not change, ir­re­spec­tive of the White House in­cum­bent. most vi­able con­tender to suc­ceed her fa­ther. Her un­will­ing­ness to con­test what would have been a cru­cial and rel­a­tively smooth Se­nate run last year re­vealed the Mayor’s likely al­ter­na­tive plans.</p>
    <p>But so far, it looks like the pres­i­den­tial daugh­ter is far more fo­cused on con­sol­i­dat­ing the “Solid South” bloc, which did re­mark­ably well dur­ing the 2019 elec­tions.</p>
    <p>And this brings us to the ever-loyal con­sigliere and now Sen­a­tor Bong Go, who had a solid per­for­mance in the 2019 elec­tions.</p>
    <p>De­fy­ing his de­trac­tors, the pres­i­den­tial aide got as many as 20 mil­lion votes last year, un­der­scor­ing his po­lit­i­cal dy­namism and in­dis­pens­abil­ity to the Duterte ad­min­is­tra­tion’s day-to-day op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Among pun­dits, he is seen as the de facto heir ap­par­ent.</p>
    <p>It goes with­out say­ing, how­ever, that Mr Duterte’s abil­ity to shape the post-2022 land­scape will de­pend much on the state of his po­lit­i­cal cap­i­tal in the com­ing months. The de­ci­sive fac­tor is re­gain­ing pub­lic trust over his cri­sis man­age­ment per­for­mance, now un­der with­er­ing pub­lic scru­tiny.</p>
