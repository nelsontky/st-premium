    <p>Earth is a wa­ter world, but more is known about the Moon than the depths of our oceans.</p>
    <p>In 2018, how­ever, parts of the In­dian Ocean gave up some of its se­crets to sci­en­tists from In­done­sia and the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) on a deep sea ex­pe­di­tion cruise off the south­ern coast of West Java prov­ince, In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>At the start of this year, the sci­en­tists be­gan telling the world about what they un­cov­ered, with the pub­li­ca­tion of a slew of sci­en­tific pa­pers de­scrib­ing the strange crea­tures dredged up from the seabed, 200m to 2,100m be­neath the sur­face of the ocean.</p>
    <p>One crea­ture, in par­tic­u­lar, cap­tured the world’s at­ten­tion – the Darth Vader iso­pod, a gi­ant deep sea cock­roach so named for its re­sem­blance to the Star Wars vil­lain when viewed head-on. At more than 30cm long, it was ex­cep­tion­ally large for an iso­pod, as most are usu­ally just a few cen­time­tres long.</p>
    <p>Mr Muham­mad Dzaki Sa­faruan, a spe­cial­ist as­so­ciate from Sin­ga­pore’s Lee Kong Chian Nat­u­ral His­tory Mu­seum and an ex­pe­di­tion crew mem­ber, told The Straits Times about the time when the crea­ture was first hauled on board.</p>
    <p>“It was cling­ing on the net, and we were all ex­cited be­cause it was one of the big­ger spec­i­mens en­coun­tered so far.”</p>
    <p>Bathyno­mus rak­sasa also turned out to be a species new to science.</p>
    <p>The sci­en­tists on the South Java Deep Sea Bio­di­ver­sity Ex­pe­di­tion col­lected more than 12,000 crea</p>
    <p>Most or­gan­isms of the deep are black, white or translu­cent, help­ing them blend into the dark­ness. Oc­ca­sional pops of colour are red. Sun­light com­prises a full spec­trum of colour, but be­cause red light has the short­est wave­length and is ab­sorbed by sur­face wa­ters, it does not reach the deep. Hence many deep sea an­i­mals can­not see red, said Pro­fes­sor Peter Ng of Lee Kong Chian Nat­u­ral His­tory Mu­seum.</p>
    <p>tures dur­ing their 14-day voy­age.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists are still comb­ing through the spec­i­mens, but find­ing re­searchers with the right ex­per­tise to study the or­gan­isms and hav­ing the time to ac­cu­rately an­a­lyse the spec­i­mens could take years.</p>
    <p>So far, pa­pers de­scrib­ing 10 other species of crabs, prawns, lob­sters, sea stars and fish have been pub­lished, with more to come.</p>
    <p>To the land-bound, the an­i­mals of the deep sea may look strange. In­ter­na­tional head­lines had called the gi­ant deep sea cock­roach the “stuff of night­mares”.</p>
    <p>But the crea­tures’ un­con­ven­tional phys­i­cal at­tributes are what help them adapt to life in the deep – a hos­tile en­vi­ron­ment that is cold and dark and where food is scarce. Or­gan­isms also have to deal with the crush­ing weight of the body of wa­ter above them.</p>
    <p>Sun­light can­not pen­e­trate more than the first 200m of the sea, so there are no plants or phy­to­plank­ton at depth, re­duc­ing the num­ber of her­biv­o­rous marine or­gan­isms that are prey for many oth­ers.</p>
    <p>But the deeper oceans are richer in other forms of nu­tri­tion. For ex­am­ple, marine snow – the sink­ing or­ganic mat­ter from dead or­gan­isms.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­isms like the gi­ant deep sea cock­roach have learnt to cap­i­talise on this re­source in the deep. The crea­ture earned its name from its scav­eng­ing habits, even though it is more closely re­lated to crabs and shrimps.</p>
    <p>“That said, many deep sea an­i­mals are also known to go without food for months or years at a time,” said Pro­fes­sor Peter Ng, head of the nat­u­ral his­tory mu­seum and colead of the ex­pe­di­tion.</p>
    <p>The (largely) monochro­matic life un­der­wa­ter is an­other adap­ta­tion, he said. Since sun­light does not reach the depths of the ocean, there is hardly any need for colour – which land an­i­mals use for pro­tec­tion from the sun, cam­ou­flage or as a sig­nal to oth­ers of their kind, he ex­plained.</p>
    <p>Most or­gan­isms of the deep are black, white or translu­cent, help­ing them blend into the dark­ness. Oc­ca­sional pops of colour are red. Sun­light com­prises a full spec­trum of colour, but be­cause red light has the short­est wave­length and is ab­sorbed by sur­face wa­ters, it does not reach the deep. Hence many deep sea an­i­mals can­not see red, said Prof Ng.</p>
    <p>“Crus­taceans have a nat­u­rally oc­cur­ring pig­ment that makes them red, although they some­times make other pro­teins to make them ap­pear other colours,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But for some deep wa­ter crus­taceans, stay­ing red con­fers them a ben­e­fit of cam­ou­flage, and this means they don’t have to spend ex­tra en­ergy mak­ing other colours.”</p>
    <p>Prof Ng co-led the ex­pe­di­tion with Pro­fes­sor Dwi Listyo Ra­hayu, se­nior re­search sci­en­tist at the In­done­sian In­sti­tute of Sciences’ Re­search Cen­tre for Oceanog­ra­phy. They led an ex­pe­di­tion team of 31 re­searchers and sup­port staff.</p>
    <p>The rich­ness of life in the deep seas may sur­prise some.</p>
    <p>In the 1800s, it was thought that be­cause of the hos­tile en­vi­ron­ments un­der­wa­ter, the abun­dance and va­ri­ety of marine life would de­crease with in­creas­ing depth, the seabed be­ing life­less.</p>
    <p>But in a video call with The Straits Times last week, the two lead sci­en­tists said their ex­pe­ri­ence with other ex­pe­di­tions showed there are many “cool things” to be found deep un­der­wa­ter.</p>
    <p>Prof Ng said: “We were more wor­ried that we would screw up, the nets would turn up­side down, and ev­ery­thing would be ripped up. So that was the big­ger worry – that we could not get the equip­ment work­ing in the proper way.”</p>
    <p>Prof Ra­hayu agreed, point­ing to the choppy con­di­tions of the sea and the un­pre­dictabil­ity of the ter­rain un­der­wa­ter. “Many nets were dam­aged and torn, and in the last few days of our trip, we were down to our last net,” she said.</p>
    <p>Their ex­pe­di­tion cost about $400,000 in all.</p>
    <p>Prof Ng said that with more fish­ing and min­ing com­pa­nies set­ting sights on re­sources on the seabed – whether for man­ganese nod­ules or oil and gas – it is im­por­tant to know about life un­der­wa­ter so that they can be pro­tected should there be any de­vel­op­ment work un­der­wa­ter.</p>
    <p>“But there’s a big­ger pur­pose here,” he said. “We need to know why they’re there, and to en­sure that they sur­vive, even if there is no oil and gas to be mined.”</p>
    <p>He cited the ex­am­ple of the deep sea cock­roach and how it went vi­ral on the In­ter­net. “Is there any eco­nomic value? Ab­so­lutely none. So how do you ex­plain why it be­comes vi­ral? Be­cause it’s a cool an­i­mal.</p>
    <p>“It shows that gen­er­ally, peo­ple are in­ter­ested in an­i­mals as a group, and once we tell them such an an­i­mal ex­ists, peo­ple get ex­cited. And of course, then you can start plan­ning how to con­serve it.”</p>
    <p>With more fish­ing and min­ing com­pa­nies set­ting sights on re­sources on the seabed – whether for man­ganese nod­ules or oil and gas – it is im­por­tant to know about life un­der­wa­ter so that they can be pro­tected should there be any de­vel­op­ment work un­der­wa­ter. “But there’s a big­ger pur­pose here,” said Prof Ng. “We need to know why they’re there, and to en­sure that they sur­vive, even if there is no oil and gas to be mined.”</p>
