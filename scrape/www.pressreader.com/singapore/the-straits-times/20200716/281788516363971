    <p>Tokyo raised its Covid-19 alert to the high­est on a four-tier scale yes­ter­day, as the re­cent surge in in­fec­tions in Ja­pan’s cap­i­tal city be­gan to spill over from nightlife hot spots into other ar­eas.</p>
    <p>The bustling me­trop­o­lis recorded 165 cases yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing 15 work­ers at a con­struc­tion site.</p>
    <p>This was the lat­est clus­ter to emerge, af­ter those in offices, med­i­cal in­sti­tu­tions and child­care cen­tres, as well as a the­atre in Shin­juku where at least 37 cases were de­tected among ac­tors and the­atre­go­ers of a play that starred up-and­com­ing boy­band mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Tokyo Gov­er­nor Yuriko Koike, cit­ing anal­y­sis by ex­perts, yes­ter­day said that in­fec­tions were clearly spread­ing in the city.</p>
    <p>She stressed ut­most vig­i­lance, al­though she de­clined to im­pose new busi­ness clo­sure ad­vi­sories or stay­home re­quests as med­i­cal in­sti­tu­tions were not over­whelmed.</p>
    <p>Un­like in April, at the peak of the out­break, there were just six pa­tients in crit­i­cal con­di­tion. Many of the new pa­tients were mild or asymp­to­matic cases picked up by ag­gres­sive test­ing, she said.</p>
    <p>But this be­lied the fact that the mov­ing av­er­age of daily cases over the past seven days now stands at 186.5 cases, which is far worse than dur­ing a state of emer­gency that lasted from April 7 to May 25.</p>
    <p>Dr No­rio Oma­gari of the Na­tional Cen­tre for Global Health and Medicine in Tokyo said the av­er­age num­ber of un­linked in­fec­tions has dou­bled from last week.</p>
    <p>He has also warned that Tokyo might be on the verge of an ex­plo­sive growth in cases.</p>
    <p>Pre­fec­tures bor­der­ing Tokyo have also seen a rise in daily cases, with the 41 in­fec­tions yes­ter­day in Kana­gawa, south of the cap­i­tal, the high­est fig­ure since April 18.</p>
    <p>Else­where, Osaka, which has de­clared its own “Yel­low Alert”, saw 61 cases yes­ter­day – the high­est fig­ure since April 20.</p>
    <p>There was shock in Ok­i­nawa, too, amid a surge in Covid-19 cases at the United States mil­i­tary bases in the pre­fec­ture – at least 136 in­fec­tions were recorded. De­fence Min­is­ter Taro Kono point­edly said there were “mul­ti­ple is­sues” with how the US was han­dling the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>And com­pli­cat­ing dis­as­ter re­lief ef­forts in Ku­mamoto, where at least 64 peo­ple died from floods and land­slides caused by heavy rain last week, was the fact that a nurse, dis­patched from the city of Taka­matsu in Ka­gawa pre­fec­ture, had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Some 400 med­i­cal re­lief work­ers and evac­uees are con­sid­ered to have been in close con­tact with the male nurse.</p>
    <p>Notwith­stand­ing this, Eco­nomic Re­vi­tal­i­sa­tion Min­is­ter Ya­su­toshi Nishimura told Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day that the gov­ern­ment would push ahead with plans to launch the “Go To” do­mes­tic travel cam­paign next Wed­nes­day, in time for the sum­mer hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter later backpedall­ed fol­low­ing stiff push­back by mu­nic­i­pal and pre­fec­ture lead­ers and op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers, say­ing that a fi­nal de­ci­sion would be made by an ex­pert panel to­day.</p>
    <p>Many have ques­tioned the wis­dom of forg­ing ahead with such a cam­paign when the lid has not been kept on Covid-19, sug­gest­ing a dis­con­nect among na­tional and lo­cal lead­ers as they walk the tightrope be­tween jump­start­ing an econ­omy in re­ces­sion and man­ag­ing health risks.</p>
    <p>Cases linked to Tokyo have been un­cov­ered across the coun­try, in­clud­ing three peo­ple in Nagoya yes­ter­day who had at­tended the Shin­juku the­atre play.</p>
    <p>Chief Cab­i­net Sec­re­tary Yoshi­hide Suga tried to paint the surge in cases as a “Tokyo prob­lem” last week, spark­ing a feud with Ms Koike, who said it was clearly a “na­tional prob­lem” which the “Go To” cam­paign would only ex­ac­er­bate.</p>
    <p>“It’s like turn­ing on the heater and air-con­di­tioner at the same time,” she said.</p>
    <p>165</p>
    <p>Num­ber of new Covid-19 cases recorded in Tokyo yes­ter­day. 186.5</p>
    <p>Mov­ing av­er­age of daily cases over the past seven days, worse than dur­ing a state of emer­gency that lasted from April 7 to May 25.</p>
