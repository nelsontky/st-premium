    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Top US na­tional se­cu­rity of­fi­cials have agreed on a pro­posed range of op­tions to present to Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump aimed at de­ter­ring any at­tack on US mil­i­tary or diplo­matic per­son­nel in Iraq, a se­nior ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cial told Reuters.</p>
    <p>The meet­ing on Wed­nes­day was spurred by an at­tack on Sun­day in which rock­ets landed in Bagh­dad’s heav­ily for­ti­fied Green Zone com­pound tar­get­ing the United States Em­bassy and caus­ing some mi­nor dam­age, the Iraqi mil­i­tary and the em­bassy said.</p>
    <p>The so-called prin­ci­pals com­mit­tee group, in­clud­ing act­ing De­fence Sec­re­tary Christo­pher Miller, Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo and Na­tional Se­cu­rity Ad­viser Robert O’Brien met at the White House, said the of­fi­cial, who re­quested anonymity.</p>
    <p>A “range of op­tions” would be pre­sented soon to Mr Trump, said the of­fi­cial, who would not de­scribe the con­tent of the op­tions or say whether they in­cluded mil­i­tary ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“Each one is de­signed to be nonesca­la­tory and to de­ter fur­ther at­tack,” the of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the meet­ing, Mr Trump, with­out giv­ing ev­i­dence, said on Twit­ter that the rock­ets on Sun­day were from Iran and “we hear chat­ter of ad­di­tional at­tacks against Amer­i­cans in Iraq”. “Some friendly health ad­vice to Iran: If one Amer­i­can is killed, I will hold Iran re­spon­si­ble. Think it over,” Mr Trump said.</p>
    <p>Iran’s For­eign Min­is­ter yes­ter­day dis­missed Mr Trump’s al­le­ga­tions that Iran was be­hind the rocket at­tack. “Put­ting your own cit­i­zens at risk abroad won’t di­vert at­ten­tion from cat­a­strophic fail­ures at home,” Mr Mo­ham­mad Javad Zarif tweeted.</p>
    <p>The Iraqi mil­i­tary blamed Sun­day’s at­tack on an “out­law group”.</p>
    <p>The US Cen­tral Com­mand said the at­tack was “al­most cer­tainly” con­ducted by an “Ira­nian-backed rogue mili­tia group”.</p>
    <p>“While this 21-rocket at­tack caused no US in­juries or ca­su­al­ties, the at­tack did dam­age build­ings in the US Em­bassy com­pound, and was clearly NOT in­tended to avoid ca­su­al­ties,” it said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Another US of­fi­cial, also speak­ing on the con­di­tion of anonymity, said that af­ter the meet­ing of se­nior lead­ers, the strat­egy was to be vo­cal about Sun­day’s at­tack but there was not a move to­wards us­ing mil­i­tary force. The of­fi­cial added that the cal­cu­lus could change if there were fu­ture at­tacks, es­pe­cially if they harmed Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>In re­cent days, there has been in­creased con­cern and vig­i­lance about what Ira­nian-backed forces might do in the lead-up to the an­niver­sary of the Jan 3 US drone strike in Iraq that killed top Ira­nian gen­eral Qassem Soleimani, the of­fi­cial said.</p>
