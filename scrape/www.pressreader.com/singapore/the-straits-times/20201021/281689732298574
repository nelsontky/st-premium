    <p>Sin­ga­pore will most likely make plans to vac­ci­nate dif­fer­ent seg­ments of the pop­u­la­tion against Covid-19 from next year.</p>
    <p>Those who are more vul­ner­a­ble to the coro­n­avirus and those at higher risk of get­ting in­fected, such as health­care pro­fes­sion­als and oth­ers in front-line roles, may get pri­or­ity for vac­ci­na­tion, the Min­istry of Health’s direc­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices Ken­neth Mak told a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>De­tails of the pri­ori­ti­sa­tion will be worked out by an ex­pert panel, which will also study the var­i­ous vac­cine op­tions.</p>
    <p>“We have con­vened an ex­pert panel of doc­tors and sci­en­tists to ad­vise us with re­gard to which of the vac­cine can­di­dates will be the most suit­able for our set­ting,” said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Mak.</p>
    <p>“I think many of the vac­cine can­di­dates will com­plete the phase three stud­ies only some time next year, and th­ese re­sults then will be care­fully stud­ied and the vac­cines then would un­dergo a reg­is­tra­tion process be­fore we can bring them into Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Hence, it is more likely that the multi-min­istry task force on tack­ling Covid-19 will be mak­ing plans to vac­ci­nate the dif­fer­ent parts of the pop­u­la­tion from next year, rather than this year, Prof Mak added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is look­ing to pro­cure sev­eral dif­fer­ent vac­cines and has not en­coun­tered ma­jor ob­sta­cles in ne­go­ti­at­ing with sup­pli­ers of vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Prof Mak ex­plained: “We are track­ing very closely the stud­ies that are tak­ing place, the phase three stud­ies for var­i­ous vac­cine can­di­dates, and we are await­ing the re­sults with re­gard to both ef­fi­cacy as well as the side ef­fect pro­file.”</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said that by en­gag­ing mul­ti­ple sup­pli­ers, Sin­ga­pore will be able to di­ver­sify its risk in the event that a vac­cine can­di­date is un­suc­cess­ful. The coun­try is also ex­plor­ing new man­u­fac­tur­ers and vac­cine can­di­dates, and con­tin­ues to keep its op­tions open.</p>
    <p>Fac­tors such as the price and quan­tity of the vac­cine, ef­fi­cacy and safety, whether it is suit­able only for cer­tain groups, and the pos­si­bil­ity of ad­verse ef­fects will also have to be con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>Other lo­gis­ti­cal as­pects, such as who should get pri­or­ity for vac­ci­na­tion (which also de­pends on the na­ture of the vac­cine) and how to man­age dis­tri­bu­tion, will also be stud­ied by the ex­pert panel.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan said: “Some of the ad­verse ef­fects could only oc­cur over a longer pe­riod of time. So we also have to bear in mind the po­ten­tial risks of th­ese vac­cines... It’s a balanc­ing be­tween the ben­e­fits and the risks in de­ter­min­ing what vac­cines we should adopt and how we should ap­ply it in the lo­cal con­text.”</p>
