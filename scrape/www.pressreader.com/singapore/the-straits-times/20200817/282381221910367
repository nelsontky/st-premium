    <p>In the new Ap­ple TV+ com­edy Ted Lasso, Ja­son Sudeikis plays an Amer­i­can foot­ball coach who is in­ex­pli­ca­bly hired to coach an English Premier League team de­spite know­ing next to noth­ing about soc­cer.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times and other me­dia by video call re­cently, star and creator Sudeikis ex­plains the in­spi­ra­tion for his ir­re­press­ibly en­thu­si­as­tic char­ac­ter and how he him­self grew to love soc­cer.</p>
    <p>Lasso was a char­ac­ter Sudeikis first por­trayed in a se­ries of 2013 and 2014 ad­ver­tise­ments to pro­mote Premier League cov­er­age on the Amer­i­can tele­vi­sion net­work NBC.</p>
    <p>The clips in­tro­duced him as a col­lege foot­ball coach from Kansas City who is hi­lar­i­ously clue­less about soc­cer, and they were so pop­u­lar they in­spired Sudeikis and writer-pro­ducer Bill Lawrence (Scrubs, 2001 to 2010) to cre­ate a se­ries around him.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor con­fesses that much like the char­ac­ter, he was once not ter­ri­bly savvy about soc­cer.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t know much. The lit­tle I learnt was from play­ing it as a kid, but then bas­ket­ball be­came my sport.</p>
    <p>“But I learnt a great deal when I worked in Am­s­ter­dam and played (the video game) Fifa 2000 in headto-head bat­tles with my buddy Bren­dan Hunt, who is one of the writ­ers on Ted Lasso and plays coach Beard.”</p>
    <p>He then had “a long break from it”. “And do­ing those com­mer­cials, I re­ally fell in love with the game in a more grown-up way,” adds the 44-year-old, who starred in the hit come­dies Hor­ri­ble Bosses (2011) and We’re The Millers (2013).</p>
    <p>Now, Sudeikis pro­fesses to “truly love the game, and that’s been main­tained through the quar­an­tine as a lot of the ac­tors and writ­ers on the show have been play­ing (the video game) Fifa 21 Pro Clubs to­gether”.</p>
    <p>“And now when I watch soc­cer games, I have a slightly bet­ter idea of what the heck’s go­ing on.”</p>
    <p>Sudeikis’ co-writer and co-pro­ducer, Lawrence – who co-cre­ated the hit TV come­dies Spin City (1996 to 2002) and Cougar Town (2009 to 2015) – ex­plains that it was vi­tal to make Lasso a coach of Amer­i­can foot­ball at the col­le­giate and not the pro­fes­sional or Na­tional Foot­ball League (NFL) level.</p>
    <p>“That was one smart thing Ja­son put in be­cause he wanted to make a hope­ful and op­ti­mistic show,” says the 51-year-old.</p>
    <p>“In­ter­na­tion­ally, peo­ple might not re­alise the dif­fer­ence, but for NFL coaches, it’s all about busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“But all the suc­cess­ful col­le­giate coaches are renowned for cre­at­ing a fam­ily-like en­vi­ron­ment – the play­ers are their boys and the re­la­tion­ships tran­scend that of play­er­coach.”</p>
    <p>This, says Lawrence, is some­thing English pro­fes­sional soc­cer teams might learn from some­one like Lasso.</p>
    <p>“In the show, what we see in the Premier League is pro­fes­sional ath­letes and coaches who maybe have more of a busi­ness re­la­tion­ship, and Ted brings this very Amer­i­can at­ti­tude of, ‘That’s not enough for me – we’re go­ing to know each other, we’re go­ing to love each other.’”</p>
    <p>The char­ac­ter is the clas­sic fish out of wa­ter when he is abruptly hired by a Premier League club’s owner to take over as man­ager of the team – for rea­sons re­vealed in the first episode but kept se­cret from Lasso.</p>
    <p>But de­spite nu­mer­ous set­backs,</p>
    <p>Lasso is cheer­fully un­de­terred.</p>
    <p>“It’s that in­fec­tious sweet­ness of the Ted char­ac­ter from the com­mer­cials that we fol­lowed for the show,” Sudeikis says.</p>
    <p>The se­ries is also in­fused with what Sudeikis and Lawrence fully ad­mit is a rather Amer­i­can op­ti­mism – some­thing the Bri­tish ac­tors and writ­ers on the show would tease them about.</p>
    <p>Says Lawrence: “Ja­son and I be­came very close to Bri­tish ac­tor and writer Brett Gold­stein, who plays soc­cer star Roy, and Brett is con­stantly struck by my in­her­ent op­ti­mism.”</p>
    <p>And one ob­ser­va­tion by Gold­stein that be­came part of a scene sums up this cul­tural dif­fer­ence, Sudeikis re­calls. “In Amer­ica, you say, ‘Do you be­lieve in mir­a­cles?’ And in the United King­dom, we say: ‘It’s the hope that kills you.’”</p>
    <p>Yet, as they shot the show on lo­ca­tion in Eng­land, “peo­ple were as cheery as can be”, the ac­tor ob­serves.</p>
    <p>“Maybe it’s just the Lasso ef­fect. And as the se­ries moves on, you see peo­ple’s opin­ions of Ted go from mock­ing and cyn­i­cal to ‘Oh, maybe this guy’s for real.’ And that was the in­tent.”</p>
    <p>Ted Lasso is avail­able on Ap­ple TV+.</p>
