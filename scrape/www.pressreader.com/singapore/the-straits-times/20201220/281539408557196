    <p>He re­mem­bers the buzz of the 2015 SEA Games in Sin­ga­pore as he was one of the torch­bear­ers for the torch re­lay. But never did Jeremy Sim ex­pect he would ever get a chance to rep­re­sent the Repub­lic at a ma­jor Games.</p>
    <p>Four years later, the b-boy (breaker) was shar­ing the same stage as na­tional swim­mers and fencers as he claimed a bronze medal in the men’s break­ing event at the bi­en­nial Games in the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>The free­lance dance in­struc­tor, 24, whose in­ter­est in break­ing was piqued by the Step Up dance movie fran­chise, said: “It was a pleas­ant sur­prise to com­pete at the SEA Games and win a medal.</p>
    <p>“I felt I could have done bet­ter but it was an amaz­ing ex­pe­ri­ence and I would love to go through it again.”</p>
    <p>That de­sire could be­come a re­al­ity when break­ing makes its Olympic Games de­but at Paris 2024. This fol­lows its ap­pear­ance at the 2018 Youth Olympics, when 24 b-boys and b-girls broke new ground i n Buenos Aires, Ar­gentina.</p>
    <p>SCEP­TI­CISM</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to in­clude break­ing in the Olympic pro­gramme has raised eye­brows world­wide.</p>
    <p>But Felix Huang, founder of break­ing group Radikal Forze and widely re­garded as the face of the Sin­ga­pore break­ing scene, felt that ques­tion­ing the le­git­i­macy of break­ing as an Olympic sport is un­war­ranted.</p>
    <p>Huang, 39, said: “To many, break­ing is just brain­less move­ment, but there is a lot of his­tory and foun­da­tion in the move­ments.</p>
    <p>“It is also ex­tremely tax­ing phys­i­cally, more so than soc­cer, swim­ming and bad­minton. Spin­ning on your head is not some­thing that comes as nat­u­rally as kick­ing a ball or swing­ing a racket.</p>
    <p>“It is not some­thing you take only a year or two to mas­ter be­cause it is ex­tremely dy­namic.”</p>
    <p>He also urged scep­tics to look at the big­ger pic­ture and noted: “Some peo­ple may have low tol­er­ance for things that don’t look or feel nor­mal, but we are in 2020 now and we need to change our mind­set.</p>
    <p>“We need a re­ju­ve­na­tion of the sports line-up and in­tro­duce new sports in the pro­gramme be­cause the Olympics need changes and evo­lu­tion to be­come more hip and res­onate with newer and younger view­ers.”</p>
    <p>SUITED FOR SIN­GA­PORE­ANS?</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, break­ing has come a long way since it was as­so­ci­ated with delin­quency in the 1980s.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the coro­n­avirus out­break, Sin­ga­pore had a vi­brant break­ing scene, with break­ers seen prac­tis­ing or per­form­ing at public spa­ces like the Es­planade base­ment, *Scape, the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity base­ment, The Star Vista and even Changi Air­port.</p>
    <p>Last year, there were com­pe­ti­tions or­gan­ised by dance stu­dios, school clubs and break­ers, hap­pen­ing as of­ten as once a week and with about 60 to 80 par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>The an­nual *Scape Radikal Forze Jam also grew from a turnout of 200 in 2008 to more than 10,000 dancers from over 40 coun­tries last year.</p>
    <p>Huang, who is also the Sin­ga­pore Dance­s­port Fed­er­a­tion’s (SGDF) break­ing lead, es­ti­mates there are about 20 to 30 crews and about 1,000 break­ers here, with about 100 of them com­pet­i­tive.</p>
    <p>De­spite the rel­a­tively small tal­ent pool in Sin­ga­pore, he felt the stan­dards at the top were com­pa­ra­ble to the best in the world and a Sin­ga­porean breaker qual­i­fy­ing for the 2024 Games was a pos­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal athletes who earn a spot at the Sum­mer Games tra­di­tion­ally come from in­di­vid­ual sports like ta­ble ten­nis, swim­ming, sail­ing and shoot­ing.</p>
    <p>Deloitte sports business group leader James Wal­ton felt break­ing was an­other av­enue, say­ing: “There’s of­ten a lot of talk about ge­netic dif­fer­ences with re­gard to strength and physique, which should not be an is­sue with break­ing.</p>
    <p>“There also shouldn’t be a prob­lem in terms of ac­cess to fa­cil­i­ties be­cause it is a sport you can re­ally do any­where. So if the sport is in the Olympics for the long term, there would be po­ten­tial for Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>LONG ROAD AHEAD</p>
    <p>The path to Paris 2024 is paved with un­cer­tain­ties though.</p>
    <p>Un­like main­stream Olympic sports like bad­minton, sail­ing, shoot­ing, swim­ming and ta­ble ten­nis, whose athletes ben­e­fit from multi-year plans and fund­ing as well as top-level coach­ing and sports sci­ence sup­port, the break­ing ecosys­tem is far more loosely struc­tured and or­gan­ised.</p>
    <p>SGDF pres­i­dent Robert Ong said: “With tal­ent and hard work, it is pos­si­ble for us to groom an Olympian, but we need more in­for­ma­tion such as the con­ti­nen­tal quota and qual­i­fy­ing cri­te­ria and events be­fore we can make plans.”</p>
    <p>Even get­ting Sim on the plane to the Philip­pines for the SEA Games was not straight­for­ward.</p>
    <p>Break­ing was fea­tured for the first time and Huang had to con­vince the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Olympic Coun­cil of Sim’s el­i­gi­bil­ity, us­ing his re­sults against re­gional ri­vals in in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tions as jus­ti­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Huang said: “There is a dif­fer­ence be­tween com­pet­i­tive and recre­ational break­ing. The key is to get com­pet­i­tive ex­po­sure and, for that, we need fund­ing and sup­port from the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“Like any other sport, train­ing, tak­ing phys­i­cal care and peak­ing at the right time are all part of the process of do­ing well in a break­ing com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>“Many of our com­pet­i­tive break­ers have day jobs and they will need fi­nan­cial sup­port so they can fo­cus on im­prov­ing their craft, in­stead of wor­ry­ing about whether they can make ends meet while try­ing to make it to the Olympics.”</p>
    <p>Sim, who trains six days a week to hone the ba­sic el­e­ments of top rock, foot­work, power moves and freezes, said sup­port in terms of sports sci­ence for med­i­cal and re­cov­ery needs is also cru­cial.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Sport In­sti­tute chief Toh Boon Yi said such help would be forth­com­ing.</p>
    <p>He added: “Our dance­s­port athletes proved their met­tle at the re­gional level when they won five medals at the 2019 SEA Games.</p>
    <p>“With break­ing fea­tur­ing at the Paris Olympics, an­other gen­er­a­tion and genre of dance athletes can as­pire to join the sport­ing fra­ter­nity’s quest to in­spire pride and ex­cel­lence.</p>
    <p>“We will be on the look­out for promis­ing break­ing athletes who have not tra­di­tion­ally been on our radar and con­tinue to sup­port our athletes so that they per­form at their best.”</p>
    <p>LOOK­ING TO DO BET­TER</p>
    <p>It was a pleas­ant sur­prise to com­pete at the SEA Games and win a medal. I felt I could have done bet­ter but it was an amaz­ing ex­pe­ri­ence and I would love to go through it again.</p>

    <p>TOUGHER THAN MOST</p>
    <p>It is also ex­tremely tax­ing phys­i­cally, more so than soc­cer, swim­ming and bad­minton. It is not some­thing you take only a year or two to mas­ter be­cause it is ex­tremely dy­namic.</p>
