    <p>KUALA LUMPUR The United States banned im­ports of palm oil from Malaysian pro­ducer Sime Darby Plan­ta­tion from Wed­nes­day over allegation­s of forced labour in the pro­duc­tion process, the US Cus­toms and Border Pro­tec­tion (CBP) said.</p>
    <p>The ban on Sime Darby, the world’s largest palm oil com­pany by land size and seen as a leader in sus­tain­ably pro­duced palm oil, is another blow to an in­dus­try that has faced mount­ing allegation­s of labour and hu­man rights abuses.</p>
    <p>Palm oil is used in ev­ery­thing from food to c o s me t i c s to biodiesel. It is mainly pro­duced in Malaysia and In­done­sia, where the pro­duc­ers are also blamed for wide-scale de­for­esta­tion and habi­tat destruc­tion.</p>
    <p>Sime Darby is the third Malaysian com­pany to be slapped with a US ban last year over forced labour allegation­s af­ter FGV Hold­ings, another Malaysian palm oil pro­ducer, and Top Glove, the world’s big­gest pro­ducer of med­i­cal-grade la­tex gloves.</p>
    <p>The CBP said it is­sued a “with­hold re­lease or­der” on Sime Darby, which will al­low it to de­tain ship­ments based on sus­pi­cion of forced labour in­volve­ment un­der long­stand­ing US laws aimed at com­bat­ing hu­man traf­fick­ing, child labour and other hu­man rights abuses.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Sime Darby did not com­ment im­me­di­ately on the ban and allegation­s.</p>
    <p>The CBP said the or­der was based on a months-long in­ves­ti­ga­tion that rea­son­ably in­di­cated the pres­ence of the In­ter­na­tional Labour Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s forced labour in­di­ca­tors at Sime Darby plan­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>Malaysia re­lies on over 337,000 mi­grant work­ers from coun­tries like In­done­sia, In­dia and Bangladesh to har­vest the palm fruit.</p>
    <p>The ban on Sime Darby, ef­fec­tive from Wed­nes­day, could be lifted if re­me­dial ac­tion is taken.</p>
    <p>The CBP said the United States im­ported about US$410 mil­lion (S$540 mil­lion) worth of crude palm oil from Malaysia in the fis­cal year that ended in Septem­ber 2020, ac­count­ing for just over 30 per cent of the US to­tal palm oil pur­chases.</p>
    <p>Sime Darby says its an­nual ex­ports to the US to­tal about US$5 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>In July, Hong Kong-based an­ti­traf­fick­ing group Lib­erty Shared pe­ti­tioned the CBP to ban Sime Darby prod­ucts, cit­ing ev­i­dence of labour abuse.</p>
    <p>Sime Darby said at that time that the allegation­s con­tra­dicted the group’s pub­lic com­mit­ments to re­spon­si­ble agricultur­e and hu­man rights.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve that we have a re­spon­si­bil­ity to re­spect, sup­port, and up­hold fun­da­men­tal hu­man rights as ex­pressed in the Universal Dec­la­ra­tion for Hu­man Rights and the United Na­tions Guid­ing Prin­ci­ples on Busi­ness and Hu­man Rights,” the com­pany says on its web­site.</p>
