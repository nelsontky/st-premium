    <p>While Covid-19 has in­fected about 65 mil­lion peo­ple world­wide, mis­in­for­ma­tion, fake news and con­spir­acy the­o­ries about the virus have prob­a­bly spread to bil­lions. Ben­jamin Seet and Ren Ee Chee clear the air about vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Q Can Covid-19 vac­cines cause long-term com­pli­ca­tions?</p>
    <p>A It is too early to tell. Some com­pli­ca­tions are so rare that they are seen only once ev­ery one mil­lion to two mil­lion vac­ci­na­tions, some­times as long as one to two years later.</p>
    <p>To date, only about 200,000 peo­ple have taken part in late-stage clin­i­cal tri­als for dif­fer­ent Covid-19 vac­cines world­wide, with the long­est follow-up not ex­ceed­ing four months. So it is still too early to draw firm con­clu­sions.</p>
    <p>What we do know is that ma­jor vac­cine com­pa­nies have been very trans­par­ent with their data, and have taken the un­prece­dented step of pub­lish­ing their clin­i­cal trial pro­to­cols and in­terim re­sults.</p>
    <p>These are sub­mit­ted to health reg­u­la­tors who as­sess the data with tough guide­lines also ap­plied to other vac­cines.</p>
    <p>There are no short­cuts when it comes to es­tab­lish­ing the safety of a vac­cine. We should ex­pect no less with Covid-19 vac­cines, de­spite their com­pressed de­vel­op­ment time­lines.</p>
    <p>Q Can an RNA vac­cine change my DNA?</p>
    <p>A There are some who claim that ri­bonu­cleic acid (RNA) vac­cines can ma­nip­u­late and change hu­man de­oxyri­bonu­cleic acid or DNA, re­sult­ing in a ge­net­i­cally mod­i­fied hu­man.</p>
    <p>Bi­o­log­i­cally, it just does not work that way. DNA uses one set of mol­e­cules for its ge­netic code, while RNA is made up of a dif­fer­ent set of mol­e­cules.</p>
    <p>The ge­netic in­for­ma­tion flow is one-way: DNA con­tains in­for­ma­tion that cells use to make mes­sen­ger RNA (mRNA), which in turn pro­vides a tem­plate to as­sem­ble pro­teins the body needs. The mRNA in Covid-19 vac­cines can­not change hu­man DNA.</p>
    <p>Be­sides, the half-life of mRNA vac­cines is very short. Once in­jected, it is quickly taken up by the body’s cells and broken down af­ter 48 hours. The in­fluenza virus is an RNA virus. When you catch the flu, you are in fact get­ting a mas­sive dose of virus RNA. It can make you sick, but it does not change your DNA.</p>
    <p>Q</p>
    <p>Does Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion in­ject live viruses into your body?</p>
    <p>A There are dif­fer­ent types of Covid-19 vac­cines.</p>
    <p>One com­mon vac­cine is made up of dead viruses that have been chem­i­cally in­ac­ti­vated and are no longer in­fec­tious. These in­clude the vac­cines pro­duced by Si­no­vac, Sinopharm and Val­neva.</p>
    <p>An­other type of vac­cine makes use of a com­mon virus, called ade­n­ovirus, to trans­port a small frag­ment of Sars-CoV-2 gene into cells.</p>
    <p>Such vi­ral vec­tors are weak­ened so that they pose lit­tle risk of caus­ing ill­ness com­pared with a nat­u­ral in­fec­tion. Ex­am­ples of vac­cines that em­ploy ade­n­oviruses in­clude the ones pro­duced by As­traZeneca, John­son & John­son and CanSino, and the Rus­sian Sput­nik V vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Other lead­ing pro­grammes from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, No­vavax and Sanofi use biotech­nol­ogy to man­u­fac­ture ei­ther RNA or pro</p>
