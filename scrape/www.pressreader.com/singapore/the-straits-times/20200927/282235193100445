    <p>The wa­ter is an invit­ing 32 deg C as three mums and a dad slide into their in­di­vid­ual swim pods – so­cially dis­tanced, of course – in­side a re­stored colo­nial build­ing in Dempsey.</p>
    <p>They lift their ba­bies from the chic rat­tan bassinets placed along­side and ease them into the $1,500 in­flat­able pools, each of which has a fil­tra­tion and sani­ti­sa­tion sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Large photo back­drops of pools add to the re­sort vibe, as do the trendy chevron-print floor mats and pot­ted plants.</p>
    <p>Ms Kris­ten Ro­main, founder of Swish! Swim­ming school, beams as she ob­serves how en­gaged the par­ents are with their ba­bies, none of whom throws a tantrum dur­ing the 45-minute class.</p>
    <p>It is a far cry from late March, when the seven-year-old cen­tre with four pools in Dempsey had to close un­der pan­demic re­stric­tions. For more than three months, it had no rev­enue.</p>
    <p>While de­mand was strong once it re­opened in July, ca­pac­ity caps and so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures meant that it “hit a ceil­ing on what we could of­fer”, says Ms Ro­main. This was es­pe­cially true for baby classes as a par­ent has to be present as well.</p>
    <p>Other ven­dors of­fer­ing classes for ba­bies and tod­dlers face the same ca­pac­ity chal­lenges be­cause of the par­ent in­volve­ment needed for this age group.</p>
    <p>Sport Sin­ga­pore’s cap of five in­di­vid­u­als in a group and one per­son per 10.7 sq ft of gross floor area means that only two par­ent-child pairs can at­tend a ses­sion, un­less the space can ac­com­mo­date more than one group. Classes with more than one group must place them 3m apart, with no in­ter­ac­tion al­lowed be­tween groups.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, some cen­tres have sus­pended their baby cour­ses, oth­ers have gone on­line and a few, like Swish! Swim­ming, have cre­ated new prod­ucts and pro­grammes to en­tice par­ents while stay­ing safe.</p>
    <p>With lim­ited spots avail­able in phys­i­cal classes, some cen­tres re­port long wait­ing lists as well.</p>
    <p>Ms Ro­main hit upon the novel con­cept of pri­vate pools for ba­bies and de­buted her trial project this month. While she does not know if she will be able to re­coup her in­vest­ment, she is heart­ened by the ini­tial re­sponse from par­ents, who have signed up for 80 per cent of the avail­able classes.</p>
    <p>“They like that they are in­doors, the wa­ter is tem­per­a­ture-con­trolled and there is mu­sic scored to the ac­tiv­i­ties,” she says.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, some cen­tres have hit the pause but­ton on their baby classes, con­strained by space lim­its or safety fac­tors. They in­clude ZooPhon­ics Sin­ga­pore, which has been run­ning its Zoo Tod­dlers phon­ics pro­gramme since 2006, and Able Aquatic School, a 39-year-old out­fit that has been run­ning baby swim classes for the last 11 years.</p>
    <p>The safety and well-be­ing of its young charges and staff were also be­hind Baby Sen­sory Sin­ga­pore’s de­ci­sion to pivot fully on­line for now. The lo­cal off­shoot of an award-win­ning Bri­tish baby de­vel­op­ment pro­gramme, it is run by a team from the Josiah Montes­sori child­care group.</p>
    <p>It l aunched the Baby Sen­sory Sin­ga­pore@home se­ries in July to equip par­ents with ideas on en­gag­ing their lit­tle ones at home, but class leader San­dra Heng ad­mits that the re­sponse has been slow. Its stu­dent base has plum­meted from 50 pre-Covid-19 to about eight now.</p>
    <p>“The ma­jor­ity of our reg­u­lar par­ents pre­fer to come for phys­i­cal classes for the so­cial fac­tor and also be­cause they pre­fer not to ex­pose their child below age three to screen time,” she says.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic also scup­pered Grow­ing Up Gifted’s plans to launch an Early Starters pro­gramme for ba­bies aged six to 12 months old, says Ms Deanne Chong-Duffield, founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of the group, which of­fers en­rich­ment cour­ses for chil­dren up to age eight. It also runs a preschool. It has re­sumed its Smart Babes and Smart Tots classes, with ca­pac­ity halved to about five chil­dren a ses­sion.</p>
    <p>“Par­ents have been very ea­ger to re­turn to classes,” says Ms ChongDuffi­eld, adding that both par­ents and its teach­ers no­ticed that ba­bies be­came “more with­drawn” af­ter the lack of so­cial­i­sa­tion dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Even as cen­tres re­open, many strug­gle with in­creased costs be­cause of safety reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>VivoKi­net­ics founder Vi­vian Eng had to hire more part-time coaches for her Vivo Kids Multi-sport Pro­gramme for tod­dlers and says her ex­ist­ing coaches now work longer hours.</p>
    <p>In­stead of one pitch and two coaches for 10 par­ent-child pairs be­fore the pan­demic, she now needs two pitches and four coaches for eight par­ent-child pairs.</p>
    <p>“It is twice the pre-Covid-19 op­er­a­tion cost – not for­get­ting the cost of sani­tis­ing ameni­ties and the ex­tra equip­ment needed too,” Ms Eng says, adding she has not raised fees.</p>
    <p>At some cen­tres, the pent-up de­mand for phys­i­cal classes has led to long wait­ing lists as par­ents jos­tle for lim­ited va­can­cies.</p>
    <p>He­guru Method, which of­fers a Ja­panese right-brain train­ing pro­gramme, has wait-lists of “six months or even longer for our peak tim­ings”, says prin­ci­pal and co-founder Agnes Ng.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, The Lit­tle Gym, Sin­ga­pore, the lo­cal fran­chisee of an in­ter­na­tional chil­dren’s fit­ness and de­vel­op­ment chain, has al­most 80 chil­dren on its wait-list for par­entchild classes, says Mr Richard Vil­larin, its gym direc­tor.</p>
    <p>Par­ents who have taken their ba­bies to en­rich­ment classes are ea­ger for more. Ms Aristi Faezah, 34, says her nine-month-old daugh­ter Le­an­dra Azura en­joyed her two lessons at Swish! Swim­ming’s pods.</p>
    <p>“I feel she’s quite com­fort­able in the pod,” says the mar­ket­ing pro­fes­sional, adding that she is hop­ing to get a spot in the swim school’s par­ent-baby lessons in its other pools.</p>
    <p>Ba­bies and tod­dlers learn through ob­serv­ing, im­i­tat­ing and ex­plor­ing in a “safe, se­cure and stim­u­lat­ing en­vi­ron­ment such as their home”, says Dr Mary Varugh­ese, a con­sul­tant i n the Divi­sion of Gen­eral Am­bu­la­tory Pae­di­atrics and Ado­les­cent Medicine at the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>While par­ents may en­rol very young chil­dren i n en­rich­ment classes to learn skills that they them­selves may not pos­sess, such as swim­ming or lan­guages, she notes that this age group tends to be clingy and prefers to play alone.</p>
    <p>“For th­ese ba­bies, par­ent-ac­com­pa­nied classes are more ben­e­fi­cial as they pro­mote bond­ing be­tween par­ent and child, which should be con­tin­ued even at home.”</p>
    <p>Par­ents should take sen­si­ble pre­cau­tions, like mak­ing sure the class has small groups spaced at least 2m apart, wash­ing their ba­bies’ hands with soap and wa­ter af­ter each ses­sion and avoid­ing classes if they or their kids have flu-like symp­toms.</p>
    <p>On­line en­rich­ment is a “safe al­ter­na­tive” dur­ing the pan­demic, she adds. Although ex­perts dis­cour­age screen time for ba­bies younger than 18 months and ad­vise a 30-minute limit for tod­dlers aged 18 months to two years old, the type of screen time ac­tiv­ity also mat­ters, she stresses.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, 30 min­utes of on­line in­ter­ac­tion with an in­struc­tor is un­likely to cause harm to a tod­dler who is ac­com­pa­nied by an in­volved par­ent or care­giver.”</p>
