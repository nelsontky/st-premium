    <p>Sin­ga­pore can im­prove racial har­mony by har­ness­ing its di­ver­sity as both strength and en­hance­ment, said Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong dur­ing a di­a­logue on race re­la­tions yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Cre­at­ing a safe space for con­struc­tive dis­course and get­ting Sin­ga­pore­ans to work to­gether across racial lines were other sug­ges­tions out­lined by him in his key­note speech in the di­a­logue se­ries ti­tled Re­gard­less Of Race.</p>
    <p>About 100 peo­ple par­tic­i­pated in the ses­sion, the fifth in the se­ries, via video-con­fer­enc­ing.</p>
    <p>It was or­gan­ised by OnePeo­ple.sg – the na­tional body pro­mot­ing racial har­mony – and the Eurasian As­so­ci­a­tion, in part­ner­ship with the Mother­ship.sg web­site. “How do we trans­late our mul­tira­cial­ism into a strength?” Mr Tong, who is also Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Law, asked in his key­note speech.</p>
    <p>“How do we strengthen the di­verse threads which make up the Sin­ga­pore ta­pes­try, so that each thread – each race, re­li­gion, cul­ture – is strong on its own, (and) the over­all ta­pes­try you weave to­gether is not only stronger than the sum of its parts, but also beau­ti­fully en­hanced by its di­ver­sity?”</p>
    <p>He added that the real test of the ma­tu­rity and re­silience of Sin­ga­pore’s racial har­mony would be mea­sured by how it responds to spiky or thorny is­sues emerg­ing be­tween races.</p>
    <p>He noted that the evolv­ing na­ture of such dis­cus­sions may some­times cause dis­com­fort among older gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“We must feel, first of all, safe dis­cussing with­out be­ing ‘called out’ or ‘can­celled’,” he added.</p>
    <p>“We may have dif­fer­ent views… on what are the per­ceived racial in­equal­i­ties that might ex­ist in a work­place, or what are some of the in­stances of ca­sual racism.</p>
    <p>“(But) we must chart a path for­ward which has a com­mon un­der­stand­ing as to what is ac­cept­able and what is not.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, Mr Tong shared re­sponses to an In­sta­gram poll he con­ducted to un­earth race-based is­sues of in­ter­est to peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“Many of the re­spon­dents felt it was im­por­tant to learn and ac­cept each other’s dif­fer­ences and back­grounds,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The sec­ond point that came through was that it was im­por­tant to em­pha­sise unity, and forge a com­mon iden­tity as one peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Re­spon­dents were also “very con­cerned” about be­ing in­clu­sive in how race is­sues are dis­cussed, Mr Tong noted, adding that social media was the “mar­ket­place” for such con­sid­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>He said the more Sin­ga­pore­ans work, play and live across racial lines, the more they would be able to see be­yond race and in­stead see a col­league, neigh­bour, friend or class­mate.</p>
    <p>He also said Sin­ga­pore’s four self-help groups were ex­plor­ing new ways to bet­ter sup­port and ser­vice the com­mu­nity at large, be­yond the racial lines they were ini­tially formed along.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong said the Gov­ern­ment re­mained com­mit­ted to nur­tur­ing strong part­ner­ships with the peo­ple, by pro­vid­ing ad­vice, guid­ance and net­works to re­alise ground-up ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve strongly in co-cre­ation and work­ing with the com­mu­nity,” he said. “I think it’s the lived ex­pe­ri­ence, the ideas on the ground that are most use­ful.”</p>
