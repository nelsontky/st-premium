    <p>There were 13 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,273.</p>
    <p>All 13 new cases are im­ported and were placed on stay-home no­tices on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>The new cases com­prised a Sin­ga­porean, a per­ma­nent res­i­dent, 10 work per­mit hold­ers and a de­pen­dant’s pass holder.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean, a 38-year-old man who had re­turned from In­done­sia, ex­pe­ri­enced the on­set of symp­toms last Fri­day and was con­firmed pos­i­tive on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing 12 cases are asymp­to­matic and were de­tected through proac­tive screening and sur­veil­lance, the min­istry said last night.</p>
    <p>The per­ma­nent res­i­dent is a 47-year-old woman who ar­rived from In­dia. She is linked to a case con­firmed last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>That ear­lier case is a Sin­ga­porean who also ar­rived here from In­dia.</p>
    <p>The 10 work per­mit hold­ers, who are cur­rently em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore, ar­rived from In­dia, In­done­sia, Malaysia and Myan­mar.</p>
    <p>The last case – the de­pen­dant’s pass holder – ar­rived from Bangladesh.</p>
    <p>They were all tested while serv­ing their stay-home no­tices at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>There were no new cases in work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries and none in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>With eight cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,153 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 28 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 48 pa­tients are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 29 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>MOH said the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with a to­tal of two cases in the past week, of which one is cur­rently un­linked.</p>
