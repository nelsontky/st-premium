    <p>The Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) has banned two for­mer bankers for fraud and dis­hon­est con­duct fol­low­ing their con­vic­tions in the State Courts in sep­a­rate cases.</p>
    <p>Lu Chor Sheng, a for­mer trea­sury ad­viser with OCBC Bank, was served with a 17-year pro­hi­bi­tion or­der (PO), while Timothy Tan Swee Thiam, a for­mer re­la­tion­ship man­ager at United Over­seas Bank (UOB), was banned for nine years, the reg­u­la­tor said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The POs bar the i ndi­vid­u­als from per­form­ing any reg­u­lated ac­tiv­ity un­der the Se­cu­ri­ties and Fu­tures Act, and from pro­vid­ing any fi­nan­cial ad­vi­sory ser­vice un­der the Fi­nan­cial Ad­vis­ers Act for the pe­riod stated.</p>
    <p>The or­ders against the duo took ef­fect on Thurs­day, MAS said.</p>
    <p>They are also barred from tak­ing part in the man­age­ment, act­ing as a di­rec­tor or be­com­ing a sub­stan­tial share­holder of a cap­i­tal mar­ket ser­vices or fi­nan­cial ad­vi­sory firm.</p>
    <p>Lu was con­victed of abet­ment of cheat­ing un­der the Pe­nal Code, unau­tho­rised mod­i­fi­ca­tion of the con­tents of OCBC’s sys­tem un­der the Com­puter Mis­use Act (CMA) and of­fences un­der the Cor­rup­tion, Drug Traf­fick­ing and Other Se­ri­ous Crimes (Con­fis­ca­tion of Ben­e­fits) Act. He was sen­tenced to 100 months in prison.</p>
    <p>Be­tween Jan­uary 2011 and June 2013, Lu used the OCBC ac­counts of a friend to place unau­tho­rised for­ward for­eign ex­change (FX) trades with off-mar­ket rates in the bank’s sys­tem, so that he could buy lower and sell higher than the pre­vail­ing mar­ket rates.</p>
    <p>To re­alise prof­its, Lu placed ad­di­tional unau­tho­rised trades in his cus­tomers’ ac­counts as coun­ter­par­ties to the trades placed in his friend’s ac­counts and told his cus­tomers that th­ese were er­ro­neous trades that would be re­versed at no loss to them.</p>
    <p>Lu also in­sti­gated a friend to im­per­son­ate a cus­tomer to place unau­tho­rised or­ders with OCBC, in or­der to close off unau­tho­rised FX trades that he had placed in those cus­tomers’ ac­counts.</p>
    <p>When dis­cov­ered by OCBC, the bank closed the out­stand­ing con­tracts in Lu’s cus­tomer ac­counts.</p>
    <p>It suf­fered a to­tal loss of $3.09 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Lu made a profit of about $1.09 mil­lion from his mis­con­duct and used the monies to buy for­eign cur­ren­cies and re­pay debts.</p>
    <p>Tan, the for­mer UOB banker, was con­victed of crim­i­nal breach of trust un­der the Pe­nal Code and of­fences un­der the CMA. He was sen­tenced to 30 months in prison.</p>
    <p>Tan’s friend, a UOB cus­tomer, had en­trusted her UOB bank ac­counts, In­ter­net bank­ing se­cu­rity to­ken and UOB ATM card to him.</p>
    <p>Be­tween March 2015 and Jan­uary 2016, Tan made unau­tho­rised In­ter­net bank trans­fers amount­ing to around $263,500 from this cus­tomer’s UOB ac­count to his per­sonal bank ac­count to pay for his liv­ing ex­penses.</p>
