    <p>BRUSSELS • Mil­lions of Euro­peans will face greater re­stric­tions on move­ment this week as gov­ern­ments es­ca­lated ef­forts to check the surge in coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>The in­creased re­stric­tions come as new cases hit daily records across much of the con­ti­nent.</p>
    <p>Switzer­land said gath­er­ings of more than 15 peo­ple i n pub­lic places will be banned from today and masks must be worn in all in­door pub­lic places.</p>
    <p>An or­der to wear masks on pub­lic trans­port has been ex­tended to cover train sta­tions, air­ports, bus and tram stops, said the gov­ern­ment af­ter an ex­tra­or­di­nary meet­ing, re­plac­ing a patch­work of reg­u­la­tions that had ap­plied across Switzer­land’s dif­fer­ent re­gions.</p>
    <p>The obli­ga­tion to wear a mask will also ap­ply to shops, schools, churches and cine­mas.</p>
    <p>“The Covid-19 in­fec­tion rate has in­creased at a very quick rate,” Swiss Pres­i­dent Si­mon­etta Som­maruga said. “Un­like be­fore, it is af­fect­ing all can­tons and all age groups. With win­ter com­ing, it is very im­por­tant to slow the spread of the virus now. Ev­ery day counts.”</p>
    <p>Switzer­land, a coun­try of 8.6 mil­lion peo­ple, last Fri­day re­ported the high­est daily num­ber of in­fec­tions since the Covid-19 cri­sis be­gan, with 3,105 new cases. So far, 74,422 peo­ple have been in­fected, and 1,823 peo­ple have died.</p>
    <p>In Ire­land, Higher Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Si­mon Har­ris yes­ter­day told na­tional broad­caster RTE the gov­ern­ment will bring in “de­ci­sive” na­tion­wide curbs today but will stop short of rein­tro­duc­ing the kind of lock­down im­posed ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>“The ac­tion will be de­ci­sive and it will be na­tion­wide ac­tion,” said Mr Har­ris, who was the health min­is­ter dur­ing one of Europe’s strictest lock­downs from the end of March to mid-May.</p>
    <p>“To­mor­row we will have to bring in more re­stric­tions. Level 3 has not worked... I don’t want to be pedan­tic about the phrase lock­down as I don’t think that’s ex­actly where we’re go­ing – but there will cer­tainly be more re­stric­tions.”</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, Ire­land broke its record for the num­ber of cases in a sin­gle day for the fourth time in the space of a week, bring­ing cases per 100,000 peo­ple in the past 14 days to 232, the 12th high­est rate among the 31 coun­tries mon­i­tored by the Euro­pean Cen­tre for Disease Preven­tion and Con­trol.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment moved three coun­ties on its open bor­der with North­ern Ire­land, which is harder hit by Covid-19, to level 4 of its fivestep frame­work last Wed­nes­day, and banned most vis­its to homes across the coun­try. The other 23 coun­ties are on level 3, which bans all in­door restau­rant din­ing.</p>
    <p>Un­der level 4, only es­sen­tial re­tail can stay open, al­though the gov­ern­ment has broad­ened that cat­e­gory since March.</p>
    <p>Un­der level 5, peo­ple would be asked to stay home, but can ex­er­cise within 5km, and restau­rants can op­er­ate only a take­away and de­liv­ery ser­vice.</p>
    <p>In Bel­gium, Prime Min­is­ter Alexan­der de Croo said hos­pi­tal­ity re­stric­tions, along with a mid­night to 5am cur­few and curbs on al­co­hol sales and gath­er­ings, will take ef­fect from today for four weeks. Work from home will be manda­tory wher­ever pos­si­ble. Bars in Brussels were al­ready closed last week.</p>
    <p>“By many mea­sures, the num­bers are worse than they were in March or April,” Mr de Croo said. “And I bring no good mes­sage: Those num­bers will likely keep ris­ing in the com­ing days.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Czech Repub­lic, which has the high­est Covid-19 in­fec­tion rate in Europe, will wait at least two weeks be­fore de­cid­ing whether to or­der a full lock­down, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Karel Havlicek said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In the past week, bars and restau­rants were or­dered to close ex­cept for take­out or­ders, and schools shifted to dis­tance learn­ing. Sport and fit­ness clubs, the­atres and cine­mas had al­ready been shut, but shops have re­mained open. Last Satur­day, the Czech Repub­lic re­ported 8,713 new coro­n­avirus cases, its largest daily to­tal at a week­end. Since schools re­opened last month, the cu­mu­la­tive num­ber of cases has risen al­most seven times.</p>
    <p>“We will not de­cide this week about a lock­down,” Mr Havlicek said on Czech Tele­vi­sion. “We have clearly said we will wait (un­til Nov 2) for re­sults.”</p>
    <p>Over in the French cap­i­tal Paris, which has been un­der a month-long night-time cur­few since last Satur­day evening, the streets were eerily empty overnight apart from a few strag­glers risk­ing a €135 (S$215) fine un­less they can pro­vide a cer­tifi­cate to show they have good rea­son to be out and about.</p>
    <p>Food de­liv­ery work­ers zigzagged the streets on bikes or scoot­ers, de­liv­er­ing meals to now home-bound din­ers in a city where it is com­mon to sit down to a meal af­ter 9pm. A hand­ful of mu­nic­i­pal buses cir­cu­lated with­out im­ped­i­ment down un­usu­ally car-free lanes, though mostly empty them­selves.</p>
    <p>Cur­fews are also in place in the cities of Lille, Lyon, Toulouse, Mont­pel­lier, Saint-Eti­enne, Aix-Mar­seille, Rouen and Greno­ble.</p>
    <p>Un­con­ven­tional arms, weapons of mass de­struc­tion and a buy­ing spree of con­ven­tional arms have no place in Iran’s de­fence doc­trine.</p>
    <p>IRAN’S FOR­EIGN MIN­ISTRY, on the ex­piry of the UN arms em­bargo yes­ter­day.</p>
