    <p>• There has been a deaf­en­ing si­lence among vic­tims of sex­ual abuse in Ja­pan, with the re­luc­tance to come for­ward born out of fear of pub­lic ridicule and scorn.</p>
    <p>This fear is per­pe­trated by opin­ions like those held by rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party law­maker, Ms Mio Sugita, 53, who in Septem­ber said at a party meet­ing to dis­cuss sup­port for sex­ual vi­o­lence vic­tims: “Women can tell lies as much as they want.”</p>
    <p>None­the­less, vic­tims are start­ing to raise their voices – the lat­est be­ing Ms Shoko Arai, 51, who was ousted from the Kusatsu town assem­bly af­ter go­ing pub­lic with al­le­ga­tions that she was sex­u­ally as­saulted by Mayor Nobu­tada Kuroiwa, 73.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times looks at other sex­ual ha­rass­ment cases in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>FACE OF #METOO MOVE­MENT</p>
    <p>Free­lance jour­nal­ist Shiori Ito, 31, was named in Time Mag­a­zine’s list of 100 most in­flu­en­tial peo­ple this year for be­ing the face of Ja­pan’s #MeToo move­ment.</p>
    <p>She pub­licly ac­cused high-pro­file reporter Noriyuki Ya­m­aguchi, 53, a bi­og­ra­pher of former prime min­is­ter Shinzo Abe, of rap­ing her. When pros­e­cu­tors de­clined to charge him, she took her fight to the civil court and won.</p>
    <p>In De­cem­ber last year, she was awarded 3.3 mi l l i o n yen ($42,300) in dam­ages by the Tokyo District Court, which also struck out a coun­ter­suit filed by Mr Ya­m­aguchi.</p>
    <p>TOP CIVIL SER­VANT RE­SIGNS</p>
    <p>Mr Ju­nichi Fukuda, 60, re­signed as the high­est-rank­ing civil ser­vant in the Fi­nance Min­istry in April 2018, fol­low­ing ac­cu­sa­tions he had ha­rassed fe­male jour­nal­ists by mak­ing lewd com­ments such as “Can I touch your breast?” and “Should we have an af­fair when the bud­get is en­acted?”</p>
    <p>He said the scan­dal had left him un­able to do his job.</p>
