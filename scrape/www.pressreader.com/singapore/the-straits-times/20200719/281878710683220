    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO • United States reg­u­la­tors may ques­tion Face­book chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Mark Zucker­berg and his right-hand ex­ec­u­tive to de­ter­mine if the so­cial net­work has bro­ken monopoly laws, ac­cord­ing to a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) re­port.</p>
    <p>The WSJ on Fri­day cited un­named peo­ple close to the mat­ter as say­ing the Fed­eral Trade Com­mis­sion (FTC) is con­sid­er­ing tak­ing sworn tes­ti­mony from Mr Zucker­berg and Face­book chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer Sh­eryl Sand­berg as part of a year-long probe into whether the lead­ing so­cial net­work has abused its dom­i­nance in the mar­ket. The FTC de­clined to dis­cuss the re­port.</p>
    <p>A Face­book spokesman said in re­sponse to an in­quiry from Agence France-Presse: “We look for­ward to shar­ing our views about the com­pet­i­tive land­scape, along with other tech­nol­ogy lead­ers, dur­ing this month’s con­gres­sional hear­ing, while also demon­strat­ing for en­force­ment agen­cies that our in­no­va­tion pro­vides more choices for con­sumers.”</p>
    <p>Lead­ers of Ama­zon, Ap­ple, Face­book and Google are to tes­tify dur­ing an an­titrust in­ves­ti­ga­tion hear­ing at the US House Com­mit­tee on the Ju­di­ciary on July 27.</p>
    <p>The hear­ing comes against a back­drop of grow­ing com­plaints about tech plat­forms that have dom­i­nated key eco­nomic sec­tors, as well as calls by some ac­tivists and politi­cians to break up the Sil­i­con Val­ley gi­ants.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tives Jeff Be­zos (Ama­zon), Tim Cook (Ap­ple), Sun­dar Pichai (Google) and Mr Zucker­berg can ap­pear vir­tu­ally if they wish, ac­cord­ing to a joint state­ment re­leased by ju­di­ciary com­mit­tee chair­man Jer­rold Nadler and an­titrust sub­com­mit­tee chair­man David Ci­cilline.</p>
    <p>“Since last June, the sub­com­mit­tee has been in­ves­ti­gat­ing the dom­i­nance of a small num­ber of dig­i­tal plat­forms and the ad­e­quacy of ex­ist­ing an­titrust laws and en­force­ment,” said Mr Nadler and Mr Ci­cilline.</p>
    <p>“Given the cen­tral role these cor­po­ra­tions play in the lives of the Amer­i­can peo­ple, it is crit­i­cal that their CEOs are forth­com­ing.”</p>
    <p>Google and Face­book, which ac­count for the bulk of dig­i­tal global advertisin­g rev­enue, pro­vide free ser­vices that have be­come dom­i­nant in their sec­tors, such as Google’s search en­gine or its videoshar­ing plat­form YouTube.</p>
    <p>Users’ in­ter­ac­tions with these prod­ucts al­low the com­pa­nies to col­lect data pro­files and sell tar­geted advertisin­g space on a mas­sive scale.</p>
    <p>At Ap­ple and Ama­zon, it is their sales plat­forms – the App Store on iPhones and iPads, or Ama­zon’s ecom­merce site – that are in the sights of reg­u­la­tors, since the two com­pa­nies are both hosts and mer­chants.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, the US Jus­tice De­part­ment said it was re­view­ing po­ten­tial anti-com­pet­i­tive ac­tions by ma­jor tech plat­forms, and at­tor­neys-gen­eral from the ma­jor­ity of US states have launched an­titrust in­ves­ti­ga­tions into Google and Face­book.</p>
