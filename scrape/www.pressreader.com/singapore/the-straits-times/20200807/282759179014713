    <p>On Tues­day, Beirut, the cap­i­tal of Le­banon, was struck by two mas­sive ex­plo­sions, which killed at least 135 peo­ple and wounded 5,000, ac­cord­ing to the coun­try’s health min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>The ex­plo­sion dis­placed more than 300,000 peo­ple from their homes and those re­ported miss­ing have risen to the hun­dreds, prompt­ing fears that the death toll will con­tinue to grow. The cause of the ex­plo­sion re­mains un­clear, ac­cord­ing to re­ports by The New York Times.</p>
    <p>The Le­banese Cab­i­net has de­clared a two-week state of emer­gency in the city.</p>
    <p>In the af­ter­math of the tragedy, celebri­ties are tak­ing to so­cial me­dia to spread aware­ness of the event, as well as to en­cour­age their so­cial me­dia fol­low­ing to send thoughts, prayers, and do­na­tions to the Mid­dle Eastern cap­i­tal, says USA To­day.</p>
    <p>Film ac­tress Salma Hayek shared a graphic video of the ex­plo­sions on her In­sta­gram ac­count on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The 53-year-old wrote: “To­day two ex­plo­sions dev­as­tated the cap­i­tal of the al­ready hurt­ing Le­banon. My bro­ken heart goes out to all the peo­ple who have lost loved ones and who are in the af­fected ar­eas of my beloved Beirut.”</p>
    <p>Other celebri­ties, in­clud­ing Ari­ana Grande, have urged their fol­low­ers to do­nate.</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old singer, in a tweet on Tues­day, wrote: “My heart, strength and con­do­lences are with Le­banon and ev­ery­one af­fected by this tragedy.”</p>
    <p>She also di­rected her fol­low­ers to sup­port two dis­as­ter re­lief or­gan­i­sa­tions – a crowd­fun­der on global on­line so­cial plat­form, Just­Giv­ing, as well as the Le­banese Red Cross.</p>
    <p>Ac­tress Jameela Jamil has also taken to so­cial me­dia to share more about the tragedy. She shared a link to a fund on Twit­ter, as well as an im­age that listed or­gan­i­sa­tions to do­nate to.</p>
    <p>The Good Place ac­tress wrote: “A pandemic, po­lit­i­cal un­rest and now 300,000 peo­ple left home­less due to the blast. Beirut needs global sup­port.”</p>
    <p>Other celebri­ties, in­clud­ing singer Halsey, model Naomi Camp­bell and ac­tress Priyanka Cho­pra, have been speak­ing about the Beirut blast on their so­cial me­dia han­dles.</p>
