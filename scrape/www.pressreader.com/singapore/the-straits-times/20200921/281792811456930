    <p>WASHINGTON/NEW YORK • United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has given his bless­ing to Or­a­cle Corp’s bid for the Amer­i­can op­er­a­tions of TikTok, putting the pop­u­lar video-shar­ing app on course to es­cape a US ban im­posed over se­cu­rity con­cerns.</p>
    <p>“I ap­proved the deal in con­cept,” Mr Trump told re­porters on Satur­day as he left the White House for a cam­paign rally i n Fayet­teville, North Carolina.</p>
    <p>“If they get it done, that’s great. If they don’t, that’s OK too.”</p>
    <p>The new com­pany, which will be called TikTok Global, has agreed to fun­nel US$5 bil­lion (S$6.8 bil­lion) in new tax dol­lars to the US and set up a new ed­u­ca­tion fund, which Mr Trump said would sat­isfy his de­mand that the gov­ern­ment re­ceive a pay­ment from the deal.</p>
    <p>“They’re go­ing to be set­ting up a very large fund... That’s their con­tri­bu­tion that I’ve been ask­ing for,” he said.</p>
    <p>Or­a­cle will take a 12.5 per cent stake in TikTok Global, while Wal­mart said it has ten­ta­tively agreed to buy 7.5 per cent of the en­tity. The two com­pa­nies would pay a com­bined US$12 bil­lion for their stakes if they agree to that ask­ing price.</p>
    <p>Sources said TikTok’s Chi­nese owner ByteDance is seek­ing a val­u­a­tion of US$60 bil­lion for TikTok.</p>
    <p>Wal­mart’s chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Doug McMil­lon will serve on TikTok Global’s board of di­rec­tors, the re­tailer said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Four of the five board seats will be filled by Amer­i­cans, ac­cord­ing to the state­ment.</p>
    <p>The deal was forced by a pair of bans Mr Trump is­sued last month over con­cerns about the data that</p>
    <p>US cit­i­zens pro­vide to ByteDance and the po­ten­tial for Bei­jing to use it for spy­ing.</p>
    <p>Shortly af­ter Mr Trump sig­nalled his ap­proval, the US Com­merce Depart­ment on Satur­day de­layed by a week a ban that would have forced Ap­ple and Google to pull the TikTok video app from their US app stores yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>TikTok said in a state­ment that it was “pleased that the pro­posal by TikTok, Or­a­cle and Wal­mart will re­solve the se­cu­rity con­cerns of the US ad­min­is­tra­tion and set­tle ques­tions around TikTok’s fu­ture in the US”.</p>
    <p>The com­pany con­firmed that Or­a­cle will host all its US data and se­cure its com­puter sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Or­a­cle’s Gen­er­a­tion 2 Cloud fully iso­lates run­ning ap­pli­ca­tions and re­sponds to se­cu­rity threats au­tonomously, ac­cord­ing to the state­ment, which elim­i­nates the risk of for­eign gov­ern­ments spy­ing on Amer­i­can users or try­ing to in­flu­ence them with dis­in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>“Or­a­cle will quickly de­ploy, rapidly scale, and op­er­ate TikTok sys­tems in the Or­a­cle Cloud,” said Or­a­cle CEO Safra Catz in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Or­a­cle will get full ac­cess to re­view TikTok’s source code and up­dates to make sure there are no back doors used by the com­pany’s Chi­nese par­ent to gather data or to spy on the video-shar­ing app’s 100 mil­lion Amer­i­can users, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>TikTok Global, to­gether with Or­a­cle, Susque­hanna In­ter­na­tional Group, Gen­eral At­lantic, Se­quoia Cap­i­tal, Wal­mart and Coatue Man­age­ment, will cre­ate an ed­u­ca­tional ini­tia­tive to de­velop and de­liver an on­line video cur­ricu­lum driven by ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI), ac­cord­ing to the state­ment.</p>
    <p>To sweeten the deal for Mr Trump, TikTok also promised to hire for an ad­di­tional 15,000 jobs, more than the 10,000 po­si­tions the com­pany al­ready pledged to fill ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>ByteDance said in a so­cial me­dia post that it was the first time it had heard in the news that it was set­ting up a US$5 bil­lion ed­u­ca­tion fund in the US.</p>
    <p>“The com­pany has been com­mit­ted to in­vest­ing in the ed­u­ca­tion field, and plans to work with part­ners and global share­hold­ers to launch on­line class­room projects based on AI and video tech­nol­ogy for stu­dents around the world,” ByteDance said on its of­fi­cial ac­count on Toutiao.</p>
    <p>Early re­ac­tion from Chi­nese state me­dia ap­peared pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>“This scheme is still un­fair, but it avoids the worst re­sult, that Tik</p>
    <p>Tok is shut down or sold to a US com­pany com­pletely,” wrote Mr Hu Xijin, the in­flu­en­tial ed­i­tor-inchief of China’s state-owned Global Times.</p>
