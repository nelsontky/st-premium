    <p>Two work­ers died in work­place ac­ci­dents this week, prompt­ing labour move­ment NTUC to urge com­pa­nies to pri­ori­tise and safe­guard the safety of work­ers, and not to put their lives at risk by rush­ing to catch up on work.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, NTUC as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Melvin Yong said there were five work­place fa­tal­i­ties over the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>He added that to date, the num­ber of work­place fa­tal­i­ties this year is more than two-thirds of the to­tal last year, when 39 lives were lost.</p>
    <p>“This is against the back­drop of Covid-19 re­stric­tions, where there was a dras­tic drop in the level of busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties,” he noted.</p>
    <p>Ex­press­ing his con­cern and alarm over the sharp in­crease in the past two weeks, Mr Yong said the fig­ures serve as a crit­i­cal re­minder of the need to guard against fa­tigue or even com­pla­cency as Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to move to­wards phase three of its re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>He said he was glad that the Work­place Safety and Health (WSH) Coun­cil and the Sin­ga­pore Con­trac­tors As­so­ci­a­tion called on con­struc­tion firms to con­duct a safety time-out last week.</p>
    <p>The WSH Coun­cil pro­vided de­tails of the lat­est in­ci­dents in an up­date yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The first ac­ci­dent hap­pened on Tues­day, when a worker pack­ing goods in a ware­house fell from a height and later died in hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>The next day, a worker re­pair­ing a ma­chine died af­ter one of its parts fell on him. He was pro­nounced dead at the scene.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power has com­menced in­ves­ti­ga­tions into both in­ci­dents, said the WSH Coun­cil on its web­site.</p>
    <p>In his post, Mr Yong called for trained WSH rep­re­sen­ta­tives in ev­ery or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>These rep­re­sen­ta­tives could also en­sure that the im­ple­men­ta­tion of safe man­age­ment mea­sures at the work­place to stem the spread of Covid-19 does not com­pro­mise on work­place safety.</p>
    <p>Mr Yong said com­pa­nies should also con­sider im­ple­ment­ing a struc­tured re­ori­en­ta­tion pro­gramme for work­ers re­turn­ing to the work­place af­ter be­ing away for a pro­longed pe­riod.</p>
    <p>This ap­plies es­pe­cially to high-risk sec­tors such as man­u­fac­tur­ing, con­struc­tion, trans­porta­tion and stor­age.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers should also con­sider con­duct­ing re­fresher WSH cour­ses so that safety re­mains at the top of ev­ery­one’s minds, he added.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Yong: “At the end of the day, work­place safety is ev­ery­one’s re­spon­si­bil­ity. Each of us must play our part as we strive to­wards a safer and health­ier work­place for all.”</p>
    <p>At the end of the day, work­place safety is ev­ery­one’s re­spon­si­bil­ity. Each of us must play our part as we strive to­wards a safer and health­ier work­place for all.</p>
