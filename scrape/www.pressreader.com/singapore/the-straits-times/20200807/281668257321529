    <p>Tri­als for a po­ten­tial treat­ment for Covid-19 are be­ing ac­cel­er­ated, with the third and fi­nal phase for the drug due to start in a few weeks’ time.</p>
    <p>De­vel­oped by Sin­ga­pore-based biotech­nol­ogy com­pany Ty­chan, the mon­o­clonal an­ti­body – or im­mune sys­tem pro­tein – known as TY027 will be tested on 500 re­cently di­ag­nosed Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The trial is ex­pected to take a few months, but is the fi­nal step be­fore the drug can be ap­proved for treat­ment here.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong from Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School, who is one of the founders of Ty­chan, told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that as a small com­pany, Ty­chan does not have the re­sources to run tri­als with thou­sands of pa­tients. But if the re­sults are dra­matic, there is a chance that fewer than 500 pa­tients would suf­fice.</p>
    <p>“We have to be tighter in how we re­cruit and the kind of pa­tients that we en­rol. The key cri­te­rion is for the pa­tients to be in the first seven days of ill­ness,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Lim­it­ing the kind of pa­tients we can en­rol would give our­selves the best chance of show­ing, in as short a time as pos­si­ble and in as few pa­tients as pos­si­ble, that this drug works to pre­vent se­vere Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>Mon­o­clonal an­ti­bod­ies are im­mune sys­tem pro­teins that are cre­ated in the lab­o­ra­tory, and can be spe­cially de­signed and en­gi­neered to tar­get Sars-CoV-2.</p>
    <p>The ad­van­tage is that these an­ti­bod­ies can be de­vel­oped over sev­eral months and pro­duced in large batches. A sin­gle in­jec­tion may last for a few weeks.</p>
    <p>Half of the 500 pa­tients will re­ceive a placebo in the dou­ble-blind trial so that the drug’s ef­fec­tive­ness can be tested, said Prof Ooi. Ty­chan will work with hospi­tals un­der SingHealth to re­cruit the pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The re­cruit­ment process has not started yet be­cause the fi­nal trial is pend­ing ap­proval from the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Ty­chan will pay for tests and clinic vis­its be­yond the stan­dard med­i­cal care pro­vided to the trial par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>In the best-case sce­nario, TY027 could be ap­proved as a drug treat­ment for Covid-19 by early next year, or even ear­lier, said Prof Ooi, who is deputy direc­tor of the Emerg­ing In­fec­tious Dis­eases Pro­gramme at Duke-NUS.</p>
    <p>Clin­i­cal tri­als are com­monly con­ducted in four phases, be­gin­ning with a small group to test the drug’s safety and side ef­fects, then mov­ing on to larger groups to de­ter­mine its ef­fi­cacy.</p>
    <p>Usu­ally, in phase three, what is be­ing tested is whether the drug works as in­tended in pre­vent­ing disease or ac­cel­er­at­ing re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>TY027 is be­ing ex­plored for the treat­ment of Covid-19 pa­tients in slow­ing the pro­gres­sion of the disease and speed­ing up re­cov­ery, as well as po­ten­tially pro­vid­ing tem­po­rary pro­tec­tion against in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>A six-week phase one trial in June with 23 healthy vol­un­teers yielded good out­comes in terms of safety, said Prof Ooi.</p>
    <p>He added: “The safety pro­file has been ex­cel­lent, there’s min­i­mal side ef­fects... And the re­sults have been very, very en­cour­ag­ing.”</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing on the de­vel­op­ment, in­fec­tious dis­eases spe­cial­ist Hsu Li Yang from the Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health said whether Ty­chan’s drug would be ef­fec­tive will de­pend on clin­i­cal trial re­sults, par­tic­u­larly in phase three.</p>
    <p>“Cur­rently, it’s good that the drug is proven safe. An ef­fec­tive treat­ment, how­ever, does not re­duce the scale of an out­break, al­though it will blunt the im­pact in terms of death and disability,” he said, adding that the only ef­fec­tive treat­ment now for se­vere Covid-19 is dex­am­etha­sone, a steroid drug.</p>
