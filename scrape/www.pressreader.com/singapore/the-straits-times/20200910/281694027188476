    <p>The re­cent sus­pen­sion of As­traZeneca’s Covid-19 vac­cine trial fol­low­ing an un­ex­plained ill­ness in a trial vol­un­teer is a safety mea­sure and not an un­com­mon oc­cur­rence, said the Health Min­istry’s di­rec­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices Ken­neth Mak yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish-Swedish phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany an­nounced the sus­pen­sion yes­ter­day, adding that the move was in­tended to give re­searchers time to ex­am­ine safety data while main­tain­ing the in­tegrity of the tri­als.</p>
    <p>Its vac­cine, which is be­ing de­vel­oped with re­searchers from the Univer­sity of Ox­ford, has been viewed as one of the world’s lead­ing can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to queries about the in­ci­dent at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Mak, who is part of the multi-min­istry task force fight­ing Covid-19 in Sin­ga­pore, added that such an in­ci­dent could oc­cur “very eas­ily” with any other vac­cine.</p>
    <p>“This is why we’ve al­ways been shar­ing that the road to­wards vac­cine de­vel­op­ment is long and can be dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>“Just be­cause we have sev­eral vac­cine can­di­dates that have en­gaged in Phase III tri­als does not nec­es­sar­ily im­ply that we will have a vac­cine ready for use in the im­me­di­ate fu­ture,” he said, adding that the au­thor­i­ties here are wait­ing for more in­for­ma­tion be­fore as­sess­ing the safety and ef­fi­cacy of As­traZeneca’s vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Prof Mak said that the au­thor­i­ties are en­gag­ing com­pa­nies with the aim of bring­ing promis­ing Covid-19 vac­cines to Sin­ga­pore in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>But he added: “We want to be sure that the vac­cines we bring in will be safe, will be able to de­liver on the prom­ise that they have, and (that) they will be ef­fec­tive as well.”</p>
    <p>He also high­lighted at­tempts to pro­duce a vac­cine here, cit­ing one that is be­ing jointly de­vel­oped by Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School and United States phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics.</p>
    <p>Known as Lu­nar-Cov19, the vac­cine is cur­rently in clin­i­cal tri­als, with the first group of lo­cal vol­un­teers here dosed last month.</p>
    <p>World­wide, it is one of 34 can­di­date Covid-19 vac­cines cur­rently in clin­i­cal tri­als.</p>
    <p>“We con­tinue to wait for the re­sults of these stud­ies, and we look for­ward to promis­ing vac­cine can­di­dates be­ing de­vel­oped and brought into com­mer­cial de­vel­op­ment and made avail­able to the en­tire pop­u­la­tion,” said Prof Mak.</p>
    <p>But Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong, who was also at the press con­fer­ence, cau­tioned: “It’s im­por­tant for us to bear in mind that while we re­main hope­ful that a vac­cine will come one day, in the mean­time, we have to con­tinue to be vig­i­lant and en­sure that our safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures are in place... We need ev­ery­one to work to­gether to keep Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore­ans safe.”</p>
    <p>Late-stage hu­man tri­als for a lead­ing Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­date have been paused af­ter a par­tic­i­pant fell ill, but ex­perts con­tend it is still too soon to say if the vac­cine caused the ill­ness.</p>
    <p>“This is how clin­i­cal tri­als work,” said Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong, deputy di­rec­tor of Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School’s emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the start of every clin­i­cal trial, sci­en­tists and clin­i­cians will first de­fine a list of “se­ri­ous ad­verse events”, he ex­plained.</p>
    <p>“This could in­clude hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion or death from any cause – in­clud­ing a road traf­fic ac­ci­dent.”</p>
    <p>Once the tri­als com­mence, the oc­cur­rence of any of the events on the pre-de­fined list would be enough to cause a pause in the trial as the re­searchers un­der­take a full re­view of the sit­u­a­tion, said Prof Ooi.</p>
    <p>“In this case, we need to wait for more data be­fore we can know if the vac­cine had caused this out­come.”</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 vac­cine, which phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany As­traZeneca is de­vel­op­ing with the Univer­sity of Ox­ford, is con­sid­ered one of the lead­ing can­di­dates. The drug­maker said in a state­ment that the vol­un­tary pause is a rou­tine ac­tion which has to hap­pen when­ever there is po­ten­tially un­ex­plained ill­ness in any trial as it is be­ing in­ves­ti­gated.</p>
    <p>The firm did not give de­tails about the case but The New York Times re­ported that it was a vol­un­teer in the Bri­tish tri­als, who was di­ag­nosed with trans­verse myeli­tis, an in­flam­ma­tion of the spinal cord gen­er­ally caused by in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent raised ques­tions about whether the speed of the search for a Covid-19 vac­cine had led to any com­pro­mise in safety pro­ce­dures.</p>
    <p>But this is not nec­es­sar­ily the case, said Prof Ooi, a co-de­vel­oper of a Covid-19 vac­cine cur­rently un­der­go­ing early-stage hu­man tri­als in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Ac­cel­er­at­ing vac­cine de­vel­op­ment does not mean that safety mea­sures are fore­gone,” he said.</p>
    <p>It is the ad­vent of new tech­nol­ogy, such as molec­u­lar tools, that al­low sci­en­tists to eval­u­ate the safety and ef­fi­cacy of a vac­cine even be­fore it reaches the hu­man trial stage.</p>
    <p>“That makes it eas­ier to move it along faster. But there are no short­cuts in the clin­i­cal trial process.”</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health’s di­rec­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices Ken­neth Mak told a press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day the pause in the trial is a safety mea­sure that is not un­com­mon in many tri­als.</p>
    <p>“This can oc­cur very eas­ily with any other vac­cine. And this is why we’ve al­ways been shar­ing that the road to­wards vac­cine de­vel­op­ment is long and can be dif­fi­cult,” said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Mak.</p>
    <p>“We con­tinue to watch very closely the con­duct of these stud­ies to make sure the vac­cine can­di­dates that are cur­rently promis­ing re­ally can de­liver on their po­ten­tial.”</p>
