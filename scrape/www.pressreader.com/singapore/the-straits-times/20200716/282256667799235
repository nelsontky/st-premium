    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy is head­ing out of the Covid-19 dol­drums and will con­tinue to re­open and re­cover, but job losses are likely to per­sist.</p>
    <p>With the fun­da­men­tal cause of the slump – the curbs im­posed to con­tain the coro­n­avirus – largely re­moved, eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity in Sin­ga­pore is set to im­prove.</p>
    <p>The im­pact of the crush­ing blow from the April to May cir­cuit breaker in Sin­ga­pore and lock­downs else­where was laid bare this week, in the ad­vance growth es­ti­mates for the sec­ond quar­ter by the Min­istry of Trade and</p>
    <p>In­dus­try (MTI).</p>
    <p>The econ­omy shrank by</p>
    <p>12.6 per cent year on year in the</p>
    <p>April to June pe­riod, and by a record 41.2 per cent quar­ter on quar­ter.</p>
    <p>With the re­sump­tion of busi­ness and mo­bil­ity – amid re­lax­ation of con­tain­ment mea­sures on June 1 and a swift move to phase two within 19 days of that date – pre­vi­ously shut ledger books at shops and fac­to­ries would have started to record trans­ac­tions that make up a na­tion’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP).</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the June pur­chas­ing man­agers’ in­dex read­ing marked the fifth month of con­trac­tion for the over­all man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor.</p>
    <p>But it was above the level in April, when the gauge of in­dus­trial ac­tiv­ity dropped to the low­est level since Novem­ber 2008, which was dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>While in­creas­ing GDP will re­sult in smaller growth con­trac­tions in sub­se­quent quar­ters, un­em­ploy­ment may still con­tinue to rise as key sec­tors such as con­struc­tion and ser­vices – es­pe­cially re­tail, tourism and travel – will re­main lethar­gic, at best, given that most travel curbs are still in place.</p>
    <p>The con­struc­tion sec­tor shrank by 54.7 per cent year on year, a sig­nif­i­cant de­te­ri­o­ra­tion from the 1.1 per cent de­cline in the first quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The sub­dued do­mes­tic sec­tors will limit the ex­tent of the re­bound in pri­vate con­sump­tion, while lin­ger­ing sup­ply chain dis­rup­tions and trade con­flicts – such as</p>
    <p>United States-China ten­sions – will check sig­nif­i­cant gains in ex­ports.</p>
    <p>The above fac­tors are prob­a­bly why the MTI has not re­vised its May fore­cast of a full-year con­trac­tion of 4 per cent to 7 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ris­ing un­em­ploy­ment in an econ­omy that is grow­ing out of a re­ces­sion is termed a hys­tere­sis event.</p>
    <p>This refers to the phe­nom­e­non of an eco­nomic event or trend per­sist­ing even af­ter the fac­tors that led to it have been re­moved.</p>
    <p>Most re­ces­sions give way to hys­tere­sis, and that is why the trough of an eco­nomic cy­cle – which marks the be­gin­ning of the end of a re­ces­sion – is con­sid­ered the trick­i­est part for pol­i­cy­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>DBS Bank es­ti­mates res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment ris­ing to 4.2 per cent, which im­plies that as many as 97,800 res­i­dents could be out of a job by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>In com­par­i­son, there were 72,900 job losses last year.</p>
    <p>The bur­den of em­ploy­ment in Sin­ga­pore is mainly borne by the ser­vice sec­tor, of which re­tail – for ex­am­ple, malls, shops, restau­rants, theme parks and casi­nos – is a sig­nif­i­cant com­po­nent.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that in­te­grated re­sort op­er­a­tor Re­sorts World Sen­tosa will be lay­ing off a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of staff, ow­ing to the im­pact on tourism brought about by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The ser­vice sec­tor was the first to go un­der – even be­fore the cir­cuit breaker was im­posed – af­ter ev­i­dence of tourists in­fect­ing lo­cals with Covid-19 pro­voked travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional travel is, of course, the start­ing point for tourism re­ceipts and a large chunk of re­tail sales here.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board, vis­i­tor ar­rivals in the first five months of the year were down 65.7 per cent, with only 900 ar­rivals in May.</p>
    <p>In May alone, re­tail sales plum­meted 52.1 per cent, a record con­trac­tion since the data was made pub­lic in 1985.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Mr Irvin Seah, se­nior econ­o­mist at DBS, tourism and avi­a­tion could po­ten­tially take more than two years to re­cover to pre-Covid-19 lev­els in terms of real GDP.</p>
    <p>With travel re­stric­tions likely to per­sist, the con­struc­tion sec­tor, which is rather over-re­liant on for­eign man­power, will con­tinue to face labour crunches.</p>
    <p>The sec­tor also has to bear the still-preva­lent re­stric­tive mea­sures at work sites.</p>
    <p>Even man­u­fac­tur­ing, which was the only sec­tor that recorded an ex­pan­sion in the sec­ond quar­ter, is run­ning mainly on a sin­gle engine – the biomed­i­cal clus­ter.</p>
    <p>Within the clus­ter, pro­duc­tion of phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals has ex­panded for five straight months this year.</p>
    <p>There has been in­creased de­mand for med­i­cal goods that is due to the pan­demic as well. This could con­tinue to sup­port growth in Sin­ga­pore’s non-elec­tronic non-oil do­mes­tic ex­ports.</p>
    <p>How­ever, for most of man­u­fac­tur­ing and ex­ports, geopo­lit­i­cal and trade ten­sions will re­main a drag.</p>
    <p>Re­la­tions be­tween the world’s two largest economies – the US and China – con­tinue to de­te­ri­o­rate, with dis­agree­ments emerg­ing on ev­ery­thing from the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion to telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions, trade and the re­cent na­tional se­cu­rity law en­acted in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>As the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment has al­ready pumped in $92.9 bil­lion in four stim­u­lus pack­ages, the bar for fur­ther fis­cal sup­port for jobs and busi­nesses is quite high.</p>
    <p>But if re­trench­ments con­tinue to in­crease, the Gov­ern­ment may have to ex­tend some of the bud­getary mea­sures on job se­cu­rity that are set to ex­pire in the com­ing months. For in­stance, the Jobs Sup­port Scheme is set to ex­pire in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>The labour mar­ket typ­i­cally lags be­hind GDP growth by about three to six months, as com­pa­nies try to hold on to their work­ers for as long as pos­si­ble, and are wary of hir­ing in a new growth cy­cle.</p>
    <p>Given that busi­ness con­di­tions are likely to re­main tough, com­pa­nies may need to cut ex­penses to en­sure their sur­vival in a slow re­cov­ery. That means the labour mar­ket has yet to see its worst lev­els.</p>
    <p>Job losses, pay cuts and a slow­down in hir­ing may tran­spire more strongly later this year.</p>
    <p>The threat of a sub­se­quent wave of Covid-19 in­fec­tions is, of course, a per­sis­tent risk in the ab­sence of a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion re­cently warned that the dis­ease is un­likely to dis­ap­pear in the com­ing months, and that it is un­re­al­is­tic to ex­pect a per­fect vac­cine any time soon.</p>
    <p>Still, gov­ern­ments across the world have shown hes­i­tance to reim­pose strict and large-scale lock­downs, since they now un­der­stand the eco­nomic cost of do­ing so, es­pe­cially in terms of liveli­hoods.</p>
    <p>With Covid-19 in­fec­tions cross­ing the 13 mil­lion mark, smaller and more tar­geted mea­sures are more likely – a re­sponse that will keep the global econ­omy and Sin­ga­pore chug­ging on their way to re­cov­ery, al­beit at a mod­est pace.</p>
    <p>Given that busi­ness con­di­tions are likely to re­main tough, com­pa­nies may need to cut ex­penses to en­sure their sur­vival in a slow re­cov­ery. That means the labour mar­ket has yet to see its worst lev­els.</p>
