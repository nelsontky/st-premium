    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) has sus­pended the work pass priv­i­leges of two em­ploy­ers for fail­ing to ar­range for their work­ers to un­dergo ros­tered rou­tine test­ing for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>This means they will no longer be able to con­tinue em­ploy­ing the two work­ers, and can­not hire any new work­ers through the work pass sys­tem un­til the sus­pen­sion is lifted.</p>
    <p>MOM, the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board, Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Author­ity and Health Pro­mo­tion Board said in a joint state­ment yes­ter­day: “The af­fected work­ers have been given a grace pe­riod to look for al­ter­na­tive em­ploy­ment as they were not com­plicit with the breach of re­quire­ments.”</p>
    <p>MOM took ac­tion af­ter the em­ploy­ers failed to pro­vide valid rea­sons or sub­mit an ex­emp­tion re­quest for their work­ers, the state­ment said. Both em­ploy­ers had failed to send one worker each for test­ing, the state­ment added.</p>
    <p>Since Sept 5, it has be­come com­pul­sory for em­ploy­ers to send their work­ers for test­ing, and most work­ers from a pool of about 260,000 who were re­quired to get tested have ei­ther un­der­gone test­ing or are sched­uled to do so.</p>
    <p>About 2,200 work­ers – who are re­quired to un­dergo test­ing but have not done so – can­not re­turn to work un­til they get tested as their ac­cess code sta­tus will re­main red.</p>
    <p>Work­ers can also have a red ac­cess code for three other rea­sons: If they are placed on pre­cau­tion­ary quar­an­tine while their ex­po­sure to a pos­i­tive case is un­der probe, if they no longer have the TraceTo­gether app in­stalled on their mo­bile phone or if they are re­quired to un­dergo test­ing but did not do so.</p>
    <p>Work­ers must have a green ac­cess code, which they can show on their phones, be­fore they are al­lowed to re­turn to work.</p>
    <p>MOM said it will con­tinue to take ac­tion against er­rant em­ploy­ers or work­ers who per­sis­tently fail to sched­ule or at­tend ros­tered rou­tine test­ing ses­sions with­out valid rea­sons.</p>
    <p>Penal­ties in­clude the re­vo­ca­tion of work passes and sus­pen­sion of work pass priv­i­leges.</p>
