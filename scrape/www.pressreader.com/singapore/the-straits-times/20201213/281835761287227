    <p>BEI­JING • The Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties have de­tained a Chi­nese na­tional work­ing for the Bloomberg News bureau in Bei­jing on suspicion of en­dan­ger­ing na­tional se­cu­rity, said the news agency and China’s For­eign Min­istry.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a Bloomberg re­port, Ms Haze Fan was seen be­ing es­corted from her apart­ment build­ing by plain-clothes se­cu­rity of­fi­cials on Mon­day, shortly af­ter she had been in con­tact with one of her edi­tors.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry said in re­sponse to a Reuters query on Fri­day: “Chi­nese ci­ti­zen Ms Fan has been de­tained by the Bei­jing Na­tional Se­cu­rity Bureau ac­cord­ing to rel­e­vant Chi­nese law on suspicion of en­gag­ing in crim­i­nal ac­tiv­i­ties that jeop­ar­dise na­tional se­cu­rity.”</p>
    <p>The min­istry added: “The case is cur­rently un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion. Ms Fan’s le­git­i­mate rights have been fully en­sured and her fam­ily has been no­ti­fied.”</p>
    <p>The Bei­jing Na­tional Se­cu­rity Bureau could not im­me­di­ately be reached for com­ment.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for New York-based Bloomberg said in an e-mailed state­ment to Reuters: “We are very con­cerned for her, and have been ac­tively speak­ing to Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties to bet­ter un­der­stand the sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Added the spokesman: “We are con­tin­u­ing to do ev­ery­thing we can to sup­port her while we seek more in­for­ma­tion.”</p>
    <p>Bloomberg ed­i­tor-in-chief John Mick­leth­wait and other se­nior edi­tors told China-based staff that the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties said Ms Fan had not been de­tained in re­la­tion to her work, the Wall Street Jour­nal re­ported, cit­ing un­named sources.</p>
    <p>Ms Fan has been at Bloomberg since 2017 and pre­vi­ously worked for Reuters, CNBC, Al Jazeera and CBS News, ac­cord­ing to her LinkedIn pro­file.</p>
    <p>China has ex­pelled more than a dozen for­eign jour­nal­ists at US me­dia or­gan­i­sa­tions this year by can­celling their press cre­den­tials as its re­la­tions with Wash­ing­ton have wors­ened.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, the au­thor­i­ties in Bei­jing de­tained jour­nal­ist Cheng Lei, a China-born Aus­tralian ci­ti­zen work­ing for the Chi­nese state-run broad­caster China Global Tele­vi­sion Net­work, on suspicion of ac­tiv­i­ties that en­dan­gered na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, the Aus­tralian gov­ern­ment helped two Aus­tralian for­eign cor­re­spon­dents to leave China af­ter they were ques­tioned by China’s State Se­cu­rity Min­istry.</p>
    <p>Bloomberg ed­i­tor-in-chief John Mick­leth­wait and other se­nior edi­tors told China-based staff that the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties said Ms Haze Fan had not been de­tained in re­la­tion to her work.</p>
