    <p>The United Na­tions’ refugee agency said Malaysia has not al­lowed it to meet de­tained refugees and asy­lum seek­ers for more than a year as the coun­try cracks down on un­doc­u­mented mi­grants, rais­ing con­cerns over the sta­tus of vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The United Na­tions High Com­mis­sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) pre­vi­ously vis­ited the cen­tres to de­ter­mine who should be given refugee sta­tus and al­lowed to leave, but Malaysia’s gov­ern­ment tough­ened its stance on im­mi­gra­tion this year.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of un­doc­u­mented for­eign­ers have been rounded up in what the au­thor­i­ties say are ef­forts to stop the spread of the coro­n­avirus, and the state-funded Na­tional Hu­man Rights Com­mis­sion said it was con­cerned about over­crowd­ing in the lock-ups.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s Im­mi­gra­tion Depart­ment, which runs the de­ten­tion cen­tres, did not re­spond to re­quests for com­ment.</p>
    <p>The Home Af­fairs Min­istry did not have an im­me­di­ate com­ment.</p>
    <p>The UNHCR told Reuters yes­ter­day that it had not been al­lowed to visit the cen­tres since Au­gust last year. It did not say why, cit­ing on­go­ing dis­cus­sions.</p>
    <p>“This has un­for­tu­nately pre­vented UNHCR from see­ing de­tained per­sons of con­cern in or­der to de­ter­mine those in need of in­ter­na­tional pro­tec­tion and to ad­vo­cate for their re­lease,” the UNHCR told Reuters in e-mailed com­ments yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We are aware and con­cerned that there re­mains in de­ten­tion a num­ber of per­sons of con­cern, in­clud­ing vul­ner­a­ble in­di­vid­u­als, re­quir­ing our at­ten­tion.”</p>
    <p>Malaysia is home to mil­lions of un­doc­u­mented for­eign­ers and over 100,000 Ro­hingya refugees flee­ing per­se­cu­tion in Myan­mar and from camps in Bangladesh.</p>
    <p>Although Malaysia does not recog­nise refugees, it al­lows free move­ment to those given pro­tec­tion by the UNHCR.</p>
    <p>The agency was able to reg­is­ter 6,039 in­di­vid­u­als as asy­lum seek­ers by last month, com­pared with 27,323 through all of last year, the agency said.</p>
    <p>Among those it had not been able to see were hun­dreds of Ro­hingya ar­rested af­ter months at sea.</p>
    <p>“Refugees and asy­lum seek­ers like the Ro­hingya have no op­por­tu­nity to be re­leased with­out the UNHCR,” said Mr Jer­ald Joseph, a com­mis­sioner with the Na­tional Hu­man Rights Com­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Joseph es­ti­mated that more than 1,000 asy­lum seek­ers were in de­ten­tion camps, which he be­lieved to be home to a third more peo­ple than the 12,500 they had been built for.</p>
    <p>The oth­ers in the lock-ups are un­doc­u­mented for­eign­ers await­ing de­por­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 out­breaks have been re­ported from at least five of the de­ten­tion cen­tres, and more than 1,000 have been af­fected in th­ese clus­ters.</p>
    <p>Rights groups and de­tainees have said the con­di­tions in the de­ten­tion camps were bru­tal.</p>
    <p>Last month, In­done­sia’s Sov­er­eign Mi­grant Work­ers Coali­tion cited for­mer de­tainees as say­ing they had been treated like an­i­mals and hosed down with dis­in­fec­tant af­ter a Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>One for­mer de­tainee, an In­done­sian woman who was re­leased in Jan­uary, told Reuters hun­dreds of de­tainees were tightly packed in a room, in­clud­ing the old, sick, preg­nant women and chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Food was in­ad­e­quate and an of­fi­cial hit the de­tainees, she added.</p>
    <p>“It was like all the de­tainees in the im­mi­gra­tion de­ten­tion cen­tre were not hu­mans,” she said.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have in the past ac­knowl­edged that con­di­tions at the mi­grant lock-ups could be im­proved.</p>
