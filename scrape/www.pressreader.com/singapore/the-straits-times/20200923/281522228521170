    <p>Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son has re­vealed new re­stric­tions that could last six months and told peo­ple to work from home if pos­si­ble, say­ing the coun­try is at a “per­ilous turn­ing point” for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Un­der new mea­sures an­nounced yes­ter­day for Eng­land, face cov­er­ings will be­come manda­tory for pas­sen­gers trav­el­ling in taxis and work­ers in the hos­pi­tal­ity and re­tail sec­tors, with tougher fines for peo­ple fail­ing to wear masks.</p>
    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son has told peo­ple to work from home where pos­si­ble and or­dered bars and restau­rants to close early to tackle a fast-spread­ing sec­ond wave of Covid-19, with curbs last­ing prob­a­bly six months.</p>
    <p>Af­ter gov­ern­ment sci­en­tists cau­tioned that deaths may soar with­out ur­gent ac­tion, Mr John­son stopped short of an­other full lock­down as he did in March, but said fur­ther ac­tion could be taken if the disease was not sup­pressed.</p>
    <p>“We re­serve the right to de­ploy greater fire­power, with sig­nif­i­cantly greater re­stric­tions,” he told Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day fol­low­ing emer­gency meet­ings with min­is­ters and lead­ers of the United King­dom’s de­volved gov­ern­ments.</p>
    <p>Just weeks af­ter urg­ing peo­ple to start re­turn­ing to their work­places, Mr John­son ad­vised of­fice work­ers to stay at home if they could.</p>
    <p>He or­dered all pubs, bars, restau­rants and other hos­pi­tal­ity sites to close at 10pm from to­mor­row, with only ta­ble ser­vice al­lowed.</p>
    <p>“I am sorry this will hurt many busi­nesses j ust getting back on their feet,” he said.</p>
    <p>It was un­clear if the mea­sures would be enough to tackle Bri­tain’s sec­ond wave, which gov­ern­ment sci­en­tists warned could reach 50,000 new cases a day by the mid­dle of next month, but they meant more pain for the world’s fifth­largest econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Masks will be re­quired in more set­tings, there will be tougher en­force­ment of rules and the mil­i­tary could be brought in to help free up the po­lice, Mr John­son said.</p>
    <p>Schools and uni­ver­si­ties are to stay open, but a plan to re­open large sport­ing events and busi­ness con­fer­ences from Oct 1 will no longer take ef­fect.</p>
    <p>FINES</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses break­ing Covid-19 laws face penal­ties of up to £10,000 (S$17,400) or even clo­sure, while in­di­vid­u­als may be fined £200 for not wear­ing a mask in the right place.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son said it was frus­trat­ing for the law-abid­ing ma­jor­ity to see a few “brazenly de­fy­ing the rules”.</p>
    <p>Asked in Par­lia­ment why Bri­tain’s fig­ures were worse than Ger­many’s and Italy’s, Mr John­son said: “There is an im­por­tant dif­fer­ence be­tween our coun­try and</p>
    <p>FREE­DOM-LOV­ING COUN­TRY</p>
    <p>many other coun­tries around the world and that is our coun­try is a free­dom-lov­ing coun­try...</p>
    <p>“It is very dif­fi­cult to ask the Bri­tish pop­u­la­tion uni­formly to obey guide­lines in the way that is nec­es­sary.”</p>
    <p>Bri­tain al­ready has the big­gest of­fi­cial Covid-19 death toll in Europe – 41,788 – while it is bor­row­ing record amounts to pump emer­gency money through the dam­aged econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Bank of Eng­land gov­er­nor An­drew Bailey warned that the “very un­for­tu­nate” es­ca­la­tion of Covid-19 cases threat­ened the eco­nomic out­look and said the cen­tral bank was look­ing hard at how it could sup­port the econ­omy fur­ther.</p>
    <p>Pub op­er­a­tor JD Wether­spoon said it could cut 400 to 450 jobs at six air­ports, in­clud­ing Lon­don’s Heathrow and Gatwick, be­cause of the large drop in pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion leader Keir Starmer urged the gov­ern­ment not to end a fur­lough scheme at the end of next month, ac­cus­ing it of los­ing con­trol of the coro­n­avirus cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son said: “We will not lis­ten to those who say ‘let the virus rip’, nor to those who urge a per­ma­nent lock­down.</p>
    <p>“We are tak­ing de­ci­sive and ap­pro­pri­ate steps to bal­ance sav­ing lives and pro­tect­ing jobs and liveli­hoods.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Scot­land has said it will in­tro­duce ad­di­tional curbs on house­hold gath­er­ings that go fur­ther than Mr John­son’s new rules.</p>
    <p>First Min­is­ter Ni­cola Stur­geon said yes­ter­day: “We in­tend, as North­ern Ire­land did yes­ter­day, to also in­tro­duce na­tion­wide ad­di­tional re­stric­tions on house­hold gath­er­ings, sim­i­lar to those al­ready in place in the west of Scot­land.”</p>
    <p>There is an im­por­tant dif­fer­ence be­tween our coun­try and many other coun­tries around the world and that is our coun­try is a free­dom-lov­ing coun­try...</p>
    <p>It is very dif­fi­cult to ask the Bri­tish pop­u­la­tion uni­formly to obey guide­lines in the way that is nec­es­sary.</p>
