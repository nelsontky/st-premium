    <p>In 2011, Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s book Hard Truths To Keep Sin­ga­pore Go­ing was pub­lished. The book by our found­ing prime min­is­ter was a warn­ing to Sin­ga­pore­ans, es­pe­cially the young, who, brought up in an era of peace and prosperity, do not re­alise how dif­fi­cult it is to keep Sin­ga­pore go­ing, let alone thriv­ing, in nor­mal times.</p>
    <p>Yet, as the elec­tion re­sults show, the young have lit­tle ap­pre­ci­a­tion of the hard truths that the coun­try faces, not even in these ex­tra­or­di­nary times.</p>
    <p>I find it ironic that many peo­ple who lament the death of Mr Lee say that the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) is no longer the party it once was, yet it is the one party that con­tin­ues to up­hold the found­ing prime min­is­ter’s val­ues.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve that years of peace and prosperity have lulled the young into a state of com­pla­cency. They think what we have now is a nat­u­ral state of af­fairs. They want to im­port hip Amer­i­can ideas with­out due re­gard to our cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>When has Sin­ga­pore suc­ceeded by copy­ing the West? From our early days when we re­jected im­port sub­sti­tu­tion in favour of ex­port-led growth and al­lowed multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions to set up here rather than op­pose “cap­i­tal­ist ex­ploita­tion”, our Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund, race quota in Hous­ing Board es­tates, tri­par­tism, Pro­gres­sive Wage Model in place of min­i­mum wage leg­is­la­tion, an elected pres­i­dent with cus­to­dial pow­ers, and other ex­am­ples, we took in the lessons of other coun­tries, but we never copied them.</p>
    <p>Be­cause we can­not change our size (or lo­ca­tion), we have to be ex­cep­tional. With such a small mar­gin of er­ror, qual­ity is an ex­is­ten­tial ques­tion. And it starts with the right po­lit­i­cal lead­er­ship and po­lit­i­cal land­scape.</p>
    <p>What needs to be done? Al­ready, many voices are say­ing that the PAP must lis­ten to the young. Of course, the PAP has to lis­ten to all, es­pe­cially the young.</p>
    <p>I sug­gest that Sin­ga­pore in­tro­duce Hard Truths To Keep Sin­ga­pore Go­ing into the ju­nior col­lege, poly­tech­nic and univer­sity syl­labuses. We need to ed­u­cate the young on the unique sit­u­a­tion we are in. We do not need to teach Mr Lee’s so­lu­tions, but should ex­am­ine what he said and try to fig­ure out so­lu­tions that are rel­e­vant for ev­ery gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>I hope the young re­alise what is at stake. In the fol­low­ing months, when the world econ­omy tanks fur­ther, some of the hard truths will be­come clearer.</p>
