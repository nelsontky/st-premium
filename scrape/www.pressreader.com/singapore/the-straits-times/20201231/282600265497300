    <p>•</p>
    <p>Con­sec­u­tive Premier League wins for the first time since the open­ing two games of the sea­son means Arse­nal can en­ter the new year look­ing up the ta­ble with hope rather than over their shoul­ders.</p>
    <p>Alexan­dre La­cazette came on in the sec­ond half to change the game, tee­ing up Bukayo Saka’s pass with his first touch be­fore scor­ing with his sec­ond to se­cure a 1-0 win at Brighton and Hove Al­bion on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>De­feat at Ever­ton on Dec 19 had left them only four points above the drop zone after 14 top-flight games – their worst start to the sea­son since 1974-75 – but six points since have given Mikel Arteta’s side more breath­ing space.</p>
    <p>A vic­tory at strug­glers West Bromwich Al­bion on Satur­day can even sig­nal a push into the top 10 and the Arse­nal man­ager is hope­ful the mood in the dress­ing room has changed for bet­ter.</p>
    <p>“In this pe­riod, we know how much we needed the wins,” Arteta said. “We had a re­ally tough week and it wasn’t that much about the per­for­mance, it was about the re­sult. You need the results to start con­fi­dence and now with two wins, I think ev­ery­one is in a much bet­ter mood.</p>
    <p>“The best medicine is wins – it’s a dif­fer­ent world and a dif­fer­ent story. The pic­ture looks much bet­ter at the mo­ment. We need more con­sis­tency and to try to win again.</p>
    <p>“We have man­aged through this pe­riod to main­tain our team spirit and our co­he­sion. Some­times, that is not easy to do, be­cause ob­vi­ously the frus­tra­tion that comes out with de­feats usu­ally af­fects the team.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully, now we can go on a run of games and be more pos­i­tive for that.”</p>
    <p>Arteta also in­sisted that he never feared he had lost the back­ing of the board, de­spite the in­tense spec­u­la­tion over his po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>“Con­sid­er­ing the con­text we’re in now, the pan­demic and the prob­lems we’ve had re­cently, it’s been quite a chal­lenge,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I’m en­joy­ing and suf­fer­ing in some mo­ments, but I have great peo­ple around me and a great or­gan­i­sa­tion.”</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard also praised Saka and La­cazette, Arse­nal’s top scorer this sea­son with seven goals in all com­pe­ti­tions, for their vi­tal con­tri­bu­tions.</p>
    <p>Eng­land winger Saka, who made his in­ter­na­tional de­but in Oc­to­ber, has been a rare bright spark in Arse­nal’s tur­bu­lent cam­paign and Arteta is keen not to place the bur­den of expectatio­ns on the 19-yearold.</p>
    <p>“I would like ev­ery­body to be cau­tious and let him be and let him de­velop. I think he’s hav­ing the right pro­gres­sion,” he said of the academy grad­u­ate.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully, we can be the right coaches around him, be the right club to see the player that he can be in the fu­ture.”</p>
