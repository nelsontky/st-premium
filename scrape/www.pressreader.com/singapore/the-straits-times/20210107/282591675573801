    <p>1</p>
    <p>ELECTRO-POP</p>
    <p>DAYS TO MORN­ING GLORY</p>
    <p>Shye</p>
    <p>This is the de­but al­bum of 18-year-old singer, song­writer and pro­ducer Shye (right), who won the Vans Mu­si­cians Wanted com­pe­ti­tion in 2018 and the Best Song To Un­wind To prize at the Youth Mu­sic Awards 2019.</p>
    <p>“In my eyes, morn­ing glo­ries, though com­mon, are beau­ti­ful and drive home the mes­sage to em­brace our­selves with all our im­per­fec­tions,” she says of the flow­er­ing plant that in­spired the al­bum’s ti­tle.</p>
    <p>“The fact that they faithfully un­ravel in full bloom each morn­ing but fade away be­fore the day is over is a re­minder for us to turn up for our­selves no mat­ter the sit­u­a­tion we find our­selves in.</p>
    <p>“Each dawn is a new be­gin­ning and a chance to do bet­ter for our­selves and oth­ers. Choose to get bet­ter, not bit­ter.”</p>
    <p>Gen Neo is a Sin­ga­porean singer-song­writer, pro­ducer and com­poser based in South Korea, who has penned and pro­duced songs for K-pop acts such as Got7 and Su­per Ju­nior.</p>
    <p>Com­pris­ing six tracks sung in both Man­darin and English, his lat­est EP is a fol­low-up to his de­but Di­men­sions, which was re­leased in 2017.</p>
    <p>One of the tracks, What Can I Do, is a col­lab­o­ra­tion with Tai­wanese rap­per and pro­ducer J. Sheon.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>ELEC­TRONIC</p>
    <p>LATE TO THE LOUD­NESS WAR</p>
    <p>De­formed</p>
    <p>Elec­tronic mu­sic pro­ducer De­formed, whose real name is Ab­dul Hakiim, is a stu­dent at the Yong Siew Toh Con­ser­va­tory of Mu­sic and an ar­ranger, key­boardist and pi­anist in the Sin­ga­pore Malay Youth Orches­tra.</p>
    <p>His lat­est al­bum is de­scribed in a press state­ment as “Gen­er­a­tion Z’s re­sponse to late-stage cap­i­tal­ism and the death of a post-mod­ern world”.</p>
    <p>The harsh elec­tronic tracks are his op­ti­mistic take on the crazi­ness that de­fined last year.</p>
    <p>4 ELEC­TRONIC SO­LACE IN MY SLEEP</p>
    <p>shy-c</p>
    <p>Mu­si­cian, singer and pro­ducer shy-c is known for his work with other Sin­ga­pore artistes such as lewloh, Ben­nett Bay and Estelle Fly.</p>
    <p>The four elec­tronic tracks in his EP are in­spired by gen­res such as rock, lo-fi and synth-pop.</p>
    <p>He says: “These are songs for the weary hearts seek­ing respite from the daily stres­sors and life’s pres­sures, the ones who are look­ing for a sense of warmth that ac­com­pa­nies the break of dawn.”</p>
    <p>5 ELEC­TRONIC</p>
    <p>SEED Syn­di­cate</p>
    <p>This 23-track com­pi­la­tion by au­dio-vis­ual col­lec­tive Syn­di­cate fea­tures works from var­i­ous mu­si­cians, song­writ­ers and pro­duc­ers in the elec­tronic, ex­per­i­men­tal and al­ter­na­tive mu­sic scene.</p>
    <p>All the songs were com­posed dur­ing the pan­demic. “We wanted Seed to be a time cap­sule more than any­thing else,” the col­lec­tive writes on its Band­camp page. “Un­cer­tainty still rules the day, but at least for now, we know what un­cer­tainty sounds like from the con­tribut­ing artistes. This is enough to keep us go­ing.”</p>
    <p>The artistes in­clude turntab­list KoFlow; ex­per­i­men­tal mu­si­cian, poet and Young Artist Award re­cip­i­ent Bani Haykal; and Syn­di­cate founders, elec­tronic mu­sic stal­warts Kiat and Cherry Chan.</p>
    <p>6 ELEC­TRONIC ISEKAI</p>
    <p>Claude Glass</p>
    <p>Claude Glass is the al­ter ego of singer, mu­si­cian and elec­tronic mu­sic artist Isa Ong (above), best known for his work with in­die and al­ter­na­tive rock bands such as Pleas­antry, Am­a­teur Takes Con­trol and sub:shaman.</p>
    <p>The ti­tle of his de­but EP means “dif­fer­ent world” in Ja­panese and refers to an anime genre that fo­cuses on pro­tag­o­nists who are trans­ported from one re­al­ity to an­other. Ong says he draws in­spi­ra­tion from mu­sic, games and films, which al­low him to es­cape re­al­ity into a “dif­fer­ent world”.</p>
    <p>7</p>
    <p>ELEC­TRONIC/ROCK</p>
    <p>SONGS OF LOVE LOST & ISO­LA­TION</p>
    <p>Lu­narin</p>
    <p>Pro­gres­sive rock stal­warts Lu­narin, formed in 2003, had planned to call it quits in 2019.</p>
    <p>But the Covid-19 pan­demic re­sulted in a new wave of in­spi­ra­tion and they ended up mak­ing an EP with a more pop- and elec­tronic-ori­ented sound.</p>
    <p>Iso­lated in their own homes, the trio pieced to­gether the songs over e-mail, What­sApp mes­sages and Zoom meet­ings.</p>
    <p>The four songs – Bod­ies, Hold My Soul, In­vis­i­ble and Burn – are de­scribed as the band’s “quiet re­sponse to the dis­con­cert­ing events un­fold­ing in the world”.</p>
    <p>8</p>
    <p>PRO­GRES­SIVE ROCK/FU­SION PAR­AL­LEL VOR­TEX</p>
    <p>Joanna Lim</p>
    <p>Par­al­lel Vor­tex is the de­but solo al­bum of Sin­ga­porean key­boardist and sax­o­phon­ist Joanna Lim, who plays in home-grown bands such as pro­gres­sive-rock out­fit Zero Se­quence.</p>
    <p>The ti­tle re­flects how the pan­demic has changed the lives of many – “par­al­lel” al­ludes to how one por­trays one­self in dif­fer­ent ways, while “vor­tex” refers to the un­rest that pushes peo­ple to­wards a down­ward spi­ral.</p>
    <p>The in­tri­cate and com­plex in­stru­men­tals also fea­ture mu­si­cians such as Lim’s hus­band, gui­tarist Si­mon Yong.</p>
    <p>The al­bum is ded­i­cated to her late fa­ther, Mike Lim, who died of can­cer in 2008.</p>
    <p>9 R&B/HIP-HOP ONE 65</p>
    <p>Yung Raja, Fariz Jabba and Zadon</p>
    <p>In this EP, three hip-hop artists – Yung Raja, Fariz Jabba and Zadon – re­make lo­cal clas­sics in their mother tongues and give them a con­tem­po­rary twist.</p>
    <p>Rap­per Yung Raja, aided by pro­ducer Ri­i­dem, takes on Na­tional Day clas­sic Mun­naeru Vaal­ibaa.</p>
    <p>Singer-rap­per Fariz Jabba and pro­ducer Alyph trans­form Pan­dang Kasih – one of the sig­na­ture songs by 1950s and 1960s Malay singer Saloma – into a con­tem­po­rary R&B tune re-ti­tled Dari Sini.</p>
    <p>Moon­light is singer Zadon and pro­ducer Lineath’s re-imag­ined ver­sion of Mavis Hee’s Man­dopop clas­sic Moon­light In The City.</p>
