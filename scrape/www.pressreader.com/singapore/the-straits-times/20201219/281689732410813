    <p>• A host of Euro­pean lead­ers are self-iso­lat­ing af­ter com­ing into con­tact with French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron, who tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Both Span­ish Prime Min­is­ter Pe­dro Sanchez and his Por­tuguese coun­ter­part Antonio Costa have tested neg­a­tive for the coro­n­avirus but will stay in self-iso­la­tion, their of­fices said.</p>
    <p>Mr Sanchez will re­main iso­lated and un­der med­i­cal sur­veil­lance un­til Dec 24 and will be tested again at that point, a state­ment from his of­fice said.</p>
    <p>He was the only mem­ber of a Span­ish del­e­ga­tion to come into close con­tact with Mr Macron dur­ing a visit to Paris for an Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment (OECD) event on Monday, it added.</p>
    <p>Mr Costa and Mr Macron had a work­ing lunch at the El­y­see Palace on Wed­nes­day to dis­cuss pri­or­i­ties of Por­tu­gal’s up­com­ing Euro­pean Coun­cil pres­i­dency, which starts next month. Mr Costa’s of­fice said he would work re­motely and wait for the health authority to de­cide how long he will have to stay home.</p>
    <p>“I feel good and with­out any symp­toms,” Mr Costa, 59, wrote on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean Coun­cil Pres­i­dent Charles Michel, who had lunch with Mr Macron on Monday, also went into self­quar­an­tine on Thurs­day, Mr Michel’s spokesman Barend Leyts tweeted.</p>
    <p>Mr Michel’s self-quar­an­tine is a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure as he is not con­sid­ered to have come into close con­tact with Mr Macron, and he tested neg­a­tive on Tuesday dur­ing a rou­tine test, Mr Leyts added.</p>
    <p>OECD Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral An­gel Gur­ria said on Thurs­day that he was also quar­an­tin­ing. “My thoughts are with Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron for a speedy re­cov­ery,” Mr Gur­ria said on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal party chiefs from France’s Lower House of Par­lia­ment, the Na­tional As­sem­bly, were also in iso­la­tion as they had a lunch with Mr Macron ear­lier this week.</p>
