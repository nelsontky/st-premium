    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion is con­sid­er­ing a sweep­ing ban on travel to the United States by mem­bers of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP) and their fam­i­lies, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the pro­posal – a move that would al­most cer­tainly prompt re­tal­i­a­tion against Amer­i­cans seek­ing to en­ter or re­main in China and ex­ac­er­bate ten­sions be­tween the two na­tions.</p>
    <p>The pres­i­den­tial procla­ma­tion, still in draft form, could also au­tho­rise the US gov­ern­ment to re­voke the visas of party mem­bers and their fam­i­lies who are al­ready in the coun­try, lead­ing to their ex­pul­sion. Some pro­posed lan­guage is also aimed at lim­it­ing travel to the US by mem­bers of the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army and ex­ec­u­tives at state-owned en­ter­prises, al­though many of them are also likely to be party mem­bers.</p>
    <p>De­tails of the plan, de­scribed by four peo­ple with knowl­edge of the dis­cus­sions, have not yet been fi­nalised, and Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump might ul­ti­mately re­ject it.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese for­eign min­istry spokesman Hua Chun­y­ing told re­porters dur­ing a daily brief­ing yes­ter­day that such a ban, if true, would be “pa­thetic”.</p>
    <p>While the Pres­i­dent and his cam­paign strate­gists have been in­tent on por­tray­ing him as tough on China for re-elec­tion pur­poses, Mr Trump has vac­il­lated wildly in both his lan­guage and ac­tions on the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment since tak­ing of­fice in 2017. He has crit­i­cised China on some is­sues, par­tic­u­larly trade. But he has also lav­ished praise on Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, pleaded with Mr Xi to help him win re-elec­tion and re­mained silent or even ex­plic­itly ap­proved of the re­pres­sion in Hong Kong and Xin­jiang.</p>
    <p>There are prac­ti­cal is­sues as well. The CCP has 92 mil­lion mem­bers. Al­most three mil­lion Chi­nese cit­i­zens vis­ited the US in 2018, al­though the num­bers have plum­meted be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and the cur­rent ban on most trav­ellers from China. The US gov­ern­ment has no knowl­edge of party sta­tus for a vast majority of them. So try­ing to im­me­di­ately iden­tify party mem­bers to ei­ther pre­vent their en­try or ex­pel those al­ready in the US would be dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>The pres­i­den­tial or­der would cite the same statute in the Im­mi­gra­tion and Na­tion­al­ity Act used in a 2017 travel ban on a num­ber of pre</p>
    <p>PROVOCA­TIVE AC­TION</p>
    <p>Such a move would in­flame pub­lic opin­ion in China, as this would tar­get nearly 10 per cent of the en­tire Chi­nese pop­u­la­tion and would do so based on ’’ blan­ket as­ser­tions of guilt. MR JUDE BLANCHETTE, a China scholar at the Cen­tre for Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies in Wash­ing­ton, re­fer­ring to the po­ten­tial travel ban.</p>
    <p>dom­i­nantly Mus­lim coun­tries that gives the pres­i­dent power to tem­po­rar­ily block travel to the US by for­eign na­tion­als who are deemed “detri­men­tal to the in­ter­ests of the United States”.</p>
    <p>The 2017 ban was fought in the courts and ex­panded this year.</p>
    <p>Such a broad ban would be the most provoca­tive ac­tion against China by the US since the start of the trade war be­tween the two coun­tries in 2018. It would fur­ther poi­son US-China re­la­tions, wors­en­ing sev­eral years of open clashes over the econ­omy, tech­nol­ogy and global in­flu­ence that have led some diplo­mats and an­a­lysts to draw com­par­isons to a new Cold War.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials are also de­bat­ing a va­ri­ety of for­mu­la­tions for ban­ning Chi­nese travel to the US short of bar­ring all party mem­bers, such as tar­get­ing only the 25 mem­bers of the rul­ing Polit­buro and their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>In re­cent months, top ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials have tried to draw a dis­tinc­tion be­tween party mem­bers and other Chi­nese, say­ing the party must be pun­ished for its ac­tions – and its global am­bi­tions must be thwarted. They have loudly de­nounced what they call the evils of the CCP, point­ing to the role of its of­fi­cials in the cover-up of the ini­tial coro­n­avirus out­break, the de­ten­tions of one mil­lion or more Mus­lims in in­tern­ment camps and the dis­man­tling of civil lib­er­ties in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Count­ing party mem­bers as well as their fam­i­lies, the ban could tech­ni­cally bar travel to the US for as many as 270 mil­lion peo­ple, ac­cord­ing to one in­ter­nal ad­min­is­tra­tion es­ti­mate.</p>
    <p>“The over­whelm­ing majority of CCP mem­bers have no in­volve­ment or in­put into Bei­jing’s pol­i­cy­mak­ing, so go­ing af­ter the en­tire party mem­ber­ship is like China sanc­tion­ing all Repub­li­cans be­cause of frus­tra­tions with Trump,” said Mr Jude Blanchette, a China scholar at the Cen­tre for Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies in Wash­ing­ton.</p>
