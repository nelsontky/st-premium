    <p>More wor­ship­pers will be able to at­tend Fri­day prayers at mosques from Nov 13, un­der a pi­lot at 10 mosques to in­crease the max­i­mum num­ber of peo­ple al­lowed at each ses­sion from 100 now to 150.</p>
    <p>Ten mosques will al­low 150 wor­ship­pers at each Fri­day prayer ses­sion in a pi­lot pro­gramme start­ing on Nov 13.</p>
    <p>The mosques are lo­cated across the is­land – Al-Is­lah, Al-Istigh­far and Darul Ghufran in the east, AnNur, Assyafaah and Yu­sof Ishak in the north, An­gul­lia and Sul­tan in the south, and Al-Khair and Maarof in the west.</p>
    <p>The new limit, up from 100 pre­vi­ously, will al­low each mosque to serve 450 wor­ship­pers across three ses­sions ev­ery Fri­day – at 12.45pm, 1.45pm and 2.45pm, said the Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore (Muis) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The aim is to lift the limit to 250 peo­ple at each ses­sion by the end of the year, it added.</p>
    <p>The 150 wor­ship­pers at each ses­sion will be split into three zones of up to 50 peo­ple, which com­plies with ex­ist­ing Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Min­istry guide­lines.</p>
    <p>On Sept 26, Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Min­is­ter Ed­win Tong said that a pi­lot of wor­ship ses­sions of up to 250 par­tic­i­pants will be con­ducted from Oct 3 for re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions that have safely con­ducted ser­vices for 100 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Since Oct 3, all re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions have also been al­lowed to con­duct ser­vices of up to 100 peo­ple, with con­gre­gants split into zones of up to 50 each.</p>
    <p>Mr Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli, So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment Min­is­ter and</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter-in-charge of Mus­lim Af­fairs, said the de­ci­sion to start the pi­lot was in­flu­enced by the low com­mu­nity coron­avirus case count.</p>
    <p>Con­gre­gants en­ter­ing the 10 mosques un­der the pi­lot must check in us­ing the TraceTo­gether app or to­ken. TraceTo­gether check-ins have been made avail­able at 40 of Sin­ga­pore’s 71 mosques since Oct 23.</p>
    <p>“This will be the prac­tice that we want to get our com­mu­nity used to, be­cause when ev­ery­one has got a to­ken in the na­tion, this will be­come com­pul­sory when we en­ter cer­tain places,” said Mr Masa­gos, who was speak­ing on the side­lines of an event to com­mem­o­rate the</p>
    <p>birth month of Prophet Muham­mad yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Muis added that us­ing TraceTo­gether means quicker con­tact trac­ing, while also al­low­ing for the lo­cal­i­sa­tion of pos­si­ble in­fec­tions so mosques will have to clean and dis­in­fect only ar­eas fre­quented by pos­i­tive cases.</p>
    <p>“This al­lows for faster and safer re­open­ing of mosque premises, and re­duces the time to re­open,” it said.</p>
    <p>Mr Masa­gos noted that while Covid-19 re­stric­tions are be­ing eased at places of wor­ship, the pan­demic is not over: “We need to put all th­ese safe mea­sures (in place) to en­sure that the in­fec­tions do not go out of hand, as we have seen in many places.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause when we let down our guard... that is when one in­fec­tion may be a su­per-spreader in­ci­dent that can cause an ex­plo­sion of in­fec­tions in the com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>Reg­is­tra­tion for Fri­day prayers on Nov 13 and 20 at all mosques can be done from 10am on Nov 10 at our­mosques.com­mon­spaces.sg</p>
