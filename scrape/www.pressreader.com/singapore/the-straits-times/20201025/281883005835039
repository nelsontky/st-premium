    <p>Thai King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn’s praise for a man who held up a royal por­trait at a protest site in Bangkok has drawn con­tro­versy in Thai­land, win­ning ac­claim from monar­chists and scorn from protesters.</p>
    <p>The King has not made any pub­lic com­ment on more than three months of protests, which have in­creas­ingly tar­geted the monar­chy as well as the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>But in video footage recorded on Fri­day evening as the King greeted well-wish­ers out­side the Grand Palace, he is heard prais­ing a monar­chist who is in­tro­duced by Queen Suthida as the man who held up the royal por­trait while oth­ers were protest­ing a few days ear­lier.</p>
    <p>“Very brave, very brave, very good, thank you,” the King said.</p>
    <p>The Royal Palace made no com­ment, as it has not since the antigov­ern­ment protests started in July.</p>
    <p>The video was posted on the roy­al­ist’s Face­book page along with sev­eral other videos of the event and pic­tures from last Tues­day show­ing him hold­ing the por­trait.</p>
    <p>“Their majesties recog­nised me. This is the high­est point of my life,” wrote the man, Mr Thi­ti­wat Tana­ga­roon.</p>
    <p>The au­then­tic­ity of the video could not be in­de­pen­dently ver­i­fied. Sev­eral other peo­ple at the event recorded the en­counter and posted videos on­line, but the King’s words were not clear amid the chant­ing.</p>
    <p>The King’s com­ments drew a big re­sponse.</p>
    <p>“Just see­ing this pic­ture, we are very touched,” roy­al­ist leader Warong Dechgitvi­grom posted. “This is the Thai way and Thai so­ci­ety of car­ing, sup­port­ing and pro­tect­ing. To­day it’s con­sid­ered that his in­sti­tu­tion has adapted to be very close to the peo­ple. That made the great­est im­pres­sion.”</p>
    <p>But also among the top trend­ing hash­tags on Twit­ter in Thai­land, tweeted well over 500,000 times, was #23Oc­tEyesOpene­d – used by protesters and their sup­port­ers who say the palace has now made its po­si­tion clear. The hash­tag #VeryBraveV­eryGoodTha­nkYou was also widely used – along­side sar­cas­tic com­ments.</p>
    <p>“Very brave, very brave, very good for such a clear ex­pres­sion,” read a com­ment from protest leader Tat­tep Ruang­pra­paik­it­seree. He has put less em­pha­sis than oth­ers on calls for royal re­form.</p>
    <p>An­other protest leader, Mr Pi­yarat Chongthep, com­mented: “The King has not been above po­lit­i­cal prob­lems but al­ways sits at the heart of the prob­lems.”</p>
    <p>Mr James Buchanan, a lec­turer at Bangkok’s Mahi­dol Univer­sity In­ter­na­tional Col­lege, said the King’s com­ments marked his clear­est in­ter­ven­tion so far in Thai­land’s cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“I in­ter­pret it as sig­nalling that the King ac­knowl­edges the chal­lenge to his author­ity by the protests, but will not back down,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Thai protesters have three core de­mands: The amend­ment of the Con­sti­tu­tion, the res­ig­na­tion of Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha and other coup-re­lated en­ti­ties like ap­pointed sen­a­tors, and monar­chy re­form.</p>
    <p>The protesters ac­cuse Mr Prayut, a for­mer junta leader, of en­gi­neer­ing an elec­tion last year to hold on to power. The Prime Min­is­ter de­nies the ac­cu­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The coun­try is set to face a fresh wave of protests af­ter Mr Prayut let lapse the demon­stra­tors’ dead­line for him to quit by yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Two of the main protest groups – Free Youth and the United Front of Tham­masat and Demon­stra­tion – have vowed to stage mass gath­er­ings un­til all of their de­mands are met.</p>
    <p>“If tonight passes and the gov­ern­ment still ig­nores the de­mands of the peo­ple, we’ll step up the pres­sure so that th­ese de­mands could come true,” the Tham­masat group posted on Face­book yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The with­drawal of a state of emer­gency in Bangkok on Fri­day and the con­ven­ing of a spe­cial ses­sion of Par­lia­ment this week have failed to pla­cate protesters.</p>
    <p>The Prime Min­is­ter has be­come vul­ner­a­ble af­ter fail­ing to stem the protests, which may even­tu­ally pave the way for his ouster, said as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor Christo­pher Ankersen from New York Univer­sity’s School of Pro­fes­sional Stud­ies Cen­tre for Global Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>“It’s fea­si­ble that he could be re­moved from of­fice ei­ther through a po­lit­i­cal machi­na­tion of some kind within his own party... or some other route, such as a for­mal royal in­ter­ven­tion,” Prof Ankersen said.</p>
    <p>“Such a move could be used as a sop to the protesters, a way of fore­stalling real change, while ad­dress­ing at least one of the main protest de­mands.”</p>
    <p>SHOW OF SUP­PORT</p>
    <p>Very brave, very brave, very good, thank you.</p>
    <p>KING MAHA VA­JI­RA­LONGKORN, in re­marks prais­ing a monar­chist on Fri­day af­ter Queen Suthida in­tro­duced him as the man who held up a royal por­trait dur­ing an ear­lier protest in Bangkok.</p>
