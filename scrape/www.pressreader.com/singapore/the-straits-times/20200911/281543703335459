    <p>Prov­inces bor­der­ing In­done­sia’s cap­i­tal are set to fol­low the city’s lead in reim­pos­ing strict re­stric­tions next week to deal with surg­ing coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions. Jakarta’s sur­prise an­nounce­ment of a par­tial lock­down re­ceived sup­port from the West Java gov­er­nor yes­ter­day, but was crit­i­cised by the fed­eral gov­ern­ment, which was not no­ti­fied ahead of time.</p>
    <p>Re­gions that share a bor­der with Jakarta are set to fol­low the cap­i­tal city in reim­pos­ing strict re­stric­tions, lo­cally termed as PSBB, next week to deal with surg­ing coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>In a co­or­di­na­tion meet­ing a day af­ter Jakarta’s sur­prise an­nounce­ment to “pull an emer­gency brake”, an equiv­a­lent to Singapore’s cir­cuit breaker mea­sures, Gov­er­nor Anies Baswedan yes­ter­day re­ceived sup­port from Mr Rid­wan Kamil, Gov­er­nor of West Java prov­ince, the cap­i­tal’s largest neigh­bour.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ters in the same vir­tual meet­ing, how­ever, crit­i­cised Mr Anies for not giv­ing the na­tional gov­ern­ment a heads-up on this move.</p>
    <p>“We will fol­low the Jakarta gov­ern­ment’s lead. If Jakarta reim­poses PSBB, we should do the same,” said a se­nior of­fi­cial who was at the co­or­di­na­tion meet­ing, echo­ing Mr Rid­wan’s stand.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, Mr Anies said hos­pi­tals would reach full ca­pac­ity by the sec­ond week of next month if large-scale so­cial re­stric­tions, which had been grad­u­ally eased since June, were not re­in­stated.</p>
    <p>The Jakarta gov­ern­ment has been un­der fire for a lack of en­force­ment against restau­rants and busi­nesses that breach health pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>Many restau­rants did not com­ply with a rule to cap guests at 50 per cent seat ca­pac­ity, but were not pe­nalised for this.</p>
    <p>Java – In­done­sia’s most pop­u­lous is­land, where Jakarta is lo­cated – ac­counts for 57 per cent of all in­fec­tions in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Other prov­inces with the most Covid-19 cases are South Su­lawesi and South Kal­i­man­tan.</p>
    <p>Health and trans­porta­tion ex­perts have said that reim­pos­ing PSBB in Jakarta would be point­less if sur­round­ing re­gions do not do the same, as hu­man traf­fic in and out of Greater Jakarta re­mains high.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that hos­pi­tals have been re­ceiv­ing a no­tice­ably higher num­ber of coro­n­avirus pa­tients who are teenagers or above 60 in the past week.</p>
    <p>Some ob­servers at­trib­uted this to fam­ily clus­ters trig­gered by a long week­end hol­i­day for In­done­sia’s In­de­pen­dence Day in mid-Au­gust that saw many Jakar­tans leave the city for a few days’ break and re­turn in­fected with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Dr Fir­man Noor, head of In­done­sian In­sti­tute of Sciences’ po­lit­i­cal re­search cen­tre, said that ar­eas with high cases, such as Surabaya in East Java, should reim­pose curbs.</p>
    <p>“It’s point­less to be­lieve things would get bet­ter. The econ­omy is not im­prov­ing, and more peo­ple are get­ting sick and dy­ing,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The Jakarta ad­min­is­tra­tion said ear­lier this week that the oc­cu­pancy rate of iso­la­tion rooms in the city’s 67 Covid-19 re­fer­ral hos­pi­tals has hit 77 per cent, and the rate for in­ten­sive care units has hit 83 per cent.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia first an­nounced its first coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions in early March and the ear­li­est cases were all in Jakarta.</p>
    <p>The hos­pi­tals will reach full ca­pac­ity by next Thurs­day, but the au­thor­i­ties are plan­ning to in­crease ca­pac­ity by about 20 per cent as they en­gage more pri­vate hos­pi­tals to treat Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>This will in­crease iso­la­tion beds from 4,053 to 4,807.</p>
    <p>But with­out strict ef­forts to curb the spread of the virus, Jakarta will ex­haust this new ca­pac­ity by the sec­ond week of next month.</p>
    <p>“It is like we have been run­ning a marathon since March – we are ex­hausted. This is not to be un­der­es­ti­mated. The sit­u­a­tion is not un­der con­trol,” Dr Erlina Burhan, a pul­mo­nolo­gist f rom Per­sa­ha­batan Hos­pi­tal, was re­ported by Reuters as say­ing.</p>
    <p>Co­or­di­nat­ing Eco­nomic Min­is­ter Air­langga Har­tarto said yes­ter­day that a bal­ance must be struck be­tween press­ing the gas pedal and the brake in de­cid­ing poli­cies to fight Covid-19.</p>
    <p>He stressed that hit­ting the brakes has taken a toll on eco­nomic sen­ti­ment, as re­flected by the plunge in the coun­try’s stock mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The Jakarta Com­pos­ite In­dex fell 5 per cent yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>MEA­SURES NEEDED IN OTHER AR­EAS</p>
    <p>Other ar­eas in Java must do what is be­ing done in Jakarta, es­pe­cially those with an im­mense bur­den on health­care (sys­tems) and a high num­ber of deaths.</p>
    <p>MR DICKY BUDI­MAN, an In­done­sian epi­demi­ol­o­gist at Aus­tralia’s Grif­fith Univer­sity, call­ing on other ad­min­is­tra­tions across Java to also im­pose strict curbs in or­der to have ef­fec­tive re­sults.</p>
    <p>DOC­TORS EX­HAUSTED</p>
    <p>It is like we have been run­ning a marathon since March – we are ex­hausted. This is not to be un­der­es­ti­mated.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion is not un­der con­trol.</p>
