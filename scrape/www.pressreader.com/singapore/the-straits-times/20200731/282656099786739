    <p>TOKYO • Craft beer, live mu­sic and lodg­ing fea­tured i n ren­o­va­tion plans that Mr Takuya Shimbo had for an age­ing Tokyo bath­house, as he hoped to res­cue a fad­ing in­dus­try from ex­tinc­tion by rein­vent­ing the con­cept of com­mu­nal bathing.</p>
    <p>Then the coro­n­avirus struck.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese govern­ment deemed the coun­try’s few re­main­ing bath­houses to be crit­i­cal for pub­lic hy­giene, so it re­quested they stay open. At the same time, it en­cour­aged peo­ple to stay home dur­ing a state of emer­gency to pre­vent the spread of Covid-19, which has killed around 1,000 Ja­panese peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“The costs, like staff and heat­ing, don’t change, but we had far fewer cus­tomers,” said Mr Shimbo, the 41-year-old third-gen­er­a­tion owner of Daikoku-yu i n north-east­ern Tokyo.</p>
    <p>The 60 per cent plunge i n cus­tomers, along with ex­penses for gut­ting and ren­o­vat­ing an­other de­crepit bath­house in the neigh­bour­hood, put him in pre­car­i­ous shape. “We were op­er­at­ing in the red,” he added.</p>
    <p>Bathing in nat­u­rally heated hot springs is a pop­u­lar leisure ac­tiv­ity in Ja­pan. On the other hand, pub­lic baths – or sento – tra­di­tion­ally served peo­ple who did not have a bath at home.</p>
    <p>Di­vided into sep­a­rate men’s and women’s sec­tions, bathers scrub down be­fore soak­ing to­gether in hot tubs.</p>
    <p>They have also been places to so­cialise and pro­mote com­mu­nity ties – and still are, though bathers are cur­rently dis­cour­aged from talk­ing to pre­vent the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“The best part of bath­house cul­ture is that sta­tus doesn’t mat­ter; whether you’re a child or an adult doesn’t mat­ter. Ev­ery­body goes in naked,” Mr Shimbo said. “But we have to change to sur­vive.”</p>
    <p>The num­ber of baths through­out Ja­pan peaked at 18,000 in 1968 but now stands at 2,000, hit by so­cial changes such as more baths at home.</p>
    <p>Even the ad­di­tion of sau­nas, jacuzzis and out­door baths with land­scap­ing has not been enough to com­pete with places like health spas.</p>
    <p>“Baths are good for com­mu­ni­ca­tion. You can be­come friendly with any­one,” said Mr Kiyoshi Hi­raoka, 83, who cy­cles 15 min­utes to pa­tro­n­ise Mr Shimbo’s Daikoku-yu and kept com­ing faith­fully even dur­ing the state of emer­gency.</p>
    <p>Mr Shimbo is among a new gen­er­a­tion of own­ers try­ing to keep the tra­di­tion alive with mod­ern at­trac­tions such as in-bath film screen­ings and lob­bies equipped with co-work­ing spa­ces and beer taps.</p>
    <p>His ef­forts in­clude com­edy shows, live mu­sic, yoga classes and – for one day – con­vert­ing the bath­house into a haunted house with roam­ing ghosts and corpses in the baths.</p>
    <p>Else­where i n Tokyo, sec­ond­gen­er­a­tion owner Hisao Iwasaki at­tributes the longevity of his bath­house partly to a lobby fea­tur­ing a model rail­way and a dozen cats.</p>
    <p>“If you don’t have some­thing spe­cial, cus­tomers won’t come,” he said.</p>
    <p>Even so, his wife Eiko said cus­tomers fell by half dur­ing the state of emer­gency.</p>
    <p>Mr Shimbo fears fewer than half of his area’s 18 bath­houses will still be open in five years’ time and hopes that by ren­o­vat­ing a dif­fer­ent bath­house in his neigh­bour­hood, he can help point own­ers in a new di­rec­tion for sur­vival.</p>
    <p>“A bath­house that also has a place to stay, a place to eat, a beer tap – if we make this a suc­cess­ful busi­ness model, oth­ers may do it, keep­ing bath­houses go­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>With build­ing plans post­poned by the pan­demic, and the num­ber of cus­tomers down while costs re­main un­changed, Mr Shimbo took to crowd­fund­ing to keep his plans afloat and raised seven mil­lion yen (S$91,720) – more than twice his goal.</p>
    <p>“I’m not sure we’ll be able to make up ev­ery­thing through this,” he said.</p>
    <p>But he added that many con­trib­u­tors had told him to keep on fight­ing. “The sup­port re­ally gave me courage... It showed me peo­ple want this sento cul­ture to go on,” he said.</p>
