    <p>A Sin­ga­porean man pleaded guilty on Fri­day to act­ing un­der the di­rec­tion of Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cials to ob­tain sen­si­tive in­for­ma­tion from Amer­i­cans, the US Jus­tice De­part­ment said.</p>
    <p>Yeo Jun Wei, also called Dick­son Yeo, pleaded guilty in fed­eral court in Wash­ing­ton, DC, to one count of act­ing within the United States as an il­le­gal for­eign agent.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments said he used a fake po­lit­i­cal con­sul­tancy in the US as a front to col­lect in­for­ma­tion for Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence, tar­get­ing Amer­i­can mil­i­tary and gov­ern­ment em­ploy­ees with se­cu­rity clear­ances on pro­fes­sional net­work­ing so­cial me­dia sites.</p>
    <p>Yeo would pay them to write re­ports which he said were meant for clients in Asia, but which were, in re­al­ity, sent with­out their knowl­edge to the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>He faces a max­i­mum penalty of 10 years in jail, and will be sen­tenced on Oct 9.</p>
    <p>Yeo en­rolled in 2015 as a PhD stu­dent at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Pol­icy in Sin­ga­pore, where he re­searched China’s frame­work of treat­ment for small states along its Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive tra­jec­tory, ac­cord­ing to the school’s web­site.</p>
    <p>He was re­cruited in 2015 by China in­tel­li­gence op­er­a­tives dur­ing a visit to Bei­jing, where he gave a pre­sen­ta­tion on the po­lit­i­cal sit­u­a­tion in South-east Asia, court doc­u­ments showed. In a “state­ment of facts” sub­mit­ted to the court and signed by Yeo, he ad­mit­ted to be­ing fully aware that he was work­ing for Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence, meet­ing agents dozens of times and be­ing given spe­cial treat­ment when he trav­elled to China.</p>
    <p>“Although these op­er­a­tives used pseu­do­nyms in their in­ter­ac­tions with Yeo, they were open about their af­fil­i­a­tion with the PRC (Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China) gov­ern­ment. One of the op­er­a­tives told Yeo that he and his boss worked for the PRC’s main in­tel­li­gence unit,” the state­ment read.</p>
    <p>His Chi­nese han­dlers asked him to get non-pub­lic in­for­ma­tion about the US Com­merce De­part­ment, ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, and the US-China trade war, even in­struct­ing him to cre­ate a fake con­sult­ing com­pany in 2018.</p>
    <p>Yeo did as he was told, us­ing the same name as a prom­i­nent US con­sult­ing firm that han­dles pub­lic and gov­ern­ment re­la­tions. His LinkedIn pro­file page lists the com­pany as Res­o­lute Con­sult­ing.</p>
    <p>He re­ceived more than 400 re­sumes, 90 per cent of which were from US mil­i­tary and gov­ern­ment per­son­nel with se­cu­rity clear­ances, and passed on re­sumes of in­ter­est to a Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence op­er­a­tive.</p>
    <p>Yeo even­tu­ally moved to Wash­ing­ton, DC, from Jan­uary to July last year, where he at­tended mul­ti­ple events at think-tanks to net­work and re­cruit more peo­ple to write re­ports.</p>
    <p>He was ar­rested when he re­turned to the US last Novem­ber to try to get a US Army of­fi­cer work­ing at the Pen­tagon to pro­vide more con­fi­den­tial in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Yeo’s case comes amid wors­en­ing US-China re­la­tions, with ac­cu­sa­tions that Bei­jing runs es­pi­onage and trade-se­cret theft op­er­a­tions in the US high on the list of Wash­ing­ton’s griev­ances.</p>
    <p>“The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment uses an ar­ray of du­plic­ity to ob­tain sen­si­tive in­for­ma­tion from un­sus­pect­ing Amer­i­cans,” said As­sis­tant At­tor­ney-Gen­eral for Na­tional Se­cu­rity John De­mers.</p>
    <p>He added: “Yeo was cen­tral to one such scheme, us­ing ca­reer net­work­ing sites and a false con­sult­ing firm to lure Amer­i­cans who might be of in­ter­est to the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment. This is yet another ex­am­ple of the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment’s ex­ploita­tion of the open­ness of Amer­i­can so­ci­ety.”</p>
