    <p>From April next year, Ja­pan will tighten its in­spec­tion process in is­su­ing visas, es­pe­cially to Chi­nese stu­dents and re­searchers, due to grow­ing con­cerns of es­pi­onage and for­eign in­ter­fer­ence, the pro-gov­ern­ment Yomi­uri news­pa­per re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Both the United States and Aus­tralia have al­leged a sys­tem­atic and strate­gic cam­paign waged by China to steal tech­nol­ogy and in­tel­li­gence through the de­ploy­ment of grad­u­ate stu­dents and re­searchers. They, along­side Ja­pan and In­dia, are part of the Quad bloc of coun­tries that are lead­ing the Free and Open Indo-Pa­cific vi­sion that was mooted as a coun­ter­weight to Chi­nese as­sertive­ness.</p>
    <p>From April next year, Ja­pan will tighten its in­spec­tion process in is­su­ing visas, es­pe­cially to Chi­nese stu­dents and re­searchers, over grow­ing con­cerns of es­pi­onage and for­eign in­ter­fer­ence, the pro-gov­ern­ment Yomi­uri news­pa­per said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In a front-page report, it said – with­out nam­ing any sources – that Tokyo sees the move as nec­es­sary amid fears that its sen­si­tive tech­nol­ogy and se­cu­rity in­tel­li­gence are be­ing leaked to China – or other coun­tries – by op­er­a­tives who have been granted en­try to Ja­pan as grad­u­ate stu­dents or aca­demic re­searchers.</p>
    <p>If the stricter visa move is im­ple­mented, Ja­pan will be act­ing in lock­step with its se­cu­rity ally, the United States, as well as with Aus­tralia in rais­ing the guard against al­leged Chi­nese in­ter­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The Yomi­uri report quoted an eco­nomic se­cu­rity pol­icy ex­pert as say­ing: “Chi­nese stu­dents who have been re­jected by the US may change their tar­gets and come to Ja­pan in­stead.”</p>
    <p>This has, in turn, fu­elled con­cerns within the Ja­panese gov­ern­ment that stick­ing to the sta­tus quo would hin­der the mil­i­tary co­op­er­a­tion of the two se­cu­rity al­lies, as well as joint tech­no­log­i­cal re­search be­tween uni­ver­si­ties in the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Both the US and Aus­tralia have al­leged a sys­tem­atic and strate­gic cam­paign waged by China to steal tech­nol­ogy and in­tel­li­gence through the de­ploy­ment of grad­u­ate stu­dents and re­searchers.</p>
    <p>They, along­side Ja­pan and In­dia, are part of the Quad bloc of coun­tries that are lead­ing the Free and Open Indo-Pa­cific vi­sion that was mooted as a coun­ter­weight to Chi­nese as­sertive­ness.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese For­eign Min­is­ter Toshim­itsu Motegi will host a meet­ing with his Quad coun­ter­parts to­day, in what will be the first face-to­face mul­ti­lat­eral high-level con­fer­ence in Tokyo since the Covid-19 pan­demic started.</p>
    <p>China is set to be high on the agenda at the talks, which will be at­tended by US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo, Aus­tralian For­eign Min­is­ter Marise Payne and In­dian Ex­ter­nal Af­fairs Min­is­ter Subrah­manyam Jais­hankar.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, Washington re­voked the visas of more than 1,000 Chi­nese na­tion­als and said it will also sus­pend the en­try of those it deems as se­cu­rity risks, a move which Bei­jing called a vi­o­la­tion of hu­man rights.</p>
    <p>The US State De­part­ment em­pha­sised that the in­el­i­gi­ble “high-risk grad­u­ate stu­dents and re­search schol­ars” were but “a small sub­set” of the 360,000 Chi­nese who are in the US for study and re­search, stress­ing that those who pass back­ground checks will still be wel­comed.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions are also high be­tween China and Aus­tralia, with the two na­tions ac­cus­ing each other of jeop­ar­dis­ing the safety of their out sta­tioned jour­nal­ists.</p>
    <p>Can­berra has also stripped at least two Chi­nese schol­ar­ship hold­ers of their visas.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan will con­duct more vig­or­ous back­ground checks so as to suss out sus­pi­cious per­sons, the Yomi­uri report said, through var­i­ous mea­sures, in­clud­ing build­ing a sys­tem that al­lows for in­ter-min­istry ac­cess to in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The For­eign Min­istry has re­quested a bud­get of 220 mil­lion yen (S$2.8 mil­lion) for the next fis­cal year, for mea­sures re­lated to these stricter ex­am­i­na­tions.</p>
