    <p>MICHELLE YEOH GETS SWABBED: Malaysian ac­tress Michelle Yeoh (above) is known for play­ing tough char­ac­ters in ac­tion flicks such as Crouch­ing Tiger, Hid­den Dragon (2000).</p>
    <p>But the 57-year-old turned from feisty to fear­ful when she re­cently took a swab test for the coro­n­avirus after trav­el­ling to Aus­tralia for work.</p>
    <p>Yeoh, who lives with her French part­ner, In­ter­na­tional Au­to­mo­bile Fed­er­a­tion chief Jean Todt, 74, has been un­der lock­down in Paris dur­ing the pan­demic. On July 17, she re­vealed on so­cial me­dia that she was head­ing to Syd­ney for work and posted a photo of her­self wear­ing a face mask, face shield, gog­gles and a hat at the air­port.</p>
    <p>In an­other post on July 21, she said she would be deal­ing with her up­com­ing Covid-19 swab test like Em­peror Ge­or­giou, the char­ac­ter she played in TV se­ries Star Trek: Dis­cov­ery (2017 to present) and Eleanor, the tough mother she played in the movie Crazy Rich Asians (2018). On Wednes­day, she posted a photo of her­self un­der­go­ing the nasal swab, with her gri­mac­ing.</p>
    <p>“2nd test, sorry so wimpy,” she wrote, adding that she had four more days left to her quar­an­tine. The post was ac­com­pa­nied by a photo of a sump­tu­ous meal which in­cluded chilli crab with man­tou.</p>
