    <p>•</p>
    <p>LON­DON France has placed cities on max­i­mum alert and yes­ter­day or­dered many to close all bars, gyms and sports cen­tres. Italy and Poland have made masks com­pul­sory in pub­lic. The Czech Repub­lic has de­clared a state of emer­gency, and Ger­man of­fi­cials fear new out­breaks could soon grow be­yond the con­trol of their vaunted test­ing and tracing.</p>
    <p>Across Europe and be­yond, Covid-19 has come roar­ing back and, as hap­pened last spring, of­fi­cials are in­vok­ing re­stric­tions to try to sup­press it. But this time is dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>Still reel­ing from the eco­nomic, emo­tional and phys­i­cal toll of na­tion­wide lock­downs that brought the con­ti­nent to a vir­tual stand­still, govern­ment of­fi­cials are find­ing that the pub­lic might not be so com­pli­ant the sec­ond time around.</p>
    <p>In some places, new re­stric­tions are ac­cepted, al­beit grudg­ingly, be­cause the al­ter­na­tive – new na­tion­wide lock­downs – would only be worse. But there is widen­ing scep­ti­cism that the pub­lic would even go along with such a dras­tic step.</p>
    <p>In­stead, as ex­haus­tion and frus­tra­tion with pan­demic re­stric­tions set in, gov­ern­ments are try­ing to thread a nar­row­ing course be­tween keep­ing the virus in check and what their publics and economies will tol­er­ate.</p>
    <p>That is es­pe­cially so in democ­ra­cies, where gov­ern­ments are ul­ti­mately an­swer­able to the vot­ers.</p>
    <p>“It is go­ing to be a lot more dif­fi­cult this time,” said Dr Cor­nelia Betsch, Heisen­berg professor of health com­mu­ni­ca­tion at Er­furt Univer­sity in Ger­many, cit­ing “pan­demic fa­tigue”.</p>
    <p>As the cri­sis deep­ens, the on­cesolid con­sen­sus in many coun­tries to join in sac­ri­fices to com­bat the virus is show­ing signs of frac­tur­ing. New rules are chal­lenged in courts. Na­tional and lo­cal lead­ers are spar­ring.</p>
    <p>In Spain, the govern­ment on Fri­day de­creed a state of emer­gency in</p>
    <p>the Madrid area. The step was taken over the heads of the high­est re­gional court and ob­ject­ing lo­cal politi­cians, and within hours, the na­tion’s main op­po­si­tion leader called on the prime min­is­ter to ap­pear in Par­lia­ment to jus­tify it.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic scep­ti­cism is fu­elled in many coun­tries by the fail­ure of gov­ern­ments to ful­fil grand prom­ises on mea­sures like con­tact tracing.</p>
    <p>In per­haps the most telling in­di­ca­tion that peo­ple are ei­ther con­fused or done lis­ten­ing to guid­ance, the num­ber of cases con­tin­ues to ex­plode, in­clud­ing in places where new mea­sures have al­ready been pro­mul­gated.</p>
    <p>Por­tu­gal or­dered new re­stric­tions last month, but yes­ter­day recorded 1,646 new cases, the high­est daily fig­ure since the start of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In north­ern Eng­land, where new rules have come and gone and come again, the most tan­gi­ble re­sult has been the sow­ing of con­fu­sion, not slow­ing the con­ta­gion.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials are now warn­ing that hos­pi­tals could face a greater flood of pa­tients than at the height of the pan­demic in April.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion on Thurs­day an­nounced a record one-day in­crease in global coro­n­avirus cases. Europe, as a re­gion, was re­port­ing more cases than In­dia, Brazil or the United States.</p>
    <p>In Brus­sels, Euro­pean Union com­mis­sioner Mariya Gabriel said yes­ter­day she had tested pos­i­tive for the virus, making her the first top Brus­sels of­fi­cial known to have been in­fected.</p>
    <p>The pit­fall of im­pos­ing stricter new mea­sures has al­ready been wit­nessed in Is­rael, the only coun­try to or­der a sec­ond na­tion­wide lock­down. It has led to chaos and ram­pant protests.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple view the de­ci­sions as po­lit­i­cal and not health-based,” said Mr Ishay Hadas, a protest or­gan­iser in Is­rael.</p>
    <p>While is­sues around mask wear­ing and other pru­dent mea­sures re­main far less politi­cised in Europe, es­pe­cially com­pared with Amer­ica, the prospect of a win­ter un­der tight re­stric­tions or even lock­downs is stir­ring new frus­tra­tion and di­vid­ing po­lit­i­cal par­ties.</p>
    <p>With Bri­tain ex­pected to­mor­row to an­nounce even more sweep­ing mea­sures – many of them fo­cused on curbs on drink­ing and carous­ing – the leader of the op­po­si­tion Labour Party, Mr Keir Starmer, has chal­lenged the govern­ment to pro­duce any sci­en­tific ev­i­dence show­ing that early pub clos­ings help slow trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple are very con­fused,” said Professor Robert West, a health psy­chol­ogy ex­pert at Univer­sity Col­lege Lon­don. “I couldn’t put my hand on my heart and say I know what the rules are.”</p>
