    <p>While the Yel­low Rib­bon Pri­son Run will not be held this year due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, there are still ded­i­cated folks across the is­land in­tent on spread­ing its mes­sage of re­newal and re­demp­tion.</p>
    <p>Take, for in­stance, pri­vate-hire car driver Isam Su­long, who spent al­most eight years be­hind bars for drug-re­lated of­fences be­fore be­ing re­leased in 2014.</p>
    <p>Mr Isam, 50, took part in his first Yel­low Rib­bon Pri­son Run last year, and now spreads the mes­sage through his own means and vol­un­teer work with the Yel­low Rib­bon Com­mu­nity Project’s (YRCP) Wood­lands di­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>He has been help­ing oth­ers as well, such as by check­ing in with friends and shar­ing his per­sonal ex­pe­ri­ence of hav­ing been in­car­cer­ated to re­mind them to stay away from drugs.</p>
    <p>Mr Isam also gave mo­ti­va­tional talks and gui­tar lessons for ben­e­fi­cia­ries with the YRCP di­vi­sion be­fore the pan­demic struck.</p>
    <p>The an­nual run, which at­tracted 10,000 par­tic­i­pants last year, is part of the Yel­low Rib­bon Project’s (YRP) ef­forts to spread the mes­sage of se­cond chances and hope for for­mer of­fend­ers and their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>Mr Jabez Koh, 45, had been look­ing for­ward to the event to catch up with some friends.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh, who was sen­tenced to 24 years’ jail in 1997 for drug-re­lated of­fences, has taken part in every run since be­ing re­leased on re­mis­sion in Fe­bru­ary 2013.</p>
    <p>He had also en­cour­aged staff and their fam­i­lies from his trans­port and lo­gis­tics com­pany In­fi­nite Trans­ports to par­tic­i­pate.</p>
    <p>“It’s a good cause so I told my­self I have to par­tic­i­pate every year. I re­ceived a lot of sup­port through the YRP and I know its ben­e­fits, which helped bring me to where I am to­day,” said Mr Koh, who noted that around 90 per cent of the 30-odd em­ploy­ees in his com­pany are for­mer of­fend­ers.</p>
    <p>“I faced dis­crim­i­na­tion my­self when I came out from pri­son, so that mo­ti­vated me to set up my own busi­ness and then help other ex-of­fend­ers get started,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh’s com­pany has helped dis­trib­ute 150 YRP care pack­ages and su­per­mar­ket vouch­ers to house­holds af­fected by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>A YRP spokesman said that many sup­port­ers have stepped for­ward to pro­vide wel­fare-re­lated as­sis­tance and other sup­port needed to in­mates, for­mer of­fend­ers and their fam­i­lies, as well as oth­ers af­fected by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>She added: “To­gether with our part­ners, in­mates and ex-of­fend­ers came to­gether col­lec­tively to pro­duce and dis­trib­ute 6,000 pack­ets of cook­ies for front-line work­ers, more than 3,500 re­us­able face masks and 1,427 mask pouches for the com­mu­nity, as well as to pro­vide 260 care packs to vul­ner­a­ble groups such as the el­derly and the chil­dren of in­mates.”</p>
    <p>The Yel­low Rib­bon Fund is pre­par­ing to hold on­line fund-rais­ing events like an auc­tion of art­works cre­ated by in­mates and items do­nated by the fund’s part­ners.</p>
    <p>The pro­ceeds will sup­port for­mer of­fend­ers and their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>Pri­son of­fi­cer Tan Chee Kian, who was in­volved in or­gan­is­ing the run for the past two years, said he had seen how the YRP ben­e­fited in­mates and for­mer of­fend­ers, help­ing them to rein­te­grate and be con­tribut­ing mem­bers of so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant Su­per­in­ten­dent of Pris­ons Tan is dis­ap­pointed that the run is off this year: “It is re­ally mean­ing­ful... as it can re­ally al­low the pub­lic to en­gage and come into con­tact with the ex-of­fend­ers and un­der­stand them bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>The 32-year-old con­tin­ues to share videos on so­cial me­dia to get those around him to un­der­stand the sto­ries of the for­mer of­fend­ers and to ac­cept them into the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“The aware­ness and shar­ing of the mes­sage is re­ally im­por­tant.”</p>
