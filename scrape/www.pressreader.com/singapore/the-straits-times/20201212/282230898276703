    <p>In a bid to land a part-time teach­ing job at an in­ter­na­tional school, a 30-year-old man forged a Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) de­gree cer­tifi­cate, even though he had not com­pleted his stud­ies at the univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese na­tional Xie Xin was fined $4,000 yes­ter­day, af­ter plead­ing guilty to one count of fraud­u­lently us­ing a forged doc­u­ment as a gen­uine one.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments state that Xie, a Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent, was ad­mit­ted as an NUS stu­dent on Aug 1, 2011, but with­drew from his stud­ies on April 18, 2016.</p>
    <p>Around the mid­dle of that year, Xie down­loaded an image of an NUS cer­tifi­cate for a com­puter en­gi­neer­ing de­gree and in­serted his name onto it us­ing Pho­to­shop.</p>
    <p>He was re­in­stated as a stu­dent af­ter a suc­cess­ful ap­peal on Jan 13, 2017, but was aca­dem­i­cally dis­missed about five months later af­ter fail­ing to meet exam reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>On Nov 14, 2018, Xie ap­plied in per­son for a part-time teach­ing job at As­cen­sia In­ter­na­tional School and was in­ter­viewed by a mem­ber of its staff.</p>
    <p>The next day, he sub­mit­ted the de­gree cer­tifi­cate he had forged to the school, in sup­port of his job ap­pli­ca­tion and in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>Xie later ac­cepted a con­tract of ser­vice from the school for the pe­riod be­tween Nov 15, 2018, and Dec 31, 2019.</p>
    <p>On Feb 14 last year, he was told by a hu­man re­sources ex­ec­u­tive from As­cen­sia to sign a doc­u­ment called “Lec­turer Dec­la­ra­tion Form and Ver­i­fi­ca­tion of Cer­tifi­cate Au­then­tic­ity”.</p>
    <p>But he hes­i­tated and asked if he could use his A-level cer­tifi­cate as part of his job ap­pli­ca­tion in­stead of the forged de­gree cer­tifi­cate.</p>
    <p>He sub­mit­ted a state­ment to the school four days later, say­ing he had not com­pleted his fi­nal-year project at NUS and had not “fully grad­u­ated yet” but would fin­ish his stud­ies when ready.</p>
    <p>The ex­ec­u­tive then con­tacted NUS to ver­ify the au­then­tic­ity of Xie’s de­gree cer­tifi­cate.</p>
    <p>The univer­sity replied that the forged doc­u­ment did not match any of its grad­u­ates’ records.</p>
    <p>A po­lice re­port was made on March 5 last year and Xie was dis­missed from the school on March 14.</p>
    <p>Xie ini­tially told the po­lice that the forged cer­tifi­cate was a pho­to­graph of the orig­i­nal one shown to him by an NUS staff mem­ber, but later ad­mit­ted to the forgery.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, As­cen­sia may still have hired Xie if he had sub­mit­ted his valid A-level cer­tifi­cate, though on a lower salary scale.</p>
