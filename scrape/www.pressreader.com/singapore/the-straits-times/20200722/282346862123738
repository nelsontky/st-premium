    <p>Us­ing wear­ables for Covid-19 contact trac­ing has been in the news, with 10,000 se­niors here given the first batch of the TraceTo­gether to­kens ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>How­ever, re­searchers and tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies around the world, in­clud­ing those in Singapore, are find­ing an­other re­lated ap­pli­ca­tion for wear­ables, or wear­able tech­nol­ogy de­vices – to mon­i­tor and de­tect Covid-19, in­clud­ing at an early stage be­fore its symp­toms sur­face.</p>
    <p>Fin­land-based smart-ring maker Oura grabbed head­lines last month when the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) in the United States said it would pro­vide NBA play­ers and staff with Oura’s smart rings for the restart of the sea­son, which will be­gin at the end of the month.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers from the West Vir­ginia Univer­sity Rock­e­feller Neu­ro­science In­sti­tute said in April that the Oura ring has been successful in recog­nis­ing Covid-19 symp­toms up to three days in ad­vance with 90 per cent ac­cu­racy.</p>
    <p>Fit­ness wear­ables firms Garmin and Fit­bit re­cently announced ef­forts to har­ness the data col­lected by their smart­watches and fit­ness track­ers to de­tect Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the ef­forts in Singapore have so far been fo­cused on in­house in­stead of off-the-shelf wear­ables.</p>
    <p>Home-grown med­i­cal tech­nol­ogy start-up Re­spiree, a spin-off from the Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search (A*Star), has been work­ing with the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal (NUH) and Na­tional Univer­sity of Singapore Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (NUS Medicine) since March to de­velop pre­dic­tive mod­els us­ing res­pi­ra­tory rate and breath­ing vari­abil­ity, to de­tect clin­i­cal de­te­ri­o­ra­tion in pa­tients suf­fer­ing from acute res­pi­ra­tory fail­ure and pneu­mo­nia. The aim: to de­ploy res­pi­ra­tory bio-mark­ers to pre­dict wors­en­ing con­di­tions in Covid-19 pa­tients in iso­la­tion rooms.</p>
    <p>For the hos­pi­tal tri­als, the Re­spiree so­lu­tion uses two wear­ables, one at­tached to the chest and the other clipped over a fin­ger, to mea­sure vi­tal pa­ram­e­ters such as res­pi­ra­tory rate, breath­ing-pat­tern vari­abil­ity and pulse oxime­try or blood oxy­gen level. The data from pa­tients in iso­lated rooms are sent wire­lessly to a uni­fied dash­board in real time ev­ery five min­utes.</p>
    <p>NUS Medicine as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor Lee Pyng, who is also a se­nior con­sul­tant in NUH’s res­pi­ra­tory and crit­i­cal care medicine di­vi­sion, says the al­go­rithms that de­tect clin­i­cal de­te­ri­o­ra­tion in­cor­po­rate depth of breath­ing – which is not a pa­ram­e­ter the hos­pi­tal rou­tinely mea­sures – as well as res­pi­ra­tory rate to im­prove the sen­si­tiv­ity of de­tec­tion. She says that in this in­stance, man­ual mon­i­tor­ing of res­pi­ra­tory and pulse rates “is not ac­cu­rate” as health­care work­ers take mea­sure­ments ev­ery four hours com­pared with the wear­ables’ con­tin­u­ous mea­sure­ment.</p>
    <p>She says the abil­ity to iden­tify Covid-19 pa­tients at risk of clin­i­cal de­te­ri­o­ra­tion ahead of time will aid physi­cians in the cor­rect sit­ing of care for these pa­tients, such as in­ten­sive care or high de­pen­dency units for closer mon­i­tor­ing, as well as the ad­min­is­tra­tion of ther­a­pies in a timely fashion, which can save lives.</p>
    <p>Dr Gur­preet Singh, founder of Re­spiree and se­nior re­search fel­low at A*Star’s Singapore Bioimag­ing Con­sor­tium, adds that in addition, nurses can now mon­i­tor pa­tient vi­tals with­out need­ing to enter iso­lated rooms, thus mit­i­gat­ing their risk of in­fec­tion and sav­ing on per­sonal pro­tec­tive gear.</p>
    <p>Re­spiree has re­ceived ap­proval from the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity for the use of its de­vices in Singapore and is in the process of se­cur­ing ap­proval from the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion to com­mer­cialise its prod­uct glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Home-grown smart wear­ables firm KaHa is also us­ing in-house wear­ables, in the form of wrist bands, to mon­i­tor pa­tients re­motely and con­tin­u­ously, with­out the need for a care­giver to be in close contact.</p>
    <p>The so­lu­tion uses ma­chine-learn­ing al­go­rithms that process large and con­tin­u­ous data sets such as body tem­per­a­ture, heart rate, blood pres­sure, sleep lev­els and blood oxy­gen lev­els (SpO2), says KaHa’s founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Pawan Gandhi.</p>
    <p>KaHa’s wrist bands can be used pre- and post-hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion to pro­vide vi­tal health data out­side of hos­pi­tal premises for pre­ven­tive care. The com­pany’s wear­ables and solutions have been de­ployed for back-to-work and back-to-school ini­tia­tives in Switzer­land, the US, In­dia and Singapore, says Mr Gandhi.</p>
    <p>“Mov­ing for­ward, we plan to take</p>
    <p>This can dras­ti­cally im­prove the pan­demic pub­lic health re­sponse as the wear­able de­vices can no­tify users of po­ten­tial Covid-19 ex­po­sure, help users fol­low social dis­tanc­ing re­quire­ments, en­hance re­mote pa­tient mon­i­tor­ing, de­tect gen­eral pat­terns and iden­tify ge­o­graph­i­cal hot spots. ’’</p>
    <p>MS ALIYAH FAROUK, med­i­cal de­vice an­a­lyst at data an­a­lyt­ics and con­sult­ing firm Glob­alData, on data col­lected from wear­able de­vices be­ing used to de­tect early signs of Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>this to end users in a few coun­tries for faster and eas­ier ac­cess,” he says.</p>
    <p>IM­PACT OF CON­SUMER WEAR­ABLES</p>
    <p>While be­spoke wear­ables can be im­por­tant tools to de­tect Covid-19, it might be off-the-shelf wear­ables that could make a larger im­pact on a broad scale.</p>
    <p>Ms Aliyah Farouk, med­i­cal de­vice an­a­lyst at data an­a­lyt­ics and con­sult­ing firm Glob­alData, says data col­lected from such wear­able de­vices can be used to de­tect early signs of Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>“This can dras­ti­cally im­prove the pan­demic pub­lic health re­sponse as the wear­able de­vices can no­tify users of po­ten­tial Covid-19 ex­po­sure, help users fol­low social dis­tanc­ing re­quire­ments, en­hance re­mote pa­tient mon­i­tor­ing, de­tect gen­eral pat­terns and iden­tify ge­o­graph­i­cal hot spots,” she says.</p>
    <p>Mr Ken­neth Liew, as­so­ciate re­search di­rec­tor at re­search firm IDC Asia Pa­cific, says the key ad­van­tage of us­ing con­sumer-grade wear­ables is that it is eas­ier to get mass adop­tion. “The plat­forms of these wear­ables are also gen­er­ally more es­tab­lished than those that are newly built,” he says.</p>
    <p>Fit­bit announced in April its col­lab­o­ra­tion with Scripps Re­search Trans­la­tional In­sti­tute and Stan­ford Medicine in us­ing Fit­bit data to help de­tect, track and con­tain in­fec­tious diseases like Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Dr Eric Topol, di­rec­tor and founder of Scripps Re­search Trans­la­tional In­sti­tute, said in a state­ment that “from our pre­vi­ously pub­lished work, we know that data col­lected from con­sumer wear­ables can sig­nif­i­cantly im­prove the pre­dic­tion of in­fluenza-like ill­ness”.</p>
    <p>The Stan­ford Health­care In­no­va­tion Lab launched its Covid-19 wear­ables study in April to es­tab­lish whether data col­lected from wear­ables, in­clud­ing those from Ap­ple, Sam­sung, Fit­bit, Oura and Garmin, can be used to pre­dict the on­set of an in­fec­tious dis­ease such as Covid-19 be­fore the symp­toms start. The study is look­ing for vol­un­teers in the US.</p>
    <p>Last month, Garmin announced that it is part­ner­ing non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion Phys­ioQ to pro­vide data for Covid-19 re­search.</p>
    <p>On an opt-in ba­sis, Garmin smart­watch users world­wide can choose to share their tracked health statis­tics, such as heart rate and SpO2, with Phys­ioQ’s app called Neo, which will help re­searchers iden­tify trends help­ful in the larger fight against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Data from Phys­ioQ has been used by re­searchers in top US med­i­cal in­sti­tu­tions, in­clud­ing Har­vard Univer­sity, Berke­ley Univer­sity, Bos­ton Univer­sity, McGill Univer­sity and Mas­sachusetts Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal Re­search In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>Dr An­drew Ahn, as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor of medicine and ra­di­ol­ogy at Har­vard Med­i­cal School, says: “Many diseases, not just Covid-19, are asymp­to­matic, es­pe­cially in the beginning stages. This would mean po­ten­tial pa­tients don’t know they have the dis­ease or the pre­cur­sor to the dis­ease. How­ever, wear­able met­rics can help to find many of these is­sues.”</p>
    <p>Dr Ahn adds that the re­search on Covid-19 is con­cen­trated on hos­pi­talised pa­tients and lit­tle is known about cases out­side of the hos­pi­tal. “There may also be un­for­tu­nate cases where in­di­vid­u­als suf­fer an un­timely death due to Covid-19 with­out reach­ing the hos­pi­tal. As a re­sult, data col­lected in hos­pi­tals is con­trolled and usu­ally cleaner, but also skewed,” he says.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, wear­ables al­low round-the-clock data col­lec­tion, giv­ing re­searchers a win­dow into one’s health and habits, he says.</p>
    <p>How­ever, ac­cess and cost will be is­sues in us­ing con­sumer wear­ables in fight­ing Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“The geri­atric pop­u­la­tion – the group most af­fected by Covid-19 – are typ­i­cally less ex­pe­ri­enced with tech­nol­ogy. Fur­ther­more, the high cost of some wear­ables de­vices may de­ter con­sumers from buy­ing them,” says Ms Farouk.</p>
    <p>An­other con­cern is pri­vacy. “As wear­ables of­ten col­lect data us­ing cloud stor­age sys­tems, they can be vul­ner­a­ble to cy­ber­at­tack,” she warns.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic re­la­tions as­so­ciate Tabitha Ong, 25, who uses a Garmin smart­watch, be­lieves the ad­van­tages out­weigh the concerns.</p>
    <p>“Hon­estly, there is a part of me that is wor­ried about what my data will be used for and if it will be safe. But if con­tribut­ing my data will help in Covid-19 re­search and the greater good, I don’t see why I should not con­trib­ute,” she says.</p>
