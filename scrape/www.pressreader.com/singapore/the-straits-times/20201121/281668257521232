    <p>In a state­ment posted on Face­book by her hus­band Lee Hsien Yang yes­ter­day, se­nior lawyer Lee Suet Fern said she dis­agreed with the court’s de­ci­sion to sus­pend her from prac­tice for 15 months.</p>
    <p>A Court of Three Judges meted out the sus­pen­sion af­ter find­ing that Mrs Lee was guilty of mis­con­duct un­be­fit­ting an ad­vo­cate and so­lic­i­tor for her role in the han­dling of the last will of her fa­ther-in-law Lee Kuan Yew in De­cem­ber 2013.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lee said in the state­ment: “There was no ba­sis for this case to have even been ini­ti­ated.</p>
    <p>“This was a pri­vate will. Lee Kuan Yew knew what he wanted. He got what he wanted. The Court of Three did not find that he was of un­sound mind or that he was not in con­trol.</p>
    <p>“He made the de­ci­sion to re­vert to his land­mark 2011 will fol­low­ing dis­cus­sions with his lawyer Kwa Kim Li be­fore I was tasked to find a wit­ness.</p>
    <p>“Any­one can re­voke their own will while they are alive. If this will was not what Lee Kuan Yew wanted, he could eas­ily have made an­other, as he had done sev­eral times be­fore,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lee added that no com­plaint had been lodged by Mr Lee Kuan Yew, any of his ben­e­fi­cia­ries or Ms Kwa Kim Li, the lawyer who pre­pared his var­i­ous wills.</p>
    <p>Rather, the case arose from a com­plaint years later by the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers, she said.</p>
    <p>She noted that her brother-in­law, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong, “made ex­ten­sive sub­mis­sions, but did not present him­self as a wit­ness and was not sub­ject to cross-ex­am­i­na­tion”.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lee em­pha­sised that the court found there was no so­lic­i­tor­client re­la­tion­ship be­tween her and her fa­ther-in-law, and that there was no dis­hon­esty in her deal­ings with Mr Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
    <p>There was also no find­ing that the will was pro­cured by fraud or un­due in­flu­ence, and pro­bate for Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s will had been granted by the courts in 2015, she added.</p>
    <p>The sus­pen­sion means that Mrs Lee, a lawyer of 37 years’ stand­ing, can­not prac­tise as a lawyer in Sin­ga­pore for 15 months.</p>
    <p>Checks by The Straits Times show that she is reg­is­tered in Hong Kong as a for­eign lawyer.</p>
    <p>It is not im­me­di­ately clear if and how her sus­pen­sion in Sin­ga­pore will af­fect her reg­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Lawyers in­ter­viewed by The Straits Times said the sus­pen­sion cov­ers only her prac­tis­ing cer­tifi­cate in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a lawyer, who did not want to be named, said there have been cases in which Sin­ga­pore lawyers prac­tis­ing in other ju­ris­dic­tions have kept the Law So­ci­ety here in­formed about their le­gal trou­ble over­seas.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Hong Kong Le­gal Prac­ti­tioner’s Or­di­nance, a per­son must be in good stand­ing in the for­eign ju­ris­dic­tion they come from to qual­ify to prac­tise law in the ter­ri­tory.</p>
