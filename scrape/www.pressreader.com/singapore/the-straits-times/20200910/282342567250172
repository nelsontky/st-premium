    <p>LON­DON • Eigh­teen years af­ter for­mer Manch­ester United man­ager Alex Ferguson claimed that his great­est chal­lenge had been “knock­ing Liver­pool right off their perch”, Jur­gen Klopp’s men have re­turned to the top of English foot­ball.</p>
    <p>The chal­lenge is stay­ing there. In end­ing their 30-year wait for an English top-flight ti­tle, Liver­pool now have the op­por­tu­nity to match United’s record as 20-time win­ners this sea­son and come full cir­cle to the pre-Ferguson era when they were the coun­try’s dom­i­nant team in the 1970s and 80s.</p>
    <p>Last term, the Reds were ut­terly ruth­less, wrap­ping up the ti­tle with a record seven games to spare, fin­ish­ing 18 points ahead of near­est chal­lengers Manch­ester City and re­main­ing un­beaten at An­field for a third straight cam­paign.</p>
    <p>The world cham­pi­ons will still be the team to beat this cam­paign but it is a uni­ver­sal sport­ing truth, par­tic­u­larly in English foot­ball, that re­tain­ing the ti­tle is harder than win­ning it. In the Premier League’s 28-year his­tory, it has been re­tained only eight times – six by United and once each by City and Chelsea.</p>
    <p>Be­fore Pep Guardi­ola’s men did so last year, the Red Devils were the last to achieve that feat in 2008, with Jose Mour­inho once claim­ing the dif­fer­ence be­tween one-off win­ners and se­rial cham­pi­ons was a ques­tion of men­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>Un­der Klopp, Liver­pool are un­likely to have a prob­lem with mo­ti­va­tion. Look­ing ahead to the new sea­son, he told Sky Sports: “As long as we stay hum­ble and greedy, we have a good chance to re­main a re­ally un­com­fort­able op­po­nent...</p>
    <p>“Next sea­son, you can write sto­ries about us be­ing the de­fend­ing cham­pi­ons but... we will not de­fend any­thing, we will at­tack it.”</p>
    <p>There will be re­newed chal­lenges from their main ri­vals City as well as Chelsea and United, all of whom out­spent Liver­pool.</p>
    <p>Pun­dits like Graeme Souness and Jamie Red­knapp have ex­pressed dis­ap­point­ment at the lack of trans­fer ac­tiv­ity at their for­mer club. But that should not come as a sur­prise. Last sum­mer, Klopp was sim­i­larly quiet, mov­ing only for a hand­ful of young­sters.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man used just 24 play­ers last term and, bar­ring the po­ten­tial sign­ing of Bay­ern Mu­nich’s Thi­ago Al­can­tara, he is set to keep faith with the same squad that won the Club World Cup and league ti­tle.</p>
    <p>Un­like their ri­vals, who are at dif­fer­ent stages of tran­si­tion, Liver­pool ap­pear to be the fin­ished ar­ti­cle. Per­haps they could do with more com­pe­ti­tion for places, but the ca­pac­ity for im­prove­ment is what sets them apart.</p>
    <p>Andy Robert­son and Trent Alexan­der-Arnold con­tinue to rein­vent what it means to be full-backs in the mod­ern game – only City’s Kevin de Bruyne had more as­sists than the pair – and the Reds’ de­fence is primed to be the mean­est for the third con­sec­u­tive year.</p>
    <p>There is also an ex­pec­ta­tion at An­field that Takumi Mi­namino is ready to stamp his mark on English foot­ball. The Ja­pan for­ward has been one of their best play­ers in pre-sea­son and Klopp has hinted that with nine months to adapt since his trans­fer, the 25-year-old is push­ing for a start­ing place.</p>
    <p>They also have a promis­ing crop of academy grad­u­ates break­ing through – in par­tic­u­lar the trio of Neco Wil­liams, 19, Har­vey El­liot, 17, and Cur­tis Jones, 19.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool face a tricky start to their ti­tle de­fence, host­ing newly pro­moted Leeds be­fore fac­ing Chelsea and Arse­nal in quick suc­ces­sion, but it is hard to dis­lodge them as favourites.</p>
    <p>With fans set to re­turn to sta­di­ums later this year, there will not be a bet­ter driv­ing force than lift­ing their 20th league tro­phy.</p>
    <p>The Nether­lands in­ter­na­tional can also play at left-back, an­other prob­lem po­si­tion for City, or as a de­fen­sive mid­fielder.</p>
    <p>But it is Napoli star Kali­dou Koulibaly who could be the cru­cial piece in Guardi­ola’s jig­saw.</p>
    <p>City are re­port­edly in ne­go­ti­a­tions to sign the €75 mil­lion-rated (S$121 mil­lion) cen­tre-back.</p>
    <p>Although the 29-year-old is un­likely to re­tain much sell-on value, he will be able to make the in­stant im­pact City re­quire.</p>
    <p>Sevilla’s Diego Car­los, 27 – an­other player in his prime – and Atletico Madrid’s Jose Gimenez are re­port­edly al­ter­na­tive op­tions.</p>
    <p>La­porte, lim­ited to 15 league ap­pear­ances last sea­son, is al­ready a doubt for City’s opener against Wolves on Sept 21, a de­layed start due to their Euro­pean in­volve­ment in a coro­n­avirus-af­fected sea­son.</p>
    <p>The French­man and Mahrez have tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 and are self-iso­lat­ing.</p>
    <p>Like sev­enth-placed Wolves last term, City suf­fered nine league de­feats.</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola, in analysing why Liver­pool beat his side to the ti­tle, pin­pointed City’s lack of con­sis­tency.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing short­com­ings and re­bound­ing from dis­ap­point­ment – as he did in 2017 – has al­lowed him to re­fo­cus.</p>
    <p>Yet re­build­ing and re-mo­ti­vat­ing a tal­ent-laden squad is un­charted ter­ri­tory for Guardi­ola as he heads into the fi­nal year of his con­tract at the Eti­had.</p>
    <p>“It’s a chal­lenge for me, I’ve never done five years at one club and also the chal­lenge to see if we can main­tain the lev­els that we have in the pre­vi­ous sea­sons,” said the Spa­niard.</p>
    <p>A third league ti­tle in four sea­sons could per­suade him to stay – and Messi to ar­rive.</p>
