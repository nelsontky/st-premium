    <p>Google’s Pixel 4a plays it safe while of­fer­ing the best value for a Google smart­phone since the Nexus 5 back in 2013.</p>
    <p>Like its Pixel 3a pre­de­ces­sor, the mid-range Pixel 4a dis­tils the Google Pixel smart­phone ex­pe­ri­ence – ex­cel­lent cam­era, clean Google-cen­tric ver­sion of An­droid and three years of soft­ware up­dates – into a more af­ford­able pack­age than the flag­ship model (Pixel 4).</p>
    <p>With the cur­rent eco­nomic un­cer­tainty, the Pixel 4a’s launch price ($499) cer­tainly hits the spot. It is more af­ford­able than the Pixel 3a (from $659) and Ap­ple’s bud­get iPhone SE (from $649).</p>
    <p>Of course, Google had to cut some fea­tures to hit this price point. But you prob­a­bly will not miss most of them.</p>
    <p>I would have liked the Pixel 4a to be more than just splash-re­sis­tant. But I can live with­out the wire­less charg­ing, face un­lock and mo­tion ges­ture fea­tures that did not make the cut from Pixel 4.</p>
    <p>In fact, I am more than de­lighted with Pixel 4a’s rear fin­ger­print sen­sor. It is not as flashy as an in­dis­play fin­ger­print sen­sor or hands­free like face recog­ni­tion. But it is re­li­able and works when you are wear­ing a face mask.</p>
    <p>I am also glad the Pixel 4a has a head­phone jack and stereo speak­ers. Wire­less head­phones are con­ve­nient – un­til they run out of bat­tery when I for­get to charge them.</p>
    <p>Like the Pixel 3a, the Pixel 4a has a plas­tic body that is per­ceived as less premium than the glass ones in flag­ship smart­phones.</p>
    <p>But this poly­car­bon­ate uni­body chas­sis does not feel cheap. Its matt fin­ish looks good and is not as slip­pery as glass-backed smart­phones.</p>
    <p>While the Pixel 3a came in two screen sizes (with the 5.6-inch Pixel 3a and 6-inch Pixel 3a XL), there is just a sin­gle Pixel 4a model with a 5.8-inch Oled screen pro­tected by Corn­ing Go­rilla Glass 3.</p>
    <p>Sur­round­ing this dis­play are slim bezels. To­gether with a punch-hole selfie cam­era, the Pixel 4a looks more con­tem­po­rary than the Pixel 4, which has a chunky top bezel. Pick one of Google’s new Pixel 4a wall­pa­pers and this tiny punch­hole vir­tu­ally blends into the back­ground.</p>
    <p>On a prac­ti­cal note, the slim bezels also en­sure that the Pixel 4a is com­pact and suit­able to use with one hand. But I am dis­ap­pointed the phone is avail­able only in black as I re­ally like the or­ange op­tion in­tro­duced with the Pixel 4.</p>
    <p>While the Pixel 4a’s dis­play has a stan­dard 1,080p screen res­o­lu­tion, it looks about as bright as the one on the Pixel 4. High dy­namic range (HDR) is sup­ported on this screen.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Pixel 4’s am­bi­ent EQ fea­ture, which ad­justs the dis­play’s colour tem­per­a­ture ac­cord­ing to am­bi­ent light­ing – sim­i­lar to Ap­ple’s TrueTone fea­ture – is miss­ing.</p>
    <p>The Pixel 4a eas­ily has the best cam­era in any mid-range phone to­day. It will even give top phones a run for their money, which is not sur­pris­ing since the Pixel 4a has the same 12.2-megapixel cam­era as the main cam­era of the flag­ship Pixel 4.</p>
    <p>It also has all the cam­era fea­tures of the lat­ter, in­clud­ing Night Sight (Google’s ex­cel­lent long-ex­po­sure low-light mode), dual ex­po­sure con­trols and Fre­quent Faces, which rec­om­mends shots with peo­ple that you fre­quently pho­to­graph.</p>
    <p>Pixel 4, though, has a sec­ondary tele­photo cam­era, but I do not re­ally miss its ab­sence here. How­ever, a sec­ond, ul­tra-wide an­gle cam­era would have been use­ful.</p>
    <p>In my tests, I find it prac­ti­cally im­pos­si­ble to dis­tin­guish be­tween the pho­tos taken by the Pixel 4a and Pixel 4. Pho­tos have that dis­tinc­tive Pixel look where shad­ows are ac­cen­tu­ated.</p>
    <p>But the Pixel 4a lacks Pixel Neu­ral Core, the ded­i­cated chip in the Pixel 4 that helps with im­age pro­cess­ing and other ma­chine learn­ing tasks. Pho­tos shot by the Pixel 4a, es­pe­cially when us­ing Night Sight, gen­er­ally take a frac­tion longer to be saved than with the Pixel 4.</p>
    <p>In terms of soft­ware, the Pixel 4a has some new tricks, al­beit they are im­prove­ments to niche fea­tures, such as the Recorder au­dio record­ing app and the Live Cap­tion fea­ture that adds cap­tions to au­dio or video.</p>
    <p>The lat­ter now adds cap­tions to phone calls and video calls (with Google Duo or Face­book Mes­sen­ger, for in­stance), which is use­ful for hard-of-hear­ing users – de­spite the cap­tions not be­ing en­tirely ac­cu­rate in my test. Pre­sum­ably for places where there are laws on record­ing calls, a voice mes­sage in­forms the per­son on the other end about the live cap­tion be­ing used at the start of the call.</p>
    <p>With its mid-range Qual­comm Snap­dragon 730G chip, the Pixel 4a does take a sec­ond or two longer to open apps than the Pixel 4.</p>
    <p>The user in­ter­face is clean and re­spon­sive with­out un­nec­es­sary third-party or spon­sored apps. Of course, you may not find Google’s own pre-loaded apps, such as YouTube Mu­sic, your cup of tea.</p>
    <p>But per­haps you may change your mind af­ter try­ing the three months’ free trial of the YouTube Premium mu­sic and video ser­vice, Google One cloud stor­age and Google Play Pass apps and games sub­scrip­tion ser­vice, which are in­cluded with the Pixel 4a.</p>
    <p>The smaller 5.7-inch vari­ant of the Pixel 4 had a pal­try bat­tery (2,800mAh) that strug­gled to last a day of us­age.</p>
    <p>Thank­fully, Google did not make the same mis­take with the Pixel 4a, which packs a 3,140mAh bat­tery and man­aged 111/ hours in the</p>
    <p>2 video-loop bat­tery test.</p>
    <p>This is 21/ hours longer than the</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>Pixel 4, though last year’s Pixel 3a XL was still bet­ter (13 hours and 15 min­utes).</p>
