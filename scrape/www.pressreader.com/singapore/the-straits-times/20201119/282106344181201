    <p>The Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion (PSLE) re­sults will be re­leased next Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The Sec­ondary 1 (S1) op­tion forms to se­lect sec­ondary schools must be col­lected in per­son and will not be avail­able on­line, the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, school can­di­dates will col­lect their re­sults from their class­rooms in­stead of the school hall from 11am on­wards.</p>
    <p>This de­ci­sion was made to give pupils “the op­por­tu­nity to be with their class­mates and con­sult their teach­ers face to face on their next steps” when col­lect­ing their re­sults, said MOE.</p>
    <p>Due to the younger age of PSLE pupils, a par­ent or guardian will be al­lowed to ac­com­pany their child or ward to school to col­lect the re­sults. How­ever, they will need to wait at des­ig­nated ar­eas in school and ob­serve safe man­age­ment mea­sures while the pupils re­ceive their re­sults in the class­rooms.</p>
    <p>Pupils who are un­well or are on quar­an­tine or­der, stay-home no­tice or leave of ab­sence on the day of the re­sults re­lease should not re­turn to school to col­lect their re­sults.</p>
    <p>In­stead, they may view their re­sults on­line on the Sin­ga­pore Ex­am­i­na­tions and As­sess­ment Board’s (SEAB) re­sults re­lease sys­tem at www.seab.gov.sg from 11.30am next Wed­nes­day, with a pass­word that they have re­ceived from their schools.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem can be ac­cessed from next Wed­nes­day till Dec 8.</p>
    <p>School can­di­dates can also ap­point a proxy to col­lect a phys­i­cal copy of their re­sults on their be­half by Nov 27. Pupils who have not re­ceived their pass­words for SEAB’s re­sults re­lease sys­tem or are un­able to ap­point a proxy to col­lect their re­sults can con­tact their school for as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>SUB­MIS­SION OF SEC­ONDARY 1 OP­TIONS</p>
    <p>The S1 op­tion forms will be given to el­i­gi­ble pupils when they col­lect their re­sults slip in per­son, said MOE.</p>
    <p>Can­di­dates’ prox­ies can col­lect the S1 op­tion forms by Nov 27.</p>
    <p>Those who are un­able to re­ceive their forms can con­tact their school for as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>In every S1 op­tion form, there will be a unique S1 Per­sonal Iden­ti­fi­ca­tion Num­ber, which can be used to sub­mit sec­ondary school op­tions on­line and view the post­ing out­come on the Sec­ondary 1 In­ter­net Sys­tem (S1-IS).</p>
    <p>This por­tal will be ac­ces­si­ble from 11am next Wed­nes­day to 3pm on Dec 1 for pupils to sub­mit their school choices through the S1 post­ing web­site at www.moe.gov.sg/ s1-post­ing</p>
    <p>RE­LEASE OF SEC­ONDARY 1 POST­ING RE­SULTS</p>
    <p>The S1 post­ing re­sults will be re­leased on Dec 22 via SMS to a lo­cal num­ber pro­vided by the ap­pli­cant, via the S1-IS por­tal or at the pupil’s pri­mary school.</p>
    <p>Pupils do not need to re­port to their posted sec­ondary schools this year after re­ceiv­ing their S1 post­ing re­sults.</p>
    <p>In­stead, they should re­fer to their posted schools’ web­sites from Dec 22 for more in­for­ma­tion, such as in­struc­tions on on­line pur­chase of books and uni­forms, book list and re­port­ing de­tails.</p>
    <p>More de­tails can be found on the MOE web­site.</p>
