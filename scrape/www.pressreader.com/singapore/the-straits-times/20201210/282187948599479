    <p>One of the two maids al­legedly abused by their em­ployer’s wife in her Sen­tosa Cove home had to mas­sage the woman be­fore she slept, and was pur­port­edly pinched by her when she was un­happy with the mas­sage.</p>
    <p>Tan Lee Hoon, 56, is in court for five counts of vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing hurt to Ms Jene­fer Ve­gafria Aran­gote, 39, and an­other three charges in­volv­ing Ms Joan Lozares Lizardo, 33. Both are Filipino na­tion­als.</p>
    <p>Tan is rep­re­sented by lawyers Su­nil Sud­heesan and Diana Ngiam of Quahe Woo & Palmer LLC.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the sec­ond day of the trial, Ms Aran­gote told the court that she worked ir­reg­u­lar hours at Tan’s house.</p>
    <p>At times, she slept at 1pm or 2pm and woke up later at 5pm or 6pm be­fore work­ing through the night, the court heard.</p>
    <p>Part of her du­ties in­volved mas­sag­ing Tan be­fore the woman slept, which was also at ir­reg­u­lar tim­ings.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Mr Sud­heesan, Tan had mul­ti­ple med­i­cal con­di­tions and had dif­fi­culty sleep­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Aran­gote said that it was on two oc­ca­sions when she was giv­ing a mas­sage that Tan pinched her – twice in the arm in one in­stance and twice in the chest in an­other – which caused bruises.</p>
    <p>She said that Tan was un­happy with her mas­sage in those in­stances, but dis­agreed with Mr Sud­heesan’s sug­ges­tion that his client was demon­strat­ing mas­sage tech­niques which she mis­in­ter­preted as pinches.</p>
    <p>This was even as she agreed with Mr Sud­heesan that Tan had liked hard mas­sages and had shown the maids how to mas­sage her.</p>
    <p>She also re­called two other in­stances when Tan pinched her, in­clud­ing an in­ci­dent when she had ac­ci­den­tally knocked down a statue out­side the house.</p>
    <p>She took pho­tographs of her in­juries us­ing her mo­bile phone, and sent them to a friend and her boyfriend then.</p>
    <p>Ms Aran­gote, who was hazy on the dates of all the in­ci­dents she tes­ti­fied to in court, said that her mo­bile phone was con­fis­cated by Tan af­ter the lat­ter had an­other maid, known as Emily, sent home.</p>
    <p>The court also heard that she wit­nessed Tan abus­ing Ms Lizardo in three in­stances.</p>
    <p>Tan had hit Ms Lizardo on the head while the lat­ter was help­ing her put on her socks and later kicked the maid in the chest when wear­ing her shoes, said Ms Aran­gote.</p>
    <p>Tan also struck Ms Lizardo with a stick while both maids were in the kitchen, she added.</p>
    <p>Tan’s trial is ex­pected to re­sume to­day.</p>
    <p>If found guilty, she can be jailed for up to three years, or fined up to $7,500, or both for each of­fence.</p>
    <p>Tan’s hus­band Sim Guan Huat is ac­cused of em­ploy­ing Ms Lizardo with­out a valid work pass from Oct 23, 2015 to Dec 1, 2016, among other charges.</p>
    <p>His case is also ex­pected to be heard in court to­day.</p>
