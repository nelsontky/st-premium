    <p>Ce­cil Rhodes, the late Bri­tish im­pe­ri­al­ist who founded the colonies of South­ern and North­ern Rhode­sia – now known as Zam­bia and Zim­babwe – once said to a com­pa­triot: “Re­mem­ber that you are an English­man, and have con­se­quently won first prize in the lottery of life.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ed­ward Booty, how­ever, begs to dif­fer. In fact, he finds re­pug­nant the idea that he has some priv­i­lege just be­cause he was born a tall, white male in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>“I feel un­nec­es­sar­ily en­ti­tled due to where I was born, that it au­to­mat­i­cally en­ti­tles me to health­care ac­cess,” says the 32-year-old.</p>
    <p>“The fact that 3.7 bil­lion weren’t born like me is fun­da­men­tally a so­cial in­jus­tice that I do not be­lieve in,” he says, re­fer­ring to the num­ber of peo­ple on the planet who do not have ac­cess to health­care.</p>
    <p>It per­haps ex­plains why he is in this neck of the woods, chan­nelling his en­er­gies into help­ing poor and iso­lated com­mu­ni­ties in coun­tries such as In­dia, the Philip­pines and Cam­bo­dia.</p>
    <p>Mr Booty is the f ounder of reach52, a Sin­ga­pore-based so­cial en­ter­prise that uses dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy, com­mu­nity em­pow­er­ment and in­no­va­tive pub­lic-pri­vate part­ner­ships to de­liver af­ford­able health­care to ar­eas where ac­cess is low or non-ex­is­tent.</p>
    <p>It lever­ages dig­i­tal plat­forms and ap­points a cou­ple of women in these com­mu­ni­ties to “col­lect data on health­care needs, or­gan­ise health events, or­der medicine as well as of­fer in­surance plans”.</p>
    <p>A se­ri­ous and driven man, Mr Booty is the el­dest of five chil­dren of civil-ser­vant par­ents. He stud­ied hu­man re­source man­age­ment and em­ploy­ment re­la­tions at the Lon­don School of Eco­nom­ics and em­barked on a life-chang­ing trip to In­dia af­ter grad­u­at­ing in 2010.</p>
    <p>Ex­posed to poverty, his per­spec­tives on life changed, es­pe­cially af­ter he nabbed an in­tern­ship in the coun­try and spent nearly eight months work­ing for a phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany which was try­ing to un­lock large pock­ets of ru­ral cus­tomer bases by of­fer­ing dis­counted medicine.</p>
    <p>He fell in love with the idea of do­ing so­cial good through in­no­va­tive busi­ness mod­els.</p>
    <p>Upon re­turn­ing to Bri­tain, he worked in a con­sul­tancy and, later, the Na­tional Health Ser­vice, fo­cus­ing on dig­i­tal and op­er­a­tional im­prove­ment.</p>
    <p>But he soon grew tired of the bu­reau­cracy and pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>“A lot of in­no­va­tion is blocked be­cause of pol­i­tics,” says Mr Booty, who was also turned off by how his coun­try­men take for granted the free univer­sal health cov­er­age they get.</p>
    <p>He de­cided to throw him­self a gaunt­let: “Can I go to ar­eas with no health­care and work with gov­ern­ments to build dig­i­tal and pri­mary health­care sup­port?”</p>
    <p>And that is how he ended up in Sin­ga­pore in 2015. reach52 – the num­ber refers to the per­cent­age of peo­ple on the planet with no health­care ac­cess – was born the fol­low­ing year.</p>
    <p>The ini­tial go­ing was rough. He went it alone with his sav­ings and credit cards, and it took end­less e-mail mes­sages, lots of per­se­ver­ance and con­stant net­work­ing be­fore the en­ter­prise took off.</p>
    <p>To­day, reach52 works not j ust with phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies, but also gov­ern­ment agen­cies, non­govern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions (NGOs) as well as in­surance com­pa­nies to pro­vide un­der­served com­mu­ni­ties ac­cess to af­ford­able prod­ucts and ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Along the way, it has found sup­port­ers. For in­stance, it re­ceived a DBS Foun­da­tion grant last year.</p>
    <p>“The DBS Foun­da­tion wanted to chal­lenge us to grow faster so we took all of the fund­ing they gave us and we launched in In­dia re­cently,” Mr Booty says.</p>
    <p>“We’ve opened an of­fice in Ban­ga­lore and wanted to work with three on-the-ground NGOs to launch this ser­vice to col­lect data, con­nect pa­tients to gov­ern­ment and NGO health­care as well as of­fer our dis­counted or af­ford­able in­surance and medicine prod­ucts.”</p>
    <p>From a small out­fit, reach52 now hires about 45 peo­ple across five of­fices in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Asked what he is proud­est of, he says: “I guess it’s start­ing some­thing from noth­ing. Be­ing a solo founder is pretty tough, but to look back and see our 50 or so strong team in the of­fice and 400 peo­ple we have hired in the com­mu­nity is great.</p>
    <p>“It feels only 1 per cent com­plete, but still, it is nice to re­flect that this all started with me sit­ting in my bed­room with Pow­erPoint, trawl­ing LinkedIn to find po­ten­tial part­ners, and an idea.”</p>
    <p>If you had not gone on that trip to In­dia all those years ago, do you reckon you will be do­ing what you are do­ing?</p>
    <p>I think yes. Ul­ti­mately, even from when I started reach52, the model and my mind­set have changed and evolved quite sig­nif­i­cantly. There can be many paths to get to the same out­come or end point.</p>
    <p>Other fac­tors – events, ex­pe­ri­ences or even just read­ing cer­tain books – have shaped my think­ing over the past decade. I think quite dif­fer­ently from when I left In­dia.</p>
    <p>Is it true that one of your rea­sons for quit­ting a well-paid job to start reach52 was you did not care about money?</p>
    <p>I have quite mixed views about money. Ul­ti­mately, it’s an ethe­real so­cial con­struct that has no ab­so­lute value, just the value so­ci­ety as­cribes it. I re­mem­ber in my early jobs just long­ing for that de­cent pay hike, but as soon as I got it, I just wanted more and felt en­ti­tled to a higher salary.</p>
    <p>I then quite sud­denly got a pretty huge pro­mo­tion and more than dou­bled my salary un­ex­pect­edly, but even then, still felt I should get more.</p>
    <p>It felt like a nev­erend­ing thirst that couldn’t be sat­is­fied and thus I just wanted to be com­fort­able and do things I en­joyed and cared about.</p>
    <p>You could have started a so­cial en­ter­prise or do good in Lon­don. Why health­care and why in Asia?</p>
    <p>First, I don’t like to think about im­pact in terms of look­ing af­ter one’s own coun­try or race. Trans­fixed na­tion­al­ism sucks as we are see­ing i n var­i­ous forms now. I haven’t felt es­pe­cially “Bri­tish” or like I should just do some­thing good for Bri­tish peo­ple for quite some time.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, we are all hu­man and in the grand scheme of things, Bri­tain is one of the largest economies glob­ally, with gov­ern­ment-funded health­care for all and a pretty com­pre­hen­sive so­cial se­cu­rity net.</p>
    <p>A lot of Bri­tish peo­ple don’t value or re­alise that. So I didn’t want to spend my time mak­ing a good sys­tem even bet­ter – it’s not as chal­leng­ing, re­ward­ing or nec­es­sary – and I pre­fer to do some­thing for some­one who re­ally needs it.</p>
    <p>Health­care is an es­sen­tial hu­man right, but it doesn’t reach 52 per cent of our planet and that’s just a moral and so­cial in­jus­tice.</p>
    <p>Asia felt like a good place to me, given the dig­i­tal boom, low-mid­dle in­come fo­cus, the diver­sity of the coun­tries we could trial our model in and high out-of-pocket health costs.</p>
    <p>Did you come close to giv­ing up? If so, what or who made you stay the course?</p>
    <p>Not even close. Frankly, I en­joy the tough times the most. It helps you find out who you are deeply.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­thing from Covid-19 pres­sures to run­ning out of money and mak­ing sure the team got paid through maxing out five credit cards, to los­ing our big­gest con­tract at the fi­nal stage and sleep­less nights, as well as in­sanely long hours and hack­ing at­tempts on our apps. It’s all tough stuff, but it’s what helps me fo­cus and push harder.</p>
    <p>The poet W.B. Yeats once wrote: “In dreams be­gin re­spon­si­bil­i­ties”. Is reach52 a big re­spon­si­bil­ity?</p>
    <p>The main re­spon­si­bil­ity I feel is to many of our team mem­bers and part­ners – they backed me. Many took big pay cuts to do so or took a gam­ble in their or­gan­i­sa­tions to try some­thing new. Mak­ing sure I do right by the peo­ple who sup­ported me, in­clud­ing our busi­ness part­ners, has al­ways been a big pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>I’ve sort of had this logic that if I work for my team and then they work for me and our goals, we achieve our so­cial-im­pact mis­sion and de­liver health for all. Ul­ti­mately, this is a tough space and we all have to push for­ward to­gether.</p>
    <p>What does pur­pose mean to you?</p>
    <p>“Why does what I do mat­ter?” is a ques­tion I try to ask my­self most weeks and I base quite a lot of my life de­ci­sions on the con­cept of “mat­ter”.</p>
    <p>On one hand, it’s your pur­pose. On the other, it’s the atoms and quarks that you’re made up from a molec­u­lar level. And also the im­por­tance of some­thing and the ma­te­ri­al­ity of an is­sue. I like to think about all three to­gether.</p>
    <p>At a phys­i­cal level, we have to ap­pre­ci­ate the tem­po­rary con­scious­ness our phys­i­cal form has and be at peace with our bi­o­log­i­cal clock that’s ticking and just be grate­ful for ev­ery­thing around us.</p>
    <p>I try not to as­cribe too much value to things that don’t have real im­por­tance in life and I’d say my life motto is “ra­tio­nalise and move on”, which has helped me get through some rel­a­tively tough times and also keep mo­ti­vated when there’s a set­back in work or per­sonal life.</p>
    <p>I feel that if you can spend your con­scious time do­ing some­thing that is for the bet­ter­ment of those around you, fo­cus­ing on ma­te­rial is­sues that fun­da­men­tally af­fect the phys­i­cal and so­cial be­ing of our species, it’s a good and pur­pose­ful thing.</p>
    <p>St John’s Is­land</p>
    <p>The waters here are cool, invit­ing and a deep aqua­ma­rine. Feel­ing the wind in my hair and the crunch of sand at my feet, I won­der why I don’t come here more of­ten.</p>
    <p>It’s been only an hour since I ar­rived on a ferry from the main­land, but I al­ready feel hap­pier and saner – so im­por­tant in these stress­ful times.</p>
    <p>It is early Oc­to­ber and the mood on St John’s is al­most fes­tive – a far cry from its his­tory as a place of quar­an­tine and po­lit­i­cal de­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>There is much flora and fauna to dis­cover if you have the pa­tience (and luck) – ma­rine crea­tures in the in­ter­tidal zone, as well as birds such as the brah­miny kite and great­billed heron.</p>
    <p>Mind­less rest and re­lax­ation, how­ever, seems to be the main thing on peo­ple’s minds. And who can blame them?</p>
    <p>Some toss fris­bees, while oth­ers wade in the wa­ter or sit at pic­nic ta­bles with packed lunches. Young brawny scuba divers stand on the jetty like ex­tras in a Mamma Mia! mu­si­cal.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery so of­ten, new ar­rivals stream in with bags of beer, chips, and cold boxes. Some­one plays the ukulele.</p>
