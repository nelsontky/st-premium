    <p>A $38 mil­lion cam­pus bring­ing to­gether all of air­plane maker Air­bus’ op­er­a­tions in Sin­ga­pore was of­fi­cially opened in Sele­tar yes­ter­day. This makes the 51,000 sq m fa­cil­ity a state­ment of con­fi­dence in Sin­ga­pore, said Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing. Air­bus em­ploys around 800 peo­ple here.</p>
    <p>A $38 mil­lion cam­pus bring­ing to­gether all of air­plane maker Air­bus’ op­er­a­tions in Sin­ga­pore was of­fi­cially opened in Sele­tar yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The open­ing was ini­tially sched­uled nearly nine months ago but was de­layed by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The con­sol­i­da­tion comes in the midst of the dev­as­tat­ing im­pact of Covid-19 on the global avi­a­tion and aerospace in­dus­try. An­cil­lary ser­vices such as the main­te­nance and pro­duc­tion of air­craft have suf­fered a 40 per cent hit when com­pared with last year, while pas­sen­ger num­bers have plunged by 66 per cent.</p>
    <p>This makes the 51,000 sq m fa­cil­ity – oc­cu­py­ing an area slightly more than seven foot­ball fields – a state­ment of con­fi­dence in Sin­ga­pore, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said at its in­au­gu­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>“Prior to Covid-19, most of us would have looked at this event as just an­other oc­ca­sion where some­one from the avi­a­tion in­dus­try makes an in­vest­ment in Sin­ga­pore. What is sig­nif­i­cant about today is that this is a time when very few</p>
    <p>peo­ple in the world are ac­tu­ally think­ing about grow­ing the avi­a­tion in­dus­try,” he said.</p>
    <p>New fa­cil­i­ties on the cam­pus in­clude a three-storey of­fice build­ing that serves as the com­pany’s re­gional hub for Air­bus’ com­mer­cial air­craft, de­fence, space and heli­copter busi­nesses in the re­gion, as well as a sec­ond ware­house that will in­crease the com­pany’s stor­age ca­pac­ity by over 70 per cent.</p>
    <p>There will also be a branch of Air­bus’ global lead­er­ship univer­sity, which pro­vides train­ing for its em­ploy­ees, the sec­ond one in Asia af­ter Bei­jing, and a fa­cil­ity from which a new re­gional op­er­a­tion for Sky­wise, the com­pany’s dig­i­tal ser­vice plat­form, can be launched.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean gi­ant em­ploys</p>
    <p>around 800 peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore and more than 130,000 world­wide, and al­ready has a train­ing cen­tre and spare parts dis­tri­bu­tion fa­cil­ity at the site in Sele­tar.</p>
    <p>Air­bus chief com­mer­cial of­fi­cer and head of in­ter­na­tional Chris­tian Scherer, in his speech at the in­au­gu­ra­tion, noted that avi­a­tion has con­tin­ued to sup­port 47 mil­lion jobs, or 2.5 per cent of all em­ploy­ment, in the re­gion, and urged Sin­ga­pore to con­tinue to take the lead in gen­er­at­ing pro­to­cols that would al­low planes to take to the skies.</p>
    <p>He added: “When the fly­ing re­sumes, we think that by po­si­tion­ing our­selves here in Sin­ga­pore, we will be able to re-es­tab­lish phys­i­cal con­tact with our part­ners and cus­tomers and move to the next</p>
    <p>phase of re­cov­ery.”</p>
    <p>Air­bus has been in Sin­ga­pore for about 50 years, be­gin­ning in 1969 with the sale of the first four he­li­copters to the Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Air Force.</p>
    <p>Since then, it has worked closely with com­pa­nies in the aerospace in­dus­try on the is­land, jointly in­vest­ing with Sin­ga­pore Air­lines to train pi­lots and work­ing with A*Star on aerospace re­search.</p>
    <p>The Air­bus Asia Train­ing Cen­tre, a joint ven­ture be­tween Air­bus and Sin­ga­pore Air­lines which opened in 2016, is now Air­bus’ largest flight crew train­ing fa­cil­ity in its global network, with more than 60 air­lines us­ing it.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said the open­ing of the cam­pus “in the depth of cri­sis” as</p>
    <p>sures him that not much can stop Sin­ga­pore and Air­bus’ part­ner­ship in the next 50 years.</p>
    <p>He spoke of op­por­tu­ni­ties emerg­ing in sev­eral ar­eas, in­clud­ing in sus­tain­abil­ity for the avi­a­tion in­dus­try to achieve car­bon-neu­tral growth and fu­ture modes of trans­porta­tion such as drones that could im­prove the safety of flights.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic led Air­bus to cut about 15,000 jobs world­wide ear­lier this year, although it did not re­veal to what ex­tent em­ploy­ees in Sin­ga­pore would be af­fected. The Straits Times un­der­stands that Air­bus has no plans to in­crease the num­ber of em­ploy­ees here in the com­ing months.</p>
