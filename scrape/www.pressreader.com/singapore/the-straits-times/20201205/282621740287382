    <p>Two ath­letes were with­drawn from a sports event in Sin­ga­pore ow­ing to Covid-19 safety pro­to­cols for the first time yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This took place just hours be­fore Ukrainian world cham­pion Ro­man Kryk­lia was to take on Dutch-Turk­ish kick-boxer Mu­rat Ay­gun in their light heavy­weight ti­tle bout at One Cham­pi­onship’s Big Bang event.</p>
    <p>The fight had been ear­marked as the main event at the Sin­ga­pore In­door Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>It was re­placed by the feath­er­weight kick-box­ing fight be­tween Ar­me­nian-Bel­gian Marat Grigo­rian and Rus­sian Ivan Kon­dratev, although Ay­gun re­mained on the card to face An­der­son Silva in a light heavy­weight kick-box­ing match.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme was also dis­rupted when Greco-Ro­man wrestling world cham­pion Amir Ali­ak­bari of Iran failed to make his One Cham­pi­onship de­but af­ter he pulled out of his heavy­weight bout against Rus­sian Ab­dul­basir Vagabov for sim­i­lar rea­sons.</p>
    <p>An atomweight bout be­tween Ji­hin Radzuan and Bi Nguyen, and a feath­er­weight kick­box­ing clash be­tween Andy Souwer and Zhang Chunyu were added to the card.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, One said: “Kryk­lia tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19. How­ever, he is un­der quar­an­tine af­ter com­ing into close con­tact with an in­di­vid­ual who tested pos­i­tive on Nov 27.”</p>
    <p>That in­di­vid­ual is be­lieved to be Kryk­lia’s cor­ner­man.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, One and the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) had re­vealed that a cor­ner­man had pro­duced a pos­i­tive re­sult upon ar­rival here on Nov 27. He was sent to a hospi­tal and is un­der­go­ing treat­ment.</p>
    <p>In com­bat sport, cor­ner­men can be train­ers, coaches, cut­men, or train­ing part­ners, and of­ten spend a lot of time in close prox­im­ity to their fighter.</p>
    <p>One added that both Kryk­lia and Ali­ak­bari had tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 be­fore fly­ing into Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>It added that while Ali­ak­bari tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 be­fore his fight, sero­log­i­cal tests showed that this was due to a past in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>He has been dis­charged from hospi­tal but did not par­tic­i­pate in last night’s event as a pre­cau­tion.</p>
    <p>“Pub­lic health and safety re­main our top pri­or­ity,” said One and STB. “This case was de­tected through the screen­ing pro­to­cols and strin­gent mea­sures that were put in place to safe­guard the health of our local com­mu­nity as well as the ath­letes and pro­duc­tion crew.”</p>
    <p>Big Bang is One’s third show in Sin­ga­pore since the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. It held a closed-door event on Oct 9 and an­other on Oct 30, which was the first live sports event here to wel­come spec­ta­tors.</p>
    <p>Then, two pos­i­tive cases were de­tected ahead of its In­side The Ma­trix event but both were cor­ner­men, not ath­letes. They were de­ter­mined to be past in­fec­tions af­ter sero­log­i­cal tests and had re­cov­ered. They were kept out of the event as a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure but the pro­gramme was not dis­rupted.</p>
    <p>One’s events are part of a pi­lot project the Gov­ern­ment hopes will help iden­tify a model that can be widely im­ple­mented so that more large-scale events can re­sume safely in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Strin­gent pro­to­cols have been adopted and in­clude the re­quire­ment for all for­eign-based ath­letes, cor­ner­men and staff to be iso­lated un­til they re­ceive a neg­a­tive test re­sult, af­ter which they will fol­low a strictly con­trolled itin­er­ary that has been pre-ap­proved.</p>
    <p>Like the Oct 30 event, Big Bang had up to 250 paid spec­ta­tors and they had to un­dergo anti­gen rapid tests ear­lier in the day.</p>
    <p>Kryk­lia tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19. How­ever, he is un­der quar­an­tine af­ter com­ing into close con­tact with an in­di­vid­ual who tested pos­i­tive on Nov 27.</p>
