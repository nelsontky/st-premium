    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19) Clar­ity is key – do not rush through con­ver­sa­tions and leave folks with unan­swered ques­tions. Slow down when speak­ing or writ­ing.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20) Take an­other look at your business deal­ings – they may not be all you hope for. You may not have to leave, but know what you are deal­ing with.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20) You are happy – al­most giddy – and may end up flirt­ing with some­one you barely know. Go for it un­less you think you may hurt some­one.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22) De­tails are im­por­tant. It is tempt­ing to think broadly or more long-term, but it will be more re­ward­ing to fo­cus on the nitty-gritty.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22) You may find you have more in­for­ma­tion than you need or that all op­tions seem equally ter­rific. Make up your mind to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22) Work is­sues pop up, even if you do not have a job. It could be a call from an old boss, a rush project or some­thing equally ex­cit­ing.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22) Your big brain is fully en­gaged. Use this ter­rific en­ergy to show the world what you are ca­pa­ble of. Great things are pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21) The tini­est de­tails are prob­lem­atic – so re­view ev­ery row in that spread­sheet or check your maths when­ever you add or sub­tract.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21) Fo­cus on the right is­sue. Take the lead, be­cause your en­ergy is right for mak­ing key de­ci­sions and show­ing oth­ers how to suc­ceed.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19) You are less fo­cused than usual, but that could mean folks are dis­tract­ing you from what is im­por­tant. Get some alone time.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18) A wave of cre­ative en­ergy sweeps you up. Just let it go on its own and you should be pleased with the re­sults you get nat­u­rally.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20) You are of two minds about some­thing im­por­tant. See if you can re­solve your con­fu­sion by seek­ing more in­for­ma­tion and ad­vice.</p>
