    <p>Com­pa­nies and an­a­lysts wel­comed the ex­ten­sion of the Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS) to cush­ion the heavy im­pact of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, but added that it may not be enough on its own to save some firms, such as those in tourism.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy Se­lena Ling said: “Seven more months is quite gen­er­ous and will help tide (over) dis­tressed com­pa­nies dur­ing these chal­leng­ing times. Hope­fully, by March 2021, there may be greater clar­ity that things are turn­ing around.”</p>
    <p>She added that the ta­per­ing off is rather re­strained as the sup­port could have been cut by half or even not ex­tended at all for some in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>CIMB Pri­vate Bank­ing econ­o­mist Song Seng Wun noted that the scheme has been cal­i­brated such that ev­ery busi­ness gets help, even those at the third tier.</p>
    <p>“The tiered ap­proach is prac­ti­cal as not all busi­nesses can get back on their feet to the same de­gree. Even the 10 per cent sup­port can help, such as to pay the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund con­tri­bu­tion of staff. From an ag­gre­gate stand­point, it is about sav­ing as many jobs as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>Mr Samir Bedi, EY Asean work­force ad­vi­sory leader, said the scheme helps to both save and cre­ate jobs. “One of the rea­sons this is im­por­tant is that by sav­ing these jobs, we can re­tain core ca­pa­bil­i­ties and skills in those (hard-hit) sec­tors, so even­tu­ally when busi­nesses start re­cov­er­ing, we are able to re­tain our work­ers to be able to scale our ef­forts... The 10 per cent help for those that still have a pos­i­tive out­look also cre­ates an im­pe­tus for job cre­ation and op­por­tu­ni­ties for... shift­ing the work­force to those sec­tors.”</p>
    <p>But while the JSS will help, firms are still not out of the woods.</p>
    <p>Ms Ling said: “The JSS has likely helped to head off the worst of the lo­cal re­trench­ments... but it is still an evolv­ing story. If de­mand con­di­tions don’t pick up soon, some firms may still go un­der and the re­cal­i­brated JSS will only buy a bit more time.”</p>
    <p>Mr Song said: “It re­ally is to cush­ion the im­pact, which was re­flected in the un­em­ploy­ment rate be­ing not as bad as ex­pected. But the rate will still rise, as vul­ner­a­ble in­dus­tries like aero­space face sig­nif­i­cant head­winds.”</p>
    <p>He added that com­pa­nies cater­ing mainly to tourists and those in arts and en­ter­tain­ment may also still suf­fer.</p>
    <p>Re­cruit­ment firm EPS Con­sul­tants, which has 39 lo­cals among its 42 work­ers, said the JSS de­frayed the cost of re­tain­ing lo­cal staff. It falls un­der the third tier that will get 10 per cent sup­port.</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor Kitty Tan said: “Our com­pany con­tin­ues to face cost pres­sure due to falling rev­enue. The 10 per cent may not be suf­fi­cient, but we will find ways to fur­ther re­duce our busi­ness costs from other ar­eas and de­vise ways to trans­form our busi­ness model.”</p>
    <p>Smart san­i­tary so­lu­tions com­pany Rigel said the JSS has helped the firm re­tain core tal­ents and fo­cus its ef­forts on fu­ture devel­op­ment plans. It has about 100 work­ers here.</p>
    <p>The firm, which falls un­der the first tier, is also look­ing to ex­pand into new mar­kets and grow busi­ness rev­enue.</p>
    <p>Ms Car­rie Tan, its group di­rec­tor of cor­po­rate devel­op­ment and hu­man re­sources, said: “We hope the con­struc­tion sec­tor can pick up in time, in or­der for busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties to re­sume... How­ever, if con­struc­tion ac­tiv­i­ties con­tinue to be halted for a long pe­riod, then the sup­port may not be ad­e­quate for the in­dus­try. None­the­less, we are thank­ful for the ex­tended wage sup­port from Septem­ber, which will be a great re­lief as the sec­tor re­cov­ers.”</p>
    <p>Korean eatery Seoul Gar­den said the JSS has helped it to re-al­lo­cate its re­sources to ar­eas such as job re­design, train­ing, tech­nol­ogy and in­no­va­tion, hence cre­at­ing new jobs and roles. The firm, which is in the sec­ond tier, has 200 work­ers.</p>
    <p>Group gen­eral man­ager Garry Lam said: “Seek­ing new op­por­tu­ni­ties in the new nor­mal through max­imis­ing the re­sources to up­skill our peo­ple should be the fo­cus, which is fur­ther en­hanced and sup­ported by the ex­ten­sion of JSS.”</p>
