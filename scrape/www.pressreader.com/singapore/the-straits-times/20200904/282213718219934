    <p>Ri­val Amer­i­can Airlines last week said it would lay off 19,000 work­ers with­out fed­eral aid. In­clud­ing vol­un­tary de­par­tures or leave, its 140,000 pre-pan­demic work­force will shrink by 30 per cent. Delta Air Lines plans to lay off nearly 2,000 pi­lots but has not yet num­bered po­ten­tial cuts for its other work­ers.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>United Airlines said on Wed­nes­day that it is pre­par­ing to fur­lough 16,370 work­ers when fed­eral aid ex­pires on Oct 1 as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic con­tin­ues to dev­as­tate the air­line in­dus­try, though one union said many more peo­ple will be with­out pay.</p>
    <p>United’s cuts in­clude 6,920 flight at­ten­dants, but the union rep­re­sent­ing them said that 14,000 will not have a pay cheque next month un­less Congress acts to ex­tend US$25 bil­lion (S$34 bil­lion) in aid.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause many have opted for leave that will pro­vide health­care but no money, As­so­ci­a­tion of Flight At­ten­dants-CWA in­ter­na­tional pres­i­dent Sara Nel­son said.</p>
    <p>“United’s fur­lough an­nounce­ment does not tell the full story.”</p>
    <p>Airlines have been lob­by­ing Washington for a sec­ond stim­u­lus pack­age to pro­tect j obs through next March while the i ndus­try awaits a re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>The first US$25 bil­lion, which cov­ered air­line pay­rolls, ex­pires this month, but talks have stalled as Congress has strug­gled to reach an agree­ment on a broader coro­n­avirus as­sis­tance pack­age.</p>
    <p>United had more than 90,000 em­ploy­ees be­fore the pan­demic brought the i ndus­try to a near stand­still in March.</p>
    <p>It warned in July that 36,000 jobs were at risk of in­vol­un­tary fur­loughs as de­mand re­mained weak.</p>
    <p>US pas­sen­ger airlines are still col­lec­tively los­ing more than US$5 bil­lion a month as 30 per cent of planes re­main parked.</p>
    <p>Pas­sen­ger travel de­mand is down about 70 per cent and, on av­er­age, planes that are fly­ing are half-full.</p>
    <p>Some 7,400 United em­ploy­ees have opted to take early re­tire­ment or de­par­ture pack­ages, and the com­pany is work­ing through sev­eral other vol­un­tary tem­po­rary leave pro­grammes to fur­ther re­duce the num­ber of fur­loughs, United of­fi­cials said, with­out pro­vid­ing spe­cific num­bers.</p>
    <p>The leave would give the com­pany flex­i­bil­ity to call back staff once travel re­turns, they said.</p>
    <p>United’s fur­loughs will also af­fect around 2,850 pi­lots, 2,010 me­chan­ics and 1,400 man­age­ment and ad­min­is­tra­tive po­si­tions, among oth­ers, though ne­go­ti­a­tions con­tinue with pi­lots to re­duce the fi­nal num­ber.</p>

    <p>Delta Air Lines plans to lay off nearly 2,000 pi­lots but has not yet num­bered po­ten­tial cuts for its other work­ers.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has said his ad­min­is­tra­tion would help US airlines but has not given any de­tails.</p>
    <p>Congress also ap­proved an­other US$25 bil­lion in loans for airlines un­der the first stim­u­lus pack­age, but not all of them are tap­ping the fund.</p>
