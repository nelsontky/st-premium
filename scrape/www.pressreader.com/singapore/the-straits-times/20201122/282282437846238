    <p>WHERE 2 Yishun Walk</p>
    <p>AD­MIS­SION Starts at $10 a ses­sion dur­ing off-peak hours for chil­dren with HomeTeamNS Fam­ily Mem­ber­ship;</p>
    <p>$14 for kids who are T-play mem­bers; $20 for non-T-Play mem­bers, which in­cludes all other kids and adults; free for each kid be­low 12 months who en­ters with a pay­ing child</p>
    <p>INFO www.hometeamns.sg/ tplay/khatib</p>
    <p>THE LOW­DOWN</p>
    <p>The new HomeTeamNS</p>
    <p>Club­house in Khatib in­cludes T-Play, an in­door play­ground for chil­dren un­der 12. It is the first to have a Per­anakan-in­flu­enced de­sign theme and in­cor­po­rates the clas­sic Toa Payoh dragon-shaped play­ground de­sign in a climb­ing slide tower.</p>
    <p>FUN FAC­TOR</p>
    <p>My fam­ily has been to many in­door play­grounds in Sin­ga­pore and can at­test that this one stands out for its lo­cal de­sign theme. This scores in terms of nos­tal­gia as my wife and I have fond mem­o­ries of the dragon play­grounds.</p>
    <p>Our tod­dler keeps busy in the ball pit, which in­cludes toy ve­hi­cles that can be taken apart and put to­gether again. There is a lot more for the seven-year-old to do, from the ninja ob­sta­cle course and tram­po­lines to the many slides and a mini fut­sal court.</p>
    <p>LEARN­ING VALUE</p>
    <p>With so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, there is a limit to the num­ber of kids al­lowed in each play area. It is a chance for my kids to learn pa­tience as they wait their turn and also to be con­sid­er­ate by not hog­ging the play items.</p>
    <p>As in any play­ground, chil­dren also pick up so­cial skills in­ter­act­ing with other kids.</p>
    <p>There are also ob­vi­ous health ben­e­fits to ac­tive phys­i­cal play.</p>
    <p>ROOM FOR IM­PROVE­MENT</p>
    <p>At 650 sq m, this is cer­tainly not the big­gest in­door play­ground in Sin­ga­pore. Just as well that each ses­sion is lim­ited to two hours – more than enough time for my daugh­ters to go through ev­ery­thing sev­eral times over.</p>
    <p>INSIDER TIP</p>
    <p>Make sure the kids wear socks, prefer­ably rub­ber-soled ones that pro­vide a good grip for climb­ing.</p>
    <p>There are sev­eral restau­rants in the same build­ing so you can plan for a meal af­ter all that play.</p>
    <p>WILL WE BE BACK?</p>
    <p>Yes, but only be­cause there are other ac­tiv­i­ties for par­ents at the HomeTeamNS Club­house while the kids are oc­cu­pied. For starters, I would love a go at the four-storey ob­sta­cle course at the In­door Ad­ven­ture Hub.</p>
