    <p>Due to her ad­vanced stage of de­men­tia, Madam Joyce Liew can no longer form proper sen­tences.</p>
    <p>But her hus­band, Dr Colin Chong, has learnt to in­ter­pret her ut­ter­ances be­yond “yes” and “no”.</p>
    <p>“I know the sounds she makes that in­di­cate her anx­i­ety or dis­com­fort, and those that ex­press hap­pi­ness,” says the 71-year-old, who runs a health­care busi­ness and is the sole care­giver.</p>
    <p>Madam Liew, 69, who was di­ag­nosed with de­men­tia 12 years ago, had a fall at home and was hos­pi­talised for 12 days in April af­ter surgery for a frac­tured hip.</p>
    <p>Dr Chong quickly es­tab­lished a new rou­tine at home af­ter her dis­charge to man­age her re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>With the launch of a free hand­book called Hack Care by Sin­ga­pore­based phil­an­thropic or­gan­i­sa­tion, the Lien Foun­da­tion, he now has bet­ter ideas to fur­ther im­prove Madam Liew’s home rou­tine.</p>
    <p>He in­tends to use the “de­sign hacks” in the 240-page book which in­clude im­pro­vis­ing fur­ni­ture and cre­at­ing cosy spa­ces to al­low per­sons with de­men­tia to age in place and be sur­rounded by fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Alzheimer’s Disease As­so­ci­a­tion (ADA), de­men­tia is an um­brella term used to de­scribe symp­toms of im­pair­ment in mem­ory, com­mu­ni­ca­tion and think­ing.</p>
    <p>The foun­da­tion com­mis­sioned Lekker Ar­chi­tects to cre­ate the hand­book. Launched on Sun­day, it is styled to look like Swedish fur­ni­ture re­tailer Ikea’s prod­uct cat­a­logue.</p>
    <p>Ikea is not in­volved in the cre­ation of the hand­book.</p>
    <p>Ms Corinna Schuler, head of cor­po­rate com­mu­ni­ca­tion for Ikea South-east Asia, says: “Safety is also a top pri­or­ity for Ikea and the hacks pre­sented in this play­ful take of our cat­a­logue are not tested by us, but we did en­joy look­ing at the ideas.”</p>
    <p>She adds: “The Lien Foun­da­tion is work­ing to make ev­ery­day life a lit­tle bet­ter for vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple, and in this en­deav­our, we wish the foun­da­tion and its col­lab­o­ra­tors all the very best.”</p>
    <p>Hack Care is de­signed to en­cour­age a do-it-your­self ap­proach to care­giv­ing. Be­sides the cat­a­logue, there is also a ded­i­cated web­site (hack­care.sg) for fur­ther de­tailed in­struc­tions and on­line man­u­als.</p>
    <p>Dr Chong says “most of the items in Hack Care will help my wife re­cu­per­ate faster”, adding that Madam Liew’s great­est fear now is to have an­other fall and un­dergo an “ag­o­nis­ing hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion”.</p>
    <p>He finds the book of tips use­ful in re­plac­ing and cus­tomis­ing fur­ni­ture to suit Madam Liew’s needs at home. Her re­cov­ery is ex­pected to take be­tween six months and a year.</p>
    <p>“Of all the hacks, I like the idea of adapt­ing the Poang Chair best,” says Dr Chong, re­fer­ring to Ikea’s clas­sic arm­chair.</p>
    <p>In the hand­book, the seat is turned into a stur­dier ver­sion with ex­tra arm­rests and a head­rest which Dr Chong thinks could help his wife rest bet­ter.</p>
    <p>The hand­book also fea­tures ad­vice from health­care pro­fes­sion­als such as Dr Wong Chek Hooi, se­nior con­sul­tant at the depart­ment of geri­atric medicine at Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal; Ms Ruth Wong, pro­gramme lead at ADA; and Mr Eric Lim, a psy­chol­o­gist at the Brahm Cen­tre, a char­ity of­fer­ing health ed­u­ca­tion and men­tal sup­port.</p>
    <p>In 2013, the In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health led a study called Well-Be­ing Of The Sin­ga­pore El­derly and found that one in 10 Sin­ga­pore­ans aged 60 years and above had de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to ADA, the num­ber of peo­ple liv­ing with de­men­tia in Sin­ga­pore is fore­cast to grow from more than 82,000 in 2018 to 240,000 peo­ple by 2050.</p>
    <p>While age­ing in place for per­sons with de­men­tia may be the ideal sit­u­a­tion, care­givers have to man­age the chal­lenges of bal­anc­ing fam­ily life with spe­cialised care.</p>
    <p>Lien Foun­da­tion ad­dresses this by part­ner­ing Ms Ong Ker-Shing and her team from Lekker Ar­chi­tects, a re­search and de­sign agency which ex­plores how the built en­vi­ron­ment af­fects peo­ple.</p>
    <p>It also worked with in­dus­trial de­sign stu­dio Lan­za­vec­chia + Wai to look at how de­sign can help em­power care­givers and re­store dig­nity to per­sons with de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>The hand­book is the latest ad­di­tion to the foun­da­tion’s list of pub­li­ca­tions af­ter Sec­ond Be­gin­nings (2018), which pre­sented 10 new ar­chi­tec­tural con­cepts of com­mu­nity spa­ces for seniors; A Dif­fer­ent Class (2014), a show­case of 10 ideas for pre-school spa­ces; and A Hos­pitable Hospice (2013), a hand­book of universal con­cepts and de­sign prin­ci­ples for fu­ture hos­pices.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Mr Lee Poh Wah, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the foun­da­tion, em­pa­thy is key, which “can­not be eas­ily in­sti­tu­tion­alised or re­placed by ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence sys­tems”.</p>
    <p>“The abil­ity to un­der­stand and ap­pre­ci­ate mean­ing­fully what oth­ers see, feel and ex­pe­ri­ence ul­ti­mately de­ter­mines suc­cess in de­sign,” says Mr Lee, 50.</p>
    <p>“The team demon­strates what de­sign­ing with em­pa­thy is. Their life ex­pe­ri­ences and, in par­tic­u­lar Shing’s, en­hanced their em­pa­thy and the dis­cov­ery of shared ex­pe­ri­ences with other care­givers.”</p>
    <p>Ms Ong, Hack Care de­signer and direc­tor of Lekker Ar­chi­tects, says de­vel­op­ing a “hacker’s men­tal­ity” is key when tak­ing care of a loved one with de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>“This pro­ject has both per­sonal and pro­fes­sional sig­nif­i­cance for</p>
    <p>This pro­ject has both per­sonal and pro­fes­sional sig­nif­i­cance for us. We have strug­gled in my fam­ily with the di­ag­no­sis of my fa­ther, who has de­men­tia. We have taken care of him at home and have tried to en­able him to live his fullest and most self-em­pow­ered life for as long as pos­si­ble. MS ONG KER-SHING (above left), Hack Care de­signer and direc­tor of Lekker Ar­chi­tects, which was com­mis­sioned by Lien Foun­da­tion to cre­ate the hand­book, on how her ex­pe­ri­ence in­formed the de­signs by her and her team</p>
    <p>us,” says the 45-year-old, who co-founded the ar­chi­tec­ture firm in 2014 with her hus­band Joshua Co­maroff, 47, an as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor at Yale-NUS Col­lege.</p>
    <p>“We have strug­gled in my fam­ily with the di­ag­no­sis of my fa­ther, who has de­men­tia. We have taken care of him at home and have tried to en­able him to live his fullest and most self-em­pow­ered life for as long as pos­si­ble,” says Ms Ong, whose fa­ther’s de­men­tia started 10 years ago and is now in an ad­vanced stage.</p>
    <p>She says that part of the im­pro­vi­sa­tion was also in adapt­ing to the pro­gres­sion of the disease.</p>
    <p>“It is an im­mensely dif­fi­cult ex­pe­ri­ence to go through, hav­ing a loved one suf­fer from de­men­tia,” she says.</p>
    <p>Dr Wong from Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal says de­men­tia also af­fects a per­son’s abil­ity to rea­son, per­ceive ex­ter­nal phys­i­cal space as well as un­der­stand and perform com­plex tasks.</p>
    <p>Per­sons with de­men­tia rely more on past rather than re­cent mem­o­ries as the abil­ity to re­tain in­for­ma­tion could be di­min­ished.</p>
    <p>Un­der­stand­ing this is im­por­tant, as it would as­sist de­sign­ers to think about en­vi­ron­ments to en­able in­de­pen­dent liv­ing, com­fort and safety while still re­tain­ing fa­mil­iar­ity and aes­thetic ap­peal, says Dr Wong.</p>
    <p>“A chair that is sta­ble, hav­ing a space that is un­clut­tered and with good colour con­trasts to min­imise con­fu­sion and falls, equip­ment that re­quires fewer steps to op­er­ate and tasks that re­quire fewer re­minders are im­por­tant,” says Dr Wong, who is also the deputy ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of the Geri­atric Ed­u­ca­tion & Re­search In­sti­tute in Yishun.</p>
    <p>“For lay per­sons, this would help them un­der­stand de­sign choices that may im­pact a per­son with de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>“It would also frame minds pos­i­tively to­wards age­ing and, hope­fully, help us make smart de­sign choices as we age.”</p>
