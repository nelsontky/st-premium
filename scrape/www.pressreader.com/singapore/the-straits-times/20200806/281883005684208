    <p>Sri Lanka’s Ra­japaksa fam­ily will likely con­sol­i­date power af­ter yes­ter­day’s par­lia­men­tary elec­tions. The pow­er­ful clan has held sway over the coun­try’s pol­i­tics for decades, as well as hav­ing a ma­jor in­flu­ence in key state in­sti­tu­tions such as the na­tional air­line and state cor­po­ra­tions. Close rel­a­tives have also been ap­pointed to top diplo­matic posts abroad. Here are its key mem­bers:</p>
    <p>‘THE PA­TRI­ARCH’</p>
    <p>Mahinda Ra­japaksa, 74, is the pa­tri­arch of the fam­ily and served as prime min­is­ter in 2004 and then pres­i­dent from 2005 un­til Jan­uary 2015.</p>
    <p>He was ap­pointed prime min­is­ter a sec­ond time by his brother Gotabaya in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Mahinda is adored by the Sin­hala-Bud­dhist ma­jor­ity for crush­ing sep­a­ratist Tamil rebels in May 2009 fol­low­ing a highly con­tro­ver­sial mil­i­tary of­fen­sive that ended a decades-long civil war.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing his rule, Sri Lanka also moved closer to China, bor­row­ing al­most US$7 bil­lion (S$9.6 bil­lion) for in­fra­struc­ture projects – many of which turned into white ele­phants mired in cor­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>‘THE TER­MI­NA­TOR’</p>
    <p>Gotabaya Ra­japaksa, 71, was the main lieu­tenant to Mahinda dur­ing his reign, hold­ing the in­flu­en­tial post of sec­re­tary to the min­istry of de­fence with re­spon­si­bil­ity for day-to-day con­trol of the armed forces and the po­lice.</p>
    <p>Dubbed “The Ter­mi­na­tor” by his own fam­ily, he is feared by foes for his short tem­per.</p>
    <p>He has faced sev­eral cor­rup­tion al­le­ga­tions, but his court cases have been frozen or with­drawn as he en­joys im­mu­nity af­ter win­ning the pres­i­dency last year.</p>
    <p>‘MR 10 PER CENT’</p>
    <p>Basil Ra­japaksa, 69, is a po­lit­i­cal strate­gist who man­aged the econ­omy un­der Mahinda.</p>
    <p>He was called “Mr 10 Per Cent”</p>
    <p>in a BBC in­ter­view in ref­er­ence to com­mis­sions that he al­legedly took from gov­ern­ment con­tracts.</p>
    <p>Sub­se­quent ad­min­is­tra­tions failed to prove any charges that he had si­phoned off mil­lions of dol­lars from state cof­fers, but he still faces sev­eral pros­e­cu­tions for cor­rup­tion and un­ex­plained wealth.</p>
    <p>As a dual United States-Sri Lankan cit­i­zen, he was pro­hib­ited from stand­ing for elected of­fice but is cur­rently a se­nior ad­viser to the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>‘THE BODY­GUARD’</p>
    <p>Chamal Ra­japaksa, 77, was Speaker of the Sri Lankan Par­lia­ment when brother Mahinda was pres­i­dent and is also a former min­is­ter of ship­ping and avi­a­tion.</p>
    <p>For­merly a po­lice of­fi­cer, he once served as a per­sonal body­guard to Mrs Sir­i­mavo Ban­daranaike, the world’s first fe­male prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>He is ex­pected to con­tinue to serve in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Cab­i­net in the new gov­ern­ment to be formed af­ter the polls.</p>
    <p>THE SCION</p>
    <p>Na­mal Ra­japaksa, 34, a lawyer, is the scion of the fam­ily dy­nasty and the el­dest son of Mahinda.</p>
    <p>He en­tered Par­lia­ment in 2010 aged just 24.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing his fa­ther’s decade in power, Na­mal was highly in­flu­en­tial al­though he did not hold any port­fo­lio.</p>
    <p>He has been ac­cused of money laun­der­ing and other cor­rup­tion charges, for which he still faces trial.</p>
    <p>He is ex­pected to play a key role in the new ad­min­is­tra­tion, and ob­servers say Mahinda is groom­ing him to be­come a fu­ture pres­i­dent.</p>
