    <p>Where: 83 Pasir Pan­jang Road Open: 6.30am to 3pm</p>
    <p>Rainy weather does not de­ter reg­u­lars from join­ing the lunch-hour queue at this stall, where the home-style dishes taste like what your grand­mother or mother would cook.</p>
    <p>The stall is named af­ter owner and cook Loh Soo Tian, 62. His wife, Madam Lim Gee Peng, 51, helps out.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple pre­pare up to 20 dishes a day. The daily menu changes de­pend­ing on the in­gre­di­ents avail­able. A hot favourite is curry vegetable ($0.70 on the rice; $2 for sep­a­rate serv­ing). A sta­ple dish at econ­omy rice stalls, the ver­sion here is out­stand­ing. The curry is aro­matic with co­conut milk and lemon­grass. The milky shade of orange looks de­cep­tively mild, but the gravy packs heat.</p>
    <p>As­sam fish (from $3.50 for a small piece to $5.50 for a large piece) may seem pricey, but the fish is fresh. When stock is avail­able, the stall uses lo­cally caught st­ingray. The tomato-laden sauce is thick and tangy. The dish also comes with hand­cut fresh honey pineap­ple and brin­jal.</p>
    <p>Dong cai meat­ball ($1.40 a piece served on the rice; $1.50 for sep­a­rate serv­ing) is par­tic­u­larly good. The minced meat is nat­u­rally flavoured with a gen­er­ous mix­ture of diced car­rot, pre­served vegetable and Chi­nese cel­ery.</p>
    <p>Fried dory ($1.40 a piece on the rice; $1.50 for sep­a­rate serv­ing) has a fluffy bat­ter. The fish is well-sea­soned, free of fishy odour and has a bouncy tex­ture.</p>
    <p>The afore­men­tioned dishes are usu­ally avail­able only on Wed­nes­days, but will be avail­able to­mor­row and on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>What is whipped up daily is fried chicken chop ($1.40 a piece on the rice; $1.50 for sep­a­rate serv­ing). Its dark shade of brown makes it look over­fried, but the in­te­rior of the bone­less chicken thigh is juicy. While the white pep­per is a tad over­whelm­ing, the chicken meat is tasty with the use of five-spice pow­der and gar­lic pow­der.</p>
    <p>The best time to go is at 12.30pm, when the fried chicken is served.</p>
