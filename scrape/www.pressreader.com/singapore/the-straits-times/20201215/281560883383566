    <p>Citibank Singapore will be hir­ing 330 re­la­tion­ship man­agers over the next five years for its newly opened wealth hub here. The hub, which of­fi­cially opened yesterday, is the bank’s largest wealth ad­vi­sory hub glob­ally. The bank also aims to triple the num­ber of its af­flu­ent clients by 2025 and dou­ble its as­sets un­der man­age­ment here.</p>
    <p>Citibank Singapore will be hir­ing 330 re­la­tion­ship man­agers over the next five years for its newly opened wealth hub here.</p>
    <p>The hub was of­fi­cially opened at 268 Orchard Road yesterday and is the bank’s largest wealth ad­vi­sory hub glob­ally. Citibank has moved 300 re­la­tion­ship man­agers, ad­vis­ers, spe­cial­ists and staff from other branches to the wealth hub.</p>
    <p>“With a rapidly grow­ing af­flu­ent client base in Singapore, the bank’s strat­egy is to fur­ther en­hance its ecosys­tem of dig­i­tal tools and wealth hubs, de­liver more in­no­va­tive mo­bile so­lu­tions and ex­pand its tal­ent pool,” Citi said in a me­dia state­ment.</p>
    <p>The bank also aims to dou­ble its as­sets un­der man­age­ment here and triple the num­ber of its af­flu­ent clients by 2025.</p>
    <p>“Citi has an enor­mous op­por­tu­nity to serve the grow­ing af­flu­ent seg­ment in Singapore. In line with our growth as­pi­ra­tion and de­spite a uniquely chal­leng­ing year, we grew qual­i­fied clients by close to 5 per cent in 2020 com­pared with 2019,” said Mr Bren­dan Car­ney, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Citibank Singapore and Asean clus­ter head of the global con­sumer bank­ing divi­sion.</p>
    <p>“Citi Wealth Hub at 268 Orchard will fur­ther en­hance our ca­pac­ity to serve our clients and bring bestin-class wealth man­age­ment so­lu­tions to them, as we lis­ten to their needs. We have bold goals for Singapore and this is only the be­gin­ning,” he added.</p>
    <p>The wealth hub oc­cu­pies an area of 30,000 sq ft across four floors. It houses more than 30 client ad­vi­sory rooms, in­clud­ing four pods in a gar­den-like set­ting.</p>
    <p>Rooms have QR codes for clients to ac­cess dig­i­tal menus and plas­tic bar­ri­ers to re­duce con­tact.</p>
    <p>The hub fea­tures built-in fa­cil­i­ties to host be­spoke life­style events for clients and in­vest­ment sem­i­nars.</p>
    <p>It will cater to Cit­igold and Cit­igold Pri­vate Client cus­tomers, and of­fer cash ser­vices and wealth man­age­ment ad­vi­sory, which in­cludes in­surance and in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>It ex­pects to serve about 150 clients a day with safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>The to­tal ca­pac­ity of the hub is about 600 peo­ple, in­clud­ing clients and staff. This is re­duced to about 500 with cur­rent re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>The bank said: “The open­ing of the hub re­flects Citi’s com­mit­ment to bet­ter serve wealth clients in Singapore, as the bank moves to el­e­vate the bank­ing ex­pe­ri­ence through strong dig­i­tal of­fer­ings to help clients man­age sim­ple daily bank­ing needs dig­i­tally, while han­dling the in­tri­ca­cies and needs of high-net-worth clients face to face.”</p>
    <p>It noted that each month, al­most 70 per cent of Citi’s re­tail bank­ing cus­tomers are log­ging onto the mo­bile ap­pli­ca­tion in Singapore.</p>
    <p>But while cus­tomers opt for dig­i­tal so­lu­tions to meet their daily bank­ing needs, most clients still pre­fer the hu­man touch for wealth ad­vi­sory, which can in­volve more com­plex trans­ac­tions, it added.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, Citi launched a de­posit ac­count to help clients con­sol­i­date their bank­ing ac­tiv­i­ties to earn higher in­ter­est rates on their Singapore dol­lar de­posits. Nearly 3,000 ac­counts have been opened, with 90 per cent of clients be­ing Cit­igold mem­bers and above.</p>
    <p>AT­TRACT­ING MORE CLIENTS</p>
    <p>In line with our growth as­pi­ra­tion and de­spite a uniquely chal­leng­ing year, we grew qual­i­fied clients by close to 5 per cent ’’ in 2020 com­pared with 2019.</p>
