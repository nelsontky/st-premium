    <p>The United States is end­ing re­stric­tions gov­ern­ing of­fi­cial con­tacts with Tai­wan, Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo said last Satur­day, a move hailed by Taipei as end­ing “decades of dis­crim­i­na­tion” but that ap­pears cer­tain to anger China, which sees Tai­wan as its own ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo yes­ter­day lifted “self-im­posed re­stric­tions” reg­u­lat­ing Amer­i­can diplo­mats, ser­vice mem­bers and other of­fi­cials’ in­ter­ac­tions with Tai­wanese coun­ter­parts.</p>
    <p>The move will not go down well with Bei­jing, which re­gards Tai­wan as a rene­gade prov­ince and one of its great­est sen­si­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>It also presents in­com­ing pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den with a new for­ward line on Tai­wan, on which he will find it dif­fi­cult to backpedal with­out ap­pear­ing soft on China – a la­bel that Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has tried to stick on him.</p>
    <p>“Tai­wan is a vi­brant democ­racy and re­li­able part­ner of the United States, and yet for sev­eral decades, the State Depart­ment has cre­ated com­plex in­ter­nal re­stric­tions to reg­u­late our diplo­mats, ser­vice mem­bers and other of­fi­cials’ in­ter­ac­tions with their Tai­wanese coun­ter­parts,” Mr Pom­peo said.</p>
    <p>“The United States gov­ern­ment took these ac­tions uni­lat­er­ally, in an at­tempt to ap­pease the com­mu­nist regime in Bei­jing. No more.”</p>
    <p>The US still main­tains the “oneChina” pol­icy which does not recog­nise Tai­wan as an in­de­pen­dent coun­try. That has en­tailed a va­ri­ety of open sub­terfuges as the US does en­gage with Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>But the lat­est move means that Tai­wanese and US of­fi­cials no longer need to main­tain the fa­cade of non-of­fi­cial ties – meet­ing in ho­tels, for in­stance, rather than at the US State Depart­ment; or at the his­toric, 133-year-old Twin Oaks, a Ge­or­gian man­sion in north-west Washington which is the Taipei</p>
    <p>NO MORE AP­PEASE­MENT ...for sev­eral decades, the State Depart­ment has cre­ated com­plex in­ter­nal re­stric­tions to reg­u­late our diplo­mats, ser­vice mem­bers and other of­fi­cials’ in­ter­ac­tions with their Tai­wanese coun­ter­parts. The United States gov­ern­ment took these ac­tions uni­lat­er­ally, in an at­tempt to ap­pease the com­mu­nist regime in Bei­jing. No more.</p>
    <p>US SEC­RE­TARY OF STATE MIKE POM­PEO CHAL­LENGE FOR BI­DEN</p>
    <p>It does re­flect the (cur­rent ad­min­is­tra­tion) try­ing to make things as dif­fi­cult as pos­si­ble for Bi­den to brake the free fall in US-China re­la­tions and put a floor un­der it, and begin to man­age com­pe­ti­tion and more clearly de­fine the terms of it.</p>
    <p>Eco­nomic and Cul­tural Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Of­fice. The of­fice is Tai­wan’s de facto em­bassy in the US.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan wel­comed the move. For­eign Min­is­ter Joseph Wu said: “The closer part­ner­ship be­tween Tai­wan and the US is firmly based on our shared val­ues, com­mon in­ter­ests and un­shake­able be­lief in free­dom and democ­racy.”</p>
    <p>Tai­wan has been try­ing for a long time to get the US to change the re­stric­tions on in­ter­ac­tions. The move comes with 10 days to go un­til the han­dover to Mr Bi­den</p>
    <p>in Washington.</p>
    <p>The Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion could ac­cept the new pol­icy, re­vert to the old or re­visit the en­tire is­sue, Ms Bonnie Glaser, se­nior ad­viser for Asia and di­rec­tor of the China Power Pro­ject at the Cen­tre for Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies in Washington, told The Straits Times. But “the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will rightly be un­happy that a pol­icy de­ci­sion like this was made in the fi­nal days of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion”, she said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the US Am­bas­sador</p>
    <p>to the United Na­tions Kelly Craft is due to visit Tai­wan from Wed­nes­day to Fri­day, just days be­fore Mr Bi­den’s in­au­gu­ra­tion on Jan 20.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo called Tai­wan a “re­li­able part­ner and vi­brant democ­racy that has flour­ished de­spite the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party’s ef­forts to un­der­mine its great suc­cess”. This con­firmed China pol­icy an­a­lysts’ view that the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion sees Tai­wan as an is­sue it can use against Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to Ms Craft’s up­com­ing trip, China’s UN mis­sion</p>
    <p>warned that “who­ever plays with fire will burn him­self”.</p>
    <p>Dr Robert Man­ning, res­i­dent se­nior fel­low at the Washington think-tank At­lantic Coun­cil, told ST: “Much of this seems mind­less pok­ing the dragon to show how much we love Tai­wan, usu­ally with ex­actly the op­po­site ef­fect – re­sult­ing in Bei­jing feel­ing com­pelled to re­spond in kind by putting more pres­sure on Tai­wan.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den is ex­pected to take a less openly ad­ver­sar­ial ap­proach to China than the Trump ad­mi­nis</p>

    <p>tra­tion, look­ing for ways to co­ex­ist. The US-China re­la­tion­ship has plunged to the low­est level in decades and the sit­u­a­tion is al­ready be­ing called a new Cold War.</p>
    <p>“It does re­flect the (cur­rent ad­min­is­tra­tion) try­ing to make things as dif­fi­cult as pos­si­ble for Bi­den to brake the free fall in USChina re­la­tions and put a floor un­der it, and begin to man­age com­pe­ti­tion and more clearly de­fine the terms of it,” said Dr Man­ning.</p>
