    <p>With a more in­fec­tious strain of Covid-19 in the com­mu­nity and tight re­stric­tions on gath­er­ings, Christ­mas in Britain was a silent, soli­tary af­fair for many Sin­ga­pore­ans there.</p>
    <p>Many told The Sunday Times that they had looked for­ward to a Christ­mas respite of small gath­er­ings, as Britain orig­i­nally planned to re­lax re­stric­tions for the festive pe­riod.</p>
    <p>But their hopes were dashed when a new vari­ant of the virus forced Lon­don and other parts of Eng­land into its most se­vere lock­down yet.</p>
    <p>Mr Pranav Varma, 22, a stu­dent at Univer­sity Col­lege Lon­don said news of the virus mu­ta­tion and tier four lock­down mea­sures hit like “a sucker punch”.</p>
    <p>The 11th-hour an­nounce­ment of tight lock­down mea­sures not only scup­pered meet-up plans, but also brought on anger and frus­tra­tion, said Mr Lim Xiu Jie, 22, a stu­dent at the Univer­sity of Sur­rey.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim was among the for­tu­nate ones: As he is liv­ing with three other Sin­ga­pore­ans, they could en­joy a home-cooked dinner to­gether. But oth­ers who were liv­ing alone had to make do with vir­tual greet­ings and text mes­sages from friends back home.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures were par­tic­u­larly hard to swal­low for stu­dents, as many had re­turned to Britain with the un­der­stand­ing that their uni</p>
    <p>ver­si­ties would be re­sum­ing in-per­son classes. Over the sum­mer, cases in Sin­ga­pore had been climb­ing while those in Lon­don re­mained largely sta­ble.</p>
    <p>Now, the sit­u­a­tions were re­versed. A week af­ter Sin­ga­pore an­nounced that phase three of its re­open­ing would com­mence to­mor­row, Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son in­tro­duced tier four Covid-19 curbs, up­end­ing the Yule­tide sea­son.</p>
    <p>Tier four rules mean non-es­sen­tial shops must stay closed, and house­holds are not al­lowed to mix.</p>
    <p>“This has been the most chal­leng­ing Christ­mas I’ve had in my life,” said Mr Lim, as it was his first spent away from both fam­ily and friends.</p>
    <p>“It’s dif­fi­cult see­ing things get so much better (in Sin­ga­pore) with ev</p>
    <p>ery­one out and about, while things get worse here.”</p>
    <p>In Britain, mil­lions more faced tougher coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions from yesterday, as the coun­try strug­gled to con­tain the spread of the new virus strain.</p>
    <p>In Eng­land, six mil­lion more peo­ple en­tered the tough­est tier-four re­stric­tions, while new lock­downs be­gan in Scot­land and North­ern Ire­land. In Wales, re­stric­tions that were eased for Christ­mas Day were reim­posed yesterday.</p>
    <p>Britain recorded 570 new deaths on Christ­mas Day, tak­ing its to­tal deaths within 28 days of a pos­i­tive test to 70,195.</p>
    <p>Any Christ­mas cheer was hard to come by in re­cent days, which were marked by re­ports of pan­icbuy­ing as more Lon­don­ers hun</p>
    <p>kered down. Su­per­mar­ket chains such as Sains­bury’s had warned of likely short­ages of fruits and veg­eta­bles, as coun­tries like France closed its bor­der to Bri­tish trucks in the light of the new virus strain.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, food short­ages did not oc­cur, even though some gro­cers had their shelves wiped clean ear­lier in the week.</p>
    <p>More lam­en­ta­ble was that tra­di­tional Christ­mas stand-bys like the Christ­mas mar­ket at Bor­ough Mar­ket and Win­ter Won­der­land did not take place this year, and even plucky ef­forts to light up the annual dec­o­ra­tions in Ox­ford Street did lit­tle to sal­vage the mood, Sin­ga­pore­ans told The Sunday Times.</p>
    <p>“Christ­mas was ba­si­cally can­celled,” said Mr Varma. “It’s a bit sad to see places like Ox­ford Street</p>
    <p>com­pletely empty with no one out.”</p>
    <p>But some have made the best of a bad sit­u­a­tion. House­wife and part­time teacher Radha Nair, 37, still whipped up the £120 worth of turkey and other food she had or­dered for a Christ­mas party to be had with two other Sin­ga­porean fam­i­lies be­fore their plans were dashed.</p>
    <p>With large Christ­mas events can­celled, she paid £15 (S$27) for her two young chil­dren to in­ter­act vir­tu­ally with Santa over a Zoom call.</p>
    <p>She said: “I don’t want to sit here de­pressed and up­set. My fam­ily has been long­ing for Christ­mas, but we’re tak­ing this lock­down in our stride and find­ing ways to cel­e­brate as cosily as we can.”</p>
