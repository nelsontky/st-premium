    <p>If you have spent any time at the beach, you will know that Sin­ga­pore lacks the crys­tal clear wa­ters that divers at re­gional dive haunts like Si­padan, Raja Am­pat and Bali take for granted.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, as th­ese dive spots are off-lim­its dur­ing the pan­demic, the “crazy” idea to do a lo­cal dive trip came up.</p>
    <p>A bit of search­ing on the Web led us to the YouTube chan­nel of Mr Robert Tan, who goes by the nick­name MRT-atis and reg­u­larly posts videos of his dives at Pu­lau Hantu, off Pu­lau Bukom, i n south­ern Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>My wife and two sons de­cided to see for our­selves if the videos he posted of cut­tle­fish, shrimp and nudi­branchs were for real and signed our­selves up for a dive trip with him.</p>
    <p>Our morn­ing trip be­gan from the Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Yacht Club off West Coast Road, where we took a 30-minute boat ride to Pu­lau Hantu (Is­land of Ghosts).</p>
    <p>A friend of mine ques­tioned the wis­dom of div­ing at Pu­lau Hantu dur­ing the Sev­enth Month, when the Chi­nese be­lieve that hun­gry ghosts are re­leased from hell. He felt that we were tempt­ing fate.</p>
    <p>In truth, I was more wor­ried about bad weather than hun­gry ghosts. Septem­ber has been a rainy month and af­ter it rained for al­most 24 hours, just be­fore our trip, we were blessed with a clear morn­ing with blue skies and calm wa­ters.</p>
    <p>Soon af­ter the boat pulled up to Pu­lau Hantu Kechil, the smaller of the two Hantu is­lands, the four of us put on our gear and jumped in. It felt un­canny to pull on dive gear with­out first get­ting on a flight.</p>
    <p>Div­ing lo­cally is a study in con­trasts. The wa­ters off Hantu teem with schools of fish swim­ming on the sur­face. But once you get in the wa­ter, the fish “dis­ap­pear” be­cause of poor vis­i­bil­ity due to silt.</p>
    <p>While vis­i­bil­ity dur­ing our dive trip was at most 3m, the wa­ter was sur­pris­ingly clean. We found no lit­ter or trash un­der­wa­ter. Our fam­ily prac­tice is to pick up trash dur­ing our dives. We sur­faced from both our dives empty-handed.</p>
    <p>There was plenty to see un­der­wa­ter: fish, coral, nudi­branchs of all shapes and colours, sea­horses and other sea crit­ters.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing one of our dives, we swam with one of the tamest bat­fish that we have ever met. It was so used to divers be­ing around that we could get close enough to al­most touch it. It con­tin­ued feed­ing near us, as if to say: “You do your thing, I’ll do mine.”</p>
    <p>We were thrilled to spend time with the res­i­dent rock fish of Hantu and to chance upon cut­tle­fish eggs that we had never seen be­fore.</p>
    <p>In be­tween dives, we wit­nessed a gar­den eel perched off a patch of sea­weed un­der the Hantu j etty, pick­ing off cu­ri­ous small fish drawn to the dive boat.</p>
    <p>The life in the reefs and the re­splen­dent vi­brance of the coral are a tes­ta­ment to the ex­cel­lent work done by the Na­tional Parks Board in ma­rine con­ser­va­tion over the years.</p>
    <p>But take note that for th­ese dive trips, divers must be rea­son­ably pro­fi­cient in their skills and be able to set up their own gear and tanks. In ad­di­tion, they should be able to deal with cur­rent and poor vis­i­bil­ity in the wa­ter and know what to do if they are sep­a­rated from their dive buddy or dive group.</p>
    <p>The Hantu dives re­minded me of my dives in Is­rael, where divers are ex­pected to rely on their own skills and gear, with­out the safety net of a dive guide com­ing to the res­cue if they run into is­sues.</p>
    <p>We en­joyed do­ing our own thing as a fam­ily. Not be­ing with a dive guide was lib­er­at­ing. Our boys have done more than 50 dives and my wife and I have clocked 100, so we en­joyed set­ting our own dive routes and ex­plor­ing Hantu’s un­der­wa­ter trea­sures in­de­pen­dently.</p>
    <p>While on the dive boat, so­cial dis­tanc­ing was ob­served at all times, with a max­i­mum of five peo­ple in each area of the boat and face masks be­ing worn, un­less some­one was eat­ing or drink­ing or just be­fore one en­tered the wa­ter.</p>
    <p>What’s the verdict on div­ing in Sin­ga­pore? The dives re­freshed us and were a great time to bond as a fam­ily. I am pleased to find Sin­ga­pore a Gar­den City, both above wa­ter and be­low it.</p>
    <p>The writer paid for th­ese dives. He writes an oc­ca­sional col­umn for The Sun­day Times and is the chief ex­ec­u­tive of a med­i­cal tech­nol­ogy com­pany.</p>
