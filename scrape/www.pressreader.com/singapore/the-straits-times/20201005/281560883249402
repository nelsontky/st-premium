    <p>The pan­demic will fur­ther un­der­mine the use of cash amid a shift by con­sumers to­wards e-com­merce and dig­i­tal pay­ments. A report es­ti­mated that cash in Sin­ga­pore will be used in 39 per cent of all trans­ac­tions this year, down from 59 per cent in 2010.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic will fur­ther un­der­mine the use of cash amid a shift by con­sumers to­wards e-com­merce and dig­i­tal pay­ments, a report noted.</p>
    <p>It es­ti­mated that cash in Sin­ga­pore will be used in 39 per cent of all trans­ac­tions this year, down from 59 per cent in 2010.</p>
    <p>It also found that al­ter­na­tive op­tions such as in­stant and mo­bile pay­ments grew in Asia, while credit cards re­tained their strong po­si­tion sup­port­ing e-com­merce and pointof-sale trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, the pan­demic has also ac­cel­er­ated the move from phys­i­cal to vir­tual bank­ing, with banks in var­i­ous coun­tries clos­ing branches and ATMs, noted the an­nual report from man­age­ment con­sult­ing firm McKin­sey & Com­pany.</p>
    <p>“These ac­cel­er­ated be­hav­iour changes in re­sponse to the Covid-19 cri­sis caused a fun­da­men­tal shift in adop­tion of tech­nolo­gies. In­vest­ments in in­stant pay­ments have be­gun to reap greater ben­e­fits, both in point-of-sale and e-com­merce,” said the report.</p>
    <p>It added that the shift to­wards pay­ment tech­nolo­gies has been fu­elled by cus­tomer ex­pec­ta­tions for speed, price dif­fer­ences and higher adop­tion of ap­pli­ca­tions such as GrabPay in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Global pay­ments rev­enue this year is ex­pected to fall 7 per cent com­pared with last year as the pan­demic has damp­ened dis­cre­tionary spend­ing, es­pe­cially on travel and en­ter­tain­ment.</p>
    <p>The Asia-Pa­cific con­tin­ued to dom­i­nate global pay­ments rev­enue, ac­count­ing for 45 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>The report added that the shift to elec­tronic trans­ac­tions has in­creased the need for mer­chant ac­quir­ing com­pa­nies to up­date and dif­fer­en­ti­ate their ser­vices.</p>
    <p>A mer­chant ac­quirer helps busi­nesses process debit or credit card pay­ments for their cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>“Glob­ally, mer­chant ac­quir­ing has evolved over the past decade from a legacy pro­cess­ing and hard­ware business to a full-stack soft­ware and mer­chant ser­vices so­lu­tion,” the report said.</p>
    <p>The dig­i­tal shift is also ex­pected to drive up mer­chants’ pay­ments-ac­cep­tance costs, which are ex­pected to rise by about 6 to 10 per cent – or $8 bil­lion to $15 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Mer­chants also face higher de­cline and fraud rates on dig­i­tal trans­ac­tions, with con­se­quences for cus­tomer ex­pe­ri­ence, said the report.</p>
    <p>As some mer­chants con­sol­i­date their share of dig­i­tal sales, they nat­u­rally seek to lower their cost of ac­cep­tance, which in turn ad­versely im­pacts mar­gins for ac­quir­ers, said the report.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion of com­merce has cre­ated greater will­ing­ness to pay for en­hanced ser­vices and so­lu­tions. Mer­chants are will­ing to ac­cept higher fees for demon­strated value, such as im­proved au­tho­ri­sa­tion rates and a more seam­less pay­ments ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>Most of the rev­enue growth for mer­chant ser­vice providers came from small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) as these busi­nesses un­dergo dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion, a trend ac­cel­er­ated by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>SMEs ac­counted for about three­quar­ters of all new rev­enue growth in the mer­chant ser­vices space over the past three years.</p>
