    <p>Sin­ga­pore and Ja­pan have launched a “res­i­dence track” for busi­ness ex­ec­u­tives and pro­fes­sion­als who are work pass hold­ers, in ad­di­tion to an ear­lier re­cip­ro­cal green lane cater­ing mainly for short-term busi­ness trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­ca­tions for the res­i­dence track will start next Wed­nes­day, said Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs (MFA) in a state­ment yes­ter­day .</p>
    <p>Both sides have been in dis­cus­sions since July on the res­i­dence track, said MFA, adding that nec­es­sary pub­lic health safe­guards will be in place.</p>
    <p>It comes in ad­di­tion to the re­cip­ro­cal green lane, also known as the busi­ness track, which was launched on Fri­day last week and is for short­term es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial travel be­tween both coun­tries.</p>
    <p>This will help re­store con­nec­tiv­ity and sup­port eco­nomic re­cov­ery for Sin­ga­pore and Ja­pan, both For­eign Af­fairs min­istries said in an ear­lier joint state­ment on Sept 11.</p>
    <p>Last month, For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan and his Ja­panese coun­ter­part Toshim­itsu Motegi said the two coun­tries were in talks to set up the two tracks that will al­low cross-bor­der travel.</p>
    <p>More de­tails on the res­i­dence track in­clud­ing the el­i­gi­bil­ity re­quire­ments, health pro­to­cols and ap­pli­ca­tion process will be pub­lished on the web­sites of both min­istries be­fore Sept 30.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore cur­rently per­mits vis­i­tors from Brunei, China, Malaysia, New Zealand and South Korea, with a var­ied num­ber of re­stric­tions in place.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said in a state­ment that a new busi­ness travel pass is be­ing pi­loted for se­nior ex­ec­u­tives in</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore with re­gional or in­ter­na­tional re­spon­si­bil­i­ties who need to travel reg­u­larly for of­fi­cial and busi­ness pur­poses.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers on this pass, which is not coun­try-spe­cific, will be re­quired to abide by a strict, con­trolled itin­er­ary when they travel abroad for work.</p>
    <p>Upon re­turn, the trav­eller will be given the op­tion of tak­ing a Covid-19 test in lieu of serv­ing a stay-home no­tice, and self-iso­lat­ing un­til the re­sults are out.</p>
    <p>MOH said the num­ber of passes will be strictly lim­ited in the ini­tial phase to en­sure that pub­lic health out­comes of this pi­lot can be mon­i­tored.</p>
    <p>“If the pi­lot is suc­cess­ful, and pub­lic health mea­sures are fully abided by, we will con­sider ex­pand­ing the scheme in a safe and cal­i­brated man­ner,” it added.</p>
