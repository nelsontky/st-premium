    <p>I hope a smok­ing ban will be in­tro­duced and will ex­tend to smok­ing around landed prop­er­ties (Ban smok­ing near win­dows and on bal­conies in homes, says Louis Ng, ST On­line, Oct 5).</p>
    <p>I wish to high­light one statis­tic: Out of all the smok­ing com­plaints re­ceived by the au­thor­i­ties, only 320, or 5 per cent, in­volved smok­ing in homes. This is prob­a­bly a gross un­der-rep­re­sen­ta­tion of the true num­ber of vic­tims of sec­ond-hand smoke.</p>
    <p>I live in a landed prop­erty and have neigh­bours who smoke. Cig­a­rette and cigar smoke drift into our house, par­tic­u­larly at night and on week­ends when ev­ery­one is home. Even with the doors and win­dows closed, the smoke en­ters through gaps be­tween the open­ings.</p>
    <p>We are thus trapped in­doors, un­able to en­joy fresh air or the use of our out­door space when­ever they are smok­ing, for as long as the stench lingers.</p>
    <p>I have never com­plained to the au­thor­i­ties – I felt that with no law in place, I would just be told that they have a right to smoke within their own com­pound.</p>
    <p>We have not spo­ken to our neigh­bours about this.</p>
    <p>If smok­ers would sub­ject their own fam­ily mem­bers to sec­ond-hand smoke, what chance would there be of them lis­ten­ing to neigh­bours?</p>
    <p>I be­lieve many vic­tims have not lodged com­plaints against their neigh­bours for sim­i­lar rea­sons.</p>
    <p>The ill-ef­fects of sec­ond- and third-hand smoke (the chem­i­cal residue of to­bacco smoke on sur­faces) are in­con­tro­vert­ible.</p>
    <p>There­fore, al­low­ing sec­ond-hand smoke to af­fect a fam­ily mem­ber or drift to neigh­bours’ homes should be treated as se­ri­ously as bat­tery – an act that causes phys­i­cal harm.</p>
    <p>We should not let dif­fi­cul­ties of en­force­ment pre­vent us from tak­ing the first step of pass­ing this law to pro­tect in­no­cent vic­tims. In fact, we can even take a leaf out of Thai­land’s book and ban smok­ing in homes al­to­gether.</p>
