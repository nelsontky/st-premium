    <p>Af­ter The On­line Ci­ti­zen (TOC) ed­i­tor Terry Xu met Mr Lee Hsien Yang for lunch on Nov 4 this year, he de­cided not to subpoena him and Dr Lee Wei Ling, as he re­alised they could not es­tab­lish the truth of their al­le­ga­tions, ar­gued Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong’s lawyer yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In his cross-ex­am­i­na­tion of Mr Xu, Se­nior Coun­sel Davin­der Singh noted that Mr Xu’s lawyers wrote to the court on Nov 4, af­ter the lunch, to say they would not be pro­ceed­ing with their claims against PM Lee’s sib­lings as third par­ties in PM Lee’s defama­tion suit against Mr Xu.</p>
    <p>“This lunch would have been fixed be­fore Nov 4. So you had am­ple op­por­tu­nity to serve the subpoena on Mr Lee Hsien Yang on Nov 4,” said Mr Singh.</p>
    <p>“It would ap­pear, Mr Xu, that some­thing took place at that lunch for you to de­cide not to pro­ceed with the third-party pro­ceed­ings.”</p>
    <p>Deny­ing this, Mr Xu said he had made his de­ci­sion ear­lier. He said that in March, he had ob­tained copies of cer­tain doc­u­ments that emerged at a dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal’s in­ves­ti­ga­tions into a case of mis­con­duct in­volv­ing Mr Lee Hsien Yang’s wife, se­nior lawyer Lee Suet Fern.</p>
    <p>The doc­u­ments were not dis­puted by PM Lee or his sib­lings, Mr Xu noted, adding he viewed them as more re­li­able than doc­u­ments that PM Lee’s sib­lings had pub­licly re­leased ear­lier, on which Mr Xu had based his ini­tial de­fence. It was thus “not para­mount” to call them as wit­nesses, he said.</p>
    <p>But Mr Singh noted there was noth­ing in the e-mails that emerged from the tri­bunal’s in­ves­ti­ga­tions that proved PM Lee had mis­led his late father into thinking the 38 Ox­ley Road house had been gazetted. This was one of the al­legedly defam­a­tory claims Mr Xu had made in the TOC ar­ti­cle that led to the li­bel suit.</p>
    <p>“So, know­ing there were no such e-mails, it was all the more nec­es­sary for you to subpoena Mr Lee Hsien Yang to give ev­i­dence of what he claimed was said, cor­rect?” Mr Singh asked.</p>
    <p>Mr Xu dis­agreed.</p>
    <p>When pressed by Jus­tice Au­drey Lim on why he dropped the third­party claims, Mr Xu said he had thought it was too late to pro­ceed by the time the ques­tion was raised to him in Oc­to­ber, as it was close to the date of the hear­ing.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Lim then asked if the court had ever told Mr Xu he could not pro­ceed with the third-party claims, to which he replied that it had not. “So you dropped it on your own vo­li­tion?” she asked.</p>
    <p>“Yes,” he replied.</p>
    <p>“It is not like the court gave you the im­pres­sion that you could not pro­ceed with the third-party claim?” asked Jus­tice Lim.</p>
    <p>“That’s not the case,” Mr Xu said. Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s lawyer, Ms Kwa Kim Li, may ap­pear in court to give ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>Lawyer Lim Tean, who is rep­re­sent­ing Mr Xu, told re­porters af­ter yes­ter­day’s hear­ing that Ms Kwa had been served a subpoena and was “try­ing to have it set aside”.</p>
    <p>Ms Kwa, who han­dled the late Mr Lee’s six wills be­fore his fi­nal will which she did not pre­pare, may take the wit­ness stand to­day or to­mor­row if Mr Lim’s subpoena is suc­cess­ful.</p>
