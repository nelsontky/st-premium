    <p>Hav­ing made waves in their com­pet­i­tive ca­reers, Par­a­lympian swim­mers Theresa Goh and Yip Pin Xiu will also be look­ing to do the same out­side the pool by putting their names up to join the Singapore Dis­abil­ity Sports Coun­cil’s (SDSC) ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee at its an­nual gen­eral meet­ing (AGM) on Sept 29.</p>
    <p>The duo are stand­ing as in­di­vid­ual mem­bers and their po­si­tions are un­con­tested fol­low­ing the clos­ing of nom­i­na­tions last month.</p>
    <p>The AGM will see in­cum­bent pres­i­dent Kevin Wong step down af­ter the con­clu­sion of his ten­ure limit of four years. He will be re­placed by Teo-Koh Sock Miang, who was pres­i­dent from 2014 to 2016 and is re­turn­ing un­op­posed.</p>
    <p>Three-gold Par­a­lympic cham­pion Yip told The Straits Times she hopes to con­trib­ute by grow­ing the base of ath­letes and en­cour­ag­ing peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties to play sport.</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing her­self as “a prod­uct of sport”, the 28-year-old said: “I think it’s still about start­ing from a big­ger base of ath­letes so that even­tu­ally when you’re at the top of the pyra­mid you can pick the elite few to go up. At the end of the day it’s about trans­form­ing peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties’ lives through sport.”</p>
    <p>She also ac­knowl­edged con­cerns about a pos­si­ble con­flict of in­ter­est given that she is still com­pet­ing, say­ing: “We’re re­ally pas­sion­ate about this, hav­ing grown up in the sys­tem. Be­ing part of the exco is a lot more than just about high per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>“If there’s any­thing the exco feels I should not be talk­ing about, (whether) swim­ming or high per­for­mance, I’ll gladly step out. I think there might be this worry that I will tell the other ath­letes things. I can eas­ily sign a non-dis­clo­sure agree­ment so that things can be worked around. I’ve spo­ken to a few (mem­bers of the exco) and they’re quite okay (with this ar­range­ment).”</p>
    <p>Goh, who won bronze at the 2016 Par­a­lympic Games in Rio, added: “It’s all about do­ing some­thing for the peo­ple, by the peo­ple. If you’re do­ing some­thing and it’s very ath­lete-cen­tric, why would you not want to gather the thoughts and ideas of ath­letes? You’d also need a va­ri­ety of ath­letes be­cause they are the ones cur­rently go­ing through the sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“A lot of the or­gan­i­sa­tions out there are very much run by peo­ple who are no longer in the ac­tive scene and you see a lot of prob­lems come up be­cause the fact is, they are no longer in touch with the ground.”</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old, who re­tired last year, said of her de­ci­sion to be a part of the SDSC exco: “I de­cided to do it now be­cause I feel like I have more en­ergy and time to fo­cus com­pared to when I was an ath­lete.”</p>
    <p>She added: “Be­ing an ath­lete, you think, ‘This is my role and this is what I want to do, these are the de­ci­sions and choices I can make.’</p>
    <p>“But that is also af­fected by peo­ple at the top and then you don’t know what they’re go­ing through be­cause you’re not there. So putting my­self there will be able to give me a big­ger pic­ture on maybe how things are run.”</p>
    <p>The big­ger goal, said Goh, is to move dis­abil­ity sports for­ward, which can be done by align­ing with part­ners and hav­ing bet­ter poli­cies or bet­ter pro­gram­ming.</p>
    <p>Yip be­lieves her ex­pe­ri­ence as a Nom­i­nated Mem­ber of Par­lia­ment (NMP) from 2018 to this year will help by en­cour­ag­ing her to “reach out to peo­ple to help them un­der­stand what the SDSC is about, what dis­abil­ity sports can do and how it can ben­e­fit many peo­ple, and why I think this is im­por­tant”.</p>
    <p>Re­call­ing that she had few reser­va­tions about putting her name up for the po­si­tion, Yip said: “Af­ter (be­ing an NMP) I also got to know a bit more about SDSC and its chal­lenges, and I just felt I was ready.”</p>

Goh wants to serve on the SDSC&#x2019;s exco now that she has more en&#xAD;ergy and time while Yip wants to get more ath&#xAD;letes with dis&#xAD;abil&#xAD;i&#xAD;ties to play sport.</p>
