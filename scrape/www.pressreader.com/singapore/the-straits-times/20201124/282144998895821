    <p>A pi­ano teacher with autism who mo­lested his five-year-old pupil was sen­tenced to three years’ pro­ba­tion yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In sen­tenc­ing, the High Court judge said he had con­sid­ered the fact that the man, now 23, would suf­fer dis­pro­por­tion­ately in prison be­cause of his autism spec­trum disorder, among other fac­tors such as his suit­abil­ity for pro­ba­tion and the progress he has made to re­form.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Jus­tice Pang Khang Chau fur­ther noted that this does not mean that all of­fend­ers with autism spec­trum disorder should not be jailed, or that the prison ser­vice is in­ca­pable of tak­ing care of people with the disorder.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Pang said he was sim­ply recog­nis­ing the “un­de­ni­able fact” that a jail term, as the pros­e­cu­tion had orig­i­nally sought, would have a dif­fer­ent im­pact on the man as com­pared with other people of his age.</p>
    <p>He agreed with the de­fence’s ar­gu­ment that re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion should be the pri­mary sen­tenc­ing con­sid­er­a­tion in this case, as the man was a young of­fender who com­mit­ted the of­fence when he was 19.</p>
    <p>The man, who can­not be named to pro­tect the iden­tity of his victim, will have to com­plete 100 hours of com­mu­nity ser­vice, and can­not be with any­one be­low 12 years old with­out be­ing su­per­vised by his par­ents or older sib­ling.</p>
    <p>He can­not be em­ployed in any child-re­lated vo­ca­tions and he is not to ac­cess any pornog­ra­phy or sex­u­ally sug­ges­tive ma­te­rial, the High Court judge or­dered.</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors had orig­i­nally sought 18 months’ jail, while the man’s de­fence coun­sels from Withers Khat­tarWong called for pro­ba­tion.</p>
    <p>The man pleaded guilty in April last year.</p>
    <p>He was teach­ing part-time at a pi­ano stu­dio when he mo­lested his stu­dent on Nov 7, 2016.</p>
    <p>He was alone with the girl in the pi­ano stu­dio when he slipped his hand inside her un­der­wear, on the pre­text of cor­rect­ing her pos­ture.</p>
    <p>The man scratched the girl around her gen­i­tal area and con­tin­ued do­ing so even af­ter she told him to stop.</p>
    <p>The of­fence was dis­cov­ered when the girl’s mother found her cry­ing in pain in the toi­let at home. It took two weeks for the girl’s phys­i­cal in­juries to heal, and she had to see a coun­sel­lor af­ter the in­ci­dent.</p>
