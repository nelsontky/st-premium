    <p>Lo­cal ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) start-up Nex­tBil­lion.ai was crowned win­ner of En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore’s start-up com­pe­ti­tion Sling­shot yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It beat nine other fi­nal­ists from such coun­tries as Canada, Is­rael and Bri­tain to take home a $200,000 Startup SG grant, $50,000 in cash and six months’ use of a ser­viced of­fice space.</p>
    <p>About 7,500 start-ups from 159 coun­tries took part in this year’s com­pe­ti­tion, and the top 10 pitched their ideas virtually to a panel of judges yes­ter­day at the Sin­ga­pore Fin­Tech Fes­ti­val and Sin­ga­pore Week of In­no­va­tion and Tech­nol­ogy. Among the judges were B Cap­i­tal co-founder and man­ag­ing part­ner Eduardo Saverin, a co­founder of Face­book, and Mr For­rest Li, founder of tech gi­ant Sea, which has busi­nesses in dig­i­tal fi­nance and owns e-com­merce plat­form Shopee.</p>
    <p>Two Bri­tish-based start-ups, med­i­cal de­vice maker Gy­roGear and cy­ber-se­cu­rity com­pany Key­less Tech­nolo­gies, came in sec­ond and third re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Over $900,000 of grants and cash prizes were given out this year, the fourth edi­tion of Sling­shot.</p>
    <p>Nex­tBil­lion.ai, which builds map­ping and other AI-based ser­vices, was founded ear­lier this year by former Grab ex­ec­u­tives Gau­rav Bubna, Ajay Bu­lusu and Zheng Shaolin. In June, it raised US$7 mil­lion (S$9.4 mil­lion) in its Se­ries A fund­ing round led by ven­ture cap­i­tal firms Light­speed Ven­ture Part­ners and Fal­con Edge Cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>Mr Bu­lusu said: “The real work starts now and our aim is to build a global deep tech SaaS (soft­ware as a ser­vice) com­pany out of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Lo­ca­tion will and al­ways be at the heart of Nex­tBil­lion.ai and we hope we en­able en­ter­prises across the world with the best ecosys­tem pos­si­ble to run their busi­nesses.”</p>
    <p>Each of the 10 fi­nal­ists, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore-based start-ups Knowl­edge Nav­i­ga­tor, Crayon Data and Trans­ferFi, were awarded a $50,000 Startup SG grant.</p>
    <p>Dutch dig­i­tal so­lu­tions start-up Sur­fly won the Sling­shot Covid-19 Chal­lenge, a new cat­e­gory in this year’s com­pe­ti­tion. It gar­nered the most in­ter­est in terms of in­vest­ment and co-in­no­va­tion from judges. The firm has de­vel­oped co­brows­ing and video chat tech­nol­ogy that en­ables peo­ple to con­nect and col­lab­o­rate on­line quickly and se­curely, and took home $60,000 worth of prizes.</p>
    <p>In the lead-up to yes­ter­day’s fi­nals, the top 100 start-ups at­tended a week-long vir­tual pro­gramme that com­prised prepara­tory work­shops and men­tor­ing ses­sions. El­i­gi­ble in­ter­na­tional startup founders among them will re­ceive an En­trePass, a work visa for en­trepreneur­s to set up a new busi­ness in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The start-ups im­pressed Mr Saverin, who said: “It’s in­spir­ing to see the pas­sion and con­vic­tion the founders bring to solv­ing prob­lems in vastly dif­fer­ent in­dus­tries – from im­prov­ing the qual­ity of life of those suf­fer­ing from chronic med­i­cal con­di­tions to driv­ing im­prove­ments in lo­gis­tics via map­ping in­no­va­tion.”</p>
    <p>Be­yond the prize money, such com­pe­ti­tions are im­por­tant driv­ers for en­trepreneur­s as they also help founders con­nect with com­pa­nies, po­ten­tial cus­tomers and men­tors, he added. “Ad­di­tion­ally, founders get to con­nect and learn from other founders, en­abling a com­mu­nity of en­trepreneur­s to help each other along the very chal­leng­ing start-up jour­ney.”</p>
