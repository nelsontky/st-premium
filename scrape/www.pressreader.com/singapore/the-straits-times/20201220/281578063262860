    <p>As Sin­ga­pore pro­gresses to­wards phase three, those call­ing for re­stric­tions on mi­grant work­ers to be loos­ened are miss­ing the larger is­sues, said Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Man­power Tan See Leng yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This phase of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing, which be­gins on Dec 28, is not a re­turn to the pre-Covid-19 sta­tus quo, said Dr Tan, who is also Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try.</p>
    <p>He added that now is not the time for peo­ple to let their guard down as there is a risk of a re-emer­gence of Covid-19 among mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>Some in­ter­na­tional media out­lets and lo­cal non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions (NGOs) have said it is un­fair for re­stric­tions to still be in place for the mi­grant worker com­mu­nity, said Dr Tan in a Face­book post.</p>
    <p>“But they have missed the larger is­sues,” he added, not­ing that the risk of a re-emer­gence of Covid-19 among mi­grant work­ers is “real and sig­nif­i­cant”.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan said that while 47 per cent of mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries had been in­fected with</p>
    <p>Covid-19 in the past, more than half have not and re­main vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>To min­imise their risk of in­fec­tion, the Gov­ern­ment has been build­ing new dor­mi­to­ries with im­proved safety stan­dards, and mi­grant work­ers have started mov­ing into some of them since Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>The aver­age oc­cu­pancy rates in ex­ist­ing dor­mi­to­ries have also fallen to about 60 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers will also re­ceive the Covid-19 vac­cine at no cost, said Dr Tan.</p>
    <p>At the same time, other mea­sures such as rou­tine test­ing ev­ery 14 days and the use of con­tact-trac­ing de­vices must re­main in place so that new cases can be iden­ti­fied and iso­lated quickly, he said.</p>
    <p>He added that where pos­si­ble, re­stric­tions have been re­laxed to al­low those stay­ing in some dor­mi­to­ries to use com­mu­nal fa­cil­i­ties, such as the kitchen, gyms and bas­ket­ball courts.</p>
    <p>Start­ing from the first quar­ter of next year, a pi­lot scheme will al­low mi­grant work­ers to re­turn to the com­mu­nity grad­u­ally.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan said the Gov­ern­ment recog­nises its re­spon­si­bil­ity to keep Sin­ga­pore’s mi­grant work­ers safe, and to take care of their liveli­hoods and wel­fare. “Few coun­tries have done as much for their mi­grant work­ers as we have. We pro­vided them with the same stan­dard of med­i­cal care (that) Sin­ga­pore­ans en­joy, at no cost to them.”</p>
    <p>He noted that de­spite the scale of the out­break in the dor­mi­to­ries, only 25 work­ers have been ad­mit­ted to the in­ten­sive care unit and two work­ers died of Covid-19-re­lated causes.</p>
    <p>Meals, en­ter­tain­ment and coun­selling ser­vices were also pro­vided, and the Gov­ern­ment en­sured that mi­grant work­ers were paid their wages, he said.</p>
    <p>“All this took a mas­sive com­bined ef­fort, with the Gov­ern­ment work­ing with health­care work­ers, NGOs, char­i­ties and com­mu­nity groups,” said Dr Tan.</p>
    <p>“Some say we have been slow to re­lax our strin­gent mea­sures. But the most im­por­tant thing we can do for our mi­grant work­ers is to stay vig­i­lant and make sure their sac­ri­fices are not in vain.”</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Dr Tan and Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo met mi­grant work­ers at Teru­san Recre­ation Cen­tre in Jurong to mark In­ter­na­tional Mi­grants Day.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo thanked mi­grant work</p>
    <p>ers for the ad­just­ments they had to make in the fight against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>She said: “One en­cour­ag­ing de­vel­op­ment, I think, is that many more</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans are aware and ap­pre­cia­tive of our mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>“I hope that in 2021 and be­yond, this aware­ness and ap­pre­ci­a­tion of</p>
    <p>our mi­grant work­ers can con­tinue and grow stronger.”</p>
