    <p>JAN­UARY JONES’ A FAN OF CRASH LAND­ING ON YOU: Sev­eral Asian celebri­ties are known to be fans of the hit South Korean drama Crash Land­ing On You, which starred Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin.</p>
    <p>The show, which ended its run in Fe­bru­ary, was one of the high­est-rated dra­mas in South Korean ca­ble tele­vi­sion his­tory.</p>
    <p>The fever has not sub­sided and even spread to Hol­ly­wood, and ac­tress Jan­uary Jones seems to have caught the bug.</p>
    <p>Jones, 42, wrote on In­sta­gram last week that Crash Land­ing On You was her “new favourite binge” and that she loved the two lead­ing char­ac­ters.</p>
    <p>She also posted a photo of Ri Jeong Hyuk, the North Korean sol­dier played by Hyun. She wrote: “Never been in love with a man or show more.”</p>
    <p>The ac­tress, who is known for play­ing Emma Frost in the su­per­hero film X-Men: First Class (2011) and Betty Draper in the TV se­ries Mad Men (2007 to 2015), took things fur­ther over the week­end. She posted a photo (right) of her­self dress­ing up like Yoon Se-ri (left), the South Korean heiress played by Son.</p>
    <p>Jones wrote: “I bought this coat be­cause I couldn’t not have a me­mento from my favourite show of all time. It makes me cry to have it on my back. I love you Se-ri and Cap­tain Ri.”</p>
