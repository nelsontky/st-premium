    <p>The main con­cern in Viet­nam is China’s claims in the South China Sea. China’s U-shaped “nine-dash line” on its maps marks a vast ex­panse of the sea it claims, in­clud­ing swathes of Viet­nam’s con­ti­nen­tal shelf where it has awarded oil con­ces­sions and where Chi­nese and Viet­namese ships have in re­cent years been em­broiled in months-long stand-offs.</p>
    <p>• US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo wound up a visit to Asia in Viet­nam yes­ter­day af­ter a tour marked by his re­peated calls for help for the US in con­fronting se­cu­rity threats posed by China.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam, which also shares con­cern about an i ncreas­ingly as­sertive China, was a late ad­di­tion to the trip that in­cluded Sri Lanka, In­dia, the Maldives and In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>“We look for­ward to con­tin­u­ing to work to­gether to build on our re­la­tion­ship and to make the re­gion</p>
    <p>– through­out South-east Asia, Asia and the Indo-Pa­cific – safe and peace­ful and pros­per­ous,” said Mr Pom­peo, who greeted Viet­namese Prime Min­is­ter Nguyen Xuan Phuc with an el­bow bump be­fore their meet­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Phuc said he sought “sin­cere co­op­er­a­tion” in sup­port of a peace­ful re­gion and progress in trade and in­vest­ment ties.</p>
    <p>While there was no pub­lic men­tion of China yes­ter­day, Mr Pom­peo has urged South-east Asian coun­tries to stand up to its bul­ly­ing and re­assess busi­ness deals with its state firms.</p>
    <p>In Sri Lanka on Wed­nes­day, he said the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party was op­er­at­ing as a “preda­tor”.</p>
    <p>In In­dia the day be­fore, he called for co­op­er­a­tion in con­fronting what he called Chi­nese threats to se­cu­rity and free­dom in the re­gion. China has said the United States should stop its un­pro­voked ac­cu­sa­tions and at­tacks.</p>
    <p>The main con­cern in Viet­nam is China’s claims in the South China Sea. China’s U-shaped “nine-dash line” on its maps marks a vast ex­panse of the sea it claims, in­clud­ing swathes of Viet­nam’s con­ti­nen­tal shelf where it has awarded oil con­ces­sions and where Chi­nese and Viet­namese ships have in re­cent years been em­broiled in months-long stand-offs.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo’s trip came as Viet­nam and the US marked the 25th an­niver­sary of the nor­mal­is­ing of di­plo­matic ties.</p>
    <p>It also came a week af­ter Hanoi re­leased a Viet­namese-born US ci­ti­zen sen­tenced to 12 years in jail for “at­tempt­ing to over­throw the state”.</p>
    <p>Hours be­fore Mr Pom­peo’s ar­rival, Viet­nam’s for­eign min­istry re­leased a state­ment say­ing the man, Michael Nguyen, who re­turned to his home in Cal­i­for­nia last week, was re­leased for hu­man­i­tar­ian rea­sons.</p>
    <p>The state­ment made no ref­er­ence to his ac­count of his ar­rest and in­ter­ro­ga­tion, in­clud­ing his claim in a news con­fer­ence on Wed­nes­day that he had been kid­napped.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo also met Viet­nam’s Min­is­ter of Pub­lic Se­cu­rity To Lam, whose of­fice is in charge of track­ing dis­si­dents in the com­mu­nist-ruled coun­try.</p>
    <p>Bit­ter en­e­mies dur­ing the Viet­nam War in the 1960s and early 1970s, Hanoi and Wash­ing­ton have en­joyed sig­nif­i­cantly warmer re­la­tions in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>But there have been some trade ten­sions of late, with the US Trade Rep­re­sen­ta­tive con­firm­ing in Au­gust that it was in­ves­ti­gat­ing whether Viet­nam had been un­der­valu­ing its dong cur­rency and harm­ing US com­merce.</p>
    <p>Mr Phuc this week called on Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump to have “a more ob­jec­tive as­sess­ment of the re­al­ity in Viet­nam” with re­gard to the trade im­bal­ance.</p>

While ties be&#xAD;tween the two coun&#xAD;tries, once bit&#xAD;ter en&#xAD;e&#xAD;mies, have im&#xAD;proved sig&#xAD;nif&#xAD;i&#xAD;cantly over the years, some trade ten&#xAD;sions have sur&#xAD;faced re&#xAD;cently, with the US prob&#xAD;ing whether Viet&#xAD;nam has been un&#xAD;der&#xAD;valu&#xAD;ing its dong cur&#xAD;rency.</p>
