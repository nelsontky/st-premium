    <p>• Dutch air­line KLM said yes­ter­day that it would shed up to 5,000 jobs due to a “cri­sis of un­prece­dented mag­ni­tude” caused by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The car­rier, part of the Air France KLM group, said the cuts un­til the end of next year were nec­es­sary as it had made huge losses de­spite a €3.4 bil­lion (S$5.5 bil­lion) Dutch gov­ern­ment bailout.</p>
    <p>The cuts would in­volve around 1,500 com­pul­sory lay­offs f rom KLM’s cur­rent work­force of 33,000, the air­line said.</p>
    <p>There would also be 2,000 vol­un­tary re­dun­dan­cies, an­nounced ear­lier this year, while fur­ther cuts would be made through non-re­newal of 1,500 tem­po­rary con­tracts. “KLM is in the throes of a cri­sis of un­prece­dented mag­ni­tude... Expectatio­ns are that the road to re­cov­ery will be long and fraught with un­cer­tainty,” the air­line said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“This means that KLM’s struc­ture and size must be rig­or­ously ad­justed even fur­ther in the years ahead.</p>
    <p>“Con­se­quently, a to­tal of 4,500 to 5,000 po­si­tions in the en­tire KLM group will cease to ex­ist.”</p>
    <p>The jobs lost would in­volve up to 300 flight crew, 300 cabin crew, 500 ground staff and around 400 jobs at KLM sub­sidiaries and in the Air France-KLM group po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>KLM said it would “keep open the pos­si­bil­ity of fur­ther re­duc­tions” due to the “high level of un­cer­tainty” in the air­line busi­ness due to the pan­demic, with de­mand not ex­pected to re­cover un­til 2023 or 2024.</p>
    <p>“It is in­cred­i­bly dif­fi­cult and sad for KLM to now have to bid farewell to valu­able, com­mit­ted col­leagues,” KLM chief ex­ec­u­tive Pi­eter El­bers said in the state­ment.</p>
    <p>KLM on Thurs­day re­ported an un­prece­dented €768 mil­lion loss for the first half of this year, with pas­sen­ger num­bers fall­ing 95 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter – from nine mil­lion to less than half a mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, air­line con­glom­er­ate IAG, the owner of Bri­tish Air­ways, posted a first-half net loss of €3.8 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The group, which had posted a year-ear­lier net profit of €806 mil­lion, also un­veiled plans for a cap­i­tal in­crease of up to €2.75 bil­lion in a re­sults state­ment, as it seeks to nav­i­gate the fall­out from the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>IAG, which also owns Ibe­ria and Vuel­ing, swung to a pre-tax loss of €4.2 bil­lion. Rev­enues tanked 56 per cent to €5.3 bil­lion in the re­port­ing pe­riod.</p>
