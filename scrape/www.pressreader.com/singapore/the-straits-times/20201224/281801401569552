    <p>WILM­ING­TON (Delaware) • United States Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Biden has called Congress’ ap­proval of a hard-fought US$900 bil­lion (S$1.2 tril­lion) stim­u­lus pack­age a “down pay­ment” and vowed to en­ter of­fice next month ask­ing law­mak­ers to re­turn to the ne­go­ti­at­ing ta­ble.</p>
    <p>“Congress did its job this week,” he said on Tues­day, “and I can and I must ask them to do it again next year.”</p>
    <p>In a year-end news con­fer­ence in Wilm­ing­ton, Delaware, Mr Biden re­mained vague about the specifics of his plan.</p>
    <p>But he ap­peared to be lay­ing the ground­work for how he will han­dle the coun­try’s eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>He said that his Bill would in­clude a new round of stim­u­lus cheques for Amer­i­cans, but that the amount of money they con­tained would be a mat­ter of ne­go­ti­a­tion.</p>
    <p>His fo­cus, he said, was to have the money nec­es­sary to dis­trib­ute vac­cines to 300 mil­lion peo­ple, to sup­port Amer­i­cans who have lost jobs be­cause of the pan­demic, and to help busi­nesses stay open.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Biden: “Peo­ple are des­per­ately hurt­ing.”</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump also re­sponded to the Bill on Tues­day, hours af­ter Mr Biden’s news con­fer­ence. In a video he posted on Twit­ter, Mr Trump read from a pre­pared state­ment and com­plained about the leg­is­la­tion his ad­vis­ers had said he would sign.</p>
    <p>“I’m ask­ing Congress to amend this Bill and in­crease the ridicu­lously low US$600 to US$2,000, or US$4,000 for a cou­ple,” he said, call­ing the Bill “a dis­grace”.</p>
    <p>“It’s called the Covid relief Bill, but it has al­most noth­ing to do with Covid,” Mr Trump said, not­ing that it in­cluded fund­ing for the Egyp­tian mil­i­tary and money for coun­tries like Hon­duras and Nicaragua.</p>
    <p>If Mr Trump chooses not to im­me­di­ately sign the Bill, the gov­ern­ment will still be funded through Mon­day, and Repub­li­cans have enough votes that they could over­ride a po­ten­tial veto. But the cheques that Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steven Mnuchin had said would go out next week could be de­layed.</p>
    <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi quickly seized on Mr Trump’s call for US$2,000 in in­di­vid­ual stim­u­lus pay­ments and said the House would try to pass this ad­di­tional mea­sure dur­ing a pro forma ses­sion to­day, a move that could be blocked by a sin­gle mem­ber of Congress.</p>
