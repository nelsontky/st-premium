    <p>CHICAGO • The United States, which re­ported its first known coro­n­avirus case in Wash­ing­ton state 282 days ago, has sur­passed nine mil­lion to­tal in­fec­tions, in­clud­ing more than half a mil­lion in the past week, as Covid-19 spi­rals out of con­trol in the lead-up to elec­tion day.</p>
    <p>Across the coun­try, alarm­ing signs sug­gested the worst was yet to come: The na­tion re­ported more cases on Thurs­day – at l east 86,600 – than on any other sin­gle day.</p>
    <p>With the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion days away, the coun­try is now av­er­ag­ing more than 75,000 new cases daily, the worst stretch of the pan­demic by that mea­sure.</p>
    <p>Deaths, which lag be­hind cases, re­main far be­low their spring lev­els, but have ticked up­wards to about 780 each day.</p>
    <p>More cases have been iden­ti­fied in the US than in any other coun­try, though some na­tions have higher per capita in­fec­tion rates.</p>
    <p>The White House coro­n­avirus task force on Thurs­day warned of a per­sis­tent and broad spread of Covid-19 in the western half of the coun­try, and its mem­bers urged ag­gres­sive mea­sures to curb the surge in in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The hard­est-hit ar­eas in­clude a num­ber of bat­tle­ground states that will play an im­por­tant role in Tues­day’s US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion as Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump seeks a sec­ond term against Demo­cratic chal­lenger Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>“We are on a very dif­fi­cult tra­jec­tory. We’re go­ing in the wrong di­rec­tion,” said Dr An­thony Fauci, task force mem­ber and di­rec­tor of the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Al­lergy and In­fec­tious Diseases.</p>
    <p>“If things do not change, if they con­tinue on the course we’re on, there’s gonna be a whole lot of pain in this coun­try with re­gard to ad­di­tional cases and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions, and deaths,” Dr Fauci said in an in­ter­view with news net­work CNBC on Wed­nes­day night.</p>
    <p>He in­di­cated that the first doses of a coro­n­avirus vac­cine might be­come avail­able to some high-risk Amer­i­cans in late De­cem­ber or early Jan­uary, if all goes well.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a string of prom­i­nent pub­lic health ex­perts – no­tably Dr Fauci and Dr Scott Got­tlieb, a for­mer com­mis­sioner of the Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion un­der Pres­i­dent Trump – have said it is time to se­ri­ously con­sider a na­tional man­date to curb the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>Over­seas this week, Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin be­came the lat­est for­eign leader to im­pose a na­tional man­date for cit­i­zens to wear masks.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump is op­posed to a man­date, and Mr Bi­den has con­ceded that a pres­i­den­tial or­der for all Amer­i­cans to wear masks would al­most cer­tainly face – and most likely fall to – a le­gal chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic health and le­gal ex­perts say it would be far bet­ter for Mr Bi­den – or Mr Trump, for that mat­ter – to use his pow­ers of per­sua­sion to con­vince Amer­i­cans that cover­ing one’s face to curb the spread of the virus is a pa­tri­otic or civic-minded ac­tion.</p>
    <p>But some pub­lic health ex­perts fear that Mr Trump – who rou­tinely mocks Mr Bi­den for wear­ing a mask and whose aides of­ten forgo them even as the White House has be­come its own coro­n­avirus hot spot – has so poi­soned the dis­cus­sion around masks that wear­ing them will al­ways be con­strued as a po­lit­i­cal state­ment.</p>
    <p>DAN­GER­OUS TREND</p>
    <p>We are on a very dif­fi­cult tra­jec­tory. We’re go­ing in the wrong di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>DR AN­THONY FAUCI, White House coro­n­avirus task force mem­ber and di­rec­tor of the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Al­lergy and In­fec­tious Diseases.</p>
