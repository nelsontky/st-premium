    <p>LON­DON • A court al­lowed a Bri­tish news­pa­per group on Tues­day to amend its de­fence against a high-pro­file claim by Meghan Markle for breach of pri­vacy and copy­right. The for­mer tele­vi­sion ac­tress is su­ing As­so­ci­ated News­pa­pers over its pub­li­ca­tion of ex­tracts of a let­ter she wrote to her es­tranged fa­ther be­fore her wed­ding to Prince Harry in 2018.</p>
    <p>At a High Court hear­ing in Lon­don last week, her lawyers tried to block an ap­pli­ca­tion to state that the cou­ple co­op­er­ated on a re­cent book about their lives to­gether. The pair, who quit front­line royal du­ties ear­lier this year cit­ing me­dia in­tru­sion, de­nied they were in­volved in the pub­li­ca­tion of Find­ing Free­dom in any way.</p>
    <p>But As­so­ci­ated, which pub­lishes the Mail on Sun­day and the Mail On­line web­site, ar­gued the book had “ev­ery ap­pear­ance of hav­ing been writ­ten with their ex­ten­sive co­op­er­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, it al­leged Meghan, 39, gave the au­thors Omid Sco­bie and Carolyn Du­rand de­tails about the let­ter to por­tray her ver­sion of events i n a more favourable light. It also claimed Meghan wanted to use the hand­writ­ten let­ter “as part of a me­dia strat­egy” and dis­cussed it with royal com­mu­ni­ca­tions of­fi­cials be­fore it was sent.</p>
    <p>In a rul­ing, Judge Francesca Kaye al­lowed the amend­ment to As­so­ci­ated’s de­fence de­spite Meghan’s lawyers ar­gu­ing that the de­fence had “no merit and is in fact false”.</p>
    <p>Sco­bie has said in a wit­ness state­ment that nei­ther Meghan nor Harry col­lab­o­rated on the bi­og­ra­phy. “They did not au­tho­rise the book and have never been in­ter­viewed for it,” he added.</p>
    <p>A 10-day trial is set to take place in Jan­uary. Win or lose, it will be seen as a key mo­ment in the cou­ple’s in­creas­ingly bit­ter war with the Bri­tish tabloid press.</p>
    <p>Harry, 36, has sep­a­rately brought cases against News Group News­pa­pers and Mir­ror Group News­pa­pers over al­leged phone hack­ing in the past.</p>
    <p>Meghan is also tak­ing ac­tion against a pic­ture agency af­ter she and young son Archie were pho­tographed in a Cana­dian park ear­lier this year.</p>
