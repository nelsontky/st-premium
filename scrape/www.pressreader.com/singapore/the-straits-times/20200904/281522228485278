    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and his fam­ily tested pos­i­tive for coro­n­avirus but have made a full re­cov­ery, the pro­fes­sional wrestler turned Hol­ly­wood A-lis­ter said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Johnson, the world’s high­est-paid ac­tor, urged his 196 mil­lion In­sta­gram fol­low­ers to wear masks and avoid “politi­cis­ing” the pan­demic af­ter re­veal­ing that he, his wife and two young daugh­ters had caught Covid-19 from close fam­ily friends.</p>
    <p>“This has been one of the most chal­leng­ing and dif­fi­cult things we have ever had to en­dure as a fam­ily,” said Johnson. “I wish it was only me who tested pos­i­tive. But it wasn’t – it was my en­tire fam­ily, so this one was a real kick in the gut.”</p>
    <p>The 48-year-old Ju­manji ac­tor’s young chil­dren Jas­mine and Tiana Gia, who are four and two years old re­spec­tively, had few symp­toms, but Johnson said he and his wife Lau­ren Hashian, 35, “had a rough go”.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has brought Hol­ly­wood to a vir­tual stand­still, with movie pro­duc­tions only re­cently restart­ing in Los An­ge­les un­der strict con­di­tions and with skele­ton crews.</p>
    <p>Af­ter ini­tially be­ing praised for its re­sponse to the dis­ease, Cal­i­for­nia has suf­fered more cases than any state in the United States – more than 700,000 – and was hit with a record num­ber of deaths last month.</p>
    <p>Other stars, such as Tom Hanks, An­to­nio Ban­deras and Idris Elba, have tested pos­i­tive for the ill­ness but re­cov­ered fully.</p>
    <p>“We are count­ing our bless­ings right now be­cause we’re well aware that it isn’t al­ways the case that you get on the other end of Covid-19 stronger and health­ier,” said Johnson.</p>
    <p>He added: “It baf­fles me that some peo­ple out there – in­clud­ing some politi­cians – will take this idea of wear­ing masks and make it part of a po­lit­i­cal agenda, politi­cis­ing it.</p>
    <p>“It has noth­ing to do with pol­i­tics. Wear your mask. It is a fact. And it is the right thing to do.”</p>
