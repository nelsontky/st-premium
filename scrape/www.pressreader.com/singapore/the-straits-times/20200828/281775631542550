    <p>Twenty-seven em­ploy­ees will be laid off in a re­trench­ment ex­er­cise at Boe­ing Asia Pa­cific Avi­a­tion Ser­vices (Ba­pas), a joint ven­ture be­tween The Boe­ing Com­pany and SIA En­gi­neer­ing Com­pany.</p>
    <p>The af­fected staff, who will be no­ti­fied today, in­clude en­gi­neers and pro­fes­sion­als from dif­fer­ent func­tions across Ba­pas.</p>
    <p>They make up about 13 per cent of the 204-strong work­force at Ba­pas, which pro­vides fleet man­age­ment ser­vices for Boe­ing air­craft.</p>
    <p>In a joint state­ment with the Sin­ga­pore In­dus­trial and Ser­vices Em­ploy­ees’ Union (SISEU) yes­ter­day, Ba­pas said SISEU was no­ti­fied in ad­vance of the re­trench­ment ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>The avi­a­tion sec­tor is one of the hard­est hit by the economic fall­out from the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The com­pany said mea­sures were taken at the start of the pan­demic to man­age costs and save jobs, but it is fac­ing “sig­nif­i­cant fi­nan­cial chal­lenges” due to the economic down­turn and the per­sis­tent ef­fects of the pan­demic on the avi­a­tion in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>It said re­trench­ment was taken as a last re­sort, af­ter ex­haust­ing all other cost-sav­ing op­tions.</p>
    <p>Ba­pas chief ex­ec­u­tive Alvey Pratt said the cost-cut­ting mea­sures in­cluded ad­just­ing the com­pany’s op­er­a­tions com­men­su­rate with the re­duced demand for their ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“The essence of Ba­pas is our em­ploy­ees, which makes this de­ci­sion, while nec­es­sary, par­tic­u­larly dif­fi­cult,” he said. “Our pri­or­i­ties will still be to work closely with our em­ploy­ees, cus­tomers and sup­pli­ers go­ing for­ward to col­lec­tively over­come the chal­lenges pre­sented by Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany added that it has worked with SISEU to ex­tend fair com­pen­sa­tion terms and em­ploy­ment-re­lated as­sis­tance to the af­fected staff.</p>
    <p>SISEU and Na­tional Trades Union Congress’ Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute are also work­ing to pro­vide job-match­ing and train­ing sup­port to the work­ers, the joint state­ment said.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times, a spokesman for Ba­pas said prior to the re­trench­ment ex­er­cise, 79 per cent of its work­force were Sin­ga­pore­ans. Af­ter the ex­er­cise, 82 per cent will com­prise Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>“If Ba­pas were to in­clude the num­ber of per­ma­nent res­i­dents, the per­cent­ages will change to 91 per cent and 93 per cent re­spec­tively,” the spokesman added.</p>
