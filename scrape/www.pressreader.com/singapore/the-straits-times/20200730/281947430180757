    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steve Mnuchin yes­ter­day said so­cial me­dia app TikTok is un­der fed­eral gov­ern­ment re­view and a rec­om­men­da­tion will be made to Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump on it.</p>
    <p>The Com­mit­tee on For­eign In­vest­ment in the United States, which re­views deals by for­eign ac­quir­ers for po­ten­tial na­tional se­cu­rity risks, is look­ing at TikTok, said Mr Mnuchin.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump said be­fore leav­ing the White House on a trip to Texas that they are think­ing about a de­ci­sion on the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Both Mr Trump and Mr Mnuchin’s state­ments come af­ter a group of top Repub­li­can US sen­a­tors asked the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion to as­sess the threat that the pop­u­lar Chi­ne­se­owned video-shar­ing app might be used to med­dle in the US elec­tion.</p>
    <p>In a let­ter on Tues­day, Mr Marco Ru­bio, Mr Tom Cot­ton and other law­mak­ers cited al­leged cen­sor­ship by TikTok of sen­si­tive con­tent, in­clud­ing a video crit­i­cal of China’s treat­ment of Uighur mi­nori­ties, as well as al­leged at­tempts by Bei­jing to ma­nip­u­late po­lit­i­cal dis­cus­sions on so­cial me­dia apps.</p>
    <p>“We are greatly con­cerned that the (Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party) could use its con­trol over TikTok to dis­tort or ma­nip­u­late (po­lit­i­cal) con­ver­sa­tions to sow dis­cord among Amer­i­cans and to achieve its pre­ferred po­lit­i­cal out­comes,” the law­mak­ers wrote in a let­ter to the Of­fice of Di­rec­tor of Na­tional In­tel­li­gence, the act­ing sec­re­tary of the De­part­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity and the di­rec­tor of the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for TikTok said the com­pany, though not a “go-to” for po­lit­i­cal news, was “proac­tively in­vest­ing to safe­guard our app”, and tak­ing cues from the ex­pe­ri­ence of peers dur­ing the last elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“TikTok al­ready has a strict pol­icy against dis­in­for­ma­tion, and we don’t ac­cept po­lit­i­cal ads,” said the spokesman, adding that con­tent and mod­er­a­tion poli­cies are led by a Cal­i­for­nia-based team and are not “in­flu­enced by any for­eign gov­ern­ment”.</p>
