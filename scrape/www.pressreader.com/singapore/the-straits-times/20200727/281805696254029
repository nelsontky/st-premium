    <p>JAKARTA • The In­done­sian Tele­vi­sion Jour­nal­ists As­so­ci­a­tion (IJTI) has es­tab­lished a special task force to help curb the spread of Covid-19 among me­dia work­ers af­ter at least 96 jour­nal­ists and elec­tronic me­dia work­ers con­tracted the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>IJTI chair­man Yadi Hen­dri­ana said the task force’s main duty was to com­pile a list of jour­nal­ists who are in­fected with the coronaviru­s.</p>
    <p>He urged jour­nal­ists who might have been ex­posed to the virus to fill out an on­line form pro­vided by the or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“The IJTI will pay the cost of PCR test­ing for TV j our­nal­ists who do not re­ceive such (test­ing) from their re­spec­tive com­pa­nies,” Mr Yadi said last Fri­day as re­ported by Kom­pas TV.</p>
    <p>He also asked me­dia com­pa­nies to pri­ori­tise the safety of their jour­nal­ists by im­ple­ment­ing strict health pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>The Al­liance of In­de­pen­dent Jour­nal­ists (AJI) said sep­a­rately that me­dia firms were obliged to pro­tect the health of their work­ers, as stip­u­lated in Ar­ti­cle 86 of the 2003 Man­power Law.</p>
    <p>“The la w states that ev­ery worker has the right to health pro­tec­tion,” AJI chair­man Ab­dul Manan said sep­a­rately last Thurs­day, as re­ported by Kom­pas TV.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ous re­ports re­vealed that over 50 jour­nal­ists in Surabaya, the cap­i­tal of East Java prov­ince, had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, with three suc­cumb­ing to the dis­ease, as the re­gion emerged as a new epi­cen­tre of the coronaviru­s out­break in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>AJI Surabaya pre­vi­ously said re­porters’ fail­ure to fol­low health pro­to­cols and me­dia firms’ re­luc­tance to pro­tect the health of their em­ploy­ees were among the con­tribut­ing fac­tors to the spread of the virus among me­dia work­ers.</p>
