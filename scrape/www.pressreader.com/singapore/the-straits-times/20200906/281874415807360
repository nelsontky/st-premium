    <p>With fewer than 60 days to the</p>
    <p>Nov 3 elec­tion and early vot­ing al­ready started in North Carolina, the ri­vals for the White House lashed out at each other with a new fe­roc­ity ig­nited by al­le­ga­tions in an ar­ti­cle that Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump was dis­re­spect­ful about the sac­ri­fices of Amer­i­can mil­i­tary per­son­nel – and par­tic­u­larly those buried at the site of the 1918 Bat­tle of Bel­leau Wood in France.</p>
    <p>The ar­ti­cle, pub­lished in the largely well-re­spected mag­a­zine</p>
    <p>The At­lantic, landed like a grenade in the mid­dle of the tight­en­ing pres­i­den­tial race – and it prob­a­bly will not be the last such mis­sile in the weeks ahead.</p>
    <p>It cited mul­ti­ple sources – but all un­named – say­ing Pres­i­dent Trump called those buried at the Aisne-Marne Amer­i­can Ceme­tery some 80km from Paris “suck­ers” and “losers”.</p>
    <p>Eleven for­mer and cur­rent White House of­fi­cials have come out to say the al­le­ga­tions in the ar­ti­cle are not true.</p>
    <p>“It’s a hoax,” Pres­i­dent Trump him­self said at a late Fri­day af­ter­noon press con­fer­ence. “It’s a shame.”</p>
    <p>But sep­a­rately, Ms Jen­nifer Grif­fin, na­tional se­cu­rity cor­re­spon­dent for Fox News, re­ported that two for­mer ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials had con­firmed key de­tails in the At­lantic ar­ti­cle.</p>
    <p>The wild­fire ig­nited by the ar­ti­cle – that was only the most ex­treme of sev­eral in­stances men­tioned in it – has thrown into sharp re­lief a key asym­me­try of the cam­paign for the White House.</p>
    <p>There are core is­sues that af­fect ev­ery Amer­i­can – health­care, taxes, law and or­der, for in­stance – that can be ob­jec­tively an­a­lysed and ar­gued.</p>
    <p>Then there is also a deeply sub­jec­tive and emo­tional choice be­tween a Pres­i­dent who, for those who hate him, can do noth­ing right, and for those who sup­port him, can do noth­ing wrong.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s ri­val, for­mer vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den, at a brief press con­fer­ence on Fri­day, said: “If what is writ­ten in The At­lantic is true, it’s dis­gust­ing.</p>
    <p>“It af­firms what most of us be­lieve to be true: that Don­ald Trump is not fit to be com­man­der-in-chief.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den won praise across the board for an even-tem­pered ac­cep­tance speech at the Demo­cratic Na­tional Con­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>The word “de­cent” has most of­ten been used to de­scribe him. In fact, “de­cency” is what he em­pha­sises him­self in his speeches. Af­ter his ad­dress at the con­ven­tion, Wash­ing­ton Post colum­nist Michael Ger­son gushed that “Bi­den man­aged to cap­ture the ro­mance of de­cency”.</p>
    <p>In­evitably there is a fo­cus, am­pli­fied by the lib­eral me­dia, on the con­trast that Mr Trump of­fers – brusque, brash, blunt, out­ra­geous.</p>
    <p>That misses the fact that al­most ev­ery­thing he says goes down very well with his sup­port­ers, who ap­pre­ci­ate what they see as his au­then­tic­ity.</p>
    <p>In just one ex­am­ple of al­ter­na­tive re­al­i­ties, many last week tweeted and re­ported a re­mark he made at a small rally at the Arnold Palmer air­port in La­trobe, near Pitts­burgh, that the cam­paign was us­ing air­port han­gars be­cause us­ing are­nas was not pos­si­ble ow­ing to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>And he said he ac­tu­ally liked the air­port ral­lies be­cause he could just get off the plane, give a speech “and get the hell out of here”.</p>
    <p>The im­pli­ca­tion in the re­port­ing was that it was a cal­lous re­mark.</p>
    <p>But what was left out of most re­ports was the fact that the crowd was not in the least of­fended.</p>
    <p>They thor­oughly en­joyed his speech and laughed aloud at the re­mark.</p>
    <p>Cer­tainly the At­lantic ar­ti­cle has hit a nerve.</p>
    <p>At Bel­leau Wood, ca­su­al­ties on all sides – Amer­i­can, Bri­tish, French and Ger­man – were hor­rific as they fought one another with mor­tars, ma­chine guns, mus­tard gas and bay­o­nets.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­cans pre­vailed but out of a com­ple­ment of 9,500 men, the Fourth Marine Brigade alone recorded 1,000 killed in ac­tion, and 4,000 wounded, gassed or miss­ing.</p>
    <p>Thus, Bel­leau Wood is hal­lowed ground for a US Marine, ev­ery one of whom knows the fa­mous quote at­trib­uted to Cap­tain Lloyd Wil­liams when told to re­treat: “Re­treat, hell we just got here!”</p>
    <p>Part of the rea­son the At­lantic ar­ti­cle rings true to many is that in 2015, Pres­i­dent Trump, in ref­er­ence to se­na­tor John McCain, a for­mer naval pi­lot shot down in Viet­nam and in­car­cer­ated in the no­to­ri­ous prison nick­named the Hanoi Hil­ton, said: “I like peo­ple who weren’t cap­tured.” Se­na­tor McCain died in 2018.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, Mr Trump tried to nu­ance it, say­ing he had had his dis­agree­ments with Mr McCain but that did not mean he had not re­spected him as well. And he and his sur­ro­gates con­tin­ued to chal­lenge The At­lantic to name its sources.</p>
    <p>Whether this episode is a pass­ing storm or will move the nee­dle of pub­lic opin­ion re­mains to be seen.</p>
    <p>But for now at least, it is doubt­ful that it will go be­yond just con­firm­ing and deep­en­ing the worst loathings of Democrats and so-called “never-Trumpers” to budge his core sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>“If all the anony­mous sources from @TheAt­lantic piece de­cide to pub­licly go on record with Trump’s call­ing war dead “losers” and “suck­ers”, it won’t make a bit of dif­fer­ence to his ap­proval rat­ings,” tweeted Dr Ian Brem­mer, pres­i­dent and founder of po­lit­i­cal risk con­sul­tancy Eura­sia Group.</p>
