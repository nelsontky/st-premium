    <p>Asean and the Euro­pean Union have long been friends and part­ners. The vir­tual 23rd Asean-EU Min­is­te­rial Meet­ing on Tues­day has fi­nally de­clared they are also strate­gic part­ners.</p>
    <p>The up­grade of the di­a­logue part­ner­ship to strate­gic part­ner­ship is good news.</p>
    <p>Chang­ing geopol­i­tics, the need for quick ac­tion to en­sure a global eco­nomic re­cov­ery, pre­vent fu­ture pan­demics and com­bat cli­mate change are just some of the com­pelling rea­sons re­quir­ing a stronger strate­gic con­ver­sa­tion be­tween the two re­gions.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion has been a long time in the mak­ing. An EU pol­icy paper is­sued five years ago clearly stated that the EU had “a strate­gic in­ter­est” in strength­en­ing its re­la­tion­ship with Asean in view of com­bined high rates of eco­nomic growth and its place “at the heart of ef­forts to build a more ro­bust re­gional se­cu­rity or­der”.</p>
    <p>But twists and turns in the re­la­tion­ship, in­clud­ing Malaysian and In­done­sian con­cerns over the treat­ment of their palm oil ex­ports to the EU, got in the way.</p>
    <p>In the end, how­ever, the tim­ing is per­fect to up­grade this to a strate­gic part­ner­ship to re­flect the cen­tral­ity of Asean and the strate­gic au­ton­omy of the EU.</p>
    <p>COM­PET­ING FOR AT­TEN­TION</p>
    <p>As United States Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den seeks to re­pair the er­ratic for­eign pol­icy ap­proaches of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, and has pledged a re­turn to diplo­macy and at­ten­tion to both Europe and Asia, there is al­ways the dan­ger that the part­ner­ship will be over­shad­owed.</p>
    <p>In­deed, for the EU, Amer­ica’s re­turn to South-east Asia will mean more com­pe­ti­tion for at­ten­tion. When Washington was ei­ther blun­der­ing or miss­ing in ac­tion in South-east Asia in the past few years, it was rel­a­tively easy for Brus­sels and other Euro­pean cap­i­tals to get their share of the lime­light.</p>
    <p>A sur­vey this year by the ISEAS – Yu­sof Ishak In­sti­tute showed that the EU came out tops as an or­gan­i­sa­tion that can be trusted to pro­vide global lead­er­ship to up­hold in­ter­na­tional law and rules-based or­der. Also in the same sur­vey, the EU, at 31.7 per cent, was sec­ond only to Ja­pan (38.2 per cent) in be­ing the most pre­ferred trusted and strate­gic part­ner for Asean to broaden its strate­gic op­tions in hedg­ing against US-China ri­valry.</p>
    <p>Asean also ben­e­fited from the EU’s height­ened in­ter­est in craft­ing a “be­yond China” Asia pol­icy which in­cluded forg­ing stronger part­ner­ships with</p>
    <p>Asean as well as with Ja­pan and In­dia.</p>
    <p>Both have been shaken by the “Amer­ica First” doc­trine pur­sued by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion and the in­creas­ing strate­gic com­pe­ti­tion be­tween China and the US which up­ended the post-Cold War or­der. While the elec­tion of Mr Bi­den may mit­i­gate some of the ten­sions and see the US seek­ing to ex­ert its lead­er­ship again in mul­ti­lat­eral set­tings, it is clear that the world has changed dra­mat­i­cally in the last few years.</p>
    <p>The US is no longer the hege­mon with over­whelm­ing hard and soft power. The world has be­come too com­plex and with too many mov­ing parts to rely on any one leader. In fact, the global stage is marked by asym­met­ri­cal mul­ti­po­lar­ity with hy­per­con­nec­tiv­ity and many more ac­tors – some con­struc­tive, oth­ers de­struc­tive – vy­ing for in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>The dis­rup­tions un­leashed by the Covid-19 pan­demic have ex­ac­er­bated many ex­ist­ing trends and ten­sions.</p>
    <p>In geopol­i­tics, even with the re­turn of Mr Bi­den and the prom­ise of diplo­macy and ex­per­tise in for­eign poli­cies, US lead­er­ship will be chal­lenged. Strate­gic com­pe­ti­tion be­tween the US and China will re­main.</p>
    <p>In geo-eco­nomics, na­tion­al­ism and eco­nomic pro­tec­tion­ism will re­main, and re­gion­al­i­sa­tion is likely to sup­plant glob­al­i­sa­tion as the key driv­ing force of eco­nomic devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>CON­TIN­UED REL­E­VANCE</p>
    <p>These dis­rup­tions and un­cer­tain­ties make it es­pe­cially im­por­tant that the EU and Asean have stepped up to as­sert their con­tin­ued rel­e­vance.</p>
    <p>It has been said be­fore but is worth re­peat­ing: Both Asean and the EU are suc­cess­ful re­gional or­gan­i­sa­tions with a sim­i­lar com­mit­ment to an in­clu­sive, mul­ti­lat­eral rules-based or­der. They are now also part­ners in con­nec­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Ex­am­ples of in­creased col­lab­o­ra­tion abound. At the be­gin­ning of the pan­demic, the EU and Asean met on March 20 via tele­con­fer­enc­ing to share in­for­ma­tion about out­breaks and com­mit to ac­tions and ef­forts on dis­ease con­trol and treat­ment.</p>
    <p>Since then, the EU has mo­bilised over €800 mil­lion (S$1.3 bil­lion) through the Team Europe ini­tia­tive to help the</p>
    <p>Asean re­gion cope with the Covid-19 cri­sis. Both the EU and Asean are com­mit­ted to vac­cine mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism and will work with the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion to en­sure fair, eq­ui­table and af­ford­able ac­cess to safe and ef­fec­tive vac­cines.</p>
    <p>While Asean’s “cen­tral­ity” as a se­cu­rity player in the re­gion is widely ac­knowl­edged, the suc­cess­ful con­clu­sion of the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP), which brings to­gether 15 Asian economies con­tribut­ing an an­nual US$12.4 tril­lion (S$16.6 tril­lion) to global trade – about 28 per cent of the over­all fig­ure – is per­haps the strong­est sig­nal yet of Asean’s piv­otal eco­nomic role in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>So what hap­pens next? An Asean-EU “con­nec­tiv­ity part­ner­ship” will re­in­force the two re­gions’ joint in­ter­est in work­ing to­gether to en­sure high-qual­ity en­vi­ron­men­tal norms and stan­dards for in­fra­struc­ture, dig­i­tal and en­ergy link-ups.</p>
    <p>There are hopes that the sign­ing of the RCEP last month dur­ing the Asean Sum­mit will catal­yse the relaunch of the in­ter-re­gional EU-Asean ne­go­ti­a­tions on a free trade agree­ment.</p>
    <p>Close to 90 per cent of those sur­veyed in Asean sup­port the ne­go­ti­a­tions of an EU-Asean FTA. Euro­pean busi­ness is also in favour of open­ing such talks as one way of boost­ing re­gion-to-re­gion trade and in­vest­ment flows.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the EU-Asean FTA, a Com­pre­hen­sive Air Trans­port Agree­ment (CATA) be­tween Asean and the EU, once con­cluded, will cover mar­ket ac­cess as well as ar­eas such as safety and se­cu­rity, and al­low for grad­ual reg­u­la­tory con­ver­gence. This would be strongly wel­comed at a time when the pan­demic has dev­as­tated the aviation in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, Asean in­put will be im­por­tant as the EU starts the process of defin­ing its own Indo-Pa­cific strat­egy. EU pol­i­cy­mak­ers have said they will be in­spired by Asean’s strat­egy for the Indo-Pa­cific and they will fo­cus on en­sur­ing an “in­clu­sive” Indo-Pa­cific re­gion, not one which acts to ex­clude China.</p>
    <p>EU pol­i­cy­mak­ers are also still hop­ing for Asean’s go-ahead to their long­stand­ing re­quest for a seat at the ta­ble of the East Asia Sum­mit. That nod should come sooner rather than later, so that Asean and the EU can fur­ther deepen and widen their re­la­tions on both a bi­lat­eral and mul­ti­lat­eral level.</p>
    <p>While of­ten over­looked by a world ob­sessed by great power com­pe­ti­tion and zero-sum games, Asean and the EU are proof that coun­tries with dif­fer­ent his­to­ries, ge­og­ra­phy, and po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic struc­tures can work to­gether and find com­mon ground.</p>
