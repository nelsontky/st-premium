    <p>The Na­tional In­sti­tute of Ed­u­ca­tion team has been work­ing with teach­ers to de­sign new les­son pack­ages in ar­eas that are not as well ex­plored.</p>
    <p>These in­clude top­ics such as Asian lit­er­a­ture, race and iden­tity, and us­ing drama teach­ing strate­gies in the class­room.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Suzanne Choo said these projects are part of the re­search team’s ef­fort to ex­plore new and in­no­va­tive ways of teach­ing lit­er­a­ture, and get stu­dents to ex­pe­ri­ence the sub­ject in a global con­text.</p>
    <p>Work­ing with three teach­ers from dif­fer­ent schools, the team de­vel­oped a 10-week les­son pack­age on Asian po­etry for Sec­ondary 3 stu­dents last year.</p>
    <p>“Most stu­dents are fa­mil­iar with Western forms like the son­net or the bal­lad but they’ve never heard of po­etic forms from Asia like ghazal, lan­day or twin cin­ema,” said Prof Choo.</p>
    <p>“Our sur­vey of teach­ers had also shown that not enough re­gional texts are be­ing used, com­pared to Western and Singapore texts,” she added.</p>
    <p>The stu­dents were in­tro­duced to a va­ri­ety of po­etry from Asia in English or trans­lated into English.</p>
    <p>The team worked on another project with two teach­ers this year, which was cen­tred on ex­plor­ing race and iden­tity in Singapore through lo­cal lit­er­a­ture.</p>
    <p>Sec­ondary 4 stu­dents read and an­a­lysed po­ems writ­ten by mi­nor­ity groups and dis­cussed the ef­fects of stereo­typ­ing and racism.</p>
    <p>They also wrote their own po­ems on iden­tity and what be­long­ing to Singapore means to them.</p>
    <p>Said Prof Choo: “Ac­cord­ing to the sur­vey find­ings, Singapore lit­er­a­ture is be­ing used widely but per­ti­nent is­sues like race and class that have been in the news are not be­ing probed fur­ther.”</p>
    <p>The lessons opened up “pow­er­ful con­ver­sa­tions” be­tween the stu­dents about race and how words and ac­tions can be hurt­ful, she added.</p>
