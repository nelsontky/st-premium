    <p>NEW YORK Is rid­ing an e-bike good ex­er­cise? Is rid­ing an e-bike safe?</p>
    <p>With i nter­est i n and sales of pedal-as­sisted elec­tric bikes surg­ing dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, those ques­tions share a growing ur­gency.</p>
    <p>A timely new study of e-bike rid­ers’ ex­er­tions and in­juries sug­gest that the an­swer to both ques­tions can be a qual­i­fied yes, though any­one rid­ing an e-bike needs to be aware that the ex­pe­ri­ence is cer­tainly cy­cling with a kick to it.</p>
    <p>As most of us are likely aware, bike rid­ing has be­come ex­tremely pop­u­lar and as­pi­ra­tional this year, since so many of us are oth­er­wise house­bound.</p>
    <p>Rid­ing gets us out­side, ac­tive and head­ing some­where – any­where – else. But it also in­volves dis­tance, hills, winds and some­times leaden legs, which can be daunt­ing.</p>
    <p>Enter e-bikes. Short for elec­tric bikes, these are road or moun­tain bikes with an added bat­tery-pow­ered mo­tor that boosts our ped­alling power.</p>
    <p>Given their abil­ity to help us cover mul­ti­ple kilo­me­tres with­out re­quir­ing a spousal sag wagon, ebikes sales have soared by 70 per cent or more in the US each month since the pan­demic be­gan, ac­cord­ing to in­dus­try sta­tis­tics.</p>
    <p>But this pop­u­lar­ity may carry a price.</p>
    <p>Si­mon Cow­ell, the acer­bic judge on Amer­ica’s Got Tal­ent TV show, re­ported on Twit­ter he was hos­pi­talised ear­lier this month af­ter frac­tur­ing his back dur­ing his first ride on a new elec­tric trail bike, an ex­cep­tion­ally high-pow­ered Bri­tish ver­sion of an elec­tric bi­cy­cle.</p>
    <p>Many of us have heard other (some­times apoc­ryphal) sto­ries about e-bike ac­ci­dents. And some peo­ple won­der if rid­ing an e-bike, with its pedal as­sis­tance, even counts as a work­out.</p>
    <p>On that last count, though, the first of the new stud­ies is re­as­sur­ing.</p>
    <p>Pub­lished last month in The In­ter­na­tional Jour­nal of En­vi­ron­men­tal Re­search and Pub­lic Health, it in­volved 101 healthy adult men and women in Ham­burg, Ger­many, who agreed to al­ter­nate rid­ing ei­ther a stan­dard bi­cy­cle or an e-bike over two sep­a­rate two-week pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>Each vol­un­teer chose his or her pre­ferred e-bike model, with most pick­ing road bikes hav­ing top as­sisted speeds of about 32kmh.</p>
    <p>To com­pen­sate for the nov­elty fac­tor, par­tic­i­pants spent a cou­ple of weeks get­ting used to their ebikes be­fore the study pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers also pro­vided their vol­un­teers with ac­tiv­ity mon­i­tors, heart rate mon­i­tors and a spe­cialised mo­bile app where the rid­ers could record their trips, dis­tance and how phys­i­cally drain­ing each ride had felt.</p>
    <p>The sci­en­tists did not of­fer their vol­un­teers any sug­ges­tions, how­ever, about where, when or how of­ten to ride, says Hed­wig Sten­ner, a re­search as­so­ciate at the In­sti­tute of Sports Medicine at Han­nover Med­i­cal School, who led the new study.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers wanted to see how peo­ple, on their own ini­tia­tive, would use the dif­fer­ent bikes and whether their rid­ing would change with the e-bikes.</p>
    <p>Elec­tric as­sis­tance did change their habits, the re­searchers found.</p>
    <p>In gen­eral, the men and women rode more of­ten dur­ing the two weeks with e-bikes, av­er­ag­ing about five rides a week then, ver­sus three a week with the stan­dard bi­cy­cles.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est­ingly, the dis­tances of most peo­ple’s rides did not budge, which­ever type of bike they rode; their rides were not length­ier on the e-bikes, but they were more fre­quent.</p>
    <p>Their heart rates also dif­fered. In gen­eral, peo­ple’s heart rates were about eight per cent lower when they ped­alled e-bikes, but still con­sis­tently hov­ered within the range con­sid­ered mod­er­ate ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, dur­ing the two weeks when the vol­un­teers rode e-bikes, they ac­cu­mu­lated suf­fi­cient min­utes of mod­er­ate phys­i­cal ac­tiv­ity to meet the stan­dard ex­er­cise rec­om­men­da­tion of 150 min­utes of mod­er­ate ac­tiv­ity. When they rode the stan­dard bikes, they did not.</p>
    <p>Most also re­ported lik­ing the pedal-as­sist, says Sten­ner.</p>
    <p>More than two-thirds of the par­tic­i­pants told the re­searchers they en­joyed the e-bikes and could imag­ine us­ing them “for many years”, ac­cord­ing to a fi­nal study ques­tion­naire.</p>
    <p>But whether e-bikes might pose a greater risk for in­juries than stan­dard bi­cy­cles re­mains an open ques­tion.</p>
    <p>“No se­ri­ous in­juries were re­ported to us,” dur­ing the re­search, says Sten­ner.</p>
    <p>E-bikes, at heart, are bikes, so if you can ride a bike, you can ride an e-bike.</p>
    <p>“You’ll just feel as if you have su­per­hero legs” on the am­pli­fied, elec­tric ver­sions, says Ian Kenny, the ebike brand leader for bike com­pany Spe­cialised.</p>
    <p>E-bikes boost cy­cling speeds, though, so most new rid­ers would ben­e­fit from some prac­tice spins in a pro­tected area with lit­tle traf­fic be­fore ven­tur­ing onto roads or paths, he says.</p>
    <p>Look for a large, empty carpark or a road closed to traf­fic for your first few rides.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing these shake­out ses­sions, use your bi­cy­cle’s low­est as­sis­tance set­ting, with dif­fer­ent e-bikes of­fer­ing dif­fer­ent lev­els of pedal as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>“E-bikes ac­cel­er­ate faster” than stan­dard bikes, Kenny points out, and that sud­den mo­men­tum can dis­con­cert and bob­ble un­pre­pared rid­ers.</p>
    <p>Prac­tice slow­ing and brak­ing, too. “Be­cause e-bikes are heav­ier and travel faster, they will re­quire more time and dis­tance to stop” than a stan­dard bike, he adds.</p>
    <p>When you do head for the open roads or paths, re­mem­ber to mon­i­tor your bat­tery life.</p>
    <p>The kilo­me­tres can slip by while your ped­alling is aided, but the re­turn trip will be long and gru­elling if you have drained your bat­tery, es­pe­cially since e-bikes, in gen­eral, are heav­ier than stan­dard bi­cy­cles.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, wear a mask if you are around other rid­ers and pedes­tri­ans, and per­haps add a jaunty bell to your bike, if it was not stan­dard equip­ment. Sound it be­fore pass­ing any­one.</p>
    <p>“Treat oth­ers as you would like to be treated,” Kenny says. “It’s never fun to be star­tled by a zoom­ing cy­clist.”</p>
