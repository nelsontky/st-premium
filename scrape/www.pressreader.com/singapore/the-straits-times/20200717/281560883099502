    <p>Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics (SA) yes­ter­day sought to ex­plain the con­tentious pro­posal to re­move the vot­ing rights of the ap­pointed ath­letes’ com­mis­sion rep­re­sen­ta­tive through an amend­ment of its Con­sti­tu­tion, which was one of three pro­posed amend­ments to SA’s char­ter that were not passed dur­ing its ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ing on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics (SA) chief Tang Weng Fei last night ex­plained its de­ci­sion to pro­pose the re­moval of vot­ing rights for its ath­letes’ com­mis­sion (AC) rep­re­sen­ta­tive as part of a re­view of its con­sti­tu­tion, a move which has drawn crit­i­cism from some quar­ters.</p>
    <p>He told The Straits Times that while the AC rep­re­sen­ta­tive has been a part of SA’s man­age­ment com­mit­tee since last year, there were no “proper pro­cesses” set out in the na­tional track and field body’s con­sti­tu­tion with re­gard to the role.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the AC rep­re­sen­ta­tive is ap­pointed based on “in­ter­nal pro­cesses, not vet­ted by af­fil­i­ated mem­bers”, said Tang, and SA sought to rec­tify this with the amend­ment.</p>
    <p>“While the AC rep­re­sen­ta­tive was to have a vot­ing right on the board... (SA) was un­cer­tain about the ini­tial, in­fant pro­cesses of set­ting up the new con­sti­tu­tion­ally-in­sti­tuted ath­letes’ com­mis­sion, and was con­cerned about the di­lu­tion of the vot­ing rights of the board mem­bers who were di­rectly elected by af­fil­i­ated mem­bers,” he ex­plained.</p>
    <p>“This po­si­tion was com­mu­ni­cated to SportSG (na­tional sports agency Sport Sin­ga­pore).</p>
    <p>“SA takes the view that the em­pow­er­ment of per­sons on the board (with the nec­es­sary vot­ing rights) should be based only on the demo­cratic votes of the af­fil­i­ated mem­bers.”</p>
    <p>He also noted that at the SA ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ing (EOGM) to de­bate the con­sti­tu­tional changes on Mon­day, “the po­si­tion of the MC was com­mu­ni­cated to the af­fil­i­ated mem­bers”.</p>
    <p>High­light­ing that the is­sue of vot­ing rights af­fected all non-elected board mem­bers and not just the ath­letes’ com­mis­sion, he added: “It was em­pha­sised that the ath­letes’ com­mis­sion rep­re­sen­ta­tive was an ap­pointed board mem­ber, and all ap­pointed board mem­bers are pro­posed to not be af­forded vot­ing rights on the board.”</p>
    <p>He pointed out that 13 of the 20 af­fil­i­ate mem­bers present had voted in favour of re­scind­ing the AC rep­re­sen­ta­tive’s vot­ing rights al­though this meant the pro­posed amend­ment re­mains un­re­solved.</p>
    <p>This is ow­ing to dif­fer­ing opin­ions over the in­ter­pre­ta­tion of the vot­ing pro­ce­dures spelt out in SA’s con­sti­tu­tion, af­ter two mem­bers ab­stained from vot­ing.</p>
    <p>SA’s char­ter states that al­ter­ations or dele­tions to the con­sti­tu­tion can be passed only “with the con­sent of two-thirds of vot­ing mem­bers present”.</p>
    <p>One of SA’s two le­gal ad­vis­ers be­lieved the two-thirds rule should ap­ply to all 20 mem­bers that were present, mean­ing 14 votes are needed to pass the pro­posal, while the other ad­viser said the rule should ap­ply to only the 18 who voted, mean­ing only 12 votes are needed to make the change set.</p>
    <p>Tang has said SA would seek “in­de­pen­dent le­gal opin­ion” on the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>He is­sued last night’s state­ment in re­sponse to a leaked au­dio record­ing of the EOGM’s pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>In the clip, Tang was heard re­spond­ing to a question from Ron Koh, the honorary sec­re­tary of Wings Ath­let­ics Club, one of SA’s 23 af­fil­i­ate mem­bers, on why SA pro­posed re­mov­ing the vot­ing rights of the AC rep­re­sen­ta­tive.</p>
    <p>Tang had replied: “I think even in World Ath­let­ics, there is an ath­letes’ com­mis­sion (and) that ap­point­ment has no vot­ing rights in</p>
    <p>World Ath­let­ics.</p>
    <p>“And mind you, these clauses are manda­tory clauses set up by SportSG, not by us.”</p>
    <p>A SportSG spokesman had told ST on Tues­day night that it pro­vided “guid­ance through a set of gov­er­nance prin­ci­ples for na­tional sports as­so­ci­a­tions (NSAs) and a tem­plate of a model con­sti­tu­tion”.</p>
    <p>These were de­vel­oped af­ter con­sul­ta­tion with the Reg­istry of So­ci­eties (ROS), Com­mis­sioner of Char­i­ties (COC) and Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Olympic Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>The SportSG tem­plate of a model con­sti­tu­tion lists the ath­letes’ com­mis­sion chair­man or rep­re­sen­ta­tive as hav­ing vot­ing rights, al­though it is not a re­quire­ment of the ROS or COC. The chair­man is ap­pointed to the board and is elected to his or her po­si­tion by na­tional ath­letes, not by the as­so­ci­a­tion’s af­fil­i­ates.</p>
    <p>The SportSG spokesman added: “They (the tem­plates) pro­vide our NSAs a ba­sis to struc­ture and im­ple­ment their or­gan­i­sa­tion and in­stru­ments for proper gov­er­nance, while ac­count­ing for the spe­cific cir­cum­stances of their sport...</p>
    <p>“We have given our views on their pro­posed amend­ments and re­quested (that SA) share with us the re­vised ver­sion...</p>
    <p>“(We have) not re­viewed the lat­est amend­ments SA has cir­cu­lated to its mem­bers.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, Tang has in­sisted that SA had been “in­formed, in writ­ing, that the SportSG ‘sam­ple clauses’ pro­vided to us are ‘manda­tory’, in ac­cor­dance with SportSG’s ‘manda­tory gov­er­nance prin­ci­ples’, and re­quire­ments by ROS and the COC”.</p>
    <p>“As SA per­forms as a NSA un­der SportSG, a so­ci­ety un­der ROS, and a char­ity un­der COC, SA un­der­stood its re­spon­si­bil­i­ties to align it­self with the re­quire­ments by the au­thor­i­ta­tive bod­ies,” he added.</p>
    <p>The re­moval of vot­ing rights for the AC rep­re­sen­ta­tive was one of three pro­posed amend­ments to SA’s char­ter that were not passed dur­ing Mon­day night’s EOGM.</p>
    <p>An­other mooted change, to keep pro­ceed­ings in man­age­ment com­mit­tee meet­ings con­fi­den­tial, was also held up be­cause of the in­ter­pre­ta­tion of the two-thirds majority vot­ing pro­ce­dure.</p>
    <p>A third pro­posed amend­ment, to change the cri­te­ria for af­fil­i­ate mem­ber­ship by re­quir­ing clubs to sub­mit doc­u­ments such as fi­nan­cial re­ports and min­utes of gen­eral meet­ings, was dis­carded.</p>
    <p>DEMOC­RACY THE GUID­ING PRIN­CI­PLE</p>
    <p>SA takes the view that the em­pow­er­ment of per­sons on the board (with the nec­es­sary vot­ing rights) should be based only on the demo­cratic votes of the af­fil­i­ated mem­bers.</p>
