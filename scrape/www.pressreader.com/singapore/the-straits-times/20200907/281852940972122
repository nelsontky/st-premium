    <p>MOSCOW • De­fence min­is­ters from In­dia and China have agreed to defuse ten­sions af­ter the l at­est clash on their Hi­malayan bor­der re­vived a con­flict that had been largely dor­mant since June.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s Ra­j­nath Singh and his Chi­nese coun­ter­part Wei Fenghe held “frank and in-depth dis­cus­sions” in Moscow last Fri­day about de­vel­op­ments on the bor­der and on bi­lat­eral re­la­tions, a state­ment from In­dia’s Min­istry of De­fence said.</p>
    <p>While the state­ment said the two min­is­ters agreed to ease ten­sions, both sides blamed the other for the fresh con­flict.</p>
    <p>Mul­ti­ple rounds of high-level mil­i­tary talks have failed to end the months-long stand-off be­tween China and In­dia, and both sides have moved thou­sands of troops, tanks, ar­tillery guns and fighter jets close to the bor­der since May.</p>
    <p>The lat­est skir­mish late last week took place along Pan­gong Tso – a glacial lake at 4,242m – along the 3,488km Line of Ac­tual Con­trol.</p>
    <p>In­dia had said its sol­diers were able to stop a push by Chi­nese troops to claim more ground in vi­o­la­tion of ex­ist­ing agree­ments, while Bei­jing de­nied its troops had strayed into In­dian ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>In­dia wanted to set­tle the dis­pute through talks, “but at the same time, there should also be no doubt about our de­ter­mi­na­tion to pro­tect In­dia’s sovereignt­y and ter­ri­to­rial in­tegrity”, Delhi said.</p>
    <p>China’s De­fence Min­is­ter took a sim­i­larly tough line.</p>
    <p>Gen­eral Wei said: “The cause and truth of the cur­rent ten­sion on the bor­der be­tween China and In­dia are very clear, and the re­spon­si­bil­ity lies en­tirely with In­dia.”</p>
    <p>He added that “China’s ter­ri­tory can­not be lost”, call­ing on In­dia to “strengthen con­trol of front-line forces” and “re­frain from any ac­tions that may cause the sit­u­a­tion to heat up”.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh “em­pha­sised that the ac­tions of the Chi­nese troops, in­clud­ing amass­ing of large num­bers of troops, their ag­gres­sive be­hav­iour and at­tempts to uni­lat­er­ally al­ter the sta­tus quo were in vi­o­la­tion of the bi­lat­eral agree­ments, and not in keep­ing with the un­der­stand­ings reached be­tween the spe­cial rep­re­sen­ta­tives of two sides”, ac­cord­ing to the In­dian De­fence Min­istry’s state­ment last Sat­ur­day.</p>
    <p>He said In­dian troops had taken “a very re­spon­si­ble ap­proach to­wards bor­der man­age­ment, but at the same time, there should also be no doubt about our de­ter­mi­na­tion to pro­tect In­dia’s sovereignt­y and ter­ri­to­rial in­tegrity”, it added.</p>
    <p>In­dia and China’s worst dis­pute in four decades cul­mi­nated in the death of 20 In­dian sol­diers and an un­known num­ber of Chi­nese ca­su­al­ties in a bat­tle in June.</p>
    <p>The con­flict has prompted eco­nomic ties to de­te­ri­o­rate, with In­dia lim­it­ing Chi­nese in­vest­ments, tight­en­ing scru­tiny on visas and mov­ing to keep Huawei Tech­nolo­gies out of In­dia’s 5G net­works.</p>
