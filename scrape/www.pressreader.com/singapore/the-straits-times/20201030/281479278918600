    <p>A new tri­par­tite work group will study how to in­crease the wages of more low-in­come work­ers and im­prove their well-be­ing. Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Man­power Zaqy Mo­hamad said it aims to give rec­om­men­da­tions by early 2022.</p>
    <p>A new tri­par­tite work group will study how to in­crease the wages of more low-in­come work­ers and im­prove their well-be­ing, be­yond ex­ist­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The Tri­par­tite Work­group on Lower-Wage Work­ers will be chaired by Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Man­power Zaqy Mo­hamad and in­clude in­dus­try lead­ers from the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion, union lead­ers and se­nior civil ser­vants from agen­cies that are in­volved with low-wage work­ers.</p>
    <p>Yesterday, Mr Zaqy said the work group aims to pro­vide a progress up­date by the mid­dle of next year, and give its rec­om­men­da­tions by early 2022.</p>
    <p>It will pro­pose in­ter­ven­tions and mech­a­nisms that will en­sure that wage growth in manda­tory pro­gres­sive wage model (PWM) sec­tors con­tin­ues to out­pace me­dian wage growth. Other goals are to sig­nif­i­cantly in­crease the num­ber of low-in­come work­ers cov­ered by PWMs, and of­fer pro­gres­sive wages in oc­cu­pa­tions not cov­ered by the manda­tory PWMs.</p>
    <p>The work group will also pro­pose ways to recog­nise and pro­mote stronger so­ci­etal sup­port for firms pay­ing pro­gres­sive wages, and to ad­vance the well-be­ing of low-in­come work­ers.</p>
    <p>The PWM, which was de­vel­oped by unions, em­ploy­ers and the Gov­ern­ment, has helped to lift wages of work­ers in the clean­ing, se­cu­rity and land­scape sec­tors since it was in­tro­duced in 2012, said Mr Zaqy.</p>
    <p>It lays out the min­i­mum wages em­ploy­ers need to pay their work­ers, based on their in­di­vid­ual skill lev­els. To rise up the wage lad­der, work­ers at­tend skills cour­ses to up­grade them­selves.</p>
    <p>Be­tween 2014 and last year, the real wages of work­ers in these sec­tors rose by around 30 per cent – higher than the me­dian of 21 per cent for all sec­tors, the Min­istry of Man­power said yesterday.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, the PWM has ben­e­fited about 80,000 work­ers. In 2022, the lifts and es­ca­la­tor main­te­nance sec­tor will be in­cluded un­der the PWM, the min­istry added.</p>
    <p>The Work­fare In­come Sup­ple­ment (WIS), in­tro­duced in 2007, is among gov­ern­ment mea­sures im­ple­mented over the last decade to raise low-in­come work­ers’ pay.</p>
    <p>The WIS scheme boosts the in­come and re­tire­ment sav­ings of about 400,000 low-in­come work­ers an­nu­ally by up to 30 per cent, said MOM. From 2007 to last year, over $6.8 bil­lion was given out to 890,000 low-in­come work­ers.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Work­care ini­tia­tive was launched last year to im­prove the work en­vi­ron­ment of low-in­come work­ers, such as by pro­vid­ing proper rest ar­eas for clean­ers and se­cu­rity of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>Mr Zaqy said yesterday that the work group will ex­am­ine is­sues faced by low-in­come work­ers in a holis­tic man­ner.</p>
    <p>“The study that we plan to do has to be wide-rang­ing, to see how we can cre­ate a win-win with the em­ploy­ers, unions and work­ers, to see how dif­fer­ent sec­tors can be im­proved and go as far as they can (in wages),” he added.</p>
    <p>It will also “keep an open mind” and look be­yond the pro­gres­sive wage model to see what will work best in rais­ing wages for these work­ers in dif­fer­ent sec­tors, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Zaqy was vis­it­ing a DBS branch in Ma­rina Bay Fi­nan­cial Cen­tre yesterday. Dur­ing the visit, he also met the branch’s clean­ing ser­vice provider Spic & Span, which shared how it is boost­ing ca­reer pro­gres­sion prospects of low-wage work­ers through the use of tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Mr Zaqy said the work group will be sen­si­tive to busi­ness con­di­tions so that any mea­sures pro­posed do not dis­cour­age com­pa­nies from hir­ing these work­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Mohd Fahmi Ali­man, direc­tor of op­er­a­tions and mo­bil­i­sa­tion divi­sion secretaria­t at the Na­tional Trades Union Congress, said: “This work group will give us the op­por­tu­nity to con­tinue to look after our work­ers... It is a work in progress. There are many sec­tors that we need to con­tinue to reach out to, to help them un­der­stand the ben­e­fit of the PWM.”</p>
