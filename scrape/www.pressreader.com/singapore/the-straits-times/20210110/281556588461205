    <p>The Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion drive kicked off in the pri­vate health­care sec­tor yes­ter­day, with 50 staff from the Park­way Pan­tai group re­ceiv­ing the Pfizer-BioN­Tech shot.</p>
    <p>The shots were ad­min­is­tered at two lo­ca­tions. Thirty doc­tors and nurses were given the jab at Mount El­iz­a­beth Novena Hos­pi­tal. Another 20 got the vac­cine at Mount El­iz­a­beth Hos­pi­tal in Or­chard.</p>
    <p>Among those in­oc­u­lated at the Novena hos­pi­tal were Park­way Pan­tai’s se­nior ex­ec­u­tives and some of the hos­pi­tal’s in­fec­tious disease physi­cians, who said they hoped to lead by ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>The move would re­as­sure their col­leagues who may be hes­i­tant about get­ting the vac­cine, which uses mes­sen­ger RNA tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Dr Prem Kumar Nair, chief ex­ec­u­tive for the Singapore Oper­a­tions Divi­sion at Park­way Pan­tai, told the me­dia as he re­ceived the shot in his left arm: “I echo what PM Lee said yes­ter­day – it’s pain­less, it’s ef­fi­ca­cious and it’s im­por­tant.”</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong had taken the Covid-19 vac­cine on Fri­day morn­ing, at the start of a na­tion­wide drive to pro­tect staff across var­i­ous public health­care in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>Dr Prem, who thanked the Min­istry of Health for ex­tend­ing vac­ci­na­tions be­yond public hos­pi­tals, said the group aims to in­oc­u­late as many of its staff, tem­po­rary work­ers and ven­dors as pos­si­ble over the next few weeks.</p>
    <p>The health­care group hopes to achieve a vac­ci­na­tion rate of 90 per cent among its front-line work­ers, who num­ber more than 8,000. About 70 per cent of them have so far in­di­cated their in­ter­est in re­ceiv­ing the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tions are vol­un­tary in Singapore.</p>
    <p>Said Dr Prem: “We thought that we would start off to­day by hav­ing the lead­er­ship of Park­way Pan­tai have their vac­cines. And this in­cludes some of our key in­fec­tious disease physi­cians as well.”</p>
    <p>He added that there will be a few among the staff who may be wor­ried about tak­ing the vac­cine due to con­cerns over side ef­fects, and this fear is some­thing the lead­er­ship wants to dis­pel by tak­ing the lead and also through out­reach ses­sions like town­hall meet­ings.</p>
    <p>Other than Dr Prem, 60, Dr Noel Yeo, 40, Park­way Pan­tai’s chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer for Singapore oper­a­tions, and Dr Peter Chow, 46, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Mount El­iz­a­beth Novena Hos­pi­tal, were also vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>The group’s in­fec­tious disease spe­cial­ists – Dr Leong Hoe Nam, 50, and Dr Asok Kurup, 53 – also re­ceived the shot.</p>
    <p>Dr Asok said while me­dia re­ports have high­lighted in­stances of people ex­pe­ri­enc­ing se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tions, th­ese were very rare.</p>
    <p>The United States Cen­tres for Disease Con­trol and Preven­tion last Wed­nes­day re­leased a re­port which found that only about 11.1 such re­ac­tions had oc­curred per mil­lion doses ad­min­is­tered.</p>
    <p>“So we are look­ing at a very rare oc­cur­rence. But even if such in­stances should hap­pen, there are mea­sures in place to treat them,” he added.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, those who re­ceived the vac­cine were mon­i­tored for at least 30 min­utes on site. Crash carts and mon­i­tors were kept nearby, and ac­ci­dent and emer­gency doc­tors were asked to be on standby.</p>
    <p>Mount El­iz­a­beth Novena Hos­pi­tal nurse ed­u­ca­tor Nursyahi­dah Ab­dul Rahim, 35, was one of the front-line work­ers who re­ceived the vac­cine yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We do our social distancing, we have learnt about per­sonal hy­giene but just one piece was miss­ing. And now it’s fi­nally com­plete.</p>
    <p>“This vac­cine is some­thing that we’ve been wait­ing for.”</p>
