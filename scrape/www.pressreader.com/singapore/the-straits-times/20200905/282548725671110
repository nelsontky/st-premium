    <p>LAVAUR (France) • The Tour de France burst into life when a fast start and cross­winds blew the pelo­ton apart in the sev­enth stage, leav­ing dark horse Tadej Po­gacar with a lot of catch­ing up to do ahead of the Pyre­nees to­day.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s 168km ride from Mil­lau was dom­i­nated by Belgian Wout van Aert, who won his se­cond Tour stage in three days, af­ter a bru­tal start by Peter Sa­gan’s Bo­raHans­grohe team and cross­winds had split the pack.</p>
    <p>“I’m re­ally proud of this one,” said Team J umbo-Visma’s van Aert, who also won Stage 5 on Wed­nes­day. “We rode flat out straight from the gun. Ev­ery­one could feel the cross­winds dur­ing the race.</p>
    <p>“It was an in­cred­i­ble fin­ish. I found a gap on the right hand side and I timed my sprint per­fectly.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t expect this morn­ing that I’d be com­pet­ing for the vic­tory. It’s more of a sur­prise to­day. No­body ex­pected such a hard race!”</p>
    <p>A sud­den ac­cel­er­a­tion by cham­pion Egan Ber­nal’s Ineos Gre­nadiers team split the lead­ing pack again with Slove­nian Po­gacar, one of the most fan­cied un­der­dogs of the race, find­ing him­self trapped be­hind and los­ing 1min 21sec on the line.</p>
    <p>The UAE Emi­rates rider is now ex­pected to be on the at­tack in the Pyre­nees this week­end.</p>
    <p>Bri­ton Adam Yates, along with Pri­moz Roglic, Ber­nal and Pinot, was on the right side of the break and re­tained the over­all leader’s yel­low jer­sey. He now leads Roglic by three seconds and France’s Guil­laume Martin by nine.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a cou­ple of ex­tremely quiet days, the pelo­ton was thrown into a tum­bler when Bora-Hans­grohe’s at­tack on the first climb left most of the sprint­ers be­hind.</p>
    <p>That boosted Sa­gan’s quest for a record-ex­tend­ing eighth green jer­sey for the points clas­si­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Green jer­sey holder Sam Bennett, as well as Aus­tralian Cadel Ewan, were far be­hind and could not con­test the in­ter­me­di­ate sprint, where Sa­gan col­lected 17 points af­ter be­ing beaten by only Mat­teo Trentin.</p>
    <p>Triple world cham­pion Sa­gan again lost out in the fi­nal sprint won by Mi­lan-San­remo cham­pion van Aert, but the Slo­vak picked up an ex­tra four points to leapfrog Ir­ish­man Bennett to the top of the points clas­si­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>To­day’s eighth stage is a 141km moun­tain trek in the Pyre­nees, fea­tur­ing the as­cents of the Col de Mente, the Port de Bales and the Col de Peyre­sourde.</p>
    <p>While the down­hill fin­ish might lead the big guns to hold their fire again, any at­tempt by Po­gacar to re­gain some time could trig­ger some move­ment.</p>
