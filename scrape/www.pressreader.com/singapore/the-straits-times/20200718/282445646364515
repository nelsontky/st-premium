    <p>WELLING­TON • A ruth­less shakeup is on the cards af­ter New Zealand Rugby (NZR) yes­ter­day re­vealed plans to cull South African teams and Ar­gentina’s Jaguares from Su­per Rugby next year.</p>
    <p>The planned revamp of the flag­ship South­ern Hemi­sphere club tour­na­ment would com­prise the five ex­ist­ing do­mes­tic teams, two to four from Aus­tralia and one new­comer from the Pa­cific Is­lands, giv­ing it a strong trans-Tas­man fo­cus.</p>
    <p>South Africa, which co-founded Su­per Rugby in 1996 with Aus­tralia and New Zealand, would see its five teams dumped, along with the Jaguares.</p>
    <p>The com­pe­ti­tion, which at one stage had 18 teams, has long been crit­i­cised for be­ing un­wieldy, ex­pen­sive to run, ex­haust­ing for elite play­ers and dif­fi­cult for fans to fol­low, and the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has com­pounded those prob­lems.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s Sun­wolves, who have also played games in Hong Kong and at Sin­ga­pore’s Na­tional Sta­dium, were the first vic­tims of the Covid-19 cri­sis af­ter a five-year run.</p>
    <p>Last month, Sun­wolves bowed out of Su­per Rugby, hav­ing failed to join the Aus­tralian off­shoot of the tour­na­ment, which has been put on ice in­def­i­nitely since March due to global travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Both New Zealand and Aus­tralia have formed do­mes­tic spin-offs as a re­sult – Su­per Rugby Aotearoa and Su­per Rugby AU – but there has been no news about a South African com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>On the fur­ther stream­lin­ing, NZR chief ex­ec­u­tive Mark Robin­son blamed the pan­demic for the</p>
    <p>“ex­tremely tough” de­ci­sions, ex­plain­ing that long-haul travel was now im­pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>He was also un­able to pro­vide de­tails of whether govern­ing body San­zaar would over­see the new com­pe­ti­tion, the club own­er­ship struc­ture or even whether it would still be called Su­per Rugby.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Robin­son be­lieves his pro­posal will re­vi­talise the game, as some of the games in its cur­rent for­mat “put me to sleep”.</p>
    <p>Rugby Aus­tralia ac­knowl­edged NZR’s plans and said it recog­nised the need to re­view the “sus­tain­abil­ity and prac­ti­cal­ity” in the cur­rent en­vi­ron­ment. South Africa Rugby said it would give a full re­sponse next week.</p>
