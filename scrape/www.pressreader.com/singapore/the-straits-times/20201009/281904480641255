    <p>• In­done­sian De­fence Min­is­ter Prabowo Su­bianto has been in­vited to the United States for a bi­lat­eral dis­cus­sion on de­fence co­op­er­a­tion, a min­istry spokesman said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“US De­fence Sec­re­tary Mark Esper has in­vited Prabowo to visit the US from Oct 15 to 19,” In­done­sian De­fence Min­istry spokesman Dah­nil An­zar Simanjunta­k wrote in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>He added that Mr Prabowo has ac­cepted the in­vi­ta­tion and is set to travel to the US for the of­fi­cial visit.</p>
    <p>“In ac­cor­dance with In­done­sia’s prin­ci­ple of ‘free and ac­tive’ for­eign pol­icy and non-in­volve­ment in mil­i­tary al­liances with any coun­try... Min­is­ter Prabowo has been ac­tively en­gaged in de­fence di­plo­macy with var­i­ous coun­tries, in­clud­ing the US,” the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>It is not clear whether the in­vi­ta­tion means that Washington has, or will, grant a visa to Mr Prabowo, a re­tired three-star army gen­eral who has long been barred from the US be­cause of al­le­ga­tions of hu­man rights abuses.</p>
    <p>Mr Prabowo was in­cluded in a blan­ket ban on the In­done­sian Army’s Spe­cial Forces for al­leged hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions in East Ti­mor when the ter­ri­tory was un­der In­done­sian rule.</p>
    <p>In 2000, he was pre­vented from at­tend­ing his son’s grad­u­a­tion in Bos­ton, Mas­sachusetts.</p>
    <p>Reuters re­ported in 2012 that Mr Prabowo was again de­nied a visa by the US.</p>
    <p>Mr Sufmi Dasco Ah­mad, a politi­cian from the Gerindra party, of which Mr Prabowo is chair­man, said in Oc­to­ber last year that he be­lieved the ban had been lifted.</p>
    <p>The US Em­bassy in Jakarta pre­vi­ously said that visa records were con­fi­den­tial un­der US law and the de­tails of i ndi­vid­ual visa cases could not be dis­closed.</p>
    <p>Mil­i­tary ob­servers have said that the travel ban against Mr Prabowo may af­fect the min­is­ter’s de­ci­sions in procur­ing arms to ful­fil In­done­sia’s Min­i­mum Es­sen­tial Force pro­vi­sion.</p>
