    <p>At this point – and my feel­ings about this are al­ways go­ing to change – I just feel sort of grate­ful to have a dad who en­joys do­ing the same things as I do. That’s a very special thing to have.</p>
    <p>HOME-GROWN FILM-MAKER ED­WARD KHOO (above), on hav­ing Sin­ga­pore di­rec­tor Eric Khoo (left) as his fa­ther. The younger Khoo is work­ing on a script for a hor­ror film, ten­ta­tively ti­tled Pris­on­ers Of The Pa­cific</p>
    <p>Ed­ward Khoo was just 18 when his short film Late Shift, which was about an elderly taxi driver’s en­counter with a drunk pas­sen­ger, pre­miered at the 17th Bu­san In­ter­na­tional Film Fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>The 26-year-old has by now made about four short films and is work­ing on a script for a hor­ror film, ten­ta­tively ti­tled Pris­on­ers Of The Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>He calls it a “crea­ture fea­ture”, with par­al­lels to sur­vival hor­ror films such as Crea­ture From The Black La­goon (1954) and Alien (1979).</p>
    <p>The film is pro­duced by Go­ry­lah Pic­tures – run by home-grown film-maker Eric Khoo (Ed­ward Khoo’s fa­ther) and Mike Wiluan, film-maker and chief ex­ec­u­tive of In­fi­nite Stu­dios.</p>
    <p>As one might ex­pect, Khoo is of­ten asked about his fa­mous fa­ther, known for films such as Mee Pok Man (1995) and 12 Storeys (1997), and whether he feels he has big shoes to fill.</p>
    <p>“I have rote re­sponses to this now,” he replies with a laugh.</p>
    <p>“At this point – and my feel­ings about this are al­ways go­ing to change – I just feel sort of grate­ful to have a dad who en­joys do­ing the same things as I do. That’s a very special thing to have.”</p>
    <p>This year, fa­ther and son worked to­gether on a com­mis­sioned short film for ciNE65 2021.</p>
    <p>The nos­tal­gic short was set in Rida Video Cen­tre, a video-rental store in Bukit Timah.</p>
    <p>Ed­ward Khoo is the el­dest of four sons. His broth­ers, aged be­tween 21 and 25, do not plan on en­ter­ing the industry.</p>
    <p>When they were lit­tle, they made stop-mo­tion an­i­mated films for fun and were weaned on a diet of movies such as The God­fa­ther (1972), The Ex­or­cist (1973) and Mid­night Cow­boy (1969).</p>
    <p>Khoo got more se­ri­ous about film-mak­ing around 15, when he did a video-edit­ing course as a stu­dent at the Sin­ga­pore Amer­i­can School.</p>
    <p>The younger Khoo re­turned to Sin­ga­pore in March with a de­gree from the pres­ti­gious Tisch School of the Arts in New York.</p>
    <p>The idea for Pris­on­ers Of The Pa­cific “was born out of us be­ing in lock­down, watch­ing a bunch of films”.</p>
    <p>He is writ­ing the script with film pro­ducer Huang Junx­i­ang and drew in­spi­ra­tion from John Boor­man’s Hell In The Pa­cific (1968).</p>
    <p>Pris­on­ers is about a group of Ja­panese soldiers and pris­on­er­sof-war ma­rooned on an In­done­sian is­land in the thick of World War II, who are be­ing hunted by an orang ikan (“fish man” in Malay).</p>
    <p>A few weeks ago, the project won a US$5,000 (S$6,600) award at the In­ter­na­tional Film Fes­ti­val & Awards Ma­cao, where its Sin­ga­pore team had sought fi­nanc­ing and co-pro­duc­tion part­ners.</p>
    <p>Khoo says: “I’m happy to cowrite this thing, but in terms of putting a de­fin­i­tive di­rec­tor’s stamp on it, I don’t know if I’m ready to do that yet.”</p>
    <p>Co-writer Huang will be di­rect­ing in­stead.</p>
    <p>Khoo has also thought about what the fu­ture might hold.</p>
    <p>His fa­ther’s Zhao Wei Films is named af­ter Ed­ward, who says: “One thing I joke about is that if I ever had my own pro­duc­tion house, I would name it af­ter my dad, whose Chi­nese name is Qiu Jin Hai (lit­er­ally “golden sea”).</p>
    <p>“There’s a real old-school Hong Kong, 1980s ring to that – Golden River Pic­tures.”</p>
