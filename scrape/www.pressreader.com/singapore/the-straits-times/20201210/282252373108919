    <p>Asia’s first chest pain spe­cial­ist clinic at Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hospi­tal has clinched an ex­cel­lence award, for im­prov­ing pa­tient ex­pe­ri­ence, at the Asian Hospi­tal Man­age­ment Awards this year.</p>
    <p>A pi­lot scheme since April last year, the rapid ac­cess chest pain clinic al­lows those ex­pe­ri­enc­ing in­ter­mit­tent dis­com­fort in their chest to get it checked quickly by a heart spe­cial­ist – within 24 hours of re­fer­ral – and re­ceive one-stop eval­u­a­tion and di­ag­no­sis.</p>
    <p>So far, the clinic has re­duced the wait­ing time to get a di­ag­no­sis from un­der two months to a day, low­ered the num­ber of hospi­tal vis­its by half and re­duced the cost of med­i­cal tests by 20 per cent.</p>
    <p>Led by Dr Pipin Ko­jod­jojo, who is also se­nior con­sul­tant at the Na­tional Univer­sity Heart Cen­tre, Sin­ga­pore’s Depart­ment of Car­di­ol­ogy, the clinic has, to date, eval­u­ated more than 500 pa­tients with new on­set chest pain.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Dr Pipin said, peo­ple who are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing per­sis­tent and se­vere chest pain should call an am­bu­lance for im­me­di­ate treat­ment as they could be hav­ing a heart at­tack.</p>
    <p>“But they are the mi­nor­ity of pa­tients. Most peo­ple ex­pe­ri­ence chest pain that comes and goes and it doesn’t seem very se­ri­ous, but they want to find out what’s wrong,” he said at a me­dia brief­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“For these pa­tients, they can visit the chest pain clinic in­stead of the emer­gency depart­ment which helps to re­duce con­ges­tion there.”</p>
    <p>To get an ap­point­ment at the chest pain clinic, a re­fer­ral let­ter from either Jurong Poly­clinic or Pi­o­neer Poly­clinic is needed.</p>
    <p>Within 24 work­ing hours of the re­fer­ral, a heart spe­cial­ist from the chest pain clinic will see the pa­tient, run tests and di­ag­nose him on the same day. This was not pos­si­ble be­fore, un­less the pa­tient was sent to the emer­gency depart­ment.</p>
    <p>Dr Pipin said get­ting a hospi­tal di­ag­no­sis for chest pain through a poly­clinic re­fer­ral can take an av­er­age of four weeks and re­quire sev­eral trips to the hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>“Al­low­ing con­sul­ta­tion and test­ing to be com­pleted within a sin­gle hospi­tal visit im­proves pa­tient con­ve­nience. It also min­imises the risk of trans­mis­sion with the cur­rent pan­demic,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Arthur Chong is one of the 500 pa­tients who have been treated at the chest pain clinic.</p>
    <p>The 49-year-old en­gi­neer was di­ag­nosed with block­ages in his ar­ter­ies and treated with mi­nor surgery within five days of ex­pe­ri­enc­ing sharp pains in his chest.</p>
    <p>He re­ceived a re­fer­ral from Pi­o­neer Poly­clinic on May 19 and was di­ag­nosed at the chest pain clinic two days later.</p>
    <p>“When my friends hear about my ex­pe­ri­ence, they ask if I’m a VIP and I say no... I went to a poly­clinic first,” he said.</p>
    <p>Four more poly­clin­ics – Queen­stown, Cle­menti, Bukit Ba­tok and Choa Chu Kang – will be col­lab­o­rat­ing with the chest pain clinic by the end of next year.</p>
