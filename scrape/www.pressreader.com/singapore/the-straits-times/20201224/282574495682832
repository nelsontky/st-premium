    <p>If the thought of be­ing sin­gle over the hol­i­days fills you with dread, a new movie pro­poses a so­lu­tion: pre­tend to be cou­pled up with some­one just to get through the fes­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In the ro­man­tic com­edy Holidate, two strangers – Sloane (Emma Roberts) and Jack­son (Luke Bracey) – make a pact to do that for a year, to avoid the awk­ward­ness of bad dates and fly­ing solo at so­cial events.</p>
    <p>But even though they start out not be­ing ro­man­ti­cally in­ter­ested in each other, sparks in­evitably fly.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing over video call, the ac­tors ad­mit they have never felt any so­cial pres­sure when they have been sin­gle in the past, but feel for those who have.</p>
    <p>And they won­der whether the dat­ing game has changed dur­ing the pan­demic, and if some beau­ti­ful love sto­ries might come out of this pe­riod.</p>
    <p>As for be­ing sin­gle dur­ing the hol­i­days, Bracey, the 31-year-old Aus­tralian star of surf movie Point Break (2015), says: “My fam­ily has al­ways been quite chill about it all.</p>
    <p>“I’ve got a cou­ple of older sis­ters and they’ve started fam­i­lies be­fore me, so that might’ve taken a lit­tle bit of the pres­sure off. There are grand­kids in the fam­ily al­ready.”</p>
    <p>We’re The Millers (2013) ac­tress Roberts, 29, says she has never been made to feel bad for be­ing un­at­tached.</p>
    <p>“And dur­ing the hol­i­days, I feel like it’s more about fam­ily and friends any­way.”</p>
    <p>Yet she can eas­ily re­late to Sloane, her char­ac­ter in this film. “She’s over it be­cause she feels like she’s not at the place in her life that she wants to be at yet.</p>
    <p>“And I think the hol­i­days mag­nify that be­cause ev­ery­one’s ask­ing you so many ques­tions, and it kind of makes you pause and look at where you’re at, es­pe­cially if you haven’t had the best year,” says the star, who has ap­peared i n the an­thol­ogy se­ries Amer­i­can Hor­ror Story (2013 to now).</p>
    <p>The ac­tors are asked if they think dat­ing has changed dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, which some ob­servers think is push­ing more peo­ple to date on­line and pair up to avoid iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“Well, I’m preg­nant and with some­one, so I don’t know about that,” says Roberts with a laugh. She is ex­pect­ing her first child with ac­tor hus­band Gar­rett Hed­lund, 36.</p>
    <p>Bracey jokes that ro­mance has not ex­actly bloomed for him dur­ing the Covid-19 lock­downs ei­ther.</p>
    <p>“I mean, I was stay­ing with my par­ents for a cou­ple of months over the year – the first time I had since I was 19, so that was a whole other thing,” he says.</p>
    <p>“But I have some friends who had met peo­ple just be­fore it all hap­pened, and then it brought them re­ally close to­gether. Ob­vi­ously, there are sto­ries that go the other way as well.</p>
    <p>“I think we’re all just try­ing to fig­ure it out on the run,” he adds. “And I think some beau­ti­ful sto­ries are go­ing to come from this. In the fu­ture, there are go­ing to be some sweet rom­coms that are go­ing to</p>
    <p>My fam­ily has al­ways been quite chill about it all. I’ve got a cou­ple of older sis­ters and they’ve started fam­i­lies be­fore me, so that might’ve taken a lit­tle bit of the pres­sure off. There are grand­kids in the fam­ily al­ready.</p>
    <p>AC­TOR LUKE BRACEY (left, with Holidate co-star Emma Roberts) on not feel­ing the so­cial pres­sure to be at­tached over the hol­i­days</p>
    <p>come out of this.”</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, there is this hol­i­day rom­com, which the ac­tors say is not the typ­i­cal one.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause you see ev­ery hol­i­day,” Roberts says. “It may seem like just Christ­mas and New Year’s at first, but we ac­tu­ally go to Easter, Mother’s Day, the Fourth of July and Hal­loween.</p>
    <p>“So, it re­ally is a year’s worth of hol­i­days packed into one movie and it’s so fun to watch.”</p>
    <p>And, Bracey adds, this is a movie that “knows it’s a ro­man­tic com­edy”. There are mo­ments of self-aware­ness in the film which com­ment on the tropes that come with the ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>He says: “We also do a lit­tle bit of a flip on what you’ve come to ex­pect from a rom­com – dif­fer­ent char­ac­ters take on the op­po­site role from what’s ex­pected.</p>
    <p>“So it’s a fresh take on a genre that we all love and adore. Be­cause even if you don’t openly ad­mit it, we all have a soft spot for ro­man­tic come­dies.”</p>
