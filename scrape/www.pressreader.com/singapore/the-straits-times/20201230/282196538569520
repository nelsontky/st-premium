    <p>Hyflux, which was put un­der ju­di­cial man­age­ment last month, now has only about $21.5 mil­lion in cash, ac­cord­ing to a per­son fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The amount is enough to last at least 10 months, the per­son said, ask­ing not to be iden­ti­fied be­cause the mat­ter is pri­vate.</p>
    <p>The rev­e­la­tion means this is at least the sec­ond year in which liq­uid­ity at the trou­bled wa­ter treat­ment com­pany has more than halved. It had $44.6 mil­lion in cash and equiv­a­lents at the end of last year, com­pared with about $92 mil­lion on Dec 31, 2018, ac­cord­ing to court af­fi­davits from</p>
    <p>March this year and Jan­uary 2019.</p>
    <p>Hyflux is Sin­ga­pore’s most high­pro­file debt-re­struc­tur­ing case, which has dragged on since a court-su­per­vised process be­gan in May 2018, frus­trat­ing cred­i­tors and some 34,000 re­tail in­vestors.</p>
    <p>The once cor­po­rate high flyer faces about $2.8 bil­lion of in­vestor claims, more than $1 bil­lion of which are from hold­ers of its per­pet­ual cap­i­tal se­cu­ri­ties and pref­er­ence shares.</p>
    <p>Ju­di­cial man­agers Bor­relli Walsh had said ear­lier this month that they were in talks with 14 new po­ten­tial in­vestors, with­out dis­clos­ing their iden­ti­ties. These par­ties are in ad­di­tion to five ex­ist­ing suit­ors.</p>
    <p>Half of the 14 new bid­ders for Hyflux are fi­nan­cial in­vestors, in­clud­ing one in Sin­ga­pore that man­ages more than US$100 bil­lion (S$132.9 bil­lion) in as­sets, ac­cord­ing to the per­son.</p>
    <p>The bid­ders in­clude three more suit­ors from Sin­ga­pore: another fi­nan­cial in­vestor with as­sets over US$20 bil­lion and two non-fi­nan­cial com­pa­nies with lat­est an­nual rev­enues of more than US$800 mil­lion and US$200 mil­lion each.</p>
    <p>A com­pany from Ja­pan with an­nual rev­enue of over US$40 bil­lion and another non-fi­nan­cial firm with op­er­a­tions in Sin­ga­pore and Ja­pan and yearly rev­enue of more than US$30 bil­lion are also in the race, the per­son said.</p>
