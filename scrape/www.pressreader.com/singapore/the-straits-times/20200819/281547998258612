    <p>For the first time since 1949, China did not log a sin­gle typhoon in the month of July, Chi­nese me­te­o­rol­o­gists said. China Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Ad­min­is­tra­tion deputy di­rec­tor Yu Yong out­lined the un­usual weather, say­ing that the wet sea­son this year has been “com­plex”, with “very un­even rain­fall”.</p>
    <p>Typhoon Hagupit bar­relled into China’s eastern Zhe­jiang prov­ince and Shang­hai ear­lier this month, bring­ing heavy rain, which was a re­lief for a re­gion swel­ter­ing in sum­mer heat.</p>
    <p>Its ar­rival on Aug 4 was well over­due. Hagupit was the first typhoon to make land­fall on the Chi­nese main­land in well over a month – highly un­usual con­sid­er­ing that the July to Septem­ber pe­riod is peak typhoon sea­son for China, say Chi­nese me­te­o­rol­o­gists.</p>
    <p>They pointed out that for the first time since 1949, China did not log a sin­gle typhoon in the month of July.</p>
    <p>But heavy rain lashed 27 out of 31 of the coun­try’s prov­inces since June this year, caus­ing widespread flood­ing and 179 bil­lion yuan (S$35.3 bil­lion) in eco­nomic losses.</p>
    <p>More than 63.46 mil­lion peo­ple were af­fected, lat­est fig­ures re­leased last week by Bei­jing showed.</p>
    <p>The un­usual weather, which has been blamed on fac­tors in­clud­ing the El Nino phe­nom­e­non and global warm­ing, has raised con­cerns about cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>China Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Ad­min­is­tra­tion deputy di­rec­tor Yu Yong out­lined the un­usual weather at a press brief­ing last Thurs­day, say­ing that the wet sea­son this year has been “com­plex”, with “very un­even rain­fall”. He pointed out that the south­ern parts of the coun­try, par­tic­u­larly along the Yangtze River, has ex­pe­ri­enced a longer than usual rainy sea­son, re­ceiv­ing 753.9mm of rain­fall this year, the high­est since 1961.</p>
    <p>“The north­ern parts of the coun­try are also ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a later rainy sea­son, with more in­tense rain­fall than usual,” said Mr Yu.</p>
    <p>And, de­spite the ab­sence of a typhoon last month, he said the au­thor­i­ties were ex­pect­ing seven to nine form­ing in the South China Sea or north-west Pa­cific Ocean in late Au­gust and Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>To­day, China’s south­ern prov­inces of Hainan and Guang­dong are brac­ing them­selves for the ar­rival of typhoon Hi­gos, which is ex­pected to bring tor­ren­tial rains as it makes land­fall.</p>
    <p>The lack of trop­i­cal storms in July this year – his­tor­i­cally the hottest month in China – has left parts of the coun­try swel­ter­ing, with the mer­cury hit­ting 40 deg C in prov­inces like Guang­dong and Fu­jian.</p>
    <p>The China Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Ob­ser­va­tory said in a report last month that ty­phoons play an im­por­tant role in cool­ing down these ar­eas dur­ing the sum­mer months, and also pro­vide much needed pre­cip­i­ta­tion to al­le­vi­ate droughts. “Tak­ing a global per­spec­tive, if there are no ty­phoons, the coastal re­gions of China and ar­eas along the Sea of Ja­pan (East Sea), In­dia, South-east Asia and south-eastern United States would lose a quar­ter of their pre­cip­i­ta­tion, which could lead to a short­age of fresh wa­ter,” said the report.</p>
    <p>Widespread flood­ing and more ex­treme heat­waves could be­come more com­mon­place in China as the cli­mate changes, said the McKin­sey Global In­sti­tute in June, flag­ging the threat of ex­treme and lethal heat­waves af­fect­ing 10 to 45 mil­lion peo­ple by 2030, par­tic­u­larly in the coun­try’s eastern prov­inces.</p>
    <p>“In ad­di­tion, China is forecast to face a higher like­li­hood of ex­treme rain­fall,” said the in­sti­tute in a report, not­ing also that the num­ber of peo­ple af­fected by river­ine flood­ing is ex­pected to grow from 67.5 mil­lion this year to 83 mil­lion in 2050.</p>
    <p>Ex­treme weather also poses a threat to China’s food se­cu­rity, with cli­mate ex­perts say­ing there will be a dras­tic im­pact on crop yields.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Zhang Jun­jie, di­rec­tor of Duke Kun­shan Univer­sity’s En­vi­ron­men­tal Re­search Cen­tre, told The Straits Times that yields of rice, wheat and corn in China could de­cline by 36.25 per cent, 18.26 per cent and 45.1 per cent re­spec­tively be­cause of cli­mate change, cit­ing a 2017 study that he co-wrote.</p>
    <p>Prof Zhang added that Bei­jing has recog­nised the threat and was work­ing to mit­i­gate the cli­mate threat.</p>
    <p>“In par­tic­u­lar, the re­cent fo­cus on the restora­tion of ecosys­tems will in­crease the ro­bust­ness of China’s agri­cul­tural econ­omy in re­sponse to more volatile weather in the fu­ture,” he said.</p>
