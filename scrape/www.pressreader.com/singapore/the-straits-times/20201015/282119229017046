    <p>While the $3,000 Baby Sup­port Grant will help par­ents de­fray the cost of rais­ing Sin­ga­porean chil­dren amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, lim­it­ing the el­i­gi­bil­ity to chil­dren born be­tween Oct 1 this year and Sept 30, 2022 ex­cludes a sig­nif­i­cant group of new par­ents who were hard­est hit by the cir­cuit breaker (New par­ents to get $3,000 grant to help de­fray costs, Oct 10).</p>
    <p>I gave birth to a baby in June, while Sin­ga­pore was just emerg­ing from its two-month cir­cuit breaker. When I was preg­nant with my child, I could not at­tend birthing classes, nor could I ob­tain the other nec­es­sary sup­port dur­ing what was a very stress­ful time.</p>
    <p>Af­ter child­birth, I was un­able to ob­tain the ser­vices of a con­fine­ment nanny, who was un­able to en­ter the coun­try from Malaysia ow­ing to travel re­stric­tions. Those who were avail­able came at ex­or­bi­tant prices.</p>
    <p>Hir­ing a new do­mes­tic helper was next to im­pos­si­ble. The one I hired was sup­posed to en­ter Sin­ga­pore in April, but could not ob­tain the nec­es­sary per­mits even up to six months later.</p>
    <p>In the end, I had to ter­mi­nate the con­tract when the Man­power Min­istry’s in-prin­ci­ple ap­proval ex­pired, for­feit­ing a sig­nif­i­cant chunk of my de­posit in the process.</p>
    <p>Al­to­gether, it was a re­ally tough and lonely jour­ney for me and my hus­band, be­ing first-time par­ents.</p>
    <p>The lat­est Baby Sup­port Grant serves to in­cen­tivise couples to start a fam­ily amid the pan­demic, rather than help those who al­ready wel­comed new ad­di­tions to the fam­ily dur­ing this pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The Baby Bonus has been around for years, yet our fer­til­ity rate con­tin­ues to fall. Hav­ing chil­dren is a deeply per­sonal de­ci­sion and one that is un­likely to be swayed by mone­tary in­cen­tives that can go up to $10,000, con­sid­er­ing that rais­ing a child in Sin­ga­pore is es­ti­mated to cost a few hun­dred thou­sand to more than half a mil­lion dol­lars ($3,000 baby grant: We need help too, other par­ents say, Oct 11).</p>
    <p>So rather than pro­vid­ing more fi­nan­cial in­cen­tives in the hope of coax­ing couples to have chil­dren, spare a thought for those who have cho­sen to be­come new par­ents, even amid this very tough time.</p>
