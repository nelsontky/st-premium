    <p>Even with tighter curbs to rein in the spread of Covid-19, Hong Kong is not get­ting any re­prieve, with the death toll up and more clus­ters break­ing out in dif­fer­ent build­ings, in­clud­ing the most re­cent one at a do­mes­tic helper dor­mi­tory.</p>
    <p>The ter­ri­tory is brac­ing it­self for a gloomy win­ter sol­stice and Christ­mas, with of­fi­cials now un­der added pres­sure to do more to con­tain the rag­ing coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Dr Le­ung Chi Chiu of the Hong Kong Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that the sit­u­a­tion was “still crit­i­cal”.</p>
    <p>Daily cases might have dipped from over 100 to around 69 to 98 in the past six days, but most of them are lo­cal and of­fi­cials have no clue as to their source, at least for a sig­nif­i­cant pro­por­tion of them.</p>
    <p>More than 1,300 new cases of Covid-19 were recorded in the first two weeks of this month. Of these, more than 1,200 were lo­cal cases and 34 per cent have not been traced to a source.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong recorded 82 con­firmed cases yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing 79 lo­cal cases of which 35 have un­known sources.</p>
    <p>This brings the tally for con­firmed cases to just over 7,800, in­clud­ing 123 deaths.</p>
    <p>This week alone, six pa­tients aged be­tween 49 and 79 have died, prompt­ing ex­perts and of­fi­cials, in­clud­ing Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam, to urge the pub­lic to stay home, and warn the younger pop­u­la­tion against be­ing com­pla­cent.</p>
    <p>At yes­ter­day’s daily brief­ing, Dr Linda Yu of the Hospi­tal Au­thor­ity high­lighted that more pa­tients are now in crit­i­cal con­di­tion in a shorter span of time. She added that 70 per cent of in­ten­sive care unit beds are oc­cu­pied.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials are deal­ing with out­breaks linked to a Tai Po dor­mi­tory for for­eign do­mes­tic helpers and pub­lic hous­ing es­tates in Wong Tai Sin and Ngau Chi Wan.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple who live in or have vis­ited these build­ings have been urged to take the free tests.</p>
    <p>For­eign do­mes­tic helpers serve some 400,000 house­holds in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Dr Le­ung, an in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert, said: “With emerg­ing out­breaks in­volv­ing dif­fer­ent high­risk set­tings, in­clud­ing in­side multi-storey build­ings and poorly reg­u­lated hos­tels for for­eign do­mes­tic helpers, there is no room for com­pla­cency.”</p>
    <p>He added that colder weather in the com­ing fes­tive pe­riod and the in­flux of re­turnees from Bri­tain and other ar­eas with wors­en­ing Covid-19 out­breaks re­main ma­jor chal­lenges for the city.</p>
    <p>Chair­man of the Hong Kong Em­ploy­ment Agen­cies As­so­ci­a­tion Cheung Kit Man told pub­lic broad­caster RTHK yes­ter­day that ac­cord­ing to his es­ti­mates, there ex­ist about 300 un­li­censed dor­mi­to­ries for do­mes­tic helpers.</p>
    <p>It would be dif­fi­cult for the author­i­ties to check who had stayed in these dor­mi­to­ries as there was no record, he said, ad­ding that some helpers were al­lowed on their rest day to spend the night out­side their em­ploy­ers’ homes.</p>
    <p>But gov­ern­ment ad­viser and res­pi­ra­tory medicine pro­fes­sor David Hui told RTHK on Tues­day that there are fewer peo­ple out on the streets and he ex­pects the daily in­fec­tion rate to de­cline around Christ­mas as the ef­fects of tight­ened rules start to show.</p>
    <p>Last week, of­fi­cials re­in­stated some of the strictest mea­sures – last rolled out four months ago – to gain con­trol of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>For two weeks till Dec 23, there will be no dine-in ser­vices be­tween 6pm and 4.59am. Busi­nesses such as gyms, sports cen­tres, and beauty and mas­sage par­lours have also been forced to close, along with an ear­lier or­der for bars and pubs to shut.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam has an­nounced that the gov­ern­ment will ask the Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil to ap­prove be­fore Christ­mas a fourth round of antiepi­demic re­lief funds for busi­nesses that are hard­est hit.</p>
    <p>Dr Le­ung Chi Chiu of the Hong Kong Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion told The Straits Times that the sit­u­a­tion was “still crit­i­cal”. Daily cases might have dipped from over 100 to around 69 to 98 in the past six days, but most of them are lo­cal and of­fi­cials have no clue as to their source, at least for a sig­nif­i­cant pro­por­tion of them.</p>
