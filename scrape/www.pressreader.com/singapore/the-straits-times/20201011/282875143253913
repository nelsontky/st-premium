    <p>There is a spe­cial fund that is safe as houses while pay­ing a guar­an­teed an­nual re­turn of 4 per cent, even as the pan­demic con­tin­ues to rav­age the global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>What’s more, your money will be pro­tected even if things get worse, and you will not lose a cent. So if you park $100,000 there, you will see $104,000 in the ac­count a year later.</p>
    <p>If you think this is all a bit pie in the sky, use your SingPass to log in and start putting money into the fund right af­ter read­ing this.</p>
    <p>There is one catch, though – as it is such a great deal, the of­fer is open to only Sin­ga­pore­ans and long-term res­i­dents, and you can put in only up to $181,000 this year if you are be­low 55. Even at this amount, the an­nual re­turn is more than $7,200.</p>
    <p>If you are 55 and above, you can still top it up to the max­i­mum of $271,500 and get more re­turns from 65 – about $2,200 a month for life.</p>
    <p>There is a good rea­son why the CPF Spe­cial Ac­count (SA) is so named, and you would do well to make bet­ter use of it to grow your spare cash, given the dis­mally low in­ter­est rates on of­fer else­where.</p>
    <p>Fixed de­posit rates for most banks are pegged at the re­cent lows of be­tween 0.3 per cent and 0.6 per cent. DBS Bank stands out with an of­fer of 1.3 per cent for 18 months, but only for sums be­low $20,000.</p>
    <p>If you have cash to spare and are look­ing for ways to make bet­ter use of it, here are a few pru­dent steps to con­sider.</p>
    <p>Make bet­ter use of CPF</p>
    <p>Ev­ery time the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) is men­tioned, some self-pro­claimed “savvy” in­vestors will roll their eyes and view such ad­vice as govern­ment pro­pa­ganda to stop cit­i­zens from with­draw­ing their money.</p>
    <p>In the same vein, these in­vestors will also put down the guar­an­teed 4 per cent re­turn as “not sus­tain­able”, not­ing that all gov­ern­mentlinked in­vest­ment en­ti­ties are fac­ing tremen­dous head­winds in this cli­mate.</p>
    <p>But those who make this claim for­get one im­por­tant fact – un­like pri­vate in­vest­ment com­pa­nies, the Sin­ga­pore Govern­ment is not in the busi­ness of making prof­its out of its cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>Just like how it is shelling out $100 bil­lion to help tide Sin­ga­pore­ans over the pan­demic with­out ask­ing for re­turns, there is no rea­son for the Govern­ment to cut back on the high in­ter­est rates for CPF as the fund is aimed at help­ing us live well in old age.</p>
    <p>If more Sin­ga­pore­ans know how to make bet­ter use of CPF to save enough for them­selves, the Govern­ment will have fewer peo­ple to worry about. It will ac­tu­ally be money well spent if the CPF can help the vast majority of fu­ture se­niors be self-suf­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>So how not to lose out on this deal?</p>
    <p>1. Log in to the “my CPF” por­tal and check if you have ex­ceeded the $181,000 mark for your SA</p>
    <p>If you have not ex­ceeded it, you can im­me­di­ately top up your SA to that sum. If you have ex­ceeded it, check the SAs of your spouse and chil­dren and top up for them.</p>
    <p>Yes, even ba­bies have CPF ac­counts that are au­to­mat­i­cally cre­ated for them at birth, and you can help them to save from an early age.</p>
    <p>If you put in gen­er­ous sums for them when they are tod­dlers, they will thank you when they be­come adults, be­cause the com­pound­ing re­turns can grow their ac­counts into hun­dreds of thou­sands of dol­lars.</p>
    <p>There is an ex­tra bonus for topping up SAs – you en­joy tax re­lief on up to $14,000 of top-ups in the fol­low­ing year.</p>
    <p>2. Don’t worry if you have missed the SA boat</p>
    <p>If you used your CPF money to pay for your home, you can move funds back to your Or­di­nary Ac­count (OA) and earn 2.5 per cent on them.</p>
    <p>To see if you are el­i­gi­ble, go to “My Re­quests” in the CPF por­tal, check un­der the prop­erty tab and see how much money you can “re­fund” to your own ac­count.</p>
    <p>Take spe­cial note if you are be­tween 50 and 55 years old: The money that you put in will be avail­able to you af­ter 55, when the nec­es­sary amount has been set aside for your re­tire­ment un­der CPF Life.</p>
    <p>So you can view this as park­ing your ex­tra cash in a “fixed de­posit ac­count” – one with an in­ter­est rate about five times bet­ter than what is of­fered by banks.</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple still do not know that af­ter 55, the CPF OA ac­tu­ally op­er­ates like your per­sonal sav­ings ac­count, with a ma­jor ex­cep­tion – it earns 2.5 per cent with no lock­down pe­riod. The only down­side is that you can only with­draw money from it and can­not put any in, un­less you make use of the “re­fund prop­erty loan” op­tion.</p>
    <p>You can start to re­fund the prop­erty loan bit by bit, in what­ever sums you de­sire, as fre­quently as you want, up to the max­i­mum amount stip­u­lated in that op­tion.</p>
    <p>Use cash to pay off your hous­ing loan and debts</p>
    <p>If you have spare cash, con­sider pay­ing off as much of your loans as you can.</p>
    <p>Start with credit card debt, which has the high­est rate. Next will be your hous­ing loan – check with your bank how you can make grad­ual lump-sum pay­ments to shorten the loan ten­ure.</p>
    <p>I know some peo­ple like to keep a lot of spare cash in fixed deposits for a rainy day even though they still have a hous­ing loan to pay.</p>
    <p>Since the sav­ings rate is so low now, it makes more sense to use some of this cash to pay off the hous­ing loan in lump sums, as its rates are still about three times higher than what you get from fixed deposits.</p>
    <p>Any loan is a drain on your nest egg; the sooner you pay it off, the faster your sav­ings can grow. At the very least, try to cut back on CPF money used to pay the loan each month.</p>
    <p>Again, you can ad­just this eas­ily on the CPF por­tal. Use more cash to pay the mort­gage be­cause it does not make sense to use CPF, which earns in­ter­est of 2.5 per cent, to pay off loans that cost 1.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>Build up your in­vest­ment fire­power</p>
    <p>Due to the fear of miss­ing out, many peo­ple are anx­ious to in­vest their dis­pos­able cash as it is earn­ing very low in­ter­est in their bank ac­counts.</p>
    <p>If you want to do this, ex­er­cise cau­tion be­cause the pan­demic is still wreak­ing havoc in many coun­tries and the coast is still far from clear.</p>
    <p>Such un­cer­tainty and volatil­ity mean there is a chance that you may end up suf­fer­ing losses on the prin­ci­pal in­vest­ment sum in­stead of making a profit.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, if you are bet­ting $100,000 on a stock to rise by 10 per cent, you are ac­tu­ally stak­ing the whole amount for the hope of making $10,000.</p>
    <p>While the chance of los­ing the whole sum is low un­less you dab­ble in high-risk in­stru­ments, you still have to brace your­self for pos­si­ble losses.</p>
    <p>What about in­vest­ing in prop­erty? The risk is far lower than stocks but the out­lay is far higher. Also, the price of real es­tate here has not re­ally fallen like it did in past re­ces­sions, which means the chances of a profit due to price hikes will not be high in the near term.</p>
    <p>So what can you do? If you are feel­ing fid­gety, you can still make bets on blue-chip stocks in smaller tranches so that you can en­joy the up­sides if they hap­pen, while re­duc­ing the risks with your cal­cu­lated ap­proach.</p>
    <p>Al­ter­na­tively, you can be the wise gen­eral who strate­gi­cally con­serves fire­power and waits on the side­lines un­til the good times are back. While you may miss the ini­tial market boom, at least you will have the money to ride the sub­se­quent gains.</p>
    <p>Do not make the same mis­takes of past down­turns, when some peo­ple could only hope for their bat­tered in­vest­ment to re­cover af­ter they ex­pended their re­sources early in the game.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, making less money is bet­ter than los­ing a bit of your nest egg.</p>
