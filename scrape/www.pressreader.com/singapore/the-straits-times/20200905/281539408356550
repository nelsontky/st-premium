    <p>At 33 years old and af­ter two hip op­er­a­tions, Andy Murray (right) knows that it will be “ex­tremely dif­fi­cult” to add to his three Grand Slam ti­tles. But af­ter los­ing in the US Open se­cond round to Cana­dian Felix Auger-Alias­sime, the Bri­tish for­mer world No. 1 said that he is de­ter­mined to re­build his form in the next few months.</p>
    <p>NEW YORK • Build­ing the stamina to con­sis­tently sur­vive the rigours of five-set matches will top the 33-year-old Andy Murray’s agenda as the for­mer US Open cham­pion, who has un­der­gone two hip op­er­a­tions, plots the re­vival of his ca­reer.</p>
    <p>Play­ing his first Grand Slam sin­gles match since the 2019 Aus­tralian Open, when there was talk of him re­tir­ing, the Scot pro­duced an as­ton­ish­ing fight­back from two sets down to de­feat Ja­pan’s Yoshi­hito Nish­ioka in 4hr 39min in his open­ing round.</p>
    <p>But that match seemed to take a toll on him as he bowed out against Cana­dian Felix Auger-Alias­sime 6-2, 6-3, 6-4 on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“The more tour­na­ments that you play, the more matches that you play, you build up that sort of ro­bust­ness in your body which right now I don’t re­ally have,” said Murray, who won his first Grand Slam ti­tle at Flush­ing Mead­ows in 2012.</p>
    <p>“So that’s some­thing that I’ll need to build up over the next few months and hope­fully be­gin­ning of next year. If I can stay healthy, I will be bet­ter able to back up dif­fi­cult phys­i­cal ef­forts.”</p>
    <p>He was un­able to re­peat his firstround hero­ics against the big-serv­ing 21st-ranked Auger-Alias­sime, who dom­i­nated from start to fin­ish.</p>
    <p>The Cana­dian smashed 24 aces and 52 win­ners in a one-sided af­fair. Murray mus­tered just two aces and nine win­ners.</p>
    <p>“He’s a big guy. He takes the ball on. There’s ob­vi­ously fairly quick con­di­tions here, as well,” said Murray. “Maybe served a lit­tle bit bet­ter tonight than he had in the last cou­ple of weeks, which helped.”</p>
    <p>The Scot ar­rived for the US Open tune-up at the West­ern & South­ern Open hav­ing not played a pro­fes­sional match since the Davis Cup Fi­nals in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>He picked up back-to-back wins over Frances Ti­afoe and world No. 7 Alexan­der Zverev, but his level dropped against Mi­los Raonic in the round-of-16 loss.</p>
    <p>“I felt like I played some good stuff at times, but it was quite up and down. I would like to play con­sis­tently bet­ter ten­nis,” he said.</p>
    <p>“If you aren’t play­ing at a high level con­sis­tently, then you will play longer matches be­cause you’re hav­ing dips.”</p>
    <p>With re­cent in­jury strug­gles, he also ac­cepted it would be “ex­tremely dif­fi­cult” to add to his three Grand Slam ti­tles.</p>
    <p>But the 2013 and 2016 Wim­ble­don win­ner, who was renowned for his never-say-die at­ti­tude at the peak of his pow­ers, in­sists he is not ready to throw in the towel yet.</p>
    <p>“In terms of win­ning Grand Slams</p>
    <p>Above: Felix Auger-Alias­sime serv­ing dur­ing his se­cond-round match against Bri­tain’s Andy Murray. The Cana­dian smashed 24 aces and 52 win­ners in a 6-2, 6-3, 6-4 vic­tory. again, that’s go­ing to be ex­tremely dif­fi­cult to do. It was hard enough when I had two nor­mal hips. So it will be dif­fi­cult, but I’ll keep try­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Why not? Why shouldn’t I try my hard­est to do that? And if I don’t, that’s all right. But I might as well shoot for the stars.</p>
    <p>“And if I don’t – yeah, if I don’t get there, then that’s all right. But I’m try­ing my best to get the most out of what my body gives me now.”</p>
    <p>He added that he would also play in the re­ar­ranged French Open later this month.</p>
