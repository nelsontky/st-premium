    <p>The vac­uum left by Dyson has been filled. Hyundai Mo­tor will make elec­tric ve­hi­cles (EVs) at a plant in Jurong slated to be up and run­ning by 2022.</p>
    <p>The South Korean car­maker’s choice to pick Sin­ga­pore as a man­u­fac­tur­ing lo­ca­tion is an un­prece­dented one.</p>
    <p>“It is the first time we are pick­ing a coun­try which does not have a car man­u­fac­tur­ing in­dus­try,” an in­sider told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Mr Teo Hock Seng, ex­ec­u­tive chair­man of Hyundai dis­trib­u­tor Ko­moco Motors, said the man­u­fac­tur­ing of EVs here is a sig­nif­i­cant mile­stone. “For us, the most im­por­tant thing is Hyundai will be made in Sin­ga­pore,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that plans for the plant ger­mi­nated four years ago, dur­ing Ko­moco’s 30th an­niver­sary. Highrank­ing ex­ec­u­tives from Hyundai came and met Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try rep­re­sen­ta­tives.</p>
    <p>“They talked about au­ton­o­mous ve­hi­cles,” Mr Teo said, adding that the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board (EDB) then fol­lowed up, and “en­cour­aged Hyundai to in­vest in a smart fac­tory in Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>He said Ko­moco tar­gets to sell 5,000 to 6,000 of the 30,000 elec­tric cars made here a year, and Hyundai will ex­port the rest.</p>
    <p>Hyundai will start with an elec­tric com­pact cross­over, which sources say might be called the Ioniq 3.</p>
    <p>Ground­break­ing for the plant in Bulim Av­enue is slated for Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>The plant will be within a 28,000 sq m Hyundai Mo­bil­ity Global In­no­va­tion Cen­tre, which is a multi-func­tion fa­cil­ity that will carry out R&D and train­ing, among other things. Con­struc­tion was sup­posed to have started in May, but has been de­layed by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The fa­cil­ity will be a mod­ern com­plex with swathes of so­lar pan­els, and will be a test-bed for highly au­to­mated, data-driven “smart man­u­fac­tur­ing”.</p>
    <p>A Hyundai Mo­tor spokesman said: “When re­alised, Hyundai’s new man­u­fac­tur­ing plat­form will help make au­to­mo­tive plants safer and greatly di­min­ish the phys­i­cal bur­den for work­ers, us­ing man­power only where nec­es­sary.”</p>
    <p>The fa­cil­ity will also carry out ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence re­search and in­vest­ment ac­tiv­i­ties, and trial new mo­bil­ity ser­vices. Hyundai is also ex­pected to team up with lo­cal part­ners such as uni­ver­si­ties to carry out hy­dro­gen fuel cell and au­ton­o­mous driv­ing re­search.</p>
    <p>With­out be­ing spe­cific, the spokesman said the fa­cil­ity will cre­ate “hun­dreds of jobs”.</p>
    <p>He would not re­veal the in­vest­ment sum.</p>
    <p>EDB ex­ec­u­tive vice-pres­i­dent Tan Kong Hwee said: “Tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vance­ments are trans­form­ing the mo­bil­ity sec­tor with an in­crease in adop­tion of elec­tric, con­nected and au­ton­o­mous ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>“At­tract­ing qual­ity in­vest­ments aris­ing from these emerg­ing trends is part of our strat­egy to grow Sin­ga­pore’s mo­bil­ity ecosys­tem. This will not only cre­ate ex­cit­ing j ob op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans, but also ben­e­fit ad­ja­cent in­dus­tries which are al­ready wellestab­lished here.”</p>
    <p>This week, Hyundai an­nounced that it will launch a range of nu­mer­i­cally named EVs un­der the Ioniq brand name.</p>
    <p>The first will be the Ioniq 5, a mid­size cross­over based on the con­cept 45. It will launch early next year.</p>
    <p>In March 2022, the Ioniq 6 sedan, which is based on the Prophecy con­cept, will be un­veiled, fol­lowed by the Ioniq 7, a large sport util­ity ve­hi­cle, in early 2024.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore-made car is ex­pected to be the yet-to-be-an­nounced Ioniq 3. More details are ex­pected in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish home ap­pli­ance maker Dyson an­nounced in Oc­to­ber 2018 that it would make elec­tric cars in Sin­ga­pore, only to pull the plug on the ven­ture a year later.</p>
    <p>De­spite Sin­ga­pore’s con­tin­u­ing mea­sures to curb its ve­hi­cle pop­u­la­tion, Mr Teo Hock Seng, ex­ec­u­tive chair­man of di­ver­si­fied mo­tor group Ko­moco Hold­ings, does not be­lieve the car busi­ness is a sun­set in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Says the 74-year-old: “Sun­set or sunrise, the stay­ers will fight and will re­main. I don’t think the Gov­ern­ment can say ‘no more cars on the road’. They can try, but they will get a lot of brick­bats.</p>
    <p>“The Gov­ern­ment said 14 per cent of space is de­voted to roads. But they for­get they are build­ing more 40-storey build­ings, and ev­ery­one in them wants a car.</p>
    <p>“All the higher-end for­eign ex­ec­u­tives want cars.”</p>
    <p>In fact, he reck­ons that as long as “there are roads, and peo­ple are not poor, they will still want pri­vate car own­er­ship”.</p>
    <p>Mr Teo’s own jour­ney with the mo­tor trade started “by ac­ci­dent”.</p>
    <p>It hap­pened in 1985, when he was work­ing for prop­erty de­vel­oper Ong Beng Seng’s ho­tel di­vi­sion, and was in South Korea look­ing to buy a ho­tel.</p>
    <p>While there, he was asked to help re­tailer Jopie Ong (the Metro boss who died in 2016) ne­go­ti­ate a deal­er­ship con­tract with Hyundai Mo­tor. They clinched the fran­chise and set up Ko­moco.</p>
    <p>The two Ongs each held 50 per cent of Ko­moco, but they gave Mr Teo 5 per cent after the first year, and kept their shares at 47.5 per cent each.</p>
    <p>Ko­moco started in 1986 with one sec­re­tary, one ac­coun­tant, eight sales­men and a bor­rowed type­writer. “I was sup­posed to be on loan for one year, to get the busi­ness run­ning,” Mr Teo re­calls.</p>
    <p>But Ko­moco did so well that he stayed on. Hyundai sales in­creased more than five­fold to 1,500 units in 1987, and by al­most an­other three­fold to 4,238 in 1988 – the year Ko­moco clinched the World Dis­trib­u­tor of the Year award from the Korean car­maker.</p>
    <p>It re­peated the feat in 2000.</p>
    <p>Over the years, the group added other fran­chises to its sta­ble. Now, its re­tail net­work has soared to 16 in Sin­ga­pore and China.</p>
    <p>Its fran­chises in­clude Har­ley-David­son, Jeep, Fer­rari, Maserati and Alfa Romeo (China).</p>
    <p>Re­flect­ing on the great strides that Hyundai has made, Mr Teo says: “It started as an in­ex­pen­sive car, and over time, its re­li­a­bil­ity im­proved a lot.</p>
    <p>“In after-sales, I don’t have peo­ple ring­ing me up to scold me like in the early days.”</p>
    <p>When changes in the mar­ket led to a drop in pri­vate car sales, Ko­moco clinched fleet sales from taxi op­er­a­tors. Since 2007, fleet sales have helped Ko­moco main­tain its mar­ket share.</p>
    <p>“Mag­i­cally, we made it,” Mr Teo adds.</p>
    <p>But there were ma­jor chal­lenges along the way.</p>
    <p>The worst was dur­ing the start of the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis in 1997, when Hyundai car sales plunged to 605 units – less than 30 per cent of Ko­moco’s av­er­age in the pre­vi­ous 10 years. The com­pany re­ported a loss of $1.7 mil­lion for the year ended Dec 31, 1997.</p>
    <p>Not long after, there was talk of the share­hold­ers want­ing to sell the busi­ness or di­lute their stakes.</p>
    <p>Mr Teo says: “We had of­fers, but none of them worked out.”</p>
    <p>One of the suit­ors was trans­port op­er­a­tor Tibs, which re­port­edly wanted to add car dis­tri­bu­tion to its taxi and bus units. “There was some dis­cus­sion, but in the end, it fiz­zled out,” Mr Teo adds.</p>
    <p>Tibs was even­tu­ally taken over by SMRT. And Mr Jopie Ong sold part of his stake to Mr Ong Beng Seng.</p>
    <p>Mr Teo dis­closes that “even now, we have of­fers”. But he says the com­pany is strong fi­nan­cially. “We have noth­ing on credit. We re­main cash pos­i­tive.”</p>
    <p>Latest fig­ures from the Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Au­thor­ity show Ko­moco Hold­ings posted an after-tax profit of $24.9 mil­lion for fi­nan­cial year 2018, up from $7.7 mil­lion in 2017.</p>
    <p>The group has aban­doned its aim of a pub­lic list­ing, some­thing it had con­sid­ered in the 1990s.</p>
    <p>“We do not need the cash,” Mr Teo says. “The other part about list­ing is that it’s not so easy. There will be many ques­tions asked. If your pro­jec­tion is out, you’re in trou­ble.”</p>
    <p>He does not rule out ac­quir­ing new fran­chises, even if not all the brands ac­quired after Hyundai had proven to be as prof­itable.</p>
    <p>In fact, he sold off a Mercedes-Benz deal­er­ship in Me­laka last De­cem­ber be­cause it was not mak­ing money.</p>
    <p>“But there may be things up for of­fer post-Covid-19. You never know,” he says. “We’re open-minded, but we have to be pru­dent.”</p>
    <p>Among pri­vately owned mo­tor com­pa­nies here, Ko­moco ranks along­side big­ger play­ers such as Mr Kar­sono Kwee’s Eurokars Group, and Wearnes Au­to­mo­tive.</p>
    <p>After 35 years, Mr Teo re­mains hands-on. “I am get­ting younger,” he says with a smile. “I was not well four years ago, but I’ve re­cov­ered. I have a very good team here, and we are fo­cused on what we do.”</p>
    <p>Even though daugh­ter Tracy, 42, is in the busi­ness (as group mar­ket­ing di­rec­tor), he says: “You can­not be fam­ily in this game – you have to find pro­fes­sion­als.”</p>
    <p>Mr Teo’s other pas­sions are foot­ball and rugby. He is one of the vi­cepres­i­dents of the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore, and he watches in­ter­na­tional rugby matches.</p>
    <p>He will have been mar­ried for 50 years in Novem­ber. “I was hop­ing to hold a party, but I need to en­sure so­cial dis­tanc­ing, so I don’t know what to do,” he says with a laugh.</p>
    <p>His wife Kather­ine, 75, a house­wife, prefers to stay out of the lime­light.</p>
    <p>Be­sides Tracy, the cou­ple have two sons. Trevor, 49, used to work for a Ja­panese casino in the Philip­pines, but is “now job­less be­cause of Covid-19”. Ter­ence, 46, has his own in­vest­ment com­pany. “He used to be a pri­vate banker,” Mr Teo adds.</p>
    <p>His three chil­dren have made him a grand­fa­ther of five: two boys and three girls, whose ages range from three to 23.</p>
    <p>“They’re all here with me in Sin­ga­pore,” he adds, beam­ing with pride.</p>
    <p>Sun­set or sunrise, the stay­ers will fight and will re­main. I don’t think the Gov­ern­ment can say ‘no more cars on the road’... The Gov­ern­ment said 14 per cent of space is de­voted to roads. But they for­get they are build­ing more 40-storey build­ings, and ev­ery­one in them wants a car. All the higher-end for­eign ex­ec­u­tives want cars.</p>
