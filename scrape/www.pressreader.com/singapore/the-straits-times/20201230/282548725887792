    <p>THE­ATRE THE MRBROWN SHOW LIVE! Sifa v2.020 KC Arts Cen­tre/Last Fri­day</p>
    <p>After a year in which the arts com­mu­nity was forced to pivot to dig­i­tal plat­forms, the arts cal­en­dar closed with a show that mi­grated in the op­po­site di­rec­tion – from dig­i­tal origins to live the­atre.</p>
    <p>The mrbrown show Live!, part of the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Fes­ti­val of Arts’ Sifa v2.020, proved that just as live the­atre does not translate well to dig­i­tal me­dia, social me­dia con­tent can­not sur­vive the rigours of the stage.</p>
    <p>Blog­ger-co­me­dian mrbrown, a.k.a. Lee Kin Mun, and his team worked hard for the 1hr 40min show. But the pro­duc­tion was a patchy af­fair which begged for proper dra­maturgy.</p>
    <p>There was some at­tempt at an over­ar­ch­ing nar­ra­tive, based on mrbrown’s jour­ney as an early en­trant into the bl­o­go­sphere to his cur­rent sta­tus as hu­mor­ous gad­fly across mul­ti­ple social me­dia plat­forms. But this was fit­fully done.</p>
    <p>The gawky am­a­teur­ish tone might have been for­given if the show had more of the satir­i­cal bite and ram­bunc­tious en­ergy that pow­ers some of mrbrown’s best videos. But on stage, the mu­si­cal num­bers were oddly leaden.</p>
    <p>It did not help that the first num­ber was a stodgy af­fair with a dully repet­i­tive cho­rus about “zhng my car”, which seemed de­signed to shoe­horn another long­time mrbrown col­lab­o­ra­tor, Ben­jamin “Mr Miyagi” Lee, into the show.</p>
    <p>What works on­line for mrbrown is the hit-and-run na­ture of his videos, which cap­i­talise on a quick turn­around on the hot-but­ton is­sues of the day. A stage show, even in a re­vue for­mat, needs craft­ing, pac­ing and stamina.</p>
    <p>The pac­ing here was not helped by the bits in which poet and reg­u­lar mrbrown col­lab­o­ra­tor Marc Nair re­cited spo­ken-word pieces. The abrupt lurch in tone killed what lit­tle mo­men­tum had built up. Not that there were that many belly laughs to be had – more like a chuckle or two.</p>
    <p>There were some ten­der mo­ments in the sec­ond half when mrbrown shared sto­ries about his fam­ily’s strug­gle to cope with an autis­tic daugh­ter, Faith. And the night ended on a slightly brighter note with a few Christ­mas-carol spoofs, which better matched the tone of ir­rev­er­ent fun most peo­ple as­so­ci­ate with his work.</p>
    <p>White Christ­mas got re­made as Flight Christ­mas: “I’m dream­ing of a flight this Christ­mas, where the food is taste­less, chil­dren don’t lis­ten and some­times the flight is de­layed.”</p>
    <p>Santa Claus Is Com­ing To Town be­came “Santa Claus is also on­line” and All I Want For Christ­mas, “Don’t want quar­an­tine/Some­one quickly give me vac­cine”.</p>
    <p>While these bits were mildly en­ter­tain­ing, one could not help but think that Broad­way Beng or Dim Sum Dol­lies would have done it better for the stage.</p>
