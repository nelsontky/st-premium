    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Swim­ming As­so­ci­a­tion has ap­pointed Be­laru­sian Anas­ta­sia Gout­seva as its new artis­tic swim­ming head coach. The 45-year-old had pre­vi­ously worked with the Cana­dian and Greek na­tional teams and re­places Venezue­lan Geral­dine Nar­vaez, whose two-year con­tract ended last month.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing made their mark in South­east Asia by top­ping the medal ta­ble at the 2015 and 2017 SEA Games, Sin­ga­pore’s artis­tic swim­ming team are aim­ing to shine on an even big­ger stage next year.</p>
    <p>Artis­tic swim­ming duet Deb­bie Soh and Miya Yong have set their sights on be­com­ing the first Sin­ga­pore­ans in the dis­ci­pline to qual­ify for the Olympic Games in Tokyo, while the team are aim­ing to com­pete at the 2022 Asian Games. And they will be count­ing on newly ap­pointed head coach Anas­ta­sia Gout­seva to help them achieve their goals.</p>
    <p>The 45-year-old Be­laru­sian was an­nounced as the new artis­tic swim­ming head coach by the Sin­ga­pore Swim­ming As­so­ci­a­tion (SSA) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She re­places Venezue­lan Geral­dine Nar­vaez, whose two-year deal ended last month.</p>
    <p>The ex-artis­tic swim­mer shares a con­nec­tion with the Sin­ga­pore team as she had pre­vi­ously worked with their for­mer con­sul­tant coach, Julie Sauve who died in April, when the duo were coach­ing the Cana­dian na­tional team.</p>
    <p>Soh, who has won five SEA Games gold medals, noted Sauve had pre­vi­ously “spo­ken highly” of Gout­seva.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore Julie left us, she spoke of a coach who had been her as­sis­tant for six years un­der the Cana­dian Olympic team,” said the 22-yearold. “We didn’t know who it was yet</p>
    <p>OP­TI­MISTIC OUT­LOOK</p>
    <p>at that time, but I do know that Anas­ta­sia was spo­ken highly of by Julie.</p>
    <p>“With how Julie touched our lives, we trust in the process and will work hard to achieve our Olympic dreams to hon­our Julie’s legacy and her be­lief that we have the abil­ity to be the first Sin­ga­porean artis­tic swim­mers to make it (to the Olympics).”</p>
    <p>A for­mer ju­nior ath­lete, Gout­seva rep­re­sented the Soviet Union from 1982 to 1991. She later com­peted for Belarus at the Fina world cham­pi­onships and Euro­pean cham­pi­onships from 1991 to 1998.</p>
    <p>As a coach, she worked with the</p>
    <p>Cana­di­ans from 2010 to 2016, lead­ing t h e d u e t o f Ma r i e - P i e r Boudreau Gagnon and Elise Mar­cotte and the team to fourth-placed fin­ishes at the 2012 Olympics.</p>
    <p>Be­fore that stint, she had also coached the Greek na­tional team from 2005 to 2009.</p>
    <p>Gout­seva’s first task will be to help the team re­tain their top po­si­tion in the re­gion if the dis­ci­pline makes a re­turn to the Hanoi SEA Games next year. Artis­tic swim­ming was omit­ted from the SEA Games sched­ule in the Philip­pines last year.</p>
    <p>Ariel Sng, who com­petes in the team event, said: “We are look­ing for­ward to work­ing with Anas­ta­sia. With her wealth of ex­pe­ri­ence in the sport, we hope that to­gether, Sin­ga­pore artis­tic swim­ming will con­tinue to reach new heights and re­tain its po­si­tion as the top artis­tic swim­ming coun­try in the re­gion.”</p>
    <p>SSA vice-pres­i­dent of artis­tic swim­ming, Steve Chew, said yes­ter­day: “Anas­ta­sia, with her wealth of ex­pe­ri­ence coach­ing Olympic teams and a proven track record at in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tions, will build on this and take Sin­ga­pore artis­tic swim­ming to even greater heights.”</p>

    <p>new heights.</p>
