    <p>LON­DON • Most of Europe is un­der lockdown again as the con­ti­nent is bat­tling a sec­ond wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions and the ris­ing cases among foot­ballers is mir­ror­ing the wors­en­ing sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The Premier League said on Mon­day that 16 peo­ple had re­turned pos­i­tive re­sults in its lat­est round of Covid-19 tests con­ducted on play­ers and staff last week, the high­est num­ber of cases in a sin­gle round since the new sea­son be­gan in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>“The Premier League can to­day con­firm that be­tween Mon­day Nov 9 and Sun­day Nov 15, 1,207 play­ers and club staff were tested for Covid-19. Of th­ese, there were 16 new pos­i­tive tests,” a state­ment read, adding that they will have to self-iso­late for 10 days.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 68 peo­ple have tested pos­i­tive for the virus in 11 rounds of test­ing this sea­son but only once has the dou­ble-fig­ure mark been hit be­fore.</p>
    <p>While foot­ballers are kept in a semi-bub­ble ahead of do­mes­tic and Euro­pean com­pe­ti­tions, it is not the same dur­ing the in­ter­na­tional break due to the trav­el­ling re­quired.</p>
    <p>Atletico Madrid’s Luis Suarez on Mon­day be­came the lat­est high­pro­file player to get in­fected on in­ter­na­tional duty, rul­ing him out of his first La Liga re­union with for­mer club Barcelona, who he ac­ri­mo­niously left in the sum­mer, on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old was also un­able to play in their World Cup qual­i­fier against Brazil this morn­ing, although the Uruguayan Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion said that he was “in good health” and had been put in quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Premier League clubs Tot­ten­ham and Arse­nal also suf­fered a blow af­ter Ire­land de­fender Matt Do­herty and Egypt mid­fielder Mo­hamed El­neny were both hit by Covid-19 while on in­ter­na­tional duty.</p>
    <p>The Pharaohs said in a state­ment on their web­site on Mon­day that El­neny had re­turned a pos­i­tive test upon ar­rival in Togo for Tues­day’s Africa Cup of Na­tions qual­i­fier, rul­ing him out of the game. The team added he did not present any symp­toms and was iso­lat­ing, with the 28-year-old set to miss Arse­nal’s league game at Leeds on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>It came on the heels of com­pa­triot Mo­hamed Salah’s pos­i­tive test last week and the for­ward is ex­pected to be ab­sent when Liver­pool host league lead­ers Le­ices­ter the same day.</p>
    <p>Spurs also ex­pe­ri­enced frus­tra­tion as the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Ire­land con­firmed that Do­herty had come down with the virus, tak­ing him out of con­tention for their fi­nal Na­tions League game at home to Bul­garia to­day.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old will not be avail­able as Manch­ester City visit north Lon­don on Satur­day, lead­ing his club man­ager Jose Mour­inho to ex­press his frus­tra­tion on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>“Amaz­ing week of foot­ball. Great emo­tions in the na­tional team matches, su­perb friendlies and to­tal safety,” he wrote sar­cas­ti­cally.</p>
    <p>“Covid test re­sults af­ter matches been played, ran­domers running on the pitch while team ses­sions are tak­ing place and much more.”</p>
