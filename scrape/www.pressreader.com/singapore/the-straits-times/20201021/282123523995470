    <p>A woman re­peat­edly abused her maid for close to five years, us­ing house­hold items like a me­tal la­dle, a clay cup and a high-heeled shoe to as­sault the woman.</p>
    <p>On one oc­ca­sion, Tan Bee Kim, 55, was so in­censed that her maid, Ms Zeny Aquino Landin­gin, had used a smaller la­dle to serve her food that she hit the woman on the head and fore­head with the uten­sil, re­sult­ing in two haematomas, or lo­calised bleed­ing out­side of the blood ves­sels, on the maid’s head.</p>
    <p>That was the last straw for the 48-year-old Filip­ina, who re­ported Tan to the po­lice.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Tan was sen­tenced to six months’ jail. She had ear­lier pleaded guilty to one charge of vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing hurt. An­other 12 sim­i­lar charges were taken into con­sid­er­a­tion dur­ing her sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments show that the maid worked for Tan’s fam­ily from Septem­ber 2012 to March 25, 2018, when she re­ported Tan.</p>
    <p>She earned a monthly salary of $450, but Tan would deduct sums from that when­ever she spoiled or dam­aged items in the flat, court doc­u­ments stated.</p>
    <p>Tan re­peat­edly hit the maid, at times pinch­ing or slap­ping her with her hands or us­ing var­i­ous items.</p>
    <p>On March 24, 2018, the maid pre­pared and served Tan her din­ner in the liv­ing room.</p>
    <p>Half­way through din­ner, Tan asked the maid what la­dle she had used to serve her food.</p>
    <p>The maid re­trieved the la­dle from the kitchen and handed it to Tan.</p>
    <p>“The ac­cused, how­ever, told the vic­tim to come closer and she used a me­tal la­dle, which was meant for serv­ing soup, to hit the vic­tim two times on the left side of her head and once at her fore­head, in­tend­ing thereby to cause hurt to the vic­tim,” said deputy pub­lic pros­e­cu­tors Muhamad Imadud­dien and Tay Jia En in court pa­pers.</p>
    <p>The maid felt pain and swelling on her head. When the swelling per­sisted the next morn­ing, she lodged a po­lice re­port.</p>
    <p>In mit­i­ga­tion, Tan’s de­fence coun­sel, Mr Manoj Nand­wani, ar­gued that Tan should not be given the full brunt of pun­ish­ment as she had demon­strated re­morse and pleaded guilty to the charge very early on.</p>
    <p>He also con­tended that the vic­tim did not suf­fer psy­cho­log­i­cal harm from Tan’s acts, point­ing out that she could stand up to Tan and en­joyed a cer­tain de­gree of free­dom.</p>
    <p>How­ever, District Judge Christo­pher Tan said such fac­tors do not de­tract from the fact that the maid was sub­jected to re­peated abuse.</p>
    <p>There were “mul­ti­ple in­stances where the vic­tim tes­ti­fied to be­ing afraid”, said the judge, adding that the maid had also said that she was afraid of mak­ing a re­port.</p>
