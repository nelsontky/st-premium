    <p>Malaysia’s Plan­ta­tion, In­dus­tries and Com­modi­ties Min­is­ter Khairud­din Aman Razali is un­der fire after he failed to un­dergo manda­tory quar­an­tine fol­low­ing an over­seas trip last month.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion law­maker Teresa Kok from the Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party told Par­lia­ment on Tues­day that Mr Khairud­din, a law­maker from Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS), had re­turned from an un­of­fi­cial visit to Turkey on July 7, but was in Par­lia­ment on July 13.</p>
    <p>“Many Malaysians and for­eign­ers who re­turned from over­seas and tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 were still re­quired to un­dergo quar­an­tine for 14 days. Why is spe­cial treat­ment given for a Cabi­net min­is­ter?” Ms Kok said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In Malaysia, any­one re­turn­ing from over­seas must un­dergo a manda­tory 14-day quar­an­tine. Re­turnees are tested on ar­rival, and again in two weeks.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple have tested neg­a­tive but were found pos­i­tive a few days later. This is why the 14-day quar­an­tine rule must be obeyed by every­one, in­clud­ing the min­is­ter,” said Ms Kok, adding that Mr Khairud­din’s pres­ence at Par­lia­ment and meet­ings had put oth­ers at risk.</p>
    <p>“The court must take ac­tion against him to prove that the NSC (Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil) does not prac­tise dou­ble stan­dards in terms of en­force­ment to­wards Covid-19 of­fences.”</p>
    <p>A source close to Mr Khairud­din told The Straits Times that the min­is­ter had un­der­gone a Covid-19 test upon ar­rival at the Kuala Lumpur In­ter­na­tional Air­port on July 7 which was neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>“He had also un­der­gone a se­cond test three days be­fore the July 13 par­lia­men­tary ses­sion which was neg­a­tive,” said the source.</p>
    <p>The July 13 ses­sion wit­nessed a key vote to re­move the pre­vi­ous Speaker, and the rul­ing Perikatan Na­sional govern­ment, with its ra­zor-thin ma­jor­ity, won the vote 111-109.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter’s fail­ure to un­dergo quar­an­tine has raised ques­tions among ne­ti­zens over dou­ble stan­dards, as or­di­nary Malaysians who broke quar­an­tine or­ders have been fined and even jailed.</p>
    <p>Just five days ago, a se­nior cit­i­zen was jailed a day and fined RM8,000 (S$2,600) for flout­ing her quar­an­tine or­der.</p>
    <p>Six days ago, an In­dian na­tional with Malaysian per­ma­nent res­i­dency was jailed five months and fined RM12,000 for ven­tur­ing out dur­ing his stay-home or­der.</p>
    <p>He had tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 upon re­turn­ing from In­dia but a re­peat test found him pos­i­tive, creat­ing the Si­va­gangga clus­ter which crossed state bor­ders and left over 40 peo­ple in­fected.</p>
    <p>In April, there was public back­lash after Deputy Health Min­is­ter Noor Azmi Ghaz­ali and a Perak state exco mem­ber were let off with a fine of RM1,000 each for at­tend­ing a so­cial gath­er­ing dur­ing Malaysia’s par­tial shut­down, while a sin­gle mother was sen­tenced to 30 days’ jail for fail­ing to obey the Move­ment Con­trol Or­der (MCO).</p>
    <p>Her sen­tence was re­duced to a RM1,000 fine on ap­peal, after she had spent eight days in prison.</p>
