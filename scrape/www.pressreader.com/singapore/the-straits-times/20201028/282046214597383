    <p>Sin­ga­pore has taken another step in its move to re­duce the car­bon foot­print of pub­lic trans­port, with the de­ploy­ment of the first 10 fully elec­tric dou­ble-decker buses yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The buses will ply the roads on ser­vice 983 in Choa Chu Kang, ser­vice 189 in Bukit Ba­tok and Cle­menti, and ser­vice 83 in Pung­gol and Sengkang, and may be re­de­ployed to other bus routes later.</p>
    <p>The ve­hi­cles, sup­plied by the Chi­nese Yu­tong-Nari con­sor­tium, are said to be more en­vi­ron­men­tally friendly, qui­eter and more user­friendly than con­ven­tional buses that run on diesel.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the new buses cost up to twice that of con­ven­tional diesel buses. The Land Trans­port Author­ity (LTA) said it hopes the cost will come down over time with changes in tech­nol­ogy and wider adop­tion.</p>
    <p>At a for­mal un­veil­ing of the buses yes­ter­day, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port Chee Hong Tat said Sin­ga­pore re­mains open to new tech­nol­ogy and is “not in a rush” to com­mit to any one tech­nol­ogy or model.</p>
    <p>“We are do­ing it be­cause it is bet­ter for the en­vi­ron­ment and this is an ini­tial step to a greener fu­ture. We will have more op­tions to choose from when tech­nol­ogy pro­gresses,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that there was no fixed sum that the Gov­ern­ment had al­lo­cated to re­place con­ven­tional diesel buses. “What we have done in­stead is to set our­selves a goal by 2040,” he said.</p>
    <p>The plan is to have all of Sin­ga­pore’s 5,800 pub­lic buses run on cleaner en­ergy by 2040.</p>
    <p>The 10 buses join 15 elec­tric sin­gle-decker buses that have al­ready been de­ployed be­tween April and July.</p>
    <p>They are among a fleet of 60 fully elec­tric buses bought by LTA in 2018, with all ex­pected to be op­er­a­tional by next year.</p>
    <p>LTA had said then that the elec­tric buses will help it to bet­ter un­der­stand the chal­lenges of run­ning and main­tain­ing elec­tric buses in Sin­ga­pore’s trop­i­cal cli­mate and traf­fic con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>An al­ter­na­tive is buses with en­gines that run on both diesel and elec­tric­ity, 50 of which have been de­ployed on the roads since March last year.</p>
    <p>Both hy­brid and fully elec­tric buses cost more than con­ven­tional diesel ones, but are less harm­ful to the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>The 60 fully elec­tric buses to­gether are ex­pected to re­duce car­bon diox­ide emis­sions by close to 8,000 tonnes a year, the equiv­a­lent of that gen­er­ated by 1,700 cars.</p>
    <p>LTA has also touted more di­rect ben­e­fits to com­muters, with the elec­tric buses of­fer­ing smoother and qui­eter bus rides.</p>
    <p>The elec­tric bus’ am­bi­ent noise level of around 75 deci­bels is 3 deci­bels lower than that of a typ­i­cal diesel bus in the cur­rent fleet.</p>
    <p>Im­prove­ments to the buses’ de­sign – such as dig­i­tal in­for­ma­tion dis­play sys­tems that show up­com­ing stops, and the re­moval of cen­tre poles so par­ents with open strollers can more eas­ily ma­noeu­vre their way – also make com­mut­ing on the new buses less of a has­sle.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s elec­tric dreams for its trans­port sys­tem ex­tend well be­yond buses, with taxi op­er­a­tors as well as pri­vate car own­ers all en­cour­aged to switch to elec­tric ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to tax re­bates and in­cen­tives for early adopters of elec­tric cars of­fered in Bud­get 2020, the Gov­ern­ment is work­ing with com­mer­cial en­ti­ties to build up Sin­ga­pore’s elec­tric car charg­ing in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>From the 1,700 charg­ing points now, the plan is to have over 28,000 charg­ing points for elec­tric ve­hi­cles by 2030, which is also when the Gov­ern­ment ex­pects the last in­ter­nal com­bus­tion engine ve­hi­cle to be sold.</p>
