    <p>Par­lia­ment re­vis­ited the is­sue of how best to help raise the wages of low-in­come work­ers, with sev­eral Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) MPs press­ing Work­ers’ Party (WP) MP Ja­mus Lim (Sengkang GRC) for de­tails on his call for a min­i­mum wage here.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lim ar­gued, among other things, that many prob­lems faced by seg­ments of the pop­u­la­tion, such as low-wage work­ers, the el­derly and sin­gle mothers, could be at­trib­uted to “in­suf­fi­cient com­pas­sion in our pol­i­cy­mak­ing process”.</p>
    <p>While he ac­knowl­edged that Sin­ga­pore has a form of min­i­mum wage i n the Pro­gres­sive Wage Model (PWM), he noted it was not univer­sal and sug­gested Sin­ga­pore could im­ple­ment “a sim­ple, across­the-board min­i­mum wage”.</p>
    <p>The em­ploy­ment im­pact of such a min­i­mum wage would “likely be very lim­ited”, he added.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the quizzing by other MPs, Prof Lim agreed that it was not the right time to im­ple­ment a min­i­mum wage, given the on­go­ing fall­out of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He also said he did not have spe­cific poli­cies or fig­ures in mind when mak­ing his pro­pos­als, adding that he was sim­ply of­fer­ing sug­ges­tions for fur­ther con­sid­er­a­tion and study.</p>
    <p>JA­MUS LIM CON­CEDES MIN­I­MUM WAGE “NOT IDEAL” DUR­ING RE­CES­SION</p>
    <p>Ms Gan Siow Huang (Mary­mount), who is Min­is­ter of State for Man­power and Ed­u­ca­tion, said she agreed with Prof Lim that pol­i­cy­mak­ers must ex­er­cise and demon­strate com­pas­sion in pol­i­cy­mak­ing.</p>
    <p>“In fact, I think that is what the Govern­ment has been try­ing to do in many of the poli­cies and, as a re­sult, some­times our poli­cies be­come very com­pli­cated, be­cause we un­der­stand that there’s no one-size-fit­sall pol­icy that treats all prob­lems.”</p>
    <p>She took is­sue with Prof Lim’s sug­ges­tion that a min­i­mum wage would have lit­tle im­pact on un­em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>She said: “I beg to dif­fer. I think un­der cur­rent times, when busi­nesses are be­ing chal­lenged and we’re in a pe­riod of re­ces­sion, there is a very real risk that if we were to in­tro­duce a univer­sal min­i­mum wage across all sec­tors, I think many of our lower-wage work­ers may lose their jobs. From low wage, they be­come no wage. There are un­in­tended con­se­quences of some poli­cies with good in­tent.”</p>
    <p>Prof Lim agreed that im­ple­ment­ing a min­i­mum wage would not be ideal in an eco­nomic cri­sis, but he sug­gested that the pol­icy could be rolled out “af­ter the storm has passed”.</p>
    <p>Other PAP MPs who ques­tioned him in­cluded Mr Zaqy Mo­hamad (Mar­sil­ing-Yew Tee GRC), Mr Vikram Nair (Sem­bawang GRC), Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPher­son), Dr Janil Puthuc­heary (Pasir Ris-Pung­gol GRC) and Mr Si­toh Yih Pin (Po­tong Pasir).</p>
    <p>Mr Zaqy, who is Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Man­power and De­fence, said the key dif­fer­ence be­tween the PWM and a univer­sal min­i­mum wage is that the PWM is dif­fer­en­ti­ated across sec­tors.</p>
    <p>He pointed out that he had pre­vi­ously an­nounced in Par­lia­ment of plans to ex­pand the PWM with­out turn­ing it into a “blunt tool” that ap­plies across all sec­tors.</p>
    <p>“There are dif­fer­ent con­sid­er­a­tions and things that need to be worked out across sec­tors, but it’s not a new po­si­tion. It is some­thing that we’ve been work­ing on since 2012,” he added.</p>
    <p>Prof Lim replied that the dif­fer­en­ti­a­tion in wages un­der the PWM could re­sult in a “sub­sti­tu­tion” be­tween work­ers from dif­fer­ent sec­tors with dif­fer­ent min­i­mum wages. He said a univer­sal min­i­mum wage would pre­vent em­ploy­ers from “gam­ing the sys­tem”.</p>
    <p>Fel­low WP MP Leon Per­era (Alju­nied GRC) later stood up to ask Mr Zaqy how the Govern­ment would re­spond to in­di­vid­u­als earn­ing less than the $1,300 av­er­age house­hold ex­pen­di­ture on ba­sic needs and who do not fall un­der the PWM.</p>
    <p>“Should this group wait un­til the PWM comes to them? How long will that take?” he asked.</p>
    <p>VIKRAM NAIR: WHAT IS AP­PRO­PRI­ATE MIN­I­MUM WAGE FOR SIN­GA­PORE?</p>
    <p>Mr Nair asked Prof Lim what level of min­i­mum wage would be ap­pro­pri­ate for Sin­ga­pore and whether he is aware of any coun­try with a min­i­mum wage that also has a lower un­em­ploy­ment rate than Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Prof Lim replied that he did not know what level of wage would be ap­pro­pri­ate and sug­gested an in­de­pen­dent panel be formed to study this. He re­it­er­ated his claim that min­i­mum wage would have a lim­ited im­pact on un­em­ploy­ment and added that this was based on “reams and reams of stud­ies”.</p>
    <p>Mr Per­era also ad­dressed Mr Nair’s sec­ond ques­tion, say­ing that the fact that an­other coun­try has a higher or lower un­em­ploy­ment rate than Sin­ga­pore may not be causally re­lated to its min­i­mum wage pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Ms Tin asked if Prof Lim was sug­gest­ing a min­i­mum wage should be im­ple­mented but with­drawn when­ever a cri­sis hits. She also asked what wage was paid to clean­ers in Sengkang Town Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>Prof Lim replied that a min­i­mum wage is meant to pro­vide a so­cial safety net and it would be wrong to</p>
    <p>“pull the rug out from un­der those work­ers” in a time of cri­sis.</p>
    <p>He said the Sengkang team is still in the process of tak­ing over the town coun­cil and has not made de­ci­sions on a min­i­mum wage for its clean­ers.</p>
    <p>Ms Tin had also asked if Prof Lim had spe­cific pro­pos­als to im­prove youth em­ploy­ment in Sin­ga­pore, even though this was not a topic he men­tioned in his speech.</p>
    <p>As Prof Lim was ex­plain­ing the “cycli­cal” na­ture of youth em­ploy­ment, in which young peo­ple tend to de­lay their en­try into the work­force by pur­su­ing fur­ther ed­u­ca­tion, Dr Puthuc­heary cut him off.</p>
    <p>“Mr Ja­mus Lim was asked a ques­tion. While I ap­pre­ci­ate his eru­di­tion in eco­nom­ics and I’m learn­ing quite a lot from him, he hasn’t an­swered Ms Tin’s ques­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Ms Tin asked if you had a pro­posal for youth em­ploy­ment, not the prin­ci­ples on which you say em­ploy­ment changes or doesn’t change.”</p>
    <p>Prof Lim re­sponded: “We do not want to roll out... spe­cific pro­pos­als to ad­dress youth un­em­ploy­ment in a time when we are in a re­ces­sion be­cause we’re not sure if the un­em­ploy­ment is jus­ti­fied or not. That’s my rea­son for stat­ing that con­text.”</p>
    <p>He added that he did not have a spe­cific pol­icy in mind as he had not con­sid­ered the mat­ter in de­tail.</p>
    <p>SI­TOH YIH PIN ON USE OFNATION’S RE­SERVES</p>
    <p>Mr Si­toh took is­sue with Prof Lim’s com­par­i­son of the Govern­ment’s use of the re­serves for investment in ar­eas like ed­u­ca­tion amid an eco­nomic down­turn to a house­hold’s de­ci­sion to re­mort­gage its home while in­ter­est rates are low.</p>
    <p>Prof Lim had said: “If I may ar­gue, what we want is to make the best use of fi­nan­cial re­sources and not cling to some rigid ide­ol­ogy that we should never touch (the re­serves).</p>
    <p>“We are stew­ards, and as stew­ards, we are re­spon­si­ble not just for en­sur­ing that the pot will grow over time. We’re also re­spon­si­ble for tak­ing the right fi­nan­cial de­ci­sions, which in cer­tain times may in­volve spend­ing for higher investment things (like) ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“These are things that we can ac­tu­ally ex­tract a higher re­turn for in the fu­ture. We will be able to get higher tax rev­enue that will more than pay for the ex­penses that we in­cur to­day.”</p>
    <p>Mr Si­toh, an ac­coun­tant, said he was “per­turbed” by this ar­gu­ment.</p>
    <p>“If I heard you cor­rectly, you said given the low in­ter­est rate, it is now time to re­mort­gage your prop­er­ties. As an ac­coun­tant with over three decades of ex­pe­ri­ence, I can tell you that is how peo­ple start get­ting into trou­ble. I hope you’re not teach­ing that in your classes.”</p>
    <p>He added that Sin­ga­pore is one of the few coun­tries in the world that has not had to bor­row dur­ing the pan­demic and that hav­ing sav­ings “is not a sin”.</p>
    <p>Prof Lim replied that he used the mort­gage anal­ogy to show that there are in­stances where bor­row­ing against low in­ter­est rates to in­vest in some­thing that gives higher re­turns “is not just fi­nan­cially pru­dent, it is in fact go­ing to be bet­ter for your bal­ance sheet in the long run”.</p>
    <p>To this, Mr Si­toh said: “You are al­ways as­sum­ing that to­mor­row will be bet­ter than to­day... You are as­sum­ing there is a bet­ter re­turn, which may never come.”</p>
    <p>Prof Lim replied that it was pos­si­ble for a Govern­ment to over-save. He also said he was not as­sum­ing that there would be bet­ter re­turns in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“I’m say­ing if there are projects that give you bet­ter re­turns to­day, you should en­gage in those, sub­sti­tute out the lower re­turns that are al­ready locked in, by your abil­ity to bor­row at low in­ter­est rates... It is recog­nis­ing that there are high­er­re­turn projects to­day, un­less you’re say­ing that the youth of to­day in Sin­ga­pore are not worth in­vest­ing in.”</p>
    <p>This drew a chid­ing from Speaker Tan Chuan-Jin, who said: “I don’t think that was the point that was made.”</p>
    <p>THAR­MAN: DON’T EN­GAGE IN STRAW MAN AR­GU­MENTS</p>
    <p>Mr Thar­man also rose to join the de­bate even though, he said, he “wasn’t in­tend­ing to speak”.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to Prof Lim’s view that Sin­ga­pore should “no longer priv­i­lege ef­fi­ciency at the sheer ex­pense of eq­uity”, he ad­vised against mak­ing straw man ar­gu­ments like say­ing the Govern­ment is in­ter­ested only in ef­fi­ciency, not eq­uity.</p>
    <p>“That’s frankly laugh­able,” said Mr Thar­man, who is Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for So­cial Poli­cies. “Try to avoid that man­ner of ar­gu­ment, of paint­ing ev­ery­thing in bi­nary terms.”</p>
    <p>He also re­sponded to Prof Lim’s ci­ta­tion of a study on low-wage work, which he at­trib­uted to the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore. He said: “I’ve never heard economists cite a univer­sity as a source of re­search, be it a well-re­garded or not very well-re­garded univer­sity. In­di­vid­u­als do re­search and it may be very cred­i­ble re­search, but uni­ver­si­ties don’t pub­lish re­search.”</p>
    <p>Prof Lim said he did not think he was mak­ing a straw man ar­gu­ment when talking about a trade-off be­tween ef­fi­ciency and eq­uity.</p>
    <p>“I’m not sug­gest­ing that ev­ery pol­icy that is cur­rently in place is only geared to­wards ef­fi­ciency, and like­wise, I’m not sug­gest­ing that ev­ery pol­icy that I have laid out in my speech and else­where is only geared to­wards eq­uity,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Rather, it is about a con­tin­uum, and I am ar­gu­ing that we can move more in the di­rec­tion of favour­ing eq­uity over ef­fi­ciency.”</p>
