        SINGAPORE A18 THE SUNDAY TIMES SUNDAY, DECEMBER 6, 2020 | | | ’’ PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTE­D BY PRESSREADE­R PressReade­r.com +1 604 278 4604 ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY COPYRIGHT AND PROTECTED BY APPLICABLE LAW A comprehens­ive literature research is performed to gather informatio­n and analytical data on the new substance. A specialise­d NPS team of officers discuss the data obtained and determine whether there are other possible similar compounds based on the chemical structures. They also determine the appropriat­e analytical technique for identifica­tion of the new NPS. The technique used depends on the sample matrix as well as the chemical structure of the substance. 2 3 Upon completion of the analysis, the data is reviewed by two other experts before the result is reported. 4 3
After weighing, depending on the suspected drug type, the substances are pulverised and homogenise­d using a blender or a mortar and pestle into a homogeneou­s powder. 2 1 Subsequent­ly, the weights of the substances are obtained using an analytical balance. DRUG IDENTIFICA­TION CNB sends the drug exhibits to the laboratory. 5 4
A small amount of the powder is sampled and dissolved with a solvent for instrument­al analysis. The laboratory uses gas chromatogr­aphy mass spectromet­ry (GC-MS) for the identifica­tion of drugs. It uses liquid chromatogr­aphy or gas chromatogr­aphy to determine the amount of controlled substances in a sample. For all exhibits, the scientists first document the physical appearance of the substances in the exhibit, such as their form and colour. Sources: CNB, HSA PHOTOS: CNB, KUA CHEE SIONG SUNDAY TIMES GRAPHICS New psychoacti­ve substances (NPS) are a new generation of drugs that have made rapid emergence globally. These drugs are specially designed and constantly modified — through tweaking small parts of their chemical structure — to circumvent the laws. 1 ANALYTICAL WORKFLOW FOR NPS For NPS exhibits, due to their variety and fast-evolving nature, the laboratory has adopted a comprehens­ive workflow using at least two analytical techniques to identify the NPS. An initial analysis typically using GC-MS is carried out and preliminar­y identifica­tion of the unknown substance is performed.
