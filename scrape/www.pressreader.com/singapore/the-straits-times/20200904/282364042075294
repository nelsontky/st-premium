    <p>•</p>
    <p>BARCELONA Jorge Messi, fa­ther and agent of Lionel Messi, ap­peared to con­cede his son could re­main at Barcelona this sea­son, ac­cord­ing to footage broad­cast by Span­ish me­dia yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Messi Sr seem­ingly replied “yes” when asked by a re­porter if they had con­sid­ered the pos­si­bil­ity of stay­ing at the club for an­other sea­son and then leav­ing for free next year, in a video recorded by Span­ish TV sta­tion Cu­a­tro.</p>
    <p>The images were cap­tured as Jorge, who had ar­rived in Barcelona on Wed­nes­day, pulled into a garage re­port­edly for an­other day of meet­ings with the fam­ily’s lawyers.</p>
    <p>Six-time Bal­lon d’Or win­ner Messi, who has been at the Nou Camp since he was 13, boy­cotted Barca’s first pre-sea­son train­ing ses­sion on Mon­day, hav­ing handed in a trans­fer re­quest last week.</p>
    <p>Jorge was fol­lowed through­out the city by re­porters and TV crew on Wed­nes­day, and told re­porters it would be “dif­fi­cult” for his son to stay at Barcelona.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to lo­cal re­ports, club di­rec­tors met Messi and his ad­vis­ers for more than two hours on Wed­nes­day, but nei­ther party was willing to al­ter their view­point.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it ap­pears the 33-yearold’s stance may be soft­ened af­ter Ar­gen­tinian me­dia TyC Sports yes­ter­day said that he is now “90 per cent likely to stay” with the Cata­lan gi­ants.</p>
    <p>Barca in­sist their cap­tain re­mains un­der con­tract un­til June 2021 and will depart only if his €700 mil­lion (S$1.1 bil­lion) re­lease clause is ac­ti­vated, a stance backed by La Liga.</p>
    <p>While Messi, who has yet to com­ment pub­licly, is un­der­stood to be of the opin­ion he should be al­lowed to go for free this sum­mer ac­cord­ing to an­other clause in his con­tract which says he can do so, that dead­line ac­tu­ally ex­pired in June.</p>
    <p>His lawyers are ar­gu­ing that the date should be moved to last month as the cam­paign was ex­tended be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther ne­go­ti­a­tions are ex­pected to be held be­tween Barca and Messi’s en­tourage, which also in­cludes his brother Ro­drigo.</p>
    <p>The Span­ish trans­fer win­dow had closed on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Manch­ester City have ex­pressed an in­ter­est in sign­ing Messi, although there have been no ne­go­ti­a­tions as the Premier League club will only take the next step when there is clar­ity on the con­trac­tual dis­pute.</p>
    <p>While Barca are des­per­ate to hold on to Messi, their great­est goal scorer (634), it is not the case with Gareth Bale at Real Madrid.</p>
    <p>Real have been want­ing to get rid of the Wales for­ward since the start of last term – ex­cept they want to re­coup some of the £85 mil­lion fee that the La Liga cham­pi­ons forked out to land him from Spurs in 2013.</p>
    <p>No club is willing to pay a trans­fer fee on top of match­ing his enor­mous wages – said to be £600,000 (S$1.08 mil­lion) a week be­fore tax – which is why Bale re­mains stuck at the San­ti­ago Bern­abeu.</p>
    <p>His pro­posed move to Chi­nese Su­per League out­fit Jiangsu Sun­ing col­lapsed last year for the same rea­son and with two years left on his deal, Bale yes­ter­day blasted the club, say­ing “they (Real) make things very dif­fi­cult”.</p>
