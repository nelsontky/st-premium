    <p>As the United States bar­rels to­wards one of the most con­se­quen­tial elec­tions in its modern his­tory, more is at stake for the world than a sin­gle country’s fu­ture.</p>
    <p>From the bar­rios of El Sal­vador to the fish­ing vil­lages that rim the South China Sea, the ram­i­fi­ca­tions of the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in Novem­ber will be felt across the planet – but ar­guably nowhere more so than in Asia, where gov­ern­ments from Tai­wan and Ja­pan to In­dia and In­done­sia have felt the long reach of a ris­ing China.</p>
    <p>While do­mes­tic po­lit­i­cal pri­or­i­ties have fluc­tu­ated be­tween ad­min­is­tra­tions in the US, there has been a de­gree of con­ti­nu­ity in for­eign pol­icy.</p>
    <p>But un­der the Don­ald Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, the re­la­tion­ship with China, which was al­ready laced with bit­ter­ness over un­fair trade and mar­ket ac­cess by 2016, has mas­sively de­te­ri­o­rated from the roset­inted era that pre­ceded it.</p>
    <p>A phase one trade deal re­mains in­tact, but, in the words of China’s For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi, the re­la­tion­ship be­tween the two coun­tries is at its low­est point in 40 years.</p>
    <p>While a Joe Bi­den vic­tory could mean sig­nif­i­cant changes in how the US ap­proaches the world, ten­sions with China will re­main. The idea of a free and open Indo-Pa­cific will re­main a cen­tre­piece of US pol­icy, according to an­a­lysts and diplo­mats.</p>
    <p>In­dia is seen by the US as a nat­u­ral part­ner shar­ing this no­tion, even as New Delhi hedges its bets and stops short of be­ing seen as an ally of Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>And while re­la­tions with key al­lies and part­ners will re­main sta­ble – and Sin­ga­pore’s re­la­tion­ship with the US is the most prag­matic, func­tional and based on sub­stance rather than fan­fare, an­a­lysts say – a shift might oc­cur in in­ter­ac­tions with other pow­ers in the re­gion such as North Korea.</p>
    <p>Broadly, a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will re-en­gage the US in mul­ti­lat­eral ar­range­ments – like the Paris Agree­ment on com­bat­ing cli­mate change. Mr Bi­den may also re­verse Pres­i­dent Trump’s aban­don­ment of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The for­mer vice-pres­i­dent’s for­eign pol­icy group con­sists of old Barack Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion hands. Mr Antony Blinken, a for­mer deputy sec­re­tary of state and deputy na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser from that ad­min­is­tra­tion, is seen as a prob­a­ble pick for sec­re­tary of state should Mr Bi­den win.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Blinken said on Bloomberg TV: “The first thing is we have to dig out from a strate­gic deficit that Pres­i­dent Trump has put us in.”</p>
    <p>In essence, this means re-en­gag­ing with the US’ al­lies.</p>
    <p>It also means con­tin­ued support for Tai­wan, which an­a­lysts con­sider to be Bei­jing’s next tar­get now that it has al­most com­pletely ab­sorbed Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Mr Blinken warned in the same in­ter­view: “If China is get­ting sig­nals of im­punity, then one’s con­cern is it may think it can do the same with re­gard to Tai­wan.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s web­site states: “The world does not or­gan­ise it­self. Amer­i­can lead­er­ship, backed by clear goals and sound strate­gies, is nec­es­sary to ef­fec­tively ad­dress the defin­ing global chal­lenges of our time. In or­der to lead again, we must re­store our cred­i­bil­ity and in­flu­ence.”</p>
    <p>Un­der the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion and fol­low­ing decades of hos­til­ity, threats and in­sults that had the world wor­ried about nu­clear war, North Korea be­came the fo­cus of high-pro­file sum­mitry that broke the ice.</p>
    <p>But it did not ac­com­plish much more than that.</p>
    <p>“There will be a big dif­fer­ence be­tween a Bi­den pres­i­dency and a sec­ond Trump term,” said senior fel­low and Korea chair Sue Mi Terry of the Centre for Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies (CSIS) in Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>“If Bi­den wins, he will try to re­store Amer­i­can al­liances and re­build Amer­ica’s global lead­er­ship,” Dr Terry told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>“Bi­den will be more cau­tious than Trump about North Korea. He won’t rush into sum­mits with (North Korea’s Chair­man) Kim Jong Un.”</p>
    <p>Yet it is not clear what he will do, be­cause the Obama-Bi­den pol­icy of strate­gic pa­tience did not pay off, she said.</p>
    <p>“Bi­den’s ap­proach will prob­a­bly de­pend on what North Korea does. If Kim greets him with a fresh volley of mis­sile and nu­clear tests, ex­pect a frosty re­sponse from Bi­den – although with­out any flam­boy­ant rhetoric.</p>
    <p>“If Kim shows a real will­ing­ness to ne­go­ti­ate, Bi­den will prob­a­bly re­cip­ro­cate. But he will be look­ing for</p>
    <p>While a Joe Bi­den vic­tory could mean sig­nif­i­cant changes in how the US ap­proaches the world, ten­sions with China will re­main... And while re­la­tions with key al­lies and part­ners will re­main sta­ble – and Sin­ga­pore’s re­la­tion­ship with the US is the most prag­matic, func­tional and based on sub­stance rather than fan­fare, an­a­lysts say – a shift might oc­cur in in­ter­ac­tions with other pow­ers in the re­gion such as North Korea.</p>
    <p>real progress, not just photo ops.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den will also likely agree to a five-year, bur­den-shar­ing agree­ment with South Korea for main­tain­ing US troops there, with­out de­mand­ing US$5 bil­lion (S$6.9 bil­lion) a year as Mr Trump has done.</p>
    <p>“Bi­den will show that he val­ues the South Korea al­liance and does not see the de­ploy­ment of US troops as a profit centre,” Dr Terry said.</p>
    <p>South Korea-Ja­pan re­la­tions have re­cently taken a turn for the worse, and Mr Bi­den is likely to work to re­solve them as well, es­pe­cially given that dur­ing the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion, Mr Blinken in par­tic­u­lar in­vested a lot of ef­fort in im­prov­ing re­la­tions be­tween Tokyo and Seoul.</p>
    <p>The next ad­min­is­tra­tion’s pol­icy on Asia is eas­ier to define if Mr Trump wins. Un­der a Trump II ad­min­is­tra­tion, China would re­main a strate­gic ri­val and com­peti­tor of the US and will not be ac­cepted as an equal part­ner or a greater voice in de­ter­min­ing the global or­der, said Ms Shi­hoko Goto, deputy di­rec­tor for Geoe­co­nomics and senior North­east Asia as­so­ci­ate at the Asia Pro­gramme at the Woodrow Wil­son Centre in Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>But while a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion would not be con­cil­ia­tory to­wards China, it would place greater em­pha­sis on “re­cruit­ment of part­ners and al­lies to off­set China’s threat”, Ms Goto told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>A Trump loss would not be the end of his legacy, an­a­lysts said. One clear com­po­nent of that legacy is the chal­lenge to China, which has been re­ceived with grudg­ing if wary ap­pre­ci­a­tion in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Smaller coun­tries in the Indo-Pa­cific have felt the heat of China’s grow­ing in­flu­ence and want the US to re­main present. What they do not want, though, is a dis­rup­tion of the sta­tus quo.</p>
    <p>But another part of Mr Trump’s legacy may be that the US is no longer taken for granted.</p>
    <p>“Even for the strong­est of Amer­i­can al­lies, like Ja­pan, there’s a lot of con­cern that the US is not the steady, re­li­able part­ner that it used to be,” said Ms Goto.</p>
    <p>“And Amer­ica is not a united country. That is seen as something that is going to make the United States less ef­fec­tive do­mes­ti­cally, which will be re­flected in for­eign pol­icy.”</p>
    <p>This raises the pos­si­bil­ity – or the im­per­a­tive – for individual coun­tries to as­sume greater power and in­flu­ence over their own ob­jec­tives. Ja­pan, for in­stance, has dou­bled its mil­i­tary spend­ing over the last cou­ple of years.</p>
    <p>On the trade front, Mr Bi­den may be tempted to open ne­go­ti­a­tions to join the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship. Many in Wash­ing­ton see Mr Trump’s pullout from the erst­while Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (TPP) as a mis­take – even if his trade war has ex­tracted con­ces­sions from China.</p>
    <p>Asked at an At­lantic Coun­cil event last week what his wish list would be for the next US ad­min­is­tra­tion, Sin­ga­pore’s Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong listed three things: sta­ble re­la­tions with China, sta­bil­ity and pre­dictabil­ity in US re­la­tions and a re­turn to the TPP.</p>
    <p>While the US walked away, the rest of the TPP mem­bers fol­lowed through, he said.</p>
    <p>But if the US could find a way po­lit­i­cally to come back to it, “you’re not only ad­vanc­ing US in­ter­ests in the re­gion, you’re also set­ting a dy­namic in the re­gion to­wards co­op­er­a­tion and the right rules, which will help the re­gion to in­te­grate, which will build trust, which will raise stan­dards for trade and for eco­nomic ex­change”, PM Lee said.</p>
    <p>As the Amer­i­can elec­tion cam­paign hots up in the next three to four months and with China front and centre for the Trump camp, a Trump vic­tory could still cre­ate an op­por­tu­nity to cool tem­per­a­tures, said Ms Bon­nie Glaser, senior ad­viser for Asia and di­rec­tor of the China Power Project at the CSIS.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump may seek a re-es­tab­lish­ment of his friend­ship with China’s Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping and look for deals with China that ben­e­fit the US. Even Mr Bi­den, who would in­herit some of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s mea­sures such as leg­is­la­tion tar­get­ing China passed by Con­gress and tar­iffs, may use tar­iffs as lever­age, she said, speak­ing on The Straits Times’ Asia In­sider video and pod­cast.</p>
    <p>No mat­ter who wins the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, the re­al­ity in Asia will re­main the same, said Dr Satu Li­maye, vice-pres­i­dent of the East West Centre and its di­rec­tor in Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one wants to work hard to stay on the right side of the United States. And ev­ery­one is sim­ply avoid­ing be­ing on the wrong side of China.”</p>
