    <p>The pan­demic is tur­bocharg­ing the adop­tion of smart tech­nolo­gies in com­mer­cial build­ings and work­places across the is­land.</p>
    <p>Go­ing dig­i­tal is not only re­duc­ing phys­i­cal touch­points but is also al­low­ing firms to team up with in­dus­try part­ners to bet­ter un­der­stand their op­er­a­tional habits and space needs and ad­just their pro­cesses to max­imise ef­fi­ciency.</p>
    <p>While it is still big­ger op­er­a­tors that are adopt­ing these new tech­nolo­gies to boost fa­cil­ity op­er­a­tions, mid-sized play­ers are get­ting on board too, said Cer­tis In­te­grated Ser­vices se­nior vice-pres­i­dent Lee Hock Heng.</p>
    <p>It pro­vides fa­cil­ity man­age­ment to com­mer­cial and in­dus­trial build­ings such as Jewel Changi Air­port.</p>
    <p>Sen­sors in­stalled at these build­ings feed into an in­te­grated op­er­a­tions plat­form in real time and can alert the op­er­a­tions team to is­sues that need to be ad­dressed, such as an es­ca­la­tor break­down.</p>
    <p>It has also de­ployed cam­era sen­sors that can de­tect ap­pear­ance fea­tures such as the colour of a shirt, which could help to find chil­dren who have gone missing.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee told The Straits Times last month that de­ploy­ing smart fa­cil­ity tech­nolo­gies at Cer­tis’ own build­ings about 18 months ago has al­lowed it to de­ploy 20 per cent of its man­power to other means.</p>
    <p>This has been in­valu­able, given that it is al­ways short of staff, he added.</p>
    <p>Its cus­tomers can also ac­cess a dash­board that dis­plays data col­lected from the sen­sors, a process of trans­parency that helps build trust, Mr Lee noted.</p>
    <p>Be­sides push­ing peo­ple to­wards adopt­ing new tech­nolo­gies, the pan­demic has also brought peo­ple to­gether and en­cour­aged col­lab­o­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>“If we take an in­te­grated approach with a strong part­ner­ship model, you start to pro­pel yourself (for­ward), es­pe­cially when you’re us­ing tech­nol­ogy and pro­cesses to­gether... This is our fo­cal point,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, co-work­ing space op­er­a­tor JustCo has adopted a new spa­tial tech­nol­ogy that al­lows it to</p>
    <p>If we take an in­te­grated approach with a strong part­ner­ship model, you start to pro­pel yourself (for­ward), es­pe­cially when you’re us­ing tech­nol­ogy and pro­cesses to­gether.</p>
    <p>MR LEE HOCK HENG, Cer­tis In­te­grated Ser­vices se­nior vice-pres­i­dent, on get­ting bet­ter re­sults.</p>
    <p>mon­i­tor space oc­cu­pancy lev­els and en­sure that over­crowd­ing does not oc­cur.</p>
    <p>Real-time oc­cu­pancy is also made avail­able to its mem­bers through an app so they can avoid crowded cen­tres.</p>
    <p>The spa­tial an­a­lyt­ics tech­nol­ogy was pro­duced by REIn­vent, a proptech start-up that JustCo in­vested in ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>The tech­nol­ogy has been in­cor­po­rated in 10 of its 18 cen­tres here.</p>
    <p>Mr Bran­don Chia, vice-pres­i­dent and head of JustCo for Sin­ga­pore and In­done­sia, said the tech­nol­ogy al­lows staff to track how spa­ces are used.</p>
    <p>“They will also re­ceive au­to­mated no­ti­fi­ca­tions of any area that has be­come over­crowded, al­low­ing them to promptly dis­perse crowds,” he added.</p>
    <p>The cafe at JustCo’s Cen­tre­point head­quar­ters fea­tures ro­bot baris­tas de­vel­oped by tech start-up Ra­tio, which also counts the co-work­ing space op­er­a­tor as one of its in­vestors.</p>
    <p>These ro­bot baris­tas can make a range of drinks such as latte and mar­garita.</p>
    <p>Con­tact­less ac­cess to build­ings – no cards, just fa­cial recog­ni­tion – is be­com­ing the norm too.</p>
    <p>Frasers Prop­erty’s Frasers Tower, Cap­i­taLand’s up­com­ing build­ing Cap­i­taSpring and JustCo are among those that have adopted such tech­nolo­gies, with QR codes also utilised for turn­stile ac­cess.</p>
    <p>Mr Jack Lam, chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer for Frasers Prop­erty Sin­ga­pore’s com­mer­cial arm, said the de­vel­oper has also in­tro­duced an in­tel­li­gent build­ing plat­form which al­lows for re­mote mon­i­tor­ing of build­ing op­er­a­tions and book­ing of ameni­ties.</p>
    <p>It has been able to do so with the help of a soft­ware-as-a-ser­vice start-up based in the United States.</p>
    <p>Mr Lam said: “With such data, we will be able to in­te­grate all work­flow pro­cesses and sys­tems into a cen­tralised plat­form that al­lows us to have an over­all view of the op­er­a­tions, as well as make data-driven de­ci­sions on man­power re­sourc­ing and al­lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“We will also be able to iden­tify ameni­ties, events and func­tions which are pop­u­lar with ten­ants, and an­tic­i­pate fu­ture needs.”</p>
