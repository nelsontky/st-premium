    <p>A house owner who went to court, claim­ing a strip of land next to his Univer­sity Road prop­erty be­longed to him be­cause the roots of his rambu­tan trees had ex­tended into the neigh­bour­ing plot, has lost his case.</p>
    <p>The plot of land in con­tention – a nar­row strip of about 64.5 sq m with­out struc­tures on it – is owned by prop­erty in­vest­ment firm Yat Yuen Hong Com­pany.</p>
    <p>It is sand­wiched be­tween the house and Kheam Hock Park, which is on state land.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh Ah Kin ar­gued that he had ac­quired the neigh­bour­ing land through ad­verse pos­ses­sion, a law which al­lowed a per­son to lay claim to a piece of land if he had oc­cu­pied it for 12 years with­out the owner’s per­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>The law, some­times re­ferred to col­lo­qui­ally as “squat­ter’s rights”, was abol­ished on March 1, 1994.</p>
    <p>This meant Mr Koh had to prove he was in pos­ses­sion of the neigh­bour­ing land be­fore March 1, 1982, at least 12 years be­fore the law was changed.</p>
    <p>To sup­port his case, Mr Koh en­gaged an ar­borist to give ex­pert ev­i­dence, in an at­tempt to show that rambu­tan trees he planted in 1980 are the same trees that have grown</p>
    <p>I can­not see how the fact that a tree, planted by the plain­tiff within his prop­erty, and hav­ing some of its roots grow­ing into the de­fen­dant’s land, can con­sti­tute ad­verse pos­ses­sion.</p>
    <p>roots into the ad­ja­cent plot.</p>
    <p>His ar­gu­ments were thrown out yes­ter­day by High Court Judge Lee Seiu Kin, who said Mr Koh has failed to show the trees were planted be­fore March 1, 1982.</p>
    <p>In any event, Jus­tice Lee said, the trees were on Mr Koh’s prop­erty and not within the strip of land.</p>
    <p>“I can­not see how the fact that a tree, planted by the plain­tiff within his prop­erty, and hav­ing some of its roots grow­ing into the de­fen­dant’s land, can con­sti­tute ad­verse pos­ses­sion,” the judge added.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh, who bought his house in 1979, filed his claim this year. The rea­son for Mr Koh’s le­gal ac­tion was not stated in Jus­tice Lee’s judg­ment.</p>
    <p>Yat Yuen Hong Com­pany filed a coun­ter­claim, de­mand­ing that Mr Koh re­move the fences and walls that he had built around the strip of land.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh made two points to ar­gue that he has been in pos­ses­sion of the land for at least 12 years.</p>
    <p>He al­leged that in early 1980, he re­moved two fences on the strip of land and built a re­tain­ing wall and a new fence. He claimed he had also filled up the strip of land with soil and flat­tened it.</p>
    <p>He pro­duced pho­to­graphs, one dated Jan­uary 1984 and two taken more re­cently, to show the new fence.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh also ar­gued that the rambu­tan trees he had planted on his prop­erty around the same time as the con­struc­tion works are the same trees on the site to­day.</p>
    <p>He sub­mit­ted pho­tos of the trees, from 1984 and the present day, and called ex­pert ev­i­dence to com­pare branch ar­chi­tec­ture and the tree form from both sets of pho­tos.</p>
    <p>The com­pany en­gaged its own ar­borist to counter Mr Koh’s ex­pert.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Lee said that in his judg­ment the pho­tos of the fences did not help Mr Koh’s case, as the</p>
    <p>HIGH COURT JUDGE LEE SEIU KIN, on the ar­gu­ments of the plain­tiff, Mr Koh Ah Kin.</p>
    <p>fences in the two sets of pho­tos are dif­fer­ent from one an­other.</p>
    <p>The judge also said Mr Koh was un­able to pro­duce doc­u­men­tary proof of the con­struc­tion works.</p>
    <p>He fur­ther added that Mr Koh has failed to show he had built the new fence or planted the trees be­fore March 1, 1982, and has, there­fore, failed to prove he was in pos­ses­sion of the land for 12 years.</p>
    <p>The judge found that Yat Yuen Hong Com­pany re­mains its owner and or­dered Mr Koh to re­move the fences and walls sur­round­ing the plot.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, when The Straits Times vis­ited the house, it was sur­rounded by over­grown veg­e­ta­tion and did not ap­pear to be oc­cu­pied.</p>
    <p>The doors and win­dows were shut and there was no sign of move­ment in­side the house. There were also no ve­hi­cles in the com­pound.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted, Mr Koh’s lawyer Pa­trick Yap said he had no com­ment.</p>
    <p>Yat Yuen Hong Com­pany’s lawyers from Davin­der Singh Cham­bers were un­able to re­spond by press time.</p>
