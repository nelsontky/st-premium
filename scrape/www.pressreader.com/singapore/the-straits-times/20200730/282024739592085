    <p>Covid-19 resur­gences have dom­i­nated the head­lines and are threat­en­ing ef­forts by coun­tries in the region and be­yond to re­open their economies and re­cover from the rav­ages wrought by the pan­demic. But what should be equally wor­ry­ing is that the pan­demic mag­ni­fies in­equal­ity both within and be­tween na­tions. Among the hard­est hit will be the poor in devel­op­ing coun­tries who do not have the ben­e­fit of so­cial safety nets to cush­ion the ef­fects of the out­break. The pan­demic threat­ens to undo progress made in poverty re­duc­tion in the past decades. In South­east Asia, the poverty rate is ex­pected to rise to 18 per cent this year – in­stead of the fore­cast de­cline to 15.2 per cent – driv­ing 18 mil­lion more peo­ple into poverty. The eco­nomic shut­downs, in­clud­ing re­stric­tions on the move­ment of peo­ple, goods and ser­vices, are ex­pected to slash 11.6 mil­lion to 18.4 mil­lion jobs or about 4.2 to 6.7 per cent of total em­ploy­ment in the region.</p>
    <p>Those who are more ad­versely af­fected are vul­ner­a­ble groups such as women, chil­dren, the el­derly and peo­ple with disabiliti­es be­cause of a lack of so­cial pro­tec­tion and sav­ings. In par­tic­u­lar, in­equal­ity in ed­u­ca­tion has be­come more stark dur­ing the pan­demic as schools close and learn­ing goes on­line – chil­dren from bet­ter-off homes are bet­ter equipped to cope and richer na­tions are more able to pro­vide on­line ed­u­ca­tion than poorer na­tions with patchy In­ter­net and non-tech-savvy teach­ers. Ed­u­ca­tional in­equal­ity will af­fect the com­pet­i­tive­ness of both in­di­vid­u­als and na­tions decades down the road.</p>
    <p>The abil­ity of coun­tries to deal with these prob­lems de­pends on their eco­nomic re­silience, with the advanced economies be­ing bet­ter able to mit­i­gate these is­sues than less de­vel­oped coun­tries. Some coun­tries that are heav­ily de­pen­dent on remit­tances from their cit­i­zens work­ing overseas will see even heav­ier eco­nomic hits as these work­ers lose jobs and re­turn home, adding to the em­ploy­ment prob­lems there. The Philip­pines, for ex­am­ple, has more than 100,000 work­ers who have re­turned from overseas. The prob­lem of widen­ing in­equal­ity is some­thing that coun­tries in the region and in the world need to come to­gether to solve. The pan­demic has caused coun­tries to look af­ter their own na­tional in­ter­ests, but do­ing so within an in­ter­na­tional con­text would be more ef­fec­tive than uni­lat­er­ally or in iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Na­tions must aim to “build back bet­ter” to­gether if they want to head off an­other ma­jor global cri­sis. The world al­ready has a set of so­lu­tions in the sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment goals – among which are no poverty, good health and well-be­ing, qual­ity ed­u­ca­tion, de­cent work and eco­nomic growth, re­duced in­equal­i­ties, and clean wa­ter and san­i­ta­tion. Work­ing to­wards re­al­is­ing these goals will close the in­equal­ity gap and make the world more re­silient as a whole.</p>
