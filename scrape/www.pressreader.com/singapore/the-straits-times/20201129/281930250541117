    <p>The hum­ble won­ton noo­dle is set to be part of a mil­lion-dol­lar deal, with restau­rant gi­ant Jumbo Group look­ing to buy the Kok Kee Wan­ton Noo­dle hawker stall and take it across the is­land and abroad.</p>
    <p>If the pro­posed $2.1 mil­lion ac­qui­si­tion goes through, the group will take a 75 per cent stake in the 35-year-old stall. The re­main­ing 25 per cent will be held by Kok Kee’s sec­ond-gen­er­a­tion owner Shirley Leong. Once the sale is com­plete, Kok Kee will be­come an in­di­rect sub­sidiary of the Jumbo Group, which will have ex­clu­sive rights to de­velop a fran­chise sys­tem for Kok Kee in Sin­ga­pore and abroad.</p>
    <p>Kok Kee – known for its springy noo­dles and lard-based chilli sauce – started in 1985 at the now-de­funct Laven­der Food Square, be­fore mov­ing to Hoa Nam Build­ing in Jalan Be­sar. After a three-year clo­sure, it re­turned last year to its present lo­ca­tion at Bistro 8 cof­fee shop in Foch Road.</p>
    <p>Mr Ang Kiam Meng, Jumbo Group chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer and ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor, said hav­ing hawker con­cepts such as Kok Kee will help to di­ver­sify the group’s in­come streams, away from its dom­i­nant full-ser­vice dine-in res­tau­rants.</p>
    <p>“We are very ex­cited about the prospects of Kok Kee as it caters pri­mar­ily to the lo­cal mass mar­ket, well-suited for fast turnover dinein or take­away. We look for­ward to in­tro­duc­ing more of such con­cepts, if op­por­tu­ni­ties arise.”</p>
    <p>Brands un­der Jumbo in­clude the flag­ship Jumbo Seafood, Ng Ah Sio Bak Kut Teh and Zui Yu Xuan Teochew Cui­sine. On Dec 3, the group will launch vir­tual brand Hack It, which spe­cialises in seafood meal de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate re­port, the group also an­nounced a net loss of about $8.2 mil­lion for its fi­nan­cial year ended Sept 30.</p>
    <p>Mr Ang, a fan of hawker food, added: “I strongly be­lieve Sin­ga­pore has a unique food cul­ture which should be con­served and prop­a­gated.</p>
    <p>“In re­cent years, more pioneer gen­er­a­tion hawk­ers are clos­ing due to old age and lack of suc­ces­sors. This pro­posed ac­qui­si­tion is not only strate­gic to the group’s busi­ness ob­jec­tives, but also al­lows Jumbo to play our part as a Sin­ga­pore en­ter­prise to pre­serve and pro­mote our Sin­ga­pore her­itage flavours and dishes.”</p>
    <p>In an e-mail re­sponse to The Sun­day Times via Jumbo Group, Ms Leong said: “I am very happy and hon­oured to work with one of the big­gest F&B groups in Sin­ga­pore which ap­pre­ci­ates our won­ton mee – a sim­ple her­itage dish – that I have grown up and fell in love with. More im­por­tantly, they want to pre­serve it as much as I do.</p>
    <p>“Age is catch­ing up with our pioneer crew and with my own limited re­sources, it will be an up­hill task for me to man­age and ex­pand the busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>After the ac­qui­si­tion, she will stay on to en­sure a smooth tran­si­tion and over­see the trans­fer of op­er­a­tional knowl­edge to Jumbo’s team, and “hope­fully ex­pand our net­work in Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>An­other re­cent ac­qui­si­tion is Bread­Talk Group’s deal – for an undis­closed sum – with the hawk­ers be­hind First Street Teochew Fish Soup in Up­per Seran­goon Road. The 32-year-old brand is known for its sig­na­ture broth made by sim­mer­ing chicken, pork and fish bones for at least four hours.</p>
    <p>Its first new out­let un­der the part­ner­ship was launched on Nov 11 at Bread­Talk IHQ’s Food Repub­lic food court and more out­lets are likely to open in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ous high-pro­file ac­qui­si­tions in­clude Kay Lee Roast Meat Joint in Up­per Paya Le­bar Road, sold to con­glom­er­ate Aztech Group for $4 mil­lion in 2014. Two years later, Hers­ing Culi­nary sank $1 mil­lion into its part­ner­ship with hawker Chan Hon Meng of oneMiche­lin-starred Liao Fan Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noo­dle at Chi­na­town Com­plex Food Cen­tre, to set up the first quick-ser­vice Hawker Chan restau­rant in Smith Street.</p>
