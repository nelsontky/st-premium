    <p>The Covid-19 pandemic has crushed the econ­omy, sent job­less­ness soar­ing and killed over a mil­lion peo­ple world­wide. But there are a few ways in which it may prompt so­ci­ety to im­prove, and one is remote work.</p>
    <p>Though it was ini­tially nec­es­sary to keep em­ploy­ees from get­ting sick, remote work prom­ises to make peo­ple more pro­duc­tive and hap­pier while help­ing the en­vi­ron­ment and pre­serv­ing in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>When the coro­n­avirus struck, those who could do their jobs re­motely of­ten did. The num­bers have grad­u­ally de­clined as our un­der­stand­ing of safety mea­sures in­creased, but they are still sub­stan­tial. And while many peo­ple will go back to the of­fice af­ter the pandemic is over, part of the shift will prob­a­bly be per­ma­nent.</p>
    <p>A re­cent sur­vey shows a sub­stan­tial in­crease in the num­ber of work­ers who say they will not re­turn to the of­fice full-time. There are cer­tainly draw­backs to the remote trend.</p>
    <p>Those work­ing from home are far more likely to be higher-in­come pro­fes­sion­als such as engi­neers, lawyers, fi­nanciers or con­sul­tants.</p>
    <p>Most lower-in­come jobs can­not be done re­motely, such as those in the food ser­vice and brick-and-mor­tar re­tail sec­tors. That has cre­ated in­equal­ity in terms of both un­em­ploy­ment and exposure to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>And when high-in­come work­ers be­come ac­cus­tomed to stay­ing home and or­der­ing on­line in­stead of go­ing out to eat and shop, it is the lower-earn­ing lo­cal ser­vice work­ers who bear the brunt of the shift in de­mand.</p>
    <p>The trend has also taken a psy­cho­log­i­cal toll.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple who work re­motely of­ten end up putting in more hours than when they go into the of­fice. With the bound­ary be­tween job and home life blurred, there is no ob­vi­ous sig­nal that it is okay to stop work­ing, which can make it hard to re­lax.</p>
    <p>As any grad­u­ate stu­dent or en­tre­pre­neur can at­test, the nag­ging anx­i­ety of whether you should be work­ing more can eas­ily lead to burnout.</p>
    <p>But there are good rea­sons to think that th­ese neg­a­tive ef­fects will be mostly tran­si­tory. As shown in coun­tries that have dealt suc­cess­fully with Covid-19, engi­neers and lawyers will go back to restau­rants and shop at stores when the pandemic is over.</p>
    <p>While a few in­dus­tries – such as cine­mas – may suf­fer per­ma­nent de­cline, home de­liv­ery is not a true sub­sti­tute for most re­tail ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>Psy­cho­log­i­cal stress will prob­a­bly also ebb as the Covid-19 threat eases.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple who work re­motely will de­velop strate­gies to seg­ment their jobs from their per­sonal lives, and bud­get their time in ways that leave them less anx­ious. Pro­fes­sors, writ­ers and oth­ers whose jobs have al­ways been semi-remote show that this can be done.</p>
    <p>Most work­ers will even­tu­ally al­ter­nate be­tween home and the of­fice.</p>
    <p>This kind of part-time remote work prom­ises to bring sub­stan­tial ben­e­fits to so­ci­ety. Flex­i­bil­ity will add to work-life bal­ance – if a work­ing par­ent needs to stay home to take care of a sick child or su­per­vise home re­pairs, they will be able to do that with­out sac­ri­fic­ing in­come or pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Va­ca­tions will be eas­ier, too. Remote work could even in­crease pro­duc­tiv­ity, by re­duc­ing the num­ber of hours wasted by em­ploy­ees try­ing to look busy for their bosses.</p>
    <p>Remote work will also ben­e­fit Amer­i­can so­ci­ety eco­nom­i­cally.</p>
    <p>Fewer days in the of­fice means less time spent com­mut­ing. A re­cent blog post by the Fed­eral Re­serve Bank of St Louis looked at falling com­mute times in three sub­ur­ban coun­ties and cal­cu­lated that about one mil­lion to 1.5 mil­lion hours were prob­a­bly saved in each county be­tween April and July.</p>
    <p>Go­ing for­ward, the amount saved will be less, but still sub­stan­tial.</p>
    <p>Long com­mutes are as­so­ci­ated with un­hap­pi­ness, so more days spent work­ing at home will make for an emo­tion­ally health­ier pop­u­lace. It will also save work­ers money and re­duce wear and tear on the na­tion’s crum­bling road in­fra­struc­ture. Re­duced green­house emis­sions will be yet an­other plus.</p>
    <p>To max­imise the ben­e­fits from the shift to remote work, gov­ern­ment pol­icy should aim to ease the tran­si­tion. Since more peo­ple will be toil­ing out of their homes in­stead of in an of­fice build­ing, cities should change zon­ing codes to fa­cil­i­tate the con­ver­sion of com­mer­cial real es­tate to res­i­den­tial.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment can also sub­sidise ser­vice work­ers’ move to new neigh­bour­hoods to fol­low high-in­come jobs, since that is where the new de­mand will be. It can also help re­train peo­ple dis­placed by longterm shifts in de­mand (such as the de­cline of cine­mas).</p>
    <p>And it can gather in­for­ma­tion from big com­pa­nies that suc­cess­fully man­aged a shift to par­tial remote work, and share those strate­gies with small busi­nesses that might oth­er­wise have a tougher time man­ag­ing the tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>In the long run, es­pe­cially with smart poli­cies, more flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments will be a good thing.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has wreaked ter­ri­ble dam­age on so­ci­ety, but in this small way it will end up mov­ing things in a health­ier di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>Remote work could even in­crease pro­duc­tiv­ity, by re­duc­ing the num­ber of hours wasted by em­ploy­ees try­ing to look busy for their bosses, says the writer.</p>
