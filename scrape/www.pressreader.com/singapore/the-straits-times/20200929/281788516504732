    <p>Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s party col­league Ha­jiji Mohd Noor will be sworn in as Sabah’s Chief Min­is­ter to­day, af­ter Gabun­gan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) won a closely-fought elec­tion in the coun­try’s eastern-most state.</p>
    <p>GRS, a loose al­liance of seven par­ties led by Tan Sri Muhyid­din, re­solved an im­passe over their pick of chief min­is­ter, af­ter be­ing locked in ne­go­ti­a­tions for al­most 36 hours since re­sults of the vote were an­nounced late last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The main fac­tions in GRS are Mr Muhyid­din’s Perikatan Na­sional (PN) coali­tion, Umno-led Barisan Na­sional, and Parti Ber­satu Sabah.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Ha­jiji was the per­sonal pick of Mr Muhyid­din, who wanted the state’s chief to come from PN. The Barisan Na­sional coali­tion, the big­gest among fed­eral Malaysia’s rul­ing par­ties, had wanted the post for one of its can­di­dates, Sabah BN chief Bung Mok­tar Radin.</p>
    <p>De­spite in­sist­ing till late on Sun­day that Bung, who faces cor­rup­tion charges in court, should be given the post, BN chief Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi yes­ter­day went along with the choice of Mr Ha­jiji as the con­sen­sus GRS chief min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Sabah Gov­er­nor Juhar Mahirudin handed an in­vi­ta­tion let­ter for the swear­ing-in cer­e­mony to Mr Ha­jiji yes­ter­day evening. The cer­e­mony will take place at 10.30am to­day.</p>
    <p>GRS won 38 seats out of 73 in the state assem­bly, while ri­val Parti Warisan Sabah and its al­lies won 32. In­de­pen­dents won 3 seats, but the trio have since aligned with GRS, giv­ing it 41 seats.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier yes­ter­day, ru­mours were rife that some GRS law­mak­ers could lend their sup­port to Datuk Seri Shafie Ap­dal’s Warisan, thus en­abling him to re­turn as chief min­is­ter. Mr Shafie later emerged from his house to thank his sup­port­ers and the me­dia. Asked by re­porters about the next move of his coali­tion, Mr Shafie said: “We will serve the peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, i n Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia’s King, Sultan Ab­dul­lah Ri’ay­atud­din, has been treated for food poi­son­ing at the Na­tional Heart In­sti­tute and been ad­vised to re­main there for fol­low-up treat­ment. The na­tional palace said in a state­ment that the ruler will re­turn to Is­tana Ne­gara soon af­ter un­der­go­ing the var­i­ous treat­ments.</p>
    <p>The King was ad­mit­ted to hos­pi­tal last Mon­day, a day be­fore his sched­uled meet­ing with Datuk Seri An­war Ibrahim to dis­cuss the op­po­si­tion chief’s claim that he had ma­jor­ity sup­port to form a new gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s palace state­ment did not say any­thing about Mr An­war’s claim that he has “for­mi­da­ble” sup­port from the coun­try’s law­mak­ers and that Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din’s gov­ern­ment has “col­lapsed”.</p>
