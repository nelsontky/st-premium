    <p>Re­tail sales shot up in July as the be­lea­guered sec­tor con­tin­ues its re­cov­ery from the Covid-19 crunch.</p>
    <p>Turnover surged 27.4 per cent over June lev­els on a sea­son­ally ad­justed ba­sis, helped in part by a lower base in that month, the Depart­ment of Sta­tis­tics (SingS­tat) noted yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Most phys­i­cal stores were closed from April 1 to June 18 due to the cir­cuit breaker im­posed to pre­vent the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The big­gest win­ners in July were depart­ment stores, where rev­enue rose 109.4 per cent, while mo­tor ve­hi­cle sales surged 100.3 per cent as cer­tifi­cate of en­ti­tle­ment bid­ding re­sumed that month.</p>
    <p>Wear­ing ap­parel and footwear sales jumped 82.7 per cent month on month, watches and jew­ellery added 66.3 per cent, recre­ational goods were up 62.2 per cent and fur­ni­ture and house­hold equip­ment ad­vanced 36.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>If mo­tor ve­hi­cles were ex­cluded, sea­son­ally ad­justed re­tail sales would have in­creased 19.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>May­bank Kim Eng Se­cu­ri­ties econ­o­mist Lee Ju Ye said the data re­flects pent-up de­mand driv­ing a broad-based im­prove­ment as the coun­try en­tered phase two of its re­open­ing on June 19.</p>
    <p>Sales fell 8.5 per cent in July com­pared with the same month last year, well un­der a re­vised 27.7 per cent de­cline in June.</p>
    <p>Ex­clud­ing mo­tor ve­hi­cles, sales fell 7.7 per cent year on year.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mists in a Bloomberg sur­vey had ex­pected a 15 per cent yearon-year slide.</p>
    <p>Sales at su­per­mar­kets and hy­per­mar­kets surged by 28.6 per cent year on year, while com­puter and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions equip­ment sales grew by 27.4 per cent.</p>
    <p>“Marked im­prove­ment in cer­tain dis­cre­tionary items such as watches and jew­ellery, wear­ing ap­parel and footwear, recre­ational goods, mo­tor ve­hi­cles and depart­ment store sales, all record­ing the high­est lev­els since Jan­uary, sug­gests some pent-up de­mand,” Ms Lee said.</p>
    <p>SingS­tat es­ti­mated re­tail sales hit $3.3 bil­lion in July, with on­line turnover mak­ing up 11 per cent.</p>
    <p>United Over­seas Bank econ­o­mist Barn­abas Gan said on­line sales in real terms – ad­justed for in­fla­tion – grew 79.8 per cent year on year in</p>
    <p>July, far higher than last year’s av­er­age of 12.8 per cent.</p>
    <p>How­ever, low tourist ar­rivals kept depart­ment store sales and the sales of wear­ing ap­parel, footwear, watches and jew­ellery down be­tween 21 per cent and 32.1 per cent year on year.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan said: “Over­all re­tail sales may still be un­able to sur­pass 2019 lev­els, given the sharp de­clines al­ready seen in the first half of 2020 amid the lack of tourism-re­lated de­mand.”</p>
    <p>He ex­pects full-year sales to con­tract by 15 per cent.</p>
    <p>Sales of food and bev­er­age (F&B) ser­vices fell 25.4 per cent year on year – an im­prove­ment from the 43.6 per cent de­cline in June.</p>
    <p>On a sea­son­ally ad­justed ba­sis, sales of F&B ser­vices in­creased 29.2 per cent from June. The month-on­month growth was mainly due to the lower base in June when F&B out­lets op­er­ated on a take­away or de­liv­ery ba­sis un­til June 18.</p>
    <p>F&B ser­vices racked up an es­ti­mated turnover of $665 mil­lion in July, with on­line sales ac­count­ing for about 21.1 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee of May­bank Kim Eng said: “We re­main cau­tious on our out­look for re­tail sales as the pent-up de­mand may be tem­po­rary, with the econ­omy in steep re­ces­sion, the labour mar­ket see­ing large losses and house­hold in­comes fall­ing.</p>
    <p>“Con­sumer sen­ti­ments will likely re­main sub­dued for the rest of the year, which will weigh on big-ticket pur­chases and dis­cre­tionary items.”</p>
