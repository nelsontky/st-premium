    <p>BEIRUT • In the beloved bar dis­tricts of Beirut, hun­dreds of young Le­banese ditched beers for brooms to sweep de­bris in the ab­sence of a state-spon­sored cleanup op­er­a­tion fol­low­ing Tues­day’s deadly blast.</p>
    <p>“What state?” scoffed 42-yearold Melissa Fad­lal­lah, a vol­un­teer clean­ing up t he hard-hit Mar Mikhail district of the Le­banese cap­i­tal. The ex­plo­sion, which hit just a few hun­dred me­tres away at Beirut’s port, blew all the win­dows and doors off Mar Mikhail’s pubs, restau­rants and apart­ments.</p>
    <p>By Wed­nes­day, a spon­ta­neous clean-up op­er­a­tion was un­der way there, a glim­mer of youth­ful sol­i­dar­ity and hope af­ter a dev­as­tat­ing night.</p>
    <p>Wear­ing plas­tic gloves and a mask, Ms Fad­lal­lah tossed a shard of glass as long as her arm at the door of the state elec­tric­ity com­pany’s ad­min­is­tra­tive build­ing that looms over the district. “For me, this state is a dump – and on be­half of yes­ter­day’s vic­tims, the dump that killed them is go­ing to stay a dump,” she said.</p>
    <p>The blast killed at least 145 peo­ple, wounded thou­sands and com­pounded pub­lic anger that erupted in protests last year against a gov­ern­ment seen as cor­rupt and in­ef­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>“We’re try­ing to fix this coun­try. We’ve been try­ing to fix it for nine months but now we’re go­ing to do it our way,” said Ms Fad­lal­lah.</p>
    <p>“If we had a real state, it would have been in the street since last night clean­ing and work­ing. Where are they?”</p>
    <p>Al­though a few civil de­fence work­ers could be seen examining build­ing struc­tures, they were vastly out­num­bered by young vol­un­teers flood­ing the streets to help. In small groups, they en­er­get­i­cally swept up glass be­neath blown-out build­ings, drag­ging them into plas­tic bags.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers clam­bered up de­bris­strewn stair­wells to of­fer their homes to res­i­dents who had spent the pre­vi­ous night in the open air. “We’re send­ing peo­ple into the dam­aged homes of the el­derly and hand­i­capped to help them find a home for tonight,” said Mr Husam Abu Nasr, a 30-year-old vol­un­teer.</p>
    <p>“We don’t have a state to take these steps, so we took mat­ters into our own hands,” he said.</p>
    <p>Towns across the coun­try have of­fered to host Beirut fam­i­lies whose homes have been dam­aged, and the Ma­ronite Catholic pa­tri­ar­chate an­nounced it would open its monas­ter­ies and re­li­gious schools to those need­ing shel­ter.</p>
    <p>Food was quickly taken care of, too: plas­tic ta­bles loaded with do­nated wa­ter bot­tles, sand­wiches and snacks were set up within hours.</p>
    <p>“I can’t help by car­ry­ing things, so we brought food, wa­ter, choco­late and mo­ral sup­port,” said Ms Rita Ferzli, 26. “I think ev­ery­one should be here help­ing, es­pe­cially young peo­ple. No one should be sit­ting at home – even a smile is help­ing right now.”</p>
    <p>Busi­ness own­ers swiftly took to so­cial me­dia, post­ing of­fers to re­pair doors, paint dam­aged walls or re­place shat­tered win­dows for free.</p>
    <p>Mr Abdo Amer, who owns win­dow com­pany Cur­tain Glass, said he was moved to make such an of­fer af­ter nar­rowly sur­viv­ing the blast. “I had driven by the port just three min­utes ear­lier,” the 37-yearold said.</p>
    <p>He of­fered to re­place win­dows for half the price, but said he was also fix­ing some for free, given the dev­as­tat­ing sit­u­a­tion faced by many fam­i­lies fol­low­ing the Le­banese cur­rency’s stag­ger­ing de­val­u­a­tion in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>“I’ve got more than 7,000 phone calls to­day and I can’t keep up,” said the fa­ther of four. “You think the state will take up this work? Ac­tu­ally, let them step down and leave.”</p>
    <p>Out­rage at the gov­ern­ment was pal­pa­ble among vol­un­teers, many of whom blamed gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials for fail­ing to re­move ex­plo­sive ma­te­ri­als left at the port for years. “They’re all sit­ting in their chairs in the AC while peo­ple are wear­ing them­selves out in the street,” said Mr Mo­ham­mad Suyur, 30, as he helped sweep up the de­bris on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“The last thing in the world they care about is this coun­try and the peo­ple who live in it.”</p>
    <p>He said ac­tivists were pre­par­ing to reignite a protest move­ment launched last Oc­to­ber. “We can’t bear more than this. This is it. The whole sys­tem has got to go,” he said.</p>
    <p>NO LEAD­ER­SHIP</p>
    <p>If we had a real state, it would have been in the street since last night clean­ing and work­ing. Where are they? ’’</p>
    <p>MS MELISSA FAD­LAL­LAH, a vol­un­teer clean­ing up the hard-hit Mar Mikhail district.</p>
    <p>FOOD AND MO­RAL SUP­PORT I can’t help by car­ry­ing things, so we brought food, wa­ter, choco­late and ’’ mo­ral sup­port.</p>
    <p>MS RITA FERZLI REACHED THE LIMIT</p>
    <p>We can’t bear more than this. This is it. The whole sys­tem has got to go. ’’</p>
    <p>MR MO­HAM­MAD SUYUR</p>
