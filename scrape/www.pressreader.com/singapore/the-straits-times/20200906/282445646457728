    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic struck, 19-year-old Ash­ley was al­ready strug­gling with her men­tal health.</p>
    <p>Ash­ley (not her real name) re­calls: “I get anx­ious in a big group of peo­ple. My anx­i­ety got worse af­ter I fin­ished sec­ondary school, where I had friends who sup­ported me.</p>
    <p>“Grow­ing up, my self-es­teem was very low. I hated my­self. I al­ways com­pared my­self with oth­ers and I saw my­self as a fail­ure.”</p>
    <p>In 2018, she at­tempted sui­cide. At the end of last year, she did so again. Both times, she tried to throw her­self into the path of a car, be­fore a friend pulled her away from the traf­fic.</p>
    <p>The fourth of five chil­dren, Ash­ley is tak­ing a year’s break from the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion this year to re­cover.</p>
    <p>She has had mixed re­ac­tions to the Covid-19 re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>The first month of the cir­cuit breaker, which started in April, was “stress­ful and loud”, she says, as she was con­fined at home with her par­ents and sib­lings.</p>
    <p>Her mother is a can­teen ven­dor and her father, a ware­house worker.</p>
    <p>But although she missed her friends, the shut-in pe­riod, when most peo­ple worked or stud­ied at home, had re­sulted in a qui­eten­ing of pub­lic spa­ces, which con­trib­uted to her re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>In re­cent months, she has rel­ished spend­ing time alone in the hushed void deck of her Hous­ing Board block writ­ing in her jour­nal, which she started af­ter her sui­cide at­tempt last year.</p>
    <p>Jour­nal­ing has helped her re­flect on and reg­u­late her emo­tions.</p>
    <p>She also leans on fam­ily, friends and men­tors at Hap­pYouth, a men­tal wellness project by the Char­ac­ter & Lead­er­ship Acad­emy, a youth de­vel­op­ment char­ity.</p>
    <p>She says: “Think­ing about my mother and read­ing mo­ti­va­tional quotes have also helped. My sui­ci­dal thoughts rarely come back now.”</p>
    <p>Some youth like Ash­ley, who have men­tal health strug­gles, are dis­play­ing signs of re­silience de­spite the chal­lenges posed by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>This comes as men­tal health helplines have been ring­ing more as a re­sult of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>As the stresses from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic kick in, teenagers and young adults are more open to seek­ing help with their men­tal health, ex­perts say.</p>
    <p>Be­tween July and l ast month, Hap­pYouth re­ceived an av­er­age of nine calls each month re­lat­ing to youth look­ing for emo­tional sup­port.</p>
    <p>This is up from an av­er­age of three such cases a month for the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Touch Com­mu­nity Ser­vices re­ceived 142 calls to its helpline be­tween March and June, a spike of nearly 70 per cent com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>About 80 per cent of these calls re­lat­ing to men­tal health were from youth aged 13 to 21.</p>
    <p>Ms An­drea Chan, head of Men­tal Wellness and In­ter­ven­tion at</p>
    <p>Touch In­te­grated Fam­ily Group, says: “Covid-19 has in­creased the pub­lic’s aware­ness of men­tal health-re­lated is­sues and more youth are will­ing to seek help.</p>
    <p>“The sig­nif­i­cant in­crease in such calls that we’ve seen also em­pha­sises how the risks, un­cer­tainty and dis­rup­tion of life­styles dur­ing Covid-19 can trig­ger symp­toms of anx­i­ety and de­pres­sion.”</p>
    <p>Be­ing in a phase in life that places a high value on friend­ship, peer ap­proval and au­ton­omy can add pres­sure on ado­les­cents dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ms Chan says: “Not be­ing able to meet friends and go out to de­stress can lead to youth feel­ing help­less and dis­ap­pointed.</p>
    <p>“In ad­di­tion, youth are at a life stage where they feel a stronger need for au­ton­omy. Be­ing home with their par­ents for an extended pe­riod of time may re­sult in more clashes and dis­agree­ments at home.”</p>
    <p>Mr Martin Chok, as­sis­tant di­rec­tor of youth ser­vices at Care Cor­ner Sin­ga­pore, a non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion, adds that un­remit­ting headlines about Covid-19 in­fec­tions and fa­tal­i­ties have led some young peo­ple to re­flect on “life and loss in a height­ened way”.</p>
    <p>For Mr Syed Syahir Syed Idris, 23, the pan­demic has resur­faced anx­i­eties and in­se­cu­ri­ties from a 2017 se­ri­ous road ac­ci­dent he was in­volved in.</p>
    <p>A car crashed into the mo­tor­cy­cle he was rid­ing and his left leg was bro­ken in three places.</p>
    <p>He spent al­most a year in hos­pi­tal, un­der­go­ing more than 20 op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The ac­ci­dent dealt a blow to his dreams of be­com­ing a phys­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion teacher.</p>
    <p>Mr Syed, who has fin­ished his polytech­nic ed­u­ca­tion and is wait­ing to en­ter na­tional ser­vice, can no longer play his favourite sports like foot­ball and silat, though he has re­gained his mo­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>He says: “With Covid-19, most of the time, I was in my room alone with neg­a­tive thoughts about feel­ing use­less.</p>
    <p>“I re­mem­bered the time when I was in hos­pi­tal and I couldn’t do any­thing, need­ing help with daily tasks.”</p>
    <p>He kept such thoughts at bay by watch­ing stand-up com­edy on YouTube and stay­ing con­nected to peo­ple close to him, such as his girl­friend of five years, who also sup­ported him through his ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Heal­ing a bro­ken body and nav­i­gat­ing a pan­demic have some things in com­mon, he has learnt.</p>
    <p>“I will not think of any­thing neg­a­tive and will push ahead.”</p>
    <p>Care Cor­ner’s Mr Chok has not only wit­nessed teenagers catch­ing Covid-19 curve balls like hav­ing to ad­just quickly to na­tion­wide home­based learn­ing.</p>
    <p>He has also seen other teens tak­ing on tem­po­rary jobs to help their par­ents who have lost their in­come dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>One teen he knows dropped out of school re­cently be­cause of an anx­i­ety dis­or­der di­ag­nosed two years ago.</p>
    <p>He is now de­ter­mined to take up night classes in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Many youth are very re­silient, says Mr Chok.</p>
    <p>“They can adapt to changes, some­times even bet­ter than adults.”</p>
