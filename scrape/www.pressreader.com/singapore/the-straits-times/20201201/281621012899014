    <p>From to­day, any­one who needs a Covid-19 poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) test will be able to get it done at ap­proved pri­vate clin­ics.</p>
    <p>Those seek­ing tests could in­clude com­pa­nies and peo­ple re­quir­ing pre-de­par­ture test­ing be­fore travel. The lat­ter group will no l onger be re­quired to seek ap­proval from the Min­istry of Health for such a test.</p>
    <p>Be­fore this, mem­bers of the pub­lic who were not un­well and did not need to meet spe­cific test­ing re­quire­ments, such as pre-de­par­ture and pre-event test­ing, could not re­quest to get tested for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong had said on Nov 10 that the ex­panded test­ing avail­abil­ity is part of ef­forts to sup­port a larger range of needs as Sin­ga­pore re­sumes more eco­nomic and com­mu­nity ac­tiv­i­ties. The list of ap­proved test­ing part­ners can be found at https://go.gov.sg/covid19pcr­test providers</p>
    <p>Those who re­quest tests at th­ese providers un­der the new ar­range­ment will have to call the clinic ahead of time to book an ap­point­ment for their swab.</p>
    <p>They will also have to pay for the tests, which will not be sub­sidised.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan said: “We hope that through mak­ing avail­able test­ing ca­pac­ity from the pri­vate sec­tor, there will be com­pe­ti­tion and there will be more sup­plies avail­able. And by do­ing so, we will en­sure that the price they of­fer will be com­pet­i­tive, and that (it) will re­flect the true cost of the test.”</p>
    <p>Doc­tors told The Straits Times that they would be charg­ing rates of about $200, in­clud­ing GST, for the test.</p>
    <p>Dr Dale Lim, fam­ily physi­cian at The Ten­teram Clinic in Toa Payoh, said he is not ex­pect­ing an in­crease in de­mand for the tests un­til more peo­ple need to travel.</p>
    <p>Dr Lim’s clinic con­ducted about 30 swabs each week when a pro­gramme was im­ple­mented in April to let pa­tients who met cer­tain cri­te­ria be swabbed at poly­clin­ics and pri­vate clin­ics.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Dr Aziz No­ordin, a fam­ily physi­cian at Tampines Fam­ily Medicine Clinic, said his clinic has stocked up on kits in an­tic­i­pa­tion of a rise in de­mand. This will come as more peo­ple be­gin to take part in ac­tiv­i­ties such as club­bing and so­cial events as Sin­ga­pore opens up.</p>
    <p>“I ex­pect peo­ple will come for test­ing for peace of mind, but... the price may also be a bar­rier,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Health­way Med­i­cal Group has made test­ing avail­able at 38 clin­ics, up from five in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Dr John Cheng, head of pri­mary care and fam­ily physi­cian at the group, said it has al­ready seen a 40 per cent to 50 per cent in­crease in pa­tients com­ing in for swabs since Au­gust, and has been work­ing closely with ma­jor lab­o­ra­tory providers to en­sure an ad­e­quate sup­ply of test kits over the past few months.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing an­tic­i­pated this surge in de­mand for test­ing fa­cil­i­ties in the months ahead, we are ad­e­quately stocked and pre­pared for a higher de­mand for PCR tests. We will also con­tinue to mon­i­tor the re­sponse and re­stock ac­cord­ingly,” he said.</p>
    <p>MORE COM­PE­TI­TION</p>
    <p>We hope that through mak­ing avail­able test­ing ca­pac­ity from the pri­vate sec­tor, there will be com­pe­ti­tion and there will be more sup­plies avail­able. And by do­ing so, we will en­sure that the price they of­fer will be com­pet­i­tive, and that (it) will re­flect the true cost of the test.</p>
