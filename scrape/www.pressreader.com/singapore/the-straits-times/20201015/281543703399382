    <p>A “Right to Dis­con­nect” law would help em­ploy­ees have pro­tected time to rest and recharge, said labour MP Melvin Yong (Radin Mas) yes­ter­day. It would help ad­dress is­sues such as burnout and lead to safer work places, he added. He also said he hoped tack­ling these is­sues will be a key pri­or­ity of the new Covid-19 Men­tal Well­ness Task­force.</p>
    <p>A “Right to Dis­con­nect” law would help em­ploy­ees have pro­tected time to rest and recharge, said labour MP Melvin Yong (Radin Mas) yes­ter­day, adding that it would help ad­dress is­sues such as burnout and lead to safer work­places.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing dur­ing the debate on the Gov­ern­ment’s strat­egy to emerge stronger from the Covid-19 pan­demic, he cited France for hav­ing suc­cess­fully im­ple­mented such leg­is­la­tion. The coun­try re­quires em­ploy­ers and em­ploy­ees to ne­go­ti­ate the pro­to­col for non-emer­gency calls and non-crit­i­cal emails, out­side of work­ing hours.</p>
    <p>Mr Yong re­lated that a Sin­ga­porean work­ing in France had writ­ten to him, to share that e-mails sent out­side of of­fice hours usu­ally have dis­claimers that state no im­me­di­ate re­sponse is ex­pected. Com­pa­nies also sched­ule non-crit­i­cal e-mails to be sent at 8am the next work­ing day.</p>
    <p>“These are cer­tainly not rad­i­cal prac­tices, but baby steps which we can eas­ily adopt here in Sin­ga­pore,” said Mr Yong, who is an as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the Na­tional Trades Union Congress.</p>
    <p>He fur­ther pointed to the Ger­man con­cept of “Feier­abend”, which de­scribes the time af­ter the work day ends and when rest time be­gins.</p>
    <p>This shows an un­der­stand­ing of the need to “rest prop­erly in or­der to have the en­ergy to work hard and be pro­duc­tive again the next day”, said Mr Yong, who has raised the topic sev­eral times since last year.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber last year, he had pro­posed that the Work In­jury Com­pen­sa­tion Act in­clude work­place men­tal health. Af­ter the gen­eral election in July this year, he be­gan to sug­gest a “Right to Dis­con­nect” ini­tia­tive in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics of his pro­posal have ques­tioned the fea­si­bil­ity of hav­ing such a law for es­sen­tial ser­vice work­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Yong, a former po­lice­man, con­tended that Sin­ga­pore’s front­line po­lice of­fi­cers have been prac­tis­ing pro­tected time for years. “When I was with the po­lice force, my of­fi­cers and I would be on call 24/7,” he said. “We would re­ceive phone alerts on in­ci­dents hap­pen­ing through­out the day. But be­tween the ‘silent hours’ of mid­night to around 7am, these alerts were re­stricted to only a spe­cific list of crit­i­cal, sen­si­tive cases. This was to en­sure that we were suf­fi­ciently well rested, even while al­ways on standby.”</p>
    <p>He also cited a 2014 study by Stan­ford Univer­sity in the United States that found over­work­ing – work­ing</p>
    <p>As for con­cerns that a “Right to Dis­con­nect” law might not sit well with bosses who favoured those who worked longer hours, MP Melvin Yong said this was a clas­sic case of “pre­sen­teeism”, which re­search has found to be detri­men­tal to a com­pany’s per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>be­yond 55 hours a week – caused a sharp de­cline in pro­duc­tiv­ity per hour, and led to more work­place ac­ci­dents and in­juries.</p>
    <p>“(These) find­ings are not unique, and other re­searchers have found that well-rested em­ploy­ees are more pro­duc­tive, more care­ful and are bet­ter able to con­trib­ute cre­atively at the work­place,” he added.</p>
    <p>As for con­cerns that a “Right to Dis­con­nect” law might not sit well with bosses who favoured those who worked longer hours, he said this was a clas­sic case of “pre­sen­teeism”, which re­search has found to be detri­men­tal to a com­pany’s per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>While ac­knowl­edg­ing the need for a more de­tailed study on how to im­ple­ment such leg­is­la­tion, he also sug­gested the Man­power Min­istry do an an­nual sur­vey on work­place men­tal health, to track work­ers’ men­tal well-be­ing and best prac­tices among com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>He ex­pressed the hope that the Tri­par­tite Ad­vi­sory on Men­tal Health – due to be pub­lished by the end of the year – would in­clude as­pects of a “Right to Dis­con­nect”. “With clearer guide­lines, our unions can start a con­ver­sa­tion with em­ploy­ers on the pro­to­col to an­swer non-crit­i­cal work calls and e-mails out­side of work­ing hours, as well as the pro­vi­sion of ap­pro­pri­ate help for those fac­ing work­place burnout, while keep­ing their iden­ti­ties con­fi­den­tial.”</p>
    <p>Mr Yong hoped tack­ling work­place burnout will be a key pri­or­ity of the new Covid-19 Men­tal Well­ness Task­force. “Af­ter all, a men­tally re­silient work­force leads to a safer work en­vi­ron­ment for all.”</p>
