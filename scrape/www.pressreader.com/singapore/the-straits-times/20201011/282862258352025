    <p>One of the few bright spots in a very chal­leng­ing year has been the monthly e-mails from my bud­get­ing app show­ing huge de­clines in my spend­ing.</p>
    <p>I can’t take much credit for the drops, given all the Covid-19 re­stric­tions and risks that have pre­vented my fam­ily from spend­ing at usual ca­pac­ity. But still, it is nice to see some­thing mov­ing in the right di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>The app says we’ve been sav­ing be­tween US$2,000 (S$2,700) and US$3,500 each month since March. And com­pared with the same pe­riod last year, our credit card bal­ances are down 25 to 30 per cent, led by a com­plete halt in travel, din­ing out and my thrice-an­nual hair­colour ap­point­ments.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Bureau of Eco­nomic Analysis, cat­e­gories like cloth­ing, recre­ation and food ser­vices ex­pe­ri­enced rapid de­clines in the sec­ond quar­ter of this year, com­pared with pre­vi­ous quar­ters. Some of these pan­demic spend­ing habits are here to stay, at least for a while.</p>
    <p>I es­ti­mate that my new life­style can save me about US$10,000 a year at no cost to my over­all ful­fil­ment. In­stead, it can open my bank ac­count up to the things 2020 has led me dis­cover mat­ter more.</p>
    <p>SELF-CARE AND GROOM­ING</p>
    <p>I am not giv­ing up on my­self, but I don’t need all the pricey well­ness stuff that In­sta­gram­mers have been telling me is es­sen­tial. You know what is ac­tu­ally es­sen­tial? Sleep, wa­ter and stay­ing off so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>That said, I did pay over US$100 for a fancy hair­cut in Au­gust. It was my first chop in seven months, and I im­me­di­ately felt re­vived.</p>
    <p>My grey roots, how­ever, can wait. And they can be han­dled by a colour­ing kit in lieu of the sa­lon ap­point­ment. I tried the DIY kit once, deemed it a suc­cess and now I am hooked.</p>
    <p>Man­i­cures will also make a come­back, but they’ll be far more sel­dom.</p>
    <p>And as we be­came more cost-con­scious in the pan­demic, I learnt by trial that the Tar­get-brand face scrub can be just as ef­fec­tive as the fancy stuff.</p>
    <p>Es­ti­mated</p>
    <p>US$1,400.</p>
    <p>FANCY FOOD BRANDS</p>
    <p>I do far more food shop­ping now than be­fore the pan­demic, and it has taught me how to get the most bang for my buck while still eat­ing healthily. The key is to opt for cheaper store-label brands when­ever pos­si­ble. Sales of pri­vate-label goods, ac­cord­ing to Nielsen, jumped 29 per cent since March – ahead of reg­u­lar-branded prod­uct sales, which grew by 24 per cent. I fig­ure I save more per week by avoid­ing higher-end brands.</p>
    <p>Es­ti­mated an­nual sav­ings: US$1,500.</p>
    <p>FAST FASH­ION</p>
    <p>an­nual</p>
    <p>With nowhere su­per ex­cit­ing to go these days, my closet has re­mained the same since March. Once the world re­opens for good, I’ll be more in­clined to buy a new blazer or colour­ful dress.</p>
    <p>But “fast fash­ion” cloth­ing from the likes of Zara and H&M will no longer be my go-to picks. I’ve re­alised that a closet full of cloth­ing is use­less. In­stead, I plan to in­vest more in a high-qual­ity, cap­sule wardrobe – one that is heavy on the tops. Spend­ing more on in­di­vid­ual items to­day can mean sav­ing more money in the long run.</p>
    <p>Es­ti­mated an­nual</p>
    <p>US$250.</p>
    <p>WEEKNIGHT TAKE-OUT</p>
    <p>sav­ings: sav­ings:</p>
    <p>In June, restau­rants ac­counted for 1.2 per cent of our over­all credit card state­ment, com­pared with al­most 8 per cent the year prior, when we ate out (or or­dered in) some five nights per week. That is hun­dreds of dol­lars in sav­ings per month that we don’t miss.</p>
    <p>Is it eas­ier to or­der a meal on­line and have it de­liv­ered to your door? Sure. But af­ter be­ing more or less forced to cook these past sev­eral months, I’ve dis­cov­ered some joys in the rit­ual.</p>
    <p>I love watch­ing my kids watch­ing us pre­pare din­ner. They gather around the counter, build­ing up their ap­petites, ask­ing “What are you making?” and “Can I help?”</p>
    <p>I love it when the smells of roasted gar­lic and spices fill up our house, rem­i­nis­cent of when I was grow­ing up.</p>
    <p>We’re cre­at­ing great mem­o­ries and I now can’t imag­ine go­ing back to the old ways of eat­ing.</p>
    <p>Es­ti­mated an­nual</p>
    <p>US$5,000.</p>
    <p>WORK­OUT CLASSES</p>
    <p>sav­ings:</p>
    <p>Old Farnoosh would blindly drop</p>
    <p>US$300 a month on fancy fit­ness classes such as car­dio box­ing and barre, but in the past six months, I’ve paid for all but one out­door work­out class due to stu­dio clo­sures.</p>
    <p>In­stead, I’ve prac­tised bet­ter eat­ing, done some home work­outs and started to run more, all which have led to sim­i­lar re­sults. I do miss barre class, though, which can’t quite be repli­cated at home. So I’ll prob­a­bly go back to at­tend­ing a hand­ful of those ev­ery month in per­son.</p>
    <p>Es­ti­mated an­nual sav­ings: US$1,800.</p>
    <p>I’m sure that once the world re­sumes a greater level of nor­malcy, we’ll re­vert to our old spend­ing habits. I, for one, can’t wait to travel some­where other than the su­per­mar­ket.</p>
    <p>In­stead of fancy fit­ness classes such as car­dio box­ing and barre, prac­tis­ing bet­ter eat­ing, do­ing home work­outs and run­ning more pro­duce the same re­sults – and help save money, says the writer.</p>
    <p>But the re­ces­sion has un­doubt­edly taught me some big lessons about what I care about and what I can man­age on my own.</p>
    <p>This past month, for ex­am­ple, I re­placed my 2011 MacBook with the new­est model be­cause work­ing</p>
    <p>from home all day re­quired it. I’ve learnt not to wait so long to in­vest in tech, es­pe­cially for work. I also paid more for higher-end cook­ware this sum­mer, making meal prep more en­joy­able. Fi­nally, our char­i­ta­ble giv­ing is up in 2020, as the year</p>
    <p>has made it abun­dantly clear that with some easy trade-offs, we have more room to give. BLOOMBERG pod­cast.</p>
