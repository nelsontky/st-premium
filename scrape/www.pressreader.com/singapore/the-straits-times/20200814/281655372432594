    <p>BEI­JING/SHANG­HAI • Con­sumers in China have been urged to ex­er­cise cau­tion when buy­ing im­ported frozen food after a sam­ple taken from the sur­face of frozen chicken wings im­ported into the south­ern city of Shen­zhen from Brazil, as well as sam­ples of outer pack­ag­ing of frozen Ecuado­rian shrimp sold in the north­west­ern Xi’an city, have tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The chicken came from an Aurora Ali­men­tos plant in the south­ern Brazil­ian state of Santa Cata­rina, ac­cord­ing to a regis­tra­tion num­ber given in a state­ment is­sued by the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties yesterday.</p>
    <p>Shen­zhen’s health au­thor­i­ties traced and tested ev­ery­one who might have come into con­tact with po­ten­tially con­tam­i­nated food prod­ucts, and all re­sults were neg­a­tive, the city’s no­tice said.</p>
    <p>Three pack­ag­ing sam­ples of im­ported frozen seafood tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 in Yan­tai, a north­ern city of Shan­dong prov­ince, the city gov­ern­ment said on its of­fi­cial Weibo ac­count on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>State tele­vi­sion on Wed­nes­day re­ported that the outside of an Ecuador frozen shrimp pack­age also tested pos­i­tive for the virus in a res­tau­rant in the city of Wuhu in An­hui prov­ince.</p>
    <p>“It is hard to say at which stage the frozen chicken got in­fected,” said a China-based of­fi­cial at a Brazil­ian meat ex­porter.</p>
    <p>The Shen­zhen Epi­demic Preven­tion and Con­trol Head­quar­ters said the pub­lic needed to take pre­cau­tions to re­duce in­fec­tion risks from im­ported meat and seafood.</p>
    <p>The health com­mis­sion of Shan­nxi prov­ince, where Xi’an city is lo­cated, said the au­thor­i­ties are test­ing peo­ple and the sur­round­ing en­vi­ron­ment con­nected to the con­tam­i­nated shrimp prod­ucts sold in a lo­cal mar­ket.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to screen­ing all meat and seafood con­tain­ers com­ing into ma­jor ports in re­cent months, China has sus­pended some meat im­ports from var­i­ous ori­gins, in­clud­ing Brazil, since mid-June.</p>
    <p>The world’s first clus­ter of Covid-19 cases was linked to the Hua­nan seafood mar­ket in the city of Wuhan.</p>
    <p>Ini­tial stud­ies sug­gested that the virus orig­i­nated in an­i­mal prod­ucts on sale at the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Dr Li Fengqin, who heads a mi­cro­bi­ol­ogy lab at the China Na­tional Cen­tre for Food Safety Risk As­sess­ment, told re­porters in June that the pos­si­bil­ity of con­tam­i­nated frozen food caus­ing new in­fec­tions could not be ruled out.</p>
    <p>Viruses can sur­vive up to two years at tem­per­a­tures of mi­nus 20 deg C, but sci­en­tists have said there is no strong ev­i­dence so far that the coro­n­avirus that causes Covid-19 can spread via frozen food.</p>
    <p>Xin­fadi mar­ket in China’s cap­i­tal Bei­jing, a sprawl­ing food mar­ket linked to clus­ter in­fec­tions in June where virus was found on the chop­ping board on which im­ported salmon was han­dled, will be re­opened over the week­end.</p>
    <p>How the virus en­tered the mar­ket in the first place is yet to be de­ter­mined, the Chi­nese Cen­tre for Disease Con­trol and Preven­tion said in its lat­est up­date of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion last month.</p>
    <p>Viruses can sur­vive up to two years at tem­per­a­tures of mi­nus 20 deg C, but sci­en­tists have said there is no strong ev­i­dence so far that the coro­n­avirus that causes Covid-19 can spread via frozen food.</p>
