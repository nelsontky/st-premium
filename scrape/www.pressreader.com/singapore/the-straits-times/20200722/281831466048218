    <p>Against a back­drop of wors­en­ing bi­lat­eral re­la­tions with the United States, news emerged ear­lier this month of a pur­ported se­cret deal be­tween China and Iran in­volv­ing some US$400 bil­lion (S$554 bil­lion) of Chi­nese in­vest­ments in the Is­lamic Repub­lic over 25 years.</p>
    <p>While it sparked concerns that the deal could re­cal­i­brate geopol­i­tics and pose a po­ten­tial strate­gic chal­lenge to the US, an­a­lysts say this is es­sen­tially the flesh­ing out of a prior agree­ment from 2016, and should be viewed as Te­heran float­ing a trial bal­loon.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, details of a pur­ported fi­nal draft of a strate­gic agree­ment – rang­ing from in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment and mil­i­tary co­op­er­a­tion to oil trade – were leaked to the press. The draft de­tailed over 100 projects in Iran, in­clud­ing air­ports, high-speed rails and sub­ways, with China set­ting up three free trade zones across the country and con­tin­u­ing to pur­chase Ira­nian crude.</p>
    <p>This sparked fu­ri­ous de­bate in Iran, with crit­ics ac­cus­ing the govern­ment of se­cretly sell­ing out the country to China. For­eign Min­is­ter Javad Zarif, who had ne­go­ti­ated the deal in Bei­jing last year, faced fierce ques­tion­ing in Par­lia­ment last week.</p>
    <p>Ex­ten­sively cov­ered in the Ira­nian press, it was met with near si­lence in China, and the country’s nor­mally out­spo­ken For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian was cir­cum­spect when asked.</p>
    <p>“China and Iran en­joy a tra­di­tional friend­ship, and the two sides have been in com­mu­ni­ca­tion on the de­vel­op­ment of bi­lat­eral re­la­tions. We stand ready to work with Iran to steadily ad­vance practical co­op­er­a­tion,” he said on July 6.</p>
    <p>As the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion con­tin­ues with its max­i­mum pres­sure cam­paign against Iran, while en­gaged in hos­til­i­ties on mul­ti­ple fronts with China, it would ap­pear that Wash­ing­ton has pushed Te­heran to­wards Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>But the re­al­ity is far more com­plex than that, said former Chi­nese am­bas­sador to Iran Hua Lim­ing, not­ing China’s lack of ac­knowl­edge­ment about the draft.</p>
    <p>“This is something that has been stirred up by the Ira­ni­ans and turned into a po­lit­i­cal prob­lem,” Mr Hua told The Straits Times, adding that the un­fair trade deals sug­gested by crit­ics “go against the spirit of Chi­nese diplo­macy”.</p>
    <p>“In a way, it’s also the Ira­nian govern­ment try­ing to gauge pub­lic re­ac­tion to a deal be­fore try­ing to fine-tune it.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s visit to Iran in 2016, both sides agreed to a Com­pre­hen­sive Strate­gic Part­ner­ship, which was put on the back burner un­til the mid­dle of last year when the Ira­nian econ­omy started to feel the ef­fects of re­newed sanc­tions af­ter the US pulled out of a 2015 nu­clear agree­ment.</p>
    <p>The draft that ap­peared ear­lier this month is sim­ply a more de­tailed ver­sion of what had pre­vi­ously been agreed, said Mr Ja­copo Scita, an Al-Sabah doc­toral fel­low at Durham Univer­sity. Both sides have sug­gested more ne­go­ti­a­tions are needed be­fore it is ready and even then, it would have to be tabled in Iran’s Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Yet even then, the doc­u­ment lacks con­crete fig­ures and ac­tual dead­lines, he added.</p>
    <p>“From the Ira­nian per­spec­tive, it’s a good op­por­tu­nity to send a mes­sage to the US say­ing ‘you try to iso­late us, but we can re­sist your sanc­tions’ and also ‘we have a sort of part­ner in the form of China, who is will­ing to cut a long-term deal’,” Mr Scita said.</p>
    <p>Still, do­mes­tic crit­ics have pointed to pre­vi­ous Chi­nese in­vest­ment projects that have left states in Africa and Asia in­debted and be­holden to Bei­jing, with one of the most vo­cal be­ing former pres­i­dent Mah­moud Ah­madine­jad.</p>
    <p>Dr Alessan­dro Ar­duino of the Mid­dle East In­sti­tute at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Singapore said: “The re­la­tion­ship be­tween China and Iran is not in a vac­uum. There’s al­ways the US in it and one al­ways has to look at it in terms of a tri­an­gu­lar re­la­tion­ship.”</p>
    <p>But with China still try­ing to re­cover from the im­pact of the coro­n­avirus out­break while at odds with the US on diplo­matic and eco­nomic fronts, there ap­pears to be lit­tle more to gain for Bei­jing, which is one of Iran’s re­main­ing trade partners.</p>
    <p>“Es­sen­tially, it’s not go­ing to be a game-changer; while it might shift (Iran) to look to­wards Asia rather than Europe, all par­ties, es­pe­cially China, will still be very care­ful be­cause they don’t want to in­cur the wrath of the US,” he added.</p>

The news of a pur&#xAD;ported se&#xAD;cret deal be&#xAD;tween China and Iran has led crit&#xAD;ics in the Is&#xAD;lamic Repub&#xAD;lic to ac&#xAD;cuse the govern&#xAD;ment of se&#xAD;cretly sell&#xAD;ing out the country to China.</p>
