    <p>Com­i­cal, it was to some, for there was more than an iota of ab­sur­dity in it.</p>
    <p>Con­sol­ing it was to the many hack­ers who are fa­mil­iar with dou­ble-digit en­tries to score­cards.</p>
    <p>How­ever, re­al­is­ti­cally, com­mis­er­a­tions should be in or­der, for the charis­matic news­maker is one who prob­a­bly con­trib­uted more than any other pro­fes­sional golfer in glob­al­is­ing the game.</p>
    <p>Dressed in his favourite Sun­day red, Tiger Woods, the 15-time Ma­jor win­ner and only sec­ond to Jack Nick­laus (18), crum­bled to a 10 on the par-three, 148-yard 12th hole on the fi­nal day of the US Mas­ters at Au­gusta a fort­night ago</p>
    <p>is tee-shot spun off the green and rolled back into water. He went to the drop area and his ball got drenched again. He spun the fifth shot into the back bunker, and from a dif­fi­cult lie, soaked an­other ball.</p>
    <p>And when he left Rae’s Creek, he posted the high­est num­ber he has shot on one hole in his Ma­jor cham­pi­onship his­tory.</p>
    <p>Dis­ap­pointed he surely was. De­jec­tion was ev­i­dent in his de­meanour as he am­bled to the 13th tee-box. Im­me­di­ately, while watch­ing the live tele­cast, I re­ceived a what­sapp mes­sage from a fa­nat­i­cal fan. “Tiger’s fin­ished,” it screamed. “Time to go,” was the suf­fix in that re­minder.</p>
    <p>But Woods did not al­low the mess to mud­dle his mind. Stand­ing ram­rod straight on the 13th tee-box, he threw his chest for­ward, in­haled venom and coughed up five birdies in the last six holes to bounce back with a red-num­bered (mi­nus one) to­tal.</p>
    <p>That com­prised a make­able ea­gleputt at the 13th, a chip close at the 15th, a stiff knock at the 16th and fab­u­lous ap­proaches at the last two holes.</p>
    <p>My “fa­nat­i­cal fan” friend punched a new what­sapp mes­sage quickly. It read: “No, he’s not fin­ished, he still has plenty in his tank.”</p>
    <p>Woods, who im­mersed him­self in doubt by pick­ing up the grass a few times to check wind strength and di</p>

    <p>rec­tion at the 12th tee-box, turned vil­lain to hero as he walked off the 18th green.</p>
    <p>And calm and com­posed, he told CBS’s Amanda Balio­nis: “Well, I com­mit­ted to the wrong wind,” dur­ing an in­ter­view after his round of 76, which left him in a tie for 38th.</p>
    <p>Hero­ics, the five-time Mas­ters win­ner and de­fend­ing cham­pion, have had plenty in Ma­jors, no­tably</p>
    <p>when he won the 2008 US Open on an in­jured knee.</p>
    <p>So what now for the once-teenage won­der turned elder states­man who hits 45 next month?</p>
    <p>The hori­zon is get­ting bleaker for the wounded man. Knee re­pairs, spinal fu­sion surgery and a trou­bling back could dash his per­sonal am­bi­tions.</p>
    <p>But he has al­ready etched his name in the record books, not least with his</p>
    <p>Zozo Championsh­ips vic­tory last year that put him on par with Sam Snead on a mile­stone 82 PGA tri­umphs.</p>
    <p>Achiev­ing more would be a huge bonus for the me­gas­tar. Mo­ti­va­tion he has. Aura he demon­strates still. Con­fi­dence he oozes.</p>
    <p>How­ever, his body can­not take any more beat­ing. That would mean not over­do­ing it and care­fully pick­ing his tour­na­ments, cut­ting down on prac­tice ses­sions so that phys­i­cally he can re­main in tune, and main­tain­ing the fo­cus he thrives on.</p>
    <p>Like his cad­die Joe LaCava said just after the Mas­ters: “He drove it well this week for the most part, hit a lot of dif­fer­ent shots, the high bombs, lit­tle low cut­ters. He’s work­ing the ball nicely. If he can stay healthy, there were some good signs this week.”</p>
    <p>And in the fu­ture, hope­fully.</p>
