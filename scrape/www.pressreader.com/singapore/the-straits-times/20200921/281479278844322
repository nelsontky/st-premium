    <p>The Straits Times’</p>
    <p>Char­maine Ng looks at how home-grown com­pa­nies in the se­cu­rity, clean­ing and lo­gis­tics sec­tors are cop­ing with the man­power short­age caused by Covid-19 re­stric­tions</p>
    <p>It is not doom and gloom on the jobs front for some sec­tors in Sin­ga­pore, eight months into the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The se­cu­rity, lo­gis­tics and clean­ing sec­tors are, in fact, fac­ing man­power short­ages.</p>
    <p>In the se­cu­rity in­dus­try, for in­stance, de­mand for of­fi­cers in some lo­ca­tions such as dor­mi­to­ries has pushed up salaries quite a bit.</p>
    <p>One ad­ver­tise­ment posted on­line, for se­cu­rity of­fi­cers in “green zone” dor­mi­to­ries – those cleared of Covid-19 – of­fered a gross monthly salary of $3,200.</p>
    <p>A sur­vey con­ducted by the Union of Se­cu­rity Em­ploy­ees and the Sin­ga­pore Uni­ver­sity of So­cial Sci­ences be­tween Jan­uary and Fe­bru­ary found the me­dian av­er­age monthly take-home pay for a se­cu­rity of­fi­cer was $1,975.</p>
    <p>The pres­i­dent of the Se­cu­rity As­so­ci­a­tion Sin­ga­pore, Mr Raj Joshua Thomas, said wage rates for se­cu­rity of­fi­cers had risen sharply, es­pe­cially at sites with a height­ened risk of ex­po­sure to Covid-19 such as “red zone” dor­mi­to­ries – those that have yet to be cleared of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“Buy­ers need to be pre­pared to pay higher prices as the de­mand now far out­strips the num­ber of per­sons with se­cu­rity li­cences,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that since the pan­demic broke out, de­mand for se­cu­rity of­fi­cers has in­creased by around 10 per cent to 20 per cent, or roughly 5,000 to 10,000 po­si­tions, of which the ma­jor­ity are for an­cil­lary roles such as tem­per­a­ture tak­ers and front-line staff.</p>
    <p>Most of th­ese po­si­tions are be­ing filled by se­cu­rity of­fi­cers work­ing on an ad hoc ba­sis, he said.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pect that as the Covid-19 mea­sures wind down, th­ese po­si­tions will also grad­u­ally re­duce in num­ber,” said Mr Thomas.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, as we ex­pect that tem­per­a­ture screen­ing, manda­tory SafeEn­try regis­tra­tions and dec­la­ra­tions are likely to con­tinue for some time, there is po­ten­tial for ad hoc po­si­tions to be con­verted to full time – with the caveat that per­sons em­ployed in this roles must be pre­pared to be re­de­ployed once their po­si­tions are made re­dun­dant.”</p>
    <p>The clean­ing and lo­gis­tics sec­tors, which of­ten rely on for­eign work­ers, are also fac­ing a squeeze on man­power.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies in the clean­ing in­dus­try say de­mand has dou­bled along with the amount of work. The fre­quency of clean­ing and dis­in­fec­tion has in­creased to at least once a day at sev­eral places such as of­fices, gyms and shop­ping malls.</p>
    <p>To help the in­dus­try meet the in­creased de­mand, the National En­vi­ron­ment Agency en­hanced the En­vi­ron­men­tal Ser­vices Pro­duc­tiv­ity So­lu­tions Grant last month. It sup­ports up to 80 per cent of the cost of clean­ing so­lu­tions to raise the op­er­a­tional ef­fi­ciency and pro­duc­tiv­ity of com­mer­cial busi­nesses, capped at $350,000 per com­pany.</p>
    <p>This comes as hir­ing more clean­ers has proven to be dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Bryan Goh, the com­pany di­rec­tor of A1 Fa­cil­ity Ser­vices: “We did put out more job ads, but very few Sin­ga­pore­ans want to do this kind of job. And now that the bor­der is closed, we can’t hire more for­eign work­ers, so we have no choice but to charge our clients much more.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Lo­gis­tics As­so­ci­a­tion chair­man Dave Ng said the lo­gis­tics sec­tor is also see­ing more hir­ing in ar­eas re­lated to home de­liv­er­ies and e-com­merce, for non-PMET (pro­fes­sional, man­ager, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian) roles.</p>
    <p>But most Sin­ga­pore­ans are not keen to take up th­ese po­si­tions, he added. “For the long­est time, th­ese jobs have been taken up by for­eign­ers. So Sin­ga­pore­ans in this sec­tor have been in su­per­vi­sory or man­age­ment roles. It’s very dif­fi­cult to ask them to ‘re­verse’ and do all th­ese jobs,” said Mr Ng.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has spurred more lo­gis­tics com­pa­nies to trans­form their busi­ness in the face of th­ese chal­lenges, he added.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 is a good ex­am­ple of why we needed to em­bark on the In­dus­try Trans­for­ma­tion Map (ITM). No­body praised the ITM four years ago – peo­ple said it was a waste of time and re­sources. But those who did so, their sys­tems are al­ready in place and they are fully tak­ing ad­van­tage of it now,” he said.</p>
