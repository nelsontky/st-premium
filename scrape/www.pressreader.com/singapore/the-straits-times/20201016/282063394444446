    <p>The step­brother of Mustafa Cen­tre boss Mus­taq Ah­mad felt that his fam­ily were treated like “ser­vants” and liv­ing like con­struc­tion work­ers, the High Court heard yes­ter­day in an on­go­ing trial.</p>
    <p>Mr Ayaz Ahmed told the court that he and 13 other ex­tended fam­ily mem­bers were put up at a Chancery Lane town­house, while Mr Mus­taq was build­ing an apart­ment block.</p>
    <p>After the build­ing was com­pleted, Mr Ayaz did not move in and in­stead lived in a 2,800 sq ft apart­ment with 10 other peo­ple, which he com­pared with liv­ing con­di­tions of con­struc­tion work­ers.</p>
    <p>The de­tails emerged as Mr Ayaz was cross-ex­am­ined by Mr Mus­taq’s lawyer, Se­nior Coun­sel Alvin Yeo, for the third day.</p>
    <p>Mr Ayaz, his four sib­lings and their mother have sued Mr Mus­taq, his wife and their two chil­dren for mi­nor­ity op­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>The plain­tiffs are ask­ing for Mo­hamed Mustafa and Sam­sud­din Co, the com­pany be­hind the pop­u­lar depart­ment store, to be wound up and for a liq­uida­tor to be ap­pointed to look into the af­fairs of the com­pany.</p>
    <p>Mr Mus­taq con­tends that the law­suit was fu­elled by greed and that his step-fam­ily was “turn­ing around to bite the hand that feeds them” after he paid for their ex­penses over the years.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Yeo noted that Mr Mus­taq pro­vided Mr Ayaz with a “rent-free flat” and a town­house.</p>
    <p>Mr Ayaz replied that he, his wife and two chil­dren had a room in the house, which they shared with oth­ers in­clud­ing Mr Mus­taq’s son Osama. “I wanted to stay sep­a­rately with my own fam­ily,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo also sug­gested that Mr Ayaz had en­gaged con­sul­tant Ra­jesh Bafna in 2016 to “find mat­ters which you could raise in a claim against Mr Mus­taq”. Mr Ayaz dis­agreed.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Mr Ayaz, it was after he en­gaged Mr Bafna that he found out about two “wrong­ful” share al­lot­ments in 1995 and 2001, which ef­fec­tively in­creased the share­hold­ing of Mr Mus­taq and his wife.</p>
    <p>The plain­tiffs have chal­lenged the au­then­tic­ity of the share­hold­ers’ res­o­lu­tions au­tho­ris­ing the al­lot­ments, say­ing that there are dis­crep­an­cies be­tween the res­o­lu­tions and the no­tice of res­o­lu­tion filed with the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo showed Mr Ayaz doc­u­ments to sug­gest that the cor­po­rate sec­re­tar­ial prac­tices of the com­pany at the time were “fairly in­for­mal” and that dis­crep­an­cies did not mean that the doc­u­ments are not gen­uine.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo added that the share al­lot­ments were agreed to by all the share­hold­ers at the time, and they signed on these min­utes of the ex­tra-or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ing. Mr Ayaz did not ac­cept this.</p>
    <p>The trial con­tin­ues.</p>
