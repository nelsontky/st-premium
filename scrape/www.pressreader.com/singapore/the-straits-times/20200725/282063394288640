    <p>The last five of the 18 peo­ple who were al­legedly part of an un­law­ful gath­er­ing in Sengkang dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker ap­peared in a dis­trict court yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The five – Peh Si Qin, 21; Nic­man Lim Wei Fong, 25; Jasper Tan Zhi Hong, 25; Chee Min Hui, 27; and Chua Jie Kun, 28 – are ac­cused of leav­ing their homes to at­tend the event at Block 295C Com­pass­vale Cres­cent in May. They face two charges each un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar charges were pressed against 13 oth­ers ear­lier this week.</p>
    <p>The res­i­dents of the flat, Cassie Ong Shi Hong, 32, and Leong Chee Mun, 37, al­legedly al­lowed 16 guests into their home from 10pm on May 8 to around 2am the next day.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments do not dis­close the na­ture of their re­la­tion­ship. An In­ter­net search re­veals that the pair are not mar­ried to each other and Leong is the sole owner of the flat.</p>
    <p>The other 11 are: Moey Kai Yi, 18; Thant Thaw Kuang, 19; Cavin Liow Jun Rong, 20; Poh Yang Ting, 21; Felisa Chua Jia Xuan, 23; Low Wei Hao, 25; Mandy Tan Yi Xing, 26; Kho Zi Ting, 27; Jack­son Tan Chia Ho, 30; Jas­min Tan Ee Lin, 30; and Priscilia Tan Sze Hui, 31.</p>
    <p>Myan­mar na­tional Thant Thaw Kuang is a Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent, while the 17 oth­ers are Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>All of them are ex­pected to plead guilty to their of­fences ex­cept for Leong, whose case has been ad­journed to Aug 13.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said in a state­ment on Tues­day that the res­i­dents of the flat in­vited eight men and eight women to their home for a so­cial gath­er­ing on May 8 dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>From April 7 to June 1, mem­bers of the pub­lic were not al­lowed to leave their place of res­i­dence with­out a valid rea­son or meet other in­di­vid­u­als not liv­ing in the same place of res­i­dence for any so­cial pur­pose.</p>
    <p>Po­lice had said: “The au­thor­i­ties will not hes­i­tate to take ac­tion against any­one who does not com­ply with (safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures) or shows bla­tant dis­re­gard for our laws.”</p>
    <p>For each charge un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act, a first-time of­fender can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $10,000.</p>
    <p>A re­peat of­fender can be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $20,000.</p>
