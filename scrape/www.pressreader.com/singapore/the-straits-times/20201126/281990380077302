    <p>“This is a prob­lem fac­ing ev­ery coun­try be­cause of the lock­down and down­turn in the econ­omy. Many busi­nesses are fac­ing cash flow prob­lems. It is not un­ex­pected that bal­ance sheets will be some­what im­paired (dur­ing times like these). We have seen cases re­ported re­cently of bond de­faults by China’s small state-owned en­ter­prises, and even a big prop­erty com­pany, Ever­grande.</p>
    <p>“The reg­u­la­tors are very much aware of this. They know they have to man­age this. We don’t see a sys­temic cri­sis at all for China, but we do see some of the smaller banks to have prob­lems be­cause they are not well cap­i­talised and need to be re­cap­i­talised. Over­all, (the) au­thor­i­ties are aware of this and (have) tried to ad­dress this on a case-by-case ba­sis.</p>
    <p>“There will be distress in the cor­po­rate sec­tor but our as­sess­ment is that these are man­age­able, and if you look at prof­itabil­ity, they have started to re­cover quite strongly. On bal­ance, most of the big banks are well cap­i­talised and should be able to han­dle this. The smaller (Chi­nese) banks will have some prob­lems and in the cor­po­rate sec­tor, small SMEs (small and medium-sized en­ter­prises) will be the ones that will be hit hard­est. The big­ger cor­po­rates are gen­er­ally okay.”</p>
    <p>Re­pro­duced al­most ver­ba­tim, the words are from Dr Khor Hoe Ee, chief econ­o­mist at AMRO, short for Asean+3 Macroe­co­nomic Re­search Of­fice, lo­cated in the MAS Build­ing down­town.</p>
    <p>They were made on Tues­day at the an­nual Asean Me­dia Fo­rum hosted by Viet­nam and came in re­sponse to my ques­tion on whether the rest of us in Asia, par­tic­u­larly Asean, should be wor­ried about re­ports of a se­ries of bond de­faults by Chi­nese com­pa­nies and the re­pay­ment stresses be­ing en­dured by one of the most in­debted, prop­erty gi­ant China Ever­grande Group.</p>
    <p>Dr Khor’s as­sess­ment is of­fered up­front lest any­one read­ing this col­umn be tempted to call his wealth man­ager to sell all China-re­lated stocks or paper in his port­fo­lio, fear­ing an im­mi­nent cri­sis. That is not the mes­sage in­tended.</p>
    <p>In­deed, more than one an­a­lyst I spoke to for this col­umn of­fered re­as­sur­ance on the ca­pa­bil­ity of the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties to face down this chal­lenge, as they have with so many chal­lenges be­fore. Be­sides, bond de­faults have been oc­cur­ring since at least 2014, so this isn’t en­tirely a new phe­nom­e­non.</p>
    <p>THE GROW­ING DEBT PILE</p>
    <p>Hav­ing said that, it would be knav­ish to ig­nore the canker al­to­gether, given that the debt re­pay­ment prob­lem seems to be wors­en­ing and some erup­tions seem in­evitable.</p>
    <p>This year, the China debt pile re­ceived even closer at­ten­tion af­ter global me­dia high­lighted the strug­gles of China Ever­grande, the world’s most in­debted de­vel­oper and China’s No. 2 de­vel­oper.</p>
    <p>Ever­grande is es­ti­mated to have to­tal debt of 835 bil­lion yuan (S$170 bil­lion) as at end-June, a run up from the 800 bil­lion yuan last</p>
    <p>De­cem­ber. Its strate­gic in­vestors, which in­clude in­te­rior dec­o­rat­ing, door mak­ing and equip­ment sup­ply­ing firms, swiftly threw it a US$13 bil­lion (S$17.5 bil­lion) life­line, staving off the cri­sis. That said, no one be­lieves he has heard the last word on the sub­ject.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Bloomberg data, on­shore delin­quen­cies in China have al­ready touched 104 bil­lion yuan, or nearly US$16 bil­lion, so far this year. The off­shore fig­ure is US$8.1 bil­lion, mean­while, more than twice the to­tal last year. Missed prin­ci­pal and in­ter­est pay­ments have amounted to 34 bil­lion yuan so far this year, con­sti­tut­ing the sec­ond-big­gest trig­ger of com­pany de­faults.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem ex­tends be­yond the prop­erty sec­tor. Ac­cord­ing to Bloomberg, the tech­nol­ogy sec­tor led by Pek­ing Univer­sity Founder Group, the busi­ness arm of what is one of China’s best-re­garded uni­ver­si­ties, has ac­counted for more than a third of the ag­gre­gate amount in de­fault this year. Sec­ond-big­gest is the cycli­cal con­sumer sec­tor com­pris­ing six com­pa­nies led by Tunghsu Group and Bril­liance Auto Group. Third are the devel­op­ers, in­clud­ing Ta­hoe Group and Tian­jin Real Es­tate Group Co.</p>
    <p>State-owned en­ter­prises (SOEs) aren’t im­mune. They are reck­oned to con­sti­tute a lit­tle more than half of China’s US$4 tril­lion cor­po­rate debt mar­ket and many have typ­i­cally op­er­ated by is­su­ing new bonds to pay off old ones com­ing due. No­table state-owned com­pa­nies de­fault­ing on bonds this month in­clude Yongcheng Coal and Elec­tric­ity Hold­ing Group, which had a top-grade credit rat­ing, and Ts­inghua Un­i­group, a high-pro­file tech­nol­ogy com­pany.</p>
    <p>Lack of new fund­ing streams is caus­ing distress to Yongcheng, which ap­par­ently hasn’t paid some of its 180,000 work­ers for months. The com­pany was to have is­sued 2.6 bil­lion yuan of new bonds this month. Now, Bei­jing is tak­ing a strict surveil­lance eye to such moves and is rein­ing them in.</p>
    <p>It needs to. Econ­o­mists note that Chi­nese to­tal debt bur­den stands at US$43 tril­lion, al­most three times its gross do­mes­tic prod­uct. Mean­while, growth in Chi­nese labour pro­duc­tiv­ity has fallen steadily over the past decade, even as the work­ing-age pop­u­la­tion shrinks by the day. To boost growth then would re­quire adding on debt and that’s fraught with risks.</p>
    <p>WIDER IM­PACT</p>
    <p>How does all this feed into the larger pic­ture for the rest of us?</p>
    <p>Yongcheng is based in He­nan in cen­tral China, a prov­ince that has the coun­try’s fifth-largest re­gional econ­omy. Any se­ri­ous seizures in China’s cor­po­rate world will, there­fore, un­doubt­edly im­pact not just the do­mes­tic Chi­nese econ­omy but, ul­ti­mately, the global econ­omy’s health as well. That’s be­cause China to­day ac­counts for nearly a fifth of the global econ­omy and more than 10 per cent of global im­ports.</p>
    <p>Those that live on China’s pe­riph­ery and have the main­land as their top trad­ing part­ner will no doubt be the most af­fected and have the most to fear.</p>
    <p>There doesn’t seem to be much of a chance of things eas­ing any time soon to im­prove sen­ti­ment.</p>
    <p>Last month, a de­tailed re­port by Moody’s In­vestors Ser­vice said China’s on­shore and off­shore cor­po­rate bond de­faults are set to rise over the next 12 months, with fi­nan­cially weak pri­vately owned com­pa­nies more likely to de­fault than SOEs. Moody’s also warned that post-de­fault set­tle­ment paths will dif­fer, with bond in­vestors hav­ing lim­ited bar­gain­ing power and op­tions in debt re­struc­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est­ingly, the re­port sug­gested that SOEs may no longer en­joy im­plicit state guar­an­tees and that the au­thor­i­ties may pick and choose the SOEs to pro­tect, de­pend­ing on their as­sess­ment of the po­ten­tial for sys­temic risk from their de­faults.</p>
    <p>This is why South-east Asia must watch devel­op­ments closely. A com­pany that goes belly up hurts in­vestors, and the fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions that lent it money.</p>
    <p>In the past, Bei­jing has or­dered giants like the In­dus­trial and Com­mer­cial Bank of China (ICBC) to step in and res­cue smaller lenders to pre­serve the health of the sys­tem. This is what hap­pened with Bank of Jinzhou last year, when ICBC forked over 3 bil­lion yuan for a near-11 per cent stake in Jinzhou, a move that pushed its stock price down by a tenth.</p>
    <p>Be­yond a point, there may be lim­its to such ac­tions. Ear­lier this year, Bei­jing al­lowed Baoshang Bank, which it had sim­i­larly res­cued, to go un­der in the first such in­sol­vency since 2001.</p>
    <p>It prob­a­bly is a bless­ing that China’s fi­nan­cial link­ages to</p>
    <p>South-east Asia aren’t so de­vel­oped that a shock on the main­land could dis­rupt trade finance for the re­gion, as hap­pened when Euro­pean lenders in Asia seized up dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis or Ja­panese banks dur­ing the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Pri­vate sec­tor econ­o­mist Manu Bhaskaran, di­rec­tor and chief ex­ec­u­tive of Cen­ten­nial Asia Ad­vi­sors, says China is not un­fa­mil­iar with pe­ri­ods of fi­nan­cial stress such as the cur­rent one. As long as the erup­tions are bite-sized, he says, they have been man­age­able and the au­thor­i­ties have been on top of things.</p>
    <p>“But can they con­tinue to man­age, we do not know,” he says. “Cor­po­rate debt has bal­looned. Growth has stalled. There must be a lot of fi­nan­cial stress around. If any­thing were to hap­pen there, the main im­pact will be through the busi­ness con­fi­dence chan­nel.”</p>
