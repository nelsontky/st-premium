    <p>Once scarcer than hen’s teeth, Sin­ga­pore chefs who head restau­rants are not as un­com­mon as they were say, five, six years ago.</p>
    <p>Some, like Han Liguang of Labyrinth and Mal­colm Lee of Can­dlenut, run one Miche­lin-starred restau­rants.</p>
    <p>Bjorn Shen of Ar­ti­choke has a sec­ond life on tele­vi­sion and still man­age to run his restau­rant and a pizza bar, which, of course, is ex­pand­ing.</p>
    <p>There is also Gan Ming Kiat of Mus­tard Seed, whose restau­rant in a sleepy part of Seran­goon Gar­den is im­pos­si­ble to get into, so fer­vent is the clam­our for seats.</p>
    <p>But the in­dus­try needs to re­new it­self; din­ers and writ­ers need new peo­ple to talk and write about.</p>
    <p>So here is a group of Sin­ga­porean chefs step­ping up, head­lin­ing a clutch of newly opened restau­rants.</p>
    <p>They range in age from 26 – that would be Tariq Helou of Fleurette in Ran­goon Road; to 38 – An­gus Chow of soon-to-open Sake Labo in Stan­ley Street.</p>
    <p>If they all have one thing in com­mon, it is that they want to run calm kitchens. And not just be­cause some of them have to cook or plate in front of din­ers. Most of them have weath­ered phys­i­cal or ver­bal abuse in old-school kitchens and are de­ter­mined to veer sharply away from that.</p>
    <p>Are the restau­rants per­fect?</p>
    <p>No, of course not.</p>
    <p>There was that strangely tex­tured sauce that ac­com­pa­nied an other­wise good dish of lamb chops with a Viet­namese vibe at Av­enue 87. It looked like goo. It was fixed that day, in time for din­ner ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Some din­ers, in­clud­ing this one, are baf­fled when served a ham­burg steak as the main course at Fleurette. Rib­eye cap de­serves a bet­ter fate. Dessert – Hokkaido milk ice cream with olive oil poured over it, seems an af­ter-thought.</p>
    <p>Din­ers who or­der Rebel Rebel’s sub­lime whipped lard will also have to or­der sour­dough bread, which comes with but­ter and olive oil. Nei­ther is more com­pelling than the lard. The chef is mulling over how to fix this.</p>
    <p>The other two chefs es­cape scru­tiny only be­cause their restau­rants are just get­ting started, or have yet to open.</p>
    <p>But with a new month comes the op­por­tu­nity to put out a new menu, to think through cour­ses, to pace the meal care­fully, to just do bet­ter.</p>
    <p>Much is ex­pected of th­ese chefs. With Sin­ga­pore­ans trapped here and un­able to travel, cri­tiquing new restau­rants has be­come the lat­est blood sport.</p>
    <p>With any luck, all six chefs will rise to the chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Let’s see who is still stand­ing a year from to­day.</p>
