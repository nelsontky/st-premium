    <p>AM­S­TER­DAM • It is not ideal, but with Vir­gil van Dijk out for the long term, Liver­pool have only two recog­nised se­nior cen­tre-backs at the mo­ment, so Fabinho will have to fill in at the back un­til the Jan­uary trans­fer win­dow opens.</p>
    <p>It is, how­ever, a position the Brazil mid­fielder is fa­mil­iar with, hav­ing played there on nu­mer­ous oc­ca­sions the past two sea­sons and as re­cently as the Reds’ 2-0 Premier League win at Chelsea last month.</p>
    <p>Jur­gen Klopp again pressed Fabinho into ac­tion as an emer­gency cen­tre-back in the ab­sence of van Dijk and Joel Matip on Wed­nes­day, and the Liver­pool man­ager was not sur­prised at how com­fort­able the 27-year-old looked along­side Joe Gomez.</p>
    <p>Fabinho coped with ev­ery­thing Ajax could throw at him, mak­ing a su­perb clear­ance off the line be­fore half-time to deny Du­san Tadic and help­ing Liver­pool to a 1-0 Cham­pi­ons League Group D open­ing vic­tory.</p>
    <p>“Was there pres­sure on the sit­u­a­tion? Yes, it’s clear for the two in the back, 100 per cent... Fabinho can play the position, he likes play­ing it,” Klopp, whose side were in­debted to an own goal by Ni­co­las Tagli­afico, told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“I’m not sur­prised he plays well in the position, oth­er­wise we would have thought about a dif­fer­ent so­lu­tion, even when that would have been prop­erly tricky. I’m re­ally pleased for him... it gave him con­fi­dence, for sure helped us.</p>
    <p>“If I would have asked him to play right-back, I don’t think he’d en­joy it as much as he’s en­joy­ing cen­tre­half. In our sit­u­a­tion, we have to keep the boys fit and then they can, of course, help us a lot.”</p>
    <p>For­mer Reds striker Michael Owen agreed, telling BT Sport that he had no doubts over whether Fabinho will be able to hold the fort.</p>
    <p>“All the ques­tions have been about van Dijk and (goal­keeper) Alis­son be­ing out,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Fabinho’s a de­fen­sive mid­fielder, and used to see­ing things and sniff­ing out dan­ger. He was the</p>
    <p>cat­a­lyst in tak­ing the de­fen­sive line deeper.”</p>
    <p>On keep­ing a clean sheet for just the third time this sea­son, Klopp added: “It was not per­fect but they fought bril­liantly. We did not take our chances, which was a shame, and Ajax had a big one which hit the post.</p>
    <p>“When you’re 1-0 up, these things can hap­pen. But over­all, I’m happy with the game. It was not sun­shine foot­ball but we wanted three points and we got it.”</p>
    <p>Klopp also de­cided not to risk any fur­ther in­juries – mid­fielder</p>
    <p>Thi­ago Al­can­tara was also out – and sub­sti­tuted his at­tack­ing tri­dent of Mo­hamed Salah, Sa­dio Mane and Roberto Firmino with an hour gone at a sod­den Am­s­ter­dam Arena.</p>
    <p>“I think both teams can play bet­ter foot­ball, it was pretty wild at mo­ments,” the Ger­man told BT Sport.</p>
    <p>“The pitch was tricky, deep, muddy a lit­tle bit, both teams looked ex­hausted pretty early.</p>
    <p>“Three days ago, it looked com­pletely dif­fer­ent in train­ing too but it was the same for Ajax.”</p>
