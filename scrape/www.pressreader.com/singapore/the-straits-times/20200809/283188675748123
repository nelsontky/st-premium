    <p>On July 20, Mr S. Jais­hankar, Min­is­ter of Ex­ter­nal Af­fairs, af­firmed at a con­fer­ence that In­dia would not be join­ing any al­liance in the fu­ture. This an­nounce­ment came as a sur­prise when there were ex­pec­ta­tions of In­dia grad­u­ally join­ing the US camp, as its stand­off with China con­tin­ued.</p>
    <p>Thus, spec­u­la­tion con­cern­ing In­dian strat­egy to limit an as­sertive and ag­gres­sive China has resur­faced again.</p>
    <p>Although the min­is­ter has not said so, it can be in­ferred that In­dia will limit and coun­ter­bal­ance China through an in­for­mal al­liance. This in­fer­ence is for the fol­low­ing rea­sons.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter said In­dia had sur­passed the era of non-align­ment that was de­signed for a par­tic­u­lar time and geopo­lit­i­cal land­scape.</p>
    <p>But, in the cur­rent mul­ti­po­lar world, a pol­icy of neu­tral­ity is not an ap­pro­pri­ate and ef­fec­tive strat­egy for In­dia, as China ques­tions In­dia’s sta­tus quo in the In­dian Ocean and South Asia.</p>
    <p>Mr Jais­hankar em­pha­sised that In­dia is not as weak as it was in its early decades of in­de­pen­dence. It has been a prom­i­nent player in recog­nis­ing and solv­ing con­tem­po­rary in­ter­na­tional is­sues such as cli­mate change and ter­ror­ism. So, to en­hance its global lever­age, In­dia has to ex­ploit the in­ter­na­tional op­por­tu­ni­ties with risks, con­fi­dence and bet­ter ar­tic­u­la­tion of na­tional in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>Thus, in­di­cat­ing that if and when a ris­ing and as­sertive China be­comes an in­ter­na­tional is­sue, and if this is­sue co­in­cides with In­dian in­ter­ests, In­dia would not hes­i­tate in ac­tively lim­it­ing China. How­ever, con­sid­er­ing its na­tional in­ter­ests and au­ton­omy, In­dia can nei­ther stay neu­tral nor join an al­liance.</p>
    <p>Thus, based on its in­de­pen­dent be­hav­iour and abil­ity to take risks, In­dia will be ac­tively co­or­di­nat­ing with oth­ers to tackle in­ter­na­tional is­sues such as China’s rise and as­sertive­ness, as seen with its in­creas­ing co­or­di­na­tion with</p>
    <p>Quad mem­bers.</p>
    <p>An­to­nio Car­pio Philip­pine Daily In­quirer, The Philip­pines</p>
    <p>The July 12, 2016 ar­bi­tral award that in­val­i­dated China’s nine-dash line claim to wa­ters and re­sources in the South China Sea cat­e­gor­i­cally de­clared that China never con­trolled the South China Sea at any time in his­tory.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte, how­ever, has re­peat­edly de­clared that China is “in pos­ses­sion” of the West Philip­pines Sea.</p>
    <p>The West Philip­pines Sea is a part of the South China Sea, which is the larger sea. The West Philip­pines</p>
    <p>Sea com­prises the ter­ri­to­rial sea, ex­clu­sive eco­nomic zone (EEZ), and ex­tended con­ti­nen­tal shelf (ECS) of the Philip­pines, wa­ters and re­sources over which the Philip­pines has sovereignt­y or sov­er­eign rights.</p>
    <p>The ram­i­fi­ca­tions when Mr Duterte de­clares that China is “in pos­ses­sion” of the West Philip­pines Sea are that he di­rectly con­tra­dicts the award, which ruled that China never con­trolled the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>The US, the UK, France, Aus­tralia, Canada, Ja­pan and In­dia reg­u­larly con­duct free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion and over­flight oper­a­tions (Fonops) in the South China Sea, in­clud­ing in Philip­pine EEZ and ECS in the West Philip­pines Sea. These Fonops vividly demon­strate to the world that China is not in pos­ses­sion of the West Philip­pines Sea.</p>
    <p>What should Filipinos do now? The Depart­ment of For­eign Af­fairs should im­me­di­ately is­sue a clar­i­fi­ca­tion that China is in fact not in pos­ses­sion, and legally can never be in pos­ses­sion, of the West Philip­pines Sea.</p>
    <p>Amish Raj Mulmi</p>
    <p>The Kath­mandu Post, Nepal Sixty-five years to the day that Mr Sar­dar Gunja Man Singh and am­bas­sador Yuan Zhongx­ian signed the agree­ment and es­tab­lished diplo­matic re­la­tions be­tween Nepal and the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China, Kath­mandu’s turn to the north is more of a re­al­ity now than ever.</p>
    <p>Nepal has viewed China from two pri­mary lenses: one, that China pro­vides po­lit­i­cal and in­ter­na­tional back­ing against a hege­monic In­dia; two, that Nepal can profit from China’s eco­nomic progress, through aid and in­vest­ment, and thus can be­come an al­ter­na­tive to Nepal’s land­locked­ness vis-a-vis In­dia.</p>
    <p>While reams have been writ­ten by Nepali schol­ars analysing what China can do for Nepal, rarely has the dis­course shifted to­wards what Bei­jing wants from Kath­mandu.</p>
    <p>For, un­like Nepal’s un­chang­ing dis­course vis-a-vis China, Bei­jing’s ap­proach has con­stantly evolved over time as its own am­bi­tions have grown.</p>
    <p>In the be­gin­ning, Bei­jing’s pri­mary con­cern was the 1856 treaty be­tween Nepal and Ti­bet that dealt with the lat­ter as an in­de­pen­dent state. When China as­sumed con­trol of Ti­bet in 1950, it needed to can­cel all such past treaties that al­lowed Ti­bet a de facto recog­ni­tion of sovereignt­y.</p>
    <p>Thus, a Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry doc­u­ment out­lined the ab­ro­ga­tion of the treaty as one of Bei­jing’s key is­sues with Nepal just be­fore the 1955 Asian-African Con­fer­ence in Ban­dung, In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Now, as the US-China con­test sharp­ens, Bei­jing’s ex­pec­ta­tions from Nepal can best be read in Mr Xi Jin­ping’s op-ed, pub­lished be­fore his visit, and the re­cent press re­lease, post-For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi’s meet­ing with rep­re­sen­ta­tives from Nepal, Afghanista­n and Pak­istan.</p>
    <p>China would like to see lim­ited In­dian am­bi­tions in the neigh­bour­hood, and the 2015 In­dian block­ade was a most op­por­tune mo­ment it cap­i­talised upon.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has also never been as po­lit­i­cally in­vested in Nepal as in the present day. But de­spite these two is­sues, China is equally am­bi­tious about reach­ing out to the mas­sive In­dian mar­kets through Nepal; a re­cent op-ed by a former am­bas­sador sug­gested the rai­son d’etre for the train from Ti­bet would be such.</p>
    <p>At the same time, China val­ues Nepali sup­port for Bei­jing’s po­si­tion in in­ter­na­tional fo­rums vis-a-vis the con­test with the US.</p>
    <p>By do­ing so, China has po­si­tioned it­self as a re­spon­si­ble world power. It has also suc­cess­fully couched its own in­ter­ests within this dis­course.</p>
    <p>The be­lief that China as­sists Nepal out of only neigh­bourly con­cern is naive at best.</p>
    <p>Wang Zhengxu and Tessy Yue Li China Daily, China</p>
    <p>Some US politi­cians are busy try­ing to drive a wedge be­tween China and South-east Asian by mak­ing ef­forts to flare up ten­sions in the South China Sea. But China and its South-east Asian neigh­bours are fully aware of the im­por­tance of main­tain­ing re­gional peace and pro­mot­ing eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The re­cently con­cluded 36th Asean Sum­mit pro­jected the com­mit­ment of Asean and its part­ner economies to sign­ing the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP) agree­ment later this year. This is pos­i­tive news amid the dire sit­u­a­tion the world is fac­ing due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and the</p>
    <p>US-China dis­putes.</p>
    <p>Asean mem­ber states know that so­lu­tions to the ter­ri­to­rial dis­putes in the South China Sea de­pend on ne­go­ti­a­tions, not on the US’ ob­ses­sion to check China’s rise.</p>
    <p>The progress of the RCEP is the lat­est in­di­ca­tion of such a re­al­i­sa­tion. Com­pared with Europe, the re­gional in­te­gra­tion pro­ject didn’t take off in East Asia un­til the re­cent past.</p>
    <p>Even the highly im­pres­sive eco­nomic per­for­mance of Ja­pan and the Four Asian Tigers – the Repub­lic of Korea, Sin­ga­pore, and Tai­wan and Hong Kong – from the 1970s to the 1990s was not ac­com­pa­nied, or fol­lowed, by the emer­gence of any for­mal re­gional eco­nomic struc­ture.</p>
    <p>The 1997-98 Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis was a turn­ing point.</p>
    <p>East Asian lead­ers re­alised that greater eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion was nec­es­sary to de­fend the re­gion against global eco­nomic tur­bu­lences. That China was de­vel­op­ing into a global eco­nomic heavy­weight at the turn of the cen­tury was an added ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>At the Manila sum­mit be­tween Asean and China in 1999, Mr Zhu Rongji, then the Chi­nese Pre­mier, pro­posed de­vel­op­ing an Asean-China free trade zone. For­mal talks pro­gressed rather rapidly and an agree­ment was signed in 2002. Which prompted Ja­pan and South Korea to fol­low suit, and a web of bi­lat­eral and mul­ti­lat­eral trade agree­ments were inked in the fol­low­ing decade, with coun­tries such as In­dia, Aus­tralia, New Zealand and the United States join­ing in.</p>
    <p>The 10+3 (or Asean plus China, Ja­pan and South Korea) mech­a­nism has since been the bedrock of East Asian in­te­gra­tion pro­ject. But while re­la­tions among Asean mem­ber states and those be­tween Asean and China, Ja­pan and South Korea are gen­er­ally cor­dial, the dif­fer­ences among the “three” have be­come a prob­lem.</p>
    <p>The East Asia Sum­mit best re­flects the con­trast­ing po­si­tions of China and Ja­pan. Ini­tially, it was a forum along­side the 10+3 meet­ing and in­cluded In­dia, Aus­tralia and New Zealand (10+6), and later Rus­sia and the US (10+8).</p>
    <p>China and most Asean mem­ber states want to build a re­gional com­mu­nity through the 10+3 plat­form be­fore ex­pand­ing it to in­clude more coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan, how­ever, ap­pears to be in favour of a pan-re­gional com­mu­nity on the lines of 10+6 or 10+8, as it wants coun­tries such as In­dia, Aus­tralia and the US to be part of such a com­mu­nity to coun­ter­bal­ance China. Also, Ja­pan has not shown enough in­ter­est in es­tab­lish­ing a free trade zone with China and South Korea.</p>
    <p>The RCEP, which is aimed at an eco­nomic part­ner­ship in­stead of a supra­na­tional com­mu­nity, has su­per­seded the more am­bi­tious East Asian Com­mu­nity pro­ject.</p>
    <p>Yet Ja­pan is more ac­tive in shap­ing the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (CPTPP), which ex­cludes China and South Korea and there­fore could be seen as an at­tempt to check China’s rise.</p>
    <p>De­spite such dif­fi­cul­ties, it is clear that cre­at­ing a stronger re­gional in­sti­tu­tional ar­chi­tec­ture will bring many ben­e­fits for East Asia, in­clud­ing bet­ter han­dling of re­gional chal­lenges such as se­cu­rity-re­lated is­sues.</p>
