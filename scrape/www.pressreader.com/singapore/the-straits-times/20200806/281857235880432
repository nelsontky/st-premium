    <p>BEI­JING/WASH­ING­TON • China’s State Coun­cil­lor and For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi yes­ter­day said the Chi­nese side is ready to en­ter into can­did and ef­fec­tive con­sul­ta­tion with the Amer­i­can side, as well as make cool-headed and sen­si­ble re­sponse to the im­pul­sive moves and anx­i­ety of the United States.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang made the re­marks in an ex­clu­sive in­ter­view on China-US ties with Xinhua News.</p>
    <p>“The as­ser­tion that US pol­icy of en­gage­ment with China has failed is just a re­hash of the Cold War men­tal­ity,” Mr Wang said. “It turns a blind eye to all that has been achieved in China-US re­la­tions over the past decades, shows ig­no­rance of the his­tor­i­cal process and lack of re­spect for the Chi­nese and Amer­i­can peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wang added that over the past 40 years since the two coun­tries es­tab­lished diplo­matic ties, sev­eral gen­er­a­tions of Chi­nese and Amer­i­cans have worked to­gether to ad­vance China-US re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>“As a re­sult, bi­lat­eral ties have be­come one of the most deeply in­ter­wo­ven re­la­tion­ships in the world with broad­est co­op­er­a­tion ar­eas and most ex­ten­sive com­mon in­ter­ests,” said Mr Wang.</p>
    <p>“It is nei­ther nec­es­sary nor pos­si­ble for the two sides to change each other. In­stead, we should re­spect the choice in­de­pen­dently made by the peo­ple of the other side.”</p>
    <p>He said China’s ma­jor achieve­ments in the past decades show the path of so­cial­ism with Chi­nese char­ac­ter­is­tics fits the coun­try, and has also ben­e­fited the world. “Any­one who at­tempts to de­rail this process can only end in fail­ure,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang’s com­ments came as US-China ties have quickly de­te­ri­o­rated this year over a range of is­sues, in­clud­ing tit-for-tat con­sulate clo­sures, Bei­jing’s han­dling of the coron­avirus, China’s ter­ri­to­rial claims in the South China Sea, and the clam­p­down on Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>In March, the US slashed the num­ber of Chi­nese na­tion­als al­lowed to work at the US of­fices of ma­jor Chi­nese state-owned me­dia from 160 to 100. China ex­pelled US jour­nal­ists from three US news­pa­pers and has threat­ened to match any more US ac­tions against Chi­nese jour­nal­ists.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, the Chi­nese am­bas­sador to the US said Bei­jing does not want ten­sions with Wash­ing­ton to es­ca­late fur­ther. The world’s top two economies should work to co­op­er­ate in­stead of con­fronting each other, Mr Cui Tiankai said, strik­ing a rel­a­tively con­cil­ia­tory tone at the vir­tual Aspen Se­cu­rity Fo­rum.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think a new Cold War would serve any­body’s in­ter­est,” said Mr Cui, seen as a mod­er­ate voice among Bei­jing’s top diplo­matic brass. “Why should we al­low his­tory to re­peat (it­self)... when we are faced with so many new chal­lenges?” he said, while re­ject­ing US al­le­ga­tions of Chi­nese spy­ing in the Hous­ton con­sulate shut down by Wash­ing­ton last month.</p>
    <p>Mr Cui also pushed back on Wash­ing­ton’s al­le­ga­tions that Bei­jing was em­ploy­ing in­tim­i­da­tion tac­tics across the South China Sea and said in­ten­si­fy­ing US mil­i­tary ac­tiv­i­ties in the re­gion were rais­ing the risk of a po­ten­tial con­fronta­tion.</p>
    <p>Asked about Tik­Tok, the Chi­nese-owned short-video app that Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has threat­ened to ban from Sept 15 un­less there is a sale to an­other firm out­side of China, Mr Cui said there was no ev­i­dence that the com­pany was shar­ing in­for­ma­tion with the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Cui’s com­ments came af­ter a July 23 pol­icy speech in Cal­i­for­nia by US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo, who de­scribed get­ting Bei­jing to change its ways as “the mis­sion of our time”.</p>
    <p>De­spite the ten­sions, Mr Cui said that Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing are mov­ing along on their phase one trade deal. “The two eco­nomic teams have been in con­tact with each other at var­i­ous lev­els... and we are mak­ing progress,” he said.</p>
