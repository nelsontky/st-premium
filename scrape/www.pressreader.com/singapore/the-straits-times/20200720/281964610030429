    <p>The Fam­ily Justice Courts (FJC) is plan­ning to in­tro­duce a sim­pler way for a per­son to take a for­mer spouse to court for fail­ing to al­low ac­cess to the chil­dren after the break­down of the mar­riage de­spite be­ing or­dered to do so.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, the en­force­ment of ac­cess or­ders comes in the form of com­mit­tal pro­ceed­ings “which can be lengthy and oner­ous, with strict pro­ce­dural steps that have to be com­plied with”, an FJC spokesman told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Ac­cess or­ders are court or­ders giv­ing the par­ent who does not live with the child the time to spend with him or her after the di­vorce or sep­a­ra­tion. Com­mit­tal pro­ceed­ings seek to pun­ish a per­son for not com­ply­ing with a court or­der.</p>
    <p>The spokesman said the FJC is work­ing out de­tails of the sim­pler process which “will al­low a party who has been de­nied ac­cess to seek the help and in­ter­ven­tion of the court and trained coun­sel­lors more read­ily”.</p>
    <p>Lawyer Dorothy Tan ex­plained the oner­ous process of en­forc­ing the ac­cess or­der.</p>
    <p>The or­der, which comes with a pe­nal no­tice warn­ing of the con­se­quences of non-com­pli­ance, has to be served in per­son to the par­ent who has de­nied ac­cess.</p>
    <p>This means the par­ent who was served the or­der must ac­knowl­edge his or her iden­tity and re­ceive it in per­son. It is usu­ally de­liv­ered by the staff of a lawyer.</p>
    <p>Next is a three-stage process, with the first one be­ing an ap­pli­ca­tion to the court for per­mis­sion to start com­mit­tal pro­ceed­ings. This is fol­lowed by the filing of an ap­pli­ca­tion for an or­der for com­mit­tal. The fi­nal stage is when the case is</p>
    <p>heard. There are strict pro­ce­dural re­quire­ments to ad­here to through­out the process.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan said: “The cur­rent process is ex­haust­ing; it is time­and money-con­sum­ing. And it takes at least a cou­ple of months to the con­clu­sion of the fi­nal hear­ing.</p>
    <p>“Mean­while, ac­cess or­ders may con­tinue to be breached and the par­ent does not get to see the child dur­ing all this time.”</p>
    <p>She cited the dif­fi­cul­ties some of her clients faced, such as for­mer spouses go­ing into hid­ing to avoid be­ing per­son­ally served the or­der.</p>
    <p>Lawyer Ra­jan Chet­tiar noted that the cur­rent penal­ties for breach­ing an ac­cess or­der are ei­ther a fine or a jail term.</p>
    <p>He said: “Of­ten, it is a fine and this does not re­solve the ac­cess prob­lem, which con­tin­ues.”</p>
    <p>A per­son can be fined up to $20,000 or jailed for up to one year, or both, for con­tempt of court for breach­ing a court or­der, such as the ac­cess or­der.</p>
    <p>The FJC ac­knowl­edged the lim­i­ta­tions of im­pos­ing a fine or jail term as this may not achieve the de­sired out­come of fa­cil­i­tat­ing ac­cess.</p>
    <p>Its spokesman said: “It may in fact ag­gra­vate the strained re­la­tion­ship be­tween the par­ents, mak­ing it even harder for them to co-par­ent go­ing for­ward. There is there­fore a need to ad­dress the real un­der­ly­ing causes of non-ac­cess by one par­ent in such cases.”</p>
    <p>The FJC is now plan­ning a range of mea­sures – that are “less con­fronta­tional and more fa­cil­i­ta­tive” – to en­cour­age com­pli­ance with ac­cess or­ders.</p>
    <p>Among them are:</p>
    <p>• Ad­di­tional ed­u­ca­tional pro­grammes to in­stil in par­ents the im­por­tance of co-par­ent­ing, among other things.</p>
    <p>• Spe­cialised coun­selling or</p>
    <p>co-me­di­a­tion.</p>
    <p>• Ap­point­ing a par­ent­ing co­or­di­na­tor, who will be a pro­fes­sional trained to re­solve the dif­fer­ences be­tween par­ents and help them to co­op­er­ate in jointly par­ent­ing their chil­dren after the di­vorce.</p>
    <p>• Com­pen­sa­tion of the time and ex­penses in­curred if the par­ent de­faults on pro­vid­ing ac­cess. Com­pen­sa­tion of time refers to a par­ent be­ing given make-up ac­cess ses­sions to re­place missed ones. Some ex­am­ples of ex­penses in­clude rea­son­able travel ex­penses, such as taxi fares, or the cost of tick­ets to at­trac­tions if the other par­ent bought them in ad­vance.</p>
    <p>• The pro­vi­sion of a per­for­mance bond – which is a sum of money de­cided by the courts – by the de­fault­ing party. If the par­ent breaches the or­der again, the money is for­feited.</p>
    <p>These mea­sures have to be in­tro­duced through leg­isla­tive amend­ments, and are ex­pected to come into ef­fect in 2022.</p>
    <p>The FJC spokesman added: “The courts will have the dis­cre­tion to or­der ei­ther im­pris­on­ment or a fine for fail­ure to com­ply with the or­ders made.”</p>
    <p>The mea­sures are among the rec­om­men­da­tions made by the Com­mit­tee to Re­view and En­hance Re­forms in the Fam­ily Justice Sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Lawyers in­ter­viewed cheered the new mea­sures, say­ing that de­nial of ac­cess is a com­mon prob­lem and a more ef­fec­tive en­force­ment regime is crit­i­cally needed.</p>
    <p>Lawyer Ivan Cheong said: “Par­ents have raised con­cerns for all too long that some par­ents ap­pear to be able to breach ac­cess or­ders with im­punity or lit­tle con­se­quence.”</p>
    <p>Mr Cheong felt that a com­bi­na­tion of hard and soft en­force­ment meth­ods should be used for max­i­mum ef­fec­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan said that a sim­pler way to take the par­ent who is deny­ing ac­cess to court is nec­es­sary to en­sure that peo­ple do not get tan­gled up by pro­ce­dural com­pli­ance.</p>
    <p>She added: “Reme­dies should be fo­cused on re-es­tab­lish­ing the con­tact be­tween par­ent and child, even in­volv­ing third par­ties to en­sure this, in the fastest pos­si­ble time.”</p>
    <p>Lawyer Michelle Wood­worth said of ac­cess prob­lems: “The ef­fect of this on a child can have far­reach­ing con­se­quences and for­ever al­ter the child’s re­la­tion­ship with one par­ent.”</p>
