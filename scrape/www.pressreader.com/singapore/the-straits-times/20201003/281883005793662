    <p>COLOMBO • Sri Lanka will not al­low a Pana­ma­nian-reg­is­tered oil tanker stricken off its coast to leave its wa­ters un­til the ves­sel’s own­ers pay a US$2 mil­lion (S$2.7 mil­lion) fire­fight­ing bill, gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials have said.</p>
    <p>The New Di­a­mond, car­ry­ing 270,000 tonnes of crude, was en route from Kuwait to In­dia when an en­gine room ex­plo­sion on Sept 3 killed a Filipino crew­man and set off a mas­sive fire.</p>
    <p>Fire­fight­ers from Sri Lanka and In­dia bat­tled and put out the blaze on the ves­sel, which is now tied to a tug boat and guarded by a Sri Lankan navy ship some 140km east of the In­dian Ocean is­land.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cial sources said the own­ers of the tanker had planned to be­gin tow­ing the stricken ves­sel to the United Arab Emi­rates.</p>
    <p>But Sri Lanka’s Marine En­vi­ron­ment Pro­tec­tion Agency (MEPA) said on Thurs­day the ship can leave only af­ter pay­ing a bill to­talling US$2.38 mil­lion for fire­fight­ing and com­pen­sa­tion for marine pol­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Last week, Sri Lanka had said the tanker’s owner, Liberian-reg­is­tered Porto Em­po­rios Ship­ping, had agreed to pay the fire­fight­ing costs, but on Thurs­day it an­nounced that no pay­ment had yet been re­ceived.</p>
    <p>“MEPA will grant ap­proval to tow the ship away from Sri Lankan wa­ters... once the ne­go­ti­a­tion process (for pay­ment) is com­pleted,” the agency said in a let­ter to the navy. The ves­sel is man­aged by New Ship­ping of Greece.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing 22 crew mem­bers of the New Di­a­mond were res­cued and are in quar­an­tine as a pre­cau­tion against the coro­n­avirus in the south­ern port city of Galle. The ves­sel leaked some of its heavy fuel oil, but sal­vage work­ers have since fixed the rup­ture, the navy said, adding that there was no risk of the crude oil cargo leak­ing.</p>
    <p>Sri Lanka has said it wants to charge the skip­per of the tanker for neg­li­gence and caus­ing pol­lu­tion.</p>
