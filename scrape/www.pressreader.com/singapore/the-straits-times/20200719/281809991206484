    <p>More than 50 cou­ples at­tended a three-hour vir­tual sem­i­nar on fos­ter par­ent­ing in Is­lam yes­ter­day, hear­ing from re­li­gious ex­perts, vet­eran fos­ter par­ents and so­cial work­ers.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, some women wanted to know if un­der Is­lamic law, they would have to wear their head­scarf at home while caring for their fos­ter chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Us­taz Ir­wan Hadi, deputy di­rec­tor from the Of­fice of Mufti at the Is­lamic Re­li­gious Council of Sin­ga­pore (Muis), said that un­der Is­lamic law they will not have to. “Fos­ter­ing is in line with the Is­lamic spirit of en­sur­ing that chil­dren are pro­tected, and brought up in a home filled with love and com­pas­sion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the we­bi­nar, fos­ter par­ent Siti Jami­lah Hamzah, 39, ad­dressed con­cerns some par­ents had about how long it takes for fos­ter chil­dren to set­tle into a new en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery child is dif­fer­ent, and ev­ery child will need a dif­fer­ent amount of time to ad­just, she said.</p>
    <p>“We have to keep on do­ing what we are do­ing and be con­stant,” added Ms Siti, who is a house­wife with three chil­dren, aged seven, 18 and 21, and is fos­ter par­ent to two young chil­dren.</p>
    <p>She added that em­pa­thy and pa­tience are key to mak­ing sure that all chil­dren feel loved and taken care of, and fos­ter par­ents should show as much of that as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>The in­au­gu­ral sem­i­nar, Is­lam And Fos­ter­ing: We­bi­nar 2020, was jointly or­gan­ised by PPIS Oa­sis, a fos­ter­ing agency by the Sin­ga­pore Mus­lim Women’s As­so­ci­a­tion (PPIS), in part­ner­ship with the Sin­ga­pore Is­lamic Schol­ars and Re­li­gious Teach­ers As­so­ci­a­tion (Per­gas).</p>
    <p>Last month, The Straits Times re­ported that the num­ber of chil­dren in fos­ter care in­creased in the past five years, af­ter the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment’s (MSF) ef­forts to place more chil­dren who have been abused, aban­doned or ne­glected un­der the care of fos­ter par­ents in­stead of in a chil­dren’s home.</p>
    <p>There were 545 chil­dren in fos­ter care last year, up from 535 in 2018 and 362 in 2015, and the chil­dren range from ba­bies to those un­der 18 years old.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment Muham­mad Faishal Ibrahim, who at­tended the three-hour-long we­bi­nar, said he was heart­ened by the in­ter­est shown by the com­mu­nity in fos­ter par­ent­ing.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing these dif­fi­cult times, it is all the more im­por­tant that as a so­ci­ety, we band to­gether to help those in need. There are chil­dren out there who could ben­e­fit from be­ing cared for in a lov­ing fos­ter fam­ily,” he said.</p>
