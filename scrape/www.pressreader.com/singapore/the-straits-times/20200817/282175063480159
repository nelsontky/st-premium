    <p>There has been a lot of dis­cus­sion on cy­clists and pedes­tri­ans shar­ing path­ways.</p>
    <p>A com­plete ban on cy­clists us­ing pedes­trian paths is not a prac­ti­cal so­lu­tion. It would be more pru­dent to lay down laws to force both pedes­tri­ans and cy­clists to share the paths with mu­tual re­spect.</p>
    <p>Even though there are some guide­lines now, no one seems to bother about them. It’s com­mon to see cy­clists speed­ing or rid­ing in groups and tak­ing up the whole path.</p>
    <p>Some bikes are fixed with brighter than nec­es­sary front and back lights, which can be blind­ing. Fancy and flash­ing lights should be strictly banned.</p>
    <p>At bus stops where there is no room for a cy­cling path, cy­clists do not dis­mount and push their bikes. I have seen many near ac­ci­dents be­tween bikes and peo­ple alight­ing from or board­ing buses.</p>
    <p>Then there are cy­clists who lock their bikes to the poles of shel­tered walk­ways in­dis­crim­i­nately, block­ing the path of pedes­tri­ans.</p>
    <p>Pedes­tri­ans are equally at fault. It’s com­mon to see three or four peo­ple walk­ing side by side, oc­cu­py­ing the whole path, obliv­i­ous to any­one com­ing from be­hind them.</p>
    <p>Pedes­tri­ans should be ad­vised not to use their smart­phones or have con­ver­sa­tions with friends while stand­ing right in the mid­dle of the path and ob­struct­ing the move­ment of oth­ers.</p>
    <p>If such ba­sic eti­quette and re­spect for oth­ers are dis­re­garded and ig­nored, pu­n­ish­ment and penal­ties are the only way to go.</p>
