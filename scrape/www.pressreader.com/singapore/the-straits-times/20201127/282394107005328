    <p>• In­di­anapo­lis will now host the 2024 Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) Al­lS­tar game, leav­ing next year’s show­case in limbo as the league grap­ples with sched­ul­ing changes due to the coronaviru­s pan­demic, it was an­nounced on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The city was sup­posed to host the 2021 game in Fe­bru­ary but the league said the wors­en­ing Covid-19 health sit­u­a­tion had forced it to resched­ule the event.</p>
    <p>“While we are dis­ap­pointed that the NBA All-Star game will not take place in In­di­anapo­lis in 2021, we are look­ing for­ward to the (Indiana) Pac­ers and the city host­ing the game and sur­round­ing events in 2024,” said NBA com­mis­sioner Adam Sil­ver.</p>
    <p>“I want to thank... the en­tire Pac­ers or­gan­i­sa­tion as well as the NBA All-Star 2021 host com­mit­tee and the com­mu­nity of In­di­anapo­lis for work­ing with us to resched­ule our All-Star ac­tiv­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>No de­tails about next year’s game and whether it will take place were re­leased. Cleve­land will play host in 2022 and Salt Lake City will do so in 2023.</p>
    <p>The 2024 game will be played in Fe­bru­ary at Bankers Life Field­house, the home of the Pac­ers.</p>
    <p>Indiana has seen a spike in coronaviru­s deaths in the past month with a record 103 deaths on Tues­day, tak­ing the state’s to­tal deaths to close to 5,500.</p>
