    <p>The High Court has ap­pointed Grant Thornton Sin­ga­pore as the su­per­vi­sor of Xihe Hold­ings and four of its sub­sidiaries, a source with knowl­edge of the mat­ter said on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The court de­ci­sion fol­lowed an ap­pli­ca­tion by Oversea-Chi­nese Bank­ing Cor­po­ra­tion (OCBC) to place Xihe Hold­ings and the sub­sidiaries un­der the busi­ness ad­viser’s su­per­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim Oon Kuin, also known as O.K. Lim, with his son Evan Lim Chee Meng and daugh­ter Lim Huey Ching, owns 77 com­pa­nies un­der the Xihe group, which con­sists mainly of Xihe Hold­ings and Xihe Cap­i­tal. Xihe Group owns 136 ships rang­ing from coastal barges to very large crude car­ri­ers.</p>
    <p>The sub­sidiaries in­volved are Da Xin Tankers, Hua Guang Ship­ping, Nan King Mar­itime and Hua Xin Ship­ping, and these units to­gether own five ships.</p>
    <p>Xihe Hold­ings is part of the Lim fam­ily busi­ness em­pire, which also in­cludes trou­bled oil trader Hin Leong Trad­ing and fleet man­ager Ocean Tankers, both of which were placed un­der court-ap­pointed su­per­vi­sors ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Hin Leong owed about US$3.6 bil­lion (S$4.9 bil­lion) to 23 banks. The oil trader’s founder O.K. Lim ad­mit­ted he had di­rected the firm to hide about US$800 mil­lion in fu­tures trad­ing losses.</p>
    <p>Xihe Hold­ings, OCBC and Grant Thornton did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to re­quests for com­ment. The source de­clined to be named be­cause of the sen­si­tiv­ity of the is­sue.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments seen ear­lier by The Straits Times, OCBC said it “strongly dis­trusts (Xihe Hold­ings’) cur­rent man­age­ment” after US$208.1 mil­lion was trans­ferred by the Xihe group to Hin Leong “for no valid com­mer­cial pur­pose”.</p>
    <p>OCBC had said that “bare­boat char­ters of OCBC-fi­nanced ves­sels were ter­mi­nated with­out OCBC’s con­sent, and the Xihe units have per­sis­tently failed to... col­lect pay­ments from Ocean Tankers for months or years, to the prej­u­dice of cred­i­tors of the Xihe group, and in breach of con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions owed to OCBC”.</p>
