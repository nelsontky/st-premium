    <p>It may not be per­fect but the civil­i­sa­tion we en­joy to­day would not be pos­si­ble with­out the United Na­tions and its fam­ily of agen­cies and en­ti­ties, says Pro­fes­sor Tommy Koh.</p>
    <p>World War II killed be­tween 70 mil­lion and 80 mil­lion peo­ple and left many coun­tries in ruin. In the af­ter­math, the lead­ers of the vic­to­ri­ous al­lies wanted to build a new world. One of their most im­por­tant ini­tia­tives was to es­tab­lish the United Na­tions in 1945.</p>
    <p>The UN is com­mem­o­rat­ing its 75th an­niver­sary this year. Is it an oc­ca­sion to praise or crit­i­cise the UN? Does it have a bright or bleak fu­ture?</p>
    <p>The UN has a mixed record of suc­cesses and fail­ures. I will be­gin this as­sess­ment by dis­cussing its three big­gest fail­ures.</p>
    <p>FIRST FAIL­URE</p>
    <p>The pre­am­ble of the UN Char­ter states that the UN was founded “to save suc­ceed­ing gen­er­a­tions from the scourge of war”. The UN’s big­gest fail­ure is that it has been un­able to pre­vent the oc­cur­rence of wars and other armed con­flicts.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Upp­sala Con­flict Data Pro­gramme, there have been 285 armed con­flicts since 1945. Ac­cord­ing to the Dutch think-tank, the Clin­gen­dael In­sti­tute, these con­flicts have killed more than 40 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>There are many armed con­flicts in the world to­day, such as those in Afghanista­n, So­ma­lia, Su­dan, South Su­dan, Libya and Syria.</p>
    <p>The Syr­ian civil war has been rag­ing since 2011. To date, it has killed be­tween 400,000 and 500,000 peo­ple. The UN es­ti­mates that six mil­lion Syr­i­ans have been dis­placed and 5.6 mil­lion of them have sought refuge abroad. The in­abil­ity of the UN to bring the civil war to an end, owing to dis­agree­ment among the five per­ma­nent mem­bers of its Se­cu­rity Coun­cil (the Big Five), is a dis­grace.</p>
    <p>SEC­OND FAIL­URE</p>
    <p>The sec­ond fail­ure of the UN is its in­abil­ity or un­will­ing­ness to pro­tect mi­nori­ties from be­ing killed or op­pressed by the ma­jor­ity. This hap­pened in Rwanda in 1994, and in Sre­brenica in 1995.</p>
    <p>In the case of Rwanda, the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil chose not to act be­cause the Big Five did not have a strate­gic in­ter­est in the con­flict. In the case of Sre­brenica, the UN did not in­ter­vene be­cause of dis­agree­ment among the Big Five and be­cause the UN did not have the guts to fight the mur­der­ers.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Court of Jus­tice is cur­rently con­sid­er­ing a case against Myan­mar for geno­cide against the coun­try’s Ro­hingya mi­nor­ity.</p>
    <p>THIRD FAIL­URE</p>
    <p>The third fail­ure of the UN is the dys­func­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil. At the San Fran­cisco con­fer­ence to draft the UN Char­ter, the five great pow­ers – the United States, Bri­tain, France, the Soviet Union and China – de­manded per­ma­nent seats in the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil and the power to veto or kill any res­o­lu­tion be­fore the coun­cil. The other coun­tries were told to ac­cept these de­mands or there would be no char­ter.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil works beau­ti­fully when the in­ter­ests of the Big Five are aligned. How­ever, on most oc­ca­sions, they have di­ver­gent in­ter­ests. When this hap­pens, the coun­cil is paral­ysed and un­able to act. This is why the coun­cil is im­po­tent in the face of the daily slaugh­ter and de­struc­tion in Syria.</p>
    <p>FIRST SUCCESS</p>
    <p>The UN can claim many success sto­ries dur­ing the past 75 years. Let me men­tion seven of the most im­por­tant. The first success is to cre­ate a safer world for small coun­tries. The char­ter con­fers equal rights on coun­tries big and small. In the Gen­eral As­sem­bly, every mem­ber coun­try has one vote. Sin­ga­pore is the found­ing chair­man of the Forum of Small States, which has 108 mem­bers.</p>
    <p>SEC­OND SUCCESS</p>
    <p>The sec­ond success is to build a new world or­der, based on the rule of law and the peace­ful set­tle­ment of dis­putes, in ac­cor­dance with in­ter­na­tional law. This was a rev­o­lu­tion­ary change from the old or­der, which was based on the prin­ci­ple that might is right.</p>
    <p>An ex­am­ple of the new or­der at work was the de­ci­sion by the UN to de­fend Kuwait against Iraq.</p>
    <p>Iraq had in­vaded Kuwait and sought to make it part of Iraq. Be­cause of the UN’s in­ter­ven­tion, Kuwait was lib­er­ated from Iraqi oc­cu­pa­tion.</p>
    <p>We should there­fore stop quot­ing Thucy­dides, who said it was the des­tiny of small coun­tries to suf­fer the ag­gres­sion of big coun­tries.</p>
    <p>THIRD SUCCESS</p>
    <p>The third success of the UN was the proac­tive and con­struc­tive role it played in help­ing coun­tries and peo­ples un­der colo­nial rule to gain the right to self-de­ter­mi­na­tion and in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>In 1945, when the UN was founded, it had only 51 mem­bers. To­day, the UN has 193 mem­bers.</p>
    <p>In 1945, 750 mil­lion peo­ple, a third of the world’s pop­u­la­tion, lived un­der colo­nial rule. To­day, fewer than two mil­lion peo­ple do.</p>
    <p>FOURTH SUCCESS</p>
    <p>The fourth success of the UN is in the field of hu­man rights. Af­ter the hor­rors of World War II, it was de­ter­mined to make a fresh start. The pre­am­ble of the UN Char­ter reaf­firms “faith in fun­da­men­tal hu­man rights, in the dig­nity and worth of the hu­man per­son, and in the equal rights of men and women”.</p>
    <p>Over the past 75 years, the UN has adopted the Univer­sal Dec­la­ra­tion of Hu­man Rights; the Covenants on Civil and Po­lit­i­cal Rights and on So­cial, Cul­tural and Eco­nomic Rights; con­ven­tions against geno­cide, tor­ture and slav­ery; con­ven­tions to end racial dis­crim­i­na­tion and dis­crim­i­na­tion against women; con­ven­tions on the rights of the child and the dis­abled; and much more.</p>
    <p>Mem­ber states have to ap­pear, pe­ri­od­i­cally, be­fore the UN Hu­man Rights Coun­cil and ac­count for their hu­man rights record. How­ever, en­force­ment is a weak­ness. This is be­cause the coun­cil is highly politi­cised. Whether a coun­try is cen­sured or not de­pends less on the merit of the case and more on how many friends it has in the coun­cil.</p>
    <p>FIFTH SUCCESS</p>
    <p>The fifth success is due to the net­work of UN agen­cies and other en­ti­ties which cover every field of hu­man en­deav­our. Let me give some ex­am­ples.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Mar­itime Or­gan­i­sa­tion and the In­ter­na­tional Civil Avi­a­tion Or­gan­i­sa­tion make rules to gov­ern in­ter­na­tional ship­ping and in­ter­na­tional civil avi­a­tion, re­spec­tively. The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion is in­dis­pens­able in pro­tect­ing the health of the peo­ple of the world. The World Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Or­gan­i­sa­tion is play­ing a lead­ing role on cli­mate change. And with­out the In­ter­na­tional Telecom­mu­ni­ca­tion Union, there would be no in­ter­na­tional mo­bile calls.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Labour Or­gan­i­sa­tion pro­tects the rights of work­ers, in­clud­ing the right to a min­i­mum wage. The UN Chil­dren’s Fund sup­ports child health and nutri­tion and pro­vided free milk for poor chil­dren in Sin­ga­pore in the 1950s. The Food and Agri­cul­tural Or­gan­i­sa­tion, the World Food Pro­gramme and the In­ter­na­tional Atomic En­ergy Agency have also be­come in­dis­pens­able.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, a Sin­ga­porean, Mr Daren Tang, was elected as the direc­tor-gen­eral of the World In­tel­lec­tual Prop­erty Or­gan­i­sa­tion. He is the first Sin­ga­porean to be elected head of a UN agency.</p>
    <p>SIXTH SUCCESS</p>
    <p>The sixth success of the UN is in the pro­tec­tion of our en­vi­ron­ment and our global com­mons, such as the oceans. The UN Con­ven­tion on the Law of the Sea is a com­pre­hen­sive treaty which gov­erns all as­pects of oceans and its re­sources. It is also to pre­vent the oceans from be­ing pol­luted, de­graded and over-ex­ploited.</p>
    <p>The UN has adopted a treaty to pro­tect our van­ish­ing bi­o­log­i­cal di­ver­sity. The UN has also adopted two treaties to pro­tect our cli­mate sys­tem against global warm­ing and cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>The UN En­vi­ron­ment Pro­gramme should be up­graded to the sta­tus of a UN agency, given its im­por­tant role. Its man­date is noth­ing short of en­sur­ing that the earth is in good health and can sus­tain the hu­man civil­i­sa­tion. Na­ture is the source of hu­man health.</p>
    <p>The UN has con­vened, every 20 years, a ma­jor con­fer­ence on the en­vi­ron­ment. These con­fer­ences have raised the world’s aware­ness about the im­por­tance of the en­vi­ron­ment. It has also gal­vanised the po­lit­i­cal will to take col­lec­tive ac­tion to pro­tect our bio­di­ver­sity, cli­mate and oceans.</p>
    <p>SEV­ENTH SUCCESS</p>
    <p>The sev­enth success is the UN’s peace­keep­ing op­er­a­tions. In recog­ni­tion of its con­tri­bu­tions to peace, it was awarded the No­bel Peace Prize in 1998.</p>
    <p>The first peace­keep­ing op­er­a­tion was launched in 1948, to sep­a­rate the forces of Is­rael and the Arab coun­tries. In 1949, the UN es­tab­lished the sec­ond peace­keep­ing force to sep­a­rate the forces of In­dia and Pak­istan and to mon­i­tor the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Since 1945, the UN has com­pleted 57 peace­keep­ing op­er­a­tions. There are cur­rently 14 such op­er­a­tions, in­clud­ing the two es­tab­lished in 1948 and 1949. Sin­ga­pore’s sol­diers and po­lice of­fi­cers have par­tic­i­pated in 15 such op­er­a­tions in Asia, Africa and Latin Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>CON­CLU­SION</p>
    <p>The UN is not per­fect and I have de­scribed three of its fail­ures. How­ever, the world body has many more suc­cesses than fail­ures. The civil­i­sa­tion we en­joy would not be pos­si­ble with­out the UN and its fam­ily of agen­cies and en­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>Go­ing for­ward, the UN should seek to de­liver on its sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment goals. It should lis­ten to its lov­ing crit­ics and re­form its in­sti­tu­tions to im­prove their rel­e­vance and ef­fi­ciency.</p>
    <p>The UN should also be a thought leader on new devel­op­ments, in­clud­ing the dig­i­tal econ­omy, smart cities, cy­ber se­cu­rity, cy­ber war­fare, ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, ro­bot­ics, hu­man genome edit­ing and ex­ter­nal in­ter­fer­ence in elec­tions.</p>
    <p>But at the same time, it should work harder at tack­ling some of the old prob­lems, such as the preven­tion of armed con­flict, the pro­tec­tion of mi­nori­ties, the per­sis­tence of poverty and un­der-de­vel­op­ment and grow­ing in­equal­ity, both within and be­tween coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The UN should also fight against the forces of dark­ness which are at­tack­ing open economies, free trade, in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion, re­gional eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion and mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism. They want to take us back to the pre-1945 world. We must not let them suc­ceed. Tommy Koh is a pro­fes­sor of law at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore and an am­bas­sador-at-large at the Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs. He was Sin­ga­pore’s per­ma­nent rep­re­sen­ta­tive to the United Na­tions for 13 years and was the pres­i­dent of the Third UN Con­fer­ence on the Law of the Sea.</p>
