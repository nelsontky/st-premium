    <p>World rank­ing:</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>Best Slam re­sult: Win­ner (US Open 2020) Best French Open re­sult: Run­ner-up (2018, 2019)</p>
    <p>Thiem was la­belled the flag-bearer for the next gen­er­a­tion but fell short in three fi­nals on the big­gest stage. He fi­nally got his break at Flush­ing Mead­ows ear­lier this month, win­ning his first Grand Slam ti­tle days af­ter turn­ing 27.</p>
    <p>The Aus­trian base­liner, known for one of the most pow­er­ful sin­gle-handed back­hands in the game, reached the fi­nal at Roland Gar­ros the last two years – only to lose against Rafael Nadal.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, his ground­strokes and abil­ity to win long ral­lies make clay the ideal sur­face for Thiem to win his sec­ond Ma­jor.</p>
    <p>World rank­ing: 7</p>
    <p>Best Slam re­sult: Run­ner-up (US Open 2020) Best French Open re­sult: Q-fi­nals (2018, 2019)</p>
    <p>A main­stay in the top five in re­cent years, Zverev’s stock fell un­til he reached the US Open fi­nal. He was one set away from his first Grand Slam ti­tle, be­fore it all fell apart in the fi­nal against Thiem.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old re­lies on a fiery first serve and pow­er­ful ground­strokes. But the Ger­man lacks that same cut­ting edge on his sec­ond serve to pose a threat on clay.</p>
    <p>How­ever, two Masters ti­tles on clay and two quar­ter-fi­nal ap­pear­ances at Roland Gar­ros in the last two years will fill him with con­fi­dence head­ing into the fi­nal Grand Slam of the year.</p>
    <p>DIEGO SCHWARTZ­MAN (ARG)</p>
    <p>World rank­ing: 13</p>
    <p>Best Slam re­sult: Q-fi­nals (French Open 2018, US Open 2017 & 2019)</p>
    <p>Best French Open re­sult: Q-fi­nals (2018)</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old missed the chance to break into the world’s top 10 for the first time when he lost to No­vak Djokovic in the fi­nal in Rome last week.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the diminu­tive Ar­gen­tine will take so­lace in the fact that he got the bet­ter of Nadal in their quar­ter-fi­nal.</p>
    <p>A counter-puncher who uses his speed and agility to cover the court well, Schwartz­man’s game is suited to clay­courts, where his de­fen­sive abil­i­ties cre­ate nu­mer­ous at­tack­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties and pass­ing shots.</p>
