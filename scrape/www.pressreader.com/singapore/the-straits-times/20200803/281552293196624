    <p>Tough new re­stric­tions have been im­posed in Mel­bourne and the Aus­tralian state of Vic­to­ria amid a con­tin­ued spike in coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions. The re­stric­tions in Mel­bourne in­clude a night-time cur­few and lim­its on how far res­i­dents can move out of their homes.</p>
    <p>MEL­BOURNE • Tough new re­stric­tions, in­clud­ing a night-time cur­few, were in­tro­duced in Mel­bourne yes­ter­day evening, as coro­n­avirus cases and deaths con­tin­ued to mount in the city and Vic­to­ria Pre­mier Daniel An­drews de­clared a “state of dis­as­ter”.</p>
    <p>Mel­bourne has been placed un­der so-called “stage four” re­stric­tions – the tough­est seen in Aus­tralia so far – fol­low­ing the fail­ure of a city­wide lock­down that be­gan early last month to curb the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>The rest of Vic­to­ria state, of which Mel­bourne is the cap­i­tal, will move from Thurs­day to the same stage three re­stric­tions that had been ap­plied in Mel­bourne.</p>
    <p>The height­ened re­stric­tions will be in force un­til Sept 13.</p>
    <p>The tough step came as the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) warned on Satur­day that the coro­n­avirus pan­demic is likely to be lengthy, and high­lighted the risk of “re­sponse fa­tigue”, given the so­cioe­co­nomic pres­sures on coun­tries, af­ter a meet­ing of its emer­gency com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic is a once-in-acen­tury health cri­sis, the ef­fects of which will be felt for decades to come,” WHO di­rec­tor-gen­eral Tedros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus re­port­edly told the panel, which rec­om­mended a sus­tained at­tack on the virus on all fronts.</p>
    <p>The stage four re­stric­tions in Mel­bourne will see the im­po­si­tion of a cur­few that pro­hibits res­i­dents from leav­ing their homes be­tween 8pm and 5am every night, ex­cept for work or care­giv­ing.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, lim­its have been set that will re­strict shop­pers to within 5km of their homes. Only one per­son from a house­hold will be able to shop at a time, and only once a day.</p>
    <p>Leav­ing the house to ex­er­cise will be per­mit­ted for only one hour a day within a 5km ra­dius, while recre­ational ac­tiv­i­ties such as fish­ing and golf have been banned.</p>
    <p>Restau­rants and cafes are per­mit­ted to con­tinue to of­fer take­away and home de­liv­ery, and liquor shops will re­main open.</p>
    <p>But fur­ther re­stric­tions tar­get­ing work­places will be an­nounced to­day, which could lead to the clo­sure of non-es­sen­tial busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Most stu­dents in Mel­bourne will go back to on­line learn­ing from mid­night on Wed­nes­day, while weddings will be banned. Fu­ner­als will con­tinue to be al­lowed with a max­i­mum of 10 mourn­ers.</p>
    <p>The height­ened re­stric­tions in Vic­to­ria mean restau­rants, cafes, bars and gyms will close from 11.59pm on Wed­nes­day, with peo­ple al­lowed to leave home only for es­sen­tial work, study, care and needed sup­plies.</p>
    <p>“The time for le­niency, the time for warn­ings and cau­tions, is over,” Mr An­drews said yes­ter­day. “If you are not at home and you should be, if you have the virus and are just go­ing about your busi­ness, you will be dealt with harshly. Lives are at stake.”</p>
    <p>He said 671 new coro­n­avirus cases were de­tected in Vic­to­ria over a 24-hour pe­riod, with 6,322 ac­tive in­fec­tions in the state. Seven more peo­ple died, tak­ing the state’s death toll to 123. Aus­tralia’s to­tal in­fec­tions reached al­most 18,000 yes­ter­day, with 208 deaths.</p>
    <p>The state of dis­as­ter dec­la­ra­tion gives the po­lice greater pow­ers and al­lows the au­thor­i­ties to sus­pend Acts of Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral gov­ern­ment backed Vic­to­ria’s mea­sures, with Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son say­ing in a post on his Face­book page that they were “re­gret­tably nec­es­sary”.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia is not the only coun­try tough­en­ing its re­sponse amid the pan­demic. Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son is re­port­edly con­sid­er­ing seal­ing off Greater Lon­don and or­der­ing at-risk mem­bers of the pop­u­la­tion to stay at home un­der a po­ten­tial sce­nario de­signed to avert a se­cond na­tional lock­down.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte has ap­proved plac­ing Metro Manila and nearby prov­inces un­der a so-called “Mod­i­fied En­hanced Com­mu­nity Quar­an­tine” for two weeks from mid­night to­mor­row. The coun­try saw a record sin­gle-day rise in new in­fec­tions of 5,032 yes­ter­day.</p>
