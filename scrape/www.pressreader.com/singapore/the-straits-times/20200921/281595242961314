    <p>More Malaysian writ­ers have been gain­ing in­ter­na­tional recog­ni­tion re­cently. Malaysians are surely grate­ful to au­thor Tan Twan Eng, as his works have kick-started the coun­try’s bur­geon­ing English lit­er­a­ture scene. He is one among a grow­ing brigade of Malaysian writ­ers get­ting in­ter­na­tional ku­dos for their lit­er­ary prow­ess.</p>
    <p>“On a moun­tain above the clouds once lived a man who had been the gar­dener of the Em­peror of Ja­pan.”</p>
    <p>This is the open­ing sen­tence of the po­et­i­cally lan­guorous novel, The Gar­den Of Evening Mists (2012), by Malaysian lit­er­ary gi­ant Tan Twan Eng.</p>
    <p>The novel was de­scribed by The Guardian as “im­pos­si­ble to re­sist... show­cases Tan Twan Eng as a mas­ter of cul­tural com­plex­i­ties”.</p>
    <p>More and more Malaysian writ­ers have been gain­ing in­ter­na­tional recog­ni­tion re­cently. Malaysians are surely grate­ful to Tan for giv­ing up his ca­reer as a lawyer, as his works have kick­started the coun­try’s bur­geon­ing English lit­er­a­ture scene.</p>
    <p>His de­but novel, The Gift Of Rain (2007), was long-listed for the UK’s pres­ti­gious Man Booker Prize.</p>
    <p>His sec­ond book, The Gar­den Of Evening Mists, placed him firmly in the spot­light when he be­came the first Malaysian to win the Man Asian Lit­er­ary Prize in 2012 and the Wal­ter Scott Prize for His­tor­i­cal Fic­tion in 2013.</p>
    <p>Set in post-war Malaya, the story has been turned into an award­win­ning film re­leased this year.</p>
    <p>But the success came af­ter many re­jec­tions by UK pub­lish­ers.</p>
    <p>“It’s a dis­heart­en­ing fact but, over the years, I’ve dis­cov­ered that most pub­lish­ers pre­fer to ex­pend their en­er­gies and bud­get on mar­ket­ing books that re­quire min­i­mal pub­lic­ity – books by big-name au­thors that would sell mil­lions of copies by them­selves with­out any help – be­cause it’s less chal­leng­ing and re­quires no imag­i­na­tive and orig­i­nal ideas,” Tan, 48, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“I per­se­vered be­cause I knew I had writ­ten a good novel,” he said. He even­tu­ally found a new pub­lisher, Myr­mi­don, which liked his book and the rest is his­tory.</p>
    <p>An­other Malaysian book-to­screen is Yangsze Choo’s de­but novel The Ghost Bride (2013), which has been turned into a Net­flix se­ries.</p>
    <p>The for­mer man­age­ment con­sul­tant, who is now a New York Times best­selling nov­el­ist, wrote the his­tor­i­cal fan­tasy set in 1890s Malacca, about a young woman forced to marry a ghost.</p>
    <p>“When I started writ­ing, I ac­tu­ally had very lit­tle idea of how dif­fi­cult or easy it might be to be pub­lished. This was per­haps a good thing be­cause if I’d re­alised how low the odds were, I might never have sub­mit­ted any­thing,” she told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Her ad­vice for as­pir­ing writ­ers? “Write what you find to be deeply fas­ci­nat­ing. If you write what you think other peo­ple like, rather than what you per­son­ally find in­ter­est­ing, it will show in your writ­ing.”</p>
    <p>Choo, 46, who is work­ing on her third book, said it will com­bine el­e­ments of mag­i­cal re­al­ism with his­tor­i­cal fic­tion, like her sec­ond book The Night Tiger (2019).</p>
    <p>“Right now, it’s set in Manchuria (north-east China) dur­ing the last days of the Qing empire in 1905. Writ­ing is al­ways a jour­ney of dis­cov­ery for me though and I don’t know where the book may go — things might change along the way and the char­ac­ters could end up in South-east Asia af­ter all,” she said.</p>
    <p>The list of award-win­ning Malaysian au­thors is slowly grow­ing.</p>
    <p>Among them is fan­tasy au­thor Zen Cho, 34. She is a Craw­ford, Bri­tish Fan­tasy and Hugo award win­ner for her short story col­lec­tion Spir­its Abroad (2014), de­but novel Sorceror To The Crown (2015) and nov­el­ette If At First You Don’t Suc­ceed, Try, Try Again (2018), re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>An­other au­thor, Shih-Li Kow, 52, won a top French lit­er­ary award in 2018, the Prix du Premier Ro­man Etranger (First Novel Award, in the for­eign cat­e­gory) for her de­but novel, The Sum Of Our Fol­lies (2014), which has been trans­lated into Ital­ian and French.</p>
    <p>Saras Man­ickam made waves last year when she was named re­gional win­ner of Asia for the Com­mon­wealth Short Story Prize for My Mother Pattu.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, Hanna Alkaf, 35, bagged the US Free­man Book Award in the Young Adult/High School Lit­er­a­ture cat­e­gory for her de­but novel, The Weight Of Our Sky (2019).</p>
    <p>Her sec­ond book, The Girl And The Ghost (2020) is a fi­nal­ist for the US Kirkus Prize this year in the Young Reader’s Lit­er­a­ture cat­e­gory. The re­sults will be an­nounced on Nov 5.</p>
    <p>While her first book is writ­ten against the back­drop of the 1969 race ri­ots, her sec­ond weaves el­e­ments of lo­cal re­li­gious and cul­tural be­liefs in a story about a girl who in­her­its a dark spirit from her grand­mother and em­braces it as her friend and pro­tec­tor.</p>
    <p>When asked if he had any re­grets on leav­ing the le­gal pro­fes­sion to pur­sue writ­ing, Tan con­ceded that he is some­what en­vi­ous of his friends driv­ing ex­pen­sive cars and own­ing a long list of prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>He said: “I would have been des­per­ately un­happy if I had re­mained a lawyer and I would have been bored silly too. Even as a boy, I was al­ways aware that I had to march to the beat of my own drum.”</p>
    <p>Malaysian writer, pub­lisher and film-maker Amir Muham­mad, said he is happy that Malaysians who write in English are get­ting pub­lished in­ter­na­tion­ally and put it down to “the ta­lent and de­ter­mi­na­tion of the in­di­vid­ual writ­ers them­selves in seek­ing out agents and then fine-tun­ing their manuscript­s”.</p>
    <p>“I also hope Malaysians who write in lan­guages other than English will get good trans­la­tors and agents. Plus, of course, there are other big mar­kets aside from the An­glo­phone one,” he adds.</p>
