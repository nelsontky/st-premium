    <p>A train fault ex­tended trav­el­ling time on the North-South Line (NSL) by 15 min­utes yes­ter­day morn­ing, the sec­ond rail glitch this week.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, an­other train fault length­ened jour­neys on the East­West Line (EWL) by 25 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s fault was raised by Face­book com­mu­nity group Land Trans­port Guru.</p>
    <p>On an­other com­mu­nity site, Tata SMRT, com­muter Mary Lee said she was stuck on board a train for about 10 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Op­er­a­tor SMRT said at about 9.30am yes­ter­day that a train fault had oc­curred be­tween Jurong East and Bukit Ba­tok MRT sta­tions on the North-South Line to­wards Ma­rina South Pier.</p>
    <p>“Com­muters were safely dis­em­barked at Jurong East sta­tion,” said a spokesman for SMRT.</p>
    <p>“The de­fec­tive train was sub­se­quently with­drawn to the de­pot for in­ves­ti­ga­tions.”</p>
    <p>The spokesman added that train ser­vices con­tin­ued to be avail­able, but were slower. Nor­mal train ser­vices pro­gres­sively re­sumed 30 min­utes later, from around 10am.</p>
    <p>For the Tues­day in­ci­dent, the op­er­a­tor said that at about 5.10pm that day, a train fault oc­curred be­tween Chi­nese Gar­den and Jurong East MRT sta­tions on the East</p>
    <p>West Line to­wards Pasir Ris.</p>
    <p>The de­fec­tive train was sub­se­quently with­drawn to the de­pot for in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Videos and pho­to­graphs of the with­drawal were shared on Face­book and YouTube by com­muters.</p>
    <p>SMRT said free reg­u­lar bus ser­vices were made avail­able be­tween Cle­menti and Boon Lay MRT sta­tions in both di­rec­tions on Tues­day. Nor­mal train ser­vices pro­gres­sively re­sumed half an hour later, from around 5.40pm.</p>
    <p>The train op­er­a­tor apol­o­gised for both in­ci­dents.</p>
