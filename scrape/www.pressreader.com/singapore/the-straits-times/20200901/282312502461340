    <p>Age-re­lated mac­u­lar de­gen­er­a­tion (AMD) is the lead­ing cause of vi­sion loss among se­niors world­wide (Timely eye in­jec­tions help pre­serve vi­sion, Aug 1).</p>
    <p>One of the experts in the ar­ti­cle said that on av­er­age, a pa­tient will need eight to 12 treat­ments in the first year of the disease in or­der to achieve the best out­come.</p>
    <p>I was re­ferred to the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Eye Cen­tre (SNEC) Retina Cen­tre on July 30. Af­ter some ex­am­i­na­tion, it was con­firmed that there was leak­age in my eye.</p>
    <p>The doc­tor rec­om­mended an in­jec­tion im­me­di­ately. The cost of each jab is $1,250, and more jabs would be re­quired to be ad­min­is­tered over – at min­i­mum – three con­sec­u­tive months.</p>
    <p>The to­tal bill for that one visit was $1,721.50 (in­clud­ing con­sul­ta­tion and tests), but only $650 was de­ductible from Medis­ave.</p>
    <p>The bal­ance of $1,071.50 was paid by cash.</p>
    <p>I am 64 years old and have $60,000 in my Medis­ave ac­count, yet I am al­lowed to utilise only a small amount for each visit. It is a strain on old folk to shell out cash for ev­ery visit.</p>
    <p>I ap­peal to the Govern­ment to amend the rule for those above 55 years old, and with Medis­ave bal­ance of more than $50,000, to be al­lowed to use his ac­count capped at $2,000 per visit.</p>
    <p>Given our age­ing pop­u­la­tion, cases of AMD could surely in­crease and many se­nior cit­i­zens will face the same predica­ment.</p>
    <p>I hope the Govern­ment will look into this.</p>
