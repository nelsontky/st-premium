    <p>Lo­cal shares headed south again yes­ter­day – the fourth day in a row.</p>
    <p>The trig­ger came after lo­cal in­vestors took their cue from falls in world eq­ui­ties after United States Fed­eral Re­serve of­fi­cials ex­pressed cau­tion over the coun­try’s eco­nomic out­look.</p>
    <p>It left the bench­mark Straits Times In­dex (STI) with only one way to go – down with a loss of 33.12 points, or 1.29 per cent, to 2,527.92.</p>
    <p>Losers out­paced gain­ers 298 to 161, with 1.71 bil­lion shares worth $2.29 bil­lion chang­ing hands.</p>
    <p>Min­utes from a July meet­ing of the US Fed­eral Open Mar­ket Com­mit­tee mem­bers said that the “on­go­ing pub­lic health cri­sis would weigh heav­ily on eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity, em­ploy­ment and in­fla­tion in the near term and was pos­ing con­sid­er­able risks to the eco­nomic out­look over the medium term”.</p>
    <p>The best per­former for the day among the STI con­stituents was ground han­dler and caterer Sats, which added 1.04 per cent at $2.91.</p>
    <p>But Wil­mar In­ter­na­tional plunged 10.3 per cent to $4.36, after one of its largest share­hold­ers, Archer Daniels Mid­land, an­nounced plans to sell off shares and bonds worth US$800 mil­lion (S$1.1 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>Kep­pel Corp, Jar­dine Mathe­son</p>
    <p>Hold­ings (JMH) and Hongkong Land found them­selves at the bot­tom of the STI’s per­for­mance ta­ble.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel slid 2.95 per cent to $4.61, while JMH closed down 2.63 per cent at US$39.65 and de­vel­oper Hongkong Land de­clined 2.6 per cent to US$3.75.</p>
    <p>On Aug 18, Moody’s In­vestors Ser­vice said it had com­pleted a pe­ri­odic re­view of Hongkong Land, and said that the com­pany’s A2 rat­ings were con­strained by its “geo­graphic con­cen­tra­tion in Hong Kong and the rel­a­tively high risk for its res­i­den­tial de­vel­op­ment busi­ness”.</p>
    <p>The de­clines here were re­flected across Asian mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s Hang Seng In­dex fell 1.54 per cent, in line with the global sell-off. China’s bench­mark Shang­hai Com­pos­ite In­dex sank 1.3 per cent and Ja­pan’s Nikkei 225 In­dex eased 1 per cent.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s Kospi saw an even sharper de­cline of 3.66 per cent.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian shares were down by as much as 1.1 per cent at one point but ended 0.8 per cent in the red al­though con­sumer stocks soared on the back of ro­bust re­sults achieved dur­ing the lock­down.</p>
    <p>Asian eq­ui­ties showed weak­nesses as in­vestors were dis­ap­pointed at the Fed’s min­utes, which failed to meet the mar­ket ex­pec­ta­tions of liq­uid­ity sup­ply, an­a­lyst Lee Young-gon of Hana Fi­nan­cial In­vest­ment told Reuters.</p>
