    <p>The State Courts have apol­o­gised to a lorry driver af­ter he spent an ex­tra two days in jail be­cause his pay­ment for a fine was not recorded.</p>
    <p>Mr Teo Seng Tiong, 59, was sen­tenced on Jan 14 to seven weeks’ jail and a fine of $500 for swerv­ing his lorry into a cy­clist and fail­ing to make a po­lice re­port within 24 hours of the ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>The State Courts said yes­ter­day that Mr Teo’s ap­peal was dis­missed by the High Court in July, and he paid the fine and be­gan serv­ing his jail term on July 20.</p>
    <p>While the High Court had no­ti­fied the State Courts that the fine had been paid, the State Courts of­fi­cer in charge failed to up­date the War­rant of Com­mit­ment and the case man­age­ment sys­tem ac­cord­ingly.</p>
    <p>When the Sin­ga­pore Prison Ser­vice (SPS) checked with the State Courts on Aug 21 and Aug 22, it was in­formed that the fine had not been paid ow­ing to the ear­lier er­ror.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, Mr Teo ended up stay­ing longer in jail. Dur­ing sen­tenc­ing, he was told that he would have to serve an­other three days be­hind bars if he was un­able to pay the fine.</p>
    <p>The er­ror was dis­cov­ered when Mr Teo’s lawyer, Mr Tan Hee Joek, sent a re­ceipt of the pay­ment for the fine to SPS. Mr Teo was re­leased on the morn­ing of Aug 24.</p>
    <p>“The State Courts deeply re­gret what has hap­pened, and we have con­veyed our let­ter of apol­ogy to Mr Teo through the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers,” the State Courts said in its state­ment.</p>
    <p>It has since im­ple­mented fur­ther safe­guards, such as ad­di­tional lev­els of checks. It has also com­menced an in­ter­nal re­view of the mat­ter, which could lead to “ap­pro­pri­ate ac­tion” in­clud­ing dis­ci­plinary ac­tion be­ing taken, it said.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said his client is grate­ful to the courts for quickly clar­i­fy­ing the er­ror. “He trusts that the au­thor­i­ties will soon com­mence di­a­logue with us on how Mr Teo can be ap­pro­pri­ately com­pen­sated in or­der to draw a timely clo­sure to this un­for­tu­nate episode,” the lawyer added.</p>
    <p>Lawyers The Straits Times spoke to noted the rar­ity of such er­rors.</p>
    <p>No­tably, in 2007, a man con­victed of abet­ting a loan shark to ha­rass a debtor was caned three times more than he was sen­tenced to af­ter a court clerk recorded the sen­tence wrongly. A com­pen­sa­tion was made af­ter the man reached a set­tle­ment with the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Crim­i­nal lawyer Su­nil Sud­heesan said such er­rors are “very rare”. “(Mr Teo) could have told pris­ons he paid the fine, and it was un­for­tu­nate that fur­ther checks were not car­ried out,” he said.</p>
    <p>Vet­eran lawyer Amo­lat Singh agreed that these are “very ex­cep­tional in­stances”. “The fact is that he lost his liberties for two days... I’m sure the de­fence coun­sel will work out some com­pen­sa­tion. It’s hard to quan­tify be­cause it is a pri­vate mat­ter between Mr Teo and AGC.”</p>
    <p>Lawyer Jose­phus Tan said: “As the say­ing goes, ‘one day in jail is one day too many’. Pre­vi­ous cases had set­tled with undis­closed sums of com­pen­sa­tion and I be­lieve the present case would be no dif­fer­ent.”</p>
    <p>The courts’ apol­ogy should not be read neg­a­tively, noted lawyer Shashi Nathan. “It shows that the court is trans­par­ent and in­de­pen­dent in how it looks at cases and takes these er­rors seriously.”</p>
    <p>Mr Teo was con­victed of caus­ing hurt to cy­clist Eric Che­ung Hoyu in December 2018. This was af­ter Mr Che­ung hit the left side mir­ror of Mr Teo’s lorry, break­ing it. Mr Che­ung was fined $2,800 on April 12 last year for mis­chief and caus­ing ob­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent was caught on video that was shared widely on so­cial media. Aside from the jail term, Mr Teo was also dis­qual­i­fied from hold­ing or ob­tain­ing all classes of driv­ing li­cences for two years.</p>
