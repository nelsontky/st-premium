    <p>Hur­ri­cane Sally yes­ter­day moved north-east, where it was ex­pected to bring more than 30cm of rain to some ar­eas a day af­ter it flooded streets and knocked out power to hun­dreds of thou­sands of homes on the US Gulf Coast.</p>
    <p>Sally made land­fall early on Wed­nes­day near Gulf Shores, Alabama, as a Cat­e­gory 2 storm on the five-step Saf­fir-Simp­son scale of in­ten­sity.</p>
    <p>As of late Wed­nes­day, it was mov­ing north at 15kmh af­ter be­ing down­graded to a trop­i­cal de­pres­sion, the United States Na­tional Hur­ri­cane Cen­tre said, with max­i­mum winds of 55kmh.</p>
    <p>The storm is be­lieved to have killed one per­son in Alabama.</p>
    <p>Some parts of the coast were in­un­dated with more than 60cm of rain, as the storm flooded com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>The coastal com­mu­nity of Pen­sacola, Florida, ex­pe­ri­enced up to 1.5m of flood­ing and travel was cut by dam­aged roads and bridges.</p>
    <p>More than 570,000 homes and busi­nesses across the area were with­out power.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral res­i­dents along the Alabama and Florida coasts said that dam­age f rom t he slow-mov­ing storm caught them off guard.</p>
    <p>“It was j ust con­stant rain and wind,” said Ms Pre­ity Pa­tel, 41, a res­i­dent of Pen­sacola for two years.</p>
    <p>“The wa­ter drained pretty quickly, thank­fully. It’s just clean-up now.”</p>
    <p>A sec­tion of the Pen­sacola Bay Bridge, known also as the Three­Mile Bridge, was missing a “sig­nif­i­cant sec­tion”, Florida Governor Ron DeSan­tis said.</p>
    <p>On land­fall in Gulf Shores Sally’s winds were clocked at 169kmh. Along the coast, piers were ripped away by the storm surge and winds.</p>
    <p>“This year, we’ve just got hur­ri­cane af­ter hur­ri­cane,” said Mr Matt Lane, 23, a mem­ber of an elec­tri­cal crew from New Hamp­shire Elec­tric Co-op, who ar­rived in Pen­sacola late on Tues­day di­rectly from Hur­ri­cane Laura re­cov­ery ef­forts in Texas.</p>
    <p>Sally was the 18th named storm in the At­lantic this year and the eighth of trop­i­cal storm or hur­ri­cane strength to hit the US.</p>
    <p>There are cur­rently three other named storms in the At­lantic, mak­ing it one of the most ac­tive At­lantic hur­ri­cane sea­sons on record.</p>
    <p>As hur­ri­canes go, Sally was not es­pe­cially pow­er­ful. But cli­mate change likely made it more dan­ger­ous by slow­ing it down and feed­ing it more mois­ture, set­ting it up to pum­mel the re­gion with wind and cat­a­strophic rainfall.</p>
    <p>“When a storm moves slower, it lingers longer over the same lo­ca­tion,” said As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Kim­berly Wood, a geo­sci­en­tist at Mis­sis­sippi State Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“A rain rate of, say, 2.5cm an hour – that’s not so bad if the rain only lasts 30 min­utes. But if it lasts for half a day, that adds up quickly.”</p>
    <p>And there is in­creas­ing ev­i­dence that storms are slow­ing down, Prof Wood said.</p>
    <p>That ev­i­dence comes in part from a 2018 study that showed hur­ri­canes near the Gulf and At­lantic coasts were in­creas­ingly likely to stall.</p>
    <p>The study also found a clear sig­nal of more lo­cal rainfall, said Dr James Kossin, a re­searcher with the Na­tional Oceanic and At­mo­spheric Ad­min­is­tra­tion (NOAA), who is one of the au­thors.</p>
    <p>Prof Wood said that cli­mate change has led to wet­ter storms be­cause warmer air holds more mois­ture.</p>
    <p>Be­tween the slow­ing speeds and in­creas­ing mois­ture, with storms like Sally, “there’s a com­bi­na­tion ef­fect”, she said.</p>
    <p>Dr Sarah Kap­nick, a re­searcher at NOAA’s Geo­phys­i­cal Fluid Dy­nam­ics Lab­o­ra­tory in Prince­ton, New Jer­sey, said: “There’s a ba­sic the­o­ret­i­cal un­der­stand­ing un­der­ly­ing all of this.</p>
    <p>“(With warm­ing,) you get more wa­ter vapour in the sky. So when you get these storms... they have the po­ten­tial to hold more wa­ter in them.”</p>
    <p>She added: “And that wa­ter has to go some­where.”</p>
