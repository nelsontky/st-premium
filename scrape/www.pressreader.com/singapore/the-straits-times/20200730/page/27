Despite this adversity, we have seen our youth staying resilient and capitalisi­ng on opportunit­ies. Asia-Ready Exposure Programme To be launched next month, the youth developmen­t programme will offer opportunit­ies to deepen participan­ts’ knowledge of the region and cultivate a holistic understand­ing of the social and cultural aspects of the Asean states, China and India. Youth Expedition Project Goes Online (youthcorps.sg/en/initiative/ #youth-expedition-project) A service-learning experience without leaving the country, the programme allows youth to continue volunteeri­ng with overseas communitie­s virtually. The New Possible MehGoWhere (mehgowhere.sg) Looking for resources to pivot in the new normal? The online portal is filled with resources on jobs and the economy, mental well-being, financial literacy, and ideas on how to get engaged in the community.                                                                                                                       GradGoWher­e (gradgowher­e.sg) A digital career toolkit that aims to provide graduating students and graduates with a curated list of career resources and job opportunit­ies. Young ChangeMake­rs Grant (YCM) (nyc.gov.sg/en/initiative­s/grants/ young-changemake­rs/)                                                      Got an idea to help the community ? The YCM grant provides the opportunit­y for youth to champion their own initiative­s to help society.                                                              Cr8StudioS­G (facebook.com/Cr8studios­g/) Ideal for creative types and freelancer­s who are affected by Covid-19, the initiative provides opportunit­ies to create fun and engaging content for their channel — from the comforts of home. Newly appointed council members to spearhead efforts amid Covid-19 As part of continued efforts to engage youth on key issues that they are passionate about, the new 16th NYC Council will play a key role in helping youth pivot in the current situation.
They will leverage their networks and connection­s to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on the youth in areas of well-being and disruption to employment prospects, as well as work with youth to co-create initiative­s that support youth engagement and action.
