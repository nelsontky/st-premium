    <p>A pi­lot pro­gramme re­quir­ing peo­ple to use ei­ther the free TraceTo­gether to­kens or mo­bile app to check in at cer­tain venues will be rolled out next month.</p>
    <p>For a start, those at­tend­ing larger-scale busi­ness-to-busi­ness events, such as meet­ings and con­fer­ences, will have to use ei­ther the TraceTo­gether to­kens or app to log in to the na­tional dig­i­tal check-in sys­tem SafeEn­try.</p>
    <p>This ini­tia­tive will be ex­panded over time, af­ter more to­kens have been dis­trib­uted to the pub­lic, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter-in-Charge of the Smart Na­tion Ini­tia­tive Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan said the move sup­ple­ments SafeEn­try check-in data with TraceTo­gether prox­im­ity data, which im­proves the con­tact trac­ing process.</p>
    <p>“We’re try­ing to use these dig­i­tal tools so that we can do (con­tact trac­ing) with­out in­con­ve­nience, with­out be­ing in­tru­sive and to make it seam­less and to al­low our ac­tiv­i­ties to re­sume,” he added.</p>
    <p>MOH said the ini­tia­tive will help mit­i­gate the risk of large virus clus­ters form­ing, and could al­low for a safer in­crease in ca­pac­ity lim­its at events and premises, with any po­ten­tial fu­ture eas­ing of mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s an­nounce­ment fol­lows an ear­lier move by the Gov­ern­ment to in­crease the num­ber of par­tic­i­pants al­lowed at ex­hi­bi­tions and con­fer­ences to 250.</p>
    <p>The Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment Group will work with MOH to en­sure that these to­kens are avail­able on site for peo­ple with­out the app.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties had tri­alled this at an event at the end of last month which was at­tended phys­i­cally by Sin­ga­pore-based at­ten­dees and vir­tu­ally by in­ter­na­tional at­ten­dees.</p>
    <p>Over time, the scheme will be ex­panded to other venues where there may be close in­ter­ac­tion be­tween peo­ple, where masks may not be worn at all times due to the type of ac­tiv­i­ties, and where there is high hu­man traf­fic that is harder to mon­i­tor.</p>
    <p>These venues would in­clude ho­tels, food and bev­er­age out­lets, cin­e­mas, gyms and cer­tain work­places – places with the po­ten­tial to spark off large Covid-19 out­breaks from a sin­gle pos­i­tive case.</p>
    <p>TraceTo­gether can fa­cil­i­tate rapid and com­pre­hen­sive con­tact trac­ing to stem the spread of the virus, the au­thor­i­ties noted.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme, which works via the ex­change of short-dis­tance Blue­tooth signals be­tween to­kens or mo­bile phones with the app in­stalled, has en­abled con­tact trac­ing teams to re­duce the time taken to iden­tify and quar­an­tine a close con­tact from four days to less than two days, they added.</p>
    <p>Said Dr Balakr­ish­nan: “I can’t stress enough how im­por­tant speed is in this process... the prob­a­bil­ity or the num­ber of peo­ple who would be in­fected is di­rectly re­lated to how quickly we can iden­tify and iso­late the per­son.”</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment is also work­ing with pri­vate-sec­tor firms that are in­ter­ested in sup­ply­ing con­tact trac­ing to­kens to com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>This is to en­sure these pri­vately de­vel­oped to­kens and the na­tional TraceTo­gether to­ken can de­tect one an­other and “con­trib­ute to a uni­fied con­tact trac­ing ecosys­tem”.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing re­porters dur­ing a press con­fer­ence by the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling Covid-19, Dr Balakr­ish­nan noted that the TraceTo­gether app has been down­loaded 2.4 mil­lion times.</p>
    <p>This ac­counts for about 40 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion, but is still in­suf­fi­cient, he said. “Not ev­ery­one’s app is on all the time. And therein lies the nub of the chal­lenge, be­cause the more peo­ple are ac­tively on TraceTo­gether, ex­po­nen­tially the pro­tec­tive ef­fect in­creases.”</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment is there­fore giv­ing out TraceTo­gether to­kens na­tion­wide to make things more con­ve­nient and ac­ces­si­ble for peo­ple who may not have smart­phones or pre­fer not to use the app.</p>
    <p>The dis­tri­bu­tion will start from next Mon­day at 20 com­mu­nity cen­tres in Jalan Be­sar and Tan­jong Pa­gar. Res­i­dents can visit the To­kenGoWhere web­site or re­fer to com­mu­nity no­tice boards and dig­i­tal dis­play pan­els for more in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Balakr­ish­nan also stressed that pri­vacy will not be com­pro­mised. “I need to em­pha­sise that putting to­gether these two func­tion­al­i­ties, which is venue and prox­im­ity, will still pro­tect the pri­vacy of the per­son, but it will en­hance the level of pro­tec­tion of the peo­ple con­cerned,” he added.</p>
