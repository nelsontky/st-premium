    <p>Ask any stu­dent in Sin­ga­pore what school life has been like these past few months and they ’ll likely men­tion video classes, com­puter-aided lessons and other vir­tual tools and plat­forms.</p>
    <p>On­line learn­ing is here to stay, even as stu­dents of all lev­els re­turned to brick-and-mor­tar class­rooms and learn­ing cen­tres af­ter months of home-based learn­ing ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>The shift to blended learn­ing — a mix of e-learn­ing and face-to-face teach­ing — among schools and en­rich­ment cen­tres has opened por­tals to growth op­por­tu­ni­ties for home­grown en­rich­ment provider I Can Read (ICR).</p>
    <p>Set up in 2000, the firm pro­vides English lan­guage train­ing for teach­ers and lit­er­acy cour­ses for pupils from 2.5 to 12 years old. It be­gan de­vel­op­ing on­line re­sources and plat­forms for teach­ers and stu­dents in 2018 and now op­er­ates in 13 markets across Asia and the Mid­dle East.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been work­ing on ways to de­liver our train­ing pro­grammes and cur­ricu­lum on­line for some time, but getting schools and par­ents to ac­cept e-learn­ing, espe­cially for young kids, was dif­fi­cult,” said ICR chief ex­ec­u­tive Chan Huang Yee.</p>
    <p>“The Covid-19 cri­sis has changed that,” added the 47-year-old.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to go on­line fol­lows the com­pany ’s move to li­cense its cur­ricu­lum to other schools in 2018.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, it only trained teach­ers and taught stu­dents at its 24 phys­i­cal cen­tres in Sin­ga­pore. Since li­cens­ing its cur­ricu­lum, ICR has built a net­work of more than 160 cen­tres and part­ner schools.</p>
    <p>“With the ex­pan­sion into li­cens­ing, we were look­ing at how to train teach­ers in huge num­bers — in­clud­ing those not in Sin­ga­pore. That’s how we came up with ICR Univer­sity (ICRU), our on­line train­ing pro­gramme for teach­ers,” said ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Tan Aik Ping, 48.</p>
    <p>Launched last Oc­to­ber, the pro­gramme pro­vides English teach­ers with on­line lessons, quizzes to test their mas­tery of mod­ules and train­ing to de­velop les­son plans based on the ICR cur­ricu­lum.</p>
    <p>Af­ter com­plet­ing the classes, they at­tend video meet­ings with ICR train­ers on Zoom, Google Meet and other third-party plat­forms to prac­tise their lessons, demon­strate how they would in­ter­act with stu­dents and re­ceive feed­back.</p>
    <p>The ICRU pro­gramme has trained 150 teach­ers to date.</p>
    <p>When the spread of Covid-19 forced na­tions to close schools and im­ple­ment vir­tual classes, ICR saw an­other busi­ness open­ing.</p>
    <p>It be­gan digi­tis­ing phys­i­cal teach­ing re­sources, such as flash­cards, work­books, ac­tiv­i­ties and games, for teach­ers to cre­ate in­ter­ac­tive on­line lessons on teach­ing plat­forms, like ClassIn.</p>
    <p>“Hong Kong, China and Viet­nam were the first markets that we op­er­ated in that shut their schools at the end of Fe­bru­ary,” said Ms Chan.</p>
    <p>“We im­me­di­ately started to think about how we could digi­tise our off­line games and ac­tiv­i­ties, re­design our learn­ing path­ways and change our train­ing pro­cesses.”</p>
    <p>That early pivot stood the firm in good stead when other na­tions, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, sub­se­quently closed schools.</p>
    <p>ICR On­line, an on­line sub­scrip­tion ser­vice with a va­ri­ety of on­line English lessons for pri­mary school stu­dents, made its de­but in April. It has been of­fered to more than 1,100 stu­dents in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The com­pany plans to launch this sub­scrip­tion ser­vice to stu­dents in the 12 other markets it op­er­ates in too.</p>
    <p>A full ver­sion of its ICR Champs mo­bile app, which of­fers gam­i­fied English lessons, will launch next Jan­uary. It is cur­rently test­ing a lim­ited ver­sion of the app in China.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to cre­ate an e-learn­ing tool that is a lot more en­gag­ing for stu­dents. When we looked at what was on the mar­ket, we found that most gam­i­fied apps had weak ped­a­gogy, and most e-learn­ing apps were quite bor­ing, so we de­cided to make our own,” Mr Tan ex­plained.</p>
    <p>We’ ve been work­ing on ways to de­liver our train­ing and cur­ricu­lum on­line for some time, but getting schools and par­ents to ac­cept e-learn­ing, espe­cially for young kids, was dif­fi­cult. The Covid-19 cri­sis has changed that.</p>
    <p>In the early days of start­ing the busi­ness, ICR needed to set up a phys­i­cal cen­tre or fly their in­struc­tors to over­seas part­ner schools to train teach­ers.</p>
    <p>With its in­vest­ment in dig­i­tal tools and plat­forms, the busi­ness is now able to op­er­ate on­line fully in Oman and Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) sup­ported the com­pany’s over­seas mar­ket ex­pan­sion plans through the En­ter­prise Devel­op­ment Grant, which went into de­vel­op­ing its fran­chise pro­gramme and up­grad­ing man­age­ment pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>ESG also helped the com­pany to drive busi­ness ef­fi­ciency and pro­duc­tiv­ity with an on­line plat­form that en­ables its head­quar­ters in Sin­ga­pore to mon­i­tor the per­for­mance of cen­tres in other markets in real time.</p>
    <p>ICR hopes to bring its re­mote e-learn­ing ap­proach to other coun­tries like In­dia next.</p>
    <p>“The Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion has made many coun­tries much more re­cep­tive to e-learn­ing,” said Ms Chan.</p>
    <p>“In the last few months, schools in coun­tries as far as Brazil have con­tacted us to set up on­line classes for stu­dents. There are huge markets that are now open to us be­cause distance is no longer an is­sue with our ICRU and ICR On­line plat­forms.”</p>
    <p>The firm’s on­line of­fer­ings now make up 7 per cent of its rev­enue. It hopes to grow this to 30 per cent in the next three years.</p>
