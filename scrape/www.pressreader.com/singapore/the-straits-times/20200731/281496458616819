    <p>Peo­ple take pocket con­struc­tion for granted, quips 27-year-old Es­ther Choy. Es­pe­cially men.</p>
    <p>“It’s such a shame that men get to ex­pe­ri­ence all these nice func­tions they don’t even think about, but women are com­plain­ing about how pock­ets aren’t big enough or clothes don’t fit as they should,” the de­signer and prod­uct de­vel­oper at BHG tells The Straits Times in a tele­con­fer­ence call. “It’s not like our mo­bile phones are smaller.”</p>
    <p>Ms Choy is the de­signer be­hind BHG’s first three in-house fash­ion brands, which are l aunch­ing i n phases from to­day, be­gin­ning with the Bugis Junc­tion out­let.</p>
    <p>The brands are So­ci­ete ($39.90 to $129.90), a work­wear brand for the more ma­ture of­fice wo­man; Otona Mode ($39.90 to $79.90), a Ja­panese-in­spired line of over­sized fits and nat­u­ral fab­rics; and SBT ($29.90 to $69.90), a colour­ful col­lec­tion of prints tar­geted at the younger crowd seek­ing the “week­end Sin­ga­pore aes­thetic”.</p>
    <p>The first two lines are de­signed for BHG’s cur­rent de­mo­graphic of shop­pers – who pre­fer more for­giv­ing sil­hou­ettes – while SBT, made from dead­stock fab­rics, hopes to cap­ture “the cus­tomers we want to have”, ex­plains the de­signer.</p>
    <p>And yes, ex­pect to find pock­ets in most of her dresses.</p>
    <p>Ms Choy, who grad­u­ated from Lasalle Col­lege of the Arts with a de­gree in Fash­ion De­sign and Tex­tiles (ma­jor­ing in wom­enswear) in 2016, was head­hunted last Au­gust and joined the com­pany in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>She over­sees de­signs from the draw­ing board to when they hit the five BHG stores.</p>
    <p>Head of mer­chan­dis­ing Vivien Lim, 50, says hir­ing an in-house de­signer – a first in the com­pany’s 26-year his­tory – was part of BHG’s rein­ven­tion strat­egy planned since the mid­dle of last year.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to at­tract a new crowd of younger shop­pers who may be price-sen­si­tive but are also look­ing out for qual­ity,” she says.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to be more re­lat­able to a new gen­er­a­tion of cus­tomers and we recog­nise their ap­pre­ci­a­tion for au­then­tic­ity and gen­uine in­ten­tions. It is only apt that we ap­proach this by lis­ten­ing to them, with a de­signer who i ntu­itively knows what this new gen­er­a­tion wants and needs.”</p>
    <p>Young de­sign­ers, she says, “bring new ideas and en­ergy”.</p>
    <p>Of the 12 can­di­dates in­ter­viewed, Ms Choy was se­lected for her pos­i­tive at­ti­tude and en­ergy, open­ness to com­mer­cial in­puts and will­ing­ness to learn and ex­change point­ers, Ms Lim adds.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing al­ways been in­ter­ested in art and de­sign, the de­signer’s first brush with fash­ion was when she was gifted a yarn set with chil­dren’s knit­ting nee­dles at seven years old.</p>
    <p>She asked her grand­mother to teach her to knit, cre­at­ing squares of cloth and, later, a scarf.</p>
    <p>Knit­ting would even­tu­ally find its way into her grad­u­at­ing col­lec­tion at Lasalle, which fea­tured menswear-in­spired wom­enswear.</p>
    <p>Her par­ents took some con­vinc­ing to agree to fash­ion school. Their com­pro­mise was that she com­pleted ju­nior col­lege first.</p>
    <p>At Seran­goon Ju­nior Col­lege, Ms Choy took H2 Art as one of her sub­jects, which ce­mented her de­ci­sion to pur­sue fash­ion as a ca­reer.</p>
    <p>“I wanted to do art, but art in a gallery can be en­joyed only by those who go to the gallery. I thought: ‘How can I make it more re­lat­able to peo­ple? Clothes’,” says the el­dest of four to a home­maker mother and en­gi­neer fa­ther.</p>
    <p>“It took a while for my par­ents to come around. But once they did, I had their full sup­port.”</p>
    <p>At Lasalle, she in­terned with lo­cal and in­ter­na­tional de­sign­ers. In her sec­ond year, an in­tern­ship in Lon­don with Bri­tish de­signer Ada Zan­di­ton proved a turn­ing point.</p>
    <p>She was asked to help out with the menswear line, which helped her dis­cover what kind of a de­signer she wanted to be, she says.</p>
    <p>“I think it in­formed my de­sign aes­thetic. A lot of ap­pre­ci­a­tion for menswear de­tail­ing or func­tions is lost in wom­enswear, like ad­justable waist­bands or pock­ets.</p>
    <p>“These in­flu­enced my grad­u­at­ing col­lec­tion heav­ily. I took menswear el­e­ments and made them us­able in wom­enswear de­signs.”</p>
    <p>Her time in Lon­don also gave her per­spec­tive on the lo­cal scene. “One of my main wor­ries was that Sin­ga­pore is so small, and what we learn here might not be the stan­dard across the world,” says Ms Choy, who later in­terned with lo­cal fash­ion la­bel Ong Shun­mugam.</p>
    <p>“The ex­po­sure made me re­alise that what we’re learn­ing in Lasalle is in­dus­try-stan­dard – if you pay at­ten­tion in school and prac­tise what your teach­ers teach, it works.”</p>
    <p>PAVING THE WAY FOR THE FU­TURE</p>
    <p>One chal­lenge she faced head­ing de­sign at BHG was ton­ing down the run­way-ap­pro­pri­ate looks she was taught for the com­mer­cial shop­per.</p>
    <p>“For the run­way you need to make a vis­ual im­pact im­me­di­ately, so ev­ery­thing is a bit more blownup. Run­way shows were made for pho­tos – but you don’t see peo­ple wear­ing these clothes in every­day life,” says Ms Choy, who will also de­sign the up­com­ing in-house menswear and ath­leisure brands.</p>
    <p>“When do­ing an ac­tual job, you need to keep in mind the cus­tomer you’re dress­ing and what they want.”</p>
    <p>After grad­u­at­ing but be­fore join­ing BHG, Ms Choy pi­loted her own la­bel, Esh by Es­ther, which is now on hia­tus. By in­vi­ta­tion, she show­cased the la­bel at fash­ion weeks in Sin­ga­pore, Viet­nam, Laos and Bu­san in South Korea.</p>
    <p>She re­calls early feed­back from women who said they loved her de­signs but “could never” wear them. “That was a les­son (for me) – peo­ple like the gar­ment, but will they want it in their wardrobe? It’s not to say we lose all the de­sign el­e­ments in the gar­ment, but it’s about mak­ing it com­mer­cial enough so they’re not in­tim­i­dated to wear it.”</p>
    <p>“And I don’t think I sac­ri­ficed my style. I still man­aged to slide in all my pock­ets and small func­tional de­tails,” she adds with a grin.</p>
    <p>Just shy of a year at BHG, she has learnt a lot from the depart­ment store’s “years of op­er­a­tional knowl­edge” and picked up in­dus­try know-how, from work­ing out pro­duc­tion costs to li­ais­ing with fac­to­ries and sourc­ing fab­rics.</p>
    <p>When asked if she ever saw her­self de­sign­ing for a depart­ment store, she says: “It’s not some­thing (my peers and I) con­sid­ered a job – just be­cause the job wasn’t there for us to con­sider.</p>
    <p>“But now that it is, it’s a great op­por­tu­nity for the in­dus­try and fu­ture de­sign­ers. BHG has lit­er­ally cre­ated a pool of jobs for fu­ture lo­cal play­ers where pre­vi­ously there was none.”</p>
    <p>Most of her class­mates went on to jobs in de­sign­ing or op­er­a­tions in the fash­ion in­dus­try, though none to her knowl­edge are at depart­ment stores like her­self.</p>
    <p>She sees her­self as paving the way for more lo­cal de­sign­ers to take on full-time roles in depart­ment stores.</p>
    <p>UP­SIDE AND RISKS</p>
    <p>It is cur­rently a mixed bag in the lo­cal re­tail scene. Play­ers such as Metro and OG have in-house fash­ion brands – the for­mer car­ries pri­vate la­bels like M.Mai­son and Kurt Woods – while oth­ers like Tangs and Robin­sons pre­fer stock­ing lo­cal de­sign­ers to in­tro­duc­ing in-house brands. Tangs, for in­stance, car­ries brands such as Gin­lee Stu­dio, Week­end Sun­dries and Elo­him by Sab­rina Goh.</p>
    <p>There are pros and cons to ei­ther strat­egy. Pro­fes­sor Kapil R. Tuli of Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity’s Re­tail Cen­tre of Ex­cel­lence says: “Hav­ing in-house brands is a sim­ple busi­ness de­ci­sion based on your risk pref­er­ence.”</p>
    <p>Costs can add up, he says. “You have to cre­ate an in-house de­sign team, find your own sources and keep in­vest­ing in de­signs. It can be ex­pen­sive – eas­ily up to a few mil­lion dol­lars a year if you want to cre­ate a line-up of de­sign op­tions.”</p>
    <p>He adds: “The risk is that con­sumers’ pref­er­ences, es­pe­cially for fash­ion, change very quickly. Cu­rat­ing brands has flex­i­bil­ity, where re­tail­ers can fol­low the trends and stock a hot new brand; some would rather spend their money there.”</p>
    <p>The up­side is that “it’s your brand and you get more mar­gins from that com­par­a­tively”, as well as con­trol over pro­duc­tion, pric­ing and mar­ket­ing, he says.</p>
    <p>In Ms Choy’s opin­ion, hav­ing orig­i­nal de­signs could lead to a rein­ven­tion of the re­tail genre.</p>
    <p>Depart­ment stores have al­ways been a gath­er­ing of other brands, she ob­serves, but these brands are of­ten avail­able else­where, some­times at a bet­ter deal.</p>
    <p>“So you are never able to build depart­ment store loy­alty,” she says. “But our ex­clu­sive de­signs are only in our stores – if you like them you have to come back to us.”</p>
    <p>There have in­deed been a few re­peat cus­tomers. The three brands had a soft launch in Jan­uary, with smaller col­lec­tions hit­ting the stores. Tourists liked her body­con dresses while lo­cal women fancy her tops, says Ms Choy, who sheep­ishly ad­mits she has been lurk­ing around the shopfloor ob­serv­ing how cus­tomers re­act to her de­signs.</p>
    <p>She is op­ti­mistic about the road ahead. The pan­demic has changed buying pref­er­ences, with a lot more peo­ple look­ing to buy lo­cally these days to avoid in­ter­na­tional ship­ping, she adds.</p>
    <p>“It’s been great, hav­ing full con­trol as a de­signer at such a young age. Never would I have thought that at 27, I would have my own de­signs on the floor of a depart­ment store.”</p>
