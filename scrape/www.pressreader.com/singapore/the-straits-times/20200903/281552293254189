    <p>Bos­ton Celtics’ Kemba Walker is a happy man these days as the 30-year-old point guard is for the first time in his Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) ca­reer, play­ing for a team that has a real chance of mak­ing the Fi­nals for the first time since 2010.</p>
    <p>STAR POWER</p>
    <p>A lot of times in my ca­reer, in games like that, it prob­a­bly would have been a blowout. But for me to have these guys, who can step up and just make huge plays the way they did, man, it’s spe­cial.</p>
    <p>KEMBA WALKER, Celtics’ All-Star guard, on be­ing sur­rounded by good play­ers. Prior to these play-offs, the 30-year-old, who spent his en­tire NBA ca­reer in Char­lotte be­fore mov­ing to Bos­ton, had never been to the sec­ond round.</p>
    <p>(Florida) • Kemba Walker is a most un­usual Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) star.</p>
    <p>Even though he is a four-time Al­lS­tar, who honed his game at the Char­lotte Hor­nets un­der owner Michael Jor­dan, the guard is pretty low key for a player of his cal­i­bre.</p>
    <p>He rarely trash talks. He is not in­ter­ested in a ca­reer in film, tele­vi­sion or mu­sic. His so­cial media pres­ence is bland. He rarely makes head­lines or goes vi­ral in clips that do not in­volve his play.</p>
    <p>In a league where in­di­vid­ual play­ers al­most al­ways make their pres­ence known, Walker is con­tent be­ing in the back­ground.</p>
    <p>So why is the 30-year-old al­ways so happy?</p>
    <p>For the first time in his NBA ca­reer, he is play­ing for a team who have a real chance of mak­ing the Fi­nals for the first time since 2010.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, the Bos­ton Celtics went up 2-0 against the Toronto Rap­tors, the de­fend­ing cham­pi­ons, in their East­ern Con­fer­ence sec­ond-round play-off se­ries af­ter a 102-99 win at Dis­ney World.</p>
    <p>Walker had a ter­ri­ble shoot­ing night, go­ing 6-of-18 from the field, but he made clutch plays down the stretch to fin­ish with 17 points.</p>
    <p>In Char­lotte, he made the play­offs twice and was bounced in the first round each time. He has never had the ex­pec­ta­tion of win­ning on his shoul­ders un­til now, and he has never played with team­mates this tal­ented.</p>
    <p>One of his best friends on the Celtics team, Walker said, is Jayson Ta­tum, who led all scor­ers with 34 points against the Rap­tors.</p>
    <p>The 22-year-old for­ward has blos­somed into one of the best play­ers in the league, earn­ing his first All</p>
    <p>Star nod in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Ta­tum’s as­cen­sion also means that Walker is in an un­fa­mil­iar po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>He may not be the best player on the floor at times, but that does not bother him as he con­sid­ers it to be a bless­ing to be part of a young, ex­cit­ing team that swept their oldest ri­vals, the Philadel­phia 76ers, for the first time in the pre­vi­ous round.</p>
    <p>Asked why he cel­e­brated the win over Toronto with a fist-pump­ing vic­tory lap, Walker said: “You know what I’ve been through. Ev­ery­body knows what I’ve been through... haven’t been in the sec­ond round.</p>
    <p>“A lot of times in my ca­reer, in games like that, it prob­a­bly would have been a blowout.</p>
    <p>“But for me to have these guys, who can step up and just make huge plays the way they did, man, it’s spe­cial.</p>
    <p>“And it’s a great feel­ing to know guys got my back like that. I just re­ally ap­pre­ci­ate my team­mates.”</p>
    <p>For the Rap­tors, they are now at the cross­roads of the East­ern Con­fer­ence semi-fi­nals, hav­ing seen their eight-game win­ning run end in em­phatic fash­ion.</p>
    <p>But Toronto have been in a sim­i­lar los­ing po­si­tion be­fore. Last year, they went 2-0 down to the Mil­wau­kee Bucks in the East Fi­nals, only to reel off four suc­ces­sive vic­to­ries.</p>
    <p>The only dif­fer­ence is that back then, they had Fi­nals Most Valu­able Player Kawhi Leonard, on top of home-court ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>Still, All-Star guard Kyle Lowry, who had 16 points, feels his team can bounce back in Game 3 to­day.</p>
    <p>“We have to go back and look at the film and un­der­stand what we’ve done wrong and look at what we can do bet­ter,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We just lost two games. We have a chance to get one game. That’s all we have to do. Get one game, and take it one game at a time.</p>
    <p>“The Celtics, they are play­ing ex­tremely well. We have to find a way to get our­selves go­ing bet­ter.”</p>
