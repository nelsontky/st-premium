    <p>Use the im­age of your favourite celebrity as your desk­top wall­pa­per all you want. But use it for the wrong pur­poses and you might find your­self slapped with a law­suit. Here are some celebri­ties who have had no qualms with su­ing over the use of their im­age and like­ness.</p>
    <p>1 JAY CHOU</p>
    <p>J Hero Chi­nese Cui­sine, a restau­rant in China, has been called a trea­sure trove of mem­o­ra­bilia con­nected to Tai­wanese su­per­star Jay Chou (right).</p>
    <p>Chi­nese me­dia re­ports say many of the restau­rant’s dishes are named af­ter the singer’s songs, such as Black Hu­mour and Cow­boy On The Run. His al­bums are on dis­play, his mu­sic videos are screened and there is a standee of him at the en­trance.</p>
    <p>But Chou, 41, ap­par­ently did not give the restau­rant per­mis­sion to use his name and face. In Jan­uary last year, an at­tor­ney rep­re­sent­ing the star is­sued the restau­rant a let­ter in­form­ing it of copy­right in­fringe­ment.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the eatery made rec­ti­fi­ca­tions, Chou’s rep­re­sen­ta­tives thanked the restau­rant in April. But in De­cem­ber, his team re­port­edly sued the restau­rant, or­der­ing it to apol­o­gise to the star and pay 500,000 yuan (S$100,000) as repa­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>On Aug 19 this year, the restau­rant re­leased a state­ment on Weibo claim­ing it had the rights to use Chou’s im­age. It up­loaded a video of the singer at­tend­ing the rib­bon-cut­ting cer­e­mony of its first out­let in Bei­jing in 2015, as well as an­other video of him con­grat­u­lat­ing it on open­ing an­other out­let in Xi­a­men in 2017.</p>
    <p>The case is on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>ARI­ANA GRANDE</p>
    <p>Imi­ta­tion may be the high­est form of flat­tery, but not ev­ery­one sees it that way.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber last year, Amer­i­can singer Ari­ana Grande (right) filed a civil law­suit against fast-fash­ion re­tailer For­ever 21 for al­legedly us­ing her distinc­tive style to sell its wares with­out her per­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>She sued for US$10 mil­lion (S$14 mil­lion) and ac­cused the United States re­tailer of mis­ap­pro­pri­at­ing her name, im­age, like­ness and mu­sic, in­clud­ing us­ing a looka­like model in ad­ver­tise­ments ear­lier last year.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the com­plaint, For­ever 21 had pre­vi­ously sought a pro­mo­tional ar­range­ment with the 27-year-old singer, but she de­clined.</p>
    <p>The com­pany said in a state­ment that it was dis­put­ing the al­le­ga­tions, but was a huge sup­porter of Grande and hoped to find a mu­tu­ally agree­able res­o­lu­tion. By the end of that month, how­ever, it had filed for bank­ruptcy.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>MEL GIB­SON</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, as the pan­demic ravaged the world, a sin­gle mother in Chile thought she had found the per­fect way to bring in ex­tra cash by sell­ing some organic honey which she had stashed in her pantry.</p>
    <p>Ms Yo­hana Agurto, 40, even came up with a catchy name for the prod­uct – “Miel Gib­son” – miel is the Span­ish word for honey. She used an im­age of ac­tor Mel Gib­son from his movie Brave­heart (1995) on the jars, ac­com­pa­nied by the slo­gan “only for the brave”.</p>
    <p>Last month, she re­ceived a let­ter from Gib­son’s lawyers, say­ing her use of his name and like­ness vi­o­lated his rights. It threat­ened le­gal ac­tion if she did not with­draw the prod­uct im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>Ms Agurto told Reuters that the let­ter fright­ened her and that the pan­demic had left her with­out work.</p>
    <p>She also ap­pealed to the 64-year-old ac­tor (right) on Twit­ter to let her use his im­age.</p>
    <p>Ap­par­ently, it did not work. The brand’s social me­dia ac­counts show that it still goes by the same name, but its logo is now of a bee.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>KIM KAR­DASHIAN</p>
    <p>Just like her life, this law­suit filed by Amer­i­can so­cialite and re­al­ity TV star Kim Kar­dashian (right) was full of per­sonal drama.</p>
    <p>In 2011, three years be­fore Kar­dashian’s mar­riage to rap­per Kanye West, the 39-year-old sued US fash­ion brand Old Navy, claim­ing it had in­ten­tion­ally used a looka­like model – Canada-born singer-ac­tress Melissa Moli­naro – in an ad­ver­tis­ing cam­paign to dupe con­sumers into think­ing she was as­so­ci­ated with the la­bel.</p>
    <p>Cu­ri­ously, Moli­naro was then ru­moured to be dat­ing one of Kar­dashian’s ex-boyfriends, foot­ball star Reg­gie Bush.</p>
    <p>But, de­spite the sound and fury, the law­suit was set­tled pri­vately in 2012.</p>
    <p>5 RI­HANNA</p>
    <p>In 2013, Bar­ba­dian singer-song­writer Ri­hanna (right) won a le­gal bat­tle against Bri­tish high-street fash­ion store Top­shop over a sleeve­less top that used a recog­nis­able im­age of her.</p>
    <p>Top­shop was sell­ing the gar­ment for £22 in 2012 and the im­age was de­rived from a photo taken dur­ing a video shoot for the 32-year-old star’s al­bum, Talk That Talk (2011).</p>
    <p>The court ruled in favour of the singer and her lawyers were granted an in­junc­tion pre­vent­ing the store from us­ing her im­age in the fu­ture.</p>
