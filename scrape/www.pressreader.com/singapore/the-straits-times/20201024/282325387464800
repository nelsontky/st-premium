    <p>PALO ALTO • At Tesla’s bal­ly­hooed Bat­tery Day event in Sep­tem­ber, chief ex­ec­u­tive Elon Musk set him­self an am­bi­tious tar­get: to pro­duce a US$25,000 (S$33,900) elec­tric car in three years.</p>
    <p>Hit­ting that sticker price – about US$13,000 cheaper than the least ex­pen­sive model to­day – is seen as crit­i­cal in de­liv­er­ing a true, mass­mar­ket prod­uct.</p>
    <p>Get­ting there means find­ing new sav­ings on tech­nol­ogy, most crit­i­cally the bat­ter­ies that can make up one-third of the cost of an elec­tric ve­hi­cle (EV).</p>
    <p>Q Why are EV bat­ter­ies so ex­pen­sive?</p>
    <p>A Largely be­cause of what goes in them. An EV uses the same recharge­able lithium-ion bat­ter­ies that are in your lap­top or mo­bile phone, but they are just much big­ger to en­able them to de­liver far more en­ergy.</p>
    <p>The prici­est com­po­nent in each cell is the cath­ode, one of the two elec­trodes that store and re­lease a charge.</p>
    <p>That is be­cause the ma­te­ri­als needed in cath­odes to pack in more en­ergy are of­ten ex­pen­sive: met­als such as cobalt, nickel, lithium and man­ganese. They need to be mined, pro­cessed and con­verted into high-pu­rity chem­i­cal com­pounds.</p>
    <p>Q How much are we talk­ing about?</p>
    <p>A At cur­rent rates and pack sizes, the av­er­age bat­tery cost for a typ­i­cal elec­tric ve­hi­cle works out to about US$7,350.</p>
    <p>That has come down a lot – 87 per cent over the past decade, ac­cord­ing to BloombergN­EF.</p>
    <p>But the av­er­age pack price of US$156 per kilo­watt hour (kWh) – from about US$1,183 in 2010 – is still above the US$100 thresh­old at which the cost of an EV should match a car with an in­ter­nal com­bus­tion en­gine.</p>
    <p>Q How will the bat­ter­ies get cheaper? A Lithium ion packs are on track to drop to US$93 per kWh by 2024, ac­cord­ing to Bloomberg fore­casts.</p>
    <p>To get there, one fo­cus for man­u­fac­tur­ers is re­plac­ing high-cost cobalt with nickel. That has a dou­ble ben­e­fit: nickel is cheaper and it also holds more en­ergy, al­low­ing man­u­fac­tur­ers to re­duce the vol­ume needed.</p>
    <p>How­ever, cobalt’s ad­van­tage is that it does not over­heat or catch fire eas­ily, mean­ing man­u­fac­tur­ers need to make safety ad­just­ments when they use a sub­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>Pana­sonic in Ja­pan plans to com­mer­cialise a cobalt-free ver­sion of a high-en­ergy bat­tery in two to three years; other sup­pli­ers al­ready pro­duce lower-en­ergy ones.</p>
    <p>There is also at­ten­tion on the bat­tery packs, of­ten re­sem­bling over­sized suit­cases, that house rows of in­di­vid­ual cells. Sim­pli­fy­ing the de­sign, and us­ing a stan­dard prod­uct for a range of ve­hi­cles – rather than a pack tai­lored to each model – will de­liver ad­di­tional sav­ings.</p>
    <p>Q Who are the big­gest man­u­fac­tur­ers?</p>
    <p>A Asia dom­i­nates man­u­fac­tur­ing of lithium ion cells, ac­count­ing for more than 80 per cent of ex­ist­ing ca­pac­ity. The ma­jor­ity of that might is in China.</p>
    <p>Europe is build­ing new fac­to­ries and will sur­pass North Amer­ica in cell man­u­fac­tur­ing from next year, ac­cord­ing to Wood Macken­zie.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the Chi­nese firm Con­tem­po­rary Am­perex Tech­nol­ogy shipped the high­est vol­umes last year, in­clud­ing bat­ter­ies bound for power grids and stor­age sys­tems.</p>
    <p>It is a tighter field in the race to sup­ply au­tomak­ers, where Pana­sonic led last year. South Korea’s LG Chem has surged ahead this year, cap­tur­ing about a quar­ter of the mar­ket i n the first eight months, ac­cord­ing to SNE Re­search. Tesla and Pana­sonic’s joint ven­ture is the big­gest bat­tery pro­ducer in the US.</p>
    <p>Emerg­ing pro­duc­ers in­clude North­volt in Swe­den, founded by for­mer Tesla ex­ec­u­tives.</p>
    <p>Q Are all EV bat­ter­ies the same?</p>
    <p>A Lithium ion tech­nol­ogy has dom­i­nated the recharge­able-bat­tery sec­tor since it was com­mer­cialised by Sony in 1991. Im­prove­ments to life­span, power, weight and costs have led to the com­po­nents’ us­age leap­ing from cam­corders to SUVs, buses and fer­ries.</p>
    <p>While lithium ion cells, like all bat­ter­ies, have the same ba­sic com­po­nents: two elec­trodes – a cath­ode and an an­ode – and an elec­trolyte that helps shut­tle the charge be­tween them, there are dif­fer­ences in the ma­te­ri­als used, and that is key to how much en­ergy they hold.</p>
    <p>Grid stor­age sys­tems, or ve­hi­cles trav­el­ling short dis­tances, can use cheaper and less pow­er­ful cath­ode chem­istry that com­bines lithium, iron and phos­phate.</p>
    <p>For higher-per­for­mance ve­hi­cles, car­mak­ers favour more en­ergy-dense ma­te­ri­als, such as lithium-nickel-man­ganese-cobalt ox­ide or lithium-nickel-cobalt-alu­minium ox­ide.</p>
    <p>Q Is cost the only hur­dle?</p>
    <p>A There is still an is­sue with driv­ing range. While the most ex­pen­sive EVs can travel 640km or more be­fore a top-up, con­sumers con­sid­er­ing more main­stream mod­els re­main anx­ious about how of­ten they would need to recharge.</p>
    <p>Car­mak­ers and gov­ern­ments have be­come di­rectly in­volved in the roll-out of public recharg­ing in­fra­struc­ture, con­scious of a need to al­lay fears over not find­ing an elec­tric pump on the go.</p>
