    <p>It is heart­en­ing to know that mem­bers of the pub­lic are proac­tive in call­ing out racism (NLB moves book to adult sec­tion af­ter com­plaint it con­veys racist mes­sages, Oct 21).</p>
    <p>A li­brary user re­ported a chil­dren’s Chi­nese-lan­guage pic­ture book to the Na­tional Li­brary Board (NLB) for its racist de­pic­tion of an In­dian boy as a bully.</p>
    <p>NLB with­drew Wu Xing Hua’s book, Who Wins?, from the chil­dren’s sec­tion in the li­brary. The book’s pub­lisher, Mar­shall Cavendish Ed­u­ca­tion, also apol­o­gised to read­ers in a Face­book mes­sage and promised to cease pub­lish­ing and sell­ing it.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the de­ci­sion by the NLB to move the of­fend­ing book to the fam­ily and par­ent­ing sec­tion in its Adult Col­lec­tions is puz­zling.</p>
    <p>Racism is not like sex – in­ap­pro­pri­ate for chil­dren, but ac­cept­able for adults.</p>
    <p>NLB’s ex­pla­na­tion for its de­ci­sion is un­clear: “Par­ents and guardians can make use of this book to dis­cuss how chil­dren can deal with bul­ly­ing in schools and cor­rect any po­ten­tial mis­un­der­stand­ings that chil­dren may have.”</p>
    <p>Is an as­sump­tion be­ing made that adults are wiser than chil­dren when it comes to racism?</p>
    <p>Last year’s “brown­face” in­ci­dent showed that even peo­ple in ad­ver­tis­ing and me­dia agen­cies could not recog­nise racism.</p>
    <p>In­deed, in real life, there are many adults who hold racist view­points and act on them.</p>
    <p>We can rely on our teach­ers to con­vey cor­rect at­ti­tudes to chil­dren, but we can’t speak for the “ed­u­ca­tion” they re­ceive at home.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther, it is un­likely that a book ac­knowl­edged to be racist would have any­thing use­ful to say about bul­ly­ing since racism it­self in­volves an un­equal ex­er­tion of power over others and pro­ceeds from a sim­i­lar psy­chol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The NLB points out that its de­ci­sion was sup­ported by the Li­brary Con­sul­ta­tive Panel that is made up of a cross-sec­tion of cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the NLB should con­sider form­ing a panel with peo­ple able to con­sult on is­sues of so­cial and in­tel­lec­tual im­por­tance rather than have it rep­re­sent dif­fer­ent con­stituen­cies of cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>The NLB should elab­o­rate on its de­ci­sion to con­tinue to make a book avail­able to read­ers af­ter recog­nis­ing it as racist. Read­ers will want to be re­as­sured that NLB does not wish to play a role in per­pet­u­at­ing racism in the coun­try.</p>
