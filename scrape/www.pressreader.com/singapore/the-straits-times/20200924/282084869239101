    <p>Ms Cyn­thia Chua’s first job af­ter grad­u­at­ing from the National Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore with a de­gree in eco­nomics and statis­tics was at a bank.</p>
    <p>Her work in­volved mar­ket­ing cor­po­rate credit cards, but she soon re­alised it was not for her.</p>
    <p>“When I ex­pe­ri­enced the cor­po­rate en­vi­ron­ment – so much gos­sip and pol­i­tics – I was very quick to say it was not for me,” said Ms Chua, 48. So in 1996, she started her first busi­ness, Spa Esprit, at Hol­land Vil­lage.</p>
    <p>She now has 16 brands to her name, rang­ing from beauty chains Browhaus and Strip to food out­let Tiong Bahru Bak­ery.</p>
    <p>She is one of 17 l ocal en­trepreneur­s fea­tured in a book launched yes­ter­day that aims to in­spire young peo­ple to em­brace an en­tre­pre­neur­ial mind­set. Oth­ers fea­tured in­clude Charles Wong, founder of Charles and Keith, and Eu Yan Sang founder Richard Eu.</p>
    <p>En­trepreneur­ship Un­lim­ited is an in-house publi­ca­tion by Halo­gen Foun­da­tion (Sin­ga­pore), an In­sti­tu­tion of a Pub­lic Char­ac­ter char­ity founded in 2003.</p>
    <p>The vir­tual book launch was held yes­ter­day to raise funds for Halo­gen’s work in spon­sor­ing en­tre­pre­neur­ial pro­grammes for youth from un­der­served com­mu­ni­ties, in­clud­ing stu­dents on fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance schemes.</p>
    <p>The book costs $30 and can be pre-or­dered. Mem­bers of the pub­lic may buy it for them­selves or choose a “pay it for­ward” op­tion to do­nate it to the char­ity. It will then be given to one of the youth in Halo­gen’s pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>The foun­da­tion said an en­tre­pre­neur­ial mind­set is “an at­ti­tude and way of see­ing chal­lenge and op­por­tu­nity, es­sen­tial to nav­i­gat­ing ob­sta­cles in work and life”.</p>
    <p>Ms Chua said: “Though I’m never sure if a new busi­ness idea will work, I’m not afraid to try be­cause an idea is like a pro­to­type. You just need to keep tweak­ing it till it works.”</p>
    <p>Halo­gen Foun­da­tion fo­cuses on build­ing young lead­ers and en­trepreneur­s and aims to make qual­ity lead­er­ship and en­trepreneur­ship ed­u­ca­tion avail­able to all young peo­ple re­gard­less of back­ground, race, in­come or re­li­gion.</p>
