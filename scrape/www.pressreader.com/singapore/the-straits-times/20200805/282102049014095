    <p>I ap­pre­ci­ate the Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment Of­fice’s (SNDGO) re­ply to my let­ter (Con­certed ef­fort made to ex­pand data avail­able to public, Aug 3). In re­sponse, I of­fer four points.</p>
    <p>First, re­leas­ing more data does not mean re­leas­ing use­ful data. While there may be a plethora of data sets avail­able to the public, this data is typ­i­cally not use­ful for ro­bust anal­y­ses that will lead to pol­icy co-creation.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam in 2018 said that we should be care­ful of “sin­gle-fac­tor cor­re­la­tions”. Un­for­tu­nately, one can do lit­tle more than that us­ing data on sites like data.gov.sg</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, re-iden­ti­fi­ca­tion is a real risk, but one which can be rea­son­ably ad­dressed. For ex­am­ple, one could re­lease sur­vey data on in­di­vid­u­als us­ing age bands (51 to 60, 61 to 70 and so on) in­stead of re­leas­ing their ex­act ages. Em­ploy­ing such meth­ods would make it harder to re-iden­tify in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>The use of se­cure data labs and the like could then be put in place only if re­searchers wish to ac­cess more sen­si­tive data such as ge­o­graph­i­cal lo­ca­tion. Such prac­tices are not un­com­mon else­where. Data repos­i­to­ries all around the world man­age to se­curely store sen­si­tive data sets, while making as much of it pub­licly avail­able as pos­si­ble. It is not an all-or-noth­ing sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Third, most sur­vey data held by gov­ern­ment agen­cies is un­likely to threaten Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional in­ter­ests. For in­stance, the</p>
    <p>Na­tional Youth Sur­vey and the Mar­riage and Par­ent­hood Sur­vey are stud­ies that look at so­ci­etal trends in youth par­tic­i­pa­tion and mar­riage. They con­tain rel­a­tively harm­less mea­sures on ar­eas such as so­cial ac­tiv­ity and gen­eral well-be­ing that are of in­ter­est to many Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, the Gov­ern­ment should se­ri­ously con­sider the costs of be­ing over­pro­tec­tive of data. Re­searchers can ap­ply for var­i­ous grants to col­lect sur­vey data, but many of these stud­ies over­lap sub­stan­tially with ex­ist­ing data al­ready held by gov­ern­ment agen­cies. This is a waste of tax­pay­ers’ money, given how ex­pen­sive the data is to col­lect.</p>
    <p>A “care­ful and calibrated ap­proach” sounds good in the ab­stract, but over-pro­tec­tive­ness com­pro­mises the time­li­ness of re­search find­ings.</p>
    <p>In my per­sonal ex­pe­ri­ence, gov­ern­ment agen­cies are of­ten slow and opaque in the process of col­lab­o­rat­ing with in­de­pen­dent re­searchers.</p>
    <p>Over-pro­tec­tive­ness can lead to group­think. SNDGO refers to “com­mis­sioned re­searchers”, but if data is shared with only peo­ple who the Gov­ern­ment deems “safe”, doesn’t that de­feat the pur­pose of pol­icy co-creation with the public? Shan­non Ang (Dr)</p>
