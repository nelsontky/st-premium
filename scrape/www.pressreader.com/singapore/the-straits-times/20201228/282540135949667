    <p>Even as tor­ren­tial rain forced the Roller­sports Grand Na­tional Cham­pi­onships to a pre­ma­ture end yes­ter­day, the bad weather could not dampen the spir­its of a com­mu­nity starved of com­pet­i­tive ac­tion for a year.</p>
    <p>Muham­mad Syafiq Ta­har, win­ner of the roller freestyle/ag­gres­sive in­line open cat­e­gory, was one of those af­fected as his event on Satur­day was de­layed by a day due to in­clement weather at the Som­er­set Skate Park.</p>
    <p>But the 34-year-old did not mind.</p>
    <p>He said: “I al­ways try to par­tic­i­pate in every com­pe­ti­tion there is and this is also good for the sport.</p>
    <p>“It’s the end of the year so un­der­stand­ably, the weather isn’t so good.</p>
    <p>“The or­gan­is­ers and judges did their best, so hope­fully we’ll see more of such com­pe­ti­tions.”</p>
    <p>The se­cu­rity of­fi­cer, who has been in­line skat­ing for over 20 years, amassed 70 points to fin­ish ahead of Toby Wil­liams and Mar­cus Png, who were se­cond and third re­spec­tively on 64 points.</p>
    <p>Although seven cat­e­gories were com­pleted over the week­end, the eighth event – the freestyle scooter in­ter­na­tional open pro – was called off yes­ter­day af­ter­noon owing to wet weather.</p>
    <p>Scooter ath­lete Nadir Mah­mood was lucky as he was crowned win­ner of the open 11 to 18 years old cat­e­gory right be­fore the down­pour.</p>
    <p>The 14-year-old Tan­glin Trust School stu­dent topped the field with 65 points, ahead of Huang Bin Bin (62) and Ry­land Coun­sell (61), who were se­cond and third re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Com­pet­ing in his first cham­pi­onship, Nadir said: “It feels good be­cause I’ve never taken part in a com­pe­ti­tion be­fore.</p>
    <p>“I wasn’t try­ing to win, it was more of get­ting the ex­pe­ri­ence of com­pet­ing.”</p>
    <p>While the mon­soon sea­son is not an ideal time to host out­door events, or­gan­iser So­nia Ong felt that it was im­por­tant to stage this for freestyle scooter and ag­gres­sive in­line skat­ing as there has been a dearth of events this year owing to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The chair of the Sin­ga­pore Roller­sports Fed­er­a­tion’s Vi­sion 2030 cam­paign said: “I spon­sored this com­pe­ti­tion be­cause th­ese sports are un­der­served, un­der­funded and un­der the radar, hence it is nec­es­sary to give them a big push into the spot­light.”</p>
