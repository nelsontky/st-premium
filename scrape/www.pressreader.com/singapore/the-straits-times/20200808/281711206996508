    <p>Philip­pine of­fi­cials yes­ter­day dis­puted data that showed the coun­try had the most Covid-19 cases in East Asia, in­sist­ing that pre­vi­ous “hot spot” In­done­sia was just not test­ing enough peo­ple, a claim Jakarta con­tested.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause we test more, it is not true that we have more cases than In­done­sia. The In­done­sians just don’t know just ex­actly how many who are sick are out there. At least we do,” said Mr Harry Roque, the spokesman for Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines on Thursday re­ported a to­tal tally of 119,460 cases, the high­est in all of East Asia.</p>
    <p>Only In­dia, Pak­istan and Bangladesh have more cases in Asia.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia, which till Thursday had been the epi­cen­tre, had 118,753 cases. Yes­ter­day, it re­ported 2,473 new in­fec­tions, bring­ing the to­tal tally in the coun­try to 121,226.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines’ caseload jumped by nearly 3,300 yes­ter­day to 122,754.</p>
    <p>“There are those say­ing these are bad num­bers be­cause we are the high­est. It is not like that. It only means we know where the cases are… Quot­ing Don­ald Trump, if we want to see a lower fig­ure, we should stop test­ing. But that is not our pol­icy,” said Mr Roque.</p>
    <p>He said the Philip­pines is see­ing a spike in in­fec­tions be­cause it has been able to ramp up test­ing.</p>
    <p>He said the coun­try has al­ready con­ducted more than 1.6 mil­lion tests, or 28,938 per day.</p>
    <p>Data from In­done­sia’s Covid-19 mit­i­ga­tion task force showed that as of Thursday, the num­ber of tests had reached 1.63 mil­lion, while 930,000 peo­ple had been tested. A num­ber of them had been tested more than once.</p>
    <p>Task force spokesman Wiku Adis­as­mito told The Straits Times that In­done­sia was al­ready test­ing some 20,000 peo­ple a day and was look­ing at ramp­ing this up to 30,000, in line with the target set by Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia’s pop­u­la­tion is more than twice that of the Philip­pines, which stands at roughly 107 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Mr Roque said: “We are find­ing more cases be­cause we are test­ing three times more than In­done­sia. That is our ba­sis for say­ing it is not true or con­clu­sive that we have more cases than In­done­sia.”</p>
    <p>Echo­ing Mr Roque, Philip­pine Health Un­der­sec­re­tary Maria Rosario Vergeire told re­porters that the coun­try has con­ducted more tests than any other na­tion in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte on Sun­day placed Metropoli­tan Manila and the nearby prov­inces of Bu­la­can, Riza, Cavite and La­guna – home to some 27 mil­lion – back on lock­down for at least two weeks, as in­fec­tions soared soon af­ter he eased strict quar­an­tine curbs, that were in place since mid-March, on June 1.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines re­ported more than 75,000 cases for June and July alone. So far this month, the tally has al­ready reached close to 30,000.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers at the Univer­sity of the Philip­pines said on Tues­day that they ex­pect the tougher curbs to pre­vent at least 50,000 new cases. They said in­fec­tions would have topped 220,000 by the end of the month if the gov­ern­ment had stayed the course.</p>
    <p>“This virus is not go­ing to go away eas­ily,” said Eco­nomic Plan­ning Sec­re­tary Karl Chua. “But if we do noth­ing right now, while the health­care sys­tem is in dire need, our re­cov­ery won’t be sus­tain­able,” he said. “We have to dance with the virus.”</p>
