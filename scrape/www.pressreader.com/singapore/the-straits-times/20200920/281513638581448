    <p>JAKARTA Lo­cal con­tent is mak­ing its pres­ence felt at last on the re­gional video-on-de­mand scene.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, Net­flix picked up Girl From Nowhere, a thriller about a mys­te­ri­ous teenager who con­fronts bul­lies at a Thai high school.</p>
    <p>The show’s cre­ators, Ms Pim­mard Be Leenu­taphong and Ms Damisa Ongsiri­wat­tana, were un­der­stand­ably elated.</p>
    <p>The se­ries used to air on a lo­cal ter­res­trial net­work. But now, the pro­gramme, which seeks to paint young women as more than the de­mure love in­ter­est they tend to be in Thai­land, is reach­ing a wider au­di­ence. Picked up for a sec­ond sea­son, it is a hit in Tai­wan, Sin­ga­pore and the Philip­pines, and is sub­ti­tled into 25 lan­guages, Net­flix says.</p>
    <p>“It feels like a dream come true,” says Ms Ongsiri­wat­tana, who co-founded a fem­i­nistlean­ing ad­ver­tis­ing agency called Sour with Ms Leenu­taphong in 2017.</p>
    <p>“We’re not women in film. But we were able to share an idea and the whole world sees it. We never thought that would hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>The re­gion is see­ing a burst of new con­tent as pro­duc­tion houses keep up with or­ders from video-on-de­mand heavy­weights.</p>
    <p>Dis­ney de­buted its Dis­ney+ Hot­star in In­done­sia this month, with 7,500 movies and se­ries episodes, such as The Man­dalo­rian, in its cat­a­logue.</p>
    <p>LOCK­ING IN VIEW­ERS</p>
    <p>Now, the race is on to crank up movies and tele­vi­sion shows fea­tur­ing lo­cal tal­ent and sto­ries from home to lock in view­ers.</p>
    <p>Net­flix says it has more than 200 orig­i­nal ti­tles from South­east Asia, and will li­cense 500 more ex­ist­ing ti­tles by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>Dis­ney has inked agree­ments with more than half a dozen</p>
    <p>pro­duc­tion houses. Some of th­ese up­com­ing movies will stream di­rectly to the ser­vice, by­pass­ing cin­e­mas that are, any­way, shut be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The key is to tap into the big­pop­u­la­tion coun­tries,” says Mr Vivek Couto, co-founder of con­sul­tancy Me­dia Part­ners Asia. “What’s miss­ing is con­tent.”</p>
    <p>When Warner Broth­ers and In­done­sia’s Go­jek ap­proached</p>
    <p>Ms Nia Di­nata to de­velop the In­done­sian ver­sion of the US se­ries Gos­sip Girl, which chron­i­cled the highs and lows of priv­i­leged teenagers in New York’s Up­per East Side, the film di­rec­tor knew just how to make it res­onate at home.</p>
    <p>In con­trast to the US se­ries, it was “more goodie-goodie hyp­o­crit­i­cal fam­i­lies, less in­de­pen­dent chil­dren” for In­done­sia, says Ms Nia, who has a sep­a­rate deal on a yet to be an­nounced show with Net­flix.</p>
    <p>Gos­sip Girl In­done­sia made its de­but on ride-hail­ing app Go­jek’s fledg­ling stream­ing ser­vice GoPlay in Fe­bru­ary. It has proved to be a hit for GoPlay, which raised an undis­closed amount of fund­ing for con­tent in June.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia’s 270 mil­lion peo­ple are starved for tele­vi­sion and cinema, ac­cord­ing to Mr Edy Sulistyo, who heads GoPlay. There are only 1,700 cinema screens scat­tered through­out the vast ar­chi­pel­ago.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve that con­sumers will al­ways be will­ing to pay for good con­tent,” Mr Edy tells The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Dis­ney has rights to 300 In­done­sian ti­tles and ex­clu­sive deals with half a dozen pro­duc­tion com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>“Our cur­rent fo­cus in In­done­sia is to pro­vide au­di­ences there with the best con­tent from all our brands, as well as lo­cal con­tent,” says Ms Christina Han, a spokesman for Dis­ney.</p>
    <p>“We’re pleased to be col­lab­o­rat­ing with In­done­sian stu­dios to bring lo­cally rel­e­vant con­tent to the plat­form.”</p>
