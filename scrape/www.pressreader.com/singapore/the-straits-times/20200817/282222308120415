    <p>The num­bers 700, 9988, 9618 and 9999 are un­likely to be sig­nif­i­cant in nu­merol­ogy or some sought-after 4-D num­bers, but in­vestors are in­creas­ingly able to rat­tle them off as eas­ily as they can place an or­der at a fast-food restau­rant counter.</p>
    <p>For the record, these num­bers are the tick­ers for Ten­cent, Alibaba, JD.com and NetEase.</p>
    <p>In­deed, Asia has caught the tech­nol­ogy eu­pho­ria, es­pe­cially North Asian high-growth tech firms en­joy­ing the same rally that has gripped United States mar­kets, led by the tech­nol­ogy and biotech sec­tors.</p>
    <p>There is a high con­cen­tra­tion of tech­nol­ogy stocks among the big-cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion firms in North Asia. These have seen spec­tac­u­lar gains this year, pro­pel­ling some into the rare US$1 tril­lion (S$1.37 tril­lion) mar­ket cap cat­e­gory that in­cludes Ap­ple, Ama­zon, Mi­crosoft and Al­pha­bet (Google).</p>
    <p>This op­ti­mism is largely sup­ported by mas­sive stim­u­lus from cen­tral banks and gov­ern­ments aimed at shield­ing economies from the dam­age of the pan­demic and to en­sure a faster re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic and re­mote work­ing ar­range­ments of many or­gan­i­sa­tions have ben­e­fited tech, soft­ware, ap­pli­ca­tions, e-com­merce and com­mu­ni­ca­tions-re­lated com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>This out­per­for­mance of growth ver­sus value stocks can be seen from the 21.4 per cent year-to-date gain for the iShares Rus­sell 1000 Growth In­dex ex­change-traded fund (ETF) ver­sus the 10.9 per cent de­cline for the iShares Rus­sell 1000 Value ETF.</p>
    <p>This trend is also sim­i­larly dis­played by the MSCI in­dexes. The broader bench­mark MSCI World In­dex is up only 1.4 per cent for the year, but the MSCI World Growth In­dex has surged ahead with a 16.1 per cent gain, far out­pac­ing the bench­mark in­dex.</p>
    <p>In com­par­i­son, the MSCI World Value In­dex is down 12.8 per cent for the year, se­verely un­der­per­form­ing the bench­mark in­dex.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, large-cap stocks have per­formed bet­ter than small caps. In this health cri­sis, size – as mea­sured by mar­ket cap – does mat­ter, as the MSCI World Large Cap In­dex is lead­ing with a 2.2 per cent gain so far this year, sur­pass­ing the mi­nus 5.7 per cent for the MSCI World Small Cap In­dex.</p>
    <p>Once again, the clear win­ners are growth stocks, and the big­ger the mar­ket cap, the bet­ter.</p>
    <p>With the stel­lar gains of growth stocks, val­u­a­tions have also rock­eted, de­spite weak eco­nomic data.</p>
    <p>As stocks go higher, more questions will emerge: Is this tech-led rally con­vinc­ing and how high will it go? Are the win­ners of to­day go­ing to be the win­ners of to­mor­row? Is a bit­ter win­ter ahead for mar­kets?</p>
    <p>Mar­kets have largely erased most of the losses seen dur­ing the on­set of the pan­demic. In­vestors and the mar­kets in gen­eral are ex­pect­ing more fis­cal stim­u­lus even if a sec­ond ma­jor wave of in­fec­tions hits.</p>
    <p>While signs are emerg­ing that eco­nomic data and cor­po­rate earn­ings are im­prov­ing, most are still not at pre-pan­demic lev­els. How­ever, based on cur­rent prices, mar­kets are pric­ing in a quick re­turn to nor­malcy and op­ti­mism about a broad-based im­prove­ment in global eco­nomic out­look.</p>
    <p>A cur­sory glance at key bench­mark equity in­dices gives a one-di­men­sional view that global equities have surged ahead, with sev­eral in­dices trad­ing at close to his­tor­i­cal all-time highs, ig­nor­ing weak eco­nomic out­looks and mixed cor­po­rate earn­ings out­looks.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a deeper dive into what pow­ered the strong re­bound in the past two months re­veals that gains were largely con­fined to sev­eral growth sec­tors, in­clud­ing tech­nol­ogy and bio-tech com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, many value and cycli­cal stocks have been left largely out of the re­cent up­trend.</p>
    <p>GAP AT ALL-TIME HIGH</p>
    <p>Con­sid­er­ing the S&P 500 Growth In­dex ver­sus the S&P 500 Value In­dex, the dis­crep­ancy be­comes clearer. As growth stocks pow­ered ahead and cleared the pre­vi­ous highs with con­sec­u­tive new highs since June, value stocks un­der­per­formed and are still trad­ing be­low the pre­vi­ous his­tor­i­cal high. The gap be­tween growth and value stocks has also widened sharply to a re­cent high early this month.</p>
    <p>As a com­par­i­son, from 2006 to 2017, the gap was an av­er­age dif­fer­ence of 106. From 2018 to last year, it widened to 579. At the start of this year, the gap was 866 but in June it widened steeply to an av­er­age of 1,049 (from June to this month).</p>
    <p>It is be­com­ing in­creas­ingly ob­vi­ous that the big­ger, stronger, bet­ter-funded and cash-rich growth com­pa­nies are likely to sur­pass the rest of the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>This is due to their strong rev­enue and earn­ings mo­men­tum, as well as their abil­ity to gain mar­ket share and have ready ac­cess to funds to fi­nance op­er­a­tions and ex­pan­sion.</p>
    <p>Key sec­tors that suf­fered the brunt of the sell­ing pres­sure at the height of the pan­demic are still down for the year. They in­clude air­lines, en­ergy, bank­ing, trans­port, ho­tels, restau­rants, and oth­ers such as leisure, re­tail, con­sumer ser­vices, in­sur­ance and real es­tate.</p>
    <p>VALUE IN VALUE</p>
    <p>For cycli­cal sec­tors, such as fi­nan­cial, real es­tate, in­dus­trial and ma­te­ri­als, the dis­mal share price per­for­mance is likely to im­prove as economies re­cover. With the cur­rent widen­ing gap be­tween growth and value stocks, pru­dent in­vestors should con­sider re­bal­anc­ing their equity port­fo­lios and mov­ing into some value and cycli­cal stocks.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, per­sis­tently low in­ter­est rates, which are likely to stretch into 2022, will also favour value stocks with healthy div­i­dends.</p>
    <p>An­other note­wor­thy trend is that de­spite ten­sions be­tween the US and Bei­jing, com­pa­nies with China ex­po­sure have out­per­formed the broader mar­ket.</p>
    <p>This is largely due to ex­pec­ta­tions that China will be the first ma­jor econ­omy to show signs of re­cov­ery from the pan­demic. It is also sup­ported by en­cour­ag­ing eco­nomic num­bers as busi­ness picks up.</p>
    <p>Op­ti­mism about vac­cines will also help to spark in­ter­est in most sec­tors that were hard hit by the pan­demic, in­clud­ing banks, real es­tate, and re­tail-re­lated stocks.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the mar­ket has un­der­per­formed most re­gional and global mar­kets, with a year-to-date de­cline of 19.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>We be­lieve that as economies re­open and eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity picks up, the hunt for value and yields will re­turn.</p>
    <p>Our picks in the value and cycli­cal sec­tors in­clude As­cen­das Reit, Cap­i­taLand Com­mer­cial Trust, Cap­i­taLand, Cap­i­taLand Mall Trust, City De­vel­op­ments, Frasers Lo­gis­tics and Com­mer­cial Trust, NetLink NBN Trust, Sing­tel, ST En­gi­neer­ing, Sun­tec Reit, United Overseas Bank and UOL Group.</p>
