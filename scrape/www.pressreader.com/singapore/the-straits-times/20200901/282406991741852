    <p>WELLING­TON • New Zealand’s stock market was hit by a fifth day of cy­ber at­tacks yes­ter­day, which led to its web­site crash­ing. But it con­tin­ued trad­ing af­ter switch­ing to a con­tin­gency plan for the re­lease of market an­nounce­ments.</p>
    <p>NZX was halted for most of last week due to the at­tacks, which the au­thor­i­ties have said orig­i­nated off­shore.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s at­tack came shortly af­ter NZX said it had agreed with the Fi­nan­cial Mar­kets Au­thor­ity on a backup plan for the re­lease of market an­nounce­ments.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for NZX con­firmed the web­site was down, but said trad­ing, which be­gan at 10am, was con­tin­u­ing as usual through the con­tin­gency ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>He de­clined to com­ment on who was be­hind the at­tacks, whether there had been any ex­tor­tion de­mand or what mea­sures have been put in place to stop fu­ture at­tacks.</p>
    <p>The bourse said in a state­ment that the ex­change was work­ing with its net­work’s ser­vice provider, Spark, govern­ment cy­ber-se­cu­rity agen­cies, and US-based cy­ber-se­cu­rity firm Aka­mai Tech­nolo­gies to im­ple­ment ex­tra se­cu­rity steps.</p>
    <p>“NZX has been ad­vised by in­de­pen­dent cy­ber spe­cial­ists that the at­tacks last week are among the largest, most well-re­sourced and so­phis­ti­cated they have ever seen in New Zealand,” NZX chief ex­ec­u­tive Mark Peter­son said.</p>
    <p>The bourse faced dis­rup­tions for four days last week when it was hit re­peat­edly by dis­trib­uted de­nial of ser­vice at­tacks, a com­mon way to dis­rupt a server by over­whelm­ing it with a flood of In­ter­net traf­fic.</p>
    <p>The at­tacks forced NZX to halt trad­ing in its cash mar­kets, dis­rupt­ing op­er­a­tions in its debt market, Fon­terra Share­hold­ers Market and de­riv­a­tives market.</p>
    <p>NZX said its core trad­ing plat­forms were not hit in last week’s at­tacks but the pub­lic-fac­ing web­site crashed, af­fect­ing the ex­change’s abil­ity to pub­lish market an­nounce­ments. “At those times, NZX made the de­ci­sion to halt the market in or­der to main­tain market in­tegrity.”</p>
    <p>New Zealand, a rel­a­tively small econ­omy with a pop­u­la­tion of five mil­lion, is not of­ten the target of such at­tacks but neigh­bour­ing Aus­tralia ramped up its cy­ber se­cu­rity this year af­ter a rise in sim­i­lar in­ci­dents.</p>
