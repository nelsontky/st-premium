    <p>A con­sor­tium formed by the three largest share­hold­ers of Teck­wah In­dus­trial has an­nounced a vol­un­tary con­di­tional cash of­fer of 65 cents per share to take Teck­wah pri­vate, in a bourse fil­ing late on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The of­feror has al­ready se­cured ir­rev­o­ca­ble un­der­tak­ings of 58.04 per cent of shares, with the of­fer con­di­tional on re­ceiv­ing valid ac­cep­tances of 90 per cent and above.</p>
    <p>Cle­men­tine In­vest­ments is the bid ve­hi­cle for a con­sor­tium formed by Chua Seng Tek Hold­ings, Lee Kay Huan Hold­ings and Air­jet In­vest­ments, which in­tends to delist the com­pany from the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change to en­able “more flex­i­bil­ity to man­age the busi­ness of the com­pany and op­ti­mise the use of the com­pany’s man­age­ment and re­sources dur­ing this time of eco­nomic un­cer­tainty”.</p>
    <p>Teck­wah, a pack­ag­ing, print­ing and lo­gis­tics firm, is led by chair­man and man­ag­ing direc­tor Thomas Chua, the el­dest son of the late Chua Seng Tek, who founded the com­pany.</p>
    <p>The of­fer price of 65 cents in cash per share rep­re­sents pre­mi­ums of ap­prox­i­mately 30 per cent over the clos­ing price on July 27 and 42.5 per cent over the 12-month vol­ume-weighted av­er­age price. The of­fer price ex­ceeds the highest ever clos­ing price of 55.5 cents per share on Aug 4 and Aug 7.</p>
    <p>The of­feror will not deduct the in­terim div­i­dend of 0.5 Sin­ga­pore cent per share from the of­fer price. Share­hold­ers will still be en­ti­tled to the in­terim div­i­dend if they ac­cept the of­fer.</p>
    <p>The of­fer price is said to be fi­nal and will not be re­vised by the of­feror.</p>
    <p>The of­feror said this is an “at­trac­tive op­por­tu­nity” for share­hold­ers to exit their en­tire in­vest­ment in cash with price cer­tainty and with­out in­cur­ring bro­ker­age costs.</p>
    <p>It added that this may oth­er­wise be dif­fi­cult be­cause of the low trad­ing liq­uid­ity of the shares and the chal­leng­ing macro and op­er­at­ing en­vi­ron­ment due to the Covid-19 pan­demic and the un­re­solved trade ne­go­ti­a­tions be­tween China and the United States.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment came after Teck­wah’s half-year re­sults, where it posted a net profit of $5.29 mil­lion for the half year ended June 30, up 16.2 per cent from a year ago, on the back of an in­crease in other in­come re­ceived from gov­ern­ment sup­port schemes to deal with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue ticked down 2.5 per cent to $76.69 mil­lion, dragged down by a de­cline in its pack­ag­ing print­ing-re­lated busi­ness, which makes up about half of its rev­enue.</p>
    <p>Teck­wah In­dus­trial was re­cently in the cross hairs of ac­tivist share­holder Quarz, which wrote in a let­ter on July 28 that the firm should re­turn more cash to share­hold­ers as div­i­dends, to ad­dress what Quarz sees as a lack of cash dis­ci­pline and op­er­a­tional ef­fi­ciency.</p>
    <p>Quarz is the fourth-largest share­holder of Teck­wah with a stake of more than 6 per cent.</p>
    <p>Teck­wah stressed the need for a sound cash man­age­ment pol­icy but Quarz was not con­vinced.</p>
    <p>“We are work­ing on a list of pro­pos­als to un­lock share­holder value at Teck­wah, and will be shar­ing them with the pub­lic and fel­low share­hold­ers in due course,” said Quarz, in an ear­lier state­ment.</p>
    <p>Teck­wah had re­quested for a trad­ing halt on Tues­day. It last traded at 55 cents.</p>
