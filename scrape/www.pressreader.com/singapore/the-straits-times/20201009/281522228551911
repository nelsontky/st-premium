    <p>Most week­ends, my golf­ing quar­tet in­cludes a friend named Amos Ng, and it is the rare out­ing that he does not bring up Bol­ly­wood, which he seems to fol­low more closely than I do.</p>
    <p>There are few Aamir Khan movies this Sin­ga­porean busi­ness­man has missed, and last week­end he sur­prised me by talk­ing of an­other pro­duc­tion called Bahubali, of which I was not aware.</p>
    <p>It speaks to the im­por­tance of In­dia’s big­gest cul­tural ex­port – the fruits of a fre­netic in­dus­try that churns out close to a thou­sand films ev­ery year in a dozen lan­guages – that its reach is so long, even out­side In­dia.</p>
    <p>The films have also proved a ten­u­ous glue in some tricky bi­lat­eral ties. These days, when re­la­tions be­tween Asia’s two largest na­tions are in a se­vere dip, the movies emerg­ing from Mum­bai, or Bom­bay as it used to be called (hence, Bol­ly­wood), are use­ful re­minders of so much that is still com­mon be­tween China and In­dia.</p>
    <p>I once heard Aamir Khan say that he sat qui­etly in the au­di­ence when one of his hit movies, Dan­gal (Wrestling Match), was be­ing screened in a hall in China and the au­di­ence re­acted to the same emo­tional touch points as did movie­go­ers in his own coun­try.</p>
    <p>Within In­dia, Bol­ly­wood’s cul­tural im­pact is colos­sal, over­shad­ow­ing other film cen­tres such as Chen­nai, Hy­der­abad and Kolkata. Watch Mum­bai’s packed com­muter trains and you might spot a young­ster rid­ing on the roof, tilt­ing his head just in time to avoid an ap­proach­ing cable, just as he might fancy a movie hero do­ing. Dozens of young ta­lents ar­rive in the huge me­trop­o­lis ev­ery week hop­ing for a chance at star­dom.</p>
    <p>CITY OF DREAMS, DRUGS AND POL­I­TICS</p>
    <p>Mum­bai also hap­pens to be In­dia’s wealth­i­est city and the cap­i­tal of its most pros­per­ous state, Ma­ha­rash­tra, rather in the way Cal­i­for­nia is to the United States. It also at­tracts the at­ten­tion of the un­der­world, which once thrived on gold smug­gling but has since turned to ex­tor­tion and, re­port­edly, drugs, af­ter the gov­ern­ment freed up im­ports of the yel­low me­tal.</p>
    <p>For sev­eral rea­sons, there­fore, Mum­bai – and Ma­ha­rash­tra – are a prize catch for In­dia’s po­lit­i­cal par­ties.</p>
    <p>These days, the state and the city, in­clud­ing its mas­sively funded</p>
    <p>Greater Mum­bai Mu­nic­i­pal Cor­po­ra­tion, are con­trolled by the Shiv Sena party, a na­tivist out­fit qui­etly en­cour­aged by the once-dom­i­nant Congress party in the 1970s to take on the late Datta Sa­mant, a pow­er­ful trade union boss who had paral­ysed the city’s tex­tile in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>While the Shiv Sena has taken on a Hindu na­tion­al­ist pro­file in the past two decades, it has cut its al­liance with Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is eye­ing the state for it­self. More irk­some for the BJP, Shiv Sena rules Ma­ha­rash­tra with the help of Congress and an­other re­gional party.</p>
    <p>It was into this city of dreams that Sushant Singh Ra­jput, a 1.78m-tall, well-mus­cled young man from far­away Bi­har state, ar­rived some 15 years ago af­ter for­sak­ing an education in en­gi­neer­ing. Un­like most oth­ers who found only dis­ap­point­ment, Ra­jput achieved a mea­sure of suc­cess over the past decade, start­ing in tele­vi­sion and mi­grat­ing to movie roles, some of which won crit­i­cal ac­claim and com­mer­cial suc­cess.</p>
    <p>But, ac­cord­ing to sev­eral me­dia re­ports, he was also strug­gling with a drug habit, in­som­nia and bipo­lar dis­or­der. On June 14, the 34-year-old star was found dead in his home, hang­ing from the ceil­ing fan. Mum­bai po­lice, In­dia’s best-re­garded po­lice force, filed the case as a sui­cide.</p>
    <p>The death has stayed on na­tional headlines since, of­ten out­do­ing dire news on the econ­omy and a tense bor­der stand-off with China, not to speak of a spread­ing pan­demic that has placed In­dia next only to the US in the mor­bid­ity count.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the ac­tor’s fam­ily dis­puted the po­lice ver­sion of death by sui­cide and fin­gered Ra­jput’s ac­tress girl­friend Rhea</p>
    <p>Chakrabort­y for al­legedly abet­ting his death and feed­ing his drug habit, the state gov­ern­ment in Bi­har, which is al­lied with BJP and headed for state assem­bly polls, took up the case as a po­lit­i­cal is­sue.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral au­thor­i­ties moved in rapidly. Chakrabort­y and more than a dozen oth­ers were ar­rested. The Cen­tral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion, which re­ports to Mr Modi, has taken over the case. The fed­eral En­force­ment Direc­torate, which han­dles il­le­gal money flows, is in­volved in the in­ves­ti­ga­tion and so too the Nar­cotics Con­trol Bureau (NCB) – un­usual since drug of­fences are usu­ally han­dled at the sta­tion house level.</p>
    <p>A pro­ces­sion of ac­tresses, in­clud­ing one who joined an anti-Modi gov­ern­ment stu­dent protest in New Delhi some months ago, have been ques­tioned by the fed­eral agen­cies. Mas­sive air time and news­pa­per acreage have been de­voted to Bol­ly­wood’s seamier side, its clubby na­ture and pro­cliv­ity to shun those who do not be­long to favoured cliques.</p>
    <p>A med­i­cal board from the pres­ti­gious All In­dia In­sti­tute of Med­i­cal Sci­ences has en­dorsed the sui­cide fil­ing. On Wed­nes­day, the</p>
    <p>Bom­bay High Court threw out the NCB’s case against Chakrabort­y and re­leased her on bail, not ac­cept­ing its charge that she was an ac­tive mem­ber of a drug syn­di­cate. It also dis­agreed with the NCB’s po­si­tion that high-pro­file peo­ple should be treated harshly to set an ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>No one dis­putes that there is much about Bol­ly­wood that needs fix­ing. It is also undis­puted that Bol­ly­wood is part of the heroin and am­phet­a­mine scourge spread­ing across the coun­try, with syn­di­cates re­port­edly at­tempt­ing to in­tro­duce the habit to stu­dents by hav­ing ice-cream stalls out­side schools lace pop­si­cles with drugs.</p>
    <p>The Modi gov­ern­ment in New Delhi, which is fo­cused on na­tional se­cu­rity, in­her­ited this sit­u­a­tion, and if any gov­ern­ment has the will to check this men­ace, it has to be this one.</p>
    <p>SOFT POWER AND NA­TIONAL GLUE</p>
    <p>Yet, In­dia needs to be care­ful that in try­ing to fix Bol­ly­wood, it does not break it.</p>
    <p>Its in­ter­nal fis­sures are ev­i­dent. The bril­liant char­ac­ter ac­tress Kan­gana Ra­naut and other fig­ures such as Ak­shaye Khanna and the durable legend Amitabh Bachchan are ei­ther vo­cif­er­ously pro-Modi gov­ern­ment or omi­nously silent in stand­ing up for col­leagues un­der the gun. Many In­di­ans are ask­ing them­selves if they should be so wild about a bunch of self-ob­sessed, pos­si­bly dys­func­tional, ta­lents and alarmed that their fan sup­port might be feed­ing crim­i­nal ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>But Bol­ly­wood, for all its in­ter­nal prob­lems, is more than an en­ter­tain­ment fac­tory. Films are also a key source of the coun­try’s soft power as well as a na­tional glue.</p>
    <p>Soviet-In­dia ties were lifted in the 1950s and 1960s by the Rus­sian craze for the late Raj Kapoor, whose ex­tended fam­ily con­tin­ues to have a large pres­ence in Hindi films. Since 1998, when his Muthu be­gan a 100-day box of­fice run in Ja­pan amid wide­spread eco­nomic gloom, the Tamil film hero Ra­jinikanth has en­joyed a mas­sive fol­low­ing in that coun­try. In­deed, Dr Man­mo­han Singh, who was then In­dia’s Prime Min­is­ter, was said to have re­ceived a stand­ing ova­tion from Diet mem­bers when he in­formed his au­di­ence that he was aware of the pop­u­lar­ity of “Odori Ma­haraja” (Danc­ing Ma­haraja).</p>
    <p>The film in­dus­try also holds a mir­ror to In­dia’s sense of self. In the 1950s, the hand­some Mo­hammed Yusuf Khan was known to ador­ing In­di­ans as Dilip Ku­mar af­ter he chose a Hindu screen name bet­ter suited to the times – In­dia had just emerged from the fu­ries of its bloody Par­ti­tion when Pak­istan was cleaved out as a na­tion for Mus­lims.</p>
    <p>It is a trib­ute to In­dia’s na­tion-build­ing that to­day mu­sic pro­ducer A.R. Rah­man, an Os­car win­ner, who was called Dileep Ku­mar at birth and gained his Mus­lim name af­ter his fam­ily con­verted to Is­lam, has not seen his new re­li­gious iden­tity dim­ming his pop­u­lar­ity in the pre­dom­i­nantly Hindu na­tion. Crit­ics of Mr Modi and the Hindu-ori­ented BJP would say that this, pre­cisely, is why the party is wary of Bol­ly­wood and seeks to put its own stamp upon it. In­dia’s three lead­ing male stars – Shah Rukh Khan, Sal­man Khan and Aamir Khan – are Mus­lims.</p>
    <p>An­noy­ingly for BJP, Shah Rukh is par­tic­u­larly close to the Gandhi sib­lings who run the Congress party, Rahul and Priyanka, while Aamir’s wife Ki­ran Rao once openly mused about leav­ing In­dia, with mi­nori­ties feel­ing a sense of siege in BJP-ruled In­dia.</p>
    <p>Sal­man, for his part, has been an en­thu­si­as­tic par­tic­i­pant in the Shiv Sena-pro­moted fes­ti­val for Lord Gane­sha for two decades and even men­tioned as a po­ten­tial Congress can­di­date from Mad­hya Pradesh, his home state.</p>
    <p>BE­YOND BOL­LY­WOOD</p>
    <p>On Sept 18, the chief min­is­ter of Ut­tar Pradesh state, run by the BJP, an­nounced plans to build the “big­gest and most beau­ti­ful” film city on 400ha of land, just across the bor­der from Delhi. The idea, clearly, is to lure some of Bol­ly­wood into the Hindi heart­land.</p>
    <p>Amid Bol­ly­wood’s re­cent strug­gles, it is worth pon­der­ing why if film-mak­ing in Asia – whether in In­dia or Hong Kong – is so messed up and yet so prof­itable, other ju­ris­dic­tions should not be as­sess­ing it for a business op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>At no time has there been such hunger for orig­i­nal con­tent, whether for tele­vi­sion or the big screen.</p>
    <p>Ports be­ing moved else­where or un­used ex­hi­bi­tion grounds can free up space for movie stu­dios. Less de­vel­oped is­lands like Sin­ga­pore’s Pu­lau Ubin as well as the Malaysian hin­ter­land pro­vide ex­cel­lent lo­cales for the in­evitable rus­tic set­tings of many Asian films. The fi­nan­cial ser­vices in­dus­try would be happy to ser­vice the le­git­i­mate fi­nanc­ing needs of pro­duc­ers.</p>
    <p>And Bol­ly­wood is not the only op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>If the on­go­ing tech and sup­ply chain de­cou­pling should de­velop into a cul­tural sep­a­ra­tion be­tween China and the rest, there surely must be prospects of cater­ing to global pop­u­lar cul­ture from a neu­tral venue.</p>
    <p>Just as Mr Peter Seah was tasked in the late 1990s with lead­ing a com­mit­tee to bring more buzz to Sin­ga­pore, maybe it is time to ask a Ho Kwon Ping or a Koh Boon Hwee to see if parts of In­dia’s or Hong Kong’s film industries can be lured across. Who knows, it may even help fire up the Sin­ga­pore me­dia scene.</p>
    <p>There will be some im­pact on so­ci­ety, of course. But surely, if an is­land can host two casino re­sorts with­out sig­nif­i­cant dan­ger to its so­ci­ety, a film in­dus­try need do no worse.</p>
