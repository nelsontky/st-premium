    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans must learn to han­dle their dif­fer­ences con­struc­tively, and find com­mon ground to build a broad con­sen­sus on is­sues core to the coun­try’s sur­vival and fu­ture, said Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob.</p>
    <p>Their ex­pec­ta­tions and choices will de­ter­mine the kind of pol­i­tics Sin­ga­pore will have, she added, with the key question be­ing how to forge com­mon cause de­spite dif­fer­ing po­lit­i­cal views.</p>
    <p>In her tra­di­tional ad­dress at the open­ing of the 14th term of Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day, the Pres­i­dent noted that more dif­fer­ences in views and in­ter­ests among Sin­ga­pore­ans are to be ex­pected, given the mag­ni­tude of the chal­lenges and un­cer­tain­ties.</p>
    <p>“On some is­sues, we can agree to dis­agree. But on is­sues core to Sin­ga­pore and our sur­vival and fu­ture, we must do our best to find com­mon ground and build a broad con­sen­sus,” she said.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment, she added, “will be open to con­struc­tive crit­i­cism and ra­tio­nal de­bate, and to new ways of do­ing things”.</p>
    <p>But hav­ing been elected by the peo­ple, it must also gov­ern for ev­ery­one, she said. “It can­not shy away from tak­ing dif­fi­cult and tough de­ci­sions in the na­tional in­ter­est, or shirk the duty of win­ning sup­port for such de­ci­sions.”</p>
    <p>Last month, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong noted in his speech at the swear­ing-in of the new Cab­i­net that Sin­ga­pore’s po­lit­i­cal sys­tem will have to evolve to ac­com­mo­date the strong de­sire for greater di­ver­sity of views in pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>In her ad­dress, Madam Hal­imah noted that one sig­nif­i­cant change is the ap­point­ment of Work­ers’ Party (WP) chief Pri­tam Singh as the for­mal Leader of the Op­po­si­tion, re­flect­ing the larger num­ber of op­po­si­tion MPs in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>There are 10 WP MPs and two Progress Sin­ga­pore Party Non-Con­stituency MPs in the new term of Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah said both the Govern­ment and op­po­si­tion have roles to play to build trust in pub­lic in­sti­tu­tions, and achieve good out­comes for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Be­sides rais­ing ques­tions and crit­i­cisms of govern­ment poli­cies, the op­po­si­tion should put forth pol­icy al­ter­na­tives to be scru­ti­nised and de­bated, she added.</p>
    <p>“And when the sit­u­a­tion de­mands, both the Govern­ment and op­po­si­tion should set aside dif­fer­ences and work to­gether to se­cure the safety and fu­ture of our na­tion.”</p>
    <p>She also urged Sin­ga­pore­ans to work harder at break­ing out of their echo cham­bers and making gen­uine at­tempts to bridge the gap with those who think dif­fer­ently.</p>
    <p>Th­ese must also be the guid­ing prin­ci­ples of pol­i­tics in Sin­ga­pore, she said, with Par­lia­ment the cen­tral plat­form to de­bate na­tional poli­cies and set the tone for the coun­try’s po­lit­i­cal dis­course.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans’ ex­pec­ta­tions and choices will de­ter­mine the kind of pol­i­tics in Sin­ga­pore, the Pres­i­dent said.</p>
    <p>“We need to base our rhetoric on a re­spon­si­ble sense of the re­al­i­ties, and come to a shared un­der­stand­ing about our goals and con­straints,” she added. “Our pub­lic de­bates should be hon­est and open about the trade-offs of dif­fer­ent op­tions, and what they will cost so­ci­ety. Only in this way will our sys­tem con­tinue to en­cour­age able and com­mit­ted in­di­vid­u­als to step for­ward to serve.”</p>
    <p>The ul­ti­mate goal is for Sin­ga­pore to evolve in a way that en­gages the as­pi­ra­tions and cre­ative en­er­gies of its peo­ple, she added.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore­ans as­pire to make this a bet­ter place, and have in­ter­est­ing and di­verse ideas to pur­sue. Such a di­ver­sity of views and ideas can be a source of strength, for us to nav­i­gate the chal­lenges and pos­si­bil­i­ties ahead.”</p>
    <p>But to re­alise this strength, Sin­ga­pore­ans need a sense of com­mon pur­pose and a readi­ness to act to make a dif­fer­ence for causes that they care about. This is the spirit of Sin­ga­pore To­gether, and all Sin­ga­pore­ans are in­vited to part­ner with the Govern­ment on this jour­ney, she said.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore­ans must come to­gether, in part­ner­ship, to pur­sue the greater good, united by a be­lief in Sin­ga­pore and a de­sire to turn our vi­sion into re­al­ity.”</p>
