    <p>If you have di­a­betes, hy­per­ten­sion or are obese, you are more likely to be se­verely af­fected by Covid-19 or to die from it.</p>
    <p>These non-com­mu­ni­ca­ble dis­eases (NCDs) were the most com­mon co­mor­bidi­ties iden­ti­fied in Covid-19 pa­tients hos­pi­talised in the New York City area, ac­cord­ing to a study pub­lished in The Jour­nal of the Amer­i­can Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion in April. This re­la­tion­ship has also been ob­served glob­ally. Some es­ti­mates are that up to 90 per cent of peo­ple dy­ing from Covid-19 also had an NCD.</p>
    <p>As coun­try after coun­try im­posed lock­downs to con­tain the virus spread, so­cial dis­tanc­ing and quar­an­tine re­stric­tions af­fected the abil­ity of peo­ple with NCDs to ac­cess care and reg­u­lar med­i­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>In­ter­rupted NCD ser­vices were re­ported in 75 per cent of coun­tries, ac­cord­ing to the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO). This has led to in­creased com­pli­ca­tions and more deaths.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther stud­ies show that Covid-19 sur­vivors with NCDs may see their pre-ex­ist­ing con­di­tions worsen, and pre­vi­ously healthy Covid-19 pa­tients may suf­fer car­dio­vas­cu­lar dam­age, lead­ing to com­plex NCD cases in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>The in­ter­play be­tween Covid-19 and NCDs is deadly.</p>
    <p>And yet, there is a great global op­por­tu­nity here. The same tools we are us­ing to fight the pan­demic are those re­quired to fight NCDs.</p>
    <p>While pre­vent­ing Covid-19 is still an un­cer­tain med­i­cal sci­ence and treat­ment is at an ex­per­i­men­tal stage, we know that a way to re­duce Covid-19 deaths is to pre­vent, re­duce and treat NCDs. These pro­to­cols are well es­tab­lished and re­sult in fewer deaths.</p>
    <p>We know how to re­duce the risks of NCDs.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore was able to mount a strong re­sponse to Covid-19, con­sid­er­ing its care­ful in­vest­ment in health­care over many years. Com­pre­hen­sive screen­ing and test­ing is crit­i­cal to re­duc­ing the risk of death from NCDs. WHO data shows Sin­ga­pore is a world leader in achiev­ing this, with just 247.8 deaths due to NCDs per 100,000 peo­ple in 2016, down from 408.5 per 100,000 in 2000. Deaths can be as high as 900 per 100,000 pop­u­la­tion else­where.</p>
    <p>It is there­fore no sur­prise that Sin­ga­pore’s cur­rent Covid-19 case fa­tal­ity rate is less than 0.1 per cent, com­pared with the Asian av­er­age of 1.8 per cent or global av­er­age of 2.9 per cent.</p>
    <p>Within Africa, Rwanda stands out, with Covid-19 deaths not ris­ing in pro­por­tion to in­creased test­ing. The land-locked re­pub­lic has a rare as­set among low- and mid­dle-in­come coun­tries – uni­ver­sal health cov­er­age. De­liv­ered through a govern­ment-funded health in­sur­ance pro­gramme, there was al­ready wide­spread screen­ing for NCDs and preven­tion and treat­ment be­fore Covid-19 struck.</p>
    <p>Over US$180 bil­lion (S$244.3 bil­lion) has been com­mit­ted to tack­ling Covid-19 by global de­vel­op­ment in­sti­tu­tions such as the World Bank, Asian De­vel­op­ment Bank and African De­vel­op­ment Bank. The fig­ure ex­cludes yet more by gov­ern­ments and phil­an­thropic trust funds, such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently these funds are not be­ing in­vested in in­creas­ing NCD screen­ing, test­ing and strength­en­ing health sys­tems to care for NCDs in the long run.</p>
    <p>It is not too late to turn this around. The huge in­vest­ments chan­nelled to­wards the pan­demic are fun­gi­ble across Covid-19 and NCDs. Us­ing funds to sim­ply buy one-use per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment is not a sus­tain­able out­lay. Smarter stip­u­la­tions on how the money is be­ing spent need to be made. Im­prov­ing and in­creas­ing the ca­pac­ity of med­i­cal lab­o­ra­to­ries to test and screen for Covid-19 should in­clude the same for NCDs.</p>
    <p>The dis­ease sur­veil­lance and health in­for­ma­tion sys­tems be­ing strength­ened to track and re­port Covid-19 must also be used for NCDs. In Mum­bai, In­dia, the monthly case mor­tal­ity of Covid-19 was brought down in the first two months of the pan­demic by sur­vey­ing slum pop­u­la­tions for di­a­betes and hy­per­ten­sion along­side Covid-19 screen­ing, en­abling bet­ter tar­get­ing of NCD-af­fected el­derly per­sons.</p>
    <p>A global mar­ket­place where af­ford­able, qual­ity med­i­ca­tion and di­ag­nos­tics are avail­able to all would sup­port both Covid-19 and NCD re­sponses. To achieve these prac­ti­cal re­al­i­ties, a truly multi-sec­toral ap­proach is crit­i­cal. The De­feat-NCD Part­ner­ship ex­ists to bring rel­e­vant pri­vate and pub­lic sec­tor ac­tors to­gether with civil so­ci­ety. For in­stance, its tech­ni­cal staff sit within Myan­mar’s Min­istry of Health, sup­port­ing the in­clu­sion of NCDs in na­tional Covid-19 plans.</p>
    <p>For once, a lack of money is not the bar­rier to grasp­ing this op­por­tu­nity. The chal­lenge in­stead is mak­ing the ef­fort to re-en­gi­neer the re­la­tion­ship be­tween ad­dress­ing the twin pub­lic health threats of Covid-19 and NCDs.</p>
    <p>Next Mon­day, the World Health</p>
    <p>Sum­mit in Ber­lin will bring to­gether the health min­is­ters of Myan­mar, Rwanda, Gam­bia, Ecuador and Bhutan, in­ter­na­tional agen­cies such as the WHO and the Asian De­vel­op­ment Bank, as well as pri­vate phi­lan­thropies Boehringer In­gel­heim and the Helm­s­ley Char­i­ta­ble Trust, to mo­bilise global ac­tion against NCDs and Covid-19.</p>
    <p>We are at a crit­i­cal junc­ture. A legacy of re­duc­ing pre­ma­ture deaths from NCDs, born out of the ashes of Covid-19, is what we must achieve.</p>
