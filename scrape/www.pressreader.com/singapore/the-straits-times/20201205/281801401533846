    <p>WILMINGTON • US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den has named Mr Brian Deese, who helped lead pres­i­dent Barack Obama’s ef­forts to bail out the au­to­mo­tive in­dus­try and ne­go­ti­ate the Paris cli­mate agree­ment, as his top eco­nomic ad­viser.</p>
    <p>Mr Deese, 42, would be the youngest per­son to head the Na­tional Eco­nomic Coun­cil. His ap­point­ment sig­nals Mr Bi­den’s in­ten­tion to put cli­mate change at the heart of his plans for re­viv­ing the United States econ­omy in the wake of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Deese is “a trusted voice I can count on to help us end the on­go­ing eco­nomic cri­sis, build a bet­ter econ­omy that deals every­body in, and take on the ex­is­ten­tial threat of cli­mate change in a way that cre­ates good-pay­ing Amer­i­can jobs”, Mr Bi­den said.</p>
    <p>Mr Deese said he would push for “bold, new ac­tions” needed to com­bat cli­mate change and ad­dress the racial in­equities that he said were at the core of the cli­mate cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The US needs to re­join the Paris cli­mate ac­cord, he said, and push “far beyond” it to meet Mr Bi­den’s goal of achiev­ing a net-zero emis­sions econ­omy be­fore 2050.</p>
    <p>The cli­mate fo­cus marks a sharp de­par­ture from the Don­ald Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion. Mr Trump has re­ferred to cli­mate change as a “hoax”, ques­tioned the sci­ence and in 2017 pulled the US out of the Paris Agree­ment – a de­ci­sion which took ef­fect on Nov 4.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion, Mr Deese served as deputy di­rec­tor of the White House Of­fice of Man­age­ment and Bud­get and the Na­tional Eco­nomic Coun­cil, and as a se­nior cli­mate and en­ergy ad­viser to the pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>In 2017, he was named head of sus­tain­able in­vest­ment at US$7.4 tril­lion (S$9.9 tril­lion) as­set gi­ant Black­Rock, which is shed­ding some coal in­vest­ments but still in­vests heav­ily in fos­sil fuel com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>His Black­Rock role prompted an out­cry from some en­vi­ron­men­tal and pro­gres­sive groups, who said he was not ag­gres­sive enough on cli­mate change and would have to re­cuse him­self from some de­ci­sions un­der fed­eral laws.</p>
    <p>Mr Evan We­ber, co-founder of the pro­gres­sive Sun­rise Move­ment, said on Thurs­day that Mr Deese’s ap­point­ment and what he called the “re­volv­ing door be­tween Wall Street and the White House” did not in­spire con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in re­cent days, for­mer Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials, pro­gres­sives in the Demo­cratic Party and en­vi­ron­men­tal­ist Bill McKibben have come to Mr Deese’s de­fence. Mr McKibben said Mr Deese told him last win­ter that he had spent his time at Black­Rock push­ing for change to the com­pany’s cli­mate poli­cies, and that Mr Deese un­der­stood it had not yet gone far enough.</p>
    <p>Separately, a month af­ter the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, Mr Bi­den’s elec­tion mar­gin over Mr Trump widened to more than seven mil­lion votes on Thurs­day, even as Mr Trump and sup­port­ers per­sisted in claims of fraud.</p>
    <p>New local tal­lies from New York drove Mr Bi­den’s to­tal to 81,264,673 votes, com­pared with Mr Trump’s 74,210,838, with a to­tal of 158.4 mil­lion votes counted so far, ac­cord­ing to data com­piled by the Cook Po­lit­i­cal Re­port. That gave Mr Bi­den a solid 4.4 per­cent­age point mar­gin over Mr Trump. Mr Bi­den cap­tured 306 elec­toral votes for his vic­to­ries in in­di­vid­ual states, well past the 270 needed to win.</p>
