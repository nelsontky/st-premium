    <p>Some 13,000 work­ers who have yet to un­dergo ros­tered rou­tine test­ing for the coro­n­avirus as at Sun­day will be barred from re­turn­ing to work.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the author­i­ties said that the Ac­cessCode sta­tus of these work­ers will re­main red, mean­ing that they can­not re­turn to work un­til they are tested.</p>
    <p>“This is to pro­tect the health and safety of the other work­ers,” they said, adding that the work­ers’ sta­tus would be changed to green af­ter they are tested.</p>
    <p>In a joint state­ment, the Min­istry of Man­power, the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity, the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board and the Health Pro­mo­tion Board said they had en­gaged em­ploy­ers and re­minded them to sched­ule their work­ers for test­ing be­fore the dead­line last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The author­i­ties added that they had also en­sured there were suf­fi­cient slots for book­ing when the dead­line was an­nounced, and pro­vided guid­ance and help to em­ploy­ers who were fac­ing dif­fi­cul­ties sched­ul­ing their work­ers for the tests.</p>
    <p>The need for such test­ing was an­nounced on Aug 11, with the author­i­ties say­ing work­ers in higher-risk set­tings would have to un­dergo a swab test ev­ery 14 days.</p>
    <p>On Aug 22, the author­i­ties set a dead­line of Sept 5 for the first test to be con­ducted.</p>
    <p>On the night be­fore the dead­line, about 16,000 work­ers had yet to be sched­uled for the tests.</p>
    <p>At the time, the agen­cies warned that “un­re­spon­sive em­ploy­ers” who “per­sis­tently failed to sched­ule work­ers for ros­tered rou­tine test­ing” may have their work pass priv­i­leges cur­tailed.</p>
    <p>The agen­cies em­pha­sised that em­ploy­ers should quickly sched­ule ap­point­ment slots for their work­ers on the Health Pro­mo­tion Board’s Swab Regis­tra­tion Sys­tem to avoid fur­ther dis­rup­tion to their busi­ness op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers in the con­struc­tion sec­tor with ques­tions on the re­quire­ments should write in to SRS_En­quiries@bca.gov.sg</p>
    <p>Those in the ma­rine and process sec­tors should con­tact swab@edb.gov.sg while those deal­ing with man­u­fac­tur­ing or services work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries can visit www.mom.gov.sg/feed­back</p>
