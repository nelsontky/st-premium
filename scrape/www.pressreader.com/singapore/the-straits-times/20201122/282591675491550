    <p>When Ms Rachel Ma started dab­bling in rub­ber stamp-mak­ing at age 12, she did not ex­pect it to be­come her full-time pro­fes­sion.</p>
    <p>Nor did she ex­pect her name for her first stamp pas­sion pro­ject to fit so well, many years later.</p>
    <p>“I called it Drool Stamps be­cause I wanted some­thing catchy and easy to re­mem­ber, and it stuck,” says the now 24-year-old stamp artist.</p>
    <p>“But since then, a lot of the themes of my stamps re­volve around food, so the name is apt.”</p>
    <p>From a cute egg stamp say­ing “Eg­g­cel­lent!” that teach­ers are fond of buy­ing to stamp on their stu­dents’ home­work, to lim­it­ededi­tion ra­men bowl and gy­oza stamps that are ex­clu­sive to her sub­scribers on crowd­fund­ing mem­bers plat­form Pa­treon, Ms Ma is a one-woman op­er­a­tion who cre­ates “drool­wor­thy” stamps.</p>
    <p>She works out of her fam­ily flat in Toa Payoh where her room has be­come a stu­dio work space and ware­house all rolled into one.</p>
    <p>Stamps on her on­line shop, www.drool­stamps.com, start at $10.</p>
    <p>She also does cus­tom jobs. For in­stance, a cus­tomised rub­ber stamp for cou­ples costs be­tween $52 and $60. She comes up with an il­lus­tra­tion and de­sign based on the cou­ple’s photo.</p>
    <p>The Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts grad­u­ate says she came across an on­line blog tu­to­rial by a Malaysian on how to make rub­ber stamps when she was in Pri­mary 6.</p>
    <p>“At that time, I didn’t have a rub­ber carv­ing block, so I picked up my eraser and carved a mush­room stamp out of it,” she re­calls.</p>
    <p>Now, she carves far more com­plex de­signs, from cus­tomised lo­gos for small busi­ness own­ers to fam­ily portraits.</p>
    <p>She has also de­vised a dis­tinct way of lay­er­ing stamps of dif­fer­ent sizes to cre­ate a full im­age, with her cur­rent se­ries of carv­ings of Ja­panese su­per­mar­ket items, like KitKat choco­late bars and Meiji choco­late milk.</p>
    <p>Her cus­tomers are usu­ally sta­tionery fans and pre­dom­i­nantly women aged 20 to 35 years old. She feels that they come to her in­stead of buy­ing ready-made stamps be­cause “they’re buy­ing the ex­pe­ri­ence and for the per­sonal touch given to the things I make and the qual­ity that I de­liver”.</p>
    <p>Af­ter more than a decade of teach­ing her­self the craft, Ms Ma reg­is­tered her busi­ness in March this year. She now teaches en­thu­si­asts at work­shops.</p>
    <p>“Some peo­ple may feel that rub­ber stamps are for kids, but my work­shop par­tic­i­pants tell me the process is very ther­a­peu­tic,” she says.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has meant that work­shops are now con­ducted via Zoom and she sends ma­te­ri­als to par­tic­i­pants be­fore­hand.</p>
    <p>But she hopes to re­sume in-per­son, hands-on work­shops soon.</p>
    <p>She feels that the process of giv­ing one’s full at­ten­tion to mak­ing some­thing with one’s hands helps peo­ple “un­learn the fear of mak­ing mis­takes be­cause, as adults, we are just so con­di­tioned not to fail”.</p>
    <p>“In our ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem, it’s a lot about the fi­nal prod­uct and not about the process, and it’s so in­grained in us that we must be per­fect.</p>
    <p>“But in rub­ber stamp-mak­ing, it’s okay to get it wrong,” she says.</p>
    <p>“If you’re not will­ing to risk look­ing stupid, you’re not will­ing to try new things.”</p>
