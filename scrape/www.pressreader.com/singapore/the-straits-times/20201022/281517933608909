    <p>A long­stand­ing direc­tor of City De­vel­op­ments (CDL) has abruptly quit af­ter clash­ing with the prop­erty gi­ant’s board and man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Kwek Leng Peck, the cousin of bil­lion­aire CDL ex­ec­u­tive chair­man Kwek Leng Beng and un­cle of group chief ex­ec­u­tive Sher­man Kwek, has served on the board for more than 30 years.</p>
    <p>CDL an­nounced that Mr Kwek Leng Peck gave no­tice of his res­ig­na­tion with ef­fect from Oct 19.</p>
    <p>Mr Kwek Leng Peck, 64, cited “dis­agree­ments with the board and man­age­ment in re­la­tion to the group’s in­vest­ment in Sin­cere Prop­erty Group and its con­tin­u­ing pro­vi­sion of fi­nan­cial sup­port to Sin­cere” in a let­ter men­tioned by CDL in its Sin­ga­pore Ex­change fil­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He had also noted his reser­va­tions with CDL’s ap­proach in manag­ing Mil­len­nium & Copthorne Ho­tels (M&C).</p>
    <p>M&C is a wholly owned unit of CDL that owns, man­ages and op­er­ates more than 145 ho­tels glob­ally.</p>
    <p>It listed in Lon­don in 1996 and was delisted last Oc­to­ber af­ter a pri­vati­sa­tion ex­er­cise by CDL.</p>
    <p>Mr Kwek Leng Peck could not be reached for fur­ther com­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>CDL said in yes­ter­day’s an­nounce­ment that its to­tal in­vest­ment in Sin­cere, a Chi­nese de­vel­oper, in­cluded a 51 per cent joint ven­ture hold­ing of 4.4 bil­lion yuan (S$897 million), a US$230 million (S$311.5 million) sub­scrip­tion of bonds is­sued by Sin­cere and a work­ing cap­i­tal loan of 650 million yuan.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, CDL pro­vided a liq­uid­ity sup­port un­der­tak­ing to­talling 1.5 bil­lion yuan re­lat­ing to bonds is­sued by Sin­cere that ma­ture next Mon­day and a 1.5 bil­lion yuan cor­po­rate guar­an­tee in re­la­tion to an ex­ter­nal bank loan ob­tained by Sin­cere. These in­vest­ments to­tal $1.9 bil­lion, CDL said.</p>
    <p>“The liq­uid­ity po­si­tion at Sin­cere is chal­leng­ing, be­ing se­verely im­pacted by the Covid-19 pan­demic and prop­erty cool­ing mea­sures which caused fur­ther tight­en­ing of liq­uid­ity for real es­tate com­pa­nies in China, the most re­cent be­ing China’s three red lines,” CDL said.</p>
    <p>These red lines re­fer to thresh­olds on debt that de­vel­op­ers must meet if they want to re­fi­nance.</p>
    <p>“The in­tended as­set di­vest­ment plan for some of Sin­cere’s re­tail, hos­pi­tal­ity, of­fice and busi­ness parks as­sets to lighten its debt load on in­vest­ment prop­er­ties ex­po­sure... and to shore up its res­i­den­tial de­vel­op­ment plans... is now ex­pected to take longer due to the cur­rent cli­mate,” CDL said.</p>
    <p>The board said it is ap­point­ing an ex­ter­nal fi­nan­cial ad­viser to help re­view its Sin­cere in­vest­ment and its im­pact on the group.</p>
    <p>“(This year) has been a dif­fi­cult year for the hos­pi­tal­ity and tourism sec­tor. In the first half of this year, the group’s ho­tel seg­ment recorded a sub­stan­tial pre-tax loss of $208.2 million, which in­cluded $33.9 million of im­pair­ment losses made in view of the pan­demic,” CDL said.</p>
    <p>Mr Sher­man Kwek told a vir­tual brief­ing in Au­gust that af­ter the M&C pri­vati­sa­tion and the in­vest­ment in Sin­cere, CDL was not look­ing to make any “big, sub­stan­tial game-chang­ing ac­qui­si­tions” at the mo­ment, say­ing that “we need to con­serve cash and en­sure that we can ride out the pan­demic”.</p>
    <p>Mr Kwek Leng Peck also sits on the boards of 81 other com­pa­nies. These in­clude Hong Realty (Pri­vate), Hong Leong Hold­ings and Hong Leong In­vest­ment Hold­ings, which are all sub­stan­tial share­hold­ers in CDL.</p>
    <p>CDL shares closed down 55 cents, or 7.2 per cent, to $7.08 yes­ter­day af­ter re­sum­ing trad­ing at around 1.30pm. The com­pany had re­quested a trad­ing halt be­fore the stock mar­ket opened yes­ter­day</p>
