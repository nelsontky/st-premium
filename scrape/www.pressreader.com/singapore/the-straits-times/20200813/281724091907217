    <p>Fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions should con­tinue to iden­tify Sin­ga­pore­ans with high po­ten­tial for lead­er­ship roles and ex­pand the sup­ply of tal­ented lo­cals, the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The call comes a week af­ter the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) said 47 em­ploy­ers were placed on a watch list for pos­si­ble dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices. Most were from the fi­nan­cial and pro­fes­sional ser­vices sec­tors.</p>
    <p>MAS deputy man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Jac­que­line Loh told the SGUnited Fi­nan­cial Sec­tor Jobs and Skills Fair: “We have to re­main open and will con­tinue to wel­come global tal­ent that com­ple­ment our work­force. Em­ploy­ers must, how­ever, hire in a re­spon­si­ble man­ner and com­mit to grow­ing the lo­cal tal­ent pool.”</p>
    <p>The fi­nan­cial sec­tor cre­ated 22,000 jobs from 2015 to the end of last year, with three in four jobs go­ing to lo­cals. The me­dian monthly in­come of lo­cals in the sec­tor last year was $7,600, well above the na­tional me­dian of $4,600.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ment in the sec­tor is also es­ti­mated to have i ncreased by about 1,500 in the first half of this year, with lo­cals con­tin­u­ing to ac­count for about 75 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ms Loh noted that at­tract­ing firms to set up their re­gional or global head­quar­ters here means they will bring a di­ver­sity of tal­ent from their global work­force, which may af­fect the pro­por­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans on the staff.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, an­chor­ing more global and re­gional func­tions here also brings along more growth, good jobs and op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans,” she added.</p>
    <p>“Fur­ther, it opens up pos­si­bil­i­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans to tap the in­ter­na­tional foot­print of these global fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to gain over­seas ex­po­sure, with some tak­ing lead­er­ship po­si­tions over­seas.”</p>
    <p>She added that most em­ploy­ers hire re­spon­si­bly, en­sur­ing that they build up the num­ber of tal­ented lo­cals, even as for­eign­ers are brought in to plug gaps.</p>
    <p>“Build­ing a strong pipe­line of lo­cal tal­ent is key to sup­port­ing and sus­tain­ing a fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion’s long-term build-out in Sin­ga­pore,” Ms Loh said. “It... fa­cil­i­tates their deeper ap­pre­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore and the re­gion’s dy­nam­ics to fa­cil­i­tate bet­ter busi­ness out­comes as well.”</p>
    <p>MAS in­tro­duced an In­ter­na­tional Post­ings scheme in 2013 to place promis­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans in over­seas po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>The scheme was en­hanced this year to pro­vide 90 per cent co-fund­ing of qual­i­fy­ing costs for post­ings to South-east Asia and 70 per cent co-fund­ing to other Asian lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>MAS urged com­pa­nies to en­sure their hir­ing prac­tices com­ply with MOM’s Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work.</p>
    <p>It also called on com­pa­nies to sup­port their work­ers amid the pan­demic and take a longer-term view in in­vest­ing in their ca­pa­bil­i­ties, such as reskilling them for new roles.</p>
    <p>Around 25 lo­cal and for­eign fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions have com­mit­ted to sup­port close to 5,000 em­ploy­ees in reskilling and re­de­ploy­ment, of whom 3,000 have taken the first steps in this process. Of these, 900 have al­ready com­pleted their train­ing and are in new roles.</p>
    <p>“These ef­forts have helped to avoid re­trench­ment of staff who might oth­er­wise be dis­placed, and con­trib­uted to the steady de­cline in re­trench­ments in the fi­nan­cial sec­tor,” Ms Loh said. “How­ever, given the ac­cel­er­ated pace of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, we need to do more, and at scale.”</p>
    <p>This in­cludes ex­per­i­ment­ing with an ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence plat­form with 13 fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to au­to­mate the process of iden­ti­fy­ing jobs and skills so work­ers can reskill and move into suit­able roles.</p>
    <p>About 60 fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions have of­fered about 1,300 SGUnited Trainee­ship po­si­tions to fresh and re­cent grad­u­ates. And around 50 firms have com­mit­ted to hir­ing 900 Sin­ga­pore­ans over the next three years to be groomed for fu­ture lead­er­ship and spe­cial­ist roles un­der struc­tured tal­ent de­vel­op­ment pro­grammes sup­ported by MAS.</p>
