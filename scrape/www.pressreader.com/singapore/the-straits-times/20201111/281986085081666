    <p>The change to the Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion (PSLE) scor­ing sys­tem must come with a sys­temic change in the at­ti­tudes of Sin­ga­pore­ans (New range of en­try scores for sec­ondary school, Nov 7).</p>
    <p>With the ob­jec­tives of re­duc­ing the em­pha­sis on aca­demic re­sults and fo­cus­ing more on in­di­vid­ual per­for­mance, the changes are timely at this in­flec­tion point of the 21st cen­tury.</p>
    <p>Yet I be­lieve these changes are but a means to an end and not an end in it­self.</p>
    <p>Specif­i­cally, stu­dents, par­ents and teach­ers must read these changes as a call to change their at­ti­tude to­wards ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>We must shift the nar­ra­tive in class­rooms and let stu­dents see that the world out­side of aca­demics is big­ger – it is the world our chil­dren must learn to nav­i­gate.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, the change re­minds us that we should al­ways aim to be the best of our­selves.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents must learn that they ex­cel not be­cause they have a higher score than their peers, but rather, be­cause they have given their best. Such learn­ing can oc­cur only in a cli­mate that fo­cuses on in­di­vid­ual im­prove­ment and achieve­ments.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore story also re­minds us of these im­por­tant lessons. From in­de­pen­dence, Sin­ga­pore has ar­rived at each mile­stone not look­ing at other coun­tries. We ar­rived look­ing at how we can do bet­ter. It is this “bet­ter” that has moulded what is now our re­al­ity.</p>
    <p>Ev­i­dently, such an at­ti­tude of per­sonal growth and mat­u­ra­tion has been em­bed­ded in our DNA and is some­thing we must con­tinue to pass on.</p>
    <p>Even with this change to the PSLE scor­ing sys­tem, there re­main many ways for com­pe­ti­tion and an overem­pha­sis on aca­demic re­sults to oc­cur.</p>
    <p>We can al­ways choose to pick up on other el­e­ments in the sys­tem to com­pare our stu­dents with their peers, but do­ing so will negate all the changes made. It will negate the hopes of our ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem. It will re­strict the holis­tic abil­i­ties of our chil­dren.</p>
    <p>There is a limit to how much a sys­tem can change, yet there is po­ten­tial in how much so­ci­ety can change. I hope this po­ten­tial is not wasted.</p>
    <p>A change in at­ti­tude is never easy. It takes time. But this can­not be the ex­cuse for us to fail, or to never try.</p>
    <p>Koon Wei Pheng</p>
    <p>We must shift the nar­ra­tive in class­rooms and let stu­dents see that the world out­side of aca­demics is big­ger – it is the world our chil­dren must learn to nav­i­gate.</p>
