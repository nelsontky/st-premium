    <p>Fam­ily of­fices in Asia and else­where have main­tained their as­set al­lo­ca­tions to ride out the worst ef­fects of the global mar­ket sell-off.</p>
    <p>This stick-to-the-plan ap­proach has re­sulted in around 75 per cent of fam­ily of­fice port­fo­lios meet­ing or even ex­ceed­ing tar­get bench­marks over the five month to May 31, noted a sur­vey by Swiss bank UBS yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The find­ings were based on re­sponses from prin­ci­pals and ex­ec­u­tives in 121 sin­gle-fam­ily of­fices world­wide, with av­er­age to­tal fam­ily wealth of US$1.6 bil­lion (S$2.2 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>Fam­ily of­fices traded de­ci­sively when eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity stopped and mar­ket volatil­ity surged.</p>
    <p>Early this year, they made tac­ti­cal changes to their port­fo­lios due pri­mar­ily to macro-eco­nomic un­cer­tain­ties, the prospect of re­ces­sion, changes in in­ter­est rates and to take prof­its, said the re­port.</p>
    <p>While in­vest­ment strate­gies among Sin­ga­pore fam­i­lies were no dif­fer­ent from their re­gional peers, some from a prop­erty back­ground did in­vest more in the real es­tate in­vest­ment trust (Reit) sec­tor, said Mr Anurag Ma­hesh, co-head of Asia-Pa­cific global fam­ily of­fice group at UBS Global Wealth Man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>“From an in­vest­ment stand­point, Sin­ga­pore is a big eq­uity mar­ket for Reits, so the ac­cess to those in­vest­ments Sin­ga­pore fam­i­lies have is pretty good.”</p>
    <p>UBS es­ti­mates that Sin­ga­pore last year had be­tween 100 and 120 fam­ily of­fices, in­clud­ing those of fam­i­lies from around the world.</p>
    <p>They had an av­er­age of US$467 mil­lion in as­sets un­der man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Ma­hesh said that both the num­ber of fam­ily of­fices and the as­sets un­der man­age­ment would have in­creased since last year, but he did not give fig­ures.</p>
    <p>He noted the move to­wards pro­fes­sional man­age­ment of fam­ily wealth and an “in­cred­i­bly sup­port­ive” reg­u­la­tory frame­work has driven the growth of fam­ily of­fices here.</p>
    <p>He said: “Sin­ga­pore has a very nur­tur­ing ecosys­tem for fam­ily of­fices.</p>
    <p>“They don’t just need ac­cess to fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions, but many times they would like to be close to each other so that they can ex­change ideas, pretty much like the as­set man­age­ment or the hedge fund in­dus­try do in var­i­ous fi­nan­cial cen­tres around the world.”</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Ex­change has 43 Reits with a to­tal mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of $117 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Mr Ma­hesh added that UBS has not fielded inquiries from Hong Kong about mov­ing to Sin­ga­pore, in part be­cause fam­ily of­fices are well di­ver­si­fied across global fi­nan­cial ju­ris­dic­tions.</p>
    <p>“We have not seen any move­ment of fund man­age­ment en­ti­ties across cities at all,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve that as in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial cen­tres, both Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong re­main com­pet­i­tive in their own right and they re­main strong with the sup­port of healthy fun­da­men­tals.”</p>
    <p>The UBS re­port said that fam­i­lies view strate­gic as­set al­lo­ca­tion as the cor­ner­stone of wealth preser­va­tion and ac­cu­mu­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Any al­ter­ations of­ten in­volve not only the ben­e­fi­cial own­ers but also the fam­ily of­fice’s de­ci­sion-mak­ers and even the next-in-line gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The port­fo­lios were broadly di­ver­si­fied, with 35 per cent al­lo­cated to al­ter­na­tive in­vest­ments and the rest in tra­di­tional as­sets, such as eq­ui­ties, fixed in­come and cash.</p>
    <p>Cash al­lo­ca­tions were on the high side, at 13 per cent, sig­nalling the cau­tion of some fam­ily of­fices.</p>
    <p>Fixed-in­come ex­po­sure was low, at 17 per cent, in a world where in­ter­est rates were al­ready close to zero or neg­a­tive in some coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The high­est strate­gic as­set al­lo­ca­tion weight­ing ahead of the cri­sis was in eq­ui­ties, at 29 per cent.</p>
    <p>While around 65 per cent of fam­ily of­fices say that their mid-term view has not changed, most are seek­ing to make tac­ti­cal changes to their port­fo­lios in re­sponse to the macro-eco­nomic and mar­ket shifts due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and t he sub­se­quent global re­ces­sion, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>Eye­ing dis­lo­ca­tions and mar­ket op­por­tu­ni­ties, 45 per cent of re­spon­dents said that they were plan­ning to raise their al­lo­ca­tions in real es­tate.</p>
    <p>A sim­i­lar per­cent­age aim to raise al­lo­ca­tions in de­vel­oped mar­ket eq­ui­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Ma­hesh said that fam­ily of­fices in Asia will con­tinue to fo­cus on their long-term ob­jec­tives of wealth preser­va­tion while keep­ing ag­ile enough to take ad­van­tage of op­por­tu­ni­ties that may arise.</p>
    <p>Over the years, such of­fices have shown a strong pref­er­ence to al­lo­cate their in­vest­ments to pri­vate mar­kets, such as pri­vate eq­uity and di­rect in­vest­ments, as they of­fer greater con­trol, he added.</p>
    <p>“In line with many fam­i­lies’ growth fo­cus, in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy and health­care are the top two pre­ferred sec­tors for their in­vest­ments.”</p>
