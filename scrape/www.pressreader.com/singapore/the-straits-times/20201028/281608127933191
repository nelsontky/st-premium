    <p>Stu­dents will be get­ting the re­sults of na­tional ex­am­i­na­tions on­line and in smaller venues in the light of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The new ar­range­ments were an­nounced by the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) and the Sin­ga­pore Ex­am­i­na­tions and As­sess­ment Board (SEAB) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The ten­ta­tive dates for the re­lease of exam re­sults for the Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion (PSLE), the N lev­els, O lev­els and A lev­els are avail­able on the MOE web­site.</p>
    <p>The ex­act date will be con­firmed about one week be­fore the ac­tual day.</p>
    <p>Can­di­dates can view their re­sults on­line at SEAB’s web­site on the re­spec­tive dates with a sys­tem-gen­er­ated pass­word or with their SingPass.</p>
    <p>MOE said stu­dents can also re­turn to their schools to col­lect their re­sults, as it recog­nises that do­ing so marks an im­por­tant mile­stone.</p>
    <p>Those who wish to col­lect their re­sults in per­son can do so in in­di­vid­ual class­rooms in­stead of large crowded venues, such as school halls.</p>
    <p>They will have to com­ply with safe man­age­ment prac­tices.</p>
    <p>PSLE can­di­dates can be ac­com­pa­nied by a par­ent or a guardian.</p>
    <p>How­ever, par­ents and guardians would need to wait at des­ig­nated com­mon ar­eas in schools and ob­serve safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents who are un­well or on quar­an­tine or­der, stay-home no­tice or leave of ab­sence on the day the re­sults are re­leased should not re­turn to school.</p>
    <p>The phys­i­cal copy of their re­sults can be col­lected from their school at a later date.</p>
    <p>Those who are un­able to do so may ap­point a proxy to col­lect the re­sults, as well as other forms stated on the MOE web­site.</p>
    <p>If they can­not ap­point a proxy, they can con­tact their school for fur­ther as­sis­tance.</p>
