    <p>IT project man­ager Va­lerie Lim, 45, is very re­lieved that Sin­ga­pore is now in phase two of its re­open­ing as her two chil­dren, aged five and 11, are back in school.</p>
    <p>Man­ag­ing her son’s home-based learn­ing pro­gramme and keep­ing her younger daugh­ter oc­cu­pied while at­tempt­ing to keep up the same level of work pro­duc­tiv­ity at home had been noth­ing short of chal­leng­ing.</p>
    <p>She was the pri­mary care­giver for the chil­dren as her hus­band ro­tated be­tween work­ing from home and of­fice.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lim was among the 1,407 re­spon­dents – in­clud­ing 114 front­line work­ers – who com­pleted a re­cent work­place re­silience sur­vey, which found that more of those work­ing from home feel stressed than those work­ing on the front line of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey, con­ducted by the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity Health Sys­tem’s (NUHS) Mind Sci­ence Cen­tre, found that 61 per cent of those work­ing from home re­ported feel­ing stressed, com­pared with 53 per cent of front-lin­ers.</p>
    <p>More peo­ple in the work-fromhome group (51 per cent) also re­ported feel­ing stressed at home, com­pared with the group who are on the front line of the pan­demic (32 per cent).</p>
    <p>And, women are more likely to re­port be­ing stressed at work and at home, com­pared with men.</p>
    <p>A greater pro­por­tion of women (61.3 per cent) re­ported feel­ing stressed at work, rel­a­tive to men (49.7 per cent). It is the same case when it comes to feel­ing stressed at home – 50.2 per cent for women, ver­sus 45.5 per cent for men.</p>
    <p>On a pos­i­tive note, most of the re­spon­dents said they found work man­age­able and gen­er­ally felt well­sup­ported at home and at work.</p>
    <p>A sep­a­rate sur­vey on men­tal health re­silience, that was done con­cur­rently by the NUHS Mind Sci­ence Cen­tre, found that younger peo­ple are more likely to re­port feel­ing anx­ious and to be less men­tally re­silient than those who are older.</p>
    <p>The two sur­veys, con­ducted over May and June, are be­lieved to be the first Covid-19 men­tal health pop­u­la­tion sur­veys in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In each sur­vey, the re­spon­dents, after check­ing off the age group they are in, their gen­der and if they are a front-line worker or work­ing from home, were asked to give their re­sponses to 10 state­ments. For in­stance, for “I feel stressed at work”, they can choose from five re­sponses rang­ing from “strongly dis­agree” to “strongly agree”.</p>
    <p>A com­bined to­tal of 3,256 re­sponses were col­lected from the sur­veys done on com­mu­nity re­source plat­form ia­maccb.sg, NUHS said. In the men­tal re­silience sur­vey, which had 1,849 re­spon­dents, the con­clu­sion was that Sin­ga­pore­ans younger than 45 years are more likely to re­port feel­ing anx­ious than those aged 45 and above. They may also be less men­tally re­silient than the older ones.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey found that the older the re­spon­dents are, the more likely they are to per­ceive them­selves as be­ing men­tally re­silient.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, half of the older re­spon­dents re­ported be­ing able to han­dle un­pleas­ant emo­tions such as sad­ness, fear and anger, rel­a­tive to 40 per cent of the younger re­spon­dents.</p>
    <p>Half of the younger re­spon­dents fre­quently worry that some­thing bad is go­ing to hap­pen to them or their loved ones. In con­trast, 38 per cent of the older re­spon­dents share that con­cern.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey also found that re­tirees and work­ing adults tend to per­ceive them­selves as men­tally re­silient com­pared with non-work­ing adults and stu­dents.</p>
    <p>A higher per­cent­age of re­tirees (55 per cent) and work­ing adults (46 per cent) re­ported be­ing able to han­dle un­pleas­ant emo­tions such as sad­ness, fear and anger, com­pared with non-work­ing adults (31 per cent) and stu­dents (35 per cent).</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, the sur­vey found that stu­dents were more likely to re­port hav­ing anx­ious thoughts and pre­oc­cu­pa­tions than adults and re­tirees.</p>
    <p>Just 15 per cent of re­tirees think about things that they can­not</p>
    <p>The pan­demic of­fers most coun­tries a very unique ‘stress in­oc­u­la­tion’ ex­er­cise. The learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ence is al­most akin to de­vel­op­ing an­ti­bod­ies to an ill­ness... The in­oc­u­la­tion ef­fect will be very pos­i­tive, though the</p>
    <p>’’ level of im­mu­nity will vary.</p>

    <p>change, com­pared with 38 per cent among work­ing adults, 44 per cent among non-work­ing adults and 53 per cent among stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Lastly, men are gen­er­ally more likely to re­port at­tributes of per­ceived men­tal re­silience, such as be­ing able to stay calm in dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tions (47 per cent), com­pared with women (38 per cent).</p>
    <p>IM­PACT ON MEN­TAL HEALTH</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor John Wong Chee Meng, di­rec­tor of the NUHS’ Mind Sci­ence Cen­tre and the lead clin­i­cian in the two sur­veys, said more peo­ple in the work­from-home group feel stressed when try­ing to meet the mul­ti­ple de­mands of their dif­fer­ent roles at home.</p>
    <p>“Many of those who worked from home are in the age group where they have ad­di­tional fam­ily and so­cial roles, such as car­ing for their young chil­dren, or el­derly par­ents at home,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The blur­ring of so­cial and work space could cre­ate ten­sion and con­flicts, a sit­u­a­tion they may not have had to con­tend with pre­vi­ously when work­ing in the of­fice.”</p>
    <p>When it came to more women work­ing from home feel­ing stressed, rel­a­tive to men, Prof Wong said it could be that women tend to take on more re­spon­si­bil­i­ties at home. The added re­spon­si­bil­i­ties when they are work­ing from home cul­mi­nates in a higher level of stress and anx­i­ety, he said.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, the ques­tion is how should so­ci­ety sup­port women such that they can man­age the mul­ti­ple roles, he said. This would en­tail get­ting men to take on more re­spon­si­bil­i­ties at home, he added.</p>
    <p>He said that younger Sin­ga­pore­ans are likely to feel more anx­ious be­cause they have less life ex­pe­ri­ence to lean on. While the young may not worry a lot about get­ting sick from the coro­n­avirus, they are not im­mune to other ef­fects of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>An on­line sur­vey that the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and Devel­op­ment (OECD) con­ducted in April had shown that the big­gest con­cerns of peo­ple aged 15 to 24 are the toll of the pan­demic on their men­tal health, em­ploy­ment prospects and ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Prof Wong said that for younger peo­ple and in gen­eral, the pan­demic is a good ex­er­cise in re­silience build­ing.</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic of­fers most coun­tries a very unique ‘stress in­oc­u­la­tion’ ex­er­cise. The learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ence is al­most akin to de­vel­op­ing an­ti­bod­ies to an ill­ness... The in­oc­u­la­tion ef­fect will be very pos­i­tive, though the level of im­mu­nity will vary,” he said.</p>
