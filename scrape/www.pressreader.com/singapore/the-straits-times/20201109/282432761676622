    <p>Sev­eral weeks ago, I ven­tured a guess that there is a two-thirds chance that Mr Joe Bi­den will win the pres­i­den­tial election. This has come to pass.</p>
    <p>While the Bi­den vic­tory will see a shift in pri­or­i­ties and trig­ger a mar­ket scram­ble to­wards spe­cific sec­tors, stocks and in­vest­ments, the new ad­min­is­tra­tion will not have it easy.</p>
    <p>Although the Democrats have taken the White House, they have lost seats in the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives and there is a tense bat­tle go­ing on for con­trol of the Se­nate. Run-off elec­tions are com­ing up.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent-elect Bi­den in­her­its the worst econ­omy for any in­com­ing leader with un­em­ploy­ment edg­ing to­wards 9 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mean­while Covid-19 numbers con­tinue to soar, with the coun­try see­ing 100,000 new cases a day. Mr Bi­den will also pre­side over a very di­vided coun­try and a Demo­cratic party that has a very broad – and some­times con­flict­ing – agenda.</p>
    <p>Poli­cies pro­mot­ing eco­nomic re­cov­ery and job growth will be front and cen­tre for the new ad­min­is­tra­tion, even as de­feat­ing Covid-19 re­mains a key fo­cus.</p>
    <p>Still, mar­ket in­sid­ers point out there has al­ready been a no­tice­able shift in the mar­kets away from “Trump Trades” and to­wards “Bi­den Bets” over the past week as Wall Street scram­bled to re­jig port­fo­lios.</p>
    <p>While in­cum­bent Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump had never been ex­plicit in his pol­icy pri­or­i­ties, Mr Bi­den has been clearly in favour of higher so­cial spend­ing and sus­tain­abil­ity ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>A Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will also sig­nif­i­cantly in­crease spend­ing on cli­mate change mit­i­ga­tion. This would mean more in­cen­tives for re­new­ables and green en­ergy.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, the oil and tra­di­tional fos­sil fuel sec­tor could face reg­u­la­tory head­winds as the ad­min­is­tra­tion cuts sup­port and rolls out dis­in­cen­tives.</p>
    <p>The new ad­min­is­tra­tion’s pri­or­i­ties are also likely to be tech­nol­ogy-en­hance­ment projects and start-ups, in­clud­ing roll-outs of 5G net­works and in­creased bio­med­i­cal re­search spend­ing.</p>
    <p>In­deed, over the past week, there has been ev­i­dence that in­vestors have al­ready started pil­ing into re­new­ables, in­dus­tri­als and other sec­tors that could ben­e­fit from the Bi­den win.</p>
    <p>On the for­eign front, while the new ad­min­is­tra­tion could be just as tough on China and other per­ceived un­fair­ness in the global trad­ing sys­tem, it is likely to take a more mul­ti­lat­eral, glob­al­ist, con­cil­ia­tory and negotiatio­n-based ap­proach to tack­ling them.</p>
    <p>Back home, Mr Bi­den’s ad­min­is­tra­tion is also likely to spur more in­fra­struc­ture in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>But how this will be fi­nanced is an im­por­tant is­sue. This brings us to fund­ing, or more bluntly put, a po­ten­tial rise in taxes.</p>
    <p>UBS cal­cu­lates that if the ad­min­is­tra­tion raises the cor­po­rate tax rate from 21 per cent now to 28 per cent, it would re­duce S&P 500 earn­ings per share by about 5 per cent. It also projects that higher taxes on in­come, cap­i­tal gains and div­i­dends for the wealthy could dampen “an­i­mal spir­its”.</p>
    <p>“Vir­tu­ally all com­pa­nies will face the prospect of higher cor­po­rate taxes. But bear in mind that tax in­creases could be phased in over time and higher govern­ment spend­ing may ex­ceed the level of tax in­creases,” UBS noted.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a Bi­den win cou­pled with a di­vided Congress (House con­trolled by Democrats; Se­nate con­trolled by Repub­li­cans) may pre­vent him from im­ple­ment­ing his full eco­nomic agenda, in­clud­ing plans to break up big tech com­pa­nies, raise tax rates and tighten reg­u­la­tion in the fi­nan­cial and en­ergy sec­tors.</p>
    <p>All this will be wel­come news for the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den may also not be able to im­ple­ment an ad­di­tional stim­u­lus of as much as US$2.2 tril­lion (S$3 tril­lion) that the Democrats had pro­posed to com­bat the pan­demic. The Repub­li­can-con­trolled Se­nate has pushed back on the size of the pack­age, which may prove a road­block for Mr Bi­den as he tries to cush­ion the United States econ­omy amid a resur­gence of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>On the flip side, the US Fed­eral Re­serve has hinted that it could step in with more ag­gres­sive mea­sures to pro­tect the econ­omy if politi­cians fail to de­liver the req­ui­site fis­cal stim­u­lus.</p>
    <p>“This may help to pro­vide a back­stop for the econ­omy and prove pos­i­tive for risk as­sets like equities and high-yield bonds,” noted Mr Vasu Menon, OCBC Bank’s ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor for in­vest­ment strat­egy.</p>
    <p>While Mr Bi­den may not be able to con­vince Repub­li­cans to ac­cept a big short-term fis­cal stim­u­lus to cush­ion the econ­omy from the pan­demic, he may have bet­ter luck when it comes to big spend­ing on longer-term needs like in­fra­struc­ture, health­care and clean en­ergy.</p>
    <p>As Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam noted in his Face­book post on Satur­day, it is not im­pos­si­ble that Mr Bi­den and the Se­nate lead­er­ship find ways to work to­gether in the na­tional in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>If so, his poli­cies may still prove to be mod­estly re­fla­tion­ary for the US econ­omy. This cou­pled with the dovish Fed, the ris­ing US bud­get deficit and re­duced trade pro­tec­tion­ism to­wards China may all cause the US dol­lar to weaken, while ben­e­fit­ing Asian and emerg­ing mar­ket (EM) cur­ren­cies.</p>
    <p>“This in turn, could also ben­e­fit risk as­sets like equities and high-yield bonds in Asia and EM mar­kets, which typ­i­cally tend to ben­e­fit from US dol­lar weak­ness,” added Mr Menon.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s in­abil­ity to break up big tech com­pa­nies and im­pose tighter reg­u­la­tion on the en­ergy and fi­nan­cial sec­tor could also lift the cloud of un­cer­tainty for these sec­tors. But the fi­nan­cial sec­tor could con­tinue to face head­winds from an ex­tended pe­riod of de­pressed in­ter­est rates.</p>
    <p>How­ever, if Mr Bi­den does a bet­ter job than Mr Trump in con­tain­ing Covid-19, and if a safe vac­cine is found soon, the prospects of a more sus­tain­able eco­nomic re­cov­ery could still ben­e­fit cycli­cal sec­tors and see more money ro­tat­ing from growth stocks to cycli­cal stocks.</p>
    <p>But there is one over­rid­ing fac­tor which could de­ter­mine how things play out over the next two months: the dan­ger that Pres­i­dent Trump may not cede of­fice. If this hap­pens, chaos could reign un­til inau­gu­ra­tion day on Jan 20. And mar­kets will be in tu­mult.</p>
    <p>Also, in­vestors need to be re­al­is­tic about the in­vest­ment re­turns that are achiev­able from here. Mar­kets have al­ready ral­lied sharply since April and many stocks are trad­ing at rich val­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Still, eq­uity mar­kets have gen­er­ally risen dur­ing the first year of a new pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>While much of the ac­tion will play out on Wall Street, Asian mar­kets in gen­eral and the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket in par­tic­u­lar, will take their cue from New York.</p>
