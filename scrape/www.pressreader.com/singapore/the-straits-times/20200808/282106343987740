    <p>About 6,000 lower-in­come house­holds whose pub­lic fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance is end­ing will now have peace of mind, as their sup­port will be au­to­mat­i­cally ex­tended for an­other six months.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment Masagos Zulk­i­fli said in a Facebook post yes­ter­day that his min­istry is au­to­mat­i­cally ex­tend­ing ComCare as­sis­tance for ex­ist­ing ben­e­fi­cia­ries whose aid would have ended be­tween this month and Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>“They would not have to come to our So­cial Ser­vice Of­fice to re­new the as­sis­tance. How­ever, if their cir­cum­stances have changed and they need more help, they can still ap­proach our of­fi­cers,” he added.</p>
    <p>The au­to­matic six-month ex­ten­sion was also done sev­eral months ago for about 6,000 house­holds whose ComCare as­sis­tance ended be­tween May and last month.</p>
    <p>“Some of our ComCare ben­e­fi­cia­ries tell us this ex­ten­sion gives them some peace of mind as they work to up­lift them­selves and their fam­i­lies,” said Mr Masagos.</p>
    <p>“The ef­fects of Covid-19 will still be felt for some time to come. This health and eco­nomic cri­sis has es­pe­cially af­fected the lower-in­come and vul­ner­a­ble mem­bers of our so­ci­ety. But I would like to as­sure Sin­ga­pore­ans that help will con­tinue to be avail­able to them,” he said.</p>
    <p>One ben­e­fi­ciary whose house­hold’s ComCare as­sis­tance was au­to­mat­i­cally ex­tended ear­lier this year is Madam Thanaletch­imi Karap­piah, 57, who lives with her 63-year-old hus­band in a one-room rental flat in Jurong East.</p>
    <p>She said the ex­ten­sion was a re­lief for her fam­ily. She has re­ceived $900 a month un­der the Short-toMedium Term As­sis­tance scheme from Au­gust to Oc­to­ber last year, and since Fe­bru­ary this year.</p>
    <p>Her hus­band, who has di­a­betes and other health is­sues, has not worked since 2016, while Madam Thanaletch­imi has been hav­ing se­vere back pains since last year, re­sult­ing in her hav­ing to stop work as a cleaner last De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>She is med­i­cally cer­ti­fied as un­fit to work till Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Madam Thanaletch­imi said the $900 goes a long way for the cou­ple. She added that they have been re­ceiv­ing free food from Lake­side Fam­ily Ser­vices dur­ing the Covid-19 out­break, which has helped ease the fi­nan­cial bur­den.</p>
    <p>“I also have to spend the money on bus fare when I go to take care of my daugh­ter and grand­daugh­ter, who live in Boon Lay,” she added. Her daugh­ter, 42, is a sin­gle mother to a 16-year-old.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times ear­lier re­ported that amid the coro­n­avirus out­break, more Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents were on gov­ern­ment fi­nan­cial aid in March and April, com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>HELP IS AVAIL­ABLE</p>
    <p>The ef­fects of Covid-19 will still be felt for some time to come. This health and eco­nomic cri­sis has es­pe­cially af­fected the lower-in­come and vul­ner­a­ble mem­bers of our so­ci­ety. But I would like to as­sure Sin­ga­pore­ans that help will con­tinue to be ’’ avail­able to them.</p>
