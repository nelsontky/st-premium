    <p>One of the few win­ners in the coronaviru­s-stricken econ­omy ap­pears to be the tablet.</p>
    <p>Global sales of these por­ta­ble touch­screen de­vices have gone through the roof in re­cent months as Covid-19 lock­down mea­sures force users to switch to work­ing and play­ing at home. In Sin­ga­pore though, sales are ex­pected to fall slightly this year.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket re­search firm Strat­egy An­a­lyt­ics says global tablet ship­ments in­creased by 17 per cent yearon-year in the sec­ond quar­ter of the year to reach 43.3 mil­lion units – its big­gest growth in six years.</p>
    <p>It is quite a re­ver­sal of for­tune for tablets, which have lost ground to smart­phones in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>Mr Eric Smith, di­rec­tor of con­nected com­put­ing de­vices at Strat­egy An­a­lyt­ics, says: “Gam­ing, video stream­ing and group video chat have be­come more pop­u­lar dur­ing lock­downs to cope with lone­li­ness and bore­dom, giv­ing tablets a new chance to com­pete for ca­sual en­ter­tain­ment needs.”</p>
    <p>He adds that the cur­rent crop of tablets fit the bill as a com­puter for work­ing and learn­ing at home, and that en­try-level mod­els are good enough for school work and are cheaper than lap­tops, while high­erend tablets are ca­pa­ble of han­dling work tasks.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say the re­bound i n global tablet sales is likely to per­sist for the rest of the year.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket re­search firm IDC ex­pects world­wide tablet sales to reach about 150 mil­lion units this year, up slightly from 144 mil­lion last year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, un­like many parts of the world, the Covid-19 pan­demic has not led to an in­crease in tablet sales in Sin­ga­pore. In fact, sales are ex­pected to be lower this year at about 257,000 units, down from 292,000 units last year, ac­cord­ing to mar­ket re­search firm Euromon­i­tor In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>It would be a fifth straight year of de­clin­ing tablet sales in Sin­ga­pore, which Mr Ja­son Tjip­tadi, a re­search an­a­lyst at Euromon­i­tor In­ter­na­tional, at­tributes to the trend of larger smart­phone screens – which re­duces the need for a tablet for me­dia con­sump­tion – and a longer re­place­ment cy­cle for tablets.</p>
    <p>Mr Ishan Dutt, an an­a­lyst at mar­ket re­search firm Canalys, also pre­dicts that lo­cal tablet sales will fall this year. The de­mand bump for com­put­ing de­vices from Covid-19 in Sin­ga­pore was “mostly seen in the note­book space, as ser­vice sec­tor em­ploy­ees with greater com­put­ing and se­cu­rity needs tran­si­tioned to work­ing from home”, he says.</p>
    <p>But he adds that the Gov­ern­ment’s re­cent move to en­sure greater ac­cess to com­put­ing de­vices for low-in­come stu­dents could lead to an in­crease in tablet ship­ments through public sec­tor chan­nels.</p>
    <p>A prod­uct man­ager in her late 30s, who wanted to be known only as Ms Pow­ell, has used Apple’s iPad tablet for work, but it was not un­til Sin­ga­pore im­ple­mented cir­cuit breaker mea­sures in April that she saw the need for a per­sonal tablet.</p>
    <p>The lock­down restric­tions led to her watch­ing more home-based work­out videos. “I couldn’t see the move­ments of the work­out videos clearly on my phone,” she says.</p>
    <p>She bought her first tablet, an en­try-level 8-inch model, at a sale ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>BE­COM­ING MORE LIKE LAP­TOPS</p>
    <p>There is a grow­ing trend among man­u­fac­tur­ers to make the tablet more like a full-fledged note­book.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft ar­guably started this trend in 2013 with the Sur­face Pro 3, which was mar­keted as a lap­top re­place­ment de­vice with a 3:2 as­pect ra­tio that suits of­fice tasks, as well as a re­mov­able key­board ac­ces­sory and a sty­lus.</p>
    <p>An­droid-pow­ered tablets, es­pe­cially pre­mium mod­els, have also been adding more lap­top-like fea­tures over the years.</p>
    <p>Sam­sung re­cently en­hanced its DeX desk­top mode – which of­fers users a desk­top com­put­ing ex­pe­ri­ence – for its lat­est Gal­axy Tab S7 tablets, giv­ing the mode wire­less ca­pa­bil­ity such that it can con­nect to a sep­a­rate dis­play with­out a ca­ble. Huawei’s lat­est MatePad tablets fol­low a sim­i­lar for­mula, of­fer­ing key­board and sty­lus ac­ces­sories and a quasi-desk­top mode.</p>
    <p>But the most notable ex­am­ple is last year’s in­tro­duc­tion of the iPadOS mo­bile op­er­at­ing sys­tem for the iPad, which im­proves the tablet’s mul­ti­task­ing abil­ity and adds sup­port for com­puter mice, track­pads and ex­ter­nal USB stor­age drives.</p>
    <p>Mr Bryan Ma, vice-pres­i­dent of client de­vices re­search at IDC, ex­pects tablet mak­ers to con­tinue fo­cus­ing on pro­duc­tiv­ity, such as “im­prov­ing the soft­ware ecosys­tem to fa­cil­i­tate work­flows that pre­vi­ously were con­tained to a PC”.</p>
    <p>Echo­ing this point, Mr Dutt says: “The re­newed in­ter­est in tablets due to the pan­demic will help drive app de­vel­op­ers to­wards the tablet form fac­tor, par­tic­u­larly in the space of col­lab­o­ra­tive work and video con­fer­enc­ing.”</p>
    <p>Look­ing fur­ther ahead, the lines between tablets and lap­tops could be blurred when fold­able dis­plays be­come main­stream, says Mr Smith. He says firms like Dell, HP and Len­ovo are work­ing on var­i­ous types of book-like fold­ing com­put­ing de­vices that come with larger screens than smart­phones. These de­vices would be as handy as a tablet while hav­ing a sim­i­lar screen size as a lap­top.</p>
    <p>“The sty­lus could be­come more im­por­tant in these types of de­vices, which could change our work­flow and re­duce pa­per-based notes and doc­u­ments,” he says.</p>
