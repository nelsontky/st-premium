    <p>SEOUL • With the resur­gence of Covid-19 in Seoul, many dra­mas have been forced to halt pro­duc­tion as ac­tors and staff tested pos­i­tive for the coronaviru­s, or have come in con­tact with peo­ple who have it.</p>
    <p>So far, 10 dra­mas across mul­ti­ple broad­cast sta­tions have halted pro­duc­tion, in­clud­ing The Pen­t­house: War In Life (SBS), The Spies Who Loved Me (MBC), The Moon Ris­ing River, Bos­sam, Snow­drop (JTBC), Joseon Ex­or­cist (SBS TV), Mr. Queen (tvN) and Lovestruck In The City (Kakao TV).</p>
    <p>Some of these dra­mas have yet to air their first episode.</p>
    <p>For dra­mas that are cur­rently air­ing, how­ever, the sit­u­a­tion is even more chal­leng­ing if one of the main ac­tors tests pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, three ac­tors – Um Ki-joon, Park Eun-seok and Bong Tae-gyu – of SBS’ hit drama The Pen­t­house: War I n Life an­nounced sep­a­rately through their agen­cies and so­cial me­dia that they had tested neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>Um, who had had di­rect con­tact with an ex­tra who was di­ag­nosed with Covid-19, said he would quar­an­tine him­self for two weeks.</p>
    <p>The ex­tra, who was di­ag­nosed on Tues­day, ap­peared in only one scene with Um and Park.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor is be­lieved to have been in­fected with the virus from an­other ex­tra in a dif­fer­ent drama who had tested pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Film­ing of The Pen­t­house: War In Life was al­most fin­ished for the first sea­son when the pro­duc­tion team was no­ti­fied of a pos­i­tive Covid-19 test. The drama cap­tured 16 per cent of view­er­ship with its lat­est episode on Tues­day, mak­ing it one of the most pop­u­lar dra­mas this quar­ter.</p>
    <p>With many drama sets lo­cated in close prox­im­ity to one an­other, the in­dus­try re­sponded promptly to the ex­tras’ di­ag­noses with pro­duc­tion staff im­me­di­ately can­celling pro­duc­tion upon be­ing no­ti­fied, and staff and ac­tors un­der­go­ing tests.</p>
    <p>Many broad­cast sta­tions have re­stricted the num­ber of ac­tors present at shoots since Fe­bru­ary and have fol­lowed strict quar­an­tine mea­sures. The norm is also to shoot many episodes in ad­vance in the event of an out­break af­fect­ing the team.</p>
    <p>“We have lots of film­ing that’s al­ready taken place and our film staff are di­vided into two teams so that the chance of us be­ing un­able to air a drama is very low,” said an MBC drama of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>“Al­though it is a dif­fer­ent story if a main ac­tor tests pos­i­tive, there have been no such cases so far.”</p>
