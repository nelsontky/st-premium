    <p>During the cir­cuit breaker, Ms Ce­leste Ho de­cided to turn her best­selling resin ear­rings into can­dles.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old be­hind ac­ces­sories brand An­other Kynd, which she started last Novem­ber, no­ticed that her in­tri­cate ear­rings – con­tain­ing dried flow­ers and sealed with resin – were mov­ing a lit­tle slower than usual.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple weren’t buy­ing jew­ellery during Covid-19 be­cause they weren’t head­ing out,” says the full-time art di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>“We de­cided to cre­ate something they could ac­tu­ally use at home – and also tar­get an au­di­ence which doesn’t buy jew­ellery.”</p>
    <p>She launched A-kyn­dle with her boyfriend, sales en­gi­neer Jasper Tan, 28, in June, re­leas­ing weekly batches of 50 hand­made can­dles.</p>
    <p>The can­dles have a resin and flower base that is fully dried, be­fore soy wax is poured on top.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple, who both have day jobs, spend their week­ends lay­ing the resin and pour­ing can­dles in Ms Ho’s liv­ing room.</p>
    <p>They were turn­ing in a profit by the third month.</p>
    <p>Lately, they have been re­ceiv­ing more in­quiries from beauty and life­style brands to do “self-care col­labs”, says Ms Ho, adding that she has seen many small can­dle brands like hers pop up in this time.</p>
    <p>The shift to­wards work from home this year has been good for can­dles and home scents busi­nesses as con­sumers try to make their liv­ing en­vi­ron­ments more com­fort­able.</p>
    <p>A re­port from tech­nol­ogy research and ad­vi­sory company Tech­navio showed that the global scented can­dles mar­ket was val­ued at US$5.4 bil­lion (S$7.3 bil­lion) last year, and is ex­pected to grow to US$7.22 bil­lion by 2024.</p>
    <p>While sta­tis­tics on the home fra­grance mar­ket in Sin­ga­pore are lack­ing, a check with local and in­ter­na­tional can­dle brands found that de­mand here has been steadily grow­ing.</p>
    <p>Home-grown Hush Can­dle saw a “sharp in­crease in busi­ness” during the pandemic, de­spite losses from its main rev­enue stream of pop-ups, client events and work­shops, says co-founder Nicole Su.</p>
    <p>“When Covid-19 started, our ecom­merce plat­form saw a sev­en­fold in­crease in sales from April to June, as com­pared to the same pe­riod in the pre­vi­ous year.”</p>
    <p>Like­wise, Mr Ja­son Lee of local fra­grance brand Six says de­mand for his home scent­ing range has “soared ex­po­nen­tially”.</p>
    <p>The range in­cludes reed dif­fusers, neb­u­lis­ers and pure es­sen­tial oils, with the neb­u­lis­ers be­ing his best­sellers.</p>
    <p>“Now with work-from-home and safe dis­tanc­ing, peo­ple find it more im­por­tant to scent up spa­ces rather than them­selves,” says Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>He re­cently launched a Ja­panese yuzu-themed col­lec­tion in sup­port of the Sin­ga­pore As­so­ci­a­tion for Men­tal Health (SAMH).</p>
    <p>Ten dol­lars from each prod­uct sold – an EDT per­fume ($66 to $125), pil­low mist ($28), neb­u­liser set ($98) and pure yuzu es­sen­tial oil ($38 to $158) – will be do­nated to the as­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“We have had cus­tomers tell us that our scents helped to soothe ev­ery­one’s mood at home, es­pe­cially when peo­ple are spend­ing more time to­gether at home now,” he adds.</p>
    <p>Global brands, too, re­port sim­i­lar de­mand, with some like Jo Malone Lon­don, Ae­sop and Loewe adding can­dles to their of­fer­ings with un­can­nily good tim­ing.</p>
    <p>Jo Malone Lon­don’s dif­fusers and can­dles have been do­ing “su­per well” this year, with dif­fusers in its sig­na­ture scent English Pear and Freesia be­ing its best-seller during the cir­cuit breaker, said a local rep­re­sen­ta­tive of the brand.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish per­fume brand launched a can­dle col­lec­tion cre­ated spe­cially for the home in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>For Aus­tralian brand Ae­sop, which de­buted its can­dles in Oc­to­ber, the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket showed “dou­ble-digit growth in sales for the Home Care cat­e­gory in the first to third quar­ter, ver­sus last year in the same pe­riod”, said Dr Kate Forbes, Ae­sop’s global di­rec­tor of in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>The trio of Aro­ma­tique Can­dles ($155 each) de­vel­oped in part­ner­ship with French per­fumer Barn­abe Fil­lion was planned in re­sponse to “cus­tomers ask­ing us to de­velop scented can­dles for some time”, she adds.</p>
    <p>Mr Fil­lion says: “Like ev­ery­one else over the last few months, I’ve been pay­ing closer at­ten­tion to my in­door en­vi­ron­ment, and I’ve no­ticed how we re­dis­cov­ered the plea­sure found in ev­ery­day rit­u­als.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple are spend­ing more time in their homes and are per­haps be­com­ing more at­tuned to their sur­round­ings, looking for ways to el­e­vate ev­ery­day liv­ing. Home scents are a way to do that, just like cook­ing or sourc­ing bet­ter prod­ucts.”</p>
    <p>Pub­lic re­la­tions di­rec­tor Wendy Yeow finds her­self burn­ing es­sen­tial oils more of­ten this year – from a few times a week to ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>“Since we are all home more, I burn more anti-mos­quito oils like lemon­grass to pre­vent dengue fever,” says Ms Yeow, 42, who also favours “im­mu­nity boost­ing” es­sen­tial oils like clove, mint, and lemon.</p>
    <p>She also bought can­dles as gifts for friends during t he cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Hush Can­dle fan Amy Briggs, 28, made six or­ders from the brand this year, to sus­tain her daily can­dle-burn­ing.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been burn­ing so many more can­dles than nor­mal this year – es­pe­cially during the cir­cuit breaker when my hus­band and I were home all day,” says the par­ent li­ai­son of­fi­cer of a pre-school.</p>
    <p>“There’s something so com­fort­ing about the glow of a can­dle at night that makes me feel re­laxed.”</p>
    <p>A-kyn­dle’s Ms Ho and Mr Tan have been busy ful­fill­ing can­dle or­ders. They re­lease a new batch ev­ery Wed­nes­day at 8pm and the can­dles, priced at $33.90 each, of­ten sell out by 11pm.</p>
    <p>“When you stay at home more, you need to make the house smell nice so that your men­tal space will be clearer,” Ms Ho says.</p>
    <p>“If the house smells good, nat­u­rally your mood will be bet­ter too.”</p>
