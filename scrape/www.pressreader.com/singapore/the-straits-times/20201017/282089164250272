    <p>“When will YOU win a No­bel Prize?”</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists re­ceive reg­u­lar re­minders of how i mpor­tant this prize is in their rel­a­tives’ (and the pub­lic’s) mind. For many, the No­bel Prize is their idea of sci­ence.</p>
    <p>In­deed th­ese are the most fa­mous awards in medicine, chem­istry and physics.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists also pay at­ten­tion to the No­bel Prizes be­cause we love sci­ence.</p>
    <p>It’s only nat­u­ral to chat and de­bate about the most sig­nif­i­cant re­cent dis­cov­ery in our fields. This re­quires broad per­spec­tive and con­text.</p>
    <p>With only one prize each year, how can a break­through in cancer ther­apy be com­pared with or ranked against a fun­da­men­tal dis­cov­ery about in­fec­tions?</p>
    <p>This must be par­tic­u­larly stress­ful for the group that meets reg­u­larly in Swe­den to de­cide who is to win the most cov­eted prize in sci­ence.</p>
    <p>Last week, the 2020 No­bel Prizes were an­nounced for the dis­cov­ery of the hep­ati­tis C virus (phys­i­ol­ogy or medicine), ad­vanc­ing our un­der­stand­ing of black holes (physics), and a tech­nol­ogy for edit­ing genomes (chem­istry).</p>
    <p>As a sci­en­tist study­ing the genomes or ge­netic make-up of bac­te­ria, I want to pro­vide a broader per­spec­tive on the lat­ter to give some in­sight into where we might fruit­fully in­vest in more re­search.</p>
    <p>Dr Em­manuelle Char­p­en­tier and Dr Jen­nifer Doudna dis­cov­ered one of gene tech­nol­ogy’s sharpest tools: the CRISPR/Cas9 ge­netic scis­sors.</p>
    <p>Us­ing th­ese, re­searchers can change the DNA of an­i­mals, plants and mi­cro-or­gan­isms with ex­tremely high pre­ci­sion, read the state­ment by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, in ex­plain­ing the de­ci­sion to award them the prize.</p>
    <p>“This tech­nol­ogy has had a rev­o­lu­tion­ary im­pact on the life sciences, is con­tribut­ing to new cancer ther­a­pies and may make the dream of cur­ing in­her­ited diseases come true,” it said.</p>
    <p>The two women used a sys­tem called CRISPR (Clus­tered Reg­u­larly In­ter­spaced Short Palin­dromic Re­peats) to edit a genome.</p>
    <p>A genome is the en­tire set of DNA in an or­gan­ism.</p>
    <p>You may re­mem­ber from school that your body is made up of in­di­vid­ual cells; each cell has a nu­cleus, and in­side the nu­cleus is DNA – the “in­struc­tion set for life”. Your DNA is unique – th­ese dif­fer­ences make you unique, spec­i­fy­ing the colour of your eyes and your gen­eral height and weight, among many other traits.</p>
    <p>Cer­tain dif­fer­ences can in­flu­ence your sus­cep­ti­bil­ity to diseases such as di­a­betes, cancer or Alzheimer’s.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est­ingly, we know that DNA dif­fer­ences do in­flu­ence risk for th­ese diseases, but we of­ten don’t know ex­actly what DNA changes are re­spon­si­ble, much less how this takes place.</p>
    <p>But for some diseases, such as sickle cell anaemia, Duchenne mus­cu­lar dys­tro­phy or cystic fibrosis, we know ex­actly what DNA changes cause the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>If we could “edit” th­ese spe­cific changes, we would com­pletely cure the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Genome edit­ing means mak­ing pre­cise changes to the DNA of an or­gan­ism, and it there­fore has the po­ten­tial to cure – not just treat – any dis­ease caused by DNA dif­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>Genome edit­ing, there­fore, has a huge range of ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>The CRISPR sys­tem is a set of mol­e­cules that was orig­i­nally dis­cov­ered in bac­te­ria.</p>
    <p>Why did it win the No­bel prize? One key fea­ture of CRISPR is that it is pro­gram­mable and gen­eral.</p>
    <p>There have been other tech­nolo­gies in the past that could be used to edit genomes, but CRISPR made it dra­mat­i­cally eas­ier be­cause it was the first tech­nol­ogy that could be eas­ily changed to tar­get the sickle cell DNA mu­ta­tion in one ex­per­i­ment, and then the cystic fibrosis mu­ta­tion, with just a mi­nor change, in the next ex­per­i­ment.</p>
    <p>This pro­gramma­bil­ity made it ap­pli­ca­ble to any genome edit we could ever want to make.</p>
    <p>But though im­por­tant, pro­gramma­bil­ity was not quite enough.</p>
    <p>What made CRISPR a front run­ner in No­bel Prize dis­cus­sions in cafes across the world (or, more pre­cisely, cafes across the street from re­search labs across the world) was that it was also a rel­a­tively small, in­de­pen­dently func­tion­ing pro­tein ma­chine.</p>
    <p>In other words, we could take just the CRISPR com­po­nents, and they would work the same way in nearly any cell type – a heart cell, nerve cell, im­mune cell or even an in­sect cell, yeast cell or bac­te­rial cell.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem re­quires only a few com­po­nents, then it per­forms its func­tion in nearly any cell we put it in – it’s a self-suf­fi­cient, all-in-one mod­ule.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est­ingly, the CRISPR sys­tem was ex­tracted from bac­te­ria, where it was used as a sort of im­mune sys­tem. In bac­te­ria, the CRISPR sys­tem seems to have evolved to be self-con­tained, so that it could be trans­ferred to other bac­te­ria and still func­tion prop­erly.</p>
    <p>Th­ese two fea­tures – pro­gramma­bil­ity and mod­u­lar­ity – are two ad­van­tages that CRISPR im­proved on, com­pared with other genome edit­ing tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>This is why it has had such a broad im­pact on bi­ol­ogy, and re­searchers are us­ing CRISPR in nearly ev­ery imag­in­able cell type, to make bet­ter plants for farm­ing, cus­tomised bac­te­ria for biotech­nol­ogy, mod­i­fied mos­qui­toes for vector-borne diseases and fun­da­men­tal re­search to find the DNA changes we’ll later want to edit, to cure diseases.</p>
    <p>Look­ing more broadly, we have seen th­ese key fea­tures in other No­bel Prize-win­ning tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>There is a very strong par­al­lel with re­stric­tion en­zymes (another DNA-cut­ting sys­tem), the dis­cov­ery of which gar­nered a No­bel Prize in 1978.</p>
    <p>A rev­o­lu­tion in bi­ol­ogy has been al­ready wrought by re­stric­tion en­zymes, and sci­en­tists ex­pect CRISPR will her­ald another bi­o­log­i­cal rev­o­lu­tion of sim­i­lar scale.</p>
    <p>The use of re­stric­tion en­zymes al­lowed for re­com­bi­nant DNA en­gi­neer­ing and molec­u­lar cloning.</p>
    <p>In fact, nearly all of molec­u­lar bi­ol­ogy was ad­vanced by the clever ap­pli­ca­tion of re­stric­tion en­zymes.</p>
    <p>Like CRISPR, re­stric­tion en­zymes come from bac­te­ria. They can also be trans­ferred between dif­fer­ent bac­te­ria and still func­tion – they have the prop­erty of self-con­tained mod­u­lar­ity.</p>
    <p>In fact, many of the foun­da­tional tech­nolo­gies that sup­port mod­ern bi­ol­ogy are de­rived from bac­te­ria.</p>
    <p>Many are mo­du­lar – this seems to be some­thing that evo­lu­tion par­tic­u­larly selects for in bac­te­ria, per­haps be­cause they can eas­ily trans­fer DNA among them­selves.</p>
    <p>Mod­u­lar­ity, in turn, makes th­ese bac­te­rial sys­tems highly ef­fi­cient and eas­ily ex­tracted, so that we can use them for our own pur­poses in test tubes and in other cells – whether bac­te­rial, plant or hu­man.</p>
    <p>Other ex­am­ples of bac­te­rial-re­lated No­bel Prizes are: strep­to­mycin as a treat­ment for tu­ber­cu­lo­sis (1953); trans­fer of DNA between bac­te­ria (1958); the pro­tein that copies DNA (a poly­merase) (1959); the de­tails of how cells re­spond to chang­ing con­di­tions (1965); ap­pli­ca­tion of DNA poly­merases in poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (1993); and bac­te­rial phages for di­rected evo­lu­tion (2018).</p>
    <p>Bac­te­ria are an enor­mously di­verse group of or­gan­isms; what we call a sin­gle species of bac­te­ria has in­di­vid­u­als that are more dif­fer­ent than hu­mans are from chim­panzees.</p>
    <p>There­fore, bac­te­rial re­search is amaz­ingly rich – which is why it has contribute­d so much to all of bi­ol­ogy, a tiny frac­tion of which is recog­nised by No­bel Prizes.</p>
    <p>The di­ver­sity of bac­te­ria means that, for nearly any process or func­tion we might need – be it copy­ing DNA or edit­ing the genome – there is likely some bac­te­ria that has highly op­ti­mised that process.</p>
    <p>Bac­te­ria are, in fact, the Olympic ath­letes of any bi­o­log­i­cal process.</p>
    <p>The fact that many bac­te­ria can ex­change DNA also means that many of their molec­u­lar ma­chines are self-con­tained and mo­du­lar, and we can rea­son­ably ex­pect them to still work when iso­lated or trans­planted, al­low­ing us to re­pur­pose them for our own ends.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, there is a strong com­mu­nity of peo­ple work­ing on bac­te­ria and their molec­u­lar sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Some are work­ing down­stream on op­ti­mi­sa­tion and ap­pli­ca­tion of CRISPR.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers, like my lab, are do­ing more foun­da­tional work, the dis­cov­ery sci­ence that comes be­fore th­ese prizes: un­der­stand­ing the process of DNA trans­fer, char­ac­ter­is­ing the di­ver­sity of bac­te­ria and delv­ing into the de­tails of how th­ese bac­te­rial ma­chines work.</p>
    <p>There is also a com­mu­nity of bac­te­ri­ol­o­gists (called the Bac­te­rial Ul­tra Group, or BUG) look­ing di­rectly at the de­tails for how bac­te­ria cause dis­ease, the di­rect in­ter­ac­tion in­ter­face between bac­te­ria and hu­mans.</p>
    <p>Bac­te­ria are end­lessly fas­ci­nat­ing, and we have much more to learn from them.</p>
    <p>More No­bel Prize-wor­thy dis­cov­er­ies and tech­nolo­gies are cer­tainly lying in wait for us within th­ese di­verse or­gan­isms.</p>
    <p>Pro­gramma­bil­ity and mod­u­lar­ity – th­ese are two ad­van­tages that CRISPR im­proved on, com­pared with other genome edit­ing tech­nolo­gies. This is why it has had such a broad im­pact on bi­ol­ogy, and re­searchers are us­ing CRISPR in nearly ev­ery imag­in­able cell type, to make bet­ter plants for farm­ing, cus­tomised bac­te­ria for biotech­nol­ogy, mod­i­fied mos­qui­toes for vector-borne diseases and fun­da­men­tal re­search to find the DNA changes we’ll later want to edit, to cure diseases.</p>
