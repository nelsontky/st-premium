    <p>The pro­ject to re­de­velop the Ma­rina Bay float­ing plat­form into a per­ma­nent space for large-scale na­tional events has been awarded to a con­sul­tant team led by Woha Ar­chi­tects.</p>
    <p>Rede­vel­op­ment work on NS Square, as the space is called, is sched­uled to start in March 2022 and be com­pleted by the end of 2025, said the Min­istry of Na­tional De­vel­op­ment and Min­istry of De­fence in a joint state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Woha was se­lected to act as the prin­ci­pal con­sul­tant fol­low­ing a de­sign con­sul­tancy ten­der held from May last year to July this year.</p>
    <p>It will lead a team to de­velop and im­ple­ment the de­sign for the rede­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>The joint state­ment said: “Cre­at­ing a live­able and peo­ple-cen­tred city for all Sin­ga­pore­ans is a key part of Sin­ga­pore’s long-term ur­ban de­vel­op­ment plans.</p>
    <p>“In this re­gard, the rede­vel­op­ment of The Float @ Ma­rina Bay re­mains a part of these plans to en­hance the vi­brancy of the city cen­tre and to cre­ate pub­lic spaces where the com­mu­nity can come to­gether.”</p>
    <p>Ini­tially built as a tem­po­rary Na­tional Day Pa­rade (NDP) venue while the new Na­tional Sta­dium was un­der con­struc­tion, The Float @ Ma­rina Bay can seat 27,000 spec­ta­tors and has hosted the event nine times since 2007, most re­cently in 2018.</p>
    <p>The plat­form has also been the venue for nu­mer­ous events over the years, such as New Year count­down cel­e­bra­tions, River Hong­bao and ba­sic mil­i­tary train­ing grad­u­a­tion pa­rades.</p>
    <p>It was due to hold two more NDPs – this year’s and the next – be­fore be­ing de­mol­ished, but this year’s NDP will be held at mul­ti­ple lo­ca­tions in­stead due to Covid-19 re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Among the re­quire­ments for this NS Square pro­ject was for the new plat­form to have a seat­ing ca­pac­ity of 30,000 to 35,000.</p>
    <p>Al­though rede­vel­op­ment is planned to start i n 2022, the pro­ject scope and time­line may be ad­justed due to the im­pact of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“More de­tails on the pro­ject will be shared with the pub­lic when ready,” said the state­ment.</p>
    <p>A ten­der eval­u­a­tion panel had as­sessed that Woha’s con­cept de­sign pro­posal, in col­lab­o­ra­tion with de­sign firm Pop­u­lous, best ful­filled the ob­jec­tives of “cre­at­ing an ex­cit­ing and ac­ces­si­ble com­mu­nity space in the heart of the city, and re­sponded ap­pro­pri­ately to the con­text of Ma­rina Bay with a com­pelling vi­sion and nar­ra­tive”, said the two min­istries.</p>
    <p>They added that the de­sign will make use of the site’s wa­ter­front lo­ca­tion to cre­ate a “dis­tinc­tive, fit­for-pur­pose and flex­i­ble” events venue for dif­fer­ent scales and types of events.</p>
    <p>It will have com­mu­nity sports fa­cil­i­ties, such as a swim­ming pool and wa­ter sports cen­tre, as well as a new wa­ter­front prom­e­nade that will im­prove pedes­trian con­nec­tiv­ity in the area, form­ing a loop round Ma­rina Bay.</p>
    <p>There will also be a na­tional ser­vice-themed gallery, with a mix of open and en­closed spaces, to ac­knowl­edge the con­tri­bu­tions of na­tional ser­vice­men. It will show­case sto­ries of ser­vice­men from the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces and Home Team through var­i­ous mul­ti­me­dia plat­forms and hard­ware dis­plays.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong had an­nounced in 2017 that the tem­po­rary float­ing plat­form at Ma­rina Bay would be de­vel­oped into a per­ma­nent space to com­mem­o­rate na­tional ser­vice, as well as to serve as the pri­mary venue for fu­ture NDPs.</p>
    <p>Woha’s found­ing di­rec­tor Wong Mun Summ said of the pro­ject: “Our team is hon­oured with this op­por­tu­nity to re-imag­ine the float­ing plat­form as a per­ma­nent dis­tinc­tive venue at the Ma­rina Bay wa­ter­front.”</p>
