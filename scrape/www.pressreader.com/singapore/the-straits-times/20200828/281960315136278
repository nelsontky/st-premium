    <p>NEW DELHI • China’s Alibaba Group has put on hold plans to in­vest i n In­dian com­pa­nies, two sources aware of the plans told Reuters, amid sour­ing busi­ness re­la­tions and ris­ing po­lit­i­cal ten­sion be­tween the two na­tions af­ter a clash on their Hi­malayan bor­der.</p>
    <p>Alibaba, which has fu­elled the growth of sev­eral In­dian start-ups, will not put in fresh funds to ex­pand its in­vest­ments in the coun­try for at least six months, the sources said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there are no plans to re­duce its stakes or exit in­vest­ments, they added. The sources de­clined to be iden­ti­fied as the talks are pri­vate.</p>
    <p>Alibaba did not re­spond to a re­quest for comment.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese con­glom­er­ate and its af­fil­i­ates Alibaba Cap­i­tal Part­ners and Ant Group have in­vested more than US$2 bil­lion (S$2.7 bil­lion) in In­dian com­pa­nies since 2015 and par­tic­i­pated in fund­ing rounds of at least an­other US$1.8 bil­lion, ac­cord­ing to data from PitchBook, which tracks pri­vate mar­ket fi­nanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Hit­ting the brakes could slow fund-rais­ing plans for some of Alibaba’s in­vestee com­pa­nies in In­dia, which in­clude pay­ments plat­form Paytm, restau­rant ag­gre­ga­tor and food de­liv­ery ser­vice Zo­mato, and e-gro­cer BigBas­ket.</p>
    <p>Ant Group, which is pre­par­ing for an ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO), on Tues­day called out the chal­lenges it faces in In­dia.</p>
    <p>In its IPO fil­ing, Ant said a change in for­eign in­vest­ment rules in In­dia had led to a “fur­ther eval­u­a­tion of the tim­ing” of its ad­di­tional in­vest­ment in Zo­mato.</p>
    <p>It also said it counted Paytm owner One97 Com­mu­ni­ca­tions, in which it has a 30 per cent stake, as an as­so­ci­ate or joint ven­ture part­ner over which it has “sig­nif­i­cant in­flu­ence”.</p>
    <p>In­dia in April put in­vest­ments from China and other bor­der­ing coun­tries un­der greater scru­tiny to pre­vent op­por­tunis­tic takeovers amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>A bor­der clash in June, in which 20 In­dian sol­diers were killed, es­ca­lated ten­sions, and In­dia im­posed stricter curbs on Chi­nese goods and busi­nesses amid calls for boy­cotts.</p>
    <p>“Alibaba and a few oth­ers have put on hold their In­dia in­vest­ment plans for six months, and they are hop­ing that things would cool off a bit af­ter that,” said one of the sources.</p>
    <p>“No one is plan­ning to put their stakes in In­dian ven­tures on the block, given the mar­ket con­di­tion and the fact that there aren’t many buy­ers,” the per­son said.</p>
    <p>In­dian start-ups are heav­ily funded by Chi­nese in­vestors such as Alibaba and Ten­cent. Bankers have pre­vi­ously said they were look­ing to bol­ster their pres­ence in the coun­try, with an aim to grow their rev­enues out­side China.</p>
    <p>There is a lot of in­ter­est from Euro­pean and United States-based in­vestors to fill the gap left by the Chi­nese, said Mr Ar­jun Sinha, part­ner at In­dian law firm AP & Part­ners.</p>
    <p>“Deal mak­ing, how­ever, may take slightly longer as th­ese will be new re­la­tion­ships as op­posed to fur­ther fund­ing rounds,” said Mr Sinha.</p>
    <p>TikTok chief ex­ec­u­tive Kevin Mayer has left the Chi­ne­se­owned video app firm just three months since join­ing, and only days since the com­pany sued the ad­min­is­tra­tion of US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump over an ex­ec­u­tive or­der ef­fec­tively ban­ning it in the United States.</p>
    <p>He will be re­placed by US gen­eral man­ager Vanessa Pap­pas on an in­terim ba­sis, TikTok said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The res­ig­na­tion comes at a tricky time for fast-grow­ing TikTok as it tries to per­suade both the US and In­dia that it is not a se­cu­rity threat, while hold­ing dis­cus­sions with prospec­tive buy­ers fol­low­ing a sec­ond US or­der de­mand­ing the sale of its US op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Mayer was Walt Dis­ney Co’s top stream­ing ex­ec­u­tive be­fore be­com­ing chief ex­ec­u­tive of TikTok and chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer of par­ent ByteDance on June 1.</p>
    <p>“In re­cent weeks, as the po­lit­i­cal en­vi­ron­ment has sharply changed, I have done sig­nif­i­cant re­flec­tion on what the cor­po­rate struc­tural changes will re­quire, and what it means for the global role I signed up for,” Mr Mayer said, in an let­ter to em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>“Against this back­drop, and as we expect to reach a res­o­lu­tion very soon, it is with a heavy heart that I wanted to let you all know that I have de­cided to leave the com­pany.”</p>
    <p>ByteDance founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive Zhang Yim­ing said, in a sep­a­rate let­ter re­viewed by Reuters, that the com­pany was “mov­ing quickly to find res­o­lu­tions to the is­sues that we face glob­ally, par­tic­u­larly in the US and In­dia”.</p>
    <p>He said Mr Mayer had joined just as the com­pany was “en­ter­ing ar­guably our most chal­leng­ing mo­ment”.</p>
    <p>“It is never easy to come into a lead­er­ship po­si­tion in a com­pany mov­ing as quickly as we are, and the cir­cum­stances fol­low­ing his ar­rival made it all the more com­plex,” Mr Zhang said.</p>
    <p>ByteDance em­ploy­ees said they were not sur­prised by Mr Mayer’s de­ci­sion given TikTok’s un­pre­dictable fu­ture, and also be­cause the for­mer Dis­ney ex­ec­u­tive has not had a sig­nif­i­cant role in some im­por­tant de­ci­sions as he was still new to the team.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhang has been the key per­son in TikTok sale talks, said two peo­ple with knowl­edge of the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>But Mr Mayer rep­re­sented TikTok for dis­cus­sions with se­nior ex­ec­u­tives of in­ter­ested buy­ers just days ago, a third per­son said.</p>
    <p>“The learn­ing curve was steep for him, from daily op­er­a­tions to geopo­lit­i­cal im­pli­ca­tions,” said one of the peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Mr Mark Natkin, man­ag­ing direc­tor of Mar­bridge Con­sult­ing in Bei­jing, said: “Whether TikTok reaches an agree­ment to sell its US busi­ness or de­cides to duke it out in the courts, the role for Mayer will not be any­thing like that he had en­vi­sioned when he joined.”</p>
    <p>ByteDance em­ploy­ees said they were not sur­prised by Mr Kevin Mayer’s de­ci­sion given TikTok’s un­pre­dictable fu­ture, and also be­cause the for­mer Dis­ney ex­ec­u­tive has not had a sig­nif­i­cant role in some im­por­tant de­ci­sions as he was still new to the team</p>
