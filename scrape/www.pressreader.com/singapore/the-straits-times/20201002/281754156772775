    <p>Sus­pen­sion of late pay­ment charges on Hous­ing Board (HDB) mort­gage ar­rears will be fur­ther ex­tended to March next year, as Sin­ga­pore­ans con­tinue to grap­ple with the eco­nomic im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Fam­i­lies liv­ing in pub­lic rental flats will also have their rent slashed by half for three months, from this month to De­cem­ber, Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Des­mond Lee an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Late pay­ment charges for these HDB rental house­holds will also con­tinue to be sus­pended un­til the end of next March.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day that these ad­di­tional mea­sures would help HDB home own­ers and ten­ants ride through the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion is likely to re­main dif­fi­cult for some time. Be­cause of this, some house­holds are strug­gling to cope with their hous­ing mort­gage re­pay­ments,” said Mr Lee, who is also the Min­is­ter-in-charge of So­cial Ser­vices In­te­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>HDB first sus­pended late pay­ment charges on mort­gage ar­rears for three months in April, then ex­tended it to Sept 30. This is the sec­ond ex­ten­sion.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent late pay­ment charge is 7.5 per cent per an­num based on the out­stand­ing in­stal­ment amount at the end of the month.</p>
    <p>Be­tween April and Au­gust, about 2,500 house­holds took up fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance mea­sures of­fered by HDB. These in­cluded de­fer­ring loan in­stal­ments and re­duc­ing the loan in­stal­ment amount.</p>
    <p>From Mon­day, those on HDB loans can also ex­tend their re­pay­ment pe­riod up to age 65 if they need long-term ad­just­ments to their cash flow.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said: “We will con­tinue to mon­i­tor the sit­u­a­tion closely and re­view our mea­sures to sup­port house­holds with fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties.”</p>
    <p>Banks and fi­nance com­pa­nies have also been pro­vid­ing relief for those with dif­fi­culty mak­ing loan re­pay­ments. Data from the Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) shows that 34,000 home own­ers have re­quested to stop pay­ing their bank loans and in­ter­est un­til De­cem­ber. Another 2,100 have asked banks to de­fer their ren­o­va­tion and ed­u­ca­tion loans.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said that MAS will soon an­nounce sup­port mea­sures for HDB flat own­ers with bank loans.</p>
    <p>Home own­ers fac­ing fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties are en­cour­aged to con­tact their lo­cal HDB branch for help.</p>
