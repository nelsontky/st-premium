    <p>Mixed mar­tial arts (MMA) fighter Amir Khan showed tremen­dous heart to step into the cage just days af­ter his fa­ther’s death. But he fell short in his light­weight bout with South Korea’s Park Dae-sung at One Cham­pi­onship’s Col­li­sion Course II event broad­cast on Fri­day night.</p>
    <p>A mi r , 2 6 , lost his fa­ther Ta­judeen An­sari just days be­fore his Dec 18 fight. The bout was taped and tele­vised a week later.</p>
    <p>Ta­judeen, 61, was di­ag­nosed with stage four brain can­cer in Au­gust and had been told by doctors he had be­tween three and six months to live.</p>
    <p>Post-fight, Amir said: “I missed his funeral be­cause of fight week, so I just want to show my love to him. I wanted to have a better fight for him, but that’s life, you win and you lose.”</p>
    <p>As part of pro­to­cols in place be­cause of Covid-19, all ath­letes and of­fi­cials in­volved in One Cham­pi­onship’s shows are iso­lated in a ded­i­cated fa­cil­ity on the week of the event, and fol­low strict itin­er­ar­ies.</p>
    <p>Amir has pre­vi­ously de­scribed how Ta­judeen had whole­heart­edly sup­ported his foray into Muay Thai when he was aged 13, which even­tu­ally led him into MMA and sign­ing for One Cham­pi­onship six years ago.</p>
    <p>Ta­judeen had also been in Amir’s cor­ner in ev­ery bout since he started com­pet­ing in com­bat sport.</p>
    <p>At Col­li­sion Course II, Amir ap­proached his fight with Park ag­gres­sively and ar­guably had the better of the strik­ing ex­changes be</p>
    <p>tween the pair, although in the end two of the three judges gave the 27-year-old Park the nod be­cause of his take­downs.</p>
    <p>“It was a close fight and it could have gone ei­ther way,” said Amir.</p>
    <p>“I felt on the ground he didn’t do much but he man­aged to take me down two or three times.</p>
    <p>“On the feet, I was car­ry­ing out my plan but I couldn’t find the fin­ish.”</p>
    <p>In the main event of Col­li­sion Course II, Rus­sia’s Ja­mal Yusupov un­der­lined his chal­lenge for One’s Muay Thai feath­er­weight world cham­pi­onship with a unan­i­mous de­ci­sion win over French-Al­ge­rian fighter Samy Sana.</p>
    <p>Else­where on the card, for­mer One fly­weight world cham­pion Kairat Akhme­tov of Kaza­khstan also scored a unan­i­mous de­ci­sion vic­tory over Kim Dae-hwan of South Korea.</p>
