    <p>Dat­ing in mid­dle-age oc­ca­sion­ally comes to a beastly end. My friend Sherene is in her late 50s, sin­gle, con­tent, yet in an act of brav­ery went on a date ar­ranged on the In­ter­net. It was her first one and there may not be an­other one. He was a nice fel­low, but in an act of ques­tion­able ro­mance sent her pho­to­graphs of cows taken dur­ing a golf round.</p>
    <p>“I’m like, OK,” Sherene grins down the phone line, “this is not my thing.” Not the golf, not the cows, not any­thing else. There was, ab­sent any feud­ing, as much com­mon ground here as the Mon­tagues had with the Ca­pulets. This man just didn’t fully fit, so she flew.</p>
    <p>For the past week, I have been hav­ing ex­tended con­ver­sa­tions with friends on love and sin­gle­dom. It has been re­veal­ing, thought­ful, amus­ing and com­plex and only when you speak to your fel­low tribe do you re­alise you’re not so odd. We’re one clan and yet sep­a­rate, for love has no sin­gle shade and soli­tari­ness has many tex­tures. Re­la­tion­ship is a word with mul­ti­ple meanings, con­tent­ment has no sin­gle def­i­ni­tion, and the door to ro­mance is not equally ajar for ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>And yet all of us, sin­gle, mid­dle-aged, are tied by some­what sim­i­lar threads of fragility and con­vic­tion. We like space more than Neil Arm­strong did, can be more fas­tid­i­ous than a fin­ish­ing school ma­tron and view com­pro­mise as an idea with lim­ited elas­tic­ity. We’ll stretch, but only so far.</p>
    <p>In short, no way am I dat­ing any­one who re­ar­ranges my stack of plates, doesn’t like news­pa­pers and Mick Jag­ger, and can’t fold tow­els with geo­met­ric pre­ci­sion. In­deed, an­other friend An­jali, 61, a ded­i­cated walker, had a blind date be­ing or­gan­ised for her when she in­ter­rupted to ask: “Is he out­doorsy?” No? March­ing or­ders fol­lowed and it re­flected her clar­ity. She wanted a part­ner in sneak­ers, not an­other ne­go­ti­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The four women I spoke to were aged 54 to 61, ei­ther di­vorced or wid­owed, lived in three dif­fer­ent coun­tries, com­prised a jour­nal­ist, an il­lus­tra­tor, an ex­ec­u­tive and a teacher, swore they weren’t lonely and were – some of them at least – about as keen to go on a date as Don­ald Trump is to leave the White House.</p>
    <p>It’s not that love has died and ro­mance has been wiped away with Mag­iClean. It’s just a lower pri­or­ity, a risk, a route down which in­ti­macy might live but also de­spair. “There’s a fear,” says An­jali, “of go­ing fur­ther. Will it break my heart?”</p>
    <p>Again.</p>
    <p>When you’re young, you’re build­ing some­thing as a duet, a house, a life, a fu­ture, some­thing big­ger, but no longer. Now it’s not about a fam­ily made, but a com­pan­ion­ship found. But it’s a very care­ful ad­ven­ture, for as Shalini, 61, said one af­ter­noon, reach­ing out to an old pal, W.B. Yeats, for help:</p>
    <p>“I have spread my dreams un­der your feet;</p>
    <p>Tread softly be­cause you tread on my dreams.”</p>
    <p>In the fic­tional old days, there was Yente, the match­maker in Fid­dler On The Roof, who in­sisted, “even the worst hus­band, God for­bid, is bet­ter than no hus­band”. Now there is the dat­ing site, love via al­go­rithm, and it works for many but can be a tir­ing tap dance for oth­ers. Imag­ine 50-plus years of sto­ries to tell and places in the past you don’t want to re­turn to. Not to men­tion out-of-date tac­tics. Show­ing re­peated pic­tures of my grand­daugh­ter, I fig­ured, may not quite be the right move.</p>
    <p>Even when a date does hap­pen, you ar­rive at the cof­fee shop partly as an in­ves­ti­ga­tor. A case of Sher­lock meets suitor. Kind­ness is tested for, em­pa­thy is weighed, hu­mour is ex­am­ined. The flir­ta­tion has also be­come an ap­praisal.</p>
    <p>I need a reader as a part­ner be­cause it’s not merely about the si­lence but the ex­changes which fol­low. Words open worlds. But ev­ery­one has a non-ne­go­tiable list of es­sen­tial qual­i­ties. For An­jali the love of fam­ily is para­mount in a com­pan­ion, for Shalini it is re­spect. For Nici, 54, no right-wing bigot should ap­ply, for as she says: “It’s the most im­por­tant is­sue. It’s what I be­lieve in. What’s my legacy to my chil­dren. I have to live what I preach”.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one who be­comes sin­gle knows strug­gle, all of us car­pen­ters try­ing to nail to­gether a new life where so much has changed, like the laws of at­trac­tion and the rules of en­gage­ment. Will you set­tle just be­cause you need se­cu­rity in old age? “Never,” says Shalini.</p>
    <p>It’s not that sin­gle peo­ple don’t want to be pro­tected, but we learn to do it our­selves. We run, we walk, we toughen up, we evolve. Adds Sherene: “We’re con­di­tioned from child­hood to be­lieve that hap­pi­ness lies in a re­la­tion­ship but when we come to this point we re­alise it’s not ab­so­lutely true.”</p>
    <p>Lives can be built for one, lives</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one who be­comes sin­gle knows strug­gle, all of us car­pen­ters try­ing to nail to­gether a new life where so much has changed, like the laws of at­trac­tion and the rules of en­gage­ment. Will you set­tle just be­cause you need se­cu­rity in old age? “Never,” says Shalini.</p>
    <p>neat and or­dered, lives free and an­swer­able to no one, lives of work, plants and friends who indulge our pe­cu­liar­i­ties. “Have your own space,” rec­om­mends Nici, as if she’s writ­ing a how-to book on mod­ern con­tent­ment. “Do your own thing. Be as fussy as you want to be within your own four walls.”</p>
    <p>There’s al­ways room for a part­ner, just not al­ways as a 24-hour, seven-day com­pan­ion. Af­ter years of liv­ing alone, a sec­ond per­son can up­set a care­fully cal­i­brated rhythm. This isn’t idle self­ish­ness but self-preser­va­tion. “In the last seven years,” ex­plains Sherene, “I have strug­gled to build this life.</p>
    <p>I’ve clawed my way up and now it’s too pre­cious to give up. A re­la­tion­ship is a gam­ble and so I err on the side of cau­tion”.</p>
    <p>As peo­ple three-quar­ters through life, we’re a grey­ing mass of truths, con­tra­dic­tions and com­plex­i­ties. We run our lives ably and yet oc­ca­sion­ally wish there was some­one to share the de­ci­sion-mak­ing. We’re con­tent with our days and yet are slightly dam­aged by dis­ap­point­ment. We’re wary of be­ing vul­ner­a­ble and yet to re­late deeply to an­other hu­man re­quires that you re­veal your whole self. The best love lies in sur­ren­der and yet our re­flex has be­come to re­sist.</p>
    <p>For all the com­fort of in­de­pen­dence, there are al­ways small empty spa­ces that a busy life can’t com­pletely fill. So Sherene wishes for a trav­el­ling com­pan­ion. Me for a book-brows­ing pal. An­jali for the warmth of touch. Says Nici: “Some­times I see a cou­ple walk­ing and they put an arm around each other. It makes me feel en­vi­ous.”</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one sin­gle un­der­stands, for ev­ery­one yearns. Then they walk on. Al­ways for­ward.</p>
