    <p>Ber­lin • It’s getting to be a com­mon re­frain each time a re­port sur­faces of right-wing ex­trem­ists in the ranks of Ger­many’s po­lice and mil­i­tary: It’s an un­for­tu­nate but iso­lated case, it does not rep­re­sent the whole branch and, of course, in the fu­ture ev­ery­thing will be closely mon­i­tored.</p>
    <p>This re­sponse, ar­tic­u­lated by min­is­ters and heads of se­cu­rity agen­cies, seemed to work for a while. De­bates about ex­trem­ism within se­cu­rity forces were kept in check and rarely re­sulted in long-last­ing changes.</p>
    <p>Now, how­ever, the time for down­play­ing the prob­lem is over.</p>
    <p>The re­cent rev­e­la­tion from North Rhine-West­phalia, one of Ger­many’s big­gest states, has set off alarm bells. Last week, 29 of its po­lice of­fi­cers were sus­pended af­ter they were found to have shared im­ages of Adolf Hitler and vi­o­lent Nazi pro­pa­ganda in at least five chat groups on the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>The 126 im­ages in­cluded swastikas, a fab­ri­cated pic­ture of a refugee in a gas cham­ber and the shoot­ing of a black man.</p>
    <p>Prior to this case, the Hesse state po­lice chief had re­signed af­ter it emerged that po­lice com­put­ers were used by a mem­ber of the force and his wife to send threat­en­ing mes­sages to eth­nic mi­nor­ity law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>The mes­sages were signed “NSU 2.0”, a ref­er­ence to the Na­tional So­cial­ist Un­der­ground, a neo-Nazi gang re­spon­si­ble for 10 mur­ders be­tween 2000 and 2007.</p>
    <p>In June, De­fence Min­is­ter An­negret Kramp-Kar­ren­bauer or­dered the par­tial dis­so­lu­tion of the elite KSK com­mando force over right-wing ex­trem­ism in its ranks.</p>
    <p>North Rhine-West­phalia In­te­rior Min­is­ter Her­bert Reul said he had long hoped that such episodes were iso­lated ex­cep­tions.</p>
    <p>“To­day, I can no longer speak of in­di­vid­ual cases,” he told a press con­fer­ence last week. He de­scribed the im­ages as “the worst and most re­pul­sive kind of hate-bait­ing”.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral Min­is­ter of the In­te­rior Horst See­hofer also con­demned the ac­tions of the of­fi­cers as a “dis­grace”. Yet it was he who re­sisted ef­forts to in­ves­ti­gate and root out right-wing ten­den­cies within the se­cu­rity forces.</p>
    <p>But the more fresh in­ci­dents come to light, the harder it has be­come to trot out the line that these were iso­lated in­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a study by the news mag­a­zine Der Spiegel, Ger­man states and the fed­eral po­lice force have recorded at least 400 sus­pected in­ci­dents of right-wing ex­trem­ist, racist or anti-Semitic ac­tiv­ity in re­cent years among po­lice of­fi­cers or trainees.</p>
    <p>There have also been more than 30 cases of uni­formed of­fi­cers found to be mem­bers of the so-called Re­ichs­burger move­ment, a group that re­jects the le­git­i­macy of the Fed­eral Repub­lic of Ger­many.</p>
    <p>Al­though many of those ear­lier cases in­volved in­di­vid­u­als, last week’s case in North Rhine-West­phalia stood out for the sheer num­bers implicated in dis­sem­i­nat­ing Nazi pro­pa­ganda and hate speech in one fell swoop.</p>
    <p>With 29 mem­bers, it was prac­ti­cally an en­tire po­lice ser­vice unit that was in­volved. What’s more, even though some among the group were not ac­tive par­tic­i­pants, they turned a blind eye to the ac­tiv­i­ties and failed to re­port them.</p>
    <p>What ac­counts for the rise of right-wing ex­trem­ism in Ger­many’s se­cu­rity forces?</p>
    <p>Ex­perts point to par­tic­u­lar ex­pe­ri­ences that po­lice of­fi­cers of­ten go through. One of them is re­peated en­coun­ters with mi­grants caught for crim­i­nal of­fences, which re­in­force the cops’ pre-ex­ist­ing bi­ases against im­mi­grants.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Ber­lin’s for­mer pro­fes­sor for se­cu­rity man­age­ment Hans-Gerd Jaschke, a sub­stan­tial num­ber of po­lice­men are al­ready pre­dis­posed to suspect mi­grants of crim­i­nal ten­den­cies, never mind that the crime statis­tics show other­wise. For some of­fi­cers, this be­lief gets hard­ened over time into a more rad­i­cal racist and right-wing world­view.</p>
    <p>Given the lack of for­mal struc­tures within the po­lice force to deal with such is­sues, it is not sur­pris­ing that more and more of such in­ci­dents are oc­cur­ring.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem, though, will not be solved by rais­ing the fre­quency and vol­ume of gen­eral con­dem­na­tion against the po­lice and mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>Quite the op­po­site – such crit­i­cism could well en­trench in them the idea that the gov­ern­ment lacks un­der­stand­ing and is un­sup­port­ive, while there is a ready po­lit­i­cal home for them in the right-wing party Al­ter­na­tive for Ger­many (AfD).</p>
    <p>The AfD started life in 2013 as an anti-euro party, but has since evolved into an anti-im­mi­grant party. It waged stri­dent at­tacks against Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel’s open-door pol­icy at the height of the mi­grant cri­sis in 2015.</p>
    <p>Its co-chair­man Alexan­der Gauland talks of bat­tling an “in­va­sion of for­eign­ers” and alien in­flu­ences such as Is­lam.</p>
    <p>For those po­lice­men who be­lieve that most mi­grants are crim­i­nals and should be sent back to their home coun­tries, it seems a no-brainer to join the AfD.</p>
    <p>The party is now not only the big­gest op­po­si­tion party in the Bun­destag with 89 MPs, but also has more po­lice­men as mem­bers and deputies than any other po­lit­i­cal party.</p>
    <p>Given Ger­many’s his­tory, the sit­u­a­tion is ex­tremely sen­si­tive.</p>
    <p>His­to­ri­ans are draw­ing par­al­lels with the past – that af­ter World War I, it was the re­bel­lious se­cu­rity forces of the Weimar Repub­lic that helped to power right-wing par­ties such as Hitler’s Na­tional So­cial­ist Ger­man Work­ers’ Party.</p>
    <p>What’s to be done?</p>
    <p>Politi­cians try­ing to find a so­lu­tion are faced with a dilemma.</p>
    <p>With de­nial no longer an op­tion, they need to openly ad­dress the ris­ing at­trac­tion of right-wing views among the uni­formed forces and say clearly to its mem­bers why these val­ues are un­ac­cept­able.</p>
    <p>And yet, given the lessons of his­tory and present-day re­al­i­ties, they need to do so with suf­fi­cient sub­tlety so as not to alien­ate them.</p>
    <p>Get it wrong and it is likely to drive the po­lice and mil­i­tary even more into the arms of par­ties of the likes of the AfD.</p>
