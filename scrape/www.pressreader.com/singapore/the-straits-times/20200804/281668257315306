    <p>With more peo­ple ex­pected to stream into Sin­ga­pore as bor­ders are grad­u­ally re­opened, the au­thor­i­ties are us­ing tech­nol­ogy to make sure the like­li­hood of them spread­ing Covid-19 to the com­mu­nity is kept to the min­i­mum.</p>
    <p>Key to this are new wear­able mon­i­tor­ing de­vices to en­sure those com­ing into the coun­try stay at home as man­dated by the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>All trav­ellers en­ter­ing here from 11.59pm next Mon­day and serv­ing their stay-home no­tice (SHN) out­side of ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties are re­quired to wear such de­vices, which will alert the au­thor­i­ties if they leave their homes.</p>
    <p>The de­vices re­sem­ble wrist­watches and come equipped with Blue­tooth or GPS tech­nol­ogy, and have to be worn through­out the typ­i­cally 14-day stay-home pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The new mea­sure will af­fect cit­i­zens, per­ma­nent res­i­dents, longterm pass hold­ers, work pass hold­ers and their de­pen­dants. Chil­dren aged 12 and younger are ex­empted.</p>
    <p>In a joint state­ment yes­ter­day, the Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Author­ity (ICA) and the Man­power and Ed­u­ca­tion min­istries said that the de­vices will com­ple­ment ex­ist­ing ways of en­sur­ing SHN rules are ob­served.</p>
    <p>Th­ese i nclude text mes­sages, voice and video calls, and house vis­its by en­force­ment of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers will be is­sued the de­vices at the check­points af­ter clear­ing im­mi­gra­tion. They will then need to ac­ti­vate it and reg­is­ter on a mo­bile app once they reach their place of res­i­dence.</p>
    <p>No­ti­fi­ca­tions may be sent through this app and should be ac­knowl­edged in a timely man­ner, said the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>If the de­vice is not ac­ti­vated, the au­thor­i­ties will con­tact them and pro­vide sup­port or take en­force­ment ac­tion, as needed.</p>
    <p>At­tempts to leave the place of res­i­dence or tam­per with the elec­tronic de­vice will trig­ger an alert to the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>They will then in­ves­ti­gate un­less the per­son is leav­ing his res­i­dence for a Covid-19 test, by ap­point­ment.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the SHN is fully served, the de­vice should be de­ac­ti­vated and thrown away or re­turned, ac­cord­ing to in­struc­tions.</p>
    <p>Those who tam­per with or re­move the de­vice dur­ing the SHN pe­riod can be fined up to $10,000 or jailed for up to six months, or can face both pun­ish­ments. For for­eign­ers, the ICA and the Man­power Min­istry can also re­voke or shorten the va­lid­ity of their work per­mits and work passes.</p>
    <p>No data is stored in the de­vices, and any data, such as lo­ca­tion and per­sonal de­tails, sent to the au­thor­i­ties is pro­tected by end-to-end cer­tifi­cate-based en­cryp­tion.</p>
    <p>Deputy As­sis­tant Com­mis­sioner (DAC) Tan Hoe Koon, deputy di­rec­tor of ICA’s in­tel­li­gence di­vi­sion, said the de­vice will help the SHN regime re­main ef­fec­tive and sus­tain­able as more trav­ellers en­ter the coun­try.</p>
    <p>DAC Tan did not give an es­ti­mate of how many de­vices will be is­sued, but said that ICA mon­i­tored about 40,000 peo­ple on SHN dur­ing the peak pe­riod of late March.</p>
    <p>The new de­vices can ser­vice this num­ber com­fort­ably, he added.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, of­fi­cers con­duct home vis­its about every other day to en­force SHN rules, he said.</p>
    <p>“With the num­ber of peo­ple on SHN go­ing up, we do not have un­lim­ited re­sources to keep up with al­ter­nate-day vis­its,” he told re­porters at a me­dia con­fer­ence at Changi Air­port yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>With the de­vice, of­fi­cers will visit those on SHN once, shortly af­ter they en­ter Sin­ga­pore, and there­after only when there are is­sues or po­ten­tial vi­o­la­tions of rules, he said.</p>
    <p>He added that the au­thor­i­ties, in­clud­ing the Home Team Sci­ence and Tech­nol­ogy Agency (HTX), had been sourc­ing for tech­no­log­i­cal so­lu­tions since as early as April. De­vel­op­ment and test­ing of the wear­able mon­i­tor­ing de­vice started in May.</p>
    <p>De­tails on the cost or man­u­fac­tur­ing of the de­vices are not avail­able, but The Straits Times un­der­stands that they are pro­duced by a third­party com­pany, with mod­i­fi­ca­tions made by ICA and HTX ac­cord­ing to op­er­a­tional re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Asked why the de­vice was not in­tro­duced ear­lier, DAC Tan said: “The mo­ment we re­alised the (pan­demic) is not a short sprint... we be­gan ex­plor­ing a so­lu­tion that could sus­tain us to main­tain this regime for the long term.”</p>
