    <p>I do not think that a li­cens­ing re­quire­ment for cy­clists is the an­swer to safer roads. (Cy­clists, PMD users on roads: Take in­terim steps to boost safety, by Mr Gabriel Ong, Sept 16).</p>
    <p>Case in point: It is not un­com­mon to see driv­ers, all of whom are li­censed and have gone through ex­ten­sive lessons, mov­ing from the third lane to the first with­out sig­nalling in ad­vance.</p>
    <p>Lo­gis­ti­cally, li­cens­ing cy­clists would be near im­pos­si­ble to im­ple­ment and en­force. For ex­am­ple, how big of a li­cence plate would be needed for en­force­ment cam­eras to be able to cap­ture the in­for­ma­tion, and where would such a li­cence plate be placed on a bicycle?</p>
    <p>In pri­vate es­tates, there are chil­dren who cy­cle leisurely on the quiet roads fre­quently. Should they, some as young as five or six years old, be ex­pected to first pass a ba­sic the­ory test?</p>
    <p>Cy­cling is a key so­lu­tion in Sin­ga­pore’s bid to be­come a car-lite na­tion. Any re­quire­ment to li­cense cy­clists would be detri­men­tal to that ob­jec­tive as more peo­ple would be less in­clined to cy­cle, given the has­sle.</p>
    <p>This would then also hurt na­tional ef­forts to lower obe­sity rates, given that cy­cling is a great form of ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>In­stead, per­haps the au­thor­i­ties could work into schools’ phys­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion cur­ricu­lum a yearly les­son on safe cy­cling.</p>
    <p>As for adults, it should be their pre­rog­a­tive to learn about and prac­tise safe cy­cling on the roads, aug­mented by con­tin­u­ing ef­forts by the Safe Cy­cling Task Force. Af­ter all, it is said that road cy­clists have “skin in the game” – many are keenly aware that any ac­ci­dent or mis­take they make on the road will likely re­sult in some form of in­jury.</p>
    <p>As a driver my­self, I think driv­ers should also be aware of cy­clists on the road, and not act ag­gres­sively and dan­ger­ously just be­cause we lose a few sec­onds from hav­ing to slow down or ma­noeu­vre around them. That, to me, is the real key to­wards road safety for all users. Tan Yi Shu</p>
