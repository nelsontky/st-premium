    <p>SAFE SPACE</p>
    <p>As the older child with a brother who is in Pri­mary 2, sec­ondary school student Ayumi Tan does not have an older sib­ling to guide and ad­vise her.</p>
    <p>The Sec­ondary 1 student at West Spring Sec­ondary School rarely has the chance to chat with her hair­dresser mother and her fa­ther, who is a man­ager in the food and bev­er­age sec­tor, as both of them work long hours.</p>
    <p>When she can­not turn to any­one at home for sup­port, Ayumi con­fides in youth men­tor Bong Kai Ning, 30, whom she met at New Life Youth Hub @ Fa­jar in Bukit Pan­jang.</p>
    <p>The hub is op­er­ated by so­cial ser­vice agency New Life Com­mu­nity Services (NLCS).</p>
    <p>Thir­teen-year-old Ayumi was one of nine NLCS ben­e­fi­cia­ries who met Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob dur­ing her com­mu­nity visit to the hub yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing Ms Bong as a sis­ter fig­ure, Ayumi said: “She is kind­hearted and guides me when I am in need of help. She gives me ad­vice on not just school­work but also my re­la­tion­ships with fam­ily and friends. If I have a prob­lem, I know I can reach out to her.”</p>
    <p>The bond be­tween them was un­af­fected dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, when they kept in touch on­line.</p>
    <p>Agen­cies such as NLCS have been grap­pling with an in­flux of cases and are adapt­ing to the chang­ing needs of their ben­e­fi­cia­ries amid the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>A fund­ing re­cip­i­ent of the Pres­i­dent’s Chal­lenge this year, NLCS as­sists its ben­e­fi­cia­ries through var­i­ous services, in­clud­ing fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance scheme Project Love.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic, the agency re­ceived about five cases a month.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the num­ber of cases dou­bled dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, ow­ing to peo­ple fac­ing in­come loss, which par­tic­u­larly af­fected those in the gig econ­omy or in­dus­tries such as tourism or re­tail.</p>
    <p>NLCS ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Felix Wong said: “With the var­i­ous re­lief funds pro­vided by the Gov­ern­ment dur­ing and af­ter the cir­cuit breaker, we saw a slight re­duc­tion in the num­ber of cases, par­tic­u­larly since phase two.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, with re­trench­ment ex­pected as a re­sult of the eco­nomic slow­down, we an­tic­i­pate the num­ber of cases may rise due to un­em­ploy­ment and those af­fected hav­ing de­pleted their sav­ings.”</p>
    <p>De­spite the chal­lenges posed by the pan­demic, Ayumi re­mains op­ti­mistic about the fu­ture. A sports en­thu­si­ast, she as­pires to be a phys­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion teacher and a men­tor.</p>
    <p>She said of the hub: “What we have here is a safe and com­fort­able space where we can make friends and speak freely. I will keep com­ing here as long as I can. This is my sec­ond home.”</p>
    <p>What we have here is a safe and com­fort­able space where we can make friends and speak freely... This is my sec­ond home.</p>
