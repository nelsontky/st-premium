    <p>TAK­ING PRE­CAU­TIONS</p>
    <p>We are con­cerned about the new strain. The pre­lim­i­nary as­sess­ment is that it is 70 per cent more in­fec­tious, which is sig­nif­i­cant, and there­fore we think it is pru­dent to stop all in­com­ing trav­ellers from the UK dur­ing this pe­riod un­til we are able to learn more about this new strain of the virus.</p>
    <p>ED­U­CA­TION MIN­IS­TER LAWRENCE WONG, who co-chairs the multi-min­istry task force com­bat­ing Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has joined more than 40 other coun­tries in tight­en­ing restrictio­ns on trav­ellers ar­riv­ing from the United King­dom, fol­low­ing the emer­gence of a new coro­n­avirus strain there that ap­pears to be more con­ta­gious.</p>
    <p>From 11.59pm tonight, all longterm pass hold­ers and short-term vis­i­tors with travel his­tory to Bri­tain within the last 14 days will not be al­lowed to en­ter or tran­sit through Sin­ga­pore, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This ban will also ap­ply to all those who had ob­tained prior ap­proval for en­try into Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>As for re­turn­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents, they will have to be tested on ar­rival, and again to­wards the end of their 14-day stay-home no­tice pe­riod at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the mul­ti­min­istry task force com­bat­ing</p>
    <p>Covid-19, told re­porters yes­ter­day that Sin­ga­pore has been mon­i­tor­ing the sit­u­a­tion in Bri­tain very closely.</p>
    <p>“The pre­lim­i­nary as­sess­ment is that (the new strain) is 70 per cent more in­fec­tious, which is sig­nif­i­cant, and there­fore we think it is pru­dent to stop all in­com­ing trav­ellers from the UK dur­ing this pe­riod un­til we are able to learn more about this new strain of the virus,” he said.</p>
    <p>While pre­cau­tions are in place, Sin­ga­pore has de­cided to cut ex­po­sure to such ar­rivals.</p>
    <p>“We still need to un­der­stand, be­yond the fact that it is more trans­mis­si­ble, whether it is go­ing to lead to a more se­vere dis­ease, or will there be other im­pact,” he said. “Hav­ing this ad­di­tional pre­cau­tion now is nec­es­sary and pru­dent, be­cause of the un­cer­tainty and the risk.”</p>
    <p>BioNTech chief ex­ec­u­tive Ugur Sahin said his com­pany was con­fi­dent that its vac­cine – co-de­vel­oped with Pfizer – works against the UK vari­ant, but fur­ther stud­ies are needed to be com­pletely sure: “The like­li­hood that our vac­cine works... is rel­a­tively high.”</p>
    <p>But if needed, “we could be able to pro­vide a new vac­cine tech­ni­cally within six weeks”, he added.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, many coun­tries in Europe have stopped flights from Bri­tain. Hong Kong and In­dia have also done so.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion said the new strain was a nor­mal part of a pan­demic’s evo­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said the strain has yet to be de­tected in the Repub­lic, but added that Sin­ga­pore has to stay vig­i­lant and mon­i­tor how the strain is spread­ing, and con­stantly ad­just mea­sures at its bor­ders and within the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>MOH noted that the Bri­tish au­thor­i­ties are in­ves­ti­gat­ing whether the strain is as­so­ci­ated with any change in dis­ease sever­ity, an­ti­body re­sponse or vac­cine ef­fi­cacy. It added that it will eval­u­ate the data as it emerges and re­view bor­der mea­sures ac­cord­ingly.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, short-term trav­ellers hold­ing an air travel pass with travel his­tory to Aus­tralia’s New South Wales state within the last 14 days will not be al­lowed to en­ter Sin­ga­pore from tonight.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents and longterm pass hold­ers with such travel his­tory will be sub­ject to a sev­en­day stay-home no­tice.</p>
    <p>The move fol­lows a new clus­ter of cases in Sydney that led the state to im­pose a five-day lock­down in the North­ern Beaches area, which is slated to end to­day and will be re­viewed by the state.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers from other parts of Aus­tralia will con­tinue to be sub­ject to a Covid-19 test on ar­rival in lieu of a stay-home no­tice.</p>
