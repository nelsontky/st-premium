    <p>TraceTo­gether data will be used with ut­most re­straint, two min­is­ters said yes­ter­day, as they un­der­scored the im­por­tance of main­tain­ing trust in the con­tact-trac­ing sys­tem. Even though the po­lice have the pow­ers to ac­cess the data for crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions, they will do so only for very se­ri­ous of­fences.</p>
    <p>The data col­lected by TraceTo­gether will be used with ut­most re­straint, two min­is­ters said yes­ter­day, as they un­der­scored the im­por­tance of main­tain­ing trust in the con­tact trac­ing sys­tem to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Even though the po­lice have the pow­ers to ac­cess the data for crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions, they will do so only for very se­ri­ous of­fences, such as mur­der, For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakrishn­an and Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam told Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Also, the po­lice can ob­tain the data only di­rectly from the per­son’s phone or the TraceTo­gether to­ken, Dr Balakrishn­an said.</p>
    <p>Their re­marks come af­ter Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs Des­mond Tan af­firmed, in re­sponse to a par­lia­men­tary question, that TraceTo­gether data is not pre­cluded from pro­vi­sions un­der the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code (CPC) that al­low the po­lice to ac­cess data needed in crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>This had sparked crit­i­cism, with some point­ing to re­marks made in June by Dr Balakrishn­an, who over­sees the Smart Na­tion drive, that TraceTo­gether data would be used “purely for con­tact trac­ing, pe­riod”. “Frankly, I had not thought of the CPC, when I spoke ear­lier,” he ad­mit­ted yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He added that he was mind­ful of the trust re­posed in the Gov­ern­ment, adding that the co­op­er­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans and their will­ing­ness to use TraceTo­gether have been key to Sin­ga­pore’s fight against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“The rea­son I asked Speaker’s per­mis­sion to make this clar­i­fi­ca­tion is pre­cisely be­cause of this. If there’s disquiet, if there’s un­cer­tainty, we must answer it, and I must answer it openly, trans­par­ently,” he said.</p>
    <p>Leader of the Op­po­si­tion Pri­tam Singh said it was im­por­tant to clar­ify the is­sue, not­ing it had caused con­ster­na­tion. He and Work­ers’ Party MP Ger­ald Giam (Alju­nied GRC) also said TraceTo­gether should be widely adopted in the in­ter­est of pub­lic health.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing that 78 per cent of peo­ple here have cho­sen to down­load the TraceTo­gether app or col­lect the to­ken, Dr Balakrishn­an said the Gov­ern­ment was con­scious of the need to pro­tect the per­sonal pri­vacy of these users, and had built it into the de­sign of the pro­gram.</p>
    <p>He as­sured Sin­ga­pore­ans that the app col­lects only Blue­tooth prox­im­ity data and not GPS lo­ca­tion data, and said: “The TraceTo­gether app and the to­ken were not de­signed to al­low any gov­ern­ment agency to track the user.”</p>
    <p>But TraceTo­gether data is not ex­empt from the pro­vi­sions un­der Sec­tion 20 of the CPC, said Dr Balakrishn­an, not­ing that it would not be rea­son­able to say that cer­tain classes of data should be “out of reach of the po­lice”, es­pe­cially if they could po­ten­tially give leads on, say, ter­ror­ism ac­tiv­i­ties and save lives. He dis­closed that TraceTo­gether data had been used in a mur­der case.</p>
    <p>If data is not used in such in­stances, it would not sit well with Sin­ga­pore­ans at large, added Mr Shan­mugam. He also said that the po­lice would delete the data if it was no longer needed for use in court or for trial pur­poses.</p>
    <p>Dr Balakrishn­an also said that when the pan­demic is over, the TraceTo­gether pro­gramme would be stood down, and much of the data would be deleted.</p>
    <p>He said the Min­istry of Health may re­tain epi­demi­o­log­i­cal data, but that it should be stripped of iden­ti­fy­ing de­tails.</p>
    <p>He added: “We do not take the trust of Sin­ga­pore­ans lightly. We can­not pre­vail in the bat­tle against Covid-19 if Sin­ga­pore­ans did not trust the pub­lic health au­thor­i­ties, and the Gov­ern­ment of Sin­ga­pore...</p>
    <p>“I want to again as­sure Sin­ga­pore­ans that your con­fi­dence is not mis­placed. We will pro­tect your pri­vacy.”</p>
