    <p>Ac­tor-singer Mo­hamad Aliff Aziz was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to two weeks’ jail and a fine of $500 for theft and an un­re­lated charge of be­hav­ing in a dis­or­derly man­ner in pub­lic.</p>
    <p>The 29-year-old Sin­ga­porean pleaded guilty to the of­fences on Aug 7.</p>
    <p>This was not his first brush with the law. In 2014, he was fined $2,000 for steal­ing two mo­bile phones.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Principal Dis­trict Judge Vic­tor Yeo noted that an In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health (IMH) psy­chi­a­trist had ear­lier found that Aliff had an ad­just­ment dis­or­der.</p>
    <p>The psy­chi­a­trist had, how­ever, stated that it had no bear­ing on</p>
    <p>Aliff’s of­fend­ing be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>Judge Yeo also noted that Aliff was a re­peat of­fender.</p>
    <p>On June 7 last year, Aliff met Indonesian ac­tress Raja Yu­nika Perd­hana Putri, 32, in her room at the Stu­dio M ho­tel in Nan­son Road near Have­lock Road around mid­night to dis­cuss how she could help fur­ther his singing ca­reer in her home coun­try.</p>
    <p>When she went to rest at the sec­ond storey of her room, he opened her hand­bag and stole $300 and one mil­lion ru­piah (S$92) in cash.</p>
    <p>Notic­ing that her money was miss­ing after she woke up about two hours later, she phoned Aliff, who de­nied steal­ing from her.</p>
    <p>She alerted the po­lice later that day. Aliff has since made full resti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Aliff was found to be in­tox­i­cated un­der the link bridge of Orchard Tow­ers shop­ping cen­tre around 5.30am on Nov 10 last year.</p>
    <p>A po­lice of­fi­cer, Sergeant Theodore Lee, 24, who saw Aliff shout­ing loudly, told him to calm down.</p>
    <p>Aliff com­plied be­fore walk­ing away.</p>
    <p>But an hour later, he walked to­wards a nearby taxi and kicked its bumper. No dam­age was caused.</p>
    <p>He also got into a scuf­fle with an ac­quain­tance later that morn­ing near Orchard Tow­ers and was ar­rested.</p>
    <p>Aliff rose to fame in 2007 after win­ning Anugerah, the Malay TV chan­nel Suria’s ver­sion of Sin­ga­pore Idol.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor Pavithra Ramku­mar urged the court to sen­tence him to two weeks’ jail and a fine, stress­ing that he is a re­peat of­fender.</p>
    <p>The de­fence lawyer, Se­nior Coun­sel Mu­rali Pil­lai, said his client had sought treat­ment at var­i­ous places, in­clud­ing IMH, from 2014 to last year.</p>
    <p>Of­fend­ers con­victed of theft can be jailed for up to seven years and fined.</p>
