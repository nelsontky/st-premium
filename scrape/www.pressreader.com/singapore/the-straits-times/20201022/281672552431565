    <p>By the end of De­cem­ber, check­ing in with the TraceTo­gether app or token will be manda­tory at all pub­lic venues in Sin­ga­pore, in­clud­ing restau­rants, work­places, schools and shop­ping malls.</p>
    <p>This was an­nounced by the mul­ti­min­istry task force tack­ling Covid-19 on Tues­day, with TraceTo­gether-only SafeEn­try to be rolled out pro­gres­sively from this month.</p>
    <p>Here is what you need to know about the new re­quire­ment.</p>
    <p>Q What is TraceTo­gether-only SafeEn­try?</p>
    <p>A TraceTo­gether-only SafeEn­try will soon be the only way mem­bers of the pub­lic can check in at a pub­lic venue. They must do so by us­ing the TraceTo­gether app or token.</p>
    <p>There are cur­rently sev­eral other op­tions for check­ing in with SafeEn­try, such as scan­ning the SafeEn­try QR code us­ing your phone cam­era or the SingPass mobile app, or scan­ning the bar codes on your NRIC.</p>
    <p>You will no longer be able to do any of these once Trace To­geth­eronly Safe En­try is im­ple­mented.</p>
    <p>Q How does TraceTo­gether-only SafeEn­try work?</p>
    <p>A The TraceTo­gether app in­cludes a func­tion for users to scan SafeEn­try QR codes that are dis­played at venues.</p>
    <p>The token comes with a QR code that can be scanned for en­try.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses will have to down­load a sep­a­rate SafeEn­try (Busi­ness) scan­ning app on any smart­phone that will al­low them to scan the QR codes on to­kens.</p>
    <p>Q Where will TraceTo­gether-only SafeEn­try be im­ple­mented?</p>
    <p>A It will be im­ple­mented at all pub­lic venues where you cur­rently have to check in with SafeEn­try. These in­clude work­places, schools, places of wor­ships, malls, restau­rants, ho­tels and health­care fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Q When will TraceTo­gether-only SafeEn­try be im­ple­mented?</p>
    <p>A Manda­tory TraceTo­gether check­ins will be in­tro­duced from now un­til the mid­dle of next month at venues where ac­tiv­i­ties in­volv­ing large groups of peo­ple take place.</p>
    <p>Cin­e­mas will be the first places where TraceTo­gether-only SafeEn­try is re­quired, start­ing from next Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Other venues in­clude those where live per­for­mances and busi­ness events are held, as well as places of wor­ship con­duct­ing ser­vices with more than 100 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The rest of the venues na­tion­wide will fol­low suit by end-De­cem­ber, when the dis­tri­bu­tion of TraceTo­gether to­kens has been ex­panded fur­ther and ev­ery­one has ac­cess to ei­ther the app or the token, said Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the task force.</p>
    <p>Q</p>
    <p>Where can I col­lect the TraceTo­gether token?</p>
    <p>A Cur­rently, you can col­lect the token at 38 com­mu­nity cen­tres (CCs) or 13 mobile booths de­ployed at var­i­ous malls. You can go to any of these col­lec­tion points re­gard­less of where you live.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions is on the Token Go Where web­site. By the end of next month, to­kens will be avail­able at all 108 CCs.</p>
    <p>Q Will TraceTo­gether-only SafeEn­try ap­ply to ba­bies or young chil­dren?</p>
    <p>A All Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents aged seven and above will need to use the token or app to check in un­der TraceTo­gether-only SafeEn­try.</p>
