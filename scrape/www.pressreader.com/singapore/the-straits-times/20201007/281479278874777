    <p>The longer our bor­ders re­main closed, the greater the risk of los­ing our sta­tus as an air hub, and our at­trac­tive­ness as a place to in­vest... The sta­tus quo is there­fore not sus­tain­able for us.</p>
    <p>TRANS­PORT MIN­IS­TER ONG YE KUNG, in his speech yes­ter­day on the need to take proac­tive steps to re­vive the Changi air hub.</p>
    <p>The longer Sin­ga­pore’s bor­ders re­main closed, the greater the risk of the coun­try los­ing its sta­tus as an air hub, said Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The sta­tus quo – with Changi Air­port serv­ing just 1.5 per cent of its usual pas­sen­ger vol­ume – is not sus­tain­able, he told Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>“We can­not just wait around for a vac­cine, which may take a year or two be­fore it be­comes widely avail­able. Even then, we do not know if the vac­cine will work as ex­pected,” he said. “So we need to take proac­tive steps to re­vive the Changi air hub, as a top na­tional pri­or­ity.”</p>
    <p>In a 30-minute speech, Mr Ong set out why Sin­ga­pore’s air hub sta­tus is crit­i­cal to its econ­omy, and asked for Sin­ga­pore­ans’ sup­port in this “crit­i­cal en­deav­our” to open up slowly and safely.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s de­ci­sion to close off its bor­ders on March 24 to tourists and short-term vis­i­tors – much like what many gov­ern­ments did around the world in the face of an un­known and dan­ger­ous virus – has dec­i­mated air travel, he said.</p>
    <p>To­day, Sin­ga­pore has fewer pas­sen­gers than when it first opened Changi Air­port Ter­mi­nal 1 in 1981, he noted.</p>
    <p>The clo­sure has af­fected many other sec­tors, such as aero­space, tourism, hos­pi­tal­ity, re­tail, en­ter­tain­ment and at­trac­tions, as well as taxi and pri­vate-hire car driv­ers.</p>
    <p>“But what is most wor­ry­ing is the longer-term im­pact on our en­tire econ­omy. Our avi­a­tion hub sta­tus is es­sen­tial, even ex­is­ten­tial, to the health of the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy, to our jobs and our fu­ture,” said Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>A key rea­son com­pa­nies put sig­nif­i­cant in­vest­ment in Sin­ga­pore is its su­pe­rior air con­nec­tiv­ity, he said. This means cus­tomers, sup­pli­ers, part­ners and key ex­ec­u­tives can travel in and out of the coun­try eas­ily.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong set out the steps that Sin­ga­pore will take to open up its bor­ders and re­vive air travel, to re­build Changi as an air hub. These range from ne­go­ti­at­ing two-way air travel bub­bles with safe coun­tries and re­gions, to the con­tin­ued pur­suit of re­cip­ro­cal green lane ar­range­ments and fa­cil­i­tat­ing pas­sen­ger trans­fers at Changi Air­port.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore should also con­sider lift­ing bor­der re­stric­tions with coun­tries and re­gions that have Covid-19 in­ci­dence rates com­pa­ra­ble with the Re­pub­lic’s and com­pre­hen­sive pub­lic health sur­veil­lance sys­tems, said Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>“Re­mem­ber that we are small. Our do­mes­tic mar­ket is not a big bar­gain­ing chip. In­stead, what we need to have is a mind­set of gen­eros­ity, re­quired of a hub,” he said, adding that this was why Sin­ga­pore opened up its skies uni­lat­er­ally when build­ing up Changi Air­port in the 1980s.</p>
    <p>It is also why Sin­ga­pore re­moved tar­iffs uni­lat­er­ally for all coun­tries decades ago. De­spite this, many coun­tries chose to ne­go­ti­ate air ser­vices and free trade agree­ments with Sin­ga­pore, he said.</p>
    <p>“Our part­ners know that by con­nect­ing to Sin­ga­pore, they con­nect with the rest of the world. They chose to deal with Sin­ga­pore be­cause it is strate­gic to do so.”</p>
    <p>Con­clud­ing, Mr Ong said that while Sin­ga­pore had to close its bor­ders ear­lier this year to keep its peo­ple safe, the trade-off be­tween lives and liveli­hoods is no longer as stark, and the two do not have to be at odds. This is be­cause Sin­ga­pore has learnt to con­trol the virus, and test­ing is now much less of a con­straint.</p>
    <p>“Even­tu­ally, when there is a widely avail­able and ef­fec­tive vac­cine, air travel will re­sume. But in the mean­time, we will have to learn to live with the virus – tak­ing sen­si­ble pre­cau­tions, while earn­ing a liv­ing, and keep­ing hopes for our fu­ture alive.”</p>
    <p>What is at stake is not just hun­dreds of thou­sands of jobs, but Sin­ga­pore’s sta­tus as an air hub, its rel­e­vance to the world, its eco­nomic sur­vival and, in turn, Sin­ga­pore’s abil­ity to de­ter­mine its own fu­ture, he said.</p>
    <p>“We must open up slowly, care­fully, and hold­ing each other ac­count­able for our col­lec­tive safety. But open up we must.”</p>
