    <p>Pres­i­den­tial de­bates are the only op­por­tu­nity for the Amer­i­can public to size up the two can­di­dates face to face.</p>
    <p>The first of three de­bates be­tween United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and his chal­lenger, for­mer vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den, kicks off to­day (to­mor­row morn­ing, Sin­ga­pore time).</p>
    <p>Next week, Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence and Sen­a­tor Ka­mala Har­ris will square off for the only time, with the two pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nees then meet­ing once in each of the fol­low­ing two weeks.</p>
    <p>In an in­creas­ingly splin­tered me­dia land­scape, these de­bates gain greater im­por­tance as they of­fer the coun­try the op­por­tu­nity to watch the same event with­out any par­ti­san fil­ter.</p>
    <p>This pan­demic-era de­bate harkens back to the first live tele­vised pres­i­den­tial de­bate in 1960 in which the two can­di­dates were alone in a stu­dio with a moder­a­tor. There will be much fewer peo­ple in the au­di­ence this time than in the re­cent past.</p>
    <p>In de­scrib­ing how these con­tests are de­signed to func­tion, Mr Mike McCurry, three-time co-chair of the Com­mis­sion on Pres­i­den­tial De­bates, told us: “At the end of the day, the Amer­i­can public gets to watch and judge for them­selves what hap­pens. The de­bate be­longs to the can­di­dates.”</p>
    <p>In the com­ing en­coun­ters, Mr</p>
    <p>Bi­den has the chance to in­deli­bly frame the 2020 pres­i­den­tial cam­paign nar­ra­tive on Mr Trump’s record as pres­i­dent while pro­vid­ing a vi­sion for his pres­i­dency, tip­ping the race from a close call to one squarely in his favour.</p>
    <p>With more than 200,000 Amer­i­cans dead from Covid-19, civil un­rest un­seen since 1968 and the great­est eco­nomic cri­sis to face the coun­try since the Great De­pres­sion, the stakes could not be higher in what will likely be the most watched pres­i­den­tial de­bates in his­tory.</p>
    <p>None of what’s tran­spired this year has trans­formed Mr Trump’s rock-solid po­lit­i­cal stand­ing with his base. His ap­proval rat­ing and core sup­port re­main con­stant from four years ago when he won with just 46.1 per cent of the pop­u­lar vote.</p>
    <p>Right now, the race looks to be de­cided by the same nar­row set of vot­ers, on the same set of is­sues, in the same states that gave Mr Trump his elec­toral col­lege win in 2016.</p>
    <p>One should not ex­pect a 90-minute match-up to turn the tide af­ter four years of sta­sis.</p>
    <p>Maybe, just maybe, how­ever, these de­bates will move the nee­dle.</p>
    <p>LOW EX­PEC­TA­TIONS FOR BOTH CAN­DI­DATES</p>
    <p>The public’s ex­pec­ta­tions for Mr Trump are low head­ing into the de­bate.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple ex­pect him to per­form at the de­bates as he has acted through­out his time in of­fice – crude, men­da­cious and even cruel.</p>
    <p>A ma­jor­ity of the coun­try does not sup­port him.</p>
    <p>If Mr Trump can avoid do­ing any of that, or even just much of it, there’s a chance the me­dia and the public will fo­cus on how he “changed” his tone and then ig­nore his record, which sets him up to claim vic­tory.</p>
    <p>Si­mul­ta­ne­ously, and to Mr Bi­den’s ad­van­tage, the public’s ex­pec­ta­tions for him go­ing into the de­bate are also low, giv­ing him the chance to ex­ceed them.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump broke a car­di­nal rule of pol­i­tics by es­tab­lish­ing those low ex­pec­ta­tions for his op­po­nent.</p>
    <p>The non-stop ref­er­ences to “Sleepy Joe” and “Slow Joe” mean if Mr Bi­den is any­thing but, he will have out­per­formed.</p>
    <p>An en­er­gised Mr Bi­den show­ing up right in front of Mr Trump proves oth­er­wise and all his in­sults blow up right in the Pres­i­dent’s face.</p>
    <p>Now, the Trump cam­paign is des­per­ately back­track­ing on these re­marks.</p>
    <p>“Eight years as vice-pres­i­dent, three decades in the Se­nate, two de­bates as vice-pres­i­dent, and he just came through about a dozen de­bates in the Demo­cratic pri­maries where he van­quished two dozen op­po­nents – that’s the Joe Bi­den we’re ex­pect­ing,” said Mr Tim Mur­taugh, the Trump cam­paign com­mu­ni­ca­tions di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has added a new spin to this – he is now ac­cus­ing Mr Bi­den of tak­ing per­for­mance-en­hanc­ing drugs when he de­bated for­mer pres­i­den­tial hope­ful Bernie San­ders in the Demo­cratic pri­mary and says Mr Bi­den will do the same against him.</p>
    <p>“This guy doesn’t have a clue. He doesn’t know where the hell he is and they’ll give him a shot of some­thing. I don’t know. He’s go­ing to get some­thing,” Mr Trump claimed with­out any foun­da­tion at a rally in Penn­syl­va­nia.</p>
    <p>Go­ing into these de­bates, he con­tin­ued: “We want a drug test. We want a drug test. We’ll both take it. We’ll both take it”.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­den­tial can­di­dates have faced ques­tions about their men­tal fit­ness in the past.</p>
    <p>For­mer pres­i­dent Ron­ald Rea­gan fa­mously ended that cam­paign is­sue for him in a 1984 de­bate when he par­ried the ques­tion of whether he was too old to be pres­i­dent by say­ing: “I will not make age an is­sue of this cam­paign. I am not go­ing to ex­ploit, for po­lit­i­cal pur­poses, my op­po­nent’s youth, and in­ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter that per­for­mance, his poll numbers bounced back and he went on to carry 49 of the 50 states.</p>
    <p>If Mr Bi­den comes out on fire, shows his in­tel­li­gence and po­lit­i­cal acu­men and makes the pos­i­tive af­fir­ma­tive case for his pres­i­dency while show­ing why Mr Trump does not de­serve a sec­ond term, there’s a chance this will be the trig­ger for a Bi­den land­slide.</p>
    <p>CHANCE TO FO­CUS ON COVID-19</p>
    <p>In a typ­i­cal re-elec­tion cam­paign, vic­tory hinges on the first-term record of the Pres­i­dent and whether the public wants to award a sec­ond one.</p>
    <p>All his­tor­i­cal mark­ers point to a Trump de­feat given the state of the union.</p>
    <p>The de­bates give Mr Bi­den his best chance to nail that point home by mak­ing the case both against Mr Trump and for him­self with this sim­ple for­mu­la­tion: “On Covid-19, he failed. I won’t.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den can back up his as­ser­tion with sim­ple vows to al­low sci­en­tists and med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als to call the shots when it comes to the pan­demic re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump will likely do ev­ery­thing he can to pivot away from Covid-19 by blam­ing China and not ac­cept­ing re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Don’t be sur­prised if he even grants him­self an­other A+ for his over­all han­dling of the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Then, he will move back to his 2016 themes, now en­hanced by the threat of race wars. Build the Wall. Cut taxes. Pro­mote law and or­der.</p>
    <p>And, of course, launch per­sonal at­tacks on his op­po­nent.</p>
    <p>But it’s not 2016. Vot­ers like Mr Bi­den more than they did Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton. Covid-19 grips the na­tion. The coun­try be­lieves it’s on the wrong track. Such a tac­tic should not work a sec­ond time.</p>
    <p>THE MODER­A­TOR CAN­NOT SAVE YOU</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den will not have an easy job.</p>
    <p>On the de­bate stage, he must put Mr Trump’s record be­fore vot­ers, make his af­fir­ma­tive case and han­dle the Pres­i­dent one-on-one, all in 90 min­utes. Mr Bi­den has also to avoid fall­ing into the traps his ri­val will set by re­spond­ing to name-call­ing or fact-check­ing ev­ery lie Mr Trump will tell.</p>
    <p>If he low­ers him­self to Mr Trump’s level, these de­bates will change noth­ing.</p>
    <p>In 2016, the Com­mis­sion on Pres­i­den­tial De­bates shifted to a for­mat where there are un­struc­tured 15-minute blocks where can­di­dates could quiz each other on gen­er­ally agreed-to top­ics.</p>
    <p>By de­sign, the moder­a­tor re­mains in the back­ground.</p>
    <p>While the moder­a­tor sets the agenda, he should then fade into the back­ground and leave the can­di­dates to do the heavy lift­ing for each seg­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den and Mr Trump each have their plans, given the for­mat, to take con­trol.</p>
    <p>How the other re­sponds will likely de­ter­mine the win­ner.</p>
    <p>Fox News host Chris Wal­lace di­vides the 90 min­utes into these blocks: Mr Trump’s and Mr Bi­den’s records, the Supreme Court, the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, race and vi­o­lence in cities, elec­tion in­tegrity, and the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>For­eign pol­icy not be­ing one of the blocks shows that this year, the can­di­date’s re­spec­tive for­eign pol­icy po­si­tions will not de­ter­mine how peo­ple vote.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther Mr Bi­den nor Mr Trump will aim their mes­sages at peo­ple watch­ing in Bei­jing, Sin­ga­pore or Tokyo.</p>
    <p>All that mat­ters dur­ing the de­bate are those watch­ing in Beth­le­hem (Penn­syl­va­nia), Krakow (Michi­gan) and Toledo (Ohio), and those are who the can­di­dates will be ad­dress­ing.</p>
    <p>Any non-Amer­i­can watch­ing needs to un­der­stand that this de­bate does not in­di­cate any­thing about the im­por­tance of for­eign pol­icy or which po­si­tions the can­di­dates may take once in of­fice.</p>
    <p>CAN BI­DEN DO IT?</p>
    <p>For the only times from now till elec­tion day on Nov 3, vot­ers will wit­ness Mr Bi­den and Mr Trump pit­ted di­rectly against each other and de­ter­mine whether ei­ther holds up his end of the bar­gain.</p>
    <p>If only one of them does so, the de­bates will take their place in his­tory along­side the first tele­vised pres­i­den­tial de­bates in 1960 be­tween then Sen­a­tor John F. Kennedy and then Vice-Pres­i­dent Richard Nixon, in which Mr Kennedy’s out-per­for­mance of Mr Nixon led to his elec­tion day vic­tory.</p>
    <p>But that’s an aw­ful lot to ask to­day, in a coun­try where each sides’ views are far more en­trenched.</p>
    <p>Among Mr Trump’s core sup­port­ers, three 90-minute de­bates won’t change their fun­da­men­tal sup­port for him, no mat­ter how he does or what he says.</p>
    <p>For Mr Bi­den to be the next pres­i­dent, there must be a shift among the 12.7 mil­lion peo­ple who voted for the Obama-Bi­den ticket but not for Clin­ton-Kaine.</p>
    <p>The de­bates are the per­fect op­por­tu­nity to per­suade them to vote for Bi­den-Har­ris.</p>
    <p>Mak­ing the case ef­fec­tively for his pres­i­dency and against Mr Trump’s record, and the public hold­ing the Pres­i­dent ac­count­able for his per­for­mance, could tip the race from a nail-biter to a Bi­den land­slide.</p>
    <p>His­tory could look back on this de­bate as the cam­paign’s tip­ping point, which ends the Trump pres­i­dency. Or not.</p>
    <p>These de­bates may end up as just an­other mi­cro­cosm of the past four years in which noth­ing changes any­thing when it comes to pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>De­bates are huge. Un­less they do not mat­ter.</p>
