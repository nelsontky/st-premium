    <p>The harm caused by smok­ing and sec­ond-hand smoke is sci­en­tif­i­cally proven.</p>
    <p>Less talked about is obe­sity, an­other ma­jor health is­sue.</p>
    <p>Obe­sity can re­sult from eat­ing too much junk food, which can be ad­dic­tive in the same way as smok­ing. And chil­dren may pick up bad eat­ing habits from their par­ents.</p>
    <p>Fo­rum con­trib­u­tor Lim Teck Koon noted that the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion has said smok­ing is associated with in­creased sever­ity of dis­ease and death in hos­pi­talised Covid-19 pa­tients (Dis­close whether those who died of Covid-19 were smok­ers, Dec 3).</p>
    <p>Obe­sity is also a risk fac­tor. Mr Lim sug­gested that the Min­istry of Health dis­close the smok­ing his­tory of pa­tients who died from Covid-19-re­lated com­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>I sug­gest that the min­istry dis­close whether the pa­tient was a smoker as well as whether the pa­tient was obese. Any such case would serve as a cau­tion­ary tale for obese peo­ple to eat healthily and ex­er­cise reg­u­larly.</p>
