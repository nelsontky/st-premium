    <p>It is said that fi­nan­cial mar­kets of­ten start re­cov­er­ing about five to six months be­fore an eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>That was the case in the af­ter­math of the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome out­break in 2003, and also in mid-2009 as the world be­gan to re­cover from the bruis­ing global fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>So it is rea­son­able to ask if fi­nan­cial mar­kets have been trend­ing higher re­cently in an­tic­i­pa­tion that the worst of the Covid-19 pan­demic may be past us.</p>
    <p>Much of the mar­ket rally world­wide so far has been fu­elled by ag­gres­sive stim­u­lus pack­ages rolled out by cen­tral banks and gov­ern­ments anx­ious to save their col­laps­ing economies.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese fis­cal stim­u­lus is 10 times what it was dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>In the United States, the Fed­eral Re­serve added more than</p>
    <p>US$3 tril­lion (S$4 tril­lion) to its bal­ance sheet this year, grow­ing its as­sets to al­most US$7 tril­lion.</p>
    <p>This huge injection of liq­uid­ity has pushed down the price/liq­uid­ity ra­tio of the US mar­ket to be­low the av­er­age of 0.18 since 1990.</p>
    <p>The Fed has also stepped in with a broad ar­ray of ac­tions to limit the eco­nomic dam­age from the pan­demic, in­clud­ing up to</p>
    <p>US$2.3 tril­lion in lend­ing to sup­port house­holds, em­ploy­ers, fi­nan­cial mar­kets, and state and lo­cal gov­ern­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Kelvin Tay, re­gional chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer at UBS, points out that the de­ci­sion by cen­tral banks around the world to ex­pand their bal­ance sheets has also in­jected huge liq­uid­ity into fi­nan­cial mar­kets.</p>
    <p>“In­deed, with 80 per cent of US cor­po­ra­tions get­ting their funds via bond mar­kets, the de­ci­sion by the world’s big­gest cen­tral bank to pump liq­uid­ity into credit mar­kets was a mas­sive show of sup­port,” he said.</p>
    <p>“By back­stop­ping the shaky credit mar­kets early, cen­tral banks in­ter­vened de­ci­sively to sup­port economies and mar­kets.”</p>
    <p>It is es­ti­mated that some US$4.3 tril­lion of funds is slosh­ing around global money mar­kets – a fig­ure that is some US$700 bil­lion higher than it was in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>This huge flush of liq­uid­ity has also depressed in­ter­est rates and prompted a des­per­ate search for yield, said Mr Vasu Menon, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor for in­vest­ment strat­egy at OCBC Bank.</p>
    <p>“The phe­nom­e­nal power of money has been un­leashed this year,” he said. “Early on, it was to sup­port the bond mar­kets. Now, this money has found its way to riskier as­set classes like equity and higher-yield bonds.”</p>
    <p>Global equity mar­kets have re­gained most of their lost ter­ri­tory for the year, with the main Wall Street in­dexes claw­ing their way to new heights in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>With the tech­nol­ogy sec­tor be­ing the big­gest ben­e­fi­ciary of lock­downs, the tech-heavy Nasdaq in­dex has been pushed to strato­spheric val­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the Straits Times In­dex has re­gained al­most all the ter­ri­tory it lost since the March mar­ket ram­page.</p>
    <p>As the Covid-19 vac­cine roll-out gath­ers pace world­wide, there is in­creas­ing op­ti­mism that a grad­ual re­turn to eco­nomic nor­malcy will un­der­pin more up­side for equities.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay sees a V-shaped eco­nomic and mar­ket re­cov­ery, build­ing up “to a crescendo” in the sec­ond quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>“This down­turn and re­cov­ery are very dif­fer­ent from pre­vi­ous ones,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Pre­vi­ous down­turns were usu­ally caused by things like as­set bub­bles or ris­ing rates. The pre­scrip­tions for re­cov­ery were usu­ally mone­tary and fis­cal fixes.</p>
    <p>“This time, the cause of the re­ces­sion is an un­ex­pected pan­demic. The re­cov­ery will be much faster as it will be driven by mas­sive con­sumer spend­ing re­sult­ing from the open­ing up of economies.”</p>
    <p>Also, his­tor­i­cally, re­cov­er­ies from re­ces­sions have re­sulted in multi-year ral­lies.</p>
    <p>If that is the case, this re­cov­ery could carry over to 2022 and be­yond.</p>
    <p>Given the com­bi­na­tion of low in­ter­est rates and ris­ing mar­kets, the ra­tio­nal choice would be to stay in­vested in the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>But where should one in­vest? Most an­a­lysts point to cycli­cal and re­cov­ery plays in the equity sphere. Many of these would be in sec­tors that were beaten down dur­ing the last 10 months – in­clud­ing in­dus­tri­als, en­ergy, prop­erty, fi­nance and even hos­pi­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>If one were to take a longer-term per­spec­tive, in the mix are even se­lected air­lines like Sin­ga­pore Air­lines, Aus­tralia’s Qan­tas Air­ways and Delta Air Lines in the US.</p>
    <p>Then there is also tech­nol­ogy. “Tech­nol­ogy is here to stay, and the ro­ta­tion into tech will be a long-term trend,” said Mr Menon.</p>
    <p>While big techs like the “Faang” stocks – Face­book, Ama­zon, Ap­ple, Netflix, Google – and oth­ers like Zoom have al­ready ben­e­fited hugely amid the lock­downs, and will con­tinue to ride higher, the next wave could be the sec­ond-lin­ers.</p>
    <p>These would in­clude the semi­con­duc­tor play­ers, the com­po­nent spe­cial­ists, net­work in­te­gra­tors and oth­ers that play “sup­port­ing roles” to the big techs.</p>
    <p>In a re­cent re­port, UBS advised in­vestors to also look at the “next big thing”.</p>
    <p>This would in­clude 5G, ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, au­toma­tion, fin­tech, healthtech and green­tech.</p>
    <p>Sec­tors like solar and wind power and clean en­ergy mo­bil­ity will all come un­der the in­vest­ment spot­light.</p>
    <p>Geo­graph­i­cally, funds are also in­creas­ingly look­ing east to­wards the Asia-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>And for good rea­son.</p>
    <p>“Asia’s econ­omy got hit by the pan­demic, but it’s on the mend and poised for a strong re­bound,” UBS said in its lat­est 2021 out­look re­port.</p>
    <p>“Like GDP, earn­ings growth is set to jump in the year ahead. This should power the re­gion’s equity mar­kets, es­pe­cially sec­tors and re­gions with cycli­cal traits.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, loose mone­tary pol­icy is here to stay for sev­eral more years, even if in­fla­tion goes up. This means in­ter­est rates will re­main very low for a while.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, in­ter­est rates have plunged to their low­est lev­els in decades. The Sin­ga­pore In­ter­bank Of­fered Rate, or Si­bor, is now un­der 0.5 per cent, com­pared with al­most 1.5 per cent over a year ago.</p>
    <p>While low in­ter­est rates are good for busi­nesses and fi­nan­cial mar­kets, they are not good for savers. It can mean lower re­turns on re­tire­ment sav­ings, ed­u­ca­tion funds and even in­ter-gen­er­a­tional trans­fers.</p>
    <p>As the say­ing goes, there are two ways to make money.</p>
    <p>One way is to earn it. The other is by in­vest­ing. If the right picks are made, stocks can de­liver strong and sus­tained re­turns, en­abling re­tirees and in­vestors to re­bal­ance their port­fo­lios.</p>
    <p>This down­turn and re­cov­ery are very dif­fer­ent from pre­vi­ous ones. Pre­vi­ous down­turns were usu­ally caused by things like as­set bub­bles or ris­ing rates. The pre­scrip­tions for re­cov­ery were usu­ally mone­tary and fis­cal fixes. This time, the cause of the re­ces­sion is an un­ex­pected pan­demic. The re­cov­ery will be much faster as it will be driven by mas­sive con­sumer spend­ing re­sult­ing from the open­ing up of economies.</p>
    <p>MR KELVIN TAY, UBS’ re­gional chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer, who sees a V-shaped eco­nomic and mar­ket re­cov­ery build­ing up ‘to a crescendo’ in the sec­ond quar­ter of next year.</p>
