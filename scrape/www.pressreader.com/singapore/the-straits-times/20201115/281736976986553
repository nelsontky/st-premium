    <p>Sin­ga­pore has man­aged to nor­malise crew changes amid the pandemic, even as many coun­tries con­tinue to re­strict the ro­ta­tion of ship crew at their ports.</p>
    <p>It is also work­ing with in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions to ac­cel­er­ate the adop­tion of safe crew-change prac­tices abroad, said the Mar­itime and Port Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MPA).</p>
    <p>Over 54,000 crew changes have taken place here since March 27, when Sin­ga­pore put in place strict do­mes­tic mea­sures such as the clo­sure of bars and cin­e­mas.</p>
    <p>Crew change has been fa­cil­i­tated for sea­far­ers of all na­tion­al­i­ties, from some 3,500 ships of dif­fer­ent flags be­long­ing to over 2,900 com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic is also back to around 75 per cent of its preCovid-19 crew-change rate. Be­tween 500 and 600 crew changes now take place daily, com­pared with 800 be­fore Covid-19 struck.</p>
    <p>“MPA is not aware of any sea­farer or ship cur­rently stranded in Sin­ga­pore aris­ing from the dif­fi­culty in fa­cil­i­tat­ing crew change here,” it told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>MPA has in­tro­duced safe­guards that in­clude telemedici­ne fa­cil­i­ties to as­sess ship crew as “fit to travel” with­out ex­pos­ing doc­tors to on-board risks, and set­ting up a self-con­tained fa­cil­ity at Tan­jong Pa­gar Ter­mi­nal to house ro­tat­ing crew for up to 72 hours, as the re­duced num­ber of flights meant sea­far­ers might not be able to board their ship right away.</p>
    <p>Since the launch of this fa­cil­ity on Sept 1, it has been hous­ing more than 100 crew each day.</p>
    <p>MPA also de­vel­oped a guide­book along­side in­dus­try part­ners de­tail­ing a set of pro­ce­dures to cre­ate a “safe cor­ri­dor” for crew changes, while min­imis­ing risk to pub­lic health in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said Sin­ga­pore’s ex­pe­ri­ence can serve as a ref­er­ence point for other mar­itime coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Mr Toby Stephens, a part­ner at global law firm HFW and spe­cial­is­ing in mar­itime risk man­age­ment, said Sin­ga­pore’s reg­u­lar up­dat­ing of pro­ce­dures has made it the “nat­u­ral place to un­der­take crew changes”, and that its crewchange rate likely places it among the top ports fa­cil­i­tat­ing them.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Mar­itime Or­gan­i­sa­tion has also cir­cu­lated the guide­book to all mem­ber states as a ref­er­ence, and its sec­re­tary-gen­eral Ki­tack Lim hailed the crewchange “safe cor­ri­dor” as a model to ad­dress the crew-change is­sue in other ports.</p>
    <p>As with travel bub­bles and green lane ar­range­ments, ex­perts said the next step to fur­ther nor­malise crew changes would be to es­tab­lish trust be­tween coun­tries, so they can be con­fi­dent that fa­cil­i­tat­ing these changes will not cre­ate new waves of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The vary­ing stan­dards of quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties and the au­then­tic­ity of Covid-19 test re­sults from dif­fer­ent coun­tries have been an is­sue that has cropped up.</p>
    <p>Ship­ping pub­li­ca­tion TradeWinds re­ported that Sin­ga­pore has sus­pended or banned an un­spec­i­fied num­ber of com­pa­nies from car­ry­ing out crew changes since early July, after MPA no­ticed that some test re­sults had ei­ther been al­tered or tampered with.</p>
    <p>This led to cases of sea­far­ers ar­riv­ing here for crew change with Covid-19 symp­toms, and even­tu­ally test­ing pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
    <p>To find so­lu­tions to such con­cerns, Sin­ga­pore has launched a global ini­tia­tive along­side other gov­ern­ments, the ship­ping in­dus­try and unions such as the In­ter­na­tional Trans­port Work­ers’ Fed­er­a­tion (ITF).</p>
    <p>Called the Sin­ga­pore-Ship­ping Tri­par­tite Al­liance Re­silience (SG-Star) Fund, MPA said the ini­tia­tive will fo­cus on white-list­ing safe quar­an­tine and test­ing fa­cil­i­ties in sea­far­ing na­tions, and tri­alling dig­i­tal so­lu­tions – akin to the TraceTo­gether to­ken here.</p>
    <p>Ship­ping news por­tal Splash247 re­ported that one project that is un­der way sees the ITF tak­ing charge of the 14-day iso­la­tion of work­ers, with the use of dig­i­tally signed doc­u­ments to pro­vide trans­parency to work­ers’ quar­an­tine and Covid-19 test­ing to cre­ate a “safe cor­ri­dor” be­tween the Philip­pines and Sin­ga­pore. Tam­per-proof to­kens and blockchain tech­nol­ogy can be part of the con­fi­dence-build­ing mea­sures, it added.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Carl Schou, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer and pres­i­dent of Wil­helm­sen Ship Man­age­ment: “One grow­ing chal­lenge now is to gain com­mit­ment from all stake­hold­ers in the in­dus­try such as ship own­ers, op­er­a­tors and char­ter­ers to share the bur­den of the higher cost as­so­ci­ated with crew change.”</p>
