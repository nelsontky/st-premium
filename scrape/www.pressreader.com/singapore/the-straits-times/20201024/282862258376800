    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Bo­rat is back – and the fic­tional Kazakh jour­nal­ist’s new film spells bad news for Holo­caust de­niers, United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s sup­port­ers and his per­sonal l awyer Rudy Gi­u­liani.</p>
    <p>Bo­rat Sub­se­quent Moviefilm, out yes­ter­day on Ama­zon Prime, is the se­quel to Bri­tish co­me­dian Sacha Baron Co­hen’s 2006 smash hit mock­u­men­tary Bo­rat, which grossed US$260 mil­lion, earned an Os­car nom­i­na­tion and spawned end­less poorly punc­tu­ated catch­phrases.</p>
    <p>While the plot was un­der wraps, word of Baron Co­hen’s lat­est out­ra­geous am­bushes on un­sus­pect­ing par­tic­i­pants has spread like wild­fire, with Mr Gi­u­liani is­su­ing an an­gry de­nial on Wed­nes­day af­ter be­ing tricked into a ho­tel room “in­ter­view” with an at­trac­tive and flir­ta­tious young woman.</p>
    <p>In the film, the en­counter ap­pears to leave the for­mer New York mayor, 76, i n a highly com­pro­mis­ing sit­u­a­tion, quite lit­er­ally with his hands down his pants in the bed­room.</p>
    <p>Mr Gi­u­liani said on Wed­nes­day that the scene was “a com­plete fab­ri­ca­tion”.</p>
    <p>“I was tuck­ing in my shirt af­ter tak­ing off the record­ing equip­ment. At no time be­fore, dur­ing or af­ter the in­ter­view was I ever in­ap­pro­pri­ate,” he tweeted. “If Sacha Baron Co­hen im­plies oth­er­wise, he is a stone-cold liar.”</p>
    <p>Filmed in se­cret this sum­mer as the US coro­n­avirus lockdown eased, the fol­low-up movie again sees Baron Co­hen hood­wink mem­bers of the US public and politi­cians via his bum­bling and highly of­fen­sive reporter al­ter ego.</p>
    <p>Mr Gi­u­liani is far from the only Repub­li­can tar­get left red-faced by the movie.</p>
    <p>The film’s l oose premise sees Bo­rat – dis­graced by the first film’s events – of­fered a chance to re­deem him­self and his coun­try by pre­sent­ing a gift to US Vi­cePres­i­dent Mike Pence, who ap­pears briefly in the movie.</p>
    <p>Mul­ti­ple sub­jects of the orig­i­nal film, i nclud­ing a pair of brash, drunken col­lege stu­dents, sued the film-mak­ers for con­ning them into ap­pear­ing in the movie.</p>
    <p>The fol­low-up film is al­ready the sub­ject of a law­suit from the es­tate of a Holo­caust sur­vivor who died this year, shortly af­ter she was filmed talk­ing with Baron Co­hen by a small fake doc­u­men­tary crew.</p>
    <p>Ms Ju­dith Dim Evans ap­pears in the film to ed­u­cate Bo­rat on the Holo­caust and is pre­sented in a pos­i­tive light.</p>
    <p>“Upon learn­ing af­ter giv­ing the in­ter­view that t he movie was ac­tu­ally a comedy in­tended to mock the Holo­caust and Jewish cul­ture, Ms Evans was hor­ri­fied and up­set,” reads the law­suit filed by her daugh­ter .</p>
    <p>Baron Co­hen, who is Jewish, is an out­spo­ken cam­paigner against anti-Semitism and con­spir­acy the­o­ries, par­tic­u­larly against their spread on so­cial-me­dia plat­forms.</p>
