    <p>Stuffed dough­nuts are all the rage now in th­ese stress­ful times. The deep-fried dough balls saw a surge in de­mand dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, when crav­ing for sweet nos­tal­gic treats peaked.</p>
    <p>Ex­pect to wait about a month to get your hands on the dough­nuts from Burnt Ends Bak­ery – the spin-off bak­ery arm of one-Miche­lin-starred Burnt Ends restau­rant. Mean­while, Sour­bombe Ar­ti­sanal Bak­ery’s sour­dough bom­bolini (Ital­ian stuffed dough­nuts) get snapped up in un­der 10 min­utes when pre­orders are re­leased.</p>
    <p>City Donut in Mc­Cal­lum Street – a part­ner­ship be­tween Mr Wei Chan of heartland bak­ery The Pine Gar­den and food and bev­er­age group Mi­nor Food Sin­ga­pore – sees con­stant snaking queues for its lo­cal flavours since open­ing in Septem­ber. Its orh nee (yam), pan­dan on­deh on­deh, pu­lut hi­tam (black gluti­nous rice dessert) and the re­cently re­leased black sesame dough­nuts get snapped up round the clock.</p>
    <p>Rid­ing on the trend, many home-grown on­line bak­eries are now look­ing to open phys­i­cal stores. On­line home bak­ery Puffs and Peaks opens its store this Thurs­day at Tampines Cen­tral Com­mu­nity Com­plex. Which are worth the calo­ries?</p>
    <p>To suss out the best in town, The Sun­day Times short­listed 10 choco­late and hazel­nut stuffed dough­nuts for a blind taste test. The judg­ing panel com­prised ST food edi­tor Tan Hsueh Yun and en­ter­tain­ment and nightlife re­porter An­jali Ragu­ra­man, along with guest judges Bjorn Shen, chef-owner of Ar­ti­choke restau­rant, and Len­nard Yeong, in-house chef at lux­ury home ap­pli­ance brand Miele Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Each dough­nut was awarded up to 10 points each in three cat­e­gories – taste, tex­ture and ap­pear­ance; up to a to­tal of 120 points from the four judges.</p>
    <p>And the win­ner was the choco­late sour­dough bom­bolini from home-based busi­ness The Fat Kid Bak­ery, fol­lowed by the choco­late brioche dough­nuts from Nassim Hill Bak­ery in Tan­glin Road.</p>
    <p>The hazel­nut ones fared well too.</p>
    <p>In third place was the mini Nutella bom­bolini from Mus­lim-owned home busi­ness Dough & Bat­ter, while the choco­late hazel­nut brioche dough­nuts from All Thing De­li­cious cafe in Arab Street came in at No. 4. Round­ing off the top five was the Nutella brioche dough­nuts from Burnt Ends Bak­ery in Teck Lim Road.</p>
    <p>The other five brands fea­tured in the test were home-grown Plain Vanilla Bak­ery, Dough­nut Shack and Welovedel­ish, along with Har­ritts Donuts & Cof­fee from Ja­pan and Amer­i­can chain Krispy Kreme.</p>
    <p>Some com­mon is­sues the judges flagged in­cluded dense and oily dough and in­suf­fi­cient choco­late filling.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan said: “My con­clu­sion is that most places don’t use good choco­late and don’t change the oil (for fry­ing) as of­ten as they should. The ones that scored well had good dough tex­ture and de­li­cious filling.”</p>
    <p>For Mr Shen, his favourite dough­nuts must have a good crumb that is not too dry or rough.</p>
    <p>He said: “The Fat Kid Bak­ery’s dough­nut was the only so­phis­ti­cated one which gave me two lev­els of flavour – choco­late fol­lowed by the tang from the sour­dough that blew my mind. Dough­nuts are dough­nuts; no mat­ter how you el­e­vate them, they are fried food. I’m not eat­ing a dough­nut for health rea­sons.”</p>
