    <p>Lo­gis­tics gi­ant Deutsche Post DHL Group is in­creas­ing its work­force in Sin­ga­pore. DHL Ex­press, with a work­force of 1,600 here, has hired 57 per­ma­nent staff in the past few months, ahead of a surge in de­liv­ery and ship­ment vol­umes ex­pected dur­ing the year-end hol­i­day season.</p>
    <p>Deutsche Post DHL Group, the Bonn-based global trans­port and lo­gis­tics gi­ant, is in­creas­ing its work­force in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>De­liv­ery and ship­ment vol­umes have al­ready risen to un­prece­dented lev­els as economies world­wide re­cover from the shock of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, DHL Ex­press chief ex­ec­u­tive John Pear­son and DHL Ex­press Sin­ga­pore man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Christo­pher Ong told The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>DHL Ex­press, with a work­force of 1,600 here, has hired 57 per­ma­nent staff in the past two months, ahead of an­other surge in vol­umes ex­pected dur­ing the hol­i­day season.</p>
    <p>DHL Ex­press is the group’s in­ter­na­tional time-def­i­nite air de­liv­ery unit and the largest of its five busi­ness di­vi­sions. The oth­ers are global for­ward­ing and freight, sup­ply chain, e-commerce and Post Paket Deutsch­land.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is the Asia-Pa­cific re­gional head­quar­ters for DHL’s lo­gis­tics op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong, who worked for about a decade at Sin­ga­pore in­vest­ment com­pany Te­masek be­fore join­ing DHL in 2006, said most of the new hires are front-line staff – couri­ers, op­er­a­tions agents and cus­tomer ser­vice agents, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has also hired four tem­po­rary em­ploy­ees for sales and 12 fresh grad­u­ates as trainees.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said: “De­spite the chal­lenges at the on­set of the Covid-19 pan­demic, we have ac­tu­ally seen a very healthy im­prove­ment in our vol­umes. In fact, we are see­ing un­prece­dented vol­umes com­ing both in and out of Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany saw a global dou­ble-digit plunge in rev­enues in April amid na­tion­wide lock­downs to con­trol the pan­demic. But busi­ness has since re­cov­ered sharply.</p>
    <p>Ris­ing vol­umes world­wide helped Deutsche Post DHL Group post a 4.4 per cent in­crease in third-quar­ter rev­enue to US$19.1 bil­lion (S$25.6 bil­lion) and earn­ings be­fore in­ter­est and taxes of US$1.62 bil­lion, up 46 per cent from the year-ear­lier pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The com­pany in Oc­to­ber raised its 2020 earn­ings guid­ance range to be­tween US$4.8 bil­lion and US$5.1 bil­lion – from US$4.1 bil­lion to US$4.4 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Look­ing at the hir­ing drive from global per­spec­tive, Mr Pear­son said the firm has taken on board over 10,000 peo­ple world­wide to deal with the hol­i­day season and a likely fur­ther surge in vol­umes next year.</p>
    <p>Vol­umes will in­crease next year as economies world­wide ad­vance to­wards full re­cov­ery from the Covid-19-in­duced down­turn, even as in­ter­na­tional travel may re­main very lim­ited.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing for­ward, there is a need for more peo­ple be­cause a lot of trans­ac­tion vol­ume has moved to on­line de­liv­ery chan­nels, as peo­ple can’t travel,” said Mr Pear­son.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, many doc­u­ments and other small pack­ages that peo­ple used to carry along with them as they travel are now be­ing de­liv­ered via ex­press de­liv­ery of­fered by com­pa­nies such as DHL.</p>
    <p>The travel curbs have also led to a rapid ac­cel­er­a­tion of e-commerce, par­tic­u­larly in the busi­ness-to-con­sumer area, Mr Pear­son added.</p>
    <p>A ma­jor plank of new busi­ness for lo­gis­tic com­pa­nies like DHL will be the dis­tri­bu­tion of vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Pear­son: “I am sure ev­ery­one is go­ing to get a piece of the ac­tion. But no one is set up bet­ter than us, in the sense of our foot­print.”</p>
    <p>He added that DHL’s pres­ence in 220 coun­tries and its sup­ply chain ca­pa­bil­i­ties in life sci­ence and health­care will en­sure that it leads the global dis­tri­bu­tion of vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said DHL is the top provider of trans­port and stor­age for tem­per­a­ture-sen­si­tive prod­ucts in the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion.</p>
    <p>DHL Med­i­cal Ex­press has years of ex­pe­ri­ence in ship­ping in­ves­ti­ga­tional medic­i­nal prod­ucts, clin­i­cal sup­plies or pa­tient sam­ples to hos­pi­tals, lab­o­ra­to­ries or re­search cen­tres, he said.</p>
    <p>“We are pre­pared. Once the vac­cines start rolling out of pro­duc­tion fa­cil­i­ties, we are ready to de­liver them to stor­age or any other dis­tri­bu­tion point and then to clin­ics and hos­pi­tals,” added Mr Ong.</p>
