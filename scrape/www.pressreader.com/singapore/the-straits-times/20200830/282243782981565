    <p>About a week af­ter Ms Kather­ine Su­mantri was born, she came down with a fever that would not break for days. Sus­pect­ing menin­gi­tis, her doc­tor put the new­born on a course of an­tibi­otics, even be­fore any test re­sults came in.</p>
    <p>The doc­tor’s guess was right, and Ms Su­mantri made a full re­cov­ery – es­cap­ing com­pli­ca­tions such as brain dam­age, hearing loss, seizures and learn­ing dis­abil­i­ties that the con­di­tion can bring about.</p>
    <p>“My par­ents told me that if we had waited, worse things could have hap­pened to me. Growing up, they re­minded me of how grate­ful I should be,” says the 25-year-old.</p>
    <p>This has com­pelled her to choose a ca­reer where she can give back. Born to a Ja­panese mother and an In­done­sian-Chi­nese fa­ther who is now a Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen, Ms Su­mantri, a per­ma­nent res­i­dent here, says she is drawn to­wards work­ing with chil­dren with spe­cial needs.</p>
    <p>Af­ter ob­tain­ing her bach­e­lor’s de­gree in spe­cial education from Gon­zaga Univer­sity in Wash­ing­ton, the United States, she is now do­ing a mas­ter’s in speech­language pathol­ogy at Columbia Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Study­ing in the US has made her more aware of cul­tural dif­fer­ences to­wards dis­abil­ity here and abroad.</p>
    <p>“I find that peo­ple here tend to stray from dif­fi­cult top­ics such as dis­abil­ity, sui­cide and men­tal health. But in the US, there are many so­cial-me­dia in­flu­encers with dis­abil­i­ties who use their plat­form to talk about these is­sues,” she says.</p>
    <p>This drove her to launch (en)able (@en.abled on In­sta­gram) in May, an on­line plat­form that presents facts, de­bunks myths and show­cases real-life ac­counts of dis­abil­i­ties such as autism and Down syn­drome.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Ms Su­mantri has fea­tured two women who have brothers with autism. They both told her that their fam­i­lies are em­bar­rassed to bring them out for fear of judg­ment from the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>“When my brother has a melt­down, we know it is dis­rup­tive, but forc­ing him to stop would be crush­ing his need to self-reg­u­late,” wrote one of them, who hopes Sin­ga­pore can cre­ate a more wel­com­ing en­vi­ron­ment for in­di­vid­u­als with autism.</p>
    <p>Ms Su­mantri, who in­tends to gain work ex­pe­ri­ence in the US be­fore re­turn­ing to Sin­ga­pore for the long term, says she wants to bring about a more open dis­cus­sion about dis­abil­ity, where peo­ple can freely ask ques­tions, ed­u­cate them­selves and share that in­for­ma­tion with oth­ers.</p>
    <p>She says: “I know it is scary and un­cer­tain when you don’t know the right things to say or don’t want to be of­fen­sive, but we have to talk about un­com­fort­able things to move for­ward as a so­ci­ety.”</p>
