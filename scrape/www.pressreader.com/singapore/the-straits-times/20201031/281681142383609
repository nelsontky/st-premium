    <p>Con­gre­gants are now able to use ei­ther the TraceTo­gether app or to­ken to check in at 40 of Sin­ga­pore’s 71 mosques, with the Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore (Muis) gear­ing up for the end of the year, when TraceTo­gether check-ins will be made com­pul­sory at pub­lic venues.</p>
    <p>Such check-ins were in­tro­duced at an ini­tial 24 mosques on Oct 19, and at an­other 16 mosques on Oct 23.</p>
    <p>Muis did not say when TraceTo­gether check-ins will be rolled out at the re­main­ing 31 mosques, or when such check-ins will be made com­pul­sory.</p>
    <p>For now, con­gre­gants can still use the older meth­ods of scan­ning SafeEn­try QR codes with a phone cam­era or the SingPass mo­bile app, or bar codes on NRICs.</p>
    <p>But staff at mosques have been in­structed to en­cour­age con­gre­gants to down­load the TraceTo­gether app.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment an­nounced on Oct 20 that us­ing the TraceTo­gether app or to­ken to check in would be made manda­tory at pub­lic venues, such as cin­e­mas, restau­rants, work­places, schools and shop­ping malls, by the end of De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>One mosque, Masjid Al-Falah in Or­chard Road, has even in­tro­duced a green lane that al­lows wor­ship­pers us­ing the app or to­ken to gain en­try more quickly.</p>
    <p>“Us­ing the app or to­ken makes the flow of con­gre­gants en­ter­ing our fa­cil­ity faster. Many of our con­gre­gants are ac­tu­ally work­ers around the area, so time is of the essence for them,” Masjid Al­Falah ex­ec­u­tive chair­man Khairul An­war said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Pre­vi­ously, we al­lowed en­try only by way of scan­ning (the bar codes on) ICs, so that would have taken a bit of time.”</p>
    <p>He added that TraceTo­gether also gives con­gre­gants greater peace of mind with the “en­hanced safety” from real-time con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>About half of the 100 con­gre­gants who went for the first mid­day prayer ser­vice yes­ter­day were seen us­ing TraceTo­gether. The vast ma­jor­ity were us­ing the app, with The Straits Times spot­ting only three con­gre­gants with to­kens.</p>
    <p>Mr Yu­sope Mun­til, 75, was one of them. He col­lected his to­ken from Craw­ford Com­mu­nity Cen­tre about two weeks ago, when to­kens were still be­ing dis­trib­uted at nearly 40 com­mu­nity cen­tres.</p>
    <p>“Us­ing the to­ken is bet­ter for me be­cause some­times, when I go out, I might for­get to bring my IC along (to scan), and I am not sure how to use the app,” said the cleaner. “The process (to get into the mosque) was very fast and smooth.”</p>
    <p>De­liv­ery rider Az­izan Mat Shukor, 35, said he col­lected a to­ken at Cairn­hill Com­mu­nity Cen­tre three weeks ago, af­ter mosque staff sug­gested that he do so.</p>
    <p>“I use it ev­ery­where I go, not just when I come to the mosque. It is much more con­ve­nient than us­ing (the app on) my phone be­cause some­times it might be low on bat­tery, or I don’t have a good data con­nec­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>To­ken dis­tri­bu­tion was halted on Wed­nes­day by the Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Govern­ment Group (SNDGG) fol­low­ing re­ports of long queues at some com­mu­nity cen­tres or clubs (CCs) last week­end, and re­sumed in a lim­ited fash­ion on Thurs­day at Mar­sil­ing Com­mu­nity Club.</p>
    <p>New col­lec­tion venues will now be opened one con­stituency at a time un­til De­cem­ber, and res­i­dents can col­lect to­kens only from the CC in the con­stituency that they live in. The next CC to open for col­lec­tion is Wood­grove to­day.</p>
    <p>The SNDGG said on Thurs­day that TraceTo­gether-only SafeEn­try will be en­forced only when ev­ery­one who needs a to­ken is able to col­lect one at a CC near them.</p>
