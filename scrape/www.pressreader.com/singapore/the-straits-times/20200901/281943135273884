    <p>SHANG­HAI/SYD­NEY • China yes­ter­day launched an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into al­leged govern­ment sub­si­dies of some Aus­tralian wine im­ports, a widely ex­pected fol­low-up to an anti-dump­ing probe that Aus­tralian rep­re­sen­ta­tives said they would op­pose.</p>
    <p>The in­ves­ti­ga­tions come against a back­drop of in­creas­ing ten­sions be­tween the coun­tries af­ter Can­berra called for an in­ter­na­tional in­quiry into the ori­gins of the coro­n­avirus, which was first de­tected in China’s cen­tral city of Wuhan.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing im­posed tar­iffs on Aus­tralian bar­ley in May fol­low­ing ac­cu­sa­tions that the grain was be­ing ex­ported at a loss, or “dumped”. It then sus­pended some beef im­ports, be­fore start­ing an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into dump­ing of Aus­tralian wine, an ac­cu­sa­tion Can­berra has re­futed.</p>
    <p>China’s Com­merce Min­istry said in an on­line state­ment it would now in­ves­ti­gate some 37 Aus­tralian wine sub­sidy schemes fol­low­ing a re­quest from the China Wine In­dus­try As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond probe, which would take up to a year, would look into Aus­tralian sup­port mea­sures in­clud­ing “farm risk man­age­ment”, a “farm financing loan scheme” and “busi­ness growth fund­ing projects”, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Trade Min­is­ter Si­mon Birm­ing­ham said the sec­ond wine probe had been “broadly fore­shad­owed” when the ini­tial anti-dump­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tion was ini­ti­ated.</p>
    <p>“We strongly re­fute claims that ini­tia­tives like the Mur­ray-Dar­ling Basin Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Pro­gram, or pro­grammes that sup­port re­search and de­vel­op­ment equate to a sub­sidy of our wine ex­ports,” Mr Birm­ing­ham said in a state­ment, re­fer­ring to a scheme where the govern­ment buys wa­ter to im­prove the health of key wa­ter­ways.</p>
    <p>“The govern­ment will work with our in­ter­na­tion­ally renowned wine in­dus­try to mount the strong­est pos­si­ble case against th­ese claims.”</p>
    <p>China is the top market for Aus­tralian wine ex­ports and is also Aus­tralia’s largest trad­ing part­ner, with two-way trade worth A$235 bil­lion (S$235 bil­lion) last year.</p>
