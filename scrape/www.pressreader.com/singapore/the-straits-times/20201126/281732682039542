    <p>Tokyo Gov­er­nor Yuriko Koike yes­ter­day urged res­i­dents of Ja­pan’s sprawl­ing cap­i­tal to avoid go­ing out un­nec­es­sar­ily amid a flare-up of Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>She also asked restau­rants, bars and karaoke out­lets to close by 10pm from Saturday un­til Dec 17, with those that com­ply to be given 400,000 yen (S$5,140) in grants.</p>
    <p>“I urge res­i­dents to avoid non-es­sen­tial out­ings and take nec­es­sary so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures if they do need to go out,” Ms Koike said.</p>
    <p>She added that the early clo­sure re­quest was a dif­fi­cult call to make, given the ad­verse ef­fect it will have on liveli­hoods and the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed mea­sures es­sen­tially re­peat guide­lines that had worked to con­trol the Covid-19 spread ear­lier this year, and came as Tokyo recorded 401 new cases yes­ter­day. A more con­cern­ing statis­tic for Tokyo health of­fi­cials, how­ever, would be the 54 pa­tients who are in se­ri­ous con­di­tion. This is the city’s high­est fig­ure since May.</p>
    <p>Na­tion­wide, there were at least 1,943 new cases yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing 318 in Osaka, 181 in Hokkaido, 171 in Aichi, 161 in Kana­gawa and 101 in Hyogo. This brought the over­all tally to 138,496 cases.</p>
    <p>There were 21 fa­tal­i­ties, bring­ing the death toll to 2,036 peo­ple. The num­ber of pa­tients in se­ri­ous con­di­tion na­tion­wide hit a new high, with the 376 cases as at yes­ter­day sur­pass­ing the high of 328 that was set in April dur­ing the first wave.</p>
    <p>Be­sides Tokyo, Osaka also has a large num­ber of se­ri­ously ill pa­tients at 103. Pre­fec­ture of­fi­cials have asked restau­rants and bars in Osaka city to shut early be­tween to­mor­row and Dec 11.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion pres­i­dent Toshio Nak­a­gawa warned yes­ter­day that health­care in­sti­tu­tions across the coun­try are “al­ready on the brink of col­lapse”, urg­ing more de­ci­sive lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>Hos­pi­tal clus­ters have led to dire man­power short­ages in some ar­eas, while the surge in Covid-19 cases means re­sources that are or­di­nar­ily de­voted to treat­ing other con­di­tions will be di­verted.</p>
    <p>Dr Nak­a­gawa said: “This could in turn lead to deaths that are oth­er­wise pre­ventable.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ya­su­toshi Nishimura, Ja­pan’s min­is­ter in charge of Covid-19 strat­egy, said the next three weeks are key to stop­ping the spread.</p>
    <p>Although the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in Ja­pan is ar­guably worse than it has ever been, a state of emer­gency like the one called from April 7 to May 25 is highly un­likely.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga has pri­ori­tised eco­nomic re­cov­ery and yes­ter­day staunchly de­fended the Go To Travel do­mes­tic tourism</p>
    <p>cam­paign to spur con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>He said there was “no ev­i­dence” to show that the scheme has been</p>
    <p>a di­rect cause of the re­cent surge, adding: “It is a fact that Go To Travel is pro­vid­ing sup­port to lo­cal economies.”</p>
    <p>He had abruptly an­nounced a par­tial shut­down of the cam­paign last Saturday, and left it up to pre­fec­tural gover­nors to de­cide whether to be ex­cluded from the cam­paign.</p>
    <p>News­pa­per ed­i­to­ri­als crit­i­cised the lack of clar­ity be­hind the de­ci­sion, say­ing that it only brought con­fu­sion and be­wil­der­ment.</p>
    <p>In­com­ing tourists to Osaka and Sap­poro will not qual­ify for the hefty sub­si­dies un­der the cam­paign, which runs un­til Dec 15, but res­i­dents of both ci­ties can qual­ify for the sub­si­dies when they travel to other parts of Ja­pan. Also, Tokyo re­mains part of the cam­paign de­spite be­ing the out­break epi­cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Ms Koike noted that the na­tional gov­ern­ment had de­cided uni­lat­er­ally to ex­clude Tokyo from the cam­paign from July un­til cases eased in Septem­ber, and said the buck should not stop with her now.</p>
