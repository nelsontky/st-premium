    <p>About a quar­ter of or­gan­i­sa­tions in Sin­ga­pore plan to in­tro­duce or con­tinue with salary freezes next year, slightly lower than the 30 per cent that paused wage in­cre­ments this year.</p>
    <p>As for pay cuts, about 3 per cent of em­ploy­ers said they in­tend to im­ple­ment them next year, com­pared with the 29 per cent which made salary re­duc­tions this year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, most em­ploy­ers are tak­ing a wait-and-see ap­proach as they con­tinue to tread with cau­tion on salary in­cre­ments while nav­i­gat­ing the im­pact of the coro­n­avirus pandemic.</p>
    <p>This is ac­cord­ing to find­ings re­leased yesterday from Mercer’s an­nual To­tal Re­mu­ner­a­tion Sur­vey, which polled 992 com­pa­nies across 16 in­dus­tries this year.</p>
    <p>The over­all salary in­crease pro­jected for next year in Sin­ga­pore will soften slightly to 3.5 per cent, com­pared with 3.6 per cent this year, the study found.</p>
    <p>“Busi­nesses re­main cau­tiously op­ti­mistic about the fu­ture and are con­sid­er­ing more holis­tic tal­ent strate­gies to en­er­gise their em­ploy­ees in the new shape of work,” Mercer’s chief ex­ec­u­tive for Sin­ga­pore Peta La­timer said, adding that some are rolling out ad­di­tional in­cen­tives, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>“Lead­ers are also looking ahead to at­tract and re­tain tal­ent re­quired to ac­cel­er­ate busi­ness dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion,” Ms La­timer noted.</p>
    <p>Salaries for the bank­ing and fi­nance sec­tor, as well as the high­tech sec­tor, are ex­pected to in­crease at a sta­ble rate in the year ahead.</p>
    <p>The lo­gis­tics and con­sumer goods in­dus­tries will likely see slightly big­ger in­cre­ments of 3.3 per cent and 3.5 per cent, re­spec­tively, com­pared with the in­creases of 3.1 per cent and 3.4 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>This “cor­re­lates with a shift in con­sumer pur­chas­ing be­hav­iours to on­line”, said Ms Ku­la­palee Tob­ing, Mercer’s ca­reer prod­ucts leader for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, wage growth is ex­pected to slow in the life sciences, real es­tate, chem­i­cals and life­style re­tail sec­tors next year. Em­ploy­ees in life­style re­tail may ex­pe­ri­ence the sharpest dip in in­cre­ments, with salaries ris­ing 2.9 per cent next year, com­pared with the 3.3 per cent in­crease this year.</p>
    <p>Ms Tob­ing noted that the pre­dic­tion of a smaller salary growth in the life­style re­tail in­dus­try was also un­sur­pris­ing, given the shift to on­line pur­chas­ing be­hav­iours, lower dis­cre­tionary spend­ing ca­pac­i­ties and re­duced leisure ac­tiv­ity due to the pandemic.</p>
    <p>This year, base salaries at the man­age­ment and ex­ec­u­tive lev­els inched up by 2 per cent and 1.2 per cent, re­spec­tively, from last year.</p>
    <p>That is a much slower growth than last year’s 6.8 per cent boost for man­age­ment and 7.1 per cent jump for ex­ec­u­tives.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers are also fac­ing in­ten</p>
    <p>sify­ing com­pe­ti­tion for tal­ent to sup­port the dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion of their busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>The most in-de­mand are data sci­en­tists, IT so­lu­tion ar­chi­tects, busi­ness in­tel­li­gence an­a­lysts and cy­ber se­cu­rity en­gi­neers, Mercer’s poll found.</p>
    <p>Roles that sup­port dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion ef­forts will at­tract salary pre­mi­ums, es­pe­cially at se­nior and spe­cial­ist lev­els, com­pared with the general mar­ket.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, spe­cial­ists who have ca­pa­bil­i­ties in cy­ber se­cu­rity in­ci­dent-re­sponse anal­y­sis are ex­pected to re­ceive wages that are 33 per cent higher than the me­dian an­nual base salary, while spe­cial­ists in ro­botic process au­to­ma­tion will get a 30 per cent pre­mium over the me­dian level.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, many com­pa­nies in Sin­ga­pore are fo­cus­ing on bump­ing up in­cen­tives and ben­e­fits to em­ploy­ees, as well as re­design­ing the work ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>About three in 10 of re­spon­dents</p>
    <p>said they are looking to add or ex­pand telemedici­ne or dig­i­tal care to their health pro­grammes next year.</p>
    <p>Half of the em­ploy­ers sur­veyed in­di­cated they will pro­vide or re­im­burse re­mote-work­ing ex­penses such as In­ter­net bills, lap­tops and mo­bile phones. They are also con­sid­er­ing giv­ing more flex­i­bil­ity for on-site and re­mote work­ing.</p>
    <p>A grow­ing num­ber of Sin­ga­pore banks, which are among the largest em­ploy­ers in the coun­try, will make flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments a per­ma­nent fix­ture.</p>
    <p>DBS Bank an­nounced a slew of new prac­tices for its 29,000-strong work­force, in­clud­ing the op­tion to work re­motely up to 40 per cent of the time and a for­mal job-shar­ing scheme.</p>
    <p>United Over­seas Bank will in­sti­tute a two-day work-from-home pol­icy, while May­bank Sin­ga­pore has plans to adopt a hybrid work­ing model.</p>
    <p>Half of the em­ploy­ers sur­veyed in­di­cated that they will pro­vide or re­im­burse re­mote-work­ing ex­penses such as In­ter­net bills, lap­tops and mo­bile phones. They are also con­sid­er­ing giv­ing more flex­i­bil­ity for on-site and re­mote work­ing.</p>
