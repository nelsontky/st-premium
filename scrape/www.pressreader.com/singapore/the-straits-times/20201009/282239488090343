    <p>Ju­ven­tus de­fender Danilo said on Wed­nes­day he feels ready to fi­nally as­sume the role of Brazil’s first-choice right­back, more than nine years af­ter mak­ing his in­ter­na­tional de­but.</p>
    <p>The 29-year-old is ex­pected to start for the five-time world cham­pi­ons when they meet Bo­livia in Sao Paulo to­day and Peru in Lima on Tues­day in the open­ing two rounds of South Amer­ica’s 2022 World Cup qual­i­fiers.</p>
    <p>“With­out doubt it’s an im­por­tant time in my ca­reer,” Danilo, who has been capped 25 times, told a vir­tual news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>He said he did not feel daunted by Brazil’s rich his­tory of right-sided de­fend­ers such as Carlos Al­berto, Cafu and Dani Alves.</p>
    <p>“I’ve reached a level of ma­tu­rity that has al­lowed me to be a part of the na­tional team,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It’s a po­si­tion in which we’ve al­ways had play­ers with a lot of qual­ity that have cre­ated his­tory.</p>
    <p>“Now is an op­por­tune time... to ce­ment my place. I al­ways say that it’s im­por­tant to feel the re­spon­si­bil­ity of play­ing for the na­tional team.</p>
    <p>“I’ve bat­tled with Dani (Alves) for a place in the team and that has made me a bet­ter player. I’m play­ing well for my club, I’m happy, and I think that ev­ery­thing that I’ve ex­pe­ri­enced in foot­ball un­til now has given me what I need to be able to play for Brazil’s na­tional team.”</p>
    <p>Danilo de­scribed him­self as for­tu­nate for hav­ing worked un­der man­agers such as Zine­dine Zi­dane, Pep</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola and An­drea Pirlo. And he de­scribed him­self as a more com­plete player now than the one who left San­tos to join Porto in 2012.</p>
    <p>“I play dif­fer­ently now, with a stronger fo­cus on pass­ing the ball and help­ing to con­struct the play,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Paris Saint-Ger­main for­ward Ney­mar is a doubt for the match against Bo­livia be­cause of a back prob­lem, Brazil’s team doc­tor Ro­drigo Las­mar said.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old was forced to leave a train­ing ses­sion at Brazil’s Granja Co­mary base in Tere­sopo­lis, near Rio de Janeiro, to un­dergo phys­io­ther­apy.</p>
    <p>“He has started treat­ment. We’ll eval­u­ate him again be­fore train­ing (on Thurs­day) and we’ll have a bet­ter idea then,” Dr Las­mar said.</p>
    <p>There was bet­ter news in­volv­ing for­ward Richarli­son, who trained freely af­ter in­jur­ing his left an­kle while play­ing for Ever­ton in their 4-2 Premier League win over Brighton last Satur­day.</p>
