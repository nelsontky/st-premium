    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The US has i mposed sanc­tions at a record-shat­ter­ing pace of about three times a day dur­ing Pres­i­dent Donald Trump’s time in of­fice: a slew of mea­sures tar­get­ing com­pa­nies, in­di­vid­u­als and even oil tankers tied to Iran, North Korea, China, Venezuela and Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Biden’s team is promis­ing a top-to-bot­tom re­view of sanc­tions op­er­a­tions, but a sig­nif­i­cant slow­down on his watch is not ex­pected.</p>
    <p>About seven weeks be­fore the in­au­gu­ra­tion, Mr Biden’s picks for top ad­min­is­tra­tion slots are mak­ing clear that eco­nomic re­stric­tions on coun­tries will re­main an es­sen­tial tool, even if they do not like ev­ery­thing about the way Mr Trump used them.</p>
    <p>Mr Ade­wale “Wally” Adeyemo, cho­sen by Mr Biden to be the No. 2 of­fi­cial at the Trea­sury, plans to re­view how the Ter­ror­ism and Fi­nan­cial In­tel­li­gence unit, or TFI, at the Trea­sury operates, peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said.</p>
    <p>That in­cludes an eval­u­a­tion of cur­rent pro­grammes, staffing and bud­gets, ac­cord­ing to the peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Yet the con­vic­tion that sanc­tions re­main cru­cial un­der­scores just how cen­tral they have be­come to the way the US con­ducts for­eign pol­icy, us­ing its eco­nomic might as much as its mil­i­tary power to get what it wants abroad, even when close al­lies dis­agree.</p>
    <p>Un­der Mr Trump, the US took over 3,900 dis­tinct sanc­tions ac­tions, data col­lected by law firm Gib­son Dunn shows, with a surge in 2018, when the ad­min­is­tra­tion rein­tro­duced many Iran penal­ties after it ex­ited the 2015 nu­clear deal backed by al­lies in­clud­ing Bri­tain, France and Ger­many. No pre­vi­ous ad­min­is­tra­tion had ex­ceeded 700 sanc­tions ac­tions a year.</p>
    <p>The US ap­proach un­der Mr Trump was more hos­tile, with the ar­gu­ment be­ing that com­pa­nies would fall into line whether they liked it or not be­cause ac­cess to the US fi­nan­cial sys­tem was too pre­cious to them. Complaints that the overuse of fi­nan­cial sanc­tions would un­der­mine the dol­lar’s pri­macy were quickly dis­missed.</p>
    <p>Sanc­tions ex­perts say that while the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s sanc­tions were of­ten ef­fec­tive, there were times when they seemed to serve as pub­lic re­la­tions more than sound eco­nomic pol­icy, some­thing they say they do not ex­pect to see from Mr Biden’s ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think they will be scal­ing back on sanc­tions, they will be scal­ing back on the mis­use of sanc­tions,” said Mr Daniel Fried, a for­mer am­bas­sador, as­sis­tant sec­re­tary and State Depart­ment sanc­tions co­or­di­na­tor in Demo­cratic and Repub­li­can ad­min­is­tra­tions.</p>
    <p>It may scale back “on use of sanc­tions as a purely mes­sag­ing tool or a me­dia-cy­cle man­age­ment de­vice – sanc­tions be­cause you want to look like you’re be­ing tough”.</p>
