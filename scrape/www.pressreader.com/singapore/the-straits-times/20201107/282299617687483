    <p>The Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) found it­self in a co­nun­drum in the re­cent case con­cern­ing for­mer Tem­busu Col­lege don Jeremy Fer­nando (Po­lice re­port made with­out our con­sent, say vic­tims, Nov 1).</p>
    <p>NUS made a po­lice re­port about Dr Fer­nando’s ac­tions, de­spite both vic­tims hav­ing de­clined to file their own re­ports. NUS has since ex­plained that it was legally ob­li­gated to do so un­der Sec­tion 424 of the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code.</p>
    <p>Recog­nis­ing that this may dis­cour­age fu­ture vic­tims from speak­ing up, NUS dean of stu­dents Leong Ching stated that the de­ci­sion was “one of the most dif­fi­cult dilem­mas” the univer­sity faced.</p>
    <p>NUS is not alone in fac­ing such a tricky sit­u­a­tion. Other in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing, schools, pas­toral care ser­vices, sup­port ser­vice or­gan­i­sa­tions and com­pa­nies have been in a sim­i­lar sit­u­a­tion – de­cid­ing whether to re­port when the vic­tim does not want to.</p>
    <p>Re­port­ing is man­dated “in the ab­sence of rea­son­able ex­cuse” and it is un­clear if vic­tims not want­ing the or­gan­i­sa­tion to re­port con­sti­tutes “rea­son­able ex­cuse”.</p>
    <p>Manda­tory re­port­ing can com­pound the feel­ings of help­less­ness that often af­flict sexual as­sault sur­vivors.</p>
    <p>It can also have the un­in­tended ef­fect of de­ter­ring such vic­tims from seek­ing help in the first place, for fear that they may be drawn into a po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tion against their wishes.</p>
    <p>We whole­heart­edly agree with Pro­fes­sor Chan Wing Cheong that Sec­tion 424 should be re­viewed (Clar­ity needed in le­gal duty to re­port crimes, Oct 28).</p>
    <p>Manda­tory re­port­ing laws fa­cil­i­tate law en­force­ment as they de­ter the con­ceal­ment of knowl­edge re­lat­ing to of­fences. So these laws can be help­ful.</p>
    <p>One way for­ward is the ap­proach taken by New South Wales where the law lim­its the manda­tory re­port­ing obli­ga­tion to sit­u­a­tions where a party knows that they have in­for­ma­tion that might be of ma­te­rial as­sis­tance in se­cur­ing the con­vic­tion of the of­fender.</p>
    <p>It also help­fully elab­o­rates that “rea­son­able ex­cuse” in­cludes sit­u­a­tions where adult vic­tims do not want a po­lice re­port to be made.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther, spe­cial per­mis­sion must be ob­tained to pros­e­cute the fol­low­ing pro­fes­sion­als for not re­port­ing: le­gal and med­i­cal prac­ti­tion­ers, so­cial work­ers and clergy.</p>
    <p>The As­so­ci­a­tion of Women for Ac­tion and Re­search once again asks that the state re­view Sec­tion 424 of the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code, and hopes the Gov­ern­ment will do this soon.</p>
