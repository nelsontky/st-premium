    <p>Char­tered bus op­er­a­tors, typ­i­cally own­ers of small fleets of about five ve­hi­cles, will now re­ceive more help from the Gov­ern­ment to au­to­mate their pro­cesses, ac­cel­er­at­ing a transition al­ready sharp­ened by the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>In a new thrust to­wards dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion headed by the Land Trans­port Author­ity and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore, it was an­nounced yes­ter­day that op­er­a­tors will re­ceive fi­nan­cial sub­si­dies, train­ing and free con­sul­tancy ad­vice to help with the change in what re­mains a stub­bornly tra­di­tional in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Im­prove­ments could in­clude hav­ing buses’ where­abouts tracked on a dig­i­tal map, in-built cam­eras that mon­i­tor driv­ers’ be­hav­iour, and in­te­grated sys­tems for on­line pay­ment and route plan­ning.</p>
    <p>With many char­tered buses used as school buses that deal with large num­bers of stu­dents, real-time track­ing can put par­ents’ minds at ease, while on­line pro­cesses can lessen the ad­min­is­tra­tive bur­den on char­tered bus com­pa­nies which still of­ten take at­ten­dance phys­i­cally and col­lect pay­ment in cash, bus op­er­a­tors said.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port and For­eign Af­fairs Chee Hong Tat, speak­ing at the launch of the dig­i­tal plan for char­tered bus ser­vices at the Land Trans­port Author­ity of­fice in Seran­goon, noted that the sec­tor has al­ready re­ceived about $30 mil­lion worth of sup­port this year.</p>
    <p>It com­prises schemes such as sea­son park­ing waivers at carparks and other grants to cush­ion the im­pact of the out­break.</p>
    <p>But it is now a “mat­ter of sur­vival” that char­tered bus op­er­a­tors take the op­por­tu­nity to mod­ernise, he said, dur­ing a time when tour buses have been quiet with no tourists, and fewer school buses are ply­ing the roads due to many school ac­tiv­i­ties be­ing sus­pended.</p>
    <p>“The cri­sis has pro­vided an added im­pe­tus for the sec­tor to re­think its busi­ness pro­cesses, and pre­pare for a new op­er­at­ing environmen­t.</p>
    <p>“Many of the so­lu­tions we see to­day, such as shared and on-de­mand trans­port ser­vices, are made pos­si­ble due to dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion as it al­lows com­pa­nies to process large vol­umes of data ef­fi­ciently.</p>
    <p>“Adop­tion of dig­i­tal so­lu­tions will ben­e­fit both driv­ers and op­er­a­tors,” he said.</p>
    <p>The char­tered bus ser­vices sec­tor is cur­rently made up of 10,600 buses owned by 3,500 dif­fer­ent in­di­vid­u­als and com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Un­like public trans­port giants, such as SMRT and SBS Tran­sit, many of these are fam­ily op­er­a­tors who have op­er­ated for gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Some are one-man op­er­a­tors who mul­ti­task by tak­ing on dif­fer­ent du­ties, in­clud­ing driv­ing, manag­ing op­er­a­tions, ad­min­is­tra­tion and finance, some­times re­quir­ing them to take calls while driv­ing, caus­ing po­ten­tial safety is­sues.</p>
    <p>An in­te­grated dig­i­tal sys­tem would help make sig­nif­i­cant sav­ings in man­power and time, while al­low­ing them to pay full at­ten­tion to the road, say bus op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>Mr Philip Peh, pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore School and Pri­vate Hire Bus Own­ers’ As­so­ci­a­tion, said the help ex­tended by the Gov­ern­ment will al­low those in the sec­tor to take “baby steps” to­wards dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The as­so­ci­a­tion worked with En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore to de­velop a cloud-based smart fleet man­age­ment sys­tem, which in­te­grates dig­i­tal pay­ment, route plan­ning and driver ros­ter sched­ul­ing func­tions, among oth­ers, into one plat­form.</p>
    <p>It will cost be­tween $6,000 and $7,000 per bus to use this sys­tem, Mr Peh said, so the 70 per cent cost sub­si­dies given by En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore to be­gin us­ing the sys­tem are of great help.</p>
    <p>Mrs Ellen Lau, a bus driver at Sil­veray Trans­port that pro­vides trans­port ser­vices for wheel­chair users and has adopted the cloud­based smart fleet man­age­ment sys­tem, said she finds the in-ve­hi­cle record­ing de­vices most use­ful.</p>
    <p>“In the event of a dis­pute, a halfa-minute to one-minute video can make the causes of the in­ci­dent clear and show who is re­spon­si­ble. This lets us solve the prob­lem am­i­ca­bly and re­lieves the pres­sure on us driv­ers,” she said.</p>
    <p>The dig­i­tal plan falls un­der the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Author­ity’s Go Dig­i­tal pro­gramme.</p>
