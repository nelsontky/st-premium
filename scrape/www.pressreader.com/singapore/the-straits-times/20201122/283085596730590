    <p>Liver­pool man­ager Jur­gen Klopp is hope­ful his young cen­tre-backs can step up in the ab­sence of se­nior team­mates, as the Premier League cham­pi­ons cope with an in­jury cri­sis.</p>
    <p>De­fend­ers Vir­gil van Dijk and Joe Gomez will both miss the ma­jor­ity of the cam­paign af­ter un­der­go­ing knee op­er­a­tions, mean­ing Joel Matip and Fabinho will be the Reds’ first-choice pair­ing un­til the Jan­uary trans­fer win­dow opens.</p>
    <p>How­ever, given the fix­ture crunch brought about by the coron­avirus pan­demic, nei­ther player will play ev­ery game.</p>
    <p>Re­serve Nathaniel Phillips, 23, and academy grad­u­ate Rhys Wil­liams, 19, will not only pro­vide cover but are also ex­pected to fea­ture in both top-flight games and in the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>Both will likely be on the bench in to­day’s home game against lead­ers Le­ices­ter as Klopp wres­tles with whether to name Fabinho in his start­ing line-up. The Brazil­ian, who has not played since pick­ing up an in­jury on Oct 27, re­turned to train­ing last week.</p>
    <p>Klopp will also be miss­ing key play­ers like cap­tain Jor­dan Hen­der­son, Thi­ago Al­can­tara, Trent Alexan­der-Arnold and Mo­hamed Salah, who tested pos­i­tive for the coron­avirus and is in quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>With Jamie Vardy, the Premier League’s joint-top scorer on eight goals, spear­head­ing Le­ices­ter’s at­tack against a weak­ened back­line, Klopp ad­mit­ted it would be “a chal­lenge to de­fend him” to­day.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Ger­man in­sisted his avail­able play­ers were not feel­ing sorry for them­selves.</p>
    <p>Ahead of the Foxes’ visit to An­field, he called their op­po­nents</p>
    <p>“con­tenders for ev­ery­thing”, but added: “We are a unit and the more prob­lems we have, the closer we stick to­gether.</p>
    <p>“We don’t go for ex­cuses, we have the sit­u­a­tion we have, we don’t like the in­juries we have be­cause it is re­ally hard for the boys who have the in­juries, but the rest are work­ing on so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>“Maybe we think we have the worst sit­u­a­tion pos­si­ble, but the sea­son is long. We have only played eight games, so there will be a lot of prob­lems.</p>
    <p>“If some­body thinks we will give up just be­fore the game just be­cause some of our best play­ers – our very, very im­por­tant play­ers – are not avail­able in the mo­ment for a long, long time, then I can­not help them.”</p>
    <p>Le­ices­ter man­ager Bren­dan Rodgers said his for­mer side re­main a for­mi­da­ble force. He added: “They’ve got top class play­ers. We’ve seen it our­selves with our in­juries that the play­ers have come in and done re­ally well and</p>
    <p>that’ll be the same for them.</p>
    <p>“Even with play­ers miss­ing it’s still a squad of world-class play­ers. You’re go­ing to have to be ag­gres­sive when you’re de­fend­ing and</p>
    <p>clin­i­cal in at­tack.</p>
    <p>“You want to play the best and they have clearly been that.”</p>
    <p>Klopp noted he found him­self in a sim­i­lar sit­u­a­tion at his for­mer club Borus­sia Dort­mund, when Neven Subotic and Mats Hum­mels were thrown into the deep end, only to gain the ex­pe­ri­ence to form the bedrock of his de­fen­sive line in two ti­tle-win­ning sea­sons.</p>
    <p>But, with Jan­uary com­ing in un­der six weeks, Klopp hinted he would con­sider dip­ping into the trans­fer mar­ket for re­in­force­ments, even though he is pre­pared to field some of his mid­field­ers in a makeshift de­fen­sive role if push comes to shove.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know what we can do in Jan­uary, to be hon­est. I have no idea,” he said. “That we look for so­lu­tions, look at the trans­fer mar­ket, that is clear of course.</p>
    <p>“But at the mo­ment, we have the sit­u­a­tion we have. We have mid­field­ers, not in the mo­ment but hope­fully in a cou­ple of weeks, who can play the more de­fen­sive role as well.”</p>
