    <p>As In­dia strug­gles to bring coro­n­avirus cases un­der con­trol, city- or state-spe­cific lock­downs have com­pli­cated eco­nomic re­cov­ery for the South Asian coun­try, which at one point was the world’s fastest grow­ing econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Cities and states have been com­ing in and out of lock­downs as the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties rush to con­trol the Covid-19 spread in the coun­try, which is now the world’s third mostaf­fected, af­ter the US and Brazil.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral state of Bi­har along with some north-east­ern states such as Sikkim are among those cur­rently un­der com­plete lock­down, with vary­ing de­grees of strict­ness.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties in Ker­ala, an early suc­cess story, are think­ing of im­pos­ing a fresh lock­down af­ter the state recorded an in­crease of more than 1,000 cases on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers are lift­ing lock­downs of any­where from three to 10 days.</p>
    <p>Life has been slowly re­turn­ing to nor­mal in IT hub Ben­galuru, which re­opened on Wed­nes­day af­ter a week-long lock­down that cost traders and in­dus­try 50 bil­lion ru­pees (S$925 mil­lion), ac­cord­ing to the Fed­er­a­tion of Kar­nataka Cham­bers of Com­merce and In­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The ces­sa­tion of ac­tiv­ity aside, un­cer­tainty, more than any­thing else, is com­pli­cat­ing re­cov­ery, said Mr Ma­hesh Vyas, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor and chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Cen­tre for Mon­i­tor­ing In­dian Econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“The un­cer­tainty as­so­ci­ated with lock­downs be­ing im­posed to­day and re­moved to­mor­row will have a di­rect im­pact on the re­cov­ery process be­cause no en­ter­prise can start oper­a­tions with­out be­ing sure of whether a lock­down is be­ing im­posed,” said Mr Vyas.</p>
    <p>“Many en­ter­prises have peo­ple who come from a dis­tance... who will be hes­i­tant to come to work. Sim­i­larly, if a com­pany pro­duces goods, there is un­cer­tainty of be­ing able to de­liver to­mor­row or re­ceive raw ma­te­ri­als.”</p>
    <p>He added that In­dia had seen a re­bound since a coun­try­wide lock­down was im­posed by the fed­eral gov­ern­ment in March, bring­ing eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity to a com­plete halt.</p>
    <p>The lock­down has been lifted in stages since mid-May, with in­dus­tries and busi­nesses first re­open­ing, fol­lowed by do­mes­tic flights and train ser­vices. Ho­tels, malls and restau­rants too have opened.</p>
    <p>“The worst (eco­nomic dis­tress) was in April and May. There was a re­bound in June,” said Mr Vyas, but he added that the econ­omy seemed to be “stag­nat­ing” at that level.</p>
    <p>In­dia was fac­ing a slow­ing econ­omy and a prob­lem of job­less growth even be­fore the pan­demic erupted and up­ended the global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Growth had reached a six-year low of 4.7 per cent in the fi­nal quar­ter of last year.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s econ­omy is ex­pected to con­tract be­tween 5 per cent and 10 per cent this fis­cal year, the poor­est per­for­mance in nearly four decades, ac­cord­ing to var­i­ous as­sess­ments.</p>
    <p>“Labour cri­sis, dis­rupted sup­ply chains, closed in­ter­na­tional ex­port mar­ket and risk aver­sion by banks to dis­burse credit to strug­gling cor­po­rate In­dia, en­sure we are still quite a few months away from early signs of re­vival in the In­dian econ­omy,” said Mr Rishi Sa­hai, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Co­gence Ad­vis­ers.</p>
    <p>“With a fis­cal deficit al­ready bal­loon­ing to 5 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct in the cur­rent year, the gov­ern­ment of In­dia has lit­tle head­room left to fund a bailout through tax and fis­cal in­cen­tives.”</p>
    <p>Still, the fed­eral gov­ern­ment has main­tained that small signs of re­vival are ap­par­ent with pre­dic­tions that growth would pick up next year.</p>
