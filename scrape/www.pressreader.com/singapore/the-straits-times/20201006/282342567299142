    <p>Jimmy But­ler in­sisted that even with two key starters hurt and two dou­ble-digit de­feats in the books, the Mi­ami Heat were not done in the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) Fi­nals.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, he showed it, de­liv­er­ing a 40-point triple-dou­ble in the Heat’s 115-104 vic­tory over the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers that cut the deficit in the best-of-seven cham­pi­onship se­ries to 2-1.</p>
    <p>“Phe­nom­e­nal,” was the ver­dict of LeBron James.</p>
    <p>The Lak­ers su­per­star should know. In his 10th trip to the show­piece se­ries, he was outscored, out­re­bounded and out-as­sisted for the first time in a Fi­nals game.</p>
    <p>But­ler com­pleted his first ca­reer play-off triple-dou­ble with 13 as­sists and 11 re­bounds, and he did so on 70 per cent shoot­ing, with­out at­tempt­ing a sin­gle three-pointer, while guard­ing James.</p>
    <p>“How else do you say it other than Jimmy ’eff­ing But­ler,” Heat coach Erik Spoel­stra said of the third player in Fi­nals his­tory to score 40 points in a triple-dou­ble af­ter James and Lak­ers legend Jerry West.</p>
    <p>“This was a very ur­gent game, and he was do­ing it on both ends of the court. Just put his im­print on ev­ery im­por­tant part of the game.”</p>
    <p>The Heat, seeded fifth in the East­ern Con­fer­ence, have al­ready ex­ceeded ex­pec­ta­tions by reach­ing the ti­tle se­ries, in which they have been hob­bled since start­ing cen­tre Bam Ade­bayo (neck) and point guard Go­ran Dragic (foot) went down with in­juries in Game 1.</p>
    <p>But­ler, not one to throw in the towel, said ef­fort was the key to bounc­ing back and mak­ing a se­ries of it de­spite the ab­sence of his team­mates.</p>
    <p>“You’ve got to empty the tank on ev­ery pos­ses­sion,” he said af­ter play­ing 45 minutes for the sec­ond straight game. “We’re go­ing to lay it all out there on the floor.”</p>
    <p>Kelly Olynyk and Tyler Herro did their part for Mi­ami at the NBA bub­ble in Dis­ney World with 17 points apiece.</p>
    <p>The Heat also changed their de­fence on An­thony Davis, who dom­i­nated the first two games of the se­ries. They dou­ble-teamed him early, forc­ing him to pass. The for­ward did not have a shot at­tempt in the first quar­ter. Davis was also sad­dled by early foul trou­ble, scor­ing just 15 points.</p>
    <p>James had a team-high 25 points, 10 re­bounds and eight as­sists, while Marki­eff Mor­ris and Kyle Kuzma each had 19 points off the bench, though Los An­ge­les were plagued by 20 turnovers.</p>
    <p>“We know that we can’t turn the ball over ver­sus this team,” said James, who was re­spon­si­ble for eight and walked off the court with about 10 sec­onds left on the clock.</p>
    <p>“It starts with my­self, be­ing the start­ing point guard for the team.”</p>
    <p>Spoel­stra said there was no time­line as yet for a pos­si­ble re­turn by ei­ther Ade­bayo or Dragic. Game 4 will take place to­day.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, But­ler says he will shoul­der what­ever l oad he needs to, for the sake of his team­mates on the floor – and for those side­lined by in­jury.</p>
    <p>“I go out there and I go to war for those guys be­cause when­ever they’re out there, they’re go­ing to war with and for me,” he said.</p>
    <p>How else do you say it other than Jimmy ’eff­ing But­ler? This was a very ur­gent game, and he was do­ing it on both ends of the court.</p>
