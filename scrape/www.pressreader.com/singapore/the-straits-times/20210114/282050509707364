        <p>The mod­ern world is a tech­no­log­i­cal world. Tech­nol­ogy is so deeply in­grained in our lives that most of us can­not imag­ine ever be­ing with­out it. But tech­nol­ogy is more than the gleam­ing gad­gets that are glued to our hands like ar­ti­fi­cial limbs. It is more than the com­put­ers that process and store our work. It is more than the op­ti­cal fi­bre and wire­less com­mu­ni­ca­tion in­fra­struc­ture that keeps every­thing run­ning.</p>
        <p>It is an ide­ol­ogy.</p>
        <p>The Ox­ford Dic­tionary de­fines ide­ol­ogy as “a set of be­liefs, con­vic­tions or ideas which both binds a par­tic­u­lar group of peo­ple to­gether and de­ter­mines the ac­tions they take”. Tech­nol­ogy is not just any ide­ol­ogy – it is the dom­i­nant ide­ol­ogy of our time.</p>
        <p>It is the or­der­ing and or­gan­is­ing prin­ci­ple of so­ci­ety, business, gov­ern­ment, cul­ture and ed­u­ca­tion. Even the arts, which long held out as the last refuge of tran­scen­dent, crit­i­cal and imag­i­na­tive think­ing, have not been spared.</p>
        <p>One of the main­stays of tech­nol­ogy-as-ide­ol­ogy is the be­lief that every prob­lem has a tech­ni­cal so­lu­tion. If the prob­lem is com­plex, it should be grad­u­ally sub­di­vided into sim­pler ones un­til they be­come an­a­lyt­i­cally tractable.</p>
        <p>This kind of re­duc­tion­ism, first out­lined by the philoso­phers Rene Descartes and Fran­cis Ba­con in the 17th cen­tury, be­came the con­cep­tual foun­da­tion of the</p>
        <p>Age of En­light­en­ment and the In­dus­trial Revo­lu­tion.</p>
        <p>Rapid eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment since then has vin­di­cated, in the eyes of many, the su­pe­ri­or­ity of techno-sci­en­tific think­ing. The tri­umph of rea­son over na­ture com­ing at the cost of an ir­re­versible de­struc­tion of the bio­sphere was con­sid­ered, in typ­i­cal ul­tra-ra­tio­nal fash­ion, an “ex­ter­nal­ity” – to be dealt with via some yet-to-be-de­vised tech­ni­cal fix.</p>
        <p>A VIRUS AS A PROB­LEM</p>
        <p>In the same vein, when a novel coro­n­avirus started spread­ing among hu­mans in late 2019, the log­i­cal re­ac­tion was not to crit­i­cally ex­am­ine over­pop­u­la­tion or wildlife trade, but to call for a tech­ni­cal so­lu­tion. The virus was an aber­ra­tion of na­ture, which had to be sub­dued.</p>
        <p>Time-tested mea­sures like wash­ing hands, wear­ing masks, phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing and quar­an­tine were not enough. We needed some­thing shiny, pro­gres­sive and dig­i­tal.</p>
        <p>In other words, we needed a smart­phone app. Sure enough, mere days af­ter the first virus cases were de­tected, pro­pos­als for tech­ni­cal so­lu­tions were be­ing floated. Soon af­ter, the first soft­ware prod­ucts be­came avail­able.</p>
        <p>Early apps and mini-pro­grams were de­signed to help peo­ple get through the cri­sis. Users could, for ex­am­ple, check their ex­po­sure on train rides, find a clinic, sched­ule an online con­sul­ta­tion with a doc­tor or buy masks and hand sani­tiser. Other ver­sions, al­ready more so­phis­ti­cated and in­tru­sive, mon­i­tored com­pli­ance with quar­an­tine or­ders.</p>
        <p>Last March, the China State Coun­cil launched a na­tional health QR code for mo­bile plat­forms. A green QR code means that a per­son is healthy and may safely travel. At the re­cent Group of 20 meet­ing, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping pro­posed a global sys­tem of QR codes in or­der to fa­cil­i­tate the flow of per­son­nel.</p>
        <p>While it is un­set­tling to imag­ine that the Chi­nese sys­tem of to­tal surveil­lance might be ex­ported to the rest of the world, Mr Xi is right to crit­i­cise the lack of global co­or­di­na­tion. It has led to the cre­ation of a ver­i­ta­ble zoo of mu­tu­ally in­com­pat­i­ble smart­phone apps, which is bound to ham­per the even­tual re­sump­tion of cross-bor­der travel.</p>
        <p>This hap­haz­ard and parochial ap­proach to soft­ware de­vel­op­ment stood in marked con­trast to the es­tab­lished prac­tice of bio­med­i­cal re­searchers who, through­out the en­tire cri­sis, shared in­for­ma­tion freely with col­leagues around the world. As sci­en­tists know, a virus has no na­tion­al­ity. It does not re­spect bor­ders. The only way to con­tain it is through in­ter­na­tional col­lab­o­ra­tion.</p>
        <p>CON­TACT TRAC­ING</p>
        <p>Among all the so­lu­tions that sprung up in the first quar­ter of last year, none at­tracted more in­ter­est and scru­tiny than prox­im­ity-based con­tact trac­ing.</p>
        <p>It seemed like a sim­ple and el­e­gant way to take ad­van­tage of the fact that many peo­ple now carry around a smart­phone all day wher­ever they go. When two phones get closer than a de­fined range, they ex­change a lit­tle piece of data through a Blue­tooth con­nec­tion. A log of such con­tact events is stored on each phone. When a per­son is in­fected, they can re­lease the log to the health au­thor­i­ties, al­low­ing them to iden­tify re­cent con­tacts.</p>
        <p>Not all were con­vinced it would work in prac­tice, among them Mr Bruce Sch­neier, a fel­low at Har­vard Univer­sity and a highly re­spected cy­ber-se­cu­rity ex­pert. In his view, which is echoed in a re­port pub­lished by the Brook­ings In­sti­tu­tion last May, con­tact trac­ing apps are in­ef­fec­tive be­cause they both un­der-re­port and over-re­port ex­po­sure events.</p>
        <p>The au­thors be­lieve that, due to these short­com­ings, peo­ple would soon lose trust in the apps and stop us­ing them.</p>
        <p>THE TRACETO­GETHER STORY</p>
        <p>With this in mind, it is worth re­vis­it­ing the story of Sin­ga­pore’s own con­tact trac­ing app. The TraceTo­gether app was re­leased on March 20 last year. Adop­tion was ini­tially rather slow.</p>
        <p>The use of the app or to­ken will soon be com­pul­sory for gain­ing ac­cess to work­places, shop­ping malls, restau­rants and other places where peo­ple gather. The adop­tion rate has now in­creased to about 80 per cent.</p>
        <p>Ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial state­ments, the app has helped re­duce the time it takes to iden­tify and iso­late close con­tacts from four days to two. That is a re­spectable re­sult. It shows that hand­held tools can play a part in public health pol­icy.</p>
        <p>At the same time, it is worth re­mem­ber­ing the hid­den and not-so-hid­den hu­man labour that makes this pos­si­ble. Just think of the thou­sands of se­cu­rity guards who mon­i­tor tem­per­a­ture scan­ners and check ad­mis­sion across the is­land.</p>
        <p>Then, this year, con­tro­versy erupted when it be­came known that the po­lice can re­quest data col­lected by the TraceTo­gether app for crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions – in di­rect con­tra­dic­tion with public as­sur­ances made last June that the app would be used “purely for con­tact trac­ing”.</p>
        <p>Two com­ments seem in or­der. First, it is com­mon and long­stand­ing prac­tice, here and else­where, for the po­lice to ob­tain ac­cess to priv­i­leged data un­der a court war­rant. Ar­ti­cle 1 of Sin­ga­pore’s Per­sonal Data Pro­tec­tion Act states clearly that an or­gan­i­sa­tion may col­lect per­sonal data about an in­di­vid­ual with­out con­sent if “the col­lec­tion is nec­es­sary for any in­ves­ti­ga­tion or pro­ceed­ings”. Pri­vacy has never granted im­mu­nity from crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
        <p>Sec­ond, and rather iron­i­cally, those who de­plored the breach of trust by the Gov­ern­ment most vo­cif­er­ously found no bet­ter out­let to air their grievances than Face­book, a plat­form whose en­tire business model hinges on the ex­pro­pri­a­tion of per­sonal data.</p>
        <p>It is worth em­pha­sis­ing that the most pro­lific and de­ter­mined data col­lec­tors in the last 15 years have not been state ac­tors, but pri­vate com­pa­nies.</p>
        <p>The Covid-19 cri­sis has laid bare our most ex­is­ten­tial vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties. None of the tech­nolo­gies that we hold so dear pro­tected us against a sim­ple vi­ral struc­ture.</p>
        <p>No ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence en­gine was even re­motely ca­pa­ble of em­u­lat­ing the com­plex re­search that sci­en­tists un­der­took in their clin­i­cal lab­o­ra­to­ries. No robot could repli­cate the cre­ativ­ity, hu­man touch and ex­pe­ri­ence of a nurse in the in­ten­sive care unit.</p>
        <p>To be sure, mod­ern tools helped enor­mously in de­cod­ing the ge­netic struc­ture of the virus and in de­vel­op­ing can­di­date vac­cines in record time.</p>
        <p>But, for the most part, it was the sheer per­se­ver­ance, in­ge­nu­ity and sac­ri­fice of doc­tors, nurses, re­searchers and health pro­fes­sion­als around the world that saved many lives.</p>
        <p>It is to them – and not to some tech­ni­cal con­trivance – that we owe our grat­i­tude. di­rec­tor of the Cen­tre on AI Tech­nol­ogy for Hu­mankind at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Business School. He teaches and writes about the eco­nomic and so­ci­etal im­pli­ca­tions of dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies.</p>
