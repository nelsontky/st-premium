    <p>Kids’ bak­ing classes seem like a pop­u­lar ac­tiv­ity this school hol­i­days, with places in such classes all snapped up at some bak­ing schools.</p>
    <p>At Lit­tle Bak­ers Lab in Seran­goon Gar­den Way, all its par­entchild and kids-only bak­ing classes are fully booked for this va­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Some par­ents have even re­served places in the school’s next run of classes in the March and June school hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>“With the travel re­stric­tions dur­ing the school hol­i­days, par­ent</p>
    <p>child classes have been re­ally pop­u­lar. It’s a great way to learn and bond to­gether,” says Lit­tle Bak­ers Lab founder Jan­ice Tan, 40, who started the school three years ago.</p>
    <p>An­other fac­tor could be smaller class sizes. Due to safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, Ms Tan can take in only eight stu­dents for each class in­stead of the usual 12.</p>
    <p>De­cem­ber school hol­i­day classes for kids are also fully booked at Creative Culinaire The School in Tiong Bahru, which con­ducts mostly pro­fes­sional and Skill­sFu­ture bak­ery cour­ses.</p>
    <p>Be­sides bak­ing skills, its founder and prin­ci­pal chef Judy Koh hopes to im­part val­ues such as re­spon­si­bil­ity to young par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>At a re­cent five-hour Christ­mas log cake-mak­ing class that The Straits Times ob­served, its chefin­struc­tor Alvin Lim, 32, would re­mind kids to wash the utensils and keep the ta­ble clean af­ter ev­ery step.</p>
    <p>“We want the kids to grow up to be re­spon­si­ble and learn to clean as they go,” says Ms Koh, 57, a for­mer ju­nior col­league lit­er­a­ture teacher who has two grown-up chil­dren and a three-year-old grand­daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>“Many kids now grow up in homes where there are maids. We want to in­stil in them an ap­pre­ci­a­tion for the hard work and peo­ple who do these jobs, and for them to learn to be in­de­pen­dent.”</p>
    <p>Culi­nary life­style store ToTT, which started kids’ cour­ses in 2010, has seen de­mand for these classes in­crease by 48 per cent this hol­i­days, com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>While chil­dren’s bak­ing classes are typ­i­cally held dur­ing the school hol­i­days, some places also hold classes monthly.</p>
    <p>ToTT, for ex­am­ple, runs five to eight Ju­nior Chef classes monthly and al­lows one adult to join in for each child.</p>
    <p>Like most en­rich­ment ac­tiv­i­ties, bak­ing classes do not come cheap. At ToTT, it costs $108 for a child and an adult for a two-hour ses­sion.</p>
    <p>But the fees have not de­terred par­ents from en­rolling their kids, say the schools.</p>
    <p>“More chil­dren are cu­ri­ous about bak­ing and cook­ing, from watch­ing tele­vi­sion shows like MasterChef Ju­nior. They have also be­come more food-savvy as they travel with their fam­i­lies,” says ToTT’s di­rec­tor Grace Tan, 42.</p>
    <p>“Par­ents also see the value in these classes. When you go out for a meal at a cafe these days, it eas­ily costs $20 to $40 for two peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“But top it up (for a course) and you get a meal, two hours of bond­ing with your child, and you learn a skill you can use again.”</p>
