    <p>Nor­man­ton Park, a 1,862-unit lease­hold con­do­minium pro­ject that was hit with a no-sale li­cence nearly two years ago, has got the green light to sell its units, but with con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>The largest and first new launch for next year will open for public pre­view on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Nor­man­ton Park com­prises 1,840 condo units, 22 strata ter­races and 8 shop units.</p>
    <p>To en­sure that the in­ter­ests of home buy­ers are pro­tected, the Con­troller of Hous­ing (COH) has re­quired that the sale of the units be sub­ject to sale li­cence con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>One of the con­di­tions re­quires de­vel­oper Kings­ford Hu­ray De­vel­op­ment to com­plete a Qual­ity Mark as­sess­ment for all units be­fore ap­ply­ing for a tem­po­rary oc­cu­pa­tion per­mit (TOP), a spokesman for the Ur­ban Rede­vel­op­ment Author­ity (URA) told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Es­sen­tially a vol­un­tary scheme, the Qual­ity Mark mea­sures the qual­ity of work­man­ship in each unit of a newly com­pleted pri­vate pro­ject. But the COH can stip­u­late the Qual­ity Mark as­sess­ment as a con­di­tion in a sale li­cence, where nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>The ban on sales of Nor­man­ton Park con­dos was ap­plied in Jan­uary last year after a raft of com­plaints from own­ers about shoddy work­man­ship and poor ameni­ties at the de­vel­oper’s other projects, in­clud­ing the Kings­ford Water­bay.</p>
    <p>De­vel­op­ers with a no-sale li­cence can be­gin con­struc­tion, but can­not sell units off-plan with­out ap­proval from the COH.</p>
    <p>The URA said the or­der was im­posed be­cause the de­vel­oper had failed to meet re­quire­ments for cer­tain build­ing works at Kings­ford Water­bay, such as its win­dows, bar­ri­ers and com­mon-storey shel­ter.</p>
    <p>The Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Author­ity had found that some build­ing works at Kings­ford Water­bay “de­vi­ated from re­quire­ments un­der the Build­ing Control Act and reg­u­la­tions”, the URA said.</p>
    <p>Feed­back about shoddy work­man­ship from own­ers of an­other</p>
    <p>To en­sure that the in­ter­ests of home buy­ers are pro­tected, the Con­troller of Hous­ing has re­quired that the sale of the units be sub­ject to sale li­cence con­di­tions. One of the con­di­tions re­quires de­vel­oper Kings­ford Hu­ray De­vel­op­ment to com­plete a Qual­ity Mark as­sess­ment for all units be­fore ap­ply­ing for a tem­po­rary oc­cu­pa­tion per­mit (TOP), a spokesman for the URA said.</p>
    <p>de­vel­op­ment, Kings­ford Hil­lview Peak in Bukit Pan­jang, was also taken into con­sid­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>But the ban was lifted on Nov 30 and a sales li­cence for Nor­man­ton Park was is­sued to Kings­ford Hu­ray after it “com­pleted the Kings­ford Water­bay with cer­tifi­cate of statu­tory com­ple­tion (CSC) and ti­tles is­sued”, the URA said.</p>
    <p>“The Kings­ford Hil­lview Peak pro­ject has also been is­sued with CSC and ti­tles, and the de­vel­oper has also taken steps to re­solve the is­sues pre­vi­ously raised by the home buy­ers,” the URA added.</p>
    <p>For the Nor­man­ton Park pro­ject, the de­vel­oper will have to “bud­get at least 12 months to com­plete the Qual­ity Mark as­sess­ment across all 1,862 units”, a spokesman for the Kings­ford Group told ST yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The scope of the as­sess­ment in­cludes the work­man­ship stan­dards of in­ter­nal fin­ishes of the floor­ing, in­ter­nal wall, ceil­ing, door, win­dow and fixtures like wardrobes and kitchen cab­i­nets, among other things. It will also in­clude wa­ter pond­ing tests for the bath­rooms and toi­lets, said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>“There will be in­spec­tion fees, prepara­tory costs and ad­di­tional con­struc­tion costs in­curred to... en­sure ad­her­ence to work­man­ship stan­dards,” the spokesman added.</p>
    <p>Kings­ford Hu­ray, which bought the plot in a col­lec­tive sale in Oc­to­ber 2017 for $830.1 mil­lion, has to fin­ish sell­ing the units by early 2023 or risk in­cur­ring ad­di­tional buyer’s stamp duty (ABSD).</p>
    <p>De­vel­op­ers must sell all units in</p>
    <p>any new pro­ject within five years of buy­ing a site to qual­ify for up­front re­mis­sion of ABSD on the land pur­chase price. If a de­vel­oper fails to do so, it must pay the ABSD, with in­ter­est. The levy was 15 per cent for sites ac­quired from Jan 12, 2013, and this was raised to 25 per cent in July 2018.</p>
    <p>To at­tract early-bird buy­ers and in­cen­tivise agents, Kings­ford Hu­ray is dan­gling car­rots in­clud­ing 10 Mercedes-Benz cars in a lucky draw. Buy­ers of the first 800 units and the agents in­volved will be el­i­gi­ble for the draw.</p>
    <p>Five prop­erty agen­cies – ERA Sin­ga­pore, Hut­tons Asia, OrangeTee & Tie, PropNex and Sin­ga­pore Re­al­tors – have been ap­pointed to mar­ket the mas­sive pro­ject.</p>
