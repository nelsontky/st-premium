    <p>South-east Asian coun­tries should do more to en­cour­age long-term so­lu­tions to cli­mate chal­lenges. Ideas are emerg­ing on how to turn the risk of forest fires into op­por­tu­nity, and mit­i­gate neg­a­tive eco­nomic im­pact through busi­ness in­vest­ment, say writ­ers Si­mon Tay and Meixi Gan of the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of In­ter­na­tional Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>The world last year suf­fered many out­sized fires, which are re­cur­ring this year in the Ama­zon and parts of the United States. This year, South-east Asia has largely been spared the fires and haze that of­ten trou­ble In­done­sia and the re­gion. Yet, there are risks if we are com­pla­cent and con­versely, op­por­tu­ni­ties to be gained if ac­tion is taken.</p>
    <p>Con­sider the rea­son why the haze has not re­turned to our skies – the weather has been un­usu­ally wet, even now, usu­ally the dri­est time of year. Wet­ter con­di­tions re­sult in a sharp fall in forest fires. Burnt area in In­done­sia to­talled 1.65 mil­lion ha last year. But so far this year, from Jan­uary to Septem­ber, only 207,000ha were burned.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, In­done­sian non-gov­ern­ment or­gan­i­sa­tions in­di­cate that the eco­nomic im­pact of the pan­demic has slowed the ex­pan­sion of plan­ta­tion lands, which oth­er­wise of­ten en­tails the use of fire to clear land.</p>
    <p>These fac­tors have led to a re­spite af­ter the se­vere haze last year, but this is more a mat­ter of luck and cir­cum­stances. Con­sider that, as a global av­er­age, this Septem­ber was the hottest ever and that cli­mate change will tend to make fu­ture years still hot­ter. If ef­forts are not re­newed be­fore weather pat­terns worsen, the re­gion will again be prone to fires.</p>
    <p>What needs to be done? Ideas are emerg­ing on how to turn the risk of fires into op­por­tu­nity and mit­i­gate neg­a­tive eco­nomic im­pact through busi­ness in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>DRAWING THE LINKS</p>
    <p>The im­pact of the sea­sonal fires and haze ex­tends be­yond the toll taken on pub­lic health and the economies of In­done­sia and neigh­bour­ing coun­tries. The prob­lem has global and long-term implicatio­ns. Fires are a large-scale re­lease of green­house gases – it is es­ti­mated that In­done­sian forest fires last year were com­pa­ra­ble in terms of emis­sions to a ma­jor in­dus­trial econ­omy such as Ger­many. Bio­di­ver­sity also suf­fers as the ecosys­tems sup­port­ing species unique to the re­gion are lost to mass land clear­ing.</p>
    <p>Pre­vent­ing and man­ag­ing the fires and haze bet­ter can con­trib­ute to global ef­forts to avoid cli­mate change and bio­di­ver­sity loss.</p>
    <p>Forest con­ser­va­tion and restora­tion re­duce green­house gas emis­sions, and help to store and in­crease car­bon stock.</p>
    <p>Take the peat­lands, for in­stance, which dis­pro­por­tion­ately ac­count for the haze and per­sis­tent fires. In­done­sia alone is home to over a third of the world’s trop­i­cal peat forests, which store large amounts of car­bon. Each year, the amount of car­bon emit­ted by South-east Asian peat­lands from degra­da­tion and burn­ing equals to 4 per cent of global fos­sil fuel emis­sions.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts have es­ti­mated that global nat­u­ral ecosys­tems, if pro­tected and re­stored, can pro­vide a full one-third of the emis­sion re­duc­tions needed to meet the Paris cli­mate agree­ment’s goal for 2030. Forest con­ser­va­tion and re­gen­er­a­tion can be a sig­nif­i­cant na­ture-based con­tri­bu­tion to meet­ing the cli­mate chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>FROM RISK TO OP­POR­TU­NITY</p>
    <p>Coun­tries in the re­gion are in­creas­ingly aware of the need to con­serve forests, peat­lands and other sen­si­tive nat­u­ral re­serves. In­done­sia has now made its mora­to­rium on com­mer­cial li­cences for pri­mary forest and peat­land per­ma­nent.</p>
    <p>In March, Viet­nam an­nounced a pro­posed na­tional pro­gramme that would fun­nel pay­ments from the coun­try’s largest car­bon emit­ters to­wards forest con­ser­va­tion ef­forts.</p>
    <p>These are im­por­tant first steps, but pro­tect­ing forests is not just about leav­ing them alone.</p>
    <p>Na­ture-based cli­mate so­lu­tions can be mon­e­tised through the gen­er­a­tion of car­bon cred­its, turn­ing cli­mate risks into busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>A clear busi­ness case must be made to govern­ments and in­vestors.</p>
    <p>Large-scale peat con­ser­va­tion projects are some­times viewed as detri­men­tal to lo­cal com­mu­ni­ties that cul­ti­vate cash crops on the land for their liveli­hoods. Na­ture-based so­lu­tions must there­fore cre­ate value for both the en­vi­ron­ment and lo­cal com­mu­ni­ties. Car­bon cred­its from such projects will be more at­trac­tive to com­pa­nies pur­chas­ing off­sets for their un­avoid­able emis­sions.</p>
    <p>One path-find­ing ex­am­ple is the Rimba Raya Bio­di­ver­sity Re­serve, a peat swamp restora­tion project in Cen­tral Kal­i­man­tan. It is the first in the world to be cer­ti­fied as ad­vanc­ing all 17 United Na­tions (UN) Sus­tain­able Devel­op­ment Goals. The project not only gen­er­ates car­bon cred­its, but also sup­ports wildlife pro­tec­tion as well as lo­cal health and ed­u­ca­tion ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, ef­forts are be­ing taken to strengthen the en­abling en­vi­ron­ment. The In­ter­na­tional Union for Con­ser­va­tion of Na­ture’s Global Stan­dard for Na­ture-based So­lu­tions, launched in July, en­ables prospec­tive donors and in­vestors to bench­mark projects.</p>
    <p>Although the UN Cli­mate Change Con­fer­ence of Par­ties (COP26) has been pushed back due to the pan­demic, work is still on­go­ing to set up rules for a global car­bon mar­ket. Many coun­tries, in­clud­ing In­done­sia, are prepar­ing for that, and are mov­ing to set up a na­tional and even re­gional car­bon emis­sions-trad­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore can ben­e­fit too, even with­out large forests of its own. Sin­ga­pore is po­si­tion­ing it­self as a re­gional car­bon ser­vices hub for the fu­ture, which could in­clude ser­vices sup­port­ing a ro­bust car­bon mar­ket. More com­pa­nies are now mak­ing zero-car­bon pledges, which will in­crease de­mand for car­bon cred­its. Other fi­nan­cial mech­a­nisms such as green bonds may also al­low com­pa­nies in Sin­ga­pore to in­vest in con­ser­va­tion.</p>
    <p>Ob­sta­cles and gaps must be over­come. Many re­late to na­tional laws and sys­tems. One sig­nif­i­cant chal­lenge is to en­sure that prom­ises to set aside forests and other lands are ef­fec­tive, and can be mon­i­tored and ver­i­fied.</p>
    <p>WHAT CAN BE DONE</p>
    <p>There is much that cor­po­ra­tions can and should do. Agribusi­ness and forestry com­pa­nies that op­er­ate in forest and peat­land ar­eas are well placed to help con­serve them. Some of the big­ger and bet­ter com­pa­nies are al­ready set­ting aside ar­eas of high value in con­ser­va­tion and car­bon, while de­vel­op­ing re­main­ing con­ces­sion ar­eas for their pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>Most ma­jor com­pa­nies that op­er­ate in peat­lands have adopted “No De­for­esta­tion, No Peat, No Ex­ploita­tion” (NDPE) poli­cies, com­mit­ting to the pro­tec­tion and sus­tain­able use of these sen­si­tive land­scapes. The com­mit­ments can be re­in­forced by in­vestors who buy into these con­ser­va­tion ef­forts to off­set their car­bon emis­sions.</p>
    <p>Such ef­forts can be as­sisted by gov­ern­ment-to-gov­ern­ment pro­grammes as well. For in­stance, Nor­way has a long­stand­ing com­mit­ment to in­vest US$1 bil­lion (S$1.36 bil­lion) into In­done­sia for schemes to re­duce emis­sions from de­for­esta­tion and land degra­da­tion.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia and the East Malaysian states have clear po­ten­tial to of­fer car­bon projects, in tan­dem with moves to­wards sus­tain­able prac­tices in their forestry and plan­ta­tion sec­tors.</p>
    <p>So does Myan­mar, which has large re­serves of forests and cur­rently is a low emit­ter of green­house gases. This po­ten­tial ex­tends to other ecosys­tems as well, with ef­forts in the Philip­pines and Myan­mar to gen­er­ate car­bon cred­its from man­grove forest restora­tion.</p>
    <p>Of­ten, the fo­cus has been on tech­nol­ogy and in­fra­struc­ture, but govern­ments can pro­mote and pro­tect in­vest­ments in na­ture-based so­lu­tions too. One way would be to set out ap­pro­pri­ate frame­works and rules, with agree­ments to gov­ern and pro­tect in­vest­ments in sus­tain­abil­ity and car­bon cred­its – much as there are treaties for trade, for­eign in­vest­ment, tax and in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty.</p>
    <p>As a think-tank, the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of In­ter­na­tional Af­fairs will con­vene its flag­ship con­fer­ence – the Sin­ga­pore Di­a­logue on Sus­tain­able World Re­sources – next week to ex­plore how the re­gion and part­ners can scale up na­ture con­ser­va­tion and restora­tion to pro­tect ecosys­tems while pro­vid­ing eco­nomic ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>Not all coun­tries in South-east Asia are equally ready to move, and the first pi­lot ef­forts may be be­tween two coun­tries or a sub­set of the re­gion. Even­tu­ally, how­ever, these first movers can con­trib­ute to a re­gional car­bon mar­ket, drawing any rel­e­vant lessons from the Euro­pean Union’s ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>The Asean Com­mu­nity al­ready has eco­nomic, se­cu­rity and so­cio-cul­tural pil­lars, and all coun­tries in the group have made na­tion­ally de­ter­mined con­tri­bu­tions un­der the Paris Agree­ment on cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>Look­ing ahead, our re­gion and key part­ners can work to­wards a “cli­mate com­mu­nity” to as­sess and ad­dress risks, pool ca­pac­ity and draw in in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>The risk that fires and haze will re­turn and worsen in the years ahead re­mains. But our fo­cus on risk must be com­ple­mented by an out­look about the op­por­tu­ni­ties. When the skies are hazy, there is a sense of ur­gency to ad­dress the here-and-now prob­lems; lit­er­ally, fire-fight­ing.</p>
    <p>With this year’s re­spite and rel­a­tively clear skies, the re­gion’s govern­ments, lead­ing com­pa­nies and ex­perts must look fur­ther ahead at the emerg­ing pos­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
