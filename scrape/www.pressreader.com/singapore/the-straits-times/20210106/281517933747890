    <p>It would not be easy to in­ves­ti­gate peo­ple for smok­ing in their own homes, said Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu on Mon­day. Smoke can be smelt even with­out see­ing a smoker.</p>
    <p>En­forc­ing a law against smok­ing near the win­dows and in the bal­conies of homes can­not be com­pared with a probe into the of­fence of a per­son be­ing naked at home while ex­posed to pub­lic view, said Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“One can smell smoke even with­out hav­ing sight of the smoker, nor the abil­ity to pin­point where the smoke is com­ing from,” she ex­plained in a writ­ten re­sponse to a par­lia­men­tary question filed by Mr Louis Ng (Nee Soon GRC).</p>
    <p>“But to im­pose a fine on the smoker, we need ev­i­dence to show the act of smok­ing, not merely the smell of the smoke.”</p>
    <p>Given the cur­rent tech­nol­ogy, it would be chal­leng­ing to track down the smoker or ob­tain ev­i­dence of an act of smok­ing be­ing com­mit­ted with­out rather in­tru­sive meth­ods, Ms Fu said, adding that this would af­fect even the pri­vacy of in­no­cent neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>“And such ef­forts may still be fu­tile if the smoker hides be­hind a pil­lar, frosted glass win­dows or cur­tains to avoid de­tec­tion,” she said.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, a com­plainant would be able to more eas­ily pin­point the lo­ca­tion and cap­ture ev­i­dence of a nude per­son ex­pos­ing him­self or her­self to pub­lic view, to as­sist with in­ves­ti­ga­tion, she added.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng first called for a ban on smok­ing near the win­dows or in the bal­conies of homes early last Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>He said then that while such a move might seem in­tru­sive, there were al­ready laws in place to po­lice peo­ple’s be­hav­iour at home – such as Sec­tion 27A of the Mis­cel­la­neous Of­fences (Pub­lic Or­der and Nui­sance) Act, where one can­not bare it all, even in pri­vate, while ex­posed to pub­lic view.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post at the end of Oc­to­ber, Mr Ng wrote: “Be­ing naked in your own home doesn’t kill your neigh­bour but sec­ond­hand smoke could.”</p>
    <p>But Ms Fu said the fre­quency and na­ture of go­ing in the buff and go­ing for a puff were dif­fer­ent and the two mat­ters should not be com­pared di­rectly.</p>
    <p>Still, she as­sured Mr Ng that tack­ling sec­ond-hand smoke was a pri­or­ity for her min­istry, which is fo­cused on en­cour­ag­ing in­di­vid­u­als to be more so­cially re­spon­si­ble and fa­cil­i­tat­ing con­ver­sa­tions be­tween neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>Ms Fu also noted that smok­ing is pro­hib­ited in more than 32,000 lo­ca­tions here, in­clud­ing cov­ered com­mon ar­eas right up to the doorstep of homes. This in­cludes hawker cen­tres, in view of a longterm plan to tran­si­tion them into com­pletely smoke-free spa­ces, she said in a sep­a­rate writ­ten re­sponse to Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPher­son).</p>
    <p>Since 2015, the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment has re­quired newly built and ren­o­vated hawker cen­tres to be smoke­free. Ms Fu said that as at last month, the num­ber of hawker cen­tres with smok­ing cor­ners had been whit­tled down to 27 out of 114.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency will en­gage the likes of hawk­ers’ as­so­ci­a­tions to pro­gres­sively re­move the re­main­ing smok­ing cor­ners when there are op­por­tu­ni­ties such as dur­ing re­pair works.</p>
    <p>Ms Fu also noted that as of last Oc­to­ber, hawker cen­tres un­der­go­ing the Toi­let Im­prove­ment Pro­gramme (TIP) could get up to 90 per cent fund­ing if they re­move smok­ing cor­ners.</p>
    <p>“I urge town coun­cils to ap­ply for the TIP to up­grade the hawker cen­tre toi­lets and re­scind smok­ing cor­ners at the same time,” she said.</p>
    <p>Given the cur­rent tech­nol­ogy, it would be chal­leng­ing to track down the smoker or ob­tain ev­i­dence of an act of smok­ing be­ing com­mit­ted with­out rather in­tru­sive meth­ods, Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu said, adding that this would af­fect even the pri­vacy of in­no­cent neigh­bours.</p>
