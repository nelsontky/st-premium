    <p>STOCK­HOLM • Amer­i­cans Har­vey Al­ter and Charles Rice to­gether with Bri­ton Michael Houghton have won the Nobel Medicine Prize for the dis­cov­ery of the hepati­tis C virus, paving the way for a cure, the Nobel jury said.</p>
    <p>The three were hon­oured for their “de­ci­sive con­tri­bu­tion to the fight against blood-borne hepati­tis, a ma­jor global health prob­lem that causes cir­rho­sis and liver can­cer in peo­ple around the world”, the jury said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion es­ti­mates there to be 70 mil­lion hepati­tis C in­fec­tions glob­ally, caus­ing around 400,000 deaths each year. It is char­ac­terised by poor ap­petite, vom­it­ing, fa­tigue and jaun­dice.</p>
    <p>Thanks to the trio’s dis­cov­er­ies, highly sen­si­tive blood tests for the virus are now avail­able and these have “es­sen­tially elim­i­nated post­trans­fu­sion hepati­tis in many parts of the world, greatly im­prov­ing global health”, the Nobel com­mit­tee said.</p>
    <p>Their dis­cov­er­ies al­lowed the rapid de­vel­op­ment of an­tivi­ral drugs di­rected at hepati­tis C.</p>
    <p>“For the first time in his­tory, the dis­ease can now be cured, rais­ing hopes of erad­i­cat­ing hepati­tis C virus from the world pop­u­la­tion,” the jury said.</p>
    <p>Dr Al­ter, 85, told Swedish Ra­dio he was stunned to re­ceive an ear­ly­morn­ing call from the com­mit­tee, say­ing it was “mind- bog­gling”.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t even re­alise this was the day the Nobel Prizes were go­ing to be given out,” he added.</p>
    <p>“To see so many peo­ple get cured is as­tound­ing,” he told the Nobel Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>Prior to the trio’s work, the dis­cov­ery of the hepati­tis A and B viruses had been crit­i­cal steps for­ward – the dis­cov­ery of hepati­tis B won the Nobel Medicine Prize in 1976 – but the ma­jor­ity of blood-borne hepati­tis cases re­mained un­ex­plained.</p>
    <p>The dis­cov­ery of the hepati­tis C virus re­vealed the cause of the re­main­ing cases of chronic hepati­tis, and “made pos­si­ble blood tests and new medicines that have saved mil­lions of lives”, the Nobel com­mit­tee said.</p>
    <p>Dr Al­ter was cred­ited for his pi­o­neer­ing work study­ing the oc­cur­rence of hepati­tis in pa­tients who had re­ceived blood trans­fu­sions, de­ter­min­ing that their ill­ness was nei­ther hepati­tis A or B.</p>
    <p>Dr Houghton built on Dr Al­ter’s work to iso­late the ge­netic se­quence of the new virus. Dr Rice, 68, sub­se­quently com­pleted the puz­zle by us­ing ge­netic en­gi­neer­ing to prove that it was the new strain alone – hepati­tis C – that was caus­ing pa­tients to get sick.</p>
    <p>The trio will share the prize sum of 10 mil­lion Swedish kro­nor (S$1.5 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>Dr Houghton, Dr Al­ter and Dr Rice would, in nor­mal times, be re­ceiv­ing their prize from King Carl XVI Gustaf at a for­mal cer­e­mony in Stock­holm on Dec 10, the an­niver­sary of the 1896 death of scientist Al­fred Nobel who cre­ated the prizes in his will.</p>
    <p>But the in-per­son cer­e­mony has been can­celled this year due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and re­placed with a tele­vised event show­ing the lau­re­ates re­ceiv­ing their awards in their home coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The 2020 Nobel sea­son con­tin­ues to­day with the physics prize, with as­tro­physi­cists Shep Doele­man of the US and Ger­many’s Heino Fal­cke seen as pos­si­ble win­ners for work that led to the first di­rectly ob­served im­age of a black hole in April 2019.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can math­e­ma­ti­cian Peter Shor, who paved the way for to­day’s re­search on quan­tum com­put­ers, or France’s Alain As­pect for his work on quan­tum en­tan­gle­ment, have also been men­tioned.</p>
    <p>The chem­istry and lit­er­a­ture prizes fol­low on to­mor­row and Thurs­day. Spec­u­la­tion ahead of Fri­day’s peace prize has, mean­while, fo­cused on press free­dom groups, Swedish teenager Greta Thun­berg and other cli­mate ac­tivists, or sev­eral UN or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>The eco­nomics prize will wrap things up next Mon­day.</p>
