    <p>When de­scrib­ing my stay at One Far­rer Ho­tel to friends, I found my­self mix­ing up the words “ho­tel” and “hos­pi­tal” very of­ten.</p>
    <p>Per­haps it is the five-star ho­tel’s lo­ca­tion – right next to One Far­rer Hos­pi­tal, to which it is af­fil­i­ated. Hos­pi­tal ex­perts were also con­sulted in the re­cently com­pleted $2 mil­lion re­fur­bish­ment of 70 per cent of the ho­tel – or 176 rooms – that fall un­der the Mint cat­e­gory of rooms at One Far­rer.</p>
    <p>Or per­haps it is the quiet, hos­pi­tal-like hall­ways that lead to my Sky­line room on the 19th floor, which over­looks the bustling Far­rer Park neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>In the pur­suit of clean­li­ness, no de­tail has been spared. Car­pets, which are a hot­bed for germs and pathogens, have been re­moved from all Mint cat­e­gory rooms and com­mon ar­eas in favour of vinyl floor­ing for ease of clean­ing.</p>
    <p>As the la­bel “mint” evokes, there is a fresh­ness and clean­li­ness about the rooms, where ev­ery­thing from the win­dow blinds (an­timi­cro­bial fab­rics) to the paint on the walls (an­ti­fun­gal) have prob­a­bly helped the ho­tel earn that cov­eted SG Clean qual­ity mark.</p>
    <p>I get a demon­stra­tion of how gue­strooms are fur­ther sani­tised dur­ing house­keep­ing with the lat­est tech­nol­ogy – an Ul­tra­vi­o­let-C (UVC) lamp that looks like a blue light-emit­ting de­vice straight out of sci­ence-fic­tion tele­vi­sion se­ries Doc­tor Who. It is placed in the room undis­turbed for 15 min­utes to kill all the re­main­ing pathogens.</p>
    <p>There is also a UVC chest in which tar­geted ster­il­i­sa­tion is done for high touch­point items such as re­mote con­trols.</p>
    <p>With Covid-19 still an on­go­ing con­cern, the Mint ho­tel rooms are a clean freak’s dream – if that is the peace of mind you are look­ing for.</p>
    <p>But I find my pre­vi­ously nonex­is­tent ger­mo­pho­bia height­ened, know­ing that I am in such a ster­ile en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>I crave the warmth and lux­ury of the car­pets un­der­foot at the Nest at One Far­rer, where I had a sump­tu­ous, be­spoke pri­vate din­ing ex­pe­ri­ence ear­lier that day.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the pub­lic can also book and cus­tomise gourmet meals at the newly launched Nest in one of the ho­tel’s Pres­i­den­tial Vil­las. About 30 per cent of the ho­tel, in­clud­ing the vil­las and loft apart­ments, re­mains in­tact with all the frills such as car­pets and chan­de­liers.</p>
    <p>With room ser­vice end­ing by 9.30pm and the lounge mostly full through­out the day be­cause of safedis­tanc­ing mea­sures, it is prob­a­bly best to take ad­van­tage of the plethora of au­then­tic food op­tions in the area – whether it is the fa­mous</p>
    <p>Nor­ris Road cha­p­ati or a de­lec­ta­ble briyani set from Mr Biryani, both a 10-minute walk away.</p>
    <p>You are also a skip and a hop away from 24-hour shop­ping at Sin­ga­porean stal­wart Mustafa Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>With over­seas travel still not on the cards, the ho­tel – which has sev­eral stays el­i­gi­ble for Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers Vouch­ers – proves a good home base from which to re­dis­cover the cul­tural rich­ness of the neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>One of its stay­ca­tion pack­ages, A Walk in the Far­rer Park, in­cludes a two-hour Se­crets of Jalan Be­sar guided tour, where you weave in and out of back al­leys with stun­ning mu­rals and learn about the colo­nial and sport­ing past of neigh­bour­hoods like Race Course Road.</p>
    <p>Though parts of the tour give me flash­backs to com­pul­sory na­tional ed­u­ca­tion tours I did in pri­mary school, there are hid­den gems, like a serene, Ti­betan-style tem­ple called Thekchen Chol­ing I had never no­ticed be­fore on my vis­its to cof­fee joint Chye Seng Huat Hard­ware.</p>
    <p>Per­haps a ho­tel-and-hos­pi­tal hy­brid – or “hospi-tel” – is the new nor­mal for hos­pi­tal­ity, not just in Sin­ga­pore but glob­ally.</p>
    <p>The ho­tel’s ded­i­ca­tion to steril­ity will prob­a­bly ap­peal to those wary of stay­ca­tions, but I pre­fer a lit­tle more in­dul­gence – car­pets and all – in my ho­tel stay.</p>
