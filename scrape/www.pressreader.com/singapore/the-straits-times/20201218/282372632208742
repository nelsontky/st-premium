    <p>•</p>
    <p>Ar­se­nal man­ager Mikel Arteta was dis­ap­pointed with his team’s 1-1 Premier League draw against Southamp­ton on Wed­nes­day, although he ac­knowl­edged it was a de­cent re­sult af­ter go­ing down to 10 men on the hour.</p>
    <p>The Gun­ners last won a league game at the Emi­rates on Oct 4 and hav­ing lost their last four at home, they nearly snatched a win­ner when Rob Hold­ing hit the cross­bar in stop­page time.</p>
    <p>But their win­less run has now stretched to six league games, leav­ing Arteta to rue Gabriel’s red card for a sec­ond book­able foul when he hauled down Theo Wal­cott, who opened the scor­ing against his for­mer team.</p>
    <p>The hosts ap­peared to be in the as­cen­dancy af­ter Pierre Em­er­ick­Aubameyang equalised with just his third league goal of the sea­son and his first from open play since Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the sev­enth red card since Arteta’s ap­point­ment – four more than any team in the league – ru­ined any mo­men­tum, forc­ing the team to set­tle for the draw.</p>
    <p>“Very dis­ap­pointed be­cause in that mo­ment, I was think­ing to change the cen­tre-back straight away – we didn’t even have time to do that,” Arteta told the BBC.</p>
    <p>“In the end, we got a point that con­sid­er­ing the cir­cum­stances, we have to ac­cept. The boys came out like we did three days ago, we scored a re­ally good goal, on top in the game, and again, we shoot our­selves in the foot.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter­wards, Aubameyang ad­mit­ted the mood at the club was not good, con­tribut­ing to the team mak­ing rash and costly de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>“A bit dis­ap­pointed, we could win this game, some­times this hap­pens,” he said. “We are a bit ner­vous, we need points. Some­times, we do bad things but this hap­pens when you need points, we have to stay cool with the head.”</p>
    <p>The Saints had been gun­ning for their first league vic­tory at Ar­se­nal since 1987 and while they could not ex­tend the Gun­ners’ los­ing run, man­ager Ralph Hasen­huttl felt his play­ers have proven they no longer have an in­fe­ri­or­ity com­plex when play­ing against sup­pos­edly big­ger teams.</p>
    <p>“I am OK with a point,” he said. “Teams have re­spect for what we are do­ing and how we are play­ing. We have shown what we have learnt in the past and that is to play our game. We get more and more con­fi­dent play­ing in pos­ses­sion.”</p>
    <p>Wal­cott agreed, adding: “Ar­se­nal are in a dif­fi­cult time but in the end, it is dis­ap­point­ing to take a point and it shows how far this club has come, we know how good we are as a unit.”</p>
    <p>Else­where, Leeds won a se­v­en­goal thriller, beat­ing New­cas­tle 5-2 for their first vic­tory at El­land Road in three months.</p>
