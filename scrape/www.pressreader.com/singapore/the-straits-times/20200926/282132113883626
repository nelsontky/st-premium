    <p>There is no need to worry about ro­bots and ma­chines re­plac­ing hu­mans or whether peo­ple can learn to beat com­put­ers.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the way for­ward for to­mor­row’s work­ers is to dou­ble down on hu­man strengths, said Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, ro­bots and com­put­ers will never be able to think cre­atively, have face-to-face con­ver­sa­tions, brain­storm, chal­lenge one an­other or come up with so­lu­tions as a team, he added.</p>
    <p>Spon­ta­neous “so­cial learn­ing” is also some­thing ma­chines will not be able to do, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong was speak­ing yes­ter­day at a di­a­logue on the fu­ture of jobs and skills for Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Join­ing him on the panel were the five may­ors: Ms Low Yen Ling (South West District), Ms Denise Phua (Cen­tral Sin­ga­pore District), Mr Des­mond Choo (North East District), Mr Alex Yam (North West District) and Mr Fahmi Ali­man (South East District).</p>
    <p>Said Mr Wong: “Peo­ple start think­ing, ‘What should I do to be bet­ter to­day? Should I learn more pro­gram­ming, cod­ing, IT? I think all of th­ese are im­por­tant skill sets. We need to bet­ter un­der­stand tech­nol­ogy so that we can work well with ma­chines... but we do not have to learn how to be bet­ter com­put­ers to beat the com­puter.</p>
    <p>“The way for­ward is for us to dou­ble down on our hu­man strengths... It’s not to be taken for granted that hu­man soft skills are nat­u­ral and in­nate, and that ev­ery­one can do it well. We need to prac­tise and get bet­ter at it.”</p>
    <p>Ms Phua said not all fu­ture skills have to be tech-re­lated – emerg­ing sec­tors like el­der­care and dis­abil­ity care are not nec­es­sar­ily tech­heavy.</p>
    <p>She said: “Most of us feel like all the jobs of the fu­ture have to do with tech­nol­ogy, and that’s why the main words we hear to­day are ‘data an­a­lyt­ics’ and ‘cy­ber se­cu­rity’.”</p>
    <p>But there are other jobs, such as in health­care, that will fo­cus on care mod­els or the process of car­ing for pa­tients, with tech­nol­ogy used more for com­mu­ni­ca­tion pur­poses, Ms Phua added.</p>
    <p>Mr Choo touched on how fresh grad­u­ates and young job seek­ers should be ready to adapt. He said: “Changes are quite rapid. But the sil­ver lin­ing we have seen is that work­ers who are pre­pared to make changes and adapt, and will­ing to get re­trained... gen­er­ally do find that get­ting a job is much eas­ier.”</p>
    <p>The di­a­logue was held af­ter a mem­o­ran­dum of un­der­stand­ing was signed be­tween Ms Low, Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore chief ex­ec­u­tive Ong Tze Ch’in and Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute chief ex­ec­u­tive Gil­bert Tan. Ms Low was rep­re­sent­ing the five Com­mu­nity De­vel­op­ment Coun­cils (CDCs).</p>
    <p>The three-year agree­ment, which will run un­til Au­gust 2023, aims to pro­vide Sin­ga­pore­ans with in­for­ma­tion on Skill­sFu­ture pro­grammes and how to tap var­i­ous re­sources for ca­reer plan­ning and up­grad­ing.</p>
    <p>Since the Skill­sFu­ture Ad­vice ini­tia­tive was launched in 2017, more than 110,000 peo­ple have at­tended over 4,300 Skill­sFu­ture Ad­vice work­shops.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the agen­cies also said Skill­sFu­ture@CDC 2020 – a vir­tual event of­fer­ing ca­reer work­shops and a guide to re­sources for skills train­ing – will be ex­tended.</p>
    <p>It was ini­tially con­ceived as a week-long event from Aug 10 to 16. In that time, it at­tracted more than 257,000 par­tic­i­pants, and has now been ex­tended to next July.</p>
    <p>The event, or­gan­ised by the five CDCs, in­cludes work­shops to help res­i­dents bet­ter un­der­stand the job mar­ket and skill trends amid the pan­demic, and live chats with ex­perts from var­i­ous in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>Ms Low said: “Our priority (with Skill­sFu­ture Ad­vice) is to ex­pe­dite job search op­por­tu­ni­ties and ramp up pro­grammes and ini­tia­tives to meet the grow­ing de­mand for up­skilling and reskilling.”</p>
    <p>Later, at a di­a­logue or­gan­ised by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic</p>
    <p>Pol­icy, Mr Wong ad­dressed a range of is­sues, such as en­cour­ag­ing a more mul­ti­dis­ci­plinary ap­proach to learn­ing at ter­tiary in­sti­tu­tions and boost­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for stu­dents from low-in­come homes.</p>
    <p>He said the uni­ver­si­ties, poly­tech­nics and In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion are re­view­ing their cur­ric­ula. “In the real world, many is­sues are com­plex and cut across dif­fer­ent dis­ci­plines. They can­not be solved by an en­gi­neer alone or ar­chi­tect or sci­en­tist. Dif­fer­ent skill sets need to come to­gether.”</p>
    <p>Live-streamed on Face­book, the di­a­logue, called Af­ter The Pan­demic: Reimag­in­ing Ed­u­ca­tion, was the fourth in a se­ries and sup­ported by the Sin­ga­pore Global Net­work.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong also spoke on how the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry is find­ing more ways to level up op­por­tu­ni­ties for stu­dents from dis­ad­van­taged back­grounds. “We put in more re­sources to schools with a higher pro­por­tion of stu­dents with greater learn­ing needs, as well as those who come from fam­i­lies with lower in­comes.”</p>
