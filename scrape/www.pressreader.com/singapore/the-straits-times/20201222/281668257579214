    <p>Seven in 10 em­ploy­ers in­tend to hire work­ers with broader skill sets in the fu­ture, a re­cent sur­vey showed.</p>
    <p>Re­sults from the NTUC Learn­ingHub’s sur­vey were pub­lished yes­ter­day as part of a re­port which noted that al­most all em­ploy­ers agreed there that there was a greater need for em­ploy­ees able to take on hy­brid roles.</p>
    <p>About 72 per cent of those polled also cited dif­fi­cul­ties in fill­ing va­cant roles in their com­pa­nies, amid dis­rup­tions be­cause of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey was con­ducted on­line in Oc­to­ber with 367 busi­ness lead­ers and 567 full-time em­ploy­ees across six ma­jor in­dus­try clus­ters, in­clud­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing as well as trade and con­nec­tiv­ity, to eval­u­ate the pan­demic’s im­pact on them.</p>
    <p>Around 80 per cent of the re­spon­dents were from the pri­vate sec­tor.</p>
    <p>About 69 per cent of em­ploy­ees in the sur­vey said that they have had to adopt new skills in their daily work, while about 71 per cent said they felt an ur­gency to up­skill and reskill to re­main com­pet­i­tive in the job mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, the vast ma­jor­ity of em­ploy­ers – 84 per cent – said it was nec­es­sary for em­ploy­ees to pick up new skills due to changes to their busi­nesses as a re­sult of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers sin­gled out the three most valu­able sup­ple­men­tary skills for em­ploy­ees in the hy­brid role – ef­fec­tive com­mu­ni­ca­tion, team­work or col­lab­o­ra­tion, and data anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>They also noted that the top three adap­tive skills that work­ers lacked were in­no­va­tion, an­a­lyt­i­cal rea­son­ing and com­plex prob­lem-solv­ing, and cre­ativ­ity.</p>
    <p>About half of the work­ers polled said that they had up­graded their skills in the last six months to keep them­selves com­pet­i­tive in the work­place or over­all job mar­ket.</p>
    <p>But 74 per cent of them wished their com­pa­nies pro­vided more sup­port in skills up­grad­ing.</p>
    <p>NTUC Learn­ingHub chair­man Eu­gene Wong said: “In a world where we are in a con­stant state of change, we can­not re­main sin­gle-tracked when it comes to our ca­reers.</p>
    <p>“To nav­i­gate the new norm and seek op­por­tu­ni­ties, it is key to stay in­formed about the lat­est jobs and skills in de­mand, then take ac­tion by up­skilling for em­ployer-cov­eted hy­brid roles and sup­ple­men­tary skills.”</p>
    <p>He added that there would in­evitably be shifts in skills in de­mand as the busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment trans­forms.</p>
    <p>“To fu­ture-proof your em­ploy­a­bil­ity, stay open for mul­ti­ple ca­reer path­ways by con­stantly up­skilling or even reskilling to re­main ready, rel­e­vant and re­silient in chal­leng­ing times,” Mr Wong said.</p>
