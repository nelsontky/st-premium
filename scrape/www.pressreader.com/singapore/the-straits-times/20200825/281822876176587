    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son has urged par­ents to send their chil­dren back to schools when they re­open next week, amid grow­ing con­cern among some teach­ers and union of­fi­cials that it is not safe to do so.</p>
    <p>“Now is the time to get pupils back into school, give them the chances they need to build the nec­es­sary bedrock for their aca­demic fu­tures,” Mr John­son said in a video re­leased yes­ter­day on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>“The risk of con­tract­ing Covid-19 in school is very small and it is far more dam­ag­ing for a child’s devel­op­ment and their health and well­be­ing to be away from school any longer,” Mr John­son said.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents were sent home in the coro­n­avirus chaos of mid-March, and most have not been back since.</p>
    <p>Get­ting stu­dents back to school would give par­ents a chance to re­turn to their work­places, which the govern­ment is en­cour­ag­ing to help the econ­omy re­cover from its record 20 per cent con­trac­tion in the sec­ond quar­ter. And with Mr John­son’s govern­ment reel­ing from a suc­ces­sion of blun­ders in deal­ing with the pan­demic, the stakes are high to get school re­open­ing right.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s chief med­i­cal of­fi­cers said on Sun­day t hat the Covid-19 fa­tal­ity rate among those aged five to 14 is lower than most sea­sonal flu in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>There is an “ex­cep­tion­ally small risk” of pri­mary or sec­ondary school-age chil­dren dy­ing from coro­n­avirus if it is con­tracted, they said.</p>
    <p>But the govern­ment can­not af­ford any mis­steps, with pub­lic trust run­ning low over its han­dling of the exam grad­ing fi­asco i n re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>A spike in in­fec­tions that forces schools to close would likely fur­ther hurt Mr John­son’s Con­ser­va­tives at the polls.</p>
