    <p>When the Hun­gry Ghost Fes­ti­val rolls around next month, you will not be able to catch the colour­ful sights and sounds of getai in your neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>But you can en­joy the shows – held for the spir­its that are said to roam the earthly realm dur­ing the sev­enth lu­nar month – on­line.</p>
    <p>Lively auc­tion din­ners, an­other fes­ti­val sta­ple, will make way for silent auc­tions. The fes­ti­val takes place this year from Aug 19 to Sept 16.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan Thiam Lye, 70, hon­orary sec­re­tary of the Lorong Koo Chye Sheng Hong Tem­ple As­so­ci­a­tion, says it has had to adapt its prac­tices to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The tem­ple in Aru­mugam Road launched an on­line devo­tee man­age­ment sys­tem on July 5, al­low­ing wor­ship­pers to give do­na­tions, send bless­ing lights and pur­chase re­li­gious of­fer­ings re­motely.</p>
    <p>As for the Hun­gry Ghost Fes­ti­val, Mr Tan, who is also chair­man of the Taoist Fed­er­a­tion, says in Man­darin: “We usu­ally have fes­tiv­i­ties like buf­fets and getai for a few days, but those are not pos­si­ble this year.</p>
    <p>“In­stead, the tem­ple will hold a silent auc­tion for eight aus­pi­cious items on Sept 2. Devo­tees can drop their bids in boxes.”</p>
    <p>Getai or­gan­iser Aaron Tan, says he has so far firmed up plans to stage 10 on­line getai gigs dur­ing the Hun­gry Ghost Fes­ti­val. It is not the first time the 44-year-old di­rec­tor of Lex(S) En­ter­tain­ment Pro­duc­tions is putting on vir­tual getai shows.</p>
    <p>He started live-stream­ing his shows in 2016. His pro­duc­tion com­pany has also been stag­ing getai shows in stu­dios and putting the per­for­mances up on­line since March 30.</p>
    <p>His shows garner 80,000 views on av­er­age on Face­book and YouTube.</p>
    <p>At Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery, Sin­ga­pore’s largest Bud­dhist tem­ple, an­nual prayers for the sev­enth lu­nar month, also known as the Ul­lam­bana Fes­ti­val, will be done be­hind closed doors this year, a spokesman says. Mem­bers of the pub­lic are not al­lowed to at­tend the ses­sion, which typ­i­cally at­tracts thou­sands of devo­tees.</p>
    <p>Since the tem­ple in Sin Ming re­opened for pub­lic wor­ship on July 1, wor­ship­pers have had to book slots via an on­line sys­tem be­fore vis­it­ing. The slots, in hourly blocks, are snapped up quickly.</p>
    <p>There are plans for some classes for its devo­tees to be moved on­line as well, such as weekly med­i­ta­tion classes by its Ven­er­a­ble Chuan Hang, which will be held via video­con­fer­enc­ing plat­form Zoom from Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, Bud­dhist tem­ple Thekchen Chol­ing (Sin­ga­pore) in Laven­der is do­ing its best to go con­tact­less and on­line, says act­ing chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Em­me­line Ang.</p>
    <p>It held an on­line re­li­gious re­treat over a week­end l ast month to chant a prayer 100,000 times and about 400 peo­ple signed up.</p>
    <p>“We would usu­ally at­tract only about 200 peo­ple if the re­treat was held in Malaysia or at the Sin­ga­pore Expo,” Ms Ang says.</p>
    <p>Dharma lessons for chil­dren and youth and med­i­ta­tion classes for adults are con­ducted over Zoom. There are also weekly dharma teach­ings and daily morn­ing prayer sessions streamed on­line via Face­book Live. These ef­forts, she notes, are likely to con­tinue af­ter Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Ms Ang says: “I think it helps us en­gage with fol­low­ers here and over­seas, since not ev­ery­one can make it to the tem­ple each morn­ing for prayers.”</p>
    <p>The tem­ple is look­ing at phys­i­cal changes as well, she adds. Due to lim­ited space, only seven peo­ple are al­lowed into the main hall at one time, al­though up to 50 wor­ship­pers are al­lowed for re­li­gious ser­vice un­der pan­demic mea­sures.</p>
    <p>A gantry en­try and exit sys­tem has been im­ple­mented, and the draw­ing of div­ina­tion sticks was stopped to min­imise sur­face con­tact.</p>
    <p>Ms Ang says: “Mov­ing for­ward, we hope that the ex­change of money can be con­tact­less and we can maybe use PayWave, QR codes.</p>
    <p>“We’re also think­ing of in­no­va­tive ways to make ser­vices like the draw­ing of div­ina­tion sticks elec­tronic. Per­haps through a vend­ing ma­chine?”</p>
    <p>But some devo­tees still pre­fer in-per­son wor­ship.</p>
    <p>Mr Low Hao Rong, 49, a pri­mary school teacher who has been go­ing to Thekchen Chol­ing (Sin­ga­pore) for about a decade, at­tended its on­line re­treat last month and is part of a devo­tee-ini­ti­ated prayer and chant­ing ses­sion that takes place ev­ery Satur­day on Zoom.</p>
    <p>“Tech­nol­ogy is good for con­nect­ing and can do so with more peo­ple. How­ever, I pre­fer phys­i­cal in­ter­ac­tion with other devo­tees to</p>
    <p>build stronger re­la­tion­ships, as well as pray­ing and per­form­ing ri­tu­als in the tem­ple. It gives me a sense of be­long­ing.”</p>
    <p>Ms Michelle Trisno, 22, a dig­i­tal mar­keter in the e-com­merce in­dus­try who vis­its Bud­dhist tem­ples like Man­gala Vi­hara in Eunos and Wat Ananda Met­yarama in Bukit Merah, be­lieves that e-wor­ship should con­tinue af­ter the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The co-founder of memor.co – an In­sta­gram and Face­book group which aims to raise aware­ness about Bud­dhism and its prin­ci­ples to youth – also helped to or­gan­ise an e-Ve­sak Day count­down in May on Zoom and Face­book as part of the or­gan­is­ing team of Bud­dhist Youth Net­work, a non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion. When about 3,000 peo­ple tuned in, she was pleas­antly sur­prised.</p>
    <p>“It’s hard to get 3,000 peo­ple in one tem­ple for ac­tual Ve­sak fes­tiv­i­ties,” she says. “It will be good for tem­ples to do both phys­i­cal and e-wor­ship ser­vices be­cause they can reach so many more peo­ple.”</p>
