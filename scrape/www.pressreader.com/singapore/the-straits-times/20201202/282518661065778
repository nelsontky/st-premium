    <p>For the first time in months, sport has come alive on lo­cal shores. There will not be a day with­out live sport this week, with at least seven events tak­ing place, al­beit un­der strict mea­sures to curb the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>In this ac­tion-packed week, ju­nior golfers are back in the swing of things at the EFG Sin­ga­pore Ju­nior Mas­ters, there are Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL) matches as the ti­tle race goes down to the wire, and swim­mers are gun­ning for an Olympic spot at the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Olympic Qual­i­fiers.</p>
    <p>Other events in­clude the Marigold Na­tional Squash Cham­pi­onships, Stan­dard Char­tered Sin­ga­pore Marathon’s vir­tual races and grand fi­nale, mixed mar­tial arts pro­mo­tion One Cham­pi­onship’s Big Bang and the Ac­tiveSG x Foot Locker 2v2 Bas­ket­ball Tour­na­ment. If all goes well, this could be what the fu­ture holds for the lo­cal sports scene.</p>
    <p>Na­tional squash player Sa­muel Kang’s first com­pe­ti­tion back in al­most a year was a very dif­fer­ent ex­pe­ri­ence from what he is used to.</p>
    <p>Apart from the manda­tory SafeEn­try check-ins and tem­per­a­ture tak­ing, par­tic­i­pants in na­tional cham­pi­onships can only en­ter the venue, Kal­lang Squash Cen­tre, 15 min­utes be­fore the match.</p>
    <p>“I feel like they’re do­ing ev­ery­thing they can to make sure it’s safe,” Kang, 29, who is the men’s open top seed, said of or­gan­is­ers.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully it will all go smoothly and other sports can also re­sume hav­ing com­pe­ti­tions and events.”</p>
    <p>Among the Covid-19 pro­to­cols for the tour­na­ment are the fre­quent sani­ti­sa­tion of equip­ment and courts, with courts cleaned daily and touch points such as door knobs and the glass back wall wiped with sani­tiser hourly.</p>
    <p>The other events tak­ing place also have strict mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>Un­like pre­vi­ous years’ swim meets that had about 700 par­tic­i­pants, the Olympic qual­i­fiers, which will be held from to­mor­row to Sun­day, will see about 300 swim­mers com­pet­ing behind closed doors. The num­ber of of­fi­cials has also been cut from 30 to 14 and they will be re­quired to wear a mask at all times while ob­serv­ing a 1m dis­tance be­tween each other.</p>
    <p>The safe man­age­ment mea­sures for the EFG Sin­ga­pore Ju­nior Mas­ters, which started yes­ter­day and will end to­mor­row, in­clude a sin­gle-bar­rel, one-tee start and no re­moval of flag­sticks.</p>
    <p>Three Hong Kong play­ers who</p>
    <p>were sup­posed to travel here within the Hong Kong-Sin­ga­pore travel bub­ble were un­able to af­ter the ar­range­ment was post­poned.</p>
    <p>Na­tional golfer Shan­non Tan, 16, said: “I really looked for­ward to play­ing com­pet­i­tive golf, stand­ing on the first tee and feel­ing that type of pres­sure. The thing that stood out for me was hav­ing the flag­stick in at all times when putting as it af­fects my line of sight.”</p>
    <p>HIGH TIME FOR EAS­ING</p>
    <p>With the num­ber of com­mu­nity trans­mis­sions in Sin­ga­pore ex­tremely low in the past month, in­fec­tious disease ex­perts The Straits Times spoke to be­lieve it is the right time to start al­low­ing more live sports events to re­sume.</p>
    <p>Dr Piotr Ch­lebicki, an in­fec­tious diseases spe­cial­ist at Mount Alver­nia Hos­pi­tal, said: “It’s not a dif­fi­cult de­ci­sion to al­low sports events na­tion­ally... It’s high time to re­lease the re­stric­tions slowly in­ter­nally, but we’re not ready for in­ter­na­tional events or spec­ta­tors yet.”</p>
    <p>While most of the live sports events this week do not re­quire ath</p>
    <p>letes and of­fi­cials to un­dergo test­ing, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Alex Cook, vice-dean of re­search at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, sug­gested con­sid­er­ing test­ing ath­letes be­fore events now that rapid tests such as the anti­gen rapid tests (ARTs) are more avail­able and af­ford­able.</p>
    <p>He also rec­om­mended pri­ori­tis­ing test­ing ath­letes in sports that in­volve more phys­i­cal con­tact such as rugby and mar­tial arts “given the risk of droplet-based spread”. He added: “Right now, the risk in the com­mu­nity is ex­tremely low, so this is a good time to start ex­per­i­ment­ing with safe ways to get us watch­ing and do­ing sports.”</p>
    <p>SAFE RESTART SO FAR</p>
    <p>Be­fore this week, live sports events that were given the goa­head by au­thor­i­ties, mainly events by One and the SPL, had not en­coun­tered ma­jor prob­lems.</p>
    <p>Be­fore One’s In­side the Ma­trix event on Oct 30, two cor­ner­men tested pos­i­tive, but the event took place with the duo kept out of it. An­other cor­ner­man tested posi</p>
    <p>tive ahead of Fri­day’s Big Bang event at the Sin­ga­pore In­door Sta­dium, but the event is to go on.</p>
    <p>Pro­to­cols for the event, which can have up to 250 fans in at­ten­dance, in­clude the re­quire­ment for all for­eign-based ath­letes, cor­ner­men and staff to be iso­lated un­til they re­ceive a neg­a­tive test re­sult, af­ter which they will fol­low a strictly con­trolled itin­er­ary that has been pre-ap­proved.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the SPL re­sumed on Oct 17, 223 play­ers and of­fi­cials were tested and they have been un­der­go­ing fort­nightly swabs with­out any pos­i­tives.</p>
    <p>On sports re­turn­ing, Sport Sin­ga­pore chief ex­ec­u­tive Lim Teck Yin said: “The grad­ual re­sump­tion of sport­ing ac­tiv­i­ties and com­pe­ti­tions is made pos­si­ble through the col­lab­o­ra­tive ef­fort of the whole sport­ing com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“We are very proud to have reached this mile­stone and en­cour­age ev­ery­one to keep up the good work.”</p>
