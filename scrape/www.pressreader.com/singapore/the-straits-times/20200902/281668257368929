    <p>More Sin­ga­pore­ans are hold­ing se­nior roles in the fi­nan­cial sec­tor and there is no sign they are at risk of los­ing out, said Trans­port Min­is­ter and Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) board mem­ber Ong Ye Kung.</p>
    <p>And de­spite con­cerns over the num­bers, for­eign­ers play an im­por­tant role in the sec­tor and bring ben­e­fits to Sin­ga­pore be­cause it is not a “zero-sum game”, he added.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in Par­lia­ment on the se­cond day of the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress yes­ter­day, Mr Ong ad­dressed con­cerns about the share of for­eign man­power in the fi­nan­cial ser­vices sec­tor and drilled down into the de­tails of the is­sue.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the num­ber of Sin­ga­pore­ans hold­ing se­nior jobs in the fi­nan­cial sec­tor rose by more than 50 per cent from 2014 to last year.</p>
    <p>In 2014, there were 1,700 Sin­ga­pore­ans hold­ing such top-level po­si­tions – man­ag­ing di­rec­tor and above. The num­ber grew to 2,600 last year, said Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>“That is more than a 50 per cent in­crease in five years, or an ad­di­tional 900 Sin­ga­pore­ans tak­ing up se­nior roles, em­bark­ing on a new and ful­fill­ing stage in their ca­reers,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to MAS es­ti­mates, said Mr Ong, the to­tal num­ber of se­nior po­si­tions in the fi­nan­cial ser­vices sec­tor grew from 3,900 in 2014 to 5,900 last year.</p>
    <p>While the pro­por­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans in these roles has held steady – at about 44 per cent – their ab­so­lute num­bers have in­creased. “This is be­cause we have grown as a fi­nan­cial cen­tre, the base has ex­panded sig­nif­i­cantly. So, same share but of a grow­ing base,” he said.</p>
    <p>Last year, Sin­ga­pore­ans ac­counted for about 70 per cent of se­nior man­age­ment roles in re­tail banks’ lo­cal func­tions. In non-re­tail banks, where there is a higher con­cen­tra­tion of re­gional and global func­tions, the pro­por­tion is lower, at about 40 per cent, he said.</p>
    <p>“But this does not mean that Sin­ga­pore­ans are get­ting the short end of the stick be­cause this is not a zero-sum game,” Mr Ong added.</p>
    <p>When banks bring their func­tions over here, Sin­ga­pore­ans also gain pre­cious global and re­gional ex­per­tise, which “com­ple­ments over­seas as­sign­ments and ex­po­sure, which are key to pre­par­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans to as­sume se­nior man­age­ment roles in global firms”.</p>
    <p>As for un­fair hir­ing prac­tices in the sec­tor, Mr Ong made clear there is no place for that here.</p>
    <p>“MAS holds our fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to high stan­dards and will not con­done firms that fall short of fair hir­ing prac­tices,” he said.</p>
    <p>An­other con­cern, Mr Ong said, was the high con­cen­tra­tion of one na­tion­al­ity in the tech­nol­ogy de­part­ments of fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>MAS has stepped up en­gage­ment with the top lead­er­ship of key fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions on the need to main­tain “ro­bust HR prac­tices that are merit-based and sup­port work­place di­ver­sity”, he added.</p>
    <p>The fi­nan­cial ser­vices sec­tor – which Mr Ong said was “a very bright spot in a Covid-19-stricken econ­omy” – em­ploys about 171,000 work­ers and forms 13 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy.</p>
    <p>MAS es­ti­mates show that about 70 per cent of the work­force are Sin­ga­pore­ans, 14 per cent are per­ma­nent res­i­dents, and 16 per cent work pass hold­ers.</p>
    <p>For se­nior roles, Sin­ga­pore­ans form 44 per cent, per­ma­nent res­i­dents 20 per cent, and work pass hold­ers 36 per cent, said Mr Ong. These pro­por­tions have re­mained sta­ble in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edg­ing con­cerns over whether 44 per cent might be too low, he said the higher share of for­eign­ers in se­nior roles is mainly due to the large in­ter­na­tional com­po­nent of the ac­tiv­i­ties that are now in Sin­ga­pore’s fi­nan­cial cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“This is an en­vi­able po­si­tion. And if you ask Sin­ga­pore­ans if this is a good thing for our coun­try, I think</p>
