    <p>Co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of gam­ing chair maker Se­cret­lab</p>
    <p>He was named Sin­ga­pore’s En­tre­pre­neur of the Year by pro­fes­sional ser­vices firm EY ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>I was from: Or­chid Park Sec­ondary School (2005 to 2008).</p>
    <p>My best school mem­o­ries:</p>
    <p>“I was in soft­ball as a CCA and I also played soc­cer daily with many of my school­mates. Com­bine that with lots of gam­ing, and you can prob­a­bly see why I didn’t have time to be a good stu­dent.</p>
    <p>“I played a lot of games back then, in­clud­ing MMOs (mas­sively mul­ti­player on­line) such as RuneS­cape and team games like Dota, Counter-Strike.”</p>
    <p>One key les­son I’ve learnt: “I think it’s re­ally good to ex­plore things – other than study­ing – when you’re still young.</p>
    <p>“Our minds are the most open and ab­sorbent around the teenage years and I’ve re­alised that I learnt many con­cepts such as eco­nom­ics from gam­ing dur­ing that time.</p>
    <p>“I re­mem­ber I was re­ally into RuneS­cape. The game re­volves around the trad­ing of com­modi­ties (my first les­son: what com­modi­ties are).</p>
    <p>Then, un­der­stand­ing why each item is priced this way (in­trin­sic/util­ity value ver­sus mar­ket value), why prices spike and drop (mar­ket forces in­clud­ing sup­ply and de­mand), find­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties via ar­bi­trages and be­ing ex­posed to mar­ket ma­nip­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“Of course, I didn’t know most of these spe­cific terms back then, but I ab­sorbed and un­der­stood the con­cepts early on, mak­ing it easy for me to ex­plore them in de­tail later on in life.</p>
    <p>“I al­ways say this for gam­ing: Don’t be ad­dicted to gam­ing it­self. Be ad­dicted to the con­cept of im­prove­ment and achiev­ing your goals. Games are a great plat­form for this, be­cause they al­low one to fail, usu­ally without big con­se­quences.”</p>
    <p>If I were a stu­dent again: “I would have put in at least some ef­fort into my stud­ies by doing the min­i­mum: pay­ing at­ten­tion in class and get­ting my home­work done in a se­ri­ous man­ner. It doesn’t take much to do that.”</p>
