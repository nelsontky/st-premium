    <p>The sec­ond day of the crim­i­nal defama­tion trial of The On­line Cit­i­zen (TOC) ed­i­tor Terry Xu and TOC con­trib­u­tor Daniel De Costa saw the lat­ter’s lawyer M. Ravi at­tempt­ing to cast doubt on the cred­i­bil­ity of the pros­e­cu­tion’s wit­ness.</p>
    <p>In his cross-ex­am­i­na­tion yes­ter­day, Mr Ravi quizzed Mr Sim Wee Lee – the owner of the Ya­hoo email ac­count used to send the al­legedly defam­a­tory let­ter at the heart of the case – on var­i­ous de­tails about his che­quered past.</p>
    <p>De Costa and Xu were each charged with de­fam­ing mem­bers of the Sin­ga­pore Cabi­net in 2018 in the e-mail let­ter penned by De Costa and pub­lished by TOC, which claimed there was “cor­rup­tion in the high­est ech­e­lons” of the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party lead­er­ship. The let­ter was signed “Willy Sum”, a name some­times used by Mr Sim.</p>
    <p>De Costa was also charged with an of­fence un­der the Com­puter Mis­use Act for us­ing Mr Sim’s email ac­count to send the let­ter with­out per­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Si m tes­ti­fied through a Man­darin in­ter­preter that he be­came in­volved with an in­sur­ance fraud syn­di­cate in 2008.</p>
    <p>He said he cheated an in­sur­ance com­pany by mak­ing false ac­ci­dent claims, took part in il­le­gal soc­cer bet­ting on­line and bor­rowed money from loan sharks as he was fac­ing fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties. Around the same time, his Viet­namese wife left him and moved to the United States with her 12-year-old daugh­ter, whom Mr Sim had adopted.</p>
    <p>Mr Sim said he was grate­ful to De Costa for be­ing his lis­ten­ing ear dur­ing this dif­fi­cult time and help­ing him ar­range to see his MP, Mr Matthias Yao.</p>
    <p>He had sought the then MacPher­son MP’s help in ap­peal­ing to the Hous­ing Board for le­niency re­gard­ing the pay­ing of his ser­vice and con­ser­vancy charges, but his ap­peals were un­suc­cess­ful and the HDB re­pos­sessed his flat in 2012.</p>
    <p>Mr Ravi asked if Mr Sim had de­vel­oped un­hap­pi­ness with the Gov­ern­ment af­ter he failed to get help.</p>
    <p>He ref­er­enced a 2008 TOC ar­ti­cle, co-writ­ten by De Costa and one Glenn Tan, which had used Mr Sim’s prob­lems to crit­i­cise the per­ceived in­ac­tion of po­lit­i­cal of­fice­hold­ers and gov­ern­ment agen­cies.</p>
    <p>Mr Sim replied: “Of course, when you make an ap­pli­ca­tion to a gov­ern­ment agency and the ap­pli­ca­tion is re­jected, at that time you will def­i­nitely feel an­gry. But af­ter some time, the anger will lessen.”</p>
    <p>Said Mr Ravi: “I put it to you that you knew the ar­ti­cle was to be pub­lished. You were un­happy with the Gov­ern­ment and you told Daniel De Costa to pub­lish it as you wanted your prob­lems to go pub­lic.”</p>
    <p>Mr Sim dis­agreed, adding that he had con­fided in De Costa but was not in­formed that De Costa in­tended to pub­lish such an ar­ti­cle.</p>
    <p>“If Daniel had con­sulted me, I would not have agreed to let him use my full name and age,” said Mr Sim. How­ever, he con­ceded that he could not re­call whether some­one from TOC had con­tacted him be­fore the ar­ti­cle was pub­lished.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the trial, Mr Ravi com­plained to the court that Xu’s lawyers had ar­rived late.</p>
    <p>At one point, he also sug­gested he might refuse to con­tinue with the trial. He claimed there was an ap­pear­ance of bias on the part of District Judge Ng Peng Hong and called on the judge to disqual­ify him­self. The judge de­clined to do so, and Mr Ravi then pro­ceeded with the cross-ex­am­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>The trial con­tin­ues to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>De Costa and Xu were each charged with de­fam­ing mem­bers of the Sin­ga­pore Cabi­net in 2018 in the e-mail let­ter penned by De Costa and pub­lished by TOC, which claimed there was “cor­rup­tion in the high­est ech­e­lons” of the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party lead­er­ship.</p>
