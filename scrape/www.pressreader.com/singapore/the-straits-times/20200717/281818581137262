    <p>WASH­ING­TON • It was about 4pm on Wed­nes­day in the East Coast when chaos struck on­line.</p>
    <p>Dozens of the big­gest names in the United States – in­clud­ing pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den, for­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama, rap­per Kanye West, Mi­crosoft founder Bill Gates and en­tre­pre­neur Elon Musk – posted sim­i­lar mes­sages on Twit­ter: Send bit­coins and the fa­mous peo­ple would send back dou­ble your money.</p>
    <p>It was all a scam, of course, the re­sult of one of the most brazen on­line at­tacks in mem­ory.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter quickly re­moved many of the mes­sages, but in some cases sim­i­lar tweets were sent again from the same ac­counts, sug­gest­ing that Twit­ter was pow­er­less to re­gain con­trol.</p>
    <p>The firm even­tu­ally dis­abled broad swathes of its ser­vice, in­clud­ing the abil­ity of ver­i­fied users to tweet, for a cou­ple of hours as it scram­bled to pre­vent the scam from spread­ing fur­ther. Ser­vice was re­stored around 8.30pm on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter’s in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the breach re­vealed that sev­eral em­ploy­ees who had ac­cess to in­ter­nal sys­tems had their ac­counts com­pro­mised in a “co­or­di­nated so­cial en­gi­neer­ing at­tack”, a spokesman said, re­fer­ring to at­tacks that trick peo­ple into giv­ing up their cre­den­tials.</p>
    <p>The at­tack­ers then used Twit­ter’s in­ter­nal sys­tems to tweet from high-pro­file ac­counts.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter chief ex­ec­u­tive Jack Dorsey said in a post on Wed­nes­day night that it was a “tough day for us at Twit­ter”.</p>
    <p>“We all feel ter­ri­ble this hap­pened. We’re di­ag­nos­ing and will share ev­ery­thing we can when we have a more com­plete un­der­stand­ing of ex­actly what hap­pened.”</p>
    <p>The hack­ers did not use their ac­cess to take aim at any im­por­tant in­sti­tu­tions or in­fra­struc­ture – in­stead just ask­ing for bit­coins.</p>
    <p>But the at­tack was con­cern­ing to se­cu­rity ex­perts be­cause it sug­gested that the hack­ers could have eas­ily caused much more havoc.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials noted that the breach did not af­fect the ac­count of one of the most watched and pow­er­ful Twit­ter users: Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>His ac­count is un­der a spe­cial kind of lock and key af­ter past in­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>Se­cu­rity ex­perts said the widerang­ing at­tacks hinted that the prob­lem was caused by a se­cu­rity flaw in Twit­ter’s ser­vice, not by lax se­cu­rity mea­sures used by the peo­ple who were tar­geted.</p>
    <p>Mr Alex Sta­mos, di­rec­tor of the Stan­ford In­ter­net Ob­ser­va­tory and the for­mer chief se­cu­rity of­fi­cer of Face­book, said that there was a range of other the­o­ries, but all of them sug­gested that the at­tack­ers got in­side Twit­ter’s sys­tem rather than steal­ing the pass­words of in­di­vid­ual users.</p>
    <p>One Amer­i­can of­fi­cial called that a “scary pos­si­bil­ity” in a world where na­tional lead­ers, some­times imi­tat­ing Mr Trump’s tech­niques, have adopted Twit­ter as a pri­mary source of un­fil­tered com­mu­ni­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Sta­mos said: “It could have been much worse. We got lucky that this is what they de­cided to do with their power.”</p>
    <p>The hacker or hack­ers made some rookie er­rors.</p>
    <p>Mr Sta­mos said that be­cause the at­tack­ers had sent iden­ti­cal mes­sages from the com­pro­mised ac­counts, they were easy to de­tect and delete.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to ask for money through bit­coin, he added, showed that the at­tack­ers were most likely un­able or un­will­ing to laun­der money or use their ac­cess for a more so­phis­ti­cated scam.</p>
    <p>Scams in which hack­ers pose as pub­lic fig­ures on Twit­ter, and prom­ise to match or even triple any funds sent to their bit­coin wal­lets, are not new but this is the first time that real ac­counts of pub­lic fig­ures were used.</p>
    <p>By Wed­nes­day evening, the bit­coin wal­lets pro­moted in the tweets had re­ceived over 300 trans­ac­tions and held bit­coins worth over US$100,000 (S$139,000), ac­cord­ing to websites that track bit­coin’s pub­lic ledger of trans­ac­tions, which is known as the blockchain.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter ini­tially han­dled the at­tacks by tak­ing down the of­fend­ing tweets.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Bi­den cam­paign said that Twit­ter had re­moved the tweet pro­mot­ing the scam and locked down Mr Bi­den’s ac­count.</p>
    <p>But the hack­ers kept con­trol of many of the ac­counts, such as those of Mr Musk and Mr West, and sent out new mes­sages as soon as the old ones were taken down.</p>
    <p>Cy­ber-se­cu­rity ex­perts said that the at­tack showed how vul­ner­a­ble so­cial me­dia re­mains to at­tacks.</p>
    <p>“This demon­strates a real risk for the elec­tions,” Mr Sta­mos said.</p>
    <p>“Twit­ter has be­come the most im­por­tant plat­form when it comes to dis­cus­sion among po­lit­i­cal elites, and it has real vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties.”</p>
