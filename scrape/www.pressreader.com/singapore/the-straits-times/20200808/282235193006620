    <p>Fo­rum con­trib­u­tor Ee Teck Siew’s call for more mea­sures to pro­tect in­vestors is com­mend­able (Take steps to pro­tect in­vestors from be­ing burned, Aug 6).</p>
    <p>How­ever, a stock mar­ket with ex­ces­sive reg­u­la­tion can­not com­pete with the many vi­brant global mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Last year, the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX) man­aged 11 ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ings (IPOs), rais­ing about $3.8 bil­lion. Con­trast this with the Hong Kong Stock Ex­change, which raised US$40 bil­lion (S$55 bil­lion) with 144 IPOs. The Shang­hai and Shen­zhen ex­changes gar­nered 198 IPOs, rais­ing US$31.6 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Far­ther afield, the US mar­kets of the New York Stock Ex­change and</p>
    <p>Nas­daq raised US$50.9 bil­lion with 171 IPOs. Ev­i­dently, the race to be­come the gate­way to Asia has been lost.</p>
    <p>In the rush to pro­tect in­vestors, one can­not lose sight of the in­ter­ests of the pri­mary stake­hold­ers without which there is no mar­ket – the list­ing com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness own­ers want higher val­u­a­tions for their com­pa­nies, which ben­e­fits or­di­nary share in­vestors.</p>
    <p>But this hap­pens only with liq­uid­ity and high vol­umes driv­ing stock prices higher. Adding reg­u­la­tions only ag­gra­vates the per­sis­tent trend of delist­ing from SGX in favour of other mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Shrink­ing mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion also shrinks Sin­ga­pore stock weigh­tage in indices used as bench­marks by fund man­agers, lead­ing to re­duced in­vest­ment al­lo­ca­tion which hurts in­vestors on SGX.</p>
    <p>For manda­tory ed­u­ca­tion, SGX is quite pos­si­bly the only stock ex­change glob­ally that re­quires in­vestors to pass a Spec­i­fied In­vest­ment Prod­ucts quiz.</p>
    <p>Risk pro­fil­ing is a rudi­men­tary tool as most as­sess­ments are con­ducted without a com­pre­hen­sive pic­ture of an in­vestor’s to­tal wealth.</p>
    <p>The onus is on the in­vestor to un­der­stand that the stock mar­ket is a high-risk in­vest­ment arena.</p>
    <p>Every in­vestor should frame his in­vest­ment port­fo­lio and risk al­lo­ca­tion as a tri­an­gle, and ac­cept that stocks and even some bonds are right up at the apex, to be funded only with money that can be lost, lit­er­ally.</p>
    <p>There is no safe stock or bond. Even home-grown rep­utable blue chips have been bat­tered by the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>For those who dab­ble in penny stocks, no num­ber of reg­u­la­tions will pro­tect them. Penny stocks trade where they trade be­cause they typ­i­cally lack the ba­sic fun­da­men­tals of in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>There is no ques­tion that re­tire­ment funds must form the base of the risk tri­an­gle and be parked in low-risk in­vest­ments, and only the small apex por­tion should be put in the high-risk stock mar­ket.</p>
