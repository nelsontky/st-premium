    <p>• Thou­sands of peo­ple gath­ered i n the Thai cap­i­tal Bangkok yes­ter­day to show their de­vo­tion to the monar­chy on the birth­day of King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn’s late fa­ther, fol­low­ing months of street protests led by a youth move­ment de­mand­ing changes to royal pow­ers.</p>
    <p>King Va­ji­ra­longkorn led a can­dle-light­ing cer­e­mony in front of the Grand Palace to pay trib­ute to his fa­ther King Bhu­mi­bol Adulyadej, who died in 2016 af­ter reign­ing for seven decades – dur­ing which he was seen by many Thais as a sym­bol of na­tional unity.</p>
    <p>The king was joined by thou­sands of loy­al­ists wear­ing the royal colour yel­low and wav­ing na­tional flags.</p>
    <p>In re­cent months, the monar­chy in Thai­land has be­come a tar­get of a youth-led protest move­ment that ac­cuses the cur­rent king and the gov­ern­ment led by for­mer army chief Prayut Chan-o-cha of ex­pand­ing royal pow­ers to a level not seen since ab­so­lute monar­chy was ended in 1932.</p>
    <p>The pro­test­ers broke long­stand­ing taboos by openly crit­i­cis­ing King Va­ji­ra­longkorn for tak­ing di­rect con­trol of two mil­i­tary units and the wealth of the Crown Prop­erty Bureau, val­ued at tens of bil­lions of dol­lars.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s cer­e­mony was one of the big­gest shows of roy­al­ist sup­port since protests surged in July.</p>
    <p>“The king has al­ways been there to take care of peo­ple’s hap­pi­ness, and with­out the king there would be chaos,” Mr Wan­chote Kun­prasert, 65, told Reuters.</p>
    <p>An­other man who was hold­ing a por­trait of King Bhu­mi­bol said that re­spect for the monar­chy is deeply in­grained in Thai cul­ture and he dis­missed the protests call­ing for its re­form.</p>
    <p>“The monar­chy has been with us for cen­turies; how can you change that by just a few months of protests?” said Mr Siri­nan Jung­wat­munee, 63.</p>
