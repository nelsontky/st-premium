    <p>NEW YORK/BEI­JING • Even as the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion is threat­en­ing to ban pop­u­lar Chi­nese apps, in­clud­ing TikTok and WeChat, “the United States may lose in Trump’s TikTok war”, an ex­pert warns.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Wei Shangjin of Columbia Univer­sity’s Grad­u­ate School of Busi­ness and School of In­ter­na­tional and Public Af­fairs has said that forc­ing TikTok to be sold cheaply to a “very Amer­i­can” buyer will en­dan­ger US firms in the Chi­nese mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“If China were to mimic (US Pres­i­dent Don­ald) Trump’s gam­bit – al­leg­ing, with­out pro­vid­ing ev­i­dence, that some US multi­na­tion­als are po­ten­tial na­tional se­cu­rity threats – it could force them to sell their oper­a­tions to ‘very Chi­nese’ buy­ers,” Prof Wei said in an opin­ion piece pub­lished by Pro­ject Syn­di­cate last Thursday.</p>
    <p>Prof Wei, who was chief econ­o­mist of the Asian De­vel­op­ment Bank from 2014 to 2016, added: “Although the Chi­nese govern­ment has not yet done so, the risk has be­come higher now.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump last Thursday is­sued an ex­ec­u­tive or­der ban­ning US trans­ac­tions with Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy com­pany ByteDance, owner of TikTok, start­ing in 45 days.</p>
    <p>TikTok has been down­loaded more than 175 mil­lion times in the US and over a bil­lion times glob­ally, ac­cord­ing to the ex­ec­u­tive or­der, which claims that the app au­to­mat­i­cally cap­tures “vast swaths of in­for­ma­tion” from its users, pos­ing risks to US na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>A sim­i­lar ex­ec­u­tive or­der has been is­sued for WeChat, owned by Chi­nese tech gi­ant Ten­cent.</p>
    <p>Although Mr Trump’s ac­tions may yield a short-term gain for the US, they have in­tro­duced po­ten­tial risks to US in­ter­ests, not to men­tion rules of com­merce, Prof Wei said. Mr Trump is essen­tially do­ing what the US has long ac­cused China of do­ing: dis­re­spect­ing pri­vate prop­erty, pre­sum­ing guilt with­out ev­i­dence, erod­ing for­eign firms’ le­git­i­mate rights with­out com­pen­sa­tion and us­ing ar­bi­trary, opaque rules to block them from op­er­at­ing in the coun­try, he said.</p>
    <p>“There is still time for the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion to change course and avoid da­m­ag­ing US in­ter­ests. But the clock is run­ning.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a Global Times re­port yes­ter­day said Mr Trump’s at­tack on WeChat might cause US tech gi­ant Ap­ple to lose most of its Chi­nese users, who gen­er­ate up to 20 per cent of its global sales.</p>
    <p>It quoted a sur­vey launched last</p>
    <p>Friday by on­line busi­ness plat­form Xue­qiu that asked the public to choose be­tween Ap­ple and WeChat if WeChat were banned from Ap­ple’s App Store.</p>
    <p>About 800,900 of more than 850,000 re­spon­dents said they would switch to an Android phone if they could not use WeChat on Ap­ple’s iOS plat­form.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try ob­servers said if that hap­pened, most high-end Ap­ple users would likely switch to its Chi­nese ri­val Huawei, Global Times re­ported. WeChat is es­sen­tial for many Chi­nese users, as it is also a busi­ness and pay­ment tool.</p>
