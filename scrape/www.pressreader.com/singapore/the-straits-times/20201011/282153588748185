    <p>Iga Swiatek ad­mit­ted she was not good at vic­tory speeches, she did not know what to say, and awk­wardly men­tioned that she hoped her cat was watch­ing her on tele­vi­sion at home.</p>
    <p>But un­der­stand­ably so for a Pol­ish teenager who had just won her coun­try’s first Grand Slam sin­gles ti­tle yes­ter­day, as she de­feated Amer­i­can fourth seed Sofia Kenin 6-4, 6-1 to be­come the youngest women’s French Open cham­pion since 1992. The 19-year-old Swiatek, at 54 the low­est-ranked woman to cap­ture the Roland Gar­ros ti­tle in the mod­ern era, is the ninth first­time Ma­jor cham­pion in the past 14 Grand Slams.</p>
    <p>“It had to be like that that another un­der­dog won a Grand Slam in women’s ten­nis. It is so of­ten right now that it is crazy,” said Swiatek, who cap­tured her first tour ti­tle in the process.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know what’s go­ing on. It’s over­whelm­ing for me, it’s crazy. I’m so happy. I’m so happy my fam­ily is here fi­nally.</p>
    <p>“Two years ago I won a ju­nior Grand Slam (at Wim­ble­don) and now I’m here. It feels like such a short time.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter claim­ing vic­tory, she ex­cit­edly made her way into the stands to cel­e­brate with her fam­ily, in­clud­ing for­mer Olympic rower fa­ther To­masz, and her coach Piotr Sierzputow­ski.</p>
    <p>Swiatek, who had dropped only 28 games and not a sin­gle set the last two weeks, is the youngest women’s French Open win­ner since Mon­ica Se­les lifted the tro­phy as an 18-year-old in 1992.</p>
    <p>She is also the first teenage cham­pion since Iva Ma­joli in 1997.</p>
    <p>“It’s crazy for me be­cause I watched Rafael Nadal lift the tro­phy ev­ery year and now I’m in the same place,” she added.</p>
    <p>Swiatek also be­came just the sec­ond un­seeded women’s Roland Gar­ros cham­pion in the Open era, join­ing Je­lena Ostapenko who claimed a shock ti­tle three years ago.</p>
    <p>She eclipsed the run of com­pa­triot Jad­wiga Je­drze­jowska – the most out­stand­ing Pol­ish player of the in­ter­war pe­riod – who fin­ished run­ner-up at Roland Gar­ros in 1939.</p>
    <p>Swiatek was only the sec­ond Pol­ish woman to reach a Grand Slam fi­nal in the Open era af­ter Ag­nieszka Rad­wan­ska at Wim­ble­don in 2012. She had never pre­vi­ously been be­yond the last 16.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Open cham­pion Kenin, 21, was at­tempt­ing to be­come the first woman to cap­ture two Slams in the same year since An­gelique Ker­ber in 2016.</p>
    <p>“I just want to con­grat­u­late Iga on a great tour­na­ment and a great match. You played re­ally well,” she said.</p>
    <p>Swiatek, whose only pre­vi­ous tour-level fi­nal came at Lugano last year, dis­pelled any ini­tial fear of nerves as she won 12 of the first 15 points to surge 3-0 ahead.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Kenin has made a habit of fight­ing through tough sit­u­a­tions in Paris and broke back when Swiatek served a dou­ble fault to al­low the Amer­i­can to level at 3-all.</p>
    <p>But only briefly in the first set did Swiatek show any weak­ness, let­ting slip a 3-0 l ead, although Kenin’s chal­lenge ap­peared to be ham­pered by a thigh in­jury.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can needed treat­ment at 1-2 in the sec­ond set and, on the re­sump­tion, Swiatek was ut­terly ruth­less, con­ced­ing only three more points, She sealed the ti­tle with an un­stop­pable fore­hand, her 25th win­ner to Kenin’s 10.</p>
    <p>“I was just men­tally con­sis­tent. I just wanted to play ag­gres­sive as in pre­vi­ous rounds. It was re­ally stress­ful for me, so kind of hard,” said Swiatek, who will rise to 17th to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>WHAT IS HAP­PEN­ING?</p>
    <p>I don’t know what’s go­ing on. It’s over­whelm­ing for me, it’s crazy. I’m so happy. I’m so happy my fam­ily is here fi­nally.</p>
