    <p>BRUS­SELS • The Euro­pean Union launched le­gal pro­ceed­ings yes­ter­day in re­sponse to the Bri­tish govern­ment’s at­tempt to over­turn parts of the Brexit with­drawal agree­ment.</p>
    <p>The in­fringe­ment pro­ce­dure, which could come be­fore Euro­pean courts, has not yet de­railed post-Brexit trade talks, but re­flects the pes­simistic mood in Brus­sels as time runs short for a deal.</p>
    <p>“This morn­ing, the com­mis­sion has de­cided to send a let­ter of for­mal no­tice to the UK govern­ment. This is the first step in an in­fringe­ment pro­ce­dure,” EU chief Ur­sula von der Leyen said yes­ter­day. “The let­ter in­vites the UK govern­ment to send its ob­ser­va­tions within a month,” said Ms von der Leyen, the pres­i­dent of the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion, the EU ex­ec­u­tive.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Bri­tish law­mak­ers adopted a Bill to reg­u­late the United King­dom’s in­ter­nal mar­ket from Jan 1, when Bri­tain will com­plete its post-Brexit tran­si­tion pe­riod and leave the EU sin­gle mar­ket and Cus­toms union.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed law, by Lon­don’s own ad­mis­sion, over­writes parts of the with­drawal treaty that Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son signed with EU lead­ers last year, re­sult­ing in a breach of in­ter­na­tional law.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son’s govern­ment has de­scribed the Bill as a “safety net” in case post-Brexit trade talks fail and the EU tries to im­pose a Cus­toms bor­der be­tween Bri­tain and North­ern Ire­land.</p>
    <p>But EU cap­i­tals – in­clud­ing Dublin – see these pro­vi­sions as key to pre­vent­ing a re­turn of a hard bor­der with Ire­land and pre­serv­ing the good re­la­tions un­der­pinned by the Good Fri­day peace deal in North­ern Ire­land.</p>
    <p>“As you know, we had in­vited our Bri­tish friends to re­move the prob­lem­atic parts of their draft in­ter­nal mar­ket Bill by the end of Septem­ber,” Ms von der Leyen said. “This draft Bill is, by its very na­ture, a breach of the obli­ga­tion of good faith laid down in the with­drawal agree­ment. More­over, if adopted as is, it will be in full con­tra­dic­tion to the pro­to­col on Ire­land, North­ern Ire­land.</p>
    <p>“The dead­line lapsed yes­ter­day, the prob­lem­atic pro­vi­sions have not been re­moved.”</p>
    <p>An EU state­ment said that the Bill would breach Ar­ti­cle 5 of the with­drawal agree­ment, which states that both sides must “co­op­er­ate in good faith” to im­ple­ment the agree­ment.</p>
    <p>If Bri­tain does not back down, the in­fringe­ment pro­ce­dure could go all the way to the Euro­pean Court of Jus­tice, which would be able to im­pose large fines.</p>
    <p>“We will re­spond to the let­ter in due course,” a Bri­tish govern­ment spokesman told re­porters, play­ing down the sig­nif­i­cance of the an­nounce­ment. “We have clearly set out our rea­sons for in­tro­duc­ing the mea­sures re­lated to the North­ern Ire­land pro­to­col.</p>
    <p>“We need to cre­ate a le­gal safety net to pro­tect the in­tegrity of the UK’s in­ter­nal mar­ket, en­sure min­is­ters can al­ways de­liver on their obli­ga­tions to North­ern Ire­land and pro­tect the gains from the peace process.”</p>
    <p>If there is no deal by the end of this month, Euro­pean of­fi­cials warn it is hard to see how one could be rat­i­fied by the end of the year, mean­ing the UK would leave the sin­gle mar­ket with no trade agree­ment.</p>
