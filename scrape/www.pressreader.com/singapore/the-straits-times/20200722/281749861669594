    <p>SYD­NEY • Aus­tralia’s sec­ond most pop­u­lous state of Vic­to­ria yes­ter­day re­ported three deaths from the coro­n­avirus and logged 374 daily cases of in­fec­tions com­pared with 275 cases a day ear­lier.</p>
    <p>A woman in her 100s, an­other in her 90s and a third in her 80s have died from the virus, Premier Daniel An­drews said in a me­dia brief­ing in the state cap­i­tal Mel­bourne.</p>
    <p>The state so far has recorded just un­der 6,300 to­tal con­firmed cases of Covid-19, which is nearly half of the to­tal in­fec­tions in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria’s govern­ment has en­forced a six-week par­tial lock­down in Mel­bourne and asked residents to wear face masks when they step out­side their homes or risk fines to con­tain a flare-up in in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Neigh­bour­ing South Aus­tralia state will fur­ther tighten its border to guard against re­newed out­breaks of the coro­n­avirus by in­tro­duc­ing a max­i­mum two-year jail term for people who breach the rules.</p>
    <p>The state has closed its border to residents of Vic­to­ria. And trav­ellers from New South Wales and the Aus­tralian Cap­i­tal Ter­ri­tory have to self-quar­an­tine for 14 days and sub­mit for virus test­ing.</p>
    <p>The surge in in­fec­tions in the country has prompted Aus­tralia’s govern­ment to pump a fur­ther A$16.8 bil­lion (S$16.3 bil­lion) into its sig­na­ture wage sub­sidy pro­gramme to prop up an econ­omy that has been badly hit by a pro­longed re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme, which now sup­ports about 3.5 mil­lion work­ers, will be ex­tended by six months un­til the end of March, al­beit at a lower rate, Prime Min­is­ter Scott Morrison said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The extension of the pro­gramme al­lays fears of a hard end to the cur­rent A$70 bil­lion scheme which was sched­uled to end on Sept 30, es­pe­cially with un­em­ploy­ment al­ready at a 22-year high.</p>
    <p>But sub­si­dies will be re­duced un­der the new pro­gramme, which runs through to March 28 next year and is ex­pected to cover about one mil­lion work­ers, as Prime Min­is­ter Morrison’s Con­ser­va­tive govern­ment seeks to wean the econ­omy off fis­cal sup­port.</p>
    <p>“It has to scale down and work our­selves off these sup­ports be­cause they’re not en­dur­ing, they can­not be per­ma­nent, they were never de­signed to be per­ma­nent,” Mr Morrison told re­porters in Can­berra yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In the sup­port pro­gramme launched in March, work­ers from af­fected busi­nesses re­ceive A$1,500 once ev­ery fort­night.</p>
    <p>Un­der scaled-back sub­si­dies, they will re­ceive A$1,200 a fort­night, while those who work fewer than 20 hours a week will re­ceive A$700 ev­ery two weeks.</p>
    <p>From Jan 1, pay­ments will fall to A$1,000 and A$650 a fort­night, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits, which were in­creased in March by A$550 a fort­night un­til Sept 30, would be more than halved.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s cen­tral bank has wel­comed the con­tin­u­a­tion of both wage and un­em­ploy­ment sup­port, say­ing they play an im­por­tant role “in re­duc­ing the costly scar­ring to the econ­omy”.</p>
    <p>It said late last month that the econ­omy will need “con­sid­er­able” sup­port for some time, de­spite moves by states and ter­ri­to­ries to re­open their economies.</p>
