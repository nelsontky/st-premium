    <p>SYD­NEY • Aus­tralia yes­ter­day recorded its big­gest one-day rise in Covid-19 deaths, though the state at the epi­cen­tre of the coun­try’s out­break said the num­ber of new in­fec­tions held steady.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria state said 25 peo­ple had died from Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, more than the pre­vi­ous worst daily toll of 21 re­ported na­tion­ally on Aug 12.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties in the south-eastern state said 282 new Covid-19 cases had been de­tected, about the same as the 279 cases re­ported on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Those num­bers are well be­low the peak of more than 700 daily cases in Vic­to­ria ear­lier this month, and health of­fi­cials are con­fi­dent strict lock­down mea­sures are work­ing to con­tain the virus.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s sec­ond-largest city, Mel­bourne in Vic­to­ria, is in lock­down and still re­port­ing hun­dreds of new cases daily, although the num­ber is de­creas­ing.</p>
    <p>New South Wales (NSW) was the only other state yes­ter­day to re­port new Covid-19 cases, with seven de­tected in the past 24 hours.</p>
    <p>NSW Premier Gla­dys Bere­jik­lian apol­o­gised yes­ter­day for fail­ing to stop peo­ple car­ry­ing the coro­n­avirus from dis­em­bark­ing from a cruise ship in Syd­ney in March, trig­ger­ing what was at the time Aus­tralia’s worst out­break.</p>
    <p>Mis­steps in the han­dling of the Ruby Princess cruise ship have proven costly.</p>
    <p>“The lessons weren’t learnt soon enough and again I apol­o­gise un­re­servedly on be­half all of those in­di­vid­u­als and agen­cies who made those mis­takes,” Ms Bere­jik­lian told re­porters in Syd­ney.</p>
    <p>A pub­lic in­quiry into the Ruby Princess out­break con­cluded last week that NSW health of­fi­cials made “in­ex­cus­able” mis­takes when they al­lowed about 2,700 pas­sen­gers, 120 of whom were feel­ing un­well, to leave the Car­ni­val Cor­powned ship on March 19.</p>
    <p>The in­quiry found 914 in­fec­tions could be traced back to the Ruby Princess, mostly among pas­sen­gers. The out­break led to 28 deaths.</p>
    <p>Ms Bere­jik­lian apol­o­gised par­tic­u­larly to the 62 peo­ple who con­tracted the virus from a pas­sen­ger.</p>
    <p>“I can’t imag­ine what it would be like hav­ing a loved one or be­ing some­one your­self who con­tin­ues to suf­fer and ex­pe­ri­ence trauma as a re­sult,” she said.</p>
    <p>The in­quiry com­mis­sioned by Ms Bere­jik­lian’s govern­ment found that NSW health of­fi­cials failed to en­sure the ship knew of height­ened screen­ing for the virus, or en­sure that sick pas­sen­gers were iso­lated in their cab­ins. They also failed to get quick test re­sults for un­well pas­sen­gers be­fore they dis­em­barked.</p>
    <p>In a bid to stem the spread of the virus, the NSW au­thor­i­ties yes­ter­day said chil­dren will be banned from play­ing the recorder and singing in school choirs across Aus­tralia’s most pop­u­lous state.</p>
    <p>With in­fec­tions hit­ting sev­eral Syd­ney schools, the NSW au­thor­i­ties moved to pro­hibit choirs and wind en­sem­bles start­ing to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>“School for­mals, dances, grad­u­a­tion or other so­cial events are not per­mit­ted,” the NSW ed­u­ca­tion depart­ment added.</p>
    <p>Although pub­lic schools in Syd­ney and the rest of NSW have re­opened af­ter ini­tial lock­downs, the au­thor­i­ties said the new mea­sures would help them op­er­ate in the “safest ways pos­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has recorded 23,500 Covid-19 cases and 421 deaths, far fewer than many other de­vel­oped na­tions.</p>
