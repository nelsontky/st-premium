    <p>A mis­la­belling of swab sam­ples in Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal’s lab­o­ra­tory led to a Sec­ondary 1 stu­dent in Jurong West Sec­ondary School be­ing wrongly re­ported to have Covid-19 last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The hos­pi­tal has apol­o­gised, and in­sti­tuted ad­di­tional checks to pre­vent a re­peat of such an in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>The fe­male stu­dent was ear­lier re­ported to be linked to a school­mate who was pre­vi­ously con­firmed to be in­fected.</p>
    <p>The er­ror was dis­cov­ered af­ter sub­se­quent tests of the stu­dent came back neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>The mis­la­belled pos­i­tive sam­ple be­longed to a mi­grant worker, who had been iso­lated since his swab, and who has not been in con­tact with any other in­di­vid­ual.</p>
    <p>A Sec­ondary 1 stu­dent from Jurong West Sec­ondary School, who was told that she had Covid-19, has now been in­formed that it was a mis­take.</p>
    <p>Hu­man er­ror in Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal’s (TTSH) lab­o­ra­tory – which the hos­pi­tal has apol­o­gised for – led to the false di­ag­no­sis.</p>
    <p>The 13-year-old stu­dent was re­ported last Fri­day to have tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>She was swabbed be­cause she had been in con­tact with a school­mate, a 13-year-old boy, who was pre­vi­ously con­firmed to be in­fected.</p>
    <p>With the lat­est find­ings, there is no sec­ond con­firmed case in the school or stu­dent-to-stu­dent trans­mis­sion, said Ms Liew Wei Li, the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion’s (MOE) di­rec­tor of schools.</p>
    <p>All 71 stu­dents and staff who were the close con­tacts of the first case in Jurong West Sec­ondary School have tested neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate state­ment, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said that “due to a hu­man er­ror”, the lab­o­ra­tory had mis­la­belled a swab sam­ple from a Covid-19-pos­i­tive in­di­vid­ual as be­long­ing to the stu­dent, with­out prop­erly ver­i­fy­ing the pa­tient iden­ti­fiers of the spec­i­men tubes.</p>
    <p>The er­ror was dis­cov­ered upon retest­ing of the stu­dent and the MOH was in­formed of the er­ror on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the first test, the stu­dent was ad­mit­ted to the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal (NUH) where she was retested twice. Both test re­sults came back neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>The TTSH lab­o­ra­tory then re­peated a poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test on the orig­i­nal sam­ple and the re­sult was also neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions showed that the mis­la­belled pos­i­tive sam­ple be­longed to a mi­grant worker who had been iso­lated since his swab, and had not been in con­tact with any other in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>He is cur­rently well, and has been ad­mit­ted to the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases.</p>
    <p>The stu­dent, who had been iso­lated while at NUH, had not come into con­tact with other Covid-19 pa­tients there and is, there­fore, not at risk of in­fec­tion from other pa­tients in the hos­pi­tal, the min­istry added.</p>
    <p>But since she was a close con­tact of her school­mate who was in­fected ear­lier, she will con­tinue to be in quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>The MOH has, how­ever, re­scinded the quar­an­tine or­ders of her close con­tacts who had pre­vi­ously been placed on quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Stress­ing that it takes a se­ri­ous view of the lapse, the MOH said:</p>
    <p>“We are in­ves­ti­gat­ing this mat­ter, and will take ap­pro­pri­ate ac­tions against the lab­o­ra­tory if it is found to be in breach of pro­to­cols.”</p>
    <p>TTSH said of the er­ror: “We are sorry for the mis­take and sin­cerely re­gret the in­con­ve­nience caused to our pa­tients and her school.”</p>
    <p>“We au­dited our lab­o­ra­tory test­ing for Covid-19 for that pe­riod and no other mis­la­belling was dis­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>“We have also put in place ad­di­tional checks to pre­vent such an in­ci­dent from oc­cur­ring again,” it added.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Sec 1 stu­dents at Jurong West Sec­ondary School will con­tinue home-based learn­ing un­til Fri­day, as a num­ber of teach­ers from the school are still serv­ing home quar­an­tine or­ders, said Ms Liew.</p>
    <p>Classes for all other lev­els will con­tinue in school as per nor­mal.</p>
    <p>Ms Liew said that all schools have im­ple­mented com­pre­hen­sive safe man­age­ment mea­sures to en­sure the safety of stu­dents and staff, and min­imise the risk of trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes spaced-out seat­ing in class­rooms to en­sure safe dis­tanc­ing, the wear­ing of face masks, stag­gered ar­rival, dis­missal and re­cess tim­ings, and min­imis­ing in­ter­min­gling across classes and lev­els.</p>
    <p>“Stu­dents should also head di­rectly home af­ter school,” said Ms Liew.</p>
    <p>“It is also equally im­por­tant that each of us ex­er­cises per­sonal re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>“We would like to re­mind all par­ents, staff and stu­dents that if a stu­dent or any adult fam­ily mem­ber is un­well, the stu­dent should not go to school.”</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said on Face­book yes­ter­day: “On July 10, all of us at MOE were dis­mayed when we learnt that at Jurong West Sec­ondary School, a stu­dent who caught the Covid-19 virus at home has in­fected an­other class­mate.</p>
    <p>“This would have been our first recorded Covid-19 in­fec­tion in school, de­spite all our pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>He added: “To our re­lief, TTSH and MOH have clar­i­fied that it was a case of er­ro­neous re­port­ing by the test­ing lab­o­ra­tory.”</p>
