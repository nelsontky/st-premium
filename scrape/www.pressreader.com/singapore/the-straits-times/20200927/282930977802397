    <p>Nine months af­ter the coro­n­avirus sur­faced, Covid-19 has claimed close to one mil­lion lives around the world, in­fected over 32 mil­lion peo­ple, and sent many more into poverty.</p>
    <p>Work on vac­cines is well un­der way, with over 40 be­ing tested, of which nine are in fi­nal-stage tri­als.</p>
    <p>But in­oc­u­la­tion will take time and changes to our way of life are set to re­main for a while yet, from pro­tec­tive mea­sures to so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Take masks.</p>
    <p>We will all likely have to wear them for months to come, if not years.</p>
    <p>The use of SafeEn­try to visit mar­kets, malls and other build­ings is also set to re­main.</p>
    <p>Th­ese nec­es­sary ad­just­ments re­quired to stay safe, and keep oth­ers around us safe, have been largely ac­cepted in Sin­ga­pore and many other so­ci­eties.</p>
    <p>Other changes have af­fected peo­ple and busi­nesses ad­versely, some more so than oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Work­places, for one thing, have wit­nessed con­sid­er­able change, here and around the world.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, many of­fices have re­mained largely quiet since the cir­cuit breaker in April, and even as re­stric­tions have been eased since June.</p>
    <p>In the lat­est round of eas­ing, up to half of all em­ploy­ees can at any one time re­turn to the of­fice from to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>How­ever, work­ing from home re­mains the de­fault, and those pieces of red tape on ev­ery other chair as well as on con­fer­ence and can­teen ta­bles are set to re­main to en­sure safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Work­ers must also op­er­ate in split teams, with no in­ter­min­gling or so­cial­is­ing.</p>
    <p>The travel sec­tor has been hit es­pe­cially hard, too. More green lane ar­range­ments with a num­ber of coun­tries are in the pipe­line, but don’t count on a re­sump­tion of leisure travel next year.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board chief ex­ec­u­tive Keith Tan said last Thurs­day that the tourism in­dus­try had to be pre­pared for a long win­ter, as it could take three to five years for in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tor ar­rivals to re­turn to pre-Covid-19 lev­els, even if a vac­cine is avail­able soon.</p>
    <p>And as avi­a­tion, tourism and re­lated sec­tors en­ter a pro­longed hiatus, the toll on jobs – es­pe­cially as sup­port mea­sures ta­per off – is ex­pected to rise, with re­trench­ments in­evitable.</p>
    <p>So it is no sur­prise that a re­cent study, re­sults of which were re­leased last Thurs­day, found that three in four Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents were anx­ious about the im­pact of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey by mar­ket­ing com­mu­ni­ca­tions agency Wun­der­man Thompson, con­ducted in late June and early July, found the econ­omy was the main cause of anx­i­ety.</p>
    <p>For those be­tween the ages of 18 and 24, their main con­cerns were find­ing jobs that fit their skills, with grad­u­ates fac­ing dif­fi­culty in their job search.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar con­cerns have sur­faced else­where, with ex­perts warn­ing of a men­tal health tsunami.</p>
    <p>At a con­fer­ence last week, Pro­fes­sor Vikram Pa­tel of Har­vard Med­i­cal School noted that wor­ries about jobs and in­come se­cu­rity, so­cial ex­clu­sion, school clo­sures and work­ing from home, among other is­sues, have cre­ated huge pres­sures on fam­i­lies, and could fuel a wors­en­ing of men­tal health glob­ally.</p>
    <p>SIL­VER LIN­ING</p>
    <p>While the cur­rent cri­sis may have made many work­ers anx­ious, and placed vul­ner­a­ble in­di­vid­u­als and groups un­der greater stress, it has also been a cat­a­lyst for change – hope­fully for the bet­ter.</p>
    <p>One area is the uptick in sup­port for such vul­ner­a­ble per­sons.</p>
    <p>There have been a good num­ber of ground-up ef­forts that peo­ple have ini­ti­ated to help needy res­i­dents and mi­grant work­ers, some of which my col­leagues have re­ported on.</p>
    <p>Many of them are on­go­ing, and there can be no short­age of ini­tia­tives to look out for those in need of help, whether it is ex­tra cash sup­port or a lis­ten­ing ear from a neigh­bour.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 cri­sis has also flagged the im­por­tance of is­sues like men­tal health and well­ness, which de­serve greater at­ten­tion among em­ploy­ers as well as work­ers.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Coun­cil of So­cial Ser­vice re­cently an­nounced it is step­ping up its na­tional cam­paign to sup­port per­sons with men­tal health con­di­tions and raise pub­lic aware­ness of how to help them re­cover and be more re­silient.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts ex­pect men­tal health needs to in­crease as liveli­hoods are hit and peo­ple re­main anx­ious.</p>
    <p>As Prof Pa­tel said: “The pan­demic presents a his­toric op­por­tu­nity to reimag­ine men­tal health­care, by re­al­is­ing the sci­ence which demon­strates that we must re­frame men­tal health be­yond a nar­row fo­cus on ‘di­ag­noses, doc­tors and drugs’.”</p>
    <p>This in­cludes em­pha­sis­ing pre­ven­tive ac­tions es­pe­cially among the young, plac­ing the lived ex­pe­ri­ence at the heart of men­tal health­care and show­ing that peo­ple in the com­mu­nity may be best placed to of­fer help.</p>
    <p>Much has been done in re­cent years to ad­dress the stigma of­ten as­so­ci­ated with men­tal health con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>But there is room to do more, in­clud­ing mak­ing men­tal health­care more widely ac­ces­si­ble and af­ford­able.</p>
    <p>THE FU­TURE OF WORK?</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has also high­lighted how care­givers – whether par­ents with young chil­dren or those look­ing af­ter the el­derly – have not found it easy jug­gling their du­ties with work.</p>
    <p>Work­ing from home has thrown up chal­lenges for many, es­pe­cially when schools and child­care cen­tres were closed ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>But what has been de­scribed as the en­forced re­mote work­ing ex­per­i­ment has now be­come widely ac­cepted for many white-col­lar ex­ec­u­tives and sup­port staff.</p>
    <p>Many early adopters of flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments – whether al­low­ing staff to op­er­ate from home on cer­tain days of the week, or to work out­side reg­u­lar hours – had found them help­ful in re­cruit­ing as well as re­tain­ing em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>They have also been quicker to ad­just to this new nor­mal.</p>
    <p>As the pan­demic is likely to be with us for some time, em­ploy­ers and work­ers will have to adapt to a hy­brid work ar­range­ment – with all em­ploy­ees hav­ing to work at home some of the time, and in the of­fice for meet­ings, or part of the time.</p>
    <p>This shift should not just be a case of ad­just­ing pro­ce­dures.</p>
    <p>Re­cent years have seen a sig­nif­i­cant move in some in­dus­tries away from per­ma­nent em­ploy­ees to con­tract staff who are tasked to work on spe­cific projects.</p>
    <p>The on­go­ing dis­rup­tions to some sec­tors as a re­sult of the pan­demic could be an op­por­tu­nity for some busi­nesses to re­view their op­er­a­tions, be­yond just mov­ing to new ar­eas or cater­ing to new de­mand – for in­stance, from for­eign visi­tors to do­mes­tic tourists.</p>
    <p>Could this be an op­por­tu­nity to reimag­ine the fu­ture of work on a larger scale?</p>
    <p>Ini­tia­tives like job shar­ing have come about to cater to de­mands for flexi-work ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>Why not a three- or four-day work week, which would help those with care­giv­ing or other com­mit­ments who might oth­er­wise drop out of the labour mar­ket?</p>
    <p>As Sin­ga­pore seeks to re­view its de­pen­dence on for­eign work­ers, th­ese op­tions could also be use­ful to meet man­power needs.</p>
    <p>BUILD­ING BACK BET­TER</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has also un­der­lined the need for what some have called a re­boot, or re­view, of a range of is­sues within and across so­ci­eties in or­der to build back bet­ter.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has con­vened the Emerg­ing Stronger Task­force to con­sult widely and make rec­om­men­da­tions for the Repub­lic to re­bound and thrive in a post-Covid-19 econ­omy.</p>
    <p>A se­ries of Emerg­ing Stronger Con­ver­sa­tions is also be­ing held un­der the Sin­ga­pore To­gether move­ment to gather views and sug­ges­tions from Sin­ga­pore­ans on their ex­pe­ri­ences dur­ing the pan­demic, as well as pos­si­ble ac­tions and so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a wide-rang­ing re­view of mat­ters af­fect­ing women and equal­ity is un­der way.</p>
    <p>It will look, among other things, at is­sues such as fam­ily vi­o­lence, which has risen dur­ing the pan­demic, and how to bet­ter sup­port women who have shoul­dered an un­even bur­den in care­giv­ing work.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar ques­tions about how to build back bet­ter have been raised on a global level.</p>
    <p>Last week, United Na­tions sec­re­tary-gen­eral An­to­nio</p>
    <p>Guter­res put it bluntly when he said the pan­demic was a clear test of in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion, “a test we have es­sen­tially failed”.</p>
    <p>“It has killed nearly one mil­lion peo­ple around the world, in­fected over 30 mil­lion, and re­mains largely out of con­trol. This was the re­sult of a lack of global pre­pared­ness, co­op­er­a­tion, unity and sol­i­dar­ity,” he added.</p>
    <p>“Ei­ther we come to­gether in global in­sti­tu­tions that are fit for pur­pose, or we will be crushed by di­vi­sive­ness and chaos.”</p>
    <p>Crises like the present have seen pres­sures like pro­tec­tion­ism rear their ugly head.</p>
    <p>But prob­lems like the pan­demic don’t recog­nise bor­ders, and have up­ended the global econ­omy with dev­as­tat­ing im­pact across all coun­tries.</p>
    <p>There are signs of hope where global co­op­er­a­tion is con­cerned on some fronts, such as the mul­ti­lat­eral bid to en­sure eq­ui­table ac­cess to a Covid-19 vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Over 150 economies – in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore – have com­mit­ted to en­sure vac­cines reach those who need them most, who­ever they are and wher­ever they live, through an ini­tia­tive called the Co­vax Fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>Such co­or­di­na­tion on a vac­cine is a wel­come early step, and agen­cies like the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion and World Bank play a key role in man­ag­ing the pan­demic and its im­pact on so­ci­eties.</p>
    <p>But many more steps are re­quired – within and across so­ci­eties – if in­di­vid­u­als, busi­nesses and coun­tries are to weather the un­cer­tain­ties ahead.</p>
