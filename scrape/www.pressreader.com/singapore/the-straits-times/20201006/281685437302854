    <p>If there were fears that “zom­bie” firms would be kept alive by a drip-feed of state aid, or that cer­tain seg­ments of Sin­ga­pore­ans would be left be­hind in the fu­ture econ­omy, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat put them to rest in his min­is­te­rial state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>There was al­ways the risk that blan­ket Covid-19 sup­port by gov­ern­ments around the world would merely prop up the cor­po­rate un­dead – es­pe­cially in sec­tors where con­sumer habits have shifted for good.</p>
    <p>But Mr Heng, who is also the Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies and Min­is­ter for Fi­nance, made it clear that the au­thor­i­ties here will turn their fo­cus to mea­sures that pre­pare work­ers and vi­able firms for the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>For em­ploy­ees, this means reskilling and up­skilling, which will make it eas­ier for them to move be­tween firms and industries.</p>
    <p>The lat­est move is to ex­tend the En­hanced Train­ing Sup­port Pack­age un­til June next year, to pro­vide course fee sub­si­dies for firms in the hard­est-hit sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties – a group of­ten sin­gled out by MPs as need­ing more vis­i­bil­ity and help – will re­ceive the higher tier of 50 per cent wage sup­port un­der the Jobs Growth In­cen­tive, which en­cour­ages firms to hire lo­cals.</p>
    <p>For firms seek­ing to go global and go dig­i­tal, a slew of ca­pa­bil­ity-build­ing grants will be fur­ther boosted.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng broke down what he called a “re­freshed” na­tional eco­nomic strat­egy into three pri­or­ity ar­eas: re­mak­ing Sin­ga­pore as a Global-Asia node of tech­nol­ogy, in­no­va­tion and en­ter­prise; fos­ter­ing in­clu­sive growth, in­clud­ing for the lower-in­come, the dif­fer­ently abled and senior work­ers; and in­vest­ing in eco­nomic re­silience and sus­tain­abil­ity as a source of com­pet­i­tive advantage.</p>
    <p>He stressed that the Gov­ern­ment has been “de­lib­er­ate” in chan­nelling ad­di­tional aid to vul­ner­a­ble groups when de­sign­ing sup­port schemes; and that eco­nomic re­silience is not a new con­cept for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“We have achieved re­silience through a diver­si­fied eco­nomic struc­ture, with mul­ti­ple en­gines of growth.</p>
    <p>“No one in­dus­try ac­counts for much more than 20 per cent of our GDP (gross do­mes­tic prod­uct), so we do not put all our eggs in one bas­ket.”</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s min­is­te­rial state­ment em­pha­sised build­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties for the fu­ture and rightly so, be­cause firms and work­ers must pivot in or­der to thrive in a new world.</p>
    <p>But the world to­day is still a long way from nor­mal.</p>
    <p>Re­cov­ery re­mains patchy. While global fac­tory out­put has made up al­most all of the ground it lost dur­ing lock­downs, ser­vices ac­tiv­ity is still be­low its pre-pan­demic level, as con­sumers re­main skit­tish about be­ing in­fected in large crowds.</p>
    <p>The avi­a­tion sec­tor con­tin­ues to limp along, with the num­ber of sched­uled flights barely half what it was be­fore Covid-19 struck.</p>
    <p>Not ev­ery­one will be able to re­turn to their old jobs, as­sum­ing these still ex­ist. Real­lo­cat­ing re­dun­dant re­sources to pro­duc­tive firms will take time.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng ac­knowl­edged the dif­fi­cul­ties ahead, es­pe­cially those faced by vul­ner­a­ble and ma­ture work­ers. He spoke of a tar­geted ap­proach, for in­stance, by match­ing them with op­por­tu­ni­ties in the heart­land where firms may find it tough to hire work­ers.</p>
    <p>Touch points closer to home, such as so­cial ser­vices of­fices and neigh­bour­hood SGUnited Jobs and Skills cen­tres, can help re­duce job search fric­tion.</p>
    <p>But one imag­ines that the is­sue of whether the mea­sures are merely in­cre­men­tal will rear its head once more, when Par­lia­ment de­bates the state­ment on Oct 14.</p>
    <p>Should there be some form of lim­ited uni­ver­sal ba­sic in­come or un­em­ploy­ment in­sur­ance? Will the topic of a min­i­mum wage come up again?</p>
    <p>Eco­nomic re­search on these is­sues can be dif­fi­cult to parse, and ar­gu­ments of­ten turn on spe­cific in­dus­try and na­tional cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>Those ar­gu­ing for such changes must weigh them against other poli­cies that also help the work­ing poor, such as sub­si­dies and cash grants to low-in­come house­holds.</p>
    <p>Then there is the chal­lenge of re­plen­ish­ing the state cof­fers.</p>
    <p>Op­er­at­ing on the guid­ing prin­ci­ple of “pru­dence, not aus­ter­ity”, gov­ern­ment ex­pen­di­ture has risen in the form of sub­stan­tial trans­fers to house­holds and busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment’s op­er­at­ing rev­enue is ex­pected to be 16 per cent lower than ini­tial es­ti­mates in Fe­bru­ary. Goods and ser­vices tax (GST) col­lec­tions could fall by 14 per cent.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pect our rev­enue po­si­tion to be weak for a num­ber of years, as the ef­fects of Covid-19 on the global econ­omy linger, and our econ­omy slows,” said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>The de­cline in GST rev­enue is not un­ex­pected, given the steep fall in vis­i­tor ar­rivals and lower level of spend­ing and con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>Some have said that the im­pend­ing GST hike – a rise of two per­cent­age points some time be­tween 2022 and 2025 – could come sooner rather than later to bol­ster tax rev­enues.</p>
    <p>One thing is cer­tain: Whether a vac­cine can be found and rolled out quickly or not, there will be scars.</p>
    <p>Jobs will be lost. Firms’ re­luc­tance to in­vest to­day will mean less pro­duc­tive ca­pac­ity in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Higher taxes also tend to de­press con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren from vul­ner­a­ble fam­i­lies could suf­fer more food, hous­ing and psy­cho­log­i­cal in­se­cu­rity as Covid-19 drags on.</p>
    <p>Just as the dis­ease it­self has per­sis­tent ef­fects even af­ter pa­tients re­cover, the pan­demic will leave the coun­try feel­ing un­der the weather for some time to come.</p>
