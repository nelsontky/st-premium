    <p>SHANGHAI • Re­tiree Chen Ji­fang hits the gym for at least two hours every day and has a physique to prove it. At nearly 70, she is be­ing held up as a shin­ing ex­am­ple as China or­ders its vast pop­u­la­tion to get fit and lose the bulge.</p>
    <p>The grand­mother from Shanghai has be­come a mi­nor celebrity in re­cent months as her new­found and un­likely love for work­ing out made na­tional head­lines.</p>
    <p>Af­ter be­com­ing a gym bunny in De­cem­ber 2018, Madam Chen lost 14kg in three months and now sports a flat ab­domen and toned mus­cles that peo­ple decades younger as­pire to.</p>
    <p>She has built up a fan base on so­cial me­dia, clock­ing up 410,000 fol­low­ers on TikTok with her im­pres­sive ex­er­cise rou­tines and en­cour­ag­ing oth­ers to fol­low her ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>A post on the video-shar­ing app of the pen­sioner do­ing a rapid set of lung-bust­ing squats and lunges has been viewed more than one mil­lion times.</p>
    <p>“I will work out as long as I’m still alive,” Madam Chen, who turned 68 this year, tells Agence FrancePres­se at a gym in a Shanghai sub­urb.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese state me­dia have re­ported her story with gusto be­cause it fits the gov­ern­ment’s drive to en­cour­age peo­ple of all ages to get fit­ter.</p>
    <p>That mes­sage has been am­pli­fied this year by an as­ser­tion that be­ing fit is one way to help beat the coro­n­avirus, which emerged in Wuhan late last year.</p>
    <p>Xin­min Evening News de­scribed Madam Chen as “hard­core grandma” and Xin­hua news agency called her a “heavy-lift­ing granny”.</p>
    <p>She has also been fea­tured on tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>For Madam Chen, who worked for a food com­pany be­fore re­tir­ing, pump­ing iron has come late in life.</p>
    <p>She be­gan go­ing to the gym fol­low­ing a chance meet­ing with a per­sonal trainer, pro­pelled into ac­tion by wor­ries about her de­te­ri­o­rat­ing health and weight gain.</p>
    <p>But she has shed the flab and got a clean bill of health last year from doc­tors, hav­ing pre­vi­ously had prob­lems with a fatty liver, high blood pres­sure and eye cataracts.</p>
    <p>Madam Chen, who has a grand­son aged 14, re­called the shocked looks she got the first time she walked through the gym door.</p>
    <p>“They found it very strange, they don’t usu­ally see peo­ple at such an old age who care about their health so much,” she said.</p>
    <p>De­spite her ac­tive lifestyle, Madam Chen has no sport­ing back­ground and said she barely got out of bed when her daugh­ter was very young be­cause her body was so weak from giv­ing birth.</p>
    <p>“If your mus­cles are strong and pow­er­ful, they will pro­tect your bones if you fall, be­cause the el­derly are most afraid of fall­ing,” she said. “In fact, I also fell once and fell ter­ri­bly, hurt­ing my fore­head, hips, knees and toes.”</p>
    <p>She re­called: “They saw an old lady with white hair ly­ing on the ground and passers-by started call­ing an am­bu­lance. I said ‘don’t’ and I got up. I said that I had been ex­er­cis­ing, so I’m fine.”</p>
    <p>She added: “At our age, it is not how much money you have, who you are, or how good your chil­dren are. You just want a med­i­cal record that is as short as pos­si­ble.”</p>
