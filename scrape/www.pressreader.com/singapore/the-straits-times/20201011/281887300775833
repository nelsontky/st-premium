    <p>WHO ARE THE MILI­TIAS?</p>
    <p>A sub­cul­ture of armed right-wing groups with var­ied mo­ti­va­tions has long ex­isted in the US.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump came to power, many have come out of the shad­ows, most in­fa­mously join­ing the no­to­ri­ous 2017 Unite the Right rally in Char­lottesvill­e, Vir­ginia, and this year protest­ing against Covid-19 re­stric­tions while heav­ily armed, and con­fronting anti-po­lice and Black Lives Mat­ter pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>The most prom­i­nent – the Three Per­centers, Oath Keep­ers, Proud Boys, Booga­loo Bois, and Pa­triot Prayer – co­a­lesce around anti-au­thor­ity, anti-left­ist and pro-gun rights ide­olo­gies. Some are white su­prem­a­cists with ties to neo-Nazi move­ments; some see the po­lice as au­thor­i­tar­ian en­e­mies; oth­ers say they are pre­par­ing for a na­tional revo­lu­tion or race war.</p>
    <p>Some also sub­scribe to the QAnon move­ment em­brac­ing un­founded the­o­ries of a “deep state” threat to Mr Trump and a global child-kid­nap­ping con­spir­acy led by Democrats.</p>
    <p>No one knows how many fol­low­ers the groups have, but it is eas­ily in the thou­sands, in all ar­eas of the coun­try con­nected by so­cial me­dia and en­crypted mes­sag­ing.</p>
    <p>WHO WERE THE PEO­PLE IN THE MICHI­GAN PLOT?</p>
    <p>Many of the 13 ar­rested ex­pressed sup­port for the Booga­loo ide­ol­ogy, and sev­eral were mem­bers of the re­cently formed lo­cal Wolver­ine Watch­men armed mili­tia.</p>
    <p>Booga­loo is a lead­er­less, looselysha­ped ide­ol­ogy formed around gun cul­ture and the be­lief of a loom­ing war or in­sur­rec­tion, fought with the left, with a dic­ta­to­rial govern­ment, or over race.</p>
    <p>Some of those ar­rested had joined ral­lies this year against Michi­gan Gover­nor Gretchen Whit­mer’s coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions, wear­ing para­mil­i­tary gear, car­ry­ing mul­ti­ple weapons, and declar­ing their rights were be­ing vi­o­lated.</p>
    <p>The Wolver­ine Watch­men reg­u­larly un­der­took firearms train­ing “to pre­pare for the ‘booga­loo’, a term ref­er­enc­ing a vi­o­lent up­ris­ing against the govern­ment or im­pend­ing po­lit­i­cally-mo­ti­vated civil war”, said a Michi­gan state court fil­ing.</p>
    <p>DO THE MILI­TIAS THREATEN THE ELEC­TION?</p>
    <p>Po­ten­tially, yes. Mr Trump has re­peat­edly called on his fol­low­ers to go to polling sites to “pro­tect” the vote. “I’m urg­ing my sup­port­ers to go into the polls and watch very care­fully, be­cause that’s what has to hap­pen,” he said dur­ing his elec­tion de­bate against Mr Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the de­bate he also told the vi­o­lent armed Proud Boys group to “stand by”. One of the group’s or­gan­is­ers, Joe Biggs, an­swered on so­cial me­dia: “Well sir, we’re ready.”</p>
    <p>In states that al­low the open carry of firearms, there are few rules to pre­vent mili­tia groups or armed ac­tivists from descend­ing on a vot­ing sta­tion to watch or protest, as long as they do not di­rectly me­nace vot­ers.</p>
