    <p>The ini­tial in­vest­ment into live-stream­ing equip­ment was steep, but it is pay­ing off. More im­por­tantly, the big pic­ture is about pro­vid­ing a qual­ity venue for mu­si­cians to con­tinue to per­form and keep the mar­ket go­ing. We feel grate­ful that we’re able to play a small role in keep­ing things go­ing for the arts and mu­sic scene.</p>
    <p>Reza Global Pro­duc­tions’ re­hearsal spa­ces used to throb with the sound of mu­sic, but the com­pany was forced to close its 15-year-old jam­ming stu­dios for good in May.</p>
    <p>Founder and owner Mo­hamed Roslan es­ti­mates that his busi­ness, which in­cludes equip­ment ren­tal, had dropped by 90 per cent com­pared with the pre-pan­demic days.</p>
    <p>“I’ve lost about $40,000 in busi­ness since the start of the year. We couldn’t carry on so we de­cided to sell off some of the equip­ment and close the stu­dios,” says the 48-yearold, who first opened his stu­dios un­der a dif­fer­ent name, O’lando, in 2005. He now re­lies on the ren­tal busi­ness for in­come.</p>
    <p>Like many other busi­nesses in Sin­ga­pore, jam­ming stu­dios – an es­sen­tial part of the mu­sic scene here – have been hard hit by the Covid-19 pan­demic. It is es­ti­mated that there are over 40 jam­ming stu­dios dot­ted around Sin­ga­pore, with rates that range from $10 to more than $70 an hour. Many of them are small-scale es­tab­lish­ments, of­fer­ing a range of one to five stu­dios each and are owned by peo­ple who love mu­sic or are mu­si­cians them­selves.</p>
    <p>While some have per­ma­nently shut­tered, oth­ers have had to in­no­vate and of­fer new ser­vices such as live stream­ing.</p>
    <p>Jam­ming stu­dios were among the busi­nesses closed when the cir­cuit breaker started in April. They were al­lowed to open again in June, but with new re­stric­tions. For ex­am­ple, the equip­ment has to be reg­u­larly dis­in­fected and mu­si­cians must ad­here to so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
    <p>With live en­ter­tain­ment still cur­tailed to pre­vent the spread of Covid-19, fewer bands need to rent space for re­hearsals and mu­sic lessons.</p>
    <p>Mo­hamed Noor, one of the lo­cal scene’s most sought-af­ter per­cus­sion­ists, says that mu­si­cians are find­ing it hard to hire stu­dios be­cause they are earn­ing less dur­ing the pan­demic. “My in­come from mu­sic is only 20 per cent of what I used to earn be­fore the pan­demic,” says the 53-year-old.</p>
    <p>Jam­ming stu­dios are es­sen­tial to the mu­sic ecosys­tem here.</p>
    <p>Singer and song­writer Rai Kannu, 42, one-half of singing duo Jack & Rai, says they have played an im­por­tant role in his de­vel­op­ment as a mu­si­cian.</p>
    <p>“The rite of pas­sage for any band’s live de­but is to jam to­gether. The jam stu­dio has al­ways been an en­tity that ex­ists to grow that in­ter­est in mu­sic and co­he­sion as a band. As a kid, I used to go reg­u­larly to Wee Lee Mu­sic Cen­tre, which ex­ists till to­day.”</p>
    <p>Stu­dio owner and mu­si­cian Bani Rah­man, 49, adds: “In Sin­ga­pore, we can’t play our in­stru­ments loud at home be­cause we might dis­turb the neigh­bours, which is why jam­ming stu­dios are so im­por­tant to us.</p>
    <p>“It’s also more than just a room for us to play, it’s a com­mu­nity space for mu­si­cians to gather and so­cialise.”</p>
    <p>The bassist runs Epic Stu­dio at Penin­sula Shop­ping Cen­tre. While he is re­lieved that he re­ceived three months of ren­tal re­bates for the two units that he rented from two dif­fer­ent land­lords, in­come is still tight as he had to pay main­te­nance fees to one of the land­lords while the stu­dio was closed dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>For Tone­house Stu­dios in Park­lane Shop­ping Mall, the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod was a chance for it to ex­plore new ven­tures.</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor Mah Chen Zhong started a pod­cast while the stu­dio was closed. And when it re­opened, it started of­fer­ing live-stream­ing ser­vices for mu­si­cians.</p>
    <p>The stu­dio also started its own on­line gig se­ries, Tone­house Live Ses­sions, as well as Tone­house Live Stream­ing Ses­sions, a project in which bands cover made-in-Sin­ga­pore songs and talk about why they liked them.</p>
    <p>The 31-year-old says: “The ini­tial in­vest­ment into live-stream­ing equip­ment was steep, but it is pay­ing off.</p>
    <p>“More im­por­tantly, the big pic­ture is about pro­vid­ing a qual­ity venue for mu­si­cians to con­tinue to per­form and keep the mar­ket go­ing. We feel grate­ful that we’re able to play a small role in keep­ing things go­ing for the arts and mu­sic scene.”</p>
    <p>The Base­ment Stu­dio in Golden Mile Tower is an­other stu­dio that has re­vamped its busi­ness in the wake of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It be­gan of­fer­ing live-stream­ing ser­vices to mu­si­cians. Owner Mo­hamed Yazzit Mo­hamed Is­mail has also started or­gan­is­ing on­line gigs at the stu­dio. View­ers are en­cour­aged to pay the per­form­ers via Buy Me A Cof­fee, an on­line plat­form that lets fans pro­vide mone­tary sup­port to cre­ators.</p>
    <p>The 40-year-old’s plan is for The Base­ment Stu­dio to evolve from a jam­ming stu­dio to a record la­bel over the next one year. “We want to do more live-stream shows as well as dis­cover and pro­mote new tal­ent.”</p>
    <p>MR MAH CHEN ZHONG, di­rec­tor of Tone­house Stu­dios, which has started an on­line gig se­ries as well as live-stream­ing ses­sions of made-in-Sin­ga­pore songs</p>
    <p>Still, for many jam­ming stu­dios in Sin­ga­pore, busi­ness is only about half of what it was be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“It’s been very hard for me,” says Mr Sam Ng, who op­er­ates Wee Lee Mu­sic Cen­tre, a jam­ming stu­dio in Alju­nied that was started in 1983.</p>
    <p>“Mu­si­cians are out of a job so they don’t come here to prac­tise.”</p>
    <p>He has had to let go of his three staff dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod when the stu­dio was closed. The 53-year-old now op­er­ates the stu­dio alone.</p>
    <p>“I give my­self un­til the end of De­cem­ber, and if busi­ness does not im­prove, I might have to wind up.”</p>
    <p>An­other busi­ness owner who was af­fected, Mr Hafiz John Dzulk­i­fli, had to down­size his mu­sic busi­ness in March.</p>
    <p>His com­pany, What’s Your Jam?, used to have a unit that com­prised jam­ming stu­dios, a mu­sic school and re­tail shop in Kam­pong Bahru Road.</p>
    <p>He closed down the two-yearold jam­ming stu­dios and re­lo­cated to a smaller space in the same area that is used only for mu­sic lessons.</p>
    <p>“My part­ners and I did our cal­cu­la­tions and since there were fewer peo­ple com­ing to jam, we de­cided to close down the jam­ming stu­dios to pre­vent fur­ther losses.”</p>
    <p>For gig-starved mu­si­cians like Martin Reyes, leader of Latin mu­sic group Martin Reyes Band, the lo­cal stu­dios’ new ser­vices help­ing them take their mu­sic on­line are much wel­comed.</p>
    <p>On Sept 19, his six-mem­ber band, which used to play at pri­vate events as well as venues like The Fuller­ton Ho­tel Sin­ga­pore, will be do­ing a tick­eted on­line per­for­mance that will be live-streamed from The Base­ment Stu­dio. It will be their first per­for­mance since Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>“The whole en­ter­tain­ment scene has been af­fected by the pan­demic so we have to find cre­ative ways to gen­er­ate in­come,” says the 43-year-old. “Be­ing able to do livestream shows at the stu­dio helps us to keep in con­tact with our crowd, the peo­ple who miss our live per­for­mances.”</p>
