    <p>NEW YORK • Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den on Wed­nes­day la­belled Mr Don­ald Trump the first racist to be­come US pres­i­dent in re­marks his Repub­li­can op­po­nent’s re-elec­tion cam­paign quickly re­buked.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, who was vice-pres­i­dent un­der Mr Barack Obama, the first US black pres­i­dent, fielded a ques­tion at a Ser­vice Em­ploy­ees In­ter­na­tional Union round-ta­ble event from a health­care worker con­cerned about Mr Trump call­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic the “China virus”.</p>
    <p>He re­sponded by say­ing it was “ab­so­lutely sick­en­ing” how Mr Trump “deals with peo­ple based on the colour of their skin, their na­tional ori­gin, where they’re from”.</p>
    <p>He added: “No sit­ting pres­i­dent has ever done this. Never, never, never. No Repub­li­can pres­i­dent has done this. No Demo­cratic pres­i­dent. We’ve had racists, and they’ve ex­isted, and they’ve tried to get elected pres­i­dent. He’s the first one that has.”</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign se­nior ad­viser Ka­t­rina Pier­son fired back, call­ing Mr Bi­den’s com­ments “an in­sult to the in­tel­li­gence of black vot­ers” given the one-time se­na­tor’s past work with seg­re­ga­tion­ist law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of US pres­i­dents owned slaves or sup­ported racist poli­cies in­clud­ing the re­pres­sion of na­tive Amer­i­cans and seg­re­ga­tion of black Amer­i­cans. Prince­ton Univer­sity said last month it was drop­ping for­mer pres­i­dent Woodrow Wil­son’s name from the school, cit­ing his racist think­ing and poli­cies.</p>
    <p>The Bi­den-Trump ex­change marks an es­ca­la­tion in what had al­ready been a heated clash on race in the cam­paign be­ing waged be­tween the two can­di­dates ahead of their Nov 3 elec­tion con­test.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has pre­vi­ously crit­i­cised Mr Trump for stok­ing racial divi­sion, say­ing he was mo­ti­vated to run for of­fice by his out­rage over Mr Trump’s as­sess­ment that “both sides” were to blame for vi­o­lence be­tween white su­prem­a­cists and counter-pro­test­ers at a 2017 rally in Vir­ginia.</p>
    <p>Race be­came an even more cen­tral is­sue as protests raged over un­armed African Amer­i­cans be­ing killed by po­lice in the af­ter­math of the May death of Mr Ge­orge Floyd, a black man who died af­ter a white po­lice of­fi­cer used his knee to press his neck into the pave­ment for over eight min­utes.</p>
