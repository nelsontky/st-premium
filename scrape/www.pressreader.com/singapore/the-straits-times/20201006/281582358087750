    <p>The at­tacker in a 2016 fa­tal as­sault in Yishun was yes­ter­day sen­tenced to four years’ jail. District Judge Tan Jen Tse had ear­lier found Ryan Xavier Tay Seet Choong, now 24, guilty of vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing griev­ous hurt to Mr Shawn Ig­natius Ro­driguez, 26, who died af­ter the at­tack on July 9, 2016.</p>
    <p>The at­tacker in a 2016 fa­tal as­sault in Yishun was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to four years’ jail.</p>
    <p>District Judge Tan Jen Tse had last month found Ryan Xavier Tay Seet Choong, now 24, guilty of vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing griev­ous hurt to Mr Shawn Ig­natius Ro­driguez, 26, who died af­ter the at­tack on July 9, 2016.</p>
    <p>Judge Tan had also found Tay’s step­fa­ther Lawrence Lim Peck Beng, now 59, guilty of abet­ting his step­son in com­mit­ting the of­fence. Lim was sen­tenced to eight months’ jail yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Be­fore hand­ing down the sen­tences, Judge Tan said the at­tack on Mr Ro­driguez was “sus­tained and pro­longed”. But he noted that Mr Ro­driguez had “in­ces­santly ha­rassed” the pair and their fam­ily, caus­ing dis­tress.</p>
    <p>Tay and Lim had taken mat­ters into their own hands in 2016 af­ter Mr Ro­driguez per­sisted in vis­it­ing their flat even af­ter the fam­ily lodged more than 50 po­lice re­ports against him.</p>
    <p>Things took a tragic turn on July 9 that year when Tay as­saulted Mr Ro­driguez, who later died of trau­matic as­phyxia with a head in­jury. Mr Ro­driguez was do­ing his na­tional ser­vice with the Re­pub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Air Force at the time.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tors Wong Kok Weng, Jason Chua and Chong Kee En had stated in their sub­mis­sions that Mr Ro­driguez and Tay knew each other in 2006 when they were al­tar boys at the Church of Our Lady Star of the Sea in Yishun.</p>
    <p>But Tay left eight years later as he felt that Mr Ro­driguez was “fix­ated” with him.</p>
    <p>Mr Ro­driguez then tried to con­tact Tay by mak­ing fre­quent phone calls, and started loitering around the void deck of Tay’s home in Block 279 Yishun Street 22.</p>
    <p>Mr Ro­driguez went to the block on July 9, 2016.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tors had ear­lier said: “At about 7.40pm, (Mr Ro­driguez) re­turned. Lawrence opened the door and shouted at (him) for about five minutes and opened the gate in­tend­ing to phys­i­cally en­gage him.</p>
    <p>“At this junc­ture, Ryan came out of the unit and (Mr Ro­driguez) started to run away. Ryan chased (him) down the cor­ri­dor and up the stair­case at lift land­ing B.”</p>
    <p>A scuf­fle broke out and Mr Ro­driguez was re­strained. The po­lice later ar­rived at the scene and a Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force para­medic pro­nounced him dead at around 8.30pm.</p>
    <p>Tay and Lim were each of­fered bail of $15,000 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>They will have to sur­ren­der them­selves at the State Courts on Oct 20 to be­gin serv­ing their sen­tences.</p>
