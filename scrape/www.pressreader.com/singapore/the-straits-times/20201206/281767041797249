    <p>LON­DON/BRUS­SELS • Bri­tish and Euro­pean Union ne­go­tia­tors paused trade talks on Fri­day to call in their lead­ers to try to nar­row gaps and get an agree­ment over the line, less than four weeks be­fore Bri­tain com­pletes its Brexit jour­ney out of the bloc.</p>
    <p>Af­ter fail­ing to agree the ba­sis for a deal, Bri­tain’s Mr David Frost and the EU’s Mr Michel Barnier said they would brief their lead­ers to seek new im­pe­tus for the talks, which stum­bled last Thurs­day when Lon­don ac­cused Brus­sels of mak­ing new de­mands.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son and Euro­pean Com­mis­sion pres­i­dent Ur­sula von der Leyen were due to try yes­ter­day to break the im­passe, which sources said was cen­tred on French de­mands over fish­ing rights in Bri­tish waters.</p>
    <p>It is the lat­est twist in the months-long ne­go­ti­a­tions which have barely moved on the three thorni­est is­sues – fish­eries, en­sur­ing fair com­pe­ti­tion guar­an­tees and ways to solve fu­ture dis­putes.</p>
    <p>But so far, nei­ther side has walked away from the talks, sug­gest­ing that both are still hold­ing out some hope of se­cur­ing a deal gov­ern­ing al­most US$1 tril­lion (S$1.3 tril­lion) of an­nual trade to avoid a disor­derly end to more than 40 years of Bri­tish mem­ber­ship of the Euro­pean club.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter one week of in­tense ne­go­ti­a­tions in Lon­don, the two chief ne­go­tia­tors agreed to­day that the con­di­tions for an agree­ment are not met, due to sig­nif­i­cant di­ver­gences on level play­ing field, gov­er­nance and fish­eries,” they said in a state­ment on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“On this ba­sis, they agreed to pause in or­der to brief their prin­ci­pals on the state of play of the ne­go­ti­a­tions. Pres­i­dent von der Leyen and Prime Min­is­ter John­son will dis­cuss the state of play to­mor­row af­ter­noon.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier on Fri­day, there were con­tra­dic­tory re­ports of how far the talks had pro­gressed, with some EU of­fi­cials say­ing they were very close to reach­ing an agree­ment while Bri­tish of­fi­cials said the ne­go­ti­a­tions had reached a very dif­fi­cult point.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, it will be for the politi­cians to de­cide whether they want to shift the ne­go­ti­at­ing po­si­tions and com­pro­mise to find grounds for a deal, or to walk away.</p>
    <p>The EU has chal­lenged Bri­tain to de­cide what fu­ture it wants for it­self out­side the bloc’s sin­gle mar­ket and Cus­toms union.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain for­mally left the EU on Jan 31, but since then, has been in a tran­si­tion pe­riod un­der which rules on trade, travel and busi­ness re­main un­changed.</p>
    <p>If the two sides fail to reach a deal, the five-year Brexit divorce will end mess­ily j ust as Europe grap­ples with the vast eco­nomic cost of the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>A no-deal exit is the night­mare sce­nario for busi­nesses and in­vestors, who say such an out­come would snarl bor­ders, spook fi­nan­cial mar­kets and sow chaos through sup­ply chains that stretch across Europe and be­yond.</p>
    <p>The dis­cus­sions soured last Thurs­day when a Bri­tish gov­ern­ment source said the EU had dis­rupted talks by try­ing to force fur­ther con­ces­sions and France, which fears los­ing many of its rights to fish in Bri­tish waters, warned it might rebel.</p>
    <p>The EU has de­nied mak­ing new de­mands.</p>
    <p>French Euro­pean Af­fairs Min­is­ter Cle­ment Beaune told Europe 1 ra­dio there was still a risk that talks would fail. But he added: “I want to tell our fish­er­men, our pro­duc­ers, the ci­ti­zens who are lis­ten­ing that we will not ac­cept a deal with bad terms. If a good agree­ment can­not be reached, we will op­pose it. Each coun­try has a veto right, so it is pos­si­ble... We will do our own eval­u­a­tion of this draft deal, if there is one.”</p>
