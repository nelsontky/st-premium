    <p>This sea­son’s Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion play-offs, start­ing to­day, are seen as the tough­est ever – with no home-court ad­van­tage and men­tal fa­tigue for play­ers, who will be away from home longer as their teams progress. But while a record eight teams re­al­is­ti­cally stand a chance, the Mil­wau­kee Bucks and Los An­ge­les Lak­ers are still the ones to watch.</p>
    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • A Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) sea­son un­like any other moves into high gear to­day with the start of the play-offs in the league’s quar­an­tine “bub­ble” at Dis­ney World.</p>
    <p>In a sea­son re­shaped by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, home-court ad­van­tage is just a mem­ory.</p>
    <p>Fans are banned from the cam­pus where the league has so far suc­cess­fully op­er­ated without a pos­i­tive Covid-19 test since its restart last month.</p>
    <p>But the price is that play­ers know that the deeper their teams’ post­sea­son run, the longer they re­main iso­lated from their fam­i­lies and friends.</p>
    <p>“This is go­ing to be the tough­est cham­pi­onship you could ever win,” Mil­wau­kee Bucks for­ward Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo, the reign­ing Most Valu­able Player, said ahead of his top-seeded team’s first-round meet­ing with the Or­lando Magic.</p>
    <p>Hous­ton Rock­ets guard Austin Rivers agrees with that as­sess­ment.</p>
    <p>“Who­ever wins this year re­ally had to go get it and earn it, and had guys who took time off se­ri­ously and still stayed in shape, and was able to get back the chem­istry, true chem­istry,” he said.</p>
    <p>Rock­ets gen­eral man­ager Daryl Morey added: “We have a his­toric sit­u­a­tion we’re all fac­ing. I count eight teams that can win it. When does that ever hap­pen?”</p>
    <p>At 56-17, the Bucks own the best record in the league, as they have for two years in a row, and will be the favourites against the Magic (33-40), who they swept in the reg­u­lar sea­son.</p>
    <p>While their form since en­ter­ing the “bub­ble” has been lack­lus­tre, go­ing 3-5 record since the restart, An­te­tok­oun­mpo feels Mil­wau­kee can re­turn to their pre-shut­down form.</p>
    <p>“Now it’s play-off time,” he said. “I def­i­nitely don’t be­lieve in the turn-on switch that ev­ery­body talks about, like we can turn on the switch and be great, but I do be­lieve that if ev­ery­body is on the same page and if ev­ery­one is fo­cused and get to­gether... I be­lieve we can play way, way bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>The West­ern Con­fer­ence-lead­ing Los An­ge­les Lak­ers, back in the play-offs for the first time in seven sea­sons, have also gone an unim­pres­sive 3-5 in seed­ing games.</p>
    <p>LeBron James, An­thony Davis and Co – in­spired this sea­son by the mem­ory of Lak­ers great Kobe Bryant who died in a he­li­copter crash in Jan­uary – will be up against the bat­tle-hard­ened and ex­pe­ri­enced Port­land to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>The Trail Blaz­ers (35-39) won four suc­ces­sive down-to-the-wire games – in­clud­ing the maiden playin tour­na­ment against the Griz­zlies on Satur­day – to grab the fi­nal play­off berth.</p>
    <p>After pac­ing his team with 31 points in the 126-122 vic­tory over Mem­phis, Blaz­ers guard Damian Lil­lard, who was named the league’s top player of the restart, fired a warn­ing to the Lak­ers (52-19) that they had no in­ten­tion of go­ing home early.</p>
    <p>“We can beat any­body, so now we just gotta get rested and get ready for the next thing,” he said. “You know our work is just be­gin­ning.</p>
    <p>“( The Lak­ers) are the No. 1 seed for a rea­son. But at the same time, we didn’t fight as hard as we fought in the ‘bub­ble’ to just say, ‘All right, we’re the eighth seed’, and just go out there and get beat up on. We feel like we have a chance in a se­ries against any­one in this league.”</p>

The Blaz&#xAD;ers won 126-122 to clinch the fi&#xAD;nal spot in the play-offs, in which teams do without home-court ad&#xAD;van&#xAD;tage and play&#xAD;ers are away from home longer the fur&#xAD;ther their teams progress.</p>
