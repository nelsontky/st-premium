    <p>• Hav­ing trav­elled to Real Madrid with­out 10 of his first-team play­ers last month, it is lit­tle won­der Luis Cas­tro rates Shakhtar Donetsk’s 2-1 win in the Cham­pi­ons League as one of his “great­est as a coach”.</p>
    <p>Not only was it the first time the vis­i­tors had de­feated Real but it was also just the se­cond time a Ukrainian side had done so since Dy­namo Kiev’s up­set in 1999.</p>
    <p>Things have not gone so swim­mingly since – con­sec­u­tive losses to Group B lead­ers and Bun­desliga out­fit Borussia Monchengla­d­bach, who are on eight points, mean they re­main out­siders to qual­ify for the knock­out phase for just the se­cond time in his­tory and the first since the 2017-18 sea­son. Real need one win from two games to se­cure pas­sage to the last 16.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a vic­tory for the hosts to­day will change the com­plex­ion. It would en­able Shakhtar to move level with the Span­ish cham­pi­ons on seven points. Real’s last group game will be at home to Monchengla­d­bach.</p>
    <p>Pro­gres­sion re­mains an up­hill task as 13-time Euro­pean Cham­pi­ons Real want to seal their place in the next round as soon as they can to fo­cus on the league, but Cas­tro be­lieves his side can shock Zine­dine Zi­dane’s men again.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing heart from Real’s poor form in La Liga – they have lost three of their past five home games – he told Span­ish daily Marca: “It hap­pens ev­ery week­end, the big teams seem un­sta­ble.</p>
    <p>“One day, they have a great game with a great per­for­mance and then the next day, the level is not good. This is a con­clu­sion of mine drawn from the re­sults that the teams are show­ing. This Cham­pi­ons League group is very strong... But we do not stop hav­ing hope and in this game against Madrid, many things will be de­ter­mined.</p>
    <p>“It is a very com­plex job that we have ahead of us but we have our hopes. We al­ways want to present a strat­egy that can cause sur­prise, that Madrid can fail with, and that we can be suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>“There are still pos­si­bil­i­ties for the four (teams in­clud­ing In­ter Mi­lan). I think the group will be de­cided on the last day. But of course, if Madrid win, they will qual­ify and we will play (for the) Europa League on the last day.”</p>
    <p>Real re­vealed their trav­el­ling squad yes­ter­day, leav­ing out the likes of cap­tain Ser­gio Ramos and Marco Asen­sio, both in­jured.</p>
    <p>The club also con­firmed the ex­tent of Eden Hazard’s seventh in­jury since join­ing last sum­mer.</p>
    <p>The Bel­gium for­ward, who suf­fered an­other prob­lem over the week­end, has al­ready missed a to­tal of 37 games and will be out for an­other three weeks. Zi­dane had some pos­i­tive news with top scorer Karim Ben­zema passed fit fol­low­ing a three-game ab­sence.</p>
