    <p>Re­bekah Vardy, the wife of Le­ices­ter striker Jamie, won the first ex­change in her li­bel case against the wife of his for­mer in­ter­na­tional team­mate Wayne Rooney over ac­cu­sa­tions she passed on sto­ries to a news­pa­per about her for­mer friend.</p>
    <p>Vardy is su­ing Coleen Rooney at Lon­don’s High Court for ac­cus­ing her on Twit­ter and In­sta­gram of leak­ing sto­ries from her pri­vate life to The Sun. Both women be­long to a glam­orous group of foot­ballers’ wives and girl­friends, known in Bri­tain as the WAGs.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber last year, Rooney, whose hus­band is Eng­land’s record goalscorer and for­mer cap­tain, said she had care­fully planned and ex­e­cuted a sting op­er­a­tion to see who was leak­ing sto­ries about her, and that her de­tec­tive work had worked out who was</p>
    <p>Coleen Rooney (left) and Re­bekah Vardy have been em­broiled in a trial dubbed the “WA­Gatha Christie” case.</p>
    <p>re­spon­si­ble. The end of the mes­sage said: “I have saved and screen­shot­ted all the orig­i­nal sto­ries which clearly show just one per­son has viewed them. It’s... Re­bekah Vardy’s ac­count.”</p>
    <p>But Vardy, 38, de­nied the ac­cu­sa­tion. “I don’t need the money, what would I gain from sell­ing sto­ries on you?” the model replied.</p>
    <p>The li­bel trial kicked off on Thurs­day with both par­ties ar­gu­ing about the “nat­u­ral and or­di­nary” mean­ing of the words at the cen­tre of the dis­pute.</p>
    <p>Vardy’s lawyers said they should be taken to mean Vardy her­self had con­sis­tently be­trayed Rooney’s trust over sev­eral years. Rooney’s lawyers ar­gued ref­er­ence to “Re­bekah Vardy’s ac­count”, stopped short of as­sert­ing Vardy’s un­equiv­o­cal guilt.</p>
    <p>Judge Mark Warby, in his judg­ment, said: “The reader’s nat­u­ral in­fer­ence would be that the mis­cre­ant was Ms Vardy her­self. There is no in­di­ca­tion to the con­trary.” He also or­dered Rooney to pay Vardy just un­der £23,000 (S$41,000) in costs for Thurs­day’s hear­ing.</p>
    <p>The core of Rooney’s de­fence, that her post was jus­ti­fied be­cause its con­tent was true, will be ex­am­ined dur­ing a full trial at a later date.</p>
