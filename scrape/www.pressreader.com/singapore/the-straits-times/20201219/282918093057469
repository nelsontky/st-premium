    <p>A new vir­tual pay­ment card is­sued by a Sin­ga­pore start-up will en­able cash­less pay­ments any­where in China with­out hav­ing to set up a bank ac­count there.</p>
    <p>Aleta Planet, a China-cen­tric fin­tech firm started by Sin­ga­porean Ryan Gwee, yes­ter­day of­fi­cially launched its AP-1 vir­tual card for QR code or con­tact­less pay­ments through UnionPay, a global pay­ment brand ac­cepted at over 52 mil­lion mer­chants world­wide.</p>
    <p>Aleta Planet’s AP-1 is one of a few for­eign vir­tual cards that can be widely used in China for big and small trans­ac­tions. China’s cash­less so­ci­ety has of­ten been a challenge for vis­i­tors, with many mer­chants not ac­cept­ing in­ter­na­tional credit cards or cash. Pay­ment is made from lo­cal bank ac­counts us­ing mo­bile pay­ments via QR codes.</p>
    <p>But many for­eign­ers do not have lo­cal bank ac­counts. Ac­cord­ing to Mr Gwee, who is Aleta Planet’s chief ex­ec­u­tive and chair­man, AP-1 can solve th­ese is­sues.</p>
    <p>“Us­ing the AP-1 wal­let, Sin­ga­pore­ans and other vis­i­tors can pay and pur­chase any­where in China like a lo­cal,” he said.</p>
    <p>He ex­plained that AP-1 users can lever­age the ubiq­ui­tous net­work of UnionPay for var­i­ous trans­ac­tions, in­clud­ing buy­ing street food, tak­ing taxis and book­ing air tick­ets.</p>
    <p>AP-1 users can also en­joy sig­nif­i­cant sav­ings through the com­pet­i­tive and di­rect ex­change rates from UnionPay, Mr Gwee added.</p>
    <p>“AP-1 is uniquely placed to sup­port for­eign­ers be­cause it taps into the pay­ment net­work of UnionPay, a lead­ing global pay­ment brand,” he said. “As bor­ders grad­u­ally open, users will find AP-1 an easy, con­ve­nient and se­cure way of spend­ing like a lo­cal in China. For now, they can still ben­e­fit from re­mit­ting funds to UnionPay card­hold­ers within 60 sec­onds and en­joy ex­clu­sive UnionPay re­wards and pro­mo­tions in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Ali­pay and WeChat wal­lets also al­low tourists to use pay­ment sys­tems in China. But their use is lim­ited to three months and a max­i­mum of</p>
    <p>2,000 yuan (S$410). AP-1 has no such lim­its on time or amount.</p>
    <p>AP-1 can also be used at re­tail­ers in Sin­ga­pore that ac­cept UnionPay’s QR code or Mo­bile Quick­pass.</p>
    <p>Aleta Planet is the lat­est fin­tech to en­ter the US$100 tril­lion (S$133 tril­lion) global pay­ment ser­vices mar­ket which has tra­di­tion­ally been con­trolled by banks.</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies such as Alibaba, Ap­ple, So­ramitsu and scores of oth­ers around the world have been dis­rupt­ing this lu­cra­tive mar­ket by rolling out prod­ucts cater­ing to a more tech-savvy pop­u­lace who pre­fer cash­less pay­ment wal­lets at home and abroad. Most of th­ese pay­ment sys­tems have been cheaper and faster than the bank-owned legacy sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Mr Gwee, who worked at Stan­dard Char­tered Bank in China for al­most two decades, gath­ered a team of bank­ing and tech­nol­ogy spe­cial­ists to start up Aleta Planet in 2014. Ini­tially, it fo­cused on cross-bor­der busi­ness-to-busi­ness dig­i­tal pay­ments through the UnionPay net­work, but has now ex­panded into busi­ness-to-con­sumer ser­vice of­fer­ings.</p>
    <p>As a cer­ti­fied prin­ci­pal mem­ber of UnionPay In­ter­na­tional, Aleta Planet en­ables mer­chants to ac­cept more than 8.4 bil­lion UnionPay cards is­sued glob­ally. It also plans to is­sue UnionPay com­mer­cial and re­tail cards.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, Aleta Planet launched a re­mit­tance ser­vice on UnionPay’s MoneyEx­press net­work to en­able the es­ti­mated 380,000 Chi­nese na­tion­als work­ing in Sin­ga­pore to safely and quickly send money back to China.</p>
    <p>It also an­nounced its part­ner­ship with one-stop life­style app Nes­tia to al­low its over 600,000 reg­is­tered mem­bers to make both off­line and online pay­ments us­ing a UnionPay vir­tual card.</p>
