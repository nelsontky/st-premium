    <p>Imag­ine a beau­ti­ful beach where fam­i­lies are gath­ered on a clear day with blue skies. Dif­fer­ent fam­i­lies are build­ing sand­cas­tles, while some are play­ing on the beach. No one is watch­ing that a tsunami of dif­fer­ent waves is ap­proach­ing the shore.</p>
    <p>This is the vivid story told by for­mer United Na­tions</p>
    <p>Frame­work Con­ven­tion on Cli­mate Change ex­ec­u­tive sec­re­tary Chris­tiana Figueres.</p>
    <p>The first wave is the pandemic, fol­lowed by eco­nomic re­ces­sion, then fi­nan­cial cri­sis and, fi­nally, the big wave of cli­mate warm­ing.</p>
    <p>Why are peo­ple and politi­cians still build­ing sand­cas­tles and look­ing the other way?</p>
    <p>The more in­trigu­ing ques­tion is: What sand­cas­tles are still be­ing built? One is called democ­racy. An­other is called free­dom.</p>
    <p>In the com­ing weeks, we shall wit­ness the out­come of the elec­tion of the cen­tury.</p>
    <p>Since the 2008 fi­nan­cial cri­sis, many have lamented that democ­racy has been on the re­treat. Elec­toral democ­racy is founded on the idea that each so­ci­ety chooses its own lead­ers through a one-ci­ti­zen-one-vote system. Abuses of lead­er­ship are checked and bal­anced through the Mon­tesquieu trin­ity of ex­ec­u­tive, ju­di­ciary and leg­is­la­ture. But with the emer­gence of Brexit, Euro­pean pop­ulists and United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump by 2016, the game be­came uglier, as po­lit­i­cal and so­cial views be­came po­larised as wealth and so­cial in­equal­i­ties widened.</p>
    <p>Even as land and stock mar­ket prices rose when in­ter­est rates went near zero, politi­cians sleep­walked through the seis­mic shift in so­cial con­di­tions as the bot­tom half of so­ci­ety be­came inse­cure from loss of jobs to technology, glob­al­i­sa­tion and ris­ing lev­els of im­mi­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>Cen­trist mod­er­ates were seen by both the ex­treme left and right as hav­ing sold out to the pow­er­ful, and pol­i­tics be­came more rigged, frac­tious and con­tested.</p>
    <p>Will build­ing the democ­racy sand­cas­tle bet­ter at this point of time stop the tsunami crash­ing down on all of us? Surely the is­sue is to run and fight an­other day?</p>
    <p>When the tsunami comes, all sand­cas­tles will be swept away and there may not even be a beach any­more. But some will sur­vive and the re­build­ing must be­gin.</p>
    <p>This is where the free­dom sand­cas­tle plays a crit­i­cal role.</p>
    <p>In­di­vid­ual free­dom is an an­chor of the Western value system, now spread through glob­al­i­sa­tion. But in­di­vid­ual free­dom comes with so­cial obli­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>The pandemic posed this dilemma in sharp fo­cus.</p>
    <p>Many Amer­i­cans and Bri­tish feel that wear­ing a mask im­pinges on their in­di­vid­ual free­dom, but not do­ing so and not fol­low­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules have cost both so­ci­eties more than 220,000 and 44,000 Covid-19 deaths re­spec­tively and ris­ing.</p>
    <p>On the as­sump­tion that each life costs US$10 mil­lion</p>
    <p>(S$13.6 mil­lion), the cost to both so­ci­eties so far is about</p>
    <p>US$2.2 tril­lion and US$440 billion re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mist Larry Sum­mers has cal­cu­lated that the to­tal cost of this pandemic so far is</p>
    <p>US$16 tril­lion for the US econ­omy, or nearly three-quar­ters of last year’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct.</p>
    <p>We can­not blame democ­racy or free­dom for such loss of life.</p>
    <p>East Asian economies, from Ja­pan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia, Thai­land and Viet­nam (com­bined 2,552 deaths as of Oct 21), have shown that dif­fer­ent sys­tems can pro­duce bet­ter pandemic man­age­ment re­sults than, say, Swe­den (5,929 deaths), with a pop­u­la­tion that is 39 times larger.</p>
    <p>We have not yet beaten Covid-19, as the virus is mu­tat­ing as it spreads. Vac­cines may be com­ing, but their us­age will not be wide­spread till next year.</p>
    <p>Win­ter is com­ing and death rates will in­crease as the sea­sonal in­fluenza at­tacks.</p>
    <p>More than ever, we should be pre­pared when the sec­ond and third waves of eco­nomic dis­tress, un­em­ploy­ment and bank­rupt­cies (all tem­po­rar­ily cov­ered up by sub­si­dies and debt for­give­ness) surface by spring next year.</p>
    <p>So why are we still build­ing sand­cas­tles as the waves crash down?</p>
    <p>All this boils down to human psy­chol­ogy and re­ac­tion to un­knowns.</p>
    <p>De­pend­ing on ex­pe­ri­ence and knowl­edge, as the 2004 In­dian Ocean tsunami showed, some may still wan­der down to the beach to fig­ure out what is go­ing on.</p>
    <p>There were al­most 230,000 deaths then, but not ev­ery­one ran for their own lives.</p>
    <p>Many were brave enough to save oth­ers. Some stayed to help many oth­ers flee.</p>
    <p>Clearly, those who deny the tsunami have an ed­u­ca­tion prob­lem, which sim­ply boils down to a moral is­sue.</p>
    <p>Is your in­di­vid­ual free­dom so im­por­tant that you deny that this could put your loved ones and many other peo­ple at risk?</p>
    <p>It is not just a health is­sue, the dam­age to the econ­omy will be even more dev­as­tat­ing. Cen­tral banks print­ing money can­not stem the losses, be­cause they do not ad­dress struc­tural is­sues ex­posed by the pandemic.</p>
    <p>De­nial, blam­ing oth­ers, sheer in­com­pe­tence and un­will­ing­ness to work with one an­other at all lev­els of so­ci­ety in the face of dis­as­ter have been hall­marks of those economies most dev­as­tated by the pandemic. All th­ese show that while the sci­ence-based ap­proach is val­i­dated by the health cri­sis, human be­ings do not de­cide by facts alone.</p>
    <p>Our eco­nomic mod­els based on dol­lars and cents can­not mea­sure the agony of the masses when they lose their jobs, health and dig­nity.</p>
    <p>At the heart of human choice is ul­ti­mately a moral is­sue. Do you care only for your­self, or do you care more about other peo­ple and Mother Na­ture?</p>
    <p>This is why the US elec­tion is ul­ti­mately a moral test, not a demo­cratic or free­dom is­sue. This elec­tion could be fair, rigged or legally con­tested.</p>
    <p>Ir­re­spec­tive of who wins, and whether the elec­tion will re­sult in a con­sti­tu­tional cri­sis re­quir­ing Supreme Court de­ci­sions, the test is how in­di­vid­u­als in­volved – the vot­ers, pres­i­den­tial can­di­dates, Supreme Court judges or At­tor­ney-Gen­eral – de­cide on their per­sonal sense of moral val­ues. Their de­ci­sions in the com­ing days will have far-reach­ing con­se­quences for them­selves and the rest of us.</p>
    <p>We will soon know whether we have four more years of sham­bolic chaos or per­haps a pe­riod of healing af­ter the pandemic. God bless Amer­ica and pray for us all.</p>
