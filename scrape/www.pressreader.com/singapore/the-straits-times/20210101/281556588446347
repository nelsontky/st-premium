    <p>The pan­demic ham­mered South-east Asian stock mar­kets last year, with the Straits Times In­dex tak­ing the big­gest hit in the re­gion.

    <p>The pan­demic ham­mered South­east Asian stock mar­kets last year, with the Straits Times In­dex (STI) tak­ing the big­gest hit in re­gion.</p>
    <p>The lo­cal bourse ended the year down nearly 12 per cent, a vic­tim, like its re­gional peers, of the greater re­liance on trade, travel and tourism – sec­tors that were all un­der siege as coun­tries went into lock­downs.</p>
    <p>These mar­kets also have a lim­ited ex­po­sure to heavy­weights in the on­line and tech­nol­ogy fields, which have thrived amid the pan­demic, an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>Take Internet firm Sea, the par­ent of e-com­merce plat­form Shopee. While it may not be a house­hold name among many in­vestors, Sea sur­passed DBS Group Hold­ings in July to be­come Sin­ga­pore’s most valu­able home­grown pub­lic com­pany.</p>
    <p>The New York-listed firm along­side Chi­nese elec­tric ve­hi­cle maker BYD and e-com­merce plat­form Pin­duo­duo were among Asia’s big­gest stock win­ners as in­vestors flocked to com­pa­nies with op­er­a­tions in en­ter­prise soft­ware, cloud com­put­ing, e-com­merce, dig­i­tal en­ter­tain­ment and gam­ing.</p>
    <p>But in­vestors are bet­ting that things could get bullish as the Year of the Rat gives way to the Ox in the light of the vac­cine roll-out, the sign­ing of the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship and hopes of a more mul­ti­lat­eral trade ap­proach by the in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion in the United States.</p>
    <p>Any news will seem like good news af­ter a hair-rais­ing 12 months.</p>
    <p>The low point came be­tween Fe­bru­ary and March when the STI plunged more than 32 per cent as lo­cal and global eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity took a sharp hit from the pan­demic and en­su­ing lock­downs.</p>
    <p>It was only in Novem­ber that the</p>
    <p>STI be­gan to re­cover more strongly when in­sti­tu­tional in­vestors bought more than $1.53 bil­lion worth of lo­cal shares in that month alone on news of pos­i­tive vac­cine tri­als and signs that US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s tran­si­tion to the White House was un­der way.</p>
    <p>This marked a stark turn­around from the first 10 months of the year when they were net sellers of nearly $7.1 bil­lion worth of Sin­ga­pore shares.</p>
    <p>The late buy­ing ac­tiv­ity helped the STI re­coup more than 27 per cent from a year low of 2,233.48 on March 23 to end 2020 at 2,843.81 points, down al­most 12 per cent on the year.</p>
    <p>Still, the mag­ni­tude of the losses was not as bad as in the 2008 great fi­nan­cial cri­sis, when the STI plunged 62 per cent from peak to trough, noted Dai­lyFX strate­gist Ms Mar­garet Yang.</p>
    <p>The worst pan­demic-hit com­po­nent stocks were Sin­ga­pore Air­lines and Jar­dine Cy­cle & Car­riage, each los­ing over 33 per cent, while Sing­tel shed 32 per cent and Com­fortDelGro and City De­vel­op­ments each fell about 29 per cent.</p>
    <p>At the other end of the spec­trum, the top per­former was Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries, with a 47 per cent gain af­ter its de­merger from Sem­b­corp Marine.</p>
    <p>Other win­ners in­cluded Ven­ture Corp, up 18 per cent; Wil­mar In­ter­na­tional, ahead 11 per cent; Kep­pel DC Reit, with a 35 per cent gain; and Maple­tree Lo­gis­tics Trust, which added 16 per cent.</p>
    <p>In­creased vac­cine op­ti­mism helped hos­pi­tal­ity- and avi­a­tion-re­lated stocks such as Far East Hos­pi­tal­ity Trust and Sats out­per­form ear­lier “lock­down win­ners” like su­per­mar­ket chain Sheng Siong, an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 re­cov­ery plays in­clud­ing SIA, Sats, Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore, As­cott Res­i­dence Trust, CDL Hos­pi­tal­ity Trusts and Far East Hos­pi­tal­ity Trust are worth con­sid­er­ing in the light of the vac­cine roll-out and Sin­ga­pore en­ter­ing phase three of its re­open­ing, UOB KayHian an­a­lyst Adrian Loh noted.</p>
    <p>He pointed to Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore’s un­ex­pect­edly strong thirdquar­ter re­sults, which had been un­der­pinned by lo­cal pa­tron­age.</p>
    <p>The grad­ual re­open­ing of Sin­ga­pore’s bor­ders should bode well for upcoming re­sults as main­land Chi­nese, Malaysians and In­done­sians ac­count for a sig­nif­i­cant chunk of its high-roller and mass mar­ket gross gam­ing rev­enue.</p>
    <p>There was a sharp di­ver­gence in per­for­mance across re­gional mar­kets, with the strong­est per­form­ers be­ing main­land China, South Korea, Tai­wan and Ja­pan, while Hong Kong and South-east Asian bourses lagged.</p>
    <p>Shang­hai was up nearly 13 per cent and Shen­zhen was 34 per cent ahead for the year. South Korea jumped nearly 31 per cent, while Tai­wan posted a 23 per cent gain and Ja­pan a 16 per cent rise.</p>
    <p>Thai­land shed around 8 per cent, Jakarta lost 5 per cent and Hong Kong fell about 3 per cent.</p>
    <p>“Asian eq­ui­ties are trad­ing at 30 per cent dis­count ver­sus de­vel­oped mar­ket eq­ui­ties, and fu­ture earn­ings growth are ex­pected to be in the high teens,” said Mr Ron­ald Chan, chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer, eq­ui­ties, Asia (ex-Ja­pan), Man­ulife In­vest­ment Man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>“This is be­cause Asia is still ben­e­fit­ing from ex­ter­nal de­mand, par­tic­u­larly when growth in de­vel­oped mar­kets is be­ing propped up by fis­cal pol­icy.</p>
    <p>“In ad­di­tion, it is ex­pected that half of Asia’s pop­u­la­tion will have been vac­ci­nated by the se­cond half of 2021, which means bor­ders will re­open and growth within Asia will re­sume.”</p>
