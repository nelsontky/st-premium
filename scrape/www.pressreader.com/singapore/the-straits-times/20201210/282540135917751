    <p>Sarkasi Said perks up when he sees the batik top this re­porter is wear­ing. He im­me­di­ately asks about the de­signer and the fab­ric. Batik, it is ev­i­dent, is his life’s pas­sion.</p>
    <p>The 80-year-old is best known for his batik de­signs on clothes. His or­chid-in­spired Sin­ga­pore Dress in the 1970s brought him fame and his bou­tique Tzee Cre­ations sold his de­signs. He says proudly: “Un­til to­day, the Prime Min­is­ter and the Pres­i­dent still or­der from me.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides his fash­ion cre­ations, Sarkasi has bro­ken new ground for a tech­nique bet­ter known as a tra­di­tional craft than as a way of cre­at­ing con­tem­po­rary art.</p>
    <p>He has used batik tech­niques with dif­fer­ent me­dia, such as wa­ter­colours, and cre­ated huge ab­stract can­vases which utilise batik mo­tifs in sub­tle ways.</p>
    <p>He speaks pas­sion­ately about dis­cern­ing be­tween batik craft and batik art, and dif­fer­en­ti­at­ing be­tween the tech­nique and the prod­uct which many as­so­ciate with touristy shirts and ac­ces­sories.</p>
    <p>The self-taught artist is chuffed to be awarded the Cul­tural Medal­lion. “It’s a great com­pli­ment, the best of my life as an artist.”</p>
    <p>It is a long way from his mod­est be­gin­nings, help­ing his grand­mother sell batik for ex­tra in­come and hawk­ing art on the street.</p>
    <p>He re­calls a care­free child­hood, sur­rounded by na­ture in the kam­pung where he grew up swim­ming in a pond fed by fresh­wa­ter streams.</p>
    <p>He is grate­ful for the chance to ded­i­cate his life to art. “I have been quite lucky. Sin­ga­pore has given me a lot of op­por­tu­ni­ties as an artist.”</p>
    <p>He also ac­knowl­edges the sup­port of his wife, Madam Salamah Ah­mad: “I was lucky she was un­der­stand­ing. She said, ‘You do what you need to do, we will find a way.’ She made nasi lemak, kuih, epok epok, and my chil­dren sold them af­ter school. She used that money to buy wash­ing ma­chine, re­frig­er­a­tor.”</p>
    <p>He has four chil­dren and his son, Ika Zahri, 53, is a well-known batik artist as well.</p>
    <p>Sarkasi made do with what he could find in or­der to make art. He re­calls beach­comb­ing for twigs to make into char­coal for sketch­ing; res­cu­ing dis­carded paint from garbage cans at Ba­harud­din Vo­ca­tional In­sti­tute, where he taught; and get­ting tex­tile paint do­na­tions from an interior de­signer friend.</p>
    <p>De­spite a hard­scrab­ble life, he re­coils from the idea of mak­ing money from his art.</p>
    <p>He has given free work­shops at kinder­gartens and vol­un­teered as an art teacher at a drug re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion cen­tre. “It’s not im­por­tant whether I’m go­ing to sell the works or not. It’s more im­por­tant to build aware­ness in the com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>Art is for per­sonal ex­pres­sion, tapping his in­ner self. “What I ex­pect to get when I paint is my feel­ings. Whether it’s ac­cepted by many is not i mpor­tant. What’s im­por­tant is try­ing some­thing.”</p>
    <p>He is still try­ing new things. His lat­est work in­volves throw­ing paint at fab­ric – a method which is very ex­pen­sive, he says wryly.</p>
    <p>Now that he can tap the Cul­tural Medal­lion fund for an $80,000 grant, he is hop­ing to or­gan­ise an ex­hi­bi­tion and get a book writ­ten about his work.</p>
    <p>The artist, who dropped out of Beatty Se­condary School at age 16 to pur­sue his art, says: “I am not that well ed­u­cated. But with a book, I can in­tro­duce my­self, the be­gin­ning of batik, ex­plain how I get to do what I do now.”</p>
    <p>He points out that while the tra­di­tional method of us­ing hot wax to cre­ate pat­terns has not changed, artists can ex­per­i­ment with us­ing al­ter­na­tive tech­niques such as cold wax or drip­ping wax on hot fab­ric to cre­ate dif­fer­ent ef­fects. He sees many pos­si­bil­i­ties in batik tech­niques for cre­at­ing work.</p>
    <p>Although his health presents some chal­lenges, he is still con­stantly think­ing about his work.</p>
    <p>The eter­nal optimist says, chuck­ling: “I look at the brighter side. I don’t see dark­ness in the tun­nel, I see light. The light is within me.”</p>
    <p>That sunny outlook and his pas­sion for batik keep him go­ing. “Art is a life that has got no full stop.”</p>
