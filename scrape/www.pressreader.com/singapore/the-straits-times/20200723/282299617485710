    <p>LON­DON • As­ton Villa man­ager Dean Smith praised his side’s “courage and heart” after they moved out of the Premier League rel­e­ga­tion zone with a vi­tal 1-0 win over Arse­nal on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The home side were given a boost when Wat­ford were thrashed 4-0 by Manch­ester City ear­lier, but still needed to beat Arse­nal to take ad­van­tage and move above Wat­ford and out of the bot­tom three by virtue of goal dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Egyp­tian winger Trezeguet’s first-half goal proved enough and Villa will visit West Ham on the fi­nal day of the sea­son know­ing vic­tory will keep them up as long as</p>
    <p>Wat­ford do not win at Arse­nal by a larger mar­gin.</p>
    <p>As it stands, Villa are 17th on 34 points, ahead of Wat­ford by a goal dif­fer­ence of one.</p>
    <p>It may be a tor­tu­ous Sun­day for Smith and his team but hav­ing been in the bot­tom three since Fe­bru­ary, they now have a golden chance to seal a sec­ond suc­ces­sive top-flight sea­son.</p>
    <p>“It was a great per­for­mance but an even bet­ter re­sult. We knew we had to show a lot of courage, heart and work rate and we did that. I can’t re­mem­ber our goal­keeper mak­ing saves,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It’s a big boost, that’s for sure. We knew we had to win to catch Wat­ford. Now we’ve got the sea­son in our own hands. Wat­ford can go and win at Arse­nal so we have to make sure we win at West Ham.”</p>
    <p>Villa have strug­gled to hold on to leads this sea­son, drop­ping 21 points from win­ning po­si­tions, while Arse­nal had earned 18 points from los­ing po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>So there was real ten­sion in the air at Villa Park, although the hosts de­fended with calm au­thor­ity to limit Arse­nal’s at­tack – they had seven shots but none on tar­get – and clinch a first home league win over the Gun­ners in 18 at­tempts dat­ing back to 1998.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been much bet­ter de­fen­sively over th­ese eight games (since the restart),” Smith added.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to be bet­ter and the play­ers were en­gaged with the video ses­sions we did.</p>
    <p>“It was a real team per­for­mance to­day. We de­fended the box very well, I don’t re­mem­ber (goal­keeper) Pepe Reina mak­ing a save.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing se­cured a place in the FA Cup fi­nal by beat­ing City 2-0 last Satur­day, Gun­ners coach Mikel Arteta made six changes and Arse­nal looked a shadow of the team who im­pressed at Wem­b­ley.</p>
    <p>“Emo­tion­ally and phys­i­cally, it’s been a very de­mand­ing week but I saw a team who wanted to fight un­til the end,” Arteta in­sisted.</p>
    <p>“We were in some re­ally good po­si­tions but we didn’t man­age to de­liver the ball.”</p>
    <p>Arse­nal can­not fin­ish higher than eighth and must win the FA Cup fi­nal against Chelsea to qual­ify for next sea­son’s Europa League.</p>
    <p>For all the pos­i­tive signs since Arteta took charge in December, Arse­nal will suf­fer their low­est league fin­ish since 1995.</p>
    <p>“It tells you the gap doesn’t lie. We have to make that smaller and smaller,” the Spa­niard said.</p>
    <p>“I know where we are in cer­tain ar­eas and where we need to im­prove. We will get there.”</p>
    <p>IN OUR OWN HANDS</p>
    <p>We knew we had to win to catch Wat­ford. Now we’ve got the sea­son in our own hands. Wat­ford can go and win at Arse­nal so we have to make sure we win at West Ham. ’’</p>
