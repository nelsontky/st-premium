    <p>ANTISANA VOL­CANO (Ecuador) • On a rocky out­crop in an Ecuado­ran na­ture re­serve, a pair of pro­lific An­dean con­dors are giv­ing con­ser­va­tion­ists a glim­mer of hope that the species, un­der threat from poi­son­ing and hunt­ing, could yet sur­vive and thrive.</p>
    <p>The mas­sive An­dean con­dor (Vul­tur gry­phus), which calls the South Amer­i­can moun­tain range home, has a 3.5m wing­span, mak­ing it one of the largest fly­ing birds.</p>
    <p>“This cou­ple of con­dors is the most im­pres­sive and most pro­lific pair we know of for this species,” says bi­ol­o­gist Se­bas­tian Kohn, di­rec­tor of the An­dean Con­dors Foun­da­tion, which works closely with Ecuador’s En­vi­ron­ment Min­istry.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers have been ob­serv­ing the pair in the Chakana pri­vate na­ture re­serve, set on the slopes of the Antisana Vol­cano, for the past seven years.</p>
    <p>“Since 2013, when we first started study­ing them, they have al­ready had seven chicks,” said Dr Kohn, whose team ob­serves the birds with binoc­u­lars from a watch­tower in the re­serve, 50km south­east of the cap­i­tal Quito.</p>
    <p>These long-lived monog­a­mous birds usu­ally re­pro­duce slowly, a mat­ing pair usu­ally only pro­duc­ing a chick ev­ery two or three years.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers say the likely rea­son for this pair’s high re­pro­duc­tion rate is good ac­cess to food, es­pe­cially car­rion, and the feel­ing of se­cu­rity pro­vided by be­ing in the re­serve.</p>
    <p>But bi­ol­o­gists are still con­cerned about the fu­ture of the species in Ecuador, and in­deed through­out the moun­tain range.</p>
    <p>Dr Kohn said Ecuador – where 150 in­di­vid­ual birds were iden­ti­fied for a 2018 cen­sus – should raise its “crit­i­cal alert level” for the species.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, there are some 6,700 con­dors, but num­bers are de­clin­ing. The In­ter­na­tional Union for the Con­ser­va­tion of Na­ture clas­si­fies the con­dor as “near threat­ened” on its watch list.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, on an­other rocky out­crop in the re­serve, at about 4,100m above sea level, is the main perch where about 40 of the birds have been spot­ted.</p>
    <p>Dr Kohn said that over the last two years, “we have lost 15 to 20 in­di­vid­u­als, mainly due to poi­son­ing” linked to the con­sump­tion of con­tam­i­nated car­rion meant for live­stock preda­tors, in ad­di­tion to hunt­ing.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, one of the birds, which re­searchers had named Iguinaro, was found dead.</p>
    <p>It had been re­leased into the Chakana re­serve only in May, af­ter be­ing treated for gun­shot wounds.</p>
