    <p>Ma­rina Bay Sands (MBS) has ap­pointed a top law firm to in­ves­ti­gate whether its em­ploy­ees were right in trans­fer­ring more than US$1 bil­lion (S$1.4 bil­lion) of gam­blers’ money to third par­ties, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter. Con­cerns about money laun­der­ing have been raised.</p>
    <p>The re­view by Davin­der Singh Cham­bers comes af­ter a pa­tron sued MBS last year, al­leg­ing that $9.1 mil­lion of his money was trans­ferred to other gam­blers with­out his knowledge. It adds to the scru­tiny of the firm by the United States Depart­ment of Jus­tice and Sin­ga­pore au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Once the client sued MBS, sev­eral au­thor­i­ties started look­ing at how MBS han­dled and mon­i­tored third­party trans­fers. Such trans­ac­tions are le­gal when au­tho­rised. Groups of wealthy gam­blers in Asia use them to pool win­nings and losses at dif­fer­ent casi­nos.</p>
    <p>The trans­fers are some­times made through so-called jun­ket op­er­a­tors, which pro­vide trans­porta­tion, ho­tels and credit to high rollers. In Ma­cau, the jun­kets al­low Chi­nese gam­blers to get around strict cap­i­tal con­trols by pledg­ing as­sets on the main­land in ex­change for credit at casi­nos.</p>
    <p>But jun­kets and trans­fers can have pit­falls too. An ear­lier probe by MBS and the Ho­gan Lovells law firm found in­stances in which em­ploy­ees had pre-signed or pho­to­copied au­tho­ri­sa­tion forms, ac­cord­ing to the peo­ple. It also un­cov­ered cases in which orig­i­nal doc­u­ments were de­stroyed, the peo­ple said.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the Ho­gan Lovells re­view cov­er­ing the pe­riod from 2013 to 2017, more than 3,000 let­ters of au­tho­ri­sa­tion were used to en­dorse trans­fers of funds from pa­trons to third par­ties worth about $1.4 bil­lion, ac­cord­ing to the peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Of the trans­ac­tions scru­ti­nised in the Ho­gan Lovells re­view, let­ters au­tho­ris­ing trans­fers worth $365 mil­lion from mul­ti­ple pa­trons bore sig­na­tures that ap­peared to be sim­i­lar, fa­cil­i­tat­ing nu­mer­ous trans­fers, one of the peo­ple said.</p>
    <p>MBS, Las Ve­gas Sands’ Sin­ga­pore unit, is among the most prof­itable in bil­lion­aire Shel­don Adel­son’s gam­ing em­pire. It called on Ho­gan Lovells’ team that spe­cialises in cor­po­rate in­ves­ti­ga­tions and con­tentious reg­u­la­tory mat­ters af­ter Sin­ga­pore’s Casino Reg­u­la­tory Author­ity (CRA) started its probe fol­low­ing the 2019 suit by pa­tron Wang Xi.</p>
    <p>The law­suit was set­tled out of court in June this year, with the casino agree­ing to re­im­burse the full amount. There was a “non-ad­mis­sion” of li­a­bil­ity from both sides.</p>
    <p>The US At­tor­ney’s Of­fice, mean­while, in­ter­viewed a for­mer com­pli­ance chief of MBS in July as part of the Jus­tice Depart­ment’s probe into whether anti-money laun­der­ing pro­ce­dures had been breached in han­dling high rollers, peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said.</p>
    <p>Davin­der Singh Cham­bers, which spe­cialises in dis­pute res­o­lu­tion and in­ter­na­tional ar­bi­tra­tion, was ap­pointed af­ter Sin­ga­pore po­lice be­gan a probe of third-party trans­fers.</p>
    <p>MBS said in a state­ment that when is­sues re­gard­ing the han­dling of client trans­fers were raised, the com­pany thor­oughly re­viewed the mat­ter and con­cluded that no pa­tron funds were trans­ferred in a man­ner that was con­trary to the client’s in­tent. “MBS con­tin­ues to work closely with its reg­u­la­tors to mon­i­tor MBS’ com­pli­ance with all le­gal obli­ga­tions,” the casino said.</p>
    <p>Las Ve­gas Sands dropped 4.2 per cent in New York on Wed­nes­day, af­ter ear­lier plung­ing as much as 8.9 per cent, the most since March. The shares were down 25 per cent this year as at Tues­day’s close.</p>
    <p>A rep­re­sen­ta­tive for Davin­der Singh Cham­bers de­clined to com­ment. The Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force said it is in­ap­pro­pri­ate to com­ment as in­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to me­dia queries, the CRA said it has com­pleted in­ves­ti­ga­tions into al­le­ga­tions that MBS car­ried out unau­tho­rised trans­fers from a pa­tron’s ac­count. While it con­cluded the casino did not breach re­quire­ments in that case, “there were weak­nesses in MBS’ casino con­trol mea­sures per­tain­ing to fund trans­fers”, CRA said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The reg­u­la­tor “takes a se­ri­ous view of such mat­ters and had di­rected MBS to strengthen its con­trol mea­sures, which MBS has since un­der­taken”, it said.</p>
    <p>“CRA will con­tinue to ex­er­cise close over­sight to en­sure that MBS’ mea­sures are ef­fec­tive.”</p>
