    <p>Thought­ful gov­ern­ments need to ad­dress cer­tain key is­sues be­fore rolling back re­lief mea­sures that were in­tro­duced to help com­pa­nies and in­di­vid­u­als cope with the eco­nomic fall­out of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Job cre­ation, the shape of the econ­omy and sus­tain­abil­ity need all be care­fully con­sid­ered be­fore eas­ing off fi­nan­cial sup­port.</p>
    <p>Most coun­tries have to de­vise an exit plan to pre­vent com­pa­nies and in­di­vid­u­als from re­ly­ing too much on govern­ment aid dur­ing the pan­demic, said DBS Bank chief ex­ec­u­tive Piyush Gupta yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>So far, gov­ern­ments have given money to the un­em­ployed, to fam­i­lies and to firms to save jobs, Mr Gupta said at a vir­tual brief­ing ahead of the DBS Asian In­sights Con­fer­ence later this week. How­ever, “most of this money spent... kicks the can down the road”.</p>
    <p>He added that such ap­proaches have a short shelf life be­cause “gov­ern­ments don’t have in­fi­nite money” and that they cre­ate moral haz­ards be­cause “people just get ac­cus­tomed to the idea of get­ting con­stant bailout”.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments have to exit from this fi­nan­cial logic and re­alise that they can­not be a “fi­nal set of re­course to ev­ery­body”.</p>
    <p>The United States, for ex­am­ple, is de­bat­ing whether to con­tinue hand­ing out US$600 (S$834) a week to the un­em­ployed, given that some law­mak­ers see the pay­ments as in­hibit­ing eco­nomic re­cov­ery by dis­in­cen­tivis­ing residents to work.</p>
    <p>The Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Singapore has started talk­ing to banks about help­ing debtors who had taken up re­lief mea­sures with a soft land­ing when the mea­sures are rolled back by the end of this year.</p>
    <p>At the height of the cri­sis, the cen­tral bank had thrown such cash­squeezed firms and in­di­vid­u­als a life­line by al­low­ing them to de­fer re­pay­ments, among other mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Mr Gupta said: “The re­al­ity is that most coun­tries are go­ing to (come up with a soft land­ing)... The exit from the set of mea­sures can­not be cold tur­key.”</p>
    <p>The exit plan, which will have to be cal­i­brated and tai­lored, must aim at in­vest­ment and not con­sump­tion, he added.</p>
    <p>The chal­lenge for gov­ern­ments is to de­cide where to con­tinue greas­ing the wheels, Mr Gupta added.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 cre­ates a tremen­dous op­por­tu­nity to es­tab­lish a re­set... to start re­think­ing about the role of the pri­vate sec­tor and what we can do to make a dif­fer­ence.”</p>
    <p>But he added that all hands must be on deck to sup­port the change.</p>
    <p>“If (gov­ern­ments) are thought­ful, (they) will think about is­sues like job cre­ation, about the future shape of (their) econ­omy and sus­tain­abil­ity,” Mr Gupta said.</p>
    <p>“If we can get this right, then we can recog­nise that the en­vi­ron­men­tal, social and gov­er­nance agenda... will be­come front and cen­tre of the new de­vel­op­ment par­a­digm.”</p>
    <p>Mr Gupta pointed out that the eco­nomic fall­out from Covid-19 sig­nals not just a cycli­cal cri­sis, but a mas­sive slow­down and re­struc­tur­ing that could in­tro­duce new ways of work and life, the way the Great De­pres­sion in the 1930s led to the cre­ation of an im­mense social se­cu­rity net­work and un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits in the US.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments should de­cide now how to build back better. But the go­ing will be tough, he said.</p>
    <p>“Mak­ing choices is al­ways a poi­soned chal­ice for any govern­ment and for any lead­er­ship. It is not easy to do, but nev­er­the­less, it is an op­por­tu­nity and in many cases, I think lead­er­ship will come through and make those kind of choices in a sen­si­ble way,” Mr Gupta said.</p>
    <p>United Na­tions De­vel­op­ment Pro­gramme ad­min­is­tra­tor Achim Steiner, the other pan­el­list at the con­fer­ence, said that the jury is still out on whether 2020 will be a year of disaster or op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>He added that there is “very limited room for con­ceiv­ing the future in a dif­fer­ent way (given that) the pan­demic is get­ting worse”.</p>
    <p>“The next six to 12 months will be highly stress­ful, un­cer­tain and bear enor­mous risk,” he said.</p>
    <p>“One of the things that clearly will deter­mine (the path ahead) is where lead­er­ship is go­ing to come from.”</p>
