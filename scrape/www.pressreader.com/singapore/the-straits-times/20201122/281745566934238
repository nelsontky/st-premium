    <p>When em­ploy­ees at pro­fes­sional ser­vices com­pany Ac­cen­ture need to talk about their work stress, they know they can count on col­leagues who are equipped to help.</p>
    <p>The firm has 186 trained men­tal health al­lies across the re­gion, in­clud­ing 159 in Sin­ga­pore. Since the Covid-19 pan­demic started, this group has in­creased its fre­quency of train­ing ses­sions vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>Ms Grace Yip, Ac­cen­ture’s head of hu­man re­sources for South-east Asia, said: “While they are not trained coun­sel­lors or ther­a­pists, they can speak to our peo­ple con­fi­den­tially, and point them to pro­fes­sional sup­port.”</p>
    <p>This ini­tia­tive, started two years ago, is part of larger ef­forts to cre­ate aware­ness about men­tal health and pro­mote in­clu­sion within the firm.</p>
    <p>The com­pany also in­cor­po­rated men­tal health cov­er­age into em­ployee health ben­e­fits in 2018, which al­lowed claims for re­lated treat­ments to be made un­der its spe­cial­ist out­pa­tient in­surance if em­ploy­ees had a re­fer­ral let­ter from their physi­cians. Last year, it re­moved the need for re­fer­rals.</p>
    <p>Touch­ing on the blurred lines be­tween pro­fes­sional and per­sonal com­mit­ments in the past few months, Ms Yip said this presents an op­por­tu­nity to show what re­spon­si­ble lead­er­ship is.</p>
    <p>Of­fer­ing open com­mu­ni­ca­tion chan­nels for work­ers to voice their con­cerns “with­out the fear of lost op­por­tu­ni­ties or judg­ment” is cru­cial, she noted.</p>
    <p>The ef­forts have paid off, said Ms Yip, point­ing to in­ter­nal sur­veys that have shown an in­crease in the pro­por­tion of staff who feel safe talk­ing about men­tal health chal­lenges with their su­per­vi­sors.</p>
    <p>“When an or­gan­i­sa­tion looks af­ter its em­ploy­ees, it will re­flect pos­i­tively in its busi­ness. Hence, it is not just a good in­vest­ment, it is a nec­es­sary in­vest­ment,” she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Gigi Su, a se­nior man­ager at Ac­cen­ture, be­lieves that the var­i­ous work­place poli­cies have al­lowed her to be pro­duc­tive at work, while pro­tect­ing her per­sonal time with her 40-year-old hus­band and five-year-old son.</p>
    <p>The 37-year-old, who tog­gles be­tween work­ing from home and the of­fice, said work­ers are not ex­pected to re­spond to work e-mails im­me­di­ately or over week­ends.</p>
    <p>“I do not feel pro­hib­ited from hav­ing to seek per­sonal time off or de­clin­ing meet­ings that do not align with my sched­ule,” she added. “More im­por­tantly, I al­ways have col­leagues and lead­ers who re­mind me when and how to take a break.” Calvin Yang</p>
    <p>A NEC­ES­SARY IN­VEST­MENT</p>
    <p>When an or­gan­i­sa­tion looks af­ter its em­ploy­ees, it will re­flect pos­i­tively in its busi­ness. Hence, it is not just a good in­vest­ment, it is a nec­es­sary in­vest­ment. ’’</p>
