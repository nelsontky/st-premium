    <p>ZURICH Roger Fed­erer is prac­tis­ing pain-free af­ter un­der­go­ing two knee surg­eries this year and says he ex­pects to re­turn to the cir­cuit at the Aus­tralian Open in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>The 39-year-old Swiss reached the semi-fi­nals at Melbourne Park at the start of the year but has not played since a sec­ond arthro­scopic pro­ce­dure on his right knee.</p>
    <p>“I’m on the right track,” the 20-time Grand Slam cham­pion told Swiss magazine Sch­weizer Il­lus­tri­erte.</p>
    <p>“I’m grad­u­ally com­ing back, but I’m go­ing to take my time and don’t want to put any pres­sure on my­self.</p>
    <p>“I will only take part in a tour­na­ment when I am 100 per cent fit.</p>
    <p>“At the mo­ment, it looks like I can make my come­back at the Aus­tralian Open in Jan­uary.”</p>
    <p>While Fed­erer, who in June de­clared that his sea­son was over, has made sig­nif­i­cant progress in his re­cov­ery, he is still not at the point where he can train nor­mally.</p>
    <p>“Not yet, more than two hours with the racket are not pos­si­ble at the mo­ment,” said the world No. 4, who saw sec­ond-ranked Rafael Nadal equal his Slam haul with a 13th French Open ti­tle ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>“But I’ve been work­ing on my stamina and strength ab­so­lutely with­out pain for a while. There will be no fur­ther op­er­a­tions.”</p>
    <p>Fed­erer has of­ten been asked about his re­tire­ment plans but the</p>
    <p>Swiss said he would keep play­ing as long as he was en­joy­ing it.</p>
    <p>“I have been think­ing about ideas for about five years,” he added. “But as long as I am hav­ing fun and it’s right for all of us, I’ll keep go­ing.</p>
    <p>“I will fo­cus on my fam­ily, my foun­da­tion and my spon­sors. I am very in­ter­ested in busi­ness ideas and en­trepreneur­ship. But I def­i­nitely don’t want to plan ev­ery­thing now.</p>
    <p>“I want to go back to many places where I’ve been. I like to travel to Asia and South Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>“I liked Mex­ico, Chile and Colom­bia too. I can imag­ine tak­ing part in ex­hi­bi­tion matches, tak­ing ten­nis to places where this sport is still lit­tle no­ticed.”</p>
