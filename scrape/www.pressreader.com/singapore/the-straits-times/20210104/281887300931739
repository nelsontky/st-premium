    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO • Nine peo­ple – in­clud­ing seven who were de­scribed by the au­thor­i­ties as ju­ve­niles – were killed in a fiery head-on crash be­tween a sport util­ity ve­hi­cle (SUV) and a pickup i n Fresno County on Fri­day, the Cal­i­for­nia High­way Pa­trol said.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have not re­leased the names of the vic­tims, and the High­way Pa­trol said it was work­ing with the Fresno County Coroner’s Of­fice to de­ter­mine whether al­co­hol or drugs might have played a role in the crash.</p>
    <p>The col­li­sion hap­pened at about 8pm lo­cal time on State Route 33, near the Fresno County-Kings County line, when the SUV driven by a 28-year-old man from Ave­nal, Cal­i­for­nia, was trav­el­ling south­bound at an un­known speed, the High­way Pa­trol said.</p>
    <p>As the driver ap­proached a pickup car­ry­ing eight peo­ple that was trav­el­ling in the op­po­site di­rec­tion, he veered onto the dirt shoul­der, lost con­trol of the ve­hi­cle and trav­elled back across the cen­tre line, slam­ming head-on into the pickup.</p>
    <p>The pickup “be­came fully en­gulfed in flames”, and all eight oc­cu­pants were killed, in­clud­ing seven peo­ple who “ap­peared to be ju­ve­niles”, Cap­tain Kevin Clays of the High­way Pa­trol told a news con­fer­ence. The driver of the SUV was also killed.</p>
    <p>It was not im­me­di­ately clear if the seven young vic­tims were chil­dren or teenagers. Capt Clays said the au­thor­i­ties were work­ing to de­ter­mine the vic­tims’ ages.</p>
    <p>The pickup was equipped with only six seat belts, he said.</p>
    <p>He noted that when peo­ple are not buck­led up, the chances that they will suf­fer se­ri­ous in­juries in a crash are “far greater”.</p>
    <p>He said the of­fi­cers who re­sponded to the col­li­sion had been of­fered coun­selling. “It’s tragic for the com­mu­nity,” he said. “It’s tragic for our of­fi­cers that re­spond to these in­ci­dents.”</p>
