    <p>SEOUL • South Korea recorded its 16th con­sec­u­tive day of triple-digit rises in new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, ex­tend­ing a se­cond wave of in­fec­tions that is fan­ning con­cerns about a short­age of hos­pi­tal beds in Seoul.</p>
    <p>The Korea Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion (KCDC) posted 308 new cases as of mid­night on Friday, the ma­jor­ity of them in the cap­i­tal and sur­round­ing ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Out­breaks have con­tin­ued to erupt at churches, of­fices, nurs­ing homes and med­i­cal fa­cil­i­ties, even af­ter of­fi­cials tight­ened so­cial-dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
    <p>The spike in cases has de­pleted hos­pi­tal fa­cil­i­ties, with the health min­istry re­port­ing that just 4.5 per cent of beds in greater Seoul were avail­able for crit­i­cal cases as of Friday, down from 22 per cent a week ear­lier.</p>
    <p>“Only about 15 beds are im­me­di­ately avail­able in the greater Seoul area for pa­tients in crit­i­cal con­di­tion as there were nu­mer­ous pa­tients who were in a se­ri­ous con­di­tion and needed to be hos­pi­talised,” Mr Yoon Tae-ho, di­rec­tor-gen­eral for pub­lic health pol­icy at the health min­istry, said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“But we should have a lit­tle more room shortly be­cause more peo­ple are be­ing re­leased,” he told a news brief­ing.</p>
    <p>The KCDC said more than 1,000 cases have been traced to the Sarang Jeil Church in Seoul, which is at the cen­tre of the new wave of in­fec­tions. Its head, Rev­erend Jun Kwang-hoon, is an out­spo­ken govern­ment critic who was also con­firmed to have con­tracted the virus.</p>
    <p>Deal­ing with the se­cond wave of in­fec­tions has been com­pli­cated by an on­go­ing strike of al­most 16,000 in­tern and res­i­dent doc­tors. The medics walked out on Aug 21, in a dis­pute over the govern­ment’s plans to boost the num­ber of doc­tors to bet­ter deal with health crises like the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The health min­istry last week filed a po­lice com­plaint against at least 10 doc­tors and ex­tended a back-to-work or­der for the doc­tors, who are the back­bone of health­care ser­vices in emer­gency rooms and in­ten­sive care units.</p>
    <p>The strik­ing doc­tors have vol­un­teered at tem­po­rary test­ing cen­tres to help with the out­break, but ma­jor hos­pi­tals have re­ported de­lays and dis­rup­tions since their walk­out.</p>
    <p>“Doc­tors should be by the side of pa­tients as we face the pos­si­bil­ity of a na­tion­wide trans­mis­sion of Covid-19,” Mr Yoon said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We are stand­ing on the last line of de­fence to calm the spread in the Seoul metropoli­tan area, and if we fail at it, the only op­tion we have left is to step up dis­tanc­ing rules to the high­est level.”</p>
    <p>The govern­ment took the un­prece­dented step on Friday of re­strict­ing the op­er­a­tion of eater­ies in the cap­i­tal area.</p>
    <p>For a week starting to­day, on­site din­ing at restau­rants, pubs and bak­eries in the Seoul area will be banned af­ter 9pm, while cof­fee shops, some of which have been iden­ti­fied as hot spots, are re­stricted to take­out and de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>Churches, night­clubs, gyms and most schools in the area are al­ready closed, and masks are manda­tory in pub­lic places.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, nearly 200 coro­n­avirus sur­vivors from the Shin­cheonji Church of Je­sus, a se­cre­tive South Korean sect blamed for the coun­try’s early out­break, do­nated blood plasma on Friday to help treat­ment re­search, as the group seeks to re­deem it­self.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists have pointed to the po­ten­tial for treat­ment us­ing blood plasma con­tain­ing an­ti­bod­ies to the virus from in­di­vid­u­als who have re­cov­ered from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>By far the South’s largest con­tin­gent of coro­n­avirus sur­vivors is from the Shin­cheonji, which is of­ten con­demned as a cult. It is linked to more than 5,000 virus cases in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Its el­derly leader Lee Man-hee was ar­rested ear­lier this month for al­legedly hin­der­ing the govern­ment’s ef­forts to con­tain the epi­demic.</p>
    <p>More than 1,000 Shin­cheonji mem­bers are do­nat­ing plasma over the course of a week.</p>
    <p>Shin­cheonji has apol­o­gised “for caus­ing much con­cern and worry to the peo­ple of Korea”, the sect said in a statement, adding that its leader Lee had en­cour­aged its mem­bers to do­nate.</p>
    <p>Driven by sev­eral clus­ters, many of the lat­est cases are linked to Protes­tant churches in the Seoul re­gion.</p>
    <p>Shin­cheonji was heav­ily vil­i­fied back in Fe­bru­ary, and more than 1.4 mil­lion peo­ple signed a pe­ti­tion on the South Korean pres­i­den­tial of­fice web­site de­mand­ing its dis­so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Deal­ing with the se­cond wave of in­fec­tions has been com­pli­cated by an on­go­ing strike of al­most 16,000 in­tern and res­i­dent doc­tors. The medics walked out on Aug 21, in a dis­pute over the govern­ment’s plans to boost the num­ber of doc­tors to bet­ter deal with health crises like the coro­n­avirus.</p>
