    <p>A semi-re­tired busi­ness­man, who fa­tally stabbed his son-in-law in front of a lunchtime crowd three years ago, was sen­tenced to 81/</p>
    <p>2 years’ jail yes­ter­day, in what a High Court judge de­scribed as a “tragic” case.</p>
    <p>Tan Nam Seng, 72, was un­happy with how the younger man had treated his daugh­ter and be­lieved that it was part of a ploy to cheat him of his busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Tan pleaded guilty last month to a re­duced charge of cul­pa­ble homi­cide for stab­bing Mr Spencer Tup­pani, 39, three times in the chest out­side a Telok Ayer Street cof­fee shop at about 1.20pm on July 10, 2017.</p>
    <p>Closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion footage played in court showed Mr Tup­pani run­ning away and col­laps­ing in front of a restau­rant in Boon Tat Street. Tan was seen in the footage kick­ing Mr Tup­pani twice in the face and chas­ing passers-by away.</p>
    <p>“This was a vi­cious and brazen killing car­ried out in broad day­light on an un­sus­pect­ing vic­tim hav­ing a meal in a cof­fee shop in the Cen­tral Busi­ness Dis­trict,” said Jus­tice Dedar Singh Gill in sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the judge noted that Tan was suf­fer­ing from ma­jor de­pres­sive dis­or­der at the time.</p>
    <p>Tan’s “fast-de­te­ri­o­rat­ing health” also weighed heav­ily on the judge’s mind, said Jus­tice Gill. In the three years he spent in cus­tody, Tan has con­tracted tu­ber­cu­lo­sis and had two heart at­tacks, among other med­i­cal is­sues.</p>
    <p>The jail term was back­dated to Tan’s date of ar­rest. With the usual one-third re­mis­sion, he is expected to be re­leased in about 21/ years’</p>
    <p>2 time.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, about 20 peo­ple in­clud­ing Tan’s daugh­ter and grand­chil­dren turned up in court for the sen­tenc­ing. Among them were sev­eral of his friends, who waved at him and gave him a thumbs-up as a sign of sup­port.</p>
    <p>On July 10, 2017, Tan was on his way to his of­fice at Ce­cil Court when he saw Mr Tup­pani in Telok Ayer Street. When he got to the of­fice, Tan went to the pantry to look for a knife and then headed to the cof­fee shop.</p>
    <p>He told Mr Tup­pani “you are too much” in Hokkien be­fore pulling the knife out of his sling bag and stab­bing the younger man.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Mr Tup­pani col­lapsed, Tan told passers-by: “This is my son-in­law, don’t help him, let him die.”</p>
    <p>Putting the knife on a ta­ble, he sat on a chair and waited for the po­lice to ar­rive. While waiting, Tan phoned his daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>“I can’t sleep at night. I have done it. I have killed him. Don’t cry. I am old al­ready. I am not scared (of) go­ing to jail,” he told her.</p>
    <p>Tan was orig­i­nally charged with mur­der, but the charge was re­duced af­ter a psy­chi­atric re­port found his de­pres­sion had impaired his men­tal re­spon­si­bil­ity for his ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Lim Jian Yi sought 12 years’ jail, call­ing the at­tack a case of “vig­i­lante jus­tice”, mo­ti­vated by re­venge, that re­sulted in a bru­tal and pub­lic killing.</p>
    <p>There is a need to de­ter oth­ers from tak­ing mat­ters into their own hands, he ar­gued.</p>
    <p>De­fence coun­sel Wee Pan Lee sought 71/ years’ jail, say­ing Tan</p>
    <p>2 had felt be­trayed by Mr Tup­pani, whom he had treated al­most like his own son.</p>
    <p>The lawyer said Mr Tup­pani’s mother and younger brother lived in the Tans’ fam­ily home.</p>
    <p>Mr Tup­pani hired his par­ents as em­ploy­ees, even though they were not in­volved in the busi­ness, and used com­pany funds to pay for his brother’s over­seas ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>In 2016, he per­suaded the Tans to sell the com­pany to GKE Cor­po­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Tan and his daugh­ter re­ceived only $450,000 each, in­stead of the $1 mil­lion and GKE shares they had expected, said Mr Wee.</p>
    <p>In 2017, Tan’s daugh­ter Shyller dis­cov­ered that Mr Tup­pani had bought a prop­erty and had a sec­ond fam­ily with an­other wo­man.</p>
    <p>Tan found out that Mr Tup­pani had been record­ing the cou­ple’s ar­gu­ments and be­lieved he in­tended to use them in di­vorce pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>Mr Tup­pani had also as­sured him that he would not claim for cus­tody of his three chil­dren with Shyller, but Tan later found out that his son-in-law had started cus­tody claims.</p>
    <p>“The con­stant re­as­sur­ances and prom­ises were lies and were all part of Spencer’s ploy to de­stroy his fam­ily, by tak­ing over the busi­ness and fight­ing for cus­tody over the grand­chil­dren,” said Mr Wee.</p>
    <p>PHONE CALL TO DAUGH­TER</p>
    <p>I can’t sleep at night. I have done it. I have killed him. Don’t cry. I am old al­ready. I am not scared (of) go­ing to jail.</p>
    <p>TAN NAM SENG, to his daugh­ter Shyller Tan on the phone, af­ter stab­bing her hus­band Spencer Tup­pani in the street.</p>
