    <p>When you want to start a stream­ing ser­vice and your most es­tab­lished com­peti­tor has for years been spend­ing bil­lions of dol­lars mak­ing and ac­quir­ing ex­clu­sive se­ries, what do you do?</p>
    <p>Dis­ney+ and Ap­ple TV+ chose to go halfway when they de­buted last year, ad­dress­ing Net­flix’s unas­sail­able lead with of­fer­ings of orig­i­nal shows that, in each case, amounted to more than a hand­ful but less than a ros­ter.</p>
    <p>This year, Pea­cock and HBO Max have gone for what could be called the Bri­tish op­tion.</p>
    <p>Be­hind each ser­vice’s first mar­quee se­ries – Love Life for HBO Max, Brave New World for Pea­cock – the sec­tion de­voted to orig­i­nals has been filled out with shows made and al­ready seen across the At­lantic.</p>
    <p>The Spe­cial Re­la­tion­ship may not have the geopo­lit­i­cal juice it once had, but it is alive and well in stream­ing video. Pea­cock, which made its debut in the United States last Wed­nes­day, opened with just three orig­i­nal scripted se­ries for adults, two of them Bri­tish.</p>
    <p>On the sur­face, the im­ports are quite dif­fer­ent from each other: The Cap­ture (2019 to present), from BBC, is an hour-long, tightly wound con­spir­acy thriller; while the work­place sit­com In­tel­li­gence (2020 to present), from Sky, is a 22-minute goof.</p>
    <p>But if you look past genre, they have some things in com­mon. Both are cau­tion­ary tales about the Bri­tish in­tel­li­gence ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The Cap­ture warns that the spies are steal­ing your lib­er­ties and will dis­ap­pear you if you protest. In­tel­li­gence warns that they are marginally com­pe­tent wackos more in­ter­ested in food de­liv­ery and pho­to­copier high jinks than in pre­vent­ing cy­ber ter­ror.</p>
    <p>More in­ter­est­ing, given their prom­i­nent place­ment on Pea­cock, is that both em­ploy a favourite Bri­tish tar­get: the ugly Amer­i­can. The short­com­ings of the Bri­tish char­ac­ters are fi­nessed by shift­ing at­ten­tion to an Amer­i­can in­ter­loper whose ma­lig­nancy is ex­ceeded only by his shal­low­ness.</p>
    <p>In The Cap­ture, he is a cool op­er­a­tive run­ning an off-the-books surveil­lance op­er­a­tion in Lon­don and pulling the strings of his peers in the Bri­tish spy and po­lice ser­vices. This would con­sti­tute a spoiler, as he does not show up right away in the en­gag­ingly con­vo­luted story, if Ron Perl­man’s name were not so prom­i­nent in the cred­its.</p>
    <p>In In­tel­li­gence, he is a Na­tional Se­cu­rity Agency li­ai­son to Bri­tain’s cy­ber-ter­ror­ism unit, and it prob­a­bly says all you need to know about the show’s view of Amer­i­cans that the ham­mer-headed, nar­cis­sis­tic char­ac­ter is played by David Sch­wim­mer, that avatar of ham­mer-headed Amer­i­can nar­cis­sism.</p>
    <p>In­tel­li­gence is mild tea over­all, but it is an easy binge at just over two hours for its six episodes.</p>
    <p>The Cap­ture, also a six-parter, is the bet­ter of the Pea­cock im­ports, a rea­son­ably en­ter­tain­ing and well­con­structed – at least in its early episodes – ex­am­ple of a clas­sic style of Bri­tish tele­vi­sion con­spir­acy thriller, most re­cently seen in Body­guard on BBC and Net­flix.</p>
    <p>Its hook is surveil­lance cul­ture, and it posits that Bri­tish law en­force­ment, with Amer­i­can help, is not only em­ploy­ing the kind of fa­cial-recog­ni­tion soft­ware pop­u­lar in China, but has also moved onto more ad­vanced and sin­is­ter uses of video technology.</p>
    <p>The se­ries, writ­ten and di­rected by Ben Chanan (The Miss­ing, 2014 to 2016), teases a l arger theme about sto­ry­telling – that gov­ern­ments can use technology to fic­tion­alise their cit­i­zens’ lives – but it mostly set­tles for be­ing a straight­for­ward thriller with the stylis­tic tic of of­ten pre­sent­ing the ac­tion through closed-cir­cuit cam­eras.</p>
    <p>The show holds up fairly well if you are the kind of con­spir­acy story fan who is sat­is­fied when each step pro­ceeds more or less plau­si­bly from the step be­fore. If you are the kind of fan who wants the over­all plot to feel as if it could ac­tu­ally take place in the real world, well, good luck.</p>
    <p>If there is a larger point to the in­clu­sion of The Cap­ture and In­tel­li­gence in Pea­cock’s ini­tial line-up, it may have to do with the smaller role that such “orig­i­nals” are play­ing while ser­vices pro­mote their li­braries of older se­ries and fran­chise movies to counter Net­flix’s fo­cus on the new.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish shows HBO Max launched with, like Ghosts and Home, have largely dis­ap­peared from the home page a few months later. And the tier for Pea­cock Orig­i­nals is sev­eral lev­els down, well below Juras­sic Park (1993 to 2001) and 30 Rock (2006 to 2013).</p>
    <p>If you want some­thing dif­fer­ent, you need to find it your­self.</p>
