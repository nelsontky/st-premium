    <p>In­done­sia, whose Covid-19 test­ing rate is the low­est among coun­tries with the high­est in­fec­tion num­bers, is still far from the peak of the coro­n­avirus out­break, ex­perts said, ar­gu­ing that the frac­tion of tests that come back pos­i­tive is still high.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia, whose Covid-19 test­ing rate is the low­est among coun­tries with the high­est in­fec­tion num­bers, is still far from the peak of the out­break, ex­perts said, ar­gu­ing that the frac­tion of tests com­ing back pos­i­tive is still high.</p>
    <p>With 8,287 tests for ev­ery mil­lion peo­ple, In­done­sia – the world’s fourth most pop­u­lous – is ranked the low­est among the coun­tries with 100,000 cases or above, based on pan­demic data site Worl­dome­ter. Bangladesh is the sec­ond worst with 9,563 tests for ev­ery mil­lion, and Mex­ico the third worst with 10,530.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia’s pos­i­tiv­ity rate, which mea­sures how many peo­ple who were tested turned out to have the virus, rose to between 11 per cent and 25 per cent last month, from between 7.7 per cent and 21 per cent in July .</p>
    <p>Dr Laura Nav­ila Ya­mani, an epi­demi­ol­o­gist with Air­langga Univer­sity, said a mea­sure above 5 per cent means the virus is still spread­ing fast and that the num­ber of in­fec­tions could rise.</p>
    <p>“In­done­sia’s curve may reach its peak and start to flat­ten only af­ter we boost test­ing and the pos­i­tiv­ity rate falls below 5 per cent and re­mains there con­sis­tently in all re­gions across the coun­try,” Dr Laura told The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She said In­done­sia’s bat­tle against the virus “should be sup­ported by mass tests, cou­pled with peo­ple who com­ply with health pro­to­cols”.</p>
    <p>Univer­sity of In­done­sia epi­demi­ol­o­gist Pandu Riono also doubted In­done­sia could see its epi­demic curve start­ing to flat­ten next month, say­ing it would be next year.</p>
    <p>The ex­perts’ re­marks were made af­ter Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo told a group of for­eign media on Tues­day the out­break would reach its peak this month be­fore flat­ten­ing next month, adding that the re­cent surge was due to in­creased test­ing.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia has ramped up its test­ing ca­pac­ity, but it is still below the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s (WHO) stan­dard, which is one test for ev­ery 1,000 peo­ple per week, Pro­fes­sor Wiku Adis­as­mito, a spokesman for the na­tional Covid-19 task force, said yes­ter­day. “For now the big­gest chal­lenge is car­ry­ing out test­ing mas­sively,” he said.</p>
    <p>With a pop­u­la­tion of 267 mil­lion, In­done­sia should raise test­ing ca­pac­ity to 267,000 per­sons per week. Cur­rently it has reached only 95,000 per week at the high­est point, Prof Wiku noted.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Joko said In­done­sia’s still-lag­ging test­ing rate is due to man­power con­straints, adding that it is try­ing to train more peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Dr Pandu sug­gested re­plac­ing the low-ca­pac­ity test­ing equip­ment with higher-ca­pac­ity, fully au­to­mated ones which re­quire fewer op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>Dr Laura also said In­done­sia has not done enough of con­tact trac­ing, cit­ing WHO’s rec­om­men­da­tion of do­ing tests on 30 pos­si­ble close con­tacts for ev­ery one per­son who tested pos­i­tive. In­done­sia’s av­er­age is fewer than five close con­tacts, she added.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia recorded 180,646 con­firmed cases, the sec­ond high­est in South-east Asia af­ter the Philip­pines, and 7,616 deaths, the high­est in the re­gion, as of yes­ter­day.</p>
