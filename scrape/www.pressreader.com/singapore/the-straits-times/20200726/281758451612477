    <p>Eleven more dor­mi­to­ries have been cleared of the coro­n­avirus, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) last night.</p>
    <p>The min­istry added that it is on track to clear all the dor­mi­to­ries by the be­gin­ning of next month, with the ex­cep­tion of 17 stand­alone blocks in eight pur­pose-built dor­mi­to­ries, which serve as quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties for 28,000 work­ers who are in iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The 11 newly cleared dor­mi­to­ries are in: 20 Kranji Road, Po­tong Pasir Av­enue 1, 63 Senoko Drive, 5 Sungei</p>
    <p>Kadut Av­enue, 59 Sungei Kadut Loop, 10 Tagore Drive, 212 Tagore Lane; 16 Tech Park Cres­cent, 23 Tech Park Cres­cent, 50 Tech Park Cres­cent and 29 Tuas View Walk.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, MOH said it de­tected 505 Covid-19 cases among mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries. This is out of the 513 to­tal new cases con­firmed as of yes­ter­day noon, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 49,888.</p>
    <p>Among the new pa­tients were two com­mu­nity cases, both of whom are work pass hold­ers.</p>
    <p>One of them was picked up as a re­sult of proac­tive sur­veil­lance and screen­ing of work­ers in es­sen­tial ser­vices liv­ing out­side dor­mi­to­ries, even though he is asymp­to­matic, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>Epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions are cur­rently in progress. All iden­ti­fied close con­tacts have been iso­lated and placed on quar­an­tine, and will be tested at the start of their quar­an­tine pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Sero­log­i­cal tests for his house­hold con­tacts will also be con­ducted to de­ter­mine if he could have been in­fected by them.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the other case was iden­ti­fied as a con­tact of a pre­vi­ously con­firmed case. He tested pos­i­tive dur­ing quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>MOH said the av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from nine cases two weeks ago to seven in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from a daily av­er­age of five cases to four over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>There were also six new im­ported cases who had been placed on stay­home no­tices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore and were tested while serv­ing the no­tice.</p>
    <p>They in­cluded two per­ma­nent res­i­dents who re­turned to Sin­ga­pore from In­dia on July 12, and from the United King­dom on July 10. The re­main­ing pa­tients are de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers who ar­rived from In­dia be­tween July 11 and July 13, in­clud­ing a three-year-old boy, an In­dian na­tional who had no symp­toms.</p>
    <p>A new clus­ter was also iden­ti­fied at a dor­mi­tory in 12 Defu Lane 7, com­pris­ing three of the newly con­firmed cases yes­ter­day and one pre­vi­ous case.</p>
    <p>Ra­mada Sin­ga­pore at Zhong­shan Park, a four-star ho­tel in Balestier, and B&S Mini Mart in Gey­lang were iden­ti­fied as pub­lic places vis­ited by coro­n­avirus pa­tients while they were still in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions and times that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited to get those who were there to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>MOH has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and that there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned, if needed.</p>
