    <p>WASHINGTON • The US na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser has warned China against any at­tempt to re­take Tai­wan by force, say­ing am­phibi­ous land­ings were no­to­ri­ously dif­fi­cult and there was a lot of am­bi­gu­ity about how t he United States would re­spond.</p>
    <p>Mr Robert O’Brien told an event at the Univer­sity of Ne­vada in Las Ve­gas on Wed­nes­day that China was en­gaged in a mas­sive naval buildup prob­a­bly not seen since Ger­many’s at­tempt to com­pete with Bri­tain’s Royal Navy prior to World War I.</p>
    <p>“Part of that is to give them the abil­ity to push us back out of the Western Pa­cific, and al­low them to en­gage in an am­phibi­ous land­ing in Tai­wan,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The prob­lem with that is that am­phibi­ous land­ings are no­to­ri­ously dif­fi­cult,” Mr O’Brien added, point­ing to the 160km dis­tance be­tween China and Tai­wan and the paucity of land­ing beaches on the is­land.</p>
    <p>“It’s not an easy task, and there’s also a lot of am­bi­gu­ity about what the United States would do in re­sponse to an at­tack by China on Tai­wan,” he added, when asked what the US op­tions would be if China moved to try to ab­sorb Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>Mr O’Brien was re­fer­ring to a US pol­icy of “strate­gic am­bi­gu­ity” on the ques­tion of whether it would in­ter­vene to pro­tect Tai­wan, which China con­sid­ers its prov­ince and has vowed to re­unite with the main­land, by force if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>The US is re­quired by law to pro­vide Tai­wan with the means to de­fend it­self, but it has not made clear whether it would in­ter­vene mil­i­tar­ily in the event of a Chi­nese at­tack, some­thing that would likely lead to a much broader con­flict with Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Mr O’Brien’s com­ments come at a time when China has sig­nif­i­cantly stepped up mil­i­tary ac­tiv­ity near Tai­wan and when Si­noAmer­i­can re­la­tions have plunged to their low­est point in decades in the run-up to Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s Nov 3 re-elec­tion bid.</p>
    <p>Mr O’Brien re­peated US calls for Tai­wan to spend more on its own de­fence and to carry out mil­i­tary re­forms to make clear to China the risks of at­tempt­ing to in­vade. “You can’t just spend 1 per cent of your GDP, which the Tai­wanese have been do­ing – 1.2 per cent – on de­fence, and hope to de­ter a China that’s been en­gaged in the most mas­sive mil­i­tary buildup in 70 years,” he said.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan needed to “turn them­selves into a por­cu­pine” mil­i­tar­ily, he said, adding: “Li­ons gen­er­ally don’t like to eat por­cu­pines.”</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Mr David Helvey, the act­ing US as­sis­tant sec­re­tary of de­fence for East Asia, called Tai­wan’s plan to boost de­fence spend­ing by US$1.4 bil­lion (S$1.9 bil­lion) next year in­suf­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>He said it needed to in­vest in ca­pa­bil­i­ties in­clud­ing more coastal de­fence cruise mis­siles, naval mines, fast-at­tack craft, mo­bile ar­tillery and ad­vanced sur­veil­lance as­sets.</p>
