    <p>The road to univer­sity can be dif­fi­cult for any stu­dent, but Mr Ng Jun Kang had to over­come daily chal­lenges that oth­ers man­aged eas­ily.</p>
    <p>Like get­ting to class, for in­stance, or tak­ing notes. Or even get­ting a drink of wa­ter.</p>
    <p>The 22-year-old com­puter science un­der­grad­u­ate at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) has spas­tic quad­ri­plegic cere­bral palsy, which was caused by a brain in­jury dur­ing birth.</p>
    <p>Although his con­di­tion af­fects his mus­cle con­trol, mo­tor skills and speech, it has proved no ob­sta­cle to his achiev­ing good grades and clinch­ing schol­ar­ships. Quite the op­po­site, he ar­gues.</p>
    <p>He said: “My con­di­tion has gifted me re­silience and pa­tience in ev­ery­thing that I do.”</p>
    <p>Even the act of drink­ing wa­ter has to be done con­sciously as his mus­cles may tense up, in­creas­ing the chance of him spilling the drink.</p>
    <p>The younger of two sons in his fam­ily, Mr Ng cred­its his suc­cess thus far to his fam­ily’s un­wa­ver­ing sup­port, in par­tic­u­lar his mother’s ded­i­ca­tion in his early years.</p>
    <p>“Grow­ing up, my mum helped me the most. When we had to get to places such as the hospi­tal and school, she some­times had to carry me on her back,” he said.</p>
    <p>“My mum also spent most of her time at home help­ing me with ther­apy so that I could get bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>While his father, Mr Ng Kim Tee, 54, went out to work as a plumber, his mother, Madam Leow Mui Lan, 56, cared for their son at home.</p>
    <p>To sup­ple­ment the fam­ily in­come, she would take on work fold­ing pa­per like in­voices, pa­per bags and boxes, and mak­ing cake bases.</p>
    <p>When he was about three years old, lit­tle Jun Kang suf­fered fits caused by high fever, and Madam Leow would rush him to a clinic on her bi­cy­cle be­fore he fell un­con­scious.</p>
    <p>“I lit­er­ally could not sleep in those days,” said Madam Leow, adding that she was de­ter­mined to teach her son to per­form tasks such as feed­ing him­self, so that he would be in­de­pen­dent.</p>
    <p>“Never give up and don’t be ashamed. Treat your child as nor­mally as pos­si­ble,” she said.</p>
    <p>Be­sides check-ups and ther­apy ses­sions, Mr Ng re­quired two an­kle foot or­thoses – sup­ports in­tended to con­trol the po­si­tion and mo­tion of his an­kles – and Bo­tox in­jec­tions to re­lease ten­sion in his legs.</p>
    <p>His med­i­cal and other bills took a toll on his fam­ily’s fi­nances.</p>
    <p>But, by the age of seven, he was able to tie his shoelaces, ride a twowheeled bi­cy­cle, use the bath­room and even go to school by him­self.</p>
    <p>Even so, main­stream school pre­sented nu­mer­ous ob­sta­cles. These in­cluded the chal­lenge of need­ing to take plenty of notes in classes such as his­tory and geography.</p>
    <p>He said: “As a re­sult, I chan­nelled my en­ergy into do­ing things that did not re­quire high writ­ing in­ten­sity, and things that I knew I could ex­cel in.”</p>
    <p>In all things, he dis­played a dogged de­ter­mi­na­tion to do his best.</p>
    <p>Af­ter his O lev­els, he pur­sued a di­ploma in elec­tronic and com­puter engi­neer­ing at Ngee Ann Polytech­nic. Some mod­ules there re­quired him to use both his hands to sol­der small elec­tronic parts, and it took rep­e­ti­tion and prac­tice to suc­cess­fully com­plete them.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng grad­u­ated with dis­tinc­tions in 16 mod­ules, earn­ing a near per­fect 3.9 grade point av­er­age.</p>
    <p>He was awarded the Xil­inx Asi­aPa­cific Prize for the best aca­demic per­for­mance in his spe­cial­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Asked why he pushed him­self so hard to do bet­ter than his peers, Mr Ng said: “I know that my dis­abil­ity dis­ad­van­tages me com­pared with other can­di­dates in the job mar­ket, so in­stinc­tively, it’s fight or flight.</p>
    <p>“I have to outdo them in or­der to com­pen­sate for my phys­i­cal short­com­ings. This moulded me into some­one who al­ways chooses to ex­cel in ev­ery­thing I do and not set­tle for less.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter en­list­ing in na­tional ser­vice (NS), he served as an in­tel­li­gence re­search spe­cial­ist in the Open Source Unit, ac­tively mon­i­tor­ing global cur­rent af­fairs – in­clud­ing se­cu­rity de­vel­op­ments and nat­u­ral dis­as­ters around the world.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng vol­un­tar­ily ex­tended his ser­vice by a month so he could pro­vide tech­ni­cal sup­port to the unit.</p>
    <p>While in NS, he also ap­plied his tech­ni­cal skills to three projects he worked on in his spare time: find­apet.to­day, a pet adop­tion web­site; whatinthe­world.xyz, an on­line re­source search en­gine; and Food Hitch Sin­ga­pore, a Tele­gram bot.</p>
    <p>Now in his first year at NUS, Mr Ng was this year awarded the Asia Pa­cific Brew­eries (APB) Foun­da­tion Schol­ar­ship for Per­sons with Dis­abil­i­ties – a wel­come relief to him and his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>He said: “The schol­ar­ship will be es­pe­cially help­ful dur­ing this pe­riod as my father had to stop work for around six months be­cause of Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>Spon­sored by APB Foun­da­tion and man­aged by lo­cal dis­abil­i­ty­fo­cused char­ity SPD, the schol­ar­ship recog­nises stu­dents with dis­abil­i­ties who have ex­celled in their stud­ies, demon­strated achieve­ments as a well-rounded in­di­vid­ual and made con­tri­bu­tions to the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said: “I would like to de­velop ap­pli­ca­tions that can help other peo­ple, es­pe­cially the com­mu­nity of peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties, as I know that we face more prob­lems than oth­ers in our daily lives.</p>
    <p>“My ad­vice to oth­ers with dis­abil­i­ties is to keep push­ing on. If you have a goal in mind, don’t give up. Even if you fail, get up and keep go­ing.”</p>
