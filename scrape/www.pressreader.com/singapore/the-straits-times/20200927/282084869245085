    <p>DOHA • Swedish pole vaulter Ar­mand Du­plan­tis com­pleted a per­fect sea­son when he beat world cham­pion Sam Ken­dricks at the Doha Di­a­mond League meet­ing on Friday, the last of a cam­paign short­ened by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The 20-year-old won all 16 of his meet­ings this year and set the world out­door record of 6.15m in Rome last week and im­proved the world record to 6.18m on the World In­door Tour in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>A vault of 5.82m was enough for him to win again on Friday at the Qatar Sports Club ahead of Amer­i­can Ken­dricks and France’s for­mer Olympic cham­pion Re­naud Lav­il­le­nie, who both cleared the same height but with more fail­ures.</p>
    <p>“It’s been a fan­tas­tic sea­son and I en­joyed shar­ing the mo­ment tonight with the guys,” said Du­plan­tis. “I en­joyed the jump and the ri­valry with Sam. It’s been fun with him as we have al­ways got back at each other.”</p>
    <p>Echo­ing the views of many ath­letes, he added: “It’s been a roller­coaster year, sort of. I broke the in­door world record ear­lier in the year and I was en­joy­ing the sea­son but all of a sud­den the pan­demic came and ev­ery­thing shut down and no one knew what will hap­pen next.</p>
    <p>“It’s great (to be) back and I hope things keep im­prov­ing.”</p>
    <p>He failed once at 5.92m and also 6.00m be­fore call­ing it a day.</p>
    <p>Hen­dricks – the last per­son to beat Du­plan­tis, in Doha’s Khal­ifa Sta­dium at last year’s world cham­pi­onships – was sec­ond on count­back and Lav­il­le­nie third in hu­mid, hot con­di­tions with a tem­per­a­ture of 32 deg C.</p>
    <p>Kenyan Faith Kipye­gon ran the fastest time this sea­son to win the women’s 800m, tak­ing the lead from Spain’s Es­ther Guer­rero around 200m from the end be­fore cruis­ing home for a com­fort­able win in 1 minute 57.68 sec­onds.</p>
    <p>“I am very sur­prised not only with the win but with my record here tonight,” said the Olympic 1,500m cham­pion.</p>
    <p>“The year has been dis­turb­ing and I am glad it is com­ing to an end. We can’t wait enough for 2021.”</p>
    <p>Olympic cham­pion Elaine Thompson-Herah con­tin­ued her im­pres­sive form with an easy win in the women’s 100m. The Ja­maican fin­ished in 10.87sec, with Ivo­rian Marie-Josee Ta Lou a dis­tant 0.34sec be­hind in sec­ond.</p>
    <p>An ex­per­i­men­tal for­mat in the women’s long jump helped Ukraine’s Maryna Bekh-Ro­manchuk to a win.</p>
    <p>In the new sys­tem, the lead­ing three af­ter five rounds go into a “fi­nal three”, the pre­vi­ous re­sults are dis­carded and the ath­lete with the best fi­nal jump wins the con­test.</p>
    <p>Bekh-Ro­manchuk pro­duced 6.91m for her last ef­fort while Nigeria’s Ese Brume was sec­ond with 6.68m. Swe­den’s Khaddi Sag­nia was third with 6.55m.</p>
