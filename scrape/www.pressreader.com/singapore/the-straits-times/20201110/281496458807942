    <p>The man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor is show­ing sur­pris­ing re­silience in the midst of the on­go­ing pan­demic, ramp­ing up its out­put and churn­ing out more jobs.</p>
    <p>There were about 6,370 jobs avail­able in the sec­tor in the mid­dle of last month – al­most dou­ble the 3,200 job open­ings re­ported at the end of Au­gust – it was re­vealed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The sec­tor has emerged as a bright spot in the re­ces­sion-hit econ­omy.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, Sin­ga­pore’s man­u­fac­tur­ing out­put rose by 24.2 per cent, com­pared with the same month last year – the big­gest yearon-year in­crease since De­cem­ber 2011. The growth was driven mainly by the bio­med­i­cal man­u­fac­tur­ing and elec­tron­ics sub-sec­tors, which con­tinue to ex­pand and hire.</p>
    <p>At the same time, seg­ments such as marine and off­shore, which saw out­put con­tract, have been piv­ot­ing to new growth ar­eas to seize op­por­tu­ni­ties even dur­ing the down­time, said the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM).</p>
    <p>They con­tinue to re­quire work­ers to take on new job roles in ar­eas such as au­to­ma­tion and data an­a­lyt­ics, to sup­port their busi­ness trans­for­ma­tion ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Job open­ings make up 61 per cent of the more than 10,400 job, trainee­ship and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties avail­able in the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor, said MOM in its weekly jobs sit­u­a­tion re­port.</p>
    <p>Of the jobs avail­able, seven in 10 are for pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs).</p>
    <p>“We know it takes time for job seek­ers to be fa­mil­iar with th­ese open­ings,” said Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“It is there­fore im­por­tant that we con­tinue to reach out to them so that they see the whole range of op­tions that are avail­able. We will also do our best to get job seek­ers into th­ese avail­able open­ings.”</p>
    <p>Out­reach ef­forts have been stepped up to en­able this, and the re­sults have been en­cour­ag­ing, said Mrs Teo. Place­ments into man­u­fac­tur­ing have al­most tripled from end-June, she added.</p>
    <p>About 2,120 peo­ple have been placed into jobs, trainee­ships and train­ing po­si­tions in the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor as at the mid­dle of last month.</p>
    <p>About 1,350 of them have found jobs. An­other 320 have been placed in trainee­ships and at­tach­ments, while 450 took on train­ing open­ings.</p>
    <p>Within the sec­tor, elec­tron­ics, pre­ci­sion en­gi­neer­ing and food man­u­fac­tur­ing had the most avail­able open­ings.</p>
    <p>Elec­tron­ics en­gi­neers, for in­stance, can earn monthly salaries of be­tween $4,300 and $6,000. The me­dian monthly pay is $4,700.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo also touched on the marine and off­shore sub-sec­tor, in which there are over 800 avail­able open­ings, in­clud­ing 700 jobs.</p>
    <p>About 84 per cent of th­ese jobs are in PMET roles.</p>
    <p>The sub-sec­tor, which em­ploys close to 77,000 work­ers, has been hit hard in the past few years, due largely to weak­ened rig de­mand from the slump in global oil prices.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies also had to stop nonessen­tial work or op­er­ate at re­duced ca­pac­i­ties to com­ply with Covid-19 re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>But hir­ing con­tin­ued among firms in marine ac­tiv­i­ties such as ship re­pair, con­ver­sion, and re­fur­bish­ment dur­ing this pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has ex­tended the en­hanced train­ing sup­port pack­age to en­cour­age com­pa­nies to up­skill their work­ers dur­ing this down­time, in­clud­ing of­fer­ing course fee sub­si­dies.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies have also been tap­ping Work­force Sin­ga­pore’s re­de­ploy­ment pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­grammes (PCPs) to equip work­ers with new skill sets, so that they can take on new roles and sup­port their firms’ move into growth ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo stressed that while com­pa­nies move to new growth ar­eas, their work­ers will also need to pick up new skills and be re­de­ployed.</p>
    <p>She added that even though the sec­tor re­quires highly skilled man­power, those look­ing for a mid-ca­reer switch can tap the PCPs, trainee­ships and at­tach­ments to “help lower the bar­ri­ers to en­try and ease their tran­si­tion”.</p>
    <p>The marine and off­shore sec­tor is fac­ing chal­leng­ing times, but it can still pivot to new ar­eas for longterm growth, said Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a visit to marine en­gi­neer­ing firm Sem­b­corp Marine, he said: “It is per­haps a nat­u­ral ef­fect of the in­dus­try that there will be a cy­cle of peak and trough. Un­for­tu­nately, for us, at this point in time, we are go­ing through a trough of the cy­cle, so the con­di­tions are very chal­leng­ing.”</p>
    <p>The marine and off­shore sec­tor here in­cludes ser­vices that Sin­ga­pore pro­vides to meet the world­wide de­mand for ship re­pair, ship­build­ing, rig-build­ing and off­shore en­gi­neer­ing, as well as oil­field equip­ment man­u­fac­tur­ing, and the build­ing and char­ter­ing of off­shore sup­ply ves­sels.</p>
    <p>It em­ploys close to 77,000 work­ers and is an­chored by Kep­pel Off­shore & Marine, Sem­b­corp Marine and ST En­gi­neer­ing Marine, sup­ported by a net­work of small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs).</p>
    <p>Mr Chan noted that due to the pan­demic, the in­dus­try is be­ing hit by a sharp fall in the global de­mand for oil be­cause of the re­duc­tion in air travel and trans­porta­tion.</p>
    <p>This year, the In­ter­na­tional En­ergy Agency es­ti­mated that global de­mand for oil will drop by about 8.4 per cent, which is the largest fall in his­tory. Pro­duc­tion is also ex­pected to fall to a 15-year low.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause of this, the de­mand for off­shore rigs, with the can­cel­la­tion or de­lay of ex­ist­ing projects, will threaten the rig-build­ing in­dus­try... It is there­fore very im­por­tant for our in­dus­try to have the en­gi­neer­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties to pivot to new ar­eas,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ef­forts by the in­dus­try to trans­form even be­fore the pan­demic have al­ready started pay­ing off, noted Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>An­nual or­ders won by Sin­ga­pore marine and off­shore firms grew from $820 mil­lion in 2016 to $4.5 bil­lion last year.</p>
    <p>Growth ar­eas in­clude liq­ue­fied nat­u­ral gas (LNG), off­shore wind, and smart and dig­i­tal prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore firms se­cured $1.5 bil­lion worth of LNG-re­lated projects and $1 bil­lion worth of off­shore wind-re­lated ones last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan noted that Sem­b­corp Marine has built a gas in­no­va­tion and so­lu­tions cen­tre to fo­cus on de­sign and en­gi­neer­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties for LNG bunker­ing ves­sels, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“With the re­duc­tion in our lo­cal man­power pool and also the con­straints on the for­eign man­power pool, our in­dus­try has heav­ily in­vested in pro­duc­tiv­ity ini­tia­tives that lever­age good up­front de­sign, ad­di­tive man­u­fac­tur­ing pro­cesses, ro­bot­ics and au­to­ma­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Since 2017, the sec­tor has com­mit­ted more than $350 mil­lion in sta­teof-the-art pro­duc­tion tech­nolo­gies, with the three key firms in­vest­ing in mea­sures to raise pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Firms have also in­vested in up­skilling work­ers, with Sem­b­corp Marine groom­ing staff through post­grad­u­ate pro­grammes. Kep­pel Off­shore & Marine sent 134 staff for pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­grammes so they can be re­de­ployed to new roles.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said dur­ing the same visit that op­por­tu­ni­ties pre­sented by tech­nol­ogy can also change the per­cep­tion of the in­dus­try as “dirty, dan­ger­ous and de­mand­ing”.</p>
    <p>“(Firms) are also mov­ing into new busi­ness ar­eas and un­der­stand the im­por­tance of sus­tain­abil­ity. The new 3Ds are de­car­bon­i­sa­tion, deal­ing with dis­rup­tion and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan added: “Today, the in­dus­try is com­pet­ing on the ba­sis that it has the de­sign ca­pa­bil­i­ties and qual­ity as­sur­ance that can al­low ship­yards in Sin­ga­pore to in­te­grate parts of pro­duc­tion from all around the world to be as­sem­bled and qual­i­fied in Sin­ga­pore. And that is how we make a mark for our­selves.</p>
    <p>“Not­with­stand­ing the short-term chal­lenges, we still see prospects for this in­dus­try go­ing for­ward, into the new ar­eas of en­gi­neer­ing so­lu­tions re­quired by the rest of the world.”</p>
