    <p>WASHINGTON • United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump is ea­ger to get back to work in the Oval Of­fice, and safety pro­to­cols are in place if he chooses to do so, said the White House’s chief of staff Mark Mead­ows yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has been work­ing from a makeshift space in his res­i­dence in the White House since Mon­day, when he was dis­charged from hos­pi­tal to con­tinue his Covid-19 treat­ment at home.</p>
    <p>“He wanted to go to the Oval yes­ter­day. If he de­cides to go to the Oval, we’ve got safety pro­to­cols there,” Mr Mead­ows told re­porters, adding that there would be ad­e­quate per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment and ven­ti­la­tion.</p>
    <p>He de­scribed Mr Trump, who has re­ceived treat­ment with a steroid that is nor­mally used in the most se­vere cases, as be­ing “in very good health”.</p>
    <p>There were con­flict­ing ac­counts yes­ter­day over whether Mr Trump had al­ready been back at his of­fice.</p>
    <p>A top aide said the Pres­i­dent had spent time in the Oval Of­fice on Tues­day, but this was later con­tra­dicted by the White House.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment is func­tion­ing,” White House eco­nomic ad­viser Larry Kud­low told CNBC yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“The Pres­i­dent ac­tu­ally showed up in the Oval Of­fice yes­ter­day with ex­tra pre­cau­tions, with re­spect to his Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Trump’s spokesman Ben Wil­liamson said oth­er­wise. “While the Pres­i­dent wanted to be in the Oval Of­fice yes­ter­day, he was not there – he stayed back in the res­i­dence work­ing from there,” tweeted Mr Wil­liamson.</p>
    <p>It had been re­ported ear­lier that some of Mr Trump’s aides do not want the rest­less Pres­i­dent to leave the White House res­i­dence yet but were un­sure how long he would con­tinue to iso­late him­self.</p>
    <p>Aides said that Mr Trump made calls from the White House on Tues­day and roamed the ar­eas of the pres­i­den­tial res­i­dence that had been set up for him.</p>
    <p>Al­though he was de­scribed as itch­ing to get back into his of­fice and show that he was in charge, a po­ten­tial live ad­dress to the na­tion was dis­cussed but scrapped i n favour of a planned taped one.</p>
    <p>His physi­cian re­leased a state­ment on Tues­day af­ter­noon, say­ing the Pres­i­dent re­ported “no symp­toms” of the dis­ease af­ter a “rest­ful first night at home”.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, ad­di­tional mea­sures are be­ing taken to try to con­tain the spread of the coro­n­avirus af­ter a num­ber of White House aides tested pos­i­tive, ac­cord­ing to Mr Mead­ows.</p>
    <p>One of the Pres­i­dent’s mil­i­tary aides, Ms Jayna McCar­ron, tested pos­i­tive, as did one of the Pres­i­dent’s valets, who trav­elled with Mr Trump last week, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>“Ad­di­tional pro­to­cols” have been in­tro­duced, “cor­don­ing off” dif­fer­ent work­ing groups at the White House, Mr Mead­ows said on Fox News yes­ter­day. “A num­ber of pre­cau­tions are in place.”</p>
    <p>The top White House physi­cian, Dr Sean Con­ley, had said that Mr Trump will con­tinue to re­cu­per­ate in iso­la­tion at the White House un­til he is no longer in­fec­tious, but the Pres­i­dent has made clear he is ea­ger to get back to his re-elec­tion cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump and his cam­paign have sought to cast his re­turn from the hos­pi­tal as a tri­umphant pres­i­den­tial moment just weeks be­fore elec­tion day, but he has fallen far be­hind his chal­lenger Joe Bi­den in both pub­lic opinion polls and fund rais­ing.</p>
    <p>A CNN poll taken af­ter Mr Trump’s chaotic first de­bate with Mr Bi­den, re­leased on Tues­day, found the Pres­i­dent trail­ing the for­mer vice-pres­i­dent by 16 points na­tion­ally.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has been look­ing for op­tions on how to get his mes­sage out and cut into Mr Bi­den’s lead in bat­tle­ground states where the Nov 3 elec­tion will be de­cided, ad­vis­ers said. They said they had been dis­cussing Mr Trump de­liv­er­ing a na­tional ad­dress, while a speech to senior vot­ers is be­ing con­tem­plated for to­day.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Trump la­belled Mr Bi­den “wacko” in a tweet linked to a clip of Mr Bi­den on the cam­paign trail telling a group of young dancers he wanted to “see them danc­ing when they’re four years older”.</p>
    <p>“He’s been a wacko for years, and</p>
    <p>ev­ery­one knows it,” Mr Trump tweeted, with re­gard to Mr Bi­den’s ap­par­ent ref­er­ence to his am­bi­tion to be cam­paign­ing for re-elec­tion in four years’ time.</p>
