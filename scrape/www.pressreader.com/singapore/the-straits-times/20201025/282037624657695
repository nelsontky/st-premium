    <p>There are about 80,000 ac­tive golfers in Sin­ga­pore, but more than 50 per cent are above 55 years old.</p>
    <p>At its height, the golf play­ing pop­u­la­tion here was about 120,000, but with the mil­len­ni­als mostly en­gaged in on­line ac­tiv­ity and e-games, this num­ber has since dropped con­sid­er­ably.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Golf As­so­ci­a­tion is fully aware of this, and faces a huge chal­lenge of im­prov­ing on the num­ber of play­ers also be­cause the num­ber of golf cour­ses has been re­duced from 14 to 12 with the loss of Jurong Coun­try Club and Raf­fles Coun­try Club.</p>
    <p>And with some clubs fac­ing lease re­newal un­cer­tain­ties, fur­ther weighed down by the Covid-19 pandemic which has pre­vented travel to Bin­tan, Batam and Jo­hor for play, the task is hu­mon­gous.</p>
    <p>But the dy­namic SGA is tak­ing on the chal­lenge heads-on and is in­creas­ing the pool of ju­nior play­ers – the fu­ture of golf – by or­gan­is­ing age-group com­pe­ti­tions and spe­cialised prac­tice sessions or the young.</p>
    <p>And ac­knowl­edg­ing that golf can be an ex­pen­sive sport, the SGA, which has ar­ranged for sub­sidised games, has taken on an­other pos­i­tive move by or­gan­is­ing a UsedClub Do­na­tion Drive to help po­ten­tial golfers en­joy the game.</p>
    <p>In a call to golfers with spare clubs, the SGA has asked them to do­nate the clubs which will be handed to po­ten­tial golfers who make a min­i­mum do­na­tion of $10 per club and $150 to $200 for a full set (the do­na­tion amount has not been con­firmed).</p>
    <p>The SGA will cir­cu­late the de­tails on posters via so­cial me­dia plat­forms, EDM and web­sites on Oct 24 and 25.</p>
    <p>The phys­i­cal col­lec­tion and dis­tri­bu­tion of the used clubs from the SGA of­fice at Sem­bawang Coun­try Club will be done be­tween Oct 26 and Nov 6 dur­ing of­fice hours.</p>
    <p>In­di­vid­u­als are also wel­comed to “pay it for­ward” by mak­ing dona­tions even if they do not in­tend to get the used golf clubs. All dona­tions can be made on­line through our giv­ing.sg plat­form.</p>
    <p>All dona­tions will be given to with our ben­e­fi­ciary (Hope­full) to achieve the fol­low­ing:</p>
    <p>• Get Golf­ing with Hope­full (20202021), a ground-up ini­tia­tive co­founded by na­tional golfer Jen Goh that cre­ates, gath­ers, and pro­vides en­gag­ing ed­u­ca­tional re­sources for chil­dren and youths from low-in­come fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>• Pro­vide a plas­tic golf set each for 650 chil­dren (4-10 years old) from low i ncome fam­i­lies or chil­dren with in­car­cer­ated par­ents so that they will be in­tro­duced to the game. • In­tro­duce a pro­gramme with a series of ac­ti­va­tion in 2021 dur­ing school holidays to i ntro­duce the game to older kids (11-15 years old; es­ti­mated 30 pax).</p>
