    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES• Amer­i­can direc­tor Martin Scors­ese (left) warned that cinema is be­com­ing “marginalis­ed and de­val­ued” as a “form of com­fort food” dur­ing the coron­avirus pan­demic, as he ad­dressed the Toronto film fes­ti­val on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Scors­ese, no stranger to con­tro­versy af­ter last year slam­ming pop­u­lar su­per­hero block­busters as “not cinema”, spoke as movie the­atres remain closed in ma­jor Amer­i­can cities in­clud­ing Los An­ge­les and New York.</p>
    <p>Toronto, North Amer­ica’s largest film fes­ti­val, is tak­ing place mainly on­line this year, along with a hand­ful of drive-in and lim­ited-ca­pac­ity in­door screen­ings.</p>
    <p>In a short video in­tro­duc­ing the event’s an­nual ca­reer achieve­ment gala, Scors­ese, 77, praised the fes­ti­val for go­ing ahead.</p>
    <p>“The fact that film fes­ti­vals are con­tin­u­ing to hap­pen– im­pro­vis­ing, adapt­ing, mak­ing it all work some­how – is very mov­ing to me,” said the Os­car-win­ning direc­tor of The De­parted (2006).</p>
    <p>“Be­cause in the press and the pop­u­lar cul­ture, what’s hap­pen­ing... it’s be­com­ing sadly com­mon to see cinema marginalis­ed and de­val­ued and, in this sit­u­a­tion, cat­e­gorised sort of as a form of com­fort food.”</p>
    <p>Mil­lions around the world have spent the past few months locked at home due to the pan­demic, with many binge-watch­ing tele­vi­sion and films from their liv­ing rooms.</p>
    <p>In a blis­ter­ing New York Times op-ed last Novem­ber, Scors­ese said movie the­atres are the place “where the film-maker in­tended her or his pic­ture to be seen” and warned that su­per­hero movies were crowd­ing au­teurs off the big screen.</p>
    <p>“To cel­e­brate its very ex­is­tence is all the more im­por­tant and nec­es­sary... this re­mark­able art form has al­ways been and al­ways will be much more t han a di­ver­sion,” added Scors­ese in the video aired on Tues­day. “Cinema, film, movies, at its best, is a source of won­der and in­spi­ra­tion.”</p>
    <p>Bri­tish act­ing royalty An­thony Hop­kins and Kate Winslet re­ceived ca­reer awards at the vir­tual gala from Toronto, where both are pro­mot­ing ac­claimed new films that could land them their sec­ond Os­car awards.</p>
    <p>They de­voted much of their ac­cep­tance speeches, pro­jected in an empty Toronto movie the­atre, to thank­ing emer­gency work­ers.</p>
    <p>Chloe Zhao, direc­tor of early Os­car con­tender No­mad­land, which won the Golden Lion at the Venice film fes­ti­val last week­end, was also recog­nised for her work.</p>
    <p>The Toronto In­ter­na­tional Film Fes­ti­val runs un­til Sun­day.</p>
