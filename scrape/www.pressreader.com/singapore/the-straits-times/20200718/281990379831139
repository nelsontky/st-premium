    <p>No one ex­pected the new Speaker of Malaysia’s Par­lia­ment to get a red car­pet wel­come but nei­ther did any­one imag­ine he would be greeted with such hos­til­ity and re­sent­ment.</p>
    <p>MPs threw deco­rum and pro­to­col to the wind this week as they traded in­sults and screamed at one an­other over the mo­tions to re­move Tan Sri Mohd Ariff Md Yu­sof, a prod­uct of the pre­vi­ous Pakatan Hara­pan gov­ern­ment, as Speaker and re­place him with Datuk Azhar Harun, the for­mer Elec­tion Com­mis­sion chair­man.</p>
    <p>“It was a new low and it all hap­pened on prime time,” said Mr Jeff Ooi, a for­mer MP who writes col­umns in two lead­ing Chi­nese news­pa­pers.</p>
    <p>The very public dis­play of ac­ri­mony was also a sig­nal of what things might be like in the com­ing days for Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin as his Perikatan Na­sional (PN) gov­ern­ment strug­gles to hold on to power with the nar­row­est par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity ever.</p>
    <p>TEST OF NUM­BERS</p>
    <p>It means that ev­ery mat­ter in Par­lia­ment that re­quires a vote will be a test of num­bers for him.</p>
    <p>Chang­ing the Speaker on Mon­day was the first of such tests.</p>
    <p>The vote over the Speaker is­sue was also the first con­fir­ma­tion that Tan Sri Muhyid­din ac­tu­ally has the num­bers to be up there be­cause the Prime Min­is­ter has never pub­licly stated the num­ber of MPs he had af­ter grab­bing power from the Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) gov­ern­ment in March.</p>
    <p>He se­cured a to­tal of 111 votes against 109 votes from the Pakatan side to re­move the for­mer Speaker. The new man was sworn in a cou­ple of hours later amid more heck­ling and boo­ing, plus some racist and sex­ist re­marks fly­ing across the floor.</p>
    <p>“It was a slim but big vic­tory. It should si­lence his crit­ics who said he did not have the num­bers,” said po­lit­i­cal com­men­ta­tor Khaw Veon Szu.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din ac­tu­ally has a to­tal of 113 MPs with him be­cause the Deputy Speaker, Datuk Rashid Has­non, who chaired the ses­sion could not vote, and an­other MP was in hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>That said, his sup­port rests on dan­ger­ously shaky foun­da­tions.</p>
    <p>“His strength is rest­ing on Umno and PAS (Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia) whose MPs form more than half of the gov­ern­ment bench. He has to depend on his fren­e­mies,” said Mr Tawfik Is­mail, a for­mer MP from Jo­hor.</p>
    <p>For now, de­spite the sabre rat­tling, PH does not have the num­bers to re­take Pu­tra­jaya.</p>
    <p>TWO PATHS AHEAD</p>
    <p>There are two bod­ies of opin­ion within PN on what Mr Muhyid­din might do next.</p>
    <p>One is that he will press on with what he has.</p>
    <p>“He does not have much choice, he will have to make do with what he has. It is pos­si­ble he will go a full term un­less some­thing dra­matic hap­pens,” said a PN in­sider.</p>
    <p>This group be­lieves that the op­po­si­tion – which com­prises PH, the Sabah-based Parti Warisan and Tun Dr Ma­hathir Mo­hamad’s loose band of MPs – will not be able to im­prove on its num­bers.</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion was able to unite and come together in op­pos­ing the new Speaker but re­mains di­vided on the is­sue of who should be its can­di­date for prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>PH lead­ers are also not keen on a snap elec­tion. They are aware that their sup­port has gone down, es­pe­cially among the Malays.</p>
    <p>The out­comes of the last five by-elec­tions sug­gest that PH has only about 15 per cent Malay sup­port. This spells dis­as­ter, given that Malays make up about 60 per cent of the elec­torate.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese sup­port, a fixed de­posit for PH, has also slipped, and the coali­tion needs more time to re­build it.</p>
    <p>SEEK A NEW MAN­DATE?</p>
    <p>The other body of opin­ion is that Mr Muhyid­din needs to seek a fresh man­date in­stead of “ex­ist­ing be­tween life and death”, as one Umno politi­cian has put it.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din, who is the pres­i­dent of Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia (Ber­satu), came into power un­der a cloud for hav­ing got the job by lead­ing a “back­door gov­ern­ment” in its ouster of the elected PH gov­ern­ment. But since then, he has gained ground among the elec­torate.</p>
    <p>Part of it has to do with his han­dling of the Covid-19 pan­demic. Peo­ple also seem to have warmed to his no-drama style of lead­er­ship. Much of it has to do with the way he car­ries him­self, and even Umno deputy pres­i­dent Mo­hamad Hasan has told peo­ple in pri­vate con­ver­sa­tions that Mr Muhyid­din is a “gentle­man politi­cian”.</p>
    <p>A pri­vately com­mis­sioned sur­vey in Se­lan­gor, a state known for anti-es­tab­lish­ment sen­ti­ments, showed Mr Muhyid­din’s ap­proval rat­ing among Malays to be an as­ton­ish­ing 91 per cent. His rat­ing among In­di­ans was 65 per cent but only 25 per cent of Chi­nese ap­proved of his lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>The cir­cle around Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din thinks he should ride on his pop­u­lar­ity and call for an early elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The lead­ers of Umno have been the most vo­cal on snap polls.</p>
    <p>Umno, with 37 MPs and the big­gest com­po­nent in the rul­ing coali­tion, is the most or­gan­ised of the par­ties, and con­fi­dent of its sup­port base.</p>
    <p>But can the pop­u­lar­ity of one man carry the coali­tion through these chal­leng­ing times?</p>
    <p>The out­come of the re­cent Sin­ga­pore elec­tion sug­gests that cau­tion is needed in reading the ground; al­though the Gov­ern­ment did well in man­ag­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic and de­spite gen­er­ous stim­u­lus pack­ages, these were not enough to per­suade the elec­torate to hand the rul­ing Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party the strong man­date it sought.</p>
    <p>A hint that Mr Muhyid­din may want to hold on to the present ar­range­ment for a while more came a day af­ter the ran­corous Par­lia­ment meet­ing when a photo of the Prime Min­is­ter, Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi and PAS pres­i­dent Hadi Awang seated in Mr Muhyid­din’s Par­lia­ment of­fice went vi­ral.</p>
    <p>Mr Roslan Shahir, the PAS in­for­ma­tion chief in Se­lan­gor, read it as a show of sol­i­dar­ity among the three lead­ers, say­ing: “The top three get along. There are dif­fi­cul­ties to over­come but I be­lieve they want to move for­ward. This is what the Malays want.”</p>
    <p>THE BIG SEAT HUR­DLE</p>
    <p>Per­haps the big­gest hur­dle in the way of an early elec­tion is the thorny is­sue of seat al­lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The three Malay par­ties in PN – Ber­satu, Umno and PAS – have over­lap­ping claims on the Malay con­stituen­cies. These are seats which they used to fight one an­other for. But they are now on the same side and the dilemma is which party should con­test the seats.</p>
    <p>“Un­til he is able to sort that out, I don’t see Muhyid­din call­ing for elec­tions. He’ll have to take it one day at a time,” said Mr Ooi.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day morn­ing, as MPs started trick­ling in be­fore the start of the Par­lia­ment sit­ting, Mr Muhyid­din no­ticed that for­mer prime min­is­ter Ma­hathir had ar­rived to take his seat on the op­po­si­tion bench.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din walked across the floor with an­other min­is­ter to greet Dr Ma­hathir and they chat­ted for sev­eral min­utes.</p>
    <p>It was an In­sta­gram-wor­thy mo­ment be­cause it was the first time in months that the two men had met or spo­ken.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir has not for­given Mr Muhyid­din for the way the lat­ter took over the gov­ern­ment, and their en­counter was but a fleet­ing de­tente. A few days later, Dr Ma­hathir was back to crit­i­cis­ing the gov­ern­ment for chang­ing the Speaker.</p>
    <p>“The main take­away from all that hap­pened in Par­lia­ment this week is that Muhyid­din has sur­vived the at­tempt to take down his gov­ern­ment. The op­po­si­tion had to con­cede that it does not have the num­bers to re­take Pu­tra­jaya,” said Mr Ooi.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Muhyid­din is not out of the woods yet; the num­bers are too close and a snap elec­tion can­not be dis­counted.</p>
    <p>TEN­U­OUS HOLD</p>
    <p>His strength is rest­ing on Umno and PAS whose MPs form more than half of the gov­ern­ment bench. He has to depend on his ’’ fren­e­mies.</p>
