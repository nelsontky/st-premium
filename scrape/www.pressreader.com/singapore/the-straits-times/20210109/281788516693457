    <p>CAN­BERRA/BRIS­BANE Trav­ellers to Aus­tralia will have to show a neg­a­tive Covid-19 test be­fore they can get on their plane, as the city of Bris­bane went into lock­down af­ter the discovery of a case of a vir­u­lent new coro­n­avirus vari­ant.</p>
    <p>The more than two mil­lion res­i­dents of Bris­bane, Aus­tralia’s third-largest city, are barred from leav­ing their homes for any­thing but es­sen­tial busi­ness for three days from last night, af­ter a worker at a quar­an­tine ho­tel tested pos­i­tive for the new vari­ant, which was first de­tected in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has de­tected sev­eral cases of the vari­ant but this was the first one to ap­pear out­side the quar­an­tine sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has also found a vari­ant that emerged in South Africa in ho­tel quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>It was not known if the ho­tel worker, a cleaner, was in­fected by some­one who ar­rived from Bri­tain, but ev­ery­one would now need to show a neg­a­tive test upon ar­rival in the hope of keep­ing the new strain out, Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son an­nounced.</p>
    <p>He jus­ti­fied the Bris­bane lock­down, given the dan­ger that the new vari­ant could quickly be­come the dom­i­nant strain of the virus. “I know there will be some in Bris­bane ask­ing, ‘Why is this nec­es­sary? There is only one case’. Well, this isn’t any or­di­nary case. This is a very spe­cial case and one that re­quires us to treat things quite dif­fer­ently,” Mr Mor­ri­son said.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has had about 28,500 cases of the coro­n­avirus and some 900 deaths, far fewer than many other coun­tries, partly be­cause of strict bor­der con­trols from the out­set of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Since March, the bor­der has been shut to all non-ci­ti­zens and per­ma­nent res­i­dents, and the num­ber of peo­ple al­lowed back each week has been capped at just over 6,000, with ev­ery­one go­ing into manda­tory ho­tel quar­an­tine at their ex­pense.</p>
    <p>More than 35,000 Aus­tralians have reg­is­tered their in­ten­tion to re­turn, but Mr Mor­ri­son said the num­ber al­lowed back would be cut by nearly half un­til mid-Fe­bru­ary, given the dan­ger of the vari­ant.</p>
    <p>“We can’t put it back in the box. We’ve got to act be­fore we get the cases,” said Ms Jean­nette Young, chief health of­fi­cer of Queens­land, whose cap­i­tal is Bris­bane.</p>
    <p>Other states moved quickly to iso­late Queens­land. Western Aus­tralia said Queens­lan­ders could not travel there, and oth­ers im­ple­mented manda­tory quar­an­tine for ar­rivals from the state.</p>
    <p>Bris­bane res­i­dents out on es­sen­tial busi­ness must wear masks. Fu­ner­als and wed­dings are lim­ited to 20 and 10 peo­ple, re­spec­tively, while en­ter­tain­ment venues will close.</p>
