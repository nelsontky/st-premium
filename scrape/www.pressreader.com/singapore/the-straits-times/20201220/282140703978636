    <p>From vir­tual sup­port groups to re­source shar­ing to mi­cro-grants, ground-up “net­works of care” have sprung up amid the Covid-19 pan­demic to help those in need.</p>
    <p>One such ini­tia­tive, known as Col­lec­tive Aid, sup­ports cul­tural work­ers such as in­de­pen­dent cu­ra­tors, free­lance per­form­ers and tech­ni­cians, par­tic­u­larly those strug­gling to sup­port their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>It is a joint ini­tia­tive by four art spa­ces and col­lec­tives – Grey Projects, Coda Cul­ture, In­ter-Mis­sion and soft/WALL/studs.</p>
    <p>Since Septem­ber, it has given out more than 20 emer­gency mi­cro-grants (rang­ing from $100 to $500) and also of­fers free coun­selling ses­sions, the use of its spa­ces and equip­ment, and other sup­port such as tech con­sult­ing.</p>
    <p>Grey Projects’ founder Ja­son Wee, 41, tells The Sun­day Times that the founders came up with the idea when the Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore in­vited them to be part of its Pro­pos­als For Novel Ways Of Be­ing pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>They won­dered if they could do some­thing in­de­pen­dently in their small spa­ces too.</p>
    <p>“It got us think­ing that maybe we didn’t have to fo­cus so much on mak­ing, but car­ing. Not just a net­work of cir­cu­lat­ing art ob­jects, but a net­work of care,” Wee adds.</p>
    <p>The four groups ended up pool­ing re­sources and funds. So far, more than 50 peo­ple have ben­e­fited from the ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>Grey Projects, whose con­tri­bu­tion is partly sup­ported by fund­ing from Pro­pos­als For Novel Ways Of Be­ing, also ran a book sale in Oc­to­ber to sus­tain its coun­selling hours, which it hopes to ex­tend till at least early next year.</p>
    <p>The help pro­vided by Col­lec­tive Aid is not bound to re­quire­ments such as hav­ing to pro­duce a pro­ject af­ter re­ceiv­ing funds.</p>
    <p>Other forms of col­lec­tive care have sprung up too. For ex­am­ple, Grey Projects also has a pen-pal pro­ject where three artists and writ­ers ex­change hand­writ­ten post­cards with pupils from the YWCA Kids’ Week­day Care pro­gramme, as well as el­derly peo­ple in the Tan­glin and Ghim Moh ar­eas.</p>
