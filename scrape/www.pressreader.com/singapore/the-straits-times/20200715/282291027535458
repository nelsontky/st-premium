    <p>LOS ANGELES • The re­main­der of this sea­son’s PGA Tour will take place with­out spec­ta­tors as the United States bat­tles a resur­gence in the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, tour­na­ment of­fi­cials said on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>In a co­or­di­nated an­nounce­ment, the re­main­ing events on the Tour’s re­vised and con­densed sched­ule con­firmed they will not host fans ow­ing to con­cerns over the Covid-19 dis­ease.</p>
    <p>All five tour­na­ments held since the Tour re­sumed last month af­ter a three-month coro­n­avirus-en­forced shut­down have taken place with­out a gallery.</p>
    <p>Fans had ini­tially been set to re­turn for this week’s Memo­rial tour­na­ment in Dublin, Ohio but that plan was scrapped af­ter a sharp es­ca­la­tion in Covid-19 cases across the United States.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment means there will be no spec­ta­tors at the cli­max of the sea­son, which con­cludes with the FedEx Cup Play-off’s Tour Cham­pi­onship, due to be held from Sept 4 to 7 in At­lanta.</p>
    <p>“These de­ci­sions are never easy,” the event’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor, Al­li­son Fillmore, said in a state­ment, de­scrib­ing the move as the “best de­ci­sion for all in­volved”.</p>
    <p>The two other legs of the play­offs, the Aug 20-23 North­ern Trust at TPC Bos­ton and the Aug 27-30 BMW Cham­pi­onship at Olympia Fields, Illi­nois will also be af­fected.</p>
    <p>Fans will also not be in at­ten­dance at the July 23-26 3M Open in Blaine, Min­nesota and the World Golf Cham­pi­onship-St Jude In­vi­ta­tional in Mem­phis from July 30 to Aug 2.</p>
    <p>The PGA of Amer­ica had al­ready an­nounced that no spec­ta­tors will be al­lowed at the first Ma­jor of the year, the PGA Cham­pi­onship, which will be held at Harding Park, San Fran­cisco from Aug 6 to 9.</p>
    <p>While the lack of a crowd will be dis­ap­point­ing to play­ers, view­ers can at least look for­ward to the re­turn of Tiger Woods at the Memo­rial – the tour­na­ment founded and hosted by Jack Nick­laus.</p>
    <p>The 15-time Ma­jor win­ner will be in ac­tion for the first time since Fe­bru­ary, when he fin­ished last among the play­ers who made the cut at the Ge­n­e­sis In­vi­ta­tional.</p>
    <p>In­juries forced the world No. 14 to pull out of sev­eral events, in­clud­ing the Arnold Palmer In­vi­ta­tional, be­fore the sea­son was shut down in March.</p>
    <p>Woods, 44, has not played on the Tour since its restart, but he will tee off at Muir­field Vil­lage along­side four-time Ma­jor win­ners Brooks Koepka and Rory McIl­roy.</p>
    <p>The reign­ing Mas­ters cham­pion is one vic­tory shy of a PGA Tour mark of 83 wins and while he might be rusty, his record at Memo­rial – he has won it a record five times – au­to­mat­i­cally makes him one of the favourites in the field.</p>
    <p>The sixth-ranked Koepka will look to re­bound af­ter miss­ing the cut last week at the Work­day Char­ity Open, with world No. 1 McIl­roy aim­ing to add an­other vic­tory to his sea­son af­ter win­ning the WGCHSBC Cham­pi­ons.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond of back-to-back events at Muir­field Vil­lage also fea­tures the two most re­cent Tour win­ners, Bryson DeCham­beau and Collin Morikawa, plus five-time Ma­jor win­ner Phil Mick­el­son, mak­ing his 20th start at the tour­na­ment.</p>
