    <p>WASH­ING­TON • United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s Postal Ser­vice chief tried to neu­tralise com­plaints by sus­pend­ing his op­er­a­tional changes, but he failed to si­lence ac­cu­sa­tions that he is ham­per­ing the agency’s abil­ity to han­dle vot­ing by mail.</p>
    <p>Post­mas­ter Gen­eral Louis DeJoy’s re­treat fol­lowed mount­ing pres­sure from Democrats, in­clud­ing an Aug 5 ex­change with top law­mak­ers that Se­nate Mi­nor­ity Leader Chuck Schumer de­scribed as “heated”. Congress sched­uled two hear­ings with Mr DeJoy in the com­ing days and the House plans to vote on a postal­fund­ing mea­sure on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>At heart are con­cerns that Mr Trump, run­ning be­hind Demo­crat Joe Bi­den in polls, is mount­ing a po­lit­i­cally driven cam­paign to hob­ble the Postal Ser­vice. The Pres­i­dent has re­peat­edly claimed – with­out ev­i­dence – that wide­spread mail-in vot­ing leads to fraud.</p>
    <p>Mr DeJoy said on Tues­day that he was sus­pend­ing re­movals of mail­sort­ing ma­chines and blue col­lec­tion boxes in var­i­ous cities, moves that had been billed as over­due cost­cut­ting.</p>
    <p>He pledged that re­tail hours would not change, mail-pro­cess­ing fa­cil­i­ties would not be shut and equip­ment would re­main where it was.</p>
    <p>“Over­time has, and will con­tinue to be, ap­proved as needed.”</p>
    <p>But it re­mains un­clear if changes al­ready made would be re­versed.</p>
    <p>“There are unan­swered ques­tions that cer­tainly need to be clar­i­fied,” said for­mer deputy post­mas­ter gen­eral Ron­ald Stro­man, who was ap­pointed in 2011 and re­signed ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>“You don’t want to re­duce your flex­i­bil­ity ahead of a na­tional elec­tion where you will have an ex­po­nen­tial in­crease in the amount of ab­sen­tee bal­lots,” he said on a call with re­porters hosted by the Democ­racy Fund, where he is a se­nior fel­low.</p>
