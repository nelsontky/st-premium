    <p>A man who sold mo­bile phones has be­come the first per­son in Sin­ga­pore to be charged with fail­ing to reg­is­ter the goods and ser­vices tax (GST) for on­line sales.</p>
    <p>Ed­win Pang Chung Jie, 40, used to own two firms – Ed­mo­bile and Moggi – through which he sold mo­bile phones and ac­ces­sories on plat­forms such as Lazada, Shopee and Carousell.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean was also charged yes­ter­day with two counts of sub­mit­ting in­cor­rect in­come tax re­turns with­out rea­son­able ex­cuse. He is also ac­cused of two counts of fail­ing to keep proper records of the in­voices he re­ceived linked to his busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, the In­land Rev­enue Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (Iras) said that the to­tal amount of tax un­der­charged and the tax due is $129,411.</p>
    <p>On Oct 30, 2013, Pang al­legedly failed to no­tify the Comptrolle­r of GST of his li­a­bil­ity to be reg­is­tered for the tax.</p>
    <p>This is said to have re­sulted in $118,023.23 in tax due for the pe­riod be­tween Dec 1, 2013, and Sept 30, 2015.</p>
    <p>Pang is ac­cused of mak­ing an in­cor­rect re­turn by un­der­stat­ing in­come on April 16, 2014, re­sult­ing in in­come tax un­der­charged to­talling $8,792.87.</p>
    <p>On April 16, 2018, he is said to have un­der­stated his in­come tax re­turn by $26,336.27.</p>
    <p>This al­legedly led to $2,595.74 in in­come tax un­der­charged.</p>
    <p>Pang is also ac­cused of fail­ing to keep proper records of the in­voices on mul­ti­ple oc­ca­sions be­tween Jan 1, 2013, and July 17, 2018.</p>
    <p>Iras said in its state­ment that be­tween 2015 and last year, it re­cov­ered more than $3.8 mil­lion in taxes and penal­ties from 65 au­dit cases on tax­pay­ers who op­er­ate on­line busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>It added: “Like reg­u­lar brickand-mor­tar busi­nesses, all in­come from on­line and e-com­merce busi­nesses in Sin­ga­pore must be re­ported for tax pur­poses.</p>
    <p>“To en­sure that they pay the right amount of taxes, busi­nesses should prac­tise good record-keep­ing by main­tain­ing a full and com­plete phys­i­cal or dig­i­tal record of in­come and ex­penses such as in­voices, re­ceipts, vouch­ers, bank and credit card state­ments, bills, cheques, proof of pay­ments and other doc­u­men­tary ev­i­dence.”</p>
    <p>The court heard that Pang in­tends to ad­mit to his of­fences.</p>
    <p>His bail was set at $40,000 and he will be back in court on Nov 27.</p>
    <p>Fail­ing to reg­is­ter for GST is an of­fence and er­rant busi­nesses may have to pay 10 per cent of GST due as a penalty, and may in­cur a fine of up to $10,000.</p>
