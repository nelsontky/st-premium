    <p>Pub­lic re­la­tions and com­mu­ni­ca­tions ex­ec­u­tive Ja­cob Puthen­param­bil be­lieves in in­vest­ing for the long term with the in­ten­tion of ac­cu­mu­lat­ing wealth for his chil­dren and fu­ture de­scen­dants.</p>
    <p>Money is a util­ity which helps you get things done, said the chief ex­ec­u­tive and founder of com­mu­ni­ca­tions agency Red­hill.</p>
    <p>“We should be care­ful not to waste it and try to build a reser­voir to en­sure a sta­ble fu­ture for gen­er­a­tions to come.”</p>
    <p>The 41-year-old Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent, who was born in In­dia, started his com­pany here in 2014 with $2,000 and no of­fice, staff or other over­heads.</p>
    <p>“My wife had set a con­di­tion that if I did not make enough to pay rent in six months, I should drop it and get a job. That served as great mo­ti­va­tion,” said Mr Puthen­param­bil, whose wife is a com­pli­ance pro­fes­sional. They have three chil­dren aged be­tween two and 13.</p>
    <p>The firm, which pro­vides pub­lic re­la­tions (PR), strat­egy and mar­ket­ing ser­vices, has grown over the past six years to one op­er­at­ing in 14 coun­tries with 85 em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Its rev­enue is around $5 mil­lion an­nu­ally and the firm is prof­itable, he added. This year, it is open­ing its first of­fice in the Mid­dle East, at the Abu Dhabi Global Mar­ket, and has short­listed a few PR and com­mu­ni­ca­tions agen­cies it is in­ter­ested in ac­quir­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Puthen­param­bil, who holds a master’s de­gree in mar­ket­ing com­mu­ni­ca­tions, has also made a few an­gel in­vest­ments in busi­nesses such as me­dia firms DealStreet­Asia and The Morn­ing Con­text.</p>
    <p>He cred­its his long-term in­vest­ment strat­egy to his fam­ily, which has placed its key fo­cus on education and in­vest­ing in busi­nesses with the aim of se­cur­ing a bet­ter fu­ture for the next gen­er­a­tion of fam­ily mem­bers. He and his wife re­gard their in­vest­ments as be­ing very much for the long haul and their chil­dren’s ben­e­fit.</p>
    <p>“I think we make enough to live com­fort­ably, so ev­ery­thing we in­vest in now is for the next gen­er­a­tion and after,” he said.</p>
    <p>Q What is in your per­sonal port­fo­lio? A Although I hold some stocks and in­sur­ance poli­cies, the bulk of my port­fo­lio is in pri­vate in­vest­ments and real es­tate. In most of my in­vest­ments, I was the first in­vestor and know the founder per­son­ally.</p>
    <p>My wife and I have more than 50 per cent of our port­fo­lio al­lo­cated to real es­tate, 30 per cent in pri­vate in­vest­ments, and the rest is i n stocks, in­sur­ance, gold and cash.</p>
    <p>More than 50 per cent of my in­vest­ments are in Sin­ga­pore, with the rest in In­dia and the Mid­dle East.</p>
    <p>I find eq­ui­ties volatile, es­pe­cially dur­ing times of cri­sis like the cur­rent pan­demic. Our eq­uity hold­ings are mostly in industries we are fa­mil­iar with and we hold on to them for the long term. These are usu­ally banks, real-es­tate com­pa­nies and some tech com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Most of our real-es­tate hold­ing is in In­dia, where over the past 15 years we have seen val­ues in­crease sev­eral times while earn­ing good and sta­ble rental in­come. In Ker­ala, we own agri­cul­tural land (cof­fee, car­damom, pep­per, co­conuts) and res­i­den­tial prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>In Lar­naca, Cyprus, we have a hol­i­day home which we rent out. We in­vest long term and given the fam­ily his­tory of own­ing land, it is the most com­fort­able op­tion for us to grow value.</p>
    <p>Q What are your im­me­di­ate in­vest­ment plans?</p>
    <p>A Red­hill is my fo­cus but if there are good an­gel-in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties, I am al­ways open.</p>
    <p>With an­gel in­vest­ing, com­mit­ment of the founder is key. If the founder is full-time and will­ing to go all in, it is a good sign.</p>
    <p>Also, if the idea ad­dresses a niche mar­ket, es­pe­cially B2B (busi­nessto-busi­ness). I be­lieve these types of busi­nesses can gain trac­tion quickly as op­posed to those who have a more B2C (busi­ness-to-con­sumer) fo­cus.</p>
    <p>Q</p>
    <p>How did you get in­ter­ested in in­vest­ing?</p>
    <p>A The first stock I bought was of In­dian util­ity com­pany Tata Power when I was 21. I was work­ing on a project to re­brand and launch ShareKhan, one of In­dia’s first stock-trad­ing plat­forms.</p>
    <p>I re­spect the Tata Group for its busi­ness ethics and set­tled on Tata Power be­cause it had a near mo­nop­oly over elec­tric­ity sup­ply to Mum­bai at the time. It was not a large hold­ing but the stock did well.</p>
    <p>Q Describe your in­vest­ing strat­egy.</p>
    <p>A There are a few fac­tors that have a deep in­flu­ence on my in­vest­ing strat­egy. I think the key fac­tor is</p>
    <p>fam­ily and val­ues that have been passed down over gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Com­ing from a ru­ral land-own­ing agri­cul­tural fam­ily had its ups and downs, par­tic­u­larly in the 1950s when com­mu­nist-in­spired land re­forms were im­ple­mented in my home state of Ker­ala.</p>
    <p>Overnight, the fam­ily had to scram­ble to find new av­enues of in­come and di­ver­sify. This took the fam­ily into busi­ness and in­vest­ment in a lot of new ven­tures.</p>
    <p>The em­pha­sis on qual­ity education also be­came an im­por­tant fac­tor, lead­ing to a lot of pro­fes­sion­als and bu­reau­crats in the fam­ily. To this day, de­spite my fam­ily be­ing spread across the world, we keep in­vest­ing in new ven­tures and education for the younger gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>I think there is an un­said fam­ily motto that one’s pur­pose in this life is to work hard to make life bet­ter for the next gen­er­a­tion. Due to this, our in­vest­ments tend to be for the long term.</p>
    <p>Q</p>
    <p>How are you plan­ning for re­tire­ment?</p>
    <p>A I do not think I am the re­tir­ing type. I had the good for­tune of meet­ing Harold Bur­son, founder of Bur­son-Marsteller, when I was work­ing in his (PR) com­pany. He died last year at 98. He did not re­tire till he was 97. He would go to the of­fice, take meet­ings with new and old clients, travel to in­ter­na­tional of­fices, meet new staff, and more.</p>
    <p>This is some­thing I would love to do. Build­ing a busi­ness from</p>
    <p>ground up and nur­tur­ing it to grow into a legacy busi­ness is deeply sat­is­fy­ing.</p>
    <p>Q</p>
    <p>Money-wise, what were your grow­ing-up years like?</p>
    <p>A My late fa­ther was an en­gi­neer and worked in the fi­bre­glass busi­ness. He started his busi­ness in Ker­ala and then went to work and set up fac­to­ries in the Mid­dle East.</p>
    <p>I grew up mostly in Saudi Ara­bia and the United Arab Emi­rates. I have two younger sis­ters who are en­gi­neers and liv­ing in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>My mother is a house­wife but she man­ages all our as­sets in Ker­ala and in­volves her­self in some phil­an­thropic ac­tiv­i­ties and women’s self­help groups.</p>
    <p>My fam­ily was al­ways fru­gal. I think the only things we splurged on were education and fam­ily cel­e­bra­tions. My fa­ther used to make a big deal out of our birth­days and events like our first holy com­mu­nions.</p>
    <p>The one les­son my fa­ther taught me was to re­spect the busi­ness and the busi­ness will take care of you.</p>
    <p>Q Home is now ...</p>
    <p>A A rented 1,600 sq ft, three-bed­room apartment at The Sum­mit in Up­per East Coast Road.</p>
    <p>Q I drive ...</p>
    <p>A In Sin­ga­pore, we do not need to own a car. We mostly take pub­lic trans­port.</p>
