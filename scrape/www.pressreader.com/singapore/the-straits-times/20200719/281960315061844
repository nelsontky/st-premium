    <p>JAKARTA • More than 400 In­done­sian mem­bers of Tab­ligh, a mul­ti­coun­try Mus­lim mis­sion­ary move­ment, have been taken to In­dian courts over the past few days for vi­o­lat­ing im­mi­gra­tion and quar­an­tine poli­cies in the South Asian coun­try.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Malaysia has brought home from In­dia – via char­tered flight – 62 of its ci­ti­zens who are mem­bers of Tab­ligh, af­ter they were freed of sim­i­lar charges by the In­dian au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>At least 17 of In­dia’s 28 states have re­ported Covid-19 cases linked to a Tab­ligh re­li­gious gath­er­ing i n New Delhi, l ocal me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>Mr Judha Nu­graha, di­rec­tor for ci­ti­zens’ pro­tec­tion at In­done­sia’s For­eign Min­istry, said on Fri­day that 150 In­done­sians went on trial on Tues­day, fol­lowed by 197 on Wed­nes­day and 89 on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>He said the 436 In­done­sians, who were stranded in In­dia af­ter at­tend­ing an Is­lamic gath­er­ing, were ac­cused of vi­o­lat­ing their visas as well as the Epi­demic Dis­ease Act and, there­fore, con­tribut­ing to the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the court hear­ing, most of the de­fen­dants ad­mit­ted to the vi­o­la­tions but said they had not in­tended to break the law.</p>
    <p>The judge has yet to hand down a sen­tence, but ac­cord­ing to pre­vi­ous cases in which Tab­ligh mem­bers from other coun­tries were found guilty, the fines ranged from 5,000 ru­pees (S$93) to 10,000 ru­pees.</p>
    <p>Mr Judha said the In­done­sian gov­ern­ment had pro­vided le­gal as­sis­tance to the ac­cused in­di­vid­u­als, in­clud­ing help­ing them be tem­po­rar­ily re­leased on bail so that they can be housed in bet­ter shel­ters while await­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, 96 Malaysians who were stranded in In­dia, in­clud­ing the 62 Tab­ligh mis­sion­ar­ies, ar­rived at Kuala Lumpur In­ter­na­tional Air­port yes­ter­day morn­ing, the Free Malaysia To­day news site re­ported.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s For­eign Min­is­ter Hisham­mud­din Hus­sein said the Malaysians, who were stranded due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, will un­dergo 14 days of manda­tory quar­an­tine at two des­ig­nated cen­tres.</p>
    <p>The 62 mis­sion­ar­ies had been stranded since March and were de­tained by the In­dian au­thor­i­ties for abus­ing their so­cial visas to carry out re­li­gious ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, a large num­ber have gone through the le­gal process and have been freed of the charges,” Datuk Seri Hisham­mud­din said in a state­ment.</p>
