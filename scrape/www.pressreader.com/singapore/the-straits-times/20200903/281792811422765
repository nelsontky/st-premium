    <p>SYD­NEY • Aus­tralia’s most-pop­u­lous state re­ported the big­gest daily jump in coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions in two weeks yes­ter­day, but said there were no plans to can­cel the New Year fire­works show over Syd­ney Har­bour, as new cases na­tion­ally also ticked up.</p>
    <p>New South Wales (NSW) state re­ported 17 new cases, the big­gest one-day jump since Aug 12, while na­tion­ally the daily count rose to 109 cases from 85 a day ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Victoria state re­mained the hard­est-hit re­gion with 90 cases, al­though this was well down from its daily peak of more than 700 early last month at the height of a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Victoria’s cap­i­tal Mel­bourne, Aus­tralia’s sec­ond-largest city, is in its fifth week of a six-week lock­down with the au­thor­i­ties sched­uled to de­tail on Sun­day a timetable for eas­ing curbs.</p>
    <p>Though strict re­stric­tions have helped to con­tain the spread of the virus, they have wreaked havoc on the econ­omy with of­fi­cial data yes­ter­day show­ing Aus­tralia had en­tered its first re­ces­sion in three decades.</p>
    <p>It en­tered its first re­ces­sion since 1991 af­ter the econ­omy shrank 7 per cent dur­ing the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian Bu­reau of Sta­tis­tics said it was the worst quar­terly con­trac­tion since records be­gan in 1959 and ends a record three­decade run of eco­nomic growth that was un­dented even by the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy shrank 0.3 per cent in the pre­vi­ous three months.</p>
    <p>The coun­try joins the United States, Ja­pan, Bri­tain and Ger­many in tech­ni­cal re­ces­sion, de­fined as two straight quar­ters of de­cline, in Aus­tralia’s first such down­turn since 1991.</p>
    <p>“This cri­sis is like no other,” Trea­surer Josh Fry­den­berg told re­porters in Can­berra.</p>
    <p>“To­day’s na­tional ac­counts con­firm the dev­as­tat­ing im­pact on the Aus­tralian econ­omy from Covid-19. Our record run of 28 con­sec­u­tive years of eco­nomic growth has now of­fi­cially come to an end.”</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has de­tected nearly 26,000 in­fec­tions since the pan­demic be­gan. The na­tional death tally rose to 663 af­ter Victoria re­ported six deaths in the last 24 hours.</p>
    <p>NSW Premier Gla­dys Bere­jik­lian said the state was push­ing ahead with plans to host large events such as the New Year’s Eve fire­works over Syd­ney Har­bour.</p>
    <p>“We should be host­ing events we’ve hosted be­fore but it will be dif­fer­ent,” Ms Bere­jik­lian told re­porters. “I think for a lot of peo­ple the fire­works rep­re­sent hope.”</p>
