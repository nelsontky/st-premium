    <p>While hard­core rental cheats are un­com­mon, the cur­rent re­ces­sion has pro­duced an in­creas­ing trend of ten­ants who ter­mi­nate leases pre­ma­turely due to job losses.</p>
    <p>1 DO PROPER CHECKS ON YOUR TEN­ANTS</p>
    <p>Even if you are ea­ger to find a ten­ant in this mar­ket, you would do well not to take in the first per­son who shows up at the door with­out some due dili­gence.</p>
    <p>The tight­en­ing of bor­der move­ments due to the out­break has cut land­lords’ risk some­what of tak­ing in for­eign ten­ants who hold fake or ex­pired passes. But as the law im­poses stiff penal­ties for the har­bour­ing of il­le­gal im­mi­grants, land­lords should still do care­ful checks on all for­eign ten­ants.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>BE WARY OF RENTAL CHEATS IN A RE­CES­SION</p>
    <p>The owner of a lux­u­ri­ous pen­t­house in the city learnt this painful les­son af­ter he leased his unit to a “se­nior ex­ec­u­tive” of a com­pany for over $30,000 a month.</p>
    <p>The ten­ant, who boasted about his work cre­den­tials, drove a hard bar­gain. Claim­ing that he was keen to rent the unit for the long term, he per­suaded the land­lord to give him three months of free rental in re­turn for a two-year lease that would be paid by his com­pany.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther the land­lord nor the prop­erty agent han­dling the deal sus­pected any­thing, as the ten­ant was very con­vinc­ing and even had a ready and signed agree­ment.</p>
    <p>The ten­ant was able to stay in the pen­t­house for al­most six months even though he failed to pay rent af­ter the ini­tial free pe­riod, cit­ing de­lays due to his com­pany’s cash flow.</p>
    <p>It was only af­ter he van­ished one day that the land­lord found out that he had been duped – a check then re­vealed that the com­pany listed as the lessee of the unit had a paid-up cap­i­tal of only $2.</p>
    <p>In all, the land­lord only re­ceived the ini­tial one-month de­posit and was cheated of more than $150,000 in rent.</p>
    <p>While hard­core rental cheats are un­com­mon, the cur­rent re­ces­sion has pro­duced an in­creas­ing trend of ten­ants who ter­mi­nate leases pre­ma­turely due to job losses.</p>
    <p>Once a ten­ancy agree­ment is signed, ten­ants are obliged to ful­fil the terms, which usu­ally in­cludes com­pen­sa­tion to the land­lord should they leave pre­ma­turely.</p>
    <p>While the law on this mat­ter is clear, en­forc­ing this in the event of a de­fault is an­other mat­ter al­to­gether. SingCap­i­tal chief ex­ec­u­tive Al­fred Chia has come across cases in­volv­ing for­eign ten­ants who had to leave Sin­ga­pore af­ter be­ing re­trenched re­cently.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>PRU­DENT TO HAVE AN ALL-RISK HOME IN­SUR­ANCE</p>
    <p>All land­lords should check that they have ad­e­quate home in­sur­ance to cover against pos­si­ble mishaps that are caused by their ten­ants.</p>
    <p>Note that if you take a home loan from a bank, the bank re­quires you to take a ba­sic fire in­sur­ance for your prop­erty, but that pol­icy usu­ally does not in­clude cov­er­age for dam­ages to your home in­te­ri­ors and con­tents.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Mr Chia, many home own­ers do not have ad­e­quate home in­sur­ance sim­ply be­cause few agents go around ped­dling such in­sur­ance as they do not earn much from th­ese af­ford­able poli­cies.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, a stan­dard fire in­sur­ance may cost less than $100 a year and even an all-risk in­sur­ance starts from only about $200.</p>
    <p>For land­lords, it pays to have bet­ter cov­er­age in case the ten­ants’ chil­dren run around and knock down and smash your flat-screen TV.</p>
    <p>If you are rent­ing out a lux­u­ri­ous pen­t­house with ex­pen­sive fit­tings, paint­ings and chan­de­liers, you may need a “mas­ter­piece” pol­icy to ad­e­quately cover th­ese items.</p>
    <p>For an ex­tra $50, some poli­cies also cover the “le­gal li­a­bil­ity” of your ten­ants.</p>
    <p>“This is use­ful to avoid headaches in case you dis­cover dam­ages, such se­ri­ous burn marks on your floor and wall tiles af­ter your ten­ants have left,” Mr Chia notes.</p>
    <p>But such poli­cies do not cover “wear and tear”, such as the chok­ing of pipes, even though this may be the re­sult of ten­ants’ in­con­sid­er­ate be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>4 SET OUT CLEAR TERMS ON RE­PAIRS</p>
    <p>Some land­lords are penny wise but pound fool­ish – they pro­vide old and cheap house­hold ap­pli­ances such as sec­ond-hand wash­ing ma­chines for their ten­ants and when th­ese items break down, they end up spend­ing hun­dreds of dol­lars for re­peated re­pairs.</p>
    <p>To avoid squab­bling, both sides should dis­cuss and agree on who should pay for what – for in­stance, ten­ants can be asked to ser­vice air­con units if there is wa­ter leak­age due to pro­longed use, while land­lords are re­spon­si­ble for re­pairs if the com­pres­sor breaks down.</p>
    <p>House­hold re­pairs are com­mon dis­putes of ten­an­cies even when par­ties agree on how costs should be split – they some­times quar­rel over the choice of re­pair­men who turn out to be more costly than ex­pected.</p>
    <p>So don’t be­lieve any­one who tells you that a prop­erty in­vest­ment is a sure-win. Just like any other in­vest­ment, it pays to do your home­work so you don’t end up as an as­set-rich but cash-poor prop­erty owner.</p>
