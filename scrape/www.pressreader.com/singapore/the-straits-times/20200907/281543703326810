    <p>Team sports venues are es­pe­cially suf­fer­ing de­spite the re­open­ing of Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy, ow­ing to strict lim­its on num­bers and safe dis­tanc­ing curbs to con­trol the spread of the coron­avirus. But while rev­enues at fut­sal fa­cil­ity op­er­a­tors have dived, The Cage is in­no­vat­ing by of­fer­ing a foot­ball fit­ness pro­gramme for am­a­teurs.</p>
    <p>Weeknights at The Cage used to be over­flow­ing with adren­a­line and goals as fut­sal play­ers flocked to Kal­lang to get their foot­ball fix. These days how­ever, Rajesh Mulani is of­ten greeted with si­lence as he stares at the six empty pitches.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the coron­avirus pan­demic, the fa­cil­ity would usu­ally be fully booked with up to 20 dif­fer­ent groups there dur­ing the 7pm-11pm peak pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Co-owner Mulani now sees an av­er­age of three groups each night and said his busi­ness has been badly af­fected de­spite help from the Gov­ern­ment’s Jobs Sup­port Scheme, which co-pays salaries to help firms re­tain work­ers.</p>
    <p>He es­ti­mated The Cage, which has pitches in Kal­lang, Turf City and MacPherson, is op­er­at­ing at 20 per cent util­i­sa­tion while rev­enue has fallen by 80 per cent.</p>
    <p>His run­ning costs across all three venues, ex­clud­ing rent which is be­ing ne­go­ti­ated with the Sin­ga­pore Land Au­thor­ity, are be­tween $70,000 and $80,000 monthly.</p>
    <p>“The deal-breaker is the ‘group of five’ lim­i­ta­tion be­cause we’re set up as a team sports venue and foot­ball is our main thing but foot­ball can’t hap­pen,” the 50-year-old said.</p>
    <p>Sports and phys­i­cal ac­tiv­i­ties had re­sumed in Phase 2 of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing in June but for team sports like fut­sal, groups are capped at five peo­ple with no in­ter­mix­ing be­tween groups al­lowed.</p>
    <p>For in­di­vid­ual sports like bad­minton, bowl­ing or snooker, these lim­its are less dis­rup­tive for play­ers com­pared to those keen for a game of fut­sal, which is usu­ally a five-aside match.</p>
    <p>Char­lene Chai, mar­ket­ing di­rec­tor of snooker hall King’s Pool, said rev­enue has dropped by 40 per cent with a max­i­mum of 50 peo­ple al­lowed in its hall.</p>
    <p>She said: “The de­mand is there be­cause there are fewer ta­bles pro­vided.”</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion is far more dire for The Cage and its com­peti­tors.</p>
    <p>Sta­dio Fut­sal Sin­ga­pore, which has 10 courts across five venues and is co-owned by for­mer Li­ons coach V. Sun­dram Moor­thy and cur­rent Balestier Khalsa coach Marko Kral­je­vic, now re­ceives just one or two book­ings a week and rev­enue has dived by 90 per cent.</p>
    <p>“Now the big­gest chal­lenge for us is to pay rent and if things be­come worse, we may have to make a busi­ness de­ci­sion and close some out­lets,” said Kral­je­vic, who de­clined to re­veal the com­pany’s fixed monthly costs.</p>
    <p>Ko­van Sports Cen­tre, which has eight fut­sal courts, has seen a sim­i­lar drop in at­ten­dance, even with dis­counts of up to 50 per cent.</p>
    <p>Its of­fice man­ager Dolly Ng said: “We do not fore­see any im­prove­ment in our busi­ness if the cur­rent quota of five peo­ple per court is not lifted. The younger kids are not com­ing be­cause their par­ents are con­cerned about their kids get­ting in­fected. Adults are not com­ing be­cause it makes no sense to play fut­sal in groups of five.”</p>
    <p>While na­tional agency Sport Sin­ga­pore has grad­u­ally been eas­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures – its lat­est ad­vi­sory on Aug 27 said more open spa­ces were made avail­able for large out­door ex­er­cise classes, with a cap of 50 stu­dents sub­ject to venue ca­pac­ity and safe dis­tanc­ing rules – it re­mains un­clear when the five-per­son group limit will be al­tered.</p>
    <p>Ter­rence Wong, di­rec­tor of Go­lazo Fut­sal Sin­ga­pore, lamented how dis­counts and pro­mo­tions are not enough to bring back the crowds. Its usual hourly rates of $90 were low­ered to $50 and then to $10 – for a lim­ited pe­riod last month – but book­ings for their four courts still dropped by 80 per cent.</p>
    <p>To re­duce costs, Wong, 38, is ap­ply­ing for sub­si­dies from gov­ern­ment agen­cies and for de­fer­ment of pay­ment for rent, which is a four-fig­ure sum, and util­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 cri­sis and drop in foot­fall has forced The Cage and its own­ers to ex­plore other ways to bring in rev­enue. It launched a foot­ball fit­ness pro­gramme for am­a­teurs last month.</p>
    <p>Classes, which in­clude a com­bi­na­tion of foot­ball drills and high-in­ten­sity in­ter­val train­ing, last an hour and run thrice a night from Mon­days to Thurs­days. They cost $15 per per­son and are con­ducted by for­mer Balestier de­fender Sofiyan Ab­dul Hamid.</p>
    <p>Of the 12 classes ev­ery week, nearly 10 are full, said Mulani.</p>
    <p>“We’ve come to terms that we do need to in­no­vate, that we do need to find dif­fer­ent uses for our fields,” he said, adding that The Cage is also look­ing to host other fit­ness classes and ac­tiv­i­ties at its premises.</p>
    <p>Lawyer Ruthra Ram, 36, ad­mit­ted while this does not beat play­ing a proper foot­ball game, it is “the best op­tion we’ve got”.</p>
    <p>“If the five of us just kicked the ball around for one hour, there’s lit­tle that can be done and we’ll be tired af­ter 15 min­utes,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But here, there’s a struc­ture and ev­ery drill is dif­fer­ent, so in­stead of giv­ing up af­ter 15 min­utes, you push on till the next drill. This keeps your mind ac­tive and it makes things in­ter­est­ing.”</p>
    <p>HUGE PROB­LEM The deal-breaker is the ‘group of five’ lim­i­ta­tion be­cause we’re set up as a team sports venue and foot­ball is our main thing but foot­ball can’t hap­pen. RAJESH MULANI, co-owner of fut­sal venue The Cage, on the strict rules.</p>
