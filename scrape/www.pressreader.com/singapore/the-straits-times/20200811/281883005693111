    <p>In March, Mr Gur­jeet Singh and his fam­ily were in the Gur­d­wara Har Rai Sahib in Kabul af­ter a sui­cide bomber at­tacked the place of wor­ship, killing 25 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The 30-year-old shop­keeper’s fa­ther was among those killed, and his six-year-old daugh­ter suf­fered a shrap­nel in­jury in one eye.</p>
    <p>The at­tack left Mr Singh, who had grown up in Kabul, in a dilemma.</p>
    <p>“It’s very dif­fi­cult to leave the land where you have grown up,” he said. “When they can en­ter the gur­d­wara and carry out such an at­tack, our lives are not safe any more.”</p>
    <p>Last month, he and his fam­ily packed their be­long­ings into half a dozen bags and re­lo­cated to In­dia to carve out a new life.</p>
    <p>“My heart is bro­ken,” said Mr Singh, as he sat on a dou­ble bed in a small room with his wife and three chil­dren at the Rak­ab­ganj Gur­d­wara in cap­i­tal city Delhi.</p>
    <p>Around 100 more Sikhs are ex­pected in the com­ing weeks, with the In­dian gov­ern­ment fa­cil­i­tat­ing evac­u­a­tions for those des­per­ate to es­cape the cy­cle of vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>Sikhism spread to Afghanista­n in the early 16th cen­tury dur­ing the visit of the re­li­gion’s founder Guru Nanak.</p>
    <p>Mr In­der­jeet Singh, a his­to­rian who has chron­i­cled the life of the com­mu­nity said it was once rich and pros­per­ous, num­ber­ing well over 60,000 in the early 1990s. But their num­bers have de­clined.</p>
    <p>Now, the com­mu­nity num­bers around 600, con­cen­trated mainly in Kabul, Jalal­abad and Ghazni. Most are shop­keep­ers or traders.</p>
    <p>In July 2018, a con­voy of Sikh and Hindu com­mu­nity leaders were at­tacked by an Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) sui­cide bomber in the eastern city of Jalal­abad. Nine­teen peo­ple were killed.</p>
    <p>Afghan Sikhs face a tough choice of start­ing over in an un­fa­mil­iar coun­try or risk­ing an un­cer­tain fu­ture by re­main­ing where they are.</p>
    <p>Kabul’s Gur­d­wara Kar­tae Par­wan pres­i­dent Gur­nam Singh said: “Afghanista­n is no longer ours. We want to save our lives and it has be­come our com­pul­sion.”</p>
    <p>Mr Gur­nam Singh, who has four chil­dren be­tween the ages of 12 and 20, said he will even­tu­ally leave Afghanista­n. “We don’t know when the Tale­ban or Daesh (an­other name for ISIS) will come for us.”</p>
    <p>For Afghan Sikhs, In­dia is their best means of es­cape. The process of mi­gra­tion, com­pli­cated by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, takes far longer in other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s Sikh com­mu­nity has pledged its help. “We will do ev­ery­thing that we can to help the fam­i­lies out. We will help them with the ed­u­ca­tion of their chil­dren,” said Mr Man­jin­der Singh Sirsa, pres­i­dent of the Delhi Sikh Gur­d­wara Man­age­ment Com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>In­dia and Afghanista­n share close ties, with New Delhi hav­ing spent since 2002 more than US$3 bil­lion (S$4.12 bil­lion) to build in­fra­struc­ture from schools to dams in the re­con­struc­tion ef­fort.</p>
    <p>There was dis­quiet in Afghanista­n when In­dia passed its con­tro­ver­sial Cit­i­zen­ship Amend­ment Act last year that fast tracks cit­i­zen­ship for non-Mus­lims from Afghanista­n, Bangladesh and Pak­istan.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Ex­ter­nal Af­fairs had clar­i­fied at the time that the Afghan gov­ern­ment had ad­dressed the con­cerns of mi­nori­ties.</p>
    <p>Former Afghan pres­i­dent Hamid Karzai even told the Hindu news­pa­per early this year there were no per­se­cuted mi­nori­ties in the coun­try as the en­tire coun­try, in­clud­ing Mus­lims, was equally per­se­cuted.</p>
    <p>In­dia is al­ready home to about 20,000 Afghan Sikhs, many of whom have lived here for decades.</p>
    <p>But a sub­stan­tial num­ber are still largely un­able to gain cit­i­zen­ship, let alone ac­cess the gov­ern­ment ben­e­fits that come with it.</p>
    <p>Min­istry of Ex­ter­nal Af­fairs spokesman Anurag Sri­vas­tava said at a re­cent brief­ing that the gov­ern­ment would con­sider cit­i­zen­ship for Afghan Sikhs.</p>
    <p>“Their cause for per­ma­nent set­tle­ment will be ex­am­ined and will be fa­cil­i­tated as per ex­ist­ing rules and poli­cies... We are in touch with oth­ers who would like to re­turn and we will fa­cil­i­tate their re­turn,” he said.</p>
