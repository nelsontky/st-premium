    <p>HONG KONG The Hong Kong gov­ern­ment has for­mally com­plained about the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s move to la­bel im­ports from the city as “Made in China” rather than “Made i n Hong Kong”, as the United States and China con­tinue to spar on fronts rang­ing from trade and tech­nol­ogy to hu­man rights.</p>
    <p>Sec­re­tary for Com­merce and Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Ed­ward Yau yes­ter­day met the Act­ing US Con­sul Gen­eral in Hong Kong, Mr Paul Horowitz, and asked him to sub­mit a let­ter of com­plaint to US Trade Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Robert Lighthizer.</p>
    <p>“Such reg­u­la­tions go con­trary to WTO (World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion) reg­u­la­tions and in­fringe upon our rights as a sep­a­rate Cus­toms re­gion,” Mr Yau told re­porters. “We are a sep­a­rate, and in­deed, in­de­pen­dent mem­ber of the WTO.” He said Hong Kong re­served the right to seek dis­pute set­tle­ment at the WTO.</p>
    <p>The com­ments came a day after the WTO ruled that ad­di­tional tar­iffs im­posed by the US against</p>
    <p>China in 2018 were in­con­sis­tent with global trad­ing rules.</p>
    <p>The fi­nan­cial hub had pre­vi­ously com­plained about the Amer­i­can move, which takes ef­fect on Nov 9. It comes after the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion re­scinded Hong Kong’s spe­cial sta­tus un­der US law, part of a push­back against China’s crack­down in the city. Hong Kong returned to Chi­nese rule in 1997 un­der a “one coun­try, two sys­tems” agree­ment that promised it a high de­gree of au­ton­omy for 50 years.</p>
    <p>Many credit its un­bri­dled cap­i­tal­ism, guar­an­tees of rights and free­doms, and in­de­pen­dent le­gal sys­tem with help­ing Hong Kong to pros­per as a global fi­nan­cial hub and in­ter­face for China and the world.</p>
    <p>But crit­ics say the new se­cu­rity law, tar­get­ing ac­tiv­i­ties that Bei­jing con­sid­ers to be sub­ver­sion, se­ces­sion­ism, ter­ror­ism or col­lu­sion with for­eign forces, ef­fec­tively brings Hong Kong closer to China’s au­thor­i­tar­ian sys­tem. Sup­port­ers of the law say it will bring sta­bil­ity after a year of anti-gov­ern­ment protests.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing are wag­ing a broader tit-for-tat bat­tle on every­thing from sanc­tions on each other’s of­fi­cials to re­stric­tions on jour­nal­ists based in their re­spec­tive coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, the US State De­part­ment up­dated its travel ad­vi­sory on Hong Kong, warn­ing that China now “uni­lat­er­ally and ar­bi­trar­ily ex­er­cises pol­icy and se­cu­rity power in Hong Kong”.</p>
