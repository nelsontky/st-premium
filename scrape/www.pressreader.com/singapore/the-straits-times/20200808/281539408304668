    <p>De­spite its in­dus­trial, rus­tic and im­pos­si­bly boxy styling, the Land Rover De­fender (be­low) has die-hard fans all over the world. Af­ter about seven decades and more than two mil­lion units built, Land Rover stopped pro­duc­ing the orig­i­nal model five years ago. Now, the new-gen­er­a­tion De­fender is here, and it is mas­sive.</p>
    <p>The Land Rover De­fender is prob­a­bly the most un­likely cult car there is. De­spite its in­dus­trial, rus­tic and im­pos­si­bly boxy styling, the car has die-hard fans all over the world.</p>
    <p>Af­ter about seven decades and more than two mil­lion units built, Land Rover stopped pro­duc­ing the orig­i­nal model five years ago.</p>
    <p>Now, the new-gen­er­a­tion De­fender is here and could well make his­tory all over again.</p>
    <p>The car is mas­sive, mea­sur­ing 5,018mm long and 2,008mm wide (with wing mir­rors folded), with a wheel­base of 3,022mm.</p>
    <p>And stand­ing at 1,967mm without roof rails, it is the tallest model in the Land Rover fam­ily. With roof rails, it is nearly 2.2m, mak­ing it in­ac­ces­si­ble to some cov­ered carparks even if you lower the ride height.</p>
    <p>The De­fender weighs 2,361kg. While not ex­actly feath­er­weight, it would have been much heav­ier if not for its alu­minium build.</p>
    <p>A car with its di­men­sions and weight is typ­i­cally night­mar­ish at the wheel. But the new De­fender sur­prises with a won­der­fully set­tled chas­sis, su­perb steer­ing feel and a dy­namic per­for­mance a ve­hi­cle half its size would be proud to have.</p>
    <p>These traits are at­trib­ut­able chiefly to two things.</p>
    <p>One, the car boasts a mono­coque con­struc­tion, un­like its pre­de­ces­sor’s lad­der frame. This gives it high ridig­ity, which con­trib­utes to its road han­dling.</p>
    <p>Two, the car has in­de­pen­dent air sus­pen­sion all round, which gives it a limou­sine-like ride.</p>
    <p>Still, it is a feat to make such a huge and heavy ve­hi­cle that is so well-be­haved, es­pe­cially when it sits on 20-inch wheels shod with high-pro­file all-ter­rain tyres.</p>
    <p>On the go, the De­fender be­trays wind noise be­yond 90kmh, its turn­ing cir­cle is wide and its wing mir­ror an­gles are nar­row. Yet, it is among the most drive­able and plea­sur­able sport util­ity ve­hi­cles (SUVs) in town. In­deed, it even sur­passes some sedans in the ride and han­dling depart­ment.</p>
    <p>Its 400hp 3-litre in­line-six twin­charged en­gine is paired with an eight-speed au­to­box – a com­bi­na­tion found in newer Land Rover and Range Rover mod­els.</p>
    <p>It has 550Nm of torque from 2,000rpm, giv­ing the gi­ant a suf­fi­ciently breezy com­mute, es­pe­cially in Sport mode. On dry tar­mac, the car is rear-bi­ased. But a cen­tre dif­fer­en­tial ap­por­tions torque be­tween axles when slip­page oc­curs.</p>
    <p>Push-but­ton ter­rain se­lect takes the guess­work out of off-road driv­ing, with as­sis­tance pro­grams to make climb­ing and de­scend­ing hills more man­age­able.</p>
    <p>The car re­tains the rugged go-any­where ca­pa­bil­ity of its pre­de­ces­sor. It can climb slopes of up to 45 de­grees, even if its ap­proach and de­par­ture an­gles dif­fer from the pre­vi­ous 110’s. It will wade across streams of up to 900mm deep ver­sus 500mm for its pre­de­ces­sor.</p>
    <p>The new car clearly sports a more mod­ern de­sign, but re­mains ma­cho and an­gu­lar. Fea­tures such as an air in­take snorkel and alpine win­dows are car­ried over.</p>
    <p>Inside, the car is sig­nif­i­cantly more lux­u­ri­ous and re­fined. But the cabin is lined with rub­ber mats be­neath the car­pet­ing and the boot floor is scratch-re­sis­tant.</p>
    <p>You get a mod­ern in­fo­tain­ment sys­tem, 360-de­gree cam­era, a rear</p>
    <p>view mir­ror with rear-view cam­era func­tion, a soft-closing tail­gate and a mini chiller. And it has a “hold” func­tion, which is ac­ti­vated by press­ing hard on the brake pedal.</p>
    <p>Econ­omy-wise, it av­er­aged 15 litres/100km – sub­stan­tially higher than its de­clared 9.9 litres/100km, but sim­i­lar to what SUVs of its size and power re­turn in real life.</p>
    <p>None of the other SUVs, how­ever, can match the De­fender’s blend of us­abil­ity, lux­ury and cult sta­tus.</p>
