    <p>Un­der­arm pads, in­soles and shoe lin­ings that can en­able faster evap­o­ra­tion of sweat than con­ven­tional ones could soon be­come a re­al­ity in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>A team of five re­searchers from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) re­cently de­vel­oped a new mois­ture-ab­sorb­ing film that is able to ab­sorb the mois­ture from sweat six times faster and hold 15 times more mois­ture than con­ven­tional ma­te­ri­als.</p>
    <p>The sci­en­tists also found that the film, when moist, can be tapped to gen­er­ate elec­tric­ity to power wear­able elec­tronic de­vices such as watches and fit­ness track­ers.</p>
    <p>The film is made mainly from two wa­ter-ab­sorb­ing chem­i­cals – cobalt chlo­ride and ethanolami­ne, which are known for their high mois­ture ab­sorbency rate.</p>
    <p>As the ma­te­rial has a strong ten­dency to at­tract mois­ture, it is able to force the sweat from one’s skin sur­face to va­por­ise, thus quick­en­ing the pace of nat­u­ral sweat evap­o­ra­tion, said As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Tan Swee Ching from NUS’ Depart­ment of Ma­te­rial Sci­ence and En­gi­neer­ing, who is leader of the re­search team. “As the sweat evap­o­rates from our skin a lot quicker, it ab­sorbs heat from our skin sur­face, mak­ing us feel cooler es­pe­cially on hot and hu­mid days.”</p>
    <p>The film is also able to re­lease wa­ter when ex­posed to sun­light, hence it can be “regenerate­d” and reused more than 100 times.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, con­ven­tional sweat pads are made mainly from ma­te­ri­als such as ze­o­lites and sil­ica gels which have low wa­ter up­take, mak­ing them less ef­fi­cient in mois­ture ab­sorp­tion.</p>
    <p>In in­cor­po­rat­ing the film in shoe in­soles and un­der­arm pads, it is placed be­tween two sheets of poly­te­traflu­o­rethy­lene, or Te­flon, com­monly used in cloth­ing for its breatha­bil­ity and wa­ter­proof na­ture.</p>
    <p>As proof of con­cept, a shoe in­sole pro­to­type with the film em­bed­ded was cre­ated us­ing 3D print­ing.</p>
    <p>“The ma­te­rial (of the shoe in­sole) is a mix­ture of soft poly­mer and hard poly­mer, thus pro­vid­ing suf­fi­cient sup­port and shock ab­sorp­tion,” said Pro­fes­sor Ding Jun, also from the NUS depart­ment and a mem­ber of the re­search team.</p>
    <p>But the re­searchers’ work did not end there. Dis­cov­er­ing that elec­tri­cal cur­rents can pass through the film when it is moist, the team de­cided to make use of this prop­erty to gen­er­ate power.</p>
    <p>The film was first com­bined with a zinc foil and a cop­per foil, which served as the neg­a­tive and pos­i­tive elec­trodes, re­spec­tively. When the film ab­sorbed mois­ture, elec­trons moved eas­ily from the zinc foil to the cop­per foil, thereby cre­at­ing an elec­tri­cal cur­rent.</p>
    <p>This film-and-foil com­bi­na­tion thus func­tioned as an elec­tro­chem­i­cal cell, with each cell able to gen­er­ate some 0.57 volt of elec­tric­ity.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral of these elec­tro­chem­i­cal cells can be con­nected to­gether to form a power source for wear­able elec­tronic de­vices such watches.</p>
    <p>To demon­strate this, eight cells were as­sem­bled to­gether in a gad­get to power an LED light. Both the gad­get and LED light were at­tached to a T-shirt, which was then worn by a per­son who went for a 10-minute run. The mois­ture from his sweat – ab­sorbed by the films – en­abled elec­tric­ity to be gen­er­ated in the gad­get, turn­ing the LED light on.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, ex­ces­sive un­der­arm sweat­ing can con­trib­ute to bac­te­ria growth and cause un­pleas­ant body odour. Ac­cu­mu­la­tion of per­spi­ra­tion in the shoes can also lead to blis­ters, cal­luses and fun­gal in­fec­tions, noted Prof Tan. “Us­ing the mois­ture-ab­sorb­ing film, the mois­ture from sweat is rapidly taken in, pro­vid­ing a dry and cool mi­cro­cli­mate for per­sonal com­fort.”</p>
    <p>The team hopes to work with com­pa­nies to in­cor­po­rate the film into con­sumer prod­ucts.</p>
