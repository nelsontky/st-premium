    <p>• Aus­tralia’s Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son has said he was open to dis­cus­sions over whether Aus­tralian mass killer Bren­ton Tar­rant, jailed for life with­out pa­role this week for the New Zealand mosque shoot­ings, should serve his sen­tence in his home coun­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son told broad­caster Chan­nel Seven yes­ter­day he had not re­ceived a for­mal re­quest from New Zealand for such a trans­fer, al­though New Zealand’s Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Win­ston Peters sug­gested it af­ter Tar­rant was sen­tenced on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“We’ll have an open dis­cus­sion and look at the is­sues around this,” Mr Mor­ri­son said, adding that the views of the af­fected fam­i­lies must be con­sid­ered first.</p>
    <p>“I know all Aus­tralians and all New Zealan­ders would want to see this char­ac­ter locked up for­ever and never see the light of day again. And I agree with that. Whether he’s held in New Zealand or Aus­tralia.”</p>
    <p>Tar­rant, who grew up in a ru­ral town north of Syd­ney, ad­mit­ted to 51 charges of mur­der, 40 counts of at­tempted mur­der and one charge of com­mit­ting a ter­ror­ist act for the 2019 shoot­ing ram­page at two mosques in Christchur­ch.</p>
    <p>While Aus­tralia and New Zealand have close visa ar­range­ments, they do not have a pris­oner trans­fer deal, cre­at­ing a hur­dle to any near-term change in Tar­rant’s im­pris­on­ment. Spe­cial se­cu­rity mea­sures for Tar­rant are ex­pected to cost tax­pay­ers NZ$3.6 mil­lion (S$3.3 mil­lion) over two years or nearly NZ$5,000 a day, ac­cord­ing to New Zealand gov­ern­ment es­ti­mates.</p>
    <p>The is­sue of Tar­rant’s na­tion­al­ity was raised sev­eral times dur­ing this week’s sen­tenc­ing hear­ings in Christchur­ch. High Court Judge Cameron Man­der said he be­lieved Tar­rant came to New Zealand to carry out the at­tacks to cause fear in what is oth­er­wise one of the safest coun­tries in the world.</p>
    <p>Mr John Milne, who lost a son in the shoot­ing ram­page, told the court on Wed­nes­day that Tar­rant had to be sent “back to Aus­tralia where he came from”.</p>
