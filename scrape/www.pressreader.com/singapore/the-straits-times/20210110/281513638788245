    <p>“It’s a good thing, him not show­ing up. He’s been an em­bar­rass­ment to the coun­try... He’s not fit to serve... He ex­ceeded even my worst no­tions about him... He’s one of the most in­com­pe­tent pres­i­dents in the his­tory of the United States of Amer­ica.”</p>
    <p>U.S. PRES­I­DENT-ELECT JOE BI­DEN, on Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s an­nounce­ment that he will not be at­tend­ing the in­au­gu­ra­tion cer­e­mony on Jan 20.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter per­ma­nently sus­pended Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ac­count on Fri­day due to “the risk of fur­ther vi­o­lence”, two days af­ter it tem­po­rar­ily locked him out and warned that he would be banned for good if he con­tin­ued to in­cite vi­o­lence and share false claims of elec­toral fraud.</p>
    <p>The ban was part of the deep­en­ing fall­out from last Wed­nes­day’s mob at­tack on the Capi­tol, which many in Wash­ing­ton saw as hav­ing been in­cited by Mr Trump, as Congress was cer­ti­fy­ing Pres­i­den­t­elect Joe Bi­den’s vic­tory.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump slammed the ban in a state­ment to the me­dia on Fri­day and said he would have a big an­nounce­ment soon, adding that Twit­ter had “gone fur­ther and fur­ther in ban­ning free speech” and was in ca­hoots with the “rad­i­cal left”.</p>
    <p>“Tonight, Twit­ter em­ploy­ees co­or­di­nated with the Democrats and the rad­i­cal left in re­mov­ing my ac­count from their plat­form, to si­lence me – and YOU, the 75,000,000 great pa­tri­ots who voted for me,” said Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>He added that he had been ne­go­ti­at­ing with var­i­ous other sites, with­out nam­ing any, and that he would also look into build­ing his own plat­form in the near fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump had ini­tially posted the state­ment on the of­fi­cial govern­ment ac­count @POTUS, but it was quickly deleted by Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>His son, Mr Don­ald Trump Jr, protested against the ban on his own ac­count, writ­ing: “Free speech no longer ex­ists in Amer­ica.”</p>
    <p>In a state­ment ex­plain­ing its ban, Twit­ter said that two of Mr Trump’s tweets were highly likely to en­cour­age and in­spire people to copy last Wed­nes­day’s vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>It warned that plans for fu­ture armed protests had al­ready be­gun pro­lif­er­at­ing on Twit­ter and off it.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude a pro­posed sec­ondary at­tack on the US Capi­tol and state capi­tol build­ings next Sun­day, three days be­fore Mr Bi­den’s in­au­gu­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>The first of Mr Trump’s of­fend­ing tweets had been posted on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>He wrote: “The 75,000,000 great Amer­i­can Pa­tri­ots who voted for me, Amer­ica First, and Make Amer­ica Great Again, will have a Gi­ant Voice long into the fu­ture. They will not be dis­re­spected or treated un­fairly in any way, shape or form!!!”</p>
    <p>Twit­ter said that the use of the words “Amer­i­can Pa­tri­ots” to de­scribe some of his sup­port­ers was be­ing in­ter­preted as “sup­port for those com­mit­ting vi­o­lent acts at the US Capi­tol”.</p>
    <p>In the sec­ond of­fend­ing tweet, Mr Trump wrote he would not be at­tend­ing Mr Bi­den’s in­au­gu­ra­tion on Jan 20. This state­ment was be­ing re­ceived by a num­ber of his sup­port­ers as fur­ther con­fir­ma­tion that the elec­tion was not le­git­i­mate and a dis­avowal of his pre­vi­ous state­ment that there would be an or­derly tran­si­tion of power, said Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>It “may also serve as en­cour­age­ment to those po­ten­tially con­sid­er­ing vi­o­lent acts that the in­au­gu­ra­tion would be a ‘safe’ tar­get, as he will not be at­tend­ing”, Twit­ter added.</p>
    <p>Social me­dia plat­forms have been grap­pling with how to con­trol the spread of mis­in­for­ma­tion, calls to vi­o­lence and Mr Trump’s re­peated false claims of elec­toral fraud.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, Twit­ter also re­moved the ac­counts of for­mer Trump of­fi­cial Michael Flynn, lawyer Sid­ney Pow­ell and other QAnon con­spir­acy the­o­rists, due to their “po­ten­tial to lead to off­line harm”, a spokesman told US me­dia out­lets.</p>
    <p>YouTube on Fri­day evening re­port­edly re­moved the chan­nel for one-time Trump strate­gist Steve Ban­non’s War Room pod­cast – af­ter Mr Trump’s lawyer Rudy Gi­u­liani ap­peared and blamed the Capi­tol siege on Democrats.</p>
    <p>Face­book and In­sta­gram have also in­def­i­nitely blocked Mr Trump’s ac­counts from post­ing.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, Google banned the Par­ler app, a social me­dia plat­form Trump sup­port­ers fre­quent and used to dis­cuss and plan last Wed­nes­day’s at­tack on the Capi­tol, un­til it comes up with a plan to po­lice egre­gious con­tent.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple has also threat­ened to ban Par­ler from its app store un­less it mod­er­ates its con­tent.</p>
