    <p>Amid the pan­demic, Sin­ga­pore has strength­ened its sta­tus as a global lo­gis­tics hub and sees the sec­tor as one of the bright sparks in its econ­omy go­ing for­ward, said Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing yes­ter­day. It is ex­pected to grow as in­vest­ments flow in, and cre­ate qual­ity jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans, he added.</p>
    <p>In the midst of a global pan­demic that has dis­rupted sup­ply chains, Sin­ga­pore has strength­ened its sta­tus as a global lo­gis­tics hub and sees the sec­tor as one of the bright sparks in its econ­omy go­ing for­ward, said Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The lo­gis­tics sec­tor is ex­pected to grow as in­vest­ments flow in and also cre­ate qual­ity jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans, he added.</p>
    <p>Some parts of the sec­tor were hit hard by the pan­demic, but other seg­ments con­tin­ued to grow and hire work­ers, the Min­istry of Man­power said yes­ter­day in its weekly jobs re­port.</p>
    <p>There are now more than 2,100 op­por­tu­ni­ties for work­ers avail­able in the sec­tor. More than 1,300 of th­ese are jobs, 510 are com­pany-hosted trainee­ships and at­tach­ments, and 290 are train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>About one in three of the 1,300 avail­able jobs is for pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians, with some pay­ing me­dian monthly salaries of be­tween $5,000 and $5,500.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan noted that Sin­ga­pore has en­hanced its rep­u­ta­tion as an in­ter­na­tional hub amid the cri­sis by keep­ing the coun­try open to trade even as global sup­ply chains have been dis­rupted.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore was also helped by the ef­fi­ciency of its op­er­a­tions and the re­li­a­bil­ity of its poli­cies, he added.</p>
    <p>“We have dis­tin­guished our­selves in how we lean for­ward to make sure that the in­tegrity of our sup­ply chains was main­tained. We did not im­pose any ad­di­tional re­stric­tions, we did not im­pose any ex­port con­trols,” said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>But the im­pact of the pan­demic on the lo­gis­tics sec­tor has been un­even, Man­power Mi n i s t e r Josephine Teo noted yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“There were com­pa­nies that were af­fected by the re­duc­tion in air­freight ca­pac­ity, such as those serv­ing hard-hit sec­tors, in­clud­ing avi­a­tion and aero­space,” she said.</p>
    <p>“At the same time, com­pa­nies ser­vic­ing e-com­merce and the health­care sec­tor saw an in­crease in op­er­a­tions ac­tiv­i­ties and re­quire­ments. Th­ese com­pa­nies con­tin­ued to hire and take on board more peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo and Mr Chan were speak­ing to the me­dia af­ter their visit to Ger­man lo­gis­tics firm DB Schenker’s Red Lion fa­cil­ity in Changi.</p>
    <p>The lo­gis­tics sec­tor is a key pil­lar of Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy and con­trib­uted $6.8 bil­lion, or 1.4 per cent, of Sin­ga­pore’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct last year. It em­ploys over 86,000 work­ers across more than 5,300 busi­ness en­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan pointed out that Sin­ga­pore has moved to­wards higher value-added lo­gis­tics ser­vices, such as con­tract lo­gis­tics that pro­vide cus­tomised and end-to-end so­lu­tions for com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Firms in high-value sec­tors such as bio­phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals and in­fo­com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy are at­tracted to Sin­ga­pore, and this can cre­ate more good jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans, he noted.</p>
    <p>Lead­ing global firms such as DHL, UPS and DB Schenker have also made Sin­ga­pore their re­gional head­quar­ters, while Glax­oSmithK­line and Unilever have lo­cated their re­gional sup­ply chain man­age­ment teams here.</p>
    <p>In the next five years, ma­jor lo­gis­tics firms in Sin­ga­pore are plan­ning to cre­ate about 1,500 new jobs in the sec­tor based on in­vest­ment com­mit­ments in 2018 and last year, said Mr Chan. In­vest­ments in dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion will also bring about new ca­pa­bil­i­ties and jobs in dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and au­to­ma­tion within the in­dus­try, he added.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo also al­layed fears that the use of tech­nol­ogy may take jobs away from work­ers.</p>
    <p>“When com­pa­nies use tech­nol­ogy, they can op­er­ate more ef­fi­ciently and at­tract more cus­tomers. This in­creased growth leads to an ex­pan­sion of work­force while chang­ing the qual­i­ta­tive na­ture of their work,” she said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore wi l l con­tinue to strengthen its sta­tus as an in­ter­na­tional busi­ness hub and im­prove its at­trac­tive­ness to global lo­gis­tics play­ers, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the me­dia af­ter a visit to Ger­man lo­gis­tics firm DB Schenker’s Red Lion fa­cil­ity at the Air­port Lo­gis­tics Park in Changi, he out­lined three ways the Re­pub­lic will do so:</p>
    <p>• Sin­ga­pore will en­sure that global lo­gis­tics play­ers con­tinue to plant in­vest­ments and grow op­er­a­tions here to serve both their lo­cal and world­wide op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>• It will also strengthen its net­work of free trade agree­ments to pro­vide more op­por­tu­ni­ties at more com­pet­i­tive prices for lo­gis­tics firms to base their op­er­a­tions here.</p>
    <p>• It is also es­sen­tial for firms to im­prove the ef­fi­cien­cies of their sys­tems and utilise the lat­est tech­nolo­gies to quicken lo­gis­tics pro­cess­ing, Mr Chan said.</p>
    <p>He noted that it is bet­ter to see a rel­a­tively empty ware­house th­ese days rather than one that is at full ca­pac­ity, which was what peo­ple used to be im­pressed with in the past.</p>
    <p>An empty ware­house demon­strates that things are mov­ing through a faster rate, he pointed out. “That is re­ally what we are striv­ing for rather than just to store things,” the min­is­ter added.</p>
    <p>The lo­gis­tics sec­tor is a key pil­lar of Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy and con­trib­uted $6.8 bil­lion, or 1.4 per cent, of Sin­ga­pore’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct last year. It em­ploys over 86,000 work­ers across more than 5,300 busi­ness en­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan high­lighted how Sin­ga­pore’s re­li­a­bil­ity as a lo­gis­tics hub has be­come much more im­por­tant dur­ing this coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“In a Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion where there is a lot of dis­rup­tion to sup­ply chains and a lot of man-made pol­icy-in­duced re­stric­tions to sup­ply chains... Sin­ga­pore’s rep­u­ta­tion as a trusted part­ner be­comes even more im­por­tant,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan also high­lighted how be­yond the ef­fi­ciency and re­li­a­bil­ity of Sin­ga­pore’s poli­cies, the re­silience of its lo­gis­tics net­work also so­lid­i­fies its po­si­tion as a global hub amid the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“To­day, in Sin­ga­pore, if some­one wants to ship some­thing through Sin­ga­pore, and one part of the net­work gets dis­rupted, we can quickly rechan­nel the net­work to another part and still pro­vide that con­ti­nu­ity in ser­vice,” he said.</p>
    <p>Th­ese strengths pro­vide the Re­pub­lic with more op­por­tu­ni­ties for ex­pan­sion in the lo­gis­tics in­dus­try mov­ing for­ward, Mr Chan noted.</p>
    <p>“We are con­fi­dent that this sec­tor will con­tinue to grow and cre­ate many good jobs for our work­ers and cre­ate many good busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties for our part­ners that have cho­sen Sin­ga­pore as their base to ser­vice the rest of the world.”</p>
