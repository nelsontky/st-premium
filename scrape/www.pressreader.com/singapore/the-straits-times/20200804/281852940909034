    <p>COLOMBO • Sri Lankan Pres­i­dent Gotabaya Ra­japaksa hopes to tighten his hold on the nation’s frac­tious pol­i­tics in an elec­tion to­mor­row that could el­e­vate his brother and al­low them to change the Con­sti­tu­tion if they pre­vail.</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­japaksa, who claims credit for con­trol­ling the spread of the coro­n­avirus in the is­land nation, hopes to install his el­der brother and for­mer pres­i­dent – cur­rent care­taker Prime Min­is­ter Mahinda Ra­japaksa – in the post for­mally with an out­right elec­tion vic­tory.</p>
    <p>Vot­ers in the tiny In­dian Ocean nation of 21 mil­lion peo­ple will wear masks, carry their own pens to mark bal­lot pa­pers and main­tain phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing for par­lia­men­tary polling that has twice been post­poned be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic. Votes will be counted on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Sri Lanka has re­ported 2,824 cases of the coro­n­avirus and 11 deaths as of yes­ter­day. The to­tal fig­ures are lower than in neigh­bour­ing South Asian coun­tries, hav­ing been held in check by a strict lock­down since March.</p>
    <p>“We will make it safe for you to vote,” said chief elec­tion com­mis­sioner Mahinda De­shapriya, urg­ing peo­ple to vote with­out fear.</p>
    <p>The Ra­japaksa broth­ers, who built their po­lit­i­cal ca­reers as Sin­halese Bud­dhist na­tion­al­ists, are best known for crush­ing Tamil sep­a­ratists fight­ing for a sep­a­rate home­land for their eth­nic mi­nor­ity. The 26-year civil war ended un­der the el­der Ra­japaksa’s pres­i­dency. Mr Gotabaya Ra­japaksa, who won the pres­i­dency in Novem­ber, is not up for re-elec­tion in the par­lia­men­tary polls.</p>
    <p>Given the sup­port the broth­ers en­joy among the Sin­halese ma­jor­ity, Mahinda is favoured to be­come prime min­is­ter over Mr Sa­jith Pre­madasa, an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>Sri Lanka does not have a tra­di­tion of con­duct­ing po­lit­i­cal opin­ion polls.</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion can­di­date is the son of Mr Ranas­inghe Pre­madasa, who was as­sas­si­nated by a Tamil sui­cide bomber in 1993 when he was pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>The Ra­japak­sas want to re­turn to the pres­i­dency pow­ers that were di­luted by pre­vi­ous gov­ern­ments as part of re­forms to pre­vent abuses of power.</p>
    <p>“The ma­jor­ity com­mu­nity in Sri Lanka have (shown) that they have al­ready de­cided they want the Ra­japak­sas back by vot­ing Gotabaya Ra­japaksa into the pres­i­dency,” said Mr Jayadeva Uyan­goda, an independen­t po­lit­i­cal com­men­ta­tor.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion, he said, is whether they will get a big ma­jor­ity to make sweep­ing changes.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Ra­japaksa has said he can­not im­ple­ment his agenda of eco­nomic growth be­cause of the curbs on his power.</p>
    <p>“It is im­pos­si­ble to make any mean­ing­ful changes and im­ple­ment the agenda that I pre­sented to the peo­ple,” he said last week.</p>
    <p>Restor­ing those pow­ers would re­quire amend­ing the Con­sti­tu­tion which, in turn, re­quires a two-thirds ma­jor­ity i n Par­lia­ment.</p>
