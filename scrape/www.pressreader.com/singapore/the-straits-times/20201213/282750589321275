    <p>NEW YORK • Now is a great time to de­velop a se­ri­ous bud­get­ing habit. The next year might bring changes to your an­nual in­come and you should look at your fi­nances now so that you are pre­pared for them.</p>
    <p>A na­tion can run deficits; house­holds should avoid them. Peo­ple with­out bud­gets are more likely to fall into debt – and anx­i­ety. But search for “how to cre­ate a bud­get” and most re­sults are in­ad­e­quate. Much ad­vice fo­cuses on those with low or no in­comes, ig­nor­ing other bar­ri­ers to bud­get­ing such as un­ex­pected lay­offs and ex­penses. And al­most ev­ery­one un­der­es­ti­mates the re­wards of bud­get­ing.</p>
    <p>Bud­get­ing takes ef­fort and psy­cho­log­i­cal steel. A per­sonal bud­get will not give you im­me­di­ate grat­i­fi­ca­tion. It will not get you more money. But a bud­get will give you power. That is the main pay­off for the te­dious trou­ble of main­tain­ing a bud­get.</p>
    <p>Lots of In­ter­net ap­pli­ca­tions of­fer tips and mo­ti­va­tion (for ex­am­ple, Debt.org and The Bal­ance) but I sug­gest bud­get­ing free-hand. I started my bud­get with a piece of paper, a cup of cof­fee and some op­ti­mism. I even­tu­ally mi­grated it to my own Ex­cel spread­sheet. You may be start­ing with debt hang­ing over your head. Put that debt, along with sav­ings and wealth, to the side. Your bud­get is about cash flow.</p>
    <p>Though most ad­vice says start with in­come cal­cu­la­tions, I say start with the most dif­fi­cult stuff: Cal­cu­late what you want to spend and com­pare it with what you ac­tu­ally spend. The ef­fect is al­most mag­i­cal. If you are over­reach­ing, you will need to change – sug­gest cheaper ac­tiv­i­ties to friends or en­list fam­ily to ex­change cheaper gifts. The point of bud­get­ing is get­ting a fact-based life.</p>
    <p>On lined paper or a spread­sheet, itemise your spend­ing into 17 cat­e­gories and cre­ate two col­umns: what you think you spend each month, and what you ac­tu­ally spend. (For an­nual ex­penses, di­vide by 12.) This should take you 25 min­utes af­ter you gather your records. Here are the 17 cat­e­gories: Hous­ing, in­clud­ing rent or mort­gage and prop­erty tax pay­ments, util­i­ties and home main­te­nance.</p>
    <p>Car ex­penses, in­clud­ing car pay­ments, an­nual re­pairs and gas. In­sur­ance, in­clud­ing home or renters’ in­sur­ance and any an­nual dis­abil­ity and life in­sur­ance pre­mi­ums. (Do not worry about health in­sur­ance if you get it through work; we are go­ing to be look­ing at your post-de­duc­tions pay.)</p>
    <p>Gro­ceries.</p>
    <p>Bare-bones ne­ces­si­ties such as clothes, hair­cuts (leav­ing out any ex­tras like neck mas­sages), med­i­cal co-pays and pre­scrip­tions.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic trans­porta­tion.</p>
    <p>Eat­ing out. Count core costs only, like cheap lunches or take­out.</p>
    <p>• Min­i­mum pay­ments on stu­dent</p>
    <p>loans.</p>
    <p>• Child­care.</p>
    <p>• The 5 per cent of your af­ter-de­duc­tions salary that should go into a liq­uid emer­gency sav­ings ac­count. Emer­gency sav­ings is for truly un­ex­pected costs, such as when a tree falls on your roof. • Es­sen­tial travel to see rel­a­tives. • Es­sen­tial gifts for core peo­ple on birth­days and hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>Ba­sic en­ter­tain­ment, like date nights, fit­ness classes and books. • Spe­cial-oc­ca­sion din­ing out. • Spe­cial travel and va­ca­tions. • Spe­cial gifts for a ma­jor birth­day, a stray wed­ding or a GoFundMe ac­count for a sick co-worker.</p>
    <p>Spe­cial en­ter­tain­ment, such as con­certs and the­atre.</p>
    <p>First note how much you think you spend on each cat­e­gory. Then fig­ure out how much you ac­tu­ally spend by gath­er­ing your bank and credit card state­ments, look­ing for those sneaky auto-pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Now look at the gap be­tween the two cat­e­gories. Say you think you spend US$600 (S$800) a month on gro­ceries but you re­ally spend US$900. Drill down on whether the 30 per cent ex­tra is caused by im­pulse buys. (It prob­a­bly is, be­cause the gro­cery store knows more about mar­ket­ing than you do.) If you spend more on clothes than you re­mem­ber, it is prob­a­bly be­cause you, like most peo­ple, wear only a fifth of your gar­ments.</p>
    <p>Next, cal­cu­late net in­come – that is what you get paid af­ter em­ployer de­duc­tions for things like health in­sur­ance, taxes and re­tire­ment con­tri­bu­tions. (Re­tire­ment sav­ings is a whole other sub­ject, but most ex­perts ad­vise sav­ing at least 10 per cent of your in­come, ei­ther through work or in an in­di­vid­ual re­tire­ment ac­count; for bud­get­ing pur­poses, do not count this 10 per cent as take-home pay.)</p>
    <p>You are spend­ing too much on es­sen­tial ex­penses (items one to 10) if they take up more than half of your take-home pay. As for the fun stuff (items 11 to 17) you know you are spend­ing too much if you are not sav­ing 5 per cent for emer­gen­cies or if you are putting the fun stuff on credit cards and not pay­ing your bal­ance in full ev­ery month.</p>
    <p>Bud­get­ing ev­ery month is te­dious but it gets eas­ier over time, and there is plea­sure in mas­ter­ing your bud­get. The key to suc­cess is mak­ing your bud­get flex­i­ble by adding and sub­tract­ing cat­e­gories as you learn what you need to man­age. But do not change too much, be­cause com­par­ing year to year helps you plan. Bud­get­ing gives you con­trol – some­thing we sorely need in the roller coaster of the pan­demic.</p>
