    <p>Fo­rum con­trib­u­tor Zhang Zhe Xin is to be com­mended for his courage in shar­ing his per­sonal ex­pe­ri­ence dur­ing dif­fi­cult times (Men­tal health: Of­fer­ing a lis­ten­ing ear can go a long way, Nov 12).</p>
    <p>As a men­tal health pro­fes­sional, I ap­pre­ci­ate his point that, of­ten, open­ing up to some­one who is will­ing to lis­ten can bring about a change in feel­ing, think­ing and ac­tions.</p>
    <p>How­ever, lis­ten­ing is an art not nat­u­rally cul­ti­vated in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In our cul­ture where prob­lem-solv­ing is em­pha­sised, of­fer­ing a lis­ten­ing ear can turn into a ses­sion of giv­ing ad­vice.</p>
    <p>In most sit­u­a­tions, such at­tempts at ad­vis­ing and solv­ing some­one’s prob­lem can ac­tu­ally not be help­ful. It is thus of­ten very chal­leng­ing for peo­ple in dis­tress to open up. They may think: “What’s the use? They wouldn’t lis­ten. I know what they would say be­cause they would in­vari­ably pro­vide so­lu­tions.” (This may not be a bad thing if lis­ten­ing rap­port has first been es­tab­lished).</p>
    <p>Will there come a time when peo­ple can lis­ten to oth­ers with­out try­ing to solve their prob­lems?</p>
    <p>For that to hap­pen, we have to learn to re­spect peo­ple’s abil­ity to solve their own prob­lems. Lis­ten­ing en­tails al­low­ing the per­son the op­por­tu­nity to process his own en­tan­gled feel­ings and thoughts.</p>
    <p>That’s hard to hap­pen when those we ask for help (like our par­ents, teach­ers, bosses and the au­thor­i­ties) feel threat­ened by our com­plaints and in­stinc­tively shift blame by de­fend­ing their own ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Cer­tainly, Sin­ga­pore has a tough bat­tle to over­come in en­cour­ag­ing good men­tal health.</p>
