    <p>Aries</p>
    <p>(March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>You are ex­plor­ing fresh ter­ri­tory and you make each new dis­cov­ery more in­ter­est­ing. You should be able to con­vince oth­ers to join you.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus</p>
    <p>(April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Your abil­ity to dis­cern between real trea­sure and fool’s gold is height­ened. Make the most of it. It will not last for­ever.</p>
    <p>Gemini</p>
    <p>(May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>This is the day to take ac­tion. Get busy as soon as the day be­gins, or you may miss out on some new op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Can­cer</p>
    <p>(June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>You may feel self­ish when pre­sented with a big de­ci­sion, but you need to go with your gut. You can apol­o­gise later, if you have to.</p>
    <p>Leo</p>
    <p>(July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Some­thing a friend says drives you in­sane, but not be­cause it is out­ra­geous or stupid. It is petty be­yond be­lief and it gets to you.</p>
    <p>Virgo</p>
    <p>(Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Try some­thing new, es­pe­cially if it feels like a risk. You should try to test your emo­tional lim­its in some new way.</p>
    <p>Libra</p>
    <p>(Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Get in touch with a friend who has been hid­ing or is hard to reach. You may find that your abil­ity to con­nect is greatly en­hanced.</p>
    <p>Scorpio</p>
    <p>(Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Trust your gut, even if it means tak­ing emo­tional risks. You may not get ev­ery­thing you want, but you play the game well.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s</p>
    <p>(Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Your great en­ergy comes pour­ing back. It is a good time for new ad­ven­tures, but you would be just as happy at home with the fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Capri­corn</p>
    <p>(Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Fo­cus your en­ergy on your big­gest plans – what­ever re­ally needs to get done. If you are dis­ci­plined, you can make amaz­ing progress.</p>
    <p>Aquar­ius</p>
    <p>(Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>A new project, job or ro­mance is open­ing new doors for you. There is no rea­son to get flus­tered, though. Keep your eyes are open.</p>
    <p>Pisces</p>
    <p>(Feb 19 - March 20) Some­one thinks he knows bet­ter than you, but he does not. Still, you need to make sure that his ego is un­hurt when the truth comes out.</p>
