    <p>The only fe­male assem­bly mem­ber in a small pop­u­lar hot­spring re­sort town has been ousted, a year af­ter she went pub­lic with al­le­ga­tions that she had been sex­u­ally as­saulted by the town mayor.</p>
    <p>In the case in Kusatsu in Gunma pre­fec­ture, three hours north­west of Tokyo, Ms Shoko Arai, 51, said town mayor Nobu­tada Kuroiwa, 73, “sud­denly pulled me closer, kissed me and pushed me down on the floor” in 2015.</p>
    <p>Mr Kuroiwa de­scribed the al­le­ga­tions as “100 per cent com­plete lie and fabri­ca­tion”, and his sup­port­ers in­sti­gated a pub­lic ref­er­en­dum to ex­pel Ms Arai from the coun­cil. She over­whelm­ingly lost in the vote on Dec 6.</p>
    <p>Ms Arai told re­porters at the For­eign Cor­re­spon­dents’ Club of Ja­pan last Fri­day that Mr Kuroiwa’s smear cam­paigns and at­tempts to dis­credit her amounted to a “pub­lic se­cond rape”.</p>
    <p>She was heck­led by sup­port­ers of Mr Kuroiwa in the assem­bly when he asked her to re­count ex­actly how he had sex­u­ally as­saulted her, bran­dish­ing an en­larged pho­to­graph of his of­fice. She was also asked to re­veal the iden­ti­ties of sev­eral other peo­ple who had told her that they were also vic­tims.</p>
    <p>Mr Kuroiwa has lodged a po­lice re­port and sued Ms Arai for defama­tion, ac­cus­ing her of hav­ing ul­te­rior mo­tives due to a dis­pute over a mu­nic­i­pal mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The case un­der­scores how the odds are stacked against women in male-dom­i­nated Ja­pan. A 2017 gov­ern­ment sur­vey showed that only 4.3 per cent of vic­tims come for­ward, while the global #MeToo move­ment against sex­ual abuse was low-key in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has failed to meet gen­der equal­ity tar­gets of 30 per cent women in pol­i­tics and busi­ness man­age­rial po­si­tions that it had hoped to achieve by this year, shift­ing the goal­posts back by a decade to 2030.</p>
    <p>Just 9.9 per cent of law­mak­ers in the Lower House of Ja­pan’s bi­cam­eral Par­lia­ment are women, plac­ing the coun­try 167th in the world, ac­cord­ing to the In­ter-Par­lia­men­tary Union. Ja­pan is ranked lower than Saudi Ara­bia (114th, with 19.9 per cent women) and North Korea (123rd, with 17.6 per cent women).</p>
    <p>In busi­ness, 11.4 per cent of man­age­rial po­si­tions in pri­vate firms are held by women, and 6.4 per cent in listed com­pa­nies in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>“We of­ten hear the ques­tion of why the #MeToo move­ment has not gained any mo­men­tum in Ja­pan,” Ms Arai said. “This is be­cause in such a male-dom­i­nant so­ci­ety, there is an at­mos­phere which makes it dif­fi­cult for women in weaker po­si­tions to speak up. They are in­stead crushed, and this has been the case for me.”</p>
    <p>Ques­tions have al­ready been asked in lo­cal and in­ter­na­tional me­dia over let­ting due process run its course, given that Mr Kuroiwa has filed a civil com­plaint.</p>
    <p>“Such pro­ceed­ings take a great amount of time,” Mr Kuroiwa told a sep­a­rate news con­fer­ence at the For­eign Cor­re­spon­dents’ Club of Ja­pan on Dec 14.</p>
    <p>“She is pos­ing as a vic­tim but has not gone to the po­lice nor filed any civil com­plaint,” he said, al­leg­ing that Ms Arai’s fail­ure to seek le­gal ac­tion was proof she had faked her claims. “For the past year she has not pro­duced a sin­gle shred of ev­i­dence but has con­tin­ued to dam­age my hon­our and the dig­nity of the town.”</p>
    <p>Ms Arai claimed the al­leged in­ci­dent took place in Jan­uary 2015. She said she ini­tially feared go­ing pub­lic, but felt it was time to do so in an e-book in Novem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Kuroiwa was livid and in­sti­gated her ex­pul­sion from the 12-mem­ber assem­bly a month later. This was over­turned by Gunma pre­fec­ture au­thor­i­ties, which said the dis­missal was il­le­gal and re­in­stated Ms Arai in Au­gust this year.</p>
    <p>This was short-lived, as Mr Kuroiwa and his al­lies spear­headed a pub­lic ref­er­en­dum to oust her this month. Th­ese steps in ret­ri­bu­tion, Ms Arai said, amounted to “an abuse of power to re­move a per­son in­con­ve­nient to him”.</p>
    <p>She al­leged un­fair­ness in the elec­toral process, given that Kusatsu is a small town of 6,211 res­i­dents. “It is also easy to find out who has voted and who has not. It is not an ex­ag­ger­a­tion to say that the en­tire town is un­der sur­veil­lance.”</p>
    <p>Only 2,750 valid bal­lots were cast in the re­call vote, with 2,542 in sup­port of Ms Arai’s ouster and 208 op­pos­ing the move.</p>
    <p>Ms Arai noted that many of the town’s assem­bly mem­bers own ho­tels and ryokan inns that cre­ate jobs for res­i­dents. She asked: “How many peo­ple can refuse to vote ac­cord­ing to the di­rec­tion of their boss?”</p>
    <p>Mr Kuroiwa stressed he does not op­pose hav­ing women assem­bly mem­bers. “The re­call does not mean women are be­ing ex­cluded from the assem­bly... Arai is turn­ing pub­lic opin­ion into a myth about misog­yny,” he said. “Peo­ple of Kusatsu want to see fe­male mem­bers in the assem­bly, and I want to pride my­self for be­ing a gen­tle­man.”</p>
    <p>Ms Arai said she stands by her al­le­ga­tion and will con­tinue to fight for women so that they can be fear­less about speak­ing out.</p>
