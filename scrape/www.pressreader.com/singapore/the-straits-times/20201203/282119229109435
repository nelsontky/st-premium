    <p>The Min­istry of Fi­nance has in­vited Sin­ga­pore­ans to share their views and hopes for the up­com­ing Bud­get, slated to be un­veiled next Fe­bru­ary. They can do so un­til Jan 8 next year, through var­i­ous chan­nels.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment feed­back unit Reach will have vir­tual and phys­i­cal lis­ten­ing points set up at high­traf­fic ar­eas, while the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion and its grassroots or­gan­i­sa­tions will reach out to Sin­ga­pore­ans via vir­tual en­gage­ment plat­forms such as Ask Kopi Kakis #sharey­ourviews.</p>
    <p>De­tails of the phys­i­cal lis­ten­ing points can be found on the Reach Bud­get 2021 mi­crosite, while de­tails about Ask Kopi Kakis can be found at www.go.gov.sg/ sharey­our views 2021</p>
    <p>Themes and ques­tions to be cov­ered in­clude those on the econ­omy, work­force, so­ci­ety and com­mu­nity, a safe and smart na­tion, and en­vi­ron­men­tal sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>ADAPT­ING OUR WAY OF LIFE TO BE A SAFE AND SMART NA­TION</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore evolved and adapted its strat­egy to keep Covid-19 un­der con­trol, and had to step up dig­i­tal adop­tion to en­sure peo­ple re­main con­nected.</p>
    <p>Ques­tions in­clude: How can Sin­ga­pore con­tinue to strengthen links with other coun­tries while pro­tect­ing its peo­ple? And how can the Repub­lic en­cour­age and ac­cel­er­ate dig­i­tal adop­tion?</p>
    <p>EMERG­ING STRONGER AS AN ECON­OMY</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore re­mains in a good po­si­tion to iden­tify and re­spond to new eco­nomic op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Ques­tions in­clude: How can busi­nesses trans­form and thrive in a post-Covid-19 world? And how can a re­silient work­force be built to sup­port the econ­omy?</p>
    <p>EMERG­ING STRONGER AS A WORK­FORCE</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion, and older work­ers, lower-wage work­ers and gig work­ers have been par­tic­u­larly af­fected.</p>
    <p>Ques­tions in­clude: How should the work­force be equipped with the skills to stay rel­e­vant? And how can the Gov­ern­ment, em­ploy­ers and lower-wage work­ers work to­gether to up­lift work­ers’ in­comes in a mean­ing­ful and sus­tain­able way?</p>
    <p>EMERG­ING STRONGER AS A SO­CI­ETY AND COM­MU­NITY</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has posed greater chal­lenges to vul­ner­a­ble groups. At the same time, there has been a deep­ened sense of sol­i­dar­ity and a greater mo­men­tum in giv­ing.</p>
    <p>Ques­tions in­clude: How can stronger part­ner­ships be en­cour­aged across the Gov­ern­ment, busi­nesses and the com­mu­nity to sup­port vul­ner­a­ble groups more ef­fec­tively?</p>
    <p>BUILD­ING A GREEN AND SUS­TAIN­ABLE FU­TURE</p>
    <p>There can be col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween the Gov­ern­ment, com­mu­nity and busi­nesses to make Sin­ga­pore a live­able city, pro­mote the sus­tain­abil­ity agenda, and tackle the ef­fects of cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>Ques­tions in­clude: What are the new ar­eas where the Gov­ern­ment can part­ner busi­nesses and cit­i­zens to im­prove live­abil­ity and pro­mote en­vi­ron­men­tal, re­source, and cli­mate sus­tain­abil­ity?</p>
