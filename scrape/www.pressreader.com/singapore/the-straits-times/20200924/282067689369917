    <p>In the light of the re­cent cases of bus cap­tains be­ing ver­bally abused or phys­i­cally as­saulted by com­muters, NTWU is re­vis­it­ing the idea of in­stalling plas­tic shields to bet­ter pro­tect bus cap­tains – both in terms of virus and as­sault preven­tion.</p>
    <p>A plas­tic shield around the bus driver’s seat could serve a dual pur­pose in the fu­ture as the pan­demic brings about re­newed safety con­cerns, with driv­ers now threat­ened by both the coro­n­avirus and un­ruly com­muters.</p>
    <p>With an in­crease in the num­ber of cases of as­sault of bus driv­ers this year, the National Trans­port Work­ers’ Union (NTWU) is re­vis­it­ing an idea floated two years ago.</p>
    <p>Then, stake­hold­ers, in­clud­ing bus op­er­a­tors, the NTWU and the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA), had tri­alled the use of plas­tic shields as pro­tec­tion for bus driv­ers against as­sault, although this was even­tu­ally scrapped as driv­ers said the screens re­flected light and af­fected driv­ing.</p>
    <p>This year, with bus driv­ers com­ing into con­flict with one or two com­muters who refuse to wear a mask ev­ery day, the prob­lem has come to a head.</p>
    <p>Said NTWU ex­ec­u­tive sec­re­tary Melvin Yong: “In the light of the re­cent cases of bus cap­tains be­ing ver­bally abused or phys­i­cally as­saulted by com­muters, NTWU is re­vis­it­ing the idea of in­stalling plas­tic shields to bet­ter pro­tect bus cap­tains – both in terms of virus and as­sault preven­tion.</p>
    <p>“NTWU will work with LTA and the PTOs (pub­lic trans­port op­er­a­tors) to study the var­i­ous op­tions avail­able, and once there is a good pro­to­type, we will look at scal­ing and im­ple­ment­ing it in the buses.”</p>
    <p>On Sept 15, an SBS Tran­sit bus driver was be­rated and then beaten up for 12 min­utes by a pas­sen­ger who boarded the bus with­out wear­ing a mask.</p>
    <p>The pas­sen­ger, Ja’afally Ab­dul Rahim, 52, has been charged with vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing hurt to the 39-year-old driver. Ja’afally has also been charged over car­ry­ing a knife with a 6cm blade and 6cm han­dle on the bus.</p>
    <p>On SBS Tran­sit’s buses alone, nearly 40 sim­i­lar cases of as­sault have been re­ported this year, with about half of them mask-re­lated.</p>
    <p>This is up from 33 cases in the whole of last year. SBS told The Straits Times that those in­ci­dents were usu­ally fare-re­lated. Some com­muters were also drunk when al­ter­ca­tions oc­curred.</p>
    <p>In July, SBS Tran­sit be­gan tri­alling trans­par­ent pro­tec­tive shields around the driver’s seat on six of its buses, but this was aimed solely at min­imis­ing con­tact and trans­mis­sion of Covid-19 be­tween the driver and com­muters.</p>
    <p>SMRT has also made an ap­pli­ca­tion to LTA to in­stall plas­tic screens on its buses, although it is un­clear if this was prompted by the coro­n­avirus or cases of bus driver abuse.</p>
    <p>NTWU said that its most re­cent ef­forts take into ac­count the 2018 trial fail­ure. This time, it will im­prove or use a dif­fer­ent ma­te­rial for the screens so as to re­duce the glare from the plas­tic shields.</p>
    <p>It will also make sure that bus driv­ers can get in and out of their seat eas­ily to al­low them to help those with phys­i­cal dis­abil­i­ties board the buses.</p>
    <p>Mr Yong said: “While there are op­tions avail­able in the mar­ket, we will need to ex­plore the fea­si­bil­ity of in­stalling these in our ex­ist­ing buses.</p>
    <p>“We want to re­mind com­muters of their re­spon­si­bil­ity to wear a mask in pub­lic ar­eas so as to safe­guard their per­sonal health, as well as the health of other com­muters and front-line work­ers,” he added.</p>
