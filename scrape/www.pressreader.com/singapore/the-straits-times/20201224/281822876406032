    <p>Bri­tain’s pub­lic health ser­vice yes­ter­day urged Prime Min­is­ter Boris Johnson to ex­tend the coun­try’s Brexit tran­si­tion pe­riod or risk push­ing hos­pi­tals al­ready strug­gling with the coro­n­avirus pan­demic “over the edge” in the event of a no-deal de­par­ture from the EU sin­gle mar­ket.</p>
    <p>As Bri­tain strug­gles to con­tain a rapid surge i n Covid-19 cases caused by an ap­par­ently more trans­mis­si­ble vari­ant of the virus, Na­tional Health Ser­vice (NHS) lead­ers said a month’s de­lay would take hos­pi­tals away from “the im­me­di­ate dan­ger zone”.</p>
    <p>They warned Mr Johnson that the “dis­rup­tive changes” posed by a no-deal out­come would hit just as the NHS is “bat­tling the great­est chal­lenge i n its his­tory dur­ing what is tra­di­tion­ally its busiest time of year”.</p>
    <p>“The NHS might not be per­ceived to be on the Brexit ne­go­ti­at­ing ta­ble, but the dis­rup­tion shock­waves from a no-deal out­come could push the NHS’ abil­ity to func­tion over the edge,” the NHS Con­fed­er­a­tion, one of the health ser­vice’s um­brella or­gan­i­sa­tions, said in a let­ter.</p>
    <p>“Given we are days away from the cliff edge, we urge you to ex­tend the tran­si­tion pe­riod by a month, buy­ing the NHS a pre­cious few ex­tra weeks and en­abling the UK to leave the EU af­ter a one-year tran­si­tion pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>Bri­tain for­mally left the Euro­pean Union on Jan 31 af­ter five decades of in­te­gra­tion, but a tran­si­tion pe­riod – dur­ing which it re­mains bound by the bloc’s rules – ends on Dec 31.</p>
    <p>The spread of the new strain of the coro­n­avirus across south­ern</p>
    <p>Eng­land – be­lieved to be up to 70 per cent more trans­mis­si­ble – has forced bor­der clo­sures and threat­ened sup­ply chains just as Lon­don and Brus­sels ap­proach the dead­line to ne­go­ti­ate their fu­ture trade ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>NHS lead­ers said the cur­rent travel chaos could be just a fore­taste of the cri­sis if Bri­tain leaves the EU with­out any trade deal.</p>
    <p>“Should a deal not be reached, the mag­ni­tude and ex­tent of dis­rup­tion will be of a much greater or­der,” the lead­ers warned.</p>
    <p>The NHS faces hav­ing to make ma­jor ad­just­ments in a short times­pan as new rules, guid­ance and in­for­ma­tion will be in­tro­duced from Jan 1 in the event of a no-deal de­par­ture from the EU.</p>
    <p>The over­haul would come amid soar­ing virus cases and a vac­cine roll-out that has just be­gun, while NHS work­ers are ex­hausted and de­pleted, the con­fed­er­a­tion said.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain, which be­gan a mass vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme this month, has seen one of the high­est death tolls from the virus in Europe, with more than 68,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, it reg­is­tered a record 36,804 new in­fec­tions, bring­ing the to­tal to more than 2.1 mil­lion pos­i­tive cases.</p>
    <p>At a press con­fer­ence on Mon­day, Mr Johnson re­fused to con­sider an ex­ten­sion to the tran­si­tion pe­riod.</p>
    <p>A gov­ern­ment spokesman said Bri­tain was ex­plor­ing “ev­ery route to a deal” and added NHS “will thrive af­ter the tran­si­tion pe­riod”.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain and the EU are still locked in a stale­mate over the Brexit trade deal due to se­ri­ous dis­agree­ments about com­pe­ti­tion and fish­ing, a Bri­tish min­is­ter said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Thus far, no deal has been done and both sides have given an ex­haust­ing ar­ray of con­flict­ing sig­nals that indi­cate, var­i­ously, that a deal is im­mi­nent, that talks have far to go and that a dis­or­derly no­trade deal exit could be on the cards.</p>
    <p>“There are still the same se­ri­ous ar­eas of dis­agree­ment whether that’s on fish­eries or the level play­ing field,” Bri­tish Hous­ing Sec­re­tary Robert Jen­rick told Sky News on Tues­day. “But at the mo­ment, there isn’t suf­fi­cient progress. It isn’t a deal that the Prime Min­is­ter feels he can sign us up to.”</p>
