    <p>TOKYO • Mr Yoshi­hide Suga was sworn in by Em­peror Naruhito as Ja­pan’s 99th Prime Min­is­ter yes­ter­day, after he was for­mally elected to the role by the Diet.</p>
    <p>The 71-year-old, a stal­wart in out­go­ing leader Shinzo Abe’s ad­min­is­tra­tion as Chief Cab­i­net Sec­re­tary since De­cem­ber 2012, said at his first news con­fer­ence as Prime Min­is­ter that he will con­tinue with Mr Abe’s poli­cies.</p>
    <p>These in­clude the three ar­rows of Abe­nomics, com­pris­ing fis­cal spend­ing, mon­e­tary eas­ing and struc­tural re­forms.</p>
    <p>On for­eign pol­icy, he stressed that his goals were to strengthen Ja­pan’s se­cu­rity al­liance with the United States while build­ing sta­ble ties with China, as well as to pur­sue Mr Abe’s Free and Open Indo-Pa­cific vi­sion.</p>
    <p>But Mr Suga also por­trayed him­self as a re­formist who will dis­man­tle “vested in­ter­ests, bad prece­dents and siloed sys­tems”.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, he named a Cab­i­net that largely com­prises fa­mil­iar faces to pur­sue these goals.</p>
    <p>Among the eight min­is­ters who re­tained their po­si­tions were Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and Fi­nance Min­is­ter Taro Aso, who turns 80 on Sun­day, For­eign Min­is­ter Toshim­itsu Motegi, 64, and En­vi­ron­ment Min­is­ter Shin­jiro Koizumi, 39.</p>
    <p>The new Cab­i­net has Ja­pan’s first Dig­i­tal Min­is­ter – a role that re­places the for­mer IT Pol­icy Min­is­ter – with Mr Suga hop­ing to stream­line gov­ern­ment pro­cesses and pro­mote ar­eas such as telemedici­ne and on­line learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe’s brother Nobuo Kishi, 61, who has close ties with Taiwan, was named De­fence Min­is­ter. China warned Ja­pan yes­ter­day against “any form of of­fi­cial ex­changes with Taiwan”, which it re­gards as a break­away province.</p>
    <p>Mr Kishi re­places Mr Taro Kono, 57, who is now Ad­min­is­tra­tive Re­form Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga’s in­au­gu­ra­tion drew fe­lic­i­ta­tions from world lead­ers.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said in a let­ter to Mr Suga that his ap­point­ment was a “tes­ta­ment to con­fi­dence in your abil­ity to steer Ja­pan through these dif­fi­cult times”.</p>
    <p>He cited ar­eas such as age­ing and in­fra­struc­ture in third coun­tries as ar­eas where the two coun­tries can work to­gether.</p>
