    <p>Ed­i­tor-at-large Han Fook Kwang’s column serves as a reminder that Sin­ga­pore must in­deed con­tinue to pro­tect the or­di­nary man in the street and en­sure that peo­ple who need jus­tice are able to ac­cess it through the coun­try’s sys­tem (Keep­ing Sin­ga­pore safe from ‘big shots’, Sept 20).</p>
    <p>I hope the Government takes to heart what Mr Lee Kuan Yew once cau­tioned about act­ing “like a big shot” – as quoted in Mr Han’s com­men­tary – and en­sure there will al­ways be some­one within its ranks who is will­ing “to take the pin and poke the bal­loon and break it” when it is nec­es­sary to do so.</p>
    <p>In the light of this ar­ti­cle, I would like to bring up my sis­ter’s case against the com­pany she worked at for 30 years.</p>
    <p>Her ser­vices were ter­mi­nated last year when she was 58 years old.</p>
    <p>The rea­son given was that the com­pany needed to re­struc­ture and cut costs. A few months be­fore she was asked to leave, the com­pany had said she was over­loaded with re­spon­si­bil­i­ties – at the time, she was hold­ing three port­fo­lios. Her job ti­tle and scope were tweaked and she was to train new em­ploy­ees and trans­fer some of her du­ties to them. Though the com­pany was sup­posed to save costs, it re­cruited two younger em­ploy­ees and dis­trib­uted her work­load be­tween them.</p>
    <p>My sis­ter sought help from the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) with the in­ten­tion of rais­ing the is­sue of ageism in the work­place, which goes against the Government’s call for ex­tended em­ploy­ment to pro­mote ac­tive en­gage­ment be­yond re­tire­ment. Also, she was sev­eral years shy of re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>Af­ter 12 months, she fi­nally re­ceived a one-liner from the MOM stat­ing that her rep­re­sen­ta­tion was un­suc­cess­ful as her dis­missal was not found to be “with­out just cause or ex­cuse”. She was told that her only re­course was through a civil case – an oner­ous un­der­tak­ing for some­one who had been out of work for a year.</p>
