    <p>PLENTY OF TIME TO EN­JOY</p>
    <p>We en­cour­age Sin­ga­pore­ans to come down to com­mu­nity cen­tres only if you re­ally need as­sis­tance in per­son, and please don’t rush... be­cause there is plenty of time to en­joy our tourism ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>MR TER­RENCE VOON, di­rec­tor of com­mu­ni­ca­tions and mar­ket­ing ca­pa­bil­ity at the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to pre­vent the stack­ing of Sin­gapo Re­dis­cov­ers Vouch­ers was made so that the tourism vouch­ers could ben­e­fit more busi­nesses, said the Sin­ga­pore Tourism</p>
    <p>Board (STB) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>While many wel­come the scheme, some con­sumers have lamented the $100 vouch­ers can­not be stacked or com­bined with those of their fam­ily and friends within the same re­demp­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Ter­rence Voon, di­rec­tor of com­mu­ni­ca­tions and mar­ket­ing ca­pa­bil­ity at STB, said: “The vouch­ers are meant to sup­port tourism busi­nesses that have been badly af­fected by Covid-19, so we hope that Sin­ga­pore­ans can sup­port as many busi­nesses as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>Per­sonal use of the vouch­ers also helps pre­vent fraud and scams, added Mr Voon dur­ing a pre­view of the voucher re­demp­tion process at Tiong Bahru Com­mu­nity Cen­tre yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans aged 18 and above can redeem the vouch­ers on­line for lo­cal at­trac­tions, ho­tel stays and tours from Dec 1 this year to June 30 next year.</p>
    <p>They can do so through five au­tho­rised book­ing part­ners: Changi</p>
    <p>Rec­om­mends, Glob­alTix, Klook and UOB Travel Plan­ners, Trav­eloka, and Trip.com</p>
    <p>Each voucher comes in de­nom­i­na­tions of $10. Con­sumers can de­cide how many vouch­ers they want to redeem for each pur­chase.</p>
    <p>Start­ing next month, Sin­ga­pore­ans will be able to get help on how to use the vouch­ers at 53 com­mu­nity cen­tres and clubs (CCs) across the is­land, among other places.</p>
    <p>Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers Vouch­ers am­bas­sadors at the CCs will share what the scheme is about and how to use the vouch­ers.</p>
    <p>Other coun­ters – lo­cated at or near th­ese CCs, or at se­lected malls and SingPost lo­ca­tions – will also be run by au­tho­rised book­ing part­ners un­der the voucher scheme.</p>
    <p>The Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion will also pro­vide reg­is­tra­tion or pass­word re­set ser­vices at th­ese CCs for SingPass, which is re­quired in the voucher re­demp­tion process.</p>
    <p>STB’s Mr Voon said: “We en­cour­age Sin­ga­pore­ans to come down to com­mu­nity cen­tres only if you re­ally need as­sis­tance in per­son, and please don’t rush... be­cause there is plenty of time to en­joy our tourism ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>About 10 to 15 se­niors vis­ited the CC yes­ter­day morn­ing to learn how to use the vouch­ers while book­ing at­trac­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee Kwee Sim, 63, learnt the Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers Vouch­ers have to be used dig­i­tally and that he can use his SingPass ac­count to redeem them.</p>
    <p>He said he will ask his fam­ily mem­bers for help to spend the vouch­ers once he has made up his mind what at­trac­tions to go for.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee, a re­tiree who used to work in the ship­ping in­dus­try, said there could be more el­der­lyfriendly tours in­cluded in the at­trac­tions un­der the voucher scheme as many se­niors have prob­lems trav­el­ling.</p>
    <p>The scheme al­ready i ncludes some ini­tia­tives cater­ing to se­niors. For ex­am­ple, Glob­alTix is work­ing with travel agent Ace Tours to or­gan­ise se­nior-friendly Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers Vouch­ers tours that can be booked through the Glob­alTix plat­form.</p>
