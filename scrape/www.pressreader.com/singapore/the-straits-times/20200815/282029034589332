    <p>While he was out on bail for breach­ing Covid-19 mea­sures, a 30-yearold got drunk with his friends in the mid­dle of his shift as a se­cu­rity of­fi­cer, and later shouted pro­fan­i­ties at po­lice of­fi­cers after be­ing taken to hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Ku­maran Roy Ra­jen­dran was sen­tenced to one week in jail and a $4,700 fine for his var­i­ous of­fences.</p>
    <p>The court heard that at about 1.50pm on April 18, Ku­maran went to a mar­ket at Com­mon­wealth Cres­cent with­out a mask, us­ing his shirt to cover his mouth.</p>
    <p>Three SG Clean am­bas­sadors ap­proached him, but he in­sisted that his shirt was suf­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>He then tried to or­der food from a hawker stall but the stall­holder re­fused to serve him.</p>
    <p>Ag­i­tated, he used vul­gar­i­ties on one of the SG Clean am­bas­sadors.</p>
    <p>An­other am­bas­sador then called the po­lice.</p>
    <p>Ku­maran walked di­rectly to the sec­ond am­bas­sador and pushed the 39-year-old man on the shoul­der be­fore leav­ing the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>He was sub­se­quently ar­rested, charged on May 15 with break­ing Covid-19 rules, and re­leased on bail.</p>
    <p>Just nine days later, on May 24, Ku­maran sneaked out for drinks with his friends at 3am, dur­ing his night shift as a se­cu­rity guard at Sci­ence Park Drive.</p>
    <p>Some two hours later, he fell near his se­cu­rity post in a drunken stu­por and paramedics were called. He was taken to National Univer­sity Hospi­tal (NUH).</p>
    <p>When he came to, he be­came ag­i­tated at NUH staff when he could not find his be­long­ings, prompt­ing se­cu­rity of­fi­cers at the hospi­tal to call the po­lice.</p>
    <p>As he reeked of al­co­hol, the po­lice tried to ar­rest him on sus­pi­cion that he had breached liquor con­sump­tion rules. But Ku­maran re­sisted ar­rest and, ow­ing to his large size, it took three po­lice of­fi­cers and two se­cu­rity of­fi­cers to sub­due him and es­cort him to the po­lice car.</p>
    <p>While locked up at the Po­lice Can­ton­ment Com­plex, he hurled ex­ple­tives at po­lice of­fi­cers in Hokkien and English.</p>
    <p>Ku­maran was con­victed of four charges re­lated to breach­ing Covid-19 rules, us­ing crim­i­nal force on the SG Clean am­bas­sador, breach­ing reg­u­la­tions of the pri­vate se­cu­rity in­dus­try and ha­rass­ing po­lice of­fi­cers while they were ex­e­cut­ing their duty. Three other charges were taken into con­sid­er­a­tion dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>In sen­tenc­ing Ku­maran, who was not rep­re­sented, District Judge Jasven­der Kaur ac­knowl­edged the sever­ity of Ku­maran drink­ing on the job. With re­gard to his re­fusal to wear a mask, she said: “(Wear­ing a mask) is not only man­dated but it is in essence a sim­ple act of car­ing for one an­other dur­ing this pan­demic.”</p>
