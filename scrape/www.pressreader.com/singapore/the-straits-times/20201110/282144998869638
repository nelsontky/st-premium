    <p>Law firm Tan Kok Quan Part­ner­ship has been ap­pointed to act for an In­de­pen­dent Panel tasked by Sengkang Town Coun­cil (SKTC) to han­dle mat­ters re­lated to a court ap­peal in­volv­ing Work­ers’ Party (WP) MPs Sylvia Lim and Pritam Singh plus oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments show Ms Ma­rina Chin, joint man­ag­ing part­ner of the firm, was for­mally ap­pointed on Oct 28, the vest­ing date on which the as­sets and li­a­bil­i­ties of Pung­gol East sin­gle-mem­ber con­stituency (SMC) were trans­ferred to SKTC.</p>
    <p>The newly formed SKTC has taken over the man­age­ment of the for­mer Pung­gol East SMC, which used to be un­der Pasir Ris-Pung­gol Town Coun­cil (PRPTC). But fol­low­ing changes to the elec­toral bound­aries for GE2020, Pung­gol East is now in Sengkang GRC.</p>
    <p>SKTC sub­se­quently ap­pointed the In­de­pen­dent Panel to de­cide how it should pro­ceed with the ap­peal.</p>
    <p>The panel – com­pris­ing law pro­fes­sor Kevin Tan, and Se­nior Coun­sel Ken­neth Tan and Lok Vi Ming – has been tasked to han­dle all mat­ters on the pend­ing ap­peals against a High Court judg­ment in­volv­ing PRPTC.</p>
    <p>PRPTC had filed the law­suit to re­cover al­leged losses in­curred by the for­mer Pung­gol East SMC when it was un­der the WP from 2013 to 2015. It ini­ti­ated the civil suit af­ter the WP-run Alju­nied-Hougang Town Coun­cil had taken the same de­fen­dants to court.</p>
    <p>The WP town coun­cil­lors, as well as the PRPTC, have filed an ap­peal against the High Court judg­ment last year which ruled, among other things, that Ms Lim and WP’s then sec­re­tary-gen­eral Low Thia Khi­ang had breached their fidu­ciary du­ties to the town coun­cil. Mr Singh, the WP’s cur­rent sec­re­tary­gen­eral, was found to have breached his duty of skill and care.</p>
    <p>The Supreme Court was no­ti­fied last month about Ms Chin’s ap­point­ment as coun­sel.</p>
    <p>The for­mal ap­point­ment of coun­sel for the In­de­pen­dent Panel in re­la­tion to the ap­peal is un­der­stood to sug­gest that SKTC could suc­ceed PRPTC as the party to con­tinue in the ap­peal, with court ap­proval.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor of Law Ben­jamin Ong said SKTC is “likely” to seek a court or­der to re­place PRPTC as a party to the suit. He added that the court may on its own mo­tion or­der PRPTC to be sub­sti­tuted by SKTC un­der the Rules of Court.</p>
    <p>The hear­ing be­fore a five-mem­ber Court of Ap­peal, com­pris­ing Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon,</p>
    <p>Ap­peal Court judges An­drew Phang, Ju­dith Prakash and Tay Yong Kwang, as well as Jus­tice Woo Bih Li, is due to be heard later this month.</p>
    <p>The PRPTC case is one of three ap­peals sched­uled to be heard.</p>
