    <p>SYD­NEY • China will lose ac­cess to a strate­gic space track­ing sta­tion in West­ern Aus­tralia when its con­tract ex­pires, the fa­cil­ity’s own­ers have said, a de­ci­sion that cuts into Bei­jing’s ex­pand­ing space ex­plo­ration and nav­i­ga­tional ca­pa­bil­i­ties in the Pa­cific re­gion.</p>
    <p>The Swedish Space Cor­po­ra­tion (SSC) has had a con­tract al­low­ing Bei­jing ac­cess to the satel­lite an­tenna at the ground sta­tion since at least 2011. It is lo­cated next to an SSC satel­lite sta­tion pri­mar­ily used by the United States and its agen­cies, in­clud­ing Nasa.</p>
    <p>The Swedish state-owned com­pany told Reuters it would not en­ter into any new con­tracts at the</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian site to sup­port Chi­nese cus­tomers af­ter its cur­rent con­tract ex­pires.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it did not dis­close when the lease runs out.</p>
    <p>“Given the com­plex­ity of the Chi­nese market, brought about by the over­all geopo­lit­i­cal sit­u­a­tion, SSC has de­cided to fo­cus mainly on other mar­kets for the com­ing years,” the SSC said in an e-mailed re­sponse to questions.</p>
    <p>The site is owned by SSC sub­sidiary, SSC Space Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian gov­ern­ment did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to questions yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese foreign min­istry did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a</p>
    <p>Reuters re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>The ex­pan­sion of China’s space ca­pa­bil­i­ties, which in­cludes the grow­ing so­phis­ti­ca­tion of its Bei­dou nav­i­ga­tion net­work, is one of the new fron­tiers of ten­sion be­tween the US and China, which are clash­ing over ev­ery­thing from tech­nol­ogy and trade to Chi­nese ac­tiv­i­ties in the dis­puted South China Sea.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has a strong al­liance with the US, which in­cludes work­ing to­gether on space re­search and pro­grammes, while Canberra’s diplo­matic and trade ties with Bei­jing have also been frac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>China last used the Yatharagga Satel­lite Sta­tion, lo­cated about 350km north of the Aus­tralian city of Perth, in June 2013 to sup­port the three-per­son Shen­zhou 10 mis­sion which com­pleted a se­ries of space dock­ing tests, SSC said.</p>
    <p>The SSC said that the cur­rent con­tract sup­ports Chi­nese sci­en­tific space mis­sions within its pro­gramme for manned space flights for teleme­try, track­ing and com­mand ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Ground sta­tions are a vi­tal part of space pro­grammes given that they cre­ate a telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions link with space­craft.</p>
    <p>While sta­tions have dif­fer­ent ca­pa­bil­i­ties, they can be equipped to co­or­di­nate satel­lites for civil-mil­i­tary Global Nav­i­ga­tion Satel­lite Sys­tems (GNSS) such as Bei­dou, Rus­sia’s Glonass, the Euro­pean Union’s Galileo sys­tem and US-owned Global Po­si­tion­ing Satel­lite (GPS).</p>
    <p>China’s space pro­gramme has been in­creas­ing its ac­cess to over­seas ground sta­tions in re­cent years, in line with the ex­pan­sion of its space ex­plo­ration and nav­i­ga­tional pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>“Gen­er­ally speak­ing, any­where you put a GNSS mon­i­tor­ing ground sta­tion will im­prove the ac­cu­racy of po­si­tion­ing for that re­gion,” said Mr Joon Wayn Cheong, a se­nior re­search as­so­ciate at the Univer­sity of New South Wales’ School of Elec­tri­cal En­gi­neer­ing.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor of space law and pol­icy</p>
    <p>Christophe­r New­man, from Northum­bria Univer­sity in New­cas­tle, Eng­land, said China wants to re­move its de­pen­dence on GPS as part of broader plans to ex­pand its global in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>“GPS could be made un­avail­able to them in a mil­i­tary con­flict. An in­de­pen­dent se­cure sys­tem is cru­cial for the ca­pa­bil­i­ties of the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army in re­spect to tar­get­ing, weapons, nav­i­ga­tion,” Prof New­man told Reuters.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing last year re-es­tab­lished diplo­matic ties with the small Pa­cific is­land na­tion of Kiri­bati, where it has a moth­balled ground sta­tion in the cen­tral Pa­cific Ocean.</p>
