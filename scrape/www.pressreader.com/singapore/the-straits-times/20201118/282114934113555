    <p>The Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Fair and Pro­gres­sive Em­ploy­ment Prac­tices (Tafep) ad­vises em­ploy­ers on fair hir­ing and se­lec­tion prac­tices</p>
    <p>I am cre­at­ing a job ap­pli­ca­tion form for my new com­pany. Are there any best prac­tices to fol­low ?</p>
    <p>Job ap­pli­ca­tion forms are more than just an ad­min­is­tra­tive tool. They help your or­gan­i­sa­tion bet­ter un­der­stand and short­list the most suit­able can­di­dates for em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>It is there­fore im­por­tant to align your job ap­pli­ca­tion form with the re­quire­ments for the job. Ask­ing the ap­pli­cant for in­for­ma­tion that is ir­rel­e­vant to the role can be con­sid­ered dis­crim­i­na­tory and places your com­pany at risk of not abid­ing by the Tri­par­tite Guide­lines on Fair Em­ploy­ment Prac­tices. Here are some steps to guide you:</p>
    <p>Ask can­di­dates for only in­for­ma­tion di­rectly re­lated to the job, such as their em­ploy­ment his­tory and qual­i­fi­ca­tions Re­frain from ask­ing for per­sonal in­for­ma­tion such as age, date of birth, gen­der, race, re­li­gion, mar­i­tal sta­tus and fam­ily re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, and their dis­abil­i­ties Avoid re­quest­ing per­sonal de­tails such as pho­to­graphs and na­tional ser­vice li­a­bil­ity or a dec­la­ra­tion of men­tal health con­di­tions</p>
    <p>If you need to ask for per­sonal in­for­ma­tion be­fore mak­ing a job of­fer, you should ex­plain why the in­for­ma­tion is needed to as­sess the can­di­date’s abil­ity to do the job.</p>
    <p>What other ar­eas of the hir­ing process should I take note of ?</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers should up­hold fair hir­ing prac­tices and hire based on merit. Be­sides re­view­ing your job ap­pli­ca­tion form, it is also im­por­tant to en­sure your job ad­ver­tise­ments are non-dis­crim­i­na­tory and to train your hir­ing man­agers in con­duct­ing job in­ter­views fairly.</p>
    <p>Be clear in your se­lec­tion cri­te­ria</p>
    <p>Re­view your se­lec­tion cri­te­ria in job ad­ver­tise­ments to make sure they are re­lated to the qual­i­fi­ca­tions, skills, knowl­edge and ex­pe­ri­ence of can­di­dates. Be mind­ful of un­con­scious bi­ases and avoid us­ing words or phrases that can come across as dis­crim­i­na­tory, such as stat­ing a pre­ferred na­tion­al­ity, lan­guage, gen­der or age group with­out jus­ti­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Fo­cus on merit dur­ing in­ter­views</p>
    <p>A job in­ter­view should fo­cus on the can­di­date’s job-re­lated skills and ex­pe­ri­ence to as­sess the can­di­date’s suit­abil­ity and like­li­hood of success in the job and in the or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>All hir­ing man­agers should be fa­mil­iar with the Tri­par­tite Guide­lines on Fair Em­ploy­ment Prac­tices and apply the prin­ci­ples set out within to the in­ter­view process.</p>
    <p>Treat every­one with re­spect</p>
    <p>Train your hir­ing man­agers to ex­er­cise tact and sen­si­tiv­ity when in­ter­view­ing in­di­vid­u­als from all back­grounds and de­mo­graph­ics. Com­pany poli­cies and/or prac­tices that may in­volve at­tributes such as age, race or re­li­gion should be care­fully con­veyed, so as not to be mis­con­strued as dis­crim­i­na­tory.</p>
    <p>Stan­dard­ise the in­ter­view process such that each can­di­date for the same role is asked the same set of ques­tions to avoid sub­ject­ing your can­di­dates to un­con­scious bias.</p>
    <p>Does re­mote hir­ing make it harder to prac­tise fair hir­ing?</p>
    <p>Re­mote hir­ing is be­com­ing in­creas­ingly com­mon, as or­gan­i­sa­tions ad­just their hir­ing pro­cesses in re­sponse to more em­ploy­ees and job seek­ers work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>Even so, em­ploy­ers should en­sure their in­ter­view pro­cesses and ques­tions are merit-based and non-dis­crim­i­na­tory. Dur­ing re­mote in­ter­views, there could be tech­no­log­i­cal bar­ri­ers, such as dif­fi­cul­ties in read­ing body lan­guage and mak­ing di­rect eye con­tact, be­tween the in­ter­viewer and can­di­date.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, can­di­dates who are un­fa­mil­iar with the tech­nol­ogy used may not be able to ef­fec­tively re­solve tech­ni­cal er­rors that oc­cur dur­ing the in­ter­view. Such is­sues may dis­ad­van­tage some can­di­dates and ad­versely af­fect the in­ter­view­ing ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Un­der such cir­cum­stances, it is im­por­tant to main­tain a fair hir­ing en­vi­ron­ment and fair­ness in se­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>Some ac­tions that em­ploy­ers can take in­clude:</p>
    <p>Shar­ing in ad­vance any new pro­cesses that the can­di­dates need to ob­serve with re­mote hir­ing</p>
    <p>En­sur­ing all can­di­dates re­ceive com­pre­hen­sive in­struc­tions on how to set up the in­ter­view and pro­vid­ing them am­ple time to do so</p>
    <p>Mak­ing sure ev­ery can­di­date is given the same amount of time and free­dom to demon­strate their knowl­edge, skills and ex­pe­ri­ence</p>
    <p>Ap­ply­ing a con­sis­tent set of se­lec­tion cri­te­ria to all can­di­dates</p>
    <p>Con­duct­ing virtual in­ter­views al­lows the ses­sions to be recorded, but be sure to in­form the can­di­date that you are do­ing so be­fore­hand. All em­ploy­ers are ex­pected to abide by the Tri­par­tite Guide­lines on Fair Em­ploy­ment Prac­tices when in­ter­view­ing, re­gard­less of the mode used.</p>
