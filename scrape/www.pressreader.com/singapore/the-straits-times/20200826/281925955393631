    <p>BER­LIN • Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel de­manded full trans­parency from Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin’s gov­ern­ment af­ter a Ger­man med­i­cal team de­ter­mined that Mr Alexei Navalny, the Rus­sian leader’s most prom­i­nent critic, was likely poi­soned last week.</p>
    <p>“In view of Navalny’s ma­jor role in Rus­sia’s po­lit­i­cal op­po­si­tion, the coun­try’s au­thor­i­ties are ur­gently called upon to fully in­ves­ti­gate this act as a mat­ter of ur­gency – and to do so in a com­pletely trans­par­ent way,” Dr Merkel said in a joint state­ment with her for­eign min­is­ter Heiko Maas. “Those re­spon­si­ble must be i den­ti­fied and brought to jus­tice.”</p>
    <p>The de­mand marks a sharp es­ca­la­tion in ten­sions between the West, led in this case by Dr Merkel’s gov­ern­ment, and the Krem­lin. A United States of­fi­cial warned ear­lier on Monday that con­fir­ma­tion he was poi­soned would turn the case into a ma­jor is­sue.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Union’s diplo­matic chief Josep Bor­rell has called on the Rus­sian au­thor­i­ties to launch an “in­de­pen­dent and trans­par­ent in­ves­ti­ga­tion” into the ap­par­ent poi­son­ing.</p>
    <p>“The Euro­pean Union strongly con­demns what seems to be an at­tempt on Mr Navalny’s life,” said Mr Bor­rell on Monday.</p>
    <p>Two days af­ter Mr Navalny was trans­ferred to the Ger­man cap­i­tal for med­i­cal treat­ment, Ber­lin’s Charite hos­pi­tal said that the anti-cor­rup­tion ac­tivist is in se­ri­ous con­di­tion but there is no acute threat to his life.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he may suf­fer longterm dam­age to his ner­vous sys­tem, ac­cord­ing to the state­ment. Mr Navalny has been in a med­i­cally in­duced coma since last Thurs­day af­ter fall­ing ill, and was evac­u­ated from Rus­sia on Saturday.</p>
    <p>His al­lies blamed Rus­sia’s se­cu­rity ser­vices for the poi­son­ing.</p>
    <p>But Rus­sia yes­ter­day brushed off the call for an in­ves­ti­ga­tion. “If the sub­stance is iden­ti­fied and it’s shown to be a poi­son­ing, that would be ba­sis for an in­ves­ti­ga­tion,” Krem­lin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on a con­fer­ence call. For the mo­ment, he said, it’s up to the Ger­man clinic to de­ter­mine what Mr Navalny was ex­posed to.</p>
    <p>In Ber­lin, doc­tors found ev­i­dence of poi­son­ing through a sub­stance re­lated to cholineste­rase in­hibitors, said Charite.</p>
    <p>The spe­cific sub­stance was not i mme­di­ately known and will re­quire fur­ther test­ing to be iden­ti­fied, the hos­pi­tal said, adding that the pa­tient is be­ing treated with the an­ti­dote at­ropine and his prog­no­sis re­mains un­clear.</p>
