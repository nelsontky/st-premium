    <p>The Na­tional Day Pa­rade (NDP) evening show was a uniquely in­ti­mate, stripped down one, focused on the sto­ries of or­di­nary Sin­ga­pore­ans – from nurses to vol­un­teers to cabin crew – band­ing to­gether to fight the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>And while the fa­mil­iar medium of song and dance brought out the mes­sage of a stronger Sin­ga­pore to­gether, many firsts in last night’s event set it apart from past pa­rades.</p>
    <p>For the first time in 55 years, the usual mass dis­plays and grander themes of na­tion-build­ing and mul­tira­cial­ism took a back seat in a show wo­ven around the on­go­ing coro­n­avirus cri­sis.</p>
    <p>In line with the cri­sis, the large live au­di­ences of the past were also ab­sent. Aside from 150 spec­ta­tors at The Star Per­form­ing Arts Cen­tre, most peo­ple caught the show live from their homes.</p>
    <p>The per­for­mances also took place with strict Covid-19 con­trol mea­sures. Dance rou­tines in­cor­po­rated 1m spac­ing be­tween per­form­ers, who had to take two coro­n­avirus swab tests be­fore cur­tains went up.</p>
    <p>Au­di­ence mem­bers were seated a safe dis­tance apart and were not al­lowed to sing along to the songs.</p>
    <p>But such mea­sures could not dampen the mood, with spir­its soar­ing, in­spired by the pas­sion of the per­form­ers and ev­i­dent in the rous­ing ap­plause that fol­lowed each of the 11 items.</p>
    <p>Those watch­ing from home were not left out ei­ther. At 8.20pm, the na­tion rose for the Pledge Mo­ment, when Sin­ga­pore­ans stood and re­cited the Na­tional Pledge.</p>
    <p>The show cul­mi­nated in the Light Up Mo­ment, when the live au­di­ence was joined by those at home in shin­ing lights us­ing their phones and rais­ing them high for a na­tion­wide dis­play of ap­pre­ci­a­tion for those on the front line fight­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Videos of Sin­ga­pore­ans who stepped up dur­ing the pan­demic, such as the ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of a non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion which do­nated lap­tops to those in need, and a group of moth­ers who came to­gether to sew masks, in­ter­spersed the song and dance num­bers.</p>
    <p>Per­for­mances in­cluded a per­sonal song by singer-song­writer Shazuan Shi­raj, also known as Abangsapau, whose father died sud­denly dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>A spe­cial vir­tual choir made up of thou­sands of Sin­ga­pore­ans singing We Are Sin­ga­pore was also a heart­felt re­minder that the na­tion re­mains united de­spite be­ing sep­a­rated by phys­i­cal dis­tance.</p>
    <p>Safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sador Serene Claire Tay, 38, who was part of the phys­i­cal au­di­ence, said she cried dur­ing the vir­tual choir per­for­mance, adding: “It’s very heart­warm­ing to see that Sin­ga­pore­ans have the re­silience to go through ev­ery­thing.”</p>
    <p>Ms Nur Haidah Mo­hamed Yu­soff, a se­nior pa­tient ser­vice as­so­ci­ate at Tan Tock Seng Hospi­tal, watched the per­for­mance with her father at home and took part in the light-up event.</p>
    <p>Ms Haidah, 37, said: “This year’s NDP cel­e­bra­tion truly shows how we try to carry on with our lives de­spite the ad­ver­sity pre­sented by this pan­demic, in a new nor­mal.”</p>
