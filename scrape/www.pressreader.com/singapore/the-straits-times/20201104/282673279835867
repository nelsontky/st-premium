    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Johnny Depp’s loss in a li­bel bat­tle in Lon­don may be the fi­nal straw in a di­min­ish­ing ca­reer as a ma­jor movie star, but much of the dam­age had al­ready been done, Hol­ly­wood ob­servers said on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Depp, 57, best known as the swag­ger­ing Jack Spar­row in the Pi­rates Of The Caribbean film fran­chise (2003 to 2017), had sued a Bri­tish tabloid that la­belled him a “wife beater” dur­ing his tem­pes­tu­ous re­la­tion­ship with his ex-wife, ac­tress Am­ber Heard, 34.</p>
    <p>Depp had told the court he was never vi­o­lent to­wards his ex-wife and his lawyers de­scribed the rul­ing as “per­verse as it is be­wil­der­ing”, and said it would be ridicu­lous for him not to ap­peal.</p>
    <p>Mr Matthew Bel­loni, for­mer ed­i­to­rial di­rec­tor of the Hol­ly­wood Re­porter, said the sor­did details of the short-lived mar­riage had been aired so of­ten in re­cent years that the Lon­don ver­dict likely had lit­tle im­pact in the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“There is a sense in Hol­ly­wood that Johnny Depp is a tainted brand and his dom­i­nance of the box of­fice in the 2000s has come to an end,” said Mr Bel­loni.</p>
    <p>Depp has of­ten played off­beat char­ac­ters and has an army of fans us­ing so­cial me­dia hash­tags like #Jus­ticeForJoh­n­nyDepp who re­acted an­grily to Mon­day’s ver­dict.</p>
    <p>But in­ci­dents like head butting and scrawl­ing graf­fiti in blood that were re­counted in the July trial were at odds with Depp’s fam­ily-friendly films like the Pi­rates Of The Caribbean and Fan­tas­tic Beasts (2016 to present) fran­chises.</p>
    <p>“I think this is the fi­nal nail in the cof­fin of Johnny Depp’s brand,” said celebrity brand­ing ex­pert Jee­tendr Se­hdev. “The ver­dict does not align with that im­age.”</p>
    <p>Dis­ney, which has been work­ing on a re­boot of the Pi­rates Of The Caribbean fran­chise, did not re­spond to queries about Depp’s fu­ture. Pro­ducer Jerry Bruck­heimer said in a May in­ter­view that it was un­clear what Depp’s role would be in a sixth film.</p>
    <p>Depp’s cast­ing as vil­lain Gellert Grindel­wald in Fan­tas­tic Beasts had al­ready pro­voked con­tro­versy in 2017. But he is on board for a third ap­pear­ance in the Warner Bros fran­chise, which be­gan shoot­ing last month. Warner Bros did not re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Depp is also the face of fash­ion house Dior’s male fra­grances. Dior did not re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment about its fu­ture re­la­tion­ship with the ac­tor.</p>
    <p>Mr Bel­loni said that while Hol­ly­wood stu­dios “are not clam­our­ing to be in the Depp busi­ness any­more”, the ac­tor’s ca­reer was far from over.</p>
    <p>“He’s al­ways go­ing to work if he wants to be­cause he is a tal­ented ac­tor and there will be smaller films that will cast him. If one of those be­came a ma­jor hit, he may be back,” Mr Bel­loni said, re­call­ing the come­back of ac­tor Robert Downey Jr as</p>
    <p>Iron Man eight years after serv­ing a year in prison for drug pos­ses­sion.</p>
    <p>Heard’s Hol­ly­wood pro­file is smaller. She is ex­pected to start pro­duc­tion in the mid­dle of next year on Aqua­man 2, but Mr Se­hdev said pro­duc­ers “would do well to in­crease her role in that movie”.</p>
    <p>“She should ab­so­lutely reap the ben­e­fits of her brav­ery. Sen­ti­ment is chang­ing where we do be­lieve vic­tims and we recog­nise that there is a darker side to Hol­ly­wood,” Mr Se­hdev added, re­fer­ring to the crim­i­nal sex­ual as­sault con­vic­tions of pro­ducer Har­vey We­in­stein and co­me­dian Bill Cosby.</p>
