    <p>As Sin­ga­pore moves into the third phase of its re­open­ing to­day, at­trac­tions such as Gar­dens by the Bay (right) have put in place more mea­sures to ac­com­mo­date more vis­i­tors. At­trac­tions that have ap­plied to raise their ca­pac­ity limit to 65 per cent of their full ca­pac­ity can do so from to­day un­der phase three rules.</p>
    <p>As Sin­ga­pore moves i nto the long-awaited third phase of its re­open­ing to­day, at­trac­tions like Gar­dens by the Bay have put in place more mea­sures to ac­com­mo­date more vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>The na­ture park has in­stalled au­to­mated ther­mal scan­ners at the en­trances to its cooled con­ser­va­to­ries, which will sound an alarm if a vis­i­tor with a high tem­per­a­ture tries to en­ter.</p>
    <p>The en­trances and ex­its of the con­ser­va­to­ries are also equipped with au­to­mated peo­ple coun­ters to mon­i­tor their ca­pac­ity, and ar­eas have been marked out to ac­com­mo­date larger groups.</p>
    <p>At­trac­tions that have ap­plied to raise their ca­pac­ity limit to 65 per cent of their full ca­pac­ity can do so from to­day un­der loos­ened mea­sures for phase three, up from the 50 per cent limit which has been in ef­fect since Sin­ga­pore en­tered phase two on June 19.</p>
    <p>Groups of up to eight peo­ple can now gather so­cially, up from a limit of five, and the ca­pac­ity limit for malls and large stand­alone stores will be in­creased from 10 sq m per per­son to 8 sq m per per­son.</p>
    <p>Also in­creas­ing their ca­pac­ity lim­its are four parks man­aged by Wildlife Re­serves Sin­ga­pore (WRS) – the Sin­ga­pore Zoo, River Sa­fari, Night Sa­fari and Jurong Bird Park.</p>
    <p>WRS said more safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors will be de­ployed at its parks dur­ing phase three, es­pe­cially on peak days.</p>
    <p>On Sen­tosa, the Siloso Beach Party an­nual New Year’s Eve count­down will not be held this year, but a spokesman for Sen­tosa said vis­i­tors to the is­land’s beaches, eater­ies and other at­trac­tions can make reser­va­tions for groups of up to eight from to­day.</p>
    <p>In line with cur­rent mea­sures, beach­go­ers will have to book time slots if they in­tend to visit on week­ends and pub­lic hol­i­days, but those who are pa­tro­n­is­ing only food and bev­er­age out­lets at the beach will not have to do so.</p>
    <p>At The Prive Group’s restau­rants, its chair­man Yuan Oeij said, changes to their lay­outs will be made if nec­es­sary, to ac­com­mo­date larger groups of din­ers.</p>
    <p>Given that phase three be­gins amid the fes­tive sea­son, Mr Oeij said Prive’s restau­rants have seen “a flood of re­quests for book­ings, es­pe­cially larger ta­bles”. The group’s Chi­nese restau­rant, Em­press, has also seen an in­crease in book­ings for large ta­bles in an­tic­i­pa­tion of Chi­nese New Year.</p>
    <p>Mr Oeij said that with the rules be­ing re­laxed, he an­tic­i­pates “there will be even more pres­sure from a mi­nor­ity of cus­tomers who do not un­der­stand safe dis­tanc­ing suf­fi­ciently and want op­er­a­tors to break the rules”, some­thing that has been a bug­bear for restau­rants since phase two be­gan and din­ing out was al­lowed again.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Frasers Prop­erty Re­tail, which man­ages malls like The Cen­tre­point, Causeway Point and Cen­tury Square, said more en­try and exit points have been opened to en­sure smooth traf­fic in and around the malls, and ex­ist­ing hy­giene and safe man­age­ment mea­sures will con­tinue to be ob­served.</p>
    <p>With the re­lax­ation of rules, in­fec­tious diseases spe­cial­ist Leong Hoe Nam warned that there will likely be more com­mu­nity cases as larger so­cial gath­er­ings oc­cur.</p>
    <p>Places like South Korea, Tai­wan and Hong Kong showed “ex­em­plary con­duct in their first­wave con­trol” but had to in­sti­tute painful lock­downs when in­fec­tions surged as they loos­ened re­stric­tions, a sit­u­a­tion that Sin­ga­pore would want to avoid.</p>
    <p>“As we go into phase three, we must re­mem­ber the bat­tle scars of the cir­cuit breaker,” Dr Leong added.</p>
