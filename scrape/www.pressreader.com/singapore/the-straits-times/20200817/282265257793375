    <p>Aramaayo, the “fresh­est” of the 16 con­tenders with only six Kranji starts but who came with top cre­den­tials from Aus­tralia, landed Sin­ga­pore’s mar­quee event – the $1 mil­lion Kranji Mile – in a thriller yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It was a gem of a ride by jockey Ruan Maia on the best fan­cied of the three Shane Baertschig­er-trained run­ners in the 1,600m fea­ture de­layed by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Brazil­ian gave his $33 shot, who was don­ning blink­ers for the first time, a beau­ti­ful pas­sage to beat trainer Michael Cle­ments’ classy pair of Top Knight and the much-vaunted $11 favourite Countof­mon­te­cristo in an ex­cit­ing fin­ish. The mar­gins were half a length and a short head.</p>
    <p>Owned by Aramco Stable, Aramaayo clocked a swift 1min 33.85sec for the 1,600m trip. This was just 0.24sec out­side Su­per Nine­ty­seven’s 2013 record. He did it with 57kg to 51.5kg by Su­per Nine­ty­seven.</p>
    <p>Baertschig­er was qui­etly con­fi­dent of a big run from his Aus­tralian Group 3 Spring Stakes win­ner over 1,600m. His one-time Kranji win­ner over 1,400m also ran well in his lead-up races, in­clud­ing a fast-fin­ish­ing third to Siam Blue Vanda in the Group 2 Stew­ards’ Cup over 1,600m on March 20.</p>
    <p>“Well, he was a proven per­former in Aus­tralia at Group level, and he has beaten Top Knight at his third start at Kranji,” said Baertschig­er.</p>
    <p>“In the sec­ond leg of the FourYear-Old Se­ries, he missed the start by six lengths and he ran third.</p>
    <p>“Then his first-up last start the other day was su­per. He came from last to fin­ish third over 1,100m, and we knew he wanted blink­ers, but we saved it for the big one to­day. It helped.”</p>
    <p>The win gave Baertschig­er his third Group 1 suc­cess, after Aramco in the Lion City Cup and I’m In­cred­i­ble in the Queen El­iz­a­beth II Cup, both last year. I’m In­cred­i­ble, who went on to cap­ture the Horse of the Year ti­tle, ran 13th yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Baer­stchiger’s other run­ner, Pred­i­tor, fin­ished ninth.</p>
    <p>The Kranji Mile field jumped evenly and Maia tucked Aramaayo mid­field as in­structed, as the Ja­son Lim-trained $388 out­sider Eye Guy set a brisk pace.</p>
    <p>Jockey Louis-Philippe Beuzelin made the first move on Countof­mon­te­cristo, im­prov­ing from fifth to hit the front shortly after straight­en­ing.</p>
    <p>Maia moved up in tan­dem and came within strik­ing range. He poked ahead 150m out with a force­ful drive. Top Knight charged home on the out­side un­der top ap­pren­tice jockey Si­mon Kok, but Maia kept his mount go­ing to win.</p>
    <p>“It all went to plan. I told Maia yes­ter­day ‘I will scare now, you’re gonna sit mid­field and, hope­fully, you are fol­low­ing Countof­mon­te­cristo, and just save him up for the last crack’ – and it all worked out.</p>
    <p>“I was a lit­tle wor­ried when Top Knight came, but Maia changed his stick to the left and he went on again.”</p>
    <p>Aramaayo is now headed for the $500,000 Group 1 Sin­ga­pore Derby on Sept 6.</p>
    <p>Baertschig­er said the 1,800m trip will not pose any prob­lem as Aramaayo has raced in the VRC Derby and AJC Derby, both over 2,500m.</p>
    <p>The Kranji Mile was the first fea­ture race to be run be­hind closed doors due to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Ini­tially sched­uled for May 23 as an In­ter­na­tional Group 3 in­vi­ta­tion event worth $1.5 mil­lion, it was post­poned to yes­ter­day and down­graded to a do­mes­tic Group 1 $1 mil­lion race. It was also re­stricted to Sin­ga­pore horses.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong raider South­ern Leg­end won the last two years and trainer Cas­par Fownes had planned to re­turn but said he un­der­stood the rea­son hav­ing to miss out on the chance of a “three-peat” feat.</p>
