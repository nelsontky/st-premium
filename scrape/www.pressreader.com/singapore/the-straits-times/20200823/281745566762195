    <p>Fuller­ton Road to­wards St An­drew’s Road</p>
    <p>(be­tween Es­planade Drive and the Vic­to­ria Theatre and Concert Hall)</p>
    <p>Road clo­sure</p>
    <p>Aug 24 (12.01am to 11.59pm)</p>
    <p>• Old Par­lia­ment Lane • Em­press Place do not have is­sues with some histri­on­ics and the argy-bargy of bi­par­ti­san pol­i­tics so long as sub­stan­tive de­bate takes place. And so long as it makes for bet­ter out­comes for Sin­ga­pore­ans and Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>He thanked Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong for propos­ing him as Speaker in the new term, adding that he looked for­ward to con­tin­u­ing as an im­par­tial, neu­tral and ob­jec­tive fa­cil­i­ta­tor of the pro­ceed­ings and de­bates if re-elected.</p>
    <p>The 14th term of Par­lia­ment will open to­mor­row with 93 elected MPs be­ing sworn in, fol­lowed by Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob’s ad­dress, which will out­line the pri­or­i­ties and poli­cies for the years ahead.</p>
    <p>This marks the start of the Gov­ern­ment’s new term after the gen­eral elec­tion on July 10.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that Par­lia­ment has had to ad­just its cus­tom­ary way of do­ing things due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, Mr Tan said pre­cau­tions will con­tinue to be taken, such as keep­ing MPs seated apart.</p>
    <p>The pro­ceed­ings for the re­open­ing will be held across two lo­ca­tions – Par­lia­ment House and The Arts House, which is the old Par­lia­ment House.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said the old main Ta­ble of the House, which dates back to 1955, was brought back for use in the old Par­lia­ment House, which had not hosted a Par­lia­ment ses­sion since 1999, when Par­lia­ment shifted to its cur­rent lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Point­ing to the rich history of the old build­ing in a Face­book post on Fri­day, he said: “Even as we rem­i­nisce and re­call the past, we... need to re­mem­ber that we are also cre­at­ing history for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions as we deal with the is­sues of the day and seek to man­age the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“Let us make sure that our fu­ture Sin­ga­pore­ans think of us with fond­ness and pride!”</p>
