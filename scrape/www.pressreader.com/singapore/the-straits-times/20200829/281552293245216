    <p>The Mini Elec­tric, the Bri­tish mar­que’s first elec­tri­cally pow­ered model, has all the at­tributes of the Mini 3-Door range of cars: good looks, short wheel­base, low cen­tre of grav­ity and famed go-kart-like han­dling. But the elec­tric ver­sion raises the bar with its de­sign, per­for­mance and re­fine­ment. It is the front run­ner for a get­away car be­cause though it may not be the fastest Mini, the silent rocket is the stealth­i­est one in the flock.</p>
    <p>In the 2003 movie The Ital­ian Job, Hol­ly­wood stars Mark Wahlberg, Ja­son Statham and Char­l­ize Theron used the Mini Cooper S as get­away cars af­ter their heist.</p>
    <p>If the film has a se­quel, they will likely be driv­ing the Mini Elec­tric.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish mar­que’s first elec­tri­cally pow­ered model has all the at­tributes of the Mini 3-Door range of cars: good looks, short wheel­base, low cen­tre of grav­ity and famed gokart-like han­dling.</p>
    <p>But the elec­tric ver­sion raises the bar in three ways.</p>
    <p>One, the de­sign.</p>
    <p>The Mini is one of those car brands that can be said to have “good genes”. What­ever form a Mini takes – even the up­sized Coun­try­man – it re­mains dis­tinc­tive.</p>
    <p>If the Mini 3-Door is adorable, the Elec­tric is even more dis­arm­ingly so. There are sim­ple touches that make it stand out from its sta­ble­mates.</p>
    <p>The most vis­i­ble new de­sign de­tail is the Mini Elec­tric logo, which looks like the let­ter E and a two-pin plug.</p>
    <p>The badge is pinned on var­i­ous parts of the car – from the front grille to the tail­gate – in­clud­ing an em­bossed ver­sion on the fuel cap.</p>
    <p>It re­minds me of a boy scout earn­ing badges, and this one says the Mini Elec­tric has un­locked a new achieve­ment level.</p>
    <p>The car also has a funky 17-inch al­loy wheel de­sign that looks like a three-point power socket, which is fit­ting for its tailpipe-less elec­tric power train.</p>
    <p>The body of the Mini Elec­tric is 18mm taller than its 3-Door sib­lings with con­ven­tional en­gines. This is to cre­ate enough ground clear­ance space for its bat­tery in the car’s floor.</p>
    <p>The bat­tery adds a stag­ger­ing 150kg to the car, mak­ing it as heavy as the big­ger Mini 5-Door.</p>
    <p>Con­ven­tional wis­dom says a heavy and higher-rid­ing car will sap the fun out of driv­ing, and this is where the Mini Elec­tric packs a sec­ond sur­prise – its per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>The test car came with a Cooper S badge at the tail­gate. It even has the Cooper S’ signature bon­net bump and air scoop.</p>
    <p>I was baf­fled. Isn’t this a Mini Elec­tric? If there is a Cooper S vari­ant of the elec­tric car, does it mean there will also be Cooper and One ver­sions with lower power out­put?</p>
    <p>Ap­par­ently not. There is only one ver­sion of the Mini Elec­tric, which matches the per­for­mance of the Cooper S and is badged as such.</p>
    <p>Like the Cooper S, the Mini Elec­tric is ex­tremely en­gag­ing to drive.</p>
    <p>But un­like the Cooper S which has its weight front­loaded with the en­gine un­der the bon­net, the Mini Elec­tric’s bat­tery is mounted be­low the seats in the floor. This pins down the car and spreads the weight evenly through­out.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre of grav­ity is low­ered and this gives the Mini Elec­tric an un­matched agility to nav­i­gate around bends and cor­ners.</p>
    <p>On pa­per, the Mini Elec­tric is 0.6 sec­onds slower than the Cooper S (7.3 ver­sus 6.7 sec­onds) and has a lower top speed (150kmh ver­sus 235kmh). In daily drive, th­ese dif­fer­ences are less sig­nif­i­cant.</p>
    <p>The third area where the Mini Elec­tric moves the nee­dle is in its re­fine­ment.</p>
    <p>The more high-pow­ered Mini vari­ants – the S and John Cooper Works ones – have a bit of a raw vibe that is con­sis­tent with their sporty na­ture.</p>
    <p>The Mini Elec­tric, how­ever, takes the re­fine­ment of Mini cars to a new level.</p>
    <p>The ab­sence of a com­bus­tion en­gine means fewer mov­ing parts and the car has a Zen-like calm­ness on the move.</p>
    <p>I was caught in week­day evening rush-hour traf­fic on the CTE and the Mini Elec­tric’s un­hur­ried and smooth ride soothed my nerves.</p>
    <p>Over a three-day, 153km test­drive, the car recorded a power con­sump­tion of 14.2kWh/100km, which is close to the of­fi­cial fig­ure of 14.8kWh/100km.</p>
    <p>The car is not with­out nig­gles. I had range anx­i­ety, fear­ing the car will run out of power be­fore I could recharge.</p>
    <p>The test car shows a range of 200km on a full bat­tery, which I can eas­ily clock in a day. I live in a Hous­ing Board es­tate where there is no con­ve­nient ac­cess to a pub­lic charger.</p>
    <p>Such a limited range is un­com­mon as other elec­tric cars cur­rently on sale here, such as the Hyundai Ioniq Elec­tric and Re­nault Zoe, can clock more than 300km on a sin­gle charge.</p>
    <p>I also can­not de­cide whether the Mini Elec­tric is a sporty or green car. It is a hot hatch, but runs on green tyres – Pirelli Cin­tu­rato P7 run flats – which im­prove mileage.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the Mini oc­cu­pies a unique spot in the sta­ble. It is un­mis­tak­ably a Mini in­side and out­side.</p>
    <p>In the cock­pit, I found my­self star­ing at the char­ac­ter­is­tic cir­cu­lar in­stru­ment clus­ter, which has been digi­tised and dis­plays speed and bat­tery charge level.</p>
    <p>The cabin is pep­pered with dis­tinc­tively Mini fea­tures – round in­fo­tain­ment con­sole, round door han­dles and side air-con­di­tion­ing vents.</p>
    <p>The Mini Elec­tric is priced so close to the Cooper S – at just $4,000 more – that it may snatch buy­ers away from its sib­ling, es­pe­cially those who live in landed homes or con­do­minium es­tates with charg­ing points. The price in­cludes the in­stal­la­tion of a wall charger.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with other elec­tric cars avail­able here, the Mini Elec­tric is also a bit of a steal. It costs only about $3,000 more than the Hyundai Ioniq Elec­tric and a stag­ger­ing $26,000 less than the Kia Niro EV.</p>
    <p>While it may not have four doors or is less spa­cious than th­ese cars, driv­ers who do not need the space are likely to pick the Mini.</p>
    <p>Back to Hol­ly­wood. The Mini Elec­tric is the front run­ner for a get­away car be­cause while it may not be the fastest Mini, the silent rocket is the stealth­i­est one in the flock.</p>
