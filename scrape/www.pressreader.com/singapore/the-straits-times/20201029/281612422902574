    <p>El­i­gi­ble for­eign work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries will be al­lowed to visit re­cre­ation cen­tres on their rest days at stag­gered times from Saturday to buy ne­ces­si­ties, get a hair­cut and re­mit money home.</p>
    <p>These cen­tres also have food and bev­er­age out­lets, mini-marts and com­mu­nal fa­cil­i­ties. Work­ers can visit only a cen­tre that has been as­signed to their dorms.</p>
    <p>There are eight such re­cre­ation cen­tres – in lo­ca­tions like Kranji, Tuas, Wood­lands and Kaki Bukit – that have been built over the years to serve dorm res­i­dents. On av­er­age, each cen­tre can ac­com­mo­date about 300 dorm res­i­dents with safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures in place to limit the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Seven cen­tres are op­er­at­ing, and the eighth will soon be oper­a­tional, said the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The re­cre­ation cen­tre vis­its are part of mea­sures to ease re­stric­tions for mi­grant work­ers safely within and out­side dorms.</p>
    <p>This comes af­ter a two-month trial run since Aug 24 that al­lowed se­lected healthy res­i­dents from cleared dorms to visit the cen­tres on their rest days.</p>
    <p>The low in­fec­tion rates in the com­mu­nity and dorms over a pe­riod of time also played a part in this de­ci­sion, said MOM.</p>
    <p>To be el­i­gi­ble to visit the cen­tres, work­ers must have re­cov­ered from Covid-19 and have im­mu­nity from the dis­ease, or have tested neg­a­tive re­cently un­der the Gov­ern­ment’s ros­tered rou­tine test­ing regime.</p>
    <p>Dorm res­i­dents have to ap­ply – up to seven days in ad­vance – for an exit pass via the SGWorkPass mo­bile app to visit their dorm’s as­signed re­cre­ation cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The dorm that the work­ers are stay­ing in must not have any ac­tive Covid-19 cases. Work­ers must also down­load and ac­ti­vate their TraceTo­gether app at all times.</p>
    <p>There are four stag­gered three­hour time slots be­tween 8am and 8pm for for­eign work­ers to visit the cen­tres on their rest days.</p>
    <p>A fifth time slot from 8pm to 11pm will be added from Nov 2, af­ter feed­back that some work­ers pre­fer to visit af­ter their work­ing hours.</p>
    <p>The rest days for for­eign work­ers in the con­struc­tion, marine and process sec­tors have also been stag­gered af­ter MOM worked with sec­tor agen­cies and em­ploy­ers on this.</p>
    <p>For many mi­grant work­ers, vis­it­ing the re­cre­ation cen­tres will mark their first time step­ping out of their dorms since March.</p>
    <p>Sui­cides and at­tempted sui­cides re­ported by the me­dia and doc­u­mented in videos shared on­line have re­newed con­cerns over the men­tal and emo­tional health of work­ers, many of whom have spent months con­fined to their liv­ing quar­ters.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Christo­pher Koh, di­rec­tor of oc­cu­pa­tional safety and health unit of MOM’s work­place pol­icy and strat­egy di­vi­sion, said the re­cre­ation cen­tre vis­its are “im­por­tant for the men­tal well-be­ing of our work­ers and to re­store a sense of nor­malcy to their lives”.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the Tuas South Re­cre­ation Cen­tre where jour­nal­ists were given a tour, he said stag­ger­ing work­ers’ vis­its to the cen­tres helps to spread out the visitor load at the cen­tres, which have a lim­ited ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>For Bangladesh­i me­chan­i­cal en­gi­neer Sonjon Ku­mar Dey, 36, yes­ter­day’s visit to Tuas South Re­cre­ation Cen­tre was a much-awaited one, as he has been cooped up in his dorm room since March.</p>
    <p>He said: “We had a tough life the past eight months in the dorm. There was men­tal pres­sure (at the time) but here, we can re­fresh our minds and eat and talk to friends.”</p>
