    <p>Fifth-gen­er­a­tion (5G) net­work, per­sonal com­put­ing and wear­able tech­nolo­gies were the most prom­i­nent tech­nolo­gies at the In­ter­na­tionale Funkausste­l­lung (IFA) tech show l ast week i n Berlin, Ger­many.</p>
    <p>An un­usual show for­mat this year due to the Covid-19 pan­demic did not dampen this an­nual tech bell­wether for the hol­i­day sea­son, as about 1,500 ven­dors took part in its hy­brid dig­i­tal and phys­i­cal events from last Thurs­day to Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Loo Wee Teck, head of con­sumer elec­tron­ics at market re­search firm Euromon­i­tor In­ter­na­tional, says: “8K (TVs), 5G, wear­ables and IoT (In­ter­net of Things) will con­tinue to hog the lime­light, as th­ese tech­nolo­gies are still in their in­fancy.”</p>
    <p>Chip­maker Qual­comm an­nounced plans to ac­cel­er­ate 5G global com­mer­cial­i­sa­tion by ex­pand­ing its port­fo­lio of 5G mo­bile plat­forms to its en­try-level Snap­dragon 4-se­ries chip early next year.</p>
    <p>This is ex­pected to speed up the pro­lif­er­a­tion of en­try-level 5G mo­bile smart­phones to re­gions with po­ten­tially 3.5 bil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Mr Bryan Ma, market re­search firm IDC’s vice-pres­i­dent of de­vices re­search, says Qual­comm’s move will help ramp up 5G adop­tion in the next year.</p>
    <p>He says: “Most of th­ese ag­gres­sive moves will be in China. But ei­ther way, 5G isn’t go­ing to be lim­ited to flag­ship phones and will rapidly trickle down to more af­ford­able mid-range and even low-end phones in the com­ing year.”</p>
    <p>Qual­comm also launched the Snap­dragon 8cx Gen 2 5G chip, which al­lows lap­tops to be equipped with fast 5G cel­lu­lar and Wi-Fi con­nec­tiv­ity, as well as ar­ti­fi­cial-in­tel­li­gence ac­cel­er­a­tion and en­ter­prise-grade se­cu­rity. Acer will be the first to in­cor­po­rate the new chip into its lap­top line-up.</p>
    <p>“The PC an­nounce­ments are timely con­sid­er­ing how the pan­demic is driv­ing stay-at-home de­mand,” says Mr Ma.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has made IT prod­ucts pop­u­lar as con­sumers are hav­ing to stay home to work and study.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to market re­search firm GfK, the global IT re­tail market, which in­cludes com­put­ers, lap­tops and tablets, posted an in­crease in sales of 16.7 per cent in the first half of this year from the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Ms So­hjin Baek, GfK’s ex­pert for the IT in­dus­try, says: “Pre­vi­ously, it was nat­u­ral that home, of­fice and school were sep­a­rate places where an in­di­vid­ual be­haves in dif­fer­ent so­cial roles. Now, all th­ese ac­tiv­i­ties can hap­pen at home.”</p>
    <p>“This tran­si­tion from phys­i­cal mo­bil­ity to vir­tual con­nec­tiv­ity sig­nif­i­cantly ex­panded the pen­e­tra­tion of IT equip­ment in the house­hold more pow­er­fully than any mar­ket­ing cam­paign could do. As a re­sult, equip­ping one­self with an IT de­vice has be­come as com­mon as own­ing a smart­phone,” she says.</p>
    <p>It is no won­der then that PC mak­ers Len­ovo and Asus and even smart­phone maker Honor all un­veiled new lap­tops at this year’s IFA.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese tech com­pa­nies Honor and TCL in­tro­duced their lat­est wear­ables at this year’s event too.</p>
    <p>Honor launched a rugged smart­watch that caters to ad­ven­tur­ers. But TCL de­cided to go for the el­derly market with its MoveTime Fam­ily Watch MT43A smart­watch that has auto fall de­tec­tion and hands-free, two-way call­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Loo says: “Mov­ing for­ward, we’ll see more prod­ucts de­signed to cater to the el­derly, who en­joy high dis­pos­able in­come.”</p>
    <p>This year’s IFA also had a piece of news that would be im­por­tant for gamers, es­pe­cially given the ex­pected launch of the PlayS­ta­tion 5 and Xbox Se­ries X next-gen­er­a­tion game con­soles from Sony and Mi­crosoft, re­spec­tively, at the end of the year.</p>
    <p>LG an­nounced that its 2020 8K Oled TV will sup­port Nvidia’s new RTX 30 se­ries graph­ics pro­cess­ing unit, mak­ing its TVs an at­trac­tive choice for gamers. Sam­sung, which was not present at IFA, also an­nounced a new 8K TV last week.</p>
    <p>Mr Alexan­der Dehmel, GfK’s market in­sights lead for Asia Pa­cific, says: “The 8K TV is still a niche market tar­get­ing the high-end seg­ment. How­ever, with the avail­abil­ity of more mod­els of­fered by an in­creas­ing num­ber of brands, we ex­pect prices to be com­ing down in the com­ing months.”</p>
    <p>This year’s event is also a sig­nal that “tech is back” and the re­cov­ery and re­build­ing of the in­dus­try starts now, says Mr Jens Hei­thecker, IFA or­gan­iser’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts and ven­dors lauded the hy­brid na­ture of IFA, as op­posed to be­ing a dig­i­tal-only event like many that have taken place this year, such as Ap­ple’s World­wide De­vel­oper Con­fer­ence in June as well as Gamescom and Sam­sung’s Un­packed event – both held last month.</p>
    <p>Among the 1,500 ven­dors that took part in this year’s IFA, 150 were in Berlin for phys­i­cal events, with the rest par­tic­i­pat­ing vir­tu­ally. Some com­pa­nies such as LG Elec­tron­ics had a phys­i­cal press con­fer­ence, but a vir­tual show­room.</p>
    <p>Mr Ken Hong, LG Elec­tron­ics’ se­nior di­rec­tor of global cor­po­rate com­mu­ni­ca­tions, says: “The op­por­tu­nity to com­mu­ni­cate our mes­sage in front of the at­ten­dees that IFA had in­vited, with a min­i­mum num­ber of LG em­ploy­ees on site, was some­thing we felt was worth try­ing.”</p>
    <p>This year’s show saw 6,100 at­ten­dees, a huge drop from the crowd of 245,000 last year.</p>
    <p>Still, the hy­brid event could be a model for other up­com­ing tech events in the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Ma feels this hy­brid set-up at least tries to sal­vage the value of what re­mains of the phys­i­cal event.</p>
    <p>He says: “Af­ter all, one of the big­gest ben­e­fits of con­fer­ences is the in-per­son re­la­tion­ship build­ing, deal-mak­ing and even spon­ta­neous en­coun­ters, and that’s not some­thing that’s easy to repli­cate on­line.”</p>
    <p>Mr Loo says: “Deals are inked dur­ing th­ese events and re­la­tion­ship fos­tered. It is dif­fi­cult to repli­cate the adren­a­line and in­ter­ac­tion of face-to-face meet­ings.”</p>
    <p>Har­man, which has au­dio brands such as Har­man Kar­don and JBL un­der its wing, had a vir­tual live press con­fer­ence as well as a booth at this year’s IFA.</p>
    <p>Ms Grace Koh, vice-pres­i­dent and gen­eral man­ager, life­style au­dio divi­sion of Asia Pa­cific at Har­man, says while the phys­i­cal booth is closed to the pub­lic, it is where they meet their most im­por­tant dis­trib­u­tors and re­tail­ers from all over the world.</p>
    <p>“It is im­por­tant for us to have such face-to-face meet­ings,” she says.</p>
    <p>Mr Hong says with the world not re­turn­ing to a pre-pan­demic state for many months, hy­brid events that max­imise safety as well as the hu­man ex­pe­ri­ence are worth look­ing at. But get­ting the bal­ance right will be the chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Mr Ma adds: “Ob­vi­ously, the fea­si­bil­ity of such hy­brid events will de­pend on the lo­cal con­di­tions at the time, such as num­ber of cases, abil­ity to travel and so­cial dis­tanc­ing.”</p>
    <p>One of the big­gest ben­e­fits of con­fer­ences is the in-per­son re­la­tion­ship build­ing, deal-mak­ing and even spon­ta­neous en­coun­ters, and that’s not some­thing that’s easy to repli­cate on­line.</p>
    <p>MR BRYAN MA, market re­search firm IDC’s vice-pres­i­dent of de­vices re­search, on how the hy­brid set-up for this year’s In­ter­na­tionale Funkausste­l­lung tries to sal­vage the value of what re­mains of the phys­i­cal event</p>
