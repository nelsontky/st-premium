    <p>TOKYO • Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga said yes­ter­day he wanted to com­pile a ba­sic pol­icy on a new dig­i­tal agency by the end of this year and sub­mit nec­es­sary Bills to next year’s or­di­nary ses­sion of Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Cre­at­ing an agency to speed up the dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion of Ja­pan’s out­dated government ad­min­is­tra­tion has been a key pledge of Mr Suga, who was named Pre­mier last week.</p>
    <p>While the government has made “dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion” its main pol­icy plank this year, the switch has proved dif­fi­cult due partly to a ver­ti­cally struc­tured bu­reau­cracy that ham­pers ef­forts to use com­mon plat­forms for ad­min­is­tra­tive work.</p>
    <p>“We need to make a dig­i­tal agency as an or­gan­i­sa­tion which will have a func­tion of strong com­mand power with per­son­nel of high abil­ity from pub­lic and pri­vate sec­tors, and lead dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion in the over­all so­ci­ety,” Mr Suga told min­is­ters in a meet­ing.</p>
    <p>“I want to ac­cel­er­ate dis­cus­sions to do so, com­pile ba­sic pol­icy by the end of this year and sub­mit nec­es­sary Bills to next or­di­nary ses­sion of Par­lia­ment.”</p>
    <p>Mr Suga said that set­ting up the dig­i­tal agency would be a re­form which would lead to a change in the na­tion’s econ­omy and the so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>He pledged to make sweep­ing changes to over­come the dig­i­tal woes, which were blamed for de­lay­ing de­liv­ery of cash pay­outs to help cit­i­zens weather the im­pact of the novel coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The government aims to build a dig­i­tal so­ci­ety based on “My num­ber cards” for per­sonal iden­ti­fi­ca­tion and im­prove dig­i­tal ad­min­is­tra­tive pro­ce­dures, an of­fi­cial told re­porters af­ter the meet­ing.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s Dig­i­tal Trans­for­ma­tion Min­is­ter Takuya Hi­rai said in a tweet yes­ter­day that he would launch a prepa­ra­tion team this month.</p>
    <p>“Ja­pan needs to raise its po­ten­tial growth rate by dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion,” said Mr Takuto Murase, se­nior economist at Ja­pan Re­search In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Bank of Ja­pan gov­er­nor Haruhiko Kuroda said it was ready to ex­tend its pro­grammes aimed at eas­ing cor­po­rate fund­ing strains that ex­pire early next year, as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic keeps the eco­nomic out­look highly un­cer­tain.</p>
    <p>He also re­it­er­ated the cen­tral bank’s re­solve to work closely with the government in bat­tling head­winds to Ja­pan’s re­cov­ery such as the fall­out from US-China ten­sions and pro­tec­tion­ism.</p>
    <p>“There’s a good pos­si­bil­ity we will ex­tend the dead­line for the pro­grammes if needed, de­pend­ing on the im­pact of Covid-19,” Mr Kuroda told a news con­fer­ence af­ter his on­line meet­ing with busi­ness lead­ers in Osaka, west­ern Ja­pan, yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We’ll make the de­ci­sion at an ap­pro­pri­ate tim­ing and won’t wait un­til the last minute,” he added.</p>
