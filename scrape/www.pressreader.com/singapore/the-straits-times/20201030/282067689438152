    <p>De­vel­op­ing indige­nous tech­nol­ogy has taken on crit­i­cal im­por­tance be­cause of the US-China tech war, said po­lit­i­cal econ­o­mist Hu Xing­dou. This em­pha­sis on tech­no­log­i­cal self-re­liance was recog­ni­tion from China’s top lead­ers that there was a big gap be­tween the coun­try and other de­vel­oped na­tions in core tech­nolo­gies such as mi­crochips, en­gine tech­nol­ogy and pre­ci­sion in­stru­ments.</p>
    <p>China’s Com­mu­nist Party elite have pledged that the coun­try would be­come a leader in in­no­va­tion by 2035, set­ting a course to sub­stan­tially in­crease the na­tion’s tech­no­log­i­cal strength.</p>
    <p>In a com­mu­nique re­leased yes­ter­day evening at the end of a four­day con­clave of the party’s Cen­tral Com­mit­tee, it said China would achieve ma­jor break­throughs in key core tech­nolo­gies by that year.</p>
    <p>The year 2035 is sig­nif­i­cant as Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping has set it as a midterm tar­get for China to “ba­si­cally re­alise so­cial­ist mod­erni­sa­tion”.</p>
    <p>This is part of his grander vi­sion for the coun­try to be­come a “great, mod­ern so­cial­ist coun­try” by 2049, the 100th an­niver­sary of the found­ing of the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China.</p>
    <p>The com­mu­nique yes­ter­day pro­vided broad strokes of the 2035 plan, em­pha­sis­ing the need for a big jump in China’s eco­nomic, tech­no­log­i­cal and com­pre­hen­sive na­tional strength.</p>
    <p>China should also be at the fore­front of in­no­va­tive coun­tries, said the re­port at the end of the closed­door meet­ing of more than 350 Cen­tral Com­mit­tee mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Known as the Fifth Plenum – so­called be­cause it is the fifth such meet­ing since the 19th Party Congress in 2017 – the meet­ing is also be­ing closely watched for China’s eco­nomic and devel­op­ment pri­or­i­ties over the next five years.</p>
    <p>The 14th Five-Year Plan, a devel­op­ment blue­print, also stressed the core po­si­tion of in­no­va­tion in China’s mod­erni­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Party lead­ers said “tech­no­log­i­cal self-re­liance must be the strate­gic pil­lar of the coun­try’s devel­op­ment”.</p>
    <p>China must “strengthen its strate­gic tech­no­log­i­cal strength and raise the abil­ity of its en­ter­prises to in­no­vate”, said the com­mu­nique.</p>
    <p>While Mr Xi had set sim­i­lar goals for tech­no­log­i­cal progress at the 19th Party Congress, de­vel­op­ing indige­nous tech­nol­ogy has taken on crit­i­cal im­por­tance be­cause of the United States-China tech war, said Bei­jing-based po­lit­i­cal econ­o­mist Hu Xing­dou.</p>
    <p>He pointed out that this em­pha­sis on tech­no­log­i­cal self-re­liance was recog­ni­tion from China’s top lead­ers that there was a big gap be­tween the coun­try and other de­vel­oped na­tions in core tech­nolo­gies such as mi­crochips, en­gine tech­nol­ogy and pre­ci­sion in­stru­ments.</p>
    <p>“China is too far be­hind and the party can see that if there is no indige­nous in­no­va­tion, only a dead end awaits,” said Pro­fes­sor Hu.</p>
    <p>Now that Bei­jing has set down the broad blue­print, it will be up to Chi­nese of­fi­cials down the line to come up with the de­tails.</p>
    <p>The com­mu­nique also ref­er­enced chal­lenges posed by a com­plex in­ter­na­tional en­vi­ron­ment and ris­ing un­cer­tain­ties, but said peace and devel­op­ment were still the main themes for this era.</p>
    <p>This seemed to be an in­di­ca­tion that top lead­ers did not want to in­flame ten­sions with the US, said Prof Hu, adding that the fo­cus was clearly on “im­mers­ing our­selves to de­velop the coun­try”.</p>
    <p>As ex­pected, party lead­ers also dou­bled down on the “dual-cir­cu­la­tion strat­egy” mooted by Mr Xi, which aims to boost do­mes­tic con­sump­tion and re­duce re­liance on for­eign mar­kets in the face of greater un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>China would have to form a strong do­mes­tic mar­ket in or­der to build new pat­terns for devel­op­ment, said the re­port, point­ing out that there was a big gap be­tween the devel­op­ment and in­comes of ur­ban and ru­ral ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Party lead­ers also took stock of China’s achieve­ments and es­ti­mated that gross do­mes­tic prod­uct this year would ex­ceed one tril­lion yuan (S$203.4 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>The coun­try is also ex­pected to lift 55.75 mil­lion peo­ple out of poverty this year.</p>
