    <p>MON­TREAL/SYD­NEY • Air­lines and air­ports were set to ask a United Na­tions-led task force meet­ing yes­ter­day to rec­om­mend that coun­tries ac­cept a neg­a­tive Covid-19 test within 48 hours of travel as an al­ter­na­tive to quar­an­tines that have dec­i­mated demand for travel, ac­cord­ing to a doc­u­ment seen by Reuters.</p>
    <p>The in­dus­try wanted the task force to make the rec­om­men­da­tion for pas­sen­gers trav­el­ling from coun­tries with high Covid-19 in­fec­tion rates when it met yes­ter­day to re­view guide­lines for in­ter­na­tional travel amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“A test prior to de­par­ture could re­duce the risk of im­por­ta­tion by up to 90 per cent, en­abling air travel to be opened up be­tween a large num­ber of coun­tries with­out a quar­an­tine re­quire­ment,” said the pro­posal from Air­ports Coun­cil In­ter­na­tional (ACI) and air­line trade group In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion (Iata).</p>
    <p>“We don’t sup­port across-the­board manda­tory test­ing,” Iata med­i­cal ad­viser David Pow­ell told Reuters.</p>
    <p>“But if there are sit­u­a­tions where there is a higher risk in the coun­try of ori­gin and it can avoid the need for quar­an­tine, then we cer­tainly sup­port that and ad­vo­cate for that con­cept.”</p>
    <p>Dr Pow­ell said the 48-hour pe­riod rec­om­mended by the Iata and ACI was up for dis­cus­sion and that it could make sense for some trav­ellers to take a sec­ond test upon ar­rival at their des­ti­na­tion.</p>
    <p>The push for test­ing comes as the in­dus­try’s hopes for a re­cov­ery were dealt a blow last week when Bri­tain rein­tro­duced quar­an­tines on trav­ellers from France and the Nether­lands.</p>
    <p>Air­lines are fore­cast­ing a 55 per cent de­cline in air traf­fic this year, ac­cord­ing to the Iata, which re­ported that 85 per cent of sur­veyed trav­ellers ex­pressed about quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>The pro­posal calls for the use of PCR or poly­merase chain re­ac­tion tests con­ducted out­side of air­ports.</p>
    <p>The task force did not raise test­ing as an al­ter­na­tive to quar­an­tines in May when it rec­om­mended a uni­form ap­proach towards re­viv­ing flights. How­ever, there is the pos­si­bil­ity of this hap­pen­ing after yes­ter­day’s meet­ing.</p>
    <p>The UN’s In­ter­na­tional Civil Avi­a­con­cerns tion Or­gan­i­sa­tion (ICAO) was not im­me­di­ately avail­able for com­ment. While task force rec­om­men­da­tions are vol­un­tary, ICAO guide­lines are typ­i­cally adopted by its 193 mem­ber coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Re­quir­ing test­ing raises cost is­sues for trav­ellers, given air­lines are un­likely to bear the ap­prox­i­mate US$200 (S$270) ex­pense.</p>
    <p>The sec­tor faces up to US$314 bil­lion in lost rev­enue in 2020, ac­cord­ing to ICAO fore­casts.</p>
