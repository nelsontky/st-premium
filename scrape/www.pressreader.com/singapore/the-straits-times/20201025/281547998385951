    <p>Gar­den­ing en­thu­si­asts and more fam­i­lies can nur­ture their own small gar­dens as the Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) is dou­bling the num­ber of avail­able plots to 2,000 over the next year.</p>
    <p>The new plots, each slightly larger than a queen-size bed, will be spread across 18 parks, in­clud­ing Alju­nied Park, Choa Chu Kang Park, Pung­gol Wa­ter­way Park and West Coast Park.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­ca­tions are open un­til Nov 8. Along with the ex­tra al­lot­ments, NParks will also dis­trib­ute about 60,000 seeds – such as for kangkong and Chi­nese spinach – to the pub­lic, and hold free on­line mas­ter classes on how to grow more dif­fi­cult va­ri­eties like cap­sicums and toma­toes.</p>
    <p>Th­ese vir­tual classes, which were launched as part of NParks’ fourth Com­mu­nity Gar­den Fes­ti­val at HortPark yes­ter­day, are run­ning this week­end.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants can redeem free seeds of ed­i­ble plants and learn plant­ing tips and tech­niques through live demon­stra­tions.</p>
    <p>The classes will also be avail­able for free on the NParks YouTube chan­nel at youtube.com/NPark­sSG</p>
    <p>NParks also an­nounced two new at­trac­tions yes­ter­day – My Back­yard Kitchen and Val­ley of Ed­i­bles – at HortPark, show­cas­ing ed­i­bles such as lady’s fin­gers and brin­jal.</p>
    <p>The Com­mu­nity Gar­den Fes­ti­val is part of the ed­i­ble hor­ti­cul­ture mas­ter plan, launched by NParks in 2017, to in­crease knowl­edge and in­ter­est in com­mu­nity gar­den­ing by</p>
    <p>pro­vid­ing sup­port to the pub­lic through prac­ti­cal and ma­te­rial re­sources.</p>
    <p>Un­der this mas­ter plan, NParks will add more spa­ces for gar­den­ing, train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties and outreach pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>At yes­ter­day’s event, the win­ners of the Com­mu­nity In Bloom awards, which recog­nise ex­cel­lence in gar­den­ing ef­forts by com­mu­nity groups, were also an­nounced. All par­tic­i­pat­ing gar­dens were awarded an achieve­ment</p>
    <p>band of bronze, sil­ver, gold or plat­inum.</p>
    <p>Gar­dens that have achieved plat­inum awards for three years in a row were el­e­vated to the di­a­mond band, which was ac­corded to 17 gar­dens this year.</p>
    <p>NParks said this was the high­est num­ber of di­a­mond awards given out in a year, rep­re­sent­ing a “ris­ing qual­ity in com­mu­nity gar­dens”.</p>
    <p>The award win­ners said the gar­dens have forged a com­mu­nity</p>
    <p>build­ing spirit among those who work on them.</p>
    <p>Mrs Rina Lai, 49, of the Toh Yi res­i­dents’ network, a di­a­mond award win­ner, said she had dif­fi­culty rein­te­grat­ing into the Sin­ga­pore com­mu­nity when she re­turned eight years ago af­ter be­ing in Bri­tain for six years.</p>
    <p>Through the com­mu­nity gar­den­ing pro­grammes, she was able to meet other peo­ple and form a sense of belonging in her es­tate, said Mrs Lai, who is self-em­ployed.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Desmond Lee, speak­ing at the open­ing of the event, also high­lighted the pos­i­tive ef­fect gar­den­ing can have on so­cial well-be­ing, es­pe­cially in the midst of the pandemic.</p>
    <p>“This is a mean­ing­ful ac­tiv­ity that can strengthen bonds be­tween friends, fam­i­lies and so­ci­ety. It can bring us hope and cheer dur­ing chal­leng­ing times,” he said.</p>
