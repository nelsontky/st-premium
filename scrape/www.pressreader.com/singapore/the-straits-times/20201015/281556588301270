    <p>In­dian sci­en­tists have de­vel­oped a pa­per strip test for Covid-19 that is quick and easy like a preg­nancy test. The test is based on a tech­nol­ogy that can de­tect genes spe­cific to the coro­n­avirus. Test­ing kits, to be man­u­fac­tured by con­glom­er­ate Tata Group, were ap­proved by In­dia’s drug author­ity last month. A Tata Sons spokesman said the prod­uct will be in the mar­ket in a couple of months.</p>
    <p>A fast and easy pa­per-strip test for Covid 19, much like a preg­nancy test, is set to hit the mar­ket, and it could be a game changer for In­dia as it seeks to curb the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The idea was first sparked over a cup of tea by its in­ven­tors.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, when In­dia re­ported its first coro­n­avirus case, chem­i­cal bi­ol­o­gist Sou­vik Maiti, 49, and molec­u­lar bi­ol­o­gist De­bo­jy­oti Chakrabort­y, 35, thought of re-engi­neer­ing their pa­per-based test de­vel­oped to de­tect sickle cell anaemia, a red blood cell dis­or­der, for Covid 19.</p>
    <p>Both of them are based at the Delhi-based Coun­cil of Sci­en­tific and In­dus­trial Re­search’s In­sti­tute of Ge­nomics and In­te­gra­tive Bi­ol­ogy, and had been work­ing on their in­ven­tion for over two years.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 test pro­to­type was ready in two months, said Dr Maiti.</p>
    <p>They named the test Feluda – for FNCAS9 Ed­i­tor-Lim­ited Uni­form De­tec­tion As­say – and in a nod to a much loved fic­tional de­tec­tive of the same name cre­ated by film direc­tor and writer Satya­jit Ray.</p>
    <p>By May, the Tata Group, a lead­ing In­dian con­glom­er­ate, had been cho­sen to man­u­fac­ture the test­ing kits, which re­ceived ap­proval from In­dia’s drug author­ity last month.</p>
    <p>“In a couple of weeks, we will have the prod­uct in the mar­ket,” said a Tata Sons spokesman.</p>
    <p>The test, which pro­vides re­sults in less than an hour, is based on a tech­nol­ogy called CRISPR-Cas, which can de­tect genes spe­cific to the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“It will be cheaper, much faster and eas­ier,” said Dr Maiti.</p>
    <p>He said the test re­quired only a PCR (poly­merase chain re­ac­tion) ma­chine, which is com­monly found in labs and col­leges. Batteryope­rated ver­sions of the ma­chine mean it is highly por­ta­ble.</p>
    <p>“No (other) spe­cial equip­ment is re­quired. That’s the beauty of this test. To per­form the test, you need a sim­ple ma­chine with low-trained man­power. You don’t need a lab tech­ni­cian. You can de­ploy this in low-re­source ar­eas like Ladakh and other re­mote parts of the coun­try.”</p>
    <p>An early es­ti­mate for the kit puts it at 500 ru­pees (S$9.30), but it will likely be priced higher when it reaches the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>In­dia is the sec­ond-most af­fected coun­try in the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, af­ter the United States. It has 7.2 mil­lion cases, with 110,586 deaths. On Tues­day, 63,509 new con­firmed cases were recorded amid a down­turn in new cases.</p>
    <p>The South Asian coun­try has ramped up test­ing from 1,000 a day in March to 1.1 mil­lion per day now.</p>
    <p>Test­ing is cru­cial for the coun­try of 1.35 bil­lion peo­ple, as early de­tec­tion helps to curb trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>At present, In­dia uses two types of tests. One is the RT-PCR (re­verse tran­scrip­tion-poly­merase chain re­ac­tion) test, which takes any­where from four hours to a day for re­sults and is con­sid­ered the gold stan­dard of test­ing. Such a test can cost up to 4,500 ru­pees.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond is the rapid anti­gen test, which gives re­sults within 30 min­utes and is cheaper, cost­ing not more than 750 ru­pees per test. But it is also seen to be un­re­li­able, given the high rate of false neg­a­tives.</p>
    <p>It is not known how many rapid anti­gen tests are ad­min­is­tered, which only fu­els con­cerns that coro­n­avirus case num­bers in the coun­try are be­ing un­der-re­ported. Sero­log­i­cal sur­veys have shown that many more were in­fected than the of­fi­cial es­ti­mates had sug­gested.</p>
    <p>The pa­per strip test has so far shown an ac­cu­racy rate close to that of the RT-PCR test.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing tri­als, tests of more than 2,000 pa­tients showed 96 per cent sen­si­tiv­ity and 98 per cent speci­ficity.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said the pa­per test could be a game changer.</p>
    <p>“If they have said it is more ac­cu­rate than the anti­gen test and is quicker and cheaper, it would be ben­e­fi­cial,” said epi­demi­ol­o­gist</p>
    <p>Jayaprakas­h Muliyil.</p>
    <p>“This one may be able to re­place the anti­gen test­ing.”</p>
    <p>In­dia has seen other in­no­va­tions since the coro­n­avirus pan­demic hit the coun­try. They range from a toaster-sized ven­ti­la­tor to pooled test­ing to de­tect the virus in large pop­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>The Feluda test has al­ready ig­nited in­ter­na­tional in­ter­est, with in­quiries about the test and its avail­abil­ity com­ing in from coun­tries around the world.</p>
    <p>“In­dia’s sci­en­tific in­sti­tu­tions are re­spond­ing to the pan­demic with in­no­va­tion on the fast track. Feluda is a prod­uct that tes­ti­fies to their strength,” said Pro­fes­sor K. Sri­nath Reddy, pres­i­dent of the Public Health Foun­da­tion of In­dia.</p>
    <p>“The in­no­va­tion must, how­ever, prove its met­tle in the field. We wait ea­gerly for the ev­i­dence of how this promis­ing bats­man per­forms on the field af­ter step­ping out of the dress­ing room,” he said.</p>
    <p>“If it per­forms nearly as well in field set­tings, it can be a game changer for early case de­tec­tion.”</p>
