    <p>• Tom Hanks does not like his new hair – or lack thereof.</p>
    <p>The Hol­ly­wood ac­tor ap­peared re­motely on the Bri­tish chat show The Gra­ham Nor­ton Show on Tues­day wear­ing a base­ball cap.</p>
    <p>Hanks, 64, re­vealed that he is in Aus­tralia work­ing on an up­com­ing bi­o­graph­i­cal drama fil m about Elvis Pres­ley, the “King of Rock and Roll”.</p>
    <p>The biopic, di­rected by Baz Luhrmann, stars ac­tor Austin But­ler as Pres­ley, while Hanks plays Pres­ley’s man­ager Colonel Tom Parker.</p>
    <p>“Let me show you the hor­ri­ble hair­cut I have to have in or­der to por­tray Colonel Tom Parker,” Hanks said, stand­ing and block­ing the screen with his hair. “Check out this hor­ri­ble... Can you see that? Look at that thing.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter pre­sen­ter Gra­ham Nor­ton asked him to sit down, Hanks showed his bald head briefly be­fore he put on his cap again.</p>
    <p>“I just scared the chil­dren,” he joked. “I want to apol­o­gise for show­ing that.”</p>
    <p>This is not Hanks’ first ap­pear­ance with a bald head. He was hair­less when he ap­peared in Satur­day Night Live’s first at-home episode last April.</p>
    <p>The star of For­rest Gump (1994) and Sav­ing Pri­vate Ryan (1998) can be seen in the re­cently re­leased movie News Of The World, his first Western.</p>
    <p>He and his wife, actress Rita Wil­son, also 64, were among the first celebri­ties to an­nounce that they had tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus, do­ing so last March while he was film­ing in Aus­tralia.</p>
