    <p>Res­i­dents of East Coast GRC can look for­ward to more green spa­ces and also op­por­tu­ni­ties to take part in ini­tia­tives which pro­tect the en­vi­ron­ment, un­der a new plan launched yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The East Coast Sus­tain­abil­ity and Green­ery Plan aims to cre­ate more plat­forms to ed­u­cate res­i­dents on en­vi­ron­men­tal is­sues, and en­cour­age those who are pas­sion­ate about the en­vi­ron­ment to take ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Ef­forts to in­ject green­ery into community spa­ces and the built en­vi­ron­ment will also be stepped up.</p>
    <p>Un­veil­ing the blue­print on Face­book Live yes­ter­day, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and Fi­nance Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat, who is also an MP for East Coast GRC, said it is im­por­tant for East Coast GRC – an area with rich bio­di­ver­sity, beaches and coastal ar­eas – to play its part in pre­serv­ing the en­vi­ron­ment. He added that the East Coast GRC team aims to part­ner res­i­dents in com­ing up with ideas for new green ini­tia­tives in the con­stituency, and that he is glad to see many al­ready step­ping for­ward to do so.</p>
    <p>“This is very much in the spirit of Sin­ga­pore To­gether, where peo­ple with sim­i­lar ideas come to­gether and do some­thing to re­alise those ideas,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore To­gether move­ment was started by Mr Heng and his team of fourth-gen­er­a­tion po­lit­i­cal lead­ers last year to give cit­i­zens a big­ger say in pol­i­cy­mak­ing.</p>
    <p>One idea that has taken root is the</p>
    <p>Green Am­bas­sador scheme, which kicked off last month. It now has a pi­lot batch of 20 am­bas­sadors, with plans in place to train up to 300 am­bas­sadors over three years.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents at an ear­lier East Coast Con­ver­sa­tions di­a­logue had mooted the idea to get vol­un­teers</p>
    <p>as am­bas­sadors to boost aware­ness of en­vi­ron­men­tal is­sues in the community.</p>
    <p>At the same launch, the other East Coast GRC MPs – Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice Ma­liki Os­man, Min­is­ter of State in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice and for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Tan Kiat How, Ms Jes­sica Tan and Ms Ch­eryl Chan – elab­o­rated on the sus­tain­abil­ity and green­ery plan. They said the plan is to grow the num­ber of community gar­dens be­yond the ex­ist­ing 130, and of­fer op­por­tu­ni­ties to doc­u­ment, con­serve and en­hance nat­u­ral habi­tats in East Coast.</p>
    <p>Project co­or­di­na­tor An­ge­line Lim, a Simei res­i­dent, signed up to be a green am­bas­sador around Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>The 34-year-old and her fel­low am­bas­sadors have at­tended meet­ings on Zoom to brain­storm ideas to make their es­tates more green and sus­tain­able. She has also picked up use­ful tips on how to pro­tect the en­vi­ron­ment through these ses­sions, and will be pass­ing them on.</p>
    <p>“For in­stance, not ev­ery­one may know that cer­tain plas­tics that have been con­tam­i­nated with food waste can­not be re­cy­cled. These are things I can share with my par­ents, par­ents-in-law and my peers,” she added.</p>
