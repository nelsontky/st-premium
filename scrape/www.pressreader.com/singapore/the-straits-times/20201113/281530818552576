    <p>Re­bates on the pur­chase of cleaner cars will be in­creased from Jan 1 next year to Dec 31, 2022, un­der the Ve­hic­u­lar Emis­sions Scheme. Cleaner taxis will have their re­bates in­creased. In the car­rot-and-stick model, sur­charges for more pol­lu­tive ve­hi­cles will also be in­creased – by $5,000 for cars and $7,500 for taxis.</p>
    <p>Re­bates on the pur­chase of cleaner cars will be in­creased by $5,000 from Jan 1 next year to Dec 31, 2022, un­der the Ve­hic­u­lar Emis­sions Scheme (VES).</p>
    <p>Cleaner taxis will have their re­bates in­creased by $7,500 in the same time pe­riod, un­der the pro­gramme aimed at nudg­ing mo­torists to­wards more en­vi­ron­men­tally friendly mod­els of pri­vate trans­port.</p>
    <p>In the car­rot-and-stick model, sur­charges for more pol­lu­tive ve­hi­cles will also be in­creased – by $5,000 for cars and $7,500 for taxis.</p>
    <p>This will kick in on July 1 next year in­stead of at the start of the year to al­low time for the mar­ket to ad­just, and will be in ef­fect un­til Dec 31, 2022, the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) and Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) said in a joint state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The in­creased re­bates and sur­charges mean buy­ers of cleaner cars will be awarded with re­bates of up to $25,000, up from the pre­vi­ous $20,000, while buy­ers of the most pol­lu­tive cars will be pe­nalised by $25,000, also up from $20,000.</p>
    <p>The VES was in­tro­duced in 2018 to re­duce car­bon emis­sions on Sin­ga­pore’s roads. It cat­e­gorises ve­hi­cles based on emis­sions across five pol­lu­tants, with each cat­e­gory’s re­bate or sur­charge cal­i­brated ac­cord­ingly.</p>
    <p>NEA and LTA said the scheme has been ef­fec­tive in en­cour­ag­ing the pur­chase of cleaner car mod­els, with the num­ber of new cars that qual­ify for the clean­est two bands in­creas­ing by 60 per cent be­tween the third quar­ter of 2018 and the first quar­ter of this year.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of those in the most pol­lu­tive two bands has fallen by around 20 per cent in the same time pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Uni­ver­sity of So­cial Sciences as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of eco­nom­ics Wal­ter Th­e­seira said the VES re­bates and sur­charges could push mo­torists to­wards the adop­tion of cleaner cars in two ways.</p>
    <p>As mo­tor car deal­ers usu­ally quote a price in­clu­sive of all taxes and cer­tifi­cate of en­ti­tle­ment bid­ding, a por­tion of the dis­counts usu­ally goes to car buy­ers, while an­other could go to the deal­ers.</p>
    <p>This means that in ad­di­tion to con­sumers get­ting a dis­count, the VES changes could also en­cour­age car deal­ers to im­port cleaner mod­els.</p>
    <p>Cleaner cars in­clude the Hyundai Kona Elec­tric, Re­nault Zoe and Toy­ota Prius Plus, while more pol­lu­tive cars are those like the Mit­subishi Out­lander 2.0 CVT, Mazda CX-5 2.5 AT and Porsche Cayenne E3.</p>
    <p>The en­hanced VES is also a boon for as­pir­ing elec­tric car buy­ers, whose car mod­els of­ten fall un­der the clean­est bands.</p>
    <p>To­gether with the early adop­tion in­cen­tive scheme for elec­tric ve­hi­cle buy­ers an­nounced by LTA in Fe­bru­ary – which of­fers re­bates capped at $20,000 per ve­hi­cle – the in­creased re­bates un­der the VES will al­low for sav­ings of up to $45,000 for each new fully elec­tric car.</p>
    <p>How­ever, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor</p>
    <p>Th­e­seira noted that there are ad­di­tional fac­tors to con­sider with re­gard to elec­tric ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>“The num­ber of elec­tric ve­hi­cle mod­els is still very lim­ited com­pared with that of in­ter­nal com­bus­tion en­gines. Elec­tric ve­hi­cles also re­quire the owner to have avail­able charg­ing. I think un­til these two are solved, the VES change will have min­i­mal ef­fect,” he said.</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said yes­ter­day that industry watch­ers be­lieve that costs for mo­torists choos­ing be­tween elec­tric ve­hi­cles and in­ter­nal com­bus­tion en­gine ve­hi­cles will equalise by around 2025, or ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Elec­tric mod­els are now still gen­er­ally more ex­pen­sive, and there were only 1,125 elec­tric cars on the road as at Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong re­ferred to Sin­ga­pore’s elec­tric ve­hi­cle-charg­ing in­fra­struc­ture, which has been cited as a po­ten­tial bot­tle­neck by industry watch­ers who be­lieve the lack of charg­ers could stop Sin­ga­pore’s elec­tric dreams in its tracks.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore cur­rently has 1,800 charg­ing points and is plan­ning to in­crease this to 28,000 by 2030.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong re­peated what he said in</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment last month – that the au­thor­i­ties are re­view­ing this plan to see if it could be made more am­bi­tious by rop­ing in com­mer­cial par­ties.</p>
    <p>“What is clear is that EVs (elec­tric ve­hi­cles) will be­come a re­al­ity, but we need to em­brace and pro­mote it,” he said.</p>
