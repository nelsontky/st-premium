    <p>With cases of Covid-19 in­fec­tion hav­ing re­mained sta­ble in the com­mu­nity at one case per day on av­er­age over the last fort­night, and with the caseload in work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries hav­ing also trended down, it seems ap­pro­pri­ate to embark on the latest phase of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing. While this will bring more of a sem­blance of nor­malcy to busi­ness and so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties, it also en­tails new risks that must be man­aged. Start­ing next week, more staff will be able to work from of­fices; work­place events of up to 50 peo­ple can re­sume; wor­ship ser­vices and wed­dings for up to 100 at­ten­dees will be per­mit­ted; and a scheme to al­low es­sen­tial travel for se­nior ex­ec­u­tives will go into ef­fect, with safe­guards. But this cal­i­brated re­open­ing, while pro­vid­ing re­lief to busi­ness and so­ci­ety, also in­creases the scope for com­mu­nity spread – given that the virus trans­mits more eas­ily in­doors – un­less proper pre­cau­tions are put in place.</p>
    <p>For busi­nesses, the new guide­lines state that work­ing re­motely must re­main the de­fault op­tion for staff, for at least half their work­ing hours. Com­pa­nies should en­sure that this is even more rig­or­ously ap­plied in the case of older work­ers and those with pre-ex­ist­ing med­i­cal con­di­tions. At work­places, safe man­age­ment mea­sures will need to be stepped up. These in­clude re­quire­ments for tem­per­a­ture checks, mask wear­ing and reg­u­lar dis­in­fec­tions, the in­stal­la­tion of pan­els and par­ti­tions, es­pe­cially in open-plan of­fices, and the main­te­nance of so­cial dis­tanc­ing dur­ing meet­ings and events. Stag­gered re­port­ing times and split team ar­range­ments also need to be in place to min­imise over­crowd­ing. Or­gan­is­ers of wed­dings and reli­gious ser­vices would need to take sim­i­lar pre­cau­tions. While this latest lift­ing of curbs will hope­fully pro­ceed at least as smoothly as the eas­ing of mea­sures made pre­vi­ously, in­ter­na­tional ex­pe­ri­ence high­lights the pos­si­ble risks.</p>
    <p>What we have learnt is that Covid-19 ebbs and flows. In­fec­tion rates can flare up well af­ter the virus is reck­oned to have re­ceded. For in­stance, coun­tries and re­gions which suc­cess­fully con­tained Covid-19 such as Hong Kong, South Korea, Ja­pan, Is­rael, Viet­nam and Aus­tralia’s Vic­to­ria state saw in­fec­tions spike af­ter re­open­ings, de­spite hav­ing recorded low cases for weeks.</p>
    <p>In Europe, Bri­tain, France and Spain re­ported a surge of new in­fec­tions re­cently af­ter ini­tially con­tain­ing the spread. Such re­lapses were partly the re­sult of safety pro­to­cols be­ing dis­re­garded once there was an eas­ing of mea­sures. In some cases, such as Hong Kong, they also hap­pened be­cause of pre­ma­ture border open­ings and the re­lax­ation of quar­an­tine re­quire­ments. In oth­ers, such as Bri­tain, test­ing and trac­ing mea­sures were de­fi­cient. The latest eas­ing of mea­sures here is a cal­cu­lated risk. But with the right pre­cau­tions, draw­ing on ex­pe­ri­ence else­where, it could pay off.</p>
