    <p>The Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) will take an­other step to­wards nor­malcy with the launch of its 2020-21 sea­son that has in­stalled the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers, bol­stered by a flurry of off-sea­son moves, as favourites to re­peat as cham­pi­ons.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the league held the fi­nal three months of last sea­son at Dis­ney World in a bio-se­cure bub­ble to ward off Covid-19, teams will re­sume road games when the reg­u­lar sea­son tips off to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>The Lak­ers re­main the team to beat. Since win­ning a record-ty­ing 17th cham­pi­onship in Oc­to­ber, they have ac­quired some of the best avail­able play­ers in the off-sea­son, giv­ing their core duo of LeBron James and An­thony Davis a much changed – but ac­cord­ing to the crit­ics, bet­ter sup­port­ing cast.</p>
    <p>The ac­qui­si­tion of reign­ing Sixth Man of the Year Mon­trezl Har­rell, run­ner-up Den­nis Schroder along with vet­er­ans Marc Ga­sol, 35, and</p>
    <p>CRE­AT­ING A LEGACY</p>
    <p>Play­ing this game, you want to be re­mem­bered. You want to be leg­endary… The best way to do that is to win, and to win at the high­est level.</p>
    <p>Wes­ley Matthews, 34, should help ease some of the bur­den car­ried by Fi­nals Most Valu­able Player (MVP) James.</p>
    <p>Out went Danny Green, Dwight Howard, JaVale McGee and Ra­jon Rondo but All-Star for­ward Davis has been buoyed by what he has seen in pre-sea­son, claim­ing the team are “do­ing things that we’re not re­ally sup­posed to be do­ing this early”.</p>
    <p>“We feel good, we feel very good,” he told the Or­ange County Reg­is­ter (OCR). “The things we’re able to do on the de­fen­sive end so</p>
    <p>quickly with our new guys, it in­volves a lot of trust, it in­volves a lot of the new guys car­ing about play­ing de­fence, and it’s about our schemes.”</p>
    <p>Last sea­son, guard Schroder and for­ward Har­rell fin­ished first and sec­ond in the league re­spec­tively in points scored off the bench. Their pres­ence – shoot­ing 47.1 per cent and 58.1 per cent re­spec­tively from the field – means they can take the scor­ing load off James and Davis. It will also al­low Lak­ers coach Frank Vo­gel to em­ploy “load man­age­ment”, giv­ing his star pair</p>
    <p>ing the op­por­tu­nity to rest in what is a tough, con­densed sched­ule.</p>
    <p>Har­rell in par­tic­u­lar is a ma­jor up­grade on Howard and McGee, whom the Lak­ers al­ter­nated be­tween at cen­tre po­si­tion last term.</p>
    <p>Only three men – MVP Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo, Zion Wil­liamson and Rus­sell West­brook – scored more points in the paint than the for­mer Los An­ge­les Clip­pers big man, who man­aged 14.8 points last term. With an av­er­age of 52.8 points, the Lak­ers were al­ready the sec­ond-high­est scor­ers in the paint last sea­son and Har­rell is set</p>
    <p>to make them an even more daunt­ing team to de­fend against.</p>
    <p>To re­peat as cham­pi­ons takes dom­i­nance but with even bet­ter team­mates, James is con­fi­dent of win­ning his fifth ti­tle and strength­en­ing his case as the great­est of all time.</p>
    <p>“Play­ing this game, you want to be re­mem­bered,” the All-Star for­ward told OCR. “You want to be leg­endary… per­haps as one of the great­est teams, or the great­est play­ers, what­ever the case may be. The best way to do that is to win, and to win at the high­est level.”</p>
    <p>LEBRON JAMES, Los An­ge­les Lak­ers star wants to add to his four NBA ti­tles.</p>
