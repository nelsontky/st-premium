    <p>Due to the Covid-19 pan­demic and eco­nomic re­ces­sion, more fam­i­lies will be in need of fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>How can we im­prove the pro­cesses to en­sure that fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance schemes are more ac­ces­si­ble to and in­clu­sive of those who have fallen on hard times?</p>
    <p>From my own ex­pe­ri­ence as part of a com­mu­nity ef­fort as­sist­ing low-in­come fam­i­lies with their ap­pli­ca­tions for fi­nan­cial aid, I have ob­served how te­dious and com­pli­cated the pro­cesses can be. It is espe­cially try­ing for those who are less lit­er­ate or tech­no­log­i­cally savvy.</p>
    <p>The Self-Em­ployed Per­son In­come Re­lief Scheme (Sirs) ap­pli­ca­tion process, for in­stance, poses nu­mer­ous chal­lenges for ap­pli­cants.</p>
    <p>Low-in­come, odd-job work­ers tend to work in in­for­mal sec­tors that pay them in cash and rarely pro­vide in­come doc­u­men­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>They also face is­sues nav­i­gat­ing govern­ment web­sites such as SingPass, and are un­able to un­der­stand the types of doc­u­men­ta­tion they have to present.</p>
    <p>This makes it dif­fi­cult for them to prove their in­come loss. Thus, many give up mid­way through an ap­pli­ca­tion or find the process too com­pli­cated and in­tim­i­dat­ing to even try, even though they have ex­pe­ri­enced sig­nif­i­cant in­come loss.</p>
    <p>Some have also ex­pressed feel­ings of help­less­ness and dis­em­pow­er­ment.</p>
    <p>I hope Sirs can be made more ac­ces­si­ble. Its el­i­gi­bil­ity cri­te­ria should be made more in­clu­sive of self-em­ployed per­sons work­ing in in­for­mal sec­tors, and its ap­pli­ca­tion process sim­pli­fied.</p>
    <p>Hot­lines ded­i­cated to pro­vid­ing ap­pli­cants with step-by-step guid­ance for their Sirs ap­pli­ca­tions could also be set up to en­sure that im­me­di­ate as­sis­tance is avail­able for those who need it.</p>
    <p>The re­duc­tion of red tape in ap­pli­ca­tion pro­cesses should be ap­plied to all as­sis­tance schemes. This way, we can bet­ter en­sure that those who need as­sis­tance are able to ac­cess what they are en­ti­tled to, with­out be­ing sub­jected to un­nec­es­sar­ily high lev­els of screen­ing.</p>
