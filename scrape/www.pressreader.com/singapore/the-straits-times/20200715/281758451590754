    <p>rants in the city could suf­fer a 35 to 40 per cent plunge in sales this month.</p>
    <p>In the past two months, so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures were re­laxed, with con­sumers be­gin­ning to shop and dine again, rais­ing hopes for an im­prove­ment in the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The city’s re­ces­sion has deep­ened in the first quar­ter, with gross do­mes­tic prod­uct shrink­ing sharply by 8.9 per cent from a year ear­lier, the steep­est plunge for a sin­gle quar­ter on record.</p>
    <p>Af­ter last Thurs­day’s tight­en­ing of re­stric­tions, where the ca­pac­ity of eater­ies was low­ered, Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Carrie Lam on Mon­day said more clus­ters were de­tected in more ar­eas, which called for tougher mea­sures.</p>
    <p>From to­day, no din­ing in will be al­lowed at all eater­ies from 6pm to 5am. Only up to four pa­trons will be al­lowed at each ta­ble.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has also added a new rule that car­ries a fine of HK$5,000 (S$900) – the manda­tory wear­ing of face masks on pub­lic trans­port. Driv­ers of cabs and buses can refuse to ferry a pas­sen­ger with­out a mask.</p>
    <p>All gath­er­ings will be capped at four peo­ple, while venues un­der a dozen cat­e­gories – in­clud­ing gam­ing cen­tres, bars, gyms and cin­e­mas – will shut for seven days.</p>
    <p>To beef up cross-bor­der mea­sures, those fly­ing to Hong Kong from high-risk ar­eas will have to show they tested neg­a­tive for the virus be­fore board­ing a flight.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day night, the city’s two theme parks – Ocean Park and Hong Kong Dis­ney­land – which re­opened last month af­ter months of clo­sure fol­low­ing an out­break in March, said their doors would shut from to­day till July 21.</p>
    <p>Signs of panic buy­ing have also emerged as shelves with pa­per prod­ucts are empty again in some shops.</p>
    <p>Su­per­mar­ket chain Well­come has an­nounced lim­its on the pur­chase of items such as rice, eggs, tis­sue, canned foods and toi­let pa­per.</p>
