        TOPOF THE NEWS A7 THE STRAITS TIMES TUESDAY, AUGUST 11, 2020 | | | 1 When a virus infects a cell, the cell is altered. The virus then replicates inside the affected cell. Cell 2 Proteins on the surface of the infected cells, known as major histocompa­tibility complex (MHC), present fragments of the virus proteins (known as peptides) for recognitio­n by circulatin­g T cells. An MHC bound to peptides is called the peptide-MHC complex. MHC Virusinfec­ted cell Peptide 3 When this happens, specific T cells are alerted to prepare for battle.
These T cells are able to recognise the infected cells. Virusinfec­ted cell T cell 4 The specific T cells bind to the peptide-MHC complex and kill the infected cells, therefore limiting virus spread. T cell What does ImmunoScap­e’s immune profiling technology do? • It identifies virus-specific T cells by screening for T cells that bind to the virus peptide-MHC complexes
By doing so, it can identify the specific T cells that are able to target Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19
Scientists and pharmaceut­ical companies can then use this informatio­n to design effective vaccines and treatments • • Source: IMMUNOSCAP­E STRAITS TIMES GRAPHICS PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTE­D BY PRESSREADE­R PressReade­r.com +1 604 278 4604 ORIGINAL COPY .
