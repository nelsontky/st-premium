    <p>Sin­ga­pore wants its young peo­ple to come up with in­no­va­tive so­lu­tions to spur sus­tain­abil­ity in com­pa­nies and the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Me­dia out­let Eco-Busi­ness’ non­profit arm EB Im­pact has started a men­tor­ship pro­gramme where groups of young peo­ple will help to solve en­vi­ron­men­tal is­sues for com­pa­nies, un­der the guid­ance of pro­fes­sion­als in the green sec­tor.</p>
    <p>This ini­tia­tive, which has seen 63 youth and 52 men­tors sign­ing up so far since the mid­dle of last month, was of­fi­cially launched at a vir­tual di­a­logue yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The event in­cluded Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment, and Trans­port, Dr Amy Khor, stu­dents, cli­mate ac­tivists and pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>The men­tor­ship pro­gramme, called Sus­tain­abil­ity Ex­change, also opened a sec­ond round of ap­pli­ca­tions yes­ter­day on the EB Im­pact web­site, which will close on Dec 11.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­cants must be aged be­tween 19 and 30, and they should be pas­sion­ate about sus­tain­abil­ity is­sues and have shown some ac­tivism in green causes. Men­tors should have at least five years of ex­pe­ri­ence in a green-re­lated field.</p>
    <p>Each men­tor will be matched with three to four young peo­ple based on their in­ter­ests. The three­month men­tor­ship will start on Jan 11 and end in April.</p>
    <p>At the end of the pro­gramme, the youth have to sub­mit a writ­ten re­port ex­plain­ing their so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme is held in part­ner­ship with Face­book and sup­ported by Cli­mate Ac­tion SG Al­liance.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the di­a­logue, Dr Khor high­lighted four ar­eas that she hopes young peo­ple will act upon: com­ing up with zero-waste strate­gies to cut the amount of waste go­ing into Se­makau Land­fill by 2030, re­search into tech­nolo­gies for con­vert­ing waste into use­ful prod­ucts, cli­mate sci­ence, and ways to pro­tect the coast against sea-level rise.</p>
    <p>She stressed that youth should un­der­stand the “in­tri­ca­cies, the con­sid­er­a­tions and the trade-offs that are of­ten re­quired when in­cor­po­rat­ing sus­tain­abil­ity in poli­cies and busi­ness de­ci­sions”.</p>
    <p>She added: “This will en­able them to ef­fec­tively lead the charge against cli­mate change.”</p>
    <p>One pro­fes­sional who has signed up to be a men­tor is Ms May Liew, elec­tric­ity and gas provider SP Group’s head of sus­tain­abil­ity and open in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>It re­cently re­leased a fea­ture on its app that al­lows cus­tomers to buy green cred­its and sup­port re­new­able-en­ergy projects. Ms Liew hopes to hear from her mentees on ways to mar­ket this ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>Ms Sheri Zuleika, 22, an un­der­grad­u­ate at Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity (SMU) who joined the pro­gramme, is no stranger to green so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>She and two friends from SMU and the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s In­sti­tute of Sys­tems Sci­ence re­cently joined a com­pe­ti­tion where they pro­posed ways to re­duce food and gen­eral waste on Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) flights.</p>
    <p>To en­sure that SIA still makes money from sus­tain­able de­ci­sions, they sug­gested that it could sell the en­ergy from pro­cessed food waste.</p>
    <p>The North West Com­mu­nity De­vel­op­ment Coun­cil is also call­ing for more young peo­ple and stu­dents from the district to pro­pose sus­tain­able ideas.</p>
    <p>Last year, it an­nounced a fund of $300,000 to sup­port ground-up en­vi­ron­men­tal projects, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, stu­dents from North­land Sec­ondary School made use of an­other en­vi­ron­men­tal fund from the coun­cil to ad­dress the prob­lem of bruised fruit and veg­eta­bles go­ing to waste.</p>
    <p>The stu­dents used the blem­ished pro­duce left on su­per­mar­ket shelves to cook meals and help peo­ple re­alise that “ugly food” is still ed­i­ble.</p>
    <p>Dr Amy Khor high­lighted four ar­eas that she hopes young peo­ple will act upon: com­ing up with zero-waste strate­gies to cut the amount of waste go­ing into Se­makau Land­fill by 2030, re­search into tech­nolo­gies for con­vert­ing waste into use­ful prod­ucts, cli­mate sci­ence, and ways to pro­tect the coast against sea-level rise.</p>
