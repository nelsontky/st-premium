    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s high­est court said yes­ter­day that the Sin­ga­pore Prison Ser­vice is not al­lowed to for­ward copies of in­mates’ doc­u­ments to the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC). If the AGC wishes to have copies of doc­u­ments be­long­ing to a pris­oner, the proper pro­ce­dure would be to ob­tain the pris­oner’s con­sent or an or­der of court, said the Court of Ap­peal.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s high­est court said yes­ter­day that the Sin­ga­pore Prison Ser­vice (SPS) is not al­lowed to for­ward copies of in­mates’ doc­u­ments to the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC).</p>
    <p>If the AGC wishes to have copies of let­ters and doc­u­ments be­long­ing to a pris­oner, the proper pro­ce­dure would be to ob­tain the pris­oner’s con­sent or an or­der of court, said the Court of Ap­peal.</p>
    <p>The for­ward­ing of doc­u­ments was high­lighted by the court in a judg­ment dis­miss­ing an ap­peal by two Malaysian in­mates on death row seek­ing to stay their ex­e­cu­tions, pend­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tions into claims that “un­law­ful” meth­ods were be­ing used in ju­di­cial ex­e­cu­tions.</p>
    <p>After the ap­peal was first heard in April, one of the in­mates com­plained that their cor­re­spon­dence with lawyers and fam­ily had been “il­le­gally copied and for­warded” by prison of­fi­cials to the AGC, which is the op­pos­ing party in the case.</p>
    <p>The in­mate, Datchi­na­murthy</p>
    <p>Kata­iah, said this gave the AGC an “un­due ad­van­tage” and sought an or­der prevent­ing SPS from mak­ing copies of their doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>In its judg­ment, the Court of Ap­peal said the SPS is al­lowed to make copies of pris­on­ers’ doc­u­ments un­der prison reg­u­la­tions, but not to for­ward them.</p>
    <p>“These are doc­u­ments and in­for­ma­tion that the SPS has ac­cess to by virtue of its ad­min­is­tra­tive role... to screen and record let­ters, but there was no le­gal ba­sis in the form of a pos­i­tive le­gal right to for­ward copies of the same to the AGC,” said the judg­ment, writ­ten by Judge of Ap­peal An­drew Phang.</p>
    <p>The three-judge court ac­cepted that it was an over­sight in this case and not an at­tempt by the AGC to seek an ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>The two in­mates, Datchi­na­murthy, 35, and Gobi Ave­dian, 32, were pre­vi­ously con­victed and sen­tenced to death in sep­a­rate pro­ceed­ings for drug-re­lated of­fences.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, Malaysia-based non­govern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion Lawyers for Lib­erty (LFL) claimed that ex­e­cu­tions in Sin­ga­pore were car­ried out by kick­ing the back of the pris­oner’s neck if the rope broke.</p>
    <p>The two in­mates, rep­re­sented by lawyer M. Ravi, ap­plied to the High Court for an or­der to stay their ex­e­cu­tions and an or­der to grant im­mu­nity to a former prison of­fi­cer who had given the in­for­ma­tion to LFL.</p>
    <p>At a pre-trial con­fer­ence, a rep­re­sen­ta­tive from the AGC told the court that “we are ex­pressly re­serv­ing all our rights against Mr Ravi”.</p>
    <p>The in­mates said the state­ment amounted to a threat against Mr Ravi and sought an­other or­der to de­clare that their right to coun­sel had been breached. The AGC ar­gued that this was com­mon le­gal par­lance, and that the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral was keep­ing all op­tions open, in­clud­ing seek­ing costs per­son­ally against Mr Ravi.</p>
    <p>The pair’s ap­pli­ca­tions were dis­missed in Fe­bru­ary, and they ap­pealed. Up­hold­ing the lower court de­ci­sion, the Court of Ap­peal said the pair had not pro­duced re­li­able ev­i­dence to sup­port their claims about the ex­e­cu­tion meth­ods.</p>
    <p>It said there was no le­gal ba­sis to grant im­mu­nity as the At­tor­neyGen­eral had al­ready de­clined to do so. As for the AGC state­ment, it said it “might rea­son­ably have been con­strued as in­tim­i­dat­ing”, but there was no breach of right to coun­sel.</p>
