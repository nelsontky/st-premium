    <p>As some­one who en­joys cook­ing, Mr Ravi Kant had al­ways dreamed of open­ing a small cafe. He made a start last month, a de­but that arose, how­ever, from a night­mare.</p>
    <p>The for­mer travel com­pany ex­ec­u­tive was laid off in March af­ter the coro­n­avirus pan­demic abruptly closed bor­ders, halt­ing the ar­rival of for­eign tourists. His monthly earn­ings of 65,000 ru­pees (S$1,200) evap­o­rated.</p>
    <p>He dipped into his sav­ings for a few months but the fi­nan­cial chal­lenges rapidly mul­ti­plied. He could not pay the school fees of his two chil­dren and be­gan de­fault­ing on re­pay­ments for loans he had taken out to help pay for his sick par­ents’ med­i­cal bills.</p>
    <p>Mr Kant, 38, fig­ured that when the go­ing gets tough, he had to get cook­ing. Last month, he set up a food stall at his neigh­bour­hood mar­ket­place in Noida, a Delhi sub­urb.</p>
    <p>It sells mostly burg­ers, sand­wiches and bev­er­ages.</p>
    <p>“I had to start some­thing be­cause I could not af­ford to be sit­ting at home any longer do­ing noth­ing,” Mr Kant told The Straits Times last Tues­day as he bus­ied him­self chop­ping mint leaves for an or­der of vir­gin mo­ji­tos.</p>
    <p>There was no time to spare that day; even his 12-year-old daugh­ter Navya had to pitch in, by fer­ry­ing items from their home nearby.</p>
    <p>The day be­fore had been es­pe­cially busy for Mr Kant – the num­ber of cus­tomers jumped from a daily av­er­age of 15 to more than 50.</p>
    <p>This pop­u­lar­ity boost came af­ter news agency ANI tweeted about his story of re­silience and in­cluded the stall’s lo­ca­tion. The tweet was quickly shared on­line by many oth­ers, prompt­ing an out­pour­ing of sup­port from those keen to lend street food ven­dors like him a help­ing hand.</p>
    <p>“It was crazy. I had never ex­pe­ri­enced such a crowd be­fore,” Mr Kant said.</p>
    <p>The crowds are still com­ing and have been sur­pass­ing 40 for the last few days. “This is my dream,” he added. “Ide­ally, I would never have started like this but my dream, my pas­sion has be­gun. So, I am not go­ing to stop this.”</p>
    <p>Among the cus­tomers last Tues­day was Mr Tarun Khera, 28, and his friend. They waited pa­tiently for more than 45 min­utes for their or­der of sand­wiches as Mr Kant strug­gled to cope with the slew of or­ders.</p>
    <p>Mr Khera said he and his friend had turned up af­ter see­ing a video on Face­book fea­tur­ing Mr Kant.</p>
    <p>“I thought I, too, could give him a help­ing hand. It doesn’t mat­ter if I have to wait longer than usual,” Mr Khera said. “I will cer­tainly come back if I like the food and even rec­om­mend him to oth­ers.”</p>
    <p>In the past fort­night, other strug­gling street food ven­dors have also re­lied on so­cial me­dia to ad­ver­tise their busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Even pop­u­lar Bol­ly­wood celebritie­s have pitched in, draw­ing cus­tomers with their in­flu­en­tial reach.</p>
    <p>The most pop­u­lar case is that of Baba Ka Dhaba, a road­side eatery run by an old cou­ple in Delhi. It saw sales surge overnight ear­lier this month af­ter a video fea­tur­ing its tear­ful owner went vi­ral.</p>
    <p>Zo­mato, an on­line food de­liv­ery start-up, even listed the eatery on its plat­form.</p>
    <p>The hash­tag #BabaKaDhab­a con­tin­ues to spawn sim­i­lar on­line at­tempts to re­ju­ve­nate street food stalls across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>FRESH START</p>
    <p>A ven­dor in Agra, who sells lentil frit­ters dipped in a fer­mented spicy drink known as kanji vada, also ben­e­fited from such a cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Even rep­re­sen­ta­tives from the lo­cal ad­min­is­tra­tion have queued up to buy the frit­ters.</p>
    <p>These street food ven­dors are, how­ever, the lucky ones.</p>
    <p>Mil­lions of oth­ers con­tinue to suf­fer from stag­nant de­mand as the pan­demic keeps cus­tomers away.</p>
    <p>Mr Mo­hammed Ashik, the owner of a chicken tikka stall near Mr Kant’s joint, said foot­fall re­mains at just around 10 per cent of pre-pan­demic lev­els.</p>
    <p>“Some­one should make a video on us too,” he lamented.</p>
    <p>Street food ven­dors be­gan set­ting up their stalls again in June fol­low­ing the grad­ual re­lax­ation of a strict lock­down that was im­posed in March. The fed­eral gov­ern­ment an­nounced a 10,000ru­pee loan scheme in May for street ven­dors to help them restart their busi­ness.</p>
    <p>How­ever, ac­cord­ing to es­ti­mates from the Na­tional As­so­ci­a­tion of Street Ven­dors of In­dia (Nasvi), only around half of the coun­try’s 33 mil­lion street food ven­dors have re­sumed busi­ness so far.</p>
    <p>“Many re­main re­luc­tant to start their busi­ness be­cause they fear cus­tomers may not come, which could force them to throw away their per­ish­able items at the end of the day,” Ms Sangeeta Singh, head of the street food pro­gramme at Nasvi, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, Nasvi ini­ti­ated a #BringThemB­ack cam­paign and has so far raised around 725,000 ru­pees of its tar­geted one mil­lion ru­pees to help street food ven­dors adopt bet­ter san­i­tary pro­to­cols to en­cour­age the pub­lic to buy food from them.</p>
    <p>The as­so­ci­a­tion is also dis­tribut­ing “Covid kits” to food ven­dors, which com­prise items such as sani­tiser, masks, caps, gloves and aprons.</p>
    <p>Ms Singh said: “But there still is a com­po­nent of in­se­cu­rity as many don’t have the re­quired fi­nan­cial cap­i­tal any more, hav­ing ex­hausted it to sur­vive dur­ing the lock­down.</p>
    <p>“Nei­ther do they want to get into the risk of tak­ing loans when they re­main un­sure about sup­port from cus­tomers.”</p>
    <p>I had to start some­thing be­cause I could not af­ford to be sit­ting at home any longer do­ing noth­ing.</p>
