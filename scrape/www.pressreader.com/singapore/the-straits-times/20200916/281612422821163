    <p>Build­ing a safer online space for Sin­ga­pore­ans is not about strict polic­ing of the dig­i­tal world. It is about mak­ing sure that peo­ple recog­nise the red flags and know where to turn to for help, Min­is­ter of State in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice Tan Kiat How said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Build­ing a safer online space for Sin­ga­pore­ans is not about strict polic­ing of the dig­i­tal world.</p>
    <p>It is about mak­ing sure that peo­ple recog­nise the red flags and know where to turn to for help, said Min­is­ter of State in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice Tan Kiat How yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The ap­proach in­cludes pro­tect­ing peo­ple from child pornog­ra­phy, online bul­ly­ing and cy­ber­scams, and it has be­come more ur­gent to­day, as young peo­ple are spend­ing more time online and se­niors are start­ing to learn dig­i­tal skills, he added.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing dur­ing an in­ter­view with Money FM 89.3’s Cla­ressa Mon­teiro, Mr Tan said: “Hav­ing a safer online com­mu­nity is not about con­trol; it’s not about over­sight. It’s about all par­ties com­ing to­gether to do (their) part.”</p>
    <p>This means in­volv­ing both the Gov­ern­ment and the pri­vate sec­tor, as well as schools and young peo­ple, he added.</p>
    <p>In Par­lia­ment ear­lier this month, Mr Tan mooted the idea of hav­ing a sin­gle gov­ern­ment agency to tackle these is­sues, which are now han­dled by mul­ti­ple or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>He noted that coun­tries such as Aus­tralia and New Zealand have set up one-stop cen­tres for vic­tims of online crime.</p>
    <p>“Vic­tims of­ten feel they are alone and have no one to turn to, and don’t know who to turn to.</p>
    <p>“That agency can pull to­gether re­sources to be a one-stop cen­tre for such vic­tims, and that ben­e­fits ev­ery­one.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the in­ter­view, he also spoke about his plans for gov­ern­ment feed­back unit Reach, which he now chairs.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old or­gan­i­sa­tion is work­ing to en­gage seg­ments of the pop­u­la­tion that may not have the skills or re­sources to proac­tively of­fer feed­back to their MPs, such as peo­ple liv­ing in rental flats and prison in­mates, he said.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery voice mat­ters to us in terms of think­ing about the fu­ture of the coun­try, and in terms of mak­ing de­ci­sions.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tan, who is also Min­is­ter of State for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment, was asked how of­ten he gets feed­back from as­pir­ing home own­ers on what they hope to see.</p>
    <p>Al­most ev­ery day, he replied. “It’s not just about giv­ing us feed­back on poli­cies or anx­i­eties or pain points in our lives,” he said.</p>
    <p>“In­creas­ingly, I’m get­ting many more very con­struc­tive and pos­i­tive sug­ges­tions – peo­ple who care enough to write the e-mail, care enough to say, I think some­thing can be im­proved.”</p>
    <p>HELP FOR CY­BER­CRIME VIC­TIMS</p>
    <p>Vic­tims of­ten feel they are alone and have no one to turn to, and don’t know who to turn to. That agency can pull to­gether re­sources to be a one-stop cen­tre for such vic­tims, and that ben­e­fits ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>MIN­IS­TER OF STATE IN THE PRIME MIN­IS­TER’S OF­FICE TAN KIAT HOW, on how hav­ing a gov­ern­ment agency to han­dle cy­ber­crime could help vic­tims.</p>
