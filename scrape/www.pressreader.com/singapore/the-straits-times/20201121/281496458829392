    <p>Hong Kong may be in the grip of a fourth Covid-19 wave fol­low­ing a spike in in­fec­tions, but the travel bub­ble with Sin­ga­pore, which is sched­uled to be launched to­mor­row, re­mains in­tact.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands the first few flights un­der a travel bub­ble ar­range­ment be­tween Hong Kong and Sin­ga­pore, an­nounced in mid-Oc­to­ber, are ex­pected to pro­ceed as planned for now.</p>
    <p>Un­der the deal, the travel bub­ble will be sus­pended for two weeks if the seven-day mov­ing av­er­age of the daily num­ber of un­linked lo­cal Covid-19 cases is more than five for ei­ther Sin­ga­pore or Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The lat­est mov­ing av­er­age for the ter­ri­tory is 2.14 based on a method used by both Hong Kong and Sin­ga­pore with data from the Cen­tre for Health Pro­tec­tion, sources told The Straits Times. The num­ber of in­fec­tions today will be cru­cial in de­ter­min­ing if the thresh­old is breached.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong Tourism Com­mis­sion, in a re­sponse to ST, said the travel bub­ble can be ad­justed any time by ei­ther in­creas­ing or re­duc­ing des­ig­nated flights, or sus­pend­ing them al­to­gether. If the thresh­old of five is breached, the travel bub­ble “will be sus­pended in two days’ time (in­clud­ing the day on which the fig­ure was an­nounced) for two weeks”.</p>
    <p>“The two gov­ern­ments will no­tify the air­lines and make the rel­e­vant an­nounce­ment,” it said, adding that if the fig­ure stayed un­der five for both cities on the last day of the sus­pen­sion, the travel bub­ble could re­sume the next day.</p>
    <p>The tourism com­mis­sion added that in the event of a sus­pen­sion of the bub­ble, Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens, per­ma­nent res­i­dents or long-term pass hold­ers can re­turn to Sin­ga­pore from Hong Kong by non-bub­ble flights, but they will be sub­ject to Sin­ga­pore quar­an­tine ar­range­ments such as seven-day stay-home no­tice.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong added 26 con­firmed cases yes­ter­day, of which 21 were lo­cal and the rest im­ported. This brings the tally of to­tal cases in the ter­ri­tory to 5,517 and 108 deaths.</p>
    <p>The new cases com­prised dif­fer­ent clus­ters, in­volv­ing taxi driv­ers, ho­tel stays and dance stu­dios, with the health au­thor­i­ties dis­clos­ing that pre­lim­i­nary tests found at least 40 peo­ple to be pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>“We are now do­ing our best and be­fore this se­vere sit­u­a­tion started, in the past week, we had al­ready tight­ened many of our mea­sures, in­clud­ing bor­der con­trol mea­sures, quar­an­tine mea­sures, ho­tel reg­u­la­tion mea­sures, and also some of the so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures,” Health Sec­re­tary Sophia Chan said yes­ter­day. She dis­closed that high-risk groups such as taxi driv­ers and nurs­ing home staff, as well as pa­tients who ex­hibit symp­toms sim­i­lar to Covid-19 when vis­it­ing doc­tors, must un­dergo test­ing for the virus.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, the gov­ern­ment moved to tighten so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules af­ter de­tect­ing clus­ters among cab­bies and at a Lan­tau re­sort. And in mea­sures that started on Mon­day and will last un­til Nov 26, dine-in ser­vices will end two hours ear­lier at mid­night, with pa­trons per table capped at four, down from six. In bars and pubs, that num­ber has been halved to two.</p>
    <p>Given the pop­u­lar­ity of stay­ca­tions as bor­ders re­main shut, of­fi­cials will soon im­pose a max­i­mum of four guests in each room at re­sorts, ho­tels and guest­houses – the same limit as pub­lic gath­er­ings in the ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the gov­ern­ment is deal­ing with an up­per res­pi­ra­tory tract in­fec­tion out­break in schools.</p>
    <p>Eight cases have been re­ported in eight pri­mary schools, and Pro­fes­sor Chan said yes­ter­day that from Mon­day, in-per­son classes for lower pri­mary school lev­els (Stan­dards 1 to 3) would be sus­pended for two weeks. She said classes at all schools may be can­celled if the sit­u­a­tion wors­ens.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion came just over a week af­ter kinder­gartens were or­dered to close for two weeks due to up­per res­pi­ra­tory tract in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>“As the trans­mis­sion routes of up­per res­pi­ra­tory tract in­fec­tions and Covid-19 are sim­i­lar, if Covid-19 spreads at schools, the risk posed to the com­mu­nity is very high,” Prof Chan said.</p>
