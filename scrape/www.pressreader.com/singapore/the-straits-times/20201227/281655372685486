    <p>The two men ar­rived car­ry­ing axes, bent on may­hem on a sun­shine morn­ing. In my mother’s gar­den in In­dia, an un­man­i­cured, leafy sanc­tu­ary amid the out­side din, two mango trees that leaned too far into the neigh­bour’s lane had to be pruned in late Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Branches were hacked, the wood slashed and great aw­ful stumps pro­truded where leaves once flut­tered in the wind. There was some­thing un­nat­u­ral and di­min­ished about it all, some­thing shorn and beaten up, just like this year it­self.</p>
    <p>And yet, it gave me an­other look at life. Like the com­fort­ing splash of blue sky that had been pre­vi­ously ob­scured by the fo­liage. John Mil­ton, be­fore he went blind, wrote about a “sil­ver lin­ing” and as hu­mans we’re hard­wired to want to see it, clutch­ing at these lit­tle of­fer­ings as if they are life­lines. Dur­ing dis­tress we’re thank­ful for this lin­ing be­cause we in­ter­pret it as hope.</p>
    <p>Of a thou­sand de­press­ing numbers this year, there was this: 400 mil­lion full-time jobs lost in the year’s sec­ond quar­ter. Fam­i­lies de­spaired, do­mes­tic vi­o­lence rose and how did labour­ers with no sav­ings even find their way through an­other week? Cru­elty seeped from the open wound that was 2020. Some­how we think a calendar page turned on Dec 31 will res­cue us. This is hope, too. Il­log­i­cal and ir­re­sistible.</p>
    <p>Shorts, a T-shirt, a desk – 2020 was a year stripped down to sim­plic­ity. Life lean and bare, re­mind­ing us that those full clos­ets are re­dun­dant. Sur­vival is a min­i­mal­ist ad­ven­ture and we emerge thank­ful for we know how lit­tle we re­ally need to ex­ist.</p>
    <p>Mod­esty was fash­ion­able again and in parts hu­mil­ity, too, for a mi­cro­scopic virus had punc­tured hu­man ar­ro­gance. Well, not ev­ery­one’s, right, Don­ald? As the planet re­paired it­self as we left it alone, we won­dered how we had con­sumed it. For ev­ery such dis­cov­ery, there is grate­ful­ness.</p>
    <p>We’re thank­ful for nurses who never paused in a year in which we had to. Billy Joel told us long ago to “slow down”, to “take the phone off the hook and dis­ap­pear for a while”, but who could? But now, amid tragedy, we were of­fered time, a sort of forced in­ter­mis­sion, when for a while we had to aban­don all the dis­trac­tions of the out­side world. No movies, bars, mu­se­ums, shops, just our­selves.</p>
    <p>In a busy and yet slowed-down life at home, our do­mes­tic planet was in­spected, our in­ner worlds ex­plored, fam­i­lies forced to see each other more clearly, si­lence worn, luck con­sid­ered. It has been a rare ac­count­ing of our lives and if you’re alive and em­ployed then it adds up to priv­i­lege.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple learnt to chop and clean, and tiny vic­to­ries ac­cu­mu­lated. The virus was rewiring us. Book sales rose and old po­ets were re­cited anew, and even as we waited for vac­cines, we leaned on words. Ac­tors be­came our lib­er­a­tors and mu­si­cians on YouTube brought relief. Even in this city of com­merce, we were res­cued by artists.</p>
    <p>To be locked in was to re­mem­ber the spa­ces we have in this city. So much we take for granted – the scent of a flower, the skip of a chameleon – and we are ap­pre­cia­tive of this re­minder. Af­ter the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, I vis­ited the Sin­ga­pore Botanic Gar­dens and ev­ery tur­tle and plant was not just a com­fort but a re­minder of what we were fight­ing for. Life it­self.</p>
    <p>Even if we weren’t in­fected, we were af­fected. The virus in­vaded the mind, tak­ing us down av­enues of fear and boule­vards of doubt. We – in dif­fer­ent mea­sures – were scared, an­noyed, sus­pi­cious, un­sure, para­noid, de­pressed and yet, we’re here. There is, per­haps, more in us than we be­lieved we had. In the ru­ins of a year was found a glimpse of our­selves.</p>
    <p>We are grate­ful for the sci­en­tists who preached method not mir­a­cle and for the nos­tril swab­bers and lab tech­ni­cians whose dili­gence in a repet­i­tive job was life sav­ing. We learnt to re­spect those who dealt in data and ap­pre­ci­ated there is no al­ter­na­tive to facts. In a tur­bu­lent time, a cred­i­ble me­dia was like a light­house, guid­ing us to the safety of truth.</p>
    <p>We are thank­ful we live in Sin­ga­pore, for although we grum­bled and strug­gled and chafed some­times, we were mostly or­derly and faith­ful to the com­mon sense of masks. By wear­ing one, we were do­ing a most pow­er­ful thing – demon­strat­ing an act of good cit­i­zenry.</p>
    <p>We must mourn all that was lost this year, the lives gone and jobs taken, and stand as wit­ness to the in­equal­ity of life. Al­ways the less for­tu­nate count the high­est cost. And yet, it’s hu­man to want to sal­vage some­thing, like an old photo dis­cov­ered in­tact in the de­bris of a bush fire. And so we clutch at a story about less pol­luted rivers and won­der at our abil­ity to sud­denly hold co­her­ent con­ver­sa­tions on an­ti­bod­ies. Even the worst years must not be en­tirely wasted ones.</p>
    <p>The glass half-full line won’t work right now be­cause the level of morale on the planet seems lower. But we’re not empty yet, we’re fight­ing, we’re re­search­ing, in­vent­ing, solv­ing, we’re car­ry­ing hope and it gives us a rea­son to keep go­ing through un­cer­tain days.</p>
    <p>Some days I think of those mu­ti­lated trees and tell my­self they will grow again. Heal­ing takes years, but one day they will stretch out their new, crooked branches to­wards the sun. They will be changed and yet, whole again. And we, too, will be re­stored.</p>
