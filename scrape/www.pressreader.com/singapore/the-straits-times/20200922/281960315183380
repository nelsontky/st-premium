    <p>Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin has had a sur­pris­ing and wel­come boost. A na­tion­wide poll con­ducted in July and last month found that 69 per cent of Malaysians, in­clud­ing</p>
    <p>93 per cent of Malays, think he is do­ing a good job.</p>
    <p>This will re­in­force the pre­vail­ing nar­ra­tive that Tan Sri Muhyid­din would be well served by call­ing snap elec­tions to bol­ster his le­git­i­macy and se­cure a larger par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity. This sce­nario is sup­ported by the Prime Min­is­ter’s coali­tion part­ner Umno, which is all too ea­ger to head to the polls.</p>
    <p>And, at first blush, Mr Muhyid­din does ap­pear to be gird­ing him­self for a na­tional elec­tion. He has tasked his Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia (Ber­satu) to mo­bilise and be ready for polls at any mo­ment. Ne­go­ti­a­tions on seat al­lo­ca­tions be­tween Ber­satu, Umno and the Is­lamist Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS) are un­der way. And next year’s bud­get will be tabled on</p>
    <p>Nov 6. Chock-full of stim­u­lus mea­sures and wel­fare pay­ments to key in­ter­est groups such as civil ser­vants, pen­sion­ers and farm­ers, it will be in­dis­tin­guish­able from an elec­tion bud­get.</p>
    <p>While this will el­e­vate spec­u­la­tion about an im­pend­ing snap elec­tion to fever pitch, Mr Muhyid­din may be bet­ter served by mak­ing haste slowly. While he is the Prime Min­is­ter and Ber­satu mem­bers hold many – if not most – key Cab­i­net po­si­tions, his po­si­tion at the head of the rul­ing coali­tion is pre­car­i­ous at best.</p>
    <p>This can be seen in the power bal­ance be­tween the three Malay-based par­ties. At present, Ber­satu has 31 MPs, Umno has 39, and PAS, 18. Go­ing by con­ven­tion, the party with the most MPs nom­i­nates the prime min­is­te­rial can­di­date.</p>
    <p>UMNO THE FRENEMY</p>
    <p>Umno is con­fi­dent it has the grass­roots ma­chin­ery and pres­tige to re­claim more seats. Its mem­bers fre­quently ques­tion whether Mr Muhyid­din should be prime min­is­ter, and party lead­ers of­ten state that the cur­rent ar­range­ment is but tem­po­rary.</p>
    <p>Most notably, Umno has re­fused to join the Ber­satu-led Perikatan Na­sional (PN) coali­tion, but has (grudg­ingly) let Ber­satu join Muafakat Na­sional, the Malay-only group­ing that also brings to­gether Umno and PAS.</p>
    <p>While seat-shar­ing ne­go­ti­a­tions be­tween the three par­ties are un­der way, there is no guar­an­tee that they will suc­ceed or be hon­oured in the breach. There are in­di­ca­tions that re­la­tions be­tween Ber­satu and Umno at the grass­roots are par­lous.</p>
    <p>If to­day’s coali­tion is un­sta­ble,</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din’s po­si­tion will only be weak­ened fol­low­ing elec­tions. The rea­son is that it is a near-cer­tainty that Ber­satu’s cur­rent crop of MPs will be sub­stan­tially thinned out. This would be the case in the event of a suc­cess­ful seat al­lo­ca­tion strat­egy that avoids di­rect con­tests be­tween Ber­satu on the one hand, and Umno or PAS on the other.</p>
    <p>How­ever, should Ber­satu need to con­test against these two par­ties – which can­not be ex­cluded – the sit­u­a­tion fac­ing it would be even more dire.</p>
    <p>This can be seen when we an­a­lyse the elec­toral vi­a­bil­ity of the dif­fer­ent groups in Ber­satu.</p>
    <p>WHO IS LIKELY TO FALL</p>
    <p>The first group con­sists of the “found­ing fa­thers” who have been with the party since its es­tab­lish­ment and con­tested un­der its ban­ner in the 2018 Gen­eral Elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Ini­tially com­pris­ing 13 MPs, this fac­tion is down to six and com­prises Mr Muhyid­din as well as the likes of Mr Ah­mad Faizal Azumu, MP for Tam­bun and Men­teri Be­sar of Perak. MPs in this group are in Malay-ma­jor­ity con­stituen­cies and should fare rel­a­tively well in any sub­se­quent elec­tion – par­tic­u­larly if they do not run against Umno or PAS can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond group com­prises for­mer Umno MPs from Penin­su­lar Malaysia who sub­se­quently joined Ber­satu af­ter 2018. There are 10 MPs in this group, which in­cludes the likes of Mr Mustapa Mo­hamed, Min­is­ter for the Econ­omy and MP for Jeli in Ke­lan­tan, and Mr Hamzah</p>
    <p>Zain­ud­din, Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter and MP for Larut in Perak.</p>
    <p>These par­lia­men­tar­i­ans uni­formly hail from ru­ral su­per Malay-ma­jor­ity con­stituen­cies, where Malays make up 75 per cent or more of vot­ers. As long as they do not have to run against Umno can­di­dates, these Ber­satu MPs are in a good po­si­tion to be re-elected.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the same can­not be said for the other two groups, which make up the re­main­ing half of Ber­satu’s MPs.</p>
    <p>The first is the fac­tion led by for­mer Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat vice-pres­i­dent Azmin Ali. These 10 MPs are largely based in mixed seats, many of which are ur­ban or semi-ur­ban. These can­di­dates ran on a re­form agenda as­so­ci­ated with the re­cently ousted Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) and are in seats that have a tra­di­tion of vot­ing for the op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, some mem­bers of this group, such as Min­is­ter for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and Mul­ti­me­dia Sai­fud­din Ab­dul­lah and Deputy Min­is­ter for Foreign Af­fairs Ka­marudin Jaf­far, ran in their con­stituency for the first time only in 2018. Thus, they have not had the time to build up a net­work of peo­ple in their con­stituency loyal to them. In any elec­tion, this group will be ex­cep­tion­ally vul­ner­a­ble to chal­lenges from PH con­tes­tants.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal group con­sists of five for­mer Umno MPs from Sabah who, like their penin­su­lar coun­ter­parts, also crossed over af­ter the 2018 rout. These par­lia­men­tar­i­ans hail from bu­mi­put­era (but not Malay)-ma­jor­ity seats. With the ex­cep­tion of Agri­cul­ture and Food In­dus­tries Min­is­ter Ron­ald Kiandee, who is es­tab­lished in his con­stituency and se­cured a solid ma­jor­ity, the re­main­der won nar­rowly against Parti Warisan Sabah or PH can­di­dates in 2018.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, Mr Ya­mani Hafez Musa and Mr Zakaria Idris, the MPs for Sip­i­tang and Libaran, re­spec­tively, won by fewer than 1,000 votes. This time around, their as­so­ci­a­tion with Muafakat Na­sional may cost them ad­di­tional votes. In­deed, a re­cent state­ment by PAS MP Nik Muham­mad Zawawi Salleh claim­ing that the Bi­ble was dis­torted has pro­voked an up­roar among Chris­tians – a key in­ter­est group in Sabah.</p>
    <p>Thus, Mr Muhyid­din faces the very real pos­si­bil­ity that his crop of MPs would be halved in the event of snap elec­tions. And, should Umno ride the cur­rent anx­i­ety over Malay rights and pre­rog­a­tives, it is likely to sub­stan­tially in­crease the ranks of its own MPs. Should this hap­pen, Umno would be in a po­si­tion to de­mand the prime min­is­ter­ship or, at the very least, make Mr Muhyid­din a fig­ure­head – sub­ject to its ev­ery whim and de­mand.</p>
    <p>It is pos­si­ble, how­ever, that Umno could exit the rul­ing coali­tion should the wait be too long.</p>
    <p>While this would de­prive PN of its par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity, there is cur­rently no agree­ment on who Umno’s prime min­is­te­rial can­di­date would be. At present, there are no fewer than four fac­tions seek­ing con­trol of the party.</p>
    <p>For­mer PM Na­jib Razak and Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi each have their own fac­tions, for­mer Umno vice-pres­i­dent and po­lit­i­cal blue blood Hisham­mud­din Hus­sein has his, and there is a loose group of mod­er­ates com­pris­ing the likes of Mr Khairy Ja­malud­din, Umno deputy pres­i­dent Mo­hamad Hasan and for­mer Jo­hor men­teri be­sar Mo­hamed Khaled Nordin.</p>
    <p>MUHYID­DIN’S OP­TIONS</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, faced with the loss of his par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity, Mr Muhyid­din may be per­suaded to reach across the aisle to his erst­while al­lies in PH – who, like him, are in no rush to head to elec­tions.</p>
    <p>This would be no for­mal coali­tion but rather, a power-shar­ing ar­range­ment. Re­cent state­ments by the Demo­cratic Action Party’s An­thony Loke about a cease­fire with the PN ad­min­is­tra­tion have al­luded to this pos­si­bil­ity. An un­likely sce­nario, yes, but stranger things have hap­pened in Malaysian pol­i­tics – par­tic­u­larly of late.</p>
    <p>Thus, rather than rush­ing head­long to­wards snap polls, it is more likely that we will see a sit­u­a­tion akin to the lead-up to the 14th Gen­eral Elec­tion un­der Na­jib. This was a long and drawn-out af­fair, punc­tu­ated by al­ter­nat­ing pe­ri­ods of mo­bil­i­sa­tion and rest that lasted some 18 months.</p>
    <p>In Mr Muhyid­din’s case, this tac­tic will be used to di­vert at­ten­tion from mea­sures such as leg­is­la­tion aimed at strength­en­ing his po­si­tion and over­tures to en­tice more par­lia­men­tar­i­ans to join his party.</p>
    <p>Should even a hand­ful cross over, this will in­crease Mr Muhyid­din’s strength rel­a­tive to Umno and buy him more time. Thus, the wait for Malaysia’s next par­lia­men­tary elec­tions may prove to be longer rather than shorter.</p>
