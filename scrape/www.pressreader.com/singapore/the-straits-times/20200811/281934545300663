    <p>MINSK • At least one per­son was killed af­ter be­ing knocked over by a po­lice pris­oner van and dozens were in­jured in clashes be­tween po­lice and protesters af­ter the Belarus pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, a rep­re­sen­ta­tive of rights group Spring 96 said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“There are at least 120 de­tainees, but this is ini­tial data,” the rep­re­sen­ta­tive, Mr Valentin Ste­fanovic, also told Reuters.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of peo­ple took to the streets on Sun­day in protest af­ter strong­man Pres­i­dent Alexan­der Lukashenko looked set to win a sixth term in an elec­tion that his op­po­nents say was rigged in his favour.</p>
    <p>Mr Lukashenko, 65, has ruled Belarus since 1994, cast­ing him­self as a guar­an­tor of sta­bil­ity, say­ing that the state looks af­ter most of its 9.5 mil­lion peo­ple’s needs in the same way that the Soviet Union did.</p>
    <p>Be­laru­sian opposition can­di­date Svet­lana Tikhanousk­aya yes­ter­day re­jected the of­fi­cial elec­tion re­sults, say­ing the vote was rigged and that the protests that had turned bloody on Sun­day would con­tinue.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral elec­tion com­mis­sion had ear­lier said that Mr Lukashenko won 80 per cent of the vote, while Ms Tikhanousk­aya, a former English teacher who emerged from ob­scu­rity to be­come his main ri­val, took just 9.9 per cent.</p>
    <p>For­eign ob­servers have not judged an elec­tion to be free and fair in Belarus since 1995, and the run-up to the vote saw the au­thor­i­ties jail Mr Lukashenko’s ri­vals and open crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions into oth­ers who voiced opposition.</p>
    <p>The streets were quiet in the cap­i­tal Minsk and other cities yes­ter­day, af­ter vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>Ms Tikhanousk­aya, who en­tered the race af­ter her blog­ger hus­band, who in­tended to run, was jailed, told re­porters in Minsk that she con­sid­ered her­self the elec­tion win­ner. She said the elec­tion had been mas­sively rigged.</p>
    <p>Her aides said the opposition wanted a vote re­count at polling sta­tions where there were prob­lems. They also said the opposition wanted to hold talks with the au­thor­i­ties about how to bring about a peace­ful change of power.</p>
