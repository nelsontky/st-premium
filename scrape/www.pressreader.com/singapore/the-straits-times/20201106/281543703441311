    <p>While the Hous­ing Board re­sale flat vol­ume dipped last month from Septem­ber, prices con­tin­ued to rise for the fourth con­sec­u­tive</p>
    <p>month, in­di­cat­ing that de­mand re­mained rel­a­tively robust amid the pan­demic. There were a to­tal of 2,436 HDB re­sale trans­ac­tions last month, down by 2.1 per cent from Septem­ber. Thir­teen of these flats went for more than $1 mil­lion, mak­ing up 0.5 per cent of the to­tal re­sale trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>While the Hous­ing Board re­sale flat vol­ume dipped last month from Septem­ber, prices con­tin­ued to rise for the fourth con­sec­u­tive month, in­di­cat­ing that de­mand re­mained rel­a­tively robust amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>There were a to­tal of 2,436 HDB re­sale trans­ac­tions last month, down by 2.1 per cent from Septem­ber, ac­cord­ing to flash es­ti­mates re­leased by real es­tate por­tal SRX yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Thir­teen of these HDB re­sale flats went for more than $1 mil­lion, mak­ing up 0.5 per cent of the to­tal re­sale trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>This is the high­est-ever num­ber of such trans­ac­tions in a sin­gle month. The pre­vi­ous high was in June 2018 when 11 mil­lion-dol­lar flats changed hands.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 59 HDB re­sale flats have been sold for more than $1 mil­lion in the first 10 months of this year.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong Siew Ying, PropNex head of re­search and con­tent, said this year’s fig­ure looks set to sur­pass the 64 mil­lion-dol­lar deals recorded last year.</p>
    <p>Oc­to­ber was the fifth con­sec­u­tive month when sales vol­ume stayed above 2,400 units, af­ter re­bound­ing from the weak mar­ket dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Over­all prices for HDB re­sale flats rose by 1.2 per cent last month over Septem­ber, for the fourth suc­ces­sive month.</p>
    <p>Ms Christine Sun, head of Or­ange Tee & Tie’s re­search and con­sul­tancy, said l arge re­sale flats, es­pe­cially those in good lo­ca­tions, were in de­mand over the past few months.</p>
    <p>“This is not sur­pris­ing as some fam­i­lies pre­fer to buy re­sale flats dur­ing a cri­sis, since peo­ple tend to be more pru­dent. For the same price, they can pur­chase a much big­ger flat as com­pared with a pri­vate home,” she said.</p>
    <p>She noted that singles mov­ing out of their fam­ily homes to live on their own may have also con­trib­uted to the de­mand, as the work­from-home ar­range­ment looks likely to con­tinue into phase three for some com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong, not­ing that the ask­ing prices of HDB re­sale flats have risen in re­cent months due to strong de­mand and higher sales vol­ume, said: “In many cases, the agreed sell­ing price is higher than the mar­ket val­u­a­tion of the unit and the buy­ers have had to pay the dif­fer­ence in cash.”</p>
    <p>Last month, a five-room De­sign, Build and Sell Scheme flat at Natura Loft in Bis­han fetched the high­est trans­acted price at $1,208,000, while an ex­ec­u­tive maisonette flat in Jurong East was sold for $820,000, in what was the high­est re­sale price for non-ma­ture es­tates.</p>
    <p>ERA Realty head of re­search and con­sul­tancy Ni­cholas Mak pro­jected that the HDB re­sale vol­ume for this year could vary be­tween 23,500 and 24,800 flats, sur­pass­ing the 23,714 trans­ac­tions last year.</p>
    <p>“With a more ac­tive re­sale mar­ket, the HDB re­sale price in­dex could also edge up­wards to end the year with a 2.5 to 3.5 per cent yearon-year in­crease,” he said.</p>
