    <p>A Sin­ga­porean man who works at Crowne Plaza Changi Air­port’s Azur restau­rant was among the two com­mu­nity cases linked to pre­vi­ous cases an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>There were also 21 im­ported cases con­firmed by the Min­istry of Health (MOH), tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,836.</p>
    <p>The 20-year-old Sin­ga­porean is the third con­firmed case at Azur.</p>
    <p>He has tested pre­lim­i­nar­ily pos­i­tive for the more i nfec­tious Bri­tish strain of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>He de­liv­ers pre-packed meals to air crew and ho­tel guests, and did not in­ter­act with din­ers at Azur.</p>
    <p>His ear­lier tests from rostered rou­tine test­ing – the last be­ing on Jan 1 – were neg­a­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean had been iden­ti­fied as a close con­tact of the Korean work per­mit holder re­ported on Wed­nes­day and had been placed on quar­an­tine on Tues­day at a quar­an­tine fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>He de­vel­oped symp­toms on Thurs­day, and was swabbed the same day.</p>
    <p>His test came back pos­i­tive for Covid-19, and he was taken to the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases in an am­bu­lance.</p>
    <p>His sero­log­i­cal test re­sult came back neg­a­tive, in­di­cat­ing that this was likely a cur­rent in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Spe­cial test­ing op­er­a­tions at the ho­tel are un­der way, and 233 staff have been swabbed, said MOH. Of these, 129 test re­sults are neg­a­tive, and 104 test re­sults are pend­ing.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond com­mu­nity case is a 34-year-old har­bour pi­lot at PSA Marine and the fifth case to be linked to the Sin­ga­porean har­bour pi­lot who was con­firmed to have Covid-19 on Dec 30.</p>
    <p>He was placed on quar­an­tine on Jan 1 at a quar­an­tine fa­cil­ity af­ter be­ing iden­ti­fied as a close con­tact.</p>
    <p>His swab on Sun­day was neg­a­tive for Covid-19, but an­other test taken on Thurs­day came back pos­i­tive for the in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean man was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal in an am­bu­lance. He de­vel­oped symp­toms yes­ter­day, and his sero­log­i­cal test re­sult is pend­ing.</p>
    <p>Tampines Mall and Gochi-So Shokudo restau­rant at Tampines 1 were added to the list of places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were still in­fec­tious, added MOH.</p>
    <p>With 18 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,565 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
