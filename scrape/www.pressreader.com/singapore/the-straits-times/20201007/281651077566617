    <p>Jour­nal­ists and cu­ri­ous in­di­vid­u­als packed the pub­lic gallery yes­ter­day as Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong took the stand to be cros­sex­am­ined in his defama­tion case against blog­ger Leong Sze Hian.</p>
    <p>For three hours, PM Lee was ques­tioned by Mr Leong’s lawyer, op­po­si­tion politi­cian Lim Tean, who was fo­cused on the is­sues he wanted to ex­am­ine.</p>
    <p>But this saw PM Lee field­ing the same hand­ful of ques­tions over and over through­out the ses­sion.</p>
    <p>The ex­changes ended sev­eral times with the par­ties talk­ing over each other, with Mr Lim drown­ing out the re­peated ob­jec­tions of Senior Coun­sel Davin­der Singh, who led PM Lee’s team of lawyers.</p>
    <p>“He comes pro­tect­ing his client, who is sup­posed to be the most pow­er­ful man in Sin­ga­pore po­lit­i­cally, and he’s mol­ly­cod­dling him,” said Mr Lim at one point.</p>
    <p>Justice Aedit Ab­dul­lah had to step in sev­eral times, help­ing to guide the cross-ex­am­i­na­tion and re­mind­ing Mr Lim to be spe­cific in his ques­tions and to keep them within the scope of the case be­fore the court.</p>
    <p>At one point, Mr Singh stood up for the umpteenth time to raise an ob­jec­tion while Mr Lim was at­tempt­ing to ques­tion PM Lee on his in­volve­ment in var­i­ous gov­ern­ment pro­cesses, and Justice Aedit said: “Mr Singh doesn’t even have to stand for this. Mr Lim, you are go­ing be­yond the re­mit. I have given my di­rec­tion.”</p>
    <p>With safe dis­tanc­ing rules still in place ow­ing to the Covid-19 pan­demic, only 20 mem­bers of the pub­lic were al­lowed into the pub­lic gallery at any one time.</p>
    <p>Those who man­aged to se­cure a place were in­structed to leave one empty seat in be­tween them.</p>
    <p>There were only about 50 peo­ple in the court­room in to­tal, in­clud­ing re­porters, the lawyers and se­cu­rity of­fi­cers. Court­room 4B can typ­i­cally take al­most dou­ble that num­ber.</p>
    <p>The day had started early for those who wanted to at­tend the hear­ing, with a queue form­ing from about 5am.</p>
    <p>First in line was The On­line Cit­i­zen chief editor Terry Xu, who is him­self be­ing sued by PM Lee for defama­tion over an ar­ti­cle in which he re­peated al­le­ga­tions about PM Lee in re­la­tion to his late father Lee Kuan Yew’s fam­ily home in Ox­ley Road.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers who had turned up early in­cluded res­i­dents from PM Lee’s Teck Ghee con­stituency as well as sup­port­ers of Mr Leong.</p>
    <p>The lim­ited spa­ces, as well as pub­lic in­ter­est in the case, meant that many who turned up were not able to go into the court­room.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial con­sul­tant Ray­mond Giam, 57, who had set off early from his home in Bukit Timah and joined the queue at 6.30am, just missed his chance to en­ter the court­room. He was No. 23 in line and did not re­ceive a ticket when they were given out at 7am.</p>
    <p>“I en­joy the cut and thrust of de­bate and I thought it would be in­ter­est­ing, given the peo­ple in­volved,” he said.</p>
    <p>Also un­able to en­ter was med­i­cal ad­min­is­tra­tor Michael Fang, 43, who posed for a group photo with Mr Leong.</p>
    <p>Mr Fang was a Peo­ples Voice party can­di­date for Jalan Be­sar GRC dur­ing the gen­eral elec­tion in July, and the slate led by Mr Lim had also in­cluded Mr Leong.</p>
    <p>Mr Fang said the case had gen­er­ated a lot of pub­lic in­ter­est and he hoped “to see a good out­come”.</p>
