    <p>As a former teacher who had taught Nor­mal (Tech­ni­cal) stream stu­dents, Dr In­tan Azura Mokhtar was pained to see how such aca­demic la­bels dealt a blow to her stu­dents’ self-be­lief.</p>
    <p>“With suf­fi­cient mo­ti­va­tion and op­por­tu­ni­ties to prove them­selves, they did well and could re­alise their true po­ten­tial. I did not like how aca­demic stream­ing tends to pi­geon­hole the abil­i­ties and po­ten­tial of stu­dents,” said Dr In­tan, 44, who was an Ang Mo Kio GRC MP for two terms.</p>
    <p>Since en­ter­ing pol­i­tics in 2011, Dr In­tan, who was on the Gov­ern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee for Ed­u­ca­tion, has re­lent­lessly spo­ken about the need to do away with aca­demic stream­ing, both in Par­lia­ment and in pri­vate meet­ings with of­fice-hold­ers from the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE).</p>
    <p>Much progress has been made in this area, after var­i­ous groups weighed in. Last year, the MOE an­nounced plans to phase out stream­ing. By 2024, full sub­ject­based band­ing will be rolled out to all sec­ondary schools, al­low­ing stu­dents, based on their strengths, to study more sub­jects at a higher or lower level.</p>
    <p>See­ing such policy changes ma­te­ri­alise has been a sat­is­fy­ing as­pect of her time as MP, said Dr In­tan, who noted that this does not al­ways hap­pen. For ex­am­ple, she had pro­posed that Spe­cial As­sis­tance Plan schools also ad­mit stu­dents who do not take Chi­nese as a mother tongue, in the spirit of greater in­clu­siv­ity. The sug­ges­tion has not been taken up.</p>
    <p>Dr In­tan said it has been “mean­ing­ful and mem­o­rable” to make a dif­fer­ence to the lives of res­i­dents in her Jalan Kayu ward through so­cial or fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance schemes or es­tate im­prove­ment.</p>
    <p>But there have been ob­sta­cles, too, such as res­i­dents fac­ing multi-faceted chal­lenges that are more dif­fi­cult to re­solve.</p>
    <p>“It was not easy,” Dr In­tan said. “I could feel their ex­as­per­a­tion and bur­den, and I wished I could solve their prob­lems and alle­vi­ate their bur­dens as soon as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>The as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor in Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Technology’s de­sign and spe­cialised busi­ness clus­ter will con­tinue to work on her aca­demic projects. She has also been do­ing pro bono work for a foun­da­tion in In­done­sia that pro­vides em­ploy­a­bil­ity train­ing to In­done­sian youth, and hopes to spend more time on this.</p>
    <p>Look­ing back on her nine years in pol­i­tics, Dr In­tan said she has learnt much. “I would like to be­lieve I am wiser, more em­pa­thetic, more grounded, and some­one who has a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing... of pub­lic policy, as well as policy as­pi­ra­tions, con­sid­er­a­tions and trade-offs. (I have) no re­grets.”</p>
