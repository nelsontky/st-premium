    <p>Trou­bled Hin Leong Trad­ing founder Lim Oon Kuin is no longer in the man­age­ment team of shipowner Xihe Group, which is be­ing brought un­der ju­di­cial man­age­ment by cred­i­tor OCBC Bank.</p>
    <p>His chil­dren, Mr Evan Lim Chee Meng and Ms Lim Huey Ching, will also be step­ping down as di­rec­tors, ac­cord­ing to Mr Kenny Lim Oon Cheng, the new in­terim chief ex­ec­u­tive of Xihe.</p>
    <p>A new man­age­ment team which in­cludes Mr Kenny Lim, who is Mr Lim Oon Kuin’s younger brother, has been put in place. A new board of di­rec­tors – con­sist­ing of a ma­jor­ity of non-ex­ec­u­tive in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tors – is be­ing fi­nalised as part of a con­sen­sual re­struc­tur­ing with Xihe’s 12 len­ders, the com­pany said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Xihe is fight­ing an ap­pli­ca­tion filed last week by OCBC to have the High Court ap­point ju­di­cial man­agers for the com­pany, which is owned by Mr Lim’s fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Among rea­sons cited, OCBC said it “strongly dis­trusts cur­rent man­age­ment” after US$208.1 mil­lion (S$286.5 mil­lion) was trans­ferred by the Xihe group to trou­bled oil trader Hin Leong “for no valid com­mer­cial pur­pose”.</p>
    <p>But Mr Kenny Lim, in a July 28 af­fi­davit, said the ap­pli­ca­tion will “dis­rupt the con­struc­tive dis­cus­sions Xihe has had with third par­ties... and threat­ens to de­rail the... prospect of a re­struc­tur­ing which will cre­ate more value for (its) len­ders.” Fur­ther, he said, the US$208.1 mil­lion trans­fer was an “in­ter­com­pany loan to Ocean Tankers in the or­di­nary course of busi­ness. There was no pro­hi­bi­tion on such in­ter­com­pany lend­ing”.</p>
    <p>Other mem­bers of the new man­age­ment team in­clude com­mer­cial di­rec­tor Des­mond Chong, sales and pur­chase di­rec­tor Michael Tan and vice-pres­i­dent (fleet man­age­ment) Zhang Yu­jie.</p>
    <p>Mr Kenny Lim, who is in his 60s, said in the af­fi­davit he is not a share­holder of Hin Leong, or a di­rec­tor in any com­pany in the Xihe group.</p>
    <p>Xihe said it has ter­mi­nated a num­ber of bare­boat char­ter con­tracts with Ocean Tankers and Hin Leong, and is work­ing with their in­terim ju­di­cial man­agers to seek re­de­liv­ery of those ves­sels.</p>
    <p>“As at July 27, the Xihe group ter­mi­nated 46 bare­boat char­ter agree­ments and asked for re­de­liv­ery of 46 ves­sels. How­ever, only 2 ves­sels have been re­de­liv­ered,” Mr Kenny Lim said in his af­fi­davit.</p>
    <p>As at July 22, the group com­prises 77 firms, of which 64 are ves­sel-own­ing units that own 136 ves­sels. The group has sold four ves­sels and is in dis­cus­sions to sell more.</p>
