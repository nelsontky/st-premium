    <p>A study of the man­age­ment boards of char­i­ties has found that greater di­ver­sity of board mem­bers shows bet­ter fi­nan­cial per­for­mance for the char­ity. The study col­lected data on the board com­po­si­tion and fi­nan­cial per­for­mance met­rics of 204 In­sti­tu­tions of a Public Char­ac­ter, or IPCs – char­i­ties that are al­lowed to col­lect tax-de­ductible do­na­tions.</p>
    <p>Per­cent­age of Malays who sit on the man­age­ment boards of char­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore, ac­cord­ing to a Con­junct Con­sult­ing study. It also found that women com­prised a third of the boards stud­ied.</p>
    <p>A study of the man­age­ment boards of char­i­ties has found that greater di­ver­sity of board mem­bers shows bet­ter fi­nan­cial per­for­mance for the char­ity.</p>
    <p>The study by Con­junct Con­sult­ing, a char­ity that pro­vides con­sul­tancy ser­vices to char­i­ties and so­cial en­ter­prises, col­lected data on the board com­po­si­tion and fi­nan­cial per­for­mance met­rics of 204 In­sti­tu­tions of a Public Char­ac­ter, or IPCs – char­i­ties that are al­lowed to col­lect tax-de­ductible do­na­tions.</p>
    <p>It did the study as there was none done on board di­ver­sity and or­gan­i­sa­tional per­for­mance of char­i­ties here, said Con­junct’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Yas­mine Tan.</p>
    <p>The study fo­cused on fi­nan­cial in­di­ca­tors as IPCs span a range of sec­tors from the arts to so­cial ser­vices to sports, and it is hard to find other com­mon in­di­ca­tors to mea­sure or­gan­i­sa­tional per­for­mance or im­pact.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan said: “As board mem­bers are tasked with the cru­cial role of guid­ing the char­ity’s strat­egy and di­rec­tion, we be­lieve it is im­per­a­tive for the board to pos­sess a di­ver­sity of back­grounds, skills and ex­pe­ri­ence to guide the char­ity to­wards a sus­tain­able fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“A more di­verse board can in fact help char­i­ties to broaden their net­works to find other suit­able board mem­bers and to fund-raise bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>The study – pre­sented dur­ing a panel dis­cus­sion last month on board di­ver­sity of char­i­ties – found that:</p>
    <p>• Greater gen­der di­ver­sity is as­so­ci­ated with greater fi­nan­cial sus­tain­abil­ity, which is de­scribed as the char­ity’s abil­ity to build re­serves.</p>
    <p>• Greater eth­nic di­ver­sity is as­so­ci­ated with greater fi­nan­cial sus­tain­abil­ity and greater fi­nan­cial in­de­pen­dence, which is the abil­ity to gen­er­ate in­come other than that from grants and do­na­tions. This could in­clude in­come from ser­vices pro­vided and in­vest­ment re­turns.</p>
    <p>While it is hard to pin­point ex­act rea­sons why greater racial di­ver­sity is co-re­lated to greater fi­nan­cial sus­tain­abil­ity, Ms Tan said many stud­ies have found the ben­e­fits of more gen­der di­ver­sity, such as boost­ing a listed firm’s fi­nan­cial per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>On the state of di­ver­sity here, Con­junct found that women com­prised a third of the boards stud­ied. How­ever, di­ver­sity is “strik­ingly” lack­ing when it comes to eth­nic rep­re­sen­ta­tion. Over 80 per cent of board mem­bers are Chi­nese, while Malays ac­count for only 3 per cent even though they com­prise about 15 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Suhaimi Zainul-Abidin, a board mem­ber of the Coun­cil for Board Di­ver­sity and who was con­sulted for the study, said the lead­ers of char­i­ties and com­pa­nies tend to ask suit­able can­di­dates they know to serve as board mem­bers and many of their net­works may not have Malay mem­bers.</p>
    <p>The study also in­ter­viewed 1,000 re­spon­dents to find out how board di­ver­sity im­pacts their giv­ing de­ci­sions, among other things.</p>
    <p>Only slightly above a quar­ter of those polled, or 27 per cent, would make do­na­tion de­ci­sions based on the board’s di­ver­sity. Whether they do­nate is still driven largely by the char­ity’s mis­sion, rep­u­ta­tion and con­ve­nience of mak­ing a do­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Con­junct Con­sult­ing has de­vel­oped a board di­ver­sity cal­cu­la­tor tool, found at tinyurl.com/cal­cu­latebd, to help char­i­ties as­sess how they are far­ing on board di­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Uni­ver­sity of So­cial Sciences as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of eco­nom­ics Wal­ter Th­e­seira, who spoke at the panel dis­cus­sion at the study’s launch, noted the dif­fi­cul­ties that char­i­ties may face in boost­ing their board di­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>For one thing, board mem­bers are not paid, their re­spon­si­bil­i­ties come with var­i­ous risks, hence the dif­fi­cul­ties in rop­ing them in to vol­un­teer as board mem­bers.</p>
    <p>“The big­ger struc­tural is­sue is: Do we have a big enough pool of can­di­dates from these mi­nor­ity groups to avoid the prob­lem of ex­cess de­mand on a cer­tain group to the ex­tent that they serve on sev­eral boards, plac­ing huge de­mands on their time at the ex­pense of ad­vanc­ing their own ca­reers?”</p>
