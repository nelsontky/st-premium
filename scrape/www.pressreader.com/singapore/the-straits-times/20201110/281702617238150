    <p>BRUS­SELS • The Euro­pean Union has pushed ahead with tar­iffs against sev­eral US im­ports as part of a long-run­ning Boe­ing-Air­bus row, de­spite hope for a trade truce fol­low­ing Mr Joe Bi­den’s elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s de­ci­sion was the lat­est twist in the 16-year trade bat­tle over air­craft sub­si­dies that turned in­creas­ingly sour un­der the pro­tec­tion­ist in­stincts of US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>Some had sug­gested Europe might de­lay the tit-for-tat levies af­ter the vic­tory of Mr Bi­den, who is to re­place Mr Trump in Jan­uary, and is seen as more sym­pa­thetic to Europe and more of a mul­ti­lat­er­al­ist on trade.</p>
    <p>“The US im­posed tar­iffs fol­low­ing the WTO rul­ing in the Air­bus case,” said the EU’s top trade of­fi­cial, Mr Valdis Dom­brovskis, ahead of a vir­tual meet­ing of the bloc’s trade min­is­ters.</p>
    <p>“Now, we have a WTO rul­ing also in our Boe­ing case, al­low­ing us to im­pose our tar­iffs and that’s what we are do­ing,” EU ex­ec­u­tive vice-pres­i­dent Dom­brovskis said, re­fer­ring to the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>In­stead of hit­ting the pause but­ton, Mr Dom­brovskis urged Wash­ing­ton to pur­sue a com­pre­hen­sive deal on avi­a­tion sub­si­dies world­wide to end the row, say­ing: “As it has been stated on num­bers of oc­ca­sions from the EU side, we’re ready to sus­pend or with­draw our tar­iffs any time when the US sus­pends or with­draws their tar­iffs.”</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton im­posed puni­tive tar­iffs of 25 per cent on iconic EU prod­ucts such as wine, cheese and olive oil and put a 15 per cent tar­iff on Air­bus planes in March.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a list of tar­gets seen by AFP, the EU is ex­pected to im­pose tar­iffs on air­craft made in the United States, along with trac­tors, sweet pota­toes, peanuts, frozen or­ange juice, to­bacco, ketchup and Pa­cific salmon.</p>
    <p>They are to take ef­fect today, af­ter be­ing pub­lished in the EU’s of­fi­cial jour­nal later yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Dom­brovskis, Latvia’s for­mer prime min­is­ter, made his com­ments be­fore the EU trade min­is­ters dis­cussed how Euro­peans can face up to chal­lenges from both the US and China.</p>
    <p>Re­ac­tions in Europe “have shown that there are great ex­pec­ta­tions af­ter the elec­tion vic­tory of Joe Bi­den”, said Ger­man Econ­omy Min­is­ter Peter Alt­maier, an ally of Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel.</p>
    <p>“The hope is that the US will re­turn to mul­ti­lat­eral ap­proaches, also in trade,” added the min­is­ter, whose ex­port pow­er­house Ger­many was the most ex­posed to Mr Trump’s pro­tec­tion­ist on­slaught against Europe.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Dr Merkel yes­ter­day con­grat­u­lated Mr Bi­den on win­ning the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, and called for the EU and US to work “side by side”, but also said the EU must do more to pro­vide for its own se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>She also held up Mr Bi­den, who was pres­i­dent Barack Obama’s sec­ond-in-com­mand, as an ex­pe­ri­enced leader who knows Ger­many and Europe well, stress­ing: “We are al­lies in Nato, we share fun­da­men­tal val­ues... and in­ter­ests.” She added: “Amer­ica is and con­tin­ues to be our most im­por­tant ally, but it ex­pects from us – and rightly so – more ef­forts to take care of our se­cu­rity.”</p>
    <p>Ea­ger to move on from Mr Trump’s crit­i­cal view of Ger­many, Dr Merkel said Ber­lin, as part of the EU, and the US must work “side by side” to tackle Covid-19, global warm­ing and ter­ror­ism, and to cham­pion free trade.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump pre­vi­ously threat­ened Ger­man au­tomak­ers with high tar­iffs on cars im­ported into the US and crit­i­cised Ber­lin for not contributi­ng enough to Nato.</p>
