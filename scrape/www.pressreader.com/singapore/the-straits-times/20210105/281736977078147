    <p>More than 4.2 mil­lion peo­ple, or about 78 per cent of res­i­dents here, are now us­ing TraceTo­gether, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong told Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Of these peo­ple, about two mil­lion use only the TraceTo­gether phone app. But there has been strong de­mand for the to­kens, and com­mu­nity cen­tres that had run out of them are set to re­sume dis­tri­bu­tion soon, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-min­istry task force in charge of tack­ling the Covid-19 cri­sis, said the Govern­ment had ini­tially not ex­pected such a strong de­mand for the to­kens, given that peo­ple can down­load the app.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to MPs’ ques­tions about the TraceTo­gether pro­gramme, he also said there were some de­lays in the man­u­fac­tur­ing sched­ule, which caused a de­lay in the dis­tri­bu­tion of to­kens.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong re­it­er­ated that af­ter all res­i­dents who need a to­ken have one, TraceTo­gether will have to be used at all SafeEn­try check­points, ei­ther via the to­ken or the app.</p>
    <p>“We will give fur­ther in­for­ma­tion on this once the de­tails and time­lines are firmed up, and will pro­vide ad­e­quate ad­vance no­tice to all the af­fected es­tab­lish­ments, so they can gear up and pre­pare,” he said. Mr Wong added that the to­kens will be distribute­d to school stu­dents who have not yet col­lected them.</p>
    <p>Dis­tri­bu­tion of the to­kens started last Septem­ber at 38 com­mu­nity cen­tres, but some venues ran out of stock af­ter de­mand spiked, fol­low­ing the an­nounce­ment that TraceTo­gether would be made manda­tory to en­ter places such as res­tau­rants and shop­ping malls.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mount­bat­ten) ex­pressed dis­may that even those who have down­loaded the app are col­lect­ing the to­kens, lament­ing that it is “re­ally quite a waste of re­sources”.</p>
    <p>He called on fel­low MPs to en­cour­age res­i­dents who al­ready have the app to use it in­stead.</p>
    <p>Thank­ing Mr Lim for mak­ing a plug for the app, Mr Wong said the Govern­ment will try to make the app more use­ful, with more fea­tures to en­cour­age its use.</p>
    <p>“But to the ex­tent that Sin­ga­pore­ans want to col­lect the to­kens, I think we do want to make them avail­able, re­duce any anx­i­eties as­so­ci­ated with the roll-out of TraceTo­gether-only SafeEn­try, and that’s why we are do­ing this one-time dis­tri­bu­tion,” he added.</p>
    <p>TraceTo­gether and SafeEn­try will con­tinue to be a key part of con­tact trac­ing op­er­a­tions as the coun­try moves into phase three of its re­open­ing, he said.</p>
    <p>Asked by Mr Ger­ald Giam (Alju­nied GRC) if the cost of de­vel­op­ing the to­kens is jus­ti­fied, Mr Wong said that of the $10 mil­lion spent to date, “the re­sults speak for them­selves – TraceTo­gether has stopped the trans­mis­sion of the virus in many in­stances, and has helped save many lives. So I have no doubt about the cost-ef­fec­tive­ness of this pro­gramme”.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, it took con­tact trac­ers two days to in­ter­view an in­fected per­son be­fore they could es­tab­lish his close con­tacts. Now they can rely on TraceTo­gether data and it takes only hours.</p>
    <p>Mr Den­nis Tan (Hougang) had asked if it would have cost less to is­sue recharge­able to­kens in­stead of the cur­rent ones that go flat af­ter about six months.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said that given the need to roll out the to­kens quickly, the Govern­ment had cho­sen the cur­rent de­sign, which uses off-the-shelf com­po­nents and re­quires less com­plex­ity, time and costs to make. He added that some of the to­kens will have to be re­placed, but some will need to have only their bat­ter­ies re­placed, and a process will be put in place for peo­ple to do so eas­ily.</p>
    <p>All the as­so­ci­ated costs had been con­sid­ered, he said, adding: “Over­all, we still think that this ap­proach, given the cir­cum­stances, given the ur­gency of rolling out the to­kens, was a bet­ter ap­proach.”</p>
