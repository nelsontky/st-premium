    <p>Two of three mosques that were closed for clean­ing yes­ter­day af­ter be­ing vis­ited by Covid-19 pos­i­tive pa­tients will re­open to­day.</p>
    <p>Te­meng­gong Daeng Ibrahim Mosque in Telok Blan­gah and EnNaeem Mosque in Hougang will re­open for noon prayers and there­after.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Ah­mad Mosque in Pasir Pan­jang will re­open for prayers to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>The Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore (Muis) said yes­ter­day that it was in­formed by the Min­istry of Health (MOH) that in­di­vid­u­als who had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 had been to the three mosques re­cently.</p>
    <p>Book­ings for con­gre­ga­tional prayer at the mosques yes­ter­day were voided due to the clo­sures.</p>
    <p>Muis noted that MOH is ac­tively con­duct­ing con­tact trac­ing and all con­gre­gants who have been iden­ti­fied as close con­tacts of the in­di­vid­u­als who tested pos­i­tive will be reached for “nec­es­sary fol­low-up ac­tion”.</p>
    <p>“This is also a timely re­minder of the im­por­tance of us­ing TraceTo­gether when vis­it­ing the mosques, so that any­one who has had pos­si­ble ex­po­sure to an in­fected per­son can be iden­ti­fied and reached quickly,” said Muis.</p>
    <p>Since Nov 13, 10 mosques have been al­low­ing 150 wor­ship­pers at each Fri­day prayer ses­sion in a pi­lot pro­gramme, 50 more than the pre­vi­ous limit. Other mosques, in­clud­ing the three that were closed, may have 100.</p>
    <p>Muis said last month that it aims to even­tu­ally lift the limit for the 10 mosques to 250 peo­ple at each ses­sion by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>This is in line with the Gov­ern­ment’s move for a pi­lot pro­gramme al­low­ing wor­ship ses­sions of up to 250 par­tic­i­pants for re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions that have safely con­ducted ser­vices for 100 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The three mosques were closed</p>
    <p>fol­low­ing an­nounce­ments by MOH on Tues­day that there were five un­linked cases of Covid-19 in the past week.</p>
    <p>The most re­cent, also an­nounced on Tues­day, was a 66-year-old cleaner who works in the tran­sit area of Changi Air­port Ter­mi­nal 3.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, MOH an­nounced that a 35-year-old Nepalese man had tested pos­i­tive in a pre-de­par­ture screen­ing on Nov 28 be­fore a trip to the United States.</p>
    <p>Two other cases were picked up dur­ing com­mu­nity sur­veil­lance</p>
    <p>test­ing in which 876 stall­hold­ers and work­ers in and near Tekka Cen­tre were tested on Nov 26.</p>
    <p>One was a 60-year-old woman who sells mut­ton at the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The other was a 41-year-old work per­mit holder who is em­ployed as a ware­house as­sis­tant.</p>
    <p>The last of the five un­linked cases in the past week was a 32-year-old ser­vice en­gi­neer.</p>
    <p>Prior to that, the last in­fected per­son in the com­mu­nity was an­nounced on Nov 10.</p>
