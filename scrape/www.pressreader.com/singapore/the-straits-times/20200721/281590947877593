    <p>The leader of South-east Asian ter­ror group Je­maah Is­lamiah (JI) was sen­tenced to seven years’ jail yes­ter­day by an In­done­sian court for in­cit­ing oth­ers to com­mit an act of ter­ror­ism. Para Wi­jayanto, 56, was named as the emir of JI in 2009. He and his wife were ar­rested on the out­skirts of Jakarta in July last year.</p>
    <p>Se­cu­rity agen­cies say the orig­i­nal Je­maah Is­lamiah was dec­i­mated in In­done­sia fol­low­ing a se­ries of op­er­a­tions, but counter-ter­ror­ism ex­perts warned that young mil­i­tants are still be­ing re­cruited and the ter­ror net­work may have ex­panded in the coun­try to a 2,000-strong force. “Neo-JI” was coined to de­scribe this new threat.</p>
    <p>The leader of South-east Asian ter­ror group Je­maah Is­lamiah (JI) was sen­tenced to seven years’ jail yes­ter­day by an In­done­sian court for in­cit­ing oth­ers to com­mit an act of ter­ror­ism.</p>
    <p>Para Wi­jayanto, 56, was named as the emir of JI in 2009.</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors said he was in­stru­men­tal in re­cruit­ing, train­ing and rais­ing funds for In­done­sian mil­i­tants who went to Syria between 2012 and 2018 to fight along­side those op­posed to the regime of Pres­i­dent Bashar al-As­sad.</p>
    <p>Wi­jayanto and his wife were ar­rested on the out­skirts of Jakarta in July last year.</p>
    <p>“The de­fen­dant pur­posely in­cited oth­ers to com­mit ter­ror­ism,” pre­sid­ing judge Alex Adam Faisal said in a hear­ing room at East Jakarta’s district court.</p>
    <p>Wi­jayanto was not in court for the ver­dict but fol­lowed pro­ceed­ings through video-con­fer­enc­ing from a lock-up at a Jakarta po­lice sta­tion.</p>
    <p>The judge, who de­scribed him as be­ing ed­u­cated, knowl­edge­able and hav­ing good com­mu­ni­ca­tion skills, stressed that JI was banned by the In­done­sian gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The JI net­work – which is af­fil­i­ated to ter­ror group Al-Qaeda – was be­hind the most deadly ter­ror at­tack in the coun­try with the Bali bomb­ings in 2002, which killed more than 200 peo­ple, many of whom were for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors said Wi­jayanto, also known as Abu Faiz, sent two fel­low mil­i­tants, Pa­tria and Askary, to Syria in 2012 to es­tab­lish con­tact with the Free Syr­ian Army and Jab­hat al-Nusra, a ter­ror or­gan­i­sa­tion fight­ing gov­ern­ment forces in the Syr­ian civil war.</p>
    <p>Both mil­i­tants were tasked with eval­u­at­ing and map­ping out pos­si­ble routes for other In­done­sian mil­i­tants to travel to Syria.</p>
    <p>It is not known how many In­done­sian mil­i­tants were even­tu­ally sent to the war-torn coun­try.</p>
    <p>The ob­jec­tive, said pros­e­cu­tors, was for those mil­i­tants to even­tu­ally re­turn to In­done­sia and use their war ex­pe­ri­ence to es­tab­lish an Is­lamic state at home.</p>
    <p>“The de­fen­dant... had wished to pro­claim an Is­lamic state based on syariah law in a re­gion where the peo­ple ac­cept Is­lam as the na­tional prin­ci­ple... and to ex­pand the ter­ri­tory world­wide... and to free any coun­try un­der the con­trol of in­fi­dels,” the in­dict­ment read.</p>
    <p>“With such a plan, JI would some day want to cre­ate chaos in In­done­sia that would in turn in­duce fear and in­se­cu­rity among the gen­eral pub­lic.”</p>
    <p>Po­lice be­lieve that JI has been re­con­sti­tuted and are call­ing it “NeoJI” as it re­cruits mem­bers for a caliphate in In­done­sia, for­mer po­lice spokesman Dedi Prase­tyo said last year.</p>
    <p>Se­cu­rity agen­cies say the orig­i­nal JI was dec­i­mated in In­done­sia fol­low­ing a se­ries of op­er­a­tions, but counter-ter­ror­ism ex­perts warned that young mil­i­tants are still be­ing re­cruited and the ter­ror net­work may have ex­panded in the coun­try to a 2,000-strong force.</p>
    <p>“Neo-JI” was coined to de­scribe this new threat.</p>
    <p>Un­der Wi­jayanto’s lead­er­ship, JI was ac­tive in court­ing lo­cal cler­ics and set­ting up Is­lamic board­ing schools.</p>
    <p>It was also run­ning busi­nesses to raise funds while pro­vid­ing en­trepreneur­ship train­ing for mem­bers.</p>
