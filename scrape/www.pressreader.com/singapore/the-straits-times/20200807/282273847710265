    <p>TURIN • On the verge of be­ing sold to Manch­ester United last sum­mer, Paulo Dy­bala is once again Ju­ven­tus’ tal­is­man as the newly crowned Ital­ian cham­pi­ons race to get him ready for their Cham­pi­ons League show­down with Lyon to­day.</p>
    <p>This time l ast year, the Ar­gentina for­ward looked to be the coun­ter­weight in Romelu Lukaku’s trans­fer to In­ter Mi­lan, but has since re-es­tab­lished him­self as the ful­crum of Juve’s at­tack along­side Cris­tiano Ron­aldo, scor­ing 16 goals in all com­pe­ti­tions and set­ting up 14 more.</p>
    <p>His form l ed to him be­ing crowned the best player in Serie A on Tues­day ahead of Ron­aldo and Euro­pean Golden Shoe win­ner Ciro Im­mo­bile of Lazio.</p>
    <p>And now Dy­bala is re­port­edly on the verge of a new five-year deal with Juve, a re­mark­able turn­around from what at one point seemed a near-cer­tain de­par­ture.</p>
    <p>The Ital­ian cham­pi­ons are fever­ishly try­ing to help the 26-yearold re­cover from a thigh in­jury picked up en route to win­ning their ninth straight Scud­etto in the hope he can start against Lyon, who hold a 1-0 lead ahead of the sec­ond leg of their last-16 tie.</p>
    <p>De­spite win­ning the league with two matches to spare, Juve’s form at the end of the cam­paign has raised con­cerns. They fin­ished the do­mes­tic cam­paign with just two wins and four de­feats in their fi­nal eight matches, but their op­po­nents to­day are not read­ing too much into those re­sults.</p>
    <p>Lyon coach Rudi Gar­cia, whose side have only played one com­pet­i­tive match since March due to the early ax­ing of the French league, said: “It’s true that a team play­ing ev­ery three days will be tired and have in­juries. But the fact that Ju­ven­tus have won some­thing be­fore al­lows them to re­cover.”</p>
    <p>Gar­cia will be able to count on Dutch for­ward Mem­phis De­pay, who has re­turned to full fitness af­ter suf­fer­ing a knee in­jury in De­cem­ber.</p>
