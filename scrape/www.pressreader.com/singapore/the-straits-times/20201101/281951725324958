    <p>In the 1960s, Sean Con­nery was ranked with the likes of John Wayne, Julie An­drews, Richard Bur­ton, Tony Cur­tis and Paul New­man – stars whose name on the mar­quee could make a movie bank­able. Of that group, he was, un­til yes­ter­day, one of its last sur­vivors.</p>
    <p>The Scot­tish ac­tor had gone from play­ing bit parts in Bri­tish movies in the 1950s to be­com­ing a global brand for play­ing James Bond, be­com­ing the first Agent 007 in Dr No (1962), and would go on to play the su­per-spy six more times be­tween 1962 and 1983.</p>
    <p>Con­nery’s Bond was a new kind of Cold War war­rior. He was cruel and vi­o­lent in the old-fash­ioned sense, but he was also a man of the Swing­ing ’60s, and had no qualms tak­ing ad­van­tage of the sex­ual revolution tak­ing over the West.</p>
    <p>His phys­i­cal pres­ence helped make the Bond movies a hit, while the spy thrillers turned him into a box of­fice draw over the decade.</p>
    <p>The pres­sure of fame got to him, he ad­mit­ted. “The only com­par­i­son would be The Bea­tles, but there were four of them to kick it around,” he told Amer­i­can jour­nal­ist Bar­bara Walters in 1987.</p>
    <p>Over the 1970s and 1980s, he worked steadily, each role marked by his much-mim­icked Ed­in­burgh ac­cent. In his 2008 au­to­bi­og­ra­phy, Be­ing A Scot, he wrote about how an ac­tor friend ad­vised him to get rid of his ac­cent as it made him hard to un­der­stand and hand­i­capped his range as an ac­tor. He was able to tone it down as the role de­manded, but could never get rid of it com­pletely.</p>
    <p>Such was his charisma and sta­tus that he could get away with play­ing a Rus­sian submarine com­man­der in the es­pi­onage thriller The Hunt For Red Oc­to­ber (1990) or an Ir­ish-Amer­i­can po­lice of­fi­cer in the pe­riod crime thriller The Un­touch­ables (1987), and not get too much flak for the ac­cent.</p>
    <p>In­deed, he would win an Acad­emy Award for Best Sup­port­ing Ac­tor for play­ing of­fi­cer Jim Mal­one in The Un­touch­ables. It was his only nom­i­na­tion, and only Os­car win.</p>
    <p>The same role would earn him a Golden Globe for Best Sup­port­ing</p>
    <p>Ac­tor. For play­ing Henry Jones, the fa­ther of the ti­tle char­ac­ter in In­di­ana Jones And The Last Cru­sade (1989), he would get a Golden Globe nom­i­na­tion for Best Sup­port­ing Ac­tor.</p>
    <p>While his Bond movies might not have aged well be­cause of their racist and misog­y­nis­tic ideas, his later work holds up.</p>
    <p>With his sil­ver-streaked beard and rum­bling voice, he be­came the ac­tor to call when­ever an ac­tion movie or thriller needed some­one to play the lead­ing char­ac­ter’s men­tor or fa­ther. In movies like fan­tasy ad­ven­ture High­lander (1986) and es­cape flick The Rock (1996) a new gen­er­a­tion of movie-go­ers be­came fa­mil­iar with him as the ac­tor who gave light­weight movies some much-needed bal­last.</p>
    <p>My gen­er­a­tion grew up with the sil­ver-bearded Con­nery, not the smooth-cheeked one who smacked women and shot Com­mu­nists in the name of West­ern free­dom in the 1960s.</p>
    <p>For me, he will be re­mem­bered as Cap­tain Marko Ramius, the aloof, prin­ci­pled Rus­sian submarine com­man­der in Red Oc­to­ber, and the in­cor­rupt­ible Jim Mal­one in The Un­touch­ables.</p>
    <p>If there was a movie that needed Con­nery’s brand of dig­nity and un­der­stated sense of hu­mour, it was The Rock. The el­der ac­tor in­stantly be­came the cen­tre of grav­ity in ev­ery scene in which he ap­peared, giv­ing the over-the-top pic­ture much-needed weight.</p>
    <p>It was then that I learnt that ac­tion movies are not just about ac­tion. When he stopped work­ing in the early 2010s, ac­tion movies – along with thrillers, epic fan­tasies and ad­ven­ture flicks – lost one of their great­est an­chor­ing forces.</p>
