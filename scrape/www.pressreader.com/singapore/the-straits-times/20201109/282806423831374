    <p>UNITED STATES • The Mor­gan Li­brary & Mu­seum owns part of an orig­i­nal sketch of Beethoven’s Ham­merklavier Piano Sonata. In the mar­gin, Bri­tish pub­lisher Vincent Novello writes that the doc­u­ment was given to him by “Mrs Streiker” – “one of Beethoven’s old­est and most sin­cere friends”.</p>
    <p>Nan­nette Stre­icher’s marginalis­ed place in his­tory is en­cap­su­lated in these scrib­bled lines.</p>
    <p>While she was in­deed one of the clos­est friends of Beethoven, whose 250th birth­day will be cel­e­brated next month, she was also one of the finest piano builders in Europe.</p>
    <p>She owned her own com­pany – em­ploy­ing her hus­band, An­dreas Stre­icher, a pi­anist and teacher, to han­dle sales, book­keep­ing and busi­ness cor­re­spon­dence.</p>
    <p>But many Beethoven schol­ars, per­haps find­ing it in­con­ceiv­able that an 18th-cen­tury woman could build a piano, have turned An­dreas into the man­u­fac­turer and Nan­nette into his shad­owy help­mate.</p>
    <p>Born in Augs­burg, Ger­many, in 1769, Nan­nette was the sixth child of Jo­hann An­dreas Stein, a renowned man­u­fac­turer who de­vel­oped an i nno­va­tive piano ac­tion, im­prov­ing on the mech­a­nism that causes the ham­mers to strike the strings.</p>
    <p>By 10, she had mas­tered many of her fa­ther’s build­ing tech­niques, earn­ing a rep­u­ta­tion as a me­chan­i­cal wun­derkind.</p>
    <p>After her fa­ther’s death in 1792, Nan­nette, then 23 and re­cently mar­ried, trans­ported the pi­anos by raft and set up the busi­ness in Vi­enna. She part­nered her 16-yearold brother, Matthaus, chang­ing the firm’s name from J.A. Stein to Geschwis­ter (sib­lings) Stein.</p>
    <p>It was a time of rapid de­vel­op­ments in piano de­sign. With con­certs mov­ing beyond aris­to­cratic sa­lons i nto l arger halls, man­u­fac­tur­ers were un­der pres­sure to pro­duce heav­ier, more res­o­nant in­stru­ments.</p>
    <p>Beethoven, who had met Nan­nette in Augs­burg years ear­lier, asked to bor­row one of her pi­anos for a 1796 con­cert in Press­burg (now Bratislava). The el­e­gant Stein piano, with its light touch and sil­very tone, was not ideally suited to Beethoven’s wild and force­ful per­for­mance style.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing an ob­vi­ous swipe at the com­poser, An­dreas wrote an es­say de­scrib­ing an un­named pi­anist as a bru­tal mur­derer at the key­board, “bent on re­venge”.</p>
    <p>“Al­ready the first chords will have been played with such vi­o­lence that you won­der whether the player is deaf,” he wrote. The com­ment was sadly pre­scient.</p>
    <p>Beethoven had just be­gun to no­tice a de­cline in his hear­ing, but had told no one.</p>
    <p>Though he would later need a louder in­stru­ment to com­pen­sate for his deaf­ness, he was at this point mainly con­cerned with find­ing a piano that ac­com­mo­dated his dy­namic ex­tremes.</p>
    <p>Nan­nette had al­ready ex­panded her key­boards’ range from five oc­taves to 6½, but she was slow to make other ma­jor al­ter­ations to her fa­ther’s orig­i­nal de­sign.</p>
    <p>It was a stress­ful time. By 1802, she was the mother of two small chil­dren, and a six-year-old son had re­cently died.</p>
    <p>She was also en­gaged in a dis­pute with her brother; the sib­lings even­tu­ally de­cided to dis­solve the com­pany and strike out sep­a­rately.</p>
    <p>By 1809, Nan­nette had con­sid­er­ably re­worked her fa­ther’s de­sign, turning out some of the largest, loud­est and stur­di­est pi­anos in Vi­enna. With a ware­house that pro­duced 50 to 65 grand pi­anos a year, the Stre­icher firm was con­sid­ered by many to be the finest in the city.</p>
    <p>Nan­nette out­lived Beethoven by five years, dy­ing in 1833, at 70.</p>
    <p>The Stre­icher firm con­tin­ued to thrive un­der her son, Jo­hann Bap­tiste, and then her grand­son, Emil, who built pi­anos for Brahms. When Emil re­tired in 1896, the com­pany closed.</p>
    <p>But her in­stru­ments live on. In the mid-1960s, as artist and cal­lig­ra­pher Mar­garet Hood raised two young chil­dren, she started mak­ing harp­si­chords.</p>
    <p>After do­ing re­search in Europe, she be­gan spe­cial­is­ing in re­pro­duc­tions of Stre­icher pi­anos, pro­duc­ing them in her Wis­con­sin work­shop.</p>
    <p>She was build­ing an 1816 Stre­icher 6½-oc­tave grand when she died in 2008.</p>
    <p>Anne Acker, who trained as a con­cert pi­anist be­fore study­ing math­e­mat­ics and com­puter sci­ence, met Hood in Wis­con­sin. They bonded over their love of mu­sic and Hood be­came Acker’s men­tor.</p>
    <p>Acker be­gan build­ing and re­pair­ing harp­si­chords and an­tique pi­anos.</p>
    <p>After her friend’s death, she bought the re­pro­duc­tion Stre­icher from Hood’s hus­band.</p>
    <p>“I ex­plained to him that a piano re­searched and be­gun by a woman, that is a replica of a piano de­signed and built by a woman, needs to be fin­ished by a woman,” Acker said in an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>The piano – the work of three women over two cen­turies – had its de­but at the Bos­ton Early Mu­sic Fes­ti­val in 2019. It was the year of Nan­nette’s 250th birth­day.</p>
