    <p>WASH­ING­TON The United States Se­cret Ser­vice has i ncreased its pro­tec­tive bub­ble around Mr Joe Bi­den as chances in­creased that he will be the next Amer­i­can pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>The Se­cret Ser­vice sent an ex­tra squad of agents to Mr Bi­den’s cam­paign head­quar­ters in Wilmington, Delaware, as ex­pec­ta­tions rose that the Demo­cratic can­di­date would be able to de­clare vic­tory over Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump yes­ter­day, The Wash­ing­ton Post re­ported.</p>
    <p>The Se­cret Ser­vice, an agency un­der the De­part­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity, is in charge of pro­tect­ing the White House and se­nior gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials, vis­it­ing high of­fi­cials and oth­ers.</p>
    <p>It had al­ready de­ployed some agents to pro­tect Mr Bi­den around early July, af­ter he tri­umphed in the Demo­cratic Party’s pres­i­den­tial pri­maries.</p>
    <p>As a for­mer vice-pres­i­dent, Mr Bi­den could have re­quested Se­cret Ser­vice pro­tec­tion be­fore then, but re­port­edly did not.</p>
    <p>If he be­comes pres­i­dent-elect, Se­cret Ser­vice pro­tec­tion is ex­pected to be ramped up to a higher level.</p>
    <p>In a fur­ther move to en­sure Mr Bi­den’s safety, the airspace above him has also been restricted.</p>
    <p>Most low-fly­ing planes are be­ing pro­hib­ited by the Fed­eral Avi­a­tion Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FAA) from fly­ing over parts of Wilmington, where Mr Bi­den lives and has been ad­dress­ing the me­dia and sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>One of the tem­po­rary flight re­stric­tions is­sued by the FAA cited “spe­cial se­cu­rity rea­sons”.</p>
    <p>An FAA no­tice to pi­lots shows the one-mile ra­dius no-fly zone is now ac­tive un­til next Wed­nes­day morn­ing, the CNN re­ported.</p>
    <p>Since the ter­ror at­tacks of Sept 11, 2001, the FAA, in con­junc­tion with the Se­cret Ser­vice and other agen­cies, has moved ag­gres­sively to close airspace i n l oca­tions above events held by pres­i­dents, for­eign dig­ni­taries and other po­ten­tial tar­gets.</p>
    <p>The re­stric­tions ap­ply to air­craft and drone op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has al­ready be­gun to project the im­age of a man pre­par­ing to as­sume the man­tle of of­fice, meet­ing his eco­nomic and health ad­vis­ers on Thurs­day to be briefed on the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Out­side the Westin Ho­tel near Mr Bi­den’s home in Wilmington, signs of cel­e­bra­tion were afoot yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Some­one passed out Bi­den­Har­ris cam­paign signs and at­tached them to a se­cu­rity bar­rier set up around an event where Mr Bi­den was likely to speak.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple stood around i n the carpark, wait­ing for news. A se­cu­rity pres­ence was out in full force.</p>
    <p>The flag-be­decked stage from which Democrats hoped Mr Bi­den would de­clare vic­tory on Tues­day – and then Wed­nes­day, and Thurs­day – re­mained at the ready.</p>
    <p>The height­ened se­cu­rity pro­vided to Mr Bi­den ap­pears to be a re­ac­tion to protests staged across cities by Trump sup­port­ers, some of whom came armed, ac­cus­ing the Democrats of rig­ging the elec­tion in which Mr Trump is trail­ing.</p>
    <p>If he be­comes pres­i­dent-elect, Se­cret Ser­vice pro­tec­tion is ex­pected to be ramped up to a higher level.</p>
    <p>In a fur­ther move to en­sure Mr Bi­den’s safety, the airspace above him has also been restricted.</p>
