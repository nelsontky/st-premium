    <p>Drugs voted last week to re­move cannabis from the most tightly con­trolled cat­e­gory of nar­cotic drugs.</p>
    <p>The re­cent de­ci­sion by the United Na­tions’ drug agency to de­crim­i­nalise cannabis is one driven by money and prof­its rather than sci­ence and ra­tio­nal­ity, said Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“It is a de­ci­sion that con­cerns us,” he said, speak­ing to the me­dia be­fore the launch of a book on for­mer of­fend­ers’ re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion jour­neys.</p>
    <p>“I put this down to the power of money. Com­pa­nies see a huge amount of profit, and a very in­vid­i­ous idea that cannabis is not harm­ful is be­ing pushed.”</p>
    <p>The an­nual Com­mis­sion on Nar­cotic Drugs, the UN Of­fice on Drugs and Crime’s gov­ern­ing body, voted last Wed­nes­day to re­move cannabis from the most tightly con­trolled cat­e­gory of nar­cotic drugs, fol­low­ing the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s rec­om­men­da­tion to make re­search into its med­i­cal use eas­ier.</p>
    <p>It was a close de­ci­sion, said Mr Shan­mugam, with 27 coun­tries vot­ing to re­move cannabis from Sched­ule IV of the 1961 Sin­gle Con­ven­tion on Nar­cotic Drugs – a global text gov­ern­ing drug con­trols – 25 coun­tries against, and one ab­stain­ing.</p>
    <p>But he noted that the ev­i­dence that cannabis is harm­ful “is quite sub­stan­tive”.</p>
    <p>Last year, renowned med­i­cal jour­nal The Lancet high­lighted a greater risk of psy­chotic dis­or­der from the abuse of cannabis, while the United States Sur­geon-Gen­eral pointed out three neg­a­tive ef­fects of cannabis – it af­fects learn­ing in ado­les­cents, causes a de­cline in IQ, and in­creases the risk of psy­chotic dis­or­der.</p>
    <p>In 2015, Sin­ga­pore’s In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health also stud­ied the lit­er­a­ture on the sub­ject and pre­sented its find­ings to the UN.</p>
    <p>“The ev­i­dence was quite clear, and I said at the UN, ‘Look, if there is ev­i­dence that it’s not harm­ful, we will change. But so far, what we have done has worked for us. No one has been able to show me (other­wise),’” said Mr Shan­mugam.</p>
    <p>He said it should be doc­tors and med­i­cal as­so­ci­a­tions say­ing they need the drug for med­i­cal pur­poses, and if so, then “a frame­work can be worked out... with suit­able safe­guards”.</p>
    <p>“It shouldn’t be profit-driven com­pa­nies which de­cide which you buy over the counter, and then say that it is for med­i­cal pur­poses.”</p>
    <p>He noted that profit-driven com­pa­nies are in­vest­ing huge amounts of money in the cannabis sec­tor – for ex­am­ple, beer com­pany Con­stel­la­tion has spent US$4 bil­lion (S$5.3 bil­lion) since 2017.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said: “So the real ques­tion is... pol­icy in this area – should it be done by gov­ern­ments or should it be done by lob­by­ists and com­pa­nies? In Sin­ga­pore, we are im­per­vi­ous to such lob­by­ing. We look at what’s pub­lic in­ter­est with a very clear eye, and we take a view. But you know, in other coun­tries, that’s not the po­si­tion.”</p>
    <p>He said the con­se­quences i n places where cannabis has been le­galised are con­cern­ing.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, in the US state of Colorado, it is es­ti­mated that for every US$1 re­ceived in taxes from the sale of drugs, US$4.50 is spent in deal­ing with the con­se­quences.</p>
    <p>There has been an 8 per cent rise in prop­erty crimes, an in­crease of about 19 per cent in other vi­o­lent crimes, and a 151 per cent surge in deaths aris­ing f rom ac­ci­dents re­lated to cannabis.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam stressed that “we need to hold the line in Sin­ga­pore”, by per­suad­ing the pop­u­la­tion with ra­tio­nal and sci­en­tific ar­gu­ments, and also try­ing to per­suade the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“I think if it was based on ra­tio­nal­ity and sci­ence, I have no doubt we will suc­ceed. But we are also fight­ing the power of money in other coun­tries,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam added that while the fight against drugs can never be won, Sin­ga­pore is “one of the few coun­tries in the world where we have dealt with it suc­cess­fully”, with the coun­try be­ing largely drug-free.</p>
    <p>He noted that the ris­ing num­ber of first-time drug abusers be­ing ar­rested is of con­cern, with the abuse of new psy­choac­tive sub­stances par­tic­u­larly wor­ry­ing.</p>
    <p>He said Sin­ga­pore has moved from deal­ing with drug of­fences as a crime to treat­ing first-time of­fend­ers as re­quir­ing help, with traf­fick­ers and big-time or­gan­is­ers the main tar­gets in crack­downs.</p>
    <p>“We have man­aged to have it un­der con­trol in Sin­ga­pore, but you need to be con­stantly on the vigil. And there is a fight in­ter­na­tion­ally as well,” he said. “We need to put for­ward our po­si­tion, per­suade coun­tries that it is in their pub­lic in­ter­est, as well as our in­ter­est, that we fight this to­gether.”</p>
    <p>It is a de­ci­sion that con­cerns us... I put this down to the power of money. Com­pa­nies see a huge amount of profit, and a very in­vid­i­ous idea that cannabis is not harm­ful is be­ing pushed.</p>
