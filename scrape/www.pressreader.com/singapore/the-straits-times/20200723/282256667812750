    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US Open or­gan­is­ers said on Tues­day that the can­cel­la­tion of next month’s Citi Open “in no way im­pacts” the Grand Slam sched­uled to be played be­hind closed doors at the end of Au­gust.</p>
    <p>The Citi Open, which was sup­posed to start in Wash­ing­ton DC on Aug 13 and serve as a build-up for the US Open, was due to mark the re­sump­tion of the ATP men’s tennis sea­son after the coro­n­avirus hia­tus.</p>
    <p>But it has been called off be­cause of “con­tin­ued un­cer­tain­ties” amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Cincin­nati Open and US Open are still sched­uled to take place back-to-back in New York from Aug 20 and Aug 31 re­spec­tively, de­spite sev­eral top men’s play­ers cast­ing doubts over the hard-court Grand Slam.</p>
    <p>“This de­ci­sion in no way im­pacts the US Open or the West­ern & South­ern Open,” the United States Tennis As­so­ci­a­tion (USTA) said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“The USTA will cre­ate a safe and con­trolled en­vi­ron­ment for play­ers and ev­ery­one else in­volved in both tour­na­ments that mit­i­gates health risks.”</p>
    <p>It added: “We con­stantly base our de­ci­sions re­gard­ing host­ing th­ese tour­na­ments on our three guid­ing prin­ci­ples that i nclude safety and health of all in­volved, whether host­ing th­ese events are in the best in­ter­est in the sport of tennis, and whether this de­ci­sion is fi­nan­cially vi­able.</p>
    <p>“We are con­fi­dent we re­main in line with all three guid­ing prin­ci­ples.”</p>
    <p>The US au­thor­i­ties are strug­gling to han­dle the coro­n­avirus cri­sis as in­fec­tions surge to­wards four mil­lion, with more than 140,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>No spec­ta­tors will be al­lowed at ei­ther tour­na­ment in New York, part of the safety mea­sures in place to try and pre­vent Covid-19 in­fec­tions at a fa­cil­ity which was used as a tem­po­rary coro­n­avirus hospi­tal when the re­gion was the epi­cen­tre of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>World No. 1 No­vak Djokovic, who has re­cov­ered from the Covid-19 dis­ease, ear­lier this month said he was un­de­cided over whether to travel to com­pete in the US Open.</p>
    <p>Last week, world No. 3 Do­minic Thiem said that the tour­na­ment was “on shaky legs”.</p>
    <p>The women’s WTA tour is sched­uled to restart on Aug 3 in Palermo, Italy, mak­ing it the first event on the re­cently an­nounced new cal­en­dar.</p>
    <p>It will be fol­lowed by a tour­na­ment in Prague the same week as a new hard-court event in Ken­tucky fea­tur­ing Ser­ena Wil­liams.</p>
    <p>The first chance for the men to play a reg­u­lar tour­na­ment will be the Cincin­nati Open.</p>
    <p>“It’s dis­ap­point­ing that due to th­ese un­prece­dented times, the Citi Open will not be able to go ahead this year,” said ATP chair­man An­drea Gau­denzi.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately, for the mo­ment, there are still large fac­tors at play which are out­side of our con­trol.”</p>
    <p>Tour­na­ment chair­man Mark Ein said in a state­ment: “There are too many un­re­solved ex­ter­nal is­sues, in­clud­ing var­i­ous in­ter­na­tional travel re­stric­tions as well as trou­bling health and safety trends, that have forced us to make this de­ci­sion now in fair­ness to our play­ers, sup­pli­ers and part­ners, so that they can have cer­tainty around their plan­ning.”</p>
    <p>The ATP said a fur­ther up­date on the re­vised 2020 cal­en­dar will be re­leased in the next fort­night, in­clud­ing the fi­nal phase of the sea­son up to the ATP Fi­nals in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>LIT­TLE TO WORRY</p>
    <p>The USTA will cre­ate a safe and con­trolled en­vi­ron­ment for play­ers and ev­ery­one else in­volved in both tour­na­ments that mit­i­gates health risks. ’’</p>
