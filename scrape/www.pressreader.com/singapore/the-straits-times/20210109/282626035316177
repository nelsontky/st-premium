    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • De­fend­ing cham­pion Justin Thomas was happy with his “solid” game as he racked up eight birdies in an eight-un­der 65 on Thurs­day to share the firstround lead with Har­ris English in the US PGA Tour Tour­na­ment of Cham­pi­ons.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can’s five birdies on the front nine in­cluded three in a row at the sev­enth, eighth and ninth.</p>
    <p>He kept the round go­ing with a spec­tac­u­lar par save at the 13th, where he hit into tall na­tive grass, had to hunt for his ball and hit out to the fair­way but drained a 37-foot putt.</p>
    <p>He fol­lowed with birdies at the 14th and 15th and birdied the last to join Har­ris in the club­house at eight un­der.</p>
    <p>They are two strokes ahead of a group of six on 67 that in­cluded for­mer Masters cham­pi­ons Ser­gio Gar­cia of Spain and Pa­trick Reed.</p>
    <p>“It was a good day,” Thomas said. “It was a good open­ing round.</p>
    <p>“It was solid. I didn’t do any­thing great, didn’t do any­thing bad, just kind of made my way around the course.”</p>
    <p>He said the con­di­tions, with less wind than ex­pected on the par-73 Plan­ta­tion course at Ka­palua on the Hawai­ian is­land of Maui, were “about as good as you could get them”.</p>
    <p>“Not much wind and soft greens, so I was glad to take ad­van­tage,” he added.</p>
    <p>English’s eight-un­der ef­fort in­cluded a hole-out for ea­gle at the ninth hole, along with seven birdies and one bo­gey.</p>
    <p>“It was awe­some,” said the Amer­i­can, who had three birdies on the first five holes.</p>
    <p>“I got off to a re­ally good start, mak­ing prob­a­bly a 20-footer on</p>
    <p>No. 2, and that’s what you’ve got to do out here.</p>
    <p>“I felt like I was hit­ting the ball re­ally well com­ing into it and I feel like my iron game is prob­a­bly one of my strengths.</p>
    <p>“So, just over­all a re­ally good ball-strik­ing round and good putting round.”</p>
    <p>Gar­cia erased two early bo­geys with an ea­gle at the fifth. He added six birdies the rest of the way.</p>
    <p>Reed grabbed his share of sec­ond with an ea­gle at the 18th. He and Gar­cia were joined on 67 by South Korea’s Im Sung-jae, Cana­dian Nick Tay­lor and Amer­i­cans Robert Streb and Ryan Palmer.</p>
    <p>World No. 1 Dustin John­son, tee­ing it up for the first time since cap­tur­ing his sec­ond Ma­jor ti­tle at the pan­demic-de­layed Masters in Novem­ber, had three birdies and a bo­gey in a 71.</p>
