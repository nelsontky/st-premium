    <p>In­dus­try of­fi­cials said China has been dis­cour­ag­ing its spin­ning mills from us­ing Aus­tralian cot­ton, the lat­est prod­uct be­ing tar­geted by Bei­jing as re­la­tions between the two coun­tries con­tinue to sour. Aus­tralia’s cot­ton ex­ports to</p>
    <p>China are cur­rently worth about A$1 bil­lion (S$963 mil­lion) a year.</p>
    <p>SYD­NEY • China has now started tar­get­ing cot­ton im­ports, Aus­tralian pro­duc­ers said yes­ter­day, adding to an ever-ex­pand­ing list of prod­ucts tar­geted by Bei­jing as re­la­tions between the two coun­tries con­tinue to sour.</p>
    <p>Af­ter mea­sures aimed at the coal, wine, beef and bar­ley sec­tors, in­dus­try of­fi­cials said it had be­come clear that “China has re­cently been dis­cour­ag­ing their coun­try’s spin­ning mills from us­ing Aus­tralian cot­ton”.</p>
    <p>China is the big­gest buyer of Aus­tralian cot­ton. The value and vol­ume of Aus­tralia’s cot­ton ex­ports are volatile, but are cur­rently worth around A$1 bil­lion (S$963 mil­lion), a year af­ter ben­e­fit­ing hugely from a hike in Chi­nese tariffs on United States-pro­duced cot­ton.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s Agri­cul­ture Min­is­ter David Lit­tleproud called for the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties to pro­vide clar­ity on the sit­u­a­tion and noted fair trade obli­ga­tions un­der the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>An Aus­tralian gov­ern­ment source, briefed by Aus­tralian of­fi­cials in China, told Reuters: “The millers es­sen­tially get a quota they can im­port, and es­sen­tially they’re be­ing told they might not get their quota next year if they buy our cot­ton.”</p>
    <p>If Chi­nese millers con­tinue to buy from Aus­tralia, they could be hit with a tar­iff of 40 per cent, added the source, who sought anonymity as he was not au­tho­rised to speak on the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Re­la­tions between Bei­jing and Canberra have wors­ened in re­cent years, with China ap­pear­ing in­creas­ingly will­ing to use a range of eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal tools to demon­strate the cost of poor re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Canberra has ac­cused China of med­dling in its do­mes­tic af­fairs, and re­la­tions were fur­ther strained when Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son sought an in­de­pen­dent in­quiry over the ori­gins of the coro­n­avirus that emerged last year in the Chi­nese city of Wuhan.</p>
    <p>The coun­tries have clashed re­peat­edly, with Aus­tralia ob­ject­ing to height­ened po­lit­i­cal re­pres­sion in­side China and with Bei­jing more ag­gres­sively flex­ing its po­lit­i­cal, mil­i­tary and eco­nomic mus­cle in the Asia-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian jour­nal­ists have been hauled in for ques­tion­ing in China and forced to flee the coun­try; an Aus­tralian cit­i­zen has been de­tained on es­pi­onage charges; and Bei­jing has told its peo­ple not to visit Aus­tralia for study or tourism, al­leg­ing anti-Asian racism in the wake of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Many of China’s trade mea­sures against Aus­tralian goods have not been of­fi­cially con­firmed or fully de­tailed, height­en­ing spec­u­la­tion that Bei­jing is wag­ing a shadow trade war.</p>
    <p>“We are an open trade na­tion but I am never go­ing to trade our val­ues in re­sponse to co­er­cion from wher­ever it comes,” Mr Mor­ri­son said ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Cot­ton pro­duc­ers and ex­porters said they were try­ing to get clar­ity on the new rules of the game, but in­di­cated they may look to other mar­kets.</p>
    <p>“De­spite th­ese changes to our in­dus­try’s ex­port con­di­tions, we know Aus­tralian cot­ton will find a home in the in­ter­na­tional mar­ket,” said Mr Adam Kay, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Cot­ton Aus­tralia, and Mr Michael O’Riel­ley, chair of the Aus­tralian Cot­ton Ship­pers As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
