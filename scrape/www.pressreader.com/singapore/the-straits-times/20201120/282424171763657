    <p>It is back to the drawing board for Sin­ga­pore’s top pad­dler Feng Tianwei af­ter the world No. 9 suf­fered her sec­ond first-round de­feat in two weeks, this time at the In­ter­na­tional Table Tennis Fed­er­a­tion (ITTF) Fi­nals in Zhengzhou, China.</p>
    <p>The US$1 mil­lion (S$1.35 mil­lion) season-end­ing tour­na­ment fea­tures the world’s best play­ers, but Feng saw her hunt for her first fi­nals ti­tle de­railed af­ter she was up­staged by world No. 20 Petrissa Solja in the round of 16 yesterday.</p>
    <p>The 26-year-old Ger­man, who won a team sil­ver at the 2016 Rio Olympics, ral­lied from 2-1 down to de­feat her older and more ex­pe­ri­ence op­po­nent, 11-8, 8-11, 9-11, 11-5, 11-7, 11-9.</p>
    <p>This comes af­ter Feng lost 4-2 to Amer­i­can world No. 27 Lily Zhang in her opener at the ITTF Women’s World Cup in Wei­hai last week.</p>
    <p>The 34 year-old, who has three Olympic medals, said: “There are new el­e­ments which we worked on re­cently that did not quite come off in these matches.</p>
    <p>“Prior to this month’s events, I had not played com­pet­i­tively for quite a while, and I could not get into the rhythm of things going straight into these big tour­na­ments.</p>
    <p>“My team and I will def­i­nitely an­a­lyse the games and make ad­just­ments to im­prove for up­com­ing com­pe­ti­tions.”</p>
    <p>Be­fore last week’s tour­na­ment, Feng’s last event was the Qatar Open in March, af­ter which she re</p>
    <p>OP­POR­TU­NITY LOST</p>
    <p>It is a bit of a waste be­cause Tianwei has the qual­ity to beat these op­po­nents, but just could not get into a con­sis­tent rhythm for these two matches.</p>
    <p>HE KEYI, Feng Tianwei’s coach, la­ment­ing her re­cent de­feats.</p>
    <p>turned to Sin­ga­pore as a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure during the early stages of the pandemic.</p>
    <p>The two-month cir­cuit breaker also meant she re­sumed train­ing only in June.</p>
    <p>Her coach He Keyi felt the turn­ing points i n t hese last two matches was her in­abil­ity to close out games from win­ning po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>He said: “It is a bit of a waste be­cause Tianwei has the qual­ity to beat these op­po­nents, but just could not get into a con­sis­tent rhythm for these two matches.</p>
    <p>“For this match, she was lead­ing in the first and sixth games but just could not put them away.</p>
    <p>“Still, we see i mprove­ments from the pre­vi­ous match. Solja is not an easy op­po­nent and beat Tianwei twice in three pre­vi­ous en­coun­ters. She is un­der­stand­ably up­set at los­ing, and we will con­tinue to train hard and tweak our tac­tics. I be­lieve once she gets a win un­der her belt, she will go from strength to strength.”</p>
    <p>Feng’s next stop is Macau for a pro­mo­tional World Table Tennis show­case event which will take place from Wed­nes­day to Nov 29.</p>
    <p>She will then head to Ja­pan to play in the T.League, where she will rep­re­sent Osaka-based Ja­pan Paint Maretz.</p>
    <p>Feng said: “The pur­pose of going to Ja­pan and play­ing in the T.League is to play more matches and get back into the groove, which I be­lieve will be of great help to me as I prepare for next year’s Olympics.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">Feng Tianwei re&#xAD;mains on a quest to re&#xAD;gain her rhythm af&#xAD;ter a lengthy pe&#xAD;riod with&#xAD;out play&#xAD;ing com&#xAD;pet&#xAD;i&#xAD;tive matches. That quest will take her to Macau this month, and then Ja&#xAD;pan&#x2019;s T.League.</p>
