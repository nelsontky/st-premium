    <p>Madam Seetharam Pu­nitha­vathi, 69, gave up her civil ser­vice job to care for her son, who was born a quad­ri­plegic, 39 years ago.</p>
    <p>Mr Vig­ness­waran An­bal­a­gan uses a wheel­chair, and needs help bathing and when he goes to the toi­let.</p>
    <p>In fact, the only ac­tiv­i­ties of daily liv­ing, of which there are six, that he can man­age on his own are trans­fer­ring him­self from bed to wheel­chair and back, and eat­ing.</p>
    <p>She has been wor­ry­ing about what will hap­pen when she and her 69-year-old hus­band, who is re­tired, are no longer around.</p>
    <p>He has two younger sis­ters, but both are mar­ried with fam­i­lies of their own.</p>
    <p>With the launch of CareShield Life in Oc­to­ber this year, Mr An­bal­a­gan will be as­sured of get­ting $600 a month for the rest of his life.</p>
    <p>He can start col­lect­ing the pay­out un­der the na­tional long-term care in­sur­ance once he has made the first pre­mium pay­ment. It cov­ers all res­i­dents born in or af­ter 1980.</p>
    <p>Madam Pu­nitha­vathi said she is very grate­ful for this.</p>
    <p>They have no fi­nan­cial prob­lems now, so she plans to save the money for his use when they are no longer around to care for him.</p>
    <p>She spends about $100 a month on di­a­pers for him.</p>
    <p>“Luck­ily he is small-sized, so he can use chil­dren’s di­a­pers which are ex­pen­sive, but cheaper than adult ones,” she said.</p>
    <p>For the past year and a half, he has been go­ing to a day care cen­tre for peo­ple with mul­ti­ple dis­abil­i­ties in Jurong West from 8.30am to 4.15pm every week­day. It is highly sub­sidised and she pays only $40 a month.</p>
    <p>Spend­ing time at the day care cen­tre gives him a chance to in­ter­act with staff and other peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties. At home, he gets bored, with only the tele­vi­sion and his lap­top for com­pany, his mother said.</p>
    <p>“He can be mis­chievous and he en­joys chat­ting with the peo­ple, es­pe­cially the ladies, at the day care,” she said.</p>
    <p>She added that al­though his legs are too weak to sup­port him, he gets to strengthen his arms at the cen­tre by do­ing ex­er­cises.</p>
    <p>She said: “His speech slurs a bit when he gets ex­cited, but oth­er­wise he’s a nor­mal per­son, ex­cept he can­not man­age on his own.”</p>
    <p>He is not on any med­i­ca­tion, she added.</p>
    <p>A med­i­cal so­cial worker had asked her if she wanted her son to re­ceive the CareShield Life pay­out.</p>
    <p>“If he is en­ti­tled to it, we will never say no,” she said. “It will be very use­ful for him in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“When we are around, we can some­how man­age to look af­ter him. When we are no longer here, he will need the money. Maybe he can get a helper. The reg­u­lar pay­out will give him con­fi­dence.”</p>
