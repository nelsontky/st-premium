    <p>• Paris Saint-Ger­main’s for­tunes in the Cham­pi­ons League have been in­ex­tri­ca­bly linked to those of Ney­mar, even be­fore they bought the Brazil for­ward in 2017.</p>
    <p>If he main­tains his re­cent form in to­mor­row’s fi­nal, it may make the dif­fer­ence against a for­mi­da­ble Bay­ern Mu­nich side.</p>
    <p>At 28, Ney­mar is des­per­ate to get his hands on an­other Cham­pi­ons League win­ner’s medal, five years af­ter he won the com­pe­ti­tion with Barcelona.</p>
    <p>It would be good tim­ing for Net­flix too, with the stream­ing ser­vice work­ing on a doc­u­men­tary se­ries about his sea­son in Paris, ac­cord­ing to re­ports in Brazil.</p>
    <p>For PSG and their Qatari owners, it also would val­i­date their de­ci­sion to pay a world-record €222 mil­lion (S$359 mil­lion) to take him from Barca.</p>
    <p>His first two sea­sons in France were over­shad­owed by in­jury and con­stant re­ports that he was unset­tled.</p>
    <p>Last sum­mer, there were strong ru­mours he would be head­ing back to the Nou Camp, but that move failed to ma­te­ri­alise and he is now cen­tral to all PSG are do­ing.</p>
    <p>He is happy, too, es­pe­cially along­side Kylian Mbappe, the world’s sec­ond-most ex­pen­sive player at €185 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The France for­ward said of Ney­mar: “We are more or less the same age and we have a laugh to­gether off the pitch. We hit it off straight away. We re­spect each other, we have a lot of fun.</p>
    <p>“We are also less fo­cused on our­selves now and more wor­ried about the other guys around us, be­cause we un­der­stand that we need ev­ery­one else to be able to win.</p>
    <p>“We can’t do it with just the two of us.”</p>
    <p>Ney­mar scored i n both l egs against Borus­sia Dort­mund in the last 16 and cried af­ter­wards.</p>
    <p>He was ex­cel­lent against Ata­lanta in the quar­ter-fi­nals and mag­nif­i­cent against RB Leipzig in the semi-fi­nals, even if he did not score in ei­ther game.</p>
    <p>PSG, who are seek­ing an un­prece­dented quadru­ple af­ter sweep­ing all three do­mes­tic tro­phies, be­lieve the Brazil­ian – who has scored 70 times al­to­gether in 84 matches for them – is sav­ing his next goal for the fi­nal.</p>
    <p>“I hope the good lord will help him score on Sun­day and us to win,” said his com­pa­triot Thi­ago Silva.</p>
