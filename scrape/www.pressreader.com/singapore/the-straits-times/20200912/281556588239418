    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s busi­ness-friendly rep­u­ta­tion con­tin­ues to draw in­vest­ments de­spite the dis­mal eco­nomic cli­mate. Among the slate of com­pa­nies up­ping their stakes here is Ger­man lo­gis­tics com­pany DB Schenker, which will be adding over 250 po­si­tions in ar­eas such as ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and data an­a­lyt­ics.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s busi­ness-friendly rep­u­ta­tion con­tin­ues to draw for­eign in­vest­ments – par­tic­u­larly from the tech­nol­ogy sec­tor – the dis­mal global eco­nomic cli­mate not­with­stand­ing.</p>
    <p>Among the firms up­ping their stakes i n Sin­ga­pore is Ger­man lo­gis­tics firm DB Schenker, which in May started op­er­at­ing a high­tech ware­house in the free trade zone of the Air­port Lo­gis­tics Park of Sin­ga­pore in Changi.</p>
    <p>The firm will be adding more than 250 po­si­tions here, in ar­eas such as ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, data an­a­lyt­ics and process en­gi­neer­ing, its vice-pres­i­dent for con­tract lo­gis­tics and sup­ply chain man­age­ment Cather­ine Soo told The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Its $163 mil­lion Red Lion ware­house at the lo­gis­tics park, the com­pany’s largest in­vest­ment glob­ally, spans over 550,000 sq ft – the size of seven foot­ball fields – across five floors.</p>
    <p>The fa­cil­ity, its 13th here, brings DB Schenker’s foot­print in Sin­ga­pore to 2.8 mil­lion sq ft.</p>
    <p>The lo­gis­tics firm is a unit of Ger­man rail op­er­a­tor Deutsche Bahn.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Chi­nese tech startup ByteDance also looks set to shore up its pres­ence here.</p>
    <p>The Beijing-based owner of video-shar­ing app TikTok, which has 400 staff in Sin­ga­pore, is look­ing to spend sev­eral bil­lion dol­lars and add hun­dreds of jobs here over the next three years, sources told wire agen­cies Bloomberg and Reuters yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>TikTok has also re­port­edly moved some en­gi­neers to Sin­ga­pore from China this year.</p>
    <p>In the first half of this year alone, the Re­pub­lic has drawn about $14.3 bil­lion in fixed-as­set in­vest­ments – about 95 per cent of the to­tal in­vest­ment com­mit­ments for the whole of last year. The $15.2 bil­lion drawn last year was a seven-year high.</p>
    <p>Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board ex­ec­u­tive vice-pres­i­dent Kiren Ku­mar said: “De­spite the un­cer­tain en­vi­ron­ment, many com­pa­nies from all over the world and across a range of in­dus­tries con­tinue to grow their op­er­a­tions in Sin­ga­pore to serve Asia and in­ter­na­tional mar­kets.</p>
    <p>“This is be­cause we are busi­ness­friendly, we are trusted to up­hold the rule of law, we are highly con­nected, and we have a skilled and reliable work­force,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral other com­pa­nies have an­nounced in­vest­ments in Sin­ga­pore this year, Mr Kiren noted, cit­ing the likes of PayPal, Rakuten, Ka­jima, John­son Con­trols, Twit­ter and Zoom.</p>
    <p>Paris-based in­sur­ance tech com­pany Descartes Un­der­writ­ing is also plan­ning to open an of­fice in Sin­ga­pore, af­ter rais­ing US$18.5 mil­lion (S$25.3 mil­lion) in a re­cent fund­ing round.</p>
    <p>Along with the new in­vest­ments come op­por­tu­ni­ties for work­ers here to gain new pro­fi­cien­cies.</p>
    <p>DB Schenker’s Ms Soo said the Red Lion ware­house has ex­posed staff to new ways of work­ing.</p>
    <p>The fa­cil­ity har­nesses au­toma­tion, such as with its in-housedesig­ned ro­botic arm which utilises three-di­men­sional vi­sion to pick, la­bel and pack prod­ucts si­mul­ta­ne­ously.</p>
    <p>The ware­house also boasts sus­tain­able fea­tures, such as 1,440 pho­to­voltaic so­lar pan­els which cut en­ergy use by about 35 per cent.</p>
    <p>The l ogis­tics firm, which has been in Sin­ga­pore for 50 years, in­tends to con­tinue col­lab­o­rat­ing with in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing on rel­e­vant sup­ply chain projects, Ms Soo added.</p>
    <p>“We hope these ex­changes, along with our (op­er­a­tional ex­pe­ri­ence), will help de­velop the next gen­er­a­tion of sup­ply chain pro­fes­sion­als in this in­dus­try.”</p>
    <p>BEIJING • ByteDance, the Chi­nese owner of video-shar­ing app TikTok, is plan­ning to make Sin­ga­pore its beach­head for the rest of Asia as part of its global ex­pan­sion, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The Beijing-based com­pany is look­ing to spend sev­eral bil­lion dol­lars and add hun­dreds of jobs over the next three years in the city state, where it has ap­plied for a li­cence to op­er­ate a dig­i­tal bank, said the peo­ple, who asked not to be iden­ti­fied be­cause of con­fi­den­tial­ity.</p>
    <p>The in­vest­ment would come at a cru­cial time as the tech­nol­ogy firm is forced to sell TikTok op­er­a­tions in the United States un­der pres­sure</p>
    <p>from the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>ByteDance, the world’s most richly val­ued start-up, is plough­ing ahead with plans to take its so­cial me­dia ser­vices deeper into Asia af­ter set­backs in In­dia and Bri­tain,</p>
    <p>as well as the US.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­net phe­nom­e­non con­trolled by bil­lion­aire Zhang Yim­ing has long eyed the 650 mil­lion in­creas­ingly smart­phone-savvy pop­u­la­tion in South-east Asia, a re­gion where</p>
    <p>Alibaba Group Hold­ing and Ten­cent Hold­ings are also mak­ing in­roads.</p>
    <p>The plans for Sin­ga­pore in­clude the es­tab­lish­ment of a data cen­tre, the peo­ple said. ByteDance’s op­er­a­tions in the city in­clude TikTok and Lark, an en­ter­prise soft­ware busi­ness.</p>
    <p>ByteDance cur­rently has over 200 job open­ings in Sin­ga­pore, for po­si­tions rang­ing from pay­ments to e-com­merce to data pri­vacy, ac­cord­ing to its job re­fer­ral web­site.</p>
    <p>The com­pany al­ready has 400 em­ploy­ees work­ing on tech­nol­ogy, sales and mar­ket­ing in the city state, one of those fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said.</p>
    <p>A ByteDance rep­re­sen­ta­tive of­fered no com­ment.</p>
    <p>In China, ByteDance also runs news ag­gre­ga­tion app Toutiao and TikTok’s Chi­nese twin Douyin.</p>
    <p>Col­lec­tively, its sta­ble of prod­ucts have more than 1.5 bil­lion monthly ac­tive users.</p>
    <p>ByteDance is said to have gen­er­ated more than US$3 bil­lion (S$4.1 bil­lion) of net profit on more than US$17 bil­lion of rev­enue last year.</p>
    <p>Asia is a growth area for the com­pany, es­pe­cially when it is in­creas­ingly likely to miss the US gov­ern­ment’s dead­line for the sale of its TikTok op­er­a­tions in the US.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said on Thurs­day that he will not ex­tend his Sept 15 dead­line for the deal.</p>
    <p>In In­dia, TikTok is among more than a hun­dred Chi­nese-made con­sumer apps that are banned by the gov­ern­ment on con­cerns over se­cu­rity. SoftBank Group is ex­plor­ing gath­er­ing a group of bid­ders for TikTok’s In­dia as­sets.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment will likely ban TikTok from mov­ing lo­cal user data out of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, ByteDance is lead­ing a con­sor­tium that has ap­plied for a dig­i­tal bank li­cence from the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Other mem­bers of that group in­clude a pri­vate in­vest­ment firm owned by a mem­ber of the Lee fam­ily that founded OCBC Bank.</p>
    <p>The reg­u­la­tor will award as many as five such per­mits to non-banks by De­cem­ber. Ant Group and Ten­cent-backed Sea have also ap­plied.</p>
