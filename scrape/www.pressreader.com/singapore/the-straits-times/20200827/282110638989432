    <p>Three men in the mo­tor trade were charged on Tues­day with of­fer­ing and ac­cept­ing bribes of about $12,000 be­tween 2016 and 2017.</p>
    <p>The first, Eng Keng Hiong, a 35-year-old Sin­ga­porean, was a mo­tor claims con­sul­tant at SK Au­to­mo­bile, a car ser­vic­ing and re­pair busi­ness.</p>
    <p>He was charged with nine counts of giv­ing bribes, amount­ing to about $10,900, to three ser­vice ad­vis­ers of Kah Mo­tor in ex­change for di­vert­ing busi­ness from the com­pany to SK Au­to­mo­bile or di­vulging in­for­ma­tion about Kah Mo­tor’s cus­tomers to him.</p>
    <p>Kah Mo­tor is the sole au­tho­rised dis­trib­u­tor for Honda cars in Sin­ga­pore. It also has a car ser­vic­ing and re­pair busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Eng was also charged with one count of of­fer­ing $1,000 to a fourth ser­vice ad­viser of Kah Mo­tor to di­vert busi­ness from the com­pany to SK Au­to­mo­bile. This bribe was re­jected by the ser­vice ad­viser.</p>
    <p>Two ser­vice ad­vis­ers at Kah Mo­tor who re­ceived bribes from Eng were also charged on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Malaysian Tan Kuan Lim, 42, was charged with three counts of ac­cept­ing bribes, amount­ing to about $1,400, from Eng to di­vert the busi­ness of Kah Mo­tor to SK Au­to­mo­bile or to di­vulge in­for­ma­tion on Kah Mo­tor cus­tomers to Eng.</p>
    <p>The other ad­viser, Yeam Wei Hong, 33, a Malaysian, was charged with two counts of ac­cept­ing bribes, amount­ing to $1,000, from Eng for in­for­ma­tion on Kah Mo­tor cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Eng’s bail was set at $10,000 and he will re­turn to court on Sept 15.</p>
    <p>Bail for Tan and Yeam was set at $5,000 each. Tan will re­turn to court on Sept 25 and Yeam on Sept 22.</p>
    <p>Of the three, Tan was the only one to in­di­cate that he in­tends to plead guilty.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments did not dis­close de­tails about Tan Yong Hun, the third ser­vice ad­viser at Kah Mo­tor who al­legedly re­ceived $8,500 in bribes from Eng. He was not charged in court on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The Cor­rupt Prac­tices In­ves­ti­ga­tion Bureau re­it­er­ated that Sin­ga­pore adopts a zero-tol­er­ance ap­proach to­wards cor­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>Any per­son con­victed of a cor­rup­tion of­fence faces a fine of up to $100,000, a jail term of up to five years, or both.</p>
