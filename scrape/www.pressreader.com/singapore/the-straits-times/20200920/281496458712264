    <p>The be­lief that food of­fer­ings left out dur­ing the Hun­gry Ghost Fes­ti­val be­come taste­less af­ter spir­its have “con­sumed” them is not true, said avid “free­gan” Daniel Tay.</p>
    <p>That is, as long as you get to them rel­a­tively quickly, he added. Of­fer­ings that have been left out in the sun for sev­eral days may nat­u­rally lose their taste af­ter be­ing ex­posed to the el­e­ments.</p>
    <p>The 41-year-old re­tired fi­nan­cial ad­viser speaks from ex­pe­ri­ence. Over three nights, Mr Tay and sev­eral of his friends fanned out across Hous­ing Board blocks in Ang Mo Kio and Bis­han in search of fresh of­fer­ings dur­ing the two-week-long Hun­gry Ghost Fes­ti­val that ended last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>In all, they man­aged to col­lect an im­pres­sive haul of 726 or­anges, along with nu­mer­ous other fruits.</p>
    <p>As a free­gan, a com­bi­na­tion of the words “free” and “ve­gan”, Mr Tay re­jects con­sumerism and seeks to re­duce wastage, es­pe­cially by re­triev­ing and reusing dis­carded items.</p>
    <p>Fruits make up the bulk of what they col­lected, Mr Tay ex­plained, be­cause the skin keeps the fruits fresh and t hey can be eas­ily washed.</p>
    <p>“There are a lot of dif­fer­ent of­fer­ings like drinks, beer, sweets, tau sar piah (a tra­di­tional Chi­nese pas­try), and pack­ets of rice, chicken and duck,” he noted.</p>
    <p>“Most of the time, peo­ple open the pack­ets of food when mak­ing their of­fer­ings, and there are rats go­ing around, so it’s not hy­gienic.</p>
    <p>“The ones you take are the ones that are not open, like fruits, where the skin can be washed or peeled off, or wrapped sweets and even otak-otak,” he said, re­fer­ring to grilled fish paste, a lo­cal favourite.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay first or­gan­ised an “or­ange hunt” to re­trieve food of­fer­ings dur­ing last year’s fes­ti­val and man­aged to scrounge up 130. They were placed be­side foot­paths and near grass patches in HDB es­tates.</p>
    <p>Since then, he has man­aged to con­vince a num­ber of friends and mem­bers from a Face­book group called SG Food Res­cue – com­pris­ing men and women in their 20s to 50s – to join the hunt.</p>
    <p>On his third ses­sion this year, an eight-hour jaunt – that lasted from last Wed­nes­day night into the wee hours of Thurs­day morn­ing, Mr Tay and four friends scooped up 524 or­anges, 178 sweets, 146 duku and lon­gans, 108 ap­ples, 24 ba­nanas, 24 rambu­tans, 12 otak-otak, five pears and two pineap­ples.</p>
    <p>They di­vided the spoils among them­selves and took them home for con­sump­tion or to give away to friends and fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“Of course, we tell them where the fruits came from. If they’re not</p>
    <p>okay with it, never mind. Some within the free­gan com­mu­nity have also of­fered their ‘con­sump­tion services’,” Mr Tay said of peo­ple who of­fer to eat the pick­ings.</p>
    <p>He added that his group is not the only one in Sin­ga­pore go­ing around col­lect­ing of­fer­ings to eat.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay knows of at least 10 to 15 other peo­ple who carry out sim­i­lar ac­tiv­i­ties in other neigh­bour­hoods like Hougang and Yishun.</p>
    <p>Some on­line com­menters have ex­pressed be­wil­der­ment or dis­gust, Mr Tay said, but he saw noth­ing wrong with what he was do­ing.</p>
    <p>He con­sulted a Taoist master who ad­vised him to sim­ply be re­spect­ful when col­lect­ing the of­fer­ings, by wait­ing un­til the can­dles and joss sticks have fin­ished burn­ing – sig­nalling that the prayer has ended – and say­ing a quick word of thanks.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay, a free-thinker, said the Taoist master told him that tra­di­tion­ally, it was not un­com­mon for peo­ple liv­ing in ru­ral ar­eas to con­sume the food af­ter of­fer­ing it to spir­its or to leave it out for wild an­i­mals or poor passers-by to eat.</p>
    <p>“In the city, it’s dif­fer­ent. Leav­ing food out at­tracts pests like ro­dents and cock­roaches. In the morn­ing, it is likely the town coun­cil clean­ers who clear it up and throw it away.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tan Thiam Lye, chair­man of the Taoist Fed­er­a­tion, told The Sun­day Times yes­ter­day that eat­ing of­fer­ings meant for the de­parted is com­monly done when one is pay­ing re­spects to one’s an­ces­tors dur­ing the lu­nar sev­enth month.</p>
    <p>Prior to Covid-19, Taoist tem­ples would place ta­bles within their premises to al­low wor­ship­pers to eat the food of­fer­ings af­ter­wards, said Mr Tan, 70.</p>
    <p>He added that this is not cur­rently in prac­tice due to re­stric­tions on the num­ber of peo­ple al­lowed to gather for wor­ship services.</p>
    <p>But it is a dif­fer­ent mat­ter when it comes to of­fer­ings meant for wild ghosts, or ye gui , in Chi­nese.</p>
    <p>“You won’t be pun­ished, but it’s hard to tell if you will have bad luck from do­ing so,” Mr Tan said.</p>
    <p>There are steps that devo­tees fol­low be­fore con­sum­ing prayer of­fer­ings, ac­cord­ing to Mr Tan:</p>
    <p>• Light the joss sticks</p>
    <p>• Burn in­cense pa­per that has been pre­pared</p>
    <p>• When half the stack has been burned, cast the jiao bei (div­ina­tion blocks) and ask your an­ces­tors if they have “eaten”</p>
    <p>• If you do not re­ceive a pos­i­tive an</p>
    <p>swer, try again</p>
    <p>• Give thanks and bow as a sign of re­spect to an­ces­tors</p>
    <p>• Bring the food home to con­sume</p>
    <p>Most of the time, peo­ple open up the pack­ets of food when mak­ing their of­fer­ings, and there are rats go­ing around, so it’s not hy­gienic. The ones you take are the ones that are not open, like fruits, where the skin can be washed or peeled off, or wrapped sweets and even otak-otak. ’’</p>
    <p>MR DANIEL TAY, on the food of­fer­ings that he and his friends pick up. The food is shared among friends for their per­sonal con­sump­tion.</p>
