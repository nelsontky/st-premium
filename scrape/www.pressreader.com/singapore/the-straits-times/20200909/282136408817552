    <p>Burnt Ends was one of the hottest restau­rants in town — be­fore it was af­fected by the Covid-19 cir­cuit breaker ear­lier this year. Pre-Covid-19, on­line reser­va­tion slots for the one-Miche­lin-starred mod­ern bar­be­cue restau­rant in Chi­na­town were rou­tinely snapped up. Re­views by food crit­ics were mostly glow­ing.</p>
    <p>Then came the lock­down from the Covid-19 out­break. Dine-ins at restau­rants and food and bev­er­age (F&B) out­lets were dis­al­lowed dur­ing the two-month cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Burnt Ends chef and founder David P ynt knew the busi­ness had to pivot or face ruin. Its 60-strong staff ’s jobs were also at stake.</p>
    <p>“The Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion threw a span­ner in ev­ery­thing, and made us look at our busi­ness in a very dif­fer­ent way,” says the 36-year-old, who has been liv­ing in Sin­ga­pore since 2013.</p>
    <p>“We had to look at each part of the busi­ness and see how we could grow or re­struc­ture it for it to make sense fi­nan­cially.”</p>
    <p>To quickly carve out new rev­enue streams, the Burnt Ends group, which also has two eater­ies un­der the Meat­smith brand in Telok Ayer and Lit­tle In­dia, de­vel­oped new F&B con­cepts and ramped up its on­line of­fer­ings.</p>
    <p>It ex­panded its menu sig­nif­i­cantly on the De­liv­eroo food de­liv­ery plat­form, added or­der and de­liv­ery ser­vices to its Burnt Ends and Meat­smith web­sites, cre­ated two vir­tual brands to ap­peal to dif­fer­ent de­mo­graph­ics, and launched a new on­line ser­vice for al­co­hol take­aways and de­liv­er­ies.</p>
    <p>The forced pivot to e-com­merce not only helped the Burnt Ends group tide over the cir­cuit breaker, it also gained new cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the cir­cuit breaker, on­line or­ders made up about just 0.5 per cent of its monthly rev­enue. Now, they con­trib­ute five to eight per cent. “That’s a good chunk of busi­ness and can mean the dif­fer­ence be­tween loss and profit in the restau­rant in­dus­try,” says Mr P ynt.</p>
    <p>Although the com­pany ’s rev­enues fell by about 30 per cent dur­ing the two-month cir­cuit breaker from April 7 to June 1 com­pared to the same pe­riod last year, it has been able to ex­pand its client data­base by about 15 per cent through is­land­wide de­liv­er­ies.</p>
    <p>Cru­cially, the new on­line of­fer­ings helped the group re­tain all its staff — close to 90 per cent of whom are lo­cal — dur­ing the lock­down.</p>
    <p>“That was our num­ber one pri­or­ity, and we didn’t lose any­one ex­cept those who chose to leave,” he says.</p>
    <p>Some staff were re­de­ployed to sup­port Burnt Ends Bak­ery, the restau­rant’s on­line bak­ery arm, which sells sour­dough, dough­nuts, scones and other baked goods.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers, es­pe­cially those in cus­tomer-fac­ing roles, were given new roles in Burnt Ends’ kitchen to help pre­pare dishes for take­aways and de­liv­er­ies.</p>
    <p>Burnt Ends as­sis­tant restau­rant man­ager Damien Gay, 33, was one of those who were re­de­ployed. “It wasn’t too hard com­ing to grips with the jobs that needed to be done, and the kitchen team was al­ways there to teach and lend a hand.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one did their best to help those of us who were new adapt to kitchen life.”</p>
    <p>To strengthen its on­line busi­ness, the group used cus­tomer feed­back on de­liv­er­ies and take­aways dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker to im­prove its food prepa­ra­tion and pack­ag­ing process.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the group’s restau­rants now sep­a­rate some of the dishes’ in­gre­di­ents, such as sal­ads’ sauces from the greens, to pre­vent the dishes from be­com­ing soggy when they reach cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>They also use heat­ing bags to keep food de­liv­er­ies warm, and in­clude easy-to-fol­low recipe cards that teach cus­tomers to put to­gether more com­plex dishes.</p>
    <p>We had to look at each part of the busi­ness and see how we could grow or re­struc­ture it for it to make sense fi­nan­cially.</p>
    <p>Mov­ing ahead, the com­pany plans to con­tinue grow­ing its Burnt Ends Bak­ery and Meat­smith Xpress brands.</p>
    <p>Meat­smith Xpress is an on­line ex­ten­sion of the group’s core busi­ness, meat, and spe­cialises in wood-fired bar­beque dishes and smoked meats, such as char siew pork ribs and lamb meat­balls.</p>
    <p>Its web­site in­cludes items from both the Burnt Ends and Meat­smith menus.</p>
    <p>Th­ese new busi­ness strate­gies have been sup­ported by en­ter­prise devel­op­ment agency En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG), which helped the group to di­ver­sify its busi­ness with the bak­ery and grow its Meat­smith Xpress’ brand on­line.</p>
    <p>Mr Pynt shares that work­ing with ESG prompted the brand to think about new cus­tomer bases they were try­ing to reach and grow, and helped them to re­fine and sharpen their new busi­ness mod­els.</p>
    <p>“We re­alised that the de­mand was there for a bak­ery be­cause our baked goods at our Burnt Ends restau­rant have been very well-re­ceived.”</p>
    <p>“Burnt Ends is our higher-end restau­rant, Meat­smith is in the mid­dle, and Meat­smith Xpress is our ca­sual op­tion for cus­tomers,” he says of the de­ci­sion to cre­ate the brand.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is also de­vel­op­ing a smart­phone app, ex­pected to be ready by next March, to build stronger re­la­tion­ships with cus­tomers. The app will up­date users on spe­cials and deals at the group’s eater­ies, ac­cept on­line or­ders and en­able users to col­lect loy­alty points that can be ex­changed for dis­counts at its eater­ies.</p>
    <p>It can also track cus­tomers’ pref­er­ences and im­prove their menu based on such data.</p>
    <p>Buoyed by the prom­ise of its ini­tia­tives, the group is plan­ning to ex­pand in­ter­na­tion­ally and open restau­rants un­der the Meat­smith brand in Qatar and In­done­sia by early 2021, hav­ing se­cured in­vest­ments from out­side par­ties to do so.</p>
    <p>Th­ese strate­gies and e-com­merce moves have helped the com­pany to emerge stronger and more pre­pared for the fu­ture, says Mr P ynt.</p>
