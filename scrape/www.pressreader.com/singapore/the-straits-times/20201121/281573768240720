    <p>The me­dian age of Malaysians is 29, while that of those elected to Par­lia­ment in the 2018 polls was over 55. Malaysians should pay more at­ten­tion to the yawn­ing age gap be­tween the po­lit­i­cal lead­ers and the youth­ful elec­torate, says Malaysia bureau chief Shan­non Teoh.</p>
    <p>The United States has fi­nally caught up with Malaysia. Amer­i­cans have just elected, court chal­lenges not­with­stand­ing, their old­est head of gov­ern­ment, de­feat­ing a scan­dal-hit bil­lion­aire.</p>
    <p>How­ever, hav­ing marked his 78th birth­day just yes­ter­day, Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den is a rel­a­tive spring chicken com­pared with the 95-year-old Tun Dr Ma­hathir Mo­hamad.</p>
    <p>An­other re­cent elec­tion win­ner, New Zealand’s Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern at 40 years old is mul­ti­ple decades younger than both men.</p>
    <p>Over the past sev­eral weeks, Malaysians dis­tracted them­selves from the seem­ingly never-end­ing po­lit­i­cal im­broglio at home by dissecting the elec­tions in these two far­away lands.</p>
    <p>The US and New Zealand po­lit­i­cal sys­tems and cul­tures do not share much with Malaysia’s, yet both con­tests res­onated here.</p>
    <p>Among the Malaysian chat­ter­ing classes, the level of knowl­edge about the US elec­toral col­lege, path­ways to vic­tory and Amer­i­can ge­og­ra­phy was as­tound­ing, given that many among them would strug­gle to name more than a hand­ful of Malaysia’s 222 par­lia­men­tary con­stituen­cies off the top of their heads.</p>
    <p>When the Ki­wis went to the polls last month, some</p>
    <p>Malaysians lamented that they did not have a Jacinda to call their own. Oth­ers found am­ple rea­sons why Ms Ardern could never lead their coun­try.</p>
    <p>“Malaysia won’t have a Jacinda Ardern in the near fu­ture be­cause many Malaysians be­lieve women aren’t fit to be a leader,” film di­rec­tor Im­ran Sheik, who made po­lit­i­cal thriller Daulat, said in a tweet that was shared 8,000 times.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers pointed to Ms Ardern’s lib­eral lean­ings – she picked an openly gay deputy pre­mier, one of three min­is­ters from the les­bian, gay, bi­sex­ual and trans­gen­der com­mu­nity – some­thing which is un­think­able among strongly con­ser­va­tive Malaysians, es­pe­cially from the ma­jor­ity Malay Mus­lim com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>But few, if any, ques­tioned her age.</p>
    <p>YAWN­ING AGE GAP</p>
    <p>It’s time Malaysians paid more at­ten­tion to the age of politi­cians, not so much how young Ms Ardern is to be run­ning a coun­try but the yawn­ing age gap that lies be­tween their own lead­ers and the elec­torate.</p>
    <p>With Malaysia’s cur­rent Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin, 73, and his im­me­di­ate pre­de­ces­sor, Dr Ma­hathir, be­ing widely re­ferred to as “Abah” (fa­ther) and “Atok” (grandpa) re­spec­tively, there is a case to be made for a gen­er­a­tional change in lead­er­ship to those below the age of 50.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, Malaysia’s me­dian age is 29, while that of those elected to Par­lia­ment in the 2018 polls was over 55.</p>
    <p>The gen­er­a­tion gap be­tween po­lit­i­cal lead­ers and the pub­lic is telling. A sur­vey by top poll­ster Merdeka Cen­tre in 2017 found that seven out of 10 vot­ers below the age of 30 in Penin­su­lar Malaysia did not care about pol­i­tics, while two-thirds be­lieved politi­cians were not just un­trust­wor­thy, but the “main prob­lem in Malaysia”. Four in 10 were not reg­is­tered to vote, mak­ing up two-thirds of the four mil­lion who had failed to reg­is­ter for the 2018 elec­tions.</p>
    <p>Last year, a new Merdeka Cen­ter sur­vey saw 79 per cent of those aged 18 to 35 claim that cur­rent po­lit­i­cal choices were too lim­ited.</p>
    <p>All par­ties will need to look at re­newal and re­vi­tal­i­sa­tion, but this is es­pe­cially so for the op­po­si­tion that is caught in the mid­dle of a decades-old feud be­tween its two lead­ers – Parti Pe­juang Tanah Air’s Dr Ma­hathir and Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat (PKR) pres­i­dent An­war Ibrahim, 73.</p>
    <p>Both men have been at log­ger­heads since 1998 when then Prime Min­is­ter Ma­hathir sacked his deputy, Datuk Seri An­war. De­spite set­ting aside their dif­fer­ences</p>
    <p>(tem­po­rar­ily) to win the</p>
    <p>2018 Gen­eral</p>
    <p>Elec­tion, their quar­rel over when – or if at all – Mr</p>
    <p>An­war was to suc­ceed Dr</p>
    <p>Ma­hathir as pre­mier, as agreed un­der a</p>
    <p>Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) tran­si­tion plan, pre­cip­i­tated the col­lapse of the coali­tion’s rule.</p>
    <p>Just last week, Dr Ma­hathir re­vived an old com­plaint – Mr An­war’s ap­proach to the 1997 Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis – as the rea­son his then Deputy Pre­mier and Fi­nance Min­is­ter is un­fit to steer Malaysia through today’s Covid-19-in­duced re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>It re­sulted in barbs traded be­tween their par­ties, re­in­forc­ing the point that Malaysian pol­i­tics has too of­ten been en­tan­gled in and hi­jacked by the quar­rel be­tween these two men.</p>
    <p>While the most well known, they are not the only ones still re­luc­tant to leave the po­lit­i­cal ring de­spite their ad­vanc­ing years. Umno’s Tan Sri Tengku Raza­leigh Hamzah, the Gua Mu­sang MP, is still cling­ing to hopes of as­cend­ing to the premier­ship at 83. An­other old-timer, Mr Lim Kit Siang, is push­ing 80 but is still the most revered fig­ure in his Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party (DAP) and was its par­lia­men­tary leader un­til its 2018 polls win. His son Lim Guan Eng is cur­rently DAP sec­re­tary-gen­eral and turns 60 on Dec 8, while the younger Mr Lim’s PKR coun­ter­part Sai­fud­din Na­su­tion turns 57 the day be­fore.</p>
    <p>Out­side of the PH op­po­si­tion coali­tion, Warisan pres­i­dent Shafie Ap­dal, 66, was once mooted as a prime min­is­te­rial can­di­date, but his fail­ure to de­fend his chief min­is­ter­ship of Sabah in Septem­ber has dimmed his chances.</p>
    <p>And let’s not for­get that 56-year-old Datuk Seri Azmin Ali, now Se­nior Min­is­ter for the Econ­omy, was PKR deputy pres­i­dent for the past decade un­til his strained re­la­tions with Mr An­war led him to de­fect to Mr Muhyid­din’s Perikatan Na­sional al­liance.</p>
    <p>For var­i­ous rea­sons, such as the need for a Malay can­di­date or the lack of wide­spread sup­port, PH’s sec­ond-lin­ers are not seen as po­ten­tial prime min­is­ters.</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion is left with no choice but to con­tinue bank­ing on ei­ther Dr Ma­hathir or Mr An­war for now.</p>
    <p>BAG­GAGE AND CON­TRO­VERSY</p>
    <p>But aside from their ri­valry, they both come with bag­gage that takes the shine off their prospects head­ing into the next elec­tion, which many ex­pect to be called as soon as next year.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war has on nu­mer­ous oc­ca­sions claimed to have the num­bers to form the gov­ern­ment, in­clud­ing just last month, but ev­ery ef­fort has fiz­zled out, leav­ing his cred­i­bil­ity in ques­tion. His record is also blem­ished by con­tro­ver­sial sodomy and abuse of power charges, de­spite get­ting a royal par­don af­ter PH’s 2018 vic­tory.</p>
    <p>As for Dr Ma­hathir, many non-Malays still view him as a Malay su­prem­a­cist. His con­tro­ver­sial sack­ing of Mr An­war sparked off the Re­for­masi move­ment that shook up Malaysian pol­i­tics with its calls to end crony cap­i­tal­ism and en­demic cor­rup­tion, con­di­tions which many see as the dark side of Dr Ma­hathir’s con­tri­bu­tions to na­tional de­vel­op­ment in his 22 years as pre­mier from 1981.</p>
    <p>But the fer­vour of the Re­for­masi move­ment is now largely re­mem­bered only by peo­ple cur­rently in their late 30s to 50s and above. More than three mil­lion new vot­ers will be added to the rolls in 2023, the year the next gen­eral elec­tion is due. They were</p>
    <p>Party vet­er­ans in their golden years are un­doubt­edly in­flu­en­tial. But aside from a hand­ful, most have no real path­way to the premier­ship. Many, be­ing largely mo­ti­vated by the need to se­cure their le­ga­cies and a com­fort­able re­tire­ment, will find them­selves drawn to short-term re­wards, which works against the na­tional in­ter­est. Younger politi­cians have plenty at stake in the long term, and will need to think about what kind of coun­try they want to lead when they even­tu­ally get there. Of course, it is a chicken-and-egg ques­tion of whether lead­ers shape the pub­lic or vice versa. not even born when Re­for­masi ig­nited.</p>
    <p>The in­flux of young vot­ers – in large part thanks to the low­er­ing of the vot­ing age last year to 18 – is a fac­tor that po­lit­i­cal par­ties have to reckon with as they chase the back­ing of an in­creas­ingly young elec­torate of about 22 mil­lion. In 2018, 40 per cent of el­i­gi­ble vot­ers were below 40.</p>
    <p>LOOK­ING TO YOUNGER LEAD­ERS</p>
    <p>If the op­po­si­tion par­ties do not have good prime min­is­ter can­di­dates in their 50s to 60s, should they look at those in their 40s or younger?</p>
    <p>One needs only to look at New Zealand Pre­mier Ardern and her Cab­i­net mem­bers whose av­er­age age is about 49. When Malaysia gained its in­de­pen­dence in 1957, the av­er­age age of the Merdeka Cab­i­net mem­bers was just 43. Then Prime Min­is­ter Tunku Ab­dul Rah­man was its sec­ond-old­est mem­ber at 54, while his deputy, Tun Ab­dul Razak Hus­sein, who would suc­ceed him in 1970, was 35.</p>
    <p>There is cur­rently a pipe­line of promis­ing young politi­cians. In the PKR, there are sev­eral 40-some­things, in­clud­ing Mr An­war’s daugh­ter Nu­rul Iz­zah who turned 40 on Thurs­day. She and for­mer MP Rafizi Ramli, 43, won vice-pres­i­den­cies at PKR’s last party polls. The party’s Se­lan­gor Chief Min­is­ter Amirudin Shari is only 40.</p>
    <p>Umno has a host of war­lords in their 50s and 60s, but many, like party pres­i­dent Zahid Hamidi and for­mer pre­mier Na­jib Razak, both 67, are tar­nished by al­le­ga­tions of graft, not least the bil­lion-dol­lar 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had saga in the case of the lat­ter.</p>
    <p>For the past dozen years, its great young hope has been for­mer Youth chief Khairy Ja­malud­din, 44, who gar­nered a third of the votes at the 2018 con­test for the party pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>Even Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia can look to Tereng­ganu Chief Min­is­ter Ah­mad Sam­suri Mokhtar, 49.</p>
    <p>Younger still is for­mer Youth and Sports Min­is­ter Syed Sad­diq Ab­dul Rah­man, whose new party Muda (“young” in Malay) is al­ready mak­ing head­way, with more than 30,000 reg­is­ter­ing in­ter­est within a month of its Septem­ber launch.</p>
    <p>Mr Syed Sad­diq, who was 25 when Dr Ma­hathir ap­pointed him to the Cab­i­net in 2018, may not be a con­tender for the premier­ship at the next polls. But he may not have to wait for long to be in the reck­on­ing if Malaysia fol­lows the re­cent trend of elect­ing young lead­ers seen in coun­tries such as Ire­land, Fin­land and France, which have picked heads of gov­ern­ments in their 30s since 2017.</p>
    <p>Party vet­er­ans in their golden years are un­doubt­edly in­flu­en­tial. But aside from a hand­ful, most have no real path­way to the premier­ship. Many, be­ing largely mo­ti­vated by the need to se­cure their le­ga­cies and a com­fort­able re­tire­ment, will find them­selves drawn to short-term re­wards, which works against the na­tional in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>Younger politi­cians have plenty at stake in the long term, and will need to think about what kind of coun­try they want to lead when they even­tu­ally get there. Of course, it is a chicken-and-egg ques­tion of whether lead­ers shape the pub­lic or vice versa.</p>
    <p>But if Malaysia wants to ex­tri­cate it­self from its present po­lit­i­cal quag­mire, it needs to jet­ti­son an­cient po­lit­i­cal bag­gage and the toxic legacy of decades-old grudges. No growth is pos­si­ble if this dead weight is not lifted.</p>
