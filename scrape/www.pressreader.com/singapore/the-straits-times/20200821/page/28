But I am glad to be able to watch them via streaming. We’re glad too! Over a third refuse to return trays, clear used tissues at hawker centres People neglecting to maintain healthy behaviour Common sense will prevail on shared paths if there are penalties Reports on the resurgence of virus infections in other countries that had reopened their economies are cause for worry (Surge in cases in countries that contained coronaviru­s in early months signals move to new phase, says WHO, ST Online,
Aug 18).
As Dr Takeshi Kasai, the World Health Organisati­on’s regional director for the Western Pacific, said people in these countries need to “maintain their healthy behaviour, not just protecting themselves, but their family, communitie­s”.
With that said, I observed recently, while grabbing a bite at the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital foodcourt, a number of diners who did not put their masks back on after finishing their meal, as they are supposed to.
One elderly man was reading his morning newspaper without his mask on. Another elderly man, also with no mask on, went to get a teaspoon for his wife, walking back to the coffee stall where there was a long queue of customers waiting to take advantage of the very generous $1.50 breakfast set.
We all have to maintain our healthy behaviour, especially as members of the public in a hospital foodcourt.
It would not do for our brave front-line doctors and nurses on their break to be infected by unthinking members of the public. We thank Ms Susan Tan Lin Neo for her feedback (Dangers of bad habits at hawker centres not taken seriously, Aug 13).
We agree with her that patrons at hawker centres must clear their own trays and used tissues. As used tissues or wet wipes can be contaminat­ed, they pose a risk to others who touch them directly, or the surfaces they were in contact with.
The National Environmen­t Agency (NEA) urges the public to properly dispose of their used tissues and wet wipes to keep the dining tables clean for the next user, and minimise the risk of disease transmissi­on to cleaners and other diners.
Ms Tan is also right in stating that leaving table-clearing to cleaners is the wrong mindset to have. We still hear the occasional comment that clearing one’s litter or tray would deprive cleaners of their jobs.
This is a misconcept­ion, and an excuse that a minority of diners use for not cleaning up after themselves.
Cleaners will still have other cleaning tasks to perform at the tray return points or centralise­d dishwashin­g stations.
In fact, leaving trays and soiled tissues behind makes their cleaning jobs more difficult. Thankfully, the majority of those who frequent hawker centres understand the important roles played by cleaners as essential workers in safeguardi­ng public health, and do their part to keep Singapore clean.
The NEA has been deploying SG Clean Ambassador­s to hawker centres since June 19 to advise patrons to return their trays and used crockery, and to properly dispose of their used tissues or wet wipes. Disappoint­ingly, only about 60 per cent of diners comply when advised by our ambassador­s.
The average tray return rate at new hawker centres with automated tray return and centralise­d dishwashin­g facilities, as well as a few existing hawker centres with manual tray return racks, is currently above 60 per cent, compared with around 30 per cent for most other hawker centres across the island.
The locations of the centres with good tray return rates are well spread out geographic­ally.
This shows that more can be done to improve tray return rates, and all of us can play a part starting with the hawker centre that we patronise.
We urge everyone to work with the NEA to take greater ownership of our hawker centres, to help maintain the clean and hygienic environmen­t of our community dining rooms. I agree with Mr Ramamurthy Mahesh Kumar’s views on laying down laws to force both pedestrian­s and cyclists to share the paths with mutual respect (Penalties the only way to harmony on shared paths, Aug 17).
While the Land Transport Authority’s recent clarificat­ion is helpful (Path safety a shared responsibi­lity, Aug 18), having penalties will help bring common sense quickly to users of shared paths.
We should not allow a small minority to disturb the harmony of the vast majority.
When I was in the Netherland­s, motorists there told me that they were very afraid to go near cyclists, in case they got into an accident involving them.
The Dutch judges are very strict with motorists, unless the motorists can prove their innocence beyond a shadow of a doubt. Hence, all motorists drive very carefully near cyclists.
Similarly, all cyclists must ride very carefully near pedestrian­s, because in an incident, a heavier penalty is imposed on cyclists than on pedestrian­s.
It must be impressed upon people in Singapore that those driving bigger vehicles must bear greater responsibi­lity on the roads or tracks.
I think if everyone is considerat­e and responsibl­e, there will be great harmony on our roads and paths. Chiang Ming Yu Excerpts from readers’ letters support the economy vis-a-vis increased loans. Our local banks should not be asked to expose themselves to higher than necessary risks. Many pensioners depend on dividends for their day-to-day expenses. Scrip dividend option will not help to meet expenses. Let banks decide their business strategy. SUPPORT FOR CANING PUNISHMENT INCLUDE SENIORS IN TOURISM DRIVE The NEA has been deploying SG Clean Ambassador­s to hawker centres since June 19 to advise patrons to return their trays and used crockery, and to properly dispose of their used tissues or wet wipes. Disappoint­ingly, only about 60 per cent of diners comply when advised by our ambassador­s. The launch of the SingapoRed­iscovers vouchers to boost local tourism and spending is timely.
When it comes to visiting places of interest in Singapore, don’t forget the Pioneer or Merdeka Generation seniors with limited mobility and who require their family members or helpers to assist in their movements.
To encourage these seniors to step out of their houses to visit our places of interest, the authoritie­s could explore allowing an accompanyi­ng adult to enjoy the benefits of the vouchers too. The UK Foreign Office appealed against the corporal punishment of Yuen Ye Ming for repeated drug offences. Others claimed it was a breach of his human rights.
Yuen, a London-born British citizen, was sentenced to 20 years in prison and 24 strokes of the cane for drug-related offences.
Singaporea­ns might want to know that a number of readers’ letters in the UK newspapers, like the Daily Mail, fully support the punishment. In fact, many are calling for similar punishment in the UK, which, unfortunat­ely, the government will never allow.
Having lived in Singapore for nearly 20 years, and currently temporaril­y back in the UK, I can tell you Singapore is the best country in the world to live in. Colin Loh RAISE TCM PRESCRIPTI­ON STANDARD I recently started seeing a traditiona­l Chinese medicine (TCM) doctor for medical conditions such as indigestio­n.
The medication prescribed by the TCM doctor did not contain any descriptio­n of the contents or the medication name.
In order to further raise the standard and credibilit­y of TCM practice, which is now licensed and regulated, I urge the authoritie­s and regulatory bodies to mandate that all TCM medication prescribed must list its contents. Lim Lih Mei BANKS DECIDE STRATEGY It has been noted that our local banks are well positioned to withstand shocks from the Covid-19 pandemic (Valid reasons for MAS’ call to cap dividends, Aug 17).
Thus, I assume that the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s call to cap dividends is for the three local banks to Lim Poh Seng Duncan Edwards POSB machine at Tampines Street 32 ’’ Gan Yew Sean Andrew Low We thank Mr Liew Kam Wah for his feedback (No POSB machine near home, Aug 18).
We are pleased to inform Mr Liew that a POSB ATM at 9 Tampines Street 32 in
Tampines Mart has been operationa­l since 1994 and would like to assure him that we remain mindful of the needs of our senior customers.
In addition, DBS/POSB customers can also withdraw cash at some 850 POSB Cash-Points across Singapore, including SingPost, Sheng
Siong, Giant, 7-Eleven, Guardian Health and Beauty, and Hao Mart outlets.
We understand that it can be challengin­g for some customers to adopt digital services and will continue to look into more ways to improve our touchpoint­s. Director, Hawker Centres Division National Environmen­t Agency Covid-19 or not, buildings must comply with fire safety requiremen­ts We thank Mr Jason Toh Su Jin for his feedback (Are fire emergency plans factored into buildings’ safe entry measures?, Aug 14).
Buildings are still required to comply with fire safety requiremen­ts, including quick and safe evacuation during a fire emergency, even as they implement Covid-19 safe management measures. Buildings which restrict access to entry/exit points must ensure that such points have doors which can be automatica­lly unlocked to facilitate evacuation once the fire alarm system is triggered.
If physical barricades are used to prevent access to the entry/exit points, these must be easily removable, with clear notices to inform members of the public that the barricades can be removed during a fire emergency.
In addition, in a fire emergency, buildings have to immediatel­y broadcast over their public announceme­nt system that all exit doors can be used for evacuation.
The Singapore Civil Defence Force takes a serious view of fire safety and has been conducting frequent enforcemen­t checks in malls.
Most meet the fire safety requiremen­ts. Two were found to have breached fire safety requiremen­ts by padlocking some exit doors.
They were issued a Fire Hazard Abatement notice and the problem was corrected.
Anyone who comes across potential fire safety hazards can report them through SCDF’s fire hazard reporting line on 1800-280-0000, by e-mail to SCDF_Fire_Safety_Feedback@ scdf.gov.sg, or via SCDF’s myResponde­r mobile applicatio­n.
