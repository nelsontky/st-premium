    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ing re­bounded with a vengeance last month to end a three-month slump, thanks to strong growth in semi­con­duc­tor pro­duc­tion and a rally in the volatile bio­med­i­cal seg­ment. The bounce-back beat econ­o­mists’ ex­pec­ta­tions and fol­lowed a re­vised 7.6 per cent de­cline in July’s fac­tory out­put.</p>
    <p>Should SIA re­view its fuel hedg­ing pol­icy? In a word, yes. At the very least, it should re­think its five-year hedge.</p>
    <p>CHRISTO­PHER TAN, STRAITS TIMES SE­NIOR TRANS­PORT COR­RE­SPON­DENT, IN A COM­MEN­TARY</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s man­u­fac­tur­ing re­bounded with a vengeance l ast month to end a three-month slump, thanks to strong growth in semi­con­duc­tor pro­duc­tion and a rally in the volatile bio­med­i­cal seg­ment.</p>
    <p>Fac­tory pro­duc­tion grew a sur­pris­ingly strong 13.7 per cent over the same pe­riod a year ago, data from the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board showed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Out­put rose 15.3 per cent if bio­med­i­cal out­put is ex­cluded.</p>
    <p>The bounce-back in last month’s read­ings beat econ­o­mists’ ex­pec­ta­tions and fol­lowed a re­vised 7.6 per cent de­cline in July’s fac­tory out­put.</p>
    <p>United Over­seas Bank econ­o­mist Barn­abas Gan noted that key rea­sons for the out­put surge l ast month were a rel­a­tively low base from last year, and de­mand for bio­med­i­cal goods, dig­i­tal so­lu­tions and semi­con­duc­tor equip­ment.</p>
    <p>Pro­duc­tion in the key elec­tron­ics clus­ter surged 44.2 per cent over Au­gust last year.</p>
    <p>A 56.9 per cent leap in chip out­put was sup­ported by de­mand from cloud ser­vices, data cen­tres and the 5G mar­ket, which out­weighed de­clines in info-com­mu­ni­ca­tions and con­sumer elec­tron­ics, as well as com­puter pe­riph­er­als and data stor­age seg­ments.</p>
    <p>The elec­tron­ics clus­ter out­put has in­creased 4.1 per cent so far this year com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>May­bank Kim Eng econ­o­mists Chua Hak Bin and Lee Ju Ye said: “Man­u­fac­tur­ing has been re­silient in this pan­demic re­ces­sion, with sup­ply chains and trade flows fac­ing only tem­po­rary dis­rup­tions.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore’s man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor has es­caped re­ces­sion in this down­turn, in con­trast to the past three re­ces­sions.”</p>
    <p>They fore­cast that fac­tory pro­duc­tion will re­main pos­i­tive for the rest of the year, with ro­bust de­mand for semi­con­duc­tors and IT equip­ment con­tin­u­ing to drive growth.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, down­side risks for man­u­fac­tur­ing in­clude an in­ten­si­fy­ing United States-China tech war, which could dis­rupt global sup­ply chains, and a win­ter Covid-19 wave, which may force more coun­tries to re­vert to lock­downs,” Dr Chua and Ms Lee noted.</p>
    <p>The volatile bio­med­i­cal man­u­fac­tur­ing seg­ment re­bounded from July’s 24.3 per cent con­trac­tion to record an uptick of 8.4 per cent last month. This was due to higher ex­port de­mand for med­i­cal in­stru­ments and in­creased out­put in bi­o­log­i­cal prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>It has been Sin­ga­pore’s best-per­form­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing seg­ment this year, with an 18 per cent im­prove­ment over last year.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, trans­port en­gi­neer­ing out­put plunged 36 per cent last month, com­pared with the same pe­riod last year, and is down 22.2 per cent so far this year.</p>
    <p>The im­pact from the pan­demic sent the aero­space seg­ment down 34 per cent, while marine and off­shore en­gi­neer­ing dived 50.7 per cent.</p>
    <p>The trans­port en­gi­neer­ing clus­ter has shrunk 22.2 per cent so far this year.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy Se­lena Ling said growth in both the over­all man­u­fac­tur­ing in­dus­try and the key elec­tron­ics seg­ment bodes well for Sin­ga­pore’s re­cov­ery in the months ahead.</p>
    <p>She noted that man­u­fac­tur­ing’s over­all growth last month was the high­est year-on-year ex­pan­sion since March, while the elec­tron­ics surge was the clus­ter’s largest since Oc­to­ber 2017.</p>
    <p>“Our sense is that the uptick in the global elec­tron­ics de­mand will likely sus­tain in the com­ing months as this im­prove­ment trend is ap­par­ent across other key re­gional man­u­fac­tur­ing hubs, in­clud­ing Tai­wan and South Korea,” she said.</p>
