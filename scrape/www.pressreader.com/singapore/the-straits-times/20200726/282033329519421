    <p>Re­tiree Soh Poh Neo used to find it “frus­trat­ing” when some play­ers from her reg­u­lar bad­minton group, com­pris­ing eight to 10 peo­ple, did not show up for their weekly so­cial games.</p>
    <p>“As long as three or four play­ers don’t show up, we can­not carry on,” Soh told The Sun­day Times, adding that they used to book three courts and play dou­bles.</p>
    <p>“It’s frus­trat­ing be­cause you don’t know whether they will come or not, so you don’t en­joy the game be­cause there’s no guar­an­tee that peo­ple will come.”</p>
    <p>This, cou­pled with the dif­fi­culty of se­cur­ing courts at com­mu­nity cen­tres, prompted the 64-year-old to join Meetup in 2013.</p>
    <p>The plat­form al­lows users to or­gan­ise on­line groups to host re­al­life events that oth­ers can join and par­tic­i­pate in ac­tiv­i­ties re­lated to their shared in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>Be­sides sports, the ac­tiv­i­ties in­clude a wide range of in­ter­ests in­clud­ing mu­sic, tech­nol­ogy and travel.</p>
    <p>Such so­cial groups are in the spot­light af­ter a man, who was listed among six com­mu­nity Covid-19 cases on June 26, joined 28 oth­ers from one of these groups to play bad­minton at Jurong East In­door Sports Hall.</p>
    <p>GROUPS GALORE</p>
    <p>Join­ing Meetup has pro­vided Soh “a lot more op­por­tu­ni­ties to play with so many other peo­ple” and also solved the prob­lem of noshows, as there is usu­ally a wait­list of play­ers keen to be a part of the ac­tion.</p>
    <p>She now plays four to five times a week, and has joined over 1,000 ses­sions via her 19 bad­minton groups on Meetup. She is also in three Face­book groups.</p>
    <p>There are at least five bad­minton in­ter­est groups on Face­book and a search for bad­minton groups in Sin­ga­pore yielded over 100 re­sults on Meetup.</p>
    <p>Though the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has led to lower court avail­abil­ity due to tighter re­stric­tions on court book­ings and safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, Soh is glad to have found another av­enue to play bad­minton.</p>
    <p>“(The ben­e­fit of j oin­ing plat­forms like Meetup is) meet­ing friends and get­ting to en­joy the game,” she said.</p>
    <p>“It’s won­der­ful to play with the young ones and laugh with them. Many of them be­come (my) Face­book friends. At my age, it’s very im­por­tant to keep ac­tive and mix around with the young ones.”</p>
    <p>Soh is among sports en­thu­si­asts here who have turned to re­sources like Meetup, Rovo and Face­book to par­tic­i­pate in sport due to the ease with which they can find games to join or part­ners to spar with.</p>
    <p>The ad­van­tages of us­ing such plat­forms also in­clude en­sur­ing that there is a court or pitch avail­able for games, some­times for a fee.</p>
    <p>MATCH­ING SKILL LEV­ELS</p>
    <p>Ritesh An­gu­ral, co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of Sin­ga­pore-based app Rovo, told The Sun­day Times the idea for such a plat­form came about be­cause he had trou­ble find­ing fel­low ten­nis play­ers of a sim­i­lar stan­dard to spar with.</p>
    <p>As such, the app, whose users hail from Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia, In­done­sia, the Philip­pines and In­dia, al­lows them to rate their skill level so that they will be matched with other play­ers of equal or sim­i­lar stan­dards.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to build some­thing that will get peo­ple to be ac­tive and play more,” said An­gu­ral, 33, who con­sid­ers Face­book groups and pri­vate What­sApp groups to be Rovo’s big­gest com­peti­tors.</p>
    <p>“We had a lot of peo­ple who play ten­nis and also other sports telling us this could also work for yoga, foot­ball and so many dif­fer­ent sports, and so we started ex­pand­ing to in­clude those sports.</p>
    <p>“We want to make par­tic­i­pat­ing in sports easy – whether you want to find a part­ner, book a court, look for a tour­na­ment or coach, you can ba­si­cally do it at your fin­ger­tips.”</p>
    <p>Rovo has launched a new plat­form called Work­out Party for groups to work out to­gether on­line. Its per­cent­age of ac­tive users dropped by as low as 90 per cent at one point as a re­sult of Covid-19, though An­gu­ral noted that num­bers are “slowly go­ing up”.</p>
    <p>CON­VE­NIENCE AT YOUR FIN­GER­TIPS</p>
    <p>Ten­nis player Ni­cholas Pua, who has been us­ing Rovo since Jan­uary, when he re­sumed play­ing ten­nis af­ter a four-year hia­tus, was drawn to “the sim­plic­ity of find­ing games”.</p>
    <p>The low­est join­ing fee he has ob­served so far is $2 for a two-hour ses­sion, while the high­est was $15 for the same du­ra­tion at an in­door fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>The 30-year-old, who works in tech­nol­ogy sales, ex­plained: “When I de­cided to start play­ing ten­nis again, I didn’t have a group of friends who were still play­ing, so the app was use­ful to find peo­ple to play with. The good thing is that you’re able to see the stan­dard of (other) play­ers.</p>
    <p>“If I re­ally wanted to look for a game tonight, I can use the app. Typ­i­cally, if you want to get a group of friends, you’d need a week in ad­vance to book the court and (pin down) ev­ery­one’s sched­ule. With Rovo, if you re­ally want to play, you can find an avail­able court eas­ily if you’re lucky.”</p>
    <p>Spencer See­toh, who is serv­ing his Na­tional Ser­vice, agreed. The 21-year-old has been us­ing the Stranger Soc­cer app, which is also based in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>It al­lows users to join or or­gan­ise foot­ball games, book a pitch or find an op­pos­ing team.</p>
    <p>“It’s very hard to co­or­di­nate a game with your friends as ev­ery­one’s sched­ule is dif­fer­ent,” said See­toh. “The app helps peo­ple like me who want to play soc­cer but can hardly find peo­ple to play with to ‘match-make’ us to a game and venue.”</p>
    <p>GOOD AV­ENUE FOR BE­GIN­NERS</p>
    <p>Such means of play­ing sport are also pop­u­lar with those in­ter­ested in niche sports such as Ul­ti­mate Fris­bee. The Ul­ti­mate Play­ers As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore) (UPAS) or­gan­ises so­cial ses­sions called “pickups”, with de­tails of these ses­sions posted on the as­so­ci­a­tion’s Face­book page.</p>
    <p>These ses­sions, which are now stopped due to the coro­n­avirus, are “purely about play­ing”, said UPAS’ vice-pres­i­dent of af­fil­i­ates Chew Jin Jia, adding that there is no score-keep­ing.</p>
    <p>He said: “Pick-up games are so­cial in na­ture and open to all play­ers, from be­gin­ners to elite play­ers. Par­tic­i­pants take turns to play, with teams chang­ing af­ter ev­ery point. This pro­vides all Ul­ti­mate en­thu­si­asts with a plat­form to play. All they need to do is just show up.</p>
    <p>“The so­cial na­ture of pick-up games also means that be­gin­ners and novices do not feel in­tim­i­dated.</p>
    <p>“Next to learn­ing to play Ul­ti­mate in schools, pick-up games are a start­ing point for many play­ers, my­self in­cluded.”</p>
    <p>NOT ALL FUN AND GAMES</p>
    <p>But some­times, ten­sions ow­ing to per­son­al­ity clashes and dif­fer­ing ex­pec­ta­tions can arise i n such groups.</p>
    <p>See­toh said he has ob­served “heated ar­gu­ments” dur­ing foot­ball games when there is a foul and play­ers lose their cool, while Pua has heard that “some of the (ten­nis) games can get re­ally com­pet­i­tive”.</p>
    <p>For Soh, the “ma­jor­ity of them are friendly, fun and ac­com­mo­dat­ing” but she has had the odd un­pleas­ant en­counter.</p>
    <p>While most have been po­lite and tact­ful i n sug­gest­ing that she should per­haps join a group more suited to her stan­dard of play, “there are a few who are un­friendly, rude and in­con­sid­er­ate”, she said.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria Lim, the or­gan­iser of Meetup group Min­istry of Net­ball SG, re­called en­coun­ter­ing a player who was “quite com­pet­i­tive” and would some­times raise her voice at other play­ers on court.</p>
    <p>“How do I pacify this per­son while not leav­ing the other peo­ple dis­cour­aged?</p>
    <p>“Af­ter all, I’m not a coach who is there to in­struct, but I al­ways (make sure) it’s safe and peo­ple are en­cour­aged to play, and not have that fear of mak­ing a mis­take,” said the 29-year-old, who works at a phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany.</p>
    <p>The group, which was started by Lim’s friend in 2012 be­fore the lat­ter re­turned to her na­tive Aus­tralia, has been man­aged by Lim since 2013.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pa­tion costs $3 a head, and the group’s most re­cent ses­sion took place be­fore the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
