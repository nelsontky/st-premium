    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Ja­pan’s Hideki Mat­suyama opened with an ea­gle and matched Dustin John­son in shoot­ing a one-un­der 69 to share the lead af­ter Saturday’s third round of the BMW Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>John­son, com­ing off a 30-un­der par score and an 11-shot vic­tory a week ago at the North­ern Trust, shared a two-stroke edge with Mat­suyama at one-un­der 209 through 54 holes at Olympia Fields in sub­ur­ban Chicago.</p>
    <p>“This is pretty much a Ma­jor cham­pi­onship venue, and the con­di­tions, the way it’s set up, it’s play­ing just like a ma­jor,” said John­son.</p>
    <p>It was the high­est score to lead in the event since 1974. Not since the 1995 Tour Cham­pi­onship has par or higher won a ti­tle out­side the Ma­jors, but it could be in the cards on this former US Open lay­out.</p>
    <p>“It re­ally doesn’t mat­ter how far away you are, you’ve just got to be in the fair­way,” John­son added.</p>
    <p>“That’s the only way to con­trol the ball and even then it’s still dif­fi­cult to get it close to the hole.”</p>
    <p>The tour­na­ment is the sec­ond of three Tour play-off events, with the top 30 on sea­son points af­ter yes­ter­day’s fi­nal round ad­vanc­ing to next week’s Tour Cham­pi­onship at East Lake in At­lanta.</p>
    <p>Mat­suyama has not won since the 2017 WGC Bridge­stone In­vi­ta­tional, but boosted his chances by blast­ing out of a green­side bunker into the cup from 37 feet at the parfive first hole.</p>
    <p>A four-foot birdie putt at the fourth pushed him to three un­der, but bo­geys at the par-three sixth and eighth and par-four 10th dropped him back.</p>
    <p>Mat­suyama and John­son each birdied the par-five 15th to re­main atop the leader­board.</p>
    <p>“Great start and then just had to hang on,” Mat­suyama said. “Just tried to do what I could to stay in, and I was happy with how it went.”</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s Adam Scott (70), Cana­dian Macken­zie Hughes (69) and Chile’s Joaquin Nie­mann (68) shared third on 211.</p>
    <p>Four-time Ma­jor win­ner Rory McIl­roy (73), who is ex­pect­ing his first child with his wife Erica any time soon, and Spain’s Jon Rahm (66) were on 212, along with twotime Masters cham­pion Bubba Wat­son (70), Amer­i­cans Bren­don Todd (71) and Kevin Kis­ner (70) and Colom­bia’s Se­bas­tian Munoz (67).</p>
    <p>Tiger Woods fired a 72 to share 55th on 220, well back of the third­place ef­fort he needs to reach next week’s sea­son fi­nale.</p>
    <p>The 15-time Ma­jor cham­pion found wa­ter off the 17th tee on his way to a triple-bo­gey seven and a third over-par round to start for the first time since 2010.</p>
