    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin will an­nounce new mea­sures this week to curb a surge in coron­avirus cases, a se­nior min­is­ter said, as the coun­try recorded 2,451 new in­fec­tions yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Muhyid­din will an­nounce the new mea­sures to­mor­row, Se­nior Min­is­ter for Se­cu­rity Is­mail Sabri Yaakob told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“We are refin­ing and look­ing at the new mea­sures in de­tail to en­sure that they work for ev­ery­one,” he said dur­ing a tele­vised news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The South-east Asian na­tion has seen a spike in in­fec­tions since Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry yes­ter­day re­ported five new Covid-19 fa­tal­i­ties, bring­ing the coun­try’s death toll to 542.</p>
    <p>To date, Malaysia has recorded 133,559 Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry has warned that Covid-19 cases could hit 8,000 a day by the mid­dle of March if the coun­try’s in­fec­tiv­ity rate rises from the cur­rent level.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the govern­ment has said it was con­sid­er­ing im­pos­ing tar­geted lock­downs in some ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Ad­ham Baba said yes­ter­day that in­ter-state and in­ter-dis­trict travel could also be tight­ened to bring down the num­ber of Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>“Spo­radic cases which are in­fec­tions within the com­mu­nity and pos­i­tive cases among for­eign work­ers con­trib­ute greatly to the spike.</p>
    <p>“Spo­radic cases oc­cur from in­ter-state travel or at­tend­ing a gath­er­ing or social event,” he said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, busi­nesses warned that wider re­stric­tions could fur</p>
    <p>ther bat­ter the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Science Min­is­ter Khairy Ja­malud­din said that the coun­try’s phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal reg­u­la­tor has is­sued con­di­tional ap­proval for the vac­cine man­u­fac­tured by United States and Ger­man drug­mak­ers Pfizer and BioN</p>
    <p>Tech to be used in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>“We are still wait­ing for a few ad­di­tional info from Pfizer but this means it can be used in Malaysia,” Mr Khairy posted on his Twit­ter ac­count.</p>
    <p>Malaysia, which has pur­chased 12.8 mil­lion doses of the Pfizer</p>
    <p>BioN­Tech shot, is ex­pected to re­ceive its first ship­ment of the vac­cine next month.</p>
    <p>Mr Khairy also said Malaysia set a tar­get to achieve herd im­mu­nity against the virus 18 months af­ter the ar­rival of the vac­cine.</p>
