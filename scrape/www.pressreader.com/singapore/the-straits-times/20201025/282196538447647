    <p>LON­DON • Ever­ton man­ager Carlo Ancelotti said goal­keeper Jor­dan Pick­ford is un­af­fected by the in­tense crit­i­cism he has faced fol­low­ing a tackle on Liver­pool de­fender Vir­gil van Dijk and that he will start to­day’s English Premier League clash at Southamp­ton.</p>
    <p>Cham­pi­ons Liver­pool con­firmed Dutch­man van Dijk will un­dergo surgery on dam­aged knee lig­a­ments, af­ter the chal­lenge in last week­end’s Mersey­side derby which ended in a 2-2 draw.</p>
    <p>Pick­ford has since been blasted by pun­dits and Mersey­side Po­lice are in­ves­ti­gat­ing threats to him on­line, but Ancelotti said the Eng­land in­ter­na­tional had not let the in­ci­dent ham­per his prepa­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>“He’s go­ing to play. I don’t take</p>
    <p>into con­sid­er­a­tion to take him out,” the Ital­ian said on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“I saw him in train­ing this week and he was fo­cused, he put in a good per­for­mance and was con­cen­trated. This is what I want to see from a player.</p>
    <p>“If he has a prob­lem, I want him to come to me to talk but he didn’t come to me, so I think he’s ab­so­lutely OK.”</p>
    <p>Pick­ford made a num­ber of er­rors last sea­son, prompt­ing Ancelotti to sign Swe­den in­ter­na­tional Robin Olsen on loan from Roma on trans­fer dead­line day. But the 61-yearold was mea­sured in his as­sess­ment of Pick­ford’s form early in the cur­rent cam­paign.</p>
    <p>“Some­times he did well, some­times he could do bet­ter. That’s it,” Ancelotti added. “I think when we man­age a per­for­mance, I’m used to look­ing at the right things, not only the wrong. I’m used to be­ing cold and try to see what he did good and what he did wrong.”</p>
    <p>The Tof­fees boss is also hope­ful play­maker James Ro­driguez will be fit in time for to­day, a day af­ter say­ing he ex­pected the Colom­bia in­ter­na­tional to miss the match.</p>
    <p>Ro­driguez suf­fered an in­jury dur­ing a chal­lenge from van Dijk early in the derby, although he stayed on for the full 90 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Ancelotti had ear­lier sug­gested Ro­driguez would be un­able to face the Saints, but on Fri­day con­firmed he had re­sumed par­tial train­ing. “He is not def­i­nitely out,” he said. “For­tu­nately his re­cov­ery was good and he trained to­day. We are con­fi­dent he can maybe play.”</p>
    <p>Ancelotti said cen­tre-back Ben God­frey, who made his Ever­ton de­but against Liver­pool, will be de­ployed at right-back against the Saints, with Jon­joe Kenny yet to re­cover from an an­kle in­jury.</p>
    <p>League lead­ers Ever­ton are un­beaten this sea­son, hav­ing recorded four wins and a draw.</p>
    <p>Southamp­ton started the sea­son with two de­feats but have since turned things around, with last week­end’s 3-3 draw against Chelsea un­der­lin­ing their re­silience af­ter they came from be­hind twice to earn a point.</p>
    <p>“When you look at how they (Ever­ton) play, it’s no co­in­ci­dence they’re un­beaten. They’ve done a fan­tas­tic job,” Saints man­ager Ralph Hasenhuttl said. “But we played last week against a team that had a lot of qual­ity on the pitch and showed we’re not scared.</p>
    <p>“The Premier League is a long run and not a 100m sprint. We’ve be­come more com­pet­i­tive in the last three games and this is the way we want to go.”</p>
    <p>Hasenhuttl con­firmed that Stu­art Arm­strong was back af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19 on in­ter­na­tional duty with Scot­land. His re­turn was welcome news, with Moussa Djenepo in­jured and loa­nee Theo Wal­cott in­el­i­gi­ble to face his par­ent club.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Ever&#xAD;ton man&#xAD;ager Carlo Ancelotti and James Ro&#xAD;driguez were a happy pair af&#xAD;ter last month&#x2019;s 5-2 thrash&#xAD;ing of West Brom.
