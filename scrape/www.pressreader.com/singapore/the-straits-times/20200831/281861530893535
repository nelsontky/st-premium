    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Mr Joe Bi­den, striv­ing to win over un­de­cided vot­ers who could swing t he elec­tion against United States Pres­i­dent Donald Trump, is spar­ing no ef­fort to broad­cast one of his most po­tent weapons – endorsemen­ts from many of his former Repub­li­can op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>From hand­ing Repub­li­can stal­warts prime-time speeches at the Demo­cratic Na­tional Con­ven­tion to welcoming endorsemen­ts from hun­dreds of former staff of former pres­i­dent Ge­orge W. Bush, the late se­na­tor John McCain and Se­na­tor Mitt Rom­ney, the pres­i­den­tial chal­lenger is wav­ing his bi­par­ti­san cre­den­tials high.</p>
    <p>But will it work?</p>
    <p>Ms Kari Walker, a 50-year-old Wis­con­sin res­i­dent who has backed Repub­li­can can­di­dates for two decades, plans to vote for Mr Bi­den on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>Ms Walker, who two weeks ago said she could not bring her­self to vote for Mr Trump – “a worse Pres­i­dent than I could have imag­ined” – felt reaf­firmed by the stance of the former Repub­li­can staff.</p>
    <p>“I found the sup­port of GOP stal­warts to be per­sua­sive,” said Ms Walker, re­fer­ring to the Grand Old Party, a tra­di­tional nick­name for Repub­li­cans.</p>
    <p>She and her hus­band own a tav­ern in the small town of Reeds­burg, in a county that backed Mr Trump in 2016 af­ter twice vot­ing for Demo­crat Barack Obama.</p>
    <p>“I would be vot­ing for Bi­den re­gard­less, but I ap­pre­ci­ate GOP in­flu­encers cross­ing over,” she said.</p>
    <p>While Mr Obama’s former No. 2 con­tin­ues to l ead Mr Trump in polling na­tion­wide, the Pres­i­dent has nar­rowed the gap in cer­tain key states, those that reg­u­larly “swing” back and forth be­tween Repub­li­cans and Democrats – and which can de­cide a close elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The bil­lion­aire Repub­li­can has been court­ing them openly, warn­ing against the “an­ar­chy” he says a Bi­den pres­i­dency would bring, which he says could lead to the “de­struc­tion” of the na­tion’s leafy – and mostly white – sub­urbs.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can con­ven­tion heard from some former Democrats, their pres­ence de­signed to un­der­score Mr Trump’s out­reach to those cru­cial bat­tle­ground states.</p>
    <p>But Mr Trump ap­pears to be ben­e­fit­ing from less party-switch­ing than Mr Bi­den, who has worked to per­suade vot­ers dis­ap­pointed, even dis­gusted, by Mr Trump’s style and stew­ard­ship, no­tably of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic that has claimed more than 180,000 Amer­i­can lives.</p>
    <p>“This is not an easy de­ci­sion for Repub­li­cans to make,” wrote the former staff for Mr McCain, the late Repub­li­can se­na­tor and 2008 pres­i­den­tial can­di­date who had a mu­tu­ally dis­dain­ful re­la­tion­ship with Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>“Given the i ncum­bent Pres­i­dent’s lack of com­pe­tent lead­er­ship, his ef­forts to ag­gra­vate rather than bridge di­vi­sions among Amer­i­cans, and his fail­ure to up­hold Amer­i­can val­ues, we be­lieve the elec­tion of former vice-pres­i­dent Bi­den is clearly in the na­tional in­ter­est,” they wrote in an open let­ter.</p>
    <p>The former Bush staff sounded a sim­i­lar tone.</p>
    <p>“The on­slaught of in­sults and vul­gar­ity we have wit­nessed in re­cent years must stop,” they said. “We have lost our moral com­pass.”</p>
    <p>Sev­eral groups of anti-Trump Repub­li­cans, in­clud­ing the Lin­coln Project, have pre­vi­ously an­nounced their sup­port for Mr Bi­den. But since the Demo­cratic con­ven­tion opened on Aug 17, the per­sua­sion cam­paign has taken on new in­ten­sity.</p>
    <p>Mr John Ka­sich, a former Repub­li­can gover­nor of the swing state of Ohio, was given a prime speak­ing spot on that first night.</p>
    <p>On the fol­low­ing night, Mr Bush’s sec­re­tary of state Colin Pow­ell, a con­tro­ver­sial ad­vo­cate of the war with Iraq, had the Demo­cratic lime­light.</p>
    <p>And last Mon­day, the open­ing day of the Repub­li­can con­ven­tion, the Bi­den team an­nounced the sup­port of some 20 former Repub­li­can mem­bers of Con­gress.</p>
    <p>“These lapsed Repub­li­cans are em­blem­atic of the many former Repub­li­can vot­ers con­cen­trated in af­flu­ent, growing and highly ed­u­cated sub­ur­ban ar­eas who have been leav­ing the GOP in the Trump era,” said po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst Kyle Kondik.</p>
    <p>But he added: “That said, I don’t know if these endorsemen­ts ac­tu­ally move new vot­ers out of Trump’s camp.”</p>
