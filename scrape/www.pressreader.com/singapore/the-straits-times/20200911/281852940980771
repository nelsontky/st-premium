    <p>• Euro­pean com­pa­nies in China are in­creas­ingly afraid of “ar­bi­trary pun­ish­ment” amid a more politi­cised busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment, a Euro­pean busi­ness in­dus­try group said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The an­nual re­port of the Euro­pean Cham­ber of Com­merce in China also high­lighted con­cerns about travel re­stric­tions im­posed on for­eign work­ers be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and the ex­clu­sion of for­eign busi­nesses from key sec­tors of the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“Com­pa­nies are left nav­i­gat­ing a po­lit­i­cal mine­field dur­ing a health cri­sis of truly over­whelm­ing pro­por­tions,” cham­ber pres­i­dent Jo­erg Wut­tke said in com­ments at­tached to the re­port, which draws on con­tri­bu­tions from work­ing groups, sur­veys and com­ments from its more than 1,700 mem­bers.</p>
    <p>The re­port warned that the risk of de­te­ri­o­rat­ing re­la­tions be­tween China and Europe – over is­sues like Bei­jing’s treat­ment of the Mus­lim Uighur mi­nor­ity and new na­tional se­cu­rity leg­is­la­tion for Hong Kong – could se­ri­ously im­pact Euro­pean com­pa­nies do­ing busi­ness in China.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean com­pa­nies now “have even more rea­son to be­lieve that they could be­come vic­tims of ar­bi­trary pun­ish­ment” due to their home coun­try govern­ments’ ac­tions against China, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>The re­port cited China’s im­po­si­tion in May of a more than 80 per cent tar­iff on Aus­tralian bar­ley im­ports, ef­fec­tively stop­ping a bil­lion­dol­lar trade i n a move widely viewed as linked to es­ca­lat­ing po­lit­i­cal ten­sions be­tween Can­berra and Bei­jing. Bi­lat­eral re­la­tions wors­ened when Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son called for an in­de­pen­dent in­quiry into the ori­gins of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Travel re­stric­tions im­posed amid the pan­demic have also left many Euro­pean com­pany em­ploy­ees stranded out­side of China, and dis­crim­i­na­tion against for­eign­ers was ig­nored by Chi­nese of­fi­cials, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>“Cham­ber mem­bers can­not help won­der­ing if these ac­tions and in­ac­tions are in­dica­tive of a broader mind­set that while for­eign cap­i­tal and tech­nol­ogy are de­sired i n China, for­eign­ers them­selves are not,” it said.</p>
    <p>The re­port also cited a con­tin­ued lack of sig­nif­i­cant open­ing of China’s mar­ket, with bu­reau­cratic ob­sta­cles to full en­try in sec­tors like bank­ing and in­sur­ance, cut­ting off for­eign com­pa­nies from gain­ing mar­ket share.</p>
    <p>“Wor­ry­ingly, there now seems to be a grow­ing list of sec­tors that ei­ther re­strict for­eign in­vest­ment, or in which sup­port is pro­vided to China’s na­tional cham­pi­ons to the ex­tent that it squeezes out any po­ten­tial Euro­pean com­pe­ti­tion,” it said.</p>
    <p>Re­new­ables, tele­coms and other high-tech in­dus­tries with strong growth po­ten­tial are tight­en­ing up to for­eign in­vestors, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>China has sent both its for­eign min­is­ter and top diplo­mat to Europe in re­cent weeks, in ef­forts to bol­ster ties amid in­creas­ing ten­sions with the United States.</p>
