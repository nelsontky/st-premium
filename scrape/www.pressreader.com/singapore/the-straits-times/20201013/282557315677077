    <p>‘ONE-ARMED SWORDS­MAN’ STILL ALIVE: Hong Kong singer Linda Wong (left) has clar­i­fied that her fa­ther, ac­tor Jimmy Wang Yu (right), is still alive, af­ter news of his sup­posed death went vi­ral on Chi­nese so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>The boo-boo be­gan af­ter vet­eran ac­tress Helen Ma wrote on Weibo last Satur­day that Wang had died and paid trib­ute to the 77-year-old ac­tor.</p>
    <p>The me­dia sought con­fir­ma­tion from Wong, who said her fa­ther is alive. Wong, 52, set the record straight on Weibo: “My fa­ther is fine. Thanks all for the con­cern.”</p>
    <p>Ma, who deleted her post, ex­plained that she was mis­led by some­one from a mes­sage group.</p>
    <p>Wang has not been seen in pub­lic in re­cent years af­ter suf­fer­ing a sec­ond stroke in 2016. He is in a sta­ble con­di­tion and be­ing treated in a hospi­tal, said his younger daugh­ter Carol Wong.</p>
    <p>The vet­eran ac­tor, best known for play­ing the one-armed swords­man in the 1967 movie of the same name, did not at­tend the Golden Horse Awards in Taipei last year to ac­cept the Life­time Achieve­ment Award. His daugh­ters Linda and Carol re­ceived it on his be­half.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor has won Golden Horse act­ing nom­i­na­tions for his roles in Brotherly Love (1978), Wu Xia (2011) and Soul (2013) and also took home a Best Ac­tor prize for Soul at the Taipei Film Awards.</p>
    <p>He has a third daugh­ter from his mar­riage to late ac­tress Jeanette Lin Tsui, which ended in di­vorce in 1975. He mar­ried for­mer flight at­ten­dant Wang Kai-chen in 1978 be­fore they di­vorced af­ter he caught her and her lover with their pants down in 1999.</p>
