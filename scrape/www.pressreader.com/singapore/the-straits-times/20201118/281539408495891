    <p>With lines be­tween the work­place and home get­ting blurred amid the pan­demic, em­ploy­ers have been ad­vised to ad­dress the men­tal health needs of their work­ers who are un­der more stress and fac­ing a higher risk of burnout. An ad­vi­sory called on firms to recog­nise the need for their staff to have ad­e­quate rest out­side work hours.</p>
    <p>With lines be­tween the work­place and home get­ting blurred dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, em­ploy­ers have been ad­vised to ad­dress the men­tal health needs of their work­ers who are un­der more stress and fac­ing a higher risk of burnout.</p>
    <p>An ad­vi­sory is­sued yes­ter­day called on com­pa­nies to recog­nise the need for their staff to have ad­e­quate rest out­side work hours.</p>
    <p>This can be done by es­tab­lish­ing a work-life har­mony pol­icy to of­fer clar­ity on af­ter-hours work com­mu­ni­ca­tion, said the ad­vi­sory, which was jointly re­leased by the tri­par­tite part­ners: the Min­istry of Man­power, Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The rec­om­men­da­tions come a month af­ter Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong an­nounced that an in­ter-agency task force has been con­vened to tackle the men­tal health needs of Sin­ga­pore­ans. He said the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has brought about more stresses, pres­sures and dis­rup­tions.</p>
    <p>The out­break has led many work­places to adopt work-from-home ar­range­ments as the norm, lead­ing to em­ploy­ees feel­ing more stressed and putting them at a higher risk of burnout, the tri­par­tite part­ners said.</p>
    <p>They en­cour­aged em­ploy­ers to or­gan­ise talks and work­shops on the is­sue, and train man­agers to spot signs of dis­tress, and of­fer help to their col­leagues.</p>
    <p>It was im­por­tant to set bound­aries, they noted. For ex­am­ple, firms should set out a clear po­si­tion that em­ploy­ees were not ex­pected to re­spond to work-re­lated mes­sages sent af­ter work hours – un­less they were marked ur­gent or crit­i­cal.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies were ad­vised to ex­tend em­ploy­ees’ flexible ben­e­fits to cover men­tal health-re­lated con­sul­ta­tions and treatments, or of­fer work­ers ac­cess to coun­selling ser­vices such as em­ploy­ee­as­sis­tance pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>But work­ers and self-em­ployed per­sons can also reach out for help if they feel over­whelmed.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo, who in­tro­duced the ad­vi­sory at the start of the Sin­ga­pore Work­place Safety and Health Con­fer­ence 2020, said the pan­demic will be a long-drawn bat­tle and urged em­ploy­ers and work­ers to adopt the rec­om­men­da­tions.</p>
    <p>“While the fu­ture re­mains un­cer­tain as the world con­tin­ues to bat­tle Covid-19, let us not lose sight of our goals,” she added. “It is timely for the Gov­ern­ment, unions, busi­nesses and work­ers to come to­gether and col­lec­tively chart a fu­ture where every­one can bounce back.”</p>
    <p>It is the first time the bi­en­nial con­fer­ence is be­ing held on­line.</p>
    <p>NTUC as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Melvin Yong said that work­ers were fac­ing greater stress from jug­gling work and per­sonal com­mit­ments dur­ing this pe­riod of pro­longed telecom­mut­ing work ar­range­ments. He said the ad­vi­sory will “help to re­as­sure work­ers that safe­guards are in place to sup­port their men­tal well-be­ing”.</p>
    <p>Work­place Safety and Health Coun­cil chair­man John Ng added that the ad­vi­sory will help em­ploy­ers to take proac­tive steps to look af­ter their work­ers’ men­tal health, “so that they are able to stay fo­cused at work, work safely and stay healthy”.</p>
    <p>“In turn, em­ploy­ers will ben­e­fit from a healthy and productive work­force which can con­trib­ute to bet­ter busi­ness per­for­mance,” he added.</p>
    <p>MPs and unions wel­comed yes­ter­day’s an­nounce­ment of a new tri­par­tite ad­vi­sory to look af­ter the men­tal well-be­ing of work­ers here.</p>
    <p>The ad­vi­sory comes as em­ploy­ees face greater men­tal stress and a higher risk of burnout from jug­gling work and per­sonal com­mit­ments, es­pe­cially with telecom­mut­ing work ar­range­ments due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Tri­par­tite Ad­vi­sory on Men­tal Well-be­ing at Work­places was launched by the Min­istry of Man­power, Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>NTUC as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral and Radin Mas MP Melvin Yong, who had in the past year high­lighted work­place burnout, said the ad­vi­sory re­as­sures work­ers that safe­guards are in place to sup­port their men­tal health.</p>
    <p>“It provides prac­ti­cal mea­sures that em­ploy­ers can adopt to sup­port their em­ploy­ees’ men­tal well­be­ing. The ad­vi­sory also provides a list of re­sources that em­ploy­ers, em­ploy­ees and self-em­ployed per­sons can tap,” he added.</p>
    <p>One rec­om­men­da­tion urges em­ploy­ers to es­tab­lish a work-life har­mony pol­icy to of­fer em­ploy­ees clar­ity on af­ter-hours work com­mu­ni­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Yong, who has been push­ing for a “Right to Dis­con­nect” law that would help em­ploy­ees have pro­tected time to recharge, noted that work­ers can bet­ter fo­cus on their work when they have enough rest.</p>
    <p>Fel­low NTUC as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral and labour MP Des­mond Choo, who chairs the Gov­ern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee (GPC) for Man­power, said the de­cen­tralised work­place norms, such as work­ing from home, have “dras­ti­cally re­duced tra­di­tional sup­port struc­tures” to help work­ers cope with stress.</p>
    <p>Yio Chu Kang MP Yip Hon Weng, who is a mem­ber of the GPC for Man­power, added that those who have to work from home and also deal with care­giv­ing du­ties, which in­clude look­ing af­ter their chil­dren, may find it hard to mul­ti­task.</p>
    <p>Mr Yip called on em­ploy­ers to build up their aware­ness of men­tal health mat­ters, which will al­low them to de­tect is­sues early.</p>
    <p>Unions and as­so­ci­a­tions said that with work-from-home ar­range­ments be­com­ing the new nor­mal, such a move would en­sure a healthy and productive work­force.</p>
    <p>It is rec­om­mended that em­ploy­ers pro­vide ac­cess to coun­selling ser­vices and train man­agers to spot signs of dis­tress.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore FinTech As­so­ci­a­tion pres­i­dent Chia Hock Lai said: “While there might be in­cre­men­tal cost as­so­ci­ated with such ini­tia­tives, they are also likely to re­sult in more en­gaged and men­tally health­ier em­ploy­ees, which would trans­late into more sus­tain­able pro­duc­tiv­ity gains for the com­pa­nies.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Hu­man Re­sources In­sti­tute pres­i­dent Low Peck Kem added: “When an or­gan­i­sa­tion looks af­ter its em­ploy­ees, it’ll re­flect pos­i­tively on its busi­ness. Hence, pay­ing at­ten­tion to an or­gan­i­sa­tion’s men­tal well­ness is a busi­ness im­per­a­tive, and not just nice to have.”</p>
