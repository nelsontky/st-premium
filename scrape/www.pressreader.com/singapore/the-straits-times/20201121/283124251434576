    <p>One of the big­gest reper­cus­sions of the Covid-19 pan­demic on Sin­ga­pore­ans has been job se­cu­rity. Ac­cord­ing to fig­ures re­leased by the Min­istry of Man­power last month, there were about 112,500 un­em­ployed res­i­dents in Septem­ber, of whom 97,700 were Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Although the unem­ploy­ment rate is sta­bil­is­ing, ex­perts told The Straits Times that they ex­pect tens of thou­sands of jobs here to be cut over the next two quarters as mea­sures such as the Jobs Sup­port Scheme end.</p>
    <p>Yet, amid the gloomy job mar­ket, some sec­tors are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing man­power short­ages. One of them is the se­cu­rity in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Pri­vate se­cu­rity of­fi­cers and aux­il­iary po­lice of­fi­cers sup­port the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs and Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force in keep­ing Sin­ga­pore safe and se­cure. Pri­vate se­cu­rity of­fi­cers pro­tect as­signed in­dus­trial, res­i­den­tial and com­mer­cial ar­eas, ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions and gov­ern­ment build­ings. As for aux­il­iary po­lice of­fi­cers, their du­ties in­clude safe­guard­ing premises from se­cu­rity threats, as well as crowd con­trol and traf­fic man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Higher salaries</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has in­creased the de­mand for se­cu­rity of­fi­cers as more of them are needed for an­cil­lary roles, in­clud­ing front­line work at pub­lic places such as malls and of­fices.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Se­cu­rity As­so­ci­a­tion Sin­ga­pore, this 10 per cent to 20 per cent in­crease in de­mand has boosted the salaries of se­cu­rity of­fi­cers. A Straits Times re­port showed that an ad­ver­tise­ment posted on­line for se­cu­rity of­fi­cers in “green zone” dor­mi­to­ries of­fered a gross monthly salary of $3,200. Green zone dor­mi­to­ries house mi­grant work­ers who have been cleared of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore the pan­demic, the me­dian ba­sic pay of se­cu­rity of­fi­cers had gone up. A sur­vey by the Union of Se­cu­rity Em­ploy­ees and the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences be­tween Jan­uary and Fe­bru­ary found that the me­dian ba­sic pay had in­creased by $120 to $1,420 a month com­pared with two years ago. With over­time pay and al­lowances, the me­dian take-home pay for se­cu­rity of­fi­cers was $1,975. Salaries in the se­cu­rity in­dus­try come un­der the Pro­gres­sive Wage Model, in which the low­est-rank­ing of­fi­cers must be paid a ba­sic wage of at least $1,250 this year. In 2024, the ba­sic wage of these se­cu­rity of­fi­cers will in­crease to $1,530, based on a min­i­mum 3 per cent in­crease.</p>
    <p>Trans­for­ma­tion and reskilling</p>
    <p>The sec­tor is also un­der­go­ing trans­for­ma­tion to adopt dig­i­tal so­lu­tions for greater pro­duc­tiv­ity and en­hanced se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>This is why com­pa­nies like Ae­tos have sent their se­cu­rity of­fi­cers for train­ing pro­grammes to pick up skills such as dig­i­tal savvi­ness, emer­gency re­sponse, first aid, cus­tomer ser­vice and fa­cil­i­ties man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>A wide range of ini­tia­tives are in place for in­di­vid­u­als in­ter­ested in gain­ing skills for the se­cu­rity in­dus­try. The Pro­fes­sional Con­ver­sion Pro­gramme for Aux­il­iary Po­lice Of­fi­cers is one such ini­tia­tive to as­sist pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians in reskilling to be­come of­fi­cers that help safe­guard the coun­try’s se­cu­rity. Upon com­ple­tion of the train­ing pro­gramme, can­di­dates will re­ceive a Higher Cer­tifi­cate in Armed Se­cu­rity Op­er­a­tions, which will qual­ify them to per­form guard and pa­trol op­er­a­tions, con­duct checks and se­cu­rity en­force­ment, as well as pro­vide armed re­sponse to threats.</p>
