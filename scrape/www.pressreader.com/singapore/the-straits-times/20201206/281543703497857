    <p>For some fam­i­lies cel­e­brat­ing Christ­mas, hav­ing a real tree to put presents un­der is at the top of their wish list.</p>
    <p>But those pin­ing for some fes­tive fo­liage to spruce up their homes this year may be dis­ap­pointed.</p>
    <p>With Covid-19 curb­ing leisure travel and caus­ing ship­ment de­lays, de­mand for Christ­mas trees seems to be out­strip­ping sup­ply.</p>
    <p>At least six out of nine nurs­eries and re­tail­ers that The Sun­day Times spoke to last week said their Christ­mas trees were sold out.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers had been left with very lim­ited stock.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Dairy Farm, which over­sees Cold Stor­age, said trees were still avail­able in stores, although they were sell­ing out quickly.</p>
    <p>Ikea Sin­ga­pore also said its live Christ­mas trees at its out­lets in Alexan­dra and Tampines had sold</p>
    <p>out in less than two weeks.</p>
    <p>Corona Florist & Nurs­ery re­ceived 10 to 15 in­quiries on a daily ba­sis last month, with 40 cus­tomers vy­ing for the last 10 trees avail­able last Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Ivan Wee, 40, re­tail man­ager of Is­land Land­scape & Nurs­ery, said its stock of 500 trees was sold out within two days.</p>
    <p>The over­whelm­ing de­mand for Christ­mas trees has taken nurs­eries by sur­prise.</p>
    <p>Many, in­clud­ing Far East Flora, Is­land Land­scape & Nurs­ery and Ji Mei Flower, brought in a sim­i­lar num­ber of trees last year.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Na­tional Parks Board, close to 9,900 Christ­mas trees had been im­ported into Sin­ga­pore as at last Mon­day, a slight in­crease on the 9,800 im­ported in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pected re­duced de­mand due to Covid-19,” said Ms Sharon Goh, direc­tor of Candy Flori­cul­ture, who is in her 60s. “But it seems as if every res­i­dent has started buy­ing a tree, since they are stay­ing in Sin­ga­pore and not able to travel.”</p>
    <p>Sup­ply bot­tle­necks brought about by Covid-19 may also be putting cus­tomers at risk of miss­ing out on their Christ­mas trees.</p>
    <p>“We or­dered about 200 trees this year but a por­tion had to be re­turned to our sup­pli­ers,” said Mr Cedric Tay, 26, a shop as­sis­tant at Song Lang Gar­den.</p>
    <p>“The trees had spent too long in the con­tain­ers and were not in op­ti­mal con­di­tion,” he ex­plained.</p>
    <p>Christ­mas trees are the lat­est ca­su­alty of a Covid-19 ship­ping cri­sis that is caus­ing de­lays in ship­ment.</p>
    <p>Ports around the world are see­ing ships docking longer than in pre-pan­demic times, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Goh Puay Guan from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness School.</p>
    <p>“The port con­ges­tion could oc­cur for var­i­ous rea­sons, such as safe work mea­sures that might re­duce the num­ber of work­ers al­lowed,” he added.</p>
    <p>In­spec­tions of cargo or crew could also slow down the ship­ping process.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, de­mand for ship­ping is on the rise due to var­i­ous fac­tors, such as re­tail­ers that have started re­stock­ing in­ven­tory for the hol­i­day shop­ping sea­son, said Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of op­er­a­tions man­age­ment Onur Boy­a­batli.</p>
    <p>Even so, ves­sels may not be able to scale up their ship­ment vol­ume in time for Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>“At the be­gin­ning of the pan­demic, due to huge slumps in ocean freight de­mand, the car­ri­ers dras­ti­cally re­duced ves­sel ca­pac­ity. They over­did it and... are try­ing to in­crease ca­pac­ity... but it takes time,” said Prof Boy­a­batli.</p>
    <p>These chal­lenges have not de­terred some cus­tomers from hunt­ing down a Christ­mas tree to deck the halls ahead of Dec 25.</p>
    <p>Buy­ing a tree is a yearly rit­ual for Aus­tralian Alex Rankin and his wife, who are spend­ing Christ­mas here this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Rankin, 34, who works in the tech­nol­ogy in­dus­try, had to shelve plans to visit fam­ily in Hong Kong af­ter the Sin­ga­pore-Hong Kong travel bub­ble was de­layed un­til next year.</p>
    <p>“At the nurs­eries we vis­ited, there were lines of trees that had been re­served,” he said. “We even joined What­sApp groups of 50 or more peo­ple to hunt down a tree.”</p>
    <p>Ms Janie Wong, mar­ket­ing man­ager of Ji Mei Flower, said de­mand has def­i­nitely in­creased as more peo­ple, in­clud­ing ex­pa­tri­ates, re­main in Sin­ga­pore due to travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the uptick in de­mand from in­di­vid­u­als is wel­come at a time when nurs­eries are see­ing fewer cor­po­rate cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>“Many ho­tels (are) turn­ing into stay-home no­tice lo­ca­tions, so they do not elab­o­rately dec­o­rate the ho­tels,” said Ms Goh of Candy Flori­cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Ms Grace­lyn Lin, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Sing See Soon Flo­ral & Land­scape, said: “Due to the un­cer­tainty of when phase three will be­gin, many ho­tels and restau­rants have been un­able to bud­get how much they wanted to spend on dec­o­rat­ing their premises, with many only de­cid­ing now to re­quest Christ­mas trees.”</p>
    <p>Ms Zenn Soon, 38, did not orig­i­nally plan to buy a Christ­mas tree to dec­o­rate her cafe, Wakey Wakey, which she co-owns. She de­cided to do so af­ter many of her cus­tomers re­quested one and even of­fered to dress the tree up.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one needs a bit of Christ­mas cheer,” she said. “It’s been a dif­fi­cult year.”</p>
