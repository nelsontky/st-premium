    <p>BRIS­BANE Aus­tralian fire­fight­ers are strug­gling to con­trol a mas­sive bush fire that had al­ready de­stroyed 40 per cent of the Unesco world her­itage listed Fraser Is­land be­fore a heat­wave hit yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The fire on the world’s largest sand is­land, off Aus­tralia’s east coast, has been rag­ing for more than six weeks and is con­sum­ing large swathes of the is­land’s unique forests.</p>
    <p>Tem­per­a­tures were set to peak at 34 deg C yes­ter­day as a heat­wave sweeps across the re­gion, rais­ing con­cerns that hot­ter con­di­tions will fur­ther fuel the blaze.</p>
    <p>“The veg­e­ta­tion on Fraser Is­land is ex­tremely dry and be­cause it’s so dry it’s there­fore very easy to ig­nite,” in­ci­dent con­troller James Haig told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>About two-thirds of Queens­land state, in­clud­ing Fraser Is­land, is cur­rently gripped by drought.</p>
    <p>A re­cent re­port from the na­tion’s top sci­ence and me­te­o­rol­ogy agen­cies says cli­mate change is fu­elling more ex­treme droughts, bush fires and cy­clones in Aus­tralia – a sit­u­a­tion which will only worsen as tem­per­a­tures con­tinue to rise.</p>
    <p>Fire­fight­ers are not only bat­tling “very chal­leng­ing weather con­di­tions”, Mr Haig said, but are stymied by lim­ited ac­cess to the blaze in the is­land’s re­mote north.</p>
    <p>Queens­land Parks and Wildlife Ser­vice said the fire was burn­ing on two fronts across 74,000ha – or 42 per cent of the is­land – but was not threat­en­ing prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>How­ever, as the fire has inched closer to set­tle­ments in re­cent days, the au­thor­i­ties have banned new vis­i­tors from trav­el­ling to the pop­u­lar hol­i­day des­ti­na­tion, and re­stricted ferry ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Mr Haig said as many as 10 wa­ter bomb­ing air­craft had been de­ployed to fight the fire, in­clud­ing some tasked with pro­tect­ing cul­tur­ally sig­nif­i­cant Abo­rig­i­nal sites.</p>
    <p>Planes dropped about 250,000 litres of wa­ter last Satur­day alone, al­though Mr Haig said th­ese ef­forts “will not stop the fire” but merely slow its progress.</p>
    <p>“We re­ally need rain and we’re un­for­tu­nately not likely to re­ceive it for some time,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Queens­land Fire and Emer­gency Ser­vice has im­posed a seven-day fire ban in the area start­ing late yes­ter­day, as fire­fight­ers pre­pare for an ex­tended stretch of dif­fi­cult weather con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Fraser Is­land was listed as a world her­itage site for its rain­forests, fresh­wa­ter dune lakes and com­plex sys­tem of sand dunes that are still evolv­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Haig said fire­fight­ers were try­ing to bal­ance their man­age­ment of the blaze – which is be­lieved to have been sparked by an il­le­gal camp­fire – with the need to avoid in­flict­ing any fur­ther en­vi­ron­men­tal dam­age.</p>
    <p>More than 50 bush fires were burn­ing across New South Wales state yes­ter­day, where a re­turn to heat­wave con­di­tions is fore­cast for to­day.</p>
