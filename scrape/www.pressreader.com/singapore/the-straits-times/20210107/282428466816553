    <p>LON­DON • Amer­i­can Sam Quer­rey, who was sanc­tioned by the ATP Tour for breach­ing Covid-19 pro­to­cols at the St Peters­burg Open in Oc­to­ber, has de­fended his ac­tions, say­ing he did what he felt was right as a fa­ther and a hus­band.</p>
    <p>The world No. 56 left Rus­sia in a pri­vate jet with his wife and baby son af­ter all three tested pos­i­tive for the virus be­fore the start of the ten­nis tour­na­ment, sneak­ing out of their ho­tel early in the morn­ing with­out in­form­ing re­cep­tion.</p>
    <p>The ATP last week handed him a sus­pended US$20,000 (S$26,300) fine which will be lifted if Quer­rey does not com­mit fur­ther breaches of health and safety pro­to­cols re­lated to Covid-19 within a pro­ba­tion­ary six-month pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“I... had to make a de­ci­sion be­tween 10pm and 10am the next day,” he told Sports Il­lus­trated.</p>
    <p>“I had my wife there, and I had my baby there, and as a hu­man de­ci­sion, I was like, ‘Hey, I don’t feel com­fort­able with this.’ So we made the de­ci­sion to char­ter a plane and leave.”</p>
    <p>Quer­rey, 33, said he was ready to quar­an­tine in the tour­na­ment ho­tel for two weeks af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive but af­ter two days, he was told he was no longer wel­come at the ho­tel and doc­tors would de­ter­mine if they had to quar­an­tine in a hos­pi­tal in­stead.</p>
    <p>He added the lack of clar­ity made it nec­es­sary for him, his wife, and their seven-month-old son to fly to Lon­don and quar­an­tine at an Airbnb ac­com­mo­da­tion.</p>
    <p>“I felt as a fa­ther and a hus­band, there’s a hu­man el­e­ment to this and I had to do what I feel like is right,” Quer­rey said, adding that the flight cost him over US$40,000 while he also had to pay for the two-week stay in Lon­don.</p>
    <p>“I wasn’t will­ing to let our fam­ily go to a hos­pi­tal for a min­i­mum of two weeks where we were at.”</p>
    <p>The me­dia cov­er­age of the in­ci­dent, how­ever, left him “frus­trated”. He said: “It made it seem like I just got Covid and bounced. I didn’t feel how it was por­trayed af­ter that was fair.”</p>
