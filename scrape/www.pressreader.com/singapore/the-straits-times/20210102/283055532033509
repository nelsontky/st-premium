    <p>GIGI LEUNG TAKES UP THE PASTRY</p>
    <p>CHAL­LENGE: Amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, Hong Kong actress-singer Gigi Leung kept her­self busy by tak­ing lessons in paint­ing, pot­tery and bak­ery.</p>
    <p>The 44-year-old said last July she had be­come a full-time stu­dent in a pastry pro­gramme at a culi­nary school in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, she wrote on so­cial me­dia that she had com­pleted the course and posted sev­eral pho­tos with her in­struc­tors and course mates.</p>
    <p>She wrote in Chi­nese: “One of the big­gest challenges I set for my­self in 2020 was to take part in the Dis­ci­ples Es­coffier Diploma in Pastry. The full-time course in­cludes kitchen in­tern­ships, kitchen man­age­ment and the­o­ret­i­cal lessons.</p>
    <p>“While tak­ing the fun­da­men­tal-level se­mes­ter exam, I stayed at home for sev­eral days prac­tis­ing the recipes and read­ing up. It felt like the pres­sure dur­ing my school days.</p>
    <p>“For­tu­nately, I can fi­nally say to Sofia, who has been ne­glected by me and could not play with me for sev­eral days, ‘ Daugh­ter, I have made it.’”</p>
    <p>Leung is mar­ried to Span­ish en­tre­pre­neur Ser­gio Cre­spo Gutes and Sofia is their five-year-old daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>The singer also posted pho­tos of her­self in ac­tion and the pas­tries she had made.</p>
    <p>She noted: “You will never know how far you can go if you do not take the first step.</p>
    <p>“I have never imag­ined my­self tak­ing up the chal­lenge of mak­ing ex­quis­ite French pas­tries, deal­ing with the in­tense rhythm in the kitchen, where ev­ery se­cond counts and the pres­sure of full-time stud­ies and ex­ams.”</p>
    <p>She added that she planned to chal­lenge her­self with more dif­fi­cult recipes in the next se­mes­ter.</p>
