    <p>Early this month, in­terim Congress party pres­i­dent So­nia Gandhi de­cided against cel­e­brat­ing her birth­day to show sol­i­dar­ity with the farm­ers who have sur­rounded the cap­i­tal, New Delhi, in protest against re­cently passed farm laws.</p>
    <p>All the state units of the party were asked to re­frain from cel­e­brat­ing Mrs Gandhi’s birth­day on Dec 9.</p>
    <p>But the move, clearly aimed at gain­ing some po­lit­i­cal mileage, had lit­tle im­pact on pub­lic opin­ion.</p>
    <p>Congress, which suf­fered back-to-back gen­eral elec­tion de­feats in 2014 and last year, has been lurch­ing from one cri­sis to an­other, and the fam­ily that has held an iron grip over a party that once dom­i­nated In­dian pol­i­tics is fac­ing flak for its de­cline.</p>
    <p>The party also per­formed poorly in re­cent elec­tions in Bi­har and in lo­cal elec­tions in the south­ern state of Ker­ala.</p>
    <p>Ques­tions are now be­ing raised over whether the Gandhi fam­ily needs to take a step back af­ter Mr Rahul Gandhi quit as Congress pres­i­dent, a post he va­cated on moral grounds af­ter the drub­bing at the 2019 gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>He has so far re­fused to re­turn as party leader.</p>
    <p>His ail­ing mother, Mrs Gandhi, has had to step in as party pres­i­dent in the mean­time.</p>
    <p>The Gandhi fam­ily has made an im­pres­sive stamp on In­dian po­lit­i­cal his­tory.</p>
    <p>Mrs Gandhi is the wife of for­mer prime min­is­ter Ra­jiv Gandhi, who was as­sas­si­nated, just like Mrs Indira Gandhi, his long-serv­ing mother whom he had suc­ceeded af­ter her death. Mrs Indira Gandhi was the daugh­ter of the coun­try’s first prime min­is­ter, Mr Jawa­har­lal Nehru.</p>
    <p>Se­nior po­lit­i­cal com­men­ta­tor Neerja Chowd­hury said: “The value the Gandhi fam­ily brought (to the party) was the abil­ity to win elec­tions. To­day, that is not hap­pen­ing. So there is a sense among many peo­ple in the party that Rahul is say­ing the right things, he is tak­ing on the Prime Min­is­ter and the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party), but he does not con­nect with the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>“There­fore, the mo­ment you put Rahul ver­sus PM Naren­dra Modi, it goes to the ad­van­tage of Modi.”</p>
    <p>She added: “From the fam­ily side, Mrs Gandhi would like Rahul and only Rahul to be pres­i­dent... It’s like the whole thing has got­ten stuck and the party is los­ing ground.”</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, frus­tra­tion with the drift in Congress spilled into the open. Twenty-three prom­i­nent party lead­ers, in­clud­ing Mr Kapil Sibal, Mr Shashi Tha­roor and Mr Ghu­lam Nabi Azad, drafted a let­ter to Mrs Gandhi in which they lamented the lead­er­ship cri­sis and com­plained about infighting, de­mor­alised cadres and the fail­ure to nurture young lead­ers.</p>
    <p>“The un­cer­tainty over the lead­er­ship and the drift has de­mor­alised the Congress work­ers and fur­ther weak­ened the party. There has been an ero­sion of the sup­port base with lead­ers and func­tionar­ies leav­ing the party in a num­ber of states,” the lead­ers stated in the let­ter.</p>
    <p>“Even af­ter 14 months from the 2019 elec­toral ver­dict, the Congress party has not un­der­taken any hon­est in­tro­spec­tion to an­a­lyse the rea­sons for its con­tin­ued de­cline.”</p>
    <p>The writ­ers were ini­tially vil­i­fied as dis­senters, but last Satur­day, Mrs Gandhi and her two chil­dren Rahul and Priyanka held talks with seven of the lead­ers.</p>
    <p>They dis­cussed the prob­lems fac­ing the party and the need for a vis­i­ble lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>The Gandhi fam­ily, who also plan to meet the re­main­ing lead­ers, promised to hold an elec­tion for the post of party pres­i­dent soon.</p>
    <p>Spec­u­la­tion is rife that Mr Gandhi may re­turn to the post.</p>
    <p>Still, the cri­sis for the Gandhi fam­ily is far from over as the rul­ing BJP led by Mr Modi has gone from strength to strength.</p>
    <p>Congress not only needs to set its house in or­der, but it also needs to take on a prime min­is­ter whose pop­u­lar­ity has re­mained in­tact through a global pan­demic and slow­ing eco­nomic growth.</p>
    <p>Many be­lieve Mr Gandhi is not up to the task.</p>
    <p>For­mer United States pres­i­dent Barack Obama, in his just pub­lished mem­oir, wrote that Mr Gandhi had a “ner­vous, un­formed qual­ity about him, as if he were a stu­dent who’d done the course work and was ea­ger to im­press the teacher but deep down lacked ei­ther the ap­ti­tude or the pas­sion to mas­ter the sub­ject”.</p>
    <p>But the co­nun­drum fac­ing Congress is that the Gandhi fam­ily is seen to be the glue that holds the party to­gether.</p>
    <p>With­out the Gand­his, many be­lieve it will dis­solve to sat­isfy com­pet­ing am­bi­tions.</p>
    <p>Jour­nal­ist and au­thor Rasheed Kid­wai said: “I think there is ut­ter con­fu­sion and chaos. The</p>
    <p>Congress story is go­ing round and round.</p>
    <p>“But Congress is los­ing the bat­tle of per­cep­tion. The bulk of mil­len­nium chil­dren are not ac­cept­ing Rahul. The dy­nasty is out of sync with re­al­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>Ms Chowd­hury be­lieves the op­tion be­fore the fam­ily is to take a step back for the time be­ing.</p>
    <p>“If you could get some­body other than the Gandhi fam­ily, but with their back­ing, that would be the ideal sce­nario,” she said.</p>
    <p>“For the mo­ment, you don’t need a flam­boy­ant leader. You need a leader who can build the or­gan­i­sa­tion painstak­ingly, state af­ter state, some­one who can bring in en­ergy and boost the morale of cadres.</p>
    <p>“It must be some­one with an un­der­stand­ing of the sys­tem, the party and what is hap­pen­ing in the coun­try. There is no lack of such lead­ers within Congress.”</p>
