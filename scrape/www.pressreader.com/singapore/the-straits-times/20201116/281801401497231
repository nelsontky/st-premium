    <p>CHEN­NAI/NEW DELHI Hun­dreds of mil­lions of In­di­ans in north In­dia woke up yes­ter­day to toxic air fol­low­ing Deep­avali, the Hindu fes­ti­val of lights, after many rev­ellers de­fied bans on us­ing fire­crack­ers to cel­e­brate the event.</p>
    <p>The cap­i­tal New Delhi was blan­keted in a thick haze, with the av­er­age pol­lu­tion level over nine times what is con­sid­ered safe by the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Delhi’s Chief Min­is­ter Arvind Ke­jri­wal had banned the use and sale of fire­crack­ers ahead of Deep­avali, but the pol­icy has been dif­fi­cult to im­ple­ment.</p>
    <p>Rev­ellers in the cap­i­tal let off huge amounts of fire­works well into yes­ter­day morn­ing, prompt­ing an­gry res­i­dents and en­vi­ron­men­tal­ists to com­plain on so­cial me­dia of breath­ing dif­fi­cul­ties and sting­ing eyes.</p>
    <p>“Our gods must be so happy to­day, that their fol­low­ers burst fire­crack­ers and choked the young ones to de­spair and death,” said Mr Vim­lendu Jha, the founder of non­profit en­vi­ron­men­tal group Swechha.</p>
    <p>Some de­fended fire­crack­ers as an es­sen­tial part of a re­li­gious tra­di­tion cel­e­brated by mil­lions across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“Are you real­is­ing how all of In­dia, all places stood up in de­fi­ance against the cracker ban? It’s like a form of Hindu-free­dom bat­tle cry,” Mr Tarun Vijay, a leader of Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, tweeted.</p>
    <p>New Delhi’s air pol­lu­tion typ­i­cally wors­ens in Oc­to­ber and November be­cause of farm­ers who burn agri­cul­tural waste, coal-fired power plants, con­gested traf­fic and wind­less days.</p>
    <p>The rag­ing coro­n­avirus epi­demic, with more than 400,000 cases in the city of 20 mil­lion peo­ple, has also height­ened alarm over the smog. Doc­tors have warned of a sharp in­crease in res­pi­ra­tory ill­nesses.</p>
    <p>The metropo­lis has been record­ing higher-than-usual daily rises in new cases, and re­ported 7,340 fresh in­fec­tions late last Satur­day. Chief Min­is­ter Ke­jri­wal was ex­pected to meet na­tional Home Min­is­ter Amit Shah later yes­ter­day to ask for more hospi­tal beds to cope with the spike, lo­cal me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s Covid-19 tally stood at more than 8.8 mil­lion yes­ter­day as over 41,000 new daily cases were reg­is­tered. The death toll na­tion­wide to­talled 129,635, ac­cord­ing to the health min­istry.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, be­sides New Delhi, cities in the states of Pun­jab, Ut­tar Pradesh, Haryana and Bi­har – which have al­ready been suf­fer­ing from some of the worst air in the world – saw even higher lev­els of pol­lu­tion than on the morn­ing after Deep­avali last year, gov­ern­ment data an­a­lysed by Reuters showed.</p>
    <p>An av­er­age of air qual­ity in­dices mea­sured at dif­fer­ent places within the ma­jor cities in these states was higher than last year, ac­cord­ing to data from the Cen­tral Pol­lu­tion Con­trol Board.</p>
