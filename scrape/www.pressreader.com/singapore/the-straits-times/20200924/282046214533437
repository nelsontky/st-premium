    <p>In­done­sian Parti Liyani was ini­tially charged in 2018 with steal­ing items worth more than $50,000 from then Changi Air­port Group chair­man Liew Mun Leong and his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>The items were al­legedly found in three boxes that Ms Parti had packed af­ter she was sacked on Oct 28, 2016.</p>
    <p>She con­tested the four charges in a 22-day trial, say­ing that the items were ei­ther bought by her, given to her, dis­carded and found by her, or had been put into the boxes by some­one else.</p>
    <p>In March last year, a dis­trict judge found her guilty and handed down a 26-month jail sen­tence.</p>
    <p>The judge re­moved two wal­lets and five items of cloth­ing from the charges, as there was doubt over whether they be­longed to Mr Liew’s son Karl, and low­ered the value of the items to about $34,000.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti ap­pealed to the High Court, which ac­quit­ted her on Sept 4.</p>
    <p>On Sept 8, she was cleared of a fifth charge of fraud­u­lent pos­ses­sion of prop­erty, mak­ing her free of all crim­i­nal charges.</p>
