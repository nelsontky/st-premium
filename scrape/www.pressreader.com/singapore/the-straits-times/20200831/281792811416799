    <p>NEW YORK/FRANK­FURT • It was the head of Sin­ga­pore’s mon­e­tary author­ity who best summed up the big­gest fear grip­ping the vir­tual Jack­son Hole con­fer­ence this year.</p>
    <p>“We are not go­ing back to the same world,” warned Se­nior Min­is­ter Tharman Shanmugara­tnam, who is in charge of the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“We’ve got to avoid a pro­longed pe­riod of high lev­els of un­em­ploy­ment, and it’s a very real prospect. It is not at all as­sured that we will get a re­turn of tight labour mar­kets even with tra­di­tional macroe­co­nomic pol­icy be­ing prop­erly ap­plied.”</p>
    <p>The no­tion that cen­tral bankers need to face the re­al­ity of per­ma­nent up­heaval and long-term eco­nomic dam­age by de­ploy­ing new tools and dovish poli­cies was the main theme of the United States Fed­eral Re­serve’s flag­ship an­nual event.</p>
    <p>Among the re­search papers un­veiled at Jack­son Hole, one pre­sented by Columbia Univer­sity’s Dr Laura Veld­kamp sug­gested the coro­n­avirus pan­demic was, like the fi­nan­cial cri­sis, a “tail event” likely to trans­form the be­hav­iour of con­sumers and busi­ness for years to come.</p>
    <p>An­other, by Dr Ni­cholas Bloom of Stan­ford Univer­sity, fo­cused on the ad­verse im­pact of the un­cer­tainty cre­ated by the Covid-19 out­break around the globe, call­ing it “a ma­jor im­ped­i­ment to a rapid re­cov­ery”.</p>
    <p>Against this back­drop, top pol­i­cy­mak­ers dis­cussed their own strate­gies in ad­dress­ing the cri­sis and its fall­out. Fed chair Jay Pow­ell be­gan by an­nounc­ing a long-term strat­egy for the US cen­tral bank that in­cludes a much more le­nient ap­proach to in­fla­tion – an av­er­age 2 per cent tar­get that will al­low some over­shoot­ing, cou­pled with a more dogged fo­cus on achiev­ing the tight­est-pos­si­ble labour mar­kets.</p>
    <p>This is likely to keep in­ter­est rates close to zero for a long time, pos­si­bly many years. “The eco­nomic ques­tion we had to an­swer was how to adapt our frame­work to what we re­ally had learnt since the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, dur­ing that long ex­pan­sion,” Mr Pow­ell said.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear how far the Fed’s move will serve as a model for oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Cen­tral Bank (ECB) is con­duct­ing a strate­gic re­view of its own. This has been ex­tended un­til the mid­dle of next year and is now likely to be sub­ject to ex­tra pres­sure to fol­low the Fed’s lead by con­sid­er­ing whether to adopt its own av­er­age in­fla­tion tar­get­ing.</p>
    <p>Two mem­bers of the ECB gov­ern­ing coun­cil said it was likely to con­sider such a move.</p>
    <p>But they added that the idea would prob­a­bly be op­posed by some of the more hawk­ish coun­cil mem­bers such as Mr Jens Wei­d­mann, head of Ger­many’s Bun­des­bank, which is renowned for be­ing deeply fear­ful of run­away in­fla­tion.</p>
    <p>“I think we will look at it,” said one ECB coun­cil mem­ber. “But the idea of a sub­stan­tial over­shoot­ing on in­fla­tion leads to a worry that the gov­ern­ing coun­cil would not have the moral fi­bre to ad­just in­ter­est rates enough to cor­rect it – so yes, the Bun­des­bank will be ner­vous about the idea.”</p>
    <p>French in­surer AXA’s chief econ­o­mist Gilles Moec said: “The prob­lem for the ECB is, once again, how does it po­si­tion it­self rel­a­tive to the Fed? This gives the im­pres­sion that the Fed is ahead of the curve and it is an is­sue that I think the ECB would pre­fer not to have to deal with right now.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Bank of Eng­land (BOE) gover­nor An­drew Bailey dis­puted the no­tion that cen­tral banks were run­ning out of am­mu­ni­tion in the cri­sis. “We are not out of fire­power by any means and, to be hon­est, it looks from to­day’s van­tage point that we were too cau­tious about our re­main­ing fire­power preCovid-19.”</p>
    <p>He also sug­gested that it would be crit­i­cal for the BOE to pre­serve room to use its bal­ance sheet ag­gres­sively in the next cri­sis, which might mean shrink­ing it ahead of any fu­ture in­ter­est rate rises.</p>
    <p>MIT eco­nomics pro­fes­sor Kristin Forbes said: “Bailey’s ar­gu­ment was that (quan­ti­ta­tive eas­ing) is a re­ally pow­er­ful tool, es­pe­cially when mar­kets are dis­or­derly – so some weight should be put on re­duc­ing bal­ance sheets so at the end we have space to start buy­ing again. No one’s re­ally made that ar­gu­ment the same way.”</p>
    <p>Some in the au­di­ence dis­puted the gloomy pre­dic­tions of a longterm eco­nomic hit from the pan­demic, sug­gest­ing it was at odds with the re­cent rally in eq­uity mar­kets, as well as some ev­i­dence of a swifter re­bound than feared.</p>
    <p>Gold­man Sachs chief econ­o­mist Jan Hatz­ius said: “There’s a risk that we are over­do­ing the gloom and doom and that we will ul­ti­mately find that this huge eco­nomic hit will be much more tem­po­rary than in­cor­po­rated in most fore­casts.”</p>
    <p>But one key fac­tor that oc­ca­sion­ally en­tered the dis­cus­sions and is top of mind for many pol­i­cy­mak­ers is the need for fis­cal pol­icy to re­main ag­gres­sive to sup­port mon­e­tary pol­icy actions, en­sure de­mand does not col­lapse, and mit­i­gate any height</p>
    <p>FAC­ING THE NEW RE­AL­ITY</p>
    <p>We are not go­ing back to the same world... We’ve got to avoid a pro­longed pe­riod of high lev­els of un­em­ploy­ment, and it’s a very real prospect.</p>
    <p>It is not at all as­sured that we will get a re­turn of tight labour mar­kets even with tra­di­tional macroe­co­nomic pol­icy ’’ be­ing prop­erly ap­plied. SE­NIOR MIN­IS­TER THARMAN SHANMUGARA­TNAM, who is also Sin­ga­pore’s Co­or­di­nat­ing</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for So­cial Poli­cies and chair­man of the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>ened in­equal­ity due to the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>In the US, in par­tic­u­lar, mas­sive ini­tial fis­cal sup­port has waned sig­nif­i­cantly in re­cent months and is in danger of evap­o­rat­ing com­pletely if a new re­lief pack­age is not ap­proved.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment chief econ­o­mist Lau­rence Boone said: “We can­not af­ford at the cur­rent junc­ture a re­peat of the fis­cal tight­en­ing that we saw in the great fi­nan­cial cri­sis.”</p>

Demon&#xAD;stra&#xAD;tions have been far fewer and smaller than the mass protests that rocked the Chi&#xAD;nese-ruled city in the sec&#xAD;ond half of last year, largely be&#xAD;cause of coro&#xAD;n&#xAD;avirus&#xAD;re&#xAD;lated re&#xAD;stric&#xAD;tions on gath&#xAD;er&#xAD;ings and the im&#xAD;pact of the new na&#xAD;tional se&#xAD;cu&#xAD;rity law, an&#xAD;a&#xAD;lysts say.</p>
