        <p>Ex­pelled from Queensway Sec­ondary School a decade ago, then sen­tenced to eight years’ jail in 2018 for drug-re­lated of­fences, David (not his real name) could not stop the down­ward spi­ral.</p>
        <p>All that changed when he was given a shot at tak­ing the O-level ex­ams while in prison. On Mon­day, the 25-year-old re­ceived his re­sults – 12 points in five sub­jects, in­clud­ing As in prin­ci­ples of ac­counts, business stud­ies and math­e­mat­ics.</p>
        <p>“I wanted to try to do some­thing with my time here,” said David.</p>
        <p>He plans to take a diploma course in sup­ply chain lo­gis­tics next, but has not yet de­cided on what to do when he is re­leased.</p>
        <p>He was one of 53 in­mates across three prison in­sti­tu­tions who re­ceived their re­sults af­ter sit­ting the na­tional ex­ams last year.</p>
        <p>Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs and Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Muham­mad Faishal Ibrahim vis­ited Tanah Merah In­sti­tu­tion 1 on Tues­day to con­grat­u­late and en­cour­age the stu­dent in­mates.</p>
        <p>“Their cir­cum­stances with­out Covid-19 were al­ready tough. With Covid-19, it was even tougher, yet they per­se­vered and are able to achieve what they have today,” said Dr Faishal.</p>
        <p>The in­mates have only one year to pre­pare for the na­tional ex­ams, com­pared with stu­dents in main­stream sec­ondary schools who have at least four years.</p>
        <p>It be­came even tougher for them amid the pan­demic, es­pe­cially dur­ing last year’s cir­cuit breaker pe­riod from April to June, when teach­ers were not al­lowed into prison fa­cil­i­ties and l es­sons were con­ducted via video­con­fer­enc­ing.</p>
        <p>While wait­ing for the of­fi­cers to set up the equip­ment needed for re­mote learn­ing, such as pro­jec­tors and speak­ers, the in­mates had to study in their cells.</p>
        <p>“It was chal­leng­ing be­cause some­times there were tech­ni­cal faults, and there was also no faceto-face in­ter­ac­tion,” said David, who was booted out of school as a Sec­ondary 3 stu­dent only to end up in the Sin­ga­pore Boys’ Home mul­ti­ple times over var­i­ous of­fences.</p>
        <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, a class rep­re­sen­ta­tive was ap­pointed as a proxy, to col­late and ask ques­tions.</p>
        <p>The teach­ers also sent the in­mates as­sign­ments to be com­pleted in their cells, though they needed special au­tho­ri­sa­tion to use pens and pen­cils, be­cause in the wrong hands, these could be used as weapons.</p>
        <p>Se­nior chief warder ( SCW1) Ewen Thai, 39, who works closely</p>
        <p>with stu­dent in­mates, said: “The chal­lenges were un­prece­dented dur­ing the pan­demic. A lot of things are con­trolled in prison.”</p>
        <p>Prison of­fi­cers had to act as so­cial dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors and ex­plain what was hap­pen­ing in the world out­side, he said.</p>
        <p>With­out the teach­ers they usu­ally tap for guid­ance, the in­mates helped one another com­plete their as­sign­ments.</p>
        <p>Be­fore the pan­demic, prison school days would typ­i­cally be­gin</p>
        <p>at 8.30am and end at 3pm, five days a week.</p>
        <p>Said David: “It was up to us to de­cide how much we wanted it (to do well). No one was chas­ing us or ask­ing us to do the as­sign­ments, but I fin­ished every­thing I was given.”</p>
        <p>In­mates like Azly (not his real name) did not give up ei­ther.</p>
        <p>In­car­cer­ated in 2015 for drug-re­lated of­fences and serv­ing a 13-year sen­tence, the 35-year-old scored eight points in five sub­jects.</p>
        <p>“I was over­whelmed when I re­ceived my re­sults. I could not be­lieve I was hold­ing an O-level cer­tifi­cate, it was long over­due,” said Azly, who is di­vorced and has two chil­dren aged eight and 13.</p>
        <p>He plans to take the A lev­els this year and pur­sue ed­u­ca­tion in an in­sti­tute of higher learn­ing when he is re­leased.</p>
        <p>Mr Jef­frey Lim started teach­ing English at the prison school last year. The 42-year-old said he was sur­prised by how hard the in­mates worked to do well.</p>
        <p>“Some had not been study­ing for the long­est time, and they had to take the ex­ams in a year. But they tried their hard­est. The re­sults are sec­ondary to their jour­ney.”</p>
        <p>SCW1 Thai said that some who at­tend prison school may not be do­ing it for the cer­ti­fi­ca­tion.</p>
        <p>“Some­times, it is just to show their fam­ily that they can per­se­vere – to re­deem them­selves af­ter the mis­takes they made in the past.”</p>
