    <p>Two land parcels for farm­ing in Lim Chu Kang and Sungei Ten­gah have come on the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The more than 10,000 sq m plot in</p>
    <p>Neo Tiew Cres­cent may be used to farm food crops, seafood, quail eggs, frogs and cat­tle or goats for dairy milk, while the over 11,900 sq m plot in Sungei Ten­gah Road must be used for grow­ing veg­eta­bles.</p>
    <p>Each plot, about the size of 11/</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>foot­ball fields, comes with a 20-year lease. The tender, re­leased by the Sin­ga­pore Food Agency (SFA), will close at noon on Nov 10.</p>
    <p>This is the sixth round of agri­cul­tural land sales since 2017, as Sin­ga­pore shores up its lo­cal pro­duc­tion ca­pa­bil­i­ties in line with its “30 by 30” goal of meet­ing 30 per cent of the coun­try’s nu­tri­tional needs lo­cally by 2030.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, Hay Dairies was awarded a 10,000 sq m par­cel of agri­cul­tural land in Neo Tiew Cres­cent with a win­ning bid of $500,000.</p>
    <p>Pro­pos­als for the two plots will be as­sessed based on the farms’ pro­duc­tion ca­pa­bil­ity, track record, rel­e­vant ex­pe­ri­ence and qual­i­fi­ca­tions, as well as on in­no­va­tion, busi­ness vi­a­bil­ity and waste man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Those that can achieve high pro­duc­tion lev­els sus­tain­ably will have a higher chance of be­ing awarded the land parcels, the agency said.</p>
    <p>“With less than 1 per cent of land set aside for agri­cul­ture food pro­duc­tion, our farms have to make ef­fi­cient use of scarce re­sources such as land, water and en­ergy.”</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s farm­lands are mostly in Lim Chu Kang and Sungei Ten­gah, near Choa Chu Kang.</p>
    <p>The agency will work with agri­cul­tural in­dus­try play­ers to­wards “an ex­cit­ing vi­sion” for the Lim Chu Kang agrar­ian area, said Mr Melvin Chow, se­nior di­rec­tor of SFA’s food sup­ply re­silience di­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, farm oper­a­tors have re­quested cen­tralised fa­cil­i­ties and ser­vices, he said.</p>
    <p>The SFA is also study­ing how the area can be re­de­vel­oped to en­hance its food pro­duc­tion while in­cor­po­rat­ing cir­cu­lar econ­omy prin­ci­ples such as waste re­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>He added: “Mov­ing for­ward, the plans and sched­ule for fu­ture land ten­ders will be tai­lored to sup­port promis­ing farms in achiev­ing the high food pro­duc­tion lev­els re­quired to meet our ‘30 by 30’ goal.”</p>
