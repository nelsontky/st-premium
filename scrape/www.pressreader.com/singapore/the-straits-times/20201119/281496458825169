    <p>The first thing you see when you en­ter the home of Mr Josiah Zee is a cute mu­ral of a pile of cats on the liv­ing room wall. Peer closely and you will spot two dogs amid the fe­line frenzy, de­pic­tions of late pets be­long­ing to the home own­ers.</p>
    <p>The mu­ral, painted by artist Stephanie Raphaela Ho aka Muffin­saurs, was com­mis­sioned by Mr Zee, 33, a cor­po­rate coun­sel with a multi­na­tional com­pany, and his wife, a ju­nior col­lege teacher.</p>
    <p>He says the decor for their first mar­i­tal home was in­spired by their love of cats – they have three – as well as of beau­ti­ful things. The mu­ral was his wife’s idea and they com­mis­sioned Muffin­saurs to do the work be­cause “it’s an art style we iden­tify with”.</p>
    <p>Since that first plunge into com­mis­sion­ing home-grown artists, Mr Zee has com­mis­sioned more work. There is an­other mu­ral by Muffin­saurs in the nurs­ery for his tod­dler daugh­ter, fea­tur­ing a fly­ing pig in hon­our of his daugh­ter’s Chi­nese zo­diac sign, and he has also com­mis­sioned pot­tery stu­dio Com­mon Touch to cre­ate cus­tomised sake sets.</p>
    <p>Young HDB dwellers such as Mr Zee say com­mis­sion­ing works from artists gives their homes an un­usual decor touch. Ms Ho, 32, says she has seen more HDB flat own­ers ap­proach­ing her over the years to com­mis­sion mu­rals although these gigs have dried up over the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Ar­chi­tect Alex Tan, 34, de­signed his first mar­i­tal home to ac­com­mo­date art­work: a com­mis­sioned paint­ing by Justin Lee gets pride of place in the en­try­way of his three­room HDB apart­ment.</p>
    <p>He says laugh­ing: “When­ever we have friends and rel­a­tives com­ing over, this is al­ways a con­ver­sa­tion starter. The two fishes spark the first ques­tion, ‘Is this for good feng­shui?’”</p>
    <p>The paint­ing, which also fea­tures the Chi­nese char­ac­ter for dou­ble hap­pi­ness, ap­pealed to Mr Tan and his wife be­cause the char­ac­ter is as­so­ci­ated with wed­dings, apt for their first home, and the mo­tif of fish rep­re­sents pros­per­ity in a Chi­nese home.</p>
    <p>For the ad­ven­tur­ous home own­ers, com­mis­sion­ing work is a way to kill two birds with one stone: They get one-of-a-kind pieces for their home and sup­port home-grown tal­ent at the same time.</p>
    <p>As Mr Zee says: “It’s a way to sup­port the lo­cal arts scene. We have tal­ent who are able to make great pieces. They make things not just beau­ti­ful but also things that are func­tional to use. And they beau­tify the house.”</p>
    <p>Young buy­ers such as Mr Zee and Mr Tan are a grow­ing de­mo­graphic in Sin­ga­pore, says in­te­rior de­sign con­sul­tant Agatha Teng, 48, owner of A.rk In­te­rior De­sign. “With the younger crowd be­ing</p>
    <p>more well trav­elled and worldly, they tend to want some­thing more be­spoke for their homes,” she says.</p>
    <p>With this in mind, she has been work­ing with glass artist Tan Sock Fong to cre­ate a se­ries of glass light fixtures which dou­ble as both sculp­tures and func­tional lights.</p>
    <p>Tan Sock Fong, 53, has cre­ated ev­ery­thing from stained glass doors to room di­viders to cof­fee ta­bles over the years for clients.</p>
    <p>She says: “I can cre­ate a lot of things out of glass be­cause I un­der­stand the tech­niques. There are dif­fer­ent ef­fects I can achieve with frosted glass, or by sand­blast­ing and other meth­ods.”</p>
    <p>Prices for her pieces are also sur­pris­ingly af­ford­able, de­pend­ing on the com­plex­ity of the work. A cus­tomised cof­fee ta­ble top starts from $900 while a glass bi­fold door can cost from $700 all the way up to $4,000.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore-based French artist Ce­cile Marche, who works un­der the name of LouiseM, has cre­ated colour­ful kitchen back­splashes from $1,800 and cus­tomised mu­rals for shower stalls from $2,200.</p>
    <p>The trained en­gi­neer, 50, says: “Just be­cause it is art doesn’t mean that it has to be ex­pen­sive. My ap­proach is to make art af­ford­able so peo­ple can dec­o­rate their in­te­rior with some­thing very unique.”</p>
    <p>Ms Teng notes that much more can be done to ed­u­cate cus­tomers about such pos­si­bil­i­ties: “When I say you can cus­tomise stuff, clients get ap­pre­hen­sive be­cause they think it’s go­ing to be ex­pen­sive. It takes a lot of per­sua­sion.”</p>
    <p>One way she is hop­ing to per­suade clients is with her light fix­ture project with Tan Sock Fong: “If we make art pieces func­tional as well, it’s an eas­ier ap­proach to art.”</p>
    <p>She em­pha­sises to clients that young artists can be af­ford­able op­tions and fi­nan­cial sup­port can make a cru­cial dif­fer­ence for artists rather than just buy­ing off the shelf. “There are starv­ing artists in Sin­ga­pore you can sup­port. We have a lot of art stu­dents who give up be­cause they can­not make a liv­ing,” she says.</p>
    <p>Artists say they wel­come home decor com­mis­sions although artist Justin Lee, 57, says com­mis­sions can be “very prob­lem­atic if clients don’t know what they want”.</p>
    <p>Mr Zee and Mr Alex Tan have sim­i­lar ad­vice to of­fer to first-time com­mis­sion­ers. Both say that it is im­por­tant to be fa­mil­iar with the style of the artist one is com­mis­sion­ing, and then trust the artist to de­liver.</p>
    <p>Mr Zee says: “We know what we like, but we don’t know what we want. Let them show you what you need.</p>
    <p>“It’s like omakase. You tell the chef, ‘I don’t eat this be­cause of an al­lergy, or I don’t like this in­gre­di­ent, but then I leave the rest to you.’”</p>
    <p>Both clients and artists also ad­vise buy­ers to have a bud­get in mind. That will help set fi­nan­cial pa­ram­e­ters and ex­pec­ta­tions. Mr Alex Tan set aside about $10,000 for art for his home and that sum cov­ered Lee’s piece as well as a cou­ple of other works.</p>
    <p>Artists say lo­gis­tics is also an im­por­tant con­sid­er­a­tion. For mu­rals, for ex­am­ple, Ms Ho says: “The best time to paint a mu­ral for a new home is after the ma­jor clean­ing of the apart­ment and paint­ing touch-up.”</p>
    <p>Marche says an art­work can be com­pleted as quickly as two weeks if the client has clear ideas of what he wants.</p>
    <p>All the artists say they are happy to meet and chat with po­ten­tial clients. Com­mon Touch founders and pot­ters Fyon Cheong and Ze­stro Leow, both 26, will in­vite clients to their stu­dio to look at their works and for a con­ver­sa­tion to get things started.</p>
    <p>Marche sug­gests think­ing about themes such as “a slice of life, mem­o­ries of trav­els with kids”.</p>
    <p>“You give me words and im­ages that rep­re­sent you and I will turn them into a de­sign.”</p>
    <p>Such cus­tomi­sa­tion is the rea­son home own­ers pre­fer com­mis­sions to buy­ing off-the-shelf pieces.</p>
    <p>Mr Zee says the mu­rals in his home have sen­ti­men­tal value, mak­ing it more mean­ing­ful to the whole fam­ily: “It’s im­por­tant there’s a story be­hind it.”</p>
    <p>Dis­cus­sions with artists can also throw up al­ter­na­tives that clients might not have thought of. Tan Sock Fong, for ex­am­ple, brims with ideas for glass dream­catch­ers and colour­ful stained glass night­lights.</p>
    <p>The first step is sim­ply to look at art. As Mr Alex Tan says: “Don’t be scared. Walk into a gallery first.”</p>
    <p>Once you get started, you might not stop, as Mr Zee has dis­cov­ered. He is com­mis­sion­ing a third set of pot­tery f rom Com­mon Touch: “Get­ting a work of art can be quite ac­ces­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“Just get some­thing you like within your bud­get and you’re happy with. If you are happy us­ing it, that’s the util­ity of com­mis­sion­ing some­thing.”</p>
