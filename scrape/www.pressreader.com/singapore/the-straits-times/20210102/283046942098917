    <p>GOYANG (South Korea) • Global K-pop sen­sa­tion BTS cel­e­brated New Year’s Eve with an on­line con­cert on Thurs­day, along with other K-pop groups from their man­age­ment agency Big Hit En­ter­tain­ment and fans from around the world.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can singers Halsey and Lauv, as well as DJ Steve Aoki, who have all col­lab­o­rated with BTS in re­cent years, joined on a spe­cial stage by con­nect­ing re­motely.</p>
    <p>The seven-mem­ber BTS also took part in a short on­line fan meet­ing, read­ing mes­sages and play­ing a game, which fans could tog­gle to among mul­ti­ple screens.</p>
    <p>“I hope you wrap up the end of the year well and I’d like to see you in per­son soon,” said BTS rap­per Suga, who is re­cov­er­ing from a shoul­der surgery.</p>
    <p>The con­cert at Goyang, north­west of Seoul, was orig­i­nally sched­uled to be held si­mul­ta­ne­ously on­line and of­fline, but in­per­son at­ten­dance was can­celled due to a new wave of Covid-19 in­fec­tions in South Korea.</p>
    <p>Last year, BTS had to call off their tour of nearly 40 con­certs in Asia, Europe and the United States, which had been sched­uled to be­gin last April, as the coro­n­avirus spread around the world.</p>
    <p>They played a vir­tual con­cert last Oc­to­ber, draw­ing more than 990,000 view­ers from 191 coun­tries and fetch­ing about 50 bil­lion won (S$60.9 mil­lion) in ticket sales.</p>
    <p>With the con­cert on Thurs­day, the boy band wrapped up a record­break­ing year with three No. 1 hits on the Bill­board Hot 100 chart and be­com­ing the first K-pop group to re­ceive a Grammy Award nom­i­na­tion.</p>
