    <p>Un­til a few months ago, Ms Widya As­tuti Bo­erma knew her bi­o­log­i­cal mother only from glimpses of mem­ory.</p>
    <p>Some were pleas­ant: a mo­ment of them both at the sul­tan’s palace in Yo­gyakarta, for ex­am­ple. But oth­ers were jar­ring, in­clud­ing one in­deli­bly etched on her mind of the fam­ily’s house ablaze. And then the fi­nal one: her mother’s in­struc­tions at a Jakarta train sta­tion to “be a good girl” and go with a woman she barely knew.</p>
    <p>Ms Widya ended up in an or­phan­age. She was three.</p>
    <p>Now, 45, Ms Widya is one of a grow­ing num­ber of Dutch adoptees scram­bling to find their bi­o­log­i­cal par­ents in the wake of ex­plo­sive lo­cal me­dia re­ports, court cases and a govern­ment in­quiry into il­le­gal adop­tions.</p>
    <p>The find­ings of a two-year in­quiry into the role of Dutch govern­ment of­fi­cials, in­clud­ing some of its em­bassy staff, in fa­cil­i­tat­ing sus­pected il­le­gal adop­tions are ex­pected in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>“It made me think I wasn’t alone,” Ms Widya, who speaks Dutch, English, Ger­man and Span­ish, told The Straits Times over the phone from her home in The Hague in the Nether­lands, re­fer­ring to the con­tro­versy.</p>
    <p>“It made me won­der if I had been a vic­tim of child traf­fick­ing.”</p>
    <p>Three weeks af­ter sep­a­rat­ing from her mother, and en­dur­ing beat­ings at the or­phan­age for cry­ing, Ms Widya was adopted by a Dutch cou­ple who had flown to In­done­sia. She re­calls the or­phan­age telling her that her mother could not care for her and that if she protested, her new par­ents would send her back to the or­phan­age.</p>
    <p>In June, an In­done­sian-speak­ing col­league posted de­tails of Ms Widya’s case on Twit­ter. The post got 3,500 retweets and at­tracted a sud­den flurry of at­ten­tion from In­done­sian me­dia.</p>
    <p>And on June 17, the day af­ter an in­ter­view with an In­done­sian tele­vi­sion net­work in which Ms Widya re­counted de­tails of the house fire, her col­league re­ceived a direct mes­sage from the daugh­ter of a woman named Suy­atni.</p>
    <p>The 58-year-old woman, who was mar­ried at 12 to a man in his early 30s, was born in Yo­gyakarta and had worked as a house­keeper in the sul­tan’s palace.</p>
    <p>With the help of trans­la­tors, Ms Widya, whose knowl­edge of Ba­hasa In­done­sia is lim­ited to a few nurs­ery rhymes her mother sang to her, learnt that the woman’s fam­ily had joined a govern­ment trans­mi­gra­tion scheme that took them to Lam­pung, 900km away on the south­ern tip of Su­ma­tra.</p>
    <p>Madam Suy­atni said her late hus­band was vi­o­lent, and ran into trou­ble with neigh­bours and po­lice. A mob later set fire to their house.</p>
    <p>That was when Madam Suy­atni fled with her young daugh­ter to Jakarta to find work.</p>
    <p>“It was kinda scary (to find) some­one who can con­tinue the story which you have had in you for all those years,” said Ms Widya.</p>
    <p>More than 3,000 In­done­sian chil­dren were adopted by Dutch na­tion­als dur­ing the decade un­til 1984 when In­done­sia, which de­clared i nde­pen­dence from the Nether­lands i n 1945, all but banned the prac­tice.</p>
    <p>Ms Ana Maria van Valen, who her­self is an adoptee from In­done­sia, said a big chunk of over­seas adop­tions dur­ing that pe­riod were likely in­vol­un­tary.</p>
    <p>The 44-year-old, who re­mains close to her adop­tive par­ents, speaks from ex­pe­ri­ence. Her bi­o­log­i­cal mother was poor and had sought help from an or­phan­age to care for her tem­po­rar­ily.</p>
    <p>But the or­phan­age turned around and gave her up for adop­tion by Dutch par­ents.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple, whose con­di­tions could not be more dif­fer­ent from Ms Van Valen’s bi­o­log­i­cal par­ents, were keen to round out their fam­ily. They flew to In­done­sia, book­ing ex­cur­sions to tourist hot spots in­clud­ing Borobudur, to await com­ple­tion of the adop­tion process.</p>
    <p>“My Dutch par­ents al­ready had three boys and they wanted a girl but not a baby,” Ms Van Valen re­calls. “I was a girl and al­ready two and a half.”</p>
    <p>Ms Van Valen co-founded Mijn Roots – pro­nounced mine roots – in 2015 to help re­unite Dutch adoptees with their In­done­sian par­ents. Progress has been slow.</p>
    <p>Adop­tion doc­u­ments were rid­dled with er­rors and false­hoods. Of the hun­dreds of in­quiries her or­gan­i­sa­tion has re­ceived, 40 have yielded re­uni­fi­ca­tions. In roughly half of the cases, the non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion (NGO) would go on to learn from the bi­o­log­i­cal par­ents that the adop­tions had been in­vol­un­tary.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia was not the only source of over­seas adop­tions by Dutch cou­ples. Lo­cal me­dia reck­ons 40,000 over­seas adop­tions by Dutch na­tion­als from de­vel­op­ing coun­tries in­clud­ing Brazil and Sri Lanka over three decades to the late 1990s may be il­le­gal.</p>
    <p>In Ms Widya’s case, re­union and re­newal await. Re­sults of a DNA test con­firm­ing whether she is Madam Suy­atni’s daugh­ter are ex­pected by the end of the month. She has al­ready booked a flight to Jakarta to meet Madam Suy­atni early next month.</p>
    <p>On a re­cent af­ter­noon, Madam Suy­atni, who uses one name like many In­done­sians, dabs her eyes with her bur­gundy hi­jab.</p>
    <p>Liv­ing 90 min­utes from Jakarta, she runs a small kiosk from the front of her house, part of a neat row of low-in­come hous­ing. She is re­mar­ried and has had five more chil­dren, in­clud­ing one from Ms Widya’s bi­o­log­i­cal fa­ther.</p>
    <p>On this day, she is joined by her two young daugh­ters, aged 11 and 16. “It was only meant to be tem­po­rary,” she said of her sep­a­ra­tion from Ms Widya that day on the train plat­form in 1979.</p>
    <p>“I hope she can for­give me.”</p>
    <p>NOT MEANT TO BE PER­MA­NENT</p>
    <p>It was only meant to be tem­po­rary. I hope she can for­give me.</p>
