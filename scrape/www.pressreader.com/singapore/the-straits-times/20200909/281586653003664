    <p>Sin­ga­pore goal­keeper Izwan Mah­bud is ex­cited to con­tinue his Thai­land ad­ven­ture af­ter sign­ing a one-year deal with top-tier side Sa­mut Prakan City last Satur­day. The coun­try’s League 1 sea­son will re­sume on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Af­ter three months of un­cer­tainty, Sin­ga­pore goal­keeper Izwan Mah­bud fi­nally has a rea­son to smile af­ter sign­ing a one-sea­son deal to con­tinue his ca­reer in Thai League 1 with Sa­mut Prakan City last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Nick­named Sea Fang, the club were for­merly known as Pat­taya United be­fore they moved to Sa­mut Prakan, a prov­ince about 25km from Bangkok, last year when they fin­ished sixth.</p>
    <p>The 30-year-old told The Straits Times: “I’m ex­cited, re­lieved, and grate­ful for this op­por­tu­nity, be­cause I thought this year was go­ing to be a write-off for me.”</p>
    <p>In May, when his fam­ily and friends were cel­e­brat­ing Hari Raya Aidil­fitri, he was barely in the mood to join in the fes­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>At the back of his mind, he was wor­ried about his fu­ture with Thai League 1 side Trat FC, who had ter­mi­nated fel­low Sin­ga­porean Afiq Yunos’ con­tract a month ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Izwan’s fears were con­firmed in June, when he was also re­leased by the club as the sea­son was sus­pended af­ter just four games ow­ing to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The league even­tu­ally de­cided to restart this Satur­day, but that was of lit­tle com­fort to the cus­to­dian, who was job­less.</p>
    <p>It did not help that even here, there was lit­tle de­mand for his ser­vices with ev­ery Sin­ga­pore Premier League club al­ready hav­ing at least two goal­keep­ers on their books.</p>
    <p>He said: “I was very down be­cause I was look­ing for­ward to play­ing and per­form­ing in T1. I was also very wor­ried be­cause it is very dif­fi­cult to find a job any­where with the pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Still, he stayed in con­di­tion af­ter re­turn­ing to Sin­ga­pore, train­ing with the Young Lions for a month af­ter small-group ses­sions were al­lowed in phase two of the post-cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>His work ethic did not go un­no­ticed.</p>
    <p>Sa­mut Prakan City were on the look­out for a for­eign goal­keeper to chal­lenge Pati­wat Kham­mai, and coach Masa­tada Ishii re­ceived pos­i­tive feed­back from Sin­ga­pore na­tional coach Tat­suma Yoshida.</p>
    <p>Yoshida said: “Izwan was look­ing for a new club and was still keen on play­ing overseas. I know their coach and be­lieve he can help fur­ther Izwan’s devel­op­ment as a player.</p>
    <p>“It is im­por­tant for him to keep play­ing foot­ball at a high level in or­der to main­tain his po­si­tion as a key player in the na­tional team.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter agree­ing terms with the club last Satur­day, Izwan is grate­ful he can re­sume his T1 jour­ney.</p>
    <p>He said: “I be­lieve I can still achieve greater heights in my overseas ca­reer, and I’m thank­ful that Sa­mut Prakan City have this trust in me, and also for coach Tat­suma’s role in this.</p>
    <p>“The club are run pro­fes­sion­ally, and have am­bi­tion to play in the AFC Cham­pi­ons League, so I feel we are a good fit and I’m look­ing for­ward to help­ing the team reach our tar­gets.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, with four goal­keep­ers in the squad, Izwan is un­der no il­lu­sion that he can just waltz into the first team, start­ing with their first game against Ray­ong at home on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>He said: “There is no such thing as a free pass in com­pet­i­tive foot­ball and I will work ex­tremely hard to jus­tify my place in the team.”</p>
