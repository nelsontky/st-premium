    <p>When Mr Joko Wi­dodo was re-elected as In­done­sia’s pres­i­dent last year, his dream was to trans­form the coun­try into one that would have an an­nual per capita in­come of 320 mil­lion ru­piah (S$29,500) and a gross do­mes­tic prod­uct of US$7 tril­lion (S$9.5 tril­lion) by 2045.</p>
    <p>He in­tro­duced then the con­cept of an “om­nibus law” – a sin­gle over­ar­ch­ing law aimed at tack­ling prob­lem­atic leg­is­la­tion known to hin­der for­eign in­vest­ment across sev­eral sec­tors. It was passed in Par­lia­ment on Mon­day, less than a year later. Con­sid­er­ing the te­dious­ness of hav­ing to re­vise over 70 ex­ist­ing laws and more than 1,200 clauses, it was a ma­jor feat.</p>
    <p>But street protests swiftly broke out across the coun­try and are on­go­ing. On the face of it, it would be hard to ar­gue against a law touted to be an an­ti­dote to many of In­done­sia’s in­vest­ment woes.</p>
    <p>At its very essence, this new piece of leg­is­la­tion will stream­line bu­reau­cracy, re­move over­lap­ping and of­ten con­tra­dic­tory reg­u­la­tions, and fire up a slug­gish econ­omy that is reel­ing from the dev­as­tat­ing im­pact of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>For­eign in­vestors have long be­moaned the low pro­duc­tiv­ity of the In­done­sian work­force. Among other things, sev­er­ance is­sues make it vir­tu­ally im­pos­si­ble to lay off per­ma­nent em­ploy­ees. As a re­sult, many com­pa­nies re­sisted new hires and used rolling con­tracts to out­source the work.</p>
    <p>But the om­nibus law, which is chiefly cen­tred around sim­pli­fy­ing wages, work hours and job re­dun­dancy, comes at a time when In­done­sians are suf­fer­ing eco­nomic hard­ships due to in­come cuts and job losses.</p>
    <p>“While it will be ben­e­fi­cial for busi­nesses and in­vestors, it will give fod­der to protests,” Mr Made Supri­atma, an ISEAS – Yu­sof Ishak In­sti­tute vis­it­ing fel­low, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“Look­ing at what is go­ing on in the streets of Jakarta and other ma­jor cities, I am afraid that it will spin out of con­trol. We are in the mid­dle of a pan­demic and peo­ple are an­grier than usual.”</p>
    <p>The law, which cov­ers, among other things, job cre­ation, tax­a­tion and in­vest­ment, drew a mixed re­sponse from the start. It is no sur­prise that any gov­ern­ment will face re­sis­tance in try­ing to make changes that will un­favourably af­fect a large part of the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Hence, a push­back was ex­pected. But this anger could have been min­imised had there been greater trans­parency, say le­gal ex­perts, labour unions and green groups.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic was not con­sulted and the new reg­u­la­tion also re­moved pro­tec­tion for the en­vi­ron­ment and work­ers, they told ST.</p>
    <p>Mr Tim­boel Sire­gar, sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the</p>
    <p>In­done­sian Work­ers Or­gan­i­sa­tion, said the new law will al­low firms to hire work­ers in­def­i­nitely through a con­trac­tual ar­range­ment, re­mov­ing the pre­vi­ously re­quired two-year min­i­mum en­gage­ment for new em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>He also took is­sue with set­ting the min­i­mum wage only for the pro­vin­cial level.</p>
    <p>“The cost of liv­ing in Jakarta is dif­fer­ent to the cost of liv­ing in a pro­vin­cial vil­lage. Com­pa­nies may ex­ploit the law and pay ev­ery­one the same, and that is un­fair,” he told ST.</p>
    <p>Mr Asep Ko­marudin, a Green­peace In­done­sia senior for­est cam­paigner, said the new law had scrapped a strict, but im­por­tant, li­a­bil­ity clause which pro­vides a le­gal ba­sis to sue cor­po­ra­tions for caus­ing en­vi­ron­men­tal dam­age.</p>
    <p>“Ad­min­is­tra­tive sanc­tions alone are weak and pro­vide no de­ter­rence. This will mean for­est fires and haze will con­tinue to hap­pen,” he told ST.</p>
    <p>Mr Made said Mr Joko needs to walk a fine line. While he has re­ceived ma­jor­ity sup­port in Par­lia­ment, the new law is highly un­pop­u­lar with the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>“How he re­acts to the protests, when they be­come big­ger and un­con­trol­lable, will de­ter­mine his strength and his over­all pres­i­dency,” he added.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has al­ready de­railed many of Mr Joko’s eco­nomic plans and in­fras­truc­ture projects. The om­nibus law could se­cure his last­ing legacy when he leaves of­fice in 2024. It could also undo it, if his haste to rush through his de­sired re­form causes a mas­sive pub­lic back­lash.</p>
