    <p>I had a sim­i­lar en­counter as that of Ms Mok Wei Chi re­cently in book­ing a bad­minton court through Ac­tiveSG (Free sports, health-re­lated events blighted by no-shows, Dec 23).</p>
    <p>I no­ticed there were a cou­ple of empty courts on the ac­tual day when the venue was sup­posed to be fully booked.</p>
    <p>It has al­ways been dif­fi­cult to book bad­minton courts, but the pan­demic this year has made it even harder.</p>
    <p>Book­ings open 14 days ahead at 7am on the Ac­tiveSG web­site, and the courts are usu­ally snapped up within min­utes. Be­cause slots are lim­ited, some peo­ple end up book­ing what­ever re­main­ing slots are avail­able when their de­sired time slot is taken up. This “book first, con­firm later” men­tal­ity could be the rea­son be­hind the no-shows at sports halls.</p>
    <p>The harder it is to book, the more peo­ple may re­sort to such be­hav­iour just to en­sure that they can se­cure a court. When they sub­se­quently re­alise that they or their bad­minton bud­dies are not able to make it for the booked tim­ing, they can­not can­cel be­cause booked slots can­not be re­leased and are non-re­fund­able.</p>
    <p>If Ac­tiveSG could re­vise its pol­icy to al­low can­cel­la­tions up to two days prior, this will at least al­low oth­ers to book the courts that would other­wise be wasted.</p>
    <p>Th­ese courts will per­pet­u­ally be fully booked due to high de­mand, but the courts will not be fully utilised un­less there is a change in the book­ing pro­to­cols.</p>
