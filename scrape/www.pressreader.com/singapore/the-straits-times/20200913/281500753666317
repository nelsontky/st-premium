    <p>Within three days of view­ing a 20th-storey flat at Natura Loft in Bis­han Street 24, Mr Wong Jing Yean placed a $1.07 mil­lion bid on April 7, the start of the two-month­long cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>It was the high­est among sev­eral for the 120 sq m, or nearly 1,300 sq ft, De­sign, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) unit, with a panoramic view of the city sky­line.</p>
    <p>The mil­lion dol­lar price tag was an “at­trac­tive price point” for the 32-year-old ac­tu­ary, who is mar­ried with two chil­dren, as the unit has double the space com­pared with his pre­vi­ous condo at Jewel@Buangkok. Plus, it still has 90 years left on the lease.</p>
    <p>House hunt­ing amid the pan­demic and height­ened social dis­tance re­quire­ments did have its chal­lenges. For in­stance, the num­ber of view­ings was re­duced some­what as mul­ti­ple par­ties were pro­hib­ited from view­ing the same unit at the same time, and many sell­ers also wanted to keep view­ings to a cer­tain time­frame, Mr Wong said.</p>
    <p>But a big­ger prob­lem was the cir­cuit breaker, which de­layed his flat’s re­sale com­ple­tion by about two months.</p>
    <p>“From ap­pli­ca­tion to com­ple­tion, the re­sale process typ­i­cally takes eight to 10 weeks. We sub­mit­ted the ap­pli­ca­tion on April 28, and HDB ac­knowl­edge­ment typ­i­cally takes one to two weeks, so we should have got it by early May. But be­cause of the CB (cir­cuit breaker), we re­ceived the ac­knowl­edge­ment only on June 14. As a result, the re­sale process was com­pleted only in early Au­gust,” he said.</p>
    <p>“That was our big­gest chal­lenge, be­cause we had been rent­ing a flat for a year, and the lease was due to ex­pire in Au­gust. We were sup­posed to get our keys in June, com­plete ren­o­va­tion in Au­gust, and then move in.</p>
    <p>“For­tu­nately, we were able to ex­tend our rental lease for two more months. But we have to fork out an­other $7,000 to $8,000 for rent, be­cause ren­o­va­tion works will be com­pleted only in late Oc­to­ber or early Novem­ber.”</p>
    <p>Still, Mr Wong and his wife Chee Suet Yee, 32, a doc­tor at Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal, were happy to have found their dream home af­ter view­ing up to 20 five-room flats and maisonette­s of sizes vary­ing be­tween 1,300 sq ft and 1,700 sq ft.</p>
    <p>“We have started a fam­ily, so we need a big unit. But most of the ones we saw were in older es­tates, and over 20 to 30 years old. Then we found this unit, which gave me a good vibe as soon as I walked in. It also has a bal­cony, which is very rare for an HDB flat. Our plan is to have a din­ing ta­ble on the bal­cony, which will free up space in the liv­ing room for the kids to run around,” said Mr Wong, whose chil­dren are younger than three years old.</p>
    <p>An­other key con­sid­er­a­tion was that the DBSS project’s prices have held their own, he noted.</p>
    <p>Natura Loft, which houses a to­tal of 480 units in three res­i­den­tial blocks, first made head­lines when its five-room flats crossed the one­mil­lion-dol­lar mark in 2016, af­ter the five-year min­i­mum oc­cu­pa­tion pe­riod ended.</p>
    <p>DBSS flats are non-stan­dard fancier Hous­ing Board flats de­signed, built and sold by pri­vate de­vel­op­ers. “We looked at the his­tor­i­cal prices for our block. $1 mil­lion was the mar­ket price. We also did a bank val­u­a­tion of the unit, and it was above $1 mil­lion, so we are not sig­nif­i­cantly over­pay­ing,” Mr Wong said.</p>
    <p>“If you look at the over­all mar­ket, the $1.07 mil­lion we paid for our flat would have got us only a 500 sq ft to 600 sq ft condo in Bis­han.”</p>
