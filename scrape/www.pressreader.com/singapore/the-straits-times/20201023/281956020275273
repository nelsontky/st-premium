    <p>With all the fo­cus on Covid-19 safe man­age­ment mea­sures as com­pa­nies re­sume op­er­a­tions, firms must not for­get the fun­da­men­tals of work­place safety, said Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Man­power Zaqy Mohamad yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ten work­place deaths have been recorded since June 2, he said, with the lat­est four tak­ing place last month and this. The four cases oc­curred in high-risk op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of deaths is not higher than usual, but Mr Zaqy said there is con­cern that work­ers may be less fa­mil­iar with safety mea­sures after a pe­riod of in­ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies may feel an ur­gency to make up for lost time, but he urged em­ploy­ers to relook safety poli­cies, give work­ers time to ad­just, and con­duct re­fresher train­ing if needed.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s im­por­tant to put back mea­sures that we used to have, and en­sure that as we restart, while there’s some­times cer­tain pres­sures to get back on track and to catch up on lost time, this is not at the ex­pense of work­ers’ safety and health,” he said.</p>
    <p>“So this is one area where MOM (Min­istry of Man­power) will be step­ping up to put in place more en­force­ment mea­sures, more sur­veil­lance on the ground.”</p>
    <p>There were 16 work­place deaths in the first six months of this year.</p>
    <p>Last year, there were 17 in the first half and 22 in the sec­ond half.</p>
    <p>The lat­est four deaths took place in dif­fer­ent sec­tors, in­clud­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing and constructi­on, and</p>
    <p>the causes were also dif­fer­ent, said Mr Zaqy.</p>
    <p>A 27-year-old In­dian na­tional died last week after he was elec­tro­cuted while dis­man­tling an elec­tri­cal dis­tri­bu­tion board at 170 Still Road.</p>
    <p>Mr Zaqy said that be­sides vis­it­ing work­places, MOM will also be send­ing out ad­vi­sories and alerts to all em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>“When work­ers have been out for some time, man­agers and site su­per­vi­sors need to re­ally sit down, re­work the process, and take stock of the more risky work to be done and how that ap­plies un­der the new safe mea­sures,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Zaqy was speak­ing after a visit to a constructi­on work­site at the Chi­nese Gar­den, which is be­ing spruced up along with the Ja­panese Gar­den.</p>
    <p>The project, man­aged by Kuan Aik Hong Constructi­on, started last Novem­ber, but work was mostly halted dur­ing the two-month cir­cuit breaker – from April to June – to stem the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>To en­sure the safety of its work­ers, Kuan Aik Hong has im­ple</p>
    <p>mented mea­sures such as hav­ing each worker wear a safe dis­tanc­ing de­vice that beeps when two de­vices come within a pre­set dis­tance of each other, such as 1m.</p>
    <p>The firm’s 220 work­ers on site are also seg­re­gated into three zones. Work­ers from dif­fer­ent zones are not al­lowed to in­ter­act and have to stay in dif­fer­ent dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>In terms of constructi­on work safety, a hy­draulic static ring pile breaker is used in­stead of a pneu­matic drill – the for­mer is safer for work­ers and also re­duces their ex­po­sure to noise and dust pol­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Fabian Loi, gen­eral man­ager of Kuan Aik Hong Constructi­on, said that while there is al­ways pres­sure to catch up with work sched­ules, safety comes first.</p>
    <p>The firm’s num­ber of on-site su­per­vi­sors has been in­creased, he added. “They not only do su­per­vi­sion to im­prove safety, but also pro­vide a lis­ten­ing ear to work­ers... We think men­tal health well-be­ing is as im­por­tant as phys­i­cal safety.”</p>
    <p>PUT SAFETY FIRST</p>
    <p>I think it’s im­por­tant to put back mea­sures that we used to have, and en­sure that as we restart, while there’s some­times cer­tain pres­sures to get back on track and to catch up on lost time, this is not at the ex­pense of work­ers’ safety and health.’’</p>
