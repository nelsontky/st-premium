    <p>In late March, Ms Mar­garet Lim (not her real name) was pray­ing as usual in the bed­room when her 58-year-old hus­band left the flat and later took his own life.</p>
    <p>It was a day be­fore his birth­day, and she was go­ing to dis­cuss his birth­day plans with him.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily bread­win­ner had quit his job in the trans­port sec­tor less than two weeks ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim, who is in her 50s, said the shift work had af­fected his health.</p>
    <p>He had to ad­just to his new boss’ work­ing style since late last year and wanted to trans­fer to a low­er­ranked post for less pay, but it was not pos­si­ble .</p>
    <p>And then the pan­demic came. “He didn’t share or talk much, but I could see that he was quite af­fected by Covid-19 be­cause ev­ery day, there was al­ways bad news on TV,” said Ms Lim.</p>
    <p>She said he might have felt hope­less about the fu­ture after his res­ig­na­tion, given that the pan­demic was likely to be pro­longed and would af­fect his chances of find­ing work.</p>
    <p>“He prob­a­bly fore­saw that peo­ple would be los­ing their jobs, and he wouldn’t be able to find a tem­po­rary job,” she said.</p>
    <p>At home, her hus­band, who had de­pres­sion for a few years and was be­ing treated for it, also had to deal with his mother, who has de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>The 85-year-old could not un­der­stand why her daily out­ings were stopped in March be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“When she wanted to go out and couldn’t, she would bang and bang on the door and shout. It was very drain­ing emo­tion­ally. He felt very stressed,” Ms Lim said.</p>
    <p>“I think the trig­ger came when his mum fell in March. The hospi­tal had to re­strain her be­cause she was restless... He prob­a­bly felt very sad that he couldn’t help her.”</p>
    <p>After his death, Ms Lim ap­plied for fi­nan­cial aid to help the fam­ily get by as her work as a free­lance trainer is not sta­ble.</p>
    <p>All these years, she had fo­cused on car­ing for her in-laws while her hus­band brought home the ba­con. That was not the end of her woes. Car­ing for her 97-year-old fa­therin-law has be­come more chal­leng­ing now that he has started to hal­lu­ci­nate a lot, she said.</p>
    <p>He might sleep a lot dur­ing the day, but not much at night, and con­stantly asks for help.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim said she can­not af­ford to send him to a nurs­ing home.</p>
    <p>She also has yet to tell him about the death of his son.</p>
    <p>Her two chil­dren are in uni­ver­sity. Her daugh­ter at­tends classes on­line now, while her elder son is about to grad­u­ate from a de­gree pro­gramme over­seas, hav­ing taken a no-bond schol­ar­ship.</p>
    <p>Iron­i­cally, the cov­eted free­dom of such a schol­ar­ship is work­ing against him in this pan­demic as he is un­sure of be­ing able to land a full­time job in the next year or so.</p>
    <p>He came back for Chi­nese New Year but did not re­turn to school due to his fa­ther’s death and the Covid-19 travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>He is still pay­ing rent for his over­seas stu­dent ac­com­mo­da­tion, where his be­long­ings are kept.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim’s do­mes­tic helper, like many oth­ers here, had to can­cel her home leave be­cause of Covid-19, but has asked when she can go back to see her three chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim, who cried more than once dur­ing the interview, is stay­ing strong for her fam­ily, but finds that her back­ache, an old prob­lem, has wors­ened this year.</p>
    <p>Still, she is thank­ful that her mother-in-law was re­ferred to a nurs­ing home and has been cared for there.</p>
    <p>“The past few months have been so hard with my hus­band hav­ing left us. If she is at home, she will be ask­ing for him, and even if I tell her, she can­not re­mem­ber.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery day, she will ask for him and wait for him to take her out.”</p>
    <p>Ms Lim’s case high­lights the height­ened psy­cho­log­i­cal stress that some peo­ple are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing dur­ing this pan­demic, which has also seen more re­ports of fam­ily vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, Ms Va­hani (not her real name), 29, said her hus­band’s phys­i­cal abuse wors­ened amid the Covid-19 out­break. They are both Malaysians work­ing here.</p>
    <p>Ms Va­hani, who is in the ser­vice line, said the abuse started in 2017, the year be­fore they got mar­ried.</p>
    <p>Over the years, her 34-year-old hus­band has punched her near the eye, pulled her hair, hit her head and kicked her on var­i­ous oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>Each time, how­ever, she would for­give him and hope that things would get bet­ter one day. She said the pan­demic just made it worse.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary, as fears about the coro­n­avirus out­break were mount­ing, she found her­self fret­ting one night when her se­cu­rity of­fi­cer hus­band did not re­turn home.</p>
    <p>This had not hap­pened be­fore. When he ap­peared the next day at the flat where they rented a room, he was with a friend, and they were both drunk.</p>
    <p>After an ex­change of words, her hus­band be­came an­gry, heaped vul­gar­i­ties on her and hit her in front of his friend.</p>
    <p>It drove her to file her first po­lice re­port here against him.</p>
    <p>“I (would) think, ‘Am I a dog or a hu­man? Why does he hit me like this?’ ” said Ms Va­hani.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, he beat her up again. The po­lice were alerted, and she was sent to hospi­tal for a check-up. The pan­demic has meant that she and her hus­band can­not</p>
    <p>The past few months have been so hard with my hus­band hav­ing left us. If she is at home, she will be ask­ing for him, and even if I tell her, she can­not re­mem­ber. Ev­ery day, she will ask for him and wait for him to take her out.</p>
    <p>MS MAR­GARET LIM (not her real name), on her mother-in-law, who has de­men­tia. Her hus­band com­mit­ted sui­cide in late March.</p>
    <p>re­turn to their home towns to visit their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>Ms Va­hani said her hus­band has been par­tic­u­larly frus­trated that he could not re­turn to lend sup­port to his fam­ily, as his sib­ling had run afoul of the law a few months ago.</p>
    <p>Ms Eleanor Lee, a med­i­cal so­cial worker at Alexan­dra Hospi­tal who han­dled Ms Lim’s and Ms Va­hani’s cases, said she has al­ready re­ferred a few pa­tients who have been as­saulted at home to com­mu­nity part­ners for help this year.</p>
    <p>In pre­vi­ous years, such cases were few and far be­tween.</p>
    <p>She added that the pan­demic has not only wors­ened the men­tal health of some peo­ple, but also caused in­creased stress in some peo­ple who do not have ex­ist­ing men­tal health is­sues.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor John Wong, cen­tre di­rec­tor of the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity Health Sys­tem’s Mind Sci­ence Cen­tre, said he and his col­leagues have come across cases where peo­ple are suf­fer­ing from more stress in this pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Those with pre-ex­ist­ing men­tal health is­sues, some youth and the el­derly are among those vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>He shared that an el­derly wo­man with past men­tal health is­sues had pre­vi­ously been keep­ing her­self well by swim­ming five days a week.</p>
    <p>That had to stop dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, and she did not ex­er­cise at home.</p>
    <p>“She then be­came anx­ious and wor­ried that some­thing bad would hap­pen,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Over a pe­riod of three months, she be­came to­tally de­pen­dent on her fam­ily and helper.”</p>
    <p>Prof Wong said that some youth who did not have pre­vi­ous men­tal health chal­lenges may also feel the pres­sure of stay­ing at home a lot, due to in­tense parental su­per­vi­sion and their home en­vi­ron­ments, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>His team has seen re­cent cases where some youth made sui­cide at­tempts or in­flicted se­ri­ous self­harm.</p>
    <p>Some par­ents are not aware of the need to change their par­ent­ing ways, and con­tinue to treat their teenagers as young chil­dren, he said.</p>
    <p>In some of these cases, “the peo­ple to look out for is not the child, but the par­ent”, he said.</p>
