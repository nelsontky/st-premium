    <p>Bene­dic­tions in 2020 have been rare but two large trad­ing deals surely count. The glow in the East comes from the Novem­ber-born Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP) that yokes the 10-mem­ber Asean group­ing with five im­por­tant trad­ing part­ners in­clud­ing heavy­weight China. The hope in the West arises from the Christ­mas-eve deal be­tween the United King­dom and the Euro­pean Union that sets out how they will en­gage from Jan 1, when Bri­tain’s de­cou­pling from the con­ti­nent is com­plete. The stark dif­fer­ence be­tween the two deals is what makes this an es­pe­cially ed­uca­tive mo­ment. The RCEP is ori­ented to­wards dis­man­tling trade bar­ri­ers, while the Euro­pean deal springs up fences where there were none for the last 47 years.</p>
    <p>The sep­a­ra­tion will go down eas­ier, thanks to the last-minute agree­ment that will let the UK and the EU con­tinue to trade in goods on zero-tar­iff, zero-quota ba­sis. Trade in ser­vices, though, is the weak link, and a mat­ter of worry for Lon­don’s fu­ture as a fi­nan­cial cen­tre. But Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son has wrested the reins on other fronts, in­clud­ing the right to set Bri­tain’s own labour, en­vi­ron­ment and other reg­u­la­tions. The EU re­tains the abil­ity to ap­ply tar­iffs if it be­lieves the UK has dis­torted the play­ing field with gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies, for in­stance. Even fish­ing, the big bone of con­tention, has been set­tled for at least five years, af­ter which hag­gling can re­sume.</p>
    <p>None of this eclipses the fact that the deal is more a con­so­la­tion prize than a vic­tory for ei­ther side – although it is a vastly prefer­able out­come to the UK leap­ing out of the EU with no safety nets, and is a bet­ter ar­range­ment over­all than any free trade agree­ment (FTA) that Europe has with the rest of the world. The re­al­ity is that the UK has ex­ited the sin­gle Euro­pean mar­ket and cus­toms union, and de­lays and red tape are now in­evitable. The con­se­quences will soon be vis­i­ble to busi­nesses and tourists as checks and cus­toms dec­la­ra­tions slow things at the bor­ders. This marks a low point in glob­al­i­sa­tion, the mo­ment when pop­ulism, pro­tec­tion­ism and nar­rowly de­fined na­tion­al­ism pre­vailed over a log­i­cal evo­lu­tion into the next-level trad­ing regime. It il­lus­trates as vividly the fail­ure of lead­er­ship, and the folly of let­ting dis­con­tent­ment sim­mer un­til it cracks na­tional co­he­sion. The trau­matic cir­cum­stances of birth of the new deal in a pan­demic-rid­den world can­not be ig­nored. In­deed, the sense of cri­sis ought to im­part ur­gency to the push for new deals. A good be­gin­ning was in Asia with the UK-Sin­ga­pore FTA signed this month. It as­sures com­pa­nies here and in the UK of ben­e­fits they have been re­ceiv­ing un­der the FTA with the EU. It is a vote of con­fi­dence that max­imis­ing na­tional aims is pos­si­ble while sub­scrib­ing to larger ideals. Cut­ting the ties that bind is for the best only when bet­ter re­la­tion­ships are forged.</p>
