    <p>As Sin­ga­pore­ans across the is­land rang in the na­tion’s 55th birth­day yes­ter­day, a cou­ple wel­comed a new baby into their lives.</p>
    <p>This year’s first Na­tional Day baby, Matilda Tan, was born to Mrs Natalie Tan, 25, and Mr Jonathan Tan, 27, as the clock struck 12 at KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hospi­tal. She weighed in at 3.6 kg.</p>
    <p>The first-time par­ents, who both work as soft­ware de­vel­op­ers, told The Straits Times that the baby was due on Aug 13.</p>
    <p>But at about 5am on Satur­day, Mrs Tan lost her mu­cus plug, an in­di­ca­tion that labour could be­gin soon. The cou­ple no­ti­fied the hospi­tal and were ad­vised to go down to pre­pare for de­liv­ery. Mrs Tan went into labour at about 8pm.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said they de­cided on the name Matilda as they wanted one that sig­ni­fied over­com­ing ad­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>“It means ‘strong bat­tle’ in Ger­man. It’s also the name of a char­ac­ter in the Roald Dahl book and we re­ally like the mean­ing of that. And it feels like, be­cause she de­cided to come out on Na­tional Day, the name fits her – she’s re­ally strong-willed,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that they did not ex­pect to re­ceive her at the stroke of mid­night, but now, “we will re­mem­ber for life the story of her birth”.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple said they would take the day to rest, and try to tune in to live-streams of the cel­e­bra­tions.</p>
    <p>Mrs Tan said she is glad the baby is healthy, adding: “It’s a nice co­in­ci­dence (to be born on Na­tional Day) for her but to me it doesn’t re­ally mat­ter what day this is, as long as she grows up strong and healthy.”</p>
    <p>Shar­ing his good wishes for the na­tion, Mr Tan said: “I hope ev­ery­one stays safe and healthy. I think this Na­tional Day re­ally shows the SG</p>
    <p>United spirit. We are all try­ing to over­come this ad­ver­sity that hasn’t been seen be­fore.”</p>
    <p>Among other Na­tional Day ba­bies yes­ter­day was a boy born at 12.58am to re­search as­sis­tant Azri Razali, 32, and re­search co­or­di­na­tor Lyana Shaffiee, 28, at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hospi­tal (NUH). He weighed 2.1 kg.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple named their son, who is their first child, Ai­man, which they said means “right­eous, blessed and fearless”.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily was pre­sented with a hand-painted card and ham­per con­tain­ing diapers, made by the nurses in their ward, 9A.</p>
    <p>The next nine ba­bies born at NUH also re­ceived sim­i­lar gifts.</p>
    <p>Said Madam Lyana: “We are cel­e­brat­ing with our first­born and we wish all Sin­ga­pore­ans a happy Na­tional Day.”</p>
