    <p>A Sin­ga­porean man now faces 11 charges in re­la­tion to scan­dal-hit Ger­man dig­i­tal pay­ments com­pany Wire­card, af­ter an ad­di­tional five were im­posed.</p>
    <p>The new charges were lodged against R. Shan­mu­garat­nam, a di­rec­tor of Ci­tadelle Cor­po­rate Ser­vices, on Wed­nes­day for al­legedly fak­ing five more let­ters in early 2017 stat­ing bo­gus bal­ances held in his com­pany’s ac­counts.</p>
    <p>Ci­tadelle is one of two com­pa­nies the Sin­ga­pore au­thor­i­ties are in­ves­ti­gat­ing.</p>
    <p>The lat­est charges come as the Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) or­dered Wire­card en­ti­ties in Sin­ga­pore to stop their pay­ment ser­vices here.</p>
    <p>The charge sheets ac­cuse Shan­mu­garat­nam of fal­si­fy­ing two let­ters from Ci­tadelle to Wire­card UK & Ire­land.</p>
    <p>One stated in Fe­bru­ary 2017 that Ci­tadelle held in an es­crow ac­count a bal­ance of €97.5 mil­lion (S$156 mil­lion) as at Nov 30, 2016. The sec­ond claimed in March 2017 that there was a bal­ance of about €177.5 mil­lion in the same ac­count as at Dec 31, 2016.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the ac­count did not hold such bal­ances, the charge sheets stated.</p>
    <p>In March 2017, Shan­mu­garat­nam also al­legedly faked three let­ters from Ci­tadelle – one to Wire­card AG and two to Cardsys­tems Mid­dle East – stat­ing that his com­pany held amounts rang­ing from €30 mil­lion to nearly €86.4 mil­lion as at Dec 31, 2016, in three es­crow ac­counts. But Ci­tadelle did not ac­tu­ally main­tain those three ac­counts, ac­cord­ing to Wed­nes­day’s charge sheets.</p>
    <p>These of­fences are all pun­ish­able un­der Sec­tion 477A of the Pe­nal Code.</p>
    <p>A few months ago, Shan­mu­garat­nam, 54, was first ac­cused of fal­si­fy­ing four let­ters that mis­rep­re­sented his com­pany’s bal­ances in ac­counts. He faced two more sim­i­lar charges in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Ci­tadelle has re­port­edly han­dled money for Wire­card in a trustee ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it is not li­censed to pro­vide such ser­vices in Sin­ga­pore and is not su­per­vised by MAS.</p>
    <p>The reg­u­la­tor has placed Ci­tadelle on the In­vestor Alert List on its web­site.</p>
