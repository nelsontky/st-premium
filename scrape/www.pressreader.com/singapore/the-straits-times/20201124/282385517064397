    <p>Manch­ester United may need six points from their three re­main­ing Cham­pi­ons League group-stage games to qual­ify for the next phase of the com­pe­ti­tion af­ter a shock de­feat by Is­tan­bul Basak­se­hir this month, man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>United won their open­ing two games against Paris Saint-Ger­main and RB Leipzig be­fore los­ing 2-1 to the Turk­ish cham­pi­ons and Sol­sk­jaer be­lieves to­day’s re­turn fix­ture at Old Traf­ford not only of­fers them the chance to re­spond but to con­sol­i­date their po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>They lead Group H with six points but could po­ten­tially drop out of the top two if they lose again.</p>
    <p>“We started well with two wins but we were dis­ap­pointed with the last game against Is­tan­bul. We need 10 points to go through but you may need 12 points,” Sol­sk­jaer told re­porters at his vir­tual pre­match press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“We’re go­ing to go into this game to try and win it and to win it well with a good per­for­mance be­cause we have games com­ing thick and fast. That de­feat was a big blow.</p>
    <p>“You know it’ll be dif­fi­cult. Noth­ing un­ex­pected, but our level of con­cen­tra­tion needs to be bet­ter.</p>
    <p>“The goals we con­ceded, we caused our prob­lems with or­gan­i­sa­tion. We need to be more pa­tient, dis­ci­plined in our po­si­tion­ing.”</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer added that he was hope­ful French World Cup-win­ning mid­fielder Paul Pogba can feature af­ter miss­ing their 1-0 Premier League win over West Bromwich Al­bion on Saturday.</p>
    <p>“He trained this morn­ing, so we’ll see if there’s any re­ac­tion when we re­port to­mor­row,” the Nor­we­gian said.</p>
    <p>“Luke Shaw is out (for four weeks), Phil Jones is out and Jesse Lin­gard is still self-iso­lat­ing af­ter be­ing in con­tact with a pos­i­tive case. There are one or two things we need to look at.”</p>
    <p>Backup goal­keeper Dean Hen­der­son is re­port­edly seek­ing a loan move when the Jan­uary trans­fer win­dow opens. Bri­tish me­dia have said the United No. 2 is wor­ried he may lose his place in Eng­land’s Euro 2020 squad due to a lack of play­ing time.</p>
    <p>He has yet to start for the club in the Premier League this sea­son af­ter play­ing the en­tire cam­paign on loan at Sh­effield United last term.</p>
    <p>Hen­der­son, who made his Cham­pi­ons League de­but in Is­tan­bul, is ex­pected to make his sec­ond Euro­pean ap­pear­ance to­day, and Sol­sk­jaer re­futed ru­mours of a move.</p>
    <p>“Dean wants to stay and play for United. I can’t see the logic in only one more ap­pear­ance be­fore Christ­mas,” he added. “Do you know how many games we have? He is train­ing well, he has po­ten­tial to be one of the best. I don’t buy the ar­gu­ment it is make or break from him (to­mor­row).”</p>
