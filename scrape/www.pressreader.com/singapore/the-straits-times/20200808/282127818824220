    <p>In need of cash, ac­tor-singer Mo­hamad Aliff Aziz opened an In­done­sian ac­tress’ hand­bag in her ho­tel room, while she was rest­ing, to steal $300 and one mil­lion ru­piah (S$94) in cash from her.</p>
    <p>The 29-year-old Sin­ga­porean pleaded guilty yes­ter­day to one count each of theft and be­hav­ing in a dis­or­derly man­ner in pub­lic. A sec­ond theft charge will be con­sid­ered dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>This was not his first brush with the law. In 2014, he was fined $2,000 for steal­ing two mo­bile phones.</p>
    <p>In the cur­rent case, Aliff had met Ms Raja Yu­nika Perd­hana Putri, 32, in her room at the Stu­dio M ho­tel in Nan­son Road near Have­lock Road at around mid­night on June 7 last year to dis­cuss how she could help fur­ther his singing ca­reer in In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>At around 1am, Ms Raja Yu­nika went to the sec­ond storey of her room to rest, leav­ing her hand­bag near Aliff. He opened it, took the money and left the room.</p>
    <p>She woke up about two hours later and phoned Aliff af­ter notic­ing that her money was miss­ing.</p>
    <p>He de­nied steal­ing the cash and she lodged a po­lice re­port later that day.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Sarah Siaw said Aliff later ad­mit­ted that he had stolen the cash as “he was in need of money”. He then used the cash for food and trans­porta­tion. He has since made full resti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>In an un­re­lated case, Aliff was found to be in­tox­i­cated un­der the link bridge of Or­chard Tow­ers shop­ping cen­tre at around 5.30am on Nov 10 last year.</p>
    <p>A po­lice of­fi­cer who was in the vicin­ity saw him shout­ing loudly and ges­tic­u­lat­ing at some­one.</p>
    <p>Sergeant Theodore Lee, 24, told Aliff to calm down and he com­plied be­fore walk­ing away, only to com­mit sim­i­lar acts again about an hour later.</p>
    <p>This time, Aliff also walked to­wards a nearby taxi and kicked its bumper. No dam­age was caused. He was then ar­rested af­ter he got into a scuf­fle with an ac­quain­tance, the court heard.</p>
    <p>Aliff rose to fame in 2007 af­ter win­ning Malay chan­nel Suria’s ver­sion of Sin­ga­pore Idol, called Anugerah.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, de­fence lawyer Mu­rali Pil­lai urged the court to call for a re­port to as­sess Aliff’s suit­abil­ity for a manda­tory treat­ment or­der. Of­fend­ers given it have to un­dergo treat­ment to ad­dress their men­tal con­di­tions in lieu of jail time.</p>
    <p>Mr Pil­lai did not re­veal de­tails about his client’s con­di­tion and Prin­ci­pal District Judge Vic­tor Yeo then called for the re­port.</p>
    <p>Aliff is now out on bail of $10,000 and will be sen­tenced on Sept 14.</p>
