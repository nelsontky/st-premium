    <p>An air­craft hanger at Changi Air Base us­ing so­lar pan­els, and retrofitti­ng work at One Raf­fles Link that will save the equiv­a­lent of $120,000 a year in power costs, were among those given a cov­eted award by the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Author­ity (BCA).</p>
    <p>The BCA Green Mark was con­ferred on 376 projects, in­clud­ing 16 over­seas, this year, the author­ity said yes­ter­day. Green Mark cer­ti­fi­ca­tions were launched in 2005 to eval­u­ate a build­ing’s en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact and per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>The air­craft hangar and One Raf­fles Link were among 22 of the 376 projects that at­tained the top Green Mark that des­ig­nates a su­per-low en­ergy build­ing. Only 39 projects in­volv­ing 50 in­dus­try play­ers have re­ceived this cov­eted award.</p>
    <p>The BCA said: “The trend of build­ing own­ers go­ing for higher tier Green Mark cer­ti­fi­ca­tions (Green Mark Plat­inum and above) is in­dica­tive of the in­dus­try’s aware­ness of the pos­i­tive im­pact of green build­ings and recog­nis­ing them as key in our ef­forts to fight cli­mate change.”</p>
    <p>The num­ber of non-res­i­den­tial build­ing projects ob­tain­ing higher tier Green Mark cer­ti­fi­ca­tion dou­bled to 149 over the past five years, it noted. “Ma­jor Sin­ga­pore de­vel­op­ers, such as Cap­i­taLand, City De­vel­op­ments and Kep­pel Land, have also been set­ting tar­gets for re­duc­ing en­ergy use and car­bon foot­print in their build­ing port­fo­lios,” the BCA added.</p>
    <p>Cap­i­taLand won this year’s Green Mark Plat­inum Cham­pion Award, which recog­nises de­vel­op­ers that demon­strate strong com­mit­ment to­wards cor­po­rate so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity and have achieved a sub­stan­tial num­ber of Green Mark Gold build­ings or higher.</p>
    <p>The de­vel­oper in­stalled 21,000 so­lar pan­els atop lo­gis­tics build­ing Lo­gisTech and five other in­dus­trial prop­er­ties here. This will en­able its cor­po­rate of­fices in three lo­ca­tions to be to­tally pow­ered by re­new­able en­ergy by the end of the year. This will help the firm re­duce over 700 tonnes of green­house gas emis­sions each year, equiv­a­lent to emis­sions gen­er­ated an­nu­ally from 400 four-room Hous­ing Board flats.</p>
    <p>Cap­i­taLand group chief sus­tain­abil­ity of­fi­cer Lynette Leong said: “We are heart­ened by BCA’s recog­ni­tion. Over the past decade, Cap­i­taLand’s ef­forts in sus­tain­abil­ity have reaped tan­gi­ble ben­e­fits.”</p>
    <p>Cap­i­taLand has se­cured $1.2 bil­lion in green loans that will be used to ac­cel­er­ate its ef­forts to­wards green­ing its port­fo­lio by 2030.</p>
    <p>The BCA also col­lab­o­rated with the Health Pro­mo­tion Board to de­velop a Green Mark for Health­ier Work­places two years ago.</p>
    <p>Co-work­ing fa­cil­ity provider Space Lab One won the award this year for a project with de­signs sup­port­ing men­tal well-be­ing and en­ergy-ef­fi­cient light­ing, as well as pro­grammes that help em­ploy­ees in ar­eas such as healthy eat­ing, and chronic dis­ease man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>BCA chief ex­ec­u­tive Hugh Lim said: “Aside from en­vi­ron­men­tal per­for­mance through­out the build­ing life cy­cle, the Green Mark scheme also takes into con­sid­er­a­tion build­ing oc­cu­pants’ health and well-be­ing – an im­me­di­ate con­cern now with the pan­demic.”</p>
