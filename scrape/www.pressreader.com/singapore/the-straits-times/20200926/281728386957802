    <p>When Aman Gwjwn, 17, de­vel­oped a per­sis­tent cough and cold in July, on holiday at her grand­mother’s home in Ban­ga­lore, her fam­ily of eight went to war, pre­par­ing them­selves for Covid-19 to sweep through their home.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one from a 14-year-old eighth grader to a near-oc­to­ge­nar­ian would go on to be in­fected. But the Chi­nese-In­dian fam­ily slowly won their bat­tle against the dis­ease over the next 11/ months, armed</p>
    <p>2 with dis­ci­pline, com­po­sure and lo­gis­ti­cal plan­ning.</p>
    <p>“Our ap­proach was: We’ll all surely get it, but we’ll all sur­vive it as a fam­ily. We just made sure ev­ery­one didn’t fall sick to­gether, so that some peo­ple were healthy enough to take care of the oth­ers,” said Ms Jen­nifer Liang, 48, Aman’s mother and a so­cial worker in As­sam who flew to Ban­ga­lore im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>The Liangs formed what they called “a war coun­cil” of de­ci­sion­mak­ers, which in­cluded Ms Liang’s hus­band Su­nil Kaul, a doc­tor and pub­lic health ac­tivist in As­sam. As Aman iso­lated her­self in her un­cle’s house nearby, the fam­ily set up a What­sApp group called Covid Plan­ning.</p>
    <p>They iden­ti­fied rooms they could use for iso­la­tion in their two homes in the neigh­bour­hood. They gath­ered an as­sort­ment of ther­mome­ters, oxime­ters to check oxy­gen sat­u­ra­tion lev­els, hot wa­ter flasks, gar­gle so­lu­tions and sani­tiser sprays.</p>
    <p>It was agreed that the old­est mem­ber of the fam­ily, 78-year-old Mrs Liang Li Ying, was the most vul­ner­a­ble to the coro­n­avirus, and would need hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“In July, Ban­ga­lore had hor­ror sto­ries of peo­ple go­ing from hos­pi­tal to hos­pi­tal in search of beds. So we called some doc­tors be­fore­hand and checked on bed avail­abil­ity,” said Mrs Glo­ria Liang, 41, who runs</p>
    <p>PLAN­NING IS KEY</p>
    <p>a food prod­ucts busi­ness with her hus­band Peter, the elder Mrs Liang’s old­est child.</p>
    <p>Thir­teen days af­ter Aman showed symp­toms, Glo­ria de­vel­oped a sore throat and fever, and iso­lated her­self in an­other room. Glo­ria’s eighth-grade daugh­ter Josephine was next to fall ill with a fever, fol­lowed by her older col­lege-age daugh­ter Joan.</p>
    <p>When both girls lost their sense of smell, they iso­lated them­selves straight­away, not wait­ing for Covid-19 tests.</p>
    <p>“Test re­sults take time and some were in­con­clu­sive. To be on the safe side, we as­sumed ev­ery­one with even mild symp­toms has Covid, and fol­lowed our pro­to­col,” said their fa­ther Peter, 50.</p>
    <p>As more fam­ily mem­bers fell sick, they used spread­sheets to track when each per­son went into quar­an­tine and came out of it.</p>
    <p>A caterer de­liv­ered meals, while the fam­ily fo­cused on steam in­hala­tions, ex­er­cise and build­ing im­mu­nity. Every day, they would note down their tem­per­a­tures and record their vary­ing symp­toms.</p>
    <p>Dr Su­nil, co­or­di­nat­ing from As­sam, ad­vised against an­tibi­otics, so the fam­ily used Ti­betan tra­di­tional medicines for pains and fevers.</p>
    <p>They joked about how Peter would chase them with a bot­tle of rose essence to test their sense of smell. “We hated sniff­ing that sweet smell but if we couldn’t smell it, it meant we had Covid,” said Joan, 20, the un­der­grad­u­ate, who con­tin­ued at­tend­ing her on­line classes to stay ac­tive.</p>
    <p>With hugs banned, the fam­ily kept their spir­its up with board games and movies – all while wear­ing masks. They even used the com­mu­nal lock­down to learn how to play mahjong.</p>
    <p>Some­times plans un­rav­elled. To his sur­prise, Peter, who was in good health, felt breath­less late one night and had to be rushed to a hos­pi­tal. Soon af­ter, his mother, Mrs Liang, ex­pe­ri­enced chest pains, and was also ad­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>“I prayed for my fam­ily to re­cover</p>
    <p>fast, but I felt I would rather die than feel this pain,” said Mrs Liang, who felt over­whelm­ingly lonely in her hos­pi­tal room.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing spent much of her adult­hood in In­dia, the grand­mother of three un­der­stands Hindi and English, but in the hos­pi­tal, un­well and scared, she could re­call only Can­tonese. With her chil­dren not al­lowed in the Covid-19 wards, and no med­i­cal staff con­ver­sant in Can­tonese, Mrs Liang was mis­er­able.</p>
    <p>“When she stopped eat­ing, our doc­tor friend fi­nally con­nected us over the phone. My mother sobbed and said she was starv­ing but was un­able to swal­low,” said Jen­nifer.</p>
    <p>The doc­tors im­me­di­ately put the 78-year-old in in­ten­sive care, in­tu­bated her and started tube feed­ing.</p>
    <p>Jen­nifer and her younger brother Lawrence, 45, who came from Delhi, both fell ill, though the lat­ter tested neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>By the mid­dle of last month, all eight had re­cov­ered. “A friend sent us briyani. With our taste back, we re­ally en­joyed it,” said Joan.</p>
    <p>As they emerged from their ill­ness, the Liangs found many friends ask­ing for ad­vice. In a snappy 15-panel pre­sen­ta­tion, they of­fered prac­ti­cal ad­vice on how to ro­tate care­giv­ing re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, strate­gi­cally quar­an­tine, build im­mu­nity with ex­er­cise and diet, and keep morale high.</p>
    <p>Fam­i­lies with many gen­er­a­tions liv­ing to­gether are com­mon in In­dia, and the Liangs’ doc­u­ment be­came widely shared on so­cial me­dia. Jen­nifer heard that com­plete strangers were us­ing it to pre­pare their own re­sponses.</p>
    <p>“The dis­ease is un­pre­dictable, so plan­ning is key. The main thing is, don’t panic,” she said.</p>
