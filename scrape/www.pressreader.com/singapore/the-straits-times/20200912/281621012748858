    <p>Re­trenched Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) staff will re­ceive one month of pay for every year of ser­vice, capped at 25 months, The Straits Times has learnt.</p>
    <p>This is pro­vided they have been in ser­vice for two years or more.</p>
    <p>Each af­fected em­ployee will also be paid in lieu of the no­tice pe­riod in their employment con­tract. This can be up to three months’ salary.</p>
    <p>The ben­e­fits are in ac­cor­dance with the group’s col­lec­tive agree­ments with its unions.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, SIA an­nounced that it would cut about 20 per cent of its staff strength, or 4,300 po­si­tions, amid the Covid-19 pandemic that has paral­ysed the air travel sec­tor.</p>
    <p>About 2,400 staff will be re­trenched, while the re­main­ing 1,900 roles will be ac­counted for through nat­u­ral at­tri­tion, a re­cruit</p>
    <p>ment freeze and vol­un­tary-de­par­ture schemes.</p>
    <p>The vast ma­jor­ity of those af­fected are for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>Asked about re­trench­ment ben­e­fits, SIA’s spokesman said: “Dis­cus­sions have be­gun with our Sin­ga­pore-based unions. SIA is work­ing closely with them to fi­nalise the ar­range­ments for those who are af­fected so as to min­imise the stress and anx­i­ety on our peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>For for­eign staff af­fected, ar­range­ments will be made and suf­fi­cient time given for those who are cur­rently over­seas to re­turn to Sin­ga­pore to set­tle their af­fairs here.</p>
    <p>The spokesman said: “Our col­leagues who are still in Sin­ga­pore will also be given suf­fi­cient time to set­tle their per­sonal af­fairs be­fore re­turn­ing to their home coun­tries.”</p>
    <p>Scoot, the group’s bud­get arm, started hand­ing out pink slips to re­trenched staff yes­ter­day, with de­tails on com­pen­sa­tion pack­ages.</p>
    <p>Said its spokesman: “Scoot will no­tify our af­fected em­ploy­ees and pro­vide them with more in­for­ma­tion on the ar­range­ments pro­gres­sively from to­day across the next few days.”</p>
    <p>Af­fected em­ploy­ees will re­ceive com­pen­sa­tion on terms that have been ne­go­ti­ated and agreed with the union in the col­lec­tive agree­ment, she said. Among other things, af­fected staff will con­tinue to be cov­ered for hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion and surgical ex­penses till March 31 next year, and where re­quired, given repa­tri­a­tion sup­port.</p>
    <p>Added the Scoot spokesman: “We are com­mit­ted to en­sur­ing they are</p>
    <p>pro­vided with ap­pro­pri­ate sup­port and re­sources, and have ar­ranged for pro­fes­sional coun­sel­lors and a repa­tri­a­tion and re­lo­ca­tion con­sul­tant to be present at the ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>“Scoot also ar­ranged for trans­port home for the af­fected staff by taxi or pri­vate-hire ve­hi­cle ser­vices af­ter the ex­er­cise, and plans to pub­lish an alumni talent di­rec­tory to con­nect de­part­ing em­ploy­ees with po­ten­tial em­ploy­ers.”</p>
    <p>As for the par­ent na­tional car­rier, the re­trench­ment ex­er­cise will start on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Af­fected staff have started to re­ceive e-mails in­form­ing them of al­lo­cated dates for brief­ings, which will be con­ducted ei­ther phys­i­cally at the SIA Train­ing Cen­tre or over the phone if the staff mem­ber is cur­rently over­seas.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times also un­der­stands that the Air Line Pi­lots As­so­ci­a­tion – Sin­ga­pore has re­quested a meeting with the Min­istry of Man­power next week, al­though it is not clear what will be dis­cussed.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) said it could not re­spond to queries on the num­ber of union mem­bers af­fected and the re­trench­ment pack­ages its unions are seek­ing, cit­ing sen­si­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>An NTUC spokesman would say only that those af­fected in­clude mem­bers of the Scoot Staff Union and Sin­ga­pore Air­lines Staff Union, both of which are NTUCaf­fil­i­ated.</p>
    <p>Dis­cus­sions have be­gun with our Sin­ga­pore-based unions. SIA is work­ing closely with them to fi­nalise the ar­range­ments for those who are af­fected so as to min­imise the stress and anx­i­ety on our peo­ple.</p>
