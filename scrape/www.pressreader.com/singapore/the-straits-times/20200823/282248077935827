    <p>For the first 12 years after start­ing her com­pany, Ms Reene Ho-Phang did not take leave.</p>
    <p>As the co-founder of BrandS­tory, a strate­gic travel mar­ket­ing con­sul­tancy, she had eight of­fices around the re­gion to man­age and clients as far away as Azer­bai­jan and Ice­land to ser­vice.</p>
    <p>The only times she man­aged to get away were when her clients’ of­fices closed for Christ­mas and Chi­nese New Year.</p>
    <p>In late Jan­uary this year, she and her hus­band Peter Phang, 50, who runs the com­pany with her, flew back to Sin­ga­pore from their base in Shang­hai for Year of the Rat cel­e­bra­tions with their ex­tended fam­ily.</p>
    <p>On the sev­enth day of Chi­nese New Year – a sig­nif­i­cant oc­ca­sion known as Every­one’s Birth­day – her fa­ther sud­denly died at age 78. A re­tired civil ser­vant, he had looked after fi­nance for BrandS­tory’s head­quar­ters here.</p>
    <p>“It was...” Ms Ho-Phang trails off and clears her throat, “... the low­est point for me.”</p>
    <p>At the same time, a lock­down was de­clared on Wuhan, as a mys­te­ri­ous virus gripped the Chi­nese city she fre­quented for busi­ness.</p>
    <p>She watched with dis­may as “things started to un­ravel” as Covid-19 con­tain­ment mea­sures in China, and then around the world, dis­rupted her busi­ness, which dropped by up to 80 per cent in some mar­kets.</p>
    <p>She found her­self con­sol­ing a col­league in China, who was cry­ing over the short­age of masks there, and pack­ing boxes of the item to send over to friends and as­so­ciates there.</p>
    <p>Seven months later, she counts her fa­ther’s pass­ing as a bless­ing in dis­guise.</p>
    <p>“My dad prob­a­bly saved me and kept me safe here,” she says pen­sively. “I’m grate­ful to him be­cause I could have been locked down in Wuhan.”</p>
    <p>Pe­tite and el­e­gant with a ready laugh, Ms Ho-Phang is one of the many in­trepid Sin­ga­pore­ans who have ven­tured over­seas to set up busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Pop­u­la­tion In Brief 2019, an an­nual gov­ern­ment pub­li­ca­tion, there were 217,200 over­seas Sin­ga­pore­ans. The Sin­ga­pore Global Net­work, which sup­ports this com­mu­nity, does not have fig­ures on the num­ber of busi­ness own­ers among them.</p>
    <p>While many of these over­seas­based en­trepreneur­s have been hit by the pan­demic’s af­ter­shock, they are doggedly forg­ing new paths with a never-say-die at­ti­tude.</p>
    <p>Ask Ms Ho-Phang about her age and the 50-year-old says “for­ever 33”, a nod to the time when she formed her com­pany in 2003.</p>
    <p>As cor­po­rate di­rec­tor of re­sort chain Banyan Tree, she had vis­ited Shang­hai and Bei­jing for work, then found her­self un­able to re­turn home for a cou­ple of weeks be­cause of the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome (Sars) out­break.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing her ex­tended stay i n Bei­jing, she wrote a busi­ness plan for an idea of a tourism con­sul­tancy, tar­geted at new mar­kets, which she had long been mulling over. She was i nspired by her former bosses at Banyan Tree who con­vinced her that com­pa­nies, no mat­ter how small, must be global in out­look.</p>
    <p>She says of her de­ci­sion to base her­self in China: “Let’s take the biggest chal­lenge first, the biggest mar­ket first. Then the rest of the mar­kets will be easy. That was what I told my­self at that time.”</p>
    <p>She con­vinced her hus­band to quit his job in health­care here and join her. While run­ning her fledg­ling con­sul­tancy, she was sur­prised to find her­self preg­nant – doc­tors had asked her to re­lax be­cause she had prob­lems con­ceiv­ing.</p>
    <p>Jug­gling a grow­ing busi­ness and an ex­pand­ing belly, she sol­diered on. Her par­ents lived with the cou­ple in Shang­hai for about six years to care for daugh­ter Nathaniell­e. The slog was worth it as the in­dus­try grew ex­po­nen­tially and her firm with it. “It was non-stop. We were very grate­ful be­cause we rode the boom of China,” she says.</p>
    <p>BrandS­tory’s suc­cess did not go un­no­ticed. It was ranked No. 34 on a list of 85 firms cel­e­brated as Sin­ga­pore’s fastest-grow­ing com­pa­nies last year by The Straits Times and Ger­many-based global re­search firm Statista, based on rev­enue growth from 2014 to 2017.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing that pe­riod, her firm grew 246 per cent with a rev­enue of $2.35 mil­lion in 2017. It was also the only ad­ver­tis­ing and pub­lic re­la­tions com­pany among the top 50 awardees. It counts among its clients tourism au­thor­i­ties from Europe, the Mid­dle East and Aus­tralia, as well as key des­ti­na­tions in the United States such as Las Ve­gas and Hawaii.</p>
    <p>BrandS­tory grew to 50 staff at its peak, with of­fices in Shang­hai, Bei­jing, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Hong Kong, Taipei, Kuala Lumpur and Sin­ga­pore. It bagged nu­mer­ous travel in­dus­try ac­co­lades along the way, but what kept her go­ing was the chal­lenge of in­tro­duc­ing new des­ti­na­tions like Qatar to Asian trav­ellers. “We bridge the cul­tures of dif­fer­ent lands,” she says.</p>
    <p>The “non-stop” na­ture of her job also meant she had to find cre­ative ways to fit in time with her fam­ily. She re­calls do­ing “crazy trips” like fly­ing for 24 hours from Hawaii to Seat­tle and then to Sin­ga­pore, just to at­tend a cousin’s wed­ding.</p>
    <p>All that ground to a halt with the cir­cuit breaker in April and May.</p>
    <p>“Wow,” she says, sigh­ing deeply and then chuck­ling when asked about what she did.</p>
    <p>“For some­one quite ac­tive, it was quite a re­fresh­ing change. Fi­nally, you had no ex­cuse but to clean your store­room,” she says, ges­tur­ing to the wall of cup­boards in her semide­tached house in the east that dis­plays her travel sou­venirs, like a bear from Lon­don and a ukulele from Hawaii.</p>
    <p>She bonded over duri­ans with her mother, tried gar­den­ing with her hus­band and caught up with friends here and over­seas.</p>
    <p>Most im­por­tantly, she had more time with Nathaniell­e, now 16, whom she had left in the care of her par­ents here since pri­mary school. She had made the “heart-wrench­ing” de­ci­sion so her daugh­ter could have a “very good bilin­gual ed­u­ca­tion”, as she was not sat­is­fied with the qual­ity of schools in China in the early years.</p>
    <p>Long-dis­tance par­ent­ing meant that rou­tine tasks like spell­ing drills were con­ducted via WeChat.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, mother and daugh­ter bonded in the kitchen as Nathaniell­e loves cook­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Ho-Phang also made good on her “over­due” prom­ise to get her a dog, buy­ing a minia­ture toy poo­dle named Char­coal.</p>
    <p>She is touched that Nathaniell­e trusts her enough to share “small lit­tle de­tails” about her life, like what her friends are say­ing. “It’s much more than any­thing I could have achieved,” she says, her voice heavy with emo­tion.</p>
    <p>Even as she set­tled into a home­based rou­tine, Ms Ho-Phang hatched plans to save her team and re­de­ploy its tal­ent.</p>
    <p>She has brewed two start-ups dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker – one is a “dig­i­tal life­style ex­pe­ri­ence” that brings “trea­sures of the world”, such as hand-wo­ven car­pets from Azer­bai­jan and am­ber from Lithua­nia, to Gen­er­a­tion Z and mil­len­nial con­sumers; while the other cu­rates “daily life­style tools” like spe­cial­ity soaps for the “‘new nor­mal’ way of life”, she says. Both are tar­geted to launch by the end of next month.</p>
    <p>So­cial Sto­ries, a dig­i­tal so­cial me­dia agency she started about three years ago, is also branch­ing out to ser­vice clients in other in­dus­tries, such as Oribe, a hair and beauty care brand.</p>
    <p>While she is en­cour­ag­ing her team of 25 to de­velop new skills, she re­ports that busi­ness has picked up over the past two weeks. The firm is start­ing on new bids and re­cov­ery plans for its travel desti­na­tion clients. At­trac­tions are re­open­ing in China, which is a good sign.</p>
    <p>“Travel has be­come a very im­por­tant part of the econ­omy in many coun­tries, so it’s about how to re­open in a very safe man­ner. We have dif­fi­cult chal­lenges to com­mu­ni­cate a travel ex­pe­ri­ence that is quite dif­fer­ent from the past,” she says.</p>
    <p>She is adamant that she is “not done yet” pro­fes­sion­ally, even though Covid-19 may have eroded much of her fi­nan­cial gains from build­ing a busi­ness in China over the last 17 years. De­trac­tors have told her she could have pas­sively made the same gains from in­vest­ing in Shang­hai prop­erty all those years ago, but she begs to dif­fer.</p>
    <p>“It would not have been a great jour­ney. What we have gained in sum is worth much more.”</p>
    <p>Like the rain­bow emo­jis that pep­per her What­sApp mes­sages, Ms Ho-Phang’s out­look is de­cid­edly pos­i­tive de­spite the gloomy eco­nomic weather fore­cast.</p>
    <p>“This ex­pe­ri­ence must teach us some­thing. We must get the most out of it and not waste it.”</p>
