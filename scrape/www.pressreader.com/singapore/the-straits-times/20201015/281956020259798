    <p>The tim­ing of re­cently an­nounced price and fee hikes was called into ques­tion by Non-Con­stituency MP Leong Mun Wai in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing dur­ing the debate on the Gov­ern­ment’s Covid-19 strat­egy, the Progress Sin­ga­pore Party NCMP said it is con­tra­dic­tory for the Gov­ern­ment to be rais­ing costs while pledg­ing sup­port mea­sures, and ques­tioned if the na­tional cof­fers were truly over­stretched.</p>
    <p>He cited a re­cent two-week pe­riod when cost in­creases were an­nounced. On Sept 29, it was an­nounced that MediShield Life pre­mi­ums will in­crease be­tween 11.5 per cent and 35.4 per cent from early next year. That means an in­crease in the an­nual pre­mium from $1,000 to $1,350, said Mr Leong. The in­creased cov­er­age that comes along­side the pre­mium hike is of “scant com­fort to Sin­ga­pore­ans who are still strug­gling with the fi­nan­cial woes of Covid-19”, he added.</p>
    <p>On Sept 30, SP Group an­nounced a 9.3 per cent elec­tric­ity tar­iff hike for Oc­to­ber to De­cem­ber. Mr Leong said while the in­crease is due to the higher costs borne by power-gen­er­at­ing firms, “SP Group could have eas­ily ab­sorbed the in­crease from the past prof­its it has earned in­stead of pass­ing the in­creased cost on to con­sumers”.</p>
    <p>He added: “The Gov­ern­ment does not in­spire con­fi­dence by hastily in­creas­ing taxes and fees while at the same time pledg­ing Covid-19 sup­port mea­sures. Our pop­u­la­tion could view this act as ‘giv­ing with one hand and tak­ing with the other’.”</p>
    <p>He also noted last week’s an­nounce­ment that Elec­tronic Road Pric­ing (ERP) rates at six gantries on the Cen­tral Ex­press­way were to in­crease by $1 from Mon­day to ease peak-pe­riod con­ges­tion.</p>
    <p>These moves add hun­dreds of dol­lars to the house­hold ex­pen­di­tures of av­er­age Sin­ga­pore­ans, and raise con­cerns such as whether the goods and ser­vices tax will be in­creased soon af­ter next year, he said.</p>
    <p>“Can these hikes not be shelved till later? Can SP Group not ab­sorb the tar­iff in­creases with their past prof­its? Can’t ERP in­creases wait? Can’t pre­mium in­creases be de­ferred for a pe­riod of one to two years, as the cur­rent in­sur­ance claims are still way be­low the col­lected pre­mi­ums af­ter all?” he asked.</p>
    <p>He also said that while the Gov­ern­ment does not want to dis­close the size of the na­tional re­serves for se­cu­rity rea­sons, it has pub­lished de­tailed an­nual fi­nan­cial in­for­ma­tion on Sin­ga­pore’s as­sets and li­a­bil­i­ties. “In its lat­est Gov­ern­ment Fi­nan­cial State­ments as at end March 2020, it was re­ported that we own a to­tal of $1.35 tril­lion in fi­nan­cial as­sets,” he noted. Tak­ing into ac­count the Net In­vest­ment Re­turns Con­tri­bu­tion, he said the de­crease in Sin­ga­pore’s fi­nan­cial as­sets is $14.8 bil­lion. “We have used up only 1.1 per cent of our to­tal fi­nan­cial as­sets to fight Covid-19 in 2020. It ap­pears there is no need for the tax and fee hikes to take place so soon.”</p>
    <p>He also called for a re­view of safety net poli­cies such as MediShield Life and HDB flat leases, to build Sin­ga­pore­ans’ con­fi­dence in fac­ing eco­nomic chal­lenges and de­velop cre­ativ­ity, in­no­va­tion and en­trepreneur­ship.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Progress Sin&#xAD;ga&#xAD;pore Party Non-Con&#xAD;stituency MP Leong Mun Wai ques&#xAD;tioned why SP Group could not ab&#xAD;sorb the higher costs with its past prof&#xAD;its in&#xAD;stead of pass&#xAD;ing them on to con&#xAD;sumers. Sec&#xAD;ond Min&#xAD;is&#xAD;ter for Trade and In&#xAD;dus&#xAD;try Tan See Leng said elec&#xAD;tric&#xAD;ity tar&#xAD;iffs col&#xAD;lected by SP Group do not go to its prof&#xAD;its, but to the power-gen&#xAD;er&#xAD;a&#xAD;tion com&#xAD;pa&#xAD;nies that have in&#xAD;curred higher pro&#xAD;duc&#xAD;tion costs, given the in&#xAD;crease in global fuel prices.</p>
