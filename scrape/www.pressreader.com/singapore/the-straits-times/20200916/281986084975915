    <p>BEI­JING • Euro­pean Union lead­ers struck a hawk­ish tone at the end of Mon­day’s China-EU lead­ers’ sum­mit, but Bei­jing ap­peared to put a more pos­i­tive spin on the meet­ing, with read­outs prais­ing the agree­ments made by lead­ers and reams of ed­i­to­ri­als about the strength of ties with Brus­sels.</p>
    <p>As China’s re­la­tion­ship with the United States con­tin­ues to de­te­ri­o­rate, there is a con­certed ef­fort to work on ties with the EU, which is Bei­jing’s largest trad­ing part­ner.</p>
    <p>But, with each of the EU’s 27 mem­ber states hav­ing its own for­eign pol­icy stance to­wards China, the task is a com­plex and nu­anced one.</p>
    <p>At the heart of those ef­forts are ne­go­ti­a­tions sur­round­ing a China-EU in­vest­ment agree­ment, which has been un­der dis­cus­sion for seven years and count­ing.</p>
    <p>Europe is seek­ing a level play­ing field for its com­pa­nies op­er­at­ing in China – this would mean re­duc­ing sup­port for state-linked and state-owned en­ter­prises in key in­dus­tries, an is­sue on which Bei­jing is un­likely to budge.</p>
    <p>The EU needs a pack­age it can mar­ket to all mem­ber states, 26 of which are al­ready cov­ered by ba­sic in­vest­ment protection treaties with China.</p>
    <p>Mon­day’s ses­sion was thus ini­tially billed as a meet­ing to iron out the kinks. But, de­pend­ing on which side the me­dia re­ports were from, the par­ties are ei­ther on the cusp of reach­ing a deal or have made no fur­ther progress be­cause of China’s un­will­ing­ness to com­pro­mise.</p>
    <p>Lead­ers agreed to “strengthen com­mu­ni­ca­tion and co­op­er­a­tion” to en­sure the suc­cess of a “ma­jor po­lit­i­cal agenda” be­tween the EU and China, said a read­out from the of­fi­cial Xinhua News Agency. It added that Chi­nese mar­kets re­main open to Euro­pean busi­nesses, while hint­ing that the in­vest­ment agree­ment could be signed as soon as this year.</p>
    <p>In con­trast to the US, the EU has “in­vari­ably made great ef­forts to work with China to up­hold these mul­ti­lat­eral agree­ments”, the state-owned China Daily wrote in an ed­i­to­rial.</p>
    <p>It added: “Thus the video meet­ing be­tween Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping... and the EU lead­ers on Mon­day sought to con­tinue to steer the Sino-EU re­la­tion­ship clear of any sub­merged rocks and keep it pro­gress­ing in the right di­rec­tion.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the talks, Mr Xi also set out “four prin­ci­ples” as the ba­sis for the China-EU re­la­tion­ship, in­clud­ing “peace­ful co­ex­is­tence”, “open­ness and co­op­er­a­tion”, “mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism” and “di­a­logue and con­sul­ta­tion” – an oblique ref­er­ence to what has gone wrong in China’s deal­ings with a more in­ward-look­ing and ag­gres­sive US.</p>
    <p>Xinhua said Mr Xi “clar­i­fied” that China’s po­si­tion on Xin­jiang and Hong Kong, both ar­eas where Bei­jing has been ac­cused of hu­man rights abuses, was a mat­ter of na­tional sovereignt­y and sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>“There is no one-size-fits-all path to hu­man rights de­vel­op­ment in the world. There is no best way, only the bet­ter one,” Xinhua quoted Mr Xi as say­ing.</p>
    <p>He added that China would not ac­cept dou­ble stan­dards or “an in­struc­tor” on hu­man rights.</p>
    <p>“The hu­man rights is­sue has clouded trade talks,” Pro­fes­sor Wang Yi­wei, Jean Mon­net chair pro­fes­sor at Ren­min Univer­sity, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>There are trade and com­pe­ti­tion is­sues too, but Euro­pean coun­tries have been fram­ing them in terms of hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions, he said.</p>
    <p>Yet, in re­cent weeks, se­nior Chi­nese diplo­mats trav­elled to Europe for meet­ings with their coun­ter­parts in a bid for “dam­age con­trol” and to sweeten the ground for the in­vest­ment agree­ment after EU mem­ber states emerged as some of the strong­est crit­ics of China’s hu­man rights record.</p>
    <p>In re­cent weeks, China and the Czech Repub­lic were locked in a diplo­matic fra­cas after Czech Se­nate pres­i­dent Mi­los Vys­tr­cil led a del­e­ga­tion to Tai­wan, call­ing him­self “Tai­wanese”. China considers the self-rul­ing is­land a rene­gade prov­ince that needs to be re­taken by force if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Mr Vys­tr­cil has since walked back his com­ments, with Czech Pres­i­dent Mi­los Ze­man – who favours closer ties with Bei­jing – ac­cus­ing the politi­cian of “boy­ish provo­ca­tion”.</p>
    <p>In the fi­nal anal­y­sis, there might be nec­es­sary trade-offs in the long run for closer eco­nomic ties be­tween Bei­jing and Brus­sels.</p>
    <p>“(Europe) is where China’s hopes lie after China-US re­la­tions (have) passed their point of no re­turn,” Prof Wang said.</p>
    <p>“The hu­man rights is­sue has clouded trade talks,” said Pro­fes­sor Wang Yi­wei, Jean Mon­net chair pro­fes­sor at Ren­min Univer­sity. There are trade and com­pe­ti­tion is­sues too, but Euro­pean coun­tries have been fram­ing them in terms of hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions, he said.</p>
