    <p>The largest Protes­tant de­nom­i­na­tion in Sin­ga­pore of­fi­cially ap­pointed its new bishop yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Bishop Gor­don Wong, 59, will over­see 46 Methodist churches, with more than 44,000 mem­bers.</p>
    <p>He will also pro­vide coun­sel to 15 Methodist schools and sup­port the Methodist Church’s so­cial ser­vice arm, Methodist Wel­fare Ser­vices, which runs 20 com­mu­ni­ty­based care cen­tres and pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Dr Wong said the Covid-19 pan­demic has sur­faced new vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties in so­ci­ety – in­clud­ing those af­fected by the eco­nomic fall­out from the cri­sis – and high­lighted the plight of for­eign work­ers who have been sep­a­rated from their fam­i­lies for a long time.</p>
    <p>He told The Straits Times: “The pri­or­ity for the Methodist Church should be the pri­or­ity for any church... how we can show love to one an­other, and our neigh­bours, in the midst of this very dis­tress­ing and dif­fi­cult pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>The mar­ried fa­ther of two chil­dren suc­ceeds Dr Chong Chin Chung, 65, who is re­tir­ing af­ter four years at the helm.</p>
    <p>Dr Wong, who was elected from 46 can­di­dates at the Church’s 12th gen­eral con­fer­ence, be­gan serv­ing as a Methodist pas­tor in 1986.</p>
    <p>He is wrap­ping up his sec­ond term as pres­i­dent of the Trin­ity An­nual Con­fer­ence (Trac), a branch of the Methodist Church com­pris­ing 21 churches.</p>
    <p>These branches were orig­i­nally or­gan­ised along lan­guage lines, with Trac cater­ing to the English­s­peak­ing con­gre­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Wong is re­spected among Methodists, with those who have worked with him speak­ing highly of his con­sul­ta­tive lead­er­ship style and open-mind­ed­ness.</p>
    <p>Rev­erend Khoo Kay Huat, 41, who is chair­man of the Trac Board of Youth Min­istry, said Dr Wong is car­ing and nur­tur­ing. “He doesn’t put on airs, and he doesn’t lord over peo­ple. He is also open to new ideas and try­ing new ideas.”</p>
    <p>In his new role, Dr Wong will also rep­re­sent and over­see the in­ter­ac­tions of the Methodist Church in Sin­ga­pore – which marks its 135th an­niver­sary this year – with others, in­clud­ing the Gov­ern­ment and in­ter­faith groups.</p>
    <p>He said he is par­tic­u­larly con­cerned about the threat of grow­ing po­lar­i­sa­tion in so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>“We all have the right to dis­agree but no one has the right to be dis­agree­able,” he said. In­stead, how so­ci­ety can unite is by do­ing good for one an­other, and work­ing to­gether to help those who are most in need, he added.</p>
