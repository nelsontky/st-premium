    <p>A 26-year-old man yes­ter­day pleaded guilty to tak­ing ex­plicit up­skirt and up­shirt videos al­most daily for a pe­riod of more than five months in 2018, when he was a psy­chol­ogy un­der­grad­u­ate at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity (NTU).</p>
    <p>In to­tal, 334 un­known women fell vic­tim to the man, Shaun Ho Yan Liang, be­tween Fe­bru­ary and July 2018 at var­i­ous lo­ca­tions, in­clud­ing his univer­sity cam­pus.</p>
    <p>His crimes came to light when he was caught in the act by the boyfriend of one of his vic­tims in a FairPrice out­let at East­point Mall, in Simei.</p>
    <p>He was con­victed of two charges of in­sult­ing the women’s modesty, as well as one charge of be­ing in pos­ses­sion of ob­scene videos.</p>
    <p>One other charge un­der the Films Act will be taken into con­sid­er­a­tion for his sen­tenc­ing, sched­uled for next Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The court heard that on July 22, 2018, Ho fol­lowed the woman around the su­per­mar­ket, record­ing videos of her but­tocks and un­der­shirt area be­tween 8.40pm and 8.55pm.</p>
    <p>He took 10 videos of her by stand­ing or squat­ting di­rectly be­hind her and po­si­tion­ing his blue Sam­sung S9 mo­bile phone below the waist level and close to ground level, with the rear cam­era of the phone pointed up­wards, to film up­shirt and up­skirt videos.</p>
    <p>She was wear­ing denim shorts and a loose white T-shirt at the time.</p>
    <p>Us­ing a phone app called BVR, he was able to record the videos on his phone with a blank screen.</p>
    <p>The woman’s boyfriend at the time caught Ho with his phone pointed un­der her shirt, de­tained him and re­ported the in­ci­dent to the store’s se­cu­rity of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties later found 459 videos of fe­male vic­tims on Ho’s phone. On each oc­ca­sion, Ho tar­geted women wear­ing shorts or skirts whom he found at­trac­tive.</p>
    <p>He would use his phone cam­era to record a video of the woman’s breasts, un­der­shirt or crotch by stand­ing or squat­ting close to her.</p>
    <p>Aside from East­point Mall, he ad­mit­ted to tak­ing videos of the women at var­i­ous other lo­ca­tions, in­clud­ing a lab­o­ra­tory at the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Ed­u­ca­tion’s School of Science, an over­head bridge at NTU, and the stu­dent ac­tiv­ity cen­tre lo­cated at the North Spine of NTU.</p>
    <p>Ho would even record the videos of his vic­tims dur­ing lessons at NTU.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties also found 106 ob­scene and porno­graphic video on Ho’s lap­top.</p>
    <p>NTU yes­ter­day said Ho is no longer at­tend­ing classes at the univer­sity, and will face dis­ci­plinary ac­tion after he is sen­tenced by the court.</p>
