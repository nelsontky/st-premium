    <p>Co m m o d i t i e s trader Trafigura Group is hir­ing Te­masek In­ter­na­tional ex­ec­u­tive Khodor Mat­tar, as it seeks to team up with the world’s big­gest pri­vate equity firms and sov­er­eign funds for in­vest­ments, peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said.</p>
    <p>Mr Mat­tar is join­ing Trafigura in a newly cre­ated po­si­tion as head of cap­i­tal de­vel­op­ment, the peo­ple said, ask­ing not to be iden­ti­fied be­cause the in­for­ma­tion is pri­vate. He is now a manag­ing direc­tor for the Amer­i­cas at Te­masek, the Sin­ga­pore in­vest­ment firm.</p>
    <p>In his new role, Mr Mat­tar will de­velop debt and equity part­ner­ships with top al­ter­na­tive cap­i­tal providers, the peo­ple said. Trafigura aims to team up with these funds for in­vest­ments that will help it ex­pand across petroleum prod­ucts, me­tals and min­er­als as well as re­new­ables.</p>
    <p>Mr Mat­tar plans to move from New York to Geneva next year, ac­cord­ing to the peo­ple. Rep­re­sen­ta­tives for Trafigura and Te­masek de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>The move shows the ef­forts by large com­modi­ties traders to find al­ter­na­tive fi­nanc­ing meth­ods at a time when con­ven­tional lenders are get­ting more con­ser­va­tive in ex­tend­ing their bal­ance sheets.</p>
    <p>ABN Amro Bank said in Au­gust that it would quit the com­mod­ity and trade fi­nance busi­ness, while BNP Paribas is also re­view­ing its in­volve­ment and may shut down its spe­cialised unit.</p>
    <p>Trafigura, the world’s sec­ond­biggest in­de­pen­dent oil and me­tals trader, has thrived amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic as it ben­e­fited from sup­ply and de­mand dis­rup­tions. The com­pany’s net in­come rose 27 per cent to US$542 mil­lion (S$731 mil­lion) for the six months to March 3.</p>
    <p>Mr Mat­tar has a back­ground as an en­ergy banker and has spent nearly nine years with Te­masek in Sin­ga­pore and New York.</p>
    <p>Trafigura set up a joint ven­ture with Abu Dhabi wealth fund Mubadala In­vest­ment in 2015 to buy base me­tals as­sets. This year, it teamed up with Aus­tralian fund man­ager IFM In­vestors to form Nala Re­new­ables, which is seek­ing to in­vest in 2 gi­gawatts worth of so­lar, wind and power stor­age projects. Trafigura has 80 of­fices in 41 coun­tries.</p>
