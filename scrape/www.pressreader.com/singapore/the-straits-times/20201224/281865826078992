    <p>Rel­a­tives of Boe­ing 737 Max crash vic­tims have urged the Euro­pean Union Avi­a­tion Safety Agency (EASA) to de­lay ap­prov­ing the air­craft’s re­turn to ser­vice, say­ing there are unan­swered ques­tions about its safety.</p>
    <p>Last month, the United States Fed­eral Avi­a­tion Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FAA) cleared the jet fol­low­ing de­sign changes around sys­tems in­volved in two crashes that to­gether killed 346 peo­ple in 2018 and last year, spark­ing a global ground­ing and safety re­views.</p>
    <p>EASA has said it could for­mally lift its own ban next month, once pub­lic and in­dus­try feed­back on its con­di­tions for putting the jet back into ser­vice has been stud­ied.</p>
    <p>In a let­ter to EASA ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Pa­trick Ky and in com­ments filed with the agency on Tues­day, rel­a­tives and friends of Ethiopian Air­lines crash vic­tims said it should first fin­ish its anal­y­sis of the mod­i­fied air­craft and com­plete its safety re­port on the crash.</p>
    <p>“It would be im­pos­si­ble for EASA to con­clude that the re­vised 737 Max is safe be­fore its own safety as­sess­ment is com­plete,” they said in the let­ter.</p>
    <p>An EASA spokesman said the agency does not com­ment on any re­ceived feed­back at this stage of the re­cer­ti­fi­ca­tion process.</p>
    <p>It plans to pub­lish the fi­nal air­wor­thi­ness di­rec­tive next month, once all the feed­back has been re­viewed, he said.</p>
    <p>The fam­i­lies also called into ques­tion the FAA’s de­ci­sion to lift its flight ban fol­low­ing a Se­nate Com­merce Com­mit­tee re­port last Fri­day that con­cluded the agency and Boe­ing of­fi­cials col­luded dur­ing 737 Max re­cer­ti­fi­ca­tion test­ing.</p>
    <p>Alaska Air Group an­nounced on Tues­day that it is boost­ing an or­der agree­ment with Boe­ing to buy 68 737 Max jets, but­tress­ing Boe­ing’s ef­fort to sell the Max amid the long­est ground­ing in US his­tory.</p>
