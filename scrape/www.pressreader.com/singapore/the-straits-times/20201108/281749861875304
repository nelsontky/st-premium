    <p>What hap­pens to the rest of my CPF sav­ings once I meet the Full Re­tire­ment Sum?</p>
    <p>You will be able to with­draw your Spe­cial and Or­di­nary Ac­count sav­ings after set­ting aside your co­hort’s Full Re­tire­ment Sum fully with cash or the Ba­sic Re­tire­ment Sum with a suf­fi­cient prop­erty pledge.</p>
    <p>If you don’t have an im­me­di­ate need for these sav­ings, you can con­sider leav­ing it in your Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) ac­count to earn at­trac­tive in­ter­est. You can al­ways with­draw them fully or par­tially as and when you like. With PayNow, you can re­ceive the with­drawn money al­most in­stan­ta­neously.</p>
    <p>If you would like to re­ceive higher pay­outs in re­tire­ment, you can also trans­fer these sav­ings, up to the cur­rent En­hanced Re­tire­ment Sum, to your Re­tire­ment Ac­count (RA). For ex­am­ple, if a mem­ber turn­ing 55 in 2020 sets aside the Full Re­tire­ment Sum of $181,000, he will re­ceive about $1,390 to $1,490 in life­long monthly pay­outs on the CPF Life Stan­dard Plan from age 65.</p>
    <p>By set­ting aside the higher En­hanced Re­tire­ment Sum of $271,500 at age 55, his life­long monthly pay­outs un­der the CPF Life Stan­dard Plan will in­crease to be­tween $2,030 and $2,180.</p>
    <p>How can I in­crease my CPF re­tire­ment pay­outs?</p>
    <p>You can in­crease your CPF re­tire­ment pay­outs through:</p>
    <p>a) Cash top-ups or CPF trans­fers</p>
    <p>You can make cash top-ups or CPF trans­fers to ei­ther the Spe­cial Ac­count if you are be­low 55 years old or the R A if you are 55 years old and above. Top­ping up in cash lets you en­joy tax re­lief of up to $7,000 per cal­en­dar year.</p>
    <p>b) De­fer­ring the start of your pay­outs</p>
    <p>You can start your re­tire­ment pay­outs any­time from age 65. How­ever, if you are still work­ing or have other sources of in­come, you may wish to de­fer re­ceiv­ing your pay­outs.</p>
    <p>This will en­able your sav­ings to ac­cu­mu­late at­trac­tive in­ter­est of up to 6 per cent per an­num, which will boost your fu­ture re­tire­ment pay­outs.</p>
    <p>If you are on CPF Life, your monthly pay­outs will in­crease by up to 7 per cent per an­num for each year that you de­fer pay­ments by. The lat­est you can start your pay­outs at is age 70.</p>
    <p>My father has been self-em­ployed all his life and he has very low CPF sav­ings. Should I top up his CPF ac­count for him?</p>
    <p>Top­ping up your father’s CPF ac­count is a good way to show your love.</p>
    <p>Your father will en­joy at­trac­tive CPF in­ter­est rates of up to 6 per cent per an­num on his re­tire­ment sav­ings. With more sav­ings in his R A , your father will re­ceive higher monthly pay­outs in his re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>What’s more, you can also en­joy tax re­lief of up to $7,000 per cal­en­dar year when you top up your father ’s R A with cash.</p>

    <p>Next Jan­uary, the Matched Re­tire­ment Sav­ings Scheme (MRSS) will be im­ple­mented to help lower-to-mid­dle in­come se­niors, who have yet to meet the Ba­sic Re­tire­ment Sum, save more for re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>Un­der the scheme, the Gov­ern­ment will match ev­ery dol­lar of cash top-up made to the R A of el­i­gi­ble mem­bers up to an an­nual cap of $600.</p>
    <p>CPF Board will au­to­mat­i­cally as­sess mem­bers’ el­i­gi­bil­ity for the MRSS each year and no­tify el­i­gi­ble mem­bers ev­ery Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Why do I need to pay back in­ter­est on my CPF sav­ings when I sell my prop­erty?</p>
    <p>This is be­cause if you had not used CPF to buy the prop­erty, your CPF sav­ings would have earned in­ter­est. Re­fund­ing your CPF sav­ings plus ac­crued in­ter­est when you sell the prop­erty re­stores your CPF sav­ings to what it would have been had you not with­drawn it to pur­chase a prop­erty.</p>
    <p>That said, you can con­tinue to use your CPF sav­ings, in­clud­ing the re­funded amount from the pre­vi­ous prop­erty, to buy an­other prop­erty.</p>
    <p>We have come across CPF mem­bers who are wor­ried that they have to cough up cash to top up their CPF be­cause the sell­ing price of their prop­erty is not enough to fully pay back their CPF sav­ings. There’s no need to worry about this; you don’t have to top up cash if you sell your prop­erty at mar­ket value.</p>
    <p>I heard I can make a vol­un­tary re­fund to my CPF based on how much I have used for hous­ing. What are the ad­van­tages of do­ing so and how can I do so?</p>
    <p>Yes, you can in­deed choose to make a re­fund to your CPF ac­count with­out sell­ing your prop­erty via the vol­un­tary hous­ing re­fund.</p>
    <p>By mak­ing a vol­un­tary hous­ing re­fund, you re­duce the amount that you would need to re­turn to your CPF ac­count when you sell your prop­erty. This re­funded amount will also start earn­ing at­trac­tive CPF in­ter­est to boost your CPF sav­ings for re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>Re­duc­ing the amount you would need to re­turn to your CPF ac­count means you may re­ceive more cash pro­ceeds upon the sale of your home, which can help you pay for any re­quired cash out­lay when you buy your next prop­erty.</p>
