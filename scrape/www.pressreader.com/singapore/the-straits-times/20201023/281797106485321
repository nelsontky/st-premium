    <p>BANGKOK • With an in­tel­li­gence net­work so good that it has been com­pared with the CIA, Thai street ven­dors are of­ten first on the scene at “guerilla” democ­racy protests in Bangkok, where they hawk sour pork and fish­balls to a democ­racy-hun­gry crowd.</p>
    <p>After a govern­ment crack­down last week, protest groups have be­gun keep­ing the venues for their de­mon­stra­tions de­mand­ing the res­ig­na­tion of Premier Prayut Chan-o-cha se­cret un­til the last minute, in a bid to out­smart the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>But pro­test­ers have quickly no­ticed that they are of­ten sec­ond on the scene, be­hind food ven­dors set­ting up their carts and ready­ing them­selves for a busy night of brisk sales. “They ar­rive even be­fore us,” com­mented 28-year-old pro­tester Ploy at a protest by tens of thou­sands of peo­ple yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Meat­ball seller Rat­tapol Sukpa said he stays ahead of the curve by mon­i­tor­ing Face­book for hints of the lat­est lo­ca­tions, and is in con­stant con­tact with other ven­dors who tip one an­other off.</p>
    <p>“My earn­ings were good be­fore, but sell­ing at the protest sites, you’d sell out faster than usual,” the 19-year-old said as he set up near Vic­tory Mon­u­ment.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness has been boom­ing since the protest move­ment kicked off in July, with ven­dors now a reg­u­lar fea­ture on the side­lines. A post call­ing on peo­ple to rally at a new protest venue on Tues­day car­ried a pic­ture of a food cart with the cap­tion, “Let’s send the CIA there first”.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers are call­ing for se­ri­ous changes to Thai­land’s sta­tus quo – an over­haul of Mr Prayut’s ad­min­is­tra­tion, a rewrit­ing of the mil­i­tary-scripted Con­sti­tu­tion and re­forms to the king­dom’s monar­chy.</p>
    <p>But their gath­er­ings also bring a food fes­ti­val vibe. Sour pork and rice sausage balls, a del­i­cacy of Thai­land’s north-east prov­inces, hang like beaded neck­laces from a street ven­dor’s push­cart, ready to be fried up and served with cab­bage in plas­tic bags. Also on the menu are hot­dogs, soups, cold drinks, pick­led fruits and sa­tay.</p>
    <p>As his chicken thigh por­tions siz­zle in a fry­ing pan, Mr Nat­tapol Sai-ngarm said he is con­scious of the risks of do­ing busi­ness in such a dicey en­vi­ron­ment. But the econ­omy’s freefall in the face of a coro­n­avirus pan­demic has left him with­out a choice. “I used to be scared” of a po­lice crack­down, he said. “But I’ve been com­ing ev­ery day so I’ve got­ten used to it.”</p>
