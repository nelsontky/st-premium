    <p>•</p>
    <p>PRI­VAS (France) Ineos Gre­nadiers, whose pre­vi­ous it­er­a­tion Team Sky won seven of the last eight edi­tions of the Tour de France, no longer have the same air of in­vin­ci­bil­ity here.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the man­ager of ri­val team EF Pro Cy­cling, Jonathan Vaugh­ters, there is a new player in town in Jumbo-Visma.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with Eurosport and GCN yes­ter­day, the head of the Amer­i­can team claimed “Ineos are off their game”, adding: “They’re not what they have been in the past years.”</p>
    <p>His as­ser­tion was re­in­forced yes­ter­day as Jumbo’s Wout van Aert won the fifth stage of the Tour, in what was a 183km ride from Gap, with no break­away, an al­most un­prece­dented sce­nario in normal rac­ing con­di­tions in the mod­ern era.</p>
    <p>Dutch­man Cees Bol of Team Sun­web was sec­ond and De­ce­un­inck–Quick-Step’s Sam Bennett took third place to be­come the first Ir­ish­man to wear the green jersey for the points clas­si­fi­ca­tion since</p>
    <p>Sean Kelly in 1990.</p>
    <p>Bel­gian van Aert said: “It was a heavy fin­ish, it was the eas­i­est stage I’ve ever done in a cy­cling race be­fore be­cause there was no break­away and it was not a high pace. But then ev­ery­one was fresh in the last hour, it was high pace and high winds.</p>
    <p>“I knew it was a stage that suited me and just so happy I got the op­por­tu­nity from the team to go for it. I have my stage win and from now on I will sup­port the team even more.”</p>
    <p>France’s Ju­lian Alaphilipp­e of Bel­gian team De­ce­un­inck–Quick-Step re­ceived a 20-sec­ond penalty for il­le­gal feed­ing, hand­ing the yel­low jersey to Bri­tain’s Adam Yates of Aus­tralian out­fit Mitchel­ton-Scott.</p>
    <p>Jumbo-Visma leader and favourite Pri­moz Roglic of Slove­nia is three sec­onds be­hind Yates in sec­ond. And with Dutch team­mate Tom Du­moulin in sixth and trail­ing Yates by 13 sec­onds, Vaugh­ters has been im­pressed by the Dutch out­fit, who “have shown their strength early”.</p>
