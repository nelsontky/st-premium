    <p>US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den ap­pears set to nom­i­nate for­mer mil­i­tary gen­eral Lloyd Austin as Sec­re­tary of De­fence.</p>
    <p>If con­firmed, Gen­eral Austin, who as Cen­tral Com­mand (Cent­com) head ran mil­i­tary op­er­a­tions in the Mid­dle East un­der pres­i­dent Barack Obama, would be the first African Amer­i­can de­fence chief.</p>
    <p>But he would re­quire a Con­gres­sional waiver to be con­firmed, as he has been re­tired for only four years. There is a man­dated sev­enyear “cool­ing off” pe­riod be­fore a for­mer mil­i­tary of­fi­cer can take the post, de­signed to en­sure civil­ian con­trol of the mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>This is a key is­sue. Such waivers have only been granted twice – in 1950 for Gen­eral Ge­orge Mar­shall, who was Army chief of staff dur­ing World War II; and in 2017, for re­tired Gen­eral James Mat­tis.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ten­ure raised eye­brows over his re­la­tion­ship with the mil­i­tary. Mr Trump has al­ter­nately praised and dis­par­aged gen­er­als.</p>
    <p>Most fa­mously, on June 1, po­lice cleared pro­test­ers out­side the White House with tear gas so that Mr Trump could have his photo taken hold­ing up a Bi­ble out­side a church, with chair­man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen­eral Mark Mil­ley, by his side.</p>
    <p>Gen Mil­ley later said: “I should not have been there. My pres­ence in that mo­ment and in that en­vi­ron­ment cre­ated a per­cep­tion of the mil­i­tary in­volved in do­mes­tic pol­i­tics.”</p>
    <p>Gen Austin cer­tainly has solid mil­i­tary cre­den­tials. He was the first African Amer­i­can gen­eral of­fi­cer to com­mand a di­vi­sion and a corps in com­bat, and the first African Amer­i­can to com­mand an en­tire theatre of war, in Iraq. He was also the first African Amer­i­can to serve as the vice-chief of staff of the army and Cent­com.</p>
    <p>But the ques­tion will be raised as to whether it is nec­es­sary to have a for­mer gen­eral run­ning the Depart­ment of De­fence.</p>
    <p>For­eign Pol­icy yes­ter­day quoted an un­named for­mer de­fence of­fi­cial in the Ge­orge W. Bush and Obama ad­min­is­tra­tions as say­ing: “The Demo­cratic field should be proud of the huge bench of di­verse civil­ian lead­er­ship it can field at all lev­els. What made it nec­es­sary to turn to a re­tired gen­eral?”</p>
    <p>Sev­eral me­dia out­lets, quot­ing un­named sources, had re­ported Mr Bi­den’s choice of Gen Austin, though as of yes­ter­day morn­ing in Washington, the of­fi­cial an­nounce­ment had not been made.</p>
    <p>In nom­i­nat­ing him, Mr Bi­den passed on Ms Michele Flournoy, who as a for­mer deputy as­sis­tant sec­re­tary of de­fence in the Bill Clin­ton ad­min­is­tra­tion, and co­founder of the think-tank Cen­tre for a New Amer­i­can Se­cu­rity, was con­sid­ered a front run­ner, and would have been the first woman in the post.</p>
    <p>She was, how­ever, not par­tic­u­larly favoured by Demo­cratic Party pro­gres­sives who see her as a hawk – and also want more diver­sity in Mr Bi­den’s team. The left wing of the party had con­cerns over Ms Flournoy’s role in US mil­i­tary in­ter­ven­tions in Libya and the Mid­dle East, as well as her ties to the de­fence in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Code­pink, the women’s anti-war group, tweeted on Mon­day: “Vic­tory! Tremen­dous grat­i­tude to the over 2,500 in­di­vid­u­als who took ac­tion and con­tacted the Se­nate to block Flournoy’s ap­point­ment. Get ready, Gen Austin, we’re com­ing for you.”</p>
    <p>A third con­tender for the post, for­mer Home­land Se­cu­rity sec­re­tary Jeh John­son, also an African Amer­i­can, seems to be out of the run­ning as well.</p>
    <p>Gen Austin has served in a range of elite units and was the 3rd In­fantry Di­vi­sion’s as­sis­tant di­vi­sion com­man­der for ma­noeu­vre dur­ing the 2003 in­va­sion of Iraq. As com­man­der of Cent­com, he was cer­tainly a fa­mil­iar fig­ure to Mr Bi­den be­fore re­tir­ing as a four-star gen­eral in 2016.</p>
    <p>But his post-mil­i­tary ca­reer, in which he has been on the board of di­rec­tors of Raytheon, maker of weapons (in­clud­ing smart bombs), will also un­doubt­edly come un­der scru­tiny.</p>
    <p>Raytheon has been prof­it­ing from arms sales to Saudi Ara­bia and re­port­edly could clinch a US$23 bil­lion (S$30.7 bil­lion) weapons deal with the United Arab Emi­rates if it is passed by Congress.</p>

If con&#xAD;firmed, Gen&#xAD;eral Austin, who as Cen&#xAD;tral Com&#xAD;mand head ran mil&#xAD;i&#xAD;tary op&#xAD;er&#xAD;a&#xAD;tions in the Mid&#xAD;dle East un&#xAD;der pres&#xAD;i&#xAD;dent Barack Obama, would be the first African Amer&#xAD;i&#xAD;can de&#xAD;fence chief.</p>
