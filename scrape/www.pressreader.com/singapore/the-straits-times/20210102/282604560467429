    <p>RIO DE JANEIRO • Ney­mar laughed off con­tro­versy on Thurs­day over re­ports that he was throw­ing a mega New Year’s party for 500 guests, post­ing a video on­line of prepa­ra­tions for what he called a “low-key din­ner” with fam­ily and friends.</p>
    <p>The su­per­star foot­baller has faced a flood of crit­i­cism in his na­tive Brazil and be­yond over re­ports that, de­spite the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, he was ring­ing in 2021 with a week-long bash for hun­dreds of peo­ple at his man­sion out­side Rio de Janeiro.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he took to In­sta­gram sev­eral hours be­fore mid­night to show his New Year’s Eve plans, which he de­scribed as small-scale.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old Paris Saint-Ger­main striker posted a video of a din­ner ta­ble that ap­peared to be for about 40 guests, decked out with white flow­ers and an empty chair be­tween each place set­ting.</p>
    <p>“Mar­vel­lous dec­o­ra­tion for this beau­ti­ful, low-key lit­tle din­ner at home, with so­cial dis­tanc­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>“And it’s not for 500 peo­ple, ok?” he added with a laugh.</p>
    <p>“So­cial dis­tanc­ing. Ev­ery­one tested,” he wrote in a cap­tion.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, he posted videos of him­self and his nine-year-old son get­ting what he called his “50th test” for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Ney­mar, who has not played since in­jur­ing his an­kle against Lyon on Dec 13, had pre­vi­ously avoided com­ment­ing on re­ports about his sup­posed party in the sea­side town of Man­garat­iba, which is around 105km from Rio.</p>
    <p>Rio de Janeiro state pros­e­cu­tors have opened an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the re­ports.</p>
    <p>They said Ney­mar de­nied on Thurs­day host­ing any party in Man­garat­iba, ac­cord­ing to news site G1.</p>
    <p>The foot­baller has re­port­edly trav­elled to Santa Cata­rina state in south­ern Brazil to ring in the New Year there.</p>
    <p>His press of­fice did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to ques­tions on his plans.</p>
    <p>Brazil, with a pop­u­la­tion of 212 mil­lion, has the se­cond-high­est death toll in the pan­demic, af­ter the United States, with nearly 195,000 peo­ple killed by Covid-19.</p>
