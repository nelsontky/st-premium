    <p>China sent two air force jets which briefly crossed the me­dian line in the Tai­wan Strait, shortly be­fore United States health chief Alex Azar met Tai­wan’s Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen yes­ter­day, said Tai­wan’s air force.</p>
    <p>Sec­re­tary of Health and Hu­man Ser­vices Azar, the high­est-rank­ing US Cab­i­net of­fi­cial to visit Tai­wan since 1979, when the two sides ended for­mal diplo­matic ties, yes­ter­day hailed Tai­wan’s “demo­cratic suc­cess story, and a force for good in the world”. He also praised Ms Tsai’s han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, in a meet­ing cer­tain to raise ten­sions be­tween Bei­jing and Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>China, which sees Tai­wan as a break­away prov­ince to be re­uni­fied by force if nec­es­sary, has al­ways res­o­lutely op­posed of­fi­cial ex­changes be­tween any coun­try and Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>In the high­est-level of­fi­cial meet­ing be­tween Tai­wan and the US in four decades, Ms Tsai be­gan the ses­sion by ex­press­ing her grat­i­tude towards US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo and Mr Azar for “their con­tin­ued recog­ni­tion of the Tai­wan model’s con­tri­bu­tion to global anti-pan­demic ef­forts, as well as their strong sup­port for Tai­wan’s in­ter­na­tional par­tic­i­pa­tion”.</p>
    <p>She also said she ex­pects no­table progress on the joint col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween Tai­wan and the US in de­vel­op­ing Covid-19 vac­cines.</p>
    <p>In his open­ing re­marks at the meet­ing, Mr Azar ap­peared to have mis­pro­nounced Ms Tsai’s name – say­ing some­thing which sounded closer to “shee”, which is the sur­name of Mr Xi Jin­ping, China’s Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>De­spite Mr Azar get­ting the pro­nun­ci­a­tion cor­rect a few sen­tences later, Tai­wan’s main opposition party, the Kuom­intang, ex­pressed dis­ap­proval and called for the Pres­i­den­tial Of­fice to de­mand an ex­pla­na­tion from the vis­it­ing en­voy.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­den­tial Of­fice is­sued a re­sponse later in the after­noon, say­ing that af­ter clar­i­fy­ing with Mr Azar’s team, it was a mere pro­nun­ci­a­tion is­sue, and that Mr Azar was un­doubt­edly ad­dress­ing Ms Tsai.</p>
    <p>Mr Azar, who ar­rived in Tai­wan on Sun­day, said the first theme of his visit was to “recog­nise Tai­wan as an open and demo­cratic so­ci­ety, ex­e­cut­ing a highly suc­cess­ful and trans­par­ent Covid-19 re­sponse”.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond and third are re­spec­tively to “reaf­firm Tai­wan as a long­stand­ing part­ner and friend of the United States”, and to “note that Tai­wan de­serves to be recog­nised as a global health leader with an ex­cel­lent track record of con­tribut­ing to in­ter­na­tional health”.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day after­noon, Mr Azar also met Tai­wan’s Health Min­is­ter Chen Shih-chung, who heads the is­land’s main Covid-19 re­sponse depart­ment, the Cen­tral Epi­demic Com­mand Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan and the US yes­ter­day signed their first mem­o­ran­dum of un­der­stand­ing (MOU) on health co­op­er­a­tion to ex­pand co­op­er­a­tion on global health se­cu­rity, in­fec­tious disease con­trol and vaccine de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>The US had con­demned Tai­wan’s ex­clu­sion from the World Health As­sem­bly in May, crit­i­cis­ing China’s “spite­ful ac­tion to si­lence Tai­wan”.</p>
    <p>“In light of fur­ther ag­gres­sion from the (Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China), Tai­wan does ben­e­fit from these types of sym­bolic acts, even if no con­crete changes will come in the form of pol­icy,” Mr Lev Nach­man, a Ful­bright Re­search Fel­low and PhD can­di­date in po­lit­i­cal science from the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, Irvine, who fo­cuses on Tai­wanese pol­i­tics, said yes­ter­day, re­fer­ring to the MOU and Mr Azar’s visit.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian said at a reg­u­lar press brief­ing in Bei­jing yes­ter­day that the US should abide by the one-China prin­ci­ple, un­der which the US recog­nises and has for­mal ties with China rather than Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>“What the US has done se­ri­ously vi­o­lates its com­mit­ments on the Tai­wan is­sue,” said Mr Zhao, who urged the US to “han­dle Tai­wan-re­lated is­sues care­fully and prop­erly to pre­vent harm­ing co­op­er­a­tion in im­por­tant ar­eas be­tween China and the United States, and harm­ing the peace and sta­bil­ity of the Tai­wan Strait”.</p>
    <p>China flew J-11 and J-10 fighter air­craft briefly onto Tai­wan’s side at around 9am, Tai­wan’s air force said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese air­craft, the air force said, were tracked by Tai­wan’s land-based anti-air­craft mis­siles and were “driven out” by patrolling Tai­wanese air­craft.</p>
