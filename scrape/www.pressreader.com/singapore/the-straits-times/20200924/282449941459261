    <p>Twelve years ago, ac­tor Liam Nee­son’s ca­reer took a new di­rec­tion when the thriller Taken (2008) was re­leased.</p>
    <p>The story of a fu­ri­ous fa­ther with a “par­tic­u­lar set of skills” – to quote from his char­ac­ter’s di­a­logue – was a global phe­nom­e­non. It would spawn two se­quels – in 2012 and 2014.</p>
    <p>Af­ter that, the ac­tor, who had been syn­ony­mous with di­rec­tor Steven Spiel­berg’s Os­car-win­ning Holo­caust biopic Schindler’s List (1993), was re­born as an ac­tion hero. He was in his mid-50s.</p>
    <p>Now 68, he says he was “very lucky” to have found the Taken films at that stage of his life. Put­ting in the work to make the punches look real still gives him a thrill.</p>
    <p>“I love hang­ing out with stunt guys. Hav­ing fight re­hearsals – that makes me feel like a kid in a candy store,” he tells The Straits Times in a Zoom in­ter­view from his home in New York state.</p>
    <p>Made In Italy, a gen­tle dra­ma­com­edy that stars the ac­tor from North­ern Ire­land, forms the part of his out­put that gains less at­ten­tion than his ac­tion-ori­ented work.</p>
    <p>The film opens to­day in cin­e­mas. “It’s nice to mix it up and it’s great to get the chance to do that,” says Nee­son of his out­put, which can range from Si­lence (2016), a re­li­gious drama di­rected by Martin Scors­ese, to Or­di­nary Love (2019), a ten­der story of a cou­ple han­dling the woman’s di­ag­no­sis of breast can­cer.</p>
    <p>In the com­ing months, Nee­son goes back to flex­ing his mus­cles in two thrillers – Hon­est Thief, due this year, and The Ice Road, out next year.</p>
    <p>In Made In Italy, he is Robert, an artist and fa­ther to Jack, an art gallery man­ager played by Nee­son’s real son, Micheal Richard­son. The pair are in Tus­cany and, over the course of sev­eral weeks, as they re­pair a home left to them by Robert’s dead wife, un­healed frac­tures in their re­la­tion­ship come to the sur­face.</p>
    <p>In other in­ter­views, Richard­son has talked about how the film’s themes of grief, es­trange­ment and heal­ing mir­ror real events in his and his fa­ther’s life. His mother and Nee­son’s wife, English ac­tress Natasha Richard­son, died at age 45 from a head in­jury in a ski­ing ac­ci­dent in Canada in 2009.</p>
    <p>English ac­tor James D’Arcy (war drama Dunkirk, 2017; and su­per­hero tele­vi­sion se­ries Agent Carter, 2015 and 2016) had com­pleted the screen­play be­fore the ac­ci­dent and was said to be filled with trep­i­da­tion when he gave it to Nee­son.</p>
    <p>D’Arcy also makes his fea­ture di­rect­ing de­but with the pro­ject, a fact that does not de­ter Nee­son nor cause him to be­have any dif­fer­ently on set.</p>
    <p>“I don’t have a pol­icy for work­ing with first-time di­rec­tors. I’m cer­tainly very ner­vous be­cause the difference be­tween act­ing and di­rect­ing is huge. But I know James, he’s a very fine ac­tor and he’s writ­ten a beau­ti­ful script of which I am very fond.</p>
    <p>“So I trusted James. I was thrilled when we were able to cast my son. I knew it was go­ing to be a joy and in­deed it was,” he says of the ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>It is not the first time that fa­ther and son are in a film to­gether. The younger man had a sup­port­ing part in the ac­tion movie Cold Pur­suit (2019), in which he also played the son of Nee­son’s cen­tral char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>In Made In Italy, as fa­ther and son come clean with each other, the story moves from com­edy to tragedy and back again. Nee­son says he en­joys projects that call on him to ex­press this sort of wide emo­tional palette, but only if it is or­ganic to the story.</p>
    <p>“It’s nice to have a range of emo­tions that you can play with. It’s good to get your teeth around some­thing and just go for it, man.”</p>
