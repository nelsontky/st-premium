    <p>Fol­low­ing a marathon 12-hour de­bate stretch­ing over two days and a lengthy ex­change on whether to adopt a min­i­mum wage, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat yes­ter­day set out two things in his round-up speech about the Gov­ern­ment’s strat­egy to emerge stronger from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>First, the broader and unique con­text of the pol­icy choices that Sin­ga­pore must make. Sec­ond, how these choices af­fect what lies ahead for work­ers, busi­nesses, so­ci­ety and fis­cal pol­icy.</p>
    <p>On the first point, he noted that Sin­ga­pore, un­like many other coun­tries, is both a city and a nation. Therein lies the ten­sion be­tween re­main­ing open to peo­ple and ideas, and pre­serv­ing a com­mu­nity that shares a com­mon iden­tity and des­tiny.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore is a city – open to new and ex­cit­ing flows,” he said. “But we are also a nation – we have to make a liv­ing for our­selves, stay united and de­fend our in­de­pen­dence.”</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment must con­tinue to uplift its peo­ple, but this is no “straight­for­ward mat­ter”, he added. Also, com­pa­nies here are di­verse and num­ber sev­eral hun­dred thou­sand.</p>
    <p>The list of sup­port mea­sures de­bated is too long to re­peat here, but a few points bear not­ing.</p>
    <p>First, Mr Heng was sup­port­ive of the sug­ges­tion by Mr Mu­rali Pil­lai (Bukit Ba­tok) to ex­tend the 50 per cent Jobs Growth In­cen­tive (JGI) wage sup­port to former of­fend­ers.</p>
    <p>Un­der the JGI, com­pa­nies re­ceive up to 50 per cent of the salary of each new lo­cal hire aged 40 and above. This was re­cently ex­tended to per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties, re­gard­less of age.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio GRC) asked if the JGI could be­come a long-term pol­icy – one that is cou­pled with state help to up­skill work­ers.</p>
    <p>To en­cour­age the hir­ing of lo­cals and their move­ment into growth sec­tors, Mr Leon Per­era (Alju­nied GRC) pro­posed fixed-term work passes for for­eign­ers, and a re­dun­dancy in­sur­ance scheme where ad­di­tional in­come sup­port is tied to reskilling.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment, said Mr Heng, is also study­ing how to con­tinue sup­port­ing self-em­ployed per­sons be­yond this year, when the Self-Em­ployed Per­son</p>
    <p>In­come Re­lief Scheme ends.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion loom­ing over all of these is how the Gov­ern­ment will re­plen­ish its cof­fers, given that it is draw­ing up to $52 bil­lion from past re­serves to fund the sup­port pack­ages.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Pan­jang) on how the Gov­ern­ment would bal­ance its Bud­get, Mr Heng ac­knowl­edged that global eco­nomic growth is likely to be lack­lus­tre for a few years, and global com­pe­ti­tion for tax rev­enues could in­ten­sify.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment had been look­ing to bor­row for ma­jor long-term in­fra­struc­ture even be­fore Covid-19 struck, he said.</p>
    <p>“This will help to spread out the hefty up­front costs eq­ui­tably across cur­rent and fu­ture gen­er­a­tions who will ben­e­fit from such in­vest­ments.”</p>
    <p>He as­sured Sin­ga­pore­ans that the Gov­ern­ment will not bor­row just to make up for rev­enue short­falls, or be op­por­tunis­tic in tim­ing the market.</p>
    <p>But for re­cur­rent spend­ing such as health­care and ed­u­ca­tion that ben­e­fits cur­rent gen­er­a­tions, he said that the re­spon­si­ble way is to pay for them us­ing re­cur­rent rev­enues such as taxes.</p>
    <p>De­tails on the tim­ing of the goods and ser­vices tax (GST) hike were not forth­com­ing, but this is not en­tirely un­ex­pected given the fluid eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“We will... (take) into ac­count the pace of our eco­nomic re­cov­ery, our rev­enue out­look and how much spend­ing we can de­fer to later years with­out jeop­ar­dis­ing our long-term needs,” he ex­plained.</p>
    <p>On Progress Sin­ga­pore Party NCMP Leong Mun Wai’s sug­ges­tion to shelve the GST rate in­crease in­def­i­nitely, Mr Heng had this to say: “Over 60 per cent of the net GST borne by all in­di­vid­u­als and house­holds is from for­eign­ers re­sid­ing in Sin­ga­pore, tourists and the top 20 per cent of res­i­dent house­holds.</p>
    <p>“Mr Leong’s sug­ges­tion... means that we will lose the ad­di­tional rev­enues from these groups which we can use to im­prove the lives of Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
    <p>It is hard to quar­rel with the un­prece­dented level of gov­ern­ment sup­port given since the be­gin­ning of this year.</p>
    <p>Oc­ca­sional glitches aside, gov­ern­ment agen­cies have moved with ad­mirable speed, lit­er­ally fine-tun­ing schemes by the week or month.</p>
    <p>Yet, some Sin­ga­pore­ans will in­evitably be left out, and both real and per­ceived in­equal­i­ties will con­tinue to grow.</p>
    <p>When it was re­vealed in the House yes­ter­day that the in­come of work­ers in the 10th per­centile now stands at $1,517 com­pared with $1,000 10 years ago, how many Sin­ga­pore­ans would – hand on heart – say they would be happy with a to­tal salary hike of $517 over a decade?</p>
    <p>Is it enough to make the low­est-in­come feel that they are march­ing in lock­step with fel­low Sin­ga­pore­ans?</p>
    <p>Even as the cir­cuit breaker hit those in low-wage jobs dis­pro­por­tion­ately, low in­ter­est rates have buoyed as­set prices and sparked a prop­erty-buy­ing frenzy among the well-off.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment faces a deeply dif­fi­cult eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal land­scape go­ing for­ward, and as Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong GRC) said yes­ter­day, there is a need to main­tain hope in so­ci­ety and in peo­ple’s hearts.</p>
    <p>One hopes that fol­low­ing the work of the Emerg­ing Stronger Task Force, and with ideas gath­ered from the Emerg­ing Stronger Con­ver­sa­tions, Sin­ga­pore­ans will have some­thing to rally around – be it a project, a rein­vig­o­rated set of pol­icy prin­ci­ples or na­tional vi­sion.</p>
    <p>But un­til then, Mr Heng has the un­en­vi­able task of man­ag­ing ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>As long as Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to ex­ist, the ques­tion is not whether there will be an ex­ter­nally in­duced cri­sis, but when, he said, adding: “In the medium to longer term, our ap­proach is to adapt and find new ways to gen­er­ate growth. We must work hard to get our­selves back in a po­si­tion where our econ­omy is grow­ing and we can build up re­serves for the fu­ture again.</p>
    <p>“This is the sus­tain­able and pru­dent way for­ward.”</p>
    <p>One hopes that fol­low­ing the work of the Emerg­ing Stronger Task Force, and with ideas gath­ered from the Emerg­ing Stronger Con­ver­sa­tions, Sin­ga­pore­ans will have some­thing to rally around – be it a project, a rein­vig­o­rated set of pol­icy prin­ci­ples or na­tional vi­sion.</p>
    <p>But un­til then, DPM Heng (Swee Keat) has the un­en­vi­able task of man­ag­ing ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
