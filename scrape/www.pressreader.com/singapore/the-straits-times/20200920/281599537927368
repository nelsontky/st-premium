    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from two cases two weeks ago to one in the past week. The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained stable at one case a day in the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>Hil­lion Mall in Pe­tir Road and the Han­iffa store in Lit­tle In­dia’s Dun­lop Street were vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were in­fec­tious, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The two lo­ca­tions were added to a list of places vis­ited by com­mu­nity cases dur­ing their in­fec­tious pe­riod. The mall was vis­ited on Sept 15 and the store was vis­ited on Sept 7.</p>
    <p>The MOH pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes and the times at which they vis­ited them so that peo­ple who were at those places at the same time can mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on MOH’s web­site.</p>
    <p>The min­istry has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and that there is no need to avoid th­ese places, as they would have been cleaned if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>There were 15 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing five im­ported cases who ar­rived from Iran and In­dia be­tween Sept 6 and 15.</p>
    <p>The sole new com­mu­nity case is a 22-year-old Sin­ga­porean man who is cur­rently un­linked to other cases.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing nine cases are for­eign work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries, of whom six were iden­ti­fied ear­lier as con­tacts of pre­vi­ous cases and had been quar­an­tined. The other three were de­tected through sur­veil­lance test­ing, such as ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>This takes Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal cases to 57,558.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from two cases two weeks ago to one in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained stable at one case a day in the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>With 71 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,127 have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease. A to­tal of 27 pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal, while 362 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. None is in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
