    <p>Oper­a­tionally ready na­tional ser­vice­men (NS­men) were called up last month for home­land se­cu­rity op­er­a­tions for the first time since March 31, when all non-es­sen­tial in-camp train­ing was de­ferred be­cause of the Covid-19 out­break. About 580 NS­men from the 735th Bat­tal­ion Sin­ga­pore Guards were de­ployed.</p>
    <p>Oper­a­tionally ready na­tional ser­vice­men (NS­men) were called up for home­land se­cu­rity op­er­a­tions for the first time since March 31, when all non-es­sen­tial in-camp train­ing was de­ferred be­cause of the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>About 580 NS­men from the 735th Bat­tal­ion Sin­ga­pore Guards (735 GDS) re­turned last month, with about 440 of them de­ployed to pro­tect key in­stal­la­tions at Jurong Is­land and the re­main­ing men serv­ing in sup­port­ing roles.</p>
    <p>The NS­men re­ported for their two-week in-camp train­ing in two batches. Half of them started early last month, and the oth­ers be­gan in the sec­ond half of the month.</p>
    <p>Their pre-de­ploy­ment train­ing in­cluded re­fresher courses on searc­hand-ar­rest tech­niques and en­gag­ing hos­tile in­di­vid­u­als, as well as fir­ing ex­er­cises.</p>
    <p>Var­i­ous safe man­age­ment mea­sures – such as hav­ing the ser­vice­men un­dergo travel and health dec­la­ra­tions be­fore en­ter­ing the camp and twice-daily tem­per­a­ture tak­ing – were in place dur­ing the in-camp train­ing pe­riod.</p>
    <p>A stag­gered train­ing pro­gramme was also im­ple­mented to pre­vent large groups of sol­diers from con­gre­gat­ing, said Third War­rant Of­fi­cer Ja­cob Lim, 31, a com­pany sergeant ma­jor in 735 GDS.</p>
    <p>The NS­men de­ployed at Jurong Is­land were seg­re­gated ac­cord­ing to whether they were on duty or on standby for se­cu­rity in­ci­dents, he added.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, NS­men as­signed for du­ties at Jurong Is­land had to pass a swab test for Covid-19 be­fore they were de­ployed.</p>
    <p>Lieu­tenant-Colonel (NS) Mark Chew, the unit’s com­mand­ing of­fi­cer, said that the pres­ence of safe man­age­ment mea­sures re­sulted in var­i­ous memorable sit­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>This in­cluded see­ing ser­vice­men wear masks when they got up from their beds to use the wash­room in the mid­dle of the night, the 39-year-old said.</p>
    <p>“The habit of wear­ing a mask is al­ready in­grained in them,” he added.</p>
    <p>Cor­po­ral First Class (NS) Muralithar­an Kalaivanan, 31, who at­tended the in-camp train­ing in the sec­ond half of last month, said that he and his fel­low ser­vice­men had been look­ing for­ward to re­turn­ing for re­servist du­ties.</p>
    <p>“It is only once a year that we see one an­other and train to­gether,” he said.</p>
