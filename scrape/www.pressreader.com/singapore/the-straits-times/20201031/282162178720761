    <p>The de­bate over whether the Govern­ment should in­tro­duce a min­i­mum wage for work­ers is good for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>It will fo­cus minds on how best to help the poor­est-paid work­ers earn more to im­prove their liv­ing standards.</p>
    <p>Even more heart­en­ing, from the dis­cus­sions so far, there is agree­ment all round they de­serve more. This is a step for­ward and it has taken the coun­try some time to get to this point.</p>
    <p>In its early years of devel­op­ment, it was taboo to talk about set­ting a floor on wages when the em­pha­sis was on job cre­ation and at­tract­ing for­eign com­pa­nies to set up shop here to take ad­van­tage of cheap labour. The hope was that as Sin­ga­pore made rapid progress, the ris­ing eco­nomic tide will lift many out of poverty.</p>
    <p>But it soon be­came clear that wages of low-end work­ers would not rise enough, es­pe­cially when the coun­try opened its doors to large num­bers of mi­grant work­ers pre­pared to work for barely sub­sis­tence wages.</p>
    <p>If you were a cleaner, con­struc­tion or fac­tory worker, your wage de­pended more on what sim­i­lar work­ers in emerg­ing coun­tries earned. But you had to pay Sin­ga­pore’s cost of liv­ing with your Third World salary.</p>
    <p>It was a dou­ble whammy for those at the bot­tom.</p>
    <p>At the top end, the se­lec­tive open­ing up of the coun­try to man­age­rial and pro­fes­sional staff had the op­po­site ef­fect, rais­ing the in­comes of those in th­ese pro­fes­sions to First World lev­els.</p>
    <p>If you hired a CEO from the United States and had to pay him top salary to at­tract him here, the pay of other se­nior staff in the com­pany would in­vari­ably go up, sooner or later.</p>
    <p>There is a halo ef­fect on pay scales at the top.</p>
    <p>But the of­fice cleaner and se­cu­rity guard are un­likely to ben­e­fit from the froth gen­er­ated by the cream at the top.</p>
    <p>Un­der the cir­cum­stances, it was not sur­pris­ing the in­come gap widened, and has be­come the press­ing po­lit­i­cal is­sue it is to­day.</p>
    <p>MIN­I­MUM WAGE VER­SUS PRO­GRES­SIVE WAGE</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment and its sup­port­ers who are op­posed to the min­i­mum wage ar­gue that it will lead to un­em­ploy­ment as busi­nesses that can’t af­ford to pay will shed work­ers, and may even be forced to close down. This will hurt small busi­nesses more than the big cor­po­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>They pre­fer the pro­gres­sive wage model (PWM) which is a sec­toral min­i­mum wage scheme tied to pro­duc­tiv­ity im­prove­ments and which has been im­ple­mented in the clean­ing, se­cu­rity and land­scape busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>In­tro­duced in 2012, the scheme now cov­ers 80,000 work­ers or 15 per cent of those at the bot­tom of the work­force.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics say it takes too long to be im­ple­mented as it in­volves de­tailed dis­cus­sions among em­ploy­ers, work­ers and the Govern­ment.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment’s other scheme is Work­fare but this of­fers lim­ited help as it ap­plies only to work­ers above 35 years old and the pay­out is small. For ex­am­ple, a 35-year-old earn­ing $1,000 a month will</p>
    <p>re­ceive a sup­ple­ment of only $54 in cash and $81 in the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF), mak­ing for a to­tal well short of the $1,300 needed to pay for ba­sic needs.</p>
    <p>Both sides have mounted cred­i­ble ar­gu­ments but since the Govern­ment drives pol­icy, it can hold its ground and in­sist on the sta­tus quo.</p>
    <p>So, end of dis­cus­sion?</p>
    <p>This might be the Govern­ment’s pre­rog­a­tive, but it is un­sat­is­fac­tory as it leaves tens of thou­sands of work­ers with barely sub­sis­tence wages for years to come.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Dr Koh Poh Koon, deputy sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the Na­tional Trades Union Congress, there are 32,000 full-time work­ers earn­ing less than $1,300 a month.</p>
    <p>How can so many work­ers be left with a sub­stan­dard life while the PWM is be­ing rolled out, which may take years?</p>
    <p>If the Govern­ment in­sists on keep­ing the PWM and rejects a na­tional min­i­mum wage, it should take steps now to en­sure th­ese work­ers are taken care of.</p>
    <p>First, a study should be un­der­taken to find out who th­ese work­ers are, what jobs they do, whether they are sole bread­win­ners, and what are their fam­ily cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>From the in­for­ma­tion gath­ered, it will be clearer who needs help</p>
    <p>the most.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment should then in­tro­duce a new in­come sup­ple­ment scheme to raise the wages of th­ese work­ers to $1,300, as­sum­ing this is the agreed min­i­mum thresh­old.</p>
    <p>This help should con­tinue un­til the PWM is im­ple­mented in all</p>
    <p>sec­tors of the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>But it should not stop here.</p>
    <p>RE­TIRE­MENT SE­CU­RITY</p>
    <p>Low earn­ings af­fect not just present-day liv­ing standards but the re­tire­ment se­cu­rity of th­ese work­ers. If noth­ing is done, they will be in se­ri­ous trou­ble in their re­tire­ment years and the prob­lem will re­bound on the Govern­ment of the day.</p>
    <p>They need help now to build up their re­tire­ment sav­ings to the min­i­mum level with reg­u­lar CPF top-ups. In fact, bet­ter still, have the top-ups early in their work­ing life so as to help them pay for a three-room HDB flat.</p>
    <p>This is im­por­tant be­cause prop­erty is an­other way to se­cure re­tire­ment se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>If the Govern­ment im­ple­ments the above sug­ges­tions, it will strengthen its case against the min­i­mum wage with a so­lu­tion that of­fers both im­me­di­ate and long-term reme­dies – an in­come sup­ple­ment fol­lowed by the PWM.</p>
    <p>As for tim­ing, the Covid-19 pan­demic might not be the best time to im­ple­ment th­ese mea­sures as the fo­cus should be on sav­ing jobs but plan­ning for them can start now so they can be in­tro­duced as soon as cir­cum­stances per­mit.</p>
    <p>HOW TO PAY FOR IT</p>
    <p>Th­ese pro­pos­als will cost the Govern­ment and might even lead it to dip fur­ther into its cof­fers.</p>
    <p>Can Sin­ga­pore af­ford it? If Sin­ga­pore­ans be­lieve it is morally right to help the poor­est among us who are not shirk­ers but work full time, some for 30 to 40 years, but earn barely enough for ba­sic needs, a way can be found to fund th­ese schemes.</p>
    <p>One sug­ges­tion: Col­lect more through tax­ing the rich, and es­pe­cially the su­per rich.</p>
    <p>If you are a bil­lion­aire, Sin­ga­pore is the best place in the world to be: In­come tax rates are among the low­est in the world, and there is no wealth or cap­i­tal gains tax, apart from prop­erty tax. Yet they en­joy a safe, stable and law-abid­ing en­vi­ron­ment, and First World ur­ban ameni­ties and ser­vices.</p>
    <p>There is room to make them con­trib­ute more with­out driv­ing them away.</p>
    <p>In fact, it is good for their own long-term in­ter­est and they will feel even more wel­come here.</p>
    <p>Low earn­ings af­fect not just present-day liv­ing standards but the re­tire­ment se­cu­rity of th­ese work­ers. If noth­ing is done, they will be in se­ri­ous trou­ble in their re­tire­ment years and the prob­lem will re­bound on the Govern­ment of the day.</p>
    <p>They need help now to build up their re­tire­ment sav­ings to the min­i­mum level with reg­u­lar CPF top-ups. In fact, bet­ter still, have the top-ups early in their work­ing life so as to help them pay for a three-room HDB flat.</p>
