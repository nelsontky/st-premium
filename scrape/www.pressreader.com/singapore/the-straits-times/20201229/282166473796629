    <p>The hype around Cy­ber­punk 2077 had been build­ing for nearly a decade. When CD Pro­jekt Red, the Pol­ish stu­dio be­hind the video game, an­nounced the ti­tle in 2012, it was billed as a grip­ping, freeflow­ing saga that would im­merse play­ers in a life­like sci-fi uni­verse.</p>
    <p>Since then, fans have been treated to im­pres­sive teaser trail­ers; there has been buy-in from celebri­ties such as Keanu Reeves, Grimes and A$AP Rocky; and head­lines have her­alded it as the most an­tic­i­pated ti­tle of the year, if not the cen­tury.</p>
    <p>The game is set in a dystopian fu­ture in which dig­i­tal no­mads nav­i­gate a high-stakes world of cor­po­rate es­pi­onage (with Reeves as their guide) and aug­ment their bod­ies with high-tech weaponry.</p>
    <p>Play­ers, es­pe­cially those us­ing next-gen­er­a­tion con­soles from Sony and Mi­crosoft, were promised a revo­lu­tion­ary ex­pe­ri­ence, with ex­ten­sive char­ac­ter cus­tomi­sa­tion op­tions and an ex­pan­sive world to ex­plore. Eight mil­lion peo­ple pre­ordered copies, sight un­seen, ahead of its re­lease this month.</p>
    <p>In July 2018, as an­tic­i­pa­tion for the game neared a crescendo across Twit­ter, one user tweeted on the of­fi­cial Cy­ber­punk 2077 ac­count: “Will there be memes in the game?” The ac­count re­sponded: “Whole game is go­ing to be a meme.” The tweet was some­what pre­scient – but not in the way de­vel­op­ers had hoped.</p>
    <p>Since the re­lease of Cy­ber­punk 2077 on Dec 10, thou­sands of gamers have cre­ated vi­ral videos fea­tur­ing a mul­ti­tude of glitches and bugs – many hi­lar­i­ous – that mar the game. They in­clude tiny trees cov­er­ing the floors of build­ings, tanks fall­ing from the sky and char­ac­ters stand­ing up, in­ex­pli­ca­bly pant­less, while rid­ing mo­tor­cy­cles.</p>
    <p>These videos de­pict a game that is vir­tu­ally un­playable: rife with er­rors, pop­u­lated by char­ac­ters run­ning on barely func­tional ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, and largely in­com­pat­i­ble with the older gam­ing con­soles meant to sup­port it. Fans are livid.</p>
    <p>So many gamers de­manded re­funds from distrib­u­tors last week that they over­whelmed Sony’s cus­tomer ser­vice rep­re­sen­ta­tives and even briefly took down one of its cor­po­rate sites.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Sony and Mi­crosoft said they would of­fer full re­funds to any­one who pur­chased Cy­ber­punk 2077 through their on­line stores; Sony even pulled the ti­tle.</p>
    <p>Cy­ber­punk’s roll-out is one of the most vis­i­ble dis­as­ters in the his­tory of video games – a high-pro­file flame-out in the midst of the hol­i­day shop­ping sea­son by a stu­dio widely con­sid­ered an in­dus­try dar­ling. It shows the pit­falls gam­ing stu­dios can face when build­ing so­called triple-A games, ti­tles backed by years of de­vel­op­ment and hun</p>
    <p>dreds of mil­lions of dol­lars.</p>
    <p>But it is also a tale that in­sid­ers said they saw com­ing for months, based on CD Pro­jekt Red’s his­tory of game de­vel­op­ment and warning signs that the game might not live up to its sky-high ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>THE VIEW FROM WAR­SAW</p>
    <p>CD Pro­jekt Red was founded in War­saw, Poland, in the 1990s, by high-school friends Marcin Iwin­ski and Michal Kicin­ski, dur­ing a time of growth in the gam­ing in­dus­try. The two be­gan im­port­ing games from the United States and es­sen­tially repack­ag­ing and re­pub­lish­ing them in Poland.</p>
    <p>Early em­ploy­ees, who spoke on con­di­tion of anonymity, de­scribed the com­pany’s lead­ers as deft mar­keters, sto­ry­tellers and artis­tic vi­sion­ar­ies. Their en­thu­si­asm for their games of­ten ran ahead of</p>
    <p>their engi­neer­ing and tech­ni­cal prow­ess, the em­ploy­ees said.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s am­bi­tions were as­tro­nom­i­cal early on, as were some of its fail­ures.</p>
    <p>In the early 2000s, CD Pro­jekt Red made a play to de­velop The Witcher, a pop­u­lar se­ries of books by Pol­ish writer An­drzej Sap­kowski, into an im­mer­sive video game fran­chise. But the first Witcher game, re­leased in 2007, was buggy and stuffed with more fea­tures than it could sup­port. For­mer em­ploy­ees who worked on the game said it would take three to five min­utes to load ba­sic screens.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ees said that dur­ing game de­vel­op­ment, there was a gen­eral at­ti­tude of build­ing more things them­selves rather than li­cens­ing sup­port­ing soft­ware from other com­pa­nies with greater ex­per­tise.</p>
    <p>Still, the Witcher se­ries gained the stu­dio an early fol­low­ing and fan base. The stu­dio re­ceived the most ac­claim for The Witcher 3, which won awards for its de­tailed uni­verse and rich sto­ry­telling.</p>
    <p>Like ear­lier ti­tles, it was buggy from the out­set, frus­trat­ing play­ers. But most fans ac­cepted what they saw as CD Pro­jekt Red’s will­ing­ness to put out projects that were not yet prob­lem-free.</p>
    <p>Then came Cy­ber­punk 2077. An­nounced in 2012 and based loosely on a table­top role-play­ing game cre­ated in 1988, the ti­tle was CD Pro­jekt Red’s first at­tempt at cre­at­ing a new, fu­tur­is­tic world.</p>
    <p>It was to be set in Night City, a darkly dystopian megac­ity where hu­mans and ma­chines were fused to­gether and repack­aged as mer­ce­nar­ies, car­ry­ing out sab­o­tage mis­sions against evil cor­po­ra­tions. The game would com­bine el­e­ments from some of sci-fi’s great­est hits: Strange Days meets Blade Run­ner meshed with The Ma­trix.</p>
    <p>To ham­mer that point home, CD Pro­jekt Red cast a fa­mil­iar fa­mous face in the game: Reeves.</p>
    <p>“Let me tell you, the feel­ing of be­ing there, of walk­ing the streets of the fu­ture, is re­ally go­ing to be breath­tak­ing,” Reeves said at a de­vel­op­ment con­fer­ence last year.</p>
    <p>DE­LAYS, RE­FUNDS</p>
    <p>In­side CD Pro­jekt Red, it was a very dif­fer­ent story. De­vel­op­ers were con­cerned with some of the grand prom­ises be­ing made by man­age­ment on the pro­mo­tional mar­ket­ing tour. Far into the game’s de­vel­op­ment, for­mer em­ploy­ees said, the hy­per-cus­tomis­able and end­lessly ex­plorable world be­ing sold to play­ers was nowhere close to man­i­fest­ing.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, CD Pro­jekt Red tweeted that the game’s re­lease had been de­layed un­til Sept 17. Then, in March, the coro­n­avirus pan­demic caused the stu­dio to send its work­force home.</p>
    <p>Though the com­pany said re­mote work would not hurt Cy­ber­punk’s chances of a Septem­ber re­lease, ex­ec­u­tives even­tu­ally an­nounced fur­ther de­lays. The date was pushed to Nov 19 to “fix a lot of bugs”. It was the same story in Oc­to­ber, when the re­lease was pushed to Dec 10.</p>
    <p>While de­vel­op­ers had cre­ated a func­tion­ing game for PC users, Cy­ber­punk was gl­itchy and crashed fre­quently on next-gen­er­a­tion con­soles like the PlayS­ta­tion 5 and the new Xbox de­vices. Even worse, the game barely ran on older con­soles like PlayS­ta­tion 4 and Xbox One.</p>
    <p>Mr Billy Marte, an ac­count ex­ec­u­tive at a soft­ware com­pany in Austin, Texas, said: “There was so much there, but they just didn’t pay at­ten­tion to the de­tails... It’s ev­i­dent that this game was rushed.”</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, Sony said it would re­fund play­ers who wanted to return the game, and the com­pany pulled Cy­ber­punk from its dig­i­tal shopfront. The next day, Mi­crosoft said it would is­sue re­funds, but it did not re­move the game from its on­line store. CD Pro­jekt Red said that day that it would re­fund dis­ap­pointed play­ers “out of our own pocket if nec­es­sary”.</p>
    <p>The com­ing weeks will de­ter­mine whether CD Pro­jekt Red can make good on a prom­ise it made back in 2017, when play­ers won­dered whether the ti­tle would ever come out. “Worry not,” it tweeted, as­sur­ing fans that Cy­ber­punk 2077 would be “huge” and “sto­ry­driven”. “No hid­den catch, you get what you pay for.”</p>
