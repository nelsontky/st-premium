    <p>On Sept 30, 2005, the Dan­ish news­pa­per Jyl­lands-Posten pub­lished 12 ed­i­to­rial car­toons. Most of the car­toons de­picted Prophet Muham­mad. The news­pa­per stated that it was an at­tempt to con­trib­ute to the de­bate about crit­i­cism of Is­lam and against self-cen­sor­ship.</p>
    <p>When the car­toons were pub­lished, Mus­lims in Den­mark protested, and the protest was taken up by Mus­lim com­mu­ni­ties all over the world.</p>
    <p>Some of the protests be­came vi­o­lent and led to the death of 250 in­di­vid­u­als. Saudi Ara­bia, Kuwait and other coun­tries in the</p>
    <p>Middle East, or­gan­ised a boy­cott of Dan­ish prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>CHAR­LIE HEBDO</p>
    <p>On Nov 2, 2011, the French satir­i­cal weekly news­pa­per Char­lie Hebdo pub­lished an is­sue with the Prophet as the al­leged guest edi­tor. A day after its pub­li­ca­tion, the premises of the news­pa­per were fire­bombed.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber 2012, the same news­pa­per pub­lished a se­ries of car­toons of the Prophet, in very bad taste. Speak­ing at the United Na­tions soon after the pub­li­ca­tion of the car­toons, then US Pres­i­dent Barack Obama said: “The fu­ture must not be­long to those who slan­der the prophet of Is­lam. But to be cred­i­ble, those who con­demn that slan­der must also con­demn the hate we see in the images of Je­sus Christ that are des­e­crated, or churches that are de­stroyed, or the Holo­caust that is de­nied.”</p>
    <p>On Jan 7, 2015, two gun­men forced their way into the premises of Char­lie Hebdo. They opened fire and killed 12 mem­bers of the staff. The world re­acted in hor­ror to this out­rage. Many of the lead­ers of the world, in­clud­ing those from Mus­lim coun­tries, joined then</p>
    <p>French Pres­i­dent Fran­cois Hol­lande in a pub­lic dis­play of sol­i­dar­ity.</p>
    <p>SA­MUEL PATY</p>
    <p>Mr Sa­muel Paty was a French school teacher. He taught at a ju­nior high school in a com­mune called Con­flans-Sainte-Hon­orine, not far from Paris. Early last month, Mr Paty was teach­ing a class on freedom of ex­pres­sion. He showed his stu­dents two car­toons of Prophet Muham­mad from Char­lie Hebdo. Some of his stu­dents and their par­ents were un­happy with his ac­tion.</p>
    <p>On Oct 16, an 18-year-old Mus­lim im­mi­grant from Rus­sia, Ab­doul­lakh Abouyezi­dovitch An­zorov, went to Mr Paty’s school. He asked a num­ber of the stu­dents to iden­tify Mr Paty. He fol­lowed him, killed him with a knife and de­cap­i­tated him. An­zorov was shot dead by the po­lice.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the in­ci­dent, in an Oct 2 speech against “Is­lamist</p>
    <p>sep­a­ratism”, Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron de­scribed Is­lam as a re­li­gion that is cur­rently in cri­sis. On Oct 21, at a na­tional me­mo­rial in hon­our of Mr Paty, at which the Le­gion of Hon­our was con­ferred posthu­mously on the slain teacher, Mr Macron said France would not dis­avow the car­toons.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, car­toons of the Prophet from Char­lie Hebdo were also dis­played on some pub­lic build­ings in two cities in the south of France.</p>
    <p>On Oct 31, in re­sponse to crit­i­cisms about his re­marks, Mr Macron gave an in­ter­view to Al Jazeera to em­pha­sise that there is no stig­ma­ti­sa­tion of Is­lam in France, al­though the gov­ern­ment has the duty to up­hold French val­ues of freedom of ex­pres­sion. He also pub­lished an op-ed in the Fi­nan­cial Times on Nov 4 to make sim­i­lar points.</p>
    <p>On Nov 2, a teacher at a high school in Rot­ter­dam in the Nether­lands went into hid­ing after</p>
    <p>re­ceiv­ing threats fol­low­ing a class­room dis­cus­sion on the killing of Mr Paty.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the dis­cus­sion, some stu­dents took of­fence over a satir­i­cal car­toon hang­ing in the class­room, and a photo of the im­age be­gan cir­cu­lat­ing on so­cial me­dia within a day. A young woman has been ar­rested on sus­pi­cion of in­cit­ing threats.</p>
    <p>There was a sim­i­lar in­ci­dent at an­other school in Den Bosch on Nov 5 and the teacher in­volved was also sub­jected to threats. Dutch Prime Min­is­ter Mark Rutte has called the threats to the teach­ers “ab­surd” and “in­tol­er­a­ble”.</p>
    <p>THE CEN­TRAL QUES­TION</p>
    <p>Al­most all the coun­tries of the world, in­clud­ing Mus­lim coun­tries, have con­demned the killing of Mr Paty.</p>
    <p>At the same time, many thought­ful per­sons out­side Europe have ap­pealed to Den­mark,</p>
    <p>France, the Nether­lands and other Euro­pean coun­tries to re­frain from in­sult­ing Is­lam and its Prophet.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral ques­tion is whether freedom of speech in­cludes the right to slan­der Is­lam or any other re­li­gion.</p>
    <p>THE SECULARISA­TION OF WEST­ERN EUROPE</p>
    <p>Over the past 50 years, Chris­tian­ity has been on the de­cline in North­ern and West­ern Europe. In a May 2018 re­port by the Pew Re­search Cen­tre, it was stated that the ma­jor­ity of Euro­pean Chris­tians were non-prac­tis­ing. West­ern Europe has be­come one of the world’s most sec­u­lar re­gions.</p>
    <p>The re­port also found that only a mi­nor­ity, about 22 per cent, of Europe’s Chris­tians at­tended monthly church ser­vices. In ev­ery coun­try, ex­cept Italy, non-prac­tis­ing Chris­tians out­num­bered those who at­tended church reg­u­larly.</p>
    <p>The secularisa­tion of West­ern Europe may ex­plain why Euro­peans see noth­ing wrong in mock­ing the Prophet of Is­lam and nam­ing bars and restau­rants after Lord Bud­dha. Euro­peans must un­der­stand that while West­ern Europe has be­come less re­li­gious, this is not the case in other parts of the world.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, there is in­creas­ing re­li­gios­ity among Mus­lims. Is­lam is the fastest grow­ing re­li­gion in the world. At present, Is­lam has</p>
    <p>1.9 bil­lion ad­her­ents, ac­count­ing for 24.9 per cent of the world’s pop­u­la­tion. Chris­tian­ity has 2.4 bil­lion ad­her­ents, or 31 per cent of the world’s pop­u­la­tion. Is­lam is pro­jected to over­take Chris­tian­ity as the big­gest re­li­gion of the world after reach­ing par­ity by 2070, ac­cord­ing to Pew Re­search Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>LIM­ITS TO FREEDOM OF SPEECH</p>
    <p>Freedom of speech is an im­por­tant hu­man right. It is pro­tected by the United Na­tions’ Uni­ver­sal Dec­la­ra­tion of Hu­man Rights and the In­ter­na­tional Covenant on Civil and Po­lit­i­cal Rights.</p>
    <p>All le­gal sys­tems, how­ever, recog­nise cer­tain lim­its to freedom of speech, such as defama­tion, per­jury, in­cite­ment to vi­o­lence, pornog­ra­phy, ob­scen­ity, sedi­tion and blas­phemy.</p>
    <p>In 16 Euro­pean coun­tries, in­clud­ing France, the de­nial of the Holo­caust is not pro­tected by free speech. The Holo­caust led to the death of six mil­lion Jews. To deny that this tragedy had hap­pened is deeply of­fen­sive to Jews across the world. For this rea­son, the de­nial of the Holo­caust is made a crime in those coun­tries. This is laud­able.</p>
    <p>EUROPE AND THE WORLD</p>
    <p>Both Asia and Europe do not ex­ist in iso­la­tion. We are part of the world and we want to live in har­mony with the rest of the world. In or­der to do so, both Asia and Europe must con­sider the feel­ings of the other re­gions and coun­tries of the world.</p>
    <p>We live in a very di­verse world. We have peo­ples of dif­fer­ent races, re­li­gions, lan­guages, cul­tures and ide­olo­gies. We live on the same planet and we must learn to live at peace with one an­other. For this to hap­pen, we must show tol­er­ance and re­spect for the faiths of oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Re­li­gion seems to be less im­por­tant to many West­ern Euro­peans; it is, how­ever, very im­por­tant to the fol­low­ers of many re­li­gions, in­clud­ing</p>
    <p>Is­lam. In Sin­ga­pore, we value re­li­gious har­mony.</p>
    <p>AP­PEAL TO EUROPE</p>
    <p>In or­der to pre­serve that har­mony, we show re­spect for all re­li­gions, even if we are ir­re­li­gious. Your freedom of speech must not vi­o­late my freedom not to have my re­li­gion satirised or mocked.</p>
    <p>I make this sin­cere ap­peal to my Euro­pean friends to re­con­sider the wis­dom of re­cent ac­tions which might be mis­con­strued as dis­re­spect for Is­lam and its Prophet.</p>
