    <p>A gym at a com­mu­nity club has closed down un­ex­pect­edly, leav­ing its mem­bers – some of whom had re­cently signed up for mem­ber­ships – high and dry.</p>
    <p>En­er­gym 24/7, a pri­vate fa­cil­ity at Bukit Timah Com­mu­nity Club, ter­mi­nated its ten­ancy on July 21, said the com­mu­nity club in a no­tice posted out­side its shut­tered doors.</p>
    <p>The note said that the gym – which had been op­er­at­ing there since De­cem­ber 2015 and had been closed since the cir­cuit breaker started on April 7 – “is one of our ten­ants and we are not in­volved in their op­er­a­tions”, adding that it was owed monthly rental and util­ity/ser­vice charges.</p>
    <p>Gym mem­ber Scott Wong, 29, told The Straits Times: “For many months, other mem­bers and I were still wait­ing for the gym to re­open, and the owner was quite re­spon­sive on Face­book, telling us to look out for updates.”</p>
    <p>The former na­tional ath­lete had just re­newed his 18-month mem­ber­ship in Fe­bru­ary for $600 and used to visit the gym four times a week.</p>
    <p>An­other mem­ber, who de­clined to be named, said the gym’s owner was ini­tially re­spon­sive on Face­book and What­sApp, but his replies be­came spo­radic and its Face­book page has been taken down.</p>
    <p>The en­gi­neer said: “We’re frus­trated be­cause he’s not giv­ing us any updates. I just want some of my money back.”</p>
    <p>The owner – whom Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Author­ity records show is one Teng Kok Wah, known as Jer­rick to mem­bers – de­clined to com­ment when con­tacted.</p>
    <p>The Bukit Timah Com­mu­nity Club man­age­ment com­mit­tee said it is seek­ing the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion head­quar­ters’ guid­ance on the is­sue.</p>
    <p>The Con­sumers As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore re­ceived five com­plaints in the past two months about the sud­den clo­sure of En­er­gym. Its ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Loy York Jiun warned that ob­tain­ing a refund when a busi­ness is in­sol­vent can be chal­leng­ing, ad­vis­ing con­sumers to choose the “pay as you use” op­tion in­stead.</p>
