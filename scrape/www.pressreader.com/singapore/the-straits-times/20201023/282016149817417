    <p>Min­i­mum wage, gen­der equal­ity and party lead­er­ship suc­ces­sion were the main hot-but­ton is­sues that came up dur­ing an on­line di­a­logue yes­ter­day in­volv­ing rep­re­sen­ta­tives from three po­lit­i­cal par­ties.</p>
    <p>The on­line fo­rum, on the par­ties’ assess­ment of the 2020 Gen­eral Elec­tion and their agenda for the next few years, was or­gan­ised by the In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies (IPS).</p>
    <p>At the event on IPS’ Face­book page, mod­er­ated by the in­sti­tute’s se­nior re­search fel­low, Dr Gil­lian</p>
    <p>Koh, the panel­lists re­sponded to ques­tions raised by the au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>MIN­I­MUM WAGE</p>
    <p>When asked if there is a con­sen­sus in the Work­ers’ Party (WP) on how soon Sin­ga­pore should im­ple­ment a min­i­mum wage, Sengkang GRC MP Louis Chua said the party is keen to do it “right now”.</p>
    <p>The WP does not see min­i­mum wage and Sin­ga­pore’s pro­gres­sive wage model (PWM) as di­a­met­ri­cally op­posed, he added.</p>
    <p>“It’s about peo­ple hav­ing to feed their fam­i­lies at this point in time, and not hav­ing to wait for (the PWM) to be rolled out to their par­tic­u­lar sec­tor.”</p>
    <p>The PWM – a frame­work where work­ers can earn higher salaries as they up­grade their skills – has been the sub­ject of ro­bust de­bate in Par­lia­ment. The WP is push­ing for full­time Sin­ga­porean work­ers to be paid a min­i­mum of $1,300 a month.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to the WP’s pro­posal i n Par­lia­ment l ast week, deputy labour chief Koh Poh Koon dis­closed that about 32,000 full­time work­ers in Sin­ga­pore – or 1.7 per cent of the lo­cal work­force – take home less than $1,300 each month.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary for Health Ra­hayu Mahzam re­it­er­ated Dr Koh’s point, not­ing at the fo­rum that this is a small num­ber and the PWM is ef­fec­tively a min­i­mum wage plus.</p>
    <p>“We have to come to a point where</p>
    <p>we do not just keep push­ing the ide­ol­ogy, but look at how it works in a par­tic­u­lar con­text,” she said.</p>
    <p>The Progress Sin­ga­pore Party (PSP) is also against the WP pro­posal.</p>
    <p>Its as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Francis Yuen said wages are just one part of over­all busi­ness costs, and the key is to raise pro­duc­tiv­ity and re­duce over-reliance on for­eign work­ers. “It should not be a sys­tem where for­eign work­ers are</p>
    <p>brought cheap.”</p>
    <p>in be­cause</p>
    <p>GEN­DER EQUAL­ITY</p>
    <p>they are</p>
    <p>On the gen­der pay gap, Ms Ra­hayu said re­solv­ing it does not boil down to just in­tro­duc­ing leg­is­la­tion. It also re­quires in­sight into the dy­nam­ics of the work­place.</p>
    <p>“We’re talk­ing about chang­ing mind­sets and look­ing at how work can be made more flex­i­ble. It’s about pro­duc­tiv­ity and what one can de­liver,” she added, ac­knowl­edg­ing that some women pay a “moth­er­hood penalty” for tak­ing time off from work to care for chil­dren.</p>
    <p>A Man­power Min­istry study found that women here earned 6 per cent less than their male peers in 2018, after tak­ing into ac­count fac­tors such as the worker’s in­dus­try, oc­cu­pa­tion, age and ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Chua noted that some multi­na­tional com­pa­nies give moth­ers and fa­thers the same num­ber of days of ma­ter­nity and pa­ter­nity leave.</p>
    <p>Fa­thers in Sin­ga­pore are en­ti­tled to two weeks of paid pa­ter­nity leave.</p>
    <p>“Per­haps this is some­thing we can do more of,” he said. “It’s not just about wages, but en­sur­ing that there is equal­ity across some of these other di­men­sions as well.”</p>
    <p>LEAD­ER­SHIP SUC­CES­SION AND CAN­DI­DATE SE­LEC­TION</p>
    <p>On whether the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party would re­fine its process for se­lect­ing elec­toral can­di­dates, Ms Ra­hayu pointed out that its can­di­date slate this year re­flected a di­ver­sity of back­grounds, ex­pe­ri­ences, age groups and gen­ders.</p>
    <p>Al­lud­ing to Mr Ivan Lim, who with­drew his can­di­dacy in GE2020 after al­le­ga­tions were made about his con­duct, she said: “We re­alise that for who­ever we put up, there’s a de­gree of vul­ner­a­bil­ity that they are ex­posed to. But I would call for a lot more value to be placed on what the can­di­date can of­fer.”</p>
    <p>Mr Chua said WP chief Pri­tam Singh’s new role as Leader of the Op­po­si­tion is some­thing the party will build on. “It also gives Sin­ga­pore the op­por­tu­nity to in­sti­tu­tion­alise an op­po­si­tion in Par­lia­ment and in our po­lit­i­cal sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>On whether the PSP is more than just its party chief Tan Cheng Bock, Mr Yuen stressed that the party is groom­ing new tal­ent.</p>
    <p>“The plan is not to have just one per­son suc­ceed­ing Dr Tan but a group of peo­ple,” he said, adding that the pres­ence in Par­lia­ment of Non-Con­stituency MPs Hazel Poa and Leong Mun Wai, both from the PSP, will help es­tab­lish the party’s brand.</p>
    <p>Ms Ra­hayu said the Govern­ment needs to not only tackle the im­me­di­ate is­sues fac­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, such as jobs and liveli­hoods, but to also ac­knowl­edge peo­ple’s hopes and as­pi­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>“We need to keep lis­ten­ing to, and ac­com­mo­date, this grow­ing de­sire for di­ver­sity of views, while strength­en­ing the com­mon cause and what holds us to­gether as Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
