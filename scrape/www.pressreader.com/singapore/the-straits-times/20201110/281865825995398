    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong prodemoc­racy leg­is­la­tors threat­ened mass res­ig­na­tions yes­ter­day, amid re­ports that Bei­jing plans to dis­qual­ify four op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers who have been ac­cused by the rul­ing camp of fil­i­bus­ter­ing in the leg­is­la­ture.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier yes­ter­day, lo­cal news site HK01 re­ported, cit­ing un­named sources, that Bei­jing might make the move later this week in the lat­est squeeze on op­po­si­tion politi­cians in the for­mer Bri­tish colony.</p>
    <p>The four have been ac­cused by pro-Bei­jing politi­cians of fil­i­bus­ter­ing to ob­struct leg­is­la­tion. Some pro-Bei­jing law­mak­ers said that it may be con­trary to the oath of of­fice.</p>
    <p>The re­port did not de­tail a spe­cific in­ci­dent or in­ci­dents of al­leged at­tempt to ob­struct leg­is­la­tion, nor say what le­gal mech­a­nism Bei­jing would use to dis­qual­ify them.</p>
    <p>“We would like to use the mass res­ig­na­tion, on the one hand, to re­flect our unity and, on the other hand, to re­flect the tyranny of the cen­tral gov­ern­ment and the HKSAR,” said Mr Wu Chi Wai, chair­man of the Demo­cratic Party, us­ing the city’s of­fi­cial name, the Hong Kong Spe­cial Ad­min­is­tra­tive Re­gion.</p>
    <p>The pro-democ­racy camp has 19 seats in the 70-seat leg­is­la­ture.</p>
    <p>The spec­u­la­tion comes a week af­ter eight prom­i­nent op­po­si­tion politi­cians were ar­rested in con­nec­tion with a meet­ing in the Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil in May that de­scended into chaos.</p>
    <p>The four iden­ti­fied by HK01 as the ones be­ing con­sid­ered for dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion – Mr Alvin Ye­ung, Mr Den­nis Kwok, Mr Kwok Ka Ki and Mr Ken­neth Le­ung – were not among those eight.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the four were among 12 can­di­dates dis­qual­i­fied from run­ning for an elec­tion for the city’s leg­is­la­ture, ini­tially sched­uled for Septem­ber but post­poned for a year, with the au­thor­i­ties cit­ing coro­n­avirus risks. The terms of all law­mak­ers were ex­tended by a year.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties in Hong Kong and Bei­jing have moved swiftly to crack down on dis­sent in the fi­nan­cial hub af­ter anti-gov­ern­ment protests last year plunged the city into its big­gest cri­sis in decades.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics of the Hong Kong gov­ern­ment have ac­cused it of sti­fling free­doms in the city and slammed the post­pone­ment of the Septem­ber elec­tion in which the prodemoc­racy op­po­si­tion had hoped to make sig­nif­i­cant gains.</p>
    <p>The elec­tion would have been the first since Bei­jing im­posed a con­tro­ver­sial national se­cu­rity law on the city on June 30.</p>
