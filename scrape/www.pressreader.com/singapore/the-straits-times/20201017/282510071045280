    <p>Let’s face it, most five-seaters are re­ally four-seaters. Or at best, 41/ 2- seaters.</p>
    <p>It is a tight squeeze when there are three adults in the sec­ond row, with the per­son in the mid­dle hav­ing the worst deal.</p>
    <p>So, if you want a car­riage which ac­com­mo­dates five com­fort­ably on longer jour­neys, you need some­thing like the new Mazda CX-8.</p>
    <p>It comes with ei­ther six or seven seats. The six-seat op­tion is more com­fort­able, while the seven-seat vari­ant of­fers more flex­i­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Ei­ther one fer­ries a fam­ily of five with room to spare. And for the oc­ca­sional trip which in­volves grand­par­ents or do­mes­tic helpers, the CX-8 obliges too.</p>
    <p>Like the Mazda CX-9, the CX-8 is fash­ioned like a crossover. Boxy mul­ti­pur­pose ve­hi­cles (MPVs) are no longer in favour th­ese days, but cars with a hint of off-road rugged­ness are.</p>
    <p>The CX-8 is smaller than the enor­mous CX-9, but still a size­able ve­hi­cle at 4.9m long, 1.84m wide and al­most 1.73m tall. It has the same 2,930mm wheel­base as the CX-9, so there is am­ple room on board.</p>
    <p>Its en­gine has the same 2,488cc dis­place­ment as the CX-9’s, but is not tur­bocharged like the lat­ter. With a high com­pres­sion ra­tio typ­i­cal of Mazda’s Sky­Ac­tiv pow­er­trains, it makes 194hp and 258Nm of torque.</p>
    <p>That is not half bad, but with a kerb weight of 1.8 tonnes, the out­put does not ex­actly trans­late to zip­pi­ness. The cen­tury sprint is 10.7 sec­onds, top speed 196kmh and real-world fuel con­sump­tion 12.5 litres/100km on a good day (ver­sus Mazda’s stated 8.1 litres/100km).</p>
    <p>At the wheel, the car does not feel all that slug­gish.</p>
    <p>Its six-speed au­to­box does a de­cent job of bring­ing revs up quickly and keep­ing them within a us­able band. Then, the car’s steer­ing­mounted cruise con­trol but­tons al­low you to re­spond to changes in traf­fic flow if your foot tires of stomp­ing on the right pedal.</p>
    <p>So, per­for­mance-wise, it meets muster – not a siz­zler, but far from be­ing a sloth. And its well­tuned chas­sis and steer­ing help en­hance the driv­ing ex­pe­ri­ence. Ride com­fort is com­mend­able for its height and heft.</p>
    <p>The fuel con­sump­tion, how­ever, is some­what higher than ex­pected.</p>
    <p>In terms of ver­sa­til­ity, the CX-8 is a lot bet­ter than the Mazda 5 com­pact MPV, which is no longer avail­able here. Its size puts it on a higher pedestal, as does its col­lapsi­ble third row. The seats fold down eas­ily to re­veal a com­pletely flat cargo area.</p>
    <p>Even with­out flip­ping the last row down, the CX-8’s stowage – ac­ces­si­ble via a pow­ered tail­gate – is enough for a week’s gro­ceries. It will even ac­com­mo­date one full­size golf bag, thanks to deep re­cesses on ei­ther side.</p>
    <p>In terms of re­fine­ment, the CX-8 is also sig­nif­i­cantly bet­ter than the Mazda 5 and just a shade off the im­pec­ca­ble Mazda 3.</p>
    <p>The car is well equipped, with pre­mium fea­tures such as self-lock­ing doors, adap­tive LED head­lights, lane-keep­ing as­sist, 360-de­gree cam­era, brak­ing in­ter­ven­tion, head-up dis­play and at­ten­tion alert – all of which should keep each of its six or seven oc­cu­pants safe and sound.</p>
