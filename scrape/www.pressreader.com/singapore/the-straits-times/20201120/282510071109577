    <p>PASS IT ON</p>
    <p>Burn a can­dle, then turn the pot into a plant. Pass It On’s eco-friendly can­dles ($32) are de­signed with a green prod­uct life cy­cle.</p>
    <p>Each can­dle can be re­pur­posed as a planter and is housed in a por­ous pot that al­lows soil to breathe. Com­pressed soil pel­lets and biodegrad­able pa­per in­fused with wild­flower seeds are in­cluded.</p>
    <p>There are six scents, each pay­ing trib­ute to an iconic des­ti­na­tion that is un­der threat due to cli­mate change, such as Venice (rose and patchouli); and the brand’s best-sell­ing scent The Alps (a fresh blend of English pear and freesia), which is meant to trans­port you to Europe’s melt­ing glaciers.</p>
    <p>Avail­able at: pass-it-on.co</p>
    <p>BREATHE ES­SEN­TIALS CO</p>
    <p>Founder and breast cancer sur­vivor Char­lene Koh, 37, was in­spired to cre­ate an aro­mather­apy brand af­ter find­ing com­fort in es­sen­tial oils on her cancer jour­ney.</p>
    <p>She launched Breathe Es­sen­tials Co in Oc­to­ber, with a full line-up of or­ganic es­sen­tial oils (from $33), 300ml scented can­dles ($49) and yoga mat sprays ($34.90).</p>
    <p>Made of coco soy wax and us­ing wood wicks, the can­dles in­clude scents like Cookie Dough and Laven­der Fields – and are hand-poured by Ms Koh. Avail­able at: breatheess­en­tialsco.com</p>
    <p>MAI­SON 21G</p>
    <p>Just like its cus­tomis­able per­fumes, Mai­son 21G’s newly launched Dual Can­dle ($150) lets you cus­tomise your home fra­grance too.</p>
    <p>You can pur­chase the in­di­vid­ual cres­cent-shaped can­dle blocks ($75 for 270g) to com­bine and cre­ate your de­sired scent, or burn them alone. Buy two and the brand throws in for free a stylish brass-plated can­dle holder to bring ev­ery­thing to­gether.</p>
    <p>The eight scents avail­able are sage, raspberry, san­dal­wood, rose, am­ber, cedar, fig and vanilla.| Avail­able at: Mai­son 21G bou­tiques at 77 Duxon Road and Ion Or­chard, and at mai­son21g.com.</p>
    <p>A-KYN­DLE</p>
    <p>It is a game of chance with A-kyn­dle, by ac­ces­sories la­bel An­other Kynd, whose unique can­dles ($33.90 each) fea­ture a base of resin and dried flow­ers. Cus­tomers can choose from three scents – fresh, flo­ral and woody – and be­tween two cu­rated pe­tal bases be­fore the can­dles are cus­tom-made by hand. The scents and flow­ers are var­ied ev­ery week.</p>
    <p>A-kyn­dle uses nat­u­ral soy wax scented by fra­grance oils.</p>
    <p>Co-founder Ce­leste Ho says the can­dle jar can be up­cy­cled into a planter or ac­ces­sories holder af­ter burn­ing.</p>
    <p>Avail­able at: an­oth­erkynd.com/prod­uct/ cre­ate-your-own-kyn­dle/</p>
    <p>HUSH CAN­DLE</p>
    <p>This local soy can­dle brand founded in 2014 re­cently re­branded its pack­ag­ing and added four new scents: berg­amot clary sage; lemon­grass rose­mary; rose nut­meg; and ylang ylang clove (from $18 each).</p>
    <p>Along­side can­dles, the brand re­tails hand sani­tiser ($4) and room sprays ($18). Its new­est hol­i­day col­lec­tion fea­tures two lim­ited-edi­tion prod­ucts – the Cin­na­mon Nut­meg can­dle ($20) and Christ­mas Woods Room Spray ($20).</p>
    <p>Though Hush Can­dle started as a side hus­tle, founders Nicole Su and Chelsea Low left their day jobs about a year ago to run the company full time. Avail­able at: www.hush­can­dle.com</p>
    <p>AE­SOP</p>
    <p>Ae­sop’s first three Aro­ma­tique Can­dles ($155) were de­signed to be com­ple­men­tary, with com­mon notes that re­spond to one an­other and which ac­com­pany dif­fer­ent mo­ments of the day, says per­fumer Barn­abe Fil­lion, who de­vel­oped them.</p>
    <p>The gen­der-neu­tral scents are Agiance, a spicy flo­ral; Cal­li­pus, a woody fra­grance with notes of Frank­in­cense; and Ptolemy, an earthy blend of mossy woods.</p>
    <p>Mr Fil­lion was also be­hind Ae­sop’s Aro­ma­tique Room Sprays and per­sonal fra­grance Hwyl Eau de Par­fum. “We drew in­spi­ra­tion from one of the room sprays, while looking at how we could adapt the fra­grance pro­file for Hwyl to a new for­mat,” he says.</p>
    <p>“Like per­fume, home fra­grance is very per­sonal and is an ex­ten­sion of one’s per­son­al­ity.”</p>
    <p>Avail­able at: Ae­sop stores, in­clud­ing one at Ion Or­chard, and ae­sop.com</p>
    <p>The Town­house Col­lec­tion (above), com­pris­ing six new can­dles ($198 each for 300g), was de­signed specif­i­cally for the home and in­spired by the Jo Malone Lon­don Town­house built 200 years ago.</p>
    <p>Un­like the Bri­tish brand’s ex­ist­ing can­dles, which take af­ter its best-sell­ing cologne scents, this range fea­tures all-new scents.</p>
    <p>The six scents are in­spired by dif­fer­ent scenes in the home, such as by the fire­place (Glow­ing Embers) or fresh sheets on the bed (Lilac Laven­der & Lo­vage).</p>
    <p>Each is housed in a ce­ramic ves­sel ref­er­enc­ing the Georgian ar­chi­tec­ture of the Lon­don Town­house. Avail­able at: Jo Malone Lon­don bou­tiques in­clud­ing Ion Or­chard</p>
