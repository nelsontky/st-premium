    <p>As 2020 winds down, some par­ents may be think­ing of get­ting their child a smart­phone next year.</p>
    <p>But is your child ready to have his or her own mo­bile phone?</p>
    <p>There are no hard and fast rules re­gard­ing how old a child should be be­fore get­ting his or her first such de­vice.</p>
    <p>Ms Carol Loi, founder and prin­ci­pal con­sul­tant at Vil­lage Con­sul­tancy, a so­cial en­ter­prise that pro­vides ed­u­ca­tion on dig­i­tal lit­er­acy, lead­er­ship and fam­ily life, says: “There is no fixed rec­om­mended age, just as there is no fixed age as to when we in­tro­duce our chil­dren to us­ing knives or cross­ing the road in­de­pen­dently.</p>
    <p>“We watch to see when a child is de­vel­op­men­tally ready be­fore en­trust­ing him or her with a big re­spon­si­bil­ity.”</p>
    <p>She and other par­ent­ing ex­perts weigh in on how to gauge emo­tional readi­ness, as well as how to prepare kids to han­dle their first smart­phone. They sug­gest some ques­tions that par­ents should ask them­selves and guide­lines on phone us­age.</p>
    <p>1. Does the child re­spect rules?</p>
    <p>“Chil­dren who strug­gle with fol­low­ing rules in school or at home are not ready for the re­spon­si­bil­ity of a smart­phone,” says Ms Loi.</p>
    <p>“If they find it hard to stop when you ask them to stop play­ing on­line games, giv­ing them a smart­phone will make screen-time man­age­ment even harder.”</p>
    <p>2. How are the child’s so­cial skills?</p>
    <p>In­ter­ac­tions with oth­ers may de­cline fur­ther for a child with poor so­cial skills.</p>
    <p>Ms Loi says: “Chil­dren who have dif­fi­culty so­cial­is­ing in real life may have fewer op­por­tu­ni­ties to learn so­cial skills when they use their own smart­phone, at a time when they need to learn new in­ter­per­sonal skills to in­ter­act with oth­ers on­line.”</p>
    <p>3. How re­spon­si­ble is the child re­gard­ing his or her be­long­ings?</p>
    <p>Ms Loi adds that chil­dren who tend to lose their per­sonal items may find it dif­fi­cult to take care of an ex­pen­sive smart­phone.</p>
    <p>4. Have par­ents talked to their child about man­ag­ing dis­trac­tions?</p>
    <p>It is dif­fi­cult enough for adults to man­age screen time, let alone chil­dren, says Ms Loi.</p>
    <p>She says par­ents should help their chil­dren un­der­stand bound­aries are nec­es­sary to pre­vent them from be­ing overly dis­tracted on their de­vice.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily also needs to sup­port the child in nav­i­gat­ing such on­line temp­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>5. Have par­ents talked to their child about how to pro­tect him­self or her­self on­line?</p>
    <p>She says: “Chil­dren need to un­der­stand what are ap­pro­pri­ate photos, videos or links, so that they know what is ap­pro­pri­ate to post and how to deal with in­ap­pro­pri­ate con­tent. They also need to learn whom to trust on­line.”</p>
    <p>Par­ents should be the first to “pro­vide wis­dom” on deal­ing with top­ics such as ex­po­sure to cy­ber bul­ly­ing or pornog­ra­phy.</p>
    <p>“If you as­sess that your child is too young to dis­cuss sex­u­al­ity, then your child is not ready for the type of con­tent he or she will be see­ing,” she says.</p>
    <p>“When it comes to wit­ness­ing or ex­pe­ri­enc­ing cy­ber bul­ly­ing, nur­ture chil­dren to cul­ti­vate strong self-es­teem and en­cour­age them to be kind to them­selves and oth­ers.”</p>
    <p>6. Ad­dress needs, not wants</p>
    <p>If a child is ready for his or her first smart­phone, par­ents should “scaf­fold” the child’s ex­pe­ri­ence by start­ing small and set­ting tight bound­aries per­tain­ing to de­vice us­age, says Mr Shem Yao, head of Touch Par­ent­ing, Touch In­te­grated Fam­ily Group.</p>
    <p>These bound­aries can be slowly ex­panded when the child shows that he or she is trust­wor­thy and re­spon­si­ble, he adds.</p>
    <p>He sug­gests get­ting a ba­sic and af­ford­able first smart­phone.</p>
    <p>“You may also con­sider giv­ing your child a SIM card in­stead of a full mo­bile plan so what your child can do with the smart­phone is some­what lim­ited to ba­sic needs such as mak­ing calls and send­ing text mes­sages,” he says.</p>
    <p>7. Agree on a phone use con­tract</p>
    <p>Mr Yao rec­om­mends that par­ents set a phone use con­tract with their child.</p>
    <p>“It is im­por­tant to set bound­aries to­gether with your child so that it is clear to him or her what is or isn’t al­lowed.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, if your child has hit the amount of screen time stated in the con­tract, re­mind him or her of the mu­tu­ally agreed limit,” he says, adding that par­ents should also brief their off­spring on the var­i­ous phone fea­tures they will be us­ing.</p>
    <p>8. Be spe­cific</p>
    <p>Set­ting spe­cific rules is im­por­tant, es­pe­cially for a young child, be­cause such guide­lines “help the child to learn how to reg­u­late his or her smart­phone use and thus de­velop healthy habits”, says Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of psy­chol­ogy Yang Hwa­jin.</p>
    <p>She sug­gests be­ing clear with when, how and where the child can use his or her smart­phone.</p>
    <p>Par­ents should know why the child is us­ing the smart­phone, such as whether it is for gam­ing, surf­ing the In­ter­net, se­cur­ing trans­porta­tion like Grab, school work, class What­sApp chats, mu­sic or en­ter­tain­ment. Be clear what is for­bid­den such as dat­ing apps, she ad­vises.</p>
    <p>Par­ents should al­low the child to use the phone only at spe­cific times. For in­stance, smart­phones should not be al­lowed dur­ing meals, study time and bedtime.</p>
    <p>Even phys­i­cal spa­ces should be reg­u­lated, such as dis­al­low­ing phone use in a toi­let or in a locked room, she says.</p>
    <p>9. Mon­i­tor, mon­i­tor, mon­i­tor</p>
    <p>Young peo­ple can find their smart­phone an ir­re­sistible source of dis­trac­tion, says Dr Yang.</p>
    <p>She adds: “It’s im­por­tant to in­stall a mon­i­tor­ing app that lim­its a child’s screen time.”</p>
    <p>Mr Yao en­cour­ages par­ents of chil­dren in lower pri­mary school to make their kids ask per­mis­sion from them to use the smart­phone.</p>
    <p>“Par­ents should also have ac­cess to their chil­dren’s smart­phones at any time,” he adds.</p>
    <p>Par­ents should be vig­i­lant right up to the teen years.</p>
    <p>Mr Yao says: “Par­ents should al­ways mon­i­tor their child’s smart­phone use even till their child is in sec­ondary school.</p>
    <p>“Chil­dren, right up till ado­les­cence, are still in the midst of maturing and ex­plor­ing the dig­i­tal space. They are also still highly im­pres­sion­able.</p>
    <p>“It is cru­cial for par­ents to be aware of their chil­dren’s smart­phone us­age so that they can step in or in­ter­vene in a timely man­ner when nec­es­sary.”</p>
