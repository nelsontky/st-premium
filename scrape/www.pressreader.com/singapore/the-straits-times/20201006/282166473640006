    <p>In or­der to se­cure its tech­nol­ogy sys­tems and pre­vent data leaks, the Gov­ern­ment is work­ing on new ways to re­duce hu­man er­ror when man­ag­ing IT ac­cess for its of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>Chief among them are so­lu­tions be­ing de­vel­oped by the Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment Group (SNDGG) to au­to­mate the process of re­mov­ing and grant­ing ac­cess for of­fi­cers in the Gov­ern­ment’s more than 2,000 IT sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, the process re­quires ad­min­is­tra­tors to man­u­ally re­move or cre­ate ac­cess rights for of­fi­cers, said Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice In­dra­nee Ra­jah in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“The re­liance on man­ual ad­just­ments is prone to hu­man er­ror,” she added in re­sponse to a ques­tion from MP Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Pan­jang) about re­cur­ring lapses in IT con­trols that were high­lighted in both the lat­est and ear­lier Au­di­tor-Gen­eral’s re­ports.</p>
    <p>Im­ple­men­ta­tion of these new au­to­matic pro­cesses will take some time, given that there are var­i­ous steps that need to be re­tooled in each of the Gov­ern­ment’s dif­fer­ent IT sys­tems, many of which were in­tro­duced at dif­fer­ent points over the years, said Ms In­dra­nee.</p>
    <p>SNDGG is cur­rently pi­lot­ing soft­ware to au­to­mat­i­cally re­view the IT ac­cess of users and their ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>This soft­ware will be de­ployed pro­gres­sively from Jan­uary next year and will be fully im­ple­mented for high-pri­or­ity sys­tems by De­cem­ber 2022. It will then be in­stalled in all re­main­ing sys­tems by De­cem­ber the fol­low­ing year.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment is also au­tomat­ing the way such users’ ac­counts are man­aged, whereby an agency can be au­to­mat­i­cally alerted to stop a user from get­ting ac­cess to its IT sys­tems once he has left the agency.</p>
    <p>There are 38 agen­cies which have in­stalled this so­lu­tion, and Ms In­dra­nee said SNDGG is in the process of en­hanc­ing it so that it can au­to­mat­i­cally re­move un­needed user ac­counts once staff changes are up­dated in­ter­nally.</p>
    <p>This so­lu­tion will be im­ple­mented for 800 high-pri­or­ity sys­tems by De­cem­ber 2023 and all re­main­ing sys­tems by De­cem­ber 2024.</p>
    <p>Such an au­to­mated so­lu­tion will help staff in agen­cies bet­ter fo­cus on other as­pects of se­cu­rity in their IT sys­tems, said Ms In­dra­nee.</p>
    <p>“When of­fi­cers are freed up from man­ual tasks, they are bet­ter able to fo­cus on as­pects of cy­ber se­cu­rity and data pro­tec­tion that can­not be repli­cated by a ma­chine.”</p>
