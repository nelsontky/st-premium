    <p>LON­DON • The up­per cham­ber of Bri­tain’s Par­lia­ment has in­flicted a sym­bolic de­feat on the gov­ern­ment over Brexit leg­is­la­tion that crit­ics claim trashes the na­tion’s rep­u­ta­tion as a de­fender of the rule of law.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment’s in­ter­nal mar­ket Bill is de­signed to reg­u­late trade among the coun­try’s four con­stituent na­tions – Eng­land, Scot­land, Wales and North­ern Ire­land – af­ter Brexit.</p>
    <p>But it uni­lat­er­ally rewrites the di­vorce treaty that Bri­tain struck with the Euro­pean Union last year, spark­ing le­gal ac­tion from the 27-na­tion bloc.</p>
    <p>The Bill has al­ready passed the more pow­er­ful House of Com­mons but in the House of Lords, peers in­clud­ing Angli­can arch­bish­ops voted by a ma­jor­ity of 226 on Tues­day to ex­press their “re­gret” over its treaty-breach­ing pro­vi­sions.</p>
    <p>While the vote did not al­ter the Bill’s lan­guage, it sets the stage for de­tailed scru­tiny by the lords in the com­ing weeks. Many want to strip out those el­e­ments, trig­ger­ing a leg­isla­tive tus­sle with the Com­mons be­fore the Bill can be­come law.</p>
    <p>Mr Michael Howard, a for­mer leader of the rul­ing Con­ser­va­tive Party and a prom­i­nent Brex­i­teer, was among the dis­si­dent peers who voted for the mo­tion against the gov­ern­ment of Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son.</p>
    <p>“I want the United King­dom to be an i nde­pen­dent and sovereign state,” Mr Howard said dur­ing the de­bate. “But I want it to be an in­de­pen­dent sovereign state that holds its head up high in the world, that keeps its word, that up­holds the rule of law, that hon­ours its treaty obli­ga­tions.”</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment ar­gues the law is needed to pre­vent Bri­tain’s in­ter­nal mar­ket frag­ment­ing once the coun­try is free of EU rules in 2021, in par­tic­u­lar re­gard­ing North­ern Ire­land.</p>
    <p>But the ter­ri­tory is meant to en­joy a spe­cial post-Brexit sta­tus in con­sul­ta­tion with Brus­sels be­cause it shares a bor­der with EU mem­ber Ire­land.</p>
