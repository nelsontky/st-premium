    <p>An­other come­back vic­tory i n the books, Ser­ena Wil­liams waved to two of the very rare spec­ta­tors at this twi­light zone of a US Open: Her hus­band Alexis Oha­nian and their daugh­ter, Olympia, who turned three last week.</p>
    <p>“I hope she saw her mama fight­ing,” the for­mer world No. 1 said. “I don’t think she was pay­ing at­ten­tion. She may have been play­ing with some princesses up­stairs.”</p>
    <p>If so, Olympia missed the chance to watch the third seed force her tricky third-round match with Sloane Stephens into a U-turn on the strength of her serve and her will, pre­vail­ing 2-6, 6-2, 6-2 on Sat­ur­day.</p>
    <p>It was a sym­met­ri­cal score line, but an un­even and ul­ti­mately an­ti­cli­mac­tic duel be­tween two Amer­i­cans who have had break­through mo­ments in Arthur Ashe Sta­dium when it was full of fans in­stead of be­ing all but empty be­cause of the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Wil­liams, a six-time US Open cham­pion, and Stephens, who won the ti­tle in 2017, sel­dom man­aged to play well at the same time.</p>
    <p>Stephens could do lit­tle wrong in the first set – mak­ing five un­forced er­rors to her op­po­nent’s 13 as she ab­sorbed her pace, dom­i­nated the ex­tended ral­lies and ex­ploited pat­terns.</p>
    <p>But the serve re­mains the pace­maker for Wil­liams’ game, and when it started work­ing, she started rip­ping open-stance fore­hand win­ners, shoring up her shaky back­hand and mak­ing fewer mis­takes on the move.</p>
    <p>With her 39th birth­day loom­ing later this month, the 23-time Grand Slam sin­gles cham­pion is not as quick into and out of the cor­ners as she was in her prime.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she did not wa­ver in fin­ish­ing off the 26th seed, win­ning 10 of the last 12 games to com­plete the vic­tory, lead­ing Stephens to hail her op­po­nent’s serve as “one of the great­est in the game”.</p>
    <p>To­day, Wil­liams will get a re­match with 15th seed Maria Sakkari in the fourth round.</p>
    <p>The Greek up­set Wil­liams in the last 16 nearly two weeks ago at the West­ern and South­ern Open, but she is not ex­pect­ing a sim­i­lar straight­for­ward out­come here.</p>
    <p>“Ser­ena is Ser­ena,” the world No. 22 said af­ter ad­vanc­ing on Sat­ur­day by dis­pos­ing of Amer­i­can</p>
    <p>Amanda Anisi­mova 6-3, 6-1. “You have to come up with some great ten­nis. Oth­er­wise, there is no chance against her.”</p>
    <p>In a re­match of their Mel­bourne Park quar­ter-fi­nal in Jan­uary, Aus­tralian Open cham­pion Sofia Kenin weath­ered a bar­rage of 35 win­ners from Ons Jabeur by break­ing the Tu­nisian’s serve three times en route to a 7-6 (7-4), 6-3 vic­tory.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond seed re­cov­ered from a 4-2 deficit in the open­ing set, mark­ing the first time the world No. 4 Amer­i­can has reached the fourth round at Flush­ing Mead­ows.</p>
    <p>In the men’s draw, both sec­ond seed Do­minic Thiem and third seed Daniil Medvedev also moved into the last 16.</p>
    <p>Aus­tria’s Thiem con­quered for­mer US Open cham­pion Marin Cilic of Croa­tia 6-2, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3, while Rus­sia’s Medvedev downed Amer­i­can Jef­frey Wolf 6-3, 6-3, 6-2. They will next face Felix Auger-Alias­sime of Canada and Amer­i­can Frances Ti­afoe re­spec­tively.</p>
