    <p>Among the first gold­smiths in the colo­nial port cities were those from In­dia and Sri Lanka.</p>
    <p>“When you ex­am­ine the way the di­a­monds are set, they sug­gest old Euro­pean tech­niques, adapted by In­dian and Sri Lankan jewellers,” says Per­anakan scholar Peter Lee.</p>
    <p>Ap­par­ently, the older Chi­nese gold­smiths used to em­ploy In­dian or Sri Lankan gem set­ters to set the di­a­monds and other stones.</p>
    <p>Only from the 1930s did Chi­nese gold­smiths fully em­brace gem set­ting.</p>
    <p>Some of the ear­li­est names deal­ing in au­then­tic</p>
    <p>Per­anakan pieces were Kwong Chong Leong in High Street, Chong Seng Gold­smith in Mid­dle Road, Kwong Heng and Mean Sing in Arab Street and Nam Loong in North Bridge Road.</p>
    <p>Other jewellers such as B. P. de Silva catered to a se­lect clien­tele of Straits Chi­nese, who pre­ferred be­spoke pieces rather than dis­play items.</p>
    <p>By the late 1970s, Foun­da­tion Jewellers had es­tab­lished them­selves as mak­ers of au­then­tic Per­anakan jew­ellery, with the widest range of de­signs in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Fronted by jew­ellery de­signer Thomis Kwan, 66, and his wife and busi­ness part­ner Caro­line Tay, 55, Foun­da­tion has six jew­ellery crafts­men spe­cial­is­ing in Per­anakan de­signs.</p>
    <p>Ms Tay says start­ing a col­lec­tion of Per­anakan jew­ellery does not cost the earth.</p>
    <p>“I would ad­vise start­ing with a pair of ear­rings at about $600 and build­ing up slowly to a pen­dant or bracelet for about $2,000,” says Ms Tay. Some of the items on dis­play at the shop can cost from $150,000 to seven-fig­ure sums.</p>
    <p>“When you wear Per­anakan jew­ellery, you are wear­ing a piece of art that can­not be found in any other cul­ture ex­cept in Sin­ga­pore,” says Mr Kwan, who says he “fell in love” with the Per­anakan style of craft­ing jew­ellery when he started help­ing out at his fa­ther’s gold­smith’s shop in the 1970s.</p>
    <p>“You can find the melt­ing pot of cul­tures that de­fines Sin­ga­pore in ev­ery curve, swirl and bev­elled edge of a piece of Per­anakan jew­ellery.”</p>
    <p>Mr Kwan’s de­vo­tion to his craft has won him in­ter­na­tional ac­claim.</p>
    <p>In 2012, then Pres­i­dent Tony Tan Keng Yam pre­sented Mr Kwan’s orig­i­nal de­sign of a bird of par­adise brooch made with 18K yel­low gold and 61 bril­liant-cut di­a­monds to Bri­tain’s Queen El­iz­a­beth II as a gift for her Di­a­mond Ju­bilee.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Mr Lee, Foun­da­tion has “tran­scended the legacy of Per­anakan jew­ellery”.</p>
    <p>“What I see are works of art that are in­no­va­tive, rel­e­vant, con­tem­po­rary, yet clearly con­nected to the past,” says Mr Lee, who adds the Per­anakan lin­eage of Malay, In­dian, Sri Lankan, Chi­nese and Euro­pean jewellers is ev­i­dent in Foun­da­tion’s pieces.</p>
    <p>“Foun­da­tion has added to this legacy with its un­der­stand­ing of gem qual­ity, work­man­ship and de­sign,” he says.</p>
    <p>“Per­son­ally, I am less in­ter­ested in the clas­sic pieces, but those show­cas­ing in­no­va­tion.”</p>
