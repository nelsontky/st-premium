    <p>At its in­cep­tion in Au­gust 1967, Asean em­pha­sised the sovereignt­y of states and voiced its com­mit­ment to non-in­ter­ven­tion and non-in­ter­fer­ence in the in­ter­nal af­fairs of states.</p>
    <p>This prin­ci­ple shaped Asean’s re­sponse to the Viet­namese in­va­sion and oc­cu­pa­tion of Cam­bo­dia in De­cem­ber 1978, de­spite the geno­ci­dal mas­sacres of the Kh­mer Rouge gov­ern­ment in Ph­nom Penh.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, Asean took no ac­tion when mar­tial law was de­clared by then Philip­pine Pres­i­dent Fer­di­nand Mar­cos in 1972, re­mained on the side­lines when suc­ces­sive demo­cratic gov­ern­ments were over­thrown by coups in Thai­land, and wel­comed Myan­mar into Asean with the end of the Cold War de­spite the con­tin­u­ance of Myan­mar’s military regime and sup­pres­sion of Ms Aung San Suu Kyi and the Na­tional League for Democ­racy.</p>
    <p>How­ever, an out­come from the 53rd Asean For­eign Min­is­ters’ Meet­ing hosted vir­tu­ally by Viet­nam ear­lier this month in­di­cates a chang­ing per­spec­tive on hu­man rights is­sues.</p>
    <p>This can be seen in the para­graphs of the joint com­mu­nique of the min­is­ters dis­cussing the cri­sis in Rakhine state in Myan­mar.</p>
    <p>More than 700,000 Mus­lim Ro­hingya had fled from Myan­mar’s western Rakhine state to Bangladesh af­ter a bru­tal military crack­down against Ro­hingya in­sur­gents in 2017.</p>
    <p>While the for­eign min­is­ters did not ex­plic­itly re­fer to the ex­pul­sion of the Ro­hingya pop­u­la­tion, they stressed the im­por­tance of “Myan­mar’s com­mit­ment to en­sure safety and se­cu­rity for all com­mu­ni­ties in Rakhine state as ef­fec­tively as pos­si­ble and fa­cil­i­tate the vol­un­tary re­turn of dis­placed per­sons in a safe, se­cure and dig­ni­fied man­ner”.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian For­eign Min­is­ter Retno Mar­sudi went fur­ther, urg­ing Myan­mar to re­solve the root of the is­sue – the need for the safe, vol­un­tary, dig­ni­fied and sus­tain­able repa­tri­a­tion of Ro­hingya refugees to Rakhine.</p>
    <p>AP­PROACH OVER THE YEARS</p>
    <p>A look back shows that Asean’s ap­proach first be­gan to shift with the adoption of the Asean Char­ter in Sin­ga­pore in 2007.</p>
    <p>One of the char­ter’s prin­ci­ples ex­plic­itly called on mem­ber states to act in “re­spect for fun­da­men­tal free­dom, the pro­mo­tion and</p>
    <p>pro­tec­tion of hu­man rights, and the pro­mo­tion of so­cial jus­tice”.</p>
    <p>The char­ter’s ref­er­ence to an Asean hu­man rights body was the ba­sis for the estab­lish­ment of the Asean In­ter­gov­ern­men­tal Com­mis­sion on Hu­man Rights (AICHR) at the 15th Asean Sum­mit in Cha-am, Thai­land, in 2009.</p>
    <p>This led to the Asean Hu­man Rights Dec­la­ra­tion adopted at the Ph­nom Penh Sum­mit in 2012.</p>
    <p>The dec­la­ra­tion in­cluded gen­eral prin­ci­ples as well as pro­vi­sions on civil and po­lit­i­cal rights, eco­nomic and cul­tural rights, to­gether with sec­tions on the right to devel­op­ment and the right to peace.</p>
    <p>This did not sat­isfy some Western ob­servers, who felt that the dec­la­ra­tion fell short of ex­ist­ing hu­man rights stan­dards.</p>
    <p>Although the Asean gov­ern­ments had reached a con­sen­sus on the in­ter-gov­ern­men­tal na­ture of the com­mis­sion, Thai­land, Malaysia, and In­done­sia ap­pointed civil so­ci­ety ac­tivists and non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion (NGO) lead­ers as their rep­re­sen­ta­tives.</p>
    <p>These rep­re­sen­ta­tives pushed for re­sponses to com­mu­ni­ca­tions from civil so­ci­ety, the par­tic­i­pa­tion of NGOs in AICHR meet­ings and out­reach by AICHR to the global hu­man rights com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, there was strong re­sis­tance from Myan­mar, Laos, Viet­nam and Cam­bo­dia to mov­ing from the pro­mo­tion of hu­man rights to ac­tive pro­tec­tion of hu­man rights.</p>
    <p>While off-the-record ex­changes oc­curred on is­sues such as the</p>
    <p>dis­ap­pear­ance of prom­i­nent</p>
    <p>Lao­tian ac­tivist Som­bath Som­phone and the mas­sive refugee cri­sis aris­ing from the evic­tion of the Ro­hingya from Rakhine, the af­fected states blocked for­mal dis­cus­sions on such is­sues.</p>
    <p>Still, Asean moved be­yond look­ing at hu­man rights only through a for­eign min­istry lens. Dia­logues have oc­curred on is­sues in­clud­ing the rights of women, chil­dren and per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties, hu­man traf­fick­ing, the right to ed­u­ca­tion, cor­po­rate so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity and en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>This led sev­eral Sin­ga­pore civil so­ci­ety or­gan­i­sa­tions to par­tic­i­pate in AICHR events.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Coun­cil of Women’s Or­gan­i­sa­tions, Maruah (Work­ing Group for an Asean Hu­man Rights Mech­a­nism) and Minds (Move­ment for the In­tel­lec­tu­ally Dis­abled of</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore) have so far been ac­cred­ited by AICHR.</p>
    <p>ASEAN AND IN­TER­NA­TIONAL CON­VEN­TIONS</p>
    <p>The estab­lish­ment of AICHR led to pres­sure to rat­ify or ac­cede to the nine core United Na­tions Hu­man Rights In­stru­ments as the ac­ces­sion record of mem­ber states is dis­cussed at AICHR meet­ings.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is party to four con­ven­tions: the Elim­i­na­tion of All Forms of Dis­crim­i­na­tion Against Women, the Rights of the Child, the Rights of Per­sons with Dis­abil­i­ties, and the Elim­i­na­tion of All Forms of Racial Dis­crim­i­na­tion (ICERD).</p>
    <p>It is ironic that Sin­ga­pore has not yet ac­ceded to the In­ter­na­tional</p>
    <p>Covenant on Eco­nomic, So­cial and Cul­tural Rights (ICESCR). This was a prod­uct of the Cold War.</p>
    <p>The Soviet bloc and non-aligned states sought to shift at­ten­tion away from the Western fo­cus on in­di­vid­ual and per­sonal rights in the In­ter­na­tional Covenant on Civil and Po­lit­i­cal Rights by em­pha­sis­ing the rights of the com­mu­nity, as re­flected in the ICESCR.</p>
    <p>As the Cold War is now his­tory, early ac­ces­sion to ICESCR would re­flect Sin­ga­pore’s em­pha­sis on the need for a bal­anced ap­proach to hu­man rights, one that weighs in­di­vid­ual rights against so­cial obli­ga­tions and the in­ter­ests of the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Within Asean, dif­fer­ent mem­ber states have placed dif­fer­ent em­phases on hu­man rights pri­or­i­ties.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Sin­ga­pore ac­tivists have drawn at­ten­tion to Malaysia’s han­dling of hu­man rights is­sues, which they viewed pos­i­tively.</p>
    <p>But while Malaysia has adopted a high pro­file, es­pe­cially on the rights of Pales­tini­ans and Ro­hingya refugees, it has moved even more slowly on ac­ces­sion to UN hu­man rights con­ven­tions.</p>
    <p>With at least 2.2 mil­lion doc­u­mented for­eign work­ers and an­other three to four mil­lion un­doc­u­mented il­le­gal work­ers, Malaysia, like Sin­ga­pore, is un­likely to ac­cede to the In­ter­na­tional Con­ven­tion on the Pro­tec­tion of the Rights of All Mi­grant Work­ers and Mem­bers of Their Fam­i­lies (ICRMW), an is­sue raised within the AICHR by the rep­re­sen­ta­tives of In­done­sia and the Philip­pines,</p>
    <p>which are Malaysia’s lead­ing sources of mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond ex­am­ple is Malaysia’s lack of ac­tion on ICERD. Although ac­ces­sion to ICERD was a cam­paign pledge of the Pakatan Hara­pan coali­tion, do­mes­tic pres­sure from Malays who were con­cerned that ac­ces­sion would un­der­mine Malay spe­cial rights re­sulted in the Cab­i­net re­vers­ing its po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent Perikatan Na­sional coali­tion is even more un­likely to change this de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>AC­TION AND COM­MIT­MENTS</p>
    <p>Ac­ces­sion to UN con­ven­tions does not nec­es­sar­ily mean that states up­hold their com­mit­ments.</p>
    <p>Cam­bo­dia, for ex­am­ple, has ac­ceded to all the nine core in­stru­ments ex­cept for the ICRMW.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it con­tin­ues to be in the news for forced dis­ap­pear­ances, ar­bi­trary ar­rests and de­ten­tion, al­le­ga­tions of tor­ture and as a haven for child pros­ti­tu­tion and child pornog­ra­phy.</p>
    <p>The Spe­cial Rap­por­teur of the UN Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral has high­lighted that the “hu­man rights sit­u­a­tion in Cam­bo­dia re­mains dom­i­nated by the re­pres­sion of po­lit­i­cal rights”.</p>
    <p>While Thai­land has played an ac­tive role in widen­ing and deep­en­ing cov­er­age of hu­man rights is­sues in AICHR, se­vere penal­ties for lese ma­jeste of­fences and dis­ap­pear­ances of junta crit­ics re­main the prac­tice in Bangkok.</p>
    <p>The same is true of In­done­sia, which has wit­nessed a de­cline in the pro­tec­tion of re­li­gious mi­nori­ties in­clud­ing the Shi’ite, Ah­madiyya and Chris­tian com­mu­ni­ties in the post-Suharto era, as well as the tor­ture, ex­tra­ju­di­cial killings and forced dis­ap­pear­ances of West Pa­puan dis­si­dents.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, while the Philip­pines has been a lead­ing voice on civil and po­lit­i­cal rights is­sues in AICHR and the UN, there has been a sharp up­ward trend in sum­mary ex­e­cu­tions of al­leged drug deal­ers and crim­i­nals in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>THE EA­GLE MEETS THE PANDA</p>
    <p>The de­bate within Asean on hu­man rights is­sues was also in­flu­enced by developmen­ts in the in­ter­na­tional geopo­lit­i­cal en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the col­lapse of the Soviet Union, the United States was the sole su­per­power and the Euro­pean Union ex­panded sig­nif­i­cantly into the for­mer Soviet bloc in East­ern Europe.</p>
    <p>Western val­ues were in the as­cen­dancy, re­sult­ing in a cul­ture-bound def­i­ni­tion of hu­man rights, which high­lighted the per­sonal rights and in­ter­ests of the in­di­vid­ual. This ex­plained the crit­i­cisms from Western hu­man rights groups of AICHR pro­cesses and Asean’s com­mit­ment to universal hu­man rights.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the 1980s and 1990s were also the era which wit­nessed the dra­matic eco­nomic emer­gence of China, In­dia and states in East Asia.</p>
    <p>No one can ar­gue to­day that the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment fails to meet the ba­sic needs of its ci­ti­zens or that the lives of or­di­nary Chi­nese peo­ple have not im­proved im­mea­sur­ably com­pared with 40 years ago.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese lead­er­ship’s fo­cus is on the broader in­ter­ests of Chi­nese so­ci­ety through eco­nomic devel­op­ment, so­cial co­he­sion and po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity. The cur­rent gen­er­a­tion of Chi­nese na­tion­als ap­pear strongly sup­port­ive of their po­lit­i­cal lead­er­ship and its ef­forts to shape the do­mes­tic and global en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>In this con­text, the Covid-19 pan­demic has raised per­ti­nent ques­tions about the bal­ance be­tween in­di­vid­ual rights and com­mu­nity in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments have been forced to re­strict the ac­tiv­i­ties of their ci­ti­zens and to utilise tech­nol­ogy for con­tact trac­ing. They have also im­posed travel re­stric­tions, re­quired the use of masks in public places and placed lim­its on per­sonal free­dom through the im­po­si­tion of lock­downs.</p>
    <p>The US faced ma­jor dif­fi­cul­ties in im­pos­ing these re­stric­tions, re­sult­ing in it hav­ing the worst pan­demic out­break glob­ally.</p>
    <p>By con­trast, China, which was the source of the Covid-19 pan­demic, ef­fec­tively man­aged the out­break by tak­ing de­ci­sive ac­tion, af­ter ini­tially fail­ing to con­trol its spread.</p>
    <p>These developmen­ts will in­flu­ence states in the East Asian re­gion. The com­mu­ni­tar­ian in­stincts of gov­ern­ments in East Asia will lead to a grow­ing ques­tion­ing of the cur­rent dom­i­nant in­ter­na­tional per­spec­tives in the field of hu­man rights. The mea­sured ap­proach taken by AICHR is likely to be closer to the new norm in the years ahead as the global bal­ance shifts away from unipo­lar dom­i­nance by the US.</p>
