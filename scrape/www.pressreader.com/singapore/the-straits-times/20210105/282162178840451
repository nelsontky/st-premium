    <p>A pro­posed law on guns, ex­plo­sives and weapons dis­cussed in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day aims to fur­ther tighten con­trols and strengthen penal­ties for high-risk items such as au­to­matic weapons.</p>
    <p>The changes also aim to ad­dress new threats posed by tech­nol­ogy shifts, such as 3D-printed guns and drones mounted with weapons.</p>
    <p>Among the changes pro­posed un­der the Guns, Ex­plo­sives and Weapons Con­trol Bill is one mak­ing the unau­tho­rised pos­ses­sion of a dig­i­tal blue­print of a gun or a gun part an of­fence, given the rel­a­tive ease of man­u­fac­tur­ing a work­ing gun us­ing a 3D printer and blue­print taken off the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>The max­i­mum fines for gun and ex­plo­sive of­fences will also be raised to $50,000 for in­di­vid­u­als and $100,000 for en­ti­ties – up from the cur­rent $10,000 – to match the penal­ties for un­li­censed ac­tiv­i­ties in­volv­ing ex­plo­sive pre­cur­sors.</p>
    <p>The Bill ad­dresses the threat of drones loaded with guns, ex­plo­sives and weapons, by mak­ing it clear that a per­son who con­trols a ve­hi­cle or ves­sel car­ry­ing such items, even if via re­mote con­trol, is treated as pos­sess­ing them.</p>
    <p>A class li­cens­ing regime for lowor mod­er­ate-risk users and ac­tiv­i­ties was also in­tro­duced to pro­vide some reg­u­la­tory con­trol with­out the need for in­di­vid­ual li­cens­ing.</p>
    <p>Such users in­clude stu­dents who han­dle air guns as part of their cocur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­i­ties in schools.</p>
    <p>With class li­cens­ing, such users need not be put through se­cu­rity clear­ance, and need not ap­ply for or re­new an in­di­vid­ual li­cence pe­ri­od­i­cally, al­though a class li­cence can be sus­pended with re­spect to a spe­cific li­censee if cer­tain con­di­tions are con­tra­vened, such as if some­one is con­victed of an of­fence un­der a re­lated law. The pro­posed changes will also reg­u­late shoot­in­grange op­er­a­tions here to en­sure their safety, an ac­tiv­ity that pre­vi­ously did not re­quire li­cens­ing.</p>
    <p>In­tro­duc­ing the Bill yes­ter­day, Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs Des­mond Tan said that the Bill re­in­forces the Govern­ment’s po­si­tion that any han­dling of guns, ex­plo­sives and weapons is “a priv­i­lege that is con­di­tioned on the over­rid­ing need to en­sure we meet the ob­jec­tive of pub­lic safety and se­cu­rity, and that strict con­trols are re­quired to achieve this ob­jec­tive”.</p>
    <p>The draft Act seeks to re­place the Arms and Ex­plo­sives Act, the Ex­plo­sive Sub­stances Act and the Dan­ger­ous Fire­works Act. It also seeks to make amend­ments to other leg­is­la­tion re­lated to guns, ex­plo­sives and weapons.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said that in de­vel­op­ing the Bill, of­fences and penal­ties across the var­i­ous laws were ra­tio­nalised to achieve greater co­her­ence, con­sis­tency and clar­ity.</p>
    <p>“Reg­u­la­tory breaches like non­com­pli­ance with li­cence con­di­tions or un­li­censed ac­tiv­i­ties will be crim­i­nalised un­der the Bill, whereas ac­tions with crim­i­nal in­tent will be of­fences un­der the other Acts and carry heav­ier pun­ish­ments,” he said.</p>
    <p>Un­der the pro­posed changes, the Min­is­ter for Home Af­fairs will be vested with a new power to is­sue “se­cu­rity direc­tions”, when a sit­u­a­tion re­quires a more ex­pe­di­ent re­sponse than mod­i­fy­ing li­cens­ing con­di­tions al­lows, such as if there is im­mi­nent threat to life or prop­erty.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter can di­rect li­censees and even those ex­empted from the Bill to im­me­di­ately put in place en­hanced mea­sures, or to tem­po­rar­ily sus­pend, cease or scale down their ac­tiv­i­ties for a pe­riod of time.</p>
    <p>This can­not be ap­pealed and is lim­ited to six months, with non­com­pli­ance be­ing an of­fence.</p>
    <p>The list of weapons to be reg­u­lated will be ex­panded to in­clude throw­ing stars and knuck­le­dusters, which are very un­likely to have com­mon day-to-day uses, added Mr Tan. Gun ac­ces­sories such as flash sup­pres­sors and si­lencers that can en­hance the per­for­mance of guns will also be reg­u­lated un­der the Bill, with lower penal­ties than those for guns as they pose a lower risk.</p>
    <p>The threat of ex­trem­ist at­tacks re­mains very real, he cau­tioned, with se­ri­ous in­ci­dents in coun­tries with strict gun and weapon con­trol laws. “We must not pre­sume that these at­tacks can­not hap­pen in Sin­ga­pore,” he said.</p>
    <p>The need to op­ti­mise re­sources to reg­u­late a grow­ing in­dus­try is an­other rea­son for the changes pro­posed in the Bill, said Mr Tan. The to­tal num­ber of gun, ex­plo­sive and weapon li­censees has more than dou­bled from around 2,000 in 2010 to over 4,000 last year.</p>
    <p>The po­lice must reg­u­late this grow­ing pool ef­fec­tively, oth­er­wise there is a risk of lapses go­ing un­de­tected, with po­ten­tially dis­as­trous safety or se­cu­rity con­se­quences, he added.</p>
    <p>The draft Act also al­lows the Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter to pre­scribe items as pro­hib­ited guns, ex­plo­sives and weapons, with re­lated of­fences that will at­tract even higher fines of up to $100,000 for per­sons, and $200,000 for en­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>These are items which are iden­ti­fied as par­tic­u­larly dan­ger­ous or may be more read­ily con­cealed and would be par­tic­u­larly suited to un­law­ful use, such as cer­tain types of au­to­matic firearms com­monly used by ter­ror­ists, said Mr Tan. “No li­cence will be granted for the han­dling of these items,” he said.</p>
    <p>Unau­tho­rised pos­ses­sion of a dig­i­tal blue­print for a gun or gun part would in­clude phys­i­cally own­ing a stor­age de­vice with such a doc­u­ment, or stor­ing such a blue­print out­side the coun­try, such as in an over­seas cloud stor­age ser­vice.</p>
    <p>But the in­tent is not to tar­get those who could not rea­son­ably be ex­pected to have known that they possess such blue­prints, such as some­one who browses the In­ter­net out of cu­rios­ity and finds a gun blue­print, which is tem­po­rar­ily stored in the browser cache, said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>De­bate on the Bill re­sumes to­day, with over 10 MPs set to speak.</p>
