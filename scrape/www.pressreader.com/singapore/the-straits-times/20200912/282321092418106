    <p>I was sur­prised to read about the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity’s (LTA) de­ci­sion to spend $556 mil­lion on a new-gen­er­a­tion Elec­tronic Road Pric­ing (ERP) sys­tem, which ba­si­cally acts as a real-time dis­play panel (New ERP sys­tem to start in 2023 with­out dis­tance charg­ing, Sept 9).</p>
    <p>Is this the right time to spend money like this when such real-time in­for­ma­tion can eas­ily be ob­tained by mo­torists with their in-built nav­i­ga­tion sys­tem in their cars or with the use of Google Maps on their mo­bile phones?</p>
    <p>Should we not be sav­ing this money for a new sys­tem that is dif­fer­ent from the cur­rent one, with more ad­vanced tech­nol­ogy?</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said on Thurs­day that LTA had some prac­ti­cal con­straints, hav­ing called for an in­ter­na­tional ten­der for the project and that it was con­trac­tu­ally bound (Con­ges­tion-pric­ing model to re­main for new ERP sys­tem, Sept 11). He went on to say: “There can be con­sul­ta­tions and change of de­sign but it will af­fect the con­tract. We will have to see how to do this bet­ter next time.”</p>
    <p>Isn’t it bet­ter to pay a penalty to can­cel the ten­der or use a force ma­jeure clause, to free par­ties from obli­ga­tions or li­a­bil­i­ties due to Covid-19, rather than spend the mil­lions with no in­put from mo­torists?</p>
    <p>We need to save now and not spend un­wisely. In ad­di­tion, while the gantries are bulky, this should not be a rea­son to spend at this stage un­less we are 100 per cent cer­tain on de­sign and tech­nol­ogy. I hope this de­ci­sion will be re­con­sid­ered.</p>
