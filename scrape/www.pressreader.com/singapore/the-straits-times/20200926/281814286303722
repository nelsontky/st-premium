    <p>• Hos­pi­tals in Madrid are fill­ing up with se­ri­ously ill Covid-19 pa­tients again, rais­ing the spec­tre of a health­care col­lapse sim­i­lar to the grim scenes southern Europe ex­pe­ri­enced in spring.</p>
    <p>The per­cent­age of in­ten­sive care beds with coro­n­avirus pa­tients in the Span­ish cap­i­tal re­gion jumped to 39 per cent on Thurs­day from 25 per cent at the end of last week, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial data.</p>
    <p>But Pro­fes­sor Miguel Her­nan, a Har­vard Univer­sity epi­demi­ol­o­gist who has ad­vised the Span­ish gov­ern­ment, said the way Spain counts ca­pac­ity un­der­states the strain, and in­ten­sive care unit (ICU) beds in Madrid ac­tu­ally are al­most full.</p>
    <p>“We are once again fac­ing a se­ri­ous health emer­gency,” Prof Her­nan said on Twit­ter. “ICUs were our last line of de­fence.”</p>
    <p>It is the lat­est sign of cri­sis as many parts of Europe, in­clud­ing France and Bri­tain, com­bat a post­sum­mer pan­demic surge.</p>
    <p>“With­out ad­e­quate ca­pac­ity to di­ag­nose, trac­ers or su­per­vi­sion of iso­la­tion and quar­an­tine, the last hope was that hos­pi­tals wouldn’t be sat­u­rated,” said Prof Her­nan, who had ad­vised the gov­ern­ment on lift­ing one of the strictest na­tional lock­downs in the world in late June.</p>
    <p>A re­newed lock­down in Spain could be shorter than the first one and less se­vere, be­cause now “the curve is flat­ter”, he said.</p>
    <p>Daily new cases in Spain de­clined to 3,471 on Thurs­day, al­most 700 fewer than the pre­vi­ous day. The coun­try now has 704,209 cases, in­clud­ing 31,118 deaths af­ter an­other 500 pa­tients died of the dis­ease over the past week, ac­cord­ing to Health Depart­ment data.</p>
    <p>While Spain’s daily cases are be­low spring lev­els, they have wors­ened pro­gres­sively since last month.</p>
    <p>Madrid has al­ready been clamp­ing down, or­der­ing re­stric­tions on Sept 18 for 37 ar­eas, in­clud­ing Madrid neigh­bour­hoods and towns in the met­ro­pol­i­tan area, that al­low peo­ple to leave only for es­sen­tial rea­sons such as work or study.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Pe­dro Sanchez and re­gional Madrid Pres­i­dent Is­abel Diaz Ayuso said this week that they will form a joint task force to re­spond to the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Spain’s de­cen­tralised health sys­tem has com­pli­cated the fight against the virus, as the re­gional au­thor­i­ties can set their own poli­cies and the cen­tral gov­ern­ment has failed to align them.</p>
    <p>Many re­gions never en­acted rec­om­men­da­tions made early in the pan­demic by gov­ern­ment ad­vis­ers, such as in­creas­ing the num­ber of trac­ers and ICU beds.</p>
