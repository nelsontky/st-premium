    <p>SMOOTH RIDE</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, it’s very hard to find a place you can con­tinue ped­alling for 20 min­utes non-stop at high power be­cause you’ll hit a traf­fic light or you’ll have to turn. But, with this, you can go faster since you don’t have to worry about ex­ter­nal fac­tors like traf­fic.</p>
    <p>DAR­REN LIM, na­tional cy­clist, on one ben­e­fit of the smart trainer.</p>
    <p>In the past, when na­tional cy­clist Sa­muel Leong had to com­plete his in­ter­val train­ing thrice a week, he would have to set off at 6am so he could train when the roads were less crowded.</p>
    <p>But, since he started us­ing a smart trainer at home in March, he can now do his in­ter­val train­ing at any time.</p>
    <p>The 19-year-old Nanyang Poly­tech­nic stu­dent sim­ply re­moves his rear wheel and at­taches his bike to his Garmin Tacx Neo smart trainer, which in turn is linked to vir­tual train­ing app Zwift. The com­bi­na­tion al­lows him to se­lect over­seas routes, feel the ter­rain and gra­di­ent of the route as well as see an­i­mated scenery – all while rid­ing on his own bike in his own home.</p>
    <p>Other apps such as Tacx Train­ing and RGT Cy­cling also of­fer sim­i­lar func­tions and train­ing pro­grammes while Cy­cleOps, Ki­netic, Mi­noura and Techn­o­gym are other brands of train­ers in the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Leong, who is part of the ProCy­clingSG Academy at the Sin­ga­pore Cy­cling Fed­er­a­tion (SCF), told The Straits Times: “This helps me to save time be­cause I can start train­ing at any time of the day. Now, af­ter home-based learn­ing, I can just hop onto the bike, fin­ish my ses­sion, then sleep early.</p>
    <p>“It also makes train­ing less mun­dane be­cause we can look at some­thing else in­stead of just fo­cus­ing on the num­bers.”</p>
    <p>His favourite route is the Alpe du Zwift, mod­elled af­ter the iconic Alpe d’Huez in south­ern France, which in­volves him cy­cling up­hill for about an hour, some­thing he can­not repli­cate in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>His team­mate Dar­ren Lim added that train­ing in­doors some­times raises the qual­ity of train­ing as well. The cy­clists, who train about</p>
    <p>25 hours a week, can also race against other com­peti­tors in Sin­ga­pore or over­seas vir­tu­ally on the same plat­form.</p>
    <p>Lim, 22, said: “In Sin­ga­pore, it’s very hard to find a place you can con­tinue ped­alling for 20 min­utes non-stop at high power be­cause you’ll hit a traf­fic light or you’ll have to turn. But, with this, you can go faster since you don’t have to worry about ex­ter­nal fac­tors like traf­fic.</p>
    <p>“It’s also re­ally hum­bling, es­pe­cially when your avatar is be­hind a pro cy­clist’s avatar. It tells us that there’s some­one way stronger than you and we’re still not at that level yet.</p>
    <p>“Out­doors, we won’t be able to im­me­di­ately go up against them in com­pe­ti­tions but, with this, we can see straight­away where we stand.”</p>
    <p>Andy Chia, 35, di­recteur sportif at ProCy­clingSG Academy, said the trainer also helps strengthen the cy­clists as there is no wind re­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>“You can’t coast on the trainer. Ev­ery­thing is sheer power and no mat­ter what, they would have to grind to pro­duce re­sults,” he said.</p>
    <p>“These train­ers have a power sen­sor so there’s a cer­tain power they need to hit. It’s re­ally just hard work so, phys­i­o­log­i­cally, it helps them be­come stronger ath­letes.</p>
    <p>“It can­not sim­u­late phys­i­cal com­pe­ti­tions 100 per cent but, in terms of race tac­tics, they can learn some of these skills.”</p>
    <p>The ben­e­fits of the trainer are not just for com­pet­i­tive cy­clists. Par­tic­i­pants of The OCBC Cy­cle 2020 Vir­tual Ride can also com­plete the 23km The Straits Times</p>
    <p>VR or the 42km The Sportive VR on the de­vices.</p>
    <p>A ba­sic trainer costs about $200 while smart train­ers, which can be con­nected to a smart de­vice, start from $500. Those that come with bikes can cost thou­sands.</p>
    <p>Chia said: “With the use of smart train­ers, the re­sis­tance changes ac­cord­ing to the ter­rain, so you must ap­ply more force when go­ing up­hill, which is like do­ing strength train­ing at the gym.</p>
    <p>“It’s also en­gag­ing be­cause you can still ride with your friends. And it brings you vir­tu­ally to places you have never been to be­fore.”</p>
    <p>With a 40 per cent in­crease in in­door cy­cling ac­tiv­i­ties dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod – based on data from Garmin de­vices like watches and in­door bi­cy­cles in Sin­ga­pore – Garmin com­mu­nity man­ager Ed­win Shen be­lieves in­door cy­cling will re­main pop­u­lar even af­ter the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He said: “It of­fers cy­clists a great al­ter­na­tive as they can still ex­pe­ri­ence the sen­sa­tion of cy­cling on the road de­spite be­ing in­doors on smart train­ers.</p>
    <p>“With most peo­ple work­ing from home, they can squeeze in a quick ride at lunch time or at night. They are un­able to travel, but can still ex­pe­ri­ence dif­fer­ent ter­rains and routes around the world, or sched­ule a ride with friends vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>“In Sin­ga­pore, where the weather can be rather un­pre­dictable, in­door cy­cling al­lows avid cy­clists to con­tinue with their rid­ing plans while rid­ing in a safe en­vi­ron­ment.”</p>
