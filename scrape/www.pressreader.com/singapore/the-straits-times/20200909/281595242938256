    <p>In­dia and China have ac­cused each other of fir­ing in the air dur­ing a new con­fronta­tion on their bor­der in the western Hi­malayas, in a fur­ther es­ca­la­tion of ten­sion.</p>
    <p>NEW DELHI/BEIJING • In­dia and China have ac­cused each other of fir­ing in the air dur­ing a new con­fronta­tion on their bor­der in the western Hi­malayas, in a fur­ther es­ca­la­tion of mil­i­tary ten­sion be­tween the nu­clear-armed na­tions.</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of troops are in eye­ball-to-eye­ball prox­im­ity along the re­mote bor­der, which wit­nessed a clash in June that killed 20 In­dian sol­diers in hand-to-hand fight­ing, and an un­known num­ber of Chi­nese ca­su­al­ties.</p>
    <p>Both sides have ob­served a longheld pro­to­col to not use firearms in the sen­si­tive, un­de­mar­cated fron­tier area, though this agree­ment has not pre­vented ca­su­al­ties.</p>
    <p>The In­dian army said yes­ter­day that troops from the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army (PLA) tried on Mon­day night to close in on a for­ward In­dian po­si­tion at the Line of Ac­tual Con­trol (LAC), or the de facto bor­der, in the Ladakh sec­tor.</p>
    <p>“And when dis­suaded by (In­dian troops), PLA troops fired a few rounds in the air in an at­tempt to in­tim­i­date (In­dian) troops,” it said, adding that the In­dian side acted with re­straint.</p>
    <p>“At no stage has the In­dian army trans­gressed across the LAC or re­sorted to use of any ag­gres­sive means, in­clud­ing fir­ing,” it said.</p>
    <p>But China said the In­dian forces had breached the in­for­mal bor­der through the south­ern bank of the Pan­gong Tso lake.</p>
    <p>“The In­dian troops brazenly made gun­shot threat to the pa­trolling Chi­nese bor­der guards who came for­ward for ne­go­ti­a­tions, and the Chi­nese bor­der guards were forced to take coun­ter­mea­sures to sta­bilise the sit­u­a­tion,” Mr Zhang Shuili, a rep­re­sen­ta­tive of the PLA’s western the­atre com­mand, said.</p>
    <p>China’s for­eign min­istry said In­dian troops had il­le­gally crossed the LAC and were the first to fire shots. “This is a se­ri­ous mil­i­tary provo­ca­tion,” said spokesman Zhao Li­jian.</p>
    <p>Mil­i­tary com­man­ders and diplo­mats from both sides have held sev­eral rounds of talks since July to re­duce ten­sions, but have made lit­tle progress to thin out forces in the arid, high-al­ti­tude area that both na­tions claim and con­sider as vi­tal to their se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>The l at­est uptick i n ten­sions around the alpine Pan­gong Lake be­gan late last month when In­dian forces mo­bilised to de­ter Chi­nese troops, whose move­ments sug­gested they aimed to oc­cupy a hill­top New Delhi re­gards as its ter­ri­tory, In­dian of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>Both na­tions have urged the other to re­strain for­ward troops who have been locked in a face-off since April, af­ter In­dia said China in­truded deep into its side of the LAC.</p>
    <p>China de­nies the charge.</p>
    <p>“We re­quest the In­dian side to im­me­di­ately stop dan­ger­ous ac­tions... and strictly in­ves­ti­gate and pun­ish per­son­nel who fired shots to en­sure that sim­i­lar in­ci­dents do not oc­cur,” the PLA’s Mr Zhang said.</p>
    <p>In­dia and China fought a bor­der war in 1962 and con­tinue to lay claim to ter­ri­tory stretch­ing from the snow deserts of Ladakh in the west to moun­tain forests in the east.</p>
    <p>And when dis­suaded by (In­dian troops), PLA troops fired a few rounds in the air in an at­tempt to in­tim­i­date (In­dian) troops.</p>
