    <p>From to­day, res­i­dents liv­ing in the north will be able to seek ur­gent med­i­cal at­ten­tion at a new fa­cil­ity within the community.</p>
    <p>Sit­u­ated in Kam­pung Ad­mi­ralty, the Ur­gent Care Cen­tre (UCC) pro­vides res­i­dents with med­i­cal at­ten­tion for acute but non-life-threat­en­ing con­di­tions, said the Wood­lands Health Cam­pus (WHC) on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Acute con­di­tions are of­ten sud­den in their on­set – ex­am­ples in­clude sud­den vom­it­ing and di­ar­rhoea, or sud­den ab­dom­i­nal pain.</p>
    <p>Span­ning 470 sq m, the cen­tre jointly op­er­ated by WHC and Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal (KTPH) has three con­sul­ta­tion rooms, and an ob­ser­va­tion area with two beds and two re­clin­ers, among other fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>It is also equipped to pro­vide ser­vices such as splint or cast ap­pli­ca­tions for frac­tures and dis­lo­ca­tions, stitch­ing for cuts and wounds, as well as the ad­min­is­tra­tion of in­tra­venous flu­ids or IV drips.</p>
    <p>Dr Lim Eng Koon, clin­i­cal di­rec­tor of UCC@Ad­mi­ralty, said: “The UCC is equipped to han­dle ur­gent and acute con­di­tions, and it is manned by a multi-dis­ci­plinary team of health­care pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>“The cen­tre also has on-site X-ray and blood test­ing fa­cil­i­ties, and it is open from 8am to 11pm daily so that res­i­dents can have their med­i­cal needs at­tended to in a timely man­ner and in one lo­ca­tion.”</p>
    <p>Dr Mo­han Tiru, deputy chair­man of the med­i­cal board (sur­gi­cal and am­bu­la­tory ser­vices) at the WHC, said: “The UCC sup­ports ur­gent care needs of pa­tients in the community by di­vert­ing non-emergency cases away from the emergency de­part­ment (ED), so that the ED can pro­vide bet­ter and time­lier care for sicker pa­tients.”</p>
    <p>Gen­eral prac­ti­tioner (GP) clin­ics re­main the rec­om­mended first stop for com­mon ail­ments in this “holis­tic ecosys­tem of care”, he added.</p>
    <p>To fa­cil­i­tate this, WHC and KTPH will be jointly rolling out the GPFirst pro­gramme in the north, which will be op­er­a­tional from to­day, to en­cour­age res­i­dents to seek treat­ment at their near­est GP clinic for com­mon con­di­tions like cough, runny nose and sim­ple sprains, in­stead of go­ing to the ED.</p>
    <p>There has been an 8 per cent in­crease in self-ad­mit­ted pa­tients to the ED each year, Dr Mo­han noted.</p>
    <p>Around 40 GP clin­ics lo­cated in the north of Sin­ga­pore will be par­tic­i­pat­ing.</p>
    <p>To fur­ther en­cour­age pa­tients to visit their GPs for con­sul­ta­tions first, pa­tients who have re­ceived GP re­fer­rals to the UCC or the ED may re­ceive $50 off their pa­tient fees.</p>
    <p>In 2014, Changi Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal’s launch of the GPFirst pro­gramme saw more than 100 GPs in the east­ern re­gion com­ing on board, which re­sulted in a 10 per cent drop in the num­ber of cases at the hos­pi­tal’s emergency de­part­ment that year.</p>
    <p>“Even with the new cen­tre, it’s still im­por­tant for peo­ple to cul­ti­vate a close re­la­tion­ship with their GPs, who know their med­i­cal his­tory well, and can be their first point of con­tact should they be un­sure on the kind of med­i­cal at­ten­tion that they need,” said Dr Mo­han.</p>
