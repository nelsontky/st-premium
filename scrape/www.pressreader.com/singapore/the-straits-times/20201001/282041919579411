    <p>MIN­IS­TER FOR CUL­TURE, COM­MU­NITY AND YOUTH ED­WIN TONG , on dis­play­ing the Sin­ga­pore flag.</p>
    <p>No one has ever been fined for fly­ing the na­tional flag be­yond the time pe­riod al­lowed un­der the Sin­ga­pore Arms and Flag and Na­tional An­them (SAFNA) Act, and the au­thor­i­ties do not plan to start do­ing so.</p>
    <p>This was re­vealed by Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong in a Face­book post yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Let me as­sure you: As far as I know, no one has ever been fined for this, nor do we plan to do so,” he wrote, ad­dress­ing con­cerns over re­cent me­dia re­ports about a po­ten­tial fine for those who con­tinue to fly the flag from to­day.</p>
    <p>“But in cases of de­lib­er­ate disre</p>
    <p>spect against the flag in any way, we will of course take ac­tion,” said Mr Tong, who is also Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Law.</p>
    <p>He added that the law, which stip­u­lates a fine of up to $1,000 for of­fend­ers, is meant to safe­guard the dig­nity of the flag.</p>
    <p>“There’s no rea­son to ‘pun­ish’ those who treat it with re­spect and dig­nity, and are proud to show­case the Sin­ga­pore spirit. Pa­tri­o­tism is not just a right, it’s sim­ply right,” he said.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, The Straits Times re­ported that those who con­tinue to dis­play the na­tional flag af­ter yes­ter­day will risk be­ing fined up to $1,000 un­der SAFNA.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery year, the flag can be dis­played out­side a build­ing or in an open space with­out a flag­pole be</p>
    <p>tween July 1 and Sept 30.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, the time­frame was ex­tended to al­low the flag to be dis­played in such a man­ner from April 25 to yes­ter­day, as a ral­ly­ing sym­bol in the on­go­ing Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the amend­ment, a Straits Times Fo­rum let­ter writer asked if the min­istry would con­sider al­low­ing the flag to be dis­played out­side homes through­out the year.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, se­nior direc­tor of the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth’s re­silience and en­gage­ment di­vi­sion, Mr Letchu­manan Narayanan, said a con­sid­er­a­tion for al­low­ing the dis­play of the flag is whether the dig­nity of the flag can be pro­tected from wear and tear due to ex­tended dis­play or ne­glect.</p>
    <p>The rule for dis­play­ing the flag</p>
    <p>has changed over the years. In 2007, the SAFNA Act was amended to al­low the flag to be dis­played with­out a flag­pole or the need to be il­lu­mi­nated at night be­tween July 1 and Sept 30.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, this was al­lowed only dur­ing the month of Au­gust for Na­tional Day cel­e­bra­tions.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Tong said his min­istry ini­ti­ated a re­view of SAFNA rules be­fore the re­cent re­port.</p>
    <p>The po­ten­tial amend­ments may al­low for more oc­ca­sions on which the flag can be dis­played, while protecting it from ex­tended dis­play or ne­glect.</p>
    <p>He called for mem­bers of the pub­lic to share their sug­ges­tions at https://go.gov.sg/sin­ga­pore­flag</p>
