    <p>•</p>
    <p>Europe’s resur­gent coro­n­avirus pan­demic is threat­en­ing to shut down Paris’ culi­nary in­sti­tu­tions and spurring record cases in the con­ti­nent’s east.</p>
    <p>The dis­ease is spread­ing at such a pace in Paris that pos­i­tive tests and the num­ber of in­ten­sive-care pa­tients have climbed past the “max­i­mum alert” level, French Health Min­is­ter Olivier Veran told re­porters.</p>
    <p>If the trend con­tin­ues, “we have no choice” but to de­clare the cap­i­tal and its nearby sub­urbs a high-risk area as soon as next Mon­day, which would trig­ger the clos­ing of bars and restau­rants, he said on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tives of France’s hos­pi­tal­ity in­dus­try are try­ing to thwart the move and were plan­ning to present pro­pos­als to the au­thor­i­ties yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron is seek­ing to avoid a sec­ond na­tion­wide lock­down, but tar­geted mea­sures have shown lit­tle im­pact.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s virus cases i ncreased the most in Europe over the past two months and have reached nearly 617,000, ac­cord­ing to Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity, while monthly Covid-19-re­lated deaths tripled last month.</p>
    <p>The so-called win­ter resur­gence has sparked a spate of tighter re­stric­tions across Europe, threat­en­ing a stum­bling re­cov­ery af­ter na­tional lock­downs ham­mered economies in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>In Hun­gary, Poland and the Czech Re­pub­lic, new cases hit daily records.</p>
    <p>The Czech Re­pub­lic has the sec­ond-worst out­break in Europe and de­clared a state of emer­gency this week. It recorded 3,493 new coro­n­avirus cases on Thurs­day, the high­est daily count since the pan­demic reached the coun­try in March, data by the Health Min­istry showed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The over­all num­ber of con­firmed cases grew to 74,255 in the coun­try of 10.7 mil­lion, where 678 peo­ple have died in con­nec­tion with the ill­ness.</p>
    <p>Trends are wor­ry­ing across Europe.</p>
    <p>London res­i­dents are be­ing told to take im­me­di­ate ac­tion to avoid catch­ing and spread­ing the dis­ease amid warn­ings that the Bri­tish cap­i­tal is at a “tip­ping point”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Bri­tain’s Of­fice for Na­tional Statis­tics (ONS) said yes­ter­day there is some lim­ited ev­i­dence that the re­cent sharp rise in new cases in Eng­land is lev­el­ling off.</p>
    <p>New cases of Covid-19 in Eng­land to­talled about 8,400 a day in the week up to Sept 24, down from about 9,600 a day dur­ing the pre­vi­ous week, an ONS es­ti­mate said.</p>
    <p>Ger­many had the most new daily in­fec­tions since April, as did Italy, where Prime Min­is­ter Giuseppe Conte is seek­ing to ex­tend his emer­gency pow­ers un­til Jan 31.</p>
    <p>New cases in Ger­many are “pre­dom­i­nantly due to trans­mis­sion at fam­ily and other pri­vate events”, the coun­try’s Robert Koch In­sti­tute said in its lat­est sit­u­a­tion re­port.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of con­firmed cases in Ger­many in­creased by 2,673 to 294,395, data from the in­sti­tute showed yes­ter­day. The re­ported death toll rose by eight to 9,508.</p>
    <p>To counter the spread of the virus, Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel’s gov­ern­ment this week rec­om­mended lim­its on pub­lic and pri­vate gath­er­ings in hard-hit ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the au­thor­i­ties in Italy ruled yes­ter­day that face masks will have to be worn at all times out­doors in the cap­i­tal Rome and the sur­round­ing Lazio re­gion.</p>
    <p>Italy on Thurs­day reg­is­tered more than 2,000 new coro­n­avirus cases for the first time since the end of April. Lazio ac­counted for 265 of those cases and has been in­creas­ingly con­cerned by the grow­ing con­ta­gion.</p>
    <p>“Most of the cases are tied to the lack of re­spect in us­ing masks and in so­cial dis­tanc­ing,” Lazio’s health chief Alessio D’Amato told re­porters yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Italy was the first coun­try in Europe to be slammed by Covid-19 and has the sec­ond-high­est death</p>
    <p>toll in Europe af­ter Bri­tain, with al­most 36,000 peo­ple dy­ing since the out­break flared in Fe­bru­ary. It has reg­is­tered 317,409 cases.</p>
    <p>In Spain – again the epi­cen­tre of the pan­demic on the con­ti­nent – the virus fight has been bogged down by in­fight­ing.</p>
    <p>Madrid’s re­gional lead­ers yes­ter­day filed a le­gal chal­lenge against a cen­tral-gov­ern­ment de­cree im­pos­ing a par­tial lock­down across the cap­i­tal and nine nearby towns, just hours be­fore it came into force.</p>
    <p>With 859 cases for ev­ery 100,000 peo­ple, ac­cord­ing to the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, the Madrid re­gion is the worst Covid-19 hot spot in Europe.</p>
    <p>With the new re­stric­tions that came into force at 10pm yes­ter­day (4am to­day in Sin­ga­pore), 4.8 mil­lion peo­ple will see bor­ders closed to out­siders for non-es­sen­tial vis­its, with only travel for work, school, doc­tors’ vis­its or shop­ping al­lowed. A cur­few for bars and restau­rants will be moved to 11pm from 1am.</p>

Mean&#xAD;while, in Italy, the au&#xAD;thor&#xAD;i&#xAD;ties have ruled that in Rome (be&#xAD;low), face masks now have to be worn at all times out&#xAD;doors.</p>
