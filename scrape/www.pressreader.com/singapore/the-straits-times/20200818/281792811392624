    <p>All viruses mu­tate. Re­searchers who an­a­lysed and tracked Sars-CoV-2 – the coro­n­avirus that causes Covid-19 – have re­leased find­ings about mu­tat­ing strains of the virus, even be­fore the Malaysian and Philip­pine health au­thor­i­ties an­nounced they had seen pa­tients with mu­ta­tions of the virus.</p>
    <p>Q How many vari­ants of Sars-CoV-2 are there?</p>
    <p>A The orig­i­nal strain found in China when Covid-19 first emerged in Jan­uary was dubbed D614.</p>
    <p>G614 – of­ten re­ferred to as the “G strain” – is a mu­tated vari­ant which was preva­lent across Europe and North Amer­ica by May. This strain has been more vir­u­lent – in­fect­ing more peo­ple and found in more places – than the orig­i­nal one.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers say there is an­other strain now, D614G, which is even more preva­lent. This is the one the Malaysian health au­thor­i­ties on Sun­day de­scribed as be­ing 10 times more in­fec­tious. Some sci­en­tists claim the D614G vari­ant has been cir­cu­lat­ing in South-east Asia as early as Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Q Are the mu­ta­tions dead­lier?</p>
    <p>A While the vari­ants are more con­ta­gious, there is no ev­i­dence sug­gest­ing that they are more deadly than ear­lier ver­sions. For ex­am­ple, mul­ti­ple stud­ies have shown the G strain to pro­duce more of the virus in the hu­man body than the D strain but it did not lead to higher hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion rates.</p>
    <p>Dr Bette Korber, a the­o­ret­i­cal bi­ol­o­gist and lead au­thor of a study on D614G, said in an in­ter­view last month: “It is the dom­i­nant virus in the world. It took only about a month for that to hap­pen and it is now the one we should be look­ing at.”</p>
    <p>Vi­rol­o­gists at US-based Scripps Re­search, in a study pub­lished last month, found that viruses with the D614G mu­ta­tion were far more in­fec­tious than the oth­ers.</p>
    <p>But some sci­en­tists have ar­gued that just be­cause one strain trav­els far­ther, it does not nec­es­sar­ily mean it is more in­fec­tious. The qual­ity of health­care and the ca­pac­ity to han­dle an out­break should also be taken into con­sid­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Q How to re­act to mu­ta­tions?</p>
    <p>A Changes in pre­ven­tive mea­sures to con­tain the spread of Covid-19 will not make a dif­fer­ence, whether the virus is more in­fec­tious or not, sci­en­tists said.</p>
    <p>“The ba­sic pil­lars of preven­tion and con­trol of Covid-19 remain the same,” Dr San­jay Ram­pal, an epi­demi­ol­o­gist with Univer­siti Malaya, said in an in­ter­view, adding that the au­thor­i­ties could in­stead im­prove ca­pac­ity for screen­ing, con­tact trac­ing and treat­ment.</p>
    <p>It is the dom­i­nant virus in the world. It took only about a month for that to hap­pen and it is now the one we should be look­ing at.</p>
    <p>DR BETTE KORBER, a the­o­ret­i­cal bi­ol­o­gist and lead au­thor of a study on D614G, on the strain.</p>
