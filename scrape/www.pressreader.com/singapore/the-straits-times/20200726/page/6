        Top of theNews | The Sunday Times Sunday, July 26, 2020 | A6 News analysis A steady as it goes Cabinet with eyes firmly on crisis ahead continuity, if you consider that Mr Wong had a stint at Education when he first entered politics.
Mr Desmond Lee has been at National Developmen­t ever since he became an office-holder in 2013, first as a minister of state, then senior minister of state, and second minister from 2017.
Ms Fu was at Environmen­t and Water Resources from 2011 to 2012 as senior minister of state, and then second minister from 2012 to 2015.
At a time when issues are becoming more complex, familiarit­y with these issues – whether they are the concerns of home owners or hawkers – can help ministers better shape, refine and calibrate policy changes and explain them to Singaporea­ns. This is a good thing.
But there has also been a degree of targeted change to expose office-holders to a range of portfolios.
Thus the appointmen­ts of key fourth- generation ministers to strategic portfolios such as Education and Transport.
Significan­tly, the process of renewal also continues. The appointmen­t of Dr Tan See Leng as a full minister – Second Minister for Trade and Industry, as well as Manpower – will enable him to bring his private-sector perspectiv­e to economy policymaki­ng, help ensure that policies are effective in helping businesses, and align economic and manpower policies.
Four new MPs will also be ministers of state – e2i deputy chief executive Gan Siow Huang in Education and Manpower; Mr Alvin Tan, outgoing head of public policy and economics at
LinkedIn, in Culture, Community and Youth as well as Trade and Industry; former People’s Associatio­n chief Desmond Tan in Home Affairs as well as Sustainabi­lity and the Environmen­t; and former Infocomm Media Developmen­t Authority chief Tan Kiat How in National Developmen­t and the Prime Minister’s Office.
As has been the case for previous batches of new appointees, younger office-holders who perform well can expect to be promoted in subsequent Cabinet changes, and stretched and stress-tested in new roles.
If Covid-19 abates in the next year or two, some of the seven current senior ministers of state and seven ministers of state can expect to be moved up and about, and the balance between continuity and change recalibrat­ed as political renewal proceeds apace. Zakir Hussain News Editor The latest Cabinet line-up places greater emphasis on continuity over change – a departure from the previous two post-general election reshuffles in 2011 and 2015.
And for good reason. The current grave crisis underlined the need to maintain a greater degree of continuity than he would otherwise have done, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted in his press conference yesterday.
Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat takes on the role of Coordinati­ng Minister for Economic Policies, and both senior ministers Teo Chee Hean and Tharman Shanmugara­tnam will stay on to help tackle the crisis.
As the Covid-19 pandemic poses a challenge to public health and the healthcare system as well as the economy and jobs, having ministers Gan Kim Yong, Chan Chun Sing and Josephine Teo remaining at the helm of their ministries provides much-needed continuity at a critical time.
The impetus for change has always been there to give ministers exposure and renew the front bench. But it has just been deferred, owing to Covid-19.
PM Lee himself acknowledg­ed this when he said: “I hope that within not too long a time, as the situation stabilises... it will be possible for me to make further changes.”
Nine years ago, when PM Lee announced his new Cabinet line-up after the 2011 General Election, 11 out of the 14 ministries had new ministers.
Two were new MPs: Former Monetary Authority of Singapore managing director Heng Swee Keat was made Minister for Education, and former army chief Chan Chun Sing was appointed Acting Minister for Community Developmen­t, Youth and Sports.
And seven new faces from among the re-elected and new MPs joined the Government, including Mr Lawrence Wong, who was made Minister of State for Defence and Education.
After the 2015 General Election, nine out of the 15 ministries saw new ministers at the helm.
Among them were newly elected acting education ministers Ng Chee Meng, who oversaw schools, and Ong Ye Kung, who oversaw higher education and skills.
Other newly elected MPs made office-holders included Dr Janil Puthuchear­y, Dr Koh Poh Koon and Mr Chee Hong Tat, who became ministers of state.
In contrast, the latest Cabinet reshuffle sees just six of the 15 ministries getting new leaders: Environmen­t and Water Resources, which has been renamed Sustainabi­lity and the Environmen­t (Ms Grace Fu); Social and Family Developmen­t (Mr Masagos Zulkifli); Education (Mr Lawrence Wong); Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung); National Developmen­t (Mr Desmond Lee); and Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Edwin Tong).
But there is even greater Nine out of 37 office-holders are women Second Minister for National Developmen­t, relinquish­ing her Education portfolio. She will remain Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office and Second Finance Minister, and assist Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean on population matters.
Dr Khor, who used to be Senior Minister of State for Health, will now be Senior Minister of State for Transport and Sustainabi­lity and Environmen­t. Meanwhile, Ms Sim will be Senior Minister of State for National Developmen­t and Communicat­ions and Informatio­n. out of a pool of 20 full ministers, compared with three out of 19 before.
The other women office-holders are Dr Amy Khor, Ms Sim Ann, Ms Low Yen Ling and Ms Sun Xueling.
Ms Low and Ms Sun have both been promoted to Minister of State.
Ms Low will take up the Trade and Industry and Culture, Community and Youth portfolios, while Ms Sun will take up the Education and Social and Family Developmen­t portfolios.
Mrs Teo remains Manpower Minister, while Ms Fu will head the newly renamed Ministry of Sustainabi­lity and the Environmen­t.
Ms Indranee will be appointed weather the recession and emerge stronger after the storm,” Ms Gan said in a Facebook post.
In a separate post, Ms Rahayu said: “I am humbled by this trust and opportunit­y to continue serving in a different capacity.”
The number of women in Cabinet has inched up over the years, and this is the largest cohort of women office-holders in recent times.
But the proportion of women who are full ministers has gone down slightly, with more men added to the team. There will be three women full ministers – Mrs Josephine Teo, Ms Grace Fu, Ms Indranee Rajah – Linette Lai There are nine women among this term’s line-up of 37 political officehold­ers, with two newcomers among them.
They are People’s Action Party new face Gan Siow Huang, who has been appointed Minister of State for Education and Manpower, and MP Rahayu Mahzam, who will be appointed Parliament­ary Secretary for Health from Sept 1.

Ong Ye Kung, while the role of Coordinati­ng Minister for Infrastruc­ture will be left unfilled.
PM Lee also disclosed that Mr Khaw, who was hospitalis­ed with dengue fever last week, had recovered and was discharged yesterday.
As for Mr Tan, who has held portfolios in multiple ministries since joining politics in 2006, including Foreign Affairs and Manpower, PM Lee said he had been invaluable in reflecting the feedback of the Chinese ground.
Mr Tan will also step down as chairman of the Government’s feedback unit Reach, and will be replaced in the role by new MP Tan Kiat How, who was former chief executive of the Infocomm Media Developmen­t Authority. pointed as senior parliament­ary secretary in 2018, had ably represente­d Singapore’s interests at internatio­nal meetings and looked after consumer interest through his work with the Consumers Associatio­n of Singapore.
Dr Tan had asked to leave to return to medical practice and said on Facebook yesterday that while his time in government had been meaningful, his “first love has always been personally looking after patients and people”.
The oncologist had said the same to PM Lee in a letter which he made public. He added that he would contribute actively in Parliament.
Thanking Dr Tan for his contributi­ons, PM Lee said: “I look forward to more good work from him as a senior MP in Jurong GRC.”
Meanwhile, both Mr Khaw and Lim Min Zhang Three office-holders from the previous Cabinet have stepped down.
They are Senior Parliament­ary Secretary for Foreign Affairs and Trade and Industry Tan Wu Meng, former Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan, 67, and Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Social and Family Developmen­t Sam Tan, 61, who both announced last month that they would not stand for election.
Dr Tan, 45, is the only young political office-holder to retire in the latest reshuffle. He will return to medical practice.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday thanked all three men for their contributi­ons in Government.
He said Dr Tan, who was ap- Mr Tan had been expected to retire from the Cabinet after stepping down from politics.
Mr Khaw leaves after a political career spanning nearly 20 years.
PM Lee noted that Mr Khaw had been in his Cabinet “since Day 1”, adding: “I’m happy that he will continue to make himself available to advise the younger ministers on issues that he is familiar with, and to share his experience and wisdom.”
With Mr Khaw’s departure, his transport portfolio will go to Mr mzlim@sph.com.sg Details of resources given to Leader of the Opposition to be announced this week tion that Mr Singh will be designated as the Leader of the Opposition, and that he will be provided with the appropriat­e staff and resources.
Former prime minister Goh Chok Tong, who retired from politics ahead of the election, called it a “very significan­t move” that acknowledg­es voters’ desire for more opposition MPs in Parliament.
Singapore’s parliament­ary system is modelled after the Westminste­r system in Britain.
There, the Leader of the Opposition draws a salary on top of the MP allowance, and picks a shadow Cabinet to follow the work of govern- ment department­s.
At the recent polls, the WP won four seats in the new Sengkang group representa­tion constituen­cy and retained the five-member Aljunied GRC and single seat Hougang.
In response to PM Lee’s announceme­nt, Mr Singh had said: “I look forward to serving as the Leader of the Opposition and will carry out my duties to the best of my abilities. I will endeavour to ensure that the Workers’ Party under my leadership will remain loyal to Singapore and all Singaporea­ns.” which he had designated on the Workers’ Party (WP) chief after the opposition party won 10 seats in three constituen­cies in the July 10 General Election.
“The main thing is we’re recognisin­g the leader of the main opposition party in Parliament,” PM Lee said at a virtual press conference to announce his new Cabinet. “We hope that this will lead to the opposition in Parliament playing a more constructi­ve and more substantiv­e role, not just asking questions of the Government, but also putting up alternativ­es, putting up proposals and being scrutinise­d.”
He added that this would allow Singaporea­ns to understand what Fabian Koh the trade-offs, issues and choices are, and “we can have a better quality of debate, a better public comprehens­ion of the national priorities and issues and we hope a better government for Singapore”.
PM Lee had announced in a press conference after the general elec- An announceme­nt will be made this week on the resources given to the Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh.
