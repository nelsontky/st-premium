    <p>The re­trench­ment and un­em­ploy­ment fig­ures in the sec­ond quar­ter are sober­ing (Un­em­ploy­ment at high­est in a decade, re­trench­ments up, July 30).</p>
    <p>It is all the more dis­heart­en­ing to know that the num­bers will get worse for the rest of this year and pos­si­bly be­yond, due to the Covid-19 pan­demic (Ex­perts fear worst may be yet to come in job mar­ket, July 30).</p>
    <p>Job losses af­fect not just em­ploy­ees but also their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>The sup­port schemes that have been put in place to save jobs and busi­nesses as well as to pro­vide re­lief to af­fected in­di­vid­u­als are un­prece­dented in their scale.</p>
    <p>We need to come to grips with this dire eco­nomic si­t­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to the new jobs, trainee­ships, train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties and at­tach­ments be­ing cre­ated or fa­cil­i­tated by the Gov­ern­ment, there is an­other op­tion for the un­em­ployed to con­sider.</p>
    <p>One im­me­di­ate way to find a job is to cre­ate it, as an in­de­pen­dent ser­vice provider to ser­vice buy­ers. Self-em­ploy­ment makes sense in these ex­tra­or­di­nary times.</p>
    <p>It is a good start to re­gain­ing the dig­nity of work, be it an as­sign­ment, project, part-time en­gage­ment or short-term em­ploy­ment. The only over­heads would be from one­self.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans seek­ing free­lance work could ap­proach the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion (SNEF) and Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion (SBF) to of­fer their ser­vices to their mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Such ini­tia­tive demon­strates re­source­ful­ness, re­spon­si­bil­ity and re­silience in the face of a dif­fi­cult si­t­u­a­tion be­yond one’s con­trol.</p>
    <p>SNEF and SBF could per­haps help by com­pil­ing a list of ser­vice providers, with de­tails of their ex­pe­ri­ence, ex­per­tise and ed­u­ca­tion, and con­nect them with in­ter­ested mem­bers, as part of their cor­po­rate so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies will ben­e­fit from lower costs, as there is no need for Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund con­tri­bu­tions and other em­ploy­ment ex­penses.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power could also link the ser­vice providers to gov­ern­ment or­gan­i­sa­tions for such work op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 cri­sis is tem­po­rary. The re­ces­sion and un­em­ploy­ment will end one day. Tem­po­rary em­ploy­ment to tide over the tran­si­tion may be an an­swer. Joachim Sim Khim Huang</p>
