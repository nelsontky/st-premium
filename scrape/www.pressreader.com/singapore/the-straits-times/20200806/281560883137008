    <p>There is some light at the end of the tun­nel for Sin­ga­pore re­tail sales, with the re­open­ing of shops and re­sump­tion of din­ing in at food and bev­er­age out­lets. Al­though re­tail sales in June fell, this was at a slower pace than in the month be­fore, ac­cord­ing to data from the De­part­ment of Sta­tis­tics.</p>
    <p>There is some light at the end of the tun­nel for Sin­ga­pore re­tail sales, with the re­open­ing of shops and re­sump­tion of din­ing in at food and bev­er­age out­lets.</p>
    <p>Al­though re­tail sales in June fell, this was at a slower pace than in the month be­fore, ac­cord­ing to data from the De­part­ment of Sta­tis­tics yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Tak­ings at the till slid 27.8 per cent com­pared with the same pe­riod last year, af­ter sink­ing a record 52 per cent in May.</p>
    <p>Ex­clud­ing mo­tor ve­hi­cles, re­tail sales fell 24.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>This is on the back of the grad­ual re­open­ing of the econ­omy, as Sin­ga­pore en­tered phase one of the eas­ing of the cir­cuit breaker re­stric­tions on June 2 and phase two on June 19.</p>
    <p>Year on year, re­tail sales slumped for the 17th straight month in June.</p>
    <p>But com­pared with May, sea­son­ally ad­justed re­tail sales recorded a huge up­swing of 51.1 per cent, in­di­cat­ing re­tail sales may have bot­tomed out.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts, how­ever, cau­tioned that any re­cov­ery will be mod­est ow­ing to con­tin­ued eco­nomic chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>May­bank Kim Eng econ­o­mist Lee Ju Ye said: “The big jump in mon­thon-month num­bers for dis­cre­tionary items sug­gests there has been some pent-up con­sumer de­mand fol­low­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“Move­ments at re­tail and re­cre­ation venues have also im­proved as of end-July com­pared with endJune, as the num­ber of com­mu­nity Covid-19 cases has stayed low and more peo­ple gain con­fi­dence to ven­ture out.”</p>
    <p>But re­tail is not out of the woods, she added, with the econ­omy in re­ces­sion, the labour mar­ket see­ing large losses and house­hold in­comes fall­ing. “Con­sumer sen­ti­ments will likely re­main sub­dued for the rest of the year, which will weigh on big-ticket pur­chases and dis­cre­tionary items.”</p>
    <p>In June, sales were lifted by su­per­mar­kets and hy­per­mar­kets, which con­tin­ued to regis­ter strong tak­ings that shot up 43.4 per cent year on year.</p>
    <p>Com­puter and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions equip­ment re­tail­ers also saw sales go­ing up by 20.9 per cent, with bur­geon­ing de­mand from con­sumers work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>Min­i­marts and con­ve­nience stores had higher sales of 8.7 per cent.</p>
    <p>But all other cat­e­gories reg­is­tered dou­ble-digit drops year on year, with de­part­ment stores bear­ing the brunt as their sales plunged 69.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>Sales of wear­ing ap­parel and footwear dived 63.4 per cent, while tak­ings from watches and jew­ellery re­tail­ers fell 53.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mo­tor ve­hi­cle sales tum­bled 47.8 per cent, and those of food and al­co­hol dropped 45.7 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, sales of food and bev­er­age (F&B) ser­vices slid by 43.5 per cent in June. All cat­e­gories reg­is­tered drops, with res­tau­rants lead­ing the way with a fall of 59 per cent.</p>
    <p>Tak­ings for food cater­ers shrank by 48.1 per cent, while sales at cafes, food­courts and other eat­ing places dwin­dled by 32.7 per cent.</p>
    <p>Fast-food out­lets reg­is­tered a 20.5 per cent con­trac­tion in sales.</p>
    <p>The to­tal sales value of F&B ser­vices in June was es­ti­mated at $496 mil­lion. Of this, on­line F&B sales made up an es­ti­mated 32.7 per cent.</p>
    <p>The es­ti­mated to­tal re­tail sales value in June was about $2.6 bil­lion. Of this, on­line re­tail sales made up an es­ti­mated 18.1 per cent.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy Se­lena Ling said there should be im­prove­ment in the months ahead, but it will not be a straight­for­ward re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>“Con­sump­tion is very tied to con­sumer con­fi­dence. If they’re not con­fi­dent about job se­cu­rity, wage in­creases and bonus ex­pec­ta­tions, they’re not go­ing to rush out for big-ticket items.</p>
    <p>“Glob­ally, the resur­gence in Covid-19 cases means... we are not go­ing to get in­ter­na­tional trav­ellers com­ing back here,” she added.</p>
    <p>How­ever, United Over­seas Bank econ­o­mist Barn­abas Gan said: “Bar­ring a rein­tro­duc­tion of so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, the re­turn of do­mes­tic con­sumer de­mand should help to cush­ion the rate of con­trac­tion on a year-on-year per­spec­tive for the rest of 2020.”</p>
    <p>PENT-UP DE­MAND</p>
    <p>The big jump in month-on-month num­bers for dis­cre­tionary items sug­gests there has been some pent-up con­sumer de­mand fol­low­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod. ’’</p>
