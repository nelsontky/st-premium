    <p>As Sin­ga­pore en­ters a new nor­mal with the grad­ual eas­ing of var­i­ous re­stric­tions, large gath­er­ings and fes­tiv­i­ties, such as Na­tional Day com­mu­nity con­certs and sev­enth lu­nar month events, will by and large con­tinue to re­main vir­tual, the Health Min­istry (MOH) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But there will be ex­cep­tions.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said sev­enth lu­nar month prayers and post-fu­neral re­li­gious rites, con­ducted by re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions with a good track record of im­ple­ment­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures, will be al­lowed in places of wor­ship and some ex­ter­nal venues such as Hous­ing Board com­mon ar­eas.</p>
    <p>De­tails on how many peo­ple will be al­lowed to at­tend are ex­pected to be re­leased soon.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence ear­lier yes­ter­day that many Sin­ga­pore­ans have ex­pressed their ea­ger­ness to re­sume reg­u­lar ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Hence, curbs were eased re­cently on wed­dings, wakes and fu­ner­als.</p>
    <p>“We recog­nise that these are key mile­stones in life that Sin­ga­pore­ans hope to com­mem­o­rate, and that mem­o­ries of these events will stay pre­cious long af­ter the Covid-19 pandemic is over.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to as­sess the sit­u­a­tion and al­low the grad­ual re­sump­tion of other events, in­clud­ing wed­ding re­cep­tions and some re­li­gious rites,” he said.</p>
    <p>But most other events should re­main vir­tual for the time be­ing, he added.</p>
    <p>“This does not mean that we can no longer cel­e­brate these oc­ca­sions, but that we will need to find new ways to do so,” he said.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing this year’s Na­tional Day cel­e­bra­tions, the min­is­ter said: “Sin­ga­pore­ans are a re­source­ful peo­ple, and many have found new and cre­ative ways to com­mem­o­rate our na­tion’s in­de­pen­dence while ad­her­ing to the safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“With a right mind­set and at­ti­tude, we can adapt and make the best of the sit­u­a­tion, even if we need to con­tinue with safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have taken ac­tive steps to move Sin­ga­pore into a “new nor­mal” within the pandemic en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>MOH’s direc­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices Ken­neth Mak said the costs of poly­merase chain re­ac­tion tests for Covid-19 will de­crease in the fu­ture as pro­to­cols get op­ti­mised and tests be­come more avail­able, ben­e­fit­ing all vis­i­tors and trav­ellers who will re­quire test­ing when they en­ter or leave Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>More trav­ellers are ex­pected as Sin­ga­pore grad­u­ally re­opens its bor­ders, with test­ing be­ing a nec­es­sary step to en­sure they do not bring the coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion with them.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, the cost is around $200 per test.</p>
    <p>But even as Sin­ga­pore moves to­wards the new nor­mal, Covid-19 task force co-chair Lawrence Wong said the coun­try is un­likely to ever be com­pletely free of the virus.</p>
    <p>De­spite Sin­ga­pore’s re­cent streak of low com­mu­nity cases, it must be wary of a resur­gence in in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>He said: “We still think to­day that there is some un­der­ly­ing rate of in­fec­tion. It’s very, very low, but it is there.</p>
    <p>“And it’s quite likely that this was the case in many other coun­tries where you saw a resur­gence of cases... places where you saw very low case counts on a daily ba­sis for many, many days or even weeks... and then sud­denly things spike up.”</p>
    <p>The key is to learn how to live with the virus, to find new safe ways for peo­ple to carry on with their lives.</p>
    <p>“As long as we are able to put in place the nec­es­sary mea­sures, as long as Sin­ga­pore­ans and res­i­dents of Sin­ga­pore com­ply with the safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, we think we can pro­gres­sively re­sume more ac­tiv­i­ties while keep­ing the in­fec­tion un­der con­trol.”</p>
