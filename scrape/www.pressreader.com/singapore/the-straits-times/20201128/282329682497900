    <p>It is never too late to start tak­ing care of one’s health and mak­ing life­style changes – such as eat­ing health­ier, ex­er­cis­ing reg­u­larly and not smok­ing. Do­ing so can go a long way in pre­vent­ing many dis­eases.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times looks at some tips on how to lead a health­ier life, based on a dis­cus­sion about the is­sue at a health we­bi­nar or­gan­ised by The Straits Times on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Q What is the best way to main­tain joint health as we age, es­pe­cially in the knees?</p>
    <p>A It would be ideal if peo­ple can avoid in­jury, es­pe­cially when they are younger. When young peo­ple sus­tain sports in­juries, for in­stance, it pre­dis­poses them to fu­ture joint prob­lems.</p>
    <p>For those with joint pains, knee-strength­en­ing ex­er­cises such as re­sis­tance and load-bear­ing ex­er­cises would of­fer a lot of help.</p>
    <p>One thing to l ook out for is weight. When peo­ple put on too much weight, they tend to ex­er­cise less, their mus­cles get weaker, and they start to ex­pe­ri­ence joint de­gen­er­a­tion. Keep­ing mus­cles strong is im­por­tant. For in­stance, the kneecap is not con­nected to any­thing. It is the mus­cles that hold and sta­bilise the knee.</p>
    <p>Q Will ex­pos­ing young chil­dren to long hours of screen time harm their vi­sion?</p>
    <p>A There is quite a lot of ev­i­dence that near-work screen read­ing wors­ens my­opia. But there are ways to mit­i­gate this. One is to let chil­dren go out into the open where there is green­ery. Some re­search at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health has shown that spend­ing suf­fi­cient time in sun­lit green ar­eas re­duces the risk of my­opia, es­pe­cially in younger peo­ple.</p>
    <p>An­other way is to get chil­dren to take fre­quent rests from read­ing. Ev­ery 20 min­utes, they should look up for 20 sec­onds at some­thing 20m away.</p>
    <p>Q Is it nec­es­sary to go for a full health check an­nu­ally? What screen­ings are rel­e­vant for the dif­fer­ent age groups?</p>
    <p>A Yes, it is a good prac­tice, es­pe­cially for older peo­ple. A nar­row set of checks is rec­om­mended, such as for high blood pres­sure and di­a­betes, and it is good to watch one’s weight.</p>
    <p>Gen­er­ally, screen­ing should be done for col­orec­tal can­cer and cer­vi­cal can­cer.</p>
    <p>For older peo­ple, it is also im­por­tant to do func­tional test­ing, such as hear­ing and sight, be­cause the im­pair­ment can take place slowly, with­out peo­ple re­al­is­ing it. This would cre­ate prob­lems like so­cial iso­la­tion due to the in­abil­ity to par­tic­i­pate in nor­mal so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The in­abil­ity to en­gage so­cially and cog­ni­tively could lead to an ear­lier on­set of de­men­tia.</p>
