    <p>One of Sin­ga­pore’s key strate­gies against the coro­n­avirus is mass screen­ing of se­lected groups. It is heart­en­ing to note that Sin­ga­pore has done the most Covid-19 test­ing in Asean.</p>
    <p>This en­ables early de­tec­tion as well as ring-fenc­ing of cases be­fore they in­fect oth­ers.</p>
    <p>It is there­fore im­por­tant to go be­yond health­care and mi­grant work­ers in dor­mi­to­ries to other at-risk groups in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Now that mass screen­ing of health­care work­ers and mi­grant work­ers in dor­mi­to­ries is over, we need to test other mi­grant work­ers liv­ing out­side dor­mi­to­ries (in­clud­ing for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers) and also se­niors in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>There may be other at-risk groups who may be added to this list.</p>
    <p>Se­niors in the com­mu­nity, due to their age and co­mor­bidi­ties, are a pri­or­ity high-risk group who would ben­e­fit from test­ing.</p>
    <p>We should go be­yond the few re­gional screen­ing cen­tres that have been set up for this pur­pose. Test­ing can be done in com­mu­nity cen­tres/clubs to make it con­ve­nient for the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>More­over, it can be done with the use of mo­bile teams lo­cated at con­ve­nient points in the com­mu­nity, such as res­i­dents’ com­mit­tee cen­tres.</p>
    <p>As we an­tic­i­pate that the coro­n­avirus will be around for a while – at least an­other one to two years – we need to think of ways to de­ploy peo­ple in the com­mu­nity to test and ed­u­cate peo­ple on Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In the longer term, we can use gen­eral prac­ti­tioner clin­ics as test­ing fa­cil­i­ties when bor­der con­trols are re­laxed and res­i­dents need coro­n­avirus test­ing be­fore they travel overseas.</p>
    <p>We should not al­low an­other cir­cuit breaker to be im­posed. It would only dampen our spir­its and hit the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Be­sides ef­forts to re­vive the econ­omy, we should also scale up mea­sures such as mass test­ing of at-risk groups in the com­mu­nity.</p>
