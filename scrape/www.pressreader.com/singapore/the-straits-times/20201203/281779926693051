    <p>In­done­sia con­tin­ues to strug­gle to con­tain Covid-19 nine months af­ter the pan­demic hit the coun­try, with daily records be­ing set for in­fec­tions as the dis­ease spreads through­out the vast archipelag­o, the world’s fourth most pop­u­lous coun­try with 270 mil­lion peo­ple. The coun­try re­mains the worst hit in South-east Asia with the num­ber of con­firmed cases at 549,508 as of yes­ter­day and 17,199 deaths.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tions and fa­tal­i­ties spiked fol­low­ing a long week­end in late Oc­to­ber dur­ing which, ac­cord­ing to gov­ern­ment data, some 600,000 cases were logged each day of peo­ple vi­o­lat­ing health pro­to­cols at tourist spots. Ob­servers, how­ever, at­trib­uted the spike not just to the peo­ple’s lack of ad­her­ence to safety pro­to­cols, crit­i­cis­ing the gov­ern­ment also for be­ing more con­cerned about the econ­omy than pub­lic health.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo re­minded the pub­lic again of the risks of Covid-19 on Face­book last Satur­day. He posted: “Nine months in pan­demic are nine months of our pa­tience and strength as a na­tion be­ing tested. Never be neg­li­gent, never slack, and don’t be dis­cour­aged.”</p>
    <p>He has or­dered three col­lec­tive leave days be­tween Christ­mas and the New Year – Dec 28, 29 and 30 – be cut to curb the trans­mis­sion of the virus, Co­or­di­nat­ing Hu­man Devel­op­ment and Cul­ture Min­is­ter Muhad­jir Ef­fendy told a press con­fer­ence late last month. Ear­lier this year the gov­ern­ment resched­uled the Hari Raya hol­i­days from May 26 to 29 to the year’s end.</p>
    <p>A city of 11 mil­lion peo­ple, Jakarta, the cap­i­tal, has borne the brunt of the pan­demic with 1,166 new cases recorded yes­ter­day, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of in­fec­tions in the city to 139,085. In the past two weeks, ex­cept for Nov 29, new cases have con­sis­tently ex­ceeded 1,000 daily. The death toll has hit 2,706.</p>
    <p>Re­cent mass gath­er­ings by sup­port­ers of con­tro­ver­sial Is­lamist cleric Rizieq Shi­hab, the leader of vig­i­lante group Is­lamic De­fend­ers Front or FPI, have also raised pub­lic ire over the gov­ern­ment’s seem­ing lack of se­ri­ous­ness in han­dling the pan­demic. Jakarta Gov­er­nor Anies Baswedan, who had met Mr Rizieq, said on Tues­day he had con­tracted Covid-19, days af­ter Deputy Gov­er­nor Ah­mad Riza Pa­tria tested pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>The virus has killed sev­eral re­gional lead­ers and in­fected at least three Cabi­net mem­bers: Trans­porta­tion Min­is­ter Budi Karya Su­madi, Mar­itime Af­fairs and Fish­eries Min­is­ter Edhy Prabowo and Re­li­gious Af­fairs Min­is­ter Fachrul Razi.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Mr Joko again or­dered re­gional lead­ers to step up their ef­forts to curb the spread of the dis­ease. “It is a re­gional leader’s duty to pro­tect their cit­i­zens, and peo­ple’s safety is a top pri­or­ity,” he said.</p>
    <p>The soar­ing cases are putting a strain on health­care fa­cil­i­ties. As of Nov 26, the oc­cu­pancy rate for iso­la­tion wards in two-thirds of the 98 re­fer­ral hos­pi­tals in Jakarta had ex­ceeded 70 per cent, while half were more than 80 per cent full, lat­est gov­ern­ment data ob­tained by The Straits Times showed. Fif­teen re­fer­ral hos­pi­tals re­ported full oc­cu­pancy.</p>
    <p>South-east Asia’s largest econ­omy has also been hit hard by the pan­demic with gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) ex­pected to shrink by 0.6 per cent to 1.7 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>Last month, the Jakarta Post, cit­ing Statis­tics In­done­sia (BPS), said the coun­try’s un­em­ploy­ment rate has surged to its high­est level since 2011 with some 2.67 mil­lion peo­ple job­less. Some 29.12 mil­lion peo­ple or 14.2 per cent of the coun­try’s work­force have been af­fected by the pan­demic, the data showed.</p>
