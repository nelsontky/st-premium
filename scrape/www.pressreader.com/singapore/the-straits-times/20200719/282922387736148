    <p>For decades, real es­tate in the fi­nan­cial hubs of Hong Kong and Sin­ga­pore seemed in­fal­li­ble. Crit­ics of such “con­ven­tional wis­dom” gave the ex­am­ple of the re­cent fi­nan­cial cri­sis, but this was brushed aside as a “once-in-a-life­time” event that could not hap­pen again.</p>
    <p>But it has.</p>
    <p>At its bot­tom i n the re­cent Covid-19 crash, both Hong Kong’s and Sin­ga­pore’s value-weighted port­fo­lio of real es­tate in­vest­ment trusts lost 25 per cent.</p>
    <p>As of the be­gin­ning of the month, the Hong Kong real es­tate port­fo­lio ap­peared to have re­cov­ered while the Sin­ga­pore port­fo­lio was still down 16 per cent.</p>
    <p>In­vestors who thought real es­tate pro­vided sta­ble re­turns with not much risk would have been in for a dou­ble-whammy as real es­tate re­turns cratered at the same time as eq­uity mar­kets world­wide.</p>
    <p>Fo­cus­ing on real es­tate in­vest­ment trusts in Sin­ga­pore with res­i­den­tial and ho­tel prop­er­ties shows an even starker im­age, with cu­mu­la­tive re­turns from the be­gin­ning of the year down over 20 per cent and 40 per cent re­spec­tively over the same time pe­riod.</p>
    <p>REAL ES­TATE RE­TURNS ARE RISKIER THAN YOU THINK</p>
    <p>From Jan­uary 2000 through April 2020, the worst draw­down for Sin­ga­pore real es­tate was over 67 per cent be­tween July 2007 and Au­gust 2012, and the worst draw­down for Hong Kong real es­tate was al­most 70 per cent from Novem­ber 2007 through Novem­ber 2010. And it is not just Sin­ga­pore or Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar draw­downs oc­curred for Ja­pan, with over 75 per cent from April 2006 through April 2013. In fact, real es­tate draw­downs of the United States, Aus­tralia, Sin­ga­pore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Is­rael, Ja­pan and Ger­many were all worse than the max­i­mum draw­down from the MSCI All-World Coun­try stock in­dex re­turns.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, aca­demic research has shown that real es­tate re­turns ex­hibit no out­per­for­mance rel­a­tive to lo­cal and global eq­uity mar­ket in­dices. In fact, the research has shown that com­mon fac­tors driv­ing eq­uity mar­kets also drive real es­tate re­turns.</p>
    <p>WHAT ABOUT PRI­VATE REAL ES­TATE?</p>
    <p>Some may ar­gue that this is not a fair com­par­i­son as the real es­tate as­sets con­sid­ered here are real es­tate in­vest­ment trusts (Reits), which are pack­ages of real es­tate that are traded pub­licly on the stock ex­change.</p>
    <p>In fact, over­all real es­tate in­dices, such as the SRX Prop­erty In­dex, have sub-com­po­nents us­ing prices from pri­vate mar­ket real es­tate, which show a ris­ing trend over the long term.</p>
    <p>The pri­vate non-landed in­dex us­ing data from all re­gions in Sin­ga­pore rose from 124.9 in Jan­uary 2010 to 191.1 in March 2020, a gain of over 53 per cent.</p>
    <p>The price re­turns S&P Sin­ga­pore Reit in­dex over the same time pe­riod rose by 24 per cent. Tak­ing into ac­count Reit div­i­dends, a re­turn of over 103 per cent was gen­er­ated over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>What makes the com­par­i­son be­tween pri­vate and pub­licly traded real es­tate dif­fi­cult is that some in­vestors also live in the home, get­ting a con­sump­tion flow in ad­di­tion to the cap­i­tal gains. This is cer­tainly not pos­si­ble with Reit in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>In this case, the clos­est Reit com­par­i­son is for in­vestors to use div­i­dend in­come from Reits to rent an apart­ment.</p>
    <p>Which num­ber is the right com­par­i­son de­pends on whether an in­vestor is re­ceiv­ing div­i­dends on their pri­vate prop­erty in­vest­ments, whether an in­vestor is ac­tu­ally stay­ing in the pri­vate prop­erty, and what the main­te­nance costs of hold­ing the prop­erty are.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, con­dos have monthly ser­vic­ing and home­owner’s as­so­ci­a­tion fees that must be con­sid­ered. In ad­di­tion, sell­ing and buy­ing pri­vate real es­tate in­volve agents who charge a com­mis­sion. For ex­am­ple, for non-landed pri­vate prop­erty, sell­ers pay an av­er­age of 2 per cent com­mis­sion. This will de­crease the 10-year re­turn from 53 per cent down to 50 per cent, a re­duc­tion more than the sticker amount of 2 per cent due to com­pound­ing.</p>
    <p>An­other ar­gu­ment from pro­po­nents of real es­tate in­vest­ing typ­i­cally ar­gue to just hold on to the as­set for a while so that no losses are re­alised. Therein lies a fal­lacy.</p>
    <p>Just be­cause gains or losses are not re­alised does not mean they do not ex­ist. In the ab­sence of large trad­ing fric­tions, in­vestors should re­act the same way to re­alised and un­re­alised gains and losses.</p>
    <p>But in prac­tice, this isn’t true. A study in be­havioural eco­nomics and finance spear­headed by No­bel prize win­ner Richard Thaler at the Univer­sity of Chicago l ooks at these types of fal­la­cies that gen­er­ate pre­dictable price pat­terns.</p>
    <p>One spe­cific ex­am­ple of this fal­lacy is the dis­po­si­tion ef­fect, the ten­dency of in­vestors to hold los­ing in­vest­ments too long and sell win­ning in­vest­ments too soon. Dis­ci­plined and quan­ti­ta­tive traders can ex­ploit such pre­dictable be­hav­iour to gen­er­ate con­sis­tent re­turns.</p>
    <p>So why the ob­ses­sion with pri­vate real es­tate? One an­swer is lever­age.</p>
    <p>Real es­tate is one of the few se­cu­ri­ties that you can pur­chase for in­vest­ment with only a 25 per cent down pay­ment and bor­row­ing the re­main­ing 75 per cent in or­der to finance the port­fo­lio, equiv­a­lent to a 4x lever­age on the eq­uity put into the pur­chase.</p>
    <p>This means even a 1 per cent in­crease in the value of the real es­tate trans­lates to a 4 per cent in­crease for the ini­tial in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>Sea­soned in­vestors who pur­chase and flip prop­er­ties do not pay down the mort­gage much and can main­tain a high lever­age ra­tio by ro­tat­ing into new pur­chases and out of ex­ist­ing po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>SO WHAT MAKES PRI­VATE REAL ES­TATE SPE­CIAL?</p>
    <p>In a ra­tio­nal world, illiq­uid as­sets – those that can­not be quickly con­verted into cash – would trade at a lower price as in­vestors con­sider the sit­u­a­tion where they quickly need cash but can­not liq­ui­date.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there is one sit­u­a­tion where the illiq­uid­ity of pri­vate real es­tate may be ben­e­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>In this world with im­per­fect in­vestors who have self-dis­ci­pline prob­lems, hold­ing on to the as­set dur­ing tem­po­rary bad times and ig­nor­ing the pub­lic mar­ket sig­nals may be ben­e­fi­cial. Just in­creas­ing the hold­ing power for in­vestors to stay in­vested longer is the key.</p>
    <p>In this case, the com­mon wis­dom to hold on and avoid un­re­alised losses is not a fal­lacy as it would be in a ra­tio­nal world, but is in­deed wis­dom in a be­havioural world.</p>
    <p>How­ever, this ap­plies to in­vest­ing in any as­set. Long-term in­vestors should also not re­act much to short-term mar­ket move­ments. But we don’t seem to have such “com­mon wis­doms” for eq­uity mar­kets. When eq­uity mar­kets lose 20 per cent, ar­ti­cles get writ­ten all around the world call­ing for peo­ple to liq­ui­date their po­si­tions and “avoid the big one”.</p>
    <p>So, if peo­ple ask me now what makes real es­tate spe­cial, it seems quite ob­vi­ous to me. Be­yond the lever­age, it is the in­vestors.</p>
