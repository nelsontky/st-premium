    <p>There are 59 core poses and move­ments in the clas­sic Thai dance Thep­panom. For nearly 20 years, Thai dancer-chore­og­ra­pher Pichet Klunchun has ques­tioned what a 60th el­e­ment would look like.</p>
    <p>“When you study tra­di­tional dance, most of the time you are re­mem­ber­ing,” says the 50-year-old over Zoom from Bangkok. “You just fol­low, copy the master and pro­tect the cul­ture. In 2001, I be­gan to ques­tion my dance. I wanted not just to re­mem­ber it, but to un­der­stand it.”</p>
    <p>To him, No. 60 is not so much a pose, but a “con­cept of move­ment and iden­tity – a free­dom of mind and free­dom of body”.</p>
    <p>No. 60 was meant to have its Sin­ga­pore pre­miere at this year’s da:ns fes­ti­val, but this had to be post­poned due to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the fes­ti­val will be pre­sent­ing a com­mis­sioned mini-doc­u­men­tary, The In­ter­mis­sion Of No. 60, which goes be­hind the scenes with Klunchun as he re­flects on his artistic prac­tice dur­ing lock­down.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing an in­ter­mis­sion, the dancer is more re­laxed,” says Klunchun. “They can talk and have fun, but deep in­side, they must still main­tain the en­ergy to go out and per­form again.”</p>
    <p>The lock­down meant that he could spend more time with his fam­ily, says Klunchun, who is mar­ried with an eight-year-old daughter. “This is the first time in 20 years I have stayed home for a con­tin­u­ous two months.”</p>
    <p>One can reach more peo­ple dig­i­tally, he says, but it is harder to truly con­nect with them. “The film is wider,” he says. “But the dance pro­duc­tion reaches the au­di­ence more deeply.”</p>
