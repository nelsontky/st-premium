    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The top US in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cial stepped up the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s harsh at­tacks on Beijing, la­belling China the big­gest threat to democ­racy and freedom world­wide since World War II and say­ing it was bent on global dom­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>“The in­tel­li­gence is clear: Beijing in­tends to dom­i­nate the US and the rest of the planet eco­nom­i­cally, mil­i­tar­ily and tech­no­log­i­cally,” Di­rec­tor of Na­tional In­tel­li­gence John Rat­cliffe said on Thurs­day in an opin­ion ar­ti­cle on the Wall Street Journal web­site.</p>
    <p>Mr Rat­cliffe, a for­mer Re­pub­li­can con­gress­man ap­pointed by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump to the top US spy job last spring, said China posed “the great­est threat to Amer­ica to­day, and the great­est threat to democ­racy and freedom world­wide since World War II”.</p>
    <p>He said he had shifted re­sources within the US$85 bil­lion (S$113 bil­lion) an­nual fed­eral bud­get al­lo­cated to in­tel­li­gence to in­crease the fo­cus on China.</p>
    <p>Mr Rat­cliffe said China’s eco­nomic es­pi­onage ap­proach was three­fold: “Rob, Repli­cate and Re­place.”</p>
    <p>He also said the strat­egy was for Chi­nese en­ti­ties to steal Amer­i­can com­pa­nies’ in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty, copy it and then sup­plant US com­pa­nies in the global mar­ket­place.</p>
    <p>Beijing yes­ter­day lashed out at Mr Rat­cliffe’s claim, call­ing it a “hodge­podge of lies”.</p>
    <p>“(Rat­cliffe) only con­tin­ues to re­peat lies and ru­mours to slan­der and dis­credit China, and wants only to play up the Chi­nese threat,” said Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Hua Chun­y­ing. “I think this is yet an­other hodge­podge of lies that the US gov­ern­ment has been cook­ing up lately.”</p>
    <p>Mr Rat­cliffe’s es­say was the lat­est broad­side against China from the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion as it seeks to ce­ment the out­go­ing Pres­i­dent’s tough-on-China legacy fol­low­ing his Nov 3 elec­tion de­feat.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s ap­proach has taken re­la­tions be­tween the world’s two largest economies to their low­est point in decades and an­a­lysts say it could limit the in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion’s room for ma­noeu­vring in deal­ing with Beijing.</p>
    <p>Mr Rat­cliffe also charged that China had stolen US de­fence tech­nol­ogy to fuel Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s ag­gres­sive mil­i­tary mod­erni­sa­tion plans.</p>
    <p>“The elec­tion is over. Now let’s all be hon­est about China,” Mr Rat­cliffe told Reuters af­ter the ar­ti­cle was pub­lished.</p>
    <p>In his es­say, Mr Rat­cliffe said the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties had “con­ducted hu­man test­ing” on mem­bers of the Chi­nese army “in hopes of de­vel­op­ing sol­diers with bi­o­log­i­cally en­hanced ca­pa­bil­i­ties”. He did not elab­o­rate.</p>
    <p>US-based think-tanks have re­ported that China is giv­ing in­creas­ing im­por­tance to biotech­nol­ogy in its mil­i­tary strat­egy, but they have not re­leased de­tailed re­ports about the kind of test­ing al­leged by Mr Rat­cliffe.</p>
    <p>Mr Rat­cliffe has been ac­cused by Democrats and cur­rent and for­mer in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cials of politi­cis­ing in­tel­li­gence.</p>
