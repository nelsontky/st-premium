    <p>RACE 1 (1,650M)</p>
    <p>8 Art Of Raw has had the ben­e­fit of one run this sea­son, when a closeup sec­ond. He’s ca­pa­ble of go­ing one bet­ter from the good draw with no weight on his back.</p>
    <p>2 Hay Run has been rel­a­tively com­pet­i­tive on the dirt. If he man­ages to use the in­side gate to his favour, he isn’t with­out hope.</p>
    <p>3 Good Run­ners Way, a two-time win­ner, has dropped to Class 5. He bears close watch­ing with cham­pion jockey Zac Purton astride.</p>
    <p>1 Sky Gem has yet to win on the dirt. But he can still be com­pet­i­tive.</p>
    <p>RACE 2 (1,650M)</p>
    <p>6 Dou­ble Take won with plenty in hand in his fi­nal run last sea­son. If he’s held his con­di­tion, he’s a de­cent chance.</p>
    <p>1 Party Ev­ery­day is look­ing for a hat-trick. He’s taken his rac­ing to the next level.</p>
    <p>8 Lucky Win Win ran a strong third be­hind Party Ev­ery­day last start. He gets a de­cent swing in weight and the in­side draw.</p>
    <p>3 Skyey Supreme hit his straps at the end of last sea­son. He can fig­ure af­ter the nice break.</p>
    <p>RACE 3 (1,000M)</p>
    <p>5 Valiant El­e­gance will have sup­port­ers af­ter his latest trial, which sug­gests that he has the abil­ity.</p>
    <p>1 Fab­u­lous Eight tal­lied five topthree fin­ishes last term over this course and dis­tance, in­clud­ing one win. He has the class.</p>
    <p>2 United We Stand kicked clear by five lengths over this course and dis­tance last prep. But he’s now in Class 4.</p>
    <p>9 Re­gency Poet clearly has abil­ity, but just hasn’t quite been able to piece it to­gether.</p>
    <p>RACE 4 (1,600M)</p>
    <p>3 Mr Aldan crushed his ri­vals by three lengths over this course and dis­tance last start. He rates as a lead­ing player with Purton aboard.</p>
    <p>9 Ever Laugh is a five-time win­ner. He’s a classy vet­eran who is held in good stead by his ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>6 Gift Of Life­line will have come on from his first-up run. It wouldn’t sur­prise to see him add a sec­ond course-and-dis­tance win.</p>
    <p>7 The Hulk can roll for­ward and make his pres­ence felt.</p>
    <p>RACE 5 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>4 Sure Win Win has abil­ity. He de­serves for­give­ness for his de­but run, es­pe­cially as he didn’t look com­fort­able af­ter be­ing crowded through­out.</p>
    <p>2 Bel­uga is a horse on the up. He’s tri­alled well and can achieve backto-back wins. 1 Mon­key Jew­ellery is con­sis­tent. The draw hurts his chances, but he can’t be over­looked with Joao Mor­eira up.</p>
    <p>8 Ex­cel­lent Char­iot is tal­ented. He ap­pears ready to take the next step, although this isn’t the eas­i­est start for his 2020/21 cam­paign.</p>
    <p>RACE 6 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>6 Hap­pily Friends, who tri­alled well, is ca­pa­ble of rolling for­ward from the good draw and pinch­ing this tricky race.</p>
    <p>2 Scores Of Fun won well on de­but last sea­son. The John Size-trained gal­loper was sound in a re­cent trial for his re­turn to rac­ing.</p>
    <p>9 So Awe­some rat­tled into fifth last time over this course and dis­tance. He’ll be fin­ish­ing fast.</p>
    <p>7 Inno Leg­end looks like he has more to give than his re­cent record sug­gests.</p>
    <p>RACE 7 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>3 Sum­street­sumwhere comes into this sec­ond-up, af­ter fin­ish­ing third upon re­sump­tion this sea­son. From Gate 7, he’s ca­pa­ble of fin­ish­ing on top of his ri­vals.</p>
    <p>2 Ul­ti­mate Glory gets a wel­come re­turn to Class 4, where he is a three­time win­ner. Purton will be aboard from a handy gate.</p>
    <p>8 Party Ge­nius is a horse on the up, although he has yet to win. If he’s held last sea­son’s con­di­tion, he’s a top player.</p>
    <p>11 Viva Chef can roll for­ward from Gate 6. He is worth each-way, as his front-run­ning style will give him ev­ery chance.</p>
    <p>RACE 8 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>1 Beauty Spirit is con­sis­tent. He won well in this grade over this course and dis­tance at the end of last sea­son. He tri­alled well. This race looks well within his grasp.</p>
    <p>7 Win Win mixes his form, but should get the right run from Gate 1. He can fig­ure.</p>
    <p>11 Che­va­lier Prince is a horse on the rise. He steps into Class 3 for the first time, which is dif­fi­cult. But he ap­pears to have a num­ber of rat­ing points up his sleeve.</p>
    <p>2 Re­gency Bo Bo can’t be over­looked.</p>
    <p>RACE 9 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>1 Tem­ple Of Heaven grabbed fourth on de­but. He was a classy gal­loper i n Bri­tain, where he was trained by Richard Han­non. He ap­pears to have ac­cli­ma­tised in Hong Kong and is drawn well.</p>
    <p>4 Win­ning Dreamer hasn’t been handed the best of bar­ri­ers. But he is a se­ri­ous tal­ent on the rise.</p>
    <p>9 Ping Hai Bravo is a solid per­former who can make his pres­ence felt with Mor­eira up.</p>
    <p>11 Tele­com Puma is bet­ter than his record sug­gests. He makes his sea­sonal re­turn for new trainer Cas­par Fownes. His best should see him fin­ish around the mark.</p>
    <p>RACE 10 (1,600M)</p>
    <p>4 Lakeshore Ea­gle went to a new level at the end of last sea­son with three con­sec­u­tive wins. He has drawn awk­wardly in Gate 12, but he is a horse on the rise. He has clocked a slick 1min 33.02sec for the Sha Tin mile.</p>
    <p>12 Easy Go Easy Win closed off strongly over an un­suit­able trip first-up this term. This is a dif­fi­cult test, but he has run some solid races over this course and dis­tance.</p>
    <p>2 Savvy Nine couldn’t have been more im­pres­sive in a re­cent trial. He bears close watch­ing.</p>
    <p>10 Ex­cel­lent Pro­posal needed to be at his best again to win first-up from Gate 14 of 14 run­ners. He’ll be find­ing the line late, but the hor­ror gate might be a bit too much for the top spot.</p>
