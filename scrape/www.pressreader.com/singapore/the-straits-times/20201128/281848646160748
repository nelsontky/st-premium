    <p>Sev­eral thou­sand farm­ers trooped into Delhi yes­ter­day to de­mand a re­peal of new laws lib­er­al­is­ing pro­cure­ment of agri­cul­tural pro­duce that they claim ren­ders them vul­ner­a­ble to pri­vate com­pa­nies. The farm­ers moved into the cap­i­tal after the In­dian gov­ern­ment al­lowed them to do so, yield­ing to pres­sure from thou­sands who had amassed at the city’s bor­ders where clashes with the po­lice were re­ported.</p>
    <p>Farm­ers from some north­ern In­dian states, es­pe­cially the key agrar­ian state of Pun­jab, have been mak­ing their way to the cap­i­tal for the past week, brav­ing tear gas, as well as wa­ter can­non, and over­com­ing other ob­sta­cles that the au­thor­i­ties in Haryana, a state that bor­ders Delhi, de­ployed on their route.</p>
    <p>Dra­matic vi­su­als on so­cial me­dia showed farm­ers dis­lodg­ing road bar­ri­cades set up us­ing ship­ping con­tain­ers, sand-laden trucks, ce­ment bar­ri­ers as well as barbed wires. Even trenches were dug by the Haryana au­thor­i­ties to pre­vent the pro­test­ers from de­scend­ing on the cap­i­tal. Many of them were on trac­tors and trol­leys, in­clud­ing some car­ry­ing es­sen­tial sup­plies for their com­rades.</p>
    <p>The use of force to push back the farm­ers, es­pe­cially wa­ter can­non amid the on­go­ing north In­dian win­ter, prompted widespread crit­i­cism. “Sheer ar­ro­gance and brute force is Delhi’s re­sponse, at­tempt to mur­der peace­ful demo­cratic at­tempts to protest and pro­tect liveli­hood,” tweeted Ms Har­sim­rat Kaur Badal, a for­mer fed­eral min­is­ter from Pun­jab who re­signed from the Cab­i­net in Septem­ber to protest against the con­tro­ver­sial re­forms.</p>
    <p>At least one farmer from Pun­jab was killed and two oth­ers in­jured in a road crash yes­ter­day. As the protests gained mo­men­tum, the Delhi po­lice even sought per­mis­sion to use the city’s sta­di­ums as tem­po­rary jails – a re­quest that was de­nied by the lo­cal state gov­ern­ment. The farm­ers have now been al­lowed to stage their protest on the out­skirts of the cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>While the au­thor­i­ties used the Covid-19 pan­demic as a rea­son not to al­low the protest, farm­ers cited re­cent po­lit­i­cal ral­lies in the coun­try to de­mand a sim­i­lar ex­cep­tion.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing leg­isla­tive changes in Septem­ber, farm­ers can now sell their pro­duce any­where, in­clud­ing to cor­po­rate buy­ers, in­stead of just at gov­ern­ment-reg­u­lated whole­sale mar­kets where they are as­sured of a safety net through a min­i­mum pro­cure­ment price (MSP).</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment says the re­forms are nec­es­sary to in­crease agri­cul­tural in­come and pro­duc­tiv­ity. But farm­ers ar­gue the lib­er­alised pol­icy leaves them vul­ner­a­ble to big com­pa­nies who may even­tu­ally dic­tate prices. They also fear the gov­ern­ment could re­move the MSP and say they will con­tinue to protest un­til the re­forms are rolled back.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with the Hin­dus­tan Times daily, fed­eral Min­is­ter of Agri­cul­ture Naren­dra Singh Tomar said he could “nei­ther say yes nor no” to the de­mand by farm­ers for a law to guar­an­tee the MSP.</p>
    <p>He, how­ever, added that the cur­rent pro­cure­ment sys­tem un­der the MSP will con­tinue.</p>
    <p>Mr Tomar has also in­vited farmer lead­ers for talks on Thurs­day and ap­pealed to them not to ag­i­tate.</p>
    <p>But this olive branch has failed to deter the on­go­ing protests.</p>
    <p>Ms Kavitha Ku­ru­ganti, a mem­ber of the co­or­di­na­tion com­mit­tee of the Samyukt Kisan Mor­cha (SKM) that is spear­head­ing the on­go­ing protests, said the gov­ern­ment has not shown “any se­ri­ous­ness” and failed to take note of pre­vi­ous protests across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“Only when the tide has be­come over­whelm­ingly large is the gov­ern­ment re­spond­ing,” she told The</p>
    <p>Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Talks so far be­tween gov­ern­ment and farm­ers’ rep­re­sen­ta­tives have not yielded any­thing con­clu­sive.</p>
    <p>“It is not as though the gov­ern­ment is blink­ing even par­tially on the Acts. All they are do­ing is de­fend­ing them end­lessly... Why will the farm­ers be­lieve the gov­ern­ment is se­ri­ous about hav­ing a di­a­logue with them and lis­ten­ing to their con­cerns? That’s why they have marched,” Ms Ku­ru­ganti said.</p>
    <p>The SKM wrote to Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi yes­ter­day ask­ing for “sin­cere dis­cus­sions” on its de­mands to “re­peal” the leg­is­la­tion.</p>
