    <p>Some of Sin­ga­pore’s top ge­tai singers and hosts will be sell­ing prod­ucts for cor­po­ra­tions dur­ing Hun­gry Ghost Fes­ti­val vir­tual per­for­mances, as a way to make up for a loss of in­come due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, which has forced live ge­tai shows to be can­celled.</p>
    <p>Be­tween their usual song-and­dance or em­cee rou­tines – which have mostly been streamed via Face­book Live dur­ing the pan­demic – ge­tai veter­ans could be, for in­stance, hawk­ing hand cream.</p>
    <p>The per­form­ers say tak­ing on the role of live-stream sales pro­moter is key to their liveli­hood these days.</p>
    <p>Pop­u­lar ge­tai host and singer Lee Peifen, 32, told The Straits Times: “We don’t re­ally have a choice. The good thing is that it can help to keep ge­tai go­ing – in a way.”</p>
    <p>Ge­tais are free concerts that are tra­di­tion­ally staged dur­ing the Hun­gry Ghost Fes­ti­val – which takes place this year from to­day to Sept 16. They can also be or­gan­ised in con­junc­tion with char­ity events or pri­vate func­tions.</p>
    <p>Shows are usu­ally com­mis­sioned by tem­ples or grass­roots or­gan­i­sa­tions. But with crowds not al­lowed since the circuit breaker, only a few or­gan­is­ers see any rea­son to stage them – even vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>Ge­tai singer Sher­raine Law, 27, said she was booked for 80 shows dur­ing the fes­ti­val last year, in­clud­ing mul­ti­ple ses­sions in a day. But so far this year, she has not re­ceived con­fir­ma­tion for any show.</p>
    <p>“Very few shows are be­ing held, and they don’t need to ‘chope’ me so early any­way be­cause every singer has free time now,” she said, us­ing the lo­cal slang for re­serv­ing a spot.</p>
    <p>Pri­vate cor­po­ra­tions have now stepped in to fill the gap, putting to­gether live on­line shows and bank­ing on ge­tai stars’ fame and tal­ent to pro­mote their prod­ucts in be­tween songs and comedy sketches.</p>
    <p>Since June, vet­eran ge­tai host Mar­cus Chin, 66, has been ap­pear­ing on­line, sell­ing every­thing from health sup­ple­ments to fresh seafood via shows on Face­book.</p>
    <p>He usu­ally ap­pears along­side pop­u­lar Tai­wanese ge­tai singer Hao</p>
    <p>Hao, 38, and the pair typ­i­cally switch from belt­ing out Hokkien num­bers to de­liv­er­ing a sales spiel for a bot­tle of vi­ta­mins – and back again – within min­utes.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the Hun­gry Ghost Fes­ti­val, Chin will do this at least three times a week. “You make the most of the sit­u­a­tion,” he said in Man­darin.</p>
    <p>He con­fessed that even with his years of ex­pe­ri­ence in host­ing, sell­ing was an en­tirely dif­fer­ent ball game. “Its not easy to talk about a prod­uct for an hour. I also had to learn about live-stream sales tac­tics, such as or­gan­is­ing on­line lucky draws and giv­ing away free gifts with pur­chases,” he said.</p>
    <p>Lee, who is host­ing 13 shows this sea­son – some with an e-com­merce el­e­ment and some with­out – agreed. Not­ing that she will make only about 35 per cent of her usual earn­ings this sea­son, she said: “These on­line shows are hard truths. You can in­stantly see in the com­ments if the view­ers think you’re do­ing a good job.”</p>
    <p>Vet­eran ge­tai host Liu Lingling, 55, has agreed to do live-stream sales shows but only on the con­di­tion that the com­pa­nies al­low her to be in charge of the show.</p>
    <p>“This way, I can round up my other ge­tai singers and mu­si­cians and in­clude them. They need the work and ex­po­sure too,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully, by next year, things can go back to nor­mal. But for now, we need to adapt to feed our­selves.”</p>
