    <p>WASH­ING­TON • United States Sec­re­tary of De­fence Mark Esper an­nounced on Wed­nes­day an am­bi­tious plan to ex­pand the US Navy with a range of un­manned and au­ton­o­mous ships, sub­marines and air­craft to con­front a grow­ing mar­itime chal­lenge from China.</p>
    <p>The Pen­tagon chief said a sweep­ing re­view of US naval power, dubbed Fu­ture For­ward, had laid out a “game-changer” plan that would ex­pand the US sea fleet to more than 355 ships, from the cur­rent 293.</p>
    <p>The plan, which re­quires adding tens of bil­lions of dol­lars to the US Navy’s bud­get be­tween now and 2045, is aimed at main­tain­ing su­pe­ri­or­ity over Chi­nese naval forces, seen as the pri­mary threat to the US.</p>
    <p>“The fu­ture fleet will be more bal­anced in its abil­ity to de­liver lethal ef­fects from the air, from the sea, and from un­der the sea,” Dr Esper said in a speech at Rand Corp in Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>The ex­pan­sion will add “more and smaller” sur­face ships; more sub­marines; sur­face and sub-sur­face ves­sels that are op­tion­ally manned, un­manned and au­ton­o­mous; and a broad range of un­manned, car­rier-based air­craft.</p>
    <p>The plan is for a fleet of ships more able to sur­vive a high-in­ten­sity con­flict, project US power and pres­ence, as well as de­liver pre­ci­sion strikes at very long dis­tances, he said.</p>
    <p>An ex­am­ple, Dr Esper added, is a new guided mis­sile frigate pro­gramme, pro­duc­ing ships with “in­creased lethal­ity, sur­viv­abil­ity, ca­pa­bil­ity and ca­pac­ity to con­duct dis­trib­uted war­fare”.</p>
    <p>He also said tri­als were un­der way for Sea Hunter, a 40m tri­maran drone that can au­tonomously sur­vey the seas for ri­val sub­marines for more than two months at a time.</p>
    <p>“These ef­forts are the next step in re­al­is­ing our fu­ture fleet, one in which un­manned sys­tems per­form a va­ri­ety of war-fight­ing func­tions, from de­liv­er­ing lethal fire and lay­ing mines, to con­duct­ing re­sup­ply or surveillin­g the en­emy,” Dr Esper said.</p>
    <p>He re­it­er­ated that China is the top US se­cu­rity threat and that the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion is the “pri­or­ity the­atre” for the US mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>“Not only is this re­gion im­por­tant be­cause it is a hub of global trade and com­merce, it is also the epi­cen­tre of great power com­pe­ti­tion with China,” he said.</p>
    <p>A Pen­tagon re­port on the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army re­leased early this month said Bei­jing has the world’s largest naval fleet with 350 ships and sub­marines.</p>
    <p>Still, Dr Esper em­pha­sised, the Chi­nese navy lags in strength and ca­pa­bil­ity. “Even if we stopped build­ing new ships, it would take the PRC years to match our ca­pa­bil­ity on the high seas.”</p>
    <p>Dr Esper said reach­ing the goal of 355 ships means the navy will have to grab a larger per cent of the Pen­tagon bud­get.</p>
    <p>The US will also have to put more re­sources into ex­pand­ing and mod­ernising ship­yards, where China has a clear ad­van­tage.</p>
