    <p>Sin­ga­pore has found jobs and train­ing spots for 33,100 lo­cals through var­i­ous gov­ern­ment ini­tia­tives since May. It had also man­aged to cre­ate 117,500 such op­por­tu­ni­ties for lo­cal job seek­ers by end-Au­gust, sur­pass­ing the Na­tional Jobs Coun­cil’s tar­get. But a num­ber of un­filled va­can­cies still re­main.</p>
    <p>Even in an econ­omy be­set with un­cer­tain­ties and bat­tered by the Covid-19 pan­demic, Sin­ga­pore has man­aged to find jobs and train­ing spots for 33,100 lo­cals through var­i­ous gov­ern­ment ini­tia­tives since May.</p>
    <p>It has also man­aged to cre­ate 117,500 such op­por­tu­ni­ties for lo­cal job seek­ers by end-Au­gust, sur­pass­ing the tar­get to cu­rate 100,000 new jobs, train­ing and at­tach­ment po­si­tions that the Na­tional Jobs Coun­cil had set it­self.</p>
    <p>But a report re­leased yes­ter­day by the Min­istry of Man­power also showed that a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of un­filled va­can­cies still re­mains, sug­gest­ing some mis­match in ex­pec­ta­tions and skills.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to re­porters af­ter a visit to Sam­woh Cor­po­ra­tion’s re­search and de­vel­op­ment cen­tre in Kranji, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said job match­ing could be im­proved and agen­cies will do so.</p>
    <p>“Job match­ing is not straight­for­ward, but if job seek­ers per­sist in their search, they will be able to find some­thing that fits,” he said, in re­sponse to a ques­tion on how these va­can­cies could be filled faster.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo, speak­ing dur­ing a me­dia brief­ing be­fore the visit, said that while there has been good progress in terms of place­ments, the fo­cus now must be to get as many va­can­cies filled as pos­si­ble. But she said they must keep an open mind, as must po­ten­tial em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>“Em­ploy­ers should look be­yond can­di­dates with back­grounds that are an ex­act match to the job,” said Mrs Teo. “Job seek­ers may also be placed more quickly if they are pre­pared to con­sider less fa­mil­iar roles or sec­tors.”</p>
    <p>Of the 117,500 op­por­tu­ni­ties cre­ated un­der the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age, she noted that 82,700 – around 70 per cent – were jobs. Of these, around 73 per cent were long-term jobs.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, fewer peo­ple were be­ing placed into short-term jobs of less than 12 months’ du­ra­tion. Con­versely, 45 per cent were placed in long-term jobs as at endAu­gust, com­pared with 42 per cent as at end-July. “The steady in­crease could be be­cause job seek­ers look­ing for per­ma­nent po­si­tions are more likely to in­vest time in the search process,” said Mrs Teo.</p>
    <p>While a sig­nif­i­cant por­tion of the op­por­tu­ni­ties were be­ing of­fered by the Gov­ern­ment, the pri­vate sec­tor of­fered a ma­jor­ity – 37,290 – of the nearly 60,000 long-term jobs avail­able.</p>
    <p>As at end-Au­gust, the top sec­tors which most work­ers were placed in were in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions, food ser­vices, pro­fes­sional ser­vices, health­care, and fi­nance and in­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>But on a more cau­tious note, the Min­istry of Man­power pointed out that Sin­ga­pore’s res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment rate rose to 4.5 per cent in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>The fig­ure was an in­crease of 0.4 per­cent­age points, slightly higher than the in­crease of 0.3 per­cent­age points in July, when res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment was 4.1 per cent.</p>
    <p>While monthly un­em­ploy­ment rates have so far gen­er­ally re­mained lower than past re­ces­sion­ary highs, they have been grad­u­ally ris­ing, the min­istry added.</p>
    <p>Asked if a higher un­em­ploy­ment rate could be ex­pected in the com­ing months as gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies taper off, Mrs Teo said: “We’re watch­ing it very closely. It’s very hard to fore­tell the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“What we can do, how­ever, is to make sure that even the op­por­tu­ni­ties that are cur­rently avail­able, they con­tinue to be filled as quickly as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said that job seek­ers could seek pro­fes­sional ca­reer guid­ance early to make their job search more ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>“The road to re­cov­ery will con­tinue to take time,” she said. “We will press on to sup­port more suc­cess­ful matches. We also urge job seek­ers and em­ploy­ers to play their part to make this pos­si­ble by stay­ing open to new op­por­tu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>The match­ing of job va­can­cies with em­ploy­ees is not a straight­for­ward process, and the sys­tem will be im­proved, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing to the me­dia at con­struc­tion firm Sam­woh Cor­po­ra­tion’s re­search and de­vel­op­ment cen­tre in Kranji, af­ter the re­lease of the lat­est jobs sit­u­a­tion report by the Min­istry of Man­power.</p>
    <p>One key find­ing of the report was that de­spite the Na­tional Jobs Coun­cil cre­at­ing 117,500 jobs and train­ing and at­tach­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties here – a num­ber which ex­ceeds its orig­i­nal 100,000 tar­get – only 33,100 lo­cal job seek­ers were placed in these roles, lead­ing to a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of un­filled va­can­cies.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing for­ward, I think we need to fur­ther im­prove this match­ing of job va­can­cies to job seek­ers. And this is what the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Cen­tres and other agen­cies will be do­ing,” said Mr Heng, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies and Min­is­ter for Fi­nance.</p>
    <p>The re­view in­cludes look­ing at how the data­base sys­tems avail­able can be bet­ter utilised for the pur­pose of job match­ing, he said.</p>
    <p>“It has not been an easy jour­ney for peo­ple who have lost their jobs. But I’m glad to see that spirit of re­silience, that they keep try­ing,” said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>While the process is not straight­for­ward, if job seek­ers per­sist in their search, they will be able to find some­thing that fits, he said.</p>
    <p>“At the same time, there’s also a whole range of train­ing pro­grammes... (and) a very good suite of pro­grammes to help our peo­ple build new skills,” said Mr Heng, en­cour­ag­ing work­ers to make full use of the schemes.</p>
    <p>He said that while Covid-19 is sig­nif­i­cantly re­shap­ing economies and labour mar­kets around the world, there are growth sec­tors in Sin­ga­pore and job seek­ers should re­main hope­ful.</p>
    <p>“There are new op­por­tu­ni­ties if we change our minds about what are good jobs, and be pre­pared to un­dergo train­ing, be pre­pared to per­se­vere and con­tinue to look for good op­por­tu­ni­ties,” said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>Apart from job seek­ers be­ing will­ing to learn new skills and take on new roles, Mr Heng said that em­ploy­ers need to be flex­i­ble in their ex­pec­ta­tions too.</p>
    <p>In­stead of look­ing for a can­di­date with a par­tic­u­lar back­ground, em­ploy­ers should be pre­pared to in­vest in train­ing the new hires, he said.</p>
    <p>He ac­knowl­edged that it is very dif­fi­cult to find a per­fect fit for job va­can­cies, so both job seek­ers and em­ploy­ers have to be able to adapt and ad­just as they go along.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Heng toured the Sam­woh Re­search and De­vel­op­ment Cen­tre, along with Min­is­ter for Man­power Josephine Teo and Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ters have been mak­ing reg­u­lar vis­its to com­pa­nies in var­i­ous sec­tors to look at how they are far­ing amid the cri­sis and mak­ing ad­just­ments for a post-Covid-19 world.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said: “For the con­struc­tion in­dus­try and built en­vi­ron­ment in­dus­try, it has of­ten been seen as sort of old econ­omy.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, he said there are many op­por­tu­ni­ties for in­no­va­tion to deal with prac­ti­cal prob­lems in the in­dus­try, cit­ing Sam­woh’s ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Sam­woh is look­ing at how it can make fur­ther use of fu­ture tech­nol­ogy in its work, such as ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and data analysis.</p>
    <p>“I think that in­no­va­tive abil­ity is a key com­pet­i­tive edge for Sam­woh and also for our in­dus­try, and this is some­thing which we need to con­tinue to em­pha­sise,” said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>He added that dur­ing this pe­riod, Sam­woh has been de­vel­op­ing its staff and hir­ing new ones.</p>
    <p>“The staff are given good train­ing, and they have a clear idea of what are the skills that they need for the com­pany to­day and into the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>As the Gov­ern­ment fi­nalises the Re­search, In­no­va­tion and En­ter­prise Plan for next year to 2025, it will en­gage with in­dus­try play­ers to see how to cater its plans to fu­ture needs so that firms here can be com­pet­i­tive, said Mr Heng.</p>
