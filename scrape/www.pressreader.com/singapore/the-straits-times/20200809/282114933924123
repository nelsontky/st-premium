    <p>PORT LOUIS • The Prime Min­is­ter of Mau­ri­tius has de­clared a state of en­vi­ron­men­tal emer­gency and ap­pealed to France for ur­gent as­sis­tance as oil from a grounded cargo ship spilled un­abated into the is­land na­tion’s pro­tected wa­ters.</p>
    <p>Rough seas have ham­pered ef­forts to stop fuel leak­ing from the bulk car­rier MV Wakashio, which ran aground two weeks ago, and is pol­lut­ing pris­tine wa­ters in an eco­log­i­cally crit­i­cal marine area off the south-east coast.</p>
    <p>“A state of en­vi­ron­men­tal emer­gency has been de­clared,” Prime Min­is­ter Pravind Jug­nauth posted on his Twit­ter ac­count late Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The tanker, be­long­ing to a Ja­panese com­pany but Pana­ma­ni­an­flagged, was car­ry­ing 3,800 tonnes of fuel when it struck a reef at Pointe d’Esny, an in­ter­na­tion­ally listed con­ser­va­tion site near the turquoise wa­ters of the Blue Bay marine park.</p>
    <p>The Environmen­t Min­istry an­nounced last week that oil had be­gun seep­ing from the hull, as vol­un­teers rushed to the coast to pre­pare for the worst. Soon, oil slicked the co­ral reefs, la­goons and white-sand shores upon which Mau­ri­tius has built its rep­u­ta­tion as a green tourism des­ti­na­tion. Aerial images showed the scale of the dam­age, with huge stretches of azure sea</p>
    <p>Like a boyfriend from hell, he stalked her, abused her and bad­mouthed her to her col­leagues.</p>
    <p>“I can’t live a nor­mal life. When­ever I see a car sim­i­lar to his, I’d feel so scared and trem­ble so much,” the woman wrote on South Korean In­ter­net por­tal Naver, seek­ing ad­vice from lawyers. “I’m go­ing to re­port him.”</p>
    <p>An­other woman posted pho­tos of her friend’s bruised arms and legs and asked for ad­vice on how the friend could seek help.</p>
    <p>Yet an­other woman com­plained that her boyfriend, whom she was co­hab­it­ing with, smashed things in her house and hurt her every time she tried to break up with him.</p>
    <p>“I want to kick him out of my house. I don’t want to live like this any more,” she wrote.</p>
    <p>Such ac­counts of dat­ing vi­o­lence are not un­com­mon in deeply pa­tri­ar­chal South Korea, which ranks among one of the low­est in the world for gen­der equal­ity.</p>
    <p>Nine out of 10 women liv­ing in Seoul who took part in a sur­vey in 2018 ad­mit­ted that they had been abused and hurt, either phys­i­cally or psy­cho­log­i­cally, by their male part­ners dur­ing dat­ing.</p>
    <p>Women used to suf­fer in si­lence, fear­ful of reper­cus­sions. But now, em­bold­ened by the global #Me­Too move­ment against sex­ual ha­rass­ment, they are start­ing to speak out.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of cases of dat­ing vi­o­lence rose to 19,940 last year, up from 14,136 in 2017, the Na­tional Po­lice Agency has said.</p>
    <p>About half of the as­sailants were booked, on charges such as as­sault (7,003 cases), con­fine­ment and in­tim­i­da­tion (1,067), sex­ual vi­o­lence (25) and mur­der (10). The rest of the cases ended up with either po­lice warn­ings or were re­solved pri­vately.</p>
    <p>Su­per­in­ten­dent Tak Kwang-o told The Sun­day Times that an an­nual po­lice cam­paign against dat­ing vi­o­lence has suc­cess­fully raised pub­lic aware­ness and en­cour­aged more women to re­port their abusers.</p>
    <p>He said the cam­paign was first in­tro­duced in 2016 to ad­dress an emerg­ing so­cial phe­nom­e­non of con­flicts be­tween lovers, some of which in­volved celebri­ties.</p>
    <p>Hip-hop singer Iron, for one, was charged with as­sault­ing his girl­friend in 2016. He was even­tu­ally sen­tenced in 2018 to eight months in prison, two years of pro­ba­tion, and 80 hours of com­mu­nity ser­vice.</p>
    <p>K-pop star Goo Ha-ra, on the other hand, sued her boyfriend for as­sault and black­mail; he re­ceived an 18-month jail term last year.</p>
    <p>Supt Tak said the po­lice are do­ing more to raise aware­ness about dat­ing vi­o­lence, such as by putting up cam­paign ban­ners at malls, beauty sa­lons, cafes and other places fre­quented by women, as well as on pop­u­lar Web portals and so­cial me­dia web­sites. stained inky black by the spill.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Mit­sui O.S.K Lines, which op­er­ates the ves­sel owned by an­other Ja­panese com­pany, said fuel was be­ing air­lifted by he­li­copter from the stricken bulker to shore, but poor weather was com­pli­cat­ing mat­ters.</p>
    <p>“We tried to place a con­tain­ment boom near the ship, but it’s not work­ing well due to high waves,” he told Agence France-Presse in</p>
    <p>Work­shops are also con­ducted within the po­lice force to teach of­fi­cers how to crack down on such abuse and pro­tect vic­tims, although these have gone online this year due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The po­lice cam­paign des­ig­nates July and Au­gust as an “in­ten­sive re­port­ing pe­riod”.</p>
    <p>Supt Tak ex­plained that the two sum­mer months draw about 30 per cent more re­ports than other times of the year, as cou­ples en­gage in more out­door ac­tiv­i­ties and go on va­ca­tion to­gether, lead­ing to more pos­si­ble con­flicts that can trig­ger abu­sive be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>The higher tem­per­a­tures can also cause tem­pers to flare more eas­ily and lower one’s abil­ity for self-re­straint, he added.</p>
    <p>“We are fo­cus­ing on re­port­ing be­cause it can raise aware­ness and make peo­ple re­alise it is a crime and not a per­sonal prob­lem. It also</p>
    <p>Tokyo yesterday. Some of the fuel was in sep­a­rate tanks and may not be at risk of leak­ing, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Jug­nauth, af­ter tour­ing the dis­as­ter site, ex­pressed fears the cri­sis could worsen with bad weather fore­cast over the week­end, and made an ur­gent ap­peal for help.</p>
    <p>“We don’t know what will hap­pen to the boat,” he said. He added that “the sink­ing of the Wakashio rep­re­sents a dan­ger for Mau­ri­tius. Our plays a role in pre­vent­ing more se­ri­ous crime that can arise from dat­ing vi­o­lence,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said dat­ing vi­o­lence is a rel­a­tively new phe­nom­e­non in the coun­try, and there are no spe­cific laws tar­get­ing it yet. Anti-stalk­ing Bills have been stuck in the male­dom­i­nated Par­lia­ment for years, and ac­tivists have been call­ing for more to be done to pro­tect women.</p>
    <p>Ms Kim Da-seul from the Korea Women’s Hot­line said 17.6 per cent of the roughly 2,000 calls it re­ceived last year were about abu­sive dat­ing re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>The term “dat­ing vi­o­lence” did not ex­ist when the hot­line was founded in 1983, she added. Vi­o­lence against women aris­ing from in­ti­mate re­la­tion­ships started gain­ing at­ten­tion in the 1990s, but it was only in the past few years that peo­ple ral­lied against dat­ing vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>Ms Kim said the hot­line pro­vides coun­selling and emo­tional sup­port to call­ers, as well as in­for­ma­tion about so­cial as­sis­tance. It also rec­om­mends le­gal ad­vice if needed.</p>
    <p>“Some­times it is hard to un­der­stand what is dat­ing vi­o­lence be­cause it can be per­ceived as a mere fight be­tween two lovers,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Most vic­tims have al­ready tried their best to re­solve the prob­lem but re­alise there is no way out. That’s why they call for coun­selling, be­cause they need ex­ter­nal help. We will as­sure them that the sit­u­a­tion is not their fault, and that it’s not be­cause of what they did or did not do.”</p>
    <p>Lawyers ad­vise that be­fore mak­ing a re­port, vic­tims should gather hard ev­i­dence against their as­sailants, such as abu­sive text mes­sages, med­i­cal re­ports and closed­cir­cuit tele­vi­sion footage.</p>
    <p>Supt Tak said the po­lice would is­sue writ­ten warn­ings to the as­sailants as a form of de­ter­rence, and also keep a record of the abu­sive be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>“The warn­ing is an ef­fec­tive way to raise aware­ness and makes the vic­tim feel that she is not alone, that the gov­ern­ment is be­hind her.”</p>

    <p>I can’t live a nor­mal life. When­ever I see a car sim­i­lar to his, I’d feel so scared and trem­ble so much... I’m go­ing ’’ to re­port him.</p>

    <p>In a state­ment yesterday, the French em­bassy in Mau­ri­tius said a mil­i­tary air­craft from the nearby French In­dian Ocean is­land of Re­union would make two ro­ta­tions over the area with pol­lu­tion-con­trol equip­ment.</p>
