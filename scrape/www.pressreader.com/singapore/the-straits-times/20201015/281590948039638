    <p>Me­di­a­corp has fi­nally put up for sale the sprawl­ing site that for­merly housed the Calde­cott Broad­cast Cen­tre in An­drew Road. Span­ning 752,015 sq ft, the site could ac­com­mo­date 67 bun­ga­low plots, sub­ject to ap­proval. The sale, via a public ten­der ex­er­cise, will close on Dec 9.</p>
    <p>Me­di­a­corp has fi­nally put up for sale the sprawl­ing site that for­merly housed the Calde­cott Broad­cast Cen­tre in An­drew Road.</p>
    <p>The sale, via a public ten­der ex­er­cise, will close on Dec 9.</p>
    <p>Span­ning 752,015 sq ft, the site served as the broad­cast hub for more than six decades un­til 2015, when Me­di­a­corp re­lo­cated to the Me­di­apo­lis in one-north.</p>
    <p>The me­dia or­gan­i­sa­tion was granted an out­line ap­proval by the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Author­ity (URA) to re­de­velop the site, lo­cated in the Calde­cott Hill good class bun­ga­low (GCB) area, into two-storey bun­ga­lows with a min­i­mum land area of 800 sq m per house.</p>
    <p>It ap­pointed an ar­chi­tect to work out a sub­di­vi­sion scheme for the 7ha site, ac­com­mo­dat­ing 67 bun­ga­low plots, sub­ject to ap­proval.</p>
    <p>GCBs are de­tached houses lo­cated within one of the 39 des­ig­nated zones and have a min­i­mum land area re­quire­ment of 1,400 sq m.</p>
    <p>But there can be houses within these des­ig­nated ar­eas which do not meet the min­i­mum size.</p>
    <p>The site, cur­rently zoned for civic and com­mu­nity in­sti­tu­tion use un­der the URA’s Mas­ter Plan 2019, will have to be re­zoned to res­i­den­tial use, which will en­tail pay­ment of a dif­fer­en­tial pre­mium (DP) to the state.</p>
    <p>The lease­hold site cur­rently has a bal­ance lease term of 73 years, which means the devel­oper would also need to pay a lease up­grad­ing pre­mium (UP) to the Sin­ga­pore Land Author­ity for the lease to be ex­tended to a fresh 99-year ten­ure.</p>
    <p>An ap­pli­ca­tion has been made for an in-prin­ci­ple ap­proval for the lease to be ex­tended.</p>
    <p>Mr Karamjit Singh, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Show­suite Con­sul­tancy, one of the two con­sul­tants ap­pointed to ad­vise and mar­ket the prop­erty, said: “The gross land value for a pro­posed bun­ga­low re­de­vel­op­ment on site is ex­pected to be in ex­cess of $400 mil­lion in­clud­ing DP and UP, which would trans­late to a land rate in the re­gion of $540 per sq ft. The net land value could be in ex­cess of $260 mil­lion.”</p>
    <p>Based on the pro­posed scheme of 67 bun­ga­lows, the land cost would work out to about $6 mil­lion per land plot.</p>
    <p>At this price, a devel­oper may break even at about $9 mil­lion to $10 mil­lion per bun­ga­low.</p>
    <p>The de­tached houses are ex­pected to be priced be­tween $11 mil­lion and $14 mil­lion, sub­ject to de­sign and con­fig­u­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>“These ‘junior GCBs’ would cater to the un­der­served mid-tier seg­ment of de­tached houses – the mar­ket be­tween GCBs and en­try-level bun­ga­lows,” Mr Singh said.</p>
    <p>“There has been no large-scale project of brand-new GCBs, junior or con­ven­tional, for a very long time.</p>
    <p>The clos­est proxy would be bun­ga­lows at Sen­tosa Cove, which were launched be­tween 2005 and 2010. As a re­sult, the num­ber of de­tached houses in Sin­ga­pore has re­mained stag­nant over decades.</p>
    <p>“It was 10,000 plus 25 years ago and it re­mains 10,000 plus to­day. This rep­re­sents less than 1 per cent of the coun­try’s to­tal hous­ing stock. Dur­ing the same pe­riod, the av­er­age house­hold net wealth has in­creased by over 300 per cent,” Mr Singh said.</p>
    <p>Mr Michael Tay, head of cap­i­tal markets, Sin­ga­pore, at CBRE, the other con­sul­tant to the project, said: “There is a grow­ing gen­er­a­tion of buy­ers who see the more af­ford­able lease­hold prop­er­ties as an op­por­tu­nity to tie down less cap­i­tal for their homes, while achiev­ing their as­pi­ra­tional goals.</p>
    <p>“In so do­ing, they free up cap­i­tal to in­vest in an­other prop­erty for rental income.”</p>
    <p>He added: “In ad­di­tion to the bun­ga­low re­de­vel­op­ment po­ten­tial, we un­der­stand that URA may also be pre­pared to con­sider a pro­posal for the site to be re­de­vel­oped into a re­tire­ment vil­lage, sub­ject to de­tailed eval­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>But Mr Singh said: “Buy­ers seek­ing to con­vert the prop­erty to a re­tire­ment vil­lage would need to con­sult and sub­mit a pro­posal to the plan­ning au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“That said, we do be­lieve the prop­erty would likely be re­de­vel­oped into bun­ga­lows as there are more hous­ing de­vel­op­ers than re­tire­ment vil­lage in­vestors.”</p>
