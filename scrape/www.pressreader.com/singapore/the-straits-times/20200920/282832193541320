    <p>The do­na­tion of un­sold food that is still safe for eat­ing plays a key role in the char­i­ta­ble re­dis­tri­bu­tion of so­cial re­sources in Sin­ga­pore. Even be­fore the coro­n­avirus pan­demic struck, there was a vul­ner­a­ble seg­ment of so­ci­ety that de­pended on access to free food to sup­ple­ment its needs. Those needs could not but have been ex­ac­er­bated by a dis­ease that is eat­ing into the fab­ric of eco­nomic life. More than ever, the less for­tu­nate could ben­e­fit from the car­ing largesse of busi­nesses that play the role of the Good Sa­mar­i­tan in con­tem­po­rary so­ci­ety. How­ever, there is a need to strike a bal­ance be­tween fa­cil­i­tat­ing food do­na­tion and en­sur­ing that food donors and food dis­trib­u­tors ex­er­cise due care and prac­tise good hy­giene when distribut­ing food. Guide­lines ex­ist on the proper han­dling and re­dis­tri­bu­tion of un­sold and ex­cess food to ad­dress food safety con­cerns.</p>
    <p>The pos­si­bil­ity of a law that could al­lay busi­ness con­cerns about li­a­bil­ity is­sues from the do­na­tion of un­sold food would be a con­crete con­tri­bu­tion to achiev­ing the bal­ance be­tween fa­cil­i­tat­ing do­na­tions and the safety for re­cip­i­ents. The planned tabling of the Good Sa­mar­i­tan Food Do­na­tion Act by MP Louis Ng, through a Pri­vate Mem­ber’s Bill, would give leg­isla­tive force to the main­te­nance of the bal­ance. The is­sue draws at­ten­tion also to the shame­ful waste of food – some 744,000 tonnes of food waste was gen­er­ated last year.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to an es­ti­mate, about 40 per cent of the food waste is from com­mer­cial and in­dus­trial premises such as food man­u­fac­tur­ers, cater­ers, sup­pli­ers and whole­salers. Th­ese fig­ures point to a so­cial ill in a coun­try de­pen­dent largely on food im­ports. Un­sold food that is fit for con­sump­tion and is de­liv­ered safely to re­cip­i­ents will not go to waste. In­stead, it will help shore up Sin­ga­pore against the vi­cis­si­tudes of for­tune in which the pan­demic is a re­minder of the fun­da­men­tal im­por­tance of food se­cu­rity to the vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
