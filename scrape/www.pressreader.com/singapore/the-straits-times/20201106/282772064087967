    <p>• The United States was on a knife-edge on Wed­nes­day wait­ing for elec­toral re­sults, but the fate of one can­di­date was clear.</p>
    <p>En­ter­tainer Kanye West will not win the pres­i­den­tial race this year – but he still has fu­ture as­pi­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>The mer­cu­rial rap­per, who de­cided to run for the na­tion’s high­est of­fice late in the game as an in­de­pen­dent can­di­date un­der the Birthday Party, re­ceived about 60,000 votes from the 12 states where he man­aged to get on the bal­lot.</p>
    <p>His num­bers were less than a pin drop in a ra­zor-thin pres­i­den­tial race, with Demo­cratic can­di­date Joe Bi­den hold­ing the slimmest of leads over Repub­li­can in­cum­bent Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump as many bal­lots were still be­ing counted in key states.</p>
    <p>The hip-hop star and fash­ion de­signer saw his high­est num­bers in Ten­nessee, where about 10,000 peo­ple cast their bal­lots for West, ac­cord­ing to The New York Times.</p>
    <p>The mogul, who once voiced ar­dent sup­port for Mr Trump, made a so­cial me­dia show of cast­ing his own bal­lot in Wy­oming, say­ing it was his first.</p>
    <p>West, 43, wrote him­self in on the bal­lot in the west­ern state, where he failed to qual­ify to have his name on the ticket.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the pic­ture the rap­per posted of his bal­lot, he did not par­tic­i­pate i n any of the con­gres­sional or lo­cal races.</p>
    <p>“Today, I am voting for the first time in my life for the Pres­i­dent of the United States and it’s for</p>
    <p>some­one I truly tweeted West.</p>
    <p>Later, he ap­peared to con­cede de­feat while hint­ing at a fu­ture run, tweet­ing “Kanye 2024”.</p>
    <p>Big Brook­lyn, a 31-year-old rap­per and mu­sic pro­ducer, said in Times Square he had voted for West – and said who be­comes the pres­i­dent is less im­por­tant than vow­ing to push the fu­ture leader to lis­ten.</p>
    <p>But more broadly, the cam­paign</p>
    <p>trust... me,”</p>
    <p>by West, who suf­fers from bipo­lar dis­or­der, raised more ques­tions than en­thu­si­asm.</p>
    <p>West, hus­band of re­al­ity tele­vi­sion star Kim Kar­dashian West, long ago broke ranks with most of the left-lean­ing en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try to loudly voice his sup­port for Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>But last year, he said his sup­port for Mr Trump had been a way to razz the Democrats.</p>
