    <p>LON­DON • It was Sun­day morn­ing, the fourth day of Lon­don Fash­ion Week, and as sun­light streamed through the vaulted sky­lights of the Vic­to­ria Miro art gallery in East Lon­don, Vic­to­ria Beck­ham was pre­par­ing to un­veil her latest col­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>There was no run­way, how­ever, or front row or back­stage scrum. Like all but two of the de­sign­ers show­ing as part of a pared-back sched­ule here, Beck­ham had dis­pensed with a fash­ion show.</p>
    <p>In­stead, she wel­comed three jour­nal­ists at a time, all wear­ing match­ing VB-branded striped silk masks pro­vided at the door, as she talked through just 20 looks that hung on nearby clothes rails.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral weeks ago, she said, the ten­ta­tive plan had been to host a sa­lon pre­sen­ta­tion like the ones she held in New York in the ear­li­est days of her brand.</p>
    <p>But af­ter Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son an­nounced new coronaviru­s re­stric­tions that banned gath­er­ings larger than six peo­ple (bar­ring a hand­ful of ex­cep­tions, in­clud­ing the English coun­try pur­suit of grouse shoot­ing), she had re­turned to the draw­ing board.</p>
    <p>“Still, I’ve al­ways felt the best way to re­ally see fash­ion is up close,” Beck­ham said, smil­ing as she leafed through items such as vin­tage-style high-waist j eans with wide legs, frilled knitwear sep­a­rates in shades of “ba­nana” and su­per-long tai­lored pants i n “hol­landaise”, pal­ette names i nspired by the cook­ing hobby her hus­band, former foot­ball star David Beck­ham, had de­vel­oped dur­ing lock­down.</p>
    <p>“Next sea­son, per­haps we will get back to some­thing a bit more nor­mal,” she said. “But show­ing the col­lec­tion to you like this feels so much more in­ti­mate and ap­pro­pri­ate for this moment. Lock­down gave me a moment to pause, think and re­mem­ber why I fell in love with mak­ing clothes in the first place.”</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar sen­ti­ments could be heard in other stu­dios, gal­leries and ho­tels across Lon­don. In re­cent years, the fash­ion-week carousel has spun madly, push­ing the busi­ness al­most per­ma­nently off bal­ance with the pace of re­lent­less new­ness it de­manded.</p>
    <p>Now, in Lon­don any­way, it had been forced to stop. In­ter­est­ingly, no one ap­peared to miss the fash­ion shows, not for now any­way.</p>
    <p>In their place were scores of videos and dig­i­tal pre­sen­ta­tions, stag­gered and streamed on the Lon­don Fash­ion Week web­site on a tight dig­i­tal sched­ule that tried to mir­ror the way things had once been done.</p>
    <p>For a hand­ful of ed­i­tors and buy­ers, af­ter sign­ing a med­i­cal dec­la­ra­tion form, dos­ing up on hand sani­tiser and sub­mit­ting to a tem­per­a­ture read­ing, de­sign­ers in masks were on hand, shar­ing can­did sto­ries about how lock­down had re­shaped their lives and busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Few ap­peared keen to dwell on any dark­ness. In­stead, most seemed de­ter­mined to move on­ward, conscious that while beauty is not a solution, it can still be a balm.</p>
    <p>Os­man Youse­fzada built a scaled­back col­lec­tion out of his sig­na­ture drap­ing and tai­lor­ing and a new blue­print for his busi­ness, us­ing “last yards” of fab­ric and ar­ti­sanal com­mu­ni­ties in In­dia and Pak­istan to whom he would pay a pro­por­tion of pro­ceeds from sales.</p>
    <p>Emilia Wick­stead con­tin­ued to pre­cisely plot an el­e­gant course via la­dy­like sep­a­rates – tai­lored maxiskirts, bralettes and ber­muda shorts – in block pinks, yel­lows and ochers or i nky sail­boat prints in­spired by Faery Lands Of The South Seas, a 1920s travel diary.</p>
    <p>As the week pro­gressed, how­ever, it be­came im­pos­si­ble to for­get that for thou­sands in fash­ion, this re­mains a fright­en­ing time. Lon­don is home to a vi­brant spring of tal­ent that sur­faces from its fash­ion schools.</p>
    <p>This sea­son felt lesser without their run­way shows filled with the kicky, fear­less ex­u­ber­ance of youth, even though some still pre­sented on the dig­i­tal cal­en­dar.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral de­sign­ers who hosted ap­point­ments, Beck­ham among them, have laid off em­ploy­ees since March. All said they had scaled back their col­lec­tions.</p>
    <p>Pity, too, the free­lance make-up artists, driv­ers, se­cu­rity guards and pho­tog­ra­phers for whom fash­ion weeks are usu­ally a life­line.</p>
    <p>This sea­son, there were no par­ties, back­stage scenes or gath­er­ings of stylish masses on side­walks.</p>
    <p>“It is re­ally tough out there right now,” said Ms Anna Stok­land, a pho­tog­ra­pher lin­ger­ing out­side God­dard’s stu­dio, who of­ten re­lies on street-style shots to boost her earn­ings. Ev­ery 20 min­utes or so, a lone masked vis­i­tor would ar­rive or leave the build­ing. Then, the wait be­gan again.</p>
    <p>“We do what we can, but it feels like the scene we make our money from has sim­ply dis­ap­peared in a swish,” Ms Stok­land said.</p>
    <p>Si­mone Rocha was up­front about the bat­tle for an i nde­pen­dent fash­ion busi­ness to stay the course, par­tic­u­larly when her stu­dio was closed and her stores in Lon­don and New York were shut­tered in the spring.</p>
    <p>But, she said, the adapt­abil­ity shown by her team had wowed and hum­bled her, hard­en­ing her com­mit­ment to them and to her busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Given the imag­i­na­tion and craft poured into the pieces, she was de­ter­mined to have a phys­i­cal pre­sen­ta­tion, which she hosted last Satur­day in the round at a stu­dio on Sav­ile Row.</p>
    <p>“What we do is a trade, but what I do is so tac­tile and tex­tured that I needed to share it in a phys­i­cal way that was safe,” Rocha said.</p>
    <p>“It’s our chal­lenge to see how you can do it in a way that feels right. And ul­ti­mately, to keep mov­ing things for­ward.”</p>
