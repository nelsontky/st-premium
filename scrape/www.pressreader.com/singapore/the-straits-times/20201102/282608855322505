    <p>“This is go­ing to be re­ally hard to ex­plain,” said Bri­tish writer Zadie Smith.</p>
    <p>“Soon it will seem al­most like a mass in­san­ity that, for ex­am­ple, a month be­fore the elec­tion, dur­ing an in­cred­i­bly im­por­tant vi­cepres­i­den­tial de­bate, the (on­line) plat­forms were lit up by the idea of a fly on a man’s head.”</p>
    <p>She was re­fer­ring to last month’s de­bate be­tween United States vice-pres­i­den­tial can­di­dates Mike Pence and Ka­mala Har­ris, dur­ing which a fly rested on Mr Pence’s head and spawned a flood of In­ter­net memes.</p>
    <p>“In 2050, your chil­dren will be say­ing to you – wait, the planet was dy­ing, there was a mas­sive so­cial jus­tice apoc­a­lypse go­ing on racially, there was a mad­man in the White House... and there was a fly?”</p>
    <p>Smith, 45, kicked off the 23rd Sin­ga­pore Writ­ers Fes­ti­val last Fri­day night with a di­a­logue about lan­guage and in­ti­macy, held vir­tu­ally with moder­a­tor Joel Tan.</p>
    <p>The fes­ti­val, or­gan­ised by the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil, runs un­til Sun­day in its first fully dig­i­tal edi­tion with more than 200 pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Smith said it is hard for in­di­vid­ual ci­ti­zens to re­move them­selves from what she terms the “col­lec­tive ma­nia” of In­ter­net plat­forms, but it should be the re­spon­si­bil­ity of writ­ers to take a step back. “They should know a lit­tle bet­ter. Their job is ob­ser­va­tion.”</p>
    <p>The best-sell­ing writer of nov­els such as White Teeth (2000), Or­ange Prize for Fic­tion win­ner On Beauty (2005) and Swing Time (2016) pub­lished a book of six es­says, In­ti­ma­tions, dur­ing the pan­demic and do­nated her roy­al­ties to char­ity.</p>
    <p>She is trou­bled, she said, by the way peo­ple have be­come “em­bed­ded in al­go­rithms” and the vor­tex of so­cial-me­dia ad­dic­tion.</p>
    <p>“I’m do­ing it my­self,” she ob­served. “I waste hours of my life on my lap­top. And when I see my­self hunched over look­ing at non­sense, I try and re­mind my­self: ‘You’re a hu­man be­ing. You’re worth more than this, what­ever this is that you’ve done for the past 4 1/2 hours. Hu­mans like you have done ex­tra­or­di­nary things.</p>
    <p>“‘What are you do­ing right now? What will be gained? Who’s the per­son who’s earn­ing money from it?’ It’s some­one very far away whom I will never see. And I’m be­ing de­graded by this ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>She de­cried how peo­ple have been al­low­ing sec­ondary me­dia to sup­ply them with the lan­guage of thought – for ex­am­ple, how Gmail of­fers to com­plete users’ sen­tences in the “most ba­nal form pos­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>Lan­guage, she cau­tioned, is not an es­sen­tial form and can be ma­nip­u­lated. “You’re given a phrase – ‘cul­tural ap­pro­pri­a­tion’, for ex­am­ple – and you take that phrase as if it’s a fact in the world, the same thing as a rock or a tree.</p>
    <p>“I think some­times we’re a lit­tle in­no­cent in front of lan­guage and we need to have a slightly more an­a­lyt­i­cal un­der­stand­ing that what you are able to think comes out from what you were able to say.”</p>
    <p>Peo­ple’s con­cepts are made out of lan­guage, she said.</p>
    <p>“One role writ­ers have had his­tor­i­cally is to alert peo­ple to ide­ol­ogy dis­guised as na­ture, or to the dream dis­guised as truth.</p>
    <p>“The big­gest re­spon­si­bil­ity of any writer, in my view, is just to say that things could be oth­er­wise. That is the job. You are be­ing told that some­thing is as nat­u­ral as breath­ing. That is not true. That’s all that needs to be said.</p>
    <p>“It is for the peo­ple col­lec­tively to imag­ine this great nar­ra­tive that is some­thing other than what we have.”</p>
