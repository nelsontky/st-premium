    <p>The Na­tional Li­brary Board (NLB) is launch­ing a sub­scrip­tion ser­vice that de­liv­ers to cus­tomers eight cu­rated English chil­dren’s books a month.</p>
    <p>Up to 200 chil­dren from low-in­come fam­i­lies will get the sub­scrip­tion free, as part of a part­ner­ship with The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund (STSPMF).</p>
    <p>The pi­lot ser­vice, called The Lit­tle Book Box, will cost $10.70 a month and run for nine months from next month to July next year.</p>
    <p>Reg­is­tra­tion opens to­day, with a cap of 1,000 slots.</p>
    <p>The book boxes will in­clude fic­tion and non-fic­tion reads and are catered for two age groups – of four to six and seven to nine.</p>
    <p>These will not fall within the sub­scribers’ usual li­brary loan quota.</p>
    <p>The loan du­ra­tion is 21 days, ex­clud­ing de­liv­ery time. Sub­scribers can re­turn the books at any of the 25 pub­lic li­braries. Over­due re­turns will in­cur the usual fines.</p>
    <p>The ser­vice is avail­able on a first come, first served ba­sis, with a min­i­mum sub­scrip­tion pe­riod of three months, fol­low­ing which the sub­scrip­tion will be au­to­mat­i­cally re­newed for another three months un­less it is ter­mi­nated.</p>
    <p>De­pend­ing on the re­sponse to the pi­lot, NLB will con­sider ex­tend­ing and ex­pand­ing the ser­vice be­yond next July.</p>
    <p>NLB chief ex­ec­u­tive Ng Cher Pong said: “Fam­i­lies have busy life­styles and par­ents have to jug­gle work with child­care. Some might find it dif­fi­cult to go to the li­braries to­gether with their chil­dren reg­u­larly.”</p>
    <p>He added that many may also be stay­ing at home more amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures and ca­pac­ity con­trols are still in force at the li­braries, even as they re­sumed reg­u­lar open­ing hours last month.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said: “The Lit­tle Book Box will make it more con­ve­nient and ac­ces­si­ble for par­ents to get a va­ri­ety of books for their chil­dren. We hope this will boost the chil­dren’s love for read­ing and their thirst for knowl­edge and in­for­ma­tion.”</p>
    <p>The 200 stu­dents for the STSPMF free sub­scrip­tion will be se­lected by so­cial ser­vice agen­cies.</p>
    <p>STSPMF chair­man War­ren Fer­nan­dez, who is ST ed­i­tor and ed­i­torin-chief of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’ English/Malay/Tamil Me­dia Group, said: “All of us at The Straits Times be­lieve in the power and value of read­ing. Read­ing opens doors to new worlds, peo­ple and ideas.</p>
    <p>“We want to help young Sin­ga­pore­ans to en­joy read­ing and have op­por­tu­ni­ties to do so. This should in­clude those who might not have the means to do so.</p>
    <p>“The ST School Pocket Money Fund is happy to work with NLB to help make this pos­si­ble for some of the fam­i­lies who turn to us for help. We be­lieve this is a mean­ing­ful way for us to mark the fund’s 20th an­niver­sary.”</p>
