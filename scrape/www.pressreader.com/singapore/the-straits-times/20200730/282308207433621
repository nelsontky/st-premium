    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong’s econ­omy con­tracted for the fourth straight quar­ter as the coron­avirus pan­demic and po­lit­i­cal ten­sions ex­tend the city’s first re­ces­sion in a decade.</p>
    <p>The ter­ri­tory’s econ­omy con­tracted 9 per cent in the se­cond quar­ter from a year ear­lier, ac­cord­ing to an ad­vance reading from the Cen­sus and Statis­tics De­part­ment Hong Kong yes­ter­day. That’s worse than the me­dian fore­cast of -8.3 per cent and fol­lows a re­vised 9.1 per cent drop in the first quar­ter that was the worst dat­ing to 1974 data.</p>
    <p>Re­vised se­cond-quar­ter fig­ures as well as an up­dated fore­cast for GDP growth in 2020 will be re­leased on Aug 14, ac­cord­ing to the gov­ern­ment re­port.</p>
    <p>“Lo­cally, the re­cent surge in Covid-19 cases has clouded the near-term out­look for do­mes­tic eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity,” the gov­ern­ment said in the re­lease. “Nonethe­less, once the lo­cal epi­demic is con­tained again and ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment con­tin­ues to im­prove, the Hong Kong econ­omy hope­fully will grad­u­ally re­cover in the rest of the year.”</p>
    <p>Hong Kong re­ported 118 ad­di­tional coron­avirus cases yes­ter­day, bring­ing total in­fec­tions to 3,002, De­part­ment of Health of­fi­cial Chuang Shuk-kwan said at a brief­ing.</p>
    <p>The over­all eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion sta­bilised some­what dur­ing the quar­ter, es­pe­cially in May and June when the virus was largely un­der con­trol, the gov­ern­ment said. On a quar­ter-to-quar­ter sea­son­ally ad­justed ba­sis, the econ­omy con­tracted 0.1 per cent in the three months to June.</p>
    <p>Still, Hong Kong’s econ­omy shows few signs of a re­cov­ery af­ter suf­fer­ing re­peated set­backs over the past year. The United States-China trade war and anti-gov­ern­ment protests first pushed the city into re­ces­sion in the se­cond half of 2019. Then the global pan­demic this year eroded what lit­tle tourism re­mained, dec­i­mat­ing the city’s re­tail, food and bev­er­age and hos­pi­tal­ity in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>“As an in­ter­na­tional hub that re­lies on pas­sen­ger and goods flows, this fig­ure sum­marises the sharp con­trac­tion of tourism and the event in­dus­try,” said Mr Ray­mond Ye­ung, greater China chief econ­o­mist with Aus­tralia & New Zealand Bank­ing Group. “As the case num­bers rise again in July and the gov­ern­ment starts to tighten, the out­look for Q3 re­mains very chal­leng­ing. An­other quar­ter of neg­a­tive growth is highly prob­a­ble.”</p>
    <p>This lat­est fall marks four con­sec­u­tive quar­ters of eco­nomic con­trac­tion, equalling the pe­riod af­ter the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis. The cur­rent stretch is only one quar­ter be­hind the long­est re­ces­sion on record, when Hong Kong’s econ­omy shrank for five quar­ters in 1998-1999.</p>
    <p>The city’s un­em­ploy­ment rate has surged to a 15-year high, leav­ing thou­sands job­less and the poor even more vul­ner­a­ble. Re­tail sales likely had a dou­ble-digit fall again in June, ac­cord­ing to fore­casts of data due to­day.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pect many small restau­rants to shut down and un­em­ploy­ment will rise to around 8 per cent,” said Ms Iris Pang, greater China chief econ­o­mist with ING Bank NV. The un­em­ploy­ment rate is cur­rently at 6.2 per cent.</p>
