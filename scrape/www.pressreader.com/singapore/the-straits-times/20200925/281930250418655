    <p>NEW YORK • Ma­jor car­mak­ers Tesla, Volvo, Ford and Mercedes-Benz have sued the US gov­ern­ment over tar­iffs on Chi­nese goods, de­mand­ing cus­toms du­ties paid on im­ports be re­turned, with in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>The law­suits, which were filed in re­cent days in the New York­based Court of In­ter­na­tional Trade, con­cern tar­iffs im­posed by the Of­fice of the US Trade Rep­re­sen­ta­tive on im­ports from China, which Tesla in its fil­ing called “ar­bi­trary, capri­cious, and an abuse of dis­cre­tion”.</p>
    <p>The du­ties came amid a wider trade dis­pute be­tween Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing, and the car­mak­ers are ask­ing for the tar­iffs to be re­voked and any money paid to im­port parts re­turned.</p>
    <p>Mercedes-Benz in its fil­ing ac­cused Wash­ing­ton of “pros­e­cu­tion of an un­prece­dented, un­bounded, and un­lim­ited trade war im­pact­ing over US$500 bil­lion (S$688 bil­lion) in im­ports from the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China”.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man car­maker ar­gued that US law “did not con­fer authority on de­fen­dants to lit­i­gate a vast trade war for how­ever long, and by what­ever means they choose”.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials at the of­fice of United States Trade Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Robert Lighthizer did not re­spond when con­tacted by AFP for com­ments on the law­suits.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion en­gaged in months of trade con­flicts with China, and im­posed the levies as part of an ef­fort to wean US man­u­fac­tur­ers off Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>China and the US signed their “phase one” trade deal ear­lier this year that par­tially ended the dis­pute. Un­der that agree­ment, Bei­jing promised to buy US$200 bil­lion in US goods and Wash­ing­ton backed down on tar­iffs on US$160 bil­lion in Chi­nese goods, par­tic­u­larly con­sumer elec­tron­ics.</p>
    <p>The US also slashed by half 15 per cent tar­iffs on US$120 bil­lion in goods, but kept in place 25 per cent du­ties on US$250 bil­lion in im­ports, which some of the car­mak­ers cited in their law­suits.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has re­tal­i­ated for these levies, while Wash­ing­ton is aim­ing both to re­duce its trade deficit and re­form Chi­nese busi­ness prac­tices it con­sid­ers un­fair. The Com­merce De­part­ment re­ported the US trade deficit in July surged nearly 11 per cent to US$63.6 bil­lion, with the deficit with China climb­ing to US$28.3 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>China is the world’s big­gest car mar­ket and the main growth driver for many car man­u­fac­tur­ers – es­pe­cially for elec­tric car maker Tesla.</p>
