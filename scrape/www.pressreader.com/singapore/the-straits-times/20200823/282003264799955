    <p>SOME DOUBTS OVER LEAD­ER­SHIP</p>
    <p>I be­lieve that the Chi­nese pub­lic will ques­tion Bei­jing from this year’s con­tin­u­ous nat­u­ral and man-made disas­ters, and even ques­tion China’s gov­er­nance model and its ef­fec­tive­ness. ’’</p>
    <p>MR WU QIANG, an in­de­pen­dent po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst in Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>BEI­JING • Hav­ing brought the coro­n­avirus pan­demic largely un­der con­trol, China’s lead­ers are now strug­gling with a surge of crip­pling floods that have killed hun­dreds of peo­ple and dis­placed mil­lions across the cen­tral and south-western parts of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Flood­ing on the Yangtze River peaked again last week, in Sichuan prov­ince and the sprawl­ing me­trop­o­lis of Chongqing, while the Three Gorges Dam, 450km down­stream, reached its high­est level since it be­gan hold­ing water in 2003.</p>
    <p>This year’s flood­ing has un­folded not as a sin­gle nat­u­ral disas­ter, with an enor­mous loss of life and prop­erty, but rather as a slow, mer­ci­less series of smaller ones, whose com­bined toll has steadily mounted even as of­fi­cial re­ports have fo­cused on the gov­ern­ment’s re­lief ef­forts.</p>
    <p>“The Chi­nese na­tion has fought nat­u­ral disas­ters for thou­sands of years, gain­ing pre­cious ex­pe­ri­ence,” Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping de­clared last Tues­day after a visit to An­hui, another flooded prov­ince down­stream from the Three Gorges Dam. “We should con­tinue to fight.”</p>
    <p>Mr Xi called China’s disas­ter re­lief ef­forts “a prac­ti­cal test of the lead­er­ship and com­mand sys­tem of our army”.</p>
    <p>He met the rel­a­tives of three peo­ple who died while fight­ing floods, and last Wednes­day, he ad­dressed of­fi­cers of the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army and the Peo­ple’s Armed Po­lice, which have been in­volved in the re­lief work.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic ap­pear­ances i n flood­stricken ar­eas by Mr Xi and Premier Li Ke­qiang un­der­scored the sever­ity of the cri­sis, which has de­liv­ered another blow to an econ­omy still strug­gling to re­bound from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Li vis­ited Chongqing, where the Yangtze spilled over its banks for the fifth time this year and last Thurs­day after­noon breached the his­tor­i­cal high reached in 1981.</p>
    <p>The lead­ers have tried to re­as­sure peo­ple that the gov­ern­ment was do­ing ev­ery­thing it could, but some might have doubts.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve that the Chi­nese pub­lic will ques­tion Bei­jing from this year’s con­tin­u­ous nat­u­ral and man-made disas­ters, and even ques­tion China’s gov­er­nance model and its ef­fec­tive­ness,” said Mr Wu Qiang, an in­de­pen­dent po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst in Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>One res­i­dent in Chongqing, in a video of the floods cir­cu­lat­ing on a pop­u­lar so­cial me­dia plat­form, said: “The losses have been heavy for many busi­nesses, fight­ing the pan­demic in the first half of the year and flood­ing in the sec­ond half.”</p>
    <p>The floods had al­ready caused at least US$26 billion (S$35.7 billion) in eco­nomic losses be­fore last week.</p>
    <p>At a re­cent brief­ing in Bei­jing, Mr Zhou Xuewen, sec­re­tary-gen­eral of China’s flood con­trol head­quar­ters, said that at least 63 mil­lion peo­ple had been af­fected and 54,000 homes de­stroyed.</p>
    <p>At least 219 peo­ple have died or dis­ap­peared, he said.</p>
    <p>In Sichuan on Fri­day, a land­slide caused by heavy rain killed at least six other peo­ple in a vil­lage near Ya’an. Another in the same re­gion left five peo­ple miss­ing.</p>
    <p>Heavy rain is nor­mal in south­ern China dur­ing the sum­mer, but this year’s has fallen harder and longer than usual, in­un­dat­ing crops and en­tire com­mu­ni­ties over the past two months. Per­haps not co­in­ci­den­tally, Mr Xi an­nounced a cam­paign to fight food waste against the back­drop of the flood­ing, although of­fi­cials have in­sisted that there is no im­pend­ing food cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The heavy rain this year has re­vived a de­bate over the Three Gorges Dam, a mas­sive pro­ject be­gun in 1994 that forced the re­lo­ca­tion of more than one mil­lion peo­ple, in­un­dated en­tire com­mu­ni­ties and badly dam­aged the sur­round­ing en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>The flow of water into the dam’s reser­voir reached 75 mil­lion litres a sec­ond, break­ing a record of 61 mil­lion litres set just last month, ac­cord­ing to a state­ment from the Min­istry of Water Re­sources.</p>
    <p>Although of­fi­cials said the dam was in no dan­ger, the water level has ap­proached max­i­mum ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>Since the floods be­gan in June, of­fi­cials have re­peat­edly of­fered re­as­sur­ances that the dam could with­stand what has been called on­cein-a-cen­tury flood­ing.</p>
    <p>Some state me­dia re­ports have gone fur­ther, claim­ing that the dam had al­most cer­tainly pre­vented even worse flood­ing in ci­ties down­stream, in­clud­ing Wuhan, where the Covid-19 pan­demic be­gan.</p>
