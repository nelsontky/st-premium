    <p>Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob has writ­ten to Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping to con­vey her best wishes on the oc­ca­sion of the 71st an­niver­sary to­day of the found­ing of the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong has also writ­ten to Pre­mier Li Ke­qiang to con­grat­u­late him. Their let­ters were re­leased by Sin­ga­pore’s</p>
    <p>Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>In her let­ter, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah said China has made im­mense progress over seven decades, par­tic­u­larly af­ter the launch of its re­form and open­ing-up pol­icy in 1978.</p>
    <p>It is now the world’s sec­ond­largest econ­omy and a top trad­ing part­ner for many coun­tries, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore. Amid the pan­demic, China has been one of the first coun­tries to con­trol the out­break and re­vive its econ­omy, she wrote.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore-Sino re­la­tions have grown in tan­dem with China’s de­vel­op­ment, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah added, not­ing that this year is the 30th an­niver­sary of the es­tab­lish­ment of di­plo­matic re­la­tions be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“In the short span of thirty years, our bi­lat­eral ties have strength­ened sig­nif­i­cantly and bro­ken new ground in di­verse ar­eas. As we step into a post-Covid-19 world, I am cer­tain that our two coun­tries will con­tinue to work closely to­gether for the mu­tual ben­e­fit of our peo­ples.”</p>
    <p>She added that she and her hus­band looked for­ward to meet­ing Pres­i­dent Xi and his wife Peng</p>
    <p>Liyuan again in Bei­jing dur­ing a forth­com­ing state visit to China.</p>
    <p>In his let­ter, PM Lee said China’s re­mark­able growth over the past decades, lift­ing hun­dreds of mil­lions out of poverty, was tes­ta­ment to the tenac­ity of its peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“Even in an in­creas­ingly un­cer­tain global en­vi­ron­ment, I am con­fi­dent that China will con­tinue to grow and con­trib­ute to the sta­bil­ity and pros­per­ity of our re­gion and the world.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee noted that bi­lat­eral re­la­tions have steadily strength­ened and co­op­er­a­tion be­tween the two coun­tries is sub­stan­tial and am­bi­tious, rang­ing from build­ing in­dus­trial parks to de­vel­op­ing sus­tain­able eco-cities to en­hanc­ing Sin­ga­poreChina con­nec­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Lead­ers on both sides have re­mained in close con­tact dur­ing the pan­demic, and both sides are work­ing on new ar­eas of co­op­er­a­tion in pub­lic health man­age­ment and vac­cine re­search and de­vel­op­ment, he added. Both coun­tries work closely in mul­ti­lat­eral fora too, PM Lee said, and Sin­ga­pore is look­ing for­ward to mark­ing the 30th an­niver­sary of Asean-China re­la­tions next year.</p>
    <p>“We also look for­ward to the con­clu­sion of the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship later this year, which will be a timely af­fir­ma­tion of our joint com­mit­ment to up­hold­ing a rules-based mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing sys­tem.”</p>
