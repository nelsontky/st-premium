    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has cre­ated an op­por­tu­nity for Sin­ga­pore to re-imag­ine its trans­port in­fra­struc­ture, said Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>With the re­duced traf­fic, and the new travel pat­terns it has en­gen­dered, new av­enues can be opened up for peo­ple to com­mute.</p>
    <p>One pos­si­bil­ity is to con­vert un­der-used road space for other uses, such as cy­cling paths.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has also given rise to more sus­tain­able travel pat­terns, with a shift to­wards telecom­mut­ing and stag­gered work­ing hours, said Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>“We will ex­plore ways to make some of th­ese changes per­ma­nent.”</p>
    <p>But the pan­demic has oth­er­wise “in­flicted se­vere dam­age” on the trans­port sec­tor, he said when lay­ing out the Min­istry of Trans­port’s (MOT) plans in an ad­den­dum to the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress.</p>
    <p>He stressed that a key priority is to re­vive Sin­ga­pore’s air hub in a safe man­ner, and that it will use the present down­time to im­prove the avi­a­tion in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>His min­istry is also com­mit­ted to com­plet­ing sev­eral in­fra­struc­ture projects, in­clud­ing the rail net­work ex­pan­sion and the mega Tuas Port.</p>
    <p>“MOT will work with the in­dus­try to tide over the Covid-19 pan­demic, re­vive the Changi air hub, strengthen our sta­tus as a global hub port, and de­liver sus­tain­able and in­clu­sive land trans­port for our home of the fu­ture,” said Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>With the coro­n­avirus pan­demic re­duc­ing traf­fic on the roads and chang­ing com­mut­ing pat­terns, cer­tain un­der-used road lanes can be con­verted to cy­cling and bus lanes, said Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>There may also be scope to pedes­tri­anise cer­tain roads, said Mr Ong, as he set out his min­istry’s plans fol­low­ing the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress.</p>
    <p>“The lower traf­fic and new travel pat­terns brought about by Covid-19 have opened a win­dow of op­por­tu­nity to re-imag­ine our road in­fra­struc­ture,” he said as he sketched out the pos­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Other cities abroad, in­clud­ing Athens in Greece, have moved to re­claim road space for pedes­tri­ans and cy­clists, as the pan­demic al­ters com­mut­ing habits.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter also noted that Covid-19 has led to in­creased adop­tion of telecom­mut­ing and stag­gered work­ing hours.</p>
    <p>“This has led to more sus­tain­able travel pat­terns. We will ex­plore ways to make some of th­ese changes per­ma­nent,” he added.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment will also carry out its plan to ex­pand the cy­cling path net­work from 460km now to 1,320km by 2030.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said th­ese ini­tia­tives will help Sin­ga­pore in its goal to be­come a car-lite na­tion, along with other mea­sures such as a zero ve­hi­cle growth rate and phas­ing out pri­vate ve­hi­cles with in­ter­nal com­bus­tion en­gines by 2040.</p>
    <p>He also out­lined other plans for land trans­port as well as the avi­a­tion and mar­itime sec­tors.</p>
    <p>For land trans­port, he said Sin­ga­pore will con­tinue to work to­wards the vi­sion of a city where 90 per cent of peak-hour jour­neys can be com­pleted within 45 min­utes. Within towns, res­i­dents should be able to reach their near­est neigh­bour­hood cen­tre in 20 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Re­sources will con­tinue to be in­vested in the pub­lic trans­port sys­tem to main­tain re­li­a­bil­ity, he added, while new MRT sta­tions</p>
    <p>The lower traf­fic and new travel pat­terns brought about by Covid-19 have opened a win­dow of op­por­tu­nity to re-imag­ine our road in­fra­struc­ture. and lines will be opened al­most every year.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Trans­port (MOT) will also work with the Pub­lic Trans­port Coun­cil to im­prove pub­lic trans­port to help those with mo­bil­ity chal­lenges, said Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>He added that ex­pand­ing the pub­lic trans­port sys­tem to bet­ter serve Sin­ga­pore­ans re­quires ma­jor in­fra­struc­ture and re­cur­rent ex­pen­di­ture. “But this is es­sen­tial pub­lic spend­ing, which has to be car­ried out with fi­nan­cial pru­dence.”</p>
    <p>On avi­a­tion, he stressed that re­viv­ing the Changi air hub in a safe way is a “top and immediate priority”. Sin­ga­pore will have to take fur­ther steps to re­sume ser­vices for pas­sen­gers care­fully and pro­gres­sively, start­ing with coun­tries or cities which have kept the virus un­der con­trol, he added.</p>
    <p>Since the pan­demic struck, the air­port has lost about 50 per cent of its air links and more than 95 per cent of its sched­uled pas­sen­ger ser­vices. “We can­not take our hub sta­tus for granted and as­sume that we will re­main one when global air travel re­cov­ers,” said Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>While air traf­fic vol­ume is down, Sin­ga­pore will take the op­por­tu­nity to de­velop a three-run­way sys­tem for Changi, he added. It is re­view­ing the Ter­mi­nal 5 project as well.</p>
    <p>MOT will also help avi­a­tion com­pa­nies to pre­serve their core ca­pa­bil­i­ties and re-skill work­ers.</p>
    <p>On mar­itime trans­port, Mr Ong noted that the sec­tor has stayed rel­a­tively re­silient de­spite the dis­rup­tion caused by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mov­ing ahead, Sin­ga­pore will con­tinue to com­plete Tuas Port in the 2040s as planned, he said, while re­main­ing nim­ble i n adapt­ing to trends like shift­ing global sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>As for the Kuala LumpurSin­ga­pore High Speed Rail (HSR), Mr Ong said Sin­ga­pore is in dis­cus­sions with Malaysia on the project, which has been sus­pended at Malaysia’s re­quest till Dec 31.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to be­lieve that the HSR is a mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial project for both coun­tries,” he said.</p>
