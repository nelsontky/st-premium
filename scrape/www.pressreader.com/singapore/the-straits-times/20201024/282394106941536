    <p>BARCELONA • Ronald Koe­man will know Barcelona can plunge Real Madrid into cri­sis to­day, but for him, his first Cla­sico as a coach is more about vin­di­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>In­flict­ing a third con­sec­u­tive de­feat in a week on Madrid at the Nou Camp would create the sort of tur­bu­lence for their op­po­nents that Barca have grown only too used to in re­cent months. But, as much as crank­ing up the pres­sure on Zine­dine Zi­dane and gain­ing an early boost in La Liga’s ti­tle race would be wel­come, Koe­man might claim the big­gest re­wards from a vic­tory.</p>
    <p>Barca’s new coach has over­seen three wins, a draw and a de­feat, mean­ing the tra­jec­tory of his pro­ject is not yet clear. His faith in youth has been en­cour­ag­ing, with Ansu Fati, 17, Fran­cisco Trin­cao, 20, and Pedri, 17, de­liv­er­ing more than ex­pected in at­tack. Fati, who scored again in the Cham­pi­ons League on Tues­day, has ar­guably been their stand­out per­former so far.</p>
    <p>With Fati build­ing on an al­ready im­pres­sive de­but sea­son last year, it would be not be a sur­prise if he is in the start­ing line-up this week­end. But Trin­cao and Pedri would be braver calls.</p>
    <p>The most press­ing is­sue of Koe­man’s ten­ure is An­toine Griez­mann, who is now on his third coach at Barca but still yet to find any­thing close to top form.</p>
    <p>The France for­ward’s prob­lems have not all been of his own mak­ing af­ter be­ing played out of po­si­tion for much of last sea­son.</p>
    <p>But it is be­com­ing in­creas­ingly dif­fi­cult to jus­tify his un­der­whelm­ing per­for­mances and it was telling on Tues­day when Koe­man left him on the bench for the 90 min­utes.</p>
    <p>While the Dutch­man re­fused to be drawn on whether Griez­mann was no longer in favour, say­ing “it means noth­ing for the Cla­sico”, he fired a warn­ing that no one’s place on the team sheet is se­cure.</p>
    <p>“An­toine knows his sit­u­a­tion. The only thing he can do is work hard to change it,” he said.</p>
    <p>A pos­i­tive per­for­mance against Madrid will give Barca mo­men­tum ahead of their trip to Ju­ven­tus in the Cham­pi­ons League next week but, for Koe­man, the ben­e­fits would last even longer.</p>
    <p>Un­like the for­mer Nether­lands man­ager, Zi­dane has credit in the bank, hav­ing won 11 tro­phies across two man­age­rial spells with Real.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a cri­sis is loom­ing on the back of two de­feats in a week.</p>
    <p>Madrid did not make a sin­gle new sign­ing for the first time in 40 years dur­ing the trans­fer win­dow, ow­ing to the fi­nan­cial fall­out from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and many crit­ics are pre­dict­ing this sea­son’s Cla­sico to be the low­est-qual­ity af­fair for some time.</p>
    <p>But, de­spite a less than vin­tage Barca host­ing a frag­ile-look­ing Real side miss­ing Eden Hazard, La</p>
    <p>Liga pres­i­dent Javier Te­bas still con­sid­ers the clash to be the “most im­por­tant club game in the world”.</p>
