    <p>Un­der Ger­ard Houl­lier, Rafa Ben­itez, Roy Hodg­son and Kenny Dal­glish, Liver­pool were of­ten cau­tious and de­fended deep. Rodgers’ more cav­a­lier in­stincts, his quick counter-at­tack­ing, fond­ness for 4-3-3 and up­beat pos­ses­sion game pro­vided some tac­ti­cal build­ing blocks for Klopp.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause I am a Bri­tish man­ager, we prob­a­bly got lucky.” Bren­dan Rodgers was re­flect­ing sar­cas­ti­cally on Le­ices­ter’s 4-1 evis­cer­a­tion of Leeds ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>It be­trayed a sense he feels de­prived of the credit he de­served. A man mocked more for some of his pro­nounce­ments than his man­age­ment could com­plete a grand slam of away wins against much-lauded im­ports to­day.</p>
    <p>Af­ter beat­ing Pep Guardi­ola’s Manch­ester City, Mikel Arteta’s Ar­se­nal and Marcelo Bielsa’s Leeds, he faces Jur­gen Klopp and Liver­pool.</p>
    <p>Rodgers re­mains the only Bri­tish man­ager since Alex Fer­gu­son to get a top-two Premier League fin­ish, but his suc­ces­sor at An­field has achieved what the North­ern Ir­ish­man al­most did in 2014 and ren­dered Liver­pool cham­pi­ons.</p>
    <p>Rodgers’ reign of glo­ri­ous highs and dread­ful lows lends it­self to dif­fer­ent con­clu­sions.</p>
    <p>He both tried to send Jor­dan Hen­der­son to Ful­ham in part-ex­change for Clint Dempsey and made the cur­rent Foot­baller of the Year Liver­pool cap­tain.</p>
    <p>He never wanted Roberto Firmino and picked the player who be­came Klopp’s tal­is­man on the left wing, where he never scored.</p>
    <p>With Joe Gomez and Hen­der­son in­jured, Firmino could be the sole buy in Rodgers’ reign to start for Liver­pool to­day.</p>
    <p>And yet he helped shift the style of play: Un­der Ger­ard Houl­lier, Rafa Ben­itez, Roy Hodg­son and Kenny Dal­glish, Liver­pool were of­ten cau­tious and de­fended deep.</p>
    <p>Rodgers’ more cav­a­lier in­stincts, his quick counter-at­tack­ing, fond­ness for 4-3-3 and up­beat pos­ses­sion game pro­vided some tac­ti­cal build­ing blocks for Klopp, even if his de­fen­sive fail­ings and the ab­sence of the equiv­a­lents of Alis­son and Vir­gil van Dijk ex­plain why his sides fell short.</p>
    <p>The irony, per­haps, is that as Rodgers re­turns to An­field, his ap­proach is more likely to mir­ror Ben­itez’s than Klopp’s. He has not tried to out­play City, Ar­se­nal or</p>
    <p>Leeds. A for­mer evan­ge­list for pos­ses­sion foot­ball, his side scored five goals at the Eti­had and four at El­land Road with 28 and 32 per cent of the ball re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Le­ices­ter’s three no­table away wins have come with sim­i­lar blue­prints: keep­ing men be­hind the ball and then spring­ing quick breaks us­ing the pace of Jamie Vardy, a spe­cial­ist against the “Big Six”, with 43 goals against them. The only man to score two hat-tricks against Guardi­ola’s</p>
    <p>teams rev­els in the space be­hind am­bi­tious sides’ de­fences.</p>
    <p>Shorn of his two quick­est cen­tre-backs, in Gomez and van Dijk, Klopp could con­sider shift­ing his de­fen­sive line back to try and neu­tralise Vardy. As Le­ices­ter have eight penal­ties al­ready, he needs his makeshift rear­guard to be es­pe­cially care­ful in the box.</p>
    <p>At the other end, the ab­sence of Mo­hamed Salah, who has tested pos­i­tive for coron­avirus, may af­ford Le­ices­ter more of a chance,</p>
    <p>though it sug­gests Klopp will re­vert to 4-3-3 and that Diogo Jota will oc­cupy the Egyp­tian’s spot.</p>
    <p>It is a sign of Rodgers’ evo­lu­tion that Le­ices­ter have the joint-best de­fen­sive record, even though they have had a host of in­juries at the back. And yet, as he seeks to end Klopp’s 63-match un­beaten run at An­field, last sea­son’s meet­ings – a stop­page-time Liver­pool win­ner and a rout – may help ex­plain why Rodgers gets less credit on Mersey­side.</p>
