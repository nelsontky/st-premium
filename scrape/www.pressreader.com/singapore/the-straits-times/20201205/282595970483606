    <p>RACE 1 (,1800M)</p>
    <p>6 Dou­ble Take has proven to be a good gal­loper on the dirt, with a win four starts ago and a close sec­ond last start.</p>
    <p>7 Crown Av­enue is rac­ing well and has drawn favourably.</p>
    <p>9 Sweetly Baby won well first-up two starts ago on the dirt. He bears close watch­ing.</p>
    <p>3 Lon­don Luck­ys­tar is per­form­ing well. He should rel­ish the stepup to 1,800m.</p>
    <p>RACE 2 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>3 Viva Coun­cil could take plenty of catch­ing with ap­pren­tice Jerry Chau’s 7lb (3.18kg) claim.</p>
    <p>1 Re­gency Poet steps back to Class 5 which suits, as does Gate 3.</p>
    <p>2 Sky Trea­sure has scored on the dirt. Although he has drawn awk­wardly, he is a lead­ing player.</p>
    <p>8 Money­more switches to the dirt af­ter an im­pres­sive win on turf. But win­ning form is good form.</p>
    <p>RACE 3 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>4 Gold Comet is tal­ented. It will not take him long to break through for his first Hong Kong win.</p>
    <p>2 Golf­man Star put in a ca­reerbest fourth last time. The in­side gate and Al­fred Chan’s 7lb claim suit.</p>
    <p>7 Joy­ful Mo­ments is a vet­eran. The wide gate may just hin­der his chances a bit.</p>
    <p>9 War Lord has been in­con­sis­tent since his de­but win. Nev­er­the­less, he has drawn well and gets his chance un­der Joao Mor­eira.</p>
    <p>RACE 4 (1,650M)</p>
    <p>3 Dragon Com­man­der is win­less from 24 starts. But he has shown con­sid­er­able im­prove­ment this term. Mor­eira will be aboard.</p>
    <p>1 Bulb Elite has tri­alled well on the dirt. It would not shock to see him trans­late that form at the races.</p>
    <p>9 Sa­cred Tim­ing closed off nicely for a nar­row de­feat last time. He can make his pres­ence felt again.</p>
    <p>8 Ever Strong is next best.</p>
    <p>RACE 5 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>1 Soar­ing Tower won with au­thor­ity on de­but last time. The draw is slightly awk­ward but he re­mains in Class 4 which suits.</p>
    <p>9 Vec­tor has abil­ity. He de­serves for­give­ness for his first-up 10th. He can fin­ish strongly if rid­den qui­eter.</p>
    <p>2 Ex­cel­lent Char­iot clocked a slick 1min 8.67sec last time over the course and dis­tance. He can win his way to Class 3.</p>
    <p>10 Voy­age Star is best rid­den in front. He is a lead­ing player and should cling on to some prize money.</p>
    <p>RACE 6 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>4 Smooth­ies can prove hard to beat on his day. From the good gate with Chan’s claim, he could get his chance to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>1 E Star was a strong win­ner in this grade last start. A re­peat of that win would not sur­prise.</p>
    <p>7 Chicken Dance has re­turned in sound or­der from a lengthy break due to in­jury. Watch the bet­ting.</p>
    <p>9 Ig­nit­ing is open to im­prove­ment, fol­low­ing a tidy de­but third.</p>
    <p>RACE 7 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>1 My Sugar has shown im­ma­tu­rity at times. But he has tal­ent. The draw suits and it would not sur­prise to see him go one bet­ter.</p>
    <p>2 Cheer­ful Days is an­other with a stack of abil­ity. This could be his first win of a fruit­ful ca­reer.</p>
    <p>5 Di­a­mond Rhyme got off the mark last time. He can fig­ure again. 11 Sun Of Makfi has im­proved and can sur­prise from the good draw.</p>
    <p>RACE 8 (1,000M)</p>
    <p>3 Danc­ing Fighter won his re­cent bar­rier trial very im­pres­sively. The three-time win­ner rates strongly for the red-hot trainer Cas­par Fownes-Mor­eira com­bi­na­tion.</p>
    <p>12 Joy­ful For­tune’s last-start sec­ond holds him in good stead, es­pe­cially with Chau’s claim.</p>
    <p>5 Valiant Dream has been con­sis­tent without win­ning down the</p>
    <p>Sha Tin straight.</p>
    <p>1 Cruis­ing has to lug the big weight but was a win­ner two starts ago.</p>
    <p>RACE 9 (1,650M)</p>
    <p>14 Skyey Supreme can roll for­ward from Gate 2. He will take plenty of catch­ing with next to no weight on his back.</p>
    <p>9 Party Ev­ery­day will need a race run to suit, but he should be able to fin­ish strongly.</p>
    <p>1 Touch of Luck gets a wel­come relief in grade. He is back in Class 3. He also gets the ap­pren­tice’s claim and is a three-time win­ner on dirt. 2 Right Choice has abil­ity. It is just a mat­ter of us­ing it to score.</p>
    <p>RACE 10 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>3 Red Desert is a two-time win­ner over this course and dis­tance in this grade. He is fit­ter af­ter his first-up fourth.</p>
    <p>1 Will Power is shoot­ing for his third con­sec­u­tive win. The only con­cern is the top weight.</p>
    <p>12 Sunny Boy has drawn poorly but is a dirt spe­cial­ist. He can roll for­ward and make his own luck.</p>
    <p>4 En­core Boy is next best.</p>

One of his top chances is three-time win&#xAD;ner Danc&#xAD;ing Fighter in Race&#xD;&#xA;8.</p>
