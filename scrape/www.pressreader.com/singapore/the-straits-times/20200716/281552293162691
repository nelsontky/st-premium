    <p>Res­i­dents in China’s Wuhan city are now unit­ing to fight against flood­ing. The flood peak has now passed Wuhan, but the wa­ter level of the Yangtze River at the Wuhan sec­tion will re­main above the warn­ing level for about another 10 days. Con­cern is now shift­ing down­stream to Poyang Lake, which drains into the Yangtze in hard-hit Jiangxi prov­ince.</p>
    <p>WUHAN • Af­ter its ar­du­ous bat­tle against the coro­n­avirus out­break, Wuhan, the city hard­est hit by the epi­demic in China, is now unit­ing to fight against another en­emy – flood­ing.</p>
    <p>The Yangtze River, which runs through Wuhan in cen­tral China’s Hubei prov­ince, passed through the city at 11pm on Sun­day at a peak level of 28.8m. It was the river’s fourth-high­est recorded level in Wuhan.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the lo­cal gov­ern­ment and the city’s res­i­dents re­main on guard, as the sec­tion of the river in the city is likely to re­main above the warn­ing level for at least another 10 days.</p>
    <p>China’s na­tional ob­ser­va­tory re­newed a blue alert for rain­storms yes­ter­day, as in­ces­sant down­pours con­tin­ued to wreak havoc in vast stretches of the coun­try. China has a four-tier, colour-coded weather warn­ing sys­tem, with red rep­re­sent­ing the most se­vere, fol­lowed by or­ange, yel­low and blue.</p>
    <p>Heavy rain and thun­der­storms are ex­pected to­day i n parts of Sichuan, Chongqing, Shaanxi, He­nan, Hubei, An­hui, Jiangsu, Shang­hai and Zhe­jiang, said the Na­tional Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre ad­vised the lo­cal author­i­ties to re­main alert for pos­si­ble flood­ing, land­slides and mud­slides, and rec­om­mended stop­ping out­door op­er­a­tions in haz­ardous ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Wuhan res­i­dents, af­ter stay­ing at home to min­imise the spread of the coro­n­avirus ear­lier this year, have now come for­ward to pa­trol its flood em­bank­ments at all hours to pro­tect the city, which has a pop­u­la­tion of about 11 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The lo­cal author­i­ties said Wuhan now has about 30,000 peo­ple on pa­trol every day.</p>
    <p>Among them is Ms Wang Han, a Wuhan res­i­dent who was res­cued dur­ing the 1998 flood in the city. In 1998, Wuhan was hit hard by the flood­ing of the Yangtze – the third­longest river in the world – which killed more than 3,000 peo­ple and left 14 mil­lion peo­ple dis­placed along the Yangtze River basin.</p>
    <p>Ms Wang said she can still re­mem­ber clearly when Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army sol­diers res­cued her in an in­flat­able boat and took her home af­ter her pri­mary school was flooded. She was eight at the time.</p>
    <p>Now, the 30-year-old com­mu­nity worker has vol­un­teered to join the pa­trol of the city’s flood de­fences.</p>
    <p>“The Covid-19 out­break has made Wuhan peo­ple more united than ever, so we can quickly come to­gether to fight the flood,” said Ms Wang, who is from Xudong com­mu­nity in Wuchang dis­trict.</p>
    <p>She had helped el­derly peo­ple in her com­mu­nity get their gro­ceries dur­ing the out­break when the city was put un­der lock­down from Jan 23 to April 8.</p>
    <p>She started to pa­trol the 2.8km flood em­bank­ment near Xudong on July 8. Dur­ing her shift, from 6am to 2pm, she walked back and forth to check for any leaks in the em­bank­ment and to record the wa­ter level.</p>
    <p>“Last week, the wa­ter level was about 27m, and now it has sur­passed 28m. Flood con­trol shields were also put up along the em­bank­ment,” Ms Wang said.</p>
    <p>Like fight­ing the pan­demic, the bat­tle against the flood can be fa­tal.</p>
    <p>Early on Mon­day, Mr Shu Mingzhi, di­rec­tor of the wa­ter af­fairs ser­vice cen­tre of Xin­chong sub­dis­trict, fell ill when he was patch­ing up the em­bank­ment at a lake in Wuhan. The 59-year-old later died of a brain haem­or­rhage in hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Mr Shu had been work­ing for more than 30 days with­out a break to fight the floods since the city en­tered the rainy sea­son, ac­cord­ing to the Wuhan gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Al­though the flood peak has now passed Wuhan, Mr Chen Guiya, deputy chief engi­neer of the Changjiang Wa­ter Re­sources Com­mis­sion, said on Tues­day that the wa­ter level of the Yangtze River at the Wuhan sec­tion will re­main above the warn­ing level for about</p>
    <p>UNITED IN AD­VER­SITY</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 out­break has made Wuhan peo­ple more united than ever, so we can quickly come to­gether to ’’ fight the flood.</p>
    <p>MS WANG HAN, a Wuhan res­i­dent who has vol­un­teered to help pa­trol the city’s flood de­fences.</p>
    <p>another 10 days.</p>
    <p>Since the crest passed Wuhan, con­cern has shifted down­stream to Poyang Lake, which drains into the Yangtze in hard-hit Jiangxi prov­ince.</p>
    <p>Sum­mer rains and sea­sonal glacial melt in the Yangtze’s Ti­betan plateau head­wa­ters cause rou­tine an­nual flood­ing.</p>
    <p>But en­vi­ron­men­tal­ists say the threat has wors­ened over t he decades, due in part to ram­pant con­struc­tion of dams and lev­ees that have cut con­nec­tions be­tween the river and ad­ja­cent lakes and flood­plains that for cen­turies had helped ab­sorb the sum­mer surge.</p>
