    <p>• Of­fi­cials at the US State Depart­ment have drawn up a pro­posal to des­ig­nate Cuba as a state spon­sor of ter­ror­ism, a fi­nal-hour for­eign pol­icy move that would com­pli­cate plans by the i ncom­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion to re­lax increased Amer­i­can pressure on Ha­vana.</p>
    <p>With three weeks left un­til In­au­gu­ra­tion Day, Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo must de­cide whether to sign off on the plan, ac­cord­ing to two US of­fi­cials. The move would also serve as a “thank you” to Cuban Amer­i­cans and other anti-com­mu­nist Lati­nos in Florida who strongly sup­ported Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and his fel­low Repub­li­cans in the elec­tion last month.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear whether Mr Pom­peo has de­cided to move ahead with the des­ig­na­tion.</p>
    <p>But Democrats and for­eign pol­icy ex­perts be­lieve that Mr Trump and his se­nior of­fi­cials are ea­ger to find ways of con­strain­ing Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s ini­tial months in of­fice and to make it more dif­fi­cult for Mr Bi­den to re­verse Trump-era poli­cies abroad.</p>
    <p>In re­cent weeks, Trump of­fi­cials have also sought to in­crease Amer­i­can pressure and sanc­tions on China and Iran.</p>
    <p>A find­ing that a coun­try has “re­peat­edly pro­vided sup­port for acts of in­ter­na­tional ter­ror­ism” – i n the State Depart­ment’s of­fi­cial de­scrip­tion of a state spon­sor of ter­ror­ism – au­to­mat­i­cally trig­gers US sanc­tions against its govern­ment.</p>
    <p>If added to the list, Cuba would join just three other na­tions: Iran, North Korea and Syria.</p>
    <p>The Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion could move quickly to take Cuba back off the list. But do­ing so would re­quire more than the stroke of a pres­i­den­tial pen. The State Depart­ment would have to con­duct a for­mal re­view, a process that might take sev­eral months.</p>
    <p>Democrats on Tues­day as­sailed the Cuba pro­posal, crit­i­cis­ing what they called an eleventh-hour for­eign pol­icy change that un­fairly lim­its the in­com­ing Bi­den team.</p>
    <p>“It’s an­other stunt by this pres­i­dent with less than 23 days to go,” said Demo­cratic Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Gre­gory W. Meeks of New York, who is the new chair­man of the House For­eign Af­fairs Com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>The State Depart­ment re­moved Cuba from its list of ter­ror­ism spon­sors in 2015, after Pres­i­dent Barack Obama announced the nor­mal­i­sa­tion of re­la­tions be­tween Wash­ing­ton and Ha­vana for the first time since the coun­try’s 1959 com­mu­nist revo­lu­tion, which he called a relic of the Cold War.</p>
