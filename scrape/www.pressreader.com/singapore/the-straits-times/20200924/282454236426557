    <p>So it turns out that Sher­lock Holmes has a lit­tle sis­ter – and that she is ca­pa­ble of out-sleuthing the fa­mous de­tec­tive him­self.</p>
    <p>That is the premise of Enola Holmes, a new Net­flix movie adapted from the young-adult book se­ries of the same name writ­ten by Nancy Springer.</p>
    <p>Set in 1880s Eng­land, it stars Mil­lie Bobby Brown as Enola, a smart and spir­ited teenager who has been raised to be fiercely ca­pa­ble, in­de­pen­dent and a bit of a whiz at solv­ing puz­zles.</p>
    <p>When her mother Eu­do­ria (He­lena Bon­ham Carter from 2010’s The King’s Speech) mys­te­ri­ously van­ishes, Enola runs away to try and track her down, leav­ing older brother Sher­lock (Henry Cav­ill from 2013’s Man Of Steel) in pur­suit of them both.</p>
    <p>At 16, Brown – the English star of the hit sci­ence-fic­tion hor­ror se­ries Stranger Things (2016 to present) – is the same age as the char­ac­ter, whose un­con­ven­tional mother has raised her to be some­thing of a fem­i­nist.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the me­dia on a re­cent video call from the East Coast of the United States, she says she her­self had a fem­i­nist awak­en­ing when she first en­coun­tered sex­ism in Hol­ly­wood.</p>
    <p>Brown, who be­gins the in­ter­view by en­thus­ing about the num­ber of fe­male re­porters on the call – “I love that you’re all women jour­nal­ists, that makes me so happy” – ad­mits she had never re­ally thought about gen­der equal­ity prior to that.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore get­ting into act­ing, I was never ed­u­cated enough to know much about women’s rights.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause you don’t re­ally get taught that in school, which is kind of crazy,” says the star, who had small parts in the tele­vi­sion se­ries Grey’s Anatomy (2005 to present) and Mod­ern Fam­ily (2009 to this year) in 2015 be­fore land­ing her break­out role on Stranger Things, where she plays a girl with psy­choki­netic pow­ers.</p>
    <p>“But when I got into the in­dus­try and was work­ing on Stranger Things, I started go­ing on more sets and meet­ing new peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“And I found my­self in sit­u­a­tions where I felt I wasn’t get­ting equal op­por­tu­nity as other peo­ple,” re­calls the ac­tress, who has been nom­i­nated for an Emmy twice for Stranger Things.</p>
    <p>It slowly dawned on her that this of­ten had some­thing to do with her gen­der, age and ex­pe­ri­ence, “and I hated that that was what was hold­ing me back”.</p>
    <p>Work­ing on the Enola Holmes movie, how­ever, has helped her be­come more em­pow­ered, says the ac­tress, who iden­ti­fied with the char­ac­ter and her search for pur­pose in life.</p>
    <p>“Enola is very hon­est, her sense of hu­mour is ex­actly the same as mine, we both care a lot and she val­ues her fam­ily like I do. So we have many sim­i­lar­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“And this is a com­ing-of-age story about a young girl find­ing her pur­pose in life. As you know, to be a young girl in any in­dus­try, it can be dif­fi­cult to find your place.”</p>
    <p>But Brown has fi­nally learnt to strike a bal­ance be­tween work and find­ing time for her­self, she says.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause I’m 16 and I’m also very busy, it’s hard to take the time to show my­self self-love and self-care.</p>
    <p>“And when film­ing this, I learnt that it’s okay to do that and find your pur­pose – so it’s ac­tu­ally my com­ing-of-age story as well as Enola’s. We were both re­ally go­ing on a jour­ney to­gether,” she adds.</p>
    <p>The fem­i­nist themes in the movie have also given Brown li­cence to pub­licly ad­dress such is­sues more of­ten.</p>
    <p>“Mak­ing this film gave me the em­pow­er­ment to talk about sex­ism, es­pe­cially in this in­dus­try.”</p>
    <p>And her in­ten­tion is to “in­flu­ence ed­u­ca­tion so that young girls can be ed­u­cated on their rights”, says the star, who in 2018 be­came the youngest per­son to land on Time mag­a­zine’s list of the world’s 100 most in­flu­en­tial peo­ple, and the youngest United Na­tions Chil­dren’s Fund Good­will Am­bas­sador.</p>
    <p>Enola Holmes is also the first pro­ject to earn the ac­tress a pro­ducer credit – some­thing she is clearly proud of.</p>
    <p>“It was in­cred­i­bly re­ward­ing to star in this film and also be part of the pro­duc­tion. I be­lieve that we should have more young fe­male film-mak­ers out there and I also love the pro­duc­tion side of film­ing.</p>
    <p>“It was a new learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ence and I had so much fun.”</p>
