    <p>The third and fi­nal man linked to the rob­bery of an Ang Mo Kio jew­ellery store last year was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to 27 months’ jail and a fine of $20,000.</p>
    <p>Shar­avin­dran Sup­piah, 32, had ear­lier pleaded guilty to four counts of dis­hon­estly re­ceiv­ing stolen prop­erty, which also in­volved items taken in the rob­bery.</p>
    <p>He also ad­mit­ted to seven other un­re­lated of­fences, in­clud­ing as­sault and driv­ing a car on Aug 13 last year, even though he did not have a li­cence to do so.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, he was dis­qual­i­fied from driv­ing all classes of ve­hi­cles for six months over the traf­fic of­fence.</p>
    <p>The mas­ter­mind of the rob­bery, M. Je­gath­eesh, 28, was sen­tenced on Thurs­day to three years and three months’ jail, and six strokes of the cane.</p>
    <p>Veera­mani Subran Das, 37, who drove the get­away car, was sen­tenced to three years’ jail and six strokes of the cane on Nov 2.</p>
    <p>All three men are Sin­ga­pore­ans. Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tors Thi­agesh Suku­maran and Jeremy Bin told the court Je­gath­eesh met the two oth­ers in Gey­lang at about 9pm on Aug 13 last year to plan the heist.</p>
    <p>The next day, Veera­mani met Je­gath­eesh in a car at a carpark near Block 521 Ang Mo Kio Av­enue 5 at around 2.40pm.</p>
    <p>Je­gath­eesh went alone to Hock Cheong Jade and Jew­ellery shop, lo­cated at Block 574, Ang Mo Kio Av­enue 10, and com­mit­ted the rob­bery. He filled a duf­fle bag with valu­ables worth nearly $120,000 in to­tal and ran into a car driven by Veera­mani. The two men then left the scene.</p>
    <p>When they got to the same carpark in Ang Mo Kio, Veera­mani took the duf­fle bag and they parted ways. Later that day, Veera­mani met Shar­avin­dran, who in­spected the con­tents of the bag.</p>
    <p>The DPPs said: “Shar­avin­dran was in­structed by Je­gath­eesh to safe­keep the jew­ellery in a place known by Je­gath­eesh while they fig­ured out how to off­load it.</p>
    <p>“He directed Veera­mani to drive to Dakota Cres­cent, where he knew there were aban­doned blocks of Hous­ing Board flats.”</p>
    <p>While Veera­mani waited, Shar­avin­dran car­ried a bag con­tain­ing the valu­ables to the sixth storey of a block. He placed the bag into the cis­tern of a toi­let bowl and the two men left the scene.</p>
    <p>In an un­re­lated case, the court heard that Shar­avin­dran worked with three other men and a woman to re­ceive stolen cheques in 2017. He also as­saulted a 47-year-old man in Gey­lang in July 2017 fol­low­ing a dis­pute.</p>
