    <p>At a re­cent din­ner with friends, two views pre­vailed on the case of a do­mes­tic helper of a pow­er­ful business leader in Sin­ga­pore, who was ac­quit­ted of the theft of $34,000 worth of items on ap­peal.</p>
    <p>One friend grum­bled at why the me­dia was still fix­ated on the case when the ap­peal was over and she had been ac­quit­ted. Was this a case of chao leng fan, or fry­ing cold rice, she asked.</p>
    <p>I ven­tured the view that there were pub­lic in­ter­est is­sues in­volved, and that gov­ern­ment agen­cies were re­view­ing the han­dling of the case.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian do­mes­tic worker</p>
    <p>Parti Liyani, 46, worked for Mr Liew Mun Leong and his fam­ily from 2007 to 2016. Mr Liew, 74, is best known as for­mer CEO of prop­erty group Cap­i­taLand. He re­signed last Thurs­day as chair­man of the Changi Air­port Group and other cor­po­rate po­si­tions, fol­low­ing pub­lic out­cry over the court case.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to her em­ployer’s home, Ms Parti had been asked to clean the of­fice and then the house of Mr Liew’s son Karl, which is against Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) reg­u­la­tions on de­ploy­ment of for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers. She made known her un­hap­pi­ness over the ar­range­ment. Re­la­tions be­tween her and the younger Mr Liew ap­peared to sour. He ter­mi­nated her em­ploy­ment, while the el­der Mr Liew was over­seas, giv­ing her two hours to pack the same day. When dis­missed, she threat­ened to re­port the fam­ily to MOM for il­le­gal de­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>The Liew fam­ily’s ver­sion is that they had been sus­pect­ing her of steal­ing from them and ar­ranged to have her sent back on Oct 28, 2016. Af­ter she had left with her travel lug­gage that day, leav­ing three boxes of be­long­ings, the fam­ily checked the maid’s boxes, and found items that they al­leged were stolen. On Oct 30, Mr Liew, who had re­turned from his trip, and his son Karl filed a po­lice re­port ac­cus­ing Ms Parti of theft.</p>
    <p>The case has riv­eted Sin­ga­pore­ans, as de­tails emerged from the ap­peal judg­ment. Like many Sin­ga­pore­ans, an­other friend at the din­ner had clearly been fol­low­ing it closely. She could re­count in­stances of in­con­sis­ten­cies in the ev­i­dence of the Liew fam­ily over the al­legedly stolen items.</p>
    <p>One ex­am­ple: a used bed­sheet Mr Karl Liew claimed he had bought from Habi­tat in Bri­tain and val­ued at $100, had the same pat­tern as a quilt cover with an Ikea la­bel that had been found in Ms Parti’s boxes. Mr Karl Liew’s wife Heather Lim tes­ti­fied that she had never seen the bed­sheet in Ms Parti’s room or on her bed.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, Ms Parti recog­nised the item and said she had bought the bed­sheet and quilt cover bed set at Ikea, Alexan­dra, for $49.</p>
    <p>The High Court judge hear­ing the ap­peal, Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn, con­cluded: “On a to­tal­ity of the ev­i­dence, and in par­tic­u­lar, the ob­jec­tive ev­i­dence which strongly sug­gests that the bed­sheet was from Ikea, I find that Karl fab­ri­cated his tes­ti­mony about hav­ing pur­chased the bed­sheet from Habi­tat in the UK. In­stead, I be­lieve Parti’s ev­i­dence that she pur­chased the bed­sheet to­gether with the quilt cover as a set from Ikea. Clearly, the con­vic­tion for theft of the bed­sheet is against the weight of the ev­i­dence and is not sus­tain­able.”</p>
    <p>This short quote, on one sin­gle item among the list of about 144 items Ms Parti is ac­cused of steal­ing, gives a flavour of the level of de­tail and close rea­son­ing of Jus­tice Chan’s judg­ment, which is avail­able on­line.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan had also pointed to a com­mon­sen­si­cal point: that it was “rather un­usual” that the al­leged stolen items ap­pear to be spoilt, bro­ken or of no value to the al­leged own­ers. Ms Parti’s de­fence was that the items were dis­carded and found by her, given to her or pur­chased by her. Some were also not packed by her, she had claimed. Jus­tice Chan found that the pros­e­cu­tion had not proven their case be­yond rea­son­able doubt, and ac­quit­ted her.</p>
    <p>The ac­quit­tal has spawned many re­ports on main­stream and social me­dia, with Sin­ga­pore­ans fol­low­ing the de­tails, and not shy to make their views known on­line.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties too are tak­ing note. The At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) said Jus­tice Chan’s “findings do raise ques­tions which war­rant fur­ther in­ves­ti­ga­tions” and it will study the judg­ment to as­sess what fur­ther ac­tion, if any, ought to be taken in this case.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power said it is in con­sul­ta­tion with the AGC as to whether fur­ther ac­tion ought to be taken in this case.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said that they would be look­ing into sev­eral ob­ser­va­tions on po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions made by Jus­tice Chan.</p>
    <p>Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam said the agen­cies look­ing into the High Court’s judg­ment take the judge’s com­ments “very se­ri­ously”.</p>
    <p>“Some­thing has gone wrong in the chain of events. We have to look at that, and deal with what went wrong,” said the min­is­ter. How­ever, he also added that peo­ple should not “pre­judge which part of the process went wrong” while re­views are be­ing con­ducted.</p>
    <p>“In the process, we should not be de­fen­sive. It should not be a witch hunt. We have to find out what hap­pened, why it hap­pened and then deal with it,” he added.</p>
    <p>DE­LIV­ER­ING BLIND JUS­TICE</p>
    <p>What is one to make of this case?</p>
    <p>At one level, it is a story of how per­sis­tence and be­lief in one­self can pre­vail against in­sur­mount­able odds. Ms Parti said she never be­lieved her­self guilty.</p>
    <p>At an­other level, this is a story of how a group of ded­i­cated social ac­tivists helped a do­mes­tic maid take on the sys­tem – and won, within the sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti was aided by a bevy of mi­grant worker ac­tivists and rights groups, who found a stout cham­pion for her in de­fence lawyer Anil Balchan­dani, who acted pro bono in the case and ap­peal that stretched four years. He earned warm praise from Jus­tice Chan for his de­tailed and per­sua­sive sub­mis­sions, and his ded­i­ca­tion to his pro bono work.</p>
    <p>As Jus­tice Chan’s judg­ment made clear, there were flaws in the jus­tice sys­tem be­gin­ning with the po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tion to the trial it­self that had led to her ear­lier con­vic­tion.</p>
    <p>In over­turn­ing the con­vic­tion on ap­peal, Jus­tice Chan both ex­posed a po­ten­tial flaw in the court sys­tem and righted it, within the court sys­tem it­self.</p>
    <p>This last point bears re­peat­ing.</p>
    <p>This is a case, as Mr Shan­mugam noted, of how jus­tice is both blind and jus­tice has been de­liv­ered. He made this state­ment while say­ing that the jus­tice sys­tem is im­par­tial to all and fair, and the sta­tus and po­si­tion of the par­ties in­volved does not mat­ter.</p>
    <p>In­deed, if er­rors were made, they should be pointed out in the re­view and re­me­dial steps taken to cor­rect and pre­vent them. But the in­di­vid­ual flaws should not be nec­es­sar­ily taken as signs that the ed­i­fice is crum­bling.</p>
    <p>THE­O­RIES MUST FIT THE FACTS</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, the emo­tive fac­tors of this case are so strong that many Sin­ga­pore­ans are li­able to project into this case their own feel­ings about the ills of Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ety, re­gard­less of how well the facts fit the the­o­ries.</p>
    <p>So those who be­lieve that Sin­ga­pore’s sys­tem is in­her­ently elit­ist, with the elite hav­ing their own set of rules, will see ev­i­dence of bias by law en­force­ment of­fi­cers in the face of a priv­i­leged and pow­er­ful com­plainant.</p>
    <p>They may also point to as­pects of the Liew fam­ily’s be­hav­iour as ev­i­dence of moral de­cay among the priv­i­leged. Al­ready, in­ter­est­ing ar­ti­cles about how the rich are men­tally geared to be­have in a self-seek­ing be­hav­iour are cir­cu­lat­ing on­line.</p>
    <p>Some may see in this case ev­i­dence of their be­lief that the Sin­ga­pore sys­tem is stacked in favour of the rich and well-ed­u­cated, against the man in the street and the or­di­nary worker. But this view ig­nores the truth of what hap­pened – which is that a poor worker won a court case against a rich, pow­er­ful fam­ily.</p>
    <p>While many crit­ics will be tempted to drape their pet the­o­ries of Sin­ga­pore’s so­ci­etal de­cline onto this con­ve­nient frame, I hope that most Sin­ga­pore­ans will be fair-minded and bal­anced in as­sess­ing the case, es­pe­cially as the au­thor­i­ties start to fig­ure out what went wrong to result in the ear­lier con­vic­tion.</p>
    <p>At the same time, how­ever, Sin­ga­pore­ans have ev­ery rea­son to ex­pect that the re­views must dig deep into the facts of the case, and probe the mo­ti­va­tions that drive be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>PROB­ING DEEP</p>
    <p>The key as­pect of this case that de­serves se­ri­ous study in any re­view is this: how the jus­tice sys­tem worked to de­liver a guilty ver­dict against Ms Parti in the first trial.</p>
    <p>Some salient facts made ev­i­dent from the judg­ment: The po­lice in­ves­ti­gat­ing of­fi­cer had put out a war­rant of ar­rest on Oct 30, 2016, the same day Mr Liew made a po­lice re­port against Ms Parti for theft.</p>
    <p>But the of­fi­cer vis­ited the Liew res­i­dence only five weeks later, on Dec 3, to doc­u­ment the al­legedly stolen items. This was a day af­ter Ms Parti, un­aware of the theft charges, flew back to Sin­ga­pore from In­done­sia to try to find an­other job. She was ar­rested at the air­port on ar­rival.</p>
    <p>The al­leged stolen items from the three boxes were left in the home for the fam­ily to use mean­while, even af­ter they were doc­u­mented. They were re­ceived into po­lice cus­tody much later – on April 18, 2018.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan pointed out that there was a break in the chain of cus­tody of ev­i­dence, leav­ing open the ques­tion of whether the al­legedly stolen items were ac­cu­rately doc­u­mented. They could also have been mixed up with other items or oth­er­wise con­tam­i­nated. He also found that state­ments had been taken from Ms Parti with­out an in­ter­preter in her na­tive Ba­hasa In­done­sia present.</p>
    <p>The se­quence of events raises ques­tions over po­lice process.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan also took is­sue with the judg­ment of the trial judge, go­ing over her de­ci­sion on each charge. The most damn­ing as­pect of his care­ful anal­y­sis of the trial judge’s de­ci­sion-mak­ing process is his state­ment that the trial judge had “mis­ap­plied the le­gal and ev­i­den­tial bur­dens of proof”.</p>
    <p>One ex­am­ple: Ms Parti was ac­cused of steal­ing some kitchen­ware items found in her boxes to be shipped back to In­done­sia. She said they were her items bought from a thrift shop, Hock Siong. The trial judge had noted that no wit­ness from Hock Siong was called to cor­rob­o­rate Ms Parti’s story.</p>
    <p>Noted Jus­tice Chan: “The judge es­sen­tially drew an ad­verse in­fer­ence (though not ex­plic­itly stated as such) against the de­fence for its fail­ure to call a wit­ness from Hock Siong to the stand to ver­ify the ve­rac­ity of Parti’s al­leged pa­tron­age of Hock Siong.</p>
    <p>“In my judg­ment, this con­sti­tutes an im­per­mis­si­ble re­ver­sal of the bur­den of proof on the ac­cused. It ap­pears that the same stan­dard of proof was not de­manded or re­quired of the pros­e­cu­tion.”</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to an­other item, a pink knife, in the charge, Jus­tice Chan noted: “No ad­verse in­fer­ences were drawn against the pros­e­cu­tion from fail­ing to call wit­nesses who could cor­rob­o­rate or sup­port Karl’s in­ter­nally con­tra­dic­tory tes­ti­mony re­gard­ing his al­leged own­er­ship of the pink knife, when there was no in­ves­ti­ga­tion.”</p>
    <p>The pink knife in ques­tion was an item Mr Karl Liew said that was bought when he was a stu­dent in Bri­tain, which he had brought back to Sin­ga­pore in 2002. But on ques­tion­ing, he ad­mit­ted that the knife was of a mod­ern de­sign that could not have been in pro­duc­tion in Bri­tain be­fore 2002.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing this as “an­other ex­am­ple of Karl’s in­ter­nally in­con­sis­tent ev­i­dence that went against both his claim of own­er­ship of the pink knife and his cred­i­bil­ity”, Jus­tice Chan noted that the trial judge had failed to ad­dress this.</p>
    <p>He added: “I em­pha­sise that an ac­cused per­son is pre­sumed in­no­cent and this pre­sump­tion is not dis­placed un­til the pros­e­cu­tion has dis­charged its bur­den of proof... Sim­ply put, it is not the re­spon­si­bil­ity of the de­fence to dis­prove the pros­e­cu­tion’s case.”</p>
    <p>It is strik­ing that an ap­peal judge sees fit to re­mind a lower court judge of such a ba­sic pil­lar of the law – in­no­cent un­til proven guilty.</p>
    <p>From in­ves­ti­ga­tion stage to trial, it would ap­pear that some ques­tion­able de­ci­sions were made.</p>
    <p>The Law Min­istry and its re­lated agen­cies will, I hope, sieve through the ev­i­dence to come to a con­clu­sion on the par­tic­u­lar mer­its of this case, in an­swer­ing how the first trial de­liv­ered a judg­ment found to be so faulty, and take re­me­dial ac­tions.</p>
    <p>What­ever the findings, I hope the re­view process goes fur­ther, and that it does not shirk from the tougher, un­der­ly­ing ques­tions around bias and priv­i­lege.</p>
    <p>To what ex­tent were law en­force­ment in­di­vid­u­als and the ju­di­ciary of­fi­cers act­ing out of im­plicit or ex­plicit bias that ac­corded the Liew fam­ily more respect and at­ten­tion than was given to the ac­cused, a for­eign do­mes­tic worker?</p>
    <p>It is well known in law en­force­ment world­wide that of­fi­cers dis­crim­i­nate on the ba­sis of race, so­cioe­co­nomic class and im­mi­gra­tion sta­tus. Was this a fac­tor in the way the in­ves­ti­ga­tion was han­dled?</p>
    <p>Even more im­por­tant is to con­sider what as­pects of our jus­tice sys­tem cre­ates ob­sta­cles for the poor and less-re­sourced. What can we do to tilt the scales of jus­tice to a more bal­anced dis­tri­bu­tion?</p>
    <p>The un­der­ly­ing ques­tion to con­sider is whether our jus­tice sys­tem is or­gan­ised in such a way that poor and un­e­d­u­cated for­eign work­ers are given short shrift in their search for jus­tice. If so, can we re­view what the bar­ri­ers are and iden­tify the nec­es­sary steps we must take to en­sure jus­tice is blind to social sta­tus, wealth and na­tion­al­ity?</p>
    <p>What­ever the re­sults of the re­view process, how­ever, Sin­ga­pore­ans should also bear in mind that no sys­tem, how­ever well de­signed, is per­fect. Even as gaps are iden­ti­fied and fixed, we should also be re­al­is­tic and ac­cept that lapses in process and judg­ments will al­ways oc­cur in a hu­man­designed and hu­man-run sys­tem.</p>
    <p>This is pre­cisely why most court cases are open to the pub­lic and the me­dia, and why there is a process of ju­di­cial ap­peal. That worked in this case, and rightly so. Keep­ing the court process open, sub­ject to scru­tiny and checks and bal­ances, is a key plank in build­ing cred­i­bil­ity and es­tab­lish­ing trust in the ju­di­cial process.</p>
    <p>The case of Ms Parti Liyani, ap­pel­lant against pub­lic pros­e­cu­tor, re­spon­dent num­bered SGHC 187, is an op­por­tu­nity for Sin­ga­pore to take a good hard look at how our jus­tice sys­tem fares when it comes to de­fend­ing the vul­ner­a­ble for­eign work­ers in our midst.</p>
    <p>I hope that, just as we want Sin­ga­pore­ans to be fair-minded in as­sess­ing this case, and test their the­o­ries against the facts, the au­thor­i­ties re­view­ing the case will be sim­i­larly fair-minded and probe for un­der­ly­ing bi­ases and sys­temic flaws be­neath the par­tic­u­lar facts of this case.</p>
