    <p>A Man­darin-speak­ing AI as­sis­tant for the el­derly and an in­ter­ac­tive plat­form tout­ing Sin­ga­pore’s at­trac­tions to Chi­nese vis­i­tors on WeChat are among tech­nol­ogy prod­ucts that could be launched as a result of tieups inked be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Chongqing com­pa­nies yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 17 mem­o­ran­dums of un­der­stand­ing (MOUs) were signed as part of the third an­nual Smart</p>
    <p>China Expo, which was held in a vir­tual for­mat for the first time.</p>
    <p>The con­fer­ence and ex­hi­bi­tion, which saw the par­tic­i­pa­tion of 32 Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies and or­gan­i­sa­tions, were streamed live yes­ter­day us­ing a ded­i­cated data link be­tween the south-western Chi­nese city Chongqing and Sin­ga­pore that was launched last year.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has made ‘go­ing dig­i­tal’ cen­tral to ev­ery­day in­ter­ac­tion. Like China and other economies, Sin­ga­pore is keen to turn ad­ver­sity into op­por­tu­nity,” said Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo yes­ter­day dur­ing the open­ing cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>“This is even as we ex­plore the use of dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies to un­lock new value and busi­ness mod­els in ev­ery sec­tor of our econ­omy.”</p>
    <p>Among the MOUs signed yes­ter­day was one be­tween lo­cal tech­nol­ogy com­pany AFPI and Chongqing tech firm Lis­ten Data Tech­nol­ogy to build a smart el­der home-care sys­tem pow­ered by AI.</p>
    <p>AFPI is build­ing the as-yet un­named de­vice which will be able to un­der­stand voice com­mands in Man­darin such as “I need help”, while its Chongqing part­ner will gather the large amounts of data, such as voice sam­ples, that the de­vice needs to do its work. The de­vice must be able to recog­nise dif­fer­ent kinds of voices and in­to­na­tion, for ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>“Our part­ner has all the con­tact points so that makes (col­lect­ing data) much eas­ier than if we had to do it our­selves,” said AFPI se­nior vice-pres­i­dent for busi­ness de­vel­op­ment John Tan.</p>
    <p>He added that AFPI wants to roll out its first de­vices within a year.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Sin­ga­pore-based tech­nol­ogy start-up Fooyo is de­vel­op­ing an in­ter­ac­tive plat­form that will pro­mote Sin­ga­pore’s tourist at­trac­tions to vis­i­tors from China.</p>
    <p>Fooyo, which also has of­fices in Chongqing, is work­ing with tourism com­pa­nies TTG Asia Me­dia and TriStar In­ter­na­tional Event Man­age­ment. The plat­form will sit on China’s most pop­u­lar mes­sag­ing app WeChat, which has more than one bil­lion ac­tive users.</p>
    <p>Users can in­put their bud­get and in­tended length of stay into the plat­form, which will then gen­er­ate a cus­tomised itin­er­ary.</p>
    <p>Fooyo co-founder Liu Yang­fan said it is bet­ting on China be­ing one of the first coun­tries to open cross­bor­der travel with Sin­ga­pore when the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion al­lows.</p>
    <p>“With our plat­form, we’re look­ing at and pre­par­ing for the po­ten­tial re­sump­tion of travel after Covid-19.”</p>
