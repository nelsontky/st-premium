    <p>Chelsea man­ager Frank Lam­pard said he ex­pects Hakim Ziyech to prove his value af­ter the Moroc­can star scored his first goal for the club in Wed­nes­day’s 4-0 win at Krasnodar in the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>Jorginho missed a penalty for Chelsea but Cal­lum Hud­son-Odoi put the Blues in front be­fore half­time af­ter a mis­take by Krasnodar goal­keeper Matvei Sa­fonov.</p>
    <p>Timo Werner smashed in a spot kick on 76 min­utes to dou­ble Chelsea’s lead, with Ziyech and Chris­tian Pulisic adding late goals.</p>
    <p>“Hakim Ziyech has worked re­ally hard to be fit, and I was very ex­cited to get his qual­ity in the team,” said Lam­pard.</p>
    <p>“I thought his per­for­mance was very, very good when you con­sider he hasn’t started a match since March, when the Dutch league fin­ished.”</p>
    <p>Ziyech joined from Ajax for a re­ported £37 mil­lion (S$65.6 mil­lion) in the sum­mer but missed the be­gin­ning of the sea­son with a knee prob­lem.</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old had made three cameos as a substitute be­fore earn­ing his first start in Krasnodar, Rus­sia, some 3,500km from Lon­don.</p>
    <p>“It’s been frus­trat­ing for him and for us. His in­jury has meant he hasn’t been able to start, but what I’ve seen in train­ing and what I knew we were sign­ing is a player of im­mense qual­ity with per­son­al­ity to re­ceive the ball and find as­sists and goals,” added Lam­pard.</p>
    <p>“We saw a lot of glimpses of that to­day, and he will get bet­ter.</p>
    <p>“We brought him in to do a job, maybe peo­ple have forgotten a bit be­cause we signed him in Jan­uary and he missed the start of the sea­son, but tonight he showed he is here.”</p>
    <p>Chelsea moved up to four points at the top of Group E af­ter two matches, level with Sevilla, who beat Rennes 1-0 in Spain.</p>
    <p>Lam­pard will also speak with his play­ers be­fore de­cid­ing whether Jorginho re­mains the club’s penalty taker af­ter the Ital­ian missed his se­cond spot kick of the sea­son. He also failed to score against Liver­pool in the Pre­mier League last month.</p>
    <p>“Jorginho has had an in­cred­i­bly suc­cess­ful rate of scor­ing penal­ties in his ca­reer, par­tic­u­larly at Chelsea,” the Chelsea boss said.</p>
    <p>“My feel­ing is when you take as many penal­ties as he does, there can be pe­ri­ods when you miss one, and some­times there can be pe­ri­ods where you miss one or two.”</p>
