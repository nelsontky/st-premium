    <p>1 Fires turn sky or­ange</p>
    <p>The sky in San Francisco’s Bay Area turned a deep or­ange on Wed­nes­day from wild­fire smoke that at times blocked out sun­light en­tirely. En­tire com­mu­ni­ties have been razed by wild­fires rag­ing in the west­ern United States, with of­fi­cials warn­ing of po­ten­tial mass deaths.</p>
    <p>CLO­VIS (United States) • En­tire com­mu­ni­ties have been razed by wild­fires rag­ing in the west­ern United States, with of­fi­cials warn­ing of po­ten­tial mass deaths un­der apoc­a­lyp­tic or­ange skies.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple in the San Francisco Bay Area awoke on Wed­nes­day to a deep or­ange sky caused by wild­fire smoke that at times blocked out sun­light en­tirely.</p>
    <p>The dark skies were ac­com­pa­nied in some places with ash fall­ing like snow.</p>
    <p>“The or­ange skies this morn­ing are a re­sult of wild­fire smoke in the air,” San Francisco Bay air qual­ity of­fi­cials said in a tweet.</p>
    <p>“These smoke par­ti­cles scat­ter blue light and only al­low yel­low-or­ange-red light to reach the sur­face, caus­ing skies to look or­ange.”</p>
    <p>As smoke gets thick in some ar­eas, it blocks sun­light, caus­ing dark skies, the of­fi­cials ex­plained.</p>
    <p>Pho­tos of the eerie scene, par­tic­u­larly of a San Francisco sky­line fit for a dystopian sci­ence fic­tion film, spread quickly on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>“Is there a word for ‘the apoc­a­lypse is upon us burnt si­enna?’” read one tweet fired off by some­one who felt us­ing the word “or­ange” to de­scribe the sky was be­ing too kind.</p>
    <p>Much of the smoke blew down from the north, where the Bear Fire ex­ploded at an un­prece­dented speed overnight, com­bin­ing with older blazes to scorch over 101,000ha and threaten the town of Oroville.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia and Wash­ing­ton states have been scram­bling to con­tain the rapidly spread­ing wild­fires since the week­end due to un­prece­dented heat­waves fol­lowed by in­tense, dry winds.</p>
    <p>At least six peo­ple in the US were con­firmed dead by late Wed­nes­day, with of­fi­cials warn­ing that more deaths would likely be re­ported in the com­ing days as many ar­eas were still im­pos­si­ble to reach.</p>
    <p>Wed­nes­day’s fa­tal­i­ties in­cluded a one-year-old boy who died while his par­ents suf­fered se­vere burns as they at­tempted to flee an in­ferno 200km east of Seat­tle, in Wash­ing­ton state.</p>
    <p>Five towns were “sub­stan­tially de­stroyed” as wide­spread evac­u­a­tions took place across the north­west­ern state of Ore­gon, Gov­er­nor Kate Brown said.</p>
    <p>“This could be the great­est loss of hu­man lives and prop­erty due to wild­fire in our state’s his­tory,” she told a press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Tens of thou­sands of peo­ple have been forced to evac­u­ate homes across the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia Gov­er­nor Gavin New­som said: “I quite lit­er­ally have no pa­tience for cli­mate change de­niers... It’s com­pletely in­con­sis­tent with the re­al­ity on the ground.”</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia has seen over one mil­lion hectares burned this year – an an­nual record, with nearly four months of fire sea­son still to come.</p>
    <p>More than 14,000 fire­fight­ers are bat­tling 28 ma­jor wild­fires across the coun­try’s most pop­u­lous state.</p>
