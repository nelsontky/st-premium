    <p>It seems al­most serendip­i­tous that Love, Bonito co-founder Rachel Lim was newly ex­pect­ing at the same time that the fash­ion brand made its foray into fam­ily-ori­ented cloth­ing.</p>
    <p>Its first ma­ter­nity line, called Em­brace, re­launched last month with tweaks in styles, ma­te­ri­als and sil­hou­ettes, shortly af­ter the open­ing of its first “fam­ily-friendly” store at VivoCity. The store has fea­tures such as ex­tra wide aisles and mod­u­lar fit­ting rooms that com­bine to fit a stroller.</p>
    <p>“It just hap­pened, to be hon­est,” says the 33-year-old with a laugh. “The pro­duc­tion of the col­lec­tions and the VivoCity store, I could con­trol; I couldn’t con­trol when I be­came preg­nant.”</p>
    <p>“That said, I’m at a stage where I am ready to start a fam­ily, and also sur­rounded by peers and friends go­ing through that life stage,” adds Ms Lim, whose first child is due around Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>In a way, the wom­enswear brand’s growth has al­ways mir­rored her per­sonal jour­ney.</p>
    <p>She co-founded the la­bel as a blogshop called Bonito-Chico when she was fresh out of school and dis­cov­er­ing her­self and her style.</p>
    <p>She found her foot­ing and iden­tity with cloth­ing the same time many Bonito-Chico cus­tomers were strug­gling to.</p>
    <p>“Along the way, as we grew, we had cus­tomers tell us, ‘Thank you for mak­ing me feel con­fi­dent when I needed to go for my first in­ter­view; first job, first pre­sen­ta­tion’,” she re­calls. “That’s when we re­alised we ac­tu­ally play a very big part in our cus­tomer’s lives and jour­neys.”</p>
    <p>As her cus­tomers grew up, the brand cre­ated new of­fer­ings, such as brides­maid dresses, to fit their needs.</p>
    <p>She be­gan dab­bling in ma­ter­nity wear two years ago, af­ter cus­tomers com­plained about not be­ing able to find com­fort­able yet trendy op­tions.</p>
    <p>“What was in the mar­ket were</p>
    <p>As we grew, we had cus­tomers tell us, ‘Thank you for mak­ing me feel con­fi­dent when I needed to go for my first in­ter­view; first job...’. That’s when we re­alised we ac­tu­ally play a very big part in our cus­tomer’s lives and jour­neys.</p>
    <p>LOVE, BONITO CO-FOUNDER RACHEL LIM, on the brand cre­at­ing new of­fer­ings to suit its cus­tomers’ needs, from ma­ter­nity wear (above left) to cloth­ing for boys (cen­tre) and girls (right)</p>
    <p>frumpy, ill-fit­ting pieces that were re­ally ex­pen­sive,” she says. Love, Bonito’s ma­ter­nity col­lec­tion is priced from $36.90 for a top to $56.90 for a kaf­tan dress.</p>
    <p>“Then came kids,” Ms Lim adds, when cus­tomers asked about op­tions to dress their chil­dren in.</p>
    <p>“We re­alised a lot of them are at that stage of their lives – hav­ing fam­i­lies. It felt like a nat­u­ral pro­gres­sion.”</p>
    <p>Love, Bonito re­leased its first kids cloth­ing line in Fe­bru­ary last year.</p>
    <p>While she used to rely on feed­back from preg­nant women on what they wanted in their cloth­ing, it took be­ing a mum-to-be her­self to “fully un­der­stand” ma­ter­nity wear.</p>
    <p>“Now I em­pathise – okay, when we’re preg­nant, we’re very sen­si­tive to heat and cer­tain ma­te­ri­als. So I’m bet­ter in­formed when de­sign­ing the next ma­ter­nity col­lec­tion.”</p>
    <p>With Em­brace, she took into con­sid­er­a­tion de­tails like lin­ing and the stretch of fab­rics, so the clothes can grow in tan­dem with the body.</p>
    <p>Its nam­ing was partly in­spired by her own ex­pe­ri­ence – hav­ing to ac­cept and em­brace “get­ting rounder and swollen an­kles”.</p>
    <p>“We go through so much phys­i­cally and emo­tion­ally,” says Ms Lim, who found out about her preg­nancy at an “un­for­tu­nate time”, at the start of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The name was a con­stant re­minder for me to em­brace my body and changes I’m go­ing through.</p>
    <p>“The least I can do for my­self is dress up and feel bet­ter and more con­fi­dent.”</p>
    <p>As a new mum, shop­ping for chil­dren’s out­fits has also given her a clearer idea on price points and what is lack­ing in the mar­ket. Boys’ cloth­ing, for one.</p>
    <p>“I no­ticed there are a lot of girls’ stuff, maybe be­cause it’s more fun to de­sign – you can add frills, make dresses of dif­fer­ent lengths.”</p>
    <p>Love, Bonito’s new­est kids’ col­lec­tion, which launches next week, will have more uni­sex cloth­ing and op­tions for boys.</p>
    <p>With Covid-19 chang­ing the shop­ping habits of women – like “re­duced de­mand for work­wear” in ex­change for more com­fort­able pieces – she will be piv­ot­ing ac­cord­ingly.</p>
    <p>“At the end of the day, I see my­self also as a Love, Bonito wo­man. We’re a bunch of real women cre­at­ing for other real women – we un­der­stand the strug­gles and the jour­neys women go through,” she says.</p>
    <p>“It’s what has kept us rel­e­vant to our cus­tomers – we evolve ac­cord­ingly with them.”</p>
