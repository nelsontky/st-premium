    <p>An air-con­di­tioned play­ground? An el­e­va­tor ride up from Pink Fish restau­rant, where I can tuck into sal­mon burg­ers after­wards? Three floors above Tokyu Hands store, where I can load up on skincare and sta­tionery? Sign me up.</p>
    <p>That was my re­ac­tion when I was asked to write about Canopy Park, lo­cated on the top floor of Jewel Changi Air­port.</p>
    <p>But on a trip there on Mon­day, I dis­cover that the draws of this park go far be­yond its prox­im­ity to good eat­ing and shop­ping.</p>
    <p>The 14,000 sq m space is framed by a sparkling glass canopy and land­scaped with luscious fo­liage.</p>
    <p>It has gi­ant slides, en­chant­ing mazes, and bounc­ing nets to de­light young and old – and I am some­where in be­tween.</p>
    <p>I head straight for the Dis­cov­ery Slides, which are many things at once – a work of art, a play­ground and a view­ing deck.</p>
    <p>Guests can climb up to a 6.5mhigh view­ing plat­form at the rim, where they can see spec­tac­u­lar views of the sur­round­ing lush green­ery. They can also spi­ral down on the slides. Alas, there is a long line of squeal­ing kids be­fore me.</p>
    <p>Nearby, tod­dlers play amid puffs of cloud and mist at the Foggy Bowls – four con­cave bowls that emit mist, cre­at­ing a dreamy setting.</p>
    <p>While I am decades too old to roll around in the bowls, I watch with vi­car­i­ous de­light.</p>
    <p>I snap lots of pho­tos of the animal-shaped top­i­aries at the</p>
    <p>Top­i­ary Walk. The cheery ele­phant and flam­boy­ant pea­cock are mas­sive draws, but my favourite is a red, open-jawed croc­o­dile, crafted from a mix of fresh and ar­ti­fi­cial plants and pre­served moss.</p>
    <p>These sights can be ac­cessed at a fee of $4.50 for Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents. But there are other, more thrilling at­trac­tions with sep­a­rate ad­mis­sion charges.</p>
    <p>I find the Hedge Maze, billed as Sin­ga­pore’s largest in­door hedge maze, beau­ti­fully land­scaped, with sur­prises around ev­ery cor­ner. Wan­der­ing in it makes me feel like Alice in Won­der­land – mi­nus the blue-and-white dress.</p>
    <p>An­other high­light is the Mir­ror Maze. With plants hang­ing over­head, it feels less claus­tro­pho­bic and eas­ier to nav­i­gate than the typ­i­cal hor­ror-themed house of mir­rors at amuse­ment parks. I con­fess I have been to more than my fair share of those.</p>
    <p>Play­ing at the two Man­ulife Sky</p>
    <p>Nets – one for walk­ing and one for bounc­ing – is also the per­fect op­por­tu­nity to get an adren­a­line rush. How­ever, they are not for every­one – a vis­i­tor who is afraid of heights asks me to ac­com­pany her by hand across the nets to the exit.</p>
    <p>For safe-dis­tanc­ing pur­poses, the park is op­er­at­ing at only up to 50 per cent of its ca­pac­ity. Guests must also wear masks at all times.</p>
    <p>On the whole, the park’s at­trac­tions are var­ied enough to of­fer gen­teel as well as heart-pump­ing air-con­di­tioned fun to both lowand high-en­ergy vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>I have a gem of an af­ter­noon, topped off by burg­ers and bar­gains after­wards.</p>
    <p>Pro tip: If you are afraid of los­ing your bal­ance on the Man­ulife Sky Nets, stay close to the sides. You will be able to grip the sides with your hands.</p>
