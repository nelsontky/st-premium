    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong con­grat­u­lated The Straits Times on its 175th an­niver­sary to­day. This is the mes­sage that he wrote:</p>
    <p>Ever since the ink was printed on its very first issue on 15 July 1845, The Straits Times has un­wa­ver­ingly told the story of Sin­ga­pore for nearly two cen­turies. To­day, it is Sin­ga­pore’s most-read news­pa­per, and makes a pro­found im­pact on our so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>I have fond mem­o­ries of por­ing over the pages of The Straits Times, get­ting my fin­gers black­ened with the ink, when I was grow­ing up. These days, read­ers are just as likely to get their news by sim­ply swip­ing on a screen. The for­mat may have changed, but The Straits Times re­mains true to its mis­sion: De­liv­er­ing the lat­est news and in-depth anal­y­sis on the re­gion and the world. It also pro­vides a key plat­form to dis­cuss the in­ter­ests of our com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>The en­dur­ing le­gacy of The Straits Times tes­ti­fies to the trust that gen­er­a­tions of Sin­ga­pore­ans have placed in it. Un­der the watch­ful stew­ard­ship of its edi­tors, jour­nal­ists and pho­tog­ra­phers, The Straits Times must con­tinue to adapt and mod­ernise it­self, to re­main rel­e­vant to read­ers who now have mul­ti­ple sources of news, views and en­ter­tain­ment, on­line and off­line.</p>
    <p>We have many more chap­ters to write in our Sin­ga­pore Story. May The Straits Times live on to be read and en­joyed by gen­er­a­tions of Sin­ga­pore­ans to come.</p>
    <p>Happy 175th An­niver­sary!</p>
