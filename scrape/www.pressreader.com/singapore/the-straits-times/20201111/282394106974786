    <p>The Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) and the play­ers’ as­so­ci­a­tion (NBPA) have reached an agree­ment in prin­ci­ple on a col­lec­tive bar­gain­ing agree­ment (CBA) for the 2020-21 sea­son, which will be­gin on Dec 22.</p>
    <p>The NBPA last week ap­proved the date for the open­ing of the new sea­son that will have a re­duced 72-game sched­ule.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a meet­ing on Mon­day, the NBPA and the NBA said in a joint state­ment the salary cap would be US$109.14 mil­lion (S$147 mil­lion) and tax level would be US$132.63 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Both fig­ures are un­changed from last term, and de­tails of the games and broad­cast sched­ule will be re­leased later, US me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>“In sub­se­quent sea­sons of the CBA, the salary cap and tax level will in­crease by a min­i­mum of 3 per cent and a max­i­mum of 10 per cent over the prior sea­son,” the league and play­ers’ union added.</p>
    <p>“A new sys­tem will be used to en­sure the par­ties’ agreed-upon split of bas­ket­ball-re­lated in­come.</p>
    <p>“In the event player com­pen­sa­tion were to ex­ceed play­ers’ des­ig­nated share in any sea­son, nec­es­sary salary re­duc­tions be­yond the stan­dard 10 per cent es­crow would be spread across that sea­son and po­ten­tially the fol­low­ing two sea­sons, sub­ject to a max­i­mum salary re­duc­tion in any sea­son of 20 per cent.”</p>
    <p>The agree­ment is sub­ject to a</p>
    <p>Fewer games each team will play in the NBA reg­u­lar sea­son. vote by the league’s Board of Gover­nors.</p>
    <p>Free-agent ne­go­ti­a­tions will be­gin on Nov 20, two days af­ter the draft, and train­ing camps are set to start early next month.</p>
    <p>Last sea­son was com­pleted last month af­ter a four-month de­lay due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, with teams com­pet­ing in a bio-se­cure “bub­ble” at Dis­ney World in Or­lando, Florida.</p>
    <p>The Los An­ge­les Lak­ers cap­tured a record-ty­ing 17th NBA cham­pi­onship with a 106-93 win over the Mi­ami Heat, seal­ing the best-of-seven se­ries 4-2.</p>
