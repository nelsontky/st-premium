    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Nasa’s ef­fort to grab a piece of an asteroid last Tues­day may have worked a lit­tle too well. The spacecraft, Osiris-Rex, grabbed so much rock and dirt that some of the ma­te­rial is now leaking back into space.</p>
    <p>The op­er­a­tion some 320 mil­lion km from Earth on the other side of the Sun was “al­most too suc­cess­ful”, Pro­fes­sor Dante Lau­retta, prin­ci­pal in­ves­ti­ga­tor of the mis­sion, said at a tele­phone news con­fer­ence on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Nasa of­fi­cials wor­ried that with­out care­ful ef­fort to se­cure its samples in the days ahead, the mis­sion could lose much of the sci­en­tific pay­load it trav­elled for years across the so­lar system to gather.</p>
    <p>A few rocks wedged in the robotic probe’s col­lec­tion mech­a­nism pre­vented a flap from fully clos­ing. In im­ages taken by the spacecraft, sci­en­tists could see bits of asteroid com­ing out.</p>
    <p>Prof Lau­retta es­ti­mated that each image showed about 5g to 10g of ma­te­rial float­ing around the col­lec­tor. That is a sig­nif­i­cant loss as the mis­sion’s aim is to bring back at least 60g of asteroid dirt and rocks.</p>
    <p>“You’ve got to re­mem­ber the en­tire system is in mi­cro­grav­ity,” he said. The par­ti­cles move as if in a fluid “and par­ti­cles are kind of dif­fus­ing out”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, vis­ual ev­i­dence sug­gests that the spacecraft gath­ered much more than 60g. Dr Thomas Zur­buchen, the as­so­ciate ad­min­is­tra­tor for sci­ence, said Nasa has de­cided to start prepa­ra­tions for stow­ing the sam­ple.</p>
    <p>If the col­lec­tion at­tempt had not suc­ceeded, Osiris-Rex could have made two more at­tempts.</p>
    <p>Mis­sion man­agers also de­cided to call off two ma­noeu­vres. One, sched­uled for Fri­day, was to slow down the spacecraft and al­low it to re-en</p>
    <p>ter orbit around the asteroid Bennu, which is only about 490m in di­am­e­ter. In­stead, it con­tin­ues to drift away at a speed of less than 1.6kmh.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond one was to spin the spacecraft around yes­ter­day to mea­sure how much is trapped in­side the col­lec­tion mech­a­nism. But that would shake out more ma­te­rial.</p>
    <p>“So that is not a pru­dent path to go down,” Prof Lau­retta said.</p>
    <p>The col­lec­tion of a sam­ple was the key ob­jec­tive of the mis­sion whose full name is Ori­gins, Spec­tral In­ter­pre­ta­tion, Re­source Iden­ti­fi­ca­tion, Se­cu­rity, Re­golith Ex­plorer.</p>
    <p>As­ter­oids are prim­i­tive 4.5 billion-year-old leftovers from the ear­li­est days of the so­lar system. Sci­en­tists on Earth us­ing so­phis­ti­cated in­stru­ments would be able to study the Bennu ma­te­rial in much more de­tail than any in­stru­ments on the spacecraft could.</p>
    <p>Last Tues­day, the spacecraft’s col­lec­tion mech­a­nism touched the asteroid Bennu at a leisurely pace of about 4cm a sec­ond. The sam­pling mech­a­nism, which re­sem­bles an au­to­mo­bile air fil­ter, had been de­signed to work on a wide va­ri­ety of sur­faces rang­ing from com­pletely rigid – “Like run­ning into a slab of con­crete,” said Prof Lau­retta – to some­thing much more por­ous.</p>
    <p>That part of Bennu turned out to be on the softer side, with the asteroid hardly push­ing back at all. The sam­pling mech­a­nism pushed 25cm to 50cm into the soil be­fore the spacecraft backed away, al­low­ing it to fill up its col­lec­tor when a burst of ni­tro­gen gas from the probe stirred up the surface.</p>
    <p>“We could not have per­formed a bet­ter col­lec­tion ex­per­i­ment,” Prof Lau­retta said.</p>
    <p>The op­er­a­tion to stow the col­lec­tion mech­a­nism may start on Tues­day. Engi­neers are look­ing at how to mod­ify the pro­ce­dure to min­imise the amount of ma­te­rial that may be shaken out into space. It will take sev­eral days be­fore the samples are safely stored in a re­turn cap­sule.</p>
    <p>Osiris-Rex must wait un­til March to leave Bennu and re­turn to Earth, a jour­ney that will take 21/ years.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>The spacecraft will drop off the re­turn cap­sule, which will parachute to a land­ing in Utah on Sept 24, 2023.</p>
    <p>Osiris-Rex is the third mis­sion to at­tempt to bring back pieces of an asteroid.</p>
    <p>A Ja­panese mis­sion, Hayabusa, faced a series of tech­ni­cal mal­func­tions and it barely man­aged to bring back any samples – about 1,500 grains – from an asteroid it was study­ing called Itokawa.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese space agency sent a sec­ond mis­sion, Hayabusa2, to a dif­fer­ent asteroid, Ryugu. That spacecraft is on its way back to Earth and will drop its asteroid pay­load in the Aus­tralian Out­back in De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>As­ter­oids are prim­i­tive</p>
    <p>4.5 billion-year-old leftovers from the ear­li­est days of the so­lar system. Sci­en­tists on Earth us­ing so­phis­ti­cated in­stru­ments would be able to study the Bennu ma­te­rial in much more de­tail than any in­stru­ments on the spacecraft could.</p>
