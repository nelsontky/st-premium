    <p>•</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, four dozen lawyers, ac­coun­tants and bankers from all over Latin Amer­ica piled into a con­fer­ence room in an of­fice tower on Mi­ami Wa­ter­front. They lis­tened, spell­bound, as Mr Ni­cholas Chen, an en­er­getic lawyer who had come all the way from Tai­wan, told them about an ex­o­dus of man­u­fac­tur­ing from China that could make them rich.</p>
    <p>“The tsunami wa­ters are flow­ing out­ward now,” Mr Chen said to the au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>Point­ing to the United States’ trade war with China, he said many com­pa­nies were hav­ing sec­ond thoughts about main­tain­ing oper­a­tions in the Asian coun­try. “Huge num­bers of China-lo­cated com­pa­nies are shift­ing their pur­chase or­ders, man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­i­ties and oper­a­tions out of China,” he claimed. “This can be­come your El Do­rado!” – a ref­er­ence to the myth­i­cal gold trea­sure that drove gen­er­a­tions of ex­plor­ers to Latin Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>Mr Chen knows how to make a good pitch. Start­ing in the early 1990s, the Chi­nese-Amer­i­can lawyer helped hun­dreds of com­pa­nies from Tai­wan, a hub of man­u­fac­tur­ing for elec­tron­ics and other industries, set up shop in Suzhou – a city just out­side Shang­hai, in Jiangsu prov­ince.</p>
    <p>The in­flux into Suzhou be­came one of the largest clus­ters of Tai­wanese man­u­fac­tur­ing in China, with more than 11,000 com­pa­nies and cu­mu­la­tive in­vest­ment of more than US$30 bil­lion (S$40.81 bil­lion) as of 2018. The com­pa­nies in­cluded flat-panel maker AU Op­tron­ics, telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions gear maker Ser­comm and at least 10 Ap­ple sup­pli­ers. They were part of a force that trans­formed China into an ex­port ma­chine sup­ply­ing the whole world – un­til now.</p>
    <p>Those same sup­ply chains are now at the cen­tre of a tug-of-war that has huge im­pli­ca­tions for the fu­ture of the global econ­omy and for geopol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>Driven by US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s push to “de­cou­ple” the Amer­i­can econ­omy from China and the dis­rup­tions caused by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, many man­u­fac­tur­ers are be­ing forced to re­think their pres­ence in China.</p>
    <p>Un­tan­gling sup­ply chains that have built up over a gen­er­a­tion is a com­plex and dif­fi­cult task, and the multi­na­tional com­pa­nies which sell into the Chi­nese mar­ket will stay and even ex­pand. But if com­pa­nies that once used the main­land to make goods for ex­port do de­cide to depart in sig­nif­i­cant num­bers, it will rep­re­sent a ma­jor re­ver­sal of five decades of eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion be­tween the US and China.</p>
    <p>At a time when ten­sions be­tween Washington and Bei­jing are in­creas­ingly be­gin­ning to re­sem­ble a new Cold War, prod­ucts rang­ing from com­puter servers to the Ap­ple iPhone could end up hav­ing two sep­a­rate sup­ply chains – one for the Chi­nese mar­ket and one for much of the rest of the world.</p>
    <p>“In the past, there would be one mas­sive plant in China for the whole world. But that glob­al­i­sa­tion is gone,” says Tai­wanese in­vest­ment banker C.Y. Huang, an ad­viser on a num­ber of deals which have con­trib­uted to dis­en­tan­gling global sup­ply chains from China. “It will be more costly, and it will be less ef­fi­cient. But it is the way that pol­i­tics is push­ing us.”</p>
    <p>Fox­conn, the US$178 bil­lion Tai­wanese com­pany which makes the iPhone and just about ev­ery other tech gad­get and which has a work­force of close to one mil­lion peo­ple in China, says it ex­pects man­u­fac­tur­ing to frag­ment into a China sup­ply chain and sev­eral oth­ers for the rest of the world.</p>
    <p>“The past model, where (man­u­fac­tur­ing) is con­cen­trated in just a few coun­tries like a world fac­tory will no longer ex­ist,” Fox­conn chair­man Young Liu said at a con­fer­ence in June. “What we think is more likely in the fu­ture are re­gional pro­duc­tion net­works.”</p>
    <p>COSTS MAT­TER</p>
    <p>Driven by US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s push to “de­cou­ple” the Amer­i­can econ­omy from China and the dis­rup­tions caused by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, many man­u­fac­tur­ers are be­ing forced to re­think their pres­ence in China. Un­tan­gling sup­ply chains that have built up over a gen­er­a­tion is a com­plex and dif­fi­cult task and the multi­na­tional com­pa­nies which sell into the Chi­nese mar­ket will stay and even ex­pand. But if com­pa­nies that once used the main­land to make goods for ex­port do de­cide to depart in sig­nif­i­cant num­bers, it will rep­re­sent a ma­jor re­ver­sal of five decades of eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion be­tween the US and China.</p>
    <p>There is plenty of ev­i­dence that many com­pa­nies are cool­ing on China. Ac­cord­ing to sur­veys con­ducted by the Amer­i­can Cham­ber of Com­merce in China over the past two years, about 40 per cent of US com­pa­nies in China have moved man­u­fac­tur­ing fa­cil­i­ties out of the coun­try al­ready or are con­sid­er­ing do­ing so.</p>
    <p>In the cham­ber’s lat­est an­nual sur­vey, pub­lished last month, only 28 per cent of mem­ber com­pa­nies said their in­vest­ment in China would in­crease this year – down from 48 per cent last year, around 60 per cent in the two pre­ced­ing years, and 81 per cent in 2016.</p>
    <p>To in­dus­try ex­ec­u­tives and ex­perts fol­low­ing sup­ply chains, none of this comes as a sur­prise. “The first dy­namic at work here is cost con­trol, and it has been a fac­tor for 12 to 15 years,” says Mr Ben Simpfendor­fer, founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of con­sul­tancy Silk Road As­so­ciates.</p>
    <p>Tai­wanese com­pa­nies, among the ear­li­est and largest in­vestors in China, be­gan to ad­just their man­u­fac­tur­ing set-up as early as 15 years ago, when labour started be­com­ing scarce in the coastal re­gions where most for­eign in­vest­ment is con­cen­trated. Footwear, ac­ces­sories, toy and fur­ni­ture man­u­fac­tur­ers be­gan mov­ing to South-east Asian coun­tries – such as Viet­nam and Cam­bo­dia – more than a decade ago.</p>
    <p>Western com­pa­nies have also come to fear that mak­ing equip­ment in China might put data se­cu­rity and pri­vacy at risk. As Washington stepped up its scru­tiny of Chi­nese tele­com gear mak­ers ZTE and Huawei, be­gan to in­dict Chi­nese hack­ers and started dis­cussing if even com­puter hard­ware might be com­pro­mised, con­tract man­u­fac­tur­ers of servers such as Tai­wan-based Quanta Com­puter started mov­ing some pro­duc­tion back home, and some to the US or Mex­ico.</p>
    <p>This process was al­ready hap­pen­ing prior to the US-China trade war. “If you sup­ply Google or Face­book, you need to show that it’s a non-China prod­uct,” says Mr Simpfendor­fer.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan has been one of the big­gest ben­e­fi­cia­ries of Amer­ica’s grow­ing wari­ness about do­ing business in China. The Tai­wanese gov­ern­ment, long con­cerned about the coun­try’s eco­nomic over-de­pen­dence on China, has grabbed the op­por­tu­nity and has of­fered sub­si­dies for Tai­wanese com­pa­nies that bring some oper­a­tions back home.</p>
    <p>Un­der that ini­tia­tive, Taipei has reg­is­tered more than NT$1.12 tril­lion (S$53 bil­lion) in in­vest­ment com­mit­ments over the past two years. Man­u­fac­tur­ers of tele­com net­work­ing gear, servers and in­te­grated circuits have been among the largest projects com­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>As the US-China trade war heated up, con­sumer elec­tron­ics com­pa­nies also started to re­think their China oper­a­tions. Over the past few years, Tai­wanese com­pa­nies have been sell­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing as­sets in China to Chi­nese com­peti­tors at an in­creas­ing pace. Those deals in­clude the re­cent ac­qui­si­tion of a China-based plant of smart­phone case maker Casetek by Chi­nese com­pany Lens for NT$43.3 bil­lion, the sale of two China plants of Tai­wan iPhone sup­plier Wistron to China’s Luxshare, and the trans­fer of China as­sets of Ap­ple ear­phone maker Merry to Luxshare.</p>
    <p>“Luxshare has be­come a mini-Fox­conn. A lot of this ac­tiv­ity is hap­pen­ing be­cause of the reshuf­fling of the sup­ply chain,” says Mr Huang. “These com­pa­nies are all sup­pli­ers of Ap­ple, and Ap­ple is now sep­a­rat­ing the sup­ply chain for China and non-China.”</p>
    <p>Mr Huang be­lieves even</p>
    <p>Fox­conn might at some point have to sell its mas­sive China-based assem­bly plants. “In the fu­ture, Ap­ple wants to del­e­gate sup­ply­ing of the China mar­ket to Chi­nese sup­pli­ers. The other mar­kets in the world can be han­dled by Tai­wanese sup­pli­ers,” he says.</p>
    <p>While all these fac­tors were al­ready un­der con­sid­er­a­tion, ex­ec­u­tives and an­a­lysts say the pan­demic has made them much more acute.</p>
    <p>“When China or­dered fac­to­ries to keep closed af­ter Lu­nar New Year to con­tain the spread of the virus, that was the moment of truth for so many com­pa­nies,” says a con­sul­tant who works with man­u­fac­tur­ers in Greater China. “For a while, ev­ery­one was fo­cused on get­ting through the cri­sis, but now that the econ­omy is run­ning again in China, these com­pa­nies are busy re­build­ing sup­ply chains,” he says.</p>
    <p>“The num­ber one pri­or­ity is to find and qual­ify al­ter­na­tive sup­pli­ers you can fall back on to if some­thing like this hap­pens again.”</p>
    <p>At the same time, the pan­demic has brought med­i­cal sup­plies into the group of industries tra­di­tion­ally sen­si­tive to na­tional se­cu­rity con­cerns such as de­fence, telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions and tech­nol­ogy. From the US to Ja­pan to Europe to Aus­tralia, gov­ern­ments are pon­der­ing how to bring pro­duc­tion of cru­cial items such as per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals back home.</p>
    <p>That pres­sure is al­ready forc­ing a shift in man­u­fac­tur­ing or­ders. Wistron Med­i­cal Tech­nol­ogy, a sub­sidiary of the Tai­wanese con­tract elec­tron­ics man­u­fac­turer, says it so far han­dles 70 per cent of its pro­duc­tion out of its fac­tory in the Chi­nese city of Chongqing, and only the re­main­ing 30 per cent out of Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>“But for our largest or­der, which is from the US gov­ern­ment, we have al­ready been no­ti­fied that the next batch can no longer come out of China,” says vice-pres­i­dent Brian Chuang. “That shift will push China-based pro­duc­tion un­der 50 per cent in our over­all man­u­fac­tur­ing bal­ance.”</p>
    <p>‘TWENTY-YEAR PROCESS’</p>
    <p>Not ev­ery­where can ad­just­ments be made this eas­ily.</p>
    <p>Ms Anne Pet­terd, a part­ner at law firm Baker & McKen­zie in Syd­ney who fo­cuses on sup­ply chain is­sues, says some com­pa­nies are hold­ing back from mak­ing big de­ci­sions be­fore the US elec­tion. “Com­pa­nies still think that the same would be</p>
    <p>hap­pen­ing un­der a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion,” she says. “But if there were a change in gov­ern­ment, they might have a bit more cer­tainty and pre­dictabil­ity.”</p>
    <p>Some com­pa­nies are wait­ing to see if they will be awarded ex­emp­tions from US trade tar­iffs be­fore they make long-term de­ci­sions about pro­duc­tion in</p>
    <p>China. Most im­por­tantly, many man­u­fac­tur­ers may strug­gle to build new oper­a­tions in coun­tries other than China be­cause they lack the coun­try’s ma­te­rial, com­po­nent sup­pli­ers and sur­round­ing ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“Some man­u­fac­tur­ers have long done some fi­nal assem­bly in coun­tries closer to the end mar­ket, for ex­am­ple in Mex­ico for the US mar­ket, but it takes time to pro­ceed from ‘Level 10’ assem­bly to Level 5 or 6,” says the con­sul­tant, re­fer­ring to a stage of pro­duc­tion where key com­po­nents are put to­gether rather than just fi­nal assem­bly and test­ing.</p>
    <p>Trade ex­perts cau­tion that the shift of global sup­ply chains away from their sole re­liance on China will take a long time. While China’s share of global ex­ports markedly dropped last year as a re­sult of trade war-re­lated ad­just­ments, the coun­try’s share of global ex­ports hit a new his­toric high this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Simpfendor­fer says monthly trade data is not a good in­di­ca­tor for the longer-term shifts un­der way, es­pe­cially be­cause Covid-19 has dis­torted de­mand struc­ture. For in­stance, the fact that hun­dreds of mil­lions of peo­ple are work­ing from home has cre­ated sud­den new large de­mand for lap­tops and tablets – prod­ucts for which the big­gest ca­pac­ity is in China.</p>
    <p>“The sup­ply chain shifts un­der way now are com­pa­ra­ble to the shift of pro­duc­tion by North-east Asian com­pa­nies from Ja­pan, South Korea and Tai­wan into China in the</p>
    <p>1990s,” he says. “It was a 20-year process then, and it will be a</p>
    <p>20-year process now.”</p>
    <p>MUL­TI­PLE NET­WORKS</p>
    <p>Watch­ing the his­toric shifts un­der way, gov­ern­ments are try­ing to take advantage. “Some coun­tries are start­ing to hand out in­cen­tives for com­pa­nies to come home,” says econ­o­mist and pro­fes­sor emer­i­tus Jung Ku-hyun from Seoul’s Yon­sei Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>He pre­dicts that the scope for reshoring is lim­ited, and that in­stead three large sup­ply chain sys­tems will form: the largest one in Asia, in­clud­ing China but reach­ing down to South-east Asia, and two smaller ones cen­tred on the US and Ger­many.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan has of­fered its com­pa­nies</p>
    <p>in­cen­tives to bring pro­duc­tion home, and has a sep­a­rate set of in­cen­tives for man­u­fac­tur­ers that move pro­duc­tion from China to South-east Asia. The Euro­pean Union has a re­view of its trade pol­icy un­der way to look at how it could deal with sup­ply chain re­struc­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>Last month, the EU’s rep­re­sen­ta­tive of­fice in Tai­wan or­gan­ised a con­fer­ence on in­vest­ing in Europe for the first time, as var­i­ous coun­tries – es­pe­cially in cen­tral and east­ern Europe – hope to be­come new man­u­fac­tur­ing hubs.</p>
    <p>The US, mean­while, is kick­ing off a new eco­nomic di­a­logue with Taipei fo­cused on re­jig­ging global sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>Mr Huang, the in­vest­ment banker, last month launched an ini­tia­tive called Re!Chain, aimed at help­ing Tai­wanese com­pa­nies rein­vent them­selves amid the rapid change.</p>
    <p>He is bring­ing to­gether en­ter­prises – in­clud­ing Fair Friend Group, the world’s third-largest ma­chine tool maker, WPG, the world’s largest in­te­grated cir­cuit dis­trib­u­tor, and Teco, Tai­wan’s largest au­toma­tion provider.</p>
    <p>In­stead of of­fer­ing cheap man­u­fac­tur­ing ser­vices in China, he ex­pects them to man­age smart global sup­ply chains with the help of au­toma­tion, ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and blockchain.</p>
    <p>He says: “My as­sump­tion is that Tai­wan should be­come the co­or­di­nat­ing cen­tre in the global sup­ply chain.”</p>
    <p>Mr Chen, mean­while, is go­ing back to his roots. Now 63, he is plan­ning to re­turn to the China-based in­dus­trial parks which he helped fill up more than 30 years ago – to con­vince com­pa­nies to build ad­di­tional pro­duc­tion fa­cil­i­ties in new coun­tries. “I will repli­cate those in­dus­trial clus­ters else­where,” he says.</p>
    <p>Mr Chen be­lieves north­ern Mex­ico’s time has come. “It was still cheaper to man­u­fac­ture in China 10 years ago than in maquilado­ras,” he re­calls, in a ref­er­ence to Mex­ico’s ex­port pro­cess­ing fac­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to him, in­dus­trial park man­agers from Nuevo Leon, a Mex­i­can state bor­der­ing Texas, used to try to con­vince him to bring over com­pa­nies from China, but could never match the cost struc­ture that China of­fered.</p>
    <p>“Now I’m telling them that you still can’t come up with that num­ber, but you don’t have to, be­cause they have had the trade war, cost in­creases and Covid-19, so their num­ber changed. Do you still want to talk now?”</p>
