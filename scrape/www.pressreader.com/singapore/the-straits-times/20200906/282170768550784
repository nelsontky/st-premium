    <p>TOUGH TIMES AHEAD</p>
    <p>BARCELONA • Lionel Messi’s grudg­ing ac­cep­tance that he will have to stay put at Barcelona af­ter los­ing his stand-off with club pres­i­dent Josep Maria Bar­tomeu has left the Ar­gen­tinian su­per­star’s fu­ture still in doubt.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old, who was ab­sent from train­ing yes­ter­day – the day af­ter an­nounc­ing that he would re­luc­tantly stay at the club – launched a sting­ing at­tack on Bar­tomeu claim­ing that he had bro­ken his word to let him leave.</p>
    <p>The ab­sence of any new con­tract means that even if Messi is not al­lowed to leave this sum­mer, he could en­ter into ne­go­ti­a­tions with other teams from Jan 1 and leave for free when his cur­rent deal ex­pires in July.</p>
    <p>The feel­ing that his re­luc­tant de­ci­sion was by no means the end of the af­fair was clear in Span­ish daily</p>
    <p>Marca’s head­line: “Messi stays, the cri­sis too”.</p>
    <p>Bar­tomeu could yet re­spond with his res­ig­na­tion, hav­ing pre­vi­ously in­di­cated that he would step down if the player pub­licly said he was the prob­lem and agreed to stay.</p>
    <p>Messi re­vealed in an ex­clu­sive in­ter­view with Goal on Fri­day that he felt his ini­tial de­ci­sion to leave was in the best in­ter­ests of the club. “I needed it, the club needed it and it was good for ev­ery­one,” he said.</p>
    <p>Messi’s de­par­ture would have eased some of the club’s fi­nan­cial prob­lems. De­spite Barca be­ing the world’s rich­est club, ac­cord­ing to the Deloitte Money League, play­ers took a 70 per cent pay cut be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The club have a wage bill of €671 mil­lion (S$1.08 bil­lion) in an era when their rev­enues have been hit by the lack of gate re­ceipts and when new Dutch man­ager Ron­ald Koe­man is try­ing to over­haul the squad.</p>
    <p>Yet they will need to fork out €150 mil­lion gross for Messi to stay another year. He would also qual­ify to re­ceive a loy­alty bonus of €70 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Messi be­lieved he had a clause in his con­tract that meant he could leave for free at the end of last sea­son but Barca said that the op­tion ex­pired on June 10.</p>
    <p>“The pres­i­dent al­ways said that at the end of the sea­son I could de­cide if I wanted to go or if I wanted to stay and in the end he didn’t end up keep­ing his word,” Messi told Goal.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Span­ish foot­ball ex­pert Guillem Balague, the soured re­la­tion­ship means Barca may have won a hol­low bat­tle but could lose the war.</p>
    <p>“I’m not sure we have heard the end of this saga yet,” he wrote in his col­umn for the BBC.</p>
    <p>“Koe­man and Barcelona are go­ing to have to get used to work­ing with a player who claims he has been de­ceived by the club pres­i­dent, a player who has made it abun­dantly clear he wants to leave, and a player who has openly stated he is un­happy.”</p>
    <p>Koe­man and Barcelona are go­ing to have to get used to work­ing with a player who claims he has been de­ceived by the club pres­i­dent...</p>
    <p>GUILLEM BALAGUE, Span­ish foot­ball ex­pert, on the im­pact of keep­ing a re­luc­tant Lionel Messi for one more sea­son.</p>
