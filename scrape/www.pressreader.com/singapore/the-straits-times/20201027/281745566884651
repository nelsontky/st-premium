    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON De­spite trail­ing in the polls barely one week from elec­tion day, US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump was yes­ter­day set to cel­e­brate a likely mon­u­men­tal vic­tory for the con­ser­va­tive cause: the con­fir­ma­tion of his third nom­i­nee for the US Supreme Court.</p>
    <p>Ap­pel­late Judge Amy Coney Bar­rett is all but cer­tain to be­come the ninth jus­tice on the na­tion’s high­est court, af­ter Democrats failed to de­rail the con­tentious process in a sharply di­vided Se­nate.</p>
    <p>In a rare Sun­day ses­sion, the Se­nate’s Re­pub­li­can ma­jor­ity over­came a fil­i­buster by Democrats, and Mrs Bar­rett’s nom­i­na­tion cleared a pro­ce­dural hur­dle, 51-48, to set up a con­fir­ma­tion vote due last night.</p>
    <p>“By to­mor­row night, we’ll have a new mem­ber of the United States Supreme Court,” Se­nate Ma­jor­ity Leader Mitch McCon­nell told the cham­ber. “The other side won’t be able to do much about this for a long time to come.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Bar­rett’s as­cen­sion to the seat left va­cant by the Sept 18 death of lib­eral icon Ruth Bader Gins­burg would lock in a 6-to-3 con­ser­va­tive ma­jor­ity on the high court.</p>
    <p>Democrats have warned that Mrs Bar­rett, 48, could vote to gut Oba­macare, which has helped mil­lions of Amer­i­cans gain health in­sur­ance, and per­haps over­turn Roe v Wade, the land­mark 1973 de­ci­sion pro­tect­ing abor­tion rights.</p>
    <p>They have been left steam­ing over the process. Se­nate Re­pub­li­cans had blocked then Pres­i­dent Barack Obama’s Supreme Court pick in March 2016, ar­gu­ing that it was too close to an elec­tion eight months away. But when Mr Trump nom­i­nated Mrs Bar­rett 38 days be­fore the 2020 elec­tion, Re­pub­li­cans em­braced the move.</p>
    <p>Top Se­nate Demo­crat Chuck Schumer called the con­fir­ma­tion rush a “glar­ing hypocrisy” that would leave “an in­erasable stain on this Re­pub­li­can ma­jor­ity”.</p>
    <p>Two other Trump nom­i­nees for the Supreme Court – Mr Neil Gor­such in 2017 and Mr Brett Ka­vanaugh in 2018 – were con­firmed af­ter bit­ter par­ti­san fights.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s first term has been con­tro­ver­sial, but his Supreme Court con­fir­ma­tions are “at the top of the heap” of ac­com­plish­ments, Re­pub­li­can Se­na­tor Mar­sha Blackburn told Fox News.</p>
    <p>The process has moved with un­com­mon speed, tak­ing just 30 days from Mrs Bar­rett’s nom­i­na­tion to her likely con­fir­ma­tion – less than half the 69.6-day av­er­age from nom­i­na­tion to fi­nal Se­nate vote.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, who is trail­ing his Demo­cratic chal­lenger Joe Bi­den in the opin­ion polls, has said he wants Mrs Bar­rett con­firmed be­fore the Nov 3 vote and in place in the event the court hears an elec­tion-re­lated chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Two Re­pub­li­can sen­a­tors, Ms Su­san Collins of Maine and Alaska’s Ms Lisa Murkowski, voted against mov­ing for­ward af­ter say­ing that they op­posed con­firm­ing a jus­tice so close to an elec­tion.</p>
    <p>But in a turn­about last Satur­day, Ms Murkowski told col­leagues she would vote to con­firm Mrs Bar­rett given that there was no chance of block­ing the process. “While I op­pose the process that has led us to this point, I do not hold it against her as an in­di­vid­ual,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mr McCon­nell had pri­ori­tised the con­fir­ma­tion over all other Se­nate busi­ness, in­clud­ing a new Bill to pro­vide relief to mil­lions of Amer­i­cans and com­pa­nies rav­aged by the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The out­break has brought a new wrin­kle to the process. Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence, who also has a con­sti­tu­tional role as Se­nate pres­i­dent, was ex­pected to pre­side over yes­ter­day’s vote though his chief of staff – and re­port­edly oth­ers in Mr Pence’s cir­cle – was di­ag­nosed with Covid-19 this past week­end.</p>
    <p>Mr Pence, who tested neg­a­tive for the virus ac­cord­ing to a spokesman on Sun­day, will main­tain his sched­ule. That drew as­ton­ish­ment from Mr Schumer, who warned that Mr Pence’s de­ci­sion puts sen­a­tors and staffers at risk.</p>
    <p>“The Re­pub­li­can Party is will­ing to ig­nore the pan­demic to rush this Supreme Court nom­i­na­tion for­ward,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Trump and Mr Bi­den are down to the fi­nal full week of cam­paign­ing be­fore the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump yes­ter­day headed to Penn­syl­va­nia, a crit­i­cal swing state be­ing heav­ily courted with fre­quent vis­its by both can­di­dates, and is set for mul­ti­ple trips to Michi­gan, Penn­syl­va­nia and Wis­con­sin this week.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den is sched­uled to travel to Ge­or­gia to­day. That push in the South­ern state, which went for Mr Trump in 2016 by about 5 per­cent­age points and has not backed a Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date since 1992, shows Mr Bi­den’s ef­fort to ex­pand his party’s reach.</p>
    <p>De­spite Mr Bi­den’s solid lead in the polls, the con­test in the most crit­i­cal bat­tle­ground states such as Florida and Penn­syl­va­nia that could de­cide the out­come ap­pears closer.</p>
    <p>By to­mor­row night, we’ll have a new mem­ber of the United States Supreme Court.</p>
    <p>The other side won’t be able to do much about this for a long time to come.</p>
