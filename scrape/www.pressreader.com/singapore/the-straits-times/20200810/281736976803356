    <p>NEW YORK • US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump took ex­ec­u­tive ac­tion on Satur­day to cir­cum­vent Congress and try to ex­tend an ar­ray of fed­eral pan­demic re­lief, re­sort­ing to a legally du­bi­ous set of edicts whose im­pact was un­clear, as ne­go­ti­a­tions over an eco­nomic re­cov­ery pack­age ap­peared on the brink of col­lapse.</p>
    <p>It was not clear what author­ity Mr Trump had to act on his own on the mea­sures or what im­me­di­ate ef­fect they would have, given that Congress con­trols fed­eral spend­ing.</p>
    <p>But his de­ci­sion to sign the mea­sures – billed as a fed­eral evic­tion ban, a pay­roll tax sus­pen­sion, re­lief for stu­dent bor­row­ers and US$400 (S$550) a week for the job­less – re­flected the fail­ure of two weeks of talks be­tween White House of­fi­cials and top con­gres­sional Democrats to strike a deal on a broad re­lief plan as cru­cial ben­e­fits have ex­pired with no res­o­lu­tion in sight.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s move also il­lus­trated the height­ened con­cern of a pres­i­dent star­ing down re-elec­tion in the mid­dle of a his­toric re­ces­sion and a pan­demic, de­ter­mined to show vot­ers that he was do­ing some­thing to ad­dress the crises.</p>
    <p>But de­spite his as­ser­tions on Satur­day that his ac­tions “will take care of this en­tire sit­u­a­tion”, the or­ders also leave a num­ber of crit­i­cal bi­par­ti­san fund­ing pro­pos­als un­ad­dressed, in­clud­ing pro­vid­ing as­sis­tance to small busi­nesses, bil­lions of dol­lars to schools be­fore the new school year, aid to states and cities, and a sec­ond round of US$1,200 stim­u­lus cheques to Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>“Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have cho­sen to hold this vi­tal as­sis­tance hostage,” Mr Trump said, sav­aging the two top Democrats and their US$3.4 tril­lion open­ing of­fer dur­ing a news con­fer­ence at his pri­vate golf club in New Jersey, his sec­ond in two days.</p>
    <p>“We’ve had it,” he added, ac­cus­ing the Democrats of hold­ing up ne­go­ti­a­tions with de­mands for pro­vi­sions that ap­peared to have lit­tle to do with the pan­demic, although he made lit­tle men­tion of com­pa­ra­ble items in the US$1 tril­lion pro­posal Repub­li­cans un­veiled last month.</p>
    <p>Democrats have re­fused to agree to that plan, press­ing in­stead for a far more ex­pan­sive eco­nomic re­lief pack­age, at least twice as large, that would pro­vide bil­lions more for states and cities and food aid, and re­vive the lapsed US$600-per­week en­hanced fed­eral job­less aid pay­ments. Repub­li­cans are propos­ing to re­vive the pay­ments but at a rate of US$400 a week.</p>
    <p>It was un­clear whether the ef­fort to by­pass Congress would kill the al­ready stalled talks al­to­gether, though Mr Trump told re­porters he would be open to con­tin­u­ing the dis­cus­sions.</p>
    <p>“We’re dis­ap­pointed that i nstead of putting in the work to solve Amer­i­cans’ prob­lems, the Pres­i­dent in­stead chose to stay on his lux­ury golf course to an­nounce un­work­able, weak and nar­row pol­icy an­nounce­ments to slash the un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits that mil­lions des­per­ately need and en­dan­ger se­niors’ So­cial Se­cu­rity and Medi­care,” Speaker Pelosi and Se­na­tor Schumer said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>They called on Repub­li­cans to “re­turn to the ta­ble” to con­tinue ne­go­ti­at­ing and “meet us half­way”.</p>
    <p>It was un­clear if the aid would even ma­te­ri­alise if law­suits are filed chal­leng­ing the le­gal­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump walked away from the lectern af­ter re­porters ques­tioned his claim that he had the abil­ity to cir­cum­vent Congress.</p>
    <p>Sign­ing the or­ders was a fa­mil­iar tactic from a pres­i­dent who has por­trayed him­self as the ul­ti­mate deal-maker but in prac­tice has shown lit­tle in­ter­est in or skill for ne­go­ti­at­ing with Congress, bristling against the lim­i­ta­tions of his power.</p>
    <p>It re­called his de­ci­sion in 2018 to shut down the govern­ment over his de­mand for fund­ing for a wall on the south-west­ern bor­der, his sig­na­ture cam­paign prom­ise, in an ef­fort to force Democrats to agree to the money.</p>
    <p>They never did, and the Pres­i­dent ul­ti­mately de­clared a na­tional emer­gency to di­vert other fed­eral money to fund it him­self, a move that drew le­gal chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the event on Satur­day, the White House re­leased texts of the mea­sures – one ex­ec­u­tive or­der and three mem­o­ran­dums – which in­cluded sev­eral flour­ishes that read like po­lit­i­cal doc­u­ments in ac­cus­ing Democrats of play­ing games.</p>
    <p>One in­voked the Stafford Act, a fed­eral dis­as­ter re­lief statute, to di­vert money from a home­land se­cu­rity fund and al­low states to use money al­ready al­lo­cated by Congress to help peo­ple who have been laid off amid the pan­demic, ef­fec­tively al­low­ing them to ap­ply for dis­as­ter re­lief to cover lost wages. The mech­a­nism would pull from the same fund that cov­ers nat­u­ral dis­as­ters in the mid­dle of what is ex­pected to be a highly active hur­ri­cane sea­son.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump said the ac­tion would pro­vide US$400 weekly in en­hanced un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits, US$200 less than laid-off work­ers had been re­ceiv­ing un­der ben­e­fits that lapsed at the end of last month. But with states be­ing di­rected to pick up US$100 of that aid, the fed­eral amount would be no more than US$300 a week.</p>
    <p>He also retroac­tively signed a mem­o­ran­dum sus­pend­ing the pay­roll tax from Aug 1 to the end of this year, although the or­der would just de­fer the pay­ment of the taxes.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has vowed that if re­elected in Novem­ber, he would ex­tend the de­fer­ral and the pay­ments. If he tried to make a pay­roll tax cut per­ma­nent, it would have a dras­tic ef­fect on the fund­ing of So­cial Se­cu­rity, which he has pre­vi­ously promised not to cut.</p>
    <p>His mem­o­ran­dum seek­ing to re­pur­pose other money to cover lost wages is un­likely to de­liver ad­di­tional cash to laid-off work­ers any time soon, and economists say the pay­roll tax col­lec­tions sus­pen­sion is also un­likely to bol­ster work­ers’ pay cheques be­cause it is only a de­lay in tax li­a­bil­ity.</p>
