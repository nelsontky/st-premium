    <p>About 980 staff and ten­ants of hawker cen­tres and cof­fee shops, as well as food de­liv­ery rid­ers, are ex­pected to be swabbed for Covid-19 at the week­end. The Health Min­istry said that the com­mu­nity groups were iden­ti­fied be­cause of their high fre­quency of in­ter­ac­tion with mem­bers of the public.</p>
    <p>About 980 work­ers and ten­ants of hawker cen­tres and cof­fee shops, as well as food de­liv­ery work­ers, are ex­pected to be swabbed for Covid-19 at the week­end.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times, the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency, Sin­ga­pore Food Agency and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore said yes­ter­day that the tests will take place at the pavil­ion be­side Block 75 Marine Drive and at the open plaza in front of Block 50A Marine Ter­race.</p>
    <p>The tests are part of a larger ini­tia­tive that the Min­istry of Health (MOH) an­nounced on Aug 29 which in­volves of­fer­ing one-time poly­merase chain re­ac­tion tests to com­mu­nity groups such as taxi and pri­vate-hire car driv­ers, food de­liv­ery work­ers and key ven­dors ser­vic­ing for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>MOH said that the com­mu­nity groups were iden­ti­fied due to their high fre­quency of in­ter­ac­tion with mem­bers of the public. It added that the tests are be­ing car­ried out to pro­vide a bet­ter pic­ture of the preva­lence of the virus in the pop­u­la­tion at large.</p>
    <p>MOH said that tests un­der this ini­tia­tive are vol­un­tary as there has been no lo­cal ev­i­dence that the iden­ti­fied com­mu­nity groups are at higher risk of get­ting in­fected.</p>
    <p>This week­end’s tests are be­ing of­fered to stall­hold­ers, stall as­sis­tants and clean­ers work­ing at seven se­lected cof­fee shops in the Marine Pa­rade and Joo Chiat area, as well as those in the Block 84 Marine Pa­rade Cen­tral, Block 50A Marine Ter­race and Dun­man Food Cen­tre hawker cen­tres and mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Grass­roots lead­ers and the lo­cal mer­chants’ and hawk­ers’ as­so­ci­a­tions have been en­gag­ing them since Mon­day to in­form them about the tests.</p>
    <p>Some food de­liv­ery work­ers with De­liv­eroo, Food­panda, GrabFood and McDon­ald’s have also pre-reg­is­tered for the test.</p>
    <p>The tests this week­end are not open to any­one aside from these two groups. The re­sults should be ready two to three days af­ter the tests, and only those who test pos­i­tive will be con­tacted by the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Test­ing is a key part of the fight against the coro­n­avirus here.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, MOH said that on av­er­age, over 20,000 swabs have been tested daily since July. These in­clude pooled tests where up to five swabs per test can be done.</p>
    <p>“We con­tinue to make progress in ex­pand­ing our test­ing ca­pac­ity and are on track to per­form­ing 40,000 tests a day, if needed, in the com­ing months,” said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>MOH also told ST on Thurs­day that the use of saliva test­ing to de­tect Covid-19 is un­der­go­ing field tests here as the health au­thor­i­ties as­sess if it can be scaled up for wide­spread use.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said that its pre­lim­i­nary find­ings showed saliva test­ing may be “slightly more com­fort­able for some in­di­vid­u­als”, though mech­a­nisms to scale up test­ing in lab­o­ra­to­ries, in­clud­ing pooled test­ing, are still be­ing devel­oped.</p>
    <p>As of noon yes­ter­day, 11 new coro­n­avirus cases were con­firmed, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,543.</p>
    <p>This is the low­est daily fig­ure in about six months since March 12, when there were nine cases.</p>
    <p>But Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said that de­spite the low num­ber of cases, Sin­ga­pore is “still not out of the woods”, and that this will hap­pen only when the global sit­u­a­tion sta­bilises.</p>
    <p>He added: “Now that we have set­tled the dorms, and com­mu­nity cases re­main low, there is a pos­si­bil­ity that we will reach zero cases.</p>
    <p>“But now the next threat we have is the risk of im­port­ing cases, es­pe­cially with loos­en­ing of bor­der re­stric­tions in the months ahead and more peo­ple trav­el­ling. We need to pre­vent im­ported cases from seep­ing into the com­mu­nity and make sure they are be­ing de­tected and ring-fenced at the bor­ders.”</p>
    <p>There were 11 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day – the low­est daily fig­ure in over six months since March 12, when there were nine cases.</p>
    <p>The sole new case in the com­mu­nity re­ported yes­ter­day is cur­rently un­linked. He is a 30-year-old Sin­ga­porean man who was con­firmed pos­i­tive on Thurs­day, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>There was also one new im­ported case – a work per­mit holder who re­turned from In­dia on Sept 6. She had been placed on stay-home no­tice upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore and was tested while serv­ing her no­tice.</p>
    <p>A Gi­ant out­let at Sun­shine Place in Choa Chu Kang Av­enue 3 and the State Courts were added to the places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were still in­fec­tious, MOH said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes and the times of their vis­its to get those who were also at these places dur­ing the spec­i­fied pe­ri­ods to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on MOH’s web­site.</p>
    <p>The min­istry has said that close con­tacts would have been no­ti­fied al­ready and that there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned if needed.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing nine cases were mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,543. Among these, five were iden­ti­fied as con­tacts of pre­vi­ous cases and had al­ready been quar­an­tined to pre­vent fur­ther trans­mis­sion. They were tested dur­ing their quar­an­tine pe­riod, MOH said.</p>
    <p>The other four cases were de­tected through sur­veil­lance test­ing, such as ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power, Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity, Health Pro­mo­tion Board and Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board said in a joint state­ment yes­ter­day that about 5,700 work­ers who are re­quired to un­dergo ros­tered rou­tine test­ing have yet to do so, and will not be able to re­turn to work un­til then.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from two cases two weeks ago to one in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at fewer than one case per day in the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>With 32 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,056 have fully re­cov­ered from the disease. A to­tal of 38 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, while 407 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. None is in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
