    <p>Swings in the mar­ket caused by the un­cer­tainty and volatil­ity from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic have led to more peo­ple get­ting into the stock mar­ket and start­ing their in­vest­ment jour­ney.</p>
    <p>Bro­kers and ex­perts in the field said there was an in­crease in the num­ber of peo­ple trad­ing and in­vest­ing in the first half of this year, as they sought to take ad­van­tage of a mar­ket cor­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX) noted that since Fe­bru­ary, the monthly num­ber of Cen­tral De­pos­i­tory (CDP) ac­count open­ings has seen an in­crease com­pared with the same month in the pre­vi­ous year, with a par­tic­u­lar spike ob­served in March to June.</p>
    <p>A CDP se­cu­ri­ties ac­count is needed for peo­ple to start trad­ing.</p>
    <p>The SGX also ob­served that from Fe­bru­ary to July, the num­ber of CDP ac­count open­ings was more than 21/ times that in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>This aligns with the height­ened ac­tiv­ity in fi­nan­cial mar­kets dur­ing the pe­riod. In an April re­port, the SGX noted that the Straits Times In­dex’s 30-day volatil­ity in­creased to 51.7 per cent on March 31, the high­est level since De­cem­ber 2008.</p>
    <p>The volatil­ity also drove to­tal se­cu­ri­ties mar­ket turnover value up, caus­ing it to jump by 124 per cent year on year in March to $48.2 bil­lion, the re­port said, while the se­cu­ri­ties daily av­er­age value rose 114 per cent year on year to $2.2 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The mar­ket turnover value of ex­change-traded funds (ETF) in­creased more than eight times year on year to $1.2 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Stan­dard Char­tered Bank Sin­ga­pore said it has seen a 200 per cent growth in trad­ing vol­umes and a 20 per cent in­crease in ac­count ap­pli­ca­tions for the bank’s on­line trad­ing plat­form in the first half of this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Mark Chia, the bank’s head of man­aged in­vest­ments and eq­ui­ties, said: “The Covid-19 pan­demic has trig­gered a liq­uid­ity-driven mar­ket rally amidst un­prece­dented fis­cal and mone­tary pol­icy stim­u­lus. In­vestors are also be­com­ing more fi­nan­cially savvy. They are fa­mil­iar with in­vest­ment con­cepts such as ‘buy­ing on dips’ and ‘dol­lar-cost av­er­ag­ing’.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese in­vestors view the cur­rent volatile eq­uity mar­kets as an in­vest­ment op­por­tu­nity. More flex­i­ble work sched­ules and be­ing able to con­ve­niently ac­cess eq­uity mar­kets dig­i­tally are also con­tribut­ing fac­tors.”</p>
    <p>DBS Bank said that over the past few years, it has al­ready ob­served an in­creas­ing num­ber of cus­tomers want­ing to in­vest their money and to trade, es­pe­cially among those aged 45 years and be­low.</p>
    <p>“This was pro­nounced in the first quar­ter of this year, when the mar­ket ex­pe­ri­enced a cor­rec­tion, where we wit­nessed a surge in in­vest­ment de­mand like many oth­ers in the in­dus­try,” said Ms</p>
    <p>Evy Wee, the bank’s head of fi­nan­cial plan­ning and per­sonal in­vest­ing. “To­tal new-to-trad­ing DBS ac­counts opened in the first half of the year more than dou­bled that of full-year 2019.”</p>
    <p>She added that the bank also saw record lev­els of self-di­rected in­vest­ing ac­tiv­i­ties around eq­ui­ties and for­eign ex­change trad­ing, in­vest­ment of funds, DBS In­vestSaver plans and the bank’s dig­i­tal port­fo­lio.</p>
    <p>“This means more cus­tomers have come for­ward to set up reg­u­lar in­vest­ing plans, while some of our ex­ist­ing cus­tomers have gone on to in­crease their monthly in­vest­ment amounts,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Sim­i­larly, some of our re­tail and wealth cus­tomers who are in­vested in DBS digiPort­fo­lio have also topped up their in­vest­ment port­fo­lios. Oth­ers have cho­sen to pur­chase funds or unit trusts as a start to their in­vest­ment jour­neys.”</p>
    <p>OCBC Se­cu­ri­ties ob­served that the av­er­age monthly num­ber of new ac­counts has more than dou­bled com­pared with the pe­riod be­fore the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>Trad­ing vol­ume also jumped close to 80 per cent when com­par­ing the first half of this year with the sec­ond half of last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Sa­muel Wong, OCBC Se­cu­ri­ties trad­ing strate­gist, noted: “With more than 30 per cent cor­rec­tion in most ma­jor global mar­kets po­ten­tially hap­pen­ing within a short time­frame, in­vestors and traders may be em­bold­ened to en­gage in more in­vest­ments.”</p>
    <p>Mr David Ger­ald, pres­i­dent of the Se­cu­ri­ties In­vestors As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore), said he noted that there has been grow­ing re­tail par­tic­i­pa­tion in the lo­cal stock mar­ket and more re­tail in­vestors open­ing ac­counts es­pe­cially af­ter a fall in prices in March.</p>
    <p>“This in­crease in re­tail par­tic­i­pa­tion is not just con­fined to lo­cal bro­kers. We note more re­tail par­tic­i­pa­tion in for­eign ex­change trad­ing and also trad­ing in other mar­kets like the United States.”</p>
    <p>But first-timers should be care­ful es­pe­cially dur­ing this time, he said. “In­vestors are ad­vised to fa­mil­iarise them­selves thor­oughly with all the risks and fea­tures of the in­vest­ments they are con­sid­er­ing with an ex­pe­ri­enced fi­nan­cial ad­viser be­fore tak­ing the plunge.</p>
    <p>“Re­tail in­vestors who have en­tered or re-en­tered the mar­ket over the past few months with hopes of mak­ing a quick buck could very eas­ily have found them­selves caught on the wrong end of a trade.”</p>
    <p>GROW­ING MORE SAVVY</p>
    <p>In­vestors are also be­com­ing more fi­nan­cially savvy. They are fa­mil­iar with in­vest­ment con­cepts such as ‘buy­ing on dips’ and ‘dol­lar-cost av­er­ag­ing’. Th­ese in­vestors view the cur­rent volatile eq­uity mar­kets as an in­vest­ment op­por­tu­nity.</p>
