    <p>There is no limit to the size of our dreams and no known fron­tier to hu­man am­bi­tion. For some this is a bumper sticker and for oth­ers a prayer to live by. This year a 72-year-old car­pen­ter rowed across the At­lantic in a boat built in his gar­den. Two years ago, Xia Boyu, then 69, sum­mited Ever­est, the same moun­tain which claimed his feet through frost­bite in 1975.</p>
    <p>There are those who wish to travel to Lour­des and those who take their faith to dif­fer­ent shrines. Xia kept re­turn­ing to Ever­est, as if the moun­tain beck­oned him. It rep­re­sented a “per­sonal chal­lenge” and it is a beau­ti­fully elas­tic phrase. Among run­ners, for in­stance, your per­sonal chal­lenge may be to run to the next bus stop or to one day fin­ish a marathon.</p>
    <p>Very nice, ex­cept that Veronique Bourbeau wants to run across a con­ti­nent. All 13,000km of Africa. It sounds mag­nif­i­cent and un­rea­son­able all at once, but the essence of ad­ven­ture is al­ways au­dac­ity.</p>
    <p>Ex­plor­ers of ev­ery type are in­trigu­ing for they are alive with gi­gan­tic ideas. Some­times you want to place a mi­cro­phone in­side their brains to lis­ten to the voices they hear. Run across a con­ti­nent? The lu­nacy of it is ir­re­sistible but this is how or­di­nary peo­ple find the ex­tra­or­di­nary within them.</p>
    <p>Bourbeau, a peak per­for­mance coach from Canada who lives in Sin­ga­pore, has a stock ex­pres­sion, which is that she finds “the best ver­sion of her­self” while run­ning. So, then, why stop? Roads never end any­way, only we do.</p>
    <p>In 2016, she ran 3,010km across Ja­pan in 72 days with her daugh­ter cy­cling be­side her with a baby car­riage full of equip­ment. In 2019, she trot­ted to first place in a 444km race across Malaysia in 98 hours and 27 min­utes. To lis­ten to her is to ad­mire her am­bi­tion while con­sid­er­ing your own lim­its.</p>
    <p>How far can we go? Why should we go? En­light­en­ment? Sat­is­fac­tion? Well, if noth­ing else you will see, as she has, a dead croc­o­dile by the road in Malaysia and sleep as a guest in a po­lice sta­tion in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>The most pro­found con­tests in­volve an ex­plo­ration of the self. When hu­mans cross deserts they wres­tle with an arid land and their re­solve. In 1977, Robyn David­son walked 2,700km across the Aus­tralian desert with four camels and wrote: “The two im­por­tant things that I did learn were that you are as pow­er­ful and strong as you al­low your­self to be, and that the most dif­fi­cult part of any en­deav­our is tak­ing the first step.”</p>
    <p>No crowd fol­lows the ul­tra­ma­rathoner, no trek ends with wild ap­plause. Yet a ful­fil­ment comes. This month, climber Emily Har­ring­ton posted a pic­ture of her­self on In­sta­gram which was a study in bloody pain. She was try­ing to be­come the first woman to free climb a par­tic­u­lar route of the 914m gran­ite face of El Cap­i­tan in Yosemite Na­tional Park when she slipped.</p>
    <p>She was roped but hit her head hard and bled pro­fusely. “There was a part of me that wanted to give up and quit,” she said. “But this other part of me was like, this is why you’re here. It’s sup­posed to be hard. You owe it to your­self to try again.” She fin­ished in 21hr 13min.</p>
    <p>If Har­ring­ton is a pro climber, then it is the ev­ery­day-ness of Bourbeau – who is searching for spon­sors – which is strik­ing: Busi­ness­woman, 47, mother of two. She might be the woman next to you in the su­per­mar­ket, some­one re­lat­able, some­one you could be. Well, if you learn to wear suf­fer­ing.</p>
    <p>“I’m not a superhero,” Bourbeau says. “I started on a tread­mill.” At 34, she ran for two min­utes and then walked for one. Six months later she ran a marathon. Her nick­name as a girl was Blue Whale and if it was a snide ref­er­ence to her size, then now she should take it as a com­pli­ment: Those epic crea­tures make 6,400km mi­gra­tions ev­ery year and per­haps it is jour­neys which con­nect them.</p>
    <p>In a Covid world noth­ing is as­sured, cer­tainly not a run through a con­ti­nent, but plans must be made. An­cient ex­pe­di­tions ran out of food and ex­plor­ers per­ished and so care­ful lists are be­ing made in the Bourbeau house, which in­clude snake anti-venom, por­ta­ble mini-show­ers and a mega­phone. Shoes will be changed al­most ev­ery three weeks, for run­ning might be a spir­i­tual act but it in­volves worn-out soles.</p>
    <p>David Liv­ing­stone tra­versed Africa from west to east in the 1800s, but Bourbeau will roam north to south, a 165cm woman wan­der­ing through the vil­lages of run­ning gi­ants. Her con­quest is of her­self and yet it is a tidy co­in­ci­dence that she hopes to start in Alexan­dria, Egypt, a city founded by a king who kept march­ing.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple roam in the name of science, to save the en­vi­ron­ment, to set a record, to find a river’s source. Noth­ing im­pels ad­ven­tur­ers more than an idea big­ger than them­selves. Bourbeau, who lived in Sene­gal, will run – among other things – to raise funds for, and aware­ness about, drink­ing wa­ter in Africa. A sin­gle per­son may not change the world but can at least try and make a dent in in­equal­ity.</p>
    <p>Bourbeau is a rest­less spirit and so her feet will al­ways find an open road. But what about us? Once, as chil­dren, we were in­stinc­tive ex­plor­ers, alive with cu­rios­ity, but per­haps we have for­got­ten the words Dr Seuss wrote in his book, Oh, the Places You’ll Go!:</p>
    <p>“You’re off to great places</p>
    <p>To­day is your day!</p>
    <p>Your moun­tain is wait­ing.</p>
    <p>So... get on your way!”</p>
    <p>Good idea, we think. Then too many of us reach for an­other beer.</p>
    <p>An­cient ex­pe­di­tions ran out of food and ex­plor­ers per­ished and so care­ful lists are be­ing made in the Bourbeau house, which in­clude snake anti-venom, por­ta­ble mini-show­ers and a mega­phone. Shoes will be changed al­most ev­ery three weeks, for run­ning might be a spir­i­tual act but it in­volves worn-out soles.</p>
