    <p>Ev­ery once in a while, it’s nice to have a re­minder of why I do what I do. The monotony of the reg­i­men and rigours of the pro­gramme can some­times drive me into a ro­botic cy­cle of eat, sleep and swim on re­peat, to the point where I some­times for­get my pur­pose.</p>
    <p>Be­ing here i n Hun­gary, sur­rounded by some of the best in the world, my sense of self is strength­ened.</p>
    <p>The cir­cuit breaker at home put many things on hold, and for a pe­riod of time, at least with re­gard to swim­ming, it felt as if ev­ery­thing was at a stand­still. Ever since I got here, I feel like I fi­nally let go of this re­ally deep breath that I’ve been hold­ing for a long time.</p>
    <p>It has been only three weeks, but I have al­ready had in­ter­ac­tions with oth­ers that have helped me fur­ther my un­der­stand­ing of my­self as an in­di­vid­ual and as an ath­lete. I had din­ner one night with Alia Atkin­son (one me­tre apart), short-course world cham­pion from Ja­maica. I re­called a con­ver­sa­tion we had at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, about where our swim­ming ca­reers were go­ing and how we might both re­tire shortly af­ter the Games.</p>
    <p>Talk­ing to her that night, it struck me that here we are, four years later, both still swim­ming com­pet­i­tively. Watch­ing her smile and talk about swim­ming and the joy she found in rac­ing, you would never have guessed how she had con­sid­ered leav­ing the sport for­ever at one point.</p>
    <p>It made me re­alise that you shouldn’t put a fixed end date to some­thing you love. The pas­sion will al­ways draw you back in, and it’s hard to let go un­til you know</p>
    <p>deep down that it’s time.</p>
    <p>Leah Gin­grich, who rep­re­sents DC Tri­dent with me, re­tired six years ago af­ter swim­ming for the Univer­sity of Texas. She re­turned to the pool only last year and is now gun­ning for the Tokyo Games. Lis­ten­ing to two vet­er­ans and how they still love the sport, it gave me a lot more con­fi­dence in my de­ci­sion to stay in the sport.</p>
    <p>I also re­ally en­joy talk­ing to Breeja Lar­son, Olympic gold medal­list for the USA. Her pas­sion is ev­i­dent in the ex­tent of her knowl­edge on men­tal and phys­i­cal prac­tices, and her ex­cite­ment is in­fec­tious. She told me about her the­ory that some of the best ath­letes in the world do so well be­cause they com­pete for more than just them­selves.</p>
    <p>CON­DUCIVE AT­MOS­PHERE</p>
    <p>Look­ing back, some of my best races were done when I was sur­rounded by peo­ple that I loved and wanted to swim well for, and be­ing in this en­vi­ron­ment re­ally mo­ti­vates me to want to be bet­ter for the peo­ple I care about. I wake up want­ing to be great.</p>
    <p>I have also learnt that it is pos­si­ble to lead a full life along with com­pet­i­tive swim­ming and not feel like the sport is hin­der­ing my progress in other ar­eas of my life. I lis­ten to swim­mers talk about their pas­sion projects and jobs, how they make rais­ing fam­i­lies work, and the classes they take on the side.</p>
    <p>There is life out­side of the pool,</p>
    <p>but I do not have to wait to stop swim­ming be­fore I can ex­pe­ri­ence all that, and that ex­cites me.</p>
    <p>On this is­land, it is a hot­pot of na­tion­al­i­ties and cul­tures. There are swim­mers from all over the world. One of the things that reigns con­stant is pas­sion. Pas­sion and a de­sire for great­ness. For not want­ing to set­tle. For not want­ing to be com­fort­able. Pas­sion helps peo­ple get through dif­fi­cult times.</p>
    <p>Lis­ten­ing to swim­mers swop Covid-19 lock­down sto­ries and how they had to mod­ify their train­ing pro­grammes, it re­minded me if you want some­thing badly enough, you would find ways to get it.</p>
    <p>DC team­mate Lin­nea Mack and her club (Team Elite) would use her coach’s back­yard to do land work­outs, and used what­ever they could lift, pull, and push to train. Mo­hamed Samy talked about how he picked up box­ing and what it taught him about power and how he trans­lated what he learnt on land in the wa­ter af­ter the pools in Egypt opened back up.</p>
    <p>If there is a will, there is a way.</p>
    <p>CHANG­ING MIND­SET</p>
    <p>Amid the ex­cite­ment and chat­ter, one mo­ment that made me go quiet in­side was when Bob Platt, a coach for DC Tri­dent, asked me if I be­lieve that I saw my­self mak­ing the semi-fi­nals at the Tokyo Olympics next year. He has been tak­ing me for many of my swim prac­tices here, and we often talk about stroke and tech­nique. I spent the next 10 min­utes warm­ing down and think­ing about his ques­tion.</p>
    <p>Af­ter­wards, we had a very can­did con­ver­sa­tion. I told him that vi­sion was fuzzy. I like day­dream­ing and think­ing of all kinds of sce­nar­ios, but re­cently I haven’t re­ally al­lowed my­self to think that far ahead and dream that big. If there is some­thing that 2020 has shown, it is that mak­ing big plans can some­times lead to big dis­ap­point­ment.</p>
    <p>As I talked to him on the bus, I came to a shame­ful re­al­i­sa­tion. Too often I get in my own way and don’t give my­self a chance to see how good I could be.</p>
    <p>Up till last year, I had spent most</p>
    <p>of my time in the pool con­tent on just be­ing good, but never try­ing to be great. Last year was one of the first times in a long time when I took own­er­ship of my swim­ming and gave my­self that op­por­tu­nity to try.</p>
    <p>So I fig­ured, why not keep the mo­men­tum go­ing and try to ride that wave and keep the up­ward tra­jec­tory go­ing?</p>
    <p>The con­ver­sa­tion with coach Bob was a dif­fi­cult one to have. But af­ter­wards, I felt em­pow­ered. Em­bold­ened. My vi­sion mov­ing for­ward to­wards Tokyo be­came clearer. But it didn’t just stop at the Olympics.</p>
    <p>That con­ver­sa­tion made me re­think what I want af­ter the Games. It made me won­der how I can make this life­style sus­tain­able, so that I can keep push­ing my­self to my fullest po­ten­tial for as long as I can and want to.</p>
    <p>I have not felt this com­fort­able as a swim­mer in a long time. I am sur­rounded by peo­ple like me. I am less in­se­cure about my swim­mer shoul­ders, the quan­tity of food I eat, the amount of talk­ing about swim­ming and how much I work out. No one here calls me crazy for wak­ing up at 5am to jump into the freez­ing wa­ter, no one com­plains about the smell of chlo­rine, no one ques­tions the grind.</p>
    <p>All of us un­der­stand the hus­tle. We speak the same lingo. We get one an­other. We get it. I feel so at home.</p>
    <p>Too often I get in my own way and don’t give my­self a chance to see how good I could be. Up till last year, I had spent most of my time in the pool con­tent on just be­ing good, but never try­ing to be great. 2019 was one of the first times in a long time when I took own­er­ship of my swim­ming and gave my­self that op­por­tu­nity to try.</p>
