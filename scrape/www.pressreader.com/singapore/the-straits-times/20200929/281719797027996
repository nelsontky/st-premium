    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has un­der­scored the im­por­tance of public com­mu­ni­ca­tion, as well as the need for in­sti­tu­tions such as the me­dia to build up trust with their au­di­ences, said pan­el­lists dur­ing a dis­cus­sion on World News Day yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Public com­mu­ni­ca­tion is of­ten over­looked as a pil­lar of re­sponse to out­breaks, and hav­ing cred­i­ble news or­gan­i­sa­tions is crit­i­cal to this, said the panel.</p>
    <p>The three pan­el­lists were Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, group chief of medicine at the Na­tional Univer­sity Health Sys­tem; Dr June Tay, head of the dig­i­tal me­dia pro­gramme at the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences (SUSS); and The Straits Times edi­tor Warren Fernandez.</p>
    <p>The ses­sion, ti­tled Tack­ling Covid-19: Get­ting It Right And How You Can Con­trib­ute, was held at The Straits Times’ news­room and streamed vir­tu­ally. The ses­sion was mod­er­ated by chief ex­ec­u­tive of Strate­gic Moves and for­mer Nom­i­nated MP Viswa Sada­si­van.</p>
    <p>Prof Fisher, an in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert, said a lack of good risk com­mu­ni­ca­tion and com­mu­nity en­gage­ment could lead to peo­ple fail­ing to do their part to curb the spread of disease.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple al­ways think of case man­age­ment, in­fec­tion preven­tion and con­trol, test­ing, epi­demi­ol­ogy and the epi­demic curves that we have to flat­ten... but the fi­nal pil­lar is al­ways risk com­mu­ni­ca­tions, com­mu­nity en­gage­ment.</p>
    <p>“And if you get that wrong, this leads to a failed re­sponse,” said Prof Fisher, who chairs the Global Out­break Alert and Re­sponse Net­work steer­ing com­mit­tee for the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Fernandez said that World News Day was an op­por­tu­nity to make the case that hav­ing cred­i­ble me­dia or­gan­i­sa­tions is im­por­tant to the process of public com­mu­ni­ca­tion, and the health and well-be­ing of so­ci­eties.</p>
    <p>“You need good public in­for­ma­tion go­ing out, you need the ex­perts. But to com­plete that cir­cle, you need good, cred­i­ble jour­nal­ism as well,” said Mr Fernandez, who is also pres­i­dent of the World Edi­tors Fo­rum and edi­tor-in-chief of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’ English/ Malay/Tamil Me­dia Group.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing this Covid-19 pe­riod, there has been a surge in the num­ber of peo­ple ac­cess­ing news from sources like ST, he said. This hunger for in­for­ma­tion speaks to the is­sue of trust and cred­i­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>What the news­room has done is to in­vest in cor­re­spon­dents, build­ing up their au­thor­i­ta­tive­ness and cred­i­bil­ity over the years so that they can step up when such a cri­sis breaks out, he said.</p>
    <p>He said a de­ci­sion was made by ST to put all con­tent re­lated to Covid-19 out­side of the pay­wall as a public ser­vice.</p>
    <p>“We did that with some trep­i­da­tion as it has com­mer­cial im­pli­ca­tions, but what we found was our sub­scrip­tions ac­tu­ally went up, and that says to me that peo­ple do value the in­for­ma­tion,” he added.</p>
    <p>Dr Tay, from SUSS’ School of Sci­ence and Tech­nol­ogy, said that Covid-19 has brought not just risks and chal­lenges, but also op­por­tu­ni­ties in the dig­i­tal space.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to a ques­tion from the au­di­ence about how peo­ple can adapt as cer­tain jobs are wiped out with the ad­vent of the dig­i­tal econ­omy, Dr Tay said it was im­por­tant to har­ness cre­ativ­ity and the “hu­man touch” to cre­ate more com­pelling prod­ucts and ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“If you see some durian sell­ers who do live stream­ing, it’s ac­tu­ally very ex­cit­ing. They are able to en­gage the au­di­ence and show their per­son­al­ity. So, we re­ally have to think about how we do things in dif­fer­ent ways,” she said.</p>
