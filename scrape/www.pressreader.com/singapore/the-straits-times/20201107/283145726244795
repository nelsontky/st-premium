    <p>What is elec­tronic brake force dis­tri­bu­tion? Is it dif­fer­ent from anti-lock brak­ing sys­tem? If not, what is its func­tion?</p>
    <p>If the weight of a car is equally dis­trib­uted over its four cor­ners, then the brak­ing force to bring the ve­hi­cle to a stop would be ex­actly one-quar­ter of the to­tal force.</p>
    <p>But even in a car with 50:50 weight bal­ance front-to-rear, ideal con­di­tions never ex­ist on the road. Sur­face un­du­la­tions, roll an­gles due to cor­ner­ing speeds, pas­sen­ger and lug­gage loads – they all cause changes in weight on each tyre. At the same time, when the driver ap­plies the brakes, there is a weight trans­fer to­wards the front that sig­nif­i­cantly al­ters the load act­ing on each tyre.</p>
    <p>In any ve­hi­cle, whether front-wheel, rear-wheel or all-wheel driven, it is al­ways the front that pro­vides more than 70 per cent of brak­ing power. That is why front discs are al­ways larger than the rear ones. This does not hap­pen nat­u­rally and is in fact the re­sult of brake force dis­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>The early brake force dis­tri­bu­tion sys­tems were man­aged by sim­ple me­chan­i­cal pro­por­tion­ing valves based on ride height. As the ve­hi­cle load in­creased due to lug­gage or pas­sen­gers, the change in ride height moved a lever con­nected to the valve. This reg­u­lated brake pres­sure, but only be­tween front and rear axles.</p>
    <p>Elec­tronic brake force dis­tri­bu­tion (EBD) be­came pos­si­ble with the ad­vent of anti-lock brak­ing sys­tem (ABS) and high-speed elec­tronic con­trols.</p>
    <p>The ABS mod­u­lates brak­ing to pre­vent skid­ding from wheel lock-up. EBD uses ABS sen­sors and feed­back from the car’s elec­tronic sta­bil­ity sys­tem to dis­trib­ute the op­ti­mum brake pres­sure to wheel or wheels where the max­i­mum weight is trans­ferred to. Hence, a lightly laden pair of rear tyres, for ex­am­ple, would have the least brake pres­sure chan­nelled to them.</p>
