    <p>MI­AMI • Char­lie Woods wowed his 15-time Ma­jor cham­pion fa­ther Tiger with an im­pres­sive ea­gle for Team Woods in the PNC Cham­pi­onship fam­ily tour­na­ment in Or­lando, Florida, on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The 11-year-old put his drive in the fair­way at the par-five third hole of the Ritz-Carl­ton Golf Club, then hooked a five-wood ap­proach around some trees.</p>
    <p>The ball bounced short of the green and set­tled three feet from the pin, with Char­lie giv­ing a fist­pump just like his old man be­fore rolling in the putt.</p>
    <p>A beam­ing Woods had a hug for his son, ex­claim­ing “First ea­gle!” as they walked off the green.</p>
    <p>Char­lie, whose swing is so rem­i­nis­cent of his su­per­star dad, has drawn plenty of com­ments this week­end, drain­ing an­other birdie putt in the first-round scram­ble for­mat, fol­low­ing the ball as it rolled to­wards the cup and in at the ninth. At the 13th, he struck a sweet tee shot and sig­nalled to Tiger – play­ing off the tour­na­ment tees fur­ther back – that he did not even need to hit a tee ball.</p>
    <p>“It was some of the most in­cred­i­ble golf shots,” the for­mer world No. 1 said with a laugh. “He had the best time to be out there in this en­vi­ron­ment. I’ve seen this all along. A lot of the shots he hit, I’ve seen this en­tire year.</p>
    <p>“We had so much fun be­ing around one an­other and cheer­ing one an­other on. It was the most per­fect en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>“First and fore­most, I’m dad. There is that com­pet­i­tive spirit that Char­lie and I both share. We want to win, but be­ing com­pet­i­tive and be­ing with each other and lean­ing on one an­other, it was an ab­so­lute blast.”</p>
    <p>The Woods duo got off to a hot start at their first of­fi­cial tour­na­ment to­gether, with six birdies and an ea­gle on the front nine.</p>
    <p>They com­bined for a 10-un­der 62 that left them shar­ing sixth, four shots be­hind reign­ing Sin­ga­pore Open cham­pion Matt Kuchar</p>
    <p>PART OF THEIR DNA</p>
    <p>and son Cameron.</p>
    <p>Vi­jay Singh and son Qass were in sec­ond, two shots adrift, with Aus­tralian Greg Nor­man and son Greg Jr an­other shot back and tied with Tom and Sean Lehman, and David and Brady Du­val. LPGA great An­nika Soren­stam and her dad Tom were joint-14th at seven un­der.</p>
    <p>The two-day ex­hi­bi­tion tour­na­ment fea­tures 20 teams of Ma­jor cham­pi­ons paired with a fam­ily mem­ber. Char­lie is the youngest com­peti­tor to take part, and Tiger has stressed all week that the main aim was to have fun with his son.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally don’t care about my game. I’m just mak­ing sure that Char­lie has the time of his life and he’s do­ing that,” he said. “I’m mak­ing sure he is able to en­joy all of this.”</p>
    <p>The duo played along­side world No. 3 Justin Thomas and his fa­ther, Mike. The 2017 PGA Cham­pi­onship win­ner re­vealed the young Woods was al­ready an ac­com­plished trash-talker, hav­ing trolled Team Thomas with a note when they were in a bunker.</p>
    <p>“It started in the pro-am. Char­lie drove one through the fair­way and my dad was play­ing in front of them and he’d hit it through the fair­way and into the trees,” he said.</p>
    <p>“My dad wrote on a piece of pa­per, ‘draw hole’ on it and put it un­der his ball. In typ­i­cal Woods fash­ion, he kept the piece of pa­per, and when my dad hit it in the bunker he put the ex­act same piece of pa­per be­hind his ball.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mike ad­mit­ted Char­lie’s cheek­i­ness is backed up by his bur­geon­ing tal­ent on the greens. “I knew what he had,” he said. “He was im­pres­sive. Very im­pres­sive.”</p>
    <p>It was the most per­fect en­vi­ron­ment. First and fore­most, I’m dad. There is that com­pet­i­tive spirit that Char­lie and I both share. We want to win.</p>
