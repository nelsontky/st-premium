    <p>While there was no con­sen­sus dur­ing this week’s Par­lia­ment sit­ting on is­sues such as min­i­mum wage lev­els and new ap­proaches to dis­cussing race-re­lated poli­cies, one thing that both sides of the po­lit­i­cal fence could agree on was this: Sin­ga­pore must re­main open for busi­ness, but more ef­fort must be made to shore up the Sin­ga­porean core in the work­force. Pub­lic sen­ti­ment on this is­sue, if not care­fully man­aged, could eas­ily turn na­tivist and xeno­pho­bic. Al­ready, many coun­tries are re­assess­ing the ben­e­fits of wel­com­ing for­eign tal­ent and are turn­ing in­wards amid do­mes­tic pres­sure to pro­tect busi­nesses and work­ers.</p>
    <p>Closer to home, free trade pacts like the Sin­ga­pore-In­dia Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion Agree­ment had be­come a light­ning rod for crit­ics, who say it opened the flood­gates here for In­dian na­tion­als. But a city-state with­out a nat­u­ral hin­ter­land must cre­ate for it­self a man-made com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tage. This is where the net­work ef­fect of free trade pacts comes in. The more pacts Sin­ga­pore has, the more it can at­tract in­vestors who wish to tap them to ex­pand into re­gional mar­kets, and the more jobs it can cre­ate. In­stead of clos­ing it­self off to for­eign­ers, a more sus­tain­able strat­egy is to boost Sin­ga­pore­ans’ skills and en­sure they have a level play­ing field in the job mar­ket, both in the let­ter and spirit of the law.</p>
    <p>MPs also urged a more fun­da­men­tal re­view of pol­icy ap­proaches, in­clud­ing fur­ther rais­ing the min­i­mum pay for Em­ploy­ment Pass hold­ers in sec­tors like in­fo­comm tech­nol­ogy and pro­fes­sional ser­vices, which tend to have more firms on the Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work watch-list for po­ten­tially dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices. Other mea­sures pro­posed in­cluded im­pos­ing man­power quo­tas; manda­tory au­dits on re­cal­ci­trant firms; re­mov­ing pref­er­en­tial tax rates or not award­ing them pub­lic sec­tor con­tracts; and tier­ing eco­nomic in­cen­tives based on their com­mit­ment to trans­fer skills to Sin­ga­pore­ans. There were also calls to re­con­sider the long-held no­tion that fair em­ploy­ment leg­is­la­tion is not in­vest­ment-friendly, given that it has not stopped the likes of Lon­don and New York from be­ing vi­brant fi­nan­cial cen­tres.</p>
    <p>The is­sue is an emo­tive one for many Sin­ga­pore­ans, and there are no easy solutions. Choke off for­eign man­power al­to­gether, and one risks throt­tling com­pa­nies and spook­ing in­vestors. Yet if the labour is­sue is left to mar­ket forces, more com­pa­nies could game the sys­tem. There will need to be co­or­di­nated Gov­ern­ment in­ter­ven­tion. Tight­en­ing Em­ploy­ment Pass and S-Pass rules alone is not enough. There must also be pos­i­tive steps such as sub­sidised trainee­ships and train­ing al­lowances to in­cen­tivise firms to hire more lo­cals. Ul­ti­mately though, there can be no pride in be­ing a big fish in an ever-shrink­ing pond. Sin­ga­pore­ans must not give up on the longer-term fight to stay com­pet­i­tive on the global stage.</p>
