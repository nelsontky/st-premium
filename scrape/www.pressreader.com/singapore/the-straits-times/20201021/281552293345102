    <p>Sport Sin­ga­pore is aim­ing to ap­point at least one trained safe­guard­ing of­fi­cer in ev­ery na­tional sports as­so­ci­a­tion (NSA) by the end of this year, and dou­ble this num­ber by the end of next year, in an ef­fort to pro­tect ath­letes from abuse and ha­rass­ment. Nearly 100 safe­guard­ing of­fi­cers have been trained and of the 64 NSAs, fewer than 10 have yet to ap­point a safe­guard­ing of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>With the topic of ath­lete abuse mak­ing head­lines re­cently, Sport Sin­ga­pore (SportSG) is in­creas­ing ef­forts to pro­tect them from such mis­con­duct and ha­rass­ment.</p>
    <p>The na­tional agency is aim­ing to have at least one trained safe­guard­ing of­fi­cer in each na­tional sports as­so­ci­a­tion (NSA) by the end of this year, and dou­ble this num­ber by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>The Safe Sport Com­mis­sion was launched last year to look into pre­ven­tive mea­sures to safe­guard ath­letes, coaches and other par­tic­i­pants. Nearly 100 safe­guard­ing of­fi­cers have been trained and of the 64 NSAs, fewer than 10 have yet to ap­point a safe­guard­ing of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Eric Chua also ad­dressed the need for coaches to adapt to the evolv­ing land­scape of sports in yes­ter­day’s open­ing day of the CoachSG vir­tual con­fer­ence or­gan­ised by SportSG.</p>
    <p>To help coaches with this, a SportSG-Ed­u­ca­tion and Devel­op­ment (SportSG-ED) por­tal de­vel­oped by the agency and Repub­lic Poly­tech­nic will be launched by the end of the year, he said.</p>
    <p>Through the por­tal, coaches can learn about sports sci­ence and new dig­i­tal skills as well as ac­cess con­tent from renowned coach­ing con­sul­tants and ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Mr Chua added: “As coaches, you need to be able to make sense of the evolv­ing land­scape of sports, learn from global best prac­tices in coach­ing, and trans­late this into lessons that will shape the char­ac­ter, val­ues and at­ti­tudes of those un­der your care.”</p>
    <p>The re­lease of Net­flix doc­u­men­tary Ath­lete A in June on for­mer USA Gym­nas­tics doc­tor Larry Nas­sar’s sex­ual as­sault of young ath­letes prompted many to come for­ward to share their own ex­pe­ri­ences of men­tal and phys­i­cal ill treat­ment.</p>
    <p>Among them were for­mer Sin­ga­porean fig­ure skater Yu Shu­ran and ex-na­tional gym­nast Eileen Chai, who spoke out about their har­row­ing ex­pe­ri­ences while train­ing in China.</p>
    <p>Mr Chua high­lighted Sin­ga­pore Swim­ming As­so­ci­a­tion ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor Ed­win Ker’s ex­pe­ri­ence as one of three safe­guard­ing of­fi­cers at the as­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“As part of his train­ing pro­gramme, Ed­win was taught how to iden­tify the signs, prac­tise re­spond­ing to com­plaints of abuse, and gained in­sights into how to han­dle both par­ents and chil­dren,” he said.</p>
    <p>The train­ing has height­ened Ker’s aware­ness of the ad­di­tional pre­cau­tions re­quired in en­sur­ing safe sport, and “how to com­mu­ni­cate with his own chil­dren should they be un­able to com­mu­ni­cate clearly”, added Mr Chua.</p>
    <p>Ker, who has three chil­dren aged three to seven, said he feels as­sured and grate­ful the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties are tak­ing the ini­tia­tive to dis­cuss safe sport and help NSAs en­hance their stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dure (SOP) in this area.</p>
    <p>He told The Straits Times: “By ed­u­cat­ing the sport­ing fra­ter­nity... and driv­ing a stronger aware­ness on the red flag be­hav­iours, more stake­hold­ers are aware and in­formed about the dos and don’ts, as well as the pro­cesses to re­port cases and in­ci­dences where nec­es­sary.”</p>
    <p>Na­tional net­ball cap­tain Charmaine Soh, 30, said that with proper SOPs in place, ath­letes can fo­cus on play­ing sport in­stead of wor­ry­ing about ex­ter­nal fac­tors.</p>
    <p>“If safe­guard­ing of­fi­cers know how to re­spond, I would feel en­cour­aged be­cause I know that things will be han­dled well and more ath­letes would come for­ward if they are as­sured that the safe­guard­ing of­fi­cers can do their jobs well,” she added.</p>
    <p>Be­sides train­ing more safe­guard­ing of­fi­cers, SportSG will also launch on­line mod­ules on safe sport as a part of its coach ed­u­ca­tion cour­ses by the end of this year.</p>
    <p>The CoachSG con­fer­ence runs un­til to­mor­row. Other speak­ers in­clude for­mer swim­mer and mixed mar­tial arts fighter May Ooi and for­mer na­tional sprinter C. Ku­nalan.</p>
    <p>I would feel en­cour­aged be­cause I know that things will be han­dled well and more ath­letes would come for­ward if they are as­sured that the safe­guard­ing of­fi­cers can do their jobs well.</p>
