While manual drivers may enjoy having control of the gear shifts, it is important to operate the manual transmissi­on properly.
Avoid pressing on the clutch unnecessar­ily or not completely before you change gears. Shifting gears correctly can help you prevent premature wear and tear of your transmissi­on system.
