    <p>TREAT OR TRICK: While Hal­loween fes­tiv­i­ties had been cut back due to Covid-19, some celebri­ties in Asia still took the chance last Satur­day to dress up with their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal ac­tress Yvonne Lim, 44, and her fam­ily (above, left) dressed up as char­ac­ters from Alice In Won­der­land on Satur­day. Lim wrote in Chi­nese she had at first wanted to “take a break” this year, but did not want to dis­ap­point her kids.</p>
    <p>She and her hus­band Alex Tien, 41, a busi­ness­man, have a five-year-old son and three-year-old daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>Tai­wanese singer Jay Chou also co­or­di­nated his Hal­loween out­fit with the rest of his fam­ily (above, right) as char­ac­ters from The Ad­dams Fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Chou, 41, looked to be Gomez. His wife Han­nah Quin­li­van, 27, seemed like Mor­ti­cia, while their daugh­ter Hath­away, five, was Wed­nes­day and son Romeo, three, was Pugs­ley.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, lo­cal singers Tay Kewei and Al­fred Sim (right) looked to the East for in­spi­ra­tion when it came to their Hal­loween cos­tumes.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple and their two kids dressed up as char­ac­ters from Chi­nese clas­sic novel, Jour­ney To The West. Sim, 38, gamely donned the cos­tume of Pigsy (Zhu Ba­jie), while Tay, 36, looked to be Sandy (Sha Wu­jing).</p>
    <p>Their three-year-old son was a brood­ing Mon­key God (Sun Wukong) while their se­cond son, who is four months old, donned the or­ange and yel­low robes of monk Trip­i­taka or Tang San­zang.</p>
