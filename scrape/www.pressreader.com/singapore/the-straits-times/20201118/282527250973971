    <p>Peo­ple with hy­per­ten­sion should take the medicines pre­scribed and adopt a healthy life­style to keep the con­di­tion in check.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Tan Huay Cheem, chair­man of the Sin­ga­pore Heart Foun­da­tion, of­fers some tips:</p>
    <p>CHOOSE A BAL­ANCED DIET</p>
    <p>Main­tain­ing a healthy weight is im­por­tant in keep­ing blood pres­sure un­der con­trol. In­creased body weight raises blood pres­sure and pos­si­bly the need for higher doses and more drugs to con­trol the pres­sure.</p>
    <p>Choose a healthy and bal­anced diet that in­cludes car­bo­hy­drate, pro­tein, fruit and veg­eta­bles in meals, as they pro­vide the nec­es­sary fuel for daily activities.</p>
    <p>RE­DUCE SALT IN­TAKE</p>
    <p>Re­duce your in­take of salt, sat­u­rated fat and choles­terol, while in­creas­ing that of fi­bre and potas­sium, lean pro­tein and high cal­cium from foods such as low-fat dairy.</p>
    <p>The daily con­sump­tion of salt a day should be less than 5g (one tea­spoon) as rec­om­mended by the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion. How­ever, in the Na­tional Nutri­tion Sur­vey 2020 con­ducted by Health Pro­mo­tion Board (HPB), Sin­ga­pore­ans were found to con­sume 8.3g daily.</p>
    <p>Di­etary salt oc­curs nat­u­rally in fresh food. It also comes from salt added in cook­ing, as well as pre­served and pro­cessed food.</p>
    <p>Choose fresh food over pre­served food, look out for HPB health­ier choice sym­bols such as "lower in sodium" or "no added sodium" and al­ways re­duce the use of ad­di­tional salt and sauces in cook­ing or at the ta­ble.</p>
    <p>EX­ER­CISE REG­U­LARLY</p>
    <p>Reg­u­lar phys­i­cal ac­tiv­ity is im­por­tant. The Min­istry of Health's rec­om­men­da­tion is to aim for at least 150 min­utes of mod­er­atein­ten­sity ex­er­cise a week, or at least 30 min­utes of mod­er­ate- in­ten­sity ex­er­cise five to seven days a week.</p>
    <p>DRINK AL­CO­HOL IN MODER­A­TION</p>
    <p>Al­co­hol should be con­sumed in moder­a­tion. It adds to calo­rie in­take and can cause weight gain.</p>
    <p>The rec­om­mended amount is one can of beer, one glass of wine or one shot of hard liquor a day, and drinkers should keep at least two al­co­hol-free days a week.</p>
