    <p>PARIS France re­ported a new record for daily coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions on Thurs­day, a day af­ter the gov­ern­ment an­nounced new re­stric­tions on bars and restau­rants in ma­jor cities that have pro­voked an out­cry from lo­cal politi­cians and busi­ness own­ers.</p>
    <p>Fig­ures from Pub­lic Health France showed 16,096 peo­ple tested pos­i­tive over the last 24 hours, a record – even though ex­perts said test­ing dur­ing the first coro­n­avirus wave in March-April cap­tured only a frac­tion of cases.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron’s gov­ern­ment an­nounced new mea­sures on Wed­nes­day to try to slow the spread of the dis­ease, in­clud­ing the clo­sure of all bars and restau­rants in Mar­seille and ear­lier clos­ing times in Paris and else­where.</p>
    <p>Faced with crit­i­cism from the may­ors of Paris and Mar­seille, le­gal chal­lenges and calls from some bar own­ers to defy the new or­ders, Prime Min­is­ter Jean Cas­tex called for “re­spon­si­bil­ity”.</p>
    <p>“What I don’t want is that we go back to March,” he said, re­fer­ring to one of the strictest na­tional lock­downs in Europe in which French peo­ple were re­quired to fill out forms to leave their homes.</p>
    <p>Mr Cas­tex also ad­mit­ted he has not down­loaded his own gov­ern­ment’s StopCovid con­tact-trac­ing app. “Yes I am push­ing the French to use it, but I do not,” he said on France 2 tele­vi­sion, ex­plain­ing that since be­com­ing premier in July, he “un­for­tu­nately” now crosses paths with fewer peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, hun­dreds of restau­rant own­ers and bar staff protested out­side Mar­seille’s com­mer­cial court against the gov­ern­ment or­der to shut for two weeks from to­day to curb the surge in new cases in France’s sec­ond-big­gest city.</p>
    <p>Mar­seille has been put on “max­i­mum alert”, while Paris and 10 other cities are at “el­e­vated alert” – the sec­ond tier on a new slid­ing scale sys­tem of in­fec­tion con­trol mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“I am an­gry be­cause there was no con­sul­ta­tion,” Mar­seille Mayor Michele Ru­birola, who is a doc­tor, told Fran­ce­info ra­dio.</p>
    <p>“Why turn the screws when our num­bers have been im­prov­ing for a few days now?” she asked.</p>
