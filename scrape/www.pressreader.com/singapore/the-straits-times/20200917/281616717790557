    <p>TOKYO • Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga’s first Cab­i­net shows a strong pref­er­ence for con­ti­nu­ity and sta­bil­ity, with eight min­is­ters kept in their po­si­tions from his pre­de­ces­sor Shinzo Abe’s team.</p>
    <p>But among the most no­table changes was the move of Mr Taro Kono, 57, from De­fence Min­is­ter to Ad­min­is­tra­tive Re­form Min­is­ter, a po­si­tion he pre­vi­ously held from 2015 to 2016. Suc­ceed­ing him as De­fence Min­is­ter is Mr Abe’s brother Nobuo Kishi, 61, who has close ties with Taiwan.</p>
    <p>Still, Mr Suga has stuck with stal­warts such as Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and Fi­nance Min­is­ter Taro Aso, 80, For­eign Min­is­ter Toshim­itsu Motegi, 64, Econ­omy, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Hiroshi Ka­jiyama, 64, and Eco­nomic and Fis­cal Pol­icy Min­is­ter Ya­su­toshi Nishimura, 57.</p>
    <p>The new Chief Cab­i­net Sec­re­tary is Mr Kat­sunobu Kato, 64, a close con­fi­dante of Mr Abe, who moved from the health, labour and wel­fare min­is­te­rial port­fo­lio to suc­ceed Mr Suga.</p>
    <p>Still, Mr Suga has por­trayed him­self as a re­formist, and yes­ter­day stressed his will to undo the “vested in­ter­ests, bad prece­dents and siloed sys­tems” that have hin­dered Ja­pan’s progress.</p>
    <p>He has also pre­vi­ously said he will make Cab­i­net ap­point­ments on merit, pri­ori­tis­ing re­form-minded peo­ple and sub­ject ex­perts over typ­i­cal horse-trad­ing that ac­com­pa­nies fac­tion pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>At 71, Mr Suga is Ja­pan’s old­est in­com­ing leader since the late Ki­ichi Miyazawa, who was 72 when he be­came prime min­is­ter in 1991.</p>
    <p>Yet, Mr Suga pre­sides over one of Ja­pan’s youngest Cab­i­nets, whose av­er­age age of 60.4 years makes it younger than the 61.6 years of the team ap­pointed in Mr Abe’s fi­nal Cab­i­net reshuf­fle last year.</p>
    <p>Two new roles were cre­ated in the new Cab­i­net. Mr Takuya Hi­rai, 62, is Dig­i­tal Min­is­ter, a role that re­places what was pre­vi­ously known as IT Pol­icy Min­is­ter. He will spear­head ef­forts to dig­i­talise Ja­pan’s bu­reau­cratic pro­cesses and pro­mote ar­eas such as telemedici­ne and e-learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Shinji Inoue, 50, is Min­is­ter-in-Charge of the 2025 Osaka World Expo.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in a set­back for gen­der equal­ity, there are only two women – one fewer than in Mr Abe’s out­go­ing Cab­i­net. The duo are Ms Seiko Hashimoto, 55, who keeps her post as Olympic Min­is­ter, and Ms Yuko Kamikawa, 67, who re­turns as Jus­tice Min­is­ter, after stints in 2014-2015 and in 2017-2018.</p>
    <p>The only min­is­ter un­der the age of 50 is Mr Shin­jiro Koizumi, 39, who keeps his po­si­tion as En­vi­ron­ment Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>It was Mr Kishi’s sud­den ap­point­ment as de­fence chief that has been de­scribed as the most sur­pris­ing move in what has been seen as an “Abe 3.0 Cab­i­net” by some an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>Mr Kishi is Mr Abe’s blood brother, but was adopted into Mr Abe’s ma­ter­nal fam­ily when he was born. This is why he shares the fam­ily name of for­mer prime min­is­ter Nobusuke Kishi, who led from 1957 to 1960. Mr Nobusuke Kishi is a found­ing mem­ber of the rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party (LDP), and had made con­sti­tu­tional re­vi­sion a key party ob­jec­tive.</p>
    <p>The new De­fence Min­is­ter has very close ties with Taiwan. Just last month, he vis­ited Taipei to at­tend the fu­neral of for­mer Tai­wanese pres­i­dent Lee Teng-hui. There, he also had an au­di­ence with cur­rent Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen.</p>
    <p>Mr Kishi’s ap­point­ment did not go un­no­ticed in China, where For­eign Min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin’s con­grat­u­la­tions came with a caveat. He said: “We also hope that Ja­pan will abide by the oneChina prin­ci­ple and avoid any form of of­fi­cial ex­changes with Taiwan.”</p>
    <p>Crit­ics have ques­tioned if the out­spo­ken Mr Kono was ef­fec­tively de­moted after ruf­fling feath­ers within the LDP in June, when he ditched the land­based Aegis Ashore mis­sile sys­tem with­out much con­sul­ta­tion, and last week, when he openly spec­u­lated that a snap elec­tion may be called next month.</p>
    <p>But Mr Suga yes­ter­day de­nied that was so, stress­ing that Mr Kono is a known re­formist who is best placed to push through changes against the odds.</p>
