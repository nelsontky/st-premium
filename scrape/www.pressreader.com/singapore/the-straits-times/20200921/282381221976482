    <p>Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer blamed a lack of prepa­ra­tion time for Manch­ester United’s l os­ing start to the English Premier League sea­son as Wil­fried Zaha scored twice against his for­mer club to hand Crys­tal Palace a 3-1 win at Old Traf­ford on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>United ended last sea­son a lit­tle over a month ago due to their run to the Europa League semi-fi­nals and had just two weeks of pre-sea­son train­ing to­gether.</p>
    <p>“You can see we are short and they de­served the points,” said the United man­ager. “We are not at our best yet be­cause this is the first game we’ve played since the mid­dle of Au­gust. We have had a very short and strange pre-sea­son.”</p>
    <p>United fin­ished last sea­son on a 14-match un­beaten run in the Premier League to se­cure third place.</p>
    <p>But on this ev­i­dence, they need far more than the soli­tary sign­ing of Donny van de Beek, who scored on his de­but, to com­pete at the top.</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer, though, re­fused to use a lack of new sign­ings as an ex­cuse.</p>
    <p>“We have to per­form bet­ter,” he added. “We are look­ing to im­prove if there is some­one avail­able at the right price. But we can look at our­selves in the mir­ror today in­stead.”</p>
    <p>Palace, who opened the scor­ing through An­dros Townsend, have now won their first two games of a top-flight sea­son for the first time in what was their sec­ond suc­ces­sive win at United.</p>
    <p>The last time Man United lost their league opener (2-1 to Swansea).</p>
    <p>The Ea­gles took a 2-0 lead when a penalty was awarded af­ter con­sul­ta­tion with the video as­sis­tant ref­eree (VAR) af­ter Jor­dan Ayew’s shot hit Vic­tor Lin­de­lof on the arm.</p>
    <p>David de Gea saved Ayew’s first penalty, but the spot-kick had to be re­taken as VAR deemed the Spa­niard to be off his line. Zaha con­verted from the spot be­fore en­sur­ing the three points were safe with Palace’s third.</p>
    <p>While Sol­sk­jaer crit­i­cised the VAR de­ci­sion, in­sist­ing “it was not a penalty”, for­mer United de­fender Gary Neville feels United will not be able to win the league with their cur­rent cen­tre-back part­ner­ship.</p>
    <p>“Over the years, the best part­ner­ships have al­ways had that re­ally quick one who has light­ning pace to get across and snuff out the dan­ger. Lin­de­lof and (Harry) Maguire just don’t have that,” he said.</p>
