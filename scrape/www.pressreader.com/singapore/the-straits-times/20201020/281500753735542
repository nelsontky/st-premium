    <p>Around 1,900 jobs have been made avail­able since April in Sin­ga­pore’s fast-grow­ing elec­tron­ics in­dus­try, which has out­per­formed other seg­ments of the econ­omy amid the coro­n­avirus-in­duced re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>The in­dus­try as a whole reaped $5.7 bil­lion in fixed as­sets in­vest­ment in the first nine months of the year and recorded $376 mil­lion in to­tal busi­ness ex­pen­di­ture.</p>
    <p>Just over 220 peo­ple were placed in jobs and trainee­ships between April and last month.</p>
    <p>Per­haps greater aware­ness of the op­por­tu­ni­ties avail­able will help to boost ap­pli­ca­tion rates, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo noted at a brief­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said at the same brief­ing that his min­istry and the eco­nomic agen­cies are “fir­ing on all cylin­ders” to cre­ate as many good jobs here as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>This is be­ing done by en­cour­ag­ing more start-ups to cre­ate op­por­tu­ni­ties for job cre­ation, help­ing lo­cal firms to scale up both do­mes­ti­cally and re­gion­ally, and at­tract­ing global com­pa­nies to set up in Sin­ga­pore and catal­yse the lo­cal in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Around 1,900 jobs were made avail­able in the fast-grow­ing elec­tron­ics in­dus­try between April and Septem­ber, with plenty still on of­fer, the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The vast ma­jor­ity of these posts, put up by over 130 com­pa­nies, were for pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs), mostly in tech­ni­cal roles.</p>
    <p>Monthly salaries for man­u­fac­tur­ing en­gi­neers in the elec­tron­ics clus­ter range from $1,800 to $3,225, with a me­dian of $2,575, while elec­tron­ics or me­chan­i­cal en­gi­neers would typ­i­cally get between $4,500 and $6,000.</p>
    <p>Non-tech­ni­cal roles such as sales and mar­ket­ing ex­ec­u­tives could fetch between $2,800 and $8,500 a month, with a me­dian of $3,450.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to the jobs, there are about 850 com­pany-hosted trainee­ships and at­tach­ments as well as 150 train­ing po­si­tions on of­fer in the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo told a brief­ing yes­ter­day that job seek­ers might think that they need a rel­e­vant tech­ni­cal back­ground to work in elec­tron­ics and the larger man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor, but this is not nec­es­sar­ily the case, even if many of the po­si­tions on of­fer are tech­ni­cal roles.</p>
    <p>“Job seek­ers who have tech­ni­cal back­ground, but come from dif­fer­ent sec­tors, may al­ready pos­sess many trans­fer­able skills. By ac­quir­ing ad­di­tional do­main knowl­edge, these job seek­ers can ac­cess op­por­tu­ni­ties in the elec­tron­ics in­dus­try,” she said, not­ing that un­fa­mil­iar­ity with what these jobs en­tail may be why ap­pli­ca­tions are on the low side.</p>
    <p>Just over 220 peo­ple, which is about fewer than 10 per cent of the to­tal po­si­tions avail­able, were placed in jobs and trainee­ships between April and last month. Close to half of those who took up new roles were work­ers over 40 years old.</p>
    <p>But per­haps greater aware­ness of the op­por­tu­ni­ties avail­able will help to boost ap­pli­ca­tion rates, said Mrs Teo, who was speak­ing after a visit to semi­con­duc­tor firm Glob­alFoundrie­s Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>She added: “It will be a great pity... if the com­pa­nies are not able to fill these po­si­tions. Ei­ther they can­not grow as fast as they wish or they have to find some way of fill­ing the po­si­tions, which in a sense, will be a loss to us, a loss to Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
    <p>OP­POR­TU­NI­TIES IN ELEC­TRON­ICS</p>
    <p>Over 70,000 work­ers spe­cial­is­ing in fields such as semi­con­duc­tor and con­sumer elec­tron­ics are em­ployed in the clus­ter.</p>
    <p>To­tal em­ploy­ment in the elec­tron­ics seg­ment grew by 1,000 between April and June de­spite Sin­ga­pore’s worst-ever quar­terly fall in em­ploy­ment, driven partly by the surge in de­mand for dig­i­tal goods and ser­vices dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“This is partly due to the move to­wards dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, re­sult­ing in the de­mand growth across the value chain,” Mrs Teo said.</p>
    <p>“As a re­sult, firms in (the elec­tron­ics seg­ment) are look­ing into build­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties, which in­volves hir­ing more peo­ple and of­fer­ing more job op­por­tu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>She noted that non-tech­ni­cal job roles are also on of­fer, and elec­tron­ics firms can also ben­e­fit from hir­ing in­di­vid­u­als who bring their ex­pe­ri­ence in ar­eas such as busi­ness de­vel­op­ment and pur­chas­ing from other sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Job seek­ers who lack rel­e­vant skills can tap Work­force Sin­ga­pore’s (WSG) 10 pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­grammes and place-and-train scheme to pick up ca­pa­bil­i­ties rang­ing from en­gi­neer­ing, sup­ply chain and lo­gis­tics, to tech­ni­cal sales, which will help them join the elec­tron­ics in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Com­pany-hosted trainee­ships and train­ing cour­ses such as those con­ducted by in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing are also avail­able to those look­ing to gain ex­po­sure to the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Firms in the elec­tron­ics clus­ter that are hir­ing i nclude Glob­alFoundrie­s Sin­ga­pore, Mi­cron Semi­con­duc­tor Asia Op­er­a­tions and Lite-On Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>TRANS­FER­ABLE SKILLS</p>
    <p>Job seek­ers who have tech­ni­cal back­ground, but come from dif­fer­ent sec­tors, may al­ready pos­sess many trans­fer­able skills. By ac­quir­ing ad­di­tional do­main knowl­edge, these job seek­ers can ac­cess op­por­tu­ni­ties in the elec­tron­ics in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>JOB SEARCH AS­SIS­TANCE</p>
    <p>The MOM’s weekly re­port out yes­ter­day also pro­vided an update on its ef­forts to help job seek­ers.</p>
    <p>It noted that 51,700 peo­ple re­ceived ba­sic ca­reer ad­vi­sory or job search as­sis­tance through ser­vices pro­vided by WSG and NTUC’s Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute from Jan­uary to last month.</p>
    <p>This is a 49 per cent in­crease on the same pe­riod last year and due to in­creased out­reach and higher de­mand from job seek­ers look­ing to make ca­reer tran­si­tions, the MOM said.</p>
    <p>A fur­ther 28,400 peo­ple re­ceived in­di­vid­u­alised ca­reer coach­ing over the nine-month pe­riod, it added.</p>
    <p>’’ MAN­POWER MIN­IS­TER JOSEPHINE TEO, on how job seek­ers might think that they need a rel­e­vant tech­ni­cal back­ground to work in elec­tron­ics and the larger man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor.</p>
