    <p>Renowned gy­nae­col­o­gist Yvonne Mar­jorie Salmon, who was in­volved in Sin­ga­pore’s first surgery to sep­a­rate Si­amese twins, died last Wed­nes­day. She was 94 years old.</p>
    <p>She served 44 years at the old Kan­dang Ker­bau Hos­pi­tal, now KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal (KKH), and was the first woman to lead its O&G de­part­ment in 1975. She re­tired in 1996.</p>
    <p>In 1961, she was one of two doc­tors who suc­cess­fully sep­a­rated a pair of Si­amese twins here.</p>
    <p>But one of the twins died hours after the surgery due to in­fec­tion. In 2003, she met the sur­viv­ing twin, Ms Karen Yong.</p>
    <p>In a trib­ute on Face­book last Fri­day, KKH said Dr Salmon was widely re­spected and well-loved by her friends, col­leagues, stu­dents and pa­tients.</p>
    <p>“She will be re­mem­bered as a car­ing friend, vi­sion­ary leader, an ex­tra­or­di­nary men­tor and an out­stand­ing clin­i­cian,” KKH said in the post.</p>
    <p>Dr Salmon, who never mar­ried but de­liv­ered many baby boomers, told The Straits Times in 2003 she had vivid mem­o­ries of the times when more than 100 ba­bies were born ev­ery day in 1966.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the book, The His­tory Of Ob­stet­rics And Gy­nae­col­ogy In Sin­ga­pore, Dr Salmon be­came a clin­i­cal pro­fes­sor at the Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore in 1977, now the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Kelvin Tan, head of KKH’s peri­na­tal au­dit and epi­demi­ol­ogy unit, was taught by Dr Salmon when he was a med­i­cal stu­dent and has fond mem­o­ries of her.</p>
    <p>He said: “She was to­tally ded­i­cated to her work and she had in­spired gen­er­a­tions of young doc­tors, many of whom took up O&G and be­came head of units and de­part­ments. She was al­ways cheer­ful and kind. When I vis­ited her after her re­tire­ment, she would al­ways greet me ‘Kelvin’, with a bright smile and sparkle.”</p>
    <p>The Eurasian As­so­ci­a­tion’s sec­ond vice-pres­i­dent Yvonne Pereira said Dr Salmon de­liv­ered her sec­ond child in 1982 and, at that time, the gy­nae­col­o­gist was “a sought-after and house­hold name”.</p>
    <p>“I re­mem­ber her be­ing friendly, kind, car­ing and most im­por­tantly, mak­ing me feel com­fort­able through­out my preg­nancy. She has paved the way and is a role model for the many Eurasians prac­tis­ing medicine to­day,” added Mrs Pereira.</p>
    <p>Dr Salmon’s fa­ther, the late Dr S.R. Salmon, was also a pi­o­neer in Sin­ga­pore’s O&G scene. He ran the Salmon Ma­ter­nity Home in Prin­sep Street from 1950 un­til it ceased op­er­a­tions in the 1980s.</p>
    <p>Dr Salmon’s cre­ma­tion ser­vice was held last Fri­day and the me­mo­rial ser­vice on Mon­day.</p>
