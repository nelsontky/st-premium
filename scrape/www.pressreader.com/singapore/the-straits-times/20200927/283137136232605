    <p>Start small, stay in­vested for the long term and know your own fi­nan­cial sit­u­a­tion – th­ese are among the top tips that ex­perts have for first­timers dur­ing this volatile pe­riod for in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Mark Chia, Stan­dard Char­tered Bank’s Sin­ga­pore head of man­aged in­vest­ments and eq­ui­ties, says: “Con­sider your ex­pe­ri­ence, risk ap­petite, fi­nan­cial sit­u­a­tion and tol­er­ance for po­ten­tial losses be­fore mak­ing any in­vest­ment de­ci­sion.”</p>
    <p>He adds that those who are new to eq­ui­ties trad­ing should start small and get ac­quainted with the var­i­ous as­pects of the stock mar­ket first.</p>
    <p>“Don’t jump in with both feet or put all your eggs into one bas­ket hop­ing to make a quick buck, you could end up los­ing ev­ery­thing,” he says.</p>
    <p>More ag­gres­sive traders can set a clear “stop loss” or “take profit” level to en­sure that any losses are lim­ited to a level in line with their risk ap­petite.</p>
    <p>Ms Evy Wee, DBS Bank’s head of fi­nan­cial plan­ning and per­sonal in­vest­ing, ad­vises: “While we recog­nise the im­por­tance of in­vest­ing early and wisely, do so with pos­i­tive cash flows af­ter you have set aside ad­e­quate emer­gency cash and in­sur­ance pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>“Set aside enough to cover at least three to six months of ex­penses, and more if you have de­pen­dants. It will en­able you and your fam­ily to tide over rough patches and avoid the need to liq­ui­date your in­vest­ments at an un­favourable time and price.</p>
    <p>“Your emer­gency funds will en­able you to weather rainy days and pro­vide the flex­i­bil­ity to cap­i­talise on mar­ket op­por­tu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>She also agrees that in­vestors should not bank ev­ery­thing on only one or two stocks as that cre­ates con­cen­tra­tion risk: “There is al­ways a chance that some­thing can go wrong with ei­ther of those com­pa­nies. Di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion is one way of man­ag­ing such risks.”</p>
    <p>Ms Wee adds that it is dif­fi­cult to time the mar­ket if you are not an avid trader.</p>
    <p>“Stud­ies on be­havioural fi­nance have shown that in­vestors tend to lose the best days in the mar­ket when they try to time the mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>In­vestors can in­stead adopt a dol­lar-cost-av­er­ag­ing ap­proach, where they in­vest a fixed amount reg­u­larly over a long pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“Over time, you will be buy­ing more units when the price is low, and fewer units when the price is high, re­sult­ing in low­er­ing the av­er­age cost of in­vest­ment,” Ms Wee says.</p>
    <p>“We do not know how the mar­ket will per­form ex­actly, so this strat­egy elim­i­nates the emo­tional stress of tim­ing the mar­ket and fol­lows a dis­ci­plined pro­gramme to pur­chase your in­vest­ment of choice.”</p>
    <p>Ms Wee also notes that in­vestors all too of­ten look only at the po­ten­tial re­turns with­out con­sid­er­ing the down­side: “Some tend to take on more risks in or­der to get po­ten­tially higher re­turns on their in­vest­ments with­out do­ing proper due dili­gence or un­der­stand­ing the prod­ucts.”</p>
    <p>But be­ing overly con­ser­va­tive also poses a risk, she notes.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, not in­vest­ing or in­vest­ing solely in very low-risk prod­ucts may re­sult in your sav­ings de­valu­ing due to in­fla­tion.</p>
    <p>“You may also run the risk of out­liv­ing your sav­ings due to longevity. To avoid and re­duce the pit­falls of mak­ing un­in­formed or poor in­vest­ment de­ci­sions, em­power your­self with fi­nan­cial know-how,” she says.</p>
    <p>Ms Wee rec­om­mends that peo­ple set up a holistic fi­nan­cial plan, as man­ag­ing fi­nances goes be­yond just buy­ing in­vest­ment prod­ucts or trad­ing in the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“To achieve a sus­tain­able level of fi­nan­cial well­ness, you need to have a ro­bust fi­nan­cial plan that of­fers clar­ity on your cash flow, en­ables you to plug your in­sur­ance gaps and helps you work your money harder.”</p>
    <p>For in­stance, DBS of­fers the NAV Plan­ner, which is a dig­i­tal ad­vi­sory tool that can help peo­ple nav­i­gate their fi­nan­cial jour­ney.</p>
    <p>It also in­cor­po­rates gov­ern­ment schemes like the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund and Sup­ple­men­tary Re­tire­ment Scheme.</p>
    <p>Mr David Ger­ald, pres­i­dent of the Se­cu­ri­ties In­vestors As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore), adds that the best course of ac­tion would be to go for high-qual­ity stocks with strong bal­ance sheets.</p>
    <p>“It might sound like an in­vest­ing cliche but buy­ing and hold­ing qual­ity in­vest­ments is al­ways the best strat­egy, even in hugely un­cer­tain times such as now.”</p>
    <p>Sue-Ann Tan</p>
    <p>PLAN FOR WORST-CASE SCE­NARIO</p>
    <p>Set aside enough (emer­gency cash) to cover at least three to six months of ex­penses, and more if you have de­pen­dants. It will en­able you and your fam­ily to tide over rough patches and avoid the need to liq­ui­date your in­vest­ments at an un­favourable time and price.</p>
