    <p>Pri­vate sec­tor lead­ers are set to join Thai Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha’s Cabi­net and help steer the econ­omy, which is fac­ing a down­turn ow­ing to the pan­demic. While tack­ling bread-and-but­ter is­sues, Bangkok needs to also grap­ple with the longer-term ques­tion of how it will en­gage the as­sur­gent stu­dents’ move­ment, says In­dochina bureau chief Tan Hui Yee. WORLD</p>
    <p>It is daunt­ing to face a down­turn with six min­is­te­rial seats va­cant, but that is where Thai Premier Prayut Chan-o-cha is at now, af­ter his fi­nance min­is­ter, en­ergy min­is­ter and four other Cabi­net mem­bers re­signed rather than wait for the axe in the up­com­ing reshuf­fle.</p>
    <p>Heap­ing pres­sure on Asean’s worst-per­form­ing econ­omy are grow­ing youth-led protests call­ing for the Par­lia­ment to be dis­solved.</p>
    <p>But this vac­uum in Mr Prayut’s govern­ment will not last for long, as cor­po­rate move­ments last week in­di­cate that rather than hand­ing the key jobs to pro­fes­sional politi­cians, he has con­vinced pri­vate sec­tor lead­ers to come aboard.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, Mr Predee Daochai re­signed from his po­si­tion as direc­tor and pres­i­dent of Kasiko­rn­bank. It was the day af­ter Mr Su­pat­tanapong Pun­meechaow re­lin­quished his di­rec­tor­ship at Thai en­ergy gi­ant PTT.</p>
    <p>They are fa­mil­iar faces, hav­ing given the Prayut govern­ment pol­icy ad­vice pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>How they steer the econ­omy next will de­ter­mine whether public dis­sat­is­fac­tion over the fall­out from the pan­demic will sharpen into more se­ri­ous un­rest.</p>
    <p>The World Bank had last month pro­jected that Thai­land’s econ­omy will shrink by at least 5 per cent this year, with as many as 8.3 mil­lion work­ers los­ing their jobs or in­come.</p>
    <p>“Eco­nomic dis­con­tent and gen­eral dis­sat­is­fac­tion with eco­nomic man­age­ment is not new and had cropped up a few years af­ter the 2014 coup, but Covid-19 has the po­ten­tial to catal­yse that well­spring of un­hap­pi­ness and cause even greater in­sta­bil­ity,” says Mr Har­ri­son Cheng, as­so­ciate direc­tor at con­sul­tancy Con­trol Risks.</p>
    <p>On the up­side, Bangkok has re­gained its foot­ing af­ter ini­tial panic about po­ten­tial re­newed com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion two weeks ago af­ter an Egyp­tian mil­i­tary of­fi­cer and the daugh­ter of a Su­danese diplo­mat who were not quar­an­tined on ar­rival were found to have tested pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Yet the episode also ex­posed the ex­tent of public fears over for­eign­ers im­port­ing in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s new eco­nomic team will have to sur­mount th­ese fears to save mil­lions of jobs.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, thou­sands of young peo­ple are lead­ing peace­ful demon­stra­tions na­tion­wide call­ing for the House to be dis­solved and the Con­sti­tu­tion to be changed.</p>
    <p>The po­lice have not made mass ar­rests so far, though it is un­clear if this sit­u­a­tion will con­tinue if ten­sions rise over un­flat­ter­ing posters of the monar­chy that have popped up in some of the ral­lies.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers con­cur that the protests alone do not pose an ex­is­ten­tial threat to the govern­ment. Former deputy prime min­is­ter Su­rapong Sueb­won­glee put it bluntly in a panel dis­cus­sion broad­cast on tele­vi­sion last Fri­day: “No protest can suc­ceed with­out any coup or in­ter­ven­tion from an ex­ter­nal power.”</p>
    <p>Eura­sia Group con­sul­tancy an­a­lyst Peter Mum­ford thinks the im­pact of the min­is­te­rial va­can­cies on in­vestor con­fi­dence will be mod­est be­cause Mr Prayut and the rest of his se­nior lead­er­ship re­main in place.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut’s co-lead­ers of the 2014 coup – re­tired gen­er­als Prawit Wong­suwan and Anupong Paochinda – re­tain their key roles as deputy prime min­is­ter and in­te­rior min­is­ter re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>And un­like rul­ing coali­tion leader Palang Pracharath Party, which re­cently saw its lead­ers ousted, Bhum­jaithai Party, a coali­tion heavy­weight, held an un­event­ful an­nual gen­eral meet­ing at the week­end, re­in­stat­ing Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Anutin Charn­vi­rakul as its leader.</p>
    <p>While tack­ling bread-and-but­ter is­sues, Bangkok needs to also grap­ple with the longer-term ques­tion of how it will en­gage the stu­dents’ move­ment.</p>
    <p>Stu­dent protest lead­ers last week re­port­edly re­jected a bid to es­tab­lish di­a­logue with the govern­ment through a par­lia­men­tary com­mit­tee, wary of be­ing co-opted rather than heard.</p>
    <p>Chu­la­longkorn Univer­sity po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Kanokrat Lertchoosa­kul says the cur­rent stu­dent move­ment is in­de­pen­dent of the ri­val fac­tions in Thai­land’s po­lit­i­cal land­scape.</p>
    <p>“For me, Thai­land will never be the same be­cause of this stu­dent move­ment,” she says. “They have be­come more crit­i­cal and rad­i­cal than what the mil­i­tary and es­tab­lish­ment has es­ti­mated.”</p>
    <p>In a sim­i­lar vein, Mr Cheng says: “Un­like move­ments led by prom­i­nent op­po­si­tion par­ties that can be neu­tralised by party dis­so­lu­tion tac­tics, or­ganic move­ments driven by pro-democ­racy and teen ac­tivists armed with so­cial me­dia ca­pa­bil­i­ties could be much harder to stop and con­tain.”</p>
    <p>DIF­FI­CULT TO CON­TAIN</p>
    <p>Un­like move­ments led by prom­i­nent op­po­si­tion par­ties that can be neu­tralised by party dis­so­lu­tion tac­tics, or­ganic move­ments driven by pro-democ­racy and teen ac­tivists armed with so­cial me­dia ca­pa­bil­i­ties could be much harder to ’’ stop and con­tain.</p>
