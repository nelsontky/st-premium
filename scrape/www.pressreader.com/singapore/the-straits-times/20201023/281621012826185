    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s 15-year-olds claimed the top spot in an in­ter­na­tional test that as­sessed their ca­pac­ity to un­der­stand and act on in­ter­cul­tural and global is­sues.</p>
    <p>The Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment (OECD), which con­ducted the test as part of the Pro­gramme for In­ter­na­tional Stu­dent Assess­ment (Pisa) study in 2018, an­nounced the find­ings yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In what was called the Global Com­pe­tence Test, Sin­ga­pore stu­dents scored an av­er­age of 576 marks, fol­lowed by their peers from Canada who on av­er­age scored 554, Hong Kong (542), Scot­land (534) and Tai­wan (527).</p>
    <p>About 46 per cent of the Sin­ga­pore stu­dents who took the test achieved the high­est global com­pe­tency pro­fi­ciency lev­els – 4 and 5. This is the high­est pro­por­tion com­pared with the av­er­age 14 per cent across the 27 ed­u­ca­tion sys­tems which par­tic­i­pated in the assess­ment.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) said to achieve pro­fi­ciency lev­els 4 and 5, stu­dents had to de­mon­strate a strong abil­ity to iden­tify and an­a­lyse dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives, eval­u­ate in­for­ma­tion to dif­fer­en­ti­ate be­tween bi­ased and un­bi­ased sources, as­sess sit­u­a­tions and make con­nec­tions across mul­ti­ple ac­tiv­i­ties within a prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Pisa is con­ducted ev­ery three years to as­sess stu­dents on their read­ing, maths and sci­ence skills, but in re­cent years, OECD has added more as­sess­ments on other skills, in­clud­ing col­lab­o­ra­tive prob­lem-solv­ing which was tested in Pisa 2015.</p>
    <p>On the need to as­sess global com­pe­tency, OECD said learn­ing to par­tic­i­pate in in­ter­con­nected, com­plex and di­verse so­ci­eties is no longer a lux­ury, but a press­ing ne­ces­sity and that schools are “cen­tral” to the teach­ing of these skills.</p>
    <p>The re­sults of the 2018 maths, sci­ence and read­ing tests were re­leased in De­cem­ber last year, with Sin­ga­pore com­ing in sec­ond place after China.</p>
    <p>In its state­ment, MOE said it had de­vel­oped in 2010 the “21st Cen­tury Com­pe­tency (21CC) frame­work” where it iden­ti­fied the knowl­edge, skills and val­ues that are im­por­tant for all stu­dents to thrive in the new econ­omy and in­ter­con­nected world.</p>
    <p>Schools since then have pro­vided both cur­ric­u­lar and co-cur­ric­u­lar learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ences to de­velop com­pe­ten­cies in these ar­eas.</p>
    <p>In the global com­pe­tence study, Sin­ga­pore stu­dents on av­er­age re­ported be­ing ex­posed to eight out of 10 learn­ing ac­tiv­i­ties sur­veyed by Pisa, while the OECD av­er­age was five.</p>
    <p>MOE said Sin­ga­pore’s lan­guage poli­cies and pro­grammes also con­trib­uted to the nur­tur­ing of global com­pe­tency knowl­edge, skills and at­ti­tudes.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the bilin­gual pol­icy and other lan­guage pro­grammes al­low stu­dents to learn the lan­guage of an­other com­mu­nity at a con­ver­sa­tional level. This has re­sulted in more than nine in 10 Sin­ga­pore stu­dents hav­ing the abil­ity to speak at least two lan­guages, said MOE.</p>
    <p>OECD noted that speak­ing mul­ti­ple lan­guages fa­cil­i­tates di­a­logue with peo­ple from other cul­tures, and pro­motes so­cial co­he­sion.</p>
    <p>MOE’s deputy di­rec­tor-gen­eral of ed­u­ca­tion (cur­ricu­lum) Sng Ch­ern Wei, said: “Re­cent events such as the Covid-19 pan­demic, with its world­wide ram­i­fi­ca­tions, have un­der­scored the con­tin­ued rel­e­vance of global com­pe­tence.”</p>
    <p>MOE noted that stu­dents from the bot­tom quar­ter so­cio-eco­nomic sta­tus (SES) also did well in the assess­ment, with about 26 per cent per­form­ing at the high­est two pro­fi­ciency lev­els com­pared with the OECD av­er­age of 6 per cent.</p>
    <p>It also noted that while Sin­ga­pore stu­dents were most knowl­edge­able on top­ics such as cli­mate change and global warm­ing, they were less con­fi­dent in ex­plain­ing is­sues re­lated to the global econ­omy. For in­stance, only about half of them could es­tab­lish a con­nec­tion be­tween prices of tex­tiles and work­ing con­di­tions in the coun­tries of pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said schools will con­tinue to pro­vide all stu­dents with var­ied learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ences, to help them de­velop their global com­pe­tence knowl­edge and skills.</p>
    <p>OECD di­rec­tor of ed­u­ca­tion and skills An­dreas Sch­le­icher told The Straits Times that Sin­ga­pore’s per­for­mance in the global com­pe­tence test is not sur­pris­ing.</p>
    <p>He said: “Whether it is the open and out­ward-look­ing cur­ricu­lum, the ac­tive pro­mo­tion of stu­dent ex­changes or cel­e­brat­ing fes­tiv­i­ties of mul­ti­ple cul­tures, few coun­tries do more to help stu­dents see the world through dif­fer­ent lenses, navigate dif­fer­ent ways of think­ing and ap­pre­ci­ate dif­fer­ent cul­tures and tra­di­tions.</p>
    <p>“And the Pisa re­sults show that those ac­tiv­i­ties shape stu­dents’ at­ti­tudes to­wards oth­ers and the world which, in turn, are re­li­able pre­dic­tors for global com­pe­tence.”</p>
