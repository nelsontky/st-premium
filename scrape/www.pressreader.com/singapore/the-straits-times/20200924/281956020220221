    <p>•</p>
    <p>BEI­JING/WASHINGTON China yes­ter­day hit back at a US move to ban im­ports from the north-west­ern Xin­jiang re­gion over claims of forced labour, be­moan­ing a “fab­ri­cated lie” that it says is in­tended to hurt Chi­nese busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The US House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives had on Tues­day voted over­whelm­ingly to ban Xin­jiang im­ports, vow­ing to stop what law­mak­ers say is sys­tem­atic forced labour by the Uighur eth­nic mi­nor­ity com­mu­nity in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>De­spite op­po­si­tion by US busi­nesses, the Act passed 406-3 in a sign of grow­ing out­rage over Xin­jiang, where ac­tivists say more than a mil­lion Uighurs and other mostly Mus­lim Tur­kic-speak­ing peo­ple have been in­car­cer­ated in camps.</p>
    <p>“Trag­i­cally, the prod­ucts of the forced labour of­ten end up here in Amer­i­can stores and homes,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said be­fore the vote. “We must send a clear mes­sage to Bei­jing: These abuses must end now.”</p>
    <p>Bei­jing re­acted an­grily over the move, say­ing that Washington was “ma­li­ciously slan­der­ing the hu­man rights sit­u­a­tion i n China’s Xin­jiang”.</p>
    <p>“China ex­presses strong in­dig­na­tion and firm op­po­si­tion, and had al­ready made stern rep­re­sen­ta­tions to the US,” For­eign Min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin said at a reg­u­lar press brief­ing.</p>
    <p>“Xin­jiang af­fairs are purely China’s in­ter­nal af­fairs. The US had no right to in­ter­fere. The so-called forced labour is­sue is a com­pletely fab­ri­cated lie by cer­tain West­ern or­gan­i­sa­tions and in­di­vid­u­als.”</p>
    <p>The Uighur Forced Labour Preven­tion Act still needs to be passed by the Se­nate, which may have lim­ited time be­fore the Nov 3 election.</p>
    <p>The United States al­ready bans prod­ucts made through slav­ery, but the Act would put a blan­ket ban on Xin­jiang prod­ucts as it says forced labour is in­ex­tri­ca­bly linked to the re­gion’s econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“We know forced labour is wide­spread and sys­tem­atic and ex­ists both within and out­side the mass in­tern­ment camps,” said Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Jim Mc­Gov­ern, a Demo­crat who helped lead the bi­par­ti­san Act.</p>
    <p>“These facts are con­firmed by the tes­ti­mony of former camp de­tainees, satel­lite im­agery and of­fi­cial leaked doc­u­ments from the Chi­nese government,” he said.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­can Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Chris Smith said: “We can­not be silent. We must de­mand an end to these bar­baric prac­tices and ac­count­abil­ity from the Chi­nese government.”</p>
    <p>Xin­jiang is a global hub for cot­ton, with one labour group’s study es­ti­mat­ing that 20 per cent of the US’ im­ported gar­ments con­tain at least some yarn from the re­gion.</p>
    <p>The Act passed de­spite crit­i­cism from the US Cham­ber of Com­merce, the coun­try’s pre­mier busi­ness lobby, which ar­gued that the law would pro­hibit le­git­i­mate com­merce rather than find ways to root out prod­ucts from forced labour.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the Act was in­tro­duced, the State Depart­ment is­sued an ad­vi­sory that it said would ed­u­cate US firms in Xin­jiang, and the US Cus­toms and Bor­der Pro­tec­tion agency said it was ban­ning spe­cific prod­ucts traced to forced labour in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang ac­cused the US of us­ing the claims of forced labour to “re­strict and op­press Xin­jiang busi­nesses”.</p>
    <p>Swedish cloth­ing gi­ant H&M said ear­lier this month that it was end­ing its re­la­tion­ship with a Chi­nese yarn pro­ducer over the labour ac­cu­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Ac­tivists and wit­nesses say that China is seek­ing to forcibly ho­mogenise the Uighur pop­u­la­tion in re-ed­u­ca­tion camps, in­clud­ing by re­strict­ing the prac­tice of Is­lam.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing last week pub­lished a White Pa­per staunchly de­fend­ing its pol­icy in Xin­jiang, where it says train­ing pro­grammes, work schemes and bet­ter ed­u­ca­tion mean life has im­proved.</p>
    <p>It has de­fended the train­ing cen­tres as nec­es­sary to stamp out ex­trem­ism.</p>
    <p>But US Home­land Se­cu­rity of­fi­cials have de­scribed the cen­tre as fa­cil­i­ties run like a “con­cen­tra­tion camp”.</p>
