    <p>Teach­ers in spe­cial ed­u­ca­tion (Sped) schools will have more room to progress in their ca­reers, through two new tracks in teach­ing and lead­er­ship. New hires will also go through a con­tract teach­ing stint and a longer diploma pro­gramme at the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Teach­ers in spe­cial ed­u­ca­tion (Sped) schools will have more room to progress in their ca­reers, through two new tracks in teach­ing and lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>New hires will also go through a con­tract teach­ing stint and a longer diploma pro­gramme at the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Ed­u­ca­tion (NIE).</p>
    <p>These were some of the plans laid out yes­ter­day by Ms Sun Xuel­ing, Minister of State for Ed­u­ca­tion, along with new ca­reer and train­ing guide­lines, to raise the standards of the Sped teach­ing pro­fes­sion and make it more at­trac­tive.</p>
    <p>In a Novem­ber 2018 re­view of hu­man re­source prac­tices in the Sped teach­ing sec­tor, the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) found that ex­ist­ing ca­reer frame­works vary across the 19 gov­ern­ment-funded Sped schools run by 12 so­cial ser­vice agen­cies.</p>
    <p>More than 70 per cent of Sped teach­ers, and so­cial ser­vice agen­cies which run the schools, were con­sulted for their views.</p>
    <p>These schools pro­vide cus­tomised sup­port for 6,600 stu­dents with mod­er­ate to se­vere spe­cial needs, such as autism and mul­ti­ple dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>At a vir­tual awards cer­e­mony yes­ter­day, Ms Sun said since the last hu­man re­source re­view for Sped teach­ers in 2007, there has been a steady rise in the num­bers of stu­dents with autism spec­trum dis­or­der.</p>
    <p>To cater to in­creas­ing en­rol­ment, the MOE in­tends to set up seven more Sped schools in the next seven years.</p>
    <p>The re­cent MOE study also found that Sped teach­ers wanted more clearly de­fined job roles and re­spon­si­bil­i­ties. There are cur­rently about 1,550 teach­ers across the Sped schools.</p>
    <p>“In the years to come, we en­vis­age the Sped pro­fes­sion to be a more at­trac­tive ca­reer with di­verse job op­por­tu­ni­ties for teach­ers,” said the MOE. Salaries will also be re­viewed from time to time, to match teach­ers’ com­pe­ten­cies and to en­sure mar­ket com­pet­i­tive­ness, it added.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Sun: “I know and deeply feel that, as pro­fes­sion­als, Sped teach­ers need and de­serve a ca­reer frame­work and a salary struc­ture com­men­su­rate with the height­ened de­mands on teach­ing as they serve the com­plex learn­ing needs of our stu­dents.”</p>
    <p>She added: “A dis­tinc­tive fea­ture of spe­cial ed­u­ca­tion is the need for a highly cus­tomised cur­ricu­lum with in­di­vid­u­alised ed­u­ca­tional and tran­si­tion plans. To de­velop and ex­e­cute such plans, we need highly ob­ser­vant and nim­ble teach­ers.”</p>
    <p>As part of the push to up­lift the Sped teach­ing sec­tor, a new ca­reer road map will in­tro­duce two tracks – lead­er­ship and teach­ing – with more av­enues for pro­gres­sion.</p>
    <p>This means that at some stage of their ca­reers, Sped teach­ers who show po­ten­tial and are keen on more se­nior roles can in­di­cate which track they want to be on.</p>
    <p>To pro­vide more clar­ity of roles and pro­gres­sion pos­si­bil­i­ties, there will be more lev­els for class­room teach­ers, in­clud­ing lead teacher and se­nior teacher. Those who choose the teach­ing path will fo­cus on lead­er­ship in teach­ing and learn­ing and men­tor­ing their peers. Cur­rently, such po­si­tions vary across schools.</p>
    <p>For those who opt for the lead­er­ship track, their roles in­clude de­vel­op­ing ed­u­ca­tional goals, lead­ing in the plan­ning of school-based curricula and pro­grammes, and de­vel­op­ing teach­ers for larger roles.</p>
    <p>The MOE has also drawn up a frame­work to de­fine the knowl­edge and skills re­quired for each job role, along with a train­ing road map to pro­vide learn­ing and de­vel­op­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>To equip them with more prac­ti­cal ex­pe­ri­ence, new Sped teach­ers will go through a con­tract teach­ing stint that will last from six to 12 months, be­fore un­der­go­ing a diploma in spe­cial ed­u­ca­tion (DISE) at NIE. Cur­rently, there is no such practice stint for Sped teach­ers.</p>
    <p>The teach­ing stint will start in January next year while the diploma course will be ex­tended from its cur­rent nine months to 12 months in 2022.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Sun: “To as­sist schools in hir­ing, de­vel­op­ing and man­ag­ing new Sped teach­ing re­cruits, MOE will also pro­vide fund­ing over the con­tract teach­ing pe­riod as well as pro­vide the al­lowance for teach­ers dur­ing their DISE course.”</p>
