    <p>Grab Hold­ings and Go­jek have made sub­stan­tial progress in work­ing out a deal to com­bine their busi­nesses in what would be the big­gest In­ter­net merger in South-east Asia, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple with knowl­edge of the talks.</p>
    <p>The re­gion’s two most valu­able start-ups have nar­rowed their dif­fer­ences of opin­ion, though some parts of the agree­ment still need to be ne­go­ti­ated, said the peo­ple, who asked not to be named be­cause the talks are pri­vate.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal de­tails are be­ing worked out among the most se­nior lead­ers of each com­pany, with the par­tic­i­pa­tion of Soft­Bank Group’s Mr Masayoshi Son, a major Grab in­vestor, one of the peo­ple said.</p>
    <p>Un­der one struc­ture with sub­stan­tial sup­port, Grab co-founder Anthony Tan would be­come the chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of the com­bined en­tity, while Go­jek ex­ec­u­tives would run the new com­bined busi­ness in In­done­sia un­der the Go­jek brand, the sources said.</p>
    <p>The two brands may be run sepa</p>
    <p>rately for an ex­tended pe­riod, one of the peo­ple said. The com­bi­na­tion is ul­ti­mately aimed at be­com­ing a pub­licly listed com­pany.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tives of Grab, Go­jek and Soft­Bank de­clined to com­ment. The talks are still fluid and may not re­sult in a trans­ac­tion, the peo­ple said. The deal would need</p>
    <p>reg­u­la­tory ap­proval and gov­ern­ments may have an­titrust con­cerns about the uni­fi­ca­tion of the re­gion’s two lead­ing ride-hail­ing com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Grab and Go­jek have been locked in a fierce, ex­pen­sive bat­tle for dom­i­nance in that busi­ness, along with food de­liv­ery and mo­bile pay</p>
    <p>ments, over the last sev­eral years.</p>
    <p>In­vestors have been push­ing for them to com­bine forces across South-east Asia to re­duce cash burn and create one of the most pow­er­ful In­ter­net com­pa­nies in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Grab, which is present in eight coun­tries, was last val­ued at more than US$14 bil­lion (S$18.8 bil­lion), while Go­jek, val­ued at US$10 bil­lion, has a pres­ence in In­done­sia, Sin­ga­pore, the Philip­pines, Thai­land and Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>Soft­Bank has been push­ing for a deal since Mr Son vis­ited In­done­sia in Jan­uary, but he has grown in­creas­ingly frus­trated with the lack of progress. The old ri­valry and per­son­al­ity clashes be­tween the two com­pa­nies’ lead­ers have led to dead­locked ne­go­ti­a­tions in the past, ac­cord­ing to one of the peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the talks.</p>
    <p>Sea’s rise as a for­mi­da­ble force in e-com­merce and dig­i­tal pay­ments has in­jected fresh im­pe­tus to the Grab-Go­jek con­ver­sa­tion, the peo­ple said.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore-based com­pany’s e-wal­let, ShopeePay, has been gain­ing mar­ket share at a rapid clip, aided by the grow­ing pop­u­lar­ity of Sea’s e-com­merce plat­form Shopee. That, in turn, is chal­leng­ing mar­ket lead­ers GoPay and Grab-backed Ovo in In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Sea’s sur­prise jour­ney from a scrappy start-up to South-east Asia’s most valu­able com­pany in the past 10 years has been the “big­gest in­spi­ra­tion” for lo­cal In­ter­net com­pa­nies lately, said Mr Ro­hit Si­pahi­malani, chief in­vest­ment strate­gist at Te­masek, which is an in­vestor in Go­jek.</p>
    <p>Sea went pub­lic in 2017 af­ter rais­ing more than US$720 mil­lion from in­vestors and now has a mar­ket value ap­proach­ing US$88 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple are now see­ing that the pub­lic mar­kets are a vi­able al­ter­na­tive for In­ter­net com­pa­nies in South-east Asia,” said Mr Si­pahi­malani.</p>
    <p>“But they also recog­nise that they need to get to a cer­tain scale, which is why the IPO (ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing) route is be­com­ing more at­trac­tive. I think that’s lead­ing to some di­a­logue around com­bi­na­tions and con­sol­i­da­tions in the re­gion.”</p>
    <p>He de­clined to com­ment on the Grab-Go­jek deal, adding that the Sin­ga­pore in­vest­ment com­pany is not tak­ing part in the ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
