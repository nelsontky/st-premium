    <p>•</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Football League (NFL) has stepped up its pandemic pro­to­cols with tougher re­stric­tions tak­ing ef­fect to­mor­row to try and mit­i­gate the spread of coro­n­avirus on the same day the Las Ve­gas Raiders found them­selves in the midst of an­other out­break.</p>
    <p>The stricter mea­sures, which will last un­til the end of the season, i nclude forc­ing Amer­i­can football play­ers to wear masks during prac­tice ses­sions, a 15-minute time limit per per­son in the dress­ing room, and mak­ing sure all play­ers and coaches have a neg­a­tive test from the pre­vi­ous day be­fore be­ing al­lowed into the club’s fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“Flex­i­bil­ity and adapt­abil­ity have been crit­i­cal to our suc­cess to date and we must con­tinue with that ap­proach,” NFL com­mis­sioner Roger Good­ell wrote in a memo to all the teams on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The league also said in the memo that 28 of the 32 teams had al­ready been slapped with tem­po­rary stricter mea­sures for Covid-19 rea­sons. Of the num­ber, 16 had been on them more than once.</p>
    <p>“The up­com­ing hol­i­days... will in­tro­duce new risks of ex­po­sure that we need to ad­dress now,” Good­ell added.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause we have a highly so­phis­ti­cated pro­gramme of daily test­ing, we know when the virus en­ters our fa­cil­i­ties, which un­der­scores the im­por­tance of con­tact trac­ing and other steps to min­imise close con­tacts within a fa­cil­ity.”</p>
    <p>Other pro­to­cols in­clude hold­ing meet­ings vir­tu­ally un­less out­doors or with pre-ap­proval for in­doors, locker room us­age dis­cour­aged on non-game days, meals served on a grab-and-go ba­sis and lim­its of 10 play­ers in the weight room at one time.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the lat­est test re­sults an­nounced by the league ear­lier this week, 95 play­ers and 175 team staff had tested pos­i­tive un­til last Satur­day since mon­i­tor­ing be­gan in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Teams have con­tin­ued to re­port cases of Covid-19 de­spite safety pro­to­cols put in place this season.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, the Raiders placed seven more play­ers on the Covid-19 re­serve list, four days be­fore they are due to host Su­per Bowl cham­pi­ons Kansas City Chiefs.</p>
    <p>Eleven Raiders are now on the list, although the game is ex­pected to go ahead.</p>
    <p>Their other play­ers will be lim­ited to virtual prac­tices and meet­ings un­til then and will not be al­lowed on the prac­tice field to­gether.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate devel­op­ment, the Los An­ge­les Rams also con­firmed a Covid-19 case – their first pos­i­tive re­sult this season.</p>
    <p>The team said on Wed­nes­day that they had placed tight end Ken­dall Blan­ton, de­fen­sive back Jake Ger­vase and wide re­ceiver J.J. Koski on the Covid-19 re­serve list.</p>
    <p>The NFL has not can­celled any games, with 19 teams ad­mit­ting fans this season.</p>
    <p>But the league last week in­tro­duced pro­vi­sions for an ex­panded play-off pool should Covid-19 force can­cel­la­tions, with an ul­ti­mate goal of see­ing the season end with the Fe­bru­ary Su­per Bowl in Tampa, Florida.</p>
