    <p>Premier League clubs yes­ter­day re­jected the use of five sub­sti­tutes, up from the usual three, for the third time this sea­son, likely spell­ing the end of the mo­tion to tem­po­rar­ily change the com­pe­ti­tion’s rules.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to mul­ti­ple Bri­tish me­dia re­ports, the lat­est vote at yes­ter­day’s share­holder meet­ing of the 20 clubs was dead­locked at 10 votes to 10, fall­ing short of the 14-6 ma­jor­ity re­quired un­der the reg­u­la­tions for any change.</p>
    <p>The pro­posal had been cham­pi­oned by the likes of Liver­pool man­ager Jur­gen Klopp and Manch­ester City coun­ter­part Pep Guardi­ola. How­ever, the Premier League re­mains the only ma­jor Euro­pean foot­ball league not to adopt the rul­ing, which has been al­lowed by the sport’s law­mak­ing body Ifab to cope with fix­ture con­ges­tion brought about by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But in what is seen as a con­ces­sion to the Premier League’s top clubs – the “Big Six” have been the ones push­ing for the change – a sep­a­rate vote to ex­tend the num­ber of sub­sti­tutes able to be named on the bench from seven to nine went through.</p>
    <p>De­spite Klopp and Guardi­ola’s vo­cal de­mands for five sub­sti­tutes, rail­ing against the lack of con­cern for player wel­fare, both man­agers have made use of their bench spar­ingly.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man did not make a sub­sti­tu­tion in Liver­pool’s 2-1 Premier League win over Tot­ten­ham on Wed­nes­day, while the Spa­niard has made only three sub­sti­tu­tions over City’s last two games. Guardi­ola has also used his full com­ple­ment of three sub­sti­tutes just thrice in the league this term.</p>
    <p>With the re­jec­tion of the mo­tion, this leaves the FA Cup as the only English com­pe­ti­tion that will per­mit the use of five sub­sti­tutes and this will be ev­i­dent when next month’s third round, which will see the en­try of Premier League clubs, com­mences.</p>
    <p>Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (FA) chief ex­ec­u­tive Mark Bulling­ham said: “The rea­son we want it (five sub­sti­tutes) in the com­pe­ti­tion is the rea­son most other leagues around the world have ap­plied it. That is, for player wel­fare.”</p>
    <p>In an­other sep­a­rate vote yes­ter­day, Premier League clubs agreed in prin­ci­ple to in­tro­duce ad­di­tional per­ma­nent con­cus­sion sub­sti­tu­tions af­ter the Ifab ap­proved tri­als. Fol­low­ing the agency’s de­ci­sion to give the go-ahead to tri­als on Wed­nes­day, the new rule will al­low a max­i­mum of two per­ma­nent con­cus­sion re­place­ments in cases of a head in­jury, re­gard­less of the num­ber of sub­sti­tu­tions a team has al­ready made.</p>
    <p>The new pro­to­cols will also al­low the op­pos­ing team to make an equiv­a­lent num­ber of changes and the Premier League said it hopes to be­gin tri­als by next month.</p>
    <p>“The trial is a re­sult of the Ifab’s con­sul­ta­tion with stake­hold­ers and rec­om­men­da­tions from their con­cus­sion ex­pert group to al­low ad­di­tional sub­sti­tu­tions for play­ers with ac­tual or sus­pected con­cus­sion,” it said in a state­ment.</p>
