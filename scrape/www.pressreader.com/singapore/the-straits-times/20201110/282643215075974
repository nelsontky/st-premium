    <p>A seag­ull steals food from our pic­nic blan­ket and soars away over crowds of Aus­tralian Foot­ball fans pil­ing into Perth’s Op­tus Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>Soon, as my wife, son and I dine on the grassy banks of the Swan River, we hear roars from 33,000 spec­ta­tors watch­ing West Coast play Colling­wood.</p>
    <p>It is early Oc­to­ber in this tur­bu­lent year of 2020, yet in Perth it still seems like the tran­quil days of 2019. The coro­n­avirus pan­demic ex­ists, just not here.</p>
    <p>Western Aus­tralia (WA) has gone al­most 200 days with­out a com­mu­nity-based Covid-19 in­fec­tion, thanks largely to its long ban on in­ter­na­tional and in­ter­state tourists, which be­gan in late March.</p>
    <p>Although WA has been closed to tourists for most of this year, it has not been in hi­ber­na­tion. For months now, Perth res­i­dents like my­self have led com­fort­able, nor­mal lives.</p>
    <p>I have been play­ing in a cricket com­pe­ti­tion, work­ing out at the gym, at­tend­ing ma­jor sports events, eat­ing at packed restau­rants, vis­it­ing crowded tourist des­ti­na­tions, brows­ing in busy shopping cen­tres, at­tend­ing the cinema and en­joy­ing mas­sages.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Perth au­thor­i­ties have taken the op­por­tu­nity to trans­form the city amid this global catas­tro­phe. When WA re­opens to trav­ellers, hope­fully some time in early-to-mid-next year, vis­i­tors will en­counter a re­vi­talised Perth.</p>
    <p>They will find the new $400-mil­lion WA Mu­seum, a $280-mil­lion over­haul of his­toric Fre­man­tle, a $100-mil­lion beach­front de­vel­op­ment in Scar­bor­ough, a re­vi­talised Perth wa­ter­front precinct, sev­eral new pub­lic squares and tourist at­trac­tions, a clus­ter of fresh fives­tar ho­tels, and plenty of new bars and restau­rants.</p>
    <p>This will be a pleas­ant change for trav­ellers, par­tic­u­larly those who have vis­ited Perth be­fore. Trust me, us lo­cals ap­pre­ci­ate the progress even more.</p>
    <p>You see, Perth has am­ple won­der­ful at­tributes, many of which it shares with Sin­ga­pore. Both cities are safe, clean, ef­fi­cient and boast a de­light­ful amount of green space.</p>
    <p>Where th­ese two me­trop­o­lises di­verge, quite clearly, is in the pace of de­vel­op­ment. Sin­ga­pore has sprinted into the fu­ture, em­bel­lish­ing its cityscape with unique, cut­ting-edge ar­chi­tec­ture like the Gar­dens by the Bay, Ma­rina Bay Sands and the ArtS­cience Mu­seum.</p>
    <p>Perth, by com­par­i­son, has tended to daw­dle. Its gen­tle speed of evo­lu­tion has helped main­tain its rep­u­ta­tion as a city with the pace and feel of a town. It barely seemed to change from the time I en­tered high school here in the mid-1990s to when I re­lo­cated over­seas in the late 2000s.</p>
    <p>Yet Perth’s ad­vance­ment was strik­ing to me when I moved back home in June this year, es­cap­ing the strict pan­demic lock­down I en­dured in Europe.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, it seems like a city on the march. In the past five years, Perth has opened the ap­peal­ing El­iz­a­beth Quay river­front precinct, the 60,000-seat Op­tus Sta­dium, the dis­tinc­tive City of Perth Li­brary, the el­e­gant State Build­ings din­ing and boutiques com­plex, and the Ya­gan Square de­vel­op­ment which links the Cen­tral Busi­ness District with its en­ter­tain­ment precinct North­bridge.</p>
    <p>Now Perth is build­ing on that mo­men­tum. On Nov 21, the doors will open to one of the largest mu­se­ums in Aus­tralia. The 120-year-old WA Mu­seum in North­bridge has been com­pre­hen­sively ren­o­vated and ex­tended, al­most quadru­pled in size, with close to 6,000 sq m of gallery space.</p>
    <p>A hulk­ing new metal­lic struc­ture has been built over five of Perth’s most at­trac­tive her­itage build­ings, cre­at­ing a mu­seum with a dis­tinc­tive fu­sion of colo­nial and mod­ern ar­chi­tec­tural styles.</p>
    <p>It will ex­plain WA’s his­tory via its cul­tural and sci­en­tific col­lec­tions, which will be dis­played in eight new gal­leries and a 1,000 sq m tem­po­rary ex­hi­bi­tion space. I am es­pe­cially ex­cited to see how this fa­cil­ity por­trays the his­tory and cul­ture of the state’s indige­nous peo­ple, who are among the old­est civil­i­sa­tions on the planet.</p>
    <p>This new mu­seum is sur­rounded by the State Theatre, the State Li­brary, the Art Gallery of WA, the Perth In­sti­tute of Con­tem­po­rary Arts and the Blue Room Theatre.</p>
    <p>To­gether they form an im­pres­sive arts precinct called the Perth Cul­tural Cen­tre. While my home city has long been crit­i­cised for its lack of cul­ture, this clus­ter now of­fers a ro­bust re­tort.</p>
    <p>Early next year, the Art Gallery of WA will be en­hanced by El­e­vate, a new art ex­hi­bi­tion space and rooftop venue with strik­ing views of the Perth sky­line.</p>
    <p>El­e­vate will have an i ndoor gallery, an open-air sculp­ture walk, and the city’s largest rooftop venue, ca­pa­ble of host­ing 500 peo­ple and cen­tred around a 34m-long Abo­rig­i­nal art­work. This enor­mous mu­ral, by Noon­gar indige­nous artist Christo­pher Pease, will de­pict Der­barl Yer­ri­gan, the abo­rig­i­nal name for Perth’s Swan River.</p>
    <p>Tourists to the Perth Cul­tural Cen­tre will also en­joy the greater range of restau­rants, bars and ho­tels in its vicin­ity. At its western edge, the his­toric, four-storey Rech­abite Hall re­opened late last year as four sep­a­rate venues – a bar, restau­rant, night­club, and live per­for­mance hall.</p>
    <p>Just a few min­utes’ walk away, the 128-year-old Royal Ho­tel, which has wit­nessed hi­jinks from card-game scuf­fles and sheep jump­ing through win­dows, has just been stylishly ren­o­vated. Its menu in­cludes con­tem­po­rary shar­ing plates, which can be en­joyed on its huge bal­cony over­look­ing lively North­bridge precinct.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, three new ho­tels have re­cently opened i n i nner Perth – the Ritz-Carl­ton, Novo­tel</p>
    <p>Mur­ray Street and Ad­nate Art Se­ries Ho­tel – with the Dou­bleTree Hil­ton Wa­ter­front, Vibe Su­bi­aco Ho­tel and Dorsett Perth set to fol­low in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>The Ritz-Carl­ton and Hil­ton prop­er­ties join an­other re­cently opened ho­tel, Quay Perth, on the city’s El­iz­a­beth Quay wa­ter­front precinct. For a long time in Perth, we thirsted for a lively river­side area, like Syd­ney’s Dar­ling Har­bour.</p>
    <p>Since its first stage opened in 2016, the ever-evolv­ing El­iz­a­beth Quay de­vel­op­ment – with its mix of ho­tels, restau­rants and bars around a beau­ti­fully land­scaped ma­rina – has be­gun to sat­isfy this ap­petite.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the curved Swan River east from here, tourists will soon find a re­li­able source of adren­a­line. Open­ing early next year, a 400m</p>
    <p>long zi­pline at Mata­garup Bridge will send thrill-seek­ers hurtling over the river at up to 100kmh.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors will also be able to scale this new, snake-shaped bridge’s main arch, climb­ing up to its 70mhigh view­ing plat­form. This al­ready is one of my favourite re­lax­ation spots in Perth, thanks to the gor­geous parks which flank the bridge on both sides of the river, and will soon have even greater ap­peal.</p>
    <p>Perth’s progress is not just lim­ited to its in­ner sub­urbs. Its his­toric satel­lite city of Fre­man­tle, 15km south-west of down­town Perth, is un­der­go­ing its big­gest re­de­vel­op­ment in decades.</p>
    <p>Kings Square, the hub of Fre­man­tle, has been beg­ging to be over­hauled and next April it will re­open with an invit­ing blend of shops, bars, restau­rants, art gal­leries, of­fice space, and a new pub­lic square.</p>
    <p>Some 20km off the coast of Fre­man­tle, Perth’s beloved is­land get­away Rot­tnest is mor­ph­ing, too. It has just wel­comed Sam­phire Rot­tnest, a lux­u­ri­ous beach­front ho­tel with 80 rooms, which com­ple­ments the Dis­cov­ery eco-re­sort that opened on the is­land last year.</p>
    <p>From the high­est point on Rot­tnest, you can al­most spot the su­perb new ocean­side precinct at Scar­bor­ough. While this gor­geous beach has long been a favourite haunt for Perth lo­cals, it’s never had much to at­tract tourists, aside from its crys­talline ocean wa­ters.</p>
    <p>Now, how­ever, the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties are fin­ish­ing off a $100-mil­lion re­de­vel­op­ment. It fea­tures an eight-lane beach pool, a clus­ter of new cafes and bars, the Sun­set Hill scenic view­point, ex­ten­sive land­scaped parks, and a recre­ational area with a climb­ing wall, bas­ket­ball court, chil­dren’s play­ground, and skate park.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, all th­ese ad­di­tions to Perth have no ob­vi­ous draw­backs, even from the per­spec­tive of a long-term res­i­dent. Progress has not come at a cost. Perth still has all the qual­i­ties that have made it a pop­u­lar des­ti­na­tion for Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>It still is re­mark­ably spa­cious, green and peace­ful for a city of 2.1 mil­lion peo­ple. It still has end­less un­crowded and pris­tine beaches.</p>
    <p>It still has densely forested national parks just 30 min­utes from its cen­tre. It still is blan­keted by wild­flow­ers six months a year and home to ex­otic na­tive an­i­mals year-round.</p>
    <p>It still has a huge range of cui­sine thanks to its mul­ti­cul­tural pop­u­la­tion. And still it is one of the friendli­est, safest and most laid­back cities on the planet.</p>
    <p>It cer­tainly helps that the pan­demic did not have the same im­pact all the way down here. Once this cri­sis abates, Perth will warmly re-ac­cept tourists, who will find an up­dated and even more al­lur­ing city.</p>
