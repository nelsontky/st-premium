    <p>LON­DON • Marks & Spencer, the Bri­tish re­tail chain sell­ing clothes and food, is to cut around 7,000 jobs as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic in­creas­ingly pushes cus­tomers to shop on­line, it said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The job cuts, to be car­ried out over the next three months, in­clude losses from its cen­tral sup­port cen­tre, in re­gional man­age­ment and in its UK stores, it said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>M&S em­ploys more than 80,000 staff, of whom the vast ma­jor­ity work in Bri­tain. Chief ex­ec­u­tive Steve Rowe said the com­pany would be­come a “leaner, faster busi­ness set up to serve chang­ing cus­tomer needs”.</p>
    <p>Along­side the job cuts, M&S ex­pects to cre­ate a num­ber of po­si­tions to help the group meet a surge in on­line demand for its prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>While to­tal group sales slumped by around one fifth in the 19 weeks to Aug 8 – which in­cluded most of the pe­riod Bri­tain was in lockdown – on­line rev­enue surged nearly 40 per cent, M&S said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The com­pany joins the likes of Bri­tish depart­ment store chains Deben­hams and John Lewis, as well as phar­macy group Boots, in cut­ting thou­sands of jobs ow­ing to fall­out from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The cuts are not ex­pected to im­pact M&S’ Sin­ga­pore op­er­a­tions, which are un­der the um­brella of Dubai-based con­glom­er­ate Al-Fut­taim Group. M&S has 10 re­tail stores and food halls in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>When The Straits Times con­tacted the brand, it de­clined to com­ment on its Sin­ga­pore busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cial data last week showed that Bri­tain’s econ­omy shrank by one fifth in the sec­ond quar­ter, more than any Euro­pean neigh­bour, as the lockdown plunged the coun­try into its deep­est re­ces­sion on record.</p>
    <p>Even though the Bri­tish econ­omy is be­gin­ning to rebound as the gov­ern­ment eases strict con­fine­ment mea­sures – gross do­mes­tic prod­uct grew by 8.7 per cent in June – an­a­lysts ex­pect a surge in un­em­ploy­ment by the end of the year, with an aid scheme set to end in Oc­to­ber.</p>
