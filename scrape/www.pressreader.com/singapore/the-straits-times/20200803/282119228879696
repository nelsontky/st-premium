    <p>Even as the United States leads in over­all patent and trade­mark ap­pli­ca­tions in Sin­ga­pore, more Chi­nese com­pa­nies are also fil­ing here, post­ing the fastest growth rate among Asian coun­tries in the last three years.</p>
    <p>Fig­ures f rom the In­tel­lec­tual Prop­erty Of­fice of Sin­ga­pore (Ipos) show Alibaba Group and Huawei Tech­nolo­gies ahead of US giants Qual­comm and Ama­zon Tech­nolo­gies as the top in­di­vid­ual patent and trade­mark fil­ing ap­pli­cants last year re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Over­all, there was an in­crease in patent fil­ings, and not just from the US.</p>
    <p>“In fact, the growth in Sin­ga­pore patent fil­ings has con­tin­ued into the first half of 2020, de­spite the dif­fi­cult eco­nomic con­di­tions brought about by Covid-19,” said Ms Shar­maine Wu, di­rec­tor of patents, de­signs and plant va­ri­eties at Ipos.</p>
    <p>“This is tes­ta­ment to Sin­ga­pore’s po­si­tion as an in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty (IP) hub and gate­way into Asean and be­yond.</p>
    <p>“Over the years, Ipos has im­proved the qual­ity and speed of our IP ser­vices, en­hanced Sin­ga­pore’s global IP con­nec­tiv­ity and es­tab­lished an IP regime that is well­recog­nised in­ter­na­tion­ally.”</p>
    <p>Patents pro­tect tech­ni­cal in­ven­tions used in in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>While it was mostly phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies that took ad­van­tage of the patent reg­is­tra­tion sys­tem 20 years ago, to­day, any­thing tech­nol­ogy-re­lated is backed by patents, said lawyers from IP law firm Joyce A. Tan & Part­ners.</p>
    <p>Trade­marks, un­like patents, are about brands.</p>
    <p>“Just for brand recog­ni­tion and rep­u­ta­tion, con­sumers are sim­ply pre­pared to pay more for ‘Panadol’ than a generic parac­eta­mol tablet, even though it is the same thing,” they noted.</p>
    <p>De­sign – one of the three cat­e­gories tracked in the Ipos 2019 fig­ures – is about aes­thet­ics.</p>
    <p>“Con­sumers will pay for some­thing that l ooks cool,” said the lawyers.</p>
    <p>An Ipos spokesman added: “When you regis­ter a de­sign, you pro­tect the ex­ter­nal ap­pear­ance of the ar­ti­cle or non-phys­i­cal prod­uct, and have the right to con­trol its use.”</p>
    <p>De­sign refers to fea­tures such as shape, con­fig­u­ra­tion, colours, pat­tern or or­na­ment that dis­tin­guish the ar­ti­cle or non-phys­i­cal prod­uct.</p>
    <p>The spokesman added: “As an owner of the reg­is­tered de­sign, you can pre­vent oth­ers from us­ing the de­sign with­out per­mis­sion. You can also use your reg­is­tra­tion to pro­tect your mar­ket share by bar­ring copy­ing by oth­ers, li­cense to third par­ties for com­mer­cial re­turns or sell the de­sign for mon­e­tary re­turns.”</p>
    <p>While the top filer for patents last year was Alibaba Group, and Huawei for trade­mark, Ap­ple topped the list for de­sign.</p>
    <p>Coun­try-wise, there were 4,564 patent ap­pli­ca­tions from the US, up from 3,473 in 2018. Ja­pan was se­cond, Sin­ga­pore third and China fourth.</p>
    <p>While J apan has con­sis­tently been the top Asian filer, Chi­nese ap­pli­cants recorded the high­est growth be­tween 2017 and last year, with a 55 per cent in­crease, from 645 to 1,554 patent ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>For­mer IP lawyer and le­gal tal­ent re­cruiter Lee Shulin said the over­all rise in fil­ings to Ipos shows the le­gal mar­ket for IP and tech­nol­ogy has evolved to new lev­els of so­phis­ti­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“Whereas IP law used to be an af­ter­thought for many com­pa­nies in the past, now they are want­ing to be on the fore­front, lead­ing to an in­crease in fil­ings for patents largely due to them want­ing to make full use of the ro­bust IP frame­work in Sin­ga­pore,” said Ms Lee, di­rec­tor of re­cruit­ment firm ANSA Search.</p>
    <p>She noted a sig­nif­i­cant in­crease in de­mand in the last few years for IP lawyers and patent en­gi­neers at Chi­nese com­pa­nies and fin­tech firms.</p>
    <p>Vet­eran IP lawyer Joyce A. Tan said: “Look­ing at the num­bers and trends in reg­is­tra­tion will give valu­able in­sight on where the in­no­va­tion is com­ing from and what the fu­ture brings, even if the num­bers don’t tell us ev­ery­thing.”</p>
    <p>She said the US will re­main ahead of the pack for “yet a while” as its busi­ness com­mu­nity has a good un­der­stand­ing of how much more prof­itable and bet­ter cap­i­talised a busi­ness can be if it in­vests in IP.</p>
    <p>“Just l ook at tech giants like Google, Face­book, et cetera – their val­u­a­tions and their fi­nan­cial war chests are built on a very sea­soned un­der­stand­ing of how to use IP as as­sets. Few coun­tries have pow­ered their eco­nomic growth us­ing IP rights the way the US has.”</p>
    <p>Mr Kris­tian Robin­son, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Spru­son & Fer­gu­son (Asia), noted the ma­jor­ity of patent ap­pli­cants in Sin­ga­pore are off­shore, pre­dom­i­nantly the US, Europe and Ja­pan, “as th­ese ju­ris­dic­tions have tra­di­tion­ally had much larger tech­nol­ogy sec­tors”.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, in more re­cent times, our firm has seen a greater num­ber of Chi­nese com­pa­nies fil­ing in Sin­ga­pore and us­ing Sin­ga­pore as a launch pad for ac­cel­er­at­ing ex­am­i­na­tion in other coun­tries in South­east Asia,” added Mr Robin­son.</p>
    <p>Lawyer Joseph Tan Chin Aik, who has watched the Chi­nese IP scene</p>
    <p>for a decade, said the rise of China’s IP un­der­tak­ings on a global scale has been “over­whelm­ingly sig­nif­i­cant”.</p>
    <p>He noted that ac­cord­ing to the World In­tel­lec­tual Prop­erty Or­gan­i­sa­tion (Wipo), China filed 58,990 ap­pli­ca­tions via Wipo’s Patent Co­op­er­a­tion Treaty (PCT) sys­tem last year, over­tak­ing the US as the big­gest user of the PCT sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Mr Robin­son added that overseas clients’ feed­back showed they liked to file in Sin­ga­pore be­cause the stan­dards of ex­am­i­na­tion are high, mak­ing them highly likely to be en­forced and very rapidly, com­pared with other ju­ris­dic­tions.</p>
    <p>He noted Ipos has been quite in­no­va­tive with pro­grammes to speed up ex­am­in­ing and grant­ing patent ap­pli­ca­tions, which has boosted Sin­ga­pore as an at­trac­tive fil­ing ju­ris­dic­tion. Last year, a fast­track pro­gramme granted Alibaba a patent within three months – a world record.</p>
    <p>“We are see­ing more com­pa­nies like Alibaba want­ing to first file in Sin­ga­pore and then us­ing their rapidly granted patent to spring­board into other ju­ris­dic­tions.”</p>
    <p>Ipos launched the SG Patent Fast Track Pi­lot Pro­gramme this year, which ac­cel­er­ates patent ap­pli­ca­tions in all fields of tech­nol­ogy to be granted in as lit­tle as six months.</p>
    <p>“Even as the ef­fects of Covid-19 con­tinue to be felt, busi­nesses and in­no­va­tors con­tinue to in­vest in IP pro­tec­tion to cap­ture new op­por­tu­ni­ties that emerge or pre­serve longer-term in­ter­ests. Ipos will con­tinue to de­velop new ini­tia­tives to sup­port them,” said its spokesman.</p>
    <p>The im­pact of Covid-19 on IP will be a key topic of dis­cus­sion at this year’s IP Week @ SG, which will go on­line from Aug 25 to Aug 27.</p>
    <p>CON­TIN­UED GROWTH</p>
    <p>The growth in Sin­ga­pore patent fil­ings has con­tin­ued into the first half of 2020, de­spite the dif­fi­cult eco­nomic con­di­tions brought ’’ about by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>MS SHAR­MAINE WU, di­rec­tor of patents, de­signs and plant va­ri­eties at Ipos.</p>
    <p>NO MORE AN AF­TER­THOUGHT</p>
    <p>Whereas IP law used to be an af­ter­thought for many com­pa­nies... now they are want­ing to be on the fore­front, ’’ lead­ing to an in­crease in fil­ings. MS LEE SHULIN, le­gal tal­ent re­cruiter.</p>
    <p>SIN­GA­PORE FIRST</p>
    <p>We are see­ing more com­pa­nies like Alibaba want­ing to first file in Sin­ga­pore and then us­ing their... patent to spring­board into other ’’ ju­ris­dic­tions.</p>
    <p>MR KRIS­TIAN ROBIN­SON, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Spru­son & Fer­gu­son (Asia).</p>
