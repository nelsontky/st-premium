    <p>SHANG­HAI • China yes­ter­day re­ported the high­est num­ber of asymp­to­matic coron­avirus in­fec­tions in nearly seven months, fol­low­ing the dis­cov­ery of a clus­ter of cases linked to a gar­ment fac­tory in the north-western re­gion of Xin­jiang.</p>
    <p>The health au­thor­i­ties found 137 asymp­to­matic cases on Sun­day dur­ing a drive to test 4.75 mil­lion peo­ple in the Kash­gar area, trig­gered by an asymp­to­matic in­fec­tion in a 17-year-old fe­male gar­ment fac­tory worker re­ported the day be­fore.</p>
    <p>It was not clear how the teenager was in­fected though the of­fi­cial Xin­hua news agency said all of the new cases were linked to an­other gar­ment fac­tory where the pa­tient’s par­ents work.</p>
    <p>The par­ents had not tested pos­i­tive for the virus, how­ever, it said.</p>
    <p>The teenager’s in­fec­tion was dis­cov­ered dur­ing rou­tine weekly test­ing in Xin­jiang for what Xin­hua called key groups of peo­ple. It did not spec­ify who were in those groups or why the teen was among those tested. Con­tact-trac­ing to lo­cate the ori­gin of the out­break was go­ing on, the me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 20 new con­firmed and 161 new asymp­to­matic cases were re­ported in the main­land on Sun­day, the Na­tional Health Com­mis­sion said in a state­ment. The num­ber of new symp­tom­less in­fec­tions was the high­est since China be­gan re­port­ing daily counts of those cases on April 1.</p>
    <p>More than 2.84 mil­lion peo­ple in the Kash­gar area had been tested as of Sun­day af­ter­noon, with the rest ex­pected to be com­pleted by to­day.</p>
    <p>The scale and speed of the test­ing are in line with ef­forts to stamp out other re­cent clus­ters of in­fec­tion in China, in­clud­ing one in Qing­dao city ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>Though the num­ber of new cases is down sharply in main­land China from peaks in Fe­bru­ary, the gov­ern­ment is wary of an­other wave of in­fec­tions and main­tains mass, rapid test­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The virus first emerged in the cen­tral city of Wuhan late last year. The to­tal num­ber of con­firmed cases in main­land China stands at 85,810, while the death toll re­mains un­changed at 4,634.</p>
