    <p>NEW YORK • Ten­nis re­mains a fam­ily game, and for­mer French Open cham­pion An­dres Gomez’s five chil­dren all be­came good enough to play col­lege ten­nis in the United States.</p>
    <p>Only one be­came good enough to fol­low their fa­ther’s path and play in the French Open, and when Emilio Gomez took to Court 3 on Mon­day for his Grand Slam tour­na­ment de­but, An­dres Gomez was back home in Guayaquil, Ecuador, watch­ing it on a screen in the early morn­ing.</p>
    <p>His son got close, very close, push­ing Lorenzo Sonego of Italy to a fifth set, but there will be no se­cond round for the younger Gomez. Sonego pre­vailed 6-7 (6-8), 6-3, 6-1, 6-7 (4-7), 6-3 in just over four hours.</p>
    <p>“That’s how ten­nis goes,” An­dres Gomez said by tele­phone. “I’m still happy. Ob­vi­ously, I would have wanted a dif­fer­ent re­sult to­day, but clay is not his best sur­face. Good things are com­ing for him, I think.”</p>
    <p>Just reach­ing the main draw was quite a jour­ney for Emilio Gomez, a for­mer col­le­giate player at the Univer­sity of South­ern Cal­i­for­nia. He is 28 and nearly quit the game in 2018 after a string of dis­ap­point­ing re­sults, only de­cid­ing to push on after win­ning two satel­lite events in Ecuador. But in this strange and dis­jointed sea­son, he fi­nally broke through in Paris, com­ing through three rounds of qual­i­fy­ing.</p>
    <p>Thirty years after his fa­ther won the French Open in 1990, de­feat­ing An­dre Agassi, Emilio made it into the main draw, break­ing into tears.</p>
    <p>“To be on the courts where my fa­ther won is some­thing spe­cial,” said Emilio, ranked 155th. “I’m not a first-level player like him, but I en­joy it.”</p>
    <p>Choos­ing the same path as a cham­pion par­ent is not with­out its per­ils. “Emilio had to carry the name on the back, and it was a heavy load, some­times even heav­ier be­cause he thought it was heavy,” An­dres said.</p>
    <p>“But I think Emilio started to en­joy be­ing my son. Every­body is the son of some­body, and there’s al­ways ex­pec­ta­tions and some­times ex­pec­ta­tions are a lit­tle tougher on some of them.”</p>
    <p>The next challenge for the late­bloomer: Mak­ing the main draw at another Grand Slam tour­na­ment on a sur­face bet­ter suited to his tight-to-the-base­line game.</p>
    <p>Emilio is not the only child of a Grand Slam cham­pion mak­ing his main-draw de­but at this year’s French Open. There is also Se­bas­tian Korda, a 20-year-old Amer­i­can who will face John Is­ner in the se­cond round of men’s sin­gles to­day.</p>
    <p>Korda’s fa­ther and coach is Petr Korda, the 1998 Aus­tralian Open cham­pion from the Czech Re­pub­lic who also reached the French Open fi­nal in 1992, los­ing to Jim Courier.</p>
    <p>But the next-gen­er­a­tion Kor­das are not just ten­nis play­ers.</p>
    <p>Petr Korda and his wife, Regina, who was also a lead­ing Czech player, also have two older daugh­ters: Jes­sica, 27, and Nelly, 22, who are two of the lead­ing women’s pro­fes­sional golfers and each has won mul­ti­ple LPGA Tour ti­tles.</p>
    <p>“They are hav­ing a good year this year, so we’re al­ways in con­tact, and we’re al­ways talk­ing about what we can do bet­ter, and how we’re do­ing it,” Se­bas­tian said of his sis­ters.</p>
    <p>Se­bas­tian, nick­named Sebi, started out with a pas­sion for ice hockey but de­cided to fo­cus on ten­nis at age nine after trav­el­ling to the US Open in 2009 with his fa­ther when Petr was coach­ing the Czech player Radek Stepanek.</p>
    <p>“He played Djokovic on Ashe at like 10.30 at night,” Se­bas­tian said of Stepanek.</p>
    <p>“It was com­pletely packed, and I thought it was the coolest thing ever. I went home and said, this is ex­actly what I want to do, just kind of fell in love with it.”</p>
    <p>The Korda par­ents taught Se­bas­tian the ten­nis fun­da­men­tals, which in­cluded a two-handed back­hand, which has de­vel­oped into his best shot and is quite a con­trast to his fa­ther’s flat one-han­der.</p>
