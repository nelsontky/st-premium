    <p>Amer­i­can Bryson DeCham­beau (right) won his maiden Ma­jor ti­tle, the US Open, on Sun­day af­ter fir­ing a three-un­der 67 fi­nal round for a six-un­der 274 to­tal at Winged Foot. The vic­tory also val­i­dated the 27-year-old’s un­ortho­dox ap­proach that has seen him pack­ing on 14kg of mus­cle to add ve­loc­ity to his drive.</p>
    <p>NEW YORK • Bryson DeCham­beau’s un­ortho­dox style got ma­jor val­i­da­tion on Sun­day, as the power-driv­ing “mad sci­en­tist” of the PGA Tour claimed the US Open by a de­fin­i­tive six-stroke mar­gin and si­lenced his scep­tics.</p>
    <p>Since he un­veiled his sin­gle­length set of clubs at the start of his pro ca­reer, the for­mer physics ma­jor has em­barked on a one-man mis­sion to rev­o­lu­tionise golf, fac­ing plenty of doubts in a sport where tra­di­tion is val­ued above all else.</p>
    <p>His most re­cent ex­per­i­ment was per­haps his most am­bi­tious yet: a phys­i­cal trans­for­ma­tion that saw the 27-year-old pack on 14kg of mus­cle with a high-calo­rie diet and hours spent at the gym dur­ing the hia­tus this year, in or­der to add jaw-drop­ping ve­loc­ity to his drive.</p>
    <p>“I all of a sud­den got a l ot stronger, worked out ev­ery day, been work­ing out ev­ery day, and all of a sud­den – not be­cause of clubs, but be­cause of me, I was able to gain 20, 25 yards,” said DeCham­beau af­ter win­ning his maiden Ma­jor ti­tle over fel­low Amer­i­can Matthew Wolff (75).</p>
    <p>He fired a three-un­der 67, Sun­day’s only sub-par round, for a six­un­der 274 to­tal at the for­mi­da­ble Winged Foot lay­out.</p>
    <p>“I kept telling ev­ery­body it’s an ad­van­tage to hit it far­ther,” he added.</p>
    <p>“As dif­fi­cult as this golf course was pre­sented, I played it beau­ti­fully.</p>
    <p>“Even through the rough, I was still able to man­age my game and hit it to cor­rect sides of the greens and kept plug­ging away.</p>
    <p>“My putting was im­mac­u­late. My speed con­trol, in­cred­i­ble. You see me out there on the greens with the de­vice try­ing to con­trol my speed. So many times I re­lied on sci­ence and it worked ev­ery sin­gle time.”</p>
    <p>Four-time Ma­jor win­ner Rory McIl­roy (75), who fin­ished tied for eighth, told re­porters he was ini­tially scep­ti­cal that DeCham­beau’s hard-charg­ing ap­proach would work in the long term, af­ter play­ing with him at Colo­nial in June.</p>
    <p>“I sort of said, okay, wait un­til he gets to a proper golf course, he’ll have to rein it back in,” he said.</p>
    <p>“This is as proper as they come, and look what’s hap­pened. Yeah, he’s got full be­lief in what he’s do­ing, and it’s pretty im­pres­sive.”</p>
    <p>Un­like some of his past ex­per­i­ments – in­clud­ing his now-banned on-course com­pass and the “sidesad­dle” putting tech­nique he tried and quickly aban­doned in 2017 – DeCham­beau said this new ap­proach was here to stay as he aims to add an­other 5kg be­fore the Masters in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>“I think I’m def­i­nitely chang­ing the way peo­ple think about the game.</p>
    <p>“There’s a lot of peo­ple that are go­ing to be hit­ting it far,” said the Amer­i­can, who also plans to try out a 1.2 me­tre driver next week. That is over 6cm on a club that is al­ready slightly above the av­er­age.</p>
    <p>His 325 yards off the tee set a record for any US Open champion even though he found only 23 of 56 fair­ways over four rounds. He also was the only player with­out an over-par round.</p>
    <p>“It’s a lot of val­i­da­tion through sci­ence,” DeCham­beau said.</p>
    <p>“It def­i­nitely is val­i­dat­ing I’m able to ex­e­cute time and time again and have it be good enough to win an Open.”</p>
    <p>Com­bat­ing him could be tough. Squeeze fair­ways thin­ner and his dis­tance be­comes a big­ger edge with more peo­ple in the deep grass. Make them wider and length is an even greater ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>An­other key area that has helped him is his skill with the put­ter.</p>
    <p>“The putting has grad­u­ally im­proved over the course of my ca­reer. I was dead last when I came out on Tour,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sci­ence again came to his res­cue. “(It) helped me un­der­stand how a ball needs to roll in or­der to give me the best chance to hole a putt.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery year I’ve got­ten a lit­tle bit bet­ter.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know how much bet­ter I can get, but I’m go­ing to keep try­ing ev­ery sin­gle week.”</p>
