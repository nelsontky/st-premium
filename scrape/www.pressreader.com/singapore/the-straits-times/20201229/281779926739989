    <p>• A man armed with a knife killed seven peo­ple and wounded seven oth­ers in north­east­ern China on Sun­day, state me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>The at­tack – which the po­lice said ap­peared to have been “random” – re­port­edly took place at 8.14am lo­cal time in the city of</p>
    <p>Kaiyuan in Liaon­ing province.</p>
    <p>The at­tacker was later ar­rested in a lo­cal bath house, they added.</p>
    <p>An in­quiry has be­gun, the Kaiyuan pub­lic se­cu­rity of­fice said in a post on the Twit­ter-like Weibo web­site.</p>
    <p>Stab­bings are rel­a­tively com­mon in China. Firearms are banned but are of­ten used in random at­tacks by an­gry cit­i­zens who see them­selves as vic­tims of in­jus­tice seek­ing re­venge on so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary last year, a man who sus­pected his wife of adul­tery stabbed eight peo­ple to death and in­jured seven in a vil­lage in the coun­try’s north-east.</p>
    <p>In April the pre­vi­ous year, a knife-wield­ing 28-year-old man killed nine col­lege stu­dents and in­jured 12 oth­ers out­side their school in the north­ern province of Shaanxi. The at­tacker later said he acted out of re­venge after be­ing ha­rassed by a stu­dent at the same school.</p>
