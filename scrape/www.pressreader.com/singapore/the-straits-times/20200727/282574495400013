    <p>Aries</p>
    <p>(March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>You are mov­ing more slowly through your tasks than you would like, but you should not rush. In­stead, make sure you are on top of your to-do list.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus</p>
    <p>(April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You are sus­pi­cious of some­one close. That is not a good place to be, but you may just have to ac­cept th­ese feel­ings for a few more days.</p>
    <p>Gem­ini</p>
    <p>(May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>If you can stand up to public opin­ion or peer pres­sure, you should do well. Peo­ple do not like you be­ing dis­agree­able, but it is for the best.</p>
    <p>Can­cer</p>
    <p>(June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Take bet­ter care of your­self and pay at­ten­tion to the peo­ple you spend time with. Try to keep to those who ex­ude pos­i­tive vibes.</p>
    <p>Leo</p>
    <p>(July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Some­one tries to get ahead at your ex­pense, but he or she is mis­guided. While things can still go wrong, he or she is not get­ting his or her way.</p>
    <p>Virgo</p>
    <p>(Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Get mov­ing and your ideas will start to flow. You can find all sorts of new ways to tackle your prob­lems.</p>
    <p>Li­bra</p>
    <p>(Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Your cash flow needs some at­ten­tion. See if you can spend less or take in more while you wait for things to get a lit­tle bit bet­ter.</p>
    <p>Scor­pio</p>
    <p>(Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Your in­ner strength is show­ing, so make sure you are ex­ploit­ing it. Your great en­ergy is perfect for push­ing past ob­sta­cles.</p>
    <p>Sagit­tar­ius</p>
    <p>(Nov 22 - Dec 21) Now is a good time for in­tro­spec­tion. Take time to be by your­self and think about who you are and what you want.</p>
    <p>Capri­corn</p>
    <p>(Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Pay at­ten­tion to what your friends are say­ing and heed their ad­vice be­cause it can make a world of dif­fer­ence to you.</p>
    <p>Aquar­ius</p>
    <p>(Jan 20 - Feb 18) Slow down and en­joy the day – you have less go­ing on than usual, so you may as well take ev­ery­thing one step at a time.</p>
    <p>Pisces</p>
    <p>(Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>You feel a bit wishy-washy, but that means you have to let oth­ers make up your mind for you or de­fer any big de­ci­sions for a few more days.</p>
