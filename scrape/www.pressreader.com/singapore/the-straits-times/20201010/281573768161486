    <p>About 1,400 fam­i­lies will be the first to live in smart-en­abled Hous­ing Board flats in Pung­gol Northshore by the end of this year. The flats are equipped with built-in fit­tings that al­low any ap­pli­ance that is con­nected to a power source to be con­trolled through a mo­bile ap­pli­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>About 1,400 fam­i­lies will be the first to live in smart-en­abled Hous­ing Board flats in Pung­gol Northshore by the end of this year.</p>
    <p>Spread across two Build-To-Or­der (BTO) projects, Northshore Res­i­dences I & II, the flats are equipped with the “brains” of a smart home – smart power sock­ets and high-tech dis­tri­bu­tion boards.</p>
    <p>These built-in fit­tings let own­ers trans­form their flats into smart homes if they want to. This means that any ap­pli­ance that is con­nected to a power source – lamp, fan or cof­fee maker – can be con­trolled through a mo­bile ap­pli­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The 1,402 units in 12 res­i­den­tial blocks are the first batch of smarten­abled BTO flats to be rolled out by the HDB. Own­ers are now col­lect­ing their keys.</p>
    <p>Pung­gol Northshore, one of seven wa­ter­front hous­ing dis­tricts in Pung­gol, will also be the first district in Sin­ga­pore to have smart fea­tures.</p>
    <p>Sen­sors will be de­ployed to an­a­lyse the per­for­mance of key es­tate ser­vices such as light­ing, wa­ter pumps, lifts and waste col­lec­tion for predictive main­te­nance.</p>
    <p>Within the es­tate, smart light­ing in com­mon ar­eas with lit­tle to no hu­man traf­fic de­tected can be dimmed au­to­mat­i­cally to 30 per cent, po­ten­tially sav­ing up to 60 per cent in en­ergy us­age.</p>
    <p>A smart ir­ri­ga­tion sys­tem with mois­ture sen­sors uses fac­tors such as rain­fall and sun­light to op­ti­mise wa­ter sched­ules and us­age. This makes for a wa­ter-ef­fi­cient and less labour-in­ten­sive ap­proach to main­tain­ing green­ery and land­scapes within the es­tate.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the HDB laid out how Pung­gol, one of the new­est towns in Sin­ga­pore, has been de­vel­oped as a smart and sus­tain­able town over the past decade.</p>
    <p>First, there was Treelodge@ Pung­gol, the coun­try’s first pub­li­c­hous­ing de­vel­op­ment with ecofriendl­y fea­tures.</p>
    <p>Com­pleted in 2010, the eco­precinct com­prises seven res­i­den­tial blocks with a podium carpark and green spa­ces at the precinct level.</p>
    <p>The guid­ing de­sign prin­ci­ple was to har­ness the el­e­ments of na­ture wher­ever pos­si­ble, such as wind, day­light, rain­fall and green­ery, to pro­mote sus­tain­able green liv­ing, said the HDB.</p>
    <p>To achieve that, the roof of the carpark was turned into an ecodeck with ex­ten­sive green­ery, in­clud­ing a com­mu­nity gar­den.</p>
    <p>To en­cour­age re­cy­cling and for con­ve­nience, a cen­tralised refuse chute for re­cy­clable ma­te­ri­als was in­cor­po­rated in each block.</p>
    <p>Treelodge@Pung­gol was also the first pub­lic-hous­ing de­vel­op­ment to have so­lar photo-voltaic pan­els on its rooftops. The en­ergy gener</p>
    <p>ated is al­most enough to power ser­vices such as lift oper­a­tions and light­ing in com­mon ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Since then, 169 blocks in Pung­gol have been fit­ted with so­lar pan­els, with an­other 300 be­ing equipped.</p>
    <p>Along the way, Pung­gol has served as a “liv­ing lab­o­ra­tory” where HDB tests new ideas and</p>
    <p>tech­nolo­gies. Fea­tures that are suc­cess­fully tri­alled will be repli­cated in up­com­ing de­vel­op­ments such as the “for­est town” of Ten­gah.</p>
    <p>So far, 30 so­lu­tions have been im­ple­mented and rolled out to the rest of Pung­gol, such as dual bi­cy­cle racks and a rain­wa­ter-har­vest­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Of these, 22 so­lu­tions have been im­ple­mented be­yond Pung­gol, such as the cen­tralised re­cy­cling chutes and en­ergy-sav­ing LED light­ing with mo­tion sen­sors.</p>
    <p>The smart fea­tures in Northshore Res­i­dences were the big­gest draw for graphic de­signer Haris Rasid, 28. He and his wife de­cided to get their first home in Pung­gol, even if that meant not liv­ing near their par­ents i n the western part of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“The es­tate comes with so many smart fea­tures and liv­ing in this cur­rent era where tech­nol­ogy is key, my wife and I thought that we would give it a try and be one of the first own­ers of a smart HDB flat,” said the father of one.</p>
    <p>Their four-room unit in Northshore Res­i­dences II is be­ing ren­o­vated and they ex­pect to move in at the end of the month.</p>
    <p>“In the be­gin­ning, I plan to use the smart fea­tures to keep track of our util­ity us­age just to get the hang of the sys­tem as it is new to us. Maybe some time in the fu­ture, we’ll look at branching out into other smart ap­pli­ances and sys­tems,” he said.</p>
