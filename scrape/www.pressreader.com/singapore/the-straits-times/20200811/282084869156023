    <p>When he found him­self at the tailend of a Na­tional Day Pa­rade (NDP) mo­bile col­umn in Wood­lands Av­enue 3 on Sun­day, Food­panda de­liv­ery rider Ab­dul Rah­man waved at on­look­ers and re­ceived loud cheers in re­turn.</p>
    <p>What many may not know is that it was one of the best birth­day gifts he ever re­ceived, the 29-year-old told The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>His birth­day was last Saturday, a day he spent work­ing as usual be­fore his wife sur­prised him with a cake when he re­turned home for lunch at 1pm.</p>
    <p>“We had a quick cel­e­bra­tion and ate lunch to­gether, and I was off to work again at 3pm.”</p>
    <p>Mr Rah­man, who has two sons aged two and four, has been a de­liv­ery rider for about a year.</p>
    <p>He now works up to nine hours a day, six days a week, to pro­vide for his fam­ily who live in a three-room Hous­ing Board flat in Wood­lands.</p>
    <p>His wife, 31, works in the en­gi­neer­ing sec­tor.</p>
    <p>“Food de­liv­ery is not an easy job. We have to travel through rain and heat, and deal with traf­fic also. I would say it is a high-risk oc­cu­pa­tion.</p>
    <p>“De­liv­ery rid­ers are part of the front lin­ers, and de­serve to be ap­pre­ci­ated. I’m very happy to see all the nice com­ments on­line.”</p>
    <p>Many on YouTube had de­scribed him as a hero. One even wrote: “Without un­sung heroes like him, I would have starved dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>A ban on din­ing-in dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker from April 7 saw de­mand for food de­liv­er­ies in­crease by about 20 to 30 per cent.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, Mr Rah­man found him­self at the tail-end of the north­ern route con­tin­gent at around noon, be­hind five mo­bile col­umn mo­tor­bikes, when he was on his way to pick up an or­der from a nearby Esso petrol sta­tion.</p>
    <p>The roads cov­ered by the five mo­bile col­umns were closed on a rolling ba­sis and re­opened to traf­fic once the col­umn passed. Mo­torists were ad­vised to avoid the routes un­til the end of the seg­ment at 1.20pm.</p>
    <p>“The other ve­hi­cles took dif­fer­ent routes to avoid the mo­bile col­umn. But pass­ing through Wood­lands Av­enue 3 was the only way for me to get to Esso.</p>
    <p>“So I just pro­ceeded on the same route as the con­tin­gent,” he said.</p>
    <p>He fol­lowed the con­tin­gent for about 10 min­utes, wav­ing to the crowd en­thu­si­as­ti­cally, a spon­ta­neous de­ci­sion pro­pelled by his easy­go­ing na­ture.</p>
    <p>“Some of the on­look­ers yelled ‘Food­panda!’. It was a very funny mo­ment,” said Mr Rah­man, who was caught in a 25-sec­ond video which has been shared widely.</p>
    <p>His four-year-old saw the video and was beam­ing with pride when he re­turned home at 8pm.</p>
    <p>“He told our neigh­bours: ‘ My daddy is in the Na­tional Day Pa­rade.’”</p>
    <p>It was not his first time, he noted. In 2011, he was part of the po­lice con­tin­gent when he was do­ing his full-time na­tional ser­vice.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, the north­ern route of the mo­bile col­umn – com­pris­ing about a dozen ve­hi­cles from the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force, Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces and Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force – trav­elled from Khatib to Sem­bawang.</p>
    <p>Front lin­ers and es­sen­tial work­ers from sec­tors such as health­care and so­cial ser­vices were aboard some of the ve­hi­cles, and res­i­dents greeted them with cheery waves.</p>
    <p>Then came Mr Rah­man, whose role in the pan­demic may have been dwarfed by the oth­ers, but who was sur­prised by the en­thu­si­as­tic cheers.</p>
    <p>But heroes, as those who watched the video and left their com­ments noted, come in all shapes and sizes. On Na­tional Day, a Food­panda de­liv­ery rider showed Sin­ga­pore­ans that ev­ery­one counts.</p>
