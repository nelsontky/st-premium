    <p>A year ago to­day, China and the United States were on the cusp of ink­ing the phase one trade deal, putting a halt to what was then an es­ca­lat­ing tar­iff war.</p>
    <p>In Bei­jing, there was cau­tious op­ti­mism that the in­terim deal could her­ald a turn­ing point in what was then a rapidly sour­ing re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>But as the in­ter­ven­ing year has shown, Covid-19 put paid to those hopes. Dis­trust has grown and di­a­logue has all but stopped. This year, both sides have shut con­sulates and ex­pelled jour­nal­ists as re­la­tions en­tered a dan­ger­ous win­ter.</p>
    <p>But one year on, the same cau­tious op­ti­mism is re­turn­ing to Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>With the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion on its way out and Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den set to take power with a fresh team come Jan 20, signs have emerged that Chi­nese lead­ers are seek­ing a re­set in Bei­jing’s re­la­tions with Wash­ing­ton, and are watch­ing Mr Bi­den’s key Cabi­net ap­point­ments closely for what changes they might au­gur.</p>
    <p>A flurry of sig­nals on China’s in­ten­tion to re­build the re­la­tion­ship has come since late last month.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping in his con­grat­u­la­tory mes­sage to Mr Bi­den on Nov 25 wrote that he hoped both sides would be able to man­age and con­trol dif­fer­ences, and fo­cus on co­op­er­a­tion to ad­vance re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>A day ear­lier, for­mer top Chi­nese diplo­mat Fu Ying wrote in a com­men­tary in The New York Times say­ing both coun­tries needed to have can­did talks to re­store trust. She sug­gested that both sides could co­op­er­ate on deal­ing with health crises and cli­mate change, and that their mil­i­taries should have talks at a “strate­gic level” – a wel­come sig­nal at a time when there is in­creas­ing talk that ten­sions could de­te­ri­o­rate into war.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing’s am­bas­sador to Wash­ing­ton Cui Tiankai tweeted ear­lier this month that dif­fer­ences be­tween both coun­tries do not jus­tify con­fronta­tion or war.</p>
    <p>Then last week, Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi made clear China’s de­sire for a re­set in a video call with board mem­bers of the US-China Busi­ness Coun­cil when he said restart­ing di­a­logue and re­build­ing trust were the most press­ing tasks at the mo­ment.</p>
    <p>“China and the US should open di­a­logue at all lev­els. Any is­sue can be brought to the ta­ble for dis­cus­sion – whether they are strate­gic, over­all or long-term is­sues, there can be com­mu­ni­ca­tion,” Mr Wang said, adding that China’s “door to di­a­logue is open at all times”.</p>
    <p>But the For­eign Min­is­ter also pointed out that in Bei­jing’s eyes, the blame for the cur­rent state of af­fairs lay squarely with Wash­ing­ton and “some peo­ple on the Amer­i­can side hold on to an out­dated Cold War men­tal­ity and ide­o­log­i­cal prej­u­dices”.</p>
    <p>READ­ING THE RUNES</p>
    <p>Now with a chang­ing of the guard, Bei­jing sees an op­por­tu­nity to sta­bilise re­la­tions af­ter the tu­mult of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>“China’s goal is very clear, what it de­sires now is to con­tin­u­ally strengthen and de­velop its econ­omy and tech­nol­ogy,” said Pro­fes­sor Zhu Feng, dean of the School of In­ter­na­tional Re­la­tions at Nan­jing Univer­sity. “If it en­ters into a new Cold War with the US, then this will not be to its ben­e­fit.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s Cabi­net ap­pointees re­spon­si­ble for shap­ing the ad­min­is­tra­tion’s China pol­icy are be­ing closely scru­ti­nised.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese ex­perts have been por­ing over the com­ments and writ­ings of Mr Antony Blinken and Mr Jake Sul­li­van, the Pres­i­dent-elect’s nom­i­nees for sec­re­tary of state and na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser re­spec­tively, to suss out their views and likely pol­icy re­sponses on China-re­lated mat­ters.</p>
    <p>Ar­ti­cles like the one Mr Sul­li­van co-wrote with for­mer as­sis­tant sec­re­tary of state Kurt Camp­bell for For­eign Af­fairs mag­a­zine, ti­tled “Com­pe­ti­tion with­out catas­tro­phe”, have been held up as ex­am­ples that Mr Bi­den’s Amer­ica would find ways to co­ex­ist with China even as the two coun­tries com­pete.</p>
    <p>As for Mr Blinken, he is a fa­mil­iar face in Chi­nese for­eign pol­icy cir­cles. He vis­ited China in 2015 and 2016 when he was deputy sec­re­tary of state, and co-hosted a bi­lat­eral se­cu­rity di­a­logue with then Chi­nese vice-for­eign min­is­ter Zhang Ye­sui dur­ing the lat­ter’s visit.</p>
    <p>Re­ports in Septem­ber that he had re­marked that it was un­re­al­is­tic and counter-pro­duc­tive for the US to “fully de­cou­ple” from China would be a re­lief to the Chi­nese look­ing for some mod­er­a­tion af­ter the Trump years.</p>
    <p>But an­a­lysts are less sure about Mr Bi­den’s choice for trade rep­re­sen­ta­tive, Demo­crat trade lawyer Kather­ine Tai.</p>
    <p>Ms Tai, who has ex­ten­sive ex­pe­ri­ence in deal­ing with China and speaks flu­ent Man­darin, taught English at a univer­sity in Guangzhou from 1996 to 1998 un­der a Yale Univer­sity fel­low­ship and was chief coun­sel for China trade en­force­ment at the Of­fice of the US Trade Rep­re­sen­ta­tive from 2011 to 2014. She has called for both an “of­fen­sive and de­fen­sive” ap­proach in trade pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Ms Tai has said the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s trade mea­sures were mostly de­fen­sive in na­ture and the US needed an of­fen­sive ap­proach by boost­ing the com­pet­i­tive­ness of its own in­dus­tries, a point that Chi­nese ex­perts have also noted.</p>
    <p>The trio have been de­scribed as “es­tab­lish­ment elites” and old hands – all were se­nior ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials dur­ing the Obama years.</p>
    <p>The con­sen­sus in Bei­jing is that the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s mer­cu­rial ap­proach to China re­la­tions will give way to a more co­or­di­nated one un­der Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>“While Mr Bi­den will likely still con­tinue the pol­icy of check­ing China’s rise, China’s hope is to still be able to com­pete while co­op­er­at­ing,” said Prof Zhu.</p>
    <p>The na­tion­al­ist Global Times, which has been with­er­ing in its crit­i­cism of cur­rent Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo, has also un­der­gone a change of tone. In a re­port last month that can­vassed the views of Chi­nese ex­perts, it said the Bi­den of­fi­cials would bring back a “ra­tio­nal and prag­matic ap­proach” to Sino-US ties.</p>
    <p>Given the cau­tiously op­ti­mistic na­ture of Bei­jing’s re­cent com­ments, it is pos­si­ble that China could send a high-level rep­re­sen­ta­tive to Wash­ing­ton soon af­ter the in­au­gu­ra­tion on</p>
    <p>Jan 20 to kick-start di­a­logue, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Li Mingjiang from the S. Ra­jarat­nam School of In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Their ap­point­ments (of Mr Blinken and Mr Sul­li­van) would have given Chi­nese lead­ers some pos­i­tiv­ity or glim­mer of hope that Sino-US re­la­tions could be shaped to­wards a more sta­ble or co­op­er­a­tive track,” he said.</p>
    <p>LIM­ITS TO BET­TER TIES</p>
    <p>Hav­ing said that, a com­plete re­set in re­la­tions will be highly un­likely.</p>
    <p>Among Amer­i­cans, dis­trust in China has grown to his­toric highs, and Chi­nese ex­perts ac­knowl­edge that Mr Bi­den’s China pol­icy will con­tinue to be dic­tated by the bi­par­ti­san po­lit­i­cal con­sen­sus on China.</p>
    <p>This would limit the in­com­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion’s space to roll back Trump-era mea­sures. Mr Bi­den has al­ready said he would not im­me­di­ately re­move trade war tar­iffs on China with­out re­view­ing the phase one trade deal and con­sult­ing al­lies.</p>
    <p>“(Rolling back Trump’s sanc­tions) will in­vite po­lit­i­cal ac­cu­sa­tions that Bi­den or his peo­ple are weak on China and it will be­come an is­sue in the midterm elec­tion in two years or in the next pres­i­den­tial elec­tion,” said Prof Li.</p>
    <p>There­fore, even if Mr Bi­den’s China team di­alled down the harsh Trump-era rhetoric, ex­pect its mem­bers to seek out al­lies as they ex­ert pres­sure on Bei­jing on is­sues from trade to hu­man rights.</p>
    <p>In the last two weeks,</p>
    <p>Mr Sul­li­van has tweeted his sup­port for Aus­tralia (cur­rently em­broiled in an ugly spat with Bei­jing) and pro-democ­racy law­mak­ers in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>As one Chi­nese ex­pert neatly sum­marised for the Global Times, he sees Mr Bi­den’s for­eign pol­icy team as an “iron fist in a vel­vet glove”.</p>
    <p>Some would say the same of Bei­jing’s re­sponse to the in­com­ing US ad­min­is­tra­tion. It is in­struc­tive that while China has said it would like to co­op­er­ate with the US on ar­eas such as cli­mate change and pan­demic pre­pared­ness, the red lines re­main on is­sues re­lated to Hong Kong, Xin­jiang or Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>In Prof Zhu’s view, Bei­jing’s goal is to keep re­la­tions from de­te­ri­o­rat­ing fur­ther so it can con­tinue to build its strength.</p>
    <p>Longer-term ob­jec­tives aside, there are signs that Bei­jing is al­ready mov­ing tac­ti­cally to counter Wash­ing­ton’s ef­forts to court other coun­tries in or­der to forge a multi­na­tional front against China.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, China’s For­eign Min­is­ter, Mr Wang, vis­ited Ja­pan and South Korea late last month to dis­cuss co­op­er­a­tion over Covid-19 and trade. Ex­perts have said the visit could also lay the ground­work for a tri­lat­eral sum­mit.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi has also been busy phon­ing Euro­pean lead­ers such as Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel and French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron – where he stressed the need to main­tain close com­mu­ni­ca­tion and co­op­er­a­tion be­tween China and the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>With Asean, Bei­jing re­cently inked the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship trade pact, and has also been of­fer­ing Chi­nese Covid-19 vac­cines as part of its diplo­matic push.</p>
    <p>Prom­i­nent Chi­nese for­eign pol­icy scholar Shi Yin­hong has also sug­gested that Bei­jing should pur­sue a pol­icy of what he called “strate­gic and mil­i­tary re­trench­ment”, es­pe­cially in ar­eas such as the South China Sea, Tai­wan and in arms com­pe­ti­tion, by tem­po­rar­ily re­duc­ing the scope and range of mil­i­tary ac­tiv­i­ties in these ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Prof Shi, who is di­rec­tor of the Cen­tre on Amer­i­can Stud­ies at Ren­min Univer­sity in Bei­jing and an ad­viser to the Chi­nese Cabi­net, wrote in a Chi­nese se­cu­rity stud­ies jour­nal re­cently that China could use this re­trench­ment to cre­ate a con­ducive en­vi­ron­ment for talks and as a bar­gain­ing chip with the new US ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>“This re­trench­ment would serve as the ba­sic ne­go­ti­at­ing con­di­tion for the new US ad­min­is­tra­tion to make a cor­re­spond­ing re­trench­ment at some point in time, in or­der to mit­i­gate the risk of a col­li­sion on the US-China strate­gic fron­tier, pro­mote new strate­gic sta­bil­ity be­tween China and the US and seek to di­vide the US po­lit­i­cal es­tab­lish­ment’s at­ti­tude to­wards China,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>Not all of China’s tac­ti­cal ef­forts to nip in the bud a US al­liance are vel­veteen soft. Aus­tralia cer­tainly has felt its hard edge. Aus­tralia, fre­quently de­scribed by China’s state me­dia as Amer­ica’s “lap­dog”, has in re­cent months been sub­jected to Chi­nese curbs on its key ex­ports such as wine and coal, not to men­tion a con­tro­ver­sial tweet by com­bat­ive Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian.</p>
    <p>The hard-pres­sure tac­tics are widely seen as a warn­ing to other coun­tries against be­ing too en­thu­si­as­tic in sup­port­ing Amer­ica in its con­test with</p>
    <p>China.</p>
    <p>But Chi­nese lead­ers face a del­i­cate bal­anc­ing act in this car­rot and stick ap­proach – us­ing the stick too hard to bend oth­ers to its will will likely in­crease anx­i­eties over the rise of China, and en­cour­age some na­tions to avoid be­ing trapped in a de­pen­dent re­la­tion­ship with China. The US stands to gain from this fear, and so will the anti-China hawks in Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>Like the north­ern win­ter that is only now be­gin­ning to bite in Bei­jing, a bit­ter cold has de­scended on Bei­jing’s ties with Wash­ing­ton, and if Chi­nese lead­ers hope to usher in a new spring come Jan 20, ad­dress­ing this un­ease would be a good place to start.</p>
