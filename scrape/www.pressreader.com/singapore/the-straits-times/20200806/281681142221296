    <p>The 12 re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions that will have more con­gre­gants for prayers were cho­sen af­ter con­sult­ing faith lead­ers and they re­flect the re­li­gious di­ver­sity here, said the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth (MCCY) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A min­istry spokesman told The Straits Times it will be work­ing with other or­gan­i­sa­tions who want to in­crease the num­ber of con­gre­gants. He also said that more may be al­lowed to do so.</p>
    <p>The min­istry’s ex­pla­na­tion was in re­sponse to re­ports that some re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions had com­plained about be­ing left out.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, the Gov­ern­ment said that as a pi­lot test, 12 places of re­li­gious wor­ship, com­pris­ing mosques, Hindu tem­ples, churches, a Bud­dhist tem­ple and a</p>
    <p>Sikh gur­d­wara, will be al­lowed to hold gath­er­ings of up to 100 peo­ple – dou­ble the num­ber they are now al­lowed to host at any one time.</p>
    <p>The fol­low­ing day, evening daily Shin Min Daily News re­ported that some Taoist groups were un­happy they were not cho­sen, and more than 20 tem­ples had made com­plaints to the Taoist Fed­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>In its re­sponse, the min­istry said re­li­gious l ead­ers, who are also mem­bers of the Na­tional Steer­ing Com­mit­tee (NSC) on Racial and Re­li­gious Har­mony, were con­sulted be­fore the list of 12 was drawn up. Mem­bers of the NSC in­clude the Catholic Arch­dio­cese of Sin­ga­pore, Hindu Ad­vi­sory Board, Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore, the Na­tional Coun­cil of Churches Sin­ga­pore, the Sikh Ad­vi­sory Board and the Taoist Fed­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­i­sa­tions cho­sen were also found to have proven they could conduct ser­vices for up to 50 per­sons with safe man­age­ment prac­tices in place. These in­clude re­quir­ing con­gre­gants to wear a face mask at all times, and not al­low­ing singing and live per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, the min­istry said the 12 places would have to ob­serve new safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, such as the use of two sep­a­rate zones of up to 50 peo­ple each.</p>
    <p>MCCY said that the num­ber of re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions (ROs) al­lowed to host more con­gre­gants may in­crease, “as ROs and the com­mu­nity gain con­fi­dence” in the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the safety mea­sures.</p>
