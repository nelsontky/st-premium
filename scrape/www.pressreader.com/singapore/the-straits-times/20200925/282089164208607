    <p>At 23, Mr Mock Yi Jun is among young Sin­ga­pore­ans that his gen­er­a­tion calls “woke”.</p>
    <p>“Woke” means be­ing acutely aware of so­cial is­sues — and act­ing on such aware­ness. Where oth­ers merely worry about a pan­demic-stricken econ­omy, cli­mate change and po­lit­i­cal upheaval, the “woke” pre­fer to walk as much as talk, to do what oth­ers don’t or won’t.</p>
    <p>Con­fronting the chal­lenges of this gen­er­a­tion, Mr Mock and his Sin­ga­porean peers are us­ing their voice, tal­ents and skills to be the new nor­mal’s agents of change.</p>
    <p>Mr Mock leads a 51-strong team who are help­ing youth make in­formed de­ci­sions about their ca­reer and fu­ture ed­u­ca­tion choices. He is do­ing this through Ad­vi­sory (ad­vi­sory.sg), a non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion that of­fers re­sources such as an on­line ca­reer guid­ance por­tal.</p>
    <p>He shares that his pre­vi­ous in­tern­ships with gov­ern­ment agen­cies helped to land him a for­eign ser­vice schol­ar­ship and zero in on his oc­cu­pa­tion of choice, in­spir­ing him to set up Ad­vi­sory for young job seek­ers.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­i­sa­tion’s ca­reer guid­ance por­tal pub­lishes in-depth in­ter­views with in­dus­try ex­perts that pro­vide an inside look at spe­cific pro­fes­sions, with per­sonal ac­counts of job ex­pe­ri­ences and de­tails of work tasks and en­vi­ron­ments.</p>
    <p>The in­ter­views can be read for free on Ad­vi­sory ’s web­site.</p>
    <p>In April, the or­gan­i­sa­tion launched an on­line men­tor­ship pro­gramme that pairs students with work­ing pro­fes­sion­als for three months. The men­tors pro­vide ad­vice and guid­ance on is­sues such as ca­reer in­ter­ests and fu­ture ed­u­ca­tion choices.</p>
    <p>Mr Mock shares that of the pro­gramme’s 1,943 ap­pli­cants, aged be­tween 16 and 28, al­most 700 have been matched with a men­tor so far.</p>
    <p>He feels the Covid-19 pan­demic has un­der­scored the im­por­tance of sup­port­ing youth seek­ing ca­reer-re­lated op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Is­sues on jobs and the fu­ture of work are among the top con­cerns that youth have voiced on var­i­ous plat­forms.</p>
    <p>To ad­dress these con­cerns, the Na­tional Youth Coun­cil (NYC) and Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth (MCCY) have rolled out a slew of ini­tia­tives to en­gage and strengthen the youth voice in shap­ing Sin­ga­pore’s fu­ture.</p>
    <p>NYC, for in­stance, has fa­cil­i­tated dis­cus­sions and ac­tiv­i­ties and pro­vided re­sources that sup­port youth ad­vo­cacy and ac­tion.</p>
    <p>They are part of ef­forts to en­cour­age youth to part­ner the Gov­ern­ment in the pol­icy-mak­ing process and come up with solutions to so­ci­etal is­sues on a reg­u­lar ba­sis.</p>
    <p>To seek youth in­put on new and ex­ist­ing poli­cies, NYC also con­ducts pol­icy-based en­gage­ments.</p>
    <p>One key en­gage­ment ef­fort is a new se­ries of di­a­logues, known as the Emerg­ing Stronger Con­ver­sa­tions (ESC), that pro­vides a plat­form for Sin­ga­pore­ans to re­flect on their ex­pe­ri­ences dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic and share their hopes for a post-pan­demic Sin­ga­pore. NYC is or­gan­is­ing seven of these ses­sions for youth.</p>
    <p>Based on re­cent di­a­logues, some key con­cerns of the youth in­clude:</p>
    <p>Hav­ing a greater stake in shap­ing a more in­clu­sive Sin­ga­pore;</p>
    <p>Cre­at­ing a cul­ture for youth to feel safe in seek­ing help for men­tal well-be­ing is­sues; Pro­vid­ing more emo­tional sup­port for vul­ner­a­ble com­mu­ni­ties be­yond struc­tured sup­port sys­tems;</p>
    <p>Pri­ori­tis­ing en­vi­ron­men­tal and sus­tain­abil­ity is­sues such as cli­mate change and waste re­duc­tion habits even dur­ing a pan­demic, and Be­ing com­pet­i­tive and stay­ing rel­e­vant in the job mar­ket</p>
    <p>Mr Mock par­tic­i­pated in one such ses­sion and had four key take­aways:</p>
    <p>A need for more fo­cused ca­reer men­tor­ship pro­grammes;</p>
    <p>A grow­ing anx­i­ety over job prospects among grad­u­at­ing students;</p>
    <p>A high de­mand for up­skilling and reskilling op­por­tu­ni­ties, and</p>
    <p>A need to build a more re­silient econ­omy that can with­stand fu­ture shocks</p>
    <p>Mov­ing for­ward, he hopes to in­tro­duce more ini­tia­tives through his or­gan­i­sa­tion to help the young in those spe­cific ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Sup­port from NYC has been crit­i­cal in Ad­vi­sory ’s ef­forts so far.</p>
    <p>Last July, Ad­vi­sory emerged as the winner in the in­au­gu­ral Youth Ac­tion Chal­lenge (YAC) Sum­mit, or­gan­ised by NYC, MCCY and the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion Youth Move­ment.</p>
    <p>The chal­lenge en­cour­ages youth to gen­er­ate pol­icy ideas and ground-up ini­tia­tives to solve so­ci­etal is­sues in part­ner­ship with the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“As an or­gan­i­sa­tion, the im­pe­tus to un­der­stand how we could do even more for schools and students than we al­ready have, drove our de­ci­sion to take part in the Youth Ac­tion Chal­lenge,” ex­plains Mr Mock, who is cur­rently serv­ing Na­tional Ser­vice.</p>
    <p>As win­ners, Ad­vi­sory re­ceived a $50,000 grant that will be used to roll out new ini­tia­tives such as the Ad­vi­sory Schools Pro­gramme. To be launched next year, the pro­gramme will pro­vide ed­u­ca­tion and ca­reer guid­ance to over 44,000 tertiary students.</p>
