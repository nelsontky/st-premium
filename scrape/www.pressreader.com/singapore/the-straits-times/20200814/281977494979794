    <p>De­mand is high for the Hous­ing Board’s (HDB) lat­est Build-To-Or­der (BTO) ex­er­cise, with flats in both ma­ture and non-ma­ture es­tates in Gey­lang and Wood­lands heav­ily over­sub­scribed yesterday, just one day into their one-week launch for sale.</p>
    <p>As of yesterday evening, there were on av­er­age more than two ap­pli­cants for each of the 7,862 flats avail­able at this sales ex­er­cise, even after HDB said some of the flats in this launch may take up to five years to build due to con­struc­tion safety mea­sures in­tro­duced since Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Among t he most in-de­mand units were larger flats in ma­ture es­tates. There were 2,400 ap­pli­cants for 334 four-room flats i n the Dakota One pro­ject in Gey­lang, while 1,180 ap­pli­ca­tions were re­ceived for 140 five-room flats in Ang Mo Kio’s Ke­bun Baru Edge.</p>
    <p>The Dakota One flats are walk­ing dis­tance from Dakota MRT sta­tion and the Old Air­port Road Food Cen­tre. The Ke­bun Baru Edge pro­ject is lo­cated on a site near Bis­han-Ang Mo Kio Park.</p>
    <p>Also pop­u­lar were five-room flats in Ur­banVille @ Wood­lands,</p>
    <p>Num­ber of ap­pli­cants for the 334 four-room flats in the Dakota One pro­ject in Gey­lang, which is among those that saw the most de­mand. which had 1,838 ap­pli­cants vy­ing for 438 units in the non-ma­ture es­tate. Sim­i­larly, there were 1,024 ap­pli­ca­tions for the 325 five-room flats in Costa Grove in Pasir Ris.</p>
    <p>The Wood­lands de­vel­op­ment, a five-minute walk from Wood­lands MRT sta­tion, is slated to be com­pleted in the sec­ond quar­ter of 2026, while the one in Pasir Ris is es­ti­mated to be com­pleted in end-2025.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, 652 ap­pli­cants are vy­ing for 272 four-room flats in Bis­han Tow­ers – the first time in 14 years that new units are be­ing built in the ma­ture es­tate.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 11 hous­ing projects were launched for sale, in­clud­ing flats spread across the ma­ture town of Tampines as well as the non-ma­ture towns of Choa Chu Kang and Ten­gah.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­ca­tions for these flats close on Aug 18. The flats will be al­lo­cated through bal­lot­ing.</p>
    <p>Some of the projects were orig­i­nally slated to be launched in May but were post­poned due to the ex­ten­sion of the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>There is no Sale of Bal­ance Flats ex­er­cise this round.</p>
    <p>The sales ex­er­cise is the sec­ond BTO launch of the year, fol­low­ing Fe­bru­ary’s sales ex­er­cise where big­ger flats in Sem­bawang and Toa Payoh were heav­ily over­sub­scribed by 10 and seven times re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>In Novem­ber, HDB will of­fer about 5,700 flats in Bis­han, Sem­bawang, Tampines, Ten­gah and Toa Payoh.</p>
    <p>An­other 3,550 flats in Bukit Ba­tok, Ten­gah, Kal­lang/Wham­poa and Toa Payoh (Bi­dadari) will be launched in Fe­bru­ary next year.</p>
