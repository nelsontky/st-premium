    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Ex­change Reg­u­la­tion (SGX RegCo) has said in­ves­ti­ga­tions should be un­der­taken, where nec­es­sary, into the suit­abil­ity of pro­fes­sional ad­vi­sory ser­vices firm Ax­ing­ton’s board of di­rec­tors.</p>
    <p>Ax­ing­ton’s board in­cludes Ms Evan­ge­line Shen of Bel­la­graph Nova (BN) Group, which is making a bid for English Premier League club New­cas­tle United.</p>
    <p>Ms Shen, 32, who is also known as Shen Che, is a Chi­nese jew­ellery mer­chant and busi­ness part­ner of Sin­ga­porean in­vestors Nel­son Loh, 40, and Ter­ence Loh, 42.</p>
    <p>She is the non-in­de­pen­dent nonex­ec­u­tive chair­man of Ax­ing­ton, a Catal­ist-listed com­pany in Sin­ga­pore. The Lohs, who are cousins, are con­trol­ling share­hold­ers of Ax­ing­ton fol­low­ing a buyout of the com­pany last month.</p>
    <p>The Lohs and Ms Shen are also co-founders of the BN Group, which made the news with its re­cent New­cas­tle bid.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, the BN Group ad­mit­ted that it had doc­tored pub­lic­ity photos of its co-founders taken with for­mer United States pres­i­dent Barack Obama.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to me­dia queries yes­ter­day, the SGX RegCo noted that the Lohs are not di­rec­tors of Ax­ing­ton, and that Ms Shen is.</p>
    <p>The SGX RegCo said that in gen­eral, all di­rec­tors ap­pointed to the board of Catal­ist-listed com­pa­nies are re­quired to be as­sessed by the com­pany’s nom­i­nat­ing com­mit­tee and con­tin­u­ing spon­sor to be suit­able to sit on the board.</p>
    <p>This should take into ac­count “their ex­pe­ri­ence, ex­per­tise, char­ac­ter and in­tegrity”, it said.</p>
    <p>“Where nec­es­sary, ap­pro­pri­ate in­ves­ti­ga­tions should be un­der­taken to eval­u­ate suit­abil­ity in the light of re­cent de­vel­op­ments.”</p>
    <p>The state­ment said the SGX RegCo has en­gaged Ax­ing­ton’s con­tin­u­ing spon­sor, Novus Cor­po­rate Fi­nance, on its obli­ga­tions un­der Catal­ist rules.</p>
    <p>The SGX RegCo added that it ex­pects a re­sponse soon from the spon­sor.</p>
    <p>Shares of Ax­ing­ton closed lower yes­ter­day af­ter fall­ing as much as 22 per cent in ear­lier trad­ing.</p>
    <p>The stock plunged within min­utes of yes­ter­day’s open­ing bell but re­cov­ered some ground in the late af­ter­noon, to close down 2.22 per cent at 22 cents. Trad­ing vol­ume was thin, with only 486,000 shares worth $90,000 chang­ing hands.</p>
    <p>Ax­ing­ton jumped to a year-high of 26.5 cents last Wed­nes­day, two days af­ter the BN Group said it had held talks with New­cas­tle United.</p>
    <p>At the week­end, Reuters re­ported that BN Group spokesman Nerei­des An­to­nio Gi­a­mundo de Bour­bon ad­mit­ted the com­pany had al­tered photos of Mr Obama to make them look as though he had at­tended a meet­ing with its ex­ec­u­tives in Paris.</p>
    <p>In re­al­ity, the photos of Mr Obama and the BN Group co­founders were taken at a char­ity gala event in Sin­ga­pore last De­cem­ber. This was spon­sored by Novena Global Life­care, which was founded in 2010 by the Loh cousins.</p>
    <p>The BN Group was formed in July af­ter a merger be­tween the Dorr Group founded by the Loh cousins and Ms Shen’s Bel­la­graph Group.</p>
    <p>The Lohs and Ms Shen are also in­volved in Ax­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>For­merly known as Ax­ce­la­sia, Ax­ing­ton pro­vided ad­vi­sory ser­vices, such as in­ter­nal au­dit and qual­ity as­sur­ance re­view, as well as strat­egy and risk ad­vi­sory. In April this year, Ax­ing­ton sold this busi­ness to the Tri­cor Group in Hong Kong, and Ax­ce­la­sia was re­named Ax­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>The cousins in June made a manda­tory un­con­di­tional cash of­fer for all of Ax­ing­ton’s shares through their com­pany Dorr Global Health­care. The buyout closed on July 13 with Dorr hold­ing a 92.5 per cent stake in Ax­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>Ax­ing­ton on July 29 pro­posed a sec­ond name change to NETX, as well as to change its core busi­ness to pro­vid­ing med­i­cal and con­sumer well­ness ser­vices, and in­vest­ments in med­i­cal tech­nol­ogy, robotics and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>To that end, Ax­ing­ton also pro­posed to ac­quire Malaysian med­i­cal equip­ment and med­i­cal aes­thet­ics prod­ucts dis­trib­u­tor Vesta Apex Trad­ing for $12 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>This com­prises a cash con­sid­er­a­tion of $6 mil­lion and the is­suance of around 33.3 mil­lion Ax­ing­ton shares at 18 Sin­ga­pore cents a share.</p>
    <p>It cited Vesta Apex’s “at­trac­tive” busi­ness model in the med­i­cal tech sec­tor in South-east Asia, and “strong” or­der book in its med­i­cal equip­ment dis­tri­bu­tion busi­ness.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day at an ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ing, the com­pany will seek share­hold­ers’ ap­proval on four pro­posed res­o­lu­tions, in­clud­ing its name change and change in core busi­ness.</p>
