    <p>Yup, I wanted a grand re­buke, too. I wanted Don­ald Trump de­mol­ished by 10 points. But elec­tions are ed­u­ca­tional events. Vot­ers are not al­ways wise, but they are usu­ally com­pre­hen­si­ble.</p>
    <p>They know more about their own lives than pun­dits in in­for­ma­tion bub­bles do, and they al­most al­ways tell us some­thing im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>The first thing we heard from most Amer­i­cans is that Mr Trump is un­ac­cept­able.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­cans live in a di­vided, dug-in na­tion, but mil­lions more white evan­gel­i­cals voted</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic in this elec­tion than in 2016. Many peo­ple voted against par­ti­san predilec­tions to re­move a man who is a unique menace to the foun­da­tions of this coun­try. That is no mea­gre ac­com­plish­ment.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond thing vot­ers told us is this: Sep­a­rate church and state. We’ve long had po­lit­i­cal po­lar­i­sa­tion in this coun­try and we still will. But over the past few years, po­lar­i­sa­tion has trans­mo­gri­fied into some­thing worse: a re­li­gious war.</p>
    <p>Trump­ism and wokeism are not equiv­a­lent phe­nom­ena, but they both serve as sec­u­lar re­li­gions for their dis­ci­ples. They of­fer a bi­nary logic of good and evil, a cult-like mem­ber­ship ex­pe­ri­ence, apoc­a­lyp­tic or utopian vi­sions, witch tri­als for the ex­com­mu­ni­ca­tion of the im­pure and the sense of per­sonal mean­ing that comes while fight­ing a holy war.</p>
    <p>In dif­fer­ent ways, vot­ers told the two par­ties that they’d like pol­i­tics to be about prac­ti­cal is­sues. If you want a re­li­gious war, go have it some­where else.</p>
    <p>They told Repub­li­cans, for ex­am­ple, that you will be much stronger with­out the Maga crazi­ness. The Repub­li­can Party had a much bet­ter elec­tion than Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>While Mr Trump lost, Repub­li­cans have picked up more House seats. The Democrats have yet to flip a sin­gle state leg­is­la­ture, mean­ing Repub­li­cans will draw the district lines for the next 10 years of elec­tion­eer­ing.</p>
    <p>The im­age of a pos­si­ble fu­ture GOP emerged – a mul­tira­cial work­ing-class party. Repub­li­cans also made sur­pris­ing gains among Lati­nos, African Amer­i­cans and Mus­lims.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump won the largest share of the non-white vote of any Repub­li­can can­di­date in 60 years. That wasn’t done by Trumpian race-bait­ing but be­cause of the party’s rep­u­ta­tion for cham­pi­oning per­sonal agency and per­sonal re­spon­si­bil­ity, and for boost­ing small busi­nesses and eco­nomic growth. That can be built on.</p>
    <p>MES­SAGE TO DEMOCRATS</p>
    <p>Mean­while, vot­ers told Democrats that they, too, would ben­e­fit if they played up pol­icy and played down cul­tural con­cerns of their Port­landia/grad­u­ate-schooled/ de­fund-the-po­lice wing.</p>
    <p>If there was ever go­ing to be a Demo­cratic blowout elec­tion, this was it – against an im­moral can­di­date with a crim­i­nally in­com­pe­tent record. But Democrats failed to pull it off.</p>
    <p>It’s not poli­cies that cost Democrats. The core Bi­den poli­cies are as­tound­ingly pop­u­lar. It’s that they’ve built a cul­tural blue wall that keeps the other half of the coun­try out, no mat­ter the cir­cum­stance.</p>
    <p>They’ve done it by telling a cer­tain sort of story. Amer­i­can pol­i­tics, pro­gres­sives com­monly say, is all about the his­tor­i­cal shift from ho­mo­gene­ity to di­ver­sity. They see the United States as di­vided be­tween those en­light­ened cos­mopoli­tans (Democrats) who wel­come the com­ing di­verse post-in­dus­trial world and those knuckle-drag­ging, racist troglodyte­s (Repub­li­cans) who don’t.</p>
    <p>The first prob­lem with this nar­ra­tive is that it is per­pet­u­ally sur­prised by events. Elec­tion af­ter elec­tion, the emerg­ing Demo­cratic ma­jor­ity fails to emerge.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond prob­lem is that it over­sim­pli­fies the dif­fer­ent pro­cesses go­ing on in Amer­ica. Some­how, we have to have the ra­cial reck­on­ing, which is es­sen­tial, while we un­der­stand the other mega-nar­ra­tives peo­ple feel are driv­ing their lives.</p>
    <p>Third, it’s just as­ton­ish­ingly smug, self-con­grat­u­la­tory and off-putting.</p>
    <p>The vot­ers have handed Amer­ica a po­lit­i­cal sys­tem that will be led, prob­a­bly, by Mr Joe Bi­den, Ms Nancy Pelosi and Mr Mitch McConnell. Th­ese are not cul­ture war­riors. They are politi­cians and leg­is­la­tors.</p>
    <p>We now have two par­ties whose best ver­sion of them­selves is as work­ing-class par­ties.</p>
    <p>Maybe the next few years can be a par­ti­san com­pe­ti­tion over who is best for Amer­i­cans with­out col­lege de­grees.</p>
    <p>Would di­vided gov­ern­ment de­volve into grid­lock? Maybe. Mr McConnell will do what­ever is in Repub­li­cans’ best in­ter­ests in 2022. But I’m not so sure.</p>
    <p>Amer­ica is bit­terly di­vided on cul­tural mat­ters, but it is get­ting less di­vided over eco­nomic pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Pop­ulism has weak­ened the GOP’s anti-gov­ern­ment wing and opened sen­a­tors like Marco Ru­bio, Josh Haw­ley, Tom Cot­ton and oth­ers to ideas that call for more fed­eral in­volve­ment in in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>For some, that in­cludes worker train­ing, for oth­ers, an in­fra­struc­ture bank, wage sub­si­dies or R&D in­dus­trial pol­icy.</p>
    <p>The vot­ers re­minded us yet again that the other side is not go­ing away. We have to dis­pense with the fan­tasy that af­ter the next mir­a­cle elec­tion our side will sud­denly get ev­ery­thing it wants.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­cans have to live with one an­other. The key is loos­en­ing the grip the cul­ture war has had on its pol­i­tics and gov­er­nance.</p>
    <p>Let’s fight Amer­ica’s moral dif­fer­ence with books, ser­mons, movies and marches, not with po­lit­i­cal co­er­cion.</p>
