    <p>In the dark­ness of a warm May evening, five pi­rates climbed aboard the bulk car­rier Vega Aquarius that was sail­ing through the Sin­ga­pore Strait en route to China.</p>
    <p>Armed with knives, they ac­costed a sailor, re­lieved him of his cell­phone, and left him with a mi­nor head in­jury be­fore flee­ing.</p>
    <p>At the start of last month, two per­pe­tra­tors with knives boarded a ship in the same wa­ter­way. But this time, they got away with noth­ing and no crew mem­bers were harmed.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has not de­terred pi­rates in re­gional wa­ters – if any­thing, it has given them more rea­sons to carry out at­tacks on ves­sels.</p>
    <p>Piracy cases have surged again this year in the Sin­ga­pore Strait, the key wa­ter­way south of the Repub­lic – al­ready top­ping the four-year high last year de­spite the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>This is due to in­creased eco­nomic hard­ship, as well as pi­rates cap­i­tal­is­ing on fa­tigue at sea as many sea­far­ers are work­ing past usual con­tract terms, along­side other fac­tors, ex­perts told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>SIT­U­A­TION RE­PORT</p>
    <p>As at Nov 20, there were al­ready 33 piracy cases, sur­pass­ing the 31 re­ported for the whole of last year.</p>
    <p>This prompted the Re­gional Co­op­er­a­tion Agree­ment on Com­bat­ing Piracy and Armed Rob­bery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP) In­for­ma­tion Shar­ing Cen­tre (ISC) to re­lease a spe­cial re­port on this “sit­u­a­tion of con­cern”. While the num­ber of in­ci­dents has risen, they are mostly op­por­tunis­tic in na­ture.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sci­ences mar­itime econ­o­mist Yap Wei Yim noted that most of the in­ci­dents this year were at the Cat 4 level, with per­pe­tra­tors un­armed and crew mem­bers un­harmed.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, many of the in­ci­dents last year had in­volved theft by armed at­tack­ers that left ship crew in­jured, he noted.</p>
    <p>ReCAAP ISC ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Masa­fumi Kuroki agreed, and de­scribed the at­tacks as hit-and-run, with per­pe­tra­tors es­cap­ing once sighted by crew. This in­di­cates the re­cent at­tacks were quick hits, rather than the prod­uct of so­phis­ti­cated plan­ning.</p>
    <p>SE­CU­RITY GAPS</p>
    <p>Why has the spec­tre of piracy re­turned to the Sin­ga­pore Strait af­ter cases ap­peared to be con­tained just a few years ago?</p>
    <p>Mar­itime ex­perts point to a re­de­ploy­ment of naval as­sets away from the Strait – a cru­cial change as the se­cu­rity of the wa­ter­way re­lies on the vig­i­lance and en­force­ment of the au­thor­i­ties of all three lit­toral states – Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia and In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>ReCAAP data shows an in­crease in piracy in­ci­dents in the east­bound lane of the traf­fic sep­a­ra­tion scheme this year – the area north of Batam and Bin­tan.</p>
    <p>“As far as I am aware, all piracy cases that have been re­ported in 2020 took place in wa­ters that are un­der the ju­ris­dic­tion of In­done­sia,” said Mr Ridzwan Rah­mat, prin­ci­pal de­fence an­a­lyst at IHS Jane’s.</p>
    <p>He noted that the In­done­sian Navy com­mand that over­sees mar­itime se­cu­rity in the Sin­ga­pore Strait, Ar­mada I, is also over­see­ing se­cu­rity in the Natuna Is­lands clus­ter in the South China Sea, where In­done­sia is locked in a ter­ri­to­rial spat with China and Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>“I would imag­ine Ar­mada I to be par­tic­u­larly stretched in terms of as­sets, hav­ing re­quire­ments both in the South China Sea and the Sin­ga­pore Strait, and this may par­tially ex­plain why piracy con­tin­ues to be a me­nace,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing Covid-19, se­cu­rity agen­cies may have also pri­ori­tised man­power for land-based needs, said Dr Bil­veer Singh from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s political sci­ence depart­ment. In ef­fect, this cre­ates “a se­cu­rity vac­uum in the seas which makes for easy acts of piracy”, he added.</p>
    <p>DEEPER HARD­SHIP</p>
    <p>Cou­ple re­duced en­force­ment with greater poverty in fish­ing com­mu­ni­ties as lock­downs hit fish trans­porta­tion and de­mand, and it is not hard to see why more have turned to crime, said Pro­fes­sor of</p>
    <p>Se­cu­rity Stud­ies Ro­han Gu­naratna of the S. Ra­jarat­nam School of In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies.</p>
    <p>Op­por­tunis­tic at­tacks have also risen given the on­go­ing crew change cri­sis, where ship crew face dif­fi­culty ro­tat­ing home ow­ing to coun­tries’ Covid-19 re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>In­creased men­tal and phys­i­cal fa­tigue is likely af­fect­ing sea­far­ers’ vig­i­lance, said Bow­er­groupa­sia Sin­ga­pore man­ag­ing di­rec­tor James Carouso.</p>
    <p>The slow­down in port op­er­a­tions due to Covid-19 re­stric­tions also means ves­sels wait longer in an­chor­age ar­eas, leav­ing them vul­ner­a­ble to at­tacks, said Prof Gu­naratna.</p>
    <p>DE­TER­RENCE NEEDED</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said tack­ling piracy is largely a land-based op­er­a­tion, as the ma­jor­ity of pi­rates’ in­fra­struc­ture and net­works is on land. While the three lit­toral states have col­lab­o­rated pa­trols cov­er­ing their re­spec­tive ter­ri­to­rial wa­ters, th­ese ef­forts are for naught if they do not re­sult in ar­rests, which send a strong de­ter­rent mes­sage.</p>
    <p>ReCAAP noted that no fur­ther in­ci­dents in­volv­ing larger ships took place in the west­ern sec­tor fol­low­ing the March ar­rest and prose­cu­tion of three at­tack­ers who had boarded a bulk car­rier in the Sin­ga­pore Strait. How­ever, in­ci­dents con­tinue to oc­cur in the east­ern sec­tor of the east­bound lane, it said.</p>
    <p>“We urge the lit­toral states to take se­ri­ously petty theft and sea rob­bery be­cause the lack of ar­rest may em­bolden crim­i­nals to es­ca­late their acts,” said Mr Kuroki.</p>
    <p>The lack of a “hot pur­suit” ar­range­ment, al­low­ing each coun­try’s forces to chase a sus­pect craft across ter­ri­to­rial lines, is the “Achilles heel of re­gional mar­itime en­force­ment”, said Mr Ridzwan.</p>
    <p>While a Po­lice Coast Guard ves­sel here can chase af­ter a pi­rate boat, it has to stop once it reaches the In­done­sian line of con­trol, he noted.</p>
    <p>The three coun­tries had taken steps to es­tab­lish such ar­range­ments be­fore, but this was halted ow­ing to the lack of con­sen­sus over is­sues like how far the pur­suit can go and who should be the ar­rest­ing author­ity. “Th­ese can be po­lit­i­cally sen­si­tive and may en­croach into sovereignt­y is­sues,” said Mr Ridzwan.</p>
    <p>MOD­ELS TO EM­U­LATE</p>
    <p>Short of this ar­range­ment, a prac­ti­cal step to stop armed rob­bery at sea is to have strong law en­force­ment at the coast­lines.</p>
    <p>Prof Gu­naratna cited the ex­am­ple of Sri Lanka, which has not seen a sin­gle piracy or armed rob­bery in­ci­dent off its coast.</p>
    <p>All its coastal towns have a po­lice sta­tion ev­ery 5km along the west­ern and south­ern coast­lines, he noted. Har­bours also have Fish­eries Depart­ment of­fi­cials sta­tioned there, and the Sri Lanka navy and coast guard pa­trol ar­eas close to shore.</p>
    <p>The multi­na­tional counter-piracy task force in the Gulf of Aden, Com­bined Task Force (CTF) 151, is also a model worth em­u­lat­ing, said Mr</p>
    <p>Ridzwan.</p>
    <p>In CTF 151, ves­sels from each of the coun­tries’ naval or coast guard ser­vices form a unit un­der the com­mand of an elected leader, typ­i­cally from among the mem­ber states. But political fac­tors might pre­vent re­gional coun­tries from de­cid­ing on such an ar­range­ment, he said. “It is un­likely that the Royal Malaysian Navy will ever de­ploy its ves­sel un­der the di­rec­tion of a Sin­ga­porean or In­done­sian com­man­der, and vice versa.</p>
    <p>“As long as th­ese sen­si­tiv­i­ties per­sist, piracy will be here to stay.”</p>
