    <p>BRUS­SELS • Lead­ers in Europe have in­ten­si­fied ef­forts to slow coro­n­avirus con­ta­gion rates, re­viv­ing lock­downs in some ar­eas as piece­meal curbs have made lit­tle im­pact on a disease that has in­fected 4.9 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>New cases in Ger­many and Bul­garia hit a record high, and Hun­gary and Ukraine re­ported their high­est daily Covid-19 death tolls yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ger­many’s new Covid-19 cases rose by 8,397 yes­ter­day, the high­est since the pan­demic be­gan. There were also 44 new fa­tal­i­ties yes­ter­day, lift­ing the over­all num­ber of deaths to 9,842.</p>
    <p>The spread caused the alpine district of Ber­cht­es­gadener Land near the Aus­trian bor­der to i mpose sweep­ing re­stric­tions on move­ment.</p>
    <p>The pop­u­lar tourism des­ti­na­tion with about 106,000 peo­ple will close schools, shut­ter sports and leisure fa­cil­i­ties, and con­fine peo­ple to their homes un­less they have a “solid” rea­son to leave.</p>
    <p>“If we stand up to the pan­demic, we can come out of this stronger,” said Mr Bern­hard Kern, the district’s ad­min­is­tra­tor, adding that a fur­ther in­crease in in­fec­tions “is to be feared”.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Bul­garia re­ported a record high of 1,024 new cases, the first time daily in­fec­tions have gone past 1,000. The Bul­gar­ian au­thor­i­ties have said they will con­sider in­tro­duc­ing com­pul­sory mask wear­ing out­doors. Un­til now, the gov­ern­ment has ruled out in­tro­duc­ing new na­tion­wide re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Hun­gary re­ported a daily record of 38 coro­n­avirus deaths yes­ter­day, while the num­ber of those be­ing treated on ven­ti­la­tors has al­most quadru­pled this month.</p>
    <p>Virol­o­gists ad­vis­ing the gov­ern­ment have said Hun­gary risks los­ing track of in­fec­tions with its low rate of test­ing.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Ukraine re­ported a record 113 deaths from Covid-19 yes­ter­day over a 24-hour pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Else­where in Europe, Ire­land im­posed some of the most se­vere re­stric­tions in the bloc, with non-es­sen­tial stores, bars and restau­rants forced to close for at least six weeks.</p>
    <p>“The ev­i­dence of a po­ten­tially grave sit­u­a­tion ar­riv­ing in the weeks ahead is too strong,” Ir­ish Prime Min­is­ter Micheal Martin said late on Mon­day in a tele­vised ad­dress from Dublin. “Fur­ther ac­tion is now re­quired.”</p>
    <p>Travel will also be fur­ther re­stricted, with peo­ple told to stay within 5km of their home.</p>
    <p>Wales is fol­low­ing suit for two weeks.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple in Wales will be re­quired to stay home from Fri­day un­til Nov 9, and all pubs, restau­rants and non-es­sen­tial retail out­lets will be closed.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son has in­sisted that he does not want sim­i­lar mea­sures across the bor­der in Eng­land. The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment is push­ing lead­ers in Manch­ester, north-west Eng­land, to agree to tighter re­stric­tions or face new rules be­ing im­posed against their will.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Ital­ian re­gion of Lom­bardy, which in­cludes Mi­lan, is due to im­pose a cur­few from 11pm to 5am. Other re­gions are also con­sid­er­ing such a move, ac­cord­ing to Ital­ian me­dia re­ports.</p>
    <p>In Bel­gium, all restau­rants, bars and cafes in the coun­try have been re­quired to re­main closed for four weeks since Mon­day.</p>
    <p>A cur­few from mid­night to 5am is also in ef­fect.</p>
    <p>The Madrid au­thor­i­ties are study­ing whether to ask the Span­ish gov­ern­ment to im­pose a cur­few for when the state of emer­gency cur­rently en­forced by or­der of the cen­tral gov­ern­ment is lifted, ac­cord­ing to Span­ish me­dia.</p>
    <p>“It wouldn’t be a de­ci­sion to be ap­plied only in Madrid,” Mr En­rique Ruiz Escudero, the re­gional ad­min­is­tra­tion’s se­nior health of­fi­cial, told news­pa­per El Pais.</p>
    <p>“It wouldn’t be bad for us, as long as we can de­ter­mine open­ing times for eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>In east­ern Europe, the Czech gov­ern­ment or­dered peo­ple to wear face masks in pub­lic and in­side cars if the pas­sen­gers are not re­lated.</p>
    <p>Aside from na­tional mea­sures, the Euro­pean Union plans to re­move Canada, Tu­nisia and Ge­or­gia from its list of coun­tries whose res­i­dents should be al­lowed to visit the bloc, ac­cord­ing to EU of­fi­cials fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The United States will re­main black­listed along with most other coun­tries in the world, ac­cord­ing to the pro­posal, which was sub­ject to ap­proval by diplo­mats meet­ing in Brus­sels yes­ter­day and today.</p>
    <p>The EU in­tends at the same time to re­open its doors to trav­ellers from Sin­ga­pore as a re­sult of im­proved virus trends in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>CUR­FEW IN SPAIN</p>
    <p>It wouldn’t be a de­ci­sion to be ap­plied only in Madrid. It wouldn’t be bad for us, as long as we can de­ter­mine open­ing times for eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
