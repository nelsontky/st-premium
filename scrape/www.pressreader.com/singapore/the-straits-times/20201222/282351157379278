    <p>Gold climbed to a six-week high yes­ter­day, driven by news that United States con­gres­sional lead­ers had reached an agree­ment on a Covid-19 aid pack­age, while lock­downs in Bri­tain soured ap­petite for riskier as­sets and added to the metal’s sup­port.</p>
    <p>Spot gold rose 0.9 per cent to US$1,896.56 an ounce by 0745 GMT, hav­ing ear­lier hit its high­est since Nov 9 at US$1,906.46.</p>
    <p>US gold fu­tures gained 0.8 per cent to US$1,904.20.</p>
    <p>The US$900 bil­lion (S$1.2 tril­lion) stim­u­lus deal reached on Sun­day comes as the pan­demic ac­cel­er­ates, in­fect­ing more than 214,000 peo­ple in the US each day.</p>
    <p>“Now that we’ve got fis­cal stim­u­lus be­hind us, gold has enough mo­men­tum to close above US$1,900 by year end and it could climb up to US$1,925,” said Axi chief global mar­ket strate­gist Stephen Innes, adding that dovish cen­tral bank poli­cies sig­nalled last week were also sup­port­ive.</p>
    <p>The Fed last week vowed to keep fun­nelling cash into fi­nan­cial mar­kets and keep rates low un­til a US eco­nomic re­cov­ery is se­cure.</p>
    <p>Aid­ing gold, Asian stocks slipped as Bri­tain’s Health Min­is­ter sug­gested tighter curbs in Lon­don and south-east Eng­land might stay for some time to counter a new coro­n­avirus strain.</p>
    <p>Gold has once again re­gained its safe-haven sta­tus as lock­downs have changed sen­ti­ment in the broader mar­ket, which looked past the pan­demic and into a re­cov­ery next year in­stead, said CMC Mar­kets chief mar­kets strate­gist Michael McCarthy.</p>
    <p>Sil­ver rose 4.4 per cent to US$26.91 an ounce, hav­ing hit its high­est since Sept 16 at US$27.38 ear­lier in the ses­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Innes said: “Sil­ver’s in­dus­trial de­mand is ‘bul­let­proof’ from the lock­downs as ex­port mar­kets re­main open and de­mand could get an­other boost from US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s push to­wards clean en­ergy.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s poli­cies to fight cli­mate change are sup­port­ive of sil­ver, which is used in so­lar pan­els.</p>
    <p>Plat­inum rose 0.1 per cent to US$1,036.87 and pal­la­dium fell 0.3 per cent to US$2,353.50.</p>
