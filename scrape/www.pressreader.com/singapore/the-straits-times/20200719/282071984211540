    <p>DUBLIN (Ohio) • Tiger Woods ad­mit­ted that he strug­gled with back is­sues on his way to a four-over 76 on Fri­day, but nar­rowly avoided miss­ing the cut at the Me­mo­rial Tour­na­ment for the first time.</p>
    <p>The 44-year-old, play­ing his first PGA event since Fe­bru­ary af­ter a Tour shut­down in March over the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, had never missed the cut in 17 ear­lier starts at Muir­field Vil­lage in Dublin, Ohio.</p>
    <p>But he made five bo­geys and a dou­ble-bo­gey against three birdies in the sec­ond round af­ter a 71 on Thurs­day, and had a long wait to know that record re­mained in­tact.</p>
    <p>“Not very good,” he said, when asked to as­sess his round. “I three­p­utted two holes early. What­ever mo­men­tum I was go­ing to cre­ate, I sti­fled that early and strug­gled the rest of the day.”</p>
    <p>He said his back, which like his knees has been sur­gi­cally re­paired mul­ti­ple times, be­gan both­er­ing him when he was warm­ing up.</p>
    <p>He added: “It’s go­ing to hap­pen more times than not these days. It was a bit of a strug­gle.”</p>
    <p>The back is­sues come with the year’s first Ma­jor com­ing on Aug 6-9 at the PGA Cham­pi­onship. The Amer­i­can stood on three-over 147 af­ter 36 holes, just above the cut line, as com­pa­tri­ots Tony Finau (69) and Ryan Palmer (68) over­came slow starts to share the lead.</p>
    <p>Start­ing on the back nine, overnight leader Finau strug­gled out of the gate with bo­geys on two of his first three holes.</p>
    <p>But mo­men­tum shifted his di­rec­tion when he saved par with a green­side bunker shot out of an awkward stance on the par-three fourth that rolled within inches of the hole. He went on to birdie three of his fi­nal five holes and sits atop the leader­board with Palmer at nine-un­der 135. Palmer suf­fered his first bo­gey of the tour­na­ment on his sec­ond hole but went er­ror­free the rest of the way.</p>
    <p>World No. 4 Dustin J ohn­son posted his sec­ond straight 80 for 16-over par af­ter win­ning the Trav­el­ers Cham­pi­onship last month.</p>
    <p>Bryson DeCham­beau’s sec­on­dround 76 in­cluded a quin­tu­ple-bo­gey 10 on the par-five 15th as he joined John­son, Rickie Fowler and Justin Rose in miss­ing the cut.</p>
