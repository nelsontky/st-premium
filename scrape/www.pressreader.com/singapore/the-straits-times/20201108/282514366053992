    <p>Sell­ing a dream home might be an emo­tional wrench for many of us, but the $18 mil­lion profit en­tre­pre­neur Mathilda Koh reaped cer­tainly helped dull the pain.</p>
    <p>Ms Koh, the 46-year-old founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of home-grown beauty brand Bioskin, told The Sun­day Times that she was more than happy to pack up and move when a Chi­nese busi­ness­man of­fered her $26 mil­lion for her Sen­tosa Cove home in 2013.</p>
    <p>She said she paid about $3.6 mil­lion for the 8,900 sq ft plot of land at Lakeshore View in 2006, and spent an­other $4 mil­lion cre­at­ing her ideal home from scratch.</p>
    <p>The lux­u­ri­ous two-storey bun­ga­low with a base­ment and a rooftop over­look­ing Ser­apong golf course took two years to build.</p>
    <p>Ms Koh, who has three chil­dren, lived in the house for five years be­fore sell­ing it just days be­fore the to­tal debt ser­vic­ing ra­tio frame­work kicked in at the end of June 2013. That turned out to be per­fect tim­ing as Sen­tosa prop­erty prices started head­ing south not long after.</p>
    <p>Four months later, Ms Koh found a “good buy” and paid $17.5 mil­lion for a 10,000 sq ft bun­ga­low at Sen­tosa Cove.</p>
    <p>“Who says Sen­tosa homes are not prof­itable? It all de­pends on buy­ing the right prop­erty at the right time,” she said in Man­darin.</p>
    <p>Last year, she also bought a unit at Seas­cape for $3.1 mil­lion or</p>
    <p>$1,327 per square foot (psf), which is lower than this year’s me­dian price of $1,394 psf and well un­der the $6.26 mil­lion the seller paid in 2010.</p>
    <p>The unit is be­ing rented by a French fam­ily for $8,800 a month.</p>
    <p>Ms Koh is con­fi­dent that prices in the posh sea­side en­clave will re­cover: “Sen­tosa is very unique. It is the only place where for­eign­ers can buy landed prop­erty.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery night my hus­band and I would take a walk or go for a jog around the neigh­bour­hood. We see so many Rolls-Royces and supercars in Sen­tosa Cove.</p>
    <p>“There are many ul­tra-rich for­eign­ers liv­ing here. And when they com­pare prop­erty prices here with those in other places like Ja­pan and Hong Kong, Sin­ga­pore prices are much lower.</p>
    <p>“With lim­ited sup­ply of landed prop­er­ties on Sen­tosa and gov­ern­ment in­ter­ven­tions to sta­bilise the prop­erty mar­ket, I am con­fi­dent Sen­tosa will soon re­vive.”</p>
    <p>It’s no sur­prise that Ms Koh is a firm be­liever in real es­tate, hav­ing in­vested in some 40 prop­er­ties val­ued at over $100 mil­lion to­day over the years, in­clud­ing 15 com­mer­cial units in Eon Shen­ton and apart­ments in the Ma­rina Bay area.</p>
    <p>“It’s not just in Sen­tosa that prices are fall­ing. Prices in Ma­rina Bay Suites, Ma­rina Bay Res­i­dences and St Regis have also dropped,” said Ms Koh.</p>
    <p>“You need to have the hold­ing power to in­vest in prop­er­ties or else the risk is too high.”</p>
    <p>Ms Koh has been on Sen­tosa since 2008 and has no de­sire to live any­where else: “I won’t want to move to the city. The air is fresher here. The liv­ing en­vi­ron­ment is less dense. We get so much space here, our views are un­blocked. My chil­dren can even launch their kayak from the dock right out­side our house.</p>
    <p>“When my chil­dren are all mar­ried and move out, my hus­band and I plan to spend our re­tire­ment in a pent­house unit with a sea view on Sen­tosa.”</p>
