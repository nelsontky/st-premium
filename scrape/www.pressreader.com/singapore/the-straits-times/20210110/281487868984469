    <p>Space in­trigues me – the amount we have, what we need, what people can sur­vive in, what they choose. So I read about fish­er­men who sur­vived for 25 days in a box used to store fish and sub­mariners who live in what is ef­fec­tively an elon­gated, metal trunk. In Das Boot, the epic film on sub­mariners, a ship cap­tain asks one of them, “What’s it like down there?” Replies the sub­mariner: “It’s quiet.”</p>
    <p>Sixty-some­thing years ago, in a com­mu­nist state in Europe, a friend’s fa­ther was im­pris­oned as a young man. For a few years he was held in soli­tary con­fine­ment, alone in a room where the lights were never switched off, res­cued only by a game. In his head, he played chess.</p>
    <p>It’s a sober­ing and nec­es­sary im­age I carry with me for two weeks in room 204 in the Park Regis ho­tel. I have twin beds, an ex­er­cise mat and fine whisky. Nope, quar­an­tine is any­thing but jail. Iso­la­tion is not nec­es­sar­ily im­pris­on­ment.</p>
    <p>Back af­ter 71 days in In­dia with my un­well mother, my ho­tel room is an es­cape from In­dia’s din, a refuge from con­ver­sa­tion, a de­com­pres­sion cham­ber, a place to med­i­tate on par­ents, to ab­sorb Barack Obama’s mas­ter­ful book. Yes, what can I say: I love quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Herded ef­fi­ciently into a bus at the air­port; ho­tel room as­signed; food of my choice (no seafood please) de­liv­ered punc­tu­ally out­side the door by friendly staff; chauf­feured in my last days to a test­ing fa­cil­ity – quar­an­tine is an ef­fi­cient, restor­ing re­treat.</p>
    <p>My head is shaved any­way but I feel like a monk. On my win­dow pane a but­ter­fly set­tles af­ter a hic­cup­ing flight and a squir­rel squints sus­pi­ciously at me. The calm of quiet can­not be over­stated.</p>
    <p>I feel well pro­tected here, by god and govern­ment. In the cor­ner, a stately minaret of the Masjid Omar Kam­pong Me­laka rises amidst the trees. In front the Min­istry of Man­power frowns down at me.</p>
    <p>In two fat­ten­ing weeks I have been sent the fol­low­ing: bis­cuits, cho­co­late, yo­gurt, mousse, a disco bulb (don’t ask), beer, al­mond milk, cof­fee, a ther­mome­ter, books, a sponge, dish­wash­ing liq­uid, tow­els, Weetabix, a steak, a burger, mois­tur­is­ing cream, a dosa, a pedestal fan, chips, cheese, mints, parathas and wipes.</p>
    <p>At this point, you may feel the need to ask two ques­tions: Are you so rich in friends? Or am I so piti­ful?</p>
    <p>The ho­tel staff ev­i­dently can­not feel my plea­sure and are clearly – and cor­rectly – wor­ried about ev­ery­one’s men­tal state. With a thought­ful­ness that is touch­ing (and amus­ing), they send me – with my meals – tips to im­prove my English pro­nun­ci­a­tion, jokes, brain teasers and feel-good cards.</p>
    <p>“Stay pos­i­tive”, one card rightly sug­gests. “We are here with you till the very end,” another omi­nously de­clares. But my favourite is “Ev­ery cham­pion was once a con­tender that re­fused to give up”. Ru­mour has it that our old pal Rocky said it.</p>
    <p>It is strange to live in your own city at another ad­dress. A case of al­most home. People might feel dis­lo­cated, but I am in­trigued. Ho­tel rooms any­way re­mind me of Maya An­gelou, the writer, who told Ge­orge Plimp­ton in an in­ter­view that she “kept a ho­tel room in ev­ery town” she lived in. It’s where, ly­ing across a bed, with a bot­tle of sherry, a dic­tionary, an ash­tray and a Bi­ble nearby, she would ar­rive at 6.30am and write.</p>
    <p>I also write ev­ery day, but what quar­an­tine al­lows me to do is to day­dream, to be stuck in­side and yet wan­der the world in my head. We need no one’s per­mis­sion to ad­ven­ture.</p>
    <p>My room has a bay win­dow with a cush­ion stretch­ing the length of it. For two weeks I lie on it. There are bushes six feet away, a tree at 25 feet, and when I put my head near the glass I feel I am lean­ing into the out­doors.</p>
    <p>I won­der about Neil Arm­strong, hurtling to­wards the moon. Like him, I can’t step out of my door, though – bad pun alert – the grav­ity of our sit­u­a­tions is slightly dif­fer­ent. Ac­cord­ing to Nasa, the con­i­cal com­mand mod­ule, which housed the Apollo 11 crew, had “a max­i­mum di­am­e­ter of 3.9m at its base and a height of 3.65m”. My room feels big­ger.</p>
    <p>Quar­an­tine, of all things, makes me think of space: not the stars up there, but down here where we live. My room is com­pact but I am un­der­stand­ing how rel­a­tive the idea of small is. Priv­i­lege some­times can be mea­sured.</p>
    <p>For 18 of his 27 years in prison, Nel­son Man­dela lived in a cell in Robben Is­land which in some es­ti­mates was nine feet by seven feet. It is a lot of days in a very lit­tle space and yet it did not dent his hu­man­ity. It is here that he read In­vic­tus, the poem writ­ten by Wil­liam Ernest Hen­ley, who was in a hos­pi­tal re­cov­er­ing from tu­ber­cu­lo­sis when he wrote th­ese lines:</p>
    <p>In the fell clutch of cir­cum­stance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Un­der the blud­geon­ings of chance My head is bloody, but un­bowed.</p>
    <p>Space in­trigues me – the amount we have, what we need, what people can sur­vive in, what they choose. So I read about fish­er­men who sur­vived for 25 days in a box used to store fish and sub­mariners who live in what is ef­fec­tively an elon­gated, metal trunk. In Das</p>
    <p>Boot, the epic film on sub­mariners, a ship cap­tain asks one of them, “What’s it like down there?” Replies the sub­mariner: “It’s quiet.”</p>
    <p>A Tokyo cap­sule ho­tel, I dis­cover, can be 1.2m x 2m x 1m. Life in minia­ture, Ja­panese style. A sol­dier from that land, Yokoi Shoichi, hid in the jun­gles of Guam for over 27 years, well af­ter World War II was over, liv­ing in an un­der­ground room he dug which was three feet high and nine feet long. On lit­tle, hu­mans sur­vive.</p>
    <p>But per­haps no one finds ad­ven­ture in a tight space like spelunkers, who choose to slither through the stony canals of the earth. Th­ese cavers inch through places where light never ar­rives and as Mark Jenk­ins evoca­tively wrote in Na­tional Ge­o­graphic: “This is an an­cient, undis­turbed dark­ness, a dark­ness that has been here since the dawn of the world”.</p>
    <p>The ring­ing phone breaks my reverie. It’s my daily call from the au­thor­i­ties to check my iden­tity and where­abouts. It is a po­lite re­minder that this is se­ri­ous busi­ness, a land kept safe only through the rigours of dis­ci­pline.</p>
    <p>By the time you read this I will be home in Yio Chu Kang, al­most three months since a phone call about my mother’s stroke un­bal­anced my world. A whirl­wind of forms, travel, oxy­gen con­cen­tra­tors, catheters fol­lowed and I needed this ho­tel room at jour­ney’s end to re­plen­ish my­self.</p>
    <p>Still­ness has a heal­ing qual­ity. Si­lence re­stores equa­nim­ity. Some evenings, sit­ting by the win­dow, the gen­tle strains of the azan, the call to prayer, would curl through the dark­ness and fil­ter into my room. It moved me deeply for it was the sound of faith. And, in what­ever form, we all need it now.</p>
