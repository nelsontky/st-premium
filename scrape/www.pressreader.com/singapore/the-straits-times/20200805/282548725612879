    <p>NEW YORK • Nostal­gia has al­ways been a pow­er­ful source of rev­enue for Hol­ly­wood. It turns out this is equally lu­cra­tive for video games.</p>
    <p>From its be­gin­nings with the likes of Pong, a two-di­men­sional tableten­nis game, the video game in­dus­try has grown into a US$120 bil­lion (S$165 bil­lion) busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Over the years, mem­o­rable games have gar­nered strong fol­low­ings. Like Hol­ly­wood re­makes or re­mas­ters of old movies, video game pub­lish­ers are over­haul­ing and re-re­leas­ing games to tap ready-made fan bases for pop­u­lar fran­chises such as The Le­gend Of Zelda, Crash Bandi­coot, Spyro The Dragon and World Of War­craft.</p>
    <p>“I think nostal­gia is the ma­jor driv­ing force for the suc­cess of a re­make,” said Mr Doug Clin­ton, man­ag­ing part­ner of ven­ture cap­i­tal firm Loup Ven­tures, which fo­cuses on emerg­ing tech­nol­ogy and gam­ing. “Any game that doesn’t have mean­ing­ful nos­tal­gic value isn’t likely to be suc­cess­ful.”</p>
    <p>In May, Ac­tivi­sion Bl­iz­zard, the de­vel­oper be­hind World Of War­craft, an­nounced that two games from the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater se­ries, orig­i­nally re­leased in 1999, would be brought back this year.</p>
    <p>The re­make trend is not just for the most highly rated games. Chil­dren – and adults – who re­ceived SpongeBob SquarePant­s: Bat­tle For</p>
    <p>Bikini Bot­tom for Christ­mas in 2003 can now buy a “re­hy­drated” re­make, which hit stores in June.</p>
    <p>Al­though the game re­ceived de­cent re­views when it was first re­leased, it was by no means a clas­sic. But the re­mas­ter­ing shows how nostal­gia is driv­ing pub­lish­ers’ de­ci­sion-making.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause you can ac­tu­ally re­visit those vir­tual spa­ces, it’s a more pow­er­ful type of nostal­gia,” said Ms Al­yse Knorr, as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor of English at Regis Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Ini­tially, pub­lish­ers cap­i­talised on the nostal­gia trend by cu­rat­ing games from the 1990s on plug-and­play de­vices. But de­vel­op­ers saw an op­por­tu­nity to make even more money by in­vest­ing in sub­stan­tial up­grades.</p>
    <p>One of the big­gest events i n gam­ing this year was the re­lease of Fi­nal Fan­tasy VII Re­make. In 1997, Square Enix re­leased the orig­i­nal Fi­nal Fan­tasy VII, a fu­tur­is­tic cy­ber­punk epic with mul­ti­ple char­ac­ters and twist­ing plot lines that be­came one of the most beloved ti­tles in the Fi­nal Fan­tasy se­ries.</p>
    <p>Visu­ally, how­ever, the cre­ators had to make do with the tech­nol­ogy at the time. For ex­am­ple, the game had blocky-look­ing char­ac­ters, no voice act­ing and no 3D back­grounds.</p>
    <p>Af­ter years of teas­ing, Square Enix re­made the game to match a mod­ern ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Fi­nal Fan­tasy VII Re­make used en­tire teams of voice ac­tors, artists, an­i­ma­tors, en­gi­neers and pro­duc­ers to cre­ate a game that could stand up to any con­tem­po­rary re­lease.</p>
    <p>The strat­egy paid off: It be­came the best-sell­ing game of April, ac­cord­ing to data from the NPD Group, a re­search firm that cov­ers the video game in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Fans have largely been re­cep­tive to the re-imag­ined game, and its mod­ern sys­tems have made it ac­ces­si­ble to new play­ers who found the orig­i­nal me­chan­ics dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>“I tried the Fi­nal Fan­tasy VII re­mas­ter on Xbox; it was a lit­tle too far gone f or me,” said player</p>
    <p>Pre­ston Bakies, 27. “But when the re­make came out, I put a lot of time into it. It’s been a lot of fun.”</p>
    <p>Square Enix is not the only pub­lisher cap­i­tal­is­ing on this trend. Cap­com, the pub­lisher of Street Fighter and Mega Man, has also been rum­mag­ing through its back cat­a­logue.</p>
    <p>Last year, it re­leased Res­i­dent Evil 2, a re­make of the 1998 PlayS­ta­tion orig­i­nal. Not only was the re­make loved by crit­ics, it had sold 6.5 mil­lion units as of April.</p>
    <p>The suc­cess prompted Cap­com to green-light a Res­i­dent Evil 3 re­make, which was re­leased in April.</p>
    <p>Re­mas­ter­ing and re­mak­ing have be­come so com­mon that some stu­dios are ded­i­cated to bring­ing old games to mod­ern hard­ware.</p>
    <p>Blue­point Games in Austin, Texas, has a rep­u­ta­tion for cre­at­ing some of the high­est-qual­ity up­dates in the in­dus­try. In 2018, it re­leased a high-def­i­ni­tion re­make of Sony’s Shadow Of The Colos­sus, which orig­i­nally came out in 2005.</p>
    <p>Blue­point re­vamped the game in 2011, bring­ing the orig­i­nal up to 1080p stan­dards, and then sub­stan­tially re­worked it in 2018 for 4K tele­vi­sions.</p>
    <p>“We re­vi­talise an older game, some­body’s baby,” said Blue­point pres­i­dent Marco Thrush. “New gamers get to play games they oth­er­wise wouldn’t.”</p>
