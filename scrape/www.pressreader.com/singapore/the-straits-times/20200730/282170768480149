    <p>The High Court yes­ter­day sen­tenced econ­o­mist Li Shengwu to a $15,000 fine af­ter find­ing him guilty of con­tempt by scan­dal­is­ing the court in a Face­book post he made in July 2017.</p>
    <p>If he does not pay the fine within two weeks, he will have to serve a de­fault sen­tence of one week’s jail.</p>
    <p>Dr Li was also or­dered to pay $8,500 in le­gal costs and $8,070.69 for dis­burse­ments to the At­tor­neyGen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC).</p>
    <p>Dr Li, who said in Jan­uary that he would no longer par­tic­i­pate in the con­tempt pro­ceed­ings, was ab­sent from court.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old, an as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor at Har­vard Univer­sity in the United States, later re­sponded with a Face­book post say­ing he dis­agreed with the judg­ment.</p>
    <p>Dr Li is the son of Mr Lee Hsien Yang, the brother of Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
    <p>In his July 15, 2017, post, Dr Li wrote that the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment is “very liti­gious and has a pli­ant court sys­tem”.</p>
    <p>The post was re­lated to the on­go­ing fam­ily dis­pute in­volv­ing his fa­ther, his aunt Lee Wei Ling, and PM Lee over the Ox­ley Road home of their late fa­ther and Sin­ga­pore’s found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
    <p>Dr Li’s post also in­cluded a link to a 2010 New York Times ed­i­to­rial which crit­i­cised his grand­fa­ther.</p>
    <p>A screen­shot of the post was soon cir­cu­lated on web­sites and picked up by main­stream me­dia.</p>
    <p>On July 21, 2017, the AGC asked Dr Li to take down his post and is­sue an apol­ogy.</p>
    <p>He amended the post but did not delete it or apol­o­gise.</p>
    <p>On Aug 4, 2017, the AGC started con­tempt pro­ceed­ings against Dr Li.</p>
    <p>In his judg­ment yes­ter­day, Jus­tice Kan­nan Ramesh found that Dr Li’s post posed a real risk of un­der­min­ing pub­lic con­fi­dence in the ad­min­is­tra­tion of jus­tice.</p>
    <p>He said: “It is clear that the post con­veys the mean­ing that the ju­di­ciary is not in­de­pen­dent and im­par­tial, and is sus­cep­ti­ble to influence or pres­sure from the Gov­ern­ment where le­gal pro­ceed­ings are brought by its lead­ers.”</p>
    <p>The judge re­jected Dr Li’s ar­gu­ment that the post was pri­vate as it was vis­i­ble only to his Face­book friends.</p>
    <p>This ar­gu­ment, he added, skirted the core is­sue of whether it was rea­son­ably fore­see­able that the post would be re­pub­lished.</p>
    <p>Point­ing to court rul­ings in the US and New Zealand, Jus­tice Ramesh said: “There is no jus­ti­fi­able ex­pec­ta­tion of pri­vacy even where a Face­book post is pub­lished on a ‘Friends’ only set­ting.”</p>
    <p>In fact, Face­book it­self warns of the risk of re­pub­li­ca­tion, he added.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Ramesh said Dr Li ought to have fore­seen the risk of dis­sem­i­na­tion, given the sig­nif­i­cant in­ter­est in the Ox­ley Road dis­pute at the time, and that the post came from a mem­ber of the fam­ily at the heart of the dis­pute – which ar­guably lent it cre­dence in the eyes of the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Lawyers not con­nected to the case said that if the fine is not paid in two weeks, the AGC can go to court to ap­ply for a war­rant of ar­rest.</p>
    <p>This means that if Dr Li comes back to Sin­ga­pore, he could be ar­rested to serve the de­fault jail term, said lawyer Shashi Nathan.</p>
    <p>An­other lawyer, Mr Eu­gene Thu­raisingam, said con­tempt is not an ex­tra­ditable of­fence.</p>
