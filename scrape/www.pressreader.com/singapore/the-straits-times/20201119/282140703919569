    <p>Te­masek has signed an agree­ment with the Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search (A*Star) to es­tab­lish the Food Tech In­no­va­tion Cen­tre, a fa­cil­ity to ac­cel­er­ate the com­mer­cial­i­sa­tion of food tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>The state in­vestor said the mem­o­ran­dum of un­der­stand­ing with A*Star is part of a re­newed fo­cus on in­creas­ing its in­vest­ments in com­pa­nies and start-ups at home and across Asia that use in­no­va­tive tech­nolo­gies to pro­duce food.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment was made at a vir­tual me­dia brief­ing yes­ter­day, against the back­drop of the Apac Agri-Food In­no­va­tion Sum­mit also held on­line for the first time.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately at the sum­mit, Mr Alvin Tan, Min­is­ter of State for Trade and In­dus­try, had ear­lier high­lighted Sin­ga­pore’s achieve­ments in re­al­is­ing its am­bi­tion to pro­duce as much as 30 per cent of its food needs lo­cally by 2030.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore plans to achieve the goal by sup­port­ing lo­cal and for­eign firms that use in­door grow­ing tech­nolo­gies, such as hy­dro­pon­ics, ver­ti­cal farm­ing and data an­a­lyt­ics, to op­ti­mise pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>Te­masek has in­vested more than US$5 bil­lion (S$6.7 bil­lion) in the agri-food space over the past five years, nur­tur­ing a port­fo­lio of more than 40 agri-food com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>But most of the in­vest­ment is in Euro­pean and North Amer­i­can firms.</p>
    <p>Mr Anuj Ma­hesh­wari, Te­masek’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of agribusi­ness and Mid­dle East and Africa, said that while Western com­pa­nies had led the global agri-food sec­tor with tech­no­log­i­cal in­no­va­tions, Asia is now catch­ing up fast.</p>
    <p>“We cer­tainly see a lot more op­por­tu­ni­ties in Asia than we saw a few years ago,” he said, re­fer­ring to start-ups in the agri-food sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Mr Ma­hesh­wari added that many larger in­vestors, even big­ger than Te­masek, are chas­ing in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties in Asia’s agri-food space.</p>
    <p>“At one end, we have to grap­ple with a big­ger op­por­tu­nity set and on the other hand we see more com­pe­ti­tion. But we are com­mit­ted to in­vest­ing in the sec­tor given our fo­cus on not just gen­er­at­ing re­turns but also for a bet­ter planet,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ma­hesh­wari added that global food pro­duc­tion would have to be in­creased by 40 per cent to feed a world pop­u­la­tion set to hit a to­tal of 9.8 bil­lion by 2050, up from 7.7 bil­lion now.</p>
    <p>At the same time, agri­cul­ture uses 33 per cent of the world’s arable land for cat­tle farms, ac­counts for about 20 per cent of green­house gas emis­sions and con­sumes up to 70 per cent of global fresh wa­ter. There is a need to re-imag­ine food pro­duc­tion by us­ing in­no­va­tive tech­nolo­gies such as ver­ti­cal farms to cut land use, au­to­ma­tion to re­duce wastage and al­ter­na­tive ways of pro­duc­ing pro­teins to lower emis­sions.</p>
    <p>Mr Ma­hesh­wari also said that global in­vest­ment in tech-based agri-food start-ups hit US$20 bil­lion last year, up from just US$2 bil­lion in 2013, with the emer­gence of in­no­va­tive com­pa­nies such as Im­pos­si­ble Foods that makes burger pat­ties from plant­based pro­teins.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeoh Keat Chuan, Te­masek’s se­nior man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for en­ter­prise de­vel­op­ment, said pro­duc­tion of plant-based pro­teins and pre­ci­sion fer­men­ta­tion to make milk pro­teins will be the start­ing point of the col­lab­o­ra­tion with A*Star.</p>
    <p>He said sev­eral com­pa­nies have shown in­ter­est in the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Food and Biotech­nol­ogy In­no­va­tion, which was set up last year at A*Star to boost lo­cal pro­duc­tion ca­pa­bil­i­ties of novel food in­gre­di­ents.</p>
    <p>Most of these firms need pi­lot pro­duc­tion of small batches of their prod­ucts be­fore go­ing com­mer­cial, which is what the Food Tech In­no­va­tion Cen­tre aims to do.</p>
    <p>Be­yond sus­tain­able pro­teins, Te­masek will tar­get in­vest­ments in com­pa­nies that have in­no­va­tive ideas for re­silient sup­ply chains, af­ford­able nu­tri­tion and ur­ban food sys­tems.</p>
