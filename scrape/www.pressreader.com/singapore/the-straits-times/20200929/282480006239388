    <p>PARIS • When Swedish fash­ion brand Acne Stu­dios last hosted a cat­walk show in Paris in Jan­uary, it or­dered dozens of ve­gan-friendly rice bowls from cafe owner and caterer Pear­lyn Lee for mod­els and crew to pick on back­stage.</p>
    <p>Those types of or­ders have all but dried up since the pan­demic forced most lux­ury la­bels to can­cel par­ties and pre­sen­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>Even as some of the world’s big­gest brands re­turn to Paris on Mon­day, few are plan­ning phys­i­cal shows, a blow for make-up artists, light­ing spe­cial­ists, cater­ers and hun­dreds of other busi­nesses in fash­ion’s ecosys­tem.</p>
    <p>“Ba­si­cally cater­ing is gone for us. And I’m not sure when it’s com­ing back,” said Ms Lee, who only last year ex­panded her kitchen through a crowd­fund­ing cam­paign.</p>
    <p>From Mon­day, 85 brands will show­case wom­enswear looks dur­ing Paris Fash­ion Week. Only 19 – among them Chanel and LVMHowned Chris­tian Dior and Louis Vuit­ton – are press­ing ahead with so­cially dis­tanced front rows.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers are hold­ing small pre­sen­ta­tions by ap­point­ment, or stream­ing videos.</p>
    <p>Fledg­ling de­sign­ers can­not af­ford to hire big venues for tiny au­di­ences or risk a last-minute can­cel­la­tion, said Mr Se­bastien Vi­enne, from pro­duc­tion and press firm Mephistoph­e­les.</p>
    <p>None of Mephistoph­e­les’ 14 most reg­u­lar cus­tomers are stag­ing full events next week. In a nor­mal year, each event would have cost at least €30,000 (S$48,000) to €40,000.</p>
    <p>“We used to do four shows a day, our whole bud­get comes from these events,” Mr Vi­enne told Reuters.</p>
    <p>Still, he said he was op­ti­mistic rev­enues would pick up again in the longer run, as brands try to reach shop­pers vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>His com­pany is pro­duc­ing a fash­ion film, rather than a tra­di­tional show with an au­di­ence, in­side the 19th-cen­tury Ho­tel Le Marois for Pol­ish la­bel La Meta­mor­phose.</p>
    <p>The pala­tial venue has also been rein­vent­ing it­self, up­grad­ing its sys­tems to lure com­pa­nies want­ing to live-stream events from its or­nate rooms, site man­ager Va­lerie Taieb said.</p>
    <p>But even small par­ties are get­ting com­pli­cated as coro­n­avirus cases in France rise and re­stric­tions on gath­er­ings tighten.</p>
    <p>“The fash­ion sec­tor and the events in­dus­try have re­ally been for­got­ten in this cri­sis,” Ms Taieb said. Her team of about 20 have re­turned to work only part-time and are still re­ly­ing on the state’s par­tial un­em­ploy­ment aid.</p>
    <p>At the shoot for La Meta­mor­phose at Ho­tel Le Marois, 25-yearold model Tif­fany Fournier said some of her work had dried up too, al­though she still does mag­a­zine and ad­ver­tis­ing cam­paigns.</p>
    <p>“I haven’t done a cat­walk show since Fe­bru­ary,” Ms Fournier said.</p>
    <p>Some big brands have pushed to hold phys­i­cal events where pos­si­ble in part to sup­port sup­pli­ers and other busi­nesses. De­sign­ers also want to keep up con­nec­tions with pro­fes­sional buyers and me­dia.</p>
    <p>“There’s an en­ergy and an ex­cite­ment, there’s mu­sic, the first model to ap­pear on the cat­walk, ap­plause at the end,” said Mr Alexan­dre Mat­tiussi, cre­ator of French brand AMI. “That doesn’t ex­ist in a dig­i­tal for­mat.”</p>
    <p>AMI is plan­ning to hold a show on Oct 3, with fewer than 150 guests rather than the usual 600 to 700.</p>
    <p>“It will be like a very nice wed­ding,” Mr Mat­tiussi said.</p>
