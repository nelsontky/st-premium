    <p>Mr Roger Fer­gu­son and Mr Brian Deese would ar­rive with dif­fer­ent types of ex­per­tise, com­ing from two di­ver­gent money man­agers.</p>
    <p>TIAA has its roots in pen­sions for ed­u­ca­tors, with more than a cen­tury of his­tory while Black­Rock, which is lit­tle more than 30 years old, is a gi­ant in as­set man­age­ment and a key force in the shift to low-fee, in­dex-based in­vest­ing.</p>
    <p>• US Pres­i­den­t­elect Joe Bi­den is con­sid­er­ing Mr Roger Fer­gu­son, a for­mer Fed­eral Re­serve vice-chair, and Mr Brian Deese, an ex­ec­u­tive at Black­Rock, to be his top White House economic ad­viser, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>If se­lected, Mr Fer­gu­son, now the chief ex­ec­u­tive of TIAA, would be­come the first African-Amer­i­can in the role of di­rec­tor of the Na­tional Economic Coun­cil, a prime po­si­tion to guide the pres­i­dent on the di­rec­tion of pol­icy mak­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Deese, who was hired by Black­Rock in 2017 to over­see its sus­tain­able in­vest­ment strate­gies, was a se­nior ad­viser to pres­i­dent Barack Obama on cli­mate, con­ser­va­tion and en­ergy.</p>
    <p>Some on the left are not keen on ei­ther Mr Deese or Mr Fer­gu­son, who is on the board of Al­pha­bet Inc, Google’s par­ent.</p>
    <p>“How to deal with big tech is one of the ex­is­ten­tial i ssues fac­ing Bi­den’s ad­min­is­tra­tion,” said Mr Jeff Hauser, who runs the Re­volv­ing Door Project, an or­gan­i­sa­tion in Wash­ing­ton ded­i­cated to keep­ing cor­po­rate ex­ec­u­tives out of govern­ment. “It’s Larry Fink’s world, and pro­gres­sives are un­for­tu­nately still liv­ing in it,” added Mr Hauser, re­fer­ring to Black­Rock’s CEO. “I’m dis­ap­pointed.”</p>
    <p>The Bi­den tran­si­tion de­clined to com­ment on Wed­nes­day night. The peo­ple who dis­cussed his con­sid­er­a­tion for the post did so on con­di­tion of anonymity.</p>
    <p>The job is now held by Mr Larry Kud­low in the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Fer­gu­son and Mr Deese would ar­rive with dif­fer­ent types of ex­per­tise, com­ing from two di­ver­gent money man­agers.</p>
    <p>TIAA – Teach­ers In­sur­ance and An­nu­ity As­so­ci­a­tion of Amer­ica – has its roots in pen­sions for ed­u­ca­tors, with more than a cen­tury of</p>
    <p>his­tory, while Black­Rock, which is lit­tle more than 30 years old, is a gi­ant in as­set man­age­ment and a key force in the shift to low-fee, in­dexbased in­vest­ing. Its size and web of busi­ness ties have drawn crit­i­cism from both the right and left.</p>
    <p>While Mr Fer­gu­son, 69, led the en­tire TIAA op­er­a­tion, Mr Deese,</p>
    <p>42, ze­roed in on sus­tain­abil­ity at Black­Rock – a topic that is gain­ing ris­ing mo­men­tum in its in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Fer­gu­son was vice-chair­man of the Fed’s board of gover­nors from 1999 to 2006, the first black per­son to hold that post.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the Sept 11, 2001 ter­ror­ist at­tacks, then Fed chair­man Alan</p>
    <p>Greenspan was over­seas and deputised Mr Fer­gu­son to carry out what was ba­si­cally the cen­tral bank’s war plan for mar­ket crises.</p>
    <p>Mr Fer­gu­son has spent about 12 years as the chief ex­ec­u­tive of TIAA, ar­riv­ing there from the rein­sur­ance com­pany Swiss Re, where he headed its fi­nan­cial ser­vices. He</p>
    <p>also steered TIAA through the 2008 fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­i­sa­tion over­saw US$1.2 tril­lion (S$1.61 tril­lion) as of Sept 30, in­clud­ing the re­tire­ment sav­ings of many Amer­i­cans. That fig­ure is up from about US$435 bil­lion when Mr Fer­gu­son was cho­sen to run it in 2008.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­i­sa­tion an­nounced last week that he would re­tire in March.</p>
    <p>Mr Fer­gu­son, a na­tive of the District of Columbia, is the son of a pub­lic school teacher and a US Army car­tog­ra­pher.</p>
    <p>He has said that Mr An­drew Brim­mer, the first black gover­nor of the Fed, in­spired his ca­reer. Mr Brim­mer was nom­i­nated by pres­i­dent Lyn­don John­son in 1966, when Mr Fer­gu­son was a teenager.</p>
    <p>Mr Deese worked on Mr Obama’s 2008 cam­paign and joined his ad­min­is­tra­tion in 2009, ac­cord­ing to a White House bi­og­ra­phy. He was part of the task force charged with re­struc­tur­ing the au­to­mo­bile in­dus­try and later be­came deputy di­rec­tor of the Of­fice of Man­age­ment and Bud­get.</p>
