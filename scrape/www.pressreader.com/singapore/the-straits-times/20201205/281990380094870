    <p>The chase to tame the coro­n­avirus has been a world­wide pur­suit this year, gain­ing in­ten­sity and tak­ing on in­creas­ing ur­gency as the deadly pathogen spreads across con­ti­nents.</p>
    <p>In the United States – the worsthit coun­try in the pan­demic with the world’s high­est in­fec­tion count and death toll – Dr Mon­cef Slaoui has been at the helm of help­ing the na­tion bring a Covid-19 vac­cine to its mar­ket in record time.</p>
    <p>The re­tired vac­cine de­vel­oper, who spent nearly three decades at Bri­tish phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal gi­ant Glax­oSmithK­line re­search­ing a vac­cine for malaria, took on the role as chief sci­ence ad­viser of Amer­ica’s Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed in May.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive’s main aim is to speed up the find­ing, mak­ing and dis­pens­ing of a Covid-19 vac­cine.</p>
    <p>“We couldn’t have found any­one bet­ter than Mon­cef,” Dr Elias Zer­houni, a for­mer di­rec­tor of the Na­tional In­sti­tutes of Health, told USA To­day.</p>
    <p>“If there is one per­son in my view who has been there, done that, it’s Mon­cef Slaoui.”</p>
    <p>Moroc­can-born Dr Slaoui, 61, has been de­scribed as a hands-on leader with a fierce work ethic who never needs much more than four hours of sleep a night.</p>
    <p>He has vis­ited about a dozen clin­i­cal trial fa­cil­i­ties and man­u­fac­tur­ing sites to un­der­stand the Covid-19 vac­cine de­vel­op­ment process since he as­sumed the role.</p>
    <p>In tak­ing on the job, he had to give up his po­si­tions on the boards of US biotech com­pany Moderna and other firms that posed poten</p>
    <p>A sign call­ing for vac­cine study par­tic­i­pants at the Re­search Cen­tres of Amer­ica in Florida, dur­ing the phase three trial of Moderna’s Covid-19 vac­cine in Au­gust. tial con­flicts of in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>He says he has earned j ust US$1,001 (S$1,334) i n t he six months since he joined the gov­ern­ment ser­vice, but in­sists he is “hav­ing a blast” as his team­mates are all united in a com­mon mis­sion to make safe, ef­fec­tive vac­cines in the shortest pos­si­ble time.</p>
    <p>“No­body has a dif­fer­ent agenda,” he said.</p>
    <p>In Europe, Ox­ford Univer­sity pro­fes­sor Sarah Gil­bert is lead­ing the team with Bri­tish phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal gi­ant As­traZeneca, de­vel­op­ing per­haps the world’s cheap­est vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cine – whose ef­fi­cacy is re­ported to be as high as 90 per cent – built on re­search pi­o­neered by Prof Gil­bert and others on vac­cines based on a virus that causes com­mon colds in chim­panzees.</p>
    <p>In the course of her ca­reer at Ox­ford, Prof Gil­bert, 58, has set up her own re­search group to cre­ate a vac­cine that would work against all strains of flu, led tri­als of an Ebola vac­cine, and worked on de­vel­op­ing a vac­cine for the Mid­dle East res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome.</p>
    <p>Friends and peers have de­scribed her as a re­served, con­sci­en­tious per­son with “true grit”, BBC re­ported last week.</p>
    <p>Given the ur­gency of find­ing a Covid-19 vac­cine, she has been work­ing from very early in the morn­ing un­til late at night, some­times send­ing e-mails at un­ortho­dox hours.</p>
    <p>“From the be­gin­ning, we’re see­ing it as a race against the virus, not a race against other vac­cine de­vel</p>
    <p>op­ers,” Prof Gil­bert said ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>“We’re a univer­sity and we’re not in this to make money.”</p>
    <p>In Africa, Har­vard-trained ge­neti­cist Chris­tian Happi, the di­rec­tor of the African Cen­tre of Ex­cel­lence for Ge­nomics of In­fec­tious Dis­eases (Acegid), is at the fore­front of coro­n­avirus re­search on the con­ti­nent, ex­pected to be the last to gain wide­spread ac­cess to a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Acegid, housed in Redeemer’s Univer­sity in south-western Nige­ria, was the first lab­o­ra­tory in Africa to se­quence the coro­n­avirus genome.</p>
    <p>Its re­searchers have de­vel­oped a po­ten­tial DNA-based Covid-19 vac­cine specif­i­cally for Africa, but they face a strug­gle for fund­ing, ac­cord­ing to Cor­nell Univer­sity’s Al­liance for Sci­ence.</p>
    <p>Although there have been rel­a­tively few Covid-19 in­fec­tions in Africa than else­where – about two mil­lion cases against the global to­tal of 65 mil­lion – Pro­fes­sor Happi stresses that it is cru­cial to de­velop a vac­cine in­tended for peo­ple in Africa, given their ge­netic di­ver­sity and the dif­fer­ent pathogens cir­cu­lat­ing in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>“Ge­net­i­cally, Africans are dif­fer­ent from peo­ple in the Global North,” he said, ex­plain­ing that it was one of the rea­sons pre­vi­ous vac­cines for other dis­eases de­vel­oped in the West usu­ally fell short when ad­min­is­tered to African peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“If you want to de­sign a vac­cine for Africans, pri­mar­ily you need to start from Africa and un­der­stand how they are re­spond­ing.”</p>
    <p>The global ini­tia­tive of the Covax fa­cil­ity must also be cred­ited for its work as the world’s first at­tempt at a mul­ti­lat­eral ef­fort to en­sure fair and eq­ui­table ac­cess to Covid-19 vac­cines, no mat­ter rich or poor.</p>
    <p>Co-led by the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, the Coali­tion for Epi­demic Pre­pared­ness In­no­va­tions, and Gavi, the Vac­cine Al­liance, Covax has achieved the feat of pulling to­gether over 170 coun­tries rep­re­sent­ing nearly two-thirds of the world’s pop­u­la­tion to sup­port its cause.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers are promised ac­cess to the Covid-19 vac­cines the fa­cil­ity se­cures, and in Oc­to­ber, it met a sig­nif­i­cant mile­stone when about 80 wealth­ier na­tions com­mit­ted to make up­front pay­ments for the vac­cines.</p>
    <p>“The fact that the world is com­ing to­gether to try to put to­gether a shared vi­sion and a shared fa­cil­ity it­self is his­tor­i­cal,” Dr Seth Berkley, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Gavi, the Vac­cine Al­liance, told news site Vox in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve that this is the largest mul­ti­lat­eral ef­fort since the Paris cli­mate agree­ment... That’s a pos­i­tive thing.”</p>
