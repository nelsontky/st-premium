    <p>Bri­tish jet en­gine-maker Roll­sRoyce will man­u­fac­ture its wide­chord fan blades en­tirely in Sin­ga­pore and move some op­er­a­tions back to Bri­tain, as part of the aero­space gi­ant’s con­sol­i­da­tion plans amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic is cur­rently the only coun­try out­side of Bri­tain where Rolls-Royce man­u­fac­tures its hol­low ti­ta­nium wide-chord fan blades, used to pro­pel the Trent aero­plane en­gines on mod­els like Air­bus A380 and Boe­ing 787 Dream­liner.</p>
    <p>From next year, it will be­gin to con­sol­i­date man­u­fac­tur­ing vol­ume at its Sin­ga­pore cam­pus at Sele­tar Aero­space Park, Rolls-Royce an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>En­gine as­sem­bling and test­ing op­er­a­tions will be moved back to its plant i n Derby, Eng­land, said Dr Bicky Bhangu, the firm’s pres­i­dent for South-east Asia, the Pa­cific and South Korea.</p>
    <p>Rolls-Royce will seek other op­por­tu­ni­ties within its ecosys­tem here for the 300 or so work­ers in the Sin­ga­pore as­sem­bly and test unit, Dr Bhangu said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“With the ex­panded ca­pa­bil­i­ties in both our high-value fan blade pro­duc­tion and our main­te­nance, re­pair and over­haul joint-ven­ture fa­cil­ity, we are pre­sented with po­ten­tial op­por­tu­ni­ties for our peo­ple,” he said.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is also ex­plor­ing op­tions for the as­sem­bly and test fa­cil­ity to be used for “near-term aero­space growth ac­tiv­i­ties”.</p>
    <p>Rolls-Royce’s Sin­ga­pore cam­pus, its first Asia-based aero­space fa­cil­ity, was hailed as a ma­jor boost for the sec­tor when it opened in 2012.</p>
    <p>It em­ployed about 1,000 peo­ple here as of early this year, but an­nounced last month that 240 would be laid off as part of a global re­struc­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>Rolls-Royce said i n May that about 9,000 j obs world­wide – nearly a fifth of its to­tal head­count</p>
    <p>– would be slashed due to the dev­as­tat­ing im­pact of the coro­n­avirus on the avi­a­tion in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Dr Bhangu said the de­ci­sion to con­sol­i­date was sim­i­larly driven, adding that demand for Roll­sRoyce’s civil aero­space products and af­ter­mar­ket ser­vices has been badly af­fected.</p>
    <p>On the con­sol­i­da­tion, he said: “We be­lieve it will de­liver an op­er­a­tionally ef­fec­tive and sus­tain­able so­lu­tion for the re­duced level of demand in the com­mer­cial aero­space mar­ket that is ex­pected to take sev­eral years to re­cover.”</p>
    <p>He added that Rolls-Royce re</p>
    <p>Num­ber of jobs world­wide that Rolls-Royce said in May would be slashed due to the dev­as­tat­ing im­pact of the coro­n­avirus on the avi­a­tion in­dus­try. The num­ber is nearly a fifth of its to­tal head­count. mains fully com­mit­ted to Sin­ga­pore as a strate­gic hub for high­value man­u­fac­tur­ing and re­search and tech­nol­ogy, among other roles.</p>
    <p>Mr Shukor Yu­sof, founder of avi­a­tion con­sul­tancy En­dau An­a­lyt­ics, said the con­sol­i­da­tion of one of the largest aero­space com­pa­nies in the world un­der­scores the deep fis­sures brought about by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“What this says is it’s be­gin­ning to af­fect the sup­ply chain – it’s not just air­craft mak­ers but en­gine sup­pli­ers and those lower down the chain.”</p>
    <p>Rolls-Royce’s Sin­ga­pore plant caters to the Asia-Pa­cific, which was the fastest-grow­ing mar­ket be­fore the out­break, he noted.</p>
    <p>The merg­ing of op­er­a­tions be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Bri­tain was likely a trade-off, con­sid­er­ing the firm’s sig­nif­i­cant in­vest­ment here, Mr Shukor said.</p>
    <p>En­gines as­sem­bled here are for wide-body air­craft, such as the A330­neo and Boe­ing 777.</p>
    <p>“Those are not go­ing to be com­ing on stream for the next few years since there are no more in­ter­na­tional long hauls, so there is a mis­match be­tween the pro­duc­tion line and ac­tiv­i­ties be­ing done in Sin­ga­pore,” he said.</p>
