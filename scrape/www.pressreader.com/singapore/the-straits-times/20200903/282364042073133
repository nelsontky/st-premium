    <p>Sur­bana Jurong’s in­ter­na­tional chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Teo Eng Cheong has re­signed to pur­sue other in­ter­ests, said the ur­ban and in­fra­struc­ture con­sul­tancy yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Teo, 54, is a for­mer top civil ser­vant who joined Sur­bana Jurong in January 2016. He is mar­ried to Man­power Minister Josephine Teo.</p>
    <p>He will leave Sur­bana Jurong on Sept 30. The company did not say who will suc­ceed him.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to media queries, Sur­bana Jurong’s group CEO Wong Heang Fine said Mr Teo had been in­stru­men­tal in driv­ing the company’s busi­ness in­ter­ests in South-east Asia, North Asia and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“As Eng Cheong em­barks on a new ad­ven­ture, I would like to thank him for his last­ing con­tri­bu­tions to Sur­bana Jurong and wish him the very best,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sur­bana is owned by Sin­ga­pore in­vest­ment firm Te­masek.</p>
    <p>Be­fore join­ing Sur­bana Jurong, Mr Teo was a se­nior gov­ern­ment of­fi­cial with the apex Sin­ga­pore Ad­min­is­tra­tive Ser­vice and held top po­si­tions in sev­eral gov­ern­ment agen­cies.</p>
    <p>From 2011 to 2015, he was CEO of In­ter­na­tional En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore, which has since merged with Spring Sin­ga­pore to form En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He was also CEO of the Com­pe­ti­tion Com­mis­sion of Sin­ga­pore, now the Com­pe­ti­tion and Con­sumer Com­mis­sion of Sin­ga­pore, from 2008 to 2010, and di­rec­tor-gen­eral of Sin­ga­pore Cus­toms from 2004 to 2007.</p>
    <p>In May, Mr Teo made head­lines af­ter sev­eral posts were cir­cu­lated on so­cial media and mes­sag­ing plat­forms like What­sApp, al­leg­ing that Sur­bana Jurong’s in­volve­ment in de­vel­op­ing fa­cil­i­ties such as the com­mu­nity care fa­cil­ity at Sin­ga­pore Expo had led to con­flicts of in­ter­est. One such post con­cerned how he is Mrs Teo’s hus­band.</p>
    <p>The company re­futed the al­le­ga­tions, which it called “un­founded ac­cu­sa­tions of prof­i­teer­ing and cor­rup­tion”. It also out­lined how it got in­volved in set­ting up and run­ning the fa­cil­i­ties, not­ing it had been pro­vid­ing tech­ni­cal ser­vices to var­i­ous gov­ern­ment agen­cies amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Two men who ac­cused Mr and Mrs Teo of cor­rup­tion, and re­ceived let­ters of de­mand from Mrs Teo’s lawyers, sub­se­quently apol­o­gised and took down the of­fend­ing posts.</p>
