    <p>WASHINGTON • United States At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Wil­liam Barr will step down next week, he said on Mon­day, af­ter the Elec­toral Col­lege con­firmed Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s loss to Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Mr Barr, who had an­gered Mr Trump by not sup­port­ing his in­cor­rect claims that the Nov 3 elec­tion re­sult had been tainted by wide­spread fraud, said he would leave of­fice on Dec 23, be­fore Mr Bi­den is sworn in on Jan 20.</p>
    <p>Deputy At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Jeff Rosen will take over as act­ing at­tor­ney-gen­eral af­ter Mr Barr’s de­par­ture, Mr Trump said.</p>
    <p>“Our re­la­tion­ship has been a very good one, he has done an out­stand­ing job!” the Pres­i­dent said of Mr Barr on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>A White House of­fi­cial said Mr Barr re­signed of his own ac­cord.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump lashed out at Mr Barr on Twit­ter over the week­end af­ter The Wall Street Jour­nal re­ported that Mr Barr knew ear­lier this year about an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into Mr Bi­den’s son Hunter’s taxes.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump retweeted a com­ment from ra­dio host Todd Starnes say­ing Mr Barr should be fired for not dis­clos­ing the probe dur­ing the cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Mr Barr’s fate in the wan­ing days of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion had been in ques­tion since he said this month that a Jus­tice De­part­ment in­ves­ti­ga­tion had found no sign of ma­jor fraud in the elec­tion, con­tra­dict­ing Mr Trump’s claims.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s le­gal team ac­cused Mr Barr of fail­ing to con­duct a proper in­quiry into the al­le­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Barr’s res­ig­na­tion let­ter was re­leased af­ter he briefed the Pres­i­dent about the Jus­tice De­part­ment’s re­view into the Trump cam­paign’s voter fraud claims.</p>
    <p>In it, Mr Barr pledged the al­le­ga­tions “would con­tinue to be pur­sued”. He also praised what he called Mr Trump’s his­toric record, say­ing he had helped boost the econ­omy, strengthen the mil­i­tary and curb il­le­gal im­mi­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>“I am proud to have played a role in the many suc­cesses and un­prece­dented achieve­ments you have de­liv­ered for the Amer­i­can peo­ple,” Mr Barr wrote.</p>
    <p>Mr Barr has long been a staunch Trump ally, draw­ing scorn from Democrats and many of the de­part­ment’s own ca­reer pros­e­cu­tors who have ac­cused him of putting Mr Trump’s per­sonal in­ter­ests ahead of those of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“Wil­liam Barr was will­ing to do the Pres­i­dent’s bid­ding on ev­ery front but one. Barr re­fused to play along with Pres­i­dent Trump’s non­sen­si­cal claims to have won the elec­tion,” House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives Ju­di­ciary Com­mit­tee chair­man Jer­rold Nadler said.</p>
    <p>Prior to the elec­tion, Mr Barr re­peated Mr Trump’s un­founded claims that mail-in bal­lots could be sub­ject to fraud. He also in­ter­vened in sev­eral high-pro­file crim­i­nal cases in ways that ben­e­fited Mr Trump’s po­lit­i­cal al­lies, such as Michael Flynn and Roger Stone.</p>
    <p>Mr Barr last year tapped fed­eral pros­e­cu­tor John Durham to in­ves­ti­gate Obama-era of­fi­cials for pos­si­ble crimes in con­nec­tion with their probe into whether Mr Trump’s 2016 pres­i­den­tial cam­paign col­luded with the Rus­sian govern­ment.</p>
    <p>On Dec 1, Mr Barr dis­closed he had el­e­vated Mr Durham to the role of spe­cial coun­sel in Oc­to­ber so that he could con­tinue his in­ves­ti­ga­tion – a move that will make it hard for Mr Bi­den to re­move him un­til the probe has con­cluded.</p>
    <p>Mr Noah Book­binder, a former fed­eral pros­e­cu­tor who is now ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor for the pro­gres­sive ad­vo­cacy group Cit­i­zens for Re­spon­si­bil­ity and Ethics, said on Mon­day that Mr Barr “has done tremen­dous dam­age to the De­part­ment of Jus­tice and to the Amer­i­can peo­ple’s very faith in our jus­tice sys­tem”.</p>
    <p>“It is be­yond ironic that Barr seems to have been pushed out for not go­ing quite far enough to abuse his po­si­tion for Trump’s ben­e­fit, how­ever un­con­scionably far he did go,” Mr Book­binder said.</p>
