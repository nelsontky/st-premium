    <p>SYD­NEY • Qan­tas Air­ways has started tak­ing book­ings for in­ter­na­tional flights from July 1, in a per­haps op­ti­mistic view that by then, vac­ci­na­tions will have be­gun to curb the spread of the coro­n­avirus and travel de­mand will pick up.</p>
    <p>Ticket sales for Sin­ga­pore, Ja­pan and Hong Kong, which had been set to start in March, have been pushed back to July, while other des­ti­na­tions like Lon­don have been brought for­ward from Oc­to­ber, Aus­tralia’s na­tional car­rier said yes­ter­day. New Zealand is the only over­seas des­ti­na­tion to which Qan­tas is cur­rently fly­ing.</p>
    <p>“Re­cently we have aligned the sell­ing of our in­ter­na­tional ser­vices to re­flect our ex­pec­ta­tion that in­ter­na­tional travel will be­gin to restart from July 2021,” Qan­tas said. “We con­tinue to re­view and up­date our in­ter­na­tional sched­ule in re­sponse to the de­vel­op­ing Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Although coun­tries such as Sin­ga­pore, China, Is­rael, the United States and Bri­tain have started vac­ci­nat­ing their pop­u­la­tions, Aus­tralia is yet to au­tho­rise a Covid-19 jab and does not plan to of­fer a shot un­til March. The coun­try can­celled a lo­cal vac­cine devel­op­ment last month af­ter tri­als showed it could in­ter­fere with HIV di­ag­noses.</p>
    <p>Qan­tas chief ex­ec­u­tive Alan Joyce has said that a vac­cine will be nec­es­sary for quar­an­tine-free travel to re­sume to the US and Bri­tain, where in­fec­tions are surg­ing. Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son has or­dered a third na­tional lock­down in Eng­land un­til the mid­dle of next month on fears that the Na­tional Health Ser­vice will be over­whelmed.</p>
    <p>A han­ker­ing for travel among Aus­tralians has meant Qan­tas has</p>
    <p>been busy on the home front. Last month, Qan­tas said it ex­pected to fly the vast ma­jor­ity of its nor­mal do­mes­tic sched­ule in the first quar­ter af­ter ma­jor state borders re­open. By June, the air­line should be gen­er­at­ing enough cash to be­gin re­pair­ing its bal­ance sheet.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties do at least ap­pear to be on top of con­trol­ling virus clus­ters in Aus­tralia’s two most pop­u­lous states: New South Wales yes­ter­day recorded four new lo­cally ac­quired cases from the day be­fore, while Vic­to­ria had three. Still, New South Wales of­fi­cials are con­cerned af­ter an 18-year-old Syd­ney man tested pos­i­tive fol­low­ing a trip to out­back ar­eas. Test­ing clin­ics are be­ing set up in the re­mote towns he vis­ited.</p>
    <p>To date, the Aus­tralian gov­ern­ment has banned cit­i­zens from leav­ing the coun­try un­less they re­ceive an ex­emp­tion, which can in­clude travel for busi­ness, as part of the coro­n­avirus fight, or on com­pas­sion­ate grounds.</p>
