    <p>LON­DON/MADRID • Bri­tish For­eign Min­is­ter Do­minic Raab yes­ter­day stood by his govern­ment’s abrupt de­ci­sion to im­pose a twoweek coronaviru­s quar­an­tine on trav­ellers re­turn­ing from Spain, which has pro­voked anger and con­fu­sion among tourists.</p>
    <p>The mea­sure scup­pered the plans of many peo­ple ei­ther on hol­i­day or plan­ning to take one there and also hit the Span­ish tourism sec­tor hard just as it emerged from months of lock­downs and travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>The move to take Spain off a safe-travel list was an­nounced late on Satur­day and took ef­fect just hours later, l eav­ing trav­ellers with no time to dodge it or plan ahead.</p>
    <p>Mr Raab de­fended it as a “re­al­time re­sponse” to a jump in coronaviru­s cases re­ported in Spain last Fri­day, the lat­est in a month-long resur­gence in in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>“We can’t make apolo­gies... We must be able to take swift, de­ci­sive ac­tion,” he said on Sky News.</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion Labour Party’s health pol­icy chief, Mr Jonathan Ash­worth, slammed Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s govern­ment for its “frankly sham­bolic” han­dling of the mea­sure.</p>
    <p>At Madrid’s Bara­jas air­port, Ms Emily Har­ri­son, who was tak­ing a flight to Lon­don, faced hav­ing to self-iso­late for two weeks.</p>
    <p>“It’s re­ally bad be­cause it’s just come all of a sud­den. It’s not given (trav­ellers) much time to pre­pare,</p>
    <p>NO APOLO­GIES</p>
    <p>We can’t make apolo­gies... We must be able to take ’’ swift, de­ci­sive ac­tion.</p>
    <p>BRI­TISH FOR­EIGN MIN­IS­TER DO­MINIC RAAB, on the abrupt de­ci­sion to im­pose a two-week quar­an­tine on trav­ellers re­turn­ing from Spain, which has pro­voked anger and con­fu­sion among tourists.</p>
    <p>so ev­ery­one is now pan­ick­ing,” said Ms Har­ri­son, from Es­sex.</p>
    <p>Spain had been on a list of coun­tries that the Bri­tish govern­ment had said were safe for trav­ellers to visit – mean­ing tourists re­turn­ing home would not have to go into quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>But it has seen cases rise in the last few weeks, prompt­ing most re­gions to im­pose rules for masks to be worn ev­ery­where and, in sev­eral ar­eas in­clud­ing Barcelona, calls for peo­ple to stay at home.</p>
    <p>Most of the new cases have been con­cen­trated in the north-eastern re­gion of Cat­alo­nia and neigh­bour­ing re­gions, so a lot of the crit­i­cism has fo­cused on the fact that the quar­an­tine also ap­plies to ar­eas like the Balearic Is­lands, which have been spared the brunt of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain has been the coun­try hard­est hit in Europe by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Spain has also been badly af­fected, with more than 290,000 cases and over 28,000 deaths. It im­posed very strict lock­down mea­sures, grad­u­ally eas­ing them ear­lier in the sum­mer.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter John­son is set to roll out a £10 mil­lion (S$17.7 mil­lion) anti-obe­sity cam­paign, in­clud­ing junk food ad­vert bans, fol­low­ing his own Covid-19-linked brush with death that he partly blamed on his weight.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son will an­nounce his “Bet­ter Health” cam­paign to­day, which is ex­pected to in­clude en­cour­ag­ing doc­tors to is­sue “cy­cling pre­scrip­tions” for over­weight pa­tients, more seg­re­gated cy­cling lanes and a ban on junk food tele­vi­sion ads be­fore 9pm, ac­cord­ing to Bri­tish me­dia re­ports.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has given us all a wakeup call of the im­me­di­ate and longterm risks of be­ing over­weight, and the Prime Min­is­ter is clear we must use this mo­ment to get health­ier, more ac­tive and eat bet­ter,” said a govern­ment spokesman yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>LIT­TLE TIME TO PRE­PARE</p>
    <p>It’s re­ally bad be­cause it’s just come all of a sud­den. It’s not given (trav­ellers) much time to pre­pare, so ’’ ev­ery­one is now pan­ick­ing.</p>
