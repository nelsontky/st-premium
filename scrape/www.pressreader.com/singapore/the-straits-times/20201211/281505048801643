    <p>Sin­ga­pore will con­tinue its pi­lot for safe cruises after an el­derly pas­sen­ger on a cruise ship who first tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 on board was later found to be neg­a­tive in three sub­se­quent tests.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s pi­lot for safe cruises will con­tinue as planned, the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This comes after an el­derly pas­sen­ger on board Royal Caribbean In­ter­na­tional’s Quan­tum of the Seas fell sick and tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, forc­ing the ship to re­turn to Sin­ga­pore on Wed­nes­day, on day three of a four-day voy­age.</p>
    <p>But yes­ter­day, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said three sub­se­quent tests showed the 83-yearold man did not have Covid-19.</p>
    <p>MOH said it will sup­port the lab­o­ra­tory on board the cruise ship “in its re­view of its test­ing pro­cesses”.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, STB de­scribed the re­sponse to the case as “swift and ro­bust”, adding that pro­to­cols were val­i­dated by the re­sponse.</p>
    <p>STB chief ex­ec­u­tive Keith Tan said: “Safety re­mains our fore­most pri­or­ity ... (the) in­ci­dent has given us valu­able learn­ings for fu­ture sail­ings, such as the im­por­tance of us­ing TraceTo­gether for ef­fec­tive con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>“It has also given as­sur­ance that our es­tab­lished re­sponse to any fu­ture Covid-19 case is swift and ef­fec­tive,” he added.</p>
    <p>On the neg­a­tive test re­sult and the con­tin­u­a­tion of the pi­lot, Royal Caribbean said: “We wel­come this news, and we wish our guest a speedy re­turn to health.”</p>
    <p>The cruise op­er­a­tor added: “We ap­pre­ci­ate the guid­ance of the Gov­ern­ment, and we will con­tinue to work with them to re­fine our pro­to­cols.”</p>
    <p>Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said false pos­i­tives are a pos­si­bil­ity in any test, and other pro­to­cols are needed to com­ple­ment any test­ing regime.</p>
    <p>“While (the case on) Wed­nes­day might have turned out to be a false alarm, it has ac­tu­ally al­lowed the cruise in­dus­try to test all pro­to­cols to see how we can do this well, and do this bet­ter,” said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>“In fact, even as the vac­cine comes around and is made avail­able, we must con­tinue to have a rig­or­ous test­ing and track­ing regime to com­ple­ment the other parts,” he said at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence after a visit to the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Alice Lee Cen­tre for Nurs­ing Stud­ies yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Gent­ing and Royal Caribbean re­sumed cruises last month and this month, re­spec­tively, un­der the pi­lot scheme to re­boot the cruise in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The “cruises to nowhere” al­low pas­sen­gers to take part in ac­tiv­i­ties on board while out at sea for sev­eral days be­fore re­turn­ing to Sin­ga­pore. The ships must op­er­ate at a re­duced ca­pac­ity, among other safety mea­sures.</p>
