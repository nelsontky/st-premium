    <p>HANGZHOU • Chi­nese e-com­merce gi­ant Alibaba Group Hold­ing said or­ders made dur­ing its Sin­gles’ Day mega shop­ping fes­ti­val had ex­ceeded US$56 bil­lion (S$76 bil­lion) by yes­ter­day morn­ing, as con­sumers sought to cash in on a del­uge of dis­counts.</p>
    <p>Alibaba launched the an­nual on­line blitz ear­lier this year, with two pri­mary dis­count pe­ri­ods tak­ing place from Nov 1 through Nov 3 and again yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The com­pany will cal­cu­late gross mer­chan­dise vol­ume (GMV) over the full 11-day pe­riod, as op­posed to the usual 24 hours.</p>
    <p>As of 12.30am lo­cal time yes­ter­day, the cam­paign’s GMV had sur­passed 372.3 bil­lion yuan (S$76 bil­lion), with the or­der rate hit­ting a record peak of 583,000 per sec­ond, Alibaba said.</p>
    <p>It has said it will in­tro­duce more than two mil­lion new prod­ucts, dou­ble last year’s fig­ure.</p>
    <p>Other com­pa­nies such as Douyin – the Chi­nese ver­sion of ByteDance’s TikTok – JD.com and Pin­duo­duo are also hold­ing their own Sin­gles’ Day shop­ping events.</p>
    <p>JD.com, which started its shop­ping pro­mo­tions on Nov 1, said it recorded 200 bil­lion yuan worth of sales by nine min­utes af­ter mid­night yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Elec­tron­ics re­tailer Sun­ing.com – part-owned by Alibaba – said it made 5 bil­lion yuan in sales in the first 19 min­utes of the day.</p>
    <p>This year’s shop­ping ex­trav­a­ganza comes a week af­ter Alibaba lost al­most US$76 bil­lion of its mar­ket value fol­low­ing China’s sus­pen­sion of the US$37 bil­lion list­ing of Ant Group, the fi­nan­cial tech­nol­ogy firm Alibaba owns a third of.</p>
    <p>It also takes place as China ex­pe­ri­ences an eco­nomic re­bound af­ter get­ting the coro­n­avirus un­der con­trol within its bor­ders, fol­low­ing its emer­gence in Wuhan late last year.</p>
    <p>Over 340 firms, in­clud­ing Ap­ple, L’Oreal and Huawei, have ex­ceeded 100 mil­lion yuan in sales, with 13 brands record­ing GMV above 1 bil­lion yuan, Alibaba said.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s Fast Re­tail­ing said its Uniqlo brand ranked top for wom­enswear and menswear on Alibaba mar­ket­place Tmall.</p>
    <p>Top cat­e­gories of im­ported prod­ucts by GMV as of 9am were food sup­ple­ments, in­fant milk for­mula and beauty.</p>
    <p>Event head of lo­gis­tics Sun Jian told reporters that Alibaba was sani­tis­ing all parcels from abroad, given the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts ex­pect this year to be a boon for lux­ury brands, as Chi­nese con­sumers ac­cus­tomed to go­ing over­seas to buy high-end goods are now stuck at home due to coro­n­avirus bor­der clo­sures.</p>
    <p>Mr Andy Hal­li­well, re­tail an­a­lyst at dig­i­tal con­sul­tancy Publi­cis Sapi­ent, said in a client note: “The lack of con­sumer tourism which has hit Euro­pean and US stal­warts like Har­rods, Ga­leries Lafayette and Nord­strom will likely see big­ger spend­ing lo­cally”.</p>
    <p>On China’s Twit­ter-like Weibo, dis­cus­sions around Sin­gles’ Day trended while a poll by Sina Entertainm­ent, which gar­nered 174,000 re­spon­dents, found 76,000 peo­ple aimed to spend less than 1,000 yuan. Only 7,341 planned to dole out more than 10,000 yuan.</p>
    <p>Alibaba first launched the shop­ping event in 2009 and has made it the world’s big­gest on­line sales fes­ti­val, eclips­ing Cy­ber Mon­day in the United States.</p>
    <p>Last year, it recorded US$38.4 bil­lion in GMV on the day.</p>
    <p>Pop star Katy Perry made an ap­pear­ance at the com­pany’s gala for the first time late on Tues­day, al­beit via live stream, as travel re­stric­tions on for­eign vis­i­tors re­main in place in China.</p>
