    <p>The en­emy of my en­emy is my friend.</p>
    <p>This no­tion of state­craft, doc­u­mented in the an­cient San­skrit text, Arthashas­tra, ap­pears to be lend­ing fresh im­pe­tus to ties be­tween In­dia and Tai­wan as both take on an in­creas­ingly as­sertive China.</p>
    <p>Quot­ing an un­named source, Bloomberg re­ported last week that there is grow­ing sup­port within the In­dian gov­ern­ment to for­mally ini­ti­ate talks on a trade deal with Tai­wan, some­thing Delhi has so far held back from.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan has even been propped up as a po­ten­tial strate­gic part­ner for New Delhi af­ter the vi­o­lent bor­der clash be­tween In­dian and Chi­nese troops in Ladakh in June.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral rounds of talks since then be­tween Bei­jing and New Delhi have failed to re­solve the bor­der stand-off that con­tin­ues to mar bi­lat­eral ties and drive wide­spread an­tiChina sen­ti­ment in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Strate­gic an­a­lyst Brahma Chel­laney tweeted on Tues­day that “Tai­wan is to In­dia what Pak­istan is to China”, sug­gest­ing that In­dia help bol­ster Tai­wan’s de­fence ca­pa­bil­i­ties and fi­nalise a trade deal that would aid In­dia’s ef­forts to “de­cou­ple from China and its goal of at­tract­ing greater for­eign in­vest­ments”.</p>
    <p>Even prior to the bor­der clash, China’s pol­icy de­ci­sions, in­clud­ing on Kash­mir and the China-Pak­istan Eco­nomic Cor­ri­dor in Pak­istan­held Kash­mir, have riled In­dia.</p>
    <p>“China says In­dia must ‘re­main com­mit­ted to the one-China prin­ci­ple and ap­proach Tai­wan-re­lated is­sues pru­dently and prop­erly’. In the ab­sence of China’s com­mit­ment to a one-In­dia prin­ci­ple, why should In­dia stick to a one-China pol­icy?” said Dr Chel­laney.</p>
    <p>This surge in pro-Tai­wan sen­ti­ment in In­dia has also seen grow­ing bon­homie be­tween the two sides on so­cial me­dia, some­thing Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen has re­in­forced with her tweets thank­ing In­di­ans for their good wishes on Tai­wan’s na­tional day. She has also tweeted at least twice this month to ap­pre­ci­ate In­dian cui­sine and rem­i­nisce about her visit to the South Asian coun­try, draw­ing tens of thou­sands of “likes” from In­di­ans.</p>
    <p>The fo­cus on Tai­wan has also been strength­ened by a grow­ing ad­mi­ra­tion in In­dia and across the world for how well it has sup­pressed the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>In­dia does not have for­mal diplo­matic ties with Tai­wan but the two sides main­tain busi­ness and cul­tural links through the In­dia Taipei As­so­ci­a­tion in Taipei and the Taipei Eco­nomic and Cul­tural Cen­tre in New Delhi. In 2018, they signed a bi­lat­eral in­vest­ment agree­ment to fur­ther ex­pand eco­nomic ties.</p>
    <p>In­dia has, how­ever, been cau­tious about con­fronting China over Tai­wan. Air In­dia was forced to change the name of Tai­wan to Chi­nese Taipei on its web­site in 2018 fol­low­ing an ob­jec­tion from China. The In­dian Min­istry of Ex­ter­nal Af­fairs (MEA) had then said Air In­dia’s de­ci­sion was “en­tirely con­sis­tent with in­ter­na­tional norms and our own po­si­tion on Tai­wan since 1949”.</p>
    <p>China has also re­sponded strongly to last week’s reports of trade talks and has asked In­dia to ap­proach ties with Tai­wan “pru­dently and prop­erly”, in­sist­ing that Bei­jing would “firmly op­pose” any of­fi­cial ex­change be­tween New Delhi and Taipei. An of­fi­cial from In­dia’s Min­istry of Com­merce and In­dus­try told The Sun­day Times that there are no plans to launch such trade talks “as of now”.</p>
    <p>But the mood in In­dia vis-a-vis China has soured dras­ti­cally since the sec­ond in­for­mal sum­mit be­tween lead­ers of the two coun­tries in Tamil Nadu in Oc­to­ber last year.</p>
    <p>“Sino-In­dia re­la­tions have en­tered into un­charted ter­ri­tory and a lot of the things we took for granted be­fore the present bor­der dis­pute no longer ap­ply,” said Pro­fes­sor Harsh V. Pant, head of the Strate­gic Stud­ies Pro­gramme at the Ob­server Research Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>This re­assess­ment has prompted a greater de­gree of co­op­er­a­tion with coun­tries that share In­dia’s con­cerns over China. The in­clu­sion of Aus­tralia in the Mal­abar series of naval ex­er­cises slated to be held this year is one case in point. “If you look at it from that per­spec­tive, there is enough scope to re­vamp and re­cal­i­brate In­dia’s outreach to Tai­wan,” Prof Pant told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>“In­dia wants greater l ever­age with China, and Tai­wan is cer­tainly one of those levers. But this is some­thing In­dia can achieve by ex­pand­ing its am­bit of co­op­er­a­tion with Tai­wan within the ‘one China’ pol­icy,” he added. “It is in In­dia’s in­ter­est not to re­pu­di­ate the ‘one China’ pol­icy be­cause do­ing so will also en­tail some po­ten­tial costs.”</p>
    <p>In May this year, two mem­bers of Par­lia­ment from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) vir­tu­ally at­tended the swear­ing-in cer­e­mony of newly re-elected Ms Tsai and even sent her con­grat­u­la­tory mes­sages, a marked de­par­ture from In­dia’s usu­ally coy po­si­tion on Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>China also faced pub­lic back­lash this month when the Chi­nese em­bassy in New Delhi sent an ad­vi­sory to jour­nal­ists in In­dia ask­ing them not to vi­o­late the “one China” pol­icy while re­port­ing on Tai­wan’s na­tional day. The fol­low­ing day, the MEA said that In­dia has “a free me­dia that reports on is­sues as they see fit”. A BJP leader even put up hoard­ings out­side the Chi­nese em­bassy to wish Tai­wan a “Happy Na­tional Day”.</p>
    <p>Even Tai­wan has re­vived its fo­cus on In­dia of late through its New South­bound Pol­icy, which seeks to ex­pand co­op­er­a­tion with coun­tries that have not been at the core of Tai­wan’s strate­gic ma­trix so far. “In­dia is def­i­nitely a fo­cal coun­try of this new pol­icy,” said Ms Sana Hashmi, a Tai­wan Fel­low at the Na­tional</p>
    <p>Chengchi Univer­sity in Taipei.</p>
    <p>She also told The Sun­day Times that a free trade agree­ment (FTA) with Tai­wan would come “un­der the purview” of the “one China” pol­icy. “Coun­tries such as Sin­ga­pore and New Zealand al­ready have an FTA with Tai­wan. In­dia can take a cue from them,” Ms Hashmi added.</p>
    <p>Yet, a lot of ground­work needs to be com­pleted first to at­tract busi­ness from Tai­wan, in­clud­ing struc­tural re­forms that will make it eas­ier for Tai­wanese firms to in­vest and do busi­ness in In­dia. They re­main a key player in In­dia’s ef­forts to draw greater for­eign in­vest­ment in the technology and elec­tron­ics sec­tor.</p>
    <p>While bi­lat­eral trade rose from US$4.78 billion (S$6.5 billion) be­tween 2015 and 2016 to US$7.18 billion be­tween 2018 and last year, it fell to US$ 5.72 billion in the last fi­nan­cial year. Tourism ex­change has also been lim­ited, with only around 41,000 In­di­ans vis­it­ing Tai­wan in 2018 and an es­ti­mated 35,000 Tai­wanese vis­it­ing In­dia an­nu­ally.</p>
    <p>Ms Hashmi wel­comed the surge in pub­lic in­ter­est for Tai­wan among In­di­ans in re­cent months and hoped it would re­sult in greater en­gage­ment be­tween the two sides. “We should be push­ing for more and more peo­ple-to-peo­ple links, in­clud­ing through tourism, ed­u­ca­tion and wider aca­demic ex­changes. Th­ese are the ba­sic things that need to be in place, even be­fore we talk of el­e­vat­ing ties,” she said.</p>
    <p>CAU­TIOUS AP­PROACH NEEDED</p>
    <p>In­dia wants greater lever­age with China, and Tai­wan is cer­tainly one of those levers. But... it is in In­dia’s in­ter­est not to re­pu­di­ate the ‘one China’ pol­icy be­cause do­ing so will also en­tail some po­ten­tial costs.</p>
    <p>PRO­FES­SOR HARSH V. PANT, head of the Strate­gic Stud­ies Pro­gramme at the Ob­server Research Foun­da­tion, on In­dia’s bal­anc­ing act in us­ing Tai­wan as lever­age.</p>
    <p>BOOST­ING TOURISM</p>
    <p>We should be push­ing for more and more peo­ple-to-peo­ple links, in­clud­ing through tourism, ed­u­ca­tion and wider aca­demic ex­changes. Th­ese are the ba­sic things that need to be in place, even be­fore we talk of el­e­vat­ing ties.</p>
