    <p>It was a tale of two Cities. Liver­pool were al­ready look­ing ru­n­away lead­ers but Manch­ester City and Le­ices­ter City swopped sec­ond place.</p>
    <p>That was au­tumn, dur­ing a spell when Bren­dan Rodgers’ team won 12 of 14 league games and Le­ices­ter threat­ened to up­set foot­ball’s es­tab­lished or­der again.</p>
    <p>Now, be­lat­edly, it looks as though nor­mal ser­vice is be­ing re­stored.</p>
    <p>Le­ices­ter have been in the top four since Septem­ber but, with a fi­nal-day date against Manch­ester United, they risk be­ing dumped into the Europa League at the last minute.</p>
    <p>It would be a re­mark­able de­cline. Le­ices­ter were 14 points clear of fifth place in De­cem­ber. Ar­guably they were an out­stand­ing side for a third of the sea­son and an undis­tin­guished one for the rest of it.</p>
    <p>If their slide dates to the 4-0 Box­ing Day thrash­ing by Liver­pool, they are in the bot­tom half of the ta­ble for 2020 re­sults.</p>
    <p>And yet they were so good on their win­ning run that it is worth ask­ing what has gone wrong.</p>
    <p>A col­lec­tive relapse, a loss of flu­id­ity and so­lid­ity, is re­flected by in­di­vid­ual is­sues.</p>
    <p>In early De­cem­ber, Le­ices­ter were only one goal be­hind Liver­pool. They have scored only 28 times in 20 sub­se­quent matches.</p>
    <p>Jamie Vardy took on more cre­ative du­ties and got an as­sist as Sh­effield United were beaten on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>But, while he had scored in his pre­vi­ous three league games, he had found the net only once in an ear­lier match in 2020.</p>
    <p>Ay­oze Perez has one goal since Jan­uary, James Mad­di­son none and Youri Tielemans has not scored since Oc­to­ber, so too few oth­ers have stepped up.</p>
    <p>The greater is­sues, nev­er­the­less, are at the other end. Wil­fred Ndidi was ar­guably the divi­sion’s out­stand­ing de­fen­sive mid­fielder when he got in­jured in Jan­uary, and Le­ices­ter’s re­sults then suf­fered. He is fit again but yet to re­cap­ture such form.</p>
    <p>Ri­cardo Pereira has not played since Fe­bru­ary, de­priv­ing Le­ices­ter of a su­perla­tive right-back. On the left, Ben Chilwell has also been side­lined, though the teenage debu­tant Luke Thomas deputised well on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Caglar Soyuncu rep­re­sented a rev­e­la­tion but his stupid send­ing-off at Bournemout­h ended his sea­son.</p>
    <p>Kasper Schme­ichel had been a lone bea­con of ex­cel­lence but even he erred last Sun­day; it was a melt­down that brought back mem­o­ries of “Crys­tan­bul”, the trau­matic col­lapse Rodgers’ ti­tle-chas­ing Liver­pool suf­fered in 2014.</p>
    <p>The man­ager is less cock­sure these days. But his de­ci­sion-mak­ing has felt less good in the sec­ond half of the cam­paign and re­mov­ing Kelechi Iheana­cho af­ter 45 min­utes at Bournemout­h ranked as an er­ror.</p>
    <p>Now a meet­ing with Jose Mour­inho, whose Chelsea de­railed that Liver­pool ti­tle push six years ago, means his­tory could re­peat it­self again for Rodgers. He might be a dif­fer­ent sort of nearly man.</p>
