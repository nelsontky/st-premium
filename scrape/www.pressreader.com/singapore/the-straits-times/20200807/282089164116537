    <p>The Taoist Fed­er­a­tion has nom­i­nated five tem­ples to join a pi­lot pro­gramme that al­lows for an in­crease in the at­ten­dance limit for con­gre­ga­tional and other wor­ship ser­vices in places of wor­ship.</p>
    <p>If ac­cepted, the tem­ples will be al­lowed to host up to 100 peo­ple at any one time, dou­ble the cur­rent limit of 50.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment posted on its Face­book page on Wed­nes­day, the fed­er­a­tion said it would sub­mit the names of the five tem­ples to the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth (MCCY) for its ap­proval to join the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The five are Lorong Koo Chye Sheng Hong Tem­ple in MacPher­son, Loyang Tua Pek Gong in Loyang Way, San Qing Gong in Be­dok North Av­enue 4, Jin Fu Gong Tem­ple in Jurong West Street 92, and Thian Hock Keng Tem­ple in Telok Ayer Street.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Ro­man Catholic Arch­dio­cese of Sin­ga­pore said yes­ter­day that it has iden­ti­fied two churches that are ready to par­tic­i­pate in the pro­gramme, but did not name the churches.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan Thiam Lye, the Taoist Fed­er­a­tion’s chair­man, told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that the five tem­ples were cho­sen based on their pop­u­lar­ity and lo­ca­tion. The tem­ples would in­crease the num­ber of wor­ship­pers as soon as ap­proval from MCCY is granted, he added.</p>
    <p>The fed­er­a­tion said more tem­ples can ap­proach it to join the pro­gramme, but their ap­pli­ca­tions would be sub­ject to MCCY’s ap­proval.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment came af­ter the fed­er­a­tion said on Tues­day that it was dis­ap­pointed that none of its tem­ples were cho­sen in the pro­gramme’s ini­tial group of 12 places of wor­ship.</p>
    <p>The 12, an­nounced on Mon­day, com­prise mosques, Hindu tem­ples, churches, a Bud­dhist tem­ple and a Sikh gur­d­wara. From to­day, they will be al­lowed to ac­com­mo­date up to 100 peo­ple at any one time for con­gre­ga­tional and other wor­ship ser­vices.</p>
    <p>An MCCY spokesman said on Wed­nes­day that the 12 re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions an­nounced ear­lier were cho­sen af­ter con­sult­ing faith lead­ers and that they re­flect the re­li­gious di­ver­sity in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The min­istry added that re­li­gious lead­ers, who are also mem­bers of the Na­tional Steer­ing Com­mit­tee on Racial and Re­li­gious Har­mony, were con­sulted be­fore the list of 12 was drawn up.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the com­mit­tee in­clude the Ro­man Catholic Arch­dio­cese of Sin­ga­pore, Hindu Ad­vi­sory Board, Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore, the Na­tional Coun­cil of Churches Sin­ga­pore, the Sikh Ad­vi­sory Board and the Taoist Fed­er­a­tion.</p>
