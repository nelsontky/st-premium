    <p>WASH­ING­TON US Pres­i­den­t­elect Joe Bi­den will re­ceive a short­ened mil­i­tary es­cort to the White House in­stead of the tra­di­tional in­au­gu­ral pa­rade that stretches from the US Capi­tol af­ter his swearingin on Jan 20.</p>
    <p>The fes­tiv­i­ties will also in­clude a for­mal re­view of troops and a made-for-tele­vi­sion “Vir­tual Pa­rade Across Amer­ica” fea­tur­ing mu­si­cal acts, march­ing bands, po­etry, dance troupes and es­sen­tial work­ers, his in­au­gu­ral com­mit­tee said on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The scaled-down in­au­gu­ral plans rep­re­sent an­other con­ces­sion to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic as Mr Bi­den’s in­au­gu­ra­tion plan­ners bal­ance health and safety con­cerns with the pageantry of the con­sti­tu­tional cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>“There are many grand tra­di­tions to the in­au­gu­ral, and we plan to hon­our them by high­light­ing more of our na­tion’s peo­ple than ever be­fore while keep­ing ev­ery­one safe,” said pres­i­den­tial in­au­gu­ral com­mit­tee CEO Tony Allen.</p>
    <p>Plan­ners have urged Mr Bi­den’s sup­port­ers not to travel to Wash­ing­ton for the cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>Tick­ets to the swear­ing-in are avail­able only to mem­bers of Congress and their guests, and work­ers are tak­ing down the tem­po­rary grand­stands for dig­ni­taries to view the tra­di­tional pa­rade that ex­tends down Penn­syl­va­nia Av­enue from the Capi­tol to the White House.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the new com­man­der-inchief will con­duct a so­cially dis­tant “pass in re­view” of troops from ev­ery branch of the mil­i­tary on the East front of the Capi­tol. Cer­e­mo­nial units will then es­cort Mr Bi­den dur­ing his walk from 15th Street NW to the White House, which in­ter­sects 16th Street.</p>
    <p>The vir­tual pa­rade will be pro­duced by the same team that put to­gether the all-vir­tual Demo­cratic Na­tional Convention in Au­gust, which used short videos from across the coun­try in place of the tra­di­tional Roll Call of the States to nom­i­nate Mr Bi­den as the Demo­cratic nom­i­nee for pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>It re­mains un­clear whether Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump plans to at­tend Mr Bi­den’s in­au­gu­ra­tion, much less par­tic­i­pate in the tra­di­tional wel­com­ing of the in­com­ing pres­i­dent to the White House.</p>
