    <p>Fac­tory out­put has racked up its third straight month of con­trac­tion on the back of fur­ther de­clines in the volatile bio­med­i­cal sec­tor. Over­all pro­duc­tion fell 8.4 per cent in July from the same month last year – a steeper drop than the re­vised 6.5 per cent fall in June.</p>
    <p>Fac­tory out­put has racked up its third straight month of con­trac­tion on the back of fur­ther de­clines in the volatile bio­med­i­cal sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Over­all pro­duc­tion fell 8.4 per cent in July from the same month last year – a steeper drop than the re­vised 6.5 per cent fall in June.</p>
    <p>Ex­clude bio­med­i­cal man­u­fac­tur­ing and the de­cline would be 5.2 per cent, ac­cord­ing to Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board (EDB) data yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>JP Mor­gan an­a­lyst Ong Sin Beng said that de­spite these num­bers, man­u­fac­tur­ing is still ex­pected to lead the eco­nomic re­cov­ery while ser­vices lag due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He said: “Al­though the head­line se­quen­tial growth rates re­main neg­a­tive, the lev­els sug­gest that sta­bil­i­sa­tion is oc­cur­ring. Of note, tech out­put firmed in July and the broader in­dex, ex­clud­ing tech and bio­med­i­cal prod­ucts, also looks to be turn­ing up, fol­low­ing ma­te­rial weak­ness in the sec­ond quar­ter of this year.”</p>
    <p>Biomed man­u­fac­tur­ing out­put plunged 24.8 per cent com­pared with July last year, mak­ing it the sec­ond con­sec­u­tive month of de­cline.</p>
    <p>The med­i­cal tech­nol­ogy seg­ment was well down as well, drop­ping 10.1 per cent, while phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals fell 30.5 per cent due to lower out­put in bi­o­log­i­cal prod­ucts and a dif­fer­ent mix of ac­tive in­gre­di­ents from a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>United Over­seas Bank economist Barn­abas Gan said the dou­ble-digit fall could have been caused by fac­tors such as the nor­mal­i­sa­tion of bio­med­i­cal pro­duc­tion mo­men­tum from its March and April highs, and po­ten­tially bal­loon­ing phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal stocks, which could have dis­cour­aged fur­ther pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>“Still, we note that the ex­port de­mand for bio­med­i­cal prod­ucts con­tin­ued to stay strong,” he added.</p>
    <p>Said OCBC Bank head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy Se­lena Ling: “How­ever, if the var­i­ous on­go­ing Covid-19 vac­cine de­vel­op­ments are suc­cess­ful, there may be po­ten­tial for the next leg up for Sin­ga­pore if the bio­med­i­cal com­pa­nies here can par­tic­i­pate in the uptick.</p>
    <p>“Hence, it is pre­ma­ture to ex­pect man­u­fac­tur­ing out­put to sus­tain con­trac­tions for the rest of the year, even though the bio­med­i­cal pull­back was to be an­tic­i­pated as some of the global short­fall of med­i­cal sup­plies is eas­ing with the re­open­ing of economies world­wide.”</p>
    <p>Out­put in the trans­port en­gi­neer­ing sec­tor fell by 39.8 per cent com­pared with last July. The aero­space seg­ment re­mained weak as the vol­ume of air­craft re­pair and main­te­nance work stayed low.</p>
    <p>The ma­rine and off­shore en­gi­neer­ing seg­ment shrank 58.7 per cent as move­ment re­stric­tions at for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries con­tin­ued to im­pact the level of ac­tiv­ity in ship­yards, the EDB said.</p>
    <p>Gen­eral man­u­fac­tur­ing out­put also fell, by 22.2 per cent last month, with all seg­ments record­ing de­clines.</p>
    <p>Chem­i­cals out­put dropped by 2.4 per cent. The petro­chem­i­cals seg­ment grew 11.5 per cent but the other chem­i­cals seg­ment fell 15.2 per cent, while the spe­cial­i­ties and petroleum seg­ments con­tracted 16 per cent each, on the back of plant main­te­nance shut­downs and lower ex­port or­ders.</p>
    <p>Out­put for elec­tron­ics fell 1.4 per cent, but other elec­tronic mo­d­ules and com­po­nents pro­duc­tion rose 2.8 per cent, while semi­con­duc­tors ad­vanced by 0.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>The only clus­ter to re­port growth last month was pre­ci­sion en­gi­neer­ing, with out­put ex­pand­ing 9.3 per cent. The ma­chin­ery and sys­tems seg­ment within this clus­ter grew 20.4 per cent on higher pro­duc­tion of semi­con­duc­tor equip­ment but the pre­ci­sion mo­d­ules and com­po­nents cat­e­gory fell 14.7 per cent.</p>
    <p>May­bank Kim Eng economists Chua Hak Bin and Lee Ju Ye said: “While the pharma rally may be fad­ing, we ex­pect elec­tron­ics and pre­ci­sion en­gi­neer­ing to con­tinue to sup­port man­u­fac­tur­ing for the rest of 2020. De­mand for semi­con­duc­tors and re­lated equip­ment re­mains ro­bust.”</p>
    <p>But this might be dis­rupted by an in­ten­si­fy­ing US-China tech war, which could af­fect global sup­ply chains, or a sec­ond Covid-19 wave that might force lo­calised lock­downs, they warned.</p>
    <p>PO­TEN­TIAL FOR LEG UP</p>
    <p>If the var­i­ous on­go­ing Covid-19 vac­cine de­vel­op­ments are suc­cess­ful, there may be po­ten­tial for the next leg up for Sin­ga­pore if the bio­med­i­cal com­pa­nies here can par­tic­i­pate in the uptick. Hence, it is pre­ma­ture to ex­pect man­u­fac­tur­ing out­put to sus­tain con­trac­tions for the rest of the year, even though the bio­med­i­cal pull­back was to be an­tic­i­pated as some of the global short­fall of med­i­cal sup­plies is eas­ing with the re­open­ing of economies world­wide.</p>
