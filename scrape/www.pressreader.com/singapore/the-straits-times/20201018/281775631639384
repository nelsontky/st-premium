    <p>Mr Ah­mad Hazriq Isa has spent the past seven days sur­viv­ing only on bread, in­stant noo­dles and bis­cuits while look­ing for a new job.</p>
    <p>The 26-year-old be­came un­em­ployed for the sec­ond time this year, just min­utes af­ter the Malaysian govern­ment an­nounced last Mon­day that it would re-im­ple­ment move­ment curbs in the cap­i­tal city Kuala Lumpur, neigh­bour­ing Se­lan­gor state, and the ad­min­is­tra­tive cap­i­tal Pu­tra­jaya, as it fights a third wave of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The Con­di­tional Move­ment Con­trol Or­der (CMCO) kicked in last Wed­nes­day for two weeks, clos­ing down schools and the courts as classes and trial hear­ings moved on­line, with a ban on in­ter-district and in­ter-state travel.</p>
    <p>“I lost my job about 45 min­utes af­ter the an­nounce­ment. My boss pulled me aside and told me that he can no longer af­ford to pay me. This is my sec­ond time los­ing a job due to the pan­demic,” Mr Hazriq told The Sun­day Times. He lives in Klang, Se­lan­gor, a district hard hit by the cur­rent Covid-19 wave.</p>
    <p>Mr Hazriq was a rail­way tech­ni­cian be­fore he was laid off in March when the govern­ment first im­posed a par­tial shut­down, which saw most Malaysians stay­ing at home as schools and non-es­sen­tial busi­nesses had to close.</p>
    <p>He then joined a mo­bile phone com­pany as an ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cer and sales­man af­ter the curbs were grad­u­ally re­laxed in May. But this did not last long.</p>
    <p>“Things were ini­tially im­prov­ing from May on­wards, but when the num­ber of new cases soared, we strug­gled to break even. Ev­ery­one got scared be­cause of the high num­ber of in­fec­tions so they stopped vis­it­ing the mall where we’re lo­cated. Now I’m back to square one – be­ing job­less,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms So­raya Rah­man, 22, who had joined a mar­ket re­search firm ear­lier this year, found out in the past week that she would no longer have a job by next month.</p>
    <p>“They broke the news to me on the first day of the CMCO. They are lay­ing off a lot of peo­ple,” she said.</p>
    <p>Malaysia has been record­ing triple-digit cases daily since late last month, soar­ing to a record high of 869 yes­ter­day, with four more deaths to 180.</p>
    <p>While busi­nesses are still al­lowed to op­er­ate, many are barely stay­ing afloat as peo­ple stay home for fear of con­tract­ing the virus.</p>
    <p>Hawker Lao Yao Kee, 53, said: “I barely re­cov­ered (from the first round of curbs). I used up my sav­ings to sur­vive un­til I was al­lowed to re­open my stall in May. It was get­ting bet­ter for a bit un­til the cases went up again. I’m just glad I can still op­er­ate.</p>
    <p>“I now get the con­tacts of my cus­tomers so that I can send them daily pro­mo­tions. Get­ting 60 per cent to 70 per cent less sales than what I’m used to is still some­thing, as I’m on the verge of be­ing pen­ni­less.”</p>
    <p>Many malls in the Klang Val­ley were seen empty, with sev­eral re­port­ing fewer cus­tomers even be­fore the par­tial shut­down com­menced.</p>
    <p>One store at the Suria KLCC shop­ping mall said it be­gan clos­ing early at 9.30pm a few weeks ago, in­stead of the usual 10pm, as busi­ness had dived by more than 50 per cent since one pos­i­tive case was re­ported at a gym in the mall last month. “We used to see some 200 cus­tomers a day, but now we get around 70. The of­fice crowd has fiz­zled out, and even on the week­ends it’s quiet,” said a worker at the store.</p>
    <p>Many com­pa­nies have been op­er­at­ing in a work-from-home mode since mid-March, and some had be­gun re-im­ple­ment­ing this a few days be­fore the CMCO, fol­low­ing the surge in cases.</p>
    <p>Stores re­main open un­der the CMCO but only two peo­ple per house­hold are al­lowed to ven­ture out to shop. Some stores were seen clos­ing early at 8pm dur­ing the CMCO.</p>
    <p>Some peo­ple had ex­pected that some form of lock­down would be im­posed as case num­bers rose, and had been slowly stock­ing up on groceries and house­hold sup­plies. Gro­cery de­liv­ery slots were snapped up sev­eral days be­fore the CMCO was an­nounced.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, the first day of the CMCO, the streets of Kuala Lumpur and Se­lan­gor were qui­eter than usual and fewer com­muters were seen tak­ing trains to work.</p>
    <p>But some cus­tomers are happy though with the lack of crowds, and a num­ber of shops are of­fer­ing free­bies and vouch­ers to lure shop­pers back to the malls.</p>
    <p>Epi­demi­ol­o­gist Awang Bulgiba Awang Mah­mud of Univer­siti Malaya said it could take up to six weeks for Se­lan­gor to see an im­prove­ment, and that the govern­ment may ex­tend the CMCO.</p>
    <p>“It is likely that it will take a few weeks more for Se­lan­gor to see a sig­nif­i­cant drop in cases. Maybe four to six weeks,” Pro­fes­sor Datuk Dr Awang Bulgiba told ST.</p>
    <p>Se­lan­gor has the high­est Covid-19 re­pro­duc­tion num­ber (Rt) of 1.99 as new cases surge in the state. It recorded 159 cases yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Rt refers to the in­fec­tion rate and es­ti­mates the av­er­age num­ber of peo­ple that one pa­tient can in­fect.</p>
    <p>Prof Awang Bulgiba said if the jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for the CMCO was Se­lan­gor’s high Rt, then it may be ex­tended.</p>
    <p>“I do not think it will come down to less than one so soon. So it is likely that the CMCO will be ex­tended .”</p>
