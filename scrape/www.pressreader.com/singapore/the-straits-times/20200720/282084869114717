    <p>A shift in mind­set is nec­es­sary for busi­nesses to trans­form dig­i­tally in or­der to sur­vive the on­go­ing Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>And this change must come from both em­ploy­ers and em­ploy­ees – the will­ing­ness of firms to em­brace tech­nol­ogy and em­ploy­ees be­ing open to up­skilling and adapt­ing to changes.</p>
    <p>In fact, “at­ti­tu­di­nal” train­ing – the build­ing up of a good mind­set to­wards em­brac­ing change – is just as im­por­tant as skills train­ing, in­dus­try lead­ers said at a fo­rum or­gan­ised by Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore (SSG) last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The topic of how busi­nesses and the work­force can be re­shaped to mit­i­gate the fall­out from the pan­demic was dis­cussed at the fo­rum.</p>
    <p>Sup­ported by The Busi­ness Times and The Straits Times, the fo­rum is part of this year’s Skill­sFu­ture Month or­gan­ised by SSG and var­i­ous part­ners.</p>
    <p>More than 80 com­mu­nity, ed­u­ca­tion and in­dus­try part­ners are tak­ing part in the Skill­sFu­ture Month, which runs till Aug 16 and is ex­pected to reach out to more than 15,000 learn­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Choe Peng Sum, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Pan Pa­cific Ho­tels Group, said the im­por­tant thing about skills train­ing is that “we make sure that it also in­cludes mind­set change”.</p>
    <p>Us­ing a ho­tel as an ex­am­ple, he said it could in­volve teach­ing em­ploy­ees to have a busi­ness mind­set.</p>
    <p>“When (a ho­tel’s) oc­cu­pancy is down, many house­keep­ers say, ‘Oh good, no work!’. But if they know the busi­ness and we ex­plain the busi­ness to them, they say, ‘Oh dear, how are we go­ing to find the money?’ ” he said.</p>
    <p>When em­ploy­ees feel that they do play a part in the busi­ness, they get ex­cited about it and want to do more, Mr Choe added.</p>
    <p>“So I re­ally strongly be­lieve in com­mu­ni­ca­tion and at­ti­tu­di­nal train­ing.”</p>
    <p>Other pan­el­lists at the fo­rum were Mr Ong Tze-Ch’in, CEO of SSG; Ms Ade­line Sim, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor and chief le­gal of­fi­cer of HRnet Group; Mr Toby Koh, group man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Ademco Se­cu­rity Group; and Ms Su­san Chong, CEO of pack­ag­ing com­pany Green­pac.</p>
    <p>The dis­cus­sion was mod­er­ated by The Busi­ness Times’ dig­i­tal ed­i­tor Christo­pher Lim.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung de­liv­ered a speech be­fore the fo­rum.</p>
    <p>SSG’s Mr Ong said that at the heart of the Skills-Fu­ture na­tional move­ment, which pro­motes life­long learn­ing, “what we re­ally want is for ev­ery Sin­ga­porean to em­brace that growth mind­set... soak­ing up new op­por­tu­ni­ties, new skills and be ex­cited to learn new things”.</p>
    <p>Ademco Se­cu­rity Group’s Mr Koh sug­gested that one way to do this could be by help­ing em­ploy­ees see how ex­actly they can value-add to the com­pany by up­skilling and tak­ing on big­ger roles that ma­chines will not be able to ful­fil.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, se­cu­rity of­fi­cers are able to in­ves­ti­gate and in­ter­act with the pub­lic, as well as as­sess risks, whereas “tech­nol­ogy has its lim­i­ta­tions”, Mr Koh said.</p>
    <p>The way for­ward is for em­ploy­ees to keep im­prov­ing on their skills and knowl­edge, and learn to use tech­nol­ogy to their ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>In his in­dus­try, when that hap­pens, the re­mu­ner­a­tion could then rise to a level that is at­trac­tive enough for pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs) to con­sider work­ing as se­cu­rity of­fi­cers, said Mr Koh.</p>
    <p>“They would no longer be just pa­trolling around the place, in­stead, they are adding value to the in­dus­try,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh noted that, gen­er­ally, many busi­ness own­ers tend to look for peo­ple within the in­dus­try when mak­ing a new hire, but there is also value in open­ing up to peo­ple with di­verse back­grounds.</p>
    <p>“You get fresh ideas and a new way of look­ing at things... some­times, get­ting a fresh per­spec­tive is ex­tremely im­por­tant for (the busi­ness) to move ahead,” he said.</p>
    <p>SSG’s Mr Ong said that while up­skilling work­ers is not a new con­cept – the Skill­sFu­ture move­ment was launched in 2015 – the un­prece­dented Covid-19 cri­sis has made the need for re­train­ing and mind­set change more ur­gent.</p>
    <p>“The scale of it is un­prece­dented be­cause of the amount of trans­for­ma­tion and change that’s hap­pen­ing in the in­dus­try and work­place. We need to sup­port that and equip our in­di­vid­u­als and work­ers with skills for the new fu­ture,” he said.</p>
    <p>In his May Day speech this year, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong had said that, be­cause of the pan­demic, some in­dus­tries in Singa</p>
    <p>ADAPT, SEEK OUT NEW OP­POR­TU­NI­TIES</p>
    <p>Mid-ca­reer, ma­ture PMETs are one of the most vul­ner­a­ble groups. The com­ing months will not be smooth sail­ing. Work­ers and com­pa­nies will need to ad­just, adapt, build new ca­pa­bil­i­ties and seek out new op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>MR ONG YE KUNG (left), Min­is­ter for Ed­u­ca­tion, in his speech be­fore the Skill­sFu­ture Fo­rum last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>MIND­SET CHANGE</p>
    <p>The most im­por­tant thing is how do we make sure that skills train­ing in­cludes mind­set change?</p>
    <p>MR CHOE PENG SUM, CEO of Pan Pa­cific</p>
    <p>Ho­tels Group.</p>
    <p>VALUE IN THAT CHANGE</p>
    <p>Chang­ing peo­ple’s mind­set is the tough­est thing I have ever tried to do. But, at the end of the day, it’s about con­vinc­ing the team that there is value in that change.</p>
    <p>MR TOBY KOH, group man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of</p>
    <p>Ademco Se­cu­rity Group.</p>
    <p>FA­CIL­I­TAT­ING CA­REERS</p>
    <p>Up­skilling will pro­vide (work­ers who take up trainee­ships) a busi­ness net­work­ing plat­form so that they get to know the busi­nesses more, and it also fa­cil­i­tates their ca­reer.</p>
    <p>MS SU­SAN CHONG, CEO of Green­pac.</p>
    <p>pore will be dis­rupted per­ma­nently and some jobs will sim­ply dis­ap­pear.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies will have to change their busi­ness mod­els to sur­vive, and work­ers whose jobs no longer ex­ist will have to re-skill and move to new sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong noted that SSG is hop­ing to gen­er­ate more than 20,000 op­por­tu­ni­ties through the SGUnited Skills pro­gramme, a full-time train­ing ini­tia­tive tar­get­ing those look­ing to up­grade their skills while job hunt­ing.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme also serves as a busi­ness net­work­ing plat­form for trainees, said Green­pac’s Ms Chong.</p>
    <p>“(While in the pro­gramme,) they get to know the busi­nesses more,” she said, adding that this could make it eas­ier for them to plan their new ca­reer.</p>
    <p>With more un­cer­tainty, most work­ers and em­ploy­ers are con­cerned with how the job is go­ing to change… Any re­train­ing or reskilling pro­gramme must be in the con­text of what the busi­ness might get in terms of vi­sion, and where the worker wants to be.</p>
    <p>MS ADE­LINE SIM, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor and chief le­gal of­fi­cer of HRnetGroup.</p>
    <p>I hope that the series of Skill­sFu­ture Month ac­tiv­i­ties, both vir­tual and phys­i­cal, will al­low more Sin­ga­pore­ans to dis­cover new op­por­tu­ni­ties, ex­plore avail­able re­sources and con­tinue their in­di­vid­ual life­long learn­ing jour­neys, even amid these chal­leng­ing times.</p>
    <p>MR ONG TZE-CH’IN, CEO of Skill­sFu­ture</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore.</p>
