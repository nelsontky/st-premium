    <p>The dif­fi­cul­ties that some fam­i­lies are now fac­ing in hir­ing maids due to travel re­stric­tions should prompt a re­think of Sin­ga­pore’s heavy de­pen­dence on them.</p>
    <p>There were 252,600 for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers in Sin­ga­pore as at June. Many Sin­ga­pore­ans have come to see maids as ne­ces­si­ties rather than lux­u­ries.</p>
    <p>In other de­vel­oped coun­tries, do­mes­tic work­ers are hired by only the wealthy due to high min­i­mum wages. Most fam­i­lies need­ing help get child­care and el­der­care ser­vices via gov­ern­ment bod­ies, which co­or­di­nate with and sub­sidise pro­fes­sional ser­vice providers.</p>
    <p>It is time Sin­ga­pore be­gan to move to­wards pro­fes­sion­al­is­ing care­giv­ing ser­vices. The Agency for In­te­grated Care and the Early Child­hood Devel­op­ment Agency should ex­pand their ca­pac­ity to of­fer highly sub­sidised el­der­care and child­care ser­vices to any Sin­ga­porean who needs them.</p>
    <p>These ser­vices and sub­si­dies should be­come the first stop for fam­i­lies, and be over­seen di­rectly by the agen­cies to en­sure con­sis­tent qual­ity and cost-ef­fec­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>Given the cur­rent eco­nomic cli­mate, ex­pand­ing train­ing, place­ment and wage sub­sidy schemes for pro­fes­sional care ser­vices will make the in­dus­try more at­trac­tive for Sin­ga­pore­ans seek­ing se­cure em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Aside from the Gov­ern­ment, we as a so­ci­ety also need to ad­just our life­styles and mind­sets. Fam­i­lies should get used to do­ing reg­u­lar house­hold chores with­out de­pend­ing on a live-in maid, in­clud­ing a more eq­ui­table shar­ing of du­ties be­tween men and women. Those who re­quire only clean­ing ser­vices should make ar­range­ments with pro­fes­sional clean­ers in­stead.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers must recog­nise the need to ex­er­cise flex­i­bil­ity when their work­ers need to take time off for care­giv­ing needs, and the peren­nial is­sue of long work­ing hours has to be tack­led by the Gov­ern­ment, unions and em­ploy­ers. Cur­rent flex­i­ble work hours and work-from-home ar­range­ments should be­come more wide­spread rather than be priv­i­leged job perks.</p>
    <p>By re­duc­ing our de­pen­dence on maids, we can also elim­i­nate the long­stand­ing con­cerns over mis­treat­ment, abuse and in­debt­ed­ness faced by maids due to the power im­bal­ance, live-in re­quire­ments and ex­ces­sive re­cruit­ment fees charged by agents.</p>
