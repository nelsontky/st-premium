    <p>LON­DON • Ever­ton man­ager Carlo Ancelotti is not get­ting car­ried away af­ter their 1-0 Premier League win at base­ment club Sh­effield United on Satur­day lifted them up to se­cond in the ta­ble.</p>
    <p>The Tof­fees go into to­day’s topflight home game against Manchester City trail­ing only lead­ers Liver­pool, but the Ital­ian is main­tain­ing his stance that grab­bing a place in Europe will be the height of their am­bi­tions this sea­son.</p>
    <p>The vis­i­tors recorded their ninth win in 15 league games at Bra­mall Lane de­spite miss­ing a host of key play­ers due to in­jury, in­clud­ing James Ro­driguez, Lucas Digne and Al­lan.</p>
    <p>Gylfi Sig­urds­son’s goal 10 min­utes from time sealed the win and en­sured they will fin­ish in the top four dur­ing the Christ­mas hol­i­day pe­riod for the first time in 16 years.</p>
    <p>Ancelotti’s side last played in the Europa League in 2017-18 but ex­pec­ta­tions are ris­ing at Good­i­son Park that they can not only qual­ify for that com­pe­ti­tion but even push for the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>Pay­ing trib­ute to the bat­tling qual­i­ties of his play­ers, he said: “We’re se­cond for the spirit of this team, the mo­ti­va­tion and am­bi­tion the play­ers have for this sea­son. We’re not the top team but we are a solid team. This, in my opin­ion, is a re­ally good qual­ity for a team.”</p>
    <p>While Ever­ton re­main hot on the heels of their Mersey­side ri­vals and cham­pi­ons, Ancelotti in­sisted the goal for the sea­son had not changed, claim­ing he was un­likely to add to his squad next month as he was happy with the strength in depth.</p>
    <p>“The am­bi­tion and tar­get is the same for the sea­son; to reach a po­si­tion in Europe,” he said. “With th­ese play­ers back (from in­jury), we can still have a good sea­son, we don’t have to think about the Jan­uary trans­fer win­dow.</p>
    <p>“We are there (se­cond), we are pleased to be there but we don’t have a lot of time to think about it. We feel good be­cause we have prob­lems this mo­ment with a lot of play­ers out, but this team has a lot of spirit and this is good. I’m re­ally pleased to man­age th­ese play­ers.</p>
    <p>“I’m re­ally pleased be­cause I found the right club, a nice club, a fam­ily club. I live in a nice area so af­ter one year, I can say I was lucky.”</p>
