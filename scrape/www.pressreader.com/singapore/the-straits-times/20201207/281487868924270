    <p>Fund­ing for start-ups still flowed into Sin­ga­pore this year de­spite Covid-19. Ven­ture cap­i­tal firms and funds con­tin­ued to set up here, while some start-ups seized new op­por­tu­ni­ties aris­ing from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore re­mains a key in­vest­ment des­ti­na­tion in South-east Asia, with new sources of fund­ing con­tin­u­ing to flow in for start-ups de­spite the chal­lenges of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) chair­man Peter Ong said that while the $5 bil­lion of fund­ing lo­cal start-ups re­ceived in the first nine months of this year was lower than the $7.5 bil­lion recorded in the same pe­riod last year, the fig­ures still paint a re­silient pic­ture.</p>
    <p>The over­all quan­tum of fund­ing may have fallen, but the num­ber of deals has gone up, com­ing in at 453 this year com­pared with 410 last year.</p>
    <p>Fund rais­ing was in­evitably a chal­lenge given the pan­demic and the de­cline in in­vest­ment was ex­pected, Mr Ong said, not­ing the large fund-rais­ing rounds raised last year.</p>
    <p>But he is op­ti­mistic that there is spare cap­i­tal which start-ups can cap­ture.</p>
    <p>“I think ven­ture cap­i­tal firms still have dry pow­der,” he said.</p>
    <p>“They prob­a­bly want to wait and see, ‘Hey, let’s see who will sur­vive through Covid-19, and who knows how long Covid-19 could last? If I use up all my dry pow­der in the early part of Covid-19, what hap­pens later on?’ I think peo­ple adopt the wait and see (men­tal­ity).”</p>
    <p>Mr Ong was speak­ing to The Straits Times ahead of the Sin­ga­pore Week of In­no­va­tion and Tech­nol­ogy, which is held in con­junc­tion with the Sin­ga­pore Fintech Fes­ti­val from to­day to Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The vir­tual fi­nals for ESG’s startup com­pe­ti­tion Sling­shot will be held dur­ing the event. Par­tic­i­pants from 159 coun­tries took part in this year’s com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>Ven­ture cap­i­tal firms and funds have con­tin­ued to set up in Sin­ga­pore, Mr Ong said, such as Cal­i­for­nia-based Light­speed Ven­ture Part­ners.</p>
    <p>He pointed to three sec­tors with op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore firms – e-com­merce and its sup­port­ing in­dus­tries, agri-tech and ed-tech.</p>
    <p>“These are promis­ing and they play to Sin­ga­pore’s strengths (and what) we stand for in qual­ity, trust and re­li­a­bil­ity.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s small mar­ket means ex­pand­ing into the re­gion and far­ther afield are al­ways in the pipe­line for firms, Mr Ong said.</p>
    <p>The Global In­no­va­tion Al­liance (GIA), a joint ini­tia­tive be­tween ESG and the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board, looks to help Sin­ga­pore firms pen­e­trate mar­kets such as Jakarta, San Fran­cisco and Tokyo. There are 13 cities in the net­work where lo­cal part­ners help firms scale up in the mar­kets.</p>
    <p>This year’s mar­ket ac­cess and ac­cel­er­a­tion pro­grammes were con­ducted vir­tu­ally. The num­ber of par­tic­i­pants went up to 370, well up on last year’s 103.</p>
    <p>Pay­ments net­work firm Thunes is among the start-ups that have ben­e­fited from the GIA pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>It has se­cured com­mer­cial tieups in In­done­sia and Rus­sia af­ter tak­ing part in a vir­tual net­work­ing event ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>“For us, it’s very im­por­tant to get ac­cess to (banks or wal­let com­pa­nies) to get com­mer­cial agree­ments go­ing, and of course, build­ing tech­ni­cal and fi­nan­cial re­la­tions with them,” said Thunes chief ex­ec­u­tive Peter De Caluwe.</p>
    <p>While it is dif­fi­cult for a start-up to nor­mally get such op­por­tu­ni­ties, tap­ping ESG’s net­work has given it ac­cess to mar­ket op­por­tu­ni­ties abroad, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong noted how some star­tups have seized new op­por­tu­ni­ties that arose dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ro­bot­ics firm Lion­sBot In­ter­na­tional, for one, has de­vel­oped a line of ro­bots that dis­in­fect sur­faces us­ing ul­travi­o­let-c light.</p>
    <p>This means that be­yond its floor­clean­ing range of ma­chines, which won the Am­s­ter­dam In­no­va­tion Award this year, the start-up can move into the health­care sec­tor where dis­in­fec­tion stan­dards are more de­mand­ing, Mr Ong said.</p>
    <p>A re­silient start-up ecosys­tem is built through the ef­forts of its com­mu­nity, and not just about what the gov­ern­ment can do for it, he noted, adding that he has been en­cour­aged by ground-up ini­tia­tives ev­i­dent dur­ing this try­ing pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Ven­ture cap­i­tal firms, such as Jun­gle Ven­tures and Al­pha JWC Ven­tures, are help­ing start-up em­ploy­ees who were laid off to find new job op­por­tu­ni­ties. Ca­reer coaches are also on hand to pro­vide free ad­vi­sory ser­vices to job seek­ers.</p>
    <p>“For them to do that shows that... many of them feel a strong sense of be­ing in­vested in the com­mu­nity. It’s not some­thing out there but ‘we are part of it, and if one part suf­fers, we all chip in to help’,” said Mr Ong, not­ing how gen­er­a­tions of suc­cess­ful en­trepreneur­s re­turn to men­tor or in­vest in oth­ers in Sil­i­con Val­ley, a process he hopes will oc­cur here.</p>
    <p>Such suc­cess sto­ries could also in­spire oth­ers to go down the same path of en­trepreneur­ship, he added. “Noth­ing is a greater mo­ti­va­tion than to see (tech com­pany Sea founder) For­rest Li suc­ceed so well, or to see some other start-ups do very well... and then to see them give back to the com­mu­nity and help suc­ces­sive gen­er­a­tions.”</p>
