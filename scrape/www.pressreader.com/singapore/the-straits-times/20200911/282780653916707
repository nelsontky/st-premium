    <p>Malaysian actress Yeo Yann Yann may soon be adding another feather in her cap.</p>
    <p>Yeo, 43, was nom­i­nated for Best Actress at this year’s Asian Film Awards (AFA) for her role in Wet Sea­son (2019) af­ter win­ning in the same cat­e­gory at last year’s Tai­wan’s Golden Horse Awards for the same role.</p>
    <p>In the movie di­rected by lo­cal film-maker An­thony Chen, Yeo plays a Chi­nese-lan­guage teacher who forms a life-chang­ing friend­ship with a stu­dent while strug­gling with a fail­ing marriage.</p>
    <p>Wet Sea­son also stars Koh Jia Ler, Christo­pher Lee and Yang Shi Bin.</p>
    <p>Yeo will be up against Chi­nese ac­tresses Zhou Dongyu (Bet­ter Days) and Yong Mei (So Long, My Son) as well as South Korean actress Jung Yu-mi (Kim Ji-young, Born 1982), Ja­panese actress Mariko Tsut­sui (A Girl Miss­ing) and Thai actress Chuti­mon Chuengchar­oen­suky­ing (Happy Old Year).</p>
    <p>Yeo pre­vi­ously won the Best Sup­port­ing Actress award at the AFA in 2014 for Ilo Ilo (2013), also di­rected by Chen.</p>
    <p>South Korean movie Par­a­site, which won four awards at this year’s Academy Awards, in­clud­ing Best Pic­ture and Best Di­rec­tor for</p>
    <p>Bong Joon-ho, dom­i­nates the race at the AFA with 10 nom­i­na­tions.</p>
    <p>They in­clude Best Film, Best Di­rec­tor, Best Sup­port­ing Ac­tor for Choi Woo-shik and Best Sup­port­ing Actress for Lee Jeong-eun.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese movie So Long, My Son and Tai­wanese movie A Sun both re­ceived seven nom­i­na­tions each, in­clud­ing Best Film and Best Di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>A Sun won Best Fea­ture Film, Best Di­rec­tor for Chung Monghong and Best Ac­tor for Chen Yi­wen at last year’s Golden Horse Awards.</p>
    <p>So Long, My Son won Best Ac­tor for Wang Jingchun and Best Actress for Yong at the Ber­lin film fes­ti­val last year.</p>
    <p>Both Chen Yi-wen and Wang are also nom­i­nated for Best Ac­tor at this year’s AFA.</p>
    <p>They will be com­pet­ing against South Korean ac­tor Lee Byung-hun (The Man Stand­ing Next), Hong Kong-Tai­wanese ac­tor Tai Bo (Suk Suk), Ja­panese ac­tor Masa­taka Kub­ota (First Love) and Ira­nian ac­tor Hamed Be­hdad (Cas­tle Of Dreams).</p>
    <p>This year’s AFA will take place in Bu­san, South Korea, for the first time.</p>
    <p>The win­ners will be un­veiled on YouTube on Oct 14 due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
