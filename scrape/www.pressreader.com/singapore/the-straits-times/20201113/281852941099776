    <p>Post-pan­demic China was sup­posed to be good for Fang Guobao. As lock­downs loos­ened and on­line shop­ping soared, Mr Fang, a pack­age courier in the east­ern city of Nan­jing, was de­liv­er­ing about 250 parcels a day, up from 200 be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Then his pay cheques stopped. His boss asked for more time twice. Then she stopped an­swer­ing her phone.</p>
    <p>So Mr Fang and sev­eral col­leagues re­solved to stop work­ing. Even though the out­break had made jobs scarcer and will­ing work­ers more plen­ti­ful, they joined a string of other strikes and protests by couri­ers that is res­onat­ing through China and draw­ing greater at­ten­tion to their low wages and gru­elling work­ing con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>“You’re sup­posed to pay us. That’s only right and proper,” Mr Fang, 50, said. “If there was no per­sonal profit, who would want to be a part of this kind of thing?”</p>
    <p>The un­rest ac­cel­er­ated in the weeks be­fore Sin­gles’ Day, the on­line shop­ping event cre­ated by the e-com­merce gi­ant Alibaba, on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Alibaba, us­ing its own met­ric called gross mer­chan­dise value, said at the end of the event that Sin­gles’ Day sales across its platforms had to­talled US$74 bil­lion (S$100 bil­lion), nearly dou­ble last year’s record US$38.3 bil­lion, as China con­tin­ues to re­bound eco­nom­i­cally af­ter bring­ing its coro­n­avirus cases un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>But the worker com­plaints lead­ing up to it also sug­gest that, even as China has posted promis­ing macroe­co­nomic num­bers, low-in­come work­ers in par­tic­u­lar have con­tin­ued to strug­gle.</p>
    <p>Ex­press de­liv­ery or­ders of the kind Mr Fang fer­ries have surged, buoyed by in­creased spend­ing among the mid­dle and up­per classes. Yet that boom has not trick­led down to the couri­ers, known as kuaidi, the mostly male and un­skilled work­ers who zip around on elec­tric bikes feed­ing the coun­try’s on­line shop­ping ob­ses­sion.</p>
    <p>ABAN­DONED CRABS AND PARCELS GONE ASTRAY</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, couri­ers are go­ing miss­ing and pack­ages have gone astray.</p>
    <p>Work­ers in Hu­nan prov­ince</p>
    <p>went on strike last month for more than US$45,000 in back wages, leav­ing or­ders of hairy crab to rot in their boxes. In Shenyang, a city in the north-east, aban­doned pack­ages were dumped in an empty field last week.</p>
    <p>In­ter­net users have joked that their pack­ages are go­ing on va­ca­tion, post­ing screen­shots of track­ing de­tails that show their or­ders me­an­der­ing across the coun­try as they are redi­rected to func­tion­ing courier sta­tions.</p>
    <p>The hash­tag “What do you think of the courier strikes?” has been viewed more than 1.5 bil­lion times on Weibo, a Twit­ter-like plat­form, and was a trend­ing topic on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Dis­sat­is­fac­tion is com­mon in the courier industry, as are spo­radic protests. But the courier strikes now, when the pan­demic has left many other low-in­come work­ers un­em­ployed, un­der­score both their dis­sat­is­fac­tion and their des­per­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic may have lent the strikes more public sup­port, said re­searcher Ai­dan Chau at China Labour Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based labour rights or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Many com­menters on Weibo</p>
    <p>said they were will­ing to wait longer for their pack­ages. “Af­ter the coro­n­avirus, ev­ery­one knows that work­ers are hav­ing a hard time now,” Mr Chau said, adding that some peo­ple who had been in the for­mal econ­omy had them­selves been forced to pick up gig work.</p>
    <p>Many of the work­ers, who are mostly men from ru­ral ar­eas seek­ing bet­ter jobs in the cities, are not em­ployed di­rectly by the coun­try’s ma­jor ship­ping com­pa­nies. In­stead, they work for lo­cal fran­chises that help those com­pa­nies com­plete the last mile of de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>That model leaves many of the couri­ers – who num­bered more than three mil­lion at the end of last year, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial statis­tics – with­out for­mal con­tracts and with few pro­tec­tions when dis­putes arise.</p>
    <p>LO­GIS­TICS PRICE WAR</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the ma­jor lo­gis­tics com­pa­nies have been locked since last year in a spi­ralling price war. The com­pa­nies have tried to pass costs onto the fran­chises, which in turn have slashed the amount of money that couri­ers col­lect for each de­liv­ery, said Pro­fes­sor Lin Chengyi of Insead, an in­ter­na­tional busi­ness school based in France, who has stud­ied China’s gig econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Then came the virus. As cities locked down, many couri­ers were un­able to work, and fran­chises strug­gled to stay afloat. Some folded. Those that did re­open strug­gled to pay couri­ers even re­duced wages.</p>
    <p>That was what hap­pened to Mr</p>
    <p>Fang in Nan­jing. His lo­cal out­let of Best Ex­press, one of the ma­jor de­liv­ery com­pa­nies, did not is­sue US$30,000 in wages to eight work­ers as promised. Mr Fang said he was owed about US$3,000, the equiv­a­lent of four or five months’ pay.</p>
    <p>In July, the out­let owner promised to pay by Au­gust. Au­gust came and went. So the eight couri­ers, just un­der half of the sta­tion’s em­ploy­ees, went on strike. Not long af­ter, their boss van­ished. Mr Fang tried com­plain­ing to a higher-up in the com­pany. The com­pany of­fi­cial re­sponded that the dis­pute was not his re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Af­ter strik­ing for a month, Mr Fang de­cided to quit. He knew that it would be dif­fi­cult to find a new job, but it was still bet­ter than be­ing a courier. “There’s no money, there’s no labour con­tract, and de­fend­ing your rights is too dif­fi­cult,” he said.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Best Ex­press said the dis­pute over Mr Fang’s wages had been “mi­nor” and “swiftly re­solved”. She de­nied that the com­pany was ex­pe­ri­enc­ing strikes.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers told nearly iden­ti­cal sto­ries to Mr Fang. A courier in Shanghai told the lo­cal news me­dia last month that he had been hired just a week be­fore to help de­liver a half-month’s back­log of pack­ages, af­ter the fran­chise’s owner dis­ap­peared and the reg­u­lar couri­ers quit. Af­ter an­other owner dis­ap­peared in the east­ern city of Suzhou, couri­ers filed a po­lice re­port to re­cover more than US$15,000 in un­paid wages, so far to no avail.</p>
    <p>Mr Chau of China Labour Bulletin said that while work­ers may have en­dured a month or two of un­paid wages at first, given the pres­sures of the post-pan­demic econ­omy, that pos­ture had prob­a­bly be­come un­ten­able as de­lays dragged on.</p>
    <p>FEW LE­GAL PRO­TEC­TIONS</p>
    <p>They have few other av­enues for seek­ing help. The gov­ern­ment has grad­u­ally moved to sup­port work­ers in the ex­plod­ing e-com­merce industry, of­fi­cially recog­nis­ing “on­line de­liv­ery per­son” as a new oc­cu­pa­tion in March. Dur­ing last year’s Na­tional Day pa­rade, de­liv­ery driv­ers led the way.</p>
    <p>But le­gal pro­tec­tions re­main scarce, given the couri­ers’ lack of em­ploy­ment con­tracts and the dif­fi­culty in en­force­ment across such a scat­tered net­work, said labour law pro­fes­sor Tu Yongqian of Ren­min Uni­ver­sity in Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>The dis­persed and high-turnover na­ture of the industry also means that there is lit­tle com­mu­ni­ca­tion be­tween couri­ers at dif­fer­ent branches. Nor are in­de­pen­dent labour unions al­lowed in China. So the strikes that have un­folded in re­cent months have oc­curred in iso­la­tion, as prob­lems arise at each fran­chise. “This group of work­ers is very big, but they’ve never had the strength to form into an or­gan­i­sa­tion,” Prof Tu said.</p>
    <p>The lack of co­or­di­na­tion has prob­a­bly helped com­pa­nies to deny that any­thing is amiss. Xin­hua, the state-run news agency, pub­lished an ar­ti­cle last month call­ing re­ports of strikes “fake”, with un­named of­fi­cials at each com­pany declar­ing that op­er­a­tions were run­ning nor­mally.</p>
    <p>Still, as de­mand peaked be­fore Sin­gles’ Day, even the state news me­dia ac­knowl­edged some bumps. China Cen­tral Tele­vi­sion, the state broad­caster, aired a re­port on Tues­day about worker short­ages at courier com­pa­nies, though it did not men­tion strikes.</p>
    <p>Even couri­ers who are not strik­ing feel the rip­ple ef­fects of oth­ers’ protests. Mr Chen Zhongqiao, a courier in Wuhan, dropped off a pack­age at a check­point in Septem­ber that has still not reached its cus­tomer. Work­ers fur­ther down the line had not acted on it for weeks, ac­cord­ing to his track­ing in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Chen said he did not know whether he would be paid for com­plet­ing his part of the or­der, but his hopes were not high. He had come to his cur­rent em­ployer af­ter the last one dis­ap­peared.</p>
    <p>“We’ll have to see whether this branch can hang on,” he said. “If this one also col­lapses and the boss leaves, then judg­ing by pre­vi­ous ex­pe­ri­ence I again won’t get any money.”</p>
    <p>Alibaba, us­ing its own met­ric called gross mer­chan­dise value, said at the end of the event that Sin­gles’ Day sales across its platforms had to­talled US$74 bil­lion (S$100 bil­lion), nearly dou­ble last year’s record US$38.3 bil­lion, as China con­tin­ues to re­bound eco­nom­i­cally af­ter bring­ing its coro­n­avirus cases un­der con­trol.</p>
