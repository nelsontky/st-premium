    <p>NEW YORK Amer­i­can singer Johnny Nash – whose song I Can See Clearly Now reached No. 1 on the Bill­board charts in 1972, help­ing to bring reg­gae mu­sic to a main­stream Amer­i­can au­di­ence and over the years be­com­ing an an­them of op­ti­mism and re­newal – died on Tues­day at home in Hous­ton. He was 80.</p>
    <p>His son, John Nash III, con­firmed the death but did not spec­ify a cause.</p>
    <p>Nash was a singer, ac­tor and record-la­bel owner – and an early booster of reg­gae icon Bob Mar­ley – in a var­ied ca­reer that be­gan in the late 1950s when, as a teenager, he ap­peared on ra­dio and TV broad­caster Arthur God­frey’s CBS-TV va­ri­ety show. He also sang on God­frey’s pop­u­lar ra­dio broad­casts.</p>
    <p>Nash – who sang in a clear, smooth, emo­tive high-tenor voice – was signed to ABC-Paramount Records and first mar­keted as a crooner in the mould of singer Johnny Mathis.</p>
    <p>He recorded sev­eral al­bums of lushly or­ches­trated stan­dards, but they had only mod­est suc­cess.</p>
    <p>By 1965, he had formed his own la­bel, Joda Records, in part­ner­ship with his man­ager Danny Sims.</p>
    <p>That year, he scored a hit on the Bill­board R&B chart with Let’s Move And Groove (To­gether).</p>
    <p>It marked the be­gin­ning of a new phase of Nash’s ca­reer. When he trav­elled to Ja­maica to pro­mote</p>
    <p>Let’s Move, he be­came en­am­oured with the emerg­ing reg­gae sound. He recorded at Fed­eral Stu­dios in Kingston and, one night in 1967, met a young Mar­ley and heard him sing at a cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>Nash and Sims were so im­pressed that they signed Mar­ley and his group, the Wail­ers, to their la­bel – now called JAD – with the idea that he would write ma­te­rial for Nash to sing.</p>
    <p>Nash’s 1968 al­bum, Hold Me Tight, was the first to show­case his hy­brid pop-reg­gae sound. But it was his 1972 al­bum I Can See Clearly Now that was a true break­through both for him and for reg­gae in the United States. The al­bum in­cluded sev­eral songs writ­ten by Mar­ley, no­tably Stir It Up and Guava Jelly.</p>
    <p>But it was the ti­tle track, writ­ten by Nash, that had the big­gest im­pact. It spent four weeks atop the Bill­board Hot 100 sin­gles chart and, ac­cord­ing to re­viewer Ed Ho­gan of all­mu­sic.com, “did more to bring the reg­gae mu­sic sound into the main­stream than any other sin­gle record up to that point”.</p>
    <p>I Can See Clearly Now has since been recorded by, among many oth­ers, Ray Charles, Willie Nel­son, Hot­house Flow­ers and Jimmy Cliff.</p>
    <p>Nash was mar­ried three times. In ad­di­tion to his son, he is sur­vived by his wife Car­lie Nash and daughter Mon­ica Dixon.</p>
