    <p>When a coro­n­avirus vac­cine is fi­nally pro­duced, it is not likely to be avail­able in large quan­ti­ties, so the au­thor­i­ties may have to pri­ori­tise its dis­tri­bu­tion, the Health Min­istry’s di­rec­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices Ken­neth Mak said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He was re­spond­ing to a ques­tion on whether Sin­ga­pore had signed any sup­ply con­tracts for the vac­cines cur­rently un­der de­vel­op­ment, and whether such a vac­cine would be manda­tory for those liv­ing here.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Mak said dur­ing a multi-min­istry task force press con­fer­ence that the au­thor­i­ties had not yet de­cided whether the vac­cine would be manda­tory, and pointed out that there may be a lim­ited sup­ply when it is first made avail­able.</p>
    <p>“There will be many coun­tries want­ing to have ac­cess to these vac­cines, and the com­pa­nies will have to en­sure ac­cess for as many coun­tries as pos­si­ble,” he said.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the ini­tial stages of vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion will prob­a­bly see dif­fer­ent peo­ple be­ing pri­ori­tised, such as “vul­ner­a­ble pa­tient groups who would pos­si­bly have a higher risk of ad­verse out­comes, mor­bid­ity and even mor­tal­ity if they get in­fected with Covid-19”.</p>
    <p>Front-line work­ers car­ing for coro­n­avirus cases are also a likely pri­or­ity group, he said, adding that no fur­ther de­ci­sions on other pri­or­ity groups have been made at this point.</p>
    <p>An­other fac­tor is the type of vac­cine that is pro­duced, said Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong, who was also at the press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>As of Thurs­day, there were 30 vac­cines un­der­go­ing clin­i­cal tri­als around the world, with an­other 139 in pre-clin­i­cal stages.</p>
    <p>Most of these vac­cine can­di­dates re­quire dif­fer­ent doses to be ad­min­is­tered at dif­fer­ent tim­ings, and work through a va­ri­ety of meth­ods.</p>
    <p>“Some of these vac­cines may be suit­able for cer­tain groups of peo­ple, may be not suit­able for other groups of peo­ple. So how we de­ploy them will de­pend on the can­di­date vac­cine that is avail­able to us, and it also de­pends on the quan­tity that’s made avail­able,” said Mr Gan.</p>
    <p>He added that it is cur­rently too pre­ma­ture to talk about Sin­ga­pore’s vac­cine de­ploy­ment strat­egy as there are many fac­tors to be taken into con­sid­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“But I as­sure you that we are ac­tively pur­su­ing this front and also plan­ning our strat­egy, go­ing for­ward, as and when these vac­cines be­come avail­able,” he said.</p>
    <p>Prof Mak said that he could not share more in­for­ma­tion on which coun­tries or com­pa­nies Sin­ga­pore had signed con­tracts with for the vac­cine, due to agree­ments of con­fi­den­tial­ity.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he high­lighted that Sin­ga­pore is par­tic­i­pat­ing “quite ac­tively” in the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s Covax Fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>This fa­cil­ity aims to guar­an­tee rapid, fair and eq­ui­table ac­cess to a Covid-19 vac­cine for ev­ery coun­try re­gard­less of its fi­nan­cial sta­tus, amid con­cerns that the price of a vac­cine might be in­flated and it may be in­ac­ces­si­ble due to high de­mand.</p>
    <p>“We con­tinue to en­cour­age other like-minded coun­tries to par­tic­i­pate in this fa­cil­ity as well, with a view to­wards en­sur­ing that there’s ac­cess to vac­cines once they have com­pleted the var­i­ous tri­als and are deemed to be ef­fec­tive and safe. And we do pro­mote and en­cour­age greater ac­cess of the vac­cines for var­i­ous coun­tries rather than hav­ing to adopt a more pro­tec­tion­ist ap­proach,” said Prof Mak.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore now has one vac­cine can­di­date in the global race, Lu­narCov19, which is be­ing jointly devel­oped by Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School and United States phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics.</p>
    <p>Clin­i­cal tri­als for this vac­cine are un­der way here, with the first batch of lo­cal volunteers dosed ear­lier this month.</p>
