    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • With their sea­son on the brink and Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion ti­tle re­peat hopes in jeop­ardy, the Toronto Rap­tors out­fought the Bos­ton Celtics for a dra­matic se­ries-ty­ing 125-122 dou­ble-over­time win on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The re­sult en­sured their East­ern Con­fer­ence semi-fi­nal play-off se­ries will go to a Game 7.</p>
    <p>Kyle Lowry led the cham­pi­ons with 33 points and Nor­man Pow­ell added 23 off the bench in an emo­tional thriller that re­sem­bled the in­ten­sity of a heavy­weight box­ing match-up.</p>
    <p>“We play every pos­ses­sion like it’s our last and find ways to pull out vic­to­ries,” an ex­hausted Lowry said af­ter play­ing 53 min­utes.</p>
    <p>“That was two hard teams play­ing hard. Win or go home. Get it done. Don’t mat­ter who has to do it. Ready for Game 7.”</p>
    <p>Bos­ton got to within a point with 6.2 sec­onds re­main­ing, but Pow­ell sank two free throws and Mar­cus</p>
    <p>Smart missed a buzzer-beater from long range. But Jaylen Brown, who paced his team with 31 points, felt they would bounce back to­day.</p>
    <p>Said the Celtics for­ward: “We didn’t play as poised as we needed to down the stretch. We didn’t take care of the ball as well as we needed to. We had some turnovers that just killed us. Got to em­brace the chal­lenge. This is what ad­ver­sity is about. We have to give ev­ery­thing for Game 7.”</p>
    <p>In the West, the Los An­ge­les Clip­pers de­feated Den­ver 96-85 to seize a 3-1 edge over the Nuggets, giv­ing them the chance to ad­vance to the Con­fer­ence Fi­nals with a vic­tory to­day.</p>
    <p>While Fi­nals Most Valu­able Player Kawhi Leonard just missed his first ca­reer play-off triple-dou­ble, he sparked his team with 30 points, 11 re­bounds and nine as­sists.</p>
    <p>The Clip­pers have never reached the West Fi­nals since the fran­chise was founded in 1970, but are on the verge of end­ing 50 years of fu­til­ity.</p>
    <p>Leonard later called on his team­mates to “have the mind­set of play­ing every pos­ses­sion” if they are to close out their se­ries to­day.</p>
