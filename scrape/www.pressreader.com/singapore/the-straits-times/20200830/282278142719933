    <p>help stu­dents learn ab­stract math­e­mat­i­cal con­cepts in a con­crete way, un­like in a class­room, she had to use apps and on­line tools as re­place­ments.</p>
    <p>This meant spend­ing her days off fa­mil­iaris­ing her­self with them be­fore in­tro­duc­ing them dur­ing class. As the lines be­tween work and home life blurred, it felt “as if I was work­ing through­out” the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>She also took on the un­paid role of tech sup­port for grate­ful par­ents who were un­fa­mil­iar with com­put­ers, help­ing them out­side of her teach­ing hours.</p>
    <p>“Some even asked me, ‘Where is the Start but­ton?’” she says, chuck­ling.</p>
    <p>It was, how­ever, re­ward­ing to see her stu­dents ex­press them­selves freely dur­ing their ses­sions, as they could not do so dur­ing their school e-learn­ing classes, which tended to be more re­sults-driven.</p>
    <p>“They wanted to tell me how their week was, how stressed they were,” she ob­serves.</p>
    <p>Par­ents, on the other hand, were thank­ful for the DAS classes be­ful as it gives kids with learn­ing dif­fi­cul­ties “a chance to achieve and to have some­one be­lieve in them and en­cour­age them”.</p>
    <p>He draws par­al­lels be­tween his ex­pe­ri­ence with the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome epi­demic in 2003 and Covid-19 this year.</p>
    <p>“Back then, I was a stu­dent, so, hon­estly, it didn’t mat­ter to me. I was happy. You didn’t need to go to school, right?</p>
    <p>“But now, as a par­ent and as a work­ing adult, when the things we en­joy do­ing get taken away, I learnt cause “there is some­one mon­i­tor­ing the learn­ing and there are pep talks to keep the chil­dren mo­ti­vated and pos­i­tive through­out the cir­cuit breaker”.</p>
    <p>Her own quar­an­tine episode has taught her not to take good health for granted and never to shrug off flu-like symp­toms.</p>
    <p>At the same time, she re­alised that she had been miss­ing her own chil­dren’s mile­stones while busy cul­ti­vat­ing her stu­dents’ po­ten­tial.</p>
    <p>For one thing, she as­sumed that El­ham could read only a few words un­til he showed off his skills dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>“He was read­ing the whole book. I was amazed,” she re­counts with pride. “It was eye-open­ing for me, so now I try to spend as much time as I can with my own kids.”</p>
    <p>The best Teach­ers’ Day gift in this pan­demic year:</p>
    <p>“Stay in the pink of health, limit go­ing out as much as pos­si­ble and spend time with your family at home.” to trea­sure what mat­ters most, which is family time,” says Mr Wang, who de­scribes his wife as a “su­per­hero” for man­ag­ing their baby on her own.</p>
    <p>“I also found that my re­la­tion­ship with my chil­dren grew. There’s a closer bond.”</p>
    <p>The best Teach­ers’ Day gift in this pan­demic year:</p>
    <p>“I hope that my stu­dents won’t just go through this blindly, that they’ll be more re­silient and more ap­pre­cia­tive of the sim­ple things in life.”</p>
    <p>Ms Joyce Yeo, 31, was so busy run­ning her pi­ano stu­dio, JoyWaltzA­cademy, that she worked seven days a week.</p>
    <p>Her five-year-old so­cial en­ter­prise had taken over an ad­join­ing unit at Mid­town mall and was poised to open on April 1.</p>
    <p>The last pi­ano she or­dered ar­rived on March 25. The very next day, en­rich­ment cen­tres were forced to close un­der pan­demic safety mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Her most im­me­di­ate chal­lenge was trans­form­ing how the high-con­tact en­rich­ment genre was taught, as well as chang­ing mind­sets.</p>
    <p>“We were all not used to it. Pi­ano-play­ing is tra­di­tion­ally some­thing that you have to do phys­i­cally. A lot of par­ents didn’t be­lieve that we could ac­tu­ally do it on­line,” she re­calls.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, her teach­ers were as adept with lap­tops as they were with key­boards.</p>
    <p>Ms Yeo, who has a de­gree in bank­ing and fi­nance but chose to pur­sue her pas­sion for teach­ing, had de­signed a cur­ricu­lum for chil­dren as young as three.</p>
    <p>It is de­liv­ered via dig­i­tal re­sources so chil­dren would be able to learn the in­stru­ment in an age-ap­pro­pri­ate and en­gag­ing man­ner.</p>
    <p>Her school uses a com­pact roll pi­ano in­stru­ment that is af­ford­able and suit­able for home prac­tice.</p>
    <p>“The les­son ma­te­ri­als were al­ready on­line, so we could just share the screen with the chil­dren and watch them play. The dif­fi­culty was mainly with the tech­ni­cal is­sues,” she says, re­count­ing that her team had to help par­ents with Zoom hic­cups in the early days of the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>About 70 per cent of her 350-strong en­rol­ment sus­pended lessons dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, but those who chose on­line lessons “gave re­ally good re­views”, she says.</p>
    <p>Now that class­room lessons have re­sumed, most of her pre-cir­cuit breaker stu­dents are back, with about 10 per cent choos­ing to con­tinue e-learn­ing ex­clu­sively and some choos­ing a blend of on­line and class­room learn­ing.</p>
    <p>The new stu­dio ex­ten­sion came in handy as the extra space al­lowed her to ac­com­mo­date a 20 per cent in­crease in stu­dents to 430 to­day. She was also able to hire one new teacher from a mu­sic school that had closed down.</p>
    <p>JoyWaltzA­cademy’s pro­grammes at 25 pre-schools, lo­cal pri­mary schools and in­ter­na­tional in­sti­tu­tions were also sus­pended dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, with only eight re­sum­ing lessons so far in phase two.</p>
    <p>The three-month “forced rest” did her a lot of good, as she was so stressed ear­lier this year that she did not re­alise she was preg­nant un­til two months later in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Now in her third trimester, she had used the down time to do pre­na­tal yoga at home, walk her dog and en­joy the tasty clay­pot chicken that her hus­band Des­mond Chua, 34, who works for a tech­nol­ogy com­pany as head of Asia-Pa­cific, whips up.</p>
    <p>“I took it as a bless­ing even though there was all this stress about how the busi­ness was go­ing to sur­vive,” says the en­tre­pre­neur, who of­fers sub­sidised lessons to low-in­come chil­dren and em­ploys a hearing-im­paired staff mem­ber.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic’s dev­as­tat­ing ca­su­alty rate has made her re­assess her pri­or­i­ties even as she hands over work re­spon­si­bil­i­ties to con­cen­trate on her baby’s birth early next month.</p>
    <p>“No mat­ter how suc­cess­ful you are, when you don’t have your health and you don’t have peo­ple around you, it just doesn’t make any sense.”</p>
    <p>The best Teach­ers’ Day gift in this pan­demic year:</p>
    <p>“The kids al­ways give us cus­tomised bot­tles with our names. They’re so adorable when they give them to you be­cause they want you to be sur­prised and ex­cited.</p>
    <p>“But to us, (the best gift) is them be­ing safe, happy and healthy, and not re­strained by what’s go­ing on around them.”</p>
