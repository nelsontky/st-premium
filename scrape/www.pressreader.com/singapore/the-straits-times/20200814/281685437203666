    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • A Malaysian court jailed an In­dian na­tional for five months yesterday for vi­o­lat­ing a home quar­an­tine or­der which led to dozens of new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, the Ber­nama state news agency re­ported.</p>
    <p>Nezar Mo­hamed Sabur Batcha, 57, who re­sides i n Malaysia and owns a res­tau­rant in the north­ern state of Kedah, pleaded guilty to four charges of vi­o­lat­ing a man­dated 14-day home quar­an­tine or­der upon his re­turn from In­dia last month.</p>
    <p>He was also fined RM12,000 (S$3,925) by the Alor Se­tar Mag­is­trate’s Court, which held a spe­cial hear­ing at a Kedah hos­pi­tal where he was un­der­go­ing treat­ment, Ber­nama re­ported.</p>

    <p>After a sec­ond test came back pos­i­tive, dozens of peo­ple, in­clud­ing his fam­ily mem­bers, res­tau­rant work­ers and cus­tomers, were found to have been in­fected.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 45 cases linked to the clus­ter have since been re­ported in at least three Malaysian states – Kedah, Perlis and Pe­nang.</p>
    <p>Malaysia has grad­u­ally lifted strict lock­down mea­sures since May after suc­cess­fully con­tain­ing the spread of the pan­demic, but has warned that curbs may be reim­posed after more than a dozen new clus­ters emerged in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has re­ported 9,129 in­fec­tions, in­clud­ing 125 deaths.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties rein­tro­duced a re­quire­ment last month for peo­ple en­ter­ing the coun­try to un­dergo the manda­tory two-week quar­an­tine at ho­tels and gov­ern­ment iso­la­tion cen­tres, after hun­dreds of i ncom­ing trav­ellers were found vi­o­lat­ing or­ders to self-iso­late at home.</p>
