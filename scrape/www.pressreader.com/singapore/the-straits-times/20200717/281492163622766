    <p>Mov­ing on­line is the new fron­tier for brands and busi­nesses and the de­bil­i­tat­ing im­pact of Covid-19 has made the process only more ur­gent.</p>
    <p>Amid news of ma­jor re­tail clo­sures around the world, depart­ment stores, malls and other tra­di­tional re­tail­ers have been crit­i­cised for be­ing slow or clumsy to adapt dig­i­tally.</p>
    <p>This, how­ever, is chang­ing. In the past few months, play­ers in Sin­ga­pore have started to make the trek on­line too.</p>
    <p>In June, depart­ment store BHG Sin­ga­pore l aunched an e-com­merce store – the first in its 26-year his­tory.</p>
    <p>More than 170 home-grown and in­ter­na­tional brands were put on­line, in­clud­ing cos­met­ics, home and liv­ing prod­ucts, elec­tron­ics, kitchen­ware and toys.</p>
    <p>A dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion is the first phase in a three-year rein­ven­tion plan for the com­pany, said BHG’s chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer, Mr Jheeva Subra­ma­nian, in a press re­lease. “We see our e-com­merce store as our sixth store and be­lieve this launch blurs the lines of on­line and off­line shop­ping to cap­ture our cus­tomers’ at­ten­tion.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Robin­sons and Marks & Spencer, which al­ready had their own websites, went live with added store­fronts on e-com­merce plat­form Lazada in April.</p>
    <p>Shop­pers can browse au­then­ti­cated prod­ucts from each store’s as­sort­ment of brands via their LazMall stores.</p>
    <p>Re­tail­ers and con­sumers alike ben­e­fit from Lazada’s cam­paigns and sales through­out the year, says Lazada’s chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer, Mr James Chang.</p>
    <p>“While foot traf­fic to re­tail stores might take some time to re­sume, we have the ca­pa­bil­ity to host these mega sales, which will sup­port them in stay­ing rel­e­vant.”</p>
    <p>MORE JUMP­ING ON BOARD</p>
    <p>In­deed, many re­tail­ers are now team­ing up with third-party e-com­merce play­ers. The likes of Lazada, Qoo10 and Shopee re­port an in­creas­ing mi­gra­tion of tra­di­tional brick-and-mor­tar re­tail­ers onto their plat­forms.</p>
    <p>From Jan­uary to May this year, Lazada added eight times the num­ber of sell­ers it did in the same pe­riod last year, with depart­ment stores be­ing no­table ad­di­tions to the plat­form’s port­fo­lio.</p>
    <p>Along­side Robin­sons and Marks & Spencer, re­tail chains Pop­u­lar book­store and Mother­care also came on board in April.</p>
    <p>Qoo10 saw its rate of on­board­ing more than dou­ble from Jan­uary to June, com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>New re­tail­ers that joined in­clude cloth­ing brand Gior­dano, op­ti­cal re­tailer Capi­tol Op­ti­cal and lo­cal fish farm 75 Fish­ery.</p>
    <p>Mr Sam Too, gen­eral man­ager at Qoo10, at­tributes the trend partly to a gov­ern­ment grant by En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG).</p>
    <p>ESG launched the E-Com­merce</p>
    <p>Booster Pack­age in April, to help brick-and-mor­tar re­tail­ers and heart­land en­ter­prises di­ver­sify and reach new au­di­ences.</p>
    <p>The pack­age part­ners Ama­zon, Lazada Sin­ga­pore, Qoo10 and Shopee to sup­port el­i­gi­ble lo­cal re­tail­ers with a one-time grant.</p>
    <p>They can en­gage one of the four plat­forms to re­ceive help in ser­vices such as prod­uct pho­to­shoots and ad­ver­tis­ing.</p>
    <p>It has aided mer­chants who were new to on­line com­merce to cross “the first hur­dle”, says Mr Too.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore, many off­line re­tail­ers com­plained about their lack of dig­i­tal as­sets – well-de­signed thumb­nails and pro­fes­sional prod­uct im­ages,” he says, adding that Qoo10 rec­om­mends that brands in­clude three to five im­ages for ev­ery prod­uct.</p>
    <p>They also faced novel chal­lenges such as ad­just­ing their busi­ness op­er­a­tions to man­age of­fli­neon­line in­ven­tory, or­der ful­fil­ment and print­ing way­bills – doc­u­ments at­tached to parcels be­fore they are sent out for delivery.</p>
    <p>Out­side the grant, es­tab­lished brands with ex­ist­ing e-com­merce sites are more will­ing to ex­plore new on­line chan­nels now, in­clud­ing Face­book Live, he adds.</p>
    <p>Shopee echoed sim­i­lar ob­ser­va­tions.</p>
    <p>The plat­form de­clined to share num­bers, but says it “sup­ported a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of sell­ers in their shift to­wards a dig­i­tal-first busi­ness strat­egy” in this pe­riod.</p>
    <p>It brought on brands in­clud­ing City Chain Stores, Aldo, Con­verse, and Lee Hwa Jew­ellery.</p>
    <p>A lack of know-how is a ma­jor ob­sta­cle to dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion for most tra­di­tional re­tail­ers, says Shopee’s chief com­mer­cial of­fi­cer, Mr Zhou Jun­jie.</p>
    <p>“We en­sure sell­ers are on­boarded onto our plat­form as seam­lessly as pos­si­ble, through a range of sup­port pro­grammes, in­clud­ing a com­pre­hen­sive in­cu­ba­tion pro­gramme and lo­gis­tics sup­port de­signed to fa­cil­i­tate a quick and easy tran­si­tion onto Shopee,” adds Mr Zhou.</p>
    <p>Sell­ers on t he plat­form also ben­e­fit from reg­u­lar cam­paigns that spot­light brands – such as the Shopee Brands Fes­ti­val, which fea­tures daily deals on select brands and re­tail part­ners.</p>
    <p>For depart­ment store Metro, which part­nered Lazada in Novem­ber l ast year dur­ing the Black Fri­day sale, a first-mover ad­van­tage has paid off.</p>
    <p>Head of mar­ket­ing and mer­chan­dis­ing con­troller Erwin WuysangOei says the com­pany was well pre­pared for the pan­demic and cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Re­flect­ing on the head-start, he says: “Adopt­ing an om­nichan­nel and cus­tomer-cen­tric ap­proach seam­lessly syn­the­sises in­ter­de­pen­dent touch­points. For ex­am­ple, cus­tomers may want to see and touch a prod­uct at the store be­fore buy­ing it on­line as they do not want to carry it home.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter that, there is the con­ve­nience of ex­chang­ing prod­ucts they bought on LazMall at one of the Metro out­lets.</p>
    <p>“This year, daily traf­fic to our LazMall store tripled as a re­sult of evolv­ing shop­ping be­hav­iour.”</p>
    <p>CRE­AT­ING VIR­TUAL MALLS</p>
    <p>“Om­nichan­nel” may well be the new buzz­word in pan­demic-era re­tail. Be­yond just sell­ing on­line, some play­ers are find­ing new ways to lever­age e-com­merce and boost phys­i­cal sales too.</p>
    <p>This month, Ma­rina Square went on board Lazada as the plat­form’s first shop­ping mall, work­ing with its ten­ants to cre­ate a vir­tual mall on the app.</p>
    <p>More than 30 ten­ants have been taken on­board. How­ever, the only prod­ucts avail­able at present on the Ma­rina Square LazMall store are e-vouch­ers from ten­ants with­out LazMall stores – such as a $10 Zara voucher priced at $6, which shop­pers must re­deem in per­son.</p>
    <p>The e-vouch­ers aim to en­cour­age on­line pur­chases that could drive traf­fic back to re­tail stores, says Mr Chang. Once there, it might even lead to more in-per­son shop­ping at other brands in the mall.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers may want to see and touch a prod­uct at the store be­fore buy­ing it on­line as they do not want to carry it home. Af­ter that, there is the con­ve­nience of ex­chang­ing prod­ucts they bought on LazMall at one of the Metro out­lets. ’’</p>
    <p>MR ERWIN WUYSANG-OEI, Metro’s head of mar­ket­ing and mer­chan­dis­ing con­troller, on how adopt­ing an om­nichan­nel and cus­tomer-cen­tric ap­proach seam­lessly syn­the­sises in­ter­de­pen­dent touch­points</p>
    <p>Al­though not new, the con­cept of dig­i­tal goods – prod­ucts trans­acted dig­i­tally that can take the form of vouch­ers, gift cards and cred­its – has taken off dur­ing Covid-19, says Mr Chang.</p>
    <p>Sales of e-vouch­ers last month tripled that of Fe­bru­ary’s, while traf­fic to such mer­chants quadru­pled.</p>
    <p>The part­ner­ship with Ma­rina Square is “a unique one”, he adds.</p>
    <p>“For ten­ants with ex­ist­ing LazMall stores, the Ma­rina Square LazMall page serves as a traf­fic driver to those pages and show­cases prod­ucts from them. For those with­out (such as fash­ion la­bels Zara and Mas­simo Dutti), the LazMall store sells e-vouch­ers that can be re­deemed within Ma­rina Square.</p>
    <p>“This on­line-to-off­line strat­egy can help pro­vide im­me­di­ate cash flow for ten­ants, while driv­ing cus­tomers back to their phys­i­cal stores as we tran­si­tion into phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing.”</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, pri­ori­tis­ing om­nichan­nel re­tail, Cap­i­ta­Land chose to fly solo with its own e-com­merce plat­forms.</p>
    <p>The re­tail land­lord launched two dig­i­tal plat­forms on June 1 – eCap­i­taMall that fo­cuses on goods and ser­vices from its ten­ants; and foodor­der­ing plat­form Capi­ta3Eats.</p>
    <p>Since launch­ing, both plat­forms have signed on more than 280 on­line mer­chants com­bined from Cap­i­ta­Land’s net­work of malls, which in­cludes Junc­tion 8 and Raf­fles City Shop­ping Cen­tre, and are on track to get on board 500 on­line mer­chants by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>Mr Chris Chong, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Cap­i­ta­Land re­tail in Sin­ga­pore, says: “The twin dig­i­tal plat­forms help our re­tail­ers reach out to more con­sumers and ac­cess on­line busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties 24/7. This com­ple­ments re­tail­ers’ phys­i­cal store sales and helps to ex­pand their on­line pres­ence.”</p>
    <p>Shop­pers ben­e­fit from the con­ve­nience of be­ing able to browse on­line first and plan their shop­ping trips in ad­vance. They can also earn and spend loy­alty points via the Cap­i­taS­tar app.</p>
    <p>Mr Chong adds: “The points earned on eCap­i­taMall and Capi­ta3Eats can be used in Cap­i­ta­Land malls and vice versa, cre­at­ing a virtuous cir­cle of on­line and off­line spend­ing in Cap­i­ta­Land’s re­tail ecosys­tem.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing on­line also means they are not re­stricted to mer­chants from one mall, but can now shop from all the malls in our phys­i­cal net­work.”</p>
    <p>Of the mas­sive ef­fort, he notes that Cap­i­ta­Land has been ad­vo­cat­ing om­nichan­nel re­tail for a num­ber of years, but had to man­age ten­ants who “were slower in in­cor­po­rat­ing a dig­i­tal strat­egy into their busi­ness mod­els, per­haps due to a lack of dig­i­tal ca­pa­bil­i­ties or im­pe­tus to do so”.</p>
    <p>“With Covid-19, the shift to­wards om­nichan­nel re­tail has ac­cel­er­ated,” he says, adding that Cap­i­ta­Land plans to launch its first livestream “shop­per­tain­ment” show in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>As for Ma­rina Square, it was Lazada’s “in­tu­itive user in­ter­face” and ex­pe­ri­ence as an e-com­merce plat­form in South-east Asia that led the mall to part­ner them, says a spokesman for the mall.</p>
    <p>“Lazada seemed like a good match to com­ple­ment our brand, given its strong cus­tomer base, in­clud­ing shopa­holics and bar­gain hunters who are at­tracted to vouch­ers and flash deals.</p>
    <p>“Lever­ag­ing on their plat­form al­lows us to see eye to eye on fun­da­men­tals such as en­sur­ing con­sumers en­joy a pleas­ant and smooth shop­ping ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>House­wife Ang Siew Hoon, 43, likes the op­tions she now has.</p>
    <p>“I do my shop­ping at Metro when it has a sale. Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, I needed a new pot, but the malls were closed. I saw a set on pro­mo­tion at the Metro store on Lazada dur­ing the re­cent mid-year fes­ti­val sale and bought it. I re­ceived it within two days and I didn’t even have to l eave the house.”</p>
    <p>Oth­ers, like Madam Teo Keng Eng, 58, are still hes­i­tant about shop­ping at old-school re­tail­ers on apps.</p>
    <p>The of­fice ad­min­is­tra­tor, who was en­ticed by a sale and re­cently made a trip to Robin­sons, says: “I’m open to shop­ping via Lazada dur­ing the mem­bers-only sales, but only if the vouch­ers work and if there are more pho­tos of the prod­ucts to see.”</p>
