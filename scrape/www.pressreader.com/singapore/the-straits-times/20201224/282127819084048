    <p>A man used un­reg­u­lated pri­vate­hire car ser­vices such as Ride Kakis and SG Hitch on mes­sag­ing plat­form Tele­gram to scour for po­ten­tial vic­tims.</p>
    <p>Muham­mad Hafiz Mak­sah, 27, duped three women into be­liev­ing that he would trans­port them to their destinatio­ns and drove them in­stead to se­cluded places where he mo­lested them.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to five years and 10 months’ jail with six strokes of the cane af­ter plead­ing guilty to three mo­lesta­tion charges in­volv­ing three women.</p>
    <p>A mo­lesta­tion charge linked to a fourth vic­tim and one count of crim­i­nal in­tim­i­da­tion were taken into con­sid­er­a­tion dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Hafiz, who is no longer a pri­vate-hire driver, picked up one of the vic­tims, a 20-year-old woman, in Jurong at around 7am on Oct 12 last year.</p>
    <p>He was sup­posed to drive her home to Cle­menti but then lied to her, claim­ing that he had to make a de­tour to re­turn the house keys of a friend. He drove to a mul­ti­storey carpark in Jurong West Street 42.</p>
    <p>He then sug­gested to the woman that they play a card game while wait­ing for the “friend” to come, and she agreed. She was told to per­form for­feits if she lost.</p>
    <p>As one of the for­feits, Hafiz told her to kiss his lips but she re­fused.</p>
    <p>The woman got out of the car but did not leave the area as he had taken her mo­bile phone. She was also not fa­mil­iar with the neigh­bour­hood, the court heard.</p>
    <p>She later found a piece of glass and used it to in­jure her right wrist in an at­tempt to con­vince Hafiz to let her go.</p>
    <p>When he failed to re­act, the dis­tressed woman tried to climb over a ledge to get away. Hafiz then grabbed her right arm and pulled her back to his ve­hi­cle.</p>
    <p>He also locked the doors of his ve­hi­cle to pre­vent the woman from get­ting away as he planned to have sex with her.</p>
    <p>In her dis­tress, the woman be­gan de­lib­er­ately hurt­ing her­self. She burnt her left hand with a cig­a­rette lighter and banged her head against the car win­dow.</p>
    <p>Hafiz told the woman that he wanted to have sex with her but she re­buffed his ad­vances. Af­ter some time, he asked her to lick his toes to “clear the for­feits” and she agreed. He then mo­lested her.</p>
    <p>Hafiz fi­nally drove out of the carpark at around 10.20am. She reached home at around 11am and alerted the po­lice.</p>
    <p>In an­other in­ci­dent, he picked up a 21-year-old woman at around 7.15pm on Oct 11 last year and mo­lested her in a Cir­cuit Road carpark.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, he drove an­other 21-year-old woman to Jalan Inggu near Sem­bawang Park in the wee hours of March 16 this year and mo­lested her.</p>
