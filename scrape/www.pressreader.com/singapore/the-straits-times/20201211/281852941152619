    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Pres­i­dent Donald Trump and 17 US states are sup­port­ing a l ong-shot l aw­suit by Texas seek­ing to over­turn his elec­tion loss by ask­ing the US Supreme Court to throw out the vot­ing re­sults in four states.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump filed a mo­tion with the court on Wed­nes­day ask­ing the nine jus­tices to let him in­ter­vene and be­come a plain­tiff in the suit filed on Tues­day by Repub­li­can-gov­erned Texas against Ge­or­gia, Michi­gan, Penn­syl­va­nia and Wis­con­sin.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump had lost to Mr Biden in those four bat­tle­ground states which con­trib­uted a com­bined 62 elec­toral votes to the 306 that Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Biden won.</p>
    <p>With­out pre­sent­ing any ev­i­dence, the law­suit claimed that Mr Trump won 12 mil­lion more votes than in 2016 and that there was a high per­cent­age of non-white vot­ers this time.</p>
    <p>It also ar­gued that the states’ de­ci­sions to ex­pand mail-in vot­ing were un­law­ful.</p>
    <p>If the jus­tices let Mr Trump join the law­suit, it would cre­ate the ex­tra­or­di­nary cir­cum­stance of a sit­ting US pres­i­dent ask­ing the top Amer­i­can court to de­cide that the mil­lions of votes cast in the four states did not count.</p>
    <p>Writ­ing on Twit­ter, Mr Trump said: “This is the big one. Our Coun­try needs a vic­tory!”</p>
    <p>The law­suit, the lat­est in a se­ries of elec­tion chal­lenges brought by Mr Trump’s cam­paign and sup­port­ers that so far have failed in nu­mer­ous courts, was ini­ti­ated by Mr Ken Pax­ton, the Repub­li­can at­tor­ney-gen­eral of Texas and an ally of the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>The states join­ing Texas are: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, In­di­ana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mis­sis­sippi, Mis­souri, Mon­tana, Ne­braska, North Dakota, Ok­la­homa, South Carolina, South Dakota, Ten­nessee, Utah and West Vir­ginia. All of the states were rep­re­sented by Repub­li­can of­fi­cials in the fil­ing. All but three of the states have Repub­li­can gov­er­nors.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials from Ge­or­gia, Michi­gan, Penn­syl­va­nia and Wis­con­sin have called the lat­est law­suit a public­ity stunt.</p>
    <p>“The mo­tion filed by the Texas at­tor­ney-gen­eral is a public­ity stunt, not a se­ri­ous le­gal plead­ing,” Michi­gan At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Dana Nes­sel said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“The ero­sion of con­fi­dence in our demo­cratic sys­tem isn’t at­trib­ut­able to the good peo­ple of Michi­gan, Wis­con­sin, Ge­or­gia or Penn­syl­va­nia but rather to par­ti­san of­fi­cials, like Mr Pax­ton, who place loy­alty to a per­son over loy­alty to their coun­try.”</p>
    <p>Late on Tues­day, Repub­li­can Se­na­tor of Texas Ted Cruz agreed to ar­gue the case at the Pres­i­dent’s re­quest, ac­cord­ing to a per­son fa­mil­iar with their con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said the Texas law­suit stands lit­tle chance of suc­cess.</p>
    <p>“Both pro­ce­du­rally and sub­stan­tively, it’s a mess,” Dr Justin Le­vitt, an elec­tion law pro­fes­sor at Loy­ola Law School in Cal­i­for­nia, said of the Texas law­suit.</p>
    <p>“There’s zero chance the court agrees to take the case.”</p>
