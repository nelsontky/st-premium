    <p>WASH­ING­TON US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has an­nounced a peace deal be­tween Is­rael and Bahrain, which be­comes the sec­ond Arab coun­try to set­tle with its for­mer foe over the past month, re­in­forc­ing an am­bi­tious White House push to re­draw the con­flicts of the Mid­dle East.</p>
    <p>Call­ing it a “truly his­toric day”, Mr Trump said Is­rael and Bahrain were es­tab­lish­ing full diplo­matic and com­mer­cial re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>“They will ex­change em­bassies and am­bas­sadors, be­gin di­rect flights be­tween their coun­tries and launch co­op­er­a­tion ini­tia­tives across a broad range of sec­tors, in­clud­ing health, business, tech­nol­ogy, education, se­cu­rity and agri­cul­ture,” he told re­porters on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Bahrain said in a joint state­ment that it had agreed to for­malise the deal with Is­rael at a White House event on Tues­day. The United Arab Emi­rates is also ex­pected to ink its own peace deal with Is­rael, an­nounced in the mid­dle of last month, at the White House.</p>
    <p>The state­ment said Bahrain’s King Ha­mad, Is­raeli Prime Min­is­ter Ben­jamin Ne­tanyahu and Mr Trump talked ear­lier on Fri­day be­fore an­nounc­ing the deal.</p>
    <p>Bahrain said that dur­ing the phone call, the King “stressed the need to reach a just and com­pre­hen­sive peace as a strate­gic op­tion, in ac­cor­dance with the twostate so­lu­tion and rel­e­vant res­o­lu­tions of in­ter­na­tional le­git­i­macy”.</p>
    <p>A se­nior of­fi­cial in the Bahraini cap­i­tal Manama said the deal would boost re­gional “se­cu­rity, sta­bil­ity, pros­per­ity”.</p>
    <p>Un­til now, Is­rael has been able to strike just two peace ac­cords with Arab coun­tries – Egypt in 1979 and Jor­dan in 1994 – and Mr Trump is hop­ing the diplo­matic suc­cesses will give him badly needed mo­men­tum go­ing into the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>In Jerusalem, Mr Ne­tanyahu hailed the agree­ment, say­ing: “Cit­i­zens of Is­rael, I am moved to be able to tell you that this evening, we are reach­ing an­other peace agree­ment with an­other Arab coun­try, Bahrain. This agree­ment adds to the his­toric peace with the United Arab Emi­rates.”</p>
    <p>Over in the UAE, Ms Hend alO­taiba, di­rec­tor of strate­gic com­mu­ni­ca­tions at the For­eign Min­istry, sent con­grat­u­la­tions to Bahrain and Is­rael.</p>
    <p>“To­day marks an­other sig­nif­i­cant and his­toric achieve­ment which will con­trib­ute enor­mously to the sta­bil­ity and pros­per­ity of the re­gion,” she said.</p>
    <p>But Pales­tini­ans, who see Arab sup­port as cru­cial to their lim­ited power in re­sist­ing Is­raeli oc­cu­pa­tion, quickly con­demned the Is­rael-Bahrain deal as well.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment is “a stab in the back of the Palestinia­n cause and the Palestinia­n peo­ple”, said Dr Ah­mad Ma­j­dalani, Social De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter in the West Bankbased Palestinia­n Author­ity.</p>
    <p>Bahrain said that dur­ing the phone call, King Ha­mad “stressed the need to reach a just and com­pre­hen­sive peace as a strate­gic op­tion, in ac­cor­dance with the two-state so­lu­tion and rel­e­vant res­o­lu­tions of in­ter­na­tional le­git­i­macy”.</p>
