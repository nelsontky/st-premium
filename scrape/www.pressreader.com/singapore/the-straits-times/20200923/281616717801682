    <p>With the care­ful re­lax­ation of travel re­stric­tions and more green lanes al­low­ing es­sen­tial and busi­ness travel, Sin­ga­pore is keep­ing a close eye on im­ported cases and mak­ing sure they do not leak into the com­mu­nity. Clara Chong looks at the dif­fer­ent ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>Strict mea­sures in place for hard-hit places</p>
    <p>In Europe, the num­ber of new Covid-19 cases has been ris­ing rapidly. For in­stance, France reported more than 10,000 new cases on Sun­day while Bri­tain reported al­most 4,000 cases on the same day. Coun­tries like Italy saw close to 1,000 new in­fec­tions and Ger­many reported 1,345 new cases on Sun­day as well.</p>
    <p>Given the sever­ity of the pan­demic in some coun­tries, vis­i­tors from these places will have to serve a 14-day quar­an­tine at ded­i­cated gov­ern­ment fa­cil­i­ties and take a poly­merase chain re­ac­tion swab test prior to the end of their quar­an­tine pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Brunei and New Zealand</p>
    <p>On Sin­ga­pore’s end, gen­eral travel to Brunei and New Zealand has been al­lowed from this month, though peo­ple here can­not travel to ei­ther coun­try un­til re­stric­tions are lifted there. Sin­ga­pore is al­low­ing vis­i­tors from these two coun­tries, with­out the need for a 14-day stay-home pe­riod or quar­an­tine if they had re­mained in the two coun­tries for the past 14 con­sec­u­tive days prior to their visit to Sin­ga­pore, as the virus sit­u­a­tion in those places is well un­der con­trol. These vis­i­tors en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore come un­der the Air Travel Pass Scheme, which al­lows for all forms of short-term travel, in­clud­ing leisure travel. Vis­i­tors from these two coun­tries will have to take a swab test upon ar­rival and will be able to go about their ac­tiv­i­ties af­ter they get a neg­a­tive test re­sult. They will have to use the TraceTo­gether app for the du­ra­tion of their stay here, among other con­di­tions. 1. Ja­pan (from Sept 18) The Busi­ness Track al­lows for safe re­sump­tion of cross-border travel and busi­ness ex­changes, with nec­es­sary pub­lic health safe­guards, such as test­ing be­fore trav­ellers leave, and af­ter they ar­rive, and ad­her­ing to a con­trolled itin­er­ary for the first 14 days on ar­rival.</p>
    <p>2. China (from June 8) Vis­i­tors from China – the first coun­try to es­tab­lish a green lane with Sin­ga­pore – need not serve a quar­an­tine of up to 14 days but must un­dergo Covid-19 swab tests. This ap­plies to six prov­inces: Shang­hai, Tian­jin, Chongqing, Guang­dong, Jiangsu and Zhe­jiang. The ar­range­ment will be grad­u­ally ex­panded to other Chi­nese prov­inces and mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>3. South Korea (from Sept 4) Con­di­tions in­clude pre-de­par­ture and post-ar­rival test­ing, as well as the need to ad­here to a con­trolled itin­er­ary for the first 14 days af­ter trav­ellers’ ar­rival.</p>
    <p>4. Malaysia (from Aug 17 ) Sin­ga­pore opened its bor­ders to Malaysia un­der two schemes – the Re­cip­ro­cal Green Lane and the Pe­ri­odic Com­mut­ing Ar­range­ment. The Re­cip­ro­cal Green Lane fa­cil­i­tates cross-border travel for es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial pur­poses be­tween both coun­tries while the Pe­ri­odic Com­mut­ing Ar­range­ment al­lows Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia res­i­dents who hold long-term im­mi­gra­tion passes for busi­ness and work pur­poses in the other coun­try to pe­ri­od­i­cally re­turn to their home coun­tries for short-term home leave.</p>
    <p>5. Brunei</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is hav­ing dis­cus­sions with places in­clud­ing:</p>
    <p>1. In­done­sia Both coun­tries said on Aug 25 that dis­cus­sions will start on green lane ar­range­ments to re­sume es­sen­tial of­fi­cial and busi­ness travel.</p>
    <p>2. Thai­land</p>
    <p>Both coun­tries have agreed to speed up dis­cus­sions on set­ting up a re­cip­ro­cal green lane, Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs said on Aug 26.</p>
    <p>3. Hong Kong</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Con­sulate-Gen­eral in Hong Kong said on Sept 10 that the Repub­lic wel­comes talks with Hong Kong on the grad­ual re­sump­tion of cross-border travel be­tween the two sides.</p>
