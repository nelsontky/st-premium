    <p>A hit-and-run saga in­volv­ing the scion of one of Thai­land’s rich­est fam­i­lies has turned into a po­lit­i­cal hot potato for Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha.</p>
    <p>At least three high-level com­mit­tees have been formed to ex­am­ine how all charges came to be dropped against Mr Vo­rayuth Yoovid­hya, whose Fer­rari slammed into a mo­tor­cy­cle in Bangkok in 2012 and killed a po­lice­man, Mr Wichean Klun­prasert. Al­though Mr Vo­rayuth faced three charges ini­tially, the first two ex­pired be­cause he evaded the au­thor­i­ties and fled the king­dom in 2017.</p>
    <p>The last and most se­ri­ous charge of reck­less driv­ing was dropped by pros­e­cu­tors in June, trig­ger­ing pub­lic out­rage.</p>
    <p>Mr Vo­rayuth, 35, is the son of Mr Chalerm Yoovid­hya, whose clan owns about half of the Red Bull en­ergy drink em­pire. The ex­tended fam­ily, the sec­ond wealth­i­est in the coun­try, is worth US$20.2 bil­lion (S$27.7 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>For Thais laid low by the coro­n­avirus pandemic and fac­ing dim job prospects, Mr Vo­rayuth’s case be­came a stun­ning sym­bol of in­equal­ity. Pub­lic fury fol­low­ing the drop­ping of charges forced the po­lice and the of­fice of the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral to set up pan­els to ex­am­ine their own con­duct.</p>
    <p>The House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives com­mit­tee on le­gal af­fairs, jus­tice and hu­man rights has be­gun grilling of­fi­cials in­volved in this case, and Mr Prayut con­vened his own fact-find­ing com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>Then a key wit­ness in the case died last week. Po­lice said it looked like a traf­fic ac­ci­dent. Amid al­le­ga­tions of a cover-up, Mr Prayut has or­dered a sec­ond au­topsy on the wit­ness’ body.</p>
    <p>“This is prob­a­bly the first case where the prime min­is­ter has ap­pointed such a com­mit­tee in re­sponse to a pub­lic out­cry,” Dr Pa­reena Sri­vanit, dean of Chu­la­longkorn Univer­sity’s law school and a mem­ber of Mr</p>
    <p>Prayut’s panel, told The Straits Times. “It’s a demon­stra­tion of ‘peo­ple power’.”</p>
    <p>But she ac­knowl­edged that her team could not de­ter­mine the out­come of the case. It could only lay bare po­lice and pros­e­cu­tors’ con­duct and rec­om­mend sys­temic changes.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, the panel in the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s of­fice said it would rec­om­mend that Mr Vo­rayuth’s case be re­opened for po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>For now, Thais who grew up watch­ing the rich buy their way out of the sys­tem are re­fus­ing to ease off on their de­mand for an­swers.</p>
    <p>Mr Vo­rayuth’s case fanned dis­con­tent al­ready sparked by eco­nomic mis­ery. Even be­fore the Covid-19 pandemic, Thai­land’s rich­est 10 per cent owned 76.6 per cent of the king­dom’s wealth, in part due to the oli­garchic eco­nomic struc­ture. Ris­ing job losses and loom­ing un­em­ploy­ment among grad­u­ates are now mak­ing elite priv­i­lege a lot more un­palat­able.</p>
    <p>“The po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic elite are sus­pi­cious of elec­toral democ­racy, and sup­port mil­i­tary in­ter­ven­tions that pre­serve the oli­garchic sta­tus quo,” wrote the In­ter­na­tional Cri­sis Group in a re­port re­leased this week.</p>
    <p>Young peo­ple have staged demon­stra­tions, which have grown, in re­cent weeks. They have broached even erst­while taboo top­ics like Thai­land’s pow­er­ful monar­chy. It is not sur­pris­ing then, that pro­test­ers have seized upon Mr Vo­rayuth’s case as a glar­ing ex­am­ple of gov­ern­ment cor­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>“It’s about the tim­ing of the case. Red Bull is per­haps the last straw,” said Dr Napisa Waitoolkia­t, dean of Nare­suan Univer­sity’s so­cial sci­ences fac­ulty. “The Red Bull case re­flects (the en­ti­tle­ments of) young elite busi­ness­men who come from high so­ci­ety and whose fam­i­lies are closely linked to those in power.”</p>
    <p>While Mr Prayut has been able to eas­ily brush off ear­lier al­le­ga­tions of gov­ern­ment cor­rup­tion and mis­con­duct since he be­came Prime Min­is­ter in 2014, pre­vail­ing po­lit­i­cal con­di­tions make the Red Bull case trick­ier, said ob­servers.</p>
    <p>“If the gov­ern­ment does not do any­thing about it, so­ci­ety will say it is try­ing to pro­tect this fam­ily,” said leg­is­la­tor Rangsi­man Rome, who is also spokesman for the House com­mit­tee on le­gal af­fairs, jus­tice and hu­man rights.</p>
    <p>“If the gov­ern­ment doesn’t han­dle this case fairly enough, it could be­come an is­sue.”</p>
    <p>For Thais laid low by the coro­n­avirus pandemic and fac­ing dim job prospects, Mr Vo­rayuth’s case be­came a stun­ning sym­bol of in­equal­ity. Pub­lic fury fol­low­ing the drop­ping of charges forced the po­lice and the of­fice of the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral to set up pan­els to ex­am­ine their own con­duct.</p>
