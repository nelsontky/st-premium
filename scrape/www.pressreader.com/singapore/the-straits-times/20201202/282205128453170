    <p>A male pri­mary school teacher is ac­cused of com­mit­ting in­de­cent acts on a 14-year-old girl last year.</p>
    <p>Micky Ng Chee Siong, 38, whose case was last heard in a district court on Nov 12, faces three charges un­der the Chil­dren and Young Per­sons Act.</p>
    <p>There is no gag or­der on the Sin­ga­porean’s iden­tity even though there is one on the girl.</p>
    <p>Court documents do not state how they got to know each other.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment to The Straits Times on Mon­day, the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) said Ng has been sus­pended from duty since Au­gust last year when the po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tion started.</p>
    <p>Its spokesman added: “MOE takes a se­ri­ous view of staff mis­con­duct and will not hes­i­tate to take dis­ci­plinary ac­tion against those who fail to ad­here to our stan­dards of con­duct and dis­ci­pline, in­clud­ing dis­missal from ser­vice.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court documents, Ng al­legedly kissed the girl’s lips while in a car along Up­per Thom­son Road in early April last year.</p>
    <p>He is also ac­cused of touch­ing and kiss­ing her up­per body some­time be­tween April and June last year.</p>
    <p>Ng is said to have com­mit­ted sim­i­lar acts on the teenager on June 3 last year.</p>
    <p>It was not stated how his al­leged of­fences came to light.</p>
    <p>Ng’s bail has been set at $15,000 and he must not con­tact the girl as part of his bail con­di­tions. He must also not have any con­tact with the pros­e­cu­tion wit­nesses.</p>
    <p>The case has been ad­journed to Dec 10.</p>
    <p>For each charge, a first-time of­fender con­victed of com­mit­ting an in­de­cent act on a mi­nor can be jailed for up to five years and fined up to $10,000.</p>
    <p>A re­peat of­fender can be jailed for up to seven years and fined up to $20,000.</p>
