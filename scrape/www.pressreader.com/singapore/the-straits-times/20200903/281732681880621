    <p>In a charged de­bate, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong crossed swords with Leader of the Op­po­si­tion Pri­tam Singh on the is­sue of en­cour­ag­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans to vote for the op­po­si­tion, with the as­sur­ance that the PAP would still form the gov­ern­ment of the day.</p>
    <p>Any po­lit­i­cal party that does so is what econ­o­mists would call a “free rider” and this tac­tic will even­tu­ally re­sult in the sys­tem fail­ing, PM Lee said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Stress­ing that elec­tions are about vot­ing for who will run the gov­ern­ment, he added that the coun­try’s po­lit­i­cal sys­tem can work only if peo­ple vote “sin­cerely, hon­estly, in ac­cor­dance with what they re­ally want”.</p>
    <p>But the Work­ers’ Party (WP) chief coun­tered that the res­i­dents of Hougang, as well as Alju­nied and Sengkang GRCs – where his party emerged vic­to­ri­ous in the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion – are “not free rid­ers” and that MPs in these ar­eas work hard to prove their worth.</p>
    <p>Their ex­change fol­lowed a speech by PM Lee in which he de­tailed why it is cru­cial for Sin­ga­pore to get its pol­i­tics right.</p>
    <p>In it, he re­lated how a mid­dleaged woman ap­proached Se­nior Minister Teo Chee Hean dur­ing the elec­tion cam­paign. The woman had asked Mr Teo if it was true that vot­ing for the op­po­si­tion would just mean “two per­sons work­ing for you in­stead of one”, as the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party’s (PAP) plans for the area would still get car­ried out, he said.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to this anec­dote, Mr</p>
    <p>Singh said there is an­other per­spec­tive, cit­ing how he has been asked why the elected op­po­si­tion MP does not fea­ture in the area’s com­mu­nity club.</p>
    <p>Vot­ers who say that they want the PAP in gov­ern­ment, but also want an op­po­si­tion in Par­lia­ment, are giv­ing voice to what many Sin­ga­pore­ans feel, Mr Singh said.</p>
    <p>His duty, and that of his fel­low MPs, is to be responsibl­e about their roles, he added.</p>
    <p>“It is not easy, we come un­der pres­sure too from our own sup­port­ers. But as the Prime Minister rightly said, I think we owe our loy­alty to some­thing larger. And we will do our best by Sin­ga­pore­ans. And if we are not good enough, we de­serve to be voted out. And that is how the sys­tem should work.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee replied that the Non-Con­stituency MP (NCMP) scheme guar­an­tees that there will be op­po­si­tion MPs in Par­lia­ment to hold the PAP to ac­count.</p>
    <p>If peo­ple be­lieve that the PAP gov­ern­ment is do­ing the wrong thing, it should be voted out, he said. But if Sin­ga­pore­ans vote “tac­ti­cally”, one day they will get a re­sult they did not in­tend.</p>
    <p>“I think that is a wrong thing to teach peo­ple to do. You go to the elec­tions, you vote for the per­son whom you have trust in, who will run your sys­tem, who will run your gov­ern­ment,” PM Lee said, crit­i­cis­ing these “free rider” tac­tics.</p>
    <p>“And our sys­tem is de­signed so that if you do that, it will be sta­ble. If you don’t do that... you are court­ing trou­ble.”</p>
    <p>He added that he un­der­stands why Mr Singh has cho­sen to play up</p>
    <p>the mes­sage that vot­ers can safely vote for his party, given that the PAP will still form the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“But I put it to you that that is not the right thing to do morally, and is not the right thing to do for Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing, Mr Singh said the WP MPs had their “grow­ing pains” but have tried their best in the cir­cum­stances they were in, and would not be in Par­lia­ment to­day if they were bungling things up.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents voted for the WP be­cause they know that hav­ing elected op­po­si­tion MPs is ul­ti­mately good for Sin­ga­pore, he said.</p>
    <p>“It is not just the NCMP ver­sion of the op­po­si­tion – with full re­spect to ev­ery­one who is an NCMP in this Par­lia­ment and those that came be­fore. It is when you have elected op­po­si­tion MPs that the Gov­ern­ment lis­tens harder, and that means some­thing to peo­ple. That is my view.”</p>
    <p>Tak­ing on the Prime Minister’s sug­ges­tion that his tac­tics were dis­hon­est, Mr Singh said: “The big­ger moral im­per­a­tive that I have, and it is a huge bur­den... was whether the peo­ple who are stand­ing as can­di­dates could fol­low through.”</p>
    <p>This was the heav­i­est de­ci­sion he had to make, as the “big­gest pain” would be to choose some­one who turns out not to be com­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>He added: “I am not des­per­ate for power, Prime Minister, but we have got to get good peo­ple if we want to bring this coun­try for</p>
    <p>ward... At this point in our growth, I think, we have to grow our roots as a loyal op­po­si­tion.”</p>
    <p>This is the first time that the Gov­ern­ment has recog­nised the of­fice of the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion, he noted. “We have many, many more miles to go, but we are not chas­ing a des­ti­na­tion. We in­tend to do right by Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee ac­knowl­edged Mr Singh’s emo­tional dec­la­ra­tion in his re­sponse, but stood by his ear­lier point.</p>
    <p>“I ap­pre­ci­ate Mr Pri­tam’s ex­pla­na­tions. I, in no way, un­der­value his mo­ti­va­tions, his pas­sion, his de­sire to do right by Sin­ga­pore, his wish to have a higher-qual­ity op­po­si­tion built up in Sin­ga­pore. I un­der­stand that,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I think it is good for Sin­ga­pore that you have hon­est peo­ple in the</p>
    <p>op­po­si­tion, peo­ple who be­lieve in what they are try­ing to do, peo­ple who will stand up and fight for their ideals and, from time to time, dis­agree very strongly with the Gov­ern­ment.”</p>
    <p>But if all vot­ers take the at­ti­tude that they can vote for the op­po­si­tion be­cause an­other per­son will vote for the PAP, Sin­ga­pore will end up with a gov­ern­ment it does not want, PM Lee said.</p>
    <p>“There­fore, some­thing is wrong when you say, I re­ally want one gov­ern­ment but I will vote for an­other one... I think it is necessary that peo­ple un­der­stand this, and un­der­stand what is at stake when you elect a gov­ern­ment of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Elec­tions are not just about the town coun­cil, they are also about elect­ing the gov­ern­ment for the</p>
    <p>coun­try, and that is necessary for peo­ple to bear firmly in mind.”</p>
    <p>Join­ing the fray, Progress Sin­ga­pore Party NCMP Leong Mun Wai said vot­ers can see there is a “com­fort­able mar­gin” be­cause the PAP still has the vast ma­jor­ity of the seats in Par­lia­ment. “Sin­ga­porean vot­ers are re­ally, re­ally very smart. They know how to con­trol the process,” he added.</p>
    <p>There is no ques­tion that Sin­ga­pore wants a PAP gov­ern­ment now, but the elec­torate will not sit by if the Gov­ern­ment’s per­for­mance does not im­prove, he said.</p>
    <p>Mov­ing to the topic of jobs and the coun­try’s so­cial safety net, Mr Leong added that Sin­ga­pore­ans do not want a revo­lu­tion, but a “re­bal­anc­ing”.</p>
    <p>PM Lee gave him a brief re­sponse, say­ing he had al­ready ad­dressed Mr Leong’s first point ex­ten­sively. “He doesn’t add any­thing new to it, in fact, he re­in­forced the prob­lem ex­actly. Mr Pri­tam Singh is not the only one mak­ing this ar­gu­ment, and if ev­ery­one makes this ar­gu­ment, ev­ery­one is go­ing to be in trou­ble.”</p>
    <p>He added that Mr Leong’s other point could be dis­cussed in Par­lia­ment an­other day, but did not per­tain to the fo­cus of his speech.</p>
    <p>“I am talk­ing here about which way Sin­ga­pore pol­i­tics is go­ing, what the risks are go­ing in this di­rec­tion, what we must do in or­der to make it turn out right.”</p>
