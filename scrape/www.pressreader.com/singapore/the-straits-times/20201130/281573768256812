    <p>Sin­ga­pore is boost­ing ef­forts to grow more food lo­cally, with the pan­demic high­light­ing how di­ver­si­fy­ing food sources may not be enough to en­sure sta­ble sup­ply. Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu said plans to bump up lo­cal food pro­duc­tion has con­tin­ued even as Covid-19 dis­rupted global sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is step­ping up ef­forts to grow more food lo­cally, with the on­go­ing pan­demic high­light­ing how di­ver­si­fy­ing food sources may not be enough to en­sure a sta­ble sup­ply.</p>
    <p>Plans to bump up lo­cal food pro­duc­tion con­tin­ued over the past year, even as the Covid-19 pan­demic dis­rupted global sup­ply chains, said Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu in an in­ter­view with The Straits Times last week.</p>
    <p>“In the past, we al­ways talked about the need to di­ver­sify sources. But what if we have short­ages from all sources?” said Ms Fu, 56.</p>
    <p>This worry played out here dur­ing the early days of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Shop­pers rushed to su­per­mar­kets and emp­tied shelves, fear­ing a food short­age due to suc­ces­sive lock­downs around the world.</p>
    <p>“We had a mo­men­tary panic.</p>
    <p>And that sort of al­luded to us the pos­si­bil­ity of a global short­age,” Ms Fu said.</p>
    <p>“Sim­i­larly, with cli­mate change and ex­treme weather, it is con­ceiv­able... that we may have a short­age on the global scale if we don’t do any­thing now to ar­rest that cli­mate change,” she added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore last year set a goal – dubbed 30X30 – to pro­duce 30 per cent of its own food by 2030, up from less than 10 per cent to­day. The Gov­ern­ment wants farm­ers to do this by lever­ag­ing tech­nol­ogy. The pan­demic has not set back this goal, with ef­forts sped up to help lo­cal farms ramp up pro­duc­tion over the next six to 24 months.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, the Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>Food Agency un­der Ms Fu’s min­istry awarded close to $40 mil­lion un­der its 30X30 ex­press grant to ac­cel­er­ate lo­cal food pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>But Ms Fu also stressed that the min­istry has a lot on its plate be­yond food sup­ply, with press­ing is­sues cov­er­ing ev­ery­thing from wa­ter sup­ply to sea-level rise.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s fourth de­sali­na­tion plant in Ma­rina East be­gan com­mer­cial op­er­a­tions in June de­spite the pan­demic, Ms Fu pointed out.</p>
    <p>Her min­istry is look­ing at turn­ing waste into a re­source by turn­ing trash into trea­sure. Ms Fu said re­search is be­ing done on how to use in­cin­er­a­tion bot­tom ash as con­struc­tion ma­te­rial.</p>
    <p>At the same time, Sin­ga­pore is pre­par­ing to pro­tect it­self against sea-level rise and has since 2011 raised the min­i­mum level for newly re­claimed land from 3m to 4m above the mean sea level.</p>
    <p>Fu­ture fa­cil­i­ties such as the Changi Air­port Ter­mi­nal 5 and Tuas Ter­mi­nal mega port will be built even higher – at least 5m above mean sea level. “So in this process we’re go­ing to need a lot of ma­te­ri­als,” said Ms Fu.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s sus­tain­abil­ity drive will also cre­ate jobs for peo­ple, she added.</p>
    <p>“As we go through the tran­si­tion, we build up the ca­pa­bil­ity, there will be com­pe­ten­cies that are ex­portable. I think coun­tries around the world are look­ing for so­lu­tions, we are cre­at­ing some of the so­lu­tions our­selves,” she said.</p>
    <p>“We hope to com­mer­cialise some of them, in­clud­ing ser­vices such as en­ergy man­age­ment sys­tems, and this will all be po­ten­tial for new jobs... and also new tech­nolo­gies.”</p>
    <p>She said that her min­istry also wants to push for the high­est stan­dards in the guide­lines for green pro­cure­ment in the civil ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Given the way things are evolv­ing, she thinks it is fit­ting that her min­istry – pre­vi­ously called the Min­istry of En­vi­ron­ment and Wa­ter Re­sources – was re­named the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and En­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>“All the streams that we are work­ing on, whether it’s food, whether it’s waste, wa­ter or en­ergy, we’re look­ing at loop­ing it, we’re look­ing at how to make more sus­tain­able use of the re­source,” she said.</p>
