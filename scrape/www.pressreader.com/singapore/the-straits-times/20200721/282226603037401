    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Dur­ing a blue-sky mo­ment in 2018 near the end of a decade-long eco­nomic ex­pan­sion, it was the United States that helped pull the world along as the ex­tra cash from tax cuts and gov­ern­ment spend­ing flowed through do­mes­tic and global mar­kets.</p>
    <p>But if it was US pol­icy that pushed the world higher then, it is US pol­icy that threat­ens to pull the world un­der now, as the coun­try’s trou­bled re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic emerges as a chief risk to any sus­tained global re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials from Mex­ico to Ja­pan are al­ready on edge.</p>
    <p>Ex­ports have taken a hit in Ger­many and Ja­pan, and Canada looks south war­ily know­ing that any fur­ther hit to US growth will un­doubt­edly spill over.</p>
    <p>“Glob­ally there will be dif­fi­cult months and years ahead and it is of par­tic­u­lar con­cern that the num­ber of Covid-19 cases is still ris­ing,” the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund</p>
    <p>(IMF) said in a re­view of the US econ­omy that cited “so­cial un­rest” due to ris­ing poverty as one of the risks to eco­nomic growth.</p>
    <p>“The risk ahead is that a large share of the US pop­u­la­tion will have to con­tend with an im­por­tant de­te­ri­o­ra­tion of liv­ing stan­dards and sig­nif­i­cant eco­nomic hard­ship for sev­eral years.</p>
    <p>“This, in turn, can fur­ther weaken de­mand and ex­ac­er­bate longer-term head­winds to growth.”</p>
    <p>It was a clin­i­cal de­scrip­tion of a grim set of facts.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the US gov­ern­ment com­mit­ted roughly US$3 tril­lion (S$4.2 tril­lion) to sup­port the econ­omy through a round of re­stric­tions on ac­tiv­ity im­posed to curb the virus in April and May, the dis­ease is surg­ing in the US to record lev­els, just as those sup­port pro­grammes are due to ex­pire.</p>
    <p>More than 3.8 mil­lion peo­ple have been in­fected and 143,000 killed.</p>
    <p>Daily growth in cases has tripled to more than 70,000 since mid-May, and the seven-day mov­ing av­er­age of deaths, af­ter fall­ing steadily from April to ear­lier this month, has turned higher.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the coun­try has frac­tured over is­sues, in­clud­ing mask-wear­ing that in other parts of the world was adopted read­ily as a mat­ter of com­mon courtesy.</p>
    <p>With some key states in­clud­ing Texas and Cal­i­for­nia now reim­pos­ing re­stric­tions, an­a­lysts have al­ready noted a pos­si­ble plateau to the US re­cov­ery, with the coun­try still 13.3 mil­lion jobs shy of the num­ber in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>A GLOBAL DIS­AP­POINT­MENT</p>
    <p>For other ma­jor eco­nomic pow­ers, that is a weight added to their own strug­gles with the virus and the eco­nomic fall­out.</p>
    <p>The US econ­omy ac­counts for about a quar­ter of world gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP).</p>
    <p>Though much of that is ser­vice-re­lated, and much of the di­rect im­pact of the virus is tied up in in­dus­tries like restau­rants with weak links to the global econ­omy, the con­nec­tions are still there.</p>
    <p>A lost job leads to lower con­sumer spend­ing, which leads to fewer im­ports.</p>
    <p>Weak busi­ness con­di­tions lead to less in­vest­ment in the equip­ment or sup­plies that are of­ten pro­duced else­where.</p>
    <p>Year-to-date US im­ports through May are down more than 13 per cent, or roughly</p>
    <p>US$176 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>In Ger­many, whose mea­sures to con­tain the pan­demic are con­sid­ered to have been among the most ef­fec­tive, ex­ports to the US plunged 36 per cent year on year in May.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts see lit­tle prospect for im­prove­ment, with year-to-date US auto sales through last month down nearly 24 per cent from a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>“That is re­ally a dis­ap­point­ment,” said Pro­fes­sor Gabriel Fel­ber­mayr, pres­i­dent of the Kiel In­sti­tute for the World Econ­omy, in a re­cent in­ter­view with Deutsch­land­funk.</p>
    <p>The spike in US in­fec­tions, he said, could not have been ex­pected.</p>
    <p>In Ja­pan, the speed of the econ­omy’s re­cov­ery is seen tied di­rectly to US suc­cess in stem­ming the virus.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Ja­pan’s Min­istry of Fi­nance re­ported that ex­ports plunged at a dou­ble-digit pace for the fourth month in a row in June, back­ing signs that the pan­demic has knocked the econ­omy into its worst post-war re­ces­sion and rais­ing the spec­tre of a longer and more painful global down­turn.</p>
    <p>US-bound Ja­panese ship­ments nearly halved again due to plum­met­ing de­mand for cars and auto parts, while ex­ports to China re­mained weak, point­ing to the ab­sence of a strong growth en­gine for the world econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Min­istry of Fi­nance data showed Ja­pan’s ex­ports dived 26.2 per cent last month from a year ear­lier, big­ger than a 24.9 per cent de­cline fore­cast by econ­o­mists.</p>
    <p>Dai-ichi Life Re­search In­sti­tute chief econ­o­mist Hideo Ku­mano said: “Ja­pan’s re­cov­ery will be re­ally de­layed if the spread­ing of the coro­n­avirus in the United States isn’t stopped and US-bound ex­ports from var­i­ous Asian coun­tries don’t grow.”</p>
    <p>PES­SIMISM AT BOTH BOR­DERS</p>
    <p>The IMF pro­jected US GDP will shrink this year by 6.6 per cent, in line with many an­a­lysts’ pro­jec­tions.</p>
    <p>The Bank of Canada (BOC) is more pes­simistic, fore­cast­ing US GDP to fall 8.1 per cent on the year. That has al­ready been low­ered once as the pan­demic wors­ened.</p>
    <p>A fur­ther leg down would hit Canada di­rectly, with per­haps three-fourths of the coun­try’s ex­ports headed over the US bor­der.</p>
    <p>BOC gov­er­nor Tiff Mack­lem said: “We did take down our US pro­jec­tion... I would un­der­line that there’s a lot of un­cer­tainty, and the prin­ci­pal source of the un­cer­tainty is the evo­lu­tion of the coro­n­avirus it­self.”</p>
    <p>Mex­ico is also post­ing record daily num­bers of new cases, but Pres­i­dent An­dres Manuel Lopez Obrador has at times de­flected crit­i­cism of his gov­ern­ment’s ef­forts by point­ing to the US num­bers.</p>
    <p>He un­der­took a risky visit with Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump ear­lier this month, couch­ing his jour­ney to Wash­ing­ton as a mat­ter of eco­nomic ne­ces­sity as Mex­ico at­tempts to re­vive an econ­omy that could shrink by 10 per cent or more this year, ac­cord­ing to fore­casts.</p>
    <p>He hopes the new United States-Mex­ico-Canada Agree­ment, which took ef­fect on July 1, will spur busi­ness and in­vest­ment, but pes­simism has been grow­ing.</p>
    <p>“To the point that peo­ple in the US are los­ing jobs or in­comes, it is a down­ward weight... and it will have ram­i­fi­ca­tions on the abil­ity to con­sume glob­ally,” said se­nior econ­o­mist El­iz­a­beth Cro­foot of the Con­fer­ence Board, which doc­u­mented a record drop in global con­sumer con­fi­dence in a re­cent sur­vey.</p>
    <p>“We take one step for­ward and two steps back.”</p>
