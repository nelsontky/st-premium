    <p>Anti-gov­ern­ment pro­test­ers in Thai­land staged a fresh demon­stra­tion yes­ter­day that at­tracted thou­sands of peo­ple af­ter Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha i gnored their dead­line of 10pm on Satur­day for his res­ig­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Two of the main protest groups said they will stage a rally to the Ger­man Em­bassy to­day – in ap­par­ent de­fi­ance of the King, who spends long pe­ri­ods of time in Ger­many – in sup­port of their de­mands.</p>
    <p>The un­prece­dented tar­get­ing of the monar­chy has also trig­gered ral­lies by pro-roy­al­ists, rais­ing fears of clashes between the ri­val groups.</p>
    <p>BANGKOK • #KingKeep­Fight­ing was the hash­tag used by the em­bat­tled Thai Prime Min­is­ter’s op­er­a­tions cen­tre at the week­end on a Twit­ter post with pic­tures of a walk­a­bout by King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn.</p>
    <p>Faced with pro­test­ers’ calls for Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha to quit and the monar­chy’s big­gest chal­lenge in decades, the roy­al­ist es­tab­lish­ment is show­ing signs of at­tempt­ing to mo­bilise a coun­ter­at­tack.</p>
    <p>The palace has been silent through months of anti-gov­ern­ment protests that have in­creas­ingly aimed at the monar­chy. But on Thurs­day, the King made a sign of sup­port for for­mer junta leader Prayut and on Satur­day, lauded a roy­al­ist demon­stra­tor who had de­fied pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>His sup­port­ers took heart. “Politi­cians, lead­ers of en­e­mies of the King – are you ready to flee the King­dom of Thai­land? Your time is al­most up,” Mr Rien­thong Nanna, the leader of an ul­tra-roy­al­ist vig­i­lante group, threat­ened on Face­book at the week­end.</p>
    <p>The protests at first tar­geted Mr Prayut be­fore de­mand­ing the monar­chy’s pow­ers be curbed too. Demon­stra­tions only grew big­ger af­ter a week of tough emer­gency mea­sures to end them.</p>
    <p>With Mr Prayut still the main tar­get for pro­test­ers, the king lit the fire at the cre­ma­tion of his fa­ther last Thurs­day, nine months af­ter he died.</p>
    <p>Then on Satur­day, in a widely pub­li­cised mo­ment, he ex­pressed en­cour­age­ment for a man who had de­fied pro­test­ers, telling him: “Very brave, very good, thank you.”</p>
    <p>Thais read the sig­nals. “The King just left no doubt. He’s in this fight and he’s back­ing his roy­al­ist-na­tion­al­ist sup­port­ers against the pro-democ­racy youth move­ment,” said Dr James Buchanan, a lec­turer at Bangkok’s Mahi­dol Univer­sity Internatio­nal Col­lege.</p>
    <p>Ms Nattabhorn Juengsangu­ansit, a part­ner at Asia Group Ad­vi­sors, a gov­ern­ment af­fairs con­sul­tancy, said the king’s “ac­tions sig­nal a closer-knit and more aligned es­tab­lish­ment”.</p>
    <p>“There is height­ened ten­sion and a risk of clashes. If the sit­u­a­tion wors­ens, the gov­ern­ment could use it as a pre­text for a heav­ier hand,” she said.</p>
    <p>A dan­ger sign flared last week when a few dozen yel­low-shirted roy­al­ists scuf­fled with stu­dents at the Ramkhamhae­ng Univer­sity, claim­ing vic­tory when the stu­dents backed off with one hurt.</p>
    <p>Thais re­mem­ber a decade of street clashes between roy­al­ist yel­low shirts and red shirt fol­low­ers of pop­ulist leader Thaksin Shi­nawa­tra – trou­ble Mr Prayut used to jus­tify seiz­ing power in 2014.</p>
    <p>Some roy­al­ist lead­ers have dis­avowed vi­o­lence. For them, de­fend­ing the monar­chy is not po­lit­i­cal be­cause the monar­chy is above pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>Mr Rien­thong, how­ever, char­ac­terised the scuf­fle at the univer­sity as nor­mal and said sup­port was grow­ing for tougher ac­tion. “If there is more vi­o­la­tion of the monar­chy... loy­al­ists will not stand by and will not hes­i­tate to es­ca­late vi­o­lence,” he told re­porters.</p>
    <p>Anti-gov­ern­ment pro­test­ers, stressing a non-vi­o­lent ap­proach, are con­cerned. “Some of them re­ally hate us,” said protest leader Ju­tatip Sirikhan.</p>
    <p>Po­lice, who in­ter­vened at the univer­sity, say they will treat ev­ery­one fairly and stop vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of roy­al­ist events has been ris­ing, with al­most daily ral­lies now, from barely any a month ago. So far, those in Bangkok have largely drawn at most a few hun­dred peo­ple com­pared to tens of thou­sands at the anti-gov­ern­ment protests.</p>
    <p>Out­side Bangkok, there have been signs of greater mo­bil­i­sa­tion, with thou­sands gath­er­ing in yel­low shirts, although some­times the crowds also in­clude state em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Many Thais are wor­ried what comes next. A poll by the Na­tional In­sti­tute of De­vel­op­ment Ad­min­is­tra­tion found nearly 60 per cent of Thais feared vi­o­lence between the ri­val groups or through the in­ter­ven­tion of other par­ties.</p>
    <p>HEAV­IER HAND? There is height­ened ten­sion and a risk of clashes. If the sit­u­a­tion wors­ens, the gov­ern­ment could use it as a pre­text for a heav­ier hand. MS NATTABHORN JUENGSANGU­ANSIT, part­ner at Asia Group Ad­vi­sors, a gov­ern­ment af­fairs con­sul­tancy.</p>
