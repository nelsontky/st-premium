    <p>To bet­ter en­sure the safety of its bus driv­ers, SBS Tran­sit has in­stalled trans­par­ent pro­tec­tive shields around the driver’s seat on six of its buses.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic trans­port op­er­a­tor said yes­ter­day that this is part of a two-week trial to gauge the ef­fec­tive­ness of pro­tec­tive screens amid the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>The shields are made of poly­car­bon­ate, a hard plas­tic ma­te­rial. They aim to min­imise po­ten­tial con­tact between bus driv­ers and their pas­sen­gers, to fur­ther re­duce the risk of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>They are mod­elled af­ter the ones be­ing tri­alled in 400 Com­fortDelGro taxis, but have been mod­i­fied for use on buses.</p>
    <p>The in­stal­la­tion of taxi shields was com­pleted in the mid­dle of last month, and Com­fortDelGro said the trial will run for at least a few months.</p>
    <p>Eight in 10 pas­sen­gers in th­ese taxis said the shield made them feel safer, in a sur­vey con­ducted by the taxi gi­ant.</p>
    <p>Like the taxi shield, the bus shield cov­ers the driver’s cabin.</p>
    <p>A side open­ing al­lows an un­ob­structed view of the bus’ left side mir­ror and the side flap makes it easy for driv­ers to get out of their seats to as­sist pas­sen­gers in need.</p>
    <p>To min­imise re­flec­tion, a trans­par­ent film has been ap­plied on the shield. The lo­cally man­u­fac­tured screens were de­signed and in­stalled by Moove Me­dia, a wholly owned sub­sidiary of Com­fortDelGro, the par­ent com­pany of SBS Tran­sit.</p>
    <p>SBS Tran­sit act­ing chief ex­ec­u­tive Cheng Siak Kian said: “Our bus cap­tains are on the front line where they serve many com­muters daily.</p>
    <p>“Given the pro­longed and un­cer­tain sit­u­a­tion with Covid-19, we think the pro­tec­tive shield is an idea worth ex­plor­ing to en­hance pro­tec­tion for our bus cap­tains.”</p>
    <p>The six buses that have been fit­ted with the shields are on ser­vices 19, 28, 147, 196, 198 and 249.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that SMRT has sub­mit­ted a pro­posal to the Land Trans­port Author­ity to trial pro­tec­tive shields on its buses and is eval­u­at­ing their use for its taxis.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted, SMRT said it will pro­vide de­tails later.</p>
    <p>Tower Tran­sit and Premier Taxis said they cur­rently have no plans to in­stall pro­tec­tive shields in the ve­hi­cles they man­age.</p>
