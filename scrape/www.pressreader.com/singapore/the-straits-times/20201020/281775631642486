    <p>Ja­pan and Viet­nam agreed to boost their de­fence and eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing through the ex­port of mil­i­tary equip­ment, with Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga in Hanoi on his first for­eign trip since tak­ing of­fice last month.</p>
    <p>His pri­or­ity was to ce­ment the back­ing of the 10-mem­ber Asean, which is chaired by Viet­nam this year, for the Free and Open Indo-Pa­cific vi­sion amid China’s as­sertive­ness.</p>
    <p>While crit­ics have said the ini­tia­tive lacks sub­stance, Ja­pan and its coun­ter­parts have sought to add more teeth to the vi­sion, in­clud­ing through such means as the Quad group, com­pris­ing Ja­pan, the United States, In­dia and Aus­tralia, which China has crit­i­cised as “stok­ing a new Cold War”.</p>
    <p>“It is a big step for the se­cu­rity of our two coun­tries to reach a sub­stan­tive agree­ment on the trans­fer of de­fence tech­nol­ogy and equip­ment,” Mr Suga said after meet­ing his Viet­namese coun­ter­part Nguyen Xuan Phuc.</p>
    <p>The two lead­ers stressed the need to main­tain peace, se­cu­rity, free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion and over­flight in the South China Sea, as well as the prin­ci­ple of peace­ful dis­pute set­tle­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Phuc wel­comed Ja­pan’s “ac­tive role in con­tribut­ing to the re­gional and global peace and sta­bil­ity”, in re­sponse to Mr Suga’s prom­ise that his coun­try will con­tinue to con­trib­ute to re­gional peace and pros­per­ity.</p>
    <p>In Tokyo, De­fence Min­is­ter Nobuo Kishi met his Aus­tralian coun­ter­part Linda Reynolds.</p>
    <p>Mr Kishi said Ja­pan will work to­wards al­low­ing the pro­tec­tion of Aus­tralian mil­i­tary as­sets even in non-com­bat sit­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>He added that the US, Ja­pan and Aus­tralia are plan­ning a joint mil­i­tary drill near the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>In Hanoi, in a speech at the Viet­nam Ja­pan Univer­sity, Mr Suga de­nounced ac­tions that have con­trib­uted to a re­cent rise in ten­sions as “against the rule of law”.</p>
    <p>With­out di­rectly pin­point­ing China, he said in veiled al­lu­sion: “It is im­por­tant that all the na­tions in­volved work to­wards a peace­ful res­o­lu­tion of con­flicts in the South China Sea – with­out re­sort­ing to force or co­er­cion.”</p>
    <p>Mr Suga and Mr Phuc agreed in prin­ci­ple to a deal that al­lows Ja­pan to sup­ply de­fence equip­ment and tech­nol­ogy – in­clud­ing pa­trol planes and radar – to Viet­nam to help it im­prove its sur­veil­lance ca­pa­bil­i­ties. Viet­nam is among the ter­ri­to­ries dis­put­ing China’s blan­ket claim of the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan, which ended a ban on over­seas arms sales in 2014, is also in talks with In­done­sia and Thai­land on sim­i­lar de­fence trans­fer deals, hav­ing signed such pacts with Malaysia and the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan also wants its com­pa­nies to di­ver­sify their sup­ply chain from China. Viet­nam is a choice des­ti­na­tion to set up fac­to­ries for half of the 30 com­pa­nies to be granted sub­si­dies in a 23.5 bil­lion yen (S$302.5 mil­lion) scheme to en­cour­age firms to di­ver­sify their plants.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga said: “The new coro­n­avirus has made it even clearer that to main­tain in­ter­na­tional sup­ply chains, it is im­por­tant to lower the risk of dis­rup­tion and to cre­ate sus­tain­able sup­ply sys­tems.”</p>
    <p>Mr Phuc said he was ready to sup­port Ja­panese in­vest­ment in Viet­nam in such ar­eas as real es­tate and hu­man re­sources. Mr Suga, in turn, promised to sup­port Viet­namese for­eign work­ers who have been af­fected by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>They also wit­nessed the sign­ing of agree­ments for Ja­pan’s Marubeni Corp to in­vest US$1.3 bil­lion (S$1.76 bil­lion) in a power plant, and an­other for Tokyo Gas and PetroViet­nam Power Corp to jointly build a US$1.9 bil­lion gas-fired plant.</p>
    <p>They also agreed on a “busi­ness track” ar­range­ment that ex­empts busi­ness vis­i­tors from quar­an­tine reg­u­la­tions, and to re­sume flights between the two na­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga leaves for In­done­sia to­day.</p>
