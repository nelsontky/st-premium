    <p>In­comes in Sin­ga­pore have con­tin­ued to rise in the past five years, while ne­ces­si­ties such as ed­u­ca­tion re­main af­ford­able.</p>
    <p>The coun­try also con­tin­ues to be busi­ness-friendly and in­ter­na­tion­ally com­pet­i­tive.</p>
    <p>These are among the key achieve­ments of the pub­lic ser­vice up un­til last year in most cases, ac­cord­ing to a new re­port re­leased by the Min­istry of Fi­nance (MOF) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Pub­lic Sec­tor Out­comes Re­view, a stock­tak­ing of the sec­tor’s work that is un­veiled ev­ery two years, rounds up key fig­ures in such ar­eas as the econ­omy and so­cial sup­port. Here are four key take­aways from the re­port:</p>
    <p>LOWER IN­COME IN­EQUAL­ITY, MORE WORK OP­POR­TU­NI­TIES</p>
    <p>For the first time in five years, last year shows Sin­ga­pore’s Gini co­ef­fi­cient – a mea­sure of in­come in­equal­ity – dip­ping be­low 0.4. A Gini co­ef­fi­cient above 0.4 usu­ally sig­nals a large in­come gap.</p>
    <p>Af­ter tak­ing into ac­count taxes and trans­fers, it fell from 0.452 to 0.398 last year.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly pos­i­tive is the rise in em­ploy­ment in­comes across the board, with those in the bot­tom 20th per­centile ris­ing faster than at the me­dian, which is the mid­point in a range.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat, ref­er­enc­ing the re­port, noted in a Face­book post that “Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents who are em­ployed full time have seen in­comes rise 3.8 per cent per year over the past five years”.</p>
    <p>An­other in­di­ca­tor of progress is the in­creased num­ber of res­i­dents em­ployed, in­clud­ing women and seniors, in the last five years.</p>
    <p>More than half of them are pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs), with the PMET share among em­ployed res­i­dents grow­ing from 54.3 per cent in 2015 to 58.3 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans also have more op­por­tu­ni­ties to pick up new skills.</p>
    <p>By the end of last year, 500,000 in­di­vid­u­als and 14,000 en­ter­prises had ben­e­fited from Skill­sFu­ture ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>The stork, how­ever, con­tin­ues to elude even more Sin­ga­pore­ans, caus­ing the coun­try’s res­i­dent to­tal fer­til­ity rate to de­cline from 1.24 in 2015 to 1.14 last year.</p>
    <p>But ef­forts have been made to en­cour­age fam­i­lies to have chil­dren. For ex­am­ple, the num­ber of preschool places has swelled by more than 30 per cent since 2016. They have be­come more af­ford­able as well, with higher sub­si­dies.</p>
    <p>COM­PET­I­TIVE ECON­OMY AND WORK­FORCE</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore took the top spot among the world’s most com­pet­i­tive economies, ac­cord­ing to the World Economic Fo­rum last year and the In­ter­na­tional In­sti­tute for Man­age­ment De­vel­op­ment this year.</p>
    <p>Even amid the pan­demic, the Economic De­vel­op­ment Board se­cured $13 bil­lion of fixed as­set in­vest­ment com­mit­ments in the first four months of this year.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses in Sin­ga­pore also geared up for longer-term op­por­tu­ni­ties by ven­tur­ing into the re­gion and go­ing dig­i­tal.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, di­rect in­vest­ment by Sin­ga­pore-based com­pa­nies in South-east Asia in­creased by 37 per cent in the last five years.</p>
    <p>More are also go­ing dig­i­tal: 216,000 busi­nesses have reg­is­tered for PayNow Cor­po­rate, en­abling them to send and re­ceive epay­ments in­stantly.</p>
    <p>Shoring up Sin­ga­pore’s com­pet­i­tive edge is the coun­try’s highly re­garded work­force – the only one in Asia to en­ter a list of the top 10 most com­pet­i­tive places for ta­lent in the world.</p>
    <p>PRO-BUSI­NESS EN­VI­RON­MENT AND AC­CESS TO DIG­I­TAL SER­VICES</p>
    <p>This year, Sin­ga­pore ranked sec­ond in the World Bank’s Ease of Do­ing Busi­ness In­dex, and did well in two other in­di­ca­tors – fourth in the world for start­ing a busi­ness and first in the world for en­forc­ing con­tracts.</p>
    <p>It takes just 11 / days to start a</p>
    <p>2 busi­ness in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses have also been able to in­no­vate us­ing faster ap­provals from the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Last year, 77 per cent of busi­nesses were “very or ex­tremely sat­is­fied” with the qual­ity of govern­ment e-ser­vices – a jump of 8 per­cent­age points from 2018.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans’ ac­cess to dig­i­tal govern­ment ser­vices has also im­proved, with the LifeSG app al­low­ing them to ac­cess more than 40 ser­vices.</p>
    <p>SLOW­ING GROWTH AND EM­PLOY­MENT DUE TO COVID-19</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has put a dent in the econ­omy. The real gross do­mes­tic prod­uct growth rate is ex­pected to con­tract by be­tween 6.5 per cent and 6 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>But there re­main pock­ets of re­silience such as bio­med­i­cal man­u­fac­tur­ing, and in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions, said the re­port.</p>
    <p>The labour mar­ket con­tin­ues to face down­ward pres­sure, with the res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment rate reach­ing 4.7 per cent in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>The SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age was in­tro­duced this year to ex­pand job, trainee­ship and skills train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties. More than 117,500 were avail­able as at Au­gust.</p>
