    <p>NEW YORK It is rare that a Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) pre-sea­son game be­comes must-see tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>But Sun­day’s match-up fea­tur­ing the Brook­lyn Nets and Wash­ing­ton Wizards might have been the most an­tic­i­pated pre-sea­son game in New York bas­ket­ball.</p>
    <p>Steve Nash roamed the side­lines for the first time as head coach. But for Nets fans, Kyrie Irv­ing and Kevin Du­rant, one of the most tal­ented duos in the league with a com­bined 16 All-Star se­lec­tions, played for the first time as team­mates.</p>
    <p>A torn Achilles ten­don meant Du­rant missed all of last sea­son, while Irv­ing’s own in­jury prob­lems lim­ited him to 20 games.</p>
    <p>The Nets won 119-114 at the Bar­clays Cen­tre but what mat­tered was the prod­uct on the floor.</p>
    <p>Du­rant and Irv­ing looked ev­ery bit the stars they have been their en­tire ca­reers. Pre-sea­son or not, the pair mostly looked like the same play­ers, giv­ing the Nets brass enough to be op­ti­mistic about their cham­pi­onship as­pi­ra­tions for the 2020-21 sea­son.</p>
    <p>One of the best scor­ers in the his­tory of the NBA, Du­rant pulled off moves he had re­fined be­fore his in­jury, like his one-footed fade­away, and was also ac­tive on de­fence.</p>
    <p>Af­ter scor­ing 15 points in 24 firsthalf min­utes, the for­ward felt that the game was a “good first step”.</p>
    <p>“It felt great to get back in the rou­tine and get back on the floor and feel like a player again,” Du­rant said of his first game since June 10 last year.</p>
    <p>“I was anx­ious, ner­vous. I vi­su­alised this mo­ment for so long – nine, 10 months of think­ing about how I’ll be in the next stage of my ca­reer. I was champ­ing at the bit. Espe­cially when Covid hit, I was just so frus­trated. I didn’t see when the sea­son would start in the fu­ture. To go through this felt solid and I have to keep build­ing on it.”</p>
    <p>Nash, a Hall of Famer start­ing his rookie year as a coach, added: “The beauty of Kevin, ob­vi­ously on top of all the abil­ity he brings to the game, is his love for the game.</p>
    <p>“He brings a child-like joy and a love for the game ev­ery day when he comes to work. So it’s beau­ti­ful to see him back on the bas­ket­ball court. I think the world missed him out there.”</p>
    <p>Irv­ing was not any dif­fer­ent, fin­ish­ing with 18 points and dish­ing out four as­sists.</p>
    <p>“That’s one of the perks of this po­si­tion, you get to coach two in­cred­i­ble play­ers,” Nash said. “Ky was su­per sharp and Kevin, af­ter such an ex­ten­sive lay-off, was very good and close to be­ing in­cred­i­ble.”</p>
