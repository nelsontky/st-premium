    <p>FIC­TION</p>
    <p>By Tsitsi Dan­garem­bga</p>
    <p>Faber and Faber/Pa­per­back/</p>
    <p>384 pages/$19.26/</p>
    <p>Avail­able at bit.ly/Mourn­ableBody_TD</p>
    <p>More than 30 years have passed since Ner­vous Con­di­tions, Tsitsi Dan­garem­bga’s Bil­dungsro­man about a vil­lage girl in Zim­babwe, swept into the lit­er­ary world with the tren­chant open­ing line: “I was not sorry when my brother died.”</p>
    <p>This Mourn­able Body, the last instalment in a tril­ogy, puts us yet again in the shoes of Tam­budzai – Tambu for short – who is now in her 40s and liv­ing in a run-down youth hos­tel in the city of Harare at the turn of the mil­len­nium.</p>
    <p>The qual­i­fi­ca­tions she earned at con­vent school and univer­sity – made pos­si­ble af­ter her brother died – were sup­posed to be tick­ets to a bet­ter life, but things have not panned out the way she had hoped.</p>
    <p>The adult Tambu, a lot more psy­cho­log­i­cally con­torted than her teenage self, is a bun­dle of bit­ter­ness and self-loathing.</p>
    <p>Af­ter quit­ting her stag­nant job at an ad agency, she finds a job as a school teacher, then leaves when she is driven to break­ing point.</p>
    <p>She later finds work at an eco­tourism firm run by a white ex-class­mate, Tracey.</p>
    <p>This novel, quite aptly, is nar­rated i n sec­ond per­son. The ac­cusatory “you” evokes a sense of fa­tal­ism, as well as a dead­en­ing of agency. One feels that Tambu is con­strained by out­side forces – prob­lems of racial and gen­der dis­crim­i­na­tion in in­de­pen­dent Zim­babwe, say – yet partly to blame for her is­sues.</p>
    <p>This Mourn­able Body is an ac­com­plished piece of work by a novelist at the height of her ca­reer.</p>
    <p>Dan­garem­bga’s prose, as usual, is flaw­less. She de­serves to be read more widely – nei­ther Ner­vous Con­di­tions (hailed as a mod­ern clas­sic) nor its 2006 se­quel, The Book Of Not, can be found i n Na­tional Li­brary Board branches.</p>
    <p>What makes this par­tic­u­lar book stand out is its psy­cho­log­i­cal com­plex­ity. If any­thing, This Mourn­able Body demon­strates that there is noth­ing en­nobling about suf­fer­ing. Tambu’s hard­ship, in fact, makes her cyn­i­cal and cruel, as she turns against the very women with whom she could be band­ing in sol­i­dar­ity.</p>
    <p>In one dis­con­cert­ing scene near the start of the novel, Tambu’s at­trac­tive hostel­mate Gertrude strug­gles to get onto the combi (minibus) and is taunted by lewd men. Tambu joins in, be­com­ing one with the mob.</p>
    <p>“The crowd rip­ples and fid­gets, hums and buzzes with amuse­ment. En­ergy swirls out from this mirth. It slides you from your seat to the ground and into the throng. The crowd guf­faws. You do too. As you do, you grow and grow un­til you be­lieve you are much big­ger than your­self and this is won­der­ful.”</p>
    <p>When Ner­vous Con­di­tions was pub­lished in 1988, read­ers around the world found the novel ac­ces­si­ble, even if it was set in a so­ci­ety vastly dif­fer­ent from their own.</p>
    <p>Yet, as cul­tural the­o­rist Kwame An­thony Ap­piah points out, it sidesteps that “sa­fari mo­ment” found in other books where Zim­babwe is “con­structed for the moral and lit­er­ary tourist”.</p>
    <p>Things take a meta-fic­tional, self­scru­ti­n­is­ing turn in This Mourn­able Body, when Tambu leads a group of Euro­peans on a tour through her vil­lage. Who is Dan­garem­bga writ­ing the novel for, we won­der?</p>
    <p>There is much to ad­mire about This Mourn­able Body, although it is the kind of book that might ul­ti­mately leave you feel­ing empty in­side. Here, Harare (once known as “Sun­shine City”) is a wasteland with no de­liv­er­ance and a back­drop to a tragedy with no cathar­sis.</p>
    <p>If you like this, read: Ner­vous Con­di­tions (Aye­bia Clarke Pub­lish­ing, 1988, reis­sued 2004, $21.60, avail­able at bit.ly/Ner­vousCond_TD), Dan­garem­bga’s ac­claimed de­but novel about Tam­budzai, a girl liv­ing in Rhode­sia.</p>
