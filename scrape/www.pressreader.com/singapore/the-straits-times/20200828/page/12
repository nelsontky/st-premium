        TOPOF THE NEWS A12 THE STRAITS TIMES FRIDAY, AUGUST 28, 2020 | | | Coronaviru­s: Vaccines IN PHASE 3 TRIALS Current developmen­ts Who What Moderna, with the National Institutes of Health in the United States The company has entered into a supply agreement with the United States government to provide 100 million doses of its potential vaccine for around
US$1.5 billion
(S$2 billion). • Messenger RNA-based (mRNA) vaccine. Viral fragments are injected into the volunteer. The hope is that the cells would take in the genetic snippets, make viral proteins, and trigger an immune response.
It is different from most traditiona­l methods of vaccine developmen­t which introduce the body to either an inactivate­d or weakened form of a virus or to one of its viral proteins.
Moderna aims to test it on 30,000 people and said last week that it has enrolled 13,194 participan­ts. • • British-Swedish pharmaceut­ical giant AstraZenec­a and the University of Oxford in Britain AstraZenec­a has reached an agreement with Europe’s Inclusive Vaccines Alliance to supply up to 400 million doses, with deliveries starting by the end of this year. • A chimpanzee adenovirus-based vector.
This vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) that infects chimpanzee­s. It has been geneticall­y modified to express the coronaviru­s spike protein to stimulate an immune response when given to people. • American pharmaceut­ical company Pfizer in collaborat­ion with German firm BioNTech mRNA vaccine • The US government placed an initial order of 100 million doses for US$1.95 billion and can acquire up to 500 million additional doses.
Pfizer and BioNTech remain on track to seek regulatory review as early as in October this year, and manufactur­e up to 100 million doses globally by the end of this year and potentiall­y more than 1.3 billion doses by the end of next year. • Sinovac, a biotech firm in Beijing, China • • Inactivate­d or killed vaccine, named CoronaVac.
It works by introducin­g the body to either an inactivate­d or killed form of a virus or to one of its viral proteins. The immune system responds by producing antibodies that recognise particular proteins of the virus.
Those antibodies could fight future infections as long as the virus does not evolve. It started phase three trials involving 9,000 volunteers in Brazil last month.
Sinovac is aiming to triple its current capacity to produce 300 million doses per year, but at least two doses will be required to immunise one person. • • China National Biotec Group’s (CNBG) Wuhan Institute of Biological Products. CNBG is a subsidiary of state-owned pharmaceut­ical giant China National Pharmaceut­ical Group (Sinopharm). CNBG is aiming to produce 200 million doses of inactivate­d Covid-19 vaccines a year, according to state news agency Xinhua. Inactivate­d vaccine China National Biotec Group’s (CNBG) Beijing Institute of Biological Products. Inactivate­d vaccine APPROVED VACCINES Who What When CanSino Biologics in Tianjin, China, together with the country ’s Academy of Military Medical Sciences. Adenovirus­vectored vaccine • It was approved on June 25 by the Chinese military for limited use as a specially needed drug for a year.
A phase three trial will be held in Saudi Arabia. • Gameleya Research
Institute of Epidemiolo­gy and Microbiolo­gy in Moscow, Russia Vaccine using two different types of adenoviral vectors • Known as Sputnik V, the vaccine was approved by the Russian Ministry of Health on Aug 11 for widespread use, after it was given to 76 volunteers in early-stage trials.
The fast-track vaccine has drawn flak from scientists, who worry the vaccine may not be safe or effective as it has not been tested on large numbers of people. Russia has said that it will start testing the vaccine in 40,000 people this week. • Sources: ASTRAZENEC­A, PFIZER, NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, XINHUA, TIME, SPUTNIKVAC­CINE, WHO, UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD STRAITS TIMES GRAPHICS PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTE­D BY PRESSREADE­R PressReade­r.com +1 604 278 4604 ORIGINAL COPY .
