    <p>A highly con­ta­gious, acute and fa­tal disease that pri­mar­ily af­fects rab­bits was first de­tected in Sin­ga­pore on Wed­nes­day, the An­i­mal and Ve­teri­nary Ser­vice said. Known as the Rab­bit Hae­m­or­rhagic Disease, it is not trans­mis­si­ble from an­i­mals to peo­ple and does not af­fect other an­i­mal species.</p>
    <p>A highly con­ta­gious, acute and fa­tal disease that pri­mar­ily af­fects rab­bits was de­tected in Sin­ga­pore on Wed­nes­day, said the An­i­mal and Ve­teri­nary Ser­vice (AVS).</p>
    <p>Known as rab­bit hae­m­or­rhagic disease (RHD), it is not trans­mis­si­ble from an­i­mals to peo­ple and does not af­fect other an­i­mal species, the AVS said on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“The virus that causes RHD was de­tected in sam­ples from pet rab­bits sub­mit­ted by a ve­teri­nary clinic.</p>
    <p>“None of the cases is known to have a travel his­tory,” said the ser­vice, which is a clus­ter within the Na­tional Parks Board.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed that there may be up to 11 af­fected rab­bits. Eight have died.</p>
    <p>The AVS said it is in­ves­ti­gat­ing pos­si­ble sources and the spread of the disease here. It will also work with ve­teri­nary clin­ics and dis­trib­u­tors on get­ting vac­cines.</p>
    <p>While there is no spe­cific treat­ment avail­able, sup­port­ive care can be pro­vided for in­fected rab­bits.</p>
    <p>RHD is en­demic in Europe, Aus­tralia, New Zealand, Cuba, as well as parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
    <p>It is trans­mit­ted be­tween rab­bits through di­rect con­tact with in­fected flu­ids, fur and car­casses. Trans­mis­sion through in­sects and ob­jects such as shoes, cloth­ing and equip­ment has been recorded.</p>
    <p>The in­cu­ba­tion pe­riod of RHD is be­tween one and five days, and death may oc­cur within 12 to 36 hours once clin­i­cal signs de­velop.</p>
    <p>Symp­toms may in­clude anorexia, dull­ness, pros­tra­tion, ner­vous signs, groans and cries, or res­pi­ra­tory signs such as breath­ing dif­fi­cul­ties or dis­charge from the nose.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal rab­bit own­ers such as stu­dent Dan­son Khor, 23, worry that the disease is known to be fa­tal.</p>
    <p>Mr Khor owns two rab­bits – an eight-year-old hol­land lop and a seven-year-old english an­gora.</p>
    <p>“I will take ev­ery pre­cau­tion pos­si­ble to keep my bun­nies safe, like keeping them in an air-con­di­tioned room with in­sect screens,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Sarah Wong, a vet­eri­nar­ian at Mount Pleas­ant (East) un­der the Mount Pleas­ant Ve­teri­nary Group (MPVG), rec­om­mends that own­ers keep their pets in­doors and min­imise con­tact with other rab­bits.</p>
    <p>“The risk of RHD is low for rab­bits housed in­doors with min­i­mal ex­po­sure to rab­bits from other house­holds,” she said. “How­ever, RHD is highly con­ta­gious among rab­bits via body flu­ids and con­tam­i­nated ob­jects.”</p>
    <p>This means that rab­bit own­ers may in­ad­ver­tently trans­mit the disease to their pets if they touch an in­fected rab­bit and, be­fore dis­in­fect­ing their hands and clothes prop­erly, han­dle their own rab­bit.</p>
    <p>Con­sul­ta­tions at MPVG’s clin­ics are on an ap­point­ment-only ba­sis.</p>
    <p>Ms Jace­lyn Heng, vice-pres­i­dent of the House Rab­bit So­ci­ety Sin­ga­pore, said the de­tec­tion of the disease in Sin­ga­pore is a mat­ter of con­cern and pet rab­bits may have to be vac­ci­nated in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>She urged all rab­bit own­ers not to aban­don their pets. “Please let your bun­nies stay home to stay safe.”</p>

The An&#xAD;i&#xAD;mal and Ve&#xAD;teri&#xAD;nary Ser&#xAD;vice said it is in&#xAD;ves&#xAD;ti&#xAD;gat&#xAD;ing pos&#xAD;si&#xAD;ble sources of the rab&#xAD;bit hae&#xAD;m&#xAD;or&#xAD;rhagic disease here.&#xD;&#xA;The disease is not trans&#xAD;mis&#xAD;si&#xAD;ble from an&#xAD;i&#xAD;mals to peo&#xAD;ple and does not af&#xAD;fect other an&#xAD;i&#xAD;mal species.</p>
