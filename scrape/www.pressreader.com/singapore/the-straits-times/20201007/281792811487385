    <p>Twenty-one din­ers have been fined $300 each for flout­ing Covid-19 rules at food and bev­er­age out­lets, such as not wear­ing a mask promptly af­ter eat­ing or drink­ing, in­ter­min­gling be­tween ta­bles and sit­ting in groups of more than five.</p>
    <p>These breaches were ob­served in eater­ies at Re­sorts World Sen­tosa,</p>
    <p>Boat Quay and Clarke Quay, the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment (MSE) said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, two F&B out­lets have been or­dered to close for 10 days, while 13 out­lets were fined for breach­ing Covid-19 mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The two out­lets told to close are Tong Xin Ru Yi Tra­di­tional Hot­pot and In­vin­ci­ble Noo­dle House. Both eater­ies are at Boat Quay.</p>
    <p>At the hot­pot restau­rant, nine cus­tomers were seen min­gling across two ta­bles in a pri­vate room last Satur­day around 9.15pm, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>On the same day at In­vin­ci­ble Noo­dle House, sev­eral cus­tomers were found con­sum­ing al­co­hol at 11.40pm.</p>
    <p>The sale and con­sump­tion of liquor is not al­lowed at F&B out­lets af­ter 10.30pm un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act.</p>
    <p>The Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Author­ity is­sued an or­der to both eater­ies, re­quir­ing the op­er­a­tors to close the premises for a pe­riod of 10 days, from Oct 3 to 12.</p>
    <p>The 13 F&B out­lets fined were taken to task for seat­ing groups of more than five from dif­fer­ent house­holds to­gether, al­low­ing groups to min­gle be­tween ta­bles, seat­ing groups less than 1m apart, and not en­sur­ing that food han­dlers wear masks prop­erly.</p>
    <p>One out­let was fined $2,000 for re­peat of­fences while the other 12 were fined $1,000.</p>
    <p>MSE re­it­er­ated that masks should be worn at all times ex­cept when eat­ing or drink­ing, or do­ing stren­u­ous ac­tiv­i­ties, re­gard­less of premises.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a re­cent in­for­mal poll on­line of 130 peo­ple by The Sun­day Times found that while most peo­ple were aware of the mask­ing pol­icy, they ap­peared to take var­ied ap­proaches when din­ing out.</p>
    <p>Forty-three per cent of those sur­veyed in­di­cated that they re­moved their masks just be­fore they started eat­ing or drink­ing, 26 per cent said they would do so only af­ter a drink ar­rived, while 17 per cent said they would stay masked un­til food was served.</p>
    <p>Only 12 per cent said they would re­move their masks as soon as they sat down at a ta­ble.</p>
    <p>Post-meal be­hav­iour was equally var­ied. Forty-three per cent of re­spon­dents said they donned their masks im­me­di­ately af­ter fin­ish­ing their food, even if their din­ing part­ners were still eat­ing, while 34 per cent put on their masks only if they were prepar­ing to leave the ta­ble, such as to go to the bath­room.</p>
    <p>But 16 per cent said they masked up only af­ter ev­ery­one at the ta­ble had fin­ished eat­ing and drink­ing, and 5 per cent said they put on their masks once the ta­ble was cleared.</p>
    <p>On Sept 29, the min­istry an­nounced that en­force­ment ac­tion was taken against 32 din­ers and 22 F&B out­lets, of which eight were or­dered to close.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment said it will con­tinue with en­force­ment checks at F&B out­lets to en­sure that they re­main safe spa­ces for all.</p>
    <p>“Agen­cies will not hes­i­tate to take en­force­ment ac­tions against both pa­trons and premises that do not com­ply with safe man­age­ment mea­sures.”</p>
