    <p>•</p>
    <p>KUALA LUMPUR Ai­rA­sia Group is seek­ing to raise as much as RM2.5 bil­lion (S$822 mil­lion) by the end of the year as it tries to sur­vive a busi­ness slump ex­ac­er­bated by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Malaysian bud­get car­rier may bor­row up to RM1.5 bil­lion from banks and an­other RM1 bil­lion from in­vestors, a spokesman said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ai­rA­sia is also in talks with lo­cal and for­eign in­vestors, in­clud­ing pri­vate eq­uity firms, strate­gic part­ners and con­glom­er­ates, she said, con­firm­ing an ear­lier re­port by Reuters that cited group chief ex­ec­u­tive Tony Fer­nan­des.</p>
    <p>Air­lines around the world are los­ing money af­ter ground­ing thou­sands of planes as coun­tries shut bor­ders and re­strict the move­ment of peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Ai­rA­sia, which last month posted its largest quar­terly loss on record, re­sumed do­mes­tic op­er­a­tions in late April, but its long-haul unit, Ai­rA­sia X, is still not fly­ing.</p>
    <p>Au­di­tor Ernst & Young said in July their abil­ity to con­tinue as go­ing con­cerns may be in “sig­nif­i­cant doubt”.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s SK Group said in June that it was in talks to buy a small stake in Ai­rA­sia, with­out pro­vid­ing fur­ther de­tails.</p>
    <p>The air­line has also cut the salaries of man­age­ment, trimmed jobs and de­ferred plane de­liv­er­ies in an at­tempt to shave costs by 30 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>Ai­rA­sia is also eval­u­at­ing its op­er­a­tions in Ja­pan and will make a de­ci­sion very soon, the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>Its In­dia ven­ture re­mains as is, she added with­out elab­o­rat­ing.</p>
    <p>The air­line is look­ing to con­soli</p>
    <p>date and strengthen its busi­ness in South-east Asia, even if that means ex­it­ing Ja­pan and In­dia, Reuters re­ported ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Ai­rA­sia X said last month that it needs to reach agree­ments with ma­jor cred­i­tors to re­struc­ture out­stand­ing debt be­cause it faces “se­vere liq­uid­ity con­straints” that threaten its abil­ity to re­sume fly­ing and con­tinue as a go­ing con­cern.</p>
    <p>The long-haul bud­get unit and its sub­sidiary AAX Leas­ing Two have re­ceived a claim from les­sor BOC Avi­a­tion re­gard­ing US$23 mil­lion (S$31.5 mil­lion) of out­stand­ing amounts due un­der lease agree­ments, ac­cord­ing to an ex­change fil­ing last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Ai­rA­sia X, which said it is seek­ing le­gal ad­vice, leases four air­craft from BOC.</p>
    <p>Ai­rA­sia is one of Air­bus’ ma­jor cus­tomers for A-320s while Ai­rA­sia X is the world’s big­gest cus­tomer of Air­bus A-330neo planes.</p>
    <p>Ai­rA­sia X has 78 of the air­craft on or­der, ac­cord­ing to Air­bus’ web­site, and has al­ready de­ferred de­liv­ery of some A-330neos.</p>
    <p>Ai­rA­sia’s In­dia ven­ture re­mains as is, a spokesman said with­out elab­o­rat­ing. The air­line is look­ing to con­sol­i­date and strengthen its busi­ness in South-east Asia, even if that means ex­it­ing Ja­pan and In­dia, Reuters re­ported ear­lier.</p>
