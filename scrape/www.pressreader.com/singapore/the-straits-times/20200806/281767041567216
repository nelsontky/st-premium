    <p>BEIRUT • Res­cuers searched for sur­vivors yes­ter­day af­ter cat­a­clysmic ex­plo­sions at Beirut’s port sowed dev­as­ta­tion across en­tire city neigh­bour­hoods, killing more than 100 peo­ple, wound­ing thou­sands and plung­ing Le­banon deeper into cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Beirut gov­er­nor Marwan Abboud spoke of “an apoc­a­lyp­tic si­t­u­a­tion” which he said may have made 300,000 peo­ple tem­po­rar­ily home­less and would cost the coun­try over US$3 bil­lion (S$4.1 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>Le­banon’s Cab­i­net has de­clared a two-week state of emer­gency and handed con­trol of se­cu­rity in the cap­i­tal to the mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>The blasts left the Le­banese cap­i­tal re­sem­bling the scene of an earth­quake, with thou­sands of peo­ple left desti­tute and thou­sands more cram­ming into over­whelmed hos­pi­tals for treat­ment. “A mas­sacre. I saw peo­ple scream­ing, cov­ered in blood, homes bro­ken, glass shat­tered, roads that l ook like Hiroshima or like a tsunami hit,” said Mr Elie Zakaria, a res­i­dent of a neigh­bour­hood close to the port.</p>
    <p>In an in­stant, the blasts left de­struc­tion equiv­a­lent to that caused by the coun­try’s 1975-1990 civil war, lev­el­ling build­ings sev­eral hun­dred me­tres away.</p>
    <p>A res­i­dent of nearby Mar Mikhael, pop­u­lar for its bars and cafes, said she saw bod­ies strewn in the street, ap­par­ently thrown off bal­conies and rooftops by the blasts.</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple had been watch­ing and film­ing a fire caused by an ear­lier ex­plo­sion when the sec­ond, mas­sive blast went off.</p>
    <p>The re­sult­ing footage, widely shared on so­cial me­dia, shows a ball of fire and smoke ris­ing above Beirut and a white shock wave en­gulf­ing ev­ery­thing around it.</p>
    <p>The mush­room-shaped sec­ond ex­plo­sion – which seis­mol­o­gists said was logged as the equiv­a­lent of a 3.3-mag­ni­tude earth­quake – and the scope of the dam­age drew nu­clear analo­gies in many peo­ple’s ac­counts of the tragedy.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials said the toll was ex­pected to rise. Pres­i­dent Michel Aoun said 2,750 tonnes of am­mo­nium ni­trate, used in fer­tilis­ers and bombs, had been stored for six years at the port with­out safety mea­sures. He called it “un­ac­cept­able”.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tors will try to de­ter­mine whether the blasts were ac­ci­dents or in­ten­tion­ally trig­gered.</p>
    <p>Le­banon’s Cab­i­net yes­ter­day agreed to place all Beirut port of­fi­cials who have over­seen stor­age and se­cu­rity since 2014 un­der house ar­rest, min­is­te­rial sources said.</p>
    <p>Or­di­nary Le­banese di­rected anger at politi­cians who have over­seen decades of state cor­rup­tion and bad gov­er­nance that plunged the na­tion into fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“It’s like a war zone. I’m speech­less,” Beirut’s mayor, Ja­mal Itani, told Reuters while in­spect­ing dam­age he es­ti­mated ran into bil­lions of dol­lars. “This is a catas­tro­phe for Beirut and Le­banon.”</p>
    <p>The head of Le­banon’s Red Cross, Mr George Ket­tani, said at least 100 peo­ple had been killed. “We are still sweep­ing the area. There could still be vic­tims. I hope not,” he said.</p>
    <p>One man was res­cued yes­ter­day af­ter be­ing trapped un­der rub­ble for 16 hours.</p>
    <p>The in­ten­sity of the blasts threw vic­tims into the sea and res­cue teams are still try­ing to re­cover bod­ies. Many of those killed were port and Cus­toms em­ploy­ees and peo­ple work­ing in the area or driv­ing through dur­ing rush hour.</p>
    <p>The Dutch For­eign Min­istry said yes­ter­day that the wife of the Dutch am­bas­sador to Le­banon was se­ri­ously in­jured. A spokesman said she had been ad­mit­ted to hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>He said the blasts had caused ex­ten­sive dam­age to the Dutch Em­bassy, also wound­ing four other peo­ple con­nected to it.</p>
    <p>Fa­cades of cen­tral Beirut build­ings were ripped off, fur­ni­ture was sucked into streets and roads were strewn with glass and de­bris. Cars near the port were flipped over.</p>
    <p>In the down­town area, Mr Bi­lal, a man in his 60s, said: “This is the killer blow for Beirut, we are a dis­as­ter zone. My build­ing shud­dered, I thought it was an earth­quake.”</p>
    <p>Like oth­ers, he blamed politi­cians. “We al­ready have a fi­nan­cial</p>
    <p>A CATAS­TRO­PHE</p>
    <p>It’s like a war zone. I’m speech­less. This is a catas­tro­phe for Beirut and Le­banon. ’’</p>
    <p>BEIRUT’S MAYOR JA­MAL ITANI</p>
    <p>eco­nomic cri­sis, peo­ple are hun­gry and these thieves and loot­ers – will they com­pen­sate for the losses?</p>
    <p>“Who will com­pen­sate for those who lost their loved ones,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Has­san Zaiter, 32, a man­ager at the heav­ily dam­aged Le Gray Ho­tel in down­town Beirut, said: “This mas­sive ex­plo­sion seals the col­lapse of Le­banon. I re­ally blame the rul­ing class.”</p>
    <p>The blasts were heard as far away as Cyprus, a Mediter­ranean is­land about 240km across the sea from</p>
    <p>Beirut. Vast quan­ti­ties of Le­banon’s wheat and rice sup­plies were de­stroyed, stok­ing fears of short­ages in a na­tion which im­ports nearly all its food.</p>
    <p>The ex­plo­sions came three days be­fore a United Na­tions-backed court is due to de­liver a ver­dict in the trial of four sus­pects from the Shi’ite Mus­lim group Hizbol­lah over a 2005 bomb­ing that killed former prime min­is­ter Rafik al-Hariri and 21 oth­ers.</p>
