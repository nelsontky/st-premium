    <p>MADRID Real Madrid coach Zine­dine Zi­dane paid trib­ute to squad play­ers Lu­cas Vazquez, Na­cho Fer­nan­dez and Marco Asensio af­ter the Span­ish trio made key con­tri­bu­tions to his side’s 2-0 home win over Celta Vigo on Satur­day which pro­vi­sion­ally took the cham­pi­ons one point clear of Atletico Madrid at the top of La Liga.</p>
    <p>Na­cho, who was brought in due to the ab­sence of cap­tain Ser­gio Ramos, pre­vented an early Celta goal by clear­ing a shot from Iago As­pas off the line and Real coun­tered im­me­di­ately to open the scor­ing with a header from Vazquez.</p>
    <p>“Na­cho has be­haved like a pro­fes­sional through­out his ca­reer, not just now, and is al­ways im­por­tant when he plays,” Zi­dane said of the de­fender, who was mak­ing just his sev­enth league ap­pear­ance of the cam­paign.</p>
    <p>“I’m not sur­prised by how well he played, but I’m happy for him and the team be­cause we’ve earned three very im­por­tant points.”</p>
    <p>Asensio had crossed the ball for Vazquez’s opener, and his fel­low for­ward re­turned the favour as Real got their sec­ond early in the sec­ond half.</p>
    <p>Since suf­fer­ing a se­ri­ous knee in­jury in July 2019, Asensio has strug­gled for form and fit­ness but Zi­dane hopes his first goal of the sea­son can lead to bet­ter things.</p>
    <p>“I’m re­ally pleased for Asensio, he had a big in­jury and he’s much bet­ter now and im­prov­ing with ev­ery game,” said the French­man.</p>
    <p>He also praised Vazquez, who re­turned to the side ear­lier in the sea­son as a backup to the in­jured Dani Car­va­jal but has kept his place as a winger since the de­fender’s re­turn.</p>
    <p>The 29-year-old started ahead of record sign­ing Eden Haz­ard at the Al­fredo di Ste­fano Sta­dium on Satur­day and the Bel­gian came on in the sec­ond half.</p>
    <p>“Lu­cas is do­ing so well. He’s very re­li­able, very fo­cused and it was only a mat­ter of time be­fore he started play­ing like this,” Zi­dane said. “We played very well to­day, we keep pick­ing up points and that’s not easy to do.”</p>
    <p>Real topped the stand­ings on 36 points, one ahead of Atletico Madrid be­fore the sec­ond-placed side trav­elled to Alaves late yes­ter­day. The re­sult was not known by press time and Atletico still have two games in hand.</p>
