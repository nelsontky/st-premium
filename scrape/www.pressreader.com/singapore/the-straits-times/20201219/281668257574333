    <p>HONG KONG • As a pan­demic rav­aged the world, Asian economies led by Sin­ga­pore, Hong Kong and Tai­wan topped a rank­ing of most ef­fi­cient health­care sys­tems.</p>
    <p>The Bloomberg Health-Ef­fi­ciency In­dex, first con­ducted in 2013, tracks life ex­pectancy and med­i­cal spend­ing to de­ter­mine which health­care sys­tems have the best out­comes.</p>
    <p>This year’s re­sults in­clude the im­pact of Covid-19 on mor­tal­ity and gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) in 57 of the world’s largest economies.</p>
    <p>Th­ese mea­sures helped many Asian ter­ri­to­ries i mprove their stand­ing on the list since their gen­er­ally ag­gres­sive coro­n­avirus re­sponses kept cases and deaths rel­a­tively low.</p>
    <p>Brazil and Rus­sia joined the United States in the bottom tier, re­flect­ing rel­a­tively l ow life ex­pectan­cies along with high Covid-19 mor­tal­ity and weaker eco­nomic out­looks.</p>
    <p>“Ef­fi­cient health sys­tems are of­ten in places that have lim­ited nat­u­ral re­sources and there­fore pri­ori­tise poli­cies that rely on peo­ple po­ten­tial,” said Pro­fes­sor Pison­thi Chong­trakul i n the Fac­ulty of Medicine at Chu­la­longkorn Univer­sity in Bangkok.</p>
    <p>“Suc­cess in com­bat­ing Covid-19 has come in places that co­or­di­nated among govern­ment bodies and were will­ing to let health ex­perts call the shots, which helped cre­ate a clar­ity of pub­lic mes­sag­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>To mea­sure ef­fi­ciency dur­ing the pan­demic, two ad­just­ments were made to the orig­i­nal rank­ing for­mula: The 2020 ta­ble in­cludes the one-year change in GDP based on an Oc­to­ber fore­cast by the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund, as well as the Covid-19 toll on each econ­omy.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, a 2020 GDP con­trac­tion of 6 per cent led to a six point sub­trac­tion from the to­tal score, while a death toll or new con­firmed cases of 100,000 de­ducted 11.5 points.</p>
    <p>The US ranks among the bottom 10 per cent un­der this method as well as the for­mula used be­fore Covid-19, which sim­ply mea­sured spend­ing against life ex­pectancy. Amer­ica’s low scores re­flect a mid­dling av­er­age life­span, the world’s big­gest out­lays on med­i­cal care, along with the largest Covid-19 caseload.</p>
    <p>Us­ing the for­mula ad­justed for the pan­demic, eight of the world’s 10 most ef­fi­cient health sys­tems are in Asia-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong top the list, while Tai­wan, New Zealand, South Korea and Thai­land leapfrogge­d many ter­ri­to­ries based on their Covid-19 statis­tics.</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic has un­der­scored the fact that eco­nomic health is de­pen­dent on pub­lic health, which is in turn de­pen­dent on ad­e­quate pub­lic spend­ing on health,” said Dr Poonam Khetra­pal Singh, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s South-east Asia di­rec­tor, in a re­port last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>“In or­di­nary times, every dol­lar in­vested in health yields an av­er­age re­turn of be­tween US$2 and US$4, which can be up to 20 times higher in low- and mid­dle-in­come coun­tries,” Dr Singh said.</p>
    <p>In­dia does not meet the min­i­mum met­rics, though it is among the na­tions hard­est hit by the pan­demic.</p>
