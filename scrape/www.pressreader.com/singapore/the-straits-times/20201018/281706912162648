    <p>Con­cerns about over­crowd­ing and safe dis­tanc­ing at the newly opened Changi Jurassic Mile have prompted the Changi Air­port Group (CAG) to im­ple­ment a weekend book­ing sys­tem from now till Jan 3.</p>
    <p>The out­door dis­play of more than 20 di­nosaur mod­els be­tween Ter­mi­nal 4 and the en­trance to East Coast Park, along the 3.5km path con­nect­ing Changi Air­port and the park, has been draw­ing crowds since it opened last week. Vis­i­tors must now re­serve a slot on Changi PlayPass to visit on Fri­days, Satur­days and Sun­days till Jan 3.</p>
    <p>There was a size­able crowd at the Hub & Spoke Cafe near Ter­mi­nal 2, where the path be­gins, when The Sun­day Times team vis­ited around 8am yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Cy­clists thronged the shared path with many stop­ping at the cafe for re­fresh­ments and toi­let breaks.</p>
    <p>Some were con­cerned that the path, which seemed to be about 2m wide, was too nar­row to ac­com­mo­date cy­clists and pedes­tri­ans.</p>
    <p>Flight at­ten­dant Sher­maine Ng, 43, who was cycling with her hus­band, sug­gested it be seg­re­gated with a des­ig­nated lane for cy­clists.</p>
    <p>“The traf­fic was very heavy with a lot of young chil­dren and fam­i­lies with strollers even at 8am, and the path is a bit nar­row,” said Mrs Ng.</p>
    <p>Last week – days af­ter the at­trac­tion was opened – a video of a woman glee­fully rock­ing back and forth on a baby di­nosaur ex­hibit had also started mak­ing the rounds. The hatch­ling emerg­ing from its egg is also miss­ing five teeth. A sign say­ing: “I don’t bite! Don’t pull my teeth!” had been put up be­hind the dis­play when ST vis­ited yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to queries, a CAG spokesman said the ex­hibits are in­stalled for all mem­bers of the pub­lic to share and en­joy, and should be treated with care.</p>
    <p>He added that an ex­hibit has “sus­tained some dam­age, and will be tem­po­rar­ily re­moved for re­pair work”. “We will be adding cau­tion­ary signs along Changi Jurassic Mile to re­mind vis­i­tors not to climb on the ex­hibits. There are also surveil­lance cam­eras in place to mon­i­tor move­ments along the path,” he said.</p>
    <p>The di­nosaur ex­hibits were spe­cially com­mis­sioned by CAG. The spokesman said that Changi Jurassic Mile is part of the Changi Air­port Con­nec­tor, which was bud­geted as a whole project. “The project’s costs fall un­der the over­all devel­op­men­tal costs of Changi Air­port and its var­i­ous de­vel­op­ments and ini­tia­tives,” he said, de­clin­ing to pro­vide fig­ures on the costs due to com­mer­cial sen­si­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Some vis­i­tors at the new at­trac­tion were up­set by the van­dal­ism, and called for penal­ties such as a fine to de­ter peo­ple from dam­ag­ing the dis­plays.</p>
    <p>Mr Den­nis Lui, 50, who was at Changi Jurassic Mile for a morn­ing jog, said: “Van­dal­ism is bad. The di­nosaur ex­hibits are good for kids; they make them ex­cited to take a walk and get some ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>“But it’s tough to pre­vent van­dal­ism or en­force any penal­ties. You can’t re­ally put CCTVs (closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion cam­eras) ev­ery­where,” added Mr Lui.</p>
    <p>Ms Jo­evena Loy, 42, noted that it would also take a lot of work to go through the surveil­lance cam­era footage to iden­tify cul­prits. “Ed­u­cat­ing peo­ple, es­pe­cially chil­dren, is more im­por­tant, as well as fam­ily val­ues and up­bring­ing.”</p>
