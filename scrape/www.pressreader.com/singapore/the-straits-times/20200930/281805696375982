    <p>Amer­ica’s poli­cies on han­dling the Covid-19 out­break are con­stantly up­dated based on the most re­cent find­ings about the virus, said its top coro­n­avirus ex­pert An­thony Fauci.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing dur­ing a we­b­cast dur­ing World News Day cel­e­bra­tions yesterday morn­ing (Mon­day in the United States), Dr Fauci, di­rec­tor of the US Na­tional In­sti­tute of Al­lergy and In­fec­tious Dis­ease, also em­pha­sised that the me­dia has a cru­cial role to play in spread­ing ac­cu­rate in­for­ma­tion, but some do oth­er­wise.</p>
    <p>With a sit­u­a­tion like Covid-19, “which clearly is evolv­ing at a very rapid rate, you make a rec­om­men­da­tion or a pol­icy based on the in­for­ma­tion that you have at a par­tic­u­lar time”, he said. And as more in­for­ma­tion comes in, the au­thor­i­ties need to be “hum­ble enough and flex­i­ble enough” to change some of the orig­i­nal poli­cies.</p>
    <p>“But some of the me­dia who like to make hay of that, keep say­ing ‘Oh you keep chang­ing your mind all the time. Well, you were in­cor­rect’. No, we were cor­rect at the time that state­ment was made. But when the sci­en­tific data made it clear that we had to change that rec­om­menda</p>
    <p>AS THE DATA EVOLVES</p>
    <p>Some of the me­dia who like to make hay of that, keep say­ing ‘Oh you keep chang­ing your mind all the time. Well, you were in­cor­rect’. No, we were cor­rect at the time that state­ment was made. But when the sci­en­tific data made it clear that we had to change that rec­om­men­da­tion, we did.</p>

    <p>(left), di­rec­tor of the US Na­tional In­sti­tute of Al­lergy and In­fec­tious Dis­ease. tion, we did,” said Dr Fauci, cit­ing the ex­am­ple of mask-wear­ing.</p>
    <p>Dr Fauci also said that some me­dia out­lets “give op­pos­ing per­spec­tives on what seems to be a pretty ob­vi­ous fact or a body of data”, cit­ing Amer­i­can out­let Fox News as hav­ing good re­porters but not­ing that “some of the things that they re­port there are out­landish, to be hon­est with you”.</p>
    <p>The ses­sion, which was mod­er­ated by CNN’s chief me­dia cor­re­spon­dent Brian Stel­ter, was part of the two-hour World News Day clos­ing show or­gan­ised by the Cana­dian Jour­nal­ism Foun­da­tion and World Edi­tors Fo­rum.</p>
    <p>The World News Day cel­e­bra­tions had be­gun ear­lier in Sin­ga­pore with a we­bi­nar ti­tled Covid-19: How Can You Con­trib­ute? that was live-streamed from The Straits Times news­room.</p>
    <p>Mr Stel­ter, who also hosted the clos­ing we­b­cast, said in his open­ing re­marks: “When it feels like the an­swers have been in short sup­ply, we have re­lied on jour­nal­ists to chase the truth, we’ve re­lied on jour­nal­ists to con­vey this truth through, and try to cut through the daily flurry of mis­in­for­ma­tion that sur­rounds us more than ever.”</p>
    <p>The two-hour pro­gramme in­cluded dis­cus­sions on a va­ri­ety of top­ics by panel­lists in­clud­ing jour­nal­ists, news­mak­ers, pro­test­ers and pro­fes­sional ath­letes.</p>
    <p>Mr Os­car Jimenez, a CNN cor­re­spon­dent based in Chicago, spoke about how he got ar­rested while re­port­ing on live tele­vi­sion about a protest in Min­neapo­lis over the death of an un­armed black man in po­lice cus­tody.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Geographic’s se­nior en­vi­ron­ment edi­tor Robert Kun­zig and se­nior ex­ec­u­tive edi­tor Indira Lak­sh­manan also had a chat about the on­go­ing cli­mate cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Google’s vice-pres­i­dent of news Richard Gin­gras shared his view about the im­pact of lo­cal news, mis­in­for­ma­tion and the pres­sures that big tech firms face.</p>
    <p>In the clos­ing seg­ment, Philip­pine news web­site Rap­pler co­founder Maria Ressa spoke with ABC7 News re­porter Kris Reyes about the cur­rent state of press free­dom.</p>
    <p>Ms Ressa said that while so­cial me­dia started off very promis­ingly, it went south as au­thor­i­tar­ian regimes were able to con­trol peo­ple’s be­hav­iour based on the data col­lected, and by sup­press­ing the spread of in­for­ma­tion by tar­get­ing jour­nal­ists.</p>
    <p>“By next year, I’d have been a jour­nal­ist for 35 years. I’ve never been un­der at­tack as much as I have to­day, just for do­ing my job. It is worse than a war zone, it’s worse than any con­flict zone. And I guess that brings it home – that is the con­flict zone, that is the war zone. The war is for facts,” she said.</p>
