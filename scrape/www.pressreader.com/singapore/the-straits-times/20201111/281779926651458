    <p>SYD­NEY • Aus­tralia is con­sid­er­ing open­ing its borders to Asian coun­tries, in­clud­ing parts of China, Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son said yes­ter­day, as Can­berra seeks to re­vive an econ­omy rav­aged by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In March, Aus­tralia closed its borders to all non-cit­i­zens and per­ma­nent res­i­dents, though Can­berra last month al­lowed New Zealand res­i­dents to en­ter. In­ter­nal travel is lim­ited, but those re­stric­tions are sched­uled to be re­moved by year end.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son ruled out en­try to peo­ple from the United States or Europe, but said Aus­tralia may al­low peo­ple from low-risk places such as Tai­wan, Ja­pan, Sin­ga­pore and even prov­inces in China.</p>
    <p>“(We) are look­ing at what al­ter­na­tive ar­range­ments could be had to chan­nel vis­i­tors through ap­pro­pri­ate quar­an­tine ar­range­ments for low-risk coun­tries,” Mr Mor­ri­son told re­porters.</p>
    <p>China was one of the first coun­tries from which Aus­tralia re­stricted en­try.</p>
    <p>The con­sid­er­a­tion of eas­ing travel curbs comes as Mr Mor­ri­son said Aus­tralia has gone three days with­out any lo­cally ac­quired cases of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>All de­tected cases have been quar­an­tined lo­cals who have re­cently re­turned from overseas.</p>
    <p>Re­viv­ing tourism would give a much-needed boost to Aus­tralia’s econ­omy, which shrank 7 per cent in the three months that ended in June, the most since records be­gan in 1959.</p>
    <p>Tourism in 2019 ac­counted for 3.1 per cent of the coun­try’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, con­tribut­ing al­most A$61 bil­lion (S$59.8 bil­lion) to the econ­omy, gov­ern­ment data shows.</p>
    <p>Al­though many Aus­tralians are tak­ing hol­i­days lo­cally, many tourism op­er­a­tors are strug­gling and have been forced to shed staff.</p>
    <p>Unem­ploy­ment ticked up to 6.9 per cent in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son said Aus­tralia would ex­tend higher unem­ploy­ment ben­e­fits un­til the end of March next year, though at a re­duced rate.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently those un­em­ployed re­ceive A$815 ev­ery two weeks, but this will fall to A$715 at the end of De­cem­ber.</p>
