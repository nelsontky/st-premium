    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump on Tues­day night ac­knowl­edged that coro­n­avirus cases are ris­ing in “cer­tain ar­eas” of the Mid­west, a rare ad­mis­sion dur­ing the fi­nal week in the bat­tle for the White House.</p>
    <p>“Cer­tain ar­eas that are heated up right now,” Mr Trump said at a rally in Omaha, Nebraska. “They’ll go down. They’ll go down very quickly. They’ll be down within two weeks, they’re fig­ur­ing.”</p>
    <p>He has rou­tinely down­played the virus while mak­ing his clos­ing ar­gu­ment to vot­ers, who have rated his pan­demic re­sponse poorly, ac­cord­ing to opin­ion polls. Through­out his pres­i­dency, he has promised re­sults for var­i­ous ini­tia­tives in two weeks.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent said again on Tues­day that the coun­try is “turn­ing that cor­ner” and pledged the virus would go away with or with­out a vac­cine. He ac­cused the news me­dia of cov­er­ing the pan­demic to dam­age him po­lit­i­cally and said the day af­ter Elec­tion Day, “you won’t be hear­ing that much” about it.</p>
    <p>Coro­n­avirus cases are soar­ing in states across the United States and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions are up at least 10 per cent in the past week in 32 states.</p>
    <p>Out­breaks in Mid­west­ern states have driven the most re­cent surge. As a re­gion, the Mid­west’s sev­en­day av­er­age of cases has fallen slightly, but is still near a record.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the day, Mr Trump also held an open-air rally in Michi­gan, fol­lowed by events in Wis­con­sin.</p>
    <p>Michi­gan and Wis­con­sin are Mid­west­ern bat­tle­grounds that he won by ra­zor-thin mar­gins four years ago, but Mr Trump in­sisted “we’re lead­ing al­most ev­ery­where”, thanks to his fran­tic cam­paign sched­ule.</p>
    <p>“I’ve got to say I’m work­ing my a** off here!” he boomed in Lans­ing, Michi­gan, elic­it­ing a huge cheer.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent said his pan­demic poli­cies and eco­nomic chops would serve the na­tion bet­ter than his Demo­cratic ri­val Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>“This elec­tion is a choice be­tween a Trump su­per-re­cov­ery or Bi­den de­pres­sion,” he said.</p>
    <p>But with Covid-19 cases still ris­ing and no agree­ment yet on a pan­demic res­cue pack­age in Congress, US stocks mostly slid on Tues­day for a third straight ses­sion.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, First Lady Me­la­nia Trump on Tues­day hit the cam­paign trail for her hus­band for the first time on her own this year.</p>
    <p>“Don­ald is a fighter. He loves this coun­try and he fights for you ev­ery sin­gle day,” Mrs Trump, 50, told the Pres­i­dent’s sup­port­ers in Penn­syl­va­nia, a key bat­tle­ground state.</p>
    <p>She of­fered com­pas­sion to fam­i­lies of those who have suc­cumbed to Covid-19 so far this year.</p>
    <p>“I know there are many peo­ple who have lost loved ones or know peo­ple who have been for­ever im­pacted by this si­lent en­emy,” she said. “My fam­ily’s thoughts and prayers are with all of you... We will tri­umph over this virus.”</p>
    <p>In her speech, she also of­fered a few com­ments about her hus­band’s ra­bid Twit­ter use.</p>
    <p>“For the first time in history, the cit­i­zens of this coun­try get to hear di­rectly and in­stantly from their pres­i­dent ev­ery sin­gle day through so­cial me­dia,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I do not al­ways agree with the way he says things,” she added, to some laugh­ter from the crowd.</p>
    <p>“But it is im­por­tant to him that he speaks di­rectly to the peo­ple he serves.”</p>
    <p>RARE AD­MIS­SION</p>
    <p>Cer­tain ar­eas that are heated up right now... They’ll go down. They’ll go down very quickly. They’ll be down within two weeks, they’re fig­ur­ing.</p>
