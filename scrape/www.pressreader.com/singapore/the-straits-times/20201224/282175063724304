    <p>• Con­tainer ship­ping, the back­bone of the global trad­ing sys­tem, is show­ing signs of fa­tigue as the pan­demic de­scends into its dark­est days.</p>
    <p>Car­ri­ers reap­ing the big­gest prof­its in at least a decade are strug­gling to op­er­ate re­li­ably as bot­tle­necks worsen around ports from south­ern Eng­land to Shang­hai, con­tort­ing sup­ply chains for ev­ery­thing from car parts to cos­met­ics to med­i­cal equip­ment.</p>
    <p>Just 50.1 per cent of con­tainer ves­sels ar­rived on time last month, down from 80 per cent a year ear­lier, and the low­est level in records dat­ing back to 2011, ac­cord­ing to a ser­vice re­li­a­bil­ity in­dex compiled by Copenhagen-based Sea-In­tel­li­gence, an anal­y­sis and data provider.</p>
    <p>De­lays can add costs, i nduce op­er­a­tional headaches and re­strain rev­enue for the ship­pers of cargo – com­pa­nies like Costco Whole­sale.</p>
    <p>The Is­saquah, Wash­ing­ton-based chain of 803 ware­house-size stores on four con­ti­nents ex­pects the sit­u­a­tion in­volv­ing con­tainer short­ages and late de­liv­er­ies to per­sist for a few more months.</p>
    <p>“There are in­stances of 50 per cent or 100 per cent or even more sale in­creases of an item, and if we could pro­cure more, we’d have even higher sales,” Mr Richard Galanti, Costco’s chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer, said on a con­fer­ence call ear­lier this month. “We’re manag­ing through it, and ex­pect relief not un­til March or so of 2021.”</p>
    <p>Slowly clog­ging up since Septem­ber, the main artery for trade between China and the United States is still choked.</p>
    <p>An­chored off the coast of Cal­i­for­nia over the week­end were al­most 20 con­tainer ships wait­ing to off­load at Los An­ge­les and Long Beach, up from about a dozen at the end of last month.</p>
    <p>The Port of Los An­ge­les ex­pects to han­dle 152,000 in­bound con­tain­ers this week – a 94 per cent in­crease from the same week a year ago.</p>
    <p>Mr We­ston LaBar, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Har­bour Truck­ing As­so­ci­a­tion in Long Beach, last month ex­pected con­tainer vol­ume through the LA ports to sta­bilise by mid-Fe­bru­ary, when Chi­nese fac­to­ries typ­i­cally shut down for Chi­nese New Year.</p>
    <p>“Now we’re hear­ing al­ready about a lot of book­ings through June and July,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Alan Mur­phy, CEO of Sea-In­tel­li­gence, cau­tioned that the cur­rent im­bal­ances in con­tain­ers are con­cen­trated in North Amer­ica and said the strength of de­mand prob­a­bly will not be sus­tained if Covid-19 vac­cines en­able US con­sumers to quickly shift spend­ing back to ser­vices like travel and hos­pi­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>The ship­ping dis­rup­tions should calm down in the first half of next year, he said, but do not ex­pect the con­tainer lin­ers to make their over­ca­pac­ity mis­takes of the past, which in­cluded un­der-bid­ding in freight rate con­tracts to be­low break-even lev­els.</p>
    <p>“The game has changed fun­da­men­tally – not be­cause of the coro­n­avirus, but be­cause of how the car­ri­ers re­sponded,” he said, re­fer­ring to a sharp re­duc­tion in sail­ings in the pan­demic’s early months. “They are now ca­pa­ble of tai­lor­ing their sup­ply to the avail­able de­mand at a tac­ti­cal level that they’ve never been able to do be­fore.”</p>
    <p>That is what wor­ries freight for­warders and other ship­pers, and the con­cerns ex­tend be­yond the trou­bles in the Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Ship­pers’ Coun­cil, a Brus­sels­based group rep­re­sent­ing cargo own­ers, is cry­ing foul about “de­graded ser­vices” and sur­charges, and wants the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion to look into the mar­ket dy­nam­ics.</p>
    <p>The main stick­ing point: Spot rates to trans­port goods, which typ­i­cally fade in the fi­nal weeks of the year, are still soar­ing de­spite the ser­vice dis­rup</p>
    <p>tions. The rate to ship a con­tainer of goods from China to Europe jumped 17 per cent last week, tre­bling from a year ago to over US$4,400 (S$5,900), ac­cord­ing to Hong Kong-based Freightos, an on­line ship­ping mar­ket­place.</p>
    <p>“Of course we want the ship­ping lines to be healthy,” said Mr Jordi Espin, the coun­cil’s pol­icy man­ager for mar­itime trans­port. “How­ever, to make these kinds of prof­its when we’re in pan­demic res­cue mode, we don’t think it’s fair.”</p>
    <p>Ship­pers and con­tainer lin­ers are al­ways spar­ring over prices and re­li­a­bil­ity. But the pan­demic has spot­lighted the up­per hand that the lin­ers now have af­ter a decade of con­sol­i­dat­ing and form­ing al­liances among them­selves, said Mr Olaf Merk, head of ports and ship­ping at the Paris-based Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and Devel­op­ment’s In­ter­na­tional Trans­port Fo­rum.</p>
    <p>“That is some­thing that the com­pe­ti­tion au­thor­i­ties will have to look at, I think, and some are also do­ing it now,” Mr Merk said, re­fer­ring to the US Fed­eral Mar­itime Com­mis­sion’s in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the car­ri­ers’ role in Amer­i­can port con­ges­tion. “The sit­u­a­tion which we are now in gives a lot of pos­si­bil­i­ties to the car­ri­ers to co­or­di­nate ca­pac­ity and that, of course, in­creases the risks for ship­pers.”</p>
    <p>The world’s top con­tainer line, Copenhagen-based AP MollerMaer­sk, this month called the chal­lenges “the most dra­matic stress test of the past 75 years”.</p>
    <p>Other in­dus­try rep­re­sen­ta­tives said there are mul­ti­ple rea­sons on land for why the sys­tem is strain­ing, such as trucker short­ages, surg­ing e-com­merce pur­chases or Brexit stock­pil­ing. Stuffed with 20 per cent to 30 per cent more cargo than it is used to han­dling, the pipe­line is bound to face some snarls.</p>
    <p>“Even with this Covid cargo crunch that we’re now in the mid­dle of, things con­tinue to move,” said Mr John But­ler, pres­i­dent of the World Ship­ping Coun­cil in Wash­ing­ton, which counts the big liner com­pa­nies among its mem­bers. “When you so sig­nif­i­cantly over­load the sys­tem, it doesn’t im­me­di­ately snap back.”</p>
    <p>Mr But­ler dis­missed the no­tion that the in­dus­try lacks com­pet­i­tive­ness, call­ing it “cut-throat frankly”.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, shares of Maersk are flirt­ing at an all-time high and the in­dus­try more broadly banked prof­its of US$5.1 bil­lion in the third quar­ter, a four­fold in­crease from a year ear­lier. With a solid fourth quar­ter, the cu­mu­la­tive red ink of the past five years will be­come net prof­itabil­ity, ac­cord­ing to fig­ures compiled by Mr John McCown, a con­tainer-in­dus­try vet­eran and founder of Blue Alpha Cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>He said the pan­demic gave the con­tainer car­ri­ers a les­son about how to hold firm on ca­pac­ity as they shift into a longer-term pe­riod of slower de­mand growth.</p>
    <p>Among the tur­moil of the year: over­worked mariners and cy­ber at­tacks. But one of the more re­mark­able events hap­pened on Nov 30, when the Ja­panese-flagged One Apus hit rough seas sail­ing from China to the US, send­ing more than 1,800 con­tain­ers over­board.</p>
    <p>The ship and crew re­turned safely to Kobe, Ja­pan.</p>
