    <p>The At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) has re­but­ted claims made by lawyer M. Ravi that prose­cu­tors were “overzeal­ous” in their pros­e­cu­tion of former death row in­mate Gobi Ave­dian.</p>
    <p>Gobi, 32, es­caped the gal­lows yes­ter­day when Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon, to­gether with Judges of Ap­peal An­drew Phang, Ju­dith Prakash, Tay Yong Kwang and Steven Chong, re­viewed and over­turned an ear­lier de­ci­sion by the Court of Ap­peal.</p>
    <p>He was in­stead sen­tenced to 15 years’ jail and 10 strokes of the cane, with the sen­tence back­dated to the date of his re­mand.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the course of a video interview up­loaded to The On­line Cit­i­zen’s Face­book page yes­ter­day, Mr Ravi al­leged that the Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor was “overzeal­ous” in the pros­e­cu­tion of Gobi.</p>
    <p>He also said that there had been a “mis­car­riage of jus­tice” in Gobi’s case.</p>
    <p>“The state and the pros­e­cu­tion has been overzeal­ous in its pros­e­cu­tion and that has led to Gobi’s death sen­tence,” Mr Ravi said, adding that the “state, pros­e­cu­tion and the Min­is­ter of Law should apol­o­gise to Gobi”.</p>
    <p>He fur­ther sug­gested that “the ap­pli­ca­tion process and the statu­tory mech­a­nism” put in place for the Court of Ap­peal to re­view such pre­vi­ous de­ci­sions was “op­pres­sive”.</p>
    <p>The AGC re­but­ted the lawyer’s claims, say­ing Mr Ravi was in­sin­u­at­ing that the ini­tial con­vic­tion of Gobi was wrong at the time it was de­cided and that the Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor had acted im­prop­erly.</p>
    <p>“Any such in­sin­u­a­tion is cat­e­gor­i­cally false. The Court of Ap­peal in the de­ci­sion is­sued to­day ex­plic­itly pointed out that its ini­tial de­ci­sion to con­vict the ap­pli­cant was ‘cor­rect at the time (it was) made’ and that none of the ar­gu­ments con­sid­ered in the de­ci­sion de­liv­ered to­day ‘could have been made in view of the le­gal po­si­tion as it was un­der­stood then’,” said the AGC in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“It is un­for­tu­nate that Mr Ravi has sought to mis­char­ac­terise the rea­sons for the de­ci­sion is­sued by the Court of Ap­peal to­day.”</p>
    <p>The AGC re­sponded as well to Mr Ravi’s sug­ges­tion that the ap­pli­ca­tion process for re­view by the Court of Ap­peal was op­pres­sive.</p>
    <p>“Con­trary to Mr Ravi’s base­less as­ser­tion, as the Court of Ap­peal af­firmed, such statu­tory frame­work ‘is a re­flec­tion of the ro­bust­ness of our le­gal frame­work that the Court may in lim­ited cir­cum­stances take into ac­count sub­se­quent changes in the le­gal po­si­tion to re­assess pre­vi­ously made de­ci­sions’,” the AGC said.</p>
    <p>The AGC re­but­ted the lawyer’s claims, say­ing Mr M. Ravi was in­sin­u­at­ing that the ini­tial con­vic­tion of Gobi Ave­dian was wrong at the time it was de­cided and that the Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor had acted im­prop­erly.</p>
