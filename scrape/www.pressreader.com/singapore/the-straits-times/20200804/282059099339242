    <p>A memo­rial ser­vice has been held in Perth for a Sin­ga­porean stu­dent who was swept out to sea on June 29, fol­low­ing DNA tests that con­firmed his re­mains were found, more than two weeks af­ter he went miss­ing.</p>
    <p>The ser­vice was hosted last Thurs­day by Mr Goh Heng Yi’s school, the Univer­sity of Western Aus­tralia (UWA), a day af­ter the con­fir­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old was swept out to sea by a wave on June 29 at In­jidup Na­ture Spa – a nat­u­ral rock for­ma­tion at In­jidup Beach on Aus­tralia’s western coast, about 260km south of Perth. A five-day search ef­fort was mounted, but was sus­pended by the West Aus­tralian po­lice on July 3.</p>
    <p>On July 16, hu­man re­mains were found near where the stu­dent went miss­ing, and DNA sam­ples from Mr Goh’s fam­ily mem­bers were taken to help in the iden­ti­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>His fa­ther, a 64-year-old re­tiree who wanted to be known only as Mr Goh, told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that a se­cond memo­rial ser­vice for his son’s rel­a­tives and friends in Sin­ga­pore would be held at a later time.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day’s ser­vice at UWA, where Mr Goh was pur­su­ing a mas­ter’s de­gree in eco­nom­ics, was at­tended by about 100 peo­ple, in­clud­ing fac­ulty heads, lec­tur­ers, staff of the univer­sity, friends of the vic­tim and fam­ily friends.</p>
    <p>Close to 300 rel­a­tives and friends from Sin­ga­pore also at­tended the ser­vice via live stream­ing. “(The turnout) shows how well-liked and well-loved Heng Yi was, and I am very proud of him,” said Mr Goh.</p>
    <p>He added that the past five weeks had been ex­tremely painful for his fam­ily, but they are grate­ful to have clo­sure. “Bid­ding farewell to our son Heng Yi is one of the hard­est things I have ever had to do in my life,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Words can­not de­scribe the pain, sor­row and loss that I am feel­ing now. How­ever, I be­lieve my son is in a bet­ter place now. I be­lieve that he is now in the good hands of God, well pro­tected and loved by God. We will miss him dearly, but he will live in our hearts for­ever.”</p>
    <p>The re­mains of Mr Goh, the younger of two sons, were cre­mated in Perth last Fri­day, and his fam­ily will bring his ashes back to Sin­ga­pore to­day.</p>
