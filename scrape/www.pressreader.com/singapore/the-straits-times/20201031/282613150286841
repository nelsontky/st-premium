    <p>LONDON • Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) are seek­ing to raise fund­ing via debt and eq­uity mar­kets as the coro­n­avirus cri­sis and low com­mod­ity prices stretch state fi­nances.</p>
    <p>Many SWFs have tra­di­tion­ally re­lied on cash fun­nelled from their gov­ern­ments to sup­port the bulk of their fi­nances, but re­cent moves could in­di­cate a shift. For ex­am­ple, In­vest­ment Cor­po­ra­tion of Dubai this month sold US$600 mil­lion (S$819 mil­lion) in bonds, while Turkey’s sovereign in­vest­ment fund was also plan­ning a bond is­sue, but post­poned the move due to mar­ket volatil­ity.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, In­done­sia is pre­par­ing to es­tab­lish an SWF with govern­ment cap­i­tal and shares in state-owned com­pa­nies, com­ple­mented by pri­vate in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>Dji­bouti plans to ex­pand its newly launched fund to US$1.5 bil­lion in as­sets un­der man­age­ment over the next decade. While it has not said how it plans to do so, an­a­lysts an­tic­i­pate par­tic­i­pa­tion from pub­lic and pri­vate in­vestors.</p>
    <p>Al­though some funds did raise money via eq­uity and debt mar­kets be­fore the pan­demic, more are ex­pected to turn to those op­tions as Covid-19 ex­acts a heavy cost on gov­ern­ments while sub­dued eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity weighs on re­turns of ex­ist­ing in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>“It is def­i­nitely an in­creas­ing trend among sovereign devel­op­ment funds, per­haps in or­der to al­le­vi­ate the debt at coun­try level,” noted Mr Diego Lopez, Global SWF’s manag­ing di­rec­tor, re­fer­ring to those funds that had a man­date to help foster growth in their lo­cal economies.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, gov­ern­ments in sev­eral coun­tries have drawn down sav­ings from their funds in the months af­ter the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Rel­a­tively low prices for com­modi­ties and large fis­cal re­sponses to the pan­demic en­tail lit­tle to no govern­ment bud­get sur­plus to be con­trib­uted to the as­sets un­der man­age­ment of sovereign wealth funds,” said Utrecht Univer­sity School of Eco­nomics’ as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of fi­nance Ste­fano Lugo.</p>
    <p>“In some coun­tries, the govern­ment may even de­cide to with­draw from SWFs to pay for its fis­cal stim­u­lus plans. Us­ing debt cap­i­tal can par­tially coun­ter­bal­ance th­ese trends.”</p>
    <p>RISKS V RE­WARDS</p>
    <p>Rais­ing money via eq­uity mar­kets was not un­com­mon be­fore the pan­demic, with the Rus­sian Di­rect In­vest­ment Fund and In­dia’s Na­tional In­vest­ment and In­fra­struc­ture Fund among those turn­ing to pri­vate in­vestors to sup­port in­vest­ments at home.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Te­masek, Mubadala In­vest­ment Com­pany of Abu Dhabi, Malaysia’s Khaz­anah Na­sional, Sam­ruk Kazyna of Kaza­khstan and Mum­ta­lakat of Bahrain were among those funds that raised debt pre-pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to data from Global SWF.</p>
    <p>The lat­est es­ti­mates for the amount of debt ac­cu­mu­lated by SWFs are un­clear.</p>
    <p>Re­search from Mr Lugo and his col­league Fabio Ber­toni from 2016 found that they had out­stand­ing debt of around US$180 bil­lion, a fig­ure likely to have risen since then, said Mr Lugo.</p>
    <p>But is­su­ing and buy­ing debt is not with­out risk. “The main com­par­a­tive ad­van­tage of SWFs as in­vestors is their abil­ity to keep a very long-term view,” said Mr Lugo.</p>
    <p>“Debt-ser­vic­ing obli­ga­tions may par­tially un­der­mine this ad­van­tage. I see this as the main risk of us­ing debt cap­i­tal for most SWFs.”</p>
    <p>Debt-rais­ing can also cre­ate un­cer­tainty about how likely it is that gov­ern­ments will guar­an­tee the debt, some­thing that can vary among coun­tries. For in­stance, Fitch Rat­ings, which re­vised its rat­ing out­look on Turkey Wealth Fund to neg­a­tive last month, as­sesses the govern­ment as hav­ing a “strong” link to the fund and hav­ing an “in­cen­tive to pro­vide ex­tra­or­di­nary sup­port” if needed.</p>
