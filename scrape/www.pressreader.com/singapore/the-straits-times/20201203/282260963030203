    <p>THIRD-QUAR­TER GROWTH IN AUS­TRALIA’S ECON­OMY, END­ING ITS FIRST RE­CES­SION IN 30 YEARS |</p>
    <p>• Aus­tralia has ex­ited its first re­ces­sion in al­most 30 years, af­ter of­fi­cial fig­ures re­leased yes­ter­day showed the econ­omy grew 3.3 per cent in July-Septem­ber com­pared with the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>With l ocal trans­mis­sion of Covid-19 largely un­der con­trol, of­fi­cial data showed busi­nesses have be­gun to re­bound and con­sumer spend­ing has surged.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian Bureau of Statis­tics said house­hold spend­ing largely drove the eco­nomic bounce, rising 7.9 per cent com­pared with the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>How­ever, cen­tral bank gov­er­nor Philip Lowe warned that pos­i­tive eco­nomic in­di­ca­tors masked lin­ger­ing dif­fi­cul­ties.</p>
    <p>“These fig­ures... can­not hide the re­al­ity that the re­cov­ery will be un­even and bumpy and that it will be drawn out,” he told law­mak­ers yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s econ­omy has yet to fully re­cover from the coro­n­avirus-fu­elled re­ces­sion, record­ing a 3.8 per cent slump for the year to Septem­ber. The re­turn to eco­nomic growth fol­lowed a 7 per cent de­cline in the June quar­ter and a 0.3 per cent dip in the first quar­ter of this year.</p>
    <p>The pos­i­tive growth comes de­spite Vic­to­ria state – which ac­counts for about 25 per cent of Aus­tralia’s eco­nomic out­put – spend­ing much of the Septem­ber quar­ter in one of the world’s strictest lock­downs, cur­tail­ing eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity there.</p>
    <p>Eco­nomic shut­downs to curb the spread of Covid-19 sent Aus­tralia tum­bling into re­ces­sion as whole in­dus­tries ground to a halt. Around a mil­lion peo­ple lost their jobs and many more were forced to take pay cuts or saw their hours slashed.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, the gov­ern­ment and the cen­tral bank have em­barked on a vast stim­u­lus spend­ing pro­gramme, pump­ing bil­lions into the econ­omy to avert a full-blown de­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>Last month, the Re­serve Bank of Aus­tralia cut in­ter­est rates to a record low of 0.1 per cent to help has­ten the re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Higher un­em­ploy­ment is set to linger, with the job­less rate rising to 7 per cent in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Closed bor­ders con­tinue to drag on the econ­omy, with trade de­tract­ing 1.9 per­cent­age points from gross do­mes­tic prod­uct in the Septem­ber quar­ter as ex­ports fell due to weaker de­mand for Aus­tralian min­ing com­modi­ties and travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has been rel­a­tively suc­cess­ful in its pan­demic health re­sponse, record­ing just un­der 28,000 cases and over 900 deaths.</p>
