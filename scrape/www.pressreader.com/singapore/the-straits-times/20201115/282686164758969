    <p>Mr Richard Chai, 50, is no stranger to tech­nol­ogy, hav­ing pro­grammed sur­veil­lance and in­spec­tion ro­bots in a pre­vi­ous job.</p>
    <p>But he still had some con­cerns in Septem­ber last year, when he was about to start a six-month in­tern­ship to build a chat­bot at the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) Board.</p>
    <p>“I was wor­ried about how my col­leagues would re­act to an in­tern who could pos­si­bly be much older than them. The tech AI (ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence) field is usu­ally filled with news of young IT stars. Would an old man be ac­cepted?”</p>
    <p>The business grad­u­ate, who also has a spe­cial­ist di­ploma in AI, added: “I was also wor­ried about how I would re­act, my own emo­tional state in deal­ing with a new set­ting.”</p>
    <p>The ex­pe­ri­ence turned out to be much bet­ter than he had ex­pected, as his su­per­vi­sor gave him many op­por­tu­ni­ties to try dif­fer­ent ideas to cre­ate the chat­bot, write Python pro­grams and learn ro­botic process au­to­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Chai even­tu­ally rec­om­mended against us­ing the planned sys­tem to cre­ate the chat­bot, and re­ceived the full sup­port of his su­pe­ri­ors.</p>
    <p>Col­leagues from other de­part­ments were also very wel­com­ing, and they even gave him choco­lates dur­ing Christ­mas, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Chai was of­fered a full-time po­si­tion in April this year and now works as a business an­a­lyst.</p>
    <p>His in­tern­ship su­per­vi­sor, 31-year-old Tan Bing Wen, said his cu­rios­ity, ea­ger­ness to ven­ture be­yond his com­fort zone and sunny out­look dur­ing the in­ter­view were what landed him the in­tern­ship.</p>
    <p>Al­though Mr Tan is much younger than Mr Chai, he found</p>
    <p>that, like man­ag­ing any­one, “it all boils down to com­mu­ni­ca­tion, mu­tual un­der­stand­ing and em­pa­thy”.</p>
    <p>“The dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives and ex­pe­ri­ences a ma­ture in­tern can bring can def­i­nitely make it worth­while,” Mr Tan added.</p>
    <p>Mr Chai came across the CPF Board’s in­tern­ship post when he was look­ing at AI-re­lated jobs on LinkedIn to find out what spe­cific AI skills or projects were in de­mand, as he re­alised he lacked real-world ex­pe­ri­ence in the field.</p>
    <p>He took a leap of faith to leave his job as an ap­pli­ca­tion en­gi­neer­ing man­ager in an en­gi­neer­ing soft­ware com­pany to be­come an in­tern. As the monthly al­lowance of $1,200 was not enough to cover his fam­ily ex­penses for his house­hold, daugh­ter and mother, he had to dip into his sav­ings.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, this was a path I chose to take and I have no com­plaints and def­i­nitely no re­grets.”</p>
    <p>Mr Chai is cur­rently pur­su­ing a Mas­ter of Tech­nol­ogy in In­tel­li­gent Sys­tems through a stack­able route at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s In­sti­tute of Sys­tems Sci­ence, which means he stud­ies at his own pace and can stack grad­u­ate cer­tifi­cates and a cap­stone project into a mas­ter’s qual­i­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>His ad­vice for other ma­ture in­terns: “First, un­der­stand deeply why you have de­cided to take on the in­tern­ship, so that if you face dif­fi­cul­ties – which you prob­a­bly will, es­pe­cially if you’ve switched to a new field – you will find it eas­ier to steady your­self.</p>
    <p>“Also, lis­ten very care­fully be­fore of­fer­ing any sug­ges­tions, re­sist the temp­ta­tion to as­sume that you al­ready have the an­swers due to your pre­vi­ous ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>The dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives and ex­pe­ri­ences a ma­ture in­tern can bring can def­i­nitely make it worth­while.</p>
