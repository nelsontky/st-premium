    <p>Small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) will be get­ting more help to ac­cess gov­ern­ment sup­port, with a new on­line ad­viser to point them to schemes most suit­able for them.</p>
    <p>Such help is es­pe­cially im­por­tant as com­pa­nies try to trans­form them­selves and dig­i­talise, a process made more ur­gent by the coro­n­avirus pandemic.</p>
    <p>The on­line ad­viser initiative, which will be launched next Tues­day, was an­nounced by Min­is­ter of State for Trade and In­dus­try Low Yen Ling yes­ter­day at a vir­tual con­fer­ence or­gan­ised by the SME Cen­tres.</p>
    <p>There are 11 cen­tres that pro­vide busi­ness ad­vice to firms and help them up­grade their ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Ms Low said: “One com­mon feed­back we have re­ceived from SMEs is the dif­fi­culty (they face in) nav­i­gat­ing the suite of avail­able gov­ern­ment schemes.</p>
    <p>“They find it hard to find the schemes they can qual­ify for and to know which ones are best suited for their needs.”</p>
    <p>The new on­line ad­viser will sug­gest a se­lec­tion of schemes that can help com­pa­nies, based on the an­swers they give to a few short ques­tions on their busi­ness.</p>
    <p>This com­ple­ments the ef­forts of busi­ness ad­vis­ers at SME Cen­tres and also pro­vides round-the-clock help for firms.</p>
    <p>It is part of the Gov­ern­ment’s larger GoBusi­ness plat­form.</p>
    <p>As of last month, En­ter­prise Sin</p>
    <p>Go­ing dig­i­tal has cre­ated a new rev­enue stream for the SME, and this is likely to con­tinue grow­ing ’’ even af­ter the pandemic.</p>
    <p>MIN­IS­TER OF STATE LOW YEN LING, on Mer­lin Gold­smith’s move to e-com­merce.</p>
    <p>gapore (ESG) had re­ceived more than 18,000 ap­pli­ca­tions from SMEs for the Pro­duc­tiv­ity So­lu­tions Grant, as they seek to dig­i­talise their busi­ness pro­cesses and ex­pand their cus­tomer base.</p>
    <p>At least 10,000 of these ap­pli­ca­tions were for Covid-19 busi­ness con­ti­nu­ity mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The grant de­frays up to 80 per cent of the cost of fund­ing dig­i­tal so­lu­tions to make firms more ef­fi­cient and com­pet­i­tive.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment is also help­ing en­ter­prises by tak­ing on 90 per cent of the risk on loans sup­ported by ESG – an initiative that will con­tinue un­til March next year.</p>
    <p>From March to June this year, more than 10,600 en­ter­prises took up about $9.4 bil­lion in loans, which is seven times the credit ex­tended through ESG’s loan pro­grammes last year.</p>
    <p>More than 80 per cent of these loans were given to mi­cro and small en­ter­prises with less than $10 mil­lion in an­nual rev­enue.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has ac­cel­er­ated the growth and op­por­tu­ni­ties in e-com­merce in new ways... E-com­merce ca­pa­bil­i­ties are more crit­i­cal than ever,” Ms Low said.</p>
    <p>“With safe dis­tanc­ing, con­sumers are shift­ing to­wards on­line shop­ping and this trend is likely to per­sist even af­ter Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>One ex­am­ple of a busi­ness head­ing on­line is j ewellery re­tailer Mer­lin Gold­smith, which has ex­panded from a tra­di­tional shop in Lit­tle In­dia to hav­ing a boom­ing ecom­merce pres­ence.</p>
    <p>When shops had to close dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, it shifted to sell­ing on­line. It has boosted its on­line sales by 50 per cent in the past few months through so­cial me­dia and by grow­ing a loyal cus­tomer base.</p>
    <p>Ms Low said: “This ex­pe­ri­ence has not only val­i­dated the de­ci­sion to in­vest in staff train­ing, but also over­turned the own­ers’ pre­vi­ous as­sump­tion that cus­tomers would not be will­ing to buy lux­ury goods on­line.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing dig­i­tal has cre­ated a new rev­enue stream for the SME, and this is likely to con­tinue grow­ing even af­ter the pandemic.”</p>
