    <p>Ra­dio pre­sen­ter Shan Wee has a new book and it is not a se­quel to his tongue-in-cheek guide on fa­ther­hood, 99 Rules For New Dads.</p>
    <p>In­stead, it is a dark crime thriller. “My mar­riage broke down in 2017, the same year my ‘funny dad par­ent­ing book’ was pub­lished.</p>
    <p>“I felt like a big fraud pro­mot­ing a book about be­ing a good dad, when I couldn’t keep our own fam­ily unit to­gether,” the 38-year-old tells The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Wee hosts The Sweet Spot on week­days from 10am to 1pm on Kiss92 FM, where he is also mu­sic direc­tor.</p>
    <p>He and his for­mer wife Ar­tika Su­laiman have been di­vorced and co-par­ent­ing for three years. The cou­ple tied the knot in 2011 and have two sons, aged eight and six.</p>
    <p>“Now, 2017 feels like a long time ago, as does that par­ent­ing book, and I am happy to leave it con­signed to the past,” says Wee, adding that he does not plan to write par­ent­ing books again.</p>
    <p>But he has al­ways dreamt about be­ing “a real writer” and pub­lish­ing a work of fic­tion.</p>
    <p>This dream comes true to­mor­row, when he launches his new novel, The Short Life Of Raven Mon­roe.</p>
    <p>Set in the United States, the crime thriller re­volves around</p>
    <p>Annabelle Collins, whose six-yearold daugh­ter dies in a school shoot­ing. The killer is atyp­i­cally a fe­male – 16-year-old Raven Mon­roe.</p>
    <p>Collins pleads for the an­swer to “why did you do it?” un­til, fi­nally, the hor­rific mo­tive is re­vealed.</p>
    <p>Wee re­calls read­ing a lot of le­gal thrillers by Amer­i­can writer John Gr­isham dur­ing his teenage years. “I sup­pose that is my clos­est com­par­i­son to hav­ing a ‘crime thriller in­spi­ra­tion’,” he says.</p>
    <p>Asked what his chil­dren say about the novel, he adds: “My eight-year-old son, Ciaran, seemed some­what tick­led by the fact that I had a book with my name on it and he wanted to take it in for his class to read.”</p>
    <p>Wee had to tell him the book is not ex­actly child-friendly.</p>
    <p>“He asked if I had writ­ten the F-word in it and I sheep­ishly had to ad­mit, ‘Yes, it did ap­pear’. He was out­raged.”</p>
    <p>Why not write chil­dren’s books his sons could re­late to?</p>
    <p>“I have zero artistic abil­ity and I think or­gan­is­ing the graph­ics of a kids’ book is 80 per cent of the bat­tle,” says Wee, although he does not com­pletely rule out the idea.</p>
    <p>Till then, he is wait­ing for the day when Ciaran and his younger brother, Ruan, would read­ily pick up books over dig­i­tal de­vices.</p>
    <p>He says with mock ex­as­per­a­tion: “I have spent many, many mo­ments read­ing nov­els in front of them and do­ing cross­words. I read the news­pa­per ev­ery day. I read bedtime sto­ries with them ev­ery sin­gle night.</p>
    <p>“But not once in their en­tire life has ei­ther of my boys said, ‘You know what I want to do? I want to read a book.’</p>
    <p>“Every­thing comes back to their base DNA and, un­for­tu­nately, nei­ther of my boys seems to have reader DNA.”</p>
