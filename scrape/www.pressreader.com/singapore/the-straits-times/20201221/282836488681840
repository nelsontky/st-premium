    <p>Vet­eran Tai­wanese singer Donna Chiu has re­vealed a lit­tle-known de­tail about her one-time boss and men­tor – the long-re­tired iconic singer-ac­tor Steven Liu Wen-cheng.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan’s Ap­ple Daily re­cently in­ter­viewed Chiu, 55, for her up­com­ing Taipei con­cert next year, along­side con­cert guest per­former Malaysian singer Eric Moo.</p>
    <p>Chiu, who has largely cut back from her ac­tiv­i­ties in the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try since she mar­ried in 1996, said that Liu was so low­pro­file that he sent a hong­bao for her wed­ding to a post of­fice box.</p>
    <p>“I had to col­lect his hong­bao from the post of­fice,” she said.</p>
    <p>The 68-year-old Liu has stayed out of the spot­light since re­tir­ing as a singer at the height of his pop­u­lar­ity in 1984. In 1986, he founded the Feiy­ing (Fly­ing Ea­gle) record la­bel and formed a girl group Feiy­ing Trio, com­pris­ing Chiu and fel­low Tai­wanese singers An­nie Yi and Fang Wen-lin.</p>
    <p>He shut the la­bel in 1991 and moved to the United States, dis­ap­pear­ing en­tirely from pub­lic life – re­port­edly re­peat­edly re­ject­ing lu­cra­tive of­fers to per­form – and fu­elling a per­sonal mys­tique.</p>
    <p>Liu, who is known for hits such as his de­but song The Prom­ise (1975) and The Rain In March (1981), has been the sub­ject of sev­eral death hoaxes over the years.</p>
    <p>Chiu, who said she has not seen Liu in years, added: “I hope he’ll come and see me per­form, come check in on us ‘lit­tle ea­gles’. We’ve never for­got­ten him.”</p>
