    <p>OCBC Bank re­leased the re­sults of its an­nual Fi­nan­cial Well­ness In­dex re­cently. What was most strik­ing to me, but hon­estly un­sur­pris­ing, was the find­ing that mil­len­ni­als – aged 21 to 39 – were the most wor­ried about their fi­nances (Covid-19 hits Sin­ga­pore­ans’ fi­nan­cial well-be­ing: OCBC poll, Nov 24).</p>
    <p>As a mil­len­nial my­self, and about three years into the work­force, I can at­test that my per­sonal finance man­age­ment jour­ney has been one fraught with much con­fu­sion, but also ex­cite­ment.</p>
    <p>I en­tered the work­ing world know­ing next to noth­ing about per­sonal finance and how things like in­sur­ance or the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund worked, much less about how to grow my money by in­vest­ing.</p>
    <p>But I count my­self lucky to have par­ents who in­stilled in me from a young age ba­sic fi­nan­cial prin­ci­ples such as dif­fer­en­ti­at­ing my needs from my wants, and the im­por­tance of al­ways spend­ing within my means.</p>
    <p>Men­tors and peers have also gen­er­ously shared their knowl­edge and re­sources on the ba­sics of in­sur­ance and in­vest­ing.</p>
    <p>I would have had a much ear­lier head start had I learnt these lessons in school. Lessons on sav­ings, bud­get­ing and how to man­age debt will be per­ti­nent to younger gen­er­a­tions, es­pe­cially with the rapidly evolv­ing form of money – pur­chases can be made with the click of a but­ton or the tap of a card.</p>
    <p>This is crit­i­cal in the light of the find­ing from the same sur­vey that a sig­nif­i­cant pro­por­tion (48 per cent) of mil­len­ni­als spent to a large ex­tent “to keep up with their peers”.</p>
    <p>Mil­len­ni­als, un­for­tu­nately, also take the lead when it comes to of­ten pay­ing only the min­i­mum sum for their credit cards (38 per cent), as com­pared with Gen X</p>
    <p>(30 per cent) and baby boomers (22 per cent).</p>
    <p>Per­haps, if we were more ed­u­cated and in­formed about money mat­ters from a young age, we wouldn’t be so wor­ried. Sim­ple con­cepts of sav­ing and bud­get­ing could be in­tro­duced in pri­mary and sec­ondary schools, be­fore ad­vanc­ing to more com­plex top­ics like manag­ing debt, in­sur­ance and in­vest­ing at the ter­tiary level.</p>
    <p>Per­sonal finance could be in­te­grated with the char­ac­ter and ci­ti­zen­ship ed­u­ca­tion cur­ricu­lum, since be­ing fi­nan­cially sound and in­formed is un­doubt­edly an es­sen­tial part of be­com­ing a re­spon­si­ble and con­tribut­ing mem­ber of so­ci­ety.</p>
