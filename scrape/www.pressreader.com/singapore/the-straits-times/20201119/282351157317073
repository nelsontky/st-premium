    <p>Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics (SA) could plump for a new ap­proach to its re­lay coach­ing set-up as it looks to re­ha­bil­i­tate the Repub­lic’s stand­ing in an event it showed prom­ise in just a few years ago.</p>
    <p>All six na­tional re­lay teams – the men’s, women’s and mixed 4x100m and 4x400m sides – are cur­rently coach-less, with the SEA Games in Viet­nam slated to take place from Nov 21 to Dec 2 next year.</p>
    <p>Mixed re­lay coach Mar­garet Oh had re­signed dur­ing last year’s Games, while Hamkah Afik (men’s) and Melvin Tan (women’s) quit after the event. Tan cited “ex­ter­nal in­ter­fer­ence” while Hamkah said then that he felt he “could not progress in the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>SA vice-pres­i­dent (train­ing and se­lec­tion) Gary Yeo said that cre­at­ing a path­way for con­ti­nu­ity is one of the key con­sid­er­a­tions of the as­so­ci­a­tion’s cur­rent lead­er­ship, which was elected on Sept 25.</p>
    <p>The for­mer na­tional sprinter told The Straits Times: “We could go for hav­ing one main re­lay coach (for all the teams) with one or two ju­nior coaches sup­ple­ment­ing him or her.”</p>
    <p>SA pres­i­dent Lien Choong Luen added that he hopes his team can build on the “his­tor­i­cally very strong” per­for­mances in short-dis­tance races like sprints and re­lays.</p>
    <p>The men’s 4x100m re­lay team have de­liv­ered the most ath­let­ics medals for Sin­ga­pore in 30 edi­tions of the SEA Games, reach­ing the podium 19 times, although none of those have been gold.</p>
    <p>“What we want is a lit­tle bit of a more sys­tem­atic plan,” Lien said.</p>
    <p>He added that the as­so­ci­a­tion was tak­ing a care­ful ap­proach to de­cid­ing which coaches helm the re­lay teams.</p>
    <p>“We are mind­ful that re­lays tend to be among the most con­tentious events in ath­let­ics,” he said.</p>
    <p>“One is­sue is about se­lec­tion (of ath­letes), an­other is about who runs which leg, and a third is about which coach takes them.</p>
    <p>“Of course, it also de­pends on the ath­letes and their re­spec­tive per­for­mances too, and with the ath­letes still in qual­i­fi­ca­tion phase, it’s very hard to even gauge where they are (in terms of form).”</p>
    <p>Lien added that SA is still fig­ur­ing out cal­en­dar is­sues, with Covid-19 af­fect­ing travel over­seas and qual­i­fi­ca­tion op­por­tu­ni­ties for ath­letes.</p>
    <p>The men’s 4x100m re­lay team won medals at six of seven edi­tions of the SEA Games from 2003 to 2015, and a batch of sound run­ners, who in­cluded Yeo, rewrote the na­tional record six times from 2009 to 2015.</p>
    <p>How­ever, after most of them hung up their spikes fol­low­ing the 2015 Games at home, Sin­ga­pore have strug­gled in the event.</p>
    <p>In 2017, the team fin­ished sixth out of seven na­tions, and no men’s quar­tet earned the nod for last year’s edition.</p>
    <p>The women, how­ever, have shown re­cent prom­ise. Na­tional 100m and 200m sprint queen Shanti Pereira, 24, leads a group of up-and-com­ing run­ners who set a na­tional Un­der-20 record last year.</p>
    <p>Yeo, 34, who was a part of four straight sil­ver medal-win­ning SEA Games 4x100m re­lay teams from 2009 to 2015, noted that the chal­lenge of lift­ing stan­dards will be tricky for who­ever the in­com­ing coach is.</p>
    <p>“The re­lay coach will need to know how to man­age all the dif­fer­ent ath­letes who are un­der dif­fer­ent (in­di­vid­ual) coaches, and jug­gle the dif­fer­ent train­ing loads,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It’s al­most like foot­ball where a na­tional team is made up of play­ers from dif­fer­ent clubs, ex­cept in ath­let­ics it’s dif­fer­ent be­cause you don’t get two weeks to train to­gether, but some­times just one day a week.”</p>
    <p>NOT SIM­PLE AT ALL</p>
    <p>We are mind­ful that re­lays tend to be among the most con­tentious events in ath­let­ics.</p>
    <p>LIEN CHOONG LUEN, Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics pres­i­dent, on the is­sues in­volved when pick­ing re­lay coaches.</p>
