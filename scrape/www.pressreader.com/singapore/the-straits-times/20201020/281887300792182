    <p>•</p>
    <p>PARIS After four years in of­fice, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has failed to achieve his prom­ise to elim­i­nate the US trade deficit, and in­stead dealt a last­ing blow to the mul­ti­lat­eral eco­nomic sys­tem that global trade is based upon, an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>But even if Demo­crat Joe Bi­den wins the 2020 elec­tion as most opinion polls cur­rently show, US trade pol­icy is likely to main­tain a pro­tec­tion­ist streak and the con­fronta­tion with China is set to per­sist.</p>
    <p>One of Mr Trump’s main 2016 cam­paign themes was that the United States – the world’s big­gest econ­omy – had been taken ad­van­tage of by its trade part­ners and he pledged to shake up global trade ar­range­ments and elim­i­nate the na­tion’s trade deficit.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has in­deed shaken up the global trad­ing sys­tem but the US trade deficit has grown un­der his pres­i­dency, and an­a­lysts say he has lit­tle to show for his ef­forts.</p>
    <p>“Trump’s trade poli­cies have de­liv­ered few tan­gi­ble ben­e­fits to the US econ­omy while un­der­cut­ting the mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing sys­tem, dis­rupt­ing long­stand­ing al­liances with US trad­ing part­ners, and fo­ment­ing un­cer­tainty,” said Cor­nell Univer­sity pro­fes­sor Eswar Prasad.</p>
    <p>While the US trade deficit with China – Mr Trump’s main tar­get – has in­deed shrunk, im­ports from Canada and Mex­ico have jumped, deep­en­ing the over­all deficit.</p>
    <p>The im­port tar­iff in­creases that</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton has im­posed on many prod­ucts have “pro­tected Amer­i­can man­u­fac­tur­ers”, ac­cord­ing to Univer­sity of Paris-Dauphine eco­nomics pro­fes­sor Gian­luca Orefice .</p>
    <p>But those tar­iffs also “raised pro­duc­tion costs” for US in­dus­try and demon­strated the ex­tent of the re</p>
    <p>liance on Chi­nese sup­pli­ers.</p>
    <p>The global eco­nomic in­fra­struc­ture is now in a deep state of flux.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously his pol­icy has been deeply dam­ag­ing with re­spect to Europe, to the WTO, which will be hard to re­pair,” said Mr Ed­ward Alden, a jour­nal­ist and au­thor who spe­cialises in US trade pol­icy and who is cur­rently a fel­low at the Coun­cil on For­eign Re­la­tions think­tank.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s re­fusal to ap­point new judges has paral­ysed the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s (WTO) dis­pute res­o­lu­tion sys­tem, hob­bling the ar­bi­tra­tor of the world’s mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“Don­ald Trump has shown he is ca­pa­ble of break­ing, but in­ca­pable of build­ing,” said Dr Se­bastien Jean, direc­tor of CEPII, the main French in­sti­tute for re­search into in­ter­na­tional eco­nomics.</p>
    <p>“When one looks at what he got from China, one is tempted to say:</p>
    <p>All that for that?” he added.</p>
    <p>The truce in the US-China trade war reached in Jan­uary left un­solved ma­jor points of con­tention such as in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty theft and forced tech­nol­ogy trans­fers.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, “the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s er­ratic state­ments and pol­icy de­ci­sions have re­sulted in the US be­ing per­ceived as an un­re­li­able and un­trust­wor­thy trad­ing part­ner”, said Cor­nell’s Prof Prasad.</p>
    <p>This has led cer­tain coun­tries to go around the US and con­clude bi­lat­eral or mul­ti­lat­eral trade pacts, such as when Pa­cific na­tions went ahead with a deal after Mr Trump pulled his coun­try out of the Tran­sPa­cific Part­ner­ship.</p>
    <p>Mr Alden, how­ever, does credit Mr Trump with suc­cess­fully rene­go­ti­at­ing the North Amer­i­can Free Trade Agree­ment with Canada and Mex­ico, an ef­fort that was sup­ported by both Democrats and Repub­li­cans.</p>
    <p>Dr Jean also cred­its Mr Trump with chang­ing the dy­namic con­cern­ing China, which helped the Euro­pean Union change its pol­icy to­wards Bei­jing, in­clud­ing sev­eral Euro­pean coun­tries join­ing the US in ban­ning 5G mo­bile equip­ment from Chi­nese man­u­fac­turer Huawei.</p>
    <p>The po­si­tions of both Democrats and Repub­li­cans have hard­ened in re­cent years to­wards China, which is now viewed as a ri­val that needs to be con­tained as it has not evolved into a lib­eral mar­ket econ­omy as had been hoped.</p>
    <p>“Un­der ei­ther can­di­date, the trade war is likely to spread,” said Ms Vicky Red­wood at Cap­i­tal Eco­nomics.</p>
    <p>“The trade war was ba­si­cally in­evitable given China’s eco­nomic rise and per­sis­tence with high lev­els of state in­ter­ven­tion rather than adop­tion of mar­ket forces,” she said.</p>
