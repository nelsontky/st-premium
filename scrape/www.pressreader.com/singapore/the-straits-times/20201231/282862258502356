    <p>Like ev­ery­body else, book pub­lish­ers will be happy to see the end of this year.</p>
    <p>But, for many of them, the year has brought some pos­i­tive news, which has been as wel­come as it was sur­pris­ing: Busi­ness has been good.</p>
    <p>With many stuck at home and ac­tiv­i­ties from con­certs to movies off-lim­its, peo­ple have been read­ing a lot – or at least buy­ing a lot of books.</p>
    <p>Print sales by units are up by al­most 8 per cent so far this year, ac­cord­ing to NPD BookScan.</p>
    <p>Sales of e-books and au­dio­books, which make up a smaller por­tion of the mar­ket, are up as well.</p>
    <p>“I ex­pect that at the end of the year, when you look at the fi­nal num­bers, it will have been the best year in a very long time,” Ms Made­line McIn­tosh, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Pen­guin Ran­dom House US, said of the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>When the United States slammed shut in March, book sales dropped sharply – but the dip did not last.</p>
    <p>While parts of the in­dus­try have con­tin­ued to strug­gle, such as book­stores and ed­u­ca­tional pub­lish­ers, pub­lish­ing ex­ec­u­tives say de­mand came rush­ing back around June.</p>
    <p>Many of these sales went to Ama­zon, but big-box stores, es­pe­cially Tar­get, also did well. As es­sen­tial busi­nesses that sold items such as gro­ceries, they were al­lowed to stay open through the lock­downs.</p>
    <p>Mr Den­nis Ab­boud, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Read­erLink, a book dis­trib­u­tor to ma­jor chains such as Wal­mart, Tar­get and Costco, said his com­pany’s on­line sales nearly quadru­pled over last year.</p>
    <p>“It was re­ally a tale of two cities,” he said. “The be­gin­ning of the year was mega-soft and the end of the year was mega-strong.”</p>
    <p>Even though the num­ber of peo­ple com­mut­ing has plum­meted this year, au­dio­book rev­enue is up by more than 17 per cent over the same pe­riod last year, ac­cord­ing to the As­so­ci­a­tion of Amer­i­can Pub­lish­ers. E-book sales, which had been de­clin­ing for the past sev­eral years, are also up by more than 16 per cent.</p>
    <p>There have been a few par­tic­u­larly pow­er­ful themes in book­selling this year.</p>
    <p>The Black Lives Mat­ter protests, fol­low­ing the death of Mr Ge­orge Floyd at the end of May, caused a rush on books about race and an­tiracism.</p>
    <p>Book­stores had trou­ble keep­ing ti­tles like How To Be An An­tiracist by Ibram X. Kendi and So You Want To Talk About Race by Ijeoma Oluo in stock.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal books, es­pe­cially about US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, have also per­formed well. That was a par­tic­u­lar boon for Si­mon & Schus­ter, which pub­lished some of the big­gest pres­i­den­tial tell-alls of the year, in­clud­ing Ms Mary Trump’s Too Much And Never Enough, which sold more than 1.35 mil­lion copies in its first week.</p>
    <p>For­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama’s mem­oir, A Promised</p>
    <p>Land – pub­lished by Crown, an im­print of Pen­guin Ran­dom House – has sold more than 3.3 mil­lion copies in North Amer­ica since it was pub­lished last month.</p>
    <p>New books – which, in in­dus­trys­peak, are called the frontlist – have sold well, but so have older ti­tles.</p>
    <p>“There have been frontlist suc­cesses like A Promised Land or Un­tamed, ab­so­lutely,” Ms McIn­tosh said of Mr Obama’s book and a mem­oir by Glen­non Doyle.</p>
    <p>“But things like The Very Hun­gry Cater­pil­lar have sold more copies than we have in the past. It’s just this re­mark­able lift of the whole mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>Parts of the book world have strug­gled. With many churches and other houses of wor­ship closed, the sale of re­li­gious books has dropped, ac­cord­ing to NPD BookScan, and the travel cat­e­gory has tanked by more than 40 per cent in print.</p>
    <p>In­de­pen­dent book­stores have also had an ex­traor­di­nar­ily dif­fi­cult year.</p>
    <p>Many were closed to foot traf­fic for months and scram­bled to turn their stores into ful­fil­ment cen­tres for on­line or­ders – some­thing they were never built to do on a sig­nif­i­cant scale.</p>
    <p>Some stores re­ported to the Amer­i­can Book­sellers As­so­ci­a­tion ear­lier this year that their sales were down by at least 40 per cent.</p>
    <p>But Ms Al­li­son Hill, the trade or­gan­i­sa­tion’s chief ex­ec­u­tive, said the last few weeks have been en­cour­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>“The stakes were very high go­ing into the hol­i­day sea­son,” she said. “We won’t re­ally know where ev­ery­body stands un­til the hol­i­day sea­son is com­pletely fin­ished.”</p>

Big-box stores in the US have fared well in the pan&#xAD;demic and con&#xAD;trib&#xAD;uted to the rise in print book sales.</p>
