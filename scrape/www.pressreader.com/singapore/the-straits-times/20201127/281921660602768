    <p>Freed Aus­tralian-Bri­tish aca­demic Kylie Moore-Gil­bert said yes­ter­day that her re­lease from jail in Iran ended a “long and trau­matic or­deal”, thank­ing those who cam­paigned for her free­dom.</p>
    <p>Dr Moore-Gil­bert said the sup­port she re­ceived while de­tained “had meant the world to me” and praised the govern­ment for “work­ing tire­lessly” on her be­half, ac­cord­ing to a state­ment re­leased by Aus­tralia’s For­eign Min­istry.</p>
    <p>The aca­demic, who is in her early 30s, also said she had “noth­ing but re­spect, love and ad­mi­ra­tion” for Iran and its peo­ple – de­spite spend­ing two years and three months in pri­son on spy­ing charges that she has stren­u­ously de­nied.</p>
    <p>“It is with bit­ter­sweet feel­ings that I de­part your coun­try, de­spite the in­jus­tices which I have been sub­jected to,” she said. “I came to Iran as a friend and with friendly in­ten­tions, and de­part Iran with those sen­ti­ments not only still in­tact, but strength­ened.”</p>
    <p>She said she now faces a “chal­leng­ing pe­riod of ad­just­ment”.</p>
    <p>Dr Moore-Gil­bert, a lec­turer in Is­lamic stud­ies at the Univer­sity of Mel­bourne, had been serv­ing a 10-year sen­tence for spy­ing.</p>
    <p>Iran con­firmed her ar­rest in Septem­ber last year but it had long been be­lieved that she was de­tained a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>The Is­lamic Repub­lic said on Wed­nes­day that she had been re­leased in a pris­oner ex­change but there was no im­me­di­ate con­fir­ma­tion of the iden­tity of the three Ira­ni­ans re­port­edly in­volved.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son yes­ter­day said he had spo­ken with Dr Moore-Gil­bert ahead of her re­turn.</p>
    <p>“I have al­ways be­lieved in mir­a­cles and I’m just thank­ful for this one,” Mr Mor­ri­son told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“She seems to be, in our own con­ver­sa­tions, in quite good spir­its, but I imag­ine there is a lot of pro­cess­ing to go through yet.”</p>
    <p>Once Dr Moore-Gil­bert ar­rives in Aus­tralia, she will go into quar­an­tine at an un­spec­i­fied location for two weeks.</p>
