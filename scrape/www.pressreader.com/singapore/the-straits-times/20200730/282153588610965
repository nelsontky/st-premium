    <p>Mil­i­tary Ex­pert 4 Ap­pren­tice Chin Kang Jie’s in­ter­est in en­gi­neer­ing be­gan when he watched his fa­ther re­pair and race ra­dio-con­trolled cars as a child.</p>
    <p>Later, in his teenage years, tin­ker­ing with his moun­tain bike be­came his new hobby as this was more eco­nom­i­cal than send­ing the bi­cy­cle to a shop for re­pair work.</p>
    <p>When he did not make the grades to do ad­di­tional math­e­mat­ics – widely re­garded a pre­req­ui­site for en­gi­neer­ing cour­ses – in Sec­ondary 2, he trans­ferred to an­other school that would let him do the sub­ject.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic aero­nau­ti­cal en­gi­neer­ing grad­u­ate was awarded the SAF En­gi­neer­ing Schol­ar­ship af­ter sign­ing on with the Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Air Force (RSAF).</p>
    <p>“I have the love for en­gi­neer­ing as well as the love for the mil­i­tary, and I found that align­ment with RSAF... given this op­por­tu­nity in an or­gan­i­sa­tion this big which grows its peo­ple was re­ally ap­peal­ing to me,” said ME4(A) Chin, 22.</p>
    <p>He is one of a record 95 schol­ar­ship re­cip­i­ents at this year’s De­fence Schol­ar­ship Awards Cer­e­mony, where seven types of schol­ar­ships were awarded. These in­clude the SAF Schol­ar­ship, the SAF En­gi­neer­ing and Medicine schol­ar­ships, and the De­fence Sci­ence and Tech­nol­ogy Agency (DSTA) Schol­ar­ship.</p>
    <p>The schol­ar­ship re­cip­i­ents, picked for their aca­demic ex­cel­lence and stand­out lead­er­ship qual­i­ties, will pur­sue their un­der­grad­u­ate stud­ies lo­cally or overseas. The cer­e­mony was held re­motely in­stead of at its tra­di­tional Is­tana venue due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“It’s cer­tainly not as grand as the Is­tana, but the sig­nif­i­cance of this award is in no way di­min­ished,” said De­fence Min­is­ter Ng Eng Hen in his speech.</p>
    <p>He added: “The qual­ity of re­cip­i­ents has been main­tained, if not en­hanced, as the num­ber of ap­pli­ca­tions also hit an­other record, close to 2,000 ap­pli­cants in all.” He dis­pelled as­sump­tions that the in­crease was a re­sult of the eco­nomic down­turn since ap­pli­ca­tions were re­ceived last Au­gust, prior to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Dr Ng also high­lighted how the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces (SAF) per­son­nel con­trib­uted to the na­tion’s ef­forts to han­dle the pan­demic by build­ing beds.</p>
    <p>DSTA also helped build new mo­bile swab sta­tions, self-check tem­per­a­ture kiosks and an­a­lyt­ics soft­ware for bet­ter con­tact trac­ing, among other con­tri­bu­tions.</p>
    <p>The mil­i­tary’s in­volve­ment in set­ting up com­mu­nity care fa­cil­i­ties amid the pan­demic im­pressed Of­fi­cer Cadet Rajesh Muthu Ra­manathan.</p>
    <p>The 19-year-old is one of seven SAF Medicine Schol­ar­ship re­cip­i­ents.</p>
    <p>“I felt that this is some­thing that I want to do in the fu­ture – to be there for the na­tion when you’re most needed as a front-line worker,” he said.</p>
    <p>“That’s the rea­son why I took up medicine in the first place, and be­ing in the SAF, I felt, (would pro­vide) an­other set of chal­lenges and also a greater mean­ing for me.”</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cer Cadet Tang Tai Ran, one of the two women among the seven re­cip­i­ents of the pres­ti­gious SAF Schol­ar­ship, hopes be a role model for other girls.</p>
    <p>The 19-year-old re­called a schol­ar­ship talk she at­tended in which the panel of schol­ar­ship re­cip­i­ents were all men.</p>
    <p>“When I looked at the en­tire ta­ble, I re­alised that there weren’t any fe­male rep­re­sen­ta­tives. In that mo­ment, I thought to my­self: I want to be some­one that girls in the au­di­ence can look up to.”</p>
