    <p>Six new coro­n­avirus cases were con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,291.</p>
    <p>All six cases were im­ported and had been placed on stay-home no­tice on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>The new cases com­prise a Sin­ga­porean, two per­ma­nent res­i­dents and three work per­mit hold­ers who are cur­rently em­ployed here.</p>
    <p>One of the work per­mit hold­ers, a 37-year-old who ar­rived from In­done­sia, ex­pe­ri­enced the on­set of symp­toms on Nov 25 and was con­firmed pos­i­tive on Tues­day. She was a con­tact of a pre­vi­ous case.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing five cases were asymp­to­matic and were de­tected through proac­tive screen­ing and sur­veil­lance, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean is a 64-yearold man who re­turned from In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>The two per­ma­nent res­i­dents are a 39-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl who re­turned from In­dia. The girl is linked to a pre­vi­ous case.</p>
    <p>The other two work per­mit hold­ers had ar­rived from In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>All six new cases were tested while serv­ing their stay-home no­tice at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>There were no new cases from work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries and none in the com­mu­nity, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>MOH also gave an up­date on the 83-year-old man who had tested pos­i­tive while aboard the Royal Caribbean’s Quan­tum of the Seas cruise ship. Sub­se­quent tests of his sam­ples were neg­a­tive for Covid-19, said MOH last night.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier yes­ter­day, MOH an­nounced that the man had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 in the morn­ing and was im­me­di­ately iso­lated.</p>
    <p>He had re­ported to the ship’s med­i­cal cen­tre with di­ar­rhoea and was tested for the in­fec­tion us­ing poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) test equip­ment on board the ship.</p>
    <p>His orig­i­nal PCR sam­ple was later retested at the Na­tional Pub­lic Health Lab­o­ra­tory (NPHL) and came back neg­a­tive for Covid-19 in­fec­tion, MOH said. A sec­ond fresh sam­ple was tested and also found to be neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>NPHL will con­duct an­other test to­day to con­firm his Covid-19 sta­tus, added MOH.</p>
    <p>All the iden­ti­fied close con­tacts of the man have been iso­lated as a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure, and all pas­sen­gers un­der­went manda­tory Covid-19 test­ing be­fore they were al­lowed to leave the ter­mi­nal at Ma­rina Bay Cruise Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>As a pre­cau­tion, pas­sen­gers are also re­quired to mon­i­tor their health for 14 days from the date of dis­em­barka­tion and un­dergo a swab test at the end of the mon­i­tor­ing pe­riod, MOH said.</p>
    <p>MOH said the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with a to­tal of one case in the past week that is linked to a pre­vi­ous case.</p>
    <p>With six cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,167 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 20 pa­tients are in hospi­tal, while 60 pa­tients are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 29 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
