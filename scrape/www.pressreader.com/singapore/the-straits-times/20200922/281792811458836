    <p>PETALING JAYA • Malaysia had the high­est Covid-19 re­pro­duc­tion num­ber (Rt) of 1.57 on Sept 15, among six other coun­tries in the re­gion, ac­cord­ing to a dis­ease mod­el­ling cen­tre based in Britain.</p>
    <p>The Cen­tre for Math­e­mat­i­cal Mod­el­ling of In­fec­tious Dis­eases on its “Epi­fore­casts” web­site es­ti­mated that Malaysia’s Covid-19 re­pro­duc­tion num­ber on Sept 15 was at 1.57, fol­lowed by Sin­ga­pore at 1.15, Thai­land at 1.1, In­done­sia at 1.06 and the Philip­pines at 1.0.</p>
    <p>The Rt is the rate of in­fec­tiv­ity and es­ti­mates the av­er­age num­ber of peo­ple that one pos­i­tive Covid-19 pa­tient can in­fect.</p>
    <p>An Rt value of less than 1.0 is a good sign. While R0, or R-naught, is the ini­tial re­pro­duc­tion num­ber of the coro­n­avirus at the be­gin­ning of the pan­demic, Rt refers to the re­pro­duc­tion num­ber at a par­tic­u­lar point in time.</p>
    <p>On Sept 15, a re­cent date when data from many coun­tries has been of­fi­cially pub­lished, two re­gional coun­tries with a Covid-19 re­pro­duc­tion rate of be­low 1.0 were Viet­nam at 0.61 and Cam­bo­dia at 0.49.</p>
    <p>How­ever, data for Myan­mar, Brunei and Laos was not avail­able.</p>
    <p>“Our mod­el­ling frame­work, based on open source tool­ing, ac­counts for un­cer­tain re­port­ing de­lays so that the re­pro­duc­tion num­ber is es­ti­mated based on un­der­ly­ing la­tent in­fec­tions and not re­ported cases or deaths,” ac­cord­ing to the cen­tre’s web­site.</p>
    <p>The mod­el­ling cen­tre, which is lo­cated at the London School of Hy­giene and Trop­i­cal Medicine, claims to be a mul­ti­dis­ci­plinary group­ing of epi­demi­ol­o­gists, math­e­mati­cians, econ­o­mists, statis­ti­cians and clin­i­cians.</p>
    <p>While the cen­tre’s es­ti­ma­tion at 1.57 on Sept 15 for Malaysia was close to the Health Min­istry’s fig­ure of 1.58 on Sept 13, it did not ex­plain why this was higher than the in­fec­tiv­ity rates in In­done­sia, Sin­ga­pore and the Philip­pines which have a far higher num­ber of cases.</p>
    <p>Other coun­tries badly hit by the pan­demic, such as Britain – which has a to­tal of 390,358 cases – also had a slightly lower read­ing than Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s Rt peaked at 2.34 on Sept 8 and at 2.30 on Sept 11.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s di­rec­tor-gen­eral of health, Dr Noor Hisham Ab­dul­lah, had pre­vi­ously cau­tioned that it was cru­cial to keep the Rt to be­low 1.60 to avoid a new wave of</p>
    <p>Covid-19 in­fec­tions in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Last week, he noted the need to strike a bal­ance be­tween pro­tect­ing lives and liveli­hoods. “We should not re­peat an­other lock­down as seen in other coun­tries. Our Rt is alarm­ing,” he tweeted.</p>
    <p>On Sept 18, the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment stated on its of­fi­cial web­site that the Rt in the coun­try was es­ti­mated to be be­tween 1.1 and 1.4, with the num­ber of new in­fec­tions grow­ing by 2 per cent to 7 per cent ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>“An R num­ber of be­tween 1.1 and 1.4 means that on an av­er­age, ev­ery 10 peo­ple in­fected will in­fect be­tween 11 and 14 other peo­ple,” it said, point­ing out that there was wide­spread growth of the epi­demic across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The virus will spread faster in densely pop­u­lated cities with pub­lic trans­porta­tion as a main method of com­mut­ing.</p>
    <p>Asked why the coun­try had recorded a higher Rt com­pared to other coun­tries that recorded much higher cases in the re­gion, Dr Raj Ku­mar, pres­i­dent of the Med­i­cal Prac­ti­tion­ers Coali­tion As­so­ci­a­tion of Malaysia, said the num­ber was not fixed.</p>
    <p>“In­stead, it changes as our be­hav­iour changes or as im­mu­nity de­vel­ops. Rt does not de­pend on the num­ber of cases in the coun­try but how many other peo­ple can get in­fected from one in­fected case,” he said.</p>
