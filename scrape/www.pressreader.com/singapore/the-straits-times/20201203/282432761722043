    <p>Zine­dine Zi­dane rub­bished sug­ges­tions he could walk away from Real Madrid and said the Span­ish cham­pi­ons did not de­serve to lose 2-0 to Shakhtar Donetsk on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>It was their sec­ond de­feat by the Ukraini­ans this sea­son, di­min­ish­ing their hopes of reach­ing the Cham­pi­ons League last 16.</p>
    <p>Sub­sti­tutes Dentinho and Manor Solomon scored sec­ond-half goals in Kiev as Shakhtar stunned the 13-time Euro­pean cham­pi­ons again, hav­ing won 3-2 in Madrid in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Shakhtar had lost their last two Group B matches against Borus­sia Monchengla­d­bach by an ag­gre­gate score of 10-0, but this vic­tory al­lowed them to move above Real into sec­ond place with one game re­main­ing.</p>
    <p>Glad­bach lead Shakhtar (seven points) by a point and have the up­per hand on Real (also seven) thanks to their su­pe­rior head-to­head record.</p>
    <p>How­ever, In­ter Milan’s 3-2 win in Ger­many not only kept the Ital­ians’ (five) hopes alive, but also lim­ited the dam­age for Real, who now know a home win over the Ger­mans next week will take them through, re­gard­less of how Shakhtar fare in their last game.</p>
    <p>Real have made it out of their group ev­ery year since 1997. Fail­ure to progress would be seen as a dis­as­ter, but Zi­dane said he would not leave the club he has led to three Cham­pi­ons League and two La Liga ti­tles in two spells as coach.</p>
    <p>“I am not go­ing to re­sign, not at all,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We are al­ways go­ing to have dif­fi­cult mo­ments, and we are on a bad run, but we need to keep go­ing.”</p>
    <p>The French­man, whose team also lost at the week­end, go­ing down 2-1 at home to Alaves in La Liga, added: “I have the strength needed to turn the sit­u­a­tion around and I am go­ing to give ev­ery­thing to do that, so are the play­ers.</p>
    <p>“We played well and we de­served more. We just need to lift our heads up and think about the next game.”</p>
    <p>GIV­ING THEIR ALL</p>
    <p>Real were re­turn­ing to the scene of their vic­tory over Liver­pool in the 2018 fi­nal, but they looked a shadow of their for­mer selves in the cold of Kiev’s Olympic Sta­dium, and the re­sult un­der­lined the loss of tal­is­man Ser­gio Ramos.</p>
    <p>This was Real’s sev­enth de­feat in the last nine Cham­pi­ons League matches they have played with­out their in­jured skip­per.</p>
    <p>The game may have turned out dif­fer­ently had Marco Asen­sio scored in the fifth minute rather than turn Karim Ben­zema’s cross onto the post.</p>
    <p>But in­stead they slumped to a third loss in five matches.</p>
    <p>Real mid­fielder Luka Mo­dric said the play­ers were feel­ing low but backed his team to progress.</p>
    <p>“It’s dif­fi­cult to ex­plain what is hap­pen­ing to us right now, we are in a very dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tion, but we still have one game left and we’re go­ing to do ev­ery­thing to win it,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Real Madrid have al­ways shown who we are when we need to win but we need to do our talk­ing on the pitch now.”</p>
    <p>We are on a bad run, but we need to keep go­ing. I have the strength needed to turn the sit­u­a­tion around and I am go­ing to give ev­ery­thing to do that, so are the play­ers.</p>
