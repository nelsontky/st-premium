    <p>Gen­eral travel to Brunei and New Zealand will be al­lowed from Sept 1, but trav­ellers should not sim­ply hop on a plane to these des­ti­na­tions, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Please check what are the re­quire­ments of the des­ti­na­tion coun­tries and make sure you com­ply with the re­quire­ments be­fore you fly over,” Mr Gan said dur­ing a vir­tual press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers should also ex­er­cise vig­i­lance, and con­tinue to ob­serve the safe dis­tanc­ing rules in those coun­tries to pro­tect them­selves and oth­ers, he added.</p>
    <p>With gen­eral travel now al­lowed to these two coun­tries, trav­ellers will be el­i­gi­ble for govern­ment sub­si­dies and in­sur­ance cov­er­age for treat­ment in Sin­ga­pore if they end up be­ing in­fected with Covid-19, said Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The task force, which Mr Gan also co-chairs, also an­nounced yes­ter­day that bor­der re­stric­tions will be eased for visi­tors from both these na­tions com­ing to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers who have re­mained in Brunei or New Zealand for the past con­sec­u­tive 14 days prior to their visit to Sin­ga­pore will not have to serve a stay-home no­tice when they ar­rive here.</p>
    <p>In­stead, they will un­dergo a Covid-19 test upon ar­rival at the air­port, and will be al­lowed to go about their ac­tiv­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore only af­ter re­ceiv­ing a neg­a­tive test re­sult, the task force said.</p>
    <p>They will also need to ap­ply for an Air Travel Pass – ap­pli­ca­tions for which will start on Sept 1 – be­tween seven and 30 days be­fore their in­tended date of ar­rival here.</p>
    <p>They will also be re­spon­si­ble for their med­i­cal bills should they re­quire med­i­cal treat­ment for Covid-19 while in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, stu­dents study­ing over­seas at in­sti­tu­tions which do not of­fer dis­tance learn­ing as an op­tion will also be al­lowed to travel from Sept 1.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said: “Many for­eign ed­u­ca­tion in­sti­tu­tions are re­sum­ing their terms quite soon, and we know that there are stu­dents based in Sin­ga­pore who are full­time stu­dents and who have to go back to school in these var­i­ous in­sti­tu­tions.”</p>
    <p>These stu­dents will be el­i­gi­ble for govern­ment sub­si­dies and in­sur­ance cov­er­age if they test pos­i­tive for Covid-19 and get treated in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong noted that other than Brunei and New Zealand, there are other low-risk coun­tries and re­gions, and that visi­tors from these ar­eas may not need to serve a stay-home no­tice.</p>
    <p>“But out of abun­dance of cau­tion, we will keep the re­quire­ment for now,” he said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the stay-home no­tice pe­riod for trav­ellers from low-risk places such as Aus­tralia (ex­clud­ing Vic­to­ria state), Ma­cau, main­land China, Tai­wan, Viet­nam and Malaysia will be short­ened from the cur­rent 14 days to seven days, which can be served at their place of res­i­dence or ho­tels in­stead of ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties from Sept 1.</p>
    <p>Visi­tors will be tested for Covid-19 be­fore the end of their stay-home no­tice.</p>
    <p>With yes­ter­day’s an­nounce­ments, there will now be three cat­e­gories of trav­ellers in Sin­ga­pore, said Mr Wong: Trav­ellers who do not have to serve a stay­home no­tice; trav­ellers who can serve a shorter stay-home no­tice at their own place of res­i­dence; and fi­nally, visi­tors who must serve the usual 14-day pe­riod at a ded­i­cated fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>“The coun­tries in the dif­fer­ent cat­e­gories will con­tinue to be up­dated over time... We con­tinue to as­sess the sit­u­a­tion, and we will up­date the list over time,” he said.</p>
