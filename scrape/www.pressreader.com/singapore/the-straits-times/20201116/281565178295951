    <p>Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore swung to a net profit of $54.4 mil­lion for the three months to Sept 30 from a net loss of $163.3 mil­lion in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter, after Re­sorts World Sen­tosa re­opened to vis­i­tors in July. But on a year-on-year ba­sis, the con­tin­ued ab­sence of in­bound tourists was keenly felt as earn­ings were down 66 per cent.</p>
    <p>Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore swung to a net profit of $54.4 mil­lion for the three months to Sept 30 from a net loss of $163.3 mil­lion in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter, after Re­sorts World Sen­tosa (RWS) re­opened to vis­i­tors in early July as the na­tion en­tered phase two of its grad­ual re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>On a year-on-year ba­sis though, the con­tin­ued ab­sence of in­bound tourists due to Covid-19 travel re­stric­tions was keenly felt as earn­ings were down 66 per cent from $158.9 mil­lion in the third quar­ter of last year, with the group con­tin­u­ing to ex­pe­ri­ence “weak de­mand”.</p>
    <p>Group rev­enue halved to $300.1 mil­lion from a year ago, said the firm in its third-quar­ter business update last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal gam­blers re­turn­ing to the casino at RWS re­sulted in gam­ing rev­enue of $212.9 mil­lion for the third quar­ter, com­pared with $6.5 mil­lion in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter when cir­cuit breaker mea­sures were in force. Still, this rev­enue was 41 per cent lower than the $360.8 mil­lion in the year­ago pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With vis­i­tors re­turn­ing slowly to Univer­sal Stu­dios Sin­ga­pore and SEA Aquar­ium from July 1, non-gam­ing rev­enue rose to $59.9 mil­lion, from $16.3 mil­lion in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter. Year on year, this rev­enue fell 74 per cent from $234.6 mil­lion pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>RWS laid off about 2,000 em­ploy­ees in July, The Straits Times re­ported, most of whom were for­eign­ers. The com­pany did not give the num­ber re­trenched.</p>
    <p>Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore had about 9,400 em­ploy­ees last year, when just over seven in 10 were ei­ther Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens or per­ma­nent res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>In its business update, the com­pany said that with travel re­stric­tions still in place and the fes­tive sea­son round the cor­ner, RWS has rolled out spe­cially cu­rated stay­ca­tion pack­ages at its ho­tels for lo­cals, as well as theme-based din­ing ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore re­it­er­ated its com­mit­ment to de­velop the $4.5 bil­lion mega ex­pan­sion for RWS an­nounced last year.</p>
    <p>It also said it is “keenly ex­plor­ing” the Yoko­hama in­te­grated re­sort op­por­tu­nity in Ja­pan, as part of its ge­o­graph­i­cal di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion strat­egy. But it added: “We will eval­u­ate the con­di­tions of the re­quest-for-pro­posal and the in­vest­ment en­vi­ron­ment when the for­mal bid­ding process be­gins and will re­spond with a pro­posal, if these con­di­tions meet the group’s in­vest­ment cri­te­ria.”</p>
    <p>Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore shares closed un­changed last Friday at 74.5 cents, up 46 per cent from its year-low of 51 cents in March.</p>
