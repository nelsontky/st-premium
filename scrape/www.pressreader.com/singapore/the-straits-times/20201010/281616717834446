    <p>WASHINGTON • Court doc­u­ments re­vealed that Sin­ga­porean spy for China Dickson Yeo agreed to be in­ter­viewed by Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion (FBI) agents, choos­ing not to board a plane that could have got­ten him out of the US scot-free.</p>
    <p>District Judge Tanya Chutkan said Yeo’s ac­tions showed a de­sire to come clean, which she fac­tored into his sen­tence of 14 months.</p>
    <p>“You did not take the av­enue of es­cape you may have been af­forded. You changed your mind and de­cided to speak with the agent, and shortly af­ter, with­out the ben­e­fit of coun­sel, you con­fessed,” she said at Yeo’s sen­tenc­ing hear­ing at a fed­eral court yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Ever since that time, you have done ev­ery­thing to try and make good and make up for your ac­tions,” she added. “It is one thing to do some­thing wrong, but it is an­other thing to make right.”</p>
    <p>Prose­cu­tors said that Yeo had been ini­tially in­ter­viewed by bor­der agents when he entered the coun­try via the John F. Kennedy In­ter­na­tional Air­port in New York last Nov 6. He did not re­veal then that he was work­ing for Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence ser­vices.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he did tell the of­fi­cers that he had met civil ser­vants and diplo­mats to write papers about how China treats smaller strate­gic states such as Sin­ga­pore and South Korea, adding that some of his work could be con­sid­ered “bor­der­line cor­po­rate es­pi­onage”.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the in­ter­view, Yeo deleted the WeChat app he had used to com­mu­ni­cate with his Chi­nese han­dlers from his mo­bile phone and booked a flight out of the United States the next day.</p>
    <p>On Nov 7, he re­turned to the air­port, where he was ap­proached by FBI agents, who asked him for a vol­un­tary in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>Al­though he ini­tially de­clined to be in­ter­viewed and went to board his flight, Yeo changed his mind, re­turned to the FBI agents and agreed to be in­ter­viewed, ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>Yeo was forth­com­ing about his ac­tiv­i­ties and ad­mit­ted that he was work­ing for Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence. He agreed to con­tinue meet­ing the FBI af­ter that in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>He was ar­rested and taken into cus­tody the next day, on Nov 8.</p>
    <p>Ar­gu­ing for a lighter sen­tence, Yeo’s lawyer Michelle Peter­son pointed out that he agreed to sub­ject him­self to the US le­gal sys­tem, even though he was com­pletely free to board a plane and leave the coun­try with­out reper­cus­sion.</p>
    <p>“When he was ap­proached at the air­port, he was free to leave. Nev­er­the­less, he agreed in­stead to be de­briefed by the agents. He de­planed when he did not have to do so, and fully de­briefed,” she said in court doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>This, she said, was an “ex­cep­tional level of ac­cep­tance of re­spon­si­bil­ity and gen­uine show­ing of re­morse”.</p>
