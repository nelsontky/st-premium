    <p>Due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, OCBC Cy­cle has been gear­ing up with home-based virtual work­outs for the first time to help cy­clists be phys­i­cally ready for the Nov 1-15 free virtual event.</p>
    <p>In con­junc­tion with hy­dra­tion part­ners 100Plus, OCBC Cy­cle has been en­gag­ing barre and spin in­struc­tor Tiong Jia En for eight home-based virtual work­out ses­sions.</p>
    <p>A 100Plus spokesman said: “The eight-week virtual work­out se­ries by 100Plus were spe­cially de­signed to train par­tic­i­pants for a stronger, smoother ride with OCBC Cy­cle.</p>
    <p>“They in­clude a com­bi­na­tion of abs, legs and power to level up your spin game – all done safely and com­fort­ably at home.”</p>
    <p>The fi­nal two one-hour ses­sions – hosted on the 100Plus Face­book page – will be held to­mor­row and Oct 25 from 11am to 12pm.</p>
    <p>The penul­ti­mate ses­sion will fo­cus on stretches. The last one will be a cul­mi­na­tion of the pre­vi­ous ses­sions: abs, legs and power work­outs, be­fore end­ing off with some stretch­ing.</p>
    <p>Lim Zhuo En, a 37-year-old mar­ket­ing ex­ec­u­tive, en­joyed all of the four ses­sions she has joined.</p>
    <p>She said: “They can be quite chal­leng­ing. The good thing about a virtual home work­out is you can choose to take it easy if you need to.</p>
    <p>“I man­aged to power through with Jia En’s en­cour­age­ment and I was to­tally ex­hausted af­ter each work­out... Her classes are re­ally fun, en­gag­ing and chal­leng­ing.</p>
    <p>“The sore mus­cles the fol­low­ing day af­ter each work­out is a re­minder that I’m get­ting stronger!”</p>
    <p>Lim con­sid­ers her­self a fairly ac­tive and fit in­di­vid­ual, but ad­mit­ted that cy­cling is not some­thing she does on a reg­u­lar ba­sis.</p>
    <p>As such, the virtual work­outs were help­ful in her prepa­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>“Know­ing there is a spe­cialised train­ing pro­gramme to pre­pare us is a great con­fi­dence booster that I should be able to con­quer my 42km Sportive Ride,” she added.</p>
    <p>All 4,700 slots across three cat­e­gories – the Sportive VR (42km), The Straits Times Ride VR (23km), and The Mighty Savers Kids VR (5km and 800m) – were snapped up in Septem­ber, a month be­fore or­gan­is­ers planned to close reg­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>AT YOUR OWN PACE</p>
    <p>The good thing about a virtual home work­out is you can choose to take it easy if you need to.</p>
    <p>LIM ZHUO EN, mar­ket­ing ex­ec­u­tive.</p>
