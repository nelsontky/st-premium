    <p>The de­fence came to court armed with two huge slabs sim­i­lar to floor tiles to show how the floor tiles at site with wet tis­sue pa­pers were not in­con­spic­u­ous, mak­ing a man’s ac­ci­dent his own fault.</p>
    <p>But the court stand-off was averted when the de­fen­dant, a ser­vices con­trac­tor, ac­cepted 60 per cent li­a­bil­ity for the plain­tiff’s in­jury, with dam­ages to be as­sessed.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng Tee Kian, 60, frac­tured his an­kle when he slipped and fell out­side a re­tail unit at Fu­sio­nop­o­lis One on June 18, 2016. He later suf­fered from a sleep dis­or­der in­volv­ing an in­vol­un­tary limb move­ment dis­or­der.</p>
    <p>He had been on his way to the toi­let at about 9pm that night when he slipped on the floor, which was wet be­cause of vomit, ac­cord­ing to court pa­pers filed.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sented by Clif­ford Law part­ner Viviene Sandhu, he sued C&W Ser­vices, the fa­cil­i­ties man­ager for the build­ing, for neg­li­gence, and sought dam­ages for med­i­cal ex­penses and loss of in­come.</p>
    <p>Deny­ing neg­li­gence, the de­fen­dant coun­tered that Mr Ng had con­trib­uted to his in­jury by fail­ing to keep a proper look­out.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to de­fence pa­pers filed by coun­sel from Wong Thomas & Leong, staff of a nearby unit had ear­lier no­ticed the wet patch and placed a chair over it, but it was ap­par­ently re­moved.</p>
    <p>The de­fen­dant was not no­ti­fied to send a cleaner.</p>
    <p>The case was set for trial on July 1, where both coun­sel ap­peared be­fore Dis­trict Judge Eu­gene Teo and by con­sent, the de­fen­dant ac­cepted 60 per cent li­a­bil­ity for the ac­ci­dent, with the quan­tum payable to Mr Ng to be as­sessed separately by the State Courts Reg­is­trar.</p>
    <p>Lawyers are see­ing a rise in neg­li­gence claims in­volv­ing in­juries that have oc­curred in pub­lic places.</p>
    <p>Hoh Law Cor­po­ra­tion lawyer N. Srini­vasan said: “One rea­son is peo­ple are now more aware of their rights over com­pen­sa­tion for per­sonal in­juries un­like be­fore, when they prob­a­bly suf­fered in si­lence.”</p>
    <p>Clif­ford Law’s Ms Sandhu cited ex­am­ples from the cases she has han­dled, in­clud­ing a “trip and fall from a badly de­signed low step or car­pet, fall­ing branches or even fall­ing signs in shops”.</p>
    <p>She said there have also been cases in­volv­ing de­fec­tive play­ground equip­ment and bro­ken or un­even tiles or drain cov­ers.</p>
    <p>“All these is­sues arise from bad de­sign, ne­glect or lack of main­te­nance. These cases are even­tu­ally set­tled with the client get­ting fairly com­pen­sated for their in­juries and other losses. Only a small per­cent­age of these cases ac­tu­ally pro­ceed to trial.”</p>
    <p>Ms Sandhu added: “I have also seen a few un­for­tu­nate and bizarre cases, such as one where a lug­gage trol­ley rammed into my client.</p>
    <p>“In an­other case, the waiter ac­ci­den­tally dropped the first course plat­ter in a 10-course Chi­nese din­ner (the cold plat­ter) on my client’s head. The rep­utable ho­tel dis­claimed li­a­bil­ity un­til we said we would call the re­main­ing nine guests to give ev­i­dence.”</p>
    <p>Ms Sandhu said the case was even­tu­ally set­tled out of court with “my client get­ting her med­i­cal ex­penses, plas­tic sur­geon’s ex­penses, dry clean­ing and pain and suf­fer­ing com­pen­sa­tion”.</p>
    <p>In March this year, a teen cy­clist was hit and in­jured by a fall­ing tree branch near a lamp post in Po­tong Pasir Av­enue 1 where tree-prun­ing work was be­ing done.</p>
    <p>The left lane of the road was marked out by or­ange bar­ri­ers and cones as part of safety mea­sures. At is­sue is whether the cy­clist went past the cones and en­tered the work area when he was hit by the branch.</p>
    <p>The 14-year-old, who main­tained that he was cycling along the edge of the cor­doned area, suf­fered a mi­nor head and shoul­der in­jury as well as lac­er­a­tions, and re­ceived treat­ment at KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>The boy’s mother is seek­ing le­gal ac­tion on his be­half against the treep­run­ing con­trac­tor, if com­pen­sa­tion talks for neg­li­gence fails, said Ms Sandhu.</p>
