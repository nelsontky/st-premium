    <p>•</p>
    <p>Bei­jing is al­low­ing faster gains in the ren­minbi as it seeks to cheapen im­ports and bol­ster weak con­sumer spend­ing.</p>
    <p>That is one the­ory touted by DBS Bank and Mizuho Bank, which say a stronger ren­minbi is ideal for Bei­jing at a time when Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping is push­ing for a more self-re­liant econ­omy.</p>
    <p>That marks a shift from when of­fi­cials wor­ried that a strong ren­minbi would un­der­cut the na­tion’s ex­ports to the world.</p>
    <p>The daily cur­rency fix­ings show China’s equa­nim­ity to­wards ac­cel­er­at­ing gains in the ren­minbi, with the cen­tral bank re­frain­ing from send­ing clear warn­ing sig­nals to traders. That is even as the cur­rency gained nearly 5 per cent from late May ver­sus the dol­lar to its high­est level in more than a year.</p>
    <p>The fix­ings – a tool the Peo­ple’s Bank of China of­ten uses to limit cur­rency strength – have gen­er­ally been track­ing the mar­ket higher as the dol­lar has weak­ened.</p>
    <p>A stronger ex­change rate also helps re­move a flash­point in re­la­tions with the United States, with Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump hav­ing long ac­cused China of keep­ing the ren­minbi ar­ti­fi­cially weak.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, do­mes­tic banks will be more in­clined to hold a cur­rency that is not de­pre­ci­at­ing, which in turn would help Bei­jing re­duce the fi­nan­cial sec­tor’s reliance on the green­back.</p>
    <p>“Tol­er­ance to­wards a stronger yuan when it is fun­da­men­tally driven is go­ing to be high,” said Ms Wang Ju, direc­tor and se­nior for­eign ex­change strate­gist at HSBC</p>
    <p>Hold­ings in Hong Kong. “A stronger yuan would help China di­ver­sify away from the dol­lar and op­ti­mise its re­source al­lo­ca­tion.”</p>
    <p>The cur­rency’s rally since this year’s nadir in late May has made it one of the best per­form­ers in Asia, with the buying mo­men­tum still stand­ing close to the strong­est since Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>The ren­minbi’s large in­ter­e­strate premium over the yield on the dol­lar also helped to boost de­mand.</p>
    <p>Such strength is al­ready help­ing China, which was re­ported to be buying a record amount of Amer­i­can soya beans this year as lower prices help it boost pur­chases pledged un­der the trade deal. But still, the econ­omy re­mains frag­ile – the coun­try’s im­ports con­tracted in all but one month since March, while re­tail sales came out worse than econ­o­mists had ex­pected for five months in a row.</p>
    <p>“The stronger yuan could stim­u­late im­ports and fur­ther ex­pand the do­mes­tic con­sump­tion mar­ket,” said Mr Ken Cheung, chief Asia cur­rency strate­gist at Mizuho. “China’s lead­ers will be less tempted to use de­pre­ci­a­tion to stim­u­late the econ­omy, as the ex­port sec­tor plays a sec­ondary role in growth now.”</p>
    <p>But this does not mean Bei­jing will let the ren­minbi run wild.</p>
    <p>A key in­di­ca­tor of strength is the CFETS RMB In­dex, which tracks the ren­minbi against 24 peers. It shows the ren­minbi has ap­pre­ci­ated about 2.3 per cent against them since the start of last month.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral bank may set the fix­ing at weaker-than-ex­pected lev­els if the gauge jumps rapidly to a point where the strength eats into ex­ports, said Mr Tommy Ong, man­ag­ing direc­tor for trea­sury and mar­kets at DBS Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The ren­minbi last traded at 6.8395 per dol­lar.</p>
    <p>But for now, the ren­minbi has room to ad­vance fur­ther, said Mr Ong, who sees de­mand for the green­back be­ing re­duced af­ter the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in Novem­ber. “A stronger yuan is a bet­ter fit for China’s growth model,” he said, pre­dict­ing the cur­rency to hit 6.7 per dol­lar by the year end.</p>
