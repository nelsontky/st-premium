    <p>By Naomi Novik</p>
    <p>Del Rey/Pa­per­back/323 pages/ $29.96/Avail­able at bit.ly/Dead­lyE­du_NN</p>
    <p>In the Scholo­mance, a mag­i­cal academy that melds the ruth­less­ness of The Hunger Games with the lack­lus­tre health and safety stan­dards of Harry Pot­ter’s Hog­warts, you grad­u­ate or lit­er­ally die try­ing.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can au­thor Naomi Novik made her name with the his­tor­i­cal fan­tasy se­ries Te­meraire, which reimag­ined Napoleonic war­fare with dragons.</p>
    <p>A Deadly Ed­u­ca­tion, the first in a tril­ogy, does not reach the heights of her mag­nif­i­cent 2016 novel Up­rooted, though it man­ages to be a mor­da­ciously re­lat­able satire of the aca­demic rat race.</p>
    <p>Gal­adriel, El for short, is in her penul­ti­mate year at the Scholo­mance, where stu­dents spend their teenage years bon­ing up on spells, back­stab­bing one an­other and fend­ing off malefi­caria, a night­mar­ish ar­ray of mon­sters – soul­suck­ers, blood-clangers, maw­mouths and more – keen on de­vour­ing young magic users.</p>
    <p>Grad­u­a­tion in­volves dump­ing the se­nior co­hort in a hall full of hun­gry malefi­caria and leav­ing them to fight their way out. Sur­vivors get a shot at join­ing elite en­claves, but most do not make it.</p>
    <p>El’s Welsh mother was preg­nant with her when her In­dian father sac­ri­ficed him­self to get mother and child out of the Scholo­mance.</p>
    <p>Her own odds are not good. She has highly de­struc­tive pow­ers she can­not con­trol and is also a mis­an­thropic loner. When all the cool kids are form­ing cliques to sur­vive grad­u­a­tion, even eat­ing in the cafe­te­ria alone is a death wish.</p>
    <p>El could go full dark sor­cer­ess and mas­sacre her way out, but she wants to grad­u­ate cleanly. Though she may just kill Orion Lake, the school’s golden boy, who has an an­noy­ing ten­dency to save her life.</p>
    <p>Novik, typ­i­cally an ex­cel­lent world-builder, has con­structed a de­light­fully com­plex sys­tem of magic, though much of this has to be con­veyed via ex­po­si­tion dumps.</p>
    <p>The stu­dent body, read­ers are of­ten re­minded, is a very in­ter­na­tional one, which may read like check­box di­ver­sity but is a re­fresh­ing change from the Euro­cen­trism of much mag­i­cal cam­pus fic­tion.</p>
    <p>Be­neath all the ac­tion runs a cri­tique of how even mer­i­to­cratic ed­u­ca­tion sys­tems are win­nowed by priv­i­lege.</p>
    <p>En­clave kids like Orion come in loaded with re­serves of power, while stu­dents with­out con­nec­tions, like El, are brought in chiefly as malefi­caria fod­der.</p>
    <p>El is a caus­tic nar­ra­tor, zigzag­ging be­tween dark hu­mour and ex­is­ten­tial de­spair. A Deadly Ed­u­ca­tion may suf­fer from grow­ing pains, but I would rel­ish watch­ing its hero­ine snark her way through a few more semesters.</p>
    <p>If you like this, read: The Fin­ish­ing School quar­tet by Gail Car­riger, be­gin­ning with Eti­quette And Es­pi­onage (Lit­tle, Brown, 2013, $17.39, avail­able at bit.ly/EtiEsp_GC). Tom­boy­ish Sophro­nia en­rols in Made­moi­selle Geral­dine’s Fin­ish­ing Academy for Young Ladies of Qual­ity, a steam­punk school of man­ners where she will learn to fin­ish ev­ery­thing, in­clud­ing other peo­ple.</p>
