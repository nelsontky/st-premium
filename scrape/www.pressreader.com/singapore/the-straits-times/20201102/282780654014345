    <p>To play a zom­bie who wants to blend into the hu­man world and un­cover his back­story, South Korean ac­tor Choi Jin-hyuk, 34, had to not only smear on un­dead make-up, but also try raw in­testines.</p>
    <p>Here are five things to know about his new role in the comedic K-drama Zom­bie De­tec­tive.</p>
    <p>1 IT WAS AWK­WARD AT FIRST</p>
    <p>For Choi, known for his roles in dra­mas such as Tun­nel (2017) and The Last Em­press (2018), Zom­bie De­tec­tive was a new chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>He tells The Straits Times over email: “I guess it’s be­cause it’s a genre I’ve never taken on be­fore, so I couldn’t help but feel awk­ward with the role in the be­gin­ning.”</p>
    <p>Though the zom­bie genre is well­trod­den in South Korea with films like Train To Bu­san (2016) and this year’s #Alive and Net­flix se­ries King­dom (2019 to pre­sent), Choi did not re­fer to other projects for his role.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think I’ve seen a movie which fea­tures a zom­bie who wants to be a hu­man just like how my char­ac­ter Kim Moo-young does,” says Choi, whose last role was a re­venge seeker in sci­encefic­tion tale Ru­gal (2020).</p>
    <p>2 HE SCARED CHIL­DREN</p>
    <p>Zom­bie De­tec­tive has had sev­eral cameo ap­pear­ances from celebri­ties, in­clud­ing tele­vi­sion host Yoo Jae-suk and Sam Ham­ming­ton, a South Korea-based New Zealan­der co­me­dian.</p>
    <p>Ham­ming­ton’s sons Wil­liam, four, and Bent­ley, three, – who ap­pear on par­ent­ing re­al­ity se­ries The Re­turn Of Su­per­man (2013 to pre­sent) – vis­ited the set but were not ex­actly pleased to see Choi in his zom­bie get-up.</p>
    <p>He says: “They were re­ally cute, but I was re­ally sorry about how they ended up cry­ing af­ter tak­ing one look at me and got scared.</p>
    <p>“It was a pity that our time film­ing to­gether was so short, or I could have got closer to them.”</p>
    <p>3 TRY­ING RAW IN­TESTINES</p>
    <p>One of Choi’s many chal­lenges on this se­ries was ac­tu­ally put­ting in his mouth what his zom­bie char­ac­ter eats – raw an­i­mal parts.</p>
    <p>He says: “In or­der to vividly act out a zom­bie who has to con­sume raw food, I did ac­tu­ally put the raw tripe (cow stom­ach) and chicken in my mouth. I thought they had a ‘fishy’ smell.</p>
    <p>“I felt like I should never eat such a thing ever again. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to for­get such a feel­ing.”</p>
    <p>4 HE TURNED INTO A K-POP DANCER</p>
    <p>In an early episode, Choi’s char­ac­ter Moo-young does a zom­bie-like dance to boy band 2PM’s Heart­beat (2009), with K-pop boy band A.C.E as back­ground dancers.</p>
    <p>His sleek body rolls im­pressed view­ers.</p>
    <p>“Choi says: “I prac­tised danc­ing for a long time to make it look nat­u­ral. It was great that my ef­forts could be seen.”</p>
    <p>5 NEW HORI­ZONS AHEAD</p>
    <p>With roles like a ro­man­tic hero in I Need Ro­mance (2011) and now a zom­bie de­tec­tive, Choi is still game to try new gen­res.</p>
    <p>“I took on Zom­bie De­tec­tive be­cause I wanted to pre­sent au­di­ences some­thing new that I’ve never tried be­fore.</p>
    <p>“If I get a chance, I would like to take on the noir genre – some­thing dark and deep.</p>
