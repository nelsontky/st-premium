    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES Os­car-win­ning pro­ducer Michael Sugar has raised US$30 mil­lion (S$39.7 mil­lion) to turn his bou­tique man­age­ment and pro­duc­tion com­pany into the next big Hol­ly­wood tal­ent shop.</p>
    <p>Mr Sugar, whose clients in­clude di­rec­tors Steven Soder­bergh and Cary Joji Fuku­naga, raised the money from in­vestors Swan & Leg­end Ven­ture Part­ners, which has also backed celebrity chef Jose An­dres’ restau­rant group, and MRC, the Hol­ly­wood stu­dio that pro­duced the movie Knives Out (2019) and tele­vi­sion se­ries Ozark (2017 to present).</p>
    <p>Mr Sugar plans to use this new cap­i­tal to move his com­pany, Su­gar23, into pod­cast­ing and book pub­lish­ing. He also aims to ex­pand its tal­ent-rep­re­sen­ta­tion busi­ness by hir­ing as many as 20 man­agers over the next 12 months.</p>
    <p>Mr Sugar has al­ready iden­ti­fied one new col­league – Ms Mered­ith Wechter, who rep­re­sents Won­der Woman (2017) star Gal Gadot and Ja­son Mo­moa of Aqua­man (2018), is re­port­edly set to join him.</p>
    <p>Mr Sugar is a Hol­ly­wood rar­ity – both a man­ager to top clients and a suc­cess­ful pro­ducer. He is hop­ing to cap­i­talise on a mo­ment of up­heaval in tra­di­tional tal­ent rep­re­sen­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Agen­cies have all cut staff due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, em­bold­en­ing sev­eral top rep­re­sen­ta­tives to strike out on their own and form new com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Many agents are turn­ing to man­age­ment be­cause man­agers are able to pro­duce shows un­der Cal­i­for­nia law, giv­ing them a po­ten­tially larger share of their clients’ busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Long-time Wil­liam Mor­ris En­deavor agent Theresa Kang-Lowe set up a man­age­ment com­pany and se­cured a pro­duc­tion deal with Ap­ple, while her col­league Phil Sun joined the stu­dio Macro to run its man­age­ment busi­ness.</p>
    <p>For­mer Cre­ative Artists Agency agent Peter Mi­celli, mean­while, formed Range Me­dia Part­ners with back­ing from hedge-fund bil­lion­aire Steve Co­hen, and has al­ready poached top agents from across Hol­ly­wood, as well as lur­ing clients such as Watch­men (2019) cre­ator Da­mon Lin­de­lof.</p>
    <p>Mr Sugar was early to this trend. Su­gar23 has al­ready pro­duced Dickinson (2019 to present) for Ap­ple TV+ and Ma­niac (2018) for Net­flix.</p>
    <p>He formed Su­gar23 in 2017 af­ter years at en­ter­tain­ment com­pany Anony­mous Con­tent, where he rep­re­sented top film-mak­ers and pro­duced projects like Spotlight (2015), which won the Os­car for Best Pic­ture. Mr Sugar’s client Josh Singer co-wrote the script.</p>
    <p>Mr Sugar closed a deal with Net­flix af­ter strik­ing out on his own, giv­ing the stream­ing ser­vice exclusive rights to all scripted tele­vi­sion projects pro­duced by Su­gar23 and a first op­tion on all films.</p>
    <p>He is build­ing the team to help ex­pand his com­pany, hir­ing a chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer and gen­eral coun­sel, and seek­ing heads of a new pub­lish­ing im­print and pod­cast di­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>The idea, he says, is to give any client the op­por­tu­nity to cre­ate some­thing in just about any arena, be it a di­rec­tor who wants to write a book or an ac­tor who wants to pro­duce a doc­u­men­tary.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing been in the ser­vice of artistes for 25-plus years, I saw there was op­por­tu­nity across mul­ti­me­dia,” he said. “I’m try­ing to not be a ser­vice busi­ness. I’m try­ing to cre­ate a scal­able me­dia busi­ness with ac­tual as­sets.”</p>
