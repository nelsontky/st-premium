    <p>OAKLAND • The FBI be­lieves that a Chi­nese re­searcher, ac­cused of visa fraud for hid­ing her af­fil­i­a­tion with the Chi­nese mil­i­tary, has been holed up in the Chi­nese con­sulate in San Fran­cisco for a month, ac­cord­ing to court fil­ings.</p>
    <p>The fil­ings in the US Dis­trict Court in San Fran­cisco said that Juan Tang, who worked at the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, Davis, falsely claimed on her visa ap­pli­ca­tion that she had not served in the Chi­nese mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>But in­ves­ti­ga­tors found pho­tos of her in a Chi­nese mil­i­tary uni­form and dis­cov­ered she had worked as a re­searcher at China’s Air Force Mil­i­tary Med­i­cal Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>The Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion (FBI) ques­tioned her on June 20, and later she went to the con­sulate where the FBI be­lieves she has re­mained.</p>
    <p>She was charged with visa fraud on June 26. US law en­force­ment agents can­not en­ter a for­eign em­bassy or con­sulate un­less in­vited, and top of­fi­cials such as am­bas­sadors have diplo­matic im­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese con­sulate in San Fran­cisco and Tang could not be im­me­di­ately reached for com­ment. The US State Depart­ment did not re­ply to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>The news, first re­ported by Ax­ios, comes as US-China ten­sions flare, with the US giv­ing China 72 hours to close its con­sulate in Hous­ton amid ac­cu­sa­tions of spy­ing.</p>
    <p>China has vowed “firm coun­ter­mea­sures” against the US.</p>
    <p>US pros­e­cu­tors have ar­gued against bail for an­other Chi­nese re­searcher, Chen Song, who was also ar­rested for visa fraud. Song worked at Stan­ford Univer­sity con­duct­ing neu­ro­log­i­cal re­search, the court fil­ings said.</p>
    <p>The court fil­ings also men­tion two other re­cently charged Chi­nese re­searchers who worked at the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, San Fran­cisco, and Duke Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>The FBI has warned uni­ver­si­ties for years about the risk of in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty theft by for­eign re­searchers, and the US has tight­ened re­stric­tions on stu­dent visas as well.</p>
