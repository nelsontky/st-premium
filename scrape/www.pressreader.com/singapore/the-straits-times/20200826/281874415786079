    <p>WASH­ING­TON • More than two dozen for­mer Repub­li­can US law­mak­ers, in­clud­ing for­mer sen­a­tor Jeff Flake, en­dorsed Demo­crat Joe Bi­den for pres­i­dent as the Repub­li­can Na­tional Con­ven­tion opened on Monday, a re­buke to United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump by mem­bers of his own party.</p>
    <p>The 27 for­mer mem­bers of Congress joined a “Repub­li­cans for Bi­den” ini­tia­tive or­gan­ised by the Bi­den cam­paign to en­cour­age Repub­li­can sup­port for the Demo­crat, the Bi­den cam­paign said. They cited Mr Trump’s “cor­rup­tion, de­struc­tion of democ­racy, bla­tant dis­re­gard for moral de­cency and ur­gent need to get the coun­try back on course” as rea­sons for the move, ac­cord­ing to a Bi­den cam­paign state­ment.</p>
    <p>“I was a Repub­li­can l ong be­fore the pres­i­dent ever called him­self one, and I’ll be a Repub­li­can l ong af­ter i den­ti­fy­ing as such is no longer use­ful to him,” Mr Flake said in a 16-minute video ex­plain­ing his de­ci­sion to en­dorse Mr Bi­den and vote for a Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee for the first time.</p>
    <p>“Given what we have ex­pe­ri­enced over the past four years, it’s not enough just to reg­is­ter our dis­ap­proval of the pres­i­dent. We need to elect some­one else in his place, some­one who will stop the chaos and re­verse the dam­age,” he added.</p>
    <p>The for­mer l aw­mak­ers are only the lat­est Repub­li­can group to en­dorse Mr Bi­den and op­pose Mr Trump in the Nov 3 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the Lin­coln Project, one of the most prom­i­nent Repub­li­can-backed groups op­pos­ing Mr Trump, said on Monday that for­mer Repub­li­can Na­tional Com­mit­tee chair­man Michael Steele had joined it as a se­nior ad­viser.</p>
    <p>“The chair be­hind the Res­o­lute Desk has al­ways been big­ger than any po­lit­i­cal party,” Mr Steele said. “Sadly, we have wit­nessed its oc­cu­pant de­volve into prey­ing upon fears and re­sent­ments with nar­cis­sism that nur­tures only chaos and con­fu­sion. Lead­er­ship is needed now more than ever.”</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, one of the Lin­coln Project’s co-founders, Mr Ge­orge Con­way, and his wife, Trump ad­viser Kellyanne Con­way, stepped down from their po­lit­i­cal roles, cit­ing a need to spend time with fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Last week, 73 for­mer Repub­li­can na­tional se­cu­rity of­fi­cials, in­clud­ing for­mer chiefs of the Cen­tral In­tel­li­gence Agency and Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion, en­dorsed Mr Bi­den while call­ing Mr Trump un­fit to serve.</p>
