    <p>•</p>
    <p>French po­lice have de­tained a for­mer flat­mate of a man ar­rested over an at­tack with a meat cleaver that left two wounded out­side the for­mer of­fices of satir­i­cal weekly Char­lie Hebdo, a ju­di­cial source said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Po­lice also late Friday re­leased another man who was close to the scene of the at­tack in Paris but who was con­firmed to have been a wit­ness who had “chased the as­sailant”, the source said.</p>
    <p>Seven peo­ple are be­ing held in con­nec­tion with the at­tack, which came three weeks into the trial of sus­pected ac­com­plices in the 2015 mas­sacre of the news­pa­per’s staff.</p>
    <p>They in­clude the “main per­pe­tra­tor”, who was ar­rested not far from the scene, pros­e­cu­tors said.</p>
    <p>France’s PNAT spe­cial­ist anti-ter­ror pros­e­cu­tion of­fice on Friday said it had opened a probe into charges of “at­tempted mur­der re­lated to a ter­ror­ist en­ter­prise” against him as well as “con­spir­acy with ter­ror­ists”.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to PNAT head Jean</p>
    <p>Fran­cois Ri­card, the sus­pect was an 18-year-old man.</p>
    <p>Ini­tial in­di­ca­tions were that he was born in Pak­istan. French In­te­rior Min­is­ter Ger­ald Dar­manin on Friday said the at­tack was “clearly an act of Is­lamist ter­ror­ism”.</p>
    <p>The sus­pect has con­fessed to the at­tack, sources close to the in­ves­ti­ga­tion said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The man “takes re­spon­si­bil­ity for his ac­tion which he places in the con­text of the re­pub­li­ca­tion of car­toons” of Prophet Mo­hammed in Char­lie Hebdo, one of the sources said.</p>
    <p>Char­lie Hebdo has an­gered many Mus­lims around the world by pub­lish­ing car­toons of Prophet Mo­hammed over the years and, in a de­fi­ant ges­ture, reprinted some of the car­i­ca­tures ahead of the trial.</p>
    <p>Twelve peo­ple, in­clud­ing some of France’s most cel­e­brated car­toon­ists, were killed in the at­tack on Char­lie Hebdo by Is­lamist gun­men on Jan 7, 2015.</p>
    <p>Paris po­lice said two peo­ple were “crit­i­cally wounded” in Friday’s at­tack near the pa­per’s for­mer of­fices in the French cap­i­tal’s 11th district. Char­lie Hebdo’s new ad­dress is kept se­cret.</p>
    <p>A source close to the in­ves­ti­ga­tion con­firmed to Agence FrancePres­se on Friday that a large meat cleaver found near the scene was used by the at­tacker.</p>
    <p>The ju­di­cial source said yes­ter­day that a man was taken in for ques­tion­ing who had been a flat­mate of the main sus­pect when he was liv­ing in so­cial hous­ing in the Val-d’Oise depart­ment north of Paris.</p>
    <p>Five more peo­ple ar­rested in the Paris sub­urb of Pantin dur­ing a search of a prop­erty linked to the main sus­pect were also be­ing held, a ju­di­cial source said late on Friday.</p>
    <p>The Premieres Lignes news pro­duc­tion agency said the wounded were its em­ploy­ees – a man and a woman tak­ing a cig­a­rette break out­side.</p>
    <p>The com­pany spe­cialises in in­ves­tiga­tive re­ports and pro­duces the prize-win­ning Cash In­ves­ti­ga­tion pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The stab­bing came dur­ing the trial of 14 al­leged ac­com­plices of Said and Cherif Kouachi, the broth­ers who were per­pe­tra­tors of the 2015 at­tack that was claimed by a branch of Al-Qaeda.</p>
    <p>A fe­male po­lice of­fi­cer was killed a day later, fol­lowed the next day by the killing of four men in a hostage­tak­ing at a Jewish su­per­mar­ket by gun­man Am­edy Coulibaly.</p>
    <p>France has ex­pe­ri­enced a wave of at­tacks by Is­lamist mil­i­tants in the past few years.</p>
    <p>Bomb­ings and shoot­ings in Novem­ber 2015 at the Bat­a­clan the­atre and sites around Paris killed 130 peo­ple, and in July 2016 an Is­lamist mil­i­tant drove a truck through a crowd cel­e­brat­ing Bastille Day in Nice, killing 86.</p>
