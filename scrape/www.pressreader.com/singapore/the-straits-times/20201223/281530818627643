    <p>No breach in oper­a­tions has yet been dis­cov­ered at the Man­darin Or­chard Sin­ga­pore ho­tel, where sev­eral Covid-19 cases who had served their stay-home no­tice (SHN) are sus­pected to be linked, said Min­is­ter for Ed­u­ca­tion Lawrence Wong yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But “what hap­pened in Man­darin Or­chard is yet an­other re­minder that things can go wrong”, said Mr Wong, who co-chairs a multi-min­istry task force tack­ling the coro­n­avirus here.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) had said that it was prob­ing 13 coro­n­avirus cases among peo­ple who had served their SHN at Man­darin Or­chard.</p>
    <p>The in­di­vid­u­als, who came from 10 dif­fer­ent coun­tries, were in­fected by coro­n­avirus strains with</p>
    <p>“high ge­netic sim­i­lar­ity”, which im­plied that the in­fec­tions might have come from one source.</p>
    <p>As at Mon­day, 11 Man­darin Or­chard staff had tested pos­i­tive in sero­log­i­cal tests for the virus and this in­di­cates likely past in­fec­tions of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>MOH also con­ducted poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) tests for 571 staff of Man­darin Or­chard, and all the re­sults came back neg­a­tive for Covid-19. This means there is no on­go­ing in­fec­tion among the staff of the ho­tel.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to re­porters yes­ter­day, Mr Wong said Sin­ga­pore’s SHN regime has, by and large, been ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>“We have had many, many months of ex­pe­ri­ence with SHN,” he said, adding that ho­tel op­er­a­tors have been re­spon­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“They have taken it upon them­selves to en­sure that pro­to­cols, se­cu­rity, ev­ery­thing is done prop</p>
    <p>erly. In this case, we did not de­tect a breach yet. But some­how, some­thing... hap­pened. We don’t quite know what is it.”</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions into the mat­ter will con­tinue to be car­ried out and Mr Wong said that there are many pos­si­ble ways the virus could have spread in the in­ci­dent, such as through sur­faces or ho­tel staff.</p>
    <p>“No one knows, but it shows you how eas­ily...the virus can spread,” he added.</p>
    <p>“And that’s why, once again, all of us need to take this se­ri­ously and re­mind our­selves why we should stay vig­i­lant, stay alert and keep our guard up.”</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing con­cerns about ho­tels be­ing used as SHN fa­cil­i­ties for trav­ellers en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore while be­ing open for stay­ca­tions to ho­tel guests, Mr Wong said that the oper­a­tions for ar­eas in Man­darin Or­chard used for SHN and hol­i­day­mak­ers are kept sep­a­rate.</p>
    <p>The wing of the ho­tel that houses those on SHN is sep­a­rate from the wing that houses those on stay­ca­tions. The SHN wing is also sep­a­rate from other ar­eas of the ho­tel open to lo­cals and mem­bers of the pub­lic, said Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>“Pro­to­cols (and) safety ar­range­ments are al­ready put in place,” he added.</p>
