    <p>So many stay­cays, so lit­tle time. What makes this ho­tel spe­cial?</p>
    <p>I find my­self smack in the heart of the Tan­jong Pa­gar busi­ness district, with sky­scrapers fram­ing one side of my ho­tel win­dow view and rows of colo­nial-era shop­houses on the other. Yet, it feels like a hide­away in the heart of the cen­tral busi­ness district.</p>
    <p>Oa­sia Ho­tel Down­town in Peck Seah Street may be dubbed a “busi­ness ho­tel”, but it is an oa­sis in a densely pop­u­lated ur­ban sprawl.</p>
    <p>For starters, the 27-storey build­ing, which was de­signed by Woha Ar­chi­tects and launched in 2016, is un­like other build­ings in the CBD.</p>
    <p>Its “liv­ing tower” fa­cade is con­structed with a dis­tinc­tive red alu­minium mesh cladding that sup­ports more than 20 species of creep­ers, plants and flow­ers that are slowly trans­form­ing the ex­te­rior into a lush green mo­saic.</p>
    <p>In­side, there is a sky ter­race decked out with more green­ery and trees that fil­ter light to cool the in­ter­nal spa­ces. Three wa­ter bod­ies – an in­fin­ity pool at Level 21 and two rooftop pools – com­plete the ar­chi­tec­tural gar­den of Eden, pre­par­ing one’s body, mind and soul for an idyl­lic so­journ.</p>
    <p>First im­pres­sions?</p>
    <p>From the get-go, I can­not help but revel in the at­ten­tion from so­cially dis­tanced yet ea­ger-to-please ho­tel staff – from the ground floor to the lounge and check-in area at the 21st floor to the room but­lers on my 27th-floor suite.</p>
    <p>My room is small but cosy and boasts a panoramic view of the city sky­line, which gives me an ap­petite for a hearty lunch.</p>
    <p>In­stead of room ser­vice, I call the concierge by mis­take: “I’d love to have lamb de­liv­ered to my room, please?”</p>
    <p>There is a slight hes­i­ta­tion on the other end of the line but, after a few ex­changes, I set­tle my or­der.</p>
    <p>Or so I think. After a few min­utes, a flus­tered young man, per­spir­ing pro­fusely, ap­pears with a 2m-tall brass floor lamp and asks: “Where would you like your lamp, madam?”</p>
    <p>I try to ex­plain my­self, but in vain. We agree to blame it on poor in­flec­tion and crossed wires. How do you fault ho­tel staff who would go to such lamps to please?</p>
    <p>What’s worth in­dulging in?</p>
    <p>The high­light of my stay is a four­course din­ner at Oso Ris­torante. The award-win­ning Ital­ian restau­rant, which moved from Bukit Pa­soh to Oa­sia in 2017, has the one dessert I can­not get at any other restau­rant: tiramisu sans al­co­hol.</p>
    <p>I am not a food critic be­cause I have a host of di­etary re­stric­tions. I am al­ler­gic to al­co­hol and, as an In­dian Per­anakan – Chetti Melaka – who ab­stains from beef and pork, I am un­able to en­joy most dishes on restau­rant menus.</p>
    <p>Owner Stephane Colleoni, who has helmed Oso since 2004, and head chef Diego Chiarini serve seafood op­tions that will please even the pick­i­est eater. The al­co­hol-free, su­per-light tiramisu is the ic­ing on my cake and the high point of the evening.</p>
    <p>What else is there to do?</p>
    <p>For fit­ness buffs, the aquaspin classes are a must.</p>
    <p>Held in the morn­ings, these workouts are for guests who want to test the lim­its of their car­dio en­durance. Sta­tion­ary bi­cy­cles are se­cured to the floor of a rooftop pool for un­der­wa­ter cy­cling that works out ev­ery fi­bre of the lower body for 45 min­utes to an hour.</p>
    <p>There are also yoga classes to de­stress and re­align your en­er­gies.</p>
    <p>Ver­dict: Bliss or miss?</p>
    <p>The 3D2N pack­age has all the perks for har­ried city-slick­ers in need of a re­boot after a try­ing year. Oa­sia Ho­tel Down­town’s eclec­tic mix of wa­ter sports, yoga and fine din­ing tick all the boxes for ring­ing in the new year on a more up­beat note.</p>
    <p>Hot tip</p>
    <p>Laze in the in­fin­ity pool with a drink, or catch the sun­set and the stun­ning views of the Sin­ga­pore sky­line for your In­sta­gram feed.</p>
