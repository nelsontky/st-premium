    <p>Sin­ga­porean graphic novel The Art Of Char­lie Chan Hock Chye (2015) will make its leap to the screen as an an­i­mated se­ries.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional pro­ducer and dis­trib­u­tor 108 Me­dia will be adapt­ing the Eis­ner Award-win­ning book by Sin­ga­porean car­toon­ist Sonny Liew.</p>
    <p>108 Me­dia, which is head­quar­tered in Sin­ga­pore, also picked up the rights for Ma­rina Bay Sins (2015), a crime thriller by Sin­ga­pore-based Bri­tish hu­morist Neil Humphreys; and Moonrise, Sun­set, a 1996 mys­tery novel by the late lo­cal literary pi­o­neer Gopal Baratham.</p>
    <p>All three projects are at the scriptwrit­ing stage. They will be pro­duced and shot in Sin­ga­pore and tar­geted for in­ter­na­tional re­lease next year or in 2022.</p>
    <p>108 Me­dia pres­i­dent Justin Deimen, 35, who is co-pro­duc­ing the three adap­ta­tions, said: “As a born and bred Sin­ga­porean who has de­voured all man­ner of lo­cal fare since I was young, I’m burst­ing with pride to be able to adapt the work of some of our coun­try’s ab­so­lute best writers – and th­ese books in par­tic­u­lar – into dif­fer­ent spa­ces and places around the world.”</p>
    <p>The Art Of Char­lie Chan Hock Chye, a land­mark work in lo­cal comics that de­picts Sin­ga­pore’s po­lit­i­cal his­tory through the eyes of a fic­tional car­toon­ist, is be­ing adapted by young Sin­ga­porean writers Jow Zhi Wei, Jer­rold Chong, Shelby Goh and Roshan Singh as a se­ries of six half-hour episodes.</p>
    <p>Liew, 46, said many in­di­vid­u­als and com­pa­nies had ap­proached him about adapt­ing his highly com­plex graphic novel, but none of them could ac­tu­ally work out how.</p>
    <p>“The dif­fer­ence with 108 Me­dia was that it put to­gether a team of writers to fig­ure out how to break down the book and make the adap­ta­tion work. I think that showed a level of com­mit­ment the oth­ers didn’t quite have.”</p>
    <p>He said the thought of a screen adap­ta­tion was “ex­cit­ing and a lit­tle bit scary”.</p>
    <p>“As a comic artist, you have a lot of con­trol over the prod­uct, whereas once you let it go into the world and other peo­ple get in­volved, it will change. It’s go­ing to be in­ter­est­ing to see how the other peo­ple in­volved see this in a new medium.”</p>
    <p>Ma­rina Bay Sins, the first book in Humphreys’ gritty crime se­ries about po­lice in­spec­tor Stan­ley Low, will be adapted into Low, a tele­vi­sion se­ries of eight hour-long episodes set in Sin­ga­pore and Lon­don, with Bri­tain-based direc­tor Paris Zar­cilla as show-run­ner.</p>
    <p>Its se­quel nov­els, Rich Kill Poor Kill (2016) and the up­com­ing Bloody For­eign­ers, will be adapted as sub­se­quent sea­sons.</p>
    <p>Humphreys, 45, said: “I can’t tell you how ex­cited I am that In­spec­tor Low is go­ing to be un­leashed upon the world. Hav­ing lived with him in­side my head for five years, I think it’s only fair that ev­ery­one else gets to see this un­cen­sored, un­stop­pable, mis­an­thropic de­tec­tive on screen.”</p>
    <p>Moonrise, Sun­set, in which a young Chi­nese-In­dian man wakes up next to his mur­dered fi­ancee and has to prove his in­no­cence, is be­ing adapted as a four-episode lim­ited se­ries, di­rected by Sin­ga­pore’s K. Ra­jagopal and Malaysia’s Shan­jhey Peru­mal.</p>
    <p>The cast in­cludes lo­cal theatre vet­er­ans Neo Swee Lin and Lim Kay Siu, as well as Re­bekah Sangeetha Do­rai, who will play Vanitha Sun­dram, the mur­dered woman.</p>
    <p>Baratham’s son Sayana Baratham, 57, called the adap­ta­tion a “won­der­ful way” to re­ju­ve­nate the work of his late fa­ther, a neu­ro­sur­geon and award-win­ning au­thor who died in 2002.</p>
    <p>“It will be fas­ci­nat­ing to see his char­ac­ters and vi­sion of Sin­ga­pore brought to life on screen,” he says.</p>
