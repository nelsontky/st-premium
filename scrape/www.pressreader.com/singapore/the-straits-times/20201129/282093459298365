    <p>The im­port of shrimp from Saudi Ara­bia ex­em­pli­fies how far Sin­ga­pore has been cast­ing its net to en­sure food se­cu­rity, in­clud­ing for an item that is quite a staple for dishes here. Sin­ga­pore im­ports prawns from all over the world, in­clud­ing neigh­bours such as Thai­land, Malaysia and In­done­sia, and places as far as Canada and Ecuador. Saudi Ara­bia’s place in the sup­ply chain rep­re­sents the con­tin­u­ing ef­forts be­ing made to di­ver­sify sources. Bring­ing in frozen shrimp from Saudi Ara­bia, the first time Sin­ga­pore is do­ing so from the Mid­dle Eastern king­dom, could spark greater trade be­tween the two coun­tries as well in an eco­nomic spin-off that ce­ments their broader re­la­tion­ship. Such ini­tia­tives are nec­es­sary, along with an in­crease in lo­cal food pro­duc­tion, so the na­tion is not held hostage by food short­age or other crises.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Sin­ga­pore Food Agency, the coun­try im­ports more than 90 per cent of its food. In 2018, lo­cal farms pro­duced only 13 per cent of veg­eta­bles, 9 per cent of fish, and 24 per cent of eggs. Con­se­quently, Sin­ga­pore is a pric­etaker on the global food mar­ket. Such de­pen­dence can make the coun­try vul­ner­a­ble not only to price fluc­tu­a­tions, but also to out­breaks of food dis­eases, the clo­sure of ports in ex­port­ing na­tions, or to in­im­i­cal po­lit­i­cal changes. Di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion of food sup­ply sources makes Sin­ga­pore more se­cure as a so­ci­ety. The key is to have a sense of which sup­ply chains might be dis­rupted, and to be able to place al­ter­na­tive or­ders and se­cure sup­plies ahead of time. That ap­proach must be com­ple­mented by pro­mot­ing lo­cal pro­duc­tion as an im­por­tant sec­ondary strat­egy in en­sur­ing the re­silience of food sup­plies. Sin­ga­pore­ans need to sup­port such ef­forts, in­clud­ing by check­ing out their near­est mar­kets for lo­cally pro­duced eggs, veg­eta­bles and fish, thus help­ing the farms be­hind them to sur­vive.</p>
