    <p>As 2021 ap­proaches, many peo­ple might be mak­ing res­o­lu­tions to start pos­i­tive habits, es­pe­cially after a year of dis­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>But how can you op­ti­mise your chances of mak­ing good habits stick and part­ing ways with bad ones?</p>
    <p>First, un­der­stand the sci­ence be­hind habits, which re­port­edly make up more than 40 per cent of the ac­tions peo­ple per­form each day, ac­cord­ing to a 2006 pa­per by a Duke Univer­sity re­searcher.</p>
    <p>Ms Joy Chen, a clin­i­cal psy­chol­o­gist at the Na­tional Univer­sity Health Sys­tem’s Mind Sci­ence Cen­tre, said form­ing a habit in­volves a self-re­in­forc­ing cy­cle with three el­e­ments – a trig­ger, be­hav­iour and re­ward.</p>
    <p>A cue trig­gers the brain to ini­ti­ate a be­hav­iour. The brain then an­tic­i­pates the re­ward that arises from the ac­tion. A per­son will per­form the be­hav­iour when the cue is present again.</p>
    <p>A bad habit is hard to break when the trig­ger is al­ways present and the re­ward is “strong and fas­tact­ing”, said Ms Chen.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, a pow­er­ful ex­ter­nal trig­ger for a smoker would be car­ry­ing a pack of cig­a­rettes, mak­ing smok­ing easy to do, she said. The in­ter­nal trig­ger could be con­stant thoughts of want­ing to smoke. The tem­po­rary re­ward would be a sud­den sense of relief when smok­ing.</p>
    <p>To break a bad habit, Ms Chen said it is important to be aware of the trig­ger that causes it. Un­der­stand­ing the re­ward you can get from the be­hav­iour is also cru­cial.</p>
    <p>She said peo­ple should ask them­selves: “Does it (the habit) help me get some­thing more pleas­ant or avoid some­thing un­pleas­ant? Is it ben­e­fi­cial in the long run, or does it pro­vide just tem­po­rary relief?”</p>
    <p>Un­der­stand­ing the trig­ger and re­ward can help one dis­cern if the habit is help­ful and make it eas­ier to stop, she said.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, un­der­grad­u­ate Sh­eryl Ng, 26, used to drink bub­ble tea, which is high in calo­ries, at least five times a week. It was her go-to drink to re­lieve stress.</p>
    <p>“It was very dif­fi­cult to stop drink­ing it. I had to break the habit slowly,” she said.</p>
    <p>She cut her in­take to three cups a week, then one, un­til she weaned her­self off com­pletely.</p>
    <p>When she has the urge to have bub­ble tea, she has wa­ter or an iso­tonic drink in­stead.</p>
    <p>Mr Des­mond Soh, a clin­i­cal psy­chol­o­gist at Annabelle Psy­chol­ogy, said Ms Ng’s re­peated ac­tion of drink­ing bub­ble tea when she was stressed formed a strong con­nec­tion in the brain, caus­ing it to go on au­topi­lot. To break her habit, Ms Ng had to make a con­scious de­ci­sion to drink wa­ter in­stead of bub­ble tea when­ever she felt stressed.</p>
    <p>But do not ex­pect a habit to be bro­ken or built quickly. A 2009 study by Univer­sity Col­lege London re­searcher Phillippa Lally found that it took 18 days to about eight months to form a new habit. Ms Ng, for in­stance, took al­most six months to stop drink­ing bub­ble tea.</p>
    <p>Another way to break a bad habit is to re­duce one’s ex­po­sure to the cue that en­cour­ages it, as men­tioned in self-help book Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones (2018).</p>
    <p>When it comes to forg­ing new habits, rep­e­ti­tion is key. The sci­ence of it is tied to neu­ro­plas­tic­ity, the brain’s abil­ity to change and adapt through growth and re­or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“Our brain forms con­nec­tions be­tween neu­rons and the more you do some­thing, the more the con­nec­tion is be­ing used, and thus the stronger it be­comes, form­ing a habit,” said Mr Soh.</p>
    <p>Having en­vi­ron­men­tal cues like post-it notes can help.</p>
    <p>This was how Ms Eli­cia Chan got into the habit of ex­er­cis­ing. The 28-year-old, who works in the hos­pi­tal­ity sec­tor, would seek out mo­ti­va­tional quotes on­line and set them as her phone wall­pa­per.</p>
    <p>She also wrote the ben­e­fits of ex­er­cise on pieces of pa­per and placed them on her desk as a re­minder to work on her goals.</p>
    <p>Ms Chen said it helps to think of the re­ward you may get from the habit. “This can in­crease in­trin­sic mo­ti­va­tion and link the be­hav­iour to a higher pur­pose or an important per­sonal value, such as link­ing ex­er­cise to how he or she could be fit enough to pro­vide for the fam­ily, for some­one who val­ues fam­ily and re­spon­si­bil­ity.”</p>
    <p>You can also re­duce the ob­sta­cles to prac­tis­ing the good habit, she added. For ex­am­ple, get your run­ning shoes or sports at­tire ready the night be­fore if you plan to jog the next morn­ing, she said.</p>
    <p>Another way is to make goals that are smart – spe­cific, mea­sur­able, at­tain­able, rel­e­vant and time­based.</p>
    <p>“These tar­get a spe­cific area, en­sure progress is mea­sur­able, make sure the goal is reach­able and is some­thing that can be worked upon within a suit­able time frame,” said Mr Soh.</p>
    <p>Happy set­ting New Year’s res­o­lu­tions for 2021.</p>
