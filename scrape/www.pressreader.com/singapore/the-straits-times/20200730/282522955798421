    <p>Right now, it is pretty dif­fer­ent from what came be­fore. It could be great, or it could ruin my ca­reer. But it will be fun.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>SINGER-SONG­WRITER BEN­JAMIN KHENG</p>
    <p>(above) on plans to re­lease more new mu­sic this year</p>
    <p>Among the four mem­bers of Sin­ga­pore pop band The Sam Wil­lows, singer-song­writer Ben­jamin Kheng was the last to re­lease solo mu­sic.</p>
    <p>The 29-year-old’s de­but EP, A Sea That Never Stops, was launched last month and comes more than six months af­ter his first solo sin­gle, Wicked, in Novem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>The rest of the group – his younger sis­ter Narelle, Jonathan Chua and San­dra Ri­ley Tang – made their solo de­buts ear­lier last year.</p>
    <p>The rea­son for the de­lay, he ex­plains, was that he took a year­long sab­bat­i­cal from mu­sic.</p>
    <p>Kheng spent time writ­ing and act­ing in on­line sketch com­edy se­ries The BenZi Project (2018 to present) with co­me­dian Hirzi Zulk­i­flie.</p>
    <p>The mu­si­cian has also acted in theatre pro­duc­tions such as 2014’s Ah Boys To Men: The Mu­si­cal, movies such as Dick Lee’s 2017 mu­si­cal film Won­der Boy, and tele­vi­sion shows such as 2018 sit­com FAM!.</p>
    <p>He also took the time to learn how to use TikTok.</p>
    <p>“I just needed a solid break from mu­sic for a while and to learn to fall in love with it again,” he says.</p>
    <p>Fans who are fa­mil­iar with The Sam Wil­lows might find the mu­sic on Kheng’s EP very dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>Tap­ping i nto gen­res such as gospel, rock and mu­si­cals, Kheng says it was not a con­scious de­ci­sion to move away from the band’s pop sounds.</p>
    <p>“I never made a note that said ‘don’t be The Sam Wil­lows’, but I needed to make mu­sic that was a truer re­flec­tion of who I was,” he says.</p>
    <p>“You’ll still hear hints of early Wil­lows in­flu­ences. Mu­sic has always been a com­mu­nal thing for me and that’s why these tracks are full of guest vo­cals.”</p>
    <p>The track Wicked, for ex­am­ple, fea­tures Tang and fel­low home­grown singers such as Dru Chen and Ethel Yap.</p>
    <p>Some songs, like Make Do, are deeply per­sonal.</p>
    <p>“The cho­rus for Make Do was ini­tially writ­ten as a mother’s lul­laby to her child, so that one’s a lit­tle closer to my heart,” says the for­mer na­tional youth swim­mer, whose mother died of breast can­cer when he was 12.</p>
    <p>The Sam Wil­lows, formed in 2011, have re­leased a self-ti­tled EP (2012) and two al­bums, Take Heart (2015) and I Know, But Where (2018), and their mu­sic has topped the lo­cal iTunes mu­sic charts.</p>
    <p>Be­sides head­lin­ing lo­cal venues such as The Coli­seum at Re­sorts World Sen­tosa, they also toured coun­tries such as the United States and South Korea.</p>
    <p>The quar­tet went on hia­tus last year and have been busy with their solo ca­reers. There are no plans to re­unite, Kheng says, but they are always in touch.</p>
    <p>“We’re still in a bunch of group chats and hang out once in a while. We mostly just send memes to one an­other.”</p>
    <p>With the pan­demic putting a stop to live shows, Kheng con­sid­ers him­self for­tu­nate to be able to turn to on­line stream­ing for both his mu­sic and com­edy se­ries.</p>
    <p>He has been in­volved in sev­eral high-pro­file on­line con­certs, in­clud­ing the fund-raiser ChildAid 2020 – Vir­tu­ally Yours, or­gan­ised by The Straits Times and The Busi­ness Times ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>“You have to pick up a cou­ple of new skills, like set­ting up a proper home stu­dio for live stream­ing, but it could be worse,” he says.</p>
    <p>Still, noth­ing beats the per­sonal touch of per­form­ing in front of an au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>“It’s a bit like hav­ing to see your lover through a dig­i­tal screen for months,” he says of stream­ing gigs. “I miss live shows. It’s not as fun on­line.”</p>
    <p>Yes, he re­gards both mu­sic and act­ing as his “chil­dren”.</p>
    <p>When asked if he is spend­ing more time with one or the other, he replies: “I love both my chil­dren equally, as all par­ents should. But I’ve got a new favourite child and her name is ‘yoga lessons with the fi­ancee’.”</p>
    <p>In March, he an­nounced on Instagram that he had pro­posed to ac­tress and ra­dio DJ Naomi Yeo while they were on hol­i­day in New Zealand.</p>
    <p>Be­sides sketch com­edy, Kheng also plans to re­lease more new mu­sic this year, although it will be dif­fer­ent from his de­but EP’s.</p>
    <p>“Right now, it is pretty dif­fer­ent from what came be­fore,” he hints. “It could be great, or it could ruin my ca­reer. But it will be fun.”</p>
    <p>In Naked An­drea Project’s much smaller set­ting, I feel more vul­ner­a­ble and ex­posed, as if I was naked mu­si­cally. There is im­me­di­ately a closer, more in­ti­mate con­nec­tion be­tween per­former and au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>NAKED AN­DREA PROJECT LEADER CUI YI­HAO</p>
    <p>on the group’s name. He spent most of his ca­reer play­ing in large groups</p>
    <p>Trum­pet player and leader of jazz fu­sion group Naked An­drea Project, Cui Yi­hao, of­ten gets asked about the group’s name.</p>
    <p>An­drea, the 22-year-old re­veals, is his stage name.</p>
    <p>As for the “naked” part, the clas­si­cal mu­si­cian says it was in­spired by how he felt when he formed the group in 2018. The project-based band have a fluid line-up.</p>
    <p>“I had spent most of my mu­si­cal ca­reer play­ing in large groups, es­pe­cially or­ches­tras. I would be sit­ting in the back row of 80 mu­si­cians, play­ing to an au­di­ence I couldn’t see,” says the re­cent grad­u­ate of the Yong Siew Toh Con­ser­va­tory of Mu­sic.</p>
    <p>“In Naked An­drea Project’s much smaller set­ting, I feel more vul­ner­a­ble and ex­posed, as if I was naked mu­si­cally. There is im­me­di­ately a closer, more in­ti­mate con­nec­tion be­tween per­former and au­di­ence; I wanted to build on it with my mu­sic.”</p>
    <p>In May, the band re­leased their de­but EP, In New Light. The mu­si­cians who played on it are Greg Lyons on sax­o­phone, Er­win Tan on trom­bone, Mark Yeo on flute, Xavier Lim on pi­ano, Eu­gene Chew on bass and An­son Koh on drums.</p>
    <p>Cui was in his third year at Yong Siew Toh, a school at the Na­tional</p>
    <p>Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS), when he de­cided to change his ma­jor from clas­si­cal trum­pet per­for­mance to the newly in­tro­duced Mu­sic, Col­lab­o­ra­tion & Pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>More than just an aca­demic ex­er­cise, form­ing Naked An­drea Project al­lowed him to delve into non­clas­si­cal mu­sic.</p>
    <p>The group started out per­form­ing in venues around NUS as well as the Es­planade.</p>
    <p>The on­set of the pan­demic ear­lier this year forced them to has­ten their record­ing for the EP – all four in­stru­men­tal songs were recorded in one af­ter­noon in March, be­fore the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Cui says the rush re­sulted i n plenty of mis­takes and im­per­fec­tions, which turned out to be a bless­ing in dis­guise.</p>
    <p>“I re­alised this was not nec­es­sar­ily a bad thing. The essence of im­pro­vi­sa­tion and jazz is not in per­fec­tion, but in live com­mu­ni­ca­tion and cre­ation,” he ex­plains.</p>
    <p>“In a time when live per­for­mances have been can­celled, this is the clos­est thing to a live per­for­mance I could have re­leased.”</p>
    <p>He was “blown away” by the con­cept of im­pro­vi­sa­tion when he dis­cov­ered jazz.</p>
    <p>“Lo­cally speak­ing, most horn play­ers, such as trum­peters, trom­bon­ists and flautists, are stuck in the con­fines of clas­si­cal mu­sic. I want to show there can be so much more to play­ing a wind in­stru­ment.”</p>
    <p>He wants to in­spire the younger gen­er­a­tion of mu­si­cians to ex­plore all facets of mu­sic and not re­strict them­selves to a sin­gle genre.</p>
    <p>“It makes lit­tle sense to me that art is ul­ti­mately about cre­ation, yet a large seg­ment of our lo­cal mu­sic ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem en­cour­ages mind­less copy­ing and repli­ca­tion with lit­tle av­enue for cre­ativ­ity and im­pro­vi­sa­tion.”</p>
    <p>Cui has plans to move to Va­len­cia, Spain, and even­tu­ally to Bos­ton, in the United States, to fur­ther his mu­sic ed­u­ca­tion at the ac­claimed Berklee Col­lege of Mu­sic, which has cam­puses in both cities.</p>
    <p>“I’m look­ing for­ward to go­ing in­ter­na­tional with Naked An­drea Project, es­pe­cially since there will be a lot more per­for­mance op­por­tu­ni­ties overseas,” he says.</p>
    <p>“I’d like to record an al­bum or two in my time overseas and re­turn to Sin­ga­pore at a much higher cal­i­bre. Ul­ti­mately, I’d like to tour fre­quently and bring my mu­sic across Asia.”</p>
