    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin called off last night’s highly an­tic­i­pated launch of his Perikatan Na­sional (PN) in Sabah, af­ter re­cently ex­pe­ri­enc­ing sev­eral set­backs to for­mal­is­ing Malaysia’s new­est po­lit­i­cal al­liance.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to the Malaysian In­dian Con­gress’ (MIC) sud­den pull­out ear­lier last week, the fail­ure to sign up sev­eral Sabah-based par­ties re­sulted in the post­pone­ment of the launch, The Sun­day Times has learnt.</p>
    <p>The Premier is vis­it­ing Sabah ahead of polls on Sept 26 to elect a new govern­ment for Malaysia’s eastern­most state.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia wants al­lies in Sabah to con­test un­der a new PN logo that he un­veiled at a meet­ing with party lead­ers in the state yes­ter­day morn­ing, but ne­go­ti­a­tions over the cam­paign which be­gins in a fort­night have not pro­gressed quickly enough.</p>
    <p>Al­though the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion is called PN, it is an un­of­fi­cial pact made up of the Umno-led</p>
    <p>Barisan Na­sional (BN), which was de­feated at the 2018 Gen­eral Elec­tion, the Gabun­gan Parti Sarawak (GPS), which con­trols Malaysia’s largest state, as well as Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS) and sev­eral in­de­pen­dent par­ties in Sabah.</p>
    <p>Par­ties that had of­fi­cially signed up to PN in­clude Parti Sol­i­dar­iti Tanah Airku Rakyat Sabah, as well as the Is­lamist PAS and MIC, al­though the lat­ter back­tracked this week say­ing it had done so be­liev­ing the rest of BN would do the same.</p>
    <p>The once dom­i­nant Umno prefers to con­test un­der its decades­old BN flag in a tus­sle for lever­age ever since Mr Muhyid­din was sworn in on March 1.</p>
    <p>That was af­ter most of his Ber­satu, as well as sup­port­ers of former Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat deputy pres­i­dent Azmin Ali, de­fected from the then Pakatan Hara­pan govern­ment.</p>
    <p>“I think our top lead­ers don’t have a clue how to move for­ward. Too com­pli­cated,” said a rul­ing coali­tion of­fi­cial, who added that the dif­fer­ent in­ter­ests that need to be re­solved within PN may cause po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity to be elusive even af­ter snap polls.</p>
    <p>Umno and PAS have called for fresh elec­tions. Mr Muhyid­din has also told Ber­satu grass­roots that he wants to gain a per­sonal and stronger man­date de­spite the cur­rent par­lia­men­tary term end­ing only in late 2023, hav­ing fought hard to keep hold of his ra­zor-thin ma­jor­ity of the 222-strong leg­is­la­ture.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times had re­ported on Tues­day that last week­end’s for­mal sign­ing up of Se­nior Eco­nomic Min­is­ter Azmin into Ber­satu was the last ma­jor step be­fore un­veil­ing the PN pact, which has faced re­sis­tance from Umno, the govern­ment’s largest com­po­nent.</p>
    <p>The move came in con­cert with open­ing up Ber­satu to non-bu­mi­put­era. The term “bu­mi­put­era” is used to col­lec­tively re­fer to the Malay ma­jor­ity and Malaysia’s in­dige­nous tribes.</p>
    <p>GPS, made up of par­ties that broke away from BN af­ter the 2018 de­feat, has main­tained it will use its own logo but is sup­port­ive of PN.</p>
    <p>In Sabah, Mr Muhyid­din ad­dressed civil ser­vants and ex­pressed dis­ap­point­ment that “Sabah is not aligned with us”, since the state would stand to ben­e­fit from co­op­er­a­tion with the fed­eral govern­ment.</p>
    <p>“Can you imag­ine? This is not pol­i­tics, it’s re­al­ity... a bit of cam­paign­ing but not re­ally, this is the re­al­ity,” he said.</p>
    <p>Al­though the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion is called Perikatan Na­sional, it is an un­of­fi­cial pact made up of the Umno-led Barisan Na­sional, which was de­feated at the 2018 Gen­eral Elec­tion, the Gabun­gan Parti Sarawak, which con­trols Malaysia’s largest state, as well as Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia and sev­eral in­de­pen­dent par­ties in Sabah.</p>
