    <p>Loot boxes are lu­cra­tive for game de­vel­op­ers but their use is akin to gam­bling, say ex­perts and those in the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The boxes are vir­tual goodie bags that give play­ers ran­dom in-game re­wards, and can be pur­chased ei­ther with cur­ren­cies in the game or in­di­rectly with real cash.</p>
    <p>Coun­sel­lors and cy­ber well­ness ex­perts have said loot boxes are linked to prob­lem gam­bling be­cause of the “risk-re­ward fac­tor” and “rush” in­her­ent in their mech­a­nisms.</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore cur­rently has no laws against loot boxes, they have been banned by some coun­tries like Bel­gium. The Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion said in Oc­to­ber that pri­mary and sec­ondary school stu­dents here may be taught about the ills of loot boxes.</p>
    <p>De­spite the con­tro­versy, in­dus­try ex­perts say game de­vel­op­ers have con­tin­ued to in­clude them for prof­itabil­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Yasser Is­mail, who runs a pro­fes­sional Fifa es­ports team and is a mem­ber of the eS­ports & Gam­ing Interest Group at the In­ter­ac­tive Ad­ver­tis­ing Bureau South-east Asia and In­dia, said: “The mi­cro­trans­ac­tions might not be large amounts, but they add up to large sums if games have enough pop­u­lar­ity.”</p>
    <p>The as­so­ciate vice-pres­i­dent of strat­egy for Asi­aPa­cific at me­dia agency Essence added: “From a gamer’s per­spec­tive, these loot box pur­chases are at­trac­tive es­pe­cially if they are per­for­mance-en­hanc­ing. Gamers al­ways want to be the best they can pos­si­bly be, and if pay­ing these amounts makes them bet­ter play­ers and gives them an eas­ier route, they’re will­ing to do it.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lai Tuck Weng, founder of mar­ket­ing con­sul­tancy Edge Dig­i­tal, which spe­cialises in gam­ing, tech­nol­ogy and mo­bile apps, agreed, say­ing that with the freemium model used in many of these games, game de­vel­op­ers have found ways to “con­vert” play­ers who are play­ing for free to pay­ing ones.</p>
    <p>He added that de­vel­op­ers ride on psy­cho­log­i­cal meth­ods to urge play­ers to spend, es­pe­cially when some games in­clude player-ver­sus-player el­e­ments to in­crease com­pet­i­tive­ness, and sell per­for­mance-en­hanc­ing items with­out which play­ers might not be able to win games.</p>
    <p>Mr Al­lan Si­mon­sen, co-founder and tech­ni­cal di­rec­tor at Boomzap En­ter­tain­ment as well as In­ter­na­tional Game De­vel­op­ers As­so­ci­a­tion Sin­ga­pore Chap­ter co­or­di­na­tor, said de­vel­op­ers con­tinue to use loot boxes in their games de­spite the con­tro­ver­sies sim­ply be­cause of the money they bring in.</p>
    <p>“Free-to-play games his­tor­i­cally mon­e­tise ei­ther plea­sure or pain. Loot boxes are en­tirely for plea­sure, since the en­tire point is to mon­e­tise the joy of open­ing a sur­prise,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Cathy Que, founder of two gam­ing-re­lated com­pa­nies, YDY CG and Vec­tor Gems Tech, said she felt it was im­por­tant for par­ents to keep abreast of gam­ing is­sues.</p>
    <p>The mother of two teenagers said stop­ping chil­dren from play­ing games may cause them to feel left out so­cially.</p>
    <p>In­stead, she said, reg­u­lat­ing a child’s game time and set­ting a bud­get for in-game pur­chases is a bet­ter ap­proach, adding that chil­dren may be de­terred from pur­chas­ing loot boxes them­selves af­ter mul­ti­ple failed at­tempts to get valu­able items from them.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Games As­so­ci­a­tion, founded in August last year to act as a trade as­so­ci­a­tion for the lo­cal games in­dus­try, said that while there are cur­rently no lo­cal reg­u­la­tions of game as­pects with an el­e­ment of chance, it be­lieves that “when it comes to public ed­u­ca­tion on cy­ber well­ness and responsibl­e gam­ing, the ecosys­tem will need to work to­gether, from the in­di­vid­ual level to pri­vate sec­tor and if need be, the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties”.</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore cur­rently has no laws against loot boxes, they have been banned by some coun­tries like Bel­gium.</p>
