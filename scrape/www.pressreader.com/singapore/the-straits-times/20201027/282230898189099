    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Pa­trick Cant­lay has al­ways been one to fly un­der the radar.</p>
    <p>In 2011, he was ranked the topranked am­a­teur golfer in the world, spend­ing a then record 55 weeks on top, but was still over­shad­owed by his more high-pro­file peers like Xan­der Schauf­fele, Jon Rahm and Justin Thomas.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, Cant­lay clinched just his third PGA Tour vic­tory since turn­ing pro in 2012, claim­ing a oneshot win at the Zozo Cham­pi­onship in Thou­sand Oaks, Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old staged a back­nine charge to speed past world No. 2 Rahm and third-ranked Thomas, en­sur­ing his re­turn to the top 10 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The new world No. 9 carded a fi­nal-round seven-un­der 65 at the Sher­wood Coun­try Club to top the leader­board on 23-un­der 265.</p>
    <p>His round in­cluded a ca­reer-high nine birdies, four of those com­ing over a five hole stretch from the 11th on the back nine to fend off Spain’s Rahm (68) and fel­low Amer­i­can Thomas (69) – both of whom ended the day joint-sec­ond.</p>
    <p>Cant­lay fin­ished the week with just two bo­geys, com­ing dur­ing the fi­nal round and in­clud­ing one at the 16th that cut his ad­van­tage to a sin­gle stroke. It nearly opened the door for Rahm to force a play-off if he birdied the fi­nal hole but his 19-foot at­tempt stopped just short of the cup.</p>
    <p>On his first vic­tory since the Me­mo­rial in June last year, Cant­lay, a na­tive Cal­i­for­nian, said: “It means a lot. I’m re­ally happy to have won this week. I was hit­ting a lot of good shots. I re­ally felt com­fort­able with my swing.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been play­ing re­ally well the last lit­tle stretch. I just hadn’t put it to­gether four days in a row. This week was dif­fer­ent. It was nice to get off to a good start. It went pretty well.”</p>
    <p>“It’s re­ally great to win at home. I look for­ward to hope­fully win­ning at Riviera (next year), and any time you win close to home it just feels a lit­tle sweeter.</p>
    <p>“I felt com­fort­able all week. I like this cloudy Cal­i­for­nia weather, I’m used to it, it’s what I grew up with. It was just a nice week.”</p>
    <p>The ques­tion now is whether he can find con­sis­tency to his game and start chal­leng­ing for the big­gest hon­ours, start­ing with next month’s Masters.</p>
    <p>His best fin­ish at Au­gusta was tied for ninth last year, while his best re­sult at a Ma­jor was joint­third at last year’s PGA Cham­pi­onship but Cant­lay is hope­ful he can take the same route as one of his idols, Tiger Woods.</p>
    <p>The 15-time Ma­jor cham­pion, back in ac­tion for the first time since miss­ing the cut at the US Open, saw his Zozo ti­tle de­fence go up in smoke af­ter the first round and he closed out a frus­trat­ing week with a 74, end­ing 22 strokes be­hind the win­ner.</p>
    <p>The for­mer world No. 1 said the only con­so­la­tion he took away af­ter what is likely to be his fi­nal warmup event be­fore his Masters de­fence was that he “rolled it great”.</p>
    <p>Cant­lay, how­ever, feels he is mov­ing into con­tention at Au­gusta, say­ing: “I was able to win one of the tour­na­ments Tiger won last year.</p>
    <p>“So now I’m just go­ing to go try and win the other event that Tiger won last year.”</p>
