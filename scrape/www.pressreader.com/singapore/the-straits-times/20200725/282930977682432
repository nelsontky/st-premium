    <p>• Fol­low­ing a law­suit against her by her son, the mother of late K-pop star Goo Hara (left) has come out to give her side of the story.</p>
    <p>The mother ap­peared on Wed­nes­day on broad­caster JTBC’s Spot­light pro­gramme, which looked at the dis­pute over who gets to in­herit the late singer’s as­sets.</p>
    <p>Goo, 28, was found dead at home in Novem­ber last year, l eav­ing be­hind a note filled re­port­edly with pes­simistic thoughts.</p>
    <p>On the pro­gramme, her mother, whose face was not shown, ex­plained why she had walked out on her chil­dren when they were young, South Korean pop cul­ture web­site Soompi re­ported.</p>
    <p>She said: “What kind of par­ent doesn’t want to raise her child?</p>
    <p>“How­ever, I had my own cir­cum­stance. In my sit­u­a­tion with­out a job, leav­ing with only one bag, even though I wanted to raise them, I found my­self in a sit­u­a­tion where I couldn’t, so I didn’t.”</p>
    <p>Goo and her brother Ho-in were aban­doned by their di­vorced par­ents when they were nine and 11 re­spec­tively and were cared for by rel­a­tives.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the death of Goo, her par­ents each re­ceived half of her as­sets in ac­cor­dance with South Korea’s Civil Act.</p>
    <p>Her father gave his half to Ho-in, while her mother still main­tains her right over her half de­spite fail­ing to ful­fil her parental du­ties.</p>
    <p>Re­gard­ing her de­ci­sion to ap­point lawyers to help her get a share of her daugh­ter’s es­tate, Goo’s mother said: “I told the lawyers to take care of it on their own. My daugh­ter had died, what kind of in­her­i­tance or money could have been im­por­tant?</p>
    <p>“I don’t even know now how it worked out. I don’t know any­thing. I don’t even know what the amount of money is. Don’t keep ask­ing ques­tions. This is hard.”</p>
    <p>Her son has since filed a law­suit against her, say­ing she has no right to the in­her­i­tance.</p>
    <p>He has also pe­ti­tioned for a Goo Hara Act to change the coun­try’s in­her­i­tance law to pre­vent a par­ent’s claim on his chil­dren’s as­sets if he had ne­glected parental du­ties.</p>
