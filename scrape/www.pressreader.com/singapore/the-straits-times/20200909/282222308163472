    <p>•</p>
    <p>Ill-timed bets on ris­ing de­mand have Exxon­Mo­bil fac­ing a short­fall of about US$48 bil­lion (S$65.7 bil­lion) un­til the end of next year, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally and Wall Street es­ti­mates, a sit­u­a­tion that will re­quire the top United States oil com­pany to make deep cuts to its staff and projects.</p>
    <p>Wall Street in­vestors are even start­ing to worry about the once­sacro­sanct div­i­dend at Exxon, which in the 20th cen­tury be­came the world’s most valu­able com­pany us­ing global scale, re­lent­less ex­pan­sion and strict fi­nan­cial con­trols.</p>
    <p>Exxon weath­ered a se­ries of set­backs last decade, and un­der chief ex­ec­u­tive Dar­ren Woods sought to re­turn to its past promi­nence with big bets on US shale oil­fields, pipe­lines and global refin­ing and plas­tics. It also bet big on off­shore Guyana, where it dis­cov­ered up to eight bil­lion bar­rels of oil – six years of pro­duc­tion, at its cur­rent rate.</p>
    <p>But Exxon’s abil­ity to fi­nance that global ex­pan­sion is no longer as­sured. This year, the com­pany bor­rowed US$23 bil­lion to pay its bills, nearly dou­bling its out­stand­ing debt. In July, it posted its first back-to-back quar­terly losses. It faces a full-year US$1.86 bil­lion loss, ac­cord­ing to Refini­tiv, ex­clud­ing as­set sales or write-downs.</p>
    <p>The loom­ing short­fall of about US$48 bil­lion was cal­cu­lated us­ing cash from op­er­a­tions, com­mit­ments to share­holder pay­outs and costs of the mas­sive ex­pan­sion pro­gramme Exxon had planned.</p>
    <p>Now the com­pany is em­bark­ing on a world­wide re­view of where it can cut ex­penses, and an­a­lysts be­lieve the once-un­think­able div­i­dend cut has grown more likely.</p>
    <p>This year’s sharp drop in oil de­mand and pric­ing has shred­ded Mr Woods’ plan to spend at least US$30 bil­lion a year up to the end of 2025 to re­vive pro­duc­tion and earn­ings by ex­pand­ing oil pro­cess­ing, chem­i­cals and pro­duc­tion, and by tak­ing a com­mand­ing role in US shale and liq­ue­fied nat­u­ral gas, mar</p>
    <p>kets that then looked promis­ing.</p>
    <p>In­stead, he must pre­pare Exxon to op­er­ate in a world of weaker de­mand for its oil, gas and plas­tics.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has been dropped from the Dow Jones in­dex of top US in­dus­trial com­pa­nies af­ter 92 years.</p>
    <p>It is ex­pos­ing up to 10 per cent of US staff to harsh re­views that could push thou­sands out of the com­pany, and is tak­ing away lav­ish re­tire­ment ben­e­fits that had ca­reer em­ploy­ees stay­ing 30 years on av­er­age.</p>
    <p>Exxon de­clined to make an ex­ec­u­tive avail­able for an in­ter­view, and a</p>
    <p>spokesman said de­tails of cost cuts would be dis­closed early next year.</p>
    <p>“We re­main com­mit­ted to our capital al­lo­ca­tion pri­or­i­ties – investing in in­dus­try ad­van­taged projects, pay­ing a re­li­able and grow­ing div­i­dend, and main­tain­ing a strong bal­ance sheet,” said spokesman Casey Nor­ton.</p>
    <p>A re­view of projects now un­der way aims to “max­imise ef­fi­ciency and cap­ture ad­di­tional cost sav­ings to put us in the strong­est po­si­tion” as en­ergy mar­kets im­prove, he said.</p>
    <p>Oil prices have dropped 35 per</p>
    <p>cent from the start of this year as de­mand col­lapsed dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic. BP, Royal Dutch Shell, To­tal, Rep­sol and oth­ers have cut bil­lions of dol­lars off the value of their oil and gas prop­er­ties, some­thing Exxon has yet to do.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean majors are also adding re­new­able en­ergy and elec­tric­ity to their port­fo­lios, a hedge against per­ma­nently re­duced oil and gas de­mand. BP plans by 2030 to re­duce its fos­sil fuel pro­duc­tion by 40 per cent.</p>
    <p>Exxon’s cash from op­er­a­tions –</p>
    <p>es­ti­mated at about US$17.4 bil­lion this year – is US$20 bil­lion below the funds needed for this year’s in­vest­ment plan and share­holder div­i­dend, a Reuters anal­y­sis showed.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s stock price closed last Fri­day at US$39.08, off 56 per cent since Mr Woods be­came CEO.</p>
    <p>Exxon must cut its div­i­dend if the share price re­mains de­pressed, said Mr Mark Stoeckle, se­nior port­fo­lio man­ager at Adams Funds. “Some­thing has to give. Wher­ever the give comes, (it) hurts man­age­ment cred­i­bil­ity,” he said.</p>
