    <p>As In­dia over­hauls its ed­u­ca­tion policy after more than three decades, heated de­bates have erupted over the lan­guage in which chil­dren will be taught in their early years of school­ing.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Ed­u­ca­tion Policy (NEP), which was ap­proved last month, rec­om­mends that “wher­ever pos­si­ble”, chil­dren should be taught in the mother tongue or lo­cal/re­gional lan­guage un­til at least Grade 5 and prefer­ably till Grade 8 in el­e­men­tary school.</p>
    <p>The lan­guage choice is based on sev­eral stud­ies that said chil­dren learn bet­ter when taught in the mother tongue or the lan­guage in which they think, said ed­u­ca­tion­ist Leena Chan­dran Wa­dia, who worked on the draft policy.</p>
    <p>“If a child is think­ing in a lan­guage (re­gional or lo­cal)... they are more cre­ative (when taught in that lan­guage). If they have flu­ency, they de­velop bet­ter and will be able to learn science or other sub­jects in that lan­guage. What this policy has done is to say that states should be open to al­low­ing gov­ern­ment schools to teach in mul­ti­ple lan­guages. There is no com­pul­sion to study a cer­tain lan­guage,” said Ms Wa­dia, se­nior fel­low at Ob­server Re­search Foun­da­tion in Mum­bai.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause of the fo­cus on ed­u­ca­tion in English, what is hap­pen­ing to­day is that stu­dents are not de­vel­op­ing foun­da­tional lit­er­acy and nu­mer­i­cal skills. And then they are piled on with more ma­te­rial in English and as a re­sult kids (mainly from gov­ern­ment schools and poorer back­grounds) were start­ing to drop out,” she said.</p>
    <p>But the pro­posed lan­guage change has trig­gered in­tense de­bates, di­vid­ing the coun­try be­tween those who sup­port English­language ed­u­ca­tion and those who be­lieve In­dian lan­guages are be­ing ne­glected.</p>
    <p>In In­dia, English-medium ed­u­ca­tion is seen to be as­pi­ra­tional, pop­u­larly sought after by most par­ents, in­clud­ing the poor­est.</p>
    <p>But English crit­ics call the fo­cus on English a colo­nial hang­over and main­tain it is a dis­ad­van­tage for chil­dren from smaller vil­lages and</p>
    <p>English is the in­ter­na­tional lin­gua franca. In­dia is unity in di­ver­sity. We have so many lan­guages. Un­of­fi­cially, we have hun­dreds of lan­guages. English lan­guage unites us. If chil­dren are ex­posed to English at a later stage, there will be dis­con­ti­nu­ity. We can’t go by the feel­ing of pa­tri­o­tism in ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Tamil Nadu will never al­low the fed­eral gov­ern­ment’s three-lan­guage policy. The state will con­tinue with its dual-lan­guage policy of Tamil and English. smaller ci­ties where the qual­ity of English lan­guage teach­ing is poor and lan­guage flu­ency is a chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Na­tion­al­ists go as far as to call English the lan­guage of the lib­eral elite, used to dis­crim­i­nate against those who are not flu­ent in English.</p>
    <p>Among those who sup­port In­dian lan­guages is the Rashtriya Swayam­se­vak Sangh, a Hindu na­tion­al­ist so­cial out­fit which is the ide­o­log­i­cal back­bone of the rul­ing Bharatiya Janata Party.</p>
    <p>Those in favour of English said the lan­guage has given In­dian chil­dren an edge in an era of glob­al­i­sa­tion, cit­ing the Chi­nese em­pha­sis on teach­ing English, and be­lieve the thrust on In­dian lan­guages mir­rors a rise in na­tion­al­is­tic ten­den­cies.</p>
    <p>“English is the in­ter­na­tional lin­gua franca. In­dia is unity in di­ver­sity. We have so many lan­guages. Un­of­fi­cially, we have hun­dreds of lan­guages. English lan­guage unites us,” said Dr Boora Narsaiah Goud, a former MP from the south­ern state of Te­len­gana.</p>
    <p>“If chil­dren are ex­posed to English at a later stage, there will be dis­con­ti­nu­ity. We can’t go by the feel­ing of pa­tri­o­tism in ed­u­ca­tion.”</p>
    <p>In­dia is a coun­try of hun­dreds of lan­guages and di­alects di­vided along lin­guis­tic lines.</p>
    <p>The In­dian Con­sti­tu­tion recog­nises 22 ma­jor lan­guages, in­clud­ing Hindi – a pop­u­lar medium of in­struc­tion in north­ern and cen­tral In­dia.</p>
    <p>Still, in the south­ern state of Tamil Nadu, there is also po­lit­i­cal op­po­si­tion to the NEP rec­om­men­da­tion that three lan­guages, in­stead of two, should be taught in the early years.</p>
    <p>Two of the three lan­guages have to be In­dian, trig­ger­ing con­cern that this will re­sult in more wide­spread teach­ing of Hindi in Tamil Nadu, where Hindi is con­sid­ered a north In­dian lan­guage, and di­lute the im­por­tance of Tamil.</p>
    <p>“Tamil Nadu will never al­low the fed­eral gov­ern­ment’s three-lan­guage policy. The state will con­tinue with its dual-lan­guage policy of Tamil and English,” said Tamil Nadu Chief Min­is­ter Edappadi K. Palaniswam­i.</p>
    <p>But the lan­guage de­bate is seen to be de­tract­ing from the real chal­lenge fac­ing the In­dian ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem: the qual­ity of teach­ers.</p>
    <p>The NEP pro­posed many changes be­yond lan­guage, in­clud­ing push­ing a more ap­pli­ca­tion-based ed­u­ca­tion by in­tro­duc­ing vo­ca­tional streams with in­tern­ships from Grade 6 and do­ing away with the rigid sep­a­ra­tion be­tween sci­ences and hu­man­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“In prin­ci­ple, this (NEP lan­guage policy) is a good move. How­ever, in prac­tice, there are very few teach­ers trained well enough who can carry out the task. This has to do with the gen­eral ne­glect of the teach­ing pro­fes­sion in In­dia,” said Pro­fes­sor San­jay Sri­vas­tava, a so­ci­ol­o­gist at the In­sti­tute of Eco­nomic Growth.</p>
    <p>“The first task should be bet­ter teacher train­ing and con­di­tions of work,” he added.</p>
