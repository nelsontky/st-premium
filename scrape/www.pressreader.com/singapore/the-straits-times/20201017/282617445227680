    <p>THE SHOW GOES ON: The coro­n­avirus pan­demic may not be over, but work has re­sumed for some celebri­ties with en­gage­ments in China, as the coun­try has man­aged to keep its Covid-19 cases un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>Brunei singer-ac­tor Wu Chun has been in­vited to a char­ity run in Suzhou, China, on Nov 1 and he left Brunei for China on Wed­nes­day to serve a two-week quar­an­tine be­fore start­ing work.</p>
    <p>Wu, 41, for­merly of Tai­wanese boy band Fahren­heit, posted on Weibo pho­tos of him­self in per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment (PPE) and look­ing sad while his wife and two chil­dren kissed him.</p>
    <p>“Words can never ex­press how much I miss you all,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>He also posted a photo of him­self in PPE at the air­port, with the cap­tion: “A day which re­quires strength and courage.”</p>
    <p>In another photo of him­self in a plane full of pas­sen­gers in PPE, he said: “I hope we can re­turn to nor­malcy next year”.</p>
    <p>He is mar­ried to Lin Liy­ing, also 41, and they have a daugh­ter, Neinei, 10, and son, Max, seven.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple and their chil­dren held a se­ries of birthday cel­e­bra­tions last week­end, as their birth­days fell on Oct 10 and 11.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Wu posted pho­tos of them cel­e­brat­ing their birth­days on the beach a day be­fore he left for China. He said: “The best thing about mem­o­ries is mak­ing them.”</p>
