    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans have to work hand in hand with the Gov­ern­ment to solve prob­lems and pur­sue fresh ideas to­gether, Min­is­ter for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Des­mond Lee said yes­ter­day. It is not about the Gov­ern­ment set­ting the agenda all the time, then seek­ing in­put from the pub­lic, he said.</p>
    <p>“In­stead, the com­mu­nity comes up with ideas and de­cides what they want to work on, while the Gov­ern­ment sup­ports them,” said Mr Lee, who is also Min­is­ter-in-charge of So­cial Ser­vices In­te­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>He cited the ex­am­ple of the Youth Men­tal Well-be­ing Net­work set up in Fe­bru­ary. It is open to any­one who wants to sign up, and more than 1,000 peo­ple have done so.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said the Gov­ern­ment gave the net­work space to shape its own agenda.</p>
    <p>“One par­tic­i­pant asked me what the Gov­ern­ment aimed to achieve through this net­work. I said that we did not want to pre­de­ter­mine where the net­work would go,” he added.</p>
    <p>There­fore, some par­tic­i­pants have stepped up and vol­un­teered to drive the process, and the net­work has crafted prob­lem state­ments and raised eight ar­eas of in­ter­est that they want to dive into, Mr Lee said.</p>
    <p>An­other ex­am­ple is Al­liances for Ac­tion – in­dus­try-led coali­tions in the eco­nomic do­main that aim to quickly de­velop and test new ideas of growth.</p>
    <p>One Al­liance for Ac­tion project on sup­ply chain dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion has or­gan­ised seven work­shops to en­gage nearly 50 par­ties across the sup­ply chain. In this case, the in­dus­try takes the lead with the Gov­ern­ment as an ac­tive part­ner, said Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>Since June, a new ac­tion net­work for the so­cial sec­tor – the Be­yond Covid-19 task force – has been formed, he added.</p>
    <p>The task force was born of a de­sire by the Na­tional Coun­cil of So­cial Ser­vice and so­cial ser­vice agen­cies to come to­gether and work on com­mon chal­lenges, and de­velop a so­cial sec­tor that can ef­fec­tively meet emerg­ing so­cial needs postCovid-19, he said.</p>
    <p>As more themes emerge from con­ver­sa­tions be­tween the Gov­ern­ment and Sin­ga­pore­ans, more ac­tion net­works can be formed in the months ahead, said Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>He called for all Sin­ga­pore­ans to be part of ef­forts to con­tinue build­ing to­wards a bet­ter Sin­ga­pore. One as­pect that will need col­lec­tive ac­tion is in build­ing a greener and more en­vi­ron­men­tally sus­tain­able Sin­ga­pore, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said: “It is an ex­is­ten­tial chal­lenge for us. There is no vac­cine for cli­mate change, and as an is­land city, we are es­pe­cially vul­ner­a­ble to its con­se­quences, such as ris­ing sea lev­els and in­creas­ing tem­per­a­tures.”</p>
    <p>That is why the coun­try is dou­bling down on ef­forts to be low-car­bon and cli­mate-re­silient, such as by plant­ing one mil­lion trees, mak­ing build­ings, towns and the trans­port net­work green, and push­ing for the use of more re­new­able en­ergy like so­lar power.</p>
    <p>“We need ev­ery­one to be part of this ef­fort – to re­duce the en­ergy we use, re­duce the waste we pro­duce and care col­lec­tively for our en­vi­ron­ment,” said Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>He added that the na­tion is en­ter­ing a pe­riod of great stress and un­pre­dictabil­ity, and Sin­ga­pore­ans are un­der­stand­ably con­cerned.</p>
    <p>“But we are start­ing from a po­si­tion of strength, learn­ing from our past ex­pe­ri­ences in fight­ing dis­ease out­breaks, draw­ing on fis­cal re­serves that we have built up over decades and gen­er­a­tions, and most im­por­tantly, stand­ing united in the face of chal­lenges and ad­ver­sity,” he said.</p>
    <p>“More than ever, in these times, we need all hands on deck to steady the ship. Ev­ery Sin­ga­porean can con­trib­ute in one way or an­other,” he added.</p>
    <p>He called on youth to con­trib­ute their en­ergy, ideas, cre­ativ­ity and will­ing­ness to chal­lenge the sta­tus quo in ar­eas such as cli­mate change, new ap­pli­ca­tions for dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy and help­ing the low­in­come and vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>For older Sin­ga­pore­ans, their deep ex­pe­ri­ence, wis­dom and fight­ing spirit will be needed, while en­ter­prises and work­ers have to be nim­ble to keep up with the changes and trans­for­ma­tions.</p>
    <p>Com­mu­nity part­ners, with their ex­ten­sive net­works, can be first re­spon­ders who can iden­tify and be­friend those fac­ing chal­lenges, with their en­thu­si­asm, spirit and un­der­stand­ing of the ground, said Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore To­gether is one of the ral­ly­ing cries and the spirit that will guide us through this cri­sis: Our com­mit­ment to leave no one be­hind, mak­ing space for dif­fer­ing views and do­ing our part.”</p>
    <p>We are start­ing from a po­si­tion of strength, learn­ing from our past ex­pe­ri­ences in fight­ing dis­ease out­breaks, draw­ing on fis­cal re­serves that we have built up over decades and gen­er­a­tions, and most im­por­tantly, stand­ing united in the face of chal­lenges and ad­ver­sity.</p>
