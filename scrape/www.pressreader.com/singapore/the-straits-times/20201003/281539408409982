    <p>United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump an­nounced yes­ter­day that he and his wife Me­la­nia had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19. The Pres­i­dent and First Lady are well and plan to re­main at home dur­ing their con­va­les­cence, with Mr Trump ex­pected to con­tinue car­ry­ing out his du­ties.</p>
    <p>The United States pres­i­den­tial con­test was thrown into dis­ar­ray, just a month from elec­tion day, when Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump an­nounced yes­ter­day that he and his wife Me­la­nia Trump had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent and First Lady are well and plan to re­main at home in the White House dur­ing their con­va­les­cence, with Mr Trump ex­pected to con­tinue car­ry­ing out his du­ties with­out dis­rup­tion while re­cov­er­ing, the Pres­i­dent’s physi­cian Sean Con­ley said in a me­moran­dum. The Trumps’ 14-year-old son Bar­ron tested neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den, his wife Jill and his run­ning mate Ka­mala Har­ris also tested neg­a­tive yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent does have mild symp­toms of the virus but re­mains “very en­er­getic”, White House Chief of Staff Mark Mead­ows told re­porters.</p>
    <p>Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence, who is next in the pres­i­den­tial line of suc­ces­sion should Mr Trump be med­i­cally in­ca­pac­i­tated, tested neg­a­tive to­gether with his wife Karen yes­ter­day morn­ing, his press sec­re­tary said.</p>
    <p>While the im­pact of the di­ag­no­sis on t he race is uncer­tain, Mr Trump’s quar­an­tine forces him off the cam­paign trail for now, a blow to his ef­forts to drum up sup­port at in-per­son events at a time when he is trail­ing Mr Bi­den by seven points na­tion­ally.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump was due to meet Mr Bi­den on Oct 15 in Mi­ami, Florida, and on Oct 22 in Nashville, Ten­nessee, for the sec­ond and third pres­i­den­tial de­bates, which are now up in the air.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s al­lies sought to project the im­age of business as usual, with Se­nate Ma­jor­ity Leader Mitch McCon­nell say­ing the Se­nate would con­tinue “full steam ahead” with the nom­i­na­tion of Judge Amy Coney Bar­rett to the Supreme Court.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing yes­ter­day, Mr Bi­den, who de­bated Mr Trump at an in­door venue in Cleve­land, Ohio, on Tues­day, said on Twit­ter: “Jill and I send our thoughts to Pres­i­dent Trump and First Lady Me­la­nia Trump for a swift re­cov­ery. We will con­tinue to pray for the health and safety of the Pres­i­dent and his fam­ily.”</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s di­ag­no­sis was an­nounced hours af­ter news broke that his close aide Hope Hicks, a for­mer White House com­mu­ni­ca­tions di­rec­tor who was among Mr Trump’s en­tourage aboard Air Force One this week, had tested pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
    <p>“Tonight, (First Lady Me­la­nia Trump) and I tested pos­i­tive for</p>
    <p>Covid-19. We will be­gin our quar­an­tine and re­cov­ery process im­me­di­ately. We will get through this to­gether!” Mr Trump wrote on Twit­ter just be­fore 1am (1pm, Sin­ga­pore time).</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s pub­lic sched­ule was up­dated to show that sev­eral events on his cal­en­dar for yes­ter­day had been can­celled.</p>
    <p>Na­tional me­dia out­lets raised a flurry of ques­tions, in­clud­ing whether there would be pos­si­ble dis­rup­tions to the elec­tion cy­cle, and even lines of suc­ces­sion should the Pres­i­dent and Vice-Pres­i­dent be med­i­cally in­ca­pac­i­tated.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has con­sis­tently down­played the sever­ity of the coro­n­avirus out­break in the US, which has in­fected 7.3 mil­lion peo­ple in the coun­try and killed more than 200,000, giv­ing mixed mes­sages about the ne­ces­sity of wear­ing masks to slow the spread of the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>As re­cently as Thurs­day night, he told sup­port­ers that a vac­cine was on track to be dis­trib­uted be­fore the end of the year, and that “the end of the pan­demic is in sight”.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, 74, falls within the age co­hort most vul­ner­a­ble to se­ri­ous cases of the virus.</p>
    <p>The White House said in June that his an­nual phys­i­cal in­di­cated he was healthy, although ob­servers noted that his height of 1.9m and weight of 110.7kg at the time put him over the med­i­cal thresh­old for obe­sity.</p>
    <p>Should the dis­ease in­ca­pac­i­tate him, Mr Trump’s party may have to face the night­mare sce­nario of re­plac­ing its can­di­date mid­stream.</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s pos­i­tive test re­sult for the coro­n­avirus could pose im­me­di­ate dif­fi­cul­ties for the fu­ture of his cam­paign against for­mer vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den, his Demo­cratic chal­lenger, with just a month be­fore the elec­tion on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>Even if Mr Trump, 74, re­mains asymp­to­matic, he will have to with­draw from the cam­paign trail and stay iso­lated in the White House for an un­known pe­riod of time.</p>
    <p>Here is what you should know about the sit­u­a­tion:</p>
    <p>STILL FIT TO RUN FOR OF­FICE?</p>
    <p>If Mr Trump be­comes sick, it could raise ques­tions about whether he should re­main on the bal­lot at all.</p>
    <p>Even if he does not be­come se­ri­ously ill, the pos­i­tive test could prove dev­as­tat­ing to his po­lit­i­cal for­tunes, given his months of di­min­ish­ing the se­ri­ous­ness of the pan­demic even as the virus was still rav­aging the coun­try and killing about 1,000 Amer­i­cans ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>He has re­peat­edly pre­dicted the virus “is go­ing to dis­ap­pear”, as­serted that it was un­der con­trol and in­sisted that the coun­try was “round­ing the cor­ner” to the end of the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>HARDER TO DODGE COVID-19 IS­SUE</p>
    <p>A pos­i­tive test will un­der­cut Mr Trump’s ef­fort to change the sub­ject ahead of the elec­tion away from a pan­demic that polls show most Amer­i­cans be­lieve he has mis­han­dled and onto po­lit­i­cal ter­rain he con­sid­ers more favourable.</p>
    <p>He has sought to fo­cus voter at­ten­tion in­stead on vi­o­lence in cities, his Supreme Court nom­i­na­tion, mail-in bal­lots and Mr Bi­den’s re­la­tion­ship with lib­er­als.</p>
    <p>SPREAD OF UN­CER­TAIN­TIES</p>
    <p>Aside from the cam­paign, the sym­bol­ism of an in­fected pres­i­dent could rat­tle gov­er­nors and business own­ers try­ing to as­sess when and how to re­open or keep open shops, schools, parks, beaches, restau­rants, fac­to­ries and other work­places.</p>
    <p>AGE RISK FOR TRUMP, 74?</p>
    <p>In his eighth decade of life, Mr Trump be­longs to the age cat­e­gory deemed most vul­ner­a­ble to the virus. Eight out of ev­ery 10 deaths at­trib­uted to it in the United States have been among those 65 and older.</p>
    <p>But while Mr Trump has been re­ported to have high choles­terol and tips the scale at around 110kg, which is con­sid­ered obese for his height, the Pres­i­dent’s doc­tor pro­nounced Mr Trump in “very good health” last year af­ter his last full med­i­cal check-up. And, un­like many of those who have suc­cumbed to the virus, he will have the best med­i­cal care avail­able.</p>
    <p>TRUMP’S CAMP UN­DER AT­TACK</p>
    <p>A va­ri­ety of peo­ple around Mr Trump were pre­vi­ously in­fected by the virus, in­clud­ing most re­cently Mr Robert O’Brien, his Na­tional Se­cu­rity Ad­viser, who had a mild case be­fore re­turn­ing to work in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers in­fected in­clude Ms Kim­berly Guil­foyle, his son’s girl­friend; a White House valet; Ms Katie Miller, Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence’s press sec­re­tary; as well as sev­eral Se­cret Ser­vice agents, cam­paign advance work­ers and a Marine in the Pres­i­dent’s he­li­copter unit.</p>
    <p>Mr Her­man Cain, a for­mer Repub­li­can pres­i­den­tial can­di­date and po­lit­i­cal ally of Mr Trump’s, died of the coro­n­avirus in July af­ter at­tend­ing the Pres­i­dent’s cam­paign rally in Tulsa, Ok­la­homa, where Mr Cain, like many in the arena, was seen not wear­ing a mask at least part of the time.</p>
    <p>FALSE BRAVADO</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has re­peat­edly ex­pressed con­fi­dence in pub­lic about his own health, say­ing he was not con­cerned about be­ing ex­posed de­spite his var­i­ous close calls.</p>
    <p>Be­hind the scenes, though, the self-de­scribed ger­mo­phobe was an­gry in the spring that his valet, who is among those who serve him food, had not been wear­ing a mask be­fore test­ing pos­i­tive, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple in touch with him.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump also pri­vately ex­pressed ir­ri­ta­tion with peo­ple who got too close to him.</p>
    <p>LET­TING DOWN THEIR GUARD</p>
    <p>Just as Mr Trump and Mr Pence were be­ing tested ev­ery day, those com­ing into prox­im­ity to them were sub­ject to daily tests as well, while other White House em­ploy­ees had tests ev­ery sev­eral days.</p>
    <p>But those pro­to­cols were soon re­laxed and most White House of­fi­cials were rarely seen wear­ing masks, at least when the Pres­i­dent was present. While the coro­n­avirus is much dead­lier than the flu, the vast ma­jor­ity of peo­ple in­fected by it re­cover, es­pe­cially if there is no un­der­ly­ing con­di­tion, but the threat climbs with age.</p>
    <p>If Mr Trump be­comes symp­to­matic, it could take him weeks to re­cover.</p>
