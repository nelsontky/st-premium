    <p>A 39-year-old man has been ar­rested for a rash act caus­ing hurt to a Domino’s Pizza staff on Christ­mas Day.</p>
    <p>Po­lice yes­ter­day said they were alerted to a fight at 505 West Coast Drive at 3.39pm on Dec 25.</p>
    <p>Videos cir­cu­lated on so­cial me­dia showed the vic­tim was punched in the face, and had his hair pulled as he was dragged across the floor by an­other man.</p>
    <p>The time stamp in the video, which ap­peared to be a closed cir­cuit cam­era footage, showed that it was taken at 3.50pm on Dec 25.</p>
    <p>Its cap­tion said that the “young man­ager” was as­saulted by a “bul­lied Domino’s rider”, and that the in­ci­dent took place at the pizza chain’s West Coast out­let.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said a 23-year-old man was con­scious when he was taken to Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>When The Straits Times vis­ited the out­let yes­ter­day, staff said the vic­tim was not around and de­clined fur­ther com­ment. Po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing.</p>
