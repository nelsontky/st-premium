    <p>A to­tal of 234 staff work­ing at Crowne Plaza Changi Air­port have tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The min­istry an­nounced on Thurs­day a spe­cial test­ing oper­a­tion of all ho­tel staff af­ter two un­linked cases were found among staff there. A third con­firmed case emerged on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>It closed the ho­tel from Fri­day un­til Jan 21 as a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure, as the pos­si­bil­ity that trans­mis­sions could have oc­curred there can­not be ruled out.</p>
    <p>The three cases were a 20-yearold male Sin­ga­porean, a 24-yearold male Korean na­tional and a 43-year-old Malaysian woman.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean had tested pos­i­tive for the more in­fec­tious UK strain of Covid-19 and his case was pend­ing fur­ther con­fir­ma­tory tests on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>All three ho­tel work­ers had de­liv­ered pre-packed meals to air crew and ho­tel guests.</p>
    <p>The min­istry also said yes­ter­day that it is in­ves­ti­gat­ing the three cases. MOH said: “From our pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions, we can­not ex­clude that trans­mis­sions could have oc­curred at the ho­tel.”</p>
    <p>MOH re­ported 29 new Covid-19 cases yes­ter­day, all of which are im­ported.</p>
    <p>They in­clude four Sin­ga­pore­ans, one of whom is a 71-year-old man who re­turned from In­dia and was asymp­to­matic. The other three ar­rived from Swe­den and the United King­dom.</p>
    <p>There were also three de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers who ar­rived from the United Arab Emi­rates, In­dia and the Mal­dives.</p>
    <p>Also among the im­ported cases was a spe­cial pass holder who is a sea crew mem­ber. He ar­rived from In­done­sia on board a ves­sel and was swabbed upon ar­rival. He was taken to the hos­pi­tal when his test re­sult came back pos­i­tive for Covid-19 in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, In­dian restau­rant Sri Aachi Aap­pakadai in Lit­tle In­dia was added to the list of places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were still in­fec­tious, said MOH.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has de­creased from 10 cases in the week be­fore to eight cases in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has in­creased from four cases in the week be­fore to five cases in the past week.</p>
    <p>With 31 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,596 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the disease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 67 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, in­clud­ing one in the in­ten­sive care unit, while 158 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. Singapore has had 29 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
