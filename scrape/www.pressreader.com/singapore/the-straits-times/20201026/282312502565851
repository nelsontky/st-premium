    <p>A month into Malaysia’s move­ment con­trol or­der (MCO), soft­ware business owner Ariff Azraai was sad­dled with a moun­tain of bills.</p>
    <p>As clients were de­fer­ring projects and pay­ments, the 28-year-old de­cided to cash out his unit trusts, which he ex­pected would tank with the im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic on the economy, and take a plunge into the stock mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter pay­ing my debts, I am back with my orig­i­nal cap­i­tal. Thank God, we have six listed glove com­pa­nies,” he joked, re­fer­ring to the boom in rub­ber glove shares dur­ing the global out­break that has seen their val­ues jump by up to 17 times com­pared to the end of last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Ariff is just one of more than 276,000 new re­tail ac­count hold­ers on Bursa Malaysia who signed up between March and last month. This is about 170 per cent more than the num­ber of new open­ings in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts and in­dus­try in­sid­ers at­tribute the ex­tra­or­di­nary growth to a com­bi­na­tion of ex­cess cash dur­ing the MCO – which slowed business and pre­vented over­seas travel – cou­pled with the close to RM100 bil­lion (S$33 bil­lion) re­leased by a loan mora­to­rium, pent-up de­mand for liq­uid as­sets with good yields and a lower bar­rier to en­try for fresh en­trants into what re­mains a highly tech­ni­cal mar­ket.</p>
    <p>This “per­fect storm” helped Bursa Malaysia to stay afloat de­spite the flight of for­eign funds dur­ing the on­go­ing Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The bench­mark Kuala Lumpur Com­pos­ite In­dex (KLCI) ended March 19 – the day af­ter the MCO was de­clared – at about 1,220 points, its low­est in 11 years.</p>
    <p>Since then, though, the bourse has sur­passed last year’s close of 1,589 sev­eral times and breached the 1,600 bar­rier in July and Au­gust. It is now hover­ing around 1,500.</p>
    <p>Re­tail in­vestors ac­counted for more than a third of the value of stocks traded so far this year. Last year, they ac­counted for 24.5 per cent, which was al­ready the high­est since 2015.</p>
    <p>These in­vestors have soaked up more than half the RM22 bil­lion of shares dumped by for­eign funds so far this year, com­pared to their net buy of just RM2 bil­lion in the whole of last year.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mist Hafiz Noor Shams from the Re­search for So­cial Ad­vance­ment think-tank told The Straits Times that there has been a huge in­crease in “free cash with nowhere to go”.</p>
    <p>De­spite the eco­nomic down­turn – gross do­mes­tic prod­uct was down 17 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter and is widely ex­pected to re­main in con­trac­tion for the third quar­ter – the RM609 bil­lion in sav­ings and de­mand de­posits at the end of Au­gust was nearly 16 per cent higher than at the end of Fe­bru­ary be­fore the MCO. Growth in the same pe­riod last year was less than 2 per cent.</p>
    <p>In an e-mail re­sponse to The Straits Times, Bursa Malaysia in­di­cated that the low­est in­ter­est rate in 16 years of 1.75 per cent “has en­cour­aged re­tail in­vestors to look at the eq­uity mar­ket”.</p>
    <p>Malaysians ap­pear to have moved away from tra­di­tional safe havens which hedge against in­fla­tion, like prop­erty, where yields are low.</p>
    <p>The trans­ac­tion value of prop­erty plunged 31.5 per cent in the first half of the year to just RM47 bil­lion with this year’s Q2 the worst per­form­ing in terms of house price growth in the past decade.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing put aside money for stocks, I am now look­ing at cheaper prop­er­ties be­low RM700,000 in­stead of RM900,000 or more,” said cor­po­rate com­mu­ni­ca­tions man­ager Leanne Lee, 38.</p>
    <p>Like many other new and young in­vestors, she has an ac­count with Rakuten Trade, a lead­ing on­line plat­form, which says 75 per cent of its clients are be­low 40 years old and that most have lit­tle or no prior ex­pe­ri­ence in eq­ui­ties.</p>
    <p>Rakuten Trade added 80,000 cus­tomers dur­ing the MCO, and in the past four months dou­bled as­sets held in trust to over RM2 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Mr Victor Liew, a man­ag­ing con­sul­tant at a lo­cal in­vest­ment firm, told The Straits Times that cheaper bro­ker­age and the de­crease in lot size to 100 units from 1,000 helped lower the bar­rier to en­try.</p>
    <p>“There has been pent-up de­mand for higher-risk liq­uid in­vest­ments, which is why you have seen ram­pant growth of money games,” he said, re­fer­ring to var­i­ous un­reg­u­lated in­vest­ment schemes that have re­sulted in Malaysians los­ing bil­lions of ring­git.</p>
