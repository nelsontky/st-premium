    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong yes­ter­day ex­pressed his thanks to mi­grant work­ers in Sin­ga­pore for their trust, pa­tience and sup­port de­spite hav­ing gone through a dif­fi­cult pe­riod since Sin­ga­pore de­tected its first Covid-19 cases among them al­most a year back.</p>
    <p>It took a “tremen­dous ef­fort” to reach the cur­rent sta­bilised sit­u­a­tion, but mi­grant work­ers are healthy and safe from the virus, said PM Lee in a video mes­sage mark­ing In­ter­na­tional Mi­grants Day.</p>
    <p>“We could not have done this with­out your co­op­er­a­tion and sac­ri­fices,” he said.</p>
    <p>PM Lee as­sured mi­grant work­ers that they will be cared for just as Sin­ga­pore­ans are cared for.</p>
    <p>“You are wel­comed mem­bers of our so­ci­ety. If you fall ill, we will make sure you get med­i­cal care, stay in touch with your fam­i­lies, and can re­turn to work as soon as pos­si­ble,” he said.</p>
    <p>PM Lee noted that the rules put in place to keep the Covid-19 spread in check are grad­u­ally be­ing eased in mi­grant worker dor­mi­to­ries and the wider com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Be­sides be­ing able to visit recre­ational cen­tres, mi­grant work­ers can now also take part in com­mu­nal ac­tiv­i­ties like cook­ing and sports, he said.</p>
    <p>“With some luck, if the num­ber of cases stays very low, we can ease up fur­ther. Please stay vig­i­lant, and co­op­er­ate with the Govern­ment and with your em­ploy­ers to keep ev­ery­one safe.</p>
    <p>“On be­half of all Sin­ga­pore­ans, I thank you once again for all your con­tri­bu­tions and sup­port, and I wish you a very happy In­ter­na­tional Mi­grants Day!”</p>
    <p>To mark the oc­ca­sion, the Mi­grant Work­ers’ Cen­tre (MWC) un­der the Na­tional Trades Union Congress has or­gan­ised a se­ries of ac­tiv­i­ties and events that started on Sunday and will last till Dec 27.</p>
    <p>MWC said in a state­ment that it aims to reach out to 20,000 work­ers through th­ese cel­e­bra­tions to thank them for their con­tri­bu­tions to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers can par­tic­i­pate in a dig­i­tal road­show co-hosted by MWC and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions com­pany Sing­tel on MWC’s Face­book page, which fea­tures per­for­mances by Bangladesh­i and In­dian celebri­ties as well as games with prizes to be won.</p>
    <p>MWC will also present its an­nual awards to 20 mi­grant worker</p>
    <p>“grass­roots am­bas­sadors” to recog­nise their ef­forts in go­ing “above and be­yond” to help fel­low work­ers dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Phys­i­cal road­shows, where Sing­tel will of­fer dis­counts and pro­mo­tions, are also be­ing held at the MWC Recre­ation Cen­tre in Soon Lee Road un­til to­mor­row for mi­grant work­ers with valid exit passes al­low­ing them to leave their dorms.</p>
    <p>MWC said in its state­ment that it has spared no ef­fort in help­ing mi­grant work­ers get through the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“In 2020 alone, MWC has reached out to more than 650,000 mi­grant work­ers – the largest num­ber of mi­grant work­ers helped in a year,” MWC said.</p>
    <p>It added that it has dis­trib­uted more than five mil­lion es­sen­tial items, such as masks, hand sani­tiser and soap, to work­ers liv­ing in dorms and tem­po­rary quar­ters, and it has also pro­vided al­most a mil­lion meals to some 10,000 work­ers liv­ing in fac­tory-con­verted dorms.</p>
    <p>MWC said it also sup­ported the de­ploy­ment of 130 telemedici­ne kiosks to more than 120 dorms and tem­po­rary quar­ters to pro­vide mi­grant work­ers di­rect ac­cess to med­i­cal help and sup­port.</p>
