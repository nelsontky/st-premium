    <p>After a year of up­heaval in which Covid-19 wrecked the sport­ing cal­en­dar, as­sis­tant sports edi­tor Ro­hit Bri­j­nath picks 20 things he would like to see next year. Among them are foot­ball great Lionel Messi fea­tur­ing in the English Premier League, Sin­ga­pore swim­mer Joseph School­ing go­ing fast again at the Olympics and chil­dren choos­ing ten­nis star Naomi Osaka as their role model.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>Once the vac­cines are done, do you mind if we find a cure for a Swiss knee? So that we can squeeze one more oohing, sigh­ing, Wim­ble­don out of the old man of the lawns. Ev­ery­one needs a chance for a farewell weep. Es­pe­cially Roger Fed­erer.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>He’s crankier, slower, older, scores less, will be 34 in the sum­mer and so it’s a per­fect time for Lionel Messi to come to</p>
    <p>Eng­land and mock those who said he can’t han­dle the Premier</p>
    <p>League.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>The Olympics. Please. So that kayak­ers, shoot­ers, ju­dokas, all those bril­liant ath­letes we can’t name get their oc­ca­sional chance to pa­rade their skills. In his prime, leg­endary archer Im Dong-hyun could snip your ci­gar some days with an ar­row from 70m. And he’s vis­ually im­paired.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>Joseph School­ing hits a good, fast time in Tokyo. Let’s never get blase about gold, let’s never for­get what he did. Sport is about the fu­ture, but you can’t erase the past.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>Cyn­ics – and there are a few out there – give Sin­ga­pore ath­letes what they de­serve: Re­spect. Stop ask­ing why they’re tak­ing a year off from aca­demics. Stop say­ing find a job. Stop talk­ing and lis­ten to their dreams. Ap­plaud their ef­fort. You want a bet­ter car, fine. They want to go to the Olympics. Don’t de­value their jour­ney.</p>
    <p>6</p>
    <p>Both foot­ball teams walk off if there’s racist chant­ing in the stands. Enough now. Enough of the counter ar­gu­ments. Enough of do­ing noth­ing. It’s time for foot­ball to stand for some­thing. 7</p>
    <p>All this stuff about head­ing in foot­ball, con­cus­sion in rugby, early on­set de­men­tia in ath­letes, is taken se­ri­ously. Safety al­ways over­rides en­ter­tain­ment. When we say “body on the line”, we can’t mean this.</p>
    <p>8</p>
    <p>Peo­ple dis­cover Joan Mir, Carissa Moore, Nour El Sherbini. I mean, you’re a sports fan, right? 9</p>
    <p>Ser­ena in a Grand Slam fi­nal. One last chance. One last bout of fury. One last look at the great­est women’s ath­lete there might have been. But no last tantrums.</p>
    <p>10</p>
    <p>When kids choose a role model, they don’t only look at skill, earn­ings, celebrity, style but at char­ac­ter. Ex­hibit A: Naomi Osaka.</p>
    <p>11</p>
    <p>Western com­men­ta­tors learn to pro­nounce Asian names. It’s not hard. We’ll help. In cricket, in some in­stances, sport with sound but no com­men­tary might be an idea.</p>
    <p>12</p>
    <p>Full stands, strangers high-fiv­ing, feel­ing the fever of the mob, singing badly. Faith found again.</p>
    <p>13</p>
    <p>Some Sin­ga­pore sports as­so­ci­a­tions learn to be less pro­tec­tive of their ath­letes. Let them speak, find their per­son­al­ity, be them­selves. Sport fun­da­men­tally is an ex­er­cise in self-ex­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>14</p>
    <p>Tiger Woods re­leases his ver­sion of The Last Dance. 15</p>
    <p>Novel ways for peo­ple to ex­pe­ri­ence the skill of great ath­letes. Like set­ting a tread­mill – as once hap­pened – at Eliud Kip­choge’s marathon world-record speed and ask­ing peo­ple to hop on. Or build­ing a ro­bot which smashes at Carolina Marin’s speed. The gulf be­tween what they do and what we do is in­com­pre­hen­si­ble.</p>
    <p>16</p>
    <p>More women coaches, more women in po­si­tions of author­ity, more stat­ues of women le­gends, more pro­tec­tion of women ath­letes. We’re too long a way from true equal­ity.</p>
    <p>17</p>
    <p>Golf re­quires re­flec­tion, but Moby Dick can be read in the time it takes some peo­ple to putt. Speed up, folks. And if you hit it 140m on your best day, be hum­ble, try the white tees.</p>
    <p>18</p>
    <p>Monaco wins an Olympic medal. Sum­mer Games: 20; Win­ter Games: 10; Medals: 0. They’ve had enough of the par­tic­i­pa­tion spiel. Just put them on a podium.</p>
    <p>19</p>
    <p>Ath­letes don’t abuse their bod­ies in search of mil­lisec­onds. Don’t in­gest drugs, don’t suf­fer body im­age is­sues, don’t let them­selves be bul­lied by tyran­ni­cal coaches, don’t re­spond to the blood­lust of fans. Win­ning can’t be that im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>20</p>
    <p>We re­mem­ber the small, fi­nan­cially strapped clubs across the planet, with their rick­ety club­houses and kit sewn by lo­cal fam­i­lies, where vil­lages gather on week­ends and kids play along­side paunchy fa­thers and tin cups are the prize. For­get su­per­stars, this is where sport is kept alive.</p>
