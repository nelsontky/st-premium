    <p>In late March this year, Sin­ga­pore did some­thing it had never done be­fore — close its bor­ders to tourists and short-term vis­i­tors. The coun­try en­tered into cir­cuit breaker mode shortly af­ter, with peo­ple en­cour­aged to stay largely at home to help curb the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>De­spite be­ing faced with an in­vis­i­ble and po­tent en­emy in such un­prece­dented times, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Q&M Den­tal Group Dr Ng Chin Siau did not al­low fear to take over. He is­sued a “call to arms” to his staff den­tists, ask­ing those who were will­ing to step for­ward to vol­un­teer to do the swabs for for­eign work­ers in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>His ral­ly­ing call to them: You have the skills, the in­fec­tion con­trol know-how, the per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment, and most im­por­tantly — the coun­try needs you. Over 170 den­tists from the group rose to the oc­ca­sion and Q&M be­came the first pri­vate den­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion to vol­un­teer man­power to as­sist the gov­ern­ment in swab­bing ef­forts.</p>
    <p>For its ini­tia­tive and con­tri­bu­tion, Q&M Den­tal Group has emerged as a win­ner in the Or­gan­i­sa­tions of Good cat­e­gory in this year’s Pres­i­dent’s Vol­un­teerism & Phi­lan­thropy Awards (PVPA) 2020 Spe­cial Edi­tion on Oct 16.</p>
    <p>This spe­cial edi­tion, ti­tled “Our Finest Hour in the City of Good”, sought to recog­nise in­di­vid­u­als, or­gan­i­sa­tions and lead­ers who had vol­un­tar­ily devoted their time, tal­ent, re­sources and voice to cre­ate a pos­i­tive im­pact in the com­mu­nity amid the chal­lenges of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The PVPA is or­gan­ised an­nu­ally by the Na­tional Vol­un­teer & Phi­lan­thropy Cen­tre (NVPC), who is the stew­ard of the City of Good vi­sion of a Sin­ga­pore where ev­ery­one gives their best for oth­ers, with sup­port from the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth. Th­ese awards hon­our the ef­forts of out­stand­ing in­di­vid­u­als, or­gan­i­sa­tions and lead­ers for their con­tri­bu­tion, and aim to in­spire the pub­lic to give their best for oth­ers so as to build a City of Good.</p>
    <p>So­cial worker Ong Bee Yong, pro­ject direc­tor of Cri­sis Re­lief Al­liance (CRA) Counsellin­g Ser­vice, is one of the win­ners un­der the Lead­ers of Good cat­e­gory. Five years ago, Ms Ong and some friends started CRA to re­spond to in­ter­na­tional crises such as the floods in Myan­mar, ty­phoon in the Philip­pines, as well as the earth­quake and tsunami in In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>When Covid-19 hit Sin­ga­pore, she knew CRA had the ex­pe­ri­ence and ex­per­tise to al­le­vi­ate the cri­sis that was now at her doorstep. Since March, CRA stepped up to sup­port the well-be­ing of front­line health­care work­ers and for­eign work­ers in the dor­mi­to­ries by set­ting up ded­i­cated</p>
    <p>hot­lines for them. Their coun­sel­lors also joined med­i­cal teams on the ground at the dor­mi­to­ries to bet­ter un­der­stand the liv­ing con­di­tions there, in or­der to be more ef­fec­tive dur­ing the hot­line counsellin­g ses­sions.</p>
    <p>Chair­man of NVPC Mil­dred Tan says: “The re­mark­able good that has emerged from the pan­demic demon­strates the cre­ative ca­pac­ity within our com­mu­ni­ties, which came to­gether to make this Sin­ga­pore’s Finest Hour yet. Let us re­mem­ber that we are not alone in this, and the fight is far from over, but to­gether, we can all come to­gether to build a City of Good.”</p>
    <p>Even smaller ef­forts to feed peo­ple who may be feel­ing the pinch of buy­ing their own meals do make a sig­nif­i­cant im­pact in the lives of those in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>Founders of hawker stall Beng Who</p>
    <p>Cooks Ja­son Chua and Hung Zhen Long have fed over 1,000 peo­ple by cook­ing 60 meals a day for peo­ple in need since the start of the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Af­ter wit­ness­ing the two young men cook­ing all the meals by them­selves with­out any help, a ben­e­fi­ciary was mo­ti­vated to find a job at a cof­fee shop, in­stead of ask­ing for free meals. In recog­ni­tion of their ef­forts, they re­ceived a Spe­cial Com­men­da­tion award un­der the Peo­ple of Good cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>Six awardees, in­clud­ing Q&M Den­tal Group’s Dr Ng, Ms Ong as well as Mr Chua, will be speak­ing at spe­cial TEDx Sa­lon ses­sions hap­pen­ing on­line on Oct 24, 31 and Nov 7. They will share their per­spec­tives on why and how they do what they do, so that more peo­ple can ei­ther join them or dream up their own ideas to up­lift the com­mu­nity.</p>
