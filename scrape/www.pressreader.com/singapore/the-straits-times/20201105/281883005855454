    <p>• Ja­panese health of­fi­cials have found 164 ema­ci­ated dogs crammed into a tiny house in one of the coun­try’s worst cases of an­i­mal hoard­ing, an an­i­mal rights ac­tivist said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The par­a­site-in­fested an­i­mals were found last month in a 30 sq m house in the city of Izumo in western Ja­pan, after neigh­bours had com­plained, said Mr Ku­ni­hisa Sagami, the head of an­i­mal rights group Dobut­sukikin.</p>
    <p>The dogs lived crammed onto shelves and un­der ta­bles and chairs.</p>
    <p>“The en­tire floor was filled with dogs and all the floor space you</p>
    <p>could see was cov­ered with fae­ces,” said Mr Sagami.</p>
    <p>Public health of­fi­cials first vis­ited the house seven years ago after get­ting complaints about the noise and smell, but the owner re­fused to let of­fi­cials in­ves­ti­gate at that time.</p>
    <p>The three peo­ple liv­ing in the house said they could not af­ford to spay and neuter the dogs, so they kept get­ting more of them.</p>
    <p>Mr Sagami said the fam­ily agreed to give up the dogs, and his group would look for fos­ter homes for them after they have re­ceived med­i­cal care.</p>
