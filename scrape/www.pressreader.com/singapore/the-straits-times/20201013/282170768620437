    <p>HONG KONG • Home-grown in­vest­ment bankers in Hong Kong are rapidly los­ing their sta­tus as the city’s go-to deal­mak­ers, sup­planted by main­land Chi­nese ri­vals who now hold a ma­jor­ity of se­nior jobs in Asia’s big­gest fi­nan­cial hub.</p>
    <p>While the shift has long seemed in­evitable, given the ex­pand­ing pool of main­land tal­ent and dom­i­nant role of Chi­nese is­suers in Hong Kong, the re­cent pace of change has jolted even some in­dus­try vet­er­ans.</p>
    <p>They say it is partly ex­plained by a re­luc­tance among Chi­nese se­cu­ri­ties firms to hire and pro­mote Hongkonger­s af­ter anti-gov­ern­ment protests rocked the for­mer Bri­tish colony last year.</p>
    <p>Lo­cals’ share of i nvest­ment bank­ing j obs i n the city has slumped to about 30 per cent from 40 per cent two years ago, with 60 per cent of roles now filled by main­lan­ders and 10 per cent by over­seas na­tion­als, ac­cord­ing to re­cruit­ing firm Robert Wal­ters.</p>
    <p>The trend has been sim­i­lar in the in­dus­try’s up­per ech­e­lons, where main­lan­ders ac­count for more than half of se­nior roles, es­ti­mates from ex­ec­u­tive search firm Welles­ley show.</p>
    <p>The fig­ures un­der­score the un­cer­tain eco­nomic future fac­ing even well-to-do Hongkonger­s, many of whom thrived for decades by act­ing as fi­nan­cial in­ter­me­di­aries be­tween a ris­ing China and the rest of the world.</p>
    <p>While some in the in­dus­try have en­joyed rel­a­tive sta­bil­ity in roles like trad­ing that rely less on client re­la­tion­ships, those jobs also may come un­der threat as China makes it eas­ier for global firms to by­pass Hong Kong and ac­cess on­shore mar­kets di­rectly.</p>
    <p>Mr John Mul­lally, re­gional di­rec­tor at Robert Wal­ters in Hong Kong, said: “With such a vast per­cent­age of deals com­ing out of main­land China, it’s un­der­stand­able that many of those re­la­tion­ships are owned by main­land Chi­nese bankers.”</p>
    <p>He said main­lan­ders com­prised just 15 per cent of the in­dus­try 20 years ago, be­fore wide­spread ac­cess to study abroad pro­grammes and other in­ter­na­tional ex­pe­ri­ence helped China nar­row its skills gap with Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The new en­vi­ron­ment has stymied even some of the most ex­pe­ri­enced Hong Kong bankers.</p>
    <p>Mr Tse, a for­mer man­ag­ing di­rec­tor at large United States and Euro­pean in­vest­ment banks who now works at a mid-sized main­land Chi­nese bro­ker­age, said he has had a hard time crack­ing the in­ner cir­cle at his new firm. His salary is about the same now as it was more than a decade ago, while main­land hires out­num­ber Hongkonger­s by four-to-one in his di­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>“Most of the Hong Kong bankers, in­clud­ing my­self, are learn­ing how to toe the Chi­nese line,” said Mr Tse, who asked that his full name not be used be­cause he is not au­tho­rised to speak to the me­dia. “The cul­tural shocks and dif­fer­ences are still im­mense.”</p>
    <p>As the sup­ply of bankers from the main­land has in­creased, pay pack­ages across the city have dwin­dled. Com­pen­sa­tion for se­nior roles has dropped 15 per cent to 20 per cent over the past five years, said Welles­ley chief ex­ec­u­tive Chris­tian Brun.</p>
    <p>Se­nior man­ag­ing di­rec­tors typ­i­cally take home any­where from US$850,000 (S$1.15 mil­lion) to US$1.75 mil­lion, ver­sus US$1 mil­lion to US$2 mil­lion in 2015, ac­cord­ing to a per­son fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter who has sev­eral hir­ing man­dates with bulge-bracket firms in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>And it is not just Chi­nese firms in Hong Kong that are hir­ing from the main­land. Mor­gan Stan­ley has pro­moted about 15 man­ag­ing di­rec­tors from main­land China since 2016, com­pared with 11 Hongkonger­s, ac­cord­ing to com­pany an­nounce­ments an­a­lysed by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>Gold­man Sachs Group ap­pointed three Chi­nese na­tion­als to its most re­cent part­ner class in 2018, the most ever from the coun­try. The group in­cluded Mr Wei Cai, the firm’s head of China in­vest­ment bank­ing.</p>
    <p>The firm’s se­nior pro­mo­tions for Hongkonger­s in re­cent years have mostly come in ar­eas that are less client fac­ing, such as trad­ing, re­search and sup­port func­tions.</p>
    <p>Gold­man Sachs and Mor­gan Stan­ley de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>“More than 90 per cent of the searches we con­duct in Hong Kong re­quire man­darin flu­ency at least and a strong pref­er­ence for PRC can­di­dates,” said Mr Brun, re­fer­ring to the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China, the coun­try’s of­fi­cial name.</p>
    <p>That has also left fewer op­por­tu­ni­ties for ex­pa­tri­ates from places like Bri­tain and Amer­ica, who ac­counted for just 7 per cent of se­nior hires in Asia at the re­gion’s eight big­gest bulge-bracket in­vest­ment banks, he said.</p>
    <p>Hongkonger­s still hold some of the in­dus­try’s most prom­i­nent roles. Mr Mark Le­ung is the China chief ex­ec­u­tive at JP­Mor­gan Chase and Mr Pierre Chu is co­head of China merg­ers and ac­qui­si­tions at Gold­man Sachs. Sev­eral heads of China in­vest­ment bank­ing, in­clud­ing UBS Group’s John Lee and Credit Suisse Group’s Joe Lai, are also from Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>While sev­eral of their high-pro­file peers have left the in­dus­try in re­cent years, they have mostly landed on their feet. Mr Ed­ward Lau, a for­mer di­rec­tor at Deutsche Bank, is now a deputy fi­nan­cial con­troller at New World De­vel­op­ment, one of Hong Kong’s big­gest prop­erty com­pa­nies. Mr Mervyn Chow, who ran Greater China for Credit Suisse, left in 2018 for in­vest­ment gi­ant Hill­house Cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>One po­ten­tial ad­van­tage for lo­cal bankers is that they face a more favourable tax regime in Hong Kong than their main­land peers. China’s gov­ern­ment re­cently be­gan im­pos­ing a levy on its cit­i­zens’ off­shore in­come, a de­ci­sion that could leave main­land bankers in Hong Kong pay­ing triple the lo­cal rate as well as foot­ing the bill for the city’s sky-high liv­ing costs. Some are al­ready con­sid­er­ing moves back to China if their em­ploy­ers do not in­crease salaries to off­set the new tax.</p>
    <p>The long-term risk for Hong Kong’s lo­cal bankers is that the city’s role as a fi­nan­cial hub starts to fade. China’s im­po­si­tion of a sweep­ing na­tional se­cu­rity law on Hong Kong has blurred the lines be­tween the two ju­ris­dic­tions, and the threat of eco­nom­i­cally crip­pling sanc­tions from the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion still hangs over the city.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in­ter­na­tional firms have re­cently been given a green light from Bei­jing to build up their op­er­a­tions on the main­land.</p>
    <p>Mor­gan Stan­ley has al­ready moved 15 bankers and ex­ec­u­tives to its China ven­ture from lo­ca­tions in­clud­ing Hong Kong. UBS has re­lo­cated about five em­ploy­ees from Hong Kong to Bei­jing, while Credit Suisse moved two ex­ec­u­tives to the Chi­nese cap­i­tal to head its se­cu­ri­ties ven­ture.</p>
    <p>For­eign banks will find it much cheaper to hire staff on the main­land, ac­cord­ing to Mr Eric Zhu, head of fi­nan­cials at re­cruiter Mor­gan McKin­ley. Em­ploy­ing a first year an­a­lyst at a bulge-bracket firm in China costs around US$51,000, com­pared with as much as US$100,000 in Hong Kong, he said.</p>
    <p>“The big­gest in­flu­ence on this trend came in the change in reg­u­la­tions al­low­ing in­ter­na­tional firms to have con­trol of their on­shore en­ti­ties,” Mr Brun said.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­thing else, in­clud­ing the Hong Kong protests, the po­lit­i­cal tur­moil, and the US-China grind all sim­ply ac­cel­er­ate and con­cen­trate the move on­shore.”</p>
