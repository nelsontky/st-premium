    <p>Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong and Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat have sent their con­grat­u­la­tions to newly elected lead­ers in the United States.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Hal­imah con­grat­u­lated Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den and Vice-Pres­i­dent-elect Ka­mala Har­ris on their “vic­tory in a hard fought election” in a Face­book post yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She called Mr Bi­den, who will be the 46th US pres­i­dent, a “good friend of Sin­ga­pore”. She also lauded Ms Har­ris, not­ing that she was “heart­ened” at her be­com­ing “Amer­ica’s first fe­male, black and South Asian Vice-Pres­i­dent”.</p>
    <p>“This is the his­toric mo­ment for women mi­nori­ties in the US and around the world,” she said, adding that Ms Har­ris was an in­spi­ra­tion to many young women.</p>
    <p>Said Pres­i­dent Hal­imah: “This lat­est ap­point­ment caps a high point for her. Yet she is hum­ble and of­ten at­tributes her suc­cess to the hard work of those who came be­fore her.”</p>
    <p>In sep­a­rate notes to Mr Bi­den and Ms Har­ris, PM Lee af­firmed the shared in­ter­ests and ro­bust friend­ship that the US has with Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He said in his let­ter to the Pres­i­dent-elect that many coun­tries are look­ing for­ward to the global lead­er­ship of the US un­der the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion, to work to­gether and over­come chal­lenges, es­pe­cially the im­me­di­ate cri­sis of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>PM Lee high­lighted the strong eco­nomic ties the two coun­tries have, with the US-Sin­ga­pore Free Trade Agree­ment, as well as Sin­ga­pore’s sta­tus as the US’ largest trad­ing part­ner in South-east Asia and its third largest Asian in­vestor last year.</p>
    <p>He also noted the close part­ner­ship in the area of se­cu­rity with Sin­ga­pore as the US’ only Ma­jor Se­cu­rity Co­op­er­a­tion Part­ner and the re­cently re­newed 1990 Mem­o­ran­dum of Un­der­stand­ing that al­lows the US use of Sin­ga­pore’s mil­i­tary fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“(This) un­der­scores our sup­port for the US’ pres­ence, which re­mains vi­tal for peace, sta­bil­ity and pros­per­ity in the Asia-Pa­cific,” said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>DPM Heng con­grat­u­lated the Vice-Pres­i­dent-elect in a let­ter, not­ing that the win comes at a “crit­i­cal junc­ture”.</p>
    <p>He said: “I look for­ward to meet­ing you in the near fu­ture to dis­cuss how both sides can en­hance bi­lat­eral co­op­er­a­tion and strengthen the United States’ en­gage­ment of the Asia-Pa­cific.”</p>
