    <p>These images stir a sense of nos­tal­gia and pride in me, a feel­ing you will no doubt share – es­pe­cially today, our na­tion’s birthday.</p>
    <p>They are, af­ter all, the Repub­lic’s na­tional sym­bols, cre­ated ex­actly to forge a sense of na­tional unity.</p>
    <p>But with Covid-19, dust has dulled the sheen of the na­tional crest em­bla­zoned on our pass­ports in the past few months.</p>
    <p>It has gath­ered on the images of our beau­ti­ful Vanda Miss Joaquim, the or­chid im­printed on shelves of lan­guish­ing tourist sou­venirs.</p>
    <p>School as­sem­blies in the morn­ings, usu­ally filled with the voices of stu­dents singing the fa­mil­iar lines of Ma­ju­lah Sin­ga­pura and recit­ing “We the cit­i­zens...”, have gone silent.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Day it­self, nor­mally a bois­ter­ous an­nual cel­e­bra­tion re­plete with these sym­bols of na­tion­hood, has not been spared.</p>
    <p>Today’s pa­rade has been pared down and cel­e­bra­tions are de­cen­tralised.</p>
    <p>In­stead of tens of thou­sands gath­ered at the Padang or Ma­rina Bay, most of us will be hun­kered down in our homes.</p>
    <p>Amid these muted, te­dious days of the pan­demic, I find my­self ask­ing: Whither is the rous­ing roar of the Sin­ga­pore spirit this Na­tional Day? With ev­ery­one scat­tered, where will we find a sense of unity?</p>
    <p>Some might re­ply that the cri­sis it­self has pre­sented an an­swer.</p>
    <p>They might say: There is spirit in the quiet strength of our nurses, doc­tors and other front-lin­ers, who have toiled for months in the fight against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>There is unity in our col­lec­tive strength in meet­ing this cri­sis, the re­silience and for­ti­tude of our peo­ple as they weather this storm in sol­i­dar­ity with one an­other.</p>
    <p>I fully agree, and I think it would be hard to find any­one who does not. Per­haps a dif­fer­ent ques­tion to pon­der is: Who does your united Sin­ga­pore in­clude (or ex­clude)?</p>
    <p>Even as the pan­demic has shown us a side of a Sin­ga­pore united in the face of an in­vis­i­ble en­emy, so, too, it has re­vealed a Sin­ga­pore di­vided in other ways.</p>
    <p>All of us felt the edge of the cir­cuit breaker – a harsh but nec­es­sary stop on most ac­tiv­ity to con­trol the spread of the virus – but some felt it more keenly than oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Those who were al­ready vul­ner­a­ble, such as the el­derly liv­ing alone or lower-in­come fam­i­lies, strug­gled to meet their ba­sic needs.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in the dor­mi­to­ries make up more than nine in 10 Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Of course, the Gov­ern­ment’s ef­forts have im­proved the sit­u­a­tion at the dorms and ad­dressed the more im­me­di­ate is­sues faced by the vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>And af­ter re­port­ing on some of the is­sues these groups face, I have of­ten found my­self over­whelmed by the out­pour­ing of of­fers to help them from read­ers and com­mu­nity groups moved by their plight.</p>
    <p>It glad­dens me to see Sin­ga­pore­ans dis­play such com­pas­sion. But be­yond pity, I hope we can go a step fur­ther, to truly in­clude them in our so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Some of us may also ex­clude those who hold dis­sent­ing opin­ions. A dif­fer­ent point of view may not nec­es­sar­ily mean a per­son loves Sin­ga­pore less.</p>
    <p>Our po­lit­i­cal lead­ers have given en­cour­ag­ing sig­nals on be­ing more open about dis­cussing race and reli­gion.</p>
    <p>But some, per­haps among the older gen­er­a­tion, may still feel the topic to be ta­boo, even if this may risk si­lenc­ing those who have suf­fered dis­crim­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>While great strides have been made for gen­der equal­ity in the last five decades, women con­tinue to be paid less than men for the same work, and are un­der-rep­re­sented at the top.</p>
    <p>And while there are the be­gin­nings of greater le­gal pro­tec­tions for LGBTQ (les­bian, gay, bi­sex­ual, trans­gen­der and queer) peo­ple, as a na­tion we have some way to go be­fore ac­cept­ing the com­mu­nity more fully and equally as mem­bers of so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>There is no sim­ple so­lu­tion to the ten­sion be­tween unity and the in­equal­i­ties and di­ver­sity of any so­ci­ety. This is es­pe­cially the case for Sin­ga­pore, a na­tion still young in years, and with ex­ist­ing fault lines along race and reli­gion.</p>
    <p>It is a dif­fi­cult ter­rain we have been care­fully ne­go­ti­at­ing for 55 years – and count­ing.</p>
    <p>I in­ad­ver­tently found hints of an an­swer while lis­ten­ing to the Na­tional Day theme song.</p>
    <p>In con­trast to the up­beat pa­tri­otic tunes of the past (think Stand Up For Sin­ga­pore), this year’s Ev­ery­thing I Am, writ­ten by</p>
    <p>Joshua Wan, is slow and thought­ful, per­haps even philo­soph­i­cal.</p>
    <p>In one part, lo­cal singer Nathan Hartono pleads, in an odd turn of phrase: “Teacher, teach me to be kind. / Quick to em­brace, and slow to close my mind.”</p>
    <p>To move for­ward as a united Sin­ga­pore, we – as a na­tion – need to be open and em­pa­thetic to oth­ers, to new ideas, and to re­con­nect with our core na­tional val­ues of open­ness and in­clu­siv­ity.</p>
    <p>To this end, I think there have been sev­eral signs of hope.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic it­self has cre­ated a space for civil so­ci­ety to pro­vide sug­ges­tions on var­i­ous poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Where older gen­er­a­tions may find it dif­fi­cult to talk about cer­tain is­sues, younger ones seem more will­ing to ad­dress them head-on.</p>
    <p>Com­mit­ments have been made to im­prove the liv­ing con­di­tions of mi­grant work­ers in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans re­cently elected a record num­ber of women into Par­lia­ment – 27 of 93 seats.</p>
    <p>The Prime Min­is­ter, af­ter the polls, also ac­knowl­edged that Sin­ga­pore­ans want more di­verse voices.</p>
    <p>So, what should a united Sin­ga­pore mean to you and me?</p>
    <p>Be­yond our na­tional flag, flower and crest, I in­vite you to imag­ine a so­ci­ety united by a com­mon re­solve to be just and equal to all, that truly in­cludes, rather than re­jects, dif­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>A Sin­ga­pore where, in Wan’s words, “Be­cause of who you are / I can be ev­ery­thing I am”.</p>
