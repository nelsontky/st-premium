    <p>Li­bra­tone is prob­a­bly more known for its sleek wire­less speak­ers, but the Den­mark au­dio com­pany has en­tered the true wire­less in-ear head­phones mar­ket with its Track Air+.</p>
    <p>Launched last Au­gust and avail­able here since May, the Track Air+ comes in black (ver­sion tested) and white mod­els and fea­tures ac­tive noise can­cel­la­tion (ANC) tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The re­view model’s black peb­ble­shaped charg­ing case has a USB-C port at its rear for charg­ing and sup­ports wire­less charg­ing. How­ever, its LED charg­ing in­di­ca­tor is inside the case. So, you have to lift the lid to check the charg­ing progress.</p>
    <p>The diminu­tive case has j ust about enough space to hold the two ear­buds, which are also on the small side. The ear­buds have a rather unique de­sign — an ir­reg­u­lar­shaped tri­an­gu­lar stem hangs out of the oval body of each ear­bud. On each stem is a tiny touch-sen­si­tive Li­bra­tone logo.</p>
    <p>The stems rest nicely on my ear lobes to “an­chor” the ear­buds se­curely in place. They could be an is­sue for those who wear ear­rings, though.</p>
    <p>Four pairs of ear tips are in­cluded, so you should be able to find a pair that fits. With the right-sized ear tips, the ear­buds should not fall out eas­ily.</p>
    <p>I find the ear­buds com­fort­able to wear and so light­weight I barely no­tice them even when wear­ing them for long pe­ri­ods. With an IPX4 rat­ing, the ear­buds are re­sis­tant to sweat and water splashes. But do not run with them in a heavy down­pour.</p>
    <p>You can use the Li­bra­tone app (avail­able on An­droid and iOS) to help you pair the Track Air+ with your mo­bile de­vice. Once paired, the app al­lows you to cus­tomise the double- and triple-tap func­tions of the ear­buds, as well as ad­just the ANC (to man­ual or au­to­matic) and choose your pre­ferred equaliser set­ting from Neu­tral, Ex­tra Bass and En­hanced Tre­ble.</p>
    <p>I like that I can freely choose what func­tions to ex­e­cute with the double- and triple-tap ac­tions. For in­stance, I des­ig­nated ANC switch­ing (double-tap) and voice as­sis­tant (triple-tap) to the left ear­bud, and the play/pause and next track mu­sic con­trols to the right ear­bud. This way, I will not get con­fused with the con­trols.</p>
    <p>De­spite the ear­buds’ small stature, their au­dio out­put is su­perb, es­pe­cially at the Ex­tra Bass set­ting. The bass is punchy, while the mids are clear and the highs are crisp. I also find the en­tire au­di­ble spec­trum rich with details.</p>
    <p>On the down­side, you can­not man­u­ally ad­just the equaliser set­ting. You are stuck with the three pre­sets.</p>
    <p>I like that the mu­sic pauses only when I re­move both ear­buds, as some­times, I just want to take one ear­bud out to talk to some­one, but not pause the mu­sic. How­ever, the mu­sic play­back re­sumes when you put one ear­bud back in.</p>
    <p>In terms of ANC per­for­mance, the Track Air+ is not as ef­fec­tive as Sony’s WF-1000XM3 or Ap­ple’s AirPods Pro. But it is no slouch, able to fil­ter out most of the am­bi­ent noise when man­u­ally set to max­i­mum. It is prob­a­bly com­pa­ra­ble to the Sennheiser Mo­men­tum True Wire­less 2, which I re­viewed re­cently.</p>
    <p>When set to au­to­matic, the ANC will mea­sure the am­bi­ent noise and set the ANC level ac­cord­ingly. But I find this mode in­ad­e­quate when I want max­i­mum fil­ter­ing.</p>
    <p>If you are jog­ging and want to be aware of your sur­round­ings, there is an am­bi­ent mon­i­tor­ing mode that lets in most of the am­bi­ent noise.</p>
    <p>Bat­tery life is pretty good, at up to six hours of mu­sic play­back on a full charge. The charg­ing case al­lows for an­other 18 hours. In my tests, I found the bat­tery life drop­ping to 55 per cent af­ter three hours of play­back.</p>
    <p>The Track Air+ is not cheap, with its $349 price tag com­pa­ra­ble to that of genre lead­ers Ap­ple AirPods Pro ($379) and Sony WF-1000XM3 ($349).</p>
    <p>But it is a good choice if you want a pair of true wire­less in-ear head­phones that has a unique de­sign with great sound and ANC.</p>
