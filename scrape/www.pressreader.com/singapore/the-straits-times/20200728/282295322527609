    <p>7</p>
    <p>The Reds sealed the ti­tle with seven games to spare, eclips­ing Manchester United (2000-01) and Manchester City (2017-18) who won their ti­tles with five games left.</p>
    <p>8</p>
    <p>Liver­pool be­came the first team to win the league in eight dif­fer­ent decades – 1900s, 1920s, 1940s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2020s.</p>
    <p>32</p>
    <p>Their 3-1 vic­tory against New­cas­tle United was their 32nd win of the sea­son, equalling City for most vic­to­ries in a league cam­paign. They also set a new club record of 14 away wins in a sea­son.</p>
    <p>24</p>
    <p>The 2-0 win on July 5 over As­ton Villa ex­tended their record of suc­ces­sive home wins in the league to 24. The pre­vi­ous record was City’s mark of 20.</p>
    <p>18</p>
    <p>When they beat West Ham United in Fe­bru­ary it was their 18th con­sec­u­tive league win, equalling Manchester City’s record.</p>
    <p>25</p>
    <p>They beat Southamp­ton 4-0 on Feb 1 to move 22 points clear of City at the top of the ta­ble for the big­gest lead in Premier League his­tory. That grew to a record 25 points af­ter a 1-0 vic­tory against Nor­wich City later that month.</p>
    <p>61</p>
    <p>Their 1-0 win at Tot­ten­ham on Jan 11 put them on 61 points – the most in any of Europe’s “Big Five” leagues af­ter the first 21 games.</p>
    <p>19</p>
    <p>Liver­pool’s 2-0 vic­tory against West Ham on Jan 29 marked the first time they had de­feated ev­ery team in a sin­gle top-flight cam­paign in the club’s 127-year his­tory.</p>
    <p>18</p>
    <p>The Mersey­side club won 18 of their 19 games at An­field, match­ing the achieve­ments of Chelsea (2005-06), City (2011–12, 2018–19) and United (2010-11). They drew with Burn­ley.</p>
