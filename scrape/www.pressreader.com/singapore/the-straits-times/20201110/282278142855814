    <p>Buy­ing chicken rice at a hawker cen­tre with­out cash was pre­vi­ously un­heard of, but now, cus­tomers can sim­ply scan QR codes with their phones to pay.</p>
    <p>The in­creas­ingly wide­spread use of e-pay­ments – from buy­ing hawker food to shopping on­line – has given a boost to some com­pa­nies amid the dig­i­tal push ac­cel­er­ated by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>E-pay­ments, mo­bile wal­lets and e-com­merce com­pa­nies told The Straits Times they have ac­quired more users in re­cent months, and are fur­ther ex­pand­ing their reach through new part­ner­ships and a wider va­ri­ety of ser­vices.</p>
    <p>DBS PayLah, one of the larger mo­bile wal­lets in Sin­ga­pore with more than 1.7 mil­lion users, saw over 20 per cent more new user sign-ups year on year in the third quar­ter of this year.</p>
    <p>DBS Bank’s head of pay­ments and plat­forms An­thony Seow said: “Con­sumers are now more con­scious of per­sonal hy­giene, and con­tact­less pay­ments have been very strong in places that pre­vi­ously pre­dom­i­nantly used cash.”</p>
    <p>Mer­chants have also found their foot traf­fic hit by the pan­demic, and as a re­sult, have re­alised that they need to go dig­i­tal to boost sales, Mr Seow added.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, DBS PayLah part­nered mo­bile pay­ment and deals plat­form Fave, adding 12,000 Fave-part­nered mer­chants to its ex­ist­ing net­work of more than 170,000. The part­ner­ship al­lows users to scan FavePay QR codes to pay via PayLah and re­ceive up to 20 per cent cashback from FavePay.</p>
    <p>Fave also has a sim­i­lar part­ner­ship with Sing­tel’s mo­bile wal­let Dash.</p>
    <p>DBS is also in­te­grat­ing its DBS Life­style re­wards app into the PayLah app, which lets more than 3.3 mil­lion DBS and POSB card­hold­ers ac­cess per­son­alised deals and con­duct trans­ac­tions on a sin­gle app.</p>
    <p>Mr Seow said th­ese ini­tia­tives have helped put the mo­bile wal­let on track to hit­ting its tar­get of 3.5 mil­lion users by 2023.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has one part to play, but we also keep adding places for con­sumers to scan and pay. Con­sumers like the va­ri­ety and when you have more users, mer­chants want to be part of the plat­form.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Fave has added more than 2,000 FavePay lo­ca­tions and Fave deals this year. The plat­form, which now has more than 12,000 FavePay lo­ca­tions, hopes to add an­other 8,000 by next year. It has also gained more than 100,000 new users in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng Aik-Phong, man­ag­ing direc­tor of Fave Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia, said peo­ple want to stretch their dol­lar amid the on­go­ing eco­nomic un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>He ex­pects an in­crease in part­ner­ships among dig­i­tal pay­ment plat­forms, as this al­lows firms to tap one an­other’s strengths and re­duce costs. “Per­ceived com­peti­tors are go­ing to work to­gether. It’s about cre­at­ing an ecosys­tem, rather than build­ing ev­ery­thing your­self.”</p>
    <p>In June, Dash col­lab­o­rated with Etiqa In­sur­ance to launch dig­i­tal in­sur­ance sav­ings plan Dash EasyEarn for Dash users. The plan has chalked up more than $100 mil­lion in as­sets un­der man­age­ment, partly due to an “at­trac­tive re­turn” of 2 per cent per an­num amid a low in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment, said Mr Gilbert Chuah, head of mo­bile fi­nan­cial ser­vices at Sing­tel’s In­ter­na­tional Group.</p>
    <p>Mr Chuah said: “We are con­tin­u­ing this mo­men­tum for Dash as we ex­pand the mo­bile fi­nan­cial ser­vices of­fer­ings in the com­ing year.”</p>
    <p>Dash al­lows users to re­mit money and pay for com­mutes with their phones, among other ser­vices. It has seen a more than 40 per cent rise in monthly ac­tive users since the start of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It is also work­ing with travel part­ners to en­able in-wal­let pur­chases of tick­ets for lo­cal at­trac­tions, in an­tic­i­pa­tion of travel re­stric­tions be­ing lifted.</p>
    <p>A Grab spokesman said de­mand for dig­i­tal ser­vices and de­liv­er­ies re­mains high, even af­ter the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod as peo­ple tele­work and con­sume ser­vices and en­ter­tain­ment on­line.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, Grab helped small and medium-sized en­ter­prises with­out e-com­merce sites and dig­i­tal pay­ment in­fra­struc­ture to set up a re­mote pay­ment link that their cus­tomers could use to make pay­ments via so­cial me­dia and mes­sag­ing apps. More than 2,500 of Grab’s part­ner mer­chants used the fea­ture within a few weeks of its launch, said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>United Over­seas Bank said its card­mem­bers’ spend­ing on pur­chases on­line surged 110 per cent year on year in the sec­ond and third quar­ters of this year.</p>
    <p>Last month, the bank part­nered Shopee to of­fer UOB One Credit Card mem­bers ex­clu­sive deals and cash re­bates of up to 10 per cent for pur­chases charged to the card.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve trans­ac­tions will con­tinue to grow on the back of our col­lab­o­ra­tion with Shopee, and as e-com­merce cam­paigns such as 11.11 and Black Fri­day are ex­pected to draw in more cus­tomers look­ing for value as they shop on­line,” said Ms Jacque­lyn Tan, UOB’s head of group per­sonal fi­nan­cial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>E-com­merce plat­forms have also gained more trac­tion due to higher spend­ing on­line.</p>
    <p>Lazada Sin­ga­pore’s chief ex­ec­u­tive James Chang said: “This is an atyp­i­cal year since nor­mally, sales and vis­i­tor records are bro­ken dur­ing peak sale months like Novem­ber due to Sin­gles’ Day, but June bucked the trend by achiev­ing new highs in sales, fol­lowed by Septem­ber where we had the high­est vis­its to the site and app in the his­tory of Lazada Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>In July, Ma­rina Square be­came the first shopping mall to join Lazada, work­ing with its ten­ants to cre­ate a vir­tual mall on the app.</p>
    <p>Lazada Sin­ga­pore also cre­ated a way for mer­chants to sell eVouch­ers on its plat­form, which can be re­deemed phys­i­cally to drive foot traf­fic to their stores.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Shopee said it has ob­served a 70 per cent in­crease in brands open­ing of­fi­cial stores on Shopee Mall, said its chief commercial of­fi­cer Zhou Jun­jie.</p>
    <p>It also part­nered Cap­i­taLand last month to launch the Cap­i­taLand x Shopee 11.11 cam­paign that in­te­grates on­line and off­line shop­per en­gage­ment to drive sales, traf­fic and en­gage­ment for six Cap­i­taLand malls through gam­i­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Ama­zon, which launched its Sin­ga­pore web­site last year, saw more than 12,000 small and medium-sized en­ter­prises par­tic­i­pate for the first time in Prime Day – a two-day an­nual sale last month for Ama­zon Prime mem­bers.</p>
    <p>The e-com­merce land­scape is an in­creas­ingly chal­leng­ing one for on­line mer­chants, who need to nav­i­gate rapidly chang­ing con­sumer be­hav­iour, man­age de­mand fluc­tu­a­tions and sup­ply chain dis­rup­tions, and en­sure a healthy cash flow, said Mr Phil Pom­ford, gen­eral man­ager of global e-com­merce for mer­chant and pay­ments tech­nol­ogy so­lu­tions firm World­pay from FIS.</p>
    <p>“To stay com­pet­i­tive, on­line mer­chants are look­ing for es­tab­lished and trusted part­ners who can help op­ti­mise the pay­ments jour­neys to take ad­van­tage of new op­por­tu­ni­ties.”</p>
