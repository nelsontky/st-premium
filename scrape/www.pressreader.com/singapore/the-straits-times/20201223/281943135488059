    <p>We’re just one week from the end of 2020 and mirac­u­lously, the days of iso­la­tion dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker that lasted through much of April and all of May now seem to me like a dis­tant past.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren went back to school, peo­ple are back in restau­rants and toi­let pa­per is back on su­per­mar­ket shelves.</p>
    <p>The way Sin­ga­pore has bounced back is surely worth cel­e­brat­ing.</p>
    <p>But we are not out of the woods yet. Many coun­tries are fight­ing fresh waves of the Covid-19 pan­demic, and we must keep our masks on and keep a safe dis­tance from one an­other, even as we mix and min­gle in larger groups of eight.</p>
    <p>Still, it’s worth paus­ing to re­flect on the les­sons in re­silience this year has yielded. And to re­mem­ber those who are still strug­gling to get back on their feet.</p>
    <p>DOWN BUT NOT OUT</p>
    <p>Down but not out was the ti­tle of a re­cent speech by Mr Ravi Menon, in which he spoke about re­silience in a post-Covid-19 world.</p>
    <p>The manag­ing di­rec­tor of the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore quoted boxer Rocky Bal­boa, pro­tag­o­nist of the Rocky movies that starred Sylvester Stal­lone, and said: “Re­silience is about get­ting back up again even af­ter be­ing knocked down... and to keep mov­ing for­ward.”</p>
    <p>That is what Sin­ga­pore is do­ing, by bub­ble-wrap­ping travel and gear­ing up to host the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum next May.</p>
    <p>No coun­try can move for­ward from a pub­lic health cri­sis if its health sys­tem breaks down. Sin­ga­pore’s did not.</p>
    <p>I got a glimpse of be­hind-the-scenes mea­sures to sup­port health­care work­ers when I spoke to a cousin who had been posted to the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Diseases dur­ing a surge in in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>She said she was kit­ted out not just in per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment (PPE) but also work clothes that she would shed at the end of each shift at the hospi­tal, where she would also shower be­fore head­ing home.</p>
    <p>I mar­velled at this sys­tem, which saved health­care work­ers the headache of hav­ing to mark out a “dirty” zone in their own homes</p>
    <p>and sep­a­rately laun­der their work clothes that might have been con­tam­i­nated, a bur­den some nurses over­seas shoul­dered while work­ing long hours.</p>
    <p>That was just one mea­sure among many that kept the health­care sys­tem re­silient.</p>
    <p>In an ar­ti­cle pub­lished by on­line jour­nal BMJ Global Health, ex­perts from the Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health de­scribed a na­tional strat­egy that stretched from the clear com­mu­ni­ca­tion of risks and the con­tain­ment of Covid-19 spread, to stock­pil­ing PPE, mo­bil­is­ing man­power for out­break re­sponse and fi­nan­cial sup­port for those in­fected and on quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>This en­tire in­fra­struc­ture was what sus­tained doc­tors and nurses fight­ing at the front line against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Where such sup­port is lack­ing, ex­hausted health­care work­ers may feel they have no choice but to quit, as large num­bers are do­ing in Swe­den. That’s when a health­care sys­tem breaks down.</p>
    <p>“Many as­pects of re­silience are lim­ited but they’re re­new­able,” says Pro­fes­sor Ann Mas­ten of the Univer­sity of Min­nesota, who stud­ies re­silience in hu­man devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“Our re­silience is al­ways chang­ing. For ex­am­ple, if you don’t feel well, you won’t have as much re­silience as when you do.</p>
    <p>“If you don’t get enough sleep, you won’t have as much re­silience and so forth,” she ex­plains in an in­ter­view with the Amer­i­can Psy­cho­log­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“Just like our im­mune sys­tem un­der dif­fi­cult cir­cum­stances, we do have the ca­pac­ity, as par­ents and peo­ple, to surge.</p>
    <p>“We do have surge ca­pac­ity, but that may be tem­po­rary. We can get de­pleted.</p>
    <p>“Day af­ter day af­ter day, if you are work­ing hard to deal with chal­leng­ing things, you can sim­ply get ex­hausted and over­whelmed, and then we need to step back and try to re­plen­ish and re­store our ca­pac­ity.”</p>
    <p>WHEN PEO­PLE STRUG­GLE</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s whole-of-na­tion ap­proach to fight­ing Covid-19 is a model for how we need to sup­port peo­ple still strug­gling to get back on their feet.</p>
    <p>We need a whole-per­son ap­proach that pays at­ten­tion to the range of per­sonal, so­cial and in­sti­tu­tional fac­tors that af­fect how well some­one deals with tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial aid, such as the new Covid-19 Re­cov­ery Grant for lower- and mid­dle-in­come work­ers still deal­ing with job or in­come losses, helps.</p>
    <p>But money alone is not enough to sup­port peo­ple through change.</p>
    <p>They also need other re­sources, such as in­for­ma­tion, guid­ance, emo­tional sup­port and cop­ing strate­gies.</p>
    <p>Dr Nancy Schloss­berg’s 4-S model of tran­si­tion, widely used in the field of ca­reer devel­op­ment, pro­vides a use­ful frame­work for mea­sur­ing how well equipped a per­son is to deal with tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>The four S’s are Sit­u­a­tion, Self, Sup­port and Strate­gies.</p>
    <p>Sit­u­a­tion refers to the trig­gers for the tran­si­tion, and other stres­sors or past ex­pe­ri­ences at the point of change that may hurt or help.</p>
    <p>Self refers to a per­son’s so­cio-eco­nomic sta­tus, gen­der, age, state of health and psy­cho-so­cial re­sources – such as out­look or spir­i­tu­al­ity – that have a bear­ing on one’s abil­ity to cope.</p>
    <p>Sup­port refers to fam­ily, friends or a com­mu­nity that can pro­vide the love, ac­cep­tance, sense of self-es­teem and guid­ance a per­son needs.</p>
    <p>Strate­gies re­fer to ways of cop­ing, such as re­fram­ing to give a sense of mean­ing or con­trol.</p>
    <p>Be­fore a tran­si­tion, a per­son’s life is pretty or­gan­ised into cer­tain roles, re­la­tion­ships, rou­tines and as­sump­tions, says Dr Schloss­berg in an in­ter­view avail­able on YouTube.</p>
    <p>Then, you en­ter a “never-never land that can last from six months to six years”, un­til you get a new life and es­tab­lish a new set of roles, re­la­tion­ships, rou­tines and as­sump­tions.</p>
    <p>“But what makes the dif­fer­ence,” she says, “in how you ne­go­ti­ate this murky mid­dle pe­riod are the four S’s. Those are your po­ten­tial re­sources for deal­ing with the tran­si­tion.”</p>
    <p>You can have 50 peo­ple in a room all hav­ing the same tran­si­tion, she adds, but each is han­dling it dif­fer­ently.</p>
    <p>That is what we need to re­mem­ber when help­ing peo­ple through tran­si­tions, whether they be se­niors deal­ing with re­tire­ment, mid-ca­reer folk fac­ing job losses or fresh grad­u­ates en­ter­ing a tough job mar­ket.</p>
    <p>We need to adopt a whole-per­son ap­proach and help each of them find or grow the re­sources they need to cope.</p>
    <p>Dr Schloss­berg cited a con­crete ex­am­ple of such help: The</p>
    <p>Na­tional Aero­nau­tics and Space Ad­min­is­tra­tion paired 55 peo­ple it re­trenched with a buddy each from its hu­man re­source depart­ment, to sup­port them un­til they found new jobs.</p>
    <p>Here in Sin­ga­pore, char­ity We Care Com­mu­nity Ser­vices adopts a whole-per­son ap­proach to help re­cov­er­ing ad­dicts.</p>
    <p>Its RiSE pro­gramme – which I vol­un­teer with as a ca­reer coach – is sup­ported by the Pres­i­dent’s Chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>As its name sug­gests, RiSE helps for­mer ad­dicts re­cover and in­te­grate into so­ci­ety through em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one in the pro­gramme is sup­ported by a coun­sel­lor, a re­cov­ery guide and a ca­reer coach.</p>
    <p>This is labour-in­ten­sive work that some may re­gard as in­ef­fi­cient. But if we can help a per­son bounce back in­stead of let­ting him sink into de­spair, that out­come is surely price­less.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the depths of the Covid-19 out­break, we found ways to let health­care work­ers know they were not alone.</p>
    <p>We need to do the same for those who con­tinue to grap­ple with dif­fi­cult tran­si­tions.</p>
    <p>That gives peo­ple a chance to re­new their re­silience.</p>
