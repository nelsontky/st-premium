    <p>One month into the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, I had to ad­mit that my weigh­ing scale was telling me the stark truth. Hours of munch­ing by the lap­top while cooped up in­doors had caught up with me.</p>
    <p>The dig­i­tal na­tive that I am, I im­me­di­ately turned to the</p>
    <p>In­ter­net gods for help to get back in shape and was re­warded with lean-meal choices on Grab­Food and home work­out rental equip­ment list­ings on Carousell.</p>
    <p>As de­liv­ery and dis­in­fec­tion were guar­an­teed, I chose to rent work­out items on Carousell, in­clud­ing dumb-bells, re­sis­tance tubes and a bal­ance ball for about $40, re­lieved that I had the op­tion to re­turn the bulky load or ex­tend my use of it if I wanted.</p>
    <p>Con­trary to the omi­nous pre­dic­tions by mar­ket watch­ers of the shar­ing econ­omy’s near-to­tal col­lapse, cap­tured in Bloomberg Busi­ness­week (“The shar­ing econ­omy faces the abyss”, March 20) and other re­ports, the shar­ing econ­omy seems to have ex­tended its reach to and in­flu­ence on mil­len­ni­als this year.</p>
    <p>A 2015 PwC study termed the shar­ing econ­omy as a model where users share their idle ca­pac­i­ties and re­sources (as­sets, ser­vices, money) on an on-de­mand ba­sis, usu­ally through an in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy plat­form.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal shar­ing plat­forms are not new, hav­ing mush­roomed in Sin­ga­pore and glob­ally in the last decade.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic health reg­u­la­tions im­posed dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic have crys­tallised the ap­peal of th­ese com­pa­nies to users – in par­tic­u­lar, work­ing mil­len­ni­als – who are at­tracted to the con­ve­nience and door-to-door ef­fi­ciency th­ese plat­forms prom­ise.</p>
    <p>Twenty out of 22 mil­len­ni­als I con­tacted said they had fre­quented a shar­ing-based dig­i­tal plat­form more since the start of the pan­demic. Some said th­ese plat­forms gave them a sense of con­trol in the early days when Covid-19 cases were ris­ing.</p>
    <p>One friend said she liked to book an af­ford­able short Grab ride in­stead of fac­ing the rush hour pub­lic com­mute and fear of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>An­other shared that he opted for a de­liv­ery of rental props for a fam­ily birth­day party in­stead of go­ing out to buy them him­self.</p>
    <p>Younger con­sumers are more likely to use dig­i­tal plat­forms than older ones as we tend to trust peers we in­ter­act with in this space. This need for trust has be­come all the more ev­i­dent dur­ing a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Like how staff in es­tab­lish­ments are ex­pected to main­tain prod­uct and ser­vice stan­dards; in the shar­ing econ­omy, we ex­pect a car owner to keep her car clean or an Airbnb op­er­a­tor to thor­oughly sani­tise his res­i­dence be­fore we book in for the night.</p>
    <p>As dig­i­tal na­tives, we un­der­stand the power of on­line rep­u­ta­tion. Give a user a poor ex­pe­ri­ence, and he will be quick to write you a bad re­view. In this way, checks and bal­ances are main­tained, mak­ing for richer user ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>Be­sides con­ve­nience and trust, mil­len­ni­als also favour ac­cess over own­er­ship. Grow­ing up in the shadow of the 2008 fi­nan­cial cri­sis, we have a de­sire for ex­pe­ri­ences, and pre­fer us­ing some­thing rather than own­ing it.</p>
    <p>So I once signed up for a Style The­ory sub­scrip­tion – a clothes-rental ser­vice. Each month, a pack of three pieces of cloth­ing I chose on its easy-to-use app would be de­liv­ered, nes­tled in tis­sue pa­per. I re­turned the clothes worn and un­laun­dered, as the ser­vice would have them cleaned be­fore send­ing them on to the next hirer.</p>
    <p>I en­joyed the fresh-pressed, tai­lored cut and fab­ric of each piece that I would other­wise have had to spend a small for­tune on. My monthly pack­age cost me $59, and saved me time and ef­fort.</p>
    <p>When I de­cided to stop af­ter two months, all it took was a few taps and clicks on the app to be free of the com­mit­ment. I had found ac­cess to high-end ap­parel at a rea­son­able price, with­out ever own­ing one piece.</p>
    <p>My ex­pe­ri­ence with rental cloth­ing high­lights the last and per­haps most im­por­tant fea­ture of the shar­ing econ­omy: sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Mil­len­ni­als have been bom­barded with grim facts and fig­ures threat­en­ing ir­re­versible cli­mate change if we do not switch to sus­tain­able mod­els in nearly all as­pects of our ev­ery­day life.</p>
    <p>With more Sin­ga­porean con­sumers pay­ing at­ten­tion to their car­bon foot­print, the shar­ing econ­omy will con­tinue to grow as an at­trac­tive al­ter­na­tive to own­er­ship.</p>
    <p>While Covid-19 has led many to turn to shar­ing op­tions, Pro­fes­sor Costas Cour­cou­betis from the Sin­ga­pore Uni­ver­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign pointed out that Covid-19 has af­fected com­pa­nies within the shar­ing econ­omy dif­fer­ently.</p>
    <p>Those de­liv­er­ing gro­ceries or take­away food, or in­volved in stor­age or lo­gis­tics, have done bet­ter be­cause they pro­vide ser­vices that are in greater de­mand while peo­ple are stay­ing home and iso­lat­ing, lim­it­ing the time they spend out­side and their in­ter­ac­tions with oth­ers.</p>
    <p>In sec­tors reel­ing from the pan­demic as peo­ple cut back on travel and trans­port, com­pa­nies of­fer­ing shar­ing ser­vices are do­ing bet­ter than their tra­di­tional coun­ter­parts.</p>
    <p>Said Prof Cour­cou­betis: “At a time when busi­ness is down by 80 per cent, Uber and Airbnb’s lay­offs rep­re­sented only about 25 per cent of each com­pany’s full-time em­ployee base.”</p>
    <p>For con­sumers, th­ese mul­ti­ple plat­forms have be­come an in­te­gral part of our lives dur­ing the last few months, and while we would be sad to see some of them go, we will be quick to snap up their re­place­ments.</p>
    <p>With Deep­avali around the cor­ner, I have my sights set on a shar­ing app that al­lows use­ful but un­wanted items to change hands be­tween users: Olio.</p>
    <p>With no large, happy fam­ily gath­er­ings in sight, gifts of choco­late and un­used tea boxes are wast­ing away in my kitchen. Maybe my sur­plus food list­ing on the app might be just the right treat to make some­one else’s day a bit bet­ter dur­ing this pan­demic.</p>
