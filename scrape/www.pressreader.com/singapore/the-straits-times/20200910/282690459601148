    <p>Hong Kong di­rec­tor Ann Hui has de­scribed her “fan­tas­tic strug­gle” to make her new film, Love Af­ter Love, as anti-gov­ern­ment protests broke out in the ter­ri­tory and then the coro­n­avirus pan­demic all but halted travel.</p>
    <p>Hui, 73, was awarded a Golden Lion award for Life­time Achieve­ment by the Venice Film Fes­ti­val on Tues­day. Mr Al­berto Bar­bera, the fes­ti­val’s di­rec­tor, called her “one of Asia’s most re­spected, pro­lific and ver­sa­tile direc­tors”.</p>
    <p>Her new film is a tale of tor­tu­ous love and moral de­prav­ity within Hong Kong’s high so­ci­ety be­fore World War II. Based on a short story by the l ate writer Eileen Chang, it cen­tres on a young Shang­hai school­girl who seeks help from a wealthy aunt.</p>
    <p>Mov­ing in with the tem­per­a­men­tal and dis­il­lu­sioned for­mer con­cu­bine, she gets sucked i nto her world of fancy par­ties and am­bigu­ous re­la­tions with rich, older men. She then falls i n l ove with a trou­bled play­boy.</p>
    <p>“When we first fin­ished shoot­ing, the protest move­ment in Hong Kong started... every day we were hear­ing the tear gas from down­stairs and we could even smell it. I had to re­turn home every night through the sub­way,” Hui said.</p>
    <p>Af­ter five months of work­ing through the protests, the pan­demic then com­pli­cated post-pro­duc­tion work, leav­ing the team re­ly­ing on Zoom meet­ings.</p>
    <p>“We’ve hardly met and we’ve done it and it was, how to call it, fan­tas­tic strug­gle,” she said.</p>
    <p>“It’s a kind of a mov­ing ex­am­ple of how film peo­ple work re­gard­less of cross­fires and ev­ery­thing and we’ve tried our best to make the film de­spite great dif­fi­cul­ties.”</p>
    <p>Hui has di­rected al­most 30 fea­ture films in­clud­ing Boat Peo­ple (1982), A Sim­ple Life (2011) and The Golden Era (2014).</p>
    <p>Mr Bar­bera said Hui re­counts with sen­si­tiv­ity “in­di­vid­ual sto­ries that in­ter­weave with im­por­tant so­cial themes, such as those of refugees, the marginalis­ed and the el­derly”.</p>
    <p>Hui said she wanted to leave it to her work to con­vey her po­lit­i­cal views.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s bet­ter for me not to com­ment too much on the sit­u­a­tion be­cause this film is in­vested by Chi­nese com­pa­nies,” she said.</p>
    <p>“They have al­lowed us to shoot this movie with im­mense moral com­plex­ity and it has passed cen­sor­ship with very mi­nor cuts.”</p>
