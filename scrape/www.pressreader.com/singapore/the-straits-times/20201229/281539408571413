    <p>A two-storey house in Cen­tral Java used by the Je­maah Is­lamiah (JI) ter­ror­ist net­work to train re­cruits in han­dling weapons and as­sem­bling bombs for seven years un­til 2018 has been un­cov­ered by the In­done­sian au­thor­i­ties. At least 96 young mil­i­tants were trained at the cen­tre, with many of them sent to Syria to fight.</p>
    <p>It was used to teach re­cruits for seven years, and is one of 12 ter­ror­ist train­ing sites found in In­done­sian province</p>
    <p>A two-storey house in Cen­tral Java used by the Je­maah Is­lamiah (JI) ter­ror­ist net­work to train re­cruits in han­dling weapons and as­sem­bling bombs for seven years un­til 2018 has been un­cov­ered by the In­done­sian au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Re­cruits at the fenced-in villa in Gin­tun­gan vil­lage in Se­marang re­gency were in­ducted by se­nior mil­i­tant Joko Priy­ono, alias Karso, un­der the in­struc­tions of Para Wi­jayanto, the leader of JI, the group be­hind the Bali bomb­ings in 2002 that killed 202 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Both Karso and Para are cur­rently be­hind bars after be­ing con­victed of ter­ror­ist ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>At least 96 young mil­i­tants un­der­went six months of train­ing at the Gin­tun­gan house, with many of them sent to Syria to fight along­side ter­ror group Jab­hat al-Nusra, or Al-Nusra Front. The group was known as an Al-Qaeda off­shoot be­hind de­cap­i­ta­tions and mur­ders in Syria and Le­banon.</p>
    <p>The discovery of the house and its dark his­tory be­tween 2011 and 2018 was made by In­done­sia’s anti-ter­ror­ism squad, Den­sus 88, amid on­go­ing op­er­a­tions against ter­ror­ists since the 2002 Bali bomb­ings.</p>
    <p>Den­sus 88 in­ten­si­fied its ef­forts against ter­ror­ism re­cently after an at­tack that killed four mem­bers of a Chris­tian fam­ily in a re­mote vil­lage in Cen­tral Su­lawesi late last month.</p>
    <p>In the same month, an­other key plot­ter in the Bali bomb­ings, Tau­fik Bu­laga, alias Upik Lawanga, was ar­rested by the po­lice.</p>
    <p>And ear­lier this month, the po­lice ar­rested a man who was in­volved in the bomb­ings as well as the sui­cide bomb­ing at Jakarta’s Mar­riott Ho­tel that killed 12 peo­ple in 2003 – Aris Su­mar­sono, also known as Zulka­r­naen.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Po­lice spokesman, In­spec­tor-Gen­eral Argo Yuwono, said on Mon­day that the Gin­tun­gan house is one of 12 ter­ror­ist train­ing sites that were dis­cov­ered by Den­sus 88 across Cen­tral Java province.</p>
    <p>“Eight train­ers were re­cruited (by Karso) to train stu­dents from his net­work of Is­lamic board­ing schools,” Insp-Gen Argo told re­porters.</p>
    <p>The pri­vately owned villa is cur­rently empty and un­der ren­o­va­tion, ac­cord­ing to lo­cal me­dia re­ports.</p>
    <p>Para was sen­tenced by a Jakarta court to seven years’ jail in July this year for his role in re­cruit­ing, train­ing and rais­ing funds for In­done­sian mil­i­tants go­ing to Syria.</p>
    <p>Karso was ar­rested last year and is serv­ing a jail sen­tence of nearly four years.</p>
    <p>Insp-Gen Argo said that of the 96 re­cruits, 66 made their way into Syria while the rest were ar­rested by In­done­sian po­lice.</p>
    <p>“In Syria, they were trained to de­ploy firearms – ri­fles and guns – to as­sem­ble bombs. They were trained be­fore join­ing the real war there,” he said.</p>
    <p>He noted that a num­ber of those ar­riv­ing in Syria died there, while oth­ers who re­turned to In­done­sia were ar­rested and jailed, came un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion or are still be­ing hunted by the po­lice.</p>
