    <p>BEI­JING • Chi­nese an­i­mated fea­ture Jiang Ziya: Leg­end Of Deifi­ca­tion is set to hit the big screens in China on Oct 1, the be­gin­ning of the coun­try’s Na­tional Day Golden Week hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>The long-awaited movie was orig­i­nally sched­uled to be re­leased on Jan 25, the first day of Chi­nese New Year, but it was post­poned due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Other films that were set to open dur­ing the Chi­nese New Year hol­i­days but were held over in­cluded De­tec­tive Chi­na­town 3, the third in­stal­ment of one of China’s most com­mer­cially suc­cess­ful come­dies; and Leap, based on the true story of the Chi­nese women’s vol­ley­ball team.</p>
    <p>Leap, which stars Gong Li and Huang Bo, is sched­uled to open on Sept 30, the eve of China’s Na­tional Day.</p>
    <p>Leg­end Of Deifi­ca­tion, which tells the story of mytho­log­i­cal fig­ure Jiang Ziya, is from the com­pa­nies be­hind last year’s China box­of­fice cham­pion Ne Zha.</p>
    <p>Jiang is a wise strate­gist from the novel The In­vesti­ture Of The Gods, a Ming dy­nasty (1368 to 1644) book that in­spired Ne Zha, the Chi­nese film about its epony­mous hero.</p>
    <p>Ne Zha, co-pro­duced by Bei­jing En­light Pic­tures, topped China’s box-of­fice chart last year, gross­ing more than five bil­lion yuan (S$990 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment came as China’s film in­dus­try is grad­u­ally re­cov­er­ing from the pan­demic, with more movie theatres al­lowed to re­open after months-long clo­sures.</p>
    <p>Block­busters such as di­rec­tor Christo­pher Nolan’s lat­est sci-fi ac­tion fea­ture film, Tenet, are also set to be screened in China’s cin­e­mas soon.</p>
