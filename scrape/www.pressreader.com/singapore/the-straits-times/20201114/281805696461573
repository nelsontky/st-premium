    <p>Malaysia’s largest bud­get, un­veiled last week, came with big prom­ises to ease pub­lic pain amid the Covid-19 night­mare, but crit­i­cisms of its lim­i­ta­tions have been com­ing in fast and fu­ri­ous.</p>
    <p>While politi­cians crit­i­cised a pro­posed large out­lay to re­vive a gov­ern­ment pro­pa­ganda unit and push for blan­ket bank loan mora­to­ri­ums, the pub­lic sees nuggets of aid com­ing their way but also the lack of a com­pre­hen­sive safety net for the most vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>The RM322.5 bil­lion (S$105.4 bil­lion) Bud­get 2021 is 2.5 per cent more than this year’s ex­pen­di­ture, de­spite sev­eral stim­u­lus pack­ages al­ready rolled out this year by the Muhyid­din Yassin ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Malaysians hit hard by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic are hop­ing that some of the prom­ises in next year’s bud­get will help them keep their fi­nances above wa­ter.</p>
    <p>Madam Hafizah Husni, 38, a cleaner and sin­gle mother of three, said that with her earn­ings cut due to fewer jobs be­ing avail­able, she can no longer pay for child­care when she does go out to work.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment said it would spend RM20 mil­lion to set up child­care cen­tres for lower-in­come fam­i­lies, and Madam Hafizah, who falls into the bot­tom 40 per cent of Malaysia’s in­come earn­ers, or B40, hopes that this means she will be able to breathe a lit­tle eas­ier.</p>
    <p>“I worry a lot about my chil­dren’s safety – they have to take care of them­selves alone at home. This would re­ally put my mind at ease,” she told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Fi­nance Min­is­ter Tengku Zafrul Aziz, who un­veiled the bud­get on Nov 6, said that a raft of mea­sures is aimed at the B40 and the mid­dle 40 per cent of earn­ers, or M40.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment needs to move fast, as nearly 32,500 com­pa­nies reg­is­tered un­der the Com­pa­nies Com­mis­sion of Malaysia, the ma­jor­ity of them be­ing mi­cro-en­trepreneur­s, have folded since March, when move­ment curbs were first im­ple­mented.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Tengku Zafrul on Thurs­day de­fended the bud­get, say­ing the B40 group is en­ti­tled to an au­to­matic bank loan mora­to­rium for three months, or they could re­duce monthly in­stal­ment pay­ments for their loans by 50 per cent for six months.</p>
    <p>The M40 group would be of­fered bank loan re­pay­ment as­sis­tance if their in­comes have been cut.</p>
    <p>With th­ese groups in mind, the gov­ern­ment will also al­lo­cate RM3.7 bil­lion to create 500,000 job op­por­tu­ni­ties through hir­ing in­cen­tives, re­train­ing pro­grammes and wage sub­si­dies.</p>
    <p>Reskilling and up­skilling pro­grammes are ex­pected to ben­e­fit 200,000 grad­u­ates, in­clud­ing work­ers in Sabah and Johor who lost their jobs ow­ing to bor­der clo­sures be­tween Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>With on­line sales boom­ing, grants worth RM150 mil­lion will be dished out to help busi­nesses go on­line.</p>
    <p>“The virus out­break made me re­alise how im­por­tant it is for busi­nesses to have a strong on­line pres­ence. I was al­most forced to shut mine down be­cause I re­lied heav­ily on sales via my phys­i­cal shop,” beauty prod­uct seller Na­dia Rusli, 36, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>With Malaysia hav­ing more than 400,000 house­holds whose earn­ings are be­low the poverty line, the bud­get aims to raise aid given to low-in­come fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>House­holds with a monthly in­come of less than RM2,500 will re­ceive a one-time pay­ment of be­tween RM1,200 and RM1,800. House­holds with a monthly in­come of RM2,501 to RM4,000 will re­ceive RM800 to RM1,200.</p>
    <p>While many wel­come th­ese pro­pos­als, oth­ers say the gov­ern­ment could do bet­ter, by set­ting up food banks, for ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>“I love the up­skilling and reskilling ini­tia­tive they an­nounced. It would greatly help peo­ple like me to se­cure a job,” said car­pet cleaner Michael Nadara­jah. “But I feel we also need more food banks so that when push comes to shove, we have some­where to get im­me­di­ate help from.”</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Union of the Teach­ing Pro­fes­sion (NUTP) on Thurs­day urged the gov­ern­ment to pro­vide lap­tops to more stu­dents from low-in­come fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>Un­der a bud­get pro­posal, gov­ern­ment-linked com­pa­nies would give RM150 mil­lion to pro­vide lap­tops to 150,000 stu­dents in 500 schools as a pi­lot project.</p>
    <p>“There are about five mil­lion stu­dents na­tion­wide... if only 150,000 of them from 500 schools re­ceive the lap­tops, the num­bers are rel­a­tively small,” said NUTP’s sec­re­tary-gen­eral Harry Tan Huat Hock.</p>
    <p>A United Na­tions study con­ducted from May to Septem­ber re­vealed that 7 per cent of up­per sec­ondary-age stu­dents in Malaysia have not re­turned to school although the gov­ern­ment re­opened ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions in May.</p>
    <p>Some Malaysians are wor­ried about where their next meal will come from. Grab de­liv­ery man Nas­rul Ibrahim Musa said that while he is happy with the cash aid he is en­ti­tled to, he is more con­cerned about se­cur­ing a sta­ble job.</p>
    <p>Like many oth­ers, the 26-yearold me­chan­i­cal en­gi­neer­ing grad­u­ate was laid off this year.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s un­em­ploy­ment rate was 4.6 per cent in Septem­ber, af­ter hav­ing hit a record high of 5.3 per cent in May.</p>
    <p>“Yes, get­ting cash is nice but I’d rather have a sta­ble job. I’ve gone to count­less in­ter­views but po­ten­tial em­ploy­ers are only of­fer­ing part­time gigs,” Mr Nas­rul told The Straits Times. “At the same time, there are al­ready too many de­liv­ery men. Where do peo­ple like me go?”</p>
