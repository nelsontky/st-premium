    <p>Af­ter more than three weeks on the ventilator, af­ter bat­tling weak­ness and delir­ium on the gen­eral med­i­cal floor and a stay at the long-term re­hab hos­pi­tal where she re­built the strength to walk again, my pa­tient had made it home. The dark shad­ows be­neath her eyes were fad­ing. Her skin was tanned. The per­sis­tent short­ness of breath had fi­nally abated, and she had re­cently run four miles to com­mem­o­rate four months since she was di­ag­nosed with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Four months. I closed my eyes and found my­self once again in those early days of the pan­demic, clus­tered out­side her room with a team of doc­tors and nurses. Nearly two weeks in, she still needed high lev­els of sup­port from the ventilator and we were start­ing to talk about the im­pos­si­ble de­ci­sions we might face if her lungs never im­proved. But we waited, be­cause this was a new virus and we did not know its course, and be­cause we had the re­sources to do so. And now there she was, in clinic – months later, do­ing far bet­ter than I would have pre­dicted.</p>
    <p>I have been sur­prised by sim­i­lar re­cov­er­ies in the past weeks.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple we thought could die, or at least end up sig­nif­i­cantly im­paired, have made it home. But there is some­thing trou­bling about this too. It is clear to me that there was no one spe­cific ther­apy that de­ter­mined the out­comes of our sick­est coron­avirus pa­tients in the in­ten­sive care unit (ICU).</p>
    <p>On the con­trary. While even the best pos­si­ble treat­ment couldn’t save ev­ery­one, those who sur­vived did so be­cause of metic­u­lous crit­i­cal care, which re­quires a com­bi­na­tion of re­sources and com­pe­tency that is avail­able only to a mi­nor­ity of hos­pi­tals in this coun­try. And now, even as we race to­wards the hope of a magic bul­let for this virus, we must openly ac­knowl­edge that dis­par­ity – and work to ad­dress it.</p>
    <p>Since the be­gin­ning of this cri­sis, con­ver­sa­tions about death from Covid-19 have re­volved around pa­tient char­ac­ter­is­tics – men are more likely to die than women, as are peo­ple who are older or obese, or those with co-mor­bidi­ties. But we now know that the hos­pi­tal mat­ters too.</p>
    <p>In a large study re­cently pub­lished in the jour­nal Jama In­ter­nal Medicine, a team of re­searchers ex­am­ined hos­pi­tal mor­tal­ity rates in over 2,200 crit­i­cally ill coron­avirus pa­tients in 65 hos­pi­tals through­out the coun­try. Their find­ings? Pa­tients ad­mit­ted to hos­pi­tals with fewer than 50 ICU beds – smaller hos­pi­tals – were more than three times more likely to die than those ad­mit­ted to larger hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>Though they were not able to study fac­tors like staffing and hos­pi­tal strain, these likely con­trib­uted. In fact, a re­cent in­ves­tiga­tive piece in The Times ex­am­ined mor­tal­ity data for hos­pi­tals in New York City – and found that at the peak of the pan­demic, pa­tients at some com­mu­nity hos­pi­tals (with lower staffing and worse equip­ment) were three times more likely to die than pa­tients in med­i­cal cen­tres in the wealth­i­est ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Know­ing first-hand what it re­quires to keep crit­i­cally ill Covid-19 pa­tients alive, this does not sur­prise me. Though the pub­lic has largely fo­cused on new treatments – with ex­cite­ment and con­tro­versy swirling around remde­sivir and dex­am­etha­sone and con­va­les­cent plasma – none of these is any use with­out the peo­ple and sys­tems to de­liver crit­i­cal care, a la­bo­ri­ous and re­source-in­ten­sive process.</p>
    <p>In the ICU, we must in­ter­pret and re­act to each in­di­ca­tor. Our nurses are fre­quently at the bed­side, at­tuned to the most minute change. We make con­stant small tweaks to the ventilator and to our med­i­ca­tions to sup­port blood pres­sure. Though it looks pas­sive in a way – a co­matose pa­tient in a bed – and is not at all glam­orous, crit­i­cal care is an im­mensely ac­tive process.</p>
    <p>We are all fa­mil­iar with the im­ages of Covid-19 pa­tients ly­ing on their chests, and we know that prone po­si­tion­ing saves lives. But the sim­ple act of turn­ing a crit­i­cally ill pa­tient is phys­i­cally stren­u­ous and, if done hastily, treach­er­ous. Breath­ing tubes and in­tra­venous lines can be­come dis­lodged. The head must be repo­si­tioned ev­ery two hours. At my hos­pi­tal, dur­ing the height of the pan­demic, we formed a dedicated “prone team” of res­pi­ra­tory and phys­i­cal ther­a­pists who were avail­able 24 hours a day. This spared the bed­side nurses and kept pa­tients as safe as pos­si­ble. Even so, breath­ing tubes be­came kinked, and on at least one oc­ca­sion, we had to ur­gently re­place a breath­ing tube – a risky pro­ce­dure.</p>
    <p>This is why in some hos­pi­tals, prone po­si­tion­ing might not have been of­fered at all. In­deed, the Jama study found rates of prone po­si­tion­ing to range from just un­der 5 per cent at one hos­pi­tal to nearly 80 per cent at an­other. Pa­tients would have suf­fered as a re­sult.</p>
    <p>Any­one who has cared for a coron­avirus pa­tient knows how quickly they can crash. Thick mu­cus blocks air­ways and en­do­tra­cheal tubes. Oxy­gen lev­els plum­met. Heart rhythms go hay­wire. As a doc­tor, I’ll ad­mit that we are rarely the first to in­ter­vene in these mo­ments of cri­sis. In­stead, we rely on nurses and res­pi­ra­tory ther­a­pists. More times than I would like to count, I have watched with grat­i­tude as their in­ter­ven­tions – suc­tion­ing, repo­si­tion­ing a breath­ing tube, in­creas­ing the dose of med­i­ca­tions to raise blood pres­sure – avert cer­tain dis­as­ter. It is hum­bling to re­alise that had our nurses been spread too thin, these rel­a­tively small events would have turned cat­a­strophic.</p>
    <p>Per­haps most im­por­tantly, be­cause we had the re­sources to do so, we were able to give our pa­tients time for their lungs to re­cover. I think of one man so sick that he was de­pen­dent not just on the ventilator but also on a heart-lung by­pass ma­chine. These ma­chines, and the staff who know how to man­age them, are a truly lim­ited re­source. Large aca­demic cen­tres have five of them, maybe 10. Some com­mu­nity hos­pi­tals do not have any.</p>
    <p>This man had been on the ma­chine for weeks, en­coun­ter­ing one com­pli­ca­tion af­ter an­other. He bled, we stopped blood thin­ners, and then sur­geons had to rush in overnight to re­place a part of the ma­chine when it clot­ted off. There seemed to be no way out. But then, even as we pre­pared to say enough, his lungs started to im­prove. I re­mem­ber stand­ing out­side his room one overnight, amazed, as his stiff lungs be­gan to work with the ventilator once again.</p>
    <p>He has now left the hos­pi­tal. On the night of his re­turn home, his son sent me a note: “Fi­nally fam­ily is back, and that is the best feel­ing of this world.” You might say he was lucky. But so were we. He was able to re­turn home not be­cause of any 11th-hour save on our part, but be­cause we were able to watch and wait. And we could af­ford to do so only be­cause here in Bos­ton, we were busy but never un­der­wa­ter.</p>
    <p>Of course, we made mis­takes, mis­cal­cu­la­tions and er­rors in judg­ment as we learnt about this new dis­ease. But we were in a priv­i­leged po­si­tion. It could have been far worse. And as the pan­demic tears through ru­ral ar­eas of the coun­try with even less ac­cess to re­source-rich hos­pi­tals, I am wor­ried that the in­equities of this virus will only be­come more en­trenched.</p>
    <p>Just as we de­vote re­sources to find­ing a vac­cine, we must also de­vote re­sources to help­ing hos­pi­tals de­liver high-qual­ity crit­i­cal care. Maybe that will mean bet­ter al­lo­cat­ing the re­sources we do have through a more ro­bust, co­or­di­nated sys­tem of hos­pi­tal-to-hos­pi­tal pa­tient trans­fers within each re­gion.</p>
    <p>Maybe it means cre­at­ing some­thing akin to dedicated coron­avirus cen­tres of ex­cel­lence through­out the coun­try, with cer­tain core com­pe­ten­cies.</p>
    <p>Maybe it will mean ex­pand­ing the reach of ex­pe­ri­enced crit­i­cal care hos­pi­tals through tele­health. This will not be easy. But as this virus will be with us for the fore­see­able fu­ture, it is our duty to try.</p>
    <p>As the video visit with my pa­tient ended that day, she re­minded me that she had been trans­ferred to us from a small hos­pi­tal in the western part of our state. “If I hadn’t been trans­ferred, I would have died,” she said.</p>
    <p>I paused, re­flect­ing on that. What had we done for her, re­ally? We had never en­rolled her in a clin­i­cal trial. There was no mys­tery di­ag­no­sis to be solved, no high-risk pro­ce­dure per­formed. We sim­ply did our best to min­imise dam­age to her lungs and keep her other or­gans func­tion­ing while we waited – which makes it even more painful to ad­mit that she might be right.</p>
