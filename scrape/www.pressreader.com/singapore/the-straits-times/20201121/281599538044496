    <p>From 11.59pm to­mor­row, all trav­ellers en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore who have been in Malaysia in the pre­vi­ous 14 days must serve a 14-day stay-home no­tice (SHN) at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>This also ap­plies to those en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore to work un­der the Pe­ri­odic Com­mut­ing Ar­range­ment and re­turn­ing Sin­ga­pore-based trav­ellers un­der the Sin­ga­pore-Malaysia Re­cip­ro­cal Green Lane.</p>
    <p>The same rule will ap­ply to trav­ellers en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore who have trav­elled to Ja­pan in the pre­vi­ous 14 days.</p>
    <p>It ap­plies even if the trav­ellers had ear­lier ob­tained ap­proval to be at their place of res­i­dence dur­ing their SHN pe­riod rather than at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The rule also ap­plies to re­turn­ing Sin­ga­pore-based trav­ellers un­der the Sin­ga­pore-Ja­pan Re­cip­ro­cal Green Lane.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, trav­ellers from Ja­pan were al­lowed to opt out of stay­ing at a ded­i­cated SHN fa­cil­ity and be at their res­i­dence if they had a suit­able one.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers from Malaysia, ex­clud­ing Sabah, were also pre­vi­ously al­lowed to re­main at their res­i­dence for a seven-day SHN, while those who trav­elled to Sabah had to be at ded­i­cated SHN fa­cil­i­ties for 14 days.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) said yes­ter­day that the tight­en­ing of bor­der mea­sures was due to the resur­gence of cases in Malaysia and Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>Also, trav­ellers who are not Sin­ga­pore­ans or per­ma­nent res­i­dents and who re­cently trav­elled to Malaysia within the 14 days prior to en­try must take a Covid-19 poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test within 72 hours be­fore de­par­ture to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>They have to present a valid neg­a­tive Covid-19 test re­sult to en­ter Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>This re­quire­ment will take ef­fect for those ar­riv­ing in Sin­ga­pore from 11.59pm next Fri­day, though it will not ap­ply to re­turn­ing Sin­ga­pore-based trav­ellers un­der the Sin­ga­pore-Malaysia Re­cip­ro­cal Green Lane.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, there were four new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed as at noon yes­ter­day, all of whom were im­ported, said MOH.</p>
    <p>There were no new lo­cal cases for the 10th day in a row.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s cases take Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,143.</p>
