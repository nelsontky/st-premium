    <p>The National Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) is tak­ing more steps to tackle sex­ual mis­con­duct, in the wake of re­cent cases which in­volved its fac­ulty mem­bers and fol­low­ing a re­view. Many of these mea­sures will be im­ple­mented over the next few months. They in­clude train­ing for staff and by­standers, and pub­lish­ing a six-monthly re­port on cases.</p>
    <p>The National Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) is tak­ing more steps to tackle sex­ual mis­con­duct, in the wake of sev­eral re­cent cases which in­volved its fac­ulty mem­bers and fol­low­ing a re­cent re­view.</p>
    <p>In an e-mail cir­cu­lar to stu­dents, staff and alumni yes­ter­day, NUS pres­i­dent Tan Eng Chye laid out the mea­sures the univer­sity will im­ple­ment to strengthen its pro­cesses of han­dling cases of sex­ual mis­con­duct, which will in­clude the train­ing of staff and by­standers.</p>
    <p>Many of these mea­sures will be im­ple­mented over the next few months.</p>
    <p>The univer­sity plans to de­velop a sex­ual mis­con­duct pol­icy that ap­plies to both staff and stu­dents. It will also pro­vide the NUS com­mu­nity with a re­port ev­ery six months on sex­ual mis­con­duct cases in­volv­ing its staff and/or stu­dents. But the facts of each case will be redacted to pre­vent vic­tims from be­ing iden­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>It will soon in­tro­duce re­fresher cour­ses for staff and stu­dents to re­in­force re­spect and con­sent, and it is ex­plor­ing by­stander train­ing to em­pha­sise the im­por­tance of this role in spot­ting sex­ual mis­con­duct and tak­ing ap­pro­pri­ate ac­tion.</p>
    <p>There are also plans to con­duct work­shops to “build an in­clu­sive and re­spect­ful cul­ture on cam­pus, and to strengthen train­ing for staff who are likely to be first re­spon­ders in cases where sex­ual mis­con­duct has oc­curred”, said Pro­fes­sor Tan.</p>
    <p>He added that the Vic­tim Care Unit, which cur­rently sup­ports vic­tims who are stu­dents, will be re­named the NUS Care Unit. By the sec­ond quar­ter of next year, this unit will be pro­vided re­sources to ex­tend sup­port to NUS staff.</p>
    <p>Prof Tan also said the univer­sity has tight­ened its in­ter­nal pro­cesses to en­sure that it will com­plete any re­port­ing of ar­restable of­fences to the po­lice no later than two weeks af­ter its board of dis­ci­pline, for stu­dents, or the com­mit­tee of in­quiry, for staff, has con­cluded its in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>A po­lice re­port may be filed if the cir­cum­stances war­rant it, he said, adding that un­der Sec­tion 424 of the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code, NUS is re­quired by law to re­port any ar­restable of­fence listed. This in­cludes voyeurism, out­rage of mod­esty and rape.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the univer­sity has set up a com­mit­tee to look at sex­ual mis­con­duct by staff, and will share more de­tails on how it will im­ple­ment its rec­om­men­da­tions later.</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edg­ing that be­ing open and more trans­par­ent about sex­ual mis­con­duct of­fences is crit­i­cal to build­ing trust and a cul­ture of re­spect on cam­pus, Prof Tan said NUS will con­tinue shar­ing per­ti­nent in­for­ma­tion about al­le­ga­tions and in­ves­ti­ga­tion find­ings with the univer­sity com­mu­nity in a proac­tive and timely man­ner. This will be done, where fea­si­ble, with­out com­pro­mis­ing the pri­vacy and well-be­ing of vic­tims, he said.</p>
    <p>The lat­est mea­sures come af­ter sev­eral cases of sex­ual mis­con­duct in­volv­ing NUS staff that made the news this year.</p>
    <p>These in­clude Pro­fes­sor Theodore G. Hopf, the for­mer provost chair pro­fes­sor of the de­part­ment of po­lit­i­cal sci­ence in the Fac­ulty of Arts and So­cial Sciences, who was dis­missed on Dec 1 for sex­ual mis­con­duct with a stu­dent.</p>
    <p>NUS also re­ported last month that Pro­fes­sor Zheng Yong­nian, a for­mer di­rec­tor of its East Asian In­sti­tute, had be­haved in­ap­pro­pri­ately with a sub­or­di­nate by hug­ging her with­out her con­sent dur­ing a work meet­ing.</p>
    <p>Dr Jeremy Fer­nando, a for­mer Tem­busu Col­lege fel­low, was sacked on Oct 7 fol­low­ing al­le­ga­tions of sex­ual mis­con­duct made against him by two stu­dents.</p>
    <p>In yes­ter­day’s e-mail, Prof Tan said: “Re­gard­less of whether these in­ci­dents took place on or off cam­pus, such be­hav­iour threat­ens the safety and well-be­ing of our NUS com­mu­nity. It des­e­crates the cam­pus at­mos­phere, which is pre­cious to all of us.</p>
    <p>“The sad truth is that no mat­ter how hard we try, sex­ual mis­con­duct can­not be com­pletely erad­i­cated. Yet, we must be un­re­lent­ing in our de­sire and ef­fort to tackle the is­sue head-on. Our ap­proach has to be holis­tic, just, trans­par­ent and sen­si­tive.”</p>
    <p>He noted that sex­ual mis­con­duct is a grow­ing con­cern for uni­ver­si­ties around the world. Last year, Har­vard Univer­sity re­ceived 500 com­plaints, Yale Univer­sity re­ceived 298 com­plaints and Stan­ford Univer­sity had 187 re­ported in­ci­dents of sex­ual mis­con­duct.</p>
    <p>In the same year in Sin­ga­pore, a to­tal of 1,605 cases of out­rage of mod­esty were re­ported to the po­lice.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion re­ported that in the three aca­demic years of 2015, 2016 and 2017, the six lo­cal uni­ver­si­ties han­dled a to­tal of 56 stu­dent-re­lated dis­ci­plinary cases in­volv­ing sex­ual mis­con­duct, 14 of which took place out­side cam­puses.</p>
    <p>Prof Tan also said that NUS is see­ing more in­di­vid­u­als com­ing for­ward to file re­ports against al­leged per­pe­tra­tors of sex­ual mis­con­duct.</p>
    <p>“Even though it may not au­gur well for the im­age and rep­u­ta­tion of the univer­sity, I feel it is a good thing that more in­di­vid­u­als are step­ping for­ward. It shows a cer­tain level of trust in the in­sti­tu­tion,” he added.</p>
    <p>“No stu­dent or staff should suf­fer in si­lence. NUS will con­tinue to strive to pro­vide a safe and con­ducive plat­form for af­fected par­ties to ver­balise and share their ex­pe­ri­ences and come for­ward in con­fi­dence.”</p>
