    <p>Con­tin­u­ing the de­bate on for­eign man­power pol­icy, MPs stressed the need to tighten the rules – from im­pos­ing quo­tas and a min­i­mum wage, to a fixed time­line for skills trans­fer from for­eign­ers to lo­cals.</p>
    <p>The sug­ges­tions are not new, but the tone has taken on greater ur­gency against the back­drop of the coun­try’s worst re­ces­sion since in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo and Dr Koh Poh Koon (Tampines GRC) yes­ter­day broke down the pluses and pit­falls.</p>
    <p>On a min­i­mum wage, Mrs Teo ex­plained that the Pro­gres­sive Wage Model (PWM) – cur­rently man­dated in the clean­ing, se­cu­rity and land­scape sec­tors – is in fact a lad­der built on top of a min­i­mum wage, with wages go­ing up as skills and pro­duc­tiv­ity im­prove.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment, she said, prefers to ex­pand PWM over time to more sec­tors, tak­ing care to as­sess the ca­pac­ity of busi­nesses in those sec­tors to ab­sorb the change, es­pe­cially that of small and medium-sized en­ter­prises.</p>
    <p>The ap­proach must also be a holis­tic one, by rais­ing stan­dards of liv­ing for lower-in­come work­ers in other mean­ing­ful ways – such as achiev­ing home own­er­ship, and pro­vid­ing ac­cess to qual­ity health­care and ed­u­ca­tion for their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Dr Koh, who is deputy sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the Na­tional Trades Union Congress as well as Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Health, warned that a cri­sis is not the best time to raise wages, es­pe­cially when busi­nesses are fac­ing a cash­flow crunch.</p>
    <p>“Tim­ing is im­por­tant,” he said. “We must make sure a bal­ance is struck, so that ‘low wage’ doesn’t be­come ‘no wage’.”</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, im­pos­ing quo­tas at the higher end of Em­ploy­ment Passes (EP) is not un­think­able, but un­wise, said Mrs Teo.</p>
    <p>Eco­nomic agen­cies such as the Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board and Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) need flex­i­bil­ity to com­pete for cut­ting-edge in­vest­ments and so­phis­ti­cated ac­tiv­i­ties to be moved to Sin­ga­pore, she said.</p>
    <p>She added that us­ing salary re­quire­ments to get for­eign pro­fes­sion­als of the right qual­ity, mar­ried with firm-level com­mit­ments to build up lo­cal ca­pa­bil­i­ties over time, will be a bet­ter ap­proach.</p>
    <p>Zoom­ing in on the fi­nan­cial sec­tor, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung, who is also an MAS board mem­ber, said it is not a “zero-sum game” and num­bers alone do not mean that Sin­ga­pore­ans are get­ting the short end of the stick.</p>
    <p>Last year, Sin­ga­pore­ans ac­counted for about 70 per cent of se­nior man­age­ment roles in re­tail banks’ lo­cal func­tions. In non-re­tail banks, where there is a higher con­cen­tra­tion of re­gional and global func­tions, the pro­por­tion is lower, at about 40 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said that first, the ab­so­lute num­ber of Sin­ga­pore­ans in these roles has in­creased.</p>
    <p>Se­cond, when these func­tions come here, Sin­ga­pore­ans gain valu­able global and re­gional ex­per­tise.</p>
    <p>But for some MPs, their quar­rel was not with the ra­tio­nale be­hind such poli­cies. Rather, they be­lieve that moral sua­sion can only go so far.</p>
    <p>Left to mar­ket forces, cor­po­rate be­hav­iour does not al­ways pro­duce the de­sired out­come, they said.</p>
    <p>Take in­her­ent hir­ing bias. It is no sur­prise that for­eign en­ti­ties would fo­cus on their own or­gan­i­sa­tions’ pri­or­i­ties, such as prof­itabil­ity or their own na­tional in­ter­ests, said Ms Joan Pereira (Tan­jong Pa­gar GRC).</p>
    <p>Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Pan­jang) ar­gued that the tail should not wag the dog.</p>
    <p>Global in­sti­tu­tions choose to set up in Sin­ga­pore not just be­cause of its for­eign man­power pol­icy, but also its other com­pelling at­tributes, such as the depth and liq­uid­ity of its cap­i­tal mar­kets, sound reg­u­la­tions and po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity, he said.</p>
    <p>“We must there­fore be self-as­sured that from time to time we would nec­es­sar­ily need some re-cal­i­bra­tion to our man­power flows in re­sponse to the cy­cles in the labour mar­kets.”</p>
    <p>Cit­ing job mis­matches and fric­tion in job tran­si­tions, he added that train­ing al­lowances and sub­sidised trainee­ships are needed to in­cen­tivise com­pa­nies to hire more lo­cals.</p>
    <p>Non-Con­stituency MP Leong Mun Wai, from the Progress Sin­ga­pore Party, pro­posed a cap on for­eign­ers for cer­tain com­pa­nies, as well as rules to en­sure that each for­eign man­ager is re­placed by a lo­cal at the end of his visa pe­riod.</p>
    <p>But the de­bate took a sharp left turn, when he pressed for data on the num­ber of per­ma­nent res­i­dents (PRs) and new cit­i­zen­ships granted be­tween 2014 and last year, ver­sus the growth in the num­ber of lo­cal pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs).</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo re­sponded that each year, the num­ber of cit­i­zens goes up by around 20,000 and new PRs, by around 30,000.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, I think what Mr</p>
    <p>Leong is try­ing to sug­gest is that all the (PMET) gains are mean­ing­less be­cause they are all oc­cu­pied by (new) PRs and cit­i­zens. But he’s wrong in imag­in­ing that all of them are in the work­force,” she said, point­ing out that a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber are school-go­ing chil­dren or the spouses of Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ja­mus Lim (Sengkang GRC) of the Work­ers’ Party then asked if sim­ply slow­ing down the rate of EP and S Pass growth is suf­fi­cient to en­sure that lo­cal PMETs do not get dis­placed, given that many PMET po­si­tions here may have al­ready been se­cured by for­eign tal­ent.</p>
    <p>As ques­tions from the op­po­si­tion piled up, Ms Jes­sica Tan (East Coast GRC) took to the podium to ask Prof Lim point­edly if he had an al­ter­na­tive pro­posal to of­fer, with Prof Lim coun­ter­ing that he was mak­ing a clar­i­fi­ca­tion and not a pro­posal.</p>
    <p>By the time the first half of the ses­sion ended, it was not clear that the ex­change had achieved any more clar­ity on the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>It is worth not­ing Leader of the Op­po­si­tion Pri­tam Singh’s ear­lier sug­ges­tion to have more Se­lect Com­mit­tees as a safety valve, so that pos­i­tive con­ver­sa­tions – closed-door or oth­er­wise – can be had on sen­si­tive is­sues.</p>
    <p>And what a sen­si­tive is­sue this is. Choke off for­eign man­power, and one risks throt­tling busi­nesses and spook­ing in­vestors.</p>
    <p>Leave the mar­ket to work things out, and more firms could game the sys­tem, lead­ing to Sin­ga­pore­ans be­ing passed over for good jobs.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mrs Teo re­minded the House that many new cit­i­zens and PRs have fam­ily ties with Sin­ga­pore­ans, and it is vir­tu­ally im­pos­si­ble to draw a clear line in the sand.</p>
    <p>Urg­ing them to look at the big­ger pic­ture, she left them with this thought: “It is well and good to say it’s all about in­for­ma­tion trans­parency, but dig a bit deeper and ask our­selves, what sort of val­ues are we try­ing to re­flect in ask­ing these ques­tions?”</p>
    <p>Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPher­son), too, made an im­por­tant point: Ul­ti­mately, Sin­ga­pore­ans must be able to as­sume lead­er­ship po­si­tions in or­gan­i­sa­tions based on their own ca­pa­bil­i­ties, and not purely through af­fir­ma­tive ac­tion in the labour mar­ket.</p>
    <p>There can be no pride in be­ing a big fish in an ever-shrink­ing pond. And if that should hap­pen, Sin­ga­pore would have won the short-term bat­tle, but given up the longer-term fight.</p>
