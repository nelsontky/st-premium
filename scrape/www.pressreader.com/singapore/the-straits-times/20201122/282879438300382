    <p>Put in small amounts of money reg­u­larly, di­ver­sify your as­sets and in­vest for the long haul.</p>
    <p>Th­ese are some things young in­vestors should do when they start to grow their wealth, say ex­perts.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank wealth ad­vi­sory head Kelvin Goh said that when in­vestors put in money reg­u­larly when mar­kets are go­ing up, their re­turns will not be as good as when they com­mit a lump sum, but at least they are still par­tic­i­pat­ing in the up­side.</p>
    <p>He warned that mar­kets are volatile, so in­vestors might panic if they are hold­ing on to a lump sum and see the in­vest­ment fall by 10 per cent to 30 per cent, for ex­am­ple. “When mar­kets re­cover, you could have al­ready sold off your po­si­tion.”</p>
    <p>In con­trast, in­vestors who have a reg­u­lar plan will not need to make many tac­ti­cal changes to their port­fo­lios on a daily ba­sis, he added.</p>
    <p>It is also im­por­tant for young in­vestors to start grow­ing their wealth early.</p>
    <p>Ms Evy Wee, DBS Bank’s head of fi­nan­cial plan­ning and per­sonal in­vest­ing, said with a longer in­vest­ment hori­zon, Gen Z youth and mil</p>
    <p>lenni­als have a bet­ter chance of mak­ing the most of their in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Dhruv Arora, founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of dig­i­tal wealth</p>
    <p>man­age­ment plat­form Syfe, said in­vest­ing is about “time in the mar­ket, rather than tim­ing the mar­ket”.</p>
    <p>“Don’t con­fuse in­vest­ing with trad­ing. Trad­ing is some­thing that gets ac­quired over time, and early on, you have to be pre­pared to lose. But if you stay in­vested, you’ll be in it for the long term.”</p>
    <p>He added that in­vestors should keep their costs low and di­ver­sify their port­fo­lios in­stead of putting all their eggs in one bas­ket.</p>
    <p>“Be con­stantly learn­ing. The world is chang­ing, and the op­tions to in­vest and how you han­dle your money are evolv­ing.”</p>
