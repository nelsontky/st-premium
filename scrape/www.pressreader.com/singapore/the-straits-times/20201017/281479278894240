    <p>Be­ing an eco-friendly shop­per in Sin­ga­pore means opt­ing for and us­ing a re­us­able plas­tic bag many times in­stead of us­ing a cot­ton one, a new study has found.</p>
    <p>For­got the re­us­able plas­tic bag? Then the next best op­tion would be to use a sin­gle-use plas­tic bag, in­stead of a pa­per one or one made of biodegrad­able poly­mers.</p>
    <p>Th­ese find­ings by re­searchers from Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Uni­ver­sity (NTU) and their col­leagues in Fin­land were pub­lished in Au­gust in the Jour­nal Of Cleaner Pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>In the pa­per, the re­searchers noted that while plas­tic gro­cery bags are one of the most com­mon sin­gle-use pack­ag­ing prod­ucts, other op­tions have been gain­ing trac­tion. Th­ese in­clude sin­gle-use bags made of pa­per or biodegrad­able plas­tic, or re­us­able bags made of cot­ton or polypropy­lene non-wo­ven plas­tic.</p>
    <p>But how do they stack up against one another in terms of how en­vi­ron­men­tally friendly they are here?</p>
    <p>The lat­est study pro­vides the an­swer, with the re­searchers modelling the en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact of each type of bag based on a host of fac­tors, such as how the bags are made, trans­ported, dis­trib­uted, col­lected as waste, treated and dis­posed of.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the study took into ac­count the quan­ti­ties of nat­u­ral re­sources used to make each type of bag, and their transocean­ic ship­ment from where they were pro­duced to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers found that if a re­us­able plas­tic bag made of</p>
    <p>polypropy­lene non-wo­ven plas­tic is used at least 50 times, it is the most eco-friendly op­tion here. This refers to the type of re­us­able bag com­monly sold at su­per­mar­ket check­out coun­ters for about $1.</p>
    <p>A sin­gle-use plas­tic bag, such as those usu­ally given out for free, comes in as the sec­ond-most en­vi­ron­men­tally friendly op­tion. But it still has 14 times the global warm­ing po­ten­tial of a re­us­able plas­tic bag used at least 50 times.</p>
    <p>Global warm­ing po­ten­tial mea­sures the en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact of var­i­ous green­house gases, which are pro­duced in the man­u­fac­ture, use and dis­posal of the bags. It pro­vides a com­mon unit of mea­sure.</p>
    <p>Sin­gle-use biodegrad­able plas­tic bags are the third-most ecofriendl­y op­tion in Sin­ga­pore, which in­cin­er­ates most of its non-re­cy­clable waste any­way. This op­tion has 16 times the global warm­ing po­ten­tial com­pared with a re­us­able plas­tic bag.</p>
    <p>Re­us­able cot­ton wo­ven bags come in fourth with 17 times the global warm­ing po­ten­tial, while sin­gle-use pa­per bags are the most en­vi­ron­men­tally damaging, with 81 times the global warm­ing po­ten­tial.</p>
    <p>The pro­duc­tion of cot­ton i nvolves pes­ti­cide use, and long-term heavy met­als dis­charge into wa­ter. Pa­per bag pro­duc­tion in­volves gen­er­a­tion of liq­uid waste, noted the au­thors.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Grze­gorz Lisak, di­rec­tor of the Residues and Re­source Recla­ma­tion Cen­tre at NTU’s Nanyang En­vi­ron­ment and Wa­ter Re­search In­sti­tute, who led the re­search, said: “Our main mes­sage is that re­us­able plas­tic bags are the best op­tion, pro­vided that they are reused many times – over 50 times to be pre­cise.”</p>
    <p>Con­text is im­por­tant, he added. This is be­cause bags have to be trans­ported across dif­fer­ent dis­tances, depend­ing on where they come from and where the city that im­ports them is. Each coun­try may also deal with waste dif­fer­ently.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, which has a closed waste man­age­ment sys­tem with in­cin­er­a­tion treat­ment, us­ing plas­tic bags – both re­us­able and sin­gle-use types – may be the best op­tion that is cur­rently avail­able, he said.</p>
    <p>“This is pro­vided that there is no sig­nif­i­cant leak­age of waste into the en­vi­ron­ment,” Prof Lisak added.</p>
    <p>Plas­tic bags, if not dis­posed of</p>
    <p>prop­erly, can con­tam­i­nate the nat­u­ral en­vi­ron­ment and end up in the ocean, where they can en­snare wildlife or be eaten by an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Youth for Cli­mate Ac­tion mem­ber Alice Soe­wito said the find­ings had to be com­mu­ni­cated care­fully, so peo­ple do not mis­in­ter­pret them as show­ing that plas­tic bags are eco-friendly.</p>
    <p>“Such a mes­sage could be mis­lead­ing, and it could dis­tract from our end goal of min­imis­ing or elim­i­nat­ing the use of th­ese sin­gle-use dis­pos­ables,” said Ms Soe­wito, an en­vi­ron­ment and sus­tain­abil­ity ma­jor at Cor­nell Uni­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>To nudge con­sumer be­hav­iour, she sug­gested that re­us­able plas­tic bags be given to each house­hold in a one-off dis­tri­bu­tion. A sur­charge should also be im­posed on each sin­gle-use plas­tic bag taken by a cus­tomer.</p>
    <p>“The bat­tle should never be about swop­ping between dif­fer­ent ma­te­ri­als – like pa­per and plas­tic bags for sin­gle-use items. The ques­tion we should ask our­selves is why are we still us­ing sin­gle-use items,” she said.</p>
