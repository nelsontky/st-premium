    <p>When I fire up this Du­cati in a cov­ered carpark, I feel like I am in a Mo­toGP pad­dock.</p>
    <p>With­out a flashy fair­ing, the 2020 Street­fighter V4 S may not look like a race bike. But it sure sounds like one.</p>
    <p>While the Ital­ian-made Street­fighter is clas­si­fied as a naked bike, it is in essence a su­per­bike. It has 208bhp and 123Nm of torque – figures within the do­main of mod­ern su­per­bikes.</p>
    <p>With a dry weight of 178kg, the 1,103cc Street­fighter sprints from zero to 100kmh in un­der 3.5 sec­onds and to a top speed of close to 300kmh.</p>
    <p>Lit­tle winglets at the sides of its huge ra­di­a­tor will not cause you to lift off. They ac­tu­ally add more down­force and en­hance straight­line sta­bil­ity at higher speeds. Du­cati says the bi-plane-styled winglets put 28kg of down­force in front and 8kg at the rear at a li­cence-burning speed of 270kmh.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion is, can you live with such per­for­mance on Sin­ga­pore’s roads? The an­swer is sur­pris­ingly yes.</p>
    <p>You could ar­gue the Street­fighter is merely a stripped-down Pani­gale V4. It is still a looker with its min­i­mal­ist head­lamp, ex­posed en­gine cylin­ders, pin­cer-like brake lights and March­esini nine-spoke rims.</p>
    <p>But you can­not ride the Pani­gale on longer jaunts.</p>
    <p>The Street­fighter, on the other hand, is more com­fort­able as it comes with a tall, wide han­dle­bar – un­like its su­per­bike sib­ling’s clip-on han­dle­bars. Its dirt­bike-style han­dle­bar, which has a mild for­ward stretch, re­duces wrist pres­sure com­monly as­so­ci­ated with race bikes.</p>
    <p>Pre­mium Oh­lins sus­pen­sion and steer­ing damper con­trib­ute to a longer sad­dle time. Elec­tron­i­cally con­trolled, they are near-per­fect at re­spond­ing to the 23 road im­per­fec­tions on my reg­u­lar 22.5km route from the of­fice to home.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the most im­por­tant con­sid­er­a­tion for me is the Street­fighter’s elec­tron­ics. Du­cati boasts cor­ner­ing anti-lock brakes as well as trac­tion, slide, launch and wheelie con­trols – all de­rived from Mo­toGP rac­ing.</p>
    <p>In Race and Sport modes, the Street­fighter re­acts ag­gres­sively to throt­tle in­puts. Dur­ing full-throt­tle take-offs, it feels like my arms are be­ing pulled apart.</p>
    <p>In Street mode, the throt­tle re­sponse is more pro­gres­sive and for­giv­ing and its sus­pen­sion takes into ac­count bumpy road con­di­tions. All three ride modes de­liver 208bhp with lev­els of elec­tronic in­ter­ven­tion which can be per­son­alised.</p>
    <p>This does not mean the Street­fighter is im­po­tent in Street mode. Its 5-inch TFT dash­board will still show the rev nee­dle rac­ing to­wards its 15,000rpm ceil­ing. Its clutch­less up/down quick­shifter re­wards you with seam­less ac­cel­er­a­tion even when the throt­tle is pinned.</p>
    <p>While al­ways ready for spir­ited runs, the Street­fighter is equally happy to cruise at 90kmh in sixth gear with 4,200rpm show­ing on its tachome­ter.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing rid­den the Pani­gale V4 S, I find the Street­fighter’s agility and</p>
    <p>Winglets (above) on the side of the ra­di­a­tor of the 2020 Du­cati Street­fighter give the bike down­force that en­hances straight-line sta­bil­ity in high-speed runs. brak­ing prow­ess are sim­i­lar to the su­per­bike’s, but the naked bike turns a tad slower.</p>
    <p>With­out a large wind­screen, you will get the full onslaught of head wind at higher speeds. Also, like most big-ca­pac­ity mo­tor­cy­cles, ex­pect thigh-roast­ing heat from the en­gine.</p>
