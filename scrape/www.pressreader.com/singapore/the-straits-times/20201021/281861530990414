    <p>WASHINGTON The United States Jus­tice Depart­ment and 11 states filed an an­titrust law­suit against Al­pha­bet’s Google yes­ter­day for al­legedly break­ing the law in us­ing its mar­ket power to fend off ri­vals, and called for ac­tion.</p>
    <p>The law­suit marks the big­gest anti trust case in a gen­er­a­tion, com­pa­ra­ble to the law­suit against Mi­crosoft filed in 1998, and the 1974 case against AT&T which led to the break-up of the Bell Sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The law­suit claims that Google acted un­law­fully to main­tain its po­si­tion in search and search ad­ver­tis­ing on the In­ter­net. It states that “ab­sent a court or­der, Google will con­tinue ex­e­cut­ing its anti-com­pet­i­tive strat­egy, crip­pling the com­pet­i­tive process, re­duc­ing con­sumer choice, and sti­fling in­no­va­tion”.</p>
    <p>“Google is now the un­chal­lenged gate­way to the In­ter­net for bil­lions of users world­wide...</p>
    <p>“For the sake of Amer­i­can con­sumers, ad­ver­tis­ers and all com­pa­nies now re­liant on the In­ter­net econ­omy, the time has come to stop Google’s anti-com­pet­i­tive con­duct and re­store com­pe­ti­tion.”</p>
    <p>When asked on a con­fer­ence call what spe­cific ac­tion should be taken, a Jus­tice Depart­ment of­fi­cial said: “Noth­ing is off the ta­ble.”</p>
    <p>Google, whose search en­gine is so ubiq­ui­tous that its name has be­come a verb, did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment. The com­pany had rev­enue of US$162 bil­lion (S$219.75 bil­lion) last year, more than the na­tion of Hun­gary.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­can Se­na­tor Josh Haw­ley, a vo­cif­er­ous Google critic, ac­cused the com­pany of keep­ing power through “il­le­gal means” and called the law­suit “the most im­por­tant anti trust case in a gen­er­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>The Mi­crosoft law­suit was cred­ited with clear­ing the way for the ex­plo­sive growth of the In­ter­net since the an­titrust scru­tiny pre­vented the com­pany from at­tempt­ing to thwart com­peti­tors.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s fed­eral law­suit marks a rare mo­ment of agree­ment be­tween the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion and pro­gres­sive Democrats.</p>
    <p>Mas­sachusetts Se­na­tor El­iz­a­beth War­ren tweeted on Sept 10, us­ing the hash tag #BreakUpBig­Tech, that she wanted “swift, ag­gres­sive ac­tion”.</p>
    <p>Com­ing just weeks be­fore the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, the fil­ing’s tim­ing could be seen as a po­lit­i­cal ges­ture since it ful­fils a promise made by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump to his sup­port­ers to hold cer­tain com­pa­nies to ac­count for al­legedly sti­fling con­ser­va­tive voices.</p>
    <p>More law­suits could be in the off­ing, since probes by state at­tor­neys-gen­eral into Google’s broader busi­nesses are un­der way, as well as an in­ves­ti­ga­tion of its broader dig­i­tal ad­ver­tis­ing busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s law­suit comes more than a year af­ter the Jus­tice Depart­ment and Fed­eral Trade Com­mis­sion be­gan an­titrust in­ves­ti­ga­tions into four big tech com­pa­nies: Ama­zon.com, Ap­ple, Face­book and Google.</p>
