    <p>COM­PET­ING FOR TAL­ENT</p>
    <p>But as much as he wants to hire tal­ents that are al­ready here, in­clud­ing lo­cals, this is not al­ways a pos­si­bil­ity, Mr Tan says, high­light­ing that top lo­cal grad­u­ates in re­lated fields like com­puter sci­ence and engi­neer­ing would of­ten plump for jobs in large lo­cal firms like DBS Bank and Sin­ga­pore Air­lines, or multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>“How do SMEs like us com­pete for the same tal­ent?” he asks, cit­ing the large em­ploy­ment pack­ages and more com­pre­hen­sive ben­e­fits these larger play­ers can of­fer.</p>
    <p>But Mr Tan ac­knowl­edges that it is hard to gen­er­alise hir­ing prac­tices for dif­fer­ent in­dus­tries and their spe­cific needs.</p>
    <p>The fi­nance sec­tor – a rare bright spot where growth con­tin­ues to be recorded this year de­spite an over­all tum­ble in Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy – is another sec­tor, be­sides tech, about which Sin­ga­pore­ans have ex­pressed con­cern over a per­ceived over-pop­u­la­tion of for­eign man­power.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing the is­sue last week, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung, a board mem­ber of the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS), pointed to the sta­bil­ity of the pro­por­tion of for­eign­ers in the sec­tor in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>About 70 per cent of the 171,000 work­ers in the sec­tor are Sin­ga­pore­ans, 14 per cent are PRs, and 16 per cent are work pass hold­ers.</p>
    <p>The pro­por­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans in se­nior roles is lower, at 44 per cent. About a fifth of se­nior po­si­tions are held by PRs, and the re­main­ing 36 per cent go­ing to work pass hold­ers.</p>
    <p>“The higher share of for­eign­ers in se­nior roles is mainly due to the large in­ter­na­tional com­po­nent of the ac­tiv­i­ties that we now have in our fi­nan­cial cen­tre,” Mr Ong said.</p>
    <p>And Sin­ga­pore­ans are ben­e­fit­ing from this, even if they may not be sit­ting in the ma­jor­ity of top roles at fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions, as they “gain pre­cious global and re­gional ex­per­tise”, he added.</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore­ans ac­knowl­edge that there are roles which they may not have the req­ui­site skills to fill, much of the anger arises when they lose out in the com­pe­ti­tion for jobs they be­lieve are within their ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Joshua Yim, chief ex­ec­u­tive of re­cruit­ing firm Achieve Group, points out how there are some MNCs where less spe­cialised roles like hu­man re­sources, ad­min­is­tra­tive ser­vices and fi­nance con­tinue to be filled by for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>“It could be due to the pref­er­ence of se­nior ex­ec­u­tives, or fa­mil­iar­ity with cer­tain in­di­vid­u­als they have worked with in the past,” he says, not­ing the sub­jec­tiv­ity of such de­ci­sions taken.</p>
    <p>But there is scope to pro­tect the in­ter­ests of Sin­ga­porean work­ers here, says Mr Yim, sug­gest­ing a reg­u­la­tory frame­work which is more tar­geted and un­der which lo­cal work­ers could be pre­ferred for sup­port­ing roles.</p>
    <p>Mr Dainial Sani Lim, group di­rec­tor of im­mi­gra­tion con­sul­tancy Cay­man Group Hold­ings, sug­gests that lo­cal job seek­ers are passed over be­cause their de­mands are too high.</p>
    <p>“If you ask SMEs, busi­ness own­ers... they have been try­ing to find peo­ple, (but they) can’t get good lo­cals to take on the jobs,” he says.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with some for­eign­ers, lo­cal job seek­ers ex­pect “cer­tain de­gree of al­lowances and pay”, and may be less will­ing to ac­cept of­fers with lower lev­els of ben­e­fits, Mr Lim adds.</p>
