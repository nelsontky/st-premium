    <p>The an­nounce­ment ear­lier this month that five black-and-white bun­ga­lows in Rochester Park will house re­tail and food out­lets as part of the new Rochester Com­mons to be com­pleted late next year was news to many.</p>
    <p>They had been oc­cu­pied by restau­rants since 2006 in one of the first food and bev­er­age en­claves housed in colo­nial build­ings out­side the city.</p>
    <p>When they were taken back in 2018 for re­de­vel­op­ment, tenants were given to un­der­stand that the new plans did not in­clude eater­ies and the build­ings would be used as of­fices and train­ing cen­tres in­stead.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, for­mer tenants have ei­ther closed down or moved to new premises.</p>
    <p>Span­ish restau­rant Una, which be­gan life as a bar called One Rochester in the first bun­ga­low, is now at Alkaff Man­sion.</p>
    <p>Both Chi­nese restau­rant Min Jiang One-North (at No. 5) and Ital­ian eatery Da Paolo Bistro Bar (No. 3) have opened new out­lets in the Dempsey area. And Beer­fest Mi­cro­brew­ery Restau­rant (No. 4) moved to Rochester Drive just a stone’s throw away. North Bor­der Bar And Grill, which oc­cu­pied No. 2, closed down in 2017.</p>
    <p>Min Jiang One-North was one of the pi­o­neers that opened in early 2006. It was the first in­de­pen­dent restau­rant by the Good­wood Park Ho­tel, which al­ready had an in-house Sichuan restau­rant called Min Jiang.</p>
    <p>The Rochester Park out­let served a slightly dif­fer­ent menu and one of its spe­cial­i­ties was a Wood-Fired</p>
    <p>Pek­ing Duck roasted with cherry wood in a cus­tom-built oven, a first in Sin­ga­pore. It also in­tro­duced the Bei­jing way of serv­ing the bird with gran­u­lated sugar and other condi­ments, in­stead of the Hong Kong style with just sweet sauce.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the ho­tel said busi­ness was good dur­ing its 13-year ten­ure.</p>
    <p>She added: “The restau­rant fared a lit­tle bet­ter for lunch on week­days be­cause of the cor­po­rate of­fices around the area. But it was busiest from Fri­days to Sun­days with mostly fam­i­lies for both lunch and din­ner.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, the ris­ing pop­u­lar­ity of other des­ti­na­tion life­style con­cepts in the later years did have some im­pact on our busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>The 3,000 sq ft two-storey bun­ga­low, which had an al­fresco din­ing area, was also a pop­u­lar venue for cel­e­bra­tions and wed­dings as it had a ro­man­tic am­bi­ence, she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Chan So Ei, who was the man­ager there and now runs the Dempsey out­let, rem­i­nisced: “The restau­rant team and I will al­ways re­mem­ber how tran­quil the set­ting was. With so many trees in the area, we felt that we were sur­rounded by na­ture and it was a nice change from the city cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause we were housed in a bun­ga­low, many guests also com­mented that it felt like a cosy home­din­ing ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>But the lo­ca­tion had its chal­lenges, among them limited park­ing spa­ces in the vicin­ity.</p>
    <p>The walk to the restau­rant and the al­fresco area were both ex­posed to the el­e­ments. When it rained, there would be more can­cel­la­tions, said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>On whether Good­wood Park would con­sider bid­ding for a</p>
    <p>Rochester Park bun­ga­low again, she said that with Min Jiang at Dempsey open­ing only last year, the ho­tel has no plans for a third out­let.</p>
    <p>For­mer neigh­bour Beer­fest, which is known for Slavic and Ger­man dishes such as crispy pork knuckle and brews its own cher­ryflavoure­d beer, would not say if it in­tended to re­turn to Rochester Park.</p>
    <p>But it ap­pears un­likely as its spokesman said busi­ness at its cur­rent out­let at 39 Rochester Drive, which is con­nected to the ad­ja­cent Rochester Mall, drew a bet­ter crowd, at least be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic. It moved early this year af­ter six years at Rochester Park.</p>
    <p>The mi­cro­brew­ery and restau­rant orig­i­nated in Rus­sia, where it has five out­lets. The com­pany also owns an out­let each in Viet­nam and Thai­land.</p>
    <p>Da Paolo and Una de­clined to be in­ter­viewed, with the lat­ter say­ing it was too early to make plans.</p>
