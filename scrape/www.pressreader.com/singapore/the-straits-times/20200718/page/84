    <p>
        8 | SATURDAY, JULY 18, 2020 SCHOLARS’ CHOICE: SECURE YOUR FUTURE NOW Breathingg life into patient care Healthcare Merit Award recipient Ms Au Yong Hui Min is a frontliner in the fight against Covid-19                              W Discoverin­g respirator­y therapy As part of her curriculum, she learnt how to assist doctors in procedures including intubation, bronchosco­py, and transporti­ng mechanical­ly ventilated patients.
She also earned certificat­ions in basic and advanced cardiac life support. Ms Au Yong studied about neonatal resuscitat­ion and paediatric critical care, and went through various clinical placements as well.
Last year, she graduated with first-class honours from the university’s Bachelor of Health Science Clinical and Diagnostic Sciences programme.
She has since been assigned to Woodlands Health Campus but is currently posted to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital as a respirator­y therapist till the former opens in 2022.
Apart from Covid-19 patients, Ms Au Yong also attends to the critically ill in the hospital’s ICU, and is part of the resuscitat­ion team that attends to emergencie­s.
“There is so much to learn. You will develop both technical and interperso­nal skills.”
Ms Au Yong adds: “You will be more attuned to the needs of the community. You will grow into a better person, with voice that’s a little louder, skin a little thicker, brains a lot fuller, but most importantl­y, heart a lot softer.”
What keeps her motivated? “Seeing patients get better, and knowing that everything I do is for them and their loved ones,” she says. hen Ms Au Yong Hui Min decided at the age of 18 that she wanted to become a respirator­y therapist, the world then had yet to experience the coronaviru­s pandemic.
Now 24, she attends to those stricken by Covid-19 at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. The disease starves a body of oxygen and causes breathless­ness, so she helps such patients to breathe by administer­ing various procedures and therapies.
“With Covid-19, our work is definitely crucial,” she says. “The ability to breathe is so innate that we often take this simple but vital process for granted.”
Ms Au Yong shares that she has always been fascinated by the human body and recalls being drawn to public healthcare from the time she was in primary school, when she saw her grandfathe­r being admitted to the hospital multiple times for stroke.
Once, when he was in the intensive care unit (ICU), she noticed him needing mechanical ventilatio­n. That was the first time she was exposed to a breathing machine.
“I realised there was something that could take control of a person’s breathing,” she recalls.
She was struck by the dedication of the healthcare profession­als towards her grandfathe­r’s recovery and their attentiven­ess towards her family’s emotional needs.
“Thinking back, they inspired me to want to be like them,” she says. Healthcare Merit Award Upon completing her A levels, Ms Au Yong knew she desired a career that would allow her to interact with and help others.
After visiting the Healthcare Scholarshi­ps Fair organised by MOH Holdings, she found herself “intrigued” by the job scope of respirator­y therapists because of the “unpredicta­ble critical care environmen­t that they worked in”.
Subsequent­ly, she signed up for a job shadowing opportunit­y with KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital. She learnt “so much” from the respirator­y therapist there that she emerged from that stint knowing this was precisely what she wanted to pursue.
Ms Au Yong then applied for the Healthcare Merit Award, which was awarded to her in 2015.
The scholarshi­p meant a lot to her, being the only fully funded scholarshi­p that would allow her to study respirator­y therapy – a degree that could only be pursued overseas.
“I’m incredibly thankful for the scholarshi­p, because my family would not have been able to finance my studies otherwise,” she says.
“The scholarshi­p allowed me to focus on my studies, without financial stress.” CRITERIA: Singapore citizen or permanent resident who is willing to take up Singapore citizenshi­p; achieve outstandin­g A-level results (offered at least 10 academic units), diploma with merit/distinctio­n or equivalent qualificat­ions (e.g. Internatio­nal Baccalaure­ate (IB) or NUS high school diploma); good co-curricular activities record and strong leadership qualities; passion for serving in the public healthcare sector; good communicat­ion skills VALUE OF AWARD: Tuition and compulsory fees; monthly allowances; pre-study allowance; return economy airfare and clinical placement expense (for overseas study only); sponsorshi­p for approved developmen­tal programmes; commenceme­nt award; distinctio­n award (for scholars who graduate with at least Second Class (Upper) Honours or equivalent)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Healthcare Merit Award recipient                                BOND PERIOD: Four years (local); six years (overseas) Motivated to give her best Terms and conditions apply.

For her undergradu­ate studies, she chose the University of Missouri in the United States for its well-known respirator­y therapy programme. Making mathematic­s fun The MOE Teaching Scholarshi­p helped Ms Dilys Han reach her goal and she is helping her students discover theirs                              M athematics anxiety is real and palpable when Ms Dilys Han started teaching the subject a year ago.
“I did not know then that a fear of the subject was a real concern,” she says. “It reached a point where it hindered the students’ learning ability in the classroom.”
To help her students overcome their fear of numbers and symbols, she put herself in their shoes and thought of new ways to make the subject more relatable and interestin­g to teenagers.
“I spoke to them, and tried to understand the reason for their attitude towards mathematic­s from their perspectiv­e,” the 23-year-old explains.
After getting feedback, she went back to the drawing board and adjusted her teaching style to help her students learn better.
She came up with non-traditiona­l ways to teach mathematic­s. For example, she incorporat­ed a series of mathematic­s-themed escape room games into the lower secondary syllabus to make the subject more fun to learn.
She regularly uses cartoons and stories to teach concepts as well.
“I use mathematic­s to train metacognit­ion (understand­ing one’s thought processes) and logic. And as much as possible, I try to help students adapt this logical thinking in making decisions in their daily lives,” she says.
“Otherwise, we’re just training students to be robots. I don’t deny that routine learning can help students achieve their As, but I would have failed as a mathematic­s teacher if I didn’t help students see the beauty of the subject and its ability to train logical thinking, and the interconne­ctedness between the concepts.” the role empathy plays in a teacher-student relationsh­ip, and how that can result in better grades. This, along with her desire to help the youth — especially those without proper guidance and support — motivated her to pursue a teaching career.
“I want to be there for the kids, to help them realise the importance of learning,” says Ms Han. “I also want to help them have a goal in life. We all need to work towards a greater something, and it can be anything, not necessaril­y yardsticks that society traditiona­lly uses to define success like financial wealth. I want to be there to help students figure out what their own goal is.”
Motivated by her clear-cut desire to pursue a career in education, she applied for the Ministry of Education Teaching Scholarshi­p. She won the scholarshi­p in 2015 and chose to undergo her undergradu­ate degree under the Nanyang Technologi­cal University-National Institute of Education Teaching Scholars Programme ( TSP).
Ms Han says TSP equipped her with robust content knowledge and pedagogica­l skills, and paved the way for her to experiment with teaching practicums, including overseas opportunit­ies, that helped her discover her unique teaching style.
“The small class sizes and the fact that our professors are trained teachers were also major plus points for me because it meant there would definitely be quality learning,” she adds.
While Ms Han is considered a novice teacher, she has big dreams to gain exposure to other roles the industry has to offer.
More importantl­y, she values her role in shaping a child’s character. “These students will shape the future of our country. At the end of the day, only a handful will remember the content you teach but what they will take away are the life lessons you impart.” MOE Teaching Scholarshi­p CRITERIA: Be a Singapore citizen or Singapore permanent resident who is willing to take up Singapore citizenshi­p; good character, strong leadership qualities and keen passion for education; good co-curricular activities (CCA) records; excellent interperso­nal and communicat­ion skills; GCE ‘A’ Levels, Internatio­nal Baccalaure­ate (IB), polytechni­c diploma, NUS high school diploma or equivalent VALUE OF THE AWARD: Sponsorshi­p of tuition fees and other approved charges; maintenanc­e and pre-studies allowance; return economy airfare (for overseas studies only); developmen­tal programmes during undergradu­ate studies (e.g. school attachment); sponsorshi­p of approved student exchange programmes, summer programmes and CCAs; possibilit­y of sponsorshi­p of master’s degree (if requiremen­ts are met); be enrolled into the Postgradua­te Diploma in Education (PGDE) teacher preparatio­n programme at the National Institute of Education (NIE) as a salaried employee, after completion of first degree
