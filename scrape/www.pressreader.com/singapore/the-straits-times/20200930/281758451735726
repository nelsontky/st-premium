    <p>Test kits that can de­ter­mine if a per­son has Covid-19 in min­utes are not be­ing used in na­tional swab­bing ex­er­cises in Sin­ga­pore as they are not sen­si­tive enough to de­tect ev­ery in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ray­mond Lin, di­rec­tor of the Na­tional Public Health Lab­o­ra­tory at the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases (NCID), told The Straits Times ear­lier this month that this was be­cause rapid tests can give false neg­a­tive re­sults, miss­ing true cases.</p>
    <p>Prof Lin said then: “Cur­rently avail­able anti­gen rapid test kits can miss as many as one in six cases, or even more. If we miss cases, we will have more out­breaks.”</p>
    <p>The NCID will con­tinue to look for test kits that are fast and ac­cu­rate, he added.</p>
    <p>More than 120 Covid-19 di­ag­nos­tic test kits have re­ceived pro­vi­sional au­tho­ri­sa­tion from the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity, rang­ing from poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) kits to anti­gen and serol­ogy ones.</p>
    <p>All three work dif­fer­ently.</p>
    <p>PCR tests look for frag­ments of the virus’ ge­netic ma­te­rial in a pa­tient sam­ple and are con­sid­ered the “gold stan­dard” test for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>But the en­tire process – from swab­bing a pa­tient to send­ing the sam­ple to a lab­o­ra­tory and the PCR process it­self – can take up to a day.</p>
    <p>It can also be costly, and re­quires trained per­son­nel and spe­cialised equip­ment to ad­min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Anti­gen test kits, on the other hand, are pointof-care tests that look for pro­teins on the virus sur­face and can yield quick re­sults, usu­ally within min­utes.</p>
    <p>Serol­ogy tests, which de­tect the pres­ence of an­ti­bod­ies, are mainly used to tell if a per­son has been in­fected in the past, and not to di­ag­nose pa­tients.</p>
    <p>How­ever, ex­perts have noted that be­cause rapid di­ag­nos­tic tests are cheaper and less in­va­sive than PCR tests, their pru­dent and re­peated de­ploy­ment could sup­ple­ment na­tional mea­sures to con­trol Covid-19.</p>
