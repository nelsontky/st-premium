    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia will en­force the min­i­mum hous­ing stan­dards for mi­grant work­ers from to­day, Se­nior Min­is­ter (de­fence clus­ter) Is­mail Sabri Yaakob said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>His com­ments fol­lowed a surge of in­fec­tions in Se­lan­gor dor­mi­to­ries and fac­to­ries run by the world’s largest pro­ducer of rub­ber gloves Top Glove, which pushed Malaysia to re­port record daily in­fec­tions on Tues­day. To­tal new cases dropped to 970 yes­ter­day from 2,188 the pre­vi­ous day.</p>
    <p>“There is one fac­tory in our coun­try that has re­ceived fairly poor com­ments from in­ter­na­tional bod­ies for plac­ing work­ers in crowded con­di­tions,” Datuk Seri Is­mail Sabri told re­porters at his reg­u­lar Covid-19 brief­ings, as quoted by Malaysi­akini news site. “So, this Act will pro­vide for more com­fort­able con­di­tions for the work­ers.”</p>
    <p>He did not name the com­pany or the in­ter­na­tional bod­ies con­cerned.</p>
    <p>He said that em­ploy­ers who fail to pro­vide proper hous­ing can face stiff penal­ties of up to RM50,000 (S$16,400) per worker un­der the Work­ers’ Min­i­mum Stan­dards of Hous­ing and Ameni­ties Act 1990.</p>
    <p>Mr Is­mail Sabri said the en­force­ment ac­tion by the Hu­man Re­sources Min­istry on “ev­ery em­ployer” will be­gin to­day.</p>
    <p>Malaysia has two mil­lion for­eign labour­ers work­ing legally in the coun­try, and more than two mil­lion oth­ers who are un­doc­u­mented mi­grants.</p>
    <p>Apart from man­u­fac­tur­ing plants, for­eign labour is found in palm plan­ta­tions and at con­struc­tion sites. They also work in other blue-col­lar jobs such as of­fice clean­ers, restau­rant helpers and as maids in homes.</p>
    <p>The Ter­atai clus­ter around Top Glove’s fa­cil­i­ties in the town of Meru got its name from Jalan Ter­atai where the com­pany’s 28 fac­to­ries and dor­mi­to­ries are lo­cated.</p>
    <p>The Ter­atai clus­ter first emerged on Nov 7 and now has more than 4,000 cases, with some 80 per cent of these in­volv­ing for­eign work­ers.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil, which co­or­di­nates work on tamp­ing down Covid-19, on Mon­day de­cided that Top Glove must close its fa­cil­i­ties in stages for health checks and dis­in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Said Hu­man Re­sources Min­is­ter M. Sar­a­vanan: “We are not merely send­ing a team to check on the con­di­tions at Top Glove. It will be the en­tire Labour Depart­ment.</p>
    <p>“We will com­plete ev­ery­thing within a week and will put ev­ery­thing in black and white.”</p>
    <p>He added, as quoted by The Star daily: “This is a mat­ter of life and death of vul­ner­a­ble work­ers, which must be con­tained now it­self – no two ways about it.”</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Sar­a­vanan, who had vis­ited Top Glove’s plant sev­eral days ear­lier with Labour Depart­ment of­fi­cers, said the work­ers’ hous­ing con­di­tions were de­plorable.</p>
    <p>“I have vis­ited the hos­tels and the con­di­tions are ter­ri­ble. My of­fi­cers were or­dered to go in full force as this is a big, vul­ner­a­ble mi­grant work­ers colony.</p>
    <p>“If we don’t act, this clus­ter might get out of con­trol,” Mr Sar­a­vanan said.</p>
    <p>In pho­tos and video clips pro­vided by the min­is­ter, the hos­tels look over­crowded and un­san­i­tary, The Star re­ported.</p>
    <p>In July, two Top Glove sub­sidiaries were slapped with an im­port ban by the US Cus­toms and Border Pro­tec­tion over al­le­ga­tions of forced labour.</p>
    <p>In its re­ply on Oct 24, Top Glove said it has re­solved is­sues high­lighted by the US Depart­ment of Labour.</p>
    <p>Malaysian res­i­dents around the Top Glove fa­cil­i­ties said they are scared to leave their homes due to the high num­ber of cases.</p>
    <p>Said Mrs S. Ganeswary, a mother of two: “I take ev­ery pre­cau­tion pos­si­ble like wear­ing a mask and wash­ing my hands reg­u­larly, but there is still the nag­ging feel­ing that I too can get in­fected.”</p>
