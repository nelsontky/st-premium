    <p>Kep­pel Corp is look­ing to sell about $3 bil­lion to $5 bil­lion worth of as­sets over the next three years and re­de­ploy the funds to seize new op­por­tu­ni­ties and im­prove re­turns.</p>
    <p>The move comes as the firm ex­e­cutes long-term plans to build growth en­gines for the fu­ture, said Kep­pel chief ex­ec­u­tive Loh Chin Hua at a vir­tual brief­ing yesterday.</p>
    <p>“As we pur­sue our growth ini­tia­tives in data cen­tres, en­vi­ron­men­tal so­lu­tions, re­new­able en­ergy, in­te­grated ur­ban de­vel­op­ment and as­set man­age­ment, we will also need to re­view our busi­ness port­fo­lio from time to time,” added Mr Loh, who did not dis­close the seg­ments ear­marked for as­set dis­posal.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel, one of the world’s largest oil-rig mak­ers, said it has iden­ti­fied as­sets with a to­tal car­ry­ing value of about $17.5 bil­lion as at June 30 that could be sold off over time with the pro­ceeds chan­nelled to­wards growth ini­tia­tives, with­out chang­ing the busi­nesses that it runs.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude the group’s land­bank, de­vel­op­ment projects, var­i­ous funds and in­vest­ments as well as non-core as­sets such as Kep­pel Off­shore & Ma­rine’s (O&M) oil rigs.</p>
    <p>Mr Loh de­clined to share more de­tails on th­ese as­sets that have been iden­ti­fied, cit­ing com­mer­cial sen­si­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>They do not in­clude key busi­ness plat­forms, fixed as­sets such as Kep­pel O&M’s yards or some of the group’s units in real es­tate or other in­vest­ment trusts.</p>
    <p>While Kep­pel will seek to mon­e­tise all $17.5 bil­lion worth of as­sets over time, of which $3 bil­lion to $5 bil­lion will be done in the next three years, not all of the as­sets will be di­vested and it will con­sider other op­por­tu­ni­ties as well, it said.</p>
    <p>As well as the as­set sales, Kep­pel Corp is run­ning the rule over its off­shore and ma­rine busi­ness amid a chal­leng­ing en­vi­ron­ment for the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Its op­tions in­clude re­view­ing Kep­pel O&M’s busi­ness model, as­sess­ing its ca­pac­ity and global network of yards, re­struc­tur­ing to seek op­por­tu­ni­ties as a de­vel­oper of re­new­able en­ergy as­sets, as well as merg­ers and as­set sales.</p>
    <p>The re­view is be­ing car­ried out as a “very im­me­di­ate task” and all op­tions will be con­sid­ered, said Mr Loh, who noted that the ex­er­cise is aimed at max­imis­ing long-term share­holder value.</p>
    <p>While the process is still at a “very pre­lim­i­nary stage”, he said that “it should not take years; it could take months”.</p>
    <p>Mr Loh did not com­ment on spe­cific plans that are part of the re­view, in­clud­ing a ques­tion on whether a po­ten­tial merger with Sem­b­corp Ma­rine was on the cards.</p>
    <p>His com­ments came as Kep­pel reaf­firmed the Vi­sion 2030 road map un­veiled in May that out­lined the com­pany’s fo­cus on four key ar­eas – en­ergy and en­vi­ron­ment, ur­ban de­vel­op­ment, con­nec­tiv­ity and as­set man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel’s ac­cel­er­ated im­ple­men­ta­tion of Vi­sion 2030 comes after Sin­ga­pore in­vest­ment com­pany Te­masek, which is its sin­gle largest share­holder, pulled out of its $4.1 bil­lion par­tial of­fer to gain con­trol of the firm last month, in the light of its poor fi­nan­cial show­ing.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel is run­ning the rule over its off­shore and ma­rine busi­ness amid a chal­leng­ing en­vi­ron­ment for the sec­tor. Its op­tions in­clude re­view­ing Kep­pel O&M’s busi­ness model, as­sess­ing its ca­pac­ity and global network of yards, re­struc­tur­ing to seek op­por­tu­ni­ties as a de­vel­oper of re­new­able en­ergy as­sets, as well as merg­ers and as­set sales.</p>
