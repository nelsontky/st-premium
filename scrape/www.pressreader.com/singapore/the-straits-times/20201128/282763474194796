    <p>LONDON • The re­turn of fans, al­beit severely re­stricted, for se­lect Pre­mier League clubs has drawn a mixed re­ac­tion from man­agers.</p>
    <p>With a month-long na­tional lock­down to con­tain the spread of the coro­n­avirus set to be lifted on Wed­nes­day, the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment has said up to 4,000 fans can at­tend out­door elite sports events, in­clud­ing English top-flight games, in the low­est-risk medium alert ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Pre­mier League clubs in London and Liver­pool can wel­come up to 2,000 fans as they fall un­der the high alert Tier 2 zone. But the Manch­ester teams, City and United, and Leeds and oth­ers in the Mid­lands and north will have to wait longer as their ar­eas have been clas­si­fied as be­long­ing to the very high alert Tier 3 zone.</p>
    <p>Arse­nal’s Europa League tie with Rapid Vi­enna on Thurs­day will be the first foot­ball game held in Bri­tain to have fans back since March, when the Pre­mier League was halted for three months be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Sup­port­ers can at­tend top-flight games that same week­end, but with the re­stric­tions es­sen­tially block­ing 10 out of the 20 Pre­mier League clubs, Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa be­lieves it is an un­fair sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“Per­haps there could be a rule that states that if fans are not al­lowed in all sta­di­ums, then they should not be al­lowed in at all un­til ev­ery­body is al­lowed to have them in,” the Argentinia­n told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“It shouldn’t be about the cat­e­gory, or the con­se­quences of be­ing in a cat­e­gory, it should be about try­ing to main­tain the com­pe­ti­tion as equal as pos­si­ble with things that are con­trol­lable.</p>
    <p>“The pres­ence of the fans has an ef­fect on the re­sults. What the or­gan­i­sa­tion says is peo­ple who are from places where there’s a higher risk of in­fec­tion will be pe­nalised.”</p>
    <p>But not ev­ery­one shared Bielsa’s view.</p>
    <p>New­cas­tle man­ager Steve Bruce, whose club also can­not host any fans, ap­pre­ci­ated the “small ges­ture” but ques­tioned the max­i­mum limit as the size of sta­di­ums was not be­ing taken into ac­count.</p>
    <p>“I can un­der­stand 4,000 fans if it’s an 8,000-seat sta­dium but what I can’t quite di­gest at the mo­ment is why only 4,000 or 2,000 when we’ve got the ca­pac­ity to... com­fort­ably put 15,000 to 20,000 peo­ple in,” he said.</p>
    <p>Crys­tal Palace boss Roy Hodg­son, whose side can wel­come sup­port­ers, added a crowd of 2,000 was not enough to be a dif­fer­en­ti­at­ing fac­tor.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think 2,000 fans in a sta­dium will make a size­able dif­fer­ence in terms of fair com­pe­ti­tion,” he said. “It is more a mat­ter of it be­ing such a great thing for the fans to en­joy.”</p>
