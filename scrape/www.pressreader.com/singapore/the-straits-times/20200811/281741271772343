    <p>SYD­NEY • Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son said yes­ter­day that in­ter­nal bor­der clo­sures were un­likely to be lifted be­fore Christ­mas, as the na­tion re­ported a record sin­gle-day rise in Covid-19 deaths.</p>
    <p>There was, how­ever, some ev­i­dence that dras­tic lock­down mea­sures in the city of Mel­bourne were hav­ing an ef­fect, with daily new in­fec­tions in the state of Vic­to­ria slow­ing to a near two-week low.</p>
    <p>“I am more hope­ful of that to­day than I was in the course of the past week,” Mr Mor­ri­son said, as he urged state leaders to co­op­er­ate to let stranded res­i­dents re­turn home.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s fed­eral po­lit­i­cal sys­tem has led to its eight states and ter­ri­to­ries tak­ing dif­fer­ent mea­sures in re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus cri­sis, re­sult­ing in sev­eral in­ter­nal bor­der clo­sures.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria state, home to Mel­bourne, the coun­try’s sec­ond-big­gest city and epi­cen­tre of its sec­ond coro­n­avirus wave, re­ported 19 deaths from the virus over the past 24 hours. With other states still to re­port daily num­bers, that al­ready marks the coun­try’s big­gest sin­gle­day rise in fa­tal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>But Vic­to­ria of­fi­cials also re­ported 322 new in­fec­tions in the last 24 hours, the low­est sin­gle-day rise in cases since July 29.</p>
    <p>“This is an agonising day for the mem­bers of the 19 fam­i­lies who have lost a loved one to Covid-19 to­day,” said Aus­tralia’s deputy chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer Michael Kidd.</p>
    <p>“We are now see­ing the first promis­ing signs of a sig­nif­i­cant de­cline in the num­ber of cases.”</p>
    <p>The slow­down in cases comes more than a month af­ter the nearly five mil­lion res­i­dents of Mel­bourne, the cap­i­tal of Vic­to­ria, were told to stay home in a strict lock­down, and a week af­ter most busi­nesses in the city were or­dered to close in an at­tempt to slow the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>State Premier Daniel An­drews said yes­ter­day that he un­der­stood frus­tra­tions, but de­clined to put an end date on the lock­down. “If I could paint you a pic­ture that had any kind of re­li­a­bil­ity for next week, let alone five weeks away, then, of course, I would,” said Mr An­drews.</p>
    <p>With more than 21,000 Covid-19 cases and 314 deaths, Aus­tralia has still recorded fewer in­fec­tions and fa­tal­i­ties than many other de­vel­oped na­tions.</p>
    <p>It was con­sid­ered a global leader early in the pan­demic when it swiftly shut its in­ter­na­tional bor­ders, im­posed so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules and im­ple­mented mass virus test­ing. But as the coun­try be­gan to re­open, com­mu­nity trans­mis­sions rose sig­nif­i­cantly in Vic­to­ria, where triple-digit daily new cases have now been recorded for weeks.</p>
    <p>Out­side the two largest states of Vic­to­ria and New South Wales, the virus has been ef­fec­tively elim­i­nated, though the au­thor­i­ties still worry that the spike in Vic­to­ria has al­ready spread to other states de­spite bor­der clo­sures.</p>
    <p>New South Wales re­ported 14 new cases and no deaths yes­ter­day. Twelve cases were linked to known clus­ters, while an­other was a per­son in ho­tel quar­an­tine af­ter re­turn­ing from over­seas, leav­ing one case with no known links.</p>
    <p>So­cial dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions have dev­as­tated Aus­tralia’s econ­omy. Unem­ploy­ment is ex­pected to peak at 14 per cent this year as the coun­try en­ters its first re­ces­sion in nearly three decades.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment last week pledged to ex­pand its wage sub­sidy scheme by A$16.8 bil­lion (S$16.5 bil­lion), prompt­ing crit­i­cism that the eco­nomic toll was too high.</p>
    <p>But Mr Mor­ri­son said the al­ter­na­tive was un­think­able.</p>
    <p>“There have been some sug­ges­tions... that some­how our el­derly should in some way have been of­fered up in re­la­tion to this virus,” he said. “That is a just hideous thought. An ab­so­lutely amoral, hideous thought.” dif­fi­cult mo­ment for the world.</p>
    <p>“But I want to be clear: There are green shoots of hope and... it is never too late to turn the out­break around.”</p>
    <p>Dr Te­dros gave ex­am­ples of coun­tries that had suc­cess­fully clamped down on the spread of the virus, cit­ing New Zealand and Rwanda.</p>
    <p>He also praised Bri­tain and France for tak­ing swift re­cent mea­sures to tackle new spikes, such as im­pos­ing lock­downs around clus­ters in north­ern Eng­land and mak­ing masks com­pul­sory in busy out­door spa­ces in Paris.</p>
    <p>“My message is crys­tal clear: Sup­press, sup­press, sup­press the virus,” he said. “If we sup­press the virus ef­fec­tively, we can safely open up so­ci­eties.”</p>
    <p>Dr Mike Ryan, head of the WHO’s emer­gen­cies pro­gramme, said at the vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day that the global health agency trusts pow­er­ful na­tions like those in the Group of Seven (G-7) to reach a con­sen­sus on how to ap­proach health crises such as the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>France and Ger­many have quit talks on re­form­ing the WHO in frus­tra­tion at at­tempts by the United States to lead the ne­go­ti­a­tions de­spite its de­ci­sion to leave the health agency, three of­fi­cials told Reuters.</p>
    <p>The move is a set­back for US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump as Wash­ing­ton, which holds the ro­tat­ing chair of the G-7, had hoped to is­sue a joint road map for a sweep­ing over­haul of the WHO next month, two months be­fore the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“We are all vul­ner­a­ble to risks, we need to find global so­lu­tions,” Dr Ryan said. “We trust the G-7 will play a ma­jor part in that in the months and years to come.”</p>
