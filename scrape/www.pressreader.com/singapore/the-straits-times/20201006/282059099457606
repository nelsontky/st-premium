    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) will re­view its frame­work of penalties for em­ploy­ers who il­le­gally de­ploy their maids.</p>
    <p>Ac­tion will be taken against em­ploy­ers in cases sim­i­lar to the one in­volv­ing for­mer maid Parti Liyani, re­gard­less of whether they are aware of the il­le­gal de­ploy­ment, said Min­is­ter of State for Man­power Gan Siow Huang yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“This is to re­mind the em­ploy­ers that they are ul­ti­mately ac­count­able for their for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers, and should take steps to en­sure that their house­holds’ de­ploy­ment of the for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers does not con­tra­vene the law,” she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Gan was re­spond­ing to Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Pung­gol GRC) on the con­sid­er­a­tions be­hind the MOM’s ac­tion against Ms Parti’s em­ployer – for­mer Changi Air­port Group chair­man Liew Mun Leong – over her il­le­gal de­ploy­ment and whether they are con­sis­tent with sim­i­lar cases in the past.</p>
    <p>She said her min­istry re­ceived about 550 com­plaints of il­le­gal de­ploy­ment each year from 2017 to last year. Of these, an av­er­age of 155 em­ploy­ers were warned or fined.</p>
    <p>Of the 155, about 60 were is­sued with an ad­vi­sory no­tice, while 80 were is­sued with a cau­tion.</p>
    <p>On av­er­age, 16 em­ploy­ers re­ceived fines rang­ing from $3,300 to $24,000.</p>
    <p>In de­ter­min­ing the pun­ish­ment for il­le­gal de­ploy­ment, the key con­sid­er­a­tions are the de­gree to which the maid’s well-be­ing has been com­pro­mised and the ex­tent of the il­le­gal de­ploy­ment, Ms Gan said.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti’s case was han­dled in line with these con­sid­er­a­tions, she added. The MOM took no fur­ther ac­tion against Mr Liew, while it is­sued a cau­tion to his wife, Madam Ng Lai Peng, and an ad­vi­sory no­tice to his son, Mr Karl Liew.</p>
    <p>Ms Gan said a re­view into Ms Parti’s case is on­go­ing, and the min­istry will give an up­date when it is com­pleted.</p>
    <p>The high-pro­file case saw MPs file 14 par­lia­men­tary ques­tions on the is­sue.</p>
    <p>They in­clude what went wrong in the in­ves­ti­ga­tions, if the Gov­ern­ment would con­sider al­low­ing for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers to be ac­com­pa­nied by non-le­gal per­son­nel for po­lice in­ter­views, and if di­rect le­gal aid could be pro­vided to vul­ner­a­ble in­di­vid­u­als who are charged with crim­i­nal of­fences.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs Des­mond Tan said the rel­e­vant agen­cies are re­view­ing the mat­ter, and that Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam will de­liver a min­is­te­rial state­ment next month.</p>
    <p>Mr Mu­rali Pil­lai (Bukit Ba­tok) asked about the ex­act scope of the on­go­ing re­view, and whether the in­quiry into the con­duct of the two pros­e­cu­tors in Ms Parti’s case would af­fect Mr Shan­mugam’s abil­ity to de­liver his min­is­te­rial state­ment on the is­sue should it drag on.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Mr Shan­mugam said he would an­swer all the ques­tions raised by MPs on the is­sue in Par­lia­ment next month, adding that the dis­ci­plinary pro­ceed­ings for the two pros­e­cu­tors will be heard and de­cided by the court in “a week or so”.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti, who worked for Mr Liew’s fam­ily for nine years, was sen­tenced to jail in March last year af­ter she was found guilty of steal­ing $34,000 worth of items from the fam­ily. The 46-year-old suc­cess­fully ap­pealed against her con­vic­tion in a three-day hear­ing that took place be­tween Novem­ber last year and Au­gust this year.</p>
    <p>The case sparked an up­roar af­ter a High Court judge found that Ms Parti’s con­vic­tion by the trial judge was “un­safe” for var­i­ous rea­sons. These in­cluded the way the po­lice han­dled the ev­i­dence and the mo­tive be­hind the ac­cu­sa­tions made by some mem­bers of the Liew fam­ily. It led to ques­tions be­ing raised about the crim­i­nal justice sys­tem’s treat­ment of peo­ple who are less well off.</p>
