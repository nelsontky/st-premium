    <p>Malaysia’s Public Works Depart­ment (PWD) is fac­ing on­line back­lash for al­leged dou­ble stan­dard fol­low­ing its re­sponse to a pot­hole ac­ci­dent in­volv­ing a Cabi­net min­is­ter. For many, the PWD’s ac­tion stood in stark con­trast to the depart­ment’s and the lo­cal authoritie­s’ re­sponse to poor road qual­ity.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s Public Works Depart­ment (PWD) is fac­ing on­line back­lash for al­leged dou­ble stan­dard fol­low­ing its re­sponse to a pot­hole ac­ci­dent in­volv­ing a Malaysian Cabi­net min­is­ter on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Hours after Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and In­no­va­tion Min­is­ter Khairy Ja­malud­din shared on Twit­ter how he fell after en­coun­ter­ing an un­even patch of road while rid­ing his bi­cy­cle in Bant­ing, Se­lan­gor, the fed­eral agency apol­o­gised to Mr Khairy on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>The depart­ment also fixed the patch of road within 24 hours of the ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>But the PWD’s ac­tion, for many, stood in stark con­trast to the depart­ment and the lo­cal authoritie­s’ re­sponse to poor road qual­ity, an is­sue that has plagued Malaysians for years.</p>
    <p>Var­i­ous peo­ple started shar­ing or­deals of in­di­vid­u­als who had met with far more se­ri­ous ac­ci­dents due to road de­fects.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post, Parti Sosialis Malaysia leader S. Arutchel­van re­counted how a se­cu­rity guard named Nadara­jan had to fight for his life after a mo­tor­bike ac­ci­dent in 2014 that was caused by a pot­hole in Ka­jang, a ma­jor Klang Val­ley sub­urb. The long re­cov­ery pe­riod after he re­gained con­scious­ness fol­low­ing the crash ul­ti­mately cost him his job.</p>
    <p>Mr Arutchel­van said Mr Nadara­jan did not re­ceive any com­pen­sa­tion from Malaysia’s so­cial se­cu­rity or­gan­i­sa­tion, even after mul­ti­ple ap­peals in­clud­ing one to the Malaysian High Court.</p>
    <p>“Till to­day, no­body apol­o­gised,” Mr Arutchel­van wrote.</p>
    <p>Se­ri­ous ac­ci­dents and deaths due to pot­holes and road de­fects have been re­ported mul­ti­ple times.</p>
    <p>A 2014 study showed that 11.25 per cent of all road deaths in the coun­try were caused by road de­fects. Pot­holes ac­count for about 11 per cent of road de­fect-re­lated ac­ci­dent deaths.</p>
    <p>For the past 11 years, a group of Malaysians, mainly com­pris­ing mo­tor­bike rid­ers, have come to­gether to form Ikatan Sil­lat­u­rahim Broth­er­hood. Mem­bers patch up road de­fects at night at their own ex­pense.</p>
    <p>Many of the group’s founders are rid­ers who have lost friends and fam­ily mem­bers to ac­ci­dents caused by road de­fects left unat­tended by the lo­cal authoritie­s.</p>
    <p>In June, a mem­ber of the Broth­er­hood in Klang, Se­lan­gor, at­tracted at­ten­tion after he placed a tomb­stone in a big pot­hole, in a bid to get the authoritie­s to act. Within 12 hours, the pot­hole was fixed.</p>
    <p>Mr Khairy him­self had asked the PWD not to pay at­ten­tion to the pot­hole is­sue only be­cause the in­ci­dent in­volved a min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>PWD di­rec­tor-gen­eral Mo­hamad Zulke­fly Su­laiman yes­ter­day said that it was tak­ing ne­ti­zens’ com­ments re­gard­ing the depart­ment’s re­spon­sive­ness “se­ri­ously”.</p>
    <p>“Any sugges­tion or crit­i­cism that is con­struc­tive, God will­ing, we will re­ceive them with an open heart,” said Datuk Mo­hamad Zulkelfy, while also list­ing 11 chan­nels that mem­bers of the public can use to reg­is­ter com­plaints with the depart­ment.</p>
    <p>The pot­hole in­ci­dent came days after the govern­ment was crit­i­cised for hav­ing a dou­ble stan­dard when it fined a Klang glove fac­tory RM1,000 (S$330) after a Christ­mas Eve raid by the authoritie­s found that it had bro­ken mul­ti­ple Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Petaling Jaya law­maker Maria Chin Ab­dul­lah called the fine a “slap in the wrist” – point­ing to a case where a 72-year-old woman was jailed for a day and fined RM8,000 for break­ing a home quar­an­tine or­der.</p>
