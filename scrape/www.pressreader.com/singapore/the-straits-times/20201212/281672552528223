    <p>As Sin­ga­pore steps up its ef­forts to com­bat and sur­vive cli­mate change, re­search in the sus­tain­abil­ity space will now fo­cus on re­duc­ing emis­sions from hu­man ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>“De­car­bon­i­sa­tion is one of our new fo­cus ar­eas in RIE2025, and will be a key ad­di­tion to our sus­tain­abil­ity ef­forts,” said Dr Yeoh Lean Weng, se­nior di­rec­tor for ur­ban so­lu­tions and sus­tain­abil­ity at the Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion (NRF).</p>
    <p>Un­der the $25 bil­lion Re­search, In­no­va­tion and En­ter­prise (RIE) 2025 plan an­nounced yes­ter­day, four key ar­eas have been ear­marked, one of which is ur­ban so­lu­tions and sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>The other three are hu­man health and po­ten­tial; man­u­fac­tur­ing, trade and con­nec­tiv­ity; and smart na­tion and the dig­i­tal econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, Sin­ga­pore’s sus­tain­abil­ity re­search ef­forts had fo­cused on ar­eas such as wa­ter se­cu­rity and en­ergy ef­fi­ciency.</p>
    <p>But Dr Yeoh said that un­der the new re­search blue­print, stud­ies would be con­ducted into low­car­bon al­ter­na­tives, such as hy­dro­gen and car­bon cap­ture, util­i­sa­tion and stor­age.</p>
    <p>This will po­si­tion in­dus­tries in Sin­ga­pore to be com­pet­i­tive in a low-car­bon fu­ture, and also sup­port the coun­try’s in­ter­na­tional com­mit­ment to achieve net zero emis­sions as soon as vi­able in the sec­ond half of the cen­tury, he said.</p>
    <p>Other new fo­cus ar­eas in ur­ban so­lu­tions and sus­tain­abil­ity in­clude cli­mate sci­ence, de­vel­op­ing healthy cities, and en­hanc­ing the ef­fi­ciency and pro­duc­tiv­ity of the built en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>World­wide, there is a grow­ing view that the pan­demic and cli­mate change can be tack­led si­mul­ta­ne­ously by re­build­ing economies that are greener and more re­silient, and cre­at­ing new jobs and less de­struc­tive in­dus­tries. Hu­man ac­tiv­i­ties such as the burn­ing of fos­sil fu­els are con­tribut­ing to cli­mate change by re­leas­ing heat-trap­ping emis­sions into the at­mos­phere.</p>
    <p>Some coun­tries have re­sponded by rolling out green stim­u­lus plans that in­clude re­search into clean en­ergy so­lu­tions. Ger­many, for in­stance, com­mit­ted €130 bil­lion (S$211 bil­lion) to pan­demic re­cov­ery, with about 30 per cent to be spent on ac­tiv­i­ties that will cut emis­sions, Bloomberg re­ported.</p>
    <p>But the NRF said in re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times that many coun­tries’ green re­cov­ery plans in­clude funds for cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­ture in the use of green tech­nolo­gies, such as build­ing en­ergy ef­fi­ciency measures, pub­lic trans­port in­fra­struc­ture or sub­si­dies for the de­ploy­ment of so­lar pho­to­voltaic sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Th­ese go be­yond re­search and devel­op­ment, and so should not be di­rectly com­pared with the RIE bud­get, said the NRF spokesman.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu said dur­ing yes­ter­day’s vir­tual press con­fer­ence that it was cru­cial for Sin­ga­pore to fo­cus on the press­ing is­sues of cli­mate change, de­car­bon­i­sa­tion, healthy cities and the built en­vi­ron­ment now.</p>
    <p>“Some may re­quire long-term R&D in­vest­ment and ef­fort be­fore we can reap tan­gi­ble out­comes,” she said.</p>
    <p>But she noted that re­search can­not oc­cur in a vac­uum. “To tackle such com­plex, cross-cut­ting chal­lenges, we must also look for so­lu­tions be­yond the nat­u­ral sciences and en­gi­neer­ing,” she added. “We will tap other dis­ci­plines, such as so­cial and be­havioural sciences, since in­flu­enc­ing hu­man be­hav­iour is key to cre­at­ing real change.”</p>
