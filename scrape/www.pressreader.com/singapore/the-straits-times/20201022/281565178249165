    <p>While many small and medium-sized en­ter­prises in Sin­ga­pore have strate­gies in place to go dig­i­tal, the take-up rate has been slow, with firms blam­ing Covid-19 for caus­ing de­lays in their dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion plans. This is in stark con­trast to the be­lief that the out­break has fast-tracked dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion for many com­pa­nies, a study showed.</p>
    <p>While many small and medi­um­sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) here have strate­gies in place to go dig­i­tal, the take-up rate has been slow with firms blam­ing Covid-19 for caus­ing de­lays in their dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion plans.</p>
    <p>This is in stark con­trast to the be­lief that the out­break has fast­tracked dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion for many com­pa­nies, a study by the As­so­ci­a­tion of Small and Medium En­ter­prises (ASME) and tech gi­ant Mi­crosoft showed.</p>
    <p>The SME Dig­i­tal Trans­for­ma­tion Study in­volved a poll of 400 SME own­ers and key IT de­ci­sion-mak­ers here from March to June.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey found that 83 per cent of SMEs in Sin­ga­pore have dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion strate­gies in place, but de­spite higher adop­tion rates, only two in five SMEs per­ceived their ef­forts to be suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>More than half the firms (54 per cent) blamed the Covid-19 out­break for slow­ing their dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion plans, but about an equal pro­por­tion (56 per cent) said it was too ex­pen­sive to dig­i­talise.</p>
    <p>They also cited a lack of dig­i­tal skills and low aware­ness of dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion ini­tia­tives by the Gov­ern­ment which they could tap.</p>
    <p>Mr Vivek Cha­trath, small, medium and cor­po­rate lead for Mi­crosoft Sin­ga­pore, noted that due to their size and struc­ture, SMEs have unique needs and some may lack the re­sources to dig­i­tally trans­form.</p>
    <p>He said that dis­rup­tions from Covid-19 had hit these firms hard, and some have to re­fo­cus their ef­forts to just stay afloat.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing Sin­ga­pore’s cir­cuit breaker and the months that fol­lowed, many small busi­nesses took hits to their rev­enue as a re­sult of forced clo­sures or re­duced op­er­at­ing ca­pac­i­ties,” said Mr Cha­trath.</p>
    <p>“These SMEs have had to de­pri­ori­tise in­vest­ments in dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion as they fo­cused on en­sur­ing busi­ness sur­vival and over­com­ing fi­nan­cial chal­lenges.”</p>
    <p>A sim­i­lar sur­vey was car­ried out in 2018.</p>
    <p>The take-up rate was lower then, with 57 per cent of firms in­di­cat­ing they were aware of dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion. Only 56 per cent had dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion strate­gies in place.</p>
    <p>In the lat­est it­er­a­tion, the re­spon­dents were from 15 in­dus­tries, rep­re­sent­ing pro­fes­sional and busi­ness ser­vices, man­u­fac­tur­ing, health­care, con­struc­tion and en­ergy.</p>
    <p>The study found that top bar­ri­ers to dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion in­cluded the un­cer­tain eco­nomic en­vi­ron­ment, a low aware­ness of gov­ern­ment sup­port and the lack of a dig­i­tally skilled work­force.</p>
    <p>The big­gest com­plaint was the high cost in­volved.</p>
    <p>Ms Irene Boey, vice-pres­i­dent of mem­ber­ship and train­ing for ASME, said a rea­son for firms fail­ing in their dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion plans is due to the in­ap­pro­pri­ate choice of tech­nol­ogy used.</p>
    <p>She said while SMEs im­ple</p>
    <p>ACHIEV­ING DE­SIRED OUT­COMES</p>
    <p>SMEs need to adopt an out­come-driven mind­set when it comes to dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion – where they need to be clear of their busi­ness ob­jec­tives and needs be­fore iden­ti­fy­ing suitable types of dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies that can help achieve their de­sired out­comes.</p>
    <p>VICE-PRES­I­DENT OF MEM­BER­SHIP AND TRAIN­ING FOR ASME IRENE BOEY</p>
    <p>mented dig­i­tal so­lu­tions that have been ap­proved by gov­ern­ment grants, they failed to con­sider if such so­lu­tions are the best to meet their needs.</p>
    <p>“What we want to em­pha­sise is that SMEs need to adopt an out­come-driven mind­set when it comes to dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion – where they need to be clear of their busi­ness ob­jec­tives and needs be­fore iden­ti­fy­ing suitable types of dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies that can help achieve their de­sired out­comes,” said Ms Boey.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey found that the top three dig­i­tal so­lu­tions firms are keen on adopt­ing are: ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and ma­chine learn­ing, busi­ness process apps, as well as big data and ad­vanced an­a­lyt­ics.</p>
    <p>Sun­light Pa­per, a tis­sue prod­uct sup­plier first es­tab­lished in 1977, re­cently im­ple­mented a new fleet man­age­ment sys­tem that uses cloud-based tech­nol­ogy to al­low com­pany of­fi­cers to ac­cess both cus­tomer and prod­uct data eas­ily.</p>
    <p>This al­lows the com­pany to au­to­mate pro­cesses and re­duce time spent on pa­per­work.</p>
    <p>Mr Marc Chua, the firm’s busi­ness de­vel­op­ment man­ager, said that it im­proved the com­pany’s pro­duc­tiv­ity by 400 per cent.</p>
    <p>“We strongly em­brace the ben­e­fits that dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion can bring to our day-to-day op­er­a­tions – whether by op­ti­mis­ing pro­cesses or im­prov­ing em­ployee and cus­tomer en­gage­ment,” he said.</p>
