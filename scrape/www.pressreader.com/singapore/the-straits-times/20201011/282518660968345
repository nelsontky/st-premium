    <p>If you miss Tai­wanese street food, here is a pop­u­lar snack you can whip up at home.</p>
    <p>Fried ice cream is not a new thing, but the Tai­wanese ver­sion of it – called zha bing qi lin in Man­darin, es­sen­tially a deep-fried ice cream sand­wich – seems the eas­i­est to repli­cate. Or at least that is what sev­eral recipe videos I checked out on­line will have me be­lieve.</p>
    <p>It is an at­trac­tive dish con­sid­er­ing how short the in­gre­di­ent list is. But I do not have an air-con­di­tioned kitchen and our tropical weather makes the dish quite a chal­lenge to pull off.</p>
    <p>But hav­ing a spring-han­dle ice cream scoop of the right size helps a lot. It takes me two at­tempts to fig­ure out a suit­able size – the scoop should be 4.6cm in di­am­e­ter. If too big a scoop of ice cream is placed on the stan­dard white bread slices, it will leak.</p>
    <p>I try us­ing spoons of vary­ing sizes, but it is dif­fi­cult to get a per­fect half-scoop of ice cream needed for this recipe.</p>
    <p>Do not at­tempt to weigh your ice cream, be­cause it will melt be­fore you can shape your sand­wich. In­stead, fill the ice cream scoop to the brim, which works out to half a scoop of ice cream. If you do not mind spend­ing a tad more, get an Ital­ian-made spring-han­dle scoop. The spring han­dle for the one I bought works smoothly.</p>
    <p>For the white bread, I rec­om­mend Gar­de­nia En­riched White Bread (also low in sugar) or FairPrice White Bread – En­riched, be­cause I find that the slices have fewer holes and can bet­ter hold in the ice cream fill­ing.</p>
    <p>Re­move the bread crust so you can flat­ten the bread evenly with a rolling pin. (Tip: Keep the crust to make bread crust fries or turn them into crumbs for coat­ing other food for fry­ing).</p>
    <p>Us­ing a flour mix­ture to brush the fill­ing side of the bread helps the ice cream stick and seal the edges of the re­sult­ing disc-shaped ice cream sand­wich.</p>
    <p>Use a drink­ing glass with a 7cm di­am­e­ter as a mould for form­ing the disc shape. While you can also use a bowl or cup, a glass al­lows you to see if the bread can hold in the fill­ing as you are shap­ing it.</p>
    <p>Use a knife to re­move the ex­cess bread. Do not try to shake out the sand­wich from the glass. Care­fully pick at the edge and gen­tly ease it out.</p>
    <p>Place the sand­wich on a bak­ing tray and freeze it im­me­di­ately while you pre­pare the rest of the sand­wiches. It is im­por­tant that you work quickly as the ice cream melts rapidly in our hot weather. If the ice cream can­not hold its shape, it is best to put it back in the freezer and let it get solid enough.</p>
    <p>While some on­line recipes call for the sand­wiches to be frozen for 30 min­utes to an hour be­fore deep-fry­ing, I think it is best to do so for at least four hours or overnight.</p>
    <p>Each sand­wich should go straight from the freezer into the hot oil. Do not thaw or the ice cream fill­ing might lose its shape dur­ing the flash-fry­ing.</p>
    <p>You also want to avoid con­den­sa­tion as wa­ter droplets on the sand­wich will cause the oil to splat­ter.</p>
    <p>This is not a dish to daw­dle over and it is best eaten stove-side.</p>
