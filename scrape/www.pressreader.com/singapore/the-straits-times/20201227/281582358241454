    <p>The cur­rent largest clus­ter is at a prison in east­ern Seoul, where 514 in­mates and work­ers have been in­fected, prompt­ing the health au­thor­i­ties to test all peo­ple there.</p>
    <p>SEOUL • South Korea posted its sec­ond-high­est daily num­ber of coro­n­avirus cases yesterday as out­breaks at a prison, nurs­ing homes and churches con­tin­ued to grow, prompt­ing the au­thor­i­ties to plead for a halt to all year-end gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>The Korea Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion Agency (KDCA) said there were 1,132 new coro­n­avirus cases on Fri­day, not too far off the record of 1,241 logged a day ear­lier.</p>
    <p>“The virus is spread­ing when­ever and wher­ever it wants,” Health Min­is­ter Kwon Deok-cheol told an in­tra-agency meet­ing, adding that peo­ple were also be­ing in­fected at small gath­er­ings with friends and ac­quain­tances.</p>
    <p>“As we stand at the cross­roads of the third wave, how we stop the spread hinges on how we spend this year-end and New Year pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>The govern­ment plans to hold a meet­ing to­day to dis­cuss whether it will tighten dis­tanc­ing rules to the tough­est level for the Greater Seoul area.</p>
    <p>That would shut an­other 1.2 mil­lion stores and al­low only es­sen­tial work­ers into of­fices.</p>
    <p>Curbs cur­rently in place have closed night­clubs, karaoke bars</p>
    <p>and other night entertainm­ent venues as well as banned on-site din­ing af­ter 9pm.</p>
    <p>Ahead of the Christ­mas and New Year hol­i­days, the govern­ment also banned gath­er­ings of more than four peo­ple in the Greater Seoul area and closed down ski re</p>
    <p>sorts and other tourist spots.</p>
    <p>South Korea had largely man­aged to con­trol early ma­jor out­breaks with ag­gres­sive test­ing and con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>But crit­ics have faulted the au­thor­i­ties for be­ing over­con­fi­dent and fail­ing to prop­erly pre­pare for</p>
    <p>the third and largest wave.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent largest clus­ter is at a prison in east­ern Seoul, where 514 in­mates and work­ers have been in­fected, prompt­ing the health au­thor­i­ties to test all peo­ple there.</p>
    <p>The virus likely spread eas­ily as the prison con­sists of five high-rise</p>
    <p>build­ings and suf­fers from over­ca­pac­ity, a health of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s to­tal in­fec­tions now stand at 55,902, with 793 deaths, KDCA data showed.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, Yon­hap news agency re­ported on Fri­day that South Korea had re­ceived its first ship­ment of the coro­n­avirus vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The vac­cines, from United States biotech com­pany Moderna, are for Amer­i­can troops, and air­port au­thor­i­ties said that a cargo plane of US de­liv­ery com­pany FedEx car­ry­ing the vac­cine landed at In­cheon In­ter­na­tional Air­port from Mem­phis, Tennessee, at 12.54pm.</p>
    <p>The ship­ment, re­ported as 1,000 doses of the vac­cine, was trans­ported to All­good Army Com­mu­nity Hos­pi­tal in­side Camp Humphreys, the US mil­i­tary head­quar­ters lo­cated about 70km south of Seoul.</p>
    <p>Gen­eral Robert Abrams, com­man­der of US Forces Korea, said last Wed­nes­day that his com­mand will be­gin to re­ceive and ad­min­is­ter the Moderna vac­cine “over the next few days”, and the ini­tial in­oc­u­la­tions will go to front-line health­care work­ers and first re­spon­ders.</p>
    <p>The US De­part­ment of De­fence said ear­lier that All­good Army Com­mu­nity Hos­pi­tal will be one of four sites out­side the con­ti­nen­tal US that will re­ceive the ini­tial vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The US sta­tions some 28,000 troops in South Korea to de­ter North Korean ag­gres­sion, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War that ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.</p>
