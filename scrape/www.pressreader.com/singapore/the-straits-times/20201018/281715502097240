    <p>The beaches of Sen­tosa were sig­nif­i­cantly less crowded than usual yes­ter­day, the first day beach­go­ers were re­quired to pre-book slots for week­ends and pub­lic hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>Groups of not more than five peo­ple were spread out across Tan­jong, Palawan and Siloso beaches, with am­ple dis­tance be­tween each group, likely due to no-shows from some reser­va­tion hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors who turned up without on­line book­ings were ei­ther turned away or given a later avail­able time slot, with wait­ing time vary­ing from five min­utes to al­most two hours across the dif­fer­ent en­try check­points.</p>
    <p>Civil ser­vant Ang Wei Le, 28, and her friend, who turned up at Palawan Beach around 2.30pm without a book­ing, were given the next avail­able slot at 4pm.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Sun­day Times as they were pass­ing time at a nearby bench with their take­away food laid out on it, Ms Ang said: “We didn’t re­alise the book­ing sys­tem started to­day, so it’s a bit sian (Hokkien for an­noy­ing) that we have to wait for our slot, but it’s bet­ter than mak­ing a wasted trip.</p>
    <p>“We were plan­ning to have our meal on the beach but we’re starv­ing, so we de­cided to eat here.”</p>
    <p>Over at Tan­jong Beach, Mr Zac Wong and his wife had to wait only five min­utes to en­ter the beach, even though they did not make a prior book­ing.</p>
    <p>The new­ly­wed cou­ple were on a stay­ca­tion at a nearby ho­tel.</p>
    <p>“We’re quite lucky that there was a slot for us on the spot, but even if there wasn’t one, we would have been okay be­cause we will just go back to the ho­tel.</p>
    <p>“We do feel safer with this mea­sure and will come back again next time,” said the 29-year-old, who works in the tech in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Other safe man­age­ment mea­sures that were in place at the beaches in­cluded “safety rings” which de­mar­cate spots where groups of up to five may gather.</p>
    <p>Safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors were seen pa­trolling the beaches and at the nearby food and bev­er­age out­lets.</p>
    <p>Most of the 15 beach courts across the three beaches – Tan­jong, Palawan and Siloso – which re­quire pre-book­ings were oc­cu­pied.</p>
    <p>Beach­front F&B out­lets and at­trac­tions, which were not sub­jected to the on­line book­ing re­quire­ment, ap­peared to be qui­eter than usual.</p>
    <p>Ms Novem Tz, 33, a barista at Baris­tart Cof­fee along Siloso Beach, said yes­ter­day’s foot­fall had fallen by half com­pared with the pre­vi­ous week.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar sen­ti­ments were ex­pressed by the man­ager of Ola Beach Club, who said the weekend was shap­ing up to be one of the qui­etest since the beach club re­opened in phase two.</p>
    <p>The man­ager, who de­clined to be named, is hope­ful that busi­ness will pick up as beach­go­ers who do not make an ad­vance on­line book­ing may de­cide to pa­tro­n­ise Ola Beach Club in­stead.</p>
    <p>“Ola is di­rectly on the beach too, so peo­ple who can­not go onto the main beach can come here,” he said.</p>
    <p>Slots for on­line book­ing are sub­ject to ca­pac­ity lim­its. Book­ings can be made at this web­site – https://www.sen­tosa.com.sg/ beachreser­va­tions</p>
    <p>Guests may choose from two time slots: morn­ing (8am to 1pm), or af­ter­noon (2 to 7pm), for up to</p>
    <p>five peo­ple per book­ing.</p>
    <p>On the day of the visit, guests should ap­proach the beach en­try kiosk of their selected zone and present their con­fir­ma­tion e-mail for ver­i­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>They will then be is­sued wrist­bands for ad­mis­sion and may ac­cess the selected beach zone at any point dur­ing the re­served time slot.</p>
    <p>Last month, Sen­tosa De­vel­op­ment Cor­po­ra­tion said it would trial the book­ing sys­tem for an ini­tial pe­riod of three months for the three beaches.</p>
    <p>The three beaches have been seg­mented into a to­tal of seven zones, each with a ca­pac­ity limit rang­ing be­tween 100 and 350 to al­low for safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>The zones also have spe­cific en­try and exit points, where vis­i­tors are re­quired to check in and check out us­ing the SafeEn­try dig­i­tal sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Cabin crew mem­ber Melvin Ho, 38, and his fam­ily of four, in­clud­ing two chil­dren, said while the book­ing sys­tem is “def­i­nitely more trou­ble­some”, he feels that it is much more “ef­fi­cient and safer”.</p>

The out&#xAD;door dis&#xAD;play of more than 20 di&#xAD;nosaur mod&#xAD;els has been draw&#xAD;ing crowds since it opened last week. Vis&#xAD;i&#xAD;tors must now re&#xAD;serve a slot on Changi PlayPass to visit on Fri&#xAD;days, Satur&#xAD;days and Sun&#xAD;days till Jan 3.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Beach&#xAD;go&#xAD;ers yes&#xAD;ter&#xAD;day at Palawan Beach on Sen&#xAD;tosa had plenty of space to them&#xAD;selves, with the roll-out of an on&#xAD;line book&#xAD;ing sys&#xAD;tem for visits dur&#xAD;ing week&#xAD;ends and pub&#xAD;lic hol&#xAD;i&#xAD;days. But the lower turnout at Sen&#xAD;tosa&#x2019;s three beaches af&#xAD;fected the tak&#xAD;ings of beach&#xAD;front F&amp;B out&#xAD;lets and at&#xAD;trac&#xAD;tions.</p>
