        World | The Sunday Times Sunday, August 23, 2020 | A14 PAS now an official member of Muhyiddin’s PN alliance • Malaysia’s Islamist party PAS has formally joined Perikatan Nasional (PN), making it only the second official member of the ruling alliance after Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin’s own political organisati­on, according to a source.
The PN alliance was registered with the Registrar of Societies under the name Parti Perikatan Nasional two weeks ago and has a logo which will be used by the component parties and PNfriendly parties in the next general election, The Star online news reported yesterday.
The entry of Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) as an official PN member is an important milestone for Tan Sri Muhyiddin’s Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia as he tries to solidify the loose PN alliance.
PN came to power just five months ago as several blocs of lawmakers who were formerly political enemies joined up to topple the Pakatan Harapan administra­tion.
“There is an agreed pro-tem committee which will make the decisions for Perikatan on behalf of Bersatu and PAS,” the source told The Star.
PN altogether has control of just half of the 222 seats in Parliament, the weakest ruling alliance since the country’s independen­ce.
The move to turn PN into a formal coalition – through the registrati­on – is a move to ensure the loyalty of its allies.
But Umno, the biggest party in PN with 38 federal lawmakers, has said it would not become an official member of PN, although it will support its policies.
Umno has further said it prefers to strengthen instead a separate faction called Muafakat Nasional with PAS. Bersatu has only j ust been accepted as Muafakat’s third member, i n Malaysia’s ever-shifting political alliances.
Gabungan Parti Sarawak, with 13 MPs, has also said it is staying out of PN but is supportive of its policies.
The pro-tem committee of PN for now comprises PAS’ deputy president Ahmad Samsuri Mokhtar and secretary-general Takiyuddin Hassan.
Bersatu is represente­d by its secretary-general Hamzah Zainuddin and PN government Whip Azmin Ali. PETALING JAYA KL minister apologises for flouting quarantine, donates salary Health Ministry pink wristband like all other returnees – to indicate he is a “person under investigat­ion” by the ministry – and then placed under quarantine until July 20.
The minister instead said he had taken the Covid-19 test three times and that all had shown he was clear of the virus. He said he took the tests upon returning from Turkey on July 7, another one 13 days later as mandated, and recently prior to attending an event at the palace.
But Malaysians on social media and opposition politician­s continued to criticise him. • A Malaysian Cabinet minister, who caused a public uproar for failing to follow the government’s mandatory quarantine order after returning from abroad, apologised yesterday.
Plantation Industries and Commoditie­s Minister Mohd Khairuddin Aman Razali said he will also donate four months of his salary to the government’s Covid-19 fund.
He was earlier slapped with a fine of RM1,000 (S$328) by the Health Ministry for flouting the quarantine order. He has paid the fine.
“Referring to the Health Ministry’s press statement on the issue of the recovery movement control order (MCO) standard operating procedures (SOPs) today, I apologise to all Malaysians for the mistake that has occurred. As a minister, I have a responsibi­lity to follow all the regulation­s and SOPs throughout the recovery MCO,” Datuk Mohd Khairuddin said in a statement.
“To show that sense of responsibi­lity, I will be returning all of my salary as a minister from May until August 2020 as a contributi­on to the national Covid-19 fund under the Health Ministry. My salary for March and April 2020 was also contribute­d towards the fund, as per the Cabinet’s previous decision,” he added. In March, the Cabinet decided that all of its members’ salaries would be deducted for the next two months and contribute­d to the Covid-19 fund.
Mr Khairuddin returned from Turkey on July 7, but instead of being quarantine­d for the mandatory 14 days for returnees from abroad, he was seen on his social media postings meeting people and attending functions with other ministers.
This raised public anger as other Malaysians had been fined, and even jailed, for not heeding the mandatory quarantine order as a precaution against spreading the coronaviru­s.
Mr Khairuddin had for days remained defiant despite being exposed on social media.
