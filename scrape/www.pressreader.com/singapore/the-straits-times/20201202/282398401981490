    <p>LON­DON • Marine, who are sub­merged in the eighth tier of English foot­ball, are clear un­der­dogs af­ter they were handed a game at home to Premier League lead­ers Tot­ten­ham in Mon­day’s draw for the FA Cup third round.</p>
    <p>The team are, nev­er­the­less, rel­ish­ing the op­por­tu­nity to rise to the oc­ca­sion next month.</p>
    <p>Top-flight sides en­ter the com­pe­ti­tion in the third round (64 teams) and Spurs were given a tie sure to cap­ture the at­ten­tion of foot­ball ro­man­tics.</p>
    <p>North­ern Premier League Di­vi­sion One side Marine be­came only the se­cond club from the eighth tier to reach the third round af­ter beat­ing Ha­vant and Water­looville af­ter ex­tra time on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Their re­ward is a visit from Jose Mour­inho’s men, who last won the FA Cup in 1991 and have not lifted a ma­jor tro­phy since the 2008 League Cup.</p>
    <p>Marine boss Neil Young told the BBC: “It’s an un­be­liev­able draw. We will plan as best we can.</p>
    <p>“Usu­ally with Jose’s teams, he puts pretty strong sides out. We have won seven games to get here and this is a great re­ward.”</p>
    <p>Marine cap­tain Niall Cum­mins, a fan of Tot­ten­ham’s north Lon­don ri­vals Ar­se­nal and a phys­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion teacher, added: “I don’t know where to be­gin. I think we’re of­fi­cially the low­es­tranked team left in it and, judg­ing by the Premier League ta­ble at the mo­ment, they’re the hard­est team we could have pos­si­bly got.</p>
    <p>“It’s ab­so­lutely un­be­liev­able. I checked my phone a se­cond af­ter the draw and it’s gone off like mad.”</p>
    <p>Sixth-tier side Chor­ley will play Wayne Rooney’s Derby at home, while fifth-tier Stock­port have also been handed home ad­van­tage against West Ham.</p>
    <p>FA Cup hold­ers Ar­se­nal face New­cas­tle at the Emi­rates Sta­dium and an­other all-Premier League tie sees As­ton Villa against Liver­pool at Villa Park.</p>
    <p>League Two side Craw­ley have been drawn to play Leeds at home and League One team Bris­tol Rovers have been re­warded for thrash­ing sixth-tier Dar­ling­ton 6-0 in the se­cond round with a home tie against Sh­effield United.</p>
    <p>Last sea­son’s beaten fi­nal­ists Chelsea will play League Two side More­cambe at Stam­ford Bridge.</p>
    <p>Manch­ester City, the win­ners last year, will host Birm­ing­ham, while Manch­ester United face Wat­ford at Old Traf­ford.</p>
