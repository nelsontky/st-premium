    <p>YANGON • The makeshift bar­ri­ers are as­sem­bled from wooden planks, pieces of bam­boo or metal pipes.</p>
    <p>Signs on them warn that “one will be charged un­der lo­cal law if one breaks the rules” and “only res­i­dents’ ve­hi­cles (are) al­lowed to en­ter”.</p>
    <p>They are guarded round the clock by vol­un­teers or se­cu­rity staff hired by Yangon res­i­dents, who took mat­ters into their own hands amid Myan­mar’s es­ca­lat­ing Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>“I can­not say for sure how ef­fec­tive this will be,” said Mr Kyaw Swar, a res­i­dent guard­ing his neigh­bour­hood in Min­galar Taung Nyunt town­ship on Mon­day. “But at least this can make peo­ple stay home dur­ing this stay-home pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>Myan­mar has seen a wor­ry­ing spike of well over 200 coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions daily and has logged 3,821 in­fec­tions as of 8pm yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>At least 15 pa­tients have died since Mon­day morn­ing, with a to­tal tally of 40 deaths so far.</p>
    <p>Al­though this sec­ond Covid-19 wave orig­i­nated in Rakhine state last month, most new in­fec­tions are now sur­fac­ing in Yangon, Myan­mar’s com­mer­cial cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>Neigh­bour­ing China and Thai­land have tight­ened re­stric­tions at their bor­ders to avoid im­ported in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Most of Yangon’s ur­ban town­ships have been put un­der stay­home or­ders, with res­i­dents al­lowed to leave their homes only to work, buy gro­ceries or seek med­i­cal help. Do­mes­tic travel is banned.</p>
    <p>Cam­paign­ing for Myan­mar’s Nov 8 gen­eral elec­tion kicked off last week, but the mil­i­tary-aligned Union Sol­i­dar­ity and Devel­op­ment Party and other smaller par­ties</p>
    <p>have ap­pealed for the polls to be post­poned.</p>
    <p>Yet the rul­ing Na­tional League for Democ­racy, which is widely ex­pected to win, warned that an elec­tion de­lay would heap po­lit­i­cal dif­fi­cul­ties on top of the health and eco­nomic cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Dr Khin Khin Gyi, di­rec­tor of the con­ta­gious dis­ease pre­ven­tion and erad­i­ca­tion di­vi­sion at the Health and Sports Min­istry, told The Straits Times: “Con­di­tions in Yangon are very risky. Within 12 days, 20 peo­ple died. We have to be very cau­tious.”</p>
    <p>Myan­mar’s main Covid-19 treat­ment cen­tres are al­most full.</p>
    <p>Over 4,000 peo­ple are be­ing tested daily, the max­i­mum test­ing ca­pac­ity at present, said Dr Khin Khin Gyi. Tem­po­rary hos­pi­tals are be­ing erected on sports grounds and an ex­ist­ing hous­ing com­plex.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, the bar­ri­ers erected by Yangon’s res­i­dents are turn­ing the city’s grid-like pub­lic streets into a maze of dead ends.</p>
    <p>Some res­i­dents stop all out­siders, in­clud­ing street ven­dors, from en­ter­ing their wards.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion is par­tic­u­larly chal</p>
    <p>leng­ing to food de­liv­ery cy­clist Aung Ko Ko.</p>
    <p>“When they don’t al­low me to en­ter the street, I have to find some other route to reach the des­ti­na­tion. It is very dif­fi­cult for me be­cause I earn only 600 or 700 ky­ats (60 to 70 Sin­ga­pore cents),” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Taxi driver Zin Min has had to dou­ble his ask­ing price for trips be­cause short cuts through back­streets are now dif­fi­cult to take.</p>
    <p>“Some pas­sen­gers un­der­stand the sit­u­a­tion and they get off at the front gate,” he said. “Some in­sist that I en­ter the street and I have to ar­gue with the guards for so long.”</p>
    <p>The Asian Devel­op­ment Bank ex­pects Myan­mar’s econ­omy to grow just 1.8 per cent for the fis­cal year end­ing Sept 30, but bounce back to 6 per cent in the sub­se­quent year.</p>
    <p>But it warned that fu­ture in­vest­ment flows could be af­fected should the global econ­omy stay de­pressed.</p>
    <p>RISKY CON­DI­TIONS</p>
    <p>Con­di­tions in Yangon are very risky. Within 12 days, 20 peo­ple died. We have to be very cau­tious.</p>
    <p>DR KHIN KHIN GYI, of Myan­mar’s Health and Sports Min­istry</p>
