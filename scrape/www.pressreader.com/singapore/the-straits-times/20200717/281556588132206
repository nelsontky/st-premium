    <p>In re­sponse to the grow­ing China threat, Can­berra has made a rad­i­cal shift in its de­fence strat­egy. It is look­ing to long-range deter­rent strikes and build­ing a re­gional coali­tion to shield Aus­tralia from Bei­jing’s grow­ing mil­i­tary power. But ques­tions re­main as to how it will meet its new goals, says Emer­i­tus Pro­fes­sor Hugh White.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia is se­ri­ously wor­ried about its de­fence. This is clear from Can­berra’s new de­fence pol­icy re­view, re­leased ear­lier this month. But it is not clear what it plans to do about it. The De­fence Strate­gic Up­date 2020 car­ries a lot of mes­sages, not all of them cred­i­ble or mu­tu­ally con­sis­tent. How­ever, the im­pli­ca­tions for Aus­tralia’s neigh­bours in Asia are plain.</p>
    <p>Can­berra wants to ex­pand de­fence re­la­tions with other re­gional coun­tries, with the aim of cre­at­ing a re­gional coali­tion di­rected against China. It wants to rely on this coali­tion to shield Aus­tralia from Bei­jing’s grow­ing mil­i­tary power. But it has no con­crete diplo­matic ideas about how to build such a coali­tion, and is do­ing lit­tle to ex­pand its own mil­i­tary ca­pac­ity to con­trib­ute to re­gional se­cu­rity. This does not bode well for Aus­tralia’s fu­ture strate­gic role in Asia.</p>
    <p>The big head­line from the gov­ern­ment’s an­nounce­ment was its stark iden­ti­fi­ca­tion of China as Aus­tralia’s pri­mary po­ten­tial threat. Af­ter tip­toe­ing for years around the strate­gic am­bi­tions of its big­gest trad­ing part­ner, Can­berra has now jumped in with both feet.</p>
    <p>The de­fence up­date high­lights China’s es­ca­lat­ing ri­valry with the US, its “ac­tive pur­suit of greater in­flu­ence in the Indo-Pa­cific” and its es­tab­lish­ment of mil­i­tary bases, which could “un­der­mine sta­bil­ity in the Indo-Pa­cific”. The doc­u­ment also sug­gests that Can­berra is los­ing faith in Wash­ing­ton’s abil­ity and will­ing­ness to meet Bei­jing’s chal­lenge. As a re­sult, it im­plies, the risk of high-in­ten­sity con­flict within the next 10 years had in­creased markedly.</p>
    <p>This tough talk on China is in line with a pat­tern of ris­ing ac­ri­mony be­tween Can­berra and Bei­jing, go­ing back to 2017 and es­ca­lat­ing sharply in the past few months.</p>
    <p>There have been plenty of provo­ca­tions from Bei­jing, but Prime Min­is­ter Scott Morrison has seemed at times over-ea­ger to present him­self as a doughty de­fender of Aus­tralian in­ter­ests and val­ues against an over­ween­ing China. It seems to play well for him po­lit­i­cally, de­spite the omi­nous im­pli­ca­tions for Aus­tralia’s coro­n­avirus-rav­aged econ­omy of ruc­tions with its big­gest trad­ing part­ner.</p>
    <p>But it raises ma­jor ques­tions about how Aus­tralia deals with a hos­tile China in the years ahead.</p>
    <p>LONG-RANGE DETER­RENT STRIKES</p>
    <p>The de­fence up­date of­fers big ideas about how to do this. First, it sketches a new mil­i­tary strat­egy to deal with the ris­ing threats, fo­cused on de­ter­rence. It says the old strat­egy – which has been in place since the 1970s and fo­cused on pre­vent­ing hos­tile forces ap­proach­ing Aus­tralia’s shores – was too de­fen­sive.</p>
    <p>It pro­poses in­stead a more ag­gres­sive strat­egy of long-range deter­rent strikes. In fu­ture, Aus­tralia’s forces “must be able to hold po­ten­tial ad­ver­saries’ forces and in­fra­struc­ture at risk from a greater dis­tance”, it states, to “in­flu­ence their cal­cu­lus of costs in­volved in threat­en­ing Aus­tralian in­ter­ests”.</p>
    <p>But it does not ex­plain how Aus­tralia could cred­i­bly threaten large-scale at­tacks on a coun­try as big, and as dis­tant, as China. That would re­quire a ma­jor in­vest­ment in long-range strikes. But there seem to be no con­crete plans to ac­quire the kind of mis­siles or air­craft that could do this.</p>
    <p>Nor does it ex­plain how Can­berra could counter the prospect of dev­as­tat­ing Chi­nese counter-at­tacks, which would eas­ily neu­tralise Aus­tralian deter­rent threats. In­deed, it is hard to see how a strat­egy of de­ter­rence makes sense against an ad­ver­sary as pow­er­ful as China which can hit Aus­tralia so much harder than it can hit back.</p>
    <p>SHIFT IN GE­O­GRAPHIC FO­CUS</p>
    <p>The sec­ond big idea floated in the up­date is to em­brace the re­gion even more strongly that it has done in the past.</p>
    <p>This is re­flected in the ma­jor shift which it pro­poses in the ge­o­graph­i­cal fo­cus of Aus­tralia’s de­fence ef­fort. It gives pri­mary em­pha­sis to co­op­er­at­ing with re­gional neigh­bours to de­fend its wider in­ter­ests through­out what it calls Aus­tralia’s “im­me­di­ate re­gion”, ex­tend­ing to the whole of mainland and mar­itime South-east Asia as well as the South-west Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>It there­fore moves away from the pol­icy of self-re­liance which has been at the heart of Aus­tralian de­fence pol­icy for decades. Un­der that pol­icy, most im­por­tance was given to forces to de­fend Aus­tralia it­self with­out re­ly­ing on al­lies, while forces to sup­port al­lies and coali­tions fur­ther afield had a lower pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>Now that seems to have been qui­etly shelved, as the up­date gives re­gional part­ner­ships equal pri­or­ity with de­fend­ing Aus­tralia it­self. In­deed, read­ing be­tween the lines, it seems that Can­berra plans to in­creas­ingly rely on its neigh­bours, rather than on it­self, to keep Aus­tralia se­cure.</p>
    <p>Of course it makes per­fect sense for Aus­tralia to max­imise co­op­er­a­tion with its re­gional neigh­bours as strate­gic ten­sions in Asia rise.</p>
    <p>WILL THE NEIGH­BOURS AGREE?</p>
    <p>But there are two big ques­tions about how Can­berra can give sub­stance to this new em­pha­sis. One con­cerns how closely Aus­tralia’s in­ter­ests and ob­jec­tives – es­pe­cially in re­la­tion to China – re­ally mesh with those of its Asian neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>The up­date con­fi­dently as­sumes that the coun­tries in what it calls Aus­tralia’s im­me­di­ate re­gion all share the same val­ues and hold a com­mon vi­sion of a fu­ture sta­ble re­gional or­der.</p>
    <p>But that can­not be taken for granted. On the con­trary, Mr Morrison’s overtly provoca­tive stance to­wards China is out of step with the more cir­cum­spect tone taken by many of Aus­tralia’s neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>More­over, the re­gion re­mains deeply com­mit­ted to the pre­cepts on which Asean has been built over many decades, which do not favour the de­vel­op­ment of the kind of close and ex­clu­sion­ary strate­gic align­ments which Can­berra’s new poli­cies seem to en­vis­age.</p>
    <p>There is no sign that Can­berra is will­ing to un­der­take the kind of in­ten­sive diplo­macy that would be re­quired to bring its neigh­bours around to its vi­sion. Nor does it show any sign of be­ing will­ing to ac­com­mo­date that vi­sion to the in­ter­ests and per­spec­tives of its pro­posed part­ners.</p>
    <p>The other big question is what kind of mil­i­tary con­tri­bu­tion Aus­tralia would be able to make to the se­cu­rity of its neigh­bours in the event of the kind of high-in­ten­sity con­flict which is now as­sessed as be­ing more likely.</p>
    <p>WHERE’S THE MONEY?</p>
    <p>For some time, Aus­tralia has been in­vest­ing tens of bil­lions of dol­lars in ships de­signed to let it de­ploy am­phibi­ous land forces in such a con­tin­gency. The up­date makes no changes to these planned forces, but it is un­clear how they could of­fer much help to other coun­tries in a ma­jor war with China.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s army is far too small to make any ma­te­rial dif­fer­ence to any land war in Asia, and the big ships it is build­ing would be easy tar­gets for China’s for­mi­da­ble air and naval forces.</p>
    <p>Above all, the new pol­icy does noth­ing to ad­dress the sim­ple fact that Aus­tralia is sim­ply not spend­ing enough on de­fence to be a se­ri­ous part­ner for its neigh­bours in se­cur­ing shared in­ter­ests in the decades ahead.</p>
    <p>In launch­ing the up­date, the Morrison gov­ern­ment an­nounced that A$270 bil­lion (S$263 bil­lion) would be spent on new ca­pa­bil­i­ties over the next decade. What it did not say was that al­most all of this huge sum had been com­mit­ted un­der pre­vi­ous gov­ern­ments.</p>
    <p>The re­al­ity, then, is that de­spite the very real in­creased strate­gic risks that it de­scribes, the new de­fence pol­icy does not com­mit to any sig­nif­i­cant growth in de­fence spend­ing. And while it men­tions plans for new mis­sile and space ca­pa­bil­i­ties, no sig­nif­i­cant new funds are pro­vided for them.</p>
    <p>Can­berra plans for the de­fence bud­get to re­main around 2 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, which was the level set some 25 years ago when Asia was at peace and Aus­tralia’s econ­omy was much larger rel­a­tive to key pow­ers like China’s than it is now.</p>
    <p>That makes no sense to­day as Aus­tralia’s strate­gic risks grow, while its eco­nomic weight shrinks.</p>
    <p>If Can­berra is se­ri­ous about play­ing a sig­nif­i­cant strate­gic role in its re­gion over the decades to come, it will have no choice but to spend a lot more on de­fence, and to spend it a lot more wisely.</p>
    <p>In the 1950s and 1960s, Aus­tralia spent be­tween 3.5 per cent and 4 per cent of GDP on de­fence. It could af­ford to reach those lev­els again if gov­ern­ments were de­ter­mined to in­crease Aus­tralia’s strate­gic weight to match its grow­ing strate­gic risks.</p>
    <p>The fact that the up­date avoids hard choices by leav­ing so much of the sub­stance of Aus­tralia’s de­fence plan­ning un­changed shows that for all the tough talk, Can­berra has still not wo­ken up to how fast things in Asia are chang­ing.</p>
