    <p>SPA • Hav­ing tri­umphed here three times pre­vi­ously, Lewis Hamil­ton showed why he is the favourite to win the Bel­gian Grand Prix by putting Mercedes on pole.</p>
    <p>The six-time For­mula One cham­pion and cham­pi­onship leader could not be caught in qual­i­fy­ing yes­ter­day, out­pac­ing team­mate Val­terri Bot­tas in se­cond, while Red Bull’s Max Ver­stap­pen was third, ahead of Daniel Ric­cia­rdo of Re­nault.</p>
    <p>He de­liv­ered t wo suc­ces­sive record-break­ing qual­i­fy­ing laps to claim his sixth Bel­gian Grand Prix pole and a record-ex­tend­ing 93rd of his ca­reer with a flaw­less demon­stra­tion of speed.</p>
    <p>The Bri­ton clocked a best lap of one minute and 41.252 sec­onds in the fi­nal sec­onds of a ses­sion that he dom­i­nated. It was a per­sonal trib­ute to Hol­ly­wood ac­tor and the star of Marvel block­buster Black Pan­ther, Chad­wick Bose­man, who died on Friday af­ter a four-year bat­tle with colon can­cer.</p>
    <p>It was Hamil­ton’s fifth pole in seven races this year, a feat he said he had wanted to achieve in mem­ory of the 43-year-old Amer­i­can, whose life had been an in­spi­ra­tion to him.</p>
    <p>“This is a re­ally im­por­tant pole for me be­cause I woke up to the sad­dest news of Chad­wick pass­ing away... It has been such a heavy year for all of us, so it rocked me,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I wanted to go out there and drive to per­fec­tion be­cause of what he has done for our peo­ple and how he has shown young (black) kids what is pos­si­ble. Wakanda for­ever.</p>
    <p>“To­day was a very, very clean ses­sion for me and the end of the lap was get­ting bet­ter and bet­ter. We did such a lot of work for this in the back­ground.”</p>
    <p>Last year’s win­ners Fer­rari, how­ever, suf­fered a dis­ap­point­ing ses­sion with both driv­ers un­able to make the top 10.</p>
    <p>Charles Le­clerc, who claimed his maiden F1 vic­tory in Spa last year, was 13th and four-time cham­pion Se­bas­tian Vet­tel a fur­ther slot be­hind.</p>
    <p>Team boss Mat­tia Binotto had warned on Friday that Fer­rari faced a host of is­sues at the long, de­mand­ing and high-speed Spa-Fran­cor­champs cir­cuit and so it proved.</p>
    <p>The Scud­e­ria have strug­gled this year with a power deficit to their ri­vals, but Binotto re­vealed speed was only one of their prob­lems, amid a strug­gle to warm up their tyres and find bal­ance.</p>
    <p>“We are lack­ing grip, both in brak­ing and ac­cel­er­a­tion. There is no over­all per­for­mance to the car,” the Ital­ian said.</p>
    <p>“So cer­tainly, the driv­ers are com­plain­ing about grip, over­all grip. It’s the same sit­u­a­tion on both cars, so it’s not driver re­lated. It’s re­ally the way we set up the car in or­der to find the right win­dow on the tyres.”</p>
