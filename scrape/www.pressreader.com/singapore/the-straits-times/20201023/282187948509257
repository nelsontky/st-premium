    <p>• A feared wave of cor­po­rate bank­rupt­cies has yet to ma­te­ri­alise in Asia, due to a lot of help from pol­i­cy­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>If any­thing, the num­ber of com­pa­nies go­ing out of busi­ness has dropped from last year in coun­tries such as Ja­pan and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>This sug­gests that of­fi­cial mea­sures to pre­vent cor­po­rate fail­ures, in tan­dem with global stim­u­lus of some US$12 tril­lion (S$16.3 tril­lion), may be bear­ing fruit.</p>
    <p>Global lock­downs prompted by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic have wrecked eco­nomic growth and led to bank­rupt­cies of firms – from Brooks Brothers Group to Hertz Global Hold­ings and Vir­gin Aus­tralia Hold­ings.</p>
    <p>But fund­ing pro­vi­sions and other help from pol­i­cy­mak­ers ap­pear to have pre­vented many strug­gling com­pa­nies from clos­ing down for good.</p>
    <p>In the United States, Gold­man Sachs Group says the num­ber of bank­ruptcy fil­ings has been lower than ex­pected due in part to fed­eral re­lief. In Europe, cor­po­rate fail­ures de­clined in Bri­tain and Swe­den in the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Here are key de­vel­op­ments across Asia.</p>
    <p>JA­PAN</p>
    <p>Bank­rupt­cies de­clined in the six months through last month to the low­est since 1990, as govern­ment and cen­tral bank mea­sures helped sup­port trou­bled firms. The num­ber of cases fell 9.4 per cent to 3,858 cases ver­sus the same pe­riod last year, ac­cord­ing to data from Tokyo Shoko Re­search.</p>
    <p>Still, restau­rants and ho­tels have been hit hard. The govern­ment’s ramped-up fur­lough pro­gramme will be run­ning till the end of the year, while the Bank of Ja­pan’s loan fa­cil­ity pro­gramme is set to last through next March.</p>
    <p>IN­DIA</p>
    <p>The govern­ment sus­pended bank­ruptcy fil­ings from the end of March. Only 76 cases filed be­fore the mora­to­rium be­gan were ad­mit­ted into the res­o­lu­tion process in the April-to-June pe­riod, com­pared with the usual 300 to 600 in a quar­ter. Un­prece­dented stim­u­lus steps, in­clud­ing a 21 tril­lion ru­pee (S$387 bil­lion) res­cue pack­age, have helped bor­row­ers stay afloat.</p>
    <p>But strug­gling small busi­nesses need to re­pay mount­ing debt after a loan hol­i­day ended in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>And un­em­ploy­ment presents a se­ri­ous chal­lenge: Over four mil­lion young In­di­ans have lost their jobs due to Covid-19, mostly in the constructi­on and farm sec­tors, ac­cord­ing to a re­port by the In­ter­na­tional Labour Or­gan­i­sa­tion and the Asian De­vel­op­ment Bank.</p>
    <p>CHINA</p>
    <p>The na­tion’s cor­po­rate de­fault fig­ures sug­gest a turn­around in com­pa­nies’ fi­nan­cial health: Missed debt pay­ments in the do­mes­tic mar­ket have de­creased nearly 18 per cent so far this year, after two straight years of record de­faults.</p>
    <p>That was partly the re­sult of mar­ket in­ter­est-rate cuts and pro­vi­sion of abun­dant cash by the au­thor­i­ties, as well as dis­tressed bor­row­ers be­ing urged to take steps such as de­lay­ing bond re­pay­ments and debt swaps to avoid de­faults.</p>
    <p>The world’s sec­ond-largest econ­omy con­tin­ued to re­cover in the third quar­ter, with con­sumer spend­ing ac­cel­er­at­ing last month.</p>
    <p>HONG KONG</p>
    <p>The govern­ment has em­barked on re­lief spend­ing of more than HK$310 bil­lion (S$54 bil­lion) to fight what economists sur­veyed by Bloomberg ex­pect to be a record eco­nomic con­trac­tion this year. That has helped pre­vent worse fall­out, even as many com­pa­nies in the re­tail and ser­vice-de­pen­dent econ­omy have stum­bled.</p>
    <p>Cor­po­rate fail­ures are usu­ally han­dled through an in­sol­vency process. Pe­ti­tions for com­pul­sory wind­ing-up of firms peaked at 68 in May, the most for any month since 2009, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial statis­tics. There were a to­tal of 275 such fil­ings from Jan­uary to Au­gust, the most since the same pe­riod in 2016.</p>
    <p>SIN­GA­PORE</p>
    <p>Len­ders have been pro­vid­ing pay­ment de­fer­rals since April for small and medium-sized busi­nesses. They will ex­tend debt re­lief be­yond the ini­tially sched­uled year end, with the time pe­ri­ods depend­ing on how much help in­dus­tries need, ac­cord­ing to the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The ef­forts ap­pear to be pay­ing off. Ap­pli­ca­tions filed for cor­po­rate liq­ui­da­tions fell to just four in Au­gust, the low­est since at least 2015, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial data.</p>
    <p>In­di­vid­ual bank­ruptcy fil­ings are also de­creas­ing, hit­ting a record-low 43 in May after jump­ing to 462 in March.</p>
    <p>The fig­ure in Au­gust was 131, be­low the av­er­age of 257 since 2004.</p>
    <p>IN­DONE­SIA</p>
    <p>Bank­ruptcy fil­ings this year in the Cen­tral Jakarta district court, one of the na­tion’s main venues for such mat­ters, have been in line with last year’s fig­ures, at 378.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia an­nounced US$10 bil­lion i n fi­nan­cial sup­port to a dozen state-owned com­pa­nies in May. The govern­ment has also pledged to in­ject additional cap­i­tal of around 37 tril­lion ru­piah (S$3.4 bil­lion) for sev­eral other com­pa­nies next year.</p>
    <p>SOUTH KOREA</p>
    <p>Bank­rupt­cies this year also largely stayed around the same level – at 1,492 through last month com­pared with 1,423 a year ear­lier – ac­cord­ing to court data.</p>
    <p>The coun­try cre­ated a 40 tril­lion won (S$47.8 bil­lion) fund in May to pre­vent com­pa­nies from col­laps­ing in key in­dus­tries such as avi­a­tion and ship­build­ing.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral bank has kept in­ter­est rates at a record low but has steered clear of full-scale quan­ti­ta­tive eas­ing after re­cent ex­port and in­fla­tion data sug­gested that the econ­omy has passed the worst of the slump.</p>
