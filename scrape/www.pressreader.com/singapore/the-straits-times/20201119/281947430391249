    <p>My fam­ily and I would like to ex­tend our ap­pre­ci­a­tion to Mr Ong Eng Huat of Hol­land-Bukit Pan­jang Town Coun­cil and su­per­vi­sor Ha­viv and his team from LS 2 Ser­vices for their help.</p>
    <p>My wheel­chair-us­ing mother had med­i­cal ap­point­ments dur­ing the time the lift at her block was shut down for main­te­nance. Mr Ong ar­ranged for his col­leagues to carry my mother in her wheel­chair down from the third floor and back up after her ap­point­ments.</p>
    <p>My mother is over­weight and it was no easy task. We are grate­ful and touched by their act.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing lived in Toh Yi es­tate for the past 32 years, I have no­ticed that the work­ers go be­yond their ba­sic duty of keep­ing the es­tate clean, in­clud­ing help­ing me to carry stuff to the bin cen­tre.</p>
