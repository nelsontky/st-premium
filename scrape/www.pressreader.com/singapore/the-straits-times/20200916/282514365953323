    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has brought Sin­ga­pore’s sport cal­en­dar to a stand­still, with mar­quee events such as the For­mula One’s Sin­ga­pore Air­lines Sin­ga­pore Grand Prix, HSBC Sin­ga­pore Rugby Sev­ens and foot­ball’s In­ter­na­tional Cham­pi­ons Cup axed.</p>
    <p>Al­though there is un­cer­tainty over whether these events will re­turn any time soon, Sport Sin­ga­pore (SportSG) chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Lim Teck Yin be­lieves that the Sin­ga­pore Sev­ens “looks set to be staged” in April ahead of the post­poned Tokyo Olympics in July.</p>
    <p>Host­ing the event at the Na­tional Sta­dium could also demon­strate that Sin­ga­pore is open for busi­ness, said Lim at the All That Mat­ters busi­ness fes­ti­val yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing dur­ing an online ses­sion, he said: “We are work­ing hard on the as­sump­tion that it (Sin­ga­pore Sev­ens) will hap­pen and that we will be able to cre­ate an en­gage­ment propo­si­tion with fans around the world that al­lows us to show­case that Sin­ga­pore is open for busi­ness, show­case that a sport­ing event of that stature can still be run by bring­ing peo­ple to­gether in a safe en­vi­ron­ment and to be able to en­gage at scale across the world, both dig­i­tally online as well as on tra­di­tional broad­cast.”</p>
    <p>But the SportSG chief also em­pha­sised the need to eval­u­ate the sit­u­a­tion and whether it would make sense to open up travel for in­ter­na­tional teams and ath­letes.</p>
    <p>The can­cel­la­tion of in­ter­na­tional and lo­cal sport events has also high­lighted the im­por­tance of rais­ing the stan­dards of the domestic sport leagues so that Sin­ga­pore is not en­tirely re­liant on such events to keep lo­cal fans en­ter­tained, said Lim.</p>
    <p>While he did not pro­vide more de­tails, the 57-year-old said: “It would prob­a­bly mean an­other form of a semi-pro­fes­sional, domestic league, bring­ing in star at­trac­tions to fea­ture for the teams, and make it a good propo­si­tion for us to de­velop our own ath­letes as well as to pro­vide that en­ter­tain­ment.”</p>
    <p>Ahead of next year’s SEA Games in Viet­nam, which is sched­uled for Nov 21 to Dec 2, he also said that it was cru­cial for coun­tries in the re­gion to work to­gether to bring back sport in their re­spec­tive coun­tries and also com­pe­ti­tions be­tween coun­tries.</p>
    <p>As sport and phys­i­cal ac­tiv­i­ties re­sume in phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing, Lim said the first steps would be fo­cused on allowing more peo­ple to play sport.</p>
    <p>With the current limit of five peo­ple with no inter-mix­ing be­tween groups among the safety mea­sures, team sports such as foot­ball may take a lit­tle longer to re­turn.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Pre­mier League clubs were given the nod to re­sume full con­tact train­ing from Sept 1 and the league is look­ing at a pos­si­ble restart be­fore the end of the month.</p>
    <p>The restart could pave the way for the re­sump­tion of other domestic leagues and even­tu­ally team sports for all, said Lim.</p>
    <p>But he stressed that this would de­pend on the Gov­ern­ment’s di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>He added: “In all cases, safe man­age­ment mea­sures con­tinue to rule so we have to be mind­ful and fol­low the na­tional pro­file.</p>
    <p>“That pro­file as you know in other in­dus­tries is start­ing to open up.</p>
    <p>“If ev­ery­one can play their part, by end of next year, I hope that we can see sport (as we know it) back and we are de­ter­mined to make sure that hap­pens.”</p>
