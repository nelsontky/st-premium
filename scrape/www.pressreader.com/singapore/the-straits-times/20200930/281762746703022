    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, un­der fire over his han­dling of the coro­n­avirus epi­demic, has an­nounced that the fed­eral govern­ment would ship 150 mil­lion rapid tests to states across the US and warned that an in­crease in pos­i­tive cases is likely in the days ahead.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump on Mon­day said the tests would largely be used for open­ing schools and en­sur­ing safety at cen­tres for se­nior cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>He has been pres­sur­ing state gov­er­nors to do more to open schools for in-per­son learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence and virus ad­viser Scott At­las warned that more pos­i­tive cases may re­sult from stepped-up test­ing.</p>
    <p>“With cases and pos­i­tiv­ity ris­ing in 10 states in the Mid­west and the near-west, and with this his­toric ad­vance in test­ing that’s be­ing dis­trib­uted... the Amer­i­can peo­ple should an­tic­i­pate that cases will rise in the days ahead,” Mr Pence said.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent has re­peat­edly sug­gested that more test­ing leads to more cases, when in fact test­ing un­cov­ers cases that al­ready ex­ist.</p>
    <p>Other met­rics like in­creased hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions and deaths have no link to more test­ing.</p>
    <p>The United States has the world’s high­est num­ber of con­firmed Covid-19 cases, at more than seven mil­lion, and the most coro­n­avirus-re­lated deaths, at more than 205,000.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the coro­n­avirus task force – Dr An­thony Fauci, Dr Deb­o­rah Birx and Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion di­rec­tor Robert Red­field – were not at Mon­day’s event.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump said 50 mil­lion tests will go to the “most vul­ner­a­ble com­mu­ni­ties”, in­clud­ing nursing homes, as­sisted liv­ing fa­cil­i­ties, home health and hos­pice care. Nearly one mil­lion will be sent to his­tor­i­cally black col­leges and uni­ver­si­ties and tribal na­tion col­leges.</p>
    <p>He also said 100 mil­lion tests will be given to states and ter­ri­to­ries to “sup­port ef­forts to re­open their economies and schools im­me­di­ately and (as) fast as they can”.</p>
    <p>“The sup­port my ad­min­is­tra­tion is pro­vid­ing would al­low ev­ery state on a very reg­u­lar ba­sis to test ev­ery teacher who needs it,” he said, adding that 6.5 mil­lion tests will go out this week and the rest in the com­ing weeks.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump is try­ing to show progress in the bat­tle against the pan­demic as he cam­paigns for re-elec­tion on Nov 3 against Demo­crat Joe Bi­den.</p>
