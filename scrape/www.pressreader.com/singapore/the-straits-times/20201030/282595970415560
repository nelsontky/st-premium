    <p>Barcelona’s 2-0 win away to Ju­ven­tus i n the Cham­pi­ons League was the per­fect re­ply to the club’s board­room cri­sis, Sergi Roberto said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The club were rocked when their pres­i­dent Josep Maria Bar­tomeu re­signed on Tues­day to avoid fac­ing a vote of no con­fi­dence af­ter some 20,000 fans signed a pe­ti­tion de­mand­ing that he step down.</p>
    <p>“The best an­swer was to­day’s game. We want to win ti­tles and matches as we showed to­day,” said home-grown mid­fielder Sergi Roberto.</p>
    <p>“It’s all in the past, we’re con­cen­trat­ing on our job.”</p>
    <p>Coach Ron­ald Koe­man said his team had tried to put the board­room is­sue out of their minds.</p>
    <p>“I think we have to con­cen­trate on the sport­ing side,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It doesn’t af­fect us and it doesn’t worry me. We put our en­ergy into foot­ball.”</p>
    <p>Barcelona have won both their games in the Cham­pi­ons League, a sharp con­trast to their La Liga form. They are win­less in their last three league games.</p>
    <p>“This was our best game all sea­son. This is a big win against an im­por­tant Euro­pean side and we were able to play the foot­ball we’re try­ing to im­pose,” Koe­man added.</p>
    <p>“It is al­ways im­por­tant to cre­ate chances. We were su­pe­rior by play­ing our game. It was the right re­sult.”</p>
    <p>Juve’s Cris­tiano Ron­aldo missed the clash, two weeks af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The Por­tuguese su­per­star, 35, could not pro­vide a neg­a­tive test 24 hours be­fore the game and has re­port­edly tested pos­i­tive 18 times.</p>
    <p>His great ri­val Lionel Messi, 33, set up back-in-favour Ous­mane Dem­bele to put Barca in front af­ter a quar­ter of an hour in Turin, adding a se­cond him­self from the penalty spot in stop­page time.</p>
    <p>Al­varo Mo­rata had three goals ruled out for off­side for Juve, who played the fi­nal five min­utes a man down af­ter Merih Demi­ral was sent off for a se­cond yel­low card.</p>
    <p>Barcelona are top of Group G with six points af­ter two games with Ju­ven­tus on three. The re­verse fix­ture takes place at the Nou Camp on Dec 8.</p>
    <p>It was a first de­feat for new Ju­ven­tus coach An­drea Pirlo, whose last game as a player for the Turin gi­ants was a loss to Barcelona in the 2015 Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal.</p>
    <p>“We knew it would be a dif­fi­cult game, they are fur­ther along the path, they have play­ers more ex­pe­ri­enced in these games, while we are un­der con­struc­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We need to grow. I hope to have the other play­ers back soon.</p>
    <p>“I have no other so­lu­tions, those who play have to stay 90 min­utes, so it’s dif­fi­cult when there are matches close to­gether.”</p>
