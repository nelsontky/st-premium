    <p>Len­ovo used to call its two-in-one con­vert­ibles Yoga, which I found very ap­pro­pri­ate, see­ing as these de­vices re­lied on a flex­i­ble 360de­gree hinge to switch be­tween lap­top and tablet form.</p>
    <p>But two years ago, Len­ovo changed its Yoga brand­ing to re­fer to its pre­mium con­sumer mod­els. Thus, my ex­pec­ta­tions were raised even be­fore setting my eyes on the new Len­ovo Yoga Slim 7 lap­top.</p>
    <p>Adding to my high hopes was its AMD Ryzen 7 pro­ces­sor, an eight­core chip that should ex­cel in pro­ces­sor-heavy work­loads like 3D ren­der­ing and video edit­ing.</p>
    <p>Nat­u­rally, the first thing I did was to in­stall the PCMark 10 bench­mark to test the note­book’s per­for­mance. The Slim 7 scored 5,226, sig­nif­i­cantly higher than the 4,556 achieved by the Len­ovo IdeaPad Slim 5i, which has an In­tel Core i7-1065G7.</p>
    <p>No­tably, the Slim 7 did very well in the Dig­i­tal Con­tent Cre­ation por­tion of PCMark 10, which in­volves video and im­age edit­ing. Its 5,442 score is much higher than the 3,555 man­aged by the In­tel-pow­ered Slim 5i.</p>
    <p>Thanks to its alu­minium body, the Slim 7 feels solid with just a hint of flex when I press down on the palm rest. My re­view set comes in a non­de­script matte grey that quickly picks up fin­ger­prints and other stains.</p>
    <p>The lid can be opened up to al­most 180 de­grees with one hand. The mid­dle por­tion of the top bezel pro­trudes slightly, mak­ing it easy to grip the lid. This so-called “re­verse notch” de­sign also en­sures that the top bezel is suf­fi­ciently thick in the mid­dle to ac­com­mo­date an in­frared Web cam­era for fa­cial recog­ni­tion.</p>
    <p>Some vari­ants of the Slim 7 may in­clude a fin­ger­print sen­sor in­te­grated into the power but­ton, which is lo­cated at the side. My re­view set has only fa­cial recog­ni­tion, which works as ex­pected.</p>
    <p>Its 14-inch dis­play has a glossy glass cover that ini­tially fools me into think­ing it is a touch­screen. The screen is fairly re­flec­tive.</p>
    <p>Dolby Vi­sion is sup­ported, which means that in Net­flix shows that sup­port this high dy­namic range for­mat, the screen be­comes very bright. Colours do not ap­pear richer than other lap­top dis­plays, though.</p>
    <p>En­hanc­ing its cre­den­tials as a mul­ti­me­dia pow­er­house are stereo speak­ers lo­cated at the sides of the key­board. They are loud with enough body to fill the room, though there is not much bass to speak of.</p>
    <p>Like some of Len­ovo’s other note­books, the Slim 7 comes with Glance by Mi­rametrix, a soft­ware that uses the Web cam­era to track your eyes for pri­vacy and se­cu­rity. For in­stance, the fea­ture can au­to­mat­i­cally blur the screen to de­ter pry­ing eyes when you step away from the lap­top.</p>
    <p>Per­haps I am used to Len­ovo’s key­boards, but I achieved one of my higher typ­ing speeds (76 words per minute) on the Slim 7’s key­board. It is tac­tile and com­fort­able, though the keys feel shal­lower than Len­ovo’s ThinkPad mod­els.</p>
    <p>I like that the Slim 7 is charged via a USB Type-C port us­ing the in­cluded power adapter. Its HDMI port is also handy for most users, see­ing as mon­i­tors and tele­vi­sion sets still use this in­ter­face. How­ever, in­clud­ing Thun­der­bolt 3 would have been nice.</p>
    <p>While the Slim 7 feels a tad heav­ier than some 14-inch mod­els, there is a good rea­son for this – it has a large 60 watt-hour bat­tery. In our video-loop bat­tery test, the Slim 7 man­aged 9hr 13min, one of the best in the ul­tra­books I have tested.</p>
