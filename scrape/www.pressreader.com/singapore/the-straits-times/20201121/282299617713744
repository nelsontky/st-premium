    <p>Uniqlo’s launch of its lat­est cloth­ing col­lec­tion de­signed with Ger­man fash­ion de­signer Jil Sander at­tracted long queues at its flag­ship out­let in Or­chard Cen­tral yes­ter­day. About 160 peo­ple were seen queue­ing at around 10.30am be­fore the store opened at 11am.</p>
    <p>The +J Fall/Win­ter 2020 col­lec­tion marks the sec­ond time Uniqlo has col­lab­o­rated with Ms Sander since 2009. Mr Calvin Ong, a fash­ion con­sul­tant in his 40s who ar­rived at 9.30am and was 25th in line, said: “I have waited for around a decade for the re­turn of this col­lab­o­ra­tion. Her cloth­ing is usu­ally very ex­pen­sive.”</p>
    <p>To en­sure safe-dis­tanc­ing, queue num­bers and en­try tick­ets were is­sued, and a max­i­mum of 20 cus­tomers were al­lowed into the +J shop­ping area in the store at each time, said Uniqlo.</p>
    <p>Each cus­tomer was lim­ited to pur­chas­ing five items, but ac­ces­sories such as belts were mostly sold out by 8pm, with men’s and women’s Supima cot­ton over­sized shirts fly­ing off the racks. In an­tic­i­pa­tion of fur­ther de­mand, stock from se­lected smaller stores was moved to the flag­ship store, Uniqlo said.</p>
