    <p>Thai Premier Prayut Chan-o-cha yes­ter­day apol­o­gised for lapses over two cases that sparked panic about re­newed com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion of Covid-19 in the king­dom, af­ter more than a month of be­ing in the clear.</p>
    <p>The two cases in­volved a nineyear-old daugh­ter of a Su­danese diplo­mat and an Egyp­tian mil­i­tary of­fi­cer who had been on a lay­over in Thai­land.</p>
    <p>Patchy de­tails re­leased on Mon­day about their move­ments in Bangkok and Ray­ong province re­spec­tively sent the Thai ru­mour mill into over­drive and sparked pub­lic anger about dou­ble stan­dards.</p>
    <p>The coun­try is now re­view­ing all its rules, in­clud­ing those that al­low ar­riv­ing diplo­mats to iso­late them­selves at home for 14 days, in­stead of be­ing quar­an­tined at a des­ig­nated fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>The Su­danese girl was di­ag­nosed with Covid-19 on the same day the fam­ily ar­rived from Su­dan, which has over 10,000 coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily iso­lated them­selves in their Bangkok con­do­minium af­ter the girl was trans­ferred to a hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>“I ask for your trust and I am sorry and apol­o­gise to all Thais. This is un­prece­dented,” said Mr Prayut.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the day, the Cen­tre for Covid-19 Sit­u­a­tion Ad­min­is­tra­tion (CCSA) re­leased de­tailed time­lines of the two pa­tients’ move­ments, partly to dampen spec­u­la­tion on so­cial me­dia that sev­eral well-known malls in down­town Bangkok were pos­si­bly af­fected.</p>
    <p>The Thai army on Mon­day de­nied it had any­thing to do with the Egyp­tian mil­i­tary of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>He had checked into a ho­tel in Ray­ong last week with a del­e­ga­tion af­ter ar­riv­ing at U-Ta­pao air­port as part of a multi-leg jour­ney that also took him to the United Arab Emi­rates, Pak­istan and China.</p>
    <p>He was ex­empted from the manda­tory 14-day quar­an­tine that ap­plied to ar­rivals in Thai­land.</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, he vis­ited a mall in Ray­ong with his com­pa­tri­ots.</p>
    <p>His test re­sults came back pos­i­tive only af­ter he had left Thai­land on Satur­day. The CCSA dis­closed that the del­e­ga­tion had ini­tially re­sisted be­ing tested for Covid-19. Mr Prayut al­leged bad faith.</p>
    <p>“It was a mil­i­tary flight, and they were sup­posed to abide by the mu­tual agree­ment. But they vi­o­lated it, and ven­tured out of their res­i­dence,” he said.</p>
    <p>CCSA spokesman Taweesilp Visanuyoth­in said his unit ac­cepted re­spon­si­bil­ity for the slipup. “We apol­o­gise to the peo­ple in Ray­ong and Bangkok.</p>
    <p>“This has af­fected thou­sands of peo­ple and more than 10 schools needed to be closed. We will do bet­ter,” he said.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials are now look­ing into re­vok­ing land­ing per­mis­sion for other Egyp­tian flights given the green light ear­lier.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, the Egyp­tian Em­bassy in Thai­land ex­pressed “its most sin­cere re­grets and sym­pa­thies to all those who may have been ad­versely af­fected”, and said it was com­mit­ted to ad­her­ing to Thai­land’s rules to pre­vent the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>Thais are largely wary of ef­forts at eas­ing curbs. Most re­spon­dents in a sur­vey con­ducted by the Na­tional In­sti­tute of De­vel­op­ment Ad­min­is­tra­tion last week were op­posed to an ar­range­ment al­low­ing med­i­cal tourists who had tested neg­a­tive and served a 14-day quar­an­tine pe­riod to travel around the coun­try.</p>
