    <p>US Open win­ner Do­minic Thiem nav­i­gated a test­ing firstround French Open tie against for­mer Ma­jor cham­pion Marin Cilic yes­ter­day, win­ning 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing cap­tured his maiden Slam in New York, he is try­ing to be­come the only man in the Open era to win his first two Ma­jors at suc­ces­sive tour­na­ments.</p>
    <p>A steady dis­play from him saw the Aus­trian break Cilic six times un­der the roof of Court Philippe Cha­trier on an­other gloomy day at Roland Gar­ros, pushed back from its cus­tom­ary May-June slot due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Many play­ers have been low­er­ing the ten­sion in their racket strings to counter the heavy, damp con­di­tions for the later-than-usual clay­court event in Paris. But Thiem was tightly wound and straight into the groove as he sent the 2014 US Open cham­pion, ranked 40th and un­seeded at a Grand Slam for the first time since that year’s Aus­tralian Open, pack­ing in em­phatic fash­ion.</p>
    <p>Next up for Thiem is Amer­i­can qual­i­fier Jack Sock, a for­mer top 10 player who is now ranked No. 310.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally love this tour­na­ment, it’s by far my best Grand Slam tour­na­ment so far,” said Thiem, the run­ner-up to Rafael Nadal here the past two years.</p>
    <p>“I’m re­ally happy with my first round. The tran­si­tion to the cold con­di­tions and clay worked re­ally well. I’m from Aus­tria so I know how it is to play in these cold con­di­tions. I love it when it’s not too fast. I felt well from the first mo­ment I came here.”</p>
    <p>The one-sided af­fair fol­lowed Sun­day’s clash be­tween two other Grand Slam cham­pi­ons in Stan Wawrinka and Andy Mur­ray – the first time since 1999 that ma­jor win­ners met in the first round.</p>
    <p>What was billed as an open­ing­day clas­sic be­tween two old war­riors turned into a damp squib as the 35-year-old Swiss crushed Mur­ray 6-1, 6-3, 6-2.</p>
    <p>“I need to have a long hard think about it. It’s not the sort of match I would just brush aside and not think about it,” Mur­ray, whose pre­vi­ous worst loss was a 6-3, 6-2, 6-1 ham­mer­ing at the hands of Rafa Nadal at the 2014 French Open, said. “I need to un­der­stand why the per­for­mance was like that.”</p>
    <p>Mur­ray was com­pet­ing in a clay­court event for the first time since his five-set loss to Wawrinka in the 2017 French Open semi-fi­nal and landed only 36 per cent of his first serves. The Scots­man, who cited that match as “the end of my hip”, has been run­ning a long bat­tle ever since with an in­jury that once threat­ened to de­stroy his ca­reer.</p>
    <p>He needed a wild card to play in Paris and seven-time Grand Slam win­ner Mats Wi­lan­der con­tro­ver­sially sug­gested that the 33-yearold should re­tire from ten­nis.</p>
    <p>The Swede told Eurosport: “I keep get­ting a lit­tle bit dis­ap­pointed, is it his right to be out there do­ing that? Why? I did it and I shouldn’t have, it was the big­gest mis­take I did in my ca­reer. I think Andy Mur­ray needs to stop think­ing of him­self and start think­ing about who he was. Does he have a right to be out there tak­ing wild cards from the young play­ers?”</p>
    <p>The mer­cu­rial Aus­tralian Nick Kyr­gios leapt to the de­fence of Mur­ray, telling Wi­lan­der to “shut up” as no­body cares what he thinks.</p>
    <p>“Muzz, just know that how ever long you stay, we all ap­pre­ci­ate and en­joy your ten­nis and ban­ter. Also I’ve never watched a point of Mats Wi­lan­der,” he added on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Mur­ray in­sisted he in­tends to keep play­ing even though his rank­ing is No. 111.</p>
    <p>He also found sup­port from for­mer coach Daniel Val­lverdu who coached him from 2010-2014.</p>
    <p>“He’s en­ti­tled to his opin­ion. Like I’m en­ti­tled to mine to think that’s ab­so­lutely PA­THETIC from Mats...,” tweeted Val­lverdu, now the coach of Wawrinka.</p>
