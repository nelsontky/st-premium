    <p>Com­pa­nies that hire more lo­cals in the com­ing months will get help in pay­ing up to half of their wages, in a clear sig­nal to firms to bring for­ward their hir­ing plans and cre­ate more jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans. But for that to hap­pen, and in or­der to at­tract in­vest­ments, Sin­ga­pore must stay open and com­pet­i­tive, the Gov­ern­ment urged.</p>
    <p>Firms that hire more lo­cals in the com­ing months will get help in pay­ing up to half of their wages, in a clear sig­nal to com­pa­nies to bring for­ward their hir­ing plans and cre­ate more jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>At the same time, jobs will spring up and in­vest­ments will flow Sin­ga­pore’s way if it stays open and com­pet­i­tive, the Gov­ern­ment said as Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day con­cluded a week-long de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress that fre­quently re­turned to jobs and strength­en­ing the Sin­ga­porean core amid a re­ces­sion in­duced by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>For new lo­cal hires over the next six months, com­pa­nies could get up to $15,000 for each worker be­low the age of 40, and up to $30,000 for each older worker, un­der the new $1 bil­lion Jobs Growth In­cen­tive scheme.</p>
    <p>The pay­outs will be made over 12 months from next March and will be au­to­mat­i­cally com­puted each month based on a com­pany’s Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund con­tri­bu­tions, the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) and the In­land Rev­enue Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (Iras) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Es­sen­tially, the Gov­ern­ment will co-pay one quar­ter of the first $5,000 of gross monthly wages for one year, with this dou­bled to 50 per cent for each new ma­ture hire.</p>
    <p>The scheme was first flagged by Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat last month to boost hir­ing of lo­cals in growth sec­tors, on top of wage sub­si­dies un­der the Jobs Sup­port Scheme, which will cover wages paid up to March next year.</p>
    <p>It is a step up in terms of level of salary sup­port com­pared with the En­hanced Hir­ing In­cen­tive an­nounced ear­lier in May.</p>
    <p>Wrap­ping up the de­bate in Par­lia­ment, Na­tional Trades Union Congress as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Pa­trick Tay said em­ploy­ers have an im­por­tant role to play to build up their Sin­ga­porean core – par­tic­u­larly given the un­cer­tain times – and must re­trench Sin­ga­pore­ans only as a last re­sort.</p>
    <p>But while MOM has said it is tak­ing a closer scru­tiny of firms whose Sin­ga­porean core has been weak­en­ing, the sus­tain­able path for­ward for Sin­ga­pore is to grow the econ­omy by stay­ing open to for­eign­ers and in­vest­ments, he said.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think we just want to set­tle with hav­ing the cake and eat­ing it, but we want to grow and en­large the cake, thereby giv­ing Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore­ans a big­ger and bet­ter – and also the best – slice of it.”</p>
    <p>He stressed: “Strength­en­ing our Sin­ga­porean core is not, and must not be, some­thing which di­vides us.”</p>
    <p>The point was also driven home by Min­is­ter for Trans­port Ong Ye Kung, who said the Sin­ga­pore way has not been to turn in­ward, but to be open and hold its own against the com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>“Don’t make our­selves a small pond, live in the pond and feel we are great, we are a big fish in the pond, but open up to the la­goon, open up to the sea, have a much more ex­cit­ing, di­verse ecosys­tem, but in­vest in our own peo­ple, hold our own,” said Mr Ong, who is also a Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) board mem­ber. “That is what we have been do­ing for decades.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said MAS will en­sure fair hir­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties while groom­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans as lead­ers and spe­cial­ists in the fi­nan­cial sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Join­ing the de­bate, Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion Min­is­ter S. Iswaran said Sin­ga­pore can do bet­ter if it finds the right bal­ance be­tween open­ness and in­clu­siv­ity by pre­serv­ing a sense of fair­ness, whether in ac­cess to op­por­tu­ni­ties or the way the ben­e­fits of growth are dis­trib­uted.</p>
    <p>To be el­i­gi­ble for the Jobs In­cen­tive Scheme, firms must in­crease the head­count of their lo­cal work­force be­tween this month and Fe­bru­ary, com­pared with Au­gust. They must also raise the size of their lo­cal work­force earn­ing at least $1,400 in gross monthly wages.</p>
    <p>The scheme will ap­ply only to firms that were set up on or be­fore Aug 16, and firms must con­tinue to meet the el­i­gi­bil­ity cri­te­ria for the 12-month pe­riod to re­ceive the full amount of sup­port.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has to re­main open to dif­fer­ent types of com­pa­nies in the tech­nol­ogy sec­tor, and their need to tap a di­verse tal­ent base, in­clud­ing for­eign work­ers, so as to en­sure good jobs for cit­i­zens, Min­is­ter for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion S. Iswaran told Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Our chal­lenge is to work with these com­pa­nies to con­tinue cre­at­ing ca­reer op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans, while recog­nis­ing that we must al­low them to have the nec­es­sary di­ver­sity in their tal­ent base, es­pe­cially in emerg­ing ar­eas, in or­der to strengthen our po­si­tion as a dig­i­tal tech hub,” he said.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing on the fifth and fi­nal day of de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress, and af­ter a num­ber of MPs had raised con­cerns about an un­der-rep­re­sen­ta­tion of Sin­ga­porean work­ers in some sec­tors or func­tions, the min­is­ter said the dig­i­tal econ­omy re­mained a “bright spot” for Sin­ga­porean job seek­ers.</p>
    <p>He noted the more than 18,000 jobs and skills op­por­tu­ni­ties in the sec­tor un­der the SGUnited Jobs and</p>
    <p>Skills Package, say­ing: “Our goal is to have as many skilled Sin­ga­pore­ans as pos­si­ble to take up these roles, and that is why we are scal­ing up our ef­forts, both in pre-em­ploy­ment and con­tin­u­ing ed­u­ca­tion.”</p>
    <p>The TechSkills Ac­cel­er­a­tor pro­gramme, which equips work­ers with dig­i­tal skills, has placed about 6,600 Sin­ga­pore­ans in tech jobs so far. And the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity is look­ing to place and train an ad­di­tional 5,500 Sin­ga­pore­ans in tech jobs over the next two to three years, he added.</p>
    <p>But in­creas­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans in the sec­tor means also hav­ing to take into ac­count its var­ie­gated land­scape, where firms have di­verse needs and there­fore dif­fer­ent staff profiles, he said.</p>
    <p>Tech gi­ants such as Google, Face­book and Ama­zon have re­gional head­quar­ters here, and hire many Sin­ga­pore­ans both here and abroad, he noted. But the na­ture of their busi­ness means they need a glob­ally di­verse tal­ent pool, and the pro­por­tion of lo­cals may not be as high as the na­tional av­er­age.</p>
    <p>Firms like Google and Twit­ter base their Asia-Pa­cific en­gi­neer­ing teams here, and re­quire highly skilled prod­uct man­agers and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence sci­en­tists, who are glob­ally scarce, he added. Google is also work­ing with the Gov­ern­ment to train up to 3,000 Sin­ga­pore­ans for roles in growth ar­eas like dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing and cloud tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal uni­corns like Grab and Sea started with and main­tain a Sin­ga­porean core, but with their rapid in­ter­na­tional ex­pan­sion, they too need a strong com­ple­ment of re­gional and global tal­ent to be able to com­pete, Mr Iswaran said, adding their wider reach al­lows their Sin­ga­porean em­ploy­ees to ven­ture over­seas and gain global ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>There are also large lo­cal en­ter­prises like Sing­tel, with a high pro­por­tion of lo­cals, but which in­creas­ingly seek out global tal­ent to com­ple­ment their Sin­ga­porean core as they grow abroad and branch into new ar­eas such as cy­ber­se­cu­rity and cloud-based ser­vices, he noted.</p>
    <p>Then there are IT ser­vices com­pa­nies, which play a key role in sup­port­ing other sec­tors, but where there is more that can and will be done to re­duce con­cen­tra­tion and over-reliance on for­eign man­power while strength­en­ing the pipe­line of jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans, he said.</p>
    <p>On sug­ges­tions from some MPs to off­shore some of these jobs, Mr Iswaran said that this is not straight­for­ward and the scope for re­mote work could work against Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He added: “Our ef­forts to em­brace open­ness must be matched by an equal, if not greater, ef­fort to achieve an eq­ui­table distri­bu­tion of the ben­e­fits and the ac­cess to op­por­tu­ni­ties, to pre­serve a sense of fair­ness.”</p>
    <p>Mr Iswaran noted that trust is key to strik­ing this bal­ance be­tween stay­ing open and in­clu­sive.</p>
    <p>“Our cit­i­zens must know that the lives and liveli­hoods of Sin­ga­pore­ans are al­ways our pri­or­ity, that we have their back. Equally, our in­ter­na­tional part­ners must know that we are not just fair-weather friends, that we have the po­lit­i­cal will to stay the course,” he said, adding that Par­lia­ment, too, has a duty to build this trust.</p>
    <p>“We have painstak­ingly built an open and in­clu­sive econ­omy that is able to cre­ate op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans by wel­com­ing com­pet­i­tive en­ter­prises and tal­ent. It is a pre­cious as­set that we must not squan­der.”</p>
