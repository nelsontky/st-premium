    <p>JAKARTA • The President of the world’s largest Mus­lim-ma­jor­ity na­tion, Mr Joko Wi­dodo, yes­ter­day called for In­done­sia not to rush the roll-out of vac­cines, cit­ing con­cerns over pub­lic aware­ness about whether they were halal.</p>
    <p>With more than 365,000 coro­n­avirus cases and over 12,000 deaths, In­done­sia has strug­gled to get its out­break un­der con­trol, and the gov­ern­ment has been rac­ing to se­cure a sup­ply of vac­cines while still un­der de­vel­op­ment, draw­ing crit­i­cism from some epi­demi­ol­o­gists for seek­ing a “sil­ver bul­let” so­lu­tion be­fore full vac­cine ef­fi­cacy and safety is known.</p>
    <p>Se­nior min­is­ters have in­di­cated that emer­gency vac­cine au­tho­ri­sa­tion could be granted as early as next month.</p>
    <p>But the President, bet­ter known by his moniker “Jokowi”, sig­nalled a more cau­tion­ary ap­proach, warn­ing against haste and urg­ing clear pub­lic mes­sag­ing about whether vac­cines were halal, or per­mis­si­ble un­der Is­lam.</p>
    <p>“I ask that this vac­cine is not rushed be­cause it is so com­plex,” Mr Joko said ahead of a closed meet­ing. “I want to en­sure there is good prepa­ra­tion. On pub­lic com­mu­ni­ca­tion, es­pe­cially in re­la­tion to halal and haram, the price and qual­ity.”</p>
    <p>In­done­sia has pre­vi­ously pledged to vac­ci­nate more than 100 mil­lion people next year, but Mr Joko said yes­ter­day that the scale of in­oc­u­la­tion in an archipelag­ic na­tion of 270 mil­lion would be uniquely chal­leng­ing.</p>
    <p>Con­tro­versy over whether vac­cines ad­here to Is­lamic prin­ci­ples has stymied pub­lic health re­sponses be­fore in In­done­sia, in­clud­ing in 2018, when the In­done­sian Ulema Coun­cil is­sued a fatwa declar­ing a measles vac­cine was haram, or for­bid­den un­der Is­lam.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia has made deals to se­cure 50 mil­lion doses from China’s Si­no­vac by March next year and 100 mil­lion from As­traZeneca by next April, in ad­di­tion to other deals.</p>
    <p>Vac­cines from Si­no­vac as well as China’s Sinopharm and CanSino Bi­o­log­ics for 9.1 mil­lion people will be avail­able this year, with health work­ers pri­ori­tised, said Dr Ach­mad Yurianto, a se­nior Health Min­istry of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia’s rush to se­cure sup­plies of un­proven vac­cines has gen­er­ated con­cern among epi­demi­ol­o­gists, some of whom ar­gue it should in­stead focus on test­ing and con­tact trac­ing until a safe and ef­fec­tive vac­cine is avail­able.</p>
    <p>“Many coun­tries think a vac­cine will be their sil­ver bul­let to deal with the pan­demic,” said Dr Dicky Budi­man, an In­done­sian epi­demi­ol­o­gist from Aus­tralia’s Grif­fith Univer­sity. “But, un­for­tu­nately, the his­tory of pan­demics, the lit­er­a­ture, does not sup­port that.”</p>
