    <p>What I lack in centre of grav­ity when­ever the MRT lurches, I make up for, sur­pris­ingly, in bal­anc­ing on skates.</p>
    <p>I credit this to my child­hood – much of it spent in rollerblad­es zip­ping up and down the road out­side my house. So when I en­ter retrotheme­d in­door skat­ing rink Hi Roller Sin­ga­pore, it is with ex­cite­ment and not trep­i­da­tion.</p>
    <p>I have roped in three girl­friends for an un­usual girls’ day out. Th­ese days, with­out the usual party av­enues or travel es­capes to de-stress from work, we have be­come yes-men to ac­tiv­i­ties we would not usu­ally have con­sid­ered. So have oth­ers, it seems. Ms Daphne Chua, co-owner of Hi Roller, says the rink has seen a surge in in­ter­est in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>Opened in March last year, it used to be fre­quented mostly by pro­fes­sional skaters as an in­door play­ground to prac­tise tricks and tech­niques.</p>
    <p>“Some­how, af­ter Covid-19, the retro vibe came back – and it</p>
    <p>at­tracted a lot of teenagers who wanted a feel of the 90s life­style,” says Ms Chua, 26. Now, the ma­jor­ity of its skaters are teens aged 20 and be­low.</p>
    <p>An­other un­ex­pected fac­tor: TikTok. Teens started post­ing videos of them­selves danc­ing and skat­ing at the rink on TikTok and “it be­came vi­ral”, she adds.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic en­try is in two-hour slots, with the rink and equip­ment dis­in­fected af­ter ev­ery ses­sion. Dur­ing week­ends, the rink’s peak pe­riod, the first slot is at 4.30pm, af­ter pri­vate lessons – when the lights are turned down and the mu­sic turned up. A few well-placed disco balls set the mood.</p>
    <p>Ms Chua says many have called it the clos­est thing to club­bing dur­ing Covid-19, and five min­utes in, I can see why. There are flash­ing lights, a mildly dis­ori­ent­ing fog and, of course, pound­ing dance tracks.</p>
    <p>But fret not, no sleaze­balls will of­fer to buy you a drink here.</p>
    <p>We agree that the playlist is great – a mix of main­stream pop as well as mu­sic from the 1980s and 1990s – nos­tal­gic enough for those in their 20s. Be­fore Covid-19, there was a DJ in the in­ner box of the rink to get the crowd hyped up.</p>
    <p>Choose your skate gear wisely. Rollerblad­es (with wheels in a row) are much easier to ma­noeu­vre in, even though roller skates bet­ter com­plete the retro aes­thetic.</p>
    <p>I nearly lose my bal­ance in roller skates in my first few at­tempts, but am de­ter­mined to get the au­then­tic roller skat­ing ex­pe­ri­ence and soon get the hang of it.</p>
    <p>The trick is to lean for­ward and keep go­ing so you do not lose mo­men­tum. If you have rollerblad­ing ex­pe­ri­ence, j ust keep try­ing and you will catch on quickly.</p>
    <p>Whizzing around is ex­hil­a­rat­ing, but the real fun comes in belt­ing out top hits with your pals – while on skates. We jive to Danc­ing In The Moon­light; YMCA; Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom!!; and Super Bass.</p>
    <p>Around us, friends and cou­ples do</p>
    <p>the same with glee­ful aban­don – it al­most feels like I am club­bing.</p>
    <p>Is this how my par­ents used to party and min­gle? I imag­ine a clas­sic “meet cute” scene, where girl loses her bal­ance and slams into boy, gig­gling as he prof­fers his arm to es­cort her for an­other lap around the rink.</p>
    <p>My com­pan­ion sug­gests the rink should sell shots, but that sounds like a recipe for dis­as­ter. Drinks would also rule out the teenage clien­tele.</p>
    <p>The place fills up quickly with young’uns dressed more for self­ies than skat­ing. With a cur­rent limit of 50 peo­ple in the rink at one time, book­ings are rec­om­mended at least three days in ad­vance.</p>
    <p>Other things re­mind me of a club too – how you have to skil­fully dodge peo­ple obliv­i­ous to their sur­round­ings and how you end up drenched in sweat.</p>
    <p>Knack­ered af­ter an hour, we call it a day at 5.30pm.</p>
    <p>I can­not help but think back to how we used to call it a night at 5.30am in the club – funny how things change.</p>
    <p>Pro tip: Wear jeans or trousers. The chances of you face-plant­ing are low, but be­ing cov­ered lends a sense of se­cu­rity when peo­ple are zip­ping at high speed around you.</p>
