    <p>The former pres­i­dent of Seran­goon Gar­dens Coun­try Club who sued a former em­ployee and her su­per­vi­sor for defama­tion, af­ter she filed a work complaint against him, has lost his case in the High Court.</p>
    <p>Mr Ter­rence Fer­nan­dez al­leged that Ms Genevieve Lim Shao Ying, who was the club’s mem­ber­ship re­la­tions man­ager, had con­spired with Mr Goh Juak Kin, who was the gen­eral man­ager, to in­jure him.</p>
    <p>In a writ­ten judg­ment on Wed­nes­day, High Court judge Va­lerie Thean re­jected Mr Fer­nan­dez’s as­ser­tion that the complaint was defam­a­tory. Jus­tice Thean said a work­place complaint “nec­es­sar­ily en­tails levy­ing allegation­s”.</p>
    <p>“The or­di­nary rea­son­able per­son would have un­der­stood the complaint to be part of a larger dis­ci­plinary frame­work. The truth of Ms Lim’s allegation­s would, in other words, be un­set­tled un­til due process has been ac­corded to it,” said the judge.</p>
    <p>The judge found that Ms Lim filed the complaint not out of mal­ice, but to pro­tect her­self against what she per­ceived as work­place ha­rass­ment and vic­tim­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Thean added that Ms Lim’s state­ments were jus­ti­fied be­cause Mr Fer­nan­dez’s acts of mi­cro­man­age­ment led her to feel vic­timised.</p>
    <p>The case arose out of a for­mal complaint against Mr Fer­nan­dez made by Ms Lim in 2018.</p>
    <p>At the time, he was chair­man of the club’s mem­ber­ship re­la­tions depart­ment sub-com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim, who headed the depart­ment, did not have a good work­ing re­la­tion­ship with him.</p>
    <p>Within three weeks of start­ing work in Jan­uary 2017, she told hu­man re­source man­ager Linda Loke that she felt “tremen­dous work pres­sure” and sought con­fir­ma­tion that she re­ported to Mr Goh rather than Mr Fer­nan­dez.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim went on to dis­cuss her griev­ances with Ms Loke seven times over three months.</p>
    <p>In April 2017, Ms Lim wrote to Mr Goh, crit­i­cis­ing Mr Fer­nan­dez’s “dam­ag­ing and dis­rup­tive be­hav­iour”. She al­leged that work­ing with him had been “painful” and, on sev­eral oc­ca­sions, “be­lit­tling”.</p>
    <p>De­spite a me­di­a­tion ses­sion ar­ranged by then club pres­i­dent Randy Sng, their re­la­tion­ship re­mained strained.</p>
    <p>Things came to a head on Dec 8, 2017, when Ms Lim told a non­mem­ber named Al­fred Wong that he should not be on club premises. Later that day, Mr Wong wrote to Mr Goh about his “un­pleas­ant en­counter”. Mr Fer­nan­dez learnt of the in­ci­dent from Mr Wong and raised con­cerns about the mat­ter in e-mail cor­re­spon­dence with Mr Goh, which was copied to Ms Lim and Mr Sng. The mat­ter with Mr Wong was re­solved am­i­ca­bly on Dec 26, 2017. But Mr Fer­nan­dez con­tin­ued to pur­sue the mat­ter and pro­posed a meet­ing in­volv­ing the club’s trus­tees or pa­trons.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim filed a complaint on Jan 4, 2018, and Mr Goh for­warded it, to­gether with his own views, to Mr Sng. Mr Sng tried to set up a meet­ing but Mr Fer­nan­dez did not at­tend, de­spite mul­ti­ple at­tempts to ac­com­mo­date his sched­ule.</p>
    <p>On Jan 30, 2018, Mr Fer­nan­dez was re­moved as chair­man of the sub-com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>A dis­ci­plinary in­quiry was started against him but be­fore it could con­clude, he was elected club pres­i­dent on June 24, 2018.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh and Ms Loke re­signed that day, while Ms Lim re­signed the fol­low­ing month.</p>
    <p>The dis­ci­plinary charges against Mr Fer­nan­dez were later dis­missed. He sued Ms Lim and Mr Goh in Fe­bru­ary 2019, claim­ing they were in a con­spir­acy to sab­o­tage his bid for club pres­i­dency, among other things.</p>
    <p>Mr Fer­nan­dez is no longer club pres­i­dent, as a new gen­eral com­mit­tee was voted into of­fice in Septem­ber last year.</p>
