    <p>Commuters will soon be able to share in­spir­ing sto­ries of care that they have wit­nessed or re­ceived dur­ing their com­mute, on an on­line por­tal that will be launched next month.</p>
    <p>The por­tal, which is one in a se­ries of new ini­tia­tives by the Car­ing SG Commuters Com­mit­tee, will also al­low more ef­fec­tive en­gage­ment with commuters on how to shape an in­clu­sive, car­ing and gra­cious com­mut­ing cul­ture.</p>
    <p>This new move was an­nounced at a vir­tual event held yes­ter­day for the un­veil­ing of an ap­pre­ci­a­tion wall at Kent Ridge MRT sta­tion.</p>
    <p>The wall, which was cre­ated by stu­dents from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Stu­dents’ Union (Nussu) in part­ner­ship with the Car­ing SG Commuters Com­mit­tee, will give commuters an op­por­tu­nity to pen mes­sages of ap­pre­ci­a­tion to front-line work­ers in the fight against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s vir­tual event was at­tended by Min­is­ter for Trans­port Ong Ye Kung, pub­lic trans­port work­ers and staff from the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal (NUH), as well as stu­dents rep­re­sent­ing Nussu.</p>
    <p>Mr Shaun Tan, in­ter­nal vice-pres­i­dent of Nussu, said: “We wanted to work with the Pub­lic Trans­port Coun­cil to see how we can cre­ate this car­ing cul­ture... A pub­lic ap­pre­ci­a­tion wall is ac­tu­ally a very spe­cial part of Nussu’s his­tory as we had a very sim­i­lar ini­tia­tive dur­ing the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome (Sars) out­break.”</p>
    <p>Ms Grace Ting, a se­nior staff nurse from NUH, praised the ap­pre­ci­a­tion wall ini­tia­tive and said: “Pub­lic trans­port is not only for an in­di­vid­ual to get from work to home, but also for every­one to cre­ate an in­clu­sive so­ci­ety where even the el­derly and hand­i­capped are able to travel to their de­sired des­ti­na­tion.”</p>
    <p>Other new ini­tia­tives by the Car­ing SG Commuters Com­mit­tee, which was formed in Jan­uary, in­clude a video cam­paign that will be launched next month to raise aware­ness of the chal­lenges faced by commuters with spe­cial needs and the fel­low commuters who help them.</p>
    <p>Through a se­ries of short films based on real life ex­pe­ri­ences, the com­mit­tee hopes to build a sense of em­pa­thy and show­case ev­ery­day heroes. The video se­ries will be rolled out monthly on the on­line por­tal as well as on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic can fol­low the Car­ing SG Commuters Face­book and In­sta­gram pages to stay up­dated on the launch of the on­line por­tal and video se­ries.</p>
    <p>The com­mit­tee also con­tin­ues to work with pub­lic trans­port op­er­a­tors on an on­go­ing pi­lot pro­gramme, where commuters with in­vis­i­ble med­i­cal con­di­tions can ob­tain a spe­cial sticker to alert fel­low commuters that they re­quire a seat.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said: “We live in dif­fi­cult times with Covid-19 and in these times... But I think we can al­ways fall back on the kind­ness and the help of our fel­low Sin­ga­pore­ans, and our family and friends around us. And this has been a source of strength for all of us.”</p>
    <p>The com­mit­tee will also or­gan­ise the an­nual Car­ing Com­muter Award in recog­ni­tion and cel­e­bra­tion of ev­ery­day heroes on pub­lic trans­port. Nom­i­na­tions for the awards are now open and can be sub­mit­ted on­line at go.gov.sg/car­ing­com­muter2020</p>
