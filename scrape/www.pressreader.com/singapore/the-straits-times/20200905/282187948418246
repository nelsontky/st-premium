    <p>From July to the mid­dle of last month, only 0.03 per cent of pa­tients aged 13 and above tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 af­ter be­ing di­ag­nosed with acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion at clin­ics.</p>
    <p>This “small per­cent­age” of pa­tients at poly­clin­ics and Pub­lic Health Pre­pared­ness Clin­ics (PHPC) in­di­cates that the preva­lence of Covid-19 in the com­mu­nity is low, said Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Since July, pa­tients aged 13 and above who show up at poly­clin­ics and PHPCs with signs of acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion (ARI) have been tested for the coro­n­avirus, as part of mea­sures to stem the Covid-19 spread here.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan said in a writ­ten re­ply that early test­ing of all in­di­vid­u­als di­ag­nosed with ARI al­lows his min­istry to quickly de­tect in­fected in­di­vid­u­als and con­tain fur­ther spread.</p>
    <p>He noted that sci­en­tific ev­i­dence shows an in­fected per­son is most in­fec­tious right be­fore and im­me­di­ately af­ter the start of symp­toms.</p>
    <p>He added that the Min­istry of Health (MOH) con­tin­ues to en­cour­age all in­di­vid­u­als who are un­well to seek med­i­cal at­ten­tion im­me­di­ately and fol­low med­i­cal advice.</p>
    <p>Be­sides ARI pa­tients, the min­istry also tests other groups that are more vul­ner­a­ble or have a higher risk of ex­po­sure, as part of its strat­egy.</p>
    <p>These in­clude work­ers in dor­mi­to­ries, those in the con­struc­tion, marine and process sec­tors and work­ers sup­port­ing front-line Covid-19 op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan said that cur­rently, more than 200,000 such in­di­vid­u­als are tested ev­ery two weeks.</p>
    <p>In the last two-week cy­cle, about 200 of such in­di­vid­u­als tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, he said, adding that a ma­jor­ity of these cases are likely to be from past in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>On the turn­around time of Covid-19 test re­sults, Mr Gan said the cur­rent mean time from when a pa­tient is swabbed till the lab­o­ra­to­ries make test re­sults avail­able is 30 hours. The me­dian time is 22 hours.</p>
    <p>“Agen­cies and pri­vate providers sup­port­ing the test­ing op­er­a­tions en­deav­our to turn around the test re­sults as soon as pos­si­ble,” he said, adding that con­firmed cases will be quickly no­ti­fied for the “nec­es­sary pub­lic health ac­tions to be taken”.</p>
