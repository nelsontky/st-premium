    <p>A STUDY con­ducted by the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity Lien Cen­tre for So­cial In­no­va­tion</p>
    <p>About one in 10 Sin­ga­pore­ans strug­gled to get suf­fi­cient, safe and nu­tri­tious food at least once in the last 12 months, a study has found.</p>
    <p>Of this 10.4 per cent, two out of five house­holds strug­gled to get such food at least once a month.</p>
    <p>The study also found that these fam­i­lies were more likely to be liv­ing in one- or two-room Hous­ing Board flats.</p>
    <p>About 1,200 homes took part in the study, which was con­ducted be­tween July and De­cem­ber last year by re­searchers from the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity (SMU) Lien Cen­tre for So­cial In­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>The aim of the study was to find out the preva­lence, causes and con­se­quences of what is called “food in­se­cu­rity”.</p>
    <p>Com­mis­sioned by food char­ity Food Bank Sin­ga­pore, the study was ti­tled The Hunger Re­port: An In-depth Look At Food In­se­cu­rity In Sin­ga­pore, and its find­ings were re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>SMU re­searchers con­ducted a sim­i­lar study in 2018 but on a smaller scale, with 236 low-in­come fam­i­lies tak­ing part.</p>
    <p>The lat­est study – helmed by Dr</p>
    <p>Ta­nia Nag­paul, Dr Dalvin Sidhu and Ms Jin­wen Chen – found that the heads of food-in­se­cure fam­i­lies tended to have lower ed­u­ca­tional qual­i­fi­ca­tions, and were much less likely to have com­pleted univer­sity.</p>
    <p>It said: “This re­port re­it­er­ates that in­come is a per­sis­tent fac­tor in food in­se­cu­rity, with 79 per cent of the rea­sons cited for food in­se­cu­rity be­ing cen­tred on fi­nan­cial con­straints.”</p>
    <p>Other rea­sons in­cluded time con­straints, re­stricted mo­bil­ity, in­car­cer­a­tion, spouse be­reave­ment and fam­ily break­down.</p>
    <p>The study also found that only 22 per cent of food-in­se­cure house­holds were re­ceiv­ing food sup­port at the time of the sur­vey. About 62 per cent of food-in­se­cure house­holds did not seek food sup­port.</p>
    <p>The rea­sons cited in­cluded em­bar­rass­ment, be­ing un­aware of avail­able food sup­port and the be­lief that oth­ers needed it more than them.</p>
    <p>The study said: “There was sig­nif­i­cant dis­en­chant­ment with food sup­port, per­haps be­cause food as­sis­tance can­not be a long-term so­lu­tion to food in­se­cu­rity if the root cause is in­come-re­lated.”</p>
    <p>An­other find­ing was that those who were food-in­se­cure were more likely to be in the high-risk body mass in­dex (BMI) cat­e­gory, and more likely to re­port neg­a­tive emo­tions, in­di­cat­ing neg­a­tive ef­fects both phys­i­cally and men­tally.</p>
    <p>The au­thors made sev­eral rec­om­men­da­tions to ad­dress the is­sue be­cause the per­cent­age of house­holds that are food-in­se­cure can­not be over­looked, they said.</p>
    <p>To boost food sup­port, they sug­gested more strate­gic co­or­di­na­tion in pro­vid­ing food sup­port to fam­i­lies that need it. “Ge­o­graph­i­cal map­ping of ar­eas where vul­ner­a­ble house­holds re­side can aid in iden­ti­fy­ing food-in­se­cure neigh­bour­hoods and in­form­ing food aid or­gan­i­sa­tions.”</p>
    <p>At the na­tional level, there can be more strate­gic co­or­di­na­tion of food sup­port in­volv­ing multi-sec­tor part­ner­ships be­tween the Gov­ern­ment, non-profit and pri­vate sec­tors, it added.</p>
    <p>The re­port also sug­gested that more em­pha­sis be placed on nu­tri­tious and healthy eat­ing, as only 40 per cent of re­spon­dents had a healthy BMI, re­gard­less of food se­cu­rity sta­tus. It also called for more in­for­ma­tion and ed­u­ca­tion on food in­se­cu­rity in Sin­ga­pore, so that there is more em­pa­thy and aware­ness about the is­sue.</p>
    <p>The study noted that some of its rec­om­men­da­tions have al­ready been ad­dressed through the on­go­ing ef­forts of the Char­ity Food Work­group, which was con­vened by the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment (MSF) last year.</p>
    <p>The work­group com­prises food char­i­ties, busi­nesses and gov­ern­ment agen­cies, and is meant to be a plat­form for the ex­change of ideas and prac­tices, and a means to forge part­ner­ships.</p>
    <p>An MSF spokesman, in a state­ment yes­ter­day, said the min­istry had worked with the re­searchers of the study to im­prove their method­ol­ogy and ob­tain a more na­tion­ally rep­re­sen­ta­tive sur­vey sam­ple.</p>
    <p>“The re­port is a com­mend­able ef­fort that delves deeper into the state of food in­se­cu­rity in Sin­ga­pore, as we col­lec­tively press on to build a car­ing and in­clu­sive so­ci­ety, and sup­port those in our com­mu­nity with greater needs,” she said.</p>
    <p>She added that the work­group is cur­rently work­ing on two ini­tia­tives to en­able bet­ter co­or­di­na­tion of food sup­port. It is de­vel­op­ing a data­base of food sup­port re­cip­i­ents and also test­ing out lo­cal food sup­port co­or­di­na­tors who will over­see the needs and sup­port dis­tri­bu­tion for res­i­dents, start­ing with a few towns in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
