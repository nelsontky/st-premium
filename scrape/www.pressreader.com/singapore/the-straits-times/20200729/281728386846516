    <p>On Feb 4, Sin­ga­pore saw its first lo­cally trans­mit­ted case of Covid-19, and the def­i­ni­tion of sus­pect cases was changed.</p>
    <p>Within a day, a surge of nearly 500 peo­ple – al­most double the usual num­ber – be­gan show­ing up at the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Diseases’ (NCID) screen­ing cen­tre, pos­ing a risk of over­crowd­ing.</p>
    <p>But in­stead of be­ing over­whelmed, the cen­tre was able to quickly open an­other hun­dred beds for pa­tients and safely man­age the crowd flow, thanks to a newly launched com­mand, con­trol and com­mu­ni­ca­tions (C3) sys­tem at the nearby Tan Tock Seng Hospi­tal (TTSH).</p>
    <p>The sys­tem won the Ex­cel­lence Cham­pion Medal at this year’s Na­tional Health­care In­no­va­tion and Pro­duc­tiv­ity awards by the Min­istry of Health.</p>
    <p>Dr Jamie Mervyn Lim, chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer of TTSH and Cen­tral</p>
    <p>Health, told re­porters on Mon­day that up till 2008, TTSH had re­lied on a “pen, pa­per and phone” sys­tem of man­ag­ing its oper­a­tions, with each depart­ment do­ing its own thing.</p>
    <p>“It was very in­ef­fi­cient, we weren’t able to op­ti­mise the process be­cause there was no vis­i­bil­ity about where empty beds were, who was dis­charged, and so on,” he said.</p>
    <p>But fol­low­ing the suc­cess­ful use of tech­nol­ogy such as ra­dio fre­quency iden­ti­fi­ca­tion chips and com­puter al­go­rithms in the hospi­tal in the fol­low­ing years, the de­ci­sion was made in 2015 to try to lever­age tech­nol­ogy fur­ther to sup­port de­ci­sion-mak­ing and en­hance the hospi­tal’s work­flows.</p>
    <p>So, the C3 sys­tem was launched in De­cem­ber last year. Lo­cated in the TTSH Oper­a­tions Com­mand Cen­tre, it serves as the “brain” to both TTSH and NCID, help­ing to con­trol the flow of re­sources across both in­sti­tu­tions, which share the same pool of man­power.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem gives a team of about a dozen staff in the cen­tre a bird’s eye view of ev­ery­thing that is go­ing on in TTSH and NCID – from crowds form­ing at po­ten­tial choke­points to which rooms are about to be va­cated so that house­keep­ing staff can quickly pre­pare them for the next pa­tient.</p>
    <p>“There is a lot of back-end co­or­di­na­tion, and the (C3 sys­tem) pro­vides that level of vis­i­bil­ity of where the dif­fer­ent re­sources are, who we can ac­ti­vate and how quickly, and lets us de­ploy them,” said Dr Lim.</p>
    <p>The C3 sys­tem, which was co-de­vel­oped by TTSH, In­te­grated Health In­for­ma­tion Sys­tems and ST En­gi­neer­ing, and sup­ported by the Health Min­istry, also comes with mul­ti­ple pre-planned sce­nario modes which al­low it to adapt to var­i­ous real-life sit­u­a­tions, such as a civil emer­gency, an in­fec­tious dis­ease out­break or a fire in the hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>Dr Lim said the sys­tem has helped TTSH and NCID deal with the dif­fi­cul­ties posed by the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>“When you go i nto out­break mode, you are go­ing into an un­known... We needed more data points,” he said.</p>
    <p>Us­ing de­vices known as re­al­time lo­ca­tion track­ers, the C3 sys­tem helps pro­vide data about staff and pa­tient move­ment, al­low­ing the i nsti­tu­tions to track who Covid-19 pa­tients may have come into con­tact with.</p>
    <p>It also keeps track of how many gloves and masks have been used each day, which en­ables the in­sti­tu­tions to an­tic­i­pate and plug any short­ages long be­fore they arise.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem also helps to quickly as­sign the best beds to pa­tients, sort­ing quickly through around 300 con­sid­er­a­tions such as gen­der, ward class pref­er­ence and ill­ness – some­thing that had to be done man­u­ally in the past.</p>
    <p>Dr Lim said the sys­tem is con­tin­u­ally be­ing adapted and up­graded, with the even­tual aim of link­ing it to other part­ners in the health­care net­work, such as com­mu­nity hos­pi­tals, am­bu­lance ser­vice providers, poly­clin­ics and other public hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>“No two out­breaks are the same, and we co-de­vel­oped the out­break mod­ule as Covid-19 evolves.</p>
    <p>“We learnt along the way, and we have to be nim­ble enough to adapt with each step of the jour­ney,” he said.</p>
