    <p>LON­DON • Chelsea are set to smash their trans­fer spend­ing record for a sin­gle win­dow as Kai Havertz and Thi­ago Silva are ex­pected to fol­low Ben Chilwell in ar­riv­ing at Stam­ford Bridge.</p>
    <p>Eng­land left-back Chilwell be­came Chelsea’s third high-pro­file sign­ing of the sum­mer on Wed­nes­day, leav­ing Le­ices­ter City for a fee re­ported to be around £50 mil­lion (S$90 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>His five-year deal – re­port­edly worth £190,000 a week, three times his wages at Le­ices­ter – makes him the sec­ond-most ex­pen­sive English full-back be­hind Kyle Walker, who j oined Manch­ester City from Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur for £53 mil­lion in 2017.</p>
    <p>“I am de­lighted to be join­ing Chelsea at this very ex­cit­ing time for the club,” the 23-year-old Chilwell, who has 11 Eng­land caps, said on the club’s web­site.</p>
    <p>“I’m look­ing for­ward to be­ing a part of this young, dy­namic squad led by Frank Lam­pard as we chal­lenge for hon­ours next sea­son.”</p>
    <p>Chelsea’s sum­mer spend­ing has gone past £134 mil­lion af­ter the ear­lier ar­rivals of Hakim Ziyech, 27, and Timo Werner, 24, from Ajax and RB Leipzig re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Silva is set to be next, with the Brazil in­ter­na­tional due to un­dergo a med­i­cal test in Mi­lan yes­ter­day, re­ported Sky Sports. The free agent and Chilwell are tasked with bol­ster­ing a de­fence which con­ceded 54 Premier League goals last sea­son – the most among clubs in the top half of the ta­ble.</p>
    <p>Silva, who will turn 36 next month, will join on a 12-month con­tract, with an op­tion to stay for a fur­ther sea­son. A starter in the Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal de­feat by Bay­ern Mu­nich, he said farewell to Paris Saint-Ger­main fans on so­cial me­dia on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“Today a cy­cle ends, af­ter eight years with the PSG team I would like to thank my team­mates, the whole tech­ni­cal team and man­age­ment, the fans, my fam­ily, God and friends, for all th­ese happy mo­ments we ex­pe­ri­enced in the city of light,” said the seven-time Ligue One win­ner.</p>
    <p>Chelsea have also re­port­edly agreed a fee of up to £90 mil­lion for Bayer Lev­erkusen mid­fielder Havertz, 21, with a deal ex­pected to be com­pleted this week­end.</p>
    <p>The Blues spent a then clu­brecord £200 mil­lion in the sum­mer of 2017 that was ex­ceeded by their 2017-18 to­tal of £234 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Lam­pard’s splurge will mean that the Chelsea great will be un­der more pres­sure to de­liver in his sec­ond sea­son in charge. He led them to a top-four fin­ish last sea­son.</p>
    <p>But their prepa­ra­tions for the new cam­paign – start­ing against Brighton on Sept 14 – have been thrown into dis­ar­ray af­ter sev­eral play­ers tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 ahead of pre-sea­son train­ing.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to re­ports, at l east eight play­ers are in quar­an­tine, with Ma­son Mount, Tammy Abra­ham, Jorginho, Chris­tian Pulisic, Ross Barkley and Fikayo To­mori among the first-team play­ers af­fected.</p>
    <p>Play­ers with the dis­ease have to self-iso­late for 10 days and re­turn a neg­a­tive test be­fore they can take part in train­ing.</p>
