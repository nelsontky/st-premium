    <p>First the good news. Trafal­gar Tours has re­alised that there is do­mes­tic de­mand for its her­itage tours and is now of­fer­ing stand­alone day tours which are not tied to a pricey ho­tel stay. In ad­di­tion to of­fer­ing its Victoria Clock Tower climb as a day tour, it is in­tro­duc­ing a new Cross­roads Alive! walk.</p>
    <p>The three-hour ex­pe­ri­ence, which in­cludes lunch at the Prac­tice Tuck­shop and is priced at $228 a per­son, takes in the Water­loo Street area, fo­cus­ing on its arts and her­itage as­pects.</p>
    <p>The bad news: Hav­ing lived one street over for more than a decade, I am a tough cus­tomer for this jaunt around the Si Beh Lor area, which I found lack­ing in depth and de­tail.</p>
    <p>Four Horse Road, the di­rect trans­la­tion of the Hokkien term, is what older gen­er­a­tions still call Water­loo Street. The name dates from a time when Sin­ga­pore had few main roads and they were named numer­i­cally by lo­cals less con­ver­sant with English.</p>
    <p>This tid­bit was shared by Toh Thiam Wei, the en­thu­si­as­tic tour guide and founder of Indie Sin­ga­pore Tours.</p>
    <p>Water­loo Street is one of my favourite ar­eas of Sin­ga­pore. It is a his­toric street where tra­di­tional houses of wor­ship sit cheek by jowl with hip­ster cafes, where homey Hous­ing Board flats nudge up against swanky new de­vel­op­ments, where the youth­ful vibe of arts and ter­tiary stu­dents bump up against the leisurely pace of se­nior cit­i­zens who throng the area for shop­ping and wor­ship.</p>
    <p>De­spite the fact that it is in town, pock­ets of the area still pos­sess a slightly sleepy air on week­days. And on fes­tive oc­ca­sions, stretches of it burst with life and colour.</p>
    <p>As one of the few streets still re­plete with his­tor­i­cal rem­nants in the form of con­served build­ings, Water­loo Street is the per­fect set­ting for a walk through his­tory. This is a rich well which The The­atre Prac­tice, Trafal­gar’s part­ner for this tour, has plumbed for artis­tic in­spi­ra­tion in its Four Horse Road the­atre prom­e­nade piece.</p>
    <p>For the ca­sual do­mes­tic tourist, this eas­ily paced walk is a gen­tle re­minder of Sin­ga­pore’s mul­ti­cul­tur­al­ism which Sin­ga­pore­ans tend to take for granted.</p>
    <p>The start­ing point it­self is a demon­stra­tion of this. The­atre Prac­tice’s home is spread over three con­served build­ings, once hous­ing two Chi­nese-owned homes which sand­wiched a Mus­lim-owned res­i­dence. Lo­cated next door is the Maghain Aboth Syn­a­gogue, the old­est syn­a­gogue in South-east Asia built in 1878, and across the street is the Church of Saints Peter and Paul.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther down Water­loo Street, there is the for­mer Methodist Church, which once held Malay ser­vices and then across Mid­dle Road, the Sri Kr­ish­nan Tem­ple and the Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Tem­ple.</p>
    <p>The tour is tai­lored for peo­ple with just a pass­ing knowl­edge of the area be­cause lit­tle of the in­for­ma­tion I glean is new to me. Still, younger par­tic­i­pants are in­trigued by the in­for­ma­tion that Bugis Street was once the haunt of trans­ves­tites and for­eign sailors, and that the build­ing hous­ing de­signer fur­ni­ture shop Space was pre­vi­ously oc­cu­pied by a dodgy karaoke joint named Cleopa­tra.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing moved into the neigh­bour­hood in the mid-2000s and wit­nessed the area’s gen­tri­fi­ca­tion, I can also add that where V Ho­tel now stands was once the mar­vel­lously seedy Peony Man­sion, ten­anted by la­dy­boys and ladies of the night who fu­elled the busi­ness of the de­li­cious Viet­namese and Thai food stalls in the 24-hour cof­feeshop on its ground floor.</p>
    <p>Wei, how­ever, is stu­diously cir­cum­spect about the more colour­ful as­pects of the neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>While wan­der­ing through the Stam­ford Arts Cen­tre, he men­tions that it used to be a Ja­panese school and notes that there was a thriv­ing Ja­panese com­mu­nity here be­fore World War II.</p>
    <p>But he ne­glects to men­tion the Bugis area also housed many Ja­panese broth­els staffed by karayuki san (women who went south) and there were spies in the com­mu­nity too in the pre-war era.</p>
    <p>He did how­ever pay trib­ute to the Bugis peo­ple who were the first oc­cu­pants of the district that still bears their name. He also sug­gested that their tol­er­ant be­lief sys­tem, which recog­nised up to five gen­ders, might ex­plain why the early LGBTQ com­mu­nity con­gre­gated here, re­sult­ing in the area’s later as­so­ci­a­tion with trans­ves­tite sex work­ers.</p>
    <p>The tour ends back at the Prac­tice Tuck­shop where par­tic­i­pants can savour a lunch of noo­dles paired with a lovely tea blended by tea mer­chant Pek Sin Choon.</p>
    <p>For lo­cals who rarely ven­ture into a the­atre, this part is an easy in­tro­duc­tion to Sin­ga­pore’s rich the­atre scene as a The­atre Prac­tice rep­re­sen­ta­tive talks about the 55-year-old bilin­gual troupe’s his­tory as well as its Re­cess Time pro­gramme which aims to raise aware­ness about food waste.</p>
    <p>Judg­ing from the re­ac­tions of other tour par­tic­i­pants, who were ev­i­dently un­fa­mil­iar with the area and Sin­ga­pore’s arts scene, the tour of­fered a fresh per­spec­tive. A walk through a colour­ful neigh­bour­hood cer­tainly beats a his­tory book any time in mak­ing his­tory come to life.</p>
