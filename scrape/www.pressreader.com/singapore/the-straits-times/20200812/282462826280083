    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • It looks like singer Ja­son Derulo re­cently knocked Will Smith’s teeth out – but not over a se­ri­ous spat or sig­nif­i­cant scuf­fle, but over a ge­nial game of golf, CNN re­ports.</p>
    <p>The two had met up over the week­end so that Smith, 51, could teach Derulo, 30, the game. How­ever, they were not able to get very far in the les­son. In­struct­ing Derulo on his stance and swing, Smith had un­ex­pect­edly got a mouth­ful of golf club, say­ing good­bye to three of his front teeth.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor posted a video of the in­ci­dent on In­sta­gram and TikTok on Sun­day. Show­ing the cam­era his chipped teeth, the ac­tor cap­tioned, “And we never saw @ja­son­derulo again.”</p>
    <p>The Whatcha Say singer re­sponded: “I know a good den­tist,” be­fore con­tin­u­ing plead­ingly, “...text me back.”</p>
    <p>The duo took an­other we­fie, with the Aladdin ac­tor proudly show­ing off his chipped teeth in a grin. He cap­tioned, “I gotta stop invit­ing @ja­son­derulo over.”</p>
    <p>Derulo posted the same photo on his In­sta­gram, cap­tion­ing, “He’s fi­nally em­brac­ing his new smile.”</p>
    <p>While ne­ti­zens still are un­sure as to whether the in­ci­dent is a prank, peo­ple have been send­ing get-well­soon wishes to Smith, while oth­ers could not help but join in the rib­bing.</p>
    <p>One com­mented: “Freth prince of be­lair,” a ref­er­ence to sit­com, The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air (1990-1996), which Smith starred in.</p>
