    <p>Given the high cost of car own­er­ship, the ques­tion of whether cars are worth their high price tags in Sin­ga­pore is a peren­nial de­bate.</p>
    <p>Now, this ques­tion is even more per­ti­nent as the Covid-19 pan­demic bat­ters the econ­omy and con­sumers tighten their bud­gets.</p>
    <p>How­ever, some drivers, like those with young chil­dren, still see cars as a ne­ces­sity. And cri­te­ria such as prac­ti­cal­ity, util­ity and value be­come all the more im­por­tant for these buy­ers of en­try-level cars.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese and South Kore­ans used to cor­ner this mar­ket seg­ment, but Span­ish brand Seat now pro­vides a con­ti­nen­tal op­tion.</p>
    <p>The diesel-pow­ered Toledo was first launched in 2016 be­fore a petrol vari­ant re­placed it two years later.</p>
    <p>The Toledo ex­udes a quiet el­e­gance with its clean-cut lines and stat­uesque de­sign.</p>
    <p>How­ever, its halo­gen head­lights and 15-inch wheels seem a tad dated and small by to­day’s stan­dards, tak­ing some shine off its oth­er­wise un­der­stated good looks.</p>
    <p>With a wheel­base of 2,602mm, the sedan is nearly 100mm shorter than its ri­vals, such as the Toy­ota Corolla Altis and the Kia Cer­ato.</p>
    <p>Yet, it has a sur­pris­ingly spa­cious cabin with plenty of legroom that en­sures a com­fort­able jour­ney for four tall adults.</p>
    <p>Un­like its Asian com­peti­tors, the Toledo’s in­te­rior comes with fab­ric seats that can be up­graded to leather ones.</p>
    <p>The cock­pit is neatly laid out, with a 6.5-inch, full-colour touch­screen in­fo­tain­ment sys­tem that of­fers SD card, USB, Bluetooth, Aux-in and iPod con­nec­tions.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple Carplay, An­droid Auto and the re­verse cam­era, which are im­por­tant for some drivers, do not come as stan­dard fea­tures, but are avail­able as up­grades.</p>
    <p>Com­par­a­tively, the cock­pit of the Cer­ato packs more fea­tures. For in­stance, it has a larger eight-inch in­fo­tain­ment touch­screen. The Corolla Altis also has a snazz­ier fu­tur­is­tic dash­board.</p>
    <p>Still, the Toledo has some pleas­ant sur­prises on the in­side.</p>
    <p>Its glove box comes with an air vent, which lets i n the air­con­di­tion­ing, turn­ing the stor­age com­part­ment into a makeshift fridge to chill your drinks.</p>
    <p>Other nice touches in­clude an anti-daz­zle rear-view mir­ror and USB charg­ing ports for the rear pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>Boot space comes at a whop­ping 550 litres, which trumps the 502 litres of­fered by the Cer­ato and the Altis’ 470 litres.</p>
    <p>The fast­back tail­gate of the Toledo also al­lows for bulkier items to be stowed with ease. How­ever, more care must be taken to en­sure the tail­gate does not hit the ceil­ing when park­ing in con­fined spa­ces.</p>
    <p>The drive is also an area where the Toledo ex­cels.</p>
    <p>Churn­ing out 123bhp and 200Nm through a 1.4-litre tur­bocharged en­gine, which is mated to a silkys­mooth seven-speed dual-clutch gear­box, the car clocks the cen­tury sprint in nine sec­onds flat, leav­ing its Asian com­peti­tors in the dust.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily car is no sports sedan, but han­dles well enough for a daily drive.</p>
    <p>Save for a few bumpy mo­ments in the ru­ral Neo Tiew area, the sus­pen­sion pro­vides a set­tled ride when driven sen­si­bly.</p>
    <p>Safety-con­scious drivers will be pleased with its wide range of safety fea­tures, such as six airbags, a sys­tem which recog­nises and warns a fa­tigued driver, and ad­vanced brak­ing sys­tems that in­crease brak­ing pres­sure dur­ing an emer­gency and au­to­mat­i­cally brake upon im­pact to pre­vent mul­ti­ple col­li­sions These helped the car clinch the five-star Euro NCAP safety rat­ing.</p>
    <p>A de­cent fuel econ­omy of 7.9 litres/100km is achieved with a heavy right foot dur­ing a mix of city and high­way driv­ing.</p>
    <p>With prices start­ing at $79,999, the rel­a­tively se­date Toledo is some $10,000 to $20,000 cheaper than the fea­ture-packed top vari­ants of the Cer­ato and the Corolla Altis.</p>
    <p>The Asian mar­ques also en­joy bet­ter brand recog­ni­tion and a strong rep­u­ta­tion for re­li­a­bil­ity in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>But Seat is no young up­start. It has reached its 70th-an­niver­sary mile­stone this year and the Toledo – whose fourth gen­er­a­tion is cur­rently avail­able in Sin­ga­pore – has sold more than one mil­lion units since it was first launched in 1991.</p>
