    <p>Bil­lion­aire hedge fund man­ager Ken Grif­fin’s fi­nance com­pa­nies plan to open a Sin­ga­pore of­fice this year in a fresh push to ex­pand in Asia.

    <p>CHICAGO • Bil­lion­aire hedge fund man­ager Ken Grif­fin’s fi­nance com­pa­nies plan to open a Sin­ga­pore of­fice this year in a fresh push to ex­pand in Asia.</p>
    <p>The new of­fice will be shared by his Ci­tadel hedge fund busi­ness and the mar­ket-making Ci­tadel Se­cu­ri­ties unit, the Chicago-based firm said in an e-mail state­ment yes­ter­day. Both will con­tinue to grow their Hong Kong op­er­a­tions and Ci­tadel Se­cu­ri­ties is ex­pand­ing in Shang­hai and Sydney as it broad­ens trad­ing ac­tiv­i­ties, it added.</p>
    <p>“The Asia-Pa­cific con­tin­ues to be an im­por­tant fo­cus for both Ci­tadel and Ci­tadel Se­cu­ri­ties,” Mr John Buck­ley, who re­joined Ci­tadel in 2018 as re­gional chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer, said in the state­ment. “We are ex­cited to fur­ther ex­tend our pres­ence in the re­gion.”</p>
    <p>Ci­tadel is ac­cel­er­at­ing its ex­pan­sion af­ter the se­cu­ri­ties unit used its tech­nol­ogy edge to ce­ment its po­si­tion as one of the largest traders of stocks, bonds and de­riv­a­tives. Trad­ing has boomed glob­ally as the Covid-19 pan­demic and an oil shock dis­rupted mar­kets and prompted in­vestors to eval­u­ate their hold­ings. Its flag­ship multi-strat­egy hedge fund gained 16.5 per cent in the first seven months of the year.</p>
    <p>In June, Ci­tadel’s Sur­veyor Cap­i­tal fun­da­men­tal eq­uity hedge fund unit made its first hires in the re­gion, re­cruit­ing a team led by Hong Kong-based Nick Tay­lor, who had a five-month stint with Ci­tadel in 2008. The se­cu­ri­ties unit in</p>
    <p>Oc­to­ber last year hired Ms Kelly Wang from Cit­i­group to lead re­gional fixed in­come.</p>
    <p>The ex­pan­sion will give it bet­ter ac­cess to the Sin­ga­pore tal­ent pool and help Ci­tadel Se­cu­ri­ties com­pete with ri­val mar­ket-mak­ers in the re­gion, in­clud­ing Op­tiver BV and Susque­hanna In­ter­na­tional Group.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tory changes have broad­ened the range of se­cu­ri­ties avail­able in Asia. Mean­while, ris­ing ten­sions be­tween the world’s two largest economies are lead­ing a grow­ing num­ber of Chi­nese com­pa­nies to dual-list in Hong Kong, which may help boost trad­ing. The Asia-Pa­cific re­gion now rep­re­sents more than 34 per cent of world stock mar­ket value, just 5 per­cent­age points be­hind North Amer­ica, ac­cord­ing to data com­piled by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, Ci­tadel Se­cu­ri­ties agreed on a US$97 mil­lion (S$133 mil­lion) “ad­min­is­tra­tive rec­on­cil­i­a­tion” with the Chi­nese se­cu­ri­ties reg­u­la­tor for is­sues re­lated to the struc­ture of cer­tain lo­cal ac­counts of one of its units.</p>
    <p>The deal ended a years-long reg­u­la­tory probe that be­gan af­ter the 2015 do­mes­tic mar­ket rout and freed it to re­sume ex­pan­sion in Asia’s largest econ­omy, which is widen­ing for­eign ac­cess.</p>
    <p>Ci­tadel man­aged US$34 bil­lion of as­sets glob­ally as of early last month, ac­cord­ing to its web­site. The hedge fund unit has op­er­ated in the re­gion af­ter open­ing a Hong</p>
    <p>Ci­tadel is ac­cel­er­at­ing its ex­pan­sion af­ter the se­cu­ri­ties unit used its tech­nol­ogy edge to ce­ment its po­si­tion as one of the largest traders of stocks, bonds and de­riv­a­tives.</p>
    <p>Kong of­fice in 2005, and was the first in­ter­na­tional hedge fund to raise yuan cap­i­tal from Chi­nese wealthy in­di­vid­u­als and com­pa­nies for overseas in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>Its se­cu­ri­ties unit is a mar­ket­maker for fixed-in­come notes, stocks and op­tions. It be­gan op­er­a­tions in the re­gion in 2009 with a Hong Kong of­fice and now trades in ma­jor re­gional mar­kets, in­clud­ing main­land China, Hong Kong, Ja­pan, South Korea, Aus­tralia and Sin­ga­pore, ac­cord­ing to the state­ment.</p>
    <p>Ci­tadel Se­cu­ri­ties ac­counted for about a fifth of the more than 15.5 bil­lion US shares traded in March, when the Covid-19 pan­demic and a Rus­sia-Saudi Ara­bia oil price war trig­gered a mar­ket sell-off.</p>
