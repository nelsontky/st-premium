    <p>Two years af­ter Lornie High­way opened, con­struc­tion equip­ment and de­bris are still strewn by the side of the road, hid­den be­hind green hoard­ings.</p>
    <p>Checks by The Straits Times re­vealed heavy ve­hi­cles, ex­ca­va­tors, soil-test­ing rigs, con­vey­ors and wa­ter tanks clut­ter­ing a plot near Lorong Halwa, which is just off the new high­way and Bukit Brown ceme­tery – a na­ture and her­itage site. They sit amid hillocks of de­bris such as bro­ken con­crete and un­used con­struc­tion ma­te­ri­als.</p>
    <p>The de­bris and equip­ment were left be­hind by Swee Hong, a re­cently delisted lo­cal con­struc­tion com­pany. Swee Hong found it­self sad­dled with fi­nan­cial woes soon af­ter it clinched a $134.7 mil­lion con­tract to build Lornie High­way in Au­gust 2013.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary 2015, it filed an ap­pli­ca­tion in the High Court to pro­pose a debt re­struc­tur­ing plan for its cred­i­tors. In 2016, it raised up to $8 mil­lion by is­su­ing new shares and war­rants to Ready­made Steel Sin­ga­pore, a com­pany owned by In­dian in­fra­struc­ture group Krid­han In­fra. In July 2017, Swee Hong an­nounced it had re­paid its debts.</p>
    <p>But in Jan­uary this year, the com­pany an­nounced that it was rais­ing more funds. In Septem­ber, the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change re­jected Swee Hong’s ap­peal against delist­ing and the counter was re­moved on Sept 23.</p>
    <p>The com­pany was un­reach­able for com­ment, but the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity said it was work­ing with the dis­tressed con­trac­tor to re­move the de­bris at Lornie “as soon as pos­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>Mr Lars Nelle­man, who lives near the Botanic Gar­dens, said the dump site was not only an “eye­sore”, but it also “blocks ac­cess to quite a beau­ti­ful lit­tle spot”.</p>
    <p>The 65-year-old med­i­cal di­rec­tor said that when he first vis­ited the site 25 years ago, “there was al­most no peo­ple around”, but now, it is in­creas­ingly popular with walk­ers, jog­gers and cy­clists.</p>
