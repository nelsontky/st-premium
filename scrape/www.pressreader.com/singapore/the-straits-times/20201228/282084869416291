    <p>Ngee Ann Polytech­nic (NP), which counts Cre­ative Tech­nol­ogy chair­man Sim Wong Hoo and a co-founder of gam­ing chair com­pany Se­cret­lab among its alumni, has made a name for it­self as a school that grooms young en­trepreneur­s.</p>
    <p>It is now in­fus­ing en­trepreneur­ship into its cur­ric­ula for all stu­dents and reach­ing out to sec­ondary school and In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion stu­dents to iden­tify tal­ent early.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with The Straits Times, NP prin­ci­pal Clarence Ti said its push to sup­port such tal­ent is part of an ef­fort to shift away from pure aca­demic achieve­ments and to cre­ate “mul­ti­ple peaks of suc­cess”.</p>
    <p>“The top of the en­trepreneur­ship mountain is the founder, who doesn’t nec­es­sar­ily have a 4.0 grade point av­er­age,” he said.</p>
    <p>To that end, NP launched the free En­trepreneur­ship First Steps course in April to pro­vide younger stu­dents with the know-how and skills to bring their ideas to life.</p>
    <p>The six-hour course has seen close to 1,600 sign-ups, with close to 500 stu­dents sub­mit­ting their busi­ness plans for re­view.</p>
    <p>NP will hold a se­cond run in April to June next year.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, it will also in­tro­duce an en­trepreneur­ship pro­gramme open to all stu­dents from any dis­ci­pline in the new aca­demic year start­ing in April. It ex­pects to take in about 1,000 stu­dents a year un­der this new scheme.</p>
    <p>They can choose from a bas­ket of eight com­po­nents and earn cer­ti­fi­ca­tions that can come in handy for their ca­reers, said Mr Ti.</p>
    <p>Top­ics will cater to stu­dents at vary­ing lev­els of en­trepreneur­ship and cover skills and ar­eas such as start­ing a side hus­tle, e-com­merce, ac­cel­er­a­tor pro­grammes and in­cu­ba­tion. Th­ese can be taught via ac­tiv­i­ties like hackathons, boot camps and com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, al­most all first-year stu­dents – about 3,400 out of an av­er­age co­hort size of 4,500 – will also take a re­vamped foun­da­tional mod­ule in in­no­va­tion and en­trepreneur­ship start­ing in April. This ex­cludes stu­dents who al­ready have sim­i­lar mod­ules.</p>
    <p>Mr Ti said th­ese new ini­tia­tives come on top of NP’s pro­grammes to en­cour­age budding stu­dent en­trepreneur­s, in­clud­ing a global in­tern­ship scheme which started in 2016 and has sent 330 stu­dents to start-ups over­seas.</p>
    <p>NP also pro­vides $3,000 to $5,000 fund­ing to stu­dents with promis­ing busi­ness ideas.</p>
    <p>About 12 projects have re­ceived fund­ing from its Kick­start Fund in each of the past five years.</p>
    <p>Sup­port is also ex­tended to stu­dents be­yond their school­ing years. The polytech­nic’s in­cu­ba­tor space, which was set up in 2013, has housed more than 30 start-ups, up from four when it first be­gan. In to­tal, th­ese star­tups have gen­er­ated more than $15 mil­lion in busi­ness rev­enue and se­cured fund­ing of $7 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Mr Ti said stu­dents have been in­creas­ingly in­ter­ested to start their own busi­ness. A sur­vey of 1,400 stu­dents con­ducted by NP in March showed that 6 per cent of them are al­ready en­trepreneur­s and 27 per cent as­pire to be one.</p>
    <p>Mr Ti said the ap­peal can be partly at­trib­uted to young busi­ness own­ers mak­ing the news, and the preva­lence of so­cial me­dia apps and e-com­merce sites.</p>
    <p>“You see in the last few years the rise of a lot of uni­corns – star­tups with bil­lion-dol­lar val­u­a­tions – not just in the United States,” he said. “In their world, they see a lot of other young peo­ple do­ing very in­ter­est­ing things. A lot of th­ese tech com­pa­nies hire a lot of young peo­ple.”</p>
