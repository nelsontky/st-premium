    <p>Guo­coLand’s Guoco Mid­town, cur­rently the largest Cen­tral Busi­ness District project un­der devel­op­ment, has un­veiled its lat­est ad­di­tion. A se­cond con­do­minium project, Mid­town Mod­ern, will of­fer more than 500 lux­ury apart­ments.</p>
    <p>Guo­coLand’s Guoco Mid­town in­te­grated mixed-use project in Beach Road has un­veiled its lat­est ad­di­tion, one that in­cludes a se­cond condo project.</p>
    <p>The condo – Mid­town Mod­ern – will be part of a larger devel­op­ment known as Guoco Mid­town II an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Guoco Mid­town II sits on a Govern­ment Land Sales site in Tan Quee Lan Street that was se­cured last Septem­ber when Guo­coLand and two Hong Leong Hold­ings sub­sidiaries bid $800.2 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The Mid­town Mod­ern condo com­prises two 30-storey tow­ers with more than 500 apart­ments, and Mid­town Square, a re­tail project above Bugis in­ter­change MRT sta­tion in Tan Quee Lan Street.</p>
    <p>To­gether with the 33-storey, 219-unit Mid­town Bay that was launched last Oc­to­ber, the two condo projects will of­fer more than 700 lux­ury units.</p>
    <p>About 30 per cent of the 219 oneto three-bed­room du­plexes at Mid­town Bay have sold at prices rang­ing from $1.3 mil­lion to $3.8 mil­lion, the de­vel­oper said. De­tails on the Mid­town Mod­ern launch will be an­nounced at a later date.</p>
    <p>Guoco Mid­town – the largest project un­der devel­op­ment in the Cen­tral Busi­ness District – also in­cludes a 30-storey of­fice tower with 770,000 sq ft of pre­mium Grade A space, three re­tail clus­ters and a Net­work Hub. This will be an 80,000 sq ft mem­bers-only busi­ness and so­cial club that con­sists of pri­vate of­fice suites, net­work­ing lounges and meet­ing and con­fer­ence fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Guo­coLand Sin­ga­pore man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Cheng Hs­ing Yao said: “Guoco Mid­town was con­ceived with a vi­sion of how peo­ple will work, live and play in the fu­ture. Part of that fu­ture has ar­rived much sooner.”</p>
    <p>He noted that the devel­op­ment serves as a blue­print for a post-pan­demic devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“Work from home is not a new phe­nom­e­non, but a phe­nom­e­non that was gain­ing strength prior to Covid-19,” said Mr Cheng. “When we con­ceived Guoco Mid­town, we were al­ready look­ing at this emerg­ing trend, and the blur­ring of lines be­tween live, work and play, which means of­fice spa­ces also need to in­cor­po­rate the re­cre­ation el­e­ment.</p>
    <p>“This is not go­ing to be the last shock to the econ­omy. We have to fo­cus on creat­ing a prod­uct that will be fu­ture-ready.”</p>
    <p>As with most projects, con­struc­tion ac­tiv­ity on the site has not re­turned to pre-Covid-19 lev­els given that strin­gent safety mea­sures are still in place.</p>
    <p>“Our site re­opened two weeks ago after be­ing closed for about four months,” Mr Cheng told The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“More than half our con­struc­tion work­force has re­turned, so we are ramp­ing up our pace.</p>
    <p>“But dur­ing the past few months, we have been do­ing con­struc­tion co­or­di­na­tion vir­tu­ally for the en­tire project, which means that once we start build­ing the real thing, it will be more pro­duc­tive.</p>
    <p>“Build­ing a work­ers’ dor­mi­tory on site helps im­prove pro­duc­tiv­ity be­cause it elim­i­nates trav­el­ling and we have bet­ter con­trol on manag</p>
    <p>CATER­ING FOR WORK AND PLAY</p>
    <p>When we con­ceived Guoco Mid­town, we were al­ready look­ing at this emerg­ing trend, and the blur­ring of lines be­tween live, work and play, which means of­fice spa­ces also need to in­cor­po­rate the re­cre­ation el­e­ment. This is not go­ing to be the last shock to the econ­omy. We have to fo­cus on creat­ing a prod­uct that ’’ will be fu­ture-ready.</p>
    <p>MR CHENG HS­ING YAO, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Guo­coLand Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>ing our work­ers’ health.”</p>
    <p>The multi­bil­lion-dol­lar project is ex­pected to be com­pleted in phases be­tween 2022 and 2024.</p>
    <p>Guo­coLand has made some small ad­just­ments to the of­fice devel­op­ment in the light of the pan­demic, but re­mains largely op­ti­mistic.</p>
    <p>“Most com­pa­nies will likely make work from home part of their strat­egy, but it doesn’t mean com­pa­nies don’t need of­fices any more,” noted Mr Cheng.</p>
    <p>“The func­tion of the of­fice will shift from a place where peo­ple re­port to work, to a place where peo­ple go to col­lab­o­rate, gen­er­ate new ideas, new ser­vices, new prod­ucts.”</p>
    <p>The lo­ca­tion of the of­fice will also be­come more im­por­tant, he added. “Even when com­pa­nies down­size, they may also move, but they will place more fo­cus on the qual­ity of the of­fice. When you have to choose only that one of­fice, al­beit a slightly smaller one, you have to make it more mean­ing­ful.”</p>
    <p>To that end, Guoco Mid­town’s “core and flex” con­cept, which pro­vides both long-term ded­i­cated of­fice space and shorter-term of­fices, can of­fer com­pa­nies more flex­i­bil­ity and cost sav­ings, he said.</p>
    <p>“The eco­nomic en­vi­ron­ment has be­come more un­cer­tain. It’s hard for com­pa­nies to project how many peo­ple they need, so the core and flex con­cept has been shown to be rel­e­vant now,” said Mr Cheng.</p>
