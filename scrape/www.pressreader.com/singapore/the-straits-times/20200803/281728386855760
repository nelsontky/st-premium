    <p>WASHINGTON • Wealthy coun­tries have al­ready locked up more than a bil­lion doses of coro­n­avirus vac­cines, rais­ing wor­ries that the rest of the world will be at the back of the queue in the global ef­fort to de­feat the pathogen.</p>
    <p>Moves by the United States and Bri­tain to se­cure sup­plies from Sanofi and part­ner Glax­oSmithK­line, and an­other pact be­tween Ja­pan and Pfizer, are the lat­est in a string of agree­ments.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Union has also been ag­gres­sive in ob­tain­ing shots, well be­fore any­one knows whether they will work.</p>
    <p>Although in­ter­na­tional groups and a num­ber of na­tions are promis­ing to make vac­cines af­ford­able and ac­ces­si­ble to all, doses will likely strug­gle to keep up with de­mand in a world of roughly 7.8 bil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The pos­si­bil­ity that wealth­ier coun­tries will mo­nop­o­lise sup­ply, a sce­nario that played out in the 2009 swine flu pan­demic, has fu­elled con­cerns among poor na­tions and health ad­vo­cates.</p>
    <p>The US, Bri­tain, Euro­pean Union and Ja­pan have so far se­cured about 1.3 bil­lion doses of po­ten­tial Covid-19 im­mu­ni­sa­tions, ac­cord­ing to Lon­don-based an­a­lyt­ics firm</p>
    <p>Airfin­ity. Op­tions to snap up ad­di­tional sup­plies or pend­ing deals would add more than 1.5 bil­lion doses to that to­tal, its fig­ures show.</p>
    <p>“Even if you have an op­ti­mistic as­sess­ment of the sci­en­tific progress, there are still not enough vac­cines for the world,” ac­cord­ing to Mr Ras­mus Bech Hansen, Airfin­ity’s chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer. Most of the vac­cines might also re­quire two doses, he noted.</p>
    <p>A few front run­ners, such as the Univer­sity of Ox­ford and part­ner As­traZeneca and a Pfizer-BioN­Tech col­lab­o­ra­tion, are al­ready in fi­nal­stage stud­ies, fu­elling hopes that a weapon to fight Covid-19 will be avail­able soon.</p>
    <p>But de­vel­op­ers must still clear hur­dles: Prov­ing their shots are ef­fec­tive, gain­ing ap­proval and ramp­ing up man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>World­wide sup­ply might not reach one bil­lion doses un­til the first quar­ter of 2022, Airfin­ity fore­casts.</p>
    <p>In­vest­ing in pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity all over the world is seen as one of the keys to solv­ing the dilemma.</p>
    <p>Sanofi and Glaxo in­tend to pro­vide a sig­nif­i­cant por­tion of world­wide ca­pac­ity next year and in 2022 to a global ini­tia­tive that is fo­cused on ac­cel­er­at­ing de­vel­op­ment and pro­duc­tion and dis­tribut­ing shots eq­ui­tably.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, the Coali­tion for Epi­demic Pre­pared­ness In­no­va­tions, and Gavi, the Vac­cine Al­liance are work­ing to­gether to bring about eq­ui­table and broad ac­cess. They out­lined a US$18 bil­lion (S$25 bil­lion) plan in June to roll out shots and se­cure two bil­lion doses by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive, known as Co­vax, aims to give gov­ern­ments an op­por­tu­nity to hedge the risk of back­ing un­suc­cess­ful can­di­dates and give other na­tions with lim­ited fi­nances ac­cess to shots that would be oth­er­wise un­af­ford­able.</p>
    <p>Mr Seth Berkley, Gavi’s CEO, said coun­tries would need to strike a se­ries of dif­fer­ent agree­ments with vac­cine mak­ers to raise their chances of get­ting sup­plies as some shots would not suc­ceed, a sit­u­a­tion that could lead to bid­ding bat­tles and in­ef­fi­cien­cies.</p>
    <p>“The thing we worry about most is get­ting a tan­gle of deals,” he said in an in­ter­view. “Our hope is with a port­fo­lio of vac­cines, we can get coun­tries to come to­gether.”</p>
    <p>Some 78 na­tions have ex­pressed in­ter­est in join­ing Co­vax, he said. In ad­di­tion, more than 90 low- and middle-in­come coun­tries and economies will be able to ac­cess Covid-19 vac­cines through a Gav­iled pro­gramme, the group said last Fri­day. There is still con­cern the rest of the world might fall be­hind.</p>
    <p>“That is ex­actly what we are try­ing to avoid,” Mr Berkley said.</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca in June be­came the first man­u­fac­turer to sign up to Gavi’s pro­gramme, com­mit­ting 300 mil­lion doses, and Pfizer and BioN­Tech sig­nalled in­ter­est in po­ten­tially sup­ply­ing Co­vax.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion agreed to pro­vide as much as US$2.1 bil­lion to part­ners Sanofi and Glaxo, the big­gest US in­vest­ment yet for Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed, the coun­try’s vac­cine de­vel­op­ment and pro­cure­ment pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The fund­ing will sup­port clin­i­cal tri­als and man­u­fac­tur­ing while al­low­ing the US to se­cure 100 mil­lion doses if it is suc­cess­ful. The coun­try also has an op­tion to re­ceive an ad­di­tional 500 mil­lion doses.</p>
    <p>The EU is clos­ing in on a deal for as many as 300 mil­lion doses of the Sanofi-Glaxo shot, and is in ad­vanced dis­cus­sions with sev­eral other com­pa­nies, ac­cord­ing to a state­ment last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“The Euro­pean Com­mis­sion is also com­mit­ted to en­sur­ing that ev­ery­one who needs a vac­cine gets it, any­where in the world, and not only at home,” it said.</p>
    <p>The US has in­vested in a num­ber of other projects. Pfizer and BioN­Tech last month reached a US$1.95 bil­lion deal to sup­ply their vac­cine to the gov­ern­ment, should reg­u­la­tors clear it. No­vavax ear­lier last month an­nounced a US$1.6 bil­lion deal, while the US ear­lier pledged as much as US$1.2 bil­lion to As­traZeneca to spur de­vel­op­ment and pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>US in­vest­ment is good news for the world, Mr Berkley said.</p>
    <p>“It helps drive the sci­ence for­ward,” he said. “On that, I am very pos­i­tive. My con­cern is that we need global sup­ply.”</p>
