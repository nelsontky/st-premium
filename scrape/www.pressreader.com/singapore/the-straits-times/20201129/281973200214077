    <p>What makes a Sin­ga­porean? New cit­i­zens con­tem­plat­ing this are now of­fered some guid­ance in the form of a re­port by Sin­ga­pore­ans, both lo­cal-born and nat­u­ralised, that was pub­lished yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The eight chap­ters of the 57-page re­port ex­plore what it means to be a Sin­ga­porean. They share in­sights on a cit­i­zen’s val­ues, roles and re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, and con­tri­bu­tions to so­ci­ety. They also delve into the na­tion’s art, cul­ture and his­tory.</p>
    <p>The re­port high­lights five shared val­ues, in­clud­ing plac­ing so­ci­ety above self, seek­ing con­sen­sus in­stead of con­flict, and ap­pre­ci­at­ing racial and religious har­mony.</p>
    <p>Com­ing after seven months of di­a­logue and de­lib­er­a­tion by the Cit­i­zens’ Work­group for the Sin­ga­pore Cit­i­zen­ship Jour­ney, the re­port also urges new cit­i­zens to con­trib­ute to so­ci­ety in var­i­ous ways.</p>
    <p>An ex­am­ple would be vol­un­teer­ing as a mu­seum do­cent to im­prove one’s own – as well as vis­i­tors’ – un­der­stand­ing of Sin­ga­pore’s in­tri­ca­cies and nu­ances.</p>
    <p>Vol­un­teer­ing in ar­eas such as com­mu­nity gar­den­ing could also help to fos­ter con­nec­tions among the com­mu­nity, said the re­port.</p>
    <p>A mem­ber of the work­group, Ms Shereen Mohd Idris, said par­tic­i­pat­ing in the dis­cus­sions and re­flect­ing on what makes a Sin­ga­porean was a mean­ing­ful jour­ney.</p>
    <p>The 36-year-old public ser­vant added: “The ex­pe­ri­ence re­veals how Sin­ga­pore­ans are cul­tur­ally rich and hold an in­cred­i­ble repos­i­tory of so­cial cap­i­tal that is al­ways re­spect­ful, in­clu­sive and ever wel­com­ing to oth­ers.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a vir­tual me­dia brief­ing held yes­ter­day, mem­bers of the work group ac­knowl­edged that iden­tity is­sues were not clear cut, and that dif­fer­ent in­di­vid­u­als would have dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives on what should be in­cluded in the re­port for new cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, work-group mem­bers dif­fered on the is­sues to be in­cluded in the chap­ter on Sin­ga­pore’s fu­ture as a na­tion and which broad trends would have se­ri­ous im­pli­ca­tions for it.</p>
    <p>One ex­am­ple was bi­lat­eral re­la­tions. Ms Shahrany Has­san, 44, founder and di­rec­tor of a lo­cal non­govern­ment group to pro­mote so­cial co­he­sion, said one of the mem­bers of the work group felt strongly that this was an is­sue that should be in­cluded in the re­port.</p>
    <p>“The per­son felt that new cit­i­zens will not un­der­stand why our min­is­ters or govern­ment of­fi­cials strive to main­tain good re­la­tions with our im­me­di­ate neigh­bours, as you don’t see this as much in other de­vel­oped coun­tries,” said Ms Shahrany.</p>
    <p>After much dis­cus­sion, a de­ci­sion was made among the group to in­clude this in the re­port, she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Jill Wong, se­nior di­rec­tor of the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth’s (MCCY) re­silience and en­gage­ment di­vi­sion, said the re­port will con­trib­ute to the manda­tory cur­ricu­lum which new cit­i­zens have to fol­low be­fore be­com­ing full-fledged mem­bers of Sin­ga­porean so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>While the au­thor­i­ties have taken in feed­back from the public over the years, the work group, con­vened by the MCCY in Jan­uary, is the first of its kind.</p>
    <p>Its aim is to give in­put on the Sin­ga­pore Cit­i­zen­ship Jour­ney pro­gramme. A to­tal of 93 peo­ple took part. In­tro­duced in 2011, the Sin­ga­pore Cit­i­zen­ship Jour­ney is a manda­tory pro­gramme for nat­u­ralised cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>MCCY said it will pro­vide a for­mal re­sponse to the Cit­i­zens’ Work­group in Jan­uary next year.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong thanked the work-group mem­bers for step­ping for­ward and adapt­ing to the dig­i­tal ses­sions held amid the Covid-19 pan­demic. “They ex­em­plify the ethos of Sin­ga­pore To­gether by work­ing with the Govern­ment, and one an­other, for the com­mon good. We will con­tinue to part­ner and en­gage Sin­ga­pore­ans in build­ing our shared fu­ture.”</p>
