    <p>Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den branded US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump a “cli­mate ar­son­ist” on Mon­day for re­fus­ing to ac­knowl­edge global warm­ing’s role in deadly wild­fires sweep­ing the western United States, while Mr Trump blamed lax forestry and de­clared: “I don’t think sci­ence knows.”</p>
    <p>CAL­I­FOR­NIA • Mr Joe Bi­den branded US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump a “cli­mate ar­son­ist” on Mon­day for re­fus­ing to ac­knowl­edge global warm­ing’s role i n deadly wild­fires sweep­ing the western United States, while Mr Trump blamed lax forestry and de­clared: “I don’t think sci­ence knows.”</p>
    <p>Dozens of con­fla­gra­tions have raged with un­prece­dented scope across some 1.8 mil­lion ha in Ore­gon, Cal­i­for­nia and Wash­ing­ton states since last month, de­stroy­ing thou­sands of homes and killing at least 36 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The fires have also filled the re­gion’s air with harm­ful lev­els of smoke and soot, bathing skies in eerie tones of or­ange and sepia.</p>
    <p>Ten deaths have been con­firmed dur­ing the past week in Ore­gon, the lat­est flash­point in a larger sum­mer out­break of fires ac­com­pa­nied by cat­a­strophic light­ning storms, record-break­ing heat­waves and bouts of ex­treme winds.</p>
    <p>Those con­di­tions gave way over the weekend to cooler, moister weather and calmer winds, en­abling weary fire­fight­ers to gain ground in ef­forts to out­flank blazes.</p>
    <p>But fire man­agers warned that the bat­tle was hardly over. Thun­der­storms fore­cast for later in the week could bring much-needed rain but also more light­ning.</p>
    <p>At least 25 peo­ple have died in the Cal­i­for­nia wild­fires since mid-Au­gust and one fa­tal­ity has been con­firmed in Wash­ing­ton state.</p>
    <p>More than 6,200 homes and other struc­tures have been lost.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, the Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee, spoke from his home state of Delaware on the threat of in­creas­ingly fre­quent weather ex­tremes that sci­en­tists have said is ev­i­dence that cli­mate change is su­per­charg­ing the fires.</p>
    <p>“I think this is more of a man­age­ment sit­u­a­tion,” Mr Trump an­swered, when asked by a reporter if cli­mate change was a fac­tor be­hind the fires. With­out men­tion­ing large wild­fires that have raged else­where in re­cent years – from south­ern Europe to Aus­tralia to Siberia – he as­serted that other coun­tries “don’t have this prob­lem”.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has long sought to pin the blame for large wild­fires on state of­fi­cials, say­ing fuel-choked forests and scrub need to be thinned and flammable de­bris cleared from for­est floors.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump said im­proved for­est man­age­ment was some­thing that could be tack­led quickly, while cli­mate change would re­quire in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion that was lack­ing.</p>
    <p>“When you get into cli­mate change, well, is In­dia go­ing to change its ways? And is China go­ing to change its ways? And Rus­sia?” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has re­ferred to cli­mate change as a “hoax”, and in 2017 pulled the US out of the Paris ac­cords lay­ing out an in­ter­na­tional ap­proach to global warm­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, who leads Mr Trump in na­tional polls ahead of the Nov 3 elec­tion, has listed cli­mate change as a ma­jor crisis fac­ing the US.</p>
    <p>Call­ing Mr Trump a “cli­mate ar­son­ist”, Mr Bi­den said: “If we have four more years of Trump’s cli­mate de­nial, how many sub­urbs will be burned by wild­fires? How many suburban neigh­bour­hoods will have been flooded out?”</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia Gov­er­nor Gavin New­som ac­knowl­edged more needs to be done to bet­ter manage forests to re­duce fire risks, but coun­tered that global warm­ing was nev­er­the­less a driv­ing fac­tor in the newly ex­treme wild­fire be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>He re­minded Mr Trump that 57 per cent of for­est land in Cal­i­for­nia is un­der fed­eral own­er­ship.</p>
    <p>“We come from a per­spec­tive, humbly, where we sub­mit the sci­ence is in and ob­served ev­i­dence is self-ev­i­dent – that cli­mate change is real, and that it is ex­ac­er­bat­ing this,” Mr New­som said.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, who has au­tho­rised fed­eral dis­as­ter aid for Cal­i­for­nia and Ore­gon, ques­tioned it.</p>
    <p>“It’ll start get­ting cooler, you just watch,” he said. “I don’t think sci­ence knows.”</p>
