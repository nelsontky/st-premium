    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans will be re­lieved and re­as­sured in equal mea­sure by the an­nounce­ment that free Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tions will be of­fered to all Sin­ga­pore­ans and long-term res­i­dents who are cur­rently here. A whole-of-gov­ern­ment ef­fort, car­ried out painstak­ingly be­hind the scenes since the early stages of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, has borne fruit in get­ting Sin­ga­pore early ac­cess to vac­cines. A com­mit­tee of doc­tors and ex­perts has been set up by the Min­istry of Health to rec­om­mend a vac­ci­na­tion strat­egy for the na­tion. If ev­ery­thing goes ac­cord­ing to plan, Sin­ga­pore will have enough vac­cines for ev­ery­one here by the third quar­ter of next year. Those at great­est risk will be given first pri­or­ity, but pro­gres­sive cov­er­age will ex­tend the in­oc­u­la­tion to the rest of the pop­u­la­tion so that ev­ery­one who wants to be vac­ci­nated will be safe by the end of next year. The prospect of a fully vac­ci­nated pop­u­la­tion is a wel­come devel­op­ment and rep­re­sents the prover­bial light at the end of the tun­nel af­ter a year of news dom­i­nated by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Al­though vac­ci­na­tion will not be com­pul­sory, Sin­ga­pore­ans should avail them­selves of this pro­tec­tion once it be­comes avail­able, un­less they have health con­di­tions that could make in­oc­u­la­tion risky. The early signs are that the vac­cines have proved to be ef­fec­tive against the dis­ease, but whether they are as use­ful in pre­vent­ing in­fec­tion is un­der study. Later-gen­er­a­tion vac­cines might com­bine preven­tion of dis­ease and in­fec­tion in the first place. While this means that vac­cines are not a sil­ver bul­let, the larger the num­ber of in­oc­u­lated peo­ple and the sooner this can hap­pen, the greater the pro­tec­tion that so­ci­ety will en­joy as a whole.</p>
    <p>There is rea­son to be­lieve that the take-up rate here will be high enough for the vac­cines to make a crit­i­cal dif­fer­ence. A re­cent sur­vey com­mis­sioned by this news­pa­per of 1,000 peo­ple aged 16 and above found that about eight in 10 were will­ing to be vac­ci­nated. The poll sug­gests that Sin­ga­pore­ans are far more open to Covid-19 vac­cines than peo­ple in coun­tries such as the United States. Now that Sin­ga­pore has ap­proved the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine, the prospects of pro­tec­tion from Covid-19 are no longer hy­po­thet­i­cal. The con­crete avail­abil­ity of a so­lu­tion should en­cour­age more Sin­ga­pore­ans to opt for vac­ci­na­tion. Apart from the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine, Sin­ga­pore has signed ad­vance pur­chase agree­ments with the mak­ers of the most promis­ing can­di­dates, in­clud­ing Moderna and Si­no­vac.</p>
    <p>Di­ver­si­fy­ing sources of sup­ply is im­por­tant, given the ex­pected in­ter­na­tional rush to vac­cin­e­mak­ers. Ul­ti­mately, the safety and ef­fec­tive­ness of vac­cines are what count the most in the choices that peo­ple make. The health author­i­ties here have been ac­tive in mon­i­tor­ing both as­pects. As the vac­cines come on board, they of­fer a way out of a year-long cri­sis like no other.</p>
