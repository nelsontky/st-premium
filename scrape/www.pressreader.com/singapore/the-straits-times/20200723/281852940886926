    <p>India is un­der­tak­ing what could be the big­gest over­haul of all its crim­i­nal laws, but the com­mit­tee set up by the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs to re­view the colo­nial-era laws is fac­ing strong crit­i­cism.</p>
    <p>On May 4, the min­istry es­tab­lished a five-mem­ber com­mit­tee to rec­om­mend re­forms to crim­i­nal laws in a man­ner that “en­sures the safety and se­cu­rity of the in­di­vid­ual, the com­mu­nity and the na­tion; and which pri­ori­tises the con­sti­tu­tional val­ues of jus­tice, dig­nity and the in­her­ent worth of the in­di­vid­ual”.</p>
    <p>The In­dian Pe­nal Code was drafted by Bri­tish of­fi­cials in 1860, and the Ev­i­dence Act in 1872. De­spite amend­ments over time, many parts of the law re­tain a strong whiff of colo­nial ideas and Vic­to­rian moral­ity.</p>
    <p>Rape within mar­riage is still not con­sid­ered a crime, state gov­ern­ments of­ten ar­rest critics for sedi­tion, and pro­longed pre-charge and pre-trial de­ten­tion are per­mit­ted. Same-sex re­la­tions and adul­tery were de­crim­i­nalised by the Supreme Court only in 2018, after more than 150 years.</p>
    <p>The com­mit­tee re­leased its first con­sul­ta­tion ques­tion­naire on July 4, with ques­tions on crimes in­clud­ing sedi­tion, mar­i­tal rape, hon­our killings and mob lynch­ings. An­other ques­tion­naire re­leased last Satur­day cov­ers laws in­clud­ing those on hate speech, blas­phemy and wrong­ful pros­e­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>But the com­mit­tee has only six months to fin­ish its work. Its con­sul­ta­tion process in­vites on­line com­ments to six ques­tion­naires re­leased in phases.</p>
    <p>A group of 16 former judges, 100 lawyers and many le­gal aca­demics wrote a let­ter to the com­mit­tee say­ing the deadline was not fea­si­ble, and asked why this com­plex en­deav­our was be­ing done in the mid­dle of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, “when 600 In­di­ans are dy­ing ev­ery day and when large swathes of the coun­try are in lock­down or in con­tain­ment”.</p>
    <p>“An over­haul of crim­i­nal law as we have known it after 900 years of com­mon law and al­most 150 years of es­tab­lished ju­rispru­dence is too se­ri­ous a mat­ter to be wrapped up in all of six months,” the let­ter said.</p>
    <p>An­other let­ter from over 150 fe­male lawyers asked why the com­mit­tee com­prised five dom­i­nant­caste Hindu men and no women, lower-caste Dal­its, re­li­gious mi­nori­ties, trib­als, les­bian, gay, bi­sex­ual and trans­gen­der per­sons, or peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The let­ter said: “It seems to us sim­ply ab­surd that, when a large part of the ques­tion­naire is de­voted specif­i­cally to reform of sex­ual of­fences, women prac­ti­tion­ers of crim­i­nal law have not been in­cluded on the com­mit­tee.”</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the rul­ing Bharatiya Janata Party have pre­vi­ously been clear about their po­si­tion on some con­tentious is­sues that the com­mit­tee will con­sider.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, De­fence Min­is­ter Ra­j­nath Singh said last year that the party would make the law on sedi­tion (a crime pun­ish­able with life im­pris­on­ment) “even more strin­gent”.</p>
    <p>The fe­male lawyers say the ques­tion­naire-based method­ol­ogy seems to in­di­cate that the com­mit­tee has al­ready ar­rived at cer­tain fore­gone con­clu­sions.</p>
    <p>“Laws in any coun­try should evolve with time, but we would be very dis­turbed if the fun­da­men­tal ba­sis on which crim­i­nal law is built in this coun­try is changed,” said Ms Re­becca John, a se­nior Del­hibased lawyer.</p>
    <p>She was re­fer­ring to the prin­ci­ples that a per­son is in­no­cent un­til proven guilty, gets a fair trial at all stages, and any con­fes­sion to po­lice of­fi­cers is not ad­mis­si­ble as proof in court.</p>
    <p>Le­gal experts and former judges are wary of the com­mit­tee giv­ing in to pop­ulist de­mands of more polic­ing and harsher pun­ish­ments.</p>
    <p>They are ask­ing for larger en­gage­ment with stake­hold­ers over a pe­riod longer than six months as le­gal reform com­mit­tees, such as the one to reform rape laws and up­date elec­tronic ev­i­dence stan­dards, have done in the past.</p>
