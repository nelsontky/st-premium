    <p>NEW DELHI In­dia’s top mil­i­tary com­man­der has said that a tense bor­der stand-off with Chi­nese forces in the west­ern Hi­malayas could spark a larger con­flict, even as se­nior com­man­ders from both sides met near the front line for their eighth round of talks.</p>
    <p>Chief of De­fence Staff Bipin Rawat said yes­ter­day that the sit­u­a­tion was tense at the Line of Ac­tual Con­trol, the de facto bor­der, in east­ern Ladakh, where thou­sands of In­dian and Chi­nese troops are locked in a months-long con­fronta­tion.</p>
    <p>“We will not ac­cept any shift­ing of the Line of Ac­tual Con­trol,” Gen­eral Rawat said in an on­line ad­dress.</p>
    <p>“In the over­all se­cu­rity cal­cu­lus, bor­der con­fronta­tions, trans­gres­sions and un­pro­voked tac­ti­cal mil­i­tary ac­tions spi­ralling into a larger con­flict can­not there­fore be dis­counted,” he said.</p>
    <p>Bru­tal hand-to-hand com­bat in June left 20 In­dian and an undis­closed num­ber of Chi­nese sol­diers dead, es­ca­lat­ing ten­sions and trig­ger­ing large de­ploy­ments in the re­mote, des­o­late bor­der area.</p>
    <p>Both sides have since at­tempted to ease the sit­u­a­tion through diplo­matic and mil­i­tary chan­nels, but have made lit­tle head­way, leav­ing sol­diers fac­ing off in sub-zero tem­per­a­tures in Ladakh’s snow deserts.</p>
    <p>Se­nior In­dian and Chi­nese com­man­ders were meet­ing yes­ter­day in Ladakh in the eighth round of talks be­tween the mil­i­tary lead­er­ships since the cri­sis be­gan, of­fi­cials in New Delhi said.</p>
    <p>The talks would likely in­clude dis­cus­sions on a Chi­nese pro­posal to pull some troops back from a con­tested area on the north­ern bank of Pan­gong Tso lake, where sol­diers are sep­a­rated by a few hun­dred me­tres, ac­cord­ing to an</p>
    <p>In­dian of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>In­fantry troops, backed by ar­tillery and ar­moured ve­hi­cles, are also fac­ing off on the south­ern bank of the lake, where China has been push­ing In­dia to pull back, the of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>Gen Rawat also warned that In­dia may have to reckon with twin con­flicts – with Pak­istan and China – at the same time, along its west­ern and north­ern bor­ders.</p>
