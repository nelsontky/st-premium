    <p>The Na­tional School Games may have been axed this year, but</p>
    <p>309 stu­dent-ath­letes will still be recog­nised at the 50th Sin­ga­pore School Sports Coun­cil Colours Awards.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional School Games (NSG) may have been axed this year ow­ing to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, but 309 stu­dent-ath­letes will still be recog­nised for their sport­ing achieve­ments and good char­ac­ter at the 50th Sin­ga­pore School Sports Coun­cil Colours Awards.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) an­nounced yesterday that the win­ners of this year’s awards were se­lected based on their per­for­mances in com­pe­ti­tions – such as last year’s SEA Games – be­fore the pan­demic. Achieve­ments and par­tic­i­pa­tion in ex­ter­nal events were also con­sid­ered in pre­vi­ous edi­tions of the awards.</p>
    <p>There was also no change to the ap­praisal pe­riod from Septem­ber last year to Au­gust for this year’s awards, though the num­ber is sig­nif­i­cantly lower than the 8,700 re­cip­i­ents from se­condary schools, ju­nior colleges and Mil­len­nia In­sti­tute for last year.</p>
    <p>“While there were fewer com­pe­ti­tion op­por­tu­ni­ties for sports this year, it is im­por­tant to con­tinue en­cour­ag­ing our stu­dent-ath­letes by recog­nis­ing those who have ex­celled in their in­di­vid­ual sports,” said the MOE.</p>
    <p>The move was lauded by stu­den­tath­letes, coaches and par­ents.</p>
    <p>Edge­field Se­condary School stu­dent Re­gan Chin, who is this year’s Best Sports­boy for taek­wondo, is among the 39 who will re­ceive the Best Sports­boy and Best Sports­girl awards. They in­clude na­tional ath­letes Koen Pang (ta­ble ten­nis), Gan Ching Hwee (swim­ming) and Lin­coln For­est Liqht Man (gym­nas­tics).</p>
    <p>“I feel quite ap­pre­ci­ated be­cause some­times stu­dent-ath­letes’ ef­forts are not recog­nised and some may feel like they’re not achiev­ing any­thing and quit the sport,” said 14-year-old Re­gan.</p>

    <p>RE­GAN CHIN, Edge­field Se­condary School stu­dent, on re­ceiv­ing the Best Sports­boy award for taek­wondo.</p>
    <p>The play­ers are all very dis­ap­pointed that there was no NSG so it’s good that there’s this, given the ef­fort they put in to train.</p>
    <p>KOK MUN WAI, net­ball coach, on the ax­ing of the Na­tional School Games ow­ing to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Guo Xi­uwen, whose daugh­ter Sara plays bad­minton, said: “To a cer­tain ex­tent, this gives the stu­dents the mo­ti­va­tion to con­tinue to work hard as they are con­vinced that their ef­forts are not in vain.”</p>
    <p>Ma­rina Tan, whose son Ig­natius is a vol­ley­ball player, agreed, say­ing that it would be a form of en­cour­age­ment for stu­dent-ath­letes to “do well in com­pe­ti­tions de­spite this dif­fi­cult time”.</p>
    <p>Net­ball coach Kok Mun Wai, who coaches CHIJ Se­condary (Toa Payoh) and An­glo-Chi­nese Ju­nior Col­lege also wel­comed the move. “The play­ers were all very dis­ap­pointed that there was no NSG so it’s good that there’s this, given the ef­fort they put in to train,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ten­nis coach Gary Tan was wor­ried that this year’s for­mat might only give recog­ni­tion to elite ath­letes.</p>
    <p>But the 51-year-old, who coaches Raf­fles Girls’ School, added that “there’s noth­ing too much to say whether it’s fair be­cause this sit­u­a­tion is un­prece­dented”.</p>
    <p>To avoid mass gath­er­ings, the awards will be pre­sented to re­cip­i­ents by their re­spec­tive schools dur­ing school-based cer­e­monies.</p>
