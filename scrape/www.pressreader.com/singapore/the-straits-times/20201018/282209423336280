    <p>LON­DON • Southampto­n came from be­hind twice yes­ter­day to earn a 3-3 draw at Chelsea, de­spite Timo Werner scor­ing two skil­ful in­di­vid­ual goals for the home side, his first in the Premier League.</p>
    <p>Southampto­n’s Jan­nik Vester­gaard scored from a free kick in in­jury time af­ter an en­ter­tain­ing and open game of fluc­tu­at­ing for­tunes.</p>
    <p>“I was con­fi­dent we’d get an­other chance on the sec­ond-half per­for­mance,” said the Saints de­fender. “I was happy to get the chance and guide the ball in. On the sec­ond­half per­for­mance, it was de­served.”</p>
    <p>Werner – who j oined Chelsea from RB Leipzig in June – had ear­lier lit up Stam­ford Bridge with a de­light­ful dum­mied goal in the 15th minute. He scored an­other in the 28th when he lobbed over the ad­vanc­ing Southampto­n goal­keeper Alex McCarthy, then headed into the empty goal.</p>
    <p>The £54 mil­lion (S$94.8 mil­lion) striker should have had a third in the 40th minute, but the Ger­man blazed the ball over the bar.</p>
    <p>Three min­utes later, Southampto­n pulled one back when Danny Ings rounded goal­keeper Kepa Ar­riz­a­bal­aga af­ter Werner’s com­pa­triot Kai Havertz lost the ball deep in the Chelsea half.</p>
    <p>Southampto­n kept up the at­tack­ing pres­sure in the sec­ond half. They earned their equaliser in the 57th minute, af­ter some sham­bolic home de­fend­ing when Kurt Zouma mis­judged a back pass and Kepa missed the ball which Che Adams even­tu­ally slammed into the roof of the net.</p>
    <p>But Chelsea struck back im­me­di­ately with a well-worked goal, the ever-busy Werner cross­ing for Havertz to earn his own first Premier League goal with a sim­ple tapin, only for Southampto­n to equalise again in in­jury time.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Sky Sports, Chelsea have con­ceded an av­er­age of 1.5 goals per game in the Premier League un­der Frank Lam­pard (63 in 43 games), the Blues’ worst rate un­der any man­ager to over­see more than one game in the com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know if we have a prob­lem, but the last three games we con­cede six goals and it is not where we want to be, to com­pete for ti­tles,” said Werner.</p>
    <p>“In Ger­many, we al­ways say de­fence wins ti­tles. If we con­cede so many it is hard to win games and win ti­tles.</p>
    <p>“The first half we played very well. But Southampto­n made a lot of pres­sure on us and pressed us high. We gave them too much in terms of op­por­tu­ni­ties.”</p>
