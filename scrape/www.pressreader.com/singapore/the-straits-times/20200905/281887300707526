    <p>•</p>
    <p>Brazil sur­passed four mil­lion coro­n­avirus cases on Thurs­day, as an in­ter­na­tional panel look­ing into the global re­sponse to the pan­demic vowed to un­cover how it was able to spread world­wide.</p>
    <p>“This is a strong panel poised to ask the hard ques­tions,” said for­mer Liberian pres­i­dent Ellen John­son Sir­leaf, co-chair of the In­de­pen­dent Panel for Pan­demic Pre­pared­ness and Re­sponse (IPPR), which will rake over the heav­ily crit­i­cised World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion-led re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Amnesty In­ter­na­tional said more than 7,000 health care work­ers have died of the virus world­wide, in­clud­ing more than 1,300 in Mex­ico alone, the most for any coun­try.</p>
    <p>The virus con­tin­ued to dis­rupt the world of sport and en­ter­tain­ment, with film­ing of the new Bat­man movie halted in Bri­tain be­cause its star Robert Pat­tin­son re­port­edly tested pos­i­tive for the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>French foot­ball team Paris Sain­tGer­main said three more of its squad had been in­fected, a day af­ter Ney­mar and two team­mates were di­ag­nosed, and Ar­gen­tine foot­ball gi­ants Boca Ju­niors said 18 of its play­ers had tested pos­i­tive just two weeks be­fore restart­ing their Copa Lib­er­ta­dores cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Brazil topped four mil­lion cases with more than 124,000 deaths, se­cond only to the United States. There were al­most 44,000 new cases over the pre­vi­ous 24 hours alone, and 834 fa­tal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>But some ex­perts saw a sil­ver lin­ing in the sta­tis­tics – the South Amer­i­can gi­ant could be on the verge of im­prove­ment.</p>
    <p>“In the last two months, we have seen a curve that mixes re­gions that are in­creas­ing, with oth­ers that are de­creas­ing,” said Univer­sity of Sao Paulo pro­fes­sor of epi­demi­ol­ogy Paulo Lotufo, point­ing to spikes in</p>
    <p>the south and cen­tre-west, while cases were fall­ing in the ma­jor cities of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, as well as in the north.</p>
    <p>But ex­perts warned the sit­u­a­tion could worsen again if lo­cal and re­gional gov­ern­ments re­open the econ­omy too soon, and if so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures are aban­doned.</p>
    <p>As the death toll rose, the IPPR said its mem­bers would have un­fet­tered ac­cess to the WHO’s files.</p>
    <p>The WHO “made it clear that their files are an open book. Any­thing we want to see, we see,” said for­mer New Zealand prime min­is­ter He­len Clark, who co-heads the panel with Ms Sir­leaf.</p>
    <p>“If an­other (pan­demic) took off</p>
    <p>like this in short or­der, how dev­as­tat­ing that would be, now that we know the ex­tent of dam­age that can be done,” she said.</p>
    <p>The WHO has been ac­cused of be­ing slow off the mark to re­act to the ini­tial Covid-19 out­break in China. It has also come un­der fierce at­tack from US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, who is with­draw­ing his coun­try from the UN agency.</p>
    <p>Against that back­drop, WHO mem­ber states in May agreed to a res­o­lu­tion call­ing for an “im­par­tial, in­de­pen­dent and com­pre­hen­sive eval­u­a­tion... to re­view ex­pe­ri­ence gained and lessons learnt from the WHO-co­or­di­nated in­ter­na­tional health re­sponse” to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“De­spite many warn­ings for years now that such a pan­demic was a sig­nif­i­cant global risk, why was the world caught off-guard?” Ms Clark asked.</p>
    <p>Virus dis­rup­tions and travel re­stric­tions have wreaked havoc on the global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Group of 20 for­eign min­is­ters held a vir­tual meet­ing hosted by Saudi Ara­bia to seek in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion over eas­ing travel re­stric­tions and re­open­ing bor­ders.</p>
    <p>Is­rael an­nounced a new lock­down af­fect­ing 30 ar­eas as it grap­ples with one of the world’s high­est in­fec­tion rates and a death toll near­ing 1,000.</p>
