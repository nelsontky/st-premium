    <p>Since the be­gin­ning of the pan­demic, Paul Fre­dette and Karen Karper Fre­dette have made some changes to their lives: Karen Fre­dette stopped at­tend­ing her lo­cal ex­er­cise class and the cou­ple whit­tled their in­ter­ac­tions with their neigh­bours down to waves.</p>
    <p>But in many ways, seclu­sion comes nat­u­rally to them. From a house they call Still Wood, nes­tled in the slope of a moun­tain sur­rounded by wild wood­lands, the Fre­dettes live their lives “ori­ented to­wards soli­tude”, which is their pre­ferred way of say­ing that they are her­mits: de­voted to sim­plic­ity, si­lence and prayer. The near­est town, Hot Springs, North Carolina, is 30km away and has a pop­u­la­tion of just un­der 600.</p>
    <p>Paul Fre­dette, 71, is a for­mer Catholic priest, while Karen Fre­dette, 78, spent 30 years in a monastery af­ter high school be­fore leav­ing to live as a hermit in a cabin in West Virginia.</p>
    <p>Since 1996, the cou­ple have over­seen a so­cial net­work for her­mits and the hermit-cu­ri­ous called Raven’s Bread Min­istries. They pro­vide spir­i­tual coun­selling to seek­ers of soli­tude, write books on the topic, run a web­site and de­liver a quar­terly news­let­ter, Raven’s Bread, which in­cludes con­tri­bu­tions from the greater hermit com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>The orig­i­nal idea for Raven’s Bread Min­istries was to val­i­date her­mits’ at­trac­tion to soli­tude. But this sum­mer, the Fre­dettes felt called to min­is­ter to a dif­fer­ent de­mo­graphic: those strug­gling with the iso­la­tion of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. Af­ter notic­ing their av­er­age daily web­site hits went to up to 2,000 in Au­gust, from around 800 pre-pan­demic, the Fre­dettes be­gan creat­ing YouTube videos. Lis­ten­ing to them feels a bit like get­ting a very quiet pep talk from your grand­par­ents or watch­ing an un­usu­ally spir­i­tual au­ton­o­mous sen­sory merid­ian re­sponse video.</p>
    <p>To­day, there are her­mits who have been of­fi­cially pro­fessed by their re­spec­tive re­li­gious in­sti­tu­tions – in Catholi­cism they are called “canon­i­cal her­mits” – and rogue her­mits who an­swer to no spir­i­tual author­ity. There are her­mits who live in caves, like the Hi­malayan Hermit, who spends his summers in a moun­tain crevice 10,000 ft above Gan­gotri, In­dia. But many more hide in plain sight, in sub­urbs and cities.</p>
    <p>Her­mits have never been quite as iso­lated as many as­sume. They have of­ten at­tracted devo­tees and have al­ways had to earn their own liv­ing, which means al­low­ing some con­tact with the out­side world.</p>
    <p>Con­tem­po­rary her­mits might take jobs that re­quire lit­tle hu­man in­ter­ac­tion, like clean­ing houses. They try to fill what ex­tra time they have with spir­i­tual prac­tice, rather than so­cial in­ter­ac­tion, in per­son or on­line, and make choices that sup­port that end. They’ll med­i­tate on their com­mute rather than read the news or an­swer their phone only dur­ing des­ig­nated hours.</p>
    <p>They can live any­where but tend to re­side in mod­est dwellings and avoid mov­ing around un­nec­es­sar­ily. Nev­er­the­less, a hermit should also not be con­fused with a recluse. The dif­fer­ence, Karen Fre­dette said, is that her­mits do not exit so­ci­ety be­cause of mis­an­thropy.</p>
    <p>Her­mits them­selves are torn on the is­sue of whether any­one can em­brace soli­tude.</p>
    <p>“Soli­tude is not like pro­tein,” said Ms Heidi Haverkamp, a Raven’s Bread sub­scriber and author of Holy Soli­tude: Len­ten Re­flec­tions With Saints, Her­mits, Prophets, And Rebels, who de­scribes her­self as a part-time soli­tary.</p>
    <p>“Some peo­ple find what I get from soli­tude in mu­sic or in ex­er­cise – just dif­fer­ent ways that they ac­cess the tran­scen­dent.”</p>
    <p>“Soli­tude is a means,” said John Back­man, a writer and “quasi­her­mit” who af­fil­i­ates with both Zen Bud­dhism and Chris­tian­ity. “It is a means to draw closer to, im­merse one­self in, that or who which is larger than we are, to im­merse our­selves in Spirit, as it were.”</p>
    <p>But the Fre­dettes and other her­mits be­lieve that any­one could ben­e­fit from fun­da­men­tals such as be­ing rooted in place, prac­tis­ing aus­ter­ity and com­mit­ting to a daily sched­ule that pri­ori­tises prayer or med­i­ta­tion – to help them make sense of their iso­la­tion in their lives, re­gard­less of per­son­al­ity type, re­li­gios­ity or life cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>The most po­tent ground­ing force of all, many her­mits said, is na­ture.</p>
    <p>To­day, some her­mits just walk around in a patch of grass, some­thing Sis­ter Rachel Den­ton, a canon­i­cal hermit in Sh­effield, Eng­land, called “prayer walk­ing”. She also picks up lit­ter in the pub­lic park across the street from her home, a com­mu­nity ser­vice she calls her “penance”.</p>
    <p>She said: “Your body do­ing the walk­ing, do­ing the pac­ing; it’s like a mantra.”</p>
