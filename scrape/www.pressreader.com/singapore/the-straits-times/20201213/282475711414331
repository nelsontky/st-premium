    <p>“I’m a real sucker for Christ­mas,” gushes Sophie Kin­sella.</p>
    <p>The best-sell­ing Bri­tish au­thor of the frothy Shopa­holic nov­els had penned a paean to the hol­i­days, last year’s Christ­mas Shopa­holic, in which her hero­ine Becky Bran­don nee Bloom­wood is forced to plan a chaotic fam­ily Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>‘Tis the sea­son for Christ­mas Shopa­holic to rise up the best­seller charts again, along with Kin­sella’s lat­est rom­com, Love Your Life, about a cou­ple who fall in love at first sight, but find it harder to ac­cept each other’s life­styles.</p>
    <p>Kin­sella, 50, usu­ally holds sev­eral large Christ­mas par­ties with her ex­tended fam­ily, but given the Covid-19 pan­demic, she is hav­ing to come up with new tra­di­tions this year, like Zoom car­ols.</p>
    <p>Some tra­di­tions are still on the cards: watch­ing 1992 film The Mup­pet Christ­mas Carol, hav­ing mince pies and play­ing a game in which some­body is blind­folded, an­other per­son rings a bell and they then have to bash them with a pil­low.</p>
    <p>The mother of five chil­dren aged eight to 24 says over Zoom from her home in Dorset: “I think that af­ter this Christ­mas, we’ll know what we value the most. For me, that’s be­ing in touch with fam­ily, even if it’s not face to face.”</p>
    <p>One of the most bank­able names in chick lit to­day, Kin­sella has sold more than 40 mil­lion books.</p>
    <p>A fi­nan­cial jour­nal­ist who had some suc­cess pub­lish­ing nov­els un­der her real name, Madeleine Wick­ham, she cre­ated the Shopa­holic phe­nom­e­non in 2000 with The Se­cret Dreamworld Of A Shopa­holic.</p>
    <p>The se­ries de­tails the misadventu­res of Becky, a young fi­nan­cial jour­nal­ist whose shop­ping ad­dic­tion lands her in se­vere debt.</p>
    <p>Becky has since fea­tured in nine nov­els and been played by Isla Fisher in the 2009 film, Con­fes­sions Of A Shopa­holic.</p>
    <p>Kin­sella has had fans name their chil­dren af­ter her char­ac­ter. “You can’t get a greater hon­our than that.”</p>
    <p>In 2000, Becky had to curb her im­pulses to avoid debt. To­day, she has to reckon with the en­vi­ron­men­tal cri­sis and how it is fu­elled by the kind of ram­pant con­sumerism she en­gages in. She is of­ten at log­ger­heads with her half-sis­ter Jess, a zero-waste ve­gan.</p>
    <p>“Becky is the con­sumer to­day who is driven by im­pulses and de­sires and lured in with ad­ver­tis­ing,” says Kin­sella. “Jess is the voice of the con­science we all have. It’s an uneasy com­pro­mise. We’re try­ing to – not give up shop­ping for­ever, but shop more mind­fully.”</p>
    <p>For in­stance, a new Christ­mas tra­di­tion she has with her sib­lings is to buy one an­other gifts only from char­ity shops.</p>
    <p>“But I’m also re­al­is­tic,” she adds. “We all fall down some way or an­other. And I do think there’s com­edy in our foibles.”</p>
    <p>It has been a mas­sive year for on­line shop­ping, what with the Covid-19 pan­demic keep­ing ev­ery­one home. Kin­sella reck­ons that Becky would be go­ing mad in lock­down. She would have gone wild over Black Fri­day and Cy­ber Mon­day sales – “there at the crack of dawn, her mouse hand click­ing and click­ing”.</p>
    <p>Still, for her hero­ine and her­self, there is noth­ing like the real deal.</p>
    <p>“It’s a freez­ing cold day and you walk into a warm, scented lit-up shop with the smell of cin­na­mon in the air – noth­ing beats that.”</p>
    <p>Kin­sella spent lock­down edit­ing Love Your Life, a stand­alone novel that she de­scribes as “an ex­treme hol­i­day ro­mance – and what comes af­ter”.</p>
    <p>Ava, who thinks of her­self as old­fash­ioned in love – dat­ing apps just lack that spark – goes on an anony­mous writ­ing re­treat in Italy and meets the man of her dreams. Though they know noth­ing about each other, it is love at first sight.</p>
    <p>It is only when they re­turn home that they dis­cover they can­not stand nearly ev­ery­thing else about the other’s life – his job, her dog, his fam­ily, her fur­ni­ture, even the tem­per­a­ture the other per­son sleeps at.</p>
    <p>Kin­sella has been writ­ing rom­coms for two decades and shuf­fled through ev­ery kind of tech­nol­ogy peo­ple have used to find love.</p>
    <p>“When I started writ­ing my books, my char­ac­ters didn’t even have mo­bile phones half the time. I wrote a book where a cou­ple con­nected over phone; I wrote a book about In­sta­gram. Now there are al­go­rithms that claim to match you per­fectly with your cho­sen one.</p>
    <p>“I do think the cur­rent pan­demic has pushed us all to­wards screens. We’re go­ing to have to get around that and re­mem­ber what chem­istry is like.”</p>
    <p>Work­ing on the book in lock­down was a “mas­sive es­cape”, she says. “I wal­lowed in the fact that in my fic­tional world, you can sit next to a com­plete stranger and touch them. All of this was not for­bid­den.</p>
    <p>“I hope that read­ing a light­hearted ro­man­tic com­edy is a way to lift your spir­its through this time – a lit­tle blast of sun­shine, hope and laugh­ter in a strange old year.”</p>
