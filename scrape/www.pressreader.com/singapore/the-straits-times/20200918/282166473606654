    <p>TOKYO • The Bank of Ja­pan (BOJ) left its ag­gres­sive mon­e­tary stim­u­lus un­touched yes­ter­day, while up­grad­ing its view of the pan­demi­chit econ­omy, one day af­ter Mr Yoshi­hide Suga took over as Prime Min­is­ter pledg­ing to con­tinue his pre­de­ces­sor’s stance on mon­e­tary and fis­cal pol­icy.</p>
    <p>In a widely-ex­pected move, the BOJ kept its key in­ter­est rate at -0.1 per cent and left its as­set pur­chases un­changed, a bank state­ment said.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga has in­di­cated that he sees no need for any im­me­di­ate changes in BOJ poli­cies that have helped keep fi­nan­cial mar­kets sta­ble and get credit to com­pa­nies amid Covid-19. The cen­tral bank up­graded its eco­nomic as­sess­ment for the first time since the coron­avirus hit to re­flect a bot­tom­ing in the coun­try’s slump.</p>
    <p>The BOJ said the econ­omy has started to pick up, with ac­tiv­ity re­sum­ing grad­u­ally. It also said overseas economies were im­prov­ing from a state of sig­nif­i­cant de­pres­sion and this had helped turn pro­duc­tion at home and ex­ports to­wards a pickup.</p>
    <p>Still, with the pan­demic con­tin­u­ing to af­fect coun­tries world­wide, the pace of im­prove­ment in Ja­pan’s econ­omy was likely to be only mod­er­ate, the bank said.</p>
    <p>“The BOJ has played its role in fight­ing the pan­demic,” said Tokai Tokyo Se­cu­ri­ties strate­gist</p>
    <p>Kazuhiko Sano be­fore the de­ci­sion. “Suga is com­ing in pledg­ing con­ti­nu­ity so there won’t be much im­pact on mon­e­tary pol­icy.”</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts see gross do­mes­tic prod­uct re­bound­ing an an­nu­alised 15.1 per cent this quar­ter, a big jump, but not enough to make up for the record con­trac­tion i n the three months through June.</p>
    <p>The BOJ de­ci­sion comes j ust hours af­ter the US Fed­eral Re­serve un­veiled its lat­est pol­icy guid­ance, com­mit­ting to in­fla­tion that av­er­ages 2 per cent over time and fore­cast­ing near-zero rates to con­tinue through 2023.</p>
    <p>The yen was trad­ing at 105.06 against the US dol­lar, lit­tle changed from be­fore the de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>While the Fed and Euro­pean Cen­tral Bank look likely to adopt new eas­ing mea­sures within the year, the BOJ will hold off un­less gaps be­tween the poli­cies cause the yen to gain sharply, said econ­o­mist Ken­taro Koyama at Deutsche Bank.</p>
    <p>“The BOJ has al­ready crafted its pol­icy on the as­sump­tion of longterm low in­fla­tion and has min­i­mal room for fur­ther eas­ing ac­tion,” Mr Koyama wrote in a re­port.</p>
    <p>Mar­kets have been re­as­sured by Mr Suga’s pledge to con­tinue the poli­cies of his old boss Shinzo Abe, and 95 per cent of economists say the new Prime Min­is­ter will not pres­sure the BOJ to make any changes.</p>
