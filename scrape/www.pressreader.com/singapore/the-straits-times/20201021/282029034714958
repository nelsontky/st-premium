    <p>When Ms Jan­ice Tan’s 76-year-old fa­ther had an acute stroke at home on Sept 14, he was rushed to Changi Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal (CGH) and warded in the in­ten­sive care unit.</p>
    <p>“There, he was re­strained and he strug­gled a lot,” said Ms Tan, adding that her fa­ther, who has mild de­men­tia, was per­sis­tent about want­ing to go home then.</p>
    <p>When he was trans­ferred to the de­men­tia ward, he calmed down af­ter a few days and stayed on for about three weeks.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan, 48, a sales and mar­ket­ing direc­tor, said the mo­ti­va­tion and pos­i­tiv­ity that the pa­tients re­ceived in the ward made the dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The nurses would call him Mr Tan, she said. “If my dad didn’t eat some­thing, they asked ‘What does he like to eat’, and then, they gave him yo­gurt. Small things like that could get the pa­tient to eat more.”</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lim Si Ching, a se­nior con­sul­tant at CGH’s geri­atric medicine depart­ment, shared this per­son-cen­tred care in the 20-bed de­men­tia ward at a me­dia brief­ing yes­ter­day on the find­ings of a re­cent sur­vey which showed that the min­i­mal use of phar­maco</p>
    <p>log­i­cal re­straints could lead to im­proved be­havioural and mood symp­toms, and well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>Con­ducted from mid-Au­gust to the end of last month, the CGH sur­vey found that 62 per cent of 137 pa­tients fin­ished their meals on the days they had gone for ther­apy, which in­volves do­ing an ac­tiv­ity they like. On the days they did not</p>
    <p>go, they ate only half of their meals.</p>
    <p>Most of them – about 94 per cent – slept for seven to nine hours on the days that they had ther­apy, com­pared with 44 per cent on days when there was no ther­apy.</p>
    <p>Prof Lim said the pa­tients were hap­pier and calmer af­ter the ther­apy ses­sions, which usu­ally lasted for about 30 to 45 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Due to the Covid-19 pan­demic and safe dis­tanc­ing, the pa­tients can­not gather around a big ta­ble as they did in the past. In­stead, the ses­sions are con­ducted with the pa­tients sit­ting in in­di­vid­ual cush­ioned chairs fit­ted with a ta­ble, out on a small bal­cony.</p>
    <p>There, they may en­gage in mu­sic ther­apy, sit-down ex­er­cises, art</p>
    <p>and craft, have break­fast, in­ter­act with a doll or with a ro­botic cat or dog ac­quired ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Some will pre­pare “food” by cut­ting up plas­tic fruit and veg­eta­bles, while oth­ers fold clothes or watch cook­ing videos on YouTube, said Prof Lim.</p>
    <p>She said the col­lec­tion of pa­tients’ in­for­ma­tion on their ar­rival</p>
    <p>– such as their daily rou­tine, di­etary pref­er­ences, hob­bies, sleep pat­terns – is key to tai­lor­ing the care plan.</p>
    <p>“We had an ac­coun­tant, and we would write sums for him to do. So, while oth­ers did their colour­ing, he did his maths,” she said.</p>
    <p>De­men­tia can be caused by more than 70 diseases, of which Alzheimer’s disease is the most com­mon. Symp­toms can in­clude bit­ing, scratch­ing, shout­ing, hoard­ing, anx­i­ety, de­pres­sion, patho­log­i­cal cry­ing, ir­ri­tabil­ity and psy­chosis, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“They may sleep in the day, and at 2am, they will knock on the door and say come on, ev­ery­body, get up and go to work, or they will go to the kitchen and start cook­ing,” said Prof Lim.</p>
    <p>The per­son with de­men­tia lives in a re­al­ity that is con­stantly chang­ing and con­fus­ing, she said.</p>
    <p>“I al­ways tell my nurses: Don’t look at the dif­fi­cult be­hav­iour as a chal­lenge, we must look at it as a communicat­ion fail­ure.”</p>
    <p>In­stead of re­strain­ing an ag­i­tated pa­tient, she said, the nurses will find out why: Is it be­cause he wants to go to the toi­let, or is he hun­gry?</p>
    <p>Prof Lim in­tro­duced per­son-cen­tred care at the de­men­tia ward – which ad­mits elderly pa­tients with de­men­tia symp­toms or delir­ium – in 2015, and said re­straints are used only when there is no choice.</p>
    <p>“When we look at per­sons with de­men­tia, we need to un­der­stand that even if their brain is not work­ing very well any more and their mem­ory is not so good... they can still en­joy mu­sic, sound, colours, and their sense of hu­mour is of­ten still in­tact,” she said.</p>
    <p>Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal also uses per­son-cen­tred care at its de­men­tia ward, and has had a no-re­straints record for seven years now.</p>
