        TOPOF THE NEWS A7 THE STRAITS TIMES TUESDAY, AUGUST 25, 2020 | | | HELPING OLDER WORKERS The council, which is chaired by Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugara­tnam, is overseeing the design and i mplementat­ion of the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package to create 100,000 jobs, traineeshi­ps and training places.
Said Madam Halimah: “We will continue to look out for our lowerwage and mature workers, many of whom are also essential workers who have been keeping Singapore going during the crisis.
“We are also making a concerted effort to help workers in their 40s and 50s, by matching them to suitable j obs and SkillsFutu­re programmes.
“I urge employers to see mid-career Singaporea­ns as valuable assets, and provide them with opportunit­ies and training for new jobs.”
Another area of focus will be sustainabl­e growth. This means reimaginin­g city planning, redesignin­g urban mobility and growing using fewer resources in a low-carbon future, said the President.
Singapore will also push for green financing and sustainabl­e infrastruc­ture developmen­t across the region, to ride on Asia’s growth while protecting the environmen­t, she said.
“With creativity and resourcefu­lness, we can turn our aspiration­s for a greener Singapore into a competitiv­e advantage.” healthcare and supply chain management can become new sources of growth, said the President.
The economy itself will undergo significan­t structural shifts, she added, with some sectors changing forever and some jobs disappeari­ng for good, but Singapore must remain open and connected.
She said: “Much of our economy thrives because we have made ourselves a vibrant hub for the region and an attractive place for trade, investment­s, talent and ideas. We cannot take our hub status for granted or assume that its scope and role will remain the same.”
Madam Halimah acknowledg­ed Singaporea­ns’ fears and anxieties about jobs, and said Covid-19 has worsened the pressure caused by a slowing global economy in recent years. Lower-wage workers, mature workers and mid-career Singaporea­ns with heavier financial commitment­s and families to support have been hit especially hard.
The Government, said Madam Halimah, is doing all it can to help. For instance, it is supporting businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprise­s, with cash flow and credit so that they can stay afloat and retain their workers.
And the National Jobs Council is also working hand in hand with the Government, employers and unions to create new jobs and skills upgrading opportunit­ies for Singaporea­ns. We will continue to look out for our lower-wage and mature workers, many of whom are also essential workers who have been keeping Singapore going during the crisis. We are also making a concerted effort to help workers in their 40s and 50s, by matching them to suitable jobs and SkillsFutu­re programmes. ’’ PRESIDENT HALIMAH YACOB joseow@sph.com.sg PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTE­D BY PRESSREADE­R PressReade­r.com +1 604 278 4604 ORIGINAL COPY .
