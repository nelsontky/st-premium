    <p>Young peo­ple liv­ing through so­ciopo­lit­i­cal up­heavals take cen­tre stage in this mul­ti­me­dia play in­spired by real events.</p>
    <p>The pro­duc­tion, di­rected by Brian Gothong Tan, has three main narratives in­spired by three world events – the Arab Spring, a wave of protests and up­ris­ings that spread across the Mid­dle East and North Africa from 2010 to 2012; the 2018 res­cue of mem­bers of a ju­nior foot­ball team who were trapped in a cave in Thai­land; and the Hong Kong protests that took place in 2019 and last year.</p>
    <p>Tan, 40, hopes the play will get the au­di­ence “think­ing about the (po­lit­i­cal) sys­tems we live in that both nur­ture and kill us”.</p>
    <p>“There’s no such thing as a per­fect sys­tem,” he adds. “The cur­rent sit­u­a­tion (in Hong Kong) was made by po­lit­i­cal forces 50, 100 years ago – even longer if you want to ex­trap­o­late more.</p>
    <p>“We are all in­ter­con­nected some­how and have a role to play. We are not all just pas­sive cit­i­zens of the world, just re­act­ing to this news, even though it seems far away.”</p>
    <p>Im­ages of an­cient cave paint­ings, pho­tos of Hong Kong in the 1980s and more have been wo­ven into Tan’s mul­ti­me­dia pro­jec­tions. Some scenes were also pre­re­corded – the Hong Kong protests, for in­stance, will be shown in a stylised slow-mo­tion se­quence.</p>
    <p>The play was writ­ten by Na­bi­lah Said, 35, and will be per­formed by un­der­grad­u­ates from the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts.</p>
    <p>Na­bi­lah says it was a chal­lenge to de­cide how much de­tail to in­clude.</p>
    <p>“Each of these events could have been a play or a six- to eight-hour­long doc­u­men­tary on their own. I was – and still am – afraid of mis­rep­re­sent­ing or over­sim­pli­fy­ing the sto­ries and events,” she adds.</p>
    <p>“At the same time, how much cre­ative li­cence am I al­lowed to ex­er­cise? That’s still a ques­tion I am ask­ing my­self.”</p>
    <p>The play also tries to cap­ture the hu­man side of these se­ri­ous so­ciopo­lit­i­cal events.</p>
    <p>“Some­thing I told the stu­dents dur­ing one of the re­hearsals,” Na­bi­lah adds, “is that dur­ing a revo­lu­tion, peo­ple are fall­ing in love, get­ting mar­ried, break­ing up with their boyfriends, hav­ing fights with their par­ents.</p>
    <p>“They are still hav­ing the real-life is­sues you and I are hav­ing.”</p>
