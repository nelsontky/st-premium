    <p>With many coun­tries’ bor­ders still mostly closed due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, some air­lines have launched no-des­ti­na­tion flights to give their ail­ing busi­nesses a lift. Tai­wan Correspond­ent Kather­ine Wei took such a flight on the night of the Mid-Au­tumn Fes­ti­val and shares her moon-gaz­ing ex­pe­ri­ence, while Jonathan Pearl­man in Syd­ney looks at the pros and cons of such flights.</p>
    <p>I had never seen the air­port this empty. Taoyuan In­ter­na­tional Air­port is Tai­wan’s main gate­way to in­ter­na­tional travel, with more than 48 mil­lion trav­ellers pass­ing through its doors last year.</p>
    <p>But over the Mid-Au­tumn Fes­ti­val long week­end – usu­ally prime time for peo­ple to head to coun­tries in the re­gion – the air­port was eerily quiet.</p>
    <p>It was also the first time I was tak­ing a flight with just a small bag that con­tained my pass­port, note­book and pen.</p>
    <p>I had booked a three-hour flight around Tai­wan on Thurs­day night, tak­ing off and land­ing at the same air­port. Such flights-to-nowhere are the new­est fad that Tai­wan’s air car­ri­ers are pro­mot­ing.</p>
    <p>The flight I was tak­ing was the first of four “moon-gaz­ing” ser­vices from Thurs­day to yes­ter­day that EVA Air de­signed for the Mid-Au­tumn Fes­ti­val when the moon is full and bright.</p>
    <p>An econ­omy-class ticket cost NT$5,888 (S$278), with a win­dow seat go­ing for NT$1,000 more, and busi­ness-class tick­ets were NT$7,888 each.</p>
    <p>Pas­sen­gers had to show their pass­ports and go through Cus­toms be­fore they got to en­joy duty-free shop­ping.</p>
    <p>The air­craft used by EVA Air was not a small 78-seater tur­bo­prop that Tai­wan’s air­lines usu­ally de­ploy for do­mes­tic flights, but a Boeing 787 Dream­liner built for ul­tra­long-haul jour­neys.</p>
    <p>“It’s a full flight tonight. Ac­tu­ally, all three nights,” said Mr Larry Lai, EVA Air’s pub­lic re­la­tions as­sis­tant man­ager.</p>
    <p>More than 300 peo­ple snapped up the tick­ets once the air­line an­nounced the pro­gramme late last month.</p>
    <p>After get­ting my board­ing pass, I walked through the se­cu­rity check and cleared Cus­toms within a minute.</p>
    <p>There was ex­cite­ment at the board­ing gate where peo­ple were trip­ping over one an­other while try­ing to take photos with the plane in the back­ground.</p>
    <p>There were fam­i­lies of three gen­er­a­tions, cou­ples young and old, and groups of friends who were armed with fancy pho­tog­ra­phy gear.</p>
    <p>Ms Chen Shu-chuan, 51, told The Sun­day Times: “I im­me­di­ately got tick­ets after see­ing this pro­mo­tion.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been dy­ing to travel abroad. The last time we went any­where was when I took my fam­ily to Hokkaido last Oc­to­ber.”</p>
    <p>We had our tem­per­a­tures taken be­fore board­ing. After board­ing, we were each given a gift bag that had a toi­letry kit, hand sani­tiser, a deck of play­ing cards and a cer­tifi­cate holder that we could stick our board­ing pass to, which a mid­dleaged cou­ple next to me en­thu­si­as­ti­cally did.</p>
    <p>Their daugh­ter works as a ground crew mem­ber at EVA Air. Though Tai­wan’s air­lines have not laid off any­one so far this year be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, Ms Cheng Yun-ru, 55, thought the trip would be a good way to sup­port her daugh­ter’s com­pany.</p>
    <p>“Planes are like cars, they need to be main­tained even if they’re not be­ing flown. Why not get a fun trip</p>
    <p>out of it,” she pointed out.</p>
    <p>Although mask-wear­ing was manda­tory ex­cept dur­ing meal time, no so­cial dis­tanc­ing was re­quired on the plane. The vague sense of nor­malcy was com­fort­ing, and per­haps much needed for those on board.</p>
    <p>The plane took off at 6.30pm, and for a minute, it did feel like I was ac­tu­ally go­ing some­where.</p>
    <p>The pi­lot and co-pi­lot took turns an­nounc­ing over the in­ter­com the places that the plane would be fly­ing over, in­clud­ing Lanyang Plains on Tai­wan’s north-east­ern coast, Penghu is­lands off the west coast and Tai­wan’s south­ern-most point.</p>
    <p>The moon was not al­ways vis­i­ble, but each time the plane ad­justed course that made the moon vis­i­ble, the pi­lot would an­nounce it. The pas­sen­gers would rush to the win­dows, with little re­gard for those in the win­dow seats, in­clud­ing me.</p>
    <p>Ms Cheng’s hus­band, who sat in an aisle seat with his wife in be­tween us, stretched out and leaned over me mul­ti­ple times as he tried to take the best shot of the moon, but with­out suc­cess be­cause of the harsh re­flec­tion in the win­dow.</p>
    <p>A cou­ple in front of us de­vised a clever plan: The wife held a blan­ket over her hus­band, form­ing a “tent” that cov­ered him and the win­dow. He snapped away madly.</p>
    <p>The pi­lot took spe­cial care to ma­noeu­vre the plane so that ev­ery­one got a good view of the moon and the cityscapes.</p>
    <p>Din­ner was a choice of Ja­panese or Chi­nese. The Ja­panese meal was de­signed by Miche­lin star restau­rant owner Ha­jime Naka­mura, and the Chi­nese set was from lo­cal restau­rant chain Din Tai Fung.</p>
    <p>By the fifth time Ms Cheng’s hus­band knocked into me with his out­stretched arm, the plane was al­most ready to land at 9.30pm.</p>
    <p>After the plane touched down, Ms Chu Tsai-hong, one of the pas­sen­gers, said: “We were promised about 1,500km but we got 1,646.”</p>
