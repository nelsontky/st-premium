    <p>Malaysia’s bud­get today could be the largest in its his­tory, as the em­bat­tled Muhyid­din Yassin gov­ern­ment will have to pre­serve peo­ple’s lives and liveli­hoods, and boost the econ­omy too, amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>While a sub­stan­tial amount of funds would be chan­nelled to­wards tack­ling the pan­demic and sup­port­ing front-line work­ers, help must also be given to the vul­ner­a­ble as well as busi­nesses so they can drive growth and aid in re­cov­ery next year.</p>
    <p>Fi­nance Min­is­ter Tengku Zafrul Aziz has said that the al­lo­ca­tion for Bud­get 2021 will be big­ger than the RM297 bil­lion (S$97 bil­lion) Bud­get 2020, and that the gov­ern­ment will not cut back on de­vel­op­ment spend­ing.</p>
    <p>“I think this is the most im­por­tant bud­get in our his­tory... we are go­ing through the worst cri­sis,” Datuk Seri Tengku Zafrul was quoted as say­ing by the New Straits Times on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Some econ­o­mists think it could be an elec­tion bud­get.</p>
    <p>Mr Azrul Azwar, an econ­o­mist at a state gov­ern­ment-linked com­pany, told The Straits Times: “In view of the wors­en­ing po­lit­i­cal in­sta­bil­ity by the day, Bud­get 2021 could well be an elec­tion bud­get as there is a high chance of a snap gen­eral elec­tion some time in the first half of next year once the pan­demic is brought un­der con­trol, coin­cid­ing with the time when a safe and ef­fec­tive vac­cine hits the mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s Perikatan Na­sional (PN) pact holds a slim ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment, and its ex­pen­di­ture plan could be chal­lenged by po­lit­i­cal ri­vals seek­ing to un­seat his gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Even if the bud­get passes, threats from PN al­lies to with­draw their sup­port and no-con­fi­dence mo­tions by the op­po­si­tion could still trig­ger a snap elec­tion.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say that among the top pri­or­i­ties would be widen­ing the so­cial safety net, pro­tect­ing the ur­ban poor and bol­ster­ing the health­care sec­tor, all of which have borne the brunt of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment could make an al­lo­ca­tion to fund un­em­ploy­ment in­sur­ance and wage sub­si­dies.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Woo Wing Thye, an eco­nom­ics pro­fes­sor at the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia and re­search pro­fes­sor at Sun­way Univer­sity, said: “It should be the largest bud­get deficit, both in ab­so­lute size and as a per­cent­age of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP).”</p>
    <p>He hopes to see a bud­get that con­tains a di­rect in­fu­sion of pur­chas­ing power into the econ­omy through gov­ern­ment spend­ing, changes in reg­u­la­tions that lower the cost of liv­ing, and in­cen­tives to sup­port an eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>With 5.6 per cent of house­holds in ab­so­lute poverty and 16.9 per cent in rel­a­tive poverty, re­sults from a United Na­tions study re­leased last week showed that many low-in­come house­holds have be­come worse off af­ter the pan­demic hit and re­quire ur­gent so­cial pro­tec­tion. Ab­so­lute poverty is when one can­not af­ford to buy ba­sic ne­ces­si­ties, while rel­a­tive poverty com­pares a house­hold’s eco­nomic stand­ing against oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Unicef Malaysia rep­re­sen­ta­tive Rashed Mustafa Sar­war said: “It is crit­i­cal that we take the op­por­tu­ni­ties cre­ated by the 2021 Bud­get and 12th Malaysia Plan to re­think so­cial pro­tec­tion in Malaysia, to en­sure that no fam­ily, and no child, is left be­hind.”</p>
    <p>Four stim­u­lus pack­ages worth RM305 bil­lion have been rolled out by Mr Muhyid­din’s gov­ern­ment this year to cush­ion the im­pact of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Fis­cal deficits could be around or may even sur­pass RM90 bil­lion, with fis­cal deficit-to-GDP ra­tios eas­ily in ex­cess of 6 per cent, both in 2020 and 2021, said Mr Azrul.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din said a sub­stan­tial amount of funds would be set aside to tackle the pan­demic and sup­port front-line work­ers.</p>
    <p>“We will do it now and con­tinue to do it un­til Covid-19 is over,” he told Ber­nama and lo­cal tele­vi­sion sta­tions on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Al­lo­ca­tions would need to be made for Covid-19 vac­cine pro­cure­ment, but some ex­perts hope that Malaysia will fi­nally look into de­vel­op­ing hu­man vac­cines for dis­eases.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Awang Bulgiba Awang Mah­mud, an epi­demi­ol­o­gist at Univer­siti Malaya, told The Straits Times: “There are so many things that are re­quired for Covid-19, but I am sure the gov­ern­ment has al­ready set aside fund­ing for fight­ing the pan­demic and to pro­cure vac­cines.”</p>
    <p>He said he hoped to see al­lo­ca­tions for the de­vel­op­ment of fast and re­li­able Covid-19 di­ag­nos­tics, which would re­duce Malaysia’s de­pen­dence on for­eign tests, and fund­ing for the re­search and de­vel­op­ment of hu­man vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s econ­omy dived into its first con­trac­tion in the sec­ond quar­ter of this year, record­ing its worst per­for­mance in nearly 22 years, but has since shown signs of re­cov­ery, with the cen­tral bank ex­pect­ing fur­ther im­prove­ment next year.</p>
