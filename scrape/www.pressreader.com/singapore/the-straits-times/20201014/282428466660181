    <p>Ac­tor Nam Joo-hyuk and for­mer pop idol Bae Suzy head­line work­place K-drama about en­trepreneur­s chas­ing their dreams</p>
    <p>Net­flix’s K-drama work-ro­mance se­ries Start-Up starts some­thing be­tween singer-ac­tress Bae Suzy and ac­tor Nam Joo-hyuk.</p>
    <p>It is about young en­trepreneur­s who work at their own start-up firms in Sand­box – a fic­tional Sil­i­con Val­ley-in­spired dis­trict – and ma­ture and fall in love.</p>
    <p>Bae was part of the girl group Miss A and has ap­peared in tele­vi­sion se­ries such as drama fantasy While You Were Sleep­ing (2017), while Nam’s cred­its in­clude the mov­ing drama se­ries The Light In Your Eyes (2019).</p>
    <p>The cast of Start-Up also in­cludes ac­tor Kim Seon-ho and ac­tress Kang Han-na.</p>
    <p>Here are five things to know about the se­ries, which pre­mieres on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>1 NAM JOO-HYUK LETS HIS NERD OUT</p>
    <p>In the se­ries, Nam plays Do-san, a geeky math­e­mat­ics prodigy who loves cod­ing and knits as a hobby.</p>
    <p>The 26-year-old says at a livestream­ed press con­fer­ence on Mon­day: “It wasn’t that big of a chal­lenge for me to por­tray a nerd be­cause be­ing a nerd is part of who I am, ac­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>“I pulled out some of the nerdy qual­i­ties in me and im­bued my char­ac­ter with it – like how in real life, when I get ner­vous in sit­u­a­tions, I ac­tu­ally trem­ble.”</p>
    <p>2 NO CATFIGHTS OFF-SCREEN</p>
    <p>In the se­ries, Bae and Kang play ri­vals. Bae, 26, is Dal-mi, a woman whose am­bi­tion is to be­come South Korea’s Steve Jobs; Kang is a rich heiress who runs her own com­pany.</p>
    <p>Kang (Fa­mil­iar Wife, 2018), 31, says with a laugh: “Suzy is so lov­able that it’s dif­fi­cult for me to bring my claws out with Dal-mi.”</p>
    <p>Bae adds: “Han-na is so bub­bly and we have a lot of fun on set, but be­cause we still had to main­tain a cer­tain level of ten­sion be­tween our char­ac­ters, there were times we could not help but break into laugh­ter dur­ing film­ing.”</p>
    <p>3 THE 2 DAYS & 1 NIGHT CON­NEC­TION</p>
    <p>While Kim (You Drive Me Crazy, 2018) is an ac­tor, he is also a cast mem­ber of the long-run­ning out­door va­ri­ety se­ries 2 Days & 1 Night (2007 to pre­sent), which he joined last year.</p>
    <p>Kim, 34, who says his char­ac­ter in the se­ries is the epit­ome of “young, rich and suc­cess­ful”, adds that he hopes fans of 2 Days & 1 Night will not find it awk­ward watch­ing him act.</p>
    <p>He jokes about the dif­fer­ences be­tween him and his straight­shoot­ing char­ac­ter: “I don’t think I’m as mean with my words to oth­ers – I talk about peo­ple be­hind their backs.”</p>
    <p>4 KANG HAD A HAIR MAKEOVER</p>
    <p>For their roles as young peo­ple work­ing in start-up com­pa­nies, the cast looked at videos of suc­cess­ful young en­trepreneur­s for in­spi­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>Kang even cut her long locks to bet­ter suit the tough busi­ness­woman im­age of her char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>She says: “The hair and make-up team sug­gested that she might be more suited to a short hair­style, so I went ahead and got it cut.”</p>
    <p>5 SPARKLING RO­MANCE</p>
    <p>While direc­tor Oh Choong-hwan says the se­ries’ ap­peal is in its heart­warm­ing story of growth and work­ing hard for one’s dreams, he gives him­self “a pat on the back” for the cast­ing of the cen­tral ro­man­tic cou­ple Nam and Bae.</p>
    <p>He says: “They are just so beau­ti­ful to­gether. I hope peo­ple look at them on screen and re­mem­ber how they sparkle to­gether.”</p>
