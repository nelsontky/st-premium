    <p>AMOUNT THAT S’PORE-SHAN­DONG BI­LAT­ERAL TRADE GREW TO IN FIRST EIGHT MONTHS OF 2020</p>
    <p>Bi­lat­eral trade be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Shan­dong prov­ince in east­ern China grew to US$3 bil­lion (S$4.1 bil­lion) in the first eight months of this year, a 105 per cent in­crease com­pared with a year ago.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for For­eign Af­fairs and Trans­port Chee Hong Tat noted the fig­ures in a Face­book post yes­ter­day as he urged Sin­ga­pore firms to con­tinue in­vest­ing in the coastal area.</p>
    <p>Mr Chee said the strong eco­nomic ties Sin­ga­pore shares with Shan­dong al­lowed com­pa­nies here “to quickly source for es­sen­tials like med­i­cal sup­plies and food when Covid-19 dis­rupted some of our sup­ply chains ear­lier this year”.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore and Shan­dong can build on this mo­men­tum and fur­ther strengthen our col­lab­o­ra­tion in the ar­eas of trade and con­nec­tiv­ity, mod­ern ser­vices, sus­tain­abil­ity and peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­changes,” Mr Chee said af­ter his di­a­logue with Shan­dong pro­vin­cial party sec­re­tary Liu Ji­ayi at the Shan­dong-Asean Cross Bor­der Busi­ness Con­nect event on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Chee said he and Mr Liu “en­cour­aged Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies to con­tinue in­vest­ing in Shan­dong (and) for Shan­dong com­pa­nies to grow their pres­ence in Sin­ga­pore and ex­pand into South-east Asia by us­ing Sin­ga­pore as a re­gional hub”.</p>
    <p>He added that he will fo­cus on iden­ti­fy­ing new growth op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore and Shan­dong com­pa­nies as co-chair of the Sin­ga­pore-Shan­dong Busi­ness Coun­cil meet­ing in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>An­other pri­or­ity is to im­prove “peo­ple-to-peo­ple link­ages when the sit­u­a­tion al­lows, so that we can both emerge stronger from this pan­demic”.</p>
    <p>An En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) state­ment last year said that a po­ten­tial area for growth be­tween Shan­dong and Sin­ga­pore is in trad­ing food prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>“Shan­dong is the lead­ing agri­cul­tural prov­ince in China, and the top ex­porter of agri­cul­tural pro­duce to Sin­ga­pore among the Chi­nese prov­inces,” the state­ment said, adding that key prod­ucts ex­ported to Sin­ga­pore in­clude ap­ples, pears and Chi­nese cab­bage.</p>
    <p>“There is op­por­tu­nity for Sin­ga­pore traders and dis­trib­u­tors to im­port a wider range of pro­duce from Shan­dong that are in de­mand in Sin­ga­pore, es­pe­cially pre­mium fruits and veg­eta­bles such as cher­ries and black gar­lic,” the ESG state­ment said.</p>
