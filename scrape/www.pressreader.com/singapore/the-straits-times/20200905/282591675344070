    <p>Lionel Messi ended in­tense spec­u­la­tion about his fu­ture yes­ter­day by say­ing that he will re­main with Barcelona for an­other year – but only be­cause he did not want to en­ter a court bat­tle with the Span­ish club about his con­tract.</p>
    <p>The Ar­gen­tinian six-time world player of the year had told the La Liga club last month that he wanted to leave, in­sist­ing that a clause in his con­tract al­lowed him to do so on a free trans­fer.</p>
    <p>Barcelona, backed by La Liga, have in­sisted that a €700 mil­lion (S$1.12 bil­lion) re­lease clause would have to be paid.</p>
    <p>“I wasn’t happy and I wanted to leave. I have not been al­lowed this in any way and I will stay at the club so as not to get into a le­gal dis­pute. The man­age­ment of the club led by (pres­i­dent Josep Maria) Bar­tomeu is a dis­as­ter,” Messi told web­site Goal.com.</p>
    <p>“There was an­other way and it was to go to trial,” he added. “I would never go to court against Barca be­cause it is the club that I love, which gave me ev­ery­thing since I ar­rived. It is the club of my life, I have made my life here.</p>
    <p>“Barca gave me ev­ery­thing and I gave it ev­ery­thing. I thought and was sure that I was free to leave. The pres­i­dent al­ways said that at the end of the sea­son, I could de­cide if I stayed or not.</p>
    <p>“Now they cling to the fact that I did not say it be­fore June 10, when it turns out that on June 10 we were com­pet­ing for La Liga in the mid­dle of this aw­ful coro­n­avirus and this dis­ease al­tered all the sea­son.”</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old added: “When I com­mu­ni­cated my wish to leave to my wife and chil­dren, it was a bru­tal drama. The whole fam­ily be­gan cry­ing, my chil­dren did not want to leave Barcelona, nor did they want to change schools.”</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment was ironic given that just hours ear­lier, his fa­ther and agent, Jorge, had pub­lished a let­ter sent to La Liga dis­miss­ing its claim that the re­lease clause in Messi’s con­tract still ap­plied if he were to leave Barcelona and join a ri­val club.</p>
    <p>La Liga had re­leased a state­ment last Sun­day say­ing his con­tract was still valid, days af­ter his shock an­nounce­ment that he wanted to leave the club in the close sea­son and hours af­ter he failed to at­tend a pre-sea­son med­i­cal test.</p>
    <p>Jorge claimed the re­lease clause was re­moved once the player took up the op­tion in his con­tract to leave for free, which Messi’s side be­lieve he did when he no­ti­fied Barca by buro­fax on Aug 25.</p>
    <p>“We do not know which con­tract they have an­a­lysed and on what ba­sis they have con­cluded it would have an ap­pli­ca­ble ‘ter­mi­na­tion clause’ in the event that the player de­cides to uni­lat­er­ally re­voke the con­tract af­ter the con­clu­sion of the 2019-20 sea­son,” Jorge wrote in a let­ter pub­lished on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>“This is due to an ob­vi­ous er­ror on your part... It is ob­vi­ous that the com­pen­sa­tion of €700 mil­lion, pro­vided for in the pre­vi­ous clause... does not ap­ply at all.”</p>
    <p>La Liga, how­ever, pro­duced a swift re­sponse to the state­ment, its stance re­main­ing the same, say­ing: “They have made a de­con­tex­tu­alised in­ter­pre­ta­tion and moved away from the lit­er­al­ity of the con­tract.” It re­it­er­ated that the clause is “ab­so­lutely valid”.</p>
    <p>The va­lid­ity of the re­lease clause in Messi’s con­tract is im­por­tant be­cause its ex­is­tence means he could be li­able to pay the amount him­self if he joined an­other club but lost a sub­se­quent le­gal bat­tle in court.</p>
    <p>Messi will now pre­pare to start the sea­son un­der new Barcelona coach Ron­ald Koe­man.</p>
    <p>When I com­mu­ni­cated my wish to leave to my wife and chil­dren, it was a bru­tal drama. The whole fam­ily be­gan cry­ing, my chil­dren did not want to leave Barcelona.</p>
