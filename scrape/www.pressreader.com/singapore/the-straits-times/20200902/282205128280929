    <p>Wall Street may have de­fied grav­ity overnight but lo­cal shares con­tin­ued to drift yes­ter­day as in­vestors fret­ted over ten­sions be­tween the United States and China, and more pan­demic con­cerns.</p>
    <p>The share-buy­ing frenzy in the US over­shad­owed much else with stocks rack­ing up their best monthly per­for­mance since April and the S&P 500’s best Au­gust since 1986. A surge in Ap­ple and Tesla stocks had a sim­i­lar ef­fect on the Nas­daq, which soared to more than 12,000 points.</p>
    <p>Dai­lyFX strate­gist Mar­garet Yang said that while the over­all trend for the Nas­daq re­mains bullish, the fear gauge or VIX has spiked above 30 – its high­est in six weeks.</p>
    <p>“This sug­gests the five-month­long stock rally may have run out of steam and is due for a tech­ni­cal pull­back,” she warned.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s mar­ket was gen­er­ally lack­lus­tre by con­trast with the Straits Times Index clos­ing at 2,538.55, up 6.04 points or 0.24 per cent on trade of 1.8 bil­lion shares worth $903.25 mil­lion. Losers pipped gain­ers 215 to 214.</p>
    <p>Bro­kers said med­i­cal-re­lated stocks such as Medtecs In­ter­na­tional, which makes hospi­tal ap­parel and ban­dages, drew some in­ter­est. The stock closed up 1.97 per cent at $1.55 with around 14.3 mil­lion shares chang­ing hands. QT Vas­cu­lar, which pro­vides so­lu­tions for min­i­mally in­va­sive treat­ment of com­plex vas­cu­lar dis­eases, was the se­cond-most ac­tively traded stock, with 142.5 mil­lion shares traded. It was down 14.29 per cent at 1.2 cents. Malaysian glove maker Top Glove was among the ad­vancers, ris­ing 1.41 per cent to $8.66.</p>
    <p>Con­tract man­u­fac­turer Ven­ture rode on the tail­wind of the US tech rally, adding 0.55 per cent to $19.96.</p>
    <p>Prop­erty coun­ters, in­clud­ing City De­vel­op­ments, Ho­tel Royal and</p>
    <p>UOL, ben­e­fited from the cut in devel­op­ment charge rates, with the big­gest change for ho­tels and com­mer­cial prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>Re­gional mar­kets were sim­i­larly lack­lus­tre. Tokyo was flat as was Hong Kong. South Korea rose 1.01 per cent af­ter the govern­ment un­veiled ag­gres­sive spend­ing steps to blunt dam­age from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But main­land Chi­nese mar­kets were lifted by data show­ing an uptick in fac­tory ac­tiv­ity, with the Shang­hai Com­pos­ite Index ris­ing 0.44 per cent and Shen­zhen Com­pos­ite Index adding 0.67 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Aus­tralian shares closed at their low­est in nearly a month, with the S&P/ASX 200 end­ing 1.8 per cent down as sup­port from the cen­tral bank failed to calm in­vestors.</p>
