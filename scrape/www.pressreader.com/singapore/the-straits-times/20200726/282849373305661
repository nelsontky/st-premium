    <p>Fi­nan­cial ex­ec­u­tive Manish Ti­bre­wal reck­ons in­vest­ing in prop­erty makes a whole lot of sense when you do not have a lot of time on your hands and there are reg­u­la­tory is­sues to weigh up.</p>
    <p>Mr Ti­bre­wal, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Maitri As­set Man­age­ment, also buys into the tried and true con­ven­tion that lo­ca­tion is key to mak­ing money in real es­tate.</p>
    <p>“An as­set should be l ocated where there is scope for ap­pre­ci­a­tion ei­ther due to its rar­ity value or en­hance­ments in the vicin­ity,” he says.</p>
    <p>Mr Ti­bre­wal, whose prop­erty as­sets are largely in Sin­ga­pore and In­dia, moved here in 2009.</p>
    <p>His role at Maitri, which was founded as the To­laram Group’s fam­ily of­fice in 2015 be­fore evolv­ing into a li­censed as­set man­ager last year, in­volves help­ing clients pre­serve their wealth by cre­at­ing long-term, sus­tain­able in­vest­ments and gen­er­at­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for cap­i­tal ap­pre­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The firm’s fo­cus is to work with clients who want to set up a fam­ily of­fice here, Mr Ti­bre­wal says, not­ing that the many reg­u­la­tory and eco­nomic in­cen­tive schemes sup­ported by the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore and the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board make the Repub­lic a prime lo­ca­tion for such ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>It is no sur­prise that the 39-yearold In­dian na­tional, who is mar­ried and has two daugh­ters aged eight and two, firmly be­lieves that peo­ple should start sav­ing and in­vest­ing as early as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>He quotes Al­bert Ein­stein’s com­ments on com­pound in­ter­est: “He who un­der­stands it, earns it. He who doesn’t pays it.”</p>
    <p>This ap­plies not just to in­ter­est in­come but any form of in­vest­ment, Mr Ti­bre­wal notes, adding: “The ear­lier you start in­vest­ing, the big­ger the cor­pus of your sav­ings will be.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ti­bre­wal, who is also trea­surer for the Ro­tary Club of Sin­ga­pore, learnt the value of sav­ing as a child, when he wanted his own cam­era and was told by his fa­ther that he could buy one when he started earn­ing his own money.</p>
    <p>It spurred him to put aside some of his pocket money in a fixed de­posit ac­count, even­tu­ally sav­ing enough in 18 months to buy the cam­era.</p>
    <p>“This was my dad’s way of teach­ing me the tenets of sav­ing.”</p>
    <p>Q What’s in your per­sonal port­fo­lio? A The ma­jor­ity of my port­fo­lio is in real es­tate, fol­lowed by blue-chip eq­ui­ties and high-grade fixed in­come. I also have some smaller in­vest­ments in tech and health­care start-ups.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, I in­vest mostly in the United States and China – the world’s largest economies, which gen­er­ate many of the best in­no­va­tions.</p>
    <p>My av­er­age an­nual re­turn is in the mid-teens; how­ever, I de­ploy lev­er­age on my real es­tate port­fo­lio and much of it is un­re­alised as I have not yet sold the bulk of those as­sets.</p>
    <p>Blue-chip eq­ui­ties have also pro­vided good re­turns. My mantra for eq­ui­ties is to treat them like real es­tate – just be­cause they can be bought and sold ev­ery day does not mean we should be trad­ing them.</p>
    <p>My strat­egy is to iden­tify the sec­tor lead­ers with long-term growth, buy those com­pa­nies and hold on to them for at least five years.</p>
    <p>That said, these should be mon­i­tored, in case a gov­er­nance or any other is­sue crops up, and man­aged ac­cord­ingly.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, do not be tempted to sell to book prof­its early as some of those com­pa­nies could turn out to be multi­bag­gers.</p>
    <p>Q De­scribe your in­vest­ment strat­egy.</p>
    <p>A My strat­egy is very sim­ple. I ask my­self: “Am I get­ting value for the price I am pay­ing?” If the an­swer is yes, I do my re­search, due dili­gence and con­sider in­vest­ing.</p>
    <p>That said, ar­riv­ing at the right value is not that sim­ple. It is more of an art than a sci­ence.</p>
    <p>Q What are your im­me­di­ate in­vest­ment plans?</p>
    <p>A I do not have any im­me­di­ate plans to make sig­nif­i­cant changes to my per­sonal port­fo­lio as it is de­signed from a long-term per­spec­tive.</p>
    <p>I am also cur­rently more oc­cu­pied in think­ing about my clients’ port­fo­lios in an en­vi­ron­ment of height­ened volatil­ity and un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>Q How did you get in­ter­ested in in­vest­ing?</p>
    <p>A I come from a busi­ness fam­ily, so in many ways, in­vest­ing is in my DNA – I grew up learn­ing about busi­ness and in­vest­ing.</p>
    <p>I en­joyed help­ing my fa­ther with his busi­ness, which traded cot­ton and tex­tiles, dur­ing my school hol­i­days. I learnt to tackle real-world is­sues, when I was 13 to 14 years old, that ex­panded my ed­u­ca­tion be­yond text­books.</p>
    <p>My ex­pe­ri­ence grow­ing up also showed me the ef­fort that goes into earn­ing money and taught me not to take my priv­i­lege for granted.</p>
    <p>Look­ing back, I think this is what led me to study ac­count­ing and fi­nance.</p>
    <p>Q What else is in your fi­nan­cial plan?</p>
    <p>A Other than pro­vid­ing a good ed­u­ca­tion, I do not in­tend to put money aside for my chil­dren.</p>
    <p>I firmly be­lieve in giv­ing back to so­ci­ety and a good por­tion of my legacy will be ear­marked for help­ing the un­der­priv­i­leged.</p>
    <p>A United Na­tions study showed that more than 60 mil­lion chil­dren do not have ac­cess to pri­mary ed­u­ca­tion and another 200 mil­lion never reach sec­ondary school.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion is the best way to al­le­vi­ate fam­i­lies from the vi­cious cir­cle of poverty and, there­fore, I am very pas­sion­ate about chil­dren’s ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Q How are you plan­ning for re­tire­ment?</p>
    <p>A My port­fo­lio is cur­rently slanted to­wards cap­i­tal ap­pre­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>As I move to­wards re­tire­ment age, I will tweak it to gen­er­ate reg­u­lar in­come, which some of my real es­tate in­vest­ments are al­ready do­ing for me.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing re­tire­ment, I would like to im­merse my­self in vol­un­teer­ing work, as I find get­ting hands-on is more grat­i­fy­ing for me than just writ­ing some­one a cheque.</p>
    <p>Q What does money mean to you?</p>
    <p>A It may be a cliche, but I do be­lieve that money is a means to an end and not the end it­self.</p>
    <p>I also be­lieve that if I am more for­tu­nate than many oth­ers, and if I am able to im­prove the lives of oth­ers with the money I have, I am morally obliged to do my part.</p>
    <p>If I can bring a smile to the faces of even a few peo­ple with the re­sources at my dis­posal, I would be very happy.</p>
    <p>Q Home is now...</p>
    <p>A A three-bed­room apart­ment in Tan­jong Rhu.</p>
    <p>Q I drive...</p>
    <p>A A black BMW 520i.</p>
