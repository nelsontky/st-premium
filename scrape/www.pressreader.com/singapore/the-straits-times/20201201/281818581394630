    <p>BANGKOK Twit­ter has sus­pended a Thai pro-roy­al­ist ac­count linked to the palace that a Reuters anal­y­sis found was con­nected to thou­sands of others cre­ated in re­cent weeks and spread­ing posts in favour of King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn and the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>The Reuters re­view found tens of thou­sands of tweets that an ex­pert said ap­peared to be from ac­counts am­pli­fy­ing roy­al­ist mes­sag­ing in a push to counter a months-long protest move­ment that has swelled from op­pos­ing the gov­ern­ment to break­ing a long­stand­ing taboo by chal­leng­ing the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>In­ter­nal army train­ing doc­u­ments re­viewed by Reuters showed ev­i­dence of a co­or­di­nated in­for­ma­tion cam­paign de­signed to spread favourable in­for­ma­tion and dis­credit op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>The pro-monar­chy @ji­tarsa-school ac­count was sus­pended af­ter Reuters sought com­ment last Wed­nes­day from Twit­ter on the re­cent roy­al­ist cam­paign on the so­cial me­dia plat­form, where pro­test­ers have long had a strong pres­ence.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers and roy­al­ists have cited the im­por­tance of so­cial me­dia in pro­pel­ling the protest move­ment, which has be­come the big­gest chal­lenge in decades to the monar­chy as well as the gov­ern­ment of for­mer junta leader Prayut Chan-o-cha.</p>
    <p>Cre­ated in Septem­ber, the @ji­tarsa-school ac­count had more than 48,000 fol­low­ers be­fore its sus­pen­sion.</p>
    <p>“The ac­count in ques­tion was sus­pended for vi­o­lat­ing our rules on spam and plat­form ma­nip­u­la­tion,” a Twit­ter rep­re­sen­ta­tive said on Sun­day. She said the sus­pen­sion was in line with the com­pany’s poli­cies and not a re­sult of the Reuters re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>The ac­count’s pro­file said it trained peo­ple for the Royal Vol­un­teers pro­gramme run by the Royal Of­fice.</p>
    <p>A Face­book page for the Royal Vol­un­teers School, which posts pro-monar­chy videos and news of the pro­gramme, iden­ti­fies the Twit­ter ac­count as its own.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther the school nor the Royal Vol­un­teers head­quar­ters re­sponded to re­quests for com­ment on the sus­pen­sion. The “Vol­un­teer Spirit 904” pro­gramme was es­tab­lished dur­ing the cur­rent king’s reign, which be­gan in 2016, to build loy­alty to the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>The palace did not re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>In re­cent weeks, roy­al­ist hash­tags have be­gun trend­ing on Twit­ter, an im­por­tant plat­form for op­po­nents of the gov­ern­ment even be­fore protests be­gan in July.</p>
    <p>The Reuters anal­y­sis found that more than 80 per cent of the ac­counts fol­low­ing @ji­tarsa-school were cre­ated since the start of Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>A sam­ple of 4,600 of the re­cently cre­ated ac­counts showed that all they did was pro­mote the roy­al­ist hash­tags – an in­di­ca­tion of the kind of ac­tiv­ity that would not be as­so­ci­ated with reg­u­lar Twit­ter users.</p>
    <p>“Gov­ern­ment forces have been try­ing to counter the pro­test­ers,” said Ms Sai­jai Liang­pun­sakul of the in­de­pen­dent So­cial Me­dia Mon­i­tor­ing for Peace group.</p>
    <p>“Twit­ter has taken down some ac­counts, but there are many more.”</p>
    <p>Roy­al­ist group leader Warong Dechgitvi­grom de­clined to com­ment on the ac­count’s sus­pen­sion, say­ing he was un­aware of it.</p>
    <p>He said there were more pro-monar­chy mes­sages on Twit­ter be­cause roy­al­ists in­creas­ingly recog­nised the need to counter pro­test­ers’ mes­sages and had en­cour­aged each an­other to join the plat­form.</p>
    <p>Roy­al­ists have ac­cused pro­test­ers of in­au­then­tic ac­tiv­ity on Twit­ter, with co­or­di­nated cam­paigns around hash­tags.</p>
    <p>But Mr Parit “Pen­guin” Chi­warak, one of the protest lead­ers, said pro­test­ers us­ing the plat­form were gen­uine and he wel­comed the sus­pen­sion of the pro-roy­al­ist ac­count.</p>
    <p>Al­though not di­rectly linked to the @ji­tarsa-school ac­count, a 28-page army doc­u­ment re­viewed by Reuters showed an or­gan­ised in­for­ma­tion op­er­a­tion to tar­get “op­po­nents” and spread pro-monar­chy mes­sages on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>The army last Satur­day ac­knowl­edged that the doc­u­ment is gen­uine, say­ing in a Face­book post it was used in a train­ing ses­sion to strengthen the army’s pub­lic re­la­tions ef­forts.</p>
