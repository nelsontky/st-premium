    <p>• Le­ices­ter City striker Jamie Vardy and play­maker James Mad­di­son are likely to be rested for to­day’s FA Cup thir­dround clash at Stoke City to al­low them to fully re­cover from in­juries, man­ager Brendan Rodgers has said.</p>
    <p>Vardy, Le­ices­ter’s top scorer this sea­son with 13 goals in all com­pe­ti­tions, is bat­tling a nig­gling hip prob­lem, while Mad­di­son, who has scored six goals and pro­vided six as­sists, is car­ry­ing a knee in­jury. Both play­ers did not train this week.</p>
    <p>“Both of (them) have done re­ally well to get through these last num­ber of games be­cause they’ve been car­ry­ing some in­juries,” Rodgers told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“This may be an op­por­tu­nity for us to let them re­cover and then be ready af­ter the week­end... Be­cause of the close­ness of the games, they haven’t been able to have the re­cov­ery pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“We’re hav­ing to look at where we can do that, for the ben­e­fit of the short and the longer term. So this is prob­a­bly go­ing to be the week­end where they miss out.”</p>
    <p>Rodgers said de­fender Ri­cardo Pereira will also miss the game as he re­cov­ers from a groin is­sue, while new re­cruit Cen­giz Un­der will need to be as­sessed af­ter pick­ing up an an­kle in­jury.</p>
    <p>Ahead of the clash against the Cham­pi­onship side, the Foxes boss also spoke highly of Stoke man­ager Michael O’Neill.</p>
    <p>The pair grew up in the same town in North­ern Ire­land, played for the same ju­nior team, al­beit four years apart, and have known each other for more than three decades.</p>
    <p>Rodgers, 46, started coach­ing be­fore 51-year-old O’Neill, who was still play­ing, but the for­mer said he had a lot of re­spect for his com­pa­triot.</p>
    <p>“I know Michael well,” he said. “He’s a few years older than me and played for the Star United team that I played for in Bal­ly­mena as well... and he went to St Louis’ Gram­mar School in Bal­ly­mena, I went to St Pa­trick’s, so I was aware of Michael i n my teenage years.</p>
    <p>“He had an ex­cel­lent ca­reer as a player and was al­ways go­ing to be suc­cess­ful in what­ever he went into.</p>
    <p>“I have a huge ad­mi­ra­tion for Michael. He’s a good man and he’s done an ex­cel­lent job since he’s gone into Stoke as well.”</p>
