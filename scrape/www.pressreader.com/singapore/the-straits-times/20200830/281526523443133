    <p>Around the world, lives are put on pause. Some have been punc­tured.</p>
    <p>In the United States, the on­set of Septem­ber – usu­ally a time of fresh beginnings as Amer­i­cans re­turn from sum­mer hol­i­days, and schools open for a new aca­demic year – is stalked by the smell of fear in­stead. New waves of Covid-19 cases could rise and over­whelm the coun­try.</p>
    <p>An­other epi­demic of death and chaos is brew­ing. Vi­o­lent protests and counter-protests are heav­ing in Wis­con­sin fol­low­ing yet an­other po­lice shoot­ing of a black Amer­i­can.</p>
    <p>All this, amid a par­tic­u­larly toxic pres­i­den­tial elec­tion ped­dling in racism and per­sonal at­tacks.</p>
    <p>Else­where, the news is equally grim.</p>
    <p>The brit­tle peace process in Afghanista­n is giv­ing way to a se­ries of at­tacks that have left 12 dead and many more wounded. Ten­sions are ris­ing in the Tai­wan Strait, with China and the US eye­balling each other across war­ships and fighter jets in mul­ti­ple mil­i­tary ex­er­cises.</p>
    <p>In Hong Kong, a man who had re­cov­ered from Covid-19 was in­fected again months later, in the first doc­u­mented case of hu­man re­in­fec­tion. It un­der­scores how the dis­ease, which has killed more than 800,000 peo­ple world­wide, will not be stopped in its tracks any time soon.</p>
    <p>What about in Sin­ga­pore?</p>
    <p>The econ­omy shrank 6.7 per cent in the first half of this year. Some 10,000 peo­ple have lost their jobs and the num­ber will cer­tainly es­ca­late. An­other 240,000 saw their salaries slashed.</p>
    <p>Banyan Tree, Boe­ing, dnata,</p>
    <p>Ea­gle Ser­vices Asia, Go­jek, Grab, Mil­len­nium Ho­tels and Re­sorts, Pratt & Whit­ney, Re­sorts World Sen­tosa, Rolls-Royce, Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings and Sun­tec Sin­ga­pore are just some of the big com­pa­nies that have had to re­trench work­ers so far.</p>
    <p>On the ground, smaller busi­nesses – from nail par­lours and restau­rants to trad­ing firms – have also qui­etly let go of work­ers as they shut­ter.</p>
    <p>But the sta­tis­tics and the re­ports do not fully re­flect the broader sense of anx­i­ety and fore­bod­ing.</p>
    <p>Un­like re­ces­sions that are part of eco­nomic cy­cles and whose out­lines are thus more fa­mil­iar to pol­i­cy­mak­ers and busi­ness lead­ers, the Covid-19 cri­sis is pro­pelled by a still largely un­known dis­ease whose beginnings re­main shrouded in mys­tery and whose end no one can tell. When will it end? How will it end? Will it end?</p>
    <p>In this time of ques­tions with­out an­swers, so­ci­eties are un­der great stress.</p>
    <p>Stud­ies have found that hu­mans hate un­cer­tainty so much that they will rather choose a bad but cer­tain out­come over an un­cer­tain but pos­si­bly good one.</p>
    <p>In an ar­ti­cle in The At­lantic, au­thor Eric Weiner cited a Bri­tish study that found that par­tic­i­pants ex­pe­ri­enced greater stress when they had a 50 per cent chance of re­ceiv­ing an elec­tric shock than when they had a 100 per cent chance.</p>
    <p>“In­tol­er­ance for un­cer­tainty puts peo­ple at greater risk for ail­ments sch as de­pres­sion and ob­ses­sive-com­pul­sive dis­or­der,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>A former col­league M. Nir­mala, who runs Child at Street 11, a child­care cen­tre in Ang Mo Kio for kids from dis­ad­van­taged fam­i­lies, says she sees more chil­dren hav­ing to cope with par­ents los­ing their jobs and wor­ried about putting food on the ta­ble or pay­ing for school fees. “There is a loss of se­cu­rity and the hap­pi­ness that they had be­fore the cri­sis,” she says.</p>
    <p>While politi­cians and pol­i­cy­mak­ers do their ut­most to mit­i­gate its im­pact with im­por­tant, con­crete mea­sures – aid, hand­outs, skills train­ing, job cre­ation and the court­ing of in­vest­ments – there is some­thing else sorely needed.</p>
    <p>In these night­mar­ish times, we need dreams. Vi­sions that will lift us above cur­rent-day chal­lenges, and en­cap­su­late the hope that takes us for­ward. Such dreams are even more pow­er­ful when they are not just in­di­vid­ual as­pi­ra­tions, but a na­tional dream that the coun­try iden­ti­fies with and shares.</p>
    <p>THE GOOD LIFE</p>
    <p>The idea of a Sin­ga­pore Dream sounds al­most quaint nowa­days.</p>
    <p>A catch­phrase es­pe­cially in the late 1980s and 1990s, it was dis­cussed in Par­lia­ment, the­atre plays and news­pa­per ar­ti­cles. In the last decade though, the term fell out of vogue, even as the orig­i­nal dream it was ref­er­enced from – the Amer­i­can Dream – con­tin­ues to evolve and be up­dated in the US.</p>
    <p>Last year, the Amer­i­can En­ter­prise In­sti­tute is­sued a re­port, based on a sur­vey it con­ducted with re­search cen­tre NORC at the Univer­sity of Chicago. Re­spon­dents across the de­mo­graphic and po­lit­i­cal spec­trum were asked what was key to the Amer­i­can Dream.</p>
    <p>Sur­pris­ingly, just less than half cited so­cial mo­bil­ity, with 45 per cent se­lect­ing “to have a bet­ter qual­ity of life than your par­ents”, while 49 per cent said a suc­cess­ful ca­reer. Even fewer – only 16 per cent – said that be­com­ing wealthy was part of the Amer­i­can Dream.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the vast ma­jor­ity – 85 per cent – chose “freedom of choice in how to live”. A sim­i­lar pro­por­tion – 83 per cent – said that “a good family life” was es­sen­tial.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Sa­muel J.</p>
    <p>Abrams, who led the study, wrote in The New York Times that the re­search shows that the Amer­i­can Dream to­day is less about ma­te­rial suc­cess and so­cial mo­bil­ity. “The Amer­i­can Dream car­ries wider no­tions of stand­ing up for in­di­vid­ual and com­mu­nity rights,” he said. “I am pleased to re­port that the Amer­i­can Dream is alive and well for an over­whelm­ing ma­jor­ity of Amer­i­cans.”</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, we too have moved be­yond mere ma­te­rial pur­suits.</p>
    <p>One early it­er­a­tion of the Sin­ga­pore Dream, which ap­peared in a 1981 Sun­day Times ar­ti­cle, de­fined it as: “A salary of a few thou­sand dol­lars a month; enough extra cash to dec­o­rate the home with the lat­est equip­ment and branded fab­rics and fur­ni­ture; hol­i­days abroad; two chil­dren and a prom­ise for the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>And while the early Amer­i­can Dream fea­tured a house with a lawn and a white picket fence, the Sin­ga­pore Dream was re­fined in the 1990s to com­prise the five Cs – cash, car, con­do­minium, credit cards and coun­try club mem­ber­ships.</p>
    <p>They are crass to to­day’s ears but it was a dream in a time when bet­ter­ing their lives ma­te­ri­ally was cen­tre stage for most Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Since then, there have been some at­tempts to up­date the Sin­ga­pore Dream. In 2009, the Na­tional</p>
    <p>Pop­u­la­tion Sec­re­tar­iat pro­posed an al­ter­na­tive term, the Sin­ga­pore Prom­ise: Sin­ga­pore will be the best place to live, work and play for all who share the ethos of mer­i­toc­racy and in­clu­sive­ness.</p>
    <p>More re­cently, in 2015, Mr Ho Kwon Ping made a pow­er­ful speech about how the Sin­ga­pore Dream – the be­lief that Sin­ga­pore is a land of op­por­tu­ni­ties where one can achieve per­sonal and family dreams, and pur­sue a life of mean­ing and pur­pose – can be kept alive.</p>
    <p>He spoke of the ur­gent need to do away with out­dated la­bels that divide Sin­ga­pore­ans; pro­mote so­cial lev­el­ling; and re­dress in­for­ma­tion asym­me­try so that Sin­ga­pore­ans can ro­bustly en­gage in a par­tic­i­pa­tory democ­racy.</p>
    <p>Of the three, there has been some at­tempt by the Govern­ment since to work on restart­ing so­cial mo­bil­ity and dis­man­tling closed cir­cles.</p>
    <p>EV­ERY DREAM A GOOD DREAM?</p>
    <p>To­day, though, few talk about the Sin­ga­pore Dream, in what­ever shape or form. An in­for­mal poll of friends sug­gests that there are in­di­vid­ual Sin­ga­pore dreams.</p>
    <p>One ar­tic­u­lated ma­te­rial goals: a landed house, a nice car (prefer­ably two), two kids (in good schools), a dog, as well as in­vest­ment prop­erty to gen­er­ate side in­come.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers say they are not in­ter­ested in ma­te­rial pos­ses­sions, but ac­knowl­edge that fi­nan­cial com­fort will be key to achiev­ing their as­pi­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>“It’s about be­ing able to do what one wants, when one wants to do it – for ex­am­ple, take a six-month sab­bat­i­cal as and when – with­out wor­ry­ing about fi­nances,” says one.</p>
    <p>An­other says: “For me, the dream is to be able to pur­sue op­por­tu­ni­ties that the heart de­sires, and to age with grace and dig­nity.”</p>
    <p>A younger col­league shares: “I think that the Sin­ga­porean Dream is to travel and col­lect ex­pe­ri­ences world­wide. The more ex­otic or the rarer, the more en­rich­ing or ‘suc­cess­ful’ those ex­pe­ri­ences are.”</p>
    <p>Some want au­ton­omy over their lives: They want to opt out of the cor­po­rate rat race, be in­flu­encers, re­tire at age 30, live over­seas.</p>
    <p>An­other friend shared sim­ply this: a vi­sion of a Sin­ga­pore that is equal and open.</p>
    <p>There is an in­choate long­ing for some­thing to look for­ward to, post-pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But most are hard put to ar­tic­u­late a Sin­ga­pore Dream, or to even say if we have one to­day.</p>
    <p>Per­haps it is be­cause we are such a di­verse so­ci­ety that we find it dif­fi­cult to en­vis­age a com­mon vi­sion that this coun­try can move to­wards. Per­haps the lack of a col­lec­tive as­pi­ra­tion is be­cause no leader – po­lit­i­cal or cul­tural – has raised it in re­cent times and swept the so­ci­ety up in it, but might it be time for a ground-up con­ver­sa­tion that helps us make con­crete the val­ues we hold as im­por­tant?</p>
    <p>Per­haps the Sin­ga­pore Dream is one that en­com­passes many Sin­ga­pore dreams, as would be nat­u­ral in a so­ci­ety as di­verse as ours. Maybe, ev­ery dream is a good dream – and every­one gets a fair shot at achiev­ing them.</p>
    <p>But these dis­parate dreams must be bound by a sense of shared destiny. What can this com­mon thread be?</p>
    <p>One can­di­date, for me, is the idea of civic ethos, which me­dia aca­demic Che­rian Ge­orge out­lined at an In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies con­fer­ence in 2018, when dis­cussing how Sin­ga­pore can man­age its di­ver­sity. Such an ethos is one “where peo­ple’s no­tion of the good life and a good so­ci­ety fac­tors in the well-be­ing of oth­ers, in­clud­ing peo­ple very dif­fer­ent from them­selves”.</p>
    <p>This world­view, he said, can be seen when lead­ers and mem­bers of a ma­jor­ity faith instinctiv­ely rise in de­fence of mi­nor­ity re­li­gions that are un­der at­tack.</p>
    <p>Or when peo­ple are will­ing to sup­port higher per­sonal in­come taxes if it means that their chil­dren can grow up in a more civilised en­vi­ron­ment with more so­cial jus­tice and less poverty.</p>
    <p>I heard a hint of this ethos in Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam’s com­ments last month when he called for a new so­cial com­pact.</p>
    <p>“We have to go back to a sense of moral pur­pose in govern­ment, hav­ing the con­fi­dence to con­vince the pop­u­la­tion that these are the right things to do – and we’re all go­ing to have to or­gan­ise our­selves to­gether to achieve it – and an abil­ity to fo­cus the re­sources of the state on what mat­ters most, rather than ev­ery­thing,” he said then.</p>
    <p>So what mat­ters most and who should pay for it? He spoke of the con­cept of fair­ness: While every­one should con­trib­ute some­thing more as so­ci­eties get older, “fair­ness dic­tates that things have to stack up in favour of the poor and the mid­dle in­come”.</p>
    <p>In her ad­dress last Mon­day, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob al­luded to the need to build a fair and just so­ci­ety. When talk­ing about a Sin­ga­pore Dream, that could be a good place to start.</p>
