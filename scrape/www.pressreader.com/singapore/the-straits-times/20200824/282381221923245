    <p>When news broke of Bel­la­graph Nova (BN) Group’s bid to take over New­cas­tle United, David Alexan­der was ex­cited at the prospect of fel­low Sin­ga­pore­ans own­ing the English Pre­mier League club he sup­ports.</p>
    <p>The 44-year-old co-founded the New­cas­tle United Sup­port­ers Club Singapore (NUFCSG) in 2000 and it now has about 1,300 mem­bers.</p>
    <p>How­ever, like many mem­bers of the Toon Army, he was al­ready “ex­pect­ing the worst” as there have been mul­ti­ple failed takeover bids for the Mag­pies. The BN Group is the sixth group linked with a takeover since the club was of­fi­cially put on sale by Bri­tish owner Mike Ashley in Oc­to­ber 2017.</p>
    <p>“It’s nice to have our fel­low Sin­ga­pore­ans raising a bid and show­ing an in­ter­est to in­vest in our beloved foot­ball club,” said Alexan­der.</p>
    <p>“But hon­estly, I had zero ex­pec­ta­tions be­cause we have so many takeover bids and en­quiries.</p>
    <p>“The lat­est one was the very big one from Saudi (Ara­bia’s Pub­lic In­vest­ment Fund) but every­thing dragged on and noth­ing ma­te­ri­alised. I was very dis­ap­pointed in the out­come.”</p>
    <p>He is not alone in his scep­ti­cism. Event pro­ducer Jonathan DrapeComyn is a life-long Mag­pies fan but is no longer as in­vested in foot­ball af­ter 13 years of lead­er­ship un­der Ashley and nu­mer­ous takeover ru­mours. The New­cas­tle na­tive used to at­tend every game be­fore he moved to Singapore last March.</p>
    <p>But the 25-year-old told The Straits Times: “I’ve be­come am­biva­lent to­wards the ac­tual foot­ball and I won’t stay up till 3am to watch matches... We want our club to be for the peo­ple and the city, not a rich per­son’s play toy.”</p>
    <p>So when the BN Group an­nounced a bid for the club last week, Drape-Comyn was “im­me­di­ately scep­ti­cal” af­ter “13 years of ru­mours and po­ten­tial takeovers”.</p>
    <p>And he was even more so af­ter Reuters re­ported on Satur­day that BN Group had doc­tored pho­to­graphs of former United States pres­i­dent Barack Obama in its publicity ma­te­ri­als, while raising other ques­tions about the group’s cre­den­tials, such as not be­ing reg­is­tered in France even though it said its head­quar­ters are in Paris.</p>
    <p>The group was founded by Sin­ga­porean cousins Ter­ence and Nel­son Loh and Chi­nese jew­ellery mer­chant Evan­ge­line Shen.</p>
    <p>When the BN Group an­nounced its bid, Drape-Comyn went to check out its reg­is­tered Singapore ad­dress at a four-storey build­ing in Novena on Satur­day and tweeted: “Turns out it’s ac­tu­ally above one of my favourite restau­rants. They do a great Hor Fun (take­away equiv to beef in black bean sauce).”</p>
    <p>When asked if the BN Group had reached out to the lo­cal fan group, a com­mit­tee mem­ber of NUFCSG, Ter­ence Ong, said: “To the best of my knowl­edge, as well as that of the NUFCSG main com­mit­tee, we have not had con­tact with any­one about a pos­si­ble takeover of New­cas­tle United Foot­ball Club.”</p>
    <p>Alexan­der added: “Who­ever our new own­ers are, I hope they will in­vest in our club and bring us to the next level where we can hope­fully play against the best Euro­pean clubs again.”</p>
