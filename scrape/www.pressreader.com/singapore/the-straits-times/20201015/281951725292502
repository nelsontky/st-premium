    <p>Ap­ple fans in Sin­ga­pore can start to pre-or­der the new iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro tomorrow, fol­low­ing the global launch of the brand’s first 5G smart­phones yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Two other new 5G mod­els, the iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max, were also an­nounced yes­ter­day but pre-or­ders for them will open here only from Nov 6.</p>
    <p>At a vir­tual launch event yes­ter­day, Ap­ple chief ex­ec­u­tive Tim Cook said: “To­day is the begin­ning of a new era for iPhone. We are bring­ing 5G to iPhone.”</p>
    <p>The 6.1-inch iPhone 12 is priced from $1,299, while the 6.1-inch iPhone 12 Pro starts from $1,649. Both will be avail­able from Oct 23.</p>
    <p>The 5.4-inch iPhone 12 mini starts from $1,149, while the 6.7-inch iPhone 12 Pro Max will re­tail from $1,799. Both mod­els will be sold from Nov 13.</p>
    <p>What 5G tech­nol­ogy prom­ises are surf­ing speeds 20 times faster than what 4G net­works of­fer, and the abil­ity to con­nect 1,000 times as many de­vices.</p>
    <p>With Ap­ple join­ing ri­vals Sam­sung and Huawei on the 5G march, an­a­lysts are hope­ful that telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions com­pa­nies will quicken the pace of their 5G roll­outs.</p>
    <p>Mr Thomas Hus­son, prin­ci­pal an­a­lyst and vice-pres­i­dent of re­search firm For­rester, said: “Ap­ple will do more for 5G than 5G will do for the new iPhones.”</p>
    <p>He said that 5G is still a rel­a­tively im­ma­ture tech­nol­ogy glob­ally and has few new com­pelling con­sumer uses, one of which could be cloud gam­ing on the go.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, lo­cal tel­cos Sing­tel, StarHub and M1 are pro­vid­ing lim­ited 5G ser­vices on trial. StarHub was the first to do so in Au­gust, de­liv­er­ing 5G ser­vices over its ex­ist­ing 3G ra­dio-fre­quency band.</p>
    <p>New­comer TPG Tele­com is look­ing to launch 5G ser­vices. But it is still wait­ing for the reg­u­la­tor, the In­fo­comm Me­dia Devel­op­ment Author­ity (IMDA), to ap­prove its plans to use its 4G ra­dio-fre­quency bands, sup­ported by the new iPhone 12, to pro­vide 5G ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“We hope that the IMDA can do so be­fore the sale of the iPhone 12 so that we can run mar­ket tri­als like the rest of the op­er­a­tors in Sin­ga­pore and of­fer more choices to con­sumers,” said Mr Ben­jamin Tan, chief tech­nol­ogy of­fi­cer at TPG.</p>
    <p>While all the iPhone 12 mod­els sup­port most of the fre­quency bands used by tel­cos to pro­vide 5G ser­vices, the phones do not have the hard­ware com­po­nents to work on the faster mil­lime­tre wave spec­trum that will be widely used in Sin­ga­pore for 5G ser­vices.</p>
    <p>This did not dis­suade cy­ber-se­cu­rity ex­pert Shane Chi­ang, 48, from plan­ning to up­grade to the new phone.</p>
    <p>“Many ap­pli­ca­tions need faster down­load speeds. It helps to have a top-of-the-line phone and a faster net­work,” he said.</p>
    <p>The mo­bile phone sec­tor, like many oth­ers, was hit hard by the Covid-19 pan­demic and lock­downs in many markets. Con­sumers put off non-es­sen­tial pur­chases, fear­ing a re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Canalys senior an­a­lyst Ben Stan­ton said that 5G is a bright spark amid ef­forts in var­i­ous markets to restart their economies, fol­low­ing the lock­downs.</p>
    <p>“Global smart­phone ship­ments are re­bound­ing rapidly in many markets ahead of the eco­nomic and re­tail con­sump­tion re­cov­ery,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket re­search firm IDC has pro­jected that 481 mil­lion 5G smart­phones will ship next year, dou­ble the 237 mil­lion ex­pected this year.</p>
    <p>AP­PLE’S IM­PACT</p>
    <p>Ap­ple will do more for 5G than 5G will do for the new iPhones.</p>
