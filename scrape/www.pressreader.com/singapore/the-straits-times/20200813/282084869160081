    <p>The Sin­ga­porean-Ger­man Cham­ber of In­dus­try and Com­merce (SGC) has an­nounced plans to es­tab­lish a Plas­tics Re­cy­cling As­so­ci­a­tion and a Cen­tre of Ex­cel­lence for re­cy­cling here, with the even­tual goal of turn­ing Sin­ga­pore into a re­gional hub of ex­cel­lence in plas­tics re­cy­cling.</p>
    <p>This will in turn cre­ate more busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties and boost the econ­omy here, said the SGC.</p>
    <p>The plan, an­nounced dur­ing a vir­tual book launch yes­ter­day, will see Euro­pean ex­perts and com­pa­nies work­ing to­gether with lo­cal coun­ter­parts and govern­ment in­sti­tu­tions in the plas­tics re­cy­cling arena.</p>
    <p>The SGC’s sus­tain­abil­ity com­mit­tee chair­man Joachim Ihrcke un­veiled the plan at the vir­tual launch of Grun Book, which means “green book”. The text gives an over­view of Sin­ga­pore and Ger­many’s re­cy­cling and sus­tain­abil­ity jour­neys, and de­scribes the plan for Sin­ga­pore to be­come a re­gional hub in re­cy­cling.</p>
    <p>The launch was at­tended by Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu, who also wrote the book’s fore­word.</p>
    <p>Call­ing Sin­ga­pore and Ger­many “well placed” to help ad­dress waste chal­lenges faced in South-east Asia, Ms Fu said pur­su­ing sus­tain­abil­ity through adopt­ing in­no­va­tive pro­cesses will give busi­nesses a com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tage in the fu­ture econ­omy, and al­low them to res­onate with con­sumers who are in­creas­ingly en­vi­ron­men­tally con­scious.</p>
    <p>She said: “There is im­mense po­ten­tial for greater re­search and ex­changes in re­cy­cling, which will gen­er­ate eco­nomic op­por­tu­ni­ties and green jobs.”</p>
    <p>Re­cy­cling, par­tic­u­larly in the area of plas­tics, has long been a con­cern for land-scarce Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>It was re­ported last year that 949,300 tonnes of plas­tic waste was gen­er­ated here in 2018, but only 4 per cent was re­cy­cled. Of that amount, only 7 per cent was pro­cessed lo­cally, while the rest was sent over­seas.</p>
    <p>But coun­tries in the re­gion have be­gun shut­ting their doors to the world’s waste, with China ban­ning plas­tic im­ports and South-east Asian na­tions such as Thai­land and Viet­nam look­ing to fol­low suit.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties here have been look­ing for ways to ex­tend the life span of Se­makau Land­fill.</p>
    <p>Mr Ihrcke said yes­ter­day that the SGC plans to set up the Plas­tics Re­cy­cling As­so­ci­a­tion within two months, and be­gin dis­cus­sions on what kind of re­cy­cling projects it would like to em­bark on.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther de­tails were not dis­closed, but he added that the tar­get is to es­tab­lish the Cen­tre of Ex­cel­lence for re­cy­cling by the sec­ond quar­ter of next year, and set up a PET (poly­eth­yl­ene tereph­tha­late) bot­tle re­cy­cling plant here in the sec­ond quar­ter of 2022. If built, the plant will help re­searchers de­ter­mine how to adjust re­cy­cling so­lu­tions to meet needs in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>In its book, the SGC noted that the en­gage­ment of the lo­cal com­mu­nity is es­sen­tial for the suc­cess of the pilot plant. It said: “Once the so­lu­tions are suc­cess­fully im­ple­mented in Sin­ga­pore... (it) can in­vite other coun­tries to view the so­lu­tions, part­ner with them, and ex­port the prod­ucts and tech­nolo­gies in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>“As the de­mand in the re­gion for re­cy­cling so­lu­tions is im­mense, this will open var­i­ous op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­porean busi­nesses and boost the na­tion’s econ­omy.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ihrcke said he hopes the PET re­cy­cling plant will be the first of many projects to come.</p>
    <p>Ms Fu said: “Europe, Ger­many, Switzer­land and Aus­tria of­fer us many good learn­ing lessons. And we in­tend to learn from peo­ple that are ahead of us and have ap­plied some of the so­lu­tions.”</p>
    <p>She added: “That’s how Sin­ga­pore has al­ways been – learn broadly, learn widely, pick up what’s rel­e­vant and ap­ply (it) ef­fec­tively.”</p>
