    <p>BUENOS AIRES • Ar­gen­tinian football great Diego Maradona was in “ex­cel­lent” con­di­tion fol­low­ing surgery for a brain clot yes­ter­day, said his lawyer Ma­tias Morla.</p>
    <p>“The last med­i­cal re­port was ex­cel­lent,” he said. “Let’s stay strong and we’ll get through this.”</p>
    <p>Maradona, 60, was ad­mit­ted to hos­pi­tal a day ear­lier for an op­er­a­tion to ad­dress the clot, of­ten caused by a head in­jury and which can put pres­sure on the brain.</p>
    <p>“I was able to evac­u­ate the haematoma suc­cess­fully and Diego tol­er­ated the surgery very well,” Leopoldo Luque, Maradona’s neu­ro­sur­geon and per­sonal physi­cian, told re­porters out­side the clinic where fans were gath­ered.</p>
    <p>“The steps now are ob­ser­va­tion, but it is con­trolled. It will de­pend on how he does. It is not highly com­plex, but it is still brain surgery,” Luque added, say­ing the procedure had taken around 80 min­utes.</p>
    <p>The in­ter­ven­tion was po­ten­tially risky due to the for­mer foot­baller’s del­i­cate gen­eral health, though Luque ear­lier said the procedure was “rou­tine surgery” and that Maradona had been “lu­cid” and un­der­stood and agreed with the procedure.</p>
    <p>Maradona was ad­mit­ted to the Ipensa Clinic in La Plata, Ar­gentina, on Mon­day for anaemia and de­hy­dra­tion, be­fore be­ing trans­ferred to Olivos Clinic in Buenos Aires prov­ince.</p>
    <p>Around 50 fans gath­ered in front of the clinic, in the sub­urbs of the cap­i­tal Buenos Aires, cel­e­brated when re­ports of the suc­cess­ful out­come started to emerge, chant­ing: “Diego, Diego!”</p>
    <p>Maradona, who won the World Cup with Ar­gentina in 1986 and is widely con­sid­ered to be one of the greatest players of all time, coaches lo­cal club Gim­na­sia y Es­grima. He last ap­peared in public on his 60th birth­day last Fri­day be­fore his side’s league match against Pa­tronato.</p>
    <p>Dozens of fans from Gim­na­sia y Es­grima have con­verged on the hos­pi­tal since Mon­day evening, wav­ing flags and hold­ing posters with mes­sages of sup­port as they waited for news.</p>
    <p>“What we want the most is for Diego to get out of all this. He can be, he is the greatest, the greatest in the world,” said Diego Ber­mudez, 41, a Maradona fan wait­ing out­side the hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Another fan, Os­car Me­d­ina, said: “Diego is fight­ing in­side with medics. Hope­fully God blesses the medics, to move on from this. His peo­ple are out here on the street, hearts beat­ing.”</p>
