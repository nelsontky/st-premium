    <p>A total of 11,000 beds were built for Covid-19 pa­tients here with the help of the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces (SAF) and Min­istry of De­fence-re­lated or­gan­i­sa­tions, said De­fence Min­is­ter Ng Eng Hen.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the De­fence Schol­ar­ship Awards Cer­e­mony yes­ter­day, Dr Ng out­lined how SAF over­saw the two-month ef­fort that be­gan in April, which in­volved more than 6,000 per­son­nel led by gen­er­als and colonels.</p>
    <p>He also said Min­def pre-emp­tively or­dered 20,000 pulse oxime­ters – de­vices used to mea­sure blood oxy­gen lev­els – from com­mer­cial ven­dors. “This was be­fore sci­en­tific pa­pers clearly doc­u­mented how the oxy­gena­tion of Covid-19 pa­tients could de­sat­u­rate quickly and (they could) end up in the ICU if de­tected late. This is one im­por­tant rea­son why, de­spite the large num­bers of mi­grant work­ers af­fected, rel­a­tively few ended up in the ICU,” he said.</p>
    <p>The De­fence Sci­ence and Tech­nol­ogy Agency also pro­vided sys­tems to co­or­di­nate some of these ef­forts and built mo­bile swab sta­tions, self-check tem­per­a­ture kiosks and an­a­lyt­ics soft­ware for bet­ter con­tact trac­ing, among other con­tri­bu­tions, said Dr Ng.</p>
    <p>In April, it was re­ported that 100 sol­diers from the Sin­ga­pore Armed</p>
    <p>Forces Med­i­cal Corps were de­ployed at the Sin­ga­pore Expo com­mu­nity care fa­cil­ity to look af­ter about 1,800 Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Dr Ng pre­sented a record 95 awards for seven schol­ar­ships, in­clud­ing the SAF Schol­ar­ship, SAF En­gi­neer­ing and Medicine schol­ar­ships, and De­fence Sci­ence and Tech­nol­ogy Agency Schol­ar­ship.</p>
    <p>He said he pro­vided the snip­pets of the SAF’s and the wider de­fence com­mu­nity’s con­tri­bu­tions not to praise them, but to show the schol­ar­ship re­cip­i­ents what kind of or­gan­i­sa­tions they will join.</p>
    <p>“It was not as if our staff had been trained for these tasks... we sys­tem­at­i­cally sur­veyed the ter­rain, sized up the chal­lenge and key de­liv­er­ables,” he said, adding that the SAF did all this while con­tin­u­ing crit­i­cal op­er­a­tions for na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that “some high-pro­file schol­ars con­sis­tently go on to lead min­istries and statu­tory boards or en­ter pol­i­tics”, he added that the skill sets and val­ues that Min­def and SAF per­son­nel have are trans­fer­able even af­ter they leave for other vo­ca­tions and ca­reer paths.</p>
    <p>“These qual­i­ties of our of­fi­cers and per­son­nel – to be able to an­a­lyse com­plex, even chaotic sit­u­a­tions, to for­mu­late plans that can be ex­e­cuted amid the dis­or­der, to be able to mar­shal the ap­pro­pri­ate re­sources and man­power to deal with wicked prob­lems – will always be highly val­ued, not only in the mil­i­tary and de­fence are­nas, but also in busi­ness, gov­ern­ment, in­deed in all spheres of so­ci­ety.”</p>
