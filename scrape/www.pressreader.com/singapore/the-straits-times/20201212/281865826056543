    <p>BRUSSELS • Euro­pean Union lead­ers meet­ing i n Brussels have re­solved a stand-off with two east­ern mem­ber states that had threat­ened to de­lay a his­toric €1.8 tril­lion (S$2.92 tril­lion) bud­get and stim­u­lus pack­age just as the lat­est wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion rav­ages the con­ti­nent’s economies.</p>
    <p>A deal was agreed on Thurs­day with Hun­gary and Poland, which had protested a mech­a­nism ty­ing fund­ing to up­hold­ing demo­cratic norms.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man-bro­kered com­pro­mise of­fers re­as­sur­ances over how the new con­di­tions will be ap­plied, but the rule-oflaw pro­vi­sion re­mains in place. The dis­pute was the cul­mi­na­tion of years of clashes be­tween Brussels and the two coun­tries over ev­ery­thing from po­lit­i­cal med­dling in the j udi­ciary to LGBTQ (les­bian, gay, bi­sex­ual, trans­gen­der and queer) rights.</p>
    <p>Un­der the com­pro­mise, the con­di­tion­al­ity will kick in only from Jan 1 next year and re­late to com­mit­ments un­der the new bud­get. Penal­ties, mean­while, will be en­acted only af­ter the Euro­pean Court of Jus­tice has had its say, which could take months.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Com­mis­sion es­ti­mated that the plan could add around 2 per cent to the bloc’s eco­nomic out­put by 2024 and cre­ate two mil­lion ad­di­tional jobs by 2022.</p>
    <p>“Now we can start with the im­ple­men­ta­tion and build back our economies. Our land­mark re­cov­ery pack­age will drive for­ward our green and dig­i­tal tran­si­tions,” Euro­pean Coun­cil pres­i­dent Charles Michel said on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>There was a lot at stake for Hun­gary and Poland. The pair are the big­gest net ben­e­fi­cia­ries of EU cash, help­ing their economies close the gap on their richer neigh­bours to the west, and are in line for at least €180 bil­lion from this spend­ing pack­age.</p>
    <p>Had they gone ahead with their ve­toes, the EU would have switched to an emer­gency bud­get from next year.</p>
    <p>That would have seen fund­ing plunge in al­most all ar­eas and po­ten­tially put Poland and Hun­gary at the back of the line for even the lim­ited devel­op­ment aid that would be avail­able.</p>
    <p>To un­der­line some con­tin­ued near-term lever­age over the EU, Hun­gar­ian Prime Min­is­ter Vik­tor Or­ban noted that the EU bud­get and re­cov­ery fund would still need rat­i­fi­ca­tion in na­tional par­lia­ments, in­clud­ing the Hun­gar­ian and Pol­ish ones, be­fore com­ing into force.</p>
    <p>Some le­gal ex­perts have crit­i­cised the agree­ment, rais­ing con­cerns that it lets Mr Or­ban in par­tic­u­lar off the hook.</p>
    <p>EU l ead­ers also dis­cussed Covid-19 vac­cines, re­la­tions with Wash­ing­ton, sanc­tions on Turkey for drilling in con­tested wa­ters in the east Mediter­ranean Sea and ex­tend­ing sanc­tions on Rus­sia.</p>
