    <p>Loan mora­to­ri­ums, Covid-19 aid and demo­cratic re­forms – th­ese are some of the key de­mands of Malaysia’s op­po­si­tion lead­ers in re­turn for sup­port­ing the gov­ern­ment’s up­com­ing bud­get.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim, who tried to take over Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s post af­ter claim­ing in Septem­ber to com­mand ma­jor­ity sup­port, has pro­posed a “bi­par­ti­san” ap­proach in for­mu­lat­ing the bud­get.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri An­war, along with his Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) ally Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party, had con­sis­tently called for an ex­ten­sion of the blan­ket loan mora­to­rium that was given to over eight mil­lion Malaysian bor­row­ers be­tween April and Septem­ber, amid the eco­nomic fall­out from the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has so far re­sisted the calls for a blan­ket ex­ten­sion, in­stead al­low­ing banks to of­fer tar­geted debt re­pay­ment re­lief to those who lost their jobs dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, PH sub­mit­ted its list of rec­om­men­da­tions on the bud­get to Fi­nance Min­is­ter Tengku Zafrul Tengku Ab­dul Aziz, which in­cluded a re­quest for the loan mora­to­rium and for wage sub­si­dies to be ex­tended un­til the end of next March, re­ported The Star.</p>
    <p>PH sec­re­tary-gen­eral Sai­fud­din Na­su­tion Is­mail said it also pro­posed in­creased devel­op­ment ex­pen­di­ture on In­ter­net con­nec­tiv­ity and wa­ter in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>“We hope our rec­om­men­da­tions will be in­cor­po­rated into the bud­get,” he said.</p>
    <p>Strictly speak­ing, Tan Sri Muhyid­din may not need votes from his po­lit­i­cal ri­vals to push the bud­get through Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>His Perikatan Na­sional pact still</p>
    <p>com­mands a slim ma­jor­ity, with 113 of the 222 seats in the Lower House, af­ter its big­gest party – Umno – twice reaf­firmed its back­ing last week.</p>
    <p>But strik­ing so-called con­fi­dence and sup­ply agree­ments with op­po­si­tion par­ties could help bol­ster his</p>
    <p>po­si­tion and en­sure the bud­get passes with­out a hitch.</p>
    <p>The King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ahmad Shah, last week re­fused to grant Mr Muhyid­din emer­gency pow­ers that would have sus­pended Par­lia­ment and al­lowed the gov­ern­ment’s ex­pen­di­ture for</p>
    <p>next year to be ap­proved with­out be­ing scru­ti­nised by law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>But he has also ad­vised all law­mak­ers to back Mr Muhyid­din’s bud­get, say­ing they should fo­cus on the well-be­ing of the peo­ple and the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din has in­di­cated that his gov­ern­ment will lis­ten to the op­po­si­tion in or­der to gain bi­par­ti­san sup­port for the bud­get.</p>
    <p>“I hope all par­lia­men­tar­i­ans can put aside their po­lit­i­cal dif­fer­ences and pass the bud­get,” he said dur­ing a tele­vised ad­dress last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>“Let’s put peo­ple be­fore all else. “If we do so, we can come to an un­der­stand­ing with any op­po­si­tion.”</p>
    <p>But Subang MP Wong Chen, from Mr An­war’s Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat, has said the party’s sup­port for Mr Muhyid­din’s bud­get should be used as a bar­gain­ing chip in ex­change for demo­cratic re­forms.</p>
    <p>Chief among th­ese re­forms is for Par­lia­ment to al­low con­fi­dence mo­tions against Mr Muhyid­din to be tabled and de­bated.</p>
    <p>There are at least 25 no-con­fi­dence mo­tions that have been filed for the up­com­ing ses­sion, but they are un­likely to be de­bated as the Lower House pri­ori­tises gov­ern­ment busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Other re­form de­mands in­clude equal al­lo­ca­tions for all MPs re­gard­less of po­lit­i­cal af­fil­i­a­tion and a law to en­sure Par­lia­ment’s in­de­pen­dence from the ex­ec­u­tive.</p>
    <p>Parti Warisan Sabah, which is aligned to Mr An­war’s PH bloc, has re­quested greater as­sis­tance for Sabah, Malaysia’s worst-hit state in the cur­rent third wave of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Warisan pres­i­dent Shafie Ap­dal said last Tues­day that the party would sup­port a bud­get that im­proves the state’s health fa­cil­i­ties and quar­an­tine cen­tres, as well as ex­tends fi­nan­cial aid to the needy.</p>
