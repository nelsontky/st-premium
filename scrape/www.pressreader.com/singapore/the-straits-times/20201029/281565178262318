    <p>1 Ty­phoon hits Viet­nam</p>
    <p>At least two peo­ple were killed and 26 oth­ers miss­ing as Ty­phoon Molave slammed into cen­tral Viet­nam yes­ter­day, knock­ing down trees and tear­ing roofs off homes in some of the worst destruc­tion seen in years. The au­thor­i­ties can­celled hun­dreds of flights, closed schools and evac­u­ated around 375,000 peo­ple to safety.</p>
    <p>QUANG NGAI, VIET­NAM • Two peo­ple were re­ported killed and 26 oth­ers miss­ing as Ty­phoon Molave hit cen­tral Viet­nam yes­ter­day, knock­ing down trees and tear­ing roofs off homes in some of the worst destruc­tion seen in years.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties re­lo­cated around 375,000 peo­ple to safety, can­celled hun­dreds of flights and closed schools and beaches ahead of the ty­phoon, which made land­fall south of Danang pack­ing winds of up to 145kmh.</p>
    <p>State me­dia said at least two peo­ple were killed in Quang Ngai prov­ince while try­ing to pro­tect their homes from the storm.</p>
    <p>“The peo­ple of Viet­nam are tough, yet this is among the worst destruc­tions ever seen in many ar­eas,” said Viet­nam Red Cross So­ci­ety pres­i­dent Nguyen Thi Xuan Thu. “The re­lent­less storms and flood­ing are tak­ing a dev­as­tat­ing hu­man toll, fur­ther de­stroy­ing liveli­hoods and iso­lat­ing mil­lions of peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials were also search­ing for 26 miss­ing fish­er­men, with the storm – Viet­nam’s fourth this month – bring­ing waves up to 6m high as power was cut off across the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Navy and sur­veil­lance ves­sels were de­ployed to look for the crew mem­bers af­ter their two boats dis­ap­peared af­ter they at­tempted to dock, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Trinh Dinh Dung said.</p>
    <p>A fish­ing ban has been in place since Tues­day, while all air­ports in the area were closed un­til fur­ther no­tice.</p>
    <p>The ty­phoon comes on the back of weeks of se­vere flood­ing and land­slides that have claimed 130 lives and dam­aged or de­stroyed over 310,000 homes, said the In­ter­na­tional Fed­er­a­tion of Red Cross and Red Cres­cent So­ci­eties. Close to 1.2 mil­lion peo­ple were in “se­vere dan­ger” and in need of re­lief, it warned.</p>
    <p>Red Cross spokesman Christo­pher Rassi said: “These re­lent­less storms are yet another ex­am­ple of the dev­as­tat­ing im­pact of cli­mate change.”</p>
    <p>Viet­nam is prone to nat­u­ral dis­as­ters in the rainy sea­son be­tween June and Novem­ber.</p>
