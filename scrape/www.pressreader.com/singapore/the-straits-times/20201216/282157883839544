    <p>The de­fence min­is­ters of Sin­ga­pore and Aus­tralia yes­ter­day wel­comed steady progress made in the de­vel­op­ment of train­ing ar­eas in the Aus­tralian state of Queens­land on the oc­ca­sion of the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces’ (SAF) 30th an­niver­sary of train­ing there.</p>
    <p>De­fence Min­is­ter Ng Eng Hen and his Aus­tralian coun­ter­part Linda Reynolds met vir­tu­ally to com­mem­o­rate the oc­ca­sion, said a Min­istry of De­fence (Min­def) state­ment.</p>
    <p>In a joint state­ment, the min­is­ters reaf­firmed the grow­ing bi­lat­eral de­fence re­la­tion­ship and their shared com­mit­ment to a peace­ful, in­clu­sive and re­silient re­gion with Asean at its core.</p>
    <p>The joint de­vel­op­ment of train­ing ar­eas was for­malised un­der the Sin­ga­pore-Aus­tralia Treaty on Mil­i­tary Train­ing and Train­ing Area De­vel­op­ment in Aus­tralia, which both min­is­ters signed in March.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian Par­lia­ment rat­i­fied the treaty on Dec 10, said Min­def. The treaty al­lows the SAF to have ac­cess to a larger train­ing area in cen­tral and north­ern Queens­land, and fa­cil­i­tates the de­vel­op­ment of mil­i­tary train­ing ar­eas and fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the meet­ing yes­ter­day, the min­is­ters launched a com­mem­o­ra­tive video high­light­ing key mile­stones of the SAF’s train­ing in the Shoal­wa­ter Bay Train­ing Area (SWBTA) since 1990.</p>
    <p>They said the com­mence­ment that year was a “sem­i­nal event” in the de­fence re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>“Con­tin­ued train­ing over the years is a vis­i­ble man­i­fes­ta­tion of our deep and abid­ing re­la­tion­ship, which has ex­panded in scale and reach,” they said.</p>
    <p>“As a re­sult, thou­sands of Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces sol­diers and na­tional ser­vice per­son­nel among them train an­nu­ally in the Shoal­wa­ter Bay Train­ing Area.”</p>
    <p>Dr Ng thanked the govern­ment and peo­ple of Aus­tralia for their strong sup­port of the SAF train­ing in Aus­tralia, while Ms Reynolds ex­pressed ap­pre­ci­a­tion to the Govern­ment and peo­ple of Sin­ga­pore for their long­stand­ing friend­ship and part­ner­ship.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Chief of De­fence Force, Lieu­tenant-Gen­eral Melvyn Ong, and the Chief of the Aus­tralian De­fence Force, Gen­eral An­gus Camp­bell, vir­tu­ally un­veiled a com­mem­o­ra­tive plaque at Camp Growl, which has housed most of the SAF troops who train in SWBTA.</p>
    <p>Ex­er­cise Wal­laby, the SAF’s big­gest over­seas drill that had been held ev­ery year since 1990 at the train­ing area, was sus­pended this year due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In 2013, Ex­er­cise Tri­dent – the sig­na­ture bi­lat­eral ex­er­cise be­tween the SAF and the Aus­tralian De­fence Force in­volv­ing the three ser­vices of both mil­i­taries – was in­cor­po­rated.</p>
    <p>The SWBTA, about four times the size of Sin­ga­pore, al­lows train­ing at a scale and com­plex­ity which can­not be done in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Its ex­pan­sion – which is fa­cil­i­tated un­der the treaty – is sched­uled to be com­pleted by 2024, with ma­jor con­struc­tion works hav­ing started. A new Green­vale Train­ing Area is ex­pected to be com­pleted by 2028.</p>
    <p>The mil­i­taries of Sin­ga­pore and Aus­tralia have a long his­tory of co­op­er­a­tion, with ex­ten­sive in­ter­ac­tions in­clud­ing mul­ti­lat­eral ex­er­cises and pro­fes­sional ex­changes, said Min­def.</p>
    <p>Both de­fence es­tab­lish­ments also co­op­er­ate closely at the Asean De­fence Min­is­ters’ Meet­ing-Plus and the Five Power De­fence Ar­range­ments, it added.</p>
