    <p>Out of 80 staff af­fected by the ter­mi­na­tion of the Kuala Lumpur-Sin­ga­pore High Speed Rail (HSR) project, the ma­jor­ity will re­main in roles at the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA), where they were de­ployed when the project was sus­pended in 2018.</p>
    <p>The 80 em­ploy­ees worked for SG HSR, an in­fra­struc­ture com­pany un­der LTA which will as­sist the rest of the of­fi­cers in tran­si­tion­ing to other suit­able roles within ei­ther the au­thor­ity or the wider public ser­vice, said LTA yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It also confirmed that no new ten­ders have been called since the sus­pen­sion of the project in Septem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>In July 2018, then Trans­port Min­is­ter Khaw Boon Wan told Par­lia­ment that SG HSR had formed a team of more than 100 spe­cial­ists to build, own, fund and main­tain the HSR civil in­fra­struc­ture in Sin­ga­pore. SG HSR had called five ten­ders to con­struct civil in­fra­struc­ture within Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>A few months later in Septem­ber, a two-year de­lay was agreed on. SG HSR then said that its staff of more than 100 would be of­fered al­ter­na­tive jobs in LTA, with the com­pany’s work to be scaled down un­til the project re­sumed.</p>
    <p>Un­der the terms of the de­fer­ment in 2018, both sides called off the on­go­ing in­ter­na­tional joint ten­der for a com­pany to over­see rolling stock and rail as­sets for the HSR.</p>
    <p>In agree­ing to the sus­pen­sion, Sin­ga­pore also in­curred more costs in com­pen­sa­tion to con­trac­tors for break­ing con­tracts, Mr Khaw told Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Malaysia had agreed to re­im­burse Sin­ga­pore $15 mil­lion for these abortive costs.</p>
    <p>In May 2018, Mr Khaw noted that Sin­ga­pore had al­ready racked up an estimated bill of more than $250 mil­lion for work on the project, and would con­tinue to in­cur costs of more than $6 mil­lion in June, more than $6 mil­lion in July, and at least $40 mil­lion from August to the end of 2018.</p>
