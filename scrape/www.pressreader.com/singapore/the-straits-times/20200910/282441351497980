    <p>•</p>
    <p>Cris­tiano Ron­aldo has set his sights on Ali Daei’s record of 109 in­ter­na­tional goals fol­low­ing a dou­ble in Por­tu­gal’s 2-0 Na­tions League win away to Swe­den that saw him reach 101 goals for his coun­try since his de­but in 2004.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing missed Por­tu­gal’s Na­tions League opener against Croa­tia on Satur­day with a toe in­jury, Ron­aldo wasted no time on his re­turn.</p>
    <p>He curled in a first-half ef­fort from 23m over the wall and into the top left cor­ner be­yond the reach of goal­keeper Robin Olsen, his 10th goal for his coun­try from a di­rect free kick. His 80th from open play came in the 72nd minute, cut­ting back in­side the Swedish de­fence and pro­duc­ing a deft fin­ish into the far cor­ner from 18m.</p>
    <p>“I man­aged to beat this mile­stone of 100 goals and now (I’ll go) for the record. It’s step by step. I am not ob­sessed be­cause I be­lieve the records come in a nat­u­ral way,” the 35-year-old Ju­ven­tus star said.</p>
    <p>“When I had this prob­lem in my toe I al­ways knew that I could re­cover for this sec­ond game. I like to be here, with this group of play­ers, coach, staff and knew that they would play well in the first game as our squad is too good and no one is ir­re­place­able.”</p>
    <p>Go­ing into Tues­day’s clash, Swe­den were among 41 coun­tries Ron­aldo had scored against.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing net­ted five times in his pre­vi­ous en­coun­ters against the Nordic side, few would have bet against him writ­ing more his­tory in the Swedish cap­i­tal, es­pe­cially af­ter Gus­tav Svens­son was sent off in the 44th minute.</p>
    <p>Pele, who scored 77 goals for Brazil and is re­garded as one of the great­est to play the game, saw the mile­stone com­ing.</p>
    <p>“I thought we were go­ing to cel­e­brate 100 goals to­day. But it was ac­tu­ally 101! Con­grat­u­la­tions @Cris­tiano, as you reach new heights in your jour­ney,” the three-time World Cup win­ner tweeted.</p>
    <p>Ron­aldo, capped 165 times by Por­tu­gal, forced an­other fine save from Olsen be­fore be­ing re­placed by Diogo Jota in the 81st minute.</p>
    <p>Canada cap­tain Christine Sin­clair holds the all-time in­ter­na­tional record with 186 goals.</p>
    <p>Ron­aldo can close in on the men’s mark when the hold­ers Por­tu­gal meet world cham­pi­ons France in Paris on Oct 11.</p>
    <p>At the Stade de France, Ed­uardo Ca­mavinga made his­tory of his own, be­com­ing France’s youngest in­ter­na­tional in 96 years as Les Bleus won a re­peat of the 2018 World Cup fi­nal over Croa­tia 4-2.</p>
    <p>Rennes mid­fielder Ca­mavinga, aged 17 years and nine months, re­placed N’Golo Kante in the sec­ond half and is only sur­passed by Julien Ver­brug­ghe, aged 16 years and 10 months in 1906, and Mau­rice Gastiger, at 17 years and four months in 1914.</p>
    <p>An­toine Griez­mann, Dayot Upame­cano, Olivier Giroud as well as an own goal from goal­keeper Do­minik Li­vakovic se­cured a re­peat re­sult from Rus­sia two years ago. De­jan Lovren and Josip Brekalo were Croa­tia’s scor­ers.</p>
    <p>France coach Di­dier Deschamps told France’s TF1 broad­cast­ers he would stick with an un­fa­mil­iar 3-4-1-2 for­ma­tion although he con­ceded that it would take time for his team to get used to.</p>
    <p>The re­sult leaves them sec­ond on goal dif­fer­ence in Group A3.</p>
