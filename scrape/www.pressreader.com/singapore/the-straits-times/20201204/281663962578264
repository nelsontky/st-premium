    <p>Mr Eric Liu started his ca­reer as a pro­duc­tion tech­ni­cian, but soon found his work too rou­tine and be­gan think­ing about up­grad­ing his skills.</p>
    <p>He de­cided to en­rol in a part-time diploma pro­gramme in elec­tronic en­gi­neer­ing at Ngee Ann Polytech­nic, and later a part-time de­gree pro­gramme at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr Liu, who is in his late 30s, grad­u­ated from NUS last year with high­est hon­ours and a de­gree in elec­tronic en­gi­neer­ing.</p>
    <p>He was cited by Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong in his speech yes­ter­day. De­scrib­ing Mr Liu as an in­spi­ra­tion to all Sin­ga­pore­ans, Mr Wong said: “With his new skills, he con­tin­ued to progress in his ca­reer, and he started a new job last week as a dig­i­tal hard­ware en­gi­neer in ST En­gi­neer­ing,”</p>
    <p>Grad­u­ates from in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing (IHLs) will have to em­brace work­place learn­ing, the min­is­ter said. In­di­vid­u­als can at­tend train­ing by their com­pa­nies or pro­grammes of­fered by third par­ties and IHLs, lead­ing to qual­i­fi­ca­tions such as a spe­cial­ist diploma.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said the IHLs must sup­port in­di­vid­u­als’ pur­suit of ac­tive learn­ing through­out their ca­reers, and also build re­la­tion­ships with their grad­u­ates.</p>
    <p>“It is not just about get­ting them to donate as alumni, but it is about sup­port­ing your stu­dents af­ter they en­ter the work­force – con­tin­u­ously en­gag­ing your alumni to up­date them­selves on lat­est trends in in­dus­try, to help them grow their pro­fes­sional net­works, and en­cour­ag­ing them to proac­tively up­skill and reskill.”</p>
    <p>He noted that the uni­ver­si­ties have been fo­cus­ing on build­ing up their con­tin­u­ing ed­u­ca­tion and train­ing (CET) de­part­ments and of­fer­ing more mod­ules. “This is truly a growth area be­cause we have to build this up.”</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has found that no coun­try has a good model for adult ed­u­ca­tion and train­ing in place to­day, and Sin­ga­pore will have to come up with a model of its own, Mr Wong added.</p>
    <p>This will be a whole-of-gov­ern­ment ef­fort. For one thing, the coun­try will be in­vest­ing more in Skill­sFu­ture and life­long learn­ing.</p>
    <p>“But we will have to think through how the funds are al­lo­cated, on the sup­ply and de­mand sides, and how we shape in­di­vid­ual and firm-level in­cen­tives to achieve the best out­comes,” he said.</p>
    <p>“In many ways, we are al­ready at the fore­front of pol­icy think­ing in this area, and we will have to con­tinue to in­no­vate and ex­per­i­ment with new pro­grammes and ideas.”</p>
