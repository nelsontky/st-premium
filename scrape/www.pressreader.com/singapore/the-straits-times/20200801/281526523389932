    <p>Like many so­ci­eties, Sin­ga­pore has seen its peo­ple step­ping up to help the needy dur­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis, vol­un­teer­ing, do­nat­ing and rais­ing funds for vul­ner­a­ble groups such as mi­grant work­ers, lower-in­come fam­i­lies and peo­ple who have lost their jobs.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses, too, give back to the com­mu­nity through do­na­tions of cash, masks, sani­tis­ers, food and other es­sen­tial items.</p>
    <p>These be­hav­iours com­ple­ment the Gov­ern­ment’s ef­forts to reach out to needy in­di­vid­u­als and fam­i­lies. This is crit­i­cal, given the ur­gent needs and scale and speed of the eco­nomic, so­cial and psy­cho­log­i­cal im­pact from Covid-19 chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Equally im­por­tant, the vol­un­tary acts of giv­ing re­flect and re­in­force the pos­i­tive at­ti­tudes and ex­pe­ri­ences of the peo­ple and the com­mu­nity amid the global pan­demic. This pos­i­tiv­ity oc­curs for both the giver and the re­cip­i­ent, and it has mul­ti­plier ef­fects.</p>
    <p>Pos­i­tiv­ity also con­trib­utes to Sin­ga­pore’s psy­cho­log­i­cal de­fence in the fight against the coro­n­avirus by help­ing to build the psy­cho­log­i­cal cap­i­tal that peo­ple need, to adapt and deal with the mul­ti­ple chal­lenges – self-ef­fi­cacy, op­ti­mism, hope, re­silience.</p>
    <p>Even though Sin­ga­pore has lifted the cir­cuit breaker and we are grad­u­ally re­open­ing the econ­omy, many in­di­vid­u­als and fam­i­lies hit se­verely by the Covid-19 cri­sis will con­tinue to ex­pe­ri­ence hard­ship or dis­tress. More­over, when new waves of in­fec­tion hit, re­stric­tive curbs may kick in again, re­sult­ing in new or ex­ac­er­bated needs.</p>
    <p>Pos­i­tive at­ti­tudes and ex­pe­ri­ences help peo­ple deal with adap­ta­tion chal­lenges as­so­ci­ated with strict con­tain­ment mea­sures and post-pan­demic re­al­i­ties. They also help with learn­ing and adapt­abil­ity when peo­ple have to leave their com­fort zone to pick up new skills by at­tend­ing train­ing or take up a trainee­ship op­por­tu­nity as a tran­sit to a per­ma­nent job.</p>
    <p>To in­crease our psy­cho­log­i­cal pre­pared­ness and adapt­abil­ity, we need to un­der­stand the sci­ence of pos­i­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>POS­I­TIVE PSY­CHOL­OGY OF GIV­ING</p>
    <p>An as­pect of pos­i­tiv­ity that is im­por­tant for tack­ling Covid-19 chal­lenges is sub­jec­tive well-be­ing, which is about sat­is­fac­tion and hap­pi­ness. Such sub­jec­tive well-be­ing is im­por­tant in help­ing in­di­vid­u­als cope bet­ter.</p>
    <p>Let’s drill into the com­po­nents of sub­jec­tive well-be­ing. Sat­is­fac­tion is the ex­tent to which we eval­u­ate that our needs, wants and pref­er­ences are met. It is the cog­ni­tive com­po­nent of sub­jec­tive well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>Hap­pi­ness is the ex­tent of pos­i­tive emo­tions we are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing, such as a per­sonal sense of mean­ing or feel­ings of joy. It is the emo­tional com­po­nent.</p>
    <p>To­gether, sat­is­fac­tion and hap­pi­ness help us un­der­stand how peo­ple eval­u­ate and ex­pe­ri­ence their lives.</p>
    <p>Giv­ing cre­ates pos­i­tive well-be­ing be­cause re­cip­i­ents’ needs are sat­is­fied, and givers ex­pe­ri­ence pos­i­tive emo­tions when they see their deeds ben­e­fit those who need help. The pos­i­tive at­ti­tudes and ex­pe­ri­ences are mu­tu­ally re­in­forc­ing be­tween the givers and the re­cip­i­ents of help.</p>
    <p>Re­search has shown that giv­ing time, money and other as­sis­tance not only ben­e­fits the re­cip­i­ent but also leads to pos­i­tive out­comes for the giver. When peo­ple give, they de­rive a sense of per­sonal mean­ing from help­ing oth­ers. They also bet­ter ap­pre­ci­ate their own cir­cum­stances as they learn of the sit­u­a­tions fac­ing the less for­tu­nate.</p>
    <p>The in­ter­ac­tion be­tween the givers and the re­cip­i­ents also pro­duces pos­i­tive so­cial re­la­tion­ships and builds so­cial cap­i­tal that will ben­e­fit the com­mu­nity in many ways.</p>
    <p>In the chal­leng­ing times of the pro­tracted Covid-19 cri­sis, it is even more im­por­tant to foster such pos­i­tiv­ity. One way to do this is to in­volve peo­ple in giv­ing, such as do­na­tion, vol­un­teerism, and other com­mu­nity work.</p>
    <p>MEAN­ING AND GROWTH NEEDS</p>
    <p>An­other type of pos­i­tiv­ity re­volves around mean­ing and growth needs. Meet­ing such needs mo­ti­vates pos­i­tive be­hav­iours. They en­able pos­i­tive at­ti­tudes and ex­pe­ri­ences at work.</p>
    <p>Pos­i­tiv­ity at work can be en­cour­aged when we de­velop cer­tain core job char­ac­ter­is­tics that gen­er­ate mean­ing and growth.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, are we cre­at­ing and nur­tur­ing job char­ac­ter­is­tics and work con­di­tions for peo­ple to want to learn new skills and ap­ply them, and also for peo­ple to en­joy what they do at work?</p>
    <p>Stud­ies have shown that job char­ac­ter­is­tics such as skill va­ri­ety, task iden­tity and task sig­nif­i­cance are mo­ti­vat­ing for most em­ploy­ees, and they lead to pos­i­tive at­ti­tudes and be­hav­iours at work.</p>
    <p>Skill va­ri­ety lets us use and prac­tise the dif­fer­ent skills that we have. Task iden­tity means we can iden­tify with what we do as be­ing re­spon­si­ble for the whole or more com­plete out­come of the work. Task sig­nif­i­cance means we can see that what we do con­trib­utes to some­thing wider be­yond our­selves such as the or­gan­i­sa­tion or so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Two ex­tra job char­ac­ter­is­tics or work con­di­tions mat­ter to many peo­ple – hav­ing a rea­son­able level of au­ton­omy or free­dom to de­cide how to ac­com­plish our task and the op­por­tu­nity to re­ceive feedback to know how ef­fec­tive we are at work.</p>
    <p>To­gether, the above five job char­ac­ter­is­tics help make work more mean­ing­ful, make us feel re­spon­si­ble for work out­comes, and help us see the re­sults of our work. These ex­pe­ri­ences lead to pos­i­tive work-re­lated out­comes such as bet­ter job per­for­mance, higher job sat­is­fac­tion, and more or­gan­i­sa­tional cit­i­zen­ship be­hav­iours.</p>
    <p>As we nav­i­gate harsh post-pan­demic re­al­i­ties in­volv­ing dis­rup­tive changes in jobs and work pro­cesses, it is im­por­tant to at­tend to these job char­ac­ter­is­tics to mo­ti­vate pos­i­tive work be­hav­iours and out­comes, and en­sure that the per­sonal sense of hu­man dig­nity is de­vel­oped and not di­min­ished through work.</p>
    <p>POS­I­TIV­ITY CAN COUNTER NEG­A­TIV­ITY</p>
    <p>Re­search has shown that pos­i­tiv­ity can ef­fec­tively counter neg­a­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>But first, neg­a­tive emo­tion by it­self is not the same as neg­a­tiv­ity. When our goals are frus­trated, we ex­pe­ri­ence neg­a­tive emo­tions. Sim­i­larly, we feel neg­a­tive when some­one be­haves in a way that im­pedes or hurts the progress to­wards a col­lec­tive goal that we and many oth­ers are help­ing to achieve.</p>
    <p>An ex­am­ple is when some­one vi­o­lates a Covid-19 safe man­age­ment rule and be­haves in a so­cially ir­re­spon­si­ble way when most of us are ad­her­ing to the mea­sures to con­tain the spread of the coro­n­avirus. But that is not neg­a­tiv­ity – it is sim­ply a neg­a­tive re­ac­tion that we ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Neg­a­tiv­ity, in con­trast, is a mind­set, not just a mo­men­tary emo­tion or re­ac­tion. For ex­am­ple, neg­a­tiv­ity man­i­fests it­self when we form a neg­a­tive opin­ion based on sim­ply know­ing who the per­son is or which group he or she be­longs to, re­gard­less of what the per­son says or does. When we con­sis­tently eval­u­ate oth­ers neg­a­tively be­cause of their par­tic­u­lar group mem­ber­ship or who they are, such as be­ing mem­ber of a po­lit­i­cal party or a na­tion­al­ity group, in­stead of what they said or did, it is a type of neg­a­tive con­fir­ma­tory bias which ac­cu­mu­lates to form neg­a­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Neg­a­tiv­ity is of­ten de­vel­oped, and strength­ened over time, by re­peated un­re­solved neg­a­tive ex­pe­ri­ences and emo­tions. So, don’t just lament or lam­bast neg­a­tiv­ity. Em­pathise with peo­ple’s neg­a­tive ex­pe­ri­ences, and seek to un­der­stand why things have come to this.</p>
    <p>Pos­i­tiv­ity, how­ever, is not the di­rect op­po­site of neg­a­tiv­ity – it is not a pos­i­tive con­fir­ma­tory bias. As I have ex­plained pre­vi­ously, pos­i­tiv­ity in­volves pos­i­tive at­ti­tudes and ex­pe­ri­ences such as self-ef­fi­cacy and sense of mean­ing, and they lead to ac­tual pos­i­tive out­comes like per­for­mance and help­ing be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>Re­search has shown that it is pos­si­ble for us to be­come lower on neg­a­tiv­ity with­out, at the same time, be­com­ing higher on pos­i­tiv­ity. Con­versely, it is pos­si­ble to be low on pos­i­tiv­ity with­out be­ing high on neg­a­tiv­ity. So a re­duc­tion in neg­a­tiv­ity by it­self does not mean that pos­i­tiv­ity is in­creased, and vice versa.</p>
    <p>But re­search has also shown that it is not quite pos­si­ble to be con­sis­tently high in both pos­i­tiv­ity and neg­a­tiv­ity at the same time. The two are coun­ter­act­ing in that hav­ing high in­ten­sity on one – either pos­i­tiv­ity or neg­a­tiv­ity – will make it dif­fi­cult to si­mul­ta­ne­ously have high in­ten­sity on the other. One can be low on both pos­i­tiv­ity and neg­a­tiv­ity, or high on either one but low on the other, but it is dif­fi­cult to be high on both.</p>
    <p>Taken to­gether, the ev­i­dence in­di­cates that pos­i­tiv­ity and neg­a­tiv­ity are not di­rect op­po­site poles of the same thing. They are dif­fer­ent con­structs that are in­versely and mod­er­ately cor­re­lated.</p>
    <p>So, while it may be dif­fi­cult to di­rectly re­duce neg­a­tiv­ity, it is con­struc­tive to fo­cus on in­creas­ing pos­i­tiv­ity. When we suc­cess­fully in­crease pos­i­tiv­ity, we re­duce neg­a­tiv­ity and there­fore the neg­a­tive out­comes as­so­ci­ated with neg­a­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Pos­i­tiv­ity is prob­a­bly the most ef­fec­tive way to counter neg­a­tiv­ity. At the same time, we achieve the many di­rect ben­e­fits of pos­i­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>In man­ag­ing neg­a­tive re­ac­tions dur­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis, it is im­por­tant to un­der­stand the dis­tinc­tion be­tween neg­a­tive emo­tions and neg­a­tiv­ity, and how pos­i­tiv­ity can ef­fec­tively counter neg­a­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Back to the ex­am­ple of pub­lic re­ac­tions to a vi­o­la­tion of safe man­age­ment prac­tices. There have been nu­mer­ous cases of peo­ple ig­nor­ing con­trol mea­sures and be­hav­ing ir­re­spon­si­bly, such as not wear­ing a face mask in pub­lic and fail­ing to main­tain so­cial dis­tanc­ing. Pho­tos of these vi­o­la­tions were cir­cu­lated in so­cial me­dia and also re­ported by main­stream me­dia.</p>
    <p>In all of these cases, re­gard­less of the na­tion­al­ity of the of­fend­ers, Sin­ga­pore­ans ex­pe­ri­enced neg­a­tive emo­tions and re­acted an­grily, and un­der­stand­ably so, be­cause the of­fend­ers were so­cially ir­re­spon­si­ble and frus­trat­ing our col­lec­tive goals to curb the spread of the coro­n­avirus in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in those cases that in­volved of­fend­ers who are for­eign­ers, some Sin­ga­pore­ans gen­er­alised their neg­a­tive com­ments to for­eign­ers in gen­eral liv­ing in Sin­ga­pore or al­leged that for­eign­ers re­ceive pref­er­en­tial favourable treat­ment in the en­force­ment of the Covid-19 safe man­age­ment rules.</p>
    <p>In com­ment­ing on the pub­lic re­ac­tions to these vi­o­la­tions, pol­i­cy­mak­ers and com­mu­nity lead­ers should not con­fuse or un­wit­tingly give the im­pres­sion that they have con­fused an im­por­tant dis­tinc­tion. The le­git­i­mately neg­a­tive emo­tion ex­pe­ri­enced by the gen­eral pub­lic when they re­acted to the so­cially ir­re­spon­si­ble be­hav­iours of the of­fend­ers (re­gard­less of their na­tion­al­ity) is not the same as the neg­a­tiv­ity that some Sin­ga­pore­ans man­i­fest when they ex­trap­o­late neg­a­tive sen­ti­ments to all for­eign­ers in Sin­ga­pore and make un­founded al­le­ga­tions about pref­er­en­tial treat­ment.</p>
    <p>The first is an un­der­stand­able neg­a­tive re­ac­tion to a spe­cific ir­re­spon­si­ble act such as not wear­ing a mask. The sec­ond is a neg­a­tiv­ity mind­set that has been built up to­wards for­eign­ers, which need ad­dress­ing.</p>
    <p>But if we fo­cus ex­clu­sively or dis­pro­por­tion­ately on call­ing out Sin­ga­pore­ans’ neg­a­tive com­ments on for­eign­ers and la­belling the re­ac­tions as xeno­pho­bic, then this dom­i­nant ap­proach to man­ag­ing neg­a­tiv­ity is coun­ter­pro­duc­tive – it will just cre­ate more neg­a­tiv­ity be­cause the pub­lic will rightly or wrongly per­ceive that their con­cerns and le­git­i­mate neg­a­tive re­ac­tions are ig­nored or triv­i­alised.</p>
    <p>So it is im­por­tant to dis­tin­guish be­tween neg­a­tive emo­tions and neg­a­tiv­ity, and be­tween neg­a­tiv­ity and pos­i­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic ex­pres­sions of neg­a­tive emo­tions need not al­ways be a bad thing. They re­flect peo­ple’s con­cerns, as­pi­ra­tions, goals and ex­pe­ri­ences. They high­light the need to clar­ify facts, en­sure im­par­tial­ity, and en­hance fair­ness per­cep­tions. They can and have helped pol­i­cy­mak­ers and lead­ers iden­tify prob­lems, re­visit pri­or­i­ties and for­mu­late so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>But, who­ever we are, we can learn to re­spond ap­pro­pri­ately to avoid un­in­tended con­se­quences that end up fos­ter­ing more neg­a­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, let’s fo­cus more on fos­ter­ing pos­i­tiv­ity in the com­mu­nity to ad­dress neg­a­tiv­ity and tackle Covid-19 adap­ta­tion chal­lenges. Pos­i­tiv­ity is nec­es­sary for us to emerge stronger and bet­ter from the coro­n­avirus cri­sis.</p>
