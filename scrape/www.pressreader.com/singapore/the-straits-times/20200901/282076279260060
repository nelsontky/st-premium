    </section>

    <p>In my maiden speech in Par­lia­ment in 2011, I said that all de­bates in this House will al­ways be guided by one ques­tion: “How can we best en­sure the sur­vival and suc­cess of Sin­ga­pore, and im­prove the lives of Sin­ga­pore­ans?”</p>
    <p>We have over the years ex­am­ined this ques­tion in dif­fer­ent ways.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion has now be­come more critical than ever. We be­gan 2020 full of hope, hav­ing just com­mem­o­rated our Bi­cen­ten­nial last year. None of us could have fore­seen what was to come – the whole of hu­man­ity locked in by a virus; millions of peo­ple in­fected, and lives up­ended; the global econ­omy plunged into the worst re­ces­sion since the Great De­pres­sion; and the ways we earn a liv­ing, go about our lives, and in­ter­act with one an­other turned on their head.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, we mounted a swift and ro­bust re­sponse. To pro­tect lives, we im­posed the cir­cuit breaker. To pro­tect liveli­hoods, we are do­ing all that we can to keep our work­ers in jobs, pre­serve the core ca­pa­bil­i­ties of our busi­nesses and sup­port house­holds dur­ing this dif­fi­cult pe­riod. We com­mit­ted around $100 bil­lion to fight the pan­demic and safe­guard our peo­ple and busi­nesses from the fall­out.</p>
    <p>But as a small and open econ­omy, we can­not defy the full force of this global cri­sis. We have to tackle th­ese chal­lenges amid the un­der­ly­ing shifts that pre­dated Covid-19.</p>
    <p>There is a back­lash against free trade and sharp­en­ing na­tivist in­stincts, be­cause the costs and ben­e­fits of glob­al­i­sa­tion have been un­evenly dis­trib­uted. Tech­nol­ogy and in­no­va­tion are re­shap­ing the na­ture of work, dis­rupt­ing jobs and busi­nesses. Th­ese stresses have in turn caused so­ci­eties to be po­larised... The un­cer­tain­ties cre­ated by Covid-19 have only ac­cel­er­ated th­ese shifts.</p>
    <p>To com­pound mat­ters, gov­ern­ments around the world have fi­nanced mas­sive stim­u­lus pack­ages through bor­row­ing, putting an even greater bur­den on fu­ture gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>It is against this som­bre back­drop that we open our 14th Par­lia­ment. As the Pres­i­dent said in her speech, we are at an in­flec­tion point in our his­tory. Now, more than ever, we must ask: How can we best en­sure the sur­vival and suc­cess of Sin­ga­pore, and im­prove the lives of Sin­ga­pore­ans in th­ese un­prece­dented times?</p>
    <p>We can an­swer this in one line: Adapt to change, but stay true to our val­ues.</p>
    <p>Change will leave us be­hind if we stand still. That we must adapt is a given.</p>
    <p>What will de­fine this term of Govern­ment is how we will adapt, that will build a bet­ter life for our peo­ple. Even as we keep pace with change, we must stay true to the val­ues that have en­abled us to progress all th­ese years.</p>
    <p>By em­brac­ing change with courage and con­fi­dence, we build our ca­pac­ity to adapt. By stay­ing true to our val­ues, we strengthen our sense of com­mon pur­pose. By work­ing in close part­ner­ship, we ad­vance as Sin­ga­pore To­gether.</p>
    <p>I will speak about how we need to adapt as an econ­omy, a so­ci­ety and a peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Adapt­ing as an econ­omy</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic story over the decades has been one of con­stant adap­ta­tion, re­struc­tur­ing and trans­for­ma­tion. Our lat­est re­fresh started in 2016, with In­dus­try Trans­for­ma­tion Maps to spur sec­tor-spe­cific adap­ta­tion through­out our econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The ef­fort has borne fruit. Pro­duc­tiv­ity and wages were go­ing up be­fore Covid-19 struck. In­dus­try play­ers have also found new ways of work­ing to­gether to raise the com­pet­i­tive­ness of their in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>In­deed, bear­ing fruit is not just a metaphor here. I met a fruit seller Jun Sheng, bet­ter known as</p>
    <p>“Ah Boy” at Block 58 Mar­ket­place in Be­dok. In ad­di­tion to op­er­at­ing a phys­i­cal stall, he sells fruits on­line and even takes or­ders via What­sApp. Many hawk­ers and small busi­nesses is­land­wide are also go­ing dig­i­tal. We must do what we can to sup­port our work­ers and busi­ness, big and small, and make such in­no­va­tion per­va­sive.</p>
    <p>While we have made progress in in­dus­try trans­for­ma­tion, we must look ahead and pre­pare our­selves for even faster and more dis­rup­tive change. To emerge stronger as an econ­omy, we must strengthen our ca­pac­ity in four ar­eas.</p>
    <p>First, we must take an even more in­te­grated and co­or­di­nated ap­proach to eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy is very com­plex, with multiple stake­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>In our sys­tem, tri­par­tism – the Govern­ment, busi­nesses and the labour move­ment work­ing to­gether – has been a tremen­dous source of strength.</p>
    <p>Two years back, as chair­man of the Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion, I vis­ited the Nether­lands to learn more about its “triple he­lix” model of in­no­va­tion – where govern­ment, busi­nesses and academia work to­gether to build knowl­edge, test pro­to­types and scale in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>Like some re­search tri­an­gles in the United States, the Dutch have done well. This model is be­ing ex­panded to in­cor­po­rate other di­men­sions such as so­ci­etal re­spon­si­bil­ity and en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>In essence, the econ­omy is very com­plex in how it al­lo­cates re­sources, gen­er­ates in­no­va­tive ideas, and in how re­turns are dis­trib­uted across multiple stake­hold­ers. While there is a com­pet­i­tive el­e­ment in this, there are also ben­e­fits to be gained from work­ing to­gether for shared pros­per­ity.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore can build on our tri­par­tite part­ner­ship to be a test bed that cre­ates deeper link­ages with an ex­panded set of stake­hold­ers – in­clud­ing our ed­u­ca­tion and re­search in­sti­tu­tions, our community groups, and in­ter­ested part­ners from around the world. By do­ing so, we can cre­ate good jobs for our peo­ple and new op­por­tu­ni­ties for en­trepreneur­s.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, we must re­dou­ble our ef­forts to de­velop ev­ery­one to his or her fullest po­ten­tial. In this way, our peo­ple can take on new op­por­tu­ni­ties and flour­ish in their cho­sen pur­suits. We need a holis­tic ap­proach for this that spans the lifetime of in­di­vid­u­als, from birth to pre-school to schools, all the way to life­long learn­ing as part of Skill­sFu­ture. I am glad our work­ers are em­brac­ing up­skilling, with about half a mil­lion tak­ing part in Skill­sFu­ture pro­grammes last year.</p>
    <p>And we have to ex­plore new pos­si­bil­i­ties for de­vel­op­ing our peo­ple fully.</p>
    <p>Third, we must strengthen our pathfind­ing ca­pac­ity to find new bright spots amid eco­nomic dis­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>Seek­ing new paths, new con­nec­tions</p>
    <p>Four months ago, we set up the Emerg­ing Stronger Task­force to iden­tify and seize new op­por­tu­ni­ties in emerg­ing trends. The task force has made good progress and com­mis­sioned seven Al­liances for Action. Th­ese in­dus­try-led coali­tions to pi­lot ideas quickly rep­re­sent a new, action-ori­ented ap­proach to pur­sue spe­cific growth ar­eas.</p>
    <p>The ideas be­ing ex­plored are promis­ing. They range from en­vi­ron­men­tal sus­tain­abil­ity to smart com­merce, sup­ply chain dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and the use of robotics. Th­ese can cre­ate new growth mar­kets for our busi­nesses and good jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>We will invest in in­cu­bat­ing and ac­cel­er­at­ing start-ups, and sup­port­ing es­tab­lished com­pa­nies to ex­pand their R&D to build com­pet­i­tive strengths. Such a vi­brant in­no­va­tion ecosys­tem will build up our path-find­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Fourth, we must find new ways to be a vi­tal node, with rich and deep in­ter­con­nec­tions with the rest of the world.</p>
    <p>As a small city-state, be­ing open is our strength and op­por­tu­nity. Un­like other ma­jor cities, we do not have do­mes­tic hin­ter­lands that buf­fer us against shocks. We can­not take for granted that, in a post-Covid-19 world, we can con­tinue to be the same kind of hub that we used to be.</p>
    <p>We must there­fore forge new forms of con­nec­tions, such as dig­i­tal econ­omy agree­ments, while deep­en­ing our link­ages with re­gional mar­kets to ride on Asia’s po­ten­tial.</p>
    <p>We must also re­main open to in­vest­ment and tal­ent from around the world. In this eco­nomic cli­mate, we un­der­stand that many Sin­ga­pore­ans are anx­ious about their liveli­hoods. Our start­ing point is that our eco­nomic strate­gies must serve the in­ter­ests of Sin­ga­pore­ans. The for­eign in­vest­ments we at­tract must cre­ate mean­ing­ful jobs for our peo­ple and strengthen our cor­po­rate ecosys­tem. Sin­ga­pore­ans must re­ceive fair con­sid­er­a­tion at the work­place.</p>
    <p>We are there­fore adapt­ing our man­power poli­cies, in­clud­ing our Em­ploy­ment Pass and S Pass poli­cies, to the chang­ing cir­cum­stances, to en­sure that Sin­ga­pore­ans’ in­ter­ests are up­held. But to emerge stronger, we must re­sist any temp­ta­tion to turn in­wards. We can­not close our­selves to the world, or make for­eign­ers un­wel­come in our so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>We must al­ways serve the in­ter­est of Sin­ga­pore­ans. The best way is to en­sure that this lit­tle red dot – with no nat­u­ral re­sources of any kind, but with a de­ter­mined, hard­work­ing, for­ward-look­ing peo­ple – is to re­main use­ful and rel­e­vant to the world.</p>
    <p>We do this by keep­ing our econ­omy vi­brant and com­pet­i­tive, so that Sin­ga­pore­ans and other peo­ple choose to be here, to invest and do busi­ness, thereby cre­at­ing good jobs and op­por­tu­ni­ties for all of us. Mr Patrick Tay (a labour MP who is Na­tional Trades Union Congress as­sis­tant sec­re­tarygen­eral) is right that we should cre­ate even stronger link­ages in the form of skills maps, job re­design, and the re­train­ing and reskilling of our work­ers, to take on new jobs.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, we must also make a de­lib­er­ate ef­fort to de­velop Sin­ga­pore­ans for lead­er­ship roles in com­pa­nies, so that they can take Sin­ga­pore for­ward. Sin­ga­pore, as a re­gional op­er­a­tional head­quar­ters, has what it takes. Sin­ga­pore­ans, in a mul­tira­cial, multi-reli­gious, mul­ti­cul­tural en­vi­ron­ment, can con­nect with peo­ple all around us and build deep link­ages with our friends in the re­gion. This is some­thing that we will pur­sue.</p>
    <p>At the same time, we must not un­der­mine the essence of what has made us suc­cess­ful. Even as we adapt to a chang­ing world, we must stay true to our val­ues – our sense of unity as a peo­ple, our com­po­si­tion as a mul­ti­cul­tural so­ci­ety. We must stay true to our value to the world, as an oa­sis of har­mony in this frac­tious world.</p>
    <p>Adapt­ing as a so­ci­ety</p>
    <p>Even as we evolve our eco­nomic strate­gies, our so­ci­ety too is fac­ing new chal­lenges and needs to con­tinue to adapt, to sus­tain the prom­ise of progress for ev­ery Sin­ga­porean. We must not let change lead to po­lar­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>In the early days of our de­vel­op­ment, our econ­omy was grow­ing strongly. A ris­ing tide lifted all boats, and most Sin­ga­pore­ans saw their lives im­prove by leaps and bounds. We in­vested in our peo­ple so that they could adapt and grow with our econ­omy.</p>
    <p>As our econ­omy ma­tured, we also strength­ened our so­cial safety nets. For ex­am­ple, we im­proved health­care af­ford­abil­ity, through MediShield Life and Chas (Community Health As­sist Scheme), and pro­vided ex­tra sup­port for the Pi­o­neer and Merdeka gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>We up­lifted the wages of our lower-wage work­ers through Work­fare and the Pro­gres­sive Wage Model. Our so­cial spend­ing has tripled over the last 15 years and this is set to rise fur­ther as our pop­u­la­tion ages.</p>
    <p>Look­ing ahead, our econ­omy will change at a much more rapid pace.</p>
    <p>Dis­rup­tion to jobs will be more com­mon with the greater adop­tion of tech­nol­ogy, such as au­to­ma­tion and re­mote work. We must there­fore take an in­te­grated view of our eco­nomic and so­cial poli­cies. As our labour move­ment puts it, a job is the best form of wel­fare for our peo­ple. The Govern­ment will con­tinue to invest in our peo­ple, match them to new op­por­tu­ni­ties and bring out the best in all Sin­ga­pore­ans. This way, we will keep so­cial mo­bil­ity alive.</p>
    <p>At the same time, with ma­jor changes in the econ­omy and labour market, we will need to adapt our so­cial safety nets and keep inequal­ity in check.</p>
    <p>More work­ers will fall on hard times and we need to en­able them to ad­just and bounce back through this cri­sis and be­yond. Some Sin­ga­pore­ans are also tak­ing part in the “gig” econ­omy, tak­ing on a wide range of jobs, ei­ther part-time or full-time. So our sup­port for self-em­ployed per­sons will have to evolve ac­cord­ingly. We must con­tinue to up­lift our lower-wage work­ers and en­able our older work­ers to con­tinue work­ing, if they wish to.</p>
    <p>De­mands on so­cial safety nets</p>
    <p>Var­i­ous ideas have been pro­posed on how we can do this, such as a min­i­mum wage, uni­ver­sal ba­sic in­come and un­em­ploy­ment in­sur­ance. The Govern­ment will keep an open mind to all th­ese ideas. But we must also recog­nise there are no magic bul­lets. Each of th­ese ideas has its mer­its as well as un­in­tended ef­fects. We have to con­sider the trade-offs and be clear about what works for our con­text and our times.</p>
    <p>De­mands on our so­cial safety nets are in­creas­ing, at a time when our rev­enue base is grow­ing more slowly and with sharper com­pe­ti­tion for tax rev­enue across coun­tries. So I must cau­tion against look­ing for what may ap­pear to be “cost­less solutions” – some­how, some­one else will have to pay for th­ese schemes.</p>
    <p>There are trade-offs. If we want higher so­cial spend­ing, taxes will have to go up. Or it will mean spend­ing more at the ex­pense of fu­ture gen­er­a­tions, like what many coun­tries are do­ing by rais­ing debt. We must never for­get that we have pro­vided al­most $100 bil­lion of sup­port for our peo­ple and busi­nesses this year, with­out in­cur­ring a sin­gle cent of debt, be­cause we were able to fund more than half of this us­ing past re­serves.</p>
    <p>At the same time, while we must strengthen our so­cial safety nets, we must do so in a way that re­in­forces, and not un­der­mines, an in­di­vid­ual’s ef­forts. A strong com­pact main­tains a bal­ance be­tween the roles of the in­di­vid­ual, fam­ily, community and the Govern­ment, and helps us bet­ter cope with change to­gether.</p>
    <p>In­deed, a so­cial safety net can­not be­come a set of shack­les. It should not hold down those who started with less. It should not cre­ate de­pen­dency such that peo­ple who get fish for to­day never learn how to fish for food to­mor­row. It should not breed an en­ti­tled class who asks: “What more can you do for me?”</p>
    <p>A well-de­signed so­cial safety net pro­tects the vul­ner­a­ble, in­vests in hu­man and so­ci­etal cap­i­tal, and pro­vides a means for those who fall down to bounce back. It gives hope and builds con­fi­dence. It be­lieves in peo­ple and lifts the hu­man spirit. It sup­ports ev­ery gen­er­a­tion to have as­pi­ra­tions and dreams, and for ev­ery­one to ask: “What more can we do for one an­other?”</p>
    <p>As MPs de­bate how we can strengthen our sup­port for Sin­ga­pore­ans, let’s keep in mind how new en­hance­ments can be funded eq­ui­tably and sus­tain­ably over time, and strengthen our peo­ple’s ca­pac­ity to not only</p>
    <p>Af­firm­ing our val­ues as a peo­ple</p>
    <p>How we can best en­sure the sur­vival and suc­cess of Sin­ga­pore, and im­prove the lives of Sin­ga­pore­ans de­pends on how well we adapt to change. As we adapt, and in some cases make ma­jor ad­just­ments be­cause the cir­cum­stances we face have changed sig­nif­i­cantly, we must stay rooted to our val­ues and iden­tity, and above all, our unity as one peo­ple.</p>
    <p>I have been en­cour­aged to see how Covid-19 has strength­ened our sense of com­mon pur­pose and brought out the best in us. Many have stepped up to sup­port oth­ers. One ex­am­ple is the Masks Sewn With Love project, a community ef­fort that has sewn more than 250,000 masks for vul­ner­a­ble fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>This sense of unity, through both good times and bad, is rooted in the val­ues en­shrined in our Pledge and the dis­tinct Sin­ga­porean iden­tity we have evolved through the years.</p>
    <p>It will take more ef­fort to main­tain this sense of com­mon pur­pose as our so­ci­ety be­comes more di­verse. Our so­ci­ety will face new dif­fer­ences along the lines of iden­tity, so­cio-eco­nomic sta­tus and po­lit­i­cal be­liefs. There will al­ways be dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives on sub­jects like race, lan­guage and re­li­gion, and the rights and obli­ga­tions of cit­i­zen­ship.</p>
    <p>It is es­sen­tial that we rise above our dif­fer­ences and find com­mon ground.</p>
    <p>Oc­ca­sional set­backs need not trip us in our per­se­v­er­ence to con­tinue to make progress. Har­mony in di­ver­sity will al­ways be a work in progress. We may not al­ways agree, but we can­not af­ford to let our dis­agree­ment turn into di­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>Oth­er­wise, change will cause a rup­ture in so­ci­ety, as we have seen else­where. The bet­ter we adapt to change and stay true to our val­ues, the stronger we can emerge from this and fu­ture crises. The stronger we are at home, the more con­fi­dent we can be to stake our place in the world and cre­ate value with oth­ers. This has been our for­mula for sur­vival and suc­cess.</p>
    <p>We are de­ter­mined to up­hold a rules-based global or­der, which has taken us to where we are to­day.</p>
    <p>As a small na­tion that threat­ens no coun­try, we want to be friends with all and to work with all.</p>
    <p>We are both a city-state and a global me­trop­o­lis. Main­tain­ing this “dual iden­tity” will not be easy. But as long as we are clear about our val­ues and what holds us to­gether, it will be a source of strength that opens up new op­por­tu­ni­ties. This is our Sin­ga­pore premium. Let us con­tinue to work with like-minded part­ners to build a bet­ter world, for Sin­ga­pore­ans, for peo­ple around the world and for our fu­ture gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Con­clu­sion</p>
    <p>Since our in­de­pen­dence, we have weath­ered one cri­sis af­ter an­other, from the with­drawal of Bri­tish forces and the en­su­ing mas­sive un­em­ploy­ment, to the 1973 oil cri­sis, Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis, Sars, 2001 IT bub­ble col­lapse and the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>All of us in our 50s and older would have lived through th­ese tur­bu­lent pe­ri­ods. Each time, Sin­ga­pore­ans would have been called upon to show for­ti­tude and re­silience, and work in unity with our fel­low cit­i­zens. And each time, we have risen to the chal­lenge, adapted and emerged stronger.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic could be our most se­vere test so far. To over­come this cri­sis, we will have to once again draw upon and build on this ca­pac­ity to adapt and re­main united and stand true to our val­ues. We can nav­i­gate this pe­riod of great un­cer­tainty and change, but our pol­i­tics must set the right tone for the rest of so­ci­ety</p>
    <p>This House must ful­fil its duty to ar­tic­u­late and de­bate pol­icy op­tions, to build a bet­ter life for our peo­ple and to ad­vance Sin­ga­pore’s place in the world. This is the man­date that has been en­trusted to us by Sin­ga­pore­ans. I trust that all of us, whether in Govern­ment or the Op­po­si­tion, will share this com­mon sense of mis­sion, to serve in the best in­ter­ests of Sin­ga­pore­ans and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>My col­leagues and I in Govern­ment have lis­tened to the voices of our peo­ple. We have heard and share our peo­ples’ anx­i­eties. We ac­knowl­edge the con­cerns and un­hap­pi­ness that some have voiced. As the world and our so­ci­ety changes, there will be a greater di­ver­gence of views. We will con­tinue to un­der­stand your con­cerns and im­prove your lives. We will have to adapt to th­ese changes but stay true to the val­ues. The same val­ues that have en­abled us to stay united and suc­ceed against the odds.</p>
