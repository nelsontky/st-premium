    <p>One of the most fa­mous film­mak­ers on the planet, Werner Her­zog is also one of the most ec­cen­tric, known for a larg­erthan-life per­sona that is as quirky as his movies.</p>
    <p>The lat­ter in­clude the ac­claimed his­tor­i­cal drama Aguirre, The Wrath Of God (1972), about a band of ex­plor­ers’ de­scent into mad­ness; and the Os­car-nom­i­nated En­coun­ters At The End Of The World (2007), a doc­u­men­tary on the phys­i­cal and psy­cho­log­i­cal ex­tremes of liv­ing on Antarc­tica.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man movie-maker’s rep­u­ta­tion as an artist is ex­ceeded only by his pub­lic per­sona, which has led Van­ity Fair mag­a­zine and oth­ers to dub him “the most in­ter­est­ing man in the world” – he once di­rected an ac­tor at gun­point, saved an­other from a car wreck and was shot with an air ri­fle on cam­era.</p>
    <p>His new doc­u­men­tary, now air­ing on Ap­ple TV+, is as es­o­teric as the oth­ers he has made later in his career. Fire­ball: Vis­i­tors From Darker Worlds – which he codi­rects with Clive Op­pen­heimer and nar­rates in his sig­na­ture sonorous bari­tone – looks at how me­te­orites and other deep im­pacts have shaped hu­man cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times by video call from his Los An­ge­les home, the 78-year-old ex­plains why he was drawn to this sub­ject. He also com­ments on why he is of­ten cast as the vil­lain when he makes on-screen cameos, as he did in the Star Wars spin-off show The Man­dalo­rian (2019 to present) and op­po­site Tom Cruise in Jack Reacher (2012).</p>
    <p>Does think­ing about a civil­i­sa­tion-end­ing me­te­orite im­pact keep you up at night?</p>
    <p>I’m not afraid – that’s not in my vo­cab­u­lary. And it’s very un­likely Earth will be hit by a me­te­orite. With our tele­scopes, we will know far in ad­vance about the im­pact of some­thing very large.</p>
    <p>As­teroids move on some­thing like a race­track – one might come close once ev­ery 450 years and we can pre­dict that math­e­mat­i­cally, ob­serve it and de­fend our­selves. So, it’s not such a big thing.</p>
    <p>It’s mostly Hol­ly­wood movies that show you the catas­tro­phe. But we don’t have to panic.</p>
    <p>How im­por­tant to the film was the science of me­te­orites and mak­ing that ac­ces­si­ble?</p>
    <p>It was clear this shouldn’t be di­dac­tic. We are mak­ing a movie that is fas­ci­nated by the people whose cul­tures are formed by it, like is­lan­ders in the Tor­res Strait be­tween New Guinea and Aus­tralia, who be­lieve the souls of the de­parted ride to the nether­world on me­te­ors.</p>
    <p>And we talk to sci­en­tists in Antarc­tica who are so ex­cited to find a big rock there that came from outer space. So we found out about the hu­man con­di­tion – that was more im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>You are one of the most ac­claimed doc­u­men­tary film-mak­ers to­day. Do you think the art form is see­ing a golden age with the ad­vent of stream­ing plat­forms?</p>
    <p>Lots of con­tent has been cre­ated by the stream­ing ser­vices and one of their great ad­van­tages is they can show movies un­in­ter­rupted by com­mer­cials.</p>
    <p>Stream­ing has also given us the pos­si­bil­ity of wide-reach­ing doc­u­men­tary se­ries that are like eight or 10 one-hour films. It’s like hav­ing big epic for­mats pos­si­ble all of a sud­den – and you can watch it on your lap­top or cell­phone from a small vil­lage in Africa.</p>
    <p>Are there sim­i­lar­i­ties be­tween projects you’ve di­rected and those you’ve done act­ing cameos on, like The Man­dalo­rian?</p>
    <p>My films are full of cu­rios­ity and a sense of awe about what we are as hu­man be­ings.</p>
    <p>We can’t line up The Man­dalo­rian with those be­cause I was only an ac­tor there – I didn’t make it.</p>
    <p>But I love any­thing that has to do with cin­ema, so while act­ing is some­thing I have never vol­un­teered for – I was dragged into this – it was a very joyful ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>It was good to work for a few days and the re­sult has ex­cited a lot of au­di­ences. But I’m only good as the bad guy.</p>
    <p>Fire­ball: Vis­i­tors From Darker Worlds is avail­able on Ap­ple TV+.</p>
