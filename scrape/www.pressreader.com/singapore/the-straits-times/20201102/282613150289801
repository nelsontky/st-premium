    <p>The four mem­bers of Tai­wanese boy band F4 sang their iconic song Me­teor Rain for a show on China’s Jiangsu Tele­vi­sion last Fri­day, in a much an­tic­i­pated per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>But many fans were left dis­ap­pointed by the so-called re­union.</p>
    <p>Jiangsu Tele­vi­sion an­nounced last week that the quar­tet – com­pris­ing Jerry Yan, 43; Vic Chou, 39; Ken Chu, 41; and Van Ness Wu, 42 – would re­unite on its show, 1001 Night Fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>The news ex­cited many of the group’s fans, as it has been nearly eight years since F4 last per­formed to­gether at Jiangsu Tele­vi­sion’s Spring Fes­ti­val Gala in Jan­uary 2013.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, the four singers duly ap­peared dur­ing the show, per­form­ing Me­teor Rain and an­other song, First Time.</p>
    <p>How­ever, fans no­ticed some­thing amiss when they kept a dis­tance from one an­other and had zero in­ter­ac­tions through­out the seg­ment.</p>
    <p>It was re­vealed later that three of the singers – Yan, Chou and Chu – were pro­jected on stage through vir­tual tech­nol­ogy af­ter fans posted on Weibo pho­tos show­ing only Wu on stage.</p>
    <p>Many fans said they felt cheated by the so-called re­union on stage.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, Chu con­firmed that he was not in China. He wrote on Weibo: “Watch­ing my own im­age on Fri­day and re­turn­ing to school on Satur­day. The im­age was il­lu­sory and only knowl­edge is the hard truth.”</p>
    <p>The other F4 mem­bers did not com­ment.</p>
    <p>The back­lash from the fans was so great that Jiangsu Tele­vi­sion had to come out to ac­knowl­edge the “il­lu­sion”.</p>
    <p>The sta­tion said that the F4 mem­bers were in­ter­ested in gath­er­ing to­gether for the re­union, but could not travel to China due to the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Wu was able to ap­pear on the show as he is in China to take part in the fi­nale of Chi­nese re­al­ity show, Street Dance Of China: Sea­son 3.</p>
    <p>In­ci­den­tally, this year marks the 20th an­niver­sary of F4’s for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The band shot to star­dom overnight af­ter act­ing in the pop­u­lar 2001 idol drama, Me­teor Gar­den, an adap­ta­tion of the Ja­panese girls’ comic Boys Over Flow­ers.</p>
    <p>The show led to a se­quel in 2002 and also sub­se­quent tele­vi­sion adap­ta­tions in Ja­pan and South Korea and a re­make in China.</p>
    <p>The show’s theme song, Me­teor Rain, also be­came fa­mous and led to F4-ma­nia in Asia. The four have gone their sep­a­rate ways since 2009.</p>
    <p>There have been ru­mours of dis­cord be­tween band mem­bers, although Chu said on a Chi­nese va­ri­ety show last year that they are like col­leagues, with lit­tle in­ter­ac­tion out­side work.</p>

        <p data-role="text">The pur&#xAD;ported F4 re&#xAD;union on China&#x2019;s Jiangsu Tele&#xAD;vi&#xAD;sion last Fri&#xAD;day turned out to be fake as only Van Ness Wu (above, ex&#xAD;treme right) was pre&#xAD;sent on stage.</p>
