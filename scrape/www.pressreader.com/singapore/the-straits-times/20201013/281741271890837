    <p>NEW YORK The au­thor­i­ties i n New York City cracked down this past week­end on some coro­n­avirus hot spots, is­su­ing more than 60 sum­monses and tens of thou­sands of dol­lars in fines to peo­ple, busi­nesses and houses of wor­ship that did not fol­low newly im­posed re­stric­tions on gath­er­ings or mask wear­ing and so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Among those is­sued a sum­mons by the New York City sher­iff were a restau­rant and at least five houses of wor­ship in the city’s “red zones”, where coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion rates are the high­est. Each of those lo­ca­tions was given a sum­mons that could re­sult in up to US$15,000 (S$20,300) in fines, said Sher­iff Joseph Fucito.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, of­fi­cials is­sued 62 tick­ets and more than US$150,000 in fines dur­ing the first week­end the new re­stric­tions were in ef­fect, the Twit­ter ac­count of the New York City gov­ern­ment said on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The city is wrestling with its most acute pan­demic cri­sis since the virus first swept through its five bor­oughs in March. Since mid-Au­gust, city and state of­fi­cials say, large gath­er­ings and lax so­cial dis­tanc­ing have caused a surge in new cases in pock­ets of Brook­lyn and Queens, many of them in Ortho­dox Jewish neigh­bour­hoods.</p>
    <p>The spike prompted Gov­er­nor An­drew Cuomo to is­sue new re­stric­tions on large gath­er­ings and nonessen­tial busi­nesses in cer­tain parts of the city.</p>
    <p>The mo­ment has set an al­ready anx­ious city on edge, par­tic­u­larly as doc­tors, ex­perts and health of­fi­cials ex­press grow­ing con­cern about a sec­ond wave of the virus this win­ter. It has also un­der­scored the chal­lenges that of­fi­cials will face as they try to quash emerg­ing hot spots in small com­mu­ni­ties be­fore the virus can spread into the rest of the city.</p>
    <p>When Mr Cuomo an­nounced a new ex­ec­u­tive or­der im­pos­ing the re­stric­tions last week, some re­li­gious lead­ers ex­pressed staunch op­po­si­tion, even as case numbers con­tin­ued climb­ing in pock­ets of Brook­lyn and Queens that are home to large pop­u­la­tions of Ortho­dox Jews.</p>
    <p>The Ortho­dox Jewish com­mu­nity was dev­as­tated by the coro­n­avirus in the spring, when lo­cal of­fi­cials and ul­tra-Ortho­dox news or­gan­i­sa­tions said hun­dreds of peo­ple might have died, in­clud­ing beloved re­li­gious lead­ers.</p>
    <p>The new re­stric­tions are the most sig­nif­i­cant set­back yet in the city’s re­cov­ery, rolling back some of the suc­cess­ful re­open­ings that much of New York has em­braced since the most re­stric­tive early days of the pan­demic this spring.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Mr Cuomo’s ex­ec­u­tive or­der, in neigh­bour­hoods with the high­est in­fec­tion rates – or “red zones” – houses of wor­ship are lim­ited to 25 per cent ca­pac­ity or a max­i­mum of 10 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Else­where, where rates are lower but still alarm­ing, “orange zones” are lim­ited to 33 per cent ca­pac­ity and “yel­low zones” to 50 per cent ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>“I un­der­stand the de­sire to hold large re­li­gious cer­e­monies. I un­der­stand how im­por­tant it is to their cul­ture and to their re­li­gion,” Mr Cuomo said on a phone call with re­porters on Sun­day. “I also un­der­stand that it, as a mat­ter of fact, jeop­ar­dises hu­man life.”</p>
    <p>The gov­er­nor also urged rab­bis and other Jewish lead­ers to en­cour­age their con­gre­gants to stay home amid re­ports that many syn­a­gogues had openly de­fied the state’s or­der and had held ser­vices in per­son.</p>
    <p>A na­tional Ortho­dox or­gan­i­sa­tion has filed a law­suit in fed­eral court chal­leng­ing the con­sti­tu­tion­al­ity of the new rules. But last Fri­day, a fed­eral court ruled the new state rules could move for­ward, cit­ing of­fi­cials’ re­spon­si­bil­ity to keep “all New York­ers” safe.</p>
    <p>The Catholic dio­cese of Brook­lyn filed a sep­a­rate law­suit ob­ject­ing to the new re­stric­tions, which it said would force sev­eral churches in the bor­ough to close. A judge in that case also ruled that the gov­er­nor’s or­der could move for­ward.</p>
