    <p>All laws, what makes for a crime and what an ap­pro­pri­ate sen­tence should be for a crime must re­flect the val­ues and the so­cial mores of Sin­ga­pore’s so­ci­ety, said Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“The crimes and the sen­tence must there­fore res­onate with th­ese val­ues in so­ci­ety,” said Mr Tong, who is also Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Law.</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing at the start of a vir­tual di­a­logue with 50 peo­ple aged be­tween 15 and 35 in which they dis­cussed Sin­ga­pore’s crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem and the sen­tenc­ing frame­work for caus­ing hurt as well as sex­ual of­fences.</p>
    <p>The di­a­logue was or­gan­ised by the Na­tional Youth Coun­cil (NYC), the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs (MHA) and the Min­istry of Law (MinLaw) to help youth bet­ter un­der­stand the sen­tenc­ing process in the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem and to hear their per­spec­tive on this.</p>
    <p>It fol­lows the case of 23-year-old</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore den­tistry stu­dent Yin Zi Qin who re­ceived com­mu­nity-based sen­tences in July for at­tack­ing his for­mer girl­friend in May last year. He tried to stran­gle her and pressed his thumb against her eye, caus­ing it to bleed.</p>
    <p>The case prompted the Gov­ern­ment to re­view the penalty frame­work in cases sim­i­lar to it.</p>
    <p>NYC said it con­ducted a poll of 500 youth aged 15 to 35 be­tween July 22 and 23 and nine out of 10 of them felt that the sen­tence in the den­tistry case was too le­nient. More than three quar­ters, or 76 per cent, of fe­male par­tic­i­pants polled felt that the acts com­mit­ted by Yin were se­ri­ous and 69 per cent of male re­spon­dents felt the same way.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong said that many peo­ple were dis­ap­pointed with the sen­tence, adding that he un­der­stood the “emo­tions be­hind the sen­ti­ments”.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that the court’s de­ci­sion had to be re­spected, he added: “But, at the same time, we are en­ti­tled to ask: What are the rel­e­vant legal poli­cies on a mat­ter like this, and how do we en­sure that sen­tences are con­sis­tent with so­ci­etal val­ues?”</p>
    <p>Mr Tong also stressed that some of­fend­ers, es­pe­cially those who are young and who com­mit­ted of­fences that are not so se­ri­ous, de­serve a sec­ond chance. He urged the par­tic­i­pants, who com­prised stu­dents and work­ing adults, to dis­cuss which cases should have an op­tion for re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion and the role it plays in Sin­ga­pore’s sen­tenc­ing regime.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the di­a­logue, one view that emerged was that re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion should be a stronger con­sid­er­a­tion for younger of­fend­ers dur­ing sen­tenc­ing to re­duce their risk of re-of­fend­ing.</p>
    <p>But the se­ri­ous­ness and com­mu­nity im­pact of their of­fences must still be taken into ac­count, said par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>But they also said that so­ci­ety must be more ac­cept­ing of for­mer of­fend­ers, al­low­ing for their rein­te­gra­tion into so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post af­ter the event, Mr Tong said that MHA and MinLaw will take into con­sid­er­a­tion the feed­back shared dur­ing the di­a­logue in their re­view of the sen­tenc­ing frame­work.</p>
    <p>MHA and MinLaw have started work on the re­view and, when it is com­pleted, a min­is­te­rial state­ment will be made in Par­lia­ment.</p>
