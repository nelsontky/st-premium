    <p>•</p>
    <p>Malaysia is short­en­ing the quar­an­tine pe­riod for peo­ple com­ing into the coun­try to 10 days, from 14, start­ing to­day.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry’s di­rec­tor­gen­eral Noor Hisham Ab­dul­lah said the de­ci­sion to shorten the quar­an­tine pe­riod is based on the lat­est sci­en­tific ev­i­dence and prac­tices in other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“The mon­i­tor­ing and ob­ser­va­tion pe­riod for trav­ellers from abroad, as well as close con­tact trac­ing man­age­ment, will be short­ened to 10 days in­stead of 14 days,” he said at his daily Covid-19 brief­ing.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Noor Hisham said sev­eral coun­tries have re­viewed their manda­tory quar­an­tine pe­ri­ods and have short­ened them from the ini­tial 14 days.</p>
    <p>He said Bri­tain, Ger­many and Bel­gium have short­ened the quar­an­tine pe­riod to 10 days, while in France, it is only seven days.“The high­est risk of in­fec­tion is in the first week of ex­po­sure,” he added.</p>
    <p>The 14-day quar­an­tine was rec­om­mended af­ter the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion and other ex­perts es­ti­mated that the in­cu­ba­tion pe­riod is be­tween two days and 14 days. Stud­ies sug­gest that the av­er­age time for symp­toms to ap­pear af­ter ex­po­sure is five days.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin said yes­ter­day that the govern­ment is plan­ning to buy more Covid-19 vac­cine doses to cover the im­mu­ni­sa­tion needs of about 60 per cent to 70 per cent of Malaysians com­pared with the 30 per cent cov­er­age now.</p>
    <p>“We have al­ready got 30 per cent. I have in­structed Health Min­is­ter Ad­ham Baba and Khairy Ja­malud­din to ne­go­ti­ate and in­crease it from 30 per cent to 60 or 70 per cent,” Tan Sri Muhyid­din said, re­fer­ring to the vac­cine. Mr Khairy is the Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and In­no­va­tion Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Sup­pli­ers have also been asked to ex­pe­dite de­liv­ery of the vac­cine, which is sched­uled to ar­rive in March. Malaysia has a pop­u­la­tion of 32 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Muhyid­din or­dered all tem­po­rary hos­pi­tals for Covid-19 to re­open due to con­tin­ued spikes in cases in Se­lan­gor, the fed­eral ter­ri­to­ries, Negeri Sem­bi­lan and Jo­hor.</p>
