    <p>MOSCOW • Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin yes­ter­day signed an ar­ray of laws hand­ing the coun­try new pow­ers to re­strict United States so­cial me­dia gi­ants, la­bel in­di­vid­u­als “for­eign agents”, and crack down on the dis­clo­sure of its se­cu­rity of­fi­cers’ per­sonal data.</p>
    <p>The laws, which also in­tro­duce new re­stric­tions for protests, cap a year of con­sti­tu­tional re­forms al­low­ing Mr Putin, 68, to stand for two more six-year terms in the Krem­lin in­stead of step­ping down in 2024 as he had been legally re­quired to do.</p>
    <p>Other re­forms such as one grant­ing for­mer pres­i­dents life­long im­mu­nity from pros­e­cu­tion have kept an­a­lysts guess­ing about his plans as Moscow’s ties with the West have come un­der new strain over the poi­son­ing of Krem­lin critic Alexei Navalny.</p>
    <p>One of the laws en­ables Rus­sia to block or re­strict ac­cess to sites that “dis­crim­i­nate” against its me­dia, part of a cam­paign un­der Mr Putin to in­crease Rus­sia’s In­ter­net “sovereignt­y”.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter cur­rently la­bels some Rus­sian me­dia “state-af­fil­i­ated me­dia”, a move de­cried by Moscow. The law’s back­ers cited com­plaints of prej­u­dice shown by Face­book, Twit­ter and YouTube.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond law in­tro­duces hefty fines of up to 20 per cent of Rus­sia-based turnover for sites that re­peat­edly fail to re­move banned con­tent, some­thing YouTube and Face­book have of­ten failed to do.</p>
    <p>A third law pro­hibits the dis­clo­sure of the per­sonal data of Rus­sian se­cu­rity of­fi­cials, records that are some­times leaked on­line and have been used by jour­nal­ists to track clan­des­tine op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>In­ves­tiga­tive web­site Belling­cat this month used flight records and other data to iden­tify a group of al­leged Fed­eral Se­cu­rity Ser­vice agents whom Mr Navalny has ac­cused of try­ing to poi­son him, an al­le­ga­tion de­nied by Moscow.</p>
    <p>Other new laws in­tro­duced jail sen­tences of up to two years for slan­der on­line, as well as new rules that ban the fund­ing of protests by “for­eign agents” and al­low ral­lies to be banned due to emer­gen­cies.</p>
    <p>An­other law granted new pow­ers to la­bel in­di­vid­u­als as “for­eign agents” and jail them for five years if they fail to re­port their ac­tiv­i­ties cor­rectly.</p>
