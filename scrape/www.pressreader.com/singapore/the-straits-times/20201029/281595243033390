    <p>Some users are al­legedly tam­per­ing with their TraceTo­gether to­kens. But do­ing so is not only a crime, it also puts Sin­ga­pore at risk as it can ham­per con­tact trac­ing, said a Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment Group spokesman.</p>
    <p>Some users are al­legedly break­ing open their TraceTo­gether to­kens, re­mov­ing the bat­tery and even swop­ping the QR code with that of another de­vice.</p>
    <p>But do­ing so is not only a crime, it also puts Sin­ga­pore at risk.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from The New Pa­per, a Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment Group spokesman said it was aware of on­line fo­rums where users claimed to have mod­i­fied the to­ken.</p>
    <p>“Any de­lib­er­ate or mis­chievous act to tam­per the to­ken is a crim­i­nal of­fence un­der the Com­puter Mis­use Act,” he said.</p>
    <p>More than 400,000 to­kens have been col­lected since dis­tri­bu­tion be­gan last month.</p>
    <p>The spokesman said TraceTo­gether has helped cut the time to iden­tify close con­tacts from four days to less than two days. But tam­per­ing with the to­ken can ham­per con­tact trac­ing, he added.</p>
    <p>On Oct 20, the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling Covid-19 said check­ing in with TraceTo­gether will be manda­tory at all pub­lic venues by end-De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>A thread on on­line forum Hard­wareZone on the same day dis­cussed how to mod­ify the to­kens.</p>
    <p>A user en­cour­aged oth­ers to print QR codes from other to­kens to stick on their own. The QR code, found on the back of the de­vice, is unique to each to­ken.</p>
    <p>The thread, which has gained trac­tion, with over 780 posts as at Mon­day, saw other users dis­cussing how to block the Blue­tooth sig­nal to pre­vent it from work­ing as in­tended.</p>
    <p>Many of the users ap­peared to be against the use of the to­kens.</p>
    <p>Some peo­ple had raised con­cerns about lo­ca­tion track­ing and sur­veil­lance when the to­kens were an­nounced in June.</p>
    <p>But the au­thor­i­ties have re­as­sured the pub­lic that the to­kens do not col­lect lo­ca­tion data and are used only for con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment Tech­nol­ogy Agency also in­vited four ex­perts to a tear­down of the to­ken in June to check the in­ner work­ings of the de­vice.</p>
    <p>One of them, Mr Roland Turner, the chief pri­vacy of­fi­cer for an­a­lyt­ics com­pany TrustSpher­e, told The New Pa­per that peo­ple should not be wor­ried about us­ing the to­ken.</p>
    <p>“TraceTo­gether keeps the in­for­ma­tion that it col­lects on the de­vice un­til you are di­ag­nosed, and purges any­thing more than 25 days old,” he said. “This means more than 99.9 per cent of data col­lected never en­ters gov­ern­ment hands.”</p>
    <p>Not­ing that the suc­cess of TraceTo­gether in fight­ing Covid-19 de­pends on peo­ple’s co­op­er­a­tion, he added: “Like fre­quent hand wash­ing, TraceTo­gether can gain wide­spread use and high ef­fec­tive­ness only if the pop­u­la­tion wants to do it.</p>
    <p>“It is worth tak­ing ev­ery fea­si­ble step to en­cour­age this.”</p>
    <p>Lawyer Joshua Tong from Kalco Law said those who tam­per with the to­kens may run afoul of sev­eral laws.</p>
    <p>“If there is phys­i­cal dam­age or al­ter­ations to the to­kens, one may be li­able for an of­fence of mis­chief.”</p>
    <p>The of­fence car­ries a jail term of up to two years, a fine, or both.</p>
    <p>If the mis­chief dis­rupts a pub­lic health ser­vice, one can be charged with mis­chief caus­ing dis­rup­tion to a key ser­vice, which car­ries a jail term of up to 10 years, a fine, or both.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong said: “This is be­cause the</p>
    <p>TraceTo­gether to­kens pro­vide a ser­vice... (that) is crit­i­cal to main­tain­ing pub­lic health by com­bat­ing the pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Un­der the Com­puter Mis­use Act, unau­tho­rised ac­cess to com­puter ma­te­rial car­ries a jail term of up to two years, a fine of up to $5,000, or both.</p>
    <p>Those who make unau­tho­rised mod­i­fi­ca­tions to com­puter ma­te­rial can be jailed for up to three years, fined up to $10,000, or both.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tious dis­ease spe­cial­ist Leong Hoe Nam said those who tam­per with the to­ken are ir­re­spon­si­ble and put oth­ers at risk.</p>
    <p>He said: “Ma­nip­u­lat­ing the to­ken is akin to sab­o­tag­ing your coun­try. Why are they so thick-headed?”</p>
    <p>If there is phys­i­cal dam­age or al­ter­ations to the to­kens, one may be li­able for an of­fence of mis­chief.</p>
