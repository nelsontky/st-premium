    <p>In­vest­ment com­pany Te­masek’s one-year share­holder re­turn fell into neg­a­tive ter­ri­tory in its lat­est fi­nan­cial year, re­flect­ing the im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic on global fi­nan­cial mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Its net port­fo­lio value also saw a dip – $306 bil­lion as at March 31 – com­pared with last year’s record high of $313 bil­lion. The one-year re­turn for share­hold­ers came in at mi­nus 2.28 per cent, com­pared with 1.49 per cent the pre­vi­ous year.</p>
    <p>Te­masek’s ex­po­sure in Sin­ga­pore by un­der­ly­ing as­sets has also fallen be­hind that in China for the first time, on the back of rel­a­tive valu­a­tions in the two mar­kets.</p>
    <p>As part of ef­forts by Te­masek to sup­port the na­tion’s fight against the pan­demic, some 11 mil­lion masks were given out to Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents, among other ini­tia­tives, the com­pany noted at its an­nual re­view yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore in­vest­ment com­pany Te­masek’s one-year share­holder re­turn fell into neg­a­tive ter­ri­tory in its lat­est fi­nan­cial year, with the firm’s net port­fo­lio value like­wise tak­ing a dip from the year be­fore.</p>
    <p>Te­masek’s net port­fo­lio was val­ued at $306 bil­lion as at March 31, 2020. That is 2.2 per cent lower than last year’s record $313 bil­lion, the com­pany said in its an­nual re­view yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Te­masek’s re­ported re­sults yes­ter­day, which con­firm the pre­lim­i­nary fig­ures re­leased in July, re­flected the im­pact of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic on global fi­nan­cial mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Its one-year re­turn for share­hold­ers came in at mi­nus 2.28 per cent, com­pared with 1.49 per cent the pre­vi­ous year. Over the longer term, its to­tal share­holder re­turn over 10 years was 5 per cent, down from 9 per cent a year ago.</p>
    <p>Un­listed as­sets made up 48 per cent of Te­masek’s port­fo­lio in the past fi­nan­cial year – their high­est recorded share – as the in­vest­ment firm con­tin­ues to in­crease its ex­po­sure in non-listed com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeoh Keat Chuan, se­nior man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Te­masek In­ter­na­tional’s en­ter­prise devel­op­ment group and deputy head for Sin­ga­pore projects, noted that the per­cent­age of un­listed as­sets in Te­masek’s port­fo­lio has grown steadily over the years.</p>
    <p>He added that un­listed as­sets ac­counted for just 23 per cent of the com­pany’s port­fo­lio in 2010.</p>
    <p>Among some of Te­masek’s un­listed as­sets are port oper­a­tor PSA In­ter­na­tional and real es­tate player Maple­tree In­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>“(This high per­cent­age of un­listed as­sets) is very much in line with the struc­tural trends that we are see­ing... and that is where op­por­tu­ni­ties lie,” Mr Yeoh said.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial ser­vices re­mained the largest sec­tor in Te­masek’s port­fo­lio at 23 per cent, as it in­creased ex­po­sure in the pay­ments sec­tor and other non-bank fi­nan­cial ser­vices com­pa­nies to ben­e­fit from the ac­cel­er­at­ing dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion of the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, Te­masek in­creased its in­vest­ments in pay­ment providers Pay­Pal, Master­card and Visa, and also put money in Blend, a United States-based dig­i­tal lend­ing plat­form for mort­gages and con­sumer bank­ing.</p>
    <p>Sus­tain­abil­ity also re­mains a key fo­cus for Te­masek, as it closed the year achiev­ing car­bon neu­tral­ity as a com­pany.</p>
    <p>Te­masek In­ter­na­tional chief ex­ec­u­tive Dil­han Pil­lay said: “We recog­nise the ur­gent need for busi­nesses with in­no­va­tive so­lu­tions to im­prove lives and in­crease so­cial re­silience. This has led us to ac­cel­er­ate our i nvest­ments i nto l owe­mis­sion and re­source-ef­fi­cient com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing in the ar­eas of en­ergy, food, waste, wa­ter, mo­bil­ity and ur­ban devel­op­ment.”</p>
    <p>In the past year, Te­masek backed Sin­ga­pore-based so­lar en­ergy firm Sun­seap and in­creased its ex­po­sure to al­ter­na­tive pro­tein firms such as Im­pos­si­ble Foods and Per­fect Day.</p>
    <p>Te­masek has also been ac­tive in the tech­nol­ogy and life sciences sec­tors over the past fi­nan­cial year, cap­i­tal­is­ing on growth trends in th­ese ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Among its new port­fo­lio com­pa­nies are Duck Creek Tech­nolo­gies, a soft­ware provider to the prop­erty and ca­su­alty in­sur­ance in­dus­try, and in­te­grated health­care sys­tem CareBridge.</p>
    <p>CIMB Pri­vate Bank­ing econ­o­mist Song Seng Wun said Te­masek’s re­sults, like all com­pa­nies whose fi­nan­cial year ends in March, were in­evitably af­fected by the market plunge that month.</p>
    <p>“This is es­pe­cially so for Te­masek, where most of its port­fo­lio is in eq­ui­ties. From a legacy stand­point, it still holds a large chunk of Sin­ga­pore eq­ui­ties, such as through the (lo­cal) banks and Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA),” he said.</p>
    <p>Te­masek i nvested $32 bil­lion over the past fis­cal year and di­vested $26 bil­lion of as­sets dur­ing that time. This in­vest­ment amount was larger than the pre­vi­ous year’s $24 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Mr Song said there could be op­por­tu­ni­ties for fur­ther in­vest­ments for Te­masek. “Any time there is a market cor­rec­tion, it cre­ates op­por­tu­nity,” he added, but cau­tioned that there are also chal­lenges, given that mar­kets out­side the US have re­bounded sharply.</p>
    <p>At yes­ter­day’s vir­tual press con­fer­ence, Mr Pil­lay ad­dressed a ques­tion on Te­masek’s plans for two of its port­fo­lio com­pa­nies – off­shore and marine play­ers Kep­pel Corp and Sem­b­corp Marine. He said: “It is not re­ally for us to di­rect things at all, that is not our gov­er­nance frame­work.”</p>
    <p>Both Kep­pel and Sem­bMarine are listed com­pa­nies, and it is up to the two boards to de­cide what each com­pany’s busi­ness mod­els are go­ing to be, Mr Pil­lay added.</p>
    <p>Te­masek with­drew its par­tial of­fer for Kep­pel last month and has mopped up one bil­lion of Sem­bMarine’s un­sub­scribed rights shares.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to whether Te­masek would be keen to lead an­other round of fund-rais­ing for SIA, fol­low­ing its rights is­sue of shares ear­lier this year, Mr Pil­lay replied: “As of now, I think SIA is man­ag­ing its capital the best it can.”</p>
    <p>Point­ing out SIA’s strengths and in­ter­na­tional rep­u­ta­tion, he added: “They have a re­silient work­force, and I be­lieve when the post(Covid-19) world al­lows travel to come back in, they will be able to con­tinue to op­er­ate the same way as they did be­fore, al­beit within a dif­fer­ent en­vi­ron­ment.”</p>
    <p>Te­masek deputy chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer and head of fi­nan­cial ser­vices Png Chin Yee said the un­pre­dictabil­ity of Covid-19 and geopo­lit­i­cal is­sues pose near-term chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>“We will stay watch­ful and re­main dis­ci­plined in our in­vest­ment ap­proach as we fo­cus on build­ing a port­fo­lio that will ben­e­fit from pol­icy tail­winds and is re­silient in the long term,” she said.</p>
