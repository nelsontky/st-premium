    <p>They may leave a mess of toys, dan­der and drool in their wake, but there’s no deny­ing that pets hold a spe­cial place in our hearts. Smit­ten pet own­ers are why lo­cal pet sup­plies chain Pet Lovers Cen­tre (PLC) strives to im­prove its ser­vices and op­er­a­tions reg­u­larly.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, the com­pany ren­o­vated one of its three 35,000 sq ft (3,250 sq m) ware­houses in Yishun to up­date it with a brand-new $2.5 mil­lion au­to­mated stor­age and retrieval sys­tem that would speed up the facility ’s op­er­a­tions and im­prove its staff ’s pro­duc­tiv­ity. The new ware­house re-opened in June.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the au­to­mated sys­tem was in­stalled, em­ploy­ees had to man­u­ally lo­cate and re­trieve items from shelves across the ex­pan­sive ware­house.</p>
    <p>Now, em­ploy­ees merely press a few but­tons on a tablet or desk­top com­puter and — voila — a ro­bot re­trieves the prod­ucts they want and de­liv­ers it to them.</p>
    <p>The cut­ting-edge sys­tem, de­vel­oped with help from en­ter­prise de­vel­op­ment agency En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG), has dou­bled the com­pany ’s pro­duc­tiv­ity and ware­house stor­age ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>It can now store and re­trieve 50 pal­lets an hour with the help of the au­to­mated stor­age and retrieval sys­tem, com­pared to just 15 pal­lets per hour if the work was done man­u­ally. The new ware­house also has more stor­age space than the other two.</p>
    <p>“With the ro­bots, our staff no longer need to op­er­ate fork­lifts in the ware­house for long hours and can focus on ful­fill­ing or­ders,” says PLC’s group lo­gis­tics man­ager Kelvin Foo.</p>
    <p>The 52-year-old adds that em­ploy­ees had to un­dergo a 19-day train­ing pro­gramme to learn how to use the new sys­tem, which helped to build confidence and staff morale.</p>
    <p>For years, the com­pany, one of Sin­ga­pore’s old­est and largest pet sup­plies stores, has had a keen eye for tech­nolo­gies that would help it grow and pre­pare for the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been dig­i­tal­is­ing since 2003 when we started in­vest­ing in e-com­merce op­er­a­tions,” says chief ex­ec­u­tive David Ng.</p>
    <p>That fore­sight helped it weather the AprilJune cir­cuit breaker, when it had to close all 70 of its phys­i­cal stores here.</p>
    <p>“Un­like other pet stores that had their sales come to a com­plete halt, we were able to take or­ders through our web­site due to our early e-com­merce in­vest­ment,” shares the 52-year-old.</p>
    <p>The firm’s daily online or­ders surged up to 18 times more dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker. While this was not enough to re­place the loss of sales from its brick-and-mor­tar stores, it was a lifeline.</p>
    <p>The com­pany re­tained all 500 em­ploy­ees by re­de­ploy­ing some of them to its ware­houses and cus­tomer ser­vice depart­ment, and also hired tem­po­rary staff to ful­fil online or­ders.</p>
    <p>“The dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion projects that we car­ried out ear­lier, such as in­stalling a com­pre­hen­sive in­tranet sys­tem, also en­abled the ma­jor­ity of our of­fice staff to work from home,” says Mr Ng.</p>
    <p>Adding to that, the com­pany has been in­vest­ing in staff train­ing in ar­eas like prod­uct knowl­edge and cus­tomer ser­vice since 2003.</p>
    <p>“We also hired sev­eral se­nior man­agers dur­ing this pan­demic to help us grow. Our man­age­ment team is now stronger than ever,” he ex­plains.</p>
    <p>Un­like other pet stores that had their sales come to a com­plete halt, we were able to take or­ders through our web­site due to our early e-com­merce in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>With cus­tomers hun­ker­ing down dur­ing the na­tion­wide lock­down ear­lier this year, PLC re­alised it had to quickly ad­just its ser­vices to cater to them.</p>
    <p>It in­tro­duced a new com­puter sys­tem to process online or­ders faster in re­sponse to the high vol­ume of or­ders it was re­ceiv­ing via its web­site.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem tracks the avail­abil­ity of prod­ucts and de­ter­mines whether online or­ders can be ful­filled, cut­ting the time needed to process online or­ders from five min­utes to just one minute per or­der.</p>
    <p>Speed was key, says Mr Ng. “Given the vol­ume of online or­ders dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, we had lit­tle time to train re­de­ployed and tem­po­rary staff.</p>
    <p>“The new sys­tem, de­vel­oped in-house by our own en­gi­neers, not only im­proved our pro­cess­ing time but fa­cil­i­tated the quick de­ploy­ment of un­trained staff to process or­ders.”</p>
    <p>The com­puter sys­tem was built with ease of use in mind, he adds. With some train­ing, “any­one who can play a com­puter game” would be able to op­er­ate the sys­tem.</p>
    <p>This has given the com­pany more flex­i­bil­ity to use part-timers if its staff re­quires more help.</p>
    <p>“Should there be an­other cir­cuit breaker, we will be much more ready to use e-com­merce to buf­fer the loss of our brick-and-mor­tar sales,” Mr Ng de­clares.</p>
