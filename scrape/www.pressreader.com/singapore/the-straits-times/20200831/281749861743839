    <p>TAIPEI • A Czech del­e­ga­tion ar­rived in Taipei yes­ter­day in the sec­ond high-pro­file for­eign visit to Tai­wan this month – a set­back for China’s cam­paign to keep the demo­cratic is­land iso­lated from the rest of the world.</p>
    <p>The 90-mem­ber group, led by Se­nate Speaker Mi­los Vys­tr­cil, landed two weeks af­ter United States health chief Alex Azar mar­shalled the high­est-level mis­sion to Tai­wan by Wash­ing­ton since it switched diplo­matic recog­ni­tion to Bei­jing in 1979.</p>
    <p>Mr Vys­tr­cil will de­liver a speech in Tai­wan’s Parliament and meet Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen dur­ing a five-day trip de­scribed by Taipei as stand­ing up to “the in­tim­i­da­tion of au­thor­i­tar­ian China”.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing views Tai­wan as its ter­ri­tory – vow­ing to one day seize it by force if nec­es­sary – and bris­tles at any moves by for­eign gov­ern­ments to recog­nise or con­duct of­fi­cial ex­changes with Taipei.</p>
    <p>It has de­scribed Mr Vys­tr­cil’s visit as a “de­spi­ca­ble act”.</p>
    <p>For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian said last Thurs­day: “His in­sis­tence to go to Tai­wan to carry out this so-called ‘visit’ de­lib­er­ately wrecks the po­lit­i­cal foun­da­tion of</p>
    <p>CHANGE IN STANCE ON CHINA</p>
    <p>I think that as China’s po­si­tions and be­hav­iours on a range of is­sues from Xin­jiang to Hong Kong to the South China Sea di­verge from the val­ues of demo­cratic coun­tries, we will see more politi­cians stand­ing up to say ‘this is ’’ not OK with us’.</p>
    <p>DR JONATHAN SUL­LI­VAN, di­rec­tor of the Univer­sity of Not­ting­ham’s China pro­grammes, on the Czech Repub­lic’s en­gage­ment with Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>China-Czech re­la­tions.”</p>
    <p>China has ramped up diplo­matic, mil­i­tary and eco­nomic pres­sure on Tai­wan since Ms Tsai came to power in 2016 as she views the is­land as a sov­er­eign na­tion and not part of “one China”.</p>
    <p>Ms Tsai won a land­slide re-elec­tion vic­tory in Jan­uary, and a growing num­ber of coun­tries are ex­pand­ing ties with the is­land, es­pe­cially those wary of China’s in­creas­ingly mus­cu­lar for­eign pol­icy.</p>
    <p>The Czech Repub­lic is one such coun­try. Ear­lier this year, the city of Prague sparked Bei­jing’s ire by sign­ing a part­ner­ship agree­ment with Taipei that prompted Shang­hai to cut ties as a sis­ter city.</p>
    <p>Prague Mayor Zdenek Hrib, who signed the agree­ment, is in this week’s del­e­ga­tion to Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>Dr Fabrizio Boz­zato, a Taipeibase­d in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions ex­pert with the Univer­sity of Rome La Sapienza, said the Czech visit shows that “the po­lit­i­cal-diplo­matic wall that Bei­jing has tried to build all around the is­land is not im­pass­able”.</p>
    <p>He said: “Such openly de­fi­ant ini­tia­tives also sig­nal that, even in Europe, the zeit­geist is chang­ing from ‘Bei­jing con­sen­sus’ to ‘re­sist­ing Bei­jing’.”</p>
    <p>Dr Jonathan Sul­li­van, di­rec­tor of the Univer­sity of Not­ting­ham’s China pro­grammes, said Ms Tsai has pushed to build con­nec­tions with coun­tries it has “in­for­mal” re­la­tions with. The Czech visit, he said, was “a psy­cho­log­i­cal boost dur­ing con­tin­ued pres­sures and marginal­i­sa­tion” by Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>“But such pub­lic demon­stra­tions of sup­port and en­gage­ment with Tai­wan are not go­ing to be­come typ­i­cal overnight,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mod­ern-day Tai­wan has been ruled sep­a­rately from China since the end of a civil war in 1949.</p>
    <p>For decades, it was a harsh au­toc­racy like China. But since the late 1990s, it has evolved into one of Asia’s most pro­gres­sive democ­ra­cies. Last year, it be­came the first in Asia to le­galise gay mar­riage.</p>
    <p>Ms Tsai has mar­keted the is­land as a pro­gres­sive demo­cratic ally to other na­tions, hop­ing to push back against Bei­jing. That push has been fur­ther helped by Tai­wan’s ef­fec­tive han­dling of the Covid-19 pan­demic and its global aid ship­ments of per­sonal pro­tec­tion equip­ment.</p>
    <p>In a speech to an Aus­tralian think­tank last week, Ms Tsai de­scribed</p>
    <p>Tai­wan as be­ing “on the front line of free­dom and democ­racy” as China cracks down on dis­sent in nearby Hong Kong and else­where.</p>
    <p>Dr Sul­li­van said: “I think that as China’s po­si­tions and be­hav­iours on a range of is­sues from Xin­jiang to Hong Kong to the South China Sea di­verge from the val­ues of demo­cratic coun­tries, we will see more politi­cians stand­ing up to say ‘this is not OK with us’.”</p>
    <p>The Czech Repub­lic ex­pe­ri­enced decades of au­thor­i­tar­ian Soviet Union rule.</p>
    <p>Mr Vys­tr­cil has said his Tai­wan trip will ful­fil the legacy of the late pres­i­dent Va­clav Havel, a dis­si­dent leader of the 1989 Vel­vet Rev­o­lu­tion which top­pled com­mu­nism in the former Cze­choslo­vakia.</p>
