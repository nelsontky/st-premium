    <p>Since May, 71-year-old Mr Koh Kok Weng has solem­nised 109 wed­dings through video con­fer­enc­ing plat­form Zoom, amid the health pre­cau­tions re­quired by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Many of these in­volved cou­ples who had ini­tially sched­uled their wed­dings dur­ing that time but agreed to have them online in­stead.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh says: “It’s heart-warm­ing to see these fam­i­lies united, es­pe­cially for those who have rel­a­tives stay­ing over­seas, who would other­wise not have been able to at­tend a phys­i­cal wed­ding. So it’s nice to see them all in one Zoom ‘room’ wit­ness­ing a happy oc­ca­sion.”</p>
    <p>Of the 109 wed­dings he has</p>
    <p>Times are tough amid the Covid-19 pan­demic for Pong­gol Seafood, a fam­ily-run restau­rant fa­mous for its chilli crab and mee goreng that has been around since 1969.</p>
    <p>Mr Ting Cheng Ping, 57, the restau­rant’s man­ager and son of its late founder, Mr Ting Choon Teng, de­scribes the last few months as “dis­as­trous”.</p>
    <p>The restau­rant at The Pung­gol Set­tle­ment near Pung­gol Point Jetty has been strug­gling to break even since March, when the coron</p>
    <p>When Covid-19 struck, 46-year-old Maryann Sheila – a front-line reg­is­tra­tion worker at an or­thopaedic clinic in Tan Tock Seng Hospi­tal (TTSH) – rose to the oc­ca­sion.</p>
    <p>She vol­un­teered to switch jobs and reg­is­ter peo­ple who had to be solem­nised through Zoom, around 10 in­volved cou­ples with fam­ily mem­bers stay­ing over­seas and were most likely un­able to at­tend a phys­i­cal wed­ding if it were held, ow­ing to travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>On the other ad­van­tages of Zoom, he says: “Many of these cou­ples wanted to get mar­ried and start a new life to­gether, so they didn’t wish to de­lay their wed­dings. I’m glad to be part of this im­por­tant mile­stone of their jour­ney ahead of them.”</p>
    <p>De­spite be­ing a veteran, Mr Koh recog­nises the im­por­tance of con­tin­ued learn­ing and up­skilling, which gave him the fore­sight to learn the ropes of video-con­fer­enc­ing tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>He was among the first to be trained in con­duct­ing video-link solem­ni­sa­tions un­der the Registry of Mar­riages, be­fore Covid-19 even reared its head.</p>
    <p>Since be­ing ap­pointed a solem­niser in 1992, Mr Koh has of­fi­ci­ated at 1,654 wed­dings.</p>
    <p>He also teaches first-aid train­ing at the Sin­ga­pore Red Cross Academy. He started as a vol­un­teer there in 1989, and ever since he has avirus widened its spread here.</p>
    <p>When The Sun­day Times in­ter­viewed Mr Ting back in 2010 for a Na­tional Day spe­cial, Mr Ting talked about how sad the fam­ily was when the restau­rant had to leave its orig­i­nal lo­ca­tion in Pung­gol Point, shift­ing sev­eral times be­fore it moved to its new lo­ca­tion at that time, Ma­rina Coun­try Club.</p>
    <p>In 2014, the restau­rant re­turned to Pung­gol Point, but about 100m from where it first be­gan, Mr Ting re­calls now.</p>
    <p>Yet busi­ness was dif­fi­cult even be­fore Covid-19, as the new malls in the area drew away cus­tomers, and swabbed for Covid-19 at the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases (NCID) screen­ing cen­tre.</p>
    <p>This meant ir­reg­u­lar work­ing hours and more hec­tic shifts, but Ms Sheila, who took up the stint in Fe­bru­ary, re­mained un­fazed.</p>
    <p>“I had the full sup­port of my fam­ily to step up and help amid the pan­demic, and it was this which kept been cov­er­ing na­tional and com­mu­nity events as a first-aider, and also vol­un­teered as an am­bu­lance driver in the early 1990s.</p>
    <p>But his hu­man­i­tar­ian and vol­un­teer­ing work over the decades goes be­yond the Red Cross. Mr Koh has been lauded for his com­mu­nity ser­vice ef­forts as a grass­roots leader, be­gin­ning in 1976. He still con­tin­ues to vol­un­teer as a grass­roots mem­ber at the same Jalan Be­sar Com­mu­nity Club where he started.</p>
    <p>Over the years, he has been pre­sented with sev­eral Na­tional Day awards in­clud­ing the Pub­lic Ser­vice Star in 2007 and the Pub­lic Ser­vice Medal in 1991 for his grass­roots con­tri­bu­tions.</p>
    <p>But this year’s Na­tional Day has a more ex­cit­ing slant, as Mr Koh has been in­vited to at­tend the An­them mo­ment cer­e­mony at the En­abling Vil­lage, in the spirit of Na­tional Day cel­e­bra­tions.</p>
    <p>Though he was in­vited as an hon­orary guest to Na­tional Day pa­rades in the past, Mr Koh says he is “hum­bled and hon­oured” to take part today.</p>

    <p>road works in the vicin­ity re­sulted in some cus­tomers get­ting lost, adds Mr Ting.</p>
    <p>One of the big­gest changes in the past 10 years is com­pe­ti­tion not just from seafood restau­rant chains like Jumbo and Long Beach, but also from new cuisines, like mala xi­ang­guo (spicy stir fry).</p>
    <p>That is why the restau­rant has to come up with new ideas, such as re­vamp­ing its menu when needed, says Mr Ting. It re­cently added tanghoon crab to the menu.</p>
    <p>Although the com­ing home of sorts has not been easy, the Tings are not throw­ing in the towel. me go­ing,” says the mother of two sons, aged 23 and 11.</p>
    <p>The peak of the out­break in April some­times saw over a hun­dred peo­ple in a sin­gle day queue­ing to be reg­is­tered for their swab tests.</p>
    <p>“It was im­por­tant for us to work quickly and ef­fi­ciently, to reg­is­ter their de­tails and pro­vide them with pa­tient tags be­fore they were</p>
    <p>For ded­i­cated ca­reer ad­viser Fauzyah Jo­hari, work does not end when a client lands a job.</p>
    <p>She of­ten checks in with them on how they are cop­ing with work and of­fers ad­vice on up­grad­ing their skills to re­main rel­e­vant.</p>
    <p>Re­la­tion­ship build­ing is im­por­tant for Ms Fauzyah, 35, who has been in this role – of­fi­cially, a “se­nior ca­reer am­bas­sador” – for three years and who is the first point of con­tact for job seek­ers. She works at the Work­force Sin­ga­pore’s (WSG) Ca­reers Con­nect cen­tre at Our Tampines Hub.</p>
    <p>When din­ing in was not al­lowed ear­lier this year, they con­tin­ued with take­away and home de­liv­ery ser­vices – rolled out in 2003 dur­ing the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­handed over to nurses,” says Ms Sheila, whose pre­vi­ous work in­volved reg­is­ter­ing pa­tients as a se­nior pa­tient ser­vice as­so­ciate at TTSH’s Or­thopaedic Spe­cial­ist Out­pa­tient Clinic. She joined two years ago.</p>
    <p>For her ef­forts on the front line, she will be tak­ing part in the Na­tional Day cel­e­bra­tions by at­tend</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to the pan­demic’s toll on the labour mar­ket, Ms Fauzyah, who is mar­ried and has three chil­dren, says: “It’s about putting my­self in their shoes. I try to un­der­stand their stress and dif­fi­cul­ties, es­pe­cially with the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion, and to be a lis­ten­ing ear.”</p>
    <p>She is among those from the em­ploy­ment and skills sec­tor in­vited to at­tend a flag-rais­ing cer­e­mony at the Lifelong Learn­ing In­sti­tute. The event is part of the Na­tional Day Pa­rade’s An­them mo­ment un­fold­ing at sev­eral lo­ca­tions across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Ms Fauzyah has seen more clients in re­cent months amid the eco­nomic down­turn. Un­em­ploy­ment and re­trench­ments surged be­tween April and June.</p>
    <p>As part of her job, she asks clients about their needs and pref­er­ences in their job search. For ex­am­ple, she has to un­der­stand if they were re­trenched or had re­signed, and if they would like to make a ca­reer switch.</p>
    <p>She then rec­om­mends re­sources they can tap to find em­ploy­ment, such as job portals like My­ca­reers­fu­ture.sg, schemes and cour­ses drome out­break.</p>
    <p>They have of­fers, like sell­ing smaller crabs at a fixed price, and credit card pro­mo­tions, says Mr Ting. They also tap new medi­ums ing the An­them mo­ment cer­e­mony at TTSH to mark the ef­forts of health­care work­ers. Dur­ing the cer­e­mony, she will raise the hospi­tal’s flag.</p>
    <p>“Tra­di­tion­ally, I’ve al­ways spent Na­tional Day at home with my fam­ily where we watch the pa­rade live to­gether, but this year, I’m hon­oured to be rep­re­sent­ing Tan Tock they can at­tend to ac­quire new skills.</p>
    <p>Ms Fauzyah also helps them to pol­ish their re­sumes by point­ing out gaps in job de­scrip­tions or giv­ing tips on how they can im­prove the for­mat.</p>
    <p>If clients need more in-depth ad­vice, she refers them to a ca­reer coach who can help them in ar­eas such as con­fi­dence build­ing and strate­gies to net­work with po­ten­tial em­ploy­ers. The first ses­sion with a client usu­ally lasts half an hour, either vir­tu­ally or in per­son.</p>
    <p>Ms Fauzyah, who pre­vi­ously held ad­min­is­tra­tive roles at WSG, re­calls a re­cent client who, in her late 60s, found a job as a con­do­minium se­cu­rity of­fi­cer af­ter she was re­trenched from her cus­tomer ser­vice role. She has kept in touch with the client so she can pro­vide more in­for­ma­tion on job-re­lated pro­grammes if the client needs it.</p>
    <p>“She was happy that she found a job near her place. It’s very ful­fill­ing to meet peo­ple from all walks of life and to be able to make a dif­fer­ence to them.” like Face­book and What­sApp to pro­mote their of­fers. These ef­forts have helped to bring back about 30 per cent of sales, says Mr Ting.</p>
    <p>Fam­ily mem­bers chip in as well – most of Mr Ting’s sib­lings, and even his brother-in-law, are at the restau­rant on week­ends. Ms Ce­cilia Ting, 61, has been tak­ing or­ders, act­ing as cashier, and do­ing odd jobs in the kitchen since 2014.</p>
    <p>She sold her shoe busi­ness last year and now helps out more reg­u­larly. “It’s hard to find staff will­ing to work here, and af­ter all, this is my fa­ther’s busi­ness,” says Ms Ting.</p>
    <p>Mr Ting says he is un­sure who would take over the restau­rant, but plans to stay on as long as he can. His only son, Fabian, 23, has not ex­pressed an in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>He adds: “Now, we are just fo­cus­ing on get­ting through this Covid-19 pan­demic. We hope that a vac­cine can be found, things go back to nor­mal and we can bounce back.”</p>
