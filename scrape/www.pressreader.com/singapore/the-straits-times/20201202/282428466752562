    <p>They may deal with a dif­fer­ently shaped ball, but that did not stop the Sin­ga­pore Rugby Union (SRU) ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee mem­bers from tak­ing time off work to pay their re­spects to the late foot­ball legend Diego Maradona at the Argentine Em­bassy yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>SRU pres­i­dent Ter­ence Khoo, 49, said: “We have been host­ing the HSBC Sin­ga­pore Rugby Sevens here and have a lot of outreach to many in­ter­na­tional teams, in­clud­ing Argentina, who we have a spe­cial bond with. Hence, we want to stand in sol­i­dar­ity with our friends in this time of sad­ness.”</p>
    <p>For­mer SRU vice-pres­i­dent Sunny Seah, 54, noted Maradona’s sup­port for Argentina’s na­tional rugby team af­ter the sport­ing icon vis­ited their dress­ing room at the 2015 Rugby World Cup. SRU vicepres­i­dent David Lim, 49, added: “Maradona tran­scends sports be­cause of the tal­ent, ath­leti­cism, cre­ativ­ity and pas­sion he rep­re­sents.”</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, the Argentine Em­bassy opened two con­do­lence books for peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore to</p>
    <p>pay trib­ute to Maradona at its of­fice in Sun­tec Tower One. Al­most 100 peo­ple – in­clud­ing diplo­mats from var­i­ous coun­tries based here – have signed the books or made ap­point­ments to do so.</p>
    <p>There were also those who went the ex­tra mile and brought bou­quets and hand-made al­bums filled with pho­tos and mag­a­zine cut-outs of the “Golden Boy”.</p>
    <p>While Federico Bart­tfeld, Am­bas­sador of the Argentine Repub­lic to Sin­ga­pore, knew his com­pa­triot was a ge­nius and legend back home, he was sur­prised to learn that many here also hold Maradona in such high re­gard and af­fec­tion. The 51-year-old shared how he came across three teenagers on a morn­ing jog the day af­ter Maradona died, and was told they knew of his prow­ess from their par­ents who idolised the for­mer Barcelona and Napoli star.</p>
    <p>He added: “Nei­ther dis­tance nor cul­tural dif­fer­ences can in­ter­fere with the ad­mi­ra­tion of a man who was able to cre­ate magic with a foot­ball. We are pleased and heart­ened by the recog­ni­tion of Maradona’s per­for­mances.”</p>
    <p>The con­do­lence book will re­main open un­til to­mor­row – from 10am to 1pm and 3pm to 5pm.</p>
    <p>In com­pli­ance with safe dis­tance mea­sures due to Covid-19, the sign­ing will be avail­able only through ap­point­ment by call­ing 6887-9811.</p>
