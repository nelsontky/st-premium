    <p>LON­DON • The English Premier League’s last un­beaten team this sea­son are un­de­feated no more. Goals from James Ward-Prowse and Che Adams sealed a 2-0 win for Southamp­ton against lead­ers Ever­ton yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Tof­fees had gone eight games with­out de­feat in all com­pe­ti­tions this term, but they paid the price for a lethar­gic dis­play at St Mary’s.</p>
    <p>Carlo Ancelotti’s side fell be­hind in the 27th minute. Ward-Prowse passed into Danny Ings, be­fore re­ceiv­ing a re­turn ball, tak­ing one touch and fir­ing into the far cor­ner for his first goal of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>Adams dou­bled Southamp­ton’s lead eight min­utes later when Ings ghosted past Ben God­frey and Yerry Mina be­fore loft­ing a cross to his strike part­ner, whose shot de­flected off Gylfi Sig­urds­son on its way past goal­keeper Jor­dan Pick­ford.</p>
    <p>Ever­ton left-back Lu­cas Digne was sent off for a dan­ger­ous chal­lenge on Kyle Walker-Peters in the 72nd minute de­spite the French­man claim­ing to stamp on the Southamp­ton de­fender’s heel by ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Ever­ton man­ager Ancelotti told Sky Sports: “We didn’t play well, Southamp­ton were bet­ter than us and they de­served to win... The red card was a joke, it was not in­ten­tional, for sure it was not vi­o­lent.”</p>
    <p>With­out the sus­pended Richarli­son and in­jured Seamus Cole­man af­ter a stormy Mersey­side derby last week­end, Ever­ton lacked the drive that had been the hall­mark of their strong start to the sea­son.</p>
    <p>The vis­i­tors were marginally bet­ter in the sec­ond half, but James Ro­driguez was not hav­ing his usual in­flu­ence on Ever­ton’s play and their at­tack­ing threat was neutered.</p>
    <p>Southamp­ton also lim­ited the league’s joint-top scorer (along­side Son He­ung-min) Do­minic CalvertLew­in, who scored in all five pre­vi­ous league games, to zero shots and chances cre­ated. The in-form Eng­land striker had just 18 touches and com­pleted just five passes in 90 min­utes. Ever­ton did not reg­is­ter a sin­gle shot in the fi­nal 32 min­utes.</p>
    <p>They re­main above cham­pi­ons Liver­pool on goal dif­fer­ence af­ter a de­feat that could serve as a re­al­ity check.</p>
    <p>Southamp­ton have now lost just twice in 13 league matches and climbed within three points of Ever­ton in first place – a show of their progress un­der Ralph Hasen­huttl since they lost to Le­ices­ter 9-0 ex­actly a year ago.</p>
    <p>Hasen­huttl told BBC Sport: “My team did a fan­tas­tic job to­day, from the first mo­ment you could feel that the plan was work­ing and the guys were stick­ing to it. It was one of the best first halves so far for us.</p>
    <p>“I was al­ways con­vinced that Che Adams’ time would come. Some­times it takes a long time to adapt to this level but he was al­ways learn­ing and work­ing hard and he gets what he de­serves now.”</p>
    <p>The re­sult also means that this sea­son is the first top-flight cam­paign since 1967-68 in which ev­ery side have lost at least one of their first six matches. Four points sep­a­rate the top 10 in the fledg­ling ta­ble.</p>
