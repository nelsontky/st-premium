    <p>MAMA MI­NAJ: In a lov­ing trib­ute, rap­per Nicki Mi­naj showed off baby pho­tos of her three-month old son (right) for the first time.</p>
    <p>In an In­sta­gram post last Satur­day, the 38-year-old put up a se­ries of pho­tos show­ing her bun­dle of joy decked out in out­fits from de­sign­ers such as Fendi, Versace and Burberry.</p>
    <p>This is Mi­naj’s first child with hus­band Kenneth Petty, whom she mar­ried in 2019. Pre­vi­ously, all she had re­vealed of the baby was a photo of his tiny foot.</p>
    <p>The baby’s name is still un­known. Mi­naj had wanted to name him Ninja, but “changed it at the last minute”. In­stead, she calls him by his nick­name of Papa Bear.</p>
    <p>In the post, she wrote: “#Pa­paBear thank you so very much for choos­ing me to be your mama.” She also called him “Best of 2020”.</p>
    <p>In a ques­tion-and-an­swer ses­sion with fans last week, Mi­naj said she was in labour “all night” and had a vagi­nal birth with an epidu­ral on Sept 30 last year.</p>
    <p>The rap­per said: “I pushed for 2½ hours... be­cause, first, the epidu­ral didn’t wear off enough for me to feel my­self push­ing. Once I was able to feel the pain, I pushed him on out.”</p>
    <p>In her heart­felt In­sta­gram post, she added: “Be­com­ing a mum is by far the most ful­fill­ing job I’ve ever taken on. Send­ing love to all the su­per­hero moth­ers out there.</p>
    <p>Big hugs to all the women who have been preg­nant dur­ing this chal­leng­ing time.”</p>
