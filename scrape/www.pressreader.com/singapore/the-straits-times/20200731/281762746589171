    <p>TOKYO • Ja­pan is brac­ing it­self for a surge in the num­ber of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions after new daily cases ex­ceeded 1,000 for the first time, a week after the start of a na­tional travel cam­paign to re­vive the tourism in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The coun­try had 1,264 new cases on Wednes­day, ac­cord­ing to a tally by na­tional broad­caster NHK, sur­pass­ing the pre­vi­ous record of 981, with in­fec­tions spread­ing rapidly not only in Tokyo, but also in other re­gions, in­clud­ing re­mote is­lands.</p>
    <p>North­ern Ja­pan’s Iwate pre­fec­ture, which had been the last-re­main­ing pre­fec­ture free from coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion, had its first cases on Wednes­day, while the south­ern is­land of Ok­i­nawa had 44 in­fec­tions, hit­ting a record for the third day in a row.</p>
    <p>The na­tional travel cam­paign that Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe launched last week to re­vive a bat­tered tourism in­dus­try was crit­i­cised as ill-timed by a mem­ber of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s in­fluenza panel.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor No­rio Su­gaya said: “I’m all for sup­port­ing the tourism in­dus­try... But we should not do that when in­fec­tion is resur­gent. The virus spreads as peo­ple move. This is clearly a mis­take,”</p>
    <p>The dire sit­u­a­tion in Tokyo has prompted the city to ask its restau­rants, bars and karaoke par­lours to shut ear­lier as Gov­er­nor Yuriko Koike con­sid­ers declar­ing a state of emer­gency if the spread wors­ens. “The cur­rent sit­u­a­tion is more se­ri­ous than be­fore,” she said. “Tokyo will have to de­clare a state of emer­gency if the sit­u­a­tion gets worse.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Ja­pan’s For­eign Min­istry said the coun­try is lift­ing a ban on the re-en­try of some for­eign res­i­dents next week.</p>
    <p>From next Wednes­day, some 90,000 for­eign na­tion­als with res­i­dence per­mits, in­clud­ing stu­dents, busi­ness peo­ple and trainees, who left Ja­pan be­fore their des­ti­na­tion coun­tries were added to the ban list, can ap­ply to re­turn.</p>
    <p>They will have to ob­tain a “re-en­try con­fir­ma­tion let­ter” from the near­est Ja­panese diplo­matic mis­sion and sub­mit ev­i­dence of a neg­a­tive virus test con­ducted within 72 hours of their flight.</p>
    <p>From Sept 1, those con­di­tions will also ap­ply to for­eign na­tion­als in other cat­e­gories, in­clud­ing the spouses and chil­dren of the res­i­dents.</p>
