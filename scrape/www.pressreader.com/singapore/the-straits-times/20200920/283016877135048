    <p>As­set man­age­ment ex­ec­u­tive Wendy Lim is well aware that try­ing to time the mar­ket in this volatile en­vi­ron­ment is a fool’s er­rand, but she be­lieves it is im­por­tant to stay in­vested.</p>
    <p>“Many re­tail in­vestors fall into the trap of buy­ing high be­cause every­one is buy­ing, and sell­ing low as peo­ple panic and are ex­it­ing the mar­ket,” she notes.</p>
    <p>In­stead of try­ing to time the mar­ket, it is more im­por­tant for in­vestors to re­visit their fi­nan­cial ob­jec­tives and ad­just their in­vest­ments ac­cord­ingly, says Ms Lim, the 50-year-old chief ex­ec­u­tive of Man­ulife In­vest­ment Man­age­ment Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>She is also the re­gional head of the high-net-worth seg­ment for Asia at in­surer Man­ulife’s as­set man­age­ment arm.</p>
    <p>One of her strate­gies in re­cent years has been to scale back on risk-tak­ing in­vest­ments in favour of seek­ing i ncome and cap­i­tal preser­va­tion rather than growth.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim, who is mar­ried with a 16-year-old daugh­ter liv­ing in the United States, has close to three decades of ex­pe­ri­ence in the fi­nan­cial services in­dus­try, work­ing in po­si­tions from re­tail bank­ing to wealth man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Her cur­rent role in­volves work­ing with Man­ulife and its dis­tri­bu­tion part­ners to de­velop in­vest­ment and re­tire­ment so­lu­tions across the mu­tual fund, pen­sion and in­vest­ment-linked in­surance plat­forms for high-net-worth and re­tail clients, as well as as­set man­age­ment so­lu­tions for in­sti­tu­tional clients.</p>
    <p>Her ad­vice? It is never too early to start plan­ning for re­tire­ment: “In­vest ac­cord­ing to your risk ap­petite and never fo­cus on just the high head­line rate, as higher re­turns come with higher risks.</p>
    <p>“What is too good to be true is gen­er­ally so, and do not in­vest in any­thing that you do not fully un­der­stand.”</p>
    <p>Q What’s in your per­sonal port­fo­lio? A My per­sonal in­vest­ments con­sist of bonds, a few stocks, mu­tual funds /unit trusts in­vest­ing in fixed in­come, eq­ui­ties and multi-as­sets, and real es­tate. The largest al­lo­ca­tion is in real es­tate as prop­erty prices in Sin­ga­pore are high.</p>
    <p>Ex­clud­ing the real es­tate in­vest­ments, 50 per cent is in bonds and bond funds, 25 per cent in cash and cash-equiv­a­lents and the rest in stocks and eq­ui­ties funds.</p>
    <p>In­vest­ing in prop­erty pro­vides a nat­u­ral hedge against in­fla­tion and my non-real es­tate in­vest­ments are largely in in­come-gen­er­at­ing in­vest­ments, like the in­come funds man­aged by Man­ulife that pro­vide quar­terly pay­outs.</p>
    <p>My tar­geted an­nual re­turn for my per­sonal in­vest­ments is 5 per cent.</p>
    <p>Q What are your im­me­di­ate in­vest­ment plans?</p>
    <p>A My hus­band and I are tak­ing ac­tion to crys­tallise our evolv­ing re­tire­ment plans.</p>
    <p>We pur­chased a house in Or­lando, Florida, in May, which is right across the street from a golf club. We have spent quite a few sum­mers in Or­lando and have al­ways en­joyed our time there. It is a po­ten­tial re­tire­ment des­ti­na­tion as my hus­band is a US ci­ti­zen and Or­lando has plenty of golf cour­ses. The prop­erty mar­ket in Or­lando is soft and this prop­erty with its good lo­ca­tion be­came avail­able re­cently.</p>
    <p>We have an­other prop­erty in Dubai. My in-laws live in Dubai and this in­flu­enced our prop­erty pur­chase de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Q How did you get in­ter­ested in in­vest­ing?</p>
    <p>A My in­ter­est started when I was at Citibank and was part of the pi­o­neer­ing team that pro­moted wealth man­age­ment services in Sin­ga­pore in the late 1990s.</p>
    <p>Q De­scribe your in­vest­ment strat­egy.</p>
    <p>A My in­vest­ment ob­jec­tive has been to achieve fi­nan­cial se­cu­rity. It is about plan­ning for to­mor­row, today. My great­est fi­nan­cial achieve­ment is be­ing loan-free. Also, what is of­ten over­looked is strate­gic re-al­lo­ca­tion, which is key to meet­ing one’s evolv­ing fi­nan­cial goals over time. In re­cent years, I have di­alled back my risk-tak­ing</p>
    <p>and re-ori­ented my non-real es­tate in­vest­ments more into bonds and in­come funds.</p>
    <p>Q What else is in your fi­nan­cial plan?</p>
    <p>A I have put in place my will and lasting power of at­tor­ney. I also have life in­surance plans that were pur­chased when I was in my 20s.</p>
    <p>What my hus­band and I are con­sid­er­ing is a global med­i­cal plan that will serve our needs dur­ing our re­tire­ment years.</p>
    <p>Q How are you plan­ning for re­tire­ment?</p>
    <p>A When I started my ca­reer, I envi</p>
    <p>sioned re­tir­ing when I was 50. Now that I have reached this age, my tar­geted re­tire­ment is when I no longer feel that I can con­trib­ute to the fi­nan­cial services in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>But I can­not re­ally see my­self not work­ing even in re­tire­ment. I will likely be try­ing to con­trib­ute to the com­mu­nity in some way.</p>
    <p>My plans for my re­tire­ment fund is to gen­er­ate suf­fi­cient pas­sive in­come from my in­vest­ments that will fund my hus­band’s and my loan-free life­style.</p>
    <p>Q</p>
    <p>Money­wise, what were your growing-up years like?</p>
    <p>A Be­ing in­de­pen­dent was the big­gest life les­son that my par­ents in­stilled in my younger sis­ter and me, and we were given weekly pocket money from a young age to man­age and bud­get.</p>
    <p>When I was 15 years old, I took up a part-time role as an as­sis­tant bal­let in­struc­tor on the week­ends to earn ex­tra pocket money.</p>
    <p>My fa­ther has passed on and my mother has al­ways re­minded me to en­joy life and travel while I am young, rather than wait till I am re­tired as trav­el­ling can be a phys­i­cal chal­lenge then.</p>
    <p>Q What does money mean to you?</p>
    <p>A When I was younger, money was a yard­stick for suc­cess. Now, it’s about fi­nan­cial se­cu­rity and hav­ing the free­dom to live life.</p>
    <p>Q Home is now ...</p>
    <p>A A mod­est, free­hold three-bed­room apart­ment in River Val­ley.</p>
    <p>Q I drive ...</p>
    <p>A A red Porsche Boxster, although I would love to have a Jeep too!</p>
