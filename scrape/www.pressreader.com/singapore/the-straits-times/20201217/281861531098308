    <p>BANGKOK • When So­rawut Kit­tiban­thorn was look­ing for new types of waste to re­cy­cle, the then Lon­don-based stu­dent was drawn to the mil­lions of tonnes of chicken feath­ers be­ing dis­carded each year.</p>
    <p>Now back in his home­land of Thai­land, the 30-year-old is seek­ing fund­ing to con­tinue his re­search into how best to con­vert the nu­tri­ent com­po­nent found in the feath­ers into a pow­der that can be trans­formed into a lean, pro­tein­rich source of ed­i­ble food.</p>
    <p>“Chicken feather con­tains pro­tein and if we are able to serve this pro­tein to oth­ers in the world, the de­mand from ev­ery­one... will help re­duce waste,” said Mr So­rawut.</p>
    <p>The po­ten­tial ap­pears huge, given that he reck­ons about 2.3 mil­lion tonnes of feath­ers are dumped in Europe alone each year.</p>
    <p>And with gen­er­ally higher poul­try con­sump­tion in Asia, he be­lieves there could be up to 30 per cent more feather waste that could be ex­ploited in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Mr So­rawut, who stud­ied for a mas­ter’s de­gree in ma­te­rial fu­tures in Lon­don, said the idea still needs to go through other re­search and devel­op­ment phases. But pro­to­types in­clud­ing his take on chicken nuggets and a steak sub­sti­tute have re­ceived pos­i­tive re­views.</p>
    <p>“You know the tex­ture is very com­plex and ad­vanced. It’s some­thing you wouldn’t imag­ine that chicken feath­ers will be able to im­pro­vise into this kind of dish,” said food blog­ger Chol­rapee Asv­in­vi­chit, af­ter tuck­ing into “steak” served with gravy, mashed pota­toes and a salad.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally could imag­ine this (be­ing served) to me in some Miche­lin star (restau­rant).”</p>
    <p>Food sciences pro­fes­sor Hathairat Rim­keeree at Kaset­sart</p>
    <p>Univer­sity said: “I think it does have the po­ten­tial to be­come an al­ter­na­tive food source in fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>Plant-based sub­sti­tutes for meat have been gain­ing pop­u­lar­ity as more peo­ple shift to­wards ve­gan or vege­tar­ian di­ets, amid grow­ing con­cerns about health risks from eat­ing meat, an­i­mal welfare and the en­vi­ron­men­tal haz­ards of in­ten­sive an­i­mal farm­ing.</p>
    <p>While feather-based foods can­not be cat­e­gorised as ve­gan or vege­tar­ian, Mr So­rawut feels they should be con­sid­ered as eth­i­cal din­ing. “I plan to ap­proach the ze­rowaste restau­rants first be­cause even though these dishes are made from poul­try waste, it is still a byprod­uct from an­i­mals (we nor­mally con­sume).”</p>
