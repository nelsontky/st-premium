    <p>BEI­JING • China yes­ter­day said US Health Sec­re­tary Alex Azar has per­formed the “worst in the world” in con­trol­ling the coro­n­avirus, re­ject­ing crit­i­cism of Bei­jing made by Mr Azar dur­ing a three-day visit to Tai­wan this week.</p>
    <p>Mr Azar on Tues­day at­tacked China’s re­sponse to the Covid-19 pan­demic, say­ing that if such an out­break had emerged in Tai­wan or the United States, it could have been “snuffed out eas­ily”.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian told a reg­u­lar brief­ing in Bei­jing that the epi­demic in the US was “out of con­trol” and the blame lay with Mr Azar. “He i gnored mil­lions of Amer­i­cans suf­fer­ing f rom the virus and went to Tai­wan to put on a po­lit­i­cal show,” Mr Zhao said.</p>
    <p>“His be­hav­iour proves once again that in the eyes of US politi­cians, Amer­i­can lives mean noth­ing when com­pared with their self­ish po­lit­i­cal gains,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Azar was the high­est-level US of­fi­cial to visit Tai­wan in four decades and it came af­ter a sharp de­te­ri­o­ra­tion of re­la­tions be­tween the US and China over a range of is­sues in­clud­ing trade, Hong Kong and the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has re­peat­edly crit­i­cised China for try­ing to cover up the out­break, first iden­ti­fied in the Chi­nese city of Wuhan late last year, and pre­var­i­cat­ing on in­for­ma­tion shar­ing. China de­nies the ac­cu­sa­tions. The US has the high­est num­ber of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions and deaths in the world – 5.3 mil­lion cases and 167,761 deaths as of yes­ter­day – and Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has come un­der scathing at­tack from crit­ics at home for not tak­ing what he calls the “China virus” se­ri­ously enough.</p>
    <p>China has re­ported 84,737 con­firmed cases with 4,634 deaths.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan has been praised by health ex­perts for its early and ef­fec­tive steps to con­trol the out­break, with only 480 in­fec­tions and seven deaths.</p>
    <p>China con­sid­ers Tai­wan a break­away prov­ince and has vowed to bring it un­der its rule, by force if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhao said yes­ter­day at the brief­ing that China op­posed any of­fi­cial US ties with Tai­wan un­der any pre­text, adding that those who play with fire will get burnt.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing had ear­lier called for Mr Azar’s trip to be can­celled and Tai­wan ac­cused China of send­ing fighter jets over a de­facto bor­der on Mon­day, the day Mr Azar met Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Azar vis­ited a memo­rial to Tai­wan’s late pres­i­dent Lee Teng-hui, prais­ing his role in steer­ing the is­land’s tran­si­tion to democ­racy.</p>
    <p>Both Wash­ing­ton and Taipei had por­trayed Mr Azar’s trip as an op­por­tu­nity to learn from the suc­cess of Tai­wan’s battle against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>But the visit has also been an op­por­tu­nity to ruf­fle Bei­jing’s feath­ers at a time when Mr Trump is tak­ing an in­creas­ingly hard line against China as he seeks re-elec­tion in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to sup­port Tai­wan as our friend and our part­ner across se­cu­rity, eco­nomic and health­care is­sues,” Mr Azar told re­porters af­ter a visit to a mask fac­tory yes­ter­day, shortly be­fore fly­ing back to the US.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, he also hit out at Bei­jing for keep­ing Tai­wan locked out of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
