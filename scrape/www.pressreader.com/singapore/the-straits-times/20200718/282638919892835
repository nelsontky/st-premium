    <p>I have been grow­ing kangkong in pots in my bal­cony. They get six to eight hours of sun­light and the area is fairly windy. They have been grow­ing well and flow­er­ing. I har­vested some for cook­ing and the plant pro­duced new shoots just be­low where I had cut them. Re­cently, the plant showed brown patches (right). Is it still safe to eat? Is there a treat­ment for the is­sue?</p>
    <p>It ap­pears that your kangkong plant is in­fested with spi­der mites, which are minute sap-suck­ing pests. They look like small, red dots on af­fected leaves.</p>
    <p>These pests are at­tracted to plants that are un­der stress, such as when plants are grown in a dry and windy site.</p>
    <p>You can help to im­prove the plant’s health by grow­ing it in a more suit­able lo­ca­tion where it is more hu­mid and less windy. A strong plant is be­lieved to be able to ward off pest at­tacks bet­ter.</p>
    <p>Spi­der mites can be con­trolled by reg­u­lar ap­pli­ca­tions of neem oil, sum­mer oil or a ma­trine-based or­ganic pes­ti­cide which you can pur­chase via on­line shop­ping plat­forms. Re­peated ap­pli­ca­tions that cover all parts of the plant are needed to keep the pest in­fes­ta­tion low.</p>
    <p>The plant is still safe for con­sump­tion.</p>
