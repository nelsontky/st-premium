    <p>The Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Air Force’s (RSAF) next-gen­er­a­tion Aster 30 mis­sile sys­tem that is de­signed to neu­tralise air threats at longer ranges has been con­duct­ing round-the-clock op­er­a­tions since Au­gust.</p>
    <p>The ground-based sys­tem has also been in­te­grated into the RSAF’s net­worked Is­land Air De­fence Sys­tem, which can now counter a range of threats from fighter jets to un­manned aerial ve­hi­cles to pre­ci­sion-guided mu­ni­tions.</p>
    <p>De­fence Min­is­ter Ng Eng Hen said the air de­fence sys­tem’s cur­rent ca­pa­bil­i­ties marked a sig­nif­i­cant mile­stone since it was first de­vel­oped about 15 years ago.</p>
    <p>The trans­for­ma­tion is on a num­ber of fronts, said Dr Ng, af­ter wit­ness­ing an Aster 30 de­ploy­ment drill at Lim Chu Kang Camp II yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The air de­fence sys­tem can now see and re­spond to tar­gets much far­ther away while re­quir­ing far less man­power, be it in de­tect­ing threats or load­ing am­mu­ni­tion.</p>
    <p>An­other sig­nif­i­cant im­prove­ment is that it can deal with dif­fer­ent types of air threats, not just air­craft as in the past.</p>
    <p>“So I would say it’s a sig­nif­i­cant phase change that gives com­fort that we can pro­tect Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore­ans from threats from the air,” said Dr Ng, adding that the air de­fence sys­tem’s cur­rent ca­pa­bil­i­ties will serve Sin­ga­pore for at least the next two decades.</p>
    <p>The air de­fence sys­tem – con­cep­tu­alised around 2006 – in­te­grates ad­vanced sen­sors, such as the Multi-Mis­sion Radar and the Gulfstream 550 Air­borne Early Warn­ing air­craft and weapon sys­tems in­clud­ing the Aster 30 and short­er­range Spy­der mis­sile sys­tem.</p>
    <p>To­gether with the smart Com­bat Man­age­ment Sys­tem, the air de­fence sys­tem jointly de­vel­oped by</p>
    <p>the RSAF and the De­fence Sci­ence and Tech­nol­ogy Agency (DSTA) pro­vides a real-time pic­ture of the air sit­u­a­tion by or­gan­is­ing and com­bin­ing data from mul­ti­ple sources.</p>
    <p>The Com­bat Man­age­ment Sys­tem – the “brains” of the net­work – can au­to­mat­i­cally clas­sify threats and rec­om­mend the most ef­fec­tive weapon sys­tem to deal with them, us­ing ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and data an­a­lyt­ics.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, op­er­a­tors had to man­u­ally as­sess the threat each tar­get posed and as­sign the suit­able weapon sys­tem to take it down.</p>
    <p>Air De­fence Group Com­man­der Loh Woon Liang said the air de­fence sys­tem al­lows timely de­tec­tion of all kinds of air threats, from un­known air­craft to air-launched mu­ni­tions to un­manned aerial ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>The newly ac­quired Aster 30 in­creases its ef­fec­tive­ness, he said, not­ing: “Its range goes up to 70km, which al­lows de­fend­ers a greater re­sponse time to deal with a wide range of threats.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore first took de­liv­ery of the French-made Aster 30 in 2018 to re­place the i-Hawk that had been used for more than 30 years.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 11 peo­ple are needed to op­er­ate the i-Hawk, com­pared with six for the Aster 30.</p>
    <p>DSTA se­nior pro­gramme man­ager Teng Siang Loong said the Com­bat Man­age­ment Sys­tem was de­signed and built with the flex­i­bil­ity to in­te­grate dif­fer­ent sen­sors and weapon sys­tems, in­clud­ing fu­ture ones. The net­work also al­lows all the dif­fer­ent as­sets to op­er­ate to­gether as a cen­tralised pool of re­sources. “This en­hances the re­silience and sus­tain­abil­ity of crit­i­cal 24/7 air de­fence op­er­a­tions.”</p>
    <p>PRO­TEC­TION FROM THREATS</p>
    <p>I would say it’s a sig­nif­i­cant phase change that gives com­fort that we can pro­tect Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore­ans from threats from the air.</p>
