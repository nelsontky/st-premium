    <p>“We are send­ing a clear mes­sage to­day: The Indo-Pa­cific re­gion is a pri­or­ity of Ger­man for­eign pol­icy,” de­clared For­eign Min­is­ter Heiko Maas ear­lier this month as he an­nounced Ger­many’s first com­pre­hen­sive pol­icy guide­lines for this part of the world.</p>
    <p>Many have asked: Why is Ger­many com­ing out with such a frame­work? Fur­ther­more, how will it af­fect Ger­many’s in­ter­ac­tions with coun­tries in the Indo-Pa­cific?</p>
    <p>To the first ques­tion, as Mr Maas ex­plained in out­lin­ing Ger­many’s strate­gic in­ter­ests, Ger­man pros­per­ity and geopo­lit­i­cal in­flu­ence in the com­ing decades will de­pend on how it works to­gether with the coun­tries of the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion.</p>
    <p>“Here, more than any­where else, is where the shape of the in­ter­na­tional rules-based or­der of to­mor­row will be de­cided. We want to help shape that or­der – so that it is based on rules and in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion, not on the law of the strong.”</p>
    <p>In pur­suit of that goal, Ger­many will work to­wards strength­en­ing the idea of a mul­ti­po­lar world in which no coun­try has to de­cide be­tween poles of power.</p>
    <p>By work­ing more rig­or­ously with var­i­ous coun­tries of this re­gion, Ger­many will con­tinue to di­ver­sify its re­la­tions to avoid uni­lat­eral de­pen­den­cies.</p>
    <p>The se­cu­rity pol­icy sec­tor plays a spe­cial role in this con­text, but Ger­many sees the scope of co­op­er­a­tion ex­tend­ing to other ar­eas, such as the rule of law, hu­man rights and cul­tural, ed­u­ca­tional and sci­en­tific ex­changes. Dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion, tech­nolo­gies of the fu­ture as well as so­cial dis­course on free ac­cess to in­for­ma­tion and pro­tec­tion against mis­in­for­ma­tion are also ar­eas with po­ten­tial for greater en­gage­ment.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to launch this for­eign pol­icy ini­tia­tive is timely as Ger­many cur­rently holds the pres­i­dency of the Coun­cil of the Euro­pean Union and seeks to pro­mote a Euro­pean Indo-Pa­cific strat­egy.</p>
    <p>Ger­many’s new guide­lines on the Indo-Pa­cific also open a new chap­ter of co­op­er­a­tion with Asean mem­ber states.</p>
    <p>Asean lies at the heart of a re­gion that is of grow­ing eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal im­por­tance. At the same time, the strate­gic com­pe­ti­tion is in­creas­ing.</p>
    <p>Ger­many’s Indo-Pa­cific pol­icy guide­lines have been largely in­spired by the Asean Out­look on the Indo-Pa­cific. We share the view that the re­gion is a space for in­clu­sive co­op­er­a­tion and en­gage­ment, not con­tain­ment. More­over, the new pol­icy frame­work comes at a time when Asean’s re­la­tions with both Ger­many and the EU are grow­ing ever closer.</p>
    <p>It is hoped that by the year end, the EU will be able to form a “strate­gic part­ner­ship” with Asean.</p>
    <p>Shift­ing geopo­lit­i­cal power struc­tures in the Indo-Pa­cific have a di­rect im­pact on Ger­many and the EU at large.</p>
    <p>Our economies are closely con­nected through global sup­ply chains. Ma­jor trad­ing routes pass through the In­dian Ocean, the South China Sea and the Pa­cific. If con­flicts in the re­gion arise, they would have im­me­di­ate reper­cus­sions for us in Europe and Ger­many.</p>
    <p>Open mar­kets and free trade are as cru­cial for Ger­many as they are for Sin­ga­pore. That im­por­tance can be seen in the ris­ing share of the broader re­gion, in­clu­sive of South and East Asia, in Ger­many’s trade bal­ance – it amounted to over 20 per cent of the na­tion’s to­tal trade in goods, or just un­der €420 bil­lion (S$675 bil­lion), last year.</p>
    <p>MUL­TI­LAT­ER­AL­ISM AND RULES-BASED OR­DER</p>
    <p>A key driv­ing prin­ci­ple in Ger­many’s Indo-Pa­cific guide­lines is the im­por­tance of mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism. We be­lieve that stronger po­lit­i­cal, eco­nomic and se­cu­rity pol­icy net­works lead to a re­duc­tion of uni­lat­eral de­pen­den­cies and pre­serve both sovereignt­y and our abil­ity to act – in short, a “free and ac­tive for­eign pol­icy”.</p>
    <p>Mul­ti­lat­eral agree­ments are also the most ef­fec­tive way to make progress in ar­eas as di­verse as en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion, rules-based trade, dis­ar­ma­ment, arms con­trol and non-pro­lif­er­a­tion, as well as the pro­tec­tion of hu­man rights.</p>
    <p>Ger­many is com­mit­ted to the fur­ther in­te­gra­tion of the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion into mul­ti­lat­eral or­gan­i­sa­tions and fora such as the Group of 20. In the com­ing years, Ger­many will also step up co­op­er­a­tion with Asean in­sti­tu­tions and strengthen the role of the EU as a part­ner of Asean in close co­op­er­a­tion with its EU part­ners.</p>
    <p>As a mat­ter of prin­ci­ple, Ger­many is com­mit­ted to safe­guard­ing the rules-based or­der in the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion. It sup­ports a sub­stan­tive and legally bind­ing Code of Con­duct be­tween China and the Asean mem­ber states for the South China Sea, based on the prin­ci­ples of the United Na­tions Con­ven­tion on the Law of the Sea.</p>
    <p>Ger­many also backs the mon­i­tor­ing of UN sanc­tions against North Korea and of­fers its assistance in the me­di­a­tion of re­gional con­flicts with hu­man­i­tar­ian im­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>To tackle the com­mon chal­lenge for the world’s cli­mate, Ger­many in­tends to step up its co­op­er­a­tion with part­ners in the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion in all as­pects of cli­mate pol­icy, from adap­ta­tion to cli­mate change and pro­tec­tion of bio­di­ver­sity, to pro­mot­ing re­new­able en­er­gies and en­ergy ef­fi­ciency. Given Sin­ga­pore’s role as a re­gional hub, Ger­many sees it as an es­sen­tial part­ner for newly launched ini­tia­tives in the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, we seek op­por­tu­ni­ties for co­op­er­a­tion in key tech­nolo­gies and ad­vo­cate their re­spon­si­ble use. An ex­panded cy­ber-se­cu­rity co­op­er­a­tion with Sin­ga­pore will deepen our di­a­logue with part­ners with shared val­ues.</p>
    <p>A Ger­man navy of­fi­cer has been sec­onded re­cently to the Sin­ga­pore-based In­for­ma­tion Fu­sion Cen­tre for bet­ter co­or­di­na­tion in mar­itime se­cu­rity and counter-piracy.</p>
    <p>We also aim to set up a re­gional Ger­man in­for­ma­tion cen­tre in Sin­ga­pore to help with the dis­sem­i­na­tion of ac­cu­rate in­for­ma­tion and fact-based nar­ra­tives.</p>
    <p>As for trade, Berlin places great im­por­tance on build­ing a net­work of free and com­pre­hen­sive trade agree­ments in ad­di­tion to a broader one be­tween the EU and Asean. The EU al­ready has a pi­o­neer­ing free trade agree­ment with Sin­ga­pore. The hope is to build on that re­gion­ally, elim­i­nat­ing trade and in­vest­ment bar­ri­ers while agree­ing on is­sues such as en­vi­ron­men­tal and so­cial stan­dards, cli­mate pro­tec­tion and com­pe­ti­tion pol­icy, sub­si­dies and the pro­tec­tion of in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty.</p>
    <p>The les­son of the Covid-19 pan­demic is that the world can­not af­ford to “de­glob­alise” its sup­ply chains and trade re­la­tions, but rather it should di­ver­sify them and make them more re­silient. The forg­ing of more trade agree­ments be­tween Ger­many and the EU and coun­tries of the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion will help con­trib­ute to­wards this goal.</p>
    <p>To sum up, Ger­many’s Indo-Pa­cific pol­icy re­flects the grow­ing im­por­tance of the re­gion to Ger­many and the EU.</p>
    <p>By set­ting out the for­eign pol­icy guide­lines, Ger­many is open­ing a new chap­ter in its re­la­tions with the re­gion and hopes, with Asean as its part­ner, to be able to con­trib­ute to a se­cure, sta­ble and pros­per­ous Indo-Pa­cific.</p>
