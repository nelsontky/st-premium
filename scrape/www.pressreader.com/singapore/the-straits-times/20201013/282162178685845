    <p>A group of ag­grieved In­dian star­tups are pool­ing their re­sources to take on what they con­sider to be Google’s dom­i­nance of the coun­try’s dig­i­tal ecosys­tem.</p>
    <p>Lead­ing the charge is Paytm, a pop­u­lar In­dian dig­i­tal wal­let, that launched an An­droid mini app store last week.</p>
    <p>Paytm also hosted a “Mini Apps De­vel­op­ers Con­fer­ence” on Thurs­day as it at­tempts to re­duce de­pen­dence on the Amer­i­can tech be­he­moth’s Play Store.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to one In­dian tech chief ex­ec­u­tive who has been part of these in­for­mal dis­cus­sions, this push­back could draw po­ten­tial sup­port from the gov­ern­ment as well as ju­di­cial in­ter­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>“There are all kinds of op­tions that we will try,” Mr Di­nesh Agar­wal, CEO of e-com­merce firm In­di­aMART, told The Straits Times. He cited di­rect down­loads from web­sites and app stores other than the Play Store as pos­si­ble strate­gies.</p>
    <p>“We will also try work­ing with the gov­ern­ment – telling them about pos­si­ble solutions as well as the po­ten­tial risks (of Google’s dom­i­nance) – and even ap­proach­ing the court, be­sides build­ing al­liances with sim­i­lar dis­sent­ing voices in other parts of the world,” he added.</p>
    <p>Last week, top rep­re­sen­ta­tives from around 15 tech firms held a vir­tual meet­ing with the Com­pe­ti­tion Com­mis­sion of In­dia to dis­cuss their con­cerns.</p>
    <p>Google has al­ready been forced to take note of grow­ing crit­i­cism of its poli­cies in In­dia. On Oct 5, the firm is­sued a state­ment that it re­mains “deeply com­mit­ted to the suc­cess of the In­dian ecosys­tem” and promised to set up “lis­ten­ing ses­sions with In­dian start-ups to un­der­stand their con­cerns more deeply”.</p>
    <p>It also of­fered In­dian play­ers a more re­laxed time­line un­til March 31, 2022, to in­te­grate them­selves with a new Play Store billing pol­icy, thereby de­fer­ring a con­tro­ver­sial move to charge a 30 per cent com­mis­sion on in-app pur­chases. In other parts of the world, the new pol­icy will take ef­fect by Septem­ber next year.</p>
    <p>Paytm founder Vi­jay Shekhar Sharma had tweeted on Oct 5: “When you take what we earn, you don’t grow to­gether. You grow at our cost.”</p>
    <p>There have been mur­murs against Google’s dom­i­nance among In­dian tech firms for some time now. Op­po­si­tion, how­ever, gained mo­men­tum af­ter Paytm found out last month that its app had been blocked out of Google’s Play Store for vi­o­lat­ing its pol­icy on sports bet­ting ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The now-aban­doned move to charge a 30 per cent com­mis­sion com­pounded frus­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Paytm had in­tro­duced a cam­paign on its app that al­lowed users to col­lect cricket stick­ers and scratch cards to earn cash­backs on the Uni­fied Pay­ments In­ter­face (UPI). The UPI is a real-time pay­ment sys­tem de­vel­oped by Na­tional Pay­ments Cor­po­ra­tion of In­dia to fa­cil­i­tate in­ter-bank trans­ac­tions. Paytm was forced to com­ply with Google’s man­date of re­mov­ing its UPI cash­back of­fer to get relisted on the Play Store.</p>
    <p>“Google and its em­ploy­ees are making poli­cies which are over and above the laws of our coun­try, and are ar­bi­trar­ily im­ple­ment­ing them,” Paytm had then said in a press state­ment.</p>
    <p>Echo­ing this con­cern that is shared by many in the In­dian tech ecosys­tem, Mr Agar­wal said: “On what ba­sis can a com­pany based in the US de­cide what is le­gal and il­le­gal in dif­fer­ent parts of the world? To­mor­row it could re­move an app of na­tional im­por­tance.”</p>
    <p>Google owns An­droid, the op­er­at­ing sys­tem on which more than 95 per cent of smart­phones in In­dia run.</p>
    <p>There have been grow­ing calls from the likes of Mr Agar­wal to en­sure the op­er­at­ing sys­tem re­mains a level play­ing field for apps that are down­loaded from sources other than the Play Store.</p>
    <p>Paytm has said its newly launched store will al­low de­vel­op­ers to list and dis­trib­ute their mini apps with­out any charges, be­sides help­ing “build a sus­tain­able and thriv­ing lo­cal tech­nol­ogy ecosys­tem”.</p>
    <p>A mini app is a cus­tom-built mo­bile web­site that gives users an ap­p­like ex­pe­ri­ence with­out hav­ing to down­load it. Paytm claims more than 300 app-based ser­vice providers such as De­cathalon and Ola have joined the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The Mini Apps De­vel­op­ers Con­fer­ence was also an at­tempt by Paytm to lend fur­ther heft to its cam­paign against Google, which some have de­scribed as im­pul­sive. It fea­tured a dis­cus­sion on the “future of the app ecosys­tem and why In­dia should con­trol its own des­tiny”.</p>
    <p>The firm also an­nounced a 100 mil­lion ru­pees (S$1.85 mil­lion) in­vest­ment fund for mini app de­vel­op­ers in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Pavel Naiya, a se­nior an­a­lyst with Coun­ter­point Re­search, said this push­back is sim­i­lar to an­titrust con­cerns that have been ex­pressed against Google in other parts of the world.</p>
    <p>But he told The Straits Times it would be a “mam­moth task” to take on the firm’s clout, cit­ing mo­bile op­er­at­ing sys­tems such as Sail­fish or the one from Mi­crosoft that failed to gain trac­tion.</p>
    <p>“But I also think Google will work to­wards a diplo­matic mid­dle path in the l ong run be­cause go­ing against the gov­ern­ment is not some­thing that any sen­si­ble busi­ness would like to do,” he added.</p>
    <p>But I also think Google will work to­wards a diplo­matic mid­dle path in the long run be­cause go­ing against the gov­ern­ment is not some­thing that any sen­si­ble busi­ness would like to do.</p>
