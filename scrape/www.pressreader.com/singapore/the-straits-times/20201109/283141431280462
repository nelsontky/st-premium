    <p>It has been al­most a year since Sin­ga­pore saw its first Covid-19 case in Jan­uary. Since then, there has been a sea change in how peo­ple work — though many have been told to work from home in­def­i­nitely, those who have been al­lowed to re­turn to work­places start­ing Septem­ber face a wave of new work­place mea­sures.</p>
    <p>For sure, the pan­demic has com­pletely re-writ­ten work­place safety and health (WSH) mea­sures, which are here to stay. Safe man­age­ment prac­tices at of­fices across the is­land re­main en­hanced, in­volv­ing Safe En­try signs-in for con­tact-trac­ing pur­poses, tem­per­a­ture-tak­ing and vis­ual re­minders to stay vig­i­lant.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in of­fices of a dif­fer­ent kind — con­struc­tion work­sites and ship­yard pro­duc­tion lines — there are ad­di­tional re­quire­ments to ful­fil, re­quir­ing spe­cific sec­tors such as con­struc­tion, engi­neer­ing and man­u­fac­tur­ing to over­haul their WSH prac­tices.</p>
    <p>Chal­lenges in man­ag­ing risks</p>
    <p>Mr Raja Ja­yara­man of Toyah Con­struc­tion & Engi­neer­ing says one chal­lenge faced was iden­ti­fy­ing dif­fer­ent risk lev­els for var­i­ous jobs at dif­fer­ent work­places, and com­ing up with rou­tines to suit those jobs.</p>
    <p>Notes the work­place safety and health man­ager: “Work­places for jobs at medium risk re­quire daily clean­ing and dis­in­fec­tion at least two times a day for ob­jects and sur­faces that are touched reg­u­larly, in­clud­ing all shared rooms, sur­faces, floors and bath­rooms.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany also had to con­sider sus­pend­ing any ac­tiv­ity where phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing of at least 1m could not be im­ple­mented in full, which could be a chal­lenge for cer­tain con­struc­tion or engi­neer­ing projects.</p>
    <p>In those cases, Mr Ja­yara­man says: “We had to in­crease ven­ti­la­tion, im­ple­ment en­hanced reg­u­lar hand hy­giene, and re­quire staff to wear ap­pro­pri­ate face masks, gog­gles, gloves and work clothes dur­ing clean­ing pro­ce­dures that gen­er­ate splashes.”</p>
    <p>New mea­sures and frame­works</p>
    <p>At phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal gi­ant Am­gen, the Covid-19 out­break was an op­por­tu­nity for it to “go above and beyond” in im­prov­ing its WSH stan­dards.</p>
    <p>Ms Emily Razaqi, vice-pres­i­dent of Am­gen</p>
    <p>Com­mu­ni­ca­tion was fa­cil­i­tated via mes­sag­ing apps, meet­ings were held on­line, and hands-free in­frared ther­mome­ters were placed on-site to avoid close con­tact among work­ers dur­ing tem­per­a­ture tak­ing.</p>
    <p>DAI WENBIN, Qingjian In­ter­na­tional (South Pa­cific) Group’s En­vi­ron­men­tal, Health and Safety Man­ager</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­u­fac­tur­ing, says: “With Covid-19 ar­riv­ing rel­a­tively early to Sin­ga­pore, we were able to de­velop a frame­work for safety man­age­ment that served as a roadmap which was ap­plied across all of our sites glob­ally. This helped not only our Sin­ga­pore site, but Am­gen’s en­tire global net­work to con­tinue with sup­plies to our pa­tients while en­sur­ing the safety of our staff around the world.”</p>
    <p>Ms Razaqi adds that it was a chal­lenge “to quickly en­able staff to nav­i­gate and as­sim­i­late to a host of new safety pro­to­cols and main­tain phys­i­cal dis­tance with­out com­pro­mis­ing so­cial con­nec­tion at a scale that was not needed be­fore”.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes in­te­grat­ing em­ploy­ees’ daily tem­per­a­ture record­ing, Safe En­try data log and travel dec­la­ra­tions un­der one seam­less web/ mo­bile app plat­form, which helped the com­pany mon­i­tor any de­vi­a­tions and to com­ply with Sin­ga­pore’s guide­lines.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing a dig­i­tal ap­proach</p>
    <p>She also notes a key part of Am­gen Sin­ga­pore’s In­dus­try 4.0 strat­egy is to build a ro­bust dig­i­tal in­fra­struc­ture to en­able op­ti­mal and real-time use of big data for an­a­lyt­ics and other ap­pli­ca­tions, which in­cludes im­prov­ing the safety and qual­ity out­comes of its WSH pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion also played a ma­jor role in en­hanc­ing WSH mea­sures for con­struc­tion com­pany Qingjian In­ter­na­tional (South Pa­cific) Group. Be­fore the pan­demic struck in</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, the com­pany pre­ferred phys­i­cal meet­ings to com­mu­ni­cate and solve prob­lems face-to-face. The cir­cuit breaker pe­riod was “a game changer”, says its EHS (en­vi­ron­men­tal health & safety) man­ager Dai Wenbin.</p>
    <p>He says: “We had to adopt safe man­age­ment mea­sures, which all re­quired planned and writ­ten pro­ce­dures. The fo­cus was to pro­tect work­ers from Covid-19, and two ques­tions were on our minds — How can we restart work safely, and how can we con­trol the spread of Covid-19 on the work­site?”</p>
    <p>Com­mu­ni­ca­tion was fa­cil­i­tated via mes­sag­ing apps, meet­ings were held on­line, and hands-free in­frared ther­mome­ters were placed on-site to avoid close con­tact among work­ers dur­ing tem­per­a­ture tak­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Dai adds: “It was not some­thing we could adapt to overnight, a lot of trial ses­sions were in­volved. We are now look­ing into dig­i­tal­is­ing our Per­mit to Work Sys­tem (e-per­mit sys­tem) to re­duce con­tact points, and be­come a greener or­gan­i­sa­tion.”</p>
    <p>Qingjian es­ti­mates that costs re­gard­ing en­hanc­ing WSH mea­sures for mixed devel­op­ment Le Quest would rise about 50 per cent, but “but even if we are look­ing at a higher per­cent­age, we will in­vest, as work­ers are our great­est as­set. Projects will not be com­pleted well with­out ev­ery­one’s sup­port”.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Hwa Seng Builder (HSB) saw a 30 per cent in­crease in ex­penses for its en­hanced WSH mea­sures. Then again, it has been in­vest­ing heav­ily in the safety and well-be­ing of its work­force over time.</p>
    <p>Says its man­ag­ing direc­tor Thomas Ng: “In 2014, we cre­ated our Cor­po­rate Safety Depart­ment with ded­i­cated qual­i­fied train­ers and safety as­ses­sors. A year later, we set up a ded­i­cated train­ing cen­tre fea­tur­ing an in­for­ma­tive gallery, and a VR train­ing room with ev­ery­day ac­tiv­i­ties in­clud­ing traf­fic man­age­ment, among other things.”</p>
    <p>As part of its roadmap to move to­wards in­no­va­tion and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and im­prove pro­duc­tiv­ity on field pro­cesses and off-site man­age­ment, HSB has been us­ing the No­vade Man­age­ment Soft­ware for a few years now, col­lect­ing facts and statis­tics dur­ing its daily safety op­er­a­tions to make bet­ter data-driven de­ci­sions, he adds.</p>
    <p>All four or­gan­i­sa­tions also high­lighted the im­por­tance of im­prov­ing the men­tal health of em­ploy­ees — their great­est as­set.</p>
    <p>As Mr Ja­yara­man points out: “Men­tal health and psy­choso­cial sup­port should be made avail­able to all work­ers. Com­pre­hen­sive risk as­sess­ments can help iden­tify and mit­i­gate re­lated oc­cu­pa­tional haz­ards for men­tal health.”</p>
    <p>With Covid-19 ar­riv­ing rel­a­tively early to Sin­ga­pore, we were able to de­velop a frame­work for safety man­age­ment that served as a roadmap which was ap­plied across all of our sites glob­ally.</p>
