        - <span role="byline">JAMES RODRIGUEZ (EVER&#xAD;TON, COLOM&#xAD;BIA)</span>
    </section>

    <p>James won the Golden Boot award at the 2014 World Cup but his stock has fallen to such an ex­tent that he will try to reignite his ca­reer at Ever­ton, rather than a Cham­pi­ons League club.</p>
    <p>If any­one can get a tune out of the 29-year-old play­maker, it is Tof­fees boss Carlo Ancelotti, who first took him to Real Madrid and also signed him on loan at Bay­ern Mu­nich.</p>
    <p>Af­ter some of the ster­ile foot­ball served up by Ever­ton last sea­son, the £12 mil­lion (S$21.24 mil­lion) James link­ing up with fel­low new sign­ings Ab­doulaye Doucoure and Al­lan should at least give the fans some­thing to feel hope­ful about.</p>
    <p>FABIO SILVA (WOLVES, POR­TU­GAL)</p>
    <p>He turned 18 only in July yet Wolves paid a clu­brecord fee for the young at­tacker who has caught the eye of Europe’s elite.</p>
    <p>The £35 mil­lion fee might look a bit high for a player who has scored three goals in only 21 se­nior ap­pear­ances for Porto but in Nuno Espir­ito Santo, he has the ideal man­ager to flour­ish un­der.</p>
    <p>The Por­tu­gal Un­der-19 in­ter­na­tional, who should serve as com­pe­ti­tion for Mexico striker Raul Jimenez, has al­ready been touted as the “new Cris­tiano Ron­aldo”, and is said to be equally com­fort­able in the air as he is on his feet.</p>
    <p>OL­LIE WATKINS (AS­TON VILLA, ENG­LAND)</p>
    <p>Watkins is the most ex­pen­sive player ever signed from the Cham­pi­onship, and his record in the sec­ond tier is noth­ing to be sniffed at.</p>
    <p>He net­ted 26 goals to fin­ish as the com­pe­ti­tion’s joint-top scorer, help­ing Brent­ford to reach the play-off fi­nal last sea­son be­fore los­ing to pro­moted Ful­ham.</p>
    <p>The 24-year-old has never played in the top flight and while his £28 mil­lion trans­fer fee has raised eye­brows, the striker can prove the doubters wrong if he can steer Villa away from a rel­e­ga­tion bat­tle.</p>
