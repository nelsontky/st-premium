    <p>Malaysia’s Sabah state will face a snap elec­tion after its state as­sem­bly was dis­solved yes­ter­day, fol­low­ing at­tempts by a for­mer chief min­is­ter to form a new govern­ment after se­cur­ing sev­eral de­fec­tions. Chief Min­is­ter Shafie Ap­dal (below) an­nounced the state as­sem­bly’s dis­so­lu­tion, say­ing the state’s Gov­er­nor Juhar Mahirud­din has con­sented to the dis­so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>PEO­PLE’S MAN­DATE</p>
    <p>I met TYT (the gov­er­nor) last night to ex­press our in­ten­tion, and then we made prepa­ra­tions, so this morn­ing, I went to Is­tana around eight-some­thing, and he ap­proved this.</p>
    <p>I think it’s time for us to re­turn the man­date to Saba­hans.</p>

    <p>DATUK SERI SHAFIE AP­DAL, Sabah’s chief min­is­ter, on the move to dis­solve the state as­sem­bly.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s Sabah state will face a snap elec­tion after its state as­sem­bly was dis­solved yes­ter­day, fol­low­ing at­tempts by a for­mer chief min­is­ter to form a new govern­ment after se­cur­ing sev­eral de­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Chief Min­is­ter Shafie Ap­dal an­nounced the state as­sem­bly’s dis­so­lu­tion at a press con­fer­ence in Kota Kin­a­balu, say­ing the state’s Gov­er­nor Juhar Mahirud­din has con­sented to the dis­so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>“I met TYT (the gov­er­nor) last night to ex­press our in­ten­tion, and then we made prepa­ra­tions, so this morn­ing, I went to Is­tana around eight-some­thing, and he ap­proved this. I think it’s time for us to re­turn the man­date to Saba­hans,” Datuk Seri Shafie told re­porters yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>For­mer Sabah chief min­is­ter Musa Aman on Wednes­day met the press with 31 other state law­mak­ers, and in­di­cated he was ready to form a new govern­ment to re­place the one led by Mr Shafie’s Parti Warisan Sabah.</p>
    <p>An­other as­sem­bly­man de­fected yes­ter­day, mean­ing Tan Sri Musa has the min­i­mum 33 seats to form the ma­jor­ity in the 65-seat as­sem­bly.</p>
    <p>Warisan is backed by the Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) op­po­si­tion bloc, with Mr Shafie a staunch ally of for­mer premier Ma­hathir Mo­hamad.</p>
    <p>The elec­tion has to take place within 60 days of the dis­so­lu­tion. Mr Shafie will re­main the care­taker chief of the East Malaysian state un­til the polls take place.</p>
    <p>Only state as­sem­bly­men will be elected dur­ing the state elec­tion, with the 25 Sabah fed­eral MPs re­tain­ing their wards.</p>
    <p>The Sabah leg­is­la­ture has 60 elected law­mak­ers and five who are ap­pointed by the reign­ing state govern­ment. Un­til Mr Musa’s news con­fer­ence on Wednes­day, Mr Shafie’s coali­tion con­trolled 45 of the 65 seats, or more than two-thirds.</p>
    <p>The state polls will rep­re­sent the first ma­jor po­lit­i­cal bat­tle be­tween the five-month-old Perikatan Na­sional (PN) govern­ment and the PH-led op­po­si­tion bloc.</p>
    <p>The elec­tion in Sabah goes be­yond the fight be­tween two arch ri­vals – Mr Shafie, 63, and Mr Musa, 69.</p>
    <p>A vic­tory for PN could help Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin en­tice sev­eral Sabah MPs to his al­liance, thus se­cur­ing a more com­fort­able ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment, where he holds only a two-seat ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>The elec­tion will also be a lit­mus test for the fed­eral op­po­si­tion bloc, which re­mains split over its choice of a prime min­is­te­rial can­di­date.</p>
    <p>The three-party PH is led by Datuk Seri An­war Ibrahim. The rest of the op­po­si­tion MPs are lumped to­gether un­der the so-called PH Plus al­liance, con­sist­ing of MPs from Tun Dr Ma­hathir’s group and those from Warisan led by Mr Shafie.</p>
    <p>The co­op­er­a­tion and per­for­mance of the blocs led by Mr An­war and Dr Ma­hathir in Sabah will be a cru­cial pre­cur­sor for their work­ing re­la­tion­ship at the fed­eral level, with a na­tional snap gen­eral elec­tion ex­pected within the next few months.</p>
    <p>The PN al­liance led by Tan Sri Muhyid­din is now in con­trol of nine out of the 13 Malaysian states, after suc­cess­fully top­pling PH-led state leg­is­la­tures in Perak, Jo­hor, Me­laka and Kedah. Sabah is the first state to opt for a dis­so­lu­tion of the as­sem­bly, rather than al­low it­self to fall to PN by way of de­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>With Sabah’s dis­so­lu­tion, PH and its part­ners are now left with just three state ad­min­is­tra­tions in Se­lan­gor, Pe­nang and Negeri Sem­bi­lan.</p>
    <p>In the 2018 state as­sem­bly elec­tion, Mr Shafie’s Warisan, along with PH par­ties, won 29 out of the 60 seats con­tested in the state as­sem­bly. Barisan Na­sional (BN), led by Mr Musa, also won 29 seats, lead­ing to a hung as­sem­bly.</p>
    <p>But Mr Shafie man­aged to se­cure crossovers from sev­eral BN par­ties to form the state govern­ment.</p>
    <p>Sabah is home to 3.4 mil­lion peo­ple, just over 10 per cent of Malaysia’s pop­u­la­tion. Its eco­nomic out­put is the fifth-largest among Malaysia’s 13 states, but it is one of the coun­try’s poor­est states by gross do­mes­tic prod­uct per capita.</p>
