    <p>NEW YORK • Vi­a­com and CBS chair­man emer­i­tus Sum­ner Red­stone, the me­dia mogul who took his fa­ther’s movie the­atre chain and built it into an em­pire that in­cluded Para­mount Pic­tures, CBS and MTV, has died at 97, Vi­a­comCBS and Na­tional Amuse­ments said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Red­stone, as ex­ec­u­tive chair­man of both Vi­a­com and CBS, had con­trolled the t wo com­pa­nies through pri­vately held Na­tional Amuse­ments. But in his early 90s, the state of his phys­i­cal and men­tal health set off an avalanche of cor­po­rate ma­noeu­vring over his me­dia hold­ings that re­sulted in him step­ping down in 2016 as ex­ec­u­tive chair­man of both com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>CBS and Vi­a­com were com­bined from 2000 to 2006, when Mr Red­stone sep­a­rated them in an at­tempt to un­leash the value of Vi­a­com’s ca­ble chan­nels. His po­si­tion as one of the world’s tow­er­ing me­dia moguls had be­gun fad­ing in 2015 as those close to him be­gan ques­tion­ing his men­tal ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>The long-run­ning le­gal battle that en­sued put him at odds with a for­mer girl­friend and long-time con­fi­dante Philippe Dau­man but re</p>
    <p>Mr Sum­ner Red­stone was one of the me­dia ex­ec­u­tives who changed the world of news and entertainm­ent.</p>
    <p>united him with his daugh­ter, Shari, from whom he had been es­tranged.</p>
    <p>The chal­lenges to Mr Red­stone’s men­tal health saw him be­ing re­placed as CBS’ ex­ec­u­tive chair­man by Mr Les Moonves and at Vi­a­com by Mr Dau­man, whom Mr Red­stone would later drop from the trust that was to de­ter­mine the di­rec­tion of both com­pa­nies af­ter his death.</p>
    <p>Af­ter much le­gal and back­room wran­gling that one ob­server likened to Game Of Thrones, the Red­stone fam­ily ousted Mr Dau­man from Vi­a­com in Au­gust 2016, ul­ti­mately re­plac­ing him with Mr Robert Bak­ish.</p>
    <p>Mr Dau­man had been among those ques­tion­ing Mr Red­stone’s men­tal ca­pac­ity and his in­flu­ence had waned af­ter Mr Red­stone’s daugh­ter, Shari, started tak­ing a more ac­tive role in his busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Since 2016, Ms Shari has pushed twice to merge CBS and Vi­a­com. She has also weath­ered a law­suit aimed at di­lut­ing her fam­ily’s con­trol of CBS, and a sex­ual mis­con­duct scan­dal at CBS, which re­sulted in the Septem­ber 2018 res­ig­na­tion of Mr Moonves at CBS. Vi­a­com and CBS re-merged in 2019.</p>
    <p>Af­ter decades spent build­ing his em­pire, Mr Red­stone’s par­tic­i­pa­tion at cor­po­rate events be­came min­i­mal in 2014 and he spoke only a few words on earn­ings calls.</p>
    <p>Mr Red­stone’s death, which comes at a time when the me­dia land­scape is en­dur­ing wrench­ing changes, thins the ranks of a group of me­dia ex­ec­u­tives, in­clud­ing Mr Ru­pert Mur­doch and Mr Ted Turner, who changed the world of news and entertainm­ent with the com­pa­nies they built.</p>
