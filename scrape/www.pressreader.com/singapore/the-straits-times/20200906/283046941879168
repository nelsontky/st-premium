    <p>When ne­go­ti­at­ing a raise, tim­ing mat­ters. Typ­i­cally, it’s best to ask be­fore an­nual bud­gets are locked and to steer clear of Mon­day morn­ings when the boss may be cranky.</p>
    <p>But in a pan­demic-led re­ces­sion? It’s awk­ward, for sure, but it’s not an im­pos­si­ble task.</p>
    <p>With many peo­ple out of a job now, you may be grate­ful to just have a spot on your com­pany’s pay­roll.</p>
    <p>Ask­ing for a higher salary now can feel in­ap­pro­pri­ate or down­right greedy.</p>
    <p>But let’s re­mem­ber: You’re not the only one who should feel for­tu­nate. Your com­pany is ben­e­fit­ing from your con­tri­bu­tions and, with your sup­port, nav­i­gat­ing its way through a chal­leng­ing time. If you had a con­vinc­ing case for a raise back in Jan­uary, and you’ve con­tin­ued to over­pro­duce and work longer days, don’t give up.</p>
    <p>This could still be your year to make more.</p>
    <p>THE AP­PROACH</p>
    <p>Pre­pare to ask as you would in a “nor­mal” econ­omy, while be­ing hy­per-con­scious of the cur­rent en­vi­ron­ment with these steps.</p>
    <p>Quan­tify your most re­cent con­tri­bu­tions. If your per­for­mance was stel­lar at your com­pany last year, great. But how’s this year far­ing?</p>
    <p>In a pay rise dis­cus­sion, high­light­ing your mea­sur­able con­tri­bu­tions from the past year or two to prove your worth is stan­dard. But at a time when so many com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing yours, may be piv­ot­ing or chang­ing busi­ness mod­els, it’s more con­vinc­ing to point out re­cent ac­com­plish­ments.</p>
    <p>Fo­cus on the last four to six months and how your in­no­va­tion, flex­i­bil­ity and lead­er­ship have held up the com­pany and en­hanced the bot­tom line.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple: Cite the new ac­counts you landed this sum­mer that brought in tens of thou­sands of dol­lars or more, the soft­ware pro­gram you de­vel­oped in a pinch that led to im­me­di­ate cost sav­ings or the search en­gine op­ti­mi­sa­tion tweaks you im­ple­mented that drove more traf­fic and sales.</p>
    <p>PRO­POSE PAY “TRIG­GERS”</p>
    <p>If you sense hes­i­ta­tion from your em­ployer to bump up your pay now – de­spite your re­cent wins – sug­gest earn­ing in­cre­men­tally more if and when spe­cific goals are met from here on out, sort of like a com­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>“De­sign some trig­gers for in­creas­ing in­come,” sug­gests Ms Ge­or­gia Lee Hussey, who runs the firm Mod­ernist Fi­nan­cial. “If you met this stretch goal that would pro­duce this much rev­enue, maybe you could get a piece of it,” she says.</p>
    <p>In un­cer­tain times, em­ploy­ers may be more com­fort­able ty­ing com­pen­sa­tion to real rev­enue re­sults to limit risk. Plus, it cre­ates a clearer win-win sce­nario and demon­strates that proac­tive­ness on your part. “It makes it harder to say no,” she says.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, let’s say you run ad­mis­sions at a school and man­aged to in­crease on­line en­rol­ment this sum­mer. If your boss still re­sists rais­ing your pay, sug­gest that if you at­tract a cer­tain num­ber of stu­dents for the next term, you re­ceive a 15 per cent pay hike, which is just a frac­tion of the en­rol­ment rev­enue.</p>
    <p>MIND THE LAY­OFFS</p>
    <p>If your com­pany re­cently down­sized, fur­loughed or an­nounced a hir­ing freeze, hold off on salary dis­cus­sions for a bit. Wait at least a month or two to let the dust set­tle.</p>
    <p>Oth­er­wise your boss can eas­ily brush off your re­quest for a raise, even though you may well de­serve it. If your com­pany is still stand­ing months later and has since shown signs of growth by, say, mak­ing a new hire, ex­pand­ing a line of busi­ness or ac­quir­ing as­sets, your man­ager can’t sim­ply say there’s no room in the bud­get.</p>
    <p>In fact, for many com­pa­nies, June was a piv­otal time, with small and medium-sized busi­nesses re­port­ing an uptick in hir­ing af­ter months of fur­loughs and freezes. And there’s a good chance you may be do­ing more work for the same amount of money since the lay­offs, as your com­pany’s be­come leaner.</p>
    <p>At this point, you can, with more con­fi­dence, pro­ceed to ask for a 10 per cent or 15 per cent raise to help com­pen­sate for all your ex­tra work in the af­ter­math.</p>
    <p>PRE­PARE TO ASK FOR MORE THAN JUST MONEY</p>
    <p>Of­ten my ad­vice for any­one who asks for a raise but fails to get it is: do not leave the ne­go­ti­a­tion emp­ty­handed. If your com­pany can’t swing a salary hike, how about a stipend for child­care so that you can con­tinue to fo­cus on work while your chil­dren are home this au­tumn from school? And while we’re at it, if your cor­po­rate ben­e­fits are lag­ging, how about a proper flex-spend­ing ac­count? A short-term dis­abil­ity plan? Maybe you can even ne­go­ti­ate ev­ery other Fri­day off to bet­ter man­age the home front? More money is ideal, but gain­ing back some time and san­ity can prove in­valu­able – now more than ever.</p>
