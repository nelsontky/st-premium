    <p>The right poli­cies need to be in place to give women real choices when it comes to bal­anc­ing work and home re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, said Min­is­ter of State for So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment Sun Xuel­ing. Now that a wide-rang­ing re­view into women’s devel­op­ment has be­gun, it may be time to ex­am­ine if ap­pro­pri­ate schemes are in place, she added.</p>
    <p>The right poli­cies need to be in place to give women real choices when it comes to bal­anc­ing work and home re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, said Min­is­ter of State for So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment as well as Ed­u­ca­tion Sun Xuel­ing.</p>
    <p>Now that a wide-rang­ing re­view of women’s devel­op­ment has be­gun, it may be time to ex­am­ine if ap­pro­pri­ate schemes are in place, for in­stance, to help women bal­ance a ca­reer with care­giv­ing re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, she added.</p>
    <p>It may also be worth look­ing at whether ex­ist­ing ar­range­ments, such as flexi­work, go far enough in help­ing women jug­gle their com­mit­ments, Ms Sun said.</p>
    <p>These were some of the is­sues raised by stake­hold­ers on Sun­day dur­ing a di­a­logue that saw the par­tic­i­pa­tion of Ms Sun, Min­is­ter of State for Cul­ture, Community and Youth as well as Trade and In­dus­try Low Yen Ling, and Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary for Health Ra­hayu Mahzam.</p>
    <p>The di­a­logue – the first of many – was part of ef­forts to gather ideas and sug­ges­tions that will form the ba­sis of a White Pa­per to be de­liv­ered in the first half of next year, said Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam on Sun­day, when he an­nounced the re­view.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun said the re­view will be a “whole-of-so­ci­ety ex­er­cise”.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times yes­ter­day for its daily show The Big Story, Ms Sun said: “We’re go­ing to have to speak to peo­ple across dif­fer­ent age groups, dif­fer­ent sec­tors, and from all walks of life, to get a sense of what they think about how far we have come, and what more we can do.</p>
    <p>“So, we hope to reach out to the peo­ple and pri­vate sec­tors, and we hope to work with vol­un­tary wel­fare or­gan­i­sa­tions,” she said.</p>
    <p>Part­ner or­gan­i­sa­tions such as the Sin­ga­pore Coun­cil of Women’s Or­gan­i­sa­tions and Na­tional Trades Union Congress will or­gan­ise these con­ver­sa­tions, she added.</p>
    <p>The re­ac­tion from Sin­ga­pore­ans to the re­view has been very en­cour­ag­ing, said Ms Sun. “A few hours af­ter the con­ver­sa­tion we had yes­ter­day, I had many e-mails come in, text mes­sages, peo­ple from dif­fer­ent or­gan­i­sa­tions, dif­fer­ent walks of life want­ing to be in­volved in these con­ver­sa­tions.”</p>
    <p>She said the ini­tial es­ti­mate was to have about 10 to 12 of the en­gage­ment di­a­logues, but now per­haps sev­eral more will be needed.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, par­tic­i­pants homed in on a raft of is­sues they felt needed to be tack­led. These in­clude work­place dis­crim­i­na­tion and the gen­der pay gap, as well as ca­sual sex­ism, gen­der stereo­types and re­spect for women, said Ms Sun.</p>
    <p>Is­sues such as fam­ily vi­o­lence to­wards women and con­cerns about the dis­pro­por­tion­ate bur­den of care­giv­ing re­spon­si­bil­i­ties fall­ing on women were also raised.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Sun: “I think the pan­demic has cast a spot­light on these ar­eas, and also, how do we weigh the con­tri­bu­tions of women who are home­mak­ers, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>“And in the work­place and school en­vi­ron­ments, there are questions such as: Is there work­place dis­crim­i­na­tion or gen­der pay gap? And are there ap­pro­pri­ate poli­cies in place to en­sure that women – when we say that they have choices – that they have real choices?”</p>
    <p>When asked, Ms Sun said the re­view could lead to pol­icy or struc­tural changes. “We hope that this set of rec­om­men­da­tions is go­ing to be broad and far-reach­ing enough, set­ting out our po­si­tion as a so­ci­ety as to how we see women’s devel­op­ment and gen­der equal­ity.”</p>
    <p>The White Pa­per, she added, will be de­bated in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>“And af­ter that, if there is a need for pol­icy changes, or leg­isla­tive changes, then we will ad­dress it at that point,” she said.</p>
