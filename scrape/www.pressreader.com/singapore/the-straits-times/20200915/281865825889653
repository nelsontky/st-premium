    <p>ISKANDAR PUTERI • The Jo­hor state gov­ern­ment is plan­ning to build a 350m cov­ered walk­way for pedes­tri­ans on the Malaysian side of the Cause­way, at a cost of RM30 mil­lion (S$9.9 mil­lion), a se­nior Jo­hor of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>Once com­pleted, the project would make it more com­fort­able for the hun­dreds of peo­ple who walk across the land link con­nect­ing Jo­hor Baru to Wood­lands, said Mr Mohd Soli­han Badri, Jo­hor’s state ex­ec­u­tive coun­cil­lor for the pub­lic works, in­fra­struc­ture and trans­port com­mit­tee on Sun­day, as quoted by Ber­nama news agency.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the coro­n­avirus pan­demic led to the gen­eral clo­sure of the Cause­way, more than 300,000 peo­ple used the land link each day, in­clud­ing some 100,000 who com­muted daily to work in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Most com­muters used mo­tor­cy­cles, cars and buses to get across what is re­puted to be the world’s busiest bor­der cross­ing.</p>
    <p>But in nor­mal times, hun­dreds of peo­ple are of­ten seen walk­ing across the Cause­way daily to reach the other side faster due to the traf­fic snarls.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s fed­eral gov­ern­ment has dou­bled its ini­tial al­lo­ca­tion of RM15 mil­lion after the walk­way was re­designed, with the ad­di­tion of es­ca­la­tors and air-con­di­tion­ing, Mr Mohd Soli­han told re­porters on the side­lines of the Jo­hor state assem­bly pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>“The con­struc­tion will in­volve the Home Min­istry and Works Min­istry as the Jo­hor Cause­way is main­tained by the Malaysian High­way</p>
    <p>Au­thor­ity,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Mohd Soli­han did not say whether the cov­ered walk­way would be built on pedes­trian paths on the ex­ist­ing 1km road link, or whether a new struc­ture would be added by the side of the link.</p>
    <p>“The dis­tance of 350m ends at the bor­der with Sin­ga­pore. How­ever, for Sin­ga­pore, I’m not sure how long the dis­tance is go­ing to be,” Ber­nama quoted him as say­ing.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Mr Mohd Soli­han, pedes­tri­ans are ac­tu­ally pro­hib­ited on the Jo­hor Cause­way, but the au­thor­i­ties have not taken any ac­tion against them.</p>
    <p>He said Sin­ga­pore Con­sulate of­fi­cials in Jo­hor Baru whom he met had ex­pressed in­ter­est in the project, Ber­nama re­ported.</p>
