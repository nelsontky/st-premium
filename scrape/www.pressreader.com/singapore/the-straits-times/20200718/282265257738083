    <p>Straits Times se­nior health cor­re­spon­dent Salma Kha­lik was trou­bled by how com­plaints about a doc­tor can take more than seven years to be heard (Med­i­cal watch­dog body needs to move out of slow lane, July 16).</p>
    <p>She ex­pressed her con­cern that pa­tients may be put at risk by such de­lays, and con­cluded by say­ing that the Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal Coun­cil should find a way for ur­gent cases to be fast-tracked.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the med­i­cal pro­fes­sion can take a leaf out of the le­gal pro­fes­sion’s book.</p>
    <p>In 2001, then Law Min­is­ter S. Jayaku­mar said dur­ing the sec­ond reading of the Le­gal Pro­fes­sion (Amend­ment) Bill that the Law So­ci­ety re­ceived more than 100 com­plaints a year, but more than half were with­out sub­stance.</p>
    <p>To en­sure that the dis­ci­plinary process was not slowed down, a new ma­chin­ery known as the re­view com­mit­tee was in­tro­duced to act as a sift­ing mech­a­nism.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery com­plaint will first go through a re­view com­mit­tee con­sist­ing of two mem­bers – a lawyer of at least 12 years’ stand­ing and a le­gal of­fi­cer with at least 10 years’ ex­pe­ri­ence – which will have two weeks to de­cide whether there is suf­fi­cient sub­stance in the com­plaint to war­rant an in­quiry.</p>
    <p>A re­view com­mit­tee does not have a blank cheque to dis­miss any case. Its man­date is lim­ited. It can dis­miss a case only if both mem­bers agree that the com­plaint is friv­o­lous, vex­a­tious, mis­con­ceived or lack­ing in sub­stance. This ar­range­ment sought to care­fully bal­ance the need for an ef­fi­cient dis­ci­plinary process and the need to en­sure that ev­ery com­plaint is looked into as thor­oughly as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>It has been 19 years since the in­tro­duc­tion of the re­view com­mit­tee. The mech­a­nism seems to have worked well.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal Coun­cil should con­sider some­thing akin to a re­view com­mit­tee.</p>
