    <p>• With Liverpool fac­ing an in­jury cri­sis at the back – Vir­gil van Dijk and Fabinho are on the side­lines, while Joel Matip is a se­ri­ous doubt – man­ager Jur­gen Klopp will be re­lieved that Michail An­to­nio will not be spear­head­ing West Ham’s at­tack.</p>
    <p>The Ham­mers travel to An­field to­day, but are with­out their joint­top scorer for the Premier League clash, man­ager David Moyes con­firmed.</p>
    <p>At his vir­tual pre-match press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, the Scot said An­to­nio, who has three league goals this sea­son and is his firstchoic­e for­ward, will not be risked af­ter ag­gra­vat­ing an in­jury against Manch­ester City last week­end.</p>
    <p>Moyes added: “Michail has been great for us and has played re­ally well. We don’t think it’s too bad but it’s enough to keep him out of to­mor­row’s game.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing trounced Leicester and Wolves, and gained cred­i­ble draws at Tot­ten­ham and City, un­fan­cied West Ham are in form. Even with­out An­to­nio, Moyes is fan­cy­ing his chances of an­other sur­prise re­sult.</p>
    <p>The Scot said: “Ob­vi­ously, you’d rather play Liverpool with­out Vir­gil van Dijk, but maybe they’re look­ing at it in the same way with us and Michail.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing up there with no crowd be­hind them hope­fully might make a dif­fer­ence too.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think we’ve ex­ceeded ex­pec­ta­tions. I al­ways put the team out to get re­sults, but I was re­ally pleased with the points we took against Spurs and City. It showed the di­rec­tion we’re tak­ing.</p>
    <p>“Play­ing the champions will al­ways be a tough game. We have to try to make the most of it and I think we’re in a good place. The play­ers have got con­fi­dence and I hope we can go and show it.”</p>
    <p>Thi­ago Al­can­tara, Naby Keita, Kostas Tsimikas and Matip – all of whom have missed the Reds’ past three games – were not seen in train­ing on Thurs­day, putting their avail­abil­ity into ques­tion.</p>
    <p>Klopp has al­ready hinted he will not rush back his in­jured play­ers ahead of sched­ule, sug­gest­ing academy grad­u­ate Rhys Wil­liams is in line for his Premier League de­but to­day along­side Joe Gomez, the club’s only fit se­nior cen­tre­back at the mo­ment.</p>
    <p>With the rangy French striker Se­bastien Haller likely to come in for An­to­nio, it may suit the hosts as the vis­i­tors are set to play a di­rect game.</p>
    <p>At 1.96m, Wil­liams, who last sea­son was on loan at non-league side Kid­der­min­ster Har­ri­ers, can bring height to the Reds’ back­line, and pun­dit Jamie Car­ragher feels he of­fers some­thing dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>The for­mer Liverpool de­fender told talkS­port yes­ter­day: “What he does give you is a great size and great aerial abil­ity that Fabinho or Gomez don’t give you.”</p>
    <p>LIVERPOOL V WEST HAM</p>
