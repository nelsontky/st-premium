    <p>•</p>
    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES Tele­vi­sion rat­ings for the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) Fi­nals have fallen to record lows but the slump is part of a broader trend caused by a sport­ing cal­en­dar thrown into chaos by Covid-19, in­dus­try an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>While there were high-qual­ity per­for­mances i n the first four games, the bas­ket­ball show­piece has failed to cap­ture its usual US tele­vi­sion au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>Game 1 was watched by 7.41 mil­lion peo­ple ac­cord­ing to fig­ures from Sports Me­dia Watch, which analy­ses Amer­i­can sports, com­pared to 13.4 mil­lion view­ers for last year’s Game 1 in late May.</p>
    <p>Game 2 num­bers fell to 6.61 mil­lion while Game 3 tum­bled fur­ther to 5.94 mil­lion, the low­est to­tal recorded for an NBA Fi­nals game.</p>
    <p>Game 4 – in which the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers won to take a 3-1 lead over the Mi­ami Heat – im­proved to 7.54 mil­lion view­ers but still de­clined 41 per cent from last year.</p>
    <p>With the pan­demic send­ing sport in North Amer­ica into a shut­down in March, the NBA was able to re­turn only in late July.</p>
    <p>Game 1 clashed with Ma­jor League Baseball play-off games in­volv­ing the Los An­ge­les Dodgers (1.1 mil­lion) as well as the New York Yan­kees (2.5 mil­lion), draw­ing view­ers from the two big­gest me­dia mar­kets in the United States.</p>
    <p>Game 3 went head-to-head with the 15 mil­lion watch­ing Na­tional Foot­ball League’s tra­di­tional “Sun­day Night Foot­ball”, a sta­ple of week­end sports tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing up head-to-head with the NFL and MLB post-sea­son is a first, and the com­pe­ti­tion has had a neg­a­tive ef­fect on au­di­ence de­liv­ery,” me­dia con­sul­tant Brad Adgate told the Front Of­fice Sports web­site.</p>
    <p>Fierce com­pe­ti­tion from the news cy­cle – the Fi­nals are be­ing held just weeks away from the</p>
    <p>Nov 3 US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion – is an­other drain on rat­ings, ex­perts ar­gue.</p>
    <p>The NBA is also far from alone in in­cur­ring steep de­clines.</p>
    <p>Ice hockey’s Stan­ley Cup Fi­nal av­er­age view­ing fig­ures fell by around 61 per cent, while the US Open golf Ma­jor’s fi­nal round dived 56 per cent to an all-time low.</p>
    <p>Both US horse rac­ing clas­sics, the Ken­tucky Derby and Preak­ness, also reg­is­tered sharp drops, plung­ing 43 per cent and 31 per cent re­spec­tively, as well as mo­tor sports’ In­di­anapo­lis 500, which fell 32 per cent to an all-time low.</p>
