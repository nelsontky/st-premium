    <p>The dry sea­son in South-east Asia is just around the corner, but the re­gion could ex­pe­ri­ence some re­lief from haze this year.</p>
    <p>Should a cli­mate phe­nom­e­non known as La Nina de­velop – as mod­els are pre­dict­ing it to – there could be rain even in the usu­ally dry months.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) said on its web­site that its El Nino South­ern Os­cil­la­tion mon­i­tor­ing sys­tem has changed from a “neu­tral sta­tus” to “La Nina watch” this month.</p>
    <p>La Nina and El Nino are phases of a cli­mate phe­nom­e­non known as the El Nino South­ern Os­cil­la­tion. They have op­po­site ef­fects on the weather over the mar­itime con­ti­nent, which in­cludes Sin­ga­pore and In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>El Nino causes drier and hot­ter weather here, while La Nina brings with it more rain.</p>
    <p>An NEA spokesman said ma­jor cli­mate cen­tres are pre­dict­ing La Nina con­di­tions to de­velop over the equa­to­rial Pa­cific Ocean in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>“This will in­crease the chance of above nor­mal rain­fall over many parts of the re­gion in the up­com­ing dry sea­son, and re­duce the risk of wide­spread land and for­est fires,” he said.</p>
    <p>The NEA spokesman added that while a re­peat of last year’s haze sit­u­a­tion is not so likely, some parts of Su­ma­tra and Kal­i­man­tan may still ex­pe­ri­ence drier weather and a risk of fires.</p>
    <p>After years of rel­a­tively clear skies, Sin­ga­pore was last year plagued once again by the scourge of haze. While it was not as bad as the chok­ing pol­lu­tion that blan­keted the re­gion in 2015, the haze caused un­healthy air qual­ity in Sin­ga­pore for a few weeks. In In­done­sia and Malaysia, where the sit­u­a­tion was far worse, schools were closed and flights grounded.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Koh Tieh Yong, a weather sci­en­tist at the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences, said mod­els pre­dict the on­set of La Nina from around Septem­ber. “That means we still have the dry months of Au­gust and early Septem­ber for for­est fires to pro­duce smoke haze if they get out of con­trol,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of prov­inces in In­done­sia – in­clud­ing Riau, Jambi, South Su­ma­tra, West Kal­i­man­tan, Cen­tral Kal­i­man­tan and East Kal­i­man­tan – have al­ready de­clared a state of emer­gency as the coun­try braces it­self for its an­nual fire sea­son.</p>
    <p>Prof Koh noted that while heav­ier rain could help douse fires, this does not pre­clude the pos­si­bil­ity of haze. “Fires can still oc­cur be­cause hu­mans would in­ten­tion­ally choose the non-rain­ing days to start their burn­ing,” he noted.</p>
    <p>“Whether small-scale fires gen­er­ate enough smoke to cause a re­gional haze prob­lem de­pends on how ram­pant the il­le­gal burn­ing is and how ef­fec­tive the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties are in stop­ping it. So hu­mans ex­ert a con­sid­er­able, un­pre­dictable in­flu­ence in this.”</p>
    <p>Fires in In­done­sia can be started by ac­ci­dent, or de­lib­er­ately to clear land. And be­cause they take place on car­bon-rich peat­lands – nat­u­rally wa­ter­logged ecosys­tems that are flammable when drained for agri­cul­ture – the fires can burn un­der­ground and for days on end, caus­ing them to spi­ral out of con­trol.</p>
    <p>Last Mon­day, the NEA and the Min­istry of Health (MOH) in­tro­duced a guide to the hourly av­er­age con­cen­tra­tion of fine par­tic­u­late mat­ter (PM2.5) – a key pol­lu­tant dur­ing pe­ri­ods of haze – to help in­di­vid­u­als de­cide on im­me­di­ate out­door ac­tiv­i­ties dur­ing haze pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>When hourly PM2.5 con­cen­tra­tions are in band one, for ex­am­ple, nor­mal ac­tiv­i­ties can be car­ried out. When con­cen­tra­tions creep up to higher bands, out­door ac­tiv­i­ties should ei­ther be re­duced, avoided or min­imised, de­pend­ing on the type of ac­tiv­ity, and whether the per­son per­form­ing them is el­derly, preg­nant, a child, or has pre-ex­ist­ing health con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>The guide was rolled out after re­peated calls from mem­bers of the pub­lic dur­ing ear­lier haze episodes for more guid­ance on how hourly pol­lu­tant read­ings should be in­ter­preted. Pre­vi­ously, only the 24-hour Pol­lu­tant Stan­dards In­dex (PSI) read­ings came with ad­vi­sories.</p>
    <p>NEA and MOH said in re­sponse to queries that they have re­ceived feed­back that many res­i­dents would ap­pre­ci­ate a per­sonal guide for the haze sit­u­a­tion for the pur­pose of plan­ning im­me­di­ate out­door ac­tiv­i­ties, like go­ing for a jog. But they also said that un­like the 24-hour PSI health ad­vi­sory, which is sup­ported by sci­en­tific ev­i­dence, there is lim­ited ev­i­dence on the long-term health im­pact of short-term ex­po­sure to pol­lu­tants.</p>
    <p>The 24-hour PSI forecast will still be used to im­ple­ment ac­tion plans to min­imise and man­age the im­pact of haze on Sin­ga­pore, and ad­vise on ma­jor de­ci­sions such as school clo­sures and sus­pen­sion of train­ing or out­door work, said the agen­cies.</p>
