    <p>BANGKOK • In Thai­land’s democ­racy, emoti­cons and retweets are be­com­ing the new bal­lots.</p>
    <p>Protest or­gan­is­ers on Mon­day asked sup­port­ers on Face­book whether they should hold ral­lies that evening: The “Care” emoti­con sig­nalled “rest for one day”, while the “Wow” emoti­con was a vote to</p>
    <p>“keep go­ing”. The ma­jor­ity on Face­book chose to con­tinue the protests.</p>
    <p>A sim­i­lar poll was done on Twit­ter, us­ing like and retweet buttons for the vote.</p>
    <p>So­cial me­dia plat­forms like Face­book, Twit­ter and Tele­gram have emerged as the back­bone of the youth-led move­ment pos­ing an un­prece­dented chal­lenge to King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn and Thai­land’s roy­al­ist es­tab­lish­ment.</p>
    <p>Mir­ror­ing the “Be Wa­ter” tac­tics mas­tered by pro­test­ers in Hong Kong last year, the de­cen­tralised move­ment in Thai­land is us­ing on­line fo­rums to ask sup­port­ers to vote on when and where to rally – some­times choos­ing mul­ti­ple lo­ca­tions at once.</p>
    <p>The moves have kept the po­lice off bal­ance. The au­thor­i­ties last week shut down parts of Bangkok and some mass tran­sit sta­tions in an un­suc­cess­ful bid to stop pro­test­ers from gath­er­ing.</p>
    <p>They have now held ral­lies each day since Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha is­sued an emer­gency de­cree to ban large gath­er­ings. And while po­lice have ar­rested more than 70 peo­ple, in­clud­ing prom­i­nent lead­ers, others are lined up to take their place as pro­test­ers push for Mr Prayut’s res­ig­na­tion, a more demo­cratic Con­sti­tu­tion and more ac­count­abil­ity for a monar­chy that holds more power and wealth than any in­sti­tu­tion in Thai­land.</p>
    <p>“We’re al­ready cre­at­ing a headache for the gov­ern­ment just by do­ing lead­er­less ral­lies to show them that peo­ple are against them,” said protest or­gan­iser Arthi­taya</p>
    <p>Pornprom. “We’re show­ing them that even though the lead­ers are gone, the move­ment con­tin­ues. Ev­ery­body’s a leader.”</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, pro­test­ers used so­cial me­dia to gather at a new lo­ca­tion within an hour af­ter po­lice thwarted their ini­tial plans. Since then, they have been reg­u­larly pop­ping up at var­i­ous lo­ca­tions for a short pe­riod of time be­fore dis­pers­ing quickly to avoid crack­downs.</p>
    <p>Al­though Thai­land has long dealt with street protests, these tac­tics are all new in Bangkok.</p>
    <p>In pre­vi­ous years, po­lice had to con­tend with demon­stra­tors backed by ma­jor po­lit­i­cal fig­ures who oc­cu­pied streets or strate­gic lo­ca­tions like the in­ter­na­tional air­port for days or weeks.</p>
    <p>Now the move­ment is based in cy­berspace and the au­thor­i­ties are strug­gling to stop it.</p>
    <p>Any ban on plat­forms such as Face­book would up­set more than 50 million ac­tive users in Thai­land – equiv­a­lent to more than 70 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion – who use so­cial me­dia to chat, shop as well as fol­low cur­rent events.</p>
    <p>Past gov­ern­ment threats to take le­gal ac­tion against so­cial me­dia giants have not ma­te­ri­alised, even though some posts and pages have been re­moved or blocked.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment has found it hard to sup­press this kind of lead­er­less, cy­ber-or­gan­is­ing move­ment,” said Dr David Streck­fuss, a scholar of South-east Asian pol­i­tics and an au­thor of a book on Thai­land’s lese ma­jeste laws. “They could shut down so­cial me­dia... but it’ll come at a price.</p>
