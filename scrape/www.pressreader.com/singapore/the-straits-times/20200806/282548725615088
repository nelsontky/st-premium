    <p>TOKYO • It is a block­buster ex­hi­bi­tion, fea­tur­ing some of the big­gest names in Ja­pan’s con­tem­po­rary art scene. But will peo­ple still flock to gal­leries in the midst of the global coron­avirus pan­demic?</p>
    <p>That is the ques­tion on the mind of Ms Mami Kataoka, di­rec­tor of the in­flu­en­tial Mori Art Mu­seum, which re­opened last Fri­day af­ter a five-month hia­tus with one of its most high­pro­file Ja­panese art shows in years.</p>
    <p>“We live in a time when we are asked, ‘What is the role of mu­se­ums and what is the role of art?’” Ms Kataoka said at a press pre­view of the Stars ex­hi­bi­tion last week.</p>
    <p>The ex­hi­bi­tion was sup­posed to open in April, run­ning through the sum­mer to at­tract vis­i­tors in town for the Olympics, with works by lead­ing Ja­panese art fig­ures such as Yayoi Kusama and Takashi Mu­rakami.</p>
    <p>But the coron­avirus has forced a year-long de­lay of the Olympic Games and the mu­seum closed its doors in Fe­bru­ary as in­fec­tions be­gan to climb in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>“In this si­t­u­a­tion, it’s dif­fi­cult to man­age (a mu­seum),” Ms Kataoka said.</p>
    <p>The ex­hi­bi­tion is go­ing ahead de­spite the chal­lenges, even as Tokyo Gov­er­nor Yuriko Koike has warned of a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions in the cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>The star-stud­ded ex­hi­bi­tion fea­tures well-known works such as Mu­rakami’s Miss Ko2 sculpture, which is im­bued with el­e­ments of Ja­panese “otaku” sub­cul­ture, as well as Kusama’s ab­stract In­fin­ity Nets paint­ings. It also show­cases works by Hiroshi Sugi­moto, Lee Ufan and Yoshit­omo Nara, who is now pre­par­ing a ma­jor ret­ro­spec­tive in Los An­ge­les.</p>
    <p>Ms Kataoka said the show fea­tures artists who burst onto the global art scene af­ter strug­gling for years in rel­a­tive ob­scu­rity.</p>
    <p>Some rep­re­sent min­i­mal­ist styles and oth­ers favour less tra­di­tional aes­thet­ics, draw­ing from an­i­ma­tion, pop cul­ture and other sub­cul­tures.</p>
    <p>“I was grate­ful... that this mu­seum was able to re­open with this pow­er­ful ex­hibit of works by artists with long ca­reers,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ac­claimed installati­on artist and sculp­tor Tat­suo Miya­jima told re­porters the pan­demic will test the art that peo­ple feel they need to see in per­son.</p>
    <p>“We now only go to places and see peo­ple we re­ally need to see and visit,” said Miya­jima, who is ex­hibit­ing at the show.</p>
    <p>“I think there will be a se­lec­tion process and mu­se­ums are not ex­empt from that. Peo­ple will come to see things they truly need to see.”</p>
    <p>Ja­pan has seen a smaller virus caseload than many coun­tries, with around 39,000 in­fec­tions and more than 1,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>But Tokyo is see­ing a spike in cases and the au­thor­i­ties have warned more mea­sures may be needed if in­fec­tions rise fur­ther.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors to the show will be asked to book in ad­vance, wear masks and sani­tise their hands fre­quently. In a bid to re­coup costs, the mu­seum is rais­ing prices and stretch­ing the ex­hi­bi­tion’s run longer.</p>
    <p>De­spite the chal­lenges, Ms Kataoka is con­vinced that fans who do come will be pleas­antly sur­prised. “Vis­i­tors will be able to ex­pe­ri­ence the show in this un­crowded space. I think you’ll see an im­prove­ment in the qual­ity of the view­ing ex­pe­ri­ence,” she said.</p>
