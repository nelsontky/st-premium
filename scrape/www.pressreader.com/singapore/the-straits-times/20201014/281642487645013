    <p>•</p>
    <p>The polling date for Malaysia’s Batu Sapi by-elec­tion in Sabah has been set for Dec 5, the coun­try’s Elec­tion Com­mis­sion an­nounced yesterday.</p>
    <p>Elec­tion Com­mis­sion chair­man Ab­dul Ghani Salleh said a spe­cial meet­ing had fixed Nom­i­na­tion Day for Nov 23. Early vot­ing to elect a new law­maker for the par­lia­men­tary ward in Sabah is on Dec 1.</p>
    <p>Datuk Ab­dul Ghani said di­rect, house-to-house cam­paign­ing, walk­a­bouts and ce­ramah (po­lit­i­cal rally) would not be al­lowed dur­ing the cam­paign pe­riod to pre­vent the coro­n­avirus from spread­ing fur­ther.</p>
    <p>Sabah is cur­rently un­der move­ment re­stric­tions for two weeks un­til Oct 26 be­cause of a surge in Covid-19 cases, fol­low­ing an out­break at a de­ten­tion cen­tre for il­le­gal mi­grants.</p>
    <p>“We en­cour­age can­di­dates for this by-elec­tion to cam­paign via so­cial me­dia plat­forms, as di­rect cam­paign­ing ex­poses those in­volved to the virus,” Mr Ab­dul Ghani said.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the 12-day cam­paign, can­di­dates can op­er­ate only one com­mand cen­tre and mini op­er­a­tion cen­tres will not be al­lowed.</p>
    <p>Mr Ab­dul Ghani also said that the Elec­tion Com­mis­sion could not post­pone the by-elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“The Fed­eral Con­sti­tu­tion stip­u­lates that the com­mis­sion must hold an elec­tion within 60 days af­ter it falls va­cant. This can only be post­poned if the gov­ern­ment de­clares an emer­gency,” he said.</p>
    <p>“On our part, we can raise the is­sue and make rec­om­men­da­tions if the Covid-19 pan­demic turns for the worst. But it has to be the gov­ern­ment that makes the de­ci­sion.”</p>
    <p>The com­mis­sion chair­man added that the by-elec­tion would re­quire an al­lo­ca­tion of more than RM5 mil­lion (S$1.6 mil­lion) due to the pan­demic. There are nearly 33,000 reg­is­tered vot­ers in Batu Sapi.</p>
    <p>The Batu Sapi seat fell va­cant fol­low­ing the death of Mr Liew Vui Keong on Oct 2, be­lieved to be due to a lung in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The for­mer min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Depart­ment had ear­lier been ad­mit­ted to the Jes­sel­ton Med­i­cal Cen­tre for a slipped disc prior to the Sept 12 nom­i­na­tion day for Sabah state elec­tions, and was trans­ferred to the Gle­nea­gles Hospi­tal for fur­ther med­i­cal at­ten­tion. His con­di­tion took a turn for the worse when he was di­ag­nosed with a lung in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Barisan Na­sional has said that it will not con­test the Batu Sapi by­elec­tion to pre­vent fur­ther spread of Covid-19. Parti Cinta Sabah has also de­clared that it will not con­test in the up­com­ing elec­tion.</p>
