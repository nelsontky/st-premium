    <p>NEW YORK • The United States Olympic and Par­a­lympic Com­mit­tee (USOPC) an­nounced on Thurs­day that it would no longer pun­ish ath­letes who par­tic­i­pate in peace­ful protests, such as kneel­ing or rais­ing a fist at a medal cer­e­mony, putting it­self in direct con­flict with the In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee’s (IOC) long­stand­ing pol­icy.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment was made in con­junc­tion with a rec­om­men­da­tion from a coun­cil led by US ath­letes that asked the IOC to change its pol­icy, known as Rule 50, while work­ing on jus­tice causes.</p>
    <p>The pol­icy has come un­der height­ened scru­tiny as mass protests call­ing for racial equal­ity, in­clud­ing demon­stra­tions by pro­fes­sional ath­letes, have spread widely this year in the US and other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“It is crit­i­cal to state un­equiv­o­cally that hu­man rights are not po­lit­i­cal, and peace­ful calls for eq­uity and equal­ity must not be con­fused with di­vi­sive demon­stra­tions,” Sarah Hir­sh­land, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of the USOPC, said in a let­ter to US Olympic ath­letes.</p>
    <p>Rule 50 of the Olympic Char­ter pro­hibits in­di­vid­u­als from demon­strat­ing or dis­play­ing “po­lit­i­cal, re­li­gious or racial pro­pa­ganda” around Olympic sites dur­ing the Games.</p>
    <p>It was in­voked, for ex­am­ple, at the 1968 Sum­mer Olympics in Mexico, where US sprint­ers John Car­los and Tom­mie Smith were ex­pelled from the Games for rais­ing their fists on the podium as the StarS­pan­gled Ban­ner was played.</p>
    <p>As re­cently as Oc­to­ber, IOC pres­i­dent Thomas Bach re­it­er­ated his po­si­tion that he did not want the Olympics to be­come a “mar­ket­place of demon­stra­tions”.</p>
    <p>For now, the USOPC’s change in pol­icy does not mean that US ath­letes will be free to protest at the Tokyo Olympics next year with­out the threat of pun­ish­ment.</p>
    <p>In prac­tice, the IOC has his­tor­i­cally called on in­di­vid­ual or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tees to dole out pun­ish­ments for vi­o­la­tions, although it can bar or ex­pel ath­letes from the Games or strip them of their medals.</p>
    <p>Last year, for in­stance, t he USOPC rep­ri­manded fencer Race Im­bo­den and ham­mer thrower Gwen Berry, who knelt and raised a fist dur­ing their medal cer­e­monies at the Pan Amer­i­can Games.</p>
    <p>Both were given formal warn­ings and placed on pro­ba­tion for 12 months, but the USOPC has since apol­o­gised for those pun­ish­ments, pledg­ing not to pun­ish ath­letes for sim­i­lar acts of peace­ful protest.</p>
    <p>The IOC is also re­view­ing the rule – it has or­gan­ised fo­rums and sur­veys with Olympians around the world – and some ob­servers feel the an­nounce­ment will sig­nif­i­cantly shape that con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of its stature, “it does make a dif­fer­ence in terms of what the dis­course is go­ing to be at the IOC around this is­sue,” said Han Xiao, chair­man of the USOPC’s ath­letes’ ad­vi­sory coun­cil.</p>
    <p>World Ath­let­ics pres­i­dent Se­bas­tian Coe has backed the USOPC’s stance, say­ing: “I sup­port the right of ath­letes to be a part of the world we live in, and I don’t think we can have it both ways.</p>
    <p>“As long as they do it re­spect­fully, with due deference that there will be other ath­letes on that podium with them, I am not go­ing to get sleep­less nights on this.”</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, record 23-time gold medal­list Michael Phelps has said that the dis­rup­tion re­sult­ing from Covid-19 means that it is un­likely any swim­ming world records will fall at next year’s Games.</p>
    <p>“Hon­estly, I think that push­ing it back by a year throws a big­ger loop into it than ev­ery­body thinks,” the Amer­i­can said.</p>
    <p>“The best of the best will fight back and you’re go­ing to see some fast swims. But world records? I don’t think so. With all th­ese pools be­ing shut down, some­body would have to be damn near per­fect for the rest of the prepa­ra­tion to have that chance.”</p>
    <p>I sup­port the right of ath­letes to be a part of the world we live in... As long as they do it re­spect­fully, with due deference that there will be other ath­letes on that podium with them, I am not go­ing to get sleep­less nights on this.</p>
    <p>SE­BAS­TIAN COE, World Ath­let­ics pres­i­dent, sup­port­ing USOPC’s stance.</p>
