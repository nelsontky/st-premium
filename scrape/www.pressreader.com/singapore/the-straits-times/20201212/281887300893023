    <p>LON­DON/BRUSSELS • Bri­tain is likely to leave the Euro­pean Union with­out a trade deal in just un­der three weeks’ time, Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son and Euro­pean Com­mis­sion chief Ur­sula von der Leyen said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain quit the EU in Jan­uary but re­mains an in­for­mal mem­ber un­til Dec 31 – the end of a tran­si­tion pe­riod dur­ing which it has re­mained in the EU sin­gle mar­ket and Cus­toms union.</p>
    <p>Both sides said they want to agree on ar­range­ments to cover nearly US$1 tril­lion (S$1.3 tril­lion) in an­nual trade, but talks are at an im­passe. “The prob­a­bil­ity of a no deal is higher than of a deal,” an EU of­fi­cial who de­clined to be iden­ti­fied quoted Ms von der Leyen as say­ing dur­ing an EU sum­mit in Brussels.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son told re­porters: “It’s look­ing very, very likely we’ll have to go for a so­lu­tion that I think will be won­der­ful for the UK, we’ll be able to do ex­actly what we want from Jan 1, it will ob­vi­ously be dif­fer­ent from what we set out to achieve.</p>
    <p>“If there’s a big of­fer, a big change in what they’re say­ing, then I must say that I’ve yet to see it.”</p>
    <p>Mr John­son and Ms von der Leyen have given ne­go­tia­tors un­til to­mor­row evening to break the im­passe at talks that are dead­locked over fish­ing rights and EU de­mands for Bri­tain to face con­se­quences if, in the fu­ture, it di­verges from the bloc’s rules.</p>
    <p>In the case of a “no deal” on trade, Bri­tain would lose zero-tar­iff and zero-quota ac­cess to the Euro­pean sin­gle mar­ket of 450 mil­lion con­sumers overnight.</p>
    <p>Ms von der Leyen said it would be clear to­mor­row whether the con­di­tions for a deal had been reached.</p>
    <p>“It is only fair that com­peti­tors to our own en­ter­prises face the same con­di­tions on our own mar­ket,” she told a news con­fer­ence in Brussels.</p>
    <p>A se­nior Euro­pean of­fi­cial said EU lead­ers had re­jected a pro­posal from Mr John­son for a Brexit call with Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel and French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>As Euro­pean lead­ers lined up to warn of the fail­ure of talks, in­vestors started to price in the risk of a chaotic fi­nale to the five-year Brexit cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Ster­ling tum­bled, stocks fell and im­plied volatil­ity surged. The pound fell 0.8 per cent against the dol­lar to US$1.3184 be­fore recovering some­what.</p>
    <p>Ital­ian Prime Min­is­ter Giuseppe Conte said there were still fun­da­men­tal is­sues un­re­solved in trade talks. “Time is run­ning out and we need to pre­pare for a hard Brexit,” he said.</p>
    <p>A no-trade deal Brexit would dam­age the economies of north­ern Europe, send shock­waves through fi­nan­cial mar­kets, snarl bor­ders and sow chaos through the del­i­cate sup­ply chains which stretch across Europe and be­yond.</p>
    <p>The EU on Thurs­day pub­lished its own con­tin­gency plans to keep ba­sic air and road travel run­ning and fish­ing rights open in the event of no deal, in a move seen as a warn­ing shot to Lon­don.</p>
    <p>Some EU diplomats have cast Mr John­son’s rhetoric as the­atrics in­tended to wrench out a deal and please his do­mes­tic Brexit sup­port­ers, and Mr Macron said he still hoped a deal could be reached.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron is un­der pres­sure from French fish­er­men not to cede ground over their fish­ing rights. He was asked by a re­porter whether an EU pro­posal for a oneyear con­tin­gency plan, un­der which EU fish­er­men would keep ac­cess to Bri­tain’s fish­ing wa­ters, was akin to “hav­ing your cake and eat­ing it”.</p>
    <p>“I’m not ask­ing to have my cake and eat it, no. All I want is a cake that’s worth its weight. Be­cause I won’t give up my share of it ei­ther,” he said in Brussels.</p>
    <p>The Bank of Eng­land took steps yes­ter­day to keep banks lend­ing through next year as Bri­tain pre­pares for any mar­ket dis­rup­tion from a big change in its trad­ing re­la­tion­ship with the EU.</p>
    <p>Gov­er­nor An­drew Bai­ley said the cen­tral bank was ready to deal with any dis­rup­tions to fi­nan­cial mar­kets.</p>
