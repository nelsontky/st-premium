    <p>MI­AMI • The Mil­wau­kee Bucks be­gan this Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) sea­son in Hous­ton with a 117-111 win be­hind Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo’s game-high points, re­bounds and as­sists.</p>
    <p>Fast for­ward nearly 10 months, through a coro­n­avirus-en­forced hia­tus, and not much has changed.</p>
    <p>An­te­tok­oun­mpo still had a big night, lead­ing the floor at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Com­plex bub­ble near Or­lando on Sun­day in all three cat­e­gories.</p>
    <p>The big dif­fer­ence this time was that the Bucks lost 120-116 to the Rock­ets.</p>
    <p>Rus­sell West­brook scored 31 points and James Har­den added 24 to rally Hous­ton over NBA over­all lead­ers Mil­wau­kee.</p>
    <p>The Bucks led 112-104 af­ter Khris Mid­dle­ton’s three-pointer with 3min 14sec to play, but Hous­ton closed the game with a 16-4 run. “It’s amaz­ing,” said West­brook. “We fought through. Ad­ver­sity showed up and we showed off. All the guys in our locker room showed up to play for 48 minutes.”</p>
    <p>The Rock­ets went 21-of-61 from three-point range, match­ing an NBA record for the most three­p­oint at­tempts by a club in a nonover­time game, with Danuel House hit­ting four and Har­den among five other play­ers who l anded three from out­side the arc.</p>
    <p>Hous­ton also ral­lied from seven points down in the fi­nal minute to de­feat Dal­las 153-149 on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>West­brook, on a ca­reer-best run of 36 con­sec­u­tive games with 20 or more points, hit 10-of-21 from the floor, one-of-three from be­yond the arc, and 10-of-12 free throws.</p>
    <p>“You have to make the right reads and trust your team­mates and that’s what I tried to do all night long,” added West­brook, who sank four free throws in­side the fi­nal 28.5 sec­onds.</p>
    <p>Har­den had six steals, seven re­bounds and seven as­sists.</p>
    <p>Greek big man An­te­tok­oun­mpo had 36 points, 18 re­bounds and eight as­sists. Mid­dle­ton con­trib­uted 27 points and 12 re­bounds and Brook Lopez added 23 points and 12 re­bounds.</p>
    <p>“We’ve got to keep ex­e­cut­ing at the end of close games,” An­te­tok­oun­mpo said. “We weren’t able to do that. We’ve got to find the open man and hit more shots.</p>
    <p>“Usu­ally when we’re up six two minutes to go, we usu­ally close the game out. But we didn’t do that to­day, so we’ve got to learn from it and got to keep mov­ing.”</p>
    <p>The Rock­ets im­proved to 42-24, level with Utah for fourth in the Western Con­fer­ence and just one game be­hind Den­ver. The Bucks fell to 54-13, still the best record in the NBA and six games bet­ter than reign­ing cham­pi­ons Toronto to top the Eastern Con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“I think our ex­e­cu­tion, our cer­tainty in what we wanted to do wasn’t where it needs to be and that starts with me,” Mil­wau­kee coach Mike Bu­den­holzer said. “So, I think a lot of tonight’s on me.”</p>
    <p>In the other fea­ture in­ter-con­fer­ence game, Jayson Ta­tum scored 34 points and Jaylen Brown added 30 to lead the Bos­ton Celtics to a 128-124 win over the Port­land Trail Blaz­ers.</p>
    <p>The San An­to­nio Spurs, pow­ered by 21 points and 10 re­bounds from De­jounte Mur­ray, edged eighth­place Mem­phis 108-106 in a Western Con­fer­ence game.</p>
    <p>The re­sult en­sured a play-off spot for the Dal­las Mav­er­icks even be­fore their 117-115 loss to the Phoenix Suns. It will be Dal­las’ first post-sea­son ap­pear­ance since 2016.</p>
    <p>EMPTY THE TANK</p>
    <p>It’s amaz­ing. We fought through. Ad­ver­sity showed up and we showed off.</p>
    <p>All the guys in our locker room showed up to play for 48 minutes.</p>
