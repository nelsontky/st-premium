    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia re­ported 260 new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, its big­gest daily jump in in­fec­tions since June 4, mostly due to an out­break in Sabah state, the Health Min­istry said.</p>
    <p>The South-east Asian coun­try has re­ported a to­tal of 11,484 cases of the virus so far, in­clud­ing 136 deaths, Reuters re­ported.</p>
    <p>The jump in cases came af­ter a surge in travel to and from Sabah ahead of state elec­tions last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry’s di­rec­tor­gen­eral, Dr Noor Hisham Ab­dul­lah, said the 260 tally was the sec­ond­high­est in­crease in the num­ber of cases in a sin­gle day, af­ter the 277 cases that were recorded on June 4, caused by an out­break at a Se­lan­gor im­mi­gra­tion de­ten­tion cen­tre at the time.</p>
    <p>The 260 cases in­clude four new clus­ters in Se­lan­gor, Sabah, Putrajaya and Kedah.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Noor Hisham said Se­lan­gor on Tues­day recorded a 1.95 Rt, much higher than the 1.29 Rt in Sabah.</p>
    <p>The Rt value in­di­cates how fast Covid-19 is spread­ing.</p>
    <p>To curb the spread of the virus in Sabah, the fed­eral govern­ment yes­ter­day an­nounced a ban on travel be­tween all 27 dis­tricts in the state, the sec­ond big­gest in Malaysia by land size af­ter Sarawak.</p>
    <p>The re­stric­tions will start at mid­night on Satur­day and will be en­forced for 14 days un­til Oct 16.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter (Se­cu­rity Clus­ter) Is­mail Sabri Yaakob said only es­sen­tial ser­vices such as food sup­plies as well as med­i­cal and se­cu­rity ser­vices that re­quire travel be­tween the dis­tricts will be al­lowed dur­ing this pe­riod, The Star daily re­ported.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment ear­lier placed four Sabah dis­tricts – La­had Datu, Tawau, Ku­nak and Sem­porna – un­der the tar­geted En­hanced Move­ment Con­trol Or­der (EMCO), from Tues­day to Oct 12.</p>
    <p>The EMCO is a strict lock­down that shuts down most busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties, and pre­vents peo­ple from en­ter­ing or leav­ing these dis­tricts.</p>
    <p>The four dis­tricts are on the east coast of Sabah.</p>
    <p>The lock­down was in­sti­tuted af­ter 1,195 Covid-19 cases were recorded in the four dis­tricts since the be­gin­ning of last month.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Malaysian As­so­ci­a­tion of Tour and Travel Agents pres­i­dent Tan Kok Liang has ad­vised trav­ellers eye­ing Sabah to de­fer their hol­i­day plans.</p>
