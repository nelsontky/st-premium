    <p>•</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has forced busi­nesses world­wide to pivot on­line to sur­vive, and many have turned to Shopify, a Cana­dian com­pany that has emerged as a thriv­ing al­ter­na­tive to Ama­zon.</p>
    <p>Founded 15 years ago in Ot­tawa, Shopify al­lows busi­nesses to cre­ate an e-com­merce site in just a few clicks. Al­ready grow­ing with more than one mil­lion e-stores at the end of last year, its user base has ex­ploded.</p>
    <p>“The re­tail world that would have ex­isted in 2030 has re­ally been pulled back into 2020,” Shopify pres­i­dent Har­ley Finkel­stein said.</p>
    <p>“It feels like Covid has per­ma­nently ac­cel­er­ated the growth of on­line com­merce.”</p>
    <p>Amid a l ock­down of phys­i­cal stores, on­line com­merce has boomed this year.</p>
    <p>Con­sumers have grown ac­cus­tomed to buy­ing over the In­ter­net, and in­dus­try giants, led by Ama­zon, have seen sales rocket.</p>
    <p>At the same time, many busi­nesses that did not have a pres­ence or a di­rect on­line sales chan­nel took the plunge as the pan­demic took hold.</p>
    <p>Pop­u­lar with en­trepreneur­s, Shopify saw the num­ber of new stores cre­ated on its plat­form jump by 71 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter, com­pared with the pre­vi­ous one.</p>
    <p>One of these new e-mer­chants is Mr Tariq Al Bar­wani, cre­ator of Plen­tea, a tea bar in Toronto that re­mained open in March at the start of the lock­down.</p>
    <p>But with only a hand­ful of cus­tomers a day, the sit­u­a­tion quickly be­came un­ten­able, forc­ing him to go out of busi­ness in May.</p>
    <p>In the same month, sup­ported by a mu­nic­i­pal pro­gramme help­ing small busi­nesses af­fected by the cri­sis to go dig­i­tal, he opened a store on Shopify.</p>
    <p>“It took us a week,” he re­called from his liv­ing room, over­look­ing Lake On­tario, where he now works.</p>
    <p>“If you are used to go­ing on the In­ter­net, it is easy to un­der­stand.”</p>
    <p>Shopify has be­come a re­sound­ing suc­cess far from Sil­i­con Val­ley.</p>
    <p>It was co-founded in 2006 by Mr Tobias Lutke, a young Ger­man who had moved to Canada for love and de­signed the soft­ware orig­i­nally to sell snow­boards over the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>Hailed for its sim­plic­ity, it has seen the num­ber of stores on its plat­form grow from 150,000 in 2014 to more than one mil­lion – in 175 coun­tries – last year, as­sert­ing it­self in the eyes of many in­de­pen­dent mer­chants as an al­ter­na­tive to Ama­zon.</p>
    <p>“For re­tail to thrive, it has to be in the hands of the many, not the few,” Mr Finkel­stein said.</p>
    <p>“We need to have as many re­tail­ers, as many brands, as many en­trepreneur­s and small busi­nesses sell­ing, so that we don’t all look the ex­act same, (and) so we don’t buy the ex­act same stuff.”</p>
    <p>‘ARM THE REBELS’</p>
    <p>More bluntly, Mr Lutke, now 40, said on Twit­ter last year: “Ama­zon is try­ing to build an em­pire. Shopify is try­ing to arm the rebels.”</p>
    <p>When they cre­ated their cloth­ing line in 2015, the Toronto-based founders of Kotn, a brand that em­pha­sises trace­abil­ity, went straight to Shopify.</p>
    <p>With C$10,000 (S$10,300) in start-up funds, they could not af­ford to hire an agency.</p>
    <p>And un­like Ama­zon’s mar­ket­place, Shopify al­lowed them to “tell (their) own story” and con­trol their re­la­tion­ship with cus­tomers, said Ms Macken­zie Yeates, one of the co-founders.</p>
    <p>Shopify is also en­joy­ing grow­ing suc­cess with es­tab­lished brands look­ing to side­line in­ter­me­di­aries who sell their wares and build di­rect re­la­tion­ships with cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Pepsi, Unilever and Mon­delez have all opened store­fronts on Shopify in re­cent years. Ketchup maker Heinz and Lindt choco­lates re­cently fol­lowed suit.</p>
    <p>Celebritie­s like Kylie Jen­ner and Vic­to­ria Beck­ham also use it to sell prod­ucts to their fans.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the vol­ume of sales han­dled by the plat­form has in­creased quar­ter af­ter quar­ter.</p>
    <p>In the United States, Shopify mer­chants are now the sec­ond-largest group­ing of on­line mer­chants in the coun­try, be­hind Ama­zon. In­vestors have taken note too. On the Toronto and New York stock ex­changes, Shopify’s share price has tripled since March. With a mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of around C$170 bil­lion in the mid­dle of this month, it has be­come Canada’s most valu­able com­pany.</p>
    <p>Toronto e-com­merce ex­pert Chris Sil­vestre said it is “a fan­tas­tic com­pany” but con­sid­ers its stock over­val­ued, in part be­cause it is still largely un­known how the e-com­merce sec­tor will evolve once the pan­demic has peaked.</p>
    <p>As for Mr Al Bar­wani, his on­line store sales have ex­ceeded ex­pec­ta­tions but still re­main well be­low tak­ings at his for­mer tea bar. While it was easy to launch his site, build­ing new cus­tomers will take time, he con­ceded. Above all, he will have to get used to his new vir­tual life.</p>
    <p>“I do miss my tea bar,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It was nice to see lo­cals come by and say­ing ‘hi’, ask­ing how you’re do­ing... what are you up to this week­end, or how’s your fam­ily do­ing. Those kinds of in­ter­ac­tions are re­ally hard to repli­cate on­line.”</p>
