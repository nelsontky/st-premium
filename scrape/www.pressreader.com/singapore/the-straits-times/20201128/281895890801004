    <p>As the race for a vac­cine nears the fin­ish line, who gets it and whether it should be com­pul­sory are key ques­tions health au­thor­i­ties are grap­pling with.</p>
    <p>Would you take the Covid-19 vac­cine, if it’s avail­able?</p>
    <p>With the an­nounce­ments of three Covid-19 vac­cines achiev­ing ex­cel­lent rates of ef­fec­tive­ness, that is the ques­tion ev­ery­one is ask­ing them­selves.</p>
    <p>The United States’ Food & Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) will meet on Dec 10 to dis­cuss the emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion (EUA) of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vac­cine. If ap­proved, Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion for the high­est risk groups could start in the US be­fore Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>Whether a vac­cine should be used de­pends on sev­eral crit­i­cal fac­tors. Vac­cine ef­fec­tive­ness is the ob­vi­ous first step. How­ever, it must be con­sid­ered to­gether with vac­cine safety.</p>
    <p>Vac­cine safety is ab­so­lutely es­sen­tial when con­sid­er­ing vac­ci­nat­ing mil­lions of peo­ple. So, what should we know about Covid-19 vac­cine safety, and how should we think about it?</p>
    <p>It is use­ful to first ask: “What is safety?” We could start with a dic­tio­nary def­i­ni­tion: “The con­di­tion of be­ing pro­tected from dan­ger, risk, or in­jury.”</p>
    <p>I sug­gest a prag­matic def­i­ni­tion: Safety is find­ing an ac­cept­able bal­ance be­tween risks and ben­e­fits, after do­ing due dili­gence.</p>
    <p>This ap­proach al­lows us to move for­ward, rather than get­ting stuck in anal­y­sis paral­y­sis. After all, we make risk-ben­e­fit de­ci­sions ev­ery time we get in a car, board a plane, or cross the road. We man­age the risks by putting in place sys­tems to en­sure road and air travel is as safe as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>We ac­cept the risks when we get on an air­plane, be­cause the al­ter­na­tive would be a very long jour­ney by road or sea, or not go­ing any­where at all.</p>
    <p>We make sim­i­lar risk-ben­e­fit judg­ments in med­i­cal prac­tice. Vac­cine safety is no dif­fer­ent. Can we give an ab­so­lute guar­an­tee that no one will ever ex­pe­ri­ence any side ef­fects or be harmed by a vac­cine? Ob­vi­ously not. Vac­cines are med­i­ca­tions, and all med­i­ca­tions have risks and side ef­fects, as well as sit­u­a­tions when they should not be used.</p>
    <p>The is­sue of side ef­fects</p>
    <p>So, what side ef­fects should we look for when con­sid­er­ing whether to use a vac­cine?</p>
    <p>There are two cat­e­gories: dan­ger and dis­com­fort. Most of us who have had in­fluenza vac­cines are fa­mil­iar with the dis­com­fort; a sore arm for one to two days, a “fluey” feel­ing of fa­tigue, ach­i­ness and headaches.</p>
    <p>Do vac­cines cause fever? It de­pends on age group and the vac­cine. For the in­fluenza vac­cine, fever can oc­cur in 12 per cent of chil­dren aged one to five, in 5 per cent of those six to 15 years old while in adults, no dif­fer­ence was ob­served com­pared with placebo, or dummy.</p>
    <p>Very rarely, more se­ri­ous events with long-term con­se­quences, even death, can oc­cur after vac­ci­na­tions. This is known and ac­cepted in med­i­cal and pub­lic health prac­tice be­cause the al­ter­na­tive is the dis­abil­ity and death caused by the ac­tual in­fec­tious dis­ease it­self in much larger num­bers and scale.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem for vac­cine pro­grammes is that their very suc­cess breeds com­pla­cency, and a loss of ur­gency for the vac­cine when the dis­ease is no longer seen.</p>
    <p>Among se­ri­ous ad­verse events from vac­cines, yel­low fever vac­ci­na­tion can cause liver or brain in­flam­ma­tion for three out of a mil­lion per­sons vac­ci­nated. The peo­ple who get the yel­low fever vac­cine nowa­days are trav­ellers to</p>
    <p>South Amer­ica and sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa, and pop­u­la­tions in those en­demic coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Yel­low fever sounds like an ex­otic dis­ease, and we may hes­i­tate to vac­ci­nate trav­ellers at higher risk for vac­cine com­pli­ca­tions. But what is rarely ap­pre­ci­ated is that yel­low fever used to be far more widespread and dev­as­tat­ing; the last yel­low fever out­break in the US occurred in 1905 in New Or­leans, and Philadel­phia lost 10 per cent of its en­tire pop­u­la­tion to yel­low fever in the 1793 out­break.</p>
    <p>Yel­low fever is spread by Aedes ae­gypti mos­qui­toes, fa­mil­iar to us as the vec­tor for dengue fever. How­ever, un­like dengue which has a fa­tal­ity rate of 1 in 1,000, yel­low fever still car­ries a fa­tal­ity rate of 20 per cent to 60 per cent among those severely ill.</p>
    <p>So, the safety con­sid­er­a­tions for vac­ci­na­tion must take into ac­count the other side of the equa­tion: What hap­pens with­out vac­ci­na­tion, not just for the in­di­vid­ual, but also for en­tire cities and coun­tries?</p>
    <p>Po­lio, which caused epi­demics leav­ing chil­dren and adults per­ma­nently paral­ysed, was stopped only by vac­ci­na­tion. The Sabin oral po­lio vac­cine con­tains a live, weak­ened virus, which rarely causes vac­cine-as­so­ci­ated par­a­lytic po­lio, at four in a mil­lion. Vac­cine-as­so­ci­ated po­lio hap­pens to 400-500 per­sons per year world­wide, but when com­pared with the 350,000 po­lio cases in 1988 at the start of po­lio erad­i­ca­tion ef­forts, the risk-ben­e­fit clearly favours vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>If a se­ri­ous event oc­curs after some­one gets vac­ci­nated, an­other chal­lenge is to de­ter­mine whether the event is caused by the vac­ci­na­tion, or whether it is a co­in­ci­den­tal oc­cur­rence.</p>
    <p>We have had in­fluenza vac­cines for over seven decades, giv­ing over 150 mil­lion doses per year.</p>
    <p>Yet when me­dia re­ports sur­faced of deaths fol­low­ing flu vac­ci­na­tion in South Korea, vac­ci­na­tion was paused un­til au­top­sies on 46 of the cases pro­vided ev­i­dence that the deaths, mostly among peo­ple in their 70s and 80s, were likely to have been caused by ex­ist­ing med­i­cal con­di­tions, and not the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Events are top-line num­bers, nu­mer­a­tors. We need de­nom­i­na­tors to un­der­stand the true risk. The 50-90 deaths occurred on a de­nom­i­na­tor of 19 mil­lion Kore­ans vac­ci­nated, so we must know the base­line rate of deaths to know if there are grounds for con­cern.</p>
    <p>Risk of un­known un­knowns</p>
    <p>What are the real chal­lenges with</p>
    <p>vac­cine safety for Covid-19 vac­cines? Firstly, both front run­ners for FDA ap­proval, the vac­cines by Pfizer and US biotech com­pany Moderna, use a novel mRNA plat­form which has not been pre­vi­ously used for in­fec­tious dis­ease vac­cines, al­though mRNA vac­cines have been stud­ied as ther­apy for can­cer.</p>
    <p>Other Covid-19 vac­cines em­ploy ade­n­ovirus vec­tors, an­other rel­a­tively new plat­form. All these tech­nolo­gies have al­lowed in­cred­i­bly quick progress, but come with a risk of un­known un­knowns, which is be­ing mon­i­tored.</p>
    <p>Sec­ondly, even with Covid-19 vac­cine tri­als re­cruit­ing over 30,000 par­tic­i­pants, rare risks of vac­cines such as ana­phy­laxis (a se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tion that is po­ten­tially life-threat­en­ing) may not be brought to light.</p>
    <p>In gen­eral, if an event oc­curs with a prob­a­bil­ity of one in 10,000 peo­ple, we need a min­i­mum of 30,000 par­tic­i­pants to de­tect such an event, or have rea­son­able cer­tainty that it has in­deed not occurred.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent Phase 3 re­sults with 15,000-22,000 par­tic­i­pants in the vac­ci­nated groups give only the abil­ity to as­sess the risk of ad­verse events which oc­cur at a prob­a­bil­ity of one in 5,000, to one in 7,000.</p>
    <p>Ana­phy­laxis from in­fluenza vac­cine oc­curs at a rate of 1.3 per mil­lion. We would need to vac­ci­nate more than three mil­lion peo­ple to con­fi­dently de­tect or ex­clude the pres­ence of such a rare ad­verse event. No re­search trial can re­cruit three mil­lion par­tic­i­pants, so such rare events are mon­i­tored after ap­proval by reg­u­la­tory agen­cies like the FDA, or its coun­ter­part in Sin­ga­pore, the Health Sciences Author­ity (HSA).</p>
    <p>As­sum­ing Covid-19 vac­cine car­ries a sim­i­lar risk of ana­phy­laxis, if we were to vac­ci­nate five mil­lion peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore, we could see five to 10 cases of ana­phy­laxis, and we’d have to be pre­pared. Such is the trade-off which ac­com­pa­nies the far greater ben­e­fit of pro­tect­ing us all by vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>As part of due dili­gence for safety in fast-track­ing Covid-19 vac­cine ap­provals, the FDA put in place a two-month wait­ing pe­riod after the sec­ond dose of Covid-19 vac­cine was given, to see if any auto-im­mune or other un­ex­pected side ef­fects de­velop.</p>
    <p>So, when Pfizer filed its EUA ap­pli­ca­tion on Nov 20, it had al­ready com­pleted this wait­ing pe­riod en­forced by the FDA. The full mon­i­tor­ing pe­riod for well-con­ducted vac­cine stud­ies will be at least one to two years.</p>
    <p>All these safe­guards pro­vide fur­ther as­sur­ance of vig­i­lance</p>
    <p>over vac­cine safety.</p>
    <p>The safety con­sid­er­a­tions for vac­ci­na­tion must take into ac­count the other side of the equa­tion: What hap­pens with­out vac­ci­na­tion, not just for the in­di­vid­ual, but for en­tire cities and coun­tries? Po­lio, which caused epi­demics leav­ing chil­dren and adults per­ma­nently paral­ysed, was stopped only by vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>The Sabin oral po­lio vac­cine con­tains a live, weak­ened virus, which rarely causes vac­cine-as­so­ci­ated par­a­lytic po­lio, at four in a mil­lion. Vac­cine-as­so­ci­ated po­lio hap­pens to 400-500 per­sons per year world­wide, but when com­pared with the 350,000 po­lio cases in 1988 at the start of po­lio erad­i­ca­tion ef­forts, the risk-ben­e­fit clearly favours po­lio vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>What should Sin­ga­pore do?</p>
    <p>So, what does this mean for Sin­ga­pore? When Covid-19 vac­cine sup­plies ar­rive, should the health au­thor­i­ties start vac­ci­nat­ing or wait? If you are on the re­ceiv­ing end, should you take the Covid-19 vac­cine, wait, or refuse?</p>
    <p>It could be ar­gued that from the safety stand­point, we should wait and not be the first adopters.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, our com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion rates have fallen to zero or near-zero for some time. This low rate has been achieved as a re­sult of much hard work and ex­panded test­ing, and it bought us some time.</p>
    <p>Other coun­tries face much higher rates of Covid-19 spread. With strained health­care sys­tems and re­newed lock­downs, there is much greater pres­sure to use vac­cines as soon as pos­si­ble, and it makes sense to do so.</p>
    <p>When Covid-19 vac­cines are de­ployed in mil­lions of peo­ple, we should very quickly ac­crue enough data to de­ter­mine rates for even rare vac­ci­na­tion risks.</p>
    <p>But should we wait that long? Vac­cines take time to gen­er­ate pro­tec­tive im­mu­nity, and most of the Covid-19 vac­cines so far are two-dose vac­cines, given over three to four weeks.</p>
    <p>If we are swamped by a Covid-19 sec­ond wave, most of our med­i­cal and pub­lic health re­sources will be con­sumed by pa­tient care, con­tact trac­ing and quar­an­tine. Peo­ple may be hes­i­tant to come for vac­ci­na­tions if there is a risk of get­ting in­fected in crowds wait­ing for their vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Per­haps we should use our cur­rent low-trans­mis­sion breather to get vac­ci­nated, so that we can emerge stronger. More­over, over time, the very tight con­trols wear on us all. We need to enable a cal­i­brated re­turn to eco­nomic and so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>These are not easy de­ci­sions to make, with so much rid­ing on dif­fer­ent con­sid­er­a­tions. But the chal­lenge of how to use Covid-19 vac­cines wisely is a good prob­lem to have, for which we should be thank­ful. With ev­i­dence of 95 per cent efficacy, vac­cines might turn out to be a game changer for this Covid-19 pan­demic, as it has for other in­fec­tious dis­eases.</p>
