    <p>The au­thor­i­ties yes­ter­day urged em­ploy­ers to put in place flex­i­ble work­ing hours for their staff so that more work­ers can com­mute dur­ing off-peak hours.</p>
    <p>Stress­ing the need to have “a good part of work­ers” trav­el­ling af­ter 9.30am, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said: “By do­ing so, we can re­duce the risk of large crowds gath­er­ing in pub­lic trans­port, in pub­lic spa­ces and also in of­fice build­ings.”</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power and its tri­par­tite part­ners are ac­tively look­ing at this is­sue, added Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling the Covid-19 pan­demic here.</p>
    <p>Work­ing from home has been the de­fault ar­range­ment for most com­pa­nies since Sin­ga­pore en­tered its cir­cuit breaker pe­riod on April 7.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the cir­cuit breaker ended on June 1, Mr Wong has said on sev­eral oc­ca­sions that work-from-home ar­range­ments should con­tinue un­less em­ploy­ees have a demon­stra­ble need to re­turn to the work­place, such as to use spe­cialised equip­ment.</p>
    <p>In a press state­ment yes­ter­day, the Min­istry of Health said that as Sin­ga­pore grad­u­ally re­sumes more eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties, many em­ploy­ers have sought guid­ance on ways to al­low more em­ploy­ees to re­turn to the work­place safely, so as to bet­ter sup­port busi­ness op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The min­istry noted in its state­ment that with in­creased in­ter­ac­tions at the work­place, the risk of Covid-19 trans­mis­sion will also in­crease. There­fore, it is crit­i­cal that em­ploy­ers im­ple­ment safe man­age­ment mea­sures se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said: “It is in the in­ter­est of the em­ploy­ers to pro­tect your work­ers against the risk of Covid-19. Oth­er­wise, if a clus­ter is formed at the work­place, it would dis­rupt busi­ness se­verely.”</p>
