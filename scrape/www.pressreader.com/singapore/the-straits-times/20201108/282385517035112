    <p>WHERE 567 Balestier Road</p>
    <p>OPEN Tues­days to Sun­days, noon to 11.30pm; closed on Mon­days</p>
    <p>TEL 9424-0430</p>
    <p>Bet­ter known for chicken rice, bak kut teh, tau sar piah and bud­get ho­tels, Balestier is also home to a highly rated Thai food stall that is un­der the radar.</p>
    <p>Bangkok J. N. Thai Food opened in 2013 in Tan­jong Ka­tong and moved to Cle­menti in 2015.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust last year, it moved to its cur­rent lo­ca­tion at a cof­fee shop in Balestier Road.</p>
    <p>The top dish to try here is the Steamed Lemon Prawn ($13 for small, $20 for large).</p>
    <p>The name is a mis­nomer, as there is no lemon in it. But the dish is ap­petis­ing, with gen­er­ous amounts of kaf­fir lime leaves, tomato, le­mon­grass, salted veg­etable and lime juice. The tangy flavours ac­cen­tu­ate the sweet­ness of the fresh sea prawns.</p>
    <p>Ms Ariya Phot­fueang, 41, is in charge of food prepa­ra­tion and tak­ing or­ders, while her hus­band Piak Phot­fueang, 45, does the cook­ing.</p>
    <p>His style of cook­ing is char­ac­terised by a lib­eral use of in­gre­di­ents and gen­er­ous por­tions. He also uses fresh sea prawns for the Tom Yum Seafood Soup ($7 for small, $14 for medium, $21 for large).</p>
    <p>To cater to his cus­tomers, who are mostly lo­cal, he cooks it at 30 per cent of the level of spici­ness he is used to in Bangkok, where the cou­ple are from.</p>
    <p>The Olive Fried Rice ($5 for small, $8 for medium) could be saltier, but of­fered gen­er­ous amounts of frozen prawns, cab­bage, black olives, squid and fish cake.</p>
    <p>An­other sig­na­ture dish is the BBQ Pork ($10 for small, $15 for medium, $20 for large), known as kor moo yang in Thai. The pork col­lar is sliced and mar­i­nated overnight in a blend of fish sauce, gar­lic, co­rian­der roots, oys­ter sauce and sugar, be­fore it is grilled.</p>
