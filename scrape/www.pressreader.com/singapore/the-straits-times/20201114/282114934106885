    <p>The risks of al­go­rith­mic dis­crim­i­na­tion and bias have re­ceived much at­ten­tion and scru­tiny, and rightly so. Yet there is an­other more in­sid­i­ous side ef­fect of a so­ci­ety in­creas­ingly pow­ered by ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) – the sys­tem­atic in­equal­ity cre­ated by the chang­ing na­ture of work it­self.</p>
    <p>We have long feared a fu­ture where ro­bots take our jobs, but what hap­pens when a sig­nif­i­cant por­tion of the work­force sim­ply ends up in al­go­rith­mi­cally man­aged jobs with lit­tle fu­ture and few pos­si­bil­i­ties for ad­vance­ment?</p>
    <p>One of the clas­sic tropes of self-made suc­cess is the leader who comes from hum­ble be­gin­nings, work­ing his way up from the mail­room, the cash reg­is­ter or the fac­tory floor.</p>
    <p>And while do­ing that is con­sid­er­ably tougher than Hol­ly­wood might sug­gest, bot­tom-up mo­bil­ity has at least been pos­si­ble in tra­di­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions. Mr Charlie Bell, for­mer chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of McDon­ald’s, started out flip­ping burg­ers. Ms Mary Barra, chair­man and CEO of Gen­eral Mo­tors, started on the assem­bly line. Mr Doug McMil­lon, CEO of Wal­mart, started out in a dis­tri­bu­tion centre.</p>
    <p>By way of com­par­i­son, how many Uber driv­ers do you think will ever have the chance to at­tain a man­age­rial po­si­tion at the com­pany, let alone run the ride-shar­ing gi­ant? How many fu­ture top Ama­zon ex­ec­u­tives will start their ca­reers de­liv­er­ing pack­ages or stack­ing shelves?</p>
    <p>THE ‘CODE CEIL­ING’</p>
    <p>Here’s the prob­lem: There’s a “code ceil­ing” that pre­vents ca­reer ad­vance­ment – re­gard­less of gen­der or race – be­cause, in an AI-pow­ered or­gan­i­sa­tion, ju­nior em­ploy­ees and free­lancers rarely in­ter­act with their other hu­man co-work­ers. In­stead, they are man­aged by al­go­rithms.</p>
    <p>In this new era of dig­i­tally me­di­ated work, there is typ­i­cally a hier­ar­chi­cal in­for­ma­tion flow, in which the com­pany de­cides the in­for­ma­tion it chooses to share with you.</p>
    <p>Un­like driv­ing a taxi, where there is open ra­dio com­mu­ni­ca­tion be­tween driv­ers and the dis­patch op­er­a­tor, and among the driv­ers them­selves, when you work for Uber or Lyft, the con­tent of your in­ter­ac­tions is the out­put of an op­ti­mi­sa­tion func­tion de­signed to max­imise ef­fi­ciency and profit.</p>
    <p>To be man­aged al­go­rith­mi­cally is</p>
    <p>to be sub­ject to con­stant mon­i­tor­ing and sur­veil­lance. If you are one of the mil­lions of food de­liv­ery work­ers in China work­ing for Meituan or Ele.me, an al­go­rithm de­ter­mines how long it should take you to drop off an or­der, re­duc­ing your pay if you fail to meet your dead­line.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, em­ploy­ees in Ama­zon dis­tri­bu­tion cen­tres are also care­fully tracked by al­go­rithms; they must work at “Ama­zon pace” – de­scribed as “some­where be­tween walk­ing and jog­ging”.</p>
    <p>When you are a gig econ­omy worker, it is not only your AI bosses that should con­cern you; your co-work­ers are of­ten also your com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, Chicago res­i­dents who live near Ama­zon’s dis­tri­bu­tion points and Whole Foods stores re­ported the strange phe­nom­e­non of see­ing smart­phones hang­ing from trees. The rea­son? Con­tract de­liv­ery driv­ers were des­per­ate to trump their ri­vals for job as­sign­ments. They be­lieved that hang­ing their de­vices near de­liv­ery sta­tions would help them game the work al­lo­ca­tion al­go­rithm.</p>
    <p>A K-SHAPED RE­COV­ERY</p>
    <p>Work has been chang­ing over the last few decades. The labour mar­ket has grown in­creas­ingly po­larised, with mid-level jobs be­ing eroded rel­a­tive to en­try-level, low-skilled work and high-level employment that re­quires greater</p>
    <p>skill lev­els. The Covid-19 cri­sis has likely ac­cel­er­ated the process.</p>
    <p>Since 1990, ev­ery United States re­ces­sion has been fol­lowed by a job­less re­cov­ery. This time, as AI, al­go­rithms and au­to­ma­tion re­shape the work­force, we may end up with some­thing worse: a K-shaped re­cov­ery, where the prospects of those at the top soar, and ev­ery­one else sees his for­tunes dive.</p>
    <p>A global, low-paid, al­go­rith­mic work­force is al­ready emerg­ing. In Latin Amer­ica, one of the fastest-grow­ing start-ups is Rappi, a mix of Uber Eats, In­stacart and TaskRab­bit. Cus­tomers in cities like Bo­gota and Mex­ico City pay about US$1 (S$1.35) an or­der or a flat US$7 a month. In re­turn, they can ac­cess a vast on-de­mand net­work of couri­ers who de­liver food, gro­ceries and just about any­thing else you might want.</p>
    <p>Ama­zon has an in­for­mal net­work of de­liv­ery peo­ple, called Ama­zon Flex, ready to drop pack­ages right to your door – and soon even hand them to you in the street, place them in your car trunk or open the door to your house and store your gro­ceries right in your fridge.</p>
    <p>In his 1930 lec­ture, Eco­nomic Pos­si­bil­i­ties For Our Grand­chil­dren, philoso­pher and econ­o­mist John May­nard Keynes pre­dicted that by around 2030, the pro­duc­tion prob­lem would be solved, and there would be enough of ev­ery­thing for ev­ery­one. The</p>
    <p>catch, how­ever, is that ma­chines would cause tech­no­log­i­cal un­em­ploy­ment. The sce­nario that Keynes didn’t fully an­tic­i­pate was our present case of high tech­no­log­i­cal employment, with an ac­com­pa­ny­ing de­gree of high in­equal­ity.</p>
    <p>The work­force is chang­ing; so too is the work­place. You will in­creas­ingly find a gap be­tween top ex­ec­u­tives and an outer fringe of tran­sient work­ers, even within or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Whether in re­tail or fi­nan­cial ser­vices, lo­gis­tics or man­u­fac­tur­ing, AI-pow­ered or­gan­i­sa­tions are run by a small co­hort of highly paid em­ploy­ees, sup­ported by so­phis­ti­cated au­to­ma­tion and po­ten­tially mil­lions of al­go­rith­mi­cally man­aged, low-paid free­lancers at the pe­riph­ery.</p>
    <p>Job po­lar­i­sa­tion is only part of the prob­lem. What we should re­ally fear is the al­go­rith­mic in­equal­ity trap that re­sults from feed­back loops.</p>
    <p>Once you are a gig econ­omy worker reliant on as­sign­ments meted out by your smart­phone, not only are there few op­por­tu­ni­ties for pro­mo­tion or de­vel­op­ment, but other al­go­rithms may also fur­ther com­pound your si­t­u­a­tion. Think of it as a dig­i­tal poor­house. With their earn­ings and work as­sign­ments held hostage by mar­ket fluc­tu­a­tions, those in the new AI un­der­class may be pe­nalised by</p>
    <p>au­to­mated sys­tems that de­ter­mine ac­cess to wel­fare, lend­ing, in­sur­ance, or health­care, or that set cus­to­dial sen­tences.</p>
    <p>DIS­TRESS SIG­NALS</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, it is dan­ger­ous to seek quick fixes for a prob­lem that has yet to fully man­i­fest, es­pe­cially if it means graft­ing 20th-cen­tury worker pro­tec­tions onto 21st-cen­tury busi­ness mod­els.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, gov­ern­ments and reg­u­la­tors sup­ported by pop­ulist plat­forms are fo­cused on at­tack­ing global dig­i­tal giants. They seek to pre­vent them from avoid­ing tax li­a­bil­i­ties and are work­ing to reg­u­late their free­lance work­force’s labour con­di­tions, to ap­ply re­stric­tions on their col­lec­tion of data, and even to tax their ro­bots.</p>
    <p>Some of th­ese ideas have merit. Oth­ers are pre­ma­ture, or worse, just po­lit­i­cal theatre.</p>
    <p>We need a bet­ter plan for the fu­ture. With­out one, the al­go­rith­mic in­equal­ity trap will be a story told not in sta­tis­tics and wealth ra­tios, but in dis­tress sig­nals – smart­phones hang­ing from trees, tent cities for the home­less and hu­man couri­ers scan­ning the skies for the de­liv­ery drones that spell their im­pend­ing end.</p>
