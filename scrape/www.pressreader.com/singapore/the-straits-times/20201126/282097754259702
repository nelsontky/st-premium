    <p>From the time he was in Pri­mary 3, Muham­mad Saif Mishary Muham­mad Shahidin had been scor­ing Ds and Es in school ex­am­i­na­tions for math­e­mat­ics and science.</p>
    <p>But yes­ter­day, the 12-year-old was elated to see im­prove­ments.</p>
    <p>He re­ceived a C for maths and a B for science, scor­ing 208 over­all at the Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion (PSLE).</p>
    <p>The Sengkang Green Pri­mary pupil was one of 39,995 chil­dren across the is­land who re­ceived their re­sults.</p>
    <p>He is the old­est of three chil­dren. Saif, who had ear­lier se­cured a place in Merid­ian Sec­ondary through the Di­rect School Ad­mis­sion (DSA) scheme in vis­ual art, was pleased with his re­sults. He is el­i­gi­ble for the Ex­press course in the school, he added.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter my ex­ams in P3, I de­cided to work harder to get bet­ter grades. I was wor­ried I would do badly at the PSLE, and I re­alised I must do some­thing to im­prove.”</p>
    <p>In pock­ets of free time af­ter school, he would do his own re­vi­sion, and go on­line to read up on meth­ods to solve math­e­mat­i­cal prob­lems.</p>
    <p>He would check with his teach­ers when he was not clear dur­ing lessons in school.</p>
    <p>He also at­tended pri­vate tu­ition classes for maths.</p>
    <p>“Along the way, I re­alised short­cuts are not the right way in solv­ing chal­lenges...</p>
    <p>“Now I re­alise maths is more fun to do when you know how to do it,” he said.</p>
    <p>Saif is also look­ing for­ward to pur­su­ing his in­ter­est in art.</p>
    <p>When he was in Pri­mary 4, his art teacher stum­bled on a sketch­book he had been us­ing at home.</p>
    <p>“She re­alised I had the po­ten­tial to go to places to broaden my knowl­edge in art, so she helped me ap­ply for the DSA (to Merid­ian Sec­ondary). I’m very thank­ful to her,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I vis­ited the school and I saw that the environmen­t is quite nice and con­ducive to broaden my knowl­edge in art.”</p>
