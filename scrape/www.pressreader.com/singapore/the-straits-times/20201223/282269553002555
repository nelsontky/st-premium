    <p>IN­DUS­TRIAL LAND FOR SALE IN FIRST HALF OF NEXT YEAR, DOWN FROM 4.4HA IN THE PRE­CED­ING SIX MONTHS</p>
    <p>There will be 3.86ha of in­dus­trial land for sale for the first half of next year, a drop from the 4.4ha in the pre­ced­ing six months.</p>
    <p>There are three sites in the con­firmed list and three in the re­serve list un­der the In­dus­trial Gov­ern­ment Land Sales (IGLS) pro­gramme, said the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The same num­ber of con­firmed and re­served list sites were of­fered in the sec­ond half of this year.</p>
    <p>The 4.4ha in site area for that pe­riod was it­self a drop from the first half of the year’s 7.11ha, which com­prised three sites in the con­firmed list and five sites in the re­serve list.</p>
    <p>In this lat­est launch, the three con­firmed list sites are zoned B2 for heav­ier in­dus­trial use for a ten­ure of 20 years. They are lo­cated in Tampines North Drive 5, Gul Av­enue and Jalan Pa­pan.</p>
    <p>The three re­serve list sites are also zoned B2.</p>
    <p>Two sites have a ten­ure of 30 years. They are in Wood­lands In­dus­trial Park and Tampines North Drive 5. The re­main­ing site in Jalan Pa­pan has a ten­ure of 20 years.</p>
    <p>Con­firmed list sites are launched ac­cord­ing to sched­ule re­gard­less of de­mand, while re­serve list land is put up for ten­der when a de­vel­oper makes an of­fer ac­cept­able to the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>JTC will be the sales agent for all the sites.</p>
    <p>MTI said: “The Gov­ern­ment will con­tinue to re­lease suf­fi­cient land through the IGLS pro­gramme to en­sure an ad­e­quate sup­ply of in­dus­trial space in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
