    <p>• When then Ger­man Chan­cel­lor Ger­hard Schroeder in 2003 de­clined to pledge al­le­giance to the United States and re­fused to send troops to Iraq, ties be­tween the two coun­tries hit a new low.</p>
    <p>Say­ing no to the de­mands of the US, then un­der the pres­i­dency of Mr Ge­orge W. Bush, was a first for post-war Ger­many.</p>
    <p>Mr Schroeder’s re­fusal to be at Amer­ica’s beck and call was sig­nif­i­cant in that Ger­many, re­spon­si­ble for so much of the dev­as­ta­tion of World War II, was helped back on its feet by Amer­i­can money, ed­u­ca­tion and an in­cred­i­ble amount of good­will.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the Cold War, the US was the guar­an­tor of the West­ern part of the di­vided coun­try against the Soviet threat. The price tag? Un­wa­ver­ing loy­alty to the US in the knowl­edge that Ger­many, bristling with Amer­i­can nu­clear mis­siles, would be the deadly bat­tle­ground in case of a new war.</p>
    <p>When Chan­cel­lor Schroeder baulked at Pres­i­dent Bush’s ex­pec­ta­tion of Ger­many send­ing troops to bol­ster his war in Iraq, the US then was still feeling in­vin­ci­ble af­ter win­ning the Cold War. Ger­many, how­ever, was still aching un­der the strain of a costly re­uni­fi­ca­tion and ex­tremely wary of join­ing the US in an­other the­atre of war af­ter hav­ing con­tributed troops to the US-led coali­tion in Afghanista­n the year be­fore.</p>
    <p>Fast for­ward to the present – the US-Ger­man re­la­tion­ship is now far more bal­anced.</p>
    <p>Yes, Ber­lin and Wash­ing­ton are hag­gling over an ar­ray of mat­ters – ex­port du­ties, en­vi­ron­men­tal stan­dards, trade im­bal­ances and po­lit­i­cal is­sues. They are fight­ing over de­fence con­tri­bu­tions and the right path on how to ap­proach an au­to­cratic Rus­sia and an in­creas­ingly pushy China. But that’s what nor­mal coun­tries do – dif­fer­ences are par for the course in any re­la­tion­ship be­tween equals, es­pe­cially in tu­mul­tuous times.</p>
    <p>This is the con­text in which we should view the re­cent fric­tion be­tween US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and Ger­man Chan­cel­lor</p>
    <p>An­gela Merkel. Each is a na­tional leader de­fend­ing na­tional in­ter­ests, much as it was be­tween Mr Schroeder and Mr Bush 17 years ago. While their per­son­al­i­ties may clash, the is­sues that di­vide the US and Ger­many pre­date Chan­cel­lor Merkel and Pres­i­dent Trump and will be around long af­ter both have left the po­lit­i­cal stage.</p>
    <p>And the same could be said for Mr Trump’s dif­fi­cul­ties with</p>
    <p>French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron and many other heads of state as well.</p>
    <p>Seen through a wider lens, the cur­rent dif­fi­cul­ties be­tween Ger­many and the US have to do with geopo­lit­i­cal repo­si­tion­ing.</p>
    <p>Ger­many has come of age. The front lines have moved away from the Cold War era’s Iron Cur­tain to other places and the US has aban­doned its role as world po­lice­man. In these changed cir­cum­stances, Ger­many is no longer a pushover while the US un­der its cur­rent er­ratic lead­er­ship has lost con­sid­er­able at­trac­tion and lever­age.</p>
    <p>It’s high time the terms of the re­la­tion­ship changed, a process in which Mr Trump only func­tioned as a cat­a­lyst. It is a good thing, too, as a re­la­tion­ship built on nos­tal­gia, as po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst Ge­orge Fried­man put it, will not last. But it was mostly nos­tal­gia that glued Ger­many and the US to­gether af­ter the Ber­lin Wall came crash­ing down on Nov 9, 1989.</p>
    <p>The bonds were re­in­forced when the US stood by Ger­many in the face of op­po­si­tion to the coun­try’s re­uni­fi­ca­tion from Bri­tain’s Mrs Mar­garet Thatcher and French leader Fran­cois Mit­ter­rand.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the es­trange­ment that fol­lowed was per­haps in­evitable af­ter the com­mon threat, the Soviet Union and War­saw Pact, had evap­o­rated.</p>
    <p>Now, it is Ger­many and France that are shap­ing the new Euro­pean land­scape, with Brexit Bri­tain in­creas­ingly a naysayer or by­stander. At the same time, the transat­lantic re­la­tion­ship has lost much of its pre­vi­ous al­lure, where once its strength was the yard­stick tele­vised en­trepreneur­s’ sum­mit with Mr Xi. The close­ness of the re­la­tion­ship has made it a sore point for some in the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>White House trade ad­viser Peter Navarro has at­tacked the idea of Mi­crosoft buy­ing TikTok and raised ques­tions about how the US group man­aged to keep its search en­gine Bing alive on the Chi­nese In­ter­net, say­ing: “We know that there’s some fishy stuff go­ing on there.”</p>
    <p>As well as Bing, which is the only for­eign search en­gine con­sis­tently avail­able in China, and which cen­sors Chi­nese search re­sults but says this is lim­ited to users in the main­land, Mi­crosoft owns two of the three ma­jor un­blocked for­eign plat­forms con­tain­ing user-gen­er­ated con­tent. These are LinkedIn, the pro­fes­sional net­work­ing web­site, and GitHub, a code-shar­ing site for devel­op­ers. The third is the re­views sys­tem of Ama­zon’s web­site.</p>
    <p>Rank­ing Dig­i­tal Rights direc­tor Re­becca MacK­in­non said</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft had taken down its blog­ging plat­form af­ter be­ing by which all po­lit­i­cal ac­tions in Ger­many were mea­sured against.</p>
    <p>This is not to deny the pain of cut­ting the cord. Given the strength of the emo­tional bond, Ger­mans can­not but feel a sense of loss and be­wil­der­ment over the aban­don­ment by a once trusted ally, now given over to in­ter­nal ri­ot­ing, out­right pop­ulism and out­right hos­til­ity from a bully of a pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Whether it is on Huawei and 5G, on im­port­ing more gas from Rus­sia or how to ap­proach Chi­nese ex­pan­sion­ism, 75 years af­ter the end of World War II, those thorny ques­tions in the US-Ger­man re­la­tion­ship should not be dis­cussed in terms of moral debt or un­re­quited af­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>In the 21st cen­tury, Ger­many is a sov­er­eign state tak­ing its own decisions that are in the coun­try’s and, hope­fully Europe’s, best in­ter­est. The US un­der Mr Trump, which has adopted a much more self­ish “Amer­ica First” pol­icy, should at least re­spect this style of gov­ern­ing from a long-time ally. crit­i­cised in 2005 for re­mov­ing the blog of a Chi­nese jour­nal­ist. She added that it also “didn’t roll out a Chi­nese ver­sion of Out­look, its e-mail ser­vice. They’ve avoided that de­lib­er­ately”.</p>
    <p>Ms MacK­in­non said the com­pany was strict in its ge­o­graphic ringfenc­ing of data be­cause of Euro­pean Union reg­u­la­tory at­ten­tion, and was un­likely to let Chi­nese gov­ern­ment re­quests pose a threat to US data. As for its China op­er­a­tions, “they are mak­ing more ef­fort to min­imise the risks for Chi­nese users. A Chi­nese com­pany has fewer op­tions”.</p>
    <p>Pro­tect­ing users from Bei­jing will be trick­ier now with the pass­ing of Hong Kong’s na­tional se­cu­rity law, which gives the re­gion’s au­thor­i­ties broad pow­ers to surveil po­lit­i­cal dis­si­dents. Last month, Mi­crosoft said it would pause re­spond­ing to the Hong Kong au­thor­i­ties’ data re­quests.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft’s re­search in China, ar­guably its strong­est as­set over the past two decades, has also in­cluded col­lab­o­ra­tions with re­searchers at China’s mil­i­tary-con­trolled</p>
    <p>The US did what it could to turn Ger­many into a self-con­fi­dent mem­ber of the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity – and it worked. Now it should not com­plain about it.</p>
    <p>Ber­lin will sur­vive an Amer­i­can troop with­drawal of an al­ready di­min­ished de­ploy­ment that mainly hurts US in­ter­ests. Ger­many, too, will deal with the ex­pected pres­sure on Huawei, Iran and what­ever new ar­eas of dis­agree­ment that sur­face in the fu­ture in its deal­ings with Amer­ica. Ger­man com­pa­nies may have to pay a price for this, but they will be smart enough to find ways out of the predica­ment.</p>
    <p>For the US, it should be an as­set hav­ing an ally in Europe strong enough to be a sta­bil­is­ing fac­tor in a shift­ing geopo­lit­i­cal world. If the cur­rent Pres­i­dent does not share this view, so be it. It might even help Ger­many to has­ten its shift to­wards a new, more in­de­pen­dent role – and out of the com­fort zone it en­joyed for so long.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity of De­fence Tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s man­age­ment of its re­search staff is very light. Lim­it­ing re­search col­lab­o­ra­tions is “a re­ally tough ques­tion – re­search is a very lib­eral en­vi­ron­ment in it­self”, said a sec­ond for­mer Mi­crosoft China ex­ec­u­tive. “Peo­ple might ques­tion (re­search col­lab­o­ra­tions) but from the point of view of our re­searchers, they want to work with the best part­ners they can find in their field,” the ex­ec­u­tive added.</p>
    <p>But although Mi­crosoft has a strong po­si­tion in China – about 90 per cent of the per­sonal com­put­ers in the coun­try use the Mi­crosoft Win­dows op­er­at­ing sys­tem, and un­til re­cently many gov­ern­ment web­sites ran cor­rectly only on the In­ter­net Ex­plorer browser – it has not ben­e­fited much fi­nan­cially. A long bat­tle against soft­ware piracy, which has in­volved many years of del­i­cate diplo­macy with Chi­nese law en­forcers, has yielded only mi­nor vic­to­ries.</p>
    <p>“It’s not hard to find Mi­crosoft soft­ware in China and even in Chi­nese gov­ern­ment in­sti­tu­tions. It’s a lot harder to find Mi­crosoft soft­ware that Mi­crosoft has been paid for,” Mi­crosoft pres­i­dent Brad Smith said ear­lier this year. He put the scale of Mi­crosoft’s China busi­ness at only 1.8 per cent of its global rev­enue.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft’s global shift of fo­cus to its Azure cloud ser­vices has also faced dif­fi­cul­ties in China, where the cloud sec­tor has high bar­ri­ers to en­try for for­eign play­ers. Although some ex­ec­u­tives wanted to pull the loss-mak­ing cloud divi­sion out of China, chief ex­ec­u­tive Satya</p>
    <p>Nadella ve­toed the de­ci­sion, ac­cord­ing to a Mi­crosoft con­sul­tant.</p>
    <p>“China has a mem­ory like an ele­phant: Once you pull out, it’s very dif­fi­cult to get back in,” the con­sul­tant said. Mi­crosoft de­clined to com­ment on the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, Mi­crosoft is keen to main­tain both its re­search base in the world’s sec­ond tech­nol­ogy su­per­power and to con­tinue to cul­ti­vate the good re­la­tion­ships that, in part, brought TikTok to the ne­go­ti­a­tion ta­ble.</p>
    <p>In De­cem­ber Mi­crosoft launched its China Alumni Net­work, with a WeChat post ti­tled Once A Mi­crosoftie, Al­ways A Mi­crosoftie!</p>
    <p>“Mi­crosoft’s alumni can be pos­i­tive am­bas­sadors and mes­sen­gers to the China-US re­la­tion­ship,” said Chi­nese search group Baidu pres­i­dent Zhang Yaqin.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond for­mer Mi­crosoft China ex­ec­u­tive added: “The soft power of Mi­crosoft in China is im­mense. For the most part, Chi­nese em­ploy­ees leav­ing have a soft spot for Mi­crosoft.”</p>
    <p>But the com­pany will have to tread care­fully with ByteDance, avoid giv­ing the im­pres­sion that it is tak­ing ad­van­tage of a forced sale, and po­ten­tially even of­fer to sell some of its China as­sets in re­turn, ac­cord­ing to two sources.</p>
    <p>So far it has faced lit­tle anger from Bei­jing or from Chi­nese na­tion­al­ists at its mooted deal. “The pre­vail­ing view is the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment won’t re­tal­i­ate as much as they did over Huawei,” said Rui Ma, author of a forth­com­ing book on ByteDance.</p>
    <p>How long Mi­crosoft can nav­i­gate the grow­ing po­lit­i­cal divi­sion – and whether it can main­tain and even­tu­ally profit more from its tech­nol­ogy base in China – is an­other mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Gates and Mr Nadella have a “global mind­set”, ac­cord­ing to the for­mer Mi­crosoft China ex­ec­u­tive. But he added that it has been “se­verely tested by the cur­rent pol­i­tics of the US” and that bosses in Red­mond may be won­der­ing what their long-term strat­egy for China is.</p>
    <p>An­other for­mer Mi­crosoft China ex­ec­u­tive said the com­pany’s good re­la­tion­ships “are not go­ing to change the fu­ture of China”, which is bent on swop­ping for­eign tech­nol­ogy for do­mes­tic al­ter­na­tives.</p>
