    <p>HE SINGS, HE ACTS, HE COOKS:</p>
    <p>Hong Kong star Ni­cholas Tse has made a ca­reer out of singing and act­ing and has won no­tice in re­cent years for one other tal­ent: cook­ing.</p>
    <p>This week, the 40-year-old once again re­ceived a nod for his culi­nary skills: On Wed­nes­day, he was named a Friend of Miche­lin by the world-fa­mous food guide, ac­cord­ing to Chi­nese me­dia re­ports.</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, Tse has ven­tured into the culi­nary world with his food trav­el­ogue se­ries Chef Nic (2014 to present). In 2016, he was the first per­son to be given the Friend of Miche­lin ti­tle for his pos­i­tive con­tri­bu­tions to the culi­nary scene de­spite not be­ing a pro­fes­sional chef with his own restau­rant.</p>
    <p>For his lat­est ac­co­lade, Tse thanked Miche­lin on the Chi­nese so­cial me­dia plat­form Weibo and shared pic­tures of his culi­nary cre­ations at a Miche­lin event in Shang­hai on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>He wrote of the dishes he show­cased at the event: “Tried some­thing new with tra­di­tional food.</p>
    <p>“Broke down the spicy el­e­ments of the Hu­nan-style steamed fish with diced pep­pers; the scales of the fish stand up after they are driz­zled with hot oil – the crispy scales and the burst­ing flavours of the fish roe make for a lay­ered dish with lots of oomph.”</p>
    <p>He also made a Chi­nese sta­ple – hot oil noo­dles (above) – with brightly coloured herbs and veg­eta­bles sprin­kled on it.</p>
    <p>He wrote: “Hope­fully such new in­no­va­tions will at­tract more cus­tomers from the West and more young peo­ple to Chi­nese cui­sine. Our food is re­ally amaz­ing and has in­cred­i­ble po­ten­tial.”</p>
