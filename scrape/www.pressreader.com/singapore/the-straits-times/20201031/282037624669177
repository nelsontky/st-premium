    <p>In Fe­bru­ary, when Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump vis­ited In­dia, Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi was ef­fu­sive in his praise for the United States leader at a mas­sive rally in Gu­jarat, the home state of the In­dian PM.</p>
    <p>He said ties were “far greater and closer”, and praised Mr Trump as a leader “who thinks big”.</p>
    <p>The ca­ma­raderie be­tween the two men in­di­cated the com­fort level in the re­la­tion­ship be­tween the two sides, some­thing with rare bi­par­ti­san sup­port in the US where Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den is also a pro­po­nent of close ties with New Delhi.</p>
    <p>There is a sense here, there­fore, that In­dia has man­aged to suc­cess­fully nav­i­gate the choppy wa­ters of po­lit­i­cal Wash­ing­ton, where an ad­min­is­tra­tion led by an un­pre­dictable and volatile pres­i­dent has even taken aim at close al­lies.</p>
    <p>“I think this is a sim­ple mat­ter, by and large, of how In­dia has ad­justed now to Mr Trump. Any change in govern­ment will be a bit desta­bil­is­ing in the short term,” said Pro­fes­sor Harsh V. Pant, di­rec­tor of stud­ies at the Ob­server Re­search Foun­da­tion in New Delhi.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think there is any par­tic­u­lar pro­cliv­ity for Mr Trump. I think it’s a ques­tion that he has been man­aged well by In­dia. There is a level of con­fi­dence that if he is re­elected, he can be man­aged.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s tough rhetoric against Pak­istan and China has been of par­tic­u­lar com­fort to In­dia, which has a trou­bled re­la­tion­ship with both.</p>
    <p>In­dia has thrown off all hes­i­ta­tion in closely align­ing with the US, a shift fur­ther so­lid­i­fied by the worst bor­der clashes in more than</p>
    <p>four decades with China in June.</p>
    <p>This shift was also ap­par­ent in the de­ci­sion to in­vite Aus­tralia – af­ter years of hes­i­ta­tion – to join the Mal­abar naval ex­er­cises, in­volv­ing Ja­pan and the US. All four coun­tries are mem­bers of the Quadri­lat­eral Se­cu­rity Di­a­logue, an in­for­mal se­cu­rity fo­rum seen by China as an ad­ver­sar­ial group­ing.</p>
    <p>Still, there are con­tentious is­sues be­tween In­dia and the US which in­clude trade as well as Mr Trump’s de­ci­sion to tighten the visa pro­gramme for highly skilled work­ers, used mostly by In­dian soft­ware com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>In­dian an­a­lysts do not fore­see a Bi­den pres­i­dency al­ter­ing the up­ward tra­jec­tory of close ties, given the con­ver­gence of in­ter­ests over China.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den is ex­pected to be more le­nient on im­mi­gra­tion. New Delhi, how­ever, will be wary of him fo­cus­ing on In­dia’s in­ter­nal devel­op­ments, in­clud­ing hu­man rights and Kash­mir, an area largely ig­nored by Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>By and large, South Asia is ex­pect­ing con­ti­nu­ity, an­a­lysts said.</p>
    <p>I don’t think there is any par­tic­u­lar pro­cliv­ity for Mr Trump. I think it’s a ques­tion that he has been man­aged well by In­dia. There is a level of con­fi­dence that if he is re-elected, he can be man­aged.</p>
