    <p>As I watched the first Trump-Bi­den pres­i­den­tial de­bate, a vi­sion popped into my head.</p>
    <p>I imag­ined that the Polit­buro of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party had also gath­ered to watch the de­bate – but its mem­bers de­cided to make it more en­ter­tain­ing by play­ing a drink­ing game.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery time Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said some­thing ridicu­lous or em­bar­rass­ing for Amer­ica, each Polit­buro mem­ber had to down a shot of whiskey.</p>
    <p>Within half an hour, all 25 mem­bers were stone-cold drunk. How could they not have been? They were watch­ing some­thing they had never seen be­fore – the out-of-con­trol an­tics of an in­co­her­ent Amer­i­can pres­i­dent, a man clearly des­per­ate to stay in of­fice be­cause los­ing could mean his pros­e­cu­tion, hu­mil­i­a­tion and liq­ui­da­tion all at the same time.</p>
    <p>And who can blame the Chi­nese for gloat­ing? A pan­demic that be­gan in Wuhan and, for now, has been con­tained in China, is still ram­pag­ing through the US econ­omy and cit­i­zenry – even though it saw the whole thing com­ing. Alas, Amer­ica is not what it thinks it is. Covid-19 was sup­posed to be China’s Ch­er­nobyl. It has ended up look­ing more like the West’s Water­loo.</p>
    <p>That is the ar­gu­ment made by John Mick­leth­wait and Adrian Wooldridge in their new book, The Wake-Up Call: Why The Pan­demic Has Ex­posed The Weak­ness Of The West, And How To Fix It.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Johns Hop­kins coro­n­avirus tracker, Amer­ica has suf­fered 65.74 Covid-19 deaths per 100,000 peo­ple, or about 216,000 in to­tal. China has lost 0.34 per 100,000, or about 4,750 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Maybe China’s fib­bing. OK, so quadru­ple its numbers – China still has been vastly bet­ter at pro­tect­ing its peo­ple than the United States.</p>
    <p>In­deed, early this month, days after Mr Trump’s White House be­came a su­per-spreader site and mil­lions of Amer­i­cans were afraid to send their kids to school, China, with close to zero lo­cal trans­mis­sions, saw mil­lions of its cit­i­zens flock­ing to bus and train sta­tions as well as air­ports to travel all across their coun­try for a na­tional hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>On Oct 1, Bloomberg re­ported: “The Chi­nese yuan is draw­ing at­ten­tion as a haven from volatil­ity after its best quar­ter in 12 years.” China’s Septem­ber im­ports and ex­ports both surged. That used to be the case for Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>“We ar­gue that the high point for West­ern gov­ern­ment, at least com­par­a­tively, was the 1960s when Amer­ica was rac­ing to put a man on the moon and mil­lions of Chi­nese were dy­ing of star­va­tion,” Mr Mick­leth­wait, ed­i­tor-in-chief of Bloomberg News, told me.</p>
    <p>Also, “that was the last time when three-quar­ters of Amer­i­cans trusted their gov­ern­ment”.</p>
    <p>But, said Mr Wooldridge, po­lit­i­cal ed­i­tor of The Econ­o­mist, to­day we’re head­ing to­wards “the full re­ver­sal of the his­tory that be­gan 500 years ago when China was equally far ahead – a quar­ter of the world’s econ­omy and by far the most so­phis­ti­cated gov­ern­ment. We for­get these things. China does not. This could be a cru­cial year in terms of Asia re­gain­ing the lead it had 500 years ago – un­less the West wakes up”.</p>
    <p>For the US to bounce back would re­quire, for starters, a na­tional plan to deal with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>China had one: It de­ployed all the tools of its au­thor­i­tar­ian sur­veil­lance sys­tem – tools de­signed to track and trace po­lit­i­cal dis­si­dents and to con­trol the pop­u­la­tion – to track and trace those in­fected with the coro­n­avirus and con­trol its spread.</p>
    <p>Some of China’s fa­cial recog­ni­tion tech­nol­ogy is so good, you do not even have to take off your face mask. Your eyes and up­per nose will do.</p>
    <p>Amer­ica can­not em­ploy such a strat­egy. It does not have an au­thor­i­tar­ian gov­ern­ment (yet), and I sure do not want one. But it failed to pro­duce a demo­cratic con­sen­sus to do the same job.</p>
    <p>That is what is so de­press­ing. Amer­ica has con­fronted au­thor­i­tar­ian states in its re­cent his­tory – Ja­pan and Ger­many in World War II and North Korea and Rus­sia dur­ing the Cold War.</p>
    <p>Au­thor­i­tar­ian regimes al­ways have an ad­van­tage at the start of wars: They can just or­der their so­ci­eties to do things from the top down. But in the long run, Amer­ica al­ways tri­umphed be­cause, while it is usu­ally un­pre­pared for war and starts slowly, it al­ways climbs the learn­ing curve fast and comes to­gether for the long haul – from the bot­tom up.</p>
    <p>Un­til now. This time, it never pulled to­gether to rise to the Covid-19 chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>UNIQUELY IN­DI­VID­U­AL­IS­TIC AMER­I­CANS</p>
    <p>On March 28, Mr Trump de­clared: “Our coun­try is at war with an in­vis­i­ble en­emy.” He vowed to sum­mon “the full power of the Amer­i­can nation” to de­feat it.</p>
    <p>But it never hap­pened. Out­side of the first re­spon­ders and health work­ers, acts of pub­lic sol­i­dar­ity and wartime will­ing­ness to sac­ri­fice have been min­i­mal or evanes­cent. Why?</p>
    <p>It is not be­cause democ­ra­cies are in­ca­pable of gov­ern­ing in a pan­demic – South Korea, Ja­pan, Tai­wan and New Zealand have done much bet­ter than the US.</p>
    <p>In part, it is be­cause Amer­i­cans have a uniquely in­di­vid­u­al­is­tic cul­ture, a highly frag­mented lo­cal-state-fed­eral power-shar­ing sys­tem, a frail pub­lic health sys­tem, a di­vided body politic, a Repub­li­can Party whose busi­ness model has long been to crip­ple Wash­ing­ton, and so many peo­ple get­ting their news from so­cial net­works that am­plify con­spir­acy the­o­ries and de­stroy truth and trust.</p>
    <p>But what is most dif­fer­ent is that Amer­i­cans now have a Pres­i­dent whose po­lit­i­cal strat­egy for re-elec­tion is to di­vide them, to de­stroy trust – and to de­stroy truth – and to de­clare any news hos­tile to his goals as “fake”.</p>
    <p>And with­out truth and trust in a pan­demic, you are lost. In the last great pan­demic, in 1918, lots of Amer­i­cans did not mind wear­ing masks – look at the pic­tures – be­cause their lead­ers asked them to do so and led by ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>But this time, the Pres­i­dent never trusted Amer­i­cans with the truth and led by dis­miss­ing the virus and mock­ing mask-wear­ing. So, many Amer­i­cans never trusted him back.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, they could never ra­tio­nally dis­cuss the sorts of trade-offs that a democ­racy like theirs, with a cul­ture likes theirs, needed to make.</p>
    <p>TO­TAL HARM MIN­IMI­SA­TION STRAT­EGY</p>
    <p>Pub­lic health ex­pert David Katz ar­gued in a New York Times op-ed and in an in­ter­view with me back in March that Amer­i­cans needed a na­tional plan that bal­anced sav­ing the most lives and the most liveli­hoods – at the same time.</p>
    <p>If they just fo­cused on sav­ing ev­ery life, they would cre­ate mil­lions of deaths of de­spair from lost jobs, sav­ings and busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>If they just fo­cused on sav­ing ev­ery job, they would cru­elly con­demn to death fel­low Amer­i­cans who de­served no such fate. Dr Katz ar­gued for a strat­egy of “to­tal harm min­imi­sa­tion” that would have pro­tected the el­derly and most vul­ner­a­ble, while grad­u­ally feed­ing back into the work­force the young and healthy most likely to ex­pe­ri­ence the coro­n­avirus ei­ther asymp­tomat­i­cally or mildly – and let them keep the econ­omy hum­ming and build up some nat­u­ral herd im­mu­nity as the coun­try awaited a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, Amer­i­cans could never have a sane, sober dis­cus­sion about such a strat­egy.</p>
    <p>From the right, Dr Katz said, they got “con­temp­tu­ous dis­dain” for do­ing even the sim­plest things, such as wear­ing a mask and so­cial dis­tanc­ing. The left was much more re­spon­si­ble, he added, but not im­mune from treat­ing any dis­cus­sion of eco­nomic trade-offs in a pan­demic as im­moral and “treat­ing any pol­icy al­low­ing for any death as an act of so­ciopa­thy”.</p>
    <p>In sum, what ails the US to­day is some­thing that can­not be cured by a Covid-19 vac­cine. Amer­i­cans have lost the trust in each other and in their in­sti­tu­tions and a ba­sic sense of what is true – all nec­es­sary to nav­i­gate a health cri­sis to­gether. They had them in pre­vi­ous wars, but not to­day’s.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve that Mr Joe Bi­den was nom­i­nated by Democrats, and has a real chance to win, be­cause enough Amer­i­cans in­tuit that they are sick with dis­unity and that the former vice-pres­i­dent might be able to be­gin to re­verse it.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s vic­tory will not be suf­fi­cient to make Amer­ica healthy again – po­lit­i­cally and phys­i­cally – but it is nec­es­sary. Mean­while, Rus­sia and China, please do not in­vade Amer­ica right now.</p>
    <p>Amer­ica is not what it used to be.</p>
