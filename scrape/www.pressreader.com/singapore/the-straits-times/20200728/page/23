6319-5488 stnewsdesk@sph.com.sg Business: Photo: Home: Sport: Art: number of dengue cases up because of reduced maintenanc­e work Arts companies need permanent homes to grow Dengue’s impact goes beyond number of patients hospitalis­ed Have cabbies, private-hire drivers roll down windows It is disconcert­ing to read that three establishe­d arts companies, namely, The Necessary Stage, Intercultu­ral Theatre Institute and The Substation, have to move out of their premises to make way for redevelopm­ent (Arts institutio­ns pressed for space, July 21).
The issue of arts housing has been a persistent one, given the lack of space in Singapore.
But I view this as part of a larger conundrum that goes beyond just physical space or funding. It has to do with our attitude towards independen­t arts spaces, which are a vital part of our arts ecosystem.
Independen­t arts spaces (although not entirely independen­t as they still depend on the National Arts Council for funding) are important incubation and experiment­al spaces where young and emerging artists are nurtured, ideas are formed, tested and developed, and cutting-edge works are exhibited.
Our aspiration to become a global city of the arts has unfortunat­ely come at the expense of many independen­t arts spaces over the years. On the one hand, we have done well to build world-class arts infrastruc­ture such as the Esplanade and National Gallery Singapore, which are among the best in Asia.
On the other hand, we have not been doing enough to help sustain independen­t arts spaces, which usually means they go under whenever funding is cut or when they have to look for new, invariably more expensive homes.
For the arts to thrive here, it is important for arts companies to have a permanent home so as to build a unique identity and a sense of rootedness in the community.
We do not see the same extent of displaceme­nt of arts spaces in other countries. Some of them have been in the same location for decades or even centuries.
How we value these ground-up, independen­t arts spaces ultimately reflects how we value the arts.
These spaces can add much-needed vibrancy to our local arts scene and complement our national institutio­ns. The Ministry of Health’s director of medical services Kenneth Mak has said the increase in dengue cases in recent months is still manageable (Spike in dengue cases has not overburden­ed health system, July 25).
This surge in cases has affected not only individual­s, but also the community, the primary healthcare and public health systems and, potentiall­y, our economy.
A record 1,733 dengue cases were reported two weeks ago. It was also the sixth consecutiv­e week that the weekly number of reported dengue cases exceeded 1,000. The number of active dengue clusters also continues to rise.
Such massive increases in cases and active clusters impose a significan­t burden on our public health system as well as the primary healthcare system.
Doctors at outpatient clinics have to deal with the current double crisis of Covid-19 and dengue.
The responsibi­lity upon their shoulders is heavy as they face the challengin­g task of having to diagnose and manage patients infected with Covid-19 and/or dengue.
While dengue is often a mild disease, it may potentiall­y be fatal, even to healthy young individual­s. In patients who have recovered from dengue, the sequelae of dengue may be sufficient­ly disabling to lead to loss of work and productivi­ty.
At the national level, this disease burden on individual­s may be translated into a burden upon the economy.
It may not often be the case that dengue patients require hospitalis­ation or admission into intensive care units. But it would be dangerous to underestim­ate the impact of dengue on the community and healthcare system based on inpatient care alone.
Effective vector control, prevention, clinical diagnosis and management of the disease, as well as community education and engagement, are fundamenta­l and pressing considerat­ions for Singapore.
Let us work towards effective measures to curb the menace of dengue. I refer to recent letters to the Forum page by readers and the Land Transport Authority (LTA).
I would like to suggest that the LTA direct that cabbies and private-hire drivers wind down their windows, if not fully then at least partially, to allow more air circulatio­n for the safety of both drivers and passengers amid the coronaviru­s pandemic.
I recall that this was a rule in place during the Sars (severe acute respirator­y syndrome) outbreak in 2003.
I wonder why it is not in place in the current pandemic.
Health experts have been advocating that being in an open space is safer than being in a enclosed one, while the LTA has advised cabbies and private-hire drivers not to accept passengers who do not don masks.
With demand for cabs and private-hire cars having fallen much, if the drivers start being choosy about whom they pick up, they may have to drive around for even longer periods in an enclosed space in order to get business. For the arts to thrive here, it is important for arts companies to have a permanent home so as to build a unique identity and a sense of rootedness in the community. We do not see the same extent of displaceme­nt of arts spaces in other countries. Some of them have been in the same location for decades or even centuries. Ho Ting Fei (Dr) It may not often be the case that dengue patients require hospitalis­ation or admission into intensive care units. But it would be dangerous to underestim­ate the impact of dengue on the community and healthcare system based on inpatient care alone. Jeffrey Say Seck Leong Look into cost of primary school canteen food Tan Saw Bin I feel that the cost of primary school canteen food is a contributi­ng factor to the high cost of living for families.
For example, homemade pancake costs $1.20 a piece, while roti prata costs $1 and homemade pizza costs $1.50.
A small bowl of instant noodles with a fishball and a few pieces of fish cake costs at least $1.50.
A plate of white rice with chicken and cabbage costs between $1.60 and $2.
The serving sizes are small. When my daughter was in Primary 5, she had to eat two servings in order to fill her stomach.
To put the serving sizes in perspectiv­e, I estimate that it would take about four servings of canteen food to get a similar serving size as that at a mixed-rice stall at hawker centres.
Getting this amount of food at a primary school canteen would translate to spending $6.40 to $8.
And drinks made from syrup are sold at up to $1 a glass.
I hope the Ministry of Education can look into the cost of school canteen food to help parents with the cost of living. OnFacebook Do taxi drivers need more protection during the ongoing pandemic? Absolutely essential for them to get protection as well as support from taxi operators. Their services are essential for many Singaporea­ns, and their day-to-day operations and income have been drasticall­y affected by the pandemic. Tey Ngan Yen Labour chief represents voice of workers Tackle problem of foreign workers using false addresses We thank the writers of these two letters for their views:
Labour chief post should be held by Cabinet minister, July 17; and Politicall­y neutral labour chief in workers’ best interests, July 22.
The position of secretary-general of the National Trades Union Congress is elected by union delegates and the NTUC central committee once every four years at the NTUC National Delegates’ Conference (the last conference was held in October last year).
This is an election process that is independen­t of our national political process. The fundamenta­l role of the secretary-general is to represent the voice of workers.
In Singapore, our unique model of tripartism takes centre stage in industrial relations, where unions, employers and government develop and shape policies to balance the interests of workers, companies and the nation.
We may have different views, but we always strive and collaborat­e towards the same goals to promote harmonious labour-management relations and boost Singapore’s economic competitiv­eness. Carol Parrington Last month, I wrote about how my home address had been falsely used by a certain foreign worker to register his place of residence (Home address falsely used by foreign workers, June 6).
Immediatel­y after the letter was published, I got a late payment reminder from StarHub for a bill incurred by yet another foreign worker who had used my address for his mobile contract.
After I contacted StarHub, I was promised that my address would be removed as the registered address of this particular foreign worker.
But just last week, I received yet another late payment reminder addressed to the same foreign worker.
I have heard from friends and read on social media many similar stories of addresses falsely used by foreign workers.
It is happening frequently enough that something has to be done quickly.
Declaring a false address is an offence and should not be taken lightly. Just punish offenders (who refuse to wear a mask inside taxis) heavily. That way, not only will taxi drivers get more protection, but the risk will be minimised for all of us as well. Mary Liew Andy Lau President
National Trades Union Congress Everyone should wear a mask. Passengers shouldn’t lower their masks when inside the cab, especially when they are talking. PUB staff must follow Covid-19 safety rules Jimmy Lee Yes, as they are in close contact with many different passengers in an enclosed space daily, and hence face a higher risk of catching the virus. Ong Kok Lam and the results came back negative.
PUB would like to apologise for their slip-up.
Disciplina­ry action will be taken against them after due inquiry. We thank Mr Lee Keng Yeow for his feedback (Workers did not keep masks on inside house, July 27).
The two officers attended to a water supply issue at Mr Lee’s home last week. One of the officers had lowered his face mask to smell the water but did not pull up his mask properly thereafter. As essential workers who regularly attend to customers’ feedback, PUB staff are under strict instructio­ns to adhere to Covid-19 safety measures. These include wearing the appropriat­e protective gear, such as face masks, at all times.
Following the incident, both PUB officers were tested for Covid-19 Letters should be meant for exclusive publicatio­n in The Straits Times. They should be no longer than 400 words and must include the writer’s full name, address and phone numbers. The Forum editor reserves the right to edit the letters. For women, please indicate Miss, Ms, Mrs or Madam. Please e-mail your letter to stforum@sph.com.sg. Readers can also respond to letters via Facebook and Twitter.
