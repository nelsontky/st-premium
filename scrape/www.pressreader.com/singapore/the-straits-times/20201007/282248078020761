    <p>Firms that have taken a hit dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic have wel­comed the Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore’s (MAS) ex­tended credit re­lief mea­sures, es­pe­cially as business prospects con­tinue to be hazy for the fore­see­able fu­ture.</p>
    <p>But while some say that the debt mora­to­rium is a much-needed life­line, oth­ers are wary of the down­sides, es­pe­cially the ac­cu­mu­la­tion of in­ter­est rate charges.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, MAS an­nounced the ex­ten­sion of sev­eral re­lief mea­sures into next year, in­clud­ing giv­ing firms be­tween three and six more months to re­sume full loan re­pay­ments, de­pend­ing on the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Those in the hard­est hit sec­tors – such as avi­a­tion, tourism and land trans­port – have been al­lowed to de­fer 80 per cent of prin­ci­pal pay­ments on loans granted by banks or fi­nance com­pa­nies un­til June 30 next year. Oth­ers can de­fer pay­ment un­til March 31.</p>
    <p>Among those set to ben­e­fit from the ex­ten­sion is bus man­u­fac­turer SC Auto, for which the mora­to­rium has helped eased the bur­den as it grap­ples with di­min­ished rev­enue.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has drawn on loan fa­cil­i­ties for growth and in­ter­na­tion­al­i­sa­tion in re­cent years, and took a loan from United Overseas Bank un­der the tem­po­rary bridg­ing loan scheme ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>But the firm’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Rachel Lee is con­cerned that the three months of ex­ten­sion to March 31 may be in­suf­fi­cient, es­pe­cially as there is no re­cov­ery in sight for the tourism in­dus­try, which SC Auto counts as a ma­jor cus­tomer.</p>
    <p>“That is just six months from now, and it’s quite un­likely that there will be sig­nif­i­cant re­cov­ery, not just for our com­pany, but also for the world’s econ­omy, by then.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ang Yuit, vice-pres­i­dent of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Small and Medium En­ter­prises, said the ex­ten­sion is much-needed by small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs), which are highly geared and re­liant on sec­tors worst hit by Covid-19, such as travel, tourism and even some re­tail seg­ments.</p>
    <p>But this is likely to be a small per­cent­age of SMEs, he added, not­ing that the ma­jor­ity of firms have had some time to re-eval­u­ate their mar­ket po­si­tion­ing over the past sev­eral months since the out­break.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, SMEs that are in a po­si­tion to pay off their in­ter­est and prin­ci­pal are look­ing to do so in­stead of fur­ther de­fer­ring loan re­pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Gao Ji Foods man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Chong Yik Hwee shared that the com­pany had taken a tem­po­rary bridg­ing loan from DBS Bank, which was a good life­line dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod when business at its 65 food out­lets – in­clud­ing restau­rants and food stalls – dropped to about 50 per cent.</p>
    <p>He said: “Most of our trans­ac­tions are in cash, and if we are able to do so, we would pre­fer to pay off both the prin­ci­pal and in­ter­est. We would rather avoid ow­ing the bank money if we can help it.”</p>
    <p>Mr John Kong, group chief ex­ec­u­tive of build­ing ma­te­ri­als sup­plier M Me­tal, said that while the com­pany has been ser­vic­ing its tem­po­rary bridg­ing loan fully, the ex­ten­sion of the debt mora­to­rium is a “good in­sur­ance pol­icy”.</p>
    <p>But whether the com­pany can con­tinue its full loan re­pay­ments also de­pends on whether the con­struc­tion in­dus­try, which it works closely with, gets back up to speed by the start of next year, he added.</p>
