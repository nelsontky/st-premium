    <p>Work­ing from home helps Ms Tu­lasi Pan­neer­sel­vam, se­nior cre­ative at PBA Robotics, get into her cre­ative zone.</p>
    <p>“Some­times, to help my­self fo­cus, I like to blast my mu­sic. That’s some­thing I can’t do in the of­fice,” said Ms Tu­lasi, 29, who works on the firm’s cor­po­rate vi­su­als, such as lo­gos.</p>
    <p>She counts a cam­paign pro­mot­ing Sun­burst UV Bots – ro­bots de­ployed to dis­in­fect sur­faces and thus help pre­vent the spread of in­fec­tious dis­eases, viruses and bac­te­ria – that the com­pany launched amid the pan­demic as one of her proud­est achieve­ments in her two years of work­ing at the firm.</p>
    <p>“It’s one of the big­gest cam­paigns I’ve worked on, and I man­aged to do it re­motely,” she said.</p>
    <p>Struc­ture is another rea­son why she feels more pro­duc­tive at home as meet­ings are planned ahead.</p>
    <p>“If I have a meet­ing be­tween 1pm and 2pm, I can spend time af­ter­wards, say, be­tween 3pm and 6pm, to fo­cus on my de­signs,” she said.</p>
    <p>The of­fice en­vi­ron­ment, with more peo­ple around, can be slightly</p>
    <p>dis­rup­tive, she added.</p>
    <p>But she does miss be­ing able to just drop by her col­leagues’ desks to get the in­for­ma­tion she needs for work. “I’ll have to e-mail them in­stead,” she added.</p>
    <p>Be­ing at home is also bet­ter for Ms Vanessa Manichon, 32, chief of staff at start-up Del­e­gate. By not hav­ing to com­mute from her home in Pung­gol to Raf­fles Place, she uses the hour she saves to be more pro­duc­tive while work­ing at home.</p>
    <p>Del­e­gate is an on­line mar­ket­place that helps peo­ple who are plan­ning events source venues and ven­dors such as food cater­ers.</p>
    <p>“My home of­fice set-up is also a lot more er­gonomic with my mon­i­tor screen and key­board,” she said, com­par­ing it with the lap­top she uses at the co-work­ing space.</p>
    <p>“One thing I also truly ap­pre­ci­ate is the abil­ity to con­trol the tem­per­a­ture at home. Not hav­ing the cen­tralised air-con­di­tion­ing sys­tem blast­ing down... is a big plus for me,” she added.</p>
