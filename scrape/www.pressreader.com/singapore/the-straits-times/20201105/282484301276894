    <p>SHANG­HAI • China’s ac­cu­mu­lated im­ports of goods will ex­ceed US$22 tril­lion (S$30 tril­lion) over the next decade, and the coun­try is ac­cel­er­at­ing its open­ing up de­spite the global coro­n­avirus pan­demic, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing via video mes­sage at the open­ing cer­e­mony of the China In­ter­na­tional Im­port Expo in Shang­hai.</p>
    <p>China opted to push ahead with its an­nual im­port fair this year, a rare in-per­son trade event held dur­ing the pan­demic, al­beit with strin­gent ca­pac­ity lim­its and health re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts said it was a sig­nal that the coun­try is open for busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The coun­try is set to be the only ma­jor economy to grow this year after largely bring­ing the epi­demic un­der con­trol, fol­low­ing its emer­gence in the cen­tral city of Wuhan last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi said China wants to make its mar­ket “the world’s mar­ket”, as it moves to­wards a new “dual cir­cu­la­tion” eco­nomic model.</p>
    <p>It will, for ex­am­ple, re­duce the coun­try’s im­port re­stric­tions, treat all com­pa­nies reg­is­tered in China equally and sign more trade agree­ments with other coun­tries, he said.</p>
    <p>He added that the world needs to work to­gether, stand against uni­lat­er­al­ism and not “throw punches” at one another as the global economy is fac­ing many chal­lenges, es­pe­cially with the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 is a stark re­minder that all coun­tries are in a com­mu­nity with a shared fu­ture. No one can stay im­mune in a ma­jor cri­sis,” he said in his key­note speech.</p>
    <p>“We need to trust rather than sec­ond-guess one another; we need to join hands with rather than throw punches at one another; we need to con­sult rather than slan­der one another.”</p>
    <p>Big coun­tries need to lead by ex­am­ple, ma­jor economies need to act on sound prin­ci­ples, and de­vel­op­ing coun­tries should play an ac­tive part in pro­mot­ing open­ing up and shar­ing re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, Mr Xi added. He also called on all coun­tries to safe­guard the mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing sys­tem, im­prove the rules of global eco­nomic gov­er­nance and build an open world economy.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions be­tween China and other coun­tries have ratch­eted up over the past year.</p>
    <p>Its re­la­tion­ship with the United States has been par­tic­u­larly strained over topics such as tech­nol­ogy and trade, and US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion has launched a raft of sanc­tions against Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi said China will work for the early sign­ing of the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP).</p>
    <p>The RCEP trade deal in­volves the 10 Asean mem­bers, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, as well as Aus­tralia, China, Ja­pan, New Zealand and South Korea.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi also promised to con­tinue to shrink so-called neg­a­tive lists for in­vest­ment, which close cer­tain sec­tors to for­eign par­tic­i­pa­tion, and to shorten the list of re­stricted tech­nol­ogy im­ports.</p>
    <p>Many in­ter­na­tional com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing some top players in the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals, med­i­cal ap­pli­ance, dairy, au­to­mo­tive and con­struc­tion equip­ment sec­tors, have signed up to join the expo, which in­cludes mul­ti­ple busi­ness sem­i­nars and fo­rums on the side­lines, Chi­nese of­fi­cials have said. The event runs un­til next Tues­day.</p>
