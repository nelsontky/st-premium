    <p>•</p>
    <p>South Korea will mo­bilise mil­i­tary forces in its cap­i­tal Seoul to help front-line health work­ers deal with a surge in coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, as 689 new cases were re­ported yes­ter­day and the death toll and num­ber of pa­tients in crit­i­cal care rose.</p>
    <p>Of the new cases, 673 were lo­cally trans­mit­ted, which brings the coun­try’s tally to 40,786, the Korea Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion Agency (KDCA) said.</p>
    <p>The death toll in­creased by eight to 572 deaths, KDCA re­ported.</p>
    <p>The surge in cases has de­liv­ered a blow to South Korea’s vaunted pan­demic-fighting sys­tem, which suc­cess­fully used in­va­sive trac­ing, test­ing and quar­an­tines to avoid lock­downs and blunt pre­vi­ous waves, and keep in­fec­tions be­low 50 a day for much of the sum­mer.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties scram­bled to set up hos­pi­tal beds in ship­ping con­tain­ers this week to ease the strain on med­i­cal fa­cil­i­ties stretched by the lat­est coro­n­avirus wave.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of pa­tients in se­ri­ous or se­vere con­di­tion has grown to nearly 170, prompt­ing the health au­thor­i­ties to seek more beds na­tion­wide.</p>
    <p>Call­ing the cur­rent wave a crit­i­cal cri­sis, Prime Min­is­ter Chung Syekyun said he will dis­patch around 800 mil­i­tary, po­lice and gov­ern­ment work­ers in ev­ery dis­trict of the greater Seoul area to help track down po­ten­tial pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Front-line work­ers and med­i­cal staff are strug­gling each day to con­duct end­less epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions as well as with test­ing, and se­cur­ing suf­fi­cient beds, as con­firmed cases grow in var­i­ous ar­eas, in­clud­ing the metropoli­tan Seoul area, Mr Chung told a gov­ern­ment meet­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“In the end, in or­der to tamp down this wave, it is key to seize the vic­tory in virus-preven­tion ef­forts in the greater Seoul area,” said Mr Chung.</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity of the new cases have been re­ported in the cap­i­tal city of Seoul, the neigh­bour­ing port city of In­cheon, and Gyeonggi prov­ince, which is home to 13.5 mil­lion peo­ple and sur­rounds both cities.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the KDCA has been in talks with Korea Su­per­freeze, a cold stor­age lo­gis­tics com­pany, for a con­tract to store Covid-19 vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Com­pany chief ex­ec­u­tive Kim Jin-ha said some rooms in its cold­est ware­house are so frigid that a cup of warm wa­ter thrown into any of them will im­me­di­ately turn into snow.</p>
    <p>Lo­cated 65km south of Seoul and boast­ing tem­per­a­tures frostier than an Antarc­tic win­ter, the fa­cil­ity would be the best, per­haps only, place in the coun­try suit­able for bulk stor­age of Pfizer’s coro­n­avirus vac­cine, which needs to be stored at mi­nus 70 deg C.</p>
    <p>“As soon as we heard about the Pfizer vac­cine, we started get­ting ready... other op­tions wouldn’t work,” Mr Kim told Reuters, adding that the ware­house’s use of liq­ue­fied nat­u­ral gas to keep tem­per­a­tures down trumped elec­tric­ity.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has been in talks with the KDCA since last month. While noth­ing is set in stone, ex­pec­ta­tions are high that it will land a con­tract.</p>
    <p>The agency has asked Korea Su­per­freeze – which is backed by Gold­man Sachs and SK Hold­ings – to pro­vide plans and cost es­ti­mates for stor­ing and dis­tribut­ing vac­cines, in­clud­ing how it would han­dle a sce­nario where vac­cines would be shipped to 260 dif­fer­ent lo­ca­tions, Mr Kim said.</p>
    <p>South Korea has ar­ranged to buy 20 mil­lion doses of the vac­cine de­vel­oped by Pfizer and its Ger­man part­ner BioNTech.</p>
    <p>The coun­try also has deals for 20 mil­lion doses each of the vac­cines de­vel­oped by Moderna and As­traZeneca/Ox­ford Univer­sity and an­other four mil­lion doses from John­son & John­son.</p>
    <p>The ship­ments are ex­pected to ar­rive no later than next March.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim said it was not clear to him if the agency would tap the com­pany for vac­cines other than Pfizer’s that have less oner­ous cold stor­age re­quire­ments. Moderna’s vac­cine can be stored for up to six months at mi­nus 20 deg C, while As­traZeneca’s needs only nor­mal fridge tem­per­a­tures.</p>
    <p>To ac­com­mo­date Pfizer’s vac­cine, Korea Su­per­freeze is plan­ning a ded­i­cated pas­sage­way and el­e­va­tor so there is no in­ter­fer­ence from out­side tem­per­a­tures. Once it con­firms it has a con­tract, it will be­gin con­struc­tion, which may take two to three months.</p>

The cold stor&#xAD;age lo&#xAD;gis&#xAD;tics firm has been in talks with the Korea Dis&#xAD;ease Con&#xAD;trol and Preven&#xAD;tion Agency about a con&#xAD;tract to store Covid-19 vac&#xAD;cines.
