    <p>Hong Kong’s de­ci­sion to post­pone the up­com­ing Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil (Legco) elec­tions has drawn con­dem­na­tion from the United States.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Satur­day, US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo said the US “con­demns the Hong Kong gov­ern­ment’s de­ci­sion”, and that there is “no valid rea­son to de­lay” the elec­tions.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong leader Car­rie Lam last Fri­day post­poned the Sept 6 elec­tions by a year, cit­ing the rise in Covid-19 cases in the city. The de­ci­sion came af­ter 12 prodemoc­racy can­di­dates were dis­qual­i­fied from run­ning for per­ceived sub­ver­sive in­ten­tions and op­po­si­tion to a new se­cu­rity law im­posed by Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Urg­ing the Hong Kong au­thor­i­ties to re­con­sider their de­ci­sion, Mr Pom­peo said the elec­tions should be held in a way that re­flects the Hong Kong peo­ple’s as­pi­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>“If they aren’t, then re­gret­tably, Hong Kong will con­tinue its march to­wards be­com­ing just an­other com­mu­nist-run city in China,” he said.</p>
    <p>HONG KONG • US Sec­re­tary of State Michael Pom­peo has con­demned Hong Kong’s de­ci­sion to de­lay its Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil elec­tion by a year and urged the city’s gov­ern­ment to re­con­sider.</p>
    <p>“There is no valid rea­son for such a lengthy de­lay,” Mr Pom­peo said in a state­ment on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>“This re­gret­table ac­tion con­firms that Bei­jing has no in­ten­tion of up­hold­ing the com­mit­ments it made to the Hong Kong peo­ple and the United King­dom un­der the Si­noBri­tish Joint Dec­la­ra­tion, a UN-reg­is­tered treaty, and the Ba­sic Law.”</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo said the Hong Kong au­thor­i­ties should hold the elec­tion as close as pos­si­ble to Sept 6, the orig­i­nal date set.</p>
    <p>Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam an­nounced the post­pone­ment last Fri­day, cit­ing a re­cent surge i n Covid-19 cases. The Asian fi­nan­cial hub saw 121 coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions that day, af­ter record­ing its high­est tally yet on Thurs­day. The city is grap­pling with a new wave of cases that has seen tighter re­stric­tions – in­clud­ing a two-per­son limit on pub­lic gath­er­ings – that could fur­ther af­fect tra­di­tional cam­paign­ing.</p>
    <p>“De­lay­ing the Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil elec­tion held every four years is a very dif­fi­cult de­ci­sion,” Mrs Lam said. “But in or­der to curb the pan­demic, en­sure pub­lic safety and cit­i­zens’ health, and mean­while en­sure the elec­tion is held un­der an open and fair en­vi­ron­ment, this de­ci­sion is nec­es­sary.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam said she was in­vok­ing an emer­gency pow­ers or­di­nance to de­lay the vote and that the gov­ern­ment’s de­ci­sion to do so had the sup­port of China’s cen­tral gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>She said de­ploy­ing as many as 34,000 elec­tion day vol­un­teers across over 600 polling sta­tions to as­sist mil­lions of vot­ers was too dan­ger­ous un­der the cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong and Ma­cau Af­fairs Of­fice, which re­ports to China’s State Coun­cil, said the de­ci­sion to de­lay the elec­tion “re­flects a highly re­spon­si­ble at­ti­tude to­wards the life and health of Hong Kong cit­i­zens. It is very nec­es­sary, rea­son­able and le­gal”.</p>
    <p>The post­pone­ment of the vote to Sept 5, 2021 comes af­ter Hong Kong’s gov­ern­ment drew new red lines on how much dis­sent it would tol­er­ate, and stands to in­ten­sify global con­cerns about the preser­va­tion of ba­sic free­doms.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has started to roll back the city’s so­called spe­cial trad­ing sta­tus amid wider ten­sions with China.</p>
    <p>White House spokesman Kayleigh McE­nany last Fri­day said the elec­tion de­lay “un­der­mines the demo­cratic pro­cesses and free­doms that have un­der­pinned Hong Kong’s pros­per­ity”.</p>
    <p>Pro-democ­racy ad­vo­cates had hoped to ride the mo­men­tum of a land­slide vic­tory in last Novem­ber’s District Coun­cil vote to an un­prece­dented ma­jor­ity in the leg­is­la­ture. They are al­ready reel­ing from the Bei­jing-im­posed na­tional se­cu­rity law in June, which has been widely crit­i­cised and led to puni­tive mea­sures by the US ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s gov­ern­ment last week banned op­po­si­tion can­di­dates and ar­rested ac­tivists un­der the sweep­ing se­cu­rity law for com­ments made on­line. That led to in­ter­na­tional con­dem­na­tion from the US, Aus­tralia and Bri­tain, while lo­cal democ­racy ac­tivists and hu­man rights groups said the city’s gov­ern­ment was sup­press­ing free speech among op­po­si­tion groups.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion law­maker Fer­nando Che­ung said the de­ci­sion was un­con­sti­tu­tional. “The pan­demic was used purely as an ex­cuse. The real rea­son for the de­lay is that the CCP is afraid it will lose by a land­slide, much like what hap­pened in the district elec­tion in Novem­ber last year,” he said, re­fer­ring to the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party.</p>
    <p>About 55 per cent of peo­ple re­spond­ing to a re­cent sur­vey be­lieved the Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil elec­tion should go ahead as planned on Sept 6, de­spite the pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to the Hong Kong Pub­lic Opin­ion Pro­gramme, which polled 8,805 re­spon­dents be­tween July 27 and 30. Some 21 per cent thought the elec­tion should be post­poned by no more than six months.</p>
    <p>The curbs on Hong Kong prodemoc­racy ac­tivists and op­po­si­tion politi­cians have in­creased dra­mat­i­cally since Bei­jing drafted and im­posed the na­tional se­cu­rity law, by­pass­ing the city’s leg­is­la­ture. The new leg­is­la­tion bars sub­ver­sion, se­ces­sion, ter­ror­ism and col­lu­sion with for­eign forces, with pun­ish­ments as harsh as life in pri­son.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam’s ad­min­is­tra­tion and the cen­tral gov­ern­ment in Bei­jing have de­fended the law as a way to re­store sta­bil­ity and pros­per­ity to Hong Kong af­ter some­times-vi­o­lent protests last year helped push the city into a re­ces­sion – only to be bat­tered again by the pan­demic. But lawyers and ac­tivists have said the law’s vaguely worded clauses could be used to si­lence dis­si­dents and po­lit­i­cal op­po­nents.</p>
