    <p>When it comes to choos­ing stocks, most in­vestors use tra­di­tional fi­nan­cial met­rics such as earn­ings, re­turn on eq­uity and net as­set value. Some might look at charts while oth­ers use a com­bi­na­tion of fun­da­men­tals and tech­ni­cal in­di­ca­tors.</p>
    <p>It is about time re­tail in­vestors looked at an­other im­por­tant as­pect – the com­pany’s cor­po­rate gover­nance. This is be­cause com­pa­nies that are well gov­erned tend to per­form bet­ter than those with weak or poor gover­nance.</p>
    <p>A re­search pa­per, “Good gover­nance driv­ing cor­po­rate per­for­mance?” by Deloitte and Nyen­rode Busi­ness Univer­sity, found there is con­clu­sive ev­i­dence that good gover­nance vari­ables – namely, board in­de­pen­dence, di­ver­sity, re­mu­ner­a­tion, char­ac­ter­is­tics of the chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer, over­sight and own­er­ship struc­ture – are all im­por­tant in en­hanc­ing cor­po­rate per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>In 2017, a Bos­ton Con­sult­ing Group study noted: “An anal­y­sis of more than 300 of the world’s largest phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal, con­sumer goods, oil and gas, bank­ing and tech com­pa­nies found that those with more eth­i­cal op­er­a­tions... make big­ger prof­its and are more highly val­ued than com­peti­tors.”</p>
    <p>In that same year, a Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity study noted that the Sin­ga­pore Cor­po­rate Gover­nance Award win­ners over a pe­riod of four years out­per­formed the Straits Times In­dex.</p>
    <p>IM­POR­TANCE OF GOVER­NANCE</p>
    <p>Cor­po­rate gover­nance prac­tices have gained more promi­nence since the high-pro­file col­lapses of a num­ber of large cor­po­ra­tions such as En­ron and WorldCom and, lately, Wire­card, most of which in­volved ac­count­ing fraud and cor­po­rate mis­con­duct.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, there have been sev­eral high-pro­file cor­po­rate scan­dals that can be traced to weak gover­nance, start­ing with the PanElec­tric cri­sis in the mid-1980s, to China Avi­a­tion Oil, Ci­ti­raya In­dus­tries and Ac­cord Care Cus­tomer Ser­vices in the early 2000s, fol­lowed by the S-chips de­ba­cle be­tween 2004 and 2010.</p>
    <p>In many cases of cor­po­rate fail­ures, the root prob­lem was in­suf­fi­cient risk con­trols.</p>
    <p>In a study of listed com­pa­nies’ an­nual re­ports, the Se­cu­ri­ties In­vestors As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore) or Sias found that:</p>
    <p>Only 4.6 per cent of com­pa­nies dis­closed that their board set the risk tol­er­ance and that there was a risk man­age­ment pol­icy de­scrib­ing the tol­er­ance for var­i­ous classes of risk.</p>
    <p>Only 23.9 per cent of com­pa­nies dis­closed their key risks and how th­ese risks were as­sessed and man­aged.</p>
    <p>Only 30.2 per cent of com­pa­nies dis­closed their non-fi­nan­cial per­for­mance in­di­ca­tors.</p>
    <p>Given the cur­rent Covid-19 pan­demic and the added stress and risks that com­pa­nies are faced with, the lack of a risk man­age­ment pol­icy and guid­ance of risk by the board can re­sult in mis­man­ag­ing pos­si­ble op­por­tu­ni­ties while un­der­play­ing po­ten­tial threats.</p>
    <p>To il­lus­trate the im­por­tance of hav­ing proper risk con­trols, con­sider that the dis­tress which wa­ter treat­ment firm Hyflux finds it­self in can be traced to in­suf­fi­cient at­ten­tion to the risk of di­ver­si­fy­ing away from its core busi­ness into power gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>QUES­TIONS TO ASK</p>
    <p>As it stands to­day, ba­sic in­vestor ed­u­ca­tion mostly fo­cuses on the tra­di­tional fi­nan­cial met­rics. This is the old text­book ap­proach.</p>
    <p>What in­vestors must learn also is that to ob­tain a com­plete pic­ture of their in­vest­ments, they should take into ac­count cor­po­rate gover­nance prac­tices. To do so, they have to go be­yond fi­nance-based prin­ci­ples.</p>
    <p>Most im­por­tantly, they must un­der­stand that com­pa­nies are only as good as their em­ploy­ees and, in this re­gard, that se­nior man­age­ment and the board are par­tic­u­larly cru­cial in in­still­ing a cul­ture of trans­parency and hon­esty.</p>
    <p>In­vestors should be­gin by fa­mil­iaris­ing them­selves with the prin­ci­ples and pro­vi­sions of the Sin­ga­pore Code of Cor­po­rate Gover­nance – not just its let­ter but also its spirit.</p>
    <p>When con­sid­er­ing a com­pany as an in­vest­ment, they should ask how closely it ad­heres to the code and, among other fac­tors, look at is­sues such as whether there is enough of an in­de­pen­dent el­e­ment on the board, how much di­ver­sity is present and how it treats its share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>MAKE USE OF AVAIL­ABLE RE­SOURCES</p>
    <p>A good start­ing point would be to use the Sin­ga­pore Gover­nance and Trans­parency In­dex (SGTI) scores that are pro­vided on the ex­treme right-hand col­umn of the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change’s Stock Screener pages un­der the head­ing “GTI”.</p>
    <p>The SGTI is com­piled by the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Cen­tre for Gover­nance, In­sti­tu­tions and Or­gan­i­sa­tions (CGIO) and is aimed at as­sess­ing com­pa­nies on their cor­po­rate gover­nance dis­clo­sure and prac­tices, as well as the time­li­ness, ac­ces­si­bil­ity and trans­parency of their fi­nan­cial re­sults an­nounce­ment.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies are scored on the ba­sis of board re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, rights of share­hold­ers, en­gage­ment of stake­hold­ers, ac­count­abil­ity and au­dit, and dis­clo­sure and trans­parency.</p>
    <p>Just to il­lus­trate, some of the ques­tions the SGTI asks are whether the chair­man is an in­de­pen­dent direc­tor, whether at least one of the in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tors has ex­pe­ri­ence in the in­dus­try the com­pany is in, and whether share­hold­ers have the op­por­tu­nity to ap­prove re­mu­ner­a­tion for the non-ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tors.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, in­vestors can aug­ment the SGTI with Sias’ Cor­po­rate Gover­nance Awards frame­work, which rates com­pa­nies based on five ar­eas, or Stars: share­hold­ers’ rights and eq­ui­table treat­ment; trans­parency and dis­clo­sure; ac­count­abil­ity and au­dit; re­spon­si­bil­i­ties of the board; and stake­hold­ers’ roles.</p>
    <p>The Stars scor­ing sys­tem was de­vel­oped with the CGIO and cat­e­gorises com­pa­nies into five bands. Data is also pro­vided for pre­vi­ous years so in­vestors can track whether the gover­nance prac­tices of prospec­tive com­pa­nies have im­proved over time.</p>
    <p>By fa­mil­iaris­ing them­selves with the SGTI and Stars, in­vestors will learn how to take an ac­tive in­ter­est in the busi­nesses they are putting their money into and to ask the right ques­tions when eval­u­at­ing com­pa­nies and their man­age­ments.</p>
    <p>If they are un­able to do so, they can rely on the ques­tions Sias poses on ev­ery com­pany’s an­nual re­port.</p>
    <p>If more share­hold­ers do this, then the cor­po­rate sec­tor will have an in­cen­tive to im­prove and change for the bet­ter. Gover­nance-savvy in­vestors, through their ac­tions, can also help in­stil proper mar­ket discipline, which is es­pe­cially im­por­tant in a regime that is heav­ily re­liant on dis­clo­sures.</p>
    <p>To­day, good cor­po­rate gover­nance has evolved to in­clude not just strong in­ter­nal ac­count­ing and risk con­trols that would mit­i­gate the chance of fi­nan­cial loss, but also a whole range of eth­i­cal, hon­est and trans­par­ent prac­tices.</p>
    <p>A well-gov­erned com­pany is one that man­ages its re­la­tion­ships prop­erly, par­tic­u­larly how its man­age­ment, board of di­rec­tors, its em­ploy­ees, its stake­hold­ers and share­hold­ers deal with one an­other.</p>
    <p>There should be mu­tual re­spect on all counts and this should also ex­tend to ex­ter­nal re­la­tion­ships with cus­tomers, reg­u­la­tors and the wider com­mu­nity, the ul­ti­mate goal be­ing to re­duce con­flicts of in­ter­est and to en­sure the com­pany acts in the best in­ter­ests of stake­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>There is, of course, no guar­an­tee that strong gover­nance will def­i­nitely trans­late to higher stock prices. But pick­ing com­pa­nies with strong gover­nance will help re­duce the risk of loss due to cor­po­rate mis­be­haviour and it would com­ple­ment the tra­di­tional ap­proaches of us­ing fun­da­men­tals and tech­ni­cal anal­y­sis. As a re­sult, in­vestors would surely be bet­ter off.</p>
    <p>In­vestors must un­der­stand that com­pa­nies are only as good as their em­ploy­ees and, in this re­gard, that se­nior man­age­ment and the board are par­tic­u­larly cru­cial in in­still­ing a cul­ture of trans­parency and hon­esty.</p>
    <p>By fa­mil­iaris­ing them­selves with the SGTI and Stars, in­vestors will learn how to take an ac­tive in­ter­est in the busi­nesses they are putting their money into and to ask the right ques­tions when eval­u­at­ing com­pa­nies.</p>
