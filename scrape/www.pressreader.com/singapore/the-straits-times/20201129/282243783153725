    <p>1 Your at­ten­tion is be­ing sold to ad­ver­tis­ers</p>
    <p>There are many ser­vices on the In­ter­net peo­ple think of as free, but they are not, says Mr Justin Rosen­stein, a for­mer en­gi­neer at Face­book, who cre­ated the “like” but­ton.</p>
    <p>“They are paid for by ad­ver­tis­ers. Why do ad­ver­tis­ers pay those com­pa­nies? They pay in ex­change for show­ing their ad­ver­tise­ments to us. We are the prod­uct. Our at­ten­tion is the prod­uct be­ing sold to ad­ver­tis­ers.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tim Kendall, a for­mer ex­ec­u­tive at Face­book and for­mer pres­i­dent of Pin­ter­est, says: “Let’s fig­ure out how to get as much of this per­son’s at­ten­tion as we pos­si­bly can... How much of your life can we get you to give to us?” 2 So­cial</p>
    <p>me­dia is de­signed to keep you re­turn­ing</p>
    <p>You re­ceive an e-mail say­ing a friend tagged you in a photo. In­stinc­tively, you click to see the pic­ture. Mr Jeff Seib­ert, a for­mer ex­ec­u­tive at Twit­ter, says: “It is not some­thing you can just de­cide to ig­nore... What you should be ask­ing your­self is: ‘Why doesn’t that e-mail con­tain the photo in it?’ It would be a lot eas­ier to see the photo.”</p>
    <p>3 So­cial me­dia is not a pas­sive tool</p>
    <p>Mr Tris­tan Har­ris, co-founder of the Cen­ter for Hu­mane Tech­nol­ogy, says peo­ple have moved from hav­ing a tools-based tech­nol­ogy en­vi­ron­ment to one based on ad­dic­tion and ma­nip­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing bi­cy­cles as an ex­am­ple of tools, he adds: “So­cial me­dia isn’t a tool that is just wait­ing to be used. It has its own goals and it has its own means of pur­su­ing them by us­ing your psy­chol­ogy against you.”</p>
    <p>4 Tech com­pa­nies ex­per­i­ment on users to de­velop the most op­ti­mal way to ma­nip­u­late them</p>
    <p>“We are all lab rats,” says Mr Sandy Parak­i­las, a for­mer op­er­a­tions man­ager at Face­book. “It is not like they are try­ing to ben­e­fit us. We are just zom­bies and they want us to look at more ad­ver­tise­ments so they can make more money.”</p>
    <p>5 So­cial me­dia ad­dic­tion is real</p>
    <p>So­cial me­dia is a drug, says Dr Anna Lem­bke, med­i­cal di­rec­tor of ad­dic­tion medicine at the Stan­ford Univer­sity School of Medicine. “I am wor­ried about my kids. And if you have kids, I am wor­ried about your kids,” she says.</p>
    <p>It is re­vealed that she re­minds her chil­dren about top­ics such as the risk of ad­dic­tion every day.</p>
    <p>In the film, her 15-year-old son James says he spends 11/ hours on</p>
    <p>2 his mo­bile phone a day. But a check on the de­vice re­veals that he ac­tu­ally spends al­most twice as long.</p>
    <p>6 So­cial me­dia is shap­ing the young</p>
    <p>De­pres­sion and anx­i­ety among Amer­i­can teenagers be­gan in­creas­ing rapidly be­tween 2011 and 2013, as did sui­cides among girls.</p>
    <p>The pat­tern points to so­cial me­dia, says Dr Jonathan Haidt, a so­cial psy­chol­o­gist at the New York</p>
    <p>Univer­sity Stern School of Busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Gen Z – those who were born in the late 1990s and on­wards – is the first gen­er­a­tion that got on so­cial me­dia in mid­dle school. “How do they spend their time? They come home from school and they are on their de­vices. A whole gen­er­a­tion is more anx­ious, more frag­ile, more de­pressed,” he adds.</p>
    <p>This gen­er­a­tion is much less com­fort­able tak­ing risks, he con­tin­ues. “The rates at which they get driv­ers’ li­cences have been drop­ping. The num­ber who have ever gone out on a date, or had any kind of ro­man­tic in­ter­ac­tion, is drop­ping rapidly. This is a real change in a gen­er­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Mr Kendall adds: “It is plain as day to me. Th­ese ser­vices are killing peo­ple and caus­ing peo­ple to kill them­selves.”</p>
