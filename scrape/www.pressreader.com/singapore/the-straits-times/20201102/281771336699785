    <p>A su­per ty­phoon slammed into the Philip­pines early yes­ter­day, af­fect­ing nearly 32 mil­lion and killing at least 10 as it brought hur­ri­cane-force winds and dumped heavy rain across the main is­land of Lu­zon.</p>
    <p>Ty­phoon Goni, lo­cally known as Rolly, made land­fall at around 5am in Catan­d­u­anes prov­ince in Bi­col, some 500km south-east of Manila, with winds of up to 225kmh and short gusts of 310kmh.</p>
    <p>“Ar­eas along the path of the eye of the storm are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a very dan­ger­ous sit­u­a­tion… cat­a­strophic vi­o­lent winds and in­tense to tor­ren­tial rain­fall,” weather fore­caster Chris Perez said at a news brief­ing.</p>
    <p>The ty­phoon tore off roofs, tipped over walls, up­rooted trees, trig­gered land­slides and set off storm surges that flooded coastal towns across the Bi­col re­gion, home to close to six mil­lion. Peo­ple were spot­ted sit­ting on rooftops, as rain poured down and flood wa­ters swept through their vil­lages.</p>
    <p>Power was knocked out in ar­eas bat­tered by fierce winds, in­clud­ing some large ci­ties in met­ro­pol­i­tan Manila, the densely pop­u­lated cap­i­tal re­gion of more than 13 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Cavite prov­ince, just an hour south of Manila, was placed un­der a “state of calamity”.</p>
    <p>Equiv­a­lent to a Cat­e­gory 5 hur­ri­cane, Goni is the strong­est ty­phoon to hit any­where in the world so far this year.</p>
    <p>It is ham­mer­ing the same re</p>
    <p>gions still reel­ing from the fury of an­other ty­phoon, Molave, which last week left 22 peo­ple dead.</p>
    <p>It has also evoked mem­o­ries of Ty­phoon Haiyan in Novem­ber 2013, which left more than 7,300 peo­ple dead or miss­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Fran­cis Bichara, gov­er­nor of Al­bay, re­ported that at least four peo­ple in the prov­ince died. One man was killed when a tree tipped over and fell on him.</p>
    <p>He added that sev­eral dikes burst, caus­ing fast-mov­ing floods that killed three, in­clud­ing a fiveyear-old boy. Mud­slides were also re­ported on the slopes of Mayon vol­cano, sweep­ing away sev­eral houses.</p>
    <p>The Of­fice of Civil De­fence later said 10 peo­ple had died in Al­bay.</p>
    <p>Mr Ri­cardo Jalad, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of the na­tional dis­as­ter agency, said the ty­phoon af­fected over 31.9 mil­lion peo­ple. More than 350,000 were evac­u­ated, he added.</p>
    <p>Manila’s air­ports and rail ser­vices were shut down.</p>
    <p>Health Sec­re­tary Fran­cisco Duque said thou­sands of Covid-19 pa­tients and health work­ers had been moved from their quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties to day-care cen­tres, public schools, ho­tels and mo­tels.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines has the se­cond high­est Covid-19 in­fec­tions and deaths in South-east Asia, next only to In­done­sia, with 383,113 cases and 7,238 deaths.</p>
    <p>Fore­cast­ers said Goni’s eye may hit or graze met­ro­pol­i­tan Manila late yes­ter­day to early to­day. The ty­phoon may con­sid­er­ably weaken af­ter it hits the Sierra Madre moun­tain range, then cross Lu­zon towards the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>As of noon yes­ter­day, the weather bu­reau down­graded its clas­si­fi­ca­tion of Goni from a su­per ty­phoon to a “very strong ty­phoon”, with max­i­mum winds down to 215kmh. Goni is the 18th ty­phoon to hit the Philip­pines this year.</p>
    <p>The coun­try is the first ma­jor land mass fac­ing the Pa­cific cy­clone belt. It gets hit by an av­er­age of 20 storms and ty­phoons each year.</p>
