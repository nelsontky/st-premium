    <p>CHENGDU • Re­tiree Li Chang­ming just bought a new Huawei smart­phone, but the 70-year-old is still a bit puz­zled by a high-tech de­vice that China’s pol­i­cy­mak­ers hope will help un­lock spend­ing by mil­lions of older Chi­nese.</p>
    <p>Un­de­terred, he has en­rolled in a train­ing ses­sion – sort of a “Mo­bile Phones 101” course – that is part of China’s plans to help its le­gions of pen­sion­ers keep up in a fast-de­vel­op­ing dig­i­tal econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“I don’t un­der­stand all the func­tions yet but I want to learn,” Mr Li said, tap­ping gin­gerly at the smart­phone screen. “You’re never too old to learn.”</p>
    <p>He and his el­derly class­mates in the south-western city of Chengdu sat and lis­tened as an in­struc­tor ex­pounded on the use of pop­u­lar Chi­nese apps, nav­i­ga­tion with map pro­grams and how to change phone set­tings.</p>
    <p>De­mon­strat­ing how to shut down back­ground apps, the teacher tried to use terms that the el­derly stu­dents could grasp.</p>
    <p>China is push­ing a years-long ef­fort to boost do­mes­tic con­sump­tion to bring bal­ance to an econ­omy tra­di­tion­ally over-re­liant on man­u­fac­tur­ing and gov­ern­ment in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>E-com­merce is a cen­tral pil­lar. Vast and grow­ing amounts of Chi­nese eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity are now han­dled through dig­i­tal apps that have be­come part of the fab­ric of life in mod­ern China, led by Ten­cent’s WeChat Pay and its ri­val Ali­pay, run by Alibaba spin-off Ant Group.</p>
    <p>To­gether, they dom­i­nate the huge Chi­nese on­line pay­ments in­dus­try, typ­i­fied by shop­pers scan­ning QR codes to make pur­chases rather than us­ing phys­i­cal cash, which has be­come old-fash­ioned in China.</p>
    <p>Brands world­wide are chas­ing the so-called “sil­ver dol­lar” and gov­ern­ments are also keen to get el­derly sav­ings flow­ing into economies to boost growth.</p>
    <p>China’s age­ing pop­u­la­tion of­fers a par­tic­u­larly rich op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese re­tirees are ex­pected to num­ber 300 mil­lion by 2025, and Daxue Con­sult­ing now es­ti­mates the size of the coun­try’s el­derly econ­omy at around 4.9 tril­lion yuan (S$1 tril­lion).</p>
    <p>Bei­jing says 98 per cent of ru­ral ar­eas are now con­nected to 4G In­ter­net net­works.</p>
    <p>Most re­tirees in China are keen to adopt new tech­nol­ogy and tap a grow­ing range of mo­bile ser­vices cater­ing to them.</p>
    <p>A re­port by bank­ing group UBS this year said older con­sumers were “al­ready catch­ing up” with the younger gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“We can’t live with­out smart­phones,” said 61-year-old res­i­dent Meng Li, who also joined the Chengdu course and only re­cently learnt how to make mo­bile pay­ments.</p>
    <p>“I knew only how to make a call at first, but af­ter my daugh­ter showed me more and I joined train­ing ses­sions like to­day’s, I can han­dle it now.”</p>
    <p>Last month, the gov­ern­ment called for a na­tion­wide push to “strengthen the abil­ity of the el­derly” to use dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy, urg­ing com­mu­ni­ties to hold train­ing ses­sions and devel­op­ers to cre­ate el­derly-friendly apps.</p>
    <p>This has be­come even more im­per­a­tive in the era of the coro­n­avirus, which emerged in the Chi­nese city of Wuhan.</p>
    <p>Re­sult­ing lock­downs forced con­sumers into on­line shop­ping and home de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>More than 36 mil­lion more peo­ple got on­line for the first time between March and June, of­fi­cial fig­ures show – rep­re­sent­ing a raft of po­ten­tial new on­line spenders.</p>
    <p>Just get­ting around dur­ing the pan­demic re­quires dig­i­tal flu­ency.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic trans­port and many venues in China re­quire citizens to show a health app that rates their coro­n­avirus threat level based on re­cent travel and other habits.</p>
    <p>An­other push is China’s on­go­ing 10-year cen­sus that, for the first time, Bei­jing wants most res­i­dents to re­spond to on­line.</p>
    <p>But nearly a third of the na­tion’s 1.4 bil­lion peo­ple are still of­fline.</p>
    <p>Mr Li and his class­mates, how­ever, have grad­u­ated to the dig­i­tal world. Af­ter class, he used his dig­i­tal wal­let to buy chilli pep­pers from a mar­ket, es­sen­tial in­gre­di­ents in Chengdu’s fa­mously spicy Sichuan cui­sine.</p>
    <p>He is also ex­cited about be­ing able to check restau­rant rat­ings be­fore go­ing out to eat, and us­ing map apps to get there.</p>
    <p>Look­ing at his new pur­chase through his read­ing glasses, the sil­ver-haired re­tiree still has many plans. “There are still many things I have to learn. Mas­ter­ing pho­tos on my mo­bile is my goal for the next 10 years,” he said.</p>
