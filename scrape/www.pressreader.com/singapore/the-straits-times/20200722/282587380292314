    <p>UNITED STATES • Deep down, Mr Rayvon Owen al­ready knew he was gay when a class­mate in­tro­duced him to life sim­u­la­tion video game The Sims back in 2003, when they were in sixth grade in Rich­mond, Vir­ginia.</p>
    <p>“I grew up in a very con­ser­va­tive, re­li­gious home. My mum was su­per strict and over my shoul­der a lot, and when I started play­ing The Sims I would show her this happy typ­i­cal family with a white picket fence,” he said.</p>
    <p>“And she was like, ‘Oh good, I like this game. You get a job, you man­age money, get a wife and kids.’”</p>
    <p>Mr Owen laughed. One of the most pop­u­lar games in the world, The Sims has for two decades pro­vided young people with a vir­tual social sand­box to ex­plore the joys, ter­rors and mys­ter­ies of adult life for the first time.</p>
    <p>While puerile tox­i­c­ity does char­ac­terise some precincts of gam­ing, The Sims has long been at the van­guard of main­stream en­ter­tain­ment in­clu­sion sim­ply by giv­ing play­ers choices.</p>
    <p>Mr Owen, 29, a singer now liv­ing in Los An­ge­les, did not dis­cuss his sex­u­al­ity pub­licly un­til 2016, af­ter ap­pear­ing as a fi­nal­ist on Amer­i­can Idol.</p>
    <p>This week, he is sched­uled to de­but as the host of a dif­fer­ent re­al­ity tele­vi­sion com­pe­ti­tion: The Sims Spark’d, a new show based on the game.</p>
    <p>While com­pet­i­tive e-sports have long been broad­cast around the globe, Spark’d is poised to be­come the first main­stream re­al­ity show based on an elec­tronic game.</p>
    <p>And as a re­al­ity show, it hews closely to the tried-and-true formula pop­u­larised by hits such as Project Run­way, with 12 con­tes­tants com­pet­ing in var­i­ous ingame chal­lenges – “De­sign two ri­val fam­i­lies from dif­fer­ent neigh­bour­hoods”, for ex­am­ple — while vy­ing to win US$100,000 (S$139,000).</p>
    <p>For con­tes­tants – 10 women, two men – the se­ries draws mainly from Sims con­tent cre­ators with sig­nif­i­cant fol­low­ings on YouTube and Twitch.</p>
    <p>While there are some rel­a­tively mi­nor con­flicts, Spark’d is not heavy on in­ter­per­sonal drama. The cam­eras do not fol­low the con­tes­tants back to their ho­tel and the over­all vibe of the show is whole­some rather than sala­cious.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the show fo­cuses on al­low­ing the con­tes­tants to tell sto­ries in the game that re­flect their own lives and ex­pe­ri­ences. Is­sues of gen­der, sex­u­al­ity, race and class fig­ure heav­ily.</p>
    <p>In that sense, the true nar­ra­tive emerges from the per­sonal mean­ing the game seems to hold for both con­tes­tants and judges, al­most all in their 20s.</p>
    <p>“The theme of the show and the game is you come as you are and play how­ever rep­re­sents you,” said Ms Tayla Parx, 26, a singer and song­writer who is one of the judges. “For me as a bi­sex­ual black woman, I al­ways found the game re­ally valu­able.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing able to play with family dy­nam­ics and sex­ual dy­nam­ics, it’s made to ex­plore the bound­aries of you in a way that’s re­ally beau­ti­ful. The worst that can hap­pen is you re­build again if you don’t like it.”</p>
    <p>“It’s all about, how do we make the game re­flect the world we live in?” said Ms Lyn­d­say Pear­son, the gen­eral man­ager of The Sims for the video game com­pany that pub­lishes it, Elec­tronic Arts.</p>
    <p>“The world we live in changes and the sto­ries our play­ers want to tell change and we em­brace that.</p>
    <p>For the show, that’s re­ally what we want to come through.”</p>
    <p>Within the game, in­di­vid­ual com­puter-con­trolled char­ac­ters in­ter­act with one an­other with­out re­gard to gen­der or racial ap­pear­ance un­til they are prompted by a hu­man player.</p>
    <p>“Hon­estly, the game was al­ways a ther­a­peu­tic ex­pe­ri­ence,” said the show’s host, Mr Owen.</p>
    <p>“The show is fun and it’s ex­cit­ing to host, but there is a deeper mean­ing that re­lates to this whole jour­ney of com­ing out and get­ting into a place of self-ac­cep­tance, not just for me, but for a lot of people.”</p>
