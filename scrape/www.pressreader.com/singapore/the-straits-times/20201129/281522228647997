    <p>Drink stalls get no re­spect.</p>
    <p>When Net­flix makes a show about Sin­ga­pore food, it’s about this noo­dle or that soup, but never about teh or kopi. Where is the love of the ar­ti­sanal Milo Bomb? Where is the her­itage walk for chin chow ban­dung?</p>
    <p>Oh, you’ve never heard of chin chow ban­dung? That’s be­cause you have been brain­washed by Big Mee Pok. Re­ject the lies of the Chicken Rice elites.</p>
    <p>The rea­son my eyes have been opened is be­cause Grab in­vited me to spend a cou­ple of hours at the 724 Food Cen­tre in Ang Mo Kio.</p>
    <p>At the Long Quan Cha Shi stall, I made tea, cof­fee, some­thing called The Dragon and learnt that peo­ple here have far too many words for drink strength and sweet­ness – se­ri­ously, we need a stan­dard­ised chart and num­ber scale.</p>
    <p>Mr Ja­son Toh, 33, helped me learn the ropes. His fa­ther has run the stall since the food cen­tre opened about 40 years ago. He is help­ing his dad get through the pan­demic down­turn, which hit drink stalls hard be­cause the busi­ness re­lies heav­ily on walk-ins.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers who get takeaways are less likely to buy a drink as they are easy enough to make at home and would you pay the fee of $5 or so for a Grab­Food or­der for a tea or cof­fee that costs less than $2?</p>
    <p>I pop around to see the younger Toh in the af­ter­noon when it is quiet. It is mostly take­away or­ders now, but we get the oc­ca­sional sit-down cus­tomer.</p>
    <p>Mr Toh and I fit in the stall, barely. He can bang out a tea or cof­fee in un­der 30 sec­onds – mugs with con­densed milk are al­ready lined up on a shelf, we grab one, add a shot of con­cen­trated tea or cof­fee and a splash of hot water to di­lute, pop in a spoon and that’s it.</p>
    <p>But it is rarely ever that straight­for­ward. Ev­ery­one wants it cus­tomised. You all have things go­ing on in your life that call for your drink to be unique.</p>
    <p>There are so many lev­els of strength, sweet­ness and tem­per­a­ture they ran out of Hokkien words for them, so had to steal from Malay, Hockchew, Can­tonese and, I think, an­cient Baby­lo­nian. It is a dan­ger­ous and il­log­i­cal lin­guis­tic struc­ture built out of ne­ces­sity and a les­son in the haz­ards of in­di­vid­u­al­ism run amok.</p>
    <p>Par­ents, if you over­hear your chil­dren us­ing Hockchew units of mea­sure­ment – note the warn­ing signs, like, if they text us­ing words like “siu dai” or “tiloh” or watch Tik­Toks with peo­ple mak­ing a thing called yuan yang kosong peng – please take them to a Star­bucks im­me­di­ately. There is no time to waste.</p>
    <p>The Tohs help me put to rest a few drink-stall myths.</p>
    <p>First, that every stall makes drinks the same way. At their stall, if you ask for a kopi (cof­fee with con­densed milk), they don’t add more sugar. As Mr Toh ex­plains with pride, if you don’t skimp on the milk – which some shops do – you don’t have to add sugar.</p>
    <p>To stand out from the drink-stall pack, they have a sig­na­ture drink, The Dragon. Note the cap­i­tals. It’s lime, honey, but­ter­fly pea tea and more, and it is layer upon layer of glo­ri­ous colour, all for $2.60 and it is de­li­cious.</p>
    <p>Or­ders ap­pear on the Tohs’ Grab ter­mi­nal. I yelp with ex­cite­ment when it beeps but Mr Toh is one cool cus­tomer – with a glance, he gauges the time it will take for the rider to get here and the drink will get made just be­fore pick-up, so cold things are cold and hot things are hot when they are de­liv­ered. This is the kind of fore­sight we need more of in the cor­po­rate world.</p>
    <p>I fin­ish my shift just be­fore the din­ner rush so the Tohs can run their busi­ness with­out a guy who can’t tell his gah dai (ex­tra sugar)from his gao (thick or stronger brew) mess­ing up their flow.</p>
    <p>Grab got me squeez­ing sugar cane with the Tohs be­cause the com­pany has just launched some­thing called Hawker</p>
    <p>Cen­tre 2.0 and...Wait! Come back! Hang in there, the dry stuff will be over soon.</p>
    <p>The scheme is sev­eral things, but as far the Tohs are con­cerned, it lets Grab­Food cus­tomers add drinks from their stall on the same or­der with a sin­gle de­liv­ery fee.</p>
    <p>There is more to the scheme, such as how Grab makes it easy for hawk­ers to list their prod­ucts on the app menu. To test, I use the ter­mi­nal to take a photo of their hawthorn drink, key in a cou­ple of de­tails and it ap­pears in­stantly as an op­tion. If you want to know more, read about it here (str.sg/JbFg).</p>
    <p>To find sell­ers like the Tohs, once you are in the Grab app, browse shops near you. Par­tic­i­pat­ing food cen­tres grouped un­der “all-in-one de­liv­ery fee” should ap­pear.</p>
    <p>Get food, get drinks, get that durian chen­dol – what a time to be alive.</p>
