    <p>Amer­i­can cit­i­zens based in Sin­ga­pore are gear­ing up to cast their votes in the up­com­ing US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the United States Em­bassy in Sin­ga­pore said US cit­i­zens will be able to drop off their com­pleted bal­lot at the em­bassy to be mailed.</p>
    <p>US cit­i­zens in Sin­ga­pore will also be al­lowed to post their bal­lot them­selves – by mail or courier – to their lo­cal elec­tion of­fi­cials if they are will­ing to pay for in­ter­na­tional postage.</p>
    <p>The em­bassy said it abides by the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment’s safe dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
    <p>“If Amer­i­can cit­i­zens are drop­ping off their bal­lot at the em­bassy, they must ad­here to safe dis­tanc­ing guide­lines – tem­per­a­tures will be checked be­fore en­try, masks must be worn at all times and safe dis­tanc­ing must oc­cur. We have signs and tape on the ground, and staff are de­ployed to en­sure safety and com­pli­ance,” the spokesman added.</p>
    <p>Vot­ing in the US is man­aged by each state. Each lo­cal­ity in the US is re­spon­si­ble for send­ing out ab­sen­tee bal­lots to vot­ers who have re­quested a bal­lot. Vot­ers must then re­turn the bal­lot to their elec­tion of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Some states al­low vot­ing by e-mail or fax. Other states only al­low pa­per bal­lot by mail.</p>
    <p>Over the last few months, vot­ers here have closely mon­i­tored both can­di­dates – in­cum­bent Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and Demo­cratic can­di­date and for­mer vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den – on the cam­paign trail.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump and Mr Bi­den locked horns in the first of three planned pres­i­den­tial de­bates in Cleve­land, Ohio, last Tues­day night.</p>
    <p>The 90-minute de­bate at Case Western Re­serve Univer­sity and the Cleve­land Clinic was mod­er­ated by Fox News host Chris Wal­lace and was aired at 9am Sin­ga­pore time on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>For Mr Steven Okun, 54, this will be the fifth time he is cast­ing his vote from Sin­ga­pore. He has been a res­i­dent here since 2003.</p>
    <p>Mr Okun, a senior ad­viser at McLarty As­so­ciates, said the re­cent pres­i­den­tial de­bate cast cur­rent Amer­i­can pol­i­tics in a neg­a­tive light.</p>
    <p>He said Mr Trump used the de­bate to un­der­score the in­tegrity of the elec­toral process by claim­ing that mail-in vot­ing is fraud­u­lent.</p>
    <p>Mr Okun added that the way the Covid-19 out­break was han­dled in the US was a per­ti­nent is­sue to be ad­dressed.</p>
    <p>“Un­til the US has a na­tional plan to con­trol Covid-19, noth­ing else will be re­solved,” he said.</p>
    <p>An­other voter based in Sin­ga­pore, Ms Tina Datta, de­scribed the Cleve­land de­bate as an ex­am­ple of ro­bust democ­racy in ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Datta, 52, is chair­man of Repub­li­cans Overseas Sin­ga­pore and has resided here for a decade.</p>
    <p>Not­ing the short­com­ings of the de­bate for­mat, she said: “I think the de­bate, for most of the Amer­i­can peo­ple, was un­for­tu­nate from the stand­point that nei­ther can­di­date was able to an­swer in com­plete sen­tences.”</p>
    <p>Ms Datta said Mr Bi­den did not di­rectly ad­dress the ques­tions raised dur­ing the de­bate. One of the sig­nif­i­cant is­sues raised was the rule of law, she added.</p>
    <p>The pres­i­den­tial con­test was thrown into dis­ar­ray last Fri­day when Mr Trump an­nounced that he and his wife Me­la­nia had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>He was due to meet Mr Bi­den on Oct 15 in Mi­ami, Florida, and on Oct 22 in Nashville, Ten­nessee, for the sec­ond and third pres­i­den­tial de­bates be­fore the Nov 3 polls.</p>
