    <p>Dur­ing a re­cent What­sApp chat with a col­league on shop­ping, I con­fessed to an ig­no­rance about fash­ion and how I had once thought Burberry – the Bri­tish fash­ion la­bel – was a fruit.</p>
    <p>Shortly af­ter, an ad­ver­tise­ment for the lux­ury brand popped up on my In­sta­gram feed.</p>
    <p>This was the first time that a plat­form rec­om­mended an up­mar­ket item to me.</p>
    <p>Like many oth­ers who have had such ex­pe­ri­ences, I won­dered if social media gi­ant Face­book was us­ing What­sApp or even my phone’s mi­cro­phone to eaves­drop on my con­ver­sa­tions, and feed me ad­ver­tise­ments on things I had talked about.</p>
    <p>Face­book owns both What­sApp and In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>Be­yond find­ing such en­coun­ters dis­turb­ing, is there any­thing that we can do to stop tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies from screen­ing our pri­vate lives?</p>
    <p>The short an­swer is: Not in­di­vid­u­ally, but we can do so in a group. Col­lec­tive ac­tion is nec­es­sary to get tech com­pa­nies to change.</p>
    <p>To­day, In­ter­net-based ser­vices are en­trenched in our daily lives. Ob­jects linked to the In­ter­net have ex­tended be­yond com­put­ers and smart­phones, to smart­watches, fit­ness track­ers, robot vac­uum clean­ers and many oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies gain ac­cess to our pri­vate lives through the data gath­ered by th­ese de­vices. In fact, many tech com­pa­nies’ business mod­els are based on col­lect­ing and har­ness­ing users’ per­sonal data in ex­change for their ser­vices.</p>
    <p>This level of dig­i­tal in­va­sive­ness is set to in­crease world­wide, in­clud­ing in Sin­ga­pore where dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion is set to ac­cel­er­ate un­der the Smart Na­tion ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies get a con­stant stream of data on users’ habits and pref­er­ences via the de­vices used.</p>
    <p>This pro­vides a “one-way mir­ror” for com­pa­nies to pro­file con­sumers in ways that they do not know and can­not con­test, as Har­vard Univer­sity’s pro­fes­sor of social psy­chol­ogy Shoshana Zuboff points out in an ar­ti­cle in The Wash­ing­ton Post.</p>
    <p>Th­ese “data dou­bles” of con­sumers – a term used by aca­demics – are sold in a mar­ket built by com­pa­nies col­lect­ing and sell­ing them to par­ties who want th­ese per­sonal in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Most of us have never heard of the names of th­ese data bro­kers, cat­e­gorised un­der third par­ties in the no­tices that we agree to be­fore us­ing In­ter­net ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Some of my peers find con­cerns about cor­po­rate data col­lec­tion im­ma­te­rial. In fact, many may find it con­ve­nient to re­ceive per­sonal ad­ver­tis­ing tar­geted to their needs.</p>
    <p>As for con­cerns over pri­vacy – un­less one is a celebrity or a high-rank­ing gov­ern­ment of­fi­cial – there seems to be lit­tle rea­son for com­pa­nies to care about our lives.</p>
    <p>Th­ese ar­gu­ments op­er­ate on two as­sump­tions.</p>
    <p>They as­sume that our data is bought by only ad­ver­tis­ers.</p>
    <p>They also pre­sume that our unique data char­ac­ter­is­tics are not im­por­tant enough for in­sti­tu­tions such as fu­ture em­ploy­ers and in­surance com­pa­nies to track.</p>
    <p>How­ever, per­sonal data can be used in ways we would not ex­pect.</p>
    <p>Last month, Amer­i­can media com­pany Vice Media claimed that anonymised lo­ca­tion in­for­ma­tion by the Sin­ga­pore-based Mus­lim Pro app was sold through third-party data bro­ker X-mode to en­ti­ties such as the United States mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral Sin­ga­porean users of the app took to on­line fo­rums to ex­press their sur­prise that the app, which fea­tures ser­vices like iden­ti­fy­ing prayer di­rec­tion, could even sell such data to for­eign agents.</p>
    <p>While th­ese claims have been re­futed by the app’s de­vel­op­ers and are be­ing in­ves­ti­gated by Sin­ga­pore’s Per­sonal Data Pro­tec­tion Com­mis­sion (PDPC), it il­lus­trates how per­sonal data used on a seem­ingly in­nocu­ous app may be sold to third-party com­pa­nies users are not aware of.</p>
    <p>What can users do to safe­guard their pri­vacy and data?</p>
    <p>One ex­treme is to de­mand an ab­so­lute right to pri­vacy.</p>
    <p>But that risks be­com­ing un­duly oner­ous for busi­nesses with le­git­i­mate in­ter­ests to use data for good, such as to im­prove the ef­fi­ciency of their ser­vices.</p>
    <p>In prac­tice, we reg­u­larly make choices to un­der­mine pri­vacy by agree­ing to pri­vacy poli­cies with­out read­ing them.</p>
    <p>Rather than de­mand­ing an ab­so­lute right to pri­vacy, we can do more to care about who con­trols our per­sonal data.</p>
    <p>For a start, cit­i­zens can take a more ac­tive in­ter­est in scru­ti­n­is­ing apps and com­pa­nies that col­lect data on them and un­der­stand bet­ter what is be­ing col­lected.</p>
    <p>They can then ask for a greater say in such use of their data. They can also de­cide how to be tracked by ad­just­ing their browser’s pri­vacy and se­cu­rity set­tings.</p>
    <p>“In essence, we don’t ac­tu­ally want to keep our in­for­ma­tion se­cret – we just want a greater say in man­ag­ing how it is used,” said Pro­fes­sor Si­mon Ch­ester­man, dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s fac­ulty of law.</p>
    <p>“Most of us un­der­stand that cor­po­ra­tions and gov­ern­ments around the world col­lect vast amounts of data. The key ques­tion is in what cir­cum­stances they can use and dis­close that data,” he told The Sun­day Times, re­spond­ing to queries about the ad­e­quacy of lo­cal data pro­tec­tion reg­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, per­sonal data is pro­tected by the Per­sonal Data Pro­tec­tion Act (PDPA).</p>
    <p>Per­sonal data refers to any in­for­ma­tion that an in­di­vid­ual can be iden­ti­fied from.</p>
    <p>Un­der the PDPA, Sin­ga­pore­ans con­trol their per­sonal data mainly by us­ing their abil­ity to give or with­hold con­sent. For ex­am­ple, we click “agree” when in­formed about the pur­poses and cir­cum­stances our per­sonal data will be col­lected for.</p>
    <p>Yet, how ef­fec­tive is such con­sent if many of us do not un­der­stand what we are agree­ing to and can­not pro­pose al­ter­na­tive terms?</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the PDPC sup­ple­ments this by act­ing on be­half of con­sumers against unwanted in­fringe­ments by com­pa­nies. Hence, it in­ves­ti­gated the Mus­lim Pro app af­ter com­plaints sur­faced.</p>
    <p>It also sets guide­lines and best prac­tices for or­gan­i­sa­tions to pro­tect per­sonal data.</p>
    <p>Apart from re­ly­ing on the PDPC, there is room for dig­i­tal ad­vo­cacy, in scru­ti­n­is­ing and giv­ing feed­back to the PDPC on the terms of what tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies are ask­ing con­sumers to agree to.</p>
    <p>One ex­am­ple of this is Euro­pean non-profit group None of Your Business (NYOB), which scru­ti­nises and files le­gal cases against ma­jor tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>On Nov 16, it an­nounced that it filed com­plaints against Ap­ple’s Iden­ti­fier for Ad­ver­tis­ers track­ing code for ev­ery iPhone.</p>
    <p>The unique code al­lows Ap­ple and third par­ties to track users and com­bine in­for­ma­tion about their on­line and mo­bile be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>In Europe, track­ing is per­mit­ted only if users ex­plic­itly con­sent to it. In this case, NYOB claims that it was in­tro­duced with­out the users’ knowl­edge or con­sent.</p>
    <p>One might say that given the over­whelm­ing con­trol that tech­nol­ogy firms have over our data, should we even bother to chal­lenge their ac­tions?</p>
    <p>My an­swer is that we wouldn’t know if we didn’t try.</p>
    <p>In­di­vid­u­als re­duc­ing their car­bon foot­print would not af­fect cli­mate change much.</p>
    <p>But col­lec­tively, they are be­gin­ning to make an im­pact.</p>
    <p>If cli­mate change ac­tivists sim­ply gave up be­cause it seemed im­pos­si­ble to curb the ex­cesses of hu­man ac­tiv­ity, we would not see a grow­ing cli­mate change agenda.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, I be­lieve that change is pos­si­ble if we see the ex­ces­sive reach of tech­nol­ogy as some­thing that so­ci­ety can ob­ject to.</p>
    <p>For that, we need dig­i­tal ad­vo­cates who push for data pro­tec­tion.</p>
