    <p>HONG KONG • The shelving of the keenly an­tic­i­pated Hong KongSin­ga­pore travel bub­ble shows just how del­i­cate the process of re­open­ing bor­ders is – even for places that have largely con­tained the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The cities’ Covid-19 out­breaks are far less in­tense than in places such as the United States and Europe, but a re­cent uptick in cases in Hong Kong proved enough to de­lay the start of the air cor­ri­dor be­tween the two fi­nan­cial hubs by two weeks, dash­ing the plans of those who had booked flights that were due to be­gin on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong yes­ter­day re­ported 73 new Covid-19 cases, the high­est daily fig­ure since Aug 16 when the city re­ported 74 cases.</p>
    <p>Many of the lat­est cases were linked to 14 dance clubs, in­clud­ing the Wan Chai Starlight Dance Club and Dance Cul­ture in Cause­way Bay. Hong Kong’s to­tal num­ber of con­firmed in­fec­tions stood at 5,702, with 108 re­lated deaths.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier yes­ter­day, Sec­re­tary for Food and Health Sophia Chan said the gov­ern­ment was re­view­ing the need to tighten fur­ther so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules, in­clud­ing clos­ing busi­nesses that in­volved ac­tiv­i­ties</p>
    <p>with a high risk of in­fec­tion, the South China Morn­ing Post re­ported.</p>
    <p>The travel bub­ble be­tween Hong Kong and Sin­ga­pore had been her­alded as a pan­demic world-first, al­low­ing people to travel to and from the two places with­out the need for quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>The launch will be de­ferred for two weeks, and a new launch date will be an­nounced later.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong and Sin­ga­pore had agreed that the bub­ble would be sus­pended for two weeks if the seven-day mov­ing av­er­age of the daily num­ber of un­linked</p>
    <p>Covid-19 cases is more than five in either city.</p>
    <p>That was not even met in Hong Kong be­fore last Saturday’s de­ci­sion, but the re­cent jump in in­fec­tions there was enough for the au­thor­i­ties to ap­ply the brakes.</p>
    <p>Bloomberg In­tel­li­gence an­a­lyst James Teo said: “Once more con­tact trac­ing is done in Hong Kong and most cases be­come linked, even if new daily cases re­main high, un­linked cases may start fall­ing be­low five a day con­sis­tently, al­low­ing the travel bub­ble to start.”</p>
    <p>While in-coun­try con­tain­ment of the coro­n­avirus has re­sulted in the world’s 10 busiest do­mes­tic air travel routes now all be­ing in Asia, ac­cord­ing to OAG Avi­a­tion World­wide, Hong Kong’s Cathay Pa­cific Air­ways and Sin­ga­pore Air­lines con­tinue to strug­gle as they have no do­mes­tic travel mar­ket to fall back on.</p>
    <p>Cathay’s shares slid 4.2 per cent</p>
    <p>yes­ter­day, their big­gest loss in two months, while Sin­ga­pore Air­lines fell less than 1 per cent.</p>
    <p>Even if the Hong Kong-Sin­ga­pore cor­ri­dor opens, the boost to the two avi­a­tion hubs will be lim­ited, said pro­fes­sor of trans­port Rico Merk­ert at The Univer­sity of Syd­ney Busi­ness School.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines and Cathay will con­tinue to strug­gle be­cause they can­not fun­nel onto the route taken by those trav­ellers who would nor­mally ar­rive from Europe and the US, he said.</p>
    <p>“With­out that feeder traf­fic, those bubbles will, at best, be lim­ited to the lo­cal pop­u­la­tion.”</p>
    <p>Air traf­fic glob­ally is ex­pected to be at just 33 per cent of last year’s lev­els at the end of this year, and “hope­fully” at 50 per cent to 60 per cent by the end of next year, ac­cord­ing to Mr Alexan­dre de Ju­niac, di­rec­tor-gen­eral of the In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
