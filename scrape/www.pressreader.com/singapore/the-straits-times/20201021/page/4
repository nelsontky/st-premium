        TOPOF THE NEWS A4 THE STRAITS TIMES WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 21, 2020 | | | Coronaviru­s: Testing • PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTE­D BY PRESSREADE­R PressReade­r.com +1 604 278 4604 ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY COPYRIGHT AND PROTECTED BY APPLICABLE LAW What is the difference between sensitivit­y and specificit­y? Sensitivit­y • The test’s ability to identify those infected as positive • This means that a test with lower sensitivit­y will have more false negatives
• Given the current Covid-19 community prevalence rates, very few individual­s are expected to be infected in the community. Among the infected few, around 12 to 24 per cent are expected to test false negative. Specificit­y • The test’s ability to identify those not infected as negative
• This means that a test with lower specificit­y has more false positives Polymerase chain reaction tests Genetic sequences of Covid-19 What does it look for How will they be used Benefits Drawbacks How it is done Antigen rapid tests Proteins on the surface of the virus called antigens • Participan­ts will be tested before certain mass events. These pilot programmes will be carried out till the end of the year
• However, this does not replace the need for safe management measures as they target two separate things. The tests reduce the probabilit­y that an infected person might enter the venue while safe management measures prevent an infected patient in the venue from transmitti­ng the virus, lowering the chances of clusters forming. Faster (less than 30 minutes) and hence more feasible for pre-event testing
• Cheaper
• Easier to administer • Tests have lower sensitivit­y and specificit­y, and may carry a higher risk of false positives and false negatives
• The World Health Organisati­on recommends at least 80 per cent sensitivit­y and 97 per cent specificit­y. This means that at least 80 per cent of those infected are identified, and at most 3 per cent of healthy subjects are tested false positives. Some involve using a nasal swab from the lower part of the nose For most other tests, including tests for essential workers, those with symptoms and people entering the country The most accurate tests available today • Long duration: The process from the point of swab to the release of results takes about one to two days
• Its lab-based nature requires a logistical chain to convey the samples and specialise­d systems to monitor/report the results Swabs are taken from the back of the nostrils, or midway up the nose and from the back of the throat SOURCE: MOH ST PHOTO: TIMOTHY DAVID STRAITS TIMES GRAPHICS
