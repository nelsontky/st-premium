    <p>I have a Subaru Forester. It is still run­ning on the same set of tyres when I bought it two years nine months ago. The mileage is 34,000km and the tyres are Bridge­stone Dueler H/L400, man­u­fac­tured in late 2017. Tyre ro­ta­tion was done at 8,000km, 18,000km and 28,000km at the Subaru ser­vice cen­tre, which also checked for side slip and wheel mis­align­ment. I no­ticed un­even wear at about 20,000km and pointed it out to the ser­vice cen­tre and a tyre work­shop. Both said this is com­mon for all-wheel-drive cars. I am un­sure about the ex­pla­na­tion as I have seen many other Foresters on the road with­out this prob­lem.</p>
    <p>The mileage of 34,000km you have clocked on that one set of tyres is above the av­er­age for a four-wheel-drive.</p>
    <p>Apart from that, the un­even wear you have ob­served is not ex­actly un­usual on a sport util­ity ve­hi­cle with fac­tory-fit­ted tyres.</p>
    <p>These tyres typ­i­cally have softer, more flex­i­ble side walls than the low-pro­file ones fit­ted to most pas­sen­ger cars.</p>
    <p>Hence dur­ing cor­ner­ing, the in­creased flex­i­bil­ity causes the ve­hi­cle to load up more on the outer cir­cum­fer­ence than evenly across the tread width.</p>
    <p>The re­sult is more wear on the outer treads, with some ev­i­dent on the cir­cum­fer­en­tial edge of the side wall.</p>
    <p>What­ever type of tyre you put on your wheels, al­ways en­sure the tyre pres­sures are cor­rect. Check­ing them reg­u­larly at the petrol sta­tion is a good main­te­nance rou­tine that ev­ery pas­sen­ger ve­hi­cle owner should prac­tise.</p>
    <p>Driv­ing style also partly de­ter­mines the de­gree and pat­tern of wear.</p>
    <p>For these rea­sons, not all Foresters will dis­play the same tyre wear as yours, even if they have iden­ti­cal mileages.</p>
