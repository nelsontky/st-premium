    <p>•</p>
    <p>In­dia’s new French Rafale jets have made “fa­mil­iari­sa­tion” flights above the border re­gion con­tested with China where a deadly clash be­tween soldiers from the two nu­clear-armed neigh­bours took place in June, an of­fi­cial told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>The first five war­planes of a US$9.4 bil­lion (S$12.8 bil­lion) or­der for 36 Rafale air­craft were for­mally com­mis­sioned on Sept 10, with De­fence Min­is­ter Ra­j­nath Singh call­ing them a “strong mes­sage” to New Delhi’s ad­ver­saries.</p>
    <p>“Rafale fighter jets have been fa­mil­iaris­ing in our op­er­a­tional ar­eas in­clud­ing Ladakh,” a se­nior air force of­fi­cial told AFP on Mon­day, on con­di­tion of anonymity.</p>
    <p>In mid-June, Chi­nese and In­dian soldiers en­gaged in vi­o­lent handto-hand fight­ing in the Ladakh re­gion that left 20 In­dian troops dead. China has also ac­knowl­edged suf­fer­ing ca­su­al­ties but has not re­vealed any fig­ures. In an­other in­ci­dent early this month, shots were fired for the first time in 45 years at the dis­puted Hi­malayan border.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment of the Rafale flights came as mil­i­tary com­man­ders from both sides held their lat­est round of talks aimed at eas­ing ten­sions. It was not re­vealed when the flights com­menced, but an AFP pho­tog­ra­pher saw a Rafale jet fly over Ladakh’s cap­i­tal Leh on Mon­day. In­dia’s de­fence min­istry had said dur­ing the com­mis­sion­ing that the fighter planes had “al­ready flown and fa­mil­iarised with our op­er­a­tional en­vi­ron­ment” with­out specif­i­cally men­tion­ing Ladakh.</p>
    <p>“(The Rafales) have un­der­gone in­tense in­te­grated train­ing with other com­bat fleets in­clud­ing fir­ing of ad­vanced weapons,” that state­ment added.</p>
    <p>In­dia ac­knowl­edges it is be­hind China and other key na­tions in mil­i­tary fire­power, and the pur­chase of the Rafale jets is one of many made in a bid to bol­ster its 1.4 mil­lion­strong army.</p>
