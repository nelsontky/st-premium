    <p>HONG KONG Eight Hong Kong democ­racy ac­tivists, in­clud­ing three for­mer l aw­mak­ers, were charged yes­ter­day over their part in a July protest, amid a broad crack­down by the au­thor­i­ties un­der a sweep­ing new se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>Those held in­clude “Long Hair” Le­ung Kwok Hung, for­mer Demo­cratic Party chief Wu Chi Wai, for­mer leg­is­la­tor Ed­die Chu and Figo Chan, the or­gan­iser of an an­nual rally mark­ing the han­dover of the city to China in 1997.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said the de­tainees were ac­cused of in­cit­ing, or­gan­is­ing and join­ing an “unau­tho­rised assem­bly” on July 1, for which they could face a max­i­mum of five years in jail. All the sus­pects were re­leased on bail be­fore their first court ap­pear­ance sched­uled for Dec 17.</p>
    <p>Chan said the pros­e­cu­tion would not de­ter him from tak­ing part in so­cial move­ments in fu­ture, re­ported RTHK.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing im­posed a na­tional se­cu­rity law in Hong Kong on June 30, a move aimed at crush­ing dis­sent in the in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial hub fol­low­ing months of huge and of­ten vi­o­lent protests last year.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of pro­test­ers took to the streets the day after its pas­sage, lead­ing to the ar­rest of over 370 peo­ple, in­clud­ing some for car­ry­ing ban­ners and flags adorned with pro-democ­racy slo­gans.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s ad­min­is­tra­tion in­sists the law has not im­pinged on the rights to free­dom of speech and assem­bly guar­an­teed to the ter­ri­tory when it re­turned to Chi­nese rule in 1997. But ac­tivists have spo­ken of a chill­ing ef­fect over the city’s op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>The US House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives voted on Mon­day to wel­come Hong Kong res­i­dents to live tem­po­rar­ily in the United States, vow­ing to be a bea­con for rights as China clamps down in the ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>The House moved by con­sen­sus to is­sue so-called Tem­po­rary Pro­tected Sta­tus for five years to Hong Kong res­i­dents, mean­ing that peo­ple from the fi­nan­cial hub will have the right to work in the US and will not be sub­ject to de­por­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive must still be ap­proved by the US Se­nate, but it en­joys sup­port across party lines – un­like a pre­vi­ous bid by Democrats to ex­tend the sta­tus to Venezue­lans, which was ef­fec­tively blocked by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Tom Mali­nowski, a Demo­crat who spon­sored the Hong Kong Bill, said the de­ci­sion to “self-con­fi­dently open our doors” was more pow­er­ful than mov­ing to “slap a few sanc­tions” on Chi­nese of­fi­cials, as the State Depart­ment again did on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>If the Se­nate ap­proves, Hong Kong would be the only wealthy place whose res­i­dents can en­joy Tem­po­rary Pro­tected Sta­tus, which has been is­sued by Congress or the White House to pro­tect hun­dreds of thou­sands of peo­ple from war-rav­aged na­tions such as So­ma­lia, Syria and Ye­men.</p>
