    <p>How do you teach on­line dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker when your stu­dent can­not sit through e-lessons be­cause of health rea­sons?</p>
    <p>Mrs Sr­ishti Sri­vas­tava Pin­gali had to re­act fast. Her eight-year-old stu­dent had se­vere my­opia and screen ex­po­sure gave him headaches, so he could man­age only 20 min­utes of screen time a day.</p>
    <p>The Grade 2 home­room teacher at Mid­dle­ton In­ter­na­tional School in Tampines al­lowed him to turn off his screen dur­ing live lessons and even de­layed dead­lines for writ­ten as­sign­ments so his par­ents could help him af­ter work and on week­ends.</p>
    <p>“It was learn­ing on the go,” the 42-year-old says of her home­based learn­ing (HBL) jour­ney. She teaches all sub­jects ex­cept spe­cial­ist ones like art.</p>
    <p>“We had never taught on­line be­fore, stu­dents did not have ad­e­quate ex­po­sure to dig­i­tal lit­er­acy and par­ents had never ex­pe­ri­enced any­thing like this ei­ther.”</p>
    <p>Mid­dle­ton ran full HBL classes for five weeks from April 13 to May 15, fol­lowed by a two-week hol­i­day. For most of June, it al­ter­nated be­tween weeks of class­room learn­ing and HBL, be­fore an­other term break of three weeks.</p>
    <p>Apart from the ped­a­gog­i­cal and tech­nol­ogy is­sues – Mrs Pin­gali once found her­self kicked out of her on­line class and her stu­dents thought she was prank­ing them – there were plenty of emo­tional chal­lenges to deal with, too.</p>
    <p>A stu­dent’s family was split across coun­tries as one par­ent could not re­turn to Sin­ga­pore on time, so she had to con­duct HBL across dif­fer­ent time zones. On­line farewells to ex­pa­tri­ate class­mates re­turn­ing home were teary-eyed but dis­con­nected af­fairs.</p>
    <p>As young chil­dren are not able to ex­press their emo­tions about the pan­demic well, the school’s grade level team in­tro­duced sto­ries such as The Giv­ing Tree and Munna And The Grain Of Rice. They helped the kids talk about their feel­ings about Covid-19 and en­cour­aged em­pa­thy.</p>
    <p>Mrs Pin­gali admits she strug­gled with “the feel­ing of not do­ing jus­tice to home or work” with so much on her plate. But be­ing open and hon­est about her dilem­mas with her kids, Eklavya, 13, and Veda, 11, paid div­i­dends, as they ended up teach­ing her how to edit videos and cre­ate dig­i­tal con­tent for her classes.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, hus­band Srid­har Pin­gali, 44, who is self-em­ployed, was her “rock” dur­ing the strenuous weeks of HBL.</p>
    <p>One un­ex­pected re­ward of the pan­demic was bond­ing with her stu­dents’ fam­i­lies as par­ents stepped up. “The un­der­stand­ing and em­pa­thy that came with the aware­ness that it was a new way of learn­ing and teach­ing for all of us, and that we were bound by the com­mon goal of look­ing out for our chil­dren, was some­thing that blew me away.”</p>
    <p>The best Teach­ers’ Day gift in this pan­demic year:</p>
    <p>“Par­ents and teach­ers de­vel­oped a great part­ner­ship through the HBL to see the chil­dren learn and grow. I would want this part­ner­ship of trust to con­tinue to grow.</p>
    <p>“On a more ma­te­ri­al­is­tic note, a box of choco­lates to share with the bunch that makes me love my job so much would be great.”</p>
