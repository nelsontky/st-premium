    <p>WASH­ING­TON/BEI­JING • Wash­ing­ton might sanc­tion those in­volved in the ar­rest of more than 50 peo­ple in Hong Kong and will send the US Am­bas­sador to the United Na­tions to visit Tai­wan, Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo said, draw­ing anger and the threat of re­tal­i­a­tion from Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo said he was also “ap­palled” by the ar­rest of an Amer­i­can cit­i­zen as part of Wed­nes­day’s crack­down, and added: “The United States will not tol­er­ate the ar­bi­trary de­ten­tion or ha­rass­ment of US cit­i­zens.”</p>
    <p>Hong Kong po­lice ar­rested 53 peo­ple in dawn raids on democ­racy ac­tivists on Wed­nes­day in the big­gest crack­down since China last year im­posed a se­cu­rity law, which op­po­nents say is</p>
    <p>aimed at quash­ing dis­sent in the for­mer Bri­tish colony.</p>
    <p>Among those de­tained was Amer­i­can lawyer John Clancey, a source at his firm said.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo called the ar­rests an “out­rage and a re­minder of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party’s con­tempt for its own peo­ple and the rule of law”.</p>
    <p>“The United States will con­sider sanc­tions and other re­stric­tions on any and all in­di­vid­u­als and en­ti­ties in­volved in ex­e­cut­ing this as­sault on the Hong Kong peo­ple,” he added.</p>
    <p>He said it would also “ex­plore re­stric­tions against the Hong Kong Eco­nomic and Trade Of­fice in the United States, and take ad­di­tional im­me­di­ate ac­tions against of­fi­cials who have un­der­mined Hong Kong’s demo­cratic pro­cesses”.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther ril­ing Bei­jing, Mr Pom­peo an­nounced in the same state­ment that Ms Kelly Craft, Wash­ing­ton’s UN am­bas­sador, would visit Chi­nese-claimed and demo­crat­i­cally run Tai­wan, a highly sym­bolic trip as the is­land is not a UN mem­ber due to the ob­jec­tions of Bei­jing, which views Tai­wan as a way­ward prov­ince.</p>
    <p>“Tai­wan shows what a free China could achieve,” he said.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Hua Chun­y­ing said Mr Pom­peo’s com­ments rep­re­sented a se­ri­ous in­ter­fer­ence in the coun­try’s in­ter­nal af­fairs, which China strongly con­demns.</p>
    <p>“China will take all nec­es­sary steps to res­o­lutely safe­guard its sovereignt­y and se­cu­rity in­ter­ests,” Ms Hua told re­porters. “The United States must pay a heavy price for its mis­takes.”</p>
    <p>Tai­wan’s For­eign Min­istry wel­comed Ms Craft’s visit, which will be the first of a sit­ting US am­bas­sador at the UN to the is­land, say­ing that it demon­strates the strong US sup­port for Tai­wan’s in­ter­na­tional par­tic­i­pa­tion.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has pur­sued hard­line poli­cies to­wards China on is­sues from trade to es­pi­onage and the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>His ad­min­is­tra­tion has i mposed sanc­tions on Chi­nese of­fi­cials for crush­ing Hong Kong’s pro-democ­racy move­ment and other al­leged rights abuses.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions have es­ca­lated within Wash­ing­ton on China pol­icy in the fi­nal days of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion be­fore Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den takes of­fice on Jan 20.</p>
    <p>The New York Stock Ex­change said on Wed­nes­day that it would delist three Chi­nese telecoms com­pa­nies, while the ad­min­is­tra­tion is also con­sid­er­ing adding tech­nol­ogy giants Alibaba and Ten­cent to a black­list of firms al­legedly owned or con­trolled by the Chi­nese mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions have es­ca­lated within Wash­ing­ton on China pol­icy in the fi­nal days of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion be­fore Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den takes of­fice on Jan 20.</p>
