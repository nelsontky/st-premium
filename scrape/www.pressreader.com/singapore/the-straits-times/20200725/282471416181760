    <p>• The 2020-21 English Premier League sea­son will be­gin on Sept 12 and the fi­nal round of matches will be held on May 23, the league an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The new sea­son, orig­i­nally sched­uled to be­gin on Aug 8, has been de­layed this year af­ter the Premier League sus­pended the 2019-20 sea­son for three months due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent sea­son will end with a fi­nal round of fix­tures to­mor­row, giv­ing teams about seven weeks to pre­pare for the next cam­paign.</p>
    <p>How­ever, teams still in the Cham­pi­ons League and Eu­ropa League will have l ess time to pre­pare should they ad­vance deeper into the knock­out stages, with the fi­nals of the two com­pe­ti­tions on Aug 23 and Aug 21 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The new sea­son kicks off af­ter the in­ter­na­tional break, with Euro­pean foot­ball’s govern­ing body Uefa an­nounc­ing last month that Na­tions League matches would be played be­tween Sept 3-8.</p>
    <p>The Premier League added that they would con­tinue to con­sult with the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion and the English Foot­ball League re­gard­ing the sched­ul­ing of do­mes­tic com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Liverpool’s Premier League ti­tle-win­ning cap­tain Jor­dan Hen­der­son was named Eng­land’s Foot­baller of the Year yes­ter­day in the an­nual vote of the Foot­ball Writ­ers’ As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Manchester City’s Kevin de Bruyne, Manchester United’s Mar­cus Rash­ford and Liverpool pair Vir­gil van Dijk and Sa­dio Mane made up the rest of the top five.</p>
    <p>Hen­der­son, 30, has been cen­tral to Liverpool’s suc­cess un­der man­ager Jur­gen Klopp through his lead­er­ship and tire­less mid­field work.</p>
    <p>“I don’t feel like any­thing I’ve achieved this sea­son or in fact dur­ing my whole ca­reer has been done on my own,” said Hen­der­son.</p>
    <p>“I owe a lot to so many dif­fer­ent peo­ple – but none more so than my cur­rent team­mates – who have just been in­cred­i­ble and de­serve this every bit as much as I do.”</p>
    <p>Two other Liverpool play­ers – Trent Alexan­der-Arnold and Alis­son Becker – also re­ceived votes.</p>
    <p>City man­ager Pep Guardi­ola be­lieves de Bruyne’s im­pact on the Premier League can­not be over­stated af­ter the play­maker, who has 11 goals and 19 as­sists in the league this sea­son, was snubbed.</p>
    <p>“The num­bers are in­cred­i­ble, not just this sea­son but also the year when we won the league (in 2018),” said the Spa­niard.</p>
