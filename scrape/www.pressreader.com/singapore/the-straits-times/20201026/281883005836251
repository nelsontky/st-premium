    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Agri­cul­tural depart­ment work­ers wear­ing pro­tec­tive suits have erad­i­cated the first nest of gi­ant “mur­der hor­nets” dis­cov­ered in the United States, vac­u­um­ing them out of a tree in Wash­ing­ton state.</p>
    <p>The nest of Asian gi­ant hor­nets was found last Thurs­day by Wash­ing­ton State Depart­ment of Agri­cul­ture (WSDA) en­to­mol­o­gists on a prop­erty in Blaine, near the bor­der with Canada, the agency said.</p>
    <p>They spent weeks search­ing for the nest, trap­ping hor­nets and track­ing them, us­ing den­tal floss to tie tiny ra­dio track­ers on the in­sects, which are nearly five cen­time­tres in length and have a painful sting.</p>
    <p>Be­fore dawn on Satur­day, a team of work­ers dressed from head to toe in pro­tec­tive suits vac­u­umed the in­sects out of their nest in the cav­ity of a dead tree. “Got ‘em. Vac­u­umed out sev­eral #AsianGiant­Hor­nets from a tree cav­ity near Blaine this morn­ing,” the state agri­cul­ture depart­ment said on Twit­ter later on Satur­day, along with a video show­ing a mass of hor­nets in a trans­par­ent con­tainer.</p>
    <p>It said re­moval of the nest ap­peared to have been suc­cess­ful and more de­tails would be pro­vided at a press con­fer­ence to­day.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists in Wash­ing­ton state have been ac­tively search­ing for the Asian gi­ant hor­net since the first such in­sect was de­tected in De­cem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>The WSDA be­lieves there was a good chance that there are more nests and “stop­ping this cold is very cru­cial”, said en­to­mol­o­gist Sven Spichiger at WSDA dur­ing a press con­fer­ence last Fri­day. “If it be­comes es­tab­lished, this hor­net will have neg­a­tive im­pacts on the en­vi­ron­ment, economy, and public health of Wash­ing­ton State,” the WSDA said.</p>
