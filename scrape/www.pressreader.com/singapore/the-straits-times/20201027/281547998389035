    <p>After weeks of un­cer­tainty, Brunei DPMM fi­nally con­firmed yes­ter­day that they will not de­fend their Sin­ga­pore Pre­mier League (SPL) football ti­tle ow­ing to coro­n­avirus travel curbs. But they hope to be back next sea­son, and the Football As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore looks for­ward to their re­turn.</p>
    <p>After weeks of un­cer­tainty, the Football As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (FAS) con­firmed yes­ter­day that Brunei DPMM will not be back to de­fend their Sin­ga­pore Pre­mier League (SPL) ti­tle this sea­son.</p>
    <p>The FAS said in a state­ment that it was in­formed that DPMM are “un­able to par­tic­i­pate in their up­com­ing fix­tures, be­cause there are cur­rently no pro­vi­sions in Brunei that al­low them to travel to Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>It added: “There is also cur­rently no con­fir­ma­tion as to when travel can re­sume at all, due to the evolv­ing Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion world­wide.”</p>
    <p>The SPL will con­tinue with­out its de­fend­ing cham­pi­ons, said the FAS, so that “the league con­cludes in time in or­der for Sin­ga­pore’s rep­re­sen­ta­tives for 2021’s Asian Football Confederat­ion (AFC) club com­pe­ti­tions to be as­cer­tained”.</p>
    <p>After a seven-month sus­pen­sion due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the SPL re­sumed on Oct 17. While DPMM re­ceived a bye that game week, they missed the Oct 12 dead­line to con­firm their par­tic­i­pa­tion in the nine-team league.</p>
    <p>Their match against Hougang United last Sun­day was then post­poned as they were un­able to travel.</p>
    <p>DPMM gen­eral man­ager Ali Haji Momin said the 2015 and 2019 cham­pi­ons aim to be back for the 2021 sea­son, and added: “We were look­ing for­ward to de­fend­ing our ti­tle this sea­son. How­ever, de­spite our best ef­forts, the travel rules have meant that it is not pos­si­ble for us to do so.</p>
    <p>“We are tremen­dously grate­ful for the pa­tience and kind un­der­stand­ing of the FAS over the last few weeks as we both sought a so­lu­tion to this mat­ter. We wish the other eight teams the best of luck for the rest of this sea­son.”</p>
    <p>DPMM coach Adrian Pen­nock said they are dis­ap­pointed but “re­spect the gov­ern­ment’s reg­u­la­tions be­cause it is best to be safe than sorry”. He added: “That’s it for us this sea­son, and as all of us are on one-year con­tracts un­til the end of the year, we will have to meet the man­age­ment to see where we go from here.”</p>
    <p>DPMM’s with­drawal means the re­sult of the only match they played this sea­son – a 2-0 win over Tampines Rovers at Ban­dar Seri Be­gawan on March 6 – will be voided.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Tampines coach Gavin Lee does not see it as any ad­van­tage even if the other teams no longer have the op­por­tu­nity to go for six points against DPMM.</p>
    <p>Lee said: “It’s a shame they will not be tak­ing part be­cause we would like to play them, but there is a big­ger pic­ture and we un­der­stand the de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>“We can­not be think­ing about what could have been. All our at­ten­tion is on our next game against Al­birex and the games after that.”</p>
    <p>Calling the sit­u­a­tion “un­for­tu­nate”, FAS pres­i­dent Lim Kia Tong is look­ing for­ward to DPMM’s re­turn next year.</p>
    <p>He said: “I am cer­tain SPL sup­port­ers and the other par­tic­i­pat­ing clubs were look­ing for­ward to see the reign­ing cham­pi­ons de­fend their ti­tle.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, we recog­nise that th­ese are ex­tra­or­di­nary cir­cum­stances, and the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion leaves us with ex­tremely lim­ited op­tions. Brunei DPMM has been a val­ued par­tic­i­pant of the SPL for a bet­ter part of the decade and re­mains an in­te­gral part of our league.”</p>
    <p>Thirty-seven games re­main in the re­vised fix­tures list, with teams play­ing each other twice in­stead of thrice for big stakes: a tro­phy, one spot in the AFC Cham­pi­ons League – the con­ti­nent’s top club com­pe­ti­tion – and two berths in the sec­ond-tier AFC Cup.</p>
    <p>NO WAY OUT</p>
    <p>We were look­ing for­ward to de­fend­ing our ti­tle this sea­son. How­ever, de­spite our best ef­forts, the travel rules have meant that it is not pos­si­ble for us to do so.</p>
    <p>ALI HAJI MOMIN, DPMM gen­eral man­ager, on the sit­u­a­tion his side are fac­ing.</p>
