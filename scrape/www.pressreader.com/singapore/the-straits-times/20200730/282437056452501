    <p>IOC V-P ex­presses his be­lief that streamline­d Games will be­come ‘new norm’ for later hosts</p>
    <p>SYD­NEY • The Olympic move­ment faces its big­gest chal­lenge for four decades in get­ting a streamline­d Sum­mer Games up and run­ning next year but in­flu­en­tial of­fi­cial John Coates be­lieves they will take place.</p>
    <p>He heads the In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee’s (IOC) Co­or­di­na­tion Com­mis­sion for the Tokyo Games, which were post­poned be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The 70-year-old Aus­tralian con­cedes that there is un­cer­tainty be­cause of the con­tin­u­ing spread of the virus but thinks it is im­por­tant the Games go ahead next year.</p>
    <p>“We owe it to the ath­letes to make sure this hap­pens and a gen­er­a­tion of ath­letes don’t miss the op</p>
    <p>por­tu­nity of the Games,” the IOC vice-pres­i­dent said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“I’m putting a lot of work into it and my gut feel­ing is yes, we will (have the Olympics next year).”</p>
    <p>While there will be changes to re­duce the cost of the event, and oth­ers to en­sure the health of ath­letes, Coates said the de­sire was still very much to have spec­ta­tors in the sta­di­ums.</p>
    <p>“The crowd is an im­por­tant part of it and it is very much in our plan­ning to maintain that,” he added.</p>
    <p>To off­set the in­crease in costs caused by the post­pone­ment of the Games that were al­ready slated to run up an of­fi­cial bill of US$12.35 bil­lion (S$17 bil­lion), the IOC and the or­gan­is­ers have come up with more than 200 mea­sures to simplify the Olympics.</p>
    <p>One change that was al­ready agreed, he added, was to scrap a glitzy open­ing cer­e­mony for the IOC meet­ing that tra­di­tion­ally pre­cedes the Games.</p>
    <p>“That will now be three speeches at the start of the ses­sion,” said Coates. “And that might save you half a mil­lion dol­lars.”</p>
    <p>He said the sim­pli­fi­ca­tion of the Games was very much in line with IOC pres­i­dent Thomas Bach’s “Agenda 2020”, which aims to make host­ing the Games cheaper af­ter the 2014 Sochi Win­ter Olympics ran up a US$60 bil­lion bill.</p>
    <p>Some of the ad­just­ments for Tokyo might there­fore be­come the “new norm” for host­ing the Olympics, Coates said. He added that since the post­pone­ment, there has been no change in the re­la­tion­ship be­tween the IOC and their</p>
    <p>Tokyo part­ners, from Yoshiro Mori, the for­mer Ja­panese prime min­is­ter who heads the or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee, all the way down.</p>
    <p>Coates noted: “They’ve main­tained their mo­ti­va­tion. I’m very, very im­pressed. This is a chal­lenge they didn’t an­tic­i­pate and they’re just get­ting on with it.”</p>
    <p>He added the IOC was fac­ing its big­gest chal­lenge since 1980, when the United States led a boy­cott of the Moscow Olympics over the Soviet in­va­sion of Afghanista­n.</p>
    <p>While not want­ing to un­der­play the prob­lems, he thought his close ally Bach’s com­mit­ment to over­haul­ing the sta­tus quo would make it eas­ier for the Olympic move­ment to ride out the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“In terms of the chal­lenges I think we’re in a bet­ter po­si­tion be­cause when Bach came in, his mantra was ‘change or be changed’,” he said.</p>
