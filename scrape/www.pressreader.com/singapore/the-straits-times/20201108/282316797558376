    <p>When Jenni (not her real name) heard about her friend’s l avish trips to Europe more than two years ago, she won­dered how she could af­ford it.</p>
    <p>“She told me she was on a sug­ar­dat­ing app,” says the 28-year-old mar­ket­ing ex­ec­u­tive and part-time model, who was born in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Out of cu­rios­ity, she signed up for Su­gar­book – a dat­ing app that pairs “sugar ba­bies” with wealthy men or women, other­wise known as “sugar dad­dies” and “sugar mum­mies” – but not with­out trep­i­da­tion.</p>
    <p>The Kuala Lumpur-based app has 85,000 to 90,000 mem­bers in Sin­ga­pore and about one mil­lion mem­bers world­wide. It was set up in 2017.</p>
    <p>She says: “Of course I had con­cerns go­ing in. What if it’s shady? Do I have to sleep with the sugar dad­dies just be­cause they give me money?”</p>
    <p>More than two years into sugar dat­ing, with three long-term ar­range­ments in which she re­ceived al­lowances from her “dad­dies”, she has set aside most of her con­cerns.</p>
    <p>“When I meet some­one through a tra­di­tional dat­ing app like Tin­der or Tan­tan, there’s no set­ting of ex­pec­ta­tions. I don’t know how it’s go­ing to go and, after a few dates... we end things.</p>
    <p>“That’s such a waste of time. With sugar dat­ing, at least I get com­pen­sated for my time,” she says.</p>
    <p>She gen­er­ally starts with pay-per­meet ses­sions for $400 to $500. She says such dates do not in­clude phys­i­cal in­ti­macy. “I don’t dive straight into sex­ual re­la­tions with some­one new. I may do it in a long-term ar­range­ment though,” she says.</p>
    <p>She has had three long-term, ex­clu­sive ar­range­ments with dif­fer­ent sugar dad­dies. She does not date men who say they are mar­ried or those above the age of 45.</p>
    <p>Her cur­rent sugar daddy, whom she has been see­ing for about five months, is a Sin­ga­porean en­tre­pre­neur in his mid-30s who gives her a monthly al­lowance from $8,000 to $10,000.</p>
    <p>She pre­vi­ously dated an Aus­tralian busi­ness­man who cut her al­lowance to $6,000 from her usual range of $8,000 to $10,000, due to fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties when the pan­demic struck. Soon after, he re­turned to Aus­tralia and the two called off their ar­range­ment.</p>
    <p>Jenni says her al­lowance and salary from her day job add up to around $14,000 a month and she saves about a third of it. She spends the rest on fa­cials, man­i­cures and hol­i­days to Europe and the United States. She also sends money home to her fam­ily in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>She is aware that be­ing a sugar baby is con­tro­ver­sial, with many view­ing it as equiv­a­lent to pros­ti­tu­tion. But she says: “I don’t feel a lot of guilt or any­thing. I don’t think I’m do­ing any­thing wrong or il­le­gal. Sugar ba­bies are not pros­ti­tutes. I think pros­ti­tutes get paid to do what they have to do – they can­not re­ject or say no – whereas if I’ m un­com­fort­able, I can al­ways say no.”</p>
    <p>She tells friends about her sug­ar­dat­ing life, but not her fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“My par­ents and sib­lings don’t know. My par­ents have a pretty tra­di­tional mind­set, so I don’t feel the need to tell them. But if they find out, I’ll be up­front.”</p>
    <p>She tries not to be too emo­tion­ally in­vested in her sugar dad­dies, but is not against a daddy be­com­ing a mar­riage prospect. “Who knows? I may meet Mr Right,” she adds.</p>
    <p>While sugar ba­bies may not iden­tify them­selves as sex work­ers, a sugar-baby pro­file set up by The Sun­day Times on Su­gar­book im­me­di­ately re­ceived of­fers of money in ex­change for sex­ual favours.</p>
    <p>These ranged from $350 for a pay-per-meet ses­sion, with sex in­cluded, to $800 for a meet-up, which in­cludes “all adult needs”.</p>
    <p>Su­gar­book founder Dar­ren Chan, 34, says the app does its best to com­bat ac­tiv­i­ties such as so­lic­i­ta­tion and sex work by hav­ing com­mu­nity mod­er­a­tors prowl the plat­form un­der­cover. The app also bars men­tions of paid sex and nu­dity on mem­bers’ profiles, but he con­cedes that so­lic­i­ta­tion can still oc­cur.</p>
    <p>“These things can hap­pen on any app like Tin­der or In­sta­gram, not just Su­gar­book. And things that oc­cur in pri­vate con­ver­sa­tions are strictly con­fi­den­tial and not up for us to judge,” he says.</p>
    <p>De­spite the stigma of sug­ar­dat­ing be­ing sugar-coated sex work, Su­gar­book has seen a boost dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan, who is Malaysian, says the app now has al­most 90,000 mem­bers here – a 30 per cent in­crease since May, when cir­cuit breaker mea­sures were un­der way. Around 60 per cent of these mem­bers are sugar ba­bies look­ing for ex­tra in­come.</p>
    <p>He says his app, which has more than a mil­lion mem­bers glob­ally, turned a profit late last year.</p>
    <p>A sim­i­lar United States-based sugar-dat­ing app, Seek­ingAr­range­ment, did not re­spond to queries about its user base.</p>
    <p>Most sugar dad­dies on Su­gar­book and Seek­ingAr­range­ment went si­lent when ap­proached by The Sun­day Times for in­ter­views.</p>
    <p>Only James (not his real name) agreed to speak over the Su­gar­book app on con­di­tion of anonymity.</p>
    <p>The 36-year-old di­vorced Malaysian, who is based in Sin­ga­pore in a su­per­vi­sory role at a fac­tory, is on the app as he is lonely and hopes to find a “friends with ben­e­fits” ar­range­ment – a friend­ship which in­cludes sex­ual re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>“That’s bet­ter since we both have our own lives to lead,” he says. “I don’t mind spend­ing some money to make my­self happy.”</p>
    <p>He is eva­sive when asked how much al­lowance he of­fers his sugar ba­bies, but de­clares on his pro­file that he has an an­nual in­come of US$500,000 (S$678,500).</p>
    <p>His ex­pe­ri­ence is not all pos­i­tive, hav­ing met peo­ple he de­scribes as “scam­mers and gold-dig­gers”.</p>
    <p>While in Malaysia, he paid for air tick­ets for sugar ba­bies to fly to Kuala Lumpur to meet him, but they were no-shows.</p>
    <p>Su­gar­book and Seek­ingAr­range­ment ad­vise their mem­bers against en­gag­ing in mone­tary trans­ac­tions on­line be­fore meet­ing.</p>
    <p>When such sugar ar­range­ments go sour, re­course may be sought in court but they are hard to prove, say lawyers in­ter­viewed.</p>
    <p>Crim­i­nal lawyer Ramesh Ti­wary says: “If I agree to pay $500 for a meet-up and in the end, I don’t pay, this could be a breach of con­tract. But the in­for­mal­ity of such agree­ments may make them hard to en­force.”</p>
    <p>Mr Mar­shall Lim, who prac­tises crim­i­nal law, says such a breach of con­tract may be dif­fi­cult to prove in a lo­cal court. Vaguely de­fined terms of what con­sti­tutes phys­i­cal in­ti­macy can also make dis­putes dif­fi­cult to set­tle, es­pe­cially when both par­ties have dif­fer­ing ideas of what the deal en­tails.</p>
    <p>An­other com­plex­ity is that sug­ar­dat­ing apps skirt the edge of sex work, which is le­gal in Sin­ga­pore, al­though re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties such as so­lic­i­ta­tion – the ad­ver­tis­ing of one’s sex­ual ser­vices – are not.</p>
    <p>Mr Ti­wary says: “I think to the male mind, it’s fairly clear on these apps that you can have sex with the women for the right price. Ev­ery­one knows what it en­tails, he or she just doesn’t ver­balise it.”</p>
    <p>With few safe­guards, sugar re­la­tion­ships are vul­ner­a­ble to abuse.</p>
    <p>Ms Vanessa Ho, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of Project X, a non-profit sup­port group for sex work­ers, has en­coun­tered about 10 cases of sugar ba­bies seek­ing help, though the women do not iden­tify as sex work­ers.</p>
    <p>She says: “With sugar ba­bies, there is a greater risk of emo­tional abuse be­cause it is less trans­ac­tional than sex work – there’s more re­la­tion­ship-build­ing and that can ex­pose one to more men­tal abuse.”</p>
    <p>Non-pay­ments, ha­rass­ment, sex­ual as­sault, stalk­ing and dis­re­gard­ing bound­aries laid out are some is­sues faced by the sugar ba­bies who have ap­proached Project X. Many do not take le­gal ac­tion due to the stigma sur­round­ing sugar dat­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Ho says: “Power can man­i­fest it­self in many ways in any re­la­tion­ship and money is one of those ways.</p>
    <p>“In a sugar re­la­tion­ship, the sugar par­ent has fi­nan­cial power over the baby, so the ba­bies need to draw very clear bound­aries for them­selves and have a great sense of self­aware­ness about when those bound­aries are over­stepped.</p>
    <p>“Sugar par­ents can feel own­er­ship over the sugar ba­bies and dis­re­gard bound­aries set. It’s sim­i­lar to what we ob­serve in the sex in­dus­try. They think, ‘I’ve paid, so you have to do what I want.’”</p>
    <p>Most wor­ry­ing to coun­sel­lors is that the Seek­ingAr­range­ment app</p>
    <p>has been woo­ing stu­dents at the ter­tiary level, by of­fer­ing sugar ba­bies who sign up with a “.edu” e-mail ad­dress a free pre­mium ac­count worth US$19.95 (S$27) a month.</p>
    <p>Ms An­drea Chan, head of in­ter­ven­tion at Touch In­te­grated Fam­ily Group, who coun­sels fam­i­lies, chil­dren and youth, says sugar re­la­tion­ships for those be­tween the ages of 18 to 23 can have a great in­flu­ence on their fu­ture re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>“In a con­ven­tional re­la­tion­ship with some­one of a sim­i­lar age, you work through is­sues, you sort out fi­nances. In a sugar re­la­tion­ship, you en­joy the glam­orous life yet you can’t in­vest your feel­ings 100 per cent be­cause it’s sup­posed to be some­what trans­ac­tional,” she says.</p>
    <p>As such, sugar ba­bies are plagued with ques­tions, such as “How much of my­self should I hold back? Is he or she go­ing to find a new sugar baby soon?”, which may lead to dis­cor­dant ex­pec­ta­tions of what a re­la­tion­ship is usu­ally like.</p>
    <p>Such ex­pec­ta­tions may lead to an over-em­pha­sis on money and fi­nan­cial power in ro­mance, a ten­dency to give into de­mands to keep part­ners happy and a more di­min­ished in­ter­est in build­ing a ca­reer.</p>
    <p>Like other coun­sel­lors spo­ken to, she warns that while re­ly­ing on sugar dad­dies might bring ac­cess to lux­u­ries and the good life faster and eas­ier, the longer-term im­pact on those who opt to do so could be less than sweet.</p>
    <p>With sugar ba­bies, there is a greater risk of emo­tional abuse... there’s more re­la­tion­ship-build­ing and that can ex­pose one to more men­tal abuse.</p>

    <p>Sugar par­ents can feel own­er­ship over the sugar ba­bies and dis­re­gard bound­aries set. It’s sim­i­lar to what we ob­serve in the sex in­dus­try. They think, ‘I’ve paid, so you have to do what I want.’</p>
