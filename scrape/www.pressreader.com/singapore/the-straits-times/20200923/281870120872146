    <p>Floods and land­slides have struck In­done­sia’s cap­i­tal Jakarta and its sur­round­ing ar­eas, leav­ing two peo­ple dead, one miss­ing and 20 oth­ers in­jured, of­fi­cials said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A river, hit by tor­ren­tial rain since Mon­day, over­flowed its banks and sub­merged sur­round­ing ar­eas in the cap­i­tal – which has re­cently come un­der par­tial Covid-19 lock­down again, Na­tional Dis­as­ter Man­age­ment Agency spokesman Ra­ditya Jati said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ramli Prase­tio, press of­fi­cer of the Jakarta Search and Res­cue Of­fice, said that in the Suk­abumi district of West Java, two peo­ple were killed in flash floods and one re­mains miss­ing.</p>
    <p>“To­day (Tues­day) two corpses were re­trieved,” he told Xin­hua news agency, adding that a search mis­sion is un­der way.</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of res­cuers have been tak­ing part in the search and res­cue oper­a­tion, in­clud­ing soldiers, the po­lice and those from the Jakarta Search and Res­cue Of­fice, said Mr Ramli.</p>
    <p>He added that the weather con­di­tions have been favourable for the oper­a­tion, and many res­i­dents have taken shel­ter at their rel­a­tives’ homes.</p>
    <p>Mr Ramli said the floods did not cause any ca­su­al­ties in the cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>Mr Jati told Xin­hua that the floods in Jakarta forced 15 per­sons to flee their homes and to take shel­ter on safer grounds, but in the Suk­abumi district, 210 fam­i­lies took shel­ter af­ter the flash floods and land­slides hit the area.</p>
    <p>The dis­as­ter left 20 peo­ple in­jured and se­ri­ously dam­aged nine houses as well as 10 bridges in the district, the spokesman added.</p>
    <p>A warn­ing has been put in place by In­done­sia’s Meterol­ogy, Cli­ma­tol­ogy and Geo­physics Agency over the pos­si­bil­ity of ex­treme weather yes­ter­day and to­day.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents are cau­tioned to be alert to the pos­si­bil­ity of fur­ther floods, flash floods and land­slides as well as whirl­winds, the agency said.</p>
