    <p>• Saudi gi­ants Al Hi­lal ac­cused Asia’s foot­ball body of in­flex­i­bil­ity yes­ter­day af­ter the coronaviru­s-hit ti­tle hold­ers were kicked out of the AFC Cham­pi­ons League for fail­ing to field enough play­ers.</p>
    <p>Al Hi­lal last week man­aged to send a squad for the restart of Asia’s show­piece club tour­na­ment fol­low­ing a six-month hia­tus, but 30 of their play­ers and staff have now con­tracted the virus.</p>
    <p>The side could only name 11 play­ers for Wed­nes­day’s group-stage match in Doha against Shabab Al Ahli of the United Arab Emi­rates (UAE), rather than the re­quired 13, prompt­ing the Asian Foot­ball Con­fed­er­a­tion (AFC) to eject them.</p>
    <p>Al Hi­lal, who had qual­i­fied for the last 16, said they tried their best to re­main in the tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>“The board of di­rec­tors... sought to work on a num­ber of meth­ods that pre­serve Al Hi­lal’s right to com­pete without any dis­or­der to the tour­na­ment,” the club said. “But all these re­quests were re­jected (de­spite) com­pelling cir­cum­stances that re­quire greater flex­i­bil­ity from the AFC.”</p>
    <p>Al Hi­lal had sug­gested their match be post­poned and also called for the knock­out stages, due to be­gin on Sun­day, to be de­layed. They had also of­fered to for­feit their match against Shabab, but not their place in the tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>An­nounc­ing the de­ci­sion, the AFC said it had re­jected the re­quest for a post­pone­ment as it “would have a huge neg­a­tive im­pact” on the match sched­ule.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials are rush­ing to com­plete the com­pe­ti­tion be­fore the end of the year, with a sin­gle-legged fi­nal now due to take place on Dec 19.</p>
    <p>Asked whether they were con­cerned about the grow­ing num­ber of cases, the AFC said they had taken suf­fi­cient pre­cau­tions at the Qatar hub where West Asia group matches are be­ing staged.</p>
    <p>“Bio-se­cure bub­bles” had been cre­ated for play­ers and staff and they were be­ing reg­u­larly tested, while new bub­bles had been set up for the me­dia and se­cu­rity of­fi­cials, the body said.</p>
    <p>“There has been no trans­mis­sion of Covid-19 be­tween two com­pet­ing teams through­out the matches,” it added in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“AFC will con­tinue to do ev­ery­thing in its power to min­imise the trans­mis­sion of Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>Al Hi­lal drew 0-0 against Iran’s Shahr Kho­dro on Sun­day, with coach Raz­van Lucescu call­ing up play­ers from the youth team as sub­sti­tutes. Al Wahda’s campaign also ended in the group stage due to Covid-19 as the UAE side failed to travel to Qatar af­ter sev­eral pos­i­tive tests.</p>
