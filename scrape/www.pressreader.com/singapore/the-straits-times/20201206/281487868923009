    <p>A prop­erty de­vel­oper is build­ing a lux­ury con­do­minium in Gey­lang around two ter­raced houses af­ter their own­ers re­fused to sell their free­hold prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>When the NoMa con­do­minium in Guille­mard Road is com­pleted in 2023, one of the two houses will be hemmed in on three sides by the 50-unit de­vel­op­ment. The other will be wedged be­tween NoMa and the ex­ist­ing La Brisa con­do­minium along Lorong 28 Gey­lang.</p>
    <p>The own­ers of the two houses will find them­selves in a sit­u­a­tion sim­i­lar to that of the el­derly wid­ower in the an­i­mated film Up who re­fuses to move from the fam­ily home as high-rise build­ings come up around the neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>In Gey­lang, prop­erty de­vel­oper Ma­cly Group wanted to ac­quire all seven two-storey ter­raced houses in the vicin­ity to build the free­hold project.</p>
    <p>But it man­aged to se­cure only five of them, re­port­edly for a sum of about $20.55 mil­lion, a few years ago. The five free­hold prop­er­ties – 331, 333, 335 and 339 Guille­mard Road and 56 Lorong 28 Gey­lang – sit on a to­tal land area of 12,839 sq ft.</p>
    <p>Ma­cly Group, which calls it­self a pioneer in the “shoe­box apart­ment” field in Sin­ga­pore, told The Sun­day Times that it had ini­tially planned for a slightly larger project.</p>
    <p>If it had se­cured all seven prop­er­ties in the clus­ter, the com­pany could have of­fered more units in NoMa con­do­minium.</p>
    <p>When the own­ers of the two hold­outs – 337 Guille­mard Road and 54 Lorong 28 Gey­lang – re­fused to sell, the de­vel­oper worked closely with the ar­chi­tects to de­sign three dis­tinct blocks – North, East and West – around the un­usual site. The blocks have their own gate ac­cess and lifts.</p>
    <p>“This al­lowed us to turn some­thing seem­ingly neg­a­tive into a (unique sell­ing propo­si­tion),” Ma­cly Group said, ad­ding that the de­sign plans “changed quite dras­ti­cally”.</p>
    <p>The prop­erty de­vel­oper de­cided to push ahead with the project launch, believ­ing that NoMa’s de­sign would ap­peal to buy­ers.</p>
    <p>As of Fri­day af­ter­noon, 46 of 50 units have been snapped up. Prices range from about $700,000 for a one-bed­room unit to around $2 mil­lion for a four-bed­room one.</p>
    <p>When this re­porter vis­ited the Guille­mard Road house on Thurs­day, a man in it de­clined to be in­ter­viewed. The prop­erty is a Bud­dhist prayer hall open only to the owner’s fam­ily and friends, said Shin Min Daily News, which quoted a care­taker as say­ing she did not know why the owner did not want to sell it.</p>
    <p>At the Lorong 28 Gey­lang prop­erty, a mid­dle-aged man re­sid­ing there asked for his pri­vacy to be re­spected.</p>
    <p>“If my neigh­bours want to sell their homes, that’s their de­ci­sion,” he said, dis­clos­ing that he had lived in the house for many years.</p>
    <p>He added: “Where can you get such a house in a good lo­ca­tion?”</p>
    <p>The man also noted that sev­eral years ago, he had re­fused to sell his prop­erty to the de­vel­oper that later built the next-door La Brisa con­do­minium.</p>
    <p>The open area in front of his two­s­torey house, which is a long rec­tan­gu­lar piece of land, has been turned into a gar­den in which he keeps birds and fish. The rear opens into a back al­ley.</p>
    <p>The landed prop­erty at Lorong 28 Gey­lang can fetch at least $4 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>A quick check around the area shows it is a mish-mash of run­down ter­raced houses and small mod­ern condo devel­op­ments of­fer­ing shoe­box units.</p>
    <p>De­spite the con­struc­tion work around the two ter­race houses, the oc­cu­pants did not seem both­ered by the noise or the pres­ence of work­ers and heavy ve­hi­cles at their doorsteps.</p>
    <p>When The Sun­day Times vis­ited the site last week, the roofs of both hold­outs had sound bar­rier sheets on them.</p>
    <p>The one fac­ing Guille­mard Road, in par­tic­u­lar, stood awk­wardly in the mid­dle of the con­struc­tion site with hoard­ings en­velop­ing it on three sides. The other five houses have been torn down.</p>
    <p>NoMa con­do­minium – which con­sists of two five-storey blocks and an­other with eight-storeys – will have one-, two- and four-bed­room units.</p>
    <p>When asked if it will even­tu­ally of­fer a bet­ter price to ac­quire the two houses around NoMa, Ma­cly Group said: “No, as our cur­rent plans are ap­proved and sold to buy­ers. We are pro­ceed­ing as per sta­tus quo.”</p>
    <p>NOT BUDG­ING</p>
    <p>If my neigh­bours want to sell their homes, that’s their de­ci­sion... Where can you get such a house in a good lo­ca­tion?’’</p>
