    <p>In the con­text of a pan­demic that has killed about 190,000</p>
    <p>Amer­i­cans and eco­nom­i­cally dev­as­tated many mil­lions more, get­ting into the col­lege of your dreams is a bou­tique con­cern. But for many teenagers who have or­gan­ised their school years around that goal, it’s ev­ery­thing.</p>
    <p>And it’s go­ing to be dif­fer­ent this ad­mis­sion sea­son. It may well be dif­fer­ent for­ever more.</p>
    <p>That was what I con­cluded af­ter a re­cent se­ries of con­ver­sa­tions with Mr Jef­frey Selingo, whose widely an­tic­i­pated new book, Who Gets In And Why: A Year In­side Col­lege Ad­mis­sions, will be pub­lished on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Selingo was given ex­tra­or­di­nary ac­cess to the se­lec­tion process and the se­lec­tors at Emory Univer­sity, David­son Col­lege and the Univer­sity of Wash­ing­ton. He uses it in his book to present one of the most nu­anced, cool-headed ex­am­i­na­tions of the ad­mis­sion process that I’ve read. He ex­plodes cer­tain myths – for ex­am­ple, that Scholas­tic As­sess­ment Test (SAT) and Amer­i­can Col­lege Test­ing (ACT) scores are ab­so­lutely piv­otal – and con­firms other sus­pi­cions, such as the ridicu­lous ad­van­tage con­ferred on mid­dling stu­dents who play ar­cane sports.</p>
    <p>But his knowl­edge and in­sights also put him in an ex­cel­lent po­si­tion to spec­u­late on mat­ters be­yond the book’s bounds: specif­i­cally, the lit­tle, big, tem­po­rary and per­ma­nent ways in which the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, which dawned af­ter his re­search was done, will change the way col­leges eval­u­ate stu­dents and vice versa.</p>
    <p>“Col­lege ad­mis­sions is never go­ing to be the same,” he told me.</p>
    <p>He was fo­cus­ing on se­lec­tive schools, which ed­u­cate a small mi­nor­ity of Amer­i­cans in col­lege but loom mon­strously large in the psy­ches of many high school stu­dents, who in­tri­cately game out how to breach these exclusive sanc­tums. Well, the rules of that game just changed.</p>
    <p>Mr Selingo pre­dicts that many schools that al­low “early de­ci­sion” ap­pli­ca­tions, with which a stu­dent sets his or her sights on one pre­ferred in­sti­tu­tion and com­mits to at­tend­ing it if ac­cepted, will fill more of their slots that way than ever, mean­ing that these ap­pli­ca­tions will have bet­ter odds of suc­cess than ones sub­mit­ted later. Schools leaned ex­tra hard on early de­ci­sion in the shadow of the</p>
    <p>Great Re­ces­sion, he said, and now face the same eco­nomic anx­i­ety, the same mo­ti­va­tion to fig­ure out as soon as pos­si­ble which new stu­dents will be ar­riv­ing and how much fi­nan­cial aid they’ll need.</p>
    <p>But a more broadly con­se­quen­tial change in­volves stan­dard­ised tests. Be­cause the pan­demic pre­vented stu­dents last spring from gath­er­ing to take the SAT and ACT ex­ams, many se­lec­tive schools are not re­quir­ing them for the time be­ing. That will force them to fo­cus more than ever on the tough­ness of the high school cour­ses that stu­dents took and the grades they got.</p>
    <p>Which stu­dents will ben­e­fit from that? It’s com­pli­cated. On one hand, af­flu­ent stu­dents who are coached for these ex­ams and usu­ally take them re­peat­edly won’t get to flaunt their high scores. On the other hand, less-priv­i­leged stu­dents from high schools whose aca­demic rigour is a ques­tion mark in screen­ers’ minds won’t have im­pres­sive scores to prove their met­tle.</p>
    <p>While these ex­ams have been blamed for per­pet­u­at­ing in­equal­ity, they in some cases play the op­po­site role. In fact, a spe­cial com­mit­tee of ed­u­ca­tors in the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia sys­tem pro­duced an ex­haus­tively de­tailed re­port this year that de­ter­mined that the use of SATs in ad­mis­sions had not less­ened di­ver­sity and that SAT scores were use­ful pre­dic­tors of col­lege suc­cess. (Univer­sity lead­ers elected to switch to test-op­tional ad­mis­sions for a few years any­way.)</p>
    <p>The SAT’s down­grade won’t be fleet­ing, Mr Selingo said. “We’re go­ing to have a whole ad­mis­sions year with scores of places go­ing test-op­tional,” he said. “Once their world doesn’t come crash­ing down and they still re­cruit a class, those col­leges are not go­ing to flock back to the test. I think it’s been knocked off the pedestal per­ma­nently.”</p>
    <p>He makes the same guess about what he calls “ap­pli­ca­tion bloat”, re­fer­ring to the flam­boy­ant mul­ti­plic­ity of clubs, causes, hob­bies and other ma­te­ri­als that ap­pli­cants as­sem­ble and show­case. The pan­demic put many of those ac­tiv­i­ties on hold, cre­at­ing a pause in which he be­lieves that some schools and some stu­dents will recog­nise the lu­nacy of this overkill.</p>
    <p>“It’s go­ing to be dif­fi­cult for stu­dents to fill in 10 spa­ces for ex­tracur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­i­ties, flag down teach­ers for rec­om­men­da­tions or take six (Ad­vanced Place­ment) cour­ses and ex­ams,” he said. “Ad­mis­sions of­fi­cers are go­ing to have to fo­cus on what mat­ters. That means in the fu­ture they can pare back the ap­pli­ca­tion and re­duce our col­lec­tive anx­i­ety about what it takes to get into col­lege.”</p>
    <p>Apart from the in­creased early de­ci­sion em­pha­sis, which can favour in-the-know kids from in-clover fam­i­lies, the changes that Mr Selingo pre­dicts rep­re­sent a back-to-ba­sics stream­lin­ing of the process. It may have been born of ter­ri­ble cir­cum­stances, but it’s also sen­si­ble and over­due.</p>
    <p>That stream­lin­ing ex­tends to how stu­dents will choose schools dur­ing the com­ing ad­mis­sion cy­cle. For epi­demi­o­log­i­cal and eco­nomic rea­sons, many of them will forgo all the cam­pus tours and all the as­sess­ments of how comfy the dor­mi­to­ries seem, how tasty the food is, how high the spires rise and how lushly the trees grow. They’ll per­haps look more closely at the course cat­a­logue, the ros­ter of pro­fes­sors.</p>
    <p>Mr Selingo noted that many col­leges based a big part of their sales pitch on their phys­i­cal set­ting and even on life­style and so­cial perks that are less rel­e­vant than ever, given pan­demic-re­lated re­stric­tions. “That’s forc­ing par­ents and stu­dents to ask, ‘What are we re­ally pay­ing for?’ ” he said.</p>
    <p>The an­swer is, or should be, an ed­u­ca­tion, and stu­dents may come to re­alise that ex­cel­lent ones can be ob­tained at col­leges that are less ex­pen­sive than oth­ers in their sights and closer to home. The lure of go­ing far away to col­lege may di­min­ish.</p>
    <p>What I sus­pect will hap­pen, at least in the short term, is that stu­dents’ think­ing about col­leges will be less emo­tional and more prac­ti­cal. The pan­demic has soured the ro­mance.</p>
    <p>Col­leges had pre­vi­ously pre­sented them­selves to stu­dents as nur­tur­ing homes away from home, then had to send those stu­dents pack­ing when the virus spread. Col­leges were end­less par­ties, then the par­ty­ing stopped. They touted the in­ti­ma­cies of class­room in­struc­tion, then had to de­fend the tu­ition-wor­thy ef­fec­tive­ness of re­mote learn­ing. How can stu­dents not feel some scep­ti­cism in the wake of all that?</p>
    <p>“This morn­ing I lis­tened to a Planet Money pod­cast called The Old Rules Were Dumb Any­way,” Mr Selingo said. “It talked about the rules that went out the win­dow be­cause of the pan­demic and which changes might be here to stay: al­co­hol take­out from restau­rants, telemedici­ne, us­ing nurs­ing cre­den­tials across state lines.”</p>
    <p>He added: “It got me to think­ing about the old rules that were dumb in ad­mis­sions.” And it got him to won­der­ing how many were gone for good.</p>
