    <p>Some 8,750 Mus­lims will be able to per­form their Hari Raya Haji prayers at 65 mosques across Sin­ga­pore this week, although the Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore (Muis) con­tin­ues to en­cour­age fam­i­lies to con­duct prayers at home.</p>
    <p>Hari Raya Haji this year falls on this Fri­day, July 31.</p>
    <p>The lim­ited spa­ces will al­low con­gre­gants to per­form their Hari Raya prayers safely in three morn­ing ses­sions that day, in ad­di­tion to ses­sions sched­uled for weekly Fri­day prayers, Muis said.</p>
    <p>Reg­is­tra­tion for Hari Raya prayers will be open via the Mus­limSG app and our­mosques.com­mon­spaces.sg from 1pm to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Reg­is­tra­tion for Fri­day prayers</p>
    <p>Pro­ceeds from last week­end’s sale of Sin­ga­pore Demo­cratic Al­liance (SDA) posters, which were put up dur­ing the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion, went to The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The sale raised about $5,000, and SDA chief Des­mond Lim topped it up with $5,000 for a to­tal do­na­tion of $10,000 to the fund. “The posters are items that would be dis­posed of, so why not cut wastage and help the needy?” Mr Lim said.</p>
    <p>The posters drew at­ten­tion af­ter they were put up for the polls, be­will open on the same plat­forms on Tues­day at 10am.</p>
    <p>The Of­fice of the Mufti has said that those who can­not se­cure slots in the mosques can, in an ar­range­ment sim­i­lar to that of Hari Raya Aidil­fitri in May, still per­form their Hari Raya prayers at home.</p>
    <p>Muis said those who are able to se­cure a slot for Hari Raya prayers will not need to per­form Fri­day prayers, de­spite the opin­ion of most schol­ars from the Shafi’i, Hanafi and Ma­liki schools of thought that Fri­day prayers are still com­pul­sory af­ter Hari Raya prayers.</p>
    <p>“The Of­fice of the Mufti has ad­vised that this opin­ion is best ap­plied dur­ing nor­mal sit­u­a­tions where space and other sim­i­lar lim­i­ta­tions are not an is­sue,” Muis said.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, those who se­cure a slot for Fri­day prayers on July 31 cause of their use of graph­ics to high­light what the party con­sid­ered were so­cial ills in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>One poster, for ex­am­ple, had the slo­gan “Enough is enough” in the four of­fi­cial lan­guages and in Hokkien. It also de­picted a fist with icons rep­re­sent­ing hous­ing, trans­port and ed­u­ca­tion squeez­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Another poster showed se­niors clear­ing away plates and push­ing card­board boxes.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity law don Eu­gene Tan noted that the use of graph­ics and il­lus­tra­tions on elec­tion posters was not new in Sin­ga­pore, but they had not been used much since the 1960s. will not be able to book a slot for Hari Raya prayers.</p>
    <p>This will al­low more peo­ple to pray in the mosques that day.</p>
    <p>“The main pri­or­ity for the Mus­lim com­mu­nity is to pro­vide op­por­tu­ni­ties for as many Mus­lims as pos­si­ble to per­form Fri­day prayers, es­pe­cially those who have not been able to per­form them since the resumption of Fri­day prayers in mosques (since June 26),” Muis said.</p>
    <p>Those who have per­formed Fri­day prayers in a mosque prior to July 31 will not be el­i­gi­ble to reg­is­ter for Fri­day prayers on that day, although this does not af­fect their el­i­gi­bil­ity for Hari Raya prayer slots.</p>
    <p>Hari Raya Haji, or the feast of the sac­ri­fice, com­mem­o­rates Prophet Ibrahim’s, or Abra­ham’s, trust in Al­lah. This is re­counted in the story of Al­lah com­mand­ing him to sac­ri­fice</p>
    <p>Those who are able to se­cure a slot for Hari Raya prayers will not need to per­form Fri­day prayers, de­spite the opin­ion of most schol­ars from the Shafi’i, Hanafi and Ma­liki schools of thought that Fri­day prayers are still com­pul­sory af­ter Hari Raya prayers. Con­versely, those who se­cure a slot for Fri­day prayers on July 31 will not be able to book a slot for Hari Raya prayers.</p>
    <p>“So, this re­vival is re­fresh­ing and elec­tion art will likely catch on.”</p>
    <p>He added that the SDA’s posters high­lighted “in a very ac­ces­si­ble way, the is­sues the party was cam­paign­ing on in the elec­tion”.</p>
    <p>“The SDA posters are a breath of fresh air, and with taste­ful art­work and graph­ics and sharp mes­sages, they help to re­in­force the SDA mes­sag­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Ul­ti­mately, it is about putting a party’s key mes­sages across as ef­fec­tively as pos­si­ble – a poster with faces of can­di­dates doesn’t go very far to­wards that end.”</p>
    <p>The SDA also made head­lines in the 2015 elec­tion with posters that bore snappy slo­gans op­pos­ing the poli­cies of the rul­ing Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party.</p>
    <p>For this year’s elec­tion, the SDA his son, to which he re­sponded with obe­di­ence be­fore Al­lah stopped him. It also marks the end of the haj, the an­nual Mus­lim pil­grim­age to Mecca in Saudi Ara­bia.</p>
    <p>The Hari Raya Haji ser­mon by Mufti Nazirudin Mohd Nasir will be broad­cast in Malay with English sub­ti­tles on on­line chan­nel SalamSG TV and on Me­di­a­corp Ra­dio Warna 94.2FM at 8.30am.</p>
    <p>Tamil ver­sions will be broad­cast via the Face­book plat­forms of Masjid Ja­mae Chu­lia and Masjid AlAbrar and on Bisme Is­lamic Ra­dio, while Masjid Mal­abar will broad­cast the ser­mon in Malay­alam.</p>
    <p>At 9.30am, the ser­mon will be de­liv­ered in Ben­gali on SalamSG TV.</p>
    <p>SalamSG TV and Warna will also broad­cast the tak­bir, the ex­al­ta­tion and praise to Al­lah, be­fore the Hari Raya Haji prayer. con­tested in Pasir Ris-Pung­gol GRC, se­cur­ing 23.67 per cent of the vote. The PAP won the con­test with 64.15 per cent, and third con­tender</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus cast its long shadow over Hari Raya Aidil­fitri cel­e­bra­tions in May, with the tra­di­tional recita­tion of prayers con­fined to homes and large gath­er­ings dis­al­lowed. In his ser­mon then, Dr Nazirudin said Mus­lims had to adapt in or­der to con­tinue their re­li­gious prac­tices.</p>
    <p>Muis said those above the age of 60, those with acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tions and pre-ex­ist­ing chronic med­i­cal con­di­tions, as well as chil­dren be­low the age of 12 should still re­frain from go­ing to the mosques.</p>
    <p>Con­gre­gants are also ad­vised to fol­low safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, bring their own prayer items, wear a mask and use the SafeEn­try dig­i­tal check-in sys­tem when en­ter­ing and ex­it­ing mosques.</p>
