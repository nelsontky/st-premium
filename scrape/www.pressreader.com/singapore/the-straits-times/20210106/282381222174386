    <p>• Pre­mier League foot­ball and other forms of elite pro­fes­sional sport in Eng­land will be al­lowed to con­tinue de­spite new na­tional lock­down re­stric­tions an­nounced by the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Un­der Tier 5 re­stric­tions, nearly 56 mil­lion peo­ple in Eng­land will re­turn to a full lock­down, pos­si­bly un­til the mid­dle of next month, to try to cut spi­ralling in­fec­tion rates, Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son said in a tele­vised ad­dress.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures, which in­clude the clo­sure of pri­mary and sec­ondary schools, will come into ef­fect to­day, he said af­ter Scot­land an­nounced sim­i­lar mea­sures which came into force yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a list of ex­emp­tions pub­lished by the United King­dom gov­ern­ment al­lows for “elite sports­peo­ple (and their coaches if nec­es­sary, or par­ents/guardians if they are un­der 18) – or those on an of­fi­cial elite sports path­way – to com­pete and train”.</p>
    <p>One key point in de­ter­min­ing whether a sport­ing com­pe­ti­tion can go ahead will be if it has, as the Pre­mier League does, a test­ing regime and the pro­vi­sion of bio-se­cure bub­bles i n place, while all matches will con­tinue to be played be­hind closed doors.</p>
    <p>Be­fore Mr John­son’s an­nounce­ment, Eng­land Net­ball an­nounced that its home se­ries with Ja­maica, sched­uled for later this month, had been post­poned be­cause of in­ter­na­tional travel re­stric­tions be­tween Bri­tain and the Caribbean is­land.</p>
    <p>A lock­down sim­i­lar to the one in­tro­duced in Eng­land last March as a re­sult of a ris­ing num­ber of Covid-19 cases means out­door gyms, golf cour­ses and ten­nis courts will close, with am­a­teur out­door team sports pro­hib­ited.</p>
    <p>The UK is strug­gling to cope with a new and faster spread­ing vari­ant of Covid-19, first iden­ti­fied in the coun­try last month and said to be 70 per cent more trans­mis­si­ble.</p>
