    <p>PARIS • The French health min­istry re­ported 3,304 new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions on Tues­day, well be­low daily highs seen last week, though greater num­bers of young adults are test­ing pos­i­tive, many without show­ing symp­toms.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new in­fec­tions was above the 1,995 re­ported on Mon­day but re­mained well be­low Sun­day’s new post-lock­down record of 4,897 and be­low lev­els above 3,600 re­ported in the sec­ond half of last week.</p>
    <p>The cu­mu­la­tive to­tal rose to 248,158, along with 30,544 deaths, while the num­ber of peo­ple in hospi­tal with Covid-19 fell by 90 to a new post-lock­down low of 4,600.</p>
    <p>The tally of peo­ple in in­ten­sive care rose by 11 to 410, and is back to lev­els last seen at end-July, but re­mains far be­low the high of more than 7,000 in early April.</p>
    <p>Epi­demi­ol­o­gists say the rel­a­tively lim­ited pres­sure on hos­pi­tals is due to the fact that the virus now cir­cu­lates ac­tively among younger peo­ple, who typ­i­cally show fewer or no symp­toms of the res­pi­ra­tory dis­ease.</p>
    <p>But in­creased in­fec­tions among young adults are be­gin­ning to show in hospi­tal statis­tics, the health min­istry said in its lat­est re­view. The num­ber of peo­ple un­der 40 hos­pi­talised for Covid-19 has more than dou­bled to 18 per cent since early last month, com­pared to about 8 per cent from Fe­bru­ary to July, min­istry data showed. About 13 per cent of pa­tients in in­ten­sive care were younger than 40, up from 7 per cent in the spring.</p>
    <p>Inserm re­search in­sti­tute’s epi­demi­ol­o­gist Do­minique Costagli­ola said France needed to re­main vig­i­lant. “It is hard to imag­ine the virus re­main­ing con­fined among the young... The more it cir­cu­lates among young peo­ple, the big­ger the chance it will jump to older peo­ple,” she said.</p>
    <p>France will not let its guard down but life must re­turn to some kind of nor­mal­ity, Prime Min­is­ter Jean Cas­tex said yes­ter­day, as a se­nior ad­viser to the gov­ern­ment warned of a sec­ond wave in Novem­ber.</p>
