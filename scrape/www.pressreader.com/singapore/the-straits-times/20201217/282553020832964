    <p>WON­DER WOMAN 1984</p>
    <p>PG, 151 min­utes, opens today</p>
    <p>The first movie, Won­der Woman (2017), fea­tured Gal Gadot’s ti­tle char­ac­ter, but there was also an aw­ful lot of Chris Pine’s Steve Trevor. In par­tic­u­lar, the un­earned ro­mance be­tween the two that ig­nores the rule laid out in Frozen (2013): Never fall in love with the first man you meet. It gave the movie a Diana Prince-shaped hole (Prince be­ing her se­cret civil­ian iden­tity), as if she did not ex­ist as a per­son be­fore she fell in love.</p>
    <p>Diana is a DC Comics char­ac­ter who is the fe­male equiv­a­lent of Marvel’s Thor (2011) – born with god-like pow­ers, she lacks a mov­ing ori­gin story. So in the 2017 film, they gave her a Thor plot: She falls in love with hu­man­ity through fall­ing in love with one hu­man, then fights a foe from her “old coun­try”.</p>
    <p>Just as the Thor movies got more in­ter­est­ing, the same is hap­pen­ing here.</p>
    <p>The won­der­ful thing about DC Comics movies in­volv­ing char­ac­ters such as Joker, Shazam, Aqua­man and, of course, Su­per­man and Bat­man is the rel­a­tive ab­sence of fan-ser­vice mythol­ogy that needs to be re­gur­gi­tated. The story kicks off cleanly and, best of all, quickly.</p>
    <p>The movie opens with a brief scene-set­ting ac­tion se­quence that shows di­rec­tor Patty Jenk­ins (who also di­rected the first film) to be a mas­ter of tone-blend­ing.</p>
    <p>Diana’s bat­tle with rob­bers in a mall com­bines com­edy, breath­less ac­tion, 1980s scene-set­ting and, for good mea­sure, her stand­ing as a fe­male role model. That last bit could have been cheesy, but the sense of amaze­ment felt by a girl in see­ing a woman toss men around is so slickly done, it is hard not to feel the child’s won­der­ment and pride.</p>
    <p>It also be­comes ap­par­ent why the movie sur­rounds Diana with a strong en­sem­ble cast.</p>
    <p>Gadot is an ac­tress of lim­ited range, a beau­ti­ful blank, and needs more ver­sa­tile play­ers such as Pine and Kris­ten Wiig close by. Wiig, in par­tic­u­lar, is a com­edy sa­vant who can turn on the pathos.</p>
    <p>In this story, a vari­a­tion of The Mon­key’s Paw tale in which vil­lain Maxwell Lord (Pe­dro Pas­cal) gives out wishes as part of his plot to con­trol the world, Wiig’s sad-funny pow­ers and Pine’s abil­ity to emote are put to bril­liant use.</p>
    <p>There has been much said on so­cial me­dia about how this movie speaks to the times (Lord, for ex­am­ple, is a grift­ing tele­vi­sion per­son­al­ity who lies his way to the top), but not enough about its raw emo­tional power.</p>
    <p>In a bold move that pays off strongly, Jenk­ins builds the story to a cli­max that is less about an all-out bat­tle than hav­ing a cathar­tic cry.</p>
    <p>WIFE OF A SPY</p>
    <p>PG13, 115 min­utes, show­ing ex­clu­sively at The Pro­jec­tor</p>
    <p>It is 1940. Ja­panese forces have rav­aged China, but war with the Western pow­ers has yet to break out. In the city of Kobe, pros­per­ous busi­ness­man Mr Fukuhara (Issey Taka­hashi) is liv­ing the good life.</p>
    <p>In a time of ris­ing xeno­pho­bia, the Europhile wears Western clothes, fills his villa with Western fur­ni­ture and spurns lo­cal whiskey in favour of im­ported brands. He meets openly with Bri­tish friends.</p>
    <p>Not only is he blithely dis­mis­sive of the war para­noia grip­ping the na­tion, but he also uses his re­sources to make am­a­teur films, casting his wife Sa­toko (Yu Aoi) as the fear­less hero­ine. Her child­hood friend, po­lice of­fi­cer Ya­suharu (Masahiro Hi­gashide), shields them from of­fi­cial dis­ap­proval, but for how long should the cou­ple tempt fate?</p>
    <p>The dap­per, mild-man­nered Fukuhara seems like an un­likely hero at first. Then, in a bold sto­ry­telling move, his wife Sa­toko be­comes the fo­cus of the story.</p>
    <p>Her char­ac­ter growth, from quiet side­kick to some­one much more will­ing to take ac­tion, is the chief con­cern of di­rec­tor and co-writer Kiyoshi Kuro­sawa, whose long ca­reer has been marked mainly by thrillers.</p>
    <p>For this work, ex­plor­ing the way se­crets shape a mar­riage, Kuro­sawa won the Sil­ver Lion for Best Di­rec­tor at this year’s Venice Film Fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>This is the work of some­one in mas­ter­ful con­trol of at­mos­phere. Kuro­sawa steers clear of the sepia-tinged pal­ette and vis­ual soft­ness that seem oblig­a­tory for wartime dra­mas, in­stead opt­ing for a clean, mat­ter-of-fact look.</p>
    <p>The need for frank­ness be­comes ap­par­ent when the plot takes a turn.</p>
    <p>Mild in­trigue gives way to some­thing re­sem­bling hor­ror af­ter the Fukuha­ras be­come em­broiled in the ac­tiv­i­ties of the Ja­panese forces in Manchuria.</p>
    <p>With­out show­ing gore yet elic­it­ing real chills, Kuro­sawa brings view­ers into the ghastly se­cret that binds hus­band and wife to­gether, one that could end their lives if dis­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s wartime ac­tiv­i­ties in Asia, much less its atroc­i­ties, are al­most never men­tioned in Ja­panese films, so this work, in its own quiet way, breaks new ground.</p>
    <p>THE PROM</p>
    <p>R21, 133 min­utes, show­ing on Net­flix, not re­viewed</p>
    <p>Meryl Streep, James Cor­den and Nicole Kid­man star in this mu­si­cal adapted from a Broad­way pro­duc­tion. Two self-ob­sessed ac­tors, played by Cor­den and Streep, hatch a plan to re­ha­bil­i­tate their pub­lic images, by trav­el­ling to a small town to help high-school­ers fight a ban on their prom be­cause one fe­male stu­dent wants to take along a girl as her date.</p>
    <p>NOT MY MOTHER’S BAK­ING</p>
    <p>NC16, 112 min­utes, show­ing ex­clu­sively at Film­garde Cine­plexes, not re­viewed</p>
    <p>This Sin­ga­pore ro­man­tic com­edy was not made by any of the ma­jor lo­cal la­bels, but by the up-and-com­ing Stu­dio59 Con­cepts. Cre­ated to send a mes­sage of har­mony, it de­tails the plight of Sarah, a Malay-Mus­lim baker who falls in love with Ed­win, whose fam­ily runs a roast pork stall. It stars Sarah Arif­fin, Siti Mas­tura Alwi, Vin­cent Tee, Zack Zainal and Christina Hon.</p>
