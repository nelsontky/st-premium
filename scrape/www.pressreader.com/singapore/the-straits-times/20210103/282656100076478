    <p>Mr Brett Howell, a pro­gramme man­ager at Coca-Cola in At­lanta, Ge­or­gia, has found a way to use his small fam­ily foun­da­tion to take on en­vi­ron­ment is­sues that have a big im­pact.</p>
    <p>He was one of the lead­ers of a 2019 project to clean up Hen­der­son Is­land, an atoll in the South Pa­cific that has the high­est con­cen­tra­tion of plas­tic pol­lu­tion in the world. The is­land, a United Na­tions world his­tor­i­cal site, is un­in­hab­ited but sits in the mid­dle of a cur­rent that car­ries ocean de­bris.</p>
    <p>Mr Howell also started a process of work­ing with other or­gan­i­sa­tions to fig­ure out how to keep the plas­tic from fill­ing up the beach again. Sure, peo­ple can re­cy­cle, maybe dial back the ther­mo­stat to save heat. But even gov­ern­ments with un­lim­ited re­sources strug­gle to take mean­ing­ful steps.</p>
    <p>Yet some smaller foun­da­tions, like the Howell Con­ser­va­tion Fund, are try­ing to chal­lenge this nar­ra­tive and fo­cus their en­ergy and re­sources on one small area of the en­vi­ron­ment in the hope that it will have a ma­jor im­pact.</p>
    <p>“Phi­lan­thropy is so much more than money,” said Mr Henry Ber­man, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Ex­po­nent Phi­lan­thropy, which works with small foun­da­tions.</p>
    <p>He said: “Re­la­tion­ships, ex­per­tise, pulling peo­ple to­gether – these are all parts of the puzzle to make things work. You don’t have to be Bill Gates or Mike Bloomberg to make it work.”</p>
    <p>Mr Howell con­trib­uted just 10 per cent of the 2019 op­er­a­tion’s US$300,000 (S$396,900) cost. But he brought peo­ple to­gether with more money and dif­fer­ent ex­per­tise. “If you’re hy­per­fo­cused,</p>
    <p>you can punch above your weight,” he pointed out.</p>
    <p>Smaller foun­da­tions have of­ten found that they have to take a role in bring­ing to­gether other in­ter­ested groups of all sizes.</p>
    <p>The Camp­bell Foun­da­tion, which is based in Bal­ti­more, has fo­cused on the poor health of the Ch­e­sa­peake Bay for over 20 years. Last year, it made US$18 mil­lion in grants to some 200 or­gan­i­sa­tions, but it also reg­u­larly brings to­gether the var­i­ous in­ter­ests around the wa­ter­way, in­clud­ing farm­ers, fish­er­men and con­ser­va­tion­ists. One big is­sue has been the run-off into the wa­ter from chicken waste.</p>
    <p>“It’s me go­ing around and meet­ing peo­ple,” said Ms Sarah Camp­bell, pres­i­dent of the foun­da­tion, which her fa­ther started. “That kind of ef­fort to hear all sides re­ally counts,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I say it’s not just con­ser­va­tion for con­ser­va­tion’s sake,” she added. “It’s about the ben­e­fits to peo­ple of a healthy en­vi­ron­ment.”</p>
    <p>As the only Amer­i­can on the ex­pe­di­tion to Hen­der­son Is­land, Mr Howell had to do some­thing sim­i­lar. “You have to bring to­gether very dis­parate groups,” he said.</p>
    <p>Some mem­bers of the ex­pe­di­tion team fo­cused on re­search to un­der­stand where the plas­tic was com­ing from and how to re­cy­cle it. And oth­ers fo­cused on get­ting out the word on how a pris­tine is­land was over­whelmed by plas­tic.</p>
    <p>Some smaller en­vi­ron­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions also try to ed­u­cate peo­ple out­side en­vi­ron­men­tal cir­cles. Ms Camp­bell ac­knowl­edges that her group’s ef­forts have not nec­es­sar­ily improved ar­eas of the Ch­e­sa­peake Bay, but she shows that with­out ed­u­ca­tion ef­forts, it could have been much worse.</p>
    <p>Foun­da­tions can also push for change at large, pub­licly traded com­pa­nies by in­vest­ing as­sets and then fil­ing mo­tions as a share­holder in a com­pany.</p>
    <p>“Small foun­da­tions are of­ten the named share­hold­ers in share­holder ad­vo­cacy pro­pos­als,” said Ms Sada Geuss, an in­vest­ment man­ager at Tril­lium As­set Man­age­ment. Its foun­da­tion clients were named on mo­tions a few years ago to push Home De­pot to sell more sus­tain­able lum­ber and to stop us­ing on plants it sold a chem­i­cal that has been linked to the de­cline of bee colonies, she said.</p>
    <p>Share­holder ac­tions, when suc­cess­ful, can have a sig­nif­i­cant im­pact; con­sider how much lum­ber and how many plants Home De­pot sells. The money used in such cam­paigns might other­wise have sat in an en­dow­ment.</p>
    <p>Even foun­da­tions that do not want to be­come part of a share­holder mo­tion can take steps to en­sure that their in­vest­ments align with their val­ues. Those steps can be as di­rect as in­vest­ing in clean en­ergy com­pa­nies or more in­di­rect, like in­vest­ing in com­pa­nies that make prod­ucts that will help other com­pa­nies be­come more ef­fi­cient.</p>
