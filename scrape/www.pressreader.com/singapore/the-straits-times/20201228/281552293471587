    <p>On pa­per, Bei­jing looks to be in a good po­si­tion to ex­pand its soft power and in­flu­ence. But there are con­cerns over the dearth of vac­cine data and its per­ceived use for geopo­lit­i­cal goals. China cor­re­spon­dent Dan­son Cheong looks at why China’s soft power push is not as sim­ple as a shot in the arm.</p>
    <p>Early on in the coro­n­avirus out­break as coun­tries were grap­pling with the rapid spread of Covid-19, China sent boxes upon boxes of masks and other pro­tec­tive equip­ment abroad.</p>
    <p>Th­ese items ar­rived in var­i­ous coun­tries bear­ing stick­ers of the Chi­nese flag, in a dis­play of what has been called “mask di­plo­macy”.</p>
    <p>With the world in the grip of a rag­ing pan­demic, it was a golden op­por­tu­nity for China to re­shape the nar­ra­tive of how it had mis­han­dled the ini­tial stages of the out­break, and to po­si­tion it­self as a global leader at a time of great need.</p>
    <p>But as it has since turned out, the pub­lic re­la­tions cam­paign was a flop. Re­ports of un­scrupu­lous pri­vate Chi­nese firms sell­ing sub-stan­dard masks, test kits and ven­ti­la­tors tar­nished ef­forts to win good­will. Overzeal­ous Chi­nese diplo­mats who asked re­cip­i­ent coun­tries for praise and grat­i­tude also raised ques­tions about Bei­jing’s al­tru­ism.</p>
    <p>But now, as test­ing for China’s Covid-19 vac­cines nears com­ple­tion, Bei­jing has been given a se­cond chance to re­pair its in­ter­na­tional im­age and po­si­tion it­self as part of the global so­lu­tion to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>On pa­per, Bei­jing looks to be in a good po­si­tion to ex­pand its soft power and in­flu­ence. With in­fec­tions within its bor­ders un­der con­trol, China has greater lat­i­tude to dis­trib­ute its vac­cines over­seas – un­like the United States, which has pri­ori­tised in­oc­u­lat­ing Amer­i­cans first.</p>
    <p>In May, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping said Chi­nese vac­cines would be a “global pub­lic good”, and China sub­se­quently joined the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO)-backed Co­vax ini­tia­tive – from which the US is con­spic­u­ously ab­sent – to help en­sure eq­ui­table global dis­tri­bu­tion of Covid-19 vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Steve Tsang from the SOAS China In­sti­tute in Lon­don said there was “no doubt that Bei­jing is try­ing to use the sup­ply of vac­cines to boost its soft power”.</p>
    <p>“But a lot will de­pend on how it goes about it,” he said, point­ing out it was un­likely that Chi­nese-made vac­cines would be pro­vided for free af­ter they have com­pleted clin­i­cal tests.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has no doubt learnt from its ear­lier mis­takes, but this lat­est “vac­cine di­plo­macy” push is not as straight­for­ward as it seems.</p>
    <p>SOFT POWER PUSH</p>
    <p>Of the 18 vac­cines cur­rently in phase three clin­i­cal tri­als, five are from China. Th­ese are be­ing de­vel­oped by four vac­cine mak­ers which are con­duct­ing tri­als in some 16 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese vac­cine mak­ers have had to go abroad to con­duct fi­nal-stage test­ing, since they re­quire vac­cines to be field-tested in an en­vi­ron­ment where the virus is still spread­ing. In re­turn, th­ese coun­tries have been given pref­er­en­tial ac­cess to Chi­nese vac­cines.</p>
    <p>State me­dia re­ported this month that some 500 mil­lion doses of Chi­nese vac­cines have been or­dered by for­eign coun­tries so far, largely by host coun­tries where th­ese drugs are be­ing tested.</p>
    <p>De­vel­oped coun­tries have snapped up Western-made vac­cines, leav­ing a gap in the de­vel­op­ing world that ex­perts say China is mov­ing in to fill.</p>
    <p>Rich na­tions have bought al­most all of next year’s sup­ply of the two vac­cine front run­ners – one by Pfizer-BioNTech and the other by Moderna – ac­cord­ing to the Peo­ple’s Vac­cine Al­liance (PVA), a net­work of or­gan­i­sa­tions that in­cludes Amnesty In­ter­na­tional, Ox­fam and Global Jus­tice Now.</p>
    <p>Canada, for in­stance, has or­dered enough vac­cines to in­oc­u­late each Cana­dian five times, although it has pledged to share any ex­cess with other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion is such that nine in 10 peo­ple in 67 de­vel­op­ing coun­tries – in­clud­ing na­tions like Cam­bo­dia, Laos and Pak­istan – stand lit­tle chance of be­ing vac­ci­nated next year, said the PVA this month.</p>
    <p>To th­ese coun­tries, China’s vac­cines are a life­saver.</p>
    <p>This month, the United Arab Emi­rates (UAE) and Bahrain be­came the first two coun­tries to grant full ap­proval to a vac­cine made by state-owned firm Sinopharm, even be­fore full clin­i­cal trial re­sults have been pub­lished.</p>
    <p>While Bei­jing has re­jected claims that it is us­ing its vac­cines as a tool for global in­flu­ence, say­ing it is com­mit­ted to shar­ing its vac­cines with the world, it is not hard to see how its pos­tur­ing over its vac­cines aligns with its for­eign pol­icy goals.</p>
    <p>Dr Huang Yanzhong, a se­nior fel­low for global health at the Coun­cil on For­eign Re­la­tions in New York City, said Bei­jing’s ac­tions present this im­age of a “be­nign great power pro­vid­ing ac­cess to coun­tries ex­cluded from the global dis­tri­bu­tion of th­ese vac­cines”.</p>
    <p>But they also ex­pand the mar­ket share for Chi­nese vac­cines in the de­vel­op­ing world, since Western al­ter­na­tives have largely cor­nered the de­vel­oped mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“When you look at those coun­tries they want to pri­ori­tise vac­cine ac­cess for, all of them are in the de­vel­op­ing world, al­most all of them are cov­ered by the (Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive), and some of those coun­tries are con­sid­ered strate­gi­cally im­por­tant to Bei­jing, like Pak­istan and In­done­sia,” said Dr Huang.</p>
    <p>Top Chi­nese lead­ers have promised pri­or­ity ac­cess to coun­tries in­clud­ing Cam­bo­dia, Myan­mar, Laos, Thai­land, Viet­nam, Malaysia and African na­tions.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia re­ceived 1.2 mil­lion doses of Si­no­vac’s vac­cines this month. An­other 1.8 mil­lion doses are ex­pected to ar­rive next month.</p>
    <p>LACK OF TRANS­PARENCY</p>
    <p>The dearth of data around China’s vac­cine can­di­dates is un­set­tling.</p>
    <p>Both Pfizer and Moderna have an­nounced that their vac­cines ap­pear to be about 95 per cent ef­fec­tive, while the vac­cine pro­duced by Ox­ford Univer­sity and As­traZeneca has an ef­fi­cacy of up to 90 per cent. But none of the Chi­nese vac­cine can­di­dates have re­leased of­fi­cial pre­lim­i­nary data from phase three tri­als.</p>
    <p>The UAE, which ap­proved the Sinopharm vac­cine, said tri­als in the coun­try showed the drug to be 86 per cent ef­fec­tive. Mean­while, Brazil said a clin­i­cal trial on Si­no­vac Biotech’s vac­cine in the coun­try yielded over 50 per cent ef­fec­tive­ness – the min­i­mum stan­dard set by US reg­u­la­tors for emer­gency au­tho­ri­sa­tion of Covid-19 vac­cines.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese health au­thor­i­ties have pointed to the fact that over a mil­lion Chi­nese peo­ple have been in­oc­u­lated with the ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cines un­der emer­gency-use pro­to­cols with­out any ad­verse re­ac­tions, as proof of its safety.</p>
    <p>With­out trans­par­ent data on the vac­cines, how­ever, Bei­jing will find it hard to in­spire con­fi­dence in what it has to of­fer.</p>
    <p>Last week, Hong Kong said its res­i­dents will be al­lowed to choose which shot they want to take among sev­eral vac­cine can­di­dates that will likely in­clude Si­no­vac’s.</p>
    <p>It also does not help that past vac­cine scan­dals in China have sapped global con­fi­dence, in­clud­ing one as re­cent as 2018 where a lead­ing vac­cine man­u­fac­turer was found to have made ra­bies vac­cines with ex­pired prod­ucts. “Chi­nese-made vac­cines don’t have a good es­tab­lished rep­u­ta­tion in the de­vel­oped world, and given its do­mes­tic record, this is an im­por­tant fac­tor as to why coun­tries are still scep­ti­cal about</p>
    <p>China’s vac­cines,” said Dr Huang.</p>
    <p>Put sim­ply, for China’s soft power push to work, its vac­cines must be shown to be ef­fec­tive and stand up to sci­en­tific scru­tiny.</p>
    <p>Un­like masks and test kits, vac­cines are in­jected into the hu­man body and can­not be jet­ti­soned if found to be faulty.</p>
    <p>NO FREE LUNCH</p>
    <p>At the same time, there are wor­ries that China’s vac­cine push could hand it too much lever­age in the re­gion, said Mr Lye Liang Fook, se­nior fel­low at the ISEAS – Yu­sof Ishak In­sti­tute in Sin­ga­pore. Be­ing de­pen­dent on Chi­nese vac­cines could cause coun­tries to tone down their crit­i­cism of China when it comes to ter­ri­to­rial dis­putes.</p>
    <p>Mr Lye pointed out that Asean na­tions such as Malaysia, the Philip­pines and In­done­sia have been con­scious about not re­ly­ing solely on China-made vac­cines. Th­ese coun­tries are also sign­ing deals with other firms such as Pfizer, As­traZeneca and Rus­sia’s Ga­ma­leya In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>Malaysia and the Philip­pines have com­pet­ing claims with China in the South China Sea, while In­done­sia and China are in a dis­pute over fish­ing rights around In­done­sia’s Natuna Is­lands.</p>
    <p>No­tably, Cam­bo­dian Prime Min­is­ter Hun Sen re­cently said the coun­try would ac­cept vac­cines ap­proved only by the WHO, and that his coun­try was not a “dust­bin” for Chi­nese trial vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Mr Lye said: “It tells you that even coun­tries that are more amenable to China are, at least pub­licly, show­ing that they are be­ing po­lit­i­cally con­scious.”</p>
    <p>The worry is that Bei­jing could use the sup­ply of vac­cines as lever­age to achieve its geopo­lit­i­cal goals in the re­gion, or cut off the sup­ply should there be dis­agree­ments.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal ten­sions be­tween China and Canada are be­lieved to be the rea­son the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties blocked Tian­jin-based com­pany CanSino Bi­o­log­ics from ship­ping its test vac­cines to Canada for tri­als a few months ago.</p>
    <p>IM­MU­NITY GAP</p>
    <p>Some ex­perts like Dr Huang feel that the mass vac­ci­na­tion pro­grammes launched in</p>
    <p>Western coun­tries such as the US and Bri­tain this month have placed added pres­sure on Bei­jing to pri­ori­tise its do­mes­tic pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>There is also the like­li­hood of an “im­mu­nity gap” de­vel­op­ing, where Western na­tions achieve herd im­mu­nity from the virus be­fore China, mean­ing th­ese coun­tries would be able to re­turn to nor­malcy, while Bei­jing would have to keep up its strict con­trol mea­sures at con­sid­er­able eco­nomic cost.</p>
    <p>“It is not only epi­demi­o­log­i­cally bad for China, but also po­lit­i­cally danger­ous, be­cause China would no longer be able to point to the in­ef­fec­tive­ness of</p>
    <p>Western coun­tries in han­dling the out­break to show the su­pe­ri­or­ity of its po­lit­i­cal sys­tem,” said Dr Huang.</p>
    <p>The health au­thor­i­ties have said that China would be able to pro­duce about 610 mil­lion vac­cine doses this year and an­other one bil­lion next year, but about 500 mil­lion vac­cine doses have been ear­marked to be shipped abroad.</p>
    <p>Sup­pos­ing two doses are needed for each vac­ci­na­tion, and that vac­cine pro­duc­tion ca­pac­i­ties do not in­crease, that amount would not be enough for the 70 per cent of China’s 1.4 bil­lion peo­ple that Bei­jing needs to in­oc­u­late to reach herd im­mu­nity next year.</p>
    <p>There are signs that Bei­jing recog­nises the risk of this hap­pen­ing, said Dr Huang, point­ing to re­cent re­ports that China in­tends to vac­ci­nate some 50 mil­lion peo­ple by Chi­nese New Year next year.</p>
    <p>But if it wants to achieve herd im­mu­nity ahead of Western coun­tries, it could mean reneg­ing on prom­ises made to the de­vel­op­ing world.</p>
    <p>“If you fail to de­liver the amount of vac­cines you prom­ise, that is going to tar­nish Bei­jing’s im­age. This is a dilemma that I think Chi­nese lead­ers will have to grap­ple with in the near fu­ture,” said Dr Huang.</p>
    <p>The in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion could also frus­trate China’s out­reach if the ad­min­is­tra­tion takes a more ac­tive stance in vac­cine di­plo­macy, and sets aside a por­tion of its vac­cines for de­vel­op­ing coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Add a rapidly mu­tat­ing virus into the mix of all th­ese con­cerns and the only cer­tainty is that Bei­jing’s vac­cine di­plo­macy is not going to be as sim­ple as a shot in the arm.</p>
