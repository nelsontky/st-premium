    <p>scheme, then DPM Goh said there will always be qual­i­fied Sin­ga­pore­ans who are un­able or un­will­ing to take part in elec­tions and look af­ter a con­stituency, and the scheme al­lows them to con­trib­ute their ex­per­tise and in­sights.</p>
    <p>They can also be re­lied on to be non-par­ti­san, un­like op­po­si­tion MPs, he said. “They do not have to play to the gallery. They can be con­struc­tive while dis­sent­ing, thus con­tribut­ing to good gov­ern­ment.”</p>
    <p>The Constituti­on ini­tially pro­vided for up to six NMPs, which was bumped up to nine in 1997 fol­low­ing a con­sti­tu­tional amend­ment. The orig­i­nal re­quire­ment – that Par­lia­ment must pass a res­o­lu­tion be­fore NMPs can be ap­pointed – was abol­ished in April 2010.</p>
    <p>For­mer NMP Anthea Ong said NMPs rep­re­sent sec­tors of so­ci­ety that may not oth­er­wise be on the radar of elected MPs, like the arts; or those that are not nec­es­sar­ily sup­ported by the ma­jor­ity, such as sex work­ers, mi­grant work­ers and LGBTQ (les­bian, gay, bi­sex­ual, trans­gen­der and queer) in­di­vid­u­als. “NMPs can bring these is­sues up with­out fear of los­ing votes.”</p>
    <p>SMU’s Prof Tan said the is­sue is not who voices the al­ter­na­tive views – the PAP, the op­po­si­tion or NMPs – but whether these views are con­sid­ered on their own mer­its, or ig­nored and re­but­ted for po­lit­i­cal con­sid­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>On this count, he found NMPs’ views on con­tro­ver­sial mat­ters – like the 2013 Pop­u­la­tion White Pa­per – to be “taken more se­ri­ously” by the front bench.</p>
    <p>This may have to do with their non-par­ti­san stance, es­pe­cially in such a po­larised de­bate, he said.</p>
    <p>“Some min­is­ters i n the past tended to re­gard the op­po­si­tion’s pointed ques­tions and speeches as scor­ing de­bat­ing points and treated them ac­cord­ingly, giv­ing them the short shrift.”</p>
    <p>A ma­jor con­tri­bu­tion from an NMP is the Main­te­nance of Par­ents Act, which was in­tro­duced as a pri­vate mem­ber’s Bill by then NMP Walter Woon in 1994 and passed in Par­lia­ment in 1995.</p>
    <p>Ms Kan­waljit Soin, the first wo­man NMP, also put up a Fam­ily Vi­o­lence Bill in 1995. Although the Bill was not sup­ported, her pro­pos­als were in­cluded in amend­ments to the Women’s Char­ter.</p>
    <p>LEADER OF THE OP­PO­SI­TION</p>
    <p>In the lat­est move that des­ig­nates WP chief Pri­tam Singh as Leader of the Op­po­si­tion (LO), he will have the right of first re­sponse among MPs, have more time to speak in Par­lia­ment and get con­fi­den­tial brief­ings from the Gov­ern­ment. He will also get al­lowances to hire more staff.</p>
    <p>Along with these priv­i­leges come du­ties, such as lead­ing and or­gan­is­ing the scru­tiny of the Gov­ern­ment’s po­si­tions and ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh will also be con­sulted on the ap­point­ment of op­po­si­tion mem­bers to par­lia­men­tary Select Com­mit­tees, and may be called on to at­tend of­fi­cial state func­tions and take part in gov­ern­ment vis­its and meet­ings.</p>
    <p>The po­si­tion is not pro­vided for in the Constituti­on or the Stand­ing Or­ders of Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has never had for­mal LOs even in the 1950s and early 1960s, when there were size­able num­bers of op­po­si­tion leg­isla­tive as­sem­bly­men.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee Kuan Yew, who led the PAP as the largest op­po­si­tion party be­tween 1955 and 1959 – it held four out of 25 elected seats in the Leg­isla­tive As­sem­bly – and Dr Lee</p>
    <p>Siew Choh, who led Barisan Sosialis be­tween 1961 and 1963, were never for­mally des­ig­nated as LO.</p>
    <p>In de­cid­ing on the specifics of the of­fice, the Gov­ern­ment had looked to other West­min­ster par­lia­men­tary sys­tems such as Aus­tralia and Bri­tain, which have for­mally des­ig­nated op­po­si­tion, and also con­sid­ered Sin­ga­pore’s cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>LO en­ti­tle­ments vary from coun­try to coun­try. Some, like Mr Keir Starmer of Bri­tain’s Labour Party, re­ceive al­most the same salary as a Cab­i­net min­is­ter, and more than half that of the Bri­tish prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Chong Ja Ian said the for­mal­i­sa­tion of the LO role recog­nises an in­creas­ingly ma­ture Sin­ga­pore polity, and peo­ple’s de­sire for an op­po­si­tion that can play not just an over­sight role, but also rep­re­sent per­spec­tives held by a mi­nor­ity.</p>
    <p>For­mer PAP MP Mr Singh said that de­spite the ex­tra re­sources given to the LO, op­po­si­tion MPs must still come up with qual­ity ideas them­selves, as the sum of money given will not be enough to “hire peo­ple who could help come up with ideas that can match that pro­duced by the civil ser­vice that is well staffed and well re­sourced”.</p>
    <p>He said raised ex­pec­ta­tions could work against the op­po­si­tion if it fails to de­liver ideas and al­ter­na­tives of the ex­pected qual­ity.</p>
    <p>One thing is clear, said Mr Ram: The Sin­ga­pore elec­torate is now more ed­u­cated and opin­ion­ated,</p>
    <p>IM­POR­TANCE OF NCMPs</p>
    <p>You can put a sail on the sam­pan, catch the wind and go fast with­out fear of it cap­siz­ing. The NCMP scheme is an im­por­tant out­rig­ger for our po­lit­i­cal sys­tem.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>FOR­MER PRIME MIN­IS­TER GOH CHOK TONG</p>
    <p>and politi­cians will have to adapt to the times.</p>
    <p>He added that as young Sin­ga­pore­ans con­sume more of their in­for­ma­tion on­line, it may be time to re­con­sider broad­cast­ing Par­lia­ment pro­ceed­ings live.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment had said ear­lier this year that de­mand for such broad­casts is low, and they create a risk that Par­lia­ment is turned into a form of theatre in­stead of a fo­rum for se­ri­ous de­bate on na­tional is­sues.</p>
    <p>With the in­crease in the num­ber of MPs – 93, up from 89 in 2015 – and the spike in op­po­si­tion rep­re­sen­ta­tion, he said Par­lia­ment may need to raise the num­ber of days of sit­tings, and hire more staff to cope with the ad­di­tional prepa­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>SMU’s Prof Tan said the var­i­ous con­sti­tu­tional changes re­flect an in­sti­tu­tional de­sign that al­lows the Gov­ern­ment of the day to rule de­ci­sively in the long-term in­ter­ests of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>At the same time, he added, the po­lit­i­cal lead­er­ship is acutely aware of the grow­ing de­sire for a more com­pet­i­tive and vi­brant po­lit­i­cal sys­tem, and has been mak­ing fur­ther changes to ad­dress this.</p>
    <p>“There must be in­clu­sive­ness and rep­re­sen­ta­tion in tan­dem with Sin­ga­pore­ans’ grow­ing demo­cratic as­pi­ra­tions, in­creas­ing civic par­tic­i­pa­tion and demo­cratic own­er­ship of gov­ern­men­tal pro­cesses,” he said.</p>
