    <p>Res­i­dents at a dor­mi­tory will un­dergo more fre­quent rou­tine test­ing for Covid-19 to see if it helps in de­tect­ing new in­fec­tions ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, all mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries need to un­dergo ros­tered rou­tine test­ing ev­ery 14 days. This is part of a mul­ti­lay­ered strat­egy for ef­fec­tive preven­tion of new in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The Man­power and Health min­istries said yes­ter­day that over a pe­riod of four weeks from to­mor­row, the Government will trial an ad­di­tional round of test­ing for res­i­dents in Toh Guan Dor­mi­tory.</p>
    <p>“This will ef­fec­tively in­crease the test­ing fre­quency to a seven-day cy­cle. New in­fec­tions can then be de­tected ear­lier, and the spread con­tained more quickly,” said the min­istries in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>To min­imise the im­pact on the work­ers’ sched­ule, the pi­lot will be con­ducted within the dor­mi­tory.</p>
    <p>In­stead of the usual na­sopha­ryn­geal swab, a new orophar­ynx/mid­turbinate nasal method of swab­bing will be used.</p>
    <p>Asked about this at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, the Min­istry of Health’s di­rec­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices Ken­neth Mak ex­plained that with na­sopha­ryn­geal swabs, a swab is in­serted all the way up the nos­trils to the back of a per­son’s nose.</p>
    <p>“While this has seen very ef­fec­tive col­lec­tion of sam­ples for test­ing, giv­ing us very good re­sults, we are very mind­ful that this is not a pleas­ant ex­pe­ri­ence. And for in­di­vid­u­als who have to do this on a very reg­u­lar ba­sis... ev­ery 14 days, this can be, over time, a very trau­matic ex­pe­ri­ence,” he said.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Mak added that this may, in turn, re­sult in work­ers not want­ing to com­ply with be­ing reg­u­larly tested.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, the new method in­volves a swab taken from the back of the throat, and an­other swab taken from par­tially up the nose, both of which are re­port­edly less un­com­fort­able.</p>
    <p>Prof Mak said the au­thor­i­ties will also be study­ing whether it might be pos­si­ble to do just one of the swabs. They are also look­ing into ex­plor­ing other meth­ods of sam­ple col­lec­tion, in­clud­ing tak­ing deep throat saliva spec­i­mens.</p>
    <p>“But our stud­ies are still i n progress and we are not cur­rently in the po­si­tion to shift to­wards us­ing saliva test­ing at this point in time. So that’s one part in terms of our way of try­ing to make test­ing a much more pleas­ant ex­pe­ri­ence for those who are sub­ject to test­ing reg­i­mens,” he said.</p>
    <p>In their state­ment, the min­istries also said that with ear­lier de­tec­tion of new in­fec­tions, the Min­istry of</p>
    <p>Man­power may not re­quire an en­tire block of a dor­mi­tory to be quar­an­tined should there be a Covid-19 case, as long as safe liv­ing mea­sures are com­plied with.</p>
    <p>Elab­o­rat­ing, Prof Mak said that given the “high-risk” set­ting of com­mu­nal liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries, it is dif­fi­cult to com­pletely pre­vent in­ter­min­gling.</p>
    <p>“The en­vi­ron­ment is rich for a high-risk spread to take place very rapidly if any one in­di­vid­ual within that com­mu­nity gets sick,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that the au­thor­i­ties are try­ing to see if more fre­quent test­ing, such as the kind be­ing tri­alled at Toh Guan Dor­mi­tory, will give them the chance to in­ter­vene ear­lier if some­one is in­fected and thus pre­vent clus­ters from form­ing.</p>
    <p>“(This al­lows) for an op­por­tu­nity for work­ers to con­tinue to work in a safer en­vi­ron­ment and also to pre­vent the dis­rup­tions that would take place when large num­bers of work­ers have to be quar­an­tined as a re­sult of pick­ing up pos­i­tive cases dur­ing these test­ing regimes,” he said.</p>
