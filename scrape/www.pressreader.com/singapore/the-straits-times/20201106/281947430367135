    <p>Rais­ing a child with spe­cial needs is chal­leng­ing. Amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, this chal­lenge is com­pounded – chil­dren with autism find a sense of sta­bil­ity in rou­tine and changes of­ten leave them strug­gling to adapt.</p>
    <p>When chil­dren with autism who are used to fol­low­ing school regimes are asked to study at home, few may be able to adapt to the new rou­tines. Frus­tra­tion and anger can arise.</p>
    <p>And post-Covid-19, there may be more chal­lenges to their fu­ture.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has been em­pha­sis­ing the need for up­skilling and job re­train­ing. But for a seg­ment of our com­mu­nity that in­her­ently finds it more dif­fi­cult to adapt to change, it may be harder for them to ac­cept the new nor­mal.</p>
    <p>When I was in­tern­ing at a spe­cial ed­u­ca­tion school, the teach­ers there told me that em­ploy­ment re­mains a sig­nif­i­cant chal­lenge for those with autism when they grad­u­ate.</p>
    <p>Their ed­u­ca­tion mostly re­mains cen­tred on tech­ni­cal skills that they can mas­ter over time – train­ing for jobs that are rou­tinised. This is one group that may be left be­hind as changes to the econ­omy lead to the need for skills up­grad­ing.</p>
    <p>Sup­port from par­ents, teach­ers and the Gov­ern­ment is im­per­a­tive for chil­dren with spe­cial needs. Dif­fer­ent stake­hold­ers must pool re­sources to pro­vide suf­fi­cient at­ten­tion and sup­port to help peo­ple with spe­cial needs flour­ish.</p>
    <p>By be­ing more open to them and un­der­stand­ing their strug­gles, em­ploy­ers can be more ac­cept­ing of those with spe­cial needs and con­sider giv­ing them a chance, even as the world changes.</p>
    <p>With the Gov­ern­ment sup­port­ing the growth of new en­ter­prises post-Covid-19 and with schemes in place to sup­port un­der­grad­u­ates and ma­ture work­ers, per­haps em­ploy­ers could also re­mem­ber the spe­cial needs com­mu­nity and work to­wards en­sur­ing mean­ing­ful em­ploy­ment for them.</p>
