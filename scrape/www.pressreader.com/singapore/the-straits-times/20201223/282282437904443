    <p>Lo­gis­tics firm Ninja Van has seen its busi­ness grow this year as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic brought on a surge in e-com­merce, and con­sumers turned to on­line shop­ping amid lock­downs and move­ment restrictio­ns glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive Lai Chang Wen told The Straits Times the pan­demic has led to sig­nif­i­cant in­creases in par­cel vol­umes across its net­work in South­east Asia, with more brick-and­mor­tar stores piv­ot­ing to­wards ere­tail and ex­ist­ing e-com­merce sell­ers selling more when many peo­ple were con­fined to their homes dur­ing lock­down.</p>
    <p>Mr Lai, 33, started Ninja Van in 2014 with two friends, af­ter ex­pe­ri­enc­ing first-hand the pain of the lo­gis­tics side of e-com­merce when they launched an on­line men’s fash­ion line, which was wound up around a year af­ter.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has come a long way since its early days, when its co-founders were de­liv­er­ing or­ders out of a sec­ond-hand van. It now de­liv­ers more than a mil­lion pack­ages daily across six coun­tries in the re­gion, such as Indonesia and the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>In May, Ninja Van raised US$279 mil­lion (S$372 mil­lion) in its Se­ries D fund­ing round – one of South-east Asia’s largest start-up in­vest­ments scored since the start of the Covid-19 pan­demic. Among its back­ers in the round were Facebook co-founder Ed­uardo Saverin’s B Cap­i­tal Group, ven­ture cap­i­tal firm Monk’s Hill Ven­tures, ride-hail­ing com­pany Grab and two sov­er­eign wealth funds.</p>
    <p>Last month, Ninja Van teamed up with Myan­mar dig­i­tal ser­vices plat­form NearMe to al­low its busi­ness part­ners in Myan­mar to use the e-pay­ments plat­form.</p>
    <p>With new safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures put in place, the start-up has adapted to new re­quire­ments, and rolled out its con­tact­less de­liv­ery ser­vices in April. It has also de­cen­tralised its main lo­gis­tics hubs, pro­vid­ing more lo­calised cov­er­age in its re­gional net­work.</p>
    <p>Mr Lai said the past 12 months have tested the firm’s re­silience and adapt­abil­ity. “This up­lift in our busi­ness has been tem­pered by busi­ness dis­rup­tions caused by gov­ern­ment lock­downs across South-east Asia, height­ened health and safety re­quire­ments in work­places, and chal­lenges in cross-bor­der trans­porta­tion.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany is look­ing to in­crease ef­forts in the lo­gis­tics space as de­mand for e-com­merce con­tin­ues to grow in the com­ing year, such as in cross-bor­der es­crow pro­cure­ment ser­vices and sales chan­nel im­prove­ments.</p>
    <p>While it has seen com­mer­cial growth, it has also con­trib­uted to the Sin­ga­pore com­mu­nity amid the pan­demic. Ninja Van col­lab­o­rated with me­dia production com­pany Night Owl Cine­mat­ics to dis­trib­ute care packs to vul­ner­a­ble house­holds, rais­ing close to $1 mil­lion and de­liv­er­ing about 39,000 care packs ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>In May, Ninja Van raised US$279 mil­lion (S$372 mil­lion) in its Se­ries D fund­ing round – one of South-east Asia’s largest start-up in­vest­ments scored since the start of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
