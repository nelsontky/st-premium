    <p>NEW YORK The Sin­ga­pore dol­lar, euro, and Aussie and New Zealand dol­lars all posted more than twoyear highs against the strug­gling green­back.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore dol­lar was trad­ing at US$1.3230 yes­ter­day morn­ing, up 1.7 per cent for the year. This is also the high­est for the Sing­dol­lar since April 2018.</p>
    <p>In­vestors are bet­ting that an im­prov­ing eco­nomic out­look as Covid-19 vac­cines are rolled out and un­prece­dented fis­cal and mon­e­tary stim­u­lus will boost global growth and as­set prices this year.</p>
    <p>US eco­nomic growth is ex­pected to drag be­hind peers, how­ever, with the US cur­rency also suf­fer­ing from ris­ing fis­cal and cur­rent ac­count deficits as the gov­ern­ment in­creases spend­ing to tackle coro­n­avirus-re­lated busi­ness shut­downs.</p>
    <p>Data on Wed­nes­day showed that the ad­vance US goods trade deficit rose to a record US$84.8 bil­lion (S$112 bil­lion) in Novem­ber, from US$80.3 bil­lion in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>“The start of Covid-19 im­mu­ni­sa­tion cam­paigns in sev­eral coun­tries as well as ad­di­tional US fis­cal sup­port have re­duced down­side risk to the global econ­omy and bode well for gen­eral fi­nan­cial mar­ket sen­ti­ment. This re­mains a drag for USD,” Mr Elias Had­dad, se­nior cur­rency strate­gist at Com­mon­wealth Bank of Aus­tralia, said in a re­port on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The US dol­lar fell 0.4 per cent against a bas­ket of cur­ren­cies to 89.65 on Wed­nes­day af­ter ear­lier drop­ping to 89.56, the low­est since April 2018. It was down more than 7 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>Trad­ing vol­umes are thin, with many in­vestors out be­tween the</p>
    <p>Christ­mas and New Year hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>The euro reached US$1.2310, be­fore fall­ing back to US$1.2292, up 0.3 per cent on the day.</p>
    <p>The Aussie surged to US$0.7686, and was last up 0.9 per cent at US$0.7676. The kiwi reached US$0.7213, and was last at US$0.7200, up 0.7 per cent.</p>
    <p>It was the high­est level for all three cur­ren­cies against the US dol­lar since April 2018.</p>
    <p>The US dol­lar also slipped 0.2 per cent to 103.23 yen. It is hold­ing just above a nine-month low of 102.86 yen reached on Dec 17.</p>
    <p>Op­ti­mism of fur­ther US stim­u­lus came even af­ter Se­nate Ma­jor­ity Leader Mitch McCon­nell on Tues­day put off a vote on in­creas­ing Covid-19 re­lief cheques from US$600 to US$2,000.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den is ex­pected to push for more mea­sures to sup­port the US econ­omy af­ter he is in­au­gu­rated this month.</p>
    <p>Other data on Wed­nes­day showed that con­tracts to buy US pre­vi­ously owned homes fell for a third straight month in Novem­ber as an acute short­age of prop­er­ties pushed up prices.</p>
    <p>The ster­ling also jumped as law­mak­ers ap­proved Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris Johnson’s postBrexit trade deal with the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>The pound gained 0.9 per cent to US$1.3618. It is hold­ing just be­low the US$1.3625 level reached last month, the high­est since May 2018.</p>
    <p>The green­back fell 0.4 per cent against the loonie to C$1.2765.</p>
