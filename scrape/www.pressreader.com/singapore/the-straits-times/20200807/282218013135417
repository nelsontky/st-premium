    <p>NEW YORK • The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) has said it is “un­re­al­is­tic” to ex­pect large crowds at ma­jor sports events this year in coun­tries suf­fer­ing from com­mu­nity-level trans­mis­sion of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>WHO health emer­gen­cies ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor Michael Ryan feels it could be “disas­trous” in such cir­cum­stances to al­low the re­turn of sports matches with tens of thou­sands of peo­ple at­tend­ing.</p>
    <p>Asked in a live WHO so­cial me­dia chat when ma­jor sports events could come back in front of packed venues, he said on Wed­nes­day that it was im­pos­si­ble to pre­dict.</p>
    <p>“We don’t know,” the Ir­ish epi­demi­ol­o­gist said.</p>
    <p>“Large crowds of 40, 50, 60,000 peo­ple – it’s not just the risk of be­ing in the sta­dium, it’s the risk of go­ing to the sta­dium, the pub­lic trans­port, the bars and the clubs,” he ex­plained.</p>
    <p>“Imag­ine all the prob­lems we have now with night­clubs and bars, and you squeeze all of that to­gether into a four- or five-hour ex­pe­ri­ence, where thou­sands of peo­ple go on the same pub­lic trans­port to a venue, get in­volved in the so­cial as­pects be­fore a game, be in­volved in the game and then all of the so­cial as­pects af­ter.</p>
    <p>“In the con­text of com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion, that could be disas­trous.”</p>
    <p>The Tokyo 2020 Olympics and the Euro 2020 foot­ball cham­pi­onship have been post­poned un­til next year, while ma­jor com­pe­ti­tions like the Cham­pi­ons League and the English Premier League have been forced be­hind closed doors.</p>
    <p>“We may have to ex­pect that as things open up, we go from hav­ing no one at the games to maybe 1,000 and 2,000,” said Ryan.</p>
    <p>“We all want our sport back. We’re just go­ing to have to be care­ful for a good bit longer.</p>
    <p>“It’s very un­re­al­is­tic in coun­tries with com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion that we’re go­ing to be see­ing large gath­er­ings like that this year.</p>
    <p>“Right now, it’s hard to see those fully re-opened venues.”</p>
