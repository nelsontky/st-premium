    <p>With mass par­tic­i­pa­tion sports events like The Straits Times Run go­ing vir­tual and team sports un­able to re­sume fully be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pandemic, more peo­ple are pound­ing pave­ments and park con­nec­tors for ex­er­cise and fresh air.</p>
    <p>How­ever, run­ners should take pre­cau­tions to en­sure they carry out their ex­er­cise reg­i­mens safely.</p>
    <p>Here are some tips to guide you:</p>
    <p>WATCH YOUR HEALTH</p>
    <p>If you are feel­ing un­der t he weather, do not at­tempt to run that day. Af­ter all, many vir­tual events al­low you to com­plete the races over a cer­tain time frame. For ex­am­ple, you have 60 days to com­plete the ST Vir­tual Run’s 175km race, which ends only on Dec 17.</p>
    <p>If you feel un­well at any time dur­ing or af­ter your run, stop at once and seek help from passers-by or use your mo­bile phone to ring emer­gency hot­lines or your fam­ily.</p>
    <p>SAFE DIS­TANC­ING</p>
    <p>Un­der Phase 2 guide­lines from Sport Sin­ga­pore, all run­ners should keep a dis­tance of at least two me­tres from other peo­ple and avoid run­ning in the slip­stream of oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Avoid crowded ar­eas. Avid run­ner and 96.3 Hao FM DJ Ong Teck Ming, who goes on 20-22km runs every week, said: “It’s best to avoid the peak hours when a lot of peo­ple are jog­ging or tak­ing a stroll in parks or park con­nec­tors.</p>
    <p>“It’s bet­ter to pick a qui­eter place or run dur­ing off-peak hours.”</p>
    <p>Avoid di­rect con­tact with high­touch points such as traf­fic-light but­tons and handrails.</p>
    <p>You may run in a group but the cur­rent limit is five per­sons at a time.</p>
    <p>Take a mask with you on your runs. You are ex­pected to wear it be­fore and af­ter your run, or if you stop to use a toi­let or en­ter a shop to buy a drink.</p>
    <p>HY­DRA­TION</p>
    <p>Make sure you drink up. With pub­lic wa­ter cool­ers avail­able only for re­fills, carry a small wa­ter bot­tle or a light fold­able wa­ter bot­tle or bag on your runs, es­pe­cially if it is a long-dis­tance one.</p>
    <p>For those who find a bot­tle too heavy to carry while run­ning, Ac­tiveSG run­ning coach Steven Quek says to plan your runs so that there is a wa­ter point you can stop at.</p>
    <p>Or, if you are do­ing loops, find a safe place to stash your wa­ter bot­tle.</p>
    <p>“We should make sure we’re well-hy­drated all the time, not just be­fore and af­ter our runs,” said Quek, 52. “The heat is an is­sue here and the next two weeks are pro­jected to be hot dur­ing the day, so run­ners should take pre­cau­tions and stay hy­drated be­cause heat in­juries can be fatal.”</p>
    <p>BE SEEN AT NIGHT</p>
    <p>It is im­por­tant to re­main as vis­i­ble as pos­si­ble to all other road users, es­pe­cially at night. Wear bright colours or some­thing with re­flec­tive el­e­ments.</p>
    <p>But, if you do not have bright­coloured ex­er­cise cloth­ing like lawyer and avid run­ner Reine Jong, you can use a clip-on light on your front and back so mo­torists, cy­clists and other run­ners can see you eas­ily.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old clips the de­vice on her run­ning vest when she goes on her 45-90 minute runs on park con­nec­tors thrice a week.</p>
    <p>She said: “The light pul­sates and that makes me very vis­i­ble.”</p>
    <p>RUN­NING ALONE</p>
    <p>Avoid run­ning in un­fa­mil­iar or se­cluded ar­eas alone.</p>
    <p>If you are run­ning alone, stick to places that are well-lit and fa­mil­iar to you. But, if you are bored with your reg­u­lar routes and want to ex­plore new ones, ar­range to go with some­one else.</p>
    <p>Quek also rec­om­mends go­ing to recce the place be­fore­hand or do­ing research on­line.</p>
    <p>He said: “Now with the In­ter­net, you can search and read about other peo­ple’s ex­pe­ri­ence in the places you’re in­ter­ested in and read about what it’s like there.”</p>
    <p>If you are run­ning off road or on dif­fer­ent ter­rain like the na­ture trails in reser­voirs, be­ware of un­sta­ble, un­even or slip­pery sur­faces.</p>
    <p>Make sure you bring your mo­bile phone with you in case you fall and are in­jured, or lose your way.</p>
    <p>You should also share your lo­ca­tion/route with some­one you trust, such as a fam­ily mem­ber or close friend. It is also ad­vis­able to give them an es­ti­mate of the time you ex­pect to com­plete your run. Re­mem­ber to check in with them when you are done.</p>
    <p>If you feel un­safe at any point along your route, turn back or seek the fastest way to reach an area where there are other peo­ple.</p>
    <p>There are some mo­bile phone apps – such as Road id, bSafe and Glympse – to help keep run­ners safe, though you should check if they are avail­able for use in Sin­ga­pore. An­other op­tion is the Share My Live Lo­ca­tion func­tion on What­sApp and Telegram if you do not want to down­load an­other app.</p>
    <p>STAY ALERT</p>
    <p>Be alert to your sur­round­ings when ex­er­cis­ing, es­pe­cially if you are in an un­fa­mil­iar place.</p>
    <p>Jong noted: “I make sure I’m not too tired so I can be alert to my sur­round­ings and blind curves on the road where I’m not vis­i­ble to ap­proach­ing cars.”</p>
    <p>To that end, Quek em­pha­sised the im­por­tance of suf­fi­cient rest, ex­plain­ing: “We should make sure we’re well-rested, so that we’ll have enough en­ergy to com­plete our runs and we can con­cen­trate on run­ning safely.”</p>
    <p>If you lis­ten to mu­sic, make sure you can still hear the sounds of traf­fic, bi­cy­cles, scoot­ers or peo­ple around you. Do not turn up the vol­ume of your head­phones too much.</p>
    <p>Loh Guo Pei, coach of the New Bal­ance Run­ning Club who also helms an ad­vi­sory col­umn for The ST Vir­tual Run, also sug­gested: “If you’re lis­ten­ing to mu­sic, it is ad­vis­able to just plug into one side.”</p>
