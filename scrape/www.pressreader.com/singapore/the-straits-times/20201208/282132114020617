    <p>A for­mer as­sis­tant sales man­ager at Sin­ga­pore Straits Wine Com­pany was fined $3,000 yes­ter­day af­ter plead­ing guilty to a cor­rup­tion charge. Malaysian Ee Chay Wea, 39, ad­mit­ted to giv­ing a bribe of $822 to David Ang Wei Xiong, 34, in May 2018.</p>
    <p>Ang, a Chi­nese na­tional, was then a mar­ket­ing com­mu­ni­ca­tions man­ager work­ing for lux­ury watch re­tailer Sin­cere Watch.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments did not state if he is still with the com­pany.</p>
    <p>An­other cor­rup­tion charge was taken into con­sid­er­a­tion dur­ing Ee’s sen­tenc­ing by District Judge Chee Min Ping.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Ee had met Ang while pur­chas­ing a watch for her boyfriend in Septem­ber 2017.</p>
    <p>Af­ter ob­serv­ing that Sin­cere Watch served sparkling wine and cham­pagne to its cus­tomers, Ee felt that there could be op­por­tu­ni­ties to get sales from the com­pany.</p>
    <p>She then handed her name card to Ang and also sent a wine sam­ple to Sin­cere Watch.</p>
    <p>In March 2018, Ang asked Ee if her com­pany could give him in­cen­tives for pur­chas­ing wine from it.</p>
    <p>She re­ferred his re­quest to Jan­ice Yip Kin Chee, who was the com­pany’s head of op­er­a­tions at the time. Yip agreed.</p>
    <p>In April 2018, Ang sent Ee two or­ders of wine for Sin­cere Watch.</p>
    <p>He also handed over a din­ing re­ceipt of $822 to her, which she passed to Yip. Ee later gave Ang the same amount in May 2018.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Thi­agesh Suku­maran said Ee was re­im­bursed for the bribe through pay­ments of her salary for May and June that year.</p>
    <p>Yip had in­structed the wine com­pany’s ac­count­ing de­part­ment to re­pay Ee un­der the guise of a per­for­mance in­cen­tive, he added.</p>
    <p>Ang has been charged with two counts of cor­rup­tion. His case is ex­pected to be heard on Dec 22.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Ee’s lawyer Val­li­ap­pan Subra­ma­niam said in mit­i­ga­tion that his client’s of­fence was a one-off in­ci­dent and she had not ben­e­fited in any way from it.</p>
    <p>Ee is among sev­eral of the wine com­pany’s for­mer em­ploy­ees who were ear­lier charged with cor­rup­tion of­fences. They in­clude Yip, 74; for­mer chief executive Lim Yok Lyn, 47; and for­mer sales executive Mi­cael Mu­soni, 31.</p>
    <p>Their cases are still pend­ing.</p>
