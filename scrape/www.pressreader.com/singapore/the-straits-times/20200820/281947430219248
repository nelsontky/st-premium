    <p>YUMA • Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said he called off last week­end’s trade talks with China, rais­ing ques­tions about the fu­ture of a trade deal that is now the most sta­ble point in an in­creas­ingly tense re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>“I can­celled talks with China,” he said on Tues­day in Yuma, Ari­zona. “I don’t want to talk to China right now.”</p>
    <p>The phase one trade deal, which came into force in Fe­bru­ary, had called for dis­cus­sions on its im­ple­men­ta­tion ev­ery six months.</p>
    <p>China’s im­ports of US farm and man­u­fac­tured goods, en­ergy and ser­vices are well be­hind the pace needed to meet the first-year tar­get in­crease of US$77 bil­lion (S$105 bil­lion) over 2017 pur­chases un­der phase one of the agree­ment.</p>
    <p>But its pur­chases have in­creased as China’s econ­omy re­cov­ers from the coro­n­avirus lock­down.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese Vice-Pre­mier Liu He was sup­posed to hold a video­con­fer­ence with US Trade Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Robert Lighthizer and Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steven Mnuchin, but it was post­poned in­def­i­nitely.</p>
    <p>Talks be­tween the US and China con­tinue reg­u­larly at lower lev­els, ac­cord­ing to Mr Greg Gil­li­gan, chair­man of the Amer­i­can Cham­ber of Com­merce in China.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has been step­ping up com­plaints about China, par­tic­u­larly over the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
