    <p>Those who do not know her may be misled by her cool ap­pear­ance and think she is an heiress on a pedestal. But the first time I met Josie Ho at a Cannes Film Fes­ti­val party, we bonded im­me­di­ately and I re­alised she is a forth­right and loyal per­son.</p>
    <p>This photo shoot was resched­uled sev­eral times due to the Covid-19 pan­demic and her casino mag­nate fa­ther’s death at the end of May. Though I thought it would never ma­te­ri­alise, she did the shoot and in­ter­view like a true pro­fes­sional once she had time to grieve.</p>
    <p>One night at around 3am, she sent me a text and cheek­ily sug­gested that per­haps for this fash­ion shoot, the styling team can de­part from her cool, edgy im­age and give her a softer, more fem­i­nine look.</p>
    <p>It may be dif­fi­cult to imag­ine, but be­neath her rocker ap­pear­ance lies a del­i­cate, beat­ing heart.</p>
    <p>Fa­ther’s Day this year is the first her fam­ily spent with­out their pa­tri­arch, Stan­ley Ho. Josie posted her wed­ding pho­tos on so­cial me­dia in a trib­ute to her fa­ther. The pic­tures are from her 2003 mar­riage in Aus­tralia to ac­tor and pro­ducer Con­roy Chan, where her fa­ther walked her down the aisle.</p>
    <p>She shared de­tails of the day, with her words re­veal­ing the sense of loss her fa­ther’s death left her.</p>
    <p>Josie is the youngest daugh­ter Stan­ley Ho had with his sec­ond wife Lucina Lam. He had 17 chil­dren with his four wives. The “gam­bling king”, as he was of­ten called, show­ered ex­tra at­ten­tion on Josie in his life­time, say­ing she re­minded him of his younger self.</p>
    <p>She is the only mem­ber of the Ho clan work­ing in en­ter­tain­ment.</p>
    <p>In her in­ter­view with Icon, she says of her fa­ther: “It’s just his pas­sion for life and how he chooses to work very hard and play hard as well. So, I choose to work in a high­pres­sure in­dus­try; at the same time, I en­joy be­ing ‘in the mo­ment’.”</p>
    <p>The 45-year-old says her at­ti­tude towards work has been deeply in­flu­enced by her fa­ther – to not be afraid of fall­ing and to pick her­self up when she falls and start anew. She has held on to this be­lief in her years in en­ter­tain­ment – that even when fall­ing, fall with a smile.</p>
    <p>But her per­son­al­ity as a child is a far cry from who she is now.</p>
    <p>She says: “I was a very in­tro­verted and shy kid, I liked be­ing in my own shell and didn’t re­ally step out of my com­fort zone.”</p>
    <p>Her in­ter­est in en­ter­tain­ment was sparked by her older sis­ter Pansy, who had a group of Asian su­per­star friends. Now one of the rich­est busi­ness­women in Asia and the group ex­ec­u­tive chair­man and manag­ing di­rec­tor of Shun Tak Hold­ings, Pansy had worked on the 1981 TVB drama Break Through with the late Danny Chan Pakke­ung. She was also close to late ac­tor-singers Anita Mui and Les­lie Che­ung.</p>
    <p>Josie of­ten fol­lowed her sis­ter on out­ings and was in and out of film sets and the back­stage area of con­certs in her teenage years. She knew then that she wanted to work in en­ter­tain­ment and of­ten asked ques­tions about the in­dus­try, with celebrity friends giv­ing her ad­vice.</p>
    <p>EV­ERY FAIL­URE WAS A LEARN­ING OP­POR­TU­NITY</p>
    <p>Josie did not have a smooth ca­reer. She signed on to Rock Records as a singer at 18 in 1993, but had a hard time go­ing main­stream and was even mocked by the pub­lic, who thought she was not suited to be a singer. She later left the label.</p>
    <p>She says: “I think there were two ma­jor turn­ing points in my mu­sic ca­reer. One was hav­ing my con­tract with my label ter­mi­nated, and the other was when I de­cided to in­de­pen­dently do rock mu­sic.”</p>
    <p>When one door closes, another opens.</p>
    <p>She says: “Main­stream la­bels felt that my mu­sic was too ec­cen­tric, so they gave up on me. I had no other choice then, so I changed fo­cus and went i nto act­ing. That’s how I started star­ring in movies.”</p>
    <p>As a new­bie, she was mainly rel­e­gated to sup­port­ing roles but, to her, these were pre­cious learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>“Though I was with­out a mu­sic label then, I still con­tin­ued my singing lessons with my men­tor, who gave me good ad­vice about find­ing the dis­tinc­tive qual­ity in my own voice, in­stead of im­i­tat­ing how oth­ers sing. That is prob­a­bly the most im­por­tant les­son I’ve learnt as a singer,” she says.</p>
    <p>She got to know the indie band LMF. “We be­gan play­ing to­gether and ev­ery­one hung out with ev­ery­one – we’re like a fam­ily now. LMF later en­cour­aged me to start my own rock band, Josie & The Uni Boys.”</p>
    <p>The band, formed in 2010, is made up of Josie, Kevin Lee, Dee Lam, Don Cruz and Chan Siu-kei. They have re­leased eight al­bums in 10 years.</p>
    <p>She says: “I’m very lucky. When­ever my ca­reer is at a low, I’ll meet some­one who comes and gives me</p>
    <p>I’m very lucky. When­ever my ca­reer is at a low, I’ll meet some­one who comes and gives me guid­ance and friend­ship and en­cour­ages me to go for­ward and fight for the ca­reer I love. My life’s great­est ac­com­plish­ment is hav­ing so many men­tors I re­spect.</p>
    <p>guid­ance and friend­ship and en­cour­ages me to go for­ward and fight for the ca­reer I love. My life’s great­est ac­com­plish­ment is hav­ing so many men­tors I re­spect.”</p>
    <p>NEW MOVIE PROJECTS</p>
    <p>While Covid-19 has l ed stu­dios world­wide to post­pone pro­duc­tion and de­lay new re­leases, Josie has an­nounced sev­eral big projects.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, en­ter­tain­ment trade mag­a­zine The Hol­ly­wood Re­porter ran a story about 852 Films, the pro­duc­tion firm founded in 2009 by Josie and her hus­band, col­lab­o­rat­ing with French di­rec­tor and pro­ducer Luc Bes­son. In 2011, he pro­duced The Lady – a bio­graph­i­cal film star­ring Michelle Yeoh as Myan­marese leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Josie got to know Bes­son be­cause of their mu­tual ac­quain­tance, Yeoh.</p>
    <p>852 Films will work with Bes­son on two ac­tion fea­tures and both will star Josie as the lead­ing lady. The first is slated to start shoot­ing at the end of next year.</p>
    <p>She is also work­ing with English di­rec­tor Tony Kaye on a mu­sic­themed movie about her re­la­tion­ship with Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>There is also a movie project with Amer­i­can screen­writer Bruce Wag­ner (Maps To The Stars, 2014) ti­tled Marvel Uni­verse (no con­nec­tion to the comics) at the end of this year.</p>
    <p>Right be­fore the pan­demic hit, Josie fin­ished work on two films – Ra­jah and Habit – which are in post-pro­duc­tion. She told Icon that she in­vited Golden Globe-win­ning Ir­ish ac­tor Jonathan Rhys Mey­ers (The Tu­dors, 2007 to 2010) to film Ra­jah with her in Sarawak, Malaysia.</p>
    <p>The film is ex­ec­u­tive pro­duced by her hus­band and the story is based on Sir James Brooke, a Bri­tish ad­ven­turer and the first White Ra­jah of Sarawak from 1841 un­til his death in 1868, and his ex­ploita­tion of the lo­cals in Sarawak.</p>
    <p>“This is my first time tak­ing on a part in a movie set in colo­nial times. While the story is set in the 1840s, the is­sues of racism, so­cial jus­tice, vi­o­lence and en­vi­ron­men­tal dam­age brought up in the film are still rel­e­vant to­day.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, stream­ing ser­vice Net­flix in­tro­duced 106 Sin­ga­porean films and se­ries to its cat­a­logue. In</p>
    <p>The Room (2015), an erotic drama di­rected by Eric Khoo and star­ring Josie, was among the ti­tles. The story is set in a guest room in a ho­tel be­tween the 1940s and 1990s and the love and re­la­tion­ships that change along­side it.</p>
    <p>Re­call­ing her ex­pe­ri­ences, she says: “I learnt a lot from Eric and pro­ducer Shi Nan-sun. Be­fore the shoot, the team had four days of rehearsals. This is al­most un­be­liev­able for a Hong Kong pro­ducer – to get all the artists to come and just take part in rehearsals – it’s a lux­ury.</p>
    <p>“But af­ter those rehearsals, filming did go more smoothly and ev­ery ac­tor had a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of the sub­tleties of ev­ery scene. The ex­pe­ri­ence helped me a lot and will be use­ful in my fu­ture making movies, be it act­ing or pro­duc­ing.”</p>
    <p>Josie, at 45, has had 27 years of ex­pe­ri­ence in show busi­ness, but re­tains the cu­rios­ity and hum­ble at­ti­tude of a rookie. She is con­tin­u­ously learn­ing in hopes that one day, she will achieve a sem­i­nal break­through.</p>
