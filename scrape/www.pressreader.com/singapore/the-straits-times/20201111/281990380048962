    <p>It ap­pears that many peo­ple in the United King­dom feel that the ma­jor­ity are hav­ing to make a great sac­ri­fice for the few vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple – the el­derly and chron­i­cally ill – who are most sus­cep­ti­ble to Covid-19. It is easy to be quite blase and say: “Why should I bother?” Ex­cuses for non-com­pli­ance in­clude “I’m young and will not die from it”, or “I’m al­ready old and I want to go out with all guns blaz­ing”, or even “Ah! I had the virus very early on. Let me do what­ever I want”.</p>
    <p>These ar­gu­ments have caused me to re­visit the con­cept of “so­cial con­tract”.</p>
    <p>Un­like Sin­ga­pore­ans, peo­ple in the UK do not worry about the cost of health­care. Un­der the Na­tional Health Ser­vice, there is no fear of hav­ing to pay for screen­ing, swab­bing, and even hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, noth­ing comes with­out a cost.</p>
    <p>The cost of Covid lock­downs is that a lot of peo­ple need­ing crit­i­cal care for can­cer and other med­i­cal con­di­tions are de­pri­ori­tised.</p>
    <p>When thus jux­ta­posed, it would seem ra­tional that peo­ple should take pre­cau­tions and main­tain so­cial dis­tanc­ing and other means to re­duce the spread of Covid-19, in­clud­ing self-iso­lat­ing when con­tacted to do so.</p>
    <p>In­stead there are re­ports of peo­ple throw­ing cau­tion to the wind and gath­er­ing in large num­bers to en­joy a drink or three, throw­ing large par­ties and at­tack­ing the po­lice who try to en­force the rules against such po­ten­tial “su­per spreader” events.</p>
    <p>The re­sult? A phased re­gional lock­down and now a na­tion­wide lock­down.</p>
    <p>Swe­den has been held up as an ex­am­ple where the pol­i­cy­mak­ers re­fused a na­tional lock­down. It all came down to be­ing “sen­si­ble” and mind­ful of oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Is that a pos­i­tive ex­am­ple of how a so­cial con­tract should work?</p>
    <p>If so, what other char­ac­ter­is­tics about a so­cial con­tract must we, should we, in­ves­ti­gate?</p>
