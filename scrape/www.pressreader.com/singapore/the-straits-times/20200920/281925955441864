    <p>When un­der­grad­u­ate Veveonah Mosi­bin up­loaded a video of her­self climb­ing a tree in the north­ern tip of Sabah in June to get In­ter­net access for an on­line exam, it quickly be­came a vi­ral icon of the lack of in­fras­truc­tural de­vel­op­ment in Malaysia’s sec­ond-poor­est state.</p>
    <p>But it was only when snap polls were called in July – af­ter de­fec­tors de­prived Chief Min­is­ter Shafie Ap­dal of con­trol of the state leg­is­la­ture – that it be­came a touch­pa­per po­lit­i­cal is­sue.</p>
    <p>Two deputy min­is­ters have had to apol­o­gise af­ter draw­ing pub­lic anger this month for ac­cus­ing Ms Veveonah of fab­ri­cat­ing the lack of In­ter­net con­nec­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Now, politi­cians from both sides of the di­vide are ral­ly­ing to her cause, with Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin himself mak­ing time to have din­ner with the youth from Pi­tas.</p>
    <p>He did this last week be­tween ad­min­is­ter­ing a na­tion re­cov­er­ing from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and cam­paign­ing across Sabah for the Sept 26 vote that could make or break his premier­ship.</p>
    <p>Sub-par In­ter­net access in Malaysia’s eastern-most state is just the lat­est ex­am­ple that Saba­hans cite of con­tin­ued ne­glect by the fed­eral gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Decades of dis­con­tent have sim­mered into a nearly univer­sal “an­tiMalaya” (the his­tor­i­cal name for Penin­su­lar Malaysia) sen­ti­ment across the state.</p>
    <p>Un­like most of the penin­sula, Sabah lacks a com­pre­hen­sive road net­work. The 170km jour­ney from the state cap­i­tal to Ms Veveonah’s home takes close to four hours, the same as travers­ing twice the dis­tance from Jo­hor Baru to Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>Saba­hans also suf­fer an av­er­age of four hours of power out­age a year, nearly five times that of their coun­try­men in the west, and their me­dian monthly house­hold in­come of RM4,235 (S$1,399) is less than the RM5,873 na­tion­ally.</p>
    <p>Th­ese are among the fac­tors that have led to a surge of na­tivist pol­i­tics among Saba­hans.</p>
    <p>They claim that rights and guar­an­tees un­der the Malaysia Agree­ment 1963 (MA63) – which bound the state with Malaya, Sarawak and Sin­ga­pore (un­til it was ejected two years later) as one na­tion – have been de­nied.</p>
    <p>This push in Sabah for the in­ter­ests of na­tive in­hab­i­tants has been ex­ac­er­bated by anger over the unchecked flood of mi­grants from neigh­bour­ing In­done­sia but more so the Philip­pines, where gueril­las from the coun­try’s restive south launched an in­va­sion of Sabah’s east coast in 2013.</p>
    <p>A sur­vey by the So­ci­ety Em­pow­er­ment & Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment of Sabah (Seeds) think-tank at the end of Au­gust found that MA63 and mi­grants with­out per­mis­sion (PTI) were iden­ti­fied by more than 71 per cent of re­spon­dents as is­sues that would in­flu­ence their vote.</p>
    <p>Th­ese is­sues were bet­tered only by the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion’s aid pro­gramme to cush­ion cit­i­zens from the Covid-19 fall­out.</p>
    <p>Seeds chair­man Arnold Puyok told The Sun­day Times the re­sults showed how eco­nomic con­cerns drive th­ese na­tivist is­sues.</p>
    <p>“When we ask fur­ther, they equate MA63 with oil roy­al­ties,” he said, re­fer­ring to the dis­pute be­tween the state and fed­eral gov­ern­ments over the ex­ist­ing 5 per cent quan­tum. Sabah wants 20 per cent of the oil roy­al­ties in­stead.</p>
    <p>“Even when you ask about PTI, they re­late it to loss of jobs and op­por­tu­nity,” Mr Puyok said.</p>
    <p>PTI is an um­brella term for refugees, both doc­u­mented and un­doc­u­mented over­stay­ing mi­grants as well as those con­tro­ver­sially granted cit­i­zen­ship.</p>
    <p>Mus­lim-based rul­ing par­ties are ac­cused of hand­ing thou­sands of iden­ti­fi­ca­tion cards (ICs) to mi­grants as early as the 1970s, with “Project IC” in the 1990s dur­ing Umno’s rule seen as the most bla­tant at­tempt to tip the elec­toral scales in their favour.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Sabah-based In­sti­tute for De­vel­op­ment Stud­ies, three in 10 of the state’s 3.9 mil­lion pop­u­la­tion are il­le­gals.</p>
    <p>“In the penin­sula, the PTI might mostly be work­ing in con­struc­tion or plan­ta­tions only but in Sabah, they are work­ing in sa­lons, mas­sage par­lours and sell­ing wares in the mar­ket. Th­ese are jobs that lo­cals want to do,” driver By­ron Ko­juna, 39, told ST.</p>
    <p>Both Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s al­lies in the newly-formed Gabun­gan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) – made up of the Umno-led Barisan Na­sional, Parti Ber­satu Sabah and his own Perikatan Na­sional coali­tion – and Datuk Seri Shafie’s Warisan Plus pact have placed MA63 and PTI at the top of their elec­tion man­i­festos that fo­cus strongly on eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Aside from the RM2.4 bil­lion ear­marked to im­prove In­ter­net access, the Premier has in­sisted that hav­ing both fed­eral and state gov­ern­ments from the same coali­tion would boost Sabah’s rights un­der MA63, in­clud­ing the for­ma­tion of a Sabah Pe­tro­leum Coun­cil and Pet­ros­abah Fund.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Parti Warisan Sabah chief, Mr Shafie, is rid­ing the an­tiMalaya wave, call­ing on vot­ers to put their trust in his lo­cal party rather than the fed­eral rul­ing coali­tion. But the in­cum­bent chief min­is­ter has also faced ac­cu­sa­tions from GRS com­po­nents that he is soft on im­mi­gra­tion, and that the Tem­po­rary Sabah Pass pro­posed ear­lier was an ef­fort to le­galise them.</p>
    <p>Although the state gov­ern­ment in­sisted the pro­gramme was meant to weed out mi­grants with fake doc­u­men­ta­tion, it even­tu­ally can­celled it af­ter crit­i­cism of the scheme led to its de­feat in the Ki­ma­nis by-elec­tion in Jan­uary.</p>
