    <p>JO­HOR BARU • A Jo­hor as­sem­bly­man has urged the state gov­ern­ment to set up a task force to re­view the open­ing of the two land cross­ings be­tween the Malaysian state and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Bekok as­sem­bly­man S. Ra­makr­ish­nan said the fo­cus should be to re­duce the time pe­riod and cost of fol­low­ing Covid-19 health pro­ce­dures while cross­ing the bor­der.</p>
    <p>“Lab­o­ra­tory test­ing fa­cil­i­ties must be at the site of en­try in view of the num­ber of peo­ple cross­ing so that re­sults can be re­ceived much faster.</p>
    <p>“The cost of test­ing should also be looked at, in­clud­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of it be­ing sub­sidised,” he said.</p>
    <p>Bekok con­stituency is lo­cated near Sega­mat in cen­tral Jo­hor.</p>
    <p>Dr Ra­makr­ish­nan was com­ment­ing on The Star’s re­cent re­port on Jo­hor Men­teri Be­sar Hasni Mo­ham­mad say­ing the state gov­ern­ment was not ca­pa­ble of find­ing em­ploy­ment for 100,000 Malaysians who may lose their jobs be­cause of the pro­longed clo­sure.</p>
    <p>The bor­ders have been closed to daily com­muters since March 18, when Malaysia im­posed a move­ment con­trol or­der be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Datuk Hasni had added that the state’s un­em­ploy­ment rate was al­ready at a record high of 18 per cent, with 35,000 peo­ple job­less.</p>
    <p>Dr Ra­makr­ish­nan said the large num­ber of Malaysian work­ers in Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore­ans cross­ing the bor­der for shop­ping, en­ter­tain­ment and tourism was crit­i­cal for the state’s econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately, the state gov­ern­ment did not show any ur­gency in open­ing the bor­der much ear­lier. Know­ing the ur­gency of the mat­ter now, steps should have been taken to shorten the quar­an­tine pe­riod and re­duce the cost of Covid-19 tests with min­i­mum in­ter­rup­tion to cross-bor­der trav­el­ling.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately, this mat­ter (the bor­der re­open­ing) was left to the fed­eral gov­ern­ment to han­dle,” he said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>He said devel­op­ment agen­cies such as Iskan­dar Re­gional Devel­op­ment Au­thor­ity should be proac­tive and ag­gres­sive in at­tract­ing more for­eign di­rect in­vest­ments to Jo­hor. “So far, in­vest­ments from China seem fo­cused on prop­erty devel­op­ment, and there­fore we need more in­vest­ments from other coun­tries and MNCs (multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions) fo­cused more on non-prop­erty sec­tors.”</p>
    <p>He also sug­gested that the state gov­ern­ment needed to de­velop in­fras­truc­ture for the dig­i­tal econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Mr Hasni had ear­lier said: “The time has come for the fed­eral gov­ern­ment to find a way to bal­ance the peo­ple’s lives and their liveli­hoods, as we do not want the scale to tip only to­wards lives due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Mr Hasni said that 5 per cent to 10 per cent of busi­nesses in the Jo­hor Baru city area had closed as a re­sult of cash flow is­sues since the bor­der clo­sure in March.</p>
    <p>He also said he was in touch with Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin to find a way to keep the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion un­der con­trol while mov­ing to fully re­open the bor­der.</p>
    <p>Mr Hasni said that 5 per cent to 10 per cent of busi­nesses in the Jo­hor Baru city area had closed as a re­sult of cash flow is­sues since the bor­der clo­sure in March.</p>
