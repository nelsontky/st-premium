    <p>The Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore (Muis) and the Sin­ga­pore Food Agency (SFA) are look­ing into al­le­ga­tions about a car­tel’s pack­ag­ing and sale of ha­lal-certified meat in Malaysia, to de­ter­mine if the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket is af­fected by the pur­ported mis­con­duct.</p>
    <p>Re­cent me­dia re­ports in Malaysia have al­leged that the car­tel smug­gles, repacks and re-la­bels non-ha­lal frozen meat items as ha­lal-certified, the two or­gan­i­sa­tions noted in a joint state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Muis and SFA said that only meat and meat prod­ucts from SFA-ac­cred­ited over­seas es­tab­lish­ments can be im­ported into Sin­ga­pore, and these im­ported goods are also sub­jected to the agency’s food safety sur­veil­lance pro­gramme to en­sure that they meet im­port re­quire­ments and reg­u­la­tory stan­dards.</p>
    <p>Meat which is im­ported for the Mus­lim mar­ket and Muis’ cer­tifi­cate hold­ers also need to meet ha­lal re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>“Muis as­sures the pub­lic that the ha­lal-certified meat prod­ucts which are legally im­ported into Sin­ga­pore may be con­sumed with con­fi­dence,” the state­ment said, adding that con­sumers are ad­vised to ex­er­cise cau­tion when pur­chas­ing meat prod­ucts over­seas.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that mes­sages have cir­cu­lated on social me­dia ex­press­ing con­cern that the frozen meat prod­ucts could have been im­ported into Sin­ga­pore, and that the al­leged im­pro­pri­eties in im­port­ing and pack­ag­ing ha­lal meat could also be tak­ing place in the Repub­lic, Muis and SFA said that they are look­ing into the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Muis also said it is seek­ing more in­for­ma­tion from the rel­e­vant author­ity in Malaysia, and urged peo­ple against spread­ing ru­mours and to ver­ify that their in­for­ma­tion is from cred­i­ble sources.</p>
    <p>The car­tel is be­ing in­ves­ti­gated by Malaysia’s Spe­cial In­ves­ti­ga­tion Unit.</p>
