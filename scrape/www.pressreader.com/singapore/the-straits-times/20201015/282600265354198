    <p>MON­TREAL • Former Cana­dian pro­ducer Gilbert Ro­zon (left) went on trial on Tues­day on charges of sex­ual as­sault and ha­rass­ment.</p>
    <p>Af­ter be­ing de­layed in June due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the trial is ex­pected to l ast all week.</p>
    <p>Ro­zon, 65, was charged in De­cem­ber 2018 over events that al­legedly oc­curred in 1979 in­volv­ing a vic­tim whose iden­tity was not re­vealed. The Que­bec public pros­e­cu­tor’s of­fice did not file charges from 13 other al­leged vic­tims.</p>
    <p>Nine women went public in Oc­to­ber 2017 with al­le­ga­tions of sex­ual mis­con­duct by Ro­zon, trig­ger­ing a shock wave in Que­bec hard on the heels of the rev­e­la­tions tar­get­ing dis­graced Hol­ly­wood mogul Har­vey Weinstein and at the peak of the #MeToo move­ment.</p>
    <p>Ro­zon founded Mon­treal’s promi­nent Just For Laughs com­edy fes­ti­val and was a jury mem­ber on the com­pe­ti­tion show France Has In­cred­i­ble Talent, France’s an­swer to Amer­ica’s Got Talent.</p>
    <p>His al­leged vic­tim at the trial was 20 years old on the night in ques­tion. She had gone to a club with Ro­zon, whom she knew.</p>
    <p>Be­fore he took her home, he said he needed to get some pa­pers from his sec­re­tary’s house, which is where the as­sault took place, the plain­tiff said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“He threw him­self on me,” she said, ex­plain­ing that Ro­zon had tried to kiss her be­fore rap­ing her a few hours later, ac­cord­ing to the ac­count of her tes­ti­mony given by the tele­vi­sion chan­nel TVA.</p>
    <p>Ro­zon, who de­nies the ac­cu­sa­tions, pleaded not guilty and in­di­cated he in­tends to tes­tify.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been wait­ing for this mo­ment for a very long time and I won’t hide from you that we’re a lit­tle anx­ious about the out­come of this trial. But at the same time this is what we wanted. He has to be brought to jus­tice,” Que­be­cois ac­tress Pa­tri­cia Tu­lasne, spokesman for Les Courageuse­s (Brave Women), told re­porters.</p>
    <p>Les Courageuse­s is a group of women all of whom say they are vic­tims of the fallen pro­ducer, who has “at least 20 vic­tims over a pe­riod of 34 years, from 1982 to 2016”, an ac­cu­sa­tion that Ro­zon firmly re­futes.</p>
    <p>The group filed a class ac­tion law­suit against Ro­zon seek­ing dam­ages, which was dis­missed by the Que­bec Court of Ap­peal in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Three years ago, in the wake of the ac­cu­sa­tions against Ro­zon and Weinstein, French tele­vi­sion chan­nels M6 and C8 re­moved from air the shows Ro­zon had worked on.</p>
    <p>Com­edy group Just For Laughs, in cri­sis fol­low­ing the al­le­ga­tions against its founder, was bought in March 2018 by Los An­ge­les-based talent agency ICM Part­ners and Cana­dian co­me­dian Howie Mandel.</p>
