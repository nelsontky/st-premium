    <p>With the cur­rent leg­isla­tive term in Ger­many wind­ing down in less than a year, two min­is­ters are ramp­ing up pres­sure for a so­called sup­ply chain law.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed law would man­date that com­pa­nies with more than 500 em­ploy­ees con­duct due dili­gence on hu­man rights and labour stan­dards among their busi­ness part­ners. If im­ple­mented, it would have far-reach­ing con­se­quences in Ger­many and beyond.</p>
    <p>The law will en­sure, for ex­am­ple, that the beans of the cof­fee sold in local su­per­mar­kets are not har­vested by chil­dren, clothes are not pro­duced un­der mis­er­able work­ing con­di­tions or rivers are not pol­luted by fac­to­ries.</p>
    <p>In 2012, a fire in a gar­ment fac­tory in Dhaka, Bangladesh, that caused the death of over 100 work­ers trig­gered a fierce de­bate in Europe over labour con­di­tions in low-wage coun­tries. The com­pany had also pro­duced goods for re­tail­ers based in Europe.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man ini­tia­tive gained new mo­men­tum when ef­forts to ask com­pa­nies to vol­un­tar­ily look into the hu­man rights stan­dards of their part­ners pro­duced poor re­sults. This was de­spite Ber­lin hav­ing adopted a Na­tional Ac­tion Plan in 2016 to im­ple­ment prin­ci­ples on busi­ness and hu­man rights brought for­ward by the United Na­tions.</p>
    <p>When en­ter­prises with more than 500 em­ploy­ees were asked to pro­vide in­for­ma­tion on their due dili­gence, only about 450 out of over 2,250 re­sponded. Of those 450, only about 20 per cent had ac­tu­ally put the rec­om­men­da­tions into prac­tice.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment Gerd Muller and Min­is­ter for Labour and So­cial Af­fairs Hu­ber­tus Heil – a Con­ser­va­tive and a So­cial Demo­crat, re­spec­tively – are urg­ing the gov­ern­ment to draft and pass a sup­ply chain law.</p>
    <p>If ap­proved, com­pa­nies will face le­gal ac­tion if they ne­glect hu­man right abuses like child abuse or non-com­pli­ance with en­vi­ron­men­tal stan­dards.</p>
    <p>As the law ap­plies to the en­tire sup­ply chain, sup­pli­ers from other coun­tries – in­clud­ing places where raw ma­te­ri­als are ex­tracted and as­sem­bled – must also com­ply with the reg­u­la­tions. Pun­ish­ments could range from fines to sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>“The ex­ploita­tion of peo­ple, na­ture, and child labour must not be­come the ba­sis of the global econ­omy and our pros­per­ity,” said Mr Muller.</p>
    <p>Mr Man­fred We­ber, leader of the con­ser­va­tive Euro­pean Peo­ple’s Party, the largest po­lit­i­cal frac­tion in the Euro­pean Par­lia­ment, be­lieves such a law should be passed on a Euro­pean level.</p>
    <p>“Europe should take ad­van­tage of its eco­nomic power to boost the val­ues it stands for,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“At the same time, we have to safe­guard growth... This is par­tic­u­larly true with re­gard to the dy­namism we see in Asian mar­kets,” he added.</p>
    <p>A re­cent sur­vey in­di­cated that 75 per cent of Ger­mans sup­port the law. And about the same per­cent­age is con­vinced that those af­fected by hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions must be al­lowed to sue for com­pen­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>But busi­ness as­so­ci­a­tions are warn­ing of al­most in­sur­mount­able hur­dles for smaller com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>“One can­not ask medium-sized com­pa­nies to as­sume re­spon­si­bil­ity for com­pli­ance with hu­man rights through­out the en­tire value chain,” said Ms Anne Lauen­roth, deputy head of the depart­ment of se­cu­rity and re­sources at the Fed­er­a­tion of Ger­man In­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>Sup­ply chains can be very com­plex and of­ten com­prise more than 100 stages. The as­so­ci­a­tion says li­a­bil­ity should at least be lim­ited to Tier-1 sup­pli­ers. This would in­clude only the last stage of the chain be­fore the prod­uct is put on the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics also say only com­pa­nies with more than 5,000 em­ploy­ees should fall un­der the law.</p>
    <p>“If the law does not suf­fi­ciently take into ac­count the sit­u­a­tion of smaller busi­nesses, there is a great dan­ger that Ger­man com­pa­nies will suf­fer com­pet­i­tive dis­ad­van­tages”, Ms Lauen­roth said. “We must not forget that we cur­rently find our­selves in a sys­temic com­pe­ti­tion with China. There­fore our mar­ket power has clear lim­i­ta­tions.”</p>
    <p>While China is solidly re­cov­er­ing from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, coun­tries in the euro zone are strug­gling with an eco­nomic slump of well over 7 per cent this year, said a re­cent forecast by the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>But the lines be­tween sup­port­ers and op­po­nents of the law are not clearly drawn. Even large com­pa­nies such as Pri­mark, an Ir­ish fast-fash­ion re­tailer, and the Ger­man tex­tile dis­count store KIK, both known for their su­per cheap pric­ing, are among ad­vo­cates for the law.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 42 com­pa­nies have joined ranks to pro­mote the law. They be­lieve that cre­at­ing a level play­ing field will serve them bet­ter than the cur­rent con­fus­ing mix of guide­lines and rec­om­men­da­tions.</p>
