    <p>Brazil and sev­eral other Latin Amer­i­can coun­tries have in­formed the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) that they need more time to sign up for its global Covid-19 vac­cine al­lo­ca­tion plan known as Co­vax, of­fi­cials have said.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries had un­til yes­ter­day mid­night to for­malise legally bind­ing com­mit­ments to Co­vax, a mech­a­nism for pooled pro­cure­ment and eq­ui­table dis­tri­bu­tion of even­tual vac­cines.</p>
    <p>A rep­re­sen­ta­tive for the Gavi Al­liance, the Co­vax sec­re­tar­iat that will han­dle the re­quests for an ex­ten­sion, said by e-mail that de­tails of which na­tions have joined Co­vax, an US$18 bil­lion (S$24.4 bil­lion) ini­tia­tive, will be made public only af­ter the dead­line.</p>
    <p>“The fed­eral gov­ern­ment, as well as other coun­tries, con­tin­ues in talks with Gavi to ex­tend the dead­line for for­mal­is­ing Brazil’s par­tic­i­pa­tion in the ini­tia­tive,” a Brazil­ian state­ment on Thurs­day said.</p>
    <p>Brazil, which has the world’s most se­vere out­break out­side the United States and In­dia, said more time was needed to gather in­for­ma­tion on reg­u­la­tory, le­gal, stor­age and lo­gis­ti­cal is­sues.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials in Mex­ico, which has the worst out­break in Latin Amer­ica af­ter Brazil, said their coun­try would sign the com­mit­ment on time be­fore the dead­line.</p>
    <p>More than 170 coun­tries have joined the global vac­cine plan to help buy and dis­trib­ute im­mu­ni­sa­tion shots for Covid-19 fairly around the world, WHO direc­tor-gen­eral Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus said on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Dr Jar­bas Bar­bosa, as­sis­tant direc­tor of the PanAmer­i­can Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, said in a brief­ing on Wed­nes­day that Latin Amer­i­can coun­tries were hav­ing trou­ble meet­ing the dead­line, and some wanted to push back the date.</p>
    <p>Dr Bar­bosa said all coun­tries in the Amer­i­cas ex­cept the United States had ex­pressed in­ter­est in the vac­cine fa­cil­ity, even those that have sep­a­rate agree­ments with vac­cine mak­ers, be­cause it gives them an added guar­an­tee of ac­cess to doses.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, China faces a ma­jor test in its vac­cine diplo­macy, as it de­cides whether it will of­fi­cially join Co­vax. Bei­jing has said that it sup­ports Co­vax, with­out clearly say­ing if it is putting any money into the pro­ject. Sign­ing up would help to re­pair China’s im­age around the world over how it han­dled the ini­tial out­break in Wuhan, par­tic­u­larly since the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has re­fused to join Co­vax.</p>
    <p>So far, Bei­jing has fo­cused on cut­ting one-on-one deals for vac­cine doses with friendly gov­ern­ments.</p>
