    <p>The PAP needs to re­dou­ble ef­forts to help work­ers</p>
    <p>There is a dan­ger that in its soul-search­ing, the PAP wants to be ev­ery­thing to ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>It must not.</p>
    <p>As a cen­tre-right, con­ser­va­tive party, the PAP’s ri­val is an al­liance of two dis­tinct groups.</p>
    <p>The first is the pro­gres­sive, lib­eral de­mo­graphic whose views are now trend­ing on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>They now be­lieve that the im­proved per­for­mance of the op­po­si­tion is due to their power in re­ject­ing what they per­ceive to be con­ser­va­tive, au­thor­i­tar­ian poli­cies of the PAP. They per­ceive the in­cum­bent to be un­fair and anti-demo­cratic.</p>
    <p>Their op­po­si­tion to the PAP is ide­o­log­i­cal.</p>
    <p>They want al­ter­na­tives and di­ver­sity in Par­lia­ment, even if they ac­knowl­edge the PAP has gov­erned well on bread-and-but­ter is­sues.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond pil­lar of the op­po­si­tion al­liance is the work­ing and mid­dle class who have been left be­hind eco­nom­i­cally.</p>
    <p>They are an­gry that even as the coun­try pros­pers, their dreams are thwarted. They be­lieve that for­eign­ers have un­fairly stolen their jobs. They are wor­ried about their CPF and ris­ing costs of liv­ing.</p>
    <p>Their ob­jec­tion to the PAP is prac­ti­cal, not ide­o­log­i­cal.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­net world would have you be­lieve, with­out a shred of ev­i­dence, that it is the first group that swung a bet­ter re­sult to the op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>But let’s leave that aside, be­cause this post is not about analysing psepho­log­i­cal trends, but what the PAP should do.</p>
    <p>The temp­ta­tion is to now try to court the young ide­o­logues, and the pseudo-Western lib­er­als.</p>
    <p>I would cau­tion against this.</p>
    <p>Is this group say­ing that if the PAP had been gen­tler on Ms Raeesah Khan, if Pofma</p>
    <p>(Pro­tec­tion from On­line False­hoods and Ma­nip­u­la­tion Act) is re­pealed, and if the ELD (Elec­tions Depart­ment) is made in­de­pen­dent, etc, they would vote for the PAP?</p>
    <p>Come off it.</p>
    <p>The main de­sire of this group is for Sin­ga­pore to be­come more like Western democ­ra­cies, to have a two- or mul­ti­ple-party sys­tem, and to have more al­ter­na­tives in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>The only thing that the PAP can do to ful­fil this de­sire is to in­ten­tion­ally lose, or to gift seats to the op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>This is of course lu­di­crous.</p>
    <p>In its soul-search­ing, the PAP should re­gard this fac­tion of op­po­si­tion sup­port­ers to be a lost cause. In­stead, it should fo­cus on the sec­ond group.</p>
    <p>Thank­fully, the PAP is one of the most adap­tive and ef­fi­cient par­ties in the world in solv­ing bread-and but­ter is­sues.</p>
    <p>Fo­cus on ful­fill­ing the prom­ises in its man­i­festo.</p>
    <p>Cre­ate jobs.</p>
    <p>Help the poor and strug­gling. Em­power Sin­ga­pore­ans to com­pete ef­fec­tively in a glob­alised econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Re­dou­ble ef­forts to up­lift the</p>
    <p>40- to 60-year-old PMETs in most dan­ger of los­ing their jobs in the up­com­ing re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>In other words, con­tinue do­ing what it has done well that made it one of the long­est-rul­ing par­ties in the world.</p>
    <p>This is in fact the strat­egy suc­cess­fully taken by right-of-cen­tre par­ties across the world, in evis­cer­at­ing their left-lib­eral ri­vals.</p>
    <p>The al­liance be­tween the cham­pagne so­cial­ists and the strug­gling work­ing class is an in­her­ently un­sta­ble one.</p>
    <p>If the PAP can show its com­pe­tence in help­ing the work­ing class, the al­liance will break.</p>
    <p>The lib­eral ide­o­logues by them­selves can­not win elec­tions.</p>
    <p>In Bri­tain, the Con­ser­va­tives an­ni­hi­lated a Labour Party taken over by Mo­men­tum, mostly young, pro­gres­sive ide­o­logues.</p>
    <p>How? By win­ning over the tra­di­tional vote bank of Labour, the work­ing class.</p>
    <p>Like in busi­ness, po­lit­i­cal par­ties must know their core com­pe­tency. Try­ing to be ev­ery­thing to ev­ery­one will fail.</p>
    <p>If the PAP sticks to its strengths and con­tin­ues to fo­cus on solv­ing bread-and-but­ter is­sues, it can slow and maybe even re­v­erse losses in fu­ture elec­tions.</p>
    <p>This will leave mainly the in­tel­li­gentsia, the well-to-do pro­gres­sives, and the young ide­al­ists as the main sup­port­ers of the Work­ers’ Party.</p>
    <p>The Work­ers’ Party will be­come the party of the lib­eral elite.</p>
    <p>And, in a great piece of irony, con­versely, the only thing that can strengthen the PAP, is to help the work­ers: the PAP must be­come the work­ers’ party.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor turn­ing point MANO SABNANI</p>
    <p>We have ar­rived at a ma­jor turn­ing point in our po­lit­i­cal de­vel­op­ment. Since in­de­pen­dence in 1965, Sin­ga­pore has not had a sit­u­a­tion where our Par­lia­ment has fea­tured a party, other than the PAP, that could play a sub­stan­tive role in the man­age­ment of the coun­try’s af­fairs.</p>
    <p>We are now at the cusp of that. Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong has been quick in offering the of­fi­cial role of Leader of the Op­po­si­tion to Mr Pri­tam Singh, leader of the resur­gent Work­ers’ Party which will have 10 sit­ting mem­bers in the new Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>The WP con­sid­ers it­self loyal to Sin­ga­pore and al­ways work­ing in the in­ter­ests of Sin­ga­pore­ans. It does not op­pose for the sake of op­pos­ing and has also sup­ported the Gov­ern­ment on many is­sues, in­ter­nal as well as ex­ter­nal.</p>
    <p>The PAP is more wel­com­ing of this sort of re­spon­si­ble op­po­si­tion and some vot­ers have taken their cue from that, back­ing the WP strongly in all its con­tests and en­abling it to achieve a good 50 per cent pop­u­lar vote in the 21 seats that it con­tested.</p>
    <p>As Op­po­si­tion Leader, Mr Singh will be given re­sources to re­search and de­velop poli­cies and of­fer more sound al­ter­na­tives.</p>
    <p>I think it also means the WP will have more clout to make the Gov­ern­ment more trans­par­ent and ac­count­able. If this hap­pens, it will be a ma­jor break­through for al­ter­na­tive par­ties which have been push­ing on this front.</p>
    <p>The break­through, if it comes, will not be a mo­ment too late. It has been a key griev­ance in GE2020, es­pe­cially among young, ed­u­cated vot­ers whose num­bers are grow­ing and their ef­fect ev­i­dent in the lat­est re­sults.</p>
    <p>We are not yet at the stage where Sin­ga­pore has a two- or three-party democ­racy. But we are get­ting there.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the WP, there is the fledg­ling Progress Sin­ga­pore Party (PSP) which scored an av­er­age of 40 per cent of the pop­u­lar vote in GE2020, in the 24 con­tested seats.</p>
    <p>That is an as­ton­ish­ing achieve­ment even though the PSP ended up with only an of­fer of two Non-Con­stituency MP best-loser seats.</p>
    <p>PSP leader Tan Cheng Bock has promised the party will be re­ju­ve­nated, hope­fully with more younger lead­ers, and work in con­tested seats for the next gen­eral elec­tion, likely in 2024/2025.</p>
    <p>The PAP, on its part, re­tains the su­per-majority it has held in Par­lia­ment since 1965. It will rule with 83 out of 93 seats in the new Par­lia­ment. It can amend the Con­sti­tu­tion of the coun­try at will, as it has in the past.</p>
    <p>But it needs to do some soul-search­ing on its part.</p>
    <p>Specif­i­cally, should the party con­tinue to im­pose the Whip to bring all its MPs in line on im­por­tant res­o­lu­tions? Up to now, PAP MPs speak up on par­lia­men­tary mo­tions and some­times of­fer con­trar­ian views. But when the time comes to vote, they have no choice. The PAP, for its own good, needs to al­low its MPs, es­pe­cially younger ones, to man­i­fest their youth, en­ergy and cre­ativ­ity. Let them vote as they wish on is­sues and get a real gauge of ground sen­ti­ment.</p>
