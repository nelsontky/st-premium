    <p>AS­SO­CIATE PRO­FES­SOR BEN­JAMIN ONG</p>
    <p>MOH im­me­di­ate past di­rec­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices Mer­i­to­ri­ous Ser­vice Medal</p>
    <p>It was with mixed feel­ings that As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ben­jamin Ong left his role as di­rec­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices (DMS) at the Min­istry of Health (MOH) in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus was sweep­ing the world, and Sin­ga­pore had just de­tected its first case of Covid-19 on Jan 23.</p>
    <p>For some­one who en­tered the med­i­cal pro­fes­sion be­cause he wanted to serve the pub­lic, it was not easy for Prof Ong to walk away.</p>
    <p>But the neu­rol­o­gist, who re­turned to the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore as se­nior vice-pres­i­dent of health ed­u­ca­tion and re­sources, knew he had left things in the “very good hands” of As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ken­neth Mak and other col­leagues.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases, which Prof Ong was in­stru­men­tal in set­ting up, had also just opened last year and was ready to play a cen­tral role in Sin­ga­pore’s fight against Sars-Cov-2. Recog­nis­ing his ef­forts, the MOH said in his ci­ta­tion for the Na­tional Day Award that “this has placed Sin­ga­pore in a bet­ter stead to deal with the cur­rent Covid-19 out­break”.</p>
    <p>Prof Ong, 63, down­plays his part, em­pha­sis­ing that he was part of a team: “I’m the prod­uct of very good men­tors, teach­ers and col­leagues.”</p>
    <p>Look­ing back on his six years as DMS, he said: “Be­ing able to play a part in plan­ning for stronger sys­tems, in terms of pre­vent­ing and re­spond­ing to the kind of shocks we are cur­rently fac­ing, has been quite ful­fill­ing.</p>
    <p>“What would give me the most sat­is­fac­tion is watch­ing a new gen­er­a­tion get bet­ter than we are and watch­ing the struc­tures we had a small part in de­vel­op­ing help us to cope with the fu­ture.”</p>
