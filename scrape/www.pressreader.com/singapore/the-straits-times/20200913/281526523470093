    <p>Look no fur­ther than out­go­ing Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe for proof that po­lit­i­cal dy­nas­ties have long been en­trenched in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>His late ma­ter­nal grand­fa­ther, Nobusuke Kishi, was prime min­is­ter from 1957 to 1960. This was fol­lowed by great-un­cle Eisaku Sato, who led from 1964 to 1972.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe’s own fa­ther, Shin­taro Abe, held such po­si­tions as chief Cabi­net sec­re­tary from 1977 to 1978, trade min­is­ter from 1981 to 1982, and for­eign min­is­ter from 1982 to 1986.</p>
    <p>Shinzo Abe, 65, will con­tinue as MP af­ter he steps down as prime min­is­ter, while his brother Nobuo Kishi, who was adopted into his ma­ter­nal par­ents’ fam­ily soon af­ter birth, is also a politi­cian.</p>
    <p>But whether Mr Kishi, 61, who has been MP for his home­town con­stituency in Ya­m­aguchi pre­fec­ture since 2004 and has held ju­nior min­is­te­rial posts, will rise to the pinnacle in Na­gat­a­cho, Ja­pan’s po­lit­i­cal nerve cen­tre, like his older brother re­mains to be seen.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe has no chil­dren, and the po­lit­i­cal dy­nasty will rely on Mr Kishi or his two sons, now a re­porter with Fuji Tele­vi­sion and an em­ployee at real es­tate firm Mit­sui Fu­dosan.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal fam­i­lies are com­mon in Ja­pan – es­pe­cially in the rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party (LDP) – with about 40 per cent of par­lia­men­tar­i­ans hail­ing from such house­holds.</p>
    <p>This makes Chief Cabi­net Sec­re­tary Yoshi­hide Suga’s rise to the cusp of the top job all the more re­mark­able. The 71-year-old is the odds-on favourite to suc­ceed Mr Abe as LDP leader in the party vote to­mor­row, with the win­ner to be in­au­gu­rated as prime min­is­ter of Ja­pan by the Diet on Wednesday.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga is the son of straw­berry farm­ers from north-east­ern Akita pre­fec­ture, and a self-made politi­cian who got his big break into pol­i­tics by pulling up his boot­straps and knock­ing on doors.</p>
    <p>His two con­tenders for the role as LDP pres­i­dent, how­ever, are po­lit­i­cal scions. For­mer for­eign min­is­ter Fu­mio Kishida, 63, is the son and grand­son of for­mer Lower House politi­cians, and counts for­mer prime min­is­ter Ki­ichi Miyazawa (1991-1993) as a dis­tant rel­a­tive.</p>
    <p>For­mer de­fence chief Shigeru Ishiba, 63, is the son of for­mer Tot­tori gov­er­nor Jiro Ishiba, who has served in gov­ern­ment po­si­tions like home af­fairs min­is­ter and ad­min­is­tra­tive vice-con­struc­tion min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>If Mr Suga were to pre­vail, he would be the first LDP leader who is not a po­lit­i­cal scion since Mr Toshiki Kaifu, who led from 1989 to 1991. His fa­ther owned a pho­tog­ra­phy stu­dio.</p>
    <p>Dr Yu Uchiyama of Univer­sity of Tokyo notes: “LDP law­mak­ers are, in many in­stances, sec­ond- or third-gen­er­a­tion suc­ces­sors to their fa­thers or grand­fa­thers.”</p>
    <p>He adds that Mr Suga would have had to over­come for­mi­da­ble chal­lenges: He has no lo­cal net­works nor name recog­ni­tion to ex­ploit, while he would not have been able to in­herit po­lit­i­cal do­na­tions that scions would have ac­cess to.</p>
