    <p>Re­searchers in Sin­ga­pore have dis­cov­ered a new vari­ant of the Covid-19 virus that causes less se­vere in­fec­tions. They have ob­served that pa­tients in­fected with the vari­ant, which is miss­ing a sec­tion in its genome, had bet­ter clin­i­cal out­comes rel­a­tive to those in­fected by viruses with­out this dele­tion.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers in Sin­ga­pore have dis­cov­ered a new vari­ant of the Covid-19 virus that causes less se­vere in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>They have ob­served that pa­tients in­fected with the vari­ant, which is miss­ing a sec­tion in its genome, had bet­ter clin­i­cal out­comes rel­a­tive to those in­fected by viruses with­out this dele­tion.</p>
    <p>A lower pro­por­tion of them, for ex­am­ple, had low blood oxy­gen (hy­poxia) or needed in­ten­sive care in hos­pi­tal, com­pared with those in­fected by the wild-type virus.</p>
    <p>These find­ings were an­nounced by the National Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases (NCID), the Agency for Science, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search’s Sin­ga­pore Im­munol­ogy Net­work and Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School at a vir­tual press brief­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>They had just been pub­lished in the pres­ti­gious jour­nal The Lancet.</p>
    <p>Mu­ta­tions oc­cur as Sars-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, spreads.</p>
    <p>The lat­est re­ported vari­ant of the virus emerged in Wuhan, China, early in the pan­demic and was ex­ported to Sin­ga­pore and Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>It was trans­mit­ted from per­son to per­son across sev­eral clus­ters here from Jan­uary to March.</p>
    <p>“One of the Covid-19 puz­zles we have been try­ing to solve is why some of our pa­tients get sick, while some have only a mild ill­ness,” Dr Barnaby Young, an NCID con­sul­tant and clin­i­cal lead for the study be­hind the find­ings, said in a re­lease.</p>
    <p>“Most of our clin­i­cal re­search ef­forts have fo­cused on the role of pa­tient fac­tors such as age and chronic med­i­cal con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>“Whether dif­fer­ent virus types are also im­por­tant has been much de­bated, but till now good ev­i­dence was lack­ing. Dis­cov­ery of this dele­tion vari­ant and that it had such a pro­found ef­fect on the in­fec­tion course is very ex­cit­ing.”</p>
    <p>So far, a few dif­fer­ent Sars-CoV-2 vari­ants have been de­tected glob­ally, in­clud­ing the D614G vari­ant that is spread­ing widely now.</p>
    <p>The new vari­ant in the study, which has a large dele­tion that re­moves the ORF8 gene, has been con­tained and not de­tected since March. “It is gone, and it is not likely to come back... but other viruses with dele­tions are ap­pear­ing” and could be­come clin­i­cally sig­nif­i­cant, said Dr Young.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar dele­tions were also de­tected with the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome virus in 2003.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers said the find­ings can have im­pli­ca­tions on the de­vel­op­ment of treat­ment and vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Dr Young said: “If we can give a treat­ment that in­hibits ORF8, maybe we can help peo­ple re­cover faster from in­fec­tion with the wild­type virus.”</p>
    <p>At the brief­ing, NCID ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Leo Yee Sin said the dis­cov­ery of the new vari­ant gen­er­ated a lot of ex­cite­ment among re­searchers as it opens up many ar­eas of in­ves­ti­ga­tion for a virus that is very new.</p>
    <p>Weigh­ing in, Pro­fes­sor Edi­son Liu, for­mer found­ing head of the Genome In­sti­tute of Sin­ga­pore and cur­rent pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive of The Jack­son Lab­o­ra­tory in the United States, said: “This is the first study to show a clin­i­cal dif­fer­ence based on the ge­netic dif­fer­ences be­tween strains.</p>
    <p>“This sug­gests that gene vari­a­tions may have an im­por­tant role in defin­ing the dis­ease out­come.”</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Hsu Li Yang, an in­fec­tious dis­eases spe­cial­ist at the National Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said Sars-CoV-2 mu­ta­tions are to be ex­pected.</p>
    <p>Most of the time, these mu­ta­tions will have lit­tle dis­cernible im­pact on the trans­mis­si­bil­ity or vir­u­lence of the virus. In rare cases, though, they may en­able the virus to spread more eas­ily, or be­come more or less deadly, he said.</p>
    <p>“In this par­tic­u­lar case, the large dele­tion re­sulted in a virus that is less deadly,” he said.</p>
    <p>If the dele­tion vari­ant is still around and be­comes very wide­spread, then the im­pact on health will be­come less, he said.</p>
    <p>“The ac­tual im­pact will de­pend on how eas­ily this par­tic­u­lar mu­tant spreads, which we do not know well at present be­cause more than 99 per cent of the virus found in pa­tients world­wide (or even in Sin­ga­pore) will not have their full genomes se­quenced.”</p>
    <p>OPEN­ING UP NEW AR­EAS OF IN­QUIRY</p>
    <p>One of the Covid-19 puz­zles we have been try­ing to solve is why some of our pa­tients get sick, while some have only a mild ill­ness. Most of our clin­i­cal re­search ef­forts have fo­cused on the role of pa­tient fac­tors such as age and chronic med­i­cal con­di­tions. Whether dif­fer­ent virus types are also im­por­tant has been much de­bated, but till now ’’ good ev­i­dence was lack­ing.
