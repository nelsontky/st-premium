    <p>LON­DON • Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer de­clared Manch­ester United’s sea­son “starts today” af­ter Bruno Fer­nan­des and “in­spi­ra­tional” Harry Maguire en­joyed sweet mo­ments of re­demp­tion in their side’s 4-1 win at Newcastle on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer’s side suf­fered a hu­mil­i­at­ing 6-1 de­feat against Tot­ten­ham at Old Traf­ford just be­fore the in­ter­na­tional break. But they made par­tial amends for that em­bar­rass­ment with a much-needed sec­ond win of the Pre­mier League sea­son.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Luke Shaw’s own goal gave Newcastle an early lead, United cap­tain Maguire scored the equaliser just days af­ter he was widely crit­i­cised for his red card in Eng­land’s Na­tions League de­feat against Den­mark at Wem­b­ley.</p>
    <p>Maguire’s first Pre­mier League goal since Fe­bru­ary was a cathar­tic mo­ment af­ter a trou­bled few months marred by poor per­for­mance on the pitch and his Greek court case off it.</p>
    <p>“Harry scored and leads by ex­am­ple. He showed good char­ac­ter, I am happy for him. He had a cou­ple of dif­fi­cult weeks since he last played for us,” Sol­sk­jaer said.</p>
    <p>Fer­nan­des also went from zero to hero as the mid­fielder’s sec­ond­half penalty was saved by Karl Dar­low – his first miss from the spot for United, be­fore he hit a su­perb strike to put United ahead in the clos­ing min­utes.</p>
    <p>The Por­tu­gal in­ter­na­tional has now been di­rectly in­volved in 20 goals in his 18 United league ap­pear</p>
    <p>Penal­ties taken by Manch­ester United’s Bruno Fer­nan­des be­fore his first miss against Newcastle. He made amends by scor­ing later. an­ces (11 goals, nine as­sists), scor­ing in the last three games.</p>
    <p>Aaron Wan-Bis­saka made it three with his first goal for United and Mar­cus Rash­ford wrapped up the late goal blitz in stop­page time.</p>
    <p>Al­though United left it late to fin­ish off Newcastle, the re­sult was no more than they de­served and Sol­sk­jaer will hope it is the start of a bet­ter pe­riod for his team af­ter their trou­bled open­ing to the cam­paign.</p>
    <p>“Great re­sult and great char­ac­ter to come back, led by a very in­spi­ra­tional cap­tain,” said the man­ager.</p>
    <p>“We don’t want to use it as an ex­cuse, but we needed pre­sea­son. We wanted to get to this in­ter­na­tional break with more points than we have, but now we know our sea­son started today, be­cause we’ve come up to the speed of the game.”</p>
    <p>Maguire also dis­missed talk of a cri­sis fol­low­ing their slow start to the sea­son.</p>
    <p>“It’s funny, three games into the sea­son and it seems like a big cri­sis. Won two, lost two. There is a long way to go, we have to im­prove,” the 27-year-old told Sky Sports.</p>
    <p>“When you play for this club and get beat at home, we ask ques­tions. We work hard in train­ing, it is a great group and we knew we had to bounce back.”</p>
