    <p>ROME/MADRID • Italy has in­tro­duced the strong­est coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions since the end of a na­tional lock­down in May, and Spain will im­pose a na­tional cur­few as cases surge in the two coun­tries at the epi­cen­tre of the ini­tial wave of the pan­demic in Europe.</p>
    <p>In Italy, Prime Min­is­ter Giuseppe Conte yes­ter­day ap­proved a plan to limit open­ing hours for bars and restau­rants, and shut en­ter­tain­ment, gam­bling venues and gyms. Ital­ians will also be urged not to travel.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures will be­gin to­day and re­main in ef­fect un­til Nov 24.</p>
    <p>Mr Conte said the mea­sures are aimed at pro­tect­ing both public health and the economy and should al­low the ris­ing curve of the epi­demic to be brought un­der con­trol in the next few weeks.</p>
    <p>“We think that we will suf­fer a bit this month but by grit­ting our teeth with these re­stric­tions, we’ll be able to breathe again in De­cem­ber,” he told a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Over in Spain, Prime Min­is­ter Pe­dro Sanchez’s Cab­i­net yes­ter­day ap­proved a new state of emer­gency that will give the cen­tral gov­ern­ment more pow­ers, and he an­nounced that t he gov­ern­ment planned a na­tional cur­few from 11pm to 6am, ex­cept in the Ca­nary Is­lands, where the coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion rate is low.</p>
    <p>The state of emer­gency will need par­lia­men­tary ap­proval to last beyond 15 days. Mr Sanchez has asked for Par­lia­ment to ap­prove its ex­ten­sion up to May 9.</p>
    <p>“The sit­u­a­tion we are go­ing through is ex­treme,” he said in a tele­vised ad­dress fol­low­ing the Cab­i­net meet­ing con­vened to dis­cuss the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The emer­gency mea­sures come in re­sponse to calls from the re­gions for pow­ers to im­pose cur­fews to fight the surge in coro­n­avirus cases, af­ter Spain last Wed­nes­day be­came the first Euro­pean coun­try to record more than a mil­lion cases of the virus.</p>
    <p>Italy and Spain had man­aged to tamp down the ini­tial wave of in­fec­tions with some of the world’s strictest na­tional lock­downs.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the eas­ing of those mea­sures be­fore the sum­mer travel sea­son contribute­d to a new wave of cases that risks over­whelm­ing the coun­tries’ health­care sys­tems if unchecked.</p>
    <p>More than 70,000 peo­ple have lost their lives from the virus in the two coun­tries, ac­count­ing for over a third of all deaths recorded in Europe, ex­clud­ing Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) has warned of an “ex­po­nen­tial” rise in in­fec­tions threat­en­ing health sys­tems’ abil­ity to cope with a sec­ond wave of cases, test­ing many na­tions that ap­peared to have the virus un­der con­trol ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Sanchez last week sig­nalled that in­fec­tions in Spain may be much more per­va­sive than the of­fi­cial data shows.</p>
    <p>More than three mil­lion peo­ple in Spain have caught the virus, he said last Fri­day, a fig­ure some three times higher than of­fi­cial numbers.</p>
    <p>To­tal cases rose to 1,046,132 last Fri­day, while the death toll is near­ing 35,000.</p>
    <p>For his part, Mr Conte has re­peat­edly ruled out a new na­tional lock­down in Italy, but he is run­ning out of op­tions as less re­stric­tive mea­sures have failed to curb the lat­est spread.</p>
    <p>New in­fec­tions rose to a record 19,644 last Satur­day and there are now more than 1,100 peo­ple be­ing treated for the virus in in­ten­sive care units.</p>
    <p>The Ital­ian gov­ern­ment may also adopt new sup­port mea­sures to limit the eco­nomic im­pact of the virus, Fi­nance Min­is­ter Roberto Gualtieri said.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment is con­sid­er­ing a €4 bil­lion to €5 bil­lion (S$6.4 bil­lion to S$8 bil­lion) emer­gency de­cree to help work­ers by ex­tend­ing fur­loughs and ban­ning dis­missals, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in France, the gov­ern­ment has ex­tended an overnight cur­few to cover areas home to around 46 mil­lion peo­ple – two out of ev­ery three French.</p>
    <p>“The dif­fer­ence com­pared with the first wave is that now we also have all the chronic patholo­gies of the win­ter pe­riod to take care of,” emer­gency doc­tor Agnes Ri­cardHi­bon told lo­cal tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Jean Cas­tex said last Satur­day that an­other €700 mil­lion would be made avail­able to help poor peo­ple who have been hit hard­est by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, WHO chief Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus warned that “too many coun­tries are see­ing an ex­po­nen­tial in­crease in Covid-19 cases and that is now lead­ing to hospi­tals and in­ten­sive care units run­ning close to or above ca­pac­ity”.</p>
    <p>He added: “We urge lead­ers to take im­me­di­ate ac­tion to pre­vent fur­ther un­nec­es­sary deaths.”</p>
    <p>Across the world, the pan­demic has now claimed the lives of 1.1 mil</p>

    <p>lion peo­ple and in­fected more than 42 mil­lion, with the WHO warn­ing that the north­ern hemi­sphere was at an es­pe­cially crit­i­cal junc­ture.</p>
    <p>The WHO’s mes­sage for na­tions to do more has been echoed by the Euro­pean Cen­tre for Dis­ease Prevention and Con­trol, but moves to rein­tro­duce re­stric­tions were met with protest in parts of the con­ti­nent.</p>
