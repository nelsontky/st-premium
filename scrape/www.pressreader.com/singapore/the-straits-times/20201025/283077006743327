    <p>With glob­al­i­sa­tion,</p>
    <p>Western technology is com­bined with cheap Asian labour to pro­duce a vast ar­ray of goods and, in­creas­ingly, ser­vices. But Asian con­sumers pur­chase only a frac­tion of what they pro­duce. China’s con­sumer spend­ing is just 39 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, com­pared with 68 per cent in the US, re­sult­ing in a sav­ing glut that is highly de­fla­tion­ary.</p>
    <p>Af­ter nose­div­ing from March through May as lock­downs dev­as­tated US house­hold spend­ing, con­sumer prices re­bounded in the fol­low­ing four months.</p>
    <p>Some fear this is the start of a resur­gence of in­fla­tion. The Fed­eral Re­serve Bank of New York’s sur­vey of con­sumer in­fla­tion ex­pec­ta­tions shows a jump from 2.4 per cent to 3 per cent for both one and three years ahead.</p>
    <p>If you think se­ri­ous in­fla­tion is com­ing, you do not be­lieve in the fun­da­men­tal power of ex­cess global sup­ply to de­press prices.</p>
    <p>With glob­al­i­sa­tion, Western technology is com­bined with cheap Asian labour to pro­duce a vast ar­ray of goods and, in­creas­ingly, ser­vices. But Asian con­sumers pur­chase only a frac­tion of what they pro­duce. China’s con­sumer spend­ing is just 39 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, com­pared with 68 per cent in the US, re­sult­ing in a sav­ing glut that is highly de­fla­tion­ary.</p>
    <p>This glut is un­likely to at­ro­phy even if the United States-China trade war in­ten­si­fies. Western and even Asian com­pa­nies such as Sam­sung, Has­bro, Ap­ple and Nintendo are shift­ing pro­duc­tion from China to Viet­nam, Pak­istan and other Asian coun­tries that have even lower costs and are out of the trade war’s line of fire.</p>
    <p>It is no sur­prise that the Fed­eral Re­serve, with all its power, has not been able to push the in­fla­tion rate to its 2 per cent target and is ad­mit­ting so by say­ing it will al­low in­fla­tion to over­shoot its target for a pe­riod of time be­fore tight­en­ing mon­e­tary pol­icy.</p>
    <p>To be sure, the Fed is not alone among cen­tral banks in fail­ing to spark in­fla­tion to an ac­cept­able level.</p>
    <p>On a mi­cro level, the pandemic has shown the power of sup­ply and de­mand to de­ter­mine prices. With many still house-bound, the cost of food at home last month was up 4.1 per cent from a year ear­lier, but at nearly de­serted schools and work­places, food costs fell 3.4 per cent, ac­cord­ing to the Bureau of Labour Statis­tics.</p>
    <p>The dif­fer­ences in in­fla­tion be­tween stay-at-home and out-and­about spend­ing were wide­spread. The con­sumer costs of recre­ational books rose 4.1 per cent last month from a year ear­lier. Ca­ble and satel­lite TV fees rose 5 per cent, news­pa­pers cost 5.6 per cent more, med­i­cal care was up 4.2 per cent, clean­ing prod­ucts prices climbed 4.5 per cent and bi­cy­cle prices jumped 1.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>Prices of things con­sumed away from home plunged, with air­line fees drop­ping 25 per cent, men’s suit jack­ets and coat prices de­clin­ing 18.7 per cent and women’s dress prices tum­bling 16.8 per cent, ho­tel room rates falling 15 per cent and city trans­porta­tion costs cra­ter­ing 16.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>Sup­ply and de­mand forces are also re­vealed in slump­ing en­ergy prices. With peo­ple stay­ing at home and not driv­ing, com­mut­ing or fly­ing, de­mand for crude oil has slumped.</p>
    <p>West Texas Inter­mediate prices have fallen from US$58 per bar­rel at the be­gin­ning of the year to a re­cent US$41 even though US frack­ers and con­ven­tional oil pro­duc­ers have cut out­put from 12 mil­lion bar­rels per day to 11 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>And that is af­ter the ear­lier drop from US$67 per bar­rel in early Oc­to­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>The Con­sumer Price In­dex (CPI) over­states in­fla­tion in a num­ber of ways, in­clud­ing its ac­count­ing for hous­ing. The statis­tics as­sume that home own­ers rent their abodes from them­selves, pay­ing mar­ket rental rates.</p>
    <p>This owner’s equiv­a­lent rent com­po­nent is large, 24 per cent of the CPI, and has risen rapidly in re­cent years as rental costs jumped along with ro­bust de­mand.</p>
    <p>Owner’s equiv­a­lent rent was up 2.5 per cent last month from a year ear­lier, but if you stripped that out, CPI edged up just 0.8 per cent in­stead of the re­ported 1.4 per cent.</p>
    <p>I doubt that many home own­ers con­sider rent paid to them­selves as part of their cost of liv­ing.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ex­ec­u­tive or­der to re­duce prescripti­on drug costs for Medi­care re­cip­i­ents to what phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies charge in other coun­tries is highly de­fla­tion­ary. In the past, Amer­i­cans have es­sen­tially paid the cost of de­vel­op­ing new drugs when for­eign gov­ern­ments buy them closer to mar­ginal costs.</p>
    <p>Spe­cial­ity branded drug costs in the US are up 62 per cent since Jan­uary 2014, com­pared with the 10 per cent rise in over­all CPI.</p>
    <p>At the same time, generic drug costs for Amer­i­cans have dropped 37 per cent. With the chronic rise in branded phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal prices, to­tal drugs, 1.5 per cent of the CPI, are up 14 per cent since Jan­uary 2014.</p>
    <p>Price spikes due to the emerg­ing Covid-19 cri­sis in the spring are be­ing re­traced as pro­duc­tion and sup­ply chains ad­just. Slaugh­ter­house closings due to in­fected plant work­ers failed to stop an­i­mals from grow­ing and adding weight. So now chicken wings and prime rib are abun­dant and cheaper than be­fore the pandemic.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s con­trac­tion of Covid-19 has brought home the per­sis­tence of the pandemic and the de­fla­tion-spawn­ing weak eco­nomic growth that lies ahead.</p>
    <p>So does the de­te­ri­o­rat­ing house­hold in­come and em­ploy­ment pic­ture. Per­sonal in­come dropped 2.7 per cent in Au­gust as the ex­tra un­em­ploy­ment in­sur­ance ben­e­fits ex­pired, and de­spite the loom­ing elec­tion, Wash­ing­ton is yet to pump more money into house­holds.</p>
    <p>Although the un­em­ploy­ment rate fell to 7.9 per cent last month from 8.4 per cent in Au­gust, that was mainly due to tem­po­rary lay­offs that be­came per­ma­nent as em­ploy­ers aban­doned hopes for a quick re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Walt Disney is ax­ing 28,000 theme park work­ers who pre­vi­ously were on tem­po­rary fur­lough, and Amer­i­can Air­lines and United Air­lines are ter­mi­nat­ing 32,000. In April, 88 per cent of those who lost jobs re­ported their lay­offs were tem­po­rary, but only 51 per cent thought so last month, ac­cord­ing to the Labour Depart­ment.</p>
    <p>Those re­port­ing per­ma­nent job losses jumped from two mil­lion in April to 3.8 mil­lion last month.</p>
    <p>As the pandemic-sired re­ces­sion per­sists into next year, even lower in­fla­tion, if not de­fla­tion, looms. That would be ac­com­pa­nied by even lower yields on US Trea­sury se­cu­ri­ties.</p>
    <p>Com­mod­ity prices, not just crude oil, would fall. On­line re­tail­ers would con­tinue to ben­e­fit from stay-at-home con­sumers but the pres­sure on shopping malls would in­ten­sify. Many more heav­ily lever­aged re­tail­ers and oth­ers with huge debt ser­vice would fold.</p>
