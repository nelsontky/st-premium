    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong’s aim is to see Sin­ga­pore through the Covid-19 cri­sis and hand the coun­try over “in­tact and in work­ing or­der”, into good hands that can take the coun­try fur­ther for­ward, he said.</p>
    <p>PM Lee, who was yes­ter­day sworn in for his ninth term of of­fice, asked that Sin­ga­pore­ans ex­tend to the younger min­is­ters the same sup­port they have given him over the years.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob, he said: “Madam Pres­i­dent, I have spent my en­tire adult life in pub­lic ser­vice. I will con­tinue to de­vote my­self to my coun­try and peo­ple, draw­ing strength and pur­pose from the sup­port of Sin­ga­pore­ans young and old.”</p>
    <p>In a speech at the swear­ing-in cer­e­mony held at the Is­tana, PM Lee said that lead­er­ship re­newal is a never-end­ing task, and Sin­ga­pore will con­tinue to need more good peo­ple from each gen­er­a­tion to step for­ward, stand for elec­tions and serve the coun­try.</p>
    <p>PM Lee – who was first elected MP in 1984 at the age of 32 – said Sin­ga­pore must have lead­ers who can take the rough and tum­ble of pol­i­tics, and who will com­mit all their en­er­gies to work and fight for what they be­lieve in.</p>
    <p>“Only with an ex­cep­tional lead­er­ship team, work­ing closely with Sin­ga­pore­ans, can we con­tinue to stand out in the world,” he said.</p>
    <p>Good pol­i­tics de­pends not only on sound in­sti­tu­tions, but also on high-qual­ity po­lit­i­cal l ead­er­ship, he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, more than other coun­tries, needs ca­pa­ble and com­mit­ted lead­ers who have “the courage of their con­vic­tions, com­mand the re­spect of Sin­ga­pore­ans and can mo­bilise the pop­u­la­tion to achieve great things to­gether”, he added.</p>
    <p>In the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion, the rul­ing Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party won 83 out of 93 seats con­tested, with 61.23 per cent of the votes.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the polls, PM Lee said, he put to­gether the strong­est Cabi­net he could, to take Sin­ga­pore through the coro­n­avirus cri­sis and be­yond.</p>
    <p>The Cabi­net, he added, is a mul­tira­cial one, with seven out of 20 full min­is­ters be­ing non-Chi­nese, which is re­flec­tive of Sin­ga­pore’s mul­tira­cial so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>He noted that the new Govern­ment was sworn in be­fore Pres­i­dent Hal­imah and Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon, who both be­long to mi­nor­ity com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said: “There can be no more vivid demon­stra­tion of how our mer­i­to­cratic sys­tem works, and the lengths we have gone to, to en­sure equal treat­ment and op­por­tu­ni­ties for ev­ery cit­i­zen, re­gard­less of race, lan­guage or re­li­gion.”</p>
    <p>The Cabi­net also in­cludes of­fice-hold­ers from suc­ces­sive gen­er­a­tions, and the more se­nior ones – hav­ing seen Sin­ga­pore through past crises – can of­fer valu­able guid­ance and views, he added.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said the younger min­is­ters are in­creas­ingly tak­ing the lead, set­ting the agenda and en­gag­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans, and they have also been “lead­ing our Covid-19 re­sponse, and gained con­fi­dence deal­ing with the com­plex chal­lenges of the pan­demic”.</p>
    <p>He said: “The new of­fice-hold­ers will bring with them fresh ideas and perspectiv­es, and work hard to master the is­sues. It is a team that Sin­ga­pore­ans can be con­fi­dent in, and one that will walk with you ev­ery step of the way.”</p>
    <p>In the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion, the rul­ing Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party won 83 out of 93 seats con­tested, with 61.23 per cent of the votes. Af­ter the polls, PM Lee said, he put to­gether the strong­est Cabi­net he could, to take Sin­ga­pore through the coro­n­avirus cri­sis and be­yond.</p>
