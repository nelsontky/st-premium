    <p>WASH­ING­TON • As Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump or­ders US troops out of Ger­many and faces a tough re-elec­tion bat­tle, his top diplo­mat is head­ing to friendly climes in cen­tral and eastern Europe.</p>
    <p>Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo tomorrow opens a five-day trip that will end in close ally Poland, which is ea­ger to wel­come some of the US troops leav­ing Ger­many to guard against his­toric ad­ver­sary Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>He will also travel to the Czech Repub­lic, Slove­nia and Aus­tria, where he is ex­pected to press his cam­paign for na­tions to shun Chi­nese telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions gi­ant Huawei, con­sid­ered a threat by Wash­ing­ton as it takes a lead in the fifth-gen­er­a­tion In­ter­net, or 5G.</p>
    <p>In Slove­nia, where he will be the first US sec­re­tary of state to visit since 2001, Mr Pom­peo will on</p>
    <p>Thursday sign an agree­ment on 5G, of­fi­cials said with­out giv­ing de­tails.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo’s trip comes weeks af­ter the Pen­tagon said the United States would bring home about 6,400 mil­i­tary per­son­nel from Ger­many and shift nearly 5,600 more to other Nato al­lies, in­clud­ing Italy and Bel­gium.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has a tense re­la­tion­ship with Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel – who de­clined his in­vi­ta­tion for a Group of Seven sum­mit in Wash­ing­ton in the mid­dle of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic – and ac­cuses Europe’s largest econ­omy of un­fair trad­ing prac­tices.</p>
    <p>“What is most sig­nif­i­cant about this trip is the places the sec­re­tary is not go­ing to,” said Mr Ian Lesser, the Brus­sels-based vice-pres­i­dent of the Ger­man Marshall Fund of the United States.</p>
    <p>“If the sec­re­tary was go­ing to ad­dress the core is­sues in transat­lantic re­la­tions at the mo­ment, he would be mak­ing stops in Brus­sels, Paris and Ber­lin.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lesser said the troop repo­si­tion­ing out of Ger­many was un­likely to be a big is­sue for US vot­ers.</p>
    <p>“What does have some po­lit­i­cal res­o­nance is how a se­nior Amer­i­can of­fi­cial is re­ceived when he or she goes to Europe,” he said.</p>
    <p>“This is a low-risk visit from the point of view of the ad­min­is­tra­tion... They want to give an im­pres­sion of for­eign pol­icy success.”</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo last month vis­ited Bri­tain and Den­mark and had trav­elled last year to Poland.</p>
    <p>Pol­ish Pres­i­dent An­drzej Duda has formed close ties with his US coun­ter­part. Mr Trump in­vited Mr Duda to the White House days be­fore Poland’s elec­tion in June. Mr Duda won a nar­row vic­tory af­ter a po­lar­is­ing cam­paign in which he at­tacked LGBT (les­bian, gay, bi­sex­ual and trans­gen­der) rights.</p>
    <p>Pol­ish De­fence Min­is­ter Mar­iusz Blaszczak has said that the US will de­ploy at least 1,000 ad­di­tional troops to Poland.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s fair to say Poland is one of our clos­est and strong­est al­lies. We en­joy un­prece­dented lev­els of bi­lat­eral re­la­tions,” Mr Phil Reeker, the top US State Depart­ment of­fi­cial for Europe, told re­porters. He pointed out that Poland is one of the few Nato na­tions to meet a goal of spend­ing 2 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct on de­fence – un­like Ger­many, in a run­ning sore point for the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Reeker said Mr Pom­peo will also raise the mat­ter of en­ergy in­de­pen­dence from Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo last month opened the way for sanc­tions over the Nord Stream 2 pipe­line be­ing built from Rus­sia to Ger­many. Poland adamantly op­poses the pro­ject, fear­ing that it will strengthen Rus­sia’s in­flu­ence over Europe, while an Aus­trian com­pany is among the par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>The tour will be heavy on his­tor­i­cal sym­bol­ism. In the Czech Repub­lic, Mr Pom­peo will head to Pilsen to mark west­ern Bo­hemia’s 1945 lib­er­a­tion by US troops un­der Ge­orge Pat­ton.</p>
    <p>But at least one of Mr Pom­peo’s meet­ings may be tense. Czech Pres­i­dent Mi­los Ze­man is known for his out­spo­ken re­marks, in­clud­ing ones in sup­port of Rus­sia and China.</p>
    <p>Mr Reeker said Mr Pom­peo would have a “short dis­cus­sion” with Mr Ze­man dur­ing what he de­scribed as a cour­tesy call.</p>
    <p>Be­sides what it in­tends to do with its troops in Ger­many, the US also plans to cut its troop lev­els in Afghanista­n to “a num­ber less than 5,000” by the end of Novem­ber, De­fence Sec­re­tary Mark Esper said in an in­ter­view with Fox News last Satur­day, adding de­tail to draw­down plans that Mr Trump had an­nounced ear­lier last week.</p>
    <p>The US has about 8,600 troops in Afghanista­n. Mr Trump said in a re­cent in­ter­view with Ax­ios that the US planned to lower that num­ber to about 4,000.</p>
