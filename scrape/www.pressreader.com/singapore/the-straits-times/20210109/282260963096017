    <p>Amer­i­can elec­tric car maker Tesla has in­di­cated the lo­ca­tion of its first su­per­charger in Sin­ga­pore, and it ap­pears it is at the Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>Is­land Coun­try Club (SICC).</p>
    <p>In its re­cent up­date of its charg­ing net­work world­wide, Tesla showed a black lo­ca­tion ar­row in Sin­ga­pore (black in­di­cates planned charger, while op­er­a­tional charg­ers are marked in red), sit­ting on SICC grounds.</p>
    <p>This reaf­firms the firm’s in­ten­tion to re­turn to Sin­ga­pore – a move first re­ported by The Straits Times in 2016. But since then, there has been lit­tle devel­op­ment, aside from Tesla boss Elon Musk’s occasional tweets about how un­sup­port­ive Sin­ga­pore has been to elec­tric cars, and “un­wel­come” to Tesla, in par­tic­u­lar. It had opened a sales of­fice here in 2010, only to pull the plug less than a year later.</p>
    <p>Things started to move when Tesla posted Sin­ga­pore job open­ings on LinkedIn in mid-2020. In the fourth quar­ter last year, it fol­lowed up with an open­ing for a charg­ing man­ager, in­di­cat­ing it in­tends to set up its own charg­ing net­work here. And in the lat­est charg­ing net­work up­date early this week, it showed a Sin­ga­pore lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Tesla could not be reached for me­dia queries as it no longer has a press depart­ment. Checks re­vealed SICC has not been ap­proached by Tesla for the said charg­ing sta­tion.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to US-based news web­site Elec­trek, not all of Tesla’s planned charg­ing points will ma­te­ri­alise. “Each sta­tion is de­pen­dent on Tesla find­ing a prop­erty to de­ploy the sta­tion, mak­ing an agree­ment with the prop­erty owner, ac­quir­ing the right per­mits, and se­cur­ing” a lo­cal power sup­ply, it says.</p>
    <p>While some ob­servers said the SICC lo­ca­tion made sense be­cause club mem­bers are likely to be able to af­ford Tesla cars which range from around $230,000 to $500,000, oth­ers said Tesla is un­likely to site its first charger some­where in­ac­ces­si­ble to the gen­eral public.</p>
    <p>Tesla owner Adrian Peh said the build­ing of charg­ers here will ben­e­fit po­ten­tial Tesla buy­ers who live in high-rises which do not have charg­ing in­fra­struc­ture. “My condo al­ready has a charger,” said the 48-year-old chief ex­ec­u­tive of a fi­nan­cial ad­vi­sory firm. “Per­son­ally, I am more in­ter­ested in when they will set up a ser­vice cen­tre here.”</p>
    <p>World­wide, Tesla has some 20,000 su­per­charg­ers across more than 4,500 lo­ca­tions. A su­per­charger is a 480-volt di­rect cur­rent fast charger which can power up a car in as quickly as half an hour, com­pared with sev­eral hours for nor­mal charg­ers.</p>
