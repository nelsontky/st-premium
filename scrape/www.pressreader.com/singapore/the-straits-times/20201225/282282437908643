    <p>•</p>
    <p>Hot tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies and other start-ups will soon be per­mit­ted to raise money on the New York Stock Ex­change (NYSE) with­out pay­ing big un­der­writ­ing fees to Wall Street banks, a move that threat­ens to up­end how US ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ings (IPOs) have been con­ducted for decades.</p>
    <p>The United States Se­cu­ri­ties and Ex­change Com­mis­sion (SEC) an­nounced this week that it had ap­proved an NYSE Group plan for so­called pri­mary di­rect list­ings.</p>
    <p>The change marks a ma­jor de­par­ture from tra­di­tional IPOs, in which com­pa­nies rely on in­vest­ment banks to guide their share sales and the stock is al­lo­cated to in­sti­tu­tional in­vestors the night be­fore it starts trad­ing.</p>
    <p>In­stead, com­pa­nies will now be able to sell shares di­rectly on the ex­change to raise cap­i­tal – some­thing pre­vi­ously not al­lowed.</p>
    <p>Di­rect-list­ing IPOs have been lim­ited to date, as they have mostly been used by busi­nesses that wanted to cre­ate liq­uid­ity events for early in­vestors or man­age­ment to cash out by sell­ing stock, as op­posed to is­su­ing new shares that at­tract bil­lions in fresh money.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, work­place man­age­ment soft­ware maker Asana and data-min­ing com­pany Palan­tir Tech­nolo­gies, which was founded by bil­lion­aire Peter Thiel, used di­rect list­ings to go pub­lic.</p>
    <p>The SEC sign-off of the NYSE’s plan fol­lows months of wran­gling, in­clud­ing a de­ci­sion made ear­lier this year to halt con­sid­er­a­tion of the pro­posal at the re­quest of the Coun­cil of In­sti­tu­tional In­vestors, a group that rep­re­sents ma­jor pen­sion funds and en­dow­ments.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil had ar­gued that the plan eroded in­vestor pro­tec­tions and might make it more dif­fi­cult for share­hold­ers to sue over ma­te­rial mis­state­ments or omis­sions made dur­ing the IPO process.</p>
    <p>NYSE re­jected those crit­i­cisms and dis­puted that the changes will in­crease risks to in­vestors – ar­gu­ments that ul­ti­mately won out.</p>
    <p>Get­ting the rule done un­der SEC chair­man Jay Clayton, who was ap­pointed by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, might prove im­por­tant for the ex­change and Sil­i­con Val­ley. That is be­cause there is no guar­an­tee that an SEC chief picked by Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den would ap­prove the NYSE’s pro­posal.</p>
    <p>LIST­ING SURGE?</p>
    <p>Now that the SEC is al­low­ing com­pa­nies to raise fresh cap­i­tal through di­rect list­ings, both crit­ics and back­ers agree that they could be­come much more pop­u­lar.</p>
    <p>“This is a game changer for our cap­i­tal mar­kets, lev­el­ling the play­ing field for ev­ery­day in­vestors and pro­vid­ing com­pa­nies with another path to go pub­lic at a moment when they are seek­ing just this type of in­no­va­tion,” NYSE pres­i­dent Stacey Cun­ning­ham said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>One rea­son why start-ups and their ven­ture cap­i­tal back­ers might favour di­rect list­ings is that there could be less of a gap be­tween the of­fer­ing price set by bankers and the pop that of­ten en­sues on the first day of trad­ing.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Airbnb opened at US$146 a share dur­ing its IPO ear­lier this month, a much higher val­u­a­tion than its US$68 list­ing price. That ar­guably cost the com­pany and its early back­ers US$4 bil­lion (S$5.3 bil­lion), with pro­fes­sional in­vestors who were al­lo­cated shares reap­ing the ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>“This is huge and will hope­fully end 40 years of mis­priced IPOs through an old an­ti­quated process,” ven­ture cap­i­tal­ist Bill Gur­ley of Bench­mark wrote on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>“It’s very ex­cit­ing to see the SEC en­able in­no­va­tion in this way.”</p>
    <p>Even if banks do not un­der­write di­rect list­ings, they would still be ex­pected to make fees from ad­vis­ing com­pa­nies that go pub­lic. As an ex­am­ple, Palan­tir paid out tens of mil­lions in con­sult­ing fees as part of its of­fer­ing, ac­cord­ing to a reg­u­la­tory fil­ing.</p>
    <p>Un­der NYSE’s plan, when stock changes hands once trad­ing com­mences, new shares will have pri­or­ity over se­condary ones.</p>
    <p>This will give com­pa­nies a bet­ter chance at reach­ing their fund-rais­ing goals.</p>
    <p>Ven­ture cap­i­tal­ists have long ad­vo­cated greater use of di­rect list­ings, in part be­cause the ar­range­ments do not re­quire in­vestors to wait for lock-up pe­ri­ods to ex­pire be­fore they can sell their shares.</p>
    <p>Some ad­vis­ers to com­pa­nies are scep­ti­cal that the change will de­ter busi­nesses from pur­su­ing tra­di­tional IPOs.</p>
    <p>Ms Lise Buyer, a manag­ing part­ner at Class V Group, said there are bet­ter ways than a di­rect list­ing to min­imise big gains on the first day of trad­ing, if that is a com­pany’s in­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>“It’s a con­struct that doesn’t solve any prob­lem for any­one,” said Ms Buyer, whose firm helps start-ups pre­pare for pub­lic list­ings.</p>
