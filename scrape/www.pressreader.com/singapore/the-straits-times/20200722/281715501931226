    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily coro­n­avirus pa­tients in the com­mu­nity has been steadily fall­ing, with yes­ter­day be­ing the eighth day in a row that the fig­ure has de­creased.</p>
    <p>Last night, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said that the fig­ure in the past week has dropped to 10 cases, from 13 cases two weeks ago.</p>
    <p>Since the lift­ing of the cir­cuit breaker on June 2, the num­ber of Covid-19 com­mu­nity cases has been grad­u­ally ris­ing. But the av­er­age num­ber of new daily com­mu­nity cases in a week be­gan fall­ing from July 14.</p>
    <p>MOH also said yes­ter­day that the num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity fell from a daily av­er­age of seven two weeks ago to six in the past week.</p>
    <p>There were 399 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Singapore’s to­tal to 48,434.</p>
    <p>The new cases in­clude nine com­mu­nity cases, com­pris­ing a Sin­ga­porean, three work pass hold­ers and five work per­mit hold­ers, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>There were also three im­ported cases – two work pass hold­ers and one spe­cial pass holder.</p>
    <p>The work pass hold­ers were two In­dian na­tion­als aged 29 and 34.</p>
    <p>The two men ar­rived in Singapore on July 9 from In­dia. Both were asymp­to­matic and tested pos­i­tive while serv­ing their stay-home no­tice.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing im­ported case, a 22-year-old spe­cial pass holder, ar­rived here on Sun­day from the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>MOH said he was taken di­rectly to the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Diseases as he had symp­toms.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 387 Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>The higher num­ber of cases was mainly due to a batch of test re­sults from Mon­day be­ing re­ported to MOH af­ter the noon cut-off for Mon­day’s re­port­ing.</p>
    <p>MOH added t hat t he I nterA­gency Task Force has been sys­tem­at­i­cally and pro­gres­sively clear­ing dor­mi­to­ries through the ag­gres­sive test­ing of mi­grant work­ers re­sid­ing there.</p>
    <p>The Wood­lands Lodge II dor­mi­tory at 190 Wood­lands In­dus­trial Park E7 and the SSKBJV Dor­mi­tory at 31A Tanah Merah Coast Road have been cleared, and now house only re­cov­ered in­di­vid­u­als and those who have re­cently tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 in­fec­tion. Thus, the clus­ters have now been closed.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a FairPrice out­let at 2 Joo Chiat Road was added to the list of places that were visited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>MOH pro­vides the list to get people who were at these places at spe­cific pe­ri­ods to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
