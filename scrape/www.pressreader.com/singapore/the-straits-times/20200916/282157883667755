    <p>A pro­gramme to help law prac­tices adopt tech­nol­ogy has been ex­tended to Jan­uary next year.</p>
    <p>The grant sup­port for the Techcel­er­ate for Law pro­gramme cov­er­ing the first-year cost of adopt­ing base­line and ad­vanced tech­nol­ogy so­lu­tions has also been in­creased to 80 per cent, up from 70 per cent.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme, which was an­nounced in May last year, was due to stop re­ceiv­ing ap­pli­ca­tions on May 1 this year.</p>
    <p>The ex­ten­sion to the pro­gramme was made in April this year.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing about the ex­ten­sion yes­ter­day, Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Law Ed­win Tong said law prac­tices here need to use tech­nol­ogy to im­prove their ser­vices to stay com­pet­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Un­der this “new nor­mal”, prac­tices that are able to quickly adapt and cap­i­talise on tech­nol­ogy to en­hance the ac­ces­si­bil­ity, qual­ity, value and de­liv­ery of their ser­vices will gar­ner a last­ing ad­van­tage, said Mr Tong in a key­note ad­dress at the RHT Caba Asean Sum­mit, which is be­ing held online.</p>
    <p>The two-day sum­mit, which ends to­day, is or­gan­ised by re­gional law firm RHTLaw Asia and the China-Asean Busi­ness Al­liance (Caba).</p>
    <p>Mr Tong, who is also Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth, said that Sin­ga­pore’s le­gal regime has helped the coun­try weather the im­pact of Covid-19 and re­main a trusted place for busi­ness.</p>
    <p>He cited South Korean car­maker Hyundai Mo­tors and In­dian IT firm Tata Consultanc­y Ser­vices as ex­am­ples of com­pa­nies that have in­vested in Sin­ga­pore this year amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Our le­gal regime has been a key pil­lar of sup­port dur­ing this pe­riod and it must re­main so,” he said.</p>
    <p>To help the le­gal com­mu­nity fur­ther, a pro­gramme called the Tech­nol­ogy and In­no­va­tion Roadmap will be launched next month to help law prac­tices bet­ter un­der­stand the le­gal tech­nol­ogy land­scape and frame­work.</p>
    <p>Firms can use the road map, first re­ported last year, to work out how to up­grade their tech­nol­ogy ser­vices and to iden­tify ex­ist­ing and new gov­ern­ment ini­tia­tives such as grants to tap, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong said im­prove­ments had also been made to me­di­a­tion ser­vices and the re­struc­tur­ing and in­sol­vency frame­work in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He ex­pects the Sin­ga­pore Con­ven­tion on Me­di­a­tion, which kicked in last Satur­day, to at­tract more coun­tries, given that me­di­a­tion saves time and cost, and pre­serves busi­ness re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, the con­ven­tion has 53 sig­na­to­ries.</p>
    <p>An­other ex­am­ple is the In­sol­vency, Re­struc­tur­ing and Dis­so­lu­tion Act, which started on July 30.</p>
    <p>“We con­stantly re­view our frame­works in var­i­ous ar­eas be­cause a pro­gres­sive le­gal regime is vi­tal to meet the fast-chang­ing de­mands of the com­mer­cial world,” Mr Tong said.</p>
    <p>“Such trust in Sin­ga­pore as a busi­ness and fi­nan­cial hub is built largely on confidence in our ro­bust le­gal sys­tem and strong ad­her­ence to the rule of law, but we can­not take it for granted,” he added.</p>
    <p>“If any in­vest­ment dis­putes do arise, busi­nesses are as­sured that they can be re­solved quickly, fairly, cost-ef­fec­tively and, most im­por­tantly, trans­par­ently.”</p>
