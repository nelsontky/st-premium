    <p>• Ice­land will for­ever bear a scar for English foot­ball, af­ter an em­bar­rass­ing exit at Euro 2016 to a coun­try with a pop­u­la­tion of less than 1 per cent the pool on of­fer to the Three Lions.</p>
    <p>Four years on, the na­tions meet to­day in the Na­tions League for the first time since that fate­ful night in Nice, with the vis­i­tors in Reyk­javik a much-changed side.</p>
    <p>Only six of the Eng­land squad who lost in the round of 16 in that tour­na­ment re­main.</p>
    <p>Among t hem, cap­tain Harry Kane, 27, and Ra­heem Ster­ling, 25, are now the se­nior fig­ures in a squad filled with youth, flair and far less fear than the side who were racked by self-doubt af­ter fall­ing 2-1 be­hind just 18 min­utes into that fa­mous de­feat by Ice­land.</p>
    <p>Phil Foden, 20, and Ma­son Green­wood, 18, have been handed their first se­nior call-ups af­ter im­press­ing for Manch­ester City and Manch­ester United re­spec­tively since foot­ball re­turned from the coro­n­avirus shut­down in June.</p>
    <p>They could be two of the ben­e­fi­cia­ries of the one-year de­lay to the Euro­pean Cham­pi­onship, with Eng­land one of the favourites for a tour­na­ment they will largely play on home soil next summer.</p>
    <p>“They are re­al­is­tic chal­lengers,” said Eng­land boss Gareth South­gate about Foden and Green­wood’s prospects for Euro 2020.</p>
    <p>Both will have to fight their way into one of the most star-stud­ded front lines in world foot­ball, one which al­ready boasts Kane, Ster­ling, Green­wood’s United team­mate Mar­cus Rash­ford and Jadon San­cho of Borus­sia Dort­mund.</p>
    <p>South­gate added: “We’re a year away from a Euro­pean Cham­pi­onship, let’s see if they can break into that team. It gives us great com­pe­ti­tion for places.”</p>
    <p>Nei­ther player seems to lack con­fi­dence when it comes to mak­ing an im­pact on in­ter­na­tional foot­ball.</p>
    <p>Green­wood has been hailed by for­mer Eng­land greats Alan Shearer and Wayne Rooney for his abil­ity to fin­ish clin­i­cally with either foot. He scored 19 goals in his break­through sea­son.</p>
    <p>Foden also has lofty am­bi­tions as he hopes to be the man to fill David Silva’s shoes at City next sea­son.</p>
    <p>Named player of the tour­na­ment when Eng­land won the Un­der-17 World Cup three years ago, he has al­ready ex­pe­ri­enced suc­cess at in­ter­na­tional level.</p>
    <p>He and Eng­land’s new gen­er­a­tion still have to prove them­selves at se­nior level, but they are pro­vid­ing far more cause for op­ti­mism than the crop that will for­ever be re­mem­bered for crum­bling to Ice­land.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Spain cap­tain Ser­gio Ramos has praised his side for not giv­ing up the fight, as Jose Luis Gaya snatched a late point in their 1-1 Na­tions League draw with Ger­many in Stuttgart on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The Ger­mans were seconds away from vic­tory i n the League A, Group 4 clash af­ter Chelsea’s new sign­ing Timo Werner gave the hosts a se­cond-half lead, only for Gaya to tap home a Ro­drigo Moreno header in the sixth minute of added time.</p>
    <p>“We fought un­til the end. It was a good test for the start of the sea­son,” said Ramos to Ger­man broad­caster ZDF.</p>
