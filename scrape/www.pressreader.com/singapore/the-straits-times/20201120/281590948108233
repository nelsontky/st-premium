    <p>THINK LONG TERM</p>
    <p>The world will take sev­eral years to re­cover from the Covid-19 pandemic and even then, some things will change in the new nor­mal, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said yesterday.</p>
    <p>He does not see Sin­ga­pore, in the short term, es­cap­ing overnight from the pre­cau­tions and risks that ex­ist right now. “It is not pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>Even if there is a vac­cine by the be­gin­ning of next year, it will prob­a­bly be 2022 by the time it gets rolled out to a sig­nif­i­cant pro­por­tion of the pop­u­la­tion and have an im­pact on slow­ing down the spread of the dis­ease, he added during a virtual event associated with the Asia-Pa­cific Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion (Apec) group­ing.</p>
    <p>PM Lee also does not fore­see in­ter­na­tional travel re­turn­ing to nor­mal next year: “Maybe i n two years’ time, it would be pos­si­ble to ex­tend in a big­ger way. But that is down the road.”</p>
    <p>He said there will be last­ing im­pacts, even af­ter Covid-19 is gone, as peo­ple would have be­come used to work­ing re­motely, do­ing busi­ness on­line and trav­el­ling less.</p>
    <p>PM Lee gave this sober­ing pic­ture at the Apec CEO Di­a­logues for po­lit­i­cal and busi­ness lead­ers in the Apec Busi­ness Ad­vi­sory Coun­cil, which meets four times a year to ad­vise lead­ers in the re­gion on the pri­or­i­ties and concerns of com­pa­nies in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Other speak­ers at the an­nual event, which is or­gan­ised by Malaysia this year and ends to­day, in­clude Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, New Zealand Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern and Face­book chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer Sh­eryl Sand­berg.</p>
    <p>When asked by mod­er­a­tor and Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion (SBF) chief ex­ec­u­tive Ho Meng Kit what ad­vice he has for busi­ness lead­ers fac­ing an un­cer­tain fu­ture, PM Lee said: “I am not a busi­ness­man, I hes­i­tate to preach, but in this sit­u­a­tion, you have to look for­ward – not back to what (it) was... Make an ob­jec­tive as­sess­ment of what it means for your busi­ness and how you can best ad­vance it.”</p>
    <p>He added that whether these busi­nesses choose to pivot, trans­form or right-size, it is im­por­tant that they take good care of their workers, who are also stake­hold­ers and an im­por­tant re­source.</p>
    <p>“Look af­ter them during this dif­fi­cult pe­riod. Do not just make a short, quick de­ci­sion – ‘I am sav­ing cost and I must drop so many head­counts’ – but take care of them, re­train them if pos­si­ble, re­de­ploy them if pos­si­ble, and they (will) re­pay that to you and to your company.</p>
    <p>“In the process, we will strengthen our co­he­sion and one day, we will pros­per again.”</p>
    <p>He noted that the Gov­ern­ment had stepped up in a ma­jor way to pre­serve jobs and make sure busi­nesses sur­vive as far as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>It has un­leashed un­prece­dented fis­cal fire­power this year to the tune of around $100 bil­lion in Covid-19 sup­port mea­sures, and is looking to draw up to $52 bil­lion from past re­serves.</p>
    <p>Point­ing to those hit hard­est, PM</p>
    <p>Lee said that many are self-em­ployed, such as tour guides and free­lance coaches.</p>
    <p>“They all des­per­ately needed help. The first thing to do was to keep body and soul to­gether... I think it has pre­vented a lot of hard­ship and kept the econ­omy at least nose above wa­ter, afloat.”</p>
    <p>But now that the sit­u­a­tion is sta­bil­is­ing, “this large in­fu­sion of gov­ern­ment re­sources can­not go on in­def­i­nitely, and we have to grad­u­ally tail this off and get things onto a sus­tain­able foot­ing”, he said.</p>
    <p>“We have to adapt our­selves for what is to come, rather than freeze a po­si­tion which re­flected what was pre-Covid-19. Oth­er­wise, we will end up with zom­bie com­pa­nies and an un­pro­duc­tive econ­omy, and I think that will lead to more trou­ble for us later on.”</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edg­ing that en­ter­tain­ment and tourism busi­nesses are not out of the woods yet, un­like the man­u­fac­tur­ing and tech­nol­ogy sec­tors which are do­ing well, he said the au­thor­i­ties are ex­per­i­ment­ing with how en­ter­tain­ment out­lets can be opened up safely.</p>
    <p>“But it is very chal­leng­ing be­cause the whole point of en­ter­tain­ment is that you go to let your hair down, whereas here, we are try­ing to keep our guard up.</p>
    <p>“Even if you have rules, when you want to re­lax and have a drink and then sing some songs, or dance in an en­ter­tain­ment lounge, karaoke, it is a com­pletely dif­fer­ent mind­set al­to­gether.”</p>
    <p>Un­der a pi­lot pro­gramme, se­lected nightlife venues can re­open by next month or Jan­uary un­der strict safe man­age­ment mea­sures, such as wear­ing masks on the dance floor and show­ing proof of neg­a­tive Covid-19 tests be­fore be­ing al­lowed in.</p>
    <p>In his re­marks fol­low­ing the Di­a­logues, SBF’s Mr Ho said the re­sump­tion of safe and seam­less travel is cru­cial to gen­er­ate mar­ket de­mand and re­vive busi­ness and other ac­tiv­i­ties that will en­able the global econ­omy to re­cover.</p>
    <p>“The Apec Sum­mit is hope­fully an op­por­tu­nity for lead­ers to progress work on a pos­si­ble re­gional travel bub­ble to fa­cil­i­tate move­ment of peo­ple across bor­ders.”</p>
    <p>Look af­ter them during this dif­fi­cult pe­riod. Do not just make a short, quick de­ci­sion – ‘I am sav­ing cost and I must drop so many head­counts’ – but take care of them, re­train them if pos­si­ble, re­de­ploy them if pos­si­ble, and they</p>
    <p>(will) re­pay that to you and to your company.</p>
