    <p>Gulf states yes­ter­day signed a rap­proche­ment deal at a sum­mit in the Saudi city of Al-Ula, wel­com­ing Qatar back into the re­gional fold af­ter a three-year rift that has frac­tured the Arab world. The “sol­i­dar­ity and sta­bil­ity” agree­ment comes af­ter Riyadh re­opened its land, sea and air borders to Doha late on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>AL-ULA (Saudi Ara­bia) • Gulf lead­ers signed a “sol­i­dar­ity and sta­bil­ity” deal yes­ter­day af­ter the lead­ers of Saudi Ara­bia and Qatar pub­licly em­braced, bring­ing Doha back into the re­gional fold af­ter a three-year rift that has frac­tured the Arab world.</p>
    <p>Saudi Ara­bia led a coali­tion of coun­tries in the Gulf and beyond to cut ties and trans­port links with Qatar in June 2017, charg­ing that it was too close to Iran and backed rad­i­cal Is­lamist groups – al­le­ga­tions Doha de­nied.</p>
    <p>Those coun­tries, along with Oman and Kuwait that have me­di­ated be­tween the two sides, signed a rap­proche­ment deal in the Saudi city of Al-Ula, af­ter Riyadh overnight re­opened its land, sea and air borders to Doha.</p>
    <p>“There is a des­per­ate need to­day to unite our ef­forts to pro­mote our re­gion and to con­front chal­lenges that sur­round us, es­pe­cially the threats posed by the Ira­nian regime’s nu­clear and bal­lis­tic mis­sile pro­gramme and its plans for sab­o­tage and de­struc­tion,” said Saudi Crown Prince Mo­hammed bin Sal­man.</p>
    <p>De­tails of the agree­ment were not im­me­di­ately re­leased and an­a­lysts have warned that any deal could be pre­lim­i­nary and may not im­me­di­ately end all mea­sures taken against Qatar.</p>
    <p>But the warm wel­come that Prince Mo­hammed ex­tended to Qatar’s ruler Sheikh Tamim bin Ha­mad Al-Thani, with the pair em­brac­ing at the air­port and then chat­ting an­i­mat­edly, in­di­cates a sig­nif­i­cant break­through.</p>
    <p>“These are first steps... Some may be­lit­tle that progress, but re­sum­ing open di­rect com­mu­ni­ca­tion and avoid­ing ver­bal at­tacks is progress,” said Kuwait Univer­sity as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor Bader al-Saif.</p>
    <p>“The other states... will fol­low suit and pur­sue sim­i­lar rec­on­cil­ia­tory steps.”</p>
    <p>Washington has in­ten­si­fied pres­sure for a res­o­lu­tion to what Doha calls a “block­ade”, in­sist­ing Gulf unity is nec­es­sary to iso­late US foe Iran as the cur­tain falls on Mr Don­ald Trump’s pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>Mr Jared Kush­ner, Mr Trump’s se­nior ad­viser who shut­tled around the re­gion to seek a deal, at­tended the sign­ing in Al-Ula.</p>
    <p>“The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion will claim this as an­other vic­tory for sure,” said Royal United Ser­vices In­sti­tute an­a­lyst To­bias Borck, stress­ing that the boy­cott coun­tries had not yet nor­malised re­la­tions with Qatar.</p>
    <p>Kuwaiti For­eign Min­is­ter Ah­mad Nasser Al-Sabah an­nounced on state tele­vi­sion late on Mon­day that “it was agreed to open the airspace and land and sea borders be­tween the King­dom of Saudi Ara­bia and the State of Qatar, start­ing from this evening”.</p>
    <p>Driv­ers south of Doha on the Salwa high­way to­wards the Saudi bor­der at Abu Samra sounded their horns and waved their arms from their car win­dows in the wake of the an­nounce­ment.</p>
    <p>“We will see all Saudis here, also all Qataris will visit Saudi Ara­bia, and we will be friends as we were be­fore and bet­ter,” said Mr Hisham al-Hashmi, a Qatari with an Emi­rati mother.</p>
    <p>Saudi media, which is in­flu­en­tial through­out the re­gion, quickly adopted a tone in stark con­trast to past cov­er­age of Qatar that had fo­cused on pre­vi­ous trans­gres­sions and al­leged crimes, in­stead talk­ing about “unity” and “fra­ter­nity”.</p>
    <p>The Saudi-led Gulf Co­op­er­a­tion Coun­cil hawks, along with Egypt, in 2017 closed their airspace to Qatari planes, sealed their borders and ports, and ex­pelled Qatari cit­i­zens. An in­for­ma­tion bat­tle raged on­line with the two camps trad­ing barbs, deep­en­ing the re­sent­ments.</p>
    <p>The United Arab Emirates and Qatar in par­tic­u­lar re­main di­vided over Doha’s per­ceived sup­port for move­ments aligned to the Mus­lim Broth­er­hood and the two coun­tries’ back­ing for ri­val groups in the Libya con­flict.</p>
    <p>But the diplo­matic freeze served only to make Qatar more self-suf­fi­cient and push it closer to Iran, ob­servers say. It has also hurt Saudi strate­gic in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>At the start of the cri­sis, the boy­cotting coun­tries is­sued a list of 13 de­mands to Doha, in­clud­ing the clo­sure of pan-Arab satel­lite tele­vi­sion chan­nel Al Jazeera and the shut­ter­ing of a Turk­ish mil­i­tary base in Qatar. Qatar has not pub­licly bowed to any of the de­mands.</p>
    <p>’With most of the coun­try al­ready un­der ex­treme mea­sures, it’s clear that we need to do more to­gether to bring this new vari­ant un­der con­trol.</p>
