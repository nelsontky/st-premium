    <p>NEW YORK • As cases of coro­n­avirus tick up again in New York, par­tic­u­larly in neigh­bour­hoods with sig­nif­i­cant pop­u­la­tions of Ortho­dox Jews, some res­i­dents say they feel at­tacked or in­sulted, ac­cus­ing the au­thor­i­ties of cre­at­ing a stigma based on their faith.</p>
    <p>For two weeks, the pos­i­tiv­ity rate – the pro­por­tion of pos­i­tive re­sults out of the to­tal num­ber of tests per­formed – has been ris­ing in Amer­ica’s most pop­u­lous city.</p>
    <p>Af­ter long hov­er­ing around 1 per cent, the key pos­i­tiv­ity in­di­ca­tor on Tues­day ex­ceeded 3 per cent, what New York Mayor Bill de Bla­sio called “cause for real con­cern”.</p>
    <p>The most sig­nif­i­cant jumps in­volve neigh­bour­hoods of Brook­lyn, where Ortho­dox Jewish pop­u­la­tions are sub­stan­tial, and co­in­cided with gath­er­ings linked to the re­cent Jewish hol­i­days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kip­pur.</p>
    <p>The mayor said the city was send­ing the po­lice and health work­ers to im­pacted neigh­bour­hoods to pro­mote so­cial dis­tanc­ing and mask-wear­ing – and to is­sue sum­mons if nec­es­sary to any­one re­fus­ing to com­ply. “This is an inflection point,” Mr de Bla­sio said. “We have to take more ac­tion at this point.”</p>
    <p>City Hall is aim­ing not to sin­gle out New York’s di­verse Jewish com­mu­ni­ties by name, but ten­sions are pal­pa­ble.</p>
    <p>“Brook­lyn is not a Jewish com­mu­nity, we are part of the com­mu­nity,” Mr Steve Zuker, 52, said in front of the Lan­daus Shul, a syn­a­gogue in the Mid­wood neigh­bour­hood where the pos­i­tiv­ity rate is near 6 per cent. “We feel at­tacked, and when you are at­tacked on your be­liefs, peo­ple at­tack back.”</p>
    <p>Mr de Bla­sio also trig­gered fury af­ter threat­en­ing “the Jewish com­mu­nity” on Twit­ter in April with sum­mons and ar­rest af­ter a large crowd of Ha­sidic Jews gath­ered for a rabbi’s funeral in Brook­lyn.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Mr Zuker, his com­mu­nity lead­ers are pro­mot­ing aware­ness of Covid-19 risks, while also dis­tribut­ing masks and adding tem­po­rary spa­ces to al­low for so­cial dis­tanc­ing of wor­ship­pers.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, New York City restau­rants re­opened in­door din­ing at 25 per cent ca­pac­ity on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>At Il Gat­topardo, an up­scale south­ern Ital­ian restau­rant in Man­hat­tan, owner Gian­franco Sor­rentino said ex­treme health pre­cau­tions were es­sen­tial to pull his eatery through one of his tough­est times in the busi­ness in 30 years.</p>
    <p>“We change masks and every­body has to wash their hands ev­ery 15, 20 min­utes,” Mr Sor­rentino said of his wait­ers. Cus­tomers smiled across ta­bles that had been unoccupied since a lock­down was or­dered in March in New York, once the US epi­cen­tre of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Diner Reid Rosen said: “It’s fan­tas­tic to be with peo­ple, to ac­tu­ally have an en­joy­able meal with friends and fam­ily and ac­quain­tances and fel­low work­ers.”</p>
