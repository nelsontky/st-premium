    <p>Gareth Bale’s move back to Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur from Real Madrid will be com­pleted this week, the player’s agent Jonathan Bar­nett told AFP yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal de­tails of a com­pli­cated deal are now be­ing fi­nalised by Madrid and Spurs, with Bale ex­pected to seal a re­turn to the club he left for a world-record €100 mil­lion (S$160.5 mil­lion) in 2013.</p>
    <p>“We’re get­ting there,” Bar­nett told AFP. “I think it will be com­pleted this week.”</p>
    <p>Madrid have been push­ing for a per­ma­nent trans­fer for Bale in the hope of be­ing rid of his salary, worth around €30 mil­lion a year.</p>
    <p>But Tot­ten­ham are ex­pected ini­tially to take him on loan as part of a pack­age that in­cludes them pay­ing around half of his wages, as well as some added fees de­pend­ing on the Welsh­man’s per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>That would mean the to­tal deal could cost Spurs around €20 mil­lion for the sea­son.</p>
    <p>Bale has scored 105 goals and made 68 as­sists in 251 games for Real Madrid while win­ning four Cham­pi­ons League ti­tles and two in La Liga.</p>
    <p>But de­spite some daz­zling mo­ments, his early years in Spain were dis­rupted by in­juries while his role has been sig­nif­i­cantly re­duced in re­cent sea­sons un­der Zine­dine Zi­dane.</p>
    <p>Com­mon themes among Bale’s crit­ics are that he did not show the same com­mit­ment to the club as for Wales, and that he did not as­pire to be the team’s leader af­ter Cris­tiano Ron­aldo left in 2018.</p>
    <p>A nat­u­rally shy char­ac­ter who rarely gave in­ter­views or spoke Span­ish in pub­lic, he never in­gra­ti­ated him­self to Madrid sup­port­ers, who have idolised larger-than-life fig­ures such as the late Juanito and cur­rent cap­tain Ser­gio Ramos.</p>
    <p>In a some­what ab­surd in­ter­pre­ta­tion of the facts, Bale’s fond­ness for play­ing golf in his spare time was taken as a sign he was not 100 per cent com­mit­ted to play­ing foot­ball, while he was also of­ten blamed for his fre­quent in­juries.</p>
    <p>He did not al­ways help him­self though, from danc­ing with a fan’s ban­ner which cel­e­brated his love for Wales and golf over Madrid last year, to look­ing bored and lethar­gic as he sat on the sub­sti­tutes’ bench for the fi­nal matches of last sea­son.</p>
    <p>The 31-year-old will join Jose Mour­inho at Spurs, who re­it­er­ated on Wed­nes­day that he tried to sign the for­ward while he was in charge of Real Madrid.</p>
    <p>“I tried to sign him dur­ing my time at Real Madrid and the pres­i­dent fol­lowed my in­stinct and knowledge and the sea­son I left, he brought Gareth to the club,” Mour­inho said. “That’s no se­cret and Gareth knows that.”</p>
    <p>Tot­ten­ham are also close to com­plet­ing the sign­ing of Real left-back Ser­gio Reguilon for around €30 mil­lion. He en­joyed an ex­cel­lent 2018-19 sea­son for Madrid but Zi­dane sent the 23-year-old on loan last year to Sevilla, where he helped them fin­ish fourth in La Liga and win the Europa League.</p>
