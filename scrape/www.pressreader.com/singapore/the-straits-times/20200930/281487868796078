    <p>Mem­bers of the public will be able to go be­hind the scenes at Sin­ga­pore Air­lines’ (SIA) train­ing cen­tre, have a meal on a grounded Air­bus A-380 plane or recre­ate the ex­pe­ri­ence of din­ing on board in the com­fort of their homes.</p>
    <p>Th­ese new ini­tia­tives were an­nounced by SIA yesterday, as the car­rier seeks new ways to en­gage cus­tomers. It also said it will not be launch­ing flights to nowhere.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times had re­ported on Sept 11 that SIA was look­ing into launch­ing such flights that would de­part and land at Changi Air­port.</p>
    <p>But the idea was crit­i­cised by en­vi­ron­men­tal­ists who said it would cause un­nec­es­sary pol­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>A move­ment to sug­gest al­ter­na­tives quickly gained trac­tion, with more than 2,000 ideas col­lated and sub­mit­ted to SIA ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>SIA said it de­cided on its new of­fer­ings based on a mar­ket study and comprehens­ive re­view. “(SIA) con­sid­ered fac­tors such as the at­trac­tive­ness of the ini­tia­tives to SIA’s cus­tomers and mem­bers of the public, the en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pli­ca­tions, and their fi­nan­cial vi­a­bil­ity,” it said.</p>
    <p>“An idea for a one-off short tour flight, or a ‘flight to nowhere’, was also ini­tially con­sid­ered but not pur­sued after the re­view.”</p>
    <p>Its chief ex­ec­u­tive Goh Choon Phong said the ini­tia­tives will let SIA en­gage cus­tomers even as most flights re­main grounded.</p>
    <p>He also thanked those who gave feed­back to SIA about its cus­tomer en­gage­ment ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>“We are very en­cour­aged by and grate­ful for the en­thu­si­asm and pas­sion that we have seen,” he said.</p>
    <p>Se­nior lec­turer Boey Yew Tung of Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s Nanyang Busi­ness School said the new ini­tia­tives will bol­ster SIA’s stand­ing. “Re­in­forc­ing brand aware­ness and re­call are im­por­tant tac­tics for com­pa­nies, es­pe­cially when they can­not ac­tively present them­selves to the public when their reg­u­lar mode of op­er­a­tions is se­verely cur­tailed,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that the train­ing cen­tre tours will likely be es­pe­cially pop­u­lar, based on ob­ser­va­tions from air shows and other open-house tours.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Nitin Pan­garkar from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness School said none of the ini­tia­tives will sig­nif­i­cantly off­set SIA’s losses.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Ms Chevon Low, 30, a mem­ber of en­vi­ron­men­tal non­profit or­gan­i­sa­tion PM Haze, said she was very happy to hear of SIA’s de­ci­sion not to launch flights to nowhere. She and three oth­ers had can­vassed sug­ges­tions, many of which were sim­i­lar to the ones SIA is now launch­ing.</p>
    <p>She added: “SIA did make sus­tain­abil­ity goals be­fore the flights-tonowhere pro­posal, so it’s great to see they are com­mit­ting to them.</p>
    <p>“I would love to go for any of the ex­pe­ri­ences of­fered and we are sure they’ll be very well re­ceived.”</p>
    <p>Avi­a­tion en­thu­si­ast and en­gi­neer Gavin Ang, 25, wel­comed SIA’s de­ci­sion to open its train­ing cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“We should do more to stop pol­lu­tion – but there is much more we can do than stop a few flights to nowhere. I thought such flights were a great op­por­tu­nity to fly the air­craft, to gen­er­ate in­come and min­imise job losses,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity trans­port an­a­lyst Ter­ence Fan said flights to nowhere would have given pi­lots much needed prac­tice in han­dling planes.</p>
    <p>But he wel­comed SIA’s new ini­tia­tives, even as he noted that they could have been in­tro­duced a few months ear­lier to try to mit­i­gate the im­pact of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He added that SIA could do more in in­cen­tivis­ing cus­tomers to book tick­ets by of­fer­ing dis­counts for fu­ture trips. “I think if peo­ple are will­ing to book ahead, they ought to be re­warded a bit more.”</p>
