    <p>A ven­ti­la­tion duct col­lapsed from the ceil­ing of a cinema hall at Nex shop­ping mall yes­ter­day dur­ing a movie, in­jur­ing two peo­ple.</p>
    <p>A Shaw The­atres spokesman said the duct in Hall 6 was dis­lodged at around 4.45pm. Cinema staff tended to the in­jured cus­tomers un­til paramedics ar­rived, he said.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force said two in­jured peo­ple were taken to Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal. De­tails of their in­juries were not im­me­di­ately avail­able.</p>
    <p>The cinema, lo­cated at the fourth level of Nex, will be closed un­til fur­ther no­tice, said the Shaw The­atres spokesman, who added that the com­pany is work­ing with land­lord Gold Ridge and the au­thor­i­ties to in­ves­ti­gate the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that all the 10 cinema halls were evac­u­ated, and staff asked cus­tomers for their names and con­tact de­tails to re­fund their tick­ets.</p>
    <p>A photo on web­site Must­share­news showed that the dis­lodged ven­ti­la­tion duct landed across sev­eral rows of seats on the right side of the theatre. In one photo, a cus­tomer was seen ly­ing on the floor, while an­other showed a per­son strapped to a stretcher.</p>
    <p>A Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Author­ity (BCA) spokesman said it sent an en­gi­neer to in­ves­ti­gate the fallen air-con­di­tion­ing and me­chan­i­cal ven­ti­la­tion duct at 5.30pm.</p>
    <p>BCA has in­structed the build­ing owner to ap­point a pro­fes­sional en­gi­neer to carry out a de­tailed in­ves­ti­ga­tion, in­spect and as­sess the con­di­tion of other ducts in the cinema, and rec­om­mend rec­ti­fi­ca­tion mea­sures.</p>
    <p>One movie­goer, who wanted to be known only as Ms Vivian, was watch­ing the movie Tenet with her family in an­other cinema hall when the in­ci­dent hap­pened.</p>
    <p>“The lights sud­denly came on for a few min­utes, but the movie was still play­ing, so we thought it was noth­ing se­ri­ous. But when the movie sud­denly got shut off, some peo­ple got a bit an­gry and things were a lit­tle chaotic. Even­tu­ally, the staff told us to evac­u­ate,” said the 24-year-old bank an­a­lyst.</p>
    <p>“We are very shocked by the in­ci­dent, and we prob­a­bly won’t dare to visit that par­tic­u­lar cinema (at Nex) in fu­ture. I re­ally hope the in­jured are fine,” she added.</p>
    <p>When ST ar­rived at the scene at 7pm, the cinema was half­shut­tered. Movie­go­ers were given com­pli­men­tary vouch­ers for other Shaw The­atres cine­mas. They have a one-month va­lid­ity and can be claimed for any movie at any time.</p>
    <p>A cus­tomer, who wanted to be known only as Ms Sim, had a ticket to watch Tenet at 7.50pm and was given a voucher. “I don’t have any­thing planned for the evening, so I will be look­ing at other movie tim­ings for Tenet near the area, per­haps at Sele­tar Mall,” she said.</p>
