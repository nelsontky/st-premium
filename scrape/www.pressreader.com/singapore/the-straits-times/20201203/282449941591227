    <p>Foot­ball fans will be able to catch a game from in­side a sta­dium on Satur­day for the first time since Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL) matches started to be held be­hind closed doors on March 14.</p>
    <p>A max­i­mum of 200 fans – 150 home and 50 away – will be al­lowed into the stands at Our Tampines Hub to watch Tampines Rovers take on Gey­lang In­ter­na­tional on Satur­day, sub­ject to manda­tory Covid-19 test­ing and safe-dis­tanc­ing pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong made the an­nounce­ment in a Face­book post yes­ter­day, say­ing: “Our fans are the lifeblood of sport­ing events.</p>
    <p>“It has been 6 weeks since the AIA Sin­ga­pore Premier League re­sumed. Whilst many have gone on­line to watch the ac­tion, it is re­ally not quite the same as be­ing in the sta­dium, in the thick of the ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“This is part of a pi­lot for fans to en­joy a live match ex­pe­ri­ence in a safe man­ner. I know this will ex­cite many SPL fans out there, es­pe­cially since we could see a lo­cal team be­ing crowned SPL cham­pi­ons for the first time since 2014!”</p>
    <p>The Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (FAS) con­firmed in a state­ment that those with tick­ets are re­quired to un­dergo a free anti­gen rapid test (ART) on-site at three stag­gered tim­ings from 2.15pm to 5pm be­fore the 5.30pm kick-off. Late­com­ers may be de­nied en­try into the venue.</p>
    <p>Fans who want to at­tend the match can buy their tick­ets only at fas.org.sg/tick­ets</p>
    <p>Tampines fan Pang Jia Tai, 28, vis­ited the web­site to buy tick­ets af­ter hear­ing the news.</p>
    <p>“Sup­port­ing your team from the stands is def­i­nitely a dif­fer­ent feel­ing from watch­ing the game from any­where else. I miss it for sure,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing the ART as a form of safe­guard also pro­vides some re­as­sur­ance to fans and or­gan­is­ers, and hope­fully things will grad­u­ally open up more in lo­cal foot­ball.”</p>
    <p>The 25th sea­son of the SPL kicked off on Feb 29, and crowds of over 2,500 watched matches be­tween Al­birex Ni­igata and Gey­lang, and Tan­jong Pa­gar and Lion City Sailors. How­ever, only six games were played be­fore matches had to be moved be­hind closed doors as a pre­ven­tive mea­sure to curb the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>FAS pres­i­dent Lim Kia Tong said that a suc­cess­ful pi­lot would be crit­i­cal for the re­turn of fans at all venues next sea­son.</p>
    <p>He added: “While they have been able to fol­low the ac­tion through the live broad­casts, noth­ing can re­place the feel­ing of cheer­ing your team on in the flesh from the stands. Of course, it is im­per­a­tive that they ad­here strictly to all the nec­es­sary mea­sures to en­sure the safety of them­selves and oth­ers present.</p>
    <p>“The pres­ence of sup­port­ers will also be a morale boost for the teams and play­ers.”</p>
