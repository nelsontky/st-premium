    <p>The dis­tri­bu­tion of TraceTo­gether to­kens will be ramped up from this month, as the au­thor­i­ties move to im­prove Sin­ga­pore’s con­tact trac­ing net­work. Over 100,000 to­kens have been col­lected since the dis­tri­bu­tion ex­er­cise be­gan at 20 com­mu­nity cen­tres on Sept 14, and this will grad­u­ally be ex­panded to about 100 lo­ca­tions is­land­wide.</p>
    <p>The dis­tri­bu­tion of TraceTo­gether to­kens will in­ten­sify from this month, with the au­thor­i­ties aim­ing to ex­pand Sin­ga­pore’s con­tact trac­ing net­work to 75 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion as the coun­try opens up fur­ther.</p>
    <p>More than 100,000 to­kens have been col­lected since they were made avail­able at 20 com­mu­nity cen­tres from Sept 14, in ad­di­tion to some 2.4 mil­lion down­loads of the TraceTo­gether app.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of col­lec­tion points will grad­u­ally be in­creased to about 100 lo­ca­tions is­land­wide.</p>
    <p>A fur­ther 18 com­mu­nity cen­tres were added last Fri­day, in­clud­ing in Bis­han and Ang Mo Kio, while mo­bile booths will be de­ployed at var­i­ous malls over the com­ing weeks, said the Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment Group yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The lo­cally de­vel­oped TraceTo­gether pro­gramme helps with con­tact trac­ing ef­forts by iden­ti­fy­ing nearby to­kens or phones with the app in­stalled, en­abling the au­thor­i­ties to iden­tify a per­son’s close con­tacts if needed.</p>
    <p>Senior Min­is­ter of State for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion Janil Puthuc­heary noted that cur­rent down­loads of the app rep­re­sent around 40 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­la­tion. “If we have more than 75 per cent of our pop­u­la­tion on the pro­gramme, the con­fi­dence that we have for us­ing this tool for rapid and ef­fec­tive con­tact trac­ing is trans­for­ma­tive.”</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment is mak­ing the use of the app or to­ken com­pul­sory for large gath­er­ings and higher-risk ac­tiv­i­ties as Sin­ga­pore opens up, he told re­porters dur­ing a visit to a mo­bile booth at Be­dok Mall yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A pi­lot scheme re­quir­ing peo­ple to use the to­ken or app to check in at cer­tain venues will start this month.</p>
    <p>Dr Janil said he hoped the mo­bile booths will reach out to peo­ple who might not ac­tively col­lect the to­kens. “And that’s the key is­sue. It’s to make sure we have ac­cess to as many seg­ments of our Sin­ga­pore pop­u­la­tion as pos­si­ble,” he said.</p>
    <p>The move to beef up con­tact trac­ing to guard against po­ten­tial Covid-19 out­breaks comes at a time when some ac­tiv­i­ties, like ca­sual week­end foot­ball games, are flout­ing rules re­strict­ing groups to no larger than five peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times saw eight-aside games tak­ing place with makeshift goal posts at a pop­u­lar com­mu­nity spot in Hougang.</p>
    <p>Checks re­vealed sim­i­lar scenes in com­mu­nity sports fa­cil­i­ties in Ang Mo Kio, Bukit Ba­tok, Bukit Merah, Seran­goon and Tampines.</p>
    <p>Over on Sen­tosa, the beaches were filled with peo­ple, two weeks be­fore guests will be re­quired to make on­line book­ings ahead of their vis­its dur­ing peak pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors to the Palawan and Siloso beach zones were is­sued wrist­bands that al­lowed them to ac­cess only the spe­cific zone for that band.</p>
    <p>A Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment spokesman said Covid-19 re­mains a se­ri­ous threat, and urged the pub­lic to re­main vig­i­lant to avoid a resur­gence of cases.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry yes­ter­day re­ported 12 new Covid-19 cases, in­clud­ing two i n the com­mu­nity. These brought the to­tal to 57,812.</p>
    <p>Re­tiree Yow Chun Wah, 69, was at Be­dok Mall to col­lect his TraceTo­gether to­ken yes­ter­day. “I don’t think tak­ing the to­ken along with me will be a has­sle when I go out,” he said. “There’s not much dif­fer­ence for se­niors like my­self be­cause I will just hang it around my neck like I al­ready do with my NRIC.”</p>
    <p>The full dis­tri­bu­tion sched­ule and list of lo­ca­tions can be found at https://to­ken.gowhere.gov.sg</p>
    <p>There were 12 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed as at yes­ter­day af­ter­noon, in­clud­ing two com­mu­nity cases and six im­ported cases.</p>
    <p>Ten of the cases are asymp­to­matic and de­tected from proac­tive screen­ing, while two had symp­toms.</p>
    <p>The lat­est in­crease takes Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal num­ber of cases to 57,812.</p>
    <p>One of the com­mu­nity cases is a work pass holder, while the other is a work per­mit holder.</p>
    <p>One of them was de­tected un­der the Min­istry of Health’s (MOH) en­hanced com­mu­nity test­ing of all in­di­vid­u­als aged 13 and above who are di­ag­nosed with acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion at first pre­sen­ta­tion to a doc­tor.</p>
    <p>The other com­mu­nity case was de­tected as a re­sult of the rou­tine test­ing of work­ers in the con­struc­tion, marine and process sec­tors who are liv­ing out­side of dor­mi­to­ries. He is asymp­to­matic, said MOH.</p>
    <p>Con­tact trac­ing is un­der way. All iden­ti­fied close con­tacts have been iso­lated and quar­an­tined, and will be tested for the Covid-19 virus.</p>
    <p>On the im­ported cases, MOH said all of them were al­ready in quar­an­tine be­fore they tested pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Two of them are Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dents who re­turned to Sin­ga­pore from In­dia on Sept 22 and 23.</p>
    <p>Three other cases are work pass or work per­mit hold­ers cur­rently em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore. The three ar­rived from the Nether­lands on Sept 22, the Philip­pines on Sept 22 and In­done­sia on Oct 1.</p>
    <p>The last im­ported case is a de­pen­dant’s pass holder who flew in from Ja­pan on Sept 22.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing four cases yes­ter­day are made up of work­ers re­sid­ing in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>All of them were de­tected through sur­veil­lance test­ing, such as the bi-weekly rou­tine test­ing of work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has in­creased from an av­er­age of fewer than one case per day in the week be­fore to an av­er­age of two cases in the past week. The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also in­creased from an av­er­age of fewer than one case per day in the week be­fore to an av­er­age of one case in the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>With 13 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,560 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 43 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 167 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, the virus out­break, which be­gan in De­cem­ber last year, has in­fected more than 35 mil­lion peo­ple. More than one mil­lion peo­ple have died.</p>
