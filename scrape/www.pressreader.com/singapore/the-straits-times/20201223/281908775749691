    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Hack­ers broke into sys­tems used by top Trea­sury of­fi­cials dur­ing a mas­sive cy­ber at­tack on US gov­ern­ment agen­cies and may have stolen es­sen­tial en­cryp­tion keys, ac­cord­ing to a se­nior law­maker.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment af­ter a brief­ing on Mon­day for com­mit­tee staff mem­bers, Sen­a­tor Ron Wy­den of Ore­gon said the Trea­sury Depart­ment had ac­knowl­edged that it “suf­fered a se­ri­ous breach, be­gin­ning in July, the full depth of which isn’t known”.</p>
    <p>Mr Wy­den, who sits on both the Se­nate In­tel­li­gence and Fi­nance com­mit­tees, said af­ter the closed­door brief­ing that the hack at the Trea­sury Depart­ment “ap­pears to be sig­nif­i­cant”.</p>
    <p>Dozens of e-mail ac­counts were com­pro­mised, he said in a state­ment. “Ad­di­tion­ally, the hack­ers broke into sys­tems in the depart­men­tal of­fices di­vi­sion of Trea­sury, home to the depart­ment’s high­est-rank­ing of­fi­cials,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Trea­sury still does not know all of the ac­tions taken by hack­ers, or pre­cisely what in­for­ma­tion was stolen,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Wy­den and Se­nate Fi­nance Com­mit­tee chair­man Chuck Grass­ley had asked to meet Trea­sury and In­ter­nal Rev­enue Ser­vice (IRS) of­fi­cials af­ter the dis­cov­ery of the data breach af­fect­ing mul­ti­ple agency sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft told the Trea­sury Depart­ment that dozens of e-mail ac­counts were com­pro­mised, the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>Mr Wy­den added that the IRS had said there was no ev­i­dence it had been com­pro­mised or data on tax­pay­ers taken.</p>
    <p>At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Wil­liam Barr on Mon­day joined other ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials, in­clud­ing Sec­re­tary of State Michael Pom­peo, in point­ing at Rus­sia for be­ing be­hind the hack.</p>
    <p>“It cer­tainly ap­pears to be the Rus­sians, but I’m not go­ing to dis­cuss it be­yond that,” Mr Barr, whose last day in of­fice is to­day, said, con­tra­dict­ing Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump who sug­gested China may have been re­spon­si­ble.</p>
    <p>It has been re­ported that the hack­ers had in­stalled a ma­li­cious vul­ner­a­bil­ity in soft­ware from Texas-based So­lar­Winds, whose cus­tomers in­clude top gov­ern­ment agen­cies and For­tune 500 com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>All fed­eral civil­ian agen­cies were or­dered by the US Cy­ber­se­cu­rity and In­fra­struc­ture Se­cu­rity Agency to re­view their net­works and dis­con­nect or power down So­lar­Winds’s Orion soft­ware prod­ucts im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>Mr Wy­den sharply crit­i­cised the gov­ern­ment for not tak­ing stronger mea­sures to pro­tect its sys­tems. The at­tack hap­pened de­spite “years of gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials ad­vo­cat­ing for en­cryp­tion back­doors” with the gov­ern­ment “ig­nor­ing warn­ings from cy­ber se­cu­rity ex­perts who said that en­cryp­tion keys (have) be­come ir­re­sistible tar­gets for hack­ers”.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts say they fear far more of the gov­ern­ment could be af­fected, in­clud­ing US in­tel­li­gence bod­ies, given the ubiq­uity of the So­lar­Winds se­cu­rity soft­ware.</p>
