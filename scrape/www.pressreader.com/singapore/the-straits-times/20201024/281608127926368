    <p>The Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) has said that it de­layed fil­ing a po­lice re­port against for­mer Tem­busu Col­lege fel­low Jeremy Fer­nando to take into ac­count the wel­fare of the stu­dents in­volved.</p>
    <p>Dr Fer­nando was sacked on Oct 7 fol­low­ing al­le­ga­tions of sex­ual mis­con­duct made against him by two stu­dents. NUS said on Wed­nes­day it had made a po­lice re­port, “given the se­ri­ous­ness of the al­le­ga­tions”.</p>
    <p>Both stu­dents had al­leged that Dr Fer­nando made non-con­sen­sual ad­vances to­wards them.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, col­lege rec­tor Tommy Koh con­ceded there was “a con­sid­er­able gap” be­tween the date the univer­sity fired Dr Fer­nando and when it made a po­lice re­port. “The univer­sity will de­lay re­port­ing to the po­lice if they feel that by re­port­ing to the po­lice, you may cause the vic­tim to self-harm... or by re­port­ing to the po­lice, you will se­ri­ously harm the men­tal health of the com­plainant or make the re­cov­ery dif­fi­cult, if not im­pos­si­ble,” said Pro­fes­sor Koh.</p>
    <p>“But at the end of the day, the univer­sity can­not not re­port,” he added, cit­ing NUS’ le­gal obli­ga­tion to re­port sus­pected crimes to the po­lice.</p>
    <p>NUS had said ear­lier that its staff spoke to both stu­dents about mak­ing a po­lice re­port on mul­ti­ple oc­ca­sions be­tween Aug 31 and Oct 7. But both de­cided against do­ing so.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, the As­so­ci­a­tion of Women for Ac­tion and Re­search (Aware) ques­tioned NUS’ de­ci­sion to file a po­lice re­port when the al­leged vic­tims had de­cided not to.</p>
    <p>Prior to th­ese al­le­ga­tions, Tem­busu Col­lege mas­ter Kelvin Pang said there were no “red flags” re­gard­ing Dr Fer­nando, who taught cross-dis­ci­plinary mod­ules, pri­mar­ily fo­cus­ing on phi­los­o­phy and lit­er­a­ture. He said the col­lege con­ducts ref­er­ence checks and eval­u­a­tions when hir­ing new fel­lows.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times re­ported ear­lier that in a pa­per which was part of a 2017 book he wrote, Dr Fer­nando wrote that “in­sem­i­na­tion” can be a part of teach­ing and could open up stu­dents and teach­ers to pos­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Pulling out a book­marked copy of the book, Prof Koh said he had not read the book be­fore. “If I had read this en­try be­fore, when it came out in 2017, I would have coun­selled Dr Fer­nando,” he said.</p>
    <p>Asked if more will be done to ed­u­cate stu­dents and staff on con­sent fol­low­ing this in­ci­dent, NUS dean of stu­dents Leong Ching noted that the univer­sity has an ex­ist­ing mod­ule called Re­spect And Con­sent. It was ear­lier re­ported that Dr Fer­nando had played a role in craft­ing a con­sent work­shop.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to this, As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Leong said: “Many of us had in­puts to (the mod­ule and it is) larger than one per­son... It con­tin­u­ally needs to speak to new con­texts and new needs.”</p>
    <p>In this #MeToo era, Prof Koh said, stu­dents are aware of their rights and much more will­ing to voice out if th­ese are vi­o­lated. The #MeToo move­ment took off in 2017 when al­le­ga­tions against Hol­ly­wood mogul Har­vey We­in­stein led to many women shar­ing ex­pe­ri­ences of sex­ual as­sault or ha­rass­ment.</p>
    <p>Even then, “it is im­pos­si­ble for us to pre­vent a fu­ture Dr Fer­nando”. “None of us knew he was a sex­ual preda­tor,” said Prof Koh.</p>
