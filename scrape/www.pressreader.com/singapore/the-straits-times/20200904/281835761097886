    <p>•</p>
    <p>China’s “vul­gar threats” over a visit by the Czech Re­pub­lic’s Se­nate Speaker to Tai­wan are like a cold, un­wel­come win­ter wind and con­trast with the cour­te­ous words the Speaker of­fered while in Tai­wan, a se­nior Tai­wanese politi­cian said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>China, which claims Tai­wan as its sov­er­eign ter­ri­tory, has con­demned Czech Se­nate Speaker Mi­los Vys­tr­cil for go­ing there. The Chi­nese govern­ment’s top diplo­mat Wang Yi said this week he would pay a “heavy price” for vis­it­ing the demo­cratic is­land.</p>
    <p>Mr Vys­tr­cil de­clared him­self to be Tai­wanese in a speech at Tai­wan’s Par­lia­ment on Tues­day, chan­nelling the late United States pres­i­dent John F. Kennedy’s de­fi­ance of com­mu­nism in Ber­lin in 1963, fur­ther an­ger­ing Bei­jing but win­ning plau­dits in Taipei.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing with Mr Vys­tr­cil by his side in Taipei, Tai­wan Par­lia­ment Speaker You Si-kun praised his “stir­ring” speech at the leg­is­la­ture.</p>
    <p>Mr Vys­tr­cil “was gen­tle and el­e­gant, a paragon of a cul­tured coun­try, like spring sun­shine, splen­did and warm – Tai­wan’s peo­ple were deeply moved”, Mr You said.</p>
    <p>“Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi’s vul­gar threats, how­ever, were like a cold, un­wel­come win­ter wind that cause dis­com­fort.”</p>
    <p>Mr Vys­tr­cil said he had in­vited Mr You to lead a del­e­ga­tion to Prague for what he termed a “work­ing visit”, and dis­missed China’s crit­i­cisms.</p>
    <p>“Of course I don’t like the state­ments, but I do not feel I have crossed a red line what­so­ever, as I don’t think we did any­thing that was an in­fringe­ment of the ‘one China’ pol­icy as the Czech Re­pub­lic has it within its for­eign pol­icy,” he said, speak­ing through an in­ter­preter. “As I have al­ways said, demo­cratic and free coun­tries should al­ways co­op­er­ate. There’s noth­ing to be changed on that ap­proach.”</p>
    <p>The Czech Re­pub­lic, like most coun­tries, has no for­mal diplo­matic ties with Tai­wan. China de­mands coun­tries it has re­la­tions with ac­cept that Tai­wan be­longs to “one China”. Tai­wan has shown no in­ter­est in be­ing run by China.</p>
