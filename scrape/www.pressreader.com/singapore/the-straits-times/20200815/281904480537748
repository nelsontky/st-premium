    <p>• US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said on Thurs­day he had heard Demo­cratic vice-pres­i­den­tial run­ning mate Ka­mala Har­ris was not el­i­gi­ble to serve, stok­ing a false claim echo­ing the base­less “birther” the­ory he pro­moted about former pres­i­dent Barack Obama.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump was asked about “claims cir­cu­lat­ing on so­cial me­dia” that Ms Har­ris was not el­i­gi­ble and whether she met the le­gal re­quire­ments for vice-pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>“I heard it to­day that she doesn’t meet the re­quire­ments. And, by the way, the lawyer that wrote that piece is a very highly qual­i­fied, very tal­ented lawyer. I have no idea if that’s right,” Mr Trump said.</p>
    <p>“I would have as­sumed the Democrats would have checked that out be­fore she gets cho­sen to run for vice-pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>“But that’s a very se­ri­ous – you’re say­ing that – they’re say­ing that she doesn’t qual­ify be­cause she wasn’t born in this coun­try.”</p>
    <p>The re­porter replied that Ms Har­ris was born in the US but her par­ents might not have been per­ma­nent res­i­dents at the time.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump ap­peared to be re­fer­ring to a Newsweek op-ed that wrongly claimed Ms Har­ris was not el­i­gi­ble to serve as vice-pres­i­dent be­cause of her par­ents’ im­mi­gra­tion sta­tus when she was born.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris was born in Oak­land, Cal­i­for­nia, in 1964, to a fa­ther from Ja­maica and a mother, from In­dia.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump earned national po­lit­i­cal promi­nence by pro­mot­ing the “birther” lie that Mr Obama, the US’ first black pres­i­dent, was not born in the US. He grudg­ingly ac­knowl­edged late in his 2016 pres­i­den­tial cam­paign that Mr Obama was born in the United States.</p>
    <p>In his Newsweek op-ed, Chap­man Univer­sity law pro­fes­sor John East­man claimed some “com­men­ta­tors” said Ms Har­ris was in­el­i­gi­ble as she was not a “nat­u­ral-born cit­i­zen” as her par­ents were not nat­u­ralised US cit­i­zens at the time of birth.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Con­sti­tu­tion, any nat­u­ral-born US cit­i­zen over the age of 35 is el­i­gi­ble to be pres­i­dent or vice-pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Con­sti­tu­tional law ex­pert Erwin Che­merin­sky said the claim “is a truly silly ar­gu­ment”.</p>
    <p>“Un­der Sec­tion 1 of the 14th Amend­ment, any­one born in the United States is a United States cit­i­zen. The Supreme Court has held this since the 1890s,” he said.</p>
    <p>Har­vard Law School pro­fes­sor of con­sti­tu­tional law Lau­rence H. Tribe said Prof East­man’s idea was “to­tal BS”.</p>
    <p>“I hadn’t wanted to com­ment on this be­cause it’s such an id­i­otic the­ory,” Prof Tribe told the pa­per.</p>
