    <p>Sin­ga­pore man­u­fac­tur­ing main­tained an ex­pan­sion mode in Novem­ber for a fifth straight month, but pulled back from the peak reached in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the elec­tron­ics sec­tor con­tin­ued to forge ahead, ex­pand­ing the most in more than two years.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts said the mixed pic­ture flags that the re­cent resur­gence of Covid-19 world­wide may have started to weigh down global de­mand.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Pur­chas­ing Man­agers’ In­dex (PMI) – a lead­ing in­di­ca­tor for as­sess­ing the state of the econ­omy – dipped 0.1 point from Oc­to­ber to post a slower ex­pan­sion at 50.4. The in­dex level in Oc­to­ber was its high­est since March last year when it was 50.8.</p>
    <p>A read­ing above 50 indi­cates ex­pan­sion; a read­ing be­low that num­ber points to a con­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>Marginally higher ex­pan­sion rates in new or­ders and new ex­ports helped the over­all man­u­fac­tur­ing PMI to hold above the ex­pan­sion line, said the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Pur­chas­ing and Ma­te­ri­als Man­age­ment (SIPMM), which com­piles the in­dex.</p>
    <p>The sup­plier de­liv­er­ies in­dex re­verted to ex­pan­sion af­ter con­tract­ing for nine months in a row.</p>
    <p>But the in­dex was dragged down by weaker ex­pan­sion rates of the in­ven­tory in­dex and out­put in­dex, as well as a faster con­trac­tion rate of the em­ploy­ment in­dex – record­ing its 10th con­sec­u­tive de­cline.</p>
    <p>The fin­ished goods in­dex recorded a slower rate of ex­pan­sion, whereas the in­dexes of both im­ports and in­put prices recorded faster rates of ex­pan­sion.</p>
    <p>SIPMM vice-pres­i­dent for in­dus­try en­gage­ment and de­vel­op­ment Sophia Poh said: “The lat­est PMI read­ing indi­cates the re­silience of the over­all man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor, with ex­pan­sion recorded for the fifth con­tin­u­ous month.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, fac­tory em­ploy­ment re­mains weak and man­u­fac­tur­ers re­main con­cerned about the im­pact on global de­mand aris­ing from new waves of the global pan­demic that could de­rail the man­u­fac­tur­ing re­cov­ery.”</p>
    <p>The elec­tron­ics PMI rose 0.1 point from Oc­to­ber to 51.1 – the fourth month of ex­pan­sion and the high­est since Septem­ber 2018, when the read­ing was 51.4.</p>
    <p>The elec­tron­ics growth was at­trib­uted to faster ex­pan­sion rates for new or­ders, new ex­ports, fac­tory out­put and em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>The elec­tron­ics em­ploy­ment in­dex has re­verted to a mar­ginal ex­pan­sion af­ter it first recorded con­trac­tion in Fe­bru­ary this year. Ex­cept for the in­dexes of elec­tron­ics in­ven­tory and sup­plier de­liv­er­ies, all other in­di­ca­tors recorded faster ex­pan­sion rates.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank chief econ­o­mist and head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy Se­lena Ling said: “The PMIs sug­gest that the growth mo­men­tum go­ing for­ward will not be smooth sail­ing and the ear­lier bounce driven by re­stock­ing and stock­pil­ing post-global lock­down may be fad­ing.”</p>
    <p>Look­ing ahead, the sta­bil­i­sa­tion of the man­u­fac­tur­ing and elec­tron­ics PMIs sug­gests that the econ­omy is un­likely to re­peat the growth ex­pan­sion seen in the third quar­ter, she cau­tioned.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor, aided by the elec­tron­ics in­dus­try, is likely to re­main the stal­wart for the nascent re­cov­ery story go­ing into early 2021,” she noted.</p>
