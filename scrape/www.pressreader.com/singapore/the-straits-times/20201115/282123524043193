    <p>After her 97-year-old mother died of pneu­mo­nia on June 1, Ms Yeo LiLi was un­able to ful­fil what she saw as her fil­ial duty.</p>
    <p>The older woman was a de­vout Bud­dhist who had been part of a 20-strong group that chanted prayers most days of the week, be­fore she be­came too frail to con­tinue at 90. But none of her fel­low devo­tees could go for the fu­neral ser­vice, which was lim­ited to 10 per­sons un­der Covid-19 re­stric­tions at that time.</p>
    <p>A lone monk chanted prayers at the fu­neral and only two other rel­a­tives, be­sides Ms Yeo, walked in pro­ces­sion be­hind her mother’s hearse. Some older rel­a­tives, who knew her mother well, could not at­tend be­cause they were ill.</p>
    <p>An only child who had been her wid­owed mother’s full-time care­giver for 10 years, Ms Yeo, 57, de­scribes the fu­neral as “leng leng qing qing” (a Man­darin phrase that means cold and com­fort­less).</p>
    <p>Ms Yeo, who is sin­gle and works in the ser­vices sec­tor, says: “There were things that I was not able to do for my mother be­cause of Covid-19 guide­lines.</p>
    <p>“She had been a mem­ber of the tem­ple for 20 years yet she could not have many peo­ple chant­ing for her. Luck­ily, she was not around to see that, but I felt the pain and my rel­a­tives did too.”</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has over­turned so­cial norms of dy­ing and griev­ing. Across the world, tra­di­tion­ally com­mu­nal events like wakes and funer­als have been scaled down as part of wide-rang­ing ef­forts to stem the spread of the pandemic.</p>
    <p>While griev­ing fam­i­lies in Sin­ga­pore ac­cepted that so­cial dis­tanc­ing was nec­es­sary, these mea­sures took an emo­tional toll dur­ing an al­ready dis­tress­ing time.</p>
    <p>Many be­reaved kin felt they failed to give their loved ones a proper send-off, which could im­pede their emo­tional heal­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Gla­dys So, a se­nior coun­sel­lor at Tsao Foun­da­tion, which pro­vides care and other ser­vices for the el­derly, says: “Covid has made peo­ple more lonely. The pandemic prompted many changes to our life­style, in­clud­ing to end-of-life prac­tices. ”</p>
    <p>Some of the be­reaved may blame them­selves for any “un­fin­ished business” in their loved one’s last days, she says. Lost op­por­tu­ni­ties for fi­nal con­ver­sa­tions and farewells, she fears, could be “re-trau­ma­tis­ing” weeks and months later.</p>
    <p>Ms Angjolie Mei, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of The Life Cel­e­brant, a fu­neral ser­vices firm, ob­serves: “There is more dis­en­fran­chised grief, such as for those not able to pay their fi­nal re­spects at the cre­ma­to­rium, due to Covid-19 re­stric­tions.”</p>
    <p>Dis­en­fran­chised grief, also known as hid­den or un­ac­knowl­edged grief, may be min­imised or poorly un­der­stood by oth­ers, which makes it harder to process.</p>
    <p>In her book, Dy­ing To Meet You: Con­fes­sions Of A Fu­neral Di­rec­tor, whose sec­ond edi­tion was pub­lished in July, Ms Ang re­counts how one man apol­o­gised in Teochew to his dead fa­ther in a eu­logy dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>He re­gret­ted not be­ing able to give his fa­ther, who died at 100, the grand fu­neral that he wanted.</p>
    <p>MOURN­ING FROM AFAR</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures from l ate March i ncluded lim­it­ing at­ten­dance at funer­als and wakes to fam­ily mem­bers as far as pos­si­ble, with a max­i­mum of 10 per­sons gath­er­ing at any one point.</p>
    <p>When re­stric­tions were re­laxed in phase two, which started on June 19, the limit was upped to 20 per­sons. Since early Au­gust, up to 30 per­sons may be present at any one time for wakes and funer­als.</p>
    <p>Other coro­n­avirus-re­lated changes to fu­neral prac­tices in­clude no live mu­sic or singing in groups and no catered buf­fets for mourn­ers, but op­tions like packed bento meals in­stead.</p>
    <p>Mr Calvin Tang, as­sis­tant gen­eral man­ager at fu­neral ser­vices firm Sin­ga­pore Cas­ket, says that some fam­i­lies found it too dif­fi­cult to de­cide who to turn away.</p>
    <p>Be­cause the ma­jor­ity of those who died were el­derly, they tended to have more sib­lings and came from larger fam­i­lies. Feel­ing un­able to limit vis­i­tors to 10 per­sons at any one time, some fam­i­lies pre­ferred to do away with a wake en­tirely and set­tle for a cre­ma­tion ser­vice, says Mr Tang.</p>
    <p>Shorter wakes, last­ing one to three days, were more of­ten re­quested in re­cent months, he</p>
    <p>My wish was for ev­ery­one to have clo­sure but it didn’t hap­pen. Los­ing Koon Beng... has taught me what it re­ally means not to take things for granted. I thought I knew that, but I re­alised I didn’t re­ally, un­til my hus­band fell very ill and un­til Covid-19 changed ev­ery norm we were used to. ’’ MS YVONNE FUNG (right, pic­tured with her late hus­band), who could not ful­fil his wish to see all his fam­ily mem­bers to­gether be­fore he died in June</p>
    <p>says, com­pared with three- or five­day wakes pre-Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mr Iskan­dar Dzulkhairi Ab­dul Aziz Ka­jai, op­er­a­tions man­ager at Sin­ga­pore Mus­lim Cas­ket and Mar­ble Con­trac­tor, has wit­nessed be­reaved fam­ily mem­bers giv­ing up their chance to be present at Covid-19-re­stricted Mus­lim buri­als, so their sib­lings can at­tend in­stead.</p>
    <p>A hand­ful bri­dled at the re­stric­tions over what is usu­ally a com­mu­nity event, feel­ing that “you can go to some­one’s fu­neral only once”, he notes.</p>
    <p>But he has also seen oth­ers who mourned from afar, park­ing their cars or mo­tor­bikes by the road and stand­ing at the perime­ter of the ceme­tery.</p>
    <p>“It’s a sym­bolic show of last re­spects to the de­ceased while prac­tis­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing,” he says.</p>
    <p>A LONELY DEATH</p>
    <p>For Ms Yvonne Fung, 42, car­ing for her hus­band while he was dy­ing dur­ing the pandemic meant that both of them lacked so­cial and fa­mil­ial sup­port.</p>
    <p>Her hus­band, Mr Tee Koon Beng, had been di­ag­nosed with lym­phoma two years ago. His con­di­tion wors­ened at the be­gin­ning of the year and he died at the age of 42 on June 12. Mar­ried for five years, the cou­ple, both for­mer teach­ers, have no chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Since Jan­uary, Ms Fung had been his main care­giver, after re­ceiv­ing train­ing from the hospi­tal on how to use a feed­ing tube and ad­min­is­ter pal­lia­tive care.</p>
    <p>He did not want vis­i­tors to come to their home as his im­mune sys­tem was weak. She had to rely on on­line shop­ping as she could not leave him alone. At times, al­co­hol swabs, which he needed, were out of stock in stores due to panic buy­ing dur­ing the early days of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“We were iso­lated but it didn’t feel lonely be­cause we had each other,” she says.</p>
    <p>Last year, when Mr Tee’s con­di­tion nose­dived, both their fam­i­lies had con­verged at the hospi­tal for a fi­nal farewell.</p>
    <p>He ral­lied but in June, two days</p>
    <p>be­fore he died, Ms Fung’s fam­ily – her par­ents and two broth­ers are based in Hong Kong – could not visit. They could only do a video call with him. Only his mother and three sib­lings were at his hospi­tal bed.</p>
    <p>“My fam­ily felt so bad that they could not fly in from Hong Kong after the bor­ders closed. He wanted to see ev­ery­one at one go and thought he could do the same as last year. It wasn’t easy for him to say good­bye,” she re­calls, speak­ing to The Sun­day Times via a video call from Hong Kong, where she is vis­it­ing her fam­ily.</p>
    <p>After Mr Tee’s wake, she re­mem­bers that more than 20 of his fam­ily mem­bers boarded a hired bus to Mandai Cre­ma­to­rium. More than half of them were pre­vented from at­tend­ing his fu­neral ser­vice as the limit was 10 per­sons then.</p>
    <p>“The un­der­taker had no­ti­fied us about the re­stric­tions, but our fam­ily mem­bers hoped to send my late hus­band to the far­thest point pos­si­ble. That was why they still boarded the bus,” she ex­plains.</p>
    <p>“My wish was for ev­ery­one to have clo­sure but it didn’t hap­pen. Los­ing Koon Beng, es­pe­cially dur­ing this Covid-19 sea­son, has taught me what it re­ally means not to take things for granted. I thought I knew that, but I re­alised I didn’t re­ally, un­til my hus­band fell very ill and un­til Covid-19 changed ev­ery norm we were used to.”</p>
    <p>THE HU­MAN TOUCH</p>
    <p>In July, Ms Fung went for grief coun­selling with Wi­care Sup­port Group, which sup­ports wid­ows and fa­ther­less chil­dren. She found it helped her to be with peo­ple who un­der­stood what she had gone through.</p>
    <p>At Wi­care, she could talk openly about her com­pli­cated feel­ings re­gard­ing loss. For in­stance, she found that she could not bear to look at her wed­ding ring. She took up a sug­ges­tion to place both rings – his and hers – in front of his pho­to­graph next to her bed­side. That way, she could look at them again with­out be­ing over­whelmed by grief.</p>
    <p>Ms Lena Soh, gen­eral man­ager of Wi­care Sup­port Group, notes that there are many prac­ti­cal ways to sup­port the be­reaved, some of which are un­for­tu­nately cur­tailed by the pandemic.</p>
    <p>“Tak­ing the kids to school, cook­ing a meal, com­ing over to clean the house – these are all forms of sup­port that are some­what lim­ited be­cause of Covid-19 re­stric­tions,” she says. “Hu­man pres­ence counts for a lot – be­ing there when words fail.”</p>
    <p>Since the pandemic has re­duced phys­i­cal con­tact, a hug or a ca­ress on the cheek may now have added value.</p>
    <p>Fu­neral ser­vices firm The Life Cel­e­brant of­fers a ser­vice, Show­ers of Love, which al­lows be­reaved fam­ily mem­bers to help to clean, dress and ap­ply make-up on the de­ceased.</p>
    <p>Ms Ang, the man­ag­ing di­rec­tor, says one client, whose mother died in April, was com­forted at be­ing able to touch her mother’s body one last time.</p>
    <p>There had been fewer op­por­tu­ni­ties for phys­i­cal con­tact when her mother was laid up in hospi­tal and then the hospice, be­fore she died.</p>
    <p>E-FUNER­ALS & E-EULOGIES</p>
    <p>As Zoom and other dig­i­tal con­nec­tions ex­ploded un­der Covid-19, tech­nol­ogy stood in the gap and pro­vided so­lace for the dy­ing and the be­reaved.</p>
    <p>At Dover Park Hospice, pet ther­apy ses­sions went vir­tual from June till Septem­ber, when such vol­un­teer ac­tiv­i­ties re­sumed.</p>
    <p>Some hospice res­i­dents were stroking the screen on the iPad when vol­un­teers’ dogs and rab­bits made an ap­pear­ance, says Ms Cheong Ee May, its head of so­cial work and psy­cho-so­cial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>One pa­tient, who was con­fined to his bed, watched his ther­a­pist tak­ing the route he used to walk at the hospice.</p>
    <p>He was happy when the ther­a­pist showed him his favourite fish pond on the live stream.</p>
    <p>Fu­neral ser­vices firms like Sin­ga­pore Cas­ket, Ang Chin Moh Fu­neral Di­rec­tors and Di­rect Fu­neral Ser­vices told The Sun­day Times there has been greater de­mand for livestream­ing ser­vices for funer­als.</p>
    <p>Ms Jenny Tay, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Di­rect Fu­neral Ser­vices, says: “Live-stream­ing funer­als has be­come more ac­cept­able. With many Sin­ga­porean fam­i­lies liv­ing abroad, this will prob­a­bly stay in the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>Ms Ang of The Life Cel­e­brant fore­sees a “rise in e-pek kim”. These con­do­lence do­na­tions were more read­ily made via e-pay­ments with so­cial dis­tanc­ing in place, and the ease of trans­fer is at­trac­tive for fu­ture use, she says.</p>
    <p>Some feel the greater so­cial iso­la­tion wrought by Covid-19 has been both bane and bless­ing.</p>
    <p>Civil ser­vant Irene Teo, 40, says the pandemic made her fam­ily fo­cus on what was es­sen­tial when her mother, 68-year-old Ng Poh Hua, died of bile duct cancer on April 16.</p>
    <p>“The re­stric­tion on numbers helped us nar­row down who we re­ally needed to be present at the fu­neral. We also en­sured that my mother was see­ing the peo­ple she re­ally wanted to, while she was in the hospice,” says Ms Teo, who has an el­der sis­ter. Her 70-year-old fa­ther is a re­tired taxi driver.</p>
    <p>FaceTim­ing daily with her boyfriend in the Nether­lands also gave her com­fort.</p>
    <p>But in the end, she says only she can do the work of re­cov­er­ing from grief. “With­out Covid-19, I prob­a­bly would have gone trav­el­ling to get away from it all. Stay­ing in Sin­ga­pore has given me the soli­tude and space to have a real con­ver­sa­tion with my­self,” she says.</p>
    <p>“Maybe it’s a bless­ing in dis­guise, that I’m fully fac­ing the new re­al­ity of life with­out my mum.”</p>
