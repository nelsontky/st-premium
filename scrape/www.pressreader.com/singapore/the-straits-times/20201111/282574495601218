    <p>Read­ers wrote i n about their cy­cling ad­ven­tures dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, fol­low­ing an ar­ti­cle last Wed­nes­day ti­tled Zen And The Joy Of Cy­cling. Here are some of their re­sponses.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian house­wife Mu­tia Des­tami­nata, 34, and her friends have been cy­cling ev­ery Sun­day, start­ing as early as 6am, since July.</p>
    <p>Their three-hour rides start­ing from Pung­gol have taken them to nearby places such as Coney Is­land and Sengkang River­side Park and fur­ther to Changi Vil­lage, East Coast Park and Ma­rina Bay.</p>
    <p>The Ma­rina Bay area is also a hot spot for cy­clists in­clud­ing fi­nan­cial con­sul­tant Phua Sin Hui and her fi­ance Ben­jamin Khew, an op­er­a­tions man­ager.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple, who de­clined to share their ages, bought their fold­able bi­cy­cles last month so they could ride con­ve­niently any time. They usu­ally cy­cle at night af­ter work from Bis­han Park to Kal­lang and Ma­rina Bay.</p>
    <p>Ms Phua says: “I get to put aside the pres­sures of work and daily life for a bit and just en­joy the cool­ing breeze and city lights.”</p>
    <p>Re­tiree Chan Kum Lang, 71, has been cy­cling a lot more since the cir­cuit breaker in April. Once, the for­mer man­ager in a food court cy­cled 58km from his home in Up­per Seran­goon to Changi Vil­lage and Changi Coastal Road and back.</p>
    <p>He says: “Most of the benches and beach area (at Changi) were cor­doned off to pre­vent peo­ple from fish­ing, swim­ming and con­gre­gat­ing. The en­tire stretch was deserted, ex­cept for a few cy­clists or ve­hi­cles that zoomed past me oc­ca­sion­ally.”</p>
    <p>Brunei’s for­mer min­is­ter of in­dus­try and pri­mary re­sources, Pe­hin Dato Yahya Bakar, 66, who has been in Sin­ga­pore since March as his wife is un­der­go­ing can­cer treat­ment here, says cy­cling in Sin­ga­pore is “an op­por­tu­nity not to be missed”.</p>
    <p>The avid cy­clist says cy­cling here has al­lowed him to get to know Sin­ga­pore bet­ter.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, he has learnt of places such as the for­mer Si­mon Road Mar­ket in Up­per Seran­goon, which has stat­ues of farm­ers sell­ing chicken and ducks, in re­mem­brance of the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“Most road users are con­sid­er­ate and more re­cep­tive to slower road users like cy­clists,” he adds.</p>
