    <p>KHOMS (Libya) Twenty mi­grants have died in a ship­wreck off the Libyan coast, Doc­tors With­out Bor­ders (MSF) said, tak­ing to al­most 100 the death toll from two such Mediter­ranean tragedies on the same day.</p>
    <p>MSF teams in the north-west­ern city of Sor­man “as­sisted three women as the lone sur­vivors of an­other ship­wreck (on Thurs­day) where 20 peo­ple drowned”, the group said in a tweet on Friday.</p>
    <p>“Res­cued by lo­cal fish­er­men, they were in shock and ter­ri­fied; they saw loved ones dis­ap­pear be­neath the waves, dy­ing in front of their eyes,” MSF said.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier that day, the UN’s In­ter­na­tional Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Mi­gra­tion re­ported “a dev­as­tat­ing ship­wreck which claimed the lives of at least 74 mi­grants to­day off the coast of Khoms”, a port city east of Sor­man.</p>
    <p>It said 47 sur­vivors had been brought back to shore and 31 bod­ies re­trieved, adding that the boat was re­ported to be car­ry­ing more than 120 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Seven women were among the sur­vivors, Mr Mokhtar Salem Mo­hamed from Libya’s in­te­rior min­istry told Agence France-Presse at a mi­grants cen­tre in Khoms, some 120km east of the cap­i­tal Tripoli.</p>
    <p>Bod­ies from that ship­wreck were lined up grimly along the beach on Thurs­day, some still wear­ing life jack­ets.</p>
    <p>Trau­ma­tised sur­vivors sat i n shock on the shore, while oth­ers hud­dled un­der blan­kets as aid work­ers dis­trib­uted food parcels.</p>
    <p>One of the mi­grants told AFP of the tragedy.</p>
    <p>“Our boat sailed from an area near Tripoli two days ago,” said Mr Koni Has­san, from Ghana, adding that the en­gine “broke down yes­ter­day” re­sult­ing in the ship­wreck. “There were 120 peo­ple on board... many have died,” he added.</p>
    <p>The two ship­wrecks sparked calls for an end to the con­flict in Libya, where hu­man traf­fick­ers have taken ad­van­tage of per­sis­tent vi­o­lence since the 2011 over­throw of dic­ta­tor Muam­mar Qaddafi.</p>
    <p>The oil-rich North African coun­try has be­come a key em­barka­tion point for mi­grants, mostly from sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa, at­tempt­ing death-de­fy­ing voy­ages to Europe to flee war and poverty at home.</p>
    <p>While many have drowned at sea, thou­sands have been in­ter­cepted by the Libyan coast­guard, which has been backed by Italy and the Euro­pean Union, and re­turned to Libya.</p>
    <p>They mostly end up in de­ten­tion, of­ten in hor­rific con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>The US em­bassy to Tripoli said the ship­wrecks amounted to “an­other hor­rific mi­grant tragedy – an­other re­minder of the need for a set­tle­ment to the #Libya con­flict now in or­der to fo­cus on the preven­tion of tragedies like this”.</p>
