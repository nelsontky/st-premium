    <p>The re­cent bru­tal mur­der of Turk­ish stu­dent Pi­nar Gul­tekin ig­nited out­rage in Turkey. Un­for­tu­nately, cases like this have been on the rise in Turkey. Ac­cord­ing to news sources, a to­tal of 474 women were killed in Turkey in last year, a rise of</p>
    <p>200 per cent from 2013. It is thought that at least 146 women have been killed in the first six months of this year.</p>
    <p>And th­ese num­bers are ex­pected to go up by the end of the year due to ris­ing vi­o­lence aris­ing from the coro­n­avirus lock­down.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers, who had hoped that their ac­tions would cause the govern­ment to take ac­tion against the wide­spread do­mes­tic vi­o­lence prob­lem in the coun­try, were in­stead met with tear gas and rub­ber bul­lets.</p>
    <p>Ac­tivists claim that the</p>
    <p>Turk­ish govern­ment has done lit­tle to sup­port women in the coun­try. This has led to a move­ment on so­cial me­dia where women up­load black-and-white self­ies ac­com­pa­nied by the hash­tag #wom­en­su­p­port­ing­women and the text “chal­lenge ac­cepted”, with the aim of sup­port­ing and em­pow­er­ing women.</p>
    <p>As a teenage girl liv­ing in a pro­gres­sive and safe coun­try such as Sin­ga­pore, real­is­ing that femi­cide is preva­lent in other coun­tries such as Brazil, South Africa, Rus­sia and El Sal­vador makes me feel sym­pa­thetic to other women who are at risk of vi­o­lence. I hope that the so­cial me­dia chal­lenge leads to more aware­ness of the bru­tal­ity against women, which should have been erad­i­cated cen­turies ago.</p>
