    <p>The last time Liver­pool lost within 90 min­utes at An­field was against Chelsea (2-1 League Cup third-round de­feat) on Sept 26, 2018.</p>
    <p>Jur­gen Klopp ad­mit­ted Liver­pool could have no com­plaints af­ter they wasted a chance to book their place in the last 16 of the Cham­pi­ons League, but took out his frus­tra­tions on broad­caster BT Sport for sched­ul­ing yet an­other early kick-off on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The hosts could have guar­an­teed qual­i­fi­ca­tion from Group D with a vic­tory, giv­ing the man­ager the op­por­tu­nity to ro­tate his squad for the two re­main­ing games. But the Reds pro­duced a poor dis­play that was pun­ished by an im­pres­sive Ata­lanta side, who ran out 2-0 away win­ners on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Two goals in four min­utes from Josip Ili­cic and Robin Gosens in the sec­ond half gave the Serie A out­fit a mem­o­rable vic­tory that ended Liver­pool’s 100 per cent record in this year’s tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>The Reds had thrashed Ata­lanta 5-0 in Italy last month, but this time Klopp’s men looked vul­ner­a­ble at the back in a rare de­feat at An­field.</p>
    <p>The likes of Rhys Wil­liams, Divock Origi, Neco Wil­liams and Cur­tis Jones all started, but even when the Ger­man made changes in the sec­ond half by bring­ing on Diogo Jota, Fabinho, Roberto Firmino, Andy Robert­son and Takumi Mi­namino, his side were still list­less.</p>
    <p>Not only were they beaten for the first time in nine games in all com­pe­ti­tions, but it was their first loss within 90 min­utes at An­field since Septem­ber 2018, while also fail­ing to register a shot on tar­get against the Ital­ians.</p>
    <p>The Group D lead­ers still have des­tiny in their own hands – they need one win from their last two games to ad­vance – but Klopp had wanted to seal qual­i­fi­ca­tion early amid a hec­tic sched­ule.</p>
    <p>“A de­served de­feat in a dif­fi­cult game. The ref­eree didn’t whis­tle a lot and that makes it even more dif­fi­cult, for both sides It was un­be­liev­ably in­tense and you need some breaks,” he said.</p>
    <p>“When the first half is gone, you usu­ally set­tle but for some play­ers who didn’t play for a while, it was very in­tense for them. We didn’t find a way in the game.”</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing their Premier League 3-0 win over Le­ices­ter last week­end, Klopp hit out at broad­cast­ers Sky and BT Sport for their match sched­ul­ing and he turned the heat up on them again for mak­ing his side travel to Brighton and Hove Al­bion in the top flight on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>“I’m afraid to say but I think it (run­ning out of steam) could hap­pen not only to us but to other teams as well,” he said.</p>
    <p>“You (BT Sport) my spe­cial friends ask us to go on Satur­day at 12.30pm, which is nearly a crime to be hon­est. It has noth­ing to do with the game tonight but con­grat­u­la­tions for that. My only in­ter­est in the moment is that I get a thumbs up, no­body in­jured, let’s re­cover im­me­di­ately. We take it.”</p>
    <p>But for­mer Manch­ester United de­fender pun­dit Rio Fer­di­nand gave short shrift to Klopp’s com­plaints about the fix­ture jam, telling BT Sport: “Ev­ery­one’s in the same boat. It doesn’t make it right but when you look at the depth of his squad, they’re sit­ting in a bet­ter po­si­tion than most.”</p>
    <p>There was bet­ter news for Liver­pool yes­ter­day when they were among the Premier League clubs – along­side the likes of Chelsea, Ar­se­nal, West Ham, Brighton and Southamp­ton – given the green light for the re­turn of fans fol­low­ing an eight-month ab­sence. They are within tier-two ar­eas in Eng­land, mean­ing they can wel­come up to 2,000 fans when a month­long na­tional lock­down to con­tain the spread of Covid-19 is lifted on Wed­nes­day. But clubs in Manch­ester will have to wait longer af­ter Greater Manch­ester was clas­si­fied as be­ing in the very high alert zone in a list pub­lished by the govern­ment.</p>
