    <p>Profiles set up by The Sun­day Times on Su­gar­book and Seek­ingAr­range­ment, as both a sugar baby and a sugar daddy, re­ceived in­ter­est from other users within a day – proof that there is an ac­tive sugar-dat­ing com­mu­nity in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>On Seek­ingAr­range­ment, a sugar-baby pro­file re­ceived mes­sages from more than 40 sugar-daddy users, largely based in Sin­ga­pore, within 24 hours. Some users named a price up­front for meet-ups, based on the pro­file photo. Oth­ers asked for a “face and body” pic­ture in re­turn for set­ting a fee.</p>
    <p>On Su­gar­book, some of the sugar dad­dies stated that they were “mar­ried but look­ing”.</p>
    <p>Users have to de­clare them­selves aged 18 and above to sign up for both apps.</p>
    <p>But un­like other dat­ing apps, where users strike up a con­ver­sa­tion only when both par­ties are in­ter­ested, there is no such match­ing mech­a­nism on Seek­ingAr­range­ment and Su­gar­book.</p>
    <p>Both apps al­lowed for men and women to chat each other up freely.</p>
    <p>On both apps, users have to up­load pho­tos of them­selves be­fore their profiles are ap­proved. In par­tic­u­lar, Su­gar­book asks for clear, un­ob­scured pic­tures of users’ faces. But this can be cir­cum­vented by pay­ing for a pre­mium membership, which lets users be ac­tive with­out a pic­ture. This costs US$19.95 (S$27) a month for sugar ba­bies on Seek­ingAr­range­ment and US$13.95 a month on Su­gar­book.</p>
    <p>Sugar ba­bies, mostly in their 20s to early 30s, can chat and re­ply to men with a free membership on both apps. But sugar dad­dies, mostly in their 30s and 40s, are quickly prompted to up­grade to a pre­mium membership to read mes­sages sent by sugar ba­bies.</p>
    <p>Pre­mium mem­ber­ships for dad­dies cost US$79.95 a month on Su­gar­book and US$89.95 on Seek­ingAr­range­ment.</p>
