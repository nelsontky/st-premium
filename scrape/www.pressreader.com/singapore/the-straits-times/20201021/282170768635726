    <p>The is­sue of Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Air Force (RSAF) air­craft noise has again been brought up by many res­i­dents in Sengkang and Pung­gol.</p>
    <p>While the Min­istry of De­fence (Min­def) has re­it­er­ated that the RSAF has moved most of its high-in­ten­sity train­ing over­seas, most re­cently to Dar­win, com­plaints have con­tin­ued as work-from-home mea­sures con­tinue amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The crux of the prob­lem will not go away even af­ter Paya Le­bar Air Base is re­lo­cated from 2030, and com­plaints will ap­pear else­where.</p>
    <p>More po­ten­tial home own­ers must be ed­u­cated on the like­li­hood of air­craft noise in their es­tate even be­fore they place their bal­lots.</p>
    <p>The up­com­ing Ten­gah new town will again see sim­i­lar com­plaints if fu­ture home own­ers are not made aware of its prox­im­ity to Ten­gah Air Base.</p>
    <p>Paya Le­bar Air Base and Ten­gah Air Base have been around for decades, way be­fore many of th­ese es­tates were built.</p>
    <p>I saw this anal­ogy on­line: It’s like mov­ing into a dog-friendly es­tate, yet com­plain­ing about the dog and want­ing the dog to be re­moved be­cause of the bark­ing.</p>
    <p>The RSAF’s role is not lim­ited to Na­tional Day Pa­rade per­for­mances; its role is to rise and re­spond to any type of threat that may en­dan­ger Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Min­def and the RSAF have gone to great lengths to en­gage the com­mu­nity with base vis­its and out­reach ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Per­haps in the fu­ture, there could be more co­or­di­na­tion with the Hous­ing Board and the Min­istry of Na­tional Devel­op­ment to ed­u­cate po­ten­tial home own­ers on an es­tate’s prox­im­ity to air­bases, and why th­ese bases and their op­er­a­tions are so cru­cial to the na­tion’s se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>The RSAF’s role is not lim­ited to Na­tional Day Pa­rade per­for­mances; its role is to rise and re­spond to any type of threat that may en­dan­ger Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
