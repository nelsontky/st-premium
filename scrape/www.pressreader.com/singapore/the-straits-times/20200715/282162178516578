    <p>There is no doubt tech­nol­ogy can help im­prove ed­u­ca­tion. How­ever, I feel schools are not us­ing tech­nol­ogy ap­pro­pri­ately to aid teach­ing.</p>
    <p>Many teach­ers are try­ing to cope with us­ing a va­ri­ety of on­line meet­ing plat­forms to de­liver their lessons. In­stead, clus­ter su­per­in­ten­dents can en­cour­age schools un­der their su­per­vi­sion to pool re­sources.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, every teacher in a clus­ter can pre­pare and teach a few top­ics, video record the lessons and share the teach­ing ma­te­ri­als within the clus­ter.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents can watch the video and teach­ers can take the time dur­ing their on­line meet­ing ses­sions to ex­plain and deepen the stu­dents’ un­der­stand­ing of the top­ics in­stead.</p>
    <p>This is how many peo­ple are us­ing Udemy or Study.com for self-learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Over time, these study ma­te­ri­als will be valu­able as­sets. Teach­ers can save time teach­ing and fo­cus in­stead on en­gag­ing the stu­dents to make sure they are keep­ing up with their learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Schools are also try­ing hard to make use of the Stu­dent Learn­ing Space (SLS).</p>
    <p>The time spent on cre­at­ing and pre­par­ing those on­line ma­te­ri­als does not trans­late into bet­ter learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents also strug­gle to use it some­times and a lot of pre­cious time is wasted try­ing to com­plete very ba­sic and elementary tasks which they could eas­ily com­plete off­line.</p>
    <p>In­stead, teach­ers can spend time di­rect­ing stu­dents to do ex­tra read­ing and learn­ing us­ing re­sources that are al­ready avail­able on the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>I hope the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion can pro­vide lead­er­ship that em­pow­ers teach­ers rather than re­strict­ing them to work within guide­lines.</p>
