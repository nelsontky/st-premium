    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tish travel writer and trans­gen­der pi­o­neer Jan Mor­ris, who as a jour­nal­ist broke the 1953 news of Ed­mund Hil­lary’s con­quest of Ever­est, has died at the age of 94.</p>
    <p>“This morn­ing at 11.40 at Ys­byty Bryn Beryl, on the Llyn, the au­thor and trav­eller Jan Mor­ris be­gan her great­est jour­ney. She leaves be­hind on the shore her life-long part­ner, El­iz­a­beth,” her son Twm Mo­rys said in a state­ment on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Mor­ris, who first pub­lished un­der the name James, switched to Jan af­ter un­der­go­ing gen­der re­as­sign­ment surgery in 1972 and was the au­thor of more than three dozen books.</p>
    <p>She ranked highly among travel writers, with Pub­lish­ers Weekly once call­ing her “one of the most ad­mired and im­i­tated travel writers alive”.</p>
    <p>Her books in­clude Man­hat­tan ’45, about New York in 1945; Venice; the Pax Bri­tan­nica tril­ogy, about the de­cline of the Bri­tish Em­pire; and Co­nun­drum, about her tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Teacher and trans cam­paigner Deb­bie Hay­ton said Mor­ris’ 1974 mem­oir had been rev­e­la­tory, com­ing at a time when the only men­tion of trans peo­ple in the me­dia was sala­cious head­lines.</p>
    <p>“Wind the clock back 30 years ago and all we had was Jan Mor­ris’ book,” Ms Hay­ton told the Thom­son Reuters Foun­da­tion. “It was such a pi­o­neer­ing book that told her story when there were few other sto­ries like th­ese be­ing told.”</p>
    <p>A book of es­says, Al­le­go­riz­ings, mus­ings on age­ing and the com­plex­ity of life, will be pub­lished posthu­mously.</p>
    <p>In a BBC Art­snight in­ter­view with writer and broad­caster Michael Palin, him­self a renowned trav­eller, Mor­ris said her life had been “one self-cen­tred ex­er­cise in self-sat­is­fac­tion”.</p>
    <p>“I’ve en­joyed this life very much and I ad­mire it,” she said. “I think it’s been a very good and in­ter­est­ing life and I’ve made a whole of it quite de­lib­er­ately.”</p>
    <p>Born in Som­er­set, England, in 1926, Mor­ris and her part­ner, El­iz­a­beth, had five chil­dren – in­clud­ing their son Twm Mo­rys, a Welsh poet and mu­si­cian.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple re­mained to­gether since their 1949 mar­riage and lived in North Wales.</p>
    <p>In a 2008 in­ter­view with Reuters, Mor­ris said she had been “per­son­ally con­cerned with my own death for ages”.</p>
    <p>“About 30 years ago, I had our grave­stone cut,” she said.</p>
    <p>“It’s un­der the stairs at home; it has been there ever since. It’s got my own epi­taph, which is ‘Here are two friends – Jan and El­iz­a­beth Mor­ris – at the end of one life’.”</p>
    <p>Mor­ris told Reuters that she was “proud of her books”, say­ing her favourite was Tri­este And The Mean­ing Of Nowhere, which de­tailed her love af­fair with the Ital­ian city she first vis­ited as a sol­dier at the close of World War II.</p>
    <p>She spent much of her life in Wales, writ­ing ini­tially for Bri­tish news­pa­pers be­fore em­bark­ing on a ca­reer as a travel writer. In 2018, the Fi­nan­cial Times called Mor­ris “per­haps the best-trav­elled Bri­ton alive”.</p>
    <p>The re­cip­i­ent of many awards over her long ca­reer, she was awarded a CBE in the Queen’s Birthday Hon­ours list in 1999.</p>
    <p>Trib­utes about her flooded so­cial me­dia on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Best-sell­ing au­thor Kate Mosse tweeted that Mor­ris had been “an ex­tra­or­di­nary woman”.</p>
    <p>Mr Paul Jenk­ins, chief ex­ec­u­tive of The Tav­i­s­tock and Port­man NHS Foun­da­tion Trust, Bri­tain’s lead­ing gen­der iden­tity clinic, tweeted: “Her beau­ti­ful writ­ing touched so many of my worlds. A very spe­cial and lovely hu­man be­ing.”</p>
