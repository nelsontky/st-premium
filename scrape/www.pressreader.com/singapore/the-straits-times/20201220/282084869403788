    <p>1 FIC­TION/PO­ETRY THE OR­CHID FO­LIOS</p>
    <p>By Mok Zin­ing</p>
    <p>Ethos Books/Pa­per­back/144 pages/ $20.33/Ma­jor book­stores</p>
    <p>“To re­pot an or­chid, first loosen the roots’ hold on the soil.”</p>
    <p>In her de­but, Sin­ga­porean writer Mok Zin­ing un­tan­gles the or­chid from the sym­bol­ism it is so heav­ily en­twined with.</p>
    <p>“Ini­tially, I was drawn to or­chid diplo­macy and the way it was used in na­tional nar­ra­tives,” says Mok, 25, re­fer­ring to Sin­ga­pore’s tra­di­tion of nam­ing new or­chid hy­brids af­ter for­eign dig­ni­taries.</p>
    <p>“But later, it was just the strange­ness of orchids them­selves, how won­der­fully adapt­able and di­verse they are. Some of them look like an­i­mals; some of them look like bugs. I like orchids that look like birds.”</p>
    <p>Like the flow­ers that are its sub­ject, The Or­chid Fo­lios is a hy­brid – part-po­etry col­lec­tion, part-doc­u­men­tary novella. It is nar­rated in part by a fic­tional florist mourn­ing her late mother, who taught her ev­ery­thing she knew about orchids.</p>
    <p>In­ter­wo­ven with the nar­ra­tive are snip­pets of verse, es­say ques­tions on colo­nial­ism and even ad­ver­tise­ments for or­chid-in­spired prod­ucts, all of which ques­tion the ways in which Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional nar­ra­tive was trimmed and ar­ranged into what it is to­day.</p>
    <p>“A word is a cut­ting,” Mok writes, “a sen­tence a bou­quet.” Cut­tings, strewn in wa­ter, ab­sorb new mean­ings through fresh con­text.</p>
    <p>Mok, a dancer, is pur­su­ing a mas­ter of fine arts at the Univer­sity of Min­nesota, but had to re­turn to Sin­ga­pore in mid-March due to the Covid-19 out­break in the United States. She has worked on the col­lec­tion on and off since 2016.</p>
    <p>Though de­cep­tively slen­der, it is heav­ily re­searched. She trav­elled to London to visit Kew Gar­dens and the Royal Hor­ti­cul­tural So­ci­ety. She also looked at or­chid cut­tings more than a cen­tury old in the note­book of Botanic Gar­dens di­rec­tor Henry Ridley, who first reg­is­tered the hy­brid Vanda Miss Joaquim, Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional flower, in 1893.</p>
    <p>The hy­brid was thought for years to have been dis­cov­ered by Sin­ga­pore botanist Agnes Joaquim. It was only in this cen­tury that she was fi­nally recog­nised as hav­ing not stum­bled upon but cre­ated the Vanda Miss Joaquim, mak­ing her the first woman in the world to hy­bridise an or­chid.</p>
    <p>Mok has no floristry ex­pe­ri­ence, al­though af­ter her book was pub­lished, a reader who is a gar­dener gifted her a pha­laenop­sis hy­brid.</p>
    <p>She is work­ing on an­other book about sand and how it is used in recla­ma­tion and con­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>“I am drawn to ob­jects that al­ready have a lot of sym­bol­ism,” she says, “but what I’m re­ally look­ing for is the stuff that’s left out, that I can work with with­out re­peat­ing a cer­tain dom­i­nant nar­ra­tive.”</p>
    <p>With The Or­chid Fo­lios, she be­gan by de­con­struct­ing the or­chid as a sym­bol, but felt this to be un­pro­duc­tive to­wards the end.</p>
    <p>“I was stuck in this frame­work of orchids as a nat­u­ral thing, orchids as a com­mer­cialised thing, orchids as a na­tional sym­bol. I had to rad­i­cally change that.</p>
    <p>“In­stead of de­con­struc­tion, the fo­cus is more on growth and pos­si­bil­ity. The florist goes from ar­range­ments to ac­tu­ally grow­ing an or­chid.”</p>
