    <p>In deal­ing with the im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic, coun­tries and com­pa­nies should not ne­glect the loom­ing cli­mate crisis, pan­el­lists said on the sec­ond day of the Sin­ga­pore Sum­mit yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>As gov­ern­ments in­ject cap­i­tal to help economies re­cover, they can also in­vest in mak­ing their economies more sus­tain­able, through new sources of en­ergy or green jobs, said Mr Feike Si­jbesma, who is Covid-19 spe­cial en­voy for the Dutch gov­ern­ment. There is also a need to en­sure this tran­si­tion to a greener econ­omy is in­clu­sive, he said at a panel dis­cus­sion, stress­ing the im­por­tance of reskilling work­ers to the jobs of the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“If we switch from one (source of en­ergy) to an­other, coal mines in the middle of the United States are likely to close. We need to reskill these work­ers… (so that) we don’t leave peo­ple be­hind,” he added at the an­nual sum­mit, which gathers busi­ness and thought lead­ers to dis­cuss global trends. It is held vir­tu­ally this year due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The in­ter­na­tional econ­omy also has an obli­ga­tion to help coun­tries like Bangladesh that have been con­fronted with the neg­a­tive im­pacts of cli­mate change, Mr Si­jbesma told the panel on sus­tain­abil­ity, which was mod­er­ated by Sin­ga­pore’s am­bas­sador-at-large Chan Heng Chee.</p>
    <p>Agree­ing, Dr Ma Jun, chair­man of the green fi­nance com­mit­tee at the China So­ci­ety of Fi­nance and Banking, pointed to how var­i­ous in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions and coun­tries have been pro­vid­ing bi­lat­eral as­sis­tance for emerg­ing economies.</p>
    <p>China, for in­stance, has started im­ple­ment­ing a green tax­on­omy frame­work and has helped other emerg­ing economies adopt sim­i­lar frame­works to build up their domestic ca­pac­ity in green fi­nance, he said.</p>
    <p>Among other things, green tax­on­omy de­vel­ops re­quire­ments for com­pa­nies to dis­close the en­vi­ron­men­tal ben­e­fits of green projects and comes up with a def­i­ni­tion for what is con­sid­ered a green project.</p>
    <p>Mr Vi­jay Ad­vani, ex­ec­u­tive chair­man of in­vest­ment man­age­ment com­pany Nu­veen, said green bonds, which fi­nance in­vest­ment projects that ben­e­fit the en­vi­ron­ment, have started to take off and can be­come a great source of cap­i­tal for sus­tain­able growth.</p>
    <p>The mar­ket for green bonds grew by over 40 per cent last year, with over US$250 bil­lion (S$340 bil­lion) in such bonds is­sued last year, in­clud­ing by Ger­many, Switzer­land, Chile and Nige­ria, he said.</p>
    <p>At an­other panel dis­cus­sion on in­clu­sive growth, Dr Ju­dith Rodin said it would be a “ter­ri­ble mis­take” for gov­ern­ments to focus solely on the current Covid-19 crisis. The for­mer pres­i­dent of the Rock­e­feller Foun­da­tion said crisis has be­come</p>
    <p>“the new nor­mal” in the 21st cen­tury, point­ing to weather-in­duced as well as eco­nomic crises glob­ally.</p>
    <p>There­fore, there is an ur­gent need to pre­pare for the next great crisis and pre­vent it from dis­pro­por­tion­ately im­pact­ing poorer and vul­ner­a­ble groups, she said, call­ing for struc­tural changes such as ef­fec­tive shar­ing of data­bases to co­or­di­nate emer­gency re­sponses and en­hanc­ing col­lab­o­ra­tion across pub­lic, pri­vate and non-profit sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Dr Rodin noted that a huge trans­fer of wealth to mil­len­ni­als in de­vel­oped coun­tries will take place over</p>
