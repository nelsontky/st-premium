    <p>Over the past 10 years, the Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion (SBF) has be­come a prom­i­nent voice for Sin­ga­pore’s busi­ness com­mu­nity – in par­tic­u­lar, small en­ter­prises – said re­tir­ing chief ex­ec­u­tive Ho Meng Kit.</p>
    <p>Trade as­so­ci­a­tions and chambers have grown to be­come more col­lab­o­ra­tive in the past decade, and the SBF has taken on a more ac­tive role in rep­re­sent­ing the in­ter­ests of Sin­ga­pore busi­nesses on the in­ter­na­tional stage, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ho, 64, was speaking to re­porters last week, af­ter the SBF an­nounced that he will be leav­ing his post on Jan 1 next year, af­ter 10 years of ser­vice.</p>
    <p>The SBF set up the SME Com­mit­tee in 2011 to bet­ter rep­re­sent the in­ter­ests of small and medi­um­sized en­ter­prises (SMEs), with one of its key con­tri­bu­tions be­ing its yearly Bud­get rec­om­men­da­tions.</p>
    <p>The cham­ber’s mem­ber­ship has grown to 27,200 mem­bers, from 18,400 in 2011. Its staff size has also in­creased, with 150 em­ploy­ees now com­pared with 50 a decade ago.</p>
    <p>The SBF has also cre­ated more plat­forms for ac­tion, Mr Ho said. These in­clude the SBF Foun­da­tion, which has been an im­por­tant plat­form for en­cour­ag­ing busi­nesses to be more ac­tive in cor­po­rate so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity projects.</p>
    <p>The foun­da­tion will con­tinue to play a key role, Mr Ho said. “I think we’ll use that to ad­dress things like in­equal­ity in Sin­ga­pore, how to deal with the is­sue of hu­man se­cu­rity, in terms of low-wage work­ers (and) ma­ture work­ers, and... sus­tain­able em­ploy­ment.”</p>
    <p>BUSI­NESSES’ MIND­SET</p>
    <p>Many chal­lenges that SMEs faced 10 years ago, such as man­power costs, re­main to­day, said Mr Ho.</p>
    <p>To a cer­tain ex­tent, SMEs still have a mind­set of look­ing to the Govern­ment for sup­port and grants, he said.</p>
    <p>“There­fore, they can get a bit frus­trated some­times if they don’t un­der­stand the scheme, if the scheme is com­plex, cum­ber­some, not easy to ad­min­is­ter, or if re­im­burse­ment is not fast enough... They grum­ble about things like that.”</p>
    <p>But govern­ment poli­cies have shifted away from broad-based schemes to more tar­geted help, and busi­nesses sense this shift. They are aware that if they want to tap grants, they have to “work at it”, Mr Ho said.</p>
    <p>As busi­nesses con­tinue to grap­ple with the eco­nomic fall­out from the Covid-19 pan­demic, they need to pri­ori­tise the health and safety of their staff and work to grow their rev­enue, he said.</p>
    <p>The SBF has been tak­ing steps to help firms with over­seas mar­ket ac­cess, through means such as the Glob­alCon­nect@SBF pro­gramme sup­ported by En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore, Mr Ho said.</p>
    <p>The cham­ber is set­ting up two of­fices in Ho Chi Minh City to help Sin­ga­pore firms ven­ture into the city as well as Hanoi, he added.</p>
    <p>MOV­ING FOR­WARD</p>
    <p>The SBF has been vo­cal about ask­ing for more fi­nanc­ing out of the Te­masek port­fo­lio and will con­tinue to push for it, Mr Ho said.</p>
    <p>With time, SBF can be a gate­keeper for govern­ment fund­ing along­side the Sin­ga­pore in­vest­ment com­pany.</p>
    <p>“You can form a com­mit­tee as a sep­a­rate ven­ture, bring­ing in the busi­ness lead­ers who know the in­dus­try, who know the good peo­ple and good com­pa­nies, who un­der­stand mar­ket­ing, gov­er­nance,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It’s not some­thing we have gone into yet, but cer­tainly, this could be an­other plat­form for fu­ture ac­tion.”</p>
    <p>The SBF could also pool pri­vate sec­tor cap­i­tal and help ad­dress the fi­nanc­ing gap that SMEs face, Mr Ho said.</p>
    <p>While the cham­ber has worked closely with govern­ment agen­cies, it has been care­ful to en­sure that it is in­de­pen­dent and rep­re­sents the in­ter­ests of its mem­bers or busi­nesses, he noted.</p>
    <p>“If peo­ple see us... just like a statu­tory board, our use­ful­ness to the busi­ness com­mu­nity is less­ened, in­so­far as our rep­re­sent­ing them is con­cerned. So we have to tread a care­ful bal­ance,” he said.</p>
    <p>LIFE AF­TER RE­TIRE­MENT</p>
    <p>While Mr Ho is re­tir­ing as chief ex­ec­u­tive, he will still con­trib­ute to the busi­ness com­mu­nity as se­nior ad­viser to the SBF.</p>
    <p>He will also chair the Asia-Pa­cific Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion’s re­gional eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion work group, and con­tinue as a board mem­ber of the SBF Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>Spend­ing more time with his fam­ily, as well as on leisure golf­ing and walk­ing, is also on the cards.</p>
    <p>Mr Ho, who has five chil­dren and one grand­daugh­ter, said he hopes to travel abroad to visit them. Four of his chil­dren and his grand­daugh­ter reside over­seas.</p>
    <p>“I’ve only seen my grand­daugh­ter when she was seven days old in Lon­don. She’s now 10 months old. I’ve seen her grow up over the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>“It’s very sad, but at least there’s still the In­ter­net. I’m not the only one, there are many fam­i­lies like mine who are all sep­a­rated.”</p>
    <p>One of his sons, Sa­muel, 28, has a dis­abil­ity and is part of The Pur­ple Sym­phony, Sin­ga­pore’s largest in­clu­sive orches­tra. And Mr Ho is ea­ger to help the com­mu­nity of peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>He noted how the work­place par­tic­i­pa­tion rate among peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties drops off sig­nif­i­cantly af­ter they leave ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>“I hope to do some work to re­ally help cre­ate ac­ces­si­ble em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties for peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties,” he said.</p>
