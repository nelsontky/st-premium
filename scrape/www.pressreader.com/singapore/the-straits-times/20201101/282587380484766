    <p>I have searched for al­most 40 years for the per­fect won­ton noo­dles in Sin­ga­pore. Mostly in vain, un­til re­cently when I found two that came pretty close.</p>
    <p>Pop­u­larly called wan­ton mee here, it is such ubiq­ui­tous hawk­er­fare that it’s sur­pris­ing so few stalls do it well.</p>
    <p>I judge the dish by its three main com­po­nents.</p>
    <p>First, the egg noo­dles should be smooth and springy, not hard. Most im­por­tantly, they must not stick to the teeth.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond is ten­der and juicy bar­be­cued pork (char siew) that ideally comes in thick slices for a good bite.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, the won­tons should be plump with well-sea­soned minced pork bun­dled up in a flour wrap­per that is so thin and soft it looks like tis­sue pa­per when boiled. Alas, what you of­ten get in­stead is thick skin that dries up into a chewy lump with the folds stuck to­gether.</p>
    <p>As I tracked down one fa­mous stall af­ter an­other, it seemed im­pos­si­ble to find a stall in Sin­ga­pore that got all three right. Ei­ther the noo­dles or the won­tons were too hard, or the char siew was too lean, dry and streaked with red dye.</p>
    <p>The clos­est to what I am look­ing for is the Fei Fei Roasted Noo­dle stall in Jurong East, which makes my top five list. But its char siew pales in com­par­i­son to oth­ers, so it failed to clinch the No.1 spot.</p>
    <p>Over the past few weeks, I vis­ited 15 of Sin­ga­pore’s most feted stalls, many of which I had tried in the past. Stan­dards had slipped for some, while oth­ers stood the test of time.</p>
    <p>But vin­tage is not al­ways best. My favourite, Chef Kang’s Noo­dle House, is a rel­a­tive new­comer that opened only two years ago. It is also the most ex­pen­sive, though the price is jus­ti­fied by the gen­er­ous in­gre­di­ents and ex­cel­lent cook­ing.</p>
