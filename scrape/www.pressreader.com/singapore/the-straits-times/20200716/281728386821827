    <p>From rolling out dig­i­tal menus to pro­vid­ing din­ers with an­ti­sep­tic wipes for their cut­lery, eater­ies here are do­ing what they can to keep Covid-19 away.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Restau­rant As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore, which has more than 470 mem­bers, told The Straits Times that food and bev­er­age (F&B) op­er­a­tors are com­ply­ing with reg­u­la­tions, such as putting up signs to re­mind cus­tomers of safety mea­sures like safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Staff also en­sure that din­ers put their masks back on when they are done eat­ing and drinking.</p>
    <p>She said: “Be­ing in the ser­vice in­dus­try, nat­u­rally all F&B op­er­a­tors will gen­tly re­mind and en­cour­age their cus­tomers to put their masks back on when they are done with their meals.”</p>
    <p>Mr An­drew Tjioe, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Chi­nese restau­rant op­er­a­tor TungLok Group, said that in ad­di­tion to safety mea­sures such as tem­per­a­ture tak­ing for all din­ers and staff, the group’s restau­rants have also im­ple­mented other pre­cau­tions. These in­clude pro­vid­ing cus­tomers with food-grade dis­in­fect­ing wipes to clean their cut­lery be­fore din­ing, and hav­ing plas­tic par­ti­tions be­tween ta­bles at some of the restau­rants.</p>
    <p>TungLok Group has 15 restau­rant brands here, in­clud­ing Danc­ing Crab and TungLok Sig­na­tures.</p>
    <p>Mr Tjioe said: “Dine-in busi­ness is grad­u­ally re­turn­ing, as many are still cau­tious about vis­it­ing pub­lic places. But putting in place all the safety mea­sures has def­i­nitely given our din­ers more con­fi­dence in vis­it­ing us.</p>
    <p>“Many have given us pos­i­tive feed­back and ex­pressed their ap­pre­ci­a­tion for the mea­sures that we have im­ple­mented.”</p>
    <p>He added that staff have also been briefed to re­mind cus­tomers to put their masks back on when no longer eat­ing or drinking.</p>
    <p>He said: “Most din­ers have been mind­ful of this with­out be­ing re­minded. The re­main­ing are re­cep­tive of it with­out con­stant re­minders.”</p>
    <p>Mr Loh Lik Peng, di­rec­tor of the Un­listed Col­lec­tion group, which runs 18 food es­tab­lish­ments in­clud­ing Burnt Ends, agreed that cus­tomers and em­ploy­ees have taken to the safety mea­sures well.</p>
    <p>He said: “We re­quire our pa­trons to co­op­er­ate with us to en­sure every­one is safe and I do gen­uinely be­lieve that al­most all of our pa­trons recog­nise we do this for their own good. So far, we have en­coun­tered lit­tle dif­fi­culty with en­forc­ing the rules.”</p>
    <p>He added that en­sur­ing safety</p>
    <p>We try to go out on week­day nights when it is not too crowded and we make sure to sani­tise our hands be­fore eat­ing... It’s been good to be able to get out of the house and see­ing the safety mea­sures taken by restau­rants, we feel safe.</p>
    <p>FEEL­ING SAFE EAT­ING OUT</p>
