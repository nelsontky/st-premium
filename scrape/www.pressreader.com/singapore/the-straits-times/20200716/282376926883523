    <p>LON­DON • Bren­dan Rodgers be­lieves Le­ices­ter are in a “first-class” po­si­tion in their pur­suit of Cham­pi­ons League qual­i­fi­ca­tion, de­spite a shock Pre­mier League de­feat by Bournemout­h at the week­end.</p>
    <p>The Foxes suf­fered a 4-1 loss on Sun­day to rel­e­ga­tion-threat­ened Bournemout­h but re­mained in the top four on goal dif­fer­ence af­ter fifth-placed Manch­ester United’s 2-2 draw with Southamp­ton a day later.</p>
    <p>The two teams are tied on 59 points, four be­hind third-placed Chelsea, who have played a game more.</p>
    <p>With three rounds of fix­tures re­main­ing, the bat­tle for the Cham­pi­ons League spots could be set­tled on the fi­nal day of the sea­son, when Le­ices­ter host United at the King Power Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>“The des­tiny is al­ways with us. If that’s the case, we’re happy to ac­cept the re­spon­si­bil­ity and pres­sure,” man­ager Rodgers told a news con­fer­ence on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“That’s all you want. We have been up there for so long, we have fought to stay there and we are in a first-class po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>“We’ve had a dis­ap­point­ing re­sult so we have to move on from that. That’s the type of men­tal­ity we have al­ways had.”</p>
    <p>Le­ices­ter’s English pair Ben Chilwell (foot) and mid­fielder</p>
    <p>James Mad­di­son (hip) are a doubt for to­day’s league clash against Sh­effield United, while cen­tre­back Caglar Soyuncu is sus­pended for the rest of the sea­son af­ter his red card at Bournemout­h.</p>
    <p>“We’re ob­vi­ously still as­sess­ing Ben and James game by game, so</p>
    <p>Pre­mier League wins Le­ices­ter have reg­is­tered since its re­sump­tion. we’ll leave it to the last mo­ment to see how they go but (there are) ques­tions marks,” Rodgers said.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously we’re with­out Caglar, which is a big blow for us.</p>
    <p>“But we’ll ad­just and adapt and pre­pare a team to get a re­sult on Thurs­day.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Sh­effield United man­ager Chris Wilder has said that his side will not be dis­tracted by talk of se­cur­ing a top-four fin­ish, with their at­ten­tion fo­cused solely on to­day’s match.</p>
    <p>The Blades are sev­enth in the stand­ings with 54 points. They have picked up 10 points from their last four games with vic­to­ries against Chelsea, sixth-placed</p>
    <p>Wolver­hamp­ton Wan­der­ers and eighth-placed Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur. They also drew with Burn­ley.</p>
    <p>“We are not look­ing at any­thing but the next game, which is one we go into in good spir­its and good nick,” Wilder told re­porters in a vir­tual news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“We’re pos­i­tive shouldn’t we be?</p>
    <p>“We’ve got to make sure per­for­mances are right up there with the ones that got us re­sults against Chelsea, Wolves and Spurs.” and why</p>
