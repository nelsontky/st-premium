    <p>With i ssues re­lated to safe sport thrust into the spot­light in re­cent times, na­tional sports agency Sport Sin­ga­pore (SportSG) has ramped up its ef­forts to cre­ate a safe sport­ing en­vi­ron­ment for ath­letes.</p>
    <p>It is aim­ing to have at least one trained safe­guard­ing of­fi­cer in each na­tional sports as­so­ci­a­tion (NSA) by the end of this year, and dou­ble this num­ber by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>The Safe Sport Com­mis­sion was launched last year to clamp down on ha­rass­ment and mis­con­duct against ath­letes. Over 150 safe­guard­ing of­fi­cers have been trained and of the 64 NSAs, fewer than 10 are yet to ap­point a safe­guard­ing of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>Rais­ing aware­ness about abu­sive prac­tices is also a key pil­lar in SportSG’s ap­proach to safe­guard­ing sport.</p>
    <p>Head of CoachSG Azhar Yu­sof, who also over­sees the Safe Sport Task­force, said that more safe sport on­line mod­ules for stake­hold­ers in the fra­ter­nity will be rolled out in the com­ing months. Coaches will also be taught about “ac­cept­able prac­tices” and how to iden­tify signs and red flags.</p>
    <p>Azhar ac­knowl­edged that coaches are in­stru­men­tal in cre­at­ing a safe en­vi­ron­ment for ath­letes, adding that “nec­es­sary ac­tion” will be taken against those who vi­o­late the code of ethics.</p>
    <p>Pun­ish­ments vary ac­cord­ing to the sever­ity of each case and will be de­cided based on two fac­tors: con­se­quence and cul­pa­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>If an al­le­ga­tion arises, CoachSG will con­duct an ini­tial in­ves­ti­ga­tion and a dis­ci­plinary panel may be con­vened to hear the case “if there are suf­fi­cient grounds”, be­fore the pun­ish­ment is meted out, said Azhar, a former na­tional rugby player.</p>
    <p>This will run con­cur­rently with po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions if a re­port has been made.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tions or a court’s fi­nal de­ci­sion, the dis­ci­plinary panel may re­con­vene to de­cide if ad­di­tional or more se­vere pun­ish­ments such as ter­mi­na­tion or a life ban should be meted out.</p>
