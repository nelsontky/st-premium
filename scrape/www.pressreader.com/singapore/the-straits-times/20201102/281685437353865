    <p>PARIS • Some small shops and ser­vices, in­clud­ing a dog groom­ing sa­lon, re­mained open in a small town out­side Paris with sup­port from their lo­cal mayor, amid signs of spo­radic push­back against a new coron­avirus lock­down in France.</p>
    <p>In Paris, Mayor Anne Hidalgo joined a grow­ing wave of sup­port for in­de­pen­dent book­sellers, say­ing in an in­ter­view pub­lished yes­ter­day she would bring in lo­cal au­tho­ri­sa­tions for them to re­main open.</p>
    <p>The French gov­ern­ment put in place fresh re­stric­tions last Fri­day to com­bat a resur­gence in Covid-19 in­fec­tions and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions, echo­ing a two-month shut­down ear­lier this year. This time, schools will re­main open, but all non-es­sen­tial stores are sup­posed to close.</p>
    <p>In the small town of Yer­res, shops such as shoe sell­ers re­mained open un­der a lo­cal edict.</p>
    <p>“I think you’re tak­ing much less risk go­ing to buy your book or your shoes or your clothes in a small shop where there aren’t many peo­ple than in a big su­per­store,” Mayor Olivier Clodong said, adding he found it un­fair that hy­per­mar­kets, which sell food, could stay open.</p>
    <p>Po­lice paid a visit to a groom­ing par­lour in Yer­res where a dog was be­ing sham­pooed, but they did not is­sue an on-the-spot fine. The au­thor­i­ties have said they will be tol­er­ant at the start of the lock­down, which be­gan on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>About 20 other may­ors brought in sim­i­lar mea­sures in other parts of France on Satur­day, TV net­work BFM TV said.</p>
    <p>The re­volt has par­tic­u­larly cen­tred on book­sellers.</p>
    <p>“Along with other ci­ties, we will take a joint ini­tia­tive, fol­low­ing the one taken al­ready in Di­jon, to al­low in­de­pen­dent book­stores to re­open,” Ms Hidalgo, the Paris Mayor, told the Jour­nal du Di­manche (JDD) news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>She also called on the gov­ern­ment to al­low mu­se­ums to stay open, with rig­or­ous san­i­tary pro­to­cols and caps on vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>A book­store in Yer­res, as well as many in cen­tral Paris, tried to re­main open by op­er­at­ing “click and col­lect” ser­vices that al­low peo­ple to pick up books or­dered on­line or on the phone at the door.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with the JDD, Ju­nior Econ­omy Min­is­ter Olivier Dus­sopt said the gov­ern­ment – which is rolling out sup­port for busi­nesses in­clud­ing re­duced wel­fare bills and par­tial un­em­ploy­ment schemes – would stick to its plan to re­assess the sit­u­a­tion for re­tail­ers in two weeks’ time.</p>
    <p>“The edicts brought in by the may­ors are il­le­gal and they know it,” Mr Dus­sopt said.</p>
