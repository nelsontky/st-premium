    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON Repub­li­cans and Democrats have of­fered sharply di­ver­gent ar­gu­ments in a Supreme Court con­fir­ma­tion fight whose out­come is likely to steer the court to the right for years, vy­ing to de­fine Judge Amy Coney Bar­rett and frame the po­lit­i­cal stakes of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s rush to in­stall her be­fore he faces vot­ers.</p>
    <p>In a marathon day of open­ing state­ments, Democrats on Mon­day as­sailed Ms Bar­rett as a con­ser­va­tive ide­o­logue who would over­turn the Af­ford­able Care Act and abor­tion rights, and whose nom­i­na­tion amounted to an il­le­git­i­mate power grab by a pres­i­dent in the last days be­fore the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­cans steered clear of ad­dress­ing her an­tic­i­pated ef­fect on the court, in­stead pro­mot­ing her ster­ling qual­i­fi­ca­tions and ac­cus­ing Democrats of un­justly at­tack­ing her be­cause of her Catholic faith.</p>
    <p>Ms Bar­rett, a for­mer Notre Dame law pro­fes­sor, ap­peals court judge and mother of seven, sat in si­lence for much of the day, her ex­pres­sions ren­dered un­read­able by a black mask she had donned in ac­cor</p>
    <p>dance with the Se­nate Ju­di­ciary Com­mit­tee’s coro­n­avirus pro­to­col.</p>
    <p>When she spoke, she tried to avoid be­ing pulled into the po­lit­i­cal or pol­icy fray. “Courts are not de­signed to solve ev­ery prob­lem or right ev­ery wrong in our pub­lic</p>
    <p>life,” she said. “The pol­icy de­ci­sions and value judg­ments of gov­ern­ment must be made by the po­lit­i­cal branches elected by and ac­count­able to the peo­ple. The pub­lic should not ex­pect courts to do so, and courts should not try.”</p>
    <p>The two par­ties’ du­elling ap­proaches re­flected how con­fir­ma­tion hearings – a com­bustible en­deav­our in nor­mal times – are be­ing shaped and charged by the loom­ing elec­tion.</p>
    <p>With Repub­li­cans con­fi­dent they had the votes to con­firm Ms Bar­rett and ce­ment a last­ing 6-3 con­ser­va­tive ma­jor­ity on the Supreme Court, they sought to en­er­gise their base by por­tray­ing Democrats’ op­po­si­tion to Ms Bar­rett as anti-re­li­gion while re­as­sur­ing wary mod­er­ates by high­light­ing her sta­tus as a work­ing mother who had risen to the high­est ech­e­lons of the law.</p>
    <p>“This is prob­a­bly not about per­suad­ing each other un­less some­thing re­ally dra­matic hap­pens,” Se­na­tor Lind­sey Gra­ham, the com­mit­tee’s chair­man, said as he opened the hear­ing. “All the Repub­li­cans will vote yes; all the Democrats will vote no.”</p>
    <p>Repub­li­cans were so con­fi­dent they said they would ex­pe­dite an al­ready ac­cel­er­ated un­der­tak­ing by start­ing the process of vot­ing in the Ju­di­ciary Com­mit­tee to­mor­row morn­ing, be­fore the fi­nal day of con­fir­ma­tion hearings wraps up.</p>
    <p>Democrats, re­turn­ing to the is­sue that helped them win con­trol of the House in the 2018 midterm polls, fo­cused on what Ms Bar­rett’s con­fir­ma­tion could mean for the health care law, which Mr Trump and Repub­li­cans have pressed to re­peal. They filled the hear­ing room with large posters of Amer­i­cans who had ben­e­fited from the Af­ford­able Care Act, in­clud­ing its pro­tec­tions for pre-ex­ist­ing med­i­cal con­di­tions, and of­fered anec­dotes to il­lus­trate what vot­ers had to lose should it be in­val­i­dated, as the Mr Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion is ar­gu­ing it should be.</p>
    <p>“The truth is, Amer­ica, that this ju­di­cial nom­i­nee has made her view so clear, and this pres­i­dent is try­ing to put her in a po­si­tion of power to make de­ci­sions about your lives,” said Se­na­tor Amy Klobuchar. “The Af­ford­able Care Act pro­tects you from get­ting kicked off of your in­sur­ance. That is on the line.”</p>
    <p>Ms Bar­rett, ap­pear­ing i n the room with six of her chil­dren and hus­band, stressed her im­par­tial­ity and per­sonal story. Amer­i­cans “de­serve an i nde­pen­dent Supreme</p>
    <p>Court”, she said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>At 48, she could sit on the court for decades, with the po­ten­tial to bol­ster a con­ser­va­tive ma­jor­ity that could have broad ef­fects on Amer­i­can life, in­clud­ing civil rights, the pow­ers of busi­nesses, the abil­ity of the gov­ern­ment to reg­u­late them and myr­iad other is­sues. For all the par­ti­san ran­cour, sen­a­tors raised no doubts about her cre­den­tials.</p>
    <p>The hear­ing, play­ing out dur­ing a pan­demic that has killed nearly 215,000 Amer­i­cans, was his­toric in other ways. It was the first Supreme Court hear­ing to fea­ture video­con­fer­enc­ing, with sen­a­tors, in­clud­ing Se­na­tor Kamala Harris – a Demo­cratic nom­i­nee for vice-pres­i­dent – par­tic­i­pat­ing re­motely and un­der­scor­ing the risk of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Democrats sought to cap­i­talise on the jux­ta­po­si­tion, rag­ing against Repub­li­cans’ in­sis­tence on hold­ing a hear­ing in the mid­dle of a deadly pan­demic that has sick­ened the Pres­i­dent and at least two Repub­li­can mem­bers of the com­mit­tee af­ter a White House event Mr Trump held last month to pre­sent Ms Bar­rett as his nom­i­nee.</p>
