    <p>From June to Au­gust this year, 14 peo­ple were charged with sell­ing elec­tronic va­por­is­ers (e-va­por­is­ers) and re­lated items in Sin­ga­pore. More than $50,000 worth of goods were seized from them, and they were fined a com­bined to­tal of $255,500.</p>
    <p>All 14 cases were un­re­lated.</p>
    <p>The youngest of­fender, aged 20, was sentenced to 15-month su­per­vised pro­ba­tion, while the rest were fined be­tween $5,500 and $47,500.</p>
    <p>The of­fend­ers, aged be­tween 20 and 43, bought e-va­por­is­ers and re­lated ac­ces­sories from sup­pli­ers over­seas and sold them il­le­gally on so­cial me­dia and e-com­merce plat­forms, said the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity (HSA) in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>E-va­por­is­ers, which in­clude eci­garettes and e-cigars, are bat­tery-pow­ered de­vices that heat a liq­uid con­tain­ing nico­tine to pro­duce a vapour which is then in­haled.</p>
    <p>HSA said the of­fend­ers were caught as part of its cy­ber surveil­lance and en­force­ment ac­tiv­i­ties against the il­le­gal im­port and sale of e-va­por­is­ers and re­lated ac­ces­sories in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Since 2018, HSA has pros­e­cuted 35 peo­ple for sell­ing e-va­por­is­ers and re­lated ac­ces­sories. The heav­i­est penalty so far was a fine of $99,000 last year handed to a man for op­er­at­ing an on­line busi­ness ad­ver­tis­ing and sell­ing e-va­por­is­ers.</p>
    <p>It is an of­fence un­der the To­bacco Act to sell, of­fer for sale, pos­sess for sale, im­port or dis­trib­ute evap­or­is­ers. Of­fend­ers face a fine of up to $10,000, up to six months’ jail, or both for the first of­fence.</p>
    <p>Re­peat of­fend­ers can be fined up to $20,000, jailed for up to 12 months, or both.</p>
    <p>It is also an of­fence to pos­sess, pur­chase or use e-va­por­is­ers and re­lated ac­ces­sories. The penalty is a fine of up to $2,000.</p>
