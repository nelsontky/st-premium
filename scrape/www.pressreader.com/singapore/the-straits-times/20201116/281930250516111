    <p>We re­fer to the let­ter by Mr Wong Hong Meng (Lax safety man­age­ment at car in­spec­tion cen­tre wor­ry­ing, Nov 13).</p>
    <p>Since the start of the pandemic, we have placed SafeEn­try QR codes and hand sani­tis­ers at all our cus­tomer-fac­ing touch­points. These in­clude the self-ser­vice pay­ment kiosks, cashier coun­ters, as well as the end of ev­ery in­spec­tion lane.</p>
    <p>There are also clear mark­ings set 1m apart for mo­torists queue­ing at the self-ser­vice pay­ment kiosks and cashier coun­ters.</p>
    <p>Al­though tem­per­a­ture tak­ing is not a re­quire­ment for a non-air-con­di­tioned fa­cil­ity like our cen­tre, all our staff, in­clud­ing in­spec­tors, have their tem­per­a­tures checked twice daily.</p>
    <p>They are also re­quired to don masks at all times. They do not wear gloves but are re­quired to sani­tise their hands reg­u­larly.</p>
    <p>As the in­spec­tion process takes no more than 15 min­utes, ve­hi­cles are not wiped down after in­spec­tion.</p>
    <p>We have also taken into con­sid­er­a­tion that some car own­ers may be par­tic­u­lar about the use of dis­in­fec­tant on their ve­hi­cle’s up­hol­stery.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers who wish to wipe down their cars after each in­spec­tion are wel­come to do so at any of the avail­able park­ing spa­ces in the fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>We have re­minded and will con­tinue to re­mind all our in­spec­tors and staff to re­main vig­i­lant in en­sur­ing all cus­tomers scan the SafeEn­try QR code and main­tain safe dis­tances while queue­ing.</p>
    <p>We thank Mr Wong for shar­ing his con­cerns on the wait and his ob­ser­va­tions at the in­spec­tion cen­tre. We will con­tinue to do the best we can in up­keep­ing our safe man­age­ment mea­sures and high in­spec­tion stan­dards.</p>
