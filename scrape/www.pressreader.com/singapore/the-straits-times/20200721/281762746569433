    <p>BRUS­SELS • Euro­pean Union heavy­weight Ger­many said yes­ter­day that na­tional lead­ers split over a mas­sive coro­n­avirus stim­u­lus plan had sketched a frame­work agree­ment that could bring a suc­cess­ful end to a fraught sum­mit that has dragged i nto its fourth day.</p>
    <p>Slow to co­or­di­nate their ini­tial re­sponse to the out­break and al­ready weak­ened by Bri­tain’s de­par­ture, the EU’s 27 na­tions could re­deem them­selves with an eco­nomic aid plan that would show Euro­peans they can step up to a cri­sis and are united.</p>
    <p>But old griev­ances between fis­cally fru­gal north­ern na­tions less af­fected by the pan­demic and more in­debted south­ern Euro­pean na­tions such as Italy and Greece, whose economies are in free fall, have made progress painfully slow.</p>
    <p>Ahead of the re­sump­tion of talks yes­ter­day, Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel said lead­ers now have a new ba­sis for a deal on a €750 bil­lion (S$1.2 tril­lion) re­cov­ery fund and the bloc’s next 2021-2027 com­mon bud­get, worth around €1.1 tril­lion.</p>
    <p>“We worked out a frame­work for a pos­si­ble agree­ment last night af­ter long ne­go­ti­a­tions,” Dr Merkel told re­porters yes­ter­day, ar­riv­ing for the fourth day of talks in Brus­sels in what could be the bloc’s long­est sum­mit. “This is progress and gives hope that an agree­ment can be reached to­day.”</p>
    <p>Euro­pean Com­mis­sion pres­i­dent Ur­sula von der Leyen was also up­beat about a deal.</p>
    <p>With talks go­ing past mid­night for t wo con­sec­u­tive nights, French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron lost pa­tience in the early hours yes­ter­day and banged his fist on the table in frus­tra­tion at “ster­ile blockages” by the Nether­lands, Swe­den, Den­mark and Aus­tria, two diplo­mats said.</p>
    <p>But by day­light, he shared Dr Merkel’s op­ti­mism, telling re­porters: “I’m start­ing to­day with a lot of de­ter­mi­na­tion to make progress.”</p>
    <p>Hopes for a deal sent Italy’s bor­row­ing costs to their low­est since early March and pushed the euro to a 19-week high.</p>
    <p>Sum­mit chair­man Charles Michel had urged lead­ers on Sun­day to achieve “mis­sion im­pos­si­ble”, re­mind­ing them that more than 600,000 peo­ple have died from Covid-19 around the world.</p>
    <p>“It looks a bit more hope­ful than at the times where I thought last night that it was over,” Dutch Prime Min­is­ter Mark Rutte told re­porters in the early hours.</p>
    <p>Within the €750 bil­lion re­cov­ery fund, €390 bil­lion could be con­sid­ered as non-re­payable grants, diplo­mats said, a com­pro­mise between the €350 bil­lion level of the five “fru­gals” – which also in­clude Fin­land – and the €400 bil­lion de­manded by France and Ger­many.</p>
    <p>Aus­trian Chan­cel­lor Se­bas­tian Kurz said he was sat­is­fied with the ne­go­ti­a­tions and the form­ing of an in­for­mal group of “fru­gals”.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese are all small coun­tries, which alone would have no weight at all,” he said.</p>
    <p>Is­sues over ty­ing pay­outs to eco­nomic and demo­cratic re­forms were still to be re­solved, though Spain had sig­nalled will­ing­ness to put up with some con­di­tions be­ing at­tached to aid.</p>
    <p>“We don’t re­ject con­di­tion­al­ity,” said Spain’s For­eign Min­is­ter Aran­cha Gon­za­lez Laya. “We need a ba­sis that gives con­fi­dence to us and to our part­ners.”</p>
    <p>Euro­pean Cen­tral Bank (ECB) pres­i­dent Christine La­garde cau­tioned against a quick deal at any cost. “Ide­ally, the lead­ers’ agree­ment should be am­bi­tious i n terms of size and com­po­si­tion of the pack­age... even if it takes a bit more time,” she said.</p>
    <p>Her com­ments sug­gested she was re­laxed about any ad­verse re­ac­tion on fi­nan­cial mar­kets if the sum­mit fails, espe­cially as the ECB has a €1 tril­lion war chest to buy up gov­ern­ment debt.</p>
