    <p>LUMPUR Bad­minton’s show­piece Thomas and Uber Cups were post­poned yes­ter­day after a string of coun­tries with­drew over coro­n­avirus fears, of­fi­cials said, in a ma­jor blow to the sport’s restart.</p>
    <p>The men’s and women’s world team cham­pi­onships were set to take place in Den­mark next month, and would have been the first in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tion since the pan­demic halted the sport in March.</p>
    <p>But the Bad­minton World Fed­er­a­tion (BWF) said it had taken the “tough de­ci­sion” as the pullouts meant there would not be a high enough level of com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>No new dates were an­nounced for the two tour­na­ments, which have been post­poned three times, but the BWF con­firmed these would not take place be­fore next year.</p>
    <p>“These are ex­cep­tional cir­cum­stances we find our­selves in and while a re­turn to in­ter­na­tional bad­minton re­mains a pri­or­ity for the BWF, the health and safety of the en­tire bad­minton com­mu­nity is of ut­most im­por­tance,” said the BWF in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>A fur­ther de­lay to the tour­na­ments, which had been sched­uled to take place in Aarhus from Oct 3-11, had looked in­evitable in re­cent days after some of Asia’s top teams – In­done­sia, Chi­nese Taipei, Thai­land and South Korea – as well as Aus­tralia de­cided to with­draw from the event.</p>
    <p>Lead­ing In­dian player Saina Ne­hwal, who had been due to play in the Uber Cup, ques­tioned if push­ing ahead was a good idea, while the Olympic Coun­cil of Malaysia also called for a post­pone­ment.</p>
    <p>The de­lay is a ma­jor set­back to ef­forts to re­sume in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tion, as the team events were the big­gest left on the cal­en­dar this year after the 2020 Olympics were post­poned.</p>
    <p>It also means that play­ers face a packed cal­en­dar next year, po­ten­tially with four ma­jor tour­na­ments, in­clud­ing the Tokyo Games, the world cham­pi­onships and the world mixed team Sudirman Cup.</p>
    <p>For­mer world No. 1 Lee Chong Wei, who re­tired last year after a can­cer bat­tle, said the num­ber was “way too many”.</p>
    <p>“I can fore­see many coun­tries com­plain­ing to the BWF about the hec­tic sched­ule,” the Malaysian told The Star.</p>
    <p>“If I’m still play­ing, I would want to play well in all four events, but there’s no way you’ll be able to pre­pare and peak in all.”</p>
    <p>Two other t our­na­ments had been due to take place in Den­mark next month.</p>
    <p>The Den­mark Open will pro­ceed in Odense from Oct 13-18 as planned, but the Den­mark Masters (Oct 20-25) in the same city will be axed, the BWF added.</p>
