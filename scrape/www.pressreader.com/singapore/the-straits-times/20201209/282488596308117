    <p>• In what may be the big­gest ac­qui­si­tion ever of the mu­sic pub­lish­ing rights of a sin­gle song­writer, Uni­ver­sal Mu­sic Pub­lish­ing Group an­nounced on Mon­day that it had signed a land­mark deal to pur­chase Bob Dy­lan’s en­tire song­writ­ing catalogue – in­clud­ing world-chang­ing clas­sics like Blowin’ In The Wind, The Times They Are A-Changin’ and Like A Rolling Stone.</p>
    <p>The deal, which cov­ers the Amer­i­can singer-song­writer’s en­tire ca­reer, from his ear­li­est tunes to his lat­est al­bum, Rough And Rowdy Ways, was struck di­rectly with Dy­lan, 79, who has long con­trolled the vast ma­jor­ity of his own song­writ­ing copy­rights.</p>
    <p>The price was not dis­closed but is es­ti­mated at more than US$300 mil­lion (S$401 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>“It’s no se­cret that the art of song­writ­ing is the fun­da­men­tal key to all great mu­sic nor is it a se­cret that</p>
    <p>Bob is one of the very great­est prac­ti­tion­ers of that art,” said Mr Lu­cian Grainge, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Uni­ver­sal Mu­sic Group.</p>
    <p>The deal is the lat­est and most high-pro­file in this year’s buzzing mar­ket for mu­sic cat­a­logues, as artists both young and old have sold their songs, while pub­lish­ers and in­vestors have raised bil­lions of dol­lars from both pub­lic and pri­vate sources to per­suade writ­ers to part with their cre­ations.</p>
    <p>Dy­lan’s catalogue, though, is a spe­cial gem, revered in a way that per­haps no other pop­u­lar mu­si­cian has achieved.</p>
    <p>His trove of songs has re­shaped folk, rock and pop, and he main­tains an al­most mythic sta­tus as the bard of the cur­rent age.</p>
    <p>He was awarded the No­bel Prize in Lit­er­a­ture in 2016 “for hav­ing cre­ated new po­etic ex­pres­sions within the great Amer­i­can song tra­di­tion”.</p>
    <p>Yet to a de­gree that still sur­prises and shocks his au­di­ence, Dy­lan has long been ag­gres­sive about mar­ket­ing his mu­sic, in­clud­ing pur­su­ing li­cens­ing deals to place his songs in tele­vi­sion com­mer­cials.</p>
    <p>Since Uni­ver­sal now con­trols his work, he will no longer have veto power over how his songs will be used.</p>
    <p>Still, Uni­ver­sal in­sisted it would be taste­ful in its use of his work.</p>
    <p>Dy­lan’s deal in­cludes 100 per cent of his rights for all the songs of his catalogue, in­clud­ing both the in­come he re­ceives as a song­writer and his con­trol of each song’s copy­right.</p>
    <p>In ex­change for its pay­ment to Dy­lan, Uni­ver­sal, a di­vi­sion of French me­dia con­glom­er­ate Vivendi, will col­lect all fu­ture in­come from the songs.</p>
    <p>The deal in­cludes more than 600 songs spread across a num­ber of pub­lish­ing com­pa­nies that Dy­lan has had over the years.</p>
    <p>With the ex­cep­tion of his orig­i­nal Leeds Mu­sic deal – which in­cluded seven songs, among them Song For Woody and Talkin’ New York – he even­tu­ally took full con­trol of all his copy­rights from those cat­a­logues. Leeds was sold in 1964 to MCA, which be­came Uni­ver­sal.</p>
    <p>But the agree­ment does not in­clude any of Dy­lan’s un­re­leased songs. It also does not cover any work he writes in the fu­ture.</p>
