    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Com­mu­ni­ca­tion needs to be short and sweet – so be quick and to the point. Make sure your writ­ing is cut back as much as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>This is not a good day for long-term plans. That is not to say you can­not think about the fu­ture, just that you should not com­mit to any­thing ma­jor.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>You are in mo­tion and should find it eas­ier than usual to ad­just your per­cep­tions to ac­com­mo­date new in­for­ma­tion or cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Things are too com­pli­cated and it is not just you. Most peo­ple are hav­ing a hard time cop­ing with all the lit­tle de­tails.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You are feel­ing a sense of ac­com­plish­ment as you check out the peo­ple around you – and you are right to be im­pressed.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You need to be coldly log­i­cal. It is one of those days when get­ting it right is more im­por­tant than get­ting ev­ery­one’s in­put.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>It is time for you to move be­yond tra­di­tion and try for some­thing wild and new. It could be as sim­ple as tak­ing a dif­fer­ent route home from work.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Work-re­lated projects and ne­go­ti­a­tions are fraught with peril, but all you have to do is be care­ful to come out ahead. Do not jump into any­thing.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>You are thought­ful, but in­ter­rup­tions keep you from get­ting any­where. There is noth­ing wrong with that – the jour­ney is much more im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You have more to say than you would have ex­pected, so make sure you speak up. If no one gives you the chance, go ahead and in­ter­rupt.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Your amaz­ing mind is filled with creative en­ergy, so make sure you are us­ing it. Bust out with some new ideas at work.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Even if you have just one thing go­ing on, it feels like it is swal­low­ing your life. Take a deep breath and keep work­ing.</p>
