    <p>Chil­dren’s an­i­mated se­ries Shark­dog is about a half-shark, half-dog crea­ture and its owner Max. Cre­ated and co-di­rected by Sin­ga­porean sto­ry­board artist Jacinth Tan (be­low), it is set to air next year on Net­flix. The ti­tle char­ac­ter takes many of its doggy traits from her child­hood pet, a Shet­land sheep­dog, while its wild shark streak is in­spired by her love of mon­ster movies.</p>
    <p>What do you get when you put a Shet­land sheep­dog, mon­ster movies and a Sin­ga­porean mil­len­nial to­gether? Chil­dren’s an­i­mated se­ries Shark­dog.</p>
    <p>Set to air next year on Net­flix, the show is about a half-shark, half-dog crea­ture and its owner Max, and is cre­ated and co-di­rected by Sin­ga­porean sto­ry­board artist Jacinth Tan.</p>
    <p>Her ti­tle char­ac­ter takes many of its doggy traits – such as be­ing obe­di­ent and ea­ger to please – from her child­hood pet, a Shet­land sheep­dog, while its wild shark streak is in­spired by her love of mon­ster movies.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old says in a video in­ter­view with The Straits Times: “My dog was snug­gling with me when I was watch­ing a shark pro­gramme and I was like, ‘ Shark? Dog? Why not put these two to­gether?’</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, I’ve never had a pet shark, but I love mon­ster movies. I watch them all – from the good ones like Jaws (1975) and the Godzilla se­ries to bad B-grade films. I love all the movie tropes, so there are some shark traits that are from these mon­ster movies.”</p>
    <p>Tan, who stud­ied an­i­ma­tion at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s School of Art, De­sign and Me­dia, started on Shark­dog in 2015 and en­tered the project in Nick­elodeon’s Global An­i­mated Shorts Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Shark­dog was green-lit by the chil­dren’s chan­nel for a 20-episode, 90-sec­ond show and be­came its first an­i­mated short-form se­ries from Asia in 2018.</p>
    <p>It is slated to re­turn on Net­flix in an ex­panded form, with 20 sev­en­minute episodes.</p>
    <p>The se­ries is pro­duced by Vi­a­comCBS In­ter­na­tional Stu­dios, in part­ner­ship with Tan’s em­ployer, Sin­ga­pore-based CGI an­i­ma­tion stu­dio One An­i­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Tan says: “The 90-sec­ond se­ries was told mainly from Shark­dog’s point of view, sort of like a day in the life of Shark­dog. But with the longer run-time, we have the lux­ury of putting in big­ger sto­ries. We’re ex­pand­ing the world with new char­ac­ters, po­ten­tially new vil­lains and new lo­ca­tions.”</p>
    <p>She hopes the new se­ries will not only in­stil pas­sion and a sense of ad­ven­ture in chil­dren, but also fight stereo­types and ex­plore deeper themes.</p>
    <p>“We try to make Max’s mum a ca­reer woman who is not just a house­wife and have his dad be some­one who is very good with kids,” ex­plains Tan, who adds that the over­ar­ch­ing theme is “man ver­sus na­ture”.</p>
    <p>“Can Man re­ally con­quer and dom­i­nate na­ture? Shark­dog’s do­mes­ti­cated dog part is al­ways at odds with its fierce shark side.”</p>
    <p>While Shark­dog has been a suc­cess, Tan’s par­ents – both soft­ware en­gi­neers – were ini­tially wor­ried when she wanted to pur­sue an­i­ma­tion, which she says was un­der­stand­able.</p>
    <p>“You don’t just wake up and de­cide with cer­tainty you want to be an an­i­ma­tor. It takes some time,” she adds. “Ten years ago, I liked doo­dling and draw­ing cute fig­ures in­stead of study­ing Chi­nese or math­e­mat­ics, so of course my par­ents wor­ried that I was not sure about my path.”</p>
    <p>Hope­fully, she says, with the help of a stream­ing gi­ant like Net­flix, her se­ries will gain trac­tion over­seas and give an­i­ma­tors in the re­gion a boost.</p>
    <p>“More chil­dren around the world will be able to watch Shark­dog, a cre­ation from Sin­ga­pore,” she adds.</p>
    <p>“I hope this helps other cre­ators see that Sin­ga­porean sto­ries can be recog­nised.”</p>
