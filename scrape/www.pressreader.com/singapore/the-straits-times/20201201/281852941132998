    <p>• The an­nual de­ci­sion over who will steer the United Na­tions’ top hu­man rights or­gan­i­sa­tion is usu­ally made qui­etly and by con­sen­sus.</p>
    <p>For months, this year’s se­lec­tion seemed to fol­low that script, un­til an un­ex­pected con­test emerged over the 2021 pres­i­dency of the or­gan­i­sa­tion, the UN Hu­man Rights Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>The po­si­tion ro­tates by re­gion and is due to be filled next year by a mem­ber of the Asian-Pa­cific bloc of coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The dis­pute over the coun­cil pres­i­dency is pit­ting some of the world body’s most pow­er­ful mem­ber states against tiny Pa­cific Is­land na­tions and is play­ing out as UN mem­bers jockey for in­flu­ence in an­tic­i­pa­tion of a new, more en­gaged ad­min­is­tra­tion in the United States.</p>
    <p>For months, the only an­nounced can­di­date to lead the coun­cil next year was Fiji’s UN am­bas­sador, Ms Nazhat Shameem Khan.</p>
    <p>But three days be­fore the dead­line for ap­pli­ca­tions, an­other mem­ber of the re­gional bloc, Bahrain, tossed its hat in the ring and told Fiji to step aside.</p>
    <p>Geneva-based diplo­mats in­ter­pret op­po­si­tion to Fiji’s can­di­dacy as an ef­fort by China, Rus­sia and Saudi Ara­bia to put the coun­cil’s pres­i­dency i n the hands of a com­pli­ant state as the role of the US takes new shape un­der the in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>China, in par­tic­u­lar, has tried to take ad­van­tage of Amer­ica’s ab­sence from the coun­cil to ex­pand its in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>The is­sue has par­tic­u­lar res­o­nance as 2021 looms.</p>
    <p>West­ern gov­ern­ments hope the US will re-en­gage with the coun­cil when Mr Joe Bi­den en­ters the White House, fill­ing a vac­uum left when Mr Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion walked out on the body in 2018.</p>
    <p>They want the coun­cil to re­con­sider why Is­rael is the only na­tion treated as a stand­ing item on its agenda.</p>
    <p>They also hope to in­tro­duce tougher rules for coun­cil mem­ber­ship.</p>
    <p>A coun­cil pres­i­dent aligned with states hos­tile to re­form would be in a po­si­tion to steer the coun­cil to­wards other busi­ness, sidelin­ing Amer­i­can in­ter­ests along the way.</p>
    <p>Fiji’s Prime Min­is­ter Frank Bain­i­marama, far from back­ing down, has been con­tact­ing fel­low Pa­cific Is­land l ead­ers to rally sup­port for his coun­try’s can­di­dacy.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, the Mar­shall Is­lands said it would re­ject any can­di­date but Fiji.</p>
    <p>Qatar, which is at odds with Saudi Ara­bia, said it would also op­pose the can­di­dacy of Bahrain and its am­bas­sador, Mr Yusuf Ab­dulka­rim Bucheeri.</p>
    <p>That could set the stage for a vote by the bloc in the com­ing weeks.</p>
