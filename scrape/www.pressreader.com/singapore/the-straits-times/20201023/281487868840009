    <p>A run­ning coach duped nearly 40 peo­ple of more than $100,000, sell­ing them false tour pack­ages for over­seas marathon trips or non-ex­is­tent Garmin watches.</p>
    <p>Tan Swee Tiong, 48, also known as Lexxus Tan, is the founder of pop­u­lar run­ning club F1 Run­ners and had cheated club mem­bers to feed his gambling addiction.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, he was sen­tenced to one year and five months’ jail after plead­ing guilty to a charge of cheat­ing.</p>
    <p>A sim­i­lar charge was taken into con­sid­er­a­tion dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>The court heard that the scams hap­pened be­tween Fe­bru­ary 2017 and June 2018.</p>
    <p>Tan earned his i ncome from coach­ing fees that he col­lected from mem­bers when they signed up for mem­ber­ships, with the fees rang­ing from $300 to $1,090.</p>
    <p>He later hatched a scheme to or­gan­ise “run­ca­tions”, which were over­seas trips to take part in marathons, such as to Ber­lin and Osaka, Deputy Public Prose­cu­tor (DPP) Stephanie Chew told the court.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, the ac­cused did not in­tend to ful­fil any of his prom­ises, and in­stead used this ruse to de­ceive var­i­ous in­di­vid­u­als into trans­fer­ring monies to him, which he then used for gambling,” DPP Chew said.</p>
    <p>Tan cheated 39 in­di­vid­u­als out of a to­tal of $89,616 with his tour of­fers.</p>
    <p>Separately, he also cheated 10 peo­ple of a to­tal of $10,950 into buy­ing non-ex­is­tent Garmin watches.</p>
    <p>The prose­cu­tor said Tan has re­turned $5,940 of the to­tal amount he re­ceived.</p>
    <p>“The ac­cused ad­mits that he spent the vast ma­jor­ity of the monies he cheated on gambling,” DPP Chew said.</p>
    <p>She pressed the court to sen­tence Tan to at least 171/ months’ jail, not</p>
    <p>2 ing that he had breached the trust placed in him by var­i­ous in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>“He had founded a rel­a­tively pop­u­lar run­ning club and was clearly trusted as a mem­ber of the com­mu­nity,” said DPP Chew in her sub­mis­sions.</p>
    <p>De­fence coun­sel Choo Si Sen said Tan was re­morse­ful, and is a “changed man” who is try­ing his best to pay back the monies owed.</p>
    <p>How­ever, District Judge Jas­ben­dar Kaur noted that Tan had made up plans to en­cour­age his vic­tims to make pay­ment to him.</p>
    <p>He will start serv­ing his sen­tence on Nov 19.</p>
    <p>FEEDING GAMBLING ADDICTION</p>
    <p>...the ac­cused did not in­tend to ful­fil any of his prom­ises, and in­stead used this ruse to de­ceive var­i­ous in­di­vid­u­als into trans­fer­ring monies to him, which he then used for gambling. ’’</p>
