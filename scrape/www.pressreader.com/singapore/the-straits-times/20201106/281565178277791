    <p>The world’s big­gest ice­berg is on a col­li­sion course with a re­mote South At­lantic is­land that is home to thou­sands of pen­guins and seals, and could im­pede their abil­ity to gather food, sci­en­tists said. Ice­bergs nat­u­rally break off from Antarc­tica, but cli­mate change has ac­cel­er­ated the process. At its cur­rent speed, it will take the gi­ant ice cube 20 to 30 days to run aground on the is­land’s shal­low wa­ters.</p>

    <p>The world’s big­gest ice­berg is on a col­li­sion course with a South At­lantic is­land that is home to thou­sands of pen­guins and seals, and could im­pede their abil­ity to gather food, sci­en­tists said.</p>
    <p>Ice­bergs nat­u­rally break off from Antarc­tica into the ocean, but cli­mate change has ac­cel­er­ated the process – in this case, with po­ten­tially dev­as­tat­ing con­se­quences for the abun­dant wildlife in the re­mote Bri­tish Over­seas Ter­ri­tory of South Ge­or­gia.</p>
    <p>The ice­berg, shaped like a closed hand with a point­ing fin­ger, is known as A68a and split off in 2017 from Larsen ice shelf on the West Antarc­tic Penin­sula, which has warmed faster than any other part of Earth’s south­ern-most con­ti­nent.</p>
    <p>At its cur­rent rate of travel, it will take the gi­ant ice cube 20 to 30 days to run aground into the is­land’s shal­low wa­ters.</p>
    <p>A68a is 160km long and 48km across at its widest point, cov­er­ing an area es­ti­mated at 4,200 sq km, or about six times the size of Sin­ga­pore. But the ice­berg is less than 200m deep, which means it could park dan­ger­ously close to the is­land.</p>
    <p>“We put the odds of col­li­sion at 50/50,” Mr Andrew Fleming from the Bri­tish Antarc­tic Sur­vey told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of King pen­guins – a species with a bright splash of yel­low on their heads – live on the is­land, along­side Mac­a­roni, Chin­strap and Gen­too pen­guins.</p>
    <p>Seals also pop­u­late South Ge­or­gia, as do wan­der­ing al­ba­trosses, the largest bird species that can fly.</p>
    <p>If the ice­berg runs aground next to South Ge­or­gia, for­ag­ing routes could be blocked, ham­per­ing the abil­ity of pen­guin par­ents to feed their young, and thus threat­en­ing the sur­vival of seal pups and pen­guin chicks.</p>
    <p>“Global num­bers of pen­guins and seals would drop by a large mar­gin,” Dr Geraint Tar­ling, also from the Bri­tish Antarc­tic Sur­vey, told AFP in an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>The in­com­ing ice­berg would also crush or­gan­isms and their seafloor ecosys­tem, which would need decades or cen­turies to re­cover.</p>
    <p>Car­bon stored by these or­gan­isms would be re­leased into the ocean and at­mos­phere, adding to car­bon emis­sions caused by hu­man ac­tiv­ity, the re­searchers said.</p>
    <p>As A68a drifted with cur­rents across the South At­lantic, the ice­berg did a great job of dis­tribut­ing mi­cro­scopic ed­i­bles for the ocean’s tini­est crea­tures, said Dr Tar­ling. “Over hun­dreds of years, this ice­berg has ac­cu­mu­lated a lot of nu­tri­ents and dust, and they are start­ing to leach out and fer­tilise the oceans.”</p>
    <p>Up to a kilo­me­tre thick, ice­bergs are the solid-ice ex­ten­sion of land­bound glaciers. They nat­u­rally break off from ice shelves as snowladen glaciers push to­wards the sea. But global warm­ing has in­creased the fre­quency of this process, known as calv­ing.</p>
    <p>“The amount of ice go­ing from the cen­tre of the Antarc­tic con­ti­nent out to­wards the edges is in­creas­ing in speed,” Dr Tar­ling said.</p>
    <p>Up to the end of the 20th cen­tury, the Larsen ice shelf had been sta­ble for more than 10,000 years.</p>
    <p>In 1995, how­ever, a huge chunk broke off, fol­lowed by an­other in 2002. This was fol­lowed by the breakup of the nearby Wilkins ice shelf in 2008 and 2009, and A68a in 2017.</p>
