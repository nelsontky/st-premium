    <p>The first time Leslie Danker set foot in Raf­fles Ho­tel, he was 18 and had just fin­ished school.</p>
    <p>He wan­dered into the Long Bar and watched be­mused as peo­ple sipped drinks of a pink hue, which he would later learn was the ho­tel’s sig­na­ture cock­tail, the Sin­ga­pore Sling. Not know­ing any bet­ter, he or­dered a draft beer, drank it and left.</p>
    <p>Lit­tle did he know then that his ex­is­tence would be so thor­oughly in­ter­twined with the ho­tel’s.</p>
    <p>Danker, 81, is the ho­tel’s res­i­dent his­to­rian and its long­est-serv­ing staff mem­ber at 48 years. Notably, he is the only em­ployee to have wit­nessed not one, but two restora­tions, from 1989 to 1991 and 2017 to last year re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Last Tues­day, he launched his sec­ond book about the ho­tel, A Life In­ter­twined, which weaves the mem­oir of his own life with lit­tle­known facts about the ho­tel, which just turned 133 years old.</p>
    <p>His first book, Mem­oirs Of A Raf­fles Orig­i­nal, was pub­lished in 2010.</p>
    <p>Mr Danker has spent much of his life in the same neigh­bour­hood as the ho­tel.</p>
    <p>The son of a Pub­lic Works De­part­ment of­fice ad­min­is­tra­tor and a house­wife, he grew up in Pe­nang Road. As a boy, he hung out with friends at the Catholic Cen­tre, watched movies at the Al­ham­bra or Marl­bor­ough The­atre and went for din­ner at the Satay Club off Beach Road, back in the day when Beach Road was ac­tu­ally near the beach.</p>
    <p>“The sea was just in front of the build­ing,” he says in the Grand Lobby, ges­tur­ing out beyond the ho­tel drive­way. “The sea was there.”</p>
    <p>He spent 15 years as a so­cial worker, but de­cided in 1972 he wanted a change. He walked up to the front desk of the Raf­fles Ho­tel and asked to speak to the man­ager about a job.</p>
    <p>To his sur­prise, he got an in­ter­view and was later hired as a main­te­nance su­per­vi­sor. He went on to work his way through the ho­tel’s var­i­ous de­part­ments, from food and bev­er­age to front of house.</p>
    <p>He has met celebrity guests such as Jackie Chan, Michael Jack­son and John Wayne, al­though his favourite re­mains Queen El­iz­a­beth II of Britain – “a gentle lady, very soft spo­ken”.</p>
    <p>His propen­sity for mak­ing dis­cov­er­ies about the ho­tel – dur­ing the first restora­tion, he found hun­dreds of pot­tery shards in an old kitchen dump, one of which bore the dis­tinc­tive crest of the ho­tel’s Ar­me­nian founders, the Sarkies brothers – led to him be­com­ing the res­i­dent his­to­rian.</p>
    <p>Mr Danker, who pos­sesses an ex­tra­or­di­nary knack for call­ing up facts and even ex­act dates from mem­ory, is de­voted to dig­ging up and pre­serv­ing records of the ho­tel’s his­tory.</p>
    <p>Some of these ap­pear as anec­dotes in A Life In­ter­twined, like the hu­mor­ous story of how in 1904, guests took their baths by scoop­ing wa­ter out of large earthen­ware con­tain­ers called Shang­hai Jars. One guest mis­took the jar for a bath­tub, tried to climb in and got stuck. His cries for help were even­tu­ally heard by a room at­ten­dant, who freed him with the aid of a hammer.</p>
    <p>Mr Danker, who is mar­ried with two daugh­ters and two grand­sons, has re­tired from the ho­tel, though he still goes in to work part-time.</p>
    <p>He notes that the ho­tel in­dus­try is go­ing through a dif­fi­cult time dur­ing the tourism drought due to Covid-19 bor­der clo­sures, but he re­mains op­ti­mistic.</p>
    <p>“In the his­tory of Raf­fles Ho­tel, there are a lot of ups and downs,” he says, cit­ing the founders’ bank­ruptcy in 1931; the Ja­panese Oc­cu­pa­tion in World War II, when Ja­panese sol­diers stayed in the ho­tel; and the rise of ri­val ho­tels in the Or­chard Road area in the 1970s.</p>
    <p>“We had so many crises, but the ho­tel still re­mains. So I al­ways say, there will al­ways be a Raf­fles.”</p>
    <p>A Life In­ter­twined ($32.90) is avail­able at Raf­fles Bou­tique and www.raf­fle­sar­cade.com.sg</p>
