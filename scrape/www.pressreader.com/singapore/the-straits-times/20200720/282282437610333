    <p>None of the new po­ten­tial white knights for be­lea­guered Hyflux has lodged res­cue of­fers for the 34,000 in­vestors of its failed per­pet­ual se­cu­ri­ties and pref­er­ence shares (PnP) who have been wait­ing for more than two years to re­coup their losses, Sin­ga­pore’s in­vestor watch­dog said.</p>
    <p>The Se­cu­ri­ties In­vestors As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore), or Sias, said last night that it “is un­able to sup­port any po­ten­tial in­vest­ments which do not con­tain a con­crete pro­posal to re­solve the debts due to the PnP share­hold­ers”.</p>
    <p>No of­fer has been put on the table by po­ten­tial in­vestors – Pi­son In­vest­ments, Uni­le­gend In­vest­ments, Aqua Munda, Longview In­ter­na­tional Hold­ings and FCC Aqualia – to re­tail PnP in­vestors, who are owed $900 mil­lion in to­tal.</p>
    <p>In­stead, Pi­son and Uni­le­gend have both stated they will not con­sider mak­ing an i nvest­ment if Hyflux founder Olivia Lum and her man­age­ment and board are re­moved, or if the com­pany goes into ju­di­cial man­age­ment or liq­ui­da­tion.</p>
    <p>This is de­spite Hyflux and its cur­rent and for­mer di­rec­tors be­ing in­ves­ti­gated over sus­pected false and mis­lead­ing claims as well as breaches of dis­clo­sure rules that may have oc­curred over sev­eral years.</p>
    <p>Pi­son is a Sin­ga­pore-in­cor­po­rated in­vest­ment ve­hi­cle for Mr</p>
    <p>Johnny Wid­jaja, an In­done­sian busi­ness­man who ex­pressed in­ter­est in in­vest­ing up to $300 mil­lion in Hyflux, while Uni­le­gend has an un­named client in­ter­ested in ex­plor­ing an in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>Two oth­ers – Sin­ga­pore-based Longview In­ter­na­tional Hold­ings and Spain-based wa­ter man­age­ment firm FCC Aqualia – pre­vi­ously ex­pressed in­ter­est in in­vest­ing.</p>
    <p>Sias pres­i­dent David Ger­ald said that while Hyflux has an­nounced that Pi­son’s of­fer is backed up by $200 mil­lion in Bank Mandiri, Pi­son has not yet ex­tended any of­fer to PnP hold­ers.</p>
    <p>And while Aqua Munda has com­mit­ted $208 mil­lion to buy the se­nior un­se­cured cred­i­tors’ debt and fund Hyflux’s cap­i­tal re­quire­ments, Sias has not re­ceived any of­fer to PnP hold­ers de­spite its rep­re­sen­ta­tives say­ing they will make one, Mr Ger­ald said.</p>
    <p>He added: “Sias urges Aqua</p>
    <p>Munda to table its of­fer to the PnP hold­ers at the ear­li­est op­por­tu­nity be­fore July 27.”</p>
    <p>On July 27, the High Court will hear ap­pli­ca­tions by an un­se­cured work­ing group (UWG) of banks and by ESR-Reit that they be carved out of Hyflux’s debt mora­to­rium, which has been ex­tended un­til July 30.</p>
    <p>If this is ap­proved, the UWG plans to file an ap­pli­ca­tion to ap­point ju­di­cial man­agers to over­see Hyflux in place of the present man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>So far, the only of­fer on the table for PnP in­vestors is from United Arab Emirates util­ity com­pany Utico, whose res­cue of­fer keeps chang­ing ev­ery few months.</p>
    <p>Its lat­est has been re­vised to a min­i­mum of $485 mil­lion, com­pris­ing cash and stock.</p>
    <p>This came after Utico in May backed off from a $400 mil­lion re­struc­tur­ing deal struck last Novem­ber and de­manded that all Hyflux cred­i­tors ac­cept shares of Utico and Hyflux as pay­ment in­stead of cash.</p>
    <p>Un­der the lat­est of­fer, the re­turn to se­nior un­se­cured cred­i­tors and the re­tail PnP in­vestors is ex­pected to be “more than 10 per cent” higher than what had been avail­able un­der the $400 mil­lion deal, Utico said.</p>
    <p>Small PnP hold­ers – those hold­ing less than $10,000 – can now ex­pect 15 per cent to 50 per cent re­cov­ery, as they will each get $1,500 or 50 per cent, which­ever is lower. Larger PnP hold­ers will see at least 10 per cent re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Utico did not spec­ify if in­vestors will get this in cash and if it will be an up­front or de­ferred pay­out.</p>
    <p>Mr Ger­ald noted that the $485 mil­lion of­fer has is­sues to be ad­dressed, namely the fact that nei­ther Hyflux nor Utico has re­leased full de­tails of the new plan to PnP hold­ers.</p>
    <p>“Un­der the re­vised of­fer, it ap­pears that the PnP hold­ers will no longer be given a choice to elect be­tween an up­front pay­ment and a de­ferred pay­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Sias is also con­cerned that the cut-off mark of $10,000 be­tween small and large PnP hold­ers is ar­bi­trary, and may be prej­u­di­cial to the large PnP hold­ers.</p>
    <p>“(They) would be forced to take Utico and Hyflux shares with­out know­ing the true value of (these) and with­out any cer­tainty that Utico would achieve list­ing sta­tus on a recog­nised stock ex­change.”</p>
    <p>De­spite re­peated Sias queries, the Hyflux board has not stated if it will ab­stain from vot­ing on the lat­est Utico of­fer and if it would give up its en­ti­tle­ment for the ben­e­fit of the PnP hold­ers.</p>
    <p>It also re­mains un­clear whether there will be a re­lease of claims against Hyflux di­rec­tors un­der the lat­est of­fer, Mr Ger­ald said.</p>
    <p>No of­fer has been put on the table by po­ten­tial in­vestors – Pi­son In­vest­ments, Uni­le­gend In­vest­ments, Aqua Munda, Longview In­ter­na­tional Hold­ings and FCC Aqualia – to re­tail PnP in­vestors, who are owed $900 mil­lion in to­tal.</p>
