    <p>A new move will see more foot­fall re­turn to Changi Air­port, which has seen pas­sen­ger num­bers dry up in the wake of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. The ad­di­tional traf­fic will come in the form of tran­sit pas­sen­gers from In­done­sia, Malaysia and Thai­land, who will now be able to tran­sit at Changi Air­port via Sin­ga­pore Air­lines Group’s flights.</p>
    <p>A small but sig­nif­i­cant step will see more foot­falls re­turn to Changi Air­port, which has seen pas­sen­ger num­bers dry up in the wake of the global pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The ad­di­tional traf­fic will come in the form of tran­sit pas­sen­gers from In­done­sia, Malaysia and Thai­land, who will now be able to tran­sit at Changi Air­port via Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) Group’s flights.</p>
    <p>This comes just a week after the Civil Avi­a­tion Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (CAAS) ap­proved SIA’s ap­pli­ca­tion to fly in tran­sit pas­sen­gers from Viet­nam and Cam­bo­dia.</p>
    <p>The five coun­tries are the first from the re­gion whose de­part­ing pas­sen­gers are al­lowed to tran­sit here after bor­der re­stric­tions to curb the spread of Covid-19 were slightly eased in June.</p>
    <p>In the last two months, SIA has also ob­tained ap­proval to fly in tran­sit pas­sen­gers from coun­tries such as Aus­tralia, China and Italy.</p>
    <p>The grad­ual open­ing up to tran­sit pas­sen­gers is an­other in a se­ries of steps taken to help Changi and SIA get on their feet again after the pan­demic wiped out demand for air travel. Air­ports and air­lines world­wide are strug­gling with the im­pact.</p>
    <p>“These are still baby steps though, but will hope­fully reignite air­craft and pas­sen­ger move­ments at the air­port,” said Mr Shukor Yu­sof of En­dau An­a­lyt­ics.</p>
    <p>The Changi air hub is seen as a cru­cial part of the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy. It had been con­tribut­ing more than 5 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct and em­ploy­ing 192,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Now, it is among the worst-hit seg­ments of the econ­omy, with the trans­porta­tion and stor­age sec­tor shrink­ing at an an­nu­alised rate of 80 per cent, in the sec­ond quar­ter of the year, com­pared with the first.</p>
    <p>The lat­est ap­proval means that the SIA Group will fly tran­sit pas­sen­gers through Sin­ga­pore from Bangkok as well as three In­done­sian cities – Jakarta, Medan and Surabaya – and four Malaysian cities – Ipoh, Kuching, Kuala Lumpur and Penang.</p>
    <p>An SIA Group spokesman said: “While this is a pos­i­tive devel­op­ment, the sit­u­a­tion none­the­less re­mains ex­tremely fluid and chal­leng­ing for the group.</p>
    <p>“The group cur­rently op­er­ates an av­er­age pas­sen­ger ca­pac­ity of about 7 per cent, as com­pared to our ca­pac­ity in Jan­uary 2020 be­fore the on­set of the Covid-19 out­break.”</p>
    <p>In­de­pen­dent avi­a­tion an­a­lyst Bren­dan So­bie from So­bie Avi­a­tion said tran­sit traf­fic from the five South-east Asian coun­tries will be lim­ited due to all the lin­ger­ing re­stric­tions on in­ter­na­tional travel.</p>
    <p>“Un­til South-east Asia can es­tab­lish mean­ing­ful travel bub­bles with each other and the rest of the world there will be lim­ited demand for tran­sit­ing Changi and Changi will not be able to re­store its former sta­tus as one of South-east Asia’s lead­ing hubs,” he said.</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung had said last week that even at its peak, trans­fer and tran­sit pas­sen­gers ac­counted for at most only a third of Changi’s pas­sen­ger traf­fic.</p>
    <p>At the mo­ment, there are only about 400 tran­sit and trans­fer pas­sen­gers pass­ing through Changi Air­port daily, which equates to about 150,000 such pas­sen­gers a year as com­pared with the preCovid-19 lev­els of al­most 20 mil­lion a year. It is not known what this num­ber will rise to, once the tran­sit flights with Sin­ga­pore’s re­gional neigh­bours start oper­at­ing.</p>
    <p>To re­vive the ail­ing lo­cal air­lines and air­port, Mr Ong sug­gested that Sin­ga­pore could con­sider in­tro­duc­ing re­cip­ro­cal green lanes at Changi Air­port for tourists from coun­tries where the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion is sim­i­lar to or better than that in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>If im­ple­mented, it would re­place the cur­rent quar­an­tine re­quire­ments with a strin­gent test­ing regime.</p>
