    <p>New Delhi, once the worst-hit city in In­dia for coro­n­avirus cases, seems to have turned a cor­ner, with the num­ber of new cases drop­ping from an av­er­age of 3,400 a day for the week be­gin­ning June 19, to a daily av­er­age of 1,430 for the seven days since July 14.</p>
    <p>A glim­mer of hope has emerged for the In­dian cap­i­tal in its fight against Covid-19, with a steady fall in daily new in­fec­tions. New cases have dropped from an av­er­age of 3,400 a day for the week be­gin­ning June 19, to a daily av­er­age of 1,430 for the seven days since July 14. Delhi, in fact, recorded its low­est daily in­crease since May 27 on Mon­day, with 954 cases.</p>
    <p>Once the worst-hit city in In­dia, it cur­rently has 15,288 ac­tive cases and 3,690 deaths. A to­tal of 106,118 peo­ple have re­cov­ered. This po­ten­tial in­flec­tion point comes on the back of ag­gres­sive test­ing that has re­sulted in a higher rate of de­tec­tion, as well as sub­se­quent iso­la­tion and treat­ment of pa­tients. Tests in</p>
    <p>Delhi in­creased al­most three­fold, from an av­er­age of about 7,110 per day dur­ing the week be­gin­ning June 12 to an av­er­age of 19,659 for the week be­gin­ning July 14.</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edg­ing that ag­gres­sive test­ing was the first step of the con­tain­ment strat­egy, Mr Akshay Marathe, a spokesman for the Aam Aadmi Party that gov­erns Delhi, told The Straits Times that the early adop­tion of home quar­an­tine for mild and asymp­to­matic cases, to­gether with pub­lic aware­ness cam­paigns ad­vo­cat­ing the prac­tice, had en­cour­aged more peo­ple to come for­ward to be tested.</p>
    <p>“There are poli­cies (in sev­eral states) that man­date com­pul­sory quar­an­tine in gov­ern­ment fa­cil­i­ties, which has been a huge, huge hurdle in get­ting peo­ple to come for­ward to ac­tu­ally get tested,” he said.</p>
    <p>More than half of the ac­tive cases in Delhi as of Tues­day were in home</p>
    <p>HUGE HURDLE</p>
    <p>There are poli­cies (in sev­eral states) that man­date com­pul­sory quar­an­tine in gov­ern­ment fa­cil­i­ties, which has been a huge, huge hurdle in get­ting peo­ple to come for­ward to ac­tu­ally get ’’ tested.</p>
    <p>MR AKSHAY MARATHE, a spokesman for the Aam Aadmi Party that gov­erns Delhi.</p>
    <p>quar­an­tine and placed un­der the reg­u­lar ob­ser­va­tion of state health work­ers.</p>
    <p>Some have ar­gued that if Delhi is able to con­sol­i­date this gain over the next few weeks and curb the spread of the coro­n­avirus, it would mean that the city has passed its peak of in­fec­tions. How­ever, con­cerns re­main around the false neg­a­tives that the rapid anti­gen test kit be­ing used, one de­vel­oped by the South Korean firm SD Biosen­sor, can lead to. Around 70 per cent of the tests in Delhi are be­ing con­ducted us­ing this kit.</p>
    <p>The In­dian Coun­cil of Med­i­cal Re­search (ICMR) had tested the kit and found that while its rate of de­tect­ing true pos­i­tives was more than 99 per cent, its abil­ity to de­tect true neg­a­tives ranged from 50.6 per cent to 84 per cent.</p>
    <p>There­fore, while grant­ing the kit ap­proval for pub­lic use, the ICMR also rec­om­mended that every case de­tected as neg­a­tive with the rapid anti­gen test kit be “def­i­nitely tested” with the “gold stan­dard” and more re­li­able re­verse tran­scrip­tion poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (RT-PCR) tech­nique.</p>
    <p>But ac­cord­ing to a re­port in The Hindu news­pa­per, only around 1,670 (about 0.5 per cent) of the 285,225 rapid tests that showed up as neg­a­tive be­tween June 18 and July 16 in Delhi were retested us­ing the RT-PCR tech­nique; 262 of them turned out to be pos­i­tive. This means that there are many asymp­to­matic pos­i­tive cases who could still be pass­ing on the in­fec­tion to oth­ers in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, more In­dian states are adopt­ing an ag­gres­sive test­ing pol­icy as the ca­pac­ity to run tests – both RT-PCR and rapid anti­gen tests – in­creases con­comi­tantly.</p>
    <p>Mum­bai, one of the worst-hit cities, opened up test­ing for every­body on July 7, ir­re­spec­tive of whether they have symp­toms or a doc­tor’s pre­scrip­tion.</p>
    <p>The ICMR’s guide­lines still re­strict test­ing to symp­to­matic in­di­vid­u­als, as well as asymp­to­matic “di­rect and high-risk” con­tacts of a con­firmed case.</p>
    <p>With more than 45,000 daily new in­fec­tions push­ing the to­tal tally to 1,238,635 cases yes­ter­day, there have been grow­ing calls for In­dia to ramp up its test­ing and for the ICMR to fur­ther re­lax its test­ing norms.</p>
