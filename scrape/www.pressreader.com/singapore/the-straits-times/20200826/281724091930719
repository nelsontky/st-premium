    <p>For­mer US am­bas­sador to Sin­ga­pore Kirk Wa­gar yes­ter­day said he has re­signed from his in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tor po­si­tion i n Ax­ing­ton, which is linked to Bel­la­graph Nova (BN) Group, the Sin­ga­pore-regis­tered com­pany that had ad­mit­ted to doc­tor­ing pho­to­graphs of its founders with for­mer United States pres­i­dent Barack Obama.</p>
    <p>He told The Straits Times: “Due to the re­cent revelation­s, I have re­signed that po­si­tion and asked for Ax­ing­ton to ad­vise Sin­ga­pore Ex­change and any other rel­e­vant par­ties of that fact.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sional ad­vi­sory ser­vices firm Ax­ing­ton’s board in­cludes Ms Evan­ge­line Shen of BN Group, which is mak­ing a bid for English Premier League club New­cas­tle United. The group is co-founded by Ms Shen, 32, and Sin­ga­porean in­vestors Nel­son Loh, 40, and Ter­ence Loh, 42.</p>
    <p>Ms Shen is the non-in­de­pen­dent non-ex­ec­u­tive chair­man of Ax­ing­ton, while the Lohs are its con­trol­ling share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Wa­gar said the Loh cousins asked him in June if he would serve on the board of an ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence/ro­bot­ics firm that they were start­ing which com­ple­mented the busi­ness of Novena Global Life­care, which is also founded by the two men.</p>
    <p>Mr Wa­gar, who said his firm was en­gaged by Novena Health­care as a se­nior ad­viser, agreed and “went through all of the hoops that the SGX re­quired”. He as­sumed the po­si­tion on July 21.</p>
    <p>In a July 29 press state­ment on PR Newswire, the BN Group said it had wel­comed Mr Wa­gar as “strate­gic ad­viser to its board of di­rec­tors”.</p>
    <p>But Mr Wa­gar told ST: “I have never had any role of any kind with BN Group and I have met Ms Shen only once at events sur­round­ing the Ed­u­ca­tion Gala last De­cem­ber.”</p>
    <p>Mr Obama was the keynote speaker at the Ed­u­ca­tion Ben­e­fit Gala or­gan­ised last De­cem­ber by Novena Global Life­care.</p>
    <p>Mr Wa­gar said: “I work very hard to show my­self as a level-headed, trans­par­ent friend of Sin­ga­pore and there is noth­ing more im­por­tant to me per­son­ally than main­tain­ing that rep­u­ta­tion.”</p>
    <p>Ax­ing­ton stock has see-sawed in the past two days, end­ing 13.6 per cent, or three cents, lower at 19 cents yes­ter­day. The Catal­ist-listed firm on July 29 pro­posed a name change to NETX, and to change its core busi­ness to pro­vid­ing med­i­cal and con­sumer well­ness ser­vices, and in­vest­ments in med­i­cal tech­nol­ogy, ro­bot­ics and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>NETX’s web­site had said AIA, DBS Bank and United Over­seas Bank, among oth­ers, were its fi­nan­cial ser­vices part­ners.</p>
    <p>But The Straits Times un­der­stands the in­surer and both banks were not aware they had been listed as part­ners of NETX.</p>
