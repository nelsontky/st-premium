    <p>Cen­tral banks are con­sid­er­ing is­su­ing their own dig­i­tal cur­rency, us­ing dis­trib­uted ledger tech­nol­ogy. How is this dif­fer­ent from bit­coin and other cryp­tocur­ren­cies is­sued by pri­vate in­sti­tu­tions? Are cen­tral bank dig­i­tal cur­ren­cies a good move? Fi­nance Pro­fes­sor Duan Jin-Chuan has the an­swers.</p>
    <p>I would con­tend that within a decade, many of us will rou­tinely deal in dig­i­tal cur­ren­cies, given the strength and in­ten­sity of the eco­nomic forces un­leashed by dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>Money, a medium of ex­change, was a ne­ces­sity-driven human in­ven­tion long be­fore the ad­vent of writ­ten his­tory. Imag­ine how in­con­ve­nient it would have been if you still had to barter for my horse with your grains.</p>
    <p>The form of money has evolved over mil­len­nia, from cowrie shells in an­cient times, to coins to ban­knotes, in re­sponse to the tech­nol­ogy of the time. It should hardly be sur­pris­ing that the ban­knotes and coins of to­day will be phased out in due course.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal cur­ren­cies have al­ready ar­rived on the scene, gen­er­at­ing much hype. Bit­coin and other cryp­tocur­ren­cies, for ex­am­ple, have at­tracted much at­ten­tion from in­vestors and risen to record prices – and sunk to dis­mal lows.</p>
    <p>But in my view, the only sus­tain­able dig­i­tal cur­ren­cies will be those that fall ex­clu­sively in the domain of dig­i­tal fiat monies – such as the Sin­ga­pore dol­lar, Chi­nese yuan, and oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Such dig­i­tal fiat cur­ren­cies will work along­side var­i­ous fa­mil­iar elec­tronic forms of fiat money like the ones in your DBS bank ac­counts or in mo­bile pay­ment de­vices like Grab.</p>
    <p>Blockchain­s or, more gen­er­ally, dis­trib­uted ledgers are the en­ablers, pro­vid­ing the tech­nol­ogy that drive such fiat cur­ren­cies – but it is eco­nomics that will de­ter­mine a dig­i­tal cur­rency’s des­tiny.</p>
    <p>My view, while per­haps provoca­tive and un­wel­com­ing, is that all cryp­tocur­ren­cies backed by ei­ther a loosely struc­tured com­mu­nity of en­thu­si­asts, say, bit­coin, or by a pri­vate en­ter­prise such as Face­book-pro­moted Li­bra, will fade away and be­come in­con­se­quen­tial in due course and be viewed by his­to­ri­ans as pass­ing hype that had once upon a time stirred up vary­ing de­grees of en­thu­si­asm.</p>
    <p>But dig­i­tal cur­ren­cies is­sued by cen­tral banks will, I be­lieve, be the way of the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>A PRIMER ON DIG­I­TAL CUR­REN­CIES</p>
    <p>But first, some back­ground in­for­ma­tion on dig­i­tal cur­ren­cies.</p>
    <p>Many of us al­ready rou­tinely use elec­tronic forms of money, whether in our bank ac­counts when we trans­fer funds elec­tron­i­cally, or when we top up our PayLah! or Grab ac­counts.</p>
    <p>These are elec­tronic ver­sions of fiat money – money that has value be­cause the gov­ern­ment de­crees it as a le­gal ten­der and peo­ple view it as guar­an­teed by the sov­er­eign.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal or cryp­tocur­ren­cies dif­fer from these fa­mil­iar elec­tronic forms of fiat money.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal or cryp­tocur­ren­cies are se­cured and pre­sum­ably in­al­ter­able dig­i­tal records stored in a dis­trib­uted data­base over the In­ter­net and recog­nised by con­sen­sus as a medium of ex­change in a net­work of in­di­vid­u­als and/or in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>Many cen­tral banks have re­cently said they are plan­ning to is­sue dig­i­tal cur­ren­cies. Called cen­tral bank dig­i­tal cur­ren­cies (CBDCs), these are dig­i­tal ver­sions of fiat money, and should be dis­tin­guished from the dig­i­tal cur­ren­cies, like bit­coin, is­sued by pri­vate in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>With elec­tronic fiat monies (like those dol­lars in your Grab ac­count) widely in use, one may won­der why cen­tral banks still need to digi­tise their fiat monies, and whether such monies are any dif­fer­ent from pri­vately is­sued cryp­tocur­ren­cies.</p>
    <p>To an­swer this ques­tion, we first need to un­der­stand two crit­i­cal con­cepts – credit ex­pan­sion and cen­tralised digi­ti­sa­tion tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>CREDIT EX­PAN­SION</p>
    <p>Credit ex­pan­sion refers to the pro­duc­tion of fiat money by a pri­vate fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion, which fun­da­men­tally dif­fers from print­ing ban­knotes by a cen­tral bank.</p>
    <p>This man­u­fac­tured fiat money by a pri­vate in­sti­tu­tion typ­i­cally re­sides in elec­tron­i­cally recorded ac­counts these days. This elec­tronic fiat money is a con­trac­tual li­a­bil­ity of the is­su­ing in­sti­tu­tion – but it is not fully backed up dol­lar for dol­lar by the un­der­ly­ing fiat money in the form of phys­i­cal ban­knotes.</p>
    <p>A pri­vate fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion may cre­ate elec­tronic fiat money to raise funds for it­self. But be­cause a pri­vate in­sti­tu­tion may be made bank­rupt, the elec­tronic form of fiat money cre­ated by it should there­fore not be viewed as equiv­a­lent in sta­bil­ity or re­li­a­bil­ity to cen­tral bank-is­sued ban­knotes.</p>
    <p>In short, pri­vate fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions through credit ex­pan­sion can gen­er­ate all the elec­tronic fiat monies up to the limit per­mis­si­ble un­der the bank­ing reg­u­la­tions, but peo­ple may not trust that money, know­ing that the pri­vate in­sti­tu­tions can go bank­rupt.</p>
    <p>Cen­tral banks that is­sue dig­i­tal cur­ren­cies are more likely to be trusted be­cause peo­ple should rightly place the same level of con­fi­dence in them as in phys­i­cal ban­knotes.</p>
    <p>DIGI­TI­SA­TION TECH­NOL­OGY</p>
    <p>The sec­ond di­men­sion is on the digi­ti­sa­tion tech­nol­ogy, or the tech­nol­ogy used to digi­tise the is­su­ing and track­ing of money and its myr­iad trans­ac­tions. (Think of the tech­nol­ogy that drives your per­sonal fi­nances – salary cred­ited into bank ac­counts, pay­ments to credit cards, de­posits in bank ac­counts and so on. Now imag­ine that net­work for a coun­try’s busi­ness trans­ac­tions.)</p>
    <p>A cen­tralised data­base that tracks all the var­i­ous in­com­ings and out­go­ings can be highly ef­fi­cient and work to the ad­van­tage of the con­trol­ling party, but a dis­trib­uted ledger is in­her­ently more op­er­a­tionally ro­bust.</p>
    <p>This be­comes ob­vi­ous when one sees an in­sti­tu­tion’s web­site go down while other or­gan­i­sa­tions’ sites are still work­ing.</p>
    <p>Were a cen­tral bank to adopt a cen­tralised digi­ti­sa­tion tech­nol­ogy, that econ­omy might run the risk of its en­tire fi­nan­cial sys­tem frozen for a pe­riod of time, even though that chance is tiny.</p>
    <p>The CBDC be­ing con­tem­plated around the world at this mo­ment is a dig­i­tal fiat money util­is­ing some dis­trib­uted ledger tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>THE PROB­LEMS WITH PRI­VATE CRYP­TOCUR­REN­CIES</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal or cryp­tocur­ren­cies have been pro­lif­er­at­ing in re­cent years. How­ever, I am pes­simistic of those brought for­ward by pri­vate par­ties for four rea­sons.</p>
    <p>First, trust/cred­i­bil­ity is es­sen­tial to any sus­tain­able fi­nan­cial prac­tice, and there is no rea­son to ex­pect an ex­cep­tion for dig­i­tal cur­ren­cies. Even among cen­tral banks, some have not earned the cred­i­bil­ity of run­ning re­spon­si­ble mon­e­tary poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Why should we then place the same level of trust in the re­spon­si­ble run­ning of bit­coin, ethereum or Li­bra as we have on, say, the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore?</p>
    <p>The sec­ond is to recog­nise that trans­ac­tional speed and con­ve­nience are es­sen­tial to a medium of ex­change. Tak­ing 10-plus min­utes to trans­act with bit­coin is cer­tainly im­prac­ti­cal.</p>
    <p>Bit­coin and alike re­quire min­ing, which is an ac­tiv­ity in­volv­ing heavy com­pu­ta­tion to solve a man-made math­e­mat­i­cal prob­lem solely for the pur­pose of en­sur­ing the se­cu­rity and in­tegrity of a per­mis­sion­less blockchain.</p>
    <p>Min­ing is in­cen­tivised with re­wards that demand good com­put­ing equip­ment and consumes a sig­nif­i­cant quan­tity of elec­tric­ity. So, min­ing as it is struc­tured gen­er­ates what econ­o­mists will call neg­a­tive ex­ter­nal­i­ties to so­ci­ety, which are neg­a­tive ef­fects that so­ci­ety bears the cost of.</p>
    <p>Speed­ing up trans­ac­tions for a per­mis­sion­less blockchain re­quires com­pro­mises on its se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Al­ter­na­tively, things can be sped up through a per­mis­sioned blockchain by plac­ing trust in a small com­mu­nity like the Li­bra As­so­ci­a­tion. The trade-off of trust and speed will, how­ever, re­main a dilemma for dig­i­tal cur­ren­cies is­sued by pri­vate en­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>Third, money serves as a store of value. To be de­sir­able, money needs to main­tain sta­ble value for ac­quir­ing goods and ser­vices or for ex­chang­ing to an­other sta­ble cur­rency. Bit­coin and oth­ers’ wide swings in value when mea­sured against, say, the US dol­lar ren­ders them spec­u­la­tive in­stru­ments in­stead of re­li­able stores of value.</p>
    <p>Ef­forts to peg a dig­i­tal cur­rency to a bas­ket of sta­ble cur­ren­cies or pre­cious met­als in a way ac­knowl­edge the es­sen­tial role of cen­tral bank­ing.</p>
    <p>The in­escapable ques­tion of trust, le­git­i­macy and le­gal­ity will sur­face when a pri­vately or­gan­ised com­mu­nity at­tempts to act like a cen­tral bank with­out due ac­count­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, the con­cern over fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity mo­ti­vates and le­git­imises var­i­ous bank­ing reg­u­la­tions. A com­ple­men­tary cur­rency, in a dig­i­tal form or not, is a po­ten­tially desta­bil­is­ing fac­tor, and its suc­cess must in­vite right­ful scrutiny from the af­fected sov­er­eigns.</p>
    <p>THE AD­VAN­TAGES OF CEN­TRAL BANK DIG­I­TAL CUR­REN­CIES</p>
    <p>In con­trast, the eco­nomics for CBDCs to re­place ban­knotes and coins is com­pelling.</p>
    <p>Mint­ing and print­ing costs are quite sub­stan­tial, and fears of re­ceiv­ing coun­ter­feit ban­knotes are ever present in our minds. Hav­ing armed guards to trans­port cash in ar­moured ve­hi­cles im­ply high costs of han­dling cash.</p>
    <p>The trust-speed dilemma men­tioned ear­lier can be nat­u­rally solved by CBDCs be­cause the reg­u­lated bank­ing net­work over­seen by a cen­tral bank is a trusted com­mu­nity al­ready in place for im­ple­ment­ing an ef­fi­cient dig­i­tal fiat cur­rency.</p>
    <p>I have learnt from me­dia re­ports and pri­vate con­ver­sa­tions that some CBDCs al­ready stand ready to ad­vance be­yond the test­ing stage.</p>
    <p>The be­gin­ning of the grad­ual phas­ing out of ban­knotes and coins can be ini­ti­ated by a cen­tral bank, but ac­cep­tance by peo­ple will ul­ti­mately de­ter­mine the pace of change.</p>
    <p>Also in­evitable is that the cur­rent dis­trib­uted ledger tech­nol­ogy for CBDCs will even­tu­ally be up­dated with new in­no­va­tions, just as paper ban­knotes were re­placed with poly­mer notes in Sin­ga­pore and other ju­ris­dic­tions.</p>
    <p>Thanks to dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies, CBDCs will likely emerge as a mod­ern form of money equiv­a­lent to ban­knotes and minted coins.</p>
    <p>The day is on the hori­zon when our mo­bile de­vices loaded with dig­i­tal wal­lets al­low us to di­rectly pay and re­ceive dig­i­tal Sin­ga­pore dol­lars, Chi­nese yuan and Bri­tish pounds.</p>
    <p>At the same time, many of our daily trans­ac­tions will likely con­tinue to be in elec­tronic fiat money like now. Even with CBDCs widespread, my pre­dic­tion is that each of us, driven by con­ve­nience or ne­ces­sity, will con­tinue to reg­u­larly use var­i­ous pay­ment chan­nels like PayNow, Ali­pay or bank ac­counts to elec­tron­i­cally set­tle trans­ac­tions in fiat monies in­ter­me­di­ated through fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>Will phys­i­cal ban­knotes dis­ap­pear to be re­placed by dig­i­tal fiat monies? The an­swer is af­fir­ma­tive. Think of how Sin­ga­pore dis­abled the 2G mo­bile net­work in 2017.</p>
    <p>It is only a mat­ter of time.</p>
