    <p>The lat­est move by the Govern­ment to ex­pand Covid-19 test­ing to com­mu­nity groups is a good strat­egy to catch asymp­to­matic in­fec­tions, Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But he added that mak­ing such a scheme manda­tory would not be an ef­fi­cient way of us­ing Sin­ga­pore’s test­ing ca­pa­bil­ity, es­pe­cially given the low rate of com­mu­nity trans­mis­sions here, as a vast ma­jor­ity of the tests in such a sce­nario will likely turn out neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry (MOH) said last Satur­day that it would of­fer a one-time coro­n­avirus test to groups such as taxi and pri­vate-hire car driv­ers and food de­liv­ery work­ers to get a bet­ter pic­ture of Covid-19 preva­lence in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Other groups that will be in­cluded un­der this scheme are key ven­dors ser­vic­ing for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries, as well as stall­hold­ers at hawker centres, mar­kets and sim­i­lar food and bev­er­age es­tab­lish­ments such as cof­fee shops.</p>
    <p>The costs of such tests will be fully paid for by the Govern­ment, but they are not com­pul­sory.</p>
    <p>In­stead, MOH said it “strongly en­cour­ages” in­di­vid­u­als in such groups to get tested.</p>
    <p>Prof Teo told The Straits Times yes­ter­day: “Based on the present sit­u­a­tion of com­mu­nity spread in Sin­ga­pore, where our case counts are ac­tu­ally very low, mak­ing this scheme a manda­tory (one) will mean (di­vert­ing) tens of thou­sands of tests to screen these peo­ple, where the vast ma­jor­ity will ac­tu­ally be neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing di­rectly to manda­tory test­ing will not be an ef­fi­cient use of our test­ing ca­pa­bil­ity.”</p>
    <p>He added that mak­ing the scheme vol­un­tary will still al­low the au­thor­i­ties to get a sense of the preva­lence of missed asymp­to­matic in­fec­tions in the com­mu­nity among “high touch­point” groups.</p>
    <p>“If we re­alise the preva­lence is ac­tu­ally not low, then this will be a sig­nal to make the test­ing more sys­tem­atic, per­haps by mak­ing it manda­tory,” he added.</p>
    <p>In Hong Kong, vol­un­tary coro­n­avirus test­ing has pro­duced less than sat­is­fac­tory re­sults.</p>
    <p>The ter­ri­tory an­nounced such a scheme for its en­tire pop­u­la­tion on Tues­day but, by its sec­ond day, only about one-tenth of its 7.5 mil­lion peo­ple had signed up – far fewer than the num­ber nec­es­sary for the au­thor­i­ties to com­pre­hen­sively dis­cover hid­den in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>In China’s Wuhan – the orig­i­nal epi­cen­tre of the out­break – manda­tory mass test­ing for 11 mil­lion peo­ple was car­ried out from May 14 to June 1.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties there have re</p>
    <p>opened all its schools, and do­mes­tic tourists have re­turned.</p>
    <p>Prof Teo noted that Sin­ga­pore has some key fea­tures which make vol­un­tary test­ing suit­able.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore is smaller, and this makes it eas­ier to co­or­di­nate our screen­ing. Our com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion rates are also very low, and this makes a vol­un­tary scheme much more rel­e­vant to un­der­stand the ex­tent of asymp­to­matic in­fec­tions in the com­mu­nity,” he said.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Tan Ern Ser</p>
    <p>of the depart­ment of so­ci­ol­ogy at NUS’ Fac­ulty of Arts and So­cial Sciences said that while a com­pul­sory test­ing scheme may give a bet­ter as­sur­ance that the virus is no longer lurk­ing within the pop­u­lace, it would be costlier in terms of time and money.</p>
    <p>He said vol­un­tary test­ing would be prac­ti­cal only if the coro­n­avirus sit­u­a­tion was rea­son­ably well con­tained, as it cur­rently is here.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore al­ready has pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures in place, he said, such</p>
    <p>as manda­tory mask wear­ing and safe dis­tanc­ing, al­low­ing com­mu­nity cases to be kept low.</p>
    <p>Point­ing to how most peo­ple here have been com­ply­ing with such mea­sures, he added: “The ma­jor­ity of Sin­ga­pore­ans are law-abid­ing and would self-po­lice...</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore­ans are prag­matic peo­ple, they would do what is nec­es­sary to get back to their pre­ferred way of life.”</p>
