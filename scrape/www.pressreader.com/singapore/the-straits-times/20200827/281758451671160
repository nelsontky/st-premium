    <p>Coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions in the Philip­pines topped 200,000 yes­ter­day – more than half of which were re­ported this month alone – damp­en­ing hopes that the coun­try could fi­nally see a “flat­ten­ing of the curve” by next month.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry re­ported 5,277 new cases of Covid-19 yes­ter­day, tak­ing the Philip­pines’ to­tal caseload to 202,361.</p>
    <p>At least 118,000 of these cases were added to the tally this month.</p>
    <p>Ninety-nine more deaths from the coro­n­avirus were also re­ported yes­ter­day. More than 3,100 have so far died in the Philip­pines, a third of which oc­curred this month alone.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines has the most num­ber of cases in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>The coun­try crossed an­other grim mile­stone de­spite a two-week lock­down en­forced early this month and as­sur­ances from health of­fi­cials that a “re­booted” re­sponse should slow the virus’ spread.</p>
    <p>Be­fore that lock­down, most of the Philip­pines went through one of the world’s strictest and long­est shel­ter-at-home re­stric­tions from mid-March to May.</p>
    <p>Since those re­stric­tions were eased, how­ever, cases have surged, from just 300 to 500 a day to an av­er­age of 4,500 in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>This month’s lock­down again grounded some 27 mil­lion peo­ple in­side their homes. This was sup­posed to give hos­pi­tals a breather, af­ter health groups warned that the health sys­tem was close to col­laps­ing.</p>
    <p>But a week af­ter stay-at-home curbs were re­laxed, and de­spite the prom­ise of a “re­freshed” re­sponse, hos­pi­tals re­main over­whelmed with pa­tients, and health work­ers say they are still work­ing more hours, cov­er­ing more ground and get­ting mea­gre pay.</p>
    <p>About three-quar­ters of hospi­tal beds re­served for coro­n­avirus pa­tients are oc­cu­pied, ac­cord­ing to a daily bul­letin from the Health Min­istry.</p>
    <p>Data an­a­lysts at the state-run Uni­ver­sity of the Philip­pines had fore­cast a “flat­ten­ing of the curve” by the end of next month.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion is “not yet out of con­trol”, said Pro­fes­sor Guido David, who heads a re­search team at the uni­ver­sity. “Flat­ten­ing does not mean it is over. It means there are still cases but the num­ber of cases is on the de­cline.”</p>
    <p>He said Covid-19 cases in the</p>
    <p>Philip­pines would have surged to 250,000 by Aug 31, if not for the lock­down and other mea­sures the gov­ern­ment is now tak­ing.</p>
    <p>But Health Un­der­sec­re­tary Maria Rosario Vergeire said “noth­ing is cer­tain at this point”.</p>
    <p>An­other lock­down to con­tain the out­break is un­likely. The gov­ern­ment has al­ready piv­oted from pur­su­ing a more ag­gres­sive ap­proach to tackle the coro­n­avirus to restart­ing a shrink­ing econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pine econ­omy suf­fered its deep­est slump on record in the sec­ond quar­ter, plung­ing the na­tion into a re­ces­sion with lit­tle hope of a quick re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment economists pinned that on crip­pling mea­sures en­forced dur­ing the sweep­ing lock­down from mid-March to May 31 that shut down three quar­ters of the econ­omy. At least three mil­lion peo­ple lost their jobs as busi­nesses both large and small were ei­ther closed or down­sized.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte has said the gov­ern­ment no longer has money to feed those who have lost the means to earn a liv­ing.</p>
    <p>He is in­stead pin­ning the na­tion’s chances of a re­cov­ery on a vac­cine that may not come till De­cem­ber.</p>
