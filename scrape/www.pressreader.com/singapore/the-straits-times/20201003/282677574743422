    <p>The fa­bled Orient Ex­press is set to roll into Sin­ga­pore in De­cem­ber – as a pop-up at­trac­tion called Once Upon A Time On The Orient Ex­press at the West Lawn of Gar­dens by the Bay.</p>
    <p>The lux­ury train in­spired lit­er­ary clas­sics such as Mur­der On The Orient Ex­press by Agatha Christie and Stam­boul Train by Graham Greene.</p>
    <p>This is the first time the show­case (right) of the lux­ury train is be­ing seen out­side of France.</p>
    <p>The orig­i­nal Orient Ex­press was in­au­gu­rated in 1883.</p>
    <p>The ex­hi­bi­tion will in­volve mov­ing a lo­co­mo­tive built in France over a cen­tury ago, a 1930s sleeper car weigh­ing close to 200 tonnes and more than 300 del­i­cate items and doc­u­ments; as well as restor­ing fur­nish­ings and dis­plays i n the car­riages to their for­mer glory.</p>
    <p>Putting the at­trac­tion in place is a feat in it­self as the ex­hibits are clas­si­fied as his­tor­i­cal mon­u­ments. They will show­case the legacy of the train as well as events that trans­formed the world and helped shape the Euro­pean map.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors will be able to tem­po­rar­ily put them­selves in the shoes of Orient Ex­press trav­ellers at a re­con­sti­tuted train plat­form and in an ac­tual car­riage from the train.</p>
    <p>Info: Once Upon A Time On The Orient Ex­press runs from Dec 12 till June 13 next year.</p>
    <p>Tick­ets are avail­able from Sis­tic (www.sis­tic.com.sg). A stan­dard sin­gle ticket costs $25; fam­ily bun­dle tick­ets for two adults and two chil­dren are at $88.</p>
