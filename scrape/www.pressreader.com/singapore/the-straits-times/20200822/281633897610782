    <p>Max­i­mum number of peo­ple al­lowed in one class.</p>
    <p>Min­i­mum dis­tance be­tween class mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Ex­er­cise classes con­ducted by in­struc­tors will be al­lowed to take place at more open spa­ces at SportSG sport cen­tres and Hous­ing Board ar­eas from Sept 1, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said at a vir­tual multi-min­istry press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Classes in the newly opened ar­eas must be or­gan­ised by an in­struc­tor who will be re­spon­si­ble for en­sur­ing that the safe man­age­ment mea­sures are put in place and ad­hered to, he added.</p>
    <p>Such mea­sures in­clude tem­per­a­ture and symp­tom screen­ing, safe dis­tanc­ing, and keep­ing a list of par­tic­i­pants at venues where SafeEn­try, the national check-in sys­tem, is not de­ployed.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said: “The re­quire­ment is that all in­struc­tors who are con­duct­ing such classes will have to be reg­is­tered, and there will be a reg­is­tra­tion process put in place.”</p>
    <p>“They will have to be quite care­ful in mak­ing sure they know who are the par­tic­i­pants in their classes, that they do all the nec­es­sary checks,” he added.</p>
    <p>More de­tails will be re­leased in time, he said.</p>
    <p>Since the start of phase two on June 19, or­gan­ised ex­er­cise classes con­ducted by in­struc­tors have been al­lowed in both pri­vate and pub­lic sports fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The classes are sub­ject to the venue owners’ per­mis­sion and con­di­tions, up to a to­tal class size of 50 peo­ple or lower, de­pend­ing on the venue ca­pac­ity and whether safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures can be ad­hered to.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants must ad­here to a 2m safe dis­tanc­ing be­tween one an­other, un­less the ac­tiv­ity re­quires other­wise, and a 3m safe dis­tanc­ing be­tween groups.</p>
    <p>Sport Sin­ga­pore ad­vi­sories on June 18 and 24 noted that masks should be worn as a de­fault, among other mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“Masks can be taken off when per­form­ing stren­u­ous ac­tiv­i­ties, although it is still rec­om­mended as good prac­tice even un­der such cir­cum­stances,” the ad­vi­sories noted.</p>
    <p>Shar­ing of com­mon equip­ment should be avoided and par­tic­i­pants should bring their own equip­ment if pos­si­ble, they added.</p>
    <p>“Per­sonal equip­ment should not be shared.</p>
    <p>“If this can­not be done, then equip­ment should be wiped down or sani­tised fre­quently.</p>
    <p>“This in­cludes gym equip­ment such as weights, and sport equip­ment such as bas­ket­balls,” the ad­vi­sories said.</p>
