    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON Amer­i­cans are rush­ing to cast bal­lots ahead of the Nov 3 elec­tion at an un­prece­dented pace, early vot­ing num­bers show, in­di­cat­ing a pos­si­ble record turnout for the show­down be­tween United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and Demo­cratic chal­lenger Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>With less than four weeks to go be­fore Elec­tion Day, more than 6.6 mil­lion Amer­i­cans have al­ready voted, more than 10 times the num­ber who had done so in 2016, ac­cord­ing to the US Elec­tions Project, which com­piles early vot­ing data.</p>
    <p>The shift has been driven by an ex­pan­sion of early and mail-in vot­ing in many states as a safe way to cast a bal­lot dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and an ea­ger­ness to weigh in on the po­lit­i­cal fu­ture of Mr Trump, said Dr Michael McDon­ald of the Univer­sity of Florida, who ad­min­is­ters the project.</p>
    <p>“We’ve never seen this many peo­ple vot­ing so far ahead of an elec­tion,” Dr McDon­ald said in an in­ter­view ear­lier this week.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple cast their bal­lots when they make up their minds, and we know that many peo­ple made up their minds long ago and al­ready have a judg­ment about Trump.”</p>
    <p>The early surge has led Dr McDon­ald to pre­dict a record turnout of about 150 mil­lion, rep­re­sent­ing 65 per cent of el­i­gi­ble vot­ers, the high­est rate since 1908.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den leads Mr Trump in na­tional opinion polls, al­though sur­veys in cru­cial bat­tle­ground states in­di­cate a tighter race.</p>
    <p>The num­bers re­ported so far come from 34 states plus the District of Columbia.</p>
    <p>All but about a half-dozen states al­low some level of early in-per­son vot­ing.</p>
    <p>The per­cent­age of vot­ers who cast their bal­lot at a vot­ing ma­chine on Elec­tion Day al­ready had been in steady de­cline be­fore this year, ac­cord­ing to the US Elec­tion As­sis­tance Com­mis­sion, a fed­eral agency.</p>
    <p>The to­tal num­ber of early or mail-in votes more than dou­bled from nearly 25 mil­lion in 2004 to 57 mil­lion in 2016, it said, rep­re­sent­ing an in­crease from one in</p>
    <p>five of all bal­lots cast to two in five of all bal­lots cast.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has railed against mailin vot­ing, mak­ing un­founded ac­cu­sa­tions that it leads to fraud. Ex­perts have said such fraud is rare.</p>
    <p>Those at­tacks by the Pres­i­dent have shown signs of de­press­ing Repub­li­can in­ter­est in vot­ing by mail.</p>
    <p>Democrats have more than dou­bled the num­ber of re­turned mail</p>
    <p>in bal­lots by Repub­li­cans in seven states that report voter reg­is­tra­tion data by party, ac­cord­ing to the Elec­tions Project.</p>
    <p>A na­tional Reuters/Ip­sos poll taken last week found that 5 per cent of Democrats na­tion­wide said they had al­ready voted, com­pared with 2 per cent of Repub­li­cans.</p>
    <p>About 58 per cent of Democrats planned to vote early com­pared</p>
    <p>with 40 per cent of Repub­li­cans.</p>
    <p>Dr McDon­ald said early vot­ing typ­i­cally starts strong, then drops be­fore surg­ing just ahead of Elec­tion Day. But in some states, rates of par­tic­i­pa­tion have al­ready sky­rock­eted a month out.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­cans are steadily los­ing con­fi­dence in Mr Trump’s han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, with his net ap­proval on the is­sue that has</p>
    <p>dom­i­nated the US elec­tion hit­ting a record low in a new Reuters/Ip­sos poll.</p>
    <p>The poll taken from Tues­day through Thurs­day, af­ter Mr Trump’s Covid-19 in­fec­tion last week and week­end hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion, found 37 per cent of Amer­i­can adults ap­proved of the Pres­i­dent’s han­dling of the pan­demic and 59 per cent dis­ap­proved.</p>
    <p>The net rating of neg­a­tive 22 per­cent­age points is the low­est in the poll dat­ing back to March 2 and has steadily de­clined over the past 10 days, as Mr Trump’s ill­ness and his re­turn to work in the White House dom­i­nated news head­lines.</p>
    <p>His rating on the is­sue was a neg­a­tive 11 points in a Reuters/Ip­sos poll taken from Sept 30-Oct 1.</p>
