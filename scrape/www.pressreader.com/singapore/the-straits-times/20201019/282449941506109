    <p>There is now more re­search that sug­gests peo­ple who are obese and over­weight have a higher risk of de­vel­op­ing Covid-19, par­tic­u­larly a more se­vere form of the disease.</p>
    <p>It’s not only that, but once they end up in the in­ten­sive care unit, their risk of dy­ing from Covid-19 is two to three times higher than that of a Covid-19 pa­tient of nor­mal weight.</p>
    <p>The main rea­son obese pa­tients have a higher risk of get­ting Covid-19 and be­com­ing se­verely ill with it is be­cause the coro­n­avirus has an affin­ity for ACE2 re­cep­tors, which are also present in fat.</p>
    <p>ACE2 is a pro­tein on the sur­face of many cell types that acts as a re­cep­tor for the coro­n­avirus to get into cells.</p>
    <p>So, the more fat one has, the more ACE2 re­cep­tors he will have. Obese pa­tients thus end up with a higher vi­ral load.</p>
    <p>The ex­cess fat also leads to de­creased move­ment of res­pi­ra­tory mus­cles, such as the di­aphragm and thus, when obese per­sons con­tract the res­pi­ra­tory virus, they have an in­creased risk of de­vel­op­ing com­pli­ca­tions that re­quire in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>An­other thing is that obese pa­tients also have other co-mor­bidi­ties, mainly di­a­betes, though it can be hy­per­ten­sion, asthma, lung and heart disease. These con­di­tions add to their chronic in­flam­ma­tory state, giv­ing them an ex­ag­ger­ated re­sponse and worse out­come.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple with di­a­betes are gen­er­ally at in­creased risk of in­fec­tions, in­clud­ing in­fluenza and bac­te­rial pneu­mo­nia, as their im­mu­nity weak­ens if their blood sugar lev­els are not well con­trolled.</p>
    <p>If these peo­ple are also obese, their im­mu­nity is likely fur­ther weak­ened, hence putting them at higher risk of be­com­ing more ill with Covid-19 when in­fected.</p>
    <p>Obe­sity and di­a­betes very of­ten re­sult from – or are made worse by – poor life­style choices, in­clud­ing poor health choices, smok­ing and a seden­tary life­style.</p>
    <p>These fac­tors on their own al­ready con­trib­ute to an in­creased risk of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>So, should peo­ple with obe­sity adopt more pre­cau­tions in this Covid-19 pan­demic?</p>
    <p>We think there is no need to, though it is im­por­tant that they are aware they are at greater risk of de­vel­op­ing more se­vere in­fec­tions with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>This aware­ness will spur them to take the cor­rect pre­cau­tions rec­om­mended by the Min­istry of Health, in­clud­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing, good per­sonal hy­giene and wear­ing a mask when out.</p>
    <p>We also rec­om­mend the fol­low­ing:</p>
    <p>• Make sure you have all the rel­e­vant con­tact de­tails on hand, in­clud­ing your fam­ily’s and med­i­cal prac­ti­tioner’s con­tacts in case you fall ill un­ex­pect­edly.</p>
    <p>• If you have di­a­betes, be mind­ful of your blood sugar con­trol.</p>
    <p>This is es­pe­cially true as any in­fec­tion can cause a rise in your blood sugar lev­els.</p>
    <p>With re­gard to food, try to give pri­or­ity to foods with a low gly­caemic in­dex, such as veg­eta­bles, brown rice and whole-wheat food.</p>
    <p>Choose lean pro­teins and eat green leafy veg­eta­bles and fruits. Snack less in or­der to limit the con­sump­tion of foods high in sugar, car­bo­hy­drates and fat.</p>
    <p>• Try to keep a reg­u­lar sched­ule. Avoid over­work­ing, get ad­e­quate sleep and ex­er­cise as much as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>• Those who are mor­bidly obese and have poorly con­trolled di­a­betes may con­sider un­der­go­ing bariatric surgery, which is also known as meta­bolic surgery.</p>
    <p>This is where we make your stom­ach smaller with the use of a band or other meth­ods so that you will get used to eat­ing the amount that you need and no more.</p>
    <p>It is rec­om­mended for those who have a body mass in­dex (BMI) of more than 32.5 and co-mor­bidi­ties such as di­a­betes, hy­per­ten­sion and high choles­terol.</p>
    <p>Those who have a BMI of more than 37.5 can con­sider it, even if they do not have any co-mor­bidi­ties.</p>
    <p>Surgery can also be done if your di­a­betes is not un­der op­ti­mal con­trol de­spite med­i­ca­tions, as this can lead to se­ri­ous com­pli­ca­tions such as kid­ney dam­age, liver dam­age, heart at­tacks, stroke and a Covid-19 in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Those who choose to have bariatric surgery will re­duce their risk of hav­ing Covid-19, though not im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>Bariatric surgery will re­sult in rel­a­tively rapid weight loss, but it takes time and the in­di­vid­ual still needs to make the ef­fort to main­tain his or her weight af­ter that.</p>
    <p>The ben­e­fits of the surgery will be ev­i­dent af­ter about three to six months, when the in­di­vid­ual loses 10 to 15 per cent of his or her ex­cess body weight loss. ar­den­jrs@gmail.com</p>
