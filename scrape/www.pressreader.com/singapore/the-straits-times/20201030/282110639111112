    <p>• The Thai Par­lia­ment has lost its first trans­gen­der MP af­ter the con­sti­tu­tional court re­voked her seat in what crit­ics called a po­lit­i­cal move against sup­port­ers of the king­dom’s prodemoc­racy move­ment.</p>
    <p>Ms Tanwarin Sukkhapisi­t, a film-maker, was a pi­o­neer for the LGBT (les­bian, gay, bi­sex­ual and trans­gen­der) com­mu­nity when she won a seat for the Fu­ture For­ward Party at last year’s polls.</p>
    <p>But the party was dis­solved in Fe­bru­ary, a move that es­ca­lated dis­con­tent and fu­elled prodemoc­racy ac­tivists’ de­mand that the gov­ern­ment step down.</p>
    <p>Dozens of its MPs, in­clud­ing Ms Tanwarin, joined the Move For­ward Party, but a judge ruled on Wed­nes­day that, as a stock­holder of a me­dia firm, she had breached elec­toral law and must va­cate her par­lia­men­tary seat.</p>
    <p>“I’m not sur­prised – I ex­pected this to hap­pen,” she told AFP, adding that she did not think the de­ci­sion was re­lated to her gen­der iden­tity. “I will con­tinue my work fight­ing for bet­ter out­comes for the LGBT com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s trans­gen­der com­mu­nity is high-pro­file but faces ed­u­ca­tion and work­place dis­crim­i­na­tion in the Bud­dhist na­tion. The coun­try’s Par­lia­ment still has three other trans­gen­der MPs.</p>
    <p>Move For­ward Party l eader Pita Lim­jaroen­rat told AFP the rul­ing was dis­ap­point­ing but hailed Ms Tanwarin’s le­gacy. “Even if we lose an MP to­day, I think we have a na­tional icon when it comes to free­dom and gen­der equal­ity.”</p>
    <p>Ms Tanwarin is the lat­est ca­su­alty of a law that many claim the gov­ern­ment is us­ing as a po­lit­i­cal weapon.</p>
    <p>“They are try­ing to use a le­gal mech­a­nism against who­ever they as­sume sup­ports the (prodemoc­racy) move­ment,” said po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Ti­tipol Phakdee­wanich.</p>
    <p>WORK FOR LGBT CAUSES CON­TIN­UES</p>
    <p>I’m not sur­prised – I ex­pected this to hap­pen. I will con­tinue my work fight­ing for bet­ter out­comes for the LGBT com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>MS TANWARIN SUKKHAPISI­T, Thai­land’s first trans­gen­der MP, who has had her seat re­voked.</p>
