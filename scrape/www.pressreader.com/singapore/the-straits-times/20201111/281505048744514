    <p>The Malaysian au­thor­i­ties have re­cov­ered the bod­ies of two vic­tims, be­lieved to be guests stay­ing at a villa in the Ban­jaran Hot­springs Re­treat in Ipoh, af­ter a land­slide yes­ter­day. The land­slide is likely to have oc­curred due to re­cent heavy rain.</p>
    <p>A land­slide be­lieved to have been trig­gered by heavy rain has claimed the lives of two peo­ple stay­ing at a re­sort in the Malaysian state of Perak.</p>
    <p>The bod­ies of the vic­tims – Ooi</p>
    <p>Chee Wei, 39, and Lee Tze Jun, 32 – were found yes­ter­day near each other in the jacuzzi area of the lux­ury Ban­jaran Hot­springs Re­treat in Ipoh, the state cap­i­tal.</p>

    <p>VIC­TIMS DID NOT SHOW UP</p>
    <p>ment chief Azmi Os­man said res­cuers dig­ging through the mud found the pair within five min­utes of each other.</p>
    <p>“When the land­slide oc­curred at around 1am (yes­ter­day), all oc­cu­pants were told to va­cate the hol­i­day units and re­port at the concierge, but the vic­tims had failed to do so.</p>
    <p>“This prompted a staff mem­ber to go to their unit, which was locked. The cou­ple had not re­sponded to any calls,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The staff mem­ber climbed over the wall and dis­cov­ered that the jacuzzi area in their unit was filled with soil. The re­sort then alerted the au­thor­i­ties,” he added.</p>
    <p>Act­ing Perak po­lice chief Goh Boon Keng told re­porters that a search and res­cue mis­sion was im­me­di­ately launched af­ter the call at 1.28am yes­ter­day, and of­fi­cers from Ipoh were de­ployed to the scene.</p>
    <p>“But we were forced to stop our op­er­a­tion fol­low­ing the de­tec­tion of soil move­ment. We re­sumed at around 7am,” he added.</p>
    <p>The vic­tims were found at 9.55am and pro­nounced dead at the scene. The bod­ies were sent to the Raja Per­maisuri Bainun Hospi­tal for au­top­sies.</p>
    <p>The hilly area where the re­sort is lo­cated has been hit by heavy rain since Mon­day that has soft­ened the soil, ac­cord­ing to Perak Min­eral and Geo­science De­part­ment deputy direc­tor Mat Niza Ab­dul Rah­man.</p>
    <p>“This area is sur­rounded by lime­stone and sur­plus soil. To the naked eye, it looks pretty sta­ble but the soil had soft­ened fol­low­ing the heavy rain last night.</p>
    <p>“When the soil is soft, it can lead to a land­slide. And it can hap­pen again,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Ban­jaran Hot­springs Re­treat said in a state­ment yes­ter­day that it is work­ing with the au­thor­i­ties to reach out to the fam­i­lies of the two guests, to pro­vide them with sup­port and as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>“No other guests and staff are af­fected and all have been moved to a safe area,” it added.</p>
    <p>The re­sort said it meets all safety re­quire­ments and pro­to­cols set by the au­thor­i­ties, and op­er­ates to in­ter­na­tional stan­dards.</p>
    <p>“The health and safety of our guests and all staff have al­ways been our top pri­or­ity... We are un­able to make fur­ther com­ments as po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tion is un­der way,” it said.</p>
    <p>When the land­slide oc­curred at around 1am, all oc­cu­pants were told to va­cate the hol­i­day units and re­port at the concierge, but the vic­tims had failed to do so... A staff mem­ber... climbed over the wall and dis­cov­ered that the jacuzzi area in their unit was filled with soil.</p>
