    <p>Last month, Sav­ills listed the Bow­den Park es­tate for £35 mil­lion (S$62.5 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>The prop­erty in­cludes a 15,900 sq ft, 18th cen­tury man­sion set amid 8.9ha of man­i­cured gar­dens and 567ha of farm­land in Wilt­shire, which is about a two-hour drive from cen­tral Lon­don.</p>
    <p>In any other year, the prop­erty would likely have sat on the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>But thanks i n large part to Covid-19-re­lated lock­downs, a stag­ger­ing 19 coun­try es­tates in Bri­tain have sold or are un­der of­fer for over £15 mil­lion this year, ac­cord­ing to Sav­ills.</p>
    <p>The Bow­den Park es­tate, in other words, has sud­denly en­tered a seller’s mar­ket.</p>
    <p>From May 13 to June 24, for in­stance, the num­ber of ac­cepted of­fers for coun­try houses from £5 mil­lion and £10 mil­lion was 182 per cent higher than the five-year av­er­age, ac­cord­ing to a Knight Frank re­port; all price brack­ets in the pe­riod were 64 per cent higher than the same five-year av­er­age.</p>
    <p>Mir­ror­ing trends in New York and San Fran­cisco, wealthy Lon­don res­i­dents have started to re­assess their ur­ban life­styles. Sud­denly, sec­ond homes are be­com­ing pri­mary homes, and buy­ers are will­ing to look far­ther afield and en­dure longer com­mutes.</p>
    <p>Mr Ed­ward Rook, head of the coun­try depart­ment at Knight Frank, said: “A lot of peo­ple are mak­ing coun­try houses their pri­mary home. In­stead of hav­ing a large house in Lon­don and maybe a cot­tage in the coun­try, they’re re­vers­ing that and hav­ing a smaller apart­ment in Lon­don and a prin­ci­pal res­i­dence in the coun­try.”</p>
    <p>The ex­cep­tion, Mr Rook notes, is houses that cost more than £10 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>“It’s still very much a sec­ond­home mar­ket, be­cause buy­ers will re­tain an­other house, ei­ther in cen­tral Lon­don or glob­ally else­where.”</p>
    <p>High-net-worth, Lon­don-based res­i­dents, many of whom come from Asia or the Mid­dle East, prob­a­bly have mul­ti­ple homes al­ready, Mr Crispin Hol­borow, coun­try di­rec­tor of Sav­ills’ Pri­vate Of­fice, said.</p>
    <p>Still, dur­ing Lon­don’s sum­mer lock­down, he added: “It’s quite a sober­ing feel­ing, where you’re sit­ting in your lat­eral flat, in air-con­di­tion­ing, and you’re look­ing at your friends sit­ting in glo­ri­ous sun­shine on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese are nor­mally peo­ple who would jump on their plane and go.”</p>
    <p>But sud­denly, with bor­ders shut down, they had nowhere to go.</p>
    <p>All of that, he con­cludes, has ended with a surge in buy­ers.</p>

It is now a seller&#x2019;s mar&#xAD;ket in the coun&#xAD;try houses seg&#xAD;ment, with wealthy Lon&#xAD;don&#xAD;ers mak&#xAD;ing their coun&#xAD;try houses their pri&#xAD;mary homes, while buy&#xAD;ers are will&#xAD;ing to look far&#xAD;ther afield.</p>
