    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • The Kuala Lumpur High Court has granted Malaysia’s gov­ern­ment an in­terim or­der to pre­vent US$340 mil­lion (S$471 mil­lion) of funds linked to 1MDB from be­ing moved from PetroSaudi In­ter­na­tional’s ac­counts in the United King­dom.</p>
    <p>A judge has set Aug 28 for the next hear­ing on the for­fei­ture law­suit filed by the Malaysian gov­ern­ment against PetroSaudi and its di­rec­tor Tarek Obaid.</p>
    <p>Tarek had pre­vi­ously been charged in his ab­sence with en­gag­ing in crim­i­nal con­spir­acy with the coun­try’s for­mer prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak and with il­le­gally re­ceiv­ing US$300 mil­lion from 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had (1MDB).</p>
    <p>“This is the first step, to freeze the ac­count, the next step is to bring the money back,” said Mr Niza­mud­din Hamid, a lawyer for the Malaysian Anti-Cor­rup­tion Com­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>The money has been moved to an es­crow ac­count held by Clyde & Co in Lon­don and the com­mis­sion will sub­mit a mu­tual le­gal as­sis­tance re­quest to the UK au­thor­i­ties to freeze the funds.</p>
    <p>The 1MDB scan­dal has sparked global in­ves­ti­ga­tions into cor­rup­tion and money laun­der­ing with pros­e­cu­tors es­ti­mat­ing US$4.5 bil­lion was si­phoned from the Malaysian in­vest­ment fund.</p>
    <p>Since Na­jib was ousted i n 2018, the coun­try has re­opened in­ves­ti­ga­tions and sought to find the bil­lions of dol­lars miss­ing from 1MDB. It has brought back US$600 mil­lion with help from the Amer­i­can au­thor­i­ties and re­couped mil­lions of dol­lars more with as­sis­tance from Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Na­jib’s party has since re­turned to power fol­low­ing po­lit­i­cal tur­moil i n Fe­bru­ary that ended with the ap­point­ment of Tan Sri Muhyid­din Yassin as Prime Min­is­ter. Mr Muhyid­din has pledged to con­tinue fight­ing cor­rup­tion and work­ing with the au­thor­i­ties around the world to re­coup the funds, even as his gov­ern­ment faced back­lash for strik­ing a deal with Na­jib’s step­son to drop a dif­fer­ent set of 1MDB-re­lated charges.</p>
