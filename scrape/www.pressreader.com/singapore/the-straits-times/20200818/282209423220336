    <p>per cent as lock­down mea­sures to pre­vent the spread of the virus kept con­sumers at home.</p>
    <p>Ex­ter­nal de­mand – ex­ports mi­nus im­ports – shaved a record 3 per­cent­age points off GDP, as over­seas ship­ments plunged 18.5 per cent, with auto ex­ports hit par­tic­u­larly hard. Falling global ve­hi­cle sales have hurt au­tomak­ers like Mazda and Nis­san – among the big­gest driv­ers of Ja­pan’s econ­omy – and their parts sup­pli­ers.</p>
    <p>Cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­ture de­clined 1.5 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter, less than a me­dian mar­ket forecast for a 4.2 per cent fall, as solid soft­ware in­vest­ment made up for weak spend­ing in other sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Econ­omy Min­is­ter Ya­su­toshi Nishimura con­ceded the GDP read­ings were “pretty se­vere”, but pointed to some bright spots such as a re­cent pickup in con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>“We hope to do our ut­most to push Ja­pan’s econ­omy, which likely bot­tomed out in April and May, back to a re­cov­ery path driven by do­mes­tic de­mand,” he told a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan has de­ployed mas­sive fis­cal and mon­e­tary stim­u­lus to cush­ion the blow from the pan­demic, which hit an econ­omy al­ready reel­ing from last year’s sales tax hike and the US-China trade war.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy has re­opened, but a resur­gence in in­fec­tions clouds the out­look for busi­ness and house­hold spend­ing.</p>
    <p>The baht was little changed at 31.131 per dol­lar af­ter the data. The bench­mark stock in­dex was steady, par­ing ear­lier gains of as much as 0.4 per cent.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s data re­flects the fact that the econ­omy was shut for part of the sec­ond quar­ter and bor­ders remain closed to most for­eign­ers. The govern­ment has grad­u­ally eased re­stric­tions on do­mes­tic movement since May, and al­most all busi­nesses can now open.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment, which has an­nounced US$60 bil­lion (S$82 bil­lion) in stim­u­lus, is also in the midst of chang­ing its eco­nomic team. New Finance Min­is­ter Predee Daochai will need to work with Dr Setha­put Suthi­wartNaruep­ut, who will take over as cen­tral bank gover­nor on Oct 1, to co­or­di­nate fis­cal and mon­e­tary pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Anti-govern­ment protests, mainly by young peo­ple, are start­ing to gain mo­men­tum and add to the un­cer­tainty. More than 10,000 peo­ple ral­lied in Bangkok on Sun­day, one of the big­gest gath­er­ings yet, as pro­test­ers de­mand an end to the mil­i­tary-led ad­min­is­tra­tion and call for the monar­chy’s pow­ers to be reined in.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said: “Not­with­stand­ing the ex­pected pro­longed slump in tourism, the re­cent un­rest in Thai­land may also dampen in­vestor sen­ti­ment, in ad­di­tion to the al­readyfrag­ile con­sump­tion trend.”</p>
