    <p>Chan Yan Ling, 11, runs up and down the full length of the train plat­form while she, her sis­ter Yan Yun, eight, and their do­mes­tic helper Musli wait for the MRT train on their way home af­ter school.</p>
    <p>In the train, the younger girl likes to walk from one end to the other, even when it is crowded, stop­ping oc­ca­sion­ally to play with the grab poles along the way.</p>
    <p>Be­mused passers-by stare. “Autism is an in­vis­i­ble dis­abil­ity that not many peo­ple can see or un­der­stand,” says Mr Ed­ward Chan, 45, the fa­ther of the two girls who were both di­ag­nosed with autism spec­trum dis­or­der (ASD).</p>
    <p>When Yan Ling was in child­care, her teach­ers ob­served that her learn­ing progress was sig­nif­i­cantly slower com­pared with other chil­dren.</p>
    <p>She dis­played ver­bal de­lay at the age of three and did not en­gage dur­ing ac­tiv­i­ties such as group play. She was also dis­rup­tive dur­ing lessons, run­ning from end to end of the open-plan child­care cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Re­al­is­ing their first­born had a mile­stone de­lay, Mr Chan and his wife Bev­erly Soh, 44, took her for a de­vel­op­men­tal check-up. She was di­ag­nosed with ASD at the age of four. Yan Yun was also di­ag­nosed with ASD when she was three.</p>
    <p>ASDs are a range of de­vel­op­men­tal dis­or­ders char­ac­terised by dif­fi­cul­ties in so­cial­i­sa­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tion, and re­stricted or repet­i­tive pat­terns of be­hav­iours and in­ter­est. It is es­ti­mated that one out of 150 chil­dren to­day has some form of ASD.</p>
    <p>Both girls are pupils at Path­light School. When Yan Ling was in Pri­mary 3, she was se­lected by the school to take part in the track and field co-cur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­ity (CCA). How­ever, as no one was able to send her home af­ter the CCA, she did not sign up. She be­gan to show re­luc­tance in learn­ing, es­pe­cially in school­work. She also would not par­tic­i­pate in class ac­tiv­i­ties and would sleep through ex­am­i­na­tions.</p>
    <p>Last year, Mr Chan quit his job as an au­di­tor to be­come a pri­vate-hire car driver. The greater flex­i­bil­ity in his work­ing hours al­low him to spend more time with his chil­dren. Madam Soh works as a se­nior ac­coun­tant.</p>
    <p>With more time for the chil­dren, Mr Chan could go through Yan Ling’s home­work with her and try to spark her in­ter­est in the sub­jects. Yan Ling was also able to pur­sue her CCA of choice. Af­ter nearly a year, she slowly got into the rou­tine of do­ing her home­work, along with other daily ac­tiv­i­ties such as show­er­ing and hav­ing her meals with­out be­ing told to do so. She be­came more con­fi­dent as well, her fa­ther says.</p>
    <p>“The learn­ing for ev­ery autis­tic in­di­vid­ual is dif­fer­ent. For my girls, you can­not teach them from chap­ter one to 10. You some­times have to start from three, then go to 10, and come back to one,” Mr Chan says.</p>
    <p>While Yan Ling’s pas­sion is for sports, Yan Yun has more of a cre­ative streak. When she was younger, the walls of the fam­ily’s liv­ing room were her can­vas, filled with her draw­ings of cars, peo­ple and planes.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan says it is cru­cial for his daugh­ters to be in­de­pen­dent, and not have to rely on oth­ers for help when they are older.</p>
    <p>De­spite the con­sid­er­able progress in public aware­ness and the avail­abil­ity of more cen­tres for chil­dren with special needs, Sin­ga­pore still has a long way to go in terms of in­clu­sive­ness, say ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Only 11 per cent of early in­ter­ven­tion pro­fes­sion­als polled in 2018 thought that Sin­ga­pore is an in­clu­sive so­ci­ety, ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey com­mis­sioned by phil­an­thropic or­gan­i­sa­tion Lien Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>In 2016, another poll found that 28 per cent of par­ents of chil­dren with special needs and 30 per cent of the public thought that Sin­ga­pore is an in­clu­sive so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan and his wife aim to have the girls pick up life skills at dif­fer­ent stages of their lives.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, they are learn­ing to get around on public trans­port on their own. Mr Chan sends his daugh­ters to school in the morn­ing, and then they make their way home on their own, under the su­per­vi­sion of the fam­ily’s do­mes­tic helper.</p>
    <p>The ex­po­sure to public set­tings helps the girls learn so­cial cues and skills, such as con­trol­ling their vol­ume when they self-talk to reg­u­late them­selves. When they are on trains or buses, they have to speak at “vol­ume one” – on a vis­ual vol­ume chart rang­ing from one to five.</p>
    <p>Yan Ling also car­ries a mo­bile phone so she can make a phone call or take pho­tos of her sur­round­ings if she gets lost.</p>
    <p>The great­est les­son for Mr Chan has been learn­ing to adapt. “It’s my in­ter­est ver­sus the chil­dren’s in­ter­est. Their in­ter­est is long term. Af­ter I die, they will strug­gle and not be able to sur­vive if we do not im­part to them the nec­es­sary life skills.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">Since Jan&#xAD;uary, Chan Yan Yun, eight, has been tak&#xAD;ing public trans&#xAD;port home af&#xAD;ter school with her el&#xAD;der sis&#xAD;ter, and under the su&#xAD;per&#xAD;vi&#xAD;sion of the fam&#xAD;ily&#x2019;s do&#xAD;mes&#xAD;tic helper. Dur&#xAD;ing train rides, she likes to walk from one end of the train to the other, even when it is crowded, stop&#xAD;ping oc&#xAD;ca&#xAD;sion&#xAD;ally to play with the grab poles along the way.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Right: Although both Yan Yun and her sis&#xAD;ter Yan Ling, 11, go home from school to&#xAD;gether, they tend to sep&#xAD;a&#xAD;rate from each other on the bus or the train. For ex&#xAD;am&#xAD;ple, on a dou&#xAD;ble-decker bus, one would sit on the up&#xAD;per deck while the other would sit on the lower one. On trains, they would also sit on op&#xAD;po&#xAD;site ends of the cab&#xAD;ins, both left to their own thoughts.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Below: Yan Yun was di&#xAD;ag&#xAD;nosed with autism spec&#xAD;trum dis&#xAD;or&#xAD;der when she was three. She some&#xAD;times has dif&#xAD;fi&#xAD;culty un&#xAD;der&#xAD;stand&#xAD;ing so&#xAD;cial cues and be&#xAD;hav&#xAD;iours. As a re&#xAD;sult, her body lan&#xAD;guage may some&#xAD;times an&#xAD;noy oth&#xAD;ers in public, such as when she sits in a man&#xAD;ner that ap&#xAD;pears im&#xAD;po&#xAD;lite or in&#xAD;ap&#xAD;pro&#xAD;pri&#xAD;ate.</p>
