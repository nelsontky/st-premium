    <p>BEI­JING • China warned that the worst of the del­uges that have led mil­lions to be evac­u­ated may be yet to come, af­ter a third wave of floods formed in the up­per reaches of the Yangtze River on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“The flood con­trol and flood fight­ing sit­u­a­tion is se­vere,” China’s wa­ter re­sources min­istry said in a state­ment. “The new peak may ap­pear later.”</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties or­dered the Three Gorges Reser­voir to save its wa­ter-stor­ing ca­pac­ity in prepa­ra­tion for more flows, and fore­cast an­other three days of tor­ren­tial rain in the south­ern re­gion.</p>
    <p>China’s south has been bat­tered by se­vere floods af­ter wa­ter lev­els reached record peaks.</p>
    <p>Over two mil­lion peo­ple have been evac­u­ated this month along the Yangtze, Asia’s long­est river, with 142 dead or miss­ing since the flood­ing be­gan last month.</p>
    <p>It has also caused over 116 bil­lion yuan (S$23 bil­lion) in dam­age, and im­pacted more than 2.4 mil­lion ha of crops so far this month.</p>
    <p>The Three Gorges Reser­voir is ex­pect­ing wa­ter in­flows to surge to about 60,000 cu­bic m per sec­ond by around to­day.</p>
    <p>The reser­voir level was at 159.46m as of yes­ter­day, down from 164.18m about a week ago. Its max­i­mum level is 175m.</p>
