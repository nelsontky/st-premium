    <p>De­spite hav­ing a pend­ing court case, an in­tel­lec­tu­ally dis­abled teenager who took part in the Spe­cial Olympics World Games last March com­mit­ted fur­ther of­fences, in­clud­ing per­form­ing an ob­scene act in front of a woman work­ing at his for­mer school.</p>
    <p>The 18-year-old pleaded guilty yes­ter­day to two charges of in­sult­ing a woman’s mod­esty and one count of per­form­ing an ob­scene act in pub­lic.</p>
    <p>The young man had ear­lier ad­mit­ted to one count each of at­tempt­ing to com­mit voyeurism, mo­lesta­tion, ap­pear­ing nude in a pub­lic place and per­form­ing an ob­scene act in front of a woman.</p>
    <p>He can­not be named due to gag or­ders to pro­tect the iden­tity of his vic­tims. De­tails about his par­tic­i­pa­tion in the Games in Abu Dhabi last year also can­not be re­vealed as do­ing so could breach the gag or­ders.</p>
    <p>On June 4, the teenager called the main of­fice line of his for­mer school and asked for a woman who was work­ing there. Iden­ti­fy­ing him­self by an­other name, he told her, among other things, that he wanted to “make sex” with her.</p>
    <p>The teen called again the next day ask­ing for the woman, and iden­ti­fied him­self as “Haiqal”.</p>
    <p>He told her that he wanted to “play sex” and “make sex” with her.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor Phoebe Tan said the phone num­ber used to make the calls was sub­se­quently traced to the teenager.</p>
    <p>On the morn­ing of June 16, the woman was walk­ing along a shel­tered walk­way when she heard a per­son say­ing: “Need help.”</p>
    <p>Turn­ing around, she spot­ted the teen, who rubbed his pri­vate parts over his cloth­ing and ran away.</p>
    <p>She later dis­cov­ered him try­ing to hide in a grass patch, af­ter he called out to her again.</p>
    <p>The young man’s ac­tions are the lat­est in a string of of­fences that he has ad­mit­ted to.</p>
    <p>He was caught per­form­ing a sex­ual act in front of a woman at a Kang Ching Road block of flats in Ta­man Jurong on April 16, 2018.</p>
    <p>In May last year, he was spot­ted run­ning around in the nude at a multi-storey carpark in Tah Ching Road, also in Ta­man Jurong.</p>
    <p>On Oct 14 last year, the teenager was in Keat Hong Close, near Choa Chu Kang Av­enue 6, where he mo­lested a 19-year-old girl. He also at­tempted to peep at a psy­chol­o­gist at his school while she was in the toi­let on Jan 30 this year.</p>
    <p>The teen’s lawyer, Mr Sim Bing Wen, had ear­lier urged the court to put his client on pro­ba­tion.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Dis­trict Judge May Me­se­nas called for a sup­ple­men­tary re­port to de­ter­mine if he is still suit­able for pro­ba­tion.</p>
    <p>His case is ex­pected to be heard again on Dec 7.</p>
