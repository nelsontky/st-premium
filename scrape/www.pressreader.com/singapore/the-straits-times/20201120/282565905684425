    <p>More plant-based items are hit­ting the su­per­mar­ket shelves.</p>
    <p>The lat­est are plant-based Om­niMeat Lun­cheon and pork-like Om­niMeat Strip by foodtech company Om­niFoods, which are avail­able at se­lected FairPrice su­per­mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Din­ers can also head to all 11 Collin’s restau­rants, as well as five Ac­cor Group ho­tels for their fix of Om­niMeat’s lun­cheon meat.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore launch of the two prod­ucts was an­nounced yesterday at a virtual press con­fer­ence by Hong Kong’s plant-based life­style plat­form Green Mon­day Group, which is also cre­ator of Om­niFoods.</p>
    <p>Made of soya beans, wheat, beet­root and co­conut oil, the plant­based lun­cheon meat de­buted in Hong Kong in May. Last month, the prod­uct made head­lines as it was in­cor­po­rated in six dishes at fast-food chain Mc­Don­ald’s Hong Kong and Macau out­lets.</p>
    <p>Co­conut oil is used for the Om­niMeat Lun­cheon, mainly for the aroma when it is be­ing cooked, says Mr David Yeung, founder of Green Mon­day and Om­niFoods.</p>
    <p>The Om­niMeat Strip, on the other hand, con­tains sun­flower oil, and he rec­om­mends that the prod­uct be seasoned or mar­i­nated. It is priced at $6.95 at FairPrice su­per­mar­kets, while the Om­niMeat Lun­cheon re­tails at $8.80.</p>
    <p>The first Om­niFoods prod­uct – Om­niMeat Mince ($6.50), which launched in April 2018 – is also avail­able at FairPrice su­per­mar­kets. From Dec 15, other ma­jor su­per­mar­kets, as well as se­lected plat­forms such as RedMart, will also sell the new prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Not keen on cook­ing the “meat” your­self? Then head to five restau­rants un­der the Ac­cor Group, which will of­fer the Om­niMeat Lun­cheon dishes till Dec 2.</p>
    <p>Try the Om­niMeat Lun­cheon Sando ($22++) from Raf­fles Ho­tel Sin­ga­pore’s Raf­fles Court­yard or go for the Om­niMeat Lun­cheon sushi ($26++) at Fair­mont Sin­ga­pore’s Ja­panese restau­rant Mikuni.</p>
    <p>At Swis­so­tel The Stam­ford, check out the Om­niMeat Lun­cheon burger ($22++) from Clove restau­rant. Swis­so­tel Mer­chant Court’s El­len­bor­ough Mar­ket Cafe of­fers an Om­niMeat Lun­cheon tart­let ($12 nett), while Mer­cure Sin­ga­pore on Stevens’ Wine­stone restau­rant serves an Om­niMeat Lun­cheon tagli­atelle aglio e olio ($30++).</p>
    <p>Local food-and-bev­er­age group Collin’s will also of­fer Om­niMeat Lun­cheon lasagna ($16.80++) and Om­niMeat Lun­cheon Chef Salad ($12.80++) at all of its 11 restau­rants is­land­wide till Jan 31 next year.</p>
    <p>This is the first time the restau­rant group is us­ing plant-based prod­ucts in its dishes.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times had a taste of the two dishes yesterday and the fried plant-based lun­cheon meat in the salad tastes like a less salty ver­sion of the real thing.</p>
    <p>In the lasagna, a layer of the meat works well with the spinach, cheese and cream sauce.</p>
    <p>Aside from the prod­uct launch, Mr Yeung also an­nounced that Green Mon­day Group will open its plant-based con­cept store and cafe Green Com­mon in Jan­uary next year at VivoCity.</p>
    <p>Span­ning more than 3,000 sq ft, the “one-stop hub for a plant­based ex­pe­ri­ence” will show­case a va­ri­ety of plant-based brands in­clud­ing Be­yond, Heura and Al­pha Foods. Green Com­mon has nine lo­ca­tions in Hong Kong and two on­line plat­forms.</p>
    <p>On en­ter­ing the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket, Mr Yeung says: “I am thrilled to bring Om­niMeat Lun­cheon and Om­niMeat Strip for those seeking a health­ier op­tion of their favourite treats. Our stud­ies show that Asians have a great de­mand for tra­di­tional lun­cheon meat and eat it fre­quently.</p>
    <p>“Our ver­sa­tile, plant-based meat al­ter­na­tives are a much kinder op­tion for the planet, as well as for our health.”</p>
