    <p>•</p>
    <p>KUALA LUMPUR Malaysian po­lice ques­tioned Op­po­si­tion Leader An­war Ibrahim yes­ter­day over his push to top­ple the gov­ern­ment and be­come prime min­is­ter, with him slam­ming the probe as “po­lit­i­cal ha­rass­ment”.</p>
    <p>He an­nounced last month that he had gar­nered enough sup­port from MPs to seize power from a shaky, seven-month-old coali­tion led by Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri An­war met the Malaysian King, who ap­points the prime min­is­ter, on Tues­day to make his case, although Tan Sri Muhyid­din has dis­missed his chal­lenge and oth­ers have raised doubts about whether he has the back­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war was seen as the prime min­is­ter-in-wait­ing un­til a re­formist gov­ern­ment, of which he was a lead­ing mem­ber, col­lapsed in Fe­bru­ary amid bitter in­fight­ing.</p>
    <p>Po­lice called Mr An­war in for ques­tion­ing fol­low­ing com­plaints from law­mak­ers whose names were in­cluded in a vi­ral list of those sup­pos­edly back­ing him. Mr An­war said po­lice had asked him to hand over the list of MPs but he re­fused on the grounds that only Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah has a right to see it. “What is mind­bog­gling is that they want the list,” Mr An­war said. “This is an at­tempt by the po­lit­i­cal masters to op­press me – this is ma­li­cious, it is po­lit­i­cal ha­rass­ment.”</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials are in­ves­ti­gat­ing Mr An­war un­der two laws – one against re­marks that are in­tended to cause pub­lic alarm, and another against shar­ing of­fen­sive con­tent.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war has claimed that more than 120 MPs back him to be­come pre­mier and that the King will meet po­lit­i­cal lead­ers to as­sess his claim. A prime min­is­ter must com­mand the sup­port of at least half the MPs in Malaysia’s 222-seat Par­lia­ment.</p>
