    <p>• South Korea and China agreed yes­ter­day to pre­pare for a visit to Seoul by Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping and to co­op­er­ate on re­viv­ing the stalled talks on North Korea’s nu­clear pro­gramme as well as tack­ling the coronaviru­s.</p>
    <p>China’s top diplo­mat Wang Yi ar­rived in the South Korean cap­i­tal late on Wed­nes­day, af­ter a two­day visit to Ja­pan, as Asian gov­ern­ments pre­pare for change un­der a new US ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>“Both sides agreed to ac­tively com­mu­ni­cate so that the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion sta­bilises and con­di­tions are cre­ated for Pres­i­dent Xi’s visit,” the South Korean For­eign Min­istry said af­ter Mr Wang held talks with South Korea’s For­eign Min­is­ter Kang Kyung-wha.</p>
    <p>China and US ally South Korea have tra­di­tion­ally been sus­pi­cious of each other but in re­cent years have found com­mon ground in economic co­op­er­a­tion and a shared con­cern about North Korea’s rush to de­velop nu­clear weapons.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi was ex­pected to visit South Korea early this year but the coronaviru­s epi­demic put plans on hold.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang said his visit was to high­light the im­por­tance of ef­forts by the “strate­gic part­ners” to work to pro­mote peace and sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>“The Covid-19 cri­sis could not de­feat the cit­i­zens of our two coun­tries,” Mr Wang, speak­ing through an in­ter­preter, said as his meet­ing with Ms Kang be­gan.</p>
    <p>“Bi­lat­eral ties are show­ing their strength and ever more vigour.”</p>
    <p>South Korea’s Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in met Mr Wang sep­a­rately and they dis­cussed peace on the penin­sula, Mr Moon’s of­fice said.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump had raised hopes for progress in press­ing North Korea to give up its weapons pro­grammes in ex­change for the lift­ing of sanc­tions but talks with the coun­try’s leader Kim Jong Un stalled.</p>
    <p>Ms Kang ex­changed views on the in­com­ing US ad­min­is­tra­tion with Mr Wang, who ex­pressed “hopes” for its North Korea pol­icy, a South Korean of­fi­cial who de­clined to be iden­ti­fied told re­porters.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang re­it­er­ated China’s op­po­si­tion to a US mis­sile de­fence sys­tem in­stalled in South Korea in 2017, the of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>South Korea and the United States say the sys­tem is de­signed to counter North Korean mis­sile threats but China fears it un­der­cuts its se­cu­rity in­ter­ests.</p>
