    <p>JOHANNESBU­RG • Eng­land’s tour of South Africa has been called off after a Covid-19 scare.</p>
    <p>The joint an­nounce­ment from the two cricket boards, which al­luded to the “men­tal and phys­i­cal health” of the play­ers, came after two mem­bers re­port­edly tested pos­i­tive, forc­ing the scrap­ping of the re­ar­ranged first match in the three-match se­ries last Sun­day.</p>
    <p>While the Eng­land and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) yes­ter­day re­vealed the two un­named in­di­vid­u­als were in fact not in­fected, the three re­main­ing one-day in­ter­na­tion­als have been can­celled.</p>
    <p>The two gov­ern­ing bod­ies will ex­am­ine whether the se­ries can be played at some point in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“The con­cern over the men­tal health im­pact of re­cent events on all in­volved is not one that we as CSA (Cricket South Africa) or the ECB take lightly and the de­ci­sion to post­pone the tour is the most re­spon­si­ble and rea­son­able course of ac­tion for us,” said CSA act­ing chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Ku­gan­drie Goven­der on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to call off the tour fol­lowed ap­par­ent breaches of the bio-se­cure en­vi­ron­ment at the Cape Town ho­tel where both teams were stay­ing. A South African player tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 last Fri­day, fol­lowed by two ho­tel staff mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Eng­land are due to re­turn home on a char­tered flight, but the fail­ure to com­plete the tour marks a blow as cricket at­tempts to carry on in the face of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Eng­land were the first to host over­seas teams, play­ing Test and white-ball se­ries against the West Indies, Pak­istan and Aus­tralia. No cases were re­ported from matches held from July to Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, New Zealand health au­thor­i­ties said the Pak­istan team were free to leave quar­an­tine after the team tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 fol­low­ing the end of their two-week self-iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>After 10 virus cases were de­tected among the 50-strong group, Pak­istan were con­fined to their ho­tel in Christchur­ch but are now free to train ahead of their first Twenty20 match against the Black Caps in Auck­land on Dec 18.</p>
