    <p>Ms Tr­ishi Pravind Kumar might have jumped into in­vest­ing only dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, but she in­tends to stay in it for the long term.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old bank em­ployee said she found her­self with ex­tra time dur­ing Sin­ga­pore’s cir­cuit breaker pe­riod ear­lier this year and started read­ing up on the topic.</p>
    <p>She also watched videos and even at­tended sev­eral on­line sem­i­nars to learn more about the fun­da­men­tals of fi­nan­cial plan­ning and, sub­se­quently, in­vest­ing.</p>
    <p>“I was able to learn and teach my­self about var­i­ous in­vest­ment tools and how they worked, and I got fa­mil­iar with in­vest­ment ter­mi­nol­ogy, which can be in­tim­i­dat­ing at first but is very im­por­tant to an in­vestor. More im­por­tantly, I learnt about con­cepts such as mar­ket cy­cles and in­vest­ment hori­zons, which helped me to de­cide what was best for me,” she said.</p>
    <p>She made her first in­vest­ment move with the DBS In­vest-Saver Plan, which allows in­vestors to put in a fixed monthly sum on re­peat.</p>
    <p>She did not get into eq­ui­ties right away, she said, as that re­quired her to con­sis­tently mon­i­tor in­di­vid­ual stocks on a reg­u­lar ba­sis.</p>
    <p>In­stead, she set up a reg­u­lar sav­ings plan with In­vest-Saver, putting $100 monthly into the Nikko AM SGD in­vest­ment grade cor­po­rate bond ex­change-traded fund (ETF).</p>
    <p>It is an open-end fund in­cor­po­rated in Sin­ga­pore, with an ob­jec­tive of pro­vid­ing in­vestors with re­turns that cor­re­spond closely to the to­tal re­turn of the Straits Times In­dex (STI).</p>
    <p>Ms Tr­ishi also in­vests an­other $100 monthly in the Nikko AM Sin­ga­pore STI ETF.</p>
    <p>She re­cently opened a trad­ing ac­count for in­vest­ment in eq­ui­ties.</p>
    <p>“I feel that this re­quires ex­pe­ri­ence and more knowl­edge,” she said. “Once I gain more knowl­edge about my per­sonal fi­nances and in­vest­ment op­tions, I will then be more con­fi­dent in ac­tively in­vest­ing for my short-term and longer-term plans, such as for re­tire­ment.”</p>
