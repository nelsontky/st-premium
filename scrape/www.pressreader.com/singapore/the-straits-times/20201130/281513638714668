    <p>The post­poned Tokyo 2020 Olympics is set to be­come the sec­ond-most ex­pen­sive Sum­mer Games, as or­gan­is­ers said the de­lay caused by the pan­demic would add about 200 bil­lion yen (S$2.6 bil­lion) to the cost. This fig­ure does not yet in­clude the cost of im­ple­ment­ing Covid-19 safety mea­sures.</p>
    <p>TOKYO • The or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee for the Tokyo Olympics and Par­a­lympics has es­ti­mated the ad­di­tional cost for post­pon­ing the Games to next sum­mer to be about 200 bil­lion yen (S$2.6 bil­lion), Yomi­uri Shim­bun has re­ported.</p>
    <p>The Games’ orig­i­nal cost was 1.35 tril­lion yen (S$17.4 bil­lion) and the com­mit­tee will dis­cuss the plan with the Ja­panese and Tokyo metropoli­tan gov­ern­ments and de­cide next month how to split the cost, the news­pa­per said yes­ter­day, cit­ing uniden­ti­fied</p>
    <p>Olympic of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>The Tokyo Games, which are now set for July 23 to Aug 8 next year, were de­layed by a year due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the first time an Olympics was post­poned.</p>
    <p>Yomi­uri said mem­bers of the or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee had ini­tially voiced con­cern that the ex­tra cost could run to as much as 300 bil­lion yen, but agreed with the In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee to sim­plify as­pects of the Games to save money.</p>
    <p>There will be fewer free tick­ets, while ath­lete wel­come cer­e­monies have been scrapped, with sav­ings on ban­ners, mas­cots and meals.</p>
    <p>The ad­di­tional costs also take into ac­count staff salaries, the re­book­ing of venues, trans­porta­tion, as well as the in­tro­duc­tion of new sys­tems for re­fund­ing tick­ets.</p>
    <p>How­ever, they do not in­clude counter-mea­sures to slow down the spread of Covid-19, as these are pri­mar­ily be­ing han­dled and paid for by the Ja­panese gov­ern­ment, Yomi­uri said.</p>
    <p>The shift to next year has caused lo­gis­ti­cal headaches, but is far less painful than can­celling it, with spon­sors, broad­cast­ers and oth­ers hav­ing in­vested bil­lions of dol­lars into the world’s fore­most sport­ing event.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials of the Tokyo Olympics or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee could not be reached for com­ment, but a se­nior of­fi­cial said last week that Games test events would re­sume in March and a de­ci­sion on fan at­ten­dance will be made i n the spring.</p>
    <p>The 2016 Games i n Rio de Janeiro cost 43.3 bil­lion reais (S$10.9 bil­lion), while the 2012 edi­tion in Lon­don cost £8.92 bil­lion (S$15.9 bil­lion). The 2008 Bei­jing Olympics is still the most ex­pen­sive Sum­mer Games on record at US$40 bil­lion (S$53.5 bil­lion).</p>
