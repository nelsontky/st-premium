    <p>China and the United States are locked in an ugly show­down af­ter US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump re­voked Hong Kong’s spe­cial sta­tus and leg­is­lated sanc­tions, bring­ing fur­ther un­cer­tainty to the fu­ture of the fi­nan­cial cen­tre still reel­ing from months of po­lit­i­cal un­rest last year and the cur­rent pan­demic. Mr Trump’s lat­est moves were met with swift con­dem­na­tion from Bei­jing, which vowed to re­tal­i­ate.</p>
    <p>China and the United States are locked in an ugly show­down af­ter US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump re­voked Hong Kong’s spe­cial sta­tus and leg­is­lated sanc­tions, bring­ing fur­ther un­cer­tainty to the fu­ture of the fi­nan­cial cen­tre still reel­ing from months of po­lit­i­cal un­rest last year and the cur­rent Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s lat­est moves were met with swift con­dem­na­tion from Bei­jing, which vowed to re­tal­i­ate and called the ac­tions a “se­ri­ous vi­o­la­tion of in­ter­na­tional law” and “gross in­ter­fer­ence” in China’s in­ter­nal af­fairs.</p>
    <p>“The US’ at­tempts to ob­struct the im­ple­men­ta­tion of Hong Kong’s na­tional se­cu­rity law will never suc­ceed,” said a state­ment by</p>
    <p>China’s For­eign Min­istry yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“In or­der to safe­guard its own le­git­i­mate in­ter­ests, China will make the nec­es­sary re­sponse and im­pose sanc­tions on rel­e­vant US per­son­nel and en­ti­ties.”</p>
    <p>The US and other lib­eral democ­ra­cies have crit­i­cised the new Hong Kong na­tional se­cu­rity law that Bei­jing pushed through just be­fore the 23rd an­niver­sary of the city’s han­dover by the Bri­tish two weeks ago.</p>
    <p>Un­der the law, any­one charged with sub­ver­sion, se­ces­sion, ter­ror­ism or col­lu­sion with for­eign forces to un­der­mine Hong Kong’s na­tional se­cu­rity faces up to life in prison.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the leg­is­la­tion came into force on July 1, the US al­ready acted to end de­fence ex­ports and sen­si­tive tech­nol­ogy to Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The new Hong Kong Au­ton­omy Act signed into law by Mr Trump on Tues­day tar­gets with sanc­tions those who im­ple­ment the Hong Kong se­cu­rity law. It al­lows the author­i­ties to seize the as­sets of of­fend­ing Chi­nese of­fi­cials and bar their en­try to the US.</p>
    <p>“This law gives my ad­min­is­tra­tion pow­er­ful new tools to hold re­spon­si­ble the in­di­vid­u­als and the en­ti­ties in­volved in ex­tin­guish­ing Hong Kong’s free­dom,” said Mr Trump at a White House press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“We’ve all watched what hap­pened. Not a good sit­u­a­tion. Their free­dom has been taken away. Their rights have been taken away. And with it, goes Hong Kong, in my opin­ion, be­cause it will no longer be able to com­pete with free mar­kets.”</p>
    <p>He also signed an ex­ec­u­tive or­der tak­ing away Hong Kong’s spe­cial trading sta­tus with the US, say­ing Hong Kong will now be treated the same as main­land China.</p>
    <p>“No spe­cial priv­i­leges, no spe­cial eco­nomic treat­ment and no ex­port of sen­si­tive tech­nolo­gies.”</p>
    <p>The ex­tra­di­tion deal with Hong Kong and train­ing for its po­lice also come to an end. Li­cence ex­cep­tions for ex­ports to the city will be re­voked and of­fi­cials said it will now be treated like any other city in China.</p>
    <p>Since 1992, the US has recog­nised Hong Kong as a semi-au­ton­o­mous city with its own le­gal and eco­nomic sys­tems in­de­pen­dent of main­land China.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong shares ended flat yes­ter­day on news of the puni­tive moves, with the Hang Seng In­dex up by 3.69 points, or 0.01 per cent.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton has been hard­en­ing its stance to­wards Bei­jing in re­cent months over the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, Xin­jiang, the South China Sea and Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, it is­sued its tough­est po­si­tion yet on the dis­pute over the re­gional wa­ters, declar­ing China’s claims over vast swathes of the sea “com­pletely un­law­ful”, while warn­ing of sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, for­eign min­istry spokesman Hua Chun­y­ing made light of US threats of sanc­tions, say­ing that China was not afraid. “If the US in­sists on mak­ing waves, then let the storms be­come more vi­o­lent,” she said.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has been fight­ing fires on sev­eral diplo­matic fronts in the past week. On Tues­day, Bri­tain de­cided to ban Chi­nese tech gi­ant Huawei from its 5G net­work, draw­ing sharp re­buke from China, which has ac­cused the United King­dom of politi­cis­ing busi­ness and tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The United States’ pol­icy shift on China’s claims in the South China Sea – re­ject­ing them as il­le­gal un­der in­ter­na­tional law – may pave the way for more force­ful re­sponses from Wash­ing­ton over Chi­nese mar­itime ac­tiv­i­ties in the con­tested wa­ters, said an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>Amer­ica’s strong stance on the is­sue could also en­cour­age South-east Asian claimant coun­tries to stand up to China, al­though there are lim­its to do­ing so, the an­a­lysts added.</p>
    <p>“The most im­me­di­ate ef­fect of this pol­icy change will be on the diplo­matic front. It is much eas­ier to rally in­ter­na­tional sup­port against ‘il­le­gal’ ac­tiv­ity than against ac­tions that are merely dis­taste­ful or desta­bil­is­ing,” Mr Greg Pol­ing, a se­nior fel­low at the Wash­ing­ton-based Cen­tre for Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies (CSIS) and di­rec­tor of its Asia Mar­itime Trans­parency Ini­tia­tive, wrote in a com­men­tary on the think-tank’s web­site.</p>
    <p>He said US of­fi­cials are likely to start to work this stronger lan­guage into state­ments at in­ter­na­tional fo­rums, and put pres­sure on part­ners and al­lies to do the same.</p>
    <p>Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo on Mon­day is­sued a state­ment for­mally re­ject­ing most of China’s claims to the South China Sea and call­ing them il­le­gal, in line with an in­ter­na­tional ar­bi­tral tri­bunal’s rul­ing in 2016.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton’s des­ig­na­tion of China’s mar­itime ac­tiv­i­ties in the South China Sea as il­le­gal could jus­tify po­ten­tial sanc­tions against Chi­nese com­pa­nies and en­ti­ties, Mr Pol­ing noted.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a CSIS we­bi­nar on Tues­day, when asked if sanc­tions were an op­tion, US As­sis­tant Sec­re­tary of State for East Asian and Pa­cific Af­fairs David Stil­well replied that noth­ing was off the ta­ble.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton’s move might also en­cour­age claimant states in South-east Asia, par­tic­u­larly Viet­nam and the Philip­pines, to ad­vo­cate for them­selves more force­fully against China, said Mr Pol­ing and other an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>Manila-based aca­demic Richard Javad Hey­dar­ian said: “There is re­sis­tance, but it’s di­vided re­sis­tance. There’s push­back, but there’s no cen­tre of grav­ity.</p>
    <p>“The Pom­peo state­ment is cre­at­ing some sort of pa­ram­e­ters in how the US could be more help­ful in ways it was not.”</p>
    <p>Dr Nguyen Hung Son, di­rec­tor-gen­eral of the East Sea In­sti­tute at the Diplo­matic Academy of Viet­nam, said: “I hope that this state­ment by the US is go­ing to give con­fi­dence to other coun­tries in sup­port of the rules-based or­der, and give Asean the con­fi­dence to in­vest on the rules-based or­der and put ef­fort into sup­port­ing the (United</p>
    <p>Na­tions Con­ven­tion on the) Law of the Sea and en­forc­ing it.”</p>
    <p>At Tues­day’s CSIS event, Dr Nguyen and other South-east Asia-based an­a­lysts said they in­ter­preted the US state­ment as a clar­i­fi­ca­tion of Wash­ing­ton’s stance, rather than a ma­jor shift in pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Hey­dar­ian: “We don’t see it as a cyn­i­cal ploy dur­ing an elec­tion where (Pres­i­dent Don­ald) Trump wants to look good by bash­ing China. We see it as a log­i­cal pro­gres­sion in terms of the in­creas­ingly tough stance of the US in the South China Sea.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, it was im­por­tant for the US not to en­gage in pure China-bash­ing and close off di­a­logue, he said.</p>
    <p>“That doesn’t work for a lot of us. China is our neigh­bour, it’s like fam­ily, you can­not choose them, you have to deal with them. China is also giv­ing us a lot of ben­e­fits the US can­not pro­vide, so the US has to be re­al­is­tic,” said Mr Hey­dar­ian.</p>
    <p>He urged the US to pro­vide lead­er­ship that “gal­vanises the re­gion” to cre­ate a coali­tion that would de­ter China, rather than a new Cold War which would be in­ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there was also a good chance that Wash­ing­ton’s state­ment could raise ten­sions in the short term, said an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>A more force­ful US re­sponse might lead China to dou­ble down out of a sense of na­tion­al­ism, said Mr Pol­ing.</p>
    <p>Eura­sia Group an­a­lysts said in a note on Tues­day that Mr Pom­peo’s state­ment will ran­kle Bei­jing, which has been no­tably more ag­gres­sive in its claims over the past year.</p>
    <p>“In a pe­riod of ris­ing na­tion­al­ism on both sides, the Chi­nese navy could use this an­nounce­ment as an ex­cuse to be even more as­sertive,” they wrote.</p>
