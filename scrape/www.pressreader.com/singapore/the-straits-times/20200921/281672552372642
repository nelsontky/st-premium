    <p>De­mand for clean­ing and dis­in­fec­tion ser­vices has dou­bled for A1 Fa­cil­ity Ser­vices amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness is so good that 29-year-old founder and di­rec­tor Bryan Goh has stepped in to do the work him­self on a few oc­ca­sions, largely be­cause he can­not get enough work­ers.</p>
    <p>The com­pany, which has seen its rev­enue in­crease by 30 per cent, has tried to hire more Sin­ga­pore­ans by putting up more job ads, but some of those who are em­ployed “go miss­ing” af­ter a while, he said.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, com­pany staff who are in man­age­ment roles, such as the gen­eral man­ager of op­er­a­tions, have had to step in to com­plete the jobs, said Mr Goh.</p>
    <p>The com­pany cur­rently em­ploys be­tween 100 and 200 staff, but is still fac­ing a man­power short­age, said Mr Goh.</p>
    <p>“Due to Covid-19, peo­ple want more dis­in­fec­tion ser­vices and they want their place to be cleaned more fre­quently. Ex­ist­ing clients are also in­creas­ing their clean­ing fre­quency,” he said.</p>
    <p>“One of our clients, Gym Pod, used to ask for clean­ing twice a week, but now, they are ask­ing for daily clean­ing, which is four times more.”</p>
    <p>More man­power is needed in such cases, but with the bor­der closed and the com­pany un­able to hire more for­eign work­ers, the com­pany has no choice but to charge clients more, said Mr Goh.</p>
    <p>“We don’t have enough man­power to keep up with the de­mand,” he said.</p>
