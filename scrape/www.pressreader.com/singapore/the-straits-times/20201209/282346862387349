    <p>• Three un­named mem­bers of the Toronto Rap­tors have tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 dur­ing the league-man­dated test­ing pe­riod be­fore train­ing camp, the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) team said on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The Rap­tors, who last year be­came the first Cana­dian team to win the cham­pi­onship, did not iden­tify the in­di­vid­u­als but said all three were in quar­an­tine and away from the rest of the or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“Ad­her­ence to pro­to­cols, fol­lowup test­ing and con­tact trac­ing has so far re­vealed no spread to other mem­bers of the Rap­tors or­gan­i­sa­tion,” the team said.</p>
    <p>They also can­celled me­dia ac­cess to head coach Nick Nurse and All-Star guard Kyle Lowry.</p>
    <p>Many are ex­pect­ing a spike in Covid-19 cases this sea­son with the NBA, which be­gins on Dec 22, re­vert­ing to its usual home and away for­mat in­stead of the bub­ble in Or­lando, Florida, last term.</p>
    <p>Rap­tors gen­eral man­ager Bobby Webster said that the clus­ter was “bound to hap­pen”.</p>
    <p>“It’s a lo­gis­ti­cal chal­lenge, it’s a health chal­lenge, it’s a hu­man chal­lenge that we’re all go­ing through,” he told The Toronto Star news­pa­per. “It’s con­stantly on our mind. At the same time, we’re try­ing to pre­pare for an NBA sea­son.”</p>
    <p>The Rap­tors will start the sea­son based in Tampa, Florida, due to travel re­stric­tions im­posed by the Cana­dian gov­ern­ment. They will host the New Or­leans Pel­i­cans on Dec 23 in their first game.</p>
    <p>Apart from the health risks, the pan­demic has also wreaked havoc on teams’ fi­nances.</p>
    <p>The start of next sea­son will be a closed-door af­fair, as was the case when the league re­sumed in July fol­low­ing a four-month hia­tus.</p>
    <p>With ticket sales mak­ing up 40 per cent of rev­enue, the league is plan­ning to dole out US$30 mil­lion (S$40 mil­lion) per team, a US$900 mil­lion to­tal, to aid with liq­uid­ity is­sues, Sports Busi­ness Jour­nal re­ported on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The money has been raised from notes is­sued by the NBA in the pri­vate place­ment mar­ket, and while the league will pay it back via “gen­eral col­lec­tive league sources”, it is un­clear what the in­ter­est rate will be.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to ESPN, the NBA’s rev­enue fell by 10 per cent to US$8.3 bil­lion for the 2019-20 sea­son be­cause of the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>It’s a lo­gis­ti­cal chal­lenge, it’s a health chal­lenge, it’s a hu­man chal­lenge that we’re all go­ing through.</p>
