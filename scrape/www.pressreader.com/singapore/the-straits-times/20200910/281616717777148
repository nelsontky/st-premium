    <p>Keep­ing Up With The Kar­dashi­ans, the Amer­i­can tele­vi­sion re­al­ity show that shot Kim Kar­dashian (be­low) and her fam­ily to fame, is end­ing next year af­ter 14 years. It helped make her and her sib­lings Kylie, Ken­dall, Khloe and Kourt­ney house­hold names and launched their ca­reers in the fash­ion and beauty busi­ness. The show will air its last sea­son early next year.</p>
    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • The Amer­i­can tele­vi­sion re­al­ity show that shot Kim Kar­dashian and her fam­ily to fame is end­ing next year af­ter 14 years, the E! net­work said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Keep­ing Up With The Kar­dashi­ans, which helped make Kim Kar­dashian and her sib­lings Kylie, Ken­dall, Khloe and Kourt­ney house­hold names and l aunched their ca­reers in the fash­ion and beauty busi­ness, will air its last sea­son early next year, the net­work and ex­tended fam­ily said.</p>
    <p>“It is with heavy hearts that we say good­bye to Keep­ing Up With The Kar­dashi­ans. Af­ter what will be 14 years, 20 sea­sons, hun­dreds of episodes and sev­eral spin-off shows, we’ve de­cided as a fam­ily to end this very spe­cial jour­ney,” the fam­ily said on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>They gave no rea­sons for the de­ci­sion, but E! said in a state­ment that it re­spected “the fam­ily’s de­ci­sion to live their lives with­out our cam­eras”.</p>
    <p>Keep­ing Up With The Kar­dashi­ans made its de­but in 2012 and spawned 12 spin-off se­ries. Au­di­ences have de­clined in re­cent years to un­der one mil­lion from about four mil­lion at the height of the show’s fame. E! is part of NBC Uni­ver­sal, a unit of Com­cast.</p>
    <p>The show chron­i­cled the per­sonal and pro­fes­sional lives of the Cal­i­for­nian fam­ily, in­clud­ing Kim Kar­dashian’s mar­riage to rap­per Kanye West, an armed rob­bery in Paris, Khloe Kar­dashian’s split with bas­ket­ball player La­mar Odom and the tran­si­tion of fam­ily pa­tri­arch Bruce Jen­ner to Cait­lyn Jen­ner.</p>
    <p>It helped Kim Kar­dashian launch a beauty and shapewear line, launched the mod­el­ling ca­reer of her half-sis­ter Ken­dall Jen­ner and helped pro­mote a lip-gloss busi­ness that turned half-sis­ter Kylie Jen­ner into a bil­lion­aire at the age of 21.</p>
    <p>“This show made us who we are and I will be for­ever in debt to ev­ery­one who played a role in shap­ing our ca­reers and chang­ing our lives for­ever,” Kim Kar­dashian said in a post­ing to her 188 mil­lion In­sta­gram fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>Kim Kar­dashian’s life has re­cently taken a more se­ri­ous turn, with her de­ci­sion to train as a lawyer and to lobby for crim­i­naljus­tice re­form.</p>
    <p>In 2018, she per­son­ally lob­bied United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump to com­mute the sen­tence of a 63-year-old wo­man, Alice Marie John­son, who was serv­ing life in prison for a non-vi­o­lent drug con­vic­tion. Mr Trump par­doned John­son af­ter the Repub­li­can Na­tional Con­ven­tion.</p>
