    <p>Speak­ing yes­ter­day at this year’s mass call to ad­mit new lawyers, Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon en­cour­aged those en­ter­ing the pro­fes­sion to con­sider how tech­nol­ogy can im­prove ef­fi­ciency in the de­liv­ery of le­gal ser­vices. This is the first time the an­nual cer­e­mony is be­ing con­ducted re­motely.</p>
    <p>In a time of eco­nomic un­cer­tainty caused by the pan­demic, lawyers who can come up with in­no­va­tive so­lu­tions to im­prove ef­fi­ciency and re­duce costs to meet clients’ needs will gain a com­pet­i­tive edge.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing yes­ter­day at this year’s mass call to ad­mit new lawyers, Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon en­cour­aged those en­ter­ing the pro­fes­sion to con­sider how tech­nol­ogy can im­prove ef­fi­ciency in the de­liv­ery of le­gal ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“You are well placed to of­fer fresh per­spec­tives and cre­ative ideas that may not oc­cur to those of us ac­cus­tomed to the old ways of do­ing things,” he said.</p>
    <p>This is the first time the an­nual cer­e­mony is be­ing con­ducted re­motely.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, 528 ap­pli­cants are be­ing called to the Bar over four video­con­fer­enc­ing ses­sions held yes­ter­day and today.</p>
    <p>In his speech, CJ Menon en­cour­aged the newly minted lawyers to boldly confront the chal­lenges brought by the coronaviru­s pan­demic and to take ad­van­tage of new op­por­tu­ni­ties that will emerge.</p>
    <p>“While some of you may find that the com­mence­ment of your ca­reer as a prac­tis­ing lawyer is far re­moved from any­thing that you might have imag­ined upon your grad­u­a­tion from law school, you can be as­sured that this pan­demic – like the nu­mer­ous chal­lenges you have al­ready faced – will even­tu­ally pass.”</p>
    <p>Law firms have im­ple­mented wage cuts and “con­cern­ing” fig­ures in­di­cate that re­cent law grad­u­ates may have trou­ble find­ing em­ploy­ment, he said.</p>
    <p>Out of 373 of the new lawyers who re­sponded to a sur­vey, about 19 per cent re­ported they were still look­ing for a job.</p>
    <p>How­ever, CJ Menon said there are signs of op­por­tu­ni­ties for le­gal pro­fes­sion­als in the midst of cri­sis.</p>
    <p>In-house lawyers have re­ported grow­ing de­mand for ad­vice on mat­ters re­lated to cri­sis man­age­ment, rene­go­ti­a­tion of con­tracts and em­ploy­ment-re­lated mat­ters.</p>
    <p>There has also been a re­ported surge in le­gal work in ar­eas such as in­sol­vency and re­struc­tur­ing, reg­u­la­tory com­pli­ance, lit­i­ga­tion and em­ploy­ment law.</p>
    <p>He urged lawyers to be pre­pared to turn to ar­eas of prac­tice that are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a spike in de­mand.</p>
    <p>Look­ing back at the fi­nan­cial crises of past decades, CJ Menon said the les­son to be drawn is that a fu­ture – usu­ally brighter – lies beyond the storm.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the most en­dur­ing legacy of Covid-19 for the courts and the le­gal pro­fes­sion, he said, will be the shift to­wards re­mote hear­ings. Just a few months ago, many would have re­jected the no­tion of non-phys­i­cal courts.</p>
    <p>Today, re­mote hear­ings have largely proven to be con­ve­nient and ef­fec­tive in main­tain­ing a good level of ac­cess to jus­tice dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Touch­ing on the im­por­tance of learn­ing from judges and se­nior lawyers, Law So­ci­ety pres­i­dent Gre­gory Vi­jayen­dran said the so­ci­ety has schemes for se­nior lawyers to of­fer guidance to younger pro­fes­sion­als, as well as a “re­verse men­tor­ship” for ju­niors to coach se­niors on tech adop­tion.</p>
    <p>One of the lawyers called to the Bar this year is Mr Alexan­der Joseph Woon, 30, whose fa­ther is law pro­fes­sor and for­mer at­tor­ney­gen­eral Wal­ter Woon.</p>
    <p>A Pres­i­dent’s Scholar, the younger Mr Woon spent four years as a deputy public prose­cu­tor work­ing mostly on white col­lar and tech­nol­ogy crime.</p>
    <p>He is now a se­nior as­sis­tant di­rec­tor at the Of­fice of Trans­for­ma­tion and In­no­va­tion, an arm of the ju­di­ciary tasked with co­or­di­nat­ing and driv­ing change.</p>
    <p>He told The Straits Times that his fa­ther never ex­pressed any de­sire for him to study law, al­though he reck­oned there was some “pas­sive in­flu­ence”, as he grew up hear­ing about his fa­ther’s work.</p>
    <p>“My de­ci­sion to study law was more a re­sult of my in­ter­est in crim­i­nal law, which is a very dif­fer­ent field from my fa­ther’s spe­cial­ity area, com­pany law,” he said.</p>
