    <p>Even as the likes of Manch­ester City, Manch­ester United and Chelsea look set to dive into the trans­fer mar­ket af­ter be­ing left in the dust in this sea­son’s English Premier League ti­tle race, cham­pi­ons Liver­pool be­lieve their jig­saw puz­zle is al­ready com­plete.</p>
    <p>In a vir­tual press con­fer­ence with global me­dia ahead of to­day’s league game against Chelsea, who are third and 30 points adrift, Liver­pool man­ager Jur­gen Klopp in­sisted he was “happy with my squad 100 per cent”.</p>
    <p>The 53-year-old Ger­man cited how the Reds did not panic buy af­ter los­ing last sea­son’s cham­pi­onship to City by just a point de­spite a 97-point haul, and touched on the fi­nan­cial im­pact of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, which will af­fect the trans­fer mar­ket.</p>
    <p>He added: “It is not that we think we can­not im­prove on a trans­fer ba­sis, we just do what is pos­si­ble for us.</p>
    <p>“The main dif­fer­ence be­tween us and other teams this year is con­sis­tency... I don’t know if you can buy that on the trans­fer mar­ket. We had to build that as well, so that needed time ob­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>“It is not about spend­ing, it is about hav­ing the right team based on your own sit­u­a­tion. We can­not buy be­cause other teams buy, we can­not buy be­cause ev­ery­body wants us to. We can buy if we have the money and the need. If one of these is not there, we will not.”</p>
    <p>It was clear that Klopp, who has brought in 34 play­ers since tak­ing the reins at Liver­pool in 2015, rel­ished the achieve­ment of build­ing this side as the Reds fi­nally get their hands on the league tro­phy at An­field to­day af­ter a 30-year wait.</p>
    <p>While he beamed with pride when asked about how one of the cheaper buys in his first team – left-back Andy Robert­son was signed from Hull City in 2017 for £8 mil­lion (S$14.1 mil­lion) – has flour­ished, Klopp looked equally pleased when The Straits Times asked for his pick for this year’s PFA Player of the Year.</p>
    <p>In­deed, while Mo­hamed Salah, Sa­dio Mane and Roberto Firmino have plun­dered goals thanks to fly­ing full-backs Trent Alexan­der-Arnold and Robert­son, goal­keeper Alis­son and cen­tre-back Vir­gil van Dijk have been colos­sal in de­fence.</p>
    <p>And there are un­sung but in­flu­en­tial heroes such as skip­per Jor­dan Hen­der­son, one of the favourites along­side Manch­ester City’s Kevin de Bruyne to win the pres­ti­gious ac­co­lade on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>With a laugh, Klopp said: “Thank God I don’t make this de­ci­sion! My job is to bring as many play­ers as pos­si­ble to the elec­tion and we have a few, which is very good.</p>
    <p>“I am re­ally happy with the sea­son we played, and that is only pos­si­ble be­cause the play­ers had an in­cred­i­ble sea­son, all of them. And so, I’m very pleased that it is not 100 per cent clear who will be the PFA Player of the Year, but there will be Liver­pool play­ers around I’m pretty sure.”</p>
