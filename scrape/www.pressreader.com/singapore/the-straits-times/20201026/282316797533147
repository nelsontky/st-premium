    <p>•</p>
    <p>HONG KONG China’s Ant Group could raise up to US$17.3 bil­lion (S$23.5 bil­lion) in the Shang­hai leg of the likely US$35 bil­lion dual list­ing, the world’s largest ever, af­ter some large in­vestors sub­mit­ted bids in the range of 68-69 yuan per share, peo­ple with knowl­edge of the mat­ter said.</p>
    <p>The si­mul­ta­ne­ous list­ing in Hong Kong and Shang­hai of the Chi­nese fi­nan­cial tech­nol­ogy gi­ant, backed by e-com­merce be­he­moth Alibaba, would beat the pre­vi­ous largest ini­tial public of­fer­ing (IPO), Saudi Aramco’s US$29.4 bil­lion float last De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>The pric­ing for the Shang­hai tranche was de­cided last Fri­day, said Alibaba founder Jack Ma the next day, with­out dis­clos­ing the price. “It’s the first time the pric­ing of such a big list­ing – the largest in hu­man his­tory – has been deter­mined out­side New York City,” he told the Bund Sum­mit in the east­ern fi­nan­cial hub of Shang­hai, re­fer­ring to Ant’s float as a “mir­a­cle”.</p>
    <p>Later on Satur­day, a per­son with di­rect knowl­edge of the mat­ter told Reuters that many large Chi­nese fund man­agers had bid for Ant shares in the list­ing on the Nas­daq-style Star Mar­ket in Shang­hai at close to 69 yuan apiece.</p>
    <p>At 69 yuan per share, Ant could raise up to 115.3 bil­lion yuan (S$24 bil­lion) in the Shang­hai tranche, valu­ing the com­pany as a whole at up to 2.1 tril­lion yuan, be­fore a 15 per cent green­shoe or over-al­lot­ment op­tion is ex­er­cised.</p>
    <p>Un­der lo­cal mar­ket rules, the fi­nal price for the IPO, which would also be the first dual-list­ing in Hong Kong and on the year-old Star, is based on guid­ance from large in­vestors.</p>
    <p>The peo­ple de­clined to be named</p>
    <p>as they were not au­tho­rised to speak to the me­dia. Ant de­clined to com­ment on the pric­ing.</p>
    <p>The IPO would bur­nish the Shang­hai-based ex­change’s sta­tus as a fast-grow­ing cen­tre for cap­i­tal mar­kets, at a time when ris­ing ten</p>
    <p>sions between China and the US have trig­gered con­cerns about the prospects of list­ing of Chi­nese com­pa­nies in New York.</p>
    <p>Ant has cho­sen the stock code 688688 for its Shang­hai list­ing, which for Chi­nese speak­ers com</p>
    <p>bines two of the most aus­pi­cious numbers, to­gether sym­bol­is­ing long-last­ing pros­per­ity and good for­tune in Chi­nese cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Books for the Shang­hai leg of the float will open for one day to­day.</p>
    <p>Ant plans to sell up to 1.67 bil­lion</p>
    <p>shares in the Shang­hai float, which is set to be the big­gest IPO in China, eclips­ing the record set by Agri­cul­tural Bank of China’s US$10.1 bil­lion Shang­hai float in 2010, ac­cord­ing to Refini­tiv data.</p>
