    <p>ECO­NOMIC CON­SE­QUENCES</p>
    <p>JO­HOR BARU • The Malaysian state of Jo­hor wants the fed­eral au­thor­i­ties in Pu­tra­jaya to speed up the full re­open­ing of the coun­try’s bor­der with Sin­ga­pore, says Menteri Be­sar Hasni Mo­ham­mad.</p>
    <p>Datuk Hasni said he re­cently met Malaysia’s Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin to dis­cuss the mat­ter, adding that the Premier had asked Se­nior Min­is­ter (Se­cu­rity Clus­ter) Is­mail Sabri Yaakob to look into it.</p>
    <p>“Both gov­ern­ments are cur­rently find­ing pos­i­tive ways so that we can quickly open up the bor­der be­tween Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore,” said Mr Hasni, dur­ing the Jo­hor Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil za­kat hand­ing-over cer­e­mony on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>He added that to date, more than 35,000 Jo­hor res­i­dents work­ing in Sin­ga­pore have lost their jobs since the coro­n­avirus pan­demic started.</p>
    <p>Mr Hasni said: “It has also af­fected more than 250,000 Malaysians who used to travel daily across the bor­der, as the state’s econ­omy de­pends on the econ­omy of our neigh­bour­ing coun­try.</p>
    <p>“The bor­der re­open­ing is also im­por­tant as it con­trib­utes 50 per cent of the Cus­toms rev­enue to the coun­try.”</p>
    <p>He said he hopes the gov­ern­ment would an­nounce good news soon.</p>
    <p>On July 26, For­eign Min­is­ter Hisham­mud­din Hus­sein and his Sin­ga­pore coun­ter­part Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan met at the half­way mark of the Cause­way in a sym­bolic ges­ture to mark the agree­ment by both coun­tries to re­open their bor­ders on Aug 17 un­der the Re­cip­ro­cal Green Lane and Pe­ri­odic Com­mut­ing Ar­range­ment (PCA) schemes.</p>
    <p>The bor­der was closed af­ter Malaysia in­tro­duced a move­ment con­trol or­der to curb the spread of Covid-19 on March 18.</p>
    <p>The green lane will en­able cross­bor­der travel for es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial pur­poses be­tween Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore up to a max­i­mum of 400 peo­ple a week for stays of up to two weeks.</p>
    <p>The PCA will al­low res­i­dents of both coun­tries who hold long-term im­mi­gra­tion passes for busi­ness and work pur­poses in the other coun­try to en­ter that coun­try for work, up to a max­i­mum of 2,000 peo­ple a day.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din last week ex­pressed his hope that pro­ce­dures for al­low­ing work­ers to re­sume com­mut­ing daily be­tween Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore can be fi­nalised soon. He said this was among is­sues dis­cussed dur­ing a courtesy call by Sin­ga­pore’s High Com­mis­sioner to Malaysia, Mr Vanu Gopala Menon, on the Malaysian Premier at his of­fice in Pu­tra­jaya last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“I hope Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore would quickly fi­nalise the stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures re­lat­ing to the pro­posal to al­low the daily com­mut­ing of work­ers be­tween both coun­tries, in line with ef­forts to boost the na­tional econ­omy and help the work­ers who have been af­fected,” Tan Sri Muhyid­din said in a Face­book post last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic, more than 300,000 trav­ellers used the Cause­way ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>There are two land cross­ings be­tween Jo­hor and Sin­ga­pore – the Cause­way in Wood­lands and the Sec­ond Link in Tuas.</p>
    <p>It has also af­fected more than 250,000 Malaysians who used to travel daily across the bor­der, as the state’s econ­omy de­pends on the econ­omy of our neigh­bour­ing coun­try. The bor­der re­open­ing is also im­por­tant as it con­trib­utes 50 per cent of the Cus­toms rev­enue to the coun­try.</p>
