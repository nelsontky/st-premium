    <p>NEW YORK • The United States should ratchet up its de­mands on China to in­clude equal ac­cess for com­pa­nies and me­dia, stricter mon­i­tor­ing of Bei­jing’s ac­tiv­i­ties at the United Na­tions, and pre­ven­tive ac­tion to safe­guard Amer­i­can in­ter­ests i n tech­nol­ogy and fi­nance, a bi­par­ti­san panel has told Congress.</p>
    <p>A 575-page re­port by the USChina Eco­nomic and Se­cu­rity Re­view Com­mis­sion – cre­ated by Congress to track and an­tic­i­pate threats from China – char­ac­terised the world’s sec­ond­largest econ­omy as a threat to the cur­rent in­ter­na­tional or­der that has Amer­i­can val­ues at its core.</p>
    <p>It added that China’s lead­ers view those val­ues as a bar­rier to the coun­try’s external am­bi­tions and an ex­is­ten­tial threat to their rule.</p>
    <p>“Chi­nese lead­ers’ as­sess­ment of the United States as a dan­ger­ous and firmly com­mit­ted op­po­nent has in­formed nearly ev­ery facet of China’s diplo­matic strat­egy, eco­nomic pol­icy and mil­i­tary plan­ning in the post-Cold War era,” the panel said.</p>
    <p>Amid a con­tin­u­ing US ef­fort to roll back China’s dom­i­nance in next-gen­er­a­tion 5G com­mu­ni­ca­tions, the role of tech­nol­ogy emerges as a clear theme through­out the an­nual re­port.</p>
    <p>The study said Bei­jing uses the es­tab­lish­ment of tech­ni­cal stan­dards as a way to “ad­vance an al­ter­na­tive tech­no­log­i­cal or­der”. It also warned that China’s ef­fort at fi­nan­cial open­ing was part of a “cal­cu­lated strat­egy” to se­cure for­eign in­vest­ment in­flows and use them to shore up the do­mes­tic econ­omy. This would i ncrease ex­po­sure to unique risks in China’s fi­nan­cial sys­tem for for­eign in­vestors, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>“China is an ad­ver­sary pre­sent­ing unique and im­me­di­ate threats to our eco­nomic and se­cu­rity in­ter­ests,” Mr Robin Cleve­land, chair­man of the com­mis­sion, said i n an open­ing state­ment on Tues­day. He said the re­port re­flected “an un­der­stand­ing that the chal­lenges posed by the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party are not par­ti­san – they are Amer­i­can con­cerns”.</p>
    <p>The anal­y­sis also looked at ar­eas in­clud­ing mil­i­tary ca­pa­bil­i­ties, trade re­la­tions, pub­lic health and Covid-19-re­lated is­sues, as well as Tai­wan and Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing’s na­tional se­cu­rity law for the for­mer Bri­tish colony had “sig­nif­i­cantly com­pro­mised” the rule of law and press free­dom, the re­port found.</p>
    <p>“Un­der grow­ing pres­sure from the CCP, the ter­ri­tory’s ju­di­cial sys­tem has been thrown into cri­sis as judges are com­pelled to adopt main­land le­gal prin­ci­ples and CCP po­si­tions,” the re­port said, re­fer­ring to the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party.</p>
    <p>Last year, in re­sponse to a sim­i­lar re­port from the com­mis­sion, then For­eign Min­istry spokesman Geng Shuang said the panel was “deeply en­trenched in prej­u­dice against China”, adding that its re­ports were “rarely based on facts”.</p>
    <p>A state­ment yes­ter­day from Hong Kong’s gov­ern­ment de­scribed the re­port as “yet another ex­am­ple” of US in­ter­fer­ence in Hong Kong’s af­fairs, us­ing “democ­racy and self­de­ter­mi­na­tion as an ex­cuse”.</p>
    <p>The state­ment con­tin­ued, say­ing that “such ground­less and un­just po­lit­i­cal ma­noeu­vres will achieve noth­ing” but un­der­mine Hong Kong-US re­la­tions and hurt the US’ own in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>Com­pe­ti­tion be­tween the US and China had in­ten­si­fied un­der the lead­er­ship of Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, the au­thors of the US re­port wrote, and they ar­gued that the time for ac­tion is now.</p>
    <p>“If Bei­jing suc­ceeds in nor­mal­is­ing its views of gov­er­nance, the re­sult could un­der­mine in­di­vid­ual rights around the world,” the com­mis­sion said.</p>
