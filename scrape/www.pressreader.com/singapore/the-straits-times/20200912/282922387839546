    <p>BEIJING • The Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties have told ma­jor me­dia out­lets not to cover Walt Dis­ney’s re­lease of Mu­lan, in an or­der is­sued af­ter con­tro­versy erupted over­seas over the film’s links with the Xin­jiang re­gion, four peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter told Reuters.</p>
    <p>Open­ing in lo­cal theatres yes­ter­day, Dis­ney had high hopes for Mu­lan in China, but starv­ing it of public­ity in the coun­try’s strictly cen­sored me­dia would be another blow to the US$200 mil­lion (S$273 mil­lion) pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>Star­ring big-name eth­nic Chi­nese ac­tors – Jet Li, Gong Li, Don­nie Yen and Liu Yifei – and based on a Chi­nese folk story, Mu­lan was tai­lored to ap­peal to au­di­ences in China, the world’s sec­ond-largest movie mar­ket.</p>
    <p>But mixed reviews on­line and ca­pac­ity lim­its in theatres due to coronaviru­s preven­tion mea­sures were likely to weigh on its box-of­fice per­for­mance, even be­fore ma­jor me­dia out­lets re­ceived a no­tice telling them to re­frain from cov­er­ing the movie.</p>
    <p>Three sources told Reuters that me­dia out­lets had re­ceived the no­tice, two of whom said it was sent by the Cy­berspace Ad­min­is­tra­tion of China. A fourth source at a ma­jor Chi­nese news­pa­per said he re­ceived a text mes­sage with a sim­i­lar or­der from a se­nior col­league.</p>
    <p>No rea­son was given in the no­tice, but the sources said they be­lieved it was be­cause of the over­seas back­lash over the film’s links to Xin­jiang.</p>
    <p>Partly shot in Xin­jiang, Mu­lan’s cred­its in­cluded thanks to the au­thor­i­ties there, which prompted calls over­seas for a boy­cott of the movie. China’s treat­ment of eth­nic Uighurs and other Mus­lims in Xin­jiang has been crit­i­cised by some govern­ments, in­clud­ing the United States, and hu­man rights groups.</p>
    <p>Dis­ney ac­knowl­edged on Thurs­day that the de­ci­sion to shoot some scenes of Mu­lan in Xin­jiang has “gen­er­ated a lot of is­sues for us”.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer Chris­tine McCarthy, who spoke at a Bank of Amer­ica con­fer­ence, noted that Mu­lan was mostly shot in New Zealand, but that 20 lo­ca­tions in China were used to show­case “some of the unique land­scapes”.</p>
    <p>Film­ing in Chi­nese lo­ca­tions was “an ef­fort to ac­cu­rately de­pict some of the unique land­scape and geog­ra­phy of the coun­try for this his­tor­i­cal pe­riod piece,” she said. “It has gen­er­ated a lot of public­ity. Let’s leave it at that.”</p>
