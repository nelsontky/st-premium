    <p>LON­DON • Sonny Bill Wil­liams’ US$10 mil­lion (S$13.8 mil­lion) con­tract, said to be the rich­est in rugby his­tory, no longer has the same shine af­ter his club Toronto Wolfpack pulled out of the cur­rently sus­pended Su­per League sea­son on Mon­day, cit­ing the fi­nan­cial dev­as­ta­tion caused by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>When the former All Black signed the block­buster two-year deal in Novem­ber, Wolfpack owner David Ar­gyle had com­pared his sign­ing to a “LeBron James or David Beck­ham” join­ing the Cana­dian out­fit.</p>
    <p>But the pan­demic has put paid to those am­bi­tions. Rugby league’s first transat­lantic team played only six games in what was their maiden Su­per League sea­son be­fore the 12-team com­pe­ti­tion was put on ice in March.</p>
    <p>While the league will be restart­ing on Aug 2, the Wolfpack will not be par­tic­i­pat­ing due to “over­whelm­ing chal­lenges”.</p>
    <p>Toronto chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Bob Hunter told the Syd­ney Morn­ing Her­ald yes­ter­day that the team re­main hope­ful of re­turn­ing next year, but a 45 per cent pay cut had been en­acted.</p>
    <p>Wil­liams, along with the side’s other over­seas play­ers, has been granted per­mis­sion by Toronto to pur­sue a con­tract else­where following their Su­per League with­drawal.</p>
    <p>“I know Sonny is healthy and in good shape and he’ll have a lot of ap­peal,’’ Hunter said. “Sonny is ac­tu­ally plan­ning to take some time and rest in Europe, pos­si­bly Spain, be­fore head­ing back (home).</p>
    <p>“We’re book­ing the flights now for all those guys and their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>“We’ve told all the play­ers to­day, ‘Guys, if you can get on to an­other club, then go for it’. It won’t af­fect their pay with us be­cause it’s al­ready been re­duced to 55 per cent.</p>
    <p>But we’re en­cour­ag­ing them to do that.”</p>
    <p>Var­i­ous Na­tional Rugby League (NRL) clubs, in­clud­ing the New Zealand War­riors, have al­ready ap­proached the two-time Rugby World Cup win­ner.</p>
    <p>Said Cameron Ge­orge, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Auck­land-based club and the only NRL team out­side of Aus­tralia: “We’re in a po­si­tion where we’re go­ing to re­quire play­ers and if Sonny Bill Wil­liams be­comes avail­able, we’re go­ing to look at how it could hap­pen.</p>
    <p>“We’ll reach out for sure to try and un­der­stand the sit­u­a­tion, we’re al­ready look­ing for loan play­ers so imag­ine if it came off?</p>
    <p>“The stars would have to be aligned, and I don’t know if and when Sonny could even get to Aus­tralia. But we’d be mad not to ask the ques­tion.”</p>
