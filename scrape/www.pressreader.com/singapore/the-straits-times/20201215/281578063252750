    <p>More trav­ellers will be al­lowed to en­ter or tran­sit through Singapore as part of ef­forts to re­con­nect to the world and pre­serve the Re­pub­lic’s sta­tus as an air hub.</p>
    <p>But the re­open­ing of bor­ders will be done in a con­trolled man­ner so as not to over­whelm Singapore’s healthcare sys­tem and con­tact trac­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said yesterday.</p>
    <p>“With en­hanced test­ing and trac­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties, we will be able to pi­lot more sur­gi­cal ways to man­age the risks for trav­ellers,” he added.</p>
    <p>“For lo­gis­tics, we will main­tain our air, land and sea links with the world to per­form our role as a crit­i­cal sup­ply chain node for global lo­gis­tics to flow through.”</p>
    <p>Mr Chan noted how Singapore has not im­posed ex­port re­stric­tions which would have ben­e­fited it­self but af­fected the global sup­ply chain amid the rag­ing pan­demic.</p>
    <p>This has shown the world that the Re­pub­lic will hon­our its word even in a cri­sis, and that it will do its best to keep the global sup­ply chain mov­ing, he added.</p>
    <p>This re­build­ing of Singapore’s air hub is one of the four key strate­gies the Gov­ern­ment is adopt­ing as it seeks to tackle the eco­nomic chal­lenges brought about by Covid-19, said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing dur­ing a vir­tual press con­fer­ence by the Covid-19 multi-min­istry task force on Singapore’s plans as it moves into the third phase of eased cir­cuit breaker mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said the re­cov­ery next year is ex­pected to be grad­ual and un­even be­cause of re­cur­rent waves of in­fec­tions in other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>This is com­pounded by un­cer­tain­ties about the pace of vaccine pro­duc­tion, dis­tri­bu­tion and im­ple­men­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan also said the Gov­ern­ment ex­pects many sec­tors of Singapore’s econ­omy to be per­ma­nently changed.</p>
    <p>“We should pivot to seize new op­por­tu­ni­ties and over­come the cur­rent chal­lenges, start­ing now.”</p>
    <p>The sec­ond way in which the Gov­ern­ment will look to achieve this, apart from re­open­ing Singapore’s skies, is to re­sume eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity safely and pro­gres­sively, said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>“For those that have not been able to re­sume op­er­a­tions, we will con­tinue to work closely with them to pi­lot com­mer­cially vi­able and new ways to do so,” he said.</p>
    <p>The third way in which the Re­pub­lic will seek to help its econ­omy re­cover from the pan­demic is to adopt a “clear, con­sis­tent, co­her­ent and fa­cil­i­ta­tive pos­ture to at­tract high-value, long-term in­vest­ments” to the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter said that this ap­proach has helped to at­tract in­vest­ment from com­pa­nies such as Hyundai even dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He added: “Our plans in­clude seiz­ing the op­por­tu­ni­ties across di­verse group sec­tors such as ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing, fi­nan­cial ser­vices, in­fo­comms and me­dia, agri-tech and oth­ers.”</p>
    <p>More de­tails will be an­nounced in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>Fourth, Singapore will con­tinue to di­ver­sify its prod­uct and food sup­ply chains, as well as mar­kets, to make it­self more re­silient to dis­rup­tions, said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>This will be done by re­view­ing lo­cal food pro­duc­tion ca­pa­bil­i­ties and ex­pand­ing Singapore’s net­work of free trade agree­ment ar­eas, among other things.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said: “In con­clu­sion, we must never get com­pla­cent and let our guard down.</p>
    <p>“Oth­er­wise, com­pla­cency will deal us a fate no dif­fer­ent from coun­tries which have suf­fered from re­cur­ring waves of in­fec­tions that have fur­ther dis­rupted their eco­nomic re­cov­ery.”</p>
