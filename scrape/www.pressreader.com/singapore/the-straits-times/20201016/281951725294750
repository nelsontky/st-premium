    <p>Some 108,000 civil ser­vants will wel­come be­ing able to surf the In­ter­net on their work com­put­ers – after four years of us­ing a sep­a­rate de­vice to plug in to the Web.</p>
    <p>The priv­i­lege has not been ex­tended to ev­ery­body. A small group of 18,000 pub­lic ser­vants han­dling clas­si­fied in­for­ma­tion will still not be able to surf on their work com­put­ers. This points to a much larger is­sue at play: users’ naivety. More on that, later.</p>
    <p>For most, how­ever, the con­ve­nience has been made pos­si­ble by the roll-out of new re­mote brows­ing tech­nolo­gies – col­lec­tively known as Se­cure In­ter­net Surf­ing (SIS) – to con­tain mal­ware in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>These can make the lives of civil ser­vants sim­pler, while en­sur­ing that threats are kept at bay.</p>
    <p>The model is a huge de­par­ture from In­ter­net Surf­ing Sep­a­ra­tion (ISS), a blan­ket mea­sure in­tro­duced fully across the en­tire pub­lic ser­vice in 2017 to pro­tect work ma­chines from the dan­gers of the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>Un­der ISS, pub­lic ser­vants were re­port­edly car­ry­ing two lap­tops or a sep­a­rate tablet, or shar­ing ded­i­cated In­ter­net work­sta­tions.</p>
    <p>Work­flow was cum­ber­some and hardly be­fit­ting of a Smart Nation.</p>
    <p>Imag­ine hav­ing to man­u­ally type out Web links con­tained in work e-mails onto sep­a­rate In­ter­net de­vices to check out web­sites.</p>
    <p>The new SIS, which will ben­e­fit the ma­jor­ity of pub­lic ser­vants, may have taken four years to de­velop, but it is still a bold move as cy­ber threats con­tinue to loom.</p>
    <p>In the lat­est re­port from the</p>
    <p>Cy­ber Se­cu­rity Agency of Sin­ga­pore (CSA), about 530 unique “com­mand-and-con­trol” servers were de­tected in Sin­ga­pore last year, com­pared with 300 in 2018.</p>
    <p>Cy­ber crim­i­nals run these servers to con­trol in­fected sys­tems and steal sen­si­tive data. Close to 370 mal­ware vari­ants were de­tected in Sin­ga­pore last year.</p>
    <p>Mal­ware can in­fect com­put­ers when users surf on hacked web­sites, click on game demon­stra­tions or down­load in­fected mul­ti­me­dia files.</p>
    <p>SIS, which will kick in next month, will sani­tise these ac­tiv­i­ties and pre­vent work ma­chines from be­ing in­fected.</p>
    <p>And users need not lug a sep­a­rate de­vice or use com­mu­nal com­put­ers any­more.</p>
    <p>The four-year wait for this model was nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>The Smart Nation and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment Group said yes­ter­day that back then, there were no “suit­able ma­ture” so­lu­tions or prod­ucts to en­able pub­lic ser­vants to ac­cess the In­ter­net se­curely.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try sources say that the costs of such so­lu­tions have also come down.</p>
    <p>A set-up sim­i­lar to SIS would have cost much more two years ago, as there was no op­tion then to store users’ In­ter­net ac­cess and ac­tiv­ity logs – for dig­i­tal foren­sics in the event of a cy­ber at­tack – in the cloud. This would have meant ad­di­tional in­vest­ments in ded­i­cated broad­band con­nec­tiv­ity and hard­ware to man­age and store the log files.</p>
    <p>It is in­ter­est­ing to note, how­ever, that SIS does not plug in­for­ma­tion leaks aris­ing from cu­ri­ous users click­ing on ma­li­cious e-mail at­tach­ments and open­ing up their ma­chines to mal­ware in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>This brings us back to any sys­tem’s great­est weak­ness – the naive user.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment may have other safe­guards to fil­ter out ma­li­cious at­tach­ments, but some may still slip past the fil­ters. After all, tech­nol­ogy is not fool­proof.</p>
    <p>This is per­haps why pub­lic ser­vants han­dling clas­si­fied in­for­ma­tion will not be given ac­cess to the Web on their work ma­chines.</p>
    <p>The un­sus­pect­ing user is the most vul­ner­a­ble, and is said to be the weak­est link in a se­cure chain.</p>
    <p>Users’ naivety is also why phish­ing re­mains the most ef­fec­tive hack­ing tool to this day.</p>
    <p>Phish­ing is a mech­a­nism where hack­ers pre­tend to be some­one fa­mil­iar or rep­utable and fool un­sus­pect­ing vic­tims into re­veal­ing sen­si­tive in­for­ma­tion such as pass­words to get a foot in the door of cor­po­rate net­works.</p>
    <p>Take SingHealth’s mas­sive data leak, dis­cov­ered in 2018, in­volv­ing the per­sonal data of 1.5 mil­lion pa­tients – in­clud­ing the dis­pensed med­i­ca­tion records of Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong. It started when a user at a SingHealth hospi­tal fell prey to a state-spon­sored phish­ing at­tack.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing Sin­ga­pore’s worst data leak, work­ers in all pub­lic health­care in­sti­tu­tions were barred from surf­ing the Web on their com­put­ers. These in­sti­tu­tions could be the next to im­ple­ment a sim­i­lar re­mote brows­ing so­lu­tion to en­able se­cure In­ter­net surf­ing.</p>
    <p>The threat of cy­ber at­tacks shows no signs of go­ing away.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to CSA, there were 47,500 cases of phish­ing in Sin­ga­pore last year, a three­fold in­crease from 2018.</p>
    <p>While hav­ing nor­mal­ity re­turn to the daily work­flow in the pub­lic sec­tor is a good thing, let­ting one’s guard down is still not an op­tion.</p>
