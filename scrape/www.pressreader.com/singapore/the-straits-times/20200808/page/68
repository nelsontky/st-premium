Listen carefully – someone is trying to set you straight. It may be some misinforma­tion you picked up or you could be on a difficult course. Cancer (June 21 - July 22)
Your fast thinking gets you out of trouble more than once. Try to avoid trouble altogether if you can, as that way is much safer. Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)
Your mental energy is strong and bold and you absorb informatio­n with ease. You may find the things you learn make your path clearer. Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)
You may be inspired, so get busy and make sure you have something to work on. If not, seek out new options or consult with wise friends. C: Children; CA: Current Affairs;

You are focused on relationsh­ips at the expense of your own issues. Pay people the attention they deserve so you get what you need in return. (Oct 23 - Nov 21)
Tackle every task methodical­ly or you may miss key details. Your energy is fine for small stuff, but the big picture may be harder.

Your family is pulling you away from something you love, so you have to make a choice. Once you are past this, your life will improve. Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)
Your big ideas are exciting and people are gathering to hear them. Make your voice heard and explain everything carefully. Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)
Things are working out well for you, thanks to your new absorption in an idea, a cause or even a new person. Whatever it is, follow it up.
