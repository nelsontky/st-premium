    <p>LON­DON • Mr Do­minic Cum­mings, Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s most pow­er­ful ad­viser, will step down by year end, re­duc­ing the sway of Brexit hard­lin­ers as Mr John­son tries to re­cast his premier­ship af­ter a se­ries of fail­ures in tack­ling the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son is grap­pling with a bat­tle be­tween fac­tions over the fu­ture course of the gov­ern­ment just as he strug­gles to con­tain the Covid-19 out­break, es­tab­lish a rap­port with United States Pres­i­den­t­elect Joe Bi­den and mas­ter the del­i­cate diplo­macy of a last-minute Brexit trade agree­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Cum­mings, who mas­ter­minded the 2016 Brexit ref­er­en­dum vote and Mr John­son’s land­slide election win last year, told the BBC that he wanted to be largely re­dun­dant by the end of this year, once Bri­tain has left in­for­mal mem­ber­ship of the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics said that while the up­heaval in Down­ing Street was un­wel­come at a time of na­tional cri­sis, the an­nounce­ment marked the end of Mr Cum­mings’ pol­icy clout.</p>
    <p>“I think that Dom now, so far as West­min­ster is con­cerned, is a busted flush,” said one Con­ser­va­tive law­maker who spoke on con­di­tion of anonymity.</p>
    <p>The exit of Mr John­son’s pre­sid­ing right-hand man marks one of the most sig­nif­i­cant changes to the Prime Min­is­ter’s in­ner cir­cle to date: Mr Cum­mings was cast by some as Mr John­son’s “brain” – a fig­ure who wielded piv­otal in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>A com­mit­ted Brex­i­teer, Mr Cum­mings was seen by Euro­pean diplo­mats as a hard­line in­flu­ence on Mr John­son over Brexit and the pro­po­nent of Mad­man The­ory – a ref­er­ence to for­mer US pres­i­dent Richard Nixon’s at­tempt to con­tain the Soviet Union dur­ing the Cold War by con­vinc­ing Moscow that he was ir­ra­tional.</p>
    <p>Mr Cum­mings, 48, ed­u­cated at Ox­ford and mar­ried to the daugh­ter of a baronet, scorned the Bri­tish po­lit­i­cal es­tab­lish­ment and hurled barbs at re­porters and Cabi­net min­is­ters alike.</p>
    <p>He was cast in the Spit­ting Im­age satir­i­cal pup­pet show as an alien who re­peat­edly threat­ened Mr John­son with res­ig­na­tion – and some­times asked to eat his child. In the show, Mr John­son al­ways told Mr Cum­mings he could not eat his child.</p>
    <p>An uniden­ti­fied source told the BBC that Mr Cum­mings “jumped be­cause oth­er­wise he would be pushed soon”.</p>
    <p>With Mr John­son pon­der­ing de­ci­sions on fu­ture re­la­tions with the EU and the Covid-stricken econ­omy that could make or break Bri­tish pros­per­ity for a gen­er­a­tion, the 56-year-old premier ap­peared trapped be­tween ri­val fac­tions within his in­ner cir­cle in a drama akin to the court in­trigues of a Tu­dor monarch.</p>
    <p>The bat­tle spilled into the open with the res­ig­na­tion of his di­rec­tor of com­mu­ni­ca­tions, Mr Lee Cain, a close Cum­mings ally who had been tipped as a new chief of staff.</p>
    <p>The West­min­ster po­lit­i­cal bub­ble was awash with spec­u­la­tion that Mr John­son’s fiancee Car­rie Sy­monds aligned with Mr John­son’s new West Wing-style press sec­re­tary Al­le­gra Strat­ton to oust Mr Cain – to the dis­plea­sure of Mr Cum­mings, who then threat­ened to re­sign.</p>
    <p>But Mr Cum­mings told the BBC that “ru­mours of me threat­en­ing to re­sign are in­vented, ru­mours of me ask­ing oth­ers to re­sign are in­vented”.</p>
    <p>His dis­re­gard for ac­cepted norms is well known. He had said he had done noth­ing wrong by driv­ing over 400km from Lon­don to ob­tain child­care at a time when Bri­tons were in lock­down and or­dered to stay at home to mit­i­gate the spread of Covid-19.</p>
