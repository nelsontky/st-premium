    <p>With a name like Swift, one can ex­pect reg­u­lar up­grades to make the car go faster. But not this time.</p>
    <p>Suzuki has given its pop­u­lar hatch­back a mid-life facelift which en­hances its re­fine­ment, ef­fi­ciency and safety. But it does noth­ing for its per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>The ex­te­rior makeover is mi­nor. The car gets a new grille de­sign that adds 5mm to its 3,840mm length, which means it largely re­tains its com­pact di­men­sions.</p>
    <p>Un­der the bon­net, the Swift gets a new en­gine – its one-litre tur­bocharged three-cylin­der has made way for a 1.2-litre nat­u­rallyaspi­rated four-cylin­der.</p>
    <p>The new en­gine is mated to a “mild hy­brid” sys­tem that re­cov­ers en­ergy lost in brak­ing and de­cel­er­a­tion, and stores it in a 12-volt lithium ion bat­tery. This en­ergy pow­ers on-board equip­ment and pro­vides a mild shove on ac­cel­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The six-speed au­to­box has also been re­placed by a con­tin­u­ously vari­able trans­mis­sion (CVT).</p>
    <p>The new pow­er­train low­ers fuel con­sump­tion from 5.7 to 4.13 litres/100km.</p>
    <p>But the Swift pays a price in terms of per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>En­gine out­put has dropped from 109bhp to 80bhp, with torque go­ing from 160Nm to 107Nm. As a re­sult, its cen­tury sprint now takes 12.2 sec­onds, from 10 sec­onds pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>In the cock­pit, a new 7-inch touch­screen in­fo­tain­ment unit, com­pat­i­ble with An­droid Auto and Ap­ple Carplay, takes the place of an old non-touch­screen unit.</p>
    <p>The car now gets adap­tive cruise con­trol and ma­jor safety up­grades: tyre de­fla­tion warn­ing, lane-de­par­ture warn­ing, a “weav­ing alert” and pre-emp­tive brak­ing if the car de­tects po­ten­tial col­li­sion.</p>
    <p>Many of these fea­tures are un­com­mon in cars in the $80,000 to $90,000 price bracket.</p>
    <p>The Swift has long been favoured by en­thu­si­as­tic driv­ers for its kart­like han­dling. It re­tains its han­dling chops and is still fun to toss around bendy roads. But stomp­ing on the throt­tle does not fire up the en­gine with the same ur­gency as its pre­de­ces­sor.</p>
    <p>Thanks to seven pre­set ra­tios of the CVT, you can still have some mea­sure of driv­ing in­volve­ment.</p>
    <p>On the first day of the test drive, I sorely missed the car’s pre­de­ces­sor, which I have owned for the past two years. I warmed up to the test ride only the next day.</p>
    <p>The re­freshed Swift is a more pol­ished and grown-up evo­lu­tion of its friskier pre­de­ces­sor, pre­fer­ring to move at a less hur­ried pace. It even made my wife doze off in the pas­sen­ger’s seat – some­thing that never hap­pened in the older Swift.</p>
    <p>The fuel con­sump­tion is as­tound­ingly low. Over a three-day, 230km drive, I con­sis­tently achieved less than 5 litres/100km with­out try­ing hard, hit­ting as low as 4.3 litres/100km on some oc­ca­sions, which is close to the of­fi­cial 4.13 litres/100km.</p>
    <p>This new char­ac­ter of the Swift is likely to lose it some fans, in­clud­ing cur­rent own­ers who bought it be­cause it is a pocket-friendly rocket.</p>
    <p>But its new­found re­fine­ment, improved fuel econ­omy and bet­ter equip­ment should also win over new ones.</p>
