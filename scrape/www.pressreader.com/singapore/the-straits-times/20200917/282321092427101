    <p>ROME No­vak Djokovic turned the page on his con­tentious US Open exit and be­gan his clay-court sea­son with a con­vinc­ing 6-3, 6-2 vic­tory over wild card Salvatore Caruso in the sec­ond round of the Ital­ian Open yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The world No. 1 was dis­qual­i­fied in New York after ac­ci­den­tally hit­ting a line judge with a ball dur­ing his fourth round match against Pablo Car­reno Busta.</p>
    <p>Djokovic’s frus­tra­tion boiled over after drop­ping his serve against the Spa­niard in the open­ing set at Flush­ing Mead­ows, but 10 days on in Rome, he did not face a sin­gle break point in an im­pe­ri­ous dis­play against the un­seeded Caruso.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously I had an early exit (at the US Open) so had more time to pre­pare,” the Ser­bian said court­side. “I did prac­tice for a week now and tried to play some sets com­ing into this ATP 1000 match.</p>
    <p>“Caruso is a clay court spe­cial­ist and it was a great chal­lenge to­day.”</p>
    <p>On ar­rival in Rome, an apolo­getic Djokovic vowed to be “the best ver­sion” of him­self on and off the court, and he kept his emo­tions in check against lo­cal hope Caruso.</p>
    <p>Four-time Rome cham­pion Djokovic, who re­ceived an open­ing-round bye, broke Caruso’s serve in the eighth game before serv­ing out the open­ing set.</p>
    <p>Caruso, who bat­tled past Amer­i­can Ten­nys Sand­gren in the open­ing round for his first ATP Mas­ters 1000 match win, dropped his serve in a see-saw third game of the sec­ond set which lasted nearly 12 min­utes.</p>
    <p>With mo­men­tum firmly on his side, top seed Djokovic broke his op­po­nent for a third time in the match before cel­e­brat­ing by blow­ing kisses into the empty stands at the Foro Ital­ico.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing recorded 51 vic­to­ries in 60 matches, Djokovic is the sec­ond most suc­cess­ful player in the tour­na­ment’s his­tory – just be­hind nine-time cham­pion Rafael Nadal.</p>
    <p>Djokovic has won 27 of his 28 matches this year and will re­sume his hunt for an 18th Grand Slam ti­tle at the French Open, which be­gins on Sept 27.</p>
    <p>“My best results have come on hard court but I en­joy com­pet­ing on clay,” said the 33-year-old, who will face ei­ther fel­low Ser­bian Filip Kra­ji­novic or Italy’s Marco Cecchi­nato for a place in the last-16.</p>
    <p>“It’s a de­mand­ing sur­face where you have to be pa­tient and con­struct your points.”</p>
