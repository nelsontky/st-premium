    <p>You do not have to be a biker to en­joy Han­dle­bar in Gill­man Bar­racks.</p>
    <p>Sur­rounded by lush green­ery, the biker’s bar feels like a get­away from city life. On sunny week­day af­ter­noons, you can hear chirp­ing in­sects in the out­door din­ing area.</p>
    <p>You can see why bik­ers like chill­ing out here, as they can park their rides right in front of the bar.</p>
    <p>Han­dle­bar first opened at 1 Lock Road in 1999, then moved to Sem­bawang. It moved back to Gill­man Bar­racks in 2015.</p>
    <p>Han­dle­bar’s owner, Ms Jan Pek, 51, says its decor is heav­ily in­flu­enced and in­spired by her hus­band’s love for bikes and mu­sic.</p>
    <p>Ms Pek, whose red Du­cati is on dis­play on the porch, says the bar was con­ceived as a place for bik­ers to hang out and to get non-bik­ers in­ter­ested in rid­ing. It has a seat­ing ca­pac­ity of 250, but now seats 50 peo­ple in­doors and 100 out­doors due to safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Used mo­tor­bike and bi­cy­cle parts have been turned into fur­ni­ture and dec­o­ra­tive ob­jects in the bar.</p>
    <p>Ms Pek, for in­stance, turned two cus­tom-made hel­mets into lamp shades. Bar stools and seats are made from Vespa parts and bi­cy­cle wheel rims.</p>
    <p>Han­dle­bar also has a mo­saic gas­fired pizza oven cus­tom-made in Italy. For fuss-free grub, try the Blos­som Onion ($14++) and Smoked Pork With Jalapeno Home­Made Pizza ($14++).</p>
    <p>For a full-throt­tle drink, go for the Mo­torised Mar­garita ($55++, serves four), made us­ing a petrol-fu­elled mo­torised blender which is brought to your ta­ble. The blend­ing is done at top speed right be­fore your eyes – per­fect for an In­sta­gram story.</p>
