    <p>BER­LIN Chelsea striker Timo Werner scored twice on his re­turn to Leipzig on Satur­day, as Ger­many went top of their Na­tions League A Group 4 after a con­vinc­ing 3-1 win over Ukraine.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing moved to the Pre­mier League side in sum­mer after four years with RB Leipzig, Werner played a star­ring role be­hind closed doors at the Red Bull Arena.</p>
    <p>“I had four good years here and it was fun to come back here and win,” he told lo­cal broad­caster ZDF.</p>
    <p>De­spite miss­ing the sus­pended Toni Kroos and Joshua Kim­mich, whose knee in­jury will keep him out un­til next year, the hosts were still too strong for the vis­i­tors even though Werner ad­mit­ted that the ab­sen­tees “made it hard to find our rhythm”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he be­lieves Ger­many will hit their peak when they start their Euro 2020 cam­paign against world cham­pi­ons France in Mu­nich in June.</p>
    <p>“We have enough time to im­prove be­fore the Eu­ros,” Werner added.</p>
    <p>The win leaves Ger­many un­de­feated in their last 12 games and top of their Na­tions League group on nine points, one ahead of sec­ond-placed Spain, with the sides due to meet in Sevilla to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>“We had plenty of tempo in the first-half, con­trolled the game after the break, even if we gave away too much pos­ses­sion at times,” said coach Joachim Low.</p>
    <p>“All in all, we have to be happy with the win.</p>
    <p>“We wanted also to warm up as a team (ahead of the Eu­ros) and we did that to a cer­tain ex­tent.”</p>
    <p>The game was con­firmed only hours be­fore kick-off, as five mem­bers of the Ukraine team were quar­an­tined after test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19 last Friday.</p>
    <p>But the Ukraini­ans took an early lead when Ro­man Yarem­chuk caught Die Mannschaft’s de­fence nap­ping, spoil­ing cap­tain Manuel Neuer’s hope of a clean sheet on his 95th ap­pear­ance to equal Sepp Maier’s record for the most num­ber of caps as Ger­many goal­keeper.</p>
    <p>Low’s side roared back with three unan­swered goals by Leroy Sane and Werner, who scored ei­ther side of half-time, to seal the win.</p>
