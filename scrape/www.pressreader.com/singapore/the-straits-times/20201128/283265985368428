    <p>Two decades ago, the South Korean com­pany com­mis­sioned Amer­i­can elec­tric ve­hi­cle spe­cial­ist Enova Sys­tems to de­velop var­i­ous sys­tems for fu­ture mod­els... While</p>
    <p>Enova was Amer­i­can, its chair­man and chief deal maker An­thony Rawl­in­son was a Bri­ton who lived in Sin­ga­pore from 1982 to 2016.</p>
    <p>Hyundai Mo­tor’s move to set up an elec­tric car plant in Sin­ga­pore may have been writ­ten in the stars.</p>
    <p>Two decades ago, the South Korean com­pany com­mis­sioned Amer­i­can elec­tric ve­hi­cle (EV) spe­cial­ist Enova Sys­tems to de­velop var­i­ous sys­tems for fu­ture mod­els, in­clud­ing hybrid, elec­tric and fuel-cell sys­tems.</p>
    <p>That early col­lab­o­ra­tion has con­trib­uted to Hyundai be­ing at the fore­front of elec­tri­fi­ca­tion to­day and hav­ing a suite of hybrid, elec­tric and fuel cell cars that you can buy.</p>
    <p>While Enova was Amer­i­can, its chair­man and chief deal maker An­thony Rawl­in­son was a Bri­ton who lived in Sin­ga­pore from 1982 to 2016.</p>
    <p>He was an EV ad­vo­cate ahead of his time. When I first met him in 2000 (years be­fore Tesla was founded), the fund man­ager by day was al­ready con­vinced that EVs were the way for­ward.</p>
    <p>Which was why he helped re­struc­ture Enova (pre­vi­ously known as US Elec­tricar) in the 1990s, sought new in­vestors and bro­kered deals such as the one with Hyundai.</p>
    <p>At the time, Enova was the only com­pany which sup­plied com­plete EV sys­tems, which it mar­keted un­der the Pan­ther brand name. Be­sides cars, Enova elec­tric sys­tems can be found in mass rapid tran­sit and mono­rail ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>“We had the best team, but we were too early,” Mr Rawl­in­son, 65, tells The Straits Times over the tele­phone from London.</p>
    <p>Be­ing early, how­ever, has paid hand­some div­i­dends for Hyundai Mo­tor. It is the first among main­stream au­tomak­ers to have petrol-elec­tric hybrid, bat­tery-pow­ered and hy­dro­gen fuel-cells mod­els in its pro­duc­tion line-up.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, it an­nounced that it would be rolling out at least three new elec­tric mod­els over the next four years bear­ing the Ioniq name­plate. One of these mod­els will be made in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>It is serendip­i­tous that out of the scores of pos­si­ble lo­ca­tions, the Korean au­to­mo­tive gi­ant has picked Sin­ga­pore as the site for its first smart elec­tric car plant.</p>
    <p>The fact that Sin­ga­pore does not even have a full-fledged au­to­mo­tive in­dus­try – a sec­tor it ex­ited four decades ago – makes Hyundai’s de­ci­sion, an­nounced last month, all the more sur­pris­ing.</p>
    <p>In fact, it is the first time the com­pany will be build­ing a car plant in a coun­try which does not have ve­hi­cle manufactur­ing.</p>
    <p>While that may be the case, Sin­ga­pore does have many com­pa­nies which are sup­pli­ers to au­tomak­ers, in­clud­ing Tier 1 play­ers such as Ap­tiv, ZF, Con­ti­nen­tal and Del­phi Tech. Tier 1 firms sup­ply di­rectly to and work closely with car­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is also known for its su­perb in­fra­struc­ture, rule of law and in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy and lo­gis­tics sup­port, mak­ing it a business-friendly en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>But that col­lab­o­ra­tion with Enova 20 years ago may well have been the but­ter­fly ef­fect that nudged Hyundai to­wards Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>As for Enova, slug­gish de­mand led to losses and debts. The com­pany be­came de­funct in 2012. Mr Rawl­in­son stepped down as chair­man in 2008.</p>
    <p>He has since re­turned to</p>
    <p>London. To­day, he is, among other things, ad­viser to Power Roll, which makes flex­i­ble so­lar film that is said to be cheaper and as ef­fi­cient as tra­di­tional pho­to­voltaic pan­els. Be­ing a film, it can also be read­ily ap­plied to more sur­faces.</p>
    <p>The avail­abil­ity of cheaper so­lar en­ergy has an­other spin-off: cheap hy­dro­gen.</p>
    <p>Hy­dro­gen is now increasing­ly seen as the next big thing. Hy­dro­gen fuel cells, for in­stance, make elec­tric­ity via a chem­i­cal process us­ing stored hy­dro­gen and oxy­gen in the air.</p>
    <p>Un­like bat­tery-pow­ered EVs which re­quire hours to recharge, fuel cell cars can be re­fu­elled (with com­pressed hy­dro­gen) as quickly as con­ven­tional com­bus­tion-en­gined ve­hi­cles to­day.</p>
    <p>One stum­bling block is the high cost of hy­dro­gen, which cur­rently re­tails at about twice the price of petrol.</p>
    <p>But Mr Rawl­in­son is con­vinced the cost of hy­dro­gen can be re­duced by 90 per cent when its cost of pro­duc­tion plunges. This will make the fuel cheaper than petrol, diesel and even elec­tric­ity from the grid.</p>
    <p>But the as­tute in­vestor says there will still be a place for bat­ter­ies.</p>
    <p>Fuel cell cars will have lithium-ion bat­ter­ies to store re­cu­per­ated en­ergy from ve­hi­cle brak­ing and coast­ing, mak­ing them more ef­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>And for cer­tain ap­pli­ca­tions such as works ve­hi­cles de­ployed un­der­ground, bat­ter­ies are pos­si­bly safer than hy­dro­gen.</p>
    <p>When will hy­dro­gen take off? Watch this space.</p>
