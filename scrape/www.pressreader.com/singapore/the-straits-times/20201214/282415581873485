    <p>Scriptwrit­ers take many lib­er­ties with sci­en­tific ac­cu­racy in space movies, but for­mer Na­tional Aero­nau­tics and Space Ad­min­is­tra­tion (Nasa) as­tro­naut Daniel Tani thinks there is one thing that the movie The Mar­tian got right.</p>
    <p>And that is the grit of the movie’s pro­tag­o­nist – an as­tro­naut left be­hind on Mars af­ter his crew mates thought him dead.</p>
    <p>He tries to use sci­ence to deal with the chal­lenges pre­sented by life on an in­hos­pitable planet, and suc­ceeds.</p>
    <p>“What I re­ally en­joyed about that movie was the way he sur­vived,” Mr Tani told The Straits Times from Fair­fax, Vir­ginia, in a video in­ter­view last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“He found him­self in a re­ally dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tion, had to think his way out of it, and he had to make re­ally strate­gic de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>“And that re­ally re­sounded with me... That’s the way an as­tro­naut would be­have, not freak out,” the 59-year-old said.</p>
    <p>An in­quis­i­tive mind, self-re­liance and a sense of ad­ven­ture are im­por­tant for as­pir­ing as­tro­nauts, he said.</p>
    <p>“For young chil­dren, I don’t want to say ‘here’s what you have to do to be­come an as­tro­naut’, be­cause it cer­tainly might change in the next 20 years,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But the things that prob­a­bly won’t change is hav­ing a sense of ad­ven­ture and ex­plo­ration, hav­ing an in­quis­i­tive mind, and be­ing able to take care of them­selves,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Tani, who spoke about his jour­ney to space at the Sin­ga­pore Fin­Tech Fes­ti­val last Mon­day, spent more than 131 days in space dur­ing his time with Nasa.</p>
    <p>He left the United States space agency in 2012, and is now di­rec­tor of foun­da­tion grants for the United States-Ja­pan Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>One ma­jor take­away from his time in space was the abil­ity to step back and see the big­ger pic­ture, he said.</p>
    <p>He found a sym­bolic el­e­ment to it.</p>
    <p>“It con­nected me with my home planet in a way that I never did be­fore,” he said, re­call­ing the view of Earth’s cur­va­ture from his time on board the In­ter­na­tional Space Sta­tion.</p>
    <p>But be­yond that was also the un­der­stand­ing of how space sci­ence could im­pact life on Earth.</p>
    <p>Satel­lite al­time­try, for in­stance, is a tech­nique that sci­en­tists are now us­ing to study how sea lev­els are ris­ing with global warm­ing.</p>
    <p>Satel­lite radar al­time­ters mea­sure sea lev­els by mea­sur­ing the time it takes a radar pulse to make a round trip from the satel­lite to the sea sur­face and back.</p>
    <p>And as sen­sor tech­nol­ogy im­proves, so, too, can hu­man un­der­stand­ing of the planet.</p>
    <p>“We’ve ac­cu­mu­lated a huge amount of data that will help us in sci­en­tific en­deav­ours like fig­ur­ing out what’s hap­pen­ing with our cli­mate,” Mr Tani said.</p>
    <p>He noted that some peo­ple have ques­tioned the need to fund space sci­ence when there are so many press­ing chal­lenges on Earth.</p>
    <p>But ba­sic sci­ence is cru­cial in</p>
    <p>BEN­E­FITS OF SPACE PRO­GRAMME</p>
    <p>We used to say that be­cause of Apollo, be­cause we went to the Moon, we have smaller com­put­ers... The space pro­gramme used to be the cre­ator of all this in­ter­est­ing tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>MR DANIEL TANI, who noted that some peo­ple have ques­tioned the need to fund space sci­ence when there are so many press­ing chal­lenges on Earth.</p>
    <p>mankind’s con­tin­ued un­der­stand­ing of ev­ery­thing, he said.</p>
    <p>“We used to say that be­cause of Apollo, be­cause we went to the Moon, we have smaller com­put­ers... The space pro­gramme used to be the cre­ator of all this in­ter­est­ing tech­nol­ogy,” he said.</p>
    <p>But the cost of satel­lite tech­nol­ogy has come down in re­cent years, cre­at­ing new jobs in new mar­kets around the world, in­clud­ing in Asia, Mr Tani said.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tific break­throughs around the world, whether in space sci</p>
    <p>ence or en­gi­neer­ing or hu­man health, were the re­sult of one sci­en­tific group build­ing on the work of an­other.</p>
    <p>Mr Tani added: “It’s be­cause we’ve had all these sci­en­tists do­ing re­search projects or ex­per­i­ments that, on their own, may (to some peo­ple) seem silly or trite, (but) add that whole pack­age to­gether, and then you’re mak­ing some real dif­fer­ence in the world.”</p>
