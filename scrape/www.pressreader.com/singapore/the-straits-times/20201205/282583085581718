    <p>LON­DON • For the first time in 270 days, fans were back in­side a Pre­mier League ground as Arse­nal wel­comed 2,000 sup­port­ers into the Emi­rates for Thurs­day’s rou­tine 4-1 Europa League Group B win over Aus­tria’s Rapid Vi­enna.</p>
    <p>The hosts had al­ready qual­i­fied for the knock­out phase, but the sparse crowd in the 60,000-ca­pac­ity sta­dium were still in high spir­its as Alexan­dre La­cazette, Pablo Mari, Ed­die Nke­tiah and sub­sti­tute Emile Smith Rowe all net­ted to main­tain their 100 per cent record.</p>
    <p>“I’m de­lighted to have fans back, they make a huge dif­fer­ence,” said Arse­nal man­ager Mikel Arteta.</p>
    <p>“We had 2,000 but they were loud and they were sup­port­ive to the team so thanks to them for com­ing and mak­ing the ef­fort.”</p>
    <p>Out­side the ground, fans held up a ban­ner read­ing “Home at last, Thank you NHS” in trib­ute to those work­ing on the health­care front line bat­tling the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. Be­fore kick-off, a video was screened with a mes­sage from cap­tain Pierre-Em­er­ick Aubameyang that read: “Foot­ball is all about you, the fans – we have missed you and we are so happy to be wel­com­ing you back.”</p>
    <p>Club mas­cot Gun­ner­saurus also made a be­lated re­turn af­ter longserv­ing em­ployee Jerry Quy, who was ini­tially re­trenched, was re­in­stated af­ter mid­fielder Me­sut Ozil stepped in to cover his salary.</p>
    <p>The last game on English soil to have fans was back in March, so they were thrilled to once again go through the turn­stiles even though Thurs­day’s game had no sig­nif­i­cance other than to con­firm Arse­nal as group win­ners.</p>
    <p>The club’s web­site crashed due to the de­mand for tick­ets and sup­porter Dan An­der­son felt it was a small step to­wards nor­mal­ity.</p>
    <p>“It’s just get­ting back to nor­mal. You work hard all week and to have that re­ward to be able to go to a game at the week­end or at night is what you want,” he said.</p>
    <p>While the norm is a long road ahead – pubs around the Emi­rates re­main closed as Tier 2 re­stric­tions mean al­co­hol can­not be served without food – the play­ers made it clear they missed the sup­port.</p>
    <p>“It’s just great to have that sound back and have our 12th man back,” said Ains­ley Mait­land-Niles.</p>
    <p>In Group J, Tot­ten­ham warmed up for to­mor­row’s north Lon­don derby with Arse­nal by reach­ing the last 32 of the Europa League but their 3-3 draw at Aus­tria’s Lask left Jose Mour­inho un­happy at the lack of com­mit­ment.</p>
    <p>While Gareth Bale and Dele Alli con­verted penal­ties ei­ther side of Son He­ung-min’s strike, the Spurs boss felt it showed why his fringe play­ers re­main on the pe­riph­ery.</p>
    <p>“Noth­ing new re­ally,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The fact the Europa League group phase doesn’t mo­ti­vate some of the play­ers, I knew it.”</p>
    <p>Spurs must beat Bel­gium’s An­twerp next week to fin­ish as group win­ners.</p>
    <p>They make a huge dif­fer­ence. We had 2,000 but they were loud and they were sup­port­ive to the team so thanks to them for com­ing and mak­ing the ef­fort.</p>
