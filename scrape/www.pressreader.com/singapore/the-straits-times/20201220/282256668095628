    <p>Covid-19 has ac­cel­er­ated the ex­pan­sion of cloud or ghost kitchens in Sin­ga­pore, as peo­ple get used to or­der­ing food de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>There are now at least 10 such shared kitchen spa­ces here, op­er­ated by com­pa­nies in­clud­ing food de­liv­ery play­ers De­liv­eroo, food­panda and GrabFood.</p>
    <p>Food and bev­er­age busi­nesses have set up shop in th­ese kitchens to widen their de­liv­ery ra­dius and reach more cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Even big-name restau­rants have taken to cloud kitchens. Last month, dim sum es­tab­lish­ment Swee Choon an­nounced its first cloud kitchen space at Tampines Food Co, run by Smart City Kitchens.</p>
    <p>Some com­pa­nies also use cloud kitchens for re­search and de­vel­op­ment, while oth­ers use them to try out new de­liv­ery-only con­cepts – an­other grow­ing trend.</p>
    <p>Two-month-old cloud kitchen Is­land Kitchen Col­lec­tive, for ex­am­ple, is fo­cus­ing on its two vir­tual restau­rants: Wabi Sabi, which does Ja­panese food; and Mer­cato Gatto, which of­fers Mediter­ranean fare.</p>
    <p>The key cloud kitchen play­ers have ex­panded their spa­ces in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, Smart City Kitchens opened its lat­est fa­cil­ity at Cross Street Ex­change, adding to its three ex­ist­ing ones in Or­chard Road, Sem­bawang and Cle­menti. Each has about 20 to 30 kitchen spa­ces.</p>
    <p>Also in Oc­to­ber, Grab opened a new GrabKitche­n in Alju­nied, af­ter open­ing one in Hil­lview in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>The Hil­lview space is at full ca­pac­ity with more than 20 brands, while the Alju­nied site is al­most full with more than 15 brands, in­clud­ing Wolf Burg­ers and bub­ble tea brand Play­made.</p>
    <p>A Grab spokesman says: “GrabKitche­n Hil­lview’s aver­age num­ber of or­ders is grow­ing by around 20 per cent month on month. GrabKitche­n Alju­nied is also see­ing steady up­take in de­mand.”</p>
    <p>A key rea­son for the good de­mand is that cloud kitchens of­fer choice and va­ri­ety, adds the spokesman.</p>
    <p>“We have ob­served an in­crease in the pro­por­tion of mix-and-match or­ders through GrabKitche­n over the last few months. This means con­sumers are or­der­ing from two or more stores to form com­plete meals (food, dessert and drinks) with just one de­liv­ery fee.”</p>
    <p>Next year, food­panda Sin­ga­pore plans to open five more kitchens, in an­tic­i­pa­tion of the in­creased de­mand for de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>Its op­er­a­tions di­rec­tor Jorge Ru­bio, 36, also ex­pects more in­ter­na­tional brands to launch in Sin­ga­pore via vir­tual kitchen con­cepts to “suss out mar­ket ap­petite and po­ten­tial to scale the business”. He adds: “When it comes to vir­tual brands, the pos­si­bil­i­ties are end­less. Be­yond cooked food, restau­rants can also look at of­fer­ing var­i­ous types of op­tions, in­clud­ing ready-to-cook meal kits.”</p>
