    <p>With M1 launch­ing its 5G ser­vice last month, the three ma­jor tel­cos here have now rolled out their trial ser­vices to con­sumers.</p>
    <p>But be­cause these 5G net­works are built on top of ex­ist­ing 4G ones, they of­fer only par­tial ben­e­fits of 5G tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Users with a com­pat­i­ble 5Gen­abled de­vice will en­joy in­creased mo­bile speeds, al­low­ing uses such as cloud gam­ing and live vir­tu­al­re­al­ity events, tel­cos say.</p>
    <p>Trans­for­ma­tive ben­e­fits, such as the ul­tra-low la­tency es­sen­tial for uses such as self-driv­ing cars and re­mote surgery, will be avail­able only with the na­tion­wide 5G net­works, which are due to be fully pushed out in 2025.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, what can users ex­pect from the 5G trial ser­vices? The Straits Times puts the three telco’s 5G net­works to the test a week ago.</p>
    <p>As the com­pa­nies are in the midst of ex­pand­ing their 5G net­works, there are still sig­nif­i­cant gaps in cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>M1 and Sing­tel have fo­cused on the cen­tral and down­town ar­eas, while StarHub, which claims to have 70 per cent cov­er­age across Sin­ga­pore, has 5G up and run­ning in town cen­tres across the is­land.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of the spotty cov­er­age, find­ing a lo­ca­tion where all three tel­cos had 5G cov­er­age was dif­fi­cult. Thus, our tests were con­ducted at var­i­ous out­door sites rec­om­mended by the tel­cos.</p>
    <p>The Speedtest app by broad­band speed-test­ing ser­vice Ookla was used to mea­sure the down­load and up­load speeds of each net­work. For com­par­i­son, the telco’s 4G net­work was also tested at each lo­ca­tion (see ta­ble).</p>
    <p>Our tests found that the 5G net­works were con­sis­tently faster than the ex­ist­ing 4G ones in mo­bile down­load speeds at the same lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The 5G mo­bile down­load speeds were be­tween 20 per cent and 490 per cent faster than the 4G net­work’s. Speeds of more than 100Mbps were the norm, un­like with 4G net­works.</p>
    <p>Sing­tel achieved the high­est down­load speed of more than 500Mbps out­side VivoCity – one of sev­eral lo­ca­tions where it has de­ployed a 5G net­work that uses the faster 3.5GHz spec­trum.</p>
    <p>Most of Sing­tel’s 5G net­work, though, uses the slower 2.1GHz spec­trum, which is also used by M1 and StarHub. For 5G net­works on the 2.1GHz spec­trum, down­load speeds ap­pear to top at slightly more than 200Mbps in our tests.</p>
    <p>Up­load speeds, which af­fect how fast your pho­tos are shared on­line and the qual­ity of video calls, did not see much of an im­prove­ment go­ing from 4G to 5G. In fact, there were oc­ca­sions when the 4G up­load speed was faster than the 5G one.</p>
    <p>While the in­crease in down­load speeds go­ing from 4G to 5G looked good in tests, the im­prove­ments in real-world ap­pli­ca­tions were less im­pres­sive.</p>
    <p>In our tests, it took about two min­utes to down­load a 400MB Net­flix video on the 5G net­work, com­pared with two min­utes 40 sec­onds on a 4G net­work. YouTube videos also took a frac­tion faster to load us­ing 5G.</p>
    <p>While the ben­e­fits of these early 5G net­works may not be ground­break­ing, Mr Mohsin Sha­farud­din says he has so far been sat­is­fied with his ex­pe­ri­ence on Sing­tel’s 5G net­work.</p>
    <p>The 31-year-old per­sonal trainer is among the 20,000 Sing­tel cus­tomers who have been given 5G con­nec­tiv­ity and 10GB of ad­di­tional lo­cal data for free for a three­month trial.</p>
    <p>He says his Net­flix videos now play in­stantly with­out buffer­ing. The avid mo­bile gamer, who plays on­line mul­ti­player game Mo­bile Leg­ends on his 5G hand­set, adds: “Since I started us­ing the 5G net­work a few days ago, I have yet to be dis­con­nected while gam­ing.”</p>
    <p>Sing­tel and StarHub’s tri­als end in Fe­bru­ary next year, while M1’s is un­til March.</p>
    <p>Mr Ian Fogg, vice-pres­i­dent of anal­y­sis at mo­bile an­a­lyt­ics com­pany Opensignal, says: “The faster down­load speeds ex­pe­ri­enced by users is typ­i­cal of early 5G net­works.</p>
    <p>“We have com­pared 5G speeds across coun­tries glob­ally and found a wide vari­ance in the 5G down­load speed ex­pe­ri­ence, rang­ing from 14.3 times faster than 4G to 1.4 times faster, de­pend­ing on the coun­try.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ling Kan­grui, an an­a­lyst at mar­ket re­search firm ABI Re­search, notes that while the uses cited by tel­cos such as cloud gam­ing and live-stream­ing of events fea­tur­ing aug­mented re­al­ity or vir­tual re­al­ity are fea­si­ble with cur­rent 5G net­works, the ecosys­tem for them is not ready yet.</p>
    <p>“SK Tele­com and KT in South Korea are al­ready launch­ing their own 5G cloud gam­ing plat­forms and pack­ages, but this re­quires ad­di­tional in­vest­ments and a de­man­dready mar­ket,” he says.</p>
