    <p>Who’s big­ger: China or the United States? And why does it mat­ter?</p>
    <p>The eas­i­est mea­sure is pop­u­la­tion: China has 1.4 bil­lion; the US has 330 mil­lion. No de­bate here. If the whole world were a democ­racy, China would have four times as many vot­ers as the US, al­though China is ex­pected to lose that dis­tinc­tion to In­dia within a decade.</p>
    <p>Another mea­sure on which there ap­pears to be a con­sen­sus is mil­i­tary power, hard power.</p>
    <p>The US ad­van­tage in nu­clear weapons may not be rel­e­vant, as both coun­tries have enough to de­stroy the world.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, China’s mil­i­tary power is grow­ing vis­i­bly year by year. Espe­cially mea­sured against the num­ber of Amer­i­can mil­i­tary per­son­nel on duty in for­eign coun­tries, the trend for the US is down. The US has a clear ad­van­tage in air power and prob­a­bly space power. Harder to as­sess is cy­ber war­fare power.</p>
    <p>In terms of numbers of ves­sels, the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army Navy is the largest navy in the world, with 350 ships and sub­marines com­pared with the US Navy’s bat­tle force of 293 ves­sels.</p>
    <p>The hard­est kind of big­ness to mea­sure is soft power. It is hard to mea­sure be­cause it takes many sub­tle forms – such as in mu­sic, movies, sports and ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>These are ac­tiv­i­ties that in­flu­ence opin­ions glob­ally about coun­tries, dis­tin­guish­ing one from another.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, in the case of the US and China, they in­flu­ence the ex­tent to which each coun­try is con­sid­ered to be a friendly one.</p>
    <p>As an Amer­i­can, it is not easy to be ob­jec­tive, but there is a lot of ev­i­dence sug­gest­ing that the US is a lap or two ahead of China in soft power. The in­creas­ing use of English around the world may be the in­di­ca­tor that pro­vides the strong­est ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>One rea­son why it mat­ters which coun­try is ahead in this race is be­cause China’s rise has be­come so prom­i­nent in for­eign pol­icy de­bates around the world.</p>
    <p>There is a pal­pa­ble con­cern, espe­cially in the West, that China rep­re­sents a threat to other coun­tries, that it is mak­ing progress in es­tab­lish­ing hege­mony over the rest of the world.</p>
    <p>There is also a sense that only the US is in a po­si­tion to stop China from tak­ing over the world. One man­i­fes­ta­tion of this view is an es­say, An An­swer To Ag­gres­sion: How To Push Back Against Bei­jing by Prince­ton Univer­sity pro­fes­sor Aaron L. Fried­berg, in the Septem­ber-Oc­to­ber is­sue of For­eign Af­fairs magazine, ar­gu­ing that the US must in­crease im­mi­gra­tion to stay ahead of</p>
    <p>China power-wise.</p>
    <p>DRAW­BACKS OF A ZERO SUM AP­PROACH</p>
    <p>Like other schol­ars who view China pri­mar­ily as a threat, Prof Fried­berg ap­pears to have a “zero-sum” view of US-China re­la­tions: The US is ei­ther a win­ner or a loser. There is no mid­dle ground.</p>
    <p>This can­not pos­si­bly be a smart ap­proach. There has to be a win-win op­tion. It may not be easy to iden­tify and pur­sue. It prob­a­bly will not be em­braced quickly by China and yield short-term re­sults. It will need to be com­pre­hen­sive and nu­anced, re­flect­ing the com­plex­i­ties of the US-China re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>One pit­fall of a zero-sum ap­proach is that it eas­ily trans­lates into treat­ing China as “the en­emy”.</p>
    <p>Since the 9/11 ter­ror­ist at­tacks in 2001, com­pounded by the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis in 2007-2008, it feels like Wash­ing­ton has made more en­e­mies than friends among the roughly 200 coun­tries in the world, espe­cially in the Mid­dle East (Syria, Libya), and more re­cently in Mex­ico and other Latin Amer­i­can coun­tries that are sources of refugees seek­ing asy­lum in the US.</p>
    <p>The only other time since</p>
    <p>World War II when this was ar­guably the case was be­tween 1968 and 1975, when the coun­try was mired in the Viet­nam War.</p>
    <p>A US pol­icy that seeks to make China a friend has to be bet­ter up to the point where Bei­jing acts to es­tab­lish con­trol of another coun­try. This does not re­quire ap­pease­ment. While seek­ing friend­ship, it is still im­por­tant to re­act vig­or­ously to ac­tions such as China’s mil­i­tari­sa­tion of the South China Sea and its treat­ment of the Uighurs.</p>
    <p>The US’ re­ac­tions, how­ever, will only stand a chance of nudg­ing China to­wards be­ing a more re­spon­si­ble power if they are thought­ful, sur­gi­cal and ef­fec­tively ex­plained. In­ter­me­di­ate stages on the route to friendly re­la­tions are co­op­er­a­tion and part­ner­ship in ad­dress­ing spe­cific is­sues – from trade pol­icy to global dis­tri­bu­tion of Covid-19 vac­cines.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, any push­back by Wash­ing­ton that is purely bi­lat­eral is likely to be shrugged off by Bei­jing. The more any push­back is mul­ti­lat­eral, the more likely it is to suc­ceed. It could even be the case that mul­ti­lat­eral ef­forts to push back against Chi­nese ac­tions will be most suc­cess­ful when they are led by other coun­tries or groups of coun­tries, such as Asean, with sup­port from the US.</p>
    <p>One of the most use­less ways of persuading China to be­have more re­spon­si­bly is to harp on spe­cific re­forms that the coun­try “must” un­der­take.</p>
    <p>Think about it.</p>
    <p>Does not the US dis­miss out of hand ap­peals from for­eign­ers to fix its own elec­toral sys­tem or its health sys­tem?</p>
    <p>Why would China re­act any dif­fer­ently?</p>
    <p>THE SMARTER AP­PROACH</p>
    <p>In­stead, the smarter ap­proach is to high­light China’s in­ter­nal prob­lems and short­com­ings, and chal­lenge the coun­try’s lead­ers to fix them, fol­low­ing the fa­mous dic­tum by former pa­tri­arch Deng Xiaop­ing: It does not mat­ter whether a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice. Not only with China, it would be a good idea for US for­eign pol­icy to fo­cus less on “democ­racy” and more on “good gov­er­nance”.</p>
    <p>Here are two el­e­ments of a po­ten­tially win-win US pol­icy to­wards China that would be an im­prove­ment over cur­rent pol­icy.</p>
    <p>One is to work harder at un­der­stand­ing the coun­try, by en­cour­ag­ing China stud­ies in US col­leges and uni­ver­si­ties, by sup­port­ing the teach­ing of Mandarin in pri­mary and sec­ondary schools, by pro­mot­ing pro­grammes – like the Peace Corps and the Ful­bright Schol­ar­ships – that put Amer­i­cans into Chi­nese com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­cans will fail in help­ing China be­come a re­spected global leader if they do not un­der­stand its his­tory, its cul­ture and its con­tra­dic­tions.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond el­e­ment is to ex­pand peo­ple-to-peo­ple en­gage­ment in ev­ery form – from tourism to “sis­ter city” part­ner­ships.</p>
    <p>Ob­sta­cles faced by Chi­nese stu­dents who want to study at col­leges and uni­ver­si­ties in the US, espe­cially those pre­pared to pay the costs in full, are self-de­feat­ing. The risks of hav­ing in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty stolen by Chi­nese re­searchers can­not be ig­nored, but pre­ven­tive mea­sures can be taken with­out se­ri­ously com­pro­mis­ing the over­all ben­e­fits of hav­ing the stu­dents ex­pe­ri­ence the re­al­ity of life in the US, which is far re­moved from the im­pres­sions these young men and women would have if they stayed at home and got what they knew about the US from gov­ern­ment-con­trolled me­dia and gov­ern­ment-ap­proved school cur­ric­ula.</p>
    <p>By far the most im­por­tant steps the US can take to meet “the China chal­lenge”, how­ever, are to make the US po­lit­i­cal sys­tem less dys­func­tional, to make US so­ci­ety more har­mo­nious and to get the US econ­omy back on track. If Amer­i­cans fail to get their act to­gether, China will not be the only for­eign threat to the well-be­ing of Amer­i­cans, their grand­chil­dren, and their grand­chil­dren’s grand­chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Some­thing else to think about is how much flak the US takes as the world’s lead­ing power. A good amount of the flak the coun­try has been tak­ing is likely to shift to China as its econ­omy con­tin­ues to out­pace the US econ­omy. Grow­ing crit­i­cism of China around the world may do more to nudge Bei­jing to­wards be­ing a re­spon­si­ble power than any set of US poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, there is one point made by Prof Fried­berg at the be­gin­ning of his es­say worth re­peat­ing here: “... it would be fool­ish to premise US strat­egy on ‘de­ter­min­ing a par­tic­u­lar end state for China’.”</p>
    <p>In other words, any­one who be­lieves they know what China will look like 50 years from now is delu­sional. What the world will look like in 50 years – given cur­rent de­mo­graphic and tech­nol­ogy trends in the con­text of global warm­ing – is a wild guess at best.</p>
    <p>US na­tional se­cu­rity in the near term de­pends on adopt­ing poli­cies ad­dress­ing near-term chal­lenges, not as­pi­ra­tional goals like mak­ing China a democ­racy mod­elled on Amer­ica.</p>
