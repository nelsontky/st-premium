    <p>Pop­u­lar pub­lic spots such as beaches and bars will see en­hanced crowd con­trols and stricter en­force­ment against those who flout safe man­age­ment rules, the task force on Covid-19 said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Five weeks into phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing, the au­thor­i­ties said there have been crowd­ing and poor ad­her­ence to safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures at places such as stretches of East Coast Park and food and bev­er­age out­lets at places like Dempsey.</p>
    <p>More than 100 fines were is­sued last week­end to those who failed to ad­here to safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures. Two bars at Cir­cu­lar Road have been fined and is­sued sus­pen­sion no­tices.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong called on the com­mu­nity to stay dis­ci­plined and to keep up prac­tices such as mask­ing up in pub­lic. Those with any symp­toms should see a doc­tor rather than self-med­i­cate. About 40 per cent of com­mu­nity cases had con­tin­ued to move about in pub­lic af­ter ex­hibit­ing symp­toms, be­hav­iour that jeop­ar­dises the col­lec­tive ef­fort against Covid-19, he said.</p>
    <p>The task force said clear­ance of Covid-19 at for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries here should be com­pleted within a fort­night, ex­cept for 17 stand­alone blocks in some dorms that are be­ing used as quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Five weeks into phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing, lapses into old habits and weak links have prompted a retight­en­ing of safety and en­force­ment mea­sures at hot spots to pre­vent a spike in new Covid-19 in­fec­tions, the au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>Pop­u­lar nightspots, beaches, malls and parks are some of the places where there has been crowd­ing, and where safe dis­tanc­ing rules such as keep­ing to groups of five or fewer have not been well ob­served.</p>
    <p>The start of the school hol­i­days last week­end in­creased the num­bers at beaches and parks, while restau­rants and bars in places such as Hol­land Vil­lage, Dempsey, Robert­son Quay and Cir­cu­lar Road con­tinue to be closely mon­i­tored for breaches, Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, two food and bev­er­age out­lets in Cir­cu­lar Road – Los Ami­gos and Try Again – were fined and sus­pended in the past week for host­ing groups of more than five de­spite hav­ing been is­sued warn­ings.</p>
    <p>Last week­end, the Na­tional Parks Board also handed out over 100 fines to in­di­vid­u­als who failed to ob­serve safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures at gar­dens, parks and na­ture re­serves.</p>
    <p>Among the tighter con­trol mea­sures to be im­ple­mented are ca­pac­ity lim­its, such as at beaches.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cers will man con­trol points at the en­trances and turn away vis­i­tors when they as­sess an area to be close to ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>Carparks serv­ing these places will also be closed and traf­fic redi­rected be­fore they fill up, said Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong asked Sin­ga­pore­ans to bear with the mea­sures, which are aimed at pre­serv­ing pub­lic health.</p>
    <p>He also urged those with symp­toms of acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion not to self-med­i­cate and hope it blows over on its own, but to see a doc­tor im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>About 40 per cent of com­mu­nity cases have en­gaged in ac­tiv­i­ties such as vis­it­ing shop­ping cen­tres af­ter the on­set of symp­toms, and of these, one-third con­tin­ued to go to work.</p>
    <p>“Such be­hav­iour jeop­ar­dises our col­lec­tive ef­forts to fight Covid-19 and could lead to in­fec­tions of loved ones, friends and col­leagues,” said Mr Gan, who is also co-chair­man of the Covid-19 task force.</p>
    <p>“We urge ev­ery­one to see a doc­tor early if you feel un­well and to stay at home through­out the du­ra­tion of your med­i­cal leave or be­fore your swab re­sults come back.”</p>
    <p>Peo­ple must re­main vig­i­lant not just in pub­lic, but also in pri­vate set­tings, to pre­vent a new wave of in­fec­tions hap­pen­ing, said Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tions can hap­pen not only at malls and bars, but also “in places that are not so vis­i­ble, be­cause peo­ple are vis­it­ing one an­other in their homes”, he noted, es­pe­cially if the rule on group lim­its is flouted.</p>
    <p>“If there are peo­ple who do not com­ply with the rules and you have large groups of peo­ple com­ing to visit one an­other... that may not be vis­i­ble, may not be on so­cial me­dia, you may not have pic­tures pub­li­cised, but, in the end, you’re putting your­self and your own friends and fam­ily mem­bers at risk,” he said.</p>
    <p>While the Gov­ern­ment has stepped up ef­forts to en­sure peo­ple ob­serve safe dis­tanc­ing and en­hanced crowd con­trol mea­sures at hot spots, Sin­ga­pore­ans should not rely on en­force­ment to be so­cially re­spon­si­ble, said Mr Gan.</p>
    <p>“In this new Covid nor­mal that we need to move to, the role of the in­di­vid­ual is cru­cial,” he said. “Fight­ing the virus re­quires sig­nif­i­cant shifts in be­hav­iour and mind­set.</p>
    <p>“Some of these changes may be in­con­ve­nient or even painful, but we can change our so­cial norms if we make a col­lec­tive ef­fort by each play­ing our part.”</p>
