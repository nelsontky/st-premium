    <p>Be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic, Sin­ga­pore’s 200km sys­tem of more than 130 sta­tions across six MRT lines span­ning the is­land, had a daily rid­er­ship of more than three mil­lion.</p>
    <p>To­day, com­mut­ing habits have changed. Many peo­ple now work or at­tend classes from home, and in­ter­na­tional travel has been put on hold. These shifts are a stark re­minder of the un­prece­dented chal­lenges and dis­rup­tions to Sin­ga­pore’s trans­port in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>To meet these chal­lenges, the SGRail In­dus­try Schol­ar­ships hope to at­tract fu­ture lead­ers who can en­vi­sion, build and shape the fu­ture of the rail sec­tor. The schol­ar­ships, which were an­nounced last year, pro­vide ex­po­sure to a di­verse range of ca­reers, in which schol­ar­ship hold­ers play key roles in shap­ing best prac­tices.</p>
    <p>Schol­ar­ship hold­ers will also meet like-minded in­di­vid­u­als who are pas­sion­ate about in­no­va­tion in the en­gi­neer­ing and rail­way fields, such as Mr Vishal Gane­san, 27, an SMRT man­ager who is now part of the Thom­son Line Per­ma­nent Way Project team, which is “re­spon­si­ble for en­sur­ing the track­work as­sets are taken over in a main­tain­able and op­er­a­ble con­di­tion from the var­i­ous con­trac­tors in­volved”.</p>
    <p>Mr Vishal joined SMRT right af­ter grad­u­at­ing, drawn by the rail op­er­a­tor’s vi­sion to en­sure that for eight in 10 Sin­ga­pore house­holds, an MRT sta­tion would be lo­cated only a 10-minute walk away.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing an in­tern­ship in the rail in­dus­try, he re­alised that the seem­ingly sim­ple goal was an am­bi­tious tar­get. The chal­lenge of be­ing able to work on such mas­sive projects held his fas­ci­na­tion through­out his un­der­grad­u­ate stud­ies in me­chan­i­cal en­gi­neer­ing at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Nat­u­rally, upon grad­u­a­tion, I wanted to join the in­dus­try and SMRT’s en­gi­neer­ing man­age­ment as­so­ciate pro­gramme ac­cepted me. There has been no look­ing back since,” he proudly says.</p>
    <p>In the more than five years that Mr Vishal has worked with SMRT, he has been given a wide range of op­por­tu­ni­ties, such as green­field projects for new con­struc­tion, and brown­field projects, from re­new­ing ex­ist­ing lines to main­te­nance en­gi­neer­ing. He has also worked on the three ma­jor lines that SMRT op­er­ates — North-South and East-West Lines, Cir­cle Line, and Thom­son-East Coast Line.</p>
    <p>Ms Kellen, 35, a rolling stock engi­neer at SBS Tran­sit (SBST ), calls the rail sec­tor “a ca­reer for life”. Two years ago, she left the pay­ments in­dus­try to ex­plore a new pro­fes­sional path in the rail in­dus­try, de­spite not hav­ing prior ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>She says the switch has been im­mensely re­ward­ing. She is cur­rently working on SBST’s ma­jor mid-life re­fur­bish­ment project, which in­volves re­plac­ing worn-out com­po­nents. Her job scope in­cludes mon­i­tor­ing project mile­stones, time­lines and their de­liv­er­ables, and com­mu­ni­cat­ing with in­ter­nal and ex­ter­nal stake­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>The work is not al­ways a smooth ride, but it is an op­por­tu­nity she rel­ishes as it has given her “a sense of ac­com­plish­ment”, she says.</p>
    <p>As Sin­ga­pore’s rail in­dus­try speed­ily trans­forms and pro­gresses, Mr Vishal be­lieves the field is not just for en­gi­neers. In­stead, “it’s a re­ally big puz­zle and we need peo­ple of var­i­ous back­grounds to com­plete the puz­zle”.</p>
    <p>And he is hope­ful of the sec­tor’s fu­ture, even in a world reel­ing from a dev­as­tat­ing pan­demic. He says: “It is a ‘sun­rise in­dus­try’</p>
    <p>one that sets am­bi­tious plans, has a well-crafted road map, and is well and truly on its way to achiev­ing those goals.”</p>
