    <p>PRAGUE • World No. 3 Karolina Pliskova said on Fri­day that she was look­ing for­ward to play­ing at the US Open at the end of this month, buck­ing a wave of with­drawals due to coro­n­avirus con­cerns.</p>
    <p>“Even though I keep think­ing the sit­u­a­tion is chang­ing every day, no­body knows what will come, but I re­ally be­lieve we will play,” the 28-year-old told the Czech News Agency.</p>
    <p>Her words are in stark con­trast to a series of with­drawals from the tour­na­ment held in a coun­try which has been hit the worst by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Top 10 play­ers Elina Svi­tolina and Kiki Bertens on Fri­day be­came the lat­est to an­nounce they were skip­ping the tour­na­ment. An­other player who has with­drawn is world No. 1 Ash­leigh Barty.</p>
    <p>Four-time US Open cham­pion Rafael Nadal is also stay­ing at home, while Stan Wawrinka and Nick Kyrgios have said they will give the Grand Slam a miss.</p>
    <p>Other big-name play­ers who are still un­de­cided on their par­tic­i­pa­tion in­clude No­vak Djokovic, Ser­ena Wil­liams, Andy Mur­ray and Alexan­der Zverev.</p>
    <p>Pliskova has a spe­cial fond­ness for the New York event in which she reached the fi­nal in 2016, her best Ma­jor re­sult to date.</p>
    <p>“The worst-case sce­nario would be if we left and they sent us back. We’ve al­ready had this ex­pe­ri­ence,” she said.</p>
    <p>In March, Pliskova trav­elled to the United States – only to find out the Mi­ami and In­dian Wells tour­na­ments were scrapped over the virus out­break.</p>
    <p>She also waved aside the ex­pected tight se­cu­rity mea­sures at Flush­ing Mead­ows.</p>
    <p>“I’ve de­cided I want to play and this shouldn’t be a prob­lem,” said</p>
    <p>Pliskova, who even found an ad­van­tage to the planned re­stric­tions. “I’m pretty tired. So I’m look­ing for­ward to clos­ing my door... and be­ing alone in my room for 24 hours.”</p>
    <p>Pliskova is skip­ping this week’s WTA tour­na­ment in Prague, just like fel­low Czech Karolina Mu­chova, the world No. 26, who is also get­ting ready for a trip to New York.</p>
    <p>“Con­sid­er­ing the cal­en­dar, we have started train­ing on a hard court ahead of the trip to Amer­ica and a tour­na­ment on clay doesn’t re­ally fit the plan,” Mu­chova, who reached the third round in New York in the last two years, said in a state­ment.</p>
