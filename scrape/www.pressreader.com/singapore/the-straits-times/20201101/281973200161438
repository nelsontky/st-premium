    <p>For­mal and in­for­mal men­tor­ship and sup­port net­works in the work­place would pro­vide a boost to women in their ca­reer de­vel­op­ment, di­a­logue par­tic­i­pants said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Around 60 lead­ers from var­i­ous women’s or­gan­i­sa­tions took part in the sec­ond Con­ver­sa­tions on Women’s De­vel­op­ment di­a­logue, which was or­gan­ised by the Sin­ga­pore Coun­cil of Women’s Or­gan­i­sa­tions and held vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to re­porters af­ter the di­a­logue, Min­is­ter of State for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment Sun Xuel­ing said that for­mal­is­ing men­tor­ship pro­grammes in or­gan­i­sa­tions could help de­velop a pipe­line of women lead­ers.</p>
    <p>“Through such pro­grammes, em­ploy­ees who are women in the com­pany can ben­e­fit from ex­changes, knowl­edge shar­ing and also plug­ging into net­works, which will be ben­e­fi­cial for their per­sonal de­vel­op­ment,” she said.</p>
    <p>For­mal pro­grammes to help women ease back into the work­place af­ter they have spent some time away is also some­thing which should be ac­tively thought about, Ms Sun said.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese can be done in part­ner­ship with com­pa­nies, be­cause there are women who are very tal­ented, very skilled in cer­tain pro­fes­sions, and all that is miss­ing at this point could be that they have taken sev­eral years off work and they have a gap in their CV (cur­ricu­lum vi­tae),” she added.</p>
    <p>The Con­ver­sa­tions on Women’s De­vel­op­ment di­a­logue se­ries looks to gather feed­back on is­sues that af­fect women at home, in school, in the work­place and in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Over 100 con­ver­sa­tions are ex­pected to be held, and they will be led by part­ner or­gan­i­sa­tions, in­clud­ing trade as­so­ci­a­tions and stu­dent bod­ies, said Ms Sun.</p>
    <p>“We will in­clude young and old, men and women (in th­ese ses­sions) be­cause this is go­ing to be a move­ment. It is a na­tional re­view for us to be able to move for­ward to­gether, we are go­ing to need every­one’s in­put, and also every­one’s buy-in,” she said.</p>
    <p>The ideas and sug­ges­tions from th­ese dis­cus­sions will form the ba­sis of a White Pa­per to be de­liv­ered in the first half of next year.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral di­a­logue par­tic­i­pants feel the pres­ence of in­for­mal sup­port net­works would help women in the work­place, said Ms Linda Schindler, a board mem­ber of the Amer­i­can Women’s As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>It would help that “we know that other women are go­ing through the same thing and you don’t have to feel guilty that you can’t do it all, (and to know) how other women are deal­ing with the dif­fer­ent chal­lenges they are fac­ing”, she said.</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing on this, Ms Sun said that in­for­mal net­works could have an im­por­tant role to play in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Th­ese could al­low women to of­fer ad­vice and sup­port to one an­other dur­ing tran­si­tion pe­ri­ods of their lives, such as when their chil­dren are go­ing to start school, and this could help them ad­dress chal­lenges that they face, she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Harmin Kaur, a board mem­ber at United Women Sin­ga­pore, said that par­tic­i­pants also dis­cussed the im­por­tance of be­ing aware of how un­con­scious bi­ases start from a young age.</p>
    <p>“The sug­ges­tion was to have school teach­ers, early child­hood ed­u­ca­tors, be trained to recog­nise un­con­scious bi­ases in them­selves, so that they can recog­nise it when it hap­pens in the class­room be­cause it is not al­ways overt,” she said, adding that this would al­low them to in­ter­vene when nec­es­sary.</p>
