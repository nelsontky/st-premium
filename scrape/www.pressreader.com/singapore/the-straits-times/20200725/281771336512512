    <p>One of the three Covid-19 com­mu­nity cases an­nounced yes­ter­day was linked to three pre­vi­ous cases, form­ing a new clus­ter at Bukit Pan­jang In­te­grated Trans­port Hub.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, there were 277 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 49,375.</p>
    <p>They in­cluded the three com­mu­nity cases, all of whom are work per­mit hold­ers, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>The fig­ure was up­dated from five an­nounced in the af­ter­noon, as two cases were re­clas­si­fied fol­low­ing con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>There were also two im­ported coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Both were de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers and were placed on stay-home no­tice upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore from In­dia on July 12. They were tested while serv­ing their no­tice.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers in dor­mi­to­ries made up the 272 re­main­ing cases.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from 11 cases two weeks ago to eight in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from the daily av­er­age of six cases two weeks ago to the daily av­er­age of four in the past week.</p>
    <p>MOH also added sev­eral new lo­ca­tions to a list of places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were still in­fec­tious: Hil­lion Mall in Bukit Pan­jang and the My Briyani House eatery there, Jem mall’s Robin­sons out­let, and the Gandhi Restau­rant in Chan­der Road in Lit­tle In­dia.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions and times that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes to get those who were at these places at spe­cific pe­ri­ods to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>MOH has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned, if needed.</p>
    <p>With 157 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 45,157 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 157 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, while 4,019 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. None is in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from 11 cases two weeks ago to eight in the past week.</p>
