    <p>One Esports chief ex­ec­u­tive Car­los Alimu­rung said the ubiq­uity of smart­phones is why he be­lieves that mo­bile games are the fu­ture of e-sports, and that South-east Asia will have a big role to play in lead­ing the way. He was speak­ing in a vir­tual ses­sion at the All That Mat­ters busi­ness fes­ti­val yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>While do­ing a road show in the Philip­pines, Car­los Alimu­rung, chief ex­ec­u­tive of One Esports, the on­line gam­ing arm of mixed mar­tial arts or­gan­i­sa­tion One Cham­pi­onship, was in­tro­duced to an un­fa­mil­iar mo­bile phone man­u­fac­turer. He soon found out it was one of the big­gest smart­phone brands in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Af­ter dis­cov­er­ing that the com­pany owned 80 per cent of the mar­ket share of phones un­der US$150 (S$204), Alimu­rung re­alised that many e-sports fans in the re­gion were re­ly­ing on their phones to tune into and play games.</p>
    <p>The ubiq­uity of smart­phones is why he be­lieves that mo­bile games are the fu­ture of e-sports and that the re­gion will have a big role to play in lead­ing the way.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at a vir­tual ses­sion at the All That Mat­ters busi­ness fes­ti­val yes­ter­day, he said: “That was this re­al­i­sa­tion that I had com­ing to South-east Asia – the next gen­er­a­tion of fans are these peo­ple who want to ac­cess these sports and who are in­ter­act­ing with it through a mo­bile phone.</p>
    <p>“This cen­tury is a very dif­fer­ent cen­tury in terms of who is val­i­dat­ing en­ter­tain­ment me­dia.</p>
    <p>“Ten to 20 years ago, frankly, it was the West who was val­i­dat­ing what’s cool but that game is over; Asia is de­ter­min­ing what is cool and what is hot.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to e-sports an­a­lyt­ics and mar­ket re­search firm New­zoo, South-east Asia is the world’s fastest grow­ing games mar­ket with the re­gion’s mo­bile games mar­ket ac­count­ing for US$3.1 bil­lion (S$4.2 bil­lion) of the 2019 games rev­enue of US$4.4 bil­lion – over 70 per cent of the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>South-east Asia’s In­ter­net pen­e­tra­tion rate was 63 per cent early last year, up from 25 per cent in 2014. And global re­search firm Statista re­ported that the num­ber of mo­bile gamers in the re­gion, which has a pop­u­la­tion of over 669 mil­lion, is ex­pected to hit 250.6 mil­lion next year.</p>
    <p>E-sports has be­come in­creas­ingly ac­cepted in the re­gion, with the sport mak­ing its bow at last year’s SEA Games in the Philip­pines, where Sin­ga­pore won a bronze and sil­ver in Hearth­stone and Star­craft II re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The growth of e-sports has also been ac­cel­er­ated by the coron­avirus pan­demic, which caused tra­di­tional sport to come to a stand­still ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>This has seen more e-sports leagues and pub­lish­ers i n Asia push­ing for TV rev­enue rights, some­thing that fel­low pan­el­list Sean Zhang, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Hong Kong-based Talon Esports, feels is a pos­i­tive step for­ward.</p>
    <p>“It is good thing be­cause it sus­tains busi­nesses and teams. Push­ing more into a tra­di­tional sports space and you’ve seen that in the United States with TV rights, spon­sor­ship, be­ing part own­ers of the league and work­ing with pub­lish­ers to de­velop and grow that pie and shared ben­e­fits, there are some in­ter­est­ing things hap­pen­ing there,” he said.</p>
    <p>“A lot of in­ter­est­ing pub­lish­ers are fo­cus­ing down that di­rec­tion, which has helped a lot with mon­eti­sa­tion so you’re not solely re­liant on spon­sor­ship dol­lars.”</p>
