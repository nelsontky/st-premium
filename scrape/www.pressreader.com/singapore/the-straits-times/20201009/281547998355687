    <p>United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, con­fined to the White House where he is be­ing treated for Covid-19, has said he does not be­lieve he is con­ta­gious, and is feel­ing good enough to re­sume cam­paign ral­lies as he tries to boost his flag­ging re-elec­tion bid.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, con­fined to the White House where he is be­ing treated for Covid-19, has said he does not be­lieve he is con­ta­gious and is feel­ing good enough to re­sume cam­paign ral­lies as he tries to boost his flag­ging re-elec­tion bid.</p>
    <p>“I’m back be­cause I’m a per­fect phys­i­cal spec­i­men,” he told Fox Business Net­work’s Maria Bar­tiromo yes­ter­day in his first in­ter­view since it was re­vealed nearly a week ago that he had tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s con­tention he was no longer con­ta­gious was not yet backed up by solid ev­i­dence from his doc­tors. The White House has re­fused to say when his last neg­a­tive test for the virus was and, as a re­sult, it is un­clear how long he has been pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent is un­der pres­sure to ac­tively cam­paign again to try to in­ject new en­ergy into his re-elec­tion bid as he faces a deficit in opinion polls in bat­tle­ground states, with elec­tion day now less than four weeks away.</p>
    <p>“I’m feel­ing good, re­ally good,” said Mr Trump, who spent three nights be­ing treated at a mil­i­tary hos­pi­tal out­side Washington un­til his dis­charge on Mon­day. He said he had stopped tak­ing “most ther­a­peu­tics” for the virus but was still on steroids.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent has faced crit­i­cism for un­der­es­ti­mat­ing the coro­n­avirus, which has killed more than 210,000 Amer­i­cans and thrown mil­lions out of work. Even since re­veal­ing his own ill­ness last week, he has down­played the res­pi­ra­tory dis­ease’s dan­gers and been cen­sured by so­cial me­dia plat­forms for spread­ing mis­in­for­ma­tion about it.</p>
    <p>The Fox Business Net­work in­ter­view was con­ducted over the phone. Mr Trump him­self has not been seen in pub­lic since he ar­rived back at the White House from the hos­pi­tal on Mon­day night.</p>
    <p>But he is aim­ing to re­turn to the cam­paign trail with an event as early as next Mon­day in Penn­syl­va­nia, and trips to Michi­gan and Florida later in the week, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>It would be the first time he is trav­el­ling since he was di­ag­nosed with the coro­n­avirus on Oct 1.</p>
    <p>The events are ten­ta­tive at this point and the plans are sub­ject to change, the sources said. The cur­rent plan would see Mr Trump trav­el­ling to Penn­syl­va­nia next Mon</p>
    <p>WHAT HE BE­LIEVES</p>
    <p>day and Michi­gan next Tues­day.</p>
    <p>He could pos­si­bly, next Fri­day, hold a cam­paign event in Mi­ami where he was pre­vi­ously sched­uled to have his sec­ond de­bate against Demo­crat nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den, the sources said.</p>
    <p>Be­fore Mr Trump was stricken with the coro­n­avirus, his cam­paign’s strat­egy re­lied heav­ily on his ap­pear­ances in key swing states to stoke en­thu­si­asm among his sup­port­ers, cull key voter data and dom­i­nate lo­cal news cov­er­age, amount­ing to free ad­ver­tis­ing in those ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has been ea­ger to demon­strate that he is back at work, but White House physi­cian Sean Con­ley said on Mon­day that it is pos­si­ble the Pres­i­dent could be in­fec­tious for more than 10 days.</p>
    <p>“The big first thing that we need to do is make sure that there is no ev­i­dence of live virus still present that he could pos­si­bly trans­mit to oth­ers,” Dr Con­ley told re­porters who asked when Mr Trump could re­turn to the cam­paign trail.</p>
    <p>I’m back be­cause I’m a per­fect phys­i­cal spec­i­men.</p>
