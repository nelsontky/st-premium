    <p>An­other strong fin­ish on Wall Street on Fri­day gave lo­cal in­vestors the in­cen­tive to start the week on a pos­i­tive note yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It pushed the bench­mark Straits Times In­dex (STI) up 0.77 per cent or 19.46 points to 2,552.42, with gain­ers out­pac­ing losers 272 to 174 on trade of 1.4 bil­lion shares worth $1 bil­lion. Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries came out tops among the STI con­stituents, gain­ing 3.01 per cent to $1.37. Other top STI per­form­ers in­cluded Com­fortDelGro, ahead 2.07 per cent, and Ven­ture Cor­po­ra­tion, which gained 1.92 per cent.</p>
    <p>RHB an­a­lyst Shekhar Jaiswal said in an Oct 7 re­port that Com­fortDelGro “should ben­e­fit from grad­ual im­prove­ments in pub­lic trans­port rid­er­ship and in­crease in its taxi util­i­sa­tion, as the coun­try en­ters Phase 3 of re­open­ing the econ­omy”.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment was told last week that de­tails of a Phase 3 road map will be re­leased “in the com­ing weeks”.</p>
    <p>The trio of banks also ended the day up. DBS Bank gained 1.66 per cent to $21.40, OCBC Bank inched up 1.05 per cent to $8.68, while UOB ad­vanced 0.98 per cent to $19.64. UOB said in a bourse fil­ing yes­ter­day that its Syd­ney branch has priced A$500 mil­lion (S$489 mil­lion) of float­ing rate notes due in October 2023, which will fall un­der its US$15 bil­lion global medi­umterm note pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Dairy Farm In­ter­na­tional was top de­cliner for the day, fall­ing 1.29 per cent to US$3.83.</p>
    <p>Asian mar­kets ended the day mixed. Shang­hai shares rose 2.64 per cent while the Hang Seng In­dex tracked the main­land’s gains to end up 2.20 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Stephen Innes, Ax­iCorp’s chief global mar­kets strate­gist, said the ral­lies were “put down to ex­pec­ta­tions that Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s trip to Shen­zhen could re­veal more de­tailed pol­icy plans and fur­ther lib­er­al­i­sa­tion of the Chi­nese econ­omy”.</p>
    <p>The bench­mark Nikkei 225 in­dex fell 0.26 per cent but Aus­tralian stocks added 0.4 per cent to hit a seven-week high and the best six­day run since early June.</p>
    <p>In­vestors were cheered by talk that a Demo­crat clean sweep in the United States election next month will lead to a sig­nif­i­cant post-election stim­u­lus pack­age. US mar­kets were closed overnight for Colum­bus Day, but eyes are on the like­li­hood of ad­di­tional stim­u­lus as the world’s largest econ­omy strug­gles to re­cover from lock­downs that threw mil­lions of Amer­i­cans out of work.</p>
    <p>“The stim­u­lus game is still be­ing played out in the US right now and we don’t know how big or small it will be. We are just as­sum­ing that it will be some­thing,” Mr Brad Smol­ing, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor at Smol­ing Stock­broking, told Reuters.</p>
