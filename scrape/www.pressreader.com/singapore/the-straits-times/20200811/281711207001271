    <p>A three-year-old girl and three teenagers were among the 188 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>They were four of the 12 im­ported cases yes­ter­day. The girl, a de­pen­dant’s pass holder, is an In­dian na­tional. She was asymp­tomatic.</p>
    <p>Two of the teenagers had also ar­rived from In­dia, while the third ar­rived from the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>One of the two teenagers from In­dia is a 13-year-old per­ma­nent res­i­dent (PR). She ex­pe­ri­enced the on­set of symp­toms last Thurs­day. The other is a 14-year-old de­pen­dant’s pass holder. She was asymp­tomatic.</p>
    <p>The last teenager, who re­turned from the Philip­pines on July 29, is an 18-year-old Sin­ga­pore ci­ti­zen. He was asymp­tomatic.</p>
    <p>The eight other im­ported cases an­nounced yes­ter­day com­prise two PRs, one work pass holder, four work per­mit hold­ers and one de­pen­dant’s pass holder.</p>
    <p>The two PRs ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore sep­a­rately from In­dia and Bangladesh on July 29.</p>
    <p>All five work pass and work per­mit hold­ers are cur­rently em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore, and ar­rived here from the Philip­pines on July 29.</p>
    <p>The de­pen­dant’s pass holder ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore from In­dia.</p>
    <p>MOH said all of the im­ported pa­tients had been placed on 14-day stay-home no­tices upon ar­rival, and were serv­ing their no­tices at</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of two cases per day in the past two weeks. The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of one case per day over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>They tested pos­i­tive on Sun­day. The sole pa­tient in the com­mu­nity, a 60-year-old Sin­ga­porean man, was iden­ti­fied as a con­tact of a pre­vi­ously con­firmed case, and had been placed on quar­an­tine ear­lier. He was tested dur­ing his quar­an­tine, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 175 new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 55,292.</p>
    <p>MOH said four clus­ters in dor­mi­to­ries had been closed, as the dor­mi­to­ries were cleared and now house only re­cov­ered in­di­vid­u­als and those who have re­cently tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The min­istry added that there are cur­rently about 23,300 work­ers who are still serv­ing out their quar­an­tine pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of two cases per day in the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of one case per day over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 694 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 49,594 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the disease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 112 pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal, while 5,544 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. There is no pa­tient in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
