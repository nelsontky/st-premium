    <p>At least 200 pa­tients were wrongly di­ag­nosed by Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal with a more ag­gres­sive form of breast can­cer than they ac­tu­ally had. Some were given un­nec­es­sary treat­ment that likely cost tens of thou­sands of dol­lars for each of them. The re­sults of a retest for eight pa­tients are still pend­ing.</p>
    <p>At least 200 pa­tients were wrongly di­ag­nosed by Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal (KTPH) with a more ag­gres­sive form of breast can­cer than they ac­tu­ally had. Some were given un­nec­es­sary treat­ment that likely cost tens of thou­sands of dol­lars for each of them.</p>
    <p>The re­sults of a retest for eight pa­tients are still pend­ing.</p>
    <p>On Dec 11, KTPH dis­closed that about 180 pa­tients had been wrongly di­ag­nosed with HER-2 pos­i­tive breast can­cer, and that it was re­view­ing tests done since 2012.</p>
    <p>HER-2 is a less com­mon form of breast can­cer and gen­er­ally af­fects 15 per cent to 20 per cent of such pa­tients. The first and most com­monly used drug that tar­gets this type of can­cer is Her­ceptin.</p>
    <p>Re­ply­ing to ques­tions in Par­lia­ment from sev­eral MPs yes­ter­day, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Health Koh Poh Koon said com­mon side ef­fects are di­ar­rhoea, chills and fa­tigue. About 3 to 4 per cent of pa­tients may suf­fer heart prob­lems.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors are reach­ing out to af­fected pa­tients to help them and to as­sess any side ef­fects due to the drug, he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Ch­eryl Chan (East Coast GRC) asked why it took so long for the er­ror to be dis­cov­ered. Dr Koh replied that 6 per cent of pa­tients glob­ally are wrongly di­ag­nosed as hav­ing HER-2 pos­i­tive breast can­cer, which in­volves a highly com­plex test with­out a de­fin­i­tive an­swer.</p>
    <p>He said it takes a trained pathol­o­gist to make a judg­ment on the test re­sult. But this could be af­fected by the mul­ti­ple steps that re­quire hu­man in­ter­ven­tion, such as the con­cen­tra­tion of stains and how the tis­sue was han­dled.</p>
    <p>It re­quires a fairly large num­ber of re­sults to trig­ger an alert on the pos­si­bil­ity of a dis­pro­por­tion­ate num­ber of pa­tients be­ing di­ag­nosed with the con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Koh said the mis­takes were dis­cov­ered be­cause of the “in­sti­tu­tional process”. KTPH’s tu­mour board had flagged that the num­ber of HER-2 pos­i­tive cases was higher than nor­mal, lead­ing to the re­view.</p>
    <p>He added that re­views were done for pa­tients di­ag­nosed as hav­ing HER-2 pos­i­tive breast can­cer since 2012 be­cause that was when the hos­pi­tal first started do­ing such tests, and not be­cause er­rors had oc­curred then.</p>
    <p>Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sem­bawang GRC) and Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong GRC) asked about the ad­di­tional cost in­curred by af­fected pa­tients. Dr Tan, a can­cer spe­cial­ist, sug­gested that com­pen­sa­tion take into ac­count the time taken from work by a pa­tient or care­giver for the un­nec­es­sary treat­ment.</p>
    <p>Dr Koh said it was dif­fi­cult to give a fig­ure as the cost varies with in­di­vid­ual pa­tients. Fur­ther­more, he said not all the 200 pa­tients who were wrongly di­ag­nosed were given Her­ceptin. Some, he added, may have been too frail.</p>
    <p>KTPH had ear­lier said “about half of these pa­tients may have re­ceived un­nec­es­sary treat­ment for HER-2, usu­ally the drug Her­ceptin”.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that Her­ceptin costs $3,000 to $4,000 per cy­cle in the pub­lic sec­tor, and about $5,000 in the pri­vate sec­tor. Eight of the pa­tients given the wrong di­ag­no­sis were treated in pri­vate hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients are usu­ally treated for a year, and un­dergo 17 to 18 cy­cles. This comes to $50,000 to $70,000 per pa­tient in the pub­lic sec­tor.</p>
    <p>“The por­tion of the bills which arose from the un­nec­es­sary treat­ment will be fully re­funded,” said Dr Koh. Even dis­count­ing the sub­sidy that some of these pa­tients had re­ceived, the re­funds will likely be mil­lions of dol­lars.</p>
    <p>He also said “the pre­ferred state” for can­cer is over rather than un­der treat­ment, adding that not hav­ing HER-2 pos­i­tive can­cer means pa­tients have bet­ter prog­no­sis.</p>
    <p>Non-Con­stituency MP Hazel Poa asked if a life­time of free health­care is be­ing con­sid­ered as a form of com­pen­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Koh said that while costs re­lated to the wrong re­sults will be re­funded, “to then say that this trans­lates to a life­time of com­pen­sa­tion... will be a lit­tle bit too far to stretch”. Most com­pli­ca­tions, if any, are tran­sient, he said.</p>
    <p>“Di­ar­rhoea, fever or chills, they do not have long-term con­se­quences. They are not long-last­ing. We have to take that in the cur­rent con­text of med­i­cal treat­ment.”</p>
    <p>Dr Koh Poh Koon said the mis­takes were dis­cov­ered be­cause of the “in­sti­tu­tional process”. The hos­pi­tal’s tu­mour board had flagged that the num­ber of HER-2 pos­i­tive cases was higher than nor­mal, lead­ing to the re­view.</p>
