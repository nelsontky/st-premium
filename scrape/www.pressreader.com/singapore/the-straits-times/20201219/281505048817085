    <p>The Porsche Taycan has emerged as The Straits Times Car of the Year (COTY) 2020, with a score­card which knocks the prover­bial ball out of the park.</p>
    <p>The first electric car from the German mar­que has not only clinched the over­all top spot, but was also voted best in seven out of nine cat­e­gories. It l ost out only to the Hyundai Avante i n er­gonomics and value for money.</p>
    <p>Since the awards started 18 years ago, no other car has come close to this phe­nom­e­nal feat.</p>
    <p>And un­like some years, where the top car won by a thin mar­gin, the Taycan is streets ahead from its keen­est con­tender – the Land Rover De­fender.</p>
    <p>It scored 344 points, 33.3 per cent more than the De­fender’s 258. All the other con­tenders had a close fight.</p>
    <p>The third-high­est scorer is the Avante with 255 points, which is 1.2 per cent lower than the De­fender’s. Even the low­est-scor­ing Nissan Kicks (the t op choice among ST read­ers) is 29.6 per cent away from the run­ner-up’s score – a smaller gap than the one be­tween the No. 1 and No. 2 cars.</p>
    <p>The Taycan’s enor­mous l ead boils down to its unique su­pe­ri­or­ity. While electric cars are known to be quick and ef­fi­cient, they are of­ten clin­i­cal and ster­ile, lack­ing in emo­tion and warmth. The Taycan al­lows you to have your cake and eat it too.</p>
    <p>From the way it looks to the way it sounds to the way it moves, the grand tourer with a lower cen­tre of grav­ity than even the Porsche 911 more than matches the best among com­bus­tion-en­gined ri­vals.</p>
    <p>It is also ex­traor­di­nar­ily clever. With a mo­tor driv­ing each axle, the Taycan is a front-wheel-drive, a rear-wheel-drive and an all-wheeldrive rolled into one.</p>
    <p>The car seems to know which mode is best for the oc­ca­sion. This al­lows it to blast off with not a trace of wheel­spin yet al­lows the driver to in­dulge in play­ful an­tics such as dough­nuts and drift­ing. In fact, it holds the drift­ing record among electric cars.</p>
    <p>In rear-wheel mode, a two-speed trans­mis­sion (an­other unique fea­ture) of­fers the Taycan 4S the ef­fi­ciency of an e-car, a top velocity wor­thy of its name­plate (250kmh) and a four-sec­ond 0 to 100kmh sprint time which only a far costlier fourseater Porsche saloon can beat.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong Kai Yi, a com­mu­ni­ca­tions man­ager and one of the COTY judges, says: “Mo­tor­ing jour­nal­ists of the fu­ture will look back and see the Porsche Taycan as the car which started it all – the first per­for­mance electric car that could hold a can­dle to the best the gas-pow­ered world could of­fer then.</p>
    <p>“Just like the Porsche 959 of the 1990s, the electric Taycan is a tech­ni­cal and per­for­mance tour de force, and a high water­mark for other would-be per­for­mance electric ve­hi­cles for some time to come.”</p>
    <p>An­other judge, med­i­cal doc­tor Kong Yongyao, says the Taycan rep­re­sents hope for fu­ture driv­ing en­thu­si­asts.</p>
    <p>“It is proof that Porsche-ness can ex­ist even in a si­lent, ul­tra­smooth e-mo­bile,” Dr Kong says. “By ex­ten­sion, this gives us hope for Fer­rari­ness, Lambo-ness, M-ness and AMG-ness to sur­vive.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, hearts are also won by other con­tenders – picked from some 40 new mod­els launched by au­tho­rised agents this year.</p>
    <p>Ms Lynn Tan, a freelance writer, says the Hyundai Avante “im­presses with its quiet sen­si­bil­ity”. She adds: “It pos­sesses a cer­tain wow fac­tor, not to the ex­tent of sweep­ing you off your feet, but with a very well-thought-out and well-put-to­gether pack­age at a very at­trac­tive price point.</p>
    <p>“It’s a big leap from the pre­vi­ous Avante and it has def­i­nitely raised the bar in its seg­ment – two im­por­tant cri­te­ria in a COTY con­tender.”</p>
    <p>Lawyer Edric Pan says the Mini E is “a riot with its crazily in­stant ac­cel­er­a­tion and bril­liantly kart­like han­dling”.</p>
    <p>“It is a real gig­gle to drive,” he says, adding that the car “makes you for­give foibles such as its lim­ited range and slightly choppy ride”.</p>
    <p>Mr Lionel Seah, an­other freelance writer, says the BMW 118i stands out be­cause it is an en­gag­ing drive de­spite its mod­est driv­e­train. “Get be­hind the wheel and it’s rar­ing to go,” he says. “Pre­mium hatch­backs don’t get bet­ter than this.”</p>
