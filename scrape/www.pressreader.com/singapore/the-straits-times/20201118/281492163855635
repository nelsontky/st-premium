    <p>The fi­nal Hous­ing Board sales ex­er­cise of the year kicked off yes­ter­day, with over 5,700 Build-To-Or­der flats on of­fer across five towns.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est was so high that HDB’s web­site ex­pe­ri­enced heavy traf­fic in the evening, and some re­ported is­sues sub­mit­ting ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 5,795 Build-To-Or­der (BTO) flats spread across seven hous­ing projects in five es­tates were launched for sale by the Hous­ing Board yes­ter­day in the fi­nal sales ex­er­cise for the year.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est was so high that HDB’s web­site saw heavy traf­fic yes­ter­day evening. Some flat ap­pli­cants also faced is­sues when sub­mit­ting their ap­pli­ca­tions on­line.</p>
    <p>HDB re­minded the pub­lic that the sales ex­er­cise is on for a week un­til next Mon­day, and that suc­cess­ful ap­pli­cants will be de­ter­mined by a com­puter bal­lot, and not on a first come, first served ba­sis.</p>
    <p>The ex­er­cise’s big­gest pro­ject is the Bis­han Ridges, where 1,502 two-room flexi, three-room and four-room flats are on of­fer.</p>
    <p>The site in Bis­han Street 14 is next to the Kal­lang River and about 400m, or a five-minute walk, from Bis­han MRT sta­tion.</p>
    <p>Prices start from $374,000, with­out grants, for a three-room flat and $528,000 for a four-room flat.</p>
    <p>Prices are slightly higher than those of the 472 units in Bis­han</p>
    <p>Street 11 launched in the Au­gust BTO sales ex­er­cise, likely due to the pro­ject’s prox­im­ity to the MRT sta­tion. Prices for the Au­gust ex­er­cise were from $302,000, with­out grants, for a three-room flat and $484,000 for a four-room unit.</p>
    <p>The es­ti­mated com­ple­tion date is the sec­ond quar­ter of 2026. When The Straits Times first re­ported on the flats in Oc­to­ber last year, be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic hit, the flats were due to be ready by 2025.</p>
    <p>Be­sides Bis­han, the other flats are spread across the ma­ture towns of Toa Payoh (Bi­dadari) and Tampines, and the non-ma­ture towns of Sem­bawang and Ten­gah.</p>
    <p>In Toa Payoh (Bi­dadari), there are two BTO projects. The smaller one is ParkView @ Bi­dadari, where some 358 three-room and four­room flats are lo­cated next to the up­com­ing Alkaff Lake and within walk­ing dis­tance of Woodleigh MRT sta­tion.</p>
    <p>The other is Bart­ley Bea­con, with 880 three-room, four-room and five-room flats on a site next to Maris Stella High School and within walk­ing dis­tance of Bart­ley MRT sta­tion.</p>
    <p>In both lo­ca­tions, prices start from $324,000 for a three-room flat and $466,000 for a four-room one.</p>
    <p>Five-room units in Bart­ley Bea­con start from $627,000, mak­ing them the most ex­pen­sive flats in this launch.</p>
    <p>The es­ti­mated com­ple­tion dates for ParkView @ Bi­dadari and Bart­ley Bea­con are the first and sec­ond quar­ter of 2025 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>In Tampines, 750 two-room flexi, four-room and five-room units are on of­fer at Tampines GreenEmer­ald, on a site bounded by Be­dok Reser­voir Road and Tampines Street 96.</p>
    <p>Prices start from $334,000 for a four-room flat and $460,000 for a five-room one.</p>
    <p>There are two hous­ing projects in Ten­gah, both within the Gar­den dis­trict.</p>
    <p>There is Gar­den Court @ Ten­gah with 790 two-room flexi, three­room, four-room and five-room flats. Across from it is Gar­den Ter­race @ Ten­gah with 789 two-room flexi, three-room, four-room and five-room units.</p>
    <p>In both lo­ca­tions, prices start from $108,000 for a two-room flexi flat and $394,000 for a five­room one.</p>
    <p>Th­ese flats will be the ear­li­est to be ready in this launch – around the first quar­ter of 2024.</p>
    <p>In Sem­bawang, 726 two-room flexi, three-room, four-room and five-room units are on of­fer at Sun Sails. Prices start from $92,000 for a two-room flexi flat and $336,000 for a five-room one.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, another 5,220 flats are on of­fer in this year’s first Sale of Bal­ance Flats sales. The ex­er­cise, typ­i­cally held in May, was de­layed due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Th­ese flats are spread across ma­ture and non-ma­ture es­tates such as Marine Pa­rade, Queen­stown, Cle­menti, Pung­gol and Sengkang.</p>
    <p>This BTO sales ex­er­cise comes af­ter a com­bined sales ex­er­cise in Au­gust, where big­ger flats in Gey­lang and Ang Mo Kio were over­sub­scribed by 14 and 10 times re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>PropNex chief ex­ec­u­tive Is­mail Gafoor ex­pects the flats in Bis­han and Toa Payoh (Bi­dadari) to be the most hotly con­tested as they are lo­cated in the city fringe and are close to pop­u­lar schools.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it re­mains to be seen whether an up­com­ing funeral par­lour com­plex – slated to be com­pleted in 2025 – near the sites in Toa Payoh (Bi­dadari) might de­ter some prospec­tive home buyers from ap­ply­ing, he added.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, HDB has launched 16,752 BTO flats this year, along with another 1,298 flats for open book­ing that are avail­able all year round.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary next year, HDB will launch some 3,500 flats in Bukit Ba­tok, Ten­gah, Kal­lang/Wham­poa and Toa Payoh (Bi­dadari).</p>
    <p>Another 3,800 flats will be of­fered in Bukit Merah, Gey­lang, Ten­gah and Wood­lands next May.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, another 5,220 flats are on of­fer in this year’s first Sale of Bal­ance Flats sales. The ex­er­cise, typ­i­cally held in May, was de­layed due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Th­ese flats are spread across ma­ture and non-ma­ture es­tates such as Marine Pa­rade, Queen­stown, Cle­menti, Pung­gol and Sengkang.</p>
