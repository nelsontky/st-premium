    <p>TOKYO • As the coro­n­avirus resurges in Ja­pan, politi­cians and ex­perts are grow­ing more di­vided on the im­pact that a sub­sidy pro­gramme en­cour­ag­ing peo­ple to travel is hav­ing on the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The pop­u­lar “Go To Travel” cam­paign, which dis­counts trips to boost re­gions hit hard­est by a lack of tourists, is one of the gov­ern­ment’s most prized projects for spurring the econ­omy and has been backed heav­ily by Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga.</p>
    <p>But as the coun­try tack­les its largest surge in the virus yet, a de­bate has erupted over whether the pro­gramme is a main cause for the rise in in­fec­tions. The risk is that the cam­paign could be do­ing more long-term harm than good in a coun­try at­tempt­ing to bal­ance grow­ing the econ­omy and con­trol­ling the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Go To Travel cam­paign is just one of mul­ti­ple sub­si­dies pro­moted to kick-start the econ­omy, with Go To Eat and Go To Event pro­grammes of­fer­ing restau­rant and event dis­counts.</p>
    <p>Crit­i­cal com­men­tary and op­po­nents on so­cial me­dia have mocked the pro­grammes as “Go To Hospi­tal” or “Go To Heaven”.</p>
    <p>The cam­paign is also look­ing like it is cross­ing wires with lo­cal gov­ern­ments as they be­gin to im­ple­ment fresh re­stric­tions to stem the ris­ing num­ber of se­vere Covid-19 cases in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>Tokyo’s gov­er­nor is urg­ing res­i­dents to avoid un­nec­es­sary out­ings and the gov­ern­ment is rais­ing the spec­tre of an­other state of emer­gency.</p>
    <p>But na­tional lead­ers are re­luc­tant to scrap the stim­u­lus that has been hailed for in­ject­ing tril­lions of yen into the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>There have been only 197 in­fec­tions among the more than 40 mil­lion peo­ple who have taken part in the Go To pro­gramme, said Chief Cab­i­net Sec­re­tary Kat­sunobu Kato on Thurs­day. The gov­ern­ment has not re­ceived re­ports of ho­tel work­ers or oth­ers be­ing in­fected by trav­ellers, he added.</p>
    <p>At a par­lia­men­tary session on Wed­nes­day, Mr Suga said that “there is no ev­i­dence that the travel pro­gramme is the main cause” of the surge. He told the op­po­si­tion leader: “If you have a bet­ter idea, I’m open to hear­ing it.”</p>
    <p>Mr Suga helped launch the pro­gramme dur­ing the sum­mer surge amid great pub­lic con­cern.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view in Au­gust, he said one rea­son for the sub­si­dies is to keep ho­tels and inns afloat to reach the gov­ern­ment’s tar­get of at­tract­ing 60 mil­lion for­eign tourists by 2030.</p>
    <p>The im­pact of the sub­si­dies is sig­nif­i­cant. No­mura Re­search In­sti­tute econ­o­mist Takahide Ki­uchi said halt­ing the pro­gramme for a year would shave 0.39 per­cent­age point off the gross do­mes­tic prod­uct by elim­i­nat­ing some 2.17 tril­lion yen (S$27.9 bil­lion) in con­sumer spend­ing.</p>
    <p>“Mr Suga is pas­sion­ate about the pro­gramme and doesn’t want to cancel it,” Mr Ki­uchi said. “But if the gov­ern­ment wants to help the tourism sec­tor, it should give money to peo­ple in the sec­tor di­rectly.”</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has made some ef­forts to change the Go To pro­gramme amid ris­ing in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Last week­end, Mr Suga ex­cluded from the cam­paign ar­eas where the virus was spread­ing but only for in­bound trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>Dis­cus­sions are un­der way to ex­tend Go To un­til May next year.</p>
    <p>About 51 per cent of those sur­veyed in an Asahi poll dis­agreed with such an ex­ten­sion, while 37 per cent ap­prove. The poll, con­ducted ear­lier this month, showed that sup­port for the pro­gramme was higher in Tokyo but lower in re­gions such as Hokkaido.</p>
    <p>There is no ev­i­dence that the travel pro­gramme is the main cause. PRIME MIN­IS­TER YOSHI­HIDE SUGA</p>
