    <p>SYDNEY • Sev­eral ma­jor Aus­tralian busi­nesses urged a swift re­open­ing of state bor­ders yes­ter­day, even as the author­i­ties warned against com­pla­cency as new cases of the coro­n­avirus ap­pear to be trend­ing lower.</p>
    <p>Many in­ter­nal bor­ders in Aus­tralia have been closed to con­tain the spread of the virus – with Vic­to­ria and New South Wales ac­count­ing for al­most all new cases – and most states and ter­ri­to­ries have vowed to keep them shut for months to come.</p>
    <p>Qan­tas Air­ways said yes­ter­day the clo­sures were se­verely ham­per­ing a re­cov­ery in the do­mes­tic avi­a­tion mar­ket, which, along­side a lack of in­ter­na­tional fly­ing, would lead to a sig­nif­i­cant loss this fi­nan­cial year.</p>
    <p>The air­line was run­ning only 20 per cent of its usual do­mes­tic sched­ule this month due to states clos­ing bor­ders, which chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Alan Joyce said “doesn’t seem to make any med­i­cal sense”.</p>
    <p>Re­tail con­glom­er­ate Wes­farm­ers also called for a quick re­open­ing of state bor­ders, with CEO Rob Scott say­ing the re­stric­tions were caus­ing “enor­mous hard­ship”.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son, who has ex­pressed frus­tra­tion at the eco­nomic im­pact of the clo­sures, has writ­ten to state lead­ers about the prob­lem they have caused for farm­ers, said Fed­eral Health Min­is­ter Greg Hunt.</p>
    <p>The com­plaints came as Aus­tralia’s sec­ond-most pop­u­lous state of Vic­to­ria, the coun­try’s Covid-19 hot spot, re­ported a small in­crease in new daily in­fec­tions to 240 cases over the past 24 hours.</p>
    <p>The fig­ure, down from more than 700 late last month, will buoy op­ti­mism that a hard lock­down of state cap­i­tal Mel­bourne is con­tain­ing the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria’s deputy chief health of­fi­cer Allen Cheng told re­porters: “There are still 240 to­day. So those num­bers are still too high. But... they are com­ing down, they’re go­ing in the right di­rec­tion.”</p>
    <p>New South Wales recorded just five cases, al­though Premier Gla­dys Bere­jik­lian said there was still con­cern over the num­ber of un­known cases. “It’s im­por­tant that the com­mu­nity con­tin­ues to em­brace those Covid-safe be­hav­iours, such as so­cial dis­tanc­ing and wear­ing a mask,” she said.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has recorded just over 24,000 Covid-19 in­fec­tions, with 463 deaths.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, neigh­bour­ing New Zealand con­firmed five new cases yes­ter­day as part of a com­mu­nity out­break, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of ac­tive cases in the coun­try to 101.</p>
    <p>All the new cases are linked to pre­vi­ous cases i n the Auck­land fam­ily clus­ter, Health Di­rec­tor-Gen­eral Ash­ley Bloom­field told a daily brief­ing.</p>
    <p>There are no new cases in man­aged iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Of the five cases in the com­mu­nity, four are Auck­land-based. One case is cur­rently in Waikato Hos­pi­tal near Auck­land, Mr Bloom­field said.</p>
    <p>There are six peo­ple re­ceiv­ing hos­pi­tal-level care for Covid-19, all in sta­ble con­di­tion, he said.</p>
    <p>There are 133 peo­ple linked to the clus­ter who have been moved into the Auck­land quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes 65 peo­ple who have tested pos­i­tive and their house­hold con­tacts, ac­cord­ing to the min­istry.</p>
    <p>Of the 80 cases in the com­mu­nity out­break, 78 are linked to the Auck­land clus­ter and two cases re­main un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion, Mr Bloom­field said.</p>
    <p>As of last night, the to­tal num­ber of cases con­firmed in New Zealand stood at 1,654.</p>
    <p>Auck­land, which is New Zealand’s largest city, will re­main in Covid-19 Alert Level 3 till next Wed­nes­day be­fore fur­ther lock­down de­ci­sions are made, with the rest of the coun­try stay­ing in Alert Level 2 with re­laxed re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Un­der Level 3, busi­nesses are re­quired to im­ple­ment Covid-19 safety mea­sures, but most peo­ple are en­cour­aged to work from home and school chil­dren l earn from home.</p>
    <p>STAY VIG­I­LANT</p>
    <p>It’s im­por­tant that the com­mu­nity con­tin­ues to em­brace those Covid-safe be­hav­iours, such as so­cial dis­tanc­ing and wear­ing a mask. ’’</p>
