    <p>Sev­eral celebri­ties have waded into the dis­cus­sion sur­round­ing sex­ual ha­rass­ment al­le­ga­tions against Dee Kosh, as the As­so­ci­a­tion of Women for Ac­tion and Re­search (Aware) ex­pressed sup­port for those who have spo­ken up against the ra­dio dee­jay and so­cial me­dia per­son­al­ity.</p>
    <p>The 32-year-old, whose real name is Dar­ryl Ian Koshy, has been ac­cused of so­lic­it­ing nude pic­tures and of­fer­ing money to mi­nors in re­turn for sex­ual favours, among other things.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that six po­lice re­ports have been filed against him so far. In­ves­ti­ga­tions are on go­ing.</p>
    <p>Ac­cu­sa­tions of sex­ual ha­rass­ment sur­faced over the week­end against Dee Kosh, who has 380,000 fol­low­ers on his YouTube chan­nel and is known for food re­views on the Night Owl Cine­mat­ics YouTube chan­nel. Screen­shots of his chats with at least five al­leged vic­tims were posted on­line, lead­ing Dee Kosh to apol­o­gise on Mon­day for the “ques­tion­able” tone of one of his chats with a 15-year-old boy.</p>
    <p>The case has prompted dis­cus­sions about the sex­ual abuse of mi­nors – it is an of­fence to have sex with some­one below 16 years old, even if he or she con­sents.</p>
    <p>Aware as­serted yes­ter­day in a Face­book post that it is “cat­e­gor­i­cally wrong to en­gage a mi­nor in sex­ual con­ver­sa­tion”.</p>
    <p>“In fact, in any sit­u­a­tion that in­volves a clear power dif­fer­en­tial be­tween par­ties – due to an age gap, fame or pro­fes­sional po­si­tion – con­sent be­comes grey (at best). That should be ap­par­ent to any­one, par­tic­u­larly an adult, with a de­cent grasp of con­sent.”</p>
    <p>Aware also com­mended those who have spo­ken up. “It is not easy, as well, to call out a pow­er­ful public fig­ure and stand your ground in the face of gaslight­ing and threats of lit­i­ga­tion,” it posted.</p>
    <p>After the al­le­ga­tions sur­faced on­line last Satur­day, Dee Kosh en­gaged a lawyer to is­sue a cease-and-de­sist let­ter to an al­leged vic­tim, who was the first to pub­licly ac­cuse him. The al­leged vic­tim took down the posts.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral lo­cal celebri­ties have also com­mented on the case.</p>
    <p>Sib­lings Ben­jamin, 30, and Narelle Kheng, 26, from the band, The Sam Wil­lows, ex­pressed sol­i­dar­ity with the al­leged vic­tims on their In­sta­gram sto­ries on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Ben­jamin Kheng noted that it took an “in­cred­i­ble amount of courage” for sur­vivors of sex­ual of­fences to speak up. Ac­knowl­edg­ing that Dee Kosh is his friend, he added: “I pray that the truth will sur­face in full, and that he’ll un­der­stand the grav­ity of his ac­tions. I want him to do bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>Singer Nathan Hartono, 29, who has had Dee Kosh on his weekly Good Hang pod­cast twice be­fore, an­nounced on In­sta­gram yes­ter­day that he would be dis­cussing “ev­ery­thing that’s go­ing on with Dee Kosh” in a pod­cast to­day.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, Hartono posted an In­sta­gram story shar­ing Dee Kosh’s apol­ogy. In re­sponse to a com­ment that Hartono had “zero spine”, he wrote: “I choose to with­hold any opin­ion un­til I un­der­stand the full story.”</p>
    <p>Hartono added: “Should I per­son­ally feel like he is wrong, after find­ing out the whole truth, I will be there for him on the path to­wards heal­ing and im­prove­ment. Be­cause that’s what friends do for each other.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, co­me­dian and YouTube per­son­al­ity Hirzi Zulk­i­flie, 31, apol­o­gised yes­ter­day on Face­book for how he and Dee Kosh had mocked so­cial in­flu­encer Ni­cole Choo in two of their videos in 2018, after the then 19-year-old pub­lished a po­etry col­lec­tion ti­tled Nine­teen.</p>
    <p>The apol­ogy came after Ms El­iza Teoh of Bub­bly Books, which pub­lished Choo’s book, called them out on Face­book on Tues­day, for the “sex­ist na­ture of their com­ments” against Choo and the way “they in­cited ha­tred to­wards her”.</p>
    <p>Ms Teoh re­vealed that Choo went over­seas for a few months to stay with a friend “be­cause it came to a point where she was phys­i­cally afraid” of trolls.</p>
    <p>In his apol­ogy post, Hirzi ad­mit­ted that his ac­tions amounted to cy­ber bul­ly­ing and that Choo “did not just face the care­less brunt of our hurt­ful re­marks, but our fol­low­ers were en­abled by our ac­tions”.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted, three firms that Dee Kosh pre­vi­ously worked with, Huawei, Food­panda and Len­ovo, said their en­gage­ments with him had ended and there were no on­go­ing or fu­ture projects planned.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Power 98 FM, where he hosts week­day night shows, said he was on leave and that the sta­tion “does not tol­er­ate any form of ha­rass­ment”.</p>
