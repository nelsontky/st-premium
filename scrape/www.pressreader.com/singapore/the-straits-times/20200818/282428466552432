    <p>LIS­BON • Ei­ther Paris Saint-Ger­main or RB Leipzig will be first­time Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal­ists to­day, but there is an­other sub-plot that is just as in­trigu­ing.</p>
    <p>It will be a case of men­tor ver­sus pro­tege at the Es­ta­dio da Luz.</p>
    <p>PSG coach Thomas Tuchel gave Leipzig coun­ter­part Ju­lian Nagels­mann his first break at Augs­burg 12 years ago as a scout, be­fore the lat­ter even­tu­ally tran­si­tioned to man­ag­ing, an op­por­tu­nity the younger Ger­man re­mains thank­ful for.</p>
    <p>Nagels­mann, who never played a pro­fes­sional game with a knee in­jury prompt­ing his re­tire­ment as an Augs­burg youth team player at the age of 20, said: “They (PSG) are a top team with a top trainer.</p>
    <p>“I have of­ten played (as a coach) against him (Tuchel) but rarely won. That should change now. I would also be sat­is­fied with a bad game if we win. Of course, I was his player, but that was many years ago. I’m more into the day-to-day busi­ness now, just like him.”</p>
    <p>At his former club Hof­fen­heim, Nagels­mann lost twice and drew once against his former men­tor, who was in charge of Borus­sia Dort­mund from 2016-17, and won the Ger­man Cup in his fi­nal year.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a 12-month ab­sence, fol­low­ing his fir­ing from Dort­mund, Tuchel joined the French cham­pi­ons, lead­ing them to back-to-back Ligue 1 ti­tles, in­clud­ing a do­mes­tic tre­ble this sea­son.</p>
    <p>While the pair were never close, Nagels­mann is a fan of Tuchel’s work and is wary of their ex­pen­sively-as­sem­bled squad – only Manch­ester City have spent more.</p>
    <p>“Our re­la­tion­ship was too prag­matic for that, but I am grate­ful for him giv­ing me the idea to be­come a coach,” he added. “They (PSG) are a team full of stars.</p>
    <p>“An­gel di Maria is com­ing back (from a one-game ban), (Kylian) Mbappe will be fit enough to play from the be­gin­ning.</p>
    <p>“It’s clear we need an­other top per­for­mance to get into the fi­nal.”</p>
    <p>Their op­po­nents’ qual­ity, how­ever, does not mean the Ger­man Bun­desliga side will be sit­ting back.</p>
    <p>At 33, Nagels­mann is the youngest coach to lead a team this deep into the com­pe­ti­tion, yet their pro­gres­sion has not come about from a de­fen­sive mind­set.</p>
    <p>Re­veal­ing to Goal.com the tac­ti­cal acu­men that pun­dits be­lieve is rem­i­nis­cent of Liver­pool’s Jur­gen Klopp, he said: “It is im­por­tant to work col­lec­tively.</p>
    <p>“First and fore­most, we have to make sure that we pre­vent the balls from get­ting deep. They (PSG) have pre­cise tar­get ar­eas in which they want to play in front of the op­pos­ing de­fen­sive chain.</p>
    <p>“We have al­ready come up with an idea of how to close these spa­ces.</p>
    <p>The point is to per­ceive how much pres­sure the ball-car­rier has.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve that we can hurt the op­po­nent more if we our­selves have the ball a lot and want to cre­ate op­por­tu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>PSG will be the favourites, hav­ing spent over a bil­lion eu­ros since the Qatari takeover in 2011, and they are des­per­ate to win their maiden Euro­pean Cup and fi­nally prove their big-club cre­den­tials.</p>
    <p>At his vir­tual pre-match press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, Tuchel yes­ter­day con­firmed Mbappe was likely fit to start be­fore in­sist­ing his team were at this late stage on merit.</p>
    <p>“We live in the pre­sent mo­ment, we de­serve to be here, we have had an ex­tra­or­di­nary jour­ney and sea­son,” the 46-year-old added.</p>
    <p>“We are ready, we are hun­gry, but we do not think about the his­tor­i­cal side, be­cause we are in the semi-fi­nals and we are there to win.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, Leipzig skip­per Yus­suf Poulsen, who joined in the 2013-14 sea­son when the Red Bull-owned team were in the third di­vi­sion, in­tends to rip up that script.</p>
    <p>He said: “This is a story that you couldn’t have writ­ten bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>STRICTLY BUSI­NESS</p>
    <p>Our re­la­tion­ship was too prag­matic for that, but I am grate­ful for him giv­ing me the idea to be­come a coach. ’’</p>
    <p>JU­LIAN NAGELS­MANN, RB Leipzig coach, on never hav­ing a close friend­ship with PSG boss Thomas Tuchel.</p>
