    <p>WASH­ING­TON• Frus­tra­tion among Democrats over House elec­tion losses spilled over dur­ing a con­fer­ence as sev­eral mod­er­ates blamed party pro­gres­sives for pro­mot­ing an ul­tra-lib­eral agenda that turned off swing vot­ers.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Abi­gail Span­berger, who nar­rowly won re­elec­tion in a Repub­li­can-lean­ing Vir­ginia district, was one of sev­eral Democrats who voiced anger that the party lost races they should have won, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with Thurs­day’s pri­vate cau­cus call.</p>
    <p>She and oth­ers con­tended that is­sues pro­moted by the Demo­cratic left – such as calls to de­fund the po­lice – gave Repub­li­cans an open­ing to paint the en­tire party as so­cial­ists and rad­i­cals.</p>
    <p>At least seven in­cum­bent Democrats, six of them first elected in the 2018 Demo­cratic wave, lost their bids for re-elec­tion. And the party fell short of flip­ping seats in states such as Texas that had ap­peared to be prime tar­gets in this elec­tion.</p>
    <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told fel­low Democrats she dis­agreed with the as­sess­ment that the elec­tion weak­ened the party, ac­cord­ing to one per­son who lis­tened to the call. She also said that poli­cies which are pop­u­lar in her home town of San Fran­cisco might not work else­where in the coun­try, re­mind­ing Democrats that they needed to find a con­sen­sus for a win­ning mes­sage.</p>
    <p>She em­pha­sised that Democrats had re­tained con­trol of the House and that Mr Joe Bi­den is on a path to win­ning the pres­i­dency, ac­cord­ing to the per­son. The party also needs to be mind­ful of the mes­sage it sends to vot­ers ahead of the Jan­uary run-offs for the Se­nate in Ge­or­gia that could give Democrats con­trol of the Se­nate, she told them.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tives Marc Veasey of Texas and Vi­cente Gon­za­lez of Texas were de­scribed as join­ing Ms Span­berger in air­ing sim­i­lar griev­ances. They com­plained that pro­gres­sive mem­bers em­brac­ing so­cial­ism were en­dan­ger­ing the con­tin­ued Demo­cratic hold on the House ma­jor­ity, ac­cord­ing to an­other per­son fa­mil­iar with the call.</p>
    <p>The power of the party’s young and vo­cal pro­gres­sives, led by New York Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Alexan­dria Oca­sio-Cortez, is set to grow with the ad­di­tion next year of sev­eral new mem­bers who have re­placed more cen­trist vet­er­ans.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Rashida Tlaib of Michi­gan, an Oca­sio-Cortez ally who also was first elected in 2018, said she viewed the com­plaints from the cen­trists as pres­sure on her not to speak her mind, ac­cord­ing to one of the peo­ple.</p>
    <p>For his part, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump on Thurs­day hailed Repub­li­can vic­to­ries in House races against pre­dic­tions. The GOP “ac­tu­ally won many new seats, and I think many more on the way,” he said.</p>
    <p>There are still 34 seats left to be set­tled, ac­cord­ing to an As­so­ci­ated Press tally early yes­ter­day. Democrats cur­rently have 232 seats to 197 for Repub­li­cans and one Lib­er­tar­ian. Five seats are va­cant.</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic ten­sions will be build­ing lead­ing up to the 2022 elec­tions. The party in con­trol of the White House his­tor­i­cally has lost seats in midterms, and Democrats will have a nar­rower ma­jor­ity to de­fend head­ing into that vote.</p>
    <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told fel­low Democrats she dis­agreed with the as­sess­ment that the elec­tion weak­ened the party... She also said that poli­cies that are pop­u­lar in her home town of San Fran­cisco might not work else­where in the coun­try, re­mind­ing Democrats that they needed to find a con­sen­sus for a win­ning mes­sage.</p>
