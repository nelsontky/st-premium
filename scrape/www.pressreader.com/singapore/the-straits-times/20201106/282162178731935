    <p>Right: A demon­stra­tion on how to wear one of the pieces of cloth­ing de­signed by lo­cal start-up Will & Well for post-stroke pa­tients.</p>
    <p>A re­mote foetal mon­i­tor­ing pro­gramme that aims to de­tect foetal dis­tress in women with high-risk pregnancie­s is tar­get­ing an over­seas launch by the mid­dle of next year.</p>
    <p>It was tri­alled at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hospi­tal’s ob­stet­rics and gy­nae­col­ogy depart­ment, and could be de­ployed there for use if found to be cost-ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>This is one of the more than 20 med­i­cal tech­nol­ogy, or medtech, in­no­va­tions that are be­ing sup­ported by the Na­tional Univer­sity Health Sys­tem’s Cen­tre for In­no­va­tion in Health­care (NUHS CIH) in their jour­ney to mar­ket.</p>
    <p>They have at­tracted more than $100 mil­lion in in­vest­ment from 30 in­vestors so far.</p>
    <p>And last week, the cen­tre signed an agree­ment with Asia Re­search & In­no­va­tion Al­liance to set up a $50 mil­lion ven­ture cap­i­tal fund to help lo­cal medtech start-ups en­ter the Asia-Pa­cific mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The man be­hind the two-yearold cen­tre is Pro­fes­sor Lawrence Ho who, as di­rec­tor of NUHS CIH, is ea­ger to help the start-ups cre­ate value for their prod­ucts and then con­nect them with in­vestors so that the tech­nolo­gies will even­tu­ally reach the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“There are all these in­no­va­tions and there’s no point if noth­ing comes out of it,” he said last week, on the side­lines of a show­case at CIH at Alexan­dra Hospi­tal (AH).</p>
    <p>“We do what we are best at, which is in clin­i­cal tri­als and val­i­da­tion...”</p>
    <p>This is a key com­po­nent of the process of bring­ing a medtech prod­uct to mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“Health­care is about pa­tient safety and ef­fec­tive­ness. It’s very tough to do... Adop­tion is very dif­fi­cult. If I ask you to adopt some­thing, you won’t. You’ve got to be con­vinced (of the value),” he said.</p>
    <p>The foetal mon­i­tor prod­uct, which can ac­cu­rately de­tect foetal heart rate, uter­ine con­trac­tions and ma­ter­nal heart rate, is now in the proof-of-value stage, where its cost-ef­fec­tive­ness is be­ing stud­ied, be­fore it can go to mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Mr Am­r­ish Nair, the 34-year-old chief ex­ec­u­tive and co-founder of Bior­ithm, the firm be­hind it, in­tends to mar­ket the prod­uct on a sub­scrip­tion model.</p>
    <p>“Pre­vi­ously, such mon­i­tor­ing was only done at the hos­pi­tals. With this, now, it can be done at home,” he said.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal start-up Will & Well, which has a range of ap­parel tar­geted at post-stroke pa­tients and those with dis­abil­i­ties, is also be­ing helped by NUHS CIH.</p>
    <p>These gar­ments make use of mag­nets that snap into place, and can have front slits de­signed to assist care­givers, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>The ap­parel will re­tail at the AH phar­macy from some time in the first quar­ter of next year. And its gar­ments re­designed as pa­tient scrubs will be tri­alled at AH on pa­tients un­der­go­ing spe­cialised re­hab in the ward next year.</p>
    <p>Other in­no­va­tions that were high­lighted last week in­clude a vir­tual re­al­ity trauma-train­ing sim­u­la­tion for emer­gency room doc­tors from Sin­ga­pore-Nor­way firm Vis­ual Engi­neer­ing and a sur­gi­cally im­planted tag for real-time mon­i­tor­ing of post-sur­gi­cal com­pli­ca­tions, or Wise su­tures, by Dr Viveka Kal­i­dasan.</p>
    <p>There was also a made-in-Ja­pan au­ton­o­mous wheel­chair that can re­duce the por­ter­ing needs at hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>Prof Ho said he re­ceives pitches from in­no­va­tors al­most ev­ery week.</p>
    <p>“I would ask them the dif­fi­cult ques­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>These in­clude what they want to do with their prod­uct in five years’ time, he said.</p>
    <p>They have to demon­strate that they are in it for the long haul as the medtech jour­ney, while re­ward­ing, can be long and te­dious.</p>
    <p>EYE­ING THE MAR­KET</p>
    <p>There are all these in­no­va­tions and there’s no point if noth­ing comes out of it... We do what we are best at, which is in clin­i­cal tri­als and val­i­da­tion...</p>
    <p>PRO­FES­SOR LAWRENCE HO, di­rec­tor of Na­tional Univer­sity Health Sys­tem’s Cen­tre for In­no­va­tion in Health­care.</p>
