    <p>YOKO­HAMA A six-storey-high ro­bot – mod­elled af­ter a char­ac­ter in clas­sic anime se­ries Mo­bile Suit Gun­dam – made its first killer moves this week to win the hearts of fans of the Gun­dam fran­chise.</p>
    <p>Stand­ing tall at 18m and weigh­ing 24 tonnes, the gi­ant ro­bot could be seen in an on­line video posted on Mon­day tak­ing two steps for­ward, be­fore get­ting down on one knee, stand­ing back up and ges­tic­u­lat­ing.</p>
    <p>This was a test of the ro­bot, which was built with more than 200 parts made from a mix­ture of steel and car­bon fi­bre-re­in­forced plas­tic, in Yoko­hama, a Ja­panese city south of Tokyo, CNN re­ported.</p>
    <p>Six years in the mak­ing, the life­size hu­manoid was cre­ated as a cen­tre­piece for Gun­dam Fac­tory Yoko­hama at Ya­mashita Pier, and was to de­but when the tourist at­trac­tion was set to open next month.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors would have been able to view the tow­er­ing ro­bot up close and learn about the de­sign and tech­nol­ogy be­hind its slick moves.</p>
    <p>But the open­ing has been de­layed.</p>
    <p>“This de­ci­sion was made to en­sure the health and safety of our fans and em­ploy­ees in re­sponse to the world­wide spread of Covid-19,” the com­pany that op­er­ates the site was quoted by CNN as say­ing.</p>
    <p>A no­tice on the web­site of Gun­dam Fac­tory Yoko­hama says the grand open­ing will still take place this year but the de­tails are not yet avail­able.</p>
    <p>The anime about space ro­bots, cre­ated and di­rected by Yoshiyuki Tomino, was first in­tro­duced in 1979 for a tele­vi­sion au­di­ence but the ini­tial run was cut short due to dis­mal rat­ings.</p>
    <p>But the ro­bots be­came a phe­nom­e­nal hit and must-have toys for boys when Ja­panese toy­maker Bandai bought the copy­rights to build plas­tic mod­els of the show’s gi­ant ma­chines, and Gun­dam be­gan to take off with se­quels, manga, movies and other spin-offs.</p>

But with the Covid-19 pan&#xAD;demic de&#xAD;lay&#xAD;ing the tourist at&#xAD;trac&#xAD;tion&#x2019;s open&#xAD;ing, fans will have to wait to view the ro&#xAD;bot up close.</p>
