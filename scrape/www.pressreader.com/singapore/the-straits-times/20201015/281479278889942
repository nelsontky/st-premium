    <p>It is no sur­prise that MediShield</p>
    <p>Life pre­mi­ums are poised to rise next year, since only a five-year mora­to­rium was promised when the scheme was launched in Novem­ber 2015.</p>
    <p>Two pro­pos­als have ruf­fled feath­ers. One was the more than one-third jump in pre­mi­ums for peo­ple aged 61 years and older. The other was the re­duc­tion of cov­er­age for pri­vate hospi­tal bills from 35 per cent to 25 per cent.</p>
    <p>The other pro­posed changes to the com­pul­sory na­tional health­care in­sur­ance in­volve bet­ter cov­er­age – such as higher an­nual claims as well as claims for daily ward charges – so no one is up­set about them.</p>
    <p>In fact, those changes are ap­pre­ci­ated, as they strengthen MediShield Life as a scheme that cov­ers 90 per cent of big sub­sidised bills. This is very im­por­tant, es­pe­cially for the 27 per cent of peo­ple here who have only the ba­sic scheme to pro­tect them.</p>
    <p>Un­der the pro­posed changes, pre­mi­ums are set to in­crease by</p>
    <p>11.5 per cent for those aged 20 or younger, and by 34 per cent to</p>
    <p>35.4 per cent for peo­ple aged 61 years and older.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, only those aged 75 years and older pay more than $1,000 a year in pre­mi­ums. With the changes, all who are 60 years and older will be pay­ing four-digit pre­mi­ums.</p>
    <p>At the top end, pre­mi­ums will go up from $1,530 to $2,055 for se­niors 90 years and older – a group un­likely to be still work­ing and con­tribut­ing to their Medis­ave ac­counts. There are more than 20,000 peo­ple in that age group.</p>
    <p>While no one likes to pay higher pre­mi­ums, it is un­der­stood that they are nec­es­sary, not just for the bet­ter cov­er­age the MediShield</p>
    <p>Life Coun­cil is sug­gest­ing, but also to keep up with health­care in­fla­tion, which is about 4 per cent a year.</p>
    <p>RIS­ING HEALTH­CARE COSTS</p>
    <p>Health­care in­fla­tion has sev­eral causes. One is labour cost. Just as all of us ex­pect our pay to in­crease with greater ex­pe­ri­ence, so too do health­care work­ers. We can’t deny them this, just be­cause they are in a more hu­man­i­tar­ian field.</p>
    <p>Salaries are but one con­tribut­ing fac­tor. The bulk of the cost in­crease comes from bet­ter treat­ments and pro­ce­dures.</p>
    <p>Pre­mium in­creases will be lower only if we are will­ing to set­tle for out­dated treat­ments. But why would peo­ple set­tle for less than the gold stan­dard?</p>
    <p>It’s thanks to bet­ter health­care that sur­vival rates have im­proved. But with cer­tain con­di­tions such as can­cer, sur­vivors may re­quire on­go­ing care to pre­vent re­cur­rence – and this will add to the to­tal health­care bill.</p>
    <p>An­other rea­son for ris­ing health­care cost is the age­ing pop­u­la­tion. Older peo­ple are more likely to have more se­ri­ous ail­ments. More se­niors end up in hospi­tal and of­ten take longer to re­cover, and thus end up with big­ger bills.</p>
    <p>But this last ar­gu­ment should not have an im­pact on MediShield Life pre­mium in­creases, as the in­sur­ance is based on each age co­hort pay­ing for it­self, with no cross-gen­er­a­tional sub­sidy.</p>
    <p>Older peo­ple have al­ready been pay­ing higher pre­mi­ums from the day the scheme was launched, to re­flect this.</p>
    <p>HIGH PRE­MIUM IN­CREASES</p>
    <p>Bet­ter ben­e­fits and ris­ing health­care costs jus­tify pre­mium in­creases, but the ques­tion re­mains: why by so much?</p>
    <p>MediShield Life will be re­viewed ev­ery three years. So how much more will pre­mi­ums go up by three years from now, and sub­se­quently at each re­view?</p>
    <p>The orig­i­nal pre­mi­ums took into ac­count that they would not rise for five years. If the ac­tu­ar­ies have done their sums ac­cu­rately, then the cur­rent in­crease is to take care of the ex­pected call on the in­sur­ance till the next re­view in three years’ time.</p>
    <p>If this is the rate of pre­mium in­crease we can ex­pect at the next two re­views, older peo­ple must be pre­pared for pre­mi­ums to more than dou­ble in a decade.</p>
    <p>That is an un­nerv­ing prospect. To be fair to the Gov­ern­ment, it has put in place sub­si­dies for half the pop­u­la­tion and Medis­ave top-ups for se­niors.</p>
    <p>MediShield Life pre­mi­ums are also struc­tured so that younger peo­ple pay higher pre­mi­ums, but will get re­bates when they are older. Cur­rent re­bates range from $12 to $537 a year, but may be ad­justed in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>All that is well and good. Nev­er­the­less, the ques­tion re­mains: Where does the need for 35 per cent higher pre­mi­ums come from?</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has given the as­sur­ance that the steep hike is not due to the high cost of fight­ing Covid-19, since the data used for the cal­cu­la­tions was up till last year, or pre-pan­demic.</p>
    <p>MediShield Life is pegged at sub­sidised treat­ments at public hos­pi­tals. Are the bills grow­ing so quickly be­cause the sub­sidy from the Gov­ern­ment is not enough?</p>
    <p>Last year, it was re­vealed that MediShield Life cov­er­age had dropped from 90 per cent of qual­i­fy­ing sub­sidised bills to just 80 per cent. This was sub­se­quently cor­rected.</p>
    <p>Are the higher pre­mi­ums to pay for that?</p>
    <p>One must also get to the root of what ac­counts for the short­fall.</p>
    <p>Is it due to some mis­cal­cu­la­tion on the bills that pa­tients – es­pe­cially the older ones – would tot up when the scheme started? Have there been run­away bill in­creases at public hos­pi­tals for sub­sidised pa­tients?</p>
    <p>Have sub­si­dies by the Gov­ern­ment been in­suf­fi­cient to cover 65 per cent to 80 per cent of hospi­tal stays in C-class wards for Sin­ga­pore­ans, and 50 per cent to 65 per cent in B2-class wards, re­sult­ing in pa­tients be­ing faced with big­ger bills that in­sur­ance needs to cover?</p>
    <p>If it is ei­ther the sec­ond or third rea­son, then the Min­istry of Health (MOH) needs to look into the mat­ter and, more im­por­tantly, rec­tify it.</p>
    <p>Al­ter­na­tively, the min­istry may want to look at rais­ing the pre­mium sub­sidy rate it is giv­ing to means-tested mid­dle-income and lower-income cit­i­zens, or in­crease their Medis­ave top-ups, to re­duce the bur­den of the higher pre­mi­ums.</p>
    <p>Yes, the Gov­ern­ment will be pro­vid­ing Covid-19 sub­si­dies for the first two years, but a more per­ma­nent sub­sidy is needed for the less well off, as the higher pre­mi­ums will be­come a fix­ture – on which fu­ture pre­mium hikes will be based.</p>
    <p>Of course this means that peo­ple who do not qual­ify for the sub­sidy or top-ups will have to fork out the higher pre­mi­ums. But as they are bet­ter off, and the dol­lar value of the pre­mium in­crease ranges from $15 to $525 a year, it should hope­fully be af­ford­able for them.</p>
    <p>CUT­TING PRI­VATE HOSPI­TAL CLAIMS</p>
    <p>The MediShield Life Coun­cil has sug­gested that the pro-ra­tion pay­ment for pri­vate hospi­tal bills be re­duced from 35 per cent to 25 per cent. It will con­tinue to pay 35 per cent of the bills for pri­vate B2-class and A-class wards at public hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>This is un­likely to de­ter pa­tients from seek­ing treat­ment at pri­vate hos­pi­tals, de­spite some doc­tors in the pri­vate sec­tor ex­press­ing such fears. Those who do go to pri­vate hos­pi­tals are al­most cer­tain to be the 73 per cent with pri­vate in­te­grated plans, or IPs.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed changes to MediShield Life will have no im­me­di­ate im­pact on them, as their bills are paid by whichever of the seven pri­vate in­sur­ance com­pa­nies they bought their IPs from.</p>
    <p>How­ever, that pro-ra­tion pay­ment change – which re­duces by al­most 30 per cent the amount in­sur­ers will re­ceive in claims from MediShield Life – would cer­tainly im­pact the in­sur­ers, and will most likely lead to higher pre­mi­ums for pri­vate hospi­tal IPs.</p>
    <p>About 1.75 mil­lion res­i­dents here held pri­vate hospi­tal IPs as at last year. They ac­count for 60 per cent of all IPs, the rest be­ing for pri­vate A-class and B1-class ward care at public hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>The ra­tio­nale for re­duc­ing the pro-ra­tion amount stems from rapidly es­ca­lat­ing pri­vate hospi­tal bills that have made their claims on MediShield Life dis­pro­por­tion­ately large.</p>
    <p>Since MediShield Life was de­signed to cover sub­sidised care, the pay­outs should re­flect sub­sidised bills. In 2015, that meant 35 per cent of pri­vate bills were roughly equal to B2-class bills. B2 is al­ready the more ex­pen­sive of the two sub­sidised ward classes.</p>
    <p>Now, how­ever, 35 per cent of pri­vate hospi­tal bills far ex­ceed sub­sidised bills for the same treat­ment, re­sult­ing in public hospi­tal pa­tients un­der­writ­ing much of the pri­vate hospi­tal pa­tient bills.</p>
    <p>Let’s take a quick look at a sim­ple pro­ce­dure – day surgery for a cataract in one eye. The me­dian rate in a pri­vate hospi­tal is $7,270. Pay­ing 35 per cent of the pri­vate hospi­tal bill comes to $2,545.</p>
    <p>Com­pare this to the me­dian sub­sidised bill of $1,342 at a public hospi­tal. Even when pay­ing just 25 per cent, the amount MediShield Life has to come up with for the pri­vate hospi­tal bill, at $1,818, is still much higher than the sub­sidised bill.</p>
    <p>It could even be ar­gued that the pro-ra­tion amount should be re­duced fur­ther for it to be eq­ui­table for sub­sidised pa­tients.</p>
    <p>An MOH spokesman said that over the past four years, “the num­ber of pri­vate hospi­tal claims re­ceiv­ing a pay­out has in­creased about 20 per cent faster than the over­all growth”.</p>
    <p>Last year, MediShield Life paid out $95 mil­lion for 60,000 pri­vate hospi­tal bills. A back-of-en­ve­lope cal­cu­la­tion shows that if the pro-ra­tion had been 25 per cent in­stead of 35 per cent, it would have paid about $27 mil­lion less last year.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the drop in pro-ra­tion will help, but won’t stem the climb­ing claims – which rose by $109 mil­lion last year. MediShield Life paid out $1,038 mil­lion for 684,000 bills last year, up from $929 mil­lion the pre­vi­ous year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, sav­ings for MediShield Life mean that pri­vate in­sur­ers will have to fork out more. So it would be sur­pris­ing if IP pre­mi­ums are not raised.</p>
    <p>For the old­est age group, pri­vate hospi­tal IP pre­mi­ums now range from $5,842 to $12,167 a year.</p>
    <p>The high pri­vate hospi­tal bills are al­ready caus­ing a lot of angst among the IP in­sur­ers, most of whom are com­plain­ing of un­der­writ­ing losses. Per­haps this is the big­ger prob­lem Sin­ga­pore needs to solve if it wants to keep health­care costs af­ford­able.</p>
