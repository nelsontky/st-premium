    <p>Ar­chi­tect Cliff Tan may have lived in Lon­don for close to 10 years, but he still misses the tastes from home.</p>
    <p>Since 2010, the 32-year-old has recre­ated, with Bri­tish sta­ples, nu­mer­ous clas­sic Sin­ga­porean foods such as peanut but­ter min jiang kueh (old-school Chi­nese pan­cakes), curry puffs and In­dian ro­jak to cel­e­brate Na­tional Day.</p>
    <p>This year, his cre­ative juices will pro­duce a re­minder of pork floss bun: brioche buns gen­er­ously spread with may­on­naise and topped with canned tuna flakes which had been dried and sea­soned with sugar and soya sauce.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan’s most suc­cess­ful cre­ation was min jiang kueh – repli­cated us­ing toasted crum­pets spread with crunchy peanut but­ter.</p>
    <p>“I got the idea when I moved to Lon­don in 2010. I was very home­sick and found this strange cake at the su­per­mar­ket called a crum­pet.</p>
    <p>“I put some peanut but­ter on it, and was amazed how sim­i­lar it tasted to min jiang kueh! That got me in­spired, and I tried other things, like stick­ing a hot dog into a brioche bun, which tasted ex­actly like those you get from the lo­cal neigh­bour­hood bak­eries,” he told The Straits Times in a phone in­ter­view on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan, who cel­e­brates Na­tional Day with his Hun­gar­ian part­ner Bela Soltesz and oc­ca­sion­ally friends from such places as Peru and Ire­land, said: “Recre­at­ing Sin­ga­porean sta­ples is a chal­lenge, but it shows you don’t need to be in Lon­don’s Chi­na­town to en­joy home food.”</p>
    <p>Other fam­i­lies liv­ing abroad recre­ate their sense of home by throw­ing Na­tional Day-themed par­ties and watch­ing the pa­rade on­line with their loved ones and friends.</p>
    <p>For Mrs Priscilla Ho, 40, re­turn­ing home to watch the Na­tional Day Pa­rade live at The Float three years ago was a mem­o­rable ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily of four re­turns home yearly to bask in the spirit and fes­tiv­i­ties lead­ing up to Sin­ga­pore’s birth­day bash.</p>
    <p>“Our favourite pa­rade high­lights are al­ways the parachutis­ts, fol­lowed by the spon­ta­neous and ex­hil­a­rat­ing Kal­lang Wave... and, of course, the fire­works,” said the house­wife.</p>
    <p>The ex­trav­a­ganza never fails to in­trigue her two chil­dren: Nathanael, 10, and Emma, eight. They have grown up abroad since the fam­ily moved ini­tially to Shang­hai seven years ago and in Jan­uary this year, to Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>This year, how­ever, it will be a qui­eter af­fair spent away ow­ing to Covid-19 travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily will in­stead host a small din­ner party with friends, over lo­cal de­lights such as chilli crab and frog porridge, com­plete with a live tele­cast of the Na­tional Day evening show at the Star Vista.</p>
    <p>“Since we aren’t back in Sin­ga­pore to re­ceive the yearly fun­pack, I’ve put to­gether my own for the kids, which is chock full of nos­tal­gic games like magic sparklers, Pop Pop snap­pers and bub­bles,” Mrs Ho added.</p>
    <p>The For­eign Af­fairs Min­istry said Sin­ga­pore’s over­seas mis­sions will con­tinue to or­gan­ise Na­tional Day cel­e­bra­tions this year.</p>
    <p>But “in view of Covid-19 and to en­sure the safety of our guests, such events may be car­ried out vir­tu­ally and in ac­cor­dance with the pre­vail­ing lo­cal pub­lic health­care mea­sures”, i t added.</p>
    <p>Mean­while in Shang­hai, Mrs Stella Ng, 39, a trade­mar­ket­ing man­ager, will at­tend a Na­tional Day din­ner on Sun­day with her fam­ily at Sin­ga­porean-brand Jumbo seafood res­tau­rant where the Na­tional Day Pa­rade will be tele­cast.</p>
    <p>Its or­gan­iser, the Sin­ga­pore Cham­ber of Com­merce in Shang­hai, ex­pects about 200 peo­ple to turn up.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing lived in China for 14 years, we make it a point to at­tend Na­tional Day gath­er­ings yearly, as it is an im­por­tant op­por­tu­nity to fos­ter na­tional iden­tity in our kids.”</p>
    <p>She hopes that watch­ing the pa­rade will also pique the in­ter­est of her 10-year-old son Dy­lan, “so that there is some sense of be­long­ing when it is his turn to do na­tional ser­vice”.</p>
