    <p>Lo­cal ra­dio DJ Daniel Ong Ming Yu and for­mer model Jaime Teo Chailin were hauled to court yes­ter­day over of­fences un­der the Em­ploy­ment of For­eign Man­power Act linked to pas­try chain Twelve Cup­cakes, which they founded.</p>
    <p>They al­legedly al­lowed the chain to un­der­pay the wages of their for­eign em­ploy­ees be­tween 2013 and 2016.</p>
    <p>There were also in­stances in­volv­ing some work­ers who, for pe­ri­ods be­tween 2012 and 2013, did not re­ceive any in­come.</p>
    <p>The court heard that the staff pur­port­edly did not re­ceive their stip­u­lated wages within a week of the end of the salary pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>One em­ployee – Mr Zhu Wei­hong – did not re­ceive his monthly salary of $2,000 within a week of the last day of the month. This hap­pened be­tween Sept 8 and Nov 8, 2012.</p>
    <p>Ong, 45, and Teo, 43, for­merly a mar­ried cou­ple, are each fac­ing 24 charges in­volv­ing eight em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Teo in­tends to plead guilty to her charges on Jan 26. Ong’s case has been ad­journed to the same day.</p>
    <p>For each charge un­der the Act, an of­fender can be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $10,000.</p>
    <p>Twelve Cup­cakes was founded by Ong and Teo in 2011. It was ac­quired for $2.5 mil­lion by Kolkatabas­ed Dhun­seri Group in 2016.</p>
    <p>The chain, un­der the new own­ers, pleaded guilty ear­lier this month to 15 charges of un­der­pay­ing its em­ploy­ees in 2017 and 2018.</p>
    <p>Four­teen other sim­i­lar charges will be taken into con­sid­er­a­tion by Dis­trict Judge Adam Nakhoda dur­ing sen­tenc­ing, which is ex­pected to take place on Jan 7.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Twelve Cup­cakes, un­der the new own­ers, un­der­paid six em­ploy­ees – who were in cus­tomer service and sales roles – their De­cem­ber 2016 to Septem­ber 2018 wages. One of them was also un­der­paid the Oc­to­ber and Novem­ber 2018 wages.</p>
    <p>The pas­try chain also paid less than the fixed monthly salary for Jan­uary 2017 to Septem­ber 2018 due to a sev­enth em­ployee, a pas­try chef.</p>
    <p>While the fixed monthly salaries of those in cus­tomer service and sales roles were stated as rang­ing from $2,200 to $2,600, they were paid only about $1,400 to $2,050 by the com­pany.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments state that Twelve Cup­cakes had ini­tially cred­ited the re­duced salaries to the em­ploy­ees’ bank ac­counts.</p>
    <p>From May 2018, how­ever, the firm paid the full salaries but then told the em­ploy­ees that they had to re­turn a por­tion to the com­pany in cash.</p>
    <p>It did this to con­ceal a pa­per trail of its of­fences, said Min­istry of Man­power pros­e­cu­tor Max­i­m­il­ian Chew in urg­ing the court to im­pose a fine of $127,000.</p>
