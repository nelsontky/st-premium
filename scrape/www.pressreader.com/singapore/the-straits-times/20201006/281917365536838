    <p>LONDON • Su­per­mar­kets, restau­rant chains and food man­u­fac­tur­ers un­der pres­sure from cam­paign­ers over their en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact have urged Bri­tain to strengthen a plan to stop trop­i­cal forests from be­ing cut down to grow co­coa, oil palm and soya bean.</p>
    <p>With the food in­dus­try un­der grow­ing scru­tiny over its role in driv­ing de­for­esta­tion in coun­tries such as Brazil and In­done­sia, Bri­tain is draw­ing up leg­is­la­tion to force the sec­tor to tighten over­sight of its sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>In an open let­ter yes­ter­day, some 20 large com­pa­nies wel­comed the plans as a “step for­ward” but said “it’s not cur­rently en­vi­sioned to be enough to halt de­for­esta­tion and we en­cour­age the gov­ern­ment to go fur­ther to... ad­dress this is­sue”.</p>
    <p>Sig­na­to­ries in­cluded su­per­mar­kets Tesco, Marks & Spencer, Mor­ri­son’s and Sains­bury’s, food man­u­fac­tur­ers Unilever, Nes­tle and Green­core Group, McDon­ald’s and var­i­ous live­stock pro­duc­ers.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s move to in­tro­duce le­gal penalties for com­pa­nies found to be com­plicit in de­for­esta­tion aims to im­prove upon a range of vol­un­tary, in­dus­try-led ini­tia­tives that have faced wide­spread crit­i­cism from en­vi­ron­men­tal groups.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies say they would pre­fer clear di­rec­tion from gov­ern­ments that would cre­ate stan­dard rules rather than nav­i­gat­ing the ex­ist­ing maze of vol­un­tary ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>Un­der the pro­posed leg­is­la­tion, large com­pa­nies would have to report on how they source trop­i­cal com­modi­ties.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies would also be banned from us­ing prod­ucts that are har­vested il­le­gally in their coun­try of ori­gin.</p>
    <p>But the su­per­mar­kets and food com­pa­nies which signed the let­ter say the pro­posed new law has a ma­jor loop­hole: farm­ers in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries can of­ten clear forests to grow cash crops for ex­port with­out break­ing any laws.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies want the new Bri­tish rules to ap­ply to all de­for­esta­tion – not just in cases where the de­struc­tion is il­le­gal.</p>
    <p>“The pro­posed leg­is­la­tion would con­tinue to al­low ram­pant de­for­esta­tion in hot spots such as In­done­sia and Brazil,” said Mr Robin Wil­loughby, UK di­rec­tor of cam­paign group Mighty Earth.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies are also con­cerned that the leg­is­la­tion would not ap­ply to smaller firms which may im­port con­sid­er­able amounts of prod­ucts, such as rub­ber, from sen­si­tive for­est re­gions.</p>
    <p>Mr Cyril Kor­mos, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of Wild Her­itage, a non-profit based in Berke­ley, Cal­i­for­nia, said a more com­pre­hen­sive over­haul of for­est man­age­ment rules glob­ally would be needed to re­verse the loss of old-growth forests, whose stores of car­bon form bas­tions to slow cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>“De­for­esta­tion pledges only go so far,” Mr Kor­mos said. “We need an equiv­a­lent fo­cus on end­ing degra­da­tion of pri­mary forests.”</p>
