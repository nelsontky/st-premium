    <p>Dig­i­tal plat­forms, like lo­cal mass me­dia web­sites, surged in im­por­tance dur­ing this year’s gen­eral elec­tion that many have dubbed an “In­ter­net elec­tion”, ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey com­mis­sioned by the In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies (IPS).</p>
    <p>Vot­ers turned to the web­sites of Sin­ga­pore mass me­dia such as The Straits Times, Lianhe Zaobao and CNA the most for in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, over­all trust in the Sin­ga­pore mass me­dia rose com­pared with dur­ing GE2015.</p>
    <p>At the same time, there was a de­cline in the pro­por­tion of vot­ers who tapped me­dia plat­forms, such as tele­vi­sion, print news­pa­pers and ra­dio, for in­for­ma­tion at least once a day com­pared with dur­ing GE2015, said IPS senior re­search fel­low Carol Soon, who pre­sented the sur­vey find­ings at an on­line fo­rum yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>De­bunk­ing the myth of a dig­i­tal di­vide among gen­er­a­tions, the baby boomers – those aged 56 and older in the sur­vey – used in­stant mes­sag­ing plat­forms the most to learn more about po­lit­i­cal par­ties and can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>But peo­ple’s pri­mary rea­sons for vot­ing, rather than In­ter­net use, were the strong­est pre­dic­tor of how they voted, said Dr Soon.</p>
    <p>Rea­sons such as “I al­ways voted for the same party” and “party’s track record” mat­tered more to those who voted for the PAP.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing al­ter­na­tive views in Par­lia­ment” and “dis­like for one party” mat­tered more to those who voted for op­po­si­tion par­ties.</p>
    <p>The two camps also di­verged in their on­line en­gage­ment.</p>
    <p>Those who voted for the PAP vis­ited on­line web­sites of Sin­ga­pore mass me­dia, while those who voted for the op­po­si­tion en­gaged with the po­lit­i­cal par­ties and can­di­dates via their so­cial me­dia plat­forms, such as Face­book and In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>So­cial net­work­ing sites, such as Face­book, and in­stant mes­sag­ing plat­forms, such as What­sApp, were the two most pop­u­lar modes of po­lit­i­cal en­gage­ment among the 2,018 vot­ers sur­veyed.</p>
    <p>The fo­rum was or­gan­ised by the IPS, which a week ago pre­sented the find­ings of its sur­vey on the GE2020 re­sults at a sim­i­lar fo­rum.</p>
    <p>The think-tank had con­ducted sim­i­lar polls af­ter the 2011 and 2015 gen­eral elec­tions.</p>
    <p>In GE2020, the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party’s (PAP) vote share shrank by al­most nine per­cent­age points to 61.24 per cent com­pared with dur­ing the 2015 elec­tion, while the Work­ers’ Party won Sengkang GRC – its sec­ond group rep­re­sen­ta­tion con­stituency.</p>
    <p>GREATER TRUST IN LO­CAL MASS ME­DIA</p>
    <p>While trust in lo­cal mass me­dia rose from 3 to 3.18 (on a scale of 1 to 5), younger vot­ers had sig­nif­i­cantly lower lev­els of such trust com­pared with the sand­wiched gen­er­a­tion (36 to 55 years old) and baby boomers. They were also more likely to turn to so­cial me­dia to ex­press their opin­ions when they did not trust what was re­ported in mass me­dia.</p>
    <p>The in­crease in trust was greater for older re­spon­dents.</p>
    <p>They also had the most po­lit­i­cal knowl­edge, based on the cor­rect an­swers they scored in a list of ques­tions posed by the sur­vey.</p>
    <p>How­ever, younger vot­ers also gained the most po­lit­i­cal knowl­edge com­pared with dur­ing 2015.</p>
    <p>“This points to the need to en­cour­age not just ac­tive cit­i­zenry, but in­formed cit­i­zenry,” said Dr Natalie Pang, a senior lec­turer at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) De­part­ment of Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and New Me­dia, and a mem­ber of the re­search team</p>
    <p>SWING VOT­ERS</p>
    <p>Those who voted for the PAP in 2015 but voted for the op­po­si­tion this year were more likely to be men. They were also more po­lit­i­cally ac­tive, hav­ing signed a pe­ti­tion in the last six months or at­tended op­po­si­tion e-ral­lies.</p>
    <p>This group was the least con­cerned about the qual­ity of can­di­dates and the par­ties’ track record, and more con­cerned about hav­ing al­ter­na­tive views in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Those who switched sides to the PAP this year cited the qual­ity of can­di­dates as their big­gest con­cern. They were gen­er­ally un­in­ter­ested and in­ac­tive in pol­i­tics, and at­tended e-ral­lies the least.</p>
    <p>Swing vot­ers did not dif­fer from non-swing vot­ers in their use of mass me­dia and so­cial me­dia, said NUS De­part­ment of Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and New Me­dia As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Zhang Weiyu, a mem­ber of the re­search team.</p>
    <p>“What in­flu­enced their swing had more to do with want­ing al­ter­na­tive views in Par­lia­ment, and lit­tle to do with us­ing so­cial me­dia,” she added.</p>
    <p>The key take­away, said Dr Soon, is that in­stant mes­sag­ing was the only plat­form that saw sim­i­larly high lev­els of adop­tion across all the age groups sur­veyed.</p>
    <p>But older vot­ers were more pas­sive in their in­stant mes­sag­ing ac­tiv­ity, she added.</p>
    <p>They used it to learn about the gen­eral elec­tion and can­di­dates, but did not ac­tively be­long to mes­sag­ing groups or dis­cuss pol­i­tics with other peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“Their con­tent could be quite dif­fer­ent from what younger vot­ers are cir­cu­lat­ing,” she said.</p>
    <p>“They could ei­ther be shar­ing screen­shots, or be on the re­ceiv­ing end of mes­sages from po­lit­i­cal par­ties, such as through What­sApp chan­nels.”</p>
