    <p>A $25 bil­lion plan chart­ing Sin­ga­pore’s re­search land­scape was launched yes­ter­day, a crit­i­cal in­vest­ment that will help the coun­try emerge stronger from the shadow of Covid-19. This in­cludes a na­tional re­search pro­gramme to help Sin­ga­pore re­spond nim­bly to fu­ture in­fec­tious dis­eases.</p>
    <p>A $25 bil­lion plan chart­ing Sin­ga­pore’s re­search land­scape was launched yes­ter­day, a crit­i­cal in­vest­ment that will help the coun­try emerge stronger from the shadow of Covid-19 while en­sur­ing that it shores up its de­fences against fu­ture threats.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes a na­tional re­search pro­gramme to help Sin­ga­pore re­spond nim­bly to fu­ture in­fec­tious dis­eases.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated tech­no­log­i­cal trends and struc­tural changes that will re­shape the global econ­omy, and has thrown up new chal­lenges for so­ci­eties, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said yes­ter­day dur­ing a vir­tual press con­fer­ence to lay out the Re­search, In­no­va­tion and En­ter­prise (RIE) 2025 plan.</p>
    <p>“Sci­ence, tech­nol­ogy and in­no­va­tion will be crit­i­cal to over­com­ing Covid-19 and in en­abling us to emerge stronger,” added Mr Heng, who also chairs the Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion (NRF).</p>
    <p>The $25 bil­lion is equiv­a­lent to around 1 per cent of the na­tion’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP). This pro­por­tion has re­mained rel­a­tively con­stant over the years, and puts Sin­ga­pore’s pub­lic in­vest­ment into re­search on a par with other small ad­vanced economies such as Swe­den and Den­mark, said NRF.</p>
    <p>One-third of the bud­get will go to­wards ba­sic re­search, whose ben­e­fits may not be im­me­di­ately ob­vi­ous. The five-year blue­print will fo­cus on four key ar­eas – health, sus­tain­abil­ity, the dig­i­tal econ­omy and man­u­fac­tur­ing, with firm sup­port for ba­sic re­search.</p>
    <p>The scope un­der each do­main will be ex­panded to meet the broader spec­trum of na­tional needs, said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, re­search into man­u­fac­tur­ing will now also in­clude stud­ies into the air and sea links that con­nect Sin­ga­pore with the rest of the world, while ur­ban so­lu­tions and sus­tain­abil­ity will now in­clude re­search into the new chal­lenges posed by cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>Health and bio­med­i­cal sciences have been ex­panded to hu­man health and po­ten­tial to ad­dress a key na­tional pri­or­ity – a rapidly age­ing pop­u­la­tion, Mr Heng noted. “We seek to bring the best out of ev­ery in­di­vid­ual by fo­cus­ing on im­prov­ing pre­na­tal and early child­hood devel­op­ment, learn­ing out­comes in chil­dren and adults, and the health and con­tri­bu­tion span of our se­niors.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides the four ar­eas, there will be $3.75 bil­lion set aside for “white space” re­search, up from $2.5 bil­lion in RIE2020. This is fund­ing ded­i­cated to new or emerg­ing ar­eas of re­search that may arise and is open to pro­pos­als from all agencies.</p>
    <p>The com­mit­ment un­der­scores the im­por­tance of re­search even dur­ing dif­fi­cult times, said NRF chief Low Teck Seng.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cur­rent cri­sis, the sci­en­tific com­mu­nity in Sin­ga­pore ral­lied even dur­ing the early stages of the pan­demic, piv­ot­ing away from their orig­i­nal re­search ar­eas and ap­ply­ing their ex­per­tise to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“In­vest­ments in sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy are an in­vest­ment in the fu­ture,” said Pro­fes­sor Low, not­ing that such in­vest­ments could also pro­vide good jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans, and en­hance and con­trib­ute to the na­tion’s GDP growth.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, in­vest­ing in wa­ter tech­nolo­gies had not only helped this wa­ter-scarce na­tion over­come its re­source con­straints, but also built a thriv­ing in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said the sci­en­tific mind­set is crit­i­cal. “The sci­en­tific mind­set – ex­plor­ing the world and un­der­stand­ing it ra­tio­nally and em­pir­i­cally – is cru­cial to Sin­ga­pore. This is true not just in R&D work, but more fun­da­men­tally to the ethos of our whole so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee, who chaired the RIE Coun­cil meet­ing on Thurs­day night, added: “Our con­tin­ued in­vest­ments in R&D will sus­tain our com­pet­i­tive­ness and bol­ster our sta­tus as a tech and in­no­va­tion hub.”</p>
    <p>A to­tal of $2.2 bil­lion will be spent on train­ing fu­ture re­searchers and sci­en­tists over the next five years un­der Sin­ga­pore’s Re­search, In­no­va­tion and En­ter­prise (RIE) 2025 plan.</p>
    <p>The plan maps out the coun­try’s re­search and devel­op­ment strat­egy over the next five years.</p>
    <p>The al­lo­ca­tion for train­ing sci­en­tists and re­searchers ac­counts for about one-tenth of the RIE2025 fund­ing pie and rep­re­sents an in­crease of about $300 mil­lion from RIE2020.</p>
    <p>In­creased fund­ing in the area un­der­scores Sin­ga­pore’s ef­forts to re­main com­pet­i­tive and boost in­no­va­tion in the wake of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The money will go to­wards fund­ing about 4,700 post­grad­u­ate schol­ar­ships, a 10 per cent in­crease from RIE2020, as well as 1,000 new trainee­ships and jobs.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude more than 800 re­search as­sis­tant and re­search fel­low po­si­tions in Sin­ga­pore’s uni­ver­si­ties and re­search in­sti­tutes; 175 ap­pren­tice­ship po­si­tions in AI Sin­ga­pore, which is a na­tional pro­gramme to catal­yse, syn­er­gise and boost Sin­ga­pore’s ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence ca­pa­bil­i­ties; and 30 trainee­ships in lo­cal deep-tech and soft­ware devel­op­ment start-ups un­der SGIn­no­vate’s Sum­ma­tion pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>At a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said that tech­nol­ogy and in­no­va­tion have cre­ated tremen­dous op­por­tu­ni­ties for busi­nesses which are able to master them, but ex­posed those that are not able to keep pace with sharper com­pe­ti­tion and dis­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>“Com­pared to MNCs, many lo­cal en­ter­prises are in the early stages of their in­no­va­tion jour­ney,” said Mr Heng, who is chair­man of the Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion. “They have less ex­pe­ri­ence in work­ing with the re­search com­mu­nity and are less able to trans­late re­search in­no­va­tions into new prod­ucts, ser­vices and so­lu­tions for the mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>A com­mon chal­lenge among com­pa­nies, he added, has been to iden­tify new tech­nolo­gies rel­e­vant to their in­dus­tries and the right peo­ple to ap­ply th­ese tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>To this end, a new In­no­va­tion and En­ter­prise Fel­low­ship pro­gramme will also be launched un­der RIE2025 to ex­pand the tal­ent pool with skills in tech­nol­ogy com­mer­cial­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme will pro­vide in­di­vid­u­als with men­tor­ships and on­the-job train­ing via at­tach­ments with pub­lic and pri­vate sec­tor plat­forms, in­clud­ing cor­po­rate lab­o­ra­to­ries, pri­vate sec­tor in­cu­ba­tors and ac­cel­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment-owned ven­ture firm and deep tech de­vel­oper SGIn­no­vate – which has launched its own pro­gramme to train tal­ent in robotics en­gi­neer­ing roles – is among 11 part­ners that have joined the pro­gramme so far.</p>
    <p>Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion Min­is­ter S. Iswaran, who was also at the press con­fer­ence, said tal­ent devel­op­ment is cru­cial for Sin­ga­pore to build a strong foun­da­tion of sci­en­tists and en­gi­neers who will “push the bound­aries of tech­nol­ogy” and help the coun­try suc­ceed as a trusted dig­i­tal in­no­va­tion hub.</p>
    <p>“(Sci­en­tists and en­gi­neers) must also be com­ple­mented by prod­uct man­agers and strate­gists that can trans­late re­search find­ings into use­ful prod­ucts and ser­vices, and bring th­ese ideas to mar­ket quickly,” he added.</p>
