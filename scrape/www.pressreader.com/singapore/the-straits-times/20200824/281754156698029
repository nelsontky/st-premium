    <p>SYD­NEY • Aus­tralia recorded a fur­ther 17 new coro­n­avirus deaths yes­ter­day, but in­fec­tions in the hard-hit state of Vic­to­ria, the site of all the lat­est deaths, are show­ing a down­ward trend, the au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>Other than in Vic­to­ria, which ac­counts for more than 80 per cent of Aus­tralia’s Covid-19 deaths due to a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions, the coun­try has largely avoided the high ca­su­alty num­bers of many na­tions, with about 24,500 in­fec­tions and 502 deaths.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, nearly 5,900 peo­ple are dy­ing every 24 hours from Covid-19 on av­er­age, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally, with the United States, Brazil and In­dia lead­ing the rise in fa­tal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­rian Pre­mier Daniel An­drews said the state, which is al­most half­way through a six-week lock­down, had con­firmed 208 new in­fec­tions in the pre­ced­ing 24 hours. That was higher than the 182 new cases re­ported on Satur­day, but was still lower than the weekly av­er­age, he said.</p>
    <p>“We are go­ing to de­feat this sec­ond wave,” Mr An­drews told re­porters. “And then we will be able to begin the process of open­ing up. Ex­actly when that is, we can’t give peo­ple a de­fin­i­tive date. But... my aim is to round out the year with some­thing – a Covid nor­mal.”</p>
    <p>The Pre­mier said 11 of the 17 deaths con­firmed in the 24 hours to yes­ter­day were linked to virus out­breaks at aged-care fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In the state cap­i­tal Mel­bourne, pro­duc­tion of re­al­ity TV se­ries The Masked Singer was halted af­ter sev­eral crew mem­bers tested pos­i­tive for the virus, the Vi­a­com-CBS In­cowned free-to-air broad­caster Ten Net­work said in a so­cial me­dia post.</p>
    <p>Else­where, New South Wales, the most pop­u­lous state, and the north­east­ern state of Queens­land re­ported five new cases com­bined yes­ter­day. Western Aus­tralia re­ported one new in­fec­tion, the first con­firmed case since last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>As the spread of the dis­ease slows, state and fed­eral gov­ern­ments have been dis­cussing eas­ing the cap on re­turn­ing Australian­s of 4,000 per week to help repa­tri­ate those stranded overseas, the Syd­ney Morn­ing Her­ald re­ported.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice did not re­turn re­quests for com­ment.</p>
    <p>In neigh­bour­ing New Zealand, the health au­thor­i­ties re­ported three new pos­i­tive cases yes­ter­day.</p>
