    <p>As at June 30, the air­line had an unau­dited deficit in share­hold­ers’ eq­uity of RM960 mil­lion (S$313.5 mil­lion), and its unau­dited cur­rent li­a­bil­i­ties of RM3.38 bil­lion ex­ceeded unau­dited cur­rent as­sets of RM1.39 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>KUALA LUMPUR AirAsia Group’s long-haul arm has pro­posed a sweep­ing re­struc­tur­ing plan that would wipe out al­most RM63.5 bil­lion (S$20.7 bil­lion) in debt and save the Malaysian car­rier from be­ing dragged un­der by avi­a­tion’s worst cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The pro­posal, which re­quires ap­proval from in­vestors and cred­i­tors, would re­duce share­holder cap­i­tal at AirAsia X by 90 per cent, ac­cord­ing to an ex­change fil­ing on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The air­line said go­ing through with the over­haul is the only way for it to sur­vive and emerge from its ground­ing since late March.</p>
    <p>“To avoid a liq­ui­da­tion and to al­low the air­line to fly again, the only op­tion is for AirAsia X to un­der­take a group-wide debt and cor­po­rate re­struc­tur­ing and up­date its business model,” AirAsia X said.</p>
    <p>Given the cur­rent out­look, “the group will not be able to meet its im­me­di­ate debt and other fi­nan­cial com­mit­ments”.</p>
    <p>Par­ent AirAsia Group has been un­der im­mense pres­sure this year since the coro­n­avirus pan­demic all but elim­i­nated air travel de­mand.</p>
    <p>South-east Asia’s sec­ond-big­gest bud­get car­rier, once a poster child for the re­gion’s low-cost travel rev­o­lu­tion, re­ported its largest loss on record in the quar­ter ended June 30.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive Tony Fer­nan­des has been in talks for joint ven­tures and col­lab­o­ra­tions that may re­sult in ad­di­tional in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>The 13-year-old AirAsia X unit had been fo­cused on grow­ing its fleet and ex­pand­ing to far­ther des­ti­na­tions such as Abu Dhabi and Delhi. It was strug­gling be­fore the cri­sis hit, with on­go­ing losses and too much debt.</p>
    <p>Now the car­rier is vow­ing to rein in its am­bi­tions if it can sur­vive. “Go­ing for­ward, AirAsia X will strive to re­bound as a low-cost, medi­umhaul air­line with a leaner and more sus­tain­able cost base.”</p>
    <p>The plan would elim­i­nate 99 per cent of AirAsia X’s obli­ga­tions – in­clud­ing air­craft lease and pur­chase com­mit­ments, and penalties for can­celling or­ders, re­duc­ing its debt to RM200 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>It would also con­sol­i­date ev­ery 10 ex­ist­ing AirAsia X shares into one while rais­ing RM500 mil­lion in fresh fund­ing, in­clud­ing eq­uity and a gov­ern­ment-guar­an­teed loan.</p>
    <p>The pro­posal re­quires ap­proval from share­hold­ers as well as from cred­i­tors such as lenders, suppliers and leas­ing com­pa­nies that ac­count for 75 per cent of AirAsia X’s ex­ist­ing debt. It must also be sanc­tioned by the Malaysian High Court.</p>
    <p>As at June 30, the air­line had an unau­dited deficit in share­hold­ers’ eq­uity of RM960 mil­lion, and its unau­dited cur­rent li­a­bil­i­ties of RM3.38 bil­lion ex­ceeded unau­dited cur­rent as­sets of RM1.39 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The car­rier said it hopes to be­gin op­er­at­ing with two air­craft in se­lected mar­kets in the first quar­ter of next year and grad­u­ally re­sume flights to all des­ti­na­tions by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>It ex­pects to com­plete the re­struc­tur­ing by next March.</p>
    <p>Datuk Lim Kian Onn, who has been a mem­ber of the board since 2012, has been ap­pointed deputy chair­man to head the re­struc­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>GROW­ING TROU­BLES</p>
    <p>AirAsia X’s grow­ing trou­bles had been widely flagged. The car­rier in late Au­gust said it faced se­vere liq­uid­ity con­straints that threat­ened its abil­ity to re­sume fly­ing and con­tinue as a go­ing con­cern, and that it needed to reach agree­ments with ma­jor cred­i­tors to re­struc­ture debt.</p>
    <p>It also said that it sought sup­port from air­craft lessors, main­te­nance providers and fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to restart flights early next year.</p>
    <p>In July, au­di­tor Ernst & Young said there may be “sig­nif­i­cant doubt” over AirAsia X’s abil­ity to con­tinue as a go­ing con­cern.</p>
    <p>One ques­tion mark is the fate of a large back­log of air­craft on or­der from man­u­fac­turer Air­bus. The Euro­pean plane­maker is par­tic­u­larly ex­posed through its A-330neo, with 78 or­ders from AirAsia X mak­ing up a quar­ter of the back­log.</p>
    <p>Air­bus low­ered A-330 out­put to two jets a month in April, af­ter AirAsia X post­poned de­liv­er­ies and the virus slammed air­craft de­mand. The Malaysian car­rier also has 30 A-321neos and 10 A350-900s still to be de­liv­ered.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean plane­maker is in dis­cus­sions with its cus­tomer “to find pos­si­ble so­lu­tions dur­ing this very chal­leng­ing time”. It said the A-330neo “will prove to be a most ef­fec­tive op­tion for air­lines as they emerge from the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>Air­lines glob­ally have grounded thou­sands of planes as gov­ern­ments re­stricted move­ment to curb the spread of the virus. Car­ri­ers have been rais­ing funds via rights of­fer­ings and seek­ing state sup­port in their ef­forts to stay afloat.</p>
    <p>Travel de­mand will not re­turn to pre-Covid lev­els un­til 2024, says the In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Vir­gin Aus­tralia Hold­ings and Colom­bia’s Avianca Hold­ings have col­lapsed, while Amer­i­can Air­lines Group and United Air­lines Hold­ings are cut­ting more than 32,000 em­ploy­ees com­bined. Sin­ga­pore Air­lines said last month it would have to elim­i­nate about 4,300 jobs, or 20 per cent of its work­force.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, other parts of Mr Fer­nan­des’ em­pire are show­ing strain. AirAsia said on Mon­day it will cease oper­a­tions in Ja­pan im­me­di­ately as it tries to re­duce cash burn.</p>
    <p>The group has also stopped fund­ing its In­dian af­fil­i­ate, peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said. AirAsia In­dia’s fu­ture may now de­pend on In­dia’s Tata Group, its ma­jor­ity share­holder, which has pro­vided emer­gency fund­ing but has yet to com­mit to a full res­cue.</p>
    <p>AirAsia X was al­ready strug­gling pre-pan­demic, post­ing losses for six out of the seven quar­ters to the end of last De­cem­ber. The long­haul group re­ported a net loss of RM305.2 mil­lion for the three months ended June 30, with sales tum­bling 91 per cent.</p>
    <p>Prior to the out­break, AirAsia X was the only Malaysian air­line that served the United States – from Kuala Lumpur to Hawaii via Osaka.</p>
    <p>Last Novem­ber, the US Fed­eral Avi­a­tion Ad­min­is­tra­tion down­graded Malaysia to Cat­e­gory 2, bar­ring its car­ri­ers from adding any more flights to North Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>Air Asia X’s Malaysia-listed stock is down 68 per cent this year, while shares in AirAsia Group have sunk 62 per cent.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple who have pur­chased or made advance pay­ments for flights that have been can­celled, or for fu­ture flights, will have their pay­ments and de­posits con­verted into travel cred­its, ac­cord­ing to the state­ment.</p>
