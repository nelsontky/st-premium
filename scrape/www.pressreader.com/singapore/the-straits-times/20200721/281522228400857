    <p>Pas­sen­ger move­ments at Changi Air­port rose last month, buoyed by the open­ing of a green lane between Sin­ga­pore and China, as well as the re­sump­tion of tran­sit flights.</p>
    <p>But the 48,200 pas­sen­ger move­ments are still 99.2 per cent lower than in the same pe­riod last year, data re­leased by Changi Air­port Group (CAG) yes­ter­day showed.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Air­lines Group has re­ported a sim­i­lar plunge in pas­sen­ger num­bers, with the 17,700 pas­sen­gers it car­ried last month a 99.5 per cent drop from last year.</p>
    <p>CAG said it is han­dling about 300 sched­uled pas­sen­ger flights a week this month, com­pared with around 170 pas­sen­ger flights a week in April.</p>
    <p>Avi­a­tion an­a­lysts said Sin­ga­pore’s avi­a­tion sec­tor will con­tinue to strug­gle for some time, as it has no do­mes­tic mar­ket and in­ter­na­tional flights are not ex­pected to re­turn to nor­mal lev­els for quite some time yet.</p>
    <p>The open­ing of the Sin­ga­pore-China green lane and the restart­ing of tran­sit flights helped to boost pas­sen­ger move­ments at Changi Air­port last month, but only barely.</p>
    <p>The num­ber – 48,200 – is still 99.2 per cent be­low what it was in the same pe­riod last year, data re­leased by Changi Air­port Group (CAG) showed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) Group has re­ported a sim­i­lar plunge in pas­sen­ger num­bers, with the 17,700 pas­sen­gers it car­ried last month a 99.5 per cent drop from last year.</p>
    <p>The num­bers re­flect the chal­lenges ahead for the lo­cal avi­a­tion sec­tor as it grap­ples with the im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>CAG told The Straits Times that it has han­dled more than 10,000 tran­sit pas­sen­ger move­ments since the grad­ual re­open­ing to tran­sit flights on June 2, “though th­ese still re­main at very low lev­els com­pared to pre-Covid-19”.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, only flights by the SIA Group – com­pris­ing SIA, SilkAir and Scoot – from se­lected cities are al­lowed to tran­sit at Changi.</p>
    <p>CAG said it is han­dling about 300 sched­uled pas­sen­ger flights per week this month, com­pared with around 170 per week in April, the first month af­ter the ban on short­term vis­i­tors to Sin­ga­pore kicked in.</p>
    <p>SIA told The Straits Times that the pan­demic con­tin­ues to have a se­vere im­pact on in­ter­na­tional air travel.</p>
    <p>“Progress to­wards a global lift­ing of bor­der con­trols and travel re­stric­tions, which could fa­cil­i­tate or re­sult in the eas­ier move­ment of trav­ellers between coun­tries, is slower than ear­lier ex­pected,” said SIA.</p>
    <p>“Con­se­quently, for now, pas­sen­ger traf­fic re­mains low.”</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, about 140 of the SIA Group’s to­tal fleet of about 200 planes re­main grounded.</p>
    <p>While still a tiny per­cent­age of what they were pre­vi­ously, flights op­er­ated by SIA, SilkAir and Scoot have also been grad­u­ally in­creas­ing af­ter hit­ting rock bot­tom in April.</p>
    <p>SIA and SilkAir will op­er­ate a to­tal of 546 pas­sen­ger flights this month, com­pared with 308 in April. Scoot will op­er­ate more than 100 flights this month, dou­bling the num­ber from April.</p>
    <p>On what its key plans are in the near fu­ture, SIA re­it­er­ated a point it made pre­vi­ously about an on­go­ing re­view of its op­er­a­tions by a task force.</p>
    <p>“This task force is look­ing into every as­pect of our op­er­a­tions, en­sur­ing that the com­pany is ready to step up and be ready when the re­cov­ery comes,” said SIA.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, bud­get car­rier Jet­star Asia has sus­pended the ma­jor­ity of its flights un­til the end of this month, with the ex­cep­tion of some flights to Bangkok, Manila and Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>It will re­move five Air­bus A320 air­craft from its fleet of 18 planes and cut 180 jobs in line with the re­duced fleet. The ma­jor­ity of its work­force are on fur­lough un­til at least the end of the year.</p>
    <p>SIA, Scoot and Jet­star have also de­ployed staff to ex­ter­nal roles such as trans­port am­bas­sadors.</p>
    <p>Scoot said more than 620 flight crew mem­bers are cur­rently on sec­ondary em­ploy­ment. Jet­star Asia said more than 300 of its staff are now in roles to pre­vent fur­ther spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mr Bren­dan So­bie from So­bie Avi­a­tion said it could take sev­eral more months for pas­sen­ger traf­fic in Sin­ga­pore to start record­ing sig­nif­i­cant im­prove­ments.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­body knew it was go­ing to be a very long and tough re­cov­ery for Sin­ga­pore be­cause there is no do­mes­tic mar­ket, but right now the slow pace in re­open­ing the in­ter­na­tional mar­ket across Asia is mak­ing the out­look for the rest of the year even bleaker than ex­pected a few months ago,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr So­bie pointed out that the re­open­ing to tran­sit traf­fic has not had a sig­nif­i­cant im­pact due to weak over­all de­mand for in­ter­na­tional air travel and new re­stric­tions by Aus­tralia and New Zealand lim­it­ing repa­tri­at­ing traf­fic.</p>
    <p>Avi­a­tion an­a­lyst Shukor Yu­sof of En­dau An­a­lyt­ics said: “Sin­ga­pore from the out­set has been prag­matic and un­der­stood it will take a while be­fore nor­mal­ity re­sumes, and the sec­tor has re­acted ac­cord­ingly.”</p>
