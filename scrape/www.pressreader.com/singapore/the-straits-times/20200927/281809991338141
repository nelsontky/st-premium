    <p>The pres­i­dent of one of Sin­ga­pore’s largest recre­ational clubs, poised to be re­turned un­op­posed for another term af­ter two can­di­dates were dis­qual­i­fied, will have to face a chal­lenger for the post fol­low­ing a High Court or­der ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Judge An­drew Ang is­sued an in­terim or­der hold­ing that the de­ci­sion of the Sin­ga­pore Swim­ming Club man­age­ment com­mit­tee to dis­qual­ify the nom­i­na­tion of Mr S. Radakr­ish­nan for pres­i­dent shall not take ef­fect, if at all, un­til the court de­cides on the case he filed.</p>
    <p>The court fur­ther ruled that the de­ci­sion of the club’s man­age­ment com­mit­tee on Sept 11 to de­clare that Mr Yeo Chui Hee is the sole can­di­date for the po­si­tion of pres­i­dent and that he is re­turned un­op­posed shall not take ef­fect, if at all, un­til the court de­cides on the claims.</p>
    <p>The club was also di­rected to place a copy of the court or­der on its no­tice boards and web­site.</p>
    <p>The club’s gen­eral elec­tion is due to­day, and Mr Radakr­ish­nan, a for­mer pres­i­dent of the club, is lead­ing a team to stand for var­i­ous posts against the in­cum­bent’s team.</p>
    <p>The club, through its lawyer Chang Man Phing, said Mr Radakr­ish­nan will be al­lowed to stand for elec­tion.</p>
    <p>She added that the court has not de­ter­mined whether he should be dis­qual­i­fied and the is­sue will be de­cided by the court only at a hear­ing, which has not been fixed yet.</p>
    <p>“This means that in the event that Mr Rada is elected into of­fice as pres­i­dent, and if the court de­cides in favour of the club, Mr Rada will have to step down from the po­si­tion.”</p>
    <p>“The club de­nies all the claims made by Mr Rada in his ex parte ap­pli­ca­tion – which means that the club was not given an op­por­tu­nity to present its ver­sion of events be­fore the court when the court made its de­ci­sion,” she added.</p>
    <p>The club de­clined fur­ther com­ment as the mat­ter is still pend­ing be­fore the court.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, Mr Radakr­ish­nan’s lawyer, Se­nior Coun­sel N. Sreeni­vasan, said that when nom­i­na­tion pa­pers were filed on Sept 9 for the post, it was ac­cepted by the re­turn­ing of­fi­cer and he was not dis­qual­i­fied based on the club’s by-laws.</p>
    <p>He ar­gued that on Sept 11, six man­age­ment com­mit­tee mem­bers had wrong­fully dis­qual­i­fied Mr Radakr­ish­nan’s nom­i­na­tion as a can­di­date for club pres­i­dent by re­ly­ing on a sep­a­rate rule for its de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Two can­di­dates were dis­qual­i­fied but the other mem­ber did not take the case to court.</p>
    <p>The hear­ing was held in cham­bers where the plain­tiff ar­gued be­fore Jus­tice Ang that the dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion meant he would have lost the op­por­tu­nity to stand for pres­i­dent and mem­bers would have lost the op­por­tu­nity of an elec­tion for the post.</p>
