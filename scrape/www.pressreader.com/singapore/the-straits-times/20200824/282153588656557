    <p>The dis­pute last week in­volv­ing an SBS Transit bus driver who re­fused to let on board a com­muter who was wear­ing a gaiter was a hot topic on­line.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent raises the ques­tion of whether gaiters are ac­cept­able “masks”. Will the Min­istry of Health step in and clar­ify this pub­licly in or­der to pre­vent sim­i­lar in­ci­dents in fu­ture?</p>
    <p>Af­ter a quick look at the Covid-19 con­trol reg­u­la­tions, it seems cloth and gaiters fit the def­i­ni­tion of masks. SBS Transit must then clar­ify pub­licly if it has very clear guide­lines to staff on whether gaiters or other cloth masks are al­lowed.</p>
    <p>Given that the Govern­ment has dis­trib­uted cloth masks twice to house­holds, one would as­sume this cat­e­gory of masks is al­lowed any­where.</p>
    <p>As­sum­ing SBS Transit al­lows cloth masks un­der the def­i­ni­tion of the law, then were the ac­tions of the driver wrong? This must be in­ves­ti­gated and made pub­lic in or­der to leave no doubt as to what is and is not al­lowed.</p>
    <p>This has im­pli­ca­tions for the broader so­ci­ety as a num­ber of com­muters were af­fected that day be­cause of the in­ci­dent.</p>
