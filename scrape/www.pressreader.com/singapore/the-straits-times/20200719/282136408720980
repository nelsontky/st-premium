    <p>Mr Mo­hamed Fadly was de­lighted when he se­cured a slot on­line for a Fri­day prayer ser­vice at the mosque three weeks ago.</p>
    <p>It was the first time the 37-yearold had stepped into a mosque since March, when all 70 mosques here were closed to curb the spread of the coro­n­avirus. Con­gre­ga­tional prayers were al­lowed to re­sume on June 26.</p>
    <p>That day, Mr Fadly, who has been pray­ing at home and watch­ing ser­mons on YouTube in the last few months, turned up at the AlIstigh­far Mosque in Pasir Ris for its first Fri­day prayer ses­sion at 1pm.</p>
    <p>Even though the ser­mon was shorter than usual, noth­ing beats hear­ing it in per­son, he says.</p>
    <p>“I feel thank­ful and grate­ful, and hope things will get bet­ter and that more con­gre­gants can take part in Fri­day prayers.”</p>
    <p>Mr Fadly, who works in the security in­dus­try, was among the lucky wor­ship­pers who man­aged to get a slot for a Fri­day prayer ses­sion, each re­stricted to 50 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Devo­tees are al­lowed into the mosque only if they have a book­ing, which they can make via an on­line sys­tem run by the Is­lamic Re­li­gious Council of Sin­ga­pore (Muis). To al­low more wor­ship­pers to per­form Fri­day prayers, each per­son can book only one slot ev­ery three weeks.</p>
    <p>There was over­whelm­ing de­mand for the lim­ited slots – un­sur­pris­ingly, as Fri­day ser­vices typ­i­cally at­tract ca­pac­ity crowds.</p>
    <p>On June 26, mosques re­sumed ser­vice with two sessions. Be­cause the sessions went smoothly in the last few weeks, 48 mosques added an ex­tra ses­sion from last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Be­sides SafeEn­try check-ins, tem­per­a­ture screen­ings and hav­ing to wear a mask, there are sev­eral other safe man­age­ment prac­tices con­gre­gants have to ad­here to.</p>
    <p>Mr Fadly says he had to use his own prayer mat and stay in a des­ig­nated space 1m from the near­est devo­tees.</p>
    <p>The imam who led the prayers, Us­taz Maaz Salim, de­liv­ered his ser­mon with a face shield on, and stood 2m from the first row of con­gre­gants.</p>
    <p>The mosque had to turn away sev­eral peo­ple who were not aware of the new guide­lines. Some had not se­cured a book­ing, while oth­ers did not bring their prayer items.</p>
    <p>But over­all, the sessions went smoothly, notes Mr Az­man Mohd Arif­fin, Al-Istigh­far’s ex­ec­u­tive chair­man.</p>
    <p>“We feel blessed we can now con­duct Fri­day prayers. The num­ber of con­gre­gants might be small for now, but this is the first small step,” the 57-year-old says, adding that prayer spa­ces are thor­oughly cleaned be­fore and af­ter ev­ery ses­sion.</p>
    <p>Since mosques had to close on March 13 – af­ter two Sin­ga­pore­ans who at­tended a mass re­li­gious gath­er­ing in Se­lan­gor, Malaysia, tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 – Muis has taken a cau­tious ap­proach.</p>
    <p>The in­crease in sessions was done in ac­cor­dance with ad­vi­sories is­sued by the multi-min­istry task­force on the coro­n­avirus and the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth, when more re­li­gious ac­tiv­i­ties were al­lowed to re­sume in phase two.</p>
    <p>Mosques are pre­pared to act quickly if an in­fected per­son is found to have vis­ited their premises. When it was dis­cov­ered that one such per­son had been to Al-An­sar Mosque in Be­dok North for evening prayers eight times be­tween June 26 and July 2, it was closed for two days for clean­ing and dis­in­fec­tion. It has since re­opened and re­sumed prayer ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Many other mosque ac­tiv­i­ties re­main on hold or have been ad­justed.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the an­nual ko­r­ban rit­ual dur­ing Hari Raya Haji, which falls on July 31, will not take place in Sin­ga­pore this year. Mosques will in­stead ar­range for the sac­ri­fi­cial slaugh­ter of live­stock to be per­formed in Aus­tralia. The meat will then be chilled and shipped here.</p>
    <p>The mosques’ so­cial-me­dia chan­nels are also ac­tive with live streams and pre-recorded videos.</p>
    <p>In April, Muis launched a Web­based chan­nel called SalamSG TV, which fea­tures re­li­gious talks and videos in Malay, Tamil, English and Ben­gali to cater to Mus­lim for­eign work­ers here.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tional ac­tiv­i­ties have also moved on­line. Madrasah classes for Mus­lim youth now take place on video-con­fer­enc­ing plat­form Zoom.</p>
    <p>Mr Azryn Yek’s 10-year-old son and eight-year-old daugh­ter at­tend on­line classes con­ducted by Jamiyah Ar-Rabitah Mosque in Bukit Merah ev­ery Satur­day.</p>
    <p>“My kids miss the per­sonal touch of their teach­ers at the phys­i­cal classes,” says the 42-year-old, who works in the build­ing so­lu­tions in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“I look for­ward to the day when we can all go back to the mosques.”</p>
