    <p>A new 900 sq m ther­a­peu­tic gar­den has opened at Pung­gol Wa­ter­way Park, mak­ing it more convenient for el­derly res­i­dents in the north-east to ex­pe­ri­ence ther­a­peu­tic hor­ti­cul­ture, which has been shown to be calm­ing, lift moods and in­stil op­ti­mism in par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>It is the sixth of 30 such gar­dens the Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) will de­velop in pub­lic parks by 2030, when one in four Sin­ga­pore­ans will be aged 65 and above.</p>
    <p>The net­work was an ini­tia­tive out­lined in the Ac­tion Plan for Suc­cess­ful Age­ing re­port an­nounced by the Min­is­te­rial Com­mit­tee on Age­ing in 2015.</p>
    <p>Based on sci­ence-based prin­ci­ples, ther­a­peu­tic gar­dens pro­mote in­ter­ac­tion with na­ture and im­prove the men­tal well-be­ing of vis­i­tors by help­ing them to de­stress.</p>
    <p>These are also sites where se­niors from nearby nurs­ing homes and el­der­care cen­tres can par­tic­i­pate in ther­a­peu­tic hor­ti­cul­ture, a fa­cil­i­tated form of gar­den­ing and plant-re­lated tasks with pre­set goals such as stim­u­lat­ing mem­ory.</p>
    <p>Ms An­gelia Sia, deputy di­rec­tor of NParks’ Cen­tre for Ur­ban Green­ery and Ecol­ogy, said NParks has been re­search­ing the health and well-be­ing ben­e­fits of ther­a­peu­tic hor­ti­cul­ture since 2015.</p>
    <p>And re­cently, some of the re­search was pub­lished in high-im­pact jour­nals like Na­ture Sci­en­tific Re­ports and the Jour­nal of Geron­tol­ogy.</p>
    <p>While sim­i­lar re­search has been done in tem­per­ate coun­tries, the stud­ies done here are the first in the world to show the ben­e­fits in a trop­i­cal cli­mate set­ting, she said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s first ther­a­peu­tic gar­den in a pub­lic park opened in HortPark in 2016.</p>
    <p>Four oth­ers were then built in Tiong Bahru Park, Bis­han-Ang Mo Kio Park, Choa Chu Kang Park and Telok Blan­gah Hill Park.</p>
    <p>Like the other ther­a­peu­tic gar­dens in Sin­ga­pore, the new one at Pung­gol Wa­ter­way Park is rel­a­tively small – about the size of 10 four-room flats – but comes packed with fea­tures that se­niors, par­tic­u­larly those who are not so mo­bile, use wheel­chairs or have de­men­tia, may ap­pre­ci­ate.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the gar­den fea­tures two raised planter boxes, which al­low wheel­chair users to en­joy plant main­te­nance, or sim­ply to see and touch the plants.</p>
    <p>There are brightly coloured flow­ers and fa­mil­iar plants such as pan­dan to ex­cite the senses. A bar chime at the shel­tered deck cre­ates nat­u­ral melodies that soothe and calm. And there is a fit­ness area over­look­ing the wa­ter­way.</p>
    <p>NParks had to halt all ther­a­peu­tic hor­ti­cul­ture ses­sions ow­ing to the Covid-19 pan­demic but be­fore this, more than 130 ses­sions of ther­a­peu­tic hor­ti­cul­ture pro­grammes had been con­ducted at ther­a­peu­tic gar­dens since late 2016.</p>
    <p>In these pro­grammes, there can be a com­bi­na­tion of tasks like grow­ing pea sprouts or mak­ing com­post, and na­ture art­work such as sketch­ing leaves or doing a flo­ral ar­range­ment.</p>
    <p>These ac­tiv­i­ties help to in­crease so­cial in­ter­ac­tion and pro­mote in­ter­est in na­ture.</p>
    <p>In one of the re­cent NParks re­search pa­pers, an anal­y­sis of blood sam­ples showed that the gen­eral im­mune health of older adults who had been in­volved in a ther­a­peu­tic hor­ti­cul­ture pro­gramme was bet­ter than that of the con­trol group.</p>
    <p>“The im­pli­ca­tion is that ther­a­peu­tic hor­ti­cul­ture may po­ten­tially boost im­mu­nity and mod­er­ate geri­atric con­di­tions, in­clud­ing in­flam­ma­tory dis­eases, de­men­tia and de­pres­sion,” said Ms Sia.</p>
    <p>An­other project done to in­ves­ti­gate the ef­fects of ther­a­peu­tic hor­ti­cul­ture on el­derly peo­ple who are at risk of cog­ni­tive de­cline found that 47 older adults from three se­nior day­care cen­tres who at­tended weekly ses­sions at the Ther­a­peu­tic Gar­den@HortPark for 24 weeks were sig­nif­i­cantly less anx­ious, hap­pier and showed im­prove­ment in cog­ni­tive func­tion.</p>
    <p>“Anec­do­tally, we could see par­tic­i­pants open­ing and bright­en­ing up more with each ses­sion,” said Ms Sia. “We also ob­served that they main­tained healthy sleep pat­terns and psy­cho­log­i­cal health.”</p>
    <p>The re­search re­sults lend weight to NParks’ push to spread ther­a­peu­tic hor­ti­cul­ture to nurs­ing homes and the community, al­beit slowly given pan­demic times.</p>
    <p>It held this year’s first community ther­a­peu­tic hor­ti­cul­ture train­ing ses­sion for two community gar­den lead­ers and an am­bas­sador for community gar­den­ing around a fort­night ago.</p>
    <p>They can then go on to con­duct these ac­tiv­i­ties for free in the community. Three such pi­lot ses­sions, each for a group of 20, were con­ducted last year.</p>
    <p>NParks will also hold train­ing ses­sions for nurs­ing homes, so they can run these pro­grammes on their own and start their own gar­dens if they are keen, said its di­rec­tor of hor­ti­cul­ture and community gar­den­ing Kay Pungkothai.</p>
    <p>But ther­a­peu­tic hor­ti­cul­ture ses­sions at the parks for res­i­dents from nurs­ing homes or el­der­care cen­tres will have to wait till a safer time.</p>
    <p>NParks also works with part­ners like hospi­tals to de­velop ther­a­peu­tic gar­dens in their premises. Cur­rently, there are 11 ther­a­peu­tic hor­ti­cul­ture gar­dens or nodes in hospi­tals and nurs­ing homes.</p>
    <p>Ms Pungkothai said that with the re­search show­ing good re­sults from ther­a­peu­tic gar­dens, the plan is also to let chil­dren with spe­cial needs, such as those with phys­i­cal dis­abil­i­ties, mild autism or at­ten­tion deficit hy­per­ac­tiv­ity dis­or­der, ben­e­fit from it.</p>
    <p>NParks did not say when the plan will be ready but in­for­ma­tion on its web­site showed that the ther­a­peu­tic gar­den in Jurong Lake Gar­dens, which will be ready in the first half of next year, will have a sec­tion de­signed for chil­dren with dis­abil­i­ties and a sec­tion de­signed for el­derly peo­ple with de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>HEAL­ING POWER OF NA­TURE</p>
    <p>The im­pli­ca­tion is that ther­a­peu­tic hor­ti­cul­ture may po­ten­tially boost im­mu­nity and mod­er­ate geri­atric con­di­tions, in­clud­ing in­flam­ma­tory dis­eases, de­men­tia and de­pres­sion.</p>
