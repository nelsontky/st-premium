    <p>Is the mar­riage of My Fair Princess ac­tress Ruby Lin on the rocks?</p>
    <p>The ques­tion arose af­ter Lin and her hus­band, ac­tor Wal­lace Huo, were seen quar­relling in pub­lic last week. The Tai­wanese ac­tress has also deleted her re­cent pho­tos with Huo on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Lin, 44, and Huo, 39, mar­ried in 2016 and they have a three-yearold daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>How­ever, they have been dogged by ru­mours of di­vorce since late last year, in part be­cause of a lack of dis­play of af­fec­tion be­tween them in pub­lic.</p>
    <p>On Oct 6, Lin seemed to have put the ru­mours to rest when she posted sev­eral pho­tos of her with Huo and a photo of her hand hold­ing their three-year-old daugh­ter’s hand while wear­ing iden­ti­cal bracelets.</p>
    <p>Lin, who shot to fame with the pe­riod drama My Fair Princess (1998) and re­cently acted in the Tai­wanese crime thriller The Vic­tim’s Game, had cap­tioned the pho­tos: “Are you smil­ing to­day”, with hash­tags such as #the­world will­be­bet­ter­with­moresmile­sand­kind­ness and #ev­ery­day­isa­day­filled­withlove­and­hope.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the ru­mour mill went into over­drive last Fri­day when they were filmed by Tai­wan’s Ap­ple Daily quar­relling openly i n the streets last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Tai­wanese news­pa­per, they went their sep­a­rate ways af­ter the ar­gu­ment, with Huo driv­ing back home with­out his wife, while Lin was seen in tears walk­ing aim­lessly on the streets.</p>
    <p>When ap­proached by Ap­ple Daily last Thurs­day, Lin told the news­pa­per she and Huo were merely dis­cussing things and had raised their voices due to a dif­fer­ence in opin­ion.</p>
    <p>She said she wanted to take a stroll af­ter her meal, and had asked Huo to fetch the car.</p>
    <p>She de­nied she had been cry­ing, and claimed that, as the rain got heav­ier, she sought shel­ter in a park. She said she took a taxi home even­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>It is un­cer­tain if the deleted pho­tos were linked to the quar­rel last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Last month, Lin de­nied talk that she and Huo were on the verge of di­vorc­ing.</p>
