    <p>It is never too late to pick up a new hobby. Last Satur­day night, veteran Hong Kong singer Alan Tam, 70, posted pho­tos of him­self pre­par­ing for a wa­ter sport, as he wrote: “To­day is the first time I am try­ing wakesurf­ing.”</p>
    <p>ALAN TAM MAK­ING WAVES AT 70: It is never too late to pick up a new hobby.</p>
    <p>Just ask Hong Kong singer Alan Tam, who turned 70 last month.</p>
    <p>He is a mem­ber of Can­topop band The Wyn­ners, which were formed in 1973 and are still go­ing strong. Other mem­bers of the band are Kenny Bee, Ben­nett Pang, Danny Yip and An­thony Chan, who are in their late 60s or early 70s.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day night, Tam posted pho­tos of him­self pre­par­ing for a wa­ter sport as he wrote: “To­day is the first time I am try­ing wakesurf­ing.”</p>
    <p>The next day, he put up more pic­tures and wrote: “A coun­try bump­kin do­ing wakesurf­ing for the first time.”</p>
    <p>While Tam seemed to be strug­gling in some of the pho­tos, he was seen smil­ing in oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral ne­ti­zens said the singer – known af­fec­tion­ately as Prin­ci­pal Tam due to his stature in the Hong Kong en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try – looked fit and did not seem to be 70 from the pho­tos, but they still urged him to be care­ful and not to in­jure him­self.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers said the pho­tos re­minded them of his 1985 song Love Trap, where he was seen rid­ing a speed­boat in the mu­sic video.</p>
    <p>Tam is a well-known fit­ness buff and has posted pho­tos on so­cial me­dia of him­self jog­ging and play­ing bad­minton and foot­ball.</p>
    <p>He sparked a lit­tle scare among his fans last month, when they no­ticed that his face looked thin in one of his pho­tos. He clar­i­fied that it was taken when he was slightly de­hy­drated af­ter a stren­u­ous work­out.</p>
