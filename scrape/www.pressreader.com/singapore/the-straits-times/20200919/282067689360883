    <p>Labour­tel Man­age­ment Corp, a com­pany that runs for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries, was fined $118,000 yes­ter­day af­ter the au­thor­i­ties in­spected four of them and found that some rooms were filthy.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the in­spec­tions in 2018 and last year, two of the fa­cil­i­ties were also found to have prob­lems such as dam­aged lights, faulty lock­ers and a dam­aged toi­let bowl.</p>
    <p>Parvis Ahmed Mo­hamed Ghouse, 43, a direc­tor at Labour­tel at the time of the checks, was fined $59,000 yes­ter­day. One of its of­fi­cers, Shaik Mo­hamed Mo­hamed Ab­dul J a l e e l , 3 4 , wa s fined $22,000.</p>
    <p>Labour­tel Man­age­ment Corp, which is part of prop­erty and lo­gis­tics so­lu­tions com­pany MES Group, and the two Sin­ga­pore­ans pleaded guilty in March to charges un­der the For­eign Em­ployee Dor­mi­to­ries Act.</p>
    <p>They were the first ones to be con­victed un­der the Act, which took ef­fect in Jan­uary 2016.</p>
    <p>Two of the com­pany’s fa­cil­i­ties, Jurong Pen­juru Dor­mi­tory 1 and 2, are lo­cated in Pen­juru Place near West Coast Road.</p>
    <p>The other two are Blue Stars Dor­mi­tory in Kian Teck Lane near Boon Lay Way, and The Leo in Kaki Bukit Road 3.</p>
    <p>Labour­tel, which was con­victed of seven charges, failed to fully com­ply with li­cens­ing con­di­tions and im­prove the dor­mi­to­ries de­spite be­ing ad­vised by the Min­istry of Man­power af­ter ear­lier in­spec­tions.</p>
    <p>As part of the con­di­tions, the li­censee must main­tain clean­li­ness at the dor­mi­to­ries. It must also keep the interior and exterior of all build­ings – such as doors, win­dows and san­i­tary ap­pli­ances – in good con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Jurong Pen­juru Dor­mi­tory 1 was in­spected in May 2018, and 27 rooms were found to be filthy, with greasy cook­ing ar­eas, among other is­sues. Sim­i­lar prob­lems were also found at the three other dor­mi­to­ries in other in­spec­tions later in 2018 and last year.</p>
    <p>Parvis was con­victed of four charges un­der the Act. His role was to over­see the daily op­er­a­tions of Jurong Pen­juru Dor­mi­tory 1 and 2, as well as Blue Stars Dor­mi­tory.</p>
    <p>He was also re­spon­si­ble for the man­power, se­cu­rity, clean­ing, main­te­nance and equip­ment pro­cure­ment for all three fa­cil­i­ties. He had also ne­glected his du­ties to rec­tify the non-com­pli­ance of the li­cens­ing con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Shaik, whose role was to take charge of the sign­ing of ten­ancy agree­ments be­tween Labour­tel and the var­i­ous em­ploy­ers of the for­eign work­ers stay­ing at Jurong Pen­juru Dor­mi­tory 1, pleaded guilty in March to one charge un­der the Act.</p>
    <p>He had breached the li­cens­ing con­di­tions on the per­mit­ted num­ber of oc­cu­pants in the dor­mi­tory.</p>
