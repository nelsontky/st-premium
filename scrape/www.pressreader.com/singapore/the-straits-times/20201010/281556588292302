    <p>China’s Golden Week saw crammed air­ports and crowded tourist at­trac­tions as its peo­ple came out in full strength over the eight-day Na­tional Day hol­i­day. While the rest of the world con­tin­ues to reel from Covid-19, China’s do­mes­tic trips hit 79 per cent of last year’s level in the an­nual travel rush. WORLD</p>
    <p>Trains were packed, tourist at­trac­tions crowded and air­ports crammed – these were the scenes across China dur­ing its just-ended eight-day Na­tional Day hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>They were an un­usual sight in a world gripped by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, where many coun­tries are still record­ing mount­ing in­fec­tions and con­tem­plat­ing re­newed lock­downs.</p>
    <p>But not so in China, which re­ported the first coro­n­avirus case in the world late last year.</p>
    <p>The na­tional Golden Week hol­i­day – which was ex­tended by a day this year be­cause of the Mid-Au­tumn Fes­ti­val – saw 637 mil­lion do­mes­tic trips be­ing made, about 79 per cent of the 782 mil­lion trips made last year, ac­cord­ing to jus­tre­leased fig­ures from the Min­istry of Cul­ture and Tourism.</p>
    <p>The travel rush gen­er­ated 466.56 bil­lion yuan (S$94.3 bil­lion) in tourism rev­enue, about 70 per cent of that gen­er­ated dur­ing last year’s hol­i­day stretch.</p>
    <p>This year’s Golden Week travel rush has been closely watched as a barom­e­ter of China’s eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>While Chi­nese state me­dia ex­tolled the ini­tial fig­ures as ev­i­dence of the coun­try’s ro­bust re­cov­ery, some economists had ex­pected the num­bers to be higher, which sug­gested the pan­demic and the eco­nomic slow­down were still weigh­ing on Chi­nese con­sumers.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cial China Daily said in an edi­to­rial on Thurs­day that while the fig­ure did not match last year’s, it still re­flected a “strong re­cov­ery in con­sumer con­fi­dence” and a “pal­pa­ble wide­spread post-epi­demic feel-good mood”.</p>
    <p>“If this mo­men­tum can be main­tained, the Chi­nese econ­omy – which surged 3.2 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter from the 6.8 per cent fall in the first quar­ter – might re­alise sub­stan­tial pos­i­tive growth this year, de­spite the com­bined blows it has taken from the pan­demic and the US ad­min­is­tra­tion’s con­tain­ment and pro­tec­tion­ist poli­cies,” said the news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>China’s econ­omy is pro­jected to grow 2 per cent this year, the World Bank has es­ti­mated, and is widely ex­pected to be the only ma­jor econ­omy to reg­is­ter pos­i­tive growth.</p>
    <p>In Hubei prov­ince, where the virus was first dis­cov­ered in De­cem­ber, tourists were back out in force, said tour guide Guo Qiang, who told The Straits Times that some pop­u­lar tourist sites ap­peared to have more vis­i­tors af­ter en­try fees were abol­ished to draw in the crowds.</p>
    <p>“I am quite op­ti­mistic about the tourism in­dus­try in Hubei. Tourists now are not wor­ried about the pan­demic any­more be­cause they know it’s very safe in China,” said the 31-year-old, adding that he has a packed month of book­ings.</p>
    <p>In a report re­leased yes­ter­day, the Chi­nese travel ser­vices provider, Trip.com Group, called tourism a “bright spot” in the coun­try’s econ­omy and said the hol­i­day pe­riod had seen a strength­en­ing of con­sumer con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>“We re­main op­ti­mistic about travel and are en­cour­aged by the pace of re­cov­ery in China,” said the group’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Jane Sun.</p>
    <p>Shang­hai-based in­de­pen­dent econ­o­mist Ye Tan said that many Chi­nese used to travel overseas dur­ing the Golden Week pe­riod, but with in­ter­na­tional travel not pos­si­ble now, that de­mand has shifted to the do­mes­tic mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“The out­look from tourism seems pos­i­tive and I think it’s a good sign for con­sump­tion in other ar­eas as we move for­ward,” she said.</p>
    <p>But oth­ers re­mained less san­guine.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal econ­o­mist Hu Xing­dou said the fact that tourism spend­ing did not re­cover to last year’s lev­els showed that Chi­nese con­sumers were still cau­tious about the eco­nomic im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He pointed out that many peo­ple had lost their jobs and fewer con­sumers had enough spend­ing power to travel.</p>
    <p>“For many, if they can main­tain their life­styles, it’s good enough. Travel is a lux­ury for those who are richer,” he added.</p>
