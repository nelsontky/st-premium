    <p>Tough re­stric­tions will be reim­posed in Jakarta from Mon­day, a move an­a­lysts have said is nec­es­sary but may be too lit­tle, too late as the num­ber of Covid-19 cases in the In­done­sian cap­i­tal surges to a record high, push­ing the health­care sys­tem to the brink.</p>
    <p>Some 50,000 res­i­dents have been in­fected so far, and more than 1,300 have died. But these are only con­firmed fig­ures and re­ports speak of ceme­ter­ies run­ning out of space.</p>
    <p>The city’s gov­er­nor, Mr Anies Baswedan, has warned that not a sin­gle iso­la­tion room in a hos­pi­tal will be avail­able by Sept 17 if tough mea­sures are not reim­posed.</p>
    <p>“Jakarta doesn’t have any choice other than pulling the emer­gency brake as soon as pos­si­ble,” he said in a Face­book live-stream video on Wed­nes­day when an­nounc­ing the re­in­state­ment of re­stric­tive mea­sures in the city of more than 10 mil­lion peo­ple. En­ter­tain­ment venues will be shut, restau­rants and cafes will of­fer only de­liv­er­ies and take­aways, and staff in non-es­sen­tial sec­tors will work from home.</p>
    <p>The reim­po­si­tion of re­stric­tions in Jakarta – even if lim­ited – will have ma­jor reper­cus­sions, given the city’s sta­tus as the coun­try’s fi­nan­cial hub and an en­gine of eco­nomic growth. More busi­nesses can be ex­pected to go bust and peo­ple will lose their jobs.</p>
    <p>A re­ces­sion is in­evitable, and the road to re­cov­ery will be long and hard, an­a­lysts told The Straits Times. Most agreed that the cen­tral gov­ern­ment and the city ad­min­is­tra­tion must now en­sure that so­cial as­sis­tance reaches low-in­come groups.</p>
    <p>“There is not much time be­fore Sept 14. The poor and those vul­ner­a­ble to poverty must first be am­ply sup­plied with ba­sic ne­ces­si­ties so they can sur­vive,” said econ­o­mist Bhima Yud­hi­s­tira Ad­hine­gara from the In­sti­tute for De­vel­op­ment of Eco­nomics and Fi­nance.</p>
    <p>Jakarta was the first city to im­pose vol­un­tary large-scale so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures – bet­ter known here by the lo­cal ab­bre­vi­a­tion PSBB – on April 10 af­ter the first Covid-19 cases in the coun­try were de­tected in the cap­i­tal in March.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures were grad­u­ally eased from June 4 af­ter the city ap­peared to have man­aged to flat­ten the curve for new cases. At the time, fa­tal­i­ties stood at 523, and no new deaths were re­ported.</p>
    <p>Work­places, places of wor­ship, shop­ping cen­tres and recre­ational venues were al­lowed to open, with lim­ited ca­pac­ity and safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>But, even then, Mr Anies warned about the pos­si­bil­ity of reim­pos­ing re­stric­tions should there be a spike in cases.</p>
    <p>Then came the much-feared resur­gence of in­fec­tions, which have grown rapidly re­cently.</p>
    <p>One ma­jor rea­son was the pub­lic’s cav­a­lier at­ti­tude to­wards the coro­n­avirus which causes Covid-19. Many ig­nored the rules on mask wear­ing and so­cial dis­tanc­ing. Crowds flocked to malls, mar­kets, parks and tourist spots.</p>
    <p>The lack of man­power and the huge pop­u­la­tion also con­trib­uted to the surge. They made the job of nab­bing those who flout the rules and fin­ing them a chal­leng­ing one. Po­lice and sol­diers, who were mo­bilised to en­force the rules, could be de­ployed only at strate­gic lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, reg­u­la­tory flip-flops on so­cial curbs, work and travel did not help mat­ters. “The eas­ing of re­stric­tions proved to be un­suc­cess­ful and cat­a­strophic for both health and eco­nomic re­cov­ery,” said Mr Bhima.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts said part of the blame also lies with Pres­i­dent Joko</p>
    <p>Wi­dodo and his gov­ern­ment, which has been widely crit­i­cised for ap­par­ently be­ing more con­cerned about the econ­omy than peo­ple’s health and safety.</p>
    <p>Last week, Mr Erick Tho­hir, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the gov­ern­ment’s Re­sponse and Eco­nomic Re­cov­ery Com­mit­tee, of­fered an apol­ogy of sorts.</p>
    <p>“We, the gov­ern­ment, have tried our best and worked hard with all of our short­com­ings, and we apol­o­gise if it is not per­fect,” he said while plead­ing for more co­op­er­a­tion from the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Mr Joko has also ad­mon­ished his min­is­ters for the “lack of sense of cri­sis” and urged re­gional ad­min­is­tra­tions to has­ten bud­get al­lo­ca­tions to bol­ster health and busi­ness sec­tors.</p>
    <p>“It’s too lit­tle, too late, but late is bet­ter than never,” said Dr Fir­man Noor, head of the In­done­sian In­sti­tute of Sciences’ po­lit­i­cal re­search cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Mr Jo­sua Pard­ede, an econ­o­mist with Bank Per­mata, ex­pects the lat­est round of re­stric­tions to be in ef­fect for at least a month to al­low for the re­duc­tion in cases.</p>
    <p>“One les­son we have learnt is that pre­ma­ture eas­ing of re­stric­tions was not do­ing us any favour,” he said. The gov­ern­ment should en­sure dis­ci­pline in the com­mu­nity, he added.</p>
    <p>One ma­jor rea­son (for the resur­gence of in­fec­tions) was the pub­lic’s cav­a­lier at­ti­tude to­wards the coro­n­avirus... Many ig­nored the rules on mask wear­ing and so­cial dis­tanc­ing. Crowds flocked to malls, mar­kets, parks and tourist spots.
