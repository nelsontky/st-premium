    <p>There will in­evitably be more im­ported Covid-19 cases here, but ex­perts say this will not be of great con­cern.</p>
    <p>They noted that more trav­ellers are re­turn­ing dur­ing the fes­tive pe­riod, es­pe­cially since the out­break in some coun­tries is wors­en­ing dur­ing win­ter.</p>
    <p>Case num­bers could rise if bor­der re­stric­tions are eased in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>Im­ported cases have in­creased from sin­gle to dou­ble dig­its in the past two weeks, with 21 new in­fec­tions last Wed­nes­day. The num­ber of peo­ple serv­ing stay-home no­tice (SHN) in ho­tels has also risen in tan­dem.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple tak­ing stay­ca­tions do not need to worry about get­ting in­fected if they book a ho­tel that also serves those on SHN, said Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health.</p>
    <p>“Gen­er­ally, ho­tels host­ing SHN trav­ellers are re­quired to prac­tise cer­tain pro­to­cols, es­pe­cially in en­sur­ing that SHN trav­ellers and hol­i­day­ing guests do not min­gle,” Prof Teo said.</p>
    <p>“This may mean that SHN trav­ellers are housed in a ded­i­cated wing or on ded­i­cated floors.”</p>
    <p>If pro­to­cols are fol­lowed prop­erly, the chance of hol­i­day­ing guests be­ing in­fected by SHN trav­ellers is very small, he added.</p>
    <p>Prof Teo’s re­marks fol­low the re­cent Man­darin Or­chard ho­tel in­ci­dent, where 13 peo­ple were sus­pected to have con­tracted the virus while on SHN.</p>
    <p>“But I ex­pect this like­li­hood to be even much smaller now, since I’m sure the au­thor­i­ties are re­view­ing the pro­to­cols for ho­tels that serve both SHN trav­ellers and holi</p>
