    <p>The In­dian ter­ri­tory of Jammu and Kash­mir is in an eco­nomic crash, with an ad­min­is­tra­tion at a stand­still, af­ter a year of curbs which saw its special au­ton­o­mous sta­tus re­voked and fed­eral rule im­posed.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has made things worse, as Covid-19 re­stric­tions add to lock­downs which have been a fea­ture in the ter­ri­tory for al­most the whole year.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, thou­sands of In­dian troops fanned out across Kash­mir and sur­round­ing vil­lages to im­pose a cur­few – a day be­fore the oneyear an­niver­sary of fed­eral rule.</p>
    <p>This is the lat­est re­stric­tion in the re­gion, which has suf­fered the long­est In­ter­net black­out in any demo­cratic coun­try as well as a raft of al­leged hu­man rights abuses.</p>
    <p>A year ago to­day, In­dia’s Home Min­is­ter di­vided the coun­try’s only Mus­lim-ma­jor­ity state into two fed­eral ter­ri­to­ries and scrapped its special au­ton­omy.</p>
    <p>Many parts of Jammu and Kash­mir re­main un­der lock­down. The Kash­mir Cham­ber of Com­merce and In­dus­try last month es­ti­mated eco­nomic losses in the past year at 400 bil­lion ru­pees (S$7.3 bil­lion), with al­most 100,000 jobs lost.</p>
    <p>Tourism, a main­stay of the econ­omy, has been hit hard. Agricultur­e, hor­ti­cul­ture and trans­port have also suf­fered.</p>
    <p>“What­ever busi­nesses sur­vived the lock­down, the pan­demic has de­stroyed. No­body pur­chases any­thing. Busi­nesses are bankrupted and un­paid bank loans have piled up. Small traders have closed shop,” said Mr Yaseen Khan, pres­i­dent of Kash­mir’s Traders and Man­u­fac­turer’s Fed­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Ram Madhav, the na­tional gen­eral sec­re­tary of the rul­ing Bharatiya Janata Party, at­trib­uted the eco­nomic crash to the Kash­mir Val­ley be­com­ing “in­ac­ces­si­ble dur­ing win­ter”, and the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The ad­min­is­tra­tion is at a stand­still. A Fe­bru­ary gov­ern­ment doc­u­ment shows re­cruit­ment had yet to start for more than 84,000 jobs.</p>
    <p>Kash­mir’s lock­down, un­like those in the pan­demic-struck world, comes with pro­longed curbs on phone and In­ter­net ac­cess.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has slowly ex­panded ac­cess, first to tele­phone calls, then se­lect web­sites and, now, broad­band and 2G mo­bile In­ter­net, but high-speed In­ter­net is still blocked. In May, In­dia’s Supreme Court left the is­sue of restor­ing In­ter­net ac­cess to an ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>Mr G. N. Var, pres­i­dent of the Kash­mir pri­vate schools’ as­so­ci­a­tion, said schools have been shut for over 13 months now. He called it “a lock-up, not a lock­down”.</p>
    <p>“Out­side Kash­mir, schools closed due to Covid-19 can teach on­line. But we are strug­gling to find mod­ern soft­ware and gad­gets that work on 2G In­ter­net. It takes three hours to up­load and down­load a les­son. Our chil­dren are de­pressed and re­ally fall­ing be­hind. It’s cre­at­ing an ir­repara­ble ed­u­ca­tion gap,” he said.</p>
    <p>The drawn-out In­ter­net curbs have dev­as­tated health­care too. Pa­tients un­der lock­down can­not send doc­tors their med­i­cal re­ports and health­care work­ers can­not at­tend on­line meet­ings.</p>
    <p>On July 29, the gov­ern­ment ex­tended the re­stric­tions on 4G In­ter­net to Aug 19, cit­ing its misuse in ter­ror ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>A July re­port by aca­demics, for­mer judges, bu­reau­crats and mil­i­tary of­fi­cers said the 11 months of lock­down had seen an “across-the­board vi­o­la­tion of hu­man rights”.</p>
    <p>Since last Au­gust, the au­thor­i­ties have ar­rested thou­sands of peo­ple, in­clud­ing all the state’s lead­ing politi­cians. As of March, 437 peo­ple were still de­tained un­der the state’s Public Safety Act, which al­lows pre­ven­tive de­ten­tion with­out charge or trial for up to two years.</p>
    <p>Jour­nal­ists in Kash­mir say they face in­creased hos­til­ity and pres­sure. The Ed­i­tors Guild of In­dia has de­scribed the use of an anti-ter­ror law against two jour­nal­ists as a “misuse of power” meant “to strike ter­ror into jour­nal­ists”.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties jus­tify the re­stric­tions as nec­es­sary for na­tional se­cu­rity. They say the num­ber of lo­cals re­cruited by armed groups has fallen by 48 per cent from the pre­vi­ous year, and that mil­i­tancy in South Kash­mir has al­most ended. A se­nior po­lice of­fi­cial has said that 118 mil­i­tants were killed be­tween Jan­uary and June.</p>
    <p>But se­cu­rity ex­perts point to Kash­mir’s his­tory of up­heavals af­ter se­vere mil­i­tary crack­downs.</p>
    <p>Some of the young men killed re­cently had joined mil­i­tant groups only this year. For­mer po­lice chief A. M. Watali warned that re­cruit­ment could ac­tu­ally rise un­der the fury over In­dian rule and con­cerns about forced cul­tural change.</p>
    <p>These con­cerns are am­pli­fied by new domi­cile rules an­nounced in May, amid the pan­demic. The rules al­low more peo­ple re­garded as out­siders, who did not qual­ify to buy land in Kash­mir for al­most a cen­tury, to do so.</p>
    <p>More than 370,000 peo­ple got domi­cile cer­tifi­cates in a month, in­clud­ing those who have stud­ied or lived in the re­gion for some years. Many Kash­miri Mus­lims fear an in­flux of peo­ple from out­side the re­gion could de­prive them of prop­erty, ed­u­ca­tion and em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the bor­der face-off be­tween In­dia and China in parts of Ladakh, the sec­ond dis­tinct ter­ri­tory carved out of Jammu and Kash­mir state, is un­re­solved, rais­ing geopo­lit­i­cal stakes in the re­gion.</p>
