    <p>Ja­panese busi­ness sen­ti­ment im­proved for the sec­ond straight quar­ter in the Oc­to­berDe­cem­ber pe­riod, a key cen­tral bank sur­vey showed yesterday, a wel­come sign for Ja­pan’s econ­omy as it con­tin­ued to emerge from the ini­tial hit of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But com­pa­nies slashed their cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­ture plans for the year end­ing in March, as a re­cent resur­gence of in­fec­tions re­in­forced ex­pec­ta­tions that any re­cov­ery in the world’s third­largest econ­omy will be frag­ile.</p>
    <p>The head­line in­dex for big manufactur­ers’ sen­ti­ment im­proved to mi­nus 10 this month, from mi­nus 27 in Septem­ber, the Bank of Ja­pan’s (BOJ) closely watched “tankan” sur­vey showed. It com­pared with a me­dian mar­ket fore­cast for a read­ing of mi­nus 15.</p>
    <p>Big non-manufactur­ers’ sen­ti­ment also re­cov­ered to mi­nus 5 from mi­nus 12 in Septem­ber, roughly match­ing a Reuters poll of mi­nus 6, the sur­vey showed.</p>
    <p>Big firms plan to cut their cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­ture by 1.2 per cent in the cur­rent busi­ness year to March next year, a sign that slump­ing prof­its and un­cer­tain­ties over the out­look were dis­cour­ag­ing firms to ramp up spend­ing.</p>
    <p>It was a down­grade from their plan to raise cap­i­tal spend­ing by 1.4 per cent made in the Septem­ber sur­vey and com­pared with mar­ket fore­casts for a 0.2 per cent cut in ex­pen­di­ture.</p>
    <p>The data will be among key fac­tors the BOJ will scru­ti­nise at its two-day rate re­view end­ing on Fri­day. The cen­tral bank is set to hold off on ex­pand­ing stim­u­lus, but will con­sider ex­tend­ing a range of steps aimed at eas­ing cor­po­rate fund­ing strains be­yond their March deadlines.</p>
    <p>Af­ter suf­fer­ing its worst post­war con­trac­tion in the sec­ond quar­ter, Ja­pan’s econ­omy re­bounded in the third quar­ter, helped by im­proved ex­ports and con­sump­tion. But many an­a­lysts ex­pect a third wave of Covid-19 in­fec­tions to keep any re­cov­ery mod­est.</p>
