    <p>I’ll re­mem­ber 2020 as the year my Fomo went away.</p>
    <p>The Fear of Miss­ing Out, that anx­ious be­lief that oth­ers are lead­ing more in­ter­est­ing and mean­ing­ful lives than you are, had plagued me in univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Every event or gath­er­ing seemed to brim with pos­si­bil­ity – and every time I said “no” to some­thing, it seemed like doors were clos­ing.</p>
    <p>Free time be­came some­thing to be max­imised, and va­ca­tions felt al­most like work – a whirl­wind of in­tern­ships, side projects and Tri­pad­vi­sor-rec­om­mended hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>But this year, some­where be­tween the Covid-19 cir­cuit breaker and the weeks I spent gal­li­vant­ing through the South­ern Is­lands (like so many other travel-starved Sin­ga­pore­ans), the anx­i­ety of “miss­ing out” waned.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a pan­demic, after all, there are more im­por­tant things to worry about, and I’ve also come to see that it’s the sim­ple things in life – friend­ship, fam­ily and health, for ex­am­ple – that mat­ter most.</p>
    <p>In­creas­ingly, in­stead of spend­ing my time do­ing some­thing pro­duc­tive, I find it is per­fectly okay to curl up with a book at home and un­wind.</p>
    <p>The acro­nym Fomo was added to the Ox­ford Dic­tionar­ies in 2013. Since then, the con­cept has spawned count­less ar­ti­cles, which of­ten ap­pear with a stock im­age of a woman star­ing at a lap­top, her face il­lu­mi­nated by the screen as she scrolls through so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, how­ever, Fomo’s smi­ley twin, the Joy of Miss­ing Out, has also been gain­ing trac­tion.</p>
    <p>It might seem per­verse to talk about Jomo in the mid­dle of Covid-19, where peo­ple the world over have been miss­ing out on plenty of things, nei­ther par­tic­u­larly will­ingly nor joy­fully.</p>
    <p>But there is also some­thing (for want of a bet­ter word) em­pow­er­ing about Jomo, which is about fig­ur­ing out what you want in life and hap­pily “miss­ing out” on the things that do not ful­fil th­ese goals.</p>
    <p>If Fomo is linked to the pas­sive con­sump­tion of so­cial me­dia and the com­pul­sion to com­pare your­self to oth­ers, then Jomo is about be­ing con­scious about what adds value to your life – and dis­re­gard­ing the rest.</p>
    <p>Dan­ish psy­chol­ogy pro­fes­sor Svend Brinkmann makes a sim­i­lar point in his book, The Joy Of Miss­ing Out, which was trans­lated into English last year.</p>
    <p>“I also found in­spi­ra­tion in the idea of ‘one part’, of mak­ing your small part of the world whole, some­thing that is only pos­si­ble if you ‘don’t want it all’,” Pro­fes­sor Brinkmann writes.</p>
    <p>“If you do want it all, life de­scends into a dif­fuse and form­less mass and is any­thing but whole... If your life takes a cer­tain form, it fol­lows log­i­cally that it can­not take myr­iad oth­ers – you miss out on them.”</p>
    <p>He makes a case for a “cul­tural ecol­ogy with aes­thet­i­cally ap­peal­ing rit­u­als that al­low for an eth­i­cally based form of life”, cit­ing the Ja­panese tea cer­e­mony as an ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>Would so­ci­ety be a bet­ter place if we were less ob­sessed with nov­elty, con­sump­tion and chas­ing after the big mo­ments, and more con­tent with what we al­ready have, more will­ing to slow down and savour the beauty of small things?</p>
    <p>It doesn’t take long for thrills to wear off, after all. There is what psy­chol­o­gists call the he­do­nic tread­mill – the the­ory that we tend to re­turn to a fairly sta­ble base­line level of hap­pi­ness, de­spite ma­jor pos­i­tive or neg­a­tive life events.</p>
    <p>A sim­i­lar idea was raised nearly a cen­tury ago in philoso­pher Ber­trand Rus­sell’s The Con­quest Of Hap­pi­ness (1930), where he com­pared the vig­or­ous pur­suit of ex­cite­ment to a drug ad­dict seek­ing ever-greater doses of stim­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the hunt for the next great ad­ven­ture should be tem­pered with a pa­tient – and, ar­guably, less ex­haust­ing – at­tempt to ap­pre­ci­ate life’s sim­ple joys.</p>
    <p>Our choices de­fine us, but so do the things we choose to leave out. I think of the late artist Kim Lim, whose min­i­mal­ist works are de­fined by what is there, as well as what isn’t.</p>
    <p>“Space, light and in­ter­vals to me,” she noted, “are as im­por­tant as form, struc­ture and vol­ume in the lan­guage of sculp­ture.”</p>
    <p>To re­mind my­self that my days are num­bered – and to pri­ori­tise what mat­ters – I have a Life Cal­en­dar, an A3 grid filled with tiny boxes each rep­re­sent­ing a week in a rea­son­ably long life.</p>
    <p>I stum­bled on it a few years ago when I was brows­ing through Wait But Why, a pop­u­lar blog by Amer­i­can writer Tim Ur­ban, and in a burst of en­thu­si­asm printed it out and hung it up, cross­ing out the weeks as they came and went.</p>
    <p>There will al­ways be a part of me that longs to have it all, and that – op­ti­misti­cally, fool­ishly – still be­lieves there will be time to cram in that ex­tra pro­ject or out­ing into my sched­ule, read all the books I want and learn all the lan­guages and skills I would like to.</p>
    <p>But a life­time isn’t long enough for all the things we’d like to ac­com­plish, and per­haps all we can do, re­ally, is pri­ori­tise what mat­ters most.</p>
    <p>Th­ese days, I am hap­pi­est when I find joy in lit­tle things, such as long walks, pleas­ant con­ver­sa­tion and ob­serv­ing the way the light falls on rain­trees dur­ing the golden hour.</p>
    <p>When the late-mod­ernist poet James Mer­rill was dy­ing of com­pli­ca­tions from Aids (ac­quired im­mune de­fi­ciency syn­drome), he wrote a poem, Days Of 1994, that ended with a list of seem­ingly mun­dane things:</p>
    <p>Would so­ci­ety be a bet­ter place if we were less ob­sessed with nov­elty, con­sump­tion and chas­ing after the big mo­ments, and more con­tent with what we al­ready have, more will­ing to slow down and savour the beauty of small things? It doesn’t take long for thrills to wear off, after all.</p>
    <p>The spec­ta­cles, the book, For­get­ful lover and for­got­ten love, Cob­web hung with tro­phy wings, The fad­ing trum­pet of a car,</p>
    <p>The know­ing glance from star to</p>
    <p>star,</p>
    <p>The laugh­ter of old friends.</p>
    <p>I’d wa­ger that what brings us the most com­fort at the end of our lives won’t be grandiose achieve­ments or our mem­o­ries of bungee jump­ing, or back­pack­ing across Europe.</p>
    <p>Rather we will, if we are lucky, rest well in the knowl­edge that we were once truly known by oth­ers, and loved in spite of it.</p>
