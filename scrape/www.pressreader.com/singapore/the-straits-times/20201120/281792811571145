    <p>•</p>
    <p>GENEVA The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s (WHO) emer­gen­cies di­rec­tor warned that vac­cines would not ar­rive in time to de­feat the sec­ond wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
    <p>The WHO’s Dr Michael Ryan said on Wed­nes­day that vac­cines should not be seen as a “uni­corn” magic so­lu­tion – and coun­tries bat­tling a resur­gence of the virus would once again have to “climb this moun­tain” with­out them.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s at least four to six months be­fore we have sig­nif­i­cant lev­els of vac­ci­na­tion going on any­where,” he said, during a pub­lic ques­tion-and-an­swer ses­sion live on social media.</p>
    <p>De­spite re­cent promis­ing an­nounce­ments from fi­nal-phase can­di­date vac­cine tri­als, “we’re not there with vac­cines yet”, said Dr Ryan. “Many coun­tries are going through this wave, and they’re going to go through this wave, and con­tinue through this wave, with­out vac­cines.</p>
    <p>“We need to un­der­stand and in</p>
    <p>Num­ber of Covid-19 cases reg­is­tered world­wide since the out­break emerged in China last De­cem­ber, with more than 1.3 mil­lion peo­ple killed. ter­nalise that, and re­alise: We have got to climb this moun­tain this time, with­out vac­cines.”</p>
    <p>Pfizer said on Wed­nes­day that a com­pleted study of its ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cine showed it was 95 per cent ef­fec­tive, while fel­low United States firm Moderna said this week that its own can­di­date was 94.5 per cent ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia claims its can­di­date is more than 90 per cent ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>Dr Ryan warned against slack­en­ing off in­di­vid­ual vig­i­lance against the virus in the mis­taken be­lief that vac­cines would now solve the prob­lem in­stead.</p>
    <p>“Some peo­ple think a vac­cine will be, in a sense, the so­lu­tion: the uni­corn we’ve all been chas­ing. It’s not,” the Ir­ish­man said. “If we add vac­cines and for­get the other things, Covid does not go to zero.”</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new Covid-19 cases in Europe de­clined last week for the first time in over three months, but deaths in the re­gion con­tin­ued to climb, WHO data showed on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>While at least 55.6 mil­lion cases world­wide have been reg­is­tered since the out­break emerged in China last De­cem­ber, the coro­n­avirus has killed more than 1.3 mil­lion peo­ple around the globe, ac­cord­ing to a tally from of­fi­cial sources com­piled by Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>Dr Ryan voiced concerns about how the pandemic has left many be­reaved grand­chil­dren who have been un­able to go through the nor­mal griev­ing process due to the re­stric­tions im­posed to com­bat the virus.</p>
    <p>“A lot of kids in this have lost grand­par­ents,” he said. “There’s quite a bit of trauma out there amongst kids. The griev­ing process for kids – it’s tough, be­cause you don’t have all the nat­u­ral things: the fu­neral sit­u­a­tion, you don’t get to say good­bye, you don’t have the gath­er­ings, so it’s griev­ing in­ter­rupted.</p>
    <p>“I am con­cerned if the child’s need to grieve the loss of a grand­par­ent has been in­ter­rupted, be­cause that has a life­long im­pact.”</p>
    <p>NOT THERE YET</p>
    <p>I think it’s at least four to six months be­fore we have sig­nif­i­cant lev­els of vac­ci­na­tion going on any­where... We need to un­der­stand and in­ter­nalise that, and re­alise: We have got to climb this moun­tain this time, with­out vac­cines.</p>
