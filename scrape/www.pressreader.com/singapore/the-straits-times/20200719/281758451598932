    <p>Crim­i­nals more than dou­bled their at­tempts last year to hack into me­dia web­sites here to ac­cess per­sonal and fi­nan­cial de­tails of users, a new study has re­ported.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, Sin­ga­pore’s me­dia sites were hit so of­ten by “cre­den­tial stuff­ing” at­tacks that it ranked 8th out of more than 130 coun­tries sur­veyed by cy­ber security firm Aka­mai.</p>
    <p>More than 137 mil­lion of such ma­li­cious log-in at­tempts were made on me­dia sites last year – a huge spike from the 56 mil­lion at­tempts in 2018, ac­cord­ing to the Cre­den­tial Stuff­ing In The Me­dia In­dus­try re­port pub­lished last week.</p>
    <p>Cre­den­tial stuff­ing is the use of user lo­gin de­tails stolen from one ser­vice or site, to log in to other un­re­lated sites in or­der to col­lect sen­si­tive data such as credit card num­bers and per­sonal data that can be used in other at­tacks or scams.</p>
    <p>Hack­ers use bots to run lo­gin de­tails of users they ob­tain in large batches from places like the Dark Web, which is the black mar­ket of the In­ter­net. Me­dia sites like video stream­ing plat­forms, so­cial me­dia net­works and on­line news por­tals were choice tar­gets in such at­tacks.</p>
    <p>“Con­sumers’ ac­counts that con­tain per­sonal and fi­nan­cial in­for­ma­tion are of par­tic­u­lar in­ter­est to at­tack­ers,” said Mr Sid­dharth Desh­pande, di­rec­tor of security strat­egy at Aka­mai Tech­nolo­gies, on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“The me­dia in­dus­try is one of the big­gest tar­gets of cre­den­tial stuff</p>
    <p>PRIZED TAR­GET</p>
    <p>The me­dia in­dus­try is a prized tar­get for crim­i­nals who are look­ing to trade in stolen in­for­ma­tion and ac­cess. These ac­counts are sold in bulk and the goal for the crim­i­nals is to move their goods by vol­ume, rather than sin­gle ac­count sales. ’’</p>
    <p>MR SID­DHARTH DESH­PANDE, di­rec­tor of security strat­egy at Aka­mai Tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>ing at­tacks, where cy­ber crim­i­nals re­alise the value of an ac­count – whether it’s to a stream­ing site, a game or some­one’s so­cial me­dia ac­count,” he added.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts The Sun­day Times spoke to said Sin­ga­pore’s well-con­nected na­ture made it a nat­u­ral tar­get for cre­den­tial stuff­ing at­tacks.</p>
    <p>“The year-on-year per­cent­age change as re­ported by Aka­mai and the change of 142 per cent for Sin­ga­pore is not a sur­prise as the coun­try is a highly con­nected node and has an ex­tremely high level of In­ter­net us­age in­clud­ing mo­bile tele­phone own­er­ship among the cit­i­zenry,” said Mr K.K. Lim, head of cy­ber security, pri­vacy and data pro­tec­tion at law firm Harry Elias Part­ner­ship.</p>
    <p>Mr Bryan Tan, a lawyer spe­cial­is­ing in tech­nol­ogy law and data pro­tec­tion at Pin­sent Ma­sons MPil­lay, added that Sin­ga­pore likely has a high sub­scriber­ship to on­line me­dia, which makes it an at­trac­tive tar­get to hack­ers.</p>
    <p>Aka­mai’s research found that the cre­den­tials that hack­ers pur­chase to use when at­tempt­ing to log in to me­dia ac­counts are sold in bulk, which means that hack­ers can eas­ily get their hands on such data.</p>
    <p>This, cou­pled with the rapid growth of me­dia con­sump­tion, is what makes the sec­tor such an at­trac­tive tar­get to hack­ers, said Mr Desh­pande, who added that Aka­mai has no­ticed a 30 per cent surge in In­ter­net traf­fic glob­ally this year.</p>
    <p>“The me­dia in­dus­try is a prized tar­get for crim­i­nals who are look­ing to trade in stolen in­for­ma­tion and ac­cess. These ac­counts are sold in bulk and the goal for the crim­i­nals is to move their goods by vol­ume, rather than sin­gle ac­count sales,” he said.</p>
    <p>Users of me­dia ac­counts might al­ready have fallen vic­tim to such hack­ers with­out know­ing it, said Mr Tan, who ad­vised users to be vig­i­lant if they get mes­sages that their ac­counts are be­ing ac­cessed from places or par­ties not fa­mil­iar to them.</p>
    <p>“The loss, how­ever, is on the me­dia in­dus­try’s part in the form of lost in­come as well as higher cost to stream the me­dia where the lo­gin was ma­li­cious. It would be in the me­dia in­dus­try’s di­rect in­ter­est to take the steps to beef up their cy­ber security,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim ad­vised that users should use two-fac­tor au­then­ti­ca­tion where it is of­fered. It pro­vides an ad­di­tional layer of security by re­quir­ing users to key in a code that is ei­ther sent to their mo­bile phones or gen­er­ated by a to­ken.</p>
