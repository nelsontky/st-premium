    <p>PHILADEL­PHIA • For­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama re­turned to the cam­paign trail on Wed­nes­day, launch­ing a blis­ter­ing attack on Mr Don­ald Trump with less than two weeks to go be­fore the Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent’s face-off with Demo­cratic nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at a drive-in rally in Philadel­phia on be­half of Mr Bi­den, his for­mer vice-pres­i­dent, Mr Obama of­fered his fiercest cri­tique yet of his suc­ces­sor, tak­ing aim at Mr Trump’s di­vi­sive rhetoric and his track record in the Oval Of­fice.</p>
    <p>“He hasn’t shown any in­ter­est in do­ing the work or help­ing any­body but him­self,” Mr Obama said.</p>
    <p>Mr Obama, who gov­erned for two terms and re­mains one of the most pop­u­lar fig­ures in the Demo­cratic Party, blasted Mr Trump for his han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, not­ing that the Pres­i­dent him­self had fallen vic­tim to the virus.</p>
    <p>“Don­ald Trump isn’t sud­denly go­ing to pro­tect all of us,” he said. “He can’t even take the ba­sic steps to pro­tect him­self.”</p>
    <p>Mr Obama’s ap­pear­ance filled a gap left by Mr Bi­den, who has stayed at home in Delaware since Mon­day for meet­ings and prepa­ra­tion ahead of his fi­nal de­bate with Mr Trump in Nashville, Ten­nessee, on Thurs­day evening (9am today Sin­ga­pore time).</p>
    <p>With a re­cent Reuters/Ip­sos poll show­ing Mr Bi­den with just a 4 per­cent­age point edge in bat­tle­ground state Penn­syl­va­nia, Mr Obama warned Democrats against com­pla­cency.</p>
    <p>“We’ve got to turn out like never be­fore,” he said. “We can­not leave any doubt in this elec­tion.”</p>
    <p>Four years ago, Mr Obama par­tic­i­pated in a rally in Philadel­phia with then-Demo­cratic nom­i­nee Hil­lary Clin­ton the day be­fore the elec­tion, only to see Mr Trump nar­rowly take the state.</p>
    <p>The Bi­den cam­paign con­sid­ers winning there a top pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­cans are vot­ing early at a record pace this year, with 42 mil­lion bal­lots cast both via mail and in per­son ahead of the Nov 3 elec­tion on con­cerns about the coro­n­avirus and to make sure their votes are counted.</p>
    <p>The record early vote so far rep­re­sents about 30 per cent of the to­tal bal­lots cast in 2016, ac­cord­ing to the Univer­sity of Florida’s US Elec­tions Project.</p>
    <p>After Mr Obama spoke, Mr Trump held a rally in North Carolina, an­other bat­tle­ground state where opin­ion polls show a tight race.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s run­ning mate, Ms Ka­mala Harris, was also in North Carolina to mo­bilise vot­ers in Asheville and Char­lotte.</p>
    <p>Even though Wed­nes­day marked Mr Obama’s 2020 cam­paign de­but, his sup­port has been es­sen­tial for Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>He has ap­peared at joint fundrais­ers with Mr Bi­den and Ms Harris, and his net­work of well-con­nected for­mer aides has been in­stru­men­tal in help­ing the cam­paign out­pace Mr Trump in bring­ing in do­na­tions.</p>
    <p>The Bi­den cam­paign is hope­ful that Mr Obama will com­mit to more events be­fore the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The last days of cam­paign­ing are tak­ing place amid a surge in new cases of Covid-19 and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions in bat­tle­ground states, in­clud­ing North Carolina and Penn­syl­va­nia, as well as Wis­con­sin, Ohio and Michi­gan.</p>
    <p>Penn­syl­va­nia has av­er­aged 1,500 new cases a day over the past week, a level it has not seen since April, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters anal­y­sis. North Carolina is av­er­ag­ing 2,000 new cases a day over the past week, its high­est level ever.</p>
    <p>The virus has claimed the lives of more than 221,000 peo­ple in the United States, with cases to­talling over 8.5 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Polling shows a ma­jor­ity of vot­ers are dis­ap­pointed in the way Mr Trump has han­dled the pan­demic, which he has re­peat­edly said would dis­ap­pear on its own.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den and Mr Trump are sched­uled to meet in their fi­nal de­bate, giv­ing the Repub­li­can an op­por­tu­nity to change the tra­jec­tory of a race that sees Mr Bi­den lead­ing in na­tional polls.</p>
    <p>NO IN­TER­EST IN DO­ING THE WORK He hasn’t shown any in­ter­est in do­ing the work or help­ing any­body but him­self. FOR­MER PRES­I­DENT BARACK OBAMA, on US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>CAN’T EVEN PRO­TECT HIM­SELF Don­ald Trump isn’t sud­denly go­ing to pro­tect all of us. He can’t even take the ba­sic steps to pro­tect him­self. MR OBAMA, on Mr Trump catch­ing the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>NOT A REAL­ITY SHOW This is not a real­ity show. This is real­ity. MR OBAMA, ques­tion­ing Mr Trump’s abil­ity to take his job se­ri­ously.</p>
