    <p>Many Euro­pean coun­tries have tight­ened mea­sures to fight Covid-19 af­ter a brief re­lax­ation over the Christ­mas and New Year pe­riod.</p>
    <p>They have re-im­posed lock­downs, closed shops and of­fices and in­tro­duced laws to make it eas­ier for gov­ern­ments to im­pose fur­ther re­stric­tions to bat­tle the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain re­ported 1,325 coron­avirus-re­lated fa­tal­i­ties on Fri­day – the high­est ever daily in­crease in deaths – as it recorded another 68,053 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son an­nounced last Mon­day that a lock­down will be im­posed be­cause a new vari­ant of the virus was spread­ing in the coun­try in a frus­trat­ing and alarm­ing way. The lock­down took ef­fect on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Lon­don Mayor Sadiq Khan also de­clared a “ma­jor in­ci­dent” on Fri­day, warn­ing that hos­pi­tals in the city were close to be­ing over­run.</p>
    <p>Mr Khan said in a state­ment: “The num­ber of cases in Lon­don has in­creased rapidly with more than a third more pa­tients be­ing treated in our hos­pi­tals now com­pared with the peak of the pan­demic last April.</p>
    <p>“If we do not take im­me­di­ate ac­tion now, our Na­tional Health Ser­vice could be over­whelmed and more people will die.”</p>
    <p>Ger­many on Fri­day re­ported its high­est daily death toll of the pan­demic, with 1,188 fa­tal­i­ties recorded in 24 hours. The pre­vi­ous record was 1,129 on Dec 30.</p>
    <p>Here are some of the re­stric­tions im­posed by coun­tries in Europe to fight the pan­demic at the start of this year:</p>
    <p>BRI­TAIN</p>
    <p>Bri­tain has im­posed a na­tional lock­down that took ef­fect last Tues­day and can last un­til March 31.</p>
    <p>Col­leges and pri­mary and sec­ondary schools re­main closed for face-to-face learn­ing ex­cept to the chil­dren of key work­ers and vul­ner­a­ble stu­dents. Univer­sity stu­dents will not be re­turn­ing un­til at least the mid­dle of next month.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ees have been told to work from home, and leave home only for es­sen­tial trips.</p>
    <p>All non-es­sen­tial shops and per­sonal care ser­vices, such as hair­dressers, will be closed and restau­rants can of­fer only take­away ser­vices.</p>
    <p>GER­MANY</p>
    <p>Europe’s largest econ­omy is ex­tend­ing its na­tion­wide lock­down un­til Jan 31.</p>
    <p>New rules will for the first time re­strict non-es­sen­tial travel for res­i­dents of hard-hit ar­eas all over Ger­many.</p>
    <p>The rules limit move­ment in towns and districts where the num­ber of new Covid-19 cases is above 200 per 100,000 res­i­dents over a seven-day pe­riod.</p>
    <p>They also in­clude a limit on gath­er­ings, with mem­bers of any one house­hold be­ing al­lowed to meet only one other per­son.</p>
    <p>Shops and restau­rants will re­main shut un­til Jan 31.</p>
    <p>FRANCE</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Olivier Veran told lo­cal me­dia last week that the govern­ment is not rul­ing out another lock­down af­ter the pre­vi­ous one was re­placed with a na­tion­wide 8pm to 6am cur­few on Dec 15.</p>
    <p>Any­one break­ing cur­few is li­able for a €135 (S$219) fine.</p>
    <p>Restau­rants, bars, night­clubs, and public places such as cin­e­mas and the­atres re­main closed.</p>
    <p>THE NETHER­LANDS</p>
    <p>The coun­try closed bars and restau­rants in mid-Oc­to­ber, and non-es­sen­tial shops and busi­nesses, gyms, mu­se­ums, cin­e­mas and the­atres were shut from Dec 15. The Dutch have been ad­vised to stay home and they may have a max­i­mum of only two guests a day.</p>
    <p>POLAND</p>
    <p>Public gath­er­ings in Poland are limited to five people.</p>
    <p>The East­ern Euro­pean coun­try in­tro­duced a three-week strict lock­down on Dec 28, with the clo­sure of non-es­sen­tial shops and all ar­rivals from abroad re­quired to iso­late for 10 days.</p>
    <p>HUN­GARY</p>
    <p>All shops in Hun­gary re­main open, but the coun­try’s bor­ders are closed to al­most all vis­i­tors, in­clud­ing cit­i­zens of other Euro­pean Union na­tions. A night-time cur­few is in force be­tween 8pm and 5am.</p>
    <p>SPAIN</p>
    <p>Of the re­gional re­stric­tions im­posed in Spain, Cat­alo­nia has some of the strictest: Since last Thurs­day, people have been barred from leav­ing their mu­nic­i­pal­ity, gyms and shop­ping cen­tres have been closed and only es­sen­tial shops may stay open on week­ends.</p>
    <p>Bars and restau­rants can open for break­fast and lunch, but of­fer only take­aways for din­ner.</p>
    <p>Madrid, where the 14-day case rate is among the coun­try’s high­est, has re­jected clos­ing restau­rants or non-es­sen­tial shops – in­stead it has opted for a light-touch con­fine­ment of districts with a higher in­fec­tion rate.</p>
    <p>ITALY</p>
    <p>The coun­try will ex­tend most of the coron­avirus re­stric­tions im­posed dur­ing the Christ­mas hol­i­day sea­son un­til this Fri­day. The govern­ment last Tues­day ap­proved a de­cree-law that pro­hibits travel be­tween the coun­try’s re­gions ex­cept for health or work rea­sons.</p>
    <p>People who live in ar­eas hit the hard­est by Covid-19 will be per­mit­ted to “move” just once a day to another sin­gle pri­vate home in their mu­nic­i­pal­ity and there must not be more than two adults per group.</p>
    <p>Bars and restau­rants will pro­vide only take­away ser­vices.</p>
    <p>A na­tion­wide 10pm to 5am cur­few re­mains and sec­ondary schools, capped at a ca­pac­ity of 50 per cent, are yet to re­open. Stu­dents who are to stay home will learn re­motely.</p>
    <p>SWE­DEN</p>
    <p>Last month, Swe­den banned bars and restau­rants from serv­ing al­co­hol af­ter 8pm, limited groups in restau­rants to four and or­dered shops and gyms to set a max­i­mum num­ber of cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents aged 16 and above are to at­tend classes on­line and non-es­sen­tial public ser­vices, such as swim­ming pools and li­braries, re­main closed. Face masks are rec­om­mended on public trans­port at busy times. A new law aimed at mak­ing it eas­ier for the govern­ment to im­pose fur­ther re­stric­tions should come into force to­day.</p>
    <p>NORWAY</p>
    <p>A na­tion­wide ban on serv­ing al­co­hol in restau­rants and bars and on invit­ing guests home is in place fol­low­ing Prime Min­is­ter Erna Sol­berg’s an­nounce­ment last week.</p>
    <p>Be­fore that, the govern­ment an­nounced that univer­sity lec­tures had been sus­pended and told stu­dents to stay home.</p>
    <p>Shops, kinder­gartens and el­e­men­tary schools will re­main open.</p>
    <p>Mid­dle schools and high schools will also re­main open, but will in­ten­sify use of re­mote learn­ing.</p>
    <p>On Dec 31, Oslo im­posed manda­tory Covid-19 tests for all people en­ter­ing Norway from abroad, ei­ther upon ar­rival or within 24 hours.</p>

Schools were also closed for face-to-face learn&#xAD;ing, ex&#xAD;cept to the chil&#xAD;dren of key work&#xAD;ers and vul&#xAD;ner&#xAD;a&#xAD;ble stu&#xAD;dents, and em&#xAD;ploy&#xAD;ees have been told to work from home.</p>
