    <p>Peo­ple keen on a ca­reer change will get help to up­skill from cour­ses co-de­liv­ered by the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity and eight com­pa­nies. Tar­geted at pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers and ex­ec­u­tives, the ini­tia­tive will equip them with skills to en­able them to switch to new ca­reers and roles, and meet the needs of small and medium-sized en­ter­prises.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity (SMU) is link­ing up with eight com­pa­nies to co-de­liver cour­ses that will help up­skill peo­ple keen to make a ca­reer change.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive un­der the SGUnited Skills pro­gramme is tar­geted at pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers and ex­ec­u­tives (PMEs), and aims to meet the needs of small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) in par­tic­u­lar.</p>
    <p>It will equip them with busi­ness man­age­ment, dig­i­tal and in­ter­na­tion­al­i­sa­tion skills to en­able them to switch to new ca­reers and roles.</p>
    <p>The eight firms will pro­vide projects, men­tor­ship and po­ten­tial job op­por­tu­ni­ties for trainees.</p>
    <p>Some of the top­ics to be cov­ered in train­ing in­clude busi­ness and en­vi­ron­men­tal sus­tain­abil­ity, in­no­va­tion and dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Trainees will at­tend classes at SMU for six months, and then get hands-on train­ing at the com­pa­nies for an­other three months.</p>
    <p>A me­moran­dum of un­der­stand­ing was signed be­tween the univer­sity, the eight com­pa­nies and Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore (SSG) at a fo­rum yes­ter­day that fo­cused on how busi­nesses and the work­force can be re­shaped amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The event, which was or­gan­ised by SSG and sup­ported by The Busi­ness Times and The Straits Times, was held in a hy­brid for­mat, with a num­ber of par­tic­i­pants at the Life­long Learn­ing In­sti­tute in Paya Le­bar, while oth­ers at­tended via tele­con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The SGUnited Skills pro­gramme, which is tai­lored for peo­ple look­ing to up­grade their skills while job hunt­ing, is a full-time one rang­ing from six to 12 months.</p>
    <p>Course fees are heav­ily sub­sidised, with trainees also re­ceiv­ing a monthly al­lowance of $1,200 for the du­ra­tion of the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>SSG said about 1,300 peo­ple have signed up for cour­ses un­der the SGUnited Skills pro­gramme, with over 5,000 places still avail­able across more than 100 cour­ses.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said at the fo­rum: “We want to tar­get groups that are more vul­ner­a­ble, that need our help, need that six to 12 months re-tool­ing at this stage of their ca­reer, in this cur­rent sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“Mid-ca­reer, ma­ture PMETs are one of the most vul­ner­a­ble groups. The com­ing months will not be smooth sail­ing. Work­ers and com­pa­nies will need to ad­just, adapt, build new ca­pa­bil­i­ties and seek out new op­por­tu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>Ms Novelle Lim, deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive of Thong Siek Food In­dus­try, one of the eight firms in the SMU pro­gramme, said her com­pany is look­ing into dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing and data an­a­lyt­ics.</p>
    <p>“The pro­gramme cov­ers a lot, mainly on dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies – ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, e-com­merce, dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing and data an­a­lyt­ics. I think it is very pow­er­ful,” she said.</p>
    <p>Min­ing and trad­ing firm Top In­ter­na­tional Hold­ing hopes the pro­gramme will pave the way for more mid-ca­reer work­ers to join its rel­a­tively young team.</p>
    <p>Its chief ex­ec­u­tive Vic­tor Tan said: “The av­er­age age of em­ploy­ees in my com­pany is about 30 to 35. So, I am hop­ing that the ex­pe­ri­enced (work­ers) who join us will share their wis­dom with the en­er­getic young team we have.”</p>
    <p>The fo­rum is part of this year’s Skill­sFu­ture Month, which started yes­ter­day and will run un­til Aug 16.</p>
    <p>A se­ries of mostly vir­tual events will be or­gan­ised to cater to Sin­ga­pore­ans at dif­fer­ent stages of their ca­reer and life. There will be train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for job seek­ers, es­pe­cially mid-ca­reer ones who have been af­fected by the eco­nomic im­pact of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­ised by SSG and var­i­ous part­ners, Skill­sFu­ture Month 2020 sup­ports the ef­forts of the Na­tional Jobs Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>More than 80 com­mu­nity, ed­u­ca­tion and in­dus­try part­ners are par­tic­i­pat­ing in Skill­sFu­ture Month, which is ex­pected to reach more than 15,000 learn­ers.</p>
    <p>A se­ries of events de­signed to meet the needs of dif­fer­ent work­force seg­ments have been lined up, in­clud­ing live we­bi­nars, on­line classes and work­shops, and vir­tual ex­hi­bi­tions.</p>
    <p>SSG chief ex­ec­u­tive Ong TzeCh’in said: “I hope that the se­ries of Skill­sFu­ture Month ac­tiv­i­ties, both vir­tual and phys­i­cal... will al­low</p>
    <p>HELP­ING VUL­NER­A­BLE WORK­ERS</p>
    <p>We want to tar­get groups that are more vul­ner­a­ble, that need our help, need that six to 12 months re-tool­ing at this stage of their ca­reer, in this cur­rent sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Mid-ca­reer, ma­ture PMETs are one of the most vul­ner­a­ble groups. The com­ing months will not be smooth sail­ing. Work­ers and com­pa­nies will need to ad­just, adapt, build new ca­pa­bil­i­ties and seek out new op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>’’ ED­U­CA­TION MIN­IS­TER ONG YE KUNG</p>
    <p>more Sin­ga­pore­ans to dis­cover new op­por­tu­ni­ties, ex­plore avail­able re­sources and con­tinue their in­di­vid­ual life­long learn­ing jour­neys, even amid these chal­leng­ing times.”</p>
