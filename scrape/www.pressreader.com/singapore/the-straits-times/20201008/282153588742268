    <p>The amount of money raised at this year’s Pres­i­dent’s Star Char­ity is cer­tainly com­mend­able, given that many peo­ple are fac­ing a tough time dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic ($10.4m raised so far in Pres­i­dent’s Star Char­ity 2020, Oct 6).</p>
    <p>I watched the show on Sun­day night and am heart­ened by the ef­forts taken to raise funds for the 72 ben­e­fi­cia­ries sup­ported by the Pres­i­dent’s Chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>How­ever, I am sur­prised by the lack of tele­poll lines for the pub­lic to call and make their dona­tions.</p>
    <p>These hot­lines have been the sta­ple of ev­ery char­ity show, with dif­fer­ent num­bers cor­re­spond­ing to dif­fer­ent do­na­tion amounts.</p>
    <p>Many view­ers would be ac­cus­tomed to hear­ing these num­bers start­ing with “1900-112” in ad­ver­tise­ments pro­mot­ing the char­ity show or in the call for dona­tions through­out the show.</p>
    <p>This time, the call made by the par­tic­i­pants was for the pub­lic to scan the QR code lo­cated at the top left-hand cor­ner of the screen, which was where the tele­poll lines were fea­tured in past char­ity shows. Al­ter­na­tively, dona­tions could be made via the Pres­i­dent’s Star Char­ity web­site.</p>
    <p>While this is a good col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween the Pres­i­dent’s Chal­lenge and banks in the light of more Sin­ga­pore­ans turn­ing to e-pay­ments, peo­ple with­out smart­phones, or a bank­ing app in­stalled on their smart­phones, or In­ter­net ac­cess al­to­gether, would be left out.</p>
    <p>It would have been more con­ve­nient to just pick up the phone and call the tele­poll lines as on­line dona­tions may also be sub­ject to tech­ni­cal is­sues.</p>
    <p>I sug­gest that char­ity or­gan­i­sa­tions re­in­state the tra­di­tional tele­poll lines for fu­ture char­ity shows, in ad­di­tion to adopt­ing dig­i­tal meth­ods.</p>
    <p>This would cater to dif­fer­ent groups of peo­ple and pos­si­bly rake in even more dona­tions to ben­e­fit those in need.</p>
