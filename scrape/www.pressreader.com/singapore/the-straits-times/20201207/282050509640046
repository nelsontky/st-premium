    <p>A young Sin­ga­pore firm is build­ing hy­dro­gen fuel cell sys­tems, which gen­er­ate elec­tric­ity from hy­dro­gen, for land trans­port ap­pli­ca­tions, with a pro­to­type ve­hi­cle to be un­veiled in the first quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>Spec­tronik is hop­ing to be­come the first lo­cal firm to make a work­ing mo­torised ve­hi­cle from the ground up, and one which runs on hy­dro­gen.</p>
    <p>The com­pany was co-founded by In­done­sian Jog­ja­man Jap, 35, and Myan­mar na­tional Zarli Maung Maung, 34, in 2011. Both are Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dents and had moved here when they were pri­mary school pupils.</p>
    <p>They met in 2008 when they were work­ing in a small firm which ex­per­i­mented with hy­dro­gen fuel cells.</p>
    <p>Spec­tronik started by mak­ing fuel cells for sur­veil­lance drones. Later, it de­signed and made its own drones, and has sold more than 100.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers of the Phoenix drones in­clude Boe­ing, China Aerospace and Gen­eral Atomics, an Amer­i­can en­ergy and de­fence cor­po­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Jog­ja­man said its fuel cells are more en­ergy-dense than lithi­u­mion bat­ter­ies, al­low­ing the drones a 90-minute fly-time (ver­sus 30 min­utes for equiv­a­lent bat­tery-pow­ered mod­els).</p>
    <p>The two busi­ness part­ners are now branch­ing out to mak­ing fuel cells for automotive ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>“With a shift from in­di­vid­ual own­er­ship to fleet own­er­ship, where peo­ple do more ride-shar­ing, we feel ve­hi­cles will have to go much longer dis­tances.</p>
    <p>“Their down­time must also be re­duced,” Mr Jog­ja­man said, ex­plain­ing that hy­dro­gen fuel cells can be re­fu­elled as quickly as con­ven­tional com­bus­tion en­gines. In com­par­i­son, bat­tery-pow­ered ve­hi­cles take sev­eral hours to recharge.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, goods ve­hi­cles and public buses can­not af­ford long down­times ei­ther.</p>
    <p>Mr Jog­ja­man added that hy­dro­gen fuel cells pro­vide roughly twice the range of bat­tery-pow­ered elec­tric ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>Not­ing the high cost of fuel cell sys­tems, he said Spec­tronik’s cells are de­signed to be eas­ily re­fur­bish­able (at around 10 per cent of their orig­i­nal cost).</p>
    <p>This al­lows them to be reused far longer than bat­ter­ies, and makes them more eco­nom­i­cally vi­able.</p>
    <p>Mr Zarli Maung Maung said: “If you take the case of a public bus, it can clock 10 times the mileage of an av­er­age car. So, over the course of its statu­tory life­span of 17 years, fuel cell makes more sense.”</p>
    <p>A bat­tery-pow­ered elec­tric bus, although half the cost of a fuel cell model, will need to have its bat­ter­ies changed up to eight times over 17 years.</p>
    <p>And lithium bat­ter­ies con­sti­tute the bulk of an elec­tric ve­hi­cle’s cost.</p>
    <p>As for the cost of hy­dro­gen fuel, which is about twice that of petrol, Mr Jog­ja­man said it would fall when pro­duc­tion meth­ods im­prove.</p>
    <p>To demon­strate the vi­a­bil­ity of its automotive fuel cell sys­tem,</p>
    <p>Spec­tronik has retro­fit­ted a buggy to run on fuel cell here.</p>
    <p>The pro­to­type of its maiden range of fuel cell ve­hi­cles, branded Cruiser, will be a goods van or com­pact shut­tle bus to be as­sem­bled in China.</p>
    <p>The man­u­fac­ture of the fuel cell sys­tem will be done in Sin­ga­pore, as will the re­fur­bish­ing of cells.</p>
    <p>Due in the first quar­ter of next year, the pro­to­type will be built on a new plat­form de­signed to ac­com­mo­date a fuel cell sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Mr Jog­ja­man said the firm is in­vest­ing about $1 mil­lion on the pro­to­type, and will be work­ing with En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore, the Land Trans­port Author­ity and Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force to trial it here.</p>
    <p>“Tim­ing is very im­por­tant,” he added. “When fuel cells for cars sur­faced 15 years ago, the tech­nol­ogy was not ma­ture enough, and the mar­ket was not ready.</p>
    <p>“If our sys­tem used the tech­nol­ogy avail­able back then, the mod­ule would be 10 times as big.”</p>
