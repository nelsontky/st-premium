    <p>The bat­tered avi­a­tion i ndus­try took an­other step to­wards re­cov­ery yes­ter­day with news that Kel­ley Aero­space will in­vest around $150 mil­lion over the next five years on ini­tia­tives, in­clud­ing job cre­ation and man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>The projects will be un­der­taken at the com­pany’s first fa­cil­ity in Seletar Aero­space Park, a former mil­i­tary air­base now home to global and home-grown firms.</p>
    <p>Kel­ley Aero­space said yes­ter­day it will train and up­skill at least 250 lo­cals to retro­fit pri­vate jets and man­u­fac­ture car­bon fi­bre for planes. It is also look­ing to open a fly­ing academy to train pi­lots for its jets.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can firm is launch­ing three pro­grammes here.</p>
    <p>One in­volves buy­ing 100 air­craft by 2024 that will fly pri­vate clients around the world, with in-flight meals pre­pared by Miche­lin chef Bruno Me­nard.</p>
    <p>Clients will be by in­vi­ta­tion only for the pri­vate net­work, which will op­er­ate out of Sin­ga­pore, South Korea, Ja­pan and China.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond pro­gramme is to de­sign, man­u­fac­ture and as­sem­ble un­manned aerial ve­hi­cles (UAVs), in­clud­ing the Ar­row UAV, which has been worked on by en­gi­neers over the past few years.</p>
    <p>Kel­ley Aero­space said it is ready to move for­ward with a pro­to­type, and will need to train em­ploy­ees to help with its man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>It es­ti­mates that it will be able to make the frames of three UAVs ev­ery day when its pro­duc­tion line is fully op­er­a­tional, much faster than the typ­i­cal pace of one ev­ery one to three weeks.</p>
    <p>The third pro­gramme will strengthen its core busi­ness of de­sign­ing and man­u­fac­tur­ing car­bon fi­bre, which is used in the build­ing of air­craft. It plans to work with uni­ver­si­ties and poly­tech­nics here on re­search and de­vel­op­ment to cre­ate ma­te­ri­als that can be stronger, lighter and more durable.</p>
    <p>Kel­ley Aero­space di­rec­tor Aviv Kel­ley hopes the Sin­ga­pore fa­cil­ity can be used as a re­gional hub as well as help in­te­grate the com­pany’s bases in coun­tries in­clud­ing the United States and China.</p>
    <p>“It gives us the con­nec­tion be­tween Ja­pan, the US and China, and gives us many op­por­tu­ni­ties. It’s per­fect for busi­ness,” he said.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s an­nounce­ment comes amid a ten­ta­tive re­cov­ery in the avi­a­tion and aero­space sec­tor.</p>
    <p>A $38 mil­lion cam­pus bring­ing to­gether all of air­plane maker Air­bus’ op­er­a­tions in Sin­ga­pore was of­fi­cially opened last month, a move Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing de­scribed as a “state­ment of con­fi­dence” in the coun­try.</p>
