    <p>BATAM • Po­lice i n In­done­sia have charged four more peo­ple in re­la­tion to the al­leged tor­tur­ing to death of an In­done­sian crew mem­ber found in a freezer aboard a Chi­nese fish­ing ves­sel.</p>
    <p>They were ex­ec­u­tives at In­done­sian re­cruit­ment agen­cies which hire lo­cals – like 20-yearold Hasan Apri­adi who died last month – to work on Chi­nese ships, po­lice said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A Chi­nese su­per­vi­sor on the ves­sel has been charged over Mr Apri­adi’s death and for as­sault­ing other In­done­sian crew.</p>
    <p>In all, six re­cruit­ing agency bosses are fac­ing hu­man traf­fick­ing charges, in­clud­ing al­le­ga­tions that they had lied to dozens of In­done­sians placed aboard Chi­nese fish­ing ves­sels by say­ing they would be work­ing as wait­ers or staff in re­tail stores over­seas, po­lice said.</p>
    <p>“The sus­pects en­gaged in il­le­gal re­cruit­ment and de­ceived the vic­tims with false prom­ises,” said Mr Arie Dhar­manto, direc­tor of the gen­eral crimes unit for In­done­sia’s Riau Is­lands. The sus­pects also face charges that they know­ingly put the crew mem­bers at risk, and could be hit with a max­i­mum life sen­tence if found guilty, ac­cord­ing to po­lice.</p>
    <p>Anti-traf­fick­ing ex­perts say the fish­ing in­dus­try is rid­dled with forced labour, and that ex­ploited work­ers face non-pay­ment of wages, over­work, vi­o­lence and death.</p>
    <p>South-east Asia is a ma­jor source of such labour and un­scrupu­lous re­cruiters tar­get the poor and un­e­d­u­cated with prom­ises of good wages at sea.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, two Chi­nese boats were in­ter­cepted in the Malacca Strait, which sep­a­rates In­done­sia and Malaysia, af­ter the au­thor­i­ties re­ceived in­for­ma­tion that a crew mem­ber had died aboard one of the ves­sels.</p>
    <p>They later found Mr Apri­adi’s frozen body on the ves­sel and ar­rested Chi­nese na­tional Song Chuanyun. The au­thor­i­ties said Song had al­legedly forced the vic­tim to work de­spite be­ing ill, and that he de­prived him of food or wa­ter for sev­eral days be­fore he died in late June.</p>
    <p>Anti-traf­fick­ing ex­perts say the fish­ing in­dus­try is rid­dled with forced labour, and that ex­ploited work­ers face non-pay­ment of wages, over­work... and death.</p>
