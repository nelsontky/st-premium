    <p>LIN MEIJIAO JOINS INSTAGRAM AT LAST:</p>
    <p>Vet­eran lo­cal ac­tress Lin Meijiao (far left) has fi­nally suc­cumbed.</p>
    <p>The 56-year-old was one of the few lo­cal ac­tresses with­out a so­cial me­dia ac­count, but she fi­nally set up one last week after much en­cour­age­ment from her man­ager as well as her daugh­ter, ac­tress Chan­talle Ng (left), 25.</p>
    <p>Lin kicked off her Instagram jour­ney by post­ing a photo (be­low) of her daugh­ter when she was three years old. Lin wrote: “Hello to Instagram!”</p>
    <p>Ng is Lin’s daugh­ter with her ex-hus­band, for­mer ac­tor Huang Yil­iang.</p>
    <p>In her sec­ond post, Lin put up two pic­tures she took with her daugh­ter and men­tioned the up­com­ing Me­di­a­corp drama,</p>
    <p>My Star Bride. Both of them are act­ing in the show.</p>
    <p>Ng plays Fang­cao, a Viet­namese bride in Sin­ga­pore, while Lin plays her mother-in-law.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with Lianhe Wan­bao, Lin said she was pre­vi­ously hes­i­tant about so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>“I am afraid of press­ing the wrong but­ton and not sure how to man­age the ac­count if I have one,” she said.</p>
    <p>Lin, who played lead roles in dra­mas such as Pretty Faces (1991), has also made a mark in dra­mas such as The Lit­tle Ny­onya (2008),</p>
    <p>Break­out (2010) and Joys Of Life (2012).</p>
    <p>The ac­tress said she did not even have e-mail and What­sApp pre­vi­ously as she felt that it was suf­fi­cient to use a mo­bile phone to make calls.</p>
    <p>She started us­ing What­sApp only two to three years ago to com­mu­ni­cate with her daugh­ter while she was film­ing over­seas.</p>
    <p>Lin said she de­cided to join so­cial me­dia to keep in touch with view­ers.</p>
    <p>“I still ap­pear on-screen, so view­ers may be in­ter­ested in what I am do­ing,” she said.</p>
    <p>Lin has al­ready learnt how to post Instagram Stories, Wan­bao re­ported.</p>
    <p>“My daugh­ter helped to post me film­ing at the air­port that day. I couldn’t see any­thing as I didn’t wear read­ing glasses,” she said. “But the later ones were posted by me.”</p>
