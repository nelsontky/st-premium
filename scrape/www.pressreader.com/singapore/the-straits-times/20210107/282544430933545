    <p>A quirky new his­tor­i­cal biopic, Tesla, tells the story of Nikola Tesla – the in­ven­tor of the mod­ern al­ter­nat­ing cur­rent elec­tri­cal sys­tem who, in re­cent years, has gained a cult fol­low­ing as an un­der­dog sci­en­tific hero.</p>
    <p>In the film, which opens in Sin­ga­pore cin­e­mas to­day, Ethan Hawke plays the enig­matic Tesla, who in the late 19th cen­tury was dream­ing up un­prece­dented tech­nolo­gies for trans­mit­ting en­ergy, light and in­for­ma­tion wire­lessly all over the world.</p>
    <p>Kyle MacLach­lan plays Tesla’s great­est ri­val, the in­ven­tor Thomas Edi­son, who was far more savvy about busi­ness, money and self-pro­mo­tion.</p>
    <p>A poor im­mi­grant from what is now Croa­tia, the bril­liant but so­cially awk­ward Tesla was at one point Edi­son’s em­ployee, but failed to make Edi­son see the prom­ise of his in­ven­tion, the al­ter­nat­ing cur­rent mo­tor.</p>
    <p>Thus be­gan a life­long ri­valry be­tween the two men, who were di­a­met­ri­cally op­posed in tem­per­a­ment.</p>
    <p>The film cat­a­logues this, along with Tesla’s tri­umphs and set­backs, in an ec­cen­tric, retro-mod­ern style with a de­lib­er­ately anachro­nis­tic elec­tronic sound­track.</p>
    <p>The film-maker and ac­tors say it is hard not to be fas­ci­nated by the bril­liant but com­pli­cated man and his volatile re­la­tion­ship with Edi­son.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at an on­line screen­ing of the movie, writer-direc­tor Michael Almereyda says Tesla was a man of many con­tra­dic­tions and won­ders how he could “see into the fab­ric of re­al­ity and the forces of nature, and at the same time be con­sis­tently un­able to con­nect to other hu­man be­ings”.</p>
    <p>“That was the ques­tion we were ask­ing through­out the film. Be­cause he was a very mys­te­ri­ous man and part of the mo­ti­va­tion of mak­ing the film was to edge closer to the mys­tery.”</p>
    <p>Almereyda, 61, was in­spired by a book pub­lished in 1944, the year af­ter Tesla died.</p>
    <p>Prodi­gal Ge­nius: The Life Of Nikola Tesla was writ­ten by bi­og­ra­pher James O’Neill, who knew Tesla and was “daz­zled” by him.</p>
    <p>“It was an air­brushed por­trait in many respects, but it’s full of drama. I could just pic­ture this man hav­ing ad­ven­tures with light and light­ning and new tech­nolo­gies, and it was ex­cit­ing to imag­ine what that movie could be like.”</p>
    <p>And no mat­ter how “mytho­log­i­cal and ‘comic book-y’ some of the sto­ries are about him, the truth is still breath­tak­ing”, says the film-maker, who also di­rected the science-fic­tion ro­mance Mar­jorie Prime (2017).</p>
    <p>He adds: “There’s some­thing poignant about not only Tesla’s suc­cesses but also his fail­ures, and how our coun­try didn’t fully ac­knowl­edge and em­brace his ideas, and he was a for­got­ten and thwarted man.”</p>
    <p>Hawke – the Os­car-nom­i­nated star of the com­ing-of-age drama Boy­hood (2014) and crime thriller Train­ing Day (2001) – says play­ing Tesla was “one of those parts where you can do noth­ing but come up short – you can never do as good a job as should be done”.</p>
    <p>Still, the 50-year-old felt an obli­ga­tion to em­body Tesla in a way that was au­then­tic.</p>
    <p>“I tried to read as much as I could – let­ters and es­says he wrote and things he said – and I’d mem­o­rise them, film my­self and send that to Michael, just to start to hear his voice, so that Michael and I could be in di­a­logue with him.”</p>
    <p>Hawke says the film, how­ever, is not meant to be a con­ven­tional doc­u­men­tary-style biopic, but rather an artis­tic ren­der­ing of the man.</p>
    <p>“It’s not Tesla, it’s not who he is – he’s very beau­ti­ful and spe­cific – but we wanted to make art that could speak to now.”</p>
    <p>MacLach­lan, 61, was fas­ci­nated by the ten­sion be­tween Tesla and Edi­son, who went on to in­vent one of the first elec­tric light bulbs and one of the first movie cam­eras.</p>
    <p>“That was one of the re­ally in­ter­est­ing things that Michael wrote in the film. There’s what we know and there are the what ifs, and we feel the loss from the in­abil­ity of these two men to work to­gether,” says the Twin Peaks (1989 to 2017) and Dune (1984) star.</p>
    <p>Hawke adds that if Tesla were alive to­day, he would love to get the in­ven­tor’s opin­ion about the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He says: “As a guy who was a fa­mous germa­phobe, I’m sure the new virus would be no sur­prise to him. But what he might say about how we could trans­form our­selves through this in­cu­ba­tion pe­riod, and how we could change, I’d be su­per in­ter­ested to hear.”</p>
