    <p>Rus­sian op­po­si­tion politi­cian Alexei Navalny (above) in a photo posted on his In­sta­gram feed yes­ter­day, five days af­ter a Ber­lin hospi­tal said he had been taken off a ven­ti­la­tor and could breathe in­de­pen­dently.</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny, the lead­ing op­po­nent of Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin, fell ill in Siberia last month and was air­lifted to Ber­lin. Ger­many says lab­o­ra­tory tests in three coun­tries have de­ter­mined he was poi­soned with a Novi­chok nerve agent, and Western gov­ern­ments have de­manded an ex­pla­na­tion from Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>“Let me tell how my recovery is go­ing. It is al­ready a clear path although a long one,” Mr Navalny wrote. He said in the In­sta­gram up­date that he still could not use his phone and had dif­fi­culty try­ing to pour wa­ter into his glass or climb­ing stairs be­cause his legs trem­bled.</p>
    <p>“There are many prob­lems yet to be solved but amaz­ing doc­tors from the Charite hospi­tal have solved the main one,” the post said. “They turned me from a ‘tech­ni­cally alive hu­man be­ing’ into some­one who has high chances to be­come... a man who can quickly scroll In­sta­gram and un­der­stands with­out think­ing where to put his likes.”</p>
