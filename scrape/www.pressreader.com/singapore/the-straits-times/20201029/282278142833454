    <p>BARCELONA Josep Maria Bar­tomeu, the em­bat­tled pres­i­dent of Barcelona, an­nounced his res­ig­na­tion on Tues­day, bring­ing an abrupt end to a six-year ten­ure in which he had taken power al­most by ac­ci­dent, nearly driven away the best player in the club’s history and pro­voked a re­call ef­fort that many ex­pected to lead to his ouster as soon as next month.</p>
    <p>The en­tire board of the La Liga giants re­signed along with Bar­tomeu, who said he was step­ping down to spare the club’s tens of thou­sands of mem­bers from hav­ing to vote in a ref­er­en­dum on his lead­er­ship dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We can­not and do not want to be in the po­si­tion of hav­ing to choose be­tween the pro­tec­tion of health and the ex­er­cise of the right to vote. And that is why we have made the de­ci­sion not to call the vote and to re­sign im­me­di­ately from our du­ties,” a som­bre-look­ing Bar­tomeu said in a late night speech broad­cast on the club’s web­site.</p>
    <p>While an­nounc­ing his res­ig­na­tion, the Cata­lan also made the bomb­shell claim that on Mon­day, he had agreed with the lead­ers of what he de­scribed as Europe’s other “big clubs” to par­tic­i­pate in a Euro­pean “su­per league”, a closed com­pe­ti­tion that has been much dis­cussed in re­cent years, but one that faces a num­ber of po­lit­i­cal, sport­ing and eco­nomic hur­dles if it is to be­come re­al­ity.</p>
    <p>A fi­nal de­ci­sion whether or not to par­tic­i­pate in such a com­pe­ti­tion would face a vote of Barcelona’s mem­bers, he added.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, La Liga pres­i­dent Javier Te­bas, an avowed critic of the plans to shake up Euro­pean foot­ball, said that Bar­tomeu’s de­part­ing com­ments con­firmed his “ig­no­rance” about foot­ball and de­scribed the new pro­posed league as “a weak and imag­i­nary com­pe­ti­tion”.</p>
    <p>“Sad end for a pres­i­dent with suc­cesses and lately, many mis­takes,” he tweeted.</p>
    <p>Bar­tomeu’s depar­ture came only weeks af­ter the fan-owned club’s mem­bers had col­lected the thou­sands of sig­na­tures re­quired to forced a vote on the lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>Many of them blame him for lead­ing the club into the big­gest cri­sis in its modern history – he over­saw a scan­dal af­ter em­ploy­ing a so­cial me­dia firm that went on to at­tack the play­ers on­line, cul­mi­nat­ing in the res­ig­na­tion of six board mem­bers in April and Barca’s first tro­phy­less sea­son in 12 years last term.</p>
    <p>He was also held re­spon­si­ble for nearly driv­ing away cap­tain Lionel Messi, who briefly an­nounced his in­ten­tion to de­part in late Au­gust, only to re­verse his plan weeks later.</p>
    <p>The star Ar­gentina for­ward had crit­i­cised Barca’s lead­er­ship last sea­son and grum­bled about the di­rec­tion of the club af­ter a five-year Cham­pi­ons League drought.</p>
    <p>In an­nounc­ing his de­ci­sion to re­main at the Nou Camp last month, though, Messi blamed Bar­tomeu per­son­ally for break­ing his word to him, say­ing he had re­neged on a prom­ise to let him leave at the end of last sea­son.</p>
    <p>An in­terim board of di­rec­tors has been put in place and while the next elec­tions have been sched­uled for March, they are now ex­pected to be fast tracked.</p>
    <p>Among those in con­tention to be the new pres­i­dent in­clude Vic­tor Font, Joan La­porta and Jordi Roche.</p>
    <p>Sad end for a pres­i­dent with suc­cesses and lately, many mis­takes.</p>
