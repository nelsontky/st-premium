    <p>Ac­tor Jamie Foxx has lent his voice to var­i­ous an­i­mated char­ac­ters, but those jobs failed to im­press his 11-year-old daugh­ter Anelise.</p>
    <p>With the Pixar production Soul, though, the girl fi­nally gave her stamp of ap­proval.</p>
    <p>As re­counted by Foxx, 53, in a re­cent on­line press con­fer­ence, his daugh­ter told him: “Yeah, dad, you’ve done an­i­ma­tion, but not the good kind. But you’re in a Pixar now. You made it.”</p>
    <p>Pixar – the stu­dio with 16 Academy Awards and the mak­ers of the Toy Story fran­chise (1995 to 2019), among oth­ers – will re­lease Soul in Sin­ga­pore to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>In the com­edy-drama, Foxx voices Joe Gard­ner, a mu­sic teacher who yearns to play jazz in a pro­fes­sional out­fit.</p>
    <p>An ac­ci­dent takes his life just as he is about to re­alise his dream. In­stead of go­ing to the hereafter, his soul finds its way to The Great Be­fore, a sta­tion where fresh souls are pre­pared to oc­cupy bod­ies on Earth.</p>
    <p>Foxx has pre­vi­ously voiced char­ac­ters in the tele­vi­sion car­toon C-Bear And Ja­mal (1996), as well as an­i­mated film Rio (2011) and its se­quel Rio 2 (2014).</p>
    <p>But he says Soul has a spe­cial sig­nif­i­cance for him be­cause one of its key ideas – that one has a duty to seek joy – hit home when his sis­ter, Deon­dra Dixon, died at age 36 in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>She was a global am­bas­sador for Down syn­drome and had been liv­ing with Foxx for the last 18 years.</p>
    <p>“She lived ev­ery sin­gle mo­ment to the hilt. She was al­ways so ex­cited,” Foxx says. “In a beau­ti­ful, strange way, los­ing her has given me a vi­sion of all the joy she taught us about when she was liv­ing. It’s ex­em­pli­fied in this film.”</p>
    <p>For di­rec­tor and co-writer Pete Doc­ter, 52, mak­ing Soul was his way of ex­press­ing ques­tions that have trou­bled him.</p>
    <p>“What’s the world about? What am I sup­posed to be do­ing with my life? I am try­ing to fig­ure this out for my­self,” he says.</p>
    <p>In Doc­ter’s pre­vi­ous films – such as In­side Out (2015), Up (2009) and Monsters, Inc (2001) – most of the lead char­ac­ters were white Amer­i­cans or fic­tional crea­tures.</p>
    <p>That Soul’s lead char­ac­ter is a black man came about be­cause Doc­ter needed a cen­tral fig­ure who was search­ing for ful­fil­ment in an artis­tic way, while also be­ing in­ter­est­ing to the au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>Mak­ing Joe an ac­tor or a sci­en­tist was con­sid­ered un­til it was sug­gested that he be a jazz mu­si­cian. That hit the right note. As a pur­suit, jazz has a pu­rity. “It’s self­less. You don’t go into jazz to get rich and fa­mous. You do it be­cause you have a pas­sion for it, you love it. And it’s fas­ci­nat­ing to watch. When you see some­one play, it’s like a magic trick,” Doc­ter says.</p>
    <p>Be­cause jazz has been called black im­pro­vi­sa­tional mu­sic, it was nat­u­ral for Joe to be black and have the story set in his culture in New York City, with its black-run bar­ber­shops, tailor shops and jazz clubs.</p>
    <p>Black screen­writer Kemp Pow­ers, who co-wrote and co-di­rected the film, says he in­sisted on never di­lut­ing what he calls the “black stuff” for fear of alien­at­ing gen­eral au­di­ences. He says: “If you’re not Ital­ian, are you go­ing to not en­joy The God­fa­ther or The So­pra­nos? That sounds ab­surd, right?”</p>
    <p>Tina Fey plays 22, a soul who dis­rupts the smooth oper­a­tions of</p>
    <p>The Great Be­fore by re­fus­ing to be born.</p>
    <p>Earth holds no ap­peal for her and she dis­obeys in­struc­tions, talks back to her coun­sel­lors and hides from au­thor­ity fig­ures.</p>
    <p>To play the trou­ble­maker, who has a change of heart about Earth af­ter bit­ing into a clas­sic New York pizza, the 50-year-old ac­tress says she did not have to look far for in­spi­ra­tion. She has two daugh­ters, aged 15 and nine.</p>
    <p>“I must have been chan­nelling them a lit­tle bit. The teenager has a scep­ti­cal at­ti­tude about things she is not sure about,” she says.</p>
    <p>“And I also re­mem­bered how great it was the first time I had a New York pizza.”</p>
