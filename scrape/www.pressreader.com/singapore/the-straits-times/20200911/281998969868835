    <p>Another mem­ber of a trio who stole more than $350,000 in cash from a prospec­tive bit­coin buyer ad­mit­ted in court that he was in­volved in the rob­bery.</p>
    <p>Jaromel Gee Ming Li, 29, was sen­tenced to three years in jail and 12 strokes of the cane yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He pleaded guilty to one count of en­gag­ing in a con­spir­acy with Mohd Ab­dul Rah­man Mo­hamad and Syed Mokhtar Syed Yu­sope, both 39, to com­mit rob­bery in 2018.</p>
    <p>Ab­dul Rah­man’s case is still pend­ing while Mokhtar pleaded guilty to a rob­bery charge on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments stated that Gee was in­volved in bit­coin bro­ker­age and would ar­range trans­ac­tions be­tween par­ties in­tend­ing to buy and sell the dig­i­tal cur­rency.</p>
    <p>He also en­gaged Ab­dul Rah­man to help him with the trans­ac­tions, which typ­i­cally in­volved prospec­tive buy­ers bring­ing large sums of cash in ex­change for the bit­coins.</p>
    <p>In April 2018, the pair planned to rob po­ten­tial buy­ers by not trans­fer­ring or sell­ing any bit­coins to them.</p>
    <p>On April 8 that year, Malaysian Pang Joon Hau was in Singapore to buy bit­coins.</p>
    <p>He had cash to­talling $365,000 in his pos­ses­sion, and was stay­ing at a branch of the Ho­tel 81 chain in Mid­dle Road with a bit­coin in­vestor, Mr Teo Chern Wei.</p>
    <p>Gee had found out about Mr Pang’s in­ten­tion from a con­tact and alerted Ab­dul Rah­man, telling him to take along another per­son to com­mit the rob­bery.</p>
    <p>Ab­dul Rah­man roped in Mokhtar, and the two met at the ho­tel at around 11.40pm the same day.</p>
    <p>The pair and a bit­coin bro­ker, Mr Lee Chee Kwok, later met Mr Pang and Mr Teo in the ho­tel room.</p>
    <p>Mokhtar punched Mr Pang and</p>
    <p>Mr Lee, while Ab­dul Rah­man at­tacked Mr Teo.</p>
    <p>The duo left af­ter Ab­dul Rah­man grabbed a back­pack con­tain­ing the $365,000.</p>
    <p>Mokhtar was later re­warded with $10,000 but Gee did not re­ceive any money as Ab­dul Rah­man was ar­rested two days later.</p>
    <p>Gee was ar­rested on April 18 that year.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments did not state how his in­volve­ment in the rob­bery was dis­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>His jail sen­tence has been back­dated to Feb 7 this year, when he was re­manded.</p>
    <p>Court records showed that he also faces charges for cheat­ing in un­re­lated in­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>Of­fend­ers convicted of com­mit­ting rob­bery be­tween 7pm and 7am can be jailed for up to 14 years and re­ceive at least 12 strokes of the cane.</p>
    <p>Ab­dul Rah­man’s for­mer wife, Yo­gesh­wry Ra­man, was also in court yes­ter­day, where she pleaded guilty to one count of dis­hon­estly re­ceiv­ing stolen goods from him.</p>
    <p>These in­cluded $5,000 in cash and items which he ob­tained in ex­change for the stolen money, such as a Rolex watch worth $45,800.</p>
    <p>He had passed the items to Yo­gesh­wry, 35, for safe­keep­ing on April 10 near a Mar­riott ho­tel in Or­chard Road.</p>
    <p>Yo­gesh­wry lied to the po­lice af­ter her for­mer hus­band’s ar­rest, say­ing she had not met him or re­ceived any items from him.</p>
    <p>She also pleaded guilty to us­ing crim­i­nal force on a po­lice of­fi­cer by spit­ting at him in a sep­a­rate in­ci­dent at her res­i­dence in 2017.</p>
    <p>District Judge Brenda Tan sen­tenced Yo­gesh­wry to nine weeks in jail and she is ex­pected to sur­ren­der on Oct 15 to be­gin serv­ing her jail term.</p>
    <p>For the of­fence of dis­hon­estly re­ceiv­ing stolen prop­erty, she could have been jailed for up to five years and/or fined.</p>
    <p>She could also have been jailed for up to two years and/or fined for us­ing crim­i­nal force against the po­lice of­fi­cer.</p>
