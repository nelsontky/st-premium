    <p>Of­fi­cials close to US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump have de­nied al­le­ga­tions in The New York Times that be­fore leav­ing the White House next month, he plans to of­fer par­dons to his im­me­di­ate fam­ily mem­bers and as­so­ci­ates in or­der to shield them from ex­ist­ing or fu­ture pros­e­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>“Fake News NYT lies again,” tweeted Mr Rudy Gi­u­liani, the Pres­i­dent’s at­tor­ney, in re­sponse to the al­le­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Still, through­out his four-year pres­i­dency, Mr Trump has re­peat­edly used his pow­ers to par­don peo­ple for po­lit­i­cal rea­sons. And in so do­ing, he has re­lied on the fact that, un­usu­ally for a coun­try which is fa­mous for its cul­ture of lit­i­ga­tion, the pow­ers of the United States pres­i­dent in this re­spect re­main un­clear.</p>
    <p>The right of heads of state to par­don peo­ple ei­ther con­victed or about to be charged with spe­cific crim­i­nal of­fences ex­ists in the Con­sti­tu­tions of most coun­tries, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, for one prac­ti­cal rea­son: It is es­sen­tial to any le­gal sys­tem that one au­thor­ity in the state should have the abil­ity to over­ride the ap­pli­ca­tion of the law in cer­tain cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>How­ever, be­cause the need to in­tro­duce flex­i­bil­ity in a le­gal sys­tem is pre­cisely what par­dons are all about, they are not very well de­fined. The Con­sti­tu­tions of most na­tions con­cen­trate on de­scrib­ing how rather than when they should be used.</p>
    <p>But the US Con­sti­tu­tion is par­tic­u­larly vague on the mat­ter; it sim­ply states that the pres­i­dent “shall have the power to grant re­prieves and par­dons for of­fences against the United States”.</p>
    <p>There are only two clear ex­cep­tions: the of­fence for which a par­don may be of­fered must be a fed­eral rather than state one, and the pres­i­dent can­not is­sue par­dons if he is sub­jected to im­peach­ment by Congress. But apart from that, in the­ory, he can do as he pleases.</p>
    <p>In gen­eral, peo­ple ask­ing for a pres­i­den­tial par­don go through the Of­fice of the Par­don At­tor­ney in the US Jus­tice Depart­ment.</p>
    <p>Yet plenty of pres­i­dents have by­passed this of­fice.</p>
    <p>There are also plenty of his­toric cases where par­dons were given well be­fore the peo­ple con­cerned were even sub­jected to any le­gal pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>In 1974, for in­stance, Pres­i­dent Ger­ald Ford par­doned Richard Nixon, his im­me­di­ate pre­de­ces­sor, from any crim­i­nal pros­e­cu­tion, de­spite the fact that none was started.</p>
    <p>And dur­ing the late 1970s, Pres­i­dent Jimmy Carter is­sued a gen­eral par­don to all US ci­ti­zens who evaded be­ing drafted into the mil­i­tary be­cause they op­posed the Viet­nam War.</p>
    <p>Even the dead can ben­e­fit from pres­i­den­tial clemency.</p>
    <p>Su­san B. An­thony, a fa­mous US cham­pion for gen­der equal­ity, re­ceived a par­don from Pres­i­dent Trump in Au­gust, al­most 150 years af­ter she was con­victed of at­tempt­ing to vote at a time when women had no such right.</p>
    <p>US com­men­ta­tors who now claim to be out­raged by spec­u­la­tion that Mr Trump is about to par­don peo­ple who helped his po­lit­i­cal and busi­ness ca­reer would do well to re­mem­ber that other White House oc­cu­pants have also done pre­cisely that.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Bill Clin­ton, for in­stance, par­doned fi­nancier Marc Rich from tax fraud charges; the fact that Mr Rich’s wife had do­nated large amounts of money to the Clin­tons was, ap­par­ently, just a co­in­ci­dence.</p>
    <p>Mr Clin­ton was also a pi­o­neer in</p>
    <p>of­fer­ing par­dons to mem­bers of the pres­i­dent’s fam­ily: on his very last day in of­fice, Mr Clin­ton par­doned his half-brother from drug-re­lated charges.</p>
    <p>So, if de­spite cur­rent de­nials, Pres­i­dent Trump were to of­fer his chil­dren and their spouses par­dons, he will be fol­low­ing rather than break­ing Amer­i­can tra­di­tion, al­beit on a grander scale.</p>
    <p>In the­ory, the par­dons can also be is­sued in se­cret, although they will have to be re­vealed should any of these peo­ple face fu­ture pros­e­cu­tions.</p>
    <p>The big­gest unan­swer­able at this stage is whether the pres­i­dent can also par­don him­self.</p>
    <p>A le­gal opin­ion pro­duced by the Jus­tice Depart­ment back in 1974 con­cluded that a US pres­i­dent has no pow­ers to par­don him­self, since that would “vi­o­late the ba­sic le­gal prin­ci­ple that no one may be a judge in his own case”.</p>
    <p>But the mat­ter has never been tested in court, and we know that Mr Trump be­lieves he has such pow­ers. In a tweet back in June 2018, he wrote that “as has been stated by nu­mer­ous le­gal schol­ars, I have the ab­so­lute right to par­don my­self”.</p>
    <p>Ei­ther way, two con­clu­sions can be drawn from the cur­rent de­bate in the US.</p>
    <p>The first is that Pres­i­dent Trump has ev­ery in­ten­tion of us­ing to the full his clemency pow­ers to suit his pur­poses.</p>
    <p>And, sec­ond, that the ques­tion of pres­i­den­tial pow­ers may fi­nally end up be­fore the courts, and could well reach the Supreme Court where sup­port­ers of Pres­i­dent Trump’s Re­pub­li­can Party are now in a ma­jor­ity.</p>
