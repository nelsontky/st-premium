    <p>WORSE TO COME</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent-elect J oe Bi­den has said “more peo­ple may die” if out­go­ing Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump con­tin­ues block­ing the tran­si­tion of power in the United States as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic wors­ens, and he urged Congress to pass new re­lief leg­is­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den on Mon­day said that busi­ness and labour lead­ers had sig­nalled will­ing­ness to work to­gether to bol­ster the pan­demic­bat­tered US econ­omy, but stressed that Covid-19 must be brought un­der con­trol first.</p>
    <p>The Demo­cratic Pres­i­dent-elect de­liv­ered a speech and took ques­tions from re­porters in Wilmington, Delaware, af­ter con­sult­ing jointly with the chief ex­ec­u­tives of top US com­pa­nies and labour lead­ers. He wel­comed fur­ther progress in Covid-19 vac­cine de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den will in­herit an econ­omy that has suf­fered mil­lions of job losses amid a pan­demic that has killed more than 247,000 peo­ple in the US. Amer­ica’s Covid-19 cases are surg­ing as he pre­pares to take of­fice on Jan 20.</p>
    <p>“We’re go­ing into a very dark winter. Things are go­ing to get much tougher be­fore they get eas­ier,” he said of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den again called upon the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion to co­op­er­ate with his tran­si­tion team on con­tain­ing the surge in cases. “More peo­ple may die if we don’t co­or­di­nate,” he said.</p>
    <p>He also urged Congress to pass pan­demic re­lief leg­is­la­tion. Talks on such leg­is­la­tion had stalled for months even be­fore the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den in­sisted, how­ever, that Mr Trump’s re­fusal to con­cede was not in­hibit­ing his tran­si­tion ef­forts. “I find this more em­bar­rass­ing for the coun­try than de­bil­i­tat­ing for my abil­ity to get started,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent-elect was set yes­ter­day to fo­cus on shap­ing his core White House team and re­ceive a brief­ing on na­tional se­cu­rity threats from his own ad­vis­ers. Mr Trump has blocked him from re­ceiv­ing clas­si­fied in­tel­li­gence brief­ings usu­ally pro­vided to the suc­ces­sor in a tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>On other eco­nomic mat­ters, Mr Bi­den said he plans to pur­sue “a fairer tax struc­ture” with cor­po­ra­tions pay­ing their fair share, and added that he wanted to see a US$15 (S$20) hourly min­i­mum wage na­tion­wide.</p>
    <p>He also said no gov­ern­ment con­tracts will be given to com­pa­nies that do not make their prod­ucts in the US.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den and Vice-Pres­i­den­t­elect Ka­mala Har­ris ear­lier held a mid­day video con­fer­ence with sev­eral chief ex­ec­u­tives, in­clud­ing Gen­eral Mo­tors’ Ms Mary Barra, Mi­crosoft’s Mr Satya Nadella, Tar­get’s Mr Brian Cor­nell and Gap’s Ms So­nia Syn­gal.</p>
    <p>In their state­ments, the com­pa­nies re­ferred to Mr Bi­den as the “Pres­i­dent-elect”, and Gen­eral Mo­tors said it is look­ing for­ward to</p>
    <p>“work­ing with the new ad­min­is­tra­tion” – tacit re­jec­tions of Mr Trump’s chal­lenge to the elec­tion re­sults.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump on Mon­day again re­fused to ac­cept his elec­tion loss.</p>
    <p>His na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser Robert O’Brien said the same day that he is pre­pared to en­sure a pro­fes­sional tran­si­tion to Mr Bi­den’s team. “If the Bi­den-Har­ris ticket is de­ter­mined to be the win­ner, and ob­vi­ously things look like that now, we’ll have a very pro­fes­sional tran­si­tion from the Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil, there’s no ques­tion about it,” Mr O’Brien said.</p>
    <p>In the state-by-state elec­toral col­lege, Mr Bi­den sur­passed the 270 votes needed to win with 306 votes to Mr Trump’s 232.</p>
    <p>As states work to cer­tify those re­sults be­fore a Dec 8 dead­line, Mr Trump and his sup­port­ers have claimed that he was cheated of vic­tory by fraud, but so far those base­less al­le­ga­tions have failed to gain trac­tion in court.</p>
    <p>We’re go­ing into a very dark winter. Things are go­ing to get much tougher be­fore they get eas­ier.</p>
