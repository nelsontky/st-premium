    <p>SIS­TERON • Aus­tralian Caleb Ewan timed his ef­fort to per­fec­tion to win the third stage of the Tour de France in a bunch sprint at the end of a 198km hilly ride through the Alpine foothills yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>De­ce­un­inck-Quick Step’s Sam Ben­nett looked in con­trol, but the Ir­ish­man un­der­es­ti­mated the head­wind and had to set­tle for sec­ond place as he watched the Lot­toSoudal sprinter whizz around him to snatch his fourth over­all stage win, with Ital­ian Gi­a­como Niz­zolo tak­ing third place.</p>
    <p>“In the last kilo­me­tre, I was a lit­tle bit too far for­ward so I dropped back a bit into the wheels then that gave me a bit of time just to rest the legs a lit­tle bit,” the 26-year-old Ewan said. “In the end, it worked per­fectly. Com­ing from be­hind is a bit of a risk, but I found my way through the bar­rier and I came with a lot of speed.”</p>
    <p>Ewan was proud to win again on the big­gest stage, a year af­ter tak­ing three stage vic­to­ries on his first par­tic­i­pa­tion in the Tour. “I’m so happy to get an­other win and then prove last year was no fluke. We have to take ev­ery sprint­ers’ op­por­tu­nity we can this year be­cause they are quite rare this year.”</p>
    <p>Ju­lian Alaphilipp­e failed to repli­cate his stage 2 win on Sun­day, but he still man­aged to re­tain the over­all leader’s yel­low jer­sey.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old, de­scribed by for­mer Tour win­ner Geraint Thomas as the “dar­ling of France”, vowed he “would not be giv­ing it (the lead) up” and so it proved yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>No French­man has won the Tour since 1985 and the home hope­ful is aim­ing to go one bet­ter this year, hav­ing led the Tour for 14 days last year be­fore wilt­ing on the penul­ti­mate stage to fin­ish fifth over­all.</p>
    <p>To­day’s fourth stage is a 160.5km ef­fort from Sis­teron to OrcieresMe­r­lette for the first sum­mit fin­ish of the race, with Bri­ton Adam Yates, who trails Alaphilipp­e by four sec­onds over­all, aim­ing to over­take him.</p>
    <p>There were also two high-pro­file crashes, just like the pre­vi­ous two stages, with the pour­ing au­tumn rain prov­ing to be treach­er­ous, un­like the clear skies when the Tour is held in its usual slot in early July.</p>
    <p>Cofidis’ An­thony Perez was forced to aban­don the race with a rib frac­ture and a pos­si­ble col­lapsed lung af­ter crash­ing into his team’s car, while Wout van Aert also had an ac­ci­dent some 6km from the line, though the Jum­boVisma rider man­aged to cross the fin­ish­ing line.</p>
