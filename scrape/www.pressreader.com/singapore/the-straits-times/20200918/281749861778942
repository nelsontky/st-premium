    <p>Test kits that can de­ter­mine if a per­son has Covid-19 in min­utes are not be­ing used in na­tional swab­bing ex­er­cises as they are not sen­si­tive enough to de­tect ev­ery in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>“They give false neg­a­tive re­sults – they miss true cases,” said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ray­mond Lin, direc­tor of the Na­tional Pub­lic Health Lab­o­ra­tory at the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Diseases (NCID).</p>
    <p>Prof Lin told The Straits Times: “Cur­rently avail­able anti­gen rapid test kits can miss as many as one in six cases, or even more. If we miss cases, we will have more out­breaks.”</p>
    <p>NCID will con­tinue to look for test kits that are fast and ac­cu­rate, he added.</p>
    <p>More than 120 Covid-19 di­ag­nos­tic test kits have re­ceived pro­vi­sional au­tho­ri­sa­tion from the Health Sciences Author­ity (HSA), rang­ing from poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) kits to anti­gen and serol­ogy ones.</p>
    <p>All three work dif­fer­ently.</p>
    <p>PCR tests look for frag­ments of the virus’ ge­netic ma­te­rial in a pa­tient sam­ple and are con­sid­ered the “gold stan­dard” test for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>But the en­tire pro­cess – from swab­bing a pa­tient to send­ing the sam­ple to a lab­o­ra­tory and the PCR pro­cess it­self – can take up to a day. It can also be costly, and re­quires trained per­son­nel and spe­cialised equip­ment to ad­min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Anti­gen test kits, on the other hand, are point-of-care tests that look for proteins on the virus sur­face and can yield quick re­sults, usu­ally within min­utes.</p>
    <p>Serol­ogy tests, which de­tect the pres­ence of an­ti­bod­ies, are mainly used to tell if a per­son has been in­fected in the past, and not to di­ag­nose patients.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion set out its gen­eral rec­om­men­da­tions on the use of such rapid test kits.</p>
    <p>The guide­lines in­clude spe­cific cir­cum­stances, such as deal­ing with sus­pected out­breaks of Covid-19 in re­mote set­tings where PCR test­ing is not im­me­di­ately avail­able, and for mon­i­tor­ing trends in dis­ease in­ci­dence in com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik-Ying, dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, noted that be­cause rapid di­ag­nos­tic tests are cheaper and less in­va­sive than PCR tests, their pru­dent and re­peated de­ploy­ment could sup­ple­ment na­tional mea­sures to con­trol Covid-19.</p>
    <p>But they have to be used in a way to re­duce the po­ten­tial of false read­ings – whether pos­i­tive or neg­a­tive – from ham­per­ing the sys­tem, he said.</p>
    <p>If pro­to­col dic­tates that read­ings from rapid tests are acted upon, for ex­am­ple, false neg­a­tives could seed new out­breaks, while false pos­i­tives could add strain on the hos­pi­tal sys­tem and the pa­tient’s pock­ets.</p>
    <p>But Prof Teo said there was po­ten­tial for rapid test kits to be de­ployed in cer­tain sce­nar­ios, such as in pop­u­la­tion seg­ments un­der­go­ing rou­tine mon­i­tor­ing.</p>
    <p>“Mi­grant work­ers are be­ing tested fort­nightly, and the pro­cess of un­der­go­ing PCR swabs ev­ery 14 days can ac­tu­ally be quite trau­ma­tis­ing since the nose swab is pretty un­pleas­ant,” said Prof Teo.</p>
    <p>It could be pos­si­ble to use rapid tests, per­haps two to three times ev­ery fort­night, to per­form the same sur­veil­lance, he noted.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause the cost of some of these rapid tests is lower, a higher fre­quency of test­ing may still be less costly than the PCR swab test – and cer­tainly, if there is suf­fi­cient de­mand, the price will also drop.”</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can med­i­cal tech­nol­ogy com­pany Bec­ton Dick­in­son (BD) has de­vel­oped a rapid test for Covid-19 that has ob­tained pro­vi­sional ap­proval from HSA.</p>
    <p>Its BD Ver­i­tor Sars-CoV-2 Rapid Anti­gen test can de­tect an in­fec­tion within 15 min­utes, said its spokesman, who added that ev­ery test has its pros and cons.</p>
    <p>PCR tests are costly, re­quire skilled molec­u­lar tech­ni­cians and take a longer time to yield re­sults. Their ro­bust­ness also de­pends on the seg­ment of the vi­ral ge­netic ma­te­rial be­ing flagged.</p>
    <p>Rapid tests can com­ple­ment PCR tests, not re­place them, as dif­fer­ent tests are ap­pro­pri­ate for use at dif­fer­ent times, the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing rapid anti­gen tests at point-of-care set­tings... com­ple­ments PCR test­ing, al­lows hos­pi­tals and lab­o­ra­to­ries to pri­ori­tise their PCR tests for ur­gent cases and not over­bur­den the lab­o­ra­tory sys­tem,” he added.</p>
