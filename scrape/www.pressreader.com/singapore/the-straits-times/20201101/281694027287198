    <p>NICE (France) • French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron told Arab broad­caster Al-Jazeera yes­ter­day that he un­der­stood Mus­lim feel­ings to­wards car­toons of Prophet Muham­mad and ex­plained that his re­marks have been dis­torted to look as if he is sup­port­ive of of­fen­sive car­i­ca­tures of the Prophet.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron had pledged to crack down on Is­lamist rad­i­cals and said France would not “give up” the car­i­ca­tures last Wed­nes­day at a memo­rial ser­vice for Mr Sa­muel Paty, a school teacher in a Paris sub­urb who was be­headed by an 18-yearold Chechen on Oct 16.</p>
    <p>Mr Paty had shown his stu­dents car­toons of Prophet Muham­mad in a class on free­dom of ex­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>Many Mus­lims across the world were out­raged by Mr Macron, who was seen to be de­fend­ing the of­fen­sive car­i­ca­tures. And on Thurs­day, a Tu­nisian Mus­lim mi­grant killed three peo­ple in a ter­ror at­tack on a church in Nice.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron, who had ear­lier said Is­lam faced a “cri­sis”, told AlJazeera that his car­i­ca­ture re­marks have been dis­torted to make it ap­pear as though he sup­ports the car­toons, which he said were pub­lished by in­de­pen­dent me­dia.</p>
    <p>France is fac­ing calls across the</p>
    <p>Mus­lim world for a boy­cott of its prod­ucts, while Turk­ish Pres­i­dent Re­cep Tayyip Er­do­gan said the French leader needs to un­dergo a men­tal ex­am­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>In Pak­istan, Bangladesh and the Pales­tinian ter­ri­to­ries, tens of thou­sands of Mus­lims staged an­tiFrench protests af­ter Fri­day prayers.</p>
    <p>In Is­lam­abad, po­lice briefly fired tear gas at protesters who broke through se­cu­rity block­ades in a failed at­tempt to demon­strate at the French em­bassy.</p>
    <p>In Bangladesh, marchers in the cap­i­tal Dhaka chanted “Boy­cott French prod­ucts” and car­ried ban­ners call­ing Mr Macron “the world’s big­gest ter­ror­ist”. Protests also took place in In­dia, Le­banon and So­ma­lia.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo yes­ter­day con­demned what he called “ter­ror­ist” at­tacks in France, but warned that free­dom of speech that in­jures the “sa­cred val­ues and sym­bol of re­li­gion is so wrong” and “shouldn’t be jus­ti­fied”.</p>
    <p>Cana­dian Prime Min­is­ter Justin Trudeau de­fended free speech on Fri­day, but said it should not “ar­bi­trar­ily and need­lessly hurt” peo­ple with whom “we are shar­ing a so­ci­ety and a planet”.</p>
    <p>French au­thor­i­ties said that they ex­pected more at­tacks on France and any sym­bol of the repub­lic or Chris­tian­ity was a po­ten­tial tar­get.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of soldiers were de­ployed to pro­tect places of wor­ship and schools as the na­tion was at its high­est level of se­cu­rity alert.</p>
