    <p>TOKYO • In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC) pres­i­dent Thomas Bach yes­ter­day said that while par­tic­i­pat­ing ath­letes will not be forced to get Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tions, should they be­come avail­able, ahead of the Tokyo Olympics it would be highly prefer­able as a “demon­stra­tion of sol­i­dar­ity” with the Ja­panese peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“We will en­cour­age ath­letes that when­ever pos­si­ble they have the vac­ci­na­tion be­cause it is bet­ter for their health, and it is also a demon­stra­tion of sol­i­dar­ity with their fel­low ath­letes and also the Ja­panese peo­ple,” said the Ger­man, who vis­ited the Ath­letes’ Vil­lage be­fore con­clud­ing his two-day Tokyo trip with a visit to the Na­tional Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>The 66-year-old, how­ever, claimed vac­ci­na­tion would be a “free de­ci­sion” for all those in­volved in the Games.</p>
    <p>“There are too many is­sues to con­sider. This is a ques­tion of pri­vate health,” he said. “It is a ques­tion also of (the) health con­di­tions of each and ev­ery per­son. It’s a ques­tion of avail­abil­ity.”</p>
    <p>Bach’s trip, his first to Ja­pan since the un­prece­dented de­ci­sion to post­pone the Games in March, has been up­beat through­out and he has spo­ken about the great im­pact a vac­cine could have on Tokyo’s abil­ity to host the Olympics next year.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Health Min­is­ter Greg Hunt yes­ter­day said that the IOC had re­as­sured him “they have moved to se­cure vac­cines for all ath­letes and of­fi­cials who would be at­tend­ing from around the world”.</p>
    <p>This is in line with Bach’s state­ment on Mon­day that the body will ar­range to en­sure vac­ci­na­tion of both ath­letes and vis­i­tors be­fore they ar­rive in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>More than 11,000 ath­letes are ex­pected to de­scend upon Tokyo for the Olympics, which are due to be­gin on July 23, with thou­sands more com­ing for the sub­se­quent Par­a­lympics.</p>
    <p>But when pressed whether ath­letes were go­ing to jump the queue to get any po­ten­tial vac­cine be­fore the Games, Bach was adamant this would not be the case.</p>
    <p>“We made it clear from the very be­gin­ning that the first pri­or­i­ties are for the nurses, med­i­cal doc­tors and ev­ery­body who keeps our so­ci­ety alive, de­spite the coro­n­avirus crisis,” he told re­porters at the Na­tional Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese are the peo­ple who de­serve to be the first ones to be vac­ci­nated.”</p>
    <p>Tokyo 2020 or­gan­is­ers are hold­ing a pro­ject re­view meet­ing later this week and hope to de­cide on a range of Covid-19 counter-mea­sures, in­clud­ing whether spec­ta­tors will be al­lowed in venues next year.</p>
    <p>But sec­tions of the pub­lic re­main scep­ti­cal amid the ris­ing num­ber of cases, with the coun­try record­ing over 1,000 daily in­fec­tions for the past week.</p>
    <p>A small group of anti-Olympics pro­test­ers gath­ered out­side the sta­dium dur­ing Bach’s visit, and their chanted slo­gans could be heard as he walked alone down the running track and looked up at the empty seats sur­round­ing him.</p>
