    <p>China’s ser­vices sec­tor ac­tiv­ity ex­panded at a slower pace last month, a pri­vate sec­tor sur­vey showed yes­ter­day, as spo­radic coro­n­avirus out­breaks tem­pered the re­cov­ery in con­sumer con­fi­dence and weighed on new busi­ness growth.</p>
    <p>The Caixin/Markit ser­vices Pur­chas­ing Man­agers’ In­dex (PMI) eased last month to 56.3, a three-month low, from 57.8 in Novem­ber, but re­mained well above the 50-mark that sep­a­rates growth from con­trac­tion on a monthly ba­sis, point­ing to brisk ex­pan­sion.</p>
    <p>A sub-in­dex for new busi­ness stood at 54.3, down markedly from 58.7 the pre­vi­ous month, the sur­vey showed.</p>
    <p>Growth in new ex­port busi­ness, which re­turned to ex­pan­sion only in Novem­ber, eased as a surg­ing pan­demic re­strained overseas de­mand.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey also re­vealed a fur­ther sharp rise in in­put prices, which led firms to in­crease their prices charged at the fastest pace since Jan­u­ary 2008.</p>
    <p>The loss of mo­men­tum was largely in line with the find­ings in an of­fi­cial sur­vey re­leased last week, which showed that ac­tiv­ity for the cater­ing in­dus­try had con­tracted.</p>
    <p>The ser­vices sec­tor, which had been slower to re­cover ini­tially than the in­dus­trial sec­tor, is more vul­ner­a­ble to so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions as the au­thor­i­ties race to tackle dozens of Covid-19 cases in north­ern China, in­clud­ing places such as Bei­jing, as well as He­bei and Liaon­ing prov­inces.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese tourists, mil­lions of whom have shunned overseas travel be­cause of the global pan­demic, are fur­ther nar­row­ing the scope of their jour­neys, vis­it­ing nearby ci­ties and avoid­ing trips out of their prov­inces.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Chi­nese ser­vices firms re­mained op­ti­mistic about the year ahead amid hopes of an end to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness ex­pec­ta­tions over the next 12 months shot to the high­est since April 2011, the sur­vey showed.</p>
    <p>Caixin’s com­pos­ite man­u­fac­tur­ing and ser­vices PMI, also re­leased yes­ter­day, nudged lower to 55.8 last month, from 57.5 the pre­vi­ous month, also partly due to the drag in the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor.</p>
    <p>“Look­ing ahead, we ex­pect the post-epi­demic eco­nomic re­cov­ery to con­tinue for sev­eral months, and macroe­co­nomic in­di­ca­tors will be stronger over the next six months due to the low bases in the first half of 2020,” said Mr Wang Zhe, se­nior economist at Caixin In­sight Group, in a state­ment ac­com­pa­ny­ing the data re­lease.</p>
    <p>“Mean­while, we need to pay at­ten­tion to the mount­ing pres­sure on costs brought by the in­crease in raw ma­te­rial prices and its ad­verse im­pact on em­ploy­ment, which is par­tic­u­larly im­por­tant to fig­ur­ing out how to exit the stim­u­lus poli­cies im­ple­mented dur­ing the epi­demic,” he said.</p>
