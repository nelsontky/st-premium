    <p>•</p>
    <p>Chelsea recorded a profit of £32.5 mil­lion (S$58 mil­lion) in the last fi­nan­cial year de­spite the eco­nomic im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic, the Premier League club said.</p>
    <p>The Blues said turnover for the year ended June 30, 2020 was £407.4 mil­lion, down from £446.7 mil­lion in the pre­vi­ous year.</p>
    <p>But the west Lon­don club were able to post a profit off the back of their qual­i­fi­ca­tion for the Cham­pi­ons League and money made from player sales.</p>
    <p>Chelsea sold Bel­gian winger Eden Haz­ard to Real Madrid last sum­mer in a deal worth a re­ported €100 mil­lion (S$161 mil­lion) and also off­loaded Ola Aina (€9.8m), To­mas Kalas (€9m) and David Luiz (€8.7m) among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Broad­cast­ing rev­enues de­creased by £17.6 mil­lion, while match­day rev­enues fell £12.2 mil­lion due to the sus­pen­sion of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>But the im­pact of the pan­demic was par­tially off­set by re­duced match­day costs due to the post­pone­ment of fix­tures.</p>
    <p>Chelsea also said they were on track to post a record profit and record turnover had the pan­demic not hit their fi­nances.</p>
    <p>“In com­mon with many busi­nesses, the pan­demic has had a sig­nif­i­cant im­pact on Chelsea’s in­come, but it is a sign of the strength and sta­bil­ity of our fi­nan­cial op­er­a­tion that the com­pany was still able to post a profit,” chair­man Bruce Buck said.</p>
    <p>“De­spite the im­pact of Covid, the rev­enue streams re­mained strong, our team is de­vel­op­ing on the pitch and the club is in a good po­si­tion to con­tinue to grow when foot­ball is able to op­er­ate as it did pre­vi­ously.”</p>
    <p>Chelsea, who have 26 points from 16 games, host Manch­ester City to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>City, also on 26 points, have two games in hand af­ter Mon­day’s match at Ever­ton was post­poned due to a Covid-19 out­break at their club.</p>
    <p>Their first team have since re­turned to train­ing af­ter their fa­cil­i­ties were closed for two days but the league has yet to resched­ule the game against Ever­ton.</p>
    <p>Pep Guardi­ola’s City will be chas­ing their third suc­ces­sive league win.</p>
    <p>Chelsea need to turn around a run of poor form that in­cludes three de­feats and a draw in their last five games.</p>
