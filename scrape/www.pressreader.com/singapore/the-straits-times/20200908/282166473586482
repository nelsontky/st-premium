    <p>It was rather quiet on the Sin­ga­pore bourse – as was the case in many other Asian mar­kets yes­ter­day – with the key Straits Times In­dex (STI) fin­ish­ing on a flat note at 2,511.21, up by 1.57 points or 0.06 per cent.</p>
    <p>A wait-and-see stance was the dom­i­nant theme, even as in­vestors breathed a sigh of re­lief that last Thurs­day’s rout in United States tech stocks did not spill over to the fol­low­ing day, with Wall Street clos­ing lower in an or­derly fash­ion.</p>
    <p>That was partly ow­ing to the ab­sence of un­to­ward shocks in the Amer­i­can job data that was re­leased on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The tight-range trad­ing on the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket comes ahead of the Labour Day hol­i­day in the US mar­kets on Mon­day there.</p>
    <p>Key Asian mar­kets put up a mixed show­ing yes­ter­day. Japan was down 0.5 per cent and Hong Kong fell 0.4 per cent. China’s Shang­hai Com­pos­ite lost 1.9 per cent while Malaysia closed 0.3 per cent lower.</p>
    <p>But South Korea and Aus­tralia eked out gains of 0.7 per cent and 0.3 per cent re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Cau­tion per­sisted in the air amid wor­ries of a pan­demic-led global eco­nomic gloom and es­ca­lat­ing USChina rift.</p>
    <p>Over the week­end, the US said it was con­sid­er­ing cut­ting trade with China’s largest chip­maker SMIC, threat­en­ing to es­ca­late Wash­ing­ton’s tech war against China.</p>
    <p>In the com­modi­ties space, oil prices hit their low­est since July, af­ter Saudi Ara­bia cut prices as the coro­n­avirus con­tin­ued to sap en­ergy de­mand.</p>
    <p>Later this week, Malaysia’s Bank Ne­gara, Bank of Canada and Euro­pean Cen­tral Bank will hold pol­icy meet­ings and are largely ex­pected to keep rates steady.</p>
    <p>Trad­ing vol­ume in the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket to­talled 1.32 bil­lion shares worth $780.8 mil­lion, with 11 coun­ters up and 15 down among the STI stocks.</p>
    <p>Gains were led by OCBC as well as Cap­i­taLand Com­mer­cial Trust (CCT) and Cap­i­taLand Mall Trust (CMT), which added five in­dex points to the STI.</p>
    <p>CCT units ended the day higher, by 2.4 per cent to $1.69; CMT jumped 2.6 per cent to $1.98.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, CMT and CCT an­nounced deal sweet­en­ers for their pro­posed merger with an ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ing now fixed for Sept 29. May­bank Kim-Eng has a “buy” rat­ing on CMT over im­prov­ing sec­tor fun­da­men­tals and un­de­mand­ing val­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>StarHub closed un­changed at $1.18. The telco and M1 were fined by the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity over dis­rup­tions to their broad­band In­ter­net services in April and May re­spec­tively.</p>
