    <p>There is some­thing un­ut­ter­ably sump­tu­ous about black and gold. These shades give newly re­opened bou­tique ho­tel Dux­ton Re­serve a dash of old-world glam­our.</p>
    <p>The ho­tel, in a row of re­stored her­itage shop­houses, was for­merly Six Senses Dux­ton, which opened in 2018 and closed dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod. Its owner, The Gar­cha Group, has since re­opened it and its sis­ter ho­tel, The Maxwell Re­serve, un­der Mar­riott’s Au­to­graph Col­lec­tion range.</p>
    <p>The new ho­tel re­tains the stun­ning aes­thetic by Bri­tish hotelier and in­te­rior de­signer Anouska Hem­pel, who is feted for her 1970s work on London’s Blakes Ho­tel, con­sid­ered one of the world’s first lux­ury bou­tique ho­tels.</p>
    <p>Ms Hem­pel is also a for­mer Bond girl – she ap­peared as one of the An­gels of Death in On Her Majesty’s Se­cret Ser­vice (1969) – and the stylish in­te­rior of Dux­ton Re­serve feels like it could pass off as the op­u­lent back­drop to one of 007’s evenings of der­ring-do.</p>
    <p>Huge golden fans and black lac­quer screens line the long hall that is restau­rant Yel­low Pot.</p>
    <p>Helmed by chef Se­bas­tian Goh, it de­liv­ers modern Chi­nese cook­ing – from de­lec­ta­ble lion’s mane mush­rooms with av­o­cado puree to the clean flavours of bar­ra­mundi in house­made fish stock. A la carte break­fast is also served here in the morn­ings – the chilli crab omelette is es­pe­cially rec­om­mended.</p>
    <p>The lu­mi­nous Anouska’s Bar, named for its glam­orous de­signer, serves clas­sic cock­tails with a Chi­nese twist – such as the Chen Pi Collins, a Tom Collins with man­darin-in­fused gin; or the Dux­ton Mary, a Bloody Mary laced with orange and hua diao wine.</p>
    <p>Else­where in the ho­tel, eclec­tic ele­ments pop up around each cor­ner – from the old-school tele­phones in the cor­ri­dors to the wall­pa­per, based on 18th-cen­tury English prop­erty in­den­ture doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>His­toric shop­houses give one lit­tle wig­gle room, but the el­e­gant screens and dark curves of Ms Hem­pel’s de­sign grant nar­row spa­ces an in­ti­mate mys­tique.</p>
    <p>My du­plex suite is fur­nished with a small for­est of stand­ing lamps and a spi­ral stair­case that leads up to the loft bed.</p>
    <p>I am de­lighted be­cause I love spi­ral stair­cases. If you are, how­ever, the sort who hates tramp­ing up and down steps to get your phone charger or switch off the said stand­ing lamps be­fore bed, opt for a ba­sic Shop­house Room or the Mont­gomerie Ex­ec­u­tive Club Suite which, at 51 sq m, is the largest room.</p>
    <p>I while away the af­ter­noon wan­der­ing Dux­ton, a district once rife with KTV bars and ladies of the night that has re­gen­tri­fied in the past decade.</p>
    <p>To­day, up­mar­ket bou­tiques and eater­ies sit cheek by jowl with the likes of the 124-year-old Say Tian Hng Bud­dha Shop, which makes Taoist ef­fi­gies.</p>
    <p>Dux­ton Re­serve is within walk­ing dis­tance of two lovely in­de­pen­dent book­stores – Lit­tered With Books across the street and Chi­nese-lan­guage stal­wart Grassroots Book Room in Bukit Pa­soh Road.</p>
    <p>A few doors down from the ho­tel is be­spoke per­fumery Mai­son 21G, which cre­ated the ho­tel’s sig­na­ture scent La Re­serve – an en­chant­ing pot­pourri of am­ber, oud, patchouli and a dash of ginger.</p>
    <p>I pop in for a work­shop with founder Jo­hanna Mo­nange, 45, who leads me through a dizzy­ing spec­trum of scents – from re­fresh­ing sage to the jaw-drop­pingly ex­pen­sive or­ris, which is made from iris rhi­zomes that are dried over years and which can fetch more than €50,000 (S$80,750) a kilo­gram.</p>
    <p>As I watch, she mixes up a bot­tle of La Re­serve in Mai­son 21G’s in­house ma­chine La Source, some­thing like an espresso ma­chine, only with per­fume car­tridges.</p>
    <p>The scent of it lingers long af­ter I have un­packed back home. Dux­ton Re­serve cer­tainly knows how to leave an im­pres­sion.</p>
