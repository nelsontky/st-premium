    <p>BEI­JING • China’s new lo­cally trans­mit­ted cases of Covid-19 fell to a one-month low as a clus­ter in the west­ern re­gion of Xin­jiang re­ceded, data re­leased by the coun­try’s health au­thor­ity yes­ter­day showed.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of lo­cal trans­mis­sions in China dropped to four on Satur­day, all of which were in Xin­jiang, the Na­tional Health Com­mis­sion said in a state­ment. That com­pares with eight na­tion­wide a day ear­lier, and is the low­est since July 16.</p>
    <p>No new lo­cally trans­mit­ted cases were recorded on Satur­day in the city of Shen­zhen in south­ern Guang­dong province, after the pro­vin­cial au­thor­i­ties there re­ported fresh in­fec­tions a day ear­lier.</p>
    <p>A woman who worked at an Alibaba-owned su­per­mar­ket chain in Shen­zhen had re­turned to her home town of Lufeng and tested pos­i­tive for the virus last Fri­day. Both cities are in Guang­dong.</p>
    <p>On the same day, Lufeng also re­ported three asymp­to­matic cases, while Shen­zhen re­ported two asymp­to­matic car­ri­ers.</p>
    <p>Asymp­to­matic cases test pos­i­tive for the virus, but China does not clas­sify them as con­firmed cases un­til they show clin­i­cal symp­toms of in­fec­tion such as fever or cough.</p>
    <p>In main­land China, the to­tal num­ber of new con­firmed in­fec­tions stood at 19 on Satur­day, in­clud­ing im­ported cases in­volv­ing trav­ellers ar­riv­ing from abroad. That com­pares with 22 a day ear­lier. As of Satur­day, main­land China had 84,827 con­firmed coro­n­avirus cases. The death toll re­mained un­changed at 4,634.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, data from clin­i­cal tri­als pub­lished in The Jour­nal of the Amer­i­can Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion showed that an in­ac­ti­vated vac­cine can­di­date de­vel­oped by China is safe and gen­er­ates an im­mune re­sponse. An in­ac­ti­vated vac­cine con­sists of virus par­ti­cles or pathogens that have been grown un­der con­trolled con­di­tions. The virus is then killed to re­duce its vir­u­lence.</p>
    <p>The re­search pa­per pro­vided an in­terim anal­y­sis of the phase one and phase two clin­i­cal tri­als of an in­ac­ti­vated vac­cine de­vel­oped by the Wuhan In­sti­tute of Bi­o­log­i­cal Prod­ucts un­der the China Na­tional Biotec Group, af­fil­i­ated to Sinopharm, and the Wuhan In­sti­tute of Virol­ogy un­der the Chi­nese Academy of Sciences.</p>
    <p>The re­search in­volved data on 320 healthy vol­un­teers aged be­tween 18 and 59, of which 96 par­tic­i­pated in phase one clin­i­cal tri­als and 224 par­tic­i­pated in phase two.</p>
    <p>The re­search re­ported con­cen­tra­tions of neu­tral­is­ing an­ti­bod­ies in the vol­un­teers. The re­sults showed that the vac­cine ef­fec­tively in­duced neu­tral­is­ing an­ti­bod­ies in the vol­un­teers and demon­strated good im­muno­genic­ity – the abil­ity of a sub­stance to trig­ger an im­mune re­sponse.</p>
    <p>The re­search pa­per re­ported that no se­ri­ous ad­verse re­ac­tions were ob­served, with the most com­mon re­ac­tion be­ing pain at the injection site, fol­lowed by fever – both of which were mild and self-lim­it­ing, it said.</p>
