    <p>It was Dec 30, 2019. I had my last clinic ses­sion of the year and pa­tients who came were ea­ger to share their plans and hopes for the com­ing year.</p>
    <p>One of them, Nigel (not his real name), was par­tic­u­larly ex­cited about 2020. Af­ter work­ing in his com­pany for al­most a decade, he was fi­nally go­ing to be put up for a pro­mo­tion. He was also ex­pect­ing his first child in a few months. He jok­ingly said 2020 would be a year of dou­ble bless­ings for him.</p>
    <p>Barely a month later, Sin­ga­pore re­ported its first im­ported Covid-19 case. By March, flash es­ti­mates showed that the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy had con­tracted by 2.2 per cent year-on-year in the first quar­ter, the worst per­for­mance since the 2009 global fi­nan­cial crisis.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, Nigel did not get his pro­mo­tion.</p>
    <p>On April 7, Sin­ga­pore en­tered its first cir­cuit breaker pe­riod in his­tory, where only es­sen­tial ser­vices were avail­able. His wife lost her job and he suf­fered a huge pay cut.</p>
    <p>His son was born a few weeks later, which helped put a tem­po­rary halt to all the stress and un­hap­pi­ness at home.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the break was short-lived and there was a lot of con­flict be­tween him and his wife.</p>
    <p>Last month, as Sin­ga­pore slowly re­opened, some nor­mal­ity re­sumed in their lives as he re­turned to work. How­ever, he strug­gled to get his life back on track in this “new nor­mal”.</p>
    <p>THE SCI­ENCE BE­HIND THE STRESS</p>
    <p>The late psy­chol­o­gist Richard Lazarus had in the 1960s ex­plained that stress is not about the prob­lems one may have, but the re­sult of how well one can cope with the prob­lems.</p>
    <p>Hence, it is im­por­tant to im­prove the way we think and do things in or­der to bet­ter han­dle stress.</p>
    <p>Oth­er­wise, the chronic­ity of stress can re­sult in po­ten­tial phys­i­cal and men­tal health com­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>When ini­tially faced with an acute crisis, it is our nat­u­ral in­stinct to de­ploy our usual cop­ing mech­a­nisms.</p>
    <p>This may in­clude emo­tional cop­ing, such as be­ing in de­nial, ex­press­ing anger and cry­ing; or be­havioural cop­ing, such as binge-eat­ing, avoid­ance of the sit­u­a­tion, con­fid­ing in oth­ers and prob­lem-solv­ing. All th­ese strate­gies lie on a spec­trum of ef­fec­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>In Nigel’s case, one of his main cop­ing mech­a­nisms is com­fort eat­ing, which has helped him through sev­eral stress­ful pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>If he had had a ma­jor ar­gu­ment with his wife, he would also avoid talk­ing to her un­til they were both calm.</p>
    <p>As such cop­ing mech­a­nisms are of­ten de­ployed at a sub­con­scious level, we tend to over­look the need to ques­tion their ef­fec­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>In an acute crisis, when the ex­po­sure pe­riod is short, the use of less healthy and ef­fec­tive mech­a­nisms can still work be­cause the crisis will be over be­fore the neg­a­tive ef­fects start to show.</p>
    <p>In a pro­longed crisis, th­ese strate­gies may not be ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>For Nigel, it be­came clear that his meth­ods of binge-eat­ing and avoid­ance would not work in the months ahead. It was time to change and con­sider other op­tions.</p>
    <p>So, Nigel and I ex­plored other health­ier and more sus­tain­able ways to cope with his stress.</p>
    <p>There are many re­sources avail­able, such as the Na­tional Care Hot­line (call 6202-6868 or go to www.mind­line.sg). The key lies in mak­ing them work for you.</p>
    <p>Nigel is seden­tary and in­tro­verted, so he finds sug­gested meth­ods like ex­er­cis­ing and con­fid­ing in oth­ers dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>So we mod­i­fied th­ese meth­ods. He would go on evening walks in­stead of do­ing stren­u­ous ex­er­cise and he started on­line coun­selling ses­sions, both of which he found eas­ier than the orig­i­nal meth­ods.</p>
    <p>Forc­ing your­self to do some­thing you do not en­joy will be coun­ter­pro­duc­tive in help­ing you deal with stress.</p>
    <p>FO­CUS ON WHAT YOU CAN CON­TROL</p>
    <p>I en­cour­aged Nigel to think back on what he had been try­ing to do for the past six months and re­flect on the things which were within his con­trol, as well as those which were not.</p>
    <p>In a crisis, when things are un­cer­tain, we nat­u­rally want to be pre­pared for the many “what ifs”: what if there will be another cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, what if sales do not pick up or what if a new job can­not be found.</p>
    <p>How­ever, this de­sire to con­trol the un­ex­pected and un­con­trol­lable of­ten leads to men­tal paral­y­sis, which back­fires and stops us from do­ing what we can and need to do.</p>
    <p>Only when we ac­cept that there are things be­yond our con­trol are we able to move on and fo­cus on what we can do, such as do­ing our best at work and spend­ing time with our fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>This is sim­i­lar in con­cept to Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong’s point about ac­cept­ing a new nor­mal.</p>
    <p>We need to pre­pare our­selves men­tally and plan our so­cial and per­sonal re­sources ac­cord­ingly. The men­tal prepa­ra­tion needed for a 100m dash is dif­fer­ent from that for a 42km marathon.</p>
    <p>We need to ac­knowl­edge that Covid-19 is go­ing to be a marathon, which we will over­come even­tu­ally as a na­tion.</p>
    <p>For now, we need to pace our­selves to pre­vent burnout, adopt ap­pro­pri­ate strate­gies to make it an eas­ier jour­ney and look out for one another.</p>
