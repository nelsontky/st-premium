    <p>As a long-time fol­lower of the ath­let­ics scene in Sin­ga­pore, I am stunned that Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics’ (SA) out­go­ing man­age­ment com­mit­tee kicked off – on the last day of its ten­ure – dis­ci­plinary pro­ceed­ings against marathoner Soh Rui Yong (Soh charged over posts, Sept 28).</p>
    <p>I am puz­zled that Soh was ac­cused of breach­ing the code of con­duct as early as Aug 2 last year, and then was said to have done so again on a few oc­ca­sions till Jan 17 be­fore Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics fi­nally took him to task last week. Shouldn’t Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics have acted ear­lier in Au­gust last year when the breaches first be­gan?</p>
    <p>To me, Soh, a two-time SEA Games marathon gold medal­list, is some­what of a mav­er­ick and should be treated dif­fer­ently, even though I do not agree with some of his an­tics.</p>
    <p>I also can­not rec­on­cile Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>Ath­let­ics’ lat­est ac­tion against him with the farewell mes­sage by out­go­ing pres­i­dent Tang Weng Fei to the ath­let­ics com­mu­nity just a few days be­fore.</p>
    <p>He said: “SA’s pri­or­ity should al­ways be our ath­letes” (Hum­bled, grate­ful to win, Sept 26).</p>
    <p>The out­go­ing SA man­age­ment com­mit­tee has made a mess of its re­la­tion­ship with ath­letes and coaches, and is now pass­ing on one more mess to the new com­mit­tee to deal with.</p>
    <p>Newly elected Lien Choong</p>
    <p>Luen and his team will in­deed have a chal­leng­ing term ahead, and the com­mu­nity should wish them well.</p>
