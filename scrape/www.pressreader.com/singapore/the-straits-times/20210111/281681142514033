    <p>MEL­BOURNE • Aus­tralia’s New South Wales (NSW) state recorded three new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, as a three-week lock­down for about a quar­ter of a mil­lion peo­ple in Syd­ney’s north­ern beach sub­urbs was eased.</p>
    <p>NSW Premier Gla­dys Bere­jik­lian said masks in public places and on trans­port will re­main manda­tory for greater Syd­ney, and some public gath­er­ing re­stric­tions will con­tinue as the re­cent out­break of the pan­demic there still poses risks.</p>
    <p>“It only takes one or two cases to get out of con­trol or (an) un­de­tected line of trans­mis­sion to get out of con­trol for all of us to be in a sit­u­a­tion where we have to con­sider mak­ing things tighter,” she said at a press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>NSW state and Syd­ney, Aus­tralia’s largest city, have been iso­lated from the rest of the coun­try by state border clo­sures or 14-day manda­tory quar­an­tine rules for in­ter-state ar­rivals from NSW, fol­low­ing a mid-De­cem­ber out­break.</p>
    <p>There were no new cases re­ported yes­ter­day in ei­ther Vic­to­ria or Queens­land, both of which share borders with NSW.</p>
    <p>Bris­bane, the cap­i­tal of Queens­land, was mid­way through its three-day strict lock­down yes­ter­day after the dis­cov­ery of a sin­gle case of the vir­u­lent Bri­tain-linked coro­n­avirus vari­ant.</p>
    <p>Bris­bane’s case, the first time the highly trans­mis­si­ble vari­ant linked to Bri­tain was recorded in a com­mu­nity in Aus­tralia, and sev­eral other cases of the new vari­ant recorded in man­aged ho­tel quar­an­tine have put the coun­try on high alert.</p>
    <p>Thanks to strict and swift mea­sures, high rates of com­mu­nity com­pli­ance and ag­gres­sive test­ing and trac­ing, Aus­tralia has been more suc­cess­ful than most ad­vanced economies in man­ag­ing the pan­demic, with to­tal in­fec­tions at around 28,600 and 909 deaths so far.</p>
