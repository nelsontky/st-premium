    <p>A man who re­moved his mask and coughed at a su­per­mar­ket crowd con­troller amid the Covid-19 out­break was jailed for five weeks yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean Tan Shiaw Wee, who was free of the in­fec­tion, com­mit­ted the of­fence af­ter he spot­ted Ms Ng Poh Wei par­tially re­move her mask for a few sec­onds to wipe per­spi­ra­tion off her face.</p>
    <p>Tan, 47, pleaded guilty on July 28 to one charge each of ha­rass­ment and an of­fence un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act.</p>
    <p>One count of us­ing crim­i­nal force was con­sid­ered dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Ng, 52, was work­ing at the en­trance of the Sheng Siong su­per­mar­ket at Block 451 Bukit Ba­tok West Av­enue 6 at around 8am on April 22 when Tan with­drew cash from an ATM nearby.</p>
    <p>He no­ticed that Ms Ng had par­tially re­moved her mask to wipe her face and scolded her.</p>
    <p>Tan then picked up a hand sani­tiser bot­tle meant for su­per­mar­ket cus­tomers and sprayed her sev­eral times be­fore walk­ing away.</p>
    <p>Ms Ng said she would take Tan’s pho­to­graph and alert the police.</p>
    <p>Tan, who over­heard this, ap­proached her, re­moved his mask and coughed at her once be­fore leav­ing.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Nor­man Yew had ear­lier said: “The vic­tim felt the cough and be­came alarmed and scared that she might be in­fected with Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments did not state how the au­thor­i­ties found Tan.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Dis­trict Judge Christo­pher Goh said that it was “very un­for­tu­nate” that Tan had let “some­thing triv­ial” get the bet­ter of him.</p>
    <p>He could have been jailed for up to six months and fined up to $5,000 for the ha­rass­ment charge.</p>
    <p>A first-time of­fender can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $10,000 for a charge un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act.</p>
    <p>A re­peat of­fender can be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $20,000.</p>
