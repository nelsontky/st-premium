    <p>Usu­ally at this time of the year, my wife and I would be well on our way to some­where far, far away in quest of some rest­ful peace and quiet.</p>
    <p>It did not mat­ter all that much pre­cisely where, but my pref­er­ence was gen­er­ally for some place with fresh alpine air, a change of pace and stun­ning scenery.</p>
    <p>This is not hap­pen­ing, of course, this year. The grim re­ports of a surge of in­fec­tions and deaths from Covid-19 from Seoul to San Fran­cisco to Stock­holm mean that for many peo­ple around the world, Christ­mas will lit­er­ally en­tail some si­lent nights. Height­ened re­stric­tions and lock­downs will leave many long­ing for deliveranc­e from the dreaded bug.</p>
    <p>Deal­ing daily with sober­ing re­ports on the pan­demic is enough to put any­one in an un­sea­son­ably som­bre mood, with dark thoughts de­scend­ing in­evitably over just what it is all about.</p>
    <p>Thank­fully, I was jolted out of such a pen­sive mood one evening last week by a col­league.</p>
    <p>His mes­sage came via e-mail, since work­ing from home and so­cial dis­tanc­ing have meant that he could no longer saunter up to me in the news­room for a chat, as he was wont to do.</p>
    <p>“What are you thank­ful for this year?” he asked, adding that this was re­search for a piece he was writ­ing. “Please re­ply, even if briefly.”</p>
    <p>His ques­tion sent my mind off on a dif­fer­ent track, for which I was grate­ful.</p>
    <p>What’s the point in wor­ry­ing and wal­low­ing over what we can’t and don’t have?</p>
    <p>Phase three is com­ing, at last, on Dec 28. Yet, some are lament­ing that the lift­ing of re­stric­tions is all too lit­tle and too late.</p>
    <p>But was it not this grad­ual step-by-cau­tious-step ap­proach that en­abled us to en­joy this pe­riod of rel­a­tive safety? Un­like in so many places else­where, peo­ple here can go about their lives, heading out to work, ex­er­cise or shop. Restau­rants are full and ho­tels are busy, with peo­ple mak­ing the most of be­ing at home, even as re­stric­tions on nightlife and travel re­main.</p>
    <p>Vac­cines have been de­vel­oped and are be­ing de­ployed at un­prece­dented speed, a tri­umph of hu­man will and in­ge­nu­ity. Yet, some are spread­ing fears about the down­sides and risks. Th­ese do need to be tracked and man­aged. But would th­ese naysay­ers have been hap­pier if sci­en­tists had not per­formed their amaz­ing feat of find­ing a much-needed so­lu­tion to the cri­sis so quickly?</p>
    <p>Pon­der­ing th­ese ques­tions, I re­solved there and then that this year, I shall spend the 12 days of Christ­mas giv­ing thanks for the things that I have and should be thank­ful for. One grate­ful thought for each day, with each one build­ing on the other, you know, just as in the fa­mil­iar carol about those call­ing birds, tur­tle doves and a par­tridge in a pear tree.</p>
    <p>I share th­ese thoughts with you in the hope of spread­ing some sea­sonal good­will and cheer, as well as invit­ing you to think about your own thanks­giv­ing list.</p>
    <p>Here’s mine:</p>
    <p>1. LIFE</p>
    <p>In a year when mil­lions have been af­flicted, and many have suc­cumbed, it is fit­ting to be­gin with giv­ing thanks for life it­self, recog­nis­ing how pre­cious and pre­car­i­ous it can be. Of­ten, in the mind­less busy­ness of our days, we ne­glect be­ing grate­ful for the won­drous gift of life, ours and that of those around us.</p>
    <p>2. LOVE</p>
    <p>Sep­a­ra­tion, im­posed sud­denly and some­what ar­bi­trar­ily, through the year, should force us to ap­pre­ci­ate those who love us, and to cher­ish them for do­ing so. That’s surely bet­ter than the vac­u­ous pur­suit of “likes” and “friends” on so­cial me­dia, that er­satz es­ti­mate of hu­man con­nec­tions and their last­ing value.</p>
    <p>3. LIBERTY</p>
    <p>The free­dom to come and go, where and when you will, to have and to hold, whomever you choose. In a year when pre­vi­ously unimag­in­able rules had to be made, and en­forced, we might well value our erst­while free­doms. So­cial dis­tanc­ing, wear­ing a mask, move­ment con­trols, cur­fews and other re­stric­tions are un­nat­u­ral, even if they are nec­es­sary for now. Be­ing so­cial creatures, my guess is that as soon as we can, most peo­ple will want to re­sume as­so­ci­at­ing phys­i­cally, not just vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>4. LOCK­DOWN</p>
    <p>This might seem odd, given the mas­sive dis­rup­tion that lock­downs im­posed on all our lives. Painful as it was at the time, they did force many to slow down, re­think our pri­or­i­ties and ques­tion some deeply held as­sump­tions – not least the vi­a­bil­ity of re­mote and flex­i­ble work and the op­por­tu­ni­ties of­fered by dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion – and opened minds to new pos­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>5. LOSS</p>
    <p>Amid the many lives taken by the virus, I mourned the loss of one of my clos­est friends, to can­cer, af­ter a pro­tracted bat­tle, which he bore coura­geously, even cheer­fully, to the end.</p>
    <p>Alone at home dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, I re­flected on the many happy times we had to­gether, be­gin­ning from our school days, two young boys find­ing and fum­bling our way in the world, but al­ways cheer­ing each other on, come what may. I was left pro­foundly thank­ful for his life and his friend­ship.</p>
    <p>6. LABOUR</p>
    <p>Noth­ing causes you to value some­thing more than the prospect of los­ing it. So too for our jobs. That very term re­flects our con­flicted at­ti­tude to­wards it, with its con­no­ta­tions of drudgery, as we plod along on our daily com­mute.</p>
    <p>Yet, when mil­lions have been plunged into un­em­ploy­ment or un­der-em­ploy­ment, face fur­loughs or wage cuts, or find it harder to land a job upon grad­u­a­tion or af­ter re­trench­ment, hav­ing a job is some­thing to be cher­ished. And if, like me, you are one of the happy lot who en­joy their work, and de­rive from it a sense of mean­ing and pur­pose, you are dou­bly blessed.</p>
    <p>7. LEISURE</p>
    <p>Given the eco­nomic changes that the pan­demic has wrought, we are be­ing forced to think about how we will work in the fu­ture. Yet, in do­ing so, per­haps we should also pon­der how we will live.</p>
    <p>How to fill the long days with in­ter­est­ing pur­suits and keep our­selves en­gaged with the world?</p>
    <p>Like it or not, we have all had more time this year to “stand and stare”, and pon­der that haunt­ing ques­tion, “what is this life, if full of care?”</p>
    <p>We have all had it drummed into us that no one owes us a liv­ing. Yes, in­deed. But this year has also made plain that liv­ing is per­haps what we owe our­selves.</p>
    <p>8. LI­BRARIES</p>
    <p>What you wish to fill your days with is a mat­ter of choice and taste, of course. For me, it all be­gins with words.</p>
    <p>Yes, words, lines and lines of them, giv­ing rise to books and li­braries, of both fact and fic­tion, po­etry and prose.</p>
    <p>In the im­posed quiet mo­ments this year, I have delighted in dis­cov­ery, and re­dis­cov­ery, of the joys of read­ing.</p>
    <p>Read­ing can bring both plea­sure and pain, so­lace and respite, knowl­edge and in­sights. Books are gifts that keep giv­ing, shar­ing their wis­dom read­ily and al­low­ing you to also spread this widely. With books, giv­ing is as much a re­ward in it­self.</p>
    <p>In that spirit, my best dis­cov­ery this year was the de­but novel by Amer­i­can au­thor M.L. Rio. Ti­tled If We Were Vil­lains, it is a gripping mur­der mys­tery that takes place at a Shake­speare con­ser­va­tory, en­gulf­ing the lives of a bunch of young ac­tors, who bor­row lines lib­er­ally and skil­fully from the Bard. En­joy.</p>
    <p>9. LUD­WIG</p>
    <p>My old friend, Lud­wig, whom I en­coun­tered, quite by chance, decades ago, turns 250 this year (around this time in De­cem­ber, though no one can tell the pre­cise date).</p>
    <p>I am talk­ing, of course, of Lud­wig van Beethoven, whose 250th birth an­niver­sary is be­ing marked this year, al­beit mostly vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>I had planned, as one of my New Year res­o­lu­tions last De­cem­ber, to try rather hero­ically to lis­ten to all of his works – sym­phonies, con­cer­tos, pi­ano sonatas and string quar­tets, choral and opera pieces, yes, the lot!</p>
    <p>Alas, I have not man­aged to do it all, but it has been quite a jour­ney, with an old com­pan­ion, who is not al­ways easy, some­times de­mand­ing, but al­ways re­ward­ing in the end.</p>
    <p>If you have not heard, or lis­tened to re­cently, the Heiliger Dankge­sang, the third move­ment in his String Quar­tet No. 15, which he wrote in 1825 af­ter a near-fa­tal bout of ill­ness, I com­mend it to you. De­scribed by the com­poser as a “Holy Song of Thanks­giv­ing of a Con­va­les­cent to the De­ity”, it is a per­fect – and up­lift­ing – musical state­ment for th­ese pesti­lent times.</p>
    <p>10. LINES</p>
    <p>The tech­no­log­i­cal won­ders of mod­ern com­mu­ni­ca­tion that en­abled us to stay con­nected even while forced to stay apart. Th­ese made it pos­si­ble to con­nect for work and to stream end­less hours of en­ter­tain­ment, as well as fa­cil­i­tated home de­liv­er­ies of food and other es­sen­tials. Just try to imag­ine what life in this iso­lat­ing year would have been like with­out th­ese life­lines.</p>
    <p>11. LEAD­ERS</p>
    <p>It might not be fash­ion­able to ex­press thanks to any­one in authority th­ese days, but how churl­ish it would be not to ac­knowl­edge what a big dif­fer­ence good gov­er­nance has made to all our lives. Think about the steady, sen­si­ble ap­proach taken here, as op­posed to that seen else­where, where al­ter­na­tive facts and par­al­lel po­lit­i­cal re­al­i­ties have caused so much need­less suf­fer­ing, anx­i­ety and dis­cord.</p>
    <p>At both the na­tional and or­gan­i­sa­tional lev­els, good lead­ers shape out­comes and set the tone. Some try to bluff and boast, bully and bull­doze their way, throw­ing tem­per tantrums that oth­ers down the line have to en­dure. That is no hall­mark of a leader, who is meant to serve, as a hum­ble stew­ard of a shared pur­pose and an en­dur­ing cause.</p>
    <p>12. LAUGH­TER</p>
    <p>The best an­ti­dote to the vi­cis­si­tudes of life, and es­pe­cially needed in th­ese cheer­less times. As Amer­i­can poet Ella Wheeler Wil­cox rightly says: “Laugh, and the world laughs with you; weep, and you weep alone; for the sad old earth must bor­row its mirth, but has trou­ble enough of its own.”</p>
    <p>Cer­tainly there is dark­ness enough all around, and you can shed a lit­tle light, not least by laugh­ing at our fol­lies and foibles, as well as those fatu­ous as­sump­tions we had about the world, which the pan­demic has ex­posed.</p>
    <p>Wil­cox also penned the poem, Thanks­giv­ing.</p>
    <p>Th­ese words of hope and grat­i­tude seem apt at this time, and I of­fer them to you, dear reader, as a lit­tle sea­sonal gift, as I have done be­fore at this time of the year.</p>
    <p>“We walk on starry fields of white And do not see the daisies;</p>
    <p>For bless­ings com­mon in our sight</p>
    <p>We rarely of­fer praises.</p>
    <p>We sigh for some supreme de­light</p>
    <p>To crown our lives with splen­dour,</p>
    <p>And quite ig­nore our daily store Of plea­sures sweet and ten­der.</p>
    <p>Our cares are bold and push their way</p>
    <p>Upon our thought and feel­ing. They hang about us all the day, Our time from plea­sure steal­ing. So un­ob­tru­sive many a joy We pass by and for­get it,</p>
    <p>But worry strives to own our lives</p>
    <p>And con­quers if we let it.</p>
    <p>There’s not a day in all the year But holds some hid­den plea­sure, And look­ing back, joys oft ap­pear To brim the past’s wide mea­sure. But bless­ings are like friends, I hold,</p>
    <p>Who love and labour near us. We ought to raise our notes of praise</p>
    <p>While liv­ing hearts can hear us.</p>
    <p>Full many a bless­ing wears the guise</p>
    <p>Of worry or of trou­ble. Farsee­ing is the soul and wise Who knows the mask is dou­ble. But he who has the faith and strength</p>
    <p>To thank his God for sor­row Has found a joy with­out al­loy To glad­den every mor­row.</p>
    <p>With my sin­cere thanks for keep­ing me com­pany as I thought aloud oc­ca­sion­ally, and for read­ing The Straits Times. And my very best wishes for bet­ter times in the new year.</p>
