    <p>On Dec 31 last year, the world was alerted to the emer­gence of a new virus. Yes­ter­day, Sin­ga­pore rolled out its vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme. Se­nior staff nurse Sarah Lim (be­low) was the first in line, fol­lowed by her Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases col­leagues.</p>
    <p>In a six-page spe­cial, The Straits Times looks at how Sin­ga­pore has ad­justed to the dark clouds of the pan­demic, and how there have also been sil­ver lin­ings.</p>
    <p>• Packed of­fices turn empty, as many work from home</p>
    <p>• With less com­mut­ing, air qual­ity here im­proves</p>
    <p>• Vol­un­teers step up to help those im­pacted</p>
    <p>• S’pore di­ver­si­fies sup­plies, after worry over empty shelves</p>
    <p>A year ago to­day, China alerted the world to a new virus. Covid-19 has since in­fected 82 mil­lion peo­ple world­wide, killing about 1.8 mil­lion. As hope emerges with sev­eral coun­tries in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore start­ing vac­ci­na­tions, The Straits Times looks at the year of dark clouds, and sil­ver lin­ings ahead.</p>
    <p>As the threat of con­tract­ing the coro­n­avirus on public trans­port and in densely packed of­fice spa­ces loomed, em­ploy­ees all over the globe bade their work­places good­bye and hun­kered down at home to work.</p>
    <p>Lights in of­fice tow­ers went out, and busi­ness dis­tricts fell silent. Of­fice desks were swopped for makeshift stud­ies at home, and meet­ings re­placed by tele­con­fer­enc­ing calls.</p>
    <p>Such work-from-home ar­range­ments were man­dated in Sin­ga­pore for most work­ers – ex­cept those in the es­sen­tial ser­vices – when a cir­cuit breaker was im­posed from April to June.</p>
    <p>Though re­stric­tions on re­turn­ing to the of­fice have been grad­u­ally eased since then, many firms have con­tin­ued to adopt flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>But not ev­ery­one coped well with the un­ex­pected tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>In a sur­vey of 1,407 re­spon­dents con­ducted from May to June by the Na­tional Univer­sity Health Sys­tem’s Mind Sci­ence Cen­tre, 61 per cent of peo­ple work­ing from home re­ported feel­ing stressed, com­pared with 53 per cent of work­ers on the front line of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The change af­fected women more, a greater pro­por­tion of whom re­ported feel­ing stressed at home. A pos­si­ble rea­son was that they con­tin­ued to shoul­der the lion’s share of house­hold and par­ent­ing du­ties, even though men car­ried out more do­mes­tic chores and child­care du­ties than be­fore. As a con­se­quence of the un­equal bur­den, women’s men­tal health and work per­for­mance were af­fected, some stud­ies found.</p>
    <p>Liv­ing round the clock with fam­ily also ex­ac­er­bated ten­sions for many.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment (MSF), in a June sub­mis­sion to the United Na­tions’ spe­cial rap­por­teur on vi­o­lence against women, noted that there was an in­crease in re­fer­rals and calls re­lated to do­mes­tic con­flict and vi­o­lence dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>The re­stricted per­sonal space and pri­vacy even forced some young peo­ple who live with their par­ents to be­gin mak­ing plans to move out, noted Mr Asher Low, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of Lim­it­less, a non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion that works with young peo­ple.</p>
    <p>MSF’s Adult Pro­tec­tive Ser­vice and Child Pro­tec­tive Ser­vice also saw a 40 per cent rise in the av­er­age monthly num­ber of in­quiries be­tween Jan­uary and Oc­to­ber, com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>MSF said a num­ber of these calls were re­lated to ten­sions in the fam­ily as well as mar­i­tal con­flicts and dis­putes that did not in­volve in­ci­dents of vi­o­lence, and were thus not in­ves­ti­gated. Cases which re­quired fur­ther sup­port were re­ferred to com­mu­nity agen­cies for help.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age monthly num­ber of new cases in­ves­ti­gated by the pro­tec­tive ser­vices be­tween Jan­uary and Oc­to­ber re­mained sta­ble at 120, sim­i­lar to the monthly av­er­age last year.</p>
    <p>These were the dark clouds of liv­ing and work­ing at home to­gether. But there was also a sil­ver lin­ing to so many peo­ple telecom­mut­ing. There was less load on the public trans­port sys­tem, with time and ex­penses saved as well.</p>
    <p>It also al­lowed for more fam­ily time, said Mr Ishak Is­mail, chair­man of Fam­i­lies for Life, a peo­ple­sec­tor coun­cil un­der MSF. “Fam­i­lies be­came closer be­cause they saw more of one an­other dur­ing the work day,” he noted.</p>
    <p>Some firms in Sin­ga­pore could fol­low in the foot­steps of global ones such as tech com­pany Fu­jitsu and so­cial me­dia gi­ant Face­book, for which telecom­mut­ing could be­come a cost-sav­ing per­ma­nent op­tion for staff.</p>
    <p>Fu­jitsu will halve its of­fice space in Ja­pan by the end of fis­cal year 2022 and en­cour­age 80,000 of­fice work­ers to work re­motely for the most part, while Face­book announced that up to half its work­force are likely to be work­ing from home within five to 10 years.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, eight out of 10 work­ers said in an Oc­to­ber sur­vey com­mis­sioned by The Straits Times that they pre­fer to work from home or have flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of MPs and ac­tivists are also call­ing for flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments to be adopted as stan­dard prac­tice, cit­ing the pos­i­tive ex­pe­ri­ences that have emerged from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ms Shai­ley Hin­go­rani, head of re­search and ad­vo­cacy at the As­so­ci­a­tion of Women for Ac­tion and Re­search, also hopes this can lay the ground­work for the Govern­ment to leg­is­late the right for work­ers to re­quest flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>“(These) can go a long way in help­ing women to bal­ance work and care re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, and thus help to close the gen­der pay gap,” she said.</p>
    <p>At the same time, em­ploy­ees should be pro­tected from com­mon pit­falls even as they reap ben­e­fits from this new world of work, said labour ex­perts.</p>
    <p>A new tri­par­tite ad­vi­sory was re­leased last month re­gard­ing the men­tal well-be­ing of work­ers, who face greater men­tal stress and risk of burnout from jug­gling work and per­sonal com­mit­ments while telecom­mut­ing.</p>
    <p>One rec­om­men­da­tion i n the ad­vi­sory is for em­ploy­ers to state clearly what after-hours work com­mu­ni­ca­tion is al­lowed.</p>
    <p>Ms Hin­go­rani stressed that flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments alone “are not a panacea to the en­trenched prob­lems of un­equal gen­der roles at home”.</p>
    <p>Some work is al­ready be­ing done to ad­dress this. A com­pre­hen­sive re­view of is­sues af­fect­ing women was launched by the Govern­ment in Septem­ber, with the aim of bring­ing about a mind­set change on val­ues like gen­der equal­ity and re­spect for women.</p>
