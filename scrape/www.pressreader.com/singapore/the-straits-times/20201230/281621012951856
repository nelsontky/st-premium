    <p>The Na­tional Arts Coun­cil (NAC) and Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) will be ac­cept­ing pilot ap­pli­ca­tions for out­door live per­for­mances for up to 250 au­di­ence mem­bers in zones of 50 each.</p>
    <p>Un­der phase three of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing, au­di­ences of up to 250 in groups of 50 are also al­lowed in in­door venues, NAC said in a state­ment, in re­sponse to Straits Times queries.</p>
    <p>This is up from an au­di­ence size of up to 100.</p>
    <p>Ms Rachelle Tan, 42, the Es­planade’s di­rec­tor of venues and plan­ning, said the first per­for­mance at the arts cen­tre with 250 au­di­ence mem­bers will be Rock 21 at the Es­planade Con­cert Hall on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The venue has been con­duct­ing pilot tri­als for up to 100 peo­ple at its out­door the­atre.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan added: “We will also in­crease au­di­ence ca­pac­ity from 100 peo­ple (in two zones) to 150 peo­ple (in three zones) at the Es­planade Out­door The­atre from Jan 1, in line with safe man­age­ment mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Orches­tra (SCO) ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Ter­ence Ho, 50, said the new limit will ben­e­fit only larger spa­ces such as the Es­planade and Star theatres.</p>
    <p>These venues, with seat­ing ca­pac­i­ties of more than 1,000, can ac­com­mo­date the bub­ble-wrap seat­ing which ne­ces­si­tates 1m dis­tances within groups of 50, and a 3m dis­tance be­tween groups of 50, as well as sep­a­rate en­trances and ex­its for each group.</p>
    <p>Un­der these guide­lines, the SCO’s Sin­ga­pore Con­fer­ence Hall venue can ac­com­mo­date only up to 125 au­di­ence mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Mr Ho is hop­ing in­stead to ex­pand au­di­ence sizes for SCO’s out­door per­for­mances, start­ing with a gig at the Botanic Gar­dens next month.</p>
    <p>Con­cert pro­mot­ers The Straits Times spoke to have no plans yet to or­gan­ise any out­door shows un­der the pilot.</p>
    <p>IMC Live Global is plan­ning a se­ries of con­certs at Capi­tol The­atre over the next two months for live au­di­ences of up to 250.</p>
    <p>On Dec 18 and 19, AEG and Col­lec­tive Minds or­gan­ised a trial in­door con­cert at the Sands The­atre at Ma­rina Bay Sands which had manda­tory pre-event Covid-19 test­ing and an au­di­ence of 400.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has tri­alled preevent test­ing for meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­fer­ences and ex­hi­bi­tions events and live con­certs.</p>
    <p>Mr Ho said there have been dis­cus­sions about con­duct­ing anti­gen tests for SCO mu­si­cians and crew as a pre­ven­tive mea­sure.</p>
    <p>But the pro­hib­i­tive costs – sev­eral thou­sand dol­lars for each per­for­mance in­volv­ing 50 to 70 staff – as well as the in­fras­truc­tural de­mand, are a de­ter­rent.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth is ex­tend­ing an ex­ist­ing 80 per cent sub­sidy for venue hire and in-house pro­duc­tion cost un­til March 31.</p>
    <p>The sub­sidy is for arts and cul­ture ac­tiv­i­ties at venues such as the Es­planade, Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore and Na­tional Her­itage Board mu­se­ums.</p>
    <p>The sub­sidy is also ex­tended to se­lected arts cen­tres with shared fa­cil­i­ties un­der NAC.</p>
