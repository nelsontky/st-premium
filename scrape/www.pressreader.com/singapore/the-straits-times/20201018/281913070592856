    <p>KENOSHA • Tap­ping on his cell­phone with a sense of pur­pose, Mr Kevin Mathew­son, a former wed­ding pho­tog­ra­pher and one-time city al­der­man in Kenosha, Wis­con­sin, did not slow down to fix his ty­pos as he dashed off an on­line ap­peal to his neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>It was time, he wrote on Face­book in late Au­gust, to “take up arms to de­fend out (sic) City tonight from the evil thugs”.</p>
    <p>One day ear­lier, hun­dreds of res­i­dents had poured onto the streets of Kenosha to protest against the po­lice shoot­ing of 29-year-old Mr Ja­cob Blake. Dis­turbed by the sight of build­ings in flames when he drove down­town, Mr Mathew­son de­cided it was time for peo­ple to arm them­selves to pro­tect their houses and busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>To his sur­prise, some 4,000 peo­ple re­sponded on Face­book.</p>
    <p>Within min­utes, the Kenosha Guard had sprung to life.</p>
    <p>His call to arms – along with sim­i­lar calls from oth­ers in­side and out­side the state – pro­pelled civil­ians bear­ing mil­i­tary-style ri­fles onto the streets, where late that night a teenager scuf­fling with pro­test­ers shot three of them, two fa­tally.</p>
    <p>The Kenosha Guard then evap­o­rated just as quickly as it arose.</p>
    <p>Long a di­vi­sive fig­ure in Kenosha, Mr Mathew­son, 36, who sprin­kles his sen­tences with “Jeez!” and de­scribes him­self as “chunky”, does not fit the typ­i­cal pro­file of a ri­fle-tot­ing watch­dog, al­though he said he sup­ported Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump on Sec­ond Amend­ment grounds.</p>
    <p>The rise and fall of his Kenosha Guard re­flects the spirit of vig­i­lan­tism sur­fac­ing across the United States. Or­gan­i­sa­tions that openly dis­play weapons have ex­isted for decades, with cer­tain hot-but­ton is­sues like im­mi­gra­tion or Sec­ond Amend­ment rights in­spir­ing peo­ple who think the US Con­sti­tu­tion is un­der threat.</p>
    <p>Anti-im­mi­grant and Is­lam­o­pho­bic sen­ti­ments are rife, and some mil­i­tant groups, like the Oath Keep­ers or the Three Per­centers, train to­gether un­der es­tab­lished hi­er­ar­chies.</p>
    <p>Ever since the 2017 white na­tion­al­ist march in Char­lottesvill­e, Vir­ginia, armed groups have be­come fix­tures at demon­stra­tions around the coun­try, al­though mem­ber­ship num­bers re­main opaque.</p>
    <p>With the ap­proach­ing elec­tion ratch­et­ing up ten­sions in re­cent months, armed groups that as­sem­bled via a few clicks on the key­board have be­come both more vis­i­ble and more wide­spread.</p>
    <p>Some es­pe­cially vi­o­lent groups were rooted in long­stand­ing antigov­ern­ment ex­trem­ism, like the 14 men charged with var­i­ous crimes in Michi­gan this month. They in­cluded six ac­cused by the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion of plot­ting to kid­nap Gov­er­nor Gretchen Whit­mer, whom the sus­pects had la­belled a “tyrant”.</p>
    <p>Start­ing in April, demon­stra­tions against coro­n­avirus lock­downs prompted makeshift vig­i­lante groups to move off­line and into the real world. That trickle be­came a tor­rent amid the na­tion­wide protests af­ter the po­lice killing of Mr Ge­orge Floyd in Minneapoli­s – with some armed groups claim­ing to pro­tect the pro­test­ers while oth­ers sought to check them.</p>
    <p>“They just spawn out of nowhere,” said Ms J.J. MacNab, a fel­low at Ge­orge Wash­ing­ton Univer­sity’s Pro­gramme on Ex­trem­ism.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts who study vi­o­lent groups say many are tech­ni­cally not mili­tias; they are too un­struc­tured and do not un­der­take ba­sic steps like train­ing to­gether.</p>
    <p>The Sec­ond Amend­ment may men­tion a “well-reg­u­lated mili­tia”, but all 50 US states ban pri­vate para­mil­i­tary groups, said Ms Mary McCord, a former se­nior Jus­tice Depart­ment of­fi­cial now at Ge­orge­town Univer­sity Law Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Mr Mathew­son first tried to muster the Kenosha Guard in June af­ter the city had small protests be­cause of Mr Floyd’s death in Min­nesota. A lit­tle more than 60 peo­ple re­sponded.</p>
    <p>Then, on Aug 23, video emerged that showed a Kenosha po­lice of­fi­cer fir­ing seven times to­wards Mr Blake’s back. When protests dis­in­te­grated into prop­erty de­struc­tion, Mr Mathew­son said, he thought law en­force­ment was over­whelmed.</p>
    <p>Af­ter two nights of demon­stra­tions, he posted an event on Face­book called “Armed Civil­ians to Pro­tect our Lives and Prop­erty”.</p>
    <p>He named him­self com­man­der of the Kenosha Guard and added an open let­ter to po­lice telling them not to in­ter­fere.</p>
    <p>“That got a lot of trac­tion,” Mr Mathew­son said. “Tons and tons of shares, likes, com­ments.”</p>
    <p>Sev­eral hun­dred peo­ple vol­un­teered to par­tic­i­pate and around 4,000 ex­pressed ap­proval. His call to arms spread to other plat­forms.</p>
    <p>As ten­sions surged, with pro­test­ers and armed en­forcers tus­sling, the au­thor­i­ties said Kyle Rit­ten­house, a 17-year-old from nearby Illi­nois, opened fire with a mil­i­tarystyle semi-au­to­matic ri­fle, killing two pro­test­ers and se­ri­ously wound­ing a third. He faces homi­cide charges and has be­come a poster boy for the far right.</p>
    <p>Mr Mathew­son re­mains un­sure which armed men down­town re­sponded to his call. He said what he did was cov­ered by free speech.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the shoot­ings, Face­book banned Mr Mathew­son for life, re­mov­ing his per­sonal and pro­fes­sional pages.</p>
    <p>Mr Mathew­son said that for now he has no plans to re­vive the Kenosha Guard. His wife has had enough of the spot­light, he said, with his phone ring­ing con­stantly.</p>
    <p>“I am get­ting love and hate from all over the coun­try,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Kevin Mathew­son (above) re­mains un­sure which armed men down­town re­sponded to his call. He says what he did is cov­ered by free speech.</p>
