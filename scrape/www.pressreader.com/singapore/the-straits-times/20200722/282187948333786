    <p>NEW DELHI • The In­dian Premier League (IPL) will start i n the United Arab Emi­rates from Septem­ber if In­dia’s govern­ment al­lows it, its chair­man said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The post­pone­ment of the Twenty20 World Cup un­til next year be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has opened the way for the sus­pended IPL sea­son to get un­der way af­ter mul­ti­ple de­lays.</p>
    <p>The Board of Con­trol for Cricket in In­dia (BCCI) now wants to hold the tour­na­ment, which draws top stars from around the world, from Septem­ber un­til early Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>“It will be held in the UAE, but first, the board will seek per­mis­sion from the In­dian govern­ment to stage it there,” IPL chair­man Bri­jesh Pa­tel said.</p>
    <p>He added that ex­act dates would be de­cided by the IPL’s gov­ern­ing coun­cil in a meeting next week.</p>
    <p>“But we are look­ing at Septem­ber-Oc­to­ber and a bit of Novem­ber for the event to take place.”</p>
    <p>Me­dia re­ports have said the IPL will run from Sept 26 to Nov 7.</p>
    <p>Pa­tel would not say whether the games would be played be­hind closed doors, with the fi­nal de­ci­sion rest­ing with the UAE and In­dian au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The IPL is the BCCI’s main rev­enue earner. It has said it would lose more than US$500 mil­lion (S$695 mil­lion) if this year’s tour­na­ment does not go ahead.</p>
    <p>The seven-week ex­trav­a­ganza, which nor­mally plays to packed sta­di­ums across the country of 1.3 bil­lion people, is es­ti­mated to gen­er­ate more than US$11 bil­lion for the In­dian econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The BCCI had to wait un­til the In­ter­na­tional Cricket Coun­cil post­poned the World Cup on Mon­day be­fore an­nounc­ing its plan.</p>
    <p>The IPL has been held out­side In­dia twice, in the years it clashed with na­tional elec­tions. South Africa hosted it in 2009 and part of it was held in the UAE in 2014.</p>
    <p>The 13th edi­tion of IPL should have started on March 29, but it has been post­poned be­cause of a na­tion­wide lock­down en­acted to stem the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>A host of in­ter­na­tional stars, in­clud­ing Eng­land’s Ben Stokes and Aus­tralians Steve Smith, David Warner and Pat Cum­mins all have IPL con­tracts.</p>
    <p>Cum­mins will be the most ex­pen­sive over­seas player this year af­ter the Kolkata Knight Rid­ers agreed a US$2.17 mil­lion (S$3.02 mil­lion) fee for him.</p>
