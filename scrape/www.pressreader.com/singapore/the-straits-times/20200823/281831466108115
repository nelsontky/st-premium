    <p>For many of his 37 years as a hawker in Chi­na­town Com­plex, Mr Poon Sun Hay would rise at 5am and head to his Pan Ji Cooked Food stall to make Sachima, a crispy snack covered in su­gar syrup.</p>
    <p>The 64-year-old is re­port­edly the last seller of hand­made Sachima here, with no one to in­herit his trade. Ex­cept for the older gen­er­a­tion, few would have heard of it.</p>
    <p>As part of a Hawker Day Out event to be held from this com­ing Satur­day to Sept 6, cu­ri­ous food­ies can visit his stall, one of sev­eral stops in a tour of the com­plex.</p>
    <p>The event con­sists of four guided tours through Sin­ga­pore’s largest hawker cen­tre, giv­ing vis­i­tors the chance to sam­ple tra­di­tional dishes and learn about their her­itage.</p>
    <p>Sachima, for ex­am­ple, was sup­pos­edly eaten by the con­quer­ing Machurian army in the 1600s.</p>
    <p>Each tour fo­cuses on a dif­fer­ent as­pect of hawker cul­ture, with vis­its to some of the 226 food stalls in the com­plex and op­por­tu­ni­ties to in­ter­act with the hawk­ers and try off-menu items such as Chee Cheong Hor Fun.</p>
    <p>The tours are also avail­able vir­tu­ally over Zoom, where par­tic­i­pants can in­ter­act with the hawk­ers and guide, and sam­ple the dishes through a food plat­ter de­liv­ered to their doorstep.</p>
    <p>Con­ducted by lo­cal tour agency Tribe, the tours will also ex­plore the history of hawker cul­ture here.</p>
    <p>Three of the phys­i­cal tours will cost $25 per per­son, while the last, a “Hawker Discovery” tour, will cost $10 per per­son. A max­i­mum of 10 are al­lowed for each ses­sion.</p>
    <p>The vir­tual tours are priced at $25 per per­son, with a max­i­mum of 20 peo­ple al­lowed in each ses­sion.</p>
    <p>Tribe’s head of part­ner­ships and busi­ness de­vel­op­ment Law Yock Song, who cu­rated the tours, said the tour agency is in talks with In­done­sian tick­et­ing plat­forms to see if such live-streamed tours can be ex­panded to an over­seas mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has made us more in­no­va­tive. We be­lieve it’s a bet­ter way to en­gage our au­di­ence,” he said.</p>
    <p>For the phys­i­cal tours at Chi­na­town Com­plex, there will be eight ses­sions each day over the two week­ends dur­ing the event. For the vir­tual tours, there will be three ses­sions each day over two week­ends.</p>
    <p>The tours in­clude vouch­ers for the stalls at Chi­na­town Com­plex.</p>
    <p>There will be pro­mo­tions such as dis­counted food, free drinks, goodie bags and a con­test where pa­trons can vote for their favourite hawker.</p>
    <p>More de­tails are avail­able at http://EatShopPla­y.sg/ hawk­er­day­out</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board is pro­vid­ing fund­ing and mar­ket­ing sup­port for the event, which is part of the Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers cam­paign that aims to boost lo­cal tourism in the wake of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>It was an­nounced last Monday that Sin­ga­pore­ans would get $320 mil­lion in Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers Vouch­ers to spend as part of this cam­paign.</p>
    <p>The event is or­gan­ised by the Chi­na­town Com­plex Hawk­ers’ As­so­ci­a­tion to­gether with EatShopPla­y, a pri­vate or­gan­i­sa­tion pro­mot­ing hawker cul­ture.</p>
    <p>EatShopPla­y’s co-founder Ni­cole Lim said yes­ter­day that she and her co-founder learnt that many hawk­ers have fas­ci­nat­ing sto­ries to tell, but Sin­ga­pore­ans of­ten take hawker cui­sine for granted.</p>
    <p>She said that if Hawker Day Out is suc­cess­ful, EatShopPla­y hopes to or­gan­ise sim­i­lar events in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“We want to do this so the next gen­er­a­tion can still en­joy hawker food,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mr Law said tour guides who have been af­fected by the ab­sence of tourists can also ben­e­fit from such events.</p>
    <p>The Chi­na­town Com­plex Hawk­ers’ As­so­ci­a­tion hopes the event will help re­ju­ve­nate not just the hawker stalls but the en­tire com­plex, which houses around 480 other stalls selling sun­dries and fresh pro­duce.</p>
    <p>The as­so­ci­a­tion’s sec­re­tary, Mr Yao Fang, said that busi­ness has been badly hit as some stores de­pend on tourists for up to 70 per cent of their busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Hawker Tan Ming Han, 34, helps out at his fam­ily’s dried cut­tle­fish and bis­cuit stall, which saw an 80 per cent fall in busi­ness due to the out­break.</p>
    <p>Although busi­ness has im­proved re­cently, he is con­cerned for the other stalls in the com­plex.</p>
    <p>“Chi­na­town Com­plex has sort of been for­got­ten by peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“I hope through this event we can re-en­er­gise it and bring busi­ness back to the rest of the com­plex through a mul­ti­plier ef­fect,” he said.</p>
