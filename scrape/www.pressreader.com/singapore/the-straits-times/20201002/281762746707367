    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said the de­ci­sion to lift the bor­der re­stric­tions was made be­cause Aus­tralia and Viet­nam have suc­cess­fully con­trolled the spread of the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will al­low trav­ellers from Aus­tralia – ex­cept Vic­to­ria state – and Viet­nam to en­ter from next Thurs­day, but many hol­i­day­mak­ers may prove re­luc­tant to visit be­cause they will still have to un­dergo quar­an­tine when they re­turn home.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralians trav­el­ling from Vic­to­ria, or those who have been in the state within the pre­vi­ous 14 days, will re­main barred from en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore. Vic­to­ria’s cap­i­tal, Mel­bourne, is cur­rently in lock­down af­ter be­ing hit by a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions, though its case num­bers are drop­ping quickly.</p>
    <p>Out­side Vic­to­ria, Aus­tralia is largely free of com­mu­nity trans­mit­ted cases of Covid-19. Yes­ter­day, the coun­try recorded 18 new cases of the dis­ease – 15 in Vic­to­ria, two in New South Wales and one in Western Aus­tralia. It has seen a to­tal of 27,096 cases and 888 deaths.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Viet­nam has not logged any lo­cal trans­mis­sion for four weeks af­ter suc­cess­fully con­tain­ing two waves of Covid-19 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>As at yes­ter­day af­ter­noon, Viet­nam has recorded 1,095 cases and 35 deaths.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said the de­ci­sion to lift the bor­der re­stric­tions was made be­cause Aus­tralia and Viet­nam have suc­cess­fully con­trolled the spread of the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>He said he had spo­ken to his Aus­tralian coun­ter­part, Mr Michael Mc­Cor­mack, and to Viet­nam’s Am­bas­sador to Sin­ga­pore, Mrs Tao Thi Than Huong, about the move, and that the two coun­tries will con­sider re­mov­ing re­stric­tions on trav­ellers who ar­rive from Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Last month, Sin­ga­pore opened its bor­ders to vis­i­tors from New Zealand and Brunei in a bid to boost the tourism sec­tor and re­sus­ci­tate Changi Air­port. Vis­i­tors from these coun­tries, and new ar­rivals from Aus­tralia and Viet­nam, will have to un­dergo a Covid-19 test on ar­rival and re­main in their ac­com­mo­da­tion un­til they re­ceive a neg­a­tive re­sult.</p>
    <p>As at yes­ter­day, vis­i­tors from Aus­tralia and Viet­nam could make short-term vis­its sub­ject to con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>But Aus­tralia’s fed­eral govern­ment still has strict travel curbs in place, in­clud­ing the re­quire­ment that any­one want­ing to go over­seas must re­ceive an ex­emp­tion from the Depart­ment of Home Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia also re­quires all trav­ellers ar­riv­ing from abroad to un­dergo 14 days in quar­an­tine. States can charge for quar­an­tine. In New South Wales, the main gate­way, those ar­riv­ing from abroad must pay A$3,000 (S$2,900).</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, Viet­namese who have com­pleted their over­seas trips will have to join a queue along­side other coun­try­men wait­ing to be repa­tri­ated home, where a 14-day state quar­an­tine awaits.</p>
    <p>These re­stric­tions are ex­pected to de­ter hol­i­day­mak­ers from rush­ing to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>One Aus­tralian com­menter said on the Ex­ec­u­tive Trav­eller web­site: “This is bet­ter suited to peo­ple re­lo­cat­ing for work or spend­ing maybe one to two weeks there.”</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son said this week that he hoped to in­tro­duce home-based quar­an­tine to make it eas­ier for peo­ple to travel.</p>
    <p>Mr Le Tien Dung, 45, a Ho Chi Minh City-based man­ager, said he would con­sider tak­ing a va­ca­tion in Sin­ga­pore if he is al­lowed to quar­an­tine him­self at home af­ter his re­turn. Be­fore Covid-19 struck, he used to travel to Sin­ga­pore for busi­ness meet­ings.</p>
    <p>“My fam­ily have not been to Sin­ga­pore at all. That is why we thought about go­ing there this sum­mer,” he said. “But now sum­mer has passed, and we need to see if there are any more long va­ca­tions ahead.”</p>
