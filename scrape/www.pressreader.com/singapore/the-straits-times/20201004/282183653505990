    <p>Marcelo Bielsa’s first taste of the Premier League has brought him a raft of new ad­mir­ers. Sur­pris­ingly, it does not ap­pear to be a mu­tual ad­mi­ra­tion so­ci­ety. The Ar­gen­tinian thought he saw de­fen­sive foot­ball all around him.</p>
    <p>“The English game is at a cross­roads, whether we ac­cept win­ning with­out car­ing how we win, or to go for it,” he said last week. “I al­ways had the idea the English pub­lic pre­fer their teams to go for it but I don’t see this as clearly as I used to.”</p>
    <p>It was a strange as­sess­ment. When he spoke, both of Leeds’ games had fin­ished 4-3. Three days later, the di­vi­sion had its third 5-2 of the em­bry­onic sea­son. There were more 3-3 draws than 0-0s.</p>
    <p>After three rounds of fix­tures, the Premier League was aver­ag­ing 3.68 goals per game, way up on last sea­son’s 2.72 and the pre­vi­ous decade’s 2.75. Three weeks can be a small sam­ple size, but the league’s first three rounds last sea­son pro­duced 2.73 goals per game.</p>
    <p>So why the sud­den goal glut? Per­haps the most ob­vi­ous an­swer is the rash of penalties – 20 in the first 28 games puts the di­vi­sion on course for 271 this sea­son, though, after six al­ready, there should be fewer ridicu­lous spot kicks for hand­ball now.</p>
    <p>But there are many foot­balling rea­sons and a top­i­cal is­sue in strange times: Lack­ing a home crowd to in­tim­i­date, per­haps vis­it­ing teams are em­pow­ered to at­tack more.</p>
    <p>Be­fore yes­ter­day’s games, there were 17 away wins to just nine at home; 61 of the 103 goals came from away teams. Spec­tac­u­lar score­lines may be fa­cil­i­tated by pro­gres­sive man­agers at mid-ta­ble clubs: Bielsa, Graham Pot­ter and Ralph Hasen­huttl have at­tack­ing philoso­phies.</p>
    <p>Com­pared to pre­vi­ous years, there are fewer prag­matic man­agers. There is no Sam</p>
    <p>Al­lardyce, Tony Pulis, Chris Hughton or Claude Puel.</p>
    <p>Pot­ter’s Brighton had 44 shots in their first three games, while there were 50 ef­forts on Leeds’ goal. Hasen­huttl’s high de­fen­sive line is a risky tac­tic that back­fired in Southamp­ton’s 5-2 thrash­ing by Spurs.</p>
    <p>West Bromwich Al­bion and Fulham, pro­moted clubs who came up look­ing naive, con­ceded at least three goals in each of their first three out­ings. De­fen­sive mishaps have many ori­gins. It was out of char­ac­ter for Wolves to be as poor at the back as they were in their 4-0 thrash­ing at West Ham.</p>
    <p>But the lack of a pre-sea­son, and an in­ter­na­tional break be­fore the first fix­tures, made it harder to drill de­fences. Some semi-fit teams have been picked off on the counter-at­tack. Liver­pool and Manch­ester United both strug­gled de­fen­sively in their first game.</p>
    <p>Two of the other sup­posed su­per­pow­ers, Manch­ester City and Chelsea, also have fun­da­men­tal is­sues at the back – even if new sign­ings may yet ad­dress them – which is why the elite have been con­ced­ing more.</p>
    <p>Chelsea, with Kepa Ar­riz­a­bal­aga’s strug­gles, are one of sev­eral clubs whose goal­keep­ers have been found want­ing.</p>
    <p>But maybe that is part of a more ba­sic truth. Per­haps the Premier League just has more high-class at­tack­ers than de­fend­ers and more ex­cel­lent at­tack­ing sides than solid de­fen­sive units. It could carry on rain­ing goals.</p>
    <p>Lack­ing a home crowd to in­tim­i­date, per­haps vis­it­ing teams are em­pow­ered to at­tack more. Be­fore yes­ter­day’s games, there were 17 away wins to just nine at home; 61 of the 103 goals came from away teams.</p>
