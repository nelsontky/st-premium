    <p>The prices of re­sale con­do­mini­ums held firm amid ro­bust de­mand last month, with more than 1,000 units sold for the third straight month.</p>
    <p>An es­ti­mated 1,286 re­sale con­do­minium units changed hands last month – up 0.4 per cent from Au­gust and 62.8 per cent higher than in Septem­ber last year, ac­cord­ing to flash fig­ures from real es­tate por­tal SRX Prop­erty yesterday.</p>
    <p>Mr Nicholas Mak, ERA Realty’s head of re­search and con­sul­tancy, said the Hun­gry Ghost Fes­ti­val from Aug 19 to Sept 16, which some be­lieve is an in­aus­pi­cious pe­riod to make ma­jor de­ci­sions, had not stopped home buy­ers from pur­chas­ing real es­tate.</p>
    <p>“One rea­son is that some home buy­ers be­lieve the worst im­pact of the pan­demic in Sin­ga­pore is over and it is time to re-en­ter the mar­ket... the fear of los­ing out is greater than the fear of hun­gry ghosts.”</p>
    <p>Ms Chris­tine Sun, head of re­search and con­sul­tancy at OrangeTee & Tie, said more buy­ers are throng­ing the re­sale mar­ket in search of “value buys”, es­pe­cially at­trac­tively priced, large-sized re­sale units.</p>
    <p>She said URA Realis data showed that 33.9 per cent of condo re­sale trans­ac­tions last month were for units be­tween 800 sq ft and 1,200 sq ft, while 47.7 per cent of trans­ac­tions were for larger units of 1,200 sq ft and above.</p>
    <p>Last month’s re­sale trans­ac­tions in­cluded two bulk pur­chases of apart­ments in the Balestier Road area – 12 units at Vic­tory Point and 10 units at Cres­cent Build­ing – by com­pa­nies, ac­cord­ing to URA Realis data.</p>
    <p>De­spite the rise in de­mand, re­sale condo prices last month re­mained sta­ble, inch­ing up by 0.1 per cent from Au­gust, and by the same amount over Septem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>The core cen­tral re­gion (CCR) and the rest of cen­tral re­gion (RCR) saw a mar­ginal re­sale price in­crease of 0.5 per cent and 0.8 per cent re­spec­tively, while the out­side cen­tral re­gion (OCR) saw a 0.5 per cent de­crease.</p>
    <p>A condo unit at Le Nou­vel Ard­more in Tan­glin in the CCR that went for $16.2 mil­lion was last month’s most ex­pen­sive re­sale pur­chase.</p>
    <p>In the city fringes or RCR, the high­est price was for a $5.1 mil­lion unit at Camelot By-The-Wa­ter in Tan­jong Rhu Road, while the high­est sale in the OCR came from a $4.8 mil­lion unit at The Tril­inq in Cle­menti.</p>
    <p>Look­ing ahead, Mr Mak said the new re­stric­tions on de­vel­op­ers reis­su­ing op­tions to pur­chase (OTPs) an­nounced on Sept 28 may cause some buy­ers to ex­plore the re­sale prop­erty mar­ket in­stead of new projects.</p>
    <p>Un­der the terms of a stan­dard OTP, buy­ers of new pri­vate homes have three weeks to book their right to buy a prop­erty from a de­vel­oper af­ter mak­ing a cash down pay­ment, which is up to 5 per cent of the price of the unit. If the buyer does not ex­er­cise the right to buy, he may for­feit 25 per cent of the book­ing fee.</p>
    <p>But some de­vel­op­ers had been reis­su­ing OTPs to buy­ers, giv­ing them more time to line up the funds needed to make the pur­chase and avoid pay­ing the ad­di­tional buyer’s stamp duty.</p>
    <p>Home buy­ers who need com­pleted prop­er­ties af­ter sell­ing their ex­ist­ing homes would also look to the re­sale mar­ket be­cause the ma­jor­ity of prop­er­ties in the pri­mary mar­ket are still un­der devel­op­ment, said Mr Mak.</p>
    <p>He added that pos­si­ble con­struc­tion de­lays due to lock­downs in worker dor­mi­to­ries could also make re­sale prop­er­ties more at­trac­tive, given the cer­tainty of get­ting the keys to the prop­erty af­ter the deal is sealed.</p>
