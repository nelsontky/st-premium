    <p>Dis­cus­sions with the United States on pos­si­ble train­ing lo­ca­tions for the Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Air Force’s (RSAF) next-gen­er­a­tion F-35B Joint Strike Fight­ers are on­go­ing, the Min­istry of De­fence (Min­def) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The min­istry was re­spond­ing to me­dia queries on US re­ports ear­lier this week that the RSAF was eye­ing a new lo­ca­tion in the US to host both its F-35B and F-16 fight­ers.</p>
    <p>Five lo­ca­tions in five US states were re­ported to be in the run­ning.</p>
    <p>Min­def re­it­er­ated that the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces ex­pects to take de­liv­ery of four F-35B fighter air­craft in 2026.</p>
    <p>All four will be de­ployed in the con­ti­nen­tal US for train­ing and in­depth eval­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“Dis­cus­sions on pos­si­ble train­ing lo­ca­tions are on­go­ing with the US Depart­ment of De­fence,” said Min­def, not­ing that over­seas train­ing al­lows the SAF to over­come lo­cal airspace con­straints and to con­duct high-end re­al­is­tic train­ing.</p>
    <p>“The Min­istry of De­fence and the SAF will care­fully eval­u­ate the op­tions to en­sure that the even­tual lo­ca­tion can meet our needs,” it added.</p>
    <p>The re­ports in the US ear­lier this week said that US Sec­re­tary of the Air Force Bar­bara Bar­rett had signed a mem­o­ran­dum on July 6 for a per­ma­nent for­eign mil­i­tary sales train­ing cen­tre in the con­ti­nen­tal US that could host both Sin­ga­pore’s F-16s and its fu­ture F-35s.</p>
    <p>A US Air Force spokesman was quoted as say­ing in the De­fence News web­site on Wed­nes­day that the cen­tre could ac­com­mo­date up to 36 F-35 air­craft.</p>
    <p>The five lo­ca­tions be­ing con­sid­ered are: Fort Smith Air­port (in Arkansas), Hul­man Field (In­di­ana), Buck­ley Air Force Base (Colorado), Joint Base San An­to­nio-Lack­land (Texas), and Sel­fridge Air Na­tional Guard Base (Michi­gan).</p>
    <p>The spokesman added that the co-lo­ca­tion of Sin­ga­pore’s F-16s with its fu­ture F-35s at this new lo­ca­tion was to make room for more US Air Force or its part­ner air forces’ F-35s at Luke Air Force Base in Ari­zona.</p>
    <p>The Ari­zona base cur­rently hosts the RSAF’s Peace Carvin II de­tach­ment, which op­er­ates the F-16s.</p>
    <p>The RSAF has two other de­tach­ments in the US, one op­er­at­ing the F-15SG fight­ers and the other, Apache he­li­copters.</p>
    <p>An­other fighter train­ing de­tach­ment at An­der­sen Air Force Base in Guam is ex­pected to be es­tab­lished by 2029.</p>
    <p>The new F-35s will re­place the RSAF’s F-16s, which will be pro­gres­sively re­tired post-2030.</p>
    <p>Min­def had said pre­vi­ously that it will eval­u­ate the F-35s fully be­fore de­cid­ing to com­mit to a fur­ther eight air­craft.</p>
    <p>There was spec­u­la­tion pre­vi­ously that Sin­ga­pore’s F-35Bs will be lo­cated at one of the US Ma­rine Corps bases, as the Marines are also op­er­at­ing the F-35B vari­ant, which has short take-off and ver­ti­cal land­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties un­like the F-35A.</p>
