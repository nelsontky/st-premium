    <p>Last month, an in­ter­con­ti­nen­tal bal­lis­tic mis­sile (ICBM) was fired in the gen­eral di­rec­tion of the Hawai­ian is­lands. Dur­ing its de­scent a few min­utes later, still out­side the earth’s at­mos­phere, it was struck by an­other mis­sile that de­stroyed it. With that det­o­na­tion, the world’s ten­u­ous nu­clear bal­ance sud­denly threat­ened to come out of kil­ter.</p>
    <p>The dan­ger of atom bombs be­ing used again was al­ready in­creas­ing. Now it’s grown once more. The ICBM fly­ing over the Pa­cific was an Amer­i­can dummy de­signed to test a new kind of in­ter­cep­tor tech­nol­ogy. As it flew, satel­lites spot­ted it and alerted an Air Force base in Colorado, which in turn com­mu­ni­cated with a navy de­stroyer po­si­tioned north-east of Hawaii. This ship, the USS John Finn, fired its own mis­sile which, in the jar­gon, hit and killed the in­com­ing one.</p>
    <p>At first glimpse, this sort of tech­no­log­i­cal wiz­ardry would seem to be a cause for not only awe but also joy, for it prom­ises to pro­tect the United States from mis­sile at­tacks by North Korea, for ex­am­ple. But in the weird logic of nu­clear strat­egy, a break­through in­tended to make us safer could end up mak­ing us less safe.</p>
    <p>That’s be­cause the new in­ter­cep­tion tech­nol­ogy cuts the link be­tween of­fence and de­fence that un­der­lies all cal­cu­la­tions about nu­clear sce­nar­ios.</p>
    <p>Since the Cold War, sta­bil­ity – and thus peace – has been pre­served through the macabre re­al­ity of mu­tual as­sured de­struc­tion, or MAD. No na­tion will launch a first strike if it ex­pects im­me­di­ate re­tal­i­a­tion in kind.</p>
    <p>A dif­fer­ent way of de­scrib­ing MAD is mu­tual vul­ner­a­bil­ity. If one player in this game-the­ory sce­nario sud­denly gets a shield (th­ese Amer­i­can sys­tems are in fact called Aegis), this mu­tual vul­ner­a­bil­ity is gone.</p>
    <p>Ad­ver­saries, in this case mainly Rus­sia but in­creas­ingly China too, must as­sume that their own de­ter­rent is no longer ef­fec­tive be­cause they may not be able to suc­cess­fully strike back. For this rea­son, de­fen­sive es­ca­la­tion has be­come al­most as con­tro­ver­sial as the of­fen­sive kind.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia has been rail­ing against land-based Amer­i­can in­ter­cep­tor sys­tems in places like east­ern Europe and Alaska. But last month’s test was the first in which a ship did the in­ter­cept­ing. This twist means that be­fore long, the US or an­other na­tion could pro­tect it­self from all sides.</p>
    <p>This new un­cer­tainty com­pli­cates a sit­u­a­tion that was al­ready be­com­ing fiendishly in­tri­cate. The US and Rus­sia, which have about 90 per cent of the world’s nukes, have ditched two arms-con­trol treaties in as many decades. The only one re­main­ing, called New Start, is due to ex­pire on Feb 5, a mere 16 days af­ter Mr Joe Bi­den takes of­fice as pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>The Treaty on the Non-Pro­lif­er­a­tion of Nu­clear Weapons, which has for 50 years tried to keep na­tions with­out nukes from ac­quir­ing them, is also in deep trou­ble, and due to be rene­go­ti­ated next year. Iran’s in­ten­tions re­main un­known. At the same time, both the US and Rus­sia are mod­ernising their ar­se­nals, while China is adding to its own as fast as it can.</p>
    <p>Among the new weapons are nukes car­ried by hy­per­sonic mis­siles, which are so fast that the lead­ers of the tar­get na­tion have only min­utes to de­cide what’s in­com­ing and how to re­spond. They in­clude so-called tac­ti­cal nukes, with “smaller” (in a very rel­a­tive sense) pay­loads that make them more suit­able for con­ven­tional wars, thus low­er­ing the thresh­old for their use. The risk thus keeps ris­ing that a nu­clear war starts by ac­ci­dent, mis­cal­cu­la­tion or false alarm, es­pe­cially when fac­tor­ing in sce­nar­ios that in­volve ter­ror­ism, rogue states or con­flicts in outer or cy­berspace.</p>
    <p>In a sort of global protest against this in­san­ity, 84 coun­tries with­out nukes have signed a Treaty on the Pro­hi­bi­tion of Nu­clear Weapons, which will take ef­fect next year. But nei­ther the nine nu­clear na­tions nor their clos­est al­lies will ever sign it. In­stead, the ex­ist­ing nu­clear pow­ers will in­ter­pret news of suc­cess­ful in­ter­cep­tor tests as an im­pe­tus for a new arms race.</p>
    <p>They will make even faster mis­siles with more de­coys and coun­ter­mea­sures, new war­heads for more flex­i­ble uses in a greater va­ri­ety of strate­gic sce­nar­ios, and of course their own shields.</p>
    <p>This must stop. And the best-placed world leader to take the ini­tia­tive in halt­ing the mad­ness is the in­com­ing US pres­i­dent. Upon tak­ing of­fice, Mr Bi­den should im­me­di­ately pro­pose that the US and Rus­sia roll over New Start for an­other five years to buy time. He should si­mul­ta­ne­ously in­vite China and the other nu­clear pow­ers to the ta­ble.</p>
    <p>The first goal should be a dec­la­ra­tion by all nine that their nukes have the sole pur­pose of de­ter­rence and will never be used ag­gres­sively. They should also give new as­sur­ances of se­cu­rity and help to non-nu­clear na­tions, and cre­ate new com­mu­ni­ca­tions pro­to­cols for crises. And yes, they must now agree to limit and mon­i­tor not only each other’s of­fen­sive weapons but also their de­fences.</p>
    <p>The era of MAD and mu­tual vul­ner­a­bil­ity was ter­ri­fy­ing but in a sur­real way also sta­ble. The com­ing era of ques­tion­able de­ter­rence and asym­met­ric vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties will be less sta­ble and, there­fore, even more fright­en­ing. Mr Bi­den will have much in his in­box come Jan­uary. He bet­ter make sure arms con­trol isn’t at the bot­tom.</p>
