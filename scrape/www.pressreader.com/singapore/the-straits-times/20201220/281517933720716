    <p>More than 26,000 tonnes of un­con­sumed food worth $342 mil­lion is thrown away by house­holds ev­ery year be­cause it was not stored or han­dled prop­erly, or was bought with­out think­ing. But things may be chang­ing, ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey last year by the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency, which found that con­sumers are more en­vi­ron­men­tally con­scious now when they shop, cook and cater. The Sun­day Times, in part­ner­ship with DBS Bank, gets to the bot­tom of things, as Ju­dith</p>
    <p>Tan and Vanessa Liu raid two homes to see if the find­ings are true.</p>
    <p>The aver­age Sin­ga­pore house­hold throws away 5kg of food waste ev­ery year. This might not seem much, but taken to­gether, it means 26,000 tonnes and $342 mil­lion end­ing up in the land­fill.</p>
    <p>Half of it need not have been thrown away, which is why 47-year-old One FM 91.3 DJ An­gelique Teo takes pains to make sure that does not hap­pen in her home.</p>
    <p>Ms Teo, who lives with her hus­band in an apart­ment in Yio Chu Kang, says her strat­egy is to plan ahead and make con­scious choices. Both she and her hus­band are ve­gan, and eat no meat, eggs or dairy prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>“I do a weekly gro­cery run on­line and I buy ex­actly what we need for our daily sal­ads. For ex­am­ple, I may get four boxes of co­rian­der, four boxes of kale, some cherry toma­toes and lemons – just the right amount,” she says.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to buy­ing just enough for their meals, Ms Teo, who helms the evening drive-time show, also stores dried foods such as nuts and mush­rooms, and freezes herbs in re­cy­cled glass jars.</p>
    <p>“I get my dried goods in bulk from the zero-waste shop j ust down the road.”</p>
    <p>The goods have no pack­ag­ing, so the glass jars come in handy.</p>
    <p>“They are also handy when I’m freez­ing things like chilli padi, which I have to have, and herbs, which wilt quickly,” adds Ms Teo.</p>
    <p>“I wash them, chop them, bot­tle them and put them straight into the freezer to have at any time.”</p>
    <p>It may be eas­ier to re­duce food waste when there are only two in the house­hold.</p>
    <p>But at the seven-mem­ber Ho house­hold in Ko­van, min­imis­ing food waste has also be­come a habit.</p>
    <p>The mis­tress of the home, vi­cepres­i­dent of pay­ments and plat­forms at DBS Bank Jen­nifer Yong, 50, says she goes to the wet mar­ket in Chi­na­town ev­ery Sun­day to stock up on gro­ceries, “mainly meats, bones for soup and veg­eta­bles”.</p>
    <p>“I have three gen­er­a­tions un­der one roof – my par­ents, my boys, my hus­band and my­self and our Burmese helper. Cater­ing to each and ev­ery­one’s tastes can be a rather daunt­ing task,” she says.</p>
    <p>“But we are very con­scious not to over­buy or over­stock items each time. Al­though we have t wo fridges in the home, we would rather buy less than more.”</p>
    <p>Then, as and when it is needed, more can be bought, she says.</p>
    <p>“With two teenage sons who are of­ten rav­en­ous, I do have to check with my helper by Wed­nes­day if there is still enough food in the fridge.</p>
    <p>“If not, I’ll have her go to the wet mar­ket here in Ko­van to re­plen­ish our sup­plies.”</p>
    <p>The Hos also pre­fer to have a greater va­ri­ety of smaller plates of food at din­ner, which also helps to gen­er­ate less waste.</p>
    <p>“We cook smaller por­tions for the com­mon dishes at meal­times, in­stead of l arge por­tions. This works be­cause we can have more va­ri­ety at the ta­ble.</p>
    <p>“Should there not be enough of, say, veg­eta­bles, then we will cook an ad­di­tional dish dur­ing the meal. Be­sides re­duc­ing our food waste with no left­overs, ev­ery­one gets to en­joy his or her favourite dishes.”</p>
    <p>Those man­ag­ing Sin­ga­pore’s land­fill would wel­come it if more house­holds prac­tised sen­si­ble habits when eat­ing at home.</p>
    <p>A study by the Sin­ga­pore En­vi­ron­ment Coun­cil last year found that the 26,000 tonnes of food wasted by house­holds ev­ery year comes from im­proper stor­age and han­dling. Of­ten, con­sumers are un­aware of how much waste can be ac­cu­mu­lated through their con­sump­tion habits.</p>
    <p>In a Sun­day Times poll of 1,000 res­i­dents con­ducted by on­line mar­ket re­search firm Milieu In­sight in Oc­to­ber, fewer than one in six got it right that food waste from house­holds added up to a to­tal of $342 mil­lion ev­ery year.</p>
    <p>The vast ma­jor­ity un­der­es­ti­mated the amount, and nearly all re­spon­dents said their house­holds threw away only small or “rea­son­able” amounts of food.</p>
    <p>Asked 14 mul­ti­ple-choice ques­tions, such as the dif­fer­ence be­tween “sell by”, “use by” and “best be­fore” dates, and how soon the Se­makau Land­fill would reach ca­pac­ity, close to half got fewer than seven right.</p>
    <p>Food waste is a prob­lem not just be­cause it adds to Sin­ga­pore’s only land­fill – which is ex­pected to be full by 2035 – but also be­cause of the sig­nif­i­cant amount of re­sources and en­ergy wasted that goes into grow­ing, pro­cess­ing and trans­port­ing food.</p>
    <p>Ms Teo and Ms Yong de­cided in­stead to re­cy­cle their food waste by com­post­ing it.</p>
    <p>Ms Teo notes that in the land­fill, food scraps do not break down eas­ily due to a lack of oxy­gen.</p>
    <p>Bro­ken down by mi­cro-or­gan­isms in the ab­sence of oxy­gen, they emit meth­ane, a green­house gas that is ab­sorbed into the at­mos­phere, con­tribut­ing to tem­per­a­tures ris­ing.</p>
    <p>A 2018 Ox­ford Univer­sity study, pub­lished in the jour­nal Sci­ence, found food wastage to be re­spon­si­ble for about 6 per cent of global green­house gas emis­sions.</p>
    <p>About half the emis­sions come from the anaer­o­bic fer­men­ta­tion of solid waste dis­posal on land.</p>
    <p>In her apart­ment, Ms Teo uses a compact com­poster ac­quired from The Green Col­lec­tive SG, a group of sus­tain­able brand own­ers, con­scious con­sumers and busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>The Ur­ban Com­poster was de­signed by Aus­tralian Luke Gregory, and is based on the Ja­panese fer­men­ta­tion method called bokashi, which uses soil con­tain­ing mi­cro-or­gan­isms to cover food waste.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to co-founder of The Green Col­lec­tive SG Danielle Cham­pagne, the Ur­ban Com­poster is fast and anaer­o­bic, pro­duc­ing no green­house gases.</p>
    <p>Ms Teo says: “Af­ter putting the scraps in the com­poster, I use an ac­cel­er­a­tor made from fer­mented fruit ex­tract to has­ten the process.</p>
    <p>“I spray three to five squirts each time I pile on more scraps and about a week and a half later, I get com­post juice.”</p>
    <p>She di­lutes the sour-smelling leachate, called bokashi tea, and sprays it on her pot­ted plants as a fer­tiliser.</p>
    <p>Ms Teo adds, laugh­ing: “Bokashi tea also has a su­per­power. It is com­pletely nat­u­ral, and when it is con­cen­trated, it helps un­clog the drains. I have very good flow­ing sinks in my house all the time be­cause of bokashi tea that comes from the com­post­ing.”</p>
    <p>Ms Yong uses a dif­fer­ent method to com­post left­over food.</p>
    <p>“Noth­ing goes to waste. I cre­ated a bin from an old waste bin in the kitchen and re­pur­posed it for com­post­ing. I put in the food waste and</p>
    <p>let it break down on its own.</p>
    <p>“To mask the smell, I throw pan­dan leaves in.”</p>
    <p>Ms Yong says she uses the com­post on her pa­tio plants and no longer has to buy soil or fer­tiliser.</p>
    <p>Last year, she also grew her own herbs and veg­eta­bles, such as Thai basil, red spinach, bok choy and dou miao.</p>
    <p>She emp­ties the com­post bin once ev­ery six months, and throws some of it around the plants in front of her con­do­minium block.</p>
    <p>“The com­post goes both to my plants and the grounds at the condo, which is why the plants there are thriv­ing,” she says.</p>
    <p>While com­post­ing has yet to be­come com­mon in Sin­ga­pore, a sur­vey com­mis­sioned last year by the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) to track the sen­ti­ments of Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents about food waste found that the public has be­come more en­vi­ron­men­tally con­scious in shop­ping, cook­ing, eat­ing and cater­ing.</p>
    <p>While tak­ing small steps as a con­sumer can be sig­nif­i­cant in achiev­ing the larger goal of shrink­ing food waste to a min­i­mum, Ms Yong would like to see school­child­ren taught prac­ti­cal ways of how to do this at home.</p>
    <p>She says: “The rea­son why cut­ting food waste in Ja­pan is suc­cess­ful is that it is taught to chil­dren as early as in kinder­garten.</p>
    <p>“Per­haps NEA would like to work with the Education Min­istry to have lessons on food waste in­cluded in the social stud­ies cur­ricu­lum. This way, we can en­sure that Sin­ga­pore reaches its zero-waste goal.”</p>

    <p>MAK­ING CON­SCIOUS CHOICES</p>
    <p>I do a weekly gro­cery run on­line and I buy ex­actly what we need for our daily sal­ads. For ex­am­ple, I may get four boxes of co­rian­der, four boxes of kale, some cherry toma­toes and lemons – just the right amount.</p>

    <p>on her strat­egy to min­imise food waste in her house­hold.</p>
    <p>SMALLER POR­TIONS</p>
    <p>We cook smaller por­tions for the com­mon dishes at meal­times, in­stead of large por­tions. This works be­cause we can have more va­ri­ety at the ta­ble. Should there not be enough of, say, veg­eta­bles, then we will cook an ad­di­tional dish dur­ing the meal. Be­sides re­duc­ing our food waste with no left­overs, ev­ery­one gets to en­joy his or her favourite dishes.</p>
