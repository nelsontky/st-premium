    <p>A nurs­ing home has lost its li­cence af­ter fail­ing to com­ply with re­quire­ments, i nclud­ing the tak­ing of Covid-19 pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Thian Leng Old Folks Home, lo­cated off Changi Road, was pe­nalised last Fri­day for re­peat­edly flout­ing its li­cens­ing re­quire­ments and, more re­cently, for fail­ing to ad­here to Covid-19 safe­guards for its res­i­dents and staff, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said in re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times at the week­end.</p>
    <p>It said: “MOH has noted a ris­ing num­ber of non-com­pli­ances since May 2019, re­sult­ing in closer mon­i­tor­ing of the home. How­ever, many of th­ese non-com­pli­ances con­tinue to re­main un­re­solved dur­ing sub­se­quent in­spec­tions.</p>
    <p>“In 2020, MOH also noted ar­eas of non-com­pli­ance re­lated to Covid-19 pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures that were re­quired to be im­ple­mented to safe­guard staff and res­i­dents from the Covid-19 in­fec­tion.”</p>
    <p>The re­vok­ing of t he li­cence comes even af­ter the min­istry had sup­ported and as­sisted the home by sec­ond­ing pro­fes­sional staff to the 70-bed fa­cil­ity on at least four oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>The sup­port ac­tions were meant to help strengthen the clin­i­cal over­sight, care pro­cesses and op­er­a­tions, and to pro­vide guid­ance on mea­sures to be im­ple­mented to ad­dress the home’s lapses, said MOH.</p>
    <p>It added: “De­spite the as­sis­tance pro­vided, we con­tin­ued to de­tect lapses in care stan­dards which placed the well-be­ing and safety of their res­i­dents at risk. A sig­nif­i­cant por­tion of the im­prove­ments in­tro­duced by the home were also not sus­tained.</p>
    <p>“As such, the home’s li­cence has been re­voked on July 31, 2020, to en­sure the safety and well-be­ing of res­i­dents are not put at risk.”</p>
    <p>Al­ter­na­tive care ar­range­ments have been made for all the res­i­dents in the home, in­clud­ing plac­ing them in other nurs­ing homes, and MOH and the Agency for In­te­grated Care have helped to fa­cil­i­tate the re-em­ploy­ment of staff to other nurs­ing homes.</p>
    <p>Mr Liu Kim Beng, 60, chair­man of the home’s man­age­ment com­mit­tee, told ST yes­ter­day that there were 60 res­i­dents and more than 10 for­eign em­ploy­ees who had been moved to other care fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said the op­er­a­tor can ap­ply for a new li­cence to man­age and run a nurs­ing home again if it is able to meet the re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>The nurs­ing home’s man­ager, Ms Su­san Lee, 55, said the home was told on June 2, a day af­ter the end of the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, that its li­cence would be re­voked.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee, who has worked at the home since 2001, said: “We thought we had rec­ti­fied the is­sues and also told the au­thor­i­ties that we would be deal­ing with some of the lapses once the cir­cuit breaker ended.”</p>
    <p>Mr Liu said the Covid-19-re­lated lapses were dis­cov­ered dur­ing an au­dit amid the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod. They in­cluded is­sues with the for­mat of the forms that visi­tors to the home were re­quired to fill in and also safe dis­tanc­ing pro­to­cols for its res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>“They were tech­ni­cally not so se­ri­ous... We did not have any Covid-19 cases among our res­i­dents and staff,” he said.</p>
    <p>When asked to give de­tails on the non-com­pli­ance is­sues that MOH high­lighted last year, Mr Liu said one of them in­volved the in­stal­la­tion of a fire door.</p>
    <p>On the lapses in clin­i­cal and care pro­cesses that the min­istry had raised, he said: “We don’t want to com­ment too much as MOH has al­ready come out with their ex­pla­na­tion – we re­spect that and don’t feel that it is un­fair. This is the sys­tem, and we will have to fol­low.”</p>
    <p>Mr Liu said the home in­tends to reap­ply for a li­cence.</p>
    <p>“Some fam­ily mem­bers of res­i­dents have been call­ing to ask when we will get our li­cence back again. So dur­ing this pe­riod, we will re­think and re­work our pro­cesses, and make them bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>Nurs­ing homes emerged as an area of con­cern af­ter the Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home was iden­ti­fied as a clus­ter in April when 16 res­i­dents and staff caught the virus.</p>
    <p>Strict pro­to­cols to min­imise the risk of in­fec­tion were put in place then that in­cluded bar­ring all visi­tors from the homes.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures have since been re­laxed af­ter Sin­ga­pore en­tered the se­cond phase of re­open­ing, and each res­i­dent is al­lowed to have one vis­i­tor a day for up to 30 minutes.</p>
