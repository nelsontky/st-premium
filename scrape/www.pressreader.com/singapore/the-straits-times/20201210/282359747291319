    <p>NEW YORK • DoorDash raised US$3.37 bil­lion (S$4.5 bil­lion) in an ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO) above its mar­keted range, ac­cord­ing to sources fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The San Fran­cisco-based food de­liv­ery start-up sold 33 mil­lion shares on Tues­day for US$102 each af­ter mar­ket­ing them for US$90 to US$95, said the sources, who asked not to be iden­ti­fied as the in­for­ma­tion is not pub­lic yet.</p>
    <p>At that price, DoorDash has a fully di­luted value of about US$38 bil­lion, which in­cludes em­ployee stock op­tions and re­stricted stock units.</p>
    <p>DoorDash’s IPO is one of the largest United States tech list­ings this year.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is part of a cadre of con­sumer-fac­ing, Web-based busi­nesses that are ex­pected to go pub­lic this month – i nclud­ing home-rental plat­form Airbnb, which was set to price its IPO yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers in­clude video-game com­pany Roblox, in­stal­ment loans provider Af­firm Hold­ings and Con­tex­tLogic, the par­ent of on­line dis­count re­tailer Wish.</p>
    <p>DoorDash has seized on the pan­demic-fu­elled boom in de­mand for meals brought to cus­tomers’ doorsteps, as well as in­vestor ex­u­ber­ance over new stock list­ings, as it moves ahead with its IPO.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue in the first nine months of the year more than tripled and its net loss nar­rowed from a year ear­lier on a surge in new cus­tomers, the firm said in the fil­ing.</p>
    <p>With DoorDash, com­pa­nies have now raised more than US$160 bil­lion in IPOs on US ex­changes this year, an all-time high, ac­cord­ing to data com­piled by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral more are ex­pected be­fore the year end as com­pa­nies that put off list­ing plans dur­ing the early days of the Covid-19 pan­demic re­gain the con­fi­dence to put their shares on pub­lic mar­kets.</p>
    <p>DoorDash’s of­fer­ing is be­ing led by Gold­man Sachs Group and JPMor­gan Chase & Co, with Bar­clays, Deutsche Bank, RBC Cap­i­tal Mar­kets and UBS Group also on the deal. Its shares were ex­pected to be­gin trad­ing yes­ter­day on the New York Stock Ex­change un­der the sym­bol DASH.</p>
