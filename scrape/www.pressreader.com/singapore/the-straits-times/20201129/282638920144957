    <p>Maybe you own a con­do­minium or a Hous­ing Board flat, and you want to leave that prop­erty to the next gen­er­a­tion. In all like­li­hood, you will need a will, a fam­ily trust or life es­tate.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Ms Jacintha Pil­lay, a part­ner at Sim Mong Teck & Part­ners, there are sev­eral in­tri­ca­cies of in­her­i­tance laws here that prop­erty own­ers should take note of.</p>
    <p>NO WILL</p>
    <p>Ms Pil­lay said: “If you don’t have a will in place, it be­comes a lit­tle bit com­pli­cated be­cause es­sen­tially, when a per­son passes on, things don’t just au­to­mat­i­cally get dis­trib­uted to their next of kin.</p>
    <p>“Ul­ti­mately, the whole point of ac­quir­ing as­sets is to en­sure there’s a tran­si­tion to your loved one.”</p>
    <p>With­out a plan and a will, the man­ner in which as­sets such as prop­erty are dis­trib­uted upon the demise of the owner will be de­cided by the courts.</p>
    <p>“Take a mar­ried cou­ple, no chil­dren, upon their demise, their as­sets will be 50 per cent to the spouse and 50 per cent to the sur­viv­ing par­ents in equal shares, but that may not be the ideal dis­tri­bu­tion method. You may want to give ev­ery­thing to the sur­viv­ing spouse, or give a por­tion to nieces and neph­ews.</p>
    <p>“So it’s im­por­tant for you to plan, to look into your own spe­cific fam­ily sit­u­a­tion and needs, and then de­ter­mine how you want your as­sets to be dis­trib­uted.”</p>
    <p>SIN­GLES</p>
    <p>Ms Pil­lay said: “For sin­gles, the dis­tri­bu­tion would be ac­cord­ing to the in­tes­tacy laws based on next of kin. So, if you are sin­gle, you have no chil­dren, then ev­ery­thing goes to the par­ents. If there are no par­ents, then it goes to your sib­lings, and so on.</p>
    <p>“Again, this is some­thing that has to be looked into care­fully be­cause we’ve done so many wills for clients who are sin­gle and a lot of times, they want to pro­vide more for cer­tain sib­lings who have a par­tic­u­lar need. They also want to pro­vide for spe­cific neph­ews or nieces or even char­i­ta­ble or­gan­i­sa­tions.”</p>
    <p>SET­TING UP A TRUST</p>
    <p>Ms Pil­lay added: “Many Sin­ga­pore­ans and for­eign­ers are buy­ing prop­er­ties in trust for their chil­dren, and that usu­ally arises when the par­ents want to gift real es­tate to their chil­dren who are still mi­nors.</p>
    <p>“In Sin­ga­pore, you need to be 21 years old and above to own prop­erty. So it could be due to suc­ces­sion plan­ning rea­sons... or it could be that the par­ents want to en­sure the chil­dren have a roof over their heads, with­out hav­ing to con­tend with prop­erty prices sky­rock­et­ing by the time the chil­dren turn 21.</p>
    <p>“The only way they can do that is to em­ploy the means of the trust arrangemen­t to hold the prop­erty as the le­gal owner while the child is still a mi­nor.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, buy­ers who want to place prop­er­ties un­der a trust will have to cough up cash, as banks do not usu­ally fi­nance this sort of pur­chase, added Ms Pil­lay.</p>
    <p>Prop­erty in Sin­ga­pore has gen­er­ally been seen as a good hedge against short-term eco­nomic un­cer­tain­ties and a good as­set class for in­ter-gen­er­a­tional trans­fers, said Guo­coLand gen­eral man­ager Dora Chng.</p>
    <p>“In my view, prop­erty will al­ways be an ef­fec­tive hedge in the mid- to long-term pe­riod. Sin­ga­pore’s ap­peal as a busi­ness launch pad means the Sin­ga­pore dol­lar is very much in de­mand, look­ing at the his­tory of our cur­rency. We ac­tu­ally an­tic­i­pate our buy­ers’ as­sets to ap­pre­ci­ate in the long term.”</p>
