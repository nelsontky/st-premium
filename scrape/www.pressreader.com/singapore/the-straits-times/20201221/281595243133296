    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Just hours af­ter United States Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo told a con­ser­va­tive ra­dio show host that “we can say pretty clearly it was the Rus­sians” be­hind the vast hack of the fed­eral gov­ern­ment and US in­dus­try, he was con­tra­dicted by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, who sought to muddy the in­tel­li­gence find­ings by rais­ing the pos­si­bil­ity that China was re­spon­si­ble.</p>
    <p>De­fy­ing the con­clu­sions of ex­perts in­side and out­side the gov­ern­ment who say the at­tack was a cy­ber-se­cu­rity breach on a scale that Wash­ing­ton has never ex­pe­ri­enced, Mr Trump played down the sever­ity of the hack, say­ing in a tweet that “ev­ery­thing is well un­der con­trol” and in­sist­ing the me­dia has ex­ag­ger­ated the dam­age.</p>
    <p>With 30 days left in of­fice, Mr Trump’s dis­mis­sive state­ments on Satur­day made clear there would be no se­ri­ous ef­fort by his ad­min­is­tra­tion to pun­ish Rus­sia for the hack, and na­tional se­cu­rity of­fi­cials say they are all but cer­tain to hand off the fall­out and re­sponse to Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Amid a pan­demic, Mr Bi­den will in­herit a gov­ern­ment so laced with elec­tronic tunnels bored by Rus­sian in­tel­li­gence that it may be months, years even, be­fore he can trust the sys­tems that run much of Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>The US is more re­liant than al­most any other na­tion on frag­ile com­puter net­works that make the gov­ern­ment and econ­omy hum, mak­ing it an es­pe­cially ripe tar­get for short-of-war at­tacks like the one by the Krem­lin.</p>
    <p>In con­trast to Mr Trump, who has al­ways been re­luc­tant to con­front Moscow and Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin, Mr Bi­den has sig­nalled that he will not let the in­tru­sion, whose full ex­tent is not yet known, go unan­swered.</p>
    <p>“A good de­fence isn’t enough,” Mr Bi­den said last Thurs­day, vow­ing to im­pose “sub­stan­tial costs on those re­spon­si­ble for such ma­li­cious at­tacks”.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s tweet was his first com­ment on the hack, which came to light a week ago. Pri­vately, the Pres­i­dent has called the hack a “hoax”, and pres­sured as­so­ci­ates to down­play its sig­nif­i­cance and push al­ter­nate the­o­ries for who is re­spon­si­ble, two peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the ex­changes said.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s un­ex­plained re­luc­tance to blame Rus­sia – which through its em­bassy in Wash­ing­ton has de­nied com­plic­ity in the at­tack – has only com­pli­cated the re­sponse, in­ves­ti­ga­tors say.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment only learnt of the hack from FireEye, a cy­ber-se­cu­rity firm, af­ter the firm it­self was breached. Mi­crosoft said gov­ern­ment agen­cies are ap­proach­ing FireEye – not the na­tional se­cu­rity es­tab­lish­ment – to un­der­stand the ex­tent of the Rus­sian breach.</p>
    <p>Mr Dmitri Alper­ovitch, co­founder of se­cu­rity firm CrowdStrik­e, who is now chair­man of think-tank Sil­ver­ado Pol­icy Ac­cel­er­a­tor, said: “This is the most con­se­quen­tial cy­ber-es­pi­onage cam­paign in his­tory, and the fact that the gov­ern­ment is ab­sent is a huge prob­lem for the na­tion. The re­sponse has been a to­tal dis­as­ter, not just be­cause of the Pres­i­dent... There’s no co­or­di­na­tion, and ev­ery agency is just do­ing what­ever they can to help them­selves.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s com­ments had echoes of his stance to­wards the hacks dur­ing the 2016 pres­i­den­tial cam­paign, when he con­tra­dicted in­tel­li­gence find­ings to claim it was China, or a “400 pound” per­son “sit­ting on his bed”, and not Rus­sia, who in­ter­fered in that elec­tion. Two years later, his own Jus­tice Depart­ment in­dicted 12 Rus­sian in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>All coun­tries spy on one an­other and, for now, that ap­pears to have been the first ob­jec­tive of the Rus­sian cam­paign – one that ex­perts said ap­pears to date back to Oc­to­ber last year.</p>
    <p>That was when hack­ers, pre­sumed to be work­ing for Rus­sia’s elite spy agency SVR, first broke into the So­larWinds net­work man­age­ment soft­ware, which is used across the US fed­eral gov­ern­ment and by three quar­ters of the na­tion’s For­tune 500 firms.</p>
    <p>Gen­eral Paul Naka­sone, com­man­der of the US Cy­ber Com­mand and one of the na­tion’s most ex­pe­ri­enced cy­ber war­riors, has yet to com­ment in pub­lic on what went wrong.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Democrats have pushed for an ag­gres­sive re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Sen­a­tor Martin Hein­rich of New Mex­ico, home to the Los Alamos nu­clear lab that the Rus­sians breached in the at­tack, said: “Given the grav­ity of this breach, it’s con­cern­ing that Pres­i­dent Trump is pay­ing so lit­tle at­ten­tion to it.”</p>
