    <p>Par­lia­ment passed a law yes­ter­day giv­ing doc­tors a clearer idea on what they need to tell pa­tients, so that they need not fear lit­i­ga­tion or re­sort to de­fen­sive medicine when they over­load pa­tients with in­for­ma­tion or ex­pose them to more tests than they need. The move would help avoid poorer care and hold down health­care costs.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment passed a law yes­ter­day giv­ing doc­tors a clearer idea of what they need to tell pa­tients, so that they need not fear lit­i­ga­tion or re­sort to de­fen­sive medicine by over­load­ing pa­tients with in­for­ma­tion or ex­pos­ing them to more tests than they need.</p>
    <p>The move would help pre­vent poorer care and hold down health­care costs.</p>
    <p>Es­sen­tially, the change says doc­tors need to tell pa­tients only what they “would rea­son­ably re­quire to make an in­formed de­ci­sion”, said Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Law Ed­win Tong when he ear­lier pre­sented the Civil Law (Amend­ment) Bill for de­bate in the House.</p>
    <p>On top of that, doc­tors have to an­swer ques­tions pa­tients ask, even if they think it is mi­nor, as what is im­por­tant varies among pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The re­la­tion­ship be­tween pa­tient and doc­tor is one based on trust, but Mr Tong noted that in re­cent years, this has been “called into ques­tion fol­low­ing sev­eral wellpub­li­cised medico-le­gal cases from the Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal Coun­cil (SMC) dis­ci­plinary tri­bunals”.</p>
    <p>They in­clude the case of Dr Lim Lian Arn, who was found guilty and fined $100,000 for not ob­tain­ing in­formed con­sent from his pa­tient.</p>
    <p>An SMC dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal said he had failed to ad­vise a pa­tient on the risks and pos­si­ble com­pli­ca­tions of a steroid in­jec­tion and some of the side ef­fects sub­se­quently man­i­fested in the pa­tient.</p>
    <p>Dr Lim’s con­vic­tion was over­turned, on ap­peal, by the Court of Three Judges. But the case led to many doc­tors be­com­ing uncer­tain about what is re­quired of them when ad­vis­ing pa­tients, and say­ing they would prac­tise de­fen­sive medicine to pro­tect them­selves.</p>
    <p>Ques­tions also arose on whether the case should have gone to the tri­bunal in the first place, and the court la­belled the con­vic­tion a “mis­car­riage of justice”.</p>
    <p>“When­ever dis­ci­plinary out­comes di­verge from well-es­tab­lished prac­tices by doc­tors on pa­tient care in the med­i­cal com­mu­nity, un­cer­tainty fol­lows,” Mr Tong noted.</p>
    <p>To re­store trust be­tween doc­tor and pa­tient, and the trust of doc­tors in the med­i­cal dis­ci­plinary sys­tem, an­other law was amended too – the Med­i­cal Reg­is­tra­tion Act.</p>
    <p>This was done through the Med­i­cal Reg­is­tra­tion (Amend­ment) Bill, which aims to strengthen the medi</p>
    <p>Es­sen­tially, the change says doc­tors need to tell pa­tients only what they “would rea­son­ably re­quire to make an in­formed de­ci­sion”, said Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Law Ed­win Tong when he ear­lier pre­sented the Civil Law (Amend­ment) Bill for de­bate in the House.</p>
    <p>On top of that, doc­tors have to an­swer ques­tions pa­tients ask, even if they think it is mi­nor, as what is im­por­tant varies among pa­tients.</p>
    <p>cal dis­ci­plinary process. Like the Civil Law (Amend­ment) Bill, it was passed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A NEW TEST</p>
    <p>The Civil Law (Amend­ment) Bill sets out the two cri­te­ria doc­tors need to ful­fil in giv­ing med­i­cal ad­vice to pa­tients.</p>
    <p>One, they must act in a log­i­cal man­ner that is ac­cepted by a body of their peers. This is to as­sure them that their con­duct will be as­sessed by fel­low doc­tors.</p>
    <p>Two, they must give in­for­ma­tion that a pa­tient would rea­son­ably re­quire, or that is ma­te­rial to a pa­tient in mak­ing an in­formed de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>This means ad­dress­ing any ques­tion asked by the pa­tient.</p>
    <p>“The pa­tient can be as­sured that when he walks into a clinic and sees a doc­tor, there re­ally are no stupid ques­tions. Ev­ery ques­tion that this pa­tient raises with this doc­tor is a valid, rel­e­vant ques­tion that has to be ad­dressed,” said Mr Tong.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the in­abil­ity to use the lit­tle fin­ger might seem mi­nor to a doc­tor, but could af­fect the liveli­hood of a pro­fes­sional pi­anist.</p>
    <p>Even when the pa­tient does not ex­press a con­cern, if the doc­tor has ac­cess to med­i­cal records that show such a con­cern should have been raised, he must ad­dress it.</p>
    <p>What is rea­son­able must be as­sessed in the con­text of each case, Mr Tong added.</p>
    <p>STRENGTH­EN­ING THE DIS­CI­PLINARY PROCESS</p>
    <p>The Med­i­cal Reg­is­tra­tion (Amend­ment) Bill is based on the rec­om­men­da­tions of a work group set up in March last year by the Health Min­istry to re­view the SMC’s dis­ci­plinary process.</p>
    <p>It has four main ob­jec­tives:</p>
    <p>• to im­prove the qual­ity and con­sis­tency of the dis­ci­plinary process;</p>
    <p>• to re­duce de­lays;</p>
    <p>• to pro­tect pa­tients bet­ter,</p>
    <p>• to en­cour­age me­di­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The pass­ing of the Bill pro­vides for the ap­point­ment of a Dis­ci­plinary Com­mis­sion that is in­de­pen­dent and sep­a­rate from the SMC and headed by a senior doc­tor.</p>
    <p>The com­mis­sion will take over the SMC’s role in set­ting up the dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal. This should ad­dress con­cerns that the tri­bunals are not in­de­pen­dent of the SMC, said Mr Tong.</p>
    <p>The tri­bunals will have a le­gal pro­fes­sional sit­ting on it. For com­plex cases, the com­mis­sion may ask for a judge or ju­di­cial com­mis­sioner of the Supreme Court to chair it.</p>
    <p>An­other change ad­dresses the con­cern that prose­cut­ing lawyers some­times go for con­vic­tion at all costs, and seek overly se­vere penalties.</p>
    <p>The SMC will now re­place the 10 law firms it had used with a Le­gal Ad­vi­sory and Pros­e­cu­tion Unit which, over time, should bet­ter un­der­stand the dis­ci­plinary process and ap­pro­pri­ate penalties.</p>
    <p>Not­ing the con­stant feed­back of un­rea­son­able de­lay in the dis­ci­plinary process, Mr Tong had pointed to sev­eral mea­sures aimed at re­solv­ing the is­sue.</p>
    <p>These in­clude no­ti­fy­ing the doc­tor early when a com­plaint has been made against him, and re­quir­ing rel­e­vant doc­u­ments and ev­i­dence to be sub­mit­ted in a timely man­ner.</p>
    <p>An­other new move is that the SMC will de­cide whether a dis­ci­plinary hear­ing is needed, fol­low­ing a Com­plaints Com­mit­tee’s find­ings.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, the de­ci­sion is made by the Com­plaints Com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>To pro­tect pa­tients more ef­fec­tively, in­ves­ti­ga­tors now have to report to the SMC if they dis­cover wrong­do­ing not re­lated to the ini­tial com­plaint.</p>
    <p>The new law also en­cour­ages am­i­ca­ble res­o­lu­tion of com­plaints and fa­cil­i­tates a less ad­ver­sar­ial dis­ci­plinary process.</p>
    <p>The new Med­i­cal Reg­is­tra­tion Act al­lows an in­quiry com­mit­tee to re­fer com­plaints which are not about se­ri­ous pro­fes­sional mis­con­duct re­quir­ing dis­ci­plinary ac­tion, for me­di­a­tion.</p>
