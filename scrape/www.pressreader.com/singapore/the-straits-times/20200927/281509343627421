    <p>Cult dough­nuts are the new con­cert tick­ets. While con­certs may have taken a back seat, th­ese highly cov­eted sweet treats re­quire the same l evel of pre-plan­ning and even camp­ing at your com­puter to score them. If you snooze, you lose.</p>
    <p>Home-grown Sour­bombe Ar­ti­sanal Bak­ery’s sour­dough bom­boloni – or Ital­ian stuffed dough­nuts – once sold out in less than a minute. Th­ese are re­leased on its on­line store ev­ery Mon­day at noon and sell out within 10 min­utes ev­ery week.</p>
    <p>The bak­ery arm of Miche­lin­starred restau­rant Burnt Ends now has a wait list of two to three weeks for its stuffed brioche dough­nuts, which are sold only on its on­line store.</p>
    <p>It started sell­ing dough­nuts at a week­end mar­ket in Dempsey Hill in March 2018, but ramped up pro­duc­tion to meet ris­ing on­line de­mand dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, at hole-in-the-wall bak­ery Ko­rio at Far East Square in Amoy Street, its Amer­i­can-style glazed brioche dough­nuts sell out by 12.30pm, or ear­lier, ev­ery day. A queue usu­ally starts at about 10.30am on week­days or as early as 9am on a Saturday.</p>
    <p>Un­like mass-pro­duced dough­nuts by chains that are avail­able at malls, th­ese ar­ti­sanal dough­nuts are hand­made in small batches with higher-qual­ity in­gre­di­ents and unique flavour combinatio­ns – which also trans­late to heftier prices. They typ­i­cally cost $4 to $5 a pop.</p>
    <p>A box of nine Sour­bombe – in flavours like Basque burnt cheese­cake, laven­der lime mas­car­pone and Thai tea mango – goes for $44.</p>
    <p>Ko­rio bakes 200 dough­nuts daily. Its pan­dan and salted gula me­laka, and peanut but­ter and jelly glazed dough­nuts sell at $4.50 each.</p>
    <p>Burnt Ends Bak­ery’s best-sell­ing box of mixed stuffed dough­nuts – flavoured with nutella, pas­sion­fruit and vanilla cream – re­tails at $24 for half a dozen. The bak­ery now pumps out 6,000 to 7,000 dough­nuts ev­ery month.</p>
    <p>Sour­bombe’s co-founder is Genevieve Lee, 23, who is known for her stint on MasterChef Sin­ga­pore, where she was the run­ner-up.</p>
    <p>She at­tributes the cult dough­nut boom to dis­cern­ing Sin­ga­porean palates.</p>
    <p>“Good dough­nuts are not ev­ery­where... small bak­eries are all ar­ti­sanal and you can re­ally taste the dif­fer­ence,” she says.</p>
    <p>She started mak­ing dough­nuts two years ago as a sig­na­ture dish of hers and took them to friends’ homes. More re­cently, they fea­tured in the care pack­ages that she sent to friends dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Two months ago, she launched her on­line dough­nut busi­ness. As­sisted by fam­ily mem­bers, she now makes about 800 bom­boloni a week, us­ing proofed and han­drolled sour­dough – which gives them a slight tang.</p>
    <p>“In us­ing sour­dough, the whole flavour pro­file changes so it doesn’t just taste like plain old white bread. In­stead it be­comes a sour­ish, salty, al­most umami kind of bite,” she says.</p>
    <p>She also fries the bom­boloni in co­conut oil in­stead of veg­etable oil, so they are crispy on the out­side and soft and chewy on the in­side, which sets them apart in tex­ture from reg­u­lar dough­nuts.</p>
    <p>They are then filled with silky cus­tards flavoured with matcha and oo­long tea and bits of adzuki beans – or her per­sonal favourite, blue­berry and lemon thyme.</p>
    <p>For her Basque burnt cheese­cake dough­nut, which pays homage to the cult cake with molten in­sides, she sous vides cheese and egg cus­tard “un­til it has a per­fect con­sis­tency” be­fore she pipes it into the dough­nut, then blow­torches it to get the “burnt” ef­fect.</p>
    <p>De­liv­er­ies go out on Wed­nes­days and Satur­days, or cus­tomers can pick up the dough­nuts from Lee Fun Nam Kee, her father’s fa­mous soya sauce chicken rice restau­rant in Toa Payoh.</p>
    <p>If not for the pan­demic, Ms Lee would have headed to New York ear­lier this year for a four-month in­tern­ship at the renowned farm­stead restau­rant Blue Hill at Stone Barns. “But if I didn’t stay in Sin­ga­pore, I wouldn’t have opened Sour­bombe... so I choose to find the sil­ver lin­ing,” she says.</p>
    <p>Just last week, she com­pleted her bach­e­lor’s de­gree in culi­nary busi­ness at the Culi­nary In­sti­tute of Amer­ica’s Sin­ga­pore cam­pus, which means she can now fo­cus fully on her boom­ing busi­ness.</p>
    <p>She is also look­ing to scale up and is sourc­ing for a cen­tral kitchen with co-founder C.R. Tan, 29, a food stylist and pho­tog­ra­pher.</p>
    <p>As part of the ex­pan­sion, she is look­ing into mak­ing her dough­nuts with ha­lal-friendly gelatin op­tions.</p>
    <p>The ris­ing ap­petite for dough­nuts is also be­ing met by a slew of home­based on­line bak­ers like The Fat Kid Bak­ery (@the­fatkid­bak­ery), which takes pre-or­ders for sour­dough bom­boloni three to five days be­fore de­liv­ery or col­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>There are also plenty of ha­lal and Mus­lim-owned op­tions like Fluff Bak­ery in the Bugis area, whose stuffed dough­nuts sell out ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>Join­ing the ranks of home bak­ers are Dough & Bat­ter, which serves sweet (salted caramel hon­ey­comb) and savoury (sam­bal) bom­boloni, while Welovedel­ish’s se­lec­tion of pil­lowy dough­nuts come in flavours like durian pen­gat, pas­sion­fruit mango curd and straw­berry. Both on­line busi­nesses are on In­sta­gram and or­ders can be placed via What­sApp.</p>
    <p>But the fron­trun­ners are not rest­ing on their lau­rels.</p>
    <p>Burnt Ends head baker Teresa Tan, 34, is con­stantly do­ing re­search and de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“De­pend­ing on the sea­son, we try to switch the fill­ings up with the fruit that our sup­plier can get,” she says. “We also get cus­tomer feed­back to see what flavours the pub­lic are lean­ing to­wards.”</p>
    <p>Past flavours have in­cluded plum jam and lemon curd, while cus­tomers have re­quested flavours like durian and mango lassi.</p>
    <p>It does not look like the dough­nut craze is sub­sid­ing any time soon.</p>
    <p>Ms Shaz Hen­shaw, 25, co­founder of Ko­rio, says: “Sin­ga­pore­ans know their food and I guess word gets around fast when peo­ple find some­thing they re­ally en­joy.”</p>
    <p>Dough­nut lovers like Mr Alex Tan, 55, direc­tor of home decor and lifestyle store Strange & Deranged, or­ders any­thing from two to four boxes from home-based busi­ness The Fat Kid Bak­ery twice a month for him­self and to give away to friends and clients.</p>
    <p>“What I like about this busi­ness is that if a batch of dough­nuts turns out bad, baker Ariel Tang will tell you she is not sell­ing it,” says Mr Tan. “It’s ar­ti­sanal, but it’s also hon­est, and when you give it to friends, you know you’re giv­ing them good stuff.”</p>
