    <p>Many thought jockey Louis-Philippe Beuzelin has lost his job on the Joe Gio­vanni Sar­jeet Singh-owned mul­ti­ple-Group win­ner Countof­mon­te­cristo, af­ter their third plac­ing as the $11 favourite in the Group 1 Kranji Mile on Aug 16.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, the French­man had ad­mit­ted it was not one of his best rides. The horse, who had been rid­den by more than a dozen dif­fer­ent jockeys be­fore, raced wide. Crit­ics also blamed Beuzelin for hit­ting the front too early in the $1 mil­lion race.</p>
    <p>“The Count”, as the 10-time win­ner is pop­u­larly called, was trans­ferred from trainer Michael Cle­ments to trainer Mark Walker af­ter the race.</p>
    <p>But it emerged that Beuzelin was not the col­lat­eral dam­age from the Cle­ments-Singh split. He gets to seek re­demp­tion in to­day’s $400,000 Group 1 Raf­fles Cup over 1,600m in Race 10 at Kranji.</p>
    <p>Al­though he has won five fea­ture races, Countof­mon­te­cristo is aim­ing for his first Group 1 suc­cess.</p>
    <p>“The Fri­day af­ter the Kranji Mile, Mr Gio­vanni told me he was mov­ing Countof­mon­te­cristo to Mark Walker, but I would still con­tinue to ride him,” said Beuzelin, who rode the big-hearted Kiwi-bred to vic­tory in the Group 2 Chair­man’s Trophy over 1,600m on Feb 15.</p>
    <p>“At his last start, it was al­ready agreed that an ap­pren­tice jockey would ride be­cause of the 59kg. It was a log­i­cal de­ci­sion to get the 3kg claim.</p>
    <p>“I’m very grate­ful to Mr Gio­vanni and thank­ful for his pro­fes­sion­al­ism, as I re­ally wanted to carry on rid­ing his horse.”</p>
    <p>Beuzelin said the horse has be­come very spe­cial to him.</p>
    <p>“We’ve had very good re­sults to­gether, in­clud­ing win­ning the Group 2 Chair­man’s Trophy and the Class 1 race (July 11).</p>
    <p>“I have also learnt a lot about the horse, not only af­ter the Kranji Mile, but as a whole, and that’s a huge as­set.</p>
    <p>“I know his strengths, but also his Achilles heel. I have a much bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of him and I will give him my 100 per cent in the Raf­fles Cup.”</p>
    <p>Beuzelin is hope­ful, af­ter his mount did a good gal­lop with sta­ble­mate Beau Geste for com­pany on the turf track on Tues­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>“The horse is in very good form. He did a nice 1,000m work­out, gal­lop­ing along­side Beau Geste all the way to the line,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It was an in-depth main­te­nance gal­lop, as he hasn’t raced for al­most a month. I didn’t want to ask him to do too much or too lit­tle, just the happy medium.</p>
    <p>“It will just help bring on his fit­ness un­til race-day. Things went well, 100 per cent.”</p>
    <p>To­day’s Raf­fles Cup may look quite open with some big names in it, but Countof­mon­te­cristo will still be one of the fan­cied run­ners.</p>
