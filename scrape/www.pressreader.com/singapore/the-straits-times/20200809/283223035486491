    <p>The ex­traor­di­nar­ily low in­ter­est rates in place today are a boon when you’re buy­ing a house, re­fi­nanc­ing a mort­gage, leas­ing a car or pay­ing off stu­dent debt. If you qual­ify for a loan, low rates can help you spend less and get more.</p>
    <p>But there is a dark side to fall­ing in­ter­est rates. While they are help­ful for qual­i­fied bor­row­ers – and have con­tributed to tremen­dous re­turns for peo­ple who have held bonds for many years – they are ter­ri­ble for savers.</p>
    <p>Live on less, dip deeply into sav­ings or take on more risk in the stock mar­ket: Those are the nasty choices that many peo­ple will prob­a­bly be fac­ing. The dilemma is most press­ing for those plan­ning for re­tire­ment or al­ready in it.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple who have done ev­ery­thing right, and man­aged to put away some money, didn’t ex­pect this, but they’re in a tough spot,” said Mr Wil­liam Bern­stein, an in­vest­ment ad­viser and au­thor.</p>
    <p>“A lot of them will have to con­sume less in their golden years, un­less this turns around.” The fun­da­men­tal prob­lem is that with in­ter­est rates as low as they have ever been, peo­ple with modest nest eggs can’t get much safe in­come.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est on new US gov­ern­ment bonds, which paid more than 6 per cent 20 years ago, has dropped to laugh­ably low lev­els – be­tween 0.7 per cent and 1.3 per cent an­nu­ally.</p>
    <p>That means that if you stash your US$1 mil­lion (S$1.38 mil­lion) nest egg in long-term bonds, you could count on an in­come stream of only less than US$13,000 a year.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion for savers isn’t likely to im­prove soon. In­ter­est rates are so low largely be­cause the econ­omy is so weak. That eco­nomic frailty has dam­aged other im­por­tant sources of in­vestor in­come as well.</p>
    <p>Div­i­dends are shrink­ing. S&P 500 div­i­dends are ex­pected to be slashed by 25 per cent to more than 30 per cent in the cur­rent down­turn. That im­plies in­vestors could col­lec­tively l ose be­tween US$100 bil­lion and US$150 bil­lion in div­i­dend cuts in this re­ces­sion, on top of losses from stock price de­clines.</p>
    <p>Low in­ter­est rates have also re­duced the pay­out from com­mer­cially avail­able an­nu­ities, an­other im­por­tant source of in­vestor in­come. The sim­plest of them, known as sin­gle pre­mium im­me­di­ate an­nu­ities, are essen­tially bonds wrapped in in­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>With these ba­sic an­nu­ities, an in­sur­ance com­pany will pro­vide you with in­come, for as long as you live, in ex­change for a sum of cash.</p>
    <p>But be­cause of low in­ter­est rates, the pay­out on com­mer­cial an­nu­ities has fallen by more than 50 per cent over the last 30 years.</p>
    <p>In New York, for ex­am­ple, a 65-year-old man would get only US$494 a month, or US$5,928 a year, in re­turn for a US$100,000 pay­ment, ac­cord­ing to Im­me­di­ateAn­nu­ities.com, an in­de­pen­dent site that tracks these rates.</p>
    <p>You might think in­ter­est rates are al­ready so low that they must start ris­ing, so the best strat­egy is to wait be­fore mak­ing de­ci­sions about bonds, stocks, an­nu­ities or other as­sets. That’s log­i­cal, but you may have to wait a long time.</p>
    <p>Con­sider that the fu­tures mar­kets have been pre­dict­ing the US Fed­eral Re­serve will take short-term rates even lower, in fact, be­low zero. Rates be­low zero are known as neg­a­tive in­ter­est rates; you would have to pay some­one in­ter­est for the priv­i­lege of lend­ing them money.</p>
    <p>That has not hap­pened in the United States but it is al­ready the case for many bonds in Ger­many</p>
    <p>In­ter­est on new US gov­ern­ment bonds, which paid more than 6 per cent 20 years ago, has dropped to laugh­ably low lev­els – be­tween 0.7 per cent and 1.3 per cent an­nu­ally. That means that if you stash your US$1 mil­lion (S$1.38 mil­lion) nest egg in long-term bonds, you could count on an in­come stream of only less than US$13,000 a year.</p>
    <p>and Ja­pan, and it is a sign of se­vere eco­nomic dis­tress.</p>
    <p>Even if in­ter­est rates don’t turn neg­a­tive, they are likely to re­main low for some time, mir­ing many in­vestors in a quandary.</p>
    <p>For one thing, bonds are likely to be less at­trac­tive than they have been. Bonds have pro­duced out­size re­turns over the past two decades – with many cat­e­gories beat­ing the stock mar­ket – pre­cisely be­cause in­ter­est rates fell.</p>
    <p>The rea­son is that bond prices and in­ter­est rates move in op­po­site di­rec­tions. Mu­tual fund in­vestors have ben­e­fited be­cause the to­tal re­turn on bonds is a com­bi­na­tion of in­ter­est (also known as “yield”) and the shift in the price of the bonds.</p>
    <p>If rates turn neg­a­tive, that would mean im­me­di­ate prof­its for those who al­ready own bonds and bond funds, but pur­chasers of those se­cu­ri­ties would lose in­come, not col­lect it.</p>
    <p>Even­tu­ally, rates can be ex­pected to rise, but buy­ing bonds or bond funds be­fore that hap­pens would im­ply losses down the road.</p>
    <p>With the ap­peal of bonds dimmed, some peo­ple will be tempted to shift money into stocks. That was one of the un­stated goals of the Fed when it cut rates in the last fi­nan­cial cri­sis, and the cen­tral bank’s in­ter­ven­tion since March 23 has bol­stered stocks again.</p>
    <p>But stock prices, by many mea­sures, are not cheap, and buy­ing in a re­ces­sion is risky. For peo­ple whose main con­cern is pre­serv­ing their nest egg, adding stock ex­po­sure may be too dan­ger­ous.</p>
    <p>It is a dif­fer­ent mat­ter for those with the lux­ury of long hori­zons. Tak­ing on greater stock risk may make sense for them.</p>
    <p>Find­ing a com­fort­able al­lo­ca­tion of stocks and bonds and stick­ing with it is clas­sic ad­vice and most likely to work in the fu­ture, if you have plenty of time.</p>
    <p>But for those who can­not af­ford that lux­ury, a world of low in­ter­est rates means prob­lems ga­lore.</p>
