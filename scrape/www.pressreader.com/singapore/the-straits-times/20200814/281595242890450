    <p>About one in six mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries con­tracted Covid-19, a tally of cases showed, but the true in­fec­tion rate could be higher than that. One in six is also not enough for herd im­mu­nity, said ex­perts.</p>
    <p>About one in six for­eign work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries con­tracted Covid-19, a cal­cu­la­tion based on Sin­ga­pore’s of­fi­cial tally showed, but the true in­fec­tion rate in the dor­mi­to­ries is likely to be higher than this, ex­perts say.</p>
    <p>If ac­cu­rate, how­ever, an in­fec­tion rate of one in six would not be enough for herd im­mu­nity to de­velop in the mi­grant worker pop­u­la­tion, they added.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 52,425 out of 323,000 work­ers had been in­fected as of Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>In most coun­tries, the num­ber of “cryp­tic” in­fec­tions – which are in­fec­tions missed by the of­fi­cial case count – is prob­a­bly around five to 10 times greater than the num­ber of of­fi­cially di­ag­nosed cases, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Alex Cook, vice-dean of re­search at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health.</p>
    <p>They oc­cur be­cause an in­di­vid­ual with a neg­a­tive re­sult at the point of test­ing may be­come in­fected in the fu­ture or may have re­cov­ered from a pre­vi­ous in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the close mon­i­tor­ing of the out­break in the dor­mi­to­ries by hos­pi­tals and the multi-min­istry task force, in­clud­ing test­ing ev­ery worker, would mean that there are fewer cryp­tic in­fec­tions among that pop­u­la­tion than in the gen­eral pop­u­la­tion here or else­where, Prof Cook said.</p>
    <p>The only way to know the true in­fec­tion rate would be to con­duct large-scale sero­log­i­cal tests.</p>
    <p>These in­volve tak­ing a small amount of blood and test­ing it for an­ti­bod­ies that in­di­cate a past in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>“Un­til the re­sults of sero­log­i­cal stud­ies be­come avail­able, we can’t tell whether in­fec­tions are just a lit­tle more than 52,000 and we iden­ti­fied al­most all of the cases, or whether there are four or five times as many in­fec­tions as cases,” Prof Cook added.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said that given that most in­fected for­eign work­ers are asymp­to­matic or mildly symp­to­matic, and be­long to a gen­er­ally young and healthy de­mo­graphic, it is even more likely that some of these in­fected pa­tients do not know that they had the virus, re­sult­ing in un­der-re­port­ing of dor­mi­tory cases.</p>
    <p>Prof Cook said that for herd im­mu­nity to be achieved in any pop­u­la­tion, around half of its mem­bers would need to be in­fected. For dor­mi­to­ries, given the high den­sity, around 70 per cent to 80 per cent of each dor­mi­tory would have to be in­fected.</p>
    <p>But herd im­mu­nity may not be a so­lu­tion to Covid-19, as re­in­fec­tion may still hap­pen and achiev­ing that im­mu­nity would come at great cost to a coun­try.</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple might be se­verely in­fected or die, rais­ing ques­tions about the vi­a­bil­ity of this strat­egy, Prof Cook said.</p>
    <p>Prof Teo said an added com­pli­ca­tion is that there is also no clear ev­i­dence to sup­port the hy­poth­e­sis that im­mu­nity would pro­vide last­ing pro­tec­tion against the virus.</p>
    <p>“There is some ev­i­dence to sug­gest some de­gree of im­mu­nity is con­ferred for at least three months after be­ing in­fected, but be­yond that, I don’t think we know enough to set any pol­icy that will be com­pletely re­liant on as­sump­tions about post-in­fec­tion im­mu­nity,” he said.</p>
    <p>Tra­di­tion­ally, herd im­mu­nity has been one of the ways to pro­tect pop­u­la­tions against in­fec­tions. It can be achieved through ex­po­sure to and in­fec­tion by the virus, or through vac­ci­na­tion, Prof Teo ex­plained.</p>
    <p>A safe and ef­fec­tive vac­cine is the way out of Covid-19, many coun­tries have con­cluded.</p>
    <p>“The re­al­ity is that we will not achieve herd im­mu­nity in the next three months, and what this means is that coun­tries will need to con­tinue to in­vest in all the nec­es­sary mea­sures to en­sure that the peo­ple are pro­tected from the virus, while al­low­ing them to con­tinue liv­ing with as near a de­gree of nor­malcy as pos­si­ble,” Prof Teo said.</p>
    <p>This would mean hav­ing to cast the net wide and ring-fence a large num­ber of cases should there be a con­firmed case.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the Min­istry of Health an­nounced on Wed­nes­day night that 800 for­eign work­ers had been quar­an­tined after a new case was dis­cov­ered among them in a cleared dor­mi­tory, show­ing how the task force quickly iso­lated and quar­an­tined all at-risk work­ers who might have come into con­tact with the in­fected worker.</p>
