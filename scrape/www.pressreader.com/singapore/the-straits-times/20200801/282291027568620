    <p>• Rac­ing Point’s Ser­gio Perez, who will miss to­mor­row’s Bri­tish Grand Prix af­ter be­com­ing the first For­mula One driver to test pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus since the start of the sea­son, re­vealed yes­ter­day that he flew back to Mex­ico af­ter the pre­vi­ous race in Hun­gary.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Cana­di­anowned, Bri­tish-based t eam on Thurs­day de­nied that was the case.</p>
    <p>But in a video mes­sage on Twit­ter, Perez ad­mit­ted he had taken a pri­vate plane home de­spite his coun­try be­ing among the worst af­fected by Covid-19, with over 416,000 cases and 46,000 deaths as of yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He claimed that he had to see his mother for two days af­ter she suf­fered an ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>“As soon as she left hos­pi­tal. I was able to see her. And then I came back to Europe. Same way, with all the pro­to­cols in place. I just got it, I don’t know from where. I have no symp­toms at all,” the 30-year-old said.</p>
    <p>Perez, who is now in self-iso­la­tion and also likely to miss the fol­low­ing 70th An­niver­sary Grand Prix at Sil­ver­stone next week­end, called his in­fec­tion “one of the sad­dest days in my ca­reer”.</p>
    <p>“The amount of prepa­ra­tion that we put into this week­end, to be 100 per cent ready for it, I knew I had a great car un­der­neath me and the team have done a fan­tas­tic job,” he said. “I’m re­ally sad that this hap­pened, but this just shows just how vul­ner­a­ble we are all to this virus.”</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, the sport’s rul­ing body, the FIA, said: “The (safety) pro­ce­dures set out have pro­vided for swift con­tain­ment of an in­ci­dent that will have no wider im­pact on this week­end’s event.”</p>
    <p>Rac­ing Point’s car, a close copy of last year’s win­ning Mercedes al­beit in pink, is ex­pected to go well at their home track – the first high­speed cir­cuit of a sea­son de­layed by more than four months be­cause of the Covid-19 cri­sis. And Ger­man Nico Hulken­berg will be the Mex­i­can’s stand-in at Sil­ver­stone.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing raced for Rac­ing Point when they were known as Force In­dia from 2014 to 2016, the vet­eran of 177 grands prix is in­ti­mately fa­mil­iar with the team and prin­ci­pal</p>
    <p>Ot­mar Szaf­nauer is con­fi­dent that Perez’s un­fore­seen ab­sence will not prove to be a hin­drance.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing to find a re­place­ment for Ser­gio at short no­tice is no easy task, but in Nico, we’ve got a fan­tas­tic su­per-sub who the team knows very well,” he said of the 32-yearold, who last raced for Re­nault last year.</p>
    <p>Hulken­berg told re­porters he was sorry to hear that his for­mer team­mate had been struck down by the virus, but re­it­er­ated his aim to seize his op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>“That (news) was less than 24 hours ago, so it feels a bit sur­real for me right now, but I like a good chal­lenge and this is cer­tainly one,” he said. “He’s a buddy of mine, an old team­mate and I wish him a speedy re­cov­ery.”</p>
    <p>He cer­tainly looked like he had never been away in first prac­tice yes­ter­day, ac­quit­ting him­self well and set­ting the ninth-fastest time de­spite some dis­com­fort from the seat.</p>
    <p>Red Bull’s Max Ver­stap­pen was the fastest in 1min 27.422sec, while six-time world cham­pion and leader Lewis Hamil­ton of Mercedes was sec­ond quick­est, 0.474sec off the pace.</p>
    <p>UP FOR A FIGHT</p>
    <p>That (news) was less than 24 hours ago, so it feels a bit sur­real for me right now, but I like a good chal­lenge and this is cer­tainly one. He’s a buddy of mine... and I wish him a speedy re­cov­ery. ’’</p>
    <p>NICO HULKEN­BERG, ex-Force In­dia racer who is re­plac­ing for­mer team­mate Ser­gio Perez at short no­tice.</p>
