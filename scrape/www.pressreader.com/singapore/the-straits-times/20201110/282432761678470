    <p>LON­DON • Gareth South­gate has backed mid­field­ers Declan Rice and Jack Gre­al­ish, and de­fender Michael Keane to have suc­cess­ful Eng­land ca­reers af­ter switch­ing their al­le­giance from Ire­land.</p>
    <p>The trio were all born in Eng­land but first played for Ire­land in some ca­pac­ity on ac­count of their Ir­ish an­ces­try.</p>
    <p>West Ham’s Rice earned three caps for Ire­land in friendlies, while Gre­al­ish of As­ton Villa and Ever­ton’s Keane both played for Ire­land’s youth teams be­fore com­mit­ting their fu­ture to Eng­land.</p>
    <p>The trio will now pre­pare to face Ire­land for the first time since their switch af­ter be­ing named in Eng­land’s squad for the Wem­b­ley friendly on Thurs­day, and the Three Lions man­ager has no doubts that they made the right de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>“I think the three boys we have with us, they look as if they can have good in­ter­na­tional ca­reers and we’re just fo­cus­ing on that part of it, re­ally,” he told the</p>
    <p>Bri­tish me­dia ahead of the game.</p>
    <p>“We’ve got a lot of th­ese sit­u­a­tions. We played Wales last month and they had a cou­ple of play­ers who were with us as young­sters: Tyler Roberts and Ethan Am­padu. We didn’t want to lose them.</p>
    <p>“I think ev­ery­body is fac­ing th­ese chal­lenges with dual na­tion­al­ity play­ers.</p>
    <p>“We’ve al­ways got to get the bal­ance right of not cap­ping them too early and just to stop them go­ing some­where else.”</p>
    <p>South­gate, how­ever, will not be able to call on Trent Alexan­derArnold af­ter the de­fender suf­fered a calf in­jury late on dur­ing Liver­pool’s 1-1 Premier League draw with Manchester City on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Reds man­ager Jur­gen Klopp said: “He will be out of Eng­land. Scan to­mor­row and then we will see.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter Ire­land, Eng­land travel to top-ranked Bel­gium for their Uefa Na­tions League A Group 2 clash on Sun­day be­fore host­ing Ice­land on Nov 18 to con­clude the round.</p>
