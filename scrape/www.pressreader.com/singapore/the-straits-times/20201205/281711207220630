    <p>Nightlife in Seoul will grind to a halt af­ter 9pm daily for two weeks from to­day, when stricter Covid-19 mea­sures take ef­fect, as South Korea con­tin­ues to strug­gle with a third wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>New re­stric­tions in­clude clos­ing all malls, movie the­atres, In­ter­net cafes, game ar­cades, beauty sa­lons and su­per­mar­kets from 9pm. Only con­ve­nience stores smaller than 300 sq m will be al­lowed to open at night.</p>
    <p>Buses will also cut their ca­pac­ity by 30 per cent af­ter 9pm, while sub­ways will do the same from next Tues­day.</p>
    <p>An­nounc­ing the mea­sures yes­ter­day, act­ing Seoul mayor Seo Jeong-hyup said the South Korean cap­i­tal is “cur­rently fac­ing a des­per­ately dan­ger­ous cri­sis”.</p>
    <p>“We have no room left to re­treat,” he said dur­ing an on­line me­dia brief­ing. “We are stop­ping Seoul af­ter 9pm.”</p>
    <p>South Korea recorded 629 new cases yes­ter­day – the high­est in nine months, when the first wave of in­fec­tions hit the south-east­ern city of Daegu.</p>
    <p>The to­tal num­ber of Covid-19 cases has risen to 36,332, with 536 deaths.</p>
    <p>A record-high 295 in­fec­tions hit Seoul, rais­ing the tally to 9,716. Clus­ters have been found at var­i­ous places, such as a clinic, call cen­tre, gym and univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Mr Seo said it has been chal­leng­ing for the city’s au­thor­i­ties to “keep up with the pace of in­fec­tions be­cause clus­ters are emerg­ing si­mul­ta­ne­ously in var­i­ous parts of daily life”.</p>
    <p>Only 15.8 per cent of cases re­ported in the past two weeks had known trans­mis­sion routes – un­like the pre­vi­ous two waves that could be traced largely to mas­sive church gath­er­ings and ral­lies.</p>
    <p>It does not help that the win­ter cold is also keep­ing peo­ple in­doors – in close prox­im­ity and in dense spa­ces, Mr Seo added.</p>
    <p>Seoul and greater Seoul have been placed un­der the third of a five-tier so­cial dis­tanc­ing sys­tem since Nov 24.</p>
    <p>The anti-virus mea­sures en­forced in­clude clo­sures of clubs and bars, a ban on dine-in ser­vices at cafes, and a 20 per cent cap on seat­ing at re­li­gious events.</p>
    <p>Karaoke rooms and in­door sports fa­cil­i­ties have also been closed from 9pm, while restau­rants have switched to de­liv­ery and take­out.</p>
    <p>But these re­stric­tions have yet to show any ef­fect, as the num­ber of new cases has been hov­er­ing at around 400 to 600 a day.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to curbs on nightlife beyond 9pm, Seoul will also shut down all pub­lic fa­cil­i­ties run by the city from to­day. These in­clude 66 cul­tural spa­ces, 114 for youth, and 1,114 for sports.</p>
    <p>With these new strin­gent curbs, Seoul city hopes to bring the num­ber of in­fec­tions down to fewer than 100 cases a day within two weeks.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts have warned that the daily tally could rise to 700 to 1,000 within the next two weeks if the pace of in­fec­tions does not sub­side.</p>
    <p>The health au­thor­i­ties are also urg­ing the 490,000 high school se­niors who just sat their college en­trance ex­ams on Thurs­day to re­frain from go­ing out in big num­bers to cel­e­brate.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Chung Sye-kyun yes­ter­day said the gov­ern­ment will mon­i­tor the sit­u­a­tion and de­cide whether to im­pose more curbs to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Mr Seo, mean­while, warned that all eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties will stop should the coun­try im­pose the fifth tier of so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>“That is the last card we will use,” he said.</p>
