    <p>Hopes have risen in In­done­sia that cor­rup­tion is once again be­ing tar­geted in the light of re­cent high-pro­file busts, but many an­a­lysts re­main scep­ti­cal.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber last year, vi­o­lent protests erupted across the coun­try af­ter what many be­lieved to be an ef­fort to crip­ple the highly re­spected Cor­rup­tion Erad­i­ca­tion Com­mis­sion, bet­ter known by its lo­cal acro­nym KPK, which, up till then, had done a stel­lar job in putting of­fend­ers be­hind bars.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment re­vised the law which, among other things, made it manda­tory for the anti-graft body to ob­tain ap­proval from an over­sight body known as the KPK Su­per­vi­sory Board, ap­pointed by the pres­i­dent. The KPK had to get the green light for ar­rests, as­set seizures as well as wire­taps on po­ten­tial sus­pects. Pre­vi­ously, in­ves­ti­ga­tors needed only the ap­proval from the five top of­fi­cials of the KPK .</p>
    <p>All KPK staff were also made part of the civil ser­vice, ul­ti­mately erod­ing the in­de­pen­dence of the body which was es­tab­lished in 2003 by for­mer pres­i­dent Me­gawati Soekarnop­u­tri in the wake of eupho­ria for re­form fol­low­ing the fall of strong­man Suharto in 1998.</p>
    <p>Led by for­mer po­lice gen­eral Firli Bahuri, who was ap­pointed last De­cem­ber, the KPK has recorded only seven suc­cess­ful sting op­er­a­tions this year. Last year, it had 20.</p>
    <p>Mr Firli him­self has courted con­tro­versy for fly­ing a pri­vate he­li­copter on a per­sonal trip, which the KPK su­per­vi­sory board ruled in Septem­ber as an eth­i­cal vi­o­la­tion since it dis­played a “he­donis­tic life­style”. Prior to tak­ing charge of the KPK, he was also en­tan­gled in other al­le­ga­tions in­clud­ing for re­ceiv­ing free con­cert tick­ets.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic trust in KPK waned af­ter its wings were clipped. But the re­cent ar­rests of se­nior of­fi­cials, in­clud­ing two Cabi­net min­is­ters, have re­vived hopes about the fu­ture for the agency.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Arbi Sanit told The Straits Times the ar­rests were due to the hard work of KPK in­ves­ti­ga­tors as well as an in­ter­nal turf bat­tle be­tween Mr Firli and prom­i­nent KPK in­ves­ti­ga­tor Novel Baswedan, who be­came par­tially blind in 2017 af­ter an acid at­tack while he was head­ing a probe into sev­eral ma­jor cases, in­clud­ing the roll-out of new ID cards which im­pli­cated law­mak­ers and high-rank­ing of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Mr Novel was key in the Nov 25 ar­rest of Mar­itime Af­fairs and Fish­eries Min­is­ter Edhy Prabowo, said the po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist. Mr Edhy has been ac­cused of ac­cept­ing 3.4 bil­lion ru­piah (S$320,000) in bribes in ex­change for grant­ing a lob­ster lar­vae ex­port per­mit.</p>
    <p>Mr Arbi at­trib­uted Sun­day’s ar­rest of So­cial Af­fairs Min­is­ter Ju­liari Batubara over al­leged bribery in the sup­ply of Covid-19 aid packages to Mr Firli.</p>
    <p>“Both Novel and Firli were from the po­lice force, and are now ri­vals at the KPK. With the ar­rests of two min­is­ters, now the score is 1 is to 1. If the ri­valry con­tin­ues, we could see more cases be­ing un­earthed, which will be good for In­done­sia,” said Mr Arbi.</p>
    <p>Other an­a­lysts cau­tioned that the re­cent ar­rests may not be a sign that the KPK is get­ting stronger.</p>
    <p>Nab­bing cor­rupt sus­pects is one thing, solv­ing pend­ing cases is an­other, said Pro­fes­sor Zainal Arifin Mochtar, di­rec­tor of Gad­jah Mada Univer­sity’s Cen­tre for Anti-cor­rup­tion Stud­ies.</p>
    <p>He said: “We can’t form judg­ments based on a few ar­rests. Erad­i­cat­ing cor­rup­tion is not merely un­earthing a case, but also sub­ject­ing those in­volved to a le­gal process and en­sur­ing no re­peat of cases.</p>
    <p>“KPK is still at the first stage. The re­cent cases show only KPK is not dead yet, that it still has a pulse, still beep­ing. But it prob­a­bly can’t sprint or run a marathon.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ad­nan Topan Hu­sodo, co­or­di­na­tor of the In­done­sian Cor­rup­tion Watch, noted that the agency had yet to nab Mr Harun Masiku, a politi­cian from Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo’s In­done­sian Demo­cratic Party of Strug­gle, who is a bribery sus­pect. He has been on the run since Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>“Was the KPK cherry-pick­ing on who to pur­sue?” Mr Ad­nan said.</p>
    <p>“There’s noth­ing ad­vanced in the modus operandi of the re­cent cases such as links to over­seas trans­ac­tions or in­volve­ment of many play­ers. The cases were quickly un­rav­elled and linked to min­is­ters. The sus­pects’ reck­less­ness in cov­er­ing their tracks show that they did not think that they would be caught by the KPK,” he added.</p>
    <p>Many in In­done­sia be­lieve cor­rup­tion is en­demic and par­tic­u­larly ram­pant among the po­lit­i­cal elites.</p>
    <p>Prof Zainal said the re­cent ar­rests served as a warn­ing to Mr Joko against ap­point­ing self-serv­ing politi­cians into gov­ern­ment. While it may be hard to stave off po­lit­i­cal par­ties who “force their way” to rule the land, it is his duty “to look af­ter the in­tegrity of the gov­ern­ment and the peo­ple’s trust in it”.</p>
    <p>Mr Arbi said the pub­lic would log­i­cally ex­pect Mr Joko to re­place “prob­lem­atic” min­is­ters in a Cabi­net reshuf­fle, but the re­al­ity is that he needs the sup­port of all po­lit­i­cal par­ties in the rul­ing coalition. “Call­ing for a Cabi­net reshuf­fle will only open the door for the dif­fer­ent par­ties to fight for po­si­tions, and Jokowi does not want to take that risk,” said Mr Arbi, us­ing the Pres­i­dent’s nick­name.</p>
    <p>Mr Joko, in a Face­book post on Sun­day, said his gov­ern­ment sup­ported the work of the anti-graft body as “trans­par­ent, open and pro­fes­sional”.</p>
    <p>“I re­spect the on­go­ing le­gal process. I will not pro­tect any­one who is in­volved in cor­rup­tion,” he wrote.</p>
