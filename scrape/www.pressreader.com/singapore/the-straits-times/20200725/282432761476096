    <p>• No mat­ter what hap­pens to­mor­row on the fi­nal day of the Premier League cam­paign, Le­ices­ter man­ager Brendan Rodgers has a mes­sage for his play­ers – that they have done well and it has been a “re­ally good sea­son”.</p>
    <p>The Foxes en­tered the near three-month shut­down caused by the Covid-19 pan­demic l ook­ing odds-on for a top-four fin­ish, but have fal­tered in the fre­netic weeks since last month’s restart, with only two wins in their eight games.</p>
    <p>But Rodgers’ fifth-placed side have been of­fered one last chance to seal a Cham­pi­ons League qual­i­fi­ca­tion berth as they fin­ish at home to third-placed Manchester United, who are a point ahead on 63 points.</p>
    <p>The Red Devils need only a point from this match to qual­ify for Europe’s elite club com­pe­ti­tion, while Le­ices­ter need to win.</p>
    <p>“We want to be in it (the Cham­pi­ons League), but if we fall short, it’s still been a re­ally good sea­son,” Rodgers in­sisted.</p>
    <p>“The re­al­ity and the ex­pectancy (of our play­ers) was not too far away from each other. The ex­pectancy has grown and that was be­cause of the per­for­mance of the team.</p>
    <p>“We are play­ing one of the su­per­pow­ers of world foot­ball with a chance to go above them and get into the Cham­pi­ons League. We have one last shot, and that tells you how well the play­ers have done.”</p>
    <p>The 47-year-old added that in­juries had taken a toll on his play­ers, who are not used to com­pet­ing at the high­est level.</p>
    <p>He is with­out the sus­pended Caglar Soyuncu and the team are miss­ing a num­ber of in­jured play­ers in Ben Chilwell, Ri­cardo Pereira, Chris­tian Fuchs, Daniel Amartey and James Mad­di­son.</p>
    <p>“From Jan­uary to Fe­bru­ary, the con­sis­tency hasn’t been there. It’s the in­ex­pe­ri­ence of the play­ers of be­ing at that level,” Rodgers said.</p>
    <p>“But they couldn’t have given any more. We’ve been re­ally un­for­tu­nate at this cru­cial time that we’ve lost some of the best play­ers in the league.</p>
    <p>“And it shows how good the play­ers have been that we’re still fight­ing for the ul­ti­mate prize.”</p>
    <p>In­cred­i­bly, af­ter 25 games of the sea­son, Le­ices­ter were 14 points clear of Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer’s side and eight clear of Chelsea, who are cur­rently in fourth po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a 3-0 loss at Tot­ten­ham last week­end, Rodgers promised the United show­down, which has ef­fec­tively be­come a Cham­pi­ons League play-off, would be an “all-in” en­counter.</p>
    <p>United have more wrig­gle room but Sol­sk­jaer has also promised they will go for vic­tory.</p>
    <p>“It’s like a fi­nal,” he said. “If we had the chance to go and win there (to get into the top four) we’d be de­lighted.</p>
    <p>“We’ve caught up and given our­selves a fan­tas­tic op­por­tu­nity. But they are very dan­ger­ous.”</p>
    <p>Luke Shaw and Eric Bailly have joined fel­low de­fend­ers Axel Tuanzebe and Phil Jones on the side­lines and are doubt­ful for to­mor­row.</p>
