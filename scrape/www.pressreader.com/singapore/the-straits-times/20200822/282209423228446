    <p>Some time ago, I ex­changed some cor­re­spon­dence with the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) re­gard­ing jointly em­ploy­ing do­mes­tic helpers.</p>
    <p>Es­sen­tially, two house­holds would use the ser­vices of a do­mes­tic helper. The costs – salary, the maid levy, and so on – would be borne by the two house­holds. Of course, the maid would have to agree to the ar­range­ment.</p>
    <p>I was dis­ap­pointed the MOM said it was not al­lowed. No rea­sons were given for it.</p>
    <p>A case may be made to al­low this kind of ar­range­ment now, given the fact that many peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore have lost their jobs or had their in­comes slashed.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, travel re­stric­tions and the clos­ing of bor­ders by coun­tries have made it dif­fi­cult to bring in new maids to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Many fam­i­lies may not be get­ting the nec­es­sary help they need at this time, and I ap­peal to the MOM to re­con­sider this re­stric­tion.</p>
    <p>Al­low­ing it would be a great help to many fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>Also, it would lighten the fi­nan­cial bur­den for those who have no choice but to en­gage a maid even though they are fi­nan­cially stretched.</p>
    <p>The min­istry could lay down some rules and reg­u­la­tions that hir­ers have to ad­here to.</p>
    <p>I hope the MOM can relook this.</p>
