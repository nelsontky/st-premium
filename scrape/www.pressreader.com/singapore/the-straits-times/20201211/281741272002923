    <p>South Korea is con­vert­ing ship­ping con­tain­ers into temporary hos­pi­tal wards and speed­ing up test­ing in or­der to fight an un­abat­ing third wave of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>As the to­tal num­ber of cases surged be­yond 40,000, over 500 con­firmed pa­tients are wait­ing at home due to a short­age of hos­pi­tal beds in Seoul and greater Seoul.</p>
    <p>The coun­try re­ported 682 new cases yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing 646 lo­cal in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>To ease the stress on the med­i­cal sys­tem, the Seoul city gov­ern­ment de­cided to in­stall 48 “con­tainer wards” at Seoul Med­i­cal Cen­tre by yes­ter­day and dis­patch another 102 to pro­vin­cial hos­pi­tals in the days ahead.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that pa­tients may face cer­tain in­con­ve­nience if they are ad­mit­ted to these makeshift wards, the au­thor­i­ties sought pub­lic un­der­stand­ing of the de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>“But it is an un­avoid­able emer­gency sit­u­a­tion,” one of­fi­cial said, adding that the city gov­ern­ment will en­hance safety by in­stalling sur­veil­lance cam­eras and re­strict­ing ac­cess by out­siders.</p>
    <p>Erupt­ing in win­ter, the third wave of in­fec­tions is prov­ing the tough­est to curb as there are too many clus­ters pop­ping up in dif­fer­ent places – from nurs­ing homes and restau­rants to saunas and army units. This makes it hard for con­tact trac­ing to catch up.</p>
    <p>The grow­ing num­ber of young, asymp­to­matic pa­tients, as well as pa­tients with un­known in­fec­tion routes, is also wor­ry­ing. One in five pa­tients is un­linked.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Chung Sye-kyun yes­ter­day in­structed health of­fi­cials to en­hance trac­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties and di­ver­sify test­ing meth­ods.</p>
    <p>In a meet­ing with a Covid-19 re­sponse team, he also ap­pealed to pri­vate hos­pi­tals to “proac­tively co­op­er­ate” with the gov­ern­ment to fight the virus, not­ing that pub­lic fa­cil­i­ties are reach­ing their limit in treat­ing crit­i­cally ill pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Data showed that more than 80 per cent of hos­pi­tal beds for in­fec­tious dis­eases are oc­cu­pied and there were only three avail­able beds left to treat se­ri­ous cases in Seoul as at yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in on Mon­day or­dered the gov­ern­ment to dis­patch “every avail­able per­son­nel” to sup­port epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions, ex­tend test­ing ca­pa­bil­ity and push for the use of anti­gen rapid tests that can pro­duce re­sults in 15 min­utes, much shorter than the six hours re­quired for the usual poly­merase chain re­ac­tion tests.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials have wasted no time in ex­tend­ing op­er­a­tion hours of pub­lic health cen­tres that con­duct virus test­ing and in­tro­duc­ing anti­gen rapid tests at vul­ner­a­ble fa­cil­i­ties, such as nurs­ing homes and elder­care hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>The army has also said it will dis­patch 362 of­fi­cers from its spe­cial war­fare com­mand to pub­lic health cen­tres in the cap­i­tal area from to­day, to as­sist in epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Start­ing next Mon­day, temporary test­ing sites will be set up at more than 150 places where young peo­ple gather in a bid to curb the spread among those in their 20s.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have also started al­low­ing free test­ing and anony­mous test­ing, in a bid to en­cour­age more peo­ple to get tested whether or not they dis­play symp­toms or have come into con­tact with any con­firmed pa­tients.</p>
    <p>These pre-emp­tive ef­forts will help de­tect more asymp­to­matic cases, said the Korea Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion Agency.</p>
    <p>It added that it can con­duct up to 110,000 tests a day.</p>
    <p>More than 24,700 tests were con­ducted on Wed­nes­day alone.</p>
    <p>About 72,700 peo­ple are wait­ing for test re­sults. Eight more deaths were re­ported yes­ter­day, rais­ing the to­tal to 564.</p>
