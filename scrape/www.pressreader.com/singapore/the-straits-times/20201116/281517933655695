    <p>Euro­pean na­tions are tight­en­ing re­stric­tions as their sec­ond wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions in­ten­si­fies.</p>
    <p>Greece will close kinder­gartens and pri­mary schools, and Ger­mans have been told to brace them­selves for four to five more months of se­vere so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>In the United States, Covid-19 fig­ures are shat­ter­ing record after record. In South Korea, the daily caseload topped 200 for a sec­ond straight day yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>ATHENS • Greece on Satur­day an­nounced the clo­sure of pri­mary schools, kinder­gartens and day­care cen­tres as coro­n­avirus deaths crossed a thou­sand.</p>
    <p>Po­lice yes­ter­day also banned pub­lic gath­er­ings of four or more peo­ple ahead of the an­nual an­niver­sary of a 1973 anti-junta up­ris­ing.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties re­ported 2,835 new coro­n­avirus cases on Satur­day, tak­ing the to­tal to 72,510, and 38 new deaths, rais­ing the toll to 1,035.</p>
    <p>Since late Oc­to­ber, the daily num­ber of deaths in the coun­try of nearly 11 mil­lion has quadru­pled while the num­ber of in­fec­tions has dou­bled to around 3,000.</p>
    <p>The most hard-hit area is Thes­sa­loniki in the north.</p>
    <p>Pri­mary schools would be closed un­til the end of this month. Sec­ondary school l es­sons have al­ready been tak­ing place re­motely since last Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“Clos­ing ele­men­tary schools was the last thing we wanted to do. This is a mea­sure of how se­ri­ous the sit­u­a­tion is,” Health Min­is­ter Vas­silis Kik­il­ias said.</p>
    <p>Greece’s na­tion­wide lock­down will last un­til at least Nov 30. A 9pm-5am cur­few is also in place.</p>
    <p>In France, po­lice stepped up con­trols in Paris over the week­end to en­sure res­i­dents were com­ply­ing with lock­down rules amid signs that some were breach­ing them.</p>
    <p>Po­lice broke up an il­le­gal party host­ing up to 400 peo­ple at Joinville-Le-Pont near Paris.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties con­firmed 32,095 Covid-19 in­fec­tions on Satur­day, push­ing the to­tal count to nearly two mil­lion. New deaths rose by 354, tak­ing the toll past 44,000.</p>
    <p>De­spite some gains in the epi­demic sit­u­a­tion as a re­sult of the coun­try’s lock­down and night­time cur­few, French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron warned that “the com­ing days will be de­ci­sive”.</p>
    <p>“Our fight against the epi­demic is col­lec­tive... In class, of­fice, at home, five life-sav­ing ges­tures: Wear a mask, wash your hands reg­u­larly, keep a dis­tance of at least 1m apart, reg­u­larly ven­ti­late closed spa­ces and down­load the TousAn­tiCovid app,” he tweeted on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>In Ger­many, peo­ple were told to brace them­selves for an­other four to five months of se­vere mea­sures to halt the spread of the virus and not to ex­pect a quick eas­ing of rules.</p>
    <p>“We’re not out of the woods yet,” Econ­omy Min­is­ter Peter Alt­maier told weekly Bild am Son­ntag. “We can­not af­ford a yo-yo shut­down with the econ­omy con­stantly open­ing and clos­ing.”</p>
    <p>Ger­many has im­posed a set of mea­sures dubbed a “lock­down light”. While restau­rants are closed, schools and shops so far re­main open.</p>
    <p>Data from the Robert Koch In­sti­tute for in­fec­tious dis­eases yes­ter­day showed that the num­ber of con­firmed cases rose by 16,947 to 790,503. Week­end fig­ures tend to be lower as not all data is re­ported by lo­cal au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Alt­maier said Ger­many should be wary of re­lax­ing re­stric­tions too quickly.</p>
    <p>“If we don’t want days with 50,000 new in­fec­tions, as was the case in France a few weeks ago, we must see through this and not con­stantly spec­u­late about which mea­sures can be re­laxed again,” he said. “All coun­tries that lifted their re­stric­tions too early have so far paid a high price in terms of hu­man lives lost.”</p>
    <p>The Ger­man chair­man of the World Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion, Mr Frank Ul­rich Mont­gomery, warned: “My fore­cast is that we will have to talk about fur­ther re­stric­tions rather than any eas­ing.”</p>
    <p>Ger­man po­lice fired wa­ter can­non dur­ing an anti-lock­down rally in Frank­furt on Satur­day and even­tu­ally broke up the gath­er­ing as so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules were not ob­served.</p>
