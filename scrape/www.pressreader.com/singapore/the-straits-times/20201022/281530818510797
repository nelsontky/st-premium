    <p>French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron was set to at­tend an of­fi­cial me­mo­rial with the fam­ily of a his­tory teacher – who was be­headed for show­ing car­toons of Prophet Muham­mad in class – and about 400 guests at the Sor­bonne Uni­ver­sity in Paris yes­ter­day evening, to posthu­mously award the teacher France’s high­est or­der of merit, the Le­gion d’Hon­neur.</p>
    <p>PARIS • France was set to pay trib­ute yes­ter­day to a his­tory teacher be­headed for show­ing car­toons of Prophet Muham­mad in a free speech les­son, a grue­some at­tack that has shocked the coun­try and prompted a gov­ern­ment crack­down on rad­i­cal Is­lam.</p>
    <p>Seven peo­ple, in­clud­ing two stu­dents, were due to ap­pear be­fore an anti-ter­ror judge for a de­ci­sion on crim­i­nal charges over the killing of 47-year-old his­tory teacher Sa­muel Paty last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>France’s anti-ter­ror prose­cu­tor said yes­ter­day that the two stu­dents had pointed out the teacher to his killer in re­turn for €300 to €350( S $482 to $562).</p>
    <p>The killer, 18-year-old Ab­dul­lakh An­zorov, gave part of the sum to a stu­dent out­side the school, ask­ing him to iden­tify the teacher, prose­cu­tor Jean-Fran­cois Ri­card told a news brief­ing. Others joined them, and An­zorov of­fered to share the rest of the money, Mr Ri­card said.</p>
    <p>In re­turn, he re­ceived a de­scrip­tion of Mr Paty from two of the stu­dents who stayed with him for more than two hours wait­ing for the teacher to ap­pear. Other stu­dents walked away. The killer told the teenagers he was plan­ning to “hu­mil­i­ate and strike” the teacher, and force him to apol­o­gise for show­ing the car­toons.</p>
    <p>The two stu­dents who al­legedly helped the killer, aged 14 and 15, will be pros­e­cuted, Mr Ri­card said.</p>
    <p>Po­lice have car­ried out dozens of raids since the killing, while the gov­ern­ment has or­dered the six­month clo­sure of a mosque out­side Paris. It also plans to dis­solve a group that it said sup­ported Pales­tinian mil­i­tant group Ha­mas.</p>
    <p>“Our fel­low cit­i­zens ex­pect ac­tions,” Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Paty was at­tacked shortly af­ter leav­ing the ju­nior high school</p>
    <p>where he taught in the sub­urb of Con­flans-Sainte-Honorine out­side Paris. He had been the sub­ject of an on­line hate cam­paign af­ter he showed stu­dents car­toons of the Prophet in a civics class – the same im­ages that sparked a bloody as­sault on the of­fices of satir­i­cal magazine Char­lie Hebdo five years ago.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron was to at­tend an of­fi­cial me­mo­rial with Mr Paty’s fam­ily and some 400 guests at Sor­bonne Uni­ver­sity in Paris yes­ter­day evening, where he was set to posthu­mously award the teacher France’s high­est or­der of merit, the Le­gion d’Hon­neur.</p>
    <p>Nine of 16 peo­ple held over the mur­der were re­leased from cus­tody late on Tues­day, in­clud­ing four mem­bers of An­zorov’s fam­ily</p>
    <p>and three stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Among those set to ap­pear be­fore a judge was a dis­grun­tled par­ent from Mr Paty’s school, who had fired up anger about the teacher’s les­son through mes­sages on so­cial me­dia, urg­ing “mo­bil­i­sa­tion” against the teacher.</p>
    <p>The par­ent had ex­changed mes­sages with An­zorov via What­sApp in the days lead­ing up to the mur­der. The ma­te­rial he up­loaded was widely shared, in­clud­ing by a mosque in the Paris sub­urb of Pantin, which the gov­ern­ment closed yes­ter­day for six months for spread­ing ma­te­rial likely to pro­voke “ha­tred and vi­o­lence”.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron has also an­nounced that a pro-Ha­mas group called the Sheikh Yassin Col­lec­tive would be</p>
    <p>dis­solved for be­ing “di­rectly im­pli­cated” in the mur­der.</p>
    <p>The group’s founder, Is­lamist rad­i­cal Ab­del­hakim Se­frioui, is among those in cus­tody over the mur­der.</p>
    <p>The French gov­ern­ment has ear­marked another 50-odd other or­gan­i­sa­tions with links to “rad­i­cal Is­lam” for dis­so­lu­tion. Also in cus­tody are three of An­zorov’s friends – one of whom al­legedly drove him and another who al­legedly ac­com­pa­nied him to buy a weapon.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, in a phone call with Rus­sia’s Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin, Mr Macron asked Moscow for stronger co­op­er­a­tion in the fight against ter­ror. Rus­sia has re­jected any as­so­ci­a­tion with the killer.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Dar­manin said yes­ter­day that he had asked the lo</p>
    <p>cal au­thor­i­ties to put mosques in the ci­ties of Bordeaux and Beziers in south-western France un­der po­lice pro­tec­tion fol­low­ing threats or acts of vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>Separately, French re­gional news­pa­per La Nou­velle Republique re­ceived threats on so­cial me­dia af­ter it pub­lished a car­i­ca­ture of Prophet Muham­mad on its front page, one of its jour­nal­ists said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Paty’s killing has prompted an out­pour­ing of emo­tion and sol­i­dar­ity in France, with tens of thou­sands tak­ing part in ral­lies coun­try­wide over the week­end.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands more took part in a silent march in hon­our of the teacher in Con­flans-Sainte-Honorine on Tues­day.</p>
