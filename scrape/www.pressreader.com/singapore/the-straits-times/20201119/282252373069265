    <p>Shares of Sea, South-east Asia’s most valu­able com­pany, fell after re­port­ing third-quar­ter fi­nan­cial re­sults that showed signs of a slow­down in e-com­merce growth.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore-based com­pany owns e-com­merce plat­form Shopee and game de­vel­oper Garena.</p>
    <p>Its rev­enue dou­bled to US$1.2 bil­lion (S$1.6 bil­lion) for the quar­ter and it boosted an­nual fore­casts for two key busi­nesses. But net losses also dou­bled to US$419.9 mil­lion and quar­ter-on­quar­ter growth in e-com­merce gross mer­chan­dise value dropped to 16 per cent, from 29 per cent in the se­cond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Sea shares slid 4.3 per cent in US trad­ing. The stock is still up more than 300 per cent for the year.</p>
    <p>“The re­sults were dis­ap­point­ing,” said Mr Nir­gu­nan Tiruchel­vam, head of con­sumer sec­tor eq­uity re­search at Tel­limer. “This sug­gests that the mar­ket’s grand ex­pec­ta­tions of high growth in the e-com­merce seg­ment are mis­placed.”</p>
    <p>Sea has emerged as a stock mar­ket sen­sa­tion since its ini­tial public of­fer­ing (IPO) in 2017, a wa­ger the money-los­ing com­pany can es­tab­lish it­self as a leader in e-com­merce and gam­ing in South-east Asia. Its shares have surged about 1,400 per cent since the start of last year, push­ing its mar­ket value to more than US$80 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The rally has minted at least three bil­lion­aires at the com­pany. Chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer For­rest Li’s net worth is es­ti­mated at US$9.4 bil­lion, ac­cord­ing to the Bloomberg Bil­lion­aires In­dex.</p>
    <p>While re­port­ing its fi­nan­cial re­sults, Sea said it now fore­casts its dig­i­tal en­ter­tain­ment busi­ness will sur­pass rev­enue of US$3.1 bil­lion, com­pared with an ear­lier es­ti­mate of as much as US$2 bil­lion. Its e-com­merce busi­ness is now ex­pected to ex­ceed US$2.3 bil­lion, up from as much as US$1.8 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue at Garena in­creased 73 per cent to US$569 mil­lion, re­flect­ing the sus­tained pop­u­lar­ity of mo­bile bat­tle royale game Free Fire.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue from Shopee and other ser­vices climbed 113 per cent to US$489.5 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Sea’s to­tal sales and mar­ket­ing ex­penses in the third quar­ter in­creased 87 per cent to US$471 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Start­ing with its earn­ings re­lease for the third quar­ter, Sea is dis­con­tin­u­ing re­port­ing ad­justed rev­enues and mak­ing other changes to its ac­count­ing method­ol­ogy in re­sponse to Se­cu­ri­ties and Ex­change Com­mis­sion in­quiries.</p>
    <p>Since its IPO in New York, Sea had been en­cour­ag­ing in­vestors and an­a­lysts to fo­cus on fi­nan­cial met­rics that are not in com­pli­ance with the gen­er­ally ac­cepted ac­count­ing prin­ci­ples, or GAAP.</p>
    <p>Chief cor­po­rate of­fi­cer Yan­jun Wang said in Au­gust that for Garena, the com­pany will pro­vide an­other op­er­at­ing met­ric of “book­ings”, which is GAAP rev­enue plus changes in de­ferred rev­enue.</p>
    <p>Sea’s dig­i­tal pay­ments and fi­nan­cial ser­vices unit, Sea­Money, gained traf­fic in the third quar­ter as peo­ple spent more time and money on­line.</p>
    <p>Its to­tal pay­ment vol­ume for the quar­ter ex­ceeded US$2.1 bil­lion, from US$1.6 bil­lion dur­ing the June quar­ter.</p>
