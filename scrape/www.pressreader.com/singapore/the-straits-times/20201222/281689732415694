    <p>In the 2020 Gen­eral Elec­tion, the call to deny the rul­ing Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) a “blank cheque” res­onated with the elec­torate, who voted to in­crease the num­ber of op­po­si­tion MPs in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>The phrase came from then Work­ers’ Party can­di­date Ja­mus Lim, who in a tele­vised de­bate with For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan, said: “What we are try­ing to deny the PAP is not a man­date. What we’re try­ing to deny them is a blank cheque.”</p>
    <p>The July 10 polls saw the Work­ers’ Party se­cure 10 of the 21 seats it con­tested, in­clud­ing its sec­ond group rep­re­sen­ta­tion con­stituency in Sengkang. It also re­tained Alju­nied GRC and Hougang, its sin­gle-seat strong­hold.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the coro­n­avirus pan­demic took hold in the early part of this year, lead­er­ship suc­ces­sion was to have been a defin­ing is­sue in the gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The PAP had put in mo­tion the plan to hand over from its third gen­er­a­tion of lead­ers to the fourth gen­er­a­tion wait­ing in the wings, while the WP too was look­ing to com­plete its tran­si­tion from erst­while chief Low Thia Khi­ang to cur­rent leader Pri­tam Singh.</p>
    <p>There was to have been roar­ing ral­lies, walk­a­bouts and other events where aspir­ing politi­cians would get to meet vot­ers up close.</p>
    <p>But by the time Sin­ga­pore­ans went to the polls in July, Covid-19 had trans­formed all as­pects of life in­clud­ing the elec­tion, from cam­paign­ing to the mes­sages that took cen­tre stage.</p>
    <p>With the pan­demic bring­ing on the worst re­ces­sion ever to hit the coun­try since in­de­pen­dence, the PAP fo­cused on the mes­sage of sav­ing lives and jobs, call­ing for a strong man­date to steer the coun­try out of the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The WP, mean­while, said the cri­sis and its un­prece­dented na­ture have made it all the more im­por­tant for Sin­ga­pore to have a cred­i­ble al­ter­na­tive that can pro­vide fair crit­i­cism to sharpen ideas and poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the nine-day cam­paign that was largely held on­line – through on­line ral­lies, talk shows and also po­lit­i­cal broad­casts on TV – other op­po­si­tion par­ties too would cam­paign on the no­tion of deny­ing the PAP a blank cheque.</p>
    <p>Some crit­i­cised the tim­ing of the elec­tion, called on June 23, three weeks af­ter Sin­ga­pore ex­ited the cir­cuit breaker, say­ing that it would put vot­ers at risk. As it would later emerge, there were no Covid-19 cases or clus­ters linked to GE2020.</p>
    <p>Var­i­ous PAP min­is­ters hit back at the idea that the PAP could ever have a blank cheque to do as it wished, stress­ing that the party is ac­count­able to the elec­torate and re­spon­si­ble for the peo­ple’s wel­fare.</p>
    <p>PAP lead­ers such as Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing and Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice In­dra­nee Ra­jah also coun­tered that the Non-Con­stituency MP scheme guar­an­tees a di­ver­sity of views and op­pos­ing voices in Par­lia­ment, re­gard­less of whether op­po­si­tion mem­bers are elected.</p>
    <p>But for­mer PAP MP Tan Cheng Bock, who was lead­ing his newly set-up Progress Sin­ga­pore Party in its elec­toral de­but, de­scribed the NCMP scheme as a ploy to en­tice vot­ers not to vote for the op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>In a poll con­ducted by polling firm Black­box Re­search re­leased af­ter the elec­tion was over, 47 per cent of 742 re­spon­dents agreed with the no­tion that “Sin­ga­pore­ans should not be giv­ing the PAP a blank cheque”. The other 53 per cent agreed that the PAP needed a strong man­date to steer Sin­ga­pore out of the coro­n­avirus cri­sis.</p>
    <p>On July 10, some 2.65 mil­lion peo­ple headed to the un­usual polls, wear­ing masks and tot­ing hand sani­tis­ers. Se­niors had ded­i­cated time bands in which to vote, while oth­ers were given sug­gested time­bands to turn up, in a move meant to pre­vent over­crowd­ing.</p>
    <p>But some con­fu­sion among vot­ers and polling agents alike on the rules re­sulted in long queues form­ing and nerves fray­ing at some polling cen­tres. In the end, vot­ing hours, sched­uled to end by 8pm, were ex­tended to 10pm.</p>
    <p>The PAP won 83 of the 93 seats con­tested, with 61.24 per cent of votes, 8.7 points down from its 69.9 per cent vote share in 2015.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the re­sults were an­nounced, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said the elec­torate had shown a clear de­sire for a di­ver­sity of voices in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>He also said Mr Singh would be des­ig­nated as the of­fi­cial Leader of the Op­po­si­tion, mark­ing an­other first for Sin­ga­pore in an elec­tion for the his­tory books.</p>
    <p>2020 has been a year of up­heaval and cri­sis – one that was shaped by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. It also saw sig­nif­i­cant de­vel­op­ments, such as a gen­eral elec­tion in Sin­ga­pore and the United States elect­ing its next leader. In this 12-day se­ries,</p>
