    <p>Yes­ter­day was the first day of the two-week col­lec­tion pe­riod for the Sin­ga­pore To­gether Pack at com­mu­nity clubs, com­mu­nity cen­tres and res­i­dents’ com­mit­tee cen­tres. This year’s pack comes in a tote bag and in­cludes hand sani­tiser, a ther­mome­ter and face masks.</p>
    <p>Mr Zou Ji He, a hawker who will be work­ing on the pub­lic hol­i­day on Aug 9, was pleased to re­ceive his fam­ily’s Na­tional Day Pa­rade (NDP) pack yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It is the first NDP pack the per­ma­nent res­i­dent (PR) has man­aged to get his hands on since he moved here from China more than seven years ago.</p>
    <p>He was at Keat Hong Com­mu­nity Club in Choa Chu Kang to col­lect it with his seven-year-old daugh­ter, his only child.</p>
    <p>“She was born here and con­sid­ers her­self Sin­ga­porean. She par­tic­u­larly likes the flag and, I am sure, will be wav­ing it. I think it is a great pol­icy that the Gov­ern­ment has in­cluded PR house­holds in the scheme,” said the 42-year-old.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day was the first day of the two-week col­lec­tion pe­riod for the Sin­ga­pore To­gether Pack at com­mu­nity clubs or com­mu­nity cen­tres (CCs) and res­i­dents’ com­mit­tee (RC) cen­tres.</p>
    <p>This year’s pack comes in a tote bag, and – fol­low­ing sug­ges­tions that it should con­tain es­sen­tials more rel­e­vant to fam­i­lies amid a pan­demic – in­cludes hand sani­tiser, a ther­mome­ter and face masks.</p>
    <p>Every Sin­ga­porean and PR house­hold is el­i­gi­ble to col­lect the bag this year. Each house­hold can col­lect one pack, and res­i­dents must pre­sent their NRIC at the col­lec­tion coun­ters for ver­i­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple The Straits Times spoke to said this makes the pack much more ac­ces­si­ble than in pre­vi­ous years, when NDP packs were given out only to those at­tend­ing the pa­rade or pa­rade re­hearsals, and those sup­port­ing the or­gan­i­sa­tion of the event.</p>
    <p>Ms Es­ther Koh, who is cur­rently un­em­ployed but used to work for a petroleum com­pany, said a bag for each fam­ily is the “per­fect” way to go about dis­tribut­ing the packs.</p>
    <p>“It is usu­ally quite un­fair, be­cause only se­lected peo­ple get it and it’s so dif­fi­cult to bid for tick­ets. Now, I can get the bags with­out hav­ing to sit un­der the hot sun for the pa­rade,” the 62-year-old said. “If peo­ple do not want it, they can choose not to col­lect it. I think it’s a very nice ges­ture by the Gov­ern­ment.”</p>
    <p>There had been calls in some quar­ters in the lead-up to NDP this year to al­low peo­ple to opt out of re­ceiv­ing the pack, with a pe­ti­tion cit­ing rea­sons rang­ing from the cur­rent eco­nomic con­di­tions to other pos­si­ble uses of the re­sources.</p>
    <p>Mr Richard Ho, a man­ager at a med­i­cal com­pany, said the con­tents of the bag could be stream­lined fur­ther, as he ri­fled through the pack mo­ments af­ter col­lect­ing it at Keat Hong CC.</p>
    <p>“I un­der­stand the need for com­mem­o­ra­tive items, but things like the bag of chips are quite for­get­table and not re­ally nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>“But this year’s bag is al­ready bet­ter than pre­vi­ous years be­cause it has fewer toys and more us­able items, like face masks,” the 52-year-old added.</p>
    <p>Third-year polytech­nic stu­dent Arthur Lee said it is good that the Gov­ern­ment is giv­ing out the packs, as they pro­vide res­i­dents with a sense of nor­mal­ity dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Al­though the 19-year-old is likely to have to study for his ex­am­i­na­tions dur­ing the NDP, he col­lected the pack on his fam­ily’s be­half.</p>
    <p>“I think it is not a bad tra­di­tion, but we should keep talk­ing about what we need or do not need in the bags.</p>
    <p>“That they are giv­ing the bags out to every fam­ily this year can be seen also as a show of sup­port for ev­ery­one and will raise spir­its.”</p>
