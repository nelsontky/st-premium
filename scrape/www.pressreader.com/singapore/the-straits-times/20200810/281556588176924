    <p>In the film Pro­ject Power, which de­buts on Net­flix on Friday, Jamie Foxx (be­low) and Joseph Gor­don-Le­vitt play a former sol­dier and po­lice of­fi­cer who team up to find those re­spon­si­ble for a street drug that has sparked a crime wave in New Or­leans. The drug gives you su­per­pow­ers for five min­utes but there is a catch: You can­not choose what th­ese pow­ers are and they might also kill you.</p>
    <p>Would you take a street drug that gives you su­per­pow­ers for five min­utes – but you can­not choose what those pow­ers are and they might also kill you?</p>
    <p>In the film Pro­ject Power, which de­buts on Net­flix on Friday, Jamie Foxx and Joseph Gor­don-Le­vitt play a former sol­dier and po­lice of­fi­cer who team up to find those re­spon­si­ble for the ques­tion­able drug, which has sparked a crime wave in New Or­leans.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times and other press by video chat from Los An­ge­les re­cently, the ac­tors say that while the movie is an ac­tion­packed thriller, the pills can be in­ter­preted as a metaphor.</p>
    <p>Gor­don-Le­vitt, who ap­peared in the sci­ence-fiction block­busters In­cep­tion (2010) and Looper (2012), says: “The thing about the pill in the movie is you don’t know what you’re go­ing to get. It’s dif­fer­ent for ev­ery­body, and it could be good and it could be bad.</p>
    <p>“I see it as a metaphor for re­ally pow­er­ful tech­nol­ogy. Tech­nol­ogy al­ways has the pos­si­bil­ity to harm or to help and I re­ally think it’s up to hu­man be­ings to de­cide how tech­nol­ogy gets used.”</p>
    <p>“We’re cer­tainly ex­pe­ri­enc­ing that more than ever and we’re go­ing to ex­pe­ri­ence it more as tech­nol­ogy gets more pow­er­ful,” adds the 39-year-old, whose po­lice­man char­ac­ter takes the drug so he can fight crim­i­nals who pop those pills.</p>
    <p>For Foxx, who won an Oscar for the 2004 mu­si­cal biopic Ray, the movie is get­ting at a larger point about the choices power presents.</p>
    <p>“A power pill, or pure power, can be dan­ger­ous, es­pe­cially in the hands of the wrong peo­ple,” says the 52-year-old.</p>
    <p>“Any­body can have that power, but it’s how you use it. Do you want to put love into the world or do you want to pump hate and con­fu­sion into it?”</p>
    <p>The im­por­tance of that choice is es­pe­cially ob­vi­ous when so­ci­ety is in cri­sis, he adds.</p>
    <p>“We made this movie two years ago and weren’t try­ing to fore­shadow any­thing, but if you look at where we are now and the peo­ple at the top of the chain: What are they go­ing to use their power for? Are they go­ing to help hu­man­ity or use it to break hu­man­ity in half?”</p>
    <p>As for what he does when he wields in­flu­ence him­self, Foxx – who played a su­pervil­lain in The Amaz­ing Spi­der-Man 2 (2014) – says with a smile: “When I’ve been given the power, I want to spread love all around the world.”</p>
    <p>Gor­don-Le­vitt chooses to use his own in­flu­ence to try and have an im­pact on peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“That could be in small ways with the peo­ple in my life or some­times in more far-reach­ing ways like with art, movies and sto­ries, which I think can be pow­er­ful.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know how much it does or it doesn’t, but I try as much as I can to do work that is pow­er­ful and does make some kind of im­pact on peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Asked if he would take a su­per­power pill for real and what abil­i­ties he would want it to give him, Foxx breaks out into song – an im­pro­vised an­them for his fic­tional al­ter ego “Love Man”.</p>
    <p>“I’m go­ing to give all the love to the world lead­ers be­cause I don’t think they’ve felt love in a while or what it is to be counted on for clar­ity. So I’m go­ing to give a huge dose of love to them,” he says.</p>
    <p>Gor­don-Le­vitt’s de­sired power is sim­i­larly al­tru­is­tic.</p>
    <p>“I’m in a for­tu­nate po­si­tion where I don’t have to risk my life (to take such a pill), so I wouldn’t take it at all.</p>
    <p>“But if I could choose a su­per­power, I choose em­pa­thy: the abil­ity to see through some­one else’s eyes, hear through some­one else’s ears or touch, taste and smell what other peo­ple sense,” he adds.</p>
    <p>“This is what we al­ways try to do as ac­tors – put our­selves in some­one else’s shoes when we play a char­ac­ter dif­fer­ent from our­selves.</p>
    <p>“But if you could take it to the next level and have it as a su­per­power, that would be in­cred­i­bly il­lu­mi­nat­ing.”</p>
    <p>• Pro­ject Power de­buts on Net­flix on Friday.</p>
