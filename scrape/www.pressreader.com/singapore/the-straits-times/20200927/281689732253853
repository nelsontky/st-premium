    <p>Mustafa Cen­tre, Ras­a­pura Masters at The Shoppes at Ma­rina Bay Sands and ve­hi­cle in­spec­tion cen­tre STAI Jalan Boon Lay are among places re­cently vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were in­fec­tious, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It added that there were 20 new cases of the coro­n­avirus in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes can be found on MOH’s web­site.</p>
    <p>Those who were at th­ese places at the same time are ad­vised to mon­i­tor their health for two weeks from their date of visit.</p>
    <p>There is one com­mu­nity case among the new cases. He is a work per­mit holder from In­dia and the case is cur­rently un­linked.</p>
    <p>He was de­tected as a re­sult of MOH’s ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers in the con­struc­tion, marine and process sec­tors who are liv­ing out­side the dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>MOH said that he was asymp­to­matic. Epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions of the case are in progress.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, all the iden­ti­fied close con­tacts of the case have been iso­lated and placed on quar­an­tine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quar­an­tine pe­riod. MOH will also con­duct sero­log­i­cal tests for his house­hold con­tacts to de­ter­mine if he could have been in­fected by them.</p>
    <p>Five im­ported Covid-19 cases were also an­nounced. They com­prise one work pass holder, three work per­mit hold­ers and one de­pen­dant’s pass holder. Four of the cases are cur­rently em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore and ar­rived from In­dia and In­done­sia on Sept 14, and Brazil and the Philip­pines on Sept 13. The de­pen­dant’s pass holder ar­rived from In­dia on Sept 15.</p>
    <p>All of them had been placed on 14-day stay-home no­tice (SHN) upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, and were tested while serv­ing their SHN at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 14 new coro­n­avirus pa­tients, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,685.</p>
    <p>Seven had been iden­ti­fied ear­lier as con­tacts of pre­vi­ous cases, and had al­ready been quar­an­tined to pre­vent fur­ther trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>They were tested dur­ing quar­an­tine to de­ter­mine their sta­tus.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing seven cases were de­tected through sur­veil­lance test­ing.</p>
    <p>Of the new cases, 90 per cent are im­ported or linked to known cases or clus­ters, while the rest are pend­ing con­tact trac­ing, MOH said.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one case a day in the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one case a day in the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 19 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,344 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 25 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 274 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
