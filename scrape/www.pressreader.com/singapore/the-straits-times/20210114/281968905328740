        <p>LON­DON • As well as a strain­ing health sys­tem and polic­ing of lock­down rules, Bri­tain’s fi­nan­cial re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic is in the spot­light again as more fam­i­lies risk slip­ping into poverty.</p>
        <p>A drop in wel­fare pay­ments called Uni­ver­sal Credit could see mil­lions of peo­ple lose out on aid from what is al­ready one of the de­vel­oped world’s least gen­er­ous sys­tems. That is af­ter the gov­ern­ment’s free school meals pro­gramme sparked another row this week, as images on so­cial me­dia showed the lim­ited con­tents of pack­ages that Manch­ester United foot­ball star and cam­paigner Mar­cus Rash­ford called “un­ac­cept­able”.</p>
        <p>Bri­tain has spent more than £280 bil­lion (S$508 bil­lion) fight­ing the eco­nomic im­pact of Covid-19, pro­vid­ing sup­port for busi­nesses and fur­loughed work­ers. But Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son is com­ing un­der in­creas­ing crit­i­cism from char­i­ties and po­lit­i­cal op­po­nents for not go­ing far enough, and leav­ing de­ci­sions till the 11th hour.</p>
        <p>Some of the na­tion’s poor­est stand to lose £20 (S$36) a week in Uni­ver­sal Credit in April should an emer­gency in­crease not be ex­tended. While the gov­ern­ment has said it is an is­sue for the March bud­get, the un­cer­tainty is al­ready hav­ing an im­pact on spend­ing as peo­ple worry about pay­ing the bills, ac­cord­ing to the Joseph Rown­tree Foun­da­tion.</p>
        <p>“Twenty pounds a week of in­come is the dif­fer­ence be­tween go­ing to a food bank or go­ing to a su­per­mar­ket,” said Ms Re­becca McDon­ald, se­nior economist at the</p>
        <p>group, which fo­cuses on poverty. “It’s the dif­fer­ence for some fam­i­lies be­tween hav­ing their heat­ing on and their lights on, or not.”</p>
        <p>The is­sue of Uni­ver­sal Credit has be­come all the more im­por­tant be­cause it is the only safety net avail­able for many of the es­ti­mated three mil­lion peo­ple who have found them­selves ex­cluded from other sup­port pack­ages.</p>
        <p>The Joseph Rown­tree Foun­da­tion es­ti­mates that 6.2 mil­lion fam­i­lies would lose in­come if the up­lift is re­moved, pulling 200,000 more chil­dren into poverty. The Le­ga­tum In­sti­tute think-tank reck­ons 690,000 more peo­ple have been pushed into poverty by the pan­demic al­ready, a num­ber that would have been dou­bled with­out the ex­tra money.</p>
        <p>Mr John­son’s press sec­re­tary, Ms Al­le­gra Strat­ton, said on Mon­day that min­is­ters will “take a judg­ment in due course” on whether to ex­tend the ex­tra month. “There’s still some time,” she told re­porters. “We un­der­stand the im­por­tance of this to many fam­i­lies.”</p>
        <p>Chan­cel­lor of the Ex­che­quer Rishi Su­nak said this week the de­ci­sion is “rightly” one for the bud­get.</p>
        <p>The ap­proach is em­blem­atic of Bri­tain’s eco­nomic re­sponse to the pan­demic, which won praise in the early days but has now drawn crit­i­cism for de­scend­ing into fire­fight­ing.</p>
        <p>Last year, the gov­ern­ment’s fur­lough plan was ex­tended on the day it had been due to end, while an evic­tion ban, which had been due to end on Mon­day, was ex­tended only last Fri­day.</p>
        <p>One of the peo­ple ex­cluded from</p>
        <p>the pan­demic sup­port is Ms Es­ter De Roij, a Bris­tol-based wildlife film-maker. She saw three shoots, equat­ing to nearly £20,000 of work, can­celled overnight when last March’s lock­down be­gan.</p>
        <p>Hav­ing set her­self up as a sole trader only in 2019, she was un­able to draw on the aid for the self-em­ployed, and has since re­lied on Uni­ver­sal Credit, sup­ple­mented by help from her fam­ily and tem­po­rary work with the Post Of­fice.</p>
        <p>The ex­tra money might not sound like a lot, but los­ing it would mean she risks not be­ing able to pay her land­lord, she said. “At the mo­ment, I can cover rent and I need to find money from some­where else and pay for food,” said Ms De Roij. “But if that gets taken away, then I can’t af­ford to live where I live. For me, that’s the dif­fer­ence be­tween hav­ing a roof over my head and not.”</p>
        <p>Even with the up­lift, fam­i­lies un­able to find work will on average re­ceive £1,600 less per year in so­cial se­cu­rity sup­port than they would have done in 2011, ac­cord­ing to the Joseph Rown­tree Foun­da­tion.</p>
        <p>Keep­ing the boost will cost an es­ti­mated £9 bil­lion a year, the foun­da­tion es­ti­mates. While that is a frac­tion of the to­tal spend­ing on the cri­sis, ex­tend­ing the pol­icy will ham­per Mr Su­nak’s longer-term goal of re­turn­ing the virus-rav­aged public fi­nances to a more sus­tain­able foot­ing.</p>
        <p>The safety net of Uni­ver­sal Credit will be­come more im­por­tant if pre­dic­tions for a jump in unem­ploy­ment, al­ready at the high­est since 2016, tran­spire later this year.</p>
