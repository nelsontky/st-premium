    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON US Supreme Court nom­i­nee Amy Coney Bar­rett will tell sen­a­tors in her high-stakes con­fir­ma­tion hear­ing this week that she will ap­proach cases based on the law, not her per­sonal views, as Democrats urged her to step aside on an up­com­ing chal­lenge to the Oba­macare law and any po­ten­tial election-re­lated dis­putes.</p>
    <p>The four-day hear­ings be­gan yes­ter­day in the Se­nate ju­di­ciary com­mit­tee, a key step be­fore a fi­nal full Se­nate vote by the end of October on her nom­i­na­tion for a life­time job on the court.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s ses­sion mainly in­volved open­ing state­ments, with some law­mak­ers par­tic­i­pat­ing re­motely be­cause of the coro­n­avirus out­break, which has di­rectly af­fected the com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>Com­mit­tee chair­man Lind­sey Gra­ham said it is the Se­nate’s con­sti­tu­tional duty to con­firm Ms Bar­rett as soon as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Utah Repub­li­can Mike Lee, who re­ceived a pos­i­tive Covid-19 di­ag­no­sis 10 days ago, gave his 10-minute open­ing state­ment with­out a mask. Other law­mak­ers also did not wear masks while speak­ing. North Carolina Sen­a­tor Thom Til­lis, the other com­mit­tee mem­ber who re­cently tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, par­tic­i­pated re­motely.</p>
    <p>“This is go­ing to be a long con­tentious week,” said Mr Gra­ham, adding: “Let’s make it re­spect­ful. Let’s make it chal­leng­ing. Let’s re­mem­ber, the world is watch­ing.”</p>
    <p>Ms Bar­rett, who sat at a ta­ble fac­ing the sen­a­tors, wore a black face mask. Her hus­band and seven chil­dren sat be­hind her, also wear­ing pro­tec­tive masks.</p>
    <p>Ms Bar­rett her­self will make her own open­ing state­ment af­ter the 22 mem­bers of the com­mit­tee are given a chance to speak, and will face ques­tion­ing from sen­a­tors to­day and to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a copy of her pre­pared re­marks re­leased on Sun­day, Ms Bar­rett, 48, will say that as a judge she seeks to “reach the re­sult re­quired by the law, what­ever my own pref­er­ences might be”.</p>
    <p>“When I write an opin­ion re­solv­ing a case, I read ev­ery word from the per­spec­tive of the los­ing party,” she said on her ap­proach to cases. “I ask my­self how would I view the de­ci­sion if one of my chil­dren was the party I was rul­ing against.”</p>
    <p>Ms Bar­rett’s con­fir­ma­tion to re­place the late lib­eral Jus­tice Ruth Bader Gins­burg would cre­ate a 6-3 con­ser­va­tive ma­jor­ity in the court that could lead to rul­ings rolling back abor­tion rights, ex­pand­ing re­li­gious and gun rights, and up­hold­ing Repub­li­can-backed vot­ing re­stric­tions, among other is­sues.</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic op­po­si­tion to her on pol­icy is­sues has fo­cused on her pos­si­ble role in de­cid­ing a case be­fore the Supreme Court in which Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and Repub­li­can-led states are seek­ing to in­val­i­date the Af­ford­able Care Act (ACA) health­care law, of­ten re­ferred to as Oba­macare.</p>
    <p>Sen­a­tor Dianne Fe­in­stein, the se­nior Demo­crat on the com­mit­tee, noted that Ms Bar­rett had crit­i­cised the court’s 2012 rul­ing, au­thored by con­ser­va­tive Chief Jus­tice John Roberts, that up­held the law.</p>
    <p>Ms Bar­rett could be on the court by the time the case is ar­gued on Nov 10. “This well could mean that if Judge Bar­rett is con­firmed, Amer­i­cans stand to lose the ben­e­fits the ACA pro­vides,” Ms Fe­in­stein said.</p>
    <p>Se­nate Demo­cratic leader Chuck Schumer said Ms Bar­rett should re­cuse her­self from any cases in­volv­ing the pres­i­den­tial election be­cause of Mr Trump’s state­ments in which he said the court is likely to hear election cases. Mr Trump, who is run­ning for re-election against Demo­crat Joe Bi­den, has in­di­cated he ex­pects the court to rule in his favour if Ms Bar­rett is con­firmed.</p>
    <p>“She doesn’t come un­bi­ased and that’s why she should re­cuse her­self,” Mr Schumer said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, with Repub­li­cans hold­ing a 53-47 ma­jor­ity in the Se­nate, Ms Bar­rett’s con­fir­ma­tion seems as­sured.</p>
    <p>Ms Bar­rett, a de­vout Catholic, is also ex­pected to face Demo­cratic ques­tion­ing on abor­tion. In 2006, while teach­ing law at the Univer­sity of Notre Dame, she added her name to an ad­ver­tise­ment op­pos­ing “abor­tion on de­mand” and also signed a sim­i­lar state­ment in 2013, she dis­closed last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>In her pre­pared re­marks, Ms Bar­rett, 48, said that as a judge she seeks to “reach the re­sult re­quired by the law, what­ever my own pref­er­ences might be”. “When I write an opin­ion re­solv­ing a case, I read ev­ery word from the per­spec­tive of the los­ing party,” she said on her ap­proach to cases.</p>
    <p>“I ask my­self how would I view the de­ci­sion if one of my chil­dren was the party I was rul­ing against.”</p>
