    <p>Char­maine Soh scor­ing for Sin­ga­pore against Ire­land in a Na­tions Cup match in 2017. The na­tional cap­tain be­lieves that the coaches in her academy can also be good men­tors to young play­ers and teach them about life as well.</p>
    <p>When na­tional cap­tain Char­maine Soh joined net­ball as a co-cur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­ity in Sec­ondary 1, the gen­eral con­sen­sus within her St Hilda’s Sec­ondary School team was that, as a neigh­bour­hood school, it was al­ways go­ing to be an up­hill bat­tle against the more es­tab­lished teams.</p>
    <p>Such at­ti­tude is self-de­feat­ing and Soh, 30, hopes to change this mind­set with the open­ing of her Stel­lar Net­ball Academy.</p>
    <p>She told The Straits Times: “We should be­lieve in our­selves since we’ve worked hard and not let such men­tal blocks crip­ple our per­for­mances dur­ing com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>“As I was grow­ing up, I also no­ticed that play­ers that are very young only go to school for train­ing but they don’t have other sup­port in other ar­eas such as in nutri­tion, strength and con­di­tion­ing as well as in the men­tal as­pect.”</p>
    <p>This was the mo­ti­va­tion be­hind the academy, which started op­er­a­tions on Oct 13. Be­sides Soh, the other co-founders are sport and per­for­mance psy­chol­o­gist Lim Han Ee and for­mer na­tional bas­ket­baller Matthias Koh.</p>
    <p>Regis­tra­tion for the three-day net­ball camps start­ing next month has be­gun and the fees are $304.39 per par­tic­i­pant. Be­sides net­ball tech­niques, the pro­gramme in­cludes ed­u­cat­ing play­ers aged nine to 18 about nutri­tion, sport psy­chol­ogy and strength and con­di­tion­ing.</p>
    <p>To ad­here to safe dis­tanc­ing guide­lines, only five play­ers are al­lowed on court and par­tic­i­pants will be split into two groups for all ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Soh, who has been in the na­tional team since 2011, said: “We got coaches on the ba­sis that they’re not just good coaches who know net­ball very well, but they can also be men­tors to the girls and teach them about life as well.”</p>
    <p>The camps will be led by Soh, Lim and Chin Chih Yung, strength and con­di­tion­ing coach at Net­ball Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The coach­ing team in­clude Wang Jing Qing, who won three Net­ball Su­per League ti­tles as the Blaze Dol­phins coach, and Soh’s na­tional team­mate Kwok Shuyi.</p>
    <p>Lim, 42, said it is im­por­tant to teach young play­ers how to be re­silient and man­age fail­ure so that they can ap­ply these skills in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>He added: “We know there’ll be adversity com­ing their way but we also want them to dis­cover their pas­sion for sport. When they em­brace chal­lenges and take them with a growth mind­set, they don’t burn out.”</p>
    <p>For Wang, she hopes to help play­ers build a good foun­da­tion of net­ball skills, such as ball han­dling, de­ci­sion mak­ing and space aware­ness.</p>
    <p>“The young play­ers are like a blank piece of pa­per so they’re eas­ier to mould and teach the cor­rect stuff be­cause it’s not easy to change habits when you get older,” she noted.</p>
    <p>Soh, who is a se­nior man­age­ment con­sul­tant at Deloitte, also sought the ad­vice of for­mer na­tional cap­tain Micky Lin.</p>
    <p>Lin, 35, who opened her own academy Overathird in 2016 but closed it in Fe­bru­ary af­ter she re­turned to her full-time job as a mar­ket­ing man­ager, said: “I’ve shared with her some tips I learnt from Overathird, mainly lo­gis­ti­cal chal­lenges with re­gard to venue and costs. I had a lot of fun run­ning my academy and I’m ex­cited for her.”</p>
    <p>Soh also hopes the cen­tre can cre­ate a path­way for young girls into net­ball clubs and even­tu­ally the na­tional team.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, recre­ational net­ball pro­grammes for older play­ers are also in the pipe­line.</p>
    <p>Lim said: “Our longer-term vi­sion is to make an im­pact on net­ball stan­dards and the ecosys­tem in Sin­ga­pore. We want to help peo­ple get more from the ex­pe­ri­ence, whether it’s for re­cre­ation or high per­for­mance.”</p>

    <p>They don’t have other sup­port in other ar­eas such as in nutri­tion, strength and con­di­tion­ing as well as in the men­tal as­pect.</p>
