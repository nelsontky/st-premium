    <p>Three pol­icy is­sues largely dom­i­nated this week’s Par­lia­ment de­bate.</p>
    <p>First, for­eign man­power. MPs had sev­eral pro­pos­als: Fur­ther rais­ing the min­i­mum pay for sec­tors like in­fo­comm tech­nol­ogy and pro­fes­sional ser­vices, im­pos­ing man­power quo­tas, nam­ing re­cal­ci­trant firms, and re­mov­ing pref­er­en­tial tax rates or not award­ing them pub­lic sec­tor con­tracts, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Trades Union Congress as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Pa­trick Tay urged mem­bers to re­think the no­tion that fair em­ploy­ment leg­is­la­tion is not in­vest­ment­friendly, as it has not stopped the likes of Lon­don and New York from be­ing vi­brant fi­nan­cial cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to calls for such leg­is­la­tion, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said it is a blunt but not “un­think­able” tool.</p>
    <p>While the Gov­ern­ment is open to all op­tions, she ex­plained that proac­tive sur­veil­lance has in fact been car­ried out un­der the Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work.</p>
    <p>Se­cond, on race, the Gov­ern­ment re­it­er­ated that it is pre­ma­ture to say that Sin­ga­pore has achieved the ideal of a race-blind so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>It may have be­come less race-con­scious, but it has not ar­rived at a “post-racial” state, said Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong.</p>
    <p>But the op­po­si­tion felt that race-based poli­cies, such as the Eth­nic In­te­gra­tion Pol­icy and eth­nic self-help groups, could nev­er­the­less be re­viewed.</p>
    <p>“My point was that we should not keep talk­ing our­selves down or be held back by the past,” said Work­ers’ Party (WP) chair­man Sylvia Lim.</p>
    <p>Third, build­ing a fair and just so­ci­ety. Se­cond Min­is­ter for Ed­u­ca­tion Ma­liki Os­man said so­ci­ety must have a con­sen­sus on what is a ba­sic and rea­son­able stan­dard of liv­ing the Gov­ern­ment can com­mit to pro­vide, bear­ing in mind that in­creases in sup­port are paid for by ev­ery­one through taxes.</p>
    <p>The WP’s As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ja­mus Lim (Sengkang GRC) pro­posed a min­i­mum wage, al­though he did not sug­gest spe­cific num­bers.</p>
    <p>Var­i­ous PAP MPs pointed out plans to ex­pand the ex­ist­ing Pro­gres­sive Wage Model, which is a min­i­mum wage-plus for­mula dif­fer­en­ti­ated across sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Be­yond sub­stance, the de­bate also re­vealed fun­da­men­tal dif­fer­ences in ap­proach be­tween the in­cum­bent and the op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>The PAP min­is­ters stressed the need for flex­i­ble prag­ma­tism, fis­cal pru­dence, and ev­i­dence-based poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said on Wed­nes­day that de­bates must be based on prin­ci­ples and fact, and guided by shared ideas and goals. These in­clude pro­tect­ing Sin­ga­pore’s se­cu­rity, grow­ing its econ­omy, and se­cur­ing its fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“If we do that, then there’s a ba­sis for us to man­age the in­her­ent ten­sions in our sys­tem, and for pol­i­tics to work out pro­duc­tively,” he said.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion S. Iswaran urged mem­bers to not just be a voice of the peo­ple, but also a voice of rea­son – “hon­est about the choices and trade-offs – not just about what we want, but also what we have to give up... and ul­ti­mately what we be­lieve to be in the long-term in­ter­ests of our cit­i­zens”.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, the op­po­si­tion ar­gued that ex­ist­ing in­sti­tu­tions and poli­cies need not be bro­ken in or­der to con­sider new mod­els of think­ing and work­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim, for in­stance, called for an open con­ver­sa­tion on whether bet­ter out­comes can be achieved by amal­ga­mat­ing eth­nic self-help groups un­der one na­tional um­brella.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers within its ranks, in par­tic­u­lar Progress Sin­ga­pore Party’s Non-Con­stituency MP Leong Mun Wai, took a harder Sin­ga­porean-first stance on the is­sue of hir­ing chief ex­ec­u­tives of fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>What does this mean for the fu­ture of Par­lia­ment de­bate?</p>
    <p>Some pos­i­tives have emerged, but a few ar­eas can be im­proved.</p>
    <p>First, MPs are en­gag­ing one an­other bet­ter, with sharper ques­tion­ing as well as replies on both sides.</p>
    <p>Ide­ally, this means less reliance on stock phrases and pre­pared speeches, and a height­ened need to ques­tion long-held as­sump­tions.</p>
    <p>Se­cond, they are ac­knowl­edg­ing more openly that both sides wish to work to­wards the com­mon good, even if they dis­agree on how to do so.</p>
    <p>The Prime Min­is­ter set the bench­mark for this on Wed­nes­day, when Leader of the Op­po­si­tion Pri­tam Singh spoke of fair­ness in pol­i­tics and the pub­lic’s de­sire to have an op­po­si­tion in the House.</p>
    <p>PM Lee took pains to stress that he did not un­der­value Mr Singh’s mo­ti­va­tions, his pas­sion or his de­sire to do right by Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>He then went on to ex­plain in de­tail, the un­der­ly­ing prin­ci­ples and mind­set by which the</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment de­cides whether to tap the na­tion’s re­serves.</p>
    <p>But it is still early days.</p>
    <p>The ad­ver­sar­ial dy­namic that is in­her­ent in the par­lia­men­tary sys­tem can go wrong. Al­ready, there was some clos­ing of ranks on the more thorny is­sues this week.</p>
    <p>On for­eign man­power and min­i­mum wage, MPs fired salvos at one an­other in rapid suc­ces­sion, with­out nec­es­sar­ily mak­ing head­way on both is­sues.</p>
    <p>Also, time con­straints mean that Par­lia­ment may not be the best plat­form to think things through and bro­ker con­sen­sus.</p>
    <p>On this, it is worth not­ing Mr Singh’s sug­ges­tion to have more Se­lect Com­mit­tees, given that cur­rently, gov­ern­ment par­lia­men­tary committee mem­bers come from only the PAP.</p>
    <p>Mr Mu­rali Pil­lai (Bukit Ba­tok SMC) also made two notable pro­pos­als: First, tak­ing MP speeches as read, so that time in the House is spent on gen­uine de­bate and points of clar­i­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Se­cond, a par­lia­men­tary record of MPs’ pro­pos­als that min­is­ters agreed to study, to track whether they fol­lowed through on their hold­ing replies.</p>
    <p>The Prime Min­is­ter has called on mem­bers of the House to raise their game.</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion can­not only ask ques­tions but must pro­pose al­ter­na­tive poli­cies, and pre­pare facts and fig­ures to back them up.</p>
    <p>The in­cum­bent must con­sider its pro­pos­als se­ri­ously, and work out a mech­a­nism to fol­low up on them where fea­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Some form of pol­icy sand­box may be needed on is­sues where a con­sen­sus can­not be reached, but where both sides can agree on the need to ex­plore fur­ther.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, pub­lic un­hap­pi­ness in re­cent years has gone be­yond ob­jec­tive in­di­ca­tors of progress such as in­come and ed­u­ca­tion – which on most counts have im­proved – to en­com­pass the “felt” re­al­ity of Sin­ga­pore­ans, that in­cre­men­tal and cau­tious solutions may not ad­e­quately ad­dress.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam said on Thurs­day that no per­son should as­sume that he has a mo­nop­oly over com­pas­sion.</p>
    <p>If both sides can marry rea­son with com­pas­sion and courage, and make a sin­cere ef­fort to move the con­ver­sa­tion for­ward, this lit­tle red dot can con­tinue to defy the odds and emerge stronger.</p>
