    <p>Work­ers in the aero­space sec­tor, heav­ily bat­tered by the Covid-19 pan­demic, can now ac­cess more train­ing cour­ses with higher rates of sub­si­dies.</p>
    <p>More than 13,000 train­ing places across about 100 cour­ses will be made avail­able to the sec­tor. The train­ing will cover top­ics such as air­craft main­te­nance, an­a­lyt­ics and robotics op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Work­ers who go for the train­ing will con­tinue to re­ceive their pay dur­ing the train­ing pe­riod, with wage and course fee sub­si­dies of up to 90 per cent.</p>
    <p>Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing and Min­is­ter of State for Man­power Gan Siow Huang an­nounced the sup­port mea­sure, which is ex­pected to cost about $14 mil­lion, dur­ing a visit to the Sin­ga­pore Aero En­gine Ser­vices fa­cil­ity in Loyang yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The cour­ses will be con­ducted by the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, NTUC Learn­ingHub, SIA En­gi­neer­ing Com­pany, ST En­gi­neer­ing Aero­space and Te­masek Poly­tech­nic.</p>
    <p>The mea­sure is an ex­ten­sion of the En­hanced Train­ing Sup­port Pack­age, which had ini­tially been of­fered to six other in­dus­tries hard hit by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>So far, more than 35,000 em­ploy­ees from 920 busi­nesses in tourism, air trans­port, re­tail, food ser­vices, land trans­port and arts and cul­ture have tapped the pack­age. As a worker can take more than one course, a to­tal of 84,000 train­ing places have been taken up.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said that while the aero­space sec­tor has been hit by a fall in de­mand, its medium- to long-term prospects are still good.</p>
    <p>“We are not just in­vest­ing in the skills for the cur­rent gen­er­a­tion of en­gines but also in new skills, in­clud­ing the dig­i­tal skills to man­age the new gen­er­a­tion of en­gines that will pro­pel the avi­a­tion sec­tor,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan also em­pha­sised the long-term im­por­tance of re­tain­ing work­ers in the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that the ca­pa­bil­i­ties in the aero­space in­dus­try are unique, he said: “It is not some­thing that you can pick up and then let go, be­fore com­ing back (to it) again. So it is im­por­tant that we con­tinue to main­tain a cer­tain con­sis­tency in the work­flow... with­out which it will be very hard for us to ramp up the num­ber of qual­i­fied en­gi­neers re­quired for the in­dus­try when de­mand re­turns.”</p>
    <p>Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore and the Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board said the ad­di­tional train­ing sup­port will help tide the sec­tor over the cur­rent cri­sis and pre­pare for re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>The aero­space sec­tor ac­counted for 1 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct and churned out $13.1 bil­lion in out­put last year. It em­ploys more than 22,000 work­ers, of whom 74 per cent are pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses in the aero­space sec­tor range from those do­ing air­craft main­te­nance, re­pair and over­haul to those man­u­fac­tur­ing plane com­po­nents. Com­pa­nies in the re­lated avi­a­tion sec­tor in­clude com­mer­cial car­ri­ers like Sin­ga­pore Air­lines and cargo han­dlers.</p>
    <p>But as de­mand for air travel has been al­most wiped out by the Covid-19 pan­demic, both sec­tors have been hit hard.</p>
    <p>Aero­space gi­ant Pratt & Whit­ney last month laid off around 400 em­ploy­ees – 20 per cent of its work­force – at five of its six fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Sazali Zainal, vice-chair­man of the NTUC Aero­space and Avi­a­tion Clus­ter and pres­i­dent of the</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore In­dus­trial and Ser­vices Em­ploy­ees’ Union, said that the unions have been lob­by­ing hard for an en­hanced train­ing and sup­port pack­age as part of ef­forts to save jobs.</p>
    <p>He urged com­pa­nies to take ad­van­tage of this op­por­tu­nity to fur­ther train work­ers and to work with the unions to over­come any chal­lenges they may face.</p>
    <p>Mr Sia Kheng Yok, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Aero­space In­dus­tries, said the Covid-19 pan­demic has sped up in­dus­try and tech­nol­ogy changes, which in turn have made it more ur­gent to up­skill work­ers.</p>
    <p>He said the aero­space com­mu­nity wel­comed the en­hanced train­ing sup­port, and added: “It is an en­cour­age­ment to pre­pare work­ers for changes ahead, and to re­new and re­in­force our core ca­pa­bil­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>SKILLS FOR THE FU­TURE</p>
    <p>We are not just in­vest­ing in the skills for the cur­rent gen­er­a­tion of en­gines but also in new skills, in­clud­ing the dig­i­tal skills to man­age the new gen­er­a­tion of en­gines that will pro­pel the avi­a­tion sec­tor.</p>
