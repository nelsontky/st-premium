    <p>•</p>
    <p>LON­DON The “Big Three” ri­valry be­tween Roger Fed­erer, Rafael Nadal and No­vak Djokovic has pro­duced epic matches that con­tinue to be talked about years down the road.</p>
    <p>But fresh off his maiden ATP Fi­nals vic­tory at the O2 Arena in Lon­don, Daniil Medvedev feels the younger gen­er­a­tion of ten­nis stars have the po­ten­tial to cre­ate their own ri­val­ries to match the sport’s big­gest stars and in turn, cap­ture the pub­lic’s imag­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>The Rus­sian, who lost all three of his group matches last year, com­pleted a re­mark­able week with a 4-6, 7-6 (7-2), 6-4 win over US Open cham­pion Do­minic Thiem on Sun­day to land the big­gest ti­tle of his career.</p>
    <p>His vic­tory over the world No. 3, fol­low­ing a semi-fi­nal win over 20-time Grand Slam win­ner and French Open cham­pion Nadal and a group-stage win over top-ranked Djokovic, means he is only the fourth player to beat the three topranked men in a sin­gle event.</p>
    <p>He joins David Nal­ban­dian (Madrid 2007), Djokovic (Mon­treal 2007) and Boris Becker (Stock­holm 1994).</p>
    <p>He also be­came the fifth suc­ces­sive first-time win­ner of the ti­tle. Alexan­der Zverev, 23, and Ste­fanos Tsit­si­pas, 22, won the last two ti­tles here while Bul­gar­ian Grigor Dim­itrov won in 2017 but none have gone on to claim a Grand Slam.</p>
    <p>But there are signs the gap to the “Big Three” is clos­ing.</p>
    <p>Thiem made the break­through at Flush­ing Mead­ows, be­com­ing the first player other than Djokovic, Nadal or Fed­erer to land a Slam since 2016 and giv­ing en­cour­age­ment to his peers.</p>
    <p>With Fed­erer now aged 39,</p>
    <p>Nadal 34, and 17-time Ma­jor win­ner Djokovic 33, their in­cred­i­ble ri­val­ries have a lim­ited time to run.</p>
    <p>The hope is for Medvedev, Thiem, Tsit­si­pas, US Open fi­nal­ist Zverev and Cana­dian De­nis Shapo­valov to soon pro­vide sim­i­lar block­buster ri­val­ries.</p>
    <p>Asked if his ri­valry with Thiem, 3-2 in the Aus­trian’s favour, can de­velop into some­thing spe­cial, fourth-ranked Medvedev said: “Hope­fully, we can be there for a long time, maybe let’s say push­ing the other gen­er­a­tions back.</p>
    <p>“The top three, they prob­a­bly went through two, three gen­er­a­tions with­out drop­ping their level, which is not easy.</p>
    <p>“But what is def­i­nitely good from us, from Do­minic, from me, if we talk about this tour­na­ment, we man­aged both to beat Rafa and No­vak, which is an amaz­ing ac­com­plish­ment.</p>
    <p>“It can give me a lot for my fu­ture career, Not even talk­ing about the ti­tle it­self. It means a lot.</p>
    <p>“It shows what I’m ca­pa­ble of when I’m feel­ing good men­tally and phys­i­cally.”</p>
    <p>Thiem agreed that the new van­guard would con­tinue to push the “Big Three”, adding: “For ten­nis there are ex­cit­ing times com­ing. Su­per im­por­tant for the sport in gen­eral.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing ended the year on a 10-match win­ning streak, in­clud­ing the Paris Masters ti­tle, Medvedev will head into next year brim­ming with con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>“To beat Do­minic the way he played to­day and to man­age to beat him is prob­a­bly my best vic­tory of my life,” he said.</p>
    <p>Af­ter 12 years in Lon­don, the ATP Fi­nals will be staged in Turin, Italy from next year till 2025.</p>
