    <p>She is a barista with a very strong arm.</p>
    <p>And, from yes­ter­day, “Ella”, Sin­ga­pore’s first fully au­to­mated ro­bot barista, has been serv­ing cus­tomers their caf­feine fixes at an un­manned out­let at CT Hub 2 in Laven­der.</p>
    <p>Crown Group, which launched the out­let un­der its food and bev­er­age arm Crown Cof­fee, said it was de­vel­oped in an ef­fort to push au­to­ma­tion and re­duce phys­i­cal in­ter­ac­tions in the light of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ella, named after Crown Group founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive Keith Tan’s wife, served a range of hot drinks to Min­is­ter of State for Trade and In­dus­try Low Yen Ling and mem­bers of the me­dia at a launch event last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>In a speech at the event, Ms Low, who is also Min­is­ter of State for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth, em­pha­sised the im­por­tance of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and au­to­ma­tion in nav­i­gat­ing the pan­demic, and zoomed in on Ella as a so­lu­tion that cre­ates op­por­tu­nity from chaos.</p>
    <p>“While Covid-19 has se­verely im­pacted our busi­nesses and econ­omy, it has also cre­ated the im­pe­tus for us to build stronger busi­ness ca­pa­bil­i­ties and seek out new growth op­por­tu­ni­ties,” she said.</p>
    <p>Crown Cof­fee’s new ro­bot barista is able to make up to 200 cups of cof­fee an hour. It joins a host of new in­no­va­tions spurred by Covid-19, such as clean­ing ro­bots.</p>
    <p>Ella brews and serves cof­fee be­hind a trans­par­ent screen in a con­tact­less set-up. Users have to down­load the Crown Cof­fee mo­bile app to or­der drinks, from $4 each.</p>
    <p>De­vel­oped by Crown Group’s tech­nol­ogy arm Crown Dig­i­tal, Ella is Mr Tan’s re­sponse to the cost pres­sures of train­ing and re­tain­ing hu­man work­ers, and a pre-emp­tive an­swer to dig­i­tal dis­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>“We need to dis­rupt our­selves, as op­posed to wait­ing for things to change,” said the for­mer wealth man­ager, who started Crown Group in 2016 to fol­low his pas­sion for cof­fee.</p>
    <p>Ella has been in de­vel­op­ment since 2017, when the first pro­to­type was built.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan, 40, said Ella is part of his com­pany’s aim to serve con­sis­tent, barista-qual­ity cof­fee to more peo­ple con­ve­niently.</p>
    <p>He added: “Ella’s main ap­pli­ca­tion will be in high-traf­fic ar­eas like MRT sta­tions or air­ports. Imag­ine you’re on your way to work and you or­der your cof­fee from the mo­bile app, and when you get to the sta­tion your cof­fee is wait­ing for you.”</p>
    <p>Crown Group is cur­rently seek­ing fund­ing to ex­pand Ella across Sin­ga­pore and be­yond, said a spokesman.</p>
    <p>Asked about the costs in­volved com­pared with em­ploy­ing hu­man baris­tas, Mr Tan said that it will take some time for any sav­ings from au­to­ma­tion to ac­crue.</p>
