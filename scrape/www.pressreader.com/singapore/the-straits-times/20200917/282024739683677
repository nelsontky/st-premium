    <p>It is com­mend­able that the Com­pe­ti­tion and Con­sumer Com­mis­sion of Sin­ga­pore (CCCS) has come up with a set of guide­lines that will take ef­fect on Nov 1 and ap­ply to all phys­i­cal and on­line sup­pli­ers. These spec­ify pric­ing prac­tices to pro­tect con­sumers from busi­nesses that en­gage in mis­lead­ing ad­ver­tis­ing. The guide­lines cover four ar­eas: drip pric­ing, which refers to fees added on to the ad­ver­tised price dur­ing the trans­ac­tion process; false or mis­lead­ing price com­par­isons; fake dis­counts; and use of the term “free”. The move comes as the CCCS looks at strength­en­ing its en­force­ment pow­ers in ad­min­is­ter­ing the Con­sumer Pro­tec­tion (Fair Trad­ing) Act, in­clud­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of be­ing able to im­pose fi­nan­cial penal­ties with­out hav­ing to go through the courts.</p>
    <p>It is fair to say that er­rant busi­nesses are be­ing put on no­tice that their old ways of net­ting un­sus­pect­ing buy­ers will pass in less than two months, and that they must pre­pare them­selves for a fairer bal­ance of in­ter­ests be­tween con­sumers and sup­pli­ers. In­deed, the new safe­guards are nec­es­sary to en­sure that mis­lead­ing pric­ing, which is still the ex­cep­tion, does not be­come the norm.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the CCCS notes that sup­pli­ers should en­sure that any un­avoid­able or manda­tory fees or charges, for ex­am­ple, taxes, sur­charges and ser­vice fees, are in­cluded in the to­tal head­line price. The sup­plier should alert the cus­tomer when such fees or charges can­not be cal­cu­lated rea­son­ably in ad­vance. This is an em­i­nently sen­si­ble po­si­tion and should not have re­quired ex­ter­nal in­ter­ven­tion. Now the writ­ing on the wall is clear.</p>
    <p>Other com­mon ex­am­ples of mal­prac­tice in­clude “clos­ing down sales” for busi­nesses that ev­i­dently never close down, or so-called dis­counts that go on for years. These, too, are mis­lead­ing be­cause they make con­sumers be­lieve that they should act im­me­di­ately to se­cure the ben­e­fits of a pro­mo­tional price, when in re­al­ity there is no such ur­gency. Also, in the process, er­rant busi­nesses gain an un­fair ad­van­tage over hon­est en­ter­prises that do not make such mis­rep­re­sen­ta­tions. Thus, mis­lead­ing ad­ver­tis­ing af­fects the mar­ket at large.</p>
    <p>As the CCCS notes, trans­parency in pric­ing al­lows con­sumers to make in­formed pur­chas­ing de­ci­sions. Pur­chas­ing be­hav­iour de­pends on per­cep­tion. While busi­nesses re­main free to in­flu­ence that per­cep­tion, they can­not do so in ways that are patently dis­hon­est. Trans­parency is cru­cial to the func­tion­ing of the mar­ket. It cre­ates trust, re­moves the fear that one is be­ing taken for a ride, and makes re­course to ex­ec­u­tive or ju­di­cial author­ity nec­es­sary only in the most ex­treme of cir­cum­stances. Sin­ga­pore’s in­ter­na­tional rep­u­ta­tion as a place to do busi­ness can­not but be tar­nished if there are busi­nesses within it that are tainted with the sus­pi­cion of way­ward prac­tices. The hon­est con­sumer must win.</p>
