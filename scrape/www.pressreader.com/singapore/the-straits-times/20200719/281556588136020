    <p>The vot­ers made it clear that they wanted a Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) gov­ern­ment at the helm by giv­ing it 61.2 per cent of the vote in the gen­eral elec­tion, but the re­sult fell slightly short of the party’s own ex­pec­ta­tions, said Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It was nev­er­the­less a solid ma­jor­ity, given the dif­fi­cul­ties that peo­ple were fac­ing on the ground, he added.</p>
    <p>“And that’s be­cause the base kept faith with the PAP, know­ing that the PAP kept faith with its base. What is this base? They are the work­ing class, the mid­dle class, the heart­land of Sin­ga­pore,” said Mr Wong, who shared the party’s pre­lim­i­nary anal­y­sis of the re­cent elec­tion.</p>
    <p>He ac­knowl­edged that the re­sult was lower than the 65 per cent the party had hoped for, with that 4 per­cent­age point gap trans­lat­ing to around 100,000 votes.</p>
    <p>To close the gap, the party must do bet­ter at ap­peal­ing to the young and work to ad­dress the eco­nomic pain of vot­ers in their 40s and 50s, Mr Wong said.</p>
    <p>“We are un­likely to ex­ceed 65 per cent of the vote in fu­ture,” he added. “The de­sire for diver­sity in Par­lia­ment, for checks and bal­ances, is per­ma­nent. It is here to stay, and we must be pre­pared for this new re­al­ity.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, a mem­ber of the PAP’s cen­tral ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee, was ad­dress­ing party ac­tivists in a speech streamed live from the PAP’s Be­dok head­quar­ters, and took ques­tions from re­porters af­ter­wards.</p>
    <p>Putting the party’s per­for­mance in con­text, he said pun­dits and com­men­ta­tors had pre­dicted that the PAP could get more than 70 per cent of the votes as vot­ers sought safety amid the on­go­ing Covid-19 pan­demic. The rul­ing party it­self did not ex­pect that, given the pain on the ground.</p>
    <p>In fact, over the past nine gen­eral elec­tions, it had ap­proached or sur­passed the 70 per cent mark only twice, said Mr Wong. In 2015, it got 69.9 per cent of the vote. In 2001, it won with a 75.3 per cent vote share. In con­trast, the party got 63 per cent or less in four out of these nine races, he added.</p>
    <p>This year’s re­sult is at the “low end of the ex­pected range”, which is be­tween 60 and 65 per cent.</p>
    <p>“It is not a very good re­sult, but it is within the range of ex­pec­ta­tions, and we’ve been here be­fore,” he added. “The ex­pec­ta­tion that the PAP should have had a re­sult at the top end this time, I think, has coloured the out­come as a set­back.”</p>
    <p>He set out sev­eral rea­sons for the PAP’s per­for­mance in the polls.</p>
    <p>First, the Work­ers’ Party ran a good cam­paign that spoke to the de­sire of many vot­ers to have more checks and bal­ances in Par­lia­ment, he said. The emer­gence of the Progress Sin­ga­pore Party cut into the PAP’s western stronghold­s.</p>
    <p>The PAP’s on­line cam­paign also did not con­nect well with vot­ers, Mr Wong noted. “We pro­duced a lot of good con­tent on­line, but not all of this con­nected with ne­ti­zens – espe­cially on newer plat­forms like In­sta­gram and Tele­gram.”</p>
    <p>While there has been much talk of younger vot­ers turn­ing away from the party, the swing against the PAP was also seen among vot­ers above 40, who make up a much larger pro­por­tion of the elec­torate, Mr Wong said. This group faced eco­nomic hard­ship due to job or in­come losses from the pan­demic, he added.</p>
    <p>The PAP also saw sup­port fall among those who lived in pri­vate prop­erty, who may have felt they were not suf­fi­ciently sup­ported dur­ing the cri­sis, he said.</p>
    <p>The party will con­duct a thor­ough re­view of the gen­eral elec­tion, iden­ti­fy­ing two ar­eas that the party will have to work on. It must bet­ter con­nect with younger vot­ers and ad­dress the “real eco­nomic pain” that a sub­stan­tial seg­ment of older vot­ers are feel­ing, he said.</p>
    <p>The em­pha­sis on the base will re­main un­changed. “Our poli­cies must al­ways tilt in favour of the less for­tu­nate and vul­ner­a­ble,” said Mr Wong. “This is in the PAP’s roots and DNA. We must never wa­ver in our com­mit­ment to so­cial jus­tice, to pre­serve so­cial mo­bil­ity for all Sin­ga­pore­ans, and to build a more fair and just so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>Our poli­cies must al­ways tilt in favour of the less for­tu­nate and vul­ner­a­ble. This is in the PAP’s roots and DNA. We must never wa­ver in our com­mit­ment to so­cial jus­tice, to pre­serve so­cial mo­bil­ity for all Sin­ga­pore­ans, and to build a more fair and just so­ci­ety.’’ NA­TIONAL DE­VEL­OP­MENT MIN­IS­TER LAWRENCE WONG</p>
    <p>The fall in sup­port for the rul­ing party was not solely among younger vot­ers, but also among other groups such as work­ers in their 40s and 50s who were feel­ing the pain caused by the pan­demic, said Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>These older vot­ers had swung to the op­po­si­tion pri­mar­ily be­cause they had suf­fered in­come or job losses, had their busi­nesses dis­rupted, or were forced to down­size to lower-pay­ing jobs, he said.</p>
    <p>He said it was not the case that the young had aban­doned the PAP na­tion­ally, as there were many polling dis­tricts and con­stituen­cies with such vot­ers where the party re­ceived good sup­port, like in Pung­gol West where it won 61 per cent of the votes.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, who is in the PAP’s cen­tral ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee, was ad­dress­ing party ac­tivists vir­tu­ally from the PAP head­quar­ters in</p>
    <p>Be­dok, where he summed up the rea­sons that the rul­ing party per­formed worse than ex­pected.</p>
    <p>The PAP had hoped to garner 65 per cent of the votes, but re­ceived 61.2 per cent in­stead.</p>
    <p>First, the Work­ers’ Party ran a good cam­paign that spoke to the de­sire of many vot­ers to have more checks and bal­ances in Par­lia­ment, Mr Wong said.</p>
    <p>This year also saw the emer­gence of the Progress Sin­ga­pore Party, which cut into the PAP’s stronghold­s, espe­cially in the west.</p>
    <p>An­other con­tribut­ing fac­tor was that the PAP’s on­line cam­paign did not con­nect well with vot­ers, Mr Wong said, adding: “We tried our best. We pro­duced a lot of good con­tent on­line, but not all of this con­nected with ne­ti­zens – espe­cially on newer plat­forms like In­sta­gram and Tele­gram where the plat­forms re­quire dif­fer­ent sort of con­tent, say, from a plat­form like Face­book.”</p>
    <p>He added: “And as with a nor­mal cam­paign, the neg­a­tive mes­sages carry fur­ther reach than pos­i­tive mes­sages, and this is fur­ther ac­cen­tu­ated on the In­ter­net.”</p>
    <p>He noted that much of the post­elec­tion com­men­tary has fo­cused on younger vot­ers and how they have turned away from the PAP.</p>
    <p>But vot­ers in their 20s and 30s made up only a third of the elec­torate, with first-time vot­ers aged be­tween 21 and 24 mak­ing up less than 10 per cent of the vote.</p>
    <p>“So the swing against the PAP was not con­cen­trated solely among the young. And it was not just un­hap­pi­ness about the PAP style of cam­paign­ing, or how we talked about race, or Pofma,” he said, re­fer­ring to the Pro­tec­tion from On­line False­hoods and Ma­nip­u­la­tion Act.</p>
    <p>Vot­ers in their 40s and 50s, and per­haps even those in their early 60s, also voted against the PAP be­cause of the “real eco­nomic pains” they faced. Many in this sand­wiched group are look­ing af­ter both elderly par­ents and young chil­dren, and faced dif­fi­cul­ties even be­fore the pan­demic hit.</p>
    <p>“But since then, I think the chal­lenges have been ex­ac­er­bated,” said Mr Wong, not­ing that many schemes rolled out un­der this year’s four Bud­gets were tar­geted at help­ing this group.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately, no amount of help will be enough in a cri­sis of this mag­ni­tude. So, we will con­tinue to re­view and up­date our poli­cies, and we will do what­ever we can to ad­dress your anx­i­eties and pain dur­ing this dif­fi­cult pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>PAP also saw sup­port fall among those who lived in pri­vate prop­erty, al­though this was not uni­formly the case across all pri­vate es­tates.</p>
    <p>Vot­ers in these es­tates could have felt that they were not suf­fi­ciently sup­ported dur­ing the cri­sis, Mr Wong said. “They might be busi­ness own­ers, they might be SME own­ers, and they would be fac­ing con­sid­er­able eco­nomic dif­fi­cul­ties.”</p>
    <p>At a press con­fer­ence af­ter his ad­dress, he was asked if some of these find­ings – such as the need to con­nect bet­ter with younger vot­ers and im­prove the party’s on­line cam­paign – were new to the PAP.</p>
    <p>Both these two is­sues had been thrown up af­ter the 2011 elec­tion, and are a “work in progress”, he replied.</p>
    <p>Other is­sues, such as the se­vere eco­nomic dif­fi­cul­ties faced by many seg­ments of the pop­u­la­tion, are brand new, he added.</p>
    <p>Al­though the PAP was aware of these is­sues, the cri­sis was of such mag­ni­tude that they could not be re­solved quickly de­spite gov­ern</p>
    <p>ment in­ter­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>“No mat­ter what kinds of re­sources that you can mount to help them, it is re­ally very hard to talk about busi­nesses that are fac­ing dif­fi­cul­ties, con­trac­tors who are un­able to work be­cause their work­ers still need to be cleared in the dor­mi­to­ries,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong added: “That’s why we knew, go­ing into the elec­tion, that this was a chal­lenge, and I think the re­sults have shown that... there are is­sues aris­ing from this par­tic­u­lar seg­ment, and we will have to con­tinue to work hard at think­ing about ways we can help this group ad­dress the dif­fi­cul­ties through this cri­sis.”</p>
