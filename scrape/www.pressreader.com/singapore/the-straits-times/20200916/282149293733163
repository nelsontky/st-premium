    <p>De­vel­oped by Ap­ple and pub­lic health ex­perts at the Health Pro­mo­tion Board, Lu­miHealth is tai­lored to Sin­ga­pore users in terms of health is­sues that are im­por­tant to the pop­u­la­tion here, said HPB.</p>
    <p>Your Ap­ple Watch could soon beep to re­mind you when it is time for your health screen­ing or im­mu­ni­sa­tion, thanks to a new app de­vel­oped by the Health Pro­mo­tion Board (HPB).</p>
    <p>Called Lu­miHealth, the free app to be launched in late Oc­to­ber will also help users set fit­ness goals and healthy eat­ing tar­gets after draw­ing be­havioural in­sights from the users’ sleep­ing, health and fit­ness ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>It is part of Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional drive to pro­mote a healthy life­style through the use of tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>De­vel­oped by Ap­ple and pub­lic health ex­perts at HPB, Lu­miHealth is tai­lored to Sin­ga­pore users in terms of health is­sues that are im­por­tant to the pop­u­la­tion here, said HPB.</p>
    <p>Per­son­alised nudges and re­minders about phys­i­cal ac­tiv­ity lev­els or diet can, for in­stance, help to pre­vent or de­lay the on­set of ill­nesses and chronic dis­eases such as di­a­betes or help one bet­ter manage these dis­eases.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said: “Even as all of us around the world are deal­ing with the chal­lenges of Covid-19, we must keep in­vest­ing in our fu­ture. And there is no bet­ter in­vest­ment than in our per­sonal health.”</p>
    <p>He added: “This part­ner­ship be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Ap­ple will en­able Sin­ga­pore­ans to lead health­ier lives.”</p>
    <p>Ap­ple’s chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer,</p>
    <p>Mr Jeff Wil­liams, said: “Sin­ga­pore has one of the world’s lead­ing health­care sys­tems and we are thrilled to be part­ner­ing with them to in­cor­po­rate Ap­ple Watch and Lu­miHealth into their holis­tic ap­proach to well-be­ing.”</p>
    <p>Fit­ness goals are gam­i­fied in the app, with a friendly char­ac­ter guid­ing users through dif­fer­ent worlds and tasks, per­son­alised ac­cord­ing to age, gen­der and weight. These tasks in­clude weekly ac­tiv­ity goals that can be met by walk­ing, swim­ming, do­ing yoga and other ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Users can also take part in well­ness chal­lenges that aim to im­prove sleep habits as well as en­cour­age bet­ter food choices.</p>
    <p>For the two-year span of HPB’s Lu­miHealth pro­gramme (www.lu­mihealth.sg), users who com­plete these tasks and chal­lenges will be able to earn re­wards worth up to $380 i n HPB eVouch­ers from stores like FairPrice, Sheng Siong and Tangs.</p>
    <p>The app also re­minds users to go for health screen­ings and rel­e­vant im­mu­ni­sa­tions based on their de­mo­graphic pro­file de­tails such as age and gen­der.</p>
    <p>Lu­miHealth is open only to Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents aged 17 years or older with a SingPass ac­count. It re­quires an iPhone run­ning iOS 13 or later, and an Ap­ple Watch with at least watchOS 6 in or­der for peo­ple to use the app.</p>
    <p>Data and health in­sights gath­ered by Lu­miHealth will help shape fu­ture health ini­tia­tives to im­prove the qual­ity of Sin­ga­pore­ans’ lives. How­ever, the shar­ing of health data is de­pen­dent on the user’s con­sent.</p>
    <p>The col­lec­tion of per­sonal iden­ti­fi­able data is min­imised and used only to ad­min­is­ter the pro­gramme, for ex­am­ple, us­ing e-mail ad­dresses to en­sure that the cor­rect in­cen­tives are awarded to the right par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>The data will be coded, se­cured and stored in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Asked why the app is avail­able only on Ap­ple Watches, HPB said its long-term goal is to work with var­i­ous de­vice and tech­nol­ogy part­ners “to in­creas­ingly lever­age tech­nol­ogy for our pro­grammes”.</p>
    <p>“This will cre­ate an ecosys­tem of tech­nol­ogy-en­abled health pro­mo­tion pro­grammes that can tar­get dif­fer­ent seg­ments of the pop­u­la­tion,” the agency said.</p>
    <p>While Lu­miHealth is de­signed specif­i­cally for Ap­ple Watches, HPB said those who have other wear­able de­vices can take part in other healthy liv­ing pro­grammes such as the Na­tional Steps Chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Lu­miHealth will com­ple­ment other HPB pop­u­la­tion-wide pro­grammes, such as the Healthy 365 app (avail­able on both An­droid and iOS), to reach as many Sin­ga­pore­ans as pos­si­ble.</p>
