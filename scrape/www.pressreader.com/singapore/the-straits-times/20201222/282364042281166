    <p>• Oil fell to less than US$48 a bar­rel in Asian trad­ing – af­ter post­ing a sev­enth weekly gain – on con­cern a Covid-19 mu­ta­tion dis­cov­ered in Bri­tain could speed the virus’ trans­mis­sion and lead to more lock­downs.</p>
    <p>Fu­tures in New York dropped nearly 3 per cent af­ter clos­ing at the high­est level in al­most 10 months last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Over 16 mil­lion Bri­tons are now re­quired to stay at home as a full lock­down came into force in Lon­don and the south-east of Eng­land, with some Euro­pean coun­tries lim­it­ing travel with Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>A stronger dol­lar also re­duced the ap­peal of com­modi­ties that are priced in the cur­rency, while a stim­u­lus deal in the United States could not stem the slide.</p>
    <p>Phys­i­cal oil prices are also fall­ing as Asian re­fin­ers ease pur­chases af­ter an ear­lier-thanusual buy­ing spree.</p>
    <p>Abu Dhabi’s Mur­ban crude was sold last week on the spot mar­ket be­low its of­fi­cial sell­ing price for the first time since Au­gust, while dif­fer­en­tials for Rus­sia’s Espo have fallen from a six­month high.</p>
    <p>Crude has ral­lied around 33 per cent since the end of Oc­to­ber on a se­ries of vac­cine break­throughs that have cre­ated ex­pec­ta­tions for a re­cov­ery in en­ergy de­mand next year.</p>
    <p>In the short term, how­ever, prices are be­ing buf­feted by the fast-spread­ing virus lead­ing to more stay-at-home or­ders.</p>
    <p>“We have quite a bit of spec­u­la­tive money in oil at the mo­ment, at­tracted by the more con­struc­tive out­look for 2021,” said Mr War­ren Pat­ter­son, head of com­modi­ties strat­egy at ING Groep.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, if we start see­ing the virus mu­tat­ing, I imag­ine some of th­ese spec­u­la­tors will be­come a bit more skit­tish.”</p>
    <p>Oil is a vac­cine trade right now with ro­bust de­mand seen in the sec­ond half of next year as more peo­ple re­sume fly­ing, Dr Jeff Cur­rie, the head of com­modi­ties re­search at Gold­man Sachs Group, said in a Bloomberg tele­vi­sion in­ter­view last Fri­day. That is when Opec+ can re­turn more sup­plies to the mar­ket, he said.</p>
    <p>The al­liance will re­act faster to changes and take a more hand­son ap­proach with the oil mar­ket, thanks to its ac­cel­er­ated sched­ule of monthly meet­ings, Rus­sia and Saudi Ara­bia, the group’s lead­ers, said over the week­end.</p>
    <p>Oil’s fu­tures curve is re­flect­ing the con­flict­ing long- and short­term sig­nals. Brent’s prompt time spread is 4 US cents a bar­rel in con­tango, a bear­ish sig­nal where near-dated con­tracts are cheaper than later-dated ones.</p>
    <p>“Ris­ing in­fec­tion rates and the in­sti­tu­tion of lock­down mea­sures are start­ing to have an im­pact on sen­ti­ment,” said CMC Mar­kets Asia-Pa­cific chief mar­ket strate­gist Michael McCarthy. He added he was a “lit­tle sur­prised” the mar­ket was so neg­a­tive given the progress on the US stim­u­lus plan.</p>
