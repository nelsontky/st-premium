    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has up­ended lives in the phys­i­cal world, but even the spir­i­tual realm has not been spared.</p>
    <p>The Hun­gry Ghost Fes­ti­val that be­gins to­day has been trans­formed, with main­stays like live auc­tions and flashy ge­tai per­for­mances – tra­di­tion­ally held dur­ing the sev­enth lu­nar month – no­tice­ably ab­sent this year.</p>
    <p>Mass prayers, ac­com­pa­nied by the buzz and clang of re­li­gious mu­sic, have also been sig­nif­i­cantly scaled down to meet gov­ern­ment guide­lines amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>At Toa Payoh Seu Teck Sean Tong tem­ple, it is cus­tom­ary at this time of the year to see the open-air carpark trans­formed, with neat rows of ta­bles bear­ing some 2,700 ances­tral tablets for fam­ily mem­bers to of­fer prayers and of­fer­ings. But the tablet set-up will be ab­sent this year.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, safe dis­tanc­ing rules mean the tem­ple can serve only about 400 devo­tees a day, less than half the usual sev­enth month crowd, said Mr Chia Kok Peng, vicechair­man of the tem­ple’s board.</p>
    <p>The 10,000 devo­tees who usu­ally take part in the tem­ple’s an­nual sev­enth month prayers will also miss the oc­ca­sion on Sept 6 – the prayers will be con­ducted be­hind closed doors by a hand­ful of vol­un­teers.</p>
    <p>Prayer rit­u­als at Chia Leng Kong Heng Kang Tian Tem­ple in Si­lat Road will like­wise be trun­cated, said tem­ple com­mit­tee mem­ber Kiong Han Wei.</p>
    <p>Bois­ter­ous open-air ban­quets, usu­ally held on the 15th day of the lu­nar month, will also be no­tice­ably ab­sent.</p>
    <p>The din­ner hosted by Lorong Koo Chye Sheng Hong Tem­ple that draws up to 4,000 at­ten­dees each year has been can­celled, while the live auc­tion will be con­ducted silently. Ge­tai per­for­mances spon­sored by the tem­ple will be streamed on­line, from Aug 30 to Sept 1.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses that usu­ally do well dur­ing the sev­enth month have also been hit. Large re­li­gious-goods whole­salers that cater to tem­ples and com­pa­nies have it worse, given that prayers have been scaled down, said Mr Alex Teo, as­sis­tant sec­re­tary of the Sin­ga­pore Re­li­gious Goods Mer­chants As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“The guide­lines for sev­enth month prayers came in less than two weeks be­fore the start of the month, so many of our reg­u­lar clients were hes­i­tant to place their or­ders for prayer items,” said Mr Teo, the third-gen­er­a­tion owner of whole­saler Ban Kah Hiang Trad­ing.</p>
    <p>He ex­pects this year’s sev­enth month sales to be at least 30 per cent less than last year’s. He added that joss paper shops in the heart­land are likely to be less af­fected, as fam­i­lies are still al­lowed to pray in com­mon ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Live shows have also had to adapt to the new rules, to vary­ing de­grees of suc­cess.</p>
    <p>Ge­tai or­gan­iser Aaron Tan said his usual slate of 50 live shows dur­ing the sev­enth month has dropped to 29 as of yes­ter­day – one on each day of the sev­enth month – and all of them will take place vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>Groups like the 156-year-old Lao Sai Tao Yuan Teochew Opera Troupe are strug­gling to cope with the changes.</p>
    <p>“The sev­enth month is our busiest month, but with this year’s re­stric­tions, our usual 20 or more per­for­mances have all been can­celled,” said the troupe’s leader Nick Shen.</p>
    <p>But the in­dus­try is in­no­vat­ing. The troupe’s first on­line show will be live-streamed on Face­book page Tok Tok Chi­ang and zhongyuan­fes­ti­val.sg early next month.</p>
    <p>The web­site, put to­gether by a group of cre­atives, will be launched to­day, and will hope­fully draw a new gen­er­a­tion to un­der­stand and en­joy sev­enth month cel­e­bra­tions, said project leader Ivan Yak.</p>
    <p>Other ef­forts to dig­i­talise this year’s sev­enth month fes­tiv­i­ties in­clude a spe­cial ge­tai edi­tion of the Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Cul­tural Cen­tre’s TGIF Mu­sic Sta­tion se­ries.</p>
    <p>To be live-streamed on the cen­tre’s Face­book page on Sept 4, the show will fea­ture ge­tai veter­ans and next-gen­er­a­tion stars like Lee Pei Fen, Hao Hao and Des­mond Ng.</p>
    <p>“In these chal­leng­ing times when ge­tai per­for­mances are not able to pro­ceed phys­i­cally, artists and or­gan­is­ers can still come to­gether cre­atively to en­sure that our tra­di­tions are pre­served and con­tin­ued for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions,” said the cen­tre’s pro­gramme di­rec­tor, Mr Lee Ee Wurn.</p>

Safe dis&#xAD;tanc&#xAD;ing rules mean that the tem&#xAD;ple can serve only about 400 devo&#xAD;tees a day dur&#xAD;ing the Hun&#xAD;gry Ghost Fes&#xAD;ti&#xAD;val this year, less than half its usual sev&#xAD;enth lu&#xAD;nar month crowd.</p>
