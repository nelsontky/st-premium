    <p>• The In­dian Cus­toms has seized a con­tainer with 740 tonnes of am­mo­nium ni­trate, the chem­i­cal that caused this week’s deadly blast in Le­banon’s cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>More than 150 peo­ple were killed and more than 5,000 were in­jured when a large stock of the chem­i­cal ex­ploded at Beirut’s port on Tues­day. Dozens of peo­ple are miss­ing and up to 250,000 are without hab­it­able homes.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties in the south In­dian port city of Chen­nai said a large con­sign­ment of the chem­i­cal had been stored at a site about 20km from the city.</p>
    <p>“The seized cargo is se­curely stored and safety of the cargo and pub­lic is en­sured con­sid­er­ing the haz­ardous na­ture of the cargo,” they said in a state­ment late on Thursday.</p>
    <p>There was no res­i­den­tial area within 2km of the freight sta­tion where the con­sign­ment has been stored, they added.</p>
    <p>Am­mo­nium ni­trate is used to make fer­tilis­ers and ex­plo­sives, mainly used by the quar­ry­ing in­dus­try in In­dia.</p>
    <p>The con­sign­ment was im­ported in 2015 by Amman Chem­i­cals, a com­pany based in Tamil Nadu state, and was con­fis­cated on ar­rival due to an al­leged vi­o­la­tion of im­port rules, a Cus­toms of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>“The com­pany has been served a show-cause no­tice and a case was booked,” the of­fi­cial added.</p>
    <p>Mr P. Ku­mare­san, a part­ner at Amman Chem­i­cals, de­clined to com­ment on the con­sign­ment.</p>
