    <p>LON­DON • Wat­ford goal­keeper Ben Fos­ter ad­mit­ted con­fi­dence at Vicarage Road is “crazy low” as they slipped into the rel­e­ga­tion zone with one game of the Premier League sea­son to go after be­ing thrashed 4-0 at home by Manch­ester City on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>A change of man­age­ment did lit­tle good after Wat­ford be­came the first Premier League team to sack three man­agers in a sea­son when Nigel Pear­son de­parted on Sun­day, while City bounced back from their week­end dis­ap­point­ment of los­ing an FA Cup semi-fi­nal to Arse­nal.</p>
    <p>Ra­heem Ster­ling scored twice be­fore Phil Fo­den and Aymeric La­porte rounded off a com­pre­hen­sive City win. It was the first time this sea­son Pep Guardi­ola’s men won a fourth straight league game.</p>
    <p>The heavy de­feat could send 18th-placed Wat­ford down come the fi­nal day of the sea­son on Sun­day as they dropped into the bot­tom three on goal dif­fer­ence after As­ton Villa beat Arse­nal 1-0.</p>
    <p>Wat­ford travel to Arse­nal at the week­end, while 17th-placed Villa take on West Ham, who are three points ahead but re­al­is­ti­cally safe due to a su­pe­rior goal dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think we helped our­selves, I don’t think we did enough to do any­thing but what the re­sult sug­gested to be hon­est,” said Fos­ter, who helped keep the score down with a string of saves.</p>
    <p>“The con­fi­dence is so crazy, crazy low. I don’t know why, but you get into a state of try­ing to min­imise as much dam­age as you can and it’s a dan­ger­ous way to do things.”</p>
    <p>City will end the sea­son in sec­ond place and they host al­ready-rel­e­gated Nor­wich on Sun­day. But Guardi­ola was pleased to get a re­ac­tion from the 2-0 loss to Arse­nal on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>“Wat­ford were play­ing for a big is­sue but we were much more ag­gres­sive in our senses to­day,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We had to avoid the game we played against Arse­nal.</p>
    <p>“But we need to know we’re far away from Liver­pool. This was the first time we’ve man­aged to win four in a row in the league.</p>
    <p>“Two sea­sons ago, we man­aged 18, last sea­son 14. This shows how poor the con­sis­tency has been this sea­son.”</p>
    <p>City have now beaten Wat­ford by a com­bined score of 18-0 in their last three meet­ings after an 8-0 rout ear­lier in the sea­son and a 6-0 win in last sea­son’s FA Cup fi­nal.</p>
    <p>Hay­den Mullins took charge of the hosts and set up to frus­trate the vis­i­tors by de­fend­ing deep.</p>
    <p>But there was lit­tle doubt over the out­come fol­low­ing two firsthalf goals from Ster­ling, who has 19 Premier League goals this sea­son.</p>
    <p>Fo­den added the third be­fore La­porte was left com­pletely un­marked to head home Kevin de Bruyne’s free kick as the lat­ter moved to within one of Thierry Henry’s record of 20 Premier League as­sists in a sea­son.</p>
