    <p>“No ocean, no life.” Be­ing a Cousteau, this mes­sage was prac­ti­cally writ­ten into my DNA. And it’s one I’ve tried to share with the world through my many years of work as an en­vi­ron­men­tal ad­vo­cate.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, given the dire state of our oceans to­day, it’s clear that the mes­sage hasn’t got­ten through to most peo­ple.</p>
    <p>As we re­flect on this year – one of the most so­cially and sci­en­tif­i­cally dif­fi­cult years in re­cent mem­ory – and look for ways to move for­ward, it’s cru­cial that we un­der­stand this sim­ple fact: With­out a healthy ocean, we will not have a healthy fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Many of us have ex­pe­ri­enced the magic and beauty of the ocean. Yet its vi­tal con­nec­tion to our daily lives – the ways in which it sup­plies the oxy­gen we breathe and nour­ishes the crops we eat – re­mains far less un­der­stood.</p>
    <p>I’ve had the chal­lenge – and the priv­i­lege – of spend­ing 31 con­tin­u­ous days liv­ing in an un­der­wa­ter habi­tat, which has given me a unique per­spec­tive on the in­trin­sic value of the ocean as our pri­mary life sup­port sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The truth, to para­phrase Arthur C. Clarke, is that our planet would more ap­pro­pri­ately be called Ocean, not Earth. With­out our wa­ter, Earth would be just one of bil­lions of life­less rocks float­ing in the inky-black void of space.</p>
    <p>How can we change our per­spec­tive on the ocean as it re­lates to our planet? We can start by heed­ing the lessons of 2020.</p>
    <p>While the coro­n­avirus has caused great suf­fer­ing and tragedy, it has also shed light on some of the in­vis­i­ble struc­tures that un­der­pin our daily lives, from racial in­jus­tice to the ex­treme dis­par­i­ties in wealth that bur­den our com­mu­ni­ties. While these re­al­i­ties have al­ways been plain to some, it took the seis­mic shifts cre­ated by the pan­demic for many of us to wake up to them.</p>
    <p>THE BEAUTY AND THE HOR­ROR</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has also served to re­mind us of the beauty of na­ture.</p>
    <p>As Covid-19 spread across the globe in the spring, prompt­ing na­tion upon na­tion to im­pose strict lockdown mea­sures, the nat­u­ral world briefly re­asserted it­self: Cloudy Vene­tian canals grew clearer. The smog dis­si­pated over the Hol­ly­wood Hills. Cars van­ished from the roads, lead­ing to a sig­nif­i­cant, though tem­po­rary, drop in car­bon diox­ide emis­sions.</p>
    <p>These de­vel­op­ments were en­cour­ag­ing, sug­gest­ing that dra­matic change was pos­si­ble, and that there was hope for a greener fu­ture after all.</p>
    <p>Yet, as the pan­demic has con­tin­ued, it has also caused the use of dis­pos­able plas­tics to sky­rocket. Gro­cery bags and la­tex gloves fill our trash bins. Dis­carded face masks flow down the drains of our city streets and into our wa­ter­ways, po­ten­tially harm­ing sea life. Whether we re­alise it or not, dis­carded plas­tics are chok­ing the life out of our ecosys­tem.</p>
    <p>Both en­vi­ron­men­tal pol­lu­tion and the pan­demic share an un­nerv­ing trait: The mech­a­nisms and pro­cesses that un­der­lie them re­main largely in­vis­i­ble to the naked eye. We can’t see the mi­croplas­tic con­tam­i­nants we may be in­gest­ing when we eat food from the sea to­day, just like we can’t see the re­s­pi­ra­tory droplets of the coro­n­avirus as they pass from per­son to per­son. This fact can make these threats feel par­tic­u­larly over­whelm­ing.</p>
    <p>But we aren’t alone in these fights. None of us are nat­u­rally im­mune to the virus, or to the ef­fects of pol­lu­tion and cli­mate change. And we can cre­ate real change if we act col­lec­tively.</p>
    <p>Seem­ingly small, ev­ery­day ac­tions can help com­bat both pol­lu­tion and the virus.</p>
    <p>A CLOSED-LOOP SYS­TEM</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, wear­ing a wash­able and re­us­able mask is an easy way to pro­tect your neigh­bour’s health and en­sure that less plas­tic ends up in the ocean. To pro­tect our wa­ter­ways fur­ther, we should avoid buy­ing con­sumer goods wrapped in plas­tic, which will, in turn, lower the de­mand for such prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>We live in a closed-loop sys­tem. We can’t ac­tu­ally throw things “away”. The plas­tic we toss in the garbage of­ten just ends up in­side the bod­ies of ma­rine an­i­mals, be­fore find­ing its way back in­side of us.</p>
    <p>Like my grand­fa­ther, Jac­ques-Yves Cousteau, I be­lieve that we pro­tect what we love, and love what we un­der­stand. We have the abil­ity to dic­tate the mag­ni­tude of the coro­n­avirus and cli­mate crises if we can sim­ply ab­sorb the lessons of sci­ence, in­clud­ing the hard truth that dev­as­ta­tion awaits if we act too late.</p>
    <p>We must learn that to be on na­ture’s side is to be on hu­man­ity’s side.</p>
    <p>Now, more than ever, we need hope. But we can’t just wait around for it; we have to cre­ate it.</p>
    <p>PRO­JECT PROTEUS</p>
    <p>One way I’m build­ing to­wards a more hope­ful fu­ture – and con­tribut­ing to the ef­fort to find solutions to the press­ing prob­lems that con­front us – is through the cre­ation of Proteus, in­tended to be the world’s most ad­vanced un­der­wa­ter re­search sta­tion and habi­tat.</p>
    <p>The first in a pro­jected net­work of Proteus habi­tats will be lo­cated 18m be­low the sur­face of the Caribbean Sea off the is­land of Cu­ra­cao, and will serve, es­sen­tially, as an in­ter­na­tional space sta­tion for ocean ex­plo­ration, al­low­ing sci­en­tists and ob­servers from around the world to live un­der the sea for weeks or po­ten­tially months on end.</p>
    <p>As they do, they’ll un­lock more of the ocean’s se­crets. With only roughly 5 per cent of the Earth’s oceans ex­plored thus far, there is an ur­gent need, and an ideal op­por­tu­nity, to bet­ter un­der­stand how the ocean af­fects cli­mate change, and what it can teach us about clean en­ergy and food sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>And, of course, there’s the ocean’s as­ton­ish­ing bio­di­ver­sity. What med­i­cal break­throughs might we stum­ble upon through the dis­cov­ery of new species?</p>
    <p>The first Proteus habi­tat, slated for com­ple­tion in 2023, will fea­ture a video pro­duc­tion stu­dio, in­tended to al­low mil­lions of peo­ple around the globe a chance to ex­pe­ri­ence the won­ders of life un­der the sea. Through Proteus, more will come to un­der­stand the power of our sim­ple mes­sage: No ocean, no life.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery day that we fail to find solutions to the cli­mate cri­sis is a day that we come closer to los­ing an­other species to the rav­ages of a warm­ing planet. Cli­mate change isn’t go­ing to slow down so that our own pri­or­i­ties can catch up.</p>
    <p>Yet I have hope. A re­search sta­tion like Proteus is es­sen­tial to pro­tect­ing our wa­ters – and to as­sur­ing our fu­ture: I be­lieve the ma­rine en­vi­ron­ment may well con­tain nat­u­ral com­pounds that could help ease this pan­demic or the next one.</p>
    <p>His­tor­i­cally, in times of ex­treme cri­sis, hu­man­ity has come to­gether to share ideas, put in place bold solutions and find new ways to sur­vive.</p>
    <p>Now is the time for sim­i­lar ac­tion. As we look to next year and be­yond, we must fi­nally take the steps nec­es­sary to pro­tect our oceans, re­ly­ing on sci­ence and the power of hu­man in­ge­nu­ity. Our lives de­pend on it.</p>
