    <p>Re­tired teacher Madam Saro­jini Koru said she is un­sure if she will cast her vote in a by-elec­tion in Slim, a ru­ral district in Malaysia’s Perak state, on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>“I have not de­cided. I am not in­ter­ested in pol­i­tics,” the 69-year-old told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>In an­other part of Slim con­stituency, Mr Kent Tan, 23, said he is too busy run­ning a cell­phone shop to reg­is­ter as a voter, let alone go down to the polling sta­tion to vote. “I don’t have time, I don’t even read the news,” he said, adding that he had never heard of Pe­juang, a party newly-formed by for­mer premier Tun Dr Ma­hathir Mo­hamad.</p>
    <p>The new party, Parti Pe­juang Tanah Air (Fight­ers of the Na­tion Party), is field­ing its can­di­date for the first time, with Dr Ma­hathir slated to ad­dress a po­lit­i­cal rally here this evening.</p>
    <p>Sen­ti­ments from sev­eral vot­ers in the ward in the last two days re­vealed that some Malaysians are suf­fer­ing from voter fa­tigue or sim­ply un­in­ter­ested.</p>
    <p>The Slim by-elec­tion is the 12th since the 2018 gen­eral elec­tion, and was called fol­low­ing the death of its as­sem­bly­man from Umno. It is the sec­ond by-elec­tion since the coro­n­avirus pan­demic hit the coun­try hard in March, with the pre­vi­ous state polls held for the Chini ward in Pa­hang on July 4.</p>
    <p>Cam­paign­ing ap­peared to be lack­lus­tre com­pared with pre­vi­ous polls, with many meet-the-peo­ple pro­grammes and ral­lies see­ing low turnouts, par­tic­u­larly on week­days.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, the par­ties are re­stricted to gath­er­ings of fewer than 250 peo­ple for their ral­lies to meet health pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>“The cam­paign has been luke­warm, I don’t see ex­cite­ment on the ground. I think the vot­ers are suf­fer­ing from voter fa­tigue,” a law­maker from the op­po­si­tion Pakatan Hara­pan told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Umno is field­ing busi­ness­man Mohd Zaidi Aziz, 43, in the three­way con­test. It is con­test­ing un­der the blue Barisan Na­sional (BN) flag. Pe­juang is rep­re­sented by Is­lamic lawyer Amir Kusyairi Mo­hamad Tanusi, 38. He is stand­ing as an in­de­pen­dent as the party’s reg­is­tra­tion has yet to be ap­proved. The third can­di­date, teacher S. San­tha­rasekaran, 44, is also an in­de­pen­dent.</p>
    <p>With politi­cians from both sides of the po­lit­i­cal di­vide en­gaged in con­stant bick­er­ing, some vot­ers felt that their needs have been cast aside.</p>
    <p>In the Slim ward, res­i­dents say that the fre­quency of floods over the last 50 years is a ma­jor com­plaint which has not been re­solved.</p>
    <p>Madam Koru, the re­tired teacher, is fed up that her home is of­ten del­uged with floods, some­times with wa­ter lev­els close to a me­tre high.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment has never solved the prob­lem,” she said, show­ing how the fridge in her pre-war home in Tro­lak Pekan is placed on stilts be­cause of the reg­u­lar floods.</p>
    <p>Hous­ing woes are an­other grouse.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral land set­tlers un­der the gov­ern­ment’s Felda farm­ing scheme com­plain that they have yet to re­ceive af­ford­able homes promised to their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“Un­til now, I have not seen my house, it’s all just empty prom­ises,” said sec­ond-gen­er­a­tion Felda set­tler Anuar Sidek Za­karia, 53.</p>
    <p>He also com­plained about for­mer premier Na­jib Razak, who came to cam­paign for Umno.</p>
    <p>“Felda started un­der BN, and it will die un­der BN be­cause of Na­jib. He is a con­victed felon. The court has found him guilty. I don’t know why he is walk­ing around freely.”</p>
    <p>The Slim seat’s 23,094 vot­ers are 75 per cent Malay, 13 per cent In­dian, and 10 per cent Chi­nese. The re­main­der com­prise other eth­nic­i­ties, in­clud­ing the Orang Asli abo­rig­ines.</p>
