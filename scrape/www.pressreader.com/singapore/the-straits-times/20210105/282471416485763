    <p>Manch­ester United’s 2-1 win over As­ton Villa has set the stage for a highly-an­tic­i­pated clash with tra­di­tional ri­vals Liver­pool at An­field on Jan 17, with the ti­tle race look­ing set to be the clos­est in years.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing suf­fered false dawns un­der three man­agers since they won their last league ti­tle in 2013 in Alex Fer­gu­son’s fi­nal sea­son, United now have an iden­tity un­der Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer.</p>
    <p>They are un­beaten in 10 league matches and even if the Nor­we­gian is do­ing his best to play down their ti­tle am­bi­tions, he knows that in this strangest of sea­sons, United are in the mix.</p>
    <p>STAGE SET FOR HIGHOCTANE RED CLASH 2</p>
    <p>SON AND KANE CAN’T DO IT ALL FOR SPURS</p>
    <p>If Tot­ten­ham are to mount a sus­tained chal­lenge for the ti­tle, they must stop be­ing so re­liant on Son He­ung-min and Harry Kane.</p>
    <p>Both scored over the week­end against Leeds to end a run of four league games with­out a win and the pair al­ready have 22 league goals be­tween them this sea­son.</p>
    <p>With Spurs hav­ing scored 29 over­all in the league, they need to spread the goals around if they are to end a top-flight drought dat­ing back to 1960-61.</p>

    <p>NO NEW MAN­AGE­RIAL BOUNCE FOR BAG­GIES</p>
    <p>West Bromwich Al­bion’s 1-1 draw with Liver­pool last month is be­gin­ning to look like the ex­cep­tion that proves the rule.</p>
    <p>Since then, they have suf­fered two hor­ri­ble home de­feats by Leeds (0-5) and Arse­nal (0-4) and rel­e­ga­tion bat­tle spe­cial­ist Sam Allardyce looks as though he might have taken on a chal­lenge that is too big even for him.</p>
    <p>West Brom have con­ceded 13 goals and picked up only one point in Allardyce’s four games in charge and he will have to shore up his de­fence if they are to have any hope.</p>
