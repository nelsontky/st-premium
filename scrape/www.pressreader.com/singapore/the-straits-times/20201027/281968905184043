    <p>An eight-year-old girl who is in in­ten­sive care af­ter be­ing flung out of a van dur­ing an ac­ci­dent in Wood­lands last Fri­day is still in a coma, her fa­ther told the me­dia on Sun­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>The 45-year-old man, who wanted to be known only as Mr Tan, told Chi­nese-lan­guage news­pa­pers Shin Min Daily News and Lianhe Wan­bao that the next one to two days will be crit­i­cal in his daugh­ter’s re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>The girl was one of four peo­ple taken to hospi­tal af­ter an ac­ci­dent in­volv­ing a van and a red Audi car in Wood­lands Av­enue 12 to­wards Sele­tar Ex­press­way last Fri­day evening.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said they were alerted to the in­ci­dent at about 8.10pm, and three van pas­sen­gers, aged be­tween eight and 27 years old, and a 32-year-old male car pas­sen­ger were con­scious when taken to Khoo Teck Puat Hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>The van driver, a 56-year-old man, was ar­rested for dan­ger­ous driv­ing caus­ing hurt. Po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>In-car cam­era footage from an­other car show­ing the crash and videos from other driv­ers of its af­ter­math were posted on so­cial me­dia over the week­end.</p>
    <p>The videos show the red Audi trav­el­ling on the right of the two-lane road be­fore it col­lides with the van, which is mak­ing a U-turn.</p>
    <p>The im­pact sends both ve­hi­cles spin­ning and at least two peo­ple are seen be­ing flung out of the van, which mounts a kerb.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said his daugh­ter needed emer­gency surgery at 4am af­ter she was hos­pi­talised, and she was later trans­ferred to the in­ten­sive care unit at KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>Apart from her head in­jury, the girl also frac­tured both her legs, with the wound on her right leg so deep that the bone was ex­posed.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day morn­ing, Mr Tan told Wan­bao that while he was sad, he took time out to ful­fil his tem­ple du­ties and bought break­fast home to eat with his younger daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>He said friends and fam­ily have been send­ing him mes­sages of en­cour­age­ment as well.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan also re­vealed that the van driver who was ar­rested is his brother-in-law, and his niece, 27, and nephew, 23, were also hurt in the crash.</p>
    <p>The nephew needed surgery as he had a rup­tured spleen and fa­cial in­juries, but is now con­scious and ex­pected to be moved to a reg­u­lar ward.</p>
    <p>The niece, who was in the front pas­sen­ger seat, is in sta­ble con­di­tion and ex­pected to be dis­charged on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan’s six-year-old daugh­ter was also in the van dur­ing the ac­ci­dent. She is un­hurt and now stay­ing with her aunt.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan told Wan­bao that his brother-in-law and his fam­ily would typ­i­cally pick up his two girls from school and have din­ner. At the time of the ac­ci­dent, they had just eaten and were on their way to meet him.</p>
    <p>He said that his brother-in-law, who is out on bail, has been con­stantly ask­ing about his daugh­ter’s con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Audi driver has not con­tacted Mr Tan or his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Tan: “No one wanted this ac­ci­dent to hap­pen and my brother-in-law’s chil­dren were also in­jured.</p>
    <p>“I don’t blame him at all.”</p>
