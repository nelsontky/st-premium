    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Biden will be a cri­sis pres­i­dent from Day One – deal­ing with a democ­racy wounded and shaken, a ru­n­away pan­demic and food-bank lines in a strug­gling econ­omy. All this in an at­mos­phere of tur­bocharged po­lit­i­cal and cul­tural trib­al­ism.</p>
    <p>“You don’t be­long here,” an African-Amer­i­can woman yelled at Don­ald Trump sup­port­ers on Dec 12 in down­town Wash­ing­ton. On the same day, at the State Capi­tol in At­lanta, Georgia, dozens of pro-Trump white mili­tia marched, armed to the teeth.</p>
    <p>One is an al­most ev­ery­day ex­am­ple, the sec­ond an ex­treme but not rare one, of the ten­sions that many fear – if ig­nited by some un­fore­seen event or ac­ci­dent – could tear Amer­ica apart.</p>
    <p>Abroad, Amer­ica’s im­age has plunged. A 13-na­tion Pew Re­search Cen­tre sur­vey re­leased in Septem­ber found: “In sev­eral coun­tries, the share of the pub­lic with a favourable view of the US is as low as it has been at any point since the cen­tre be­gan polling on this topic nearly two decades ago.”</p>
    <p>It is both plau­si­ble and se­duc­tive to con­clude that this all adds up to a United States in flail­ing de­cline.</p>
    <p>“The United States could de­cline into a de-in­dus­tri­alised, English-speak­ing ver­sion of a Latin Amer­i­can repub­lic,” warned Pro­fes­sor Michael Lind of the Lyn­don B. Johnson School of Pub­lic Af­fairs at the Univer­sity of Texas in Austin, in May.</p>
    <p>And an­other, more re­cent, warn­ing came from Amer­i­can stud­ies pro­fes­sor Glenn Altschuler of Cor­nell Univer­sity: “The per­sis­tence of Repub­li­can en­ablers in the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives and the Se­nate... keep­ing alive the at­tempt to dele­git­imise the pres­i­dency of Joe Biden is a sig­nif­i­cant con­cern for Amer­i­can democ­racy at its core.”</p>
    <p>This comes as the US is in a deep­en­ing ri­valry with a new peer com­peti­tor – China.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the fa­tal­ism of “de­clin­ism” – the be­lief that the US is slid­ing ir­re­versibly from its pre-em­i­nent sta­tus – is mis­guided, for­mer top diplo­mat Kurt Camp­bell and Dr Rush Doshi, di­rec­tor of the Brook­ings In­sti­tu­tion’s China Strat­egy Ini­tia­tive, con­tend in an ar­ti­cle in For­eign Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>The US still has a young pop­u­la­tion, fi­nan­cial dom­i­nance, abun­dant re­sources, peace­ful bor­ders, strong al­liances and an in­no­va­tive econ­omy, they note.</p>
    <p>Mr Camp­bell is fa­mil­iar in South-east Asia from the Barack Obama years when he was as­sis­tant sec­re­tary of state for East Asia and Pa­cific Af­fairs. Dr Doshi is also a fel­low at Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“The ar­rival of an ex­ter­nal com­peti­tor has of­ten pushed the US to be­come its best self; han­dled ju­di­ciously, it can once again,” they write.</p>
    <p>GO­ING TOO FAR</p>
    <p>The key word may be “ju­di­ciously”. Cer­tainly, the one is­sue that does ap­pear to unite peo­ple across the po­lit­i­cal spec­trum is China. But go­ing too far in ral­ly­ing around ri­valry with China is fraught with risk.</p>
    <p>“If a cold war with China be­comes the or­gan­is­ing prin­ci­ple for US for­eign pol­icy in this cen­tury, we will have more end­less wars, not less,” con­tends Dr Trita Parsi, co-founder of the Quincy In­sti­tute for Re­spon­si­ble State­craft, a think-tank.</p>
    <p>Congress churn­ing out leg­is­la­tion aimed at China, and more specif­i­cally, the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party, is one thing; wide, blind anti-Chi­nese sen­ti­ment stoked by China hawks and am­pli­fied by right-wing and so­cial me­dia is quite an­other.</p>
    <p>China does present a unique and com­plex chal­lenge to a power that is in­tent on re­main­ing the sole global su­per­power. But to­day’s world is al­ready mul­ti­po­lar. China is far more in­te­grated glob­ally than, for ex­am­ple, the for­mer Soviet Union ever was.</p>
    <p>Plung­ing into a new cold war with China risks hurt­ing both coun­tries. Eco­nomic de­cou­pling is un­re­al­is­tic. And from the soya bean farms of Iowa to the lob­ster coast of Maine, many Amer­i­cans need China to buy more, not less; the is­sue is one of fair trade, not no trade.</p>
    <p>For the US, it may be best to first re­build and repur­pose at home af­ter four years of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion. This, com­bined with a killer pan­demic and a hotly con­tested elec­tion, has ex­ac­er­bated in­ter­nal ten­sions to the point that the US could be de­scribed as a tin­der­box.</p>
    <p>There is ev­ery in­di­ca­tion the Pres­i­dent-elect un­der­stands that – notwith­stand­ing the lack of cer­tainty that he can ac­tu­ally ac­com­plish it; the odds are for­mi­da­ble.</p>
    <p>ALLURE OF EX­TER­NAL EN­EMY</p>
    <p>Mr Biden has in­her­ited a strong suite of mea­sures against China. Tak­ing that fur­ther, into a new cold war, may be al­lur­ing to China hawks and in­fuse Amer­ica with a sense of pur­pose. An ex­ter­nal en­emy is al­ways con­ve­nient to dis­tract from do­mes­tic trou­bles.</p>
    <p>In the minds of China hawks, China is that – an en­emy. But it would be also a dan­ger­ous flir­ta­tion with the “Thucy­dides trap” de­scribed by Har­vard pro­fes­sor Gra­ham Al­li­son in 2015.</p>
    <p>The phrase, whose ori­gins go back to Greek his­to­rian</p>
    <p>Thucy­dides, refers to the dan­gers when a ris­ing power ri­vals a rul­ing power. In 12 of 16 cases over the past 500 years, the re­sult has been war. Prof Al­li­son sees China as a gen­uine Thucy­didean ri­val to the US, a power whose rise is dis­plac­ing the lat­ter.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion is whether the US can co­ex­ist with China. The al­ter­na­tive is to co-de­struct.</p>
    <p>The best op­tion may be a cold de­tente, held in place by both a bal­ance of ter­ror – the cost of war be­ing un­ac­cept­ably high – and by the need for hu­man­ity to work col­lec­tively on transna­tional and ex­is­ten­tial is­sues, from or­gan­ised crime and dis­as­ters to cli­mate change, pol­lu­tion and global health.</p>
    <p>The in­com­ing Biden ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fers this op­por­tu­nity for the two pow­ers.</p>
    <p>It was Abra­ham Lin­coln who fa­mously said: “A house di­vided against it­self can­not stand.”</p>
    <p>Those words are ap­pli­ca­ble not only to the US to­day, but the earth it­self, and hu­man­ity’s fu­ture on it.</p>
