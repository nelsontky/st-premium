    <p>Step into the boots of a sol­dier and take down your “en­e­mies” in a for­est in Mandai, or solve jig­saw puz­zles of pic­tures re­lated to the army.</p>
    <p>Th­ese games are part of the ac­tiv­i­ties at the Sin­ga­pore Army’s first vir­tual ex­hi­bi­tion, launched yes­ter­day to com­mem­o­rate its 55th year since the pass­ing of the Sin­ga­pore Army Bill on Dec 23, 1965.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors can learn more about the army’s his­tory, weapons and ve­hi­cles at the Army 55 Vir­tual Ex­hi­bi­tion, which is ac­ces­si­ble on lap­tops or smart­phones on­line till Dec 13.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for De­fence Heng Chee How, who launched the ex­hi­bi­tion, said the army has come a long way from its mod­est be­gin­nings, from two in­fantry bat­tal­ions when Sin­ga­pore be­came in­de­pen­dent to the third-gen­er­a­tion, net­worked force of to­day.</p>
    <p>“Over the past 55 years, our army has given strength and con­fi­dence to Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore­ans, es­pe­cially in times of cri­sis. This en­dur­ing com­mit­ment was ex­em­pli­fied most re­cently in our na­tional fight against Covid-19,” he said in a pre-recorded mes­sage.</p>
    <p>He said more than 5,000 army per­son­nel stepped for­ward to con­trib­ute amid the pan­demic, in ar­eas such as con­tact trac­ing, tak­ing care of mi­grant work­ers and supporting the health­care sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The army is strong be­cause of the com­mit­ment of its sol­diers, as well as pub­lic sup­port for na­tional ser­vice and na­tional de­fence, he said.</p>
    <p>The theme for the army’s 55th an­niver­sary cel­e­bra­tions, “Our Army Fam­ily”, marks the strong bonds be­tween ser­vice­men, as well as how the ci­ti­zen army thrives on pub­lic and fam­ily sup­port, he said.</p>
    <p>“When we en­list a sol­dier, we en­list his whole fam­ily. When our op­er­a­tionally ready na­tional ser­vice­men turn up for ICT (in-camp train­ing), they do so with the un­der­stand­ing of their fam­i­lies and em­ploy­ers,” he said, adding that the ex­hi­bi­tion will hon­our both the sol­diers and those who sup­port them.</p>
    <p>The ex­hi­bi­tion, set in a vir­tual en­vi­ron­ment in the shape of a house, fea­tures seven zones. Vis­i­tors can click on the dif­fer­ent zones – such as the Ma­rina Bay float­ing plat­form – to ex­plore the videos, games and in­for­ma­tion pan­els.</p>
    <p>The his­tory zone, for in­stance, re­counts the army’s key mile­stones, such as its first over­seas hu­man­i­tar­ian as­sis­tance and dis­as­ter relief op­er­a­tion, Ops Palm, in 1970.</p>
    <p>There are also videos that will pre­miere mostly at 3pm on week­ends or 8pm on week­days, with con­tent such as a fit­ness chal­lenge in­volv­ing dif­fer­ent army for­ma­tions, work­out ses­sions, and “Ask Me Any­thing” shows fea­tur­ing sol­diers shar­ing their ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>Ser­vice­men and their fam­i­lies are also en­cour­aged to take part in a vir­tual run and com­plete 5.5km each, with the aim of clock­ing a to­tal of 55,000km from Dec 1 to 13.</p>
    <p>Colonel Dean Yik, chair­man of the or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee for the vir­tual ex­hi­bi­tion, said it was meant to thank sol­diers past and present for their com­mit­ment, ded­i­ca­tion and sac­ri­fice, as well as to show ap­pre­ci­a­tion for their fam­i­lies and Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edg­ing that fam­i­lies en­joyed the phys­i­cal as­pect of past ex­hi­bi­tions, where they got to see mil­i­tary ve­hi­cles up close, Col Yik said the vir­tual ex­hi­bi­tion has been de­signed to be as in­ter­ac­tive as pos­si­ble, with el­e­ments such as games.</p>
    <p>“We know you can’t touch and feel the plat­forms, but the flip side is that with this for­mat of the ex­hi­bi­tion, you get to ex­pe­ri­ence more plat­forms – 44 of them.”</p>
