    <p>•</p>
    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES As vi­o­lence at the US Capi­tol un­der­lined deep di­vi­sions in Amer­ica on Wed­nes­day, Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) play­ers said the in­ci­dent helped re­new their com­mit­ment to fight racial in­jus­tice.</p>
    <p>Bos­ton Celtics and Mi­ami Heat play­ers knelt dur­ing the na­tional an­them be­fore their game in Mi­ami on Wed­nes­day, hours af­ter sup­port­ers of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump stormed the Capi­tol as leg­is­la­tors met to cer­tify Joe Bi­den’s vic­tory in the Novem­ber elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The play­ers is­sued a joint state­ment re­fer­ring not only to the chaotic events in Wash­ing­ton but also to the de­ci­sion on Tues­day by pros­e­cu­tors in Wis­con­sin not to charge the white po­lice of­fi­cer who shot and paral­ysed black man Ja­cob Blake in Kenosha, Wis­con­sin last Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Protests of Blake’s shoot­ing brought the NBA to a stand­still for three days in Au­gust in a protest of racial in­jus­tice that soon spread across an ar­ray of sports.</p>
    <p>“2021 is a new year, but some things have not changed,” the Celtics and Heat play­ers said in their state­ment.</p>
    <p>“We play tonight’s game with a heavy heart af­ter yes­ter­day’s de­ci­sion in Kenosha and know­ing that pro­test­ers in our na­tion’s cap­i­tal are treated dif­fer­ently by po­lit­i­cal lead­ers de­pend­ing on what side of cer­tain is­sues they are on.</p>
    <p>“The dras­tic dif­fer­ence between the way pro­test­ers this past spring and sum­mer were treated and the en­cour­age­ment given to to­day’s pro­test­ers who acted il­le­gally just shows how much more work we have to do.</p>
    <p>“We have de­cided to play tonight’s game to try to bring joy into peo­ple’s lives.”</p>
    <p>Both teams also stressed the need to “not for­get the in­jus­tice in our so­ci­ety” and that they will con­tinue to use their voices and their plat­form to high­light th­ese is­sues and do their best “to work for a more equal and just Amer­ica”.</p>
    <p>On the court, the game – one of 11 on the night that went ahead as sched­uled – was a thrilling af­fair. Rookie guard Pay­ton Pritchard scored on a put­back with twotenths of a sec­ond left to give the Celtics a 107-105 win.</p>
    <p>In Philadel­phia, 76ers coach Doc Rivers was blunt in his as­sess­ment of the scene at the Capi­tol as his team beat the Wash­ing­ton Wizards 141-136.</p>
    <p>“It’s pretty dis­turb­ing and sad,” he said. “I keep hear­ing, ‘This is an at­tack on democ­racy’. It’s not. Democ­racy will pre­vail. It al­ways does. It shows a lot though. I’ll say it be­cause I don’t think a lot of peo­ple want to – could you imag­ine to­day if those were all black peo­ple storm­ing into the Capi­tol and what would’ve hap­pened?</p>
    <p>“It’s a sad day in a lot of ways. But it’s a part of what we are and so we have to solve it.”</p>
    <p>In Mil­wau­kee, the Bucks and the Detroit Pis­tons both took turnovers on their first pos­ses­sions dur­ing the hosts’ 130-115 win.</p>
    <p>The Bucks won the open­ing tipoff and NBA Most Valu­able Player Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo sim­ply held the ball as all the play­ers took a knee. On the en­su­ing Detroit pos­ses­sion, Pis­tons star Blake Grif­fin held the ball and all 10 play­ers on court took a knee again.</p>
    <p>Golden State War­riors coach Steve Kerr ad­mit­ted that it was hard to con­cen­trate on bas­ket­ball.</p>
    <p>“I started the day think­ing about how we were go­ing to guard Lou Wil­liams without foul­ing him,” he said of the game against the Los An­ge­les Clip­pers which they lost 108-101. “Sud­denly that didn’t seem quite as im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>“Just a bizarre scene, but a pretty clear re­minder that the truth mat­ters. A le­git­i­mate elec­tion is sud­denly ques­tioned by mil­lions of peo­ple, in­clud­ing many of the peo­ple who are lead­ing our coun­try in gov­ern­ment, be­cause we’ve de­cided to – over the last few years – al­low lies to be told. So, this is who we are. You reap what you sow.”</p>
    <p>NEW YEAR, OLD WAYS</p>
    <p>2021 is a new year, but some things have not changed. We play tonight’s game with a heavy ’’ heart...</p>
    <p>CELTICS AND HEAT PLAY­ERS</p>
    <p>NEW DAY, NEW PER­SPEC­TIVE</p>
    <p>I started the day think­ing about how we were go­ing to guard Lou Wil­liams without foul­ing him. Sud­denly that didn’t seem quite as ’’ im­por­tant.</p>
