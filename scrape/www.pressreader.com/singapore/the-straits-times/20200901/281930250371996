    <p>SYD­NEY • Aus­tralia’s Par­lia­ment is set to probe al­leged for­eign in­ter­fer­ence at pub­lic uni­ver­si­ties, a govern­ment min­is­ter said yes­ter­day, as con­cerns grow about Chi­nese in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>A pro­posed in­quiry by the se­cu­rity and in­tel­li­gence com­mit­tee fol­lows a se­ries of con­tro­ver­sies over China’s clout on Aus­tralian cam­puses, rang­ing from hacks of univer­sity data to ques­tion­able fi­nan­cial do­na­tions and in­tim­i­da­tion of Bei­jing’s crit­ics.</p>
    <p>Con­cerns have also been raised about the na­ture of re­search links be­tween aca­demics and sci­en­tists in the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Mr Alan Tudge, the min­is­ter for pop­u­la­tion and cities, told Sky News the mooted in­quiry was the lat­est govern­ment bid to tackle spi­ralling for­eign in­ter­fer­ence now at “lev­els not seen since World War II”.</p>
    <p>The move comes af­ter Can­berra an­nounced last week that it was seek­ing new pow­ers to scrap deals be­tween the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties and for­eign coun­tries that threaten the na­tional in­ter­est – sweep­ing pow­ers that would ex­tend to uni­ver­si­ties.</p>
    <p>It also comes less than a year af­ter Aus­tralia an­nounced new guide­lines for uni­ver­si­ties over re­search col­lab­o­ra­tion, cy­ber se­cu­rity, and in­ter­na­tional part­ner­ships.</p>
    <p>Mr Tudge said the in­quiry would “go fur­ther” than pre­vi­ous probes into al­leged for­eign in­ter­fer­ence. “We need to be as­sured and the pub­lic need to be as­sured that there isn’t that for­eign in­ter­fer­ence in our uni­ver­si­ties sec­tor,” he said.</p>
    <p>He did not say if the probe was aimed at China.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian news­pa­per re­ported that Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter Peter Dut­ton had out­lined the terms of ref­er­ence for the in­quiry in a let­ter on Sun­day to com­mit­tee head An­drew Hastie, a govern­ment par­lia­men­tar­ian and out­spo­ken China critic.</p>
    <p>Ad­vis­ers to Mr Dut­ton did not re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>The univer­sity guide­lines an­nounced in Novem­ber push pub­lic in­sti­tu­tions to en­hance cy­ber-se­cu­rity sys­tems, un­der­take due dili­gence be­fore sign­ing part­ner­ships with over­seas or­gan­i­sa­tions, and train staff to recog­nise for­eign in­flu­ence at­tempts.</p>
    <p>Aca­demics have been urged to be wary of shar­ing knowl­edge on sen­si­tive top­ics and dis­cern how joint re­search with in­ter­na­tional schol­ars could po­ten­tially be mis­used.</p>
    <p>Schools and govern­ment of­fi­cials also com­mit­ted to more in­ten­sive con­sul­ta­tion to pro­tect Aus­tralia’s na­tional in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has re­peat­edly de­nied in­ter­fer­ing in Aus­tralian cam­pus life.</p>
    <p>China-Aus­tralia re­la­tions have reached a new ebb in re­cent months, with the two gov­ern­ments at log­ger­heads over trade and com­pe­ti­tion for in­flu­ence in the Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions spiked in April when Aus­tralia in­fu­ri­ated China by call­ing for an in­de­pen­dent probe into the ori­gins of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, which emerged in the Chi­nese city of Wuhan late last year.</p>
