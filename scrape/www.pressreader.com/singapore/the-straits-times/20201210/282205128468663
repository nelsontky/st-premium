    <p>A man caught on video ver­bally abus­ing a store su­per­vi­sor with vul­gar­i­ties and racist re­marks was fined $4,000 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mo­hamed Ali Ramly, 53, pleaded guilty to one count each of ha­rass­ment and wound­ing the su­per­vi­sor’s racial feel­ings, as well as a charge for fail­ing to wear a mask over his mouth and nose while out­side his home.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, the Sin­ga­porean left his res­i­dence on a bi­cy­cle on April 17, in­tend­ing to buy soya milk from nearby shops. He cy­cled to three shops in the area near Pi­o­neer Mall and Pi­o­neer MRT sta­tion but was turned away as he was not wear­ing a mask.</p>
    <p>Ali later went to the Li Li Cheng Min­i­mart at Block 651 Jurong West Street 61 at about 6pm that day.</p>
    <p>He picked up a car­ton of soya milk and at­tempted to pur­chase it from Chi­nese na­tional Wang Jian, 32, who was the cashier at the time.</p>
    <p>Ms Wang told him in bro­ken English that she was un­able to serve him as he was not wear­ing a mask.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments state that Ali be­came ag­i­tated and re­peat­edly ques­tioned her as to why he was de­nied ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Alarmed, Ms Wang started record­ing his ac­tions us­ing her mo­bile phone.</p>
    <p>Ali then shouted ob­scene words and made a vul­gar ges­ture at her with his hand.</p>
    <p>Ms Wang re­sponded by say­ing that she would up­load the footage she was record­ing onto so­cial me­dia plat­form Face­book.</p>
    <p>Ali replied that he had merely for­got­ten his mask and had only wanted to buy a sin­gle item.</p>
    <p>He sub­se­quently ut­tered sev­eral racist slurs, in­clud­ing at­tribut­ing the source of the Covid-19 pan­demic to the Chi­nese peo­ple, and made an­other vul­gar ges­ture at her again.</p>
    <p>A po­lice re­port was lodged the next day on April 18, af­ter a video clip of the in­ci­dent cir­cu­lated on­line.</p>
    <p>For mak­ing re­marks to wound the racial feel­ings of Ms Wang, Ali could have been jailed up to three years, fined, or both.</p>
    <p>He could also have been jailed up to six months, fined up to $5,000, or both, for his ha­rass­ment of­fence.</p>
    <p>For fail­ing to wear a mask over his nose and mouth when out­doors, he could have been jailed up to six months, fined up to $10,000, or both.</p>
    <p>He sub­se­quently ut­tered sev­eral racist slurs, in­clud­ing at­tribut­ing the source of the Covid-19 pan­demic to the Chi­nese peo­ple, and made an­other vul­gar ges­ture at her again.</p>
