    <p>A 55-year-old cargo of­fi­cer linked to a new clus­ter in the ma­rine sec­tor was among two com­mu­nity cases of the coro­n­avirus an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>There were also 26 im­ported cases con­firmed by the Min­istry of Health (MOH), tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,749.</p>
    <p>The cargo of­fi­cer is a Sin­ga­porean man who was on board bunker tanker NewOcean 6 from Dec 21 to Dec 23, and from Dec 28 to last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>He stayed at his home in Tah</p>
    <p>Ching Road be­tween Dec 23 and 28.</p>
    <p>MOH added that the cargo of­fi­cer as well as five newly con­firmed cases are linked to three pre­vi­ous cases, form­ing a new clus­ter.</p>
    <p>The man’s ear­lier tests from ros­tered rou­tine test­ing – the last be­ing on Dec 23 – had come back neg­a­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, he was placed on quar­an­tine af­ter be­ing iden­ti­fied as a close con­tact of an­other case, a 47-year-old ship crew mem­ber on the same ves­sel.</p>
    <p>The cargo of­fi­cer was con­veyed to a gov­ern­ment quar­an­tine fa­cil­ity last Satur­day, and tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>He was then taken to the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases.</p>
    <p>His sero­log­i­cal test re­sult has come back neg­a­tive, in­di­cat­ing that this is likely a cur­rent in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>All the re­main­ing crew mem­bers of the ves­sel have been placed on quar­an­tine since last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The other com­mu­nity case re­ported yes­ter­day is a 49-year-old In­dian na­tional who is here to visit his Sin­ga­porean spouse.</p>
    <p>The short-term visit pass holder ar­rived from In­dia on Dec 10 and served his stay-home no­tice at a ded­i­cated fa­cil­ity un­til Dec 24.</p>
    <p>He is asymp­to­matic and was de­tected when he took a Covid-19 pre­de­par­ture test on Sun­day be­fore his re­turn to In­dia. His re­sult came back pos­i­tive for Covid-19 on Mon­day and he was con­veyed to Mount Elizabeth Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>His sero­log­i­cal test re­sult has come back pos­i­tive, which in­di­cates a likely past in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>His case is cur­rently un­linked. The 26 im­ported cases com­prise two Sin­ga­pore­ans, two per­ma­nent res­i­dents, two work pass hold­ers and 20 work per­mit hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Cedele Bak­ery at Ve­loc­ity @ Novena Square and Ikea Alexan­dra were among places added to the list of lo­ca­tions vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were still in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has in­creased from one case in the week be­fore to 11 cases in the past week. The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also in­creased to four cases in the past week.</p>
