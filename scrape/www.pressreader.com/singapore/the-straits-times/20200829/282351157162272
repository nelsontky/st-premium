    <p>• Dell Tech­nolo­gies and Hewlett-Packard (HP) re­ported re­sults that topped Wall Street es­ti­mates, in a sign of strong demand for per­sonal com­put­ers from stu­dents and work­ers stuck at home dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Quar­terly rev­enue from Dell’s con­sumer de­vices jumped 18 per cent to US$3.2 bil­lion (S$4.4 bil­lion), while HP said it shipped a record 18 mil­lion PCs in its fis­cal third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Dell chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer Jeff Clarke said: “We saw strength in the gov­ern­ment sec­tor and in ed­u­ca­tion, with or­ders up 16 per cent and 24 per cent, re­spec­tively, as par­ents, teach­ers and school dis­tricts pre­pare for a new fron­tier in vir­tual learn­ing.”</p>
    <p>HP chief ex­ec­u­tive En­rique Lores said his com­pany’s note­books have proved es­sen­tial dur­ing the pan­demic. “Rather than hav­ing one PC per home, it’s hav­ing one PC per per­son,” he added.</p>
    <p>The spread of Covid-19 has forced mil­lions of peo­ple to stay home, giv­ing the PC in­dus­try an un­ex­pected boost. Af­ter sev­eral years of stag­na­tion, 72.3 mil­lion desk­top com­put­ers, note­books and work­sta­tions were shipped in the sec­ond quar­ter, up 11 per cent from a year ear­lier, ac­cord­ing to re­search firm IDC.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, Dell said sales were US$22.7 bil­lion in the pe­riod that ended July 31. An­a­lysts, on av­er­age, pro­jected US$22.5 bil­lion, ac­cord­ing to data com­piled by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>The hard­ware gi­ant re­ported earn­ings, ex­clud­ing some items, of US$1.92 a share, eas­ily beat­ing es­ti­mates of US$1.38 a share.</p>
    <p>Dell shares rose about 4 per cent in ex­tended trad­ing af­ter the re­sults.</p>
    <p>HP said sales came in at US$14.3 bil­lion in the pe­riod ended July 31.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts, on av­er­age, pro­jected US$13.3 bil­lion. Ex­clud­ing some items, profit was 49 US cents a share, beat­ing es­ti­mates of 43 US cents.</p>
    <p>The com­pany also pro­jected that profit in the fis­cal fourth quar­ter will be 50 US cents to 54 US cents a share.</p>
