    <p>SYD­NEY Aus­tralia ex­pects to re­ceive its first batches of a po­ten­tial Covid-19 vac­cine in Jan­uary, Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son said yes­ter­day, as the num­ber of new daily in­fec­tions in the coun­try’s virus hot spot fell to a 10-week low.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son said his gov­ern­ment has struck a deal with CSL to man­u­fac­ture two vac­cines – one de­vel­oped by ri­val As­traZeneca and Ox­ford Univer­sity, and an­other de­vel­oped in CSL’s own labs with the Univer­sity of Queens­land.</p>
    <p>“Aus­tralia needs some hope,” Mr Mor­ri­son told re­porters in Can­berra. “To­day, we take an­other sig­nif­i­cant step to pro­tect the health of Aus­tralians against the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Greg Hunt said sci­en­tists l ead­ing the de­vel­op­ment of both vac­cines have ad­vised that re­cent ev­i­dence sug­gests both will of­fer “multi-year pro­tec­tion”.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son said CSL is ex­pected to de­liver 3.8 mil­lion doses of the As­traZeneca vac­cine – which is un­der­go­ing late-stage clin­i­cal tri­als in Bri­tain, Brazil and South Africa – in Jan­uary and Fe­bru­ary next year.</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca’s can­di­date, AZD1222, is viewed as a front run­ner in the global race to de­liver an ef­fec­tive vac­cine to com­bat the coro­n­avirus. Aus­tralia had an­nounced in Au­gust that it planned to buy AZD1222, along with an agree­ment of in­tent from CSL to man­u­fac­ture it. That plan was thrown into some doubt when CSL an­nounced soon af­ter that it would pri­ori­tise the man­u­fac­ture of its own vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son’s an­nounce­ment that Aus­tralia would also pur­chase the CSL drug if tri­als proved suc­cess­ful ap­peared to be the cul­mi­na­tion of a deal to get both vac­cines across the line. The CSL vac­cine is due to be­gin sec­ond-stage clin­i­cal tri­als late this year, mean­ing the ear­li­est it could hit the mar­ket would be the mid­dle of next year.</p>
    <p>Should both vac­cines pass clin­i­cal tri­als, Aus­tralia will spend A$1.7 bil­lion (S$1.7 bil­lion) for a to­tal of nearly 85 mil­lion doses, Mr Mor­ri­son said.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment came as Aus­tralia re­ported its low­est one-day rise in new Covid-19 cases since June 26, with 45 in­fec­tions in the past 24 hours, 41 of which were recorded in Vic­to­ria state.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s sec­ond-most pop­u­lous state has been the epi­cen­tre of a sec­ond wave, and now ac­counts for about 75 per cent of the coun­try’s 26,320 cases and 90 per cent of its 762 deaths.</p>
    <p>The south-eastern state on Sun­day ex­tended a hard lock­down in its cap­i­tal Mel­bourne un­til Sept 28, as the daily in­fec­tion rates had de­clined more slowly than hoped.</p>
    <p>The ex­ten­sion of the lock­down in Mel­bourne is ex­pected to fuel fur­ther job losses.</p>
    <p>The Trea­sury has said that the orig­i­nal six-week lock­down had al­ready cost Vic­to­ria around 250,000 jobs.</p>
