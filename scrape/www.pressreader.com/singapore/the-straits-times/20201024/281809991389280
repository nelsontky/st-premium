    <p>LON­DON Mil­lions more peo­ple headed into coro­n­avirus lock­downs in Bri­tain yes­ter­day, as the gov­ern­ment boosted a fi­nan­cial sup­port pack­age but ac­knowl­edged fail­ures in a hugely ex­pen­sive test­ing pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Cen­tral Manch­ester was eerily quiet af­ter the cen­tral gov­ern­ment im­posed its most strin­gent mea­sures on the city and its sur­round­ing re­gion, fol­low­ing bit­ter re­sis­tance from lo­cal lead­ers.</p>
    <p>The English county of South York­shire will also face the same “very high” alert from to­day, with many pubs and hos­pi­tal­ity venues clos­ing and res­i­dents banned from mix­ing with oth­ers in­doors.</p>
    <p>The lat­est mea­sures add to the re­gions al­ready classed as very high risk or tier three, mean­ing roughly 7.3 mil­lion peo­ple in Eng­land will be liv­ing un­der the coun­try’s most strin­gent re­stric­tions from this week­end on.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the de­volved gov­ern­ment in Wales has or­dered its more than three mil­lion peo­ple to stay at home from 6pm yes­ter­day, clos­ing non-food re­tail­ers, restau­rants, pubs and ho­tels for two weeks.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain is bat­tling to get a grip on a resur­gence of Covid-19, which has killed over 44,000 peo­ple there – Europe’s worst na­tional toll.</p>
    <p>But the gov­ern­ment of Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son has re­sisted calls for a se­cond na­tional lockdown, ar­gu­ing that its tiered sys­tem is bet­ter suited to tar­get re­gions fac­ing the big­gest threat.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, the gov­ern­ment im­proved a na­tional jobs sup­port scheme af­ter busi­nesses hit by re­gional lock­downs claimed it did not go far enough to re­place a fur­lough pack­age that ex­pires this month.</p>
    <p>The Trea­sury did not di­vulge the over­all cost, but Mr John­son promised “bil­lions more”.</p>
    <p>To pro­tect the econ­omy and avoid more lock­downs, the gov­ern­ment has set great store by an am­bi­tious pro­gramme to test peo­ple for Covid-19 and trace their con­tacts.</p>
    <p>The re­ported cost so far runs to more than £12 bil­lion (S$21.3 bil­lion). But the num­bers of peo­ple be­ing tested and traced are fall­ing well short of tar­gets, and gov­ern­ment sci­en­tists say the pro­gramme is hav­ing only a mar­ginal im­pact on con­trol­ling in­fec­tion rates.</p>
    <p>“I share peo­ple’s frus­tra­tions... We need to im­prove it,” Mr John­son con­ceded on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Scot­land was ex­pected to an­nounce a new five-tier plan of lo­calised mea­sures yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Scot­tish na­tional clin­i­cal direc­tor Ja­son Leitch has said that Scots should “get their digital Christ­mas ready” and pre­pare to be de­prived of fam­ily con­tact through the fes­tive sea­son.</p>
