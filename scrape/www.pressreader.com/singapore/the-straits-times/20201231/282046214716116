    <p>OSLO • Ten peo­ple were in­jured, one of them crit­i­cally, and 21 oth­ers re­mained un­ac­counted for after a land­slide in south­ern Nor­way swept away more than a dozen build­ings in the early hours of yes­ter­day, police said.</p>
    <p>The land­slide struck a res­i­den­tial area in the mu­nic­i­pal­ity of Gjer­drum, some 30km north of the cap­i­tal Oslo.</p>
    <p>Pho­to­graphs of the site showed a large crater with de­stroyed build­ings at the bot­tom of it. Other build­ings hung on the edges of the crater.</p>
    <p>He­li­copters hov­ered over the area, at times low­er­ing emer­gency re­spon­ders to­wards the de­bris of col­lapsed houses, TV footage showed.</p>
    <p>About 700 peo­ple have been evac­u­ated from the area so far, the police said.</p>
    <p>“There were two mas­sive tre­mors that l asted for a l ong while and I as­sumed it was snow be­ing cleared or some­thing like that,” 68-year-old Oeystein Gjer­drum told broad­caster NRK.</p>
    <p>“Then the power sud­denly went out, and a neigh­bour came to the door and said we needed to evac­u­ate, so I woke up my three grand­chil­dren and told them to get dressed quickly.”</p>
    <p>The miss­ing peo­ple were from homes in the in­ner­most area of the land­slide but it was not im­me­di­ately clear whether they had been trapped in their houses, were away at the time or had man­aged to es­cape, the police said.</p>
    <p>“There are many who are still un­ac­counted for. This is a big catas­tro­phe,” Prime Min­is­ter Erna Sol­berg told re­porters dur­ing a visit to the site.</p>
    <p>The area re­mains un­sta­ble for now and can be ac­cessed only by he­li­copter, said Mr Roger Pet­tersen, head of the police op­er­a­tion at the site.</p>
