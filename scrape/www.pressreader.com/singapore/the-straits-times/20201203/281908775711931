    <p>French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron’s rul­ing party an­nounced this week that it will com­pletely re­write a draft plan that would have curbed the free­dom to share images iden­ti­fy­ing po­lice of­fi­cers, af­ter large protests over the week­end against po­lice vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>Here’s a closer look at the is­sue.</p>
    <p>The story</p>
    <p>It was a “strate­gic re­treat”. Af­ter months of in­sist­ing on the need to in­tro­duce a se­cu­rity law that in­cluded a cu­ri­ous pro­vi­sion ban­ning peo­ple from shar­ing pic­tures of po­lice of­fi­cers for “ma­li­cious pur­poses”, Mr Macron bowed to out­cries from civil lib­erty groups and or­dered his gov­ern­ment to re­write en­tirely the pro­vi­sions of the draft law.</p>
    <p>“It is nei­ther a with­drawal nor a sus­pen­sion but a to­tal rewrit­ing of the text” in or­der to re­move “mis­un­der­stand­ings and doubts”, said Mr Christophe Cas­taner, the leader of the rul­ing La Republique en Marche party.</p>
    <p>Al­though Mr Macron tried to blame his min­is­ters for the de­ba­cle – “the sit­u­a­tion they put me in could have been avoided”, he told a jour­nal­ist – the episode has dealt a blow to a pres­i­dent whose pop­u­lar­ity is al­ready in the dol­drums, and turned the spotlight on the ac­tiv­i­ties of the French po­lice, pre­cisely what Mr Macron sought to avoid.</p>
    <p>Why it mat­ters</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have been wor­ried for some time about the rising level of vi­o­lence in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>This started with the so-called yel­low vest move­ment of coun­try­side pro­test­ers that in­ter­mit­tently paral­ysed France’s main cities for much of last year, but then ex­tended to al­most en­demic van­dal­ism in the de­prived pub­lic hous­ing es­tates.</p>
    <p>France has a his­tory of heavy polic­ing: The gen­darmerie, which is of­ten called in to sup­press riots, is a mil­i­tary force ded­i­cated to im­pos­ing do­mes­tic or­der; and the CRS, a 13,000-strong po­lice re­serve force cre­ated af­ter World War II with the spe­cific objective of riot con­trol, is fa­mous for what po­lice of­fi­cers gin­gerly re­fer to as “ro­bust tac­tics”.</p>
    <p>The wide­spread avail­abil­ity of dig­i­tal cam­eras has meant, how­ever, that al­most any al­ter­ca­tion be­tween the po­lice and demon­stra­tors is now filmed. The clips are up­loaded to the In­ter­net within hours and are of­ten used by demon­stra­tors to dis­credit the po­lice.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties claim that many of the clips are doc­tored with the in­tent of blam­ing the po­lice for vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>There have also been in­stances where po­lice of­fi­cers have been iden­ti­fied from pic­tures and then sub­jected to per­sonal at­tacks, and their fam­i­lies ha­rassed.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new se­cu­rity law, the gov­ern­ment wanted to ban the cir­cu­la­tion of such pic­tures, if the objective was to un­der­mine the au­thor­ity and cred­i­bil­ity of the po­lice. But the en­tire ef­fort was bun­gled.</p>
    <p>The leg­is­la­tion was slop­pily drafted, and the au­thor­i­ties failed to ex­plain that they were not propos­ing to ban the tak­ing of any pic­tures dur­ing riots, but merely their pub­li­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>They also failed to ex­plain when a pub­li­ca­tion ban would ap­ply.</p>
    <p>But most im­por­tantly, the gov­ern­ment failed to re­as­sure not only the pub­lic but also leg­is­la­tors that the mea­sure would not end up shield­ing the po­lice from any ac­count­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>The re­lease of a re­cently made video show­ing po­lice of­fi­cers beat­ing to a pulp a youth of African de­scent did not help mat­ters.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther did the fact that Prime Min­is­ter Jean Cas­tex and In­te­rior Min­is­ter Ger­ald Dar­manin were un­able to spec­ify what mea­sures they would take to en­sure that po­lice use only the min­i­mum of nec­es­sary force to dis­perse ri­ot­ers.</p>
    <p>What’s next</p>
    <p>Af­ter more than 130,000 peo­ple through­out France marched in protest over the past week­end, Mr Macron had no op­tion but to with­draw the Bill.</p>
    <p>The prom­ise is that a new pro­vi­sion is about to be drafted, and may be re­sub­mit­ted to Par­lia­ment ei­ther this month or at the start of the new year.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment is also poised to ap­prove pro­vi­sions that will stiffen jail sen­tences against those con­victed of at­tack­ing po­lice of­fi­cers, thereby of­fer­ing the force some sup­port.</p>
    <p>But with only 16 months re­main­ing be­fore the next pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in which Mr Macron wants to campaign on his law-an­dorder cre­den­tials, the episode is an acute em­bar­rass­ment; he has in­fu­ri­ated lib­er­als, but has not re­as­sured vot­ers who be­lieve in strength­en­ing the hand of the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The de­ba­cle has also left re­la­tions be­tween the po­lice and the pub­lic in France as trou­bled as ever.</p>
