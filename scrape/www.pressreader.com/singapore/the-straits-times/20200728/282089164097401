    <p>A se­rial crim­i­nal who raped his then 23-year-old daugh­ter at knife­point – less than a month af­ter she picked him up from prison, per­suaded her mother to take him in and found him a job – was sen­tenced to 32 years’ jail yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In pass­ing sen­tence, High Court judge Hoo Sheau Peng noted the 53-year-old’s vi­o­lent crim­i­nal past – he was handed jail and can­ing sen­tences for at­tempted mur­der in 2000 and for rob­bery with hurt in 2010.</p>
    <p>“The ac­cused has not learnt from his pre­vi­ous brushes with the law and the lengthy sen­tences that he served,” she said.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Hoo also noted that the man had made “spu­ri­ous al­le­ga­tions” against his daugh­ter, who is now 28, claim­ing that she had framed him and that she had con­sented to the sex­ual acts.</p>
    <p>The man, who is not named due to a gag or­der to pro­tect the vic­tim’s iden­tity, can­not be caned as he is over the age of 50.</p>
    <p>He was found guilty in June of nine charges re­lat­ing to a se­ries of sex­ual and vi­o­lent of­fences he com­mit­ted against the vic­tim in the early hours of March 27, 2016, when they were alone at home.</p>
    <p>The court heard that the vic­tim, who has an older brother and younger sis­ter, was the only per­son to visit the man when he was in prison. Her par­ents di­vorced when she was young.</p>
    <p>When the man was re­leased from prison on March 2, 2016, she went to pick him up, ac­com­pa­nied by her boyfriend and a friend.</p>
    <p>She then per­suaded her mother to let the man stay in the stu­dio flat that the two women shared un­til he found al­ter­na­tive lodg­ings. She also found him a job as a fork­lift driver.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim tes­ti­fied that when she re­turned home in the early hours of March 27 that year, she found him drinking and star­ing an­grily at the blank TV screen.</p>
    <p>She drank with him for a while and then went to bed at about 3am.</p>
    <p>The next thing she knew, he was touch­ing her in­ap­pro­pri­ately while hold­ing a penknife to her neck.</p>
    <p>When she asked him what he was do­ing, he told her not to shout and threat­ened to slash her.</p>
    <p>As she cried and begged him to stop, the man ac­cused her of be­ing in­volved in a plot with her mother and brother to send him to prison.</p>
    <p>He en­gaged in var­i­ous sex­ual acts with her af­ter threat­en­ing to cut her throat if she did not com­ply.</p>
    <p>Af­ter he raped her, she asked tear­fully why he was do­ing this to her when she had been there for him all these years.</p>
    <p>When she grabbed the knife from him, he punched her and tried to stran­gle her.</p>
    <p>He then snatched the knife back and raped her a sec­ond time.</p>
    <p>Later, she asked him for her mo­bile phone and called her boyfriend to pick her up. When he came over, she broke down and told him what her father had done.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, the man al­leged they had con­sen­sual sex that day. In fact, he claimed that she had first se­duced him two days ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Hoo ac­cepted the daugh­ter’s ver­sion and re­jected the man’s “in­cred­i­ble” ac­count.</p>
    <p>The judge con­victed him of two counts of ag­gra­vated rape, one count of ag­gra­vated sex­ual as­sault by pen­e­tra­tion, two counts of caus­ing hurt, two counts of crim­i­nal in­tim­i­da­tion and two counts of out­rage of mod­esty.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Kavita Uthra­p­a­thy noted that the vic­tim had con­tem­plated sui­cide af­ter the rape and was later di­ag­nosed with post-trau­matic stress dis­or­der.</p>
    <p>“The of­fender re­paid her trust, love and con­cern by abus­ing her hor­rif­i­cally,” she said.</p>
    <p>De­fence coun­sel Lau Wen Jin said the man had been trig­gered by what he thought was a con­spir­acy to get him into prison.</p>
