    <p>One Sun­day last De­cem­ber, Madam Becky Chang, 60, had a feel­ing she was about to lose her job in a ship­ping com­pany.</p>
    <p>She had been in the in­dus­try for more than four decades.</p>
    <p>“The next day, my com­pany an­nounced that my di­vi­sion was clos­ing,” she said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But, armed with a wealth of ex­pe­ri­ence and not want­ing to waste it, Madam Chang de­cided to ap­ply for a job at Moovaz, a Sin­ga­pore-based start-up spe­cial­is­ing in in­ter­na­tional mov­ing ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“I thought to my­self, it’s a start-up, full of young peo­ple. Why would they take me? But I kept an open heart and told them dur­ing my in­ter­view that my ob­jec­tive was to im­part my knowl­edge to the com­pany,” she said.</p>
    <p>Soon after, she se­cured a po­si­tion as a ship­ping and pro­cure­ment man­ager at the com­pany, which was founded i n 2017. Now, she is the old­est of 30 Moovaz em­ploy­ees, with the youngest be­ing 23 years old.</p>
    <p>To help her tran­si­tion into her role, Moovaz en­rolled Madam Chang in a nine-month pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­gramme for lo­gis­tics ex­ec­u­tives. She be­gan in April, and is on sched­ule to com­plete the pro­gramme in De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Moovaz co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Lee Junx­ian said that while Madam Chang’s decades of ex­pe­ri­ence in the ship­ping field ticked all the boxes, it was her will­ing­ness to learn that stood out.</p>
    <p>“She taught us that age is re­ally just a num­ber. Becky brings di­ver­sity and en­ergy to the team, and it has been sur­pris­ing and some­thing that I’ve learnt in this process,” said Mr Lee.</p>
