    <p>The other day, crav­ing a bowl of fish­ball noo­dle soup, I went to eat lunch at On Lee, a fa­mous 54-year-old hole in the wall on Hong Kong Is­land. I hadn’t been there since the start of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The cashier at the door, in­stead of greet­ing me with the usual ef­fi­cient nod and ask­ing “How many peo­ple?”, pointed a tem­per­a­ture gun at my fore­head be­fore even al­low­ing me to step in­side.</p>
    <p>In Hong Kong, where space is at a pre­mium and mom-and-pop restau­rants op­er­ate on a paper-thin mar­gin, din­ers typ­i­cally share ta­bles with strangers. This is part of the fun of the Hong Kong eat­ing ex­pe­ri­ence: As you rub­ber­neck, you see what other peo­ple have or­dered and oc­ca­sion­ally strike up cross-ta­ble talk. But that day the chat­ter was muf­fled, and no bowls of roasted chilli oil were be­ing passed across the ta­ble. The own­ers had in­stalled mov­able plex­i­glass par­ti­tions, as per the lat­est rules, to keep cus­tomers apart and con­ver­sa­tional droplets away.</p>
    <p>Be­fore Covid-19, there was the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome (Sars) in 2002-2003. And be­fore that, the bubonic plague, small­pox, lep­rosy, ra­bies and bird flu. In­fec­tious dis­eases have been part of Hong Kong life at least since the ter­ri­tory was colonised by the Bri­tish in 1841.</p>
    <p>And if you dig into this city’s food cul­ture, you’ll find en­dur­ing traces of epi­demics past. For in­stance, ac­cord­ing to food an­thro­pol­o­gist Sid­ney Che­ung, it was Sars that helped es­tab­lish the cus­tom in lo­cal restau­rants of pro­vid­ing sep­a­rate sets of chop­sticks: one for eat­ing, the other for serv­ing.</p>
    <p>This might not seem like a big deal, but in a cul­ture that has a spe­cific term – gaap sung – for tak­ing food from a com­mon plat­ter with your chop­sticks, it is. Now, cour­tesy of the coro­n­avirus, chop­sticks for serv­ing can of­ten be found in even the most hum­ble street eater­ies.</p>
    <p>As for the chop­sticks you eat with, the old-fash­ioned can­is­ters stuffed with com­mu­nal acid-green and neon-or­ange plas­tic chop­sticks that used to grace the ta­bles at On Lee are gone. They have been re­placed by in­di­vid­u­ally wrapped pack­ages of the dis­pos­able va­ri­ety.</p>
    <p>Hot­pot? Not. The Sichuan win­ter tra­di­tion that be­came a Hong Kong year-round rage in the 1990s lost its al­lure in late Jan­uary, af­ter 11 mem­bers of one fam­ily be­came in­fected with the coro­n­avirus from shar­ing a hol­i­day meal over a bub­bling com­mu­nal pot.</p>
    <p>Dim sum, the city’s most fa­mous break­fast and lunch cus­tom, has taken a hit too. Nor­mally it’s a bois­ter­ous oc­ca­sion, with ex­tended fam­i­lies or of­fice mates hun­kered over steamer bas­kets. But in late July, the Hong Kong gov­ern­ment re­stricted restau­rant din­ing to a max­i­mum of two peo­ple per ta­ble. (The rule has re­cently been re­laxed to al­low four peo­ple per ta­ble from Fri­day.) Din­ers have had to ad­just to un­ac­cus­tomed dim sum in­ti­macy: a pair of peo­ple, a few lonely bas­kets and quiet, face-to-face con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Din­ner time has suf­fered es­pe­cially. The typ­i­cal Can­tonese restau­rant meal is a del­i­cate bal­anc­ing act of mul­ti­ple cour­ses, each show­cas­ing a dif­fer­ent in­gre­di­ent, fla­vor, tex­ture, cook­ing method and health ben­e­fit. Or­der­ing the right pa­rade of dishes is an art, and they are sized for group-shar­ing so that din­ers can eat a bit of ev­ery­thing. Down­siz­ing restau­rant meals to only two (or even four) peo­ple means ad­just­ing not just ser­vice and ta­ble size, but also menus and recipes.</p>
    <p>One of the pan­demic’s big­gest ca­su­al­ties here has been the rep­u­ta­tion of wet mar­kets.</p>
    <p>I shop at a wet mar­ket al­most ev­ery day, and it pains me that the place where I buy wrig­gling pom­fret plucked from a bub­bling wa­ter tank by the fish­er­woman her­self is be­ing re­branded world­wide as ground zero for the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Can­tonese cui­sine, how­ever, can’t be main­tained at its high­est ex­pres­sion with­out wet mar­kets, and re­mark­ably the city au­thor­i­ties, both Bri­tish and lo­cal, have got this. De­spite a con­ta­gion-driven ob­ses­sion with hy­giene, they have adapted health reg­u­la­tions with elab­o­rate work­arounds to pre­serve the lo­cal food cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Con­sider the chicken. In Can­tonese cook­ing, there is sim­ply no sub­sti­tute for a just-killed chicken. The clas­sic prepa­ra­tion bak chit gai is de­cep­tively sim­ple: a whole chicken slow-poached in wa­ter, hacked into small pieces and served with a side of dip­ping oil in­fused with gin­ger and scal­lion.</p>
    <p>Get­ting the dish right is not so easy. Can­tonese cui­sine plays with sub­tleties of tex­ture as well as fla­vor. The chicken can’t just taste good; it must feel right in the mouth: ten­der but with a chewi­ness to the bite.</p>
    <p>“You lose that tex­ture if your chicken has been chilled or frozen,” Can­tonese chef and food colum­nist Lau Chun said. He added: “It can get soft and mushy.”</p>
    <p>Over the years, live chicken has been a flash point be­tween Can­tonese cul­ture and West­ern pre­sump­tions of clean­li­ness and cul­tural su­pe­ri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>A lo­cal news­pa­per ar­ti­cle from 1895, the sec­ond year of the bubonic plague, de­scribes the food stalls newly es­tab­lished by the Bri­tish au­thor­i­ties as a “health­ful change” from “the old dirt be­grimed sheds which have for the last years an­swered for the Hong Kong Mar­ket”. Mr Lau, the chef, told me: “There’s al­ways been con­tro­versy over the prac­tice of sell­ing fresh-killed chicken and other live an­i­mals in Hong Kong. It touches is­sues of hy­giene, an­i­mal wel­fare and how sup­pos­edly ‘bar­bar­ian’ we Chi­nese are.”</p>
    <p>In fact, it was lo­cal Chi­nese elites, not the Bri­tish, who spear­headed the drive to elim­i­nate the sale of ex­otic an­i­mals in Hong Kong wet mar­kets af­ter a ra­bies panic hit the city in 1949. The Dogs and Cats Reg­u­la­tion ended the sale and con­sump­tion of those an­i­mals for meat in 1950. Yet, the chicken, even af­ter more than a cen­tury of plagues, bird flus and coro­n­aviruses, is still quite alive and squawk­ing.</p>
    <p>In my old lo­cal street mar­ket in Wan Chai, a neigh­bour­hood in the city cen­tre, two ven­dors in open store­fronts ply their trade across from each other. De­spite the pre­mium price, lines of­ten stretch down the street on Sun­days and around Chi­nese New Year, both high-de­mand chicken oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>Mid­dle-aged women point at their pre­ferred bird in the cage. The butcher holds the re­luc­tant fowl up to demon­strate its size. Soon, feath­ers and squeals are fly­ing from the back of the shop. Watch this scene, and you might think that lit­tle has changed since the 19th cen­tury. But you would be wrong.</p>
    <p>From egg to pot, the con­tem­po­rary Hong Kong chicken has been bred and mon­i­tored and reg­u­lated in ways that wouldn’t have been pos­si­ble even 30 years ago.</p>
    <p>Af­ter bird flu emerged here in hu­mans in the late 1990s, lo­cal health of­fi­cials, along with many politi­cians, called for an end to the live-chicken trade. But in the face of op­po­si­tion from the pub­lic, they even­tu­ally kept bak chit gai on the menu by im­pos­ing near-dra­co­nian health reg­u­la­tions at ev­ery stage of the trade.</p>
    <p>To­day, health of­fi­cials in­spect the city’s 29 gov­ern­ment-reg­is­tered chicken farms once a week. They re­quire a vac­ci­na­tion cer­tifi­cate and blood test for ev­ery bird.</p>
    <p>De­liv­ery trucks must drive through a dis­in­fec­tion pool when en­ter­ing or leav­ing a whole­sale mar­ket. They may carry only birds from the same farm, with no mix­ing. That way any in­fec­tion can be traced with ac­cu­racy.</p>
    <p>Once the tagged-and-tracked chick­ens ar­rive for sale at mar­kets, their cages are sep­a­rated from shop­pers with plex­i­glass par­ti­tions like the ones now com­mon­place in Hong Kong restau­rants.</p>
    <p>For th­ese so­cially dis­tanced chick­ens, the clock is tick­ing. No bird is al­lowed to spend the night at the mar­ket. Come 8pm, the ones that weren’t killed for sale that day will be slaugh­tered and sold the fol­low­ing day as cheaper “chilled” chicken.</p>
    <p>And if even a trace of bird flu ap­pears – in just one chicken – the en­tire pop­u­la­tion might be killed. Mil­lions of fowl have been de­stroyed over the years, af­ter san­i­tary culls in 1997, 2001, 2002, 2008, 2011, 2014 and 2016.</p>
    <p>Faced with an epi­demic and a pub­lic health dilemma, Hong Kong de­vel­oped an in­tri­cate, ex­pen­sive and time-con­sum­ing reg­u­la­tory reg­i­men – all to pre­serve a flavour, a tex­ture and a Can­tonese clas­sic that peo­ple re­fused to give up.</p>
    <p>Food, tra­di­tion and cul­ture are stronger than any­thing a dis­ease can throw at us.</p>
