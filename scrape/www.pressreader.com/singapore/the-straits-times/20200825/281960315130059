    <p>WASHINGTON • TikTok plans to file a law­suit against US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion as early as this week over an ex­ec­u­tive or­der ban­ning trans­ac­tions with the Chi­nese app in the US, the com­pany has said.</p>
    <p>The move would co­in­cide with the Repub­li­can Na­tional Con­ven­tion, a four-day af­fair which cel­e­brates a pres­i­dent who has made “tough on China” a cen­tre­piece of his re-elec­tion bid and has dan­gled the idea of decoupling from China al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>A sub­sidiary of China-based ByteDance, TikTok said last Satur­day that it would chal­lenge the or­der ban­ning trans­ac­tions with the pop­u­lar so­cial me­dia app.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump had given the com­pany a 90-day dead­line to di­vest its US op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The skir­mish is likely to come up fre­quently dur­ing the Repub­li­can meet­ing, at which Mr Trump is ex­pected to speak every night as he makes his case for a sec­ond term.</p>
    <p>The topic that Amer­i­cans are “go­ing to hear from Don­ald J. Trump is how we are go­ing to fight China and the China virus”, Mr Peter Navarro, White House trade ad­viser, said on Fox News Sun­day, us­ing a slur for Covid-19 pop­u­lar with Mr Trump and his ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>China yes­ter­day said some Amer­i­can politi­cians had “at­tempted to stran­gle” TikTok, WeChat, Huawei Tech­nolo­gies and other Chi­nese com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>“China sup­ports the rel­e­vant Chi­nese com­pa­nies us­ing le­gal weapons to safe­guard their le­git­i­mate rights,” For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian told a daily brief­ing in Bei­jing. “China will also con­tinue to use all nec­es­sary mea­sures to pro­tect Chi­nese en­ter­prises’ le­git­i­mate rights.”</p>
    <p>Like other Repub­li­can of­fi­cials, Mr Trump has crit­i­cised Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den for not men­tion­ing China dur­ing his ac­cep­tance speech at the Demo­cratic Na­tional Con­ven­tion last week.</p>
    <p>“You’ve seen the in­tel­li­gence re­ports: China very much wants Joe Bi­den to win,” Mr Trump said last Fri­day to a con­ser­va­tive group.</p>
    <p>The Global Times, a Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party mouth­piece, said last week that Mr Bi­den would be “smoother” to deal with for Bei­jing, a com­ment seized upon by Repub­li­cans.</p>
    <p>“The pro­posed Demo­crat plat­form on for­eign pol­icy showed that if Bi­den wins, the US will re­main tough on China,” the paper wrote.</p>
    <p>“But tac­ti­cally, the US ap­proach would be more pre­dictable, and Bi­den is much smoother to deal with than Trump – a view­point that is shared by many coun­tries.”</p>
