    <p>STAR GAZING: When starry-eyed fans spot Hong Kong su­per­star Chow Yun Fat, they will ask him for a photo and the 65-year-old ac­tor will usu­ally oblige.</p>
    <p>And it seems even celebri­ties them­selves are not im­mune to his charms. When ac­tress Margie Tsang bumped into him at a su­per­mar­ket on Wed­nes­day, she, too, wanted a photo with him.</p>
    <p>Tsang, 55, then posted on Weibo the photo, which showed Chow wear­ing a black T-shirt, a black cap and dark glasses. Tsang had her head on his shoul­der; both were smil­ing at the cam­era.</p>
    <p>She wrote: “Haha, I fi­nally met Brother</p>
    <p>Fat at Kowloon City. I can’t re­mem­ber when was the last time we met. Brother Fat is still Prince Charm­ing, and I am so happy to­day.”</p>
    <p>She also wrote that she had worked with Chow in Po­lice Cadet’85, a TVB se­rial which also fea­tured sev­eral cur­rent big names like Tony Le­ung Chiu Wai, Si­mon Yam, Ca­rina Lau and Sean Lau. In­ci­den­tally, Tsang and Le­ung had played a cou­ple in the se­rial and they also dated in real life. How­ever, their stormy six-year re­la­tion­ship ended in 1988.</p>
    <p>Le­ung is now mar­ried to Ca­rina Lau, while Tsang, who is also known for act­ing in TV se­ri­als such as The Fly­ing Fox Of Snowy Moun­tain (1985) and Dove Of Hope (1990), mar­ried busi­ness­man Stephen Lam in 1996 be­fore they divorced in 2002. They have a 21-year-old son, Hong Kong swim­mer Martin Lam.</p>
