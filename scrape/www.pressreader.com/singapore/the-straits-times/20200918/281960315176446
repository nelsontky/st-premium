    <p>Delaware can rea­son­ably claim to be the most in­nocu­ous state in the United States. The tax-ad­van­ta­geous penin­sula sel­dom in­curs ha­tred, its op­po­site, or even a sec­ond thought from those out­side its nearly one mil­lion res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Chuck Palah­niuk’s novel Fight Club, in which a man seeks de­liv­er­ance from a life of desk-bound av­er­a­ge­ness, has Wilm­ing­ton, its largest city, as an im­plied set­ting.</p>
    <p>Not all politi­cians take af­ter their states, but, de­spite be­ing Penn­syl­va­nia-born, US Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den is Delaware in­car­nate.</p>
    <p>In half a cen­tury of pub­lic life, the for­mer vice-pres­i­dent has never as­sem­bled an in­tense fan base or many ded­i­cated ene­mies.</p>
    <p>His pol­i­tics are mid­dle-of-the-road and his charisma is of the func­tional, baby-kiss­ing sort. The polls sug­gest that US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s sup­port­ers are fewer but in­com­pa­ra­bly more zeal­ous.</p>
    <p>This “en­thu­si­asm gap”, with its sup­posed im­pli­ca­tions for turnout, dis­turbs the sleep of some of Mr Bi­den’s sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>It is also the most pre­cious thing about him.</p>
    <p>The US has had two con­sec­u­tive presidents with mes­sianic fol­low­ings, and it is worse off for the 12-year surge of emo­tion.</p>
    <p>No democ­racy is riper for a pe­riod of tepid lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem with the politi­cian as hero is that even well-mean­ing ones can dam­age civic life in all sorts of ways.</p>
    <p>The most cor­ro­sive is the rais­ing of im­pos­si­ble ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Barack Obama touted his pres­i­dency as the “mo­ment when the rise of the oceans be­gan to slow”. Oth­ers read into his elec­tion the end of Amer­ica’s racial schisms.</p>
    <p>What tran­spired – a con­sci­en­tious, flawed, mildly re­formist ad­min­is­tra­tion – in­evitably struck mil­lions as a griev­ous be­trayal.</p>
    <p>No one who grew up in Mr Tony Blair’s Bri­tain will fail to recog­nise the dive in mass sen­ti­ment from ec­static credulity to em­bit­tered cyn­i­cism. By not start­ing so high, Mr Bi­den can­not fall so low.</p>
    <p>Then there is New­ton’s law on equal and op­po­site forces. One side’s en­thu­si­asm for a leader is the other side’s alien­ation.</p>
    <p>Re­pub­li­cans who di­ag­nose lib­er­als with “Trump de­range­ment syn­drome” are cit­ing a case in point. But it is as noth­ing against their own con­nip­tions about Mr Obama a decade ago.</p>
    <p>In fact, the cur­rent pres­i­dent is best un­der­stood as a howl against the pre­vi­ous one.</p>
    <p>Given that ha­tred of for­mer presidents Bill Clin­ton and Ge­orge W. Bush were also mass-par­tic­i­pa­tion sports, Mr Bi­den prom­ises to be the first</p>
    <p>pres­i­dent since the lat­ter’s fa­ther, whom a large ma­jor­ity of Amer­i­cans could more or less live with.</p>
    <p>What he can­not com­mand in en­thu­si­asm he makes up for in what we might call le­git­i­macy.</p>
    <p>Had he lost the nom­i­na­tion to Mr Bernie Sanders, a Demo­crat with a fer­vent flock, Amer­ica would be in line for an­other di­alling up of par­ti­san ten­sion, who­ever wins in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal en­thu­si­asm is not just the cause of prob­lems, but also the symp­tom of them.</p>
    <p>It can some­times seem that, as the US has atom­ised, cit­i­zens have re­turned to pol­i­tics as a means of emo­tional ex­pres­sion and hu­man be­long­ing. Par­ti­san tribe fills in for fam­ily, neigh­bour­hood, ro­man­tic love and friend­ship.</p>
    <p>A gen­er­a­tion has passed since Har­vard pro­fes­sor Robert Put­nam traced the de­cline of as­so­ci­a­tional life in his es­say, Bowl­ing Alone.</p>
    <p>Cause and ef­fect are night­mares to es­tab­lish, but, start­ing with the new con­gres­sional Re­pub­li­cans of 1994, it has been a gen­er­a­tion of “my party, right or wrong”.</p>
    <p>It fol­lows that one’s leader is not just an ex­ecu­tor of poli­cies but the ob­ject of blind loy­alty.</p>
    <p>“En­thu­si­asm” can be a eu­phemism for some­thing al­to­gether weird and per­ni­cious.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem, in other words, is not Mr Bi­den’s fail­ure to kin­dle pas­sion in peo­ple. It is our psy­chic need for such a per­son in the first place. His elec­tion might reac­quaint the US with pol­i­tics as it should be and has been: a ma­chine for the ar­bi­tra­tion of con­flict­ing claims, and not as the ba­sis of one’s whole iden­tity.</p>
    <p>It is hard to con­vey the cool­ness – in truth, the re­sent­ment – with which Mr Bi­den’s can­di­dacy was met by many Democrats upon its launch 18 months ago. Af­ter their long tryst with Mr Obama, there was some­thing ba­thetic about the man from Wilm­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>The urge to wor­ship a leader is of­ten framed as right-wing, and the Trump base is un­sur­passed in its in­ten­sity. But the itch is ul­ti­mately cross-par­ti­san.</p>
    <p>It was not con­ser­va­tives who made The West Wing, the syrupy tele­vi­sion drama about a near-saint of a Demo­cratic pres­i­dent. It was not con­ser­va­tives who built the now-fal­ter­ing cult of the Kennedys.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den is the cor­rec­tive to an un­healthy trend in his party and coun­try. Noth­ing com­mends him to na­tional lead­er­ship as much as the mild feel­ings that he arouses.</p>
    <p>What­ever en­thu­si­asm has achieved this past decade or so, it is not an Amer­ica at peace with it­self.</p>
