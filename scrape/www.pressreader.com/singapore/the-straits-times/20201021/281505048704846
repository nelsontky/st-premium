    <p>A lawyer who left Sin­ga­pore af­ter more than $33 mil­lion parked in his firm went miss­ing has been slapped with 19 new charges.</p>
    <p>Jef­frey Ong Su Aun was charged yes­ter­day with 14 counts of crim­i­nal breach of trust as an at­tor­ney in­volv­ing more than $17.4 mil­lion, as well as five counts of cheat­ing.</p>
    <p>With this lat­est devel­op­ment, the 43-year-old Sin­ga­porean now faces a to­tal of 31 crim­i­nal breach of trust (CBT) charges linked to nearly $70 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that this is one of the largest</p>
    <p>amounts to date in re­la­tion to such of­fences. In com­par­i­son, the six City Har­vest Church lead­ers were found guilty of mis­us­ing $50 mil­lion in church funds in 2015.</p>
    <p>Ong also faces 45 other charges for of­fences in­clud­ing forgery and cheat­ing. They in­volve an­other $6 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>He was the man­ag­ing part­ner of law firm JLC Ad­vi­sors when more than $33 mil­lion held in es­crow in the firm for a client, Al­lied Tech­nolo­gies, went miss­ing.</p>
    <p>Es­crow is an es­sen­tial ser­vice in cap­i­tal mar­kets that sup­ports trans­ac­tions such as merg­ers as well as ac­qui­si­tions.</p>
    <p>His lat­est CBT charges as an at­tor­ney in­volve more than $17.4 mil­lion that was held in es­crow by JLC Ad­vi­sors for the firm CW Group Hold­ings, which is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Ex­change.</p>
    <p>He is ac­cused of mis­ap­pro­pri­at­ing the monies in 2015 and 2016, and is said to have largely en­gaged in a con­spir­acy with one Wong Koon Lup, whose de­tails were not re­vealed in court doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>Ong is no longer the man­ag­ing part­ner at the firm.</p>
    <p>Wong al­legedly en­gaged in a con­spir­acy to cheat five times be­tween 2016 and 2018.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, the po­lice said: “The five counts of con­spir­acy to cheat were aimed at con­ceal­ing the mis­ap­pro­pri­a­tion of funds from CW Group’s board of di­rec­tors as well as the au­di­tor of CW Group’s sub­sidiaries in Sin­ga­pore, Ernst and Young So­lu­tions.”</p>
    <p>Ong, who ap­peared in court via video link yes­ter­day, was not of­fered bail. His case has been ad­journed to Nov 25.</p>
    <p>He first made the head­lines last year af­ter the monies went miss­ing and he sub­se­quently dis­ap­peared.</p>
    <p>It later emerged that Ong had left Sin­ga­pore for Malaysia in a pri­vate­hire car on May 13 last year.</p>
    <p>He moved to a ho­tel in Kuala Lumpur and be­came un­con­tactable three days later, af­ter he got rid of his mo­bile phone. He was at the ho­tel when of­fi­cers from the Royal Malaysia Po­lice ar­rested him later that month. He was brought back to Sin­ga­pore on May 30 last year.</p>
