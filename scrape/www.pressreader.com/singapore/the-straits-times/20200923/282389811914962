    <p>For­mer Manch­ester United full-back Pa­trice Evra says the club’s dif­fi­cul­ties in the trans­fer mar­ket are the re­sult of lawyers and not foot­ball peo­ple han­dling the ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
    <p>United, who lost their Premier League opener 3-1 at home to Crys­tal Palace on Satur­day, have been linked with Borus­sia Dort­mund’s Eng­land winger Jadon San­cho through­out the close sea­son but they have yet to agree to a deal.</p>
    <p>San­cho re­mains at Dort­mund with United re­fus­ing to meet the Ger­man side’s €120 mil­lion (S$192 mil­lion) ask­ing price, while there have been no re­in­force­ments in de­fence ahead of a gru­elling cam­paign that will see the Red Devils re­turn to the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>So far, United have signed only mid­fielder Donny van de Beek from Ajax. The 23-year-old scored on his de­but against Palace.</p>
    <p>In a video posted on In­sta­gram, ex-France in­ter­na­tional Evra con­trasted United’s cur­rent ap­proach, un­der chief ex­ec­u­tive Ed Wood­ward, with how the club was run when David Gill was CEO and Alex Fer­gu­son the man­ager.</p>
    <p>“When Manch­ester United needed a player they (went) and they talk(ed) to them face-to-face,” Evra, 39, said.</p>
    <p>“When Fer­gu­son and David Gill came to meet me at Monaco, it was worse than an in­ter­view from the CIA or FBI.</p>
    <p>“But now my phone is ring­ing from a sport­ing di­rec­tor from (an­other) top foot­ball club and they say, ‘Pa­trice, can you please ask (con­tract ne­go­tia­tor) Matthew Judge to an­swer his phone’.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple need to un­der­stand we send lawyers to talk to play­ers. So when we send lawyers they talk about num­bers – they are not peo­ple from the foot­ball world,” added Evra, who played for United from 2006 to 2014.</p>
    <p>In two prom­i­nent cases, Dort­mund beat United to the sig­na­ture of Nor­way striker Er­ling Haa­land and English mid­fielder Jude Belling­ham from Birm­ing­ham City.</p>
    <p>“We don’t have any (sign­ings) be­cause we send the wrong peo­ple to speak with them,” Evra said, con­trast­ing United’s ap­proach with how other clubs, such as Real Madrid, tackle re­cruit­ment.</p>
    <p>“They send peo­ple who know the club, who love the club to talk about the club, not some lawyers who only talk about money.”</p>
    <p>Evra was not the only for­mer United player to have pub­licly crit­i­cised the club’s trans­fer pol­icy, with for­mer de­fender Rio Fer­di­nand say­ing: “San­cho was talked about months ago. Still not done, it’s so frus­trat­ing.</p>
    <p>“I’m not say­ing deals are easy to be done but Chelsea are show­ing deals can be done if you put the</p>
    <p>IM­PER­SONAL AP­PROACH</p>
    <p>money down and it’s all done in the right way. That is what’s frus­trat­ing for me and all the Man United fans.”</p>
    <p>Gary Neville, now a pun­dit for Sky Sports, called for the club to sign a cen­tre-back ur­gently af­ter see­ing Vic­tor Lin­de­lof in­volved in all three goals con­ceded against Palace.</p>
    <p>“We can talk about San­cho all we like but un­til United get a cen­tre­back who can run and de­fend oneon-ones, they are never go­ing to win the league,” he said.</p>
    <p>We don’t have any (sign­ings) be­cause we send the wrong peo­ple to speak with them.</p>
