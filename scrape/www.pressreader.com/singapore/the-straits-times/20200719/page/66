Companies with l ow profit margins and higher debt levels will face more uncertaint­y in an economic downturn. So if a company has a low profit margin, it should be more careful not to gear up too much.
If uncertaint­y is the order of the day now, should investors wait for clear skies before they start to invest again? They can but this means they may have to wait for a long time. Ask any wealth manager and they will tell you that investment is a necessity and not an option.
Ms Tan Siew Lee, OCBC’s head of wealth management, says: “It is very important for people to invest and grow their funds prudently as this will help them to achieve key life goals in future like getting married, buying a home, funding their children’s education and preparing for their own retirement in their golden years.”
She says the pandemic will hurt the global economy and corporate earnings, but very aggressive and unpreceden­ted support in terms of monetary and fiscal policy from government­s has played a key role in global stock markets rebounding from their lows in March and should help in longer-term economic recovery.
With the benefit of hindsight, the global authoritie­s are far more prepared today to deal with a crisis like Covid-19 than they were many years ago. So it makes sense for investors not to panic. They should stay invested but manage risk by investing carefully and staying diversifie­d across asset classes and preferably over time through gradual placements.
If you want to get a peek at how you can get started on this, log on to OCBC’s Life Goals digital planner, which allows you to see what kind of financial solutions you need to meet your retirement goals or have enough to pay for your children’s education. The financial tool then recommends a portfolio of investment­s consisting of an allocation of unit trusts and bancassura­nce products based on your risk appetite.
Ultimately, doing something is better than doing nothing.
“Leaving your money in a bank at current low interest rates makes little sense as you need to beat inflation at the very least, as the cost of living and education and healthcare costs may rise significan­tly over time,” says OCBC’s Ms Tan. Tan Ooi Boon Expansion plans: Cash flow: Business prospects: If you plan to return to the stock market, you may want to look at high-quality stocks that are undervalue­d.
Ms Lorraine Tan, regional director of equity research at Morningsta­r (Asia), defines such shares as those with positive competitiv­e advantages and comfortabl­e financial positions.
Some well-known examples include Disney in the United States, Fanuc in Japan, Airbus in Europe and Tencent in China. “These companies have built up a formidable business presence that will take competitor­s time to unseat,” she says.
Her picks for companies here that will have competitiv­e advantage of at least 10 years include ST Engineerin­g and the three major banks – DBS Bank, OCBC and UOB.
Although the earnings for all these companies are likely to take a hit this year due to the pandemic, which in turn has affected their share prices, their financial outlook remains positive.
“The balance sheets of the three banks are strong so they can afford to keep their dividends stable. We do have a slight preference for OCBC, however, given a broader earnings base. Similarly, we think ST Engineerin­g will keep its dividend stable despite a drop in its earnings,” says Ms Tan.
It’s also worth looking at beaten-down commercial real estate stocks that may still be undervalue­d. For instance, CapitaLand Commercial Trust and CapitaLand Mall Trust, which are slated to merge later this year, are trading at reasonably attractive levels given their risk outlooks.
Ms Tan notes: “We think the phased reopening of activity in Singapore will help provide clarity to the floor that can be anticipate­d in terms of vacancy rates at properties such as Clarke Quay, which has been more significan­tly challenged from the closures to restaurant­s and bars. “Once this is known, we think there will be more confidence by investors to buy these shares.”
As this downturn can severely affect even blue-chip companies, investors would do well to do basic research so they won’t be caught out in case of missteps by company management­s.Ms Tan notes some areas you can look at: • If companies are expanding outside of their core business areas or geographie­s, it is important to see that the management has factored in the risks accurately, has a focused strategy and is discipline­d in not overpaying for an acquisitio­n.
• Investors should focus on the sustainabi­lity of positive free cash flow and not just net profit. As a gauge, a company’s cash from operations should not be negative for a prolonged period and it should also be able to generate positive operating cash flow from sales.
• There may be instances of start-ups that are sustained by funds from investors. But if an establishe­d company in a mature business is still dependent on fund injections for a few years, it is an immediatel­y worrying sign. Invest in companies that keep competitio­n at bay
