    <p>MOSCOW • Tens of thou­sands of Be­laru­sians chant­ing “Happy Birth­day, you rat” and fly­ing red-and­white op­po­si­tion flags gath­ered near Pres­i­dent Alexander Lukashenko’s res­i­dence yes­ter­day as pro­test­ers kept up pres­sure on the veteran leader to re­sign.</p>
    <p>Mr Lukashenko, who turned 66 yes­ter­day, is strug­gling to con­tain weeks of protests and strikes af­ter win­ning an Aug 9 elec­tion his op­po­nents say was rigged. He de­nies elec­toral fraud and has said the protests are backed from abroad.</p>
    <p>Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin used a birth­day phone call to in­vite Mr Lukashenko to visit Moscow, a sign of the Krem­lin’s will­ing­ness to back him as he grap­ples with the un­rest and the threat of new Western sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers streamed into cen­tral Minsk, car­ry­ing bal­loons, flow­ers and flags, in the af­ter­noon. Be­larus had a white-red-white flag for a brief pe­riod in the early 1990s and it has be­come a sym­bol of its anti-govern­ment protests.</p>
    <p>Pass­ing cars honked their horns in sol­i­dar­ity. Some women l ay down in protest in front of a cor­don of hel­meted se­cu­rity forces.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers then con­verged on Mr Lukashenko’s res­i­dence, where there were se­cu­rity forces car­ry­ing shields at the ready, as well as wa­ter can­non and pris­oner vans. A col­umn of ar­moured mil­i­tary ve­hi­cles was driv­ing to­wards the city cen­tre, Rus­sia’s In­ter­fax news agency re­ported.</p>
    <p>The po­lice made spo­radic de­ten­tions through­out the day, bundling peo­ple into pris­oner vans. At least 125 peo­ple were de­tained, Rus­sia’s RIA news agency quoted the In­te­rior Min­istry as say­ing.</p>
    <p>Some pro­test­ers re­sisted ar­rest by what ap­peared to be plain­clothes of­fi­cers, a wit­ness said.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier yes­ter­day, video footage shared by lo­cal me­dia showed women in tra­di­tional dress lay­ing sev­eral pump­kins in front of the main govern­ment build­ing, a folk cus­tom in­tended to sig­nal the re­jec­tion of a suitor.</p>
    <p>One of the coun­try’s largest mo­bile op­er­a­tors, A1, said it had re­duced the ca­pac­ity of mo­bile In­ter­net band­width at the govern­ment’s re­quest.</p>
    <p>Be­larus is Rus­sia’s clos­est former Soviet ally and its ter­ri­tory is an in­te­gral part of Moscow’s Euro­pean de­fence strat­egy. Nev­er­the­less, Mr Lukashenko is seen in Moscow as a prickly part­ner.</p>
    <p>In the big­gest sign yet of Rus­sia’s will­ing­ness to in­ter­vene to prop up</p>
    <p>Mr Lukashenko, Mr Putin said last Thurs­day the Krem­lin had set up a “re­serve po­lice force” at Mr Lukashenko’s re­quest, al­though it would be de­ployed only if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>“It was agreed to hold a meet­ing in Moscow in the com­ing weeks,” the Krem­lin said in a statement af­ter the lead­ers’ call yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Union is gear­ing up to im­pose new sanc­tions on Be­larus. Mr Lukashenko, in of­fice for 26 years, threat­ened last Friday to cut off Euro­pean tran­sit routes across his coun­try in re­tal­i­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, France yes­ter­day con­demned an “ar­bi­trary” crack­down on the me­dia in Be­larus af­ter the ac­cred­i­ta­tion of sev­eral jour­nal­ists was with­drawn. “The ar­bi­trary mea­sures taken by the Be­laru­sian au­thor­i­ties against jour­nal­ists vi­o­late press free­dom,” For­eign Min­is­ter JeanYves Le Drian said in a statement.</p>
    <p>He said the cri­sis in Be­larus re­quired “the es­tab­lish­ment of an inclusive na­tional di­a­logue”, adding that “re­pres­sive mea­sures against jour­nal­ists can­not help”.</p>
    <p>The Be­laru­sian au­thor­i­ties on Saturday with­drew the ac­cred­i­ta­tion of jour­nal­ists work­ing for sev­eral for­eign me­dia agen­cies, in­clud­ing Agence France-Presse.</p>
