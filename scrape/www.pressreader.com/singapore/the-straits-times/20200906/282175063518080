    <p>FLORENCE (Italy) Italy man­ager Roberto Mancini ad­mit­ted that he ac­ci­den­tally started Francesco Acerbi ahead of Gior­gio Chiellini for the Na­tions League game against Bos­nia and Herze­gov­ina be­cause he was not wear­ing his spec­ta­cles.</p>
    <p>The sides drew 1-1 in their opener in Florence on Fri­day, end­ing Italy’s un­prece­dented run of 11 suc­ces­sive wins. But Mancini is tak­ing the long view.</p>
    <p>“There was a bit of tired­ness but the boys did well. We just lacked a bit of in­spi­ra­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The im­por­tant thing is that the team played well, the draw doesn’t change any­thing in the judg­ment of the per­for­mance.”</p>
    <p>Lazio cen­tre-back Acerbi won his sev­enth in­ter­na­tional cap when Mancini failed to take a good look at the team sheet.</p>
    <p>Edin Dzeko put the vis­i­tors in front when he fired into the roof of the net with a shot on the turn from a cor­ner in the 57th minute in their League A Group One match.</p>
    <p>Ste­fano Sensi equalised 10 min­utes later with a de­flected shot af­ter Lorenzo In­signe pulled the ball back.</p>
    <p>“It was my fault,” Mancini told a press con­fer­ence when asked about the player mix-up. “They showed me the line-up, I didn’t have my glasses on and just said it was fine... It’s not like we chose a goal­keeper rather than a de­fender, it’s not a mas­sive dif­fer­ence, but yes, it was an er­ror.”</p>
    <p>Chiellini will now start against the Nether­lands to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Italy, play­ing their first match since beat­ing Ar­me­nia 9-1 last Novem­ber, won all 10 of their qual­i­fy­ing matches for Euro 2020 as well as a friendly against the United</p>
    <p>States for the long­est win­ning run in their his­tory. The gap of 291 days be­tween fix­tures was Italy’s long­est since 1945-46.</p>
