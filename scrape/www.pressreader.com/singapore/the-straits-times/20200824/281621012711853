    <p>De­mand for tingkat ser­vices has heated up in re­cent months and reached its peak dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, when most of Singapore stayed home.</p>
    <p>Providers of meal de­liv­ery ser­vices said they saw up to a 100 per cent in­crease in re­quests for tingkat meals, with de­mand surg­ing just be­fore April as Singapore en­tered the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Kim Par­adise man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Cle­ment Tiang said that be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic, it used to pro­vide daily tingkat meals to about 5,000 peo­ple, or about 2,500 house­holds.</p>
    <p>But when the cir­cuit breaker started, this jumped to 10,000 peo­ple daily in just two weeks.</p>
    <p>“The lo­gis­tics be­came so in­tense that we had to rent more ve­hi­cles to do de­liv­er­ies,” said Mr Tiang, 46, adding that while they had pre­pared for a surge, the in­crease went be­yond ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>Kim Par­adise, one of the largest tingkat providers in Singapore, has been in the in­dus­try for more than two decades.</p>
    <p>Mr Tiang said: “We even had to re­ject some or­ders be­cause it was hit­ting 11,000 meals at one point.”</p>
    <p>For smaller player Fat­tyDaddy</p>
    <p>Fat­tyMummy, in­quiries for its tingkat ser­vices started com­ing in around Fe­bru­ary, when work­from-home plans be­gan kick­ing in.</p>
    <p>“When the cir­cuit breaker came in April, or­ders went up and in­creased by about 30 per cent in May,” said the ca­ter­ing firm’s di­rec­tor, Ms Fion Lim, 39.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic, it served about 500 tingkat meals daily. When Covid-19 hit, this reached al­most 750 meals, said Ms Lim.</p>
    <p>“We had to re­ject or­ders be­cause we had reached the max­i­mum ca­pac­ity, and we didn’t have enough man­power.</p>
    <p>“If we had taken in the ex­tra or­ders, it would com­pro­mise the qual­ity of our food and ser­vice,” said Ms Lim.</p>
    <p>She em­ploys about 12 peo­ple, but safe dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions in the kitchen based in Wood­lands made it hard to hire more work­ers.</p>
    <p>FEED­ING THE DE­MAND</p>
    <p>Tingkat ca­ter­ing, which Kim Par­adise touts as an op­tion for house­holds which want “proper and home-cooked” meals, usu­ally ap­peals to work­ing cou­ples, the el­derly and fam­i­lies with young chil­dren, said Mr Tiang.</p>
    <p>But as of late, new cus­tomers have come on board, in­clud­ing front-line staff and those who work from home. “We have ex­ist­ing cus­tomers who in­tro­duce fam­ily or friends to us,” said Mr Tiang.</p>
    <p>More peo­ple stay­ing home dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod played a big part in the rise in tingkat or­ders, said those in the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Tiang said: “If peo­ple do not cook, one of the op­tions is to or­der tingkat. Most peo­ple do not want to eat hawker food or or­der de­liv­ery from restau­rants every day.”</p>
    <p>Ms Lim also said some fam­i­lies chose to or­der tingkat as stay­ing home all day, every day, and hav­ing to pre­pare all three meals proved to be too “over­whelm­ing” for them.</p>
    <p>For Fat­tyDad­dyFat­tyMummy, which has been in the in­dus­try for four years, there was a sig­nif­i­cant in­crease in or­ders for its Love, Tingkat! menu, which of­fers health­ier op­tions.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve con­sumers are more in­ter­ested in eat­ing healthy now as they see it as one of the ways to pre­vent ill­ness,” said Ms Lim.</p>
    <p>In re­cent weeks, how­ever, de­mand for tingkat has dropped, as more peo­ple re­turn to the work­place and ven­ture out to dine at hawker cen­tres and eater­ies.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim said de­mand has dipped to about 600 or­ders a day.</p>
    <p>For Kim Par­adise, daily or­ders have gone down to about 6,000 meals, said Mr Tiang.</p>
    <p>STILL FEEL­ING THE HEAT</p>
    <p>De­spite more or­ders for tingkat meals, busi­ness has not nec­es­sar­ily been boom­ing for tingkat op­er­a­tors, who of­ten have a ca­ter­ing and buf­fet arm.</p>
    <p>With lim­its on so­cial and busi­ness gath­er­ings still in place, the de­mand for mass ca­ter­ing and buf­fets is cur­rently close to zero, said both tingkat providers.</p>
    <p>Mr Tiang said book­ings for ca­ter­ing are down al­most 90 per cent for his com­pany, and the lo­cal ca­ter­ing in­dus­try, which over­all raked in more than $400 mil­lion per year, has taken a hit.</p>
