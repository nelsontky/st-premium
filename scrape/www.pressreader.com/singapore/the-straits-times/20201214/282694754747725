    <p>It is a glo­ri­ously sunny day as eight chil­dren carry planks and plas­tic crates to the gar­den at PCF Sparkle­tots @ Radin Mas.</p>
    <p>Each group of four care­fully as­sem­bles an ob­sta­cle course by ar­rang­ing the planks across the crates un­der the guid­ance of their teacher. They test the set-up by walk­ing across, some ten­ta­tively, oth­ers more con­fi­dently ma­noeu­vring the un­even sur­faces of the logs and wooden stumps that mark the start of their cour­ses.</p>
    <p>An­other group of four kids sit at a ta­ble un­der a shel­tered space in the gar­den. Their teacher takes out a pot­ted plant and ex­plains that some fruits and veg­eta­bles grow un­der the ground.</p>
    <p>“There’s a sur­prise un­der­neath,” she teases, as she in­structs them to search for num­bered en­velopes pasted on the pil­lars around them.</p>
    <p>In­side each en­ve­lope is a part of a puz­zle that the kids piece to­gether to form the mys­tery plant – ginger.</p>
    <p>She takes out a ginger plant from her bag and cuts off small pieces for them to touch and smell. Some make faces at the pun­gent scent and give her the thumbs-down sign when she asks if it smells nice. “It’s nice,” one of the boys in­sists.</p>
    <p>Out­door learn­ing comes alive in the pre-school’s ver­dant gar­den, which spans more than 26,000 sq ft and re­sem­bles some­thing one would see in a pre­mium child­care cen­tre. The pre-school, which can take in 282 chil­dren in to­tal, in­clud­ing 30 ba­bies, charges Sin­ga­pore­ans $770.40 a month for full-day child­care and $1,364.20 for full-day in­fant care. Fees are higher for per­ma­nent res­i­dents and for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>Be­sides themed trails, an am­phithe­atre area and climb­ing walls, there is a wa­ter pump that dis­penses re­cy­cled wa­ter, where the chil­dren queue ex­cit­edly to work as they fill up their wa­ter­ing cans.</p>
    <p>Next to the class­room build­ing, stu­dents have ac­cess to a herb and veg­etable gar­den, a sep­a­rate out­door area for in­fants and an­other out­door learn­ing area. These were off lim­its to The Straits Times team be­cause of Covid-19 safety mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren at the cen­tre spend at least 30 min­utes out­doors a day, weather per­mit­ting. Tak­ing the class­room out­doors helps them learn in many ways, says se­nior cen­tre prin­ci­pal Peter Wong.</p>
    <p>In the ob­sta­cle-build­ing ses­sion, for in­stance, chil­dren learnt about co­op­er­a­tion when they car­ried the planks to­gether and teamed up to cre­ate the struc­ture. It also en­cour­aged cre­ativ­ity and risk-tak­ing, and boosted their mo­tor skills as they nav­i­gated the un­even sur­faces.</p>
    <p>The pre-school opened in Jan­uary and oc­cu­pies part of what used to be Hen­der­son Sec­ondary School, which is now an in­te­grated site. A col­lab­o­ra­tion among var­i­ous govern­ment agen­cies, the site houses an ur­ban farm, Sprout Hub, as well as an up­com­ing nurs­ing home and dial­y­sis cen­tre. This could po­ten­tially lead to ex­pe­ri­en­tial learn­ing and com­mu­nity out­reach op­por­tu­ni­ties for the cen­tre’s stu­dents, Mr Wong says.</p>
    <p>Feed­back from par­ents has been “very pos­i­tive”, he says, as many ap­pre­ci­ate the school’s phi­los­o­phy. He quips: “Once you’re out­doors, any­thing is pos­si­ble to cre­ate an en­rich­ing learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ence for the chil­dren.”</p>
