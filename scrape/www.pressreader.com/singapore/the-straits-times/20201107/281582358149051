    <p>When a grim-faced US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump told re­porters in a brief tele­vised state­ment at the White House that he be­lieved he had won the elec­tion but it was in the process of be­ing “stolen”, it was clear that the 2020 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion had been tainted in the eyes of roughly half the coun­try.</p>
    <p>How­ever, no ev­i­dence has emerged in­de­pen­dently of any of the fraud fo­cus­ing on mail-in bal­lots that he is al­leg­ing.</p>
    <p>The three big broad­cast TV net­works – ABC, CBS and NBC – cut away from the Pres­i­dent’s speech af­ter a few min­utes to their an­chors, who called his claims base­less.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s state­ment on Thurs­day came as his lead over Demo­cratic Party can­di­date Joe Bi­den in Ge­or­gia and Penn­syl­va­nia evap­o­rated, all but clos­ing the door on his bid for a sec­ond term.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier on Thurs­day, the Pres­i­dent tweeted “Stop the count”.</p>
    <p>In his state­ment, he said: “If you count the le­gal votes, I eas­ily win. If you count the il­le­gal votes, they can try to steal the elec­tion from us. If you count the votes that came in late, we’re look­ing at them very strongly.”</p>
    <p>He also slammed “phoney polls… de­signed to keep our vot­ers at home, cre­ate the il­lu­sion of mo­men­tum for Mr Bi­den and di­min­ish Repub­li­cans’ abil­ity to raise funds”.</p>
    <p>There was im­me­di­ate con­cern, in­clud­ing from a few Repub­li­cans, at the Pres­i­dent’s claims.</p>
    <p>For­mer New Jersey gover­nor Chris Christie said: “This kind of thing, all it does is in­flame with­out in­form­ing. And we can­not per­mit in­flam­ma­tion with­out in­for­ma­tion.”</p>
    <p>SLIP­PING AWAY</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ated Press and Fox News have pro­jected Mr Bi­den as the win­ner in Ari­zona, al­though some other me­dia or­gan­i­sa­tions have held off do­ing so. If this win is even­tu­ally con­firmed, it would give the for­mer vice-pres­i­dent 264 elec­toral votes. The tar­get to win the White House is 270.</p>
    <p>In Penn­syl­va­nia, Mr Trump’s lead was nar­row­ing on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day morn­ing, Mr Bi­den moved ahead of Mr Trump. In Ge­or­gia, too, Mr Bi­den had squeaked ahead. In Penn­syl­va­nia, mail-in bal­lots favour Mr Bi­den and are counted last, ac­count­ing for the late surge in a state with a hefty 20 Elec­toral Col­lege votes.</p>
    <p>It was against this back­ground, with Mr Bi­den on the brink of vic­tory, that the Pres­i­dent also charged that tra­di­tion­ally lib­eral Demo­cratic ur­ban ar­eas like Philadel­phia in Penn­syl­va­nia, and</p>
    <p>Detroit, Michi­gan, were cor­rupt and should not be “engi­neer­ing the out­come of a pres­i­den­tial race”.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can Party has launched a bat­tery of law­suits aimed at the elec­tion count­ing process, but most le­gal ex­perts do not ex­pect any­thing more than de­lays to the process.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s tac­tics were re­vealed months ago when he be­gan say­ing mail-in bal­lots were prone to mas­sive fraud, though there is lit­tle or no ev­i­dence that they are. An­a­lysts saw it as an ob­vi­ous bid to un­der­mine the cred­i­bil­ity of the elec­tion in ad­vance.</p>
    <p>Ten­sion is pal­pa­bly climb­ing, fanned by right-wing com­men­ta­tors and con­spir­acy the­o­rists.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, Fox News host Lou Dobbs called for Trump sup­port­ers to “sur­round Philadel­phia”.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s son Don­ald Trump Jr chimed in with a tweet, say­ing his fa­ther should “go to to­tal war over this elec­tion to ex­pose all of the fraud, cheat­ing… that has been go­ing on for far too long”.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the Pres­i­dent’s state­ment on Thurs­day, Eura­sia Group founder Ian Brem­mer tweeted: “That was the most de­struc­tive speech I’ve ever seen de­liv­ered by an Amer­i­can pres­i­dent.”</p>
    <p>DAN­GER­OUS STUFF</p>
    <p>Prince­ton Univer­sity po­lit­i­cal sci­ence pro­fes­sor Ju­lian Zelizer tweeted: “This is dan­ger­ous stuff.</p>
    <p>“The tem­per­a­ture is hot, yet peo­ple are be­ing pa­tient and re­spon­si­ble through­out the vote count. And now he is do­ing ev­ery­thing pos­si­ble to un­set­tle the</p>
