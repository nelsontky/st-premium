    <p>NEW DELHI In­dia’s coro­n­avirus cases crossed six mil­lion yes­ter­day as it surged closer to the United States as the most-in­fected na­tion, and the au­thor­i­ties pressed ahead with reignit­ing the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The vast na­tion is home to 1.3 bil­lion peo­ple, some of hu­man­ity’s most densely pop­u­lated cities and a fee­ble health­care sys­tem, and for sev­eral weeks it has re­ported around 90,000 new cases daily – the high­est in the world.</p>
    <p>Health Min­istry data showed a rise of 82,000 cases yes­ter­day, tak­ing the to­tal to 6.1 mil­lion and clos­ing the gap on the US, which has recorded 7.1 mil­lion in­fec­tions. In­dia could leapfrog the US in the com­ing weeks.</p>
    <p>In­dia has a much lower death rate than other badly-hit na­tions, with al­most 100,000 fa­tal­i­ties so far – fewer than half the grisly toll of 205,000 recorded in the US, which has roughly a quar­ter of the pop­u­la­tion. Brazil has mean­while recorded 140,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi has called on peo­ple to keep wear­ing face cov­er­ings when they ven­ture out­side of their homes.</p>
    <p>“These rules are weapons in the war against corona. They are po­tent tools to save the life of ev­ery cit­i­zen,” Mr Modi said dur­ing his monthly ra­dio ad­dress on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The virus ini­tially hit ma­jor me­trop­o­lises in­clud­ing fi­nan­cial hub Mum­bai and cap­i­tal New Delhi, but has since spread to re­gional and ru­ral ar­eas where health­care sys­tems are even more frag­ile and patchy. “In sev­eral of the pock­ets where the trans­mis­sion is ac­tive, the in­fec­tion has gone into the com­mu­nity,” for­mer na­tional health sec­re­tary Su­jatha Rao told Agence France-Presse (AFP).</p>
    <p>“It is dif­fi­cult to con­trol trans­mis­sion in such sit­u­a­tions and a dra­matic turn­around can per­haps be pos­si­ble only through a rig­or­ous im­ple­men­ta­tion of a lock­down and pre­ven­tive mea­sures like mask wear­ing.”</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment is un­likely to reim­pose ma­jor re­stric­tions af­ter a lock­down in March bat­tered the econ­omy and wrecked the liveli­hoods of mil­lions of peo­ple, par­tic­u­larly the poor.</p>
    <p>Some schools have now re­opened and trains, metros, do­mes­tic flights, mar­kets and restau­rants have been al­lowed to op­er­ate with some re­stric­tions. The Taj Ma­hal also opened again to tourists this month.</p>
    <p>Dr Anand Kr­ish­nan, a com­mu­nity medicine pro­fes­sor at the All In­dia In­sti­tute of Med­i­cal Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi, said the au­thor­i­ties should fo­cus on treat­ing peo­ple who con­tract the virus.</p>
    <p>“The only thing that we can do is take care of peo­ple who are ill – iden­tify them faster and treat them bet­ter. And fol­low the so­cial-dis­tanc­ing norms,” he told AFP. “Be­yond that, I don’t think there is any­thing spe­cific that can be done.”</p>
    <p>Some lo­cals in Delhi told AFP that while they re­mained cau­tious, their wor­ries about the pan­demic had less­ened since the start of the year.</p>
    <p>“I’m out of the house all day be­cause of my work. I don’t step out of the house for any­thing else,” said 23-year-old med­i­cal store worker Umang Chutani.</p>
    <p>“The fu­ture is un­cer­tain but one can only be cau­tious and fol­low all safety pro­to­cols.”</p>
    <p>Mr Hi­man­shu Kainthola, 61, who re­cov­ered from the virus l ast month af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive with two other rel­a­tives, said his fam­ily’s fears “have re­duced sub­stan­tially”.</p>
    <p>“We have made peace with it. We take the nec­es­sary pre­cau­tions and in­vest in in­creas­ing our immunity rather than be­ing anx­ious or scared of it.”</p>
    <p>Cre­ative writ­ing stu­dent San­tosh added that the virus was now “part of our lives”.</p>
    <p>“You can­not shut down ev­ery busi­ness be­cause the econ­omy can­not col­lapse... Covid-19 is not go­ing to pay the rent,” he said.</p>
