    <p>Ju­ven­tus su­per­star Cris­tiano Ron­aldo left the Por­tuguese team camp near Lis­bon yes­ter­day to fly back to north­ern Italy on his pri­vate jet, lo­cal me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>He was said to be “fine and sun­bathing” on Tues­day af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19 which has ruled him out of yes­ter­day’s Na­tions League fix­ture against Swe­den.</p>
    <p>The Por­tuguese fed­er­a­tion said ear­lier on its web­site that Ron­aldo was asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>The five-time Bal­lon d’Or win­ner played in Por­tu­gal’s goal-less Na­tions League draw against France in Paris on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The rest of the squad were “all neg­a­tive” af­ter tests on Tues­day, as were the France team, ac­cord­ing to their re­spec­tive fed­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“We have re­spected all the health mea­sures... and yet it hap­pened,” Por­tu­gal coach Fernando San­tos told a press con­fer­ence. “We have been do­ing tests ev­ery day.”</p>
    <p>Ju­ven­tus de­fender Gior­gio Chiellini said he had spo­ken to Ron­aldo. “He’s fine and was sun­bathing, he’ll be back when he’s ready,” he re­ported.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old striker’s pos­i­tive test is a blow for Ju­ven­tus, as the health pro­to­col in force for Serie A says Ron­aldo must self-iso­late for 10 days and then record a neg­a­tive test be­fore he can re­sume play­ing.</p>
    <p>That means he will miss Juve’s Serie A match at Cro­tone on Satur­day and their open­ing Cham­pi­ons League group stage game at Dy­namo Kiev in a week’s time.</p>
    <p>He also risks miss­ing Juve’s Cham­pi­ons League clash with Barcelona on Oct 28, which was set to pit him against his old ri­val Lionel Messi.</p>
    <p>Ron­aldo’s test re­sult re­opens the con­tro­versy over his de­par­ture from Turin for the Por­tu­gal train­ing camp, which was, ac­cord­ing to the lo­cal health au­thor­i­ties in Italy’s Pied­mont re­gion, a vi­o­la­tion of the virus pro­to­col.</p>
    <p>Ju­ven­tus play­ers left to join their na­tional teams de­spite the Ital­ian cham­pi­ons’ squad be­ing in isolation af­ter two staff mem­bers tested pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
    <p>Roberto Testi, a direc­tor of the re­gional health author­ity, said that lo­cal pros­e­cu­tors had been in­formed of their unau­tho­rised de­par­ture.</p>
    <p>Ju­ven­tus were sent back into isolation when their Amer­i­can mid­fielder We­ston McKen­nie tested pos­i­tive for the virus yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The in­ter­na­tional break has been marked by a host of play­ers con­tract­ing Covid-19. But Eng­land man­ager Gareth South­gate has de­fended the con­tin­u­a­tion of in­ter­na­tional foot­ball.</p>
    <p>“The re­al­ity of the world at the mo­ment is we don’t know what the rules will be. In this day and age you have to live from week to week,” he said. “There is no rea­son in­ter­na­tional foot­ball should be a higher risk. We have Jadon (San­cho) and Kieran (Trip­pier) who travel from abroad but it’s eas­ier for us to get the group to­gether ini­tially, then we try to take the right pre­cau­tions. To this point we’ve been for­tu­nate.”</p>
