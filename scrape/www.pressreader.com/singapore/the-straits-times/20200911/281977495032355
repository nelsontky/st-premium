    <p>The way mo­torists are charged will not change when the satellite Elec­tronic Road Pric­ing (ERP) sys­tem kicks in as the cur­rent model has been ef­fec­tive, said Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Mr Ong said it is much bet­ter to con­tinue con­ges­tion pric­ing in a way that mo­torists are used to when Singapore switches to the new ERP sys­tem in 2023.</p>
    <p>“Dis­tance-based charg­ing is a sig­nif­i­cant pol­icy change which has many im­pli­ca­tions and should be stud­ied care­fully,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mo­torists are now un­der a cor­don-based con­ges­tion pric­ing frame­work where they are charged a one-off fee at gantries lead­ing into more con­gested ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Calls for a dis­tance-based sys­tem, where fees would vary de­pend­ing on how far mo­torists drive, have drawn mixed re­ac­tions. Some think it is more eq­ui­table while oth­ers dread its im­ple­men­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>The new ERP sys­tem is ca­pa­ble of charg­ing by dis­tance, said Mr Ong, “but as a pol­icy we are hold­ing back”.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the Bud­get ear­lier this year, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat had said the tech­nol­ogy for dis­tance-based charg­ing was “still sev­eral years away”.</p>
    <p>In his post yes­ter­day, Mr Ong ad­dressed ques­tions and grouses from mo­torists about the new on­board unit (OBU) that will be in­stalled in ve­hi­cles for free from the sec­ond half of next year.</p>
    <p>The OBU com­prises an an­tenna, a touch­screen dis­play and a pro­cess­ing unit. It has drawn crit­i­cism for</p>
    <p>Calls for a dis­tance-based sys­tem, where fees would vary de­pend­ing on how far mo­torists drive, have drawn mixed re­ac­tions. Some think it is more eq­ui­table while oth­ers dread its im­ple­men­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>its per­ceived bulk­i­ness.</p>
    <p>Some asked why the three-piece unit could not be in­te­grated into one, as with the OBUs is­sued to mo­tor­cy­clists. Oth­ers asked if they could use their phones in­stead and do away with the stan­dard-is­sue units al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said: “Tech­ni­cally there is no prob­lem hav­ing an in­te­grated unit. The is­sue is heat. From time to time, we park our cars un­der the hot sun, and a pro­cess­ing unit on the dash­board could not func­tion with­out a big cool­ing unit.”</p>
    <p>So the con­trac­tor de­signed it to be a sep­a­rate mod­ule un­der the dash­board, in­stead of mak­ing it part of a larger in­te­grated OBU.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong noted that the Land</p>
    <p>Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) may use the OBUs to alert mo­torists about im­por­tant traf­fic-re­lated in­for­ma­tion when needed, a func­tion that would be more dif­fi­cult if mo­torists</p>
    <p>just used their phones.</p>
    <p>Us­ing smart­phones to pay ERP re­mains a “pos­si­ble fu­ture up­grade”, he added.</p>
    <p>“But to start the new sys­tem, bet­ter to have a stan­dard is­sue. If we use our own smart­phones for ERP, there will be op­er­a­tional is­sues like bat­tery run­ning out, for­get­ting to bring smart­phones, et cetera.”</p>
    <p>Data se­cu­rity was also a con­cern for LTA in its de­ci­sion to kick-start the new ERP sys­tem with the OBUs in­stead of smart­phones, he said.</p>
    <p>On con­cerns that the new OBUs could block the wind­screen and af­fect driv­ing, Mr Ong said the di­men­sions are only slightly big­ger than the cur­rent in-ve­hi­cle units’ – 152mm by 80mm, com­pared with</p>
    <p>121mm by 78mm.</p>
    <p>The LTA, to­gether with work­shops, will eval­u­ate how best to in­stall the units to min­imise block­ing of the wind­screen, he added.</p>
    <p>On com­ments about the lack of con­sul­ta­tion on the OBU de­sign, Mr Ong said the LTA had some prac­ti­cal con­straints, hav­ing called an in­ter­na­tional ten­der for the project.</p>
    <p>It had to choose the best sys­tem among the pro­pos­als re­ceived. There­after, it was con­trac­tu­ally bound. “There can be con­sul­ta­tions and change of de­sign but it will af­fect the con­tract,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We will have to see how to do this bet­ter next time.”</p>
