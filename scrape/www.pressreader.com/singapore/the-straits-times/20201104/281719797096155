    <p>Or­di­nar­ily, ma­jor TV net­works and news out­lets will call the race based on exit polls be­fore an of­fi­cial an­nounce­ment is made. The win­ner has been called as early as at 9am, though in 2004, 2008 and 2012 this hap­pened around or just past noon. In 2016,</p>
    <p>Mrs Clin­ton called Mr Trump to con­cede around 3.45pm.</p>
    <p>This year, ex­perts say it can take days or even weeks to count all the bal­lots. Pro­cess­ing and count­ing mail-in bal­lots takes time, and some states can­not start un­til after polls close. Other states ac­cept bal­lots after Nov 3, as long as they are post­marked on Election Day. Ab­sen­tee vot­ing rules may be con­tested in court, length­en­ing the wait be­fore the win­ner is fi­nalised.</p>
    <p>If ei­ther can­di­date ap­pears headed for a big vic­tory, the chances that the re­sult is dis­puted will be lower. But if the con­test is close, and if bal­lots counted later swing the race in favour of Democrats, this could prompt calls from</p>
    <p>Mr Trump that the election is rigged. The Pres­i­dent has also de­clined to say whether he will ac­cept the re­sult of the election, leaving a ques­tion mark hang­ing over how Election Night will turn out.</p>
