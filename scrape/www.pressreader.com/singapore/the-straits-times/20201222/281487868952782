    <p>Labour chief Ng Chee Meng yes­ter­day high­lighted sec­tors with a pos­i­tive out­look next year, such as health­care, biotech and lo­gis­tics.</p>
    <p>But he also listed oth­ers that would likely stay muted, in­clud­ing the avi­a­tion and aerospace sec­tors. Mr Ng spoke at a Straits Times we­bi­nar on job losses and op­por­tu­ni­ties in 2021, along with Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion pres­i­dent Robert Yap.</p>
    <p>The job mar­ket has shown signs for op­ti­mism next year, although some sec­tors will re­main in the dol­drums, labour chief Ng Chee Meng said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The avi­a­tion and aerospace sec­tors, engi­neer­ing clus­ters which sup­port those sec­tors, as well as hos­pi­tal­ity and tourism, are likely to stay muted, he said, not­ing that th­ese are ar­eas in “sur­vival and sus­tain­abil­ity modes”.</p>
    <p>But oth­ers like health­care, biotech and lo­gis­tics should trend pos­i­tively over­all, he said, while ac­knowl­edg­ing that the lo­cal and global health sit­u­a­tion will be a big fac­tor in de­ter­min­ing how the econ­omy re­cov­ers from its low base this year.</p>
    <p>“Gen­er­ally, most work­ers, most busi­nesses will see the uptick,” Mr Ng said at a Straits Times we­bi­nar on job losses and op­por­tu­ni­ties in 2021. ST as­sis­tant news editor Toh Yong Chuan mod­er­ated the event.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Trades Union Congress’ (NTUC) strat­egy for work­ers is to make them fu­ture-proof by keep­ing up with tech­nol­ogy de­vel­op­ments and adapt­ing to the new skills re­quired in the cur­rent land­scape, he said.</p>
    <p>“So whether you are in a chal­lenged sec­tor or in a growth sec­tor, I would say, have a growth mind­set re­gard­less,” Mr Ng said when he urged work­ers to seek out train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties to ex­pand their skill sets to adapt to 2021 and beyond.</p>
    <p>Echo­ing this view, Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion (SNEF) pres­i­dent Robert Yap said: “If (work­ers are) open minded, they adopt life­long learn­ing, are will­ing to skill and reskill, I think there is no prob­lem in Sin­ga­pore­ans find­ing jobs.”</p>
    <p>He said ro­bots do not nec­es­sar­ily re­place hu­man work­ers, but rather make jobs “more sexy” and more pro­duc­tive, and this trans­lates into pos­si­bly bet­ter pay for work­ers.</p>
    <p>In­creased pro­duc­tiv­ity means com­pa­nies can bet­ter sus­tain their busi­nesses which in turn leads to more jobs as well, Mr Yap added.</p>
    <p>Both Mr Ng and Mr Yap also stressed that while work­ers need to con­stantly im­prove them­selves, em­ploy­ers too must em­brace trans­for­ma­tion, in terms of evolv­ing both their work pro­cesses as well as work en­vi­ron­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Yap said SNEF has been look­ing at how to trans­form work­places so that they are age-friendly, so older work­ers re­main rel­e­vant and com­pa­nies can also take in older work­ers who are will­ing to be re­trained.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing a ques­tion on how Sin­ga­pore­ans can fill va­can­cies left by de­part­ing for­eign­ers – non-lo­cals ac­counted for the vast ma­jor­ity of Sin­ga­pore’s em­ploy­ment con­trac­tion over the first three quar­ters of</p>
    <p>this year – Mr Ng em­pha­sised the im­por­tance of ed­u­ca­tion and skills train­ing.</p>
    <p>“We must con­tinue to in­no­vate Skill­sFu­ture on the per­sonal level and also the en­ter­prise level, rid­ing on ini­tia­tives and in­no­va­tions like the NTUC’s com­pany train­ing com­mit­tees to merge dif­fer­ent in­ter­ests so that busi­nesses and work­ers are aligned.</p>
    <p>“Mov­ing in tan­dem, in this way, I think, would give us the best chance to suc­ceed beyond 2021,” he said.</p>
    <p>But Mr Ng pointed out that while pol­icy plan­ning is fo­cused on Sin­ga­pore­ans’ in­ter­est, it would be “toxic to our over­all well-be­ing” if it were to re­ject for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>“With 3.7 mil­lion Sin­ga­pore­ans run­ning a $400 bil­lion, $500 bil­lion econ­omy, we sim­ply do not have enough Sin­ga­pore­ans,” he added.</p>
    <p>Agree­ing, Mr Yap said that if Sin­ga­pore wants to con­tinue at­tract­ing the best global com­pa­nies here, it needs to keep its tal­ent pol­icy open.</p>
    <p>“Other­wise, it’s go­ing to be very dif­fi­cult for us to con­tinue to at­tract (them) be­cause tal­ent is ac­tu­ally global in a sense,” said the SNEF chief.</p>
    <p>Mr Yap also noted that it is im­por­tant for Sin­ga­pore to con­tinue up­grad­ing the skills of its peo­ple and fos­ter the growth of more large Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>“If you have more strong Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies that are global, I think that the Sin­ga­porean core be­comes a lit­tle stronger even at the higher end against all the other multi­na­tional com­pa­nies,” he said.</p>
    <p>SKILLS TRAIN­ING IS KEY We must con­tinue to in­no­vate Skill­sFu­ture on the per­sonal level and also the en­ter­prise level, rid­ing on ini­tia­tives and in­no­va­tions like the NTUC’s com­pany train­ing com­mit­tees to merge dif­fer­ent in­ter­ests so that busi­nesses and work­ers are aligned. Mov­ing in tan­dem, in thisway, I think, would give us the best chance to suc­ceed beyond 2021. LABOUR CHIEF NG CHEE MENG</p>
