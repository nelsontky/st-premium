    <p>It was very trou­bling to read about the young boy who was sex­u­ally abused by his un­cle (Man who sex­u­ally abused young nephew jailed for 22 years, Sept 8).</p>
    <p>The abuser is jailed for 22 years, but the poor young vic­tim will prob­a­bly live with his ad­verse child­hood ex­pe­ri­ence for the rest of his life, and may re­quire life-long ther­apy too.</p>
    <p>In turn, his cop­ing be­hav­iours may po­ten­tially af­fect many oth­ers through­out his life.</p>
    <p>Then, there are the par­ents of the young boy, who may feel shame and guilt for the rest of their lives over the re­al­i­sa­tion that they did not pro­tect their child.</p>
    <p>The act of one man brings down the whole fam­ily and pos­si­bly fu­ture gen­er­a­tions of the same fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Sex­ual abuse of chil­dren re­mains a deeply en­trenched prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Even while we ed­u­cate chil­dren to help them un­der­stand where touch is nor­mal and healthy, and where it is not, we con­tinue to see a rise in such cases.</p>
    <p>So the ques­tion is: Are the pun­ish­ments meted out by the courts a suf­fi­cient de­ter­rence?</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, should we not con­sider life im­pris­on­ment for such of­fences, as in this case?</p>
    <p>Given that ac­cess to pornog­ra­phy is so eas­ily avail­able on the In­ter­net, and that it can feed pae­dophile ten­den­cies in dys­func­tional adults, should we not do more to pro­tect our chil­dren?</p>
