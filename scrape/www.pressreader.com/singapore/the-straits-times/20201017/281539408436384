    <p>1 Cases surge again in US</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new coro­n­avirus cases in the United States is surg­ing once again af­ter growth slowed in late sum­mer. Cases are trend­ing up­wards in most states, many of which are set­ting weekly records for new cases. The pan­demic is also shift­ing to the Mid­west and more rural ar­eas.</p>
    <p>WOR­RY­ING SIGN</p>
    <p>We are start­ing from a much higher plateau than we were be­fore the sum­mer wave. It con­cerns me that we might see even more cases dur­ing the next peak than we did dur­ing ’’ the sum­mer.</p>
    <p>DR CAITLIN RIVERS, an epi­demi­ol­o­gist at Johns Hop­kins Uni­ver­sity, on the coro­n­avirus mak­ing in­roads in new ar­eas.</p>
    <p>NEW YORK • The num­ber of new coro­n­avirus cases in the United States is surg­ing once again af­ter growth slowed in late sum­mer.</p>
    <p>While the ge­og­ra­phy of the pan­demic is now shift­ing to the Mid­west and more rural ar­eas, cases are trend­ing up­wards in most states, many of which are set­ting weekly records for new cases.</p>
    <p>Taken alone, case counts are an im­per­fect mea­sure of the pan­demic’s sever­ity, and it is dif­fi­cult to com­pare the cur­rent num­bers with ear­lier points in the US out­break when test­ing was less wide­spread. But other crit­i­cal mea­sures are show­ing a resur­gence too.</p>
    <p>“We are headed in the wrong di­rec­tion, and that’s re­flected not only in the num­ber of new cases but also in test pos­i­tiv­ity and the num­ber of hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions,” said Dr Caitlin Rivers, an epi­demi­ol­o­gist at Johns Hop­kins Uni­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>“To­gether, I think th­ese three in­di­ca­tors give a very clear pic­ture that we are see­ing in­creased trans­mis­sion in com­mu­ni­ties across the coun­try.”</p>
    <p>The rise since the mid­dle of last month has been es­pe­cially pro­found in the Mid­west and Moun­tain West, where hos­pi­tals are fill­ing up and rural ar­eas are see­ing stag­ger­ing out­breaks. The re­gions are home to al­most all the metro ar­eas with the coun­try’s worst out­breaks right now.</p>
    <p>“We are start­ing from a much higher plateau than we were be­fore the sum­mer wave,” Dr Rivers said.</p>
    <p>“It con­cerns me that we might see even more cases dur­ing the next peak than we did dur­ing the sum­mer.”</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new coro­n­avirus cases per day first peaked in mid-April, when New York City and its sur­round­ing ar­eas were hit hard. New Or­leans, south-west Ge­or­gia and some re­sort towns in the west also saw some of the spring’s worst out­breaks.</p>
    <p>Over the sum­mer, the num­ber of new cases per day soared past the April peak.</p>
    <p>Cases re­mained high af­ter the July surge, and they con­tinue to rise in parts of the South, in­clud­ing Alabama, Arkansas, Mis­sis­sippi and Ten­nessee. In the North-east, the num­ber of new cases stayed re­mark­ably flat over the sum­mer. But num­bers in New York, New Jersey and Mas­sachusetts, while still low, have been ris­ing over the past cou­ple of weeks.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent resur­gence is also par­tic­u­larly rural com­pared with ear­lier stages of the out­break, which hit cities in the north-east and then the Sun Belt.</p>
    <p>Of the 100 coun­ties with the worst per-capita out­breaks in the last seven days, more than half are home to fewer than 10,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>There are rea­sons for op­ti­mism, Dr Rivers said, like in­creased test­ing ca­pac­ity and bet­ter knowl­edge about ef­fec­tive treat­ments and con­tain­ment mea­sures. But, she added, sev­eral fac­tors keep her con­cerned about the cur­rent rise.</p>
    <p>She pointed to the start of flu sea­son, con­tin­ued politi­ci­sa­tion of con­trol mea­sures like mask man­dates and cold tem­per­a­tures that would force peo­ple in­doors, where the virus thrives.</p>
    <p>“I think we are in a dan­ger­ous place,” she said.</p>
