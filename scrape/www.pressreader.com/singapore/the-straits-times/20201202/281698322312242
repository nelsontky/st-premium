    <p>Mr Lee Kuan Yew de­cided to will his 38 Ox­ley Road house to Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong in Au­gust 2011 as he was the only one who was pre­pared not to ben­e­fit fi­nan­cially from the property.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said this yes­ter­day, on the se­cond day of his defama­tion suit against Mr Terry Xu, editor of The On­line Ci­ti­zen (TOC) web­site.</p>
    <p>Mr Xu’s lawyer Lim Tean had con­tended that the late Mr Lee had de­cided to be­queath the house to PM Lee as he had been mis­led by the Prime Min­is­ter into think­ing the property had been gazetted – a sug­ges­tion that PM Lee re­jected.</p>
    <p>The is­sue was not about gazetting but a “po­lit­i­cal one”, PM Lee told the court. It would be un­ten­able and un­ac­cept­able for the fam­ily to in­sist on knock­ing down the house and re­de­vel­op­ing it for pri­vate profit, or seek­ing com­pen­sa­tion for the ac­qui­si­tion – a point he made dur­ing fam­ily dis­cus­sions – he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee Kuan Yew agreed with this, he added.</p>
    <p>PM Lee ac­knowl­edged that he and his sib­lings Lee Hsien Yang and Lee Wei Ling had dis­cussed de­mol­ish­ing the house and build­ing sub-units, but said he had flagged the prob­lem of how it would look if the fam­ily were seen to be prof­it­ing from it. “I said, pro­ceed but... do­nate the pro­ceeds to char­ity and ini­tially my sib­lings agreed. Later on, they changed their minds.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee said: “We dis­cussed it in the fam­ily. I made my point of view clear. My fa­ther weighed it and he even­tu­ally de­cided on that ba­sis that he would will the house to me. He made a judg­ment and it is quite clear that this was one of the fac­tors in the judg­ment.”</p>
    <p>The law­suit cen­tres around a TOC ar­ti­cle pub­lished in Au­gust last year. It ref­er­ences a Face­book post by Dr Lee Wei Ling in which she claimed PM Lee had mis­led Mr Lee Kuan Yew into think­ing 38 Ox­ley Road had been gazetted by the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee Kuan Yew had, in Au­gust 2011, told the fam­ily of his de­ci­sion to will the house to PM Lee as part of his share of the es­tate.</p>
    <p>This came af­ter he met the Cabi­net on July 21 that year, where min­is­ters were unan­i­mous in ex­press­ing their op­po­si­tion to knock­ing down the house, with the ex­cep­tion of PM Lee, who did not ex­press a view.</p>
    <p>Af­ter meet­ing the Cabi­net, Mr Lee Kuan Yew had asked PM Lee for his view on what the Gov­ern­ment would do with the house af­ter he died.</p>
    <p>Said PM Lee: “I gave him my hon­est as­sess­ment. I told him that he had met the Cabi­net and heard the min­is­ters’ views... it would be very hard for me to over­ride them and knock the house down.</p>
    <p>“I added that I would have to agree that the house had to be gazetted to be kept, and if I was not the prime min­is­ter or I did not chair the meet­ing, all the more likely the house would be gazetted. Mr Lee un­der­stood. I did not tell him then or at any time that the house had been gazetted.”</p>
    <p>Asked by Mr Lim whether he had pro­posed to his fa­ther that the house be given to him, PM Lee said he had made such a sug­ges­tion, but the de­ci­sion was for his fa­ther to make.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim also asked if PM Lee would ac­cept that at some point, his fa­ther thought the house would be gazetted.</p>
    <p>PM Lee replied that he did not have any in­for­ma­tion on that, but judg­ing from e-mails in 2012, it would ap­pear that his fa­ther be­lieved so at some stage.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim sug­gested that PM Lee never chal­lenged his fa­ther’s un­der­stand­ing of the gazetting, to which he replied that there was no mis­un­der­stand­ing.</p>
    <p>Ref­er­enc­ing an e-mail by Mr Lee Kuan Yew to the Cabi­net in De­cem­ber 2011, PM Lee said: “He didn’t say since the house had been gazetted, there­fore we will re­in­force it and let it out. It is just that he has heard the min­is­ters’ views. If the house is to be re­tained then the fol­low­ing should hap­pen... So it is quite clear what he meant.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim later pointed to e-mails, in­clud­ing one Mr Lee Kuan Yew sent to his lawyer Kwa Kim Li on Sept 6, 2012, that he said showed Mr Lee be­lieved 38 Ox­ley Road had been gazetted. He sug­gested PM Lee had mis­led his fa­ther into be­liev­ing this.</p>
    <p>Re­ject­ing Mr Lim’s point, PM Lee said he had not dis­cussed the mat­ter with his fa­ther, and had no mo­tive to do so. “It is not whether the house has been gazetted or not, and if gazetted, it can­not be de­vel­oped, but whether or not it is ten­able for the fam­ily to re­de­velop the house, even if it is not gazetted, in the face of pub­lic de­mand that it be pre­served and kept as a her­itage site,” he added. “And there­fore, noth­ing turned on whether it was gazetted or not.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee’s lawyer, Se­nior Coun­sel Davin­der Singh, asked if gazetting was even a rel­e­vant point.</p>
    <p>The Prime Min­is­ter replied: “No, be­cause even if it had not been gazetted, and I, af­ter in­her­it­ing the house, had been al­lowed to re­de­velop it and I had prof­ited from it, I think it would have been a hu­mon­gous stink. It is im­pos­si­ble.”</p>
