    <p>Six days af­ter the High Court ac­quit­ted his for­mer maid of theft and ques­tioned his mo­ti­va­tion in lodg­ing a po­lice re­port against her, spark­ing an on­line back­lash, Mr Liew Mun Leong re­signed from his posts in four or­gan­i­sa­tions yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The 74-year-old stepped down as chair­man of Changi Air­port Group (CAG) and Sur­bana Jurong, and from his po­si­tions as se­nior in­ter­na­tional busi­ness ad­viser at Singapore in­vest­ment firm Te­masek and as a board mem­ber of Te­masek Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment last night on his de­ci­sion to “bring for­ward my re­tire­ment” from the four or­gan­i­sa­tions, Mr Liew said he did not wish his cur­rent sit­u­a­tion to be a dis­trac­tion to their re­spec­tive boards, man­age­ment and staff, amid their many crit­i­cal pri­or­i­ties.</p>
    <p>He added: “The High Court has made its de­ci­sion. I have faith in our le­gal sys­tem and re­spect the de­ci­sion of the High Court.”</p>
    <p>Mr Liew noted that both the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) and the po­lice are con­duct­ing re­views of the mat­ter. “Should it be re­quired, my fam­ily and I will con­tinue to pro­vide full co­op­er­a­tion to both AGC and the po­lice,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Liews’ for­mer helper of nine years, Ms Parti Liyani, 46, was convicted of theft last year but was ac­quit­ted on ap­peal last Fri­day by Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn.</p>
    <p>The judge noted that the po­lice re­port against her was made to pre­vent her re­turn to Singapore to make a com­plaint against them for il­le­gally de­ploy­ing her to clean the house and of­fice of Mr Liew’s son Karl.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Liew sought to ex­plain why he lodged the re­port for theft, say­ing his fam­ily dis­cov­ered some of their be­long­ings in Ms Parti’s boxes, and he “gen­uinely be­lieved that if there were sus­pi­cions of wrong­do­ing, it is our civic duty to re­port the mat­ter to the po­lice and let the au­thor­i­ties in­ves­ti­gate ac­cord­ingly”.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Min­istry of Fi­nance (MOF) and CAG an­nounced that for­mer PUB chair­man Tan Gee Paw, who has been a CAG board di­rec­tor since 2017, has been ap­pointed its act­ing chair­man.</p>
    <p>CAG was cor­po­ra­tised in 2009 and has re­mained di­rectly owned by the Gov­ern­ment. Mr Liew has been its chair­man since 2009.</p>
    <p>The MOF said it had taken note of the ob­ser­va­tions of the High Court judge, and the fur­ther re­view that the AGC is un­der­tak­ing.</p>
    <p>Both MOF and CAG also ac­knowl­edged the sig­nif­i­cant con­tri­bu­tions Mr Liew had made to the de­vel­op­ment of Changi Air­port as a pre­mier air hub. CAG said he played a piv­otal role in the air­port’s cor­po­rati­sa­tion, which paved the way for it to op­er­ate more flex­i­bly amid a com­pet­i­tive avi­a­tion en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Liew Mun Leong yes­ter­day said he re­spects the de­ci­sion of the High Court, which last Fri­day ac­quit­ted his for­mer maid of steal­ing from his fam­ily and raised ques­tions about his mo­ti­va­tion in lodg­ing a po­lice re­port against her.</p>
    <p>“The High Court has made its de­ci­sion. I have faith in our le­gal sys­tem and re­spect the de­ci­sion of the High Court,” he said in a state­ment an­nounc­ing his de­ci­sion to step down from four pub­lic ap­point­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Liew, 74, said he had de­cided to “bring for­ward my re­tire­ment” from these roles, as he did not wish his cur­rent sit­u­a­tion to be a dis­trac­tion to the or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, he stepped down as chair­man of Changi Air­port Group (CAG) and Sur­bana Jurong.</p>
    <p>He had been chair­man of CAG since 2009, as well as Sur­bana in 2013, be­fore it be­came Sur­bana Jurong two years later.</p>
    <p>He has also re­signed from his po­si­tions as se­nior in­ter­na­tional busi­ness ad­viser at Singapore in­vest­ment com­pany Te­masek and as a board mem­ber of the Te­masek Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>“Those who know me, will know I am pas­sion­ate about the roles and mis­sions of these or­gan­i­sa­tions,” he said. “I do not wish my cur­rent sit­u­a­tion to be a dis­trac­tion to their re­spec­tive boards, man­age­ment and staff, amidst their many crit­i­cal pri­or­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>Mr Liew, who is also the for­mer chief ex­ec­u­tive of Cap­i­taLand, added that should it be re­quired, he and his fam­ily will con­tinue to pro­vide full co­op­er­a­tion to the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) and the po­lice in their re­view of the case.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn ac­quit­ted the Liews’ for­mer In­done­sian maid Parti Liyani of steal­ing from the fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti, 46, who worked for the fam­ily from 2007 to 2016, was ac­cused of steal­ing over $34,000 worth of items.</p>
    <p>A district judge found her guilty of four charges of theft and handed down a 26-month jail sen­tence in March last year. She ap­pealed against the con­vic­tion and sen­tence in the High Court.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Ms Parti was cleared of a fifth charge of fraud­u­lent pos­ses­sion of prop­erty, free­ing her of all crim­i­nal charges.</p>
    <p>In his j udg­ment, Jus­tice Chan noted that “some time prior to her ter­mi­na­tion”, Ms Parti had ex­pressed un­hap­pi­ness at be­ing made to do ad­di­tional work in clean­ing the house and of­fice of Mr Liew’s son, Mr Karl Liew.</p>
    <p>“There is rea­son to be­lieve that the Liew fam­ily, upon re­al­is­ing her un­hap­pi­ness, took the pre-emp­tive first step to ter­mi­nate her em­ploy­ment sud­denly with­out giv­ing her suf­fi­cient time for her to pack, in the hope that Parti would not use the time to make a com­plaint to MOM (Min­istry of Man­power),” the judge said.</p>
    <p>Given two hours to pack her be­long­ings into boxes be­fore be­ing repa­tri­ated home, she got an­gry and threat­ened to lodge a com­plaint with the MOM about the il­le­gal work de­ploy­ments.</p>
    <p>Two days later, when she was back in In­done­sia, Mr Liew and his son made a po­lice re­port af­ter the fam­ily al­legedly found their be­long­ings i n three boxes, which the younger Mr Liew had agreed to pay to ship to her.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan said that once she had made clear – upon be­ing fired – of her de­sire to com­plain to MOM, the Liew fam­ily “fol­lowed up with the po­lice re­port to en­sure her re­turn would be pre­vented”.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti, who was un­aware of the al­le­ga­tions, re­turned to Singapore on Dec 2, 2016 to find work, and was ar­rested upon her ar­rival at Changi Air­port.</p>
    <p>The AGC, po­lice and MOM have said that they are re­view­ing the han­dling of the case, which has also led to an on­line back­lash against Mr Liew.</p>
    <p>In his state­ment yes­ter­day, Mr Liew out­lined why he lodged the re­port, say­ing: “When my fam­ily dis­cov­ered some of our be­long­ings in Ms Liyani’s boxes, I pro­ceeded to make a po­lice re­port the same af­ter­noon I re­turned from over­seas – be­cause I gen­uinely be­lieved that if there were sus­pi­cions of wrong­do­ing, it is our civic duty to re­port the mat­ter to the po­lice and let the au­thor­i­ties in­ves­ti­gate ac­cord­ingly.”</p>
    <p>The po­lice had con­ducted their in­ves­ti­ga­tions, said Mr Liew, adding that Ms Parti was sub­se­quently ar­rested by the po­lice and later charged by the pub­lic prose­cu­tor.</p>
    <p>“Through­out the in­ves­ti­ga­tions and trial, my fam­ily mem­bers and I co­op­er­ated fully with the po­lice and gave state­ments and ev­i­dence when re­quired,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Liew, who is a reg­is­tered pro­fes­sional civil en­gi­neer, added that should it be re­quired, he stands ready to as­sist or ad­vise – with­out com­pen­sa­tion, and in any way ap­pro­pri­ate, given the on­go­ing chal­lenges posed by Covid-19 – the or­gan­i­sa­tions he stepped down from.</p>
    <p>MR LIEW MUN LEONG, who has stepped down as chair­man of Changi Air­port Group and Sur­bana Jurong. He has also re­signed from his po­si­tions at Singapore in­vest­ment com­pany Te­masek and the Te­masek Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>The High Court has made its de­ci­sion. I have faith in our le­gal sys­tem and re­spect the de­ci­sion of the High Court.</p>
    <p>MR LIEW</p>
