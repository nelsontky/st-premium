    <p>The Govern­ment has hired a com­pany to con­duct re­search on on­line groups that pro­vide safe spa­ces for dis­cus­sion. The study could pro­vide a blue­print for how po­ten­tially di­vi­sive con­ver­sa­tions, such as those on race and lo­cal-for­eigner integratio­n, can be con­ducted and man­aged. The ten­der calls for the de­vel­op­ment of a set of community guide­lines or code of con­duct to fos­ter co­he­sive be­hav­iour on­line.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment has hired a com­pany to con­duct re­search on on­line groups that pro­vide safe spa­ces for dis­cus­sion.</p>
    <p>The study could pro­vide a blue­print for how po­ten­tially di­vi­sive con­ver­sa­tions, such as those on race and lo­cal-for­eigner integratio­n, can be con­ducted and man­aged.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the ten­der doc­u­ments, the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Community and Youth (MCCY) is ask­ing the firm to de­velop a set of community guide­lines or code of con­duct to fos­ter co­he­sive be­hav­iour on­line.</p>
    <p>Last Tues­day, it awarded a ten­der – val­ued at $74,000 – to data science firm This Is Syn­the­sis.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries, MCCY told The Straits Times that it wants to un­der­stand the fac­tors that con­trib­ute to “pro-so­cial” norms and be­hav­iours in on­line com­mu­ni­ties that pro­vide a safe space for dis­cus­sions.</p>
    <p>An MCCY spokesman said: “The in­sights would help our on­go­ing work in pro­mot­ing a gra­cious and car­ing so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the ten­der doc­u­ments, MCCY wants the firm to rec­om­mend strate­gies to en­cour­age pos­i­tive on­line dis­course, for in­stance, “un­der­stand­ing and ad­dress­ing po­ten­tially di­vi­sive be­hav­iour such as un­civil ar­gu­ments, and bul­ly­ing over cer­tain top­ics or by cer­tain types of on­line per­son­al­i­ties”.</p>
    <p>It is also ask­ing the firm to iden­tify pro-so­cial groups that the min­istry can en­gage to ad­vo­cate pro-so­cial norms.</p>
    <p>Dr Natalie Pang, a se­nior lec­turer at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s com­mu­ni­ca­tions and new me­dia de­part­ment, said pro-so­cial com­mu­ni­ties en­gage in ac­tions that ben­e­fit mem­bers, such as shar­ing knowl­edge and help­ing one an­other.</p>
    <p>Pro-so­cial be­hav­iour and dis­course re­fer to ac­tions and con­ver­sa­tions that are of help to oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity law don Eu­gene Tan said the study may be an ef­fort by the Govern­ment to bet­ter un­der­stand and sup­port pro-so­cial on­line com­mu­ni­ties, and en­able more of them to thrive.</p>
    <p>He said: “There is prob­a­bly the think­ing that in­stead of the main mode of deal­ing with dis­sent be­ing a clam­p­down on an­ti­so­cial dis­course and an­ti­so­cial on­line com­mu­ni­ties – which are of­ten a vo­cal mi­nor­ity in the on­line space – it would be bet­ter to nudge the other com­mu­ni­ties to be a voice of rea­son, to be pro-so­cial.”</p>
    <p>The move to study safe on­line spa­ces comes in the wake of dis­cus­sions on sen­si­tive top­ics such as race, for­eign labour and so­cial in­equal­i­ties be­com­ing more po­larised on­line and off­line, said those in­ter­viewed by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>So­cial me­dia al­go­rithms are de­signed to show users posts they would prob­a­bly like, or posts from peo­ple they al­ready like. Over time, peo­ple may lose sight of dis­courses out­side their on­line so­cial net­works, Dr Pang said, and as a re­sult be­come more en­trenched in their views.</p>
    <p>Also, with the eco­nomic troubles wrought by the Covid-19 pan­demic, more peo­ple are feel­ing the pain of job losses and other dis­rup­tions to their lives.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Tan said: “This makes the dis­course even more chal­leng­ing be­cause it is now in­flected by vis­ceral emo­tions, a deep sense of un­fair­ness and a hi­jacked nar­ra­tive, which makes a rea­soned, ob­jec­tive and even-handed dis­cus­sion more un­likely.”</p>
    <p>While a code of con­duct can pro­vide a set of guide­lines for on­line com­mu­ni­ties to ob­serve, the chal­lenge is get­ting the buy-in from peo­ple, the experts said.</p>
    <p>Some will see the guide­lines as yet an­other top-down ini­tia­tive to cur­tail dis­sent, they added.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Leong Chan-Hoong of the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences’ Cen­tre for Ap­plied Re­search said there are al­ready guide­lines some on­line com­mu­ni­ties have adopted, such as pro­hibit­ing hate speech and doxxing.</p>
    <p>In some in­stances, groups have mod­er­a­tors who purge in­ap­pro­pri­ate posts or com­ments, among other things, he added.</p>
    <p>Prof Tan said that for a code to be ef­fec­tive, it has to be de­vel­oped or­gan­i­cally from the ground up.</p>
    <p>One sug­ges­tion, he said, is for the Govern­ment to in­volve pro-so­cial on­line groups in the de­vel­op­ment of any code of con­duct.</p>
    <p>Prof Tan said: “In other words, the code must be owned by the on­line community.</p>
    <p>“It can­not be foisted on them.”</p>
