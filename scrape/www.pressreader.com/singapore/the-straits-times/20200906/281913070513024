    <p>WASH­ING­TON China has taken the most ac­tive role among coun­tries seek­ing to in­ter­fere in the United States elec­tion and has the big­gest pro­gramme to in­flu­ence do­mes­tic pol­i­tics, US Na­tional Se­cu­rity Ad­viser Robert O’Brien said on Fri­day, with­out pro­vid­ing any de­tails.</p>
    <p>“We know the Chi­nese have taken the most ac­tive role,” he told re­porters at a brief­ing, adding that China had “the most mas­sive pro­gramme to in­flu­ence the United States po­lit­i­cally”, fol­lowed by Iran and then Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>US in­tel­li­gence found that Rus­sia or­ches­trated a cy­ber cam­paign to sway the 2016 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in Repub­li­can Don­ald Trump’s favour and there have been re­ports that hack­ers may try to in­flu­ence the elec­tion on Nov 3. Moscow has de­nied in­ter­fer­ing in 2016.</p>
    <p>“We’ve made it very clear to the Chi­nese, to the Rus­sians, to the Ira­ni­ans and oth­ers that haven’t been pub­licly dis­closed that any­one... that at­tempts to in­ter­fere with the Amer­i­can elec­tions will face ex­tra­or­di­nary con­se­quences,” Mr O’Brien said.</p>
    <p>Trump-ap­pointed At­tor­neyGen­eral William Barr said last Wed­nes­day he be­lieved China was more of a threat than Rus­sia when it came to elec­tion in­ter­fer­ence, also with­out of­fer­ing de­tails.</p>
    <p>Last month, Mr O’Brien said the US had seen Chi­nese hack­ers tar­get­ing US elec­tion in­fra­struc­ture. China has con­sis­tently de­nied US govern­ment charges that it hacks US firms, politi­cians or govern­ment agen­cies.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry has said Bei­jing has no in­ter­est in in­ter­fer­ing in the US elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has made get­ting tough on China a key part of his cam­paign for re-elec­tion as US pres­i­dent and blames China for the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In a speech to the Repub­li­can Na­tional Con­ven­tion last month, he said that Bei­jing sup­ports his Demo­cratic op­po­nent Joe Bi­den and “des­per­ately” wants him to win.</p>
    <p>Asked to pro­vide spe­cific de­tails of Chi­nese elec­tion in­ter­fer­ence, Mr O’Brien said: “I am not go­ing to go into all the in­tel­li­gence, but the mas­sive ac­tiv­i­ties of the Chi­nese and cy­ber realm, it’s re­ally an ex­tra­or­di­nary thing that we’re fac­ing.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion is con­sid­er­ing whether to add China’s top chip­maker, Semi­con­duc­tor Man­u­fac­tur­ing In­ter­na­tional Corp (SMIC) to a trade black­list, a De­fence De­part­ment of­fi­cial said on Fri­day, as the US es­ca­lates its crack­down on Chi­nese firms.</p>
    <p>A Pen­tagon spokesman said that the De­fence De­part­ment was work­ing with other agen­cies to de­ter­mine whether to make the move against SMIC, which would force US sup­pli­ers to seek a dif­fi­cult-toob­tain li­cence be­fore ship­ping to the com­pany.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier last week, the Pen­tagon made a pro­posal to place SMIC on the en­tity list to the End User Com­mit­tee, a panel that makes de­ci­sions about en­tity list­ings, a per­son fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has of­ten used the en­tity list – which now in­cludes more than 275 China-based firms – to hit key Chi­nese in­dus­tries, from telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions equip­ment giants Huawei Tech­nolo­gies and ZTE over sanc­tion vi­o­la­tions, to sur­veil­lance cam­era maker Hikvi­sion over sup­pres­sion of China’s Uighur mi­nor­ity.</p>
    <p>SMIC is the largest Chi­nese chip man­u­fac­turer but is sec­ond-tier to ri­val Tai­wan Semi­con­duc­tor Man­u­fac­tur­ing (TSMC), the in­dus­try’s mar­ket leader. It has sought to build foundries for the man­u­fac­ture of com­puter chips that can com­pete with TSMC.</p>
    <p>But it is also fac­ing new US re­stric­tions that re­quire Huawei’s chip man­u­fac­tur­ers to seek US li­cences be­fore pro­duc­ing chips for the tele­coms gi­ant, if they rely on US chip­mak­ing tech­nol­ogy. SMIC is one of Huawei’s man­u­fac­tur­ers.</p>
