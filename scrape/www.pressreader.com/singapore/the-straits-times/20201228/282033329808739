    <p>In its party elec­tion yes­ter­day, the Work­ers’ Party (WP) sent its four Sengkang GRC MPs to its top de­ci­sion-mak­ing body in a renewal of its lead­er­ship ranks.</p>
    <p>It also re­turned its top lead­ers, sec­re­tary-gen­eral Pri­tam Singh, 44, and chair­man Sylvia Lim, 55, un­op­posed to their posts.</p>
    <p>The bi­en­nial in­ter­nal elec­tion comes on the back of the WP’s strong show­ing in the July gen­eral elec­tion. Yes­ter­day, all 10 of the party’s MPs were elected into its cen­tral ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee (CEC).</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the me­dia af­ter the party’s four-hour cadre mem­bers’ con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, Mr Singh said: “We have party elec­tions every two years and the cadre mem­ber­ship is free to vote in other in­di­vid­u­als onto the CEC.</p>
    <p>“But I think this time around, the cadre mem­ber­ship recog­nises the im­por­tance of this renewal tra­jec­tory that we are on hav­ing a good bal­ance of ex­pe­ri­ence and new blood. So, it has been a pos­i­tive af­ter­noon.”</p>
    <p>Among the new faces in the CEC are the WP’s four Sengkang GRC MPs: Ms He Ting Ru, 37; Ms Raeesah Khan, 27; As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Ja­mus Lim, 44; and Mr Louis Chua, 33.</p>
    <p>The quar­tet pulled off the big­gest up­set of the July 10 polls, tak</p>
    <p>ing Sengkang GRC from a Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) team com­pris­ing labour chief Ng Chee Meng, 52, as well as other of­fice-hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Party mem­bers at the CEC elec­tion said on con­di­tion of anonymity that Prof Lim was among those who gar­nered the high­est num­ber of votes yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Two of the party’s East Coast GRC can­di­dates were also elected into the CEC – Ms Ni­cole Seah, 34, and Mr Ken­neth Foo, 43, a pre­vi­ous CEC mem­ber.</p>
    <p>Asked if this sig­nalled that the party would field a team in that GRC at the next gen­eral elec­tion, Mr Singh said it was too early to dis­cuss the mat­ter, but added that with hard-work­ing peo­ple like Ms Seah and Mr Foo on the ground, there was a “higher chance that you will do well and you will meet the out­comes that you are bet­ting for”.</p>
    <p>The WP has con­tested East Coast since the 2006 elec­tion. But</p>
    <p>the sur­prise move of Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat to an­chor the con­stituency for the PAP in this year’s elec­tion threw up ques­tions about whether the WP would relook its strat­egy.</p>
    <p>The other mem­bers elected to the WP CEC in­clude Mr Singh and Ms Lim’s fel­low Alju­nied GRC MPs – Mr Muhamad Faisal Ab­dul Manap, 45, Mr Gerald Giam, 43, and Mr Leon Per­era, 50 – as well as Hougang MP Den­nis Tan, 50.</p>
    <p>For­mer WP leader Low Thia Khi­ang, 64, and for­mer Hougang MP Png Eng Huat, 59, who both re­tired from pol­i­tics at the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion, also re­main mem­bers of the CEC.</p>
    <p>While there had been spec­u­la­tion ahead of the party elec­tion that older mem­bers might step down in the spirit of renewal, Mr Singh said yes­ter­day that he was glad they have re­mained on the team, given their ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>He cred­ited them for play­ing a large part in shap­ing the WP into “more of a main­stream op­po­si­tion party” and dis­closed that he had asked Mr Low to stay on to help out, with Ms He and Ms Raeesah set to go on ma­ter­nity leave soon.</p>
    <p>“He has got a rich and long his­tory of po­lit­i­cal con­tests in Sin­ga­pore. (He knows) what the re­al­i­ties of an op­po­si­tion party are, what can be done, what can’t be done,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I think the younger mem­bers will ben­e­fit tremen­dously from that in­put, so I’m par­tic­u­larly pleased (about) Mr Low’s con­tin­ued mem­ber­ship and par­tic­i­pa­tion in the CEC.”</p>
    <p>Ms Lim said she had thought about whether she should stay on af­ter 17 years in her post, but was asked to do so by other CEC mem­bers.</p>
    <p>She said: “We are of course con­sciously groom­ing our younger lead­ers to take over in due course from my po­si­tion. Ex­actly when that will hap­pen will de­pend on many fac­tors, and also what the party needs at a par­tic­u­lar point in time.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, newly elected CEC mem­bers Ms Seah and Mr Chua told re­porters that they looked for­ward to learn­ing from the more ex­pe­ri­enced lead­ers and mem­bers.</p>
    <p>The party said in a state­ment that the new CEC “has taken of­fice and started work with im­me­di­ate ef­fect”.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ous CEC mem­bers who were not re-elected in­clude for­mer Alju­nied GRC MP Chen Show Mao and for­mer Non-Con­stituency MP Daniel Goh, who re­main mem­bers of the party.</p>
    <p>Also step­ping down are Mr Firuz Khan, Ms Lee Li Lian, Dr John Yam and Mr Ter­ence Tan.</p>
