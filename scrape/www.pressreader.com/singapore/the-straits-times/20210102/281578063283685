    <p>If you think marathon­ers and triath­letes are a rare or spe­cial breed, wait till you meet</p>
    <p>Lua Jiong How and Vicki Zhu. The Sin­ga­pore­ans are into ul­tra­ma­rathons and have both com­pleted the four-day 120km Half Marathon des Sables.</p>
    <p>A bot­tle of Coca-Cola is all it takes to make a life­long friend in the desert.</p>
    <p>The cold bev­er­age, of­fered by a fel­low run­ner from Bri­tain, was what warmed Lua Jiong How’s heart in Oc­to­ber 2017 as he stood at the start line for the fi­nal day of the Half Marathon des Sables (HMDS) in Fuerteven­tura, the Ca­nary Is­lands.</p>
    <p>A “rookie mis­take” had threat­ened to un­ravel the Sin­ga­porean’s metic­u­lously planned first desert race out­ing – he had ar­rived in Fuerteven­tura af­ter his multi-stop flight with only a back­pack. His lug­gage with all his food sup­plies had gone miss­ing in tran­sit.</p>
    <p>As par­tic­i­pants are re­quired to com­plete the four-day, 120km race with more than 10kg of gear and food sup­plies on their backs, Lua had to scram­ble to buy sup­plies from the is­land’s min­i­mart.</p>
    <p>But the big­gest chal­lenge of his ca­reer also came with a gen­er­ous dose of ca­ma­raderie.</p>
    <p>On the fi­nal day of rac­ing in 40 deg C heat, team­mate Anna-Marie Wat­son gave him the Coke bot­tle – which or­gan­is­ers had handed out to run­ners the day be­fore – that she had saved for him.</p>
    <p>“Coke is a pre­cious com­mod­ity – you sip it slowly and don’t drink it in gulps. She didn’t touch hers and gave it to me and I was very touched by her ges­ture,” said the 25-year-old, who is pur­su­ing a post­grad­u­ate diploma in ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Other par­tic­i­pants also came to his res­cue dur­ing the race, chip­ping in to do­nate en­ergy bars, ce­real and iso­tonic drinks to him and another com­peti­tor who had also lost his lug­gage.</p>
    <p>Lua added: “No mat­ter how com­pet­i­tive it is, the nice thing is ev­ery­one is like fam­ily as we are sur­viv­ing to­gether with noth­ing. There was a Dutch guy who couldn’t adapt to the heat and he said he would give me what­ever he had in his bag but that I had to sur­vive.”</p>
    <p>A life­time of mem­o­ries and friend­ships made over a mu­tual love of na­ture, ad­ven­ture and out­door run­ning is what drives peo­ple</p>
    <p>A TASTE TO DIE FOR</p>
    <p>like Lua and fel­low run­ner Vicki Zhu to join desert trail races.</p>
    <p>While there are a num­ber of desert trail races around the world, the well-known events in­clude the Marathon des Sables (French for Marathon of the Sands) – a six­day, 250km ul­tra­ma­rathon held in the Sa­hara desert in Morocco that is re­garded as the tough­est foot race any­where – and the 4 Deserts Ul­tra­ma­rathon Se­ries held in Namibia, Gobi, Ata­cama and Antarc­tica. There are also two Half Marathon des Sables in Fuerteven­tura and Peru, which are four-day races over 120km.</p>
    <p>Driven by the ex­plo­sion in ul­tra­ma­rathon events and par­tic­i­pants, desert trail run­ning has also picked up in pop­u­lar­ity over the years. The first MDS in 1986 had 23 pi­o­neer run­ners and its 30th an­niver­sary drew a record 1,300 com­peti­tors, while the 4 Deserts events get be­tween 800 and 1,000 par­tic­i­pants each year.</p>
    <p>Like many desert trail run­ners, Lua’s jour­ney be­gan with trail run­ning and ul­tra­ma­rathons. A for­mer floor­ball player and bare­foot run­ner, he had re­ceived an in­vi­ta­tion to join the HMDS from a spon­sor and signed up as “the self-ef­fi­ciency ap­pealed to me”.</p>
    <p>With just two months to train as he had re­cently re­turned from a geog­ra­phy field trip in Thai­land, he had to get used to run­ning on sand and trained with a 12kg back­pack at the South­ern Ridges to sim­u­late race con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>He said: “I was desert rac­ing for the first time and the lo­gis­ti­cal night­mare was in­tim­i­dat­ing and a steep learn­ing curve – how to cut weight in your bag for ex­am­ple. I did it by trial and er­ror and my friends who had done MDS helped me a lot.”</p>
    <p>Fel­low Sin­ga­porean Zhu, who joined the HDMS in Peru in De­cem­ber 2019 via a spon­sor in­vite, had no idea what she had signed up for un­til two months be­fore the race.</p>
    <p>“I only knew it was in the desert and I thought it would be cool to run a stage race… I didn’t know what I was get­ting my­self into,” said the 34-year-old, an of­fer and sup­ply leader at De­cathlon.</p>
    <p>Un­daunted by the chal­lenge af­ter she re­alised she had to carry all her gear and sup­plies, she weighed each item in her race back­pack and even tested her por­ta­ble stove at Sen­tosa’s Tan­jong beach to en­sure it worked.</p>
    <p>But as the race got un­der way in Peru, Zhu suf­fered from blis­ters on her toes and her phys­i­cal con­di­tion wors­ened af­ter she in­jured her knee the next day. She even­tu­ally fin­ished the race on painkiller­s.</p>
    <p>The ex­treme heat, ter­rain and gru­elling dis­tances of 40 to 50km a day can re­sult in in­juries, fa­tigue, de­hy­dra­tion and even hal­lu­ci­na­tions, and non-fin­ish­ers are par for the course.</p>
    <p>De­spite this, the run­ners would not trade their desert rac­ing ex­pe­ri­ences for any­thing else. “It was a jour­ney of dis­cov­ery, a jour­ney of friend­ship and au­then­tic re­la­tion­ships,” said Lua, who hopes to com­plete the MDS in the fu­ture. “In mod­ern life, you can get caught up and over there, you can chill and that’s the nice part.”</p>
    <p>Zhu is aim­ing to com­pete in the 4 Deserts se­ries next year be­fore tak­ing on the 330km Tor des Geants in Italy and even­tu­ally, the Ul­traTrail du Mont-Blanc, a sin­gle-stage mountain ul­tra­ma­rathon of 171km that runs through France, Italy and Switzer­land.</p>
    <p>“To me, it’s not about how fast I fin­ish but I like to do these races as I en­joy the scenery and I en­joy run­ning in na­ture and be­ing able to visit dif­fer­ent coun­tries.”</p>
    <p>On what ad­vice he would give to be­gin­ners, Lua said: “Do your home­work and pre­pare well as lo­gis­tics can be a headache – even a sin­glet used for a marathon may not work. It’s easy to get caught up in it… but it’s im­por­tant to re­mem­ber what you set out to do.”</p>
    <p>When all else fails, in­clud­ing the air­line tasked to trans­port lug­gage on time, they can count on the kind­ness of fel­low run­ners, just like Lua’s Coke-gift­ing com­pan­ion.</p>
    <p>Coke is a pre­cious com­mod­ity – you sip it slowly and don’t drink it in gulps. She didn’t touch hers and gave it to me and I was very touched by her ges­ture.</p>
