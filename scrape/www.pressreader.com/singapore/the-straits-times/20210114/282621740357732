        <p>A star­tling pair of art­works hangs side by side in Of Hu­man Bondage, a new show of nudes at home­grown gallery The Cul­ture Story.</p>
        <p>A graphite draw­ing by Chua Mia Tee and an oil paint­ing by Lim Yew Kuan each de­picts a slim girl seated with her legs tucked to one side, hands folded on a cloth draped dis­creetly over her lap.</p>
        <p>The sim­i­lar­i­ties, from fa­cial features to hair­style to pos­ture, sug­gest the same model posed for the two Sin­ga­porean artists, al­though Chua’s work is dated 1975 while Lim’s is from 1974.</p>
        <p>Dr Yanyun Chen, 34, who re­searches the is­sue of nu­dity in Sin­ga­pore art, says it has been dif­fi­cult to find doc­u­men­ta­tion about fig­ure draw­ing prac­tices in the 1970s.</p>
        <p>She says: “These works re­veal life fig­ure draw­ing prac­tices among Sin­ga­porean artists in the 1970s and can point us to­wards un­der­stand­ing how such prac­tices could have found their way into lo­cal art cur­ric­ula and be­come (at the time) a sig­nif­i­cant part of art ed­u­ca­tion.”</p>
        <p>The Cul­ture Story co-founder Chong Huai Seng, 70, bought Lim’s work from a Malaysian art dealer.</p>
        <p>Af­ter the pur­chase, he had a mo­ment of dis­quiet about its prove­nance, so he got in touch with Lim, former prin­ci­pal of the Nanyang Acad­emy of Fine Arts (Nafa) and son of the school’s founder Lim Hak Tai. “He said, yes, it was his work, and even is­sued me a cer­tifi­cate of au­then­tic­ity.”</p>
        <p>A year af­ter ac­quir­ing Lim Yew Kuan’s paint­ing, Mr Chong was wan­der­ing around Tan­glin Shop­ping Cen­tre when he saw the Chua sketch hang­ing in an art gallery.</p>
        <p>He noted the sim­i­lar­i­ties at once. “My mind was work­ing over­time. These two works might be his­tor­i­cally im­por­tant – the artists might have been in the same class.”</p>
        <p>Chua, a Cul­tural Medal­lion re­cip­i­ent known for his so­cial re­al­ism and land­scapes, stud­ied at Nafa and was taught by Lim Hak Tai.</p>
        <p>There are other rare nudes by Sin­ga­porean artists in the show, in­clud­ing a pair of bold sketches by Tang Da Wu, an oil paint­ing by Tan Choh Tee and one by Lee Boon Wang. There are also three large works by Teng Nee Cheong, one of Sin­ga­pore’s best fig­u­ra­tive artists.</p>
        <p>In to­tal, there are 38 works by 22 artists, in­clud­ing Chi­nese, In­done­sian and Mex­i­can artists, on dis­play.</p>
        <p>Mr Chong has been col­lect­ing nudes for more than 30 years since pur­chas­ing his first sketch in St Ives in Corn­wall, Eng­land in 1986. He says: “I be­lieve in us­ing sto­ries to con­nect with art.”</p>
        <p>As he takes vis­i­tors around the gallery he co-founded with his daugh­ter Ning Chong, he shares anec­dotes about how he came to own the pieces.</p>
        <p>An early water­colour on pa­per by Chi­nese artist Long Rui, for ex­am­ple, was part of about 30 works he bought in the 1990s when the artist showed in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
        <p>When there were un­sold works at the end of the show, Mr Chong says the gal­lerist of­fered them to him at a dis­count. He bought the bun­dle. “I was a stock­bro­ker then and quite gung-ho.”</p>
        <p>The con­nec­tion proved use­ful later when he was try­ing to or­gan­ise an art show in Bei­jing and needed Long Rui’s help to en­dorse the show. By then, the artist had be­come the head of the China Na­tional Acad­emy of Paint­ing. In the light of Mr Chong’s early pa­tron­age, Long of­fered him a 50 per cent dis­count on pay­ment for ser­vices.</p>
        <p>“My man­ager and I had to lug two pa­per bags full of one mil­lion yuan to his of­fice in the mid­dle of win­ter,” re­calls Mr Chong.</p>
        <p>Over the years, he has no­ticed a re­lax­ation of at­ti­tudes to­wards nudes, from frown­ing judg­ment to ac­cep­tance. When artists and col­lec­tor friends learnt he was putting to­gether this show, he adds, many told him they col­lected nudes too.</p>
        <p>“Maybe this show will trig­ger some awak­en­ing or think­ing with other col­lec­tors to re-eval­u­ate this genre of art,” he says.</p>
