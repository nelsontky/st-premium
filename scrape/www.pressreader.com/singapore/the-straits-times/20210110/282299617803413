    <p>It is still about a month to Chi­nese New Year, but restau­rant book­ings are com­ing in fast for the fes­ti­val eve’s re­u­nion din­ner on Feb 11.</p>
    <p>Venues like Wah Lok Can­tonese Restau­rant in Carl­ton Ho­tel Singapore have been booked up since Dec 20 for both seat­ings that night.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the ho­tel said: “Book­ings started com­ing in from early De­cem­ber. We also re­ceived many calls to in­crease the num­ber of seats to eight af­ter the Govern­ment’s an­nounce­ment of phase three, which started on Dec 28.”</p>
    <p>Un­der phase three, the num­ber of per­sons al­lowed at each ta­ble has been in­creased from five to eight.</p>
    <p>Re­sorts World Sen­tosa’s Can­tonese restau­rant, Feng Shui Inn, is al­ready full for both seat­ings on Chi­nese New Year’s Eve.</p>
    <p>It is also serv­ing re­u­nion din­ner at its Aqua Gas­tron­omy pop-up in­side the S.E.A Aquar­ium, where all eight ta­bles placed un­der lit pods have been taken up. Only a few ta­bles out­side the pods, which can seat up to four per­sons, are still avail­able.</p>
    <p>The Crys­tal Jade Group sim­i­larly re­ports that its fine-din­ing restau­rants, which in­clude Crys­tal Jade Golden Palace at Paragon and Crys­tal Jade Palace at Takashimay­a, are full. Its more ca­sual out­lets, such as Crys­tal Jade Kitchen, are 90 per cent full.</p>
    <p>It has three re­u­nion din­ner seat­ings start­ing from 5pm.</p>
    <p>The group’s spokesman said: “We are now open­ing lunch slots for book­ings. The first reser­va­tions came in as early as the mid­dle of last year and many cus­tomers con­firmed their book­ings in the days that fol­lowed the phase three an­nounce­ment.”</p>
    <p>Tardy din­ers need not fret, though they should act fast. Some restau­rants still have ta­bles, though th­ese are be­ing snapped up quickly.</p>
    <p>Xin Cui­sine Chi­nese Restau­rant at Hol­i­day Inn Singapore Atrium is full for its first seat­ing, but half full for the sec­ond round at 8pm.</p>
    <p>Peach Gar­den, which has five out­lets in­clud­ing ones at OCBC Cen­tre and Thom­son Plaza, says it is about 50 per cent booked up for both its seat­ings. Golden Pe­ony at Con­rad Cen­ten­nial Singapore is run­ning at about 70 per cent full.</p>
    <p>At the Pu­tien chain, which has 13 out­lets in­clud­ing ones at Kitch­ener Road, I on Or­chard and Jewel Changi Air­port, about 40 per cent of ta­bles have been spo­ken for.</p>
    <p>But in­quiries have been pour­ing in. The spokesman for Con­rad said: “Book­ings are much faster and ear­lier this time as guests want to se­cure a place for their re­u­nion meal.”</p>
    <p>Crys­tal Jade has no­ticed the same trend. Its spokesman said: “In­quiries came in much ear­lier last year, likely due to cus­tomers be­ing wor­ried that seats will be booked out.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, most con­firmed their reser­va­tions much later as they were wait­ing for the an­nounce­ment from the Govern­ment on the in­crease in dine-in num­bers per ta­ble.”</p>
    <p>Restau­rants are also bank­ing on an uptick in take­away or­ders.</p>
    <p>Xin Cui­sine has re­ceived three times the num­ber of take­away or­ders for Chi­nese New Year’s Eve com­pared with pre­vi­ous years.</p>
    <p>Peach Gar­den, too, saw a surge in in­quiries for take­aways or­ders. Its spokesman said: “Or­gan­i­sa­tions which used to host Chi­nese New Year din­ners for their staff have also switched to or­der­ing food de­liv­ery to be sent to their em­ploy­ees’ homes. Thus, the de­mand for take­away this year is a lot more and spend­ing per or­der has also in­creased.”</p>
    <p>But the pic­ture is not all rosy. Although the ban on serv­ing al­co­hol af­ter 10.30pm does not af­fect Chi­nese restau­rants, which typ­i­cally do not open past that time, safe distancing rules that trans­late to fewer ta­bles and smaller groups mean that rev­enue is down.</p>
    <p>The spokesman for Wah Lok said: “Be­fore Covid-19, we used to re­ceive a lot of ta­ble reser­va­tions that were for more than 10 per­sons, some for even up to 25 per­sons. We will def­i­nitely see some im­pact in terms of re­duced rev­enue.”</p>
    <p>Con­rad’s spokesman con­curred: “The ho­tel will have to in­cur ad­di­tional costs to en­sure safety mea­sures are ad­hered to. Ad­di­tional work­force will also be re­quired since all the dishes will need to be plated and served in­di­vid­u­ally.”</p>
