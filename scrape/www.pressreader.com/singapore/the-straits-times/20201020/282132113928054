    <p>Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs and Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Muham­mad Faishal Ibrahim’s oral re­ply to a par­lia­men­tary ques­tion about Singapore’s ex­ist­ing im­mi­gra­tion pol­icy is too opaque to be use­ful.</p>
    <p>To be con­vinc­ing, he should elab­o­rate on three is­sues.</p>
    <p>He said the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs was aware of “the need to main­tain the racial bal­ance in Singapore’s pop­u­la­tion in or­der to pre­serve so­cial sta­bil­ity and har­mony”. He added that “the pace and pro­file of our im­mi­gra­tion in­take have been, and will con­tinue to be, cal­i­brated to pre­serve this racial bal­ance”.</p>
    <p>First, what ex­actly does chang­ing the racial bal­ance af­fect? While of­ten cited by the Gov­ern­ment, it is not self-ev­i­dent that pre­serv­ing so­cial sta­bil­ity and har­mony re­quires the main­te­nance of the racial bal­ance. What in­di­ca­tors of “so­cial sta­bil­ity and har­mony” is it re­ly­ing on?</p>
    <p>Ab­stract no­tions of “so­cial sta­bil­ity and har­mony” are not use­ful to ground pub­lic pol­icy if they are not prop­erly op­er­a­tionalised. Are we talk­ing about the per­cep­tion of threat by the ma­jor­ity group? Or about trust in the com­mu­nity? How sen­si­tive are these in­di­ca­tors of “so­cial sta­bil­ity and har­mony” to small, medium and large changes in the racial bal­ance?</p>
    <p>Se­cond, what spe­cific mea­sures are we tak­ing? Based solely on nat­u­ral growth, the Malay pop­u­la­tion is grow­ing at a quicker rate than the other races. But based on a study by AMP Singapore, the heavy in­flux of non-Malay mi­grants means that there is a risk of the pro­por­tion of Malays in the Singapore pop­u­la­tion de­clin­ing. So what ex­actly are we do­ing to main­tain the racial bal­ance? Are we slow­ing the over­all im­mi­gra­tion rate? Are we en­cour­ag­ing more Malay mi­grants? How ag­gres­sively are we tak­ing these mea­sures?</p>
    <p>Third, how use­ful will our rigid mark­ers of race con­tinue to be, given our in­creas­ing diver­sity?</p>
    <p>The pro­por­tion of mixed race or transna­tional per­sons in the pop­u­la­tion is likely to in­crease in the fu­ture. Cul­tural het­ero­gene­ity within the racial groups will in­crease with im­mi­gra­tion aimed at ful­fill­ing the needs of our econ­omy and our age­ing pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Im­pos­ing CMIO (Chi­nese, Malay, In­dian, Oth­ers) cat­e­gories on to the in­creas­ingly di­verse pop­u­la­tion will be­come more and more con­trived.</p>
    <p>Con­se­quently, the im­pli­ca­tions of a blunt po­si­tion like</p>
    <p>“main­tain­ing the racial bal­ance” on “so­cial sta­bil­ity and har­mony” will change over time, even if the pol­icy it­self does not change.</p>
    <p>How does the Gov­ern­ment eval­u­ate the ef­fec­tive­ness of such a pol­icy vis-a-vis other mea­sures – for in­stance, those that en­sure equal­ity of op­por­tu­nity re­gard­less of race or na­tional ori­gin?</p>
