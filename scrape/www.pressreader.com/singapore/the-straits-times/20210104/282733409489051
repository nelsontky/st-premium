    <p>Home-grown singers Gen­tle Bones and Ben­jamin Kheng were not ex­actly sober when they de­cided to re­lease a song to­gether.</p>
    <p>Kheng re­calls: “We’ve been talk­ing about it for a while – and one day at a wed­ding, and I think we were drunk, we were like, ‘Are we go­ing to do this or not?’”</p>
    <p>They were at a mu­tual friend’s wed­ding in late 2019 when they fi­nally firmed up the col­lab­o­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>Then the pan­demic hap­pened and the duo had to wait un­til af­ter the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod be­fore they could book a mu­sic stu­dio for a song­writ­ing ses­sion.</p>
    <p>It re­sulted in the breezy pop tune, Bet­ter With You, which is the ti­tle track of a two-song EP that Gen­tle Bones, whose real name is Joel Tan, re­leased re­cently.</p>
    <p>The other song, Put My Hands Up, is a hip-hop-in­flu­enced track.</p>
    <p>Work­ing to­gether was “sym­bi­otic”, the pair tell The Straits Times in a Zoom in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>They say the l yrics – about check­ing in on a loved one – were timely, given the un­cer­tainty caused by the global pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Kheng, 30, says: “It’s a year when we re­ally did need to check in on peo­ple, not just our­selves, and we needed to just lift peo­ple up. The song is quite un­abashedly that. Lyri­cally, it plainly says it’s try­ing to coax some­one al­most off the ledge.</p>
    <p>“I think many peo­ple had it tough l ast year and ev­ery­one’s deal­ing with it in his own way, so it was nice to kind of write a song that was just straight up a feel­good song.”</p>
    <p>The mu­si­cians have long been fans of each other’s work.</p>
    <p>In 2014, they re­leased their first col­lab­o­ra­tion, a spo­ken-word track ti­tled Father, Father.</p>
    <p>Kheng, who de­scribes Tan as “one of – if not the – best pop writ­ers we have in Sin­ga­pore”, says re­leas­ing a song to­gether is a dream come true.</p>
    <p>Tan, 26, is equally ef­fu­sive when speak­ing of Kheng’s work, say­ing he has been a fan of the lat­ter’s band, The Sam Wil­lows, for years.</p>
    <p>The quar­tet, one of the most pop­u­lar lo­cal bands i n re­cent times, are on hia­tus as the mem­bers fo­cus on solo ca­reers.</p>
    <p>Tan, the third most lis­tened-to Sin­ga­porean artist among Spo­tify’s lo­cal lis­ten­ers last year, says: “I think the Wil­lows have set a huge prece­dent for what the mu­sic in­dus­try can be in the fu­ture and even now.</p>
    <p>“What they’ve left be­hind is some­thing that has re­ally in­spired me and I’ve been learn­ing a lot from Ben.”</p>
    <p>Bet­ter With You is the lat­est in a se­ries of col­lab­o­ra­tions that Tan re­leased last year.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary last year, he put out Be Cool with singer Gareth Fer­nan­dez, fol­lowed by Two Sides, a duet with Char­lie Lim, in April.</p>
    <p>In June, he re­leased Shouldn’t Have To Run with Joie Tan and, in Au­gust, his first Man­darin song, a duet with Tay Kewei ti­tled Don’t You Know Yet?</p>
    <p>He says: “I’ve been a huge fan of Man­darin mu­sic my whole life. I’m not the strong­est in the lan­guage, so it took me a while to find that sweet spot where I felt like I could re­lease a Man­darin song.”</p>
    <p>Kheng, too, has in­ten­tions to sing in Man­darin some day – but ad­mits he has to brush up on the lan­guage first. “I’m afraid I’m not go­ing to get the nu­ances of the lan­guage, so I’ll put out some­thing only when I know (my Man­darin) is strong enough and I’m not go­ing to make a fool of my­self.”</p>
