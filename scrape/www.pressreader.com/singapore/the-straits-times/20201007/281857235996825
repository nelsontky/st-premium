    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam yes­ter­day said there would be “no fur­ther re­lax­ation” of coro­n­avirus mea­sures for the time be­ing, as the au­thor­i­ties con­tinue to find in­fec­tions of un­known ori­gin.</p>
    <p>“We will need to main­tain these mea­sures for some time,” Mrs Lam told a weekly news con­fer­ence be­fore a meet­ing of her ad­vi­sory Ex­ec­u­tive Coun­cil. “In other words, there will in gen­eral be no fur­ther re­lax­ation.”</p>
    <p>Hong Kong has ex­tended out­break con­trol mea­sures for weeks, in­clud­ing lim­it­ing gath­er­ings at no more than four peo­ple, de­spite a sharp de­cline in cases.</p>
    <p>The poli­cies have drawn com­plaints from the hard-hit hos­pi­tal­ity sec­tor, and democ­racy ac­tivists as the re­stric­tions have been used to limit anti-gov­ern­ment protests.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam ar­gued that there was still ev­i­dence of silent pock­ets of in­fec­tion, with more than half of the cases dis­cov­ered since Sept 30 be­ing of un­known ori­gin.</p>
    <p>She did not pro­vide any time frame for lift­ing the out­break con­trol mea­sures, which were set to ex­pire to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Food and Health Sec­re­tary Sophia Chan said yes­ter­day af­ter­noon that the ban on pub­lic gath­er­ings of more than four peo­ple would re­main for at least an­other week, though the gov­ern­ment will al­low team sports in­volv­ing more peo­ple at ice-skat­ing rinks.</p>
    <p>“It was to­tally un­der­stand­able to see many cit­i­zens go out dur­ing the Na­tional Day and Mid-Au­tumn Fes­ti­val long hol­i­days,” Mrs Lam said, re­fer­ring to the pre­vi­ous four-day week­end. “But so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties will still add risks when the epi­demic has not com­pletely ended.”</p>
