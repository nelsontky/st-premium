    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK Pro­fes­sional sports fig­ured out how to sput­ter back to life over the past three months.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) fin­ished its sea­son with LeBron James on top again.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Hockey League (NHL) has a new Stan­ley Cup cham­pion. The Women’s Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion also delivered a ti­tle team.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Foot­ball League (NFL) is charg­ing ahead de­spite a se­ries of pos­i­tive coro­n­avirus tests among some of its 32 teams.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor League Base­ball (MLB) this week will be­come the lat­est elite sports league to pull off the small mir­a­cle of com­plet­ing a sea­son that once looked be­yond hope.</p>
    <p>Against all odds, and with their fi­nan­cial fu­tures threat­ened as never be­fore, the leagues de­ployed ag­gres­sive, rapid-re­sponse test­ing that re­mains out of reach for the gen­eral pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Keep­ing spec­ta­tors out or se­verely lim­it­ing at­ten­dance, they ap­par­ently avoided the calamity of a virus death traced to an event.</p>
    <p>They pushed through, their sched­ules over­lap­ping as never be­fore, as the United States was reel­ing from the pan­demic and pol­i­tics, and was not nec­es­sar­ily watch­ing.</p>
    <p>Now comes the hard part.</p>
    <p>The leagues suc­ceeded be­cause they are enor­mously wealthy.</p>
    <p>They had enough money not just to ad­min­is­ter com­pre­hen­sive test­ing but also to pivot quickly.</p>
    <p>They did things that would have seemed unimag­in­able in the past, like re­lo­cat­ing MLB out­fit Toronto Blue Jays to Buf­falo, New York and clos­ing off hun­dreds of bas­ket­ball and hockey play­ers in bub­ble en­vi­ron­ments in two Cana­dian cities and at Dis­ney World in Florida for two months.</p>
    <p>Now the leagues have to fig­ure out how to do it again as in­fec­tion num­bers have reached a record daily high in the United States, mak­ing it un­clear how to pro­tect play­ers and per­son­nel with­out spend­ing ex­or­bi­tantly again.</p>
    <p>Base­ball re­cently re­leased its 2021 sched­ule with an April 1 open­ing day.</p>
    <p>But com­mis­sioner Rob Man­fred last week es­sen­tially said the sched­ule was lit­tle more than a se­ries of dates on a cal­en­dar.</p>
    <p>“The re­al­ity is all plan­ning for 2021 for us, and for ev­ery other busi­ness in Amer­ica, has to have an as­terisk next to it in terms of what the course of the virus is go­ing to be,” he said on ESPN Ra­dio.</p>
    <p>Re­sort­ing to bub­bles seems un­re­al­is­tic for an en­tire sea­son and go­ing with­out ticket sales and money from over­priced hot dogs, beer, Tshirts and park­ing has pro­duced plenty of deep-red bal­ance sheets.</p>
    <p>The NHL, which should now be in the third week of the 2020-21 sea­son, is tar­get­ing a Jan 1 start date but has yet to post a sched­ule, as the</p>
    <p>US-Cana­dian closed.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, the league an­nounced it was post­pon­ing its Al­lS­tar Game and the Win­ter Clas­sic, an out­door game sched­uled for New Year’s Day.</p>
    <p>The Los An­ge­les Lak­ers won the NBA cham­pi­onship on Oct 11, end­ing a sea­son just weeks be­fore the next one would nor­mally start and league of­fi­cials have yet to say when play will start again.</p>
    <p>“We will re­act to the state-ofthe-art sci­ence,” Dal­las Mav­er­icks owner Mark Cuban said. “I can’t say when, but I can say that what­ever we do, we will do with safety be­ing our top pri­or­ity.”</p>
    <p>Casey Wasser­man, the owner of sports mar­ket­ing and tal­ent firm Wasser­man, which has close re­la­tion­ships with the lead­ers of sev­eral leagues, said he was con­fi­dent the NHL and the NBA would aim to start their sea­sons by early win­ter.</p>
    <p>Next term may con­sist of slightly shorter sched­ules of roughly 70 games, and to com­plete their play­offs in June, as usual, so they can re­turn to nor­mal sched­ules for the 2021-22 sea­son.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor League Soc­cer (MLS) is also con­sid­er­ing start­ing some time in April rather than in early March.</p>
    <p>Where al­lowed, teams will ad­mit spec­ta­tors in lim­ited num­bers, as some NFL and MLB teams have done.</p>
    <p>The Los An­ge­les Dodgers and Tampa Bay Rays are play­ing the World Se­ries at a neu­tral sta­dium in Ar­ling­ton, Texas, that is about 20 per cent full.</p>
    <p>Still, as they so of­ten do, sports</p>
    <p>bor­der</p>
    <p>re­mains</p>
    <p>are serv­ing as a re­flec­tion of so­ci­ety. No one can say when most peo­ple will stop fear­ing large crowds, and the steps to­ward nor­malcy have had set­backs rid­dled with pos­i­tive coro­n­avirus tests.</p>
    <p>Even with pay­ment from me­dia con­tracts, teams and leagues still stand to lose bil­lions with­out fans in seats.</p>
    <p>Spec­ta­tor spend­ing brings in roughly 25 per cent of the NFL’s US$15 bil­lion (S$20.4 bil­lion) in rev­enue, about one-third of base­ball’s rev­enue and roughly 40 per cent of the NBA’s.</p>
    <p>For other sports, such as hockey, foot­ball and ten­nis, the share is sub­stan­tially higher.</p>
    <p>Also, for any num­ber of rea­sons, mil­lions of fans have largely re­jected the ver­sion of pro sports the pan­demic has wrought.</p>
    <p>TV rat­ings plum­meted for nearly ev­ery league – 61 per cent for the Stan­ley Cup play-offs com­pared to last year, 49 per cent for the NBA Fi­nals, and more than 40 per cent for the US Open ten­nis and golf events and for the World Se­ries.</p>
    <p>Rat­ings for the NFL have fallen the least, by 13 per cent.</p>
    <p>Through­out all the ups and downs, con­stant test­ing has been vi­tal. Ev­ery league en­tered a con­tract with a pri­vate lab to per­form multiple Covid-19 tests each week and pro­duce rapid re­sults, usu­ally within 24 hours.</p>
    <p>NFL play­ers are tested and screened for symp­toms ev­ery day. Al­ready the league has con­ducted more than 450,000 tests, and the hand­ful of pos­i­tive cases have come not from the grid­iron but from offthe-field ac­tiv­i­ties like din­ing, ac­cord­ing to the league and the play­ers’ union.</p>
    <p>In MLS, tests oc­cur ev­ery other day and the day be­fore each match.</p>
    <p>“The only way any of this hap­pens is with vig­or­ous test­ing and the pro­to­cols work­ing in tan­dem,” said Ge­orge Atallah, a spokesman for the NFL Play­ers As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“Test­ing alone is not enough. It puts ev­ery­one in the right frame of mind, but also gives a false sense of se­cu­rity. It’s not a ticket to ig­nore the pro­to­cols and do what­ever you want.”</p>
    <p>Agree­ments on test­ing, safety pro­to­cols and pay were cru­cial to per­suad­ing play­ers to re­turn for the 2020 sea­sons, but only the NFL has fig­ured out how to man­age its fi­nances be­yond this year.</p>
    <p>In July, the NFL and the play­ers’ as­so­ci­a­tion agreed to share the fi­nan­cial pain.</p>
    <p>The limit on each team’s player salaries, known as the “salary cap”, is cur­rently US$198.2 mil­lion. It will prob­a­bly drop next year, but it can­not go lower than US$175 mil­lion, with fur­ther ad­just­ments pos­si­ble in fu­ture sea­sons de­pend­ing on how quickly life and pro foot­ball re­turn to nor­mal.</p>
    <p>Other leagues still must find a way to get their play­ers to share the bur­den of lost rev­enue with­out alien­at­ing stars like James, who is sup­posed to make nearly US$40 mil­lion next sea­son.</p>
    <p>Base­ball, which nearly called off its sea­son in July as own­ers and play­ers bick­ered for weeks over pay, may face another bit­ter labour fight dur­ing the win­ter.</p>
    <p>In many ways, the fall­out for the in­dus­try is just be­gin­ning. In a note to in­vestors, Chad Lewis, a se­nior di­rec­tor at Fitch, the rat­ings agency, wrote that “leagues, teams and fa­cil­i­ties took ac­tion by ex­pand­ing bor­row­ing fa­cil­i­ties, draw­ing down on lines of credit, man­ag­ing ex­penses and de­lay­ing cap­i­tal projects”.</p>
    <p>Leagues are con­sid­er­ing loos­en­ing reg­u­la­tions to al­low pri­vate eq­uity funds and other, pub­licly traded fi­nan­cial in­stru­ments to in­vest in teams.</p>
    <p>Steve Horowitz, a prin­ci­pal at In­ner Cir­cle Sports, which spe­cialises in sports fi­nance, noted that “in the pan­demic, val­ues of teams are down across the board be­cause you have lost a tremen­dous amount of rev­enue”.</p>
    <p>Wasser­man re­mains op­ti­mistic. “Ev­ery­one’s in­ter­ests are re­ally aligned here,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Right now, ev­ery­one is just try­ing to grind through the year. In to­tal, it’s 18 months of pain, and sports will be back.”</p>
    <p>AD­HERE TO THE RULES</p>
    <p>The only way any of this hap­pens is with vig­or­ous test­ing and the pro­to­cols work­ing in tan­dem. Test­ing alone is not enough. It puts ev­ery­one in the right frame of mind, but also gives a false sense of se­cu­rity. It’s not a ticket to ig­nore the pro­to­cols and do what­ever you want.</p>
    <p>GE­ORGE ATALLAH, NFL Play­ers As­so­ci­a­tion spokesman, mak­ing his point that test­ing by it­self will not yield an op­ti­mal out­come.</p>
