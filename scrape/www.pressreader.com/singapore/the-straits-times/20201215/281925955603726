    <p>Se­nior cit­i­zens are of­ten vic­tims of scam­mers, who man­age to trick them and gain ac­cess to their bank ac­counts. We are fre­quently told not to dis­close per­sonal bank­ing de­tails.</p>
    <p>We are also told to be care­ful of phish­ing web­sites that re­sem­ble ac­tual bank web­sites.</p>
    <p>Such ad­vi­sories are in­grained in us, and we try our best to look out for such mas­ters of de­cep­tion.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery month, my wife and I re­ceive pay­outs into our joint bank ac­count from the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund Board (CPFB) on the same day, usu­ally be­tween the third and sixth days of each month. The de­scrip­tor ac­com­pa­ny­ing the pay­out has al­ways been “CPF NRIC No. OTHER Pay­ments Col­lec­tions via GIRO”.</p>
    <p>On Dec 2, my wife re­ceived a pay­ment with a long de­scrip­tor which in­cluded “FAST/PayNow Trans­fer OCBC”.</p>
    <p>We were puz­zled and called OCBC be­cause my wife and I do not have OCBC ac­counts.</p>
    <p>We wanted to re­turn the money to the sender. We were afraid that the sender would ac­cuse us of wrong­fully re­tain­ing their monies and ask us to re­turn them with in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>Worse still, we were afraid that scam­mers could be in­volved. We have heard about scam­mers us­ing their vic­tim’s bank ac­count to re­ceive their ill-got­ten monies.</p>
    <p>OCBC was un­able to tell us who sent the money.</p>
    <p>On Dec 3, I re­ceived a pay­ment with the same long de­scrip­tor as my wife’s pay­ment the day be­fore. It was then that we re­alised that the pay­ments were our monthly pay­outs from CPFB, be­cause the amounts were sim­i­lar to pre­vi­ous pay­outs.</p>
    <p>It took many hours on the phone be­fore I was con­nected to a CPFB staff mem­ber who con­firmed that the pay­ments were in­deed our monthly pay­outs. He promised to write to me to ex­plain what had hap­pened.</p>
    <p>I hope CPFB will not cause se­niors un­due stress by do­ing things such as chang­ing the pay­ment de­scrip­tor with­out in­form­ing the re­cip­i­ent be­fore­hand.</p>
