    <p>Mea­sures to limit the spread of Covid-19 among work­ers in the marine sec­tor are be­ing re­viewed by the Gov­ern­ment. This comes af­ter five new in­fec­tions in the com­mu­nity – the high­est num­ber of daily com­mu­nity cases since Aug 30 – linked to the sec­tor were found.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment is re­view­ing pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures for work­ers in the marine sec­tor af­ter five new com­mu­nity Covid-19 pa­tients linked to the sec­tor were an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said it is “ag­gres­sively trac­ing and test­ing the close con­tacts of the com­mu­nity cases so as to ringfence these cases and pre­vent fur­ther trans­mis­sion”.</p>
    <p>Among the five com­mu­nity cases is a fam­ily clus­ter of three in­volv­ing a har­bour pi­lot, who was found to be pos­i­tive for Covid-19 through ros­tered rou­tine test­ing.</p>
    <p>The other two cases from the com­mu­nity are fam­ily mem­bers of a per­ma­nent res­i­dent who works as a marine sur­veyor at Lloyd’s Reg­is­ter Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>His in­fec­tion was an­nounced on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The 46-year-old marine sur­veyor’s work en­tails work­ing on board ves­sels docked at Sem­b­corp Marine Ad­mi­ralty Yard.</p>
    <p>MOH said it will com­mence spe­cial test­ing op­er­a­tions to test peo­ple who had boarded the ships that the har­bour pi­lot and marine sur­veyor re­cently worked on.</p>
    <p>It will also test har­bour pi­lots, marine sur­vey­ors and ship re­pair work­ers in the com­ing days, re­gard­less of their ros­tered rou­tine test­ing sched­ule, to de­ter­mine their Covid-19 sta­tus.</p>
    <p>“In view of the re­cent cases in­volv­ing the marine sec­tor, we will review the need to tighten our pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures for these work­ers,” said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>The review of pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures for work­ers in the marine sec­tor comes af­ter the au­thor­i­ties tight­ened safety mea­sures for air­line crew, fol­low­ing news that a Sin­ga­pore Air­lines cabin crew member and a pi­lot had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The five cases in the com­mu­nity an­nounced yes­ter­day are the high­est daily com­mu­nity fig­ure since Aug 30, when there were eight cases.</p>
    <p>There were also 25 new im­ported coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This means there were 30 new cases yes­ter­day, the high­est daily to­tal since Sept 21, when there were 31 cases.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s new cases take Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,599.</p>
    <p>The 25 were placed on stay­home no­tice or iso­lated on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, said MOH.</p>
    <p>Among them, five are Sin­ga­pore­ans or per­ma­nent res­i­dents, and nine are for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers.</p>
    <p>No new cases from work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries were an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>

        <p data-role="text">The Health Min&#xAD;istry said it will start test&#xAD;ing peo&#xAD;ple who had boarded the ships that the har&#xAD;bour pi&#xAD;lot and marine sur&#xAD;veyor re&#xAD;cently worked on, re&#xAD;gard&#xAD;less of their ros&#xAD;tered rou&#xAD;tine test&#xAD;ing sched&#xAD;ule, to de&#xAD;ter&#xAD;mine their Covid-19 sta&#xAD;tus. Five com&#xAD;mu&#xAD;nity cases in&#xAD;volv&#xAD;ing the two marine sec&#xAD;tor work&#xAD;ers and their fam&#xAD;i&#xAD;lies were an&#xAD;nounced yes&#xAD;ter&#xAD;day.</p>
