    <p>Cell-based seafood pro­ducer Shiok Meats of Sin­ga­pore has re­ceived US$12.6 mil­lion (S$17.3 mil­lion) in Series A fund­ing – the lat­est al­ter­na­tive pro­tein com­pany to raise money as the pan­demic pres­sures global food sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>The new round of fund­ing will sus­tain the start-up for at least three years and help fi­nance re­search, de­vel­op­ment and its first plant in Sin­ga­pore, ac­cord­ing to chief ex­ec­u­tive and co-founder Sand­hya Sri­ram.</p>
    <p>New share­hold­ers in­clude Seeds Cap­i­tal – the in­vest­ment arm of En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore – and sev­eral ven­ture cap­i­tal funds. Te­masek­backed fund Big Idea Ven­tures, which was a seed in­vestor, did not take part in the lat­est round.</p>
    <p>Start-ups and food gi­ants around the world are rac­ing to in­vent and im­prove al­ter­na­tives to tra­di­tional meat pro­duc­tion as con­sumers be­come more care­ful about nu­tri­tion and the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>While fake-meat com­pa­nies such as Im­pos­si­ble Foods and Beyond Meat are rais­ing the lion’s share of fund­ing as they ex­pand into new mar­kets, other start-ups are work­ing on lab-grown al­ter­na­tives for a po­ten­tial pool of cus­tomers that want to eat real meat and seafood that does not come from liv­ing an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>Shiok Meats has raised US$20.2 mil­lion in to­tal fund­ing, and a per­son fa­mil­iar with the fund rais­ing said its post-money val­u­a­tion is about US$50 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>It takes the stem cells from shrimp be­fore mul­ti­ply­ing them in a “cul­ture me­dia”, a so­lu­tion filled with nu­tri­ents. It is an ex­pen­sive prod­uct used to make things like vac­cines and is pri­mar­ily sold by phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal and chem­i­cal com­pa­nies. It is also a key rea­son why</p>
    <p>Shiok’s prawn meat now costs US$3,500 per kilo­gram.</p>
    <p>The start-up is re­search­ing al­ter­na­tive and cheaper plant-based in­gre­di­ents with the goal of bring­ing the cost down to US$50 per kilo­gram in 2022, when its prod­ucts will be sold to busi­nesses like restau­rants.</p>
    <p>Chal­lenges re­main: With­out fi­nal­is­ing the recipe, it can­not l ock down the ex­act in­gre­di­ent sup­pli­ers. And the process of ac­quir­ing biore­ac­tors, the ves­sels in which the shrimp meat will grow, will take a year.</p>
    <p>“We can see so many new play­ers com­ing up,” Dr Sri­ram said of the cell-based meat sec­tor. “The next five years will be about who sur­vives, who makes the cut and who is able to sup­port com­pa­nies like ours make that step over to large-scale man­u­fac­tur­ing.”</p>
