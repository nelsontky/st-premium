    <p>Term 4 is here, ex­am­i­na­tion sea­son is nigh and many par­ents and chil­dren are prob­a­bly feel­ing nervy.</p>
    <p>Ex­pe­ri­enced ed­u­ca­tors ad­vise par­ents to be re­al­is­tic when guid­ing their chil­dren in re­vis­ing for the ex­ams, which take place next month for most pupils. This eases stress for both chil­dren and par­ents, and may even boost their chances of suc­cess.</p>
    <p>Here are some tips for par­ents help­ing their kids pre­pare for the year-end semes­tral as­sess­ment.</p>
    <p>1. SET GOALS TO­GETHER</p>
    <p>In­volv­ing chil­dren in craft­ing a re­vi­sion plan helps par­ents iden­tify their child’s strengths and weak­nesses and helps them aim for achiev­able tar­gets, says Na­tional In­sti­tute of Ed­u­ca­tion lec­turer San­dra Wu.</p>
    <p>“Chil­dren tend to feel stressed when par­ents have high ex­pec­ta­tions of their grades. When they do not meet the grade, they may feel dis­ap­pointed. By set­ting at­tain­able goals with their chil­dren, par­ents are set­ting them up for suc­cess that they can achieve,” she says.</p>
    <p>The col­lab­o­ra­tion helps kids be more accountabl­e for their own progress and take re­spon­si­bil­ity for their stud­ies, she adds.</p>
    <p>2. AVOID AN OVERLY HEC­TIC SCHED­ULE</p>
    <p>The key to a suc­cess­ful re­vi­sion timetable is achiev­ing a bal­ance be­tween one’s stud­ies, rest, meal­times and play.</p>
    <p>“If the child has en­rich­ment or tu­ition classes, th­ese should be fac­tored in, to en­sure that the child does not get over­whelmed by a hec­tic sched­ule,” says Dr Wu.</p>
    <p>She sug­gests us­ing a pie chart to vi­su­alise and or­gan­ise the child’s time and to en­sure he or she has breaks, ide­ally of about 30 min­utes, be­tween study ses­sions.</p>
    <p>A con­ducive study space, ad­e­quate ex­er­cise and good nu­tri­tion are also im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>3. BREAK IT DOWN INTO SMALL STEPS</p>
    <p>To make re­vis­ing a whole year’s work seem less daunt­ing, Mr Goo Yi Xian, founder of on­line learn­ing plat­form OneSanta, sug­gests mak­ing a list of the topics or tasks to be cov­ered and split­ting them fur­ther into smaller tasks.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, in­stead of ask­ing the child to do an en­tire past-year prac­tice pa­per for math­e­mat­ics, con­sider break­ing it down by ask­ing him or her to tackle first Book­let A, then Book­let B, fol­lowed by Pa­per 2.</p>
    <p>Get­ting the child to tick off check­boxes be­side each com­pleted task gives him or her a sense of ac­com­plish­ment and helps par­ents keep track of their child’s re­vi­sion, says Mr Goo.</p>
    <p>4. LET THE CHILD BE THE TEACHER</p>
    <p>To en­sure that chil­dren fully un­der­stand aca­demic con­cepts, get them to play teacher.</p>
    <p>Ms Mon­ica Leong, head of aca­demic panel for on­line learn­ing plat­form Su­per­star Teacher, sug­gests: “Take a few ques­tions from a school work­sheet and ask the child to teach you how to solve the prob­lem.</p>
    <p>“When a child can teach you such that you un­der­stand the topic, he or she has learnt it well.”</p>
    <p>Avoid cor­rect­ing the child while he is in the mid­dle of an ex­pla­na­tion and seek clar­i­fi­ca­tion in­stead.</p>
    <p>Other hacks for par­ents to boost re­vi­sion time in­clude ask­ing the child to look crit­i­cally at in­cor­rect mul­ti­ple-choice an­swers and ex­plain why th­ese were wrong, which can re­in­force learn­ing, she says.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, if the child keeps mak­ing the same mis­takes, par­ents should check whether the child is care­less or does not un­der­stand the con­cept be­ing tested, she says.</p>
    <p>5. WATCH WHAT YOU SAY</p>
    <p>Ex­ams are stress­ful enough and nag­ging is counter-pro­duc­tive.</p>
    <p>OneSanta’s Mr Goo cau­tions: “Par­ents should not scold their chil­dren when they have dif­fi­culty un­der­stand­ing cer­tain con­cepts. This is com­mon as par­ents get frus­trated af­ter ex­plain­ing nu­mer­ous times.</p>
    <p>“View it as an op­por­tu­nity to learn rather than a judg­ment of your child’s abil­ity.”</p>
    <p>Ms Vy­jayan­thi­mala, as­sis­tant direc­tor of the fam­ily divi­sion at Sinda (Sin­ga­pore In­dian De­vel­op­ment As­so­ci­a­tion), says learn­ing should take place reg­u­larly, even if re­vi­sion in­ten­si­fies be­fore ex­ams.</p>
    <p>“Do not wait till the exam pe­riod to pay at­ten­tion to your child’s needs. You shouldn’t have con­ver­sa­tions cen­tred only on ex­ams; nei­ther should you dwell on pre­vi­ous poor re­sults or fo­cus only on grades. Fo­cus on the sup­port he or she re­quires.”</p>
    <p>Praise and en­cour­age­ment, when the child demon­strates good char­ac­ter traits or shows ef­fort in his or her learn­ing, go a long way.</p>
