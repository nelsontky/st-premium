    <p>UNITED NA­TIONS • Af­ter years of shift­ing the Philip­pines closer to China, Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte ap­pears to be lean­ing back to­wards the United States.</p>
    <p>The 75-year-old leader on Tues­day gave his most force­ful de­fence yet of a 2016 ar­bi­tra­tion rul­ing in favour of the Philip­pines that said Bei­jing’s ex­pan­sive ter­ri­to­rial claims in the South China Sea breached in­ter­na­tional law.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing the United Na­tions Gen­eral Assem­bly, Mr Duterte said the de­ci­sion “is now part of in­ter­na­tional law, be­yond com­pro­mise and be­yond the reach of pass­ing gov­ern­ments to di­lute, di­min­ish or aban­don”, adding: “We firmly re­ject at­tempts to un­der­mine it.” He did not, how­ever, name China.</p>
    <p>“We wel­come the in­creas­ing num­ber of states that have come in sup­port of the award and what it stands for – the tri­umph of rea­son over rash­ness, of law over dis­or­der, of amity over am­bi­tion.”</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte had re­sisted rais­ing the is­sue of the tri­bunal rul­ing af­ter he took power in 2016, em­brac­ing closer ties with China while an­nounc­ing a “sep­a­ra­tion” from the US – his coun­try’s big­gest mil­i­tary ally for decades.</p>
    <p>But in re­cent months, his government has started to shift back to­wards Amer­ica, which re­mains widely pop­u­lar among Filipinos, as Bei­jing has in­creased its as­sertive­ness in the South China Sea and the Philip­pine econ­omy suf­fers due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>There is now “more space for those crit­i­cal of China to be heard and to have in­flu­ence”, said Dr Mal­colm Cook, vis­it­ing se­nior fel­low at the ISEAS-Yu­sof Ishak In­sti­tute in Sin­ga­pore and co­or­di­na­tor of its Philip­pines pro­ject, adding that of­fi­cials known to be more hawk­ish on China have stepped to the fore while Mr Duterte has di­alled back on anti-US rhetoric.</p>
    <p>“The weights on the bal­ance of Philip­pine for­eign pol­icy for good re­la­tions with the US and good re­la­tions with China have shifted this year in favour of the US.”</p>
    <p>In June, the Philip­pines sus­pended its de­ci­sion to end a 22-year-old deal fa­cil­i­tat­ing joint mil­i­tary ex­er­cises with the US while start­ing to raise crit­i­cism of China’s moves in dis­puted wa­ters. And Mr Duterte this month par­doned a US marine found guilty in 2015 of killing a trans­gen­der Filip­ina.</p>
    <p>This week, Manila wel­comed the US and other na­tions to play a role in main­tain­ing se­cu­rity in the South China Sea, fol­low­ing a sim­i­lar state­ment from Viet­nam. China has ac­cused the US of in­ter­ven­ing in ter­ri­to­rial dis­putes and called it “the big­gest driver of mil­i­tari­sa­tion of the South China Sea”.</p>
    <p>“I can swear to you, West­ern pow­ers will be in the South China Sea,” For­eign Sec­re­tary Teodoro Loc­sin told law­mak­ers on Mon­day. “We be­lieve in the bal­ance of power, that the free­dom of the Filipino peo­ple de­pends on the bal­ance of power in the South China Sea.”</p>
    <p>Philip­pine of­fi­cials have framed the re­cent moves as a re­flec­tion of the coun­try’s in­de­pen­dent for­eign pol­icy more than sid­ing with one par­tic­u­lar camp. The US al­liance with the Philip­pines is its old­est in the re­gion, with a mu­tual de­fence treaty signed in 1951 stip­u­lat­ing that ei­ther na­tion will re­spond mil­i­tar­ily in the event of an at­tack on the other.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte “up­holds the Philip­pine national in­ter­est and no other coun­try’s in­ter­est”, pres­i­den­tial spokesman Harry Roque said in a text mes­sage. Ear­lier this month, Mr Roque told re­porters that Mr Duterte may have par­doned the US marine to curry favour with Washington in an ef­fort to gain ac­cess to coro­n­avirus vac­cines.</p>
    <p>The quest to se­cure a vac­cine shows that Mr Duterte is not aban­don­ing Bei­jing: He said this month he would pri­ori­tise China and Rus­sia in sourc­ing a Covid-19 vac­cine over West­ern drug­mak­ers, which re­quire cash ad­vances in ex­change for sup­plies. The Philip­pines has been hit with the most in­fec­tions in South-east Asia with more than 294,000 known cases, and its econ­omy is pro­jected to fall by as much as 6.6 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte is “hedg­ing his bets more at a time when he wants to keep sev­eral op­tions open for ac­cess to vac­cine and the Philip­pines is com­ing un­der more pres­sure from China in the South China Sea”, said Mr Peter Mum­ford, South-east & South Asia prac­tice head at risk con­sul­tancy Eura­sia Group.</p>
    <p>“Duterte is ide­o­log­i­cally more drawn to China than he is the US, but his for­eign pol­icy is also driven by po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic prag­ma­tism.”</p>
