    <p>SYD­NEY • Five al­leged mem­bers of an Aus­tralia-based crime ring have been charged af­ter hun­dreds of kilo­grams of co­caine were dis­cov­ered in a plane that crashed af­ter take-off in Pa­pua New Guinea, the po­lice said last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Fed­eral Po­lice al­lege that greed played a big part in the syndicate’s ac­tiv­i­ties, and they can­not rule out that the weight of the co­caine had an im­pact on the plane’s abil­ity to take off.</p>
    <p>The five, all de­scribed as mem­bers of a Mel­bourne-based crim­i­nal syndicate with al­leged links to Ital­ian or­gan­ised crime, were charged with con­spir­ing to im­port 500kg of co­caine worth some A$80 mil­lion (S$78 mil­lion) and other re­lated crimes, the po­lice said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The July 26 crash oc­curred as the drug-laden plane at­tempted to take off from a re­mote airstrip in Papa Lea Lea, about 30km north of Pa­pua New Guinea’s cap­i­tal of Port Moresby, en route to Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>The co­caine stash, which the po­lice said was “the equiv­a­lent of about 500,000 street deals”, was dis­cov­ered late on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The five peo­ple ar­rested, who were not on the flight but were im­pli­cated in the smug­gling op­er­a­tion, were de­tained in Queens­land and Vic­to­ria af­ter the Cessna model light air­craft left Ma­reeba Air­port in Aus­tralia on July 26 for its mis­sion to Pa­pua New Guinea. They face a max­i­mum penalty of life in pri­son if con­victed.</p>
