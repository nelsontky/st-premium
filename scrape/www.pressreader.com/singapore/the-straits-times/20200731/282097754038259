    <p>Bank lend­ing in Sin­ga­pore shrank 0.7 per cent last month from a month ago as loans to busi­nesses con­tin­ued to de­cline, though there were signs of a pick-up in con­sumer lend­ing with the lift­ing of cir­cuit breaker mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Loans through the do­mes­tic bank­ing unit – which cap­tures lend­ing in all cur­ren­cies but re­flects mainly Sin­ga­pore-dol­lar lend­ing – stood at $680.36 bil­lion last month, com­pared with $685.26 bil­lion in May, ac­cord­ing to pre­lim­i­nary data from the Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This marks the fourth con­sec­u­tive month that bank lend­ing has dropped amid the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>On a year-on-year ba­sis, to­tal lend­ing last month was down about 1 per cent from $687.08 bil­lion in June last year.</p>
    <p>To­tal busi­ness l oans fell 1.1 per cent to $425.85 bil­lion last month from a month ago.</p>
    <p>They were dragged down by loans to fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions, which con­tin­ued to de­cline, fall­ing 1.3 per cent to $102.24 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Also drop­ping were loans to firms in gen­eral com­merce and in trans­port, stor­age and com­mu­ni­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, loans to build­ing and con­struc­tion firms rose again month on month, c l i mb i n g 1 per cent to $148.06 bil­lion, while lend­ing to man­u­fac­tur­ers also in­creased by 1 per cent, to $29.1 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the slump in con­sumer loans, which be­gan in Fe­bru­ary, eased last month, with lend­ing down just 0.05 per cent, to $254.51 bil­lion, from a month ago.</p>
    <p>Credit card lend­ing – which plunged dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod from the clo­sure of re­tail and food and bev­er­age out­lets, and from travel re­stric­tions – rose to $9.45 bil­lion last month.</p>
    <p>This is 2.9 per cent higher than May, but still 17 per cent lower than in June last year.</p>
    <p>Car loans, how­ever, con­tin­ued to drop and were down 2 per cent month on month to $8.32 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>This is 7.5 per cent lower than a year ago.</p>
    <p>Hous­ing loans, which make up three-quar­ters of con­sumer loans, con­tin­ued to weaken amid eco­nomic gloom, job un­cer­tainty, and re­stric­tions on home view­ing. They dipped an­other 0.1 per cent to $199.52 bil­lion last month.</p>
