    <p>SEOUL • South Korea will ex­pand a ban on pri­vate gath­er­ings of larger than four peo­ple to in­clude the whole coun­try, and ex­tend un­prece­dented so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules in Seoul and neigh­bour­ing ar­eas un­til Jan 17, the health min­is­ter said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Kwon Deok-cheol told a brief­ing that the mea­sures were nec­es­sary to re­duce a pro­longed surge in in­fec­tions that has led to a spike in deaths.</p>
    <p>The coun­try re­ported 824 new cases on Fri­day, down from 1,029 a day be­fore, a drop that of­fi­cials said was likely due to less test­ing over the New Year hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>As many as 40 per cent of re­cent cases have been linked to small gath­er­ings, Mr Kwon said.</p>
    <p>The Seoul met­ro­pol­i­tan area will be placed un­der the se­cond-high­est Level 2.5 so­cial dis­tanc­ing guide­lines for two more weeks un­til Jan 17, ac­cord­ing to the Cen­tral Dis­as­ter and Safety Coun­ter­mea­sure Head­quar­ters.</p>
    <p>The ban on pri­vate gath­er­ings had been im­posed in Seoul and neigh­bour­ing ar­eas be­fore the Christ­mas hol­i­day, and had been due to ex­pire to­day.</p>
    <p>The coun­try also has re­stric­tions on churches, restau­rants, cafes, ski re­sorts and other venues.</p>
    <p>Mr Kwon apol­o­gised to cit­i­zens for hav­ing to main­tain the rules, but thanked them for their sol­i­dar­ity and co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Given plans to be­gin vac­ci­na­tions around Fe­bru­ary, the next few months will be the “last hur­dle”, he said.</p>
    <p>Af­ter ini­tial suc­cess in sub­du­ing ear­lier waves of in­fec­tions, South Korea has strug­gled to re­duce this lat­est and largest surge, with daily cases hov­er­ing around 1,000 for weeks.</p>
    <p>More than 4.21 mil­lion Covid-19 tests have been con­ducted since Jan 3 last year.</p>
    <p>Mass clus­ter in­fec­tions have con­tin­ued to be re­ported from el­der­care fa­cil­i­ties and pri­vate gath­er­ings, with hun­dreds of cases and deaths found just last month.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment has also faced crit­i­cism for its sluggish re­sponse to mass clus­ter in­fec­tions at a cor­rec­tional fa­cil­ity in Songpa-gu, south­ern Seoul, where more than 800 Covid-19 cases had been re­ported by last Wed­nes­day.</p>
