    <p>In­vestors dream of dis­cov­er­ing the “next big thing”. The next decade will favour dis­rup­tors in sec­tors un­der­go­ing tech­no­log­i­cal trans­for­ma­tion, with fin­tech, healthtech and greentech of­fer­ing prom­ise of strong growth, says Ms Tan Min Lan, Asia-Pa­cific head of UBS Global Wealth Man­age­ment’s chief in­vest­ment of­fice.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery investor dreams of dis­cov­er­ing the “next big thing” that leads to life-chang­ing fi­nan­cial gains. Imag­ine in­vest­ing in Ap­ple be­fore the iPhone was in­vented and went on to change the world, or buy­ing into Ama­zon be­fore e-com­merce was trans­formed and on­line shop­ping be­came a way of life.</p>
    <p>Look­ing back, each decade has a mar­ket-defin­ing devel­op­ment: the pro­lif­er­a­tion of per­sonal com­put­ers in the 1980s, a cap­i­tal spend­ing boom in the 1990s, the com­mod­ity su­per-cy­cle in the 2000s, and the surge of smart­phones and e-com­merce in the 2010s.</p>
    <p>Time and again, dis­rup­tive in­no­va­tions have up­ended in­dus­try in­cum­bents, driven ef­fi­ciency gains and gobbled sig­nif­i­cant mar­ket shares.</p>
    <p>Iden­ti­fy­ing the next big thing is no easy feat, but the most en­dur­ing in­vest­ment gains have been seen in in­dus­tries where pen­e­tra­tion rates start low and grow ex­po­nen­tially, in turn, al­low­ing for long run­ways for growth ahead.</p>
    <p>A case in point is the jump in global smart­phone pen­e­tra­tion from 9 per cent in 2010 to 80 per cent last year, while e-com­merce climbed from 4 per cent to 15 per cent. In turn, prof­its have soared – by over 36 times for the likes of Ama­zon Web Ser­vices since 2014.</p>
    <p>So where could the next big thing come from?</p>
    <p>The next decade will likely re­ward in­vest­ing in com­pa­nies that use tech­nol­ogy to dis­rupt other sec­tors, in par­tic­u­lar within the spa­ces of fin­tech, healthtech and greentech, which are, in turn, en­abled and ac­cel­er­ated by the global roll-out of 5G tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>5G – THE UL­TI­MATE EN­ABLER</p>
    <p>Each mo­bile up­grade changes the way we use and enjoy tech­nol­ogy. Stream­ing high-qual­ity videos or mak­ing video calls, brows­ing without in­ter­rup­tion and play­ing real-time mo­bile games were made pos­si­ble only with 4G. The tech­nol­ogy has played a key role in boost­ing the growth of the smart­phone in­dus­try, so­cial me­dia plat­forms and stream­ing ser­vices.</p>
    <p>5G, with down­load speeds of 20GB/sec and la­tency of just 1 to 4 mil­lisec­onds (ver­sus 1GB/sec and 40 to 60 mil­lisec­onds for 4G), will likely drive an even big­ger change, en­abling a whole new se­ries of ap­pli­ca­tions that will trans­form the decade ahead.</p>
    <p>A study con­ducted by IHS Markit es­ti­mated that about US$13.2 tril­lion (S$17.4 tril­lion) worth of eco­nomic value could be gen­er­ated from 5G ap­pli­ca­tions by 2035.</p>
    <p>With 5G roll-outs planned around the world, a global wave of 5G-re­lated spend­ing is gain­ing mo­men­tum and set to wash over the econ­omy, ben­e­fit­ing com­pa­nies that man­u­fac­ture, in­stall and main­tain the equip­ment, as well as smart­phone man­u­fac­tur­ers.</p>
    <p>Crit­i­cally, the next big thing will likely emerge from a new gen­er­a­tion of plat­form lead­ers build­ing 5G use cases, in ar­eas such as au­ton­o­mous driv­ing, aug­mented and vir­tual re­al­ity, In­dus­trial In­ter­net of Things and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI).</p>
    <p>FIN­TECH – DIS­RUPT­ING A MIL­LEN­NIA-OLD IN­STI­TU­TION</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has trig­gered a dra­matic shift to­wards con­tact­less and mo­bile pay­ments. On the back of world­wide lock­downs, fin­tech pay­ment firms have seen a surge in vol­umes and cus­tomer ac­qui­si­tions.</p>
    <p>Once hooked on pay­ing elec­tron­i­cally, many are un­likely to re­vert to the old ways.</p>
    <p>This sticky user base is a good op­por­tu­nity for fin­tech firms to cross-sell across dif­fer­ent prod­ucts and ser­vices.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to dig­i­tal pay­ments growth, en­abling tech­nolo­gies like AI are help­ing fin­tech ex­pand into other ar­eas like in­sur­ance (in­surtech), prop­erty (proptech), lend­ing and in­vest­ments – busi­ness seg­ments with not only stronger growth rates, but also higher mar­gins.</p>
    <p>The launch of cen­tral bank dig­i­tal cur­ren­cies could fur­ther pro­pel fin­tech adop­tion, over­all mak­ing the in­dus­try one of the fastest-grow­ing glob­ally in the decade ahead.</p>
    <p>HEALTHTECH – A NEW AGE IN MED­I­CAL TREAT­MENT</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has si­mul­ta­ne­ously in­creased pa­tient fo­cus on health out­comes, and re­duced peo­ple’s abil­ity to ac­cess care and gov­ern­ments’ ca­pac­ity to pay for that care.</p>
    <p>And with the global over-65 pop­u­la­tion ex­pected to grow 60 per cent to one bil­lion by 2030, ac­cord­ing to the United Na­tions, global health­care spend­ing is set to in­crease sub­stan­tially.</p>
    <p>Health tech­nol­ogy will likely play a crit­i­cal role in im­prov­ing the ef­fi­ciency and qual­ity of health­care while keep­ing costs down.</p>
    <p>Un­like be­fore, health­care will in­creas­ingly be trans­formed from an episodic ser­vice into a life­long process of man­ag­ing and main­tain­ing health, driven by tech­no­log­i­cally savvy health con­sumers.</p>
    <p>Three main ar­eas of emer­gent tech­nolo­gies – telemedici­ne, trans­for­ma­tive treat­ments and ad­vanced di­ag­nos­tics – are set for ex­po­nen­tial growth in the global push to­wards a more ef­fi­cient and holis­tic health­care sys­tem.</p>
    <p>In China alone, for in­stance, we ex­pect the telemedici­ne mar­ket to grow 50 per cent a year from last year to 2023.</p>
    <p>GREENTECH – GREEN IS THE NEW GOLD</p>
    <p>Last year was a wa­ter­shed year for global cli­mate pol­icy. The green trans­for­ma­tion of some of the world’s big­gest in­dus­tries is just be­gin­ning.</p>
    <p>To hit car­bon-neu­tral tar­gets, gov­ern­ment reg­u­la­tions, in­vest­ment and sub­si­dies will likely be geared to­wards in­cen­tivis­ing four main goals: re­plac­ing fos­sil-fu­elled power gen­er­a­tion, and build­ing heat­ing and cool­ing with re­new­able en­ergy; swop­ping fos­sil-fu­elled trans­port for elec­tric ve­hi­cles (EVs); switch­ing from in­dus­trial ap­pli­ca­tions us­ing gas to ones pow­ered by green hy­dro­gen; and us­ing dig­i­tal so­lu­tions to im­prove ef­fi­ciency.</p>
    <p>This means heavy in­vest­ment in re­new­able en­ergy such as wind and so­lar, which favours de­vel­op­ers and man­u­fac­tur­ers across the re­new­able value chain.</p>
    <p>It also means that EV au­to­mo­bile</p>
    <p>lead­ers and bat­tery mak­ers, in­clud­ing those that sup­ply the nec­es­sary parts, are likely in for a spend­ing wind­fall over the next decade.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, new en­ergy sources like hy­dro­gen are at­tract­ing new-found at­ten­tion and could one day be­come as wide­spread as gas-pow­ered en­gines.</p>
    <p>HOW TO IN­VEST</p>
    <p>If the last decade was about in­vest­ing in the tech­nol­ogy sec­tor it­self, the next decade will likely favour dis­rup­tors in sec­tors un­der­go­ing tech­no­log­i­cal trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Fin­tech, healthtech and greentech pro­vide ex­po­sure to just that – tech­nolo­gies that are ca­pa­ble of dis­rupt­ing en­tire in­dus­tries – and of­fer the prom­ise of strong growth, given that their pen­e­tra­tion rates are still in the sin­gle dig­its.</p>
    <p>So, as it’s un­cer­tain how that dis­rup­tion will un­fold, we rec­om­mend cast­ing a net across these themes poised to boom in the decade ahead.</p>
    <p>In­vestors should di­ver­sify among com­pa­nies and fo­cus on the mid-cap lead­ers push­ing the bound­aries in their re­spec­tive fields.</p>
    <p>Do­ing so may one day reel in the big­gest catch of the decade.</p>
