    <p>SIN­GA­PORE/LON­DON • One of two Mus­lims al­lowed to run for the rul­ing party i n Bud­dhist-ma­jor­ity Myan­mar’s gen­eral elec­tion to­mor­row, Mr Sithu Maung, wor­ries that fake news on Face­book could dam­age his chances.</p>
    <p>Within a tor­rent of racist abuse and mis­in­for­ma­tion posted about him ahead of the polls are false claims that he plans to close Bud­dhist monas­tic schools and to ad­vo­cate the teach­ing of Ara­bic.</p>
    <p>“They use race and re­li­gion to at­tack me,” the 33-year-old told Reuters in the com­mer­cial cap­i­tal of Yan­gon, where he is stand­ing for a seat won by the rul­ing party in the last elec­tion. “These days, peo­ple use so­cial me­dia more than ever... and when they see false in­for­ma­tion 10 times, it be­comes the truth.”</p>
    <p>So­cial me­dia com­pa­nies face a global chal­lenge to stop dis­in­for­ma­tion on elec­tions, in­clud­ing the 2020 United States elec­tion.</p>
    <p>In Myan­mar, the stakes for Face­book are par­tic­u­larly high af­ter pre­vi­ous ac­cu­sa­tions that it helped in­cite geno­cide.</p>
    <p>Half of Myan­mar’s 53 mil­lion peo­ple use Face­book, which for many is syn­ony­mous with the In­ter­net. Face­book ex­ec­u­tives told Reuters hate speech in Myan­mar was “near his­toric lows” af­ter it in­vested in re­sources from ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence lan­guage and photo de­tec­tion to mea­sures to slow the spread of vi­ral con­tent. But civil so­ci­ety groups have found dozens of net­works of ac­counts, pages, and groups spread­ing eth­ni­cally and re­li­giously charged false­hoods that they fear could lead to strife and un­der­mine the sec­ond elec­tion since the end of hard-line army rule in 2011.</p>
    <p>Reuters sep­a­rately found more than two dozen in­ter-con­nected pages and ac­counts with a com­bined reach in the hun­dreds of thou­sands. The ma­jor­ity were re­moved af­ter Reuters flagged them to Face­book.</p>
    <p>“There’s a short-term im­me­di­ate con­cern of all this dis­in­for­ma­tion and hate speech fu­elling re­al­world vi­o­lence,” said Mr Jes Kaliebe Petersen, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of tech hub Phan­dee­yar, part of the Myan­mar Tech Ac­count­abil­ity Net­work, a civil so­ci­ety group co­or­di­nat­ing ef­forts to re­duce risks posed by so­cial me­dia. Harm­ful con­tent, he said, is “spread­ing like wildfire”.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment of leader Aung San Suu Kyi, her rul­ing Na­tional League for Democ­racy and the elec­tion com­mis­sion did not re­spond to re­quests for com­ment. Al­though the NLD is widely ex­pected to win the elec­tion eas­ily, as it did in 2015, there is prece­dent for so­cial me­dia hate speech lead­ing to vi­o­lence in Myan­mar.</p>
    <p>Anti-Mus­lim ru­mours on Face­book were widely seen as help­ing to trig­ger deadly ri­ots in 2012 and 2014. In 2017, vi­o­lent speech on Face­book was blamed for sup­port­ing an army crack­down on Ro­hingya Mus­lims that drove more than 730,000 to flee Myan­mar. But Mr Rafael Frankel, Face­book’s di­rec­tor of public pol­icy for South-east Asia, told Reuters ahead of the elec­tion: “What we have seen so far is typ­i­cal and noth­ing in any way out of the or­di­nary from what we would see in other parts of the world when an elec­tion is hap­pen­ing.”</p>
    <p>Even be­fore cam­paign­ing got un­der way, Face­book deleted 280,000 items in Myan­mar for hate speech in the sec­ond quar­ter of the year, up from 51,000 in the first quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, it is ver­i­fy­ing ac­counts for some politi­cians – in­clud­ing Mr Sithu Maung – and giv­ing them a di­rect line for com­plaints. Face­book also said it had taken down hun­dreds of ac­counts for “co­or­di­nated in­au­then­tic be­hav­iour” in­clud­ing about 70 it traced to mem­bers of Myan­mar’s mil­i­tary on Oct 8.</p>
