    <p>• At 36, Thi­ago Silva will not be able to play ev­ery game for Chelsea this sea­son, with man­ager Frank Lam­pard keen to man­age his work­load.</p>
    <p>The for­mer Paris Saint-Ger­main cap­tain, signed on a free trans­fer dur­ing the trans­fer win­dow, will re­turn for to­day’s Premier League visit to Burn­ley.</p>
    <p>The Brazil­ian was rested as the Blues beat Krasnodar away in their mid­week Champions League match and, al­though he is one of the first names on Lam­pard’s teamsheet, the club want to keep the de­fender wrapped in cot­ton wool.</p>
    <p>At his pre-match vir­tual press con­fer­ence ahead of their trip to Turf Moor, he said: “Thi­ago is fit. Tak­ing him out of Rus­sia was a main­te­nance is­sue.</p>
    <p>“He could have played if he had to but we had to put it in con­text of what is ahead of us. I’m mak­ing sure we get the best out of him to­wards the end of the sea­son.”</p>
    <p>Lam­pard also re­ported no fresh in­juries, but added his squad were slightly fa­tigued af­ter their long trip to Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>Hakim Ziyech has made just two sub­sti­tute ap­pear­ances in the Premier League this sea­son be­cause of in­jury, but looks set for his first league start to­day af­ter bag­ging his first goal for his new club against Krasnodar.</p>
    <p>On the Moroc­can winger, who ar­rived i n the sum­mer for €40 mil­lion (S$63.7 mil­lion) from Ajax, Lam­pard said: “Hakim was very good, a big plus.</p>
    <p>“We need op­tions. We’re also search­ing for re­la­tion­ships as newer play­ers are learn­ing about each other and how we play. There will be rotation at times. We need ev­ery­body.”</p>
