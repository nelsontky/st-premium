    <p>The fu­ture of Hous­ing Board (HDB) liv­ing will see smart fit­tings that give home own­ers the op­tion of not only mon­i­tor­ing en­ergy con­sump­tion and con­trol­ling smart ap­pli­ances, but also di­rec­tional sig­nage with larger fonts and pic­to­rial sym­bols. This is to en­sure smart and sus­tain­able liv­ing will keep pace with Sin­ga­pore’s age­ing pop­u­la­tion, said Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat.</p>
    <p>The fu­ture of Hous­ing Board (HDB) liv­ing will see smart fit­tings that give home own­ers the op­tion of not only mon­i­tor­ing en­ergy con­sump­tion and con­trol­ling smart ap­pli­ances, but also di­rec­tional sig­nage with larger fonts and pic­to­rial sym­bols.</p>
    <p>This is to en­sure smart and sus­tain­able liv­ing will keep pace with Sin­ga­pore’s age­ing pop­u­la­tion, said Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat.</p>
    <p>He added that a peo­ple-cen­tric ap­proach that an­tic­i­pates the phys­i­cal, so­cial and men­tal well-be­ing of res­i­dents is core to HDB’s plan for im­prov­ing the liv­ing en­vi­ron­ment, even as it re­alises Sin­ga­pore’s vi­sion of be­com­ing a smart nation.</p>
    <p>In a HDB we­bi­nar yes­ter­day, Mr Heng laid out a new blue­print that will guide the plan­ning of HDB towns and flats for the next decade or so, in both new pub­lic hous­ing de­vel­op­ments and ex­ist­ing towns.</p>
    <p>Called De­sign­ing for Life, the new HDB roadmap is an­chored by three pil­lars: Live Well, which en­hances the health and well-be­ing of res­i­dents through the built en­vi­ron­ment; Live Smart, which in­cor­po­rates smart and sus­tain­able tech­nolo­gies; and Live Con­nected, which fo­cuses on com­mu­nity par­tic­i­pa­tion in the shap­ing of pub­lic spa­ces.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said the roadmap is timely, as the Covid-19 pan­demic has made Sin­ga­pore­ans view their home in a new light.</p>
    <p>“For many, home has be­come a sanc­tu­ary from the pan­demic. For some, home is in­creas­ingly a space for work. For all, home is where we bond with our loved ones,” he said.</p>
    <p>The pre­vi­ous roadmap was in­tro­duced in 2011 and im­ple­mented in towns such as Pung­gol and Bi­dadari.</p>
    <p>An up­com­ing hous­ing de­vel­op­ment that will show­case the fea­tures un­der the new roadmap is Parc Res­i­dences @ Ten­gah, a Build-To-Or­der (BTO) project launched in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>A yet-to-be-named ad­ja­cent BTO project, which will be launched at a later date, will share the ameni­ties. Both are lo­cated in Park dis­trict, one of five hous­ing dis­tricts in the “for­est town” of Ten­gah.</p>
    <p>The 2,200 flats in both de­vel­op­ments will be in­te­grated with child­care cen­tres, a Res­i­dents’ Com­mit­tee cen­tre and other fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The nearby neigh­bour­hood cen­tre will be in­te­grated with a poly­clinic for easy ac­cess to care fa­cil­i­ties for both the young and old.</p>
    <p>In­te­grated de­vel­op­ments such as Kam­pung Ad­mi­ralty in Wood­lands and Oa­sis Ter­races in Pung­gol will be more com­mon, said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the Be­dok South Hori­zon BTO project will be in­te­grated with the Siglap Com­mu­nity Cen­tre and care fa­cil­i­ties for se­niors. It will be ready next year.</p>
    <p>To nur­ture a kam­pung spirit, HDB will seek res­i­dents’ sug­ges­tions to de­sign and build their pre­ferred shared spa­ces such as void decks. HDB said it will pi­lot this next year in se­lected BTO projects in Tampines and Daw­son.</p>
    <p>Smart tech­nolo­gies will also fea­ture in new flats in Ten­gah.</p>
    <p>Home own­ers can sub­scribe to an en­ergy-ef­fi­cient cen­tralised cool­ing sys­tem and mon­i­tor their us­age via an app, po­ten­tially sav­ing up to 30 per cent in life cy­cle costs.</p>
    <p>Up to 10 per cent of carpark lots will fea­ture in­fra­struc­ture for elec­tric ve­hi­cles (EV). The elec­tric load needed by the EV charg­ing will be sup­ple­mented by the so­lar en­ergy col­lected via so­lar pho­to­voltaic pan­els on the rooftops of nearby blocks.</p>
    <p>Green fea­tures in­clud­ing so­lar pan­els will be rolled out to ex­ist­ing towns un­der a 10-year HDB Green Towns pro­gramme, which aims to make ev­ery town in Sin­ga­pore more sus­tain­able and live­able by 2030.</p>
    <p>HDB chief ex­ec­u­tive Cheong Koon Hean said one of HDB’s key fo­cal ar­eas in driv­ing na­tional sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment ef­forts is so­lar en­ergy, with 70 per cent of all HDB blocks fit­ted with or iden­ti­fied for so­lar in­stal­la­tion y 2030.</p>
    <p>“Over the past decade, we have ush­ered in a new gen­er­a­tion of pub­lic hous­ing, with sig­nif­i­cant shifts to­wards well-de­signed, sus­tain­able and com­mu­nity-cen­tric towns that har­ness both the power of na­ture and smart tech­nolo­gies,” she said.</p>
