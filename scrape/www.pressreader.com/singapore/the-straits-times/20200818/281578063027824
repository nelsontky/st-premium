    <p>Malaysia’s state of Sabah will hold state assem­bly elec­tions on Sept 26, the Elec­tion Com­mis­sion said yes­ter­day, amid an on­go­ing le­gal chal­lenge on the va­lid­ity of the assem­bly’s dis­so­lu­tion. Nom­i­na­tions for can­di­dates for the 73 seats will take place on Sept 12, pro­vid­ing for a 14-day cam­paign­ing pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s east­ern­most state of Sabah will hold state assem­bly elec­tions on Sept 26, the Elec­tion Com­mis­sion said yes­ter­day, amid an on­go­ing le­gal chal­lenge on the va­lid­ity of the assem­bly’s dis­so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>The com­mis­sion’s act­ing chair­man Azmi Sharom said nom­i­na­tions for can­di­dates for 73 state assem­bly seats in Sabah will take place on Sept 12. There will be a 14-day cam­paign­ing pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The com­mis­sion said it will pro­ceed with pre­par­ing for elec­tions, de­spite an on­go­ing court chal­lenge pur­sued by former chief min­is­ter Musa Aman. He is at­tempt­ing to have the July 30 dis­so­lu­tion by Sabah Gover­nor Juhar Mahirud­din de­clared in­valid.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Musa had at­tempted to take over the state govern­ment with the de­fec­tions of at least 13 state law­mak­ers, but his move was foiled when Tun Juhar con­sented to dis­solve the leg­is­la­ture.</p>
    <p>The High Court in Kota Kin­a­balu, the Sabah cap­i­tal, is sched­uled to de­cide on whether the case has merits only on Fri­day. “We have not re­ceived any or­der (on the court case), so we will con­tinue with our prepa­ra­tions,” Dr Azmi said at a press con­fer­ence in Kota Kin­a­balu yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Around 1.1 mil­lion vot­ers are el­i­gi­ble to take part in the statewide elec­tions, ac­cord­ing to the lat­est gazette of the elec­toral roll. Sabah, Malaysia’s sec­ond-largest state by land size af­ter Sarawak, has a pop­u­la­tion of 3.5 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The state polls are ex­pected to be a crowded af­fair, with both Sabah­based par­ties and na­tional par­ties from Penin­su­lar Malaysia tak­ing part. It will be the first ma­jor elec­toral bat­tle since the Perikatan Na­sional (PN) al­liance, led by Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin, formed the fed­eral govern­ment five months ago, fol­low­ing de­fec­tions that caused the col­lapse of the Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>In­cum­bent Sabah Chief Min­is­ter Shafie Ap­dal will lead his Parti Warisan Sabah, along with his PH al­lies, into bat­tle, while Mr Musa is largely ex­pected to lead the PN charge in Sabah.</p>
    <p>Mr Musa’s younger brother, former fed­eral min­is­ter Ani­fah Aman, has also thrown his hat into the ring, an­nounc­ing that his new Parti Cinta Sabah, which is not aligned with ei­ther camp, will con­test more than half of the 73 state seats.</p>
    <p>Both Mr Musa and Datuk Seri Ani­fah are former Umno chief­tains.</p>
    <p>The 2018 elec­tions saw Datuk Seri Shafie and Mr Musa, who was then in­cum­bent chief min­is­ter, win­ning 29 seats each in the then 60-strong assem­bly.</p>
    <p>But Mr Shafie ul­ti­mately man­aged to form the state govern­ment af­ter se­cur­ing sev­eral de­fec­tions from Mr Musa’s camp.</p>
    <p>Mr Musa last month mounted a come­back af­ter he was ac­quit­ted of corruption charges this year, and sub­se­quently se­cured enough de­fec­tions to gain a sim­ple ma­jor­ity in the state assem­bly.</p>
    <p>Sabah would have been the fifth PH-aligned state to have fallen to PN via de­fec­tions if Mr Musa had suc­ceeded.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Shafie man­aged to ob­tain the gover­nor’s con­sent to dis­solve the assem­bly in­stead and hold fresh elec­tions.</p>
