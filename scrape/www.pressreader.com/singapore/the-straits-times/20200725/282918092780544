    <p>Se­lena Gomez cel­e­brated her birth­day with the launch of a cam­paign to make men­tal health ser­vices more ac­ces­si­ble to un­der-served com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can singer, who turned 28 on Wed­nes­day, is known to be a men­tal health ad­vo­cate and has spo­ken pub­licly about be­ing di­ag­nosed with bipo­lar dis­or­der.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, Rare Beauty, the cos­met­ics line she founded ear­lier this year, launched the Rare Im­pact Fund, which aims to raise US$100 mil­lion (S$138 mil­lion) in 10 years, to in­crease the ac­cess of un­der-served com­mu­ni­ties to men­tal health ser­vices.</p>
    <p>In an Instagram post, the com­pany said it would be work­ing to­wards the goal from its “very first sale” and that 1 per cent of its sales will go di­rectly to the fund.</p>
    <p>Mr Scott Fried­man, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Rare Beauty, said: “With the launch of the Rare Im­pact Fund, we will cre­ate one of the largest phil­an­thropic ef­forts fo­cused on men­tal health in the world.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany has also es­tab­lished the Rare Beauty Men­tal Health Coun­cil, which is made up of men­tal health ex­perts, who will help to steer the com­pany’s ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Gomez founded Rare Beauty in Fe­bru­ary this year and said ear­lier that its prod­ucts will be launched in North Amer­ica in sum­mer.</p>
    <p>The Lose You To Love Me singer does not shy away from dis­cus­sions on her men­tal health. In April this year, she spoke with singer Miley Cyrus on her bipo­lar dis­or­der in the lat­ter’s Bright Minded Instagram Live se­ries.</p>
    <p>On her re­cov­ery at McLean Hos­pi­tal in Mas­sachusetts, Gomez said: “Re­cently, I went to one of the best men­tal hos­pi­tals in... the United States, McClean Hos­pi­tal, and I dis­cussed that af­ter years of go­ing through a lot of dif­fer­ent things, I re­alised that I was bipo­lar. And so, when I got to know more in­for­ma­tion, it helped me. It doesn’t scare me once I know it.”</p>
    <p>Last year, the singer won the McClean Award given out by the hos­pi­tal to in­di­vid­u­als who have helped deepen the pub­lic’s un­der­stand­ing of psy­chi­atric ill­ness and men­tal health.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, Gomez said: “Since the brand’s in­cep­tion, we wanted to find a way to give back to our com­mu­nity and fur­ther sup­port peo­ple who needed ac­cess to men­tal health ser­vices, which have had a pro­found im­pact on my life.”</p>
