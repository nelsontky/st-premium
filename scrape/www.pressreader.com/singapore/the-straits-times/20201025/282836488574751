    <p>At the age of 57, Mr Os­man Bin As­pari still had a de­sire to pur­sue his pas­sions. Af­ter 31 years of work­ing a 24/7 sched­ule man­ag­ing staff and co­or­di­nat­ing re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion pro­grammes for prison in­mates, he felt he was ready for a change, and new op­por­tu­ni­ties. “I wanted to chal­lenge my­self and see how else I could ap­ply my tal­ents,” he re­called.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in to­day’s hyper-com­pet­i­tive job mar­ket, it takes more than am­bi­tion and tal­ent to se­cure the job you want. Po­ten­tial em­ploy­ees like Mr Os­man are ex­pected to con­vince prospec­tive em­ploy­ers that their skills can be ap­plied to a con­stantly-ad­vanc­ing workspace. But even this is not a guar­an­tee, as younger ap­pli­cants too are find­ing it dif­fi­cult to se­cure in­ter­views.</p>
    <p>At first, Mr Os­man en­joyed some ini­tial suc­cess. He landed a vol­un­teer­ing job pro­vid­ing care for at-risk youth, but quickly re­alised that it wasn’t what he wanted. So he re­sumed his search anew, this time shift­ing the fo­cus from what he wanted to what he could of fer.</p>
    <p>Find­ing the right match</p>
    <p>Un­der­stand­ing your strengths and how they align with your goals is only the first step. “Op­er­a­tions and man­ag­ing peo­ple are my for te and I re­alised that many teach­ing in­sti­tu­tions were look­ing for this skill set, so nat­u­rally that ’s where I ap­plied to,” said Mr Os­man.</p>
    <p>But the nar­rower the job scope, the tighter the com­pe­ti­tion. Even though he set his sights on roles that matched his skills, he re­ceived more re­jec tion than ever, stat­ing: “It seemed that ever y time I ap­plied, I al­ways got re­sponses telling me that I wasn’t suc­cess­ful.”</p>
    <p>He also strug­gled to mea­sure how much or how lit­tle he should dis­close on his CV, and when he re­ceived the rare chance to at­tend a job in­ter view, he re­alised he was not quite pre­pared, say­ing: “In­ter views were also tough. I also found it dif fi­cult to an­swer some ques­tions that I thought were in­tim­i­dat­ing.”</p>
    <p>Play­ing up his strengths</p>
    <p>His ca­reer coach from WSG’s Ca­reer Match­ing Provider, Ingeus, guided him in a job search and quickly no­ticed the tra­jec­tory chang­ing course.</p>
    <p>Through­out the process Mr Os­man’s ap­proach was as­sessed and a per­son­alised plan to out­line his goals and how he could achieve them was cre­ated. This first step of a scorecard system gave him new in­sights into his unique ca­pa­bil­i­ties, and how he could lever­age them to im­prove the chances of be­ing an ideal can­di­date.</p>
    <p>His ca­reer coach helped point out that his main as­set is a unique man­age­ment style de­vel­oped through 31 years of work­ing in the re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion in­dustr y. This was a crit­i­cal com­mu­ni­ca­tion skill that re­lied not only on giv­ing or­ders to a sin­gle group, but fa­cil­i­tat­ing de­mands and bal­anc­ing ex­pec­ta­tions of all at dif fer­ent lev­els within the or­gan­i­sa­tion. “I re­alised that my strength was com­mu­ni­ca­tion, not only with up­per and mid­dle man­age­ment, but with ven­dors and the in­mates them­selves. This was cul­ti­vated from con­stantly adapt­ing the way I talked with each group, to get things done,” said Mr Os­man.</p>
    <p>Putting your best self for­ward</p>
    <p>Mr Os­man and his ca­reer coach then tar­geted two other ar­eas he found that he needed the most help in: build­ing an im­pres­sive CV and im­prov­ing the way he per­formed dur­ing in­ter­views. Mr Os­man was im­pressed with his ca­reer coach’s hands-on ap­proach to work closely with and keep him in­formed of po­ten­tial op­por­tu­ni­ties along the job search.</p>
    <p>His ca­reer coach rec­om­mended spe­cific CV build­ing work­shops in the WSG Ca­reer Match­ing Ser­vices cat­a­logue. Th­ese sem­i­nars helped him high­light ad­di­tional ex­pe­ri­ences and skills he possessed to help im­prove his at­trac­tive­ness as an ap­pli­cant.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, he also learned a num­ber of tech­niques that im­proved his chances of call­back in­ter­views, say­ing: “My coach not only helped me to fine­tune my CV, but de­velop soft skills such as show­ing con­tin­ued in­ter­est by send­ing fol­low-up emails to prospec­tive em­ploy­ers.”</p>
    <p>Next, Mr Os­man and his coach worked on his in­ter­view­ing tech­niques, which he felt had been a sig­nif­i­cant hur­dle. “At my age, I tend to get very anx­ious dur­ing the in­ter­view process,” he said. “And some­times I felt that my an­swers back­fired and di­min­ished my chances," he added.</p>
    <p>But with the help of his coach, his ap­proach to in­ter­views shifted sig­nif­i­cantly.</p>
    <p>De­ter­mi­na­tion is key to suc­cess To­day, Mr Os­man is hap­pily em­ployed as the op­er­a­tions man­ager at a ju­nior col­lege. He still speaks to his Ingeus ca­reer coach about ad­di­tional pro­grammes that could help sup­port him in his cur­rent po­si­tion. Through the many set­backs of job seek­ing with lim­ited prospects, Mr Os­man cred­its his ca­reer coach as a part­ner that has helped guide, em­power and de­velop him to be the per­fect fit for his role to­day.</p>
