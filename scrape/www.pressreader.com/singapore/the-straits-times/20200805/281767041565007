    <p>NEW YORK • Blow-out par­ties and ris­ing cases na­tion­ally prompted New Jersey to lower crowd caps and New York to call for stricter dis­tanc­ing en­force­ment or risk a resur­gence of the coro­n­avirus in the pan­demic’s early US epi­cen­tre.</p>
    <p>New Jersey Gov­er­nor Phil Mur­phy cut the in­door-gath­er­ing limit by 75 per cent, to 25 peo­ple, af­ter a spate of house par­ties led to al­most 100 cases.</p>
    <p>The state’s virus trans­mis­sion rate, a key spread in­di­ca­tor, has jumped to the high­est since early April.</p>
    <p>In New York, Gov­er­nor An­drew Cuomo said week­end gath­er­ings ig­nor­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules – in­clud­ing a party boat with 170 guests aboard cruis­ing around Man­hat­tan and a rave that drew hun­dreds be­neath the Kosciuszko Bridge in Brook­lyn – will lead to the virus boomerang­ing around the coun­try.</p>
    <p>In­spec­tors is­sued 106 vi­o­la­tions to restau­rants and bars at the week­end for not fol­low­ing con­tain­ment or­ders.</p>
    <p>While the United States re­ported a rise in new cases of less than 1 per cent, be­low the 1.4 per cent av­er­age of the past week, states that suf­fered the most in March and April saw causes for alarm.</p>
    <p>They have joined Con­necti­cut in re­quir­ing vis­i­tors from al­most three dozen states deemed as trou­ble zones to self-quar­an­tine, and are tak­ing a cau­tious ap­proach as the start of school nears.</p>
    <p>Gov­er­nor Cuomo said on Mon­day: “It will con­tinue, this ric­o­chet­ing across the coun­try, be­cause that is what viruses do.”</p>
    <p>In Houston, Mayor Sylvester Turner told po­lice to start is­su­ing warn­ings and ci­ta­tions for any­one with­out a mask on.</p>
    <p>“There are too many street par­ties, house par­ties, zy­de­cos on the cor­ners, back­yard par­ties, and more hap­pen­ing in our city es­pe­cially when in­di­vid­u­als are not wear­ing masks,” Mayor Turner said in a post on Twit­ter on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Ge­or­gia, one of the first states to re­open, had been a suc­cess story as cases did not start ris­ing as peo­ple ven­tured out more. But on Sun­day, a state re­port showed 235 new in­fec­tions per 100,000 peo­ple last week, while the na­tional av­er­age is 137 per 100,000.</p>
    <p>“Ge­or­gia con­tin­ues to ex­pe­ri­ence a high plateau of case in­ci­dence and saw an in­crease in test­ing pos­i­tiv­ity over the past week,” ac­cord­ing to the re­port.</p>
    <p>Some states re­ported pos­i­tive in­di­ca­tors on Mon­day, though week­end de­lays can skew data. Ari­zona recorded 1,030 new cases, the low­est since late June, though its pos­i­tiv­ity rate – the per­cent­age of peo­ple tested who turn out to have the virus – re­mains crit­i­cally high at 12.9 per cent statewide.</p>
    <p>In Cal­i­for­nia, Gov­er­nor Gavin New­som sig­nalled that the state may be turn­ing a cor­ner af­ter a surge of in­fec­tions last month, with the seven-day av­er­age for new cases fall­ing 21 per cent from last week. The av­er­age pos­i­tiv­ity rate over seven days has slipped to 6.1 per cent from a peak of 8 per cent late last month.</p>
    <p>“It is en­cour­ag­ing,” Gov­er­nor New­som said at a brief­ing on Mon­day. “At the same time, we can quickly find our­selves back to where we were just a few weeks ago, a month ago, with sig­nif­i­cant in­creases, if we do not main­tain our vig­i­lance.”</p>
    <p>The US has had nearly 159,000 deaths, and cases reached 4.86 mil­lion yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>TOO MANY PAR­TIES</p>
    <p>There are too many street par­ties, house par­ties, zy­de­cos on the cor­ners, back­yard par­ties, and more hap­pen­ing in our city es­pe­cially when in­di­vid­u­als ’’ are not wear­ing masks. HOUSTON MAYOR SYLVESTER TURNER, who told po­lice to start is­su­ing warn­ings and ci­ta­tions for any­one with­out a mask on.</p>
