    <p>Step­ping off the bum­boat and on to Pu­lau Ubin can feel like a trip back in time, to when kam­pungs used to dot the main­land, sur­rounded by na­ture.</p>
    <p>But the isle to the Repub­lic’s north-east may be a glimpse into the fu­ture: As Sin­ga­pore as­pires to be­come a City in Na­ture, with more green in­fused into the grey cityscape, there are lessons that can be drawn from wildlife con­ser­va­tion ef­forts on rus­tic Ubin.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, pre­lim­i­nary find­ings from the first com­pre­hen­sive bio­di­ver­sity sur­vey there showed the tiny isle to be home to at least 20 new an­i­mal species. They in­clude a spi­der species new to sci­ence, six an­i­mals never be­fore seen in Sin­ga­pore, in­clud­ing the swamp tiger but­ter­fly, and 13 oth­ers that were firsts for Pu­lau Ubin, like the black-bearded tomb bat.</p>
    <p>The new records add to the in­ven­tory of wildlife on the is­land.</p>
    <p>But­ter­fly en­thu­si­ast Khew Sin Khoon says more than half of the species found on main­land Sin­ga­pore were recorded on Pu­lau Ubin.</p>
    <p>But how is it that this tiny is­land – more than 70 times smaller than the main­land – is so rich in bio­di­ver­sity? To find out, we spent many days and a night on the is­land over the past month, speak­ing with re­searchers, nat­u­ral­ists and con­ser­va­tion man­agers about the “in­gre­di­ents” that make Ubin hum with wildlife.</p>
    <p>A VER­I­TA­BLE BUF­FET</p>
    <p>Na­tional University of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) bi­ol­ogy lec­turer N. Si­va­sothi has the per­fect anal­ogy to ex­plain to food-lov­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans why</p>
    <p>Ubin is so rich in life.</p>
    <p>“It is like a hawker cen­tre where you can find many dif­fer­ent types of food,” he tells us. “That’s the mag­i­cal thing about Ubin: You can find mul­ti­ple habi­tats in one place. There are sea­grass, rocky shores, sandy beaches, mud­flats, man­groves, and a va­ri­ety of dif­fer­ent types of forests.”</p>
    <p>In the an­i­mal king­dom, va­ri­ety is the spice of life. The habi­tats con­tain dif­fer­ent com­mu­ni­ties of an­i­mals. Each species has dif­fer­ent pref­er­ences for where the an­i­mals live and what they eat, and the va­ri­ety en­sures they all can find some­thing for them­selves on the is­land.</p>
    <p>We quickly dis­cov­ered this for our­selves. Near the pub­lic jetty, the horn­bills’ squawks wel­comed us. But 3km away in the Chek Jawa Wet­lands, it was the melody of the straw-headed bul­bul (a bird crit­i­cally en­dan­gered world­wide, but one that has found a refuge in Sin­ga­pore) that was most dis­tinct.</p>
    <p>At low tide, au­ral stim­u­la­tion was re­placed with some­thing more tac­tile, when Mr Alan Tan, an ex­pe­ri­enced na­ture guide for Chek Jawa with the Na­tional Parks Board (NParks), took us on an in­ter­tidal walk. He pointed out the no­ble vo­lute – a sea snail that has a fancy shell but even fancier flesh – dif­fer­ent types of sea­grass and el­bow crabs, so called for their dis­tinct pin­cers which jut out to the sides like el­bows.</p>
    <p>When night fell, we ven­tured out into the sec­ondary for­est and man­grove ar­eas on the is­land with Mr Noel Thomas, NParks’ se­nior man­ager for con­ser­va­tion on Pu­lau Ubin, armed with head­lamps and red torches. The glow of the head­lamps il­lu­mi­nated our path ahead, which was lit­tered with thou­sands of tiny, shiny “di­a­monds”.</p>
    <p>We soon learnt that those pin­pricks were the “eye shine” of spi­ders. They were look­ing at us, and the “di­a­monds” were our head­lamps be­ing re­flected in their eyes.</p>
    <p>De­tect­ing eye shine is one strat­egy re­searchers use on noc­tur­nal mam­mal sur­veys, says Mr Thomas, who heads the com­pre­hen­sive Ubin bio­di­ver­sity sur­vey (Cubs).</p>
    <p>We soon spot­ted a mam­mal of the night in this way – the greater mousedeer, which is sur­pris­ingly small, the size of a do­mes­tic cat.</p>
    <p>When its eye shine was de­tected, head­lamps were turned off and red torches used in­stead, as these do not dis­turb the an­i­mals as much.</p>
    <p>Since Jan­uary 2018, over 200 NParks em­ploy­ees, NUS re­searchers and cit­i­zen sci­en­tists from na­ture groups such as the Na­ture So­ci­ety (Sin­ga­pore), Her­peto­log­i­cal So­ci­ety of Sin­ga­pore (her­petol­ogy is the branch of zo­ol­ogy con­cerned with the study of am­phib­ians) and But­ter­fly Cir­cle have taken part in over 165 field sur­veys that make up Cubs.</p>
    <p>Ubin is driven by con­ser­va­tion, says Mr Thomas.</p>
    <p>“In or­der to truly pro­tect what we have, we need to un­der­stand and know what we have,” he says.</p>
    <p>“So bio­di­ver­sity sur­veys like this give us the in­for­ma­tion that we need to move for­ward with the species re­cov­ery and habi­tat en­hance­ment projects that we do.”</p>
    <p>LEND­ING NA­TURE A HAND</p>
    <p>There is a hillock on Pu­lau Ubin where the swamp tiger but­ter­fly was found dur­ing Cubs, and it is aptly named But­ter­fly Hill.</p>
    <p>Today, the hillock is lush, and but­ter­flies flut­ter near our an­kles in search of the next nec­tar­ing plant.</p>
    <p>But Mr Khew, who runs the But­ter­fly Cir­cle (Sin­ga­pore) cit­i­zen sci­ence blog doc­u­ment­ing the in­sect, tells us that it did not al­ways look this way. “About 15 years ago, when we first started, it was a dump­ing ground for the quar­ry­ing ac­tiv­i­ties,” he says.</p>
    <p>But­ter­fly en­thu­si­asts like Mr Khew worked with NParks to re­ha­bil­i­tate the area, grow­ing plants needed by both but­ter­flies and their young – cater­pil­lars.</p>
    <p>Their ef­forts paid off, and this year they were re­warded with the sight of the swamp tiger but­ter­fly – the first record of the species not just on Ubin, but in Sin­ga­pore too.</p>
    <p>It may be easy to con­clude that Ubin is un­touched by devel­op­ment be­cause of its rus­tic vibe, with kam­pung houses and over­grown veg­e­ta­tion in many parts of the is­land. But that is not the case.</p>
    <p>The orig­i­nal name of the is­land is Pu­lau Batu Ju­bin, or gran­ite stone is­land in Malay. It hear­kens back to the 19th cen­tury, when gran­ite min­ing be­gan on the is­land.</p>
    <p>The quar­ries started clos­ing in the 1970s, but their legacy is still ap­par­ent. There are five main ar­eas with aban­doned gran­ite quar­ries gouged out of the ter­rain, and today they are still around, although they have been filled by rain­wa­ter.</p>
    <p>Ef­forts are un­der way to bring life back to these quar­ries.</p>
    <p>At Pekan Quarry, for ex­am­ple, NParks pi­loted a float­ing wet­land sys­tem in 2015. Now, more than 6,000 float­ing mod­ules have been de­ployed at Pekan Quarry to form three clus­ters of wet­land plat­forms, and a fourth clus­ter with 10 nest­ing struc­tures for herons.</p>
    <p>Mr David Tan, a doc­toral stu­dent in or­nithol­ogy at the University of</p>
    <p>New Mex­ico, said the wet­lands could bring wildlife closer to the pub­lic, and pro­vide habi­tats for birds that pre­fer grassy, reedy habi­tats, such as king­fish­ers.</p>
    <p>“Some mi­grat­ing wet­land birds like grasshop­per war­blers and reed war­blers could use these ar­eas as habi­tats while stop­ping over on mi­gra­tion as well,” he says.</p>
    <p>Mr Robert Teo, NParks’ direc­tor for con­ser­va­tion on Pu­lau Ubin who has worked on the is­land for over 20 years, says Ubin does not have a vir­gin land­scape – much of its orig­i­nal for­est had al­ready been cleared by past ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“What we see here today is a re­sult of al­low­ing na­ture to take its course in re­gen­er­a­tion, as well as NParks’ ef­forts at habi­tat en­hance­ment and species re­cov­ery projects,” he says.</p>
    <p>“With­out such in­ter­ven­tion, we will not see the high amount of plant bio­di­ver­sity, be­cause the orig­i­nal is­land will not have some of these species to start with.”</p>
    <p>But there is more to help­ing wildlife re­turn than just plant­ing trees and hop­ing the an­i­mals use them. At one site be­ing used for a</p>
    <p>“It is like a hawker cen­tre where you can find many dif­fer­ent types of food... That’s the mag­i­cal thing about Ubin: You can find mul­ti­ple habi­tats in one place. There are sea­grass, rocky shores, sandy beaches, mud­flats, man­groves, and a va­ri­ety of dif­fer­ent types of forests.”</p>
    <p>NA­TIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SIN­GA­PORE BI­OL­OGY LEC­TURER N. SI­VA­SOTHI, on Pu­lau Ubin’s di­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>species re­cov­ery pro­gramme for three un­com­mon birds, in­clud­ing the blue-throated bee-eater, the land­scape ap­peared rather bar­ren. In­stead of trees, there were mounds of earth. In­stead of grass, gravel crunched un­der our feet.</p>
    <p>The blue-throated bee-eater needs bare ar­eas or short grass to bur­row and build a tun­nel nest, Mr Teo explains. “We are try­ing out dif­fer­ent shapes of mounds – some are flat­ter, oth­ers are taller – as well as dif­fer­ent sub­strates. Some have more sand and gravel, oth­ers have more earth. We will mon­i­tor which is the best com­bi­na­tion of sub­strate and shape for the birds.”</p>
    <p>Nest­ing ar­eas of the bluethroat­ed bee-eater are un­com­mon on the main­land, says Mr Teo.</p>
    <p>“So this species re­cov­ery project com­ple­ments pop­u­la­tions on the main­land. Hope­fully, with these sup­ple­men­tary nest­ing sites, their pop­u­la­tions will in­crease and they may even re­turn to the main­land to es­tab­lish new pop­u­la­tion.”</p>
    <p>THE LAND IN BE­TWEEN</p>
    <p>Pu­lau Ubin’s l oca­tion be­tween main­land Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia means it can wel­come wildlife mov­ing from ei­ther side of the Cause­way. NUS’ Mr Si­va­sothi says Ubin serves as a “sink” for an­i­mals from south­ern Jo­hor, mean­ing an­i­mals from there may come to the is­land.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, the is­land could also be a source for wildlife in Sin­ga­pore, he says, not­ing how the once-lo­cally ex­tinct horn­bills had dis­persed to the main­land from Ubin.</p>
    <p>Mr Si­va­sothi also notes that when Sin­ga­pore was un­der­go­ing devel­op­ment in its early years, its habi­tats had suf­fered.</p>
    <p>But as the pace of devel­op­ment slowed in Sin­ga­pore and con­ser­va­tion ef­forts took hold, Malaysia was still a “source” for wildlife, and an­i­mals from there could still find their way to Ubin and then to main­land Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He adds: “Right now there’s a lot of devel­op­ment in the south­ern coast of Jo­hor. Maybe one day we can re­turn the favour.”</p>
