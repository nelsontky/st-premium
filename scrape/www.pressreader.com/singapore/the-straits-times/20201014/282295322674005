    <p>LON­DON • The mother of a young Liver­pool fan who wrote to Jur­gen Klopp re­gard­ing his wor­ries about mov­ing schools said on Mon­day that they had been “blown away” by the Reds boss’ thought­ful re­ply.</p>
    <p>Lewis Balfe, 11, wrote to Klopp in Au­gust about the anx­i­ety he was feel­ing over start­ing at a new school last month.</p>
    <p>“He’s re­ally ex­cited and I was com­pletely blown away, be­cause I thought you might get a stan­dard re­sponse from the club or you might get some ac­knowl­edge­ment, but I didn’t think you’d get a let­ter so per­sonal,” Milena Balfe told Bri­tain’s Press As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>In his let­ter, Klopp, who guided Liver­pool to their first English ti­tle of the Premier League era last sea­son, wrote: “Can I start by telling you a se­cret? I get ner­vous.</p>
    <p>“To be to­tally hon­est, I would be wor­ried if I did not get ner­vous be­cause when it hap­pens it gives me the chance to turn that en­ergy into some­thing pos­i­tive.”</p>
    <p>The Ger­man added: “I know it might be strange for a boy of your age to think that the Liver­pool man­ager can feel the way that you do but I do. From your let­ter it is clear that you are very thought­ful and also very car­ing and when you have these qual­i­ties it is very hard to avoid get­ting ner­vous.</p>
    <p>“You asked me what I do when my play­ers feel this way and the an­swer is sim­ple – I re­mind them of how im­por­tant they are to me and how much I be­lieve in them and I have no doubt that it will be ex­actly the same for your fam­ily with you. You do not need to worry about bad things hap­pen­ing. As you know, I lost more than a few fi­nals and this isn’t a good feel­ing but with the help of my fam­ily and friends I kept go­ing and in the end we were able to en­joy some re­ally good times.</p>
    <p>“If I had dwelled on the bad mo­ments I know that this would not have been pos­si­ble so please be pos­i­tive about your­self and look for­ward to the bril­liant time that I know you will have grow­ing up.”</p>
