    <p>March 21 - April 19 Your body is still rul­ing your life – though that should be a good thing. Fol­low up on your less spir­i­tual feel­ings and see where they lead. You are sure to be sur­prised and de­lighted. April 20 - May 20 Try not to show off too much. You need to check that you are in the right be­fore you make any as­sump­tions. At least one per­son knows bet­ter than you, so find him or her and learn. May 21 - June 20 Your opin­ions are hard to keep to your­self, so do not bother try­ing. Peo­ple can read your face more eas­ily and you should find that you have more sway than usual. Keep on talk­ing. June 21 - July 22 Your will­ing­ness to show off a lit­tle is making your friends even hap­pier to spend time with you – they like the light you give off. Keep it up and see where the night takes you. July 23 - Aug 22 Your abil­ity to at­tract at­ten­tion is height­ened right now – in fact, some may mis­take you for a celebrity. It is a re­ally good time to get your­self back on track and maybe ac­quire a new love in­ter­est. Aug 23 - Sept 22 You are not as con­fi­dent as usual, but ev­ery­one loves an un­der­dog. See if you can get your friends and fam­ily to pitch in and help you push through this dif­fi­cult time. It will not last long. Sept 23 - Oct 22 Your so­cial ties are keep­ing you happy and en­gaged, so make sure they are all pos­i­tive. Your en­ergy is ter­rific, if a bit un­fo­cused, so hang out with friends and see what comes next. Oct 23 - Nov 21 You are hav­ing work prob­lems, or more specif­i­cally, boss prob­lems. That could mean you can­not find some­one to hire you, though that sit­u­a­tion should be pretty short-lived. Nov 22 - Dec 21 Get out of town. Travel is on your mind right now and you should find that it is in­cred­i­bly re­ward­ing to go over­seas or find some­where new. Be as spon­ta­neous as you can. Dec 22 - Jan 19 A col­league or cus­tomer makes your life con­sid­er­ably harder, but you can­not share the bur­den. That does not mean you are help­less, though. You just have to be firmer next time. Jan 20 - Feb 18 You feel torn be­tween act­ing on im­pulse and fol­low­ing the plan – what­ever it may be. It is al­most cer­tainly best to go with your gut and veer off course, though try to do so re­spect­fully. Feb 19 - March 20 Your boss is in a bad mood and you are not sure you un­der­stand why. If your job sit­u­a­tion is such that you do not re­ally have a boss, you may have to worry about a dif­fer­ent kind of au­thor­ity fig­ure.</p>
