    <p>NEW YORK • Fig­ur­ing out where and how to start the ten­nis sea­son is usu­ally pretty easy for the world’s top play­ers.</p>
    <p>They catch a flight to Aus­tralia around Christ­mas, spend a few days get­ting over the jet lag, then com­pete for two weeks in warmup tour­na­ments ahead of the Aus­tralian Open.</p>
    <p>But with the sport’s cal­en­dar up­ended by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, which prompted a three­week de­lay of the Aus­tralian Open, play­ers have had to make dif­fi­cult cal­cu­la­tions about the value of trav­el­ling to com­pete now, as in­fec­tion rates are still soar­ing in many parts of the world.</p>
    <p>As the 2021 sea­son be­gan last week, sev­eral top play­ers opted not to at­tend the only open­ing tour­na­ments be­fore they have to quar­an­tine for two weeks in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>This year, they can­not sim­ply show up in Aus­tralia and com­pete right away. World No. 1 No­vak Djokovic and sec­ond-ranked Rafael Nadal re­mained on their prac­tice courts rather than ven­tur­ing to Turkey or Florida for the first events on their ATP Tour.</p>
    <p>Andy Mur­ray, a three-time Grand Slam win­ner, was sup­posed to play in Florida, then grew skit­tish about trav­el­ling dur­ing the pan­demic and pulled out.</p>
    <p>On the women’s side, Ser­ena Wil­liams and Naomi Osaka skipped the on­go­ing event in Abu Dhabi.</p>
    <p>The plans for those three tour­na­ments were an­nounced only late last month, as the or­gan­is­ers of the Aus­tralian Open de­cided that the start of their Grand Slam event would be de­layed un­til Feb 8 and that all par­tic­i­pants would be re­quired to heav­ily re­strict their</p>
    <p>move­ments for two weeks ahead of the hard-court Ma­jor.</p>
    <p>“For a lot of play­ers, since it was sprung on them a bit last minute, they were not ready and didn’t want to com­pete,” said Bri­tain’s Cameron Nor­rie, who opted to play in Florida at the Del­ray Beach Open.</p>
    <p>The sched­ule fol­lows an off-sea­son that, for most play­ers, was longer than the usual six-week break. The pan­demic forced the WTA Tour to can­cel its fall Asia swing.</p>
    <p>On the men’s side, for all but the top play­ers, there has not been a tour­na­ment since early Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>For most top play­ers, the de­ci­sion to play or not to play in the</p>
    <p>warm-up events ul­ti­mately came down to whether they thought play­ing real matches now would help them get men­tally and phys­i­cally pre­pared for the Slam.</p>
    <p>“I need some time to get back into rhythm and play more matches,” said Be­laru­sian Aryna Sa­balenka, who reached the last eight in Abu Dhabi after beat­ing Tu­nisian Ons Jabeur 6-2, 6-4 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The open ques­tion for her and other play­ers is how their in­di­vid­ual choices dur­ing the first weeks of the sea­son might play into the un­usual rou­tines for this Aus­tralian Open.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the quar­an­tine, play­ers will be al­lowed to prac­tise for only</p>
    <p>two hours each day, ini­tially with just one prac­tice part­ner and then with two more in the sec­ond week.</p>
    <p>They will also get to spend about two hours in the gym, and one other hour at the ten­nis cen­tre in Mel­bourne, but must spend the 19 other hours in their ho­tel rooms.</p>
    <p>After the quar­an­tine, the men’s and women’s tours will hold three com­pet­i­tive events in Mel­bourne in the week be­fore the Open.</p>
    <p>Craig Mor­ris, a for­mer coach for Aus­tralian Sa­man­tha Sto­sur, said that given how lit­tle ten­nis took place last year, ex­tra com­pe­ti­tion this month could be valu­able.</p>
    <p>“Any­thing they can get un­der the belt is go­ing to help,” he said.</p>
    <p>For a lot of play­ers, since it was sprung on them a bit last minute, they were not ready and didn’t want to com­pete.</p>
