    <p>LON­DON • The claim that Bri­tain is a coun­try in de­cline and that it has will­ingly writ­ten it­self off the top league of na­tions is by now so wide­spread as to be ac­cepted wis­dom.</p>
    <p>On an al­most daily ba­sis, one gets some me­dia com­men­ta­tor some­where be­moan­ing the sup­posed fate of the na­tion which used to run the big­gest em­pire the world has ever known, but has now been re­duced to the sta­tus of a windswept group of is­lands on the edge of Europe, ob­sessed with its own in­ter­nal squab­bles, un­able and un­will­ing to deal with trends in the wider world.</p>
    <p>Un­doubt­edly, there is some truth in this view. For no par­tic­u­lar rea­son and largely due to do­mes­tic party pol­i­tics, the Bri­tish have wasted the past four years in in­ter­minable dis­putes about how and why they should leave the Euro­pean Union, a use­less ar­gu­ment which very of­ten felt like a ram­bling di­a­logue be­tween a psy­chi­a­trist and a pa­tient, rather than a se­ri­ous de­bate about a na­tion’s fu­ture.</p>
    <p>And, even if a deal is con­cluded be­tween the EU and Bri­tain this week – the very last op­por­tu­nity to pre­serve the free trade frame­work with the con­ti­nent – ev­ery­one agrees that the Bri­tish econ­omy won’t ben­e­fit from Brexit.</p>
    <p>In short, if you ever needed to see how a na­tion can shoot it­self in the foot, you can­not do bet­ter than to look at to­day’s Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>And yet, that’s only part of the story, and very much a part which be­longs to the past. For de­spite be­ing in the throes of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and de­spite fac­ing huge de­mands on its al­ready stretched fi­nances, Bri­tain has an­nounced the big­gest hike in its mil­i­tary bud­get since the end of the Cold War. That is not the ac­tion of a coun­try about to aban­don its in­ter­na­tional re­spon­si­bil­i­ties. Nor is it an in­di­ca­tion of a na­tion which sees it­self as be­ing locked into an ir­re­versible de­cline.</p>
    <p>The big­gest mis­take out­side com­men­ta­tors and diplo­mats make about Bri­tain is to view the coun­try’s de­ci­sion to leave the EU as some sort of a na­tion­al­ist out­burst from people who are dream­ing of restor­ing the coun­try’s old colo­nial glo­ries. This is just non­sense ped­dled either by those who know lit­tle about the coun­try, or those de­ter­mined to view Bri­tain through the spec­trum of pre­vi­ous gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>LESSONS FROM FOR­MER COLONIES</p>
    <p>For the re­al­ity is that, apart from a few iso­lated nut­cases, none of the Bri­tish politi­cians who sup­ported Brexit talked about restor­ing the old em­pire. In­deed, if the spirit of the past played any role in the EU de­bate, it was in re­verse: as proof of how for­mer Bri­tish colonies did very well on their own in the big wide world.</p>
    <p>The ex­am­ple of Aus­tralia was of­ten brought up dur­ing the 2016 ref­er­en­dum – which re­sulted in Bri­tain’s de­par­ture from the EU – to sug­gest that coun­tries can thrive eco­nom­i­cally with­out be­ing part of a tight re­gional po­lit­i­cal struc­ture.</p>
    <p>Canada was of­fered as proof that one can live next to a mighty neigh­bour such as the United States, grow ut­terly de­pen­dent on trade with this neigh­bour, yet still main­tain one’s in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>And Sin­ga­pore was of­ten pre­sented as an ex­am­ple that the size of a coun­try mat­ters less than the qual­ity of its gov­er­nance and its in­ge­nu­ity.</p>
    <p>Many of these ar­gu­ments were off the mark, and many of the com­par­isons sim­ply in­ap­pli­ca­ble. None­the­less, if there was any im­pe­rial nostal­gia in Bri­tain’s de­ci­sion to leave the EU, it was of the “em­pire strikes back” va­ri­ety, of the idea that it is now up to the Bri­tish to learn from their for­mer colonies.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, ev­ery sin­gle one of the Bri­tish politi­cians who ad­vo­cated leav­ing the EU did so on the ar­gu­ment that this will be a first step to­wards more rather than less in­te­gra­tion into the global econ­omy. Mis­con­ceived? Per­haps. A re­turn to “fortress Bri­tain”?</p>
    <p>Most cer­tainly not.</p>
    <p>An­other mis­con­cep­tion of what is hap­pen­ing in Bri­tain is the com­par­i­son with the US, the al­le­ga­tion that the vic­tory of the Brexit sup­port­ers is akin to the rise of pop­ulism in the US, and that Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son is a “minia­ture Trump”. The lat­ter line is a par­tic­u­lar favourite of The New York Times, which now sees the world as es­sen­tially a moral­ity play on Amer­i­can do­mes­tic pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>But this re­mains a fun­da­men­tally wrong per­cep­tion. For al­though Mr John­son’s crit­ics would point to some sim­i­lar­i­ties be­tween the Bri­tish leader and Mr Don­ald Trump – in­clud­ing a rather dif­fi­cult re­la­tion­ship with women and an awk­ward ap­proach to facts, af­flic­tions from which both ap­pear to suf­fer – the</p>
    <p>John­son gov­ern­ment’s ap­proach to the world could not be more dif­fer­ent from that of the Trump White House.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish do not be­lieve in uni­lat­er­al­ism. They do be­lieve in the im­por­tance of in­ter­na­tional in­sti­tu­tions. They know they can­not thrive out­side po­lit­i­cal and mil­i­tary al­liances. And al­though, like many other na­tions, they have a se­lec­tive view of in­ter­na­tional obli­ga­tions they wish to re­spect and those they pre­fer to for­get, they ac­cept the ba­sic premise that they must fol­low words with ac­tion.</p>
    <p>It may have es­caped ev­ery­one’s at­ten­tion that Bri­tain is among the world’s top in­ter­na­tional aid donors. With the no­table ex­cep­tion of the Scan­di­na­vian na­tions and the Nether­lands, no coun­try in Europe de­votes more to in­ter­na­tional aid than Bri­tain; on a per capita ba­sis, the Bri­tish for­eign aid bud­get is about a third higher than that of Ger­many, more than dou­ble the French con­tri­bu­tion and a whop­ping 10 times the av­er­age for the Euro­pean Union as a whole.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, all of this aid is as de­fined by in­ter­na­tional stan­dards for the al­le­vi­a­tion of poverty, and not tied to the pur­chase of Bri­tish goods, nor one aimed at coun­tries po­lit­i­cally close to Bri­tain and most cer­tainly not one in­tended to cre­ate “belts and roads” of the Chi­nese va­ri­ety.</p>
    <p>It is pos­si­ble that dur­ing this week, as the Trea­sury in Lon­don an­nounces spend­ing re­views for the com­ing few years, the sum al­lo­cated to for­eign aid will be cut back. Still, if cur­rent pat­terns of high spend­ing on for­eign aid are an ex­am­ple of a Bri­tain in de­cline, then we should all pray for more na­tions to join in this cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>CLI­MATE AND DE­FENCE COM­MIT­MENTS</p>
    <p>Last month, the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment also un­veiled a hugely am­bi­tious pro­gramme of en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion mea­sures; Prime Min­is­ter John­son made not one but three “green” speeches to the UN bio­di­ver­sity sum­mit in New York. He also pledged to phase out petrol cars com­pletely by the end of this decade, as well as a whole ar­ray of other de­car­bon­i­sa­tion mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The EU is still strug­gling to agree on a for­mal target of a 55 per cent cut in over­all car­bon emis­sions by 2030; the Bri­tish have just pledged them­selves to a 65 per cent cut in their own emis­sions within the same time­frame and are de­ter­mined to push through these when they host the COP26 global en­vi­ron­men­tal sum­mit next year.</p>
    <p>Of course, big ques­tions re­main whether the Bri­tish pledges are re­al­is­tic or am­bi­tious enough. None­the­less, the de­ter­mi­na­tion to lead by ex­am­ple is there. Those who have claimed that Bri­tain was leav­ing the EU to es­cape from oner­ous in­ter­na­tional obli­ga­tions have sim­ply been proven wrong.</p>
    <p>But prob­a­bly the most spec­tac­u­lar de­vel­op­ment has been the re­cent Bri­tish gov­ern­ment de­ci­sion to al­lo­cate a mas­sive £16.1 bil­lion (S$28.9 bil­lion) of ex­tra cash to mil­i­tary spend­ing, the big­gest such boost since the end of the Cold War in the 1980s.</p>
    <p>It should be re­called that this is on top of the pledge to boost de­fence spend­ing by half a per­cent­age point above the rate of in­fla­tion, year in, year out, un­til the mid­dle of this decade. So, when all these pledges are added up, the re­sult is that by 2025, Bri­tain would have spent about £190 bil­lion on de­fence, mak­ing it the third-largest de­fence spender in the world, af­ter the US and China, if one sets aside the un­rep­re­sen­ta­tive ex­am­ple of Saudi Ara­bia.</p>
    <p>Yet again, one may try to dis­miss this as old dreams of em­pire, al­though the very same people who make such ar­gu­ments are also those who would have dis­missed Bri­tain as yes­ter­day’s story if it did not in­crease its de­fence spend­ing.</p>
    <p>But the truth re­mains that, along­side France, Bri­tain is and will con­tinue to be the only Euro­pean coun­try with a global mil­i­tary de­ploy­ment ca­pa­bil­ity. The windswept island on the edge of Europe will con­tinue to pack a con­sid­er­able mil­i­tary punch, and cer­tainly a big­ger one than all the EU mem­ber states which now talk about their de­ter­mi­na­tion to play a big­ger role on the global stage.</p>
    <p>Clearly, the Bri­tish are mak­ing this in­vest­ment be­cause they know that oth­er­wise, they will not be taken se­ri­ously by the in­com­ing Joe Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion in Washington. And, yes, there is also an el­e­ment of pride in try­ing to re­fute ac­cu­sa­tions of ir­rel­e­vance. But pride and a sense of self-im­por­tance are the driv­ers of most na­tions, and they should be wel­comed, rather than laughed at.</p>
    <p>None of this is to sug­gest that Bri­tain’s in­ter­minable de­bate about leav­ing the EU amounts to time well-spent. It can also be ar­gued that all these Bri­tish ini­tia­tives – on aid, en­vi­ron­ment, and de­fence – could have been ac­com­plished with­out the di­ver­sion of Brexit.</p>
    <p>Be that as it may, what can­not be ar­gued with any ac­cu­racy is that the Bri­tish are now out of the pic­ture, and an ir­rel­e­vance on the global stage.</p>
    <p>“Global Bri­tain”, as Prime Min­is­ter John­son likes to call his coun­try, is still a project un­der con­struc­tion. But the em­pha­sis on the word “global” is not in doubt.</p>
