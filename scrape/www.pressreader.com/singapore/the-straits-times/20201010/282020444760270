    <p>The sole woman linked to l ast year’s Or­chard Tow­ers mur­der was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to five months’ jail. Natalie Siow Yu Zhen was the third per­son linked to the case to be dealt with in court.</p>
    <p>The 24-year-old Sin­ga­porean pleaded guilty to as­sault and be­ing in the com­pany of one Tan Sen Yang, 28, who had a ker­am­bit knife in his pos­ses­sion at the shop­ping mall that day. The weapon is a curved blade re­sem­bling a claw.</p>
    <p>Two men linked to the in­ci­dent – of­fice ad­min­is­tra­tor Joel Tan Yun Sheng and ho­tel re­cep­tion­ist Ang Da Yuan, both 26 – were dealt with in court in March.</p>
    <p>These four, along with three other men – Tan Hong Sheng, Loo Boon Chong and Chan Jia Xing – were charged with 31-year-old Satheesh Noel Go­bidass’ mur­der last year. Joel Tan, Ang and Siow had their mur­der charges later re­duced to that of as­sault.</p>
    <p>Tan Hong Sheng, 23, Loo, 26, and Chan, 27, had their charges re­duced to that of con­sort­ing with a per­son car­ry­ing an of­fen­sive weapon in a pub­lic place.</p>
    <p>Tan Sen Yang is the only one still fac­ing a mur­der charge. The cases in­volv­ing him, Loo, Chan and Tan Hong Sheng are still pend­ing.</p>
    <p>Siow and her group had gone to the Naughty Girl Club on the sec­ond floor of Or­chard Tow­ers in the wee hours of July 2 last year.</p>
    <p>Their group was about to leave the club – at around 6.20am – when they ran into an­other group walk­ing in.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tors Ang Feng Qian, Dora Tay and Bene­dict Teong stated in court doc­u­ments that a dis­pute then broke out be­tween these two groups.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Tan Sen Yang then took out his ker­am­bit knife and swung it around, in­jur­ing two men.</p>
    <p>Af­ter some scuf­fling, some­one shouted “po­lice” and Siow’s group took a lift to the ground floor.</p>
    <p>Mr Satheesh also took an es­ca­la­tor down and con­fronted Ang. A scuf­fle broke out be­tween the two men. The court heard that Joel Tan, Tan Sen Yang and Siow joined in the scuf­fle.</p>
    <p>The prose­cu­tors said that Tan Sen Yang used the knife to slash Mr Satheesh, who later col­lapsed face first onto the floor.</p>
    <p>He was pro­nounced dead at Tan</p>
    <p>Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal at around 7.30am.</p>
    <p>De­fence l awyer Amar­ick Gill, who rep­re­sented Siow, told the court yes­ter­day that his client had learnt her les­son.</p>
    <p>Mr Gill added that Siow had ear­lier faced a cap­i­tal charge and the ex­pe­ri­ence had been “ex­tremely har­row­ing” for her. The court also heard that Siow was very sorry about Mr Satheesh’s death.</p>
