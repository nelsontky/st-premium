    <p>Lawyer Lim Tean was ar­rested in his of­fice yes­ter­day morn­ing, the po­lice said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim, who is the leader of the Peo­ples Voice po­lit­i­cal party, was ar­rested for sus­pected crim­i­nal breach of trust un­der the Pe­nal Code.</p>
    <p>He is also be­ing in­ves­ti­gated for an al­leged of­fence of un­law­ful stalk­ing un­der the Pro­tec­tion from Ha­rass­ment Act.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim’s lawyer, Mr M. Ravi, who posted about the ar­rest on Face­book yes­ter­day, said his client had protested that the ar­rest was po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated.</p>
    <p>Re­ject­ing those al­le­ga­tions, the po­lice said: “Mr Lim Tean’s al­leged vic­tims had filed po­lice re­ports al­leg­ing se­ri­ous of­fences by him against them, and the po­lice have a duty to in­ves­ti­gate the al­le­ga­tions.”</p>
    <p>Lawyers act­ing for Mr Lim’s for­mer client had lodged a po­lice re­port for crim­i­nal breach of trust, the po­lice said.</p>
    <p>The client, whom Mr Lim had rep­re­sented in a mo­tor in­jury suit, al­leged that the lawyer mis­ap­pro­pri­ated a sum of money awarded to him as dam­ages by the court.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim is also un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion for an un­law­ful stalk­ing com­plaint by a for­mer em­ployee.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said the em­ployee al­leged that she was ha­rassed by him when she was work­ing at his law firm, and re­ferred the po­lice to text mes­sages that had been ex­changed be­tween her and Mr Lim.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said they con­tacted and is­sued Mr Lim with a writ­ten no­tice on Sept 23, in­struct­ing him to at­tend a com­pul­sory in­ter­view at the Po­lice Can­ton­ment Com­plex on Mon­day to as­sist with in­ves­ti­ga­tions into the two of­fences.</p>
    <p>He was also told that he could resched­ule the in­ter­view to an­other date if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Lim replied through his lawyer on Sun­day, the day be­fore the in­ter­view, say­ing he had no in­ten­tion to turn up for the ses­sion and al­leg­ing that the in­ves­ti­ga­tions were po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated, the po­lice said.</p>
    <p>“As Mr Lim Tean did not co­op­er­ate with the no­tice to at­tend an in­ter­view with the po­lice, and had stated clearly that he had no in­tent to com­ply, the po­lice had no choice but to ar­rest Mr Lim Tean in or­der to con­duct the in­ves­ti­ga­tions,” the po­lice said.</p>
    <p>The ar­rest would not have been nec­es­sary if Mr Lim had com­plied</p>
    <p>with the po­lice no­tice to come for an in­ter­view, they added.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to queries, the po­lice shared a copy of the let­ter sent by Mr Lim’s lawyer on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>In the let­ter, Mr Lim said he was busy prepar­ing for “a very im­por­tant trial in­volv­ing the Prime Min­is­ter” in the High Court the fol­low­ing week, and will not be turn­ing up for the Mon­day in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>“Our client in­structs also that he has no in­ten­tion of turn­ing up for any in­ter­view as we are ver­ily in­structed that you are in­ves­ti­gat­ing trumped up charges against him which are po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated,” the let­ter said.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim is rep­re­sent­ing fi­nan­cial ad­viser Leong Sze Hian, who was sued for defama­tion by Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
    <p>The hear­ing is set to take place from next Tues­day to next Fri­day.</p>
    <p>In his Face­book post, Mr Ravi said that Mr Lim had in­structed him to act as his de­fence lawyer, adding that the ar­rest was “un­law­ful” as the case in which Mr Lim is ac­cused of crim­i­nal breach of trust is be­fore the civil court.</p>
    <p>Three po­lice of­fi­cers from the Com­mer­cial Af­fairs De­part­ment had barged into Mr Lim’s of­fice to ar­rest him while he was prepar­ing for the suit with Mr Leong, the de­fence lawyer wrote.</p>
    <p>Mr Ravi also posted photos show­ing Mr Lim, clad in red, be­ing hand­cuffed.</p>
    <p>He later up­dated that Mr Lim had has been bailed out by Mr Leong.</p>
