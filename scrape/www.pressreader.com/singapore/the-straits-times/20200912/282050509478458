    <p>This week, Ford hit a mile­stone in the Covid-19 saga.</p>
    <p>Back in March, the US car­maker had con­verted part of its (then-idled) as­sem­bly line to make med­i­cal equip­ment. The move came amid pres­sure from US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, in­clud­ing a tweet say­ing “GET GO­ING ON VEN­TI­LA­TORS, FAST!!!!!!”</p>
    <p>But now, af­ter de­liv­er­ing 50,000 ven­ti­la­tors in part­ner­ship with groups in­clud­ing 3M, Ford is halt­ing pro­duc­tion. It will fo­cus in­stead on churn­ing out</p>
    <p>100 mil­lion masks to blan­ket the United States as au­tumn – and the flu sea­son – ap­proach.</p>
    <p>The news high­lights a shift in the med­i­cal sci­ence, as Ford’s out­go­ing chief ex­ec­u­tive Jim Hack­ett said this week: “Most of the peo­ple who (have been) dy­ing were dy­ing from blood clots, so giv­ing peo­ple blood thin­ner and steroids has re­duced the need for ven­ti­la­tors. Masks are the pri­or­ity now.”</p>
    <p>Doc­tors are be­com­ing much savvier about con­tain­ing and treat­ing the coronaviru­s – and in­dus­trial pro­duc­tion is piv­ot­ing in re­sponse. And while this ther­a­peu­tic progress is not at­tract­ing as much at­ten­tion in fi­nan­cial mar­kets as the hunt for a vac­cine, it should be.</p>
    <p>The Ford saga also points to a big­ger loom­ing de­bate about sup­ply chains. Mr Hack­ett said that it was tough for Ford and other big in­dus­trial com­pa­nies to pivot into mak­ing med­i­cal equip­ment. Quite apart from the (ob­vi­ous) chal­lenge of ster­il­is­ing pre­vi­ously filthy as­sem­bly lines, it was al­most im­pos­si­ble to find ba­sic man­u­fac­tur­ing ma­te­ri­als when cross-bor­der sup­ply chains col­lapsed dur­ing lock­down.</p>
    <p>In­deed, Amer­i­can sup­plies of med­i­cal elas­tic ran so short that Ford en­gi­neers were forced to use car door sealants in­stead.</p>
    <p>This shock leaves Mr Hack­ett warn­ing that “those sup­ply chains (for med­i­cal equip­ment) will be re­designed be­cause of this”. More­over, the “re­design” will prob­a­bly not stop with med­i­cal gad­gets, given the ris­ing tides of pro­tec­tion­ism.</p>
    <p>“The Covid-19 cri­sis could be­come a pos­i­tive tip­ping point” in the lo­cal­i­sa­tion of in­dus­trial pro­duc­tion, ar­gue en­gi­neer­ing pro­fes­sors Srid­har Kota and</p>
    <p>Glenn Daehn. They think that the events have re­vealed sup­ply-chain vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties in nu­mer­ous sec­tors. More­over, Ford’s pandemic pivot has in­ad­ver­tently re­vealed another point: how creative the in­dus­trial groups can some­times be in re­or­gan­is­ing sup­ply chains in a cri­sis (par­tic­u­larly af­ter a presidenti­al tweet). Politi­cians will not for­get this.</p>
    <p>These events also re­veal a sub­tle but strik­ing shift in labour re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>His­tor­i­cally, there have been ter­ri­ble ten­sions be­tween unions and bosses in the auto sec­tor. How­ever, when Ford set about con­vert­ing as­sem­bly lines for the Covid-19 fight, Mr Hack­ett asked the United Auto Work­ers (UAW) union to find 1,000 vol­un­teers (out of 50,000 work­ers) and was flooded with of­fers, even with­out of­fer­ing ad­di­tional “dan­ger” pay.</p>
    <p>In the af­ter­math, Mr Hack­ett praised his “brother” Rory Gam­ble, head of the UAW – and Mr Gam­ble is equally ef­fu­sive. “This was a case of un­ex­pected event man­age­ment and Rory took con­trol in a way that was so re­fresh­ing and im­pres­sive,” says the Ford boss.</p>
    <p>Mr Gam­ble re­sponds: “We had one com­mon en­emy and united goal and this throws the old stereo­types about us fight­ing all the time out the win­dow. I hope it will last in the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>Such hopes might be over-op­ti­mistic: The new de­tente could be tested if an eco­nomic fall leads to job cuts. Ford, which ex­pects to lose money this year, this week an­nounced an early re­tire­ment pro­gramme as part of a pre-ex­ist­ing US$11 bil­lion</p>
    <p>(S$15 bil­lion) re­struc­tur­ing plan.</p>
    <p>How­ever, this broth­erly rhetoric also sug­gests that US bosses are re­spond­ing to a shift in the Amer­i­can zeit­geist.</p>
    <p>Not only are in­vestors in the swelling sus­tain­abil­ity sec­tor watch­ing labour re­la­tions more closely, but politi­cians are too.</p>
    <p>The Demo­cratic presidenti­al nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den this week de­clared that “I am go­ing to be the strong­est labour pres­i­dent you have ever had”.</p>
    <p>In­deed, Mr Tef­ere Ge­bre, a top ex­ec­u­tive in the AFL-CIO union, ar­gues that “the 2020 plat­form of the Demo­cratic Party is the most pro-labour it has ever been”.</p>
    <p>And there is a prac­ti­cal is­sue, too: If ris­ing pro­tec­tion­ism in­creases pres­sure to lo­calise pro­duc­tion, then rust-belt ex­ec­u­tives will need union sup­port. A dose of pa­tri­o­tism might help.</p>
    <p>To put it another way, while the pro­duc­tion of ven­ti­la­tors and face masks is in­signif­i­cant in fi­nan­cial terms for a com­pany as large as Ford, the tub-thump­ing lan­guage of lo­cal­i­sa­tion and creative piv­ots might out­last the virus. Think of that the next time you spot a face mask: par­tic­u­larly if it car­ries a “Made in Amer­ica” tag.</p>
