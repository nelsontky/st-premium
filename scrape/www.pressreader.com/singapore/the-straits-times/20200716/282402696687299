    <p>POINTS REAL MADRID NEED FROM TWO GAMES TO WIN LA LIGA</p>
    <p>MADRID • Fol­low­ing Real Madrid’s 2-1 win at Granada on Mon­day night, coach Zine­dine Zi­dane in­sisted that “Real have not won any­thing yet”. But he knows that his team are nearly there.</p>
    <p>The Span­ish La Liga gi­ants kept up their good form with their ninth con­sec­u­tive vic­tory, and a home win against Vil­lar­real to­day would en­sure they win their first topflight ti­tle since 2017.</p>
    <p>With two rounds left, Real are top of the stand­ings on 83 points, four ahead of Barcelona, who host Osasuna to­day. Barca’s bid for their third straight ti­tle would be all over if Real win.</p>
    <p>“Our aim at the start of the sea­son was to try and win the league and ev­ery­thing that was pos­si­ble to win. Now we have two games, al­though we haven’t won it yet,” said Zi­dane.</p>
    <p>“I gave a shout at the end (of the Granada game) be­cause I was happy. It is three vi­tal points for us.</p>
    <p>“My play­ers gave an in­cred­i­ble per­for­mance. Now we have a dif­fi­cult home game against Vil­lar­real, who play re­ally good foot­ball and if we win, then I will say we have won the ti­tle.”</p>
    <p>Real have had a per­fect record since foot­ball re­sumed in Spain last month fol­low­ing the coro­n­avirus hia­tus. They have scored 17 goals and con­ceded just three dur­ing their nine-game win­ning run.</p>
    <p>Zi­dane in­sisted noth­ing had changed dur­ing the months of en­forced stop­page and that it was all down to his play­ers’ men­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>“We have a lot of qual­ity to do things well and our play­ers are pre­pared to win things. We work for this; you want to pre­pare runs of re­sults like this. It is not easy to win nine con­sec­u­tive games and I am very proud of my play­ers,” said the French­man.</p>
    <p>Marcelo and Na­cho are in­jured for to­day’s game, while Luka Jovic is back in the squad fol­low­ing a neg­a­tive Covid-19 test.</p>
    <p>Fifth-placed Vil­lar­real’s 2-1 home loss to Real So­ciedad on Mon­day meant that, with 57 points, they can no longer over­take Atletico Madrid and Sevilla (both on 66), who are now as­sured of Cham­pi­ons League berths for next sea­son.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Barca striker Luis Suarez has ad­mit­ted that it is “al­most im­pos­si­ble” for his team to win the La Liga ti­tle now.</p>
    <p>He added: “In La Liga, you have to be self-crit­i­cal: We let (the ti­tle) es­cape our­selves.</p>
    <p>“Now, for our pride and for the pres­tige of Barca, we have to win the two re­main­ing games and then fo­cus squarely on the only ti­tle we can fight for, which is the Cham­pi­ons League.”</p>
