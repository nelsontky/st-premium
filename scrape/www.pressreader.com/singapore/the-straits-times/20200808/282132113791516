    <p>Even af­ter know­ing that he had symp­toms sim­i­lar to those of a Covid-19 in­fec­tion and hav­ing been is­sued with a stay-home no­tice (SHN), a 47-year-old man left his hos­tel on four oc­ca­sions to run er­rands.</p>
    <p>For his ac­tions in ex­pos­ing oth­ers to a risk of in­fec­tion, Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent Chong Tet Choe was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to two weeks in jail, with the sen­tence de­ferred to Aug 14.</p>
    <p>He had pleaded guilty to three charges un­der the In­fec­tious Dis­eases Act. One other sim­i­lar charge was taken into con­sid­er­a­tion dur­ing sen­tenc­ing by District Judge Tan Jen Tse.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Chong vis­ited Sum­mit Med­i­cal Clinic at Block 134 Jurong Gate­way Road on April 29, com­plain­ing of a cough and body aches.</p>
    <p>He was is­sued a med­i­cal cer­tifi­cate which he was told was also an SHN. He was then in­formed that he should re­main at his res­i­dence – West­wood Hos­tel i n Jurong</p>
    <p>West Av­enue 5 – from April 29 to May 3 and not leave it for any pur­pose ex­cept to seek med­i­cal at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>But Chong left the hos­tel on April 30 to buy gro­ceries and with­draw money at a nearby su­per­mar­ket. He also went to a can­teen near the hos­tel to buy food on two days – May 2 and May 3.</p>
    <p>He left his res­i­dence for a sec­ond time on May 3 to top up the credit stored in his mo­bile phone at an AXS ma­chine.</p>
    <p>Urg­ing the court to im­pose a jail term of three weeks, Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Ken­neth Kee said Chong had ear­lier lied to an of­fi­cer from the Min­istry of Health, say­ing he had left his hos­tel only once.</p>
    <p>It was only af­ter he was shown the ac­cess records of his hos­tel that he con­fessed to his of­fences, the DPP said.</p>
    <p>For each of his of­fences, Chong could have been jailed for up to six months and fined up to $10,000. He could also have been jailed for up to a year and fined up to $20,000 for re­peat of­fences.</p>
