    <p>Reg­is­tered nurse Peng Cheng Yu never imagined that she would one day marry a man 14 years her se­nior, but love won out in the end.</p>
    <p>Ms Peng, 25, and Mr Abra­ham Yeo, 38, tied the knot last Oc­to­ber, about two years af­ter they first met when Ms Peng joined Home­less Hearts of Sin­ga­pore, a vol­un­teer group her new hubby co-founded.</p>
    <p>While Mr Yeo’s age was ini­tially a con­cern for Ms Peng and her par­ents, it was his gen­eros­ity and heart for oth­ers, as well as his mis­sion­ary way of life – choos­ing to serve God and oth­ers – that she also sought to fol­low that changed her mind.</p>
    <p>Ms Peng said she did think about how there would be a good chance of her be­ing wid­owed in the fu­ture due to Mr Yeo be­ing much older, but their com­pat­i­bil­ity in terms of val­ues and life goals sealed the deal.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo pro­posed in April last year af­ter the pair made their re­la­tion­ship of­fi­cial in Jan­uary, fol­low­ing six months of what they termed “ex­plor­ing” more about each other.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo said: “A rea­son we were able to progress at this pace was that we had a clear idea of what we were look­ing for in each other. We know our life goals and the paths we wanted in life are com­pat­i­ble.”</p>
    <p>They also be­lieved that a strong and healthy mar­riage would be the foun­da­tion for a fam­ily. Ms Peng is seven months preg­nant and is ex­pect­ing a girl.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple are also keen to ex­plore adop­tion and fos­ter­ing.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing mar­ried also gives us the op­por­tu­nity to move out into our own space and host peo­ple who need space, such as those who are home­less,” said Ms Peng.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo ac­knowl­edged that he mar­ried later than most of his peers but said his mis­sion­ary way of life meant that he did not have as much fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity as other men, mak­ing it more dif­fi­cult to find a part­ner. Ms Peng is his first girl­friend.</p>
    <p>Ms Peng said: “It’s not that fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity is not im­por­tant, but hav­ing gen­eros­ity to­wards oth­ers is more pre­cious to me.”</p>
