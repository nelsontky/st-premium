    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) re­ported its worst quar­terly show­ing yes­ter­day, with a $1.12 bil­lion net loss in the three months ended June 30.</p>
    <p>De­mand for air travel had plum­meted amid travel re­stric­tions due to Covid-19, the na­tional car­rier said in a reg­u­la­tory fil­ing.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue for the group plunged 79.3 per cent to $851 mil­lion year on year, while ex­pen­di­ture dropped 51.6 per cent to $1.89 bil­lion. Pas­sen­ger car­riage fell across SIA, SilkAir and Scoot, re­sult­ing in a 99.5 per cent de­cline for the com­pany.</p>
    <p>SIA noted that in­ter­na­tional air travel is not re­cov­er­ing as quickly as ex­pected, with the In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion pro­ject­ing slower re­cov­ery in the near term.</p>
    <p>It is re­view­ing its net­work over the longer term, in­clud­ing the fleet size and mix that SIA will need.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) sank deep into the red with a $1.12 bil­lion net loss for the three months ended June 30, its largest quar­terly loss on record, as de­mand plum­meted amid travel re­stric­tions caused by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue for the group plunged to $851 mil­lion, a 79.3 per cent drop from the $4.1 bil­lion in the same pe­riod last year. Ex­pen­di­ture fell 51.6 per cent to $1.89 bil­lion due to lower net fuel cost and cost-sav­ing mea­sures from ca­pac­ity cuts, the com­pany said in a reg­u­la­tory fil­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>SIA had en­tered the first quar­ter “at a time when mar­ket con­di­tions were de­te­ri­o­rat­ing rapidly due to the spread of Covid-19 glob­ally”, the group said. “De­mand for air travel evap­o­rated as travel re­stric­tions and border con­trols were im­posed around the world to con­tain the spread of the virus.”</p>
    <p>Pas­sen­ger car­riage fell across SIA, SilkAir and Scoot, re­sult­ing in a 99.5 per cent de­cline for the com­pany.</p>
    <p>The deep plunge in traf­fic for all three pas­sen­ger air­lines could only be par­tially off­set by im­prove­ments in cargo flown rev­enue, SIA said.</p>
    <p>“The air­freight ca­pac­ity crunch, cou­pled with strong de­mand for ur­gent move­ments of per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment, phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal and fresh foods, brought about a sig­nif­i­cant im­prove­ment in cargo load fac­tor,” SIA said, adding that it has de­ployed pas­sen­ger air­craft on cargo mis­sions to boost cargo ca­pac­ity. But the in­te­gra­tion of SilkAir into the group is on track, it noted.</p>
    <p>On its out­look, SIA noted that in­ter­na­tional air travel is not re­cov­er­ing as quickly as ex­pected, with in­dus­try ex­perts such as the In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion and In­ter­na­tional Civil Avi­a­tion Or­gan­i­sa­tion pro­ject­ing that it will take be­tween two and four years for pas­sen­ger traf­fic num­bers to re­turn to pre-pan­demic lev­els.</p>
    <p>The group’s pas­sen­ger ca­pac­ity by the end of the next quar­ter is pro­jected to be about 7 per cent com­pared with pre-Covid-19 lev­els.</p>
    <p>It fur­ther es­ti­mates that ca­pac­ity may be less than half of preCovid-19 lev­els by the end of this fi­nan­cial year. “We are re­view­ing the shape and size of our net­work over the longer term, given Covid-19 and its im­pact on our pas­sen­ger traf­fic and rev­enue, which will pro­vide clar­ity on fleet size and mix that (SIA) will need.”</p>
    <p>The re­view is ex­pected to be com­pleted by end-Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>The group’s share­hold­ers’ eq­uity at end-June amounted to $17.6 bil­lion, buoyed by an $8.8 bil­lion rights is­sue backed by Te­masek Hold­ings. It also se­cured $750 mil­lion from long-term loans on some of its Air­bus A350-900 and Boe­ing 787-10 planes. In all, SIA has raised about $11 bil­lion in liq­uid­ity since the start of its fi­nan­cial year in April.</p>
    <p>In a re­search re­port yes­ter­day, DBS an­a­lyst Paul Yong urged in­vestors to hold on to the com­pany’s shares. “Given the wide and vary­ing de­grees of suc­cess in flat­ten­ing the curve or man­ag­ing the out­break among var­i­ous coun­tries, we be­lieve that in­ter­na­tional air travel de­mand could take up to a year to grad­u­ally re­cover to preCovid-19 lev­els,” he said.</p>
    <p>The key risk that the com­pany faces is “if travel de­mand re­mains sub­stan­tially sub­dued for a pro­longed pe­riod”, he added. “While air travel de­mand has plunged quickly in re­cent weeks, a pro­longed drop in air travel de­mand will lead to more losses for SIA.”</p>
    <p>PRO­JECT­ING FU­TURE CA­PAC­ITY</p>
    <p>We are re­view­ing the shape and size of our net­work over the longer term, given Covid-19 and its im­pact on our pas­sen­ger traf­fic and rev­enue, which will pro­vide clar­ity on fleet size and mix that (SIA) will need. ’’</p>
