    <p>More than 440 cred­i­tors are owed at least $31.7 mil­lion by depart­ment store Robin­sons, which is clos­ing down its last two stores here at The Heeren and Raf­fles City Shop­ping Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>In a no­tice is­sued to cred­i­tors dated last Fri­day by pro­vi­sional liq­uida­tor Kor­daMen­tha, no in­di­vid­u­als were named as cred­i­tors but it said po­ten­tial em­ployee claims amounted to about $4.4 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The largest amount owed, about $7.2 mil­lion, is to Swee Cheng Hold­ings, the land­lord of Robin­sons’ The Heeren out­let, ac­cord­ing to the no­tice that Kor­daMen­tha re­leased pub­licly yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted, Swee Cheng Hold­ings said it was still in dis­cus­sions with the liq­uida­tor and could not pro­vide more de­tails.</p>
    <p>The next largest amounts of about $4.2 mil­lion each are owed to two more busi­nesses, Lendlease Re­tail In­vest­ment 3 and an en­tity linked to RCS Trust.</p>
    <p>Lendlease is the land­lord of Jem mall, where Robin­sons closed an out­let in Au­gust. RCS Trust owns Raf­fles City where Robin­sons has an­other store.</p>
    <p>Mat­tress com­pa­nies such as Sim­mons, Sealy, Serta and Tem­pur are also among the 442 cred­i­tors listed in the no­tice.</p>
    <p>Sim­mons told The Straits Times</p>
    <p>that the amount it is owed by Robin­sons ex­ceeds the $35,000 recorded in the no­tice but de­clined to dis­close the to­tal sum.</p>
    <p>Mat­tress com­pa­nies are owed money by Robin­sons for mat­tresses con­sumers had paid the depart­ment store for but which they are yet to re­ceive. Six mat­tress com­pa­nies have said they will hon­our the pur­chases by cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Robin­sons said on Oct 30 that it had de­cided to liq­ui­date its The Heeren and Raf­fles City stores due to fac­tors like changing con­sumer tastes and cost pres­sures such as rent. The Covid-19 pan­demic played a part as well, it said.</p>
    <p>Kor­daMen­tha will take con­trol of Robin­sons’ as­sets and as­sess the op­tions to re­alise value to max­imise re­turns to cred­i­tors.</p>
    <p>An on­line cred­i­tors’ meet­ing will be called next Thurs­day to ap­point a com­mit­tee of in­spec­tion to rep­re­sent the in­ter­ests of the cred­i­tors. Dur­ing the meet­ing, cred­i­tors will also re­ceive a state­ment on Robin­sons’ af­fairs.</p>
    <p>Lawyers have said that when</p>
    <p>com­pa­nies wind down, they are bound by the law to pay cred­i­tors such as banks they owe money to or to for­mer em­ploy­ees, with cus­tomers last in line.</p>
    <p>Vet­eran l awyer Amo­lat Singh said com­pa­nies are sep­a­rate le­gal en­ti­ties from their own­ers and share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>“Even when a com­pany goes into liq­ui­da­tion, debts owed by the com­pany will not be borne by its owner or share­hold­ers,” he said.</p>
    <p>Still, the own­ers or share­hold­ers can choose to pay off the debts even though they do not have any le­gal obli­ga­tion, but this rarely hap­pens, he said.</p>
    <p>Dubai-based Al-Fut­taim Group is Robin­sons’ par­ent com­pany. The group owns other fran­chises like Marks & Spencer and Zara.</p>
    <p>Robin­sons’ cred­i­tors have un­til 4pm on Nov 25 to sub­mit doc­u­ments on the amount owed to them to the liq­uida­tor if they want to be el­i­gi­ble to vote at the cred­i­tors’ meet­ing.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, at least 11 for­mer Robin­sons em­ploy­ees have ap­proached the Min­istry of Man</p>
    <p>power (MOM) and the Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Dis­pute Man­age­ment for help after Robin­sons an­nounced its liq­ui­da­tion.</p>
    <p>“They are un­cer­tain about pay­ment of re­trench­ment ben­e­fit, salary in lieu of no­tice and en­cash­ment of un­con­sumed an­nual leave,” an MOM spokesman said.</p>
    <p>MOM said all Robin­sons em­ploy­ees have re­ceived their Oc­to­ber salaries which the re­tailer said ear­lier that it would pay in full.</p>
    <p>A max­i­mum sum of $13,000 can be dis­bursed to each em­ployee by the liq­uida­tor as pro­vided for in the In­sol­vency, Re­struc­tur­ing and Dis­so­lu­tion Act.</p>
    <p>“Claims in ex­cess of $13,000 will be sep­a­rately as­sessed by the liq­uida­tor to­gether with fil­ings from other cred­i­tors,” MOM said.</p>
    <p>Nine for­mer Robin­sons work­ers told ST that they re­ceived their ter­mi­na­tion let­ters at The Heeren on Oct 30 after they at­tended a town hall held vir­tu­ally ear­lier in the day.</p>
    <p>The let­ters, dated Oct 29, in­formed them that Robin­sons could no longer em­ploy them and that</p>
    <p>“the com­pany has im­ple­mented an em­ployee as­sis­tance pro­gramme” con­ducted by hu­man re­source com­pany Per­solKelly Con­sult­ing.</p>
    <p>Many of the for­mer em­ploy­ees are wor­ried about whether they can be com­pen­sated and if they can find an­other job with the cur­rent down­turn due to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>One for­mer em­ployee, who wanted to be known only as Ms Yun, said that she is con­sid­er­ing do­ing part-time jobs at $10 per hour to sup­port her two young chil­dren aged two and six.</p>
    <p>An­other for­mer em­ployee, Ap­ple (not her real name), said she has been able to sleep for only about three hours every night due to stress after be­ing let go.</p>
    <p>“My phone rang non-stop for days after Robin­sons’ an­nounce­ment, with many sup­pli­ers want­ing to know what will hap­pen to them,” she added.</p>
    <p>“I only had time to think about my own sit­u­a­tion three to four days later.”</p>
    <p>A STRESSED-OUT EX-EM­PLOYEE</p>
    <p>My phone rang non-stop for days after Robin­sons’ an­nounce­ment, with many sup­pli­ers want­ing to know what will hap­pen to them... I only had time to think about my own sit­u­a­tion three to four days later.</p>
    <p>AP­PLE (not her real name), a for­mer em­ployee. She says she has been able to sleep for only about three hours every night due to stress after be­ing let go.</p>
