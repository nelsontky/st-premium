    <p>TOKYO • Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga has seen his sup­port rate take its first tum­ble since as­sum­ing of­fice a month ago, over crit­i­cism that he in­jected pol­i­tics into a de­ci­sion to re­ject nom­i­nees for an aca­demic ad­vi­sory coun­cil.</p>
    <p>A poll car­ried out by pub­lic broad­caster NHK be­tween Oct 9 and 11 found sup­port for Mr Suga’s Cab­i­net had fallen by 7 per­cent­age points to 55 per cent, com­pared with the pre­vi­ous month. About 47 per cent of re­spon­dents said his de­ci­sion on the ad­vi­sory board was un­ac­cept­able and many also faulted him over bor­der open­ings that they be­lieve were done too quickly and could spread the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga’s gov­ern­ment has faced a bar­rage of ques­tions over his de­ci­sion to re­ject six of 105 nom­i­nees to the Science Coun­cil of Ja­pan, a gov­ern­ment-funded aca­demic body that makes pol­icy rec­om­men­da­tions. Pre­vi­ous pre­miers had rub­ber-stamped nom­i­na­tions for the coun­cil, es­tab­lished in 1949, and crit­ics have said Mr Suga’s move ap­peared to be aimed at ex­clud­ing crit­ics of gov­ern­ment pol­icy.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has de­nied that pol­i­tics played a part in its de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga was in­stalled as Prime Min­is­ter in Septem­ber, tak­ing over from Mr Shinzo Abe in Ja­pan’s first change of lead­er­ship in al­most eight years. Mr Suga came into power with some of the high­est sup­port rates on record for a new Ja­panese prime min­is­ter, as vot­ers sup­ported his pledges of con­ti­nu­ity for man­ag­ing a coro­n­avirus-bat­tered econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga was elected by the lon­grul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party to serve out the fi­nal year of Mr Abe’s term as party leader af­ter the lat­ter re­signed over health con­cerns.</p>
    <p>No elec­tion need be held un­til Septem­ber next year, and sup­port for the main op­po­si­tion Con­sti­tu­tional Demo­cratic Party of Ja­pan re­mains in sin­gle fig­ures. Still, any rapid fall-off in his sup­port could prompt Mr Suga to bring for­ward the elec­tion to im­prove his chances of win­ning a full three-year term as party leader next year.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Nikkei news­pa­per yesterday re­ported that Mr Suga will or­der his gov­ern­ment to com­pile ex­tra eco­nomic stim­u­lus mea­sures as early as next month.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures could fo­cus on sup­port­ing tourism and the restau­rant in­dus­try from de­clin­ing con­sump­tion, the Nikkei said.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment may also con­sider ex­tend­ing a “Go To Travel” ini­tia­tive to sub­sidise do­mes­tic tourism as part of the stim­u­lus, the Nikkei re­ported, with­out say­ing how it got the in­for­ma­tion.</p>
