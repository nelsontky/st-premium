    <p>A Deutsche Bank state­ment said the trans­ac­tions in ques­tion were “well known to our reg­u­la­tors” and added that it in­vested “bil­lions of dol­lars to more ef­fec­tively sup­port au­thor­i­ties in this ef­fort”.</p>
    <p>Shares of ma­jor banks across bourses world­wide saw losses in the wake of al­le­ga­tions that they had han­dled large amounts of dirty money for al­most 20 years.</p>
    <p>They in­clude HSBC, Deutsche Bank and JPMor­gan Chase, which are among the top banks high­lighted in an in­ves­ti­ga­tion by Buz­zFeed News and the In­ter­na­tional Con­sor­tium of In­ves­tiga­tive Jour­nal­ists that shed light on po­ten­tially du­bi­ous trans­fers worth about US$2 tril­lion (S$2.7 tril­lion) be­tween 1999 and 2017.</p>
    <p>HSBC slipped 2.05 per cent in Hong Kong yes­ter­day, af­ter tum­bling to its low­est level in 25 years on Mon­day when it closed 5.3 per cent lower.</p>
    <p>Stan­dard Char­tered, an­other bank named in the in­ter­na­tional probe, de­clined 2.29 per cent yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In New York, JPMor­gan fell 3.1 per cent on Mon­day fol­low­ing a bruis­ing ses­sion for other large banks named in the re­port.</p>
    <p>In Frank­furt, Deutsche Bank’s stock gave up 8.8 per cent on Mon­day and Stan­dard Char­tered, which is also listed in Lon­don, dropped 5.8 per cent. Both stocks have par­tially re­cov­ered as at 2.30pm GMT yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, DBS fell 1.25 per cent yes­ter­day, while United Over­seas Bank lost 0.99 per cent. OCBC Bank closed 0.71 per cent lower.</p>
    <p>The lo­cal len­ders were named in the leaked files, which noted that banks in Sin­ga­pore han­dled about US$4.5 bil­lion in sus­pi­cious trans­ac­tions be­tween 2000 and 2017.</p>
    <p>The Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore told The Straits Times on Mon­day that it was “closely study­ing” the re­ports and “will take ap­pro­pri­ate ac­tion based on the out­come” of its re­view.</p>
    <p>A re­port by DBS Eq­uity Re­search yes­ter­day noted that global bank stocks had de­clined “in a knee-jerk re­ac­tion to the leaks amid fears over the pos­si­ble im­pli­ca­tions that may in­clude penal­ties”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, any neg­a­tive re­ac­tion among Sin­ga­pore bank stocks should be tem­po­rary, the re­search re­port noted.</p>
    <p>The fall­out was more pal­pa­ble for some banks such as HSBC, which told its staff to stop post­ing on all the bank’s so­cial me­dia ac­counts over fears of “neg­a­tive re­ac­tions” to the rev­e­la­tions.</p>
    <p>In a memo to em­ploy­ees on Mon­day, Ms Tri­cia Weener, head of mar­ket­ing for HSBC’s global com­mer­cial and in­vest­ment bank­ing arms, wrote: “Given the cur­rent news cov­er­age, a de­ci­sion has been taken to pause all HSBC proac­tive so­cial me­dia posts with im­me­di­ate ef­fect (ex­cept for cus­tomer re­sponses i n bank­ing ser­vices) to avoid neg­a­tive re­ac­tions and com­ments across our chan­nels and con­tent.”</p>
    <p>HSBC is one of about 90 banks named in the leaked doc­u­ments. In its case, the bank was said to have pro­cessed mil­lion of dol­lars in trans­ac­tions for a Chi­nese Ponzi scheme, leav­ing vic­tims of the scam unable to re­coup losses.</p>
    <p>The i nves­ti­ga­tion was l ed by more than 100 in­ter­na­tional me­dia out­lets from 88 dif­fer­ent coun­tries and is based on over 2,000 sus­pi­cious ac­tiv­ity re­ports (SARs) sub­mit­ted to the United States Trea­sury Depart­ment’s fi­nan­cial law en­force­ment agency, FinCEN, by banks.</p>
    <p>Five banks – JPMor­gan Chase, HSBC, Stan­dard Char­tered, Deutsche Bank and Bank of New York Mel­lon – were specif­i­cally ac­cused of con­tin­u­ing to move as­sets of al­leged crim­i­nals, even af­ter be­ing fined for ear­lier fail­ures to stem flows of dirty money.</p>
    <p>That said, “SARs are not crime or fraud re­ports, or ev­i­dence of wrong­do­ing, but alerts to po­ten­tial in­stances of eco­nomic crime”, UK Fi­nance, a sec­tor lobby group, told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>“Law en­force­ment may some­times re­quest firms keep a client re­la­tion­ship on­go­ing to sup­port fur­ther in­ves­ti­ga­tions.”</p>
    <p>A Deutsche Bank state­ment said the trans­ac­tions in ques­tion were “well known to our reg­u­la­tors” and added that it in­vested “bil­lions of dol­lars to more ef­fec­tively sup­port au­thor­i­ties in this ef­fort”.</p>
    <p>JPMor­gan said it has em­ployed “thou­sands” of em­ploy­ees and in­vested “hun­dreds of mil­lions of dol­lars” to com­bat il­licit ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>“We have played a lead­er­ship role in anti-money-laun­der­ing re­form that will mod­ernise how the gov­ern­ment and law en­force­ment com­bat money laun­der­ing, ter­ror­ism fi­nanc­ing and other fi­nan­cial crimes,” it said.</p>
    <p>HSBC told its staff to stop post­ing on all the bank’s so­cial me­dia ac­counts over fears of “neg­a­tive re­ac­tions” to the rev­e­la­tions.</p>
    <p>JPMor­gan said it has em­ployed “thou­sands” of em­ploy­ees and in­vested “hun­dreds of mil­lions of dol­lars” to com­bat il­licit ac­tiv­ity.</p>
