    <p>TOKYO • Japan’s gov­ern­ment yes­ter­day urged peo­ple to spend a “quiet” year end af­ter daily coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions hit a new record, but said it would keep pro­vid­ing sub­si­dies to pro­mote tourism de­spite me­dia re­ports that it may pause the cam­paign.</p>
    <p>“The re­ports are not true. We will con­tinue to op­er­ate it in an ap­pro­pri­ate way, striv­ing to pre­vent in­fec­tions spread­ing,” the gov­ern­ment’s top spokesman, Chief Cab­i­net Sec­re­tary Kat­sunobu Kato, said at a reg­u­lar press brief­ing.</p>
    <p>New coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions in Japan reached 2,848 cases on Thurs­day, the most in a sin­gle day.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga said in an on­line town hall that while the con­ta­gion sit­u­a­tion is tense, he was not con­sid­er­ing an im­me­di­ate halt to his sig­na­ture do­mes­tic travel cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal me­dia re­ports had said the ad­min­is­tra­tion was mulling over a pause in the cam­paign for around two months at the year end and into the New Year as pub­lic opin­ion had shifted to sup­port­ing a halt.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga’s gov­ern­ment has so far de­fended the sub­si­dies as be­ing nec­es­sary to keep ho­tels and air­lines in busi­ness and to re­vive an econ­omy hurt by a pan­demic that has kept peo­ple at home.</p>
    <p>At a sep­a­rate brief­ing, Dr Shigeru Omi, chair­man of the gov­ern­ment’s coro­n­avirus re­search panel, out­lined sce­nar­ios that would call for stronger measures, but said that those de­ci­sions would ul­ti­mately have to be made by cen­tral and lo­cal gov­ern­ments.</p>
    <p>A re­port this week from re­searchers at the Univer­sity of Tokyo and Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, Los An­ge­les found a higher in­ci­dence of Covid-19 symp­toms among peo­ple par­tic­i­pat­ing in the travel cam­paign com­pared with the rest of the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts say colder, dryer win­ter weather that keeps peo­ple in­side and helps trans­mis­sion could mean more in­fec­tions, while tra­di­tional year-end and New Year cel­e­bra­tions put peo­ple at greater risk.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­por­tant that cit­i­zens co­op­er­ate a lit­tle by spend­ing a quiet year end and New Year,” Mr Kato said.</p>
    <p>Japan will not be­gin mass in­oc­u­la­tions against the virus un­til next year at the ear­li­est. It has or­dered 290 mil­lion vac­cine doses from Pfizer, As­traZeneca and Moderna and plans to buy 10,500 deep freez­ers to store them in.</p>
