    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong’s econ­omy showed the first signs of emerg­ing from a crip­pling re­ces­sion sparked by po­lit­i­cal un­rest last year and deep­ened by the global pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) de­clined 3.4 per cent in the third quar­ter from a year ear­lier, the govern­ment an­nounced yes­ter­day, bet­ter than the me­dian es­ti­mate of a 5.6 per cent con­trac­tion in a Bloomberg sur­vey of econ­o­mists.</p>
    <p>On a quar­ter-on-quar­ter ba­sis, the GDP rose 3 per cent.</p>
    <p>This marks the first time the quar­ter-on-quar­ter mea­sure has risen since be­fore the start of antigov­ern­ment protests last year, and as a third wave of virus in­fec­tions sub­sided last month.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy has been in its long­est re­ces­sion since the tu­mul­tuous pe­riod from 1997 to 1998, which in­cluded the han­dover to China and the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The mod­er­a­tion in the de­cline in year-on-year GDP stems in part from a low base of com­par­i­son as well as fac­tors in­clud­ing a re­viv­ing main­land China econ­omy, sta­bil­i­sa­tion of the virus in Hong Kong and stronger fi­nan­cial mar­ket ac­tiv­ity, the govern­ment said.</p>
    <p>“Look­ing ahead, the con­tin­ued solid re­cov­ery of the main­land econ­omy should ren­der sup­port to Hong Kong’s ex­ports in the com­ing few months,” the re­port said.</p>
    <p>“Also, global de­mand and trade flows will fur­ther im­prove if the re­cov­ery of the ma­jor ad­vanced economies sus­tains.”</p>
    <p>Still, the re­cov­ery is nascent and Hong Kong will need more ro­bust com­merce and tourism to sus­tain a re­turn to eco­nomic growth, econ­o­mists say.</p>
    <p>Re­vised fig­ures on GDP and more de­tailed statis­tics will be re­leased on Nov 13.</p>
    <p>“Hong Kong needs to see its bor­der re­open­ing with main­land China be­fore the city can ben­e­fit from the rapid re­cov­ery there,” said Dr Tommy Wu, se­nior econ­o­mist at Ox­ford Eco­nomics.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong is among other economies in Asia, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore and South Korea, that are start­ing to re­cover from months of anti-virus mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan also re­ported growth fig­ures yes­ter­day that showed the econ­omy strongly re­bound­ing in the third quar­ter af­ter bring­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic un­der con­trol and ben­e­fit­ing from a tech­nol­ogy boom.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong and Sin­ga­pore have an­nounced plans to cre­ate a travel bub­ble be­tween the two cities that is tar­geted to launch next month, the city’s Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam said at a press brief­ing.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple in both cities would be ex­empted from com­pul­sory quar­an­tine, re­placed by Covid-19 test­ing.</p>
    <p>The pact joins ef­forts in sev­eral mar­kets in the re­gion to loosen travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>In a blog post on Sun­day, Fi­nan­cial Sec­re­tary Paul Chan said if the flow of peo­ple and com­merce be­tween Hong Kong and main­land China is safely re­stored, the city can be “re­vi­talised sub­stan­tially” even if the global econ­omy re­mains con­strained.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam said that the govern­ment is pur­su­ing a law that would make Covid-19 tests manda­tory for some groups even as it slowly eases virus-re­lated curbs.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong is ready to re­open the bor­der with China from a tech­ni­cal per­spec­tive, but it re­quires mu­tual con­sent, she added.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Hong Kong’s ef­forts to stim­u­late the econ­omy re­main un­der scru­tiny.</p>
    <p>The city has an­nounced more than HK$310 bil­lion (S$54.5 bil­lion) in re­lief this year, yet the pro­longed re­ces­sion has led to shut­tered store­fronts and un­em­ploy­ment at an al­most 16-year high of 6.4 per cent as of last month.</p>
    <p>Un­em­ploy­ment is likely to rise fur­ther af­ter Cathay Pa­cific Air­ways last week said that it will slash more than 5,000 jobs and close a re­gional car­rier.</p>
