    <p>•</p>
    <p>They are both crit­i­cally im­por­tant to their do­mes­tic economies, highly re­garded by cus­tomers and very much re­liant on in­ter­na­tional travel. They are also in deep fi­nan­cial strife and shed­ding thou­sands of jobs be­cause of the coro­n­avirus cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Cathay Pa­cific Air­ways and Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) have stood out for over half a cen­tury as avi­a­tion pow­er­houses, pres­ti­gious brands atop a lu­cra­tive mar­ket fu­elled by Asia’s eco­nomic boom.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has se­verely hurt the pair, but Hong Kong-based Cathay is likely in a tougher spot, an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>Cathay an­nounced on Wed­nes­day that it is lay­ing off nearly 6,000 peo­ple and elim­i­nat­ing 2,600 va­cant po­si­tions, which, when com­bined, amount to about 24 per cent of its to­tal work­force.</p>
    <p>It is also shut­ter­ing re­gional air­line Cathay Dragon and re­do­ing con­tracts for pi­lots and cabin crew.</p>
    <p>The goal is to re­duce un­sus­tain­able cash burn by HK$500 mil­lion (S$87.6 mil­lion) a month.</p>
    <p>“In these strait­ened times, we must fo­cus on a sin­gle world-lead­ing pre­mium travel brand – Cathay Pa­cific – com­ple­mented by a sin­gle low-cost leisure travel brand – HK Ex­press,” Cathay chair­man Pa­trick Healy said on Wed­nes­day, re­fer­ring to the bud­get car­rier that the com­pany ac­quired last year.</p>
    <p>Cathay’s shed­ding of jobs fol­lows SIA say­ing last month that it was cut­ting 20 per cent of its work­force, or 4,300 po­si­tions, not long after it raised $11 bil­lion from a rights is­sue and loans.</p>
    <p>Cathay also raised bil­lions of dol­lars in a re­struc­tur­ing ex­er­cise in June that, among other things, re­sulted in the Hong Kong govern­ment get­ting a stake and two ob­server seats on its board.</p>
    <p>In­vestors wel­comed Cathay’s an­nounce­ment on Wed­nes­day – the com­pany’s shares climbed as much as 6.6 per cent in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>“The worst could be over for Cathay with this re­struc­tur­ing,” said Mr K. Ajith, an an­a­lyst at UOB Kay Hian in Sin­ga­pore, who raised his rat­ing on the com­pany to “buy”.</p>
    <p>Yet, the out­look re­mains chal­leng­ing at best, with Cathay warn­ing that it will be op­er­at­ing at well un­der 50 per cent of its pre-pan­demic pas­sen­ger ca­pac­ity next year. And that is its most op­ti­mistic sce­nario.</p>
    <p>SIA is in a bet­ter position be­cause its staff costs are about 20 per cent lower than Cathay’s, said Mr Ajith, who has a “hold” rec­om­men­da­tion on SIA’s shares.</p>
    <p>“We’re ex­pect­ing Sin­ga­pore Air­lines’ earn­ings to show some im­prove­ment in the fis­cal-year sec­ond quar­ter, while for Cathay, it will be in the first half,” he said. “This im­prove­ment in earn­ings for Cathay will be driven by its cargo busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>UN­CER­TAIN FU­TURE</p>
    <p>Pas­sen­ger num­bers have dwin­dled alarm­ingly at both Cathay and SIA, which are more vul­ner­a­ble than most dur­ing this cri­sis as they do not have any do­mes­tic mar­ket to help fill some of the void left by the lack of in­ter­na­tional travel due to border closures.</p>
    <p>“The fu­ture re­mains highly un­cer­tain,” Mr Healy said on Wed­nes­day. “This cri­sis is deeper and the road to re­cov­ery slower and more patchy than any­one thought pos­si­ble just a few short months ago.”</p>
    <p>When SIA an­nounced its job cuts last month, in­clud­ing at its SilkAir and Scoot units, its chief ex­ec­u­tive Goh Choon Phong said it was not clear which air­lines glob­ally would sur­vive.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s flag­ship car­rier ini­tially man­aged to re­sist job losses, thanks to aid from a govern­ment job-sup­port scheme. Like Cathay, SIA dom­i­nates the avi­a­tion in­dus­try in its home mar­ket, with the sec</p>
    <p>tor sup­port­ing more than 12 per cent of the coun­try’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct and 375,000 jobs.</p>
    <p>CHINA PRES­SURE</p>
    <p>Be­yond the sim­i­lar­i­ties lies a strik­ing dif­fer­ence: Cathay has to bal­ance its Hong Kong roots with its ties to Beijing.</p>
    <p>The air­line was crit­i­cised by China last year after its staff took part in anti-govern­ment ral­lies, and then it faced a back­lash for ac­qui­esc­ing to Chi­nese de­mands.</p>
    <p>More broadly, the un­rest in Hong Kong meant Cathay was stuck with a slump in rev­enue prior to the pan­demic as peo­ple re­frained from trav­el­ling to the city.</p>
    <p>Cathay is­sued profit warn­ings to­wards the end of last year and said, even then, that the short-term out­look was chal­leng­ing and un­cer­tain.</p>
    <p>“Hong Kong it­self seems to be los­ing its im­por­tance and rel­e­vance in the greater scheme of things for China, and dis­con­tent there is hurt­ing</p>
    <p>its long-held rep­u­ta­tion as a good, sta­ble place to do busi­ness,” said Mr San­jiv Kapoor, a for­mer head of strat­egy and com­mer­cial op­er­a­tions at Vis­tara, the In­dian af­fil­i­ate of SIA.</p>
    <p>The rise of Chi­nese car­ri­ers also com­pli­cates Cathay’s position as they are ca­pa­ble of en­gag­ing in price wars and could re­duce the rel­e­vance of Hong Kong as a hub with their di­rect flights from the main­land to the United States and Europe.</p>
    <p>While the Sin­ga­pore Govern­ment guar­an­tees that its flag­ship car­rier will not col­lapse, Cathay has to deal with ex­tra geopo­lit­i­cal chal­lenges as China dic­tates rules on land, sea and air, said Mr Shukor Yu­sof, founder of avi­a­tion con­sul­tant En­dau An­a­lyt­ics in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>“I’m not as op­ti­mistic as the air­line’s chair­man that the cuts – large as they ap­pear – will suf­fice to get through Covid-19 in one piece,” he said. “I would bet my money that Sin­ga­pore Air­lines will come out of this stronger.”</p>
