    <p>Coro­n­avirus-hit economies across the Asia-Pa­cific will make a “swoosh-shaped” re­cov­ery next year, the Asian De­vel­op­ment Bank (ADB) fore­cast yes­ter­day, but it warned that fur­ther re­stric­tions to com­bat the con­ta­gion could de­rail the re­gion’s re­turn to growth.</p>
    <p>De­vel­op­ing Asia – stretch­ing from the Cook Is­lands in the Pa­cific to Kaza­khstan in Cen­tral Asia – is ex­pected to con­tract this year for the first time in nearly six decades, throw­ing tens of mil­lions of peo­ple into poverty, the Philip­pines-based lender said.</p>
    <p>The 0.7 per cent shrink­age in gross domestic prod­uct (GDP) com­pares with the bank’s pre­vi­ous es­ti­mate in June for 0.1 per cent growth and will mark “the first re­gional GDP contractio­n since the early 1960s”, it said.</p>
    <p>“The down­turn is across the board, with al­most three-fourths of re­gional economies pro­jected to con­tract – the largest such share in the past six decades,” the bank said in the lat­est up­date to its out­look.</p>
    <p>While the vast re­gion is ex­pected to bounce back next year, with GDP pro­jected to grow 6.8 per cent, it will be “sub­stan­tially smaller” than fore­cast be­fore Covid-19 struck.</p>
    <p>“Thus, the re­gional re­cov­ery will be L-shaped or ‘swoosh-shaped’ rather than V-shaped,” the bank said, not­ing that a pro­longed pan­demic was the main threat to the out­look.</p>
    <p>The bank warned that reim­pos­ing tough virus re­stric­tions could ham­per the re­cov­ery and even trig­ger “fi­nan­cial tur­moil”.</p>
    <p>“While economies in de­vel­op­ing Asia re­main re­silient, con­tin­ued pol­icy sup­port is needed to un­der­pin re­cov­ery,” ADB chief economist Ya­suyuki Sawada said.</p>
    <p>Pol­icy sup­port pack­ages an­nounced to the end of last month had reached a to­tal of US$3.6 tril­lion (S$4.9 tril­lion) – about 15 per cent of re­gional GDP, the bank said.</p>
    <p>China, where the virus first emerged late last year be­fore mor­ph­ing into a pan­demic that has in­fected more than 29 mil­lion peo­ple world­wide, was one of the few economies to buck the down­ward trend in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>After suc­cess­fully beat­ing back the dis­ease, the world’s sec­ond­largest econ­omy is fore­cast to grow 1.8 per cent this year and 7.7 per cent next year, the bank said.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, In­dia, which is one of the hard­est-hit coun­tries in the world with more than 4.8 mil­lion in­fec­tions de­spite lengthy lock­downs, is ex­pected to shrivel by 9 per cent this year, be­fore ex­pand­ing by 8 per cent next year.</p>
    <p>“The path and speed of eco­nomic re­cov­ery in re­gional economies will de­pend on many dif­fer­ent fac­tors, the most im­por­tant of which is abil­ity to con­trol and con­tain the pan­demic,” the ADB said.</p>
    <p>As re­gional economies con­tract this year, the num­ber of poor peo­ple will likely rise by at least 78 mil­lion, re­vers­ing a re­duc­tion in poverty over the past three to four years, ac­cord­ing to the re­port.</p>
    <p>Inflation, how­ever, is ex­pected to re­main “muted”, ow­ing to de­pressed de­mand and lower oil prices, it said.</p>
    <p>An­other rel­a­tive bright spot was trade. While the re­gion’s ex­ports had con­tracted, they had fared bet­ter than the rest of the world, thanks to stronger de­mand for coro­n­avirus-re­lated health sup­plies and elec­tron­ics.</p>
