    <p>Ja­pan’s new de­fence chief Nobuo Kishi shares the same ide­o­log­i­cal vi­sion as his brother Shinzo Abe, and as such, an­a­lysts said, was likely ap­pointed to fur­ther the for­mer prime min­is­ter’s goals.</p>
    <p>The choice of Mr Kishi, 61, caught many an­a­lysts by sur­prise, com­ing af­ter years of him serv­ing in ju­nior po­si­tions – although that might have been a con­scious de­ci­sion on the part of Mr Abe to avoid any hint of nepo­tism.</p>
    <p>His nom­i­na­tion in Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga’s first Cab­i­net this week was also no­table given his close ties with Tai­wan, which China views as a break­away prov­ince.</p>
    <p>In 2015, it was Mr Kishi who ar­ranged a meet­ing be­tween Mr Abe and then Tai­wanese op­po­si­tion leader Tsai Ing-wen, who is now pres­i­dent, in Ya­m­aguchi, the an­ces­tral home town of the broth­ers.</p>
    <p>He most re­cently vis­ited Taipei last month to at­tend the fu­neral of for­mer Tai­wanese pres­i­dent Lee Teng-hui. He also had an au­di­ence with Ms Tsai.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing bris­tled at Mr Kishi’s ap­point­ment, con­grat­u­lat­ing him but adding: “We also hope that Ja­pan will abide by the ‘one China’ prin­ci­ple and avoid any form of of­fi­cial ex­changes with Tai­wan.”</p>
    <p>The new pro-Tai­wan de­fence chief takes over from Mr Taro Kono, now Ad­min­is­tra­tive Re­form Min­is­ter, who last week sin­gled China out as a “se­cu­rity threat”.</p>
    <p>De­fence ob­servers ex­pect Mr Kishi to be hawk­ish on se­cu­rity mat­ters. His pri­or­i­ties will likely be to strengthen the United States-Ja­pan se­cu­rity al­liance, while also push­ing poli­cies that are meant to coun­ter­bal­ance China, like the Free and Open Indo-Pa­cific vi­sion.</p>
    <p>He will also lead the charge for Ja­pan to ac­quire first-strike ca­pa­bil­i­ties, un­der the di­rec­tion set out by Mr Abe in one of his fi­nal acts in of­fice, and will foster closer co­op­er­a­tion among the Quad coun­tries, which in­clude the US, Aus­tralia and In­dia.</p>
    <p>Mr Kishi has in the past ad­vo­cated nu­clear weapons for Ja­pan, but, as De­fence Min­is­ter, on Wed­nes­day said that the na­tion’s nu­clear ar­ma­ment “will never hap­pen”.</p>
    <p>Dr Sa­toru Na­gao, a vis­it­ing fel­low at the Hud­son In­sti­tute, told The Straits Times: “Mr Kishi shares sim­i­lar strate­gic opin­ions with Mr Abe, and will ma­te­ri­alise Mr Abe’s poli­cies.”</p>
    <p>He added: “His close ties with Tai­wan should also be noted when con­sid­er­ing how Chi­nese ag­gres­sion has been push­ing the US to sup­port Tai­wan.”</p>
    <p>Mr Kishi is Mr Abe’s blood brother, but has a dif­fer­ent sur­name be­cause he was adopted into the ma­ter­nal side of the fam­ily when he was born.</p>
    <p>He was raised by his grand­fa­ther, for­mer prime min­is­ter Nobusuke Kishi, who led Ja­pan from 1957 to 1960. The lat­ter was a found­ing mem­ber of the</p>
    <p>Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party, and had pro­posed con­sti­tu­tional re­vi­sion as a key party pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Kishi saw Mr Abe as a cousin un­til his teenage years, when a school as­sign­ment re­quired him to look into his fam­ily registry.</p>
    <p>It was only then that he re­alised he was adopted. “Grow­ing up, I saw my brother as a cousin. Although he knew I was his younger brother, I only knew of him as a cousin and not a sibling,” Mr Kishi once said of their “com­pli­cated re­la­tion­ship”.</p>
    <p>The two broth­ers have in­her­ited con­sti­tu­tional re­vi­sion as a key pri­or­ity, and Kobe Univer­sity se­cu­rity ex­pert Tosh Mi­no­hara ex­pects Mr Kishi to take over the fam­ily man­tle.</p>
    <p>“Kishi will learn the ropes, be­come more of a re­al­ist on such is­sues as nu­clear and push for the Con­sti­tu­tion to be changed,” he said.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Mr Kishi grad­u­ated from the eco­nomics fac­ulty at Keio Univer­sity, he worked as a food trader at global trad­ing firm Su­mit­omo Cor­po­ra­tion from 1981 to 2002. Over the years, he had stints over­seas in the US, Viet­nam and Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>He for­mally en­tered pol­i­tics in 2004, and was elected to the Up­per House to rep­re­sent a district in Ya­m­aguchi pre­fec­ture. He stepped down in 2012 – but only to run for the Lower House for the seat his grand­fa­ther held.</p>
    <p>Mr Kishi has served in numer­ous ju­nior posts, in­clud­ing as par­lia­men­tary vice-min­is­ter of de­fence and state min­is­ter for for­eign af­fairs, mak­ing his jump to the big league a sur­prise to an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>Dr Mi­no­hara said that his sur­name “does help a lot as Kishi 2.0”.</p>
    <p>But he added: “He toes the line, has no ma­jor mis­steps, is in­tel­li­gent and is not a softie. I think it is wrong to as­sume that he was ap­pointed only be­cause he is Abe’s younger brother.”</p>
