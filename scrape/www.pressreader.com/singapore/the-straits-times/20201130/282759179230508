    <p>Ac­tor</p>
    <p>He was crowned Star Search cham­pion in 2007. When he is not act­ing in drama se­ries and movies, he is busy pro­duc­ing videos for his so­cial me­dia chan­nels.</p>
    <p>I was from:</p>
    <p>Tan­glin Sec­ondary School (1999 to 2002).</p>
    <p>My best school mem­o­ries: “I had a lot of ups and downs. I started in the best class and I was one of the top stu­dents. But at the end of Sec­ondary 2, I didn’t do very well for maths. Dur­ing Sec­ondary 3 and 4, I was in a class where the stu­dents were sup­pos­edly bad aca­dem­i­cally.</p>
    <p>“My best school mem­o­ries were ac­tu­ally from those two years with my class­mates and Ms Stacy Low. She was the first teacher whom I felt re­ally be­lieved in us even though we were con­sid­ered ‘the losers’. She also gave us the space to spend time in school af­ter lessons be­cause quite a lot of stu­dents prob­a­bly didn’t come from very good fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>“We had a foos­ball ta­ble and a li­brary cor­ner in our class­room. We’d stay back to read books, chit chat, sing when some­one was play­ing the guitar and just spend time to­gether.</p>
    <p>“She made the en­vi­ron­ment very happy and com­fort­able.”</p>
    <p>One key les­son I’ve learnt:</p>
    <p>“You need just one teacher to be­lieve in you. When I didn’t do well and was de­moted to the last class, I re­ally felt like giv­ing up.</p>
    <p>“Without Ms Low, I’d have re­ally given up. But I bounced back and stud­ied as much as I could. She made a huge dif­fer­ence in my life.”</p>
    <p>If I were a stu­dent again: “I’d work harder to see how the sub­jects are rel­e­vant to my pas­sions so I would be more in­ter­ested in them.”</p>
