    <p>I grow ulam raja (right) in a pot. I har­vested some leaves re­cently, prun­ing the top of the plant. But now, the new leaves look crin­kled at the top as well as at the bot­tom of the stem. What is the right way to prune the plant and how reg­u­larly can I har­vest the leaves? Ang Gerk Kuan</p>
    <p>Your plant does not ap­pear to be suf­fer­ing from nu­tri­ent de­fi­ciency. In­stead, it may be in­fested with broad mites which feed on new leaves and cause them to be­come de­formed.</p>
    <p>Do the af­fected leaves feel stiff and are eas­ily bro­ken apart? The un­der­sides may also ap­pear shiny com­pared with nor­mal leaves.</p>
    <p>Broad mites are com­monly found on chilli plants and if you have in­fested chilli plants nearby, the pests may have been brought over by fly­ing pests such as white­flies.</p>
    <p>Broad mites are mi­cro­scopic and are not vis­i­ble to the naked eye.</p>
    <p>They can be con­trolled with neem oil, sum­mer oil or a ma­trine-based or­ganic pes­ti­cide. Re­peated ap­pli­ca­tions that cover all parts of the plant, es­pe­cially the new emerg­ing fo­liage, are needed to keep the pest in­fes­ta­tion un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>Prune the young leaves reg­u­larly. As the plant is an an­nual, it will die af­ter flow­er­ing and seed­ing for re­pro­duc­tion pur­poses. By prun­ing the young shoots reg­u­larly, you will help pro­long the plant’s life.</p>
