    <p>Repub­li­cans and Democrats dis­agree about many for­eign pol­icy is­sues, but not about the per­cep­tion that the United States risks los­ing to China.</p>
    <p>For the Repub­li­cans, China is an ex­is­ten­tial threat, and Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump warned re­cently about the for­mer US vice-pres­i­dent: “China would own our coun­try if</p>
    <p>Joe Bi­den got elected.”</p>
    <p>For the Democrats, China is a chal­lenge, but man­age­able. Still, Mr Bi­den has pledged that as far as pan­demic pre­pared­ness goes, Amer­ica “will never again be at the mercy of China and other for­eign coun­tries in or­der to pro­tect our own peo­ple”.</p>
    <p>Even if this tough talk is mostly cam­paign trail rhetoric, the next pres­i­dent of the United States should be­ware of cast­ing Amer­ica’s China pol­icy in na­tion­al­is­tic terms.</p>
    <p>Over the long run, Bei­jing’s brand of hy­per­na­tion­al­ism is likely to un­der­mine the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party’s bid for world lead­er­ship; that pos­ture wor­ries too many gov­ern­ments.</p>
    <p>In the short term, though, it is an ef­fec­tive ral­ly­ing cry within China, and Wash­ing­ton must be care­ful not to in­flame the sen­ti­ment – which could com­pel Bei­jing to fur­ther har­den its po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>Na­tion­al­is­tic US poli­cies also com­pli­cate Amer­ica’s ef­forts to mo­bilise its part­ners to push back to­gether against China, and they risk alien­at­ing in­di­vid­u­als of Chi­nese her­itage who con­trib­ute to the dy­namism of the Amer­i­can econ­omy.</p>
    <p>In short: The US gov­ern­ment should not try to out-China China.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has tried to turn the coro­n­avirus pan­demic into a pub­lic re­la­tions op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>De­flect­ing crit­i­cism about its early han­dling of the out­break in Wuhan, it has boasted about its re­sponse at home and its ex­ports of per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment, while crit­i­cis­ing the per­for­mance of West­ern coun­tries.</p>
    <p>In one sur­vey from April of nearly 20,000 peo­ple across China, 81 per cent of re­spon­dents said they were sat­is­fied with the na­tional gov­ern­ment’s “in­for­ma­tion dis­sem­i­na­tion” dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Some 89 per cent said they were sat­is­fied with its pro­vi­sion of “daily ne­ces­si­ties and pro­tec­tion ma­te­ri­als”.</p>
    <p>But Bei­jing’s brag­ging isn’t play­ing so well abroad. Some coun­tries aren’t buying the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment’s nar­ra­tive.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia, for ex­am­ple, has called for a for­mal in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the ori­gins of the pan­demic in China.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Reuters, a think-tank af­fil­i­ated with the Min­istry of State Se­cu­rity warned Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping and top of­fi­cials in April that hos­til­ity to­wards China was at its high­est since the 1989 Tianan­men crack­down.</p>
    <p>And so, even as Bei­jing has scolded for­eign gov­ern­ments for med­dling in what it con­sid­ers to be its in­ter­nal af­fairs, prom­i­nent Chi­nese of­fi­cials – in­clud­ing For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi and China’s chief diplo­mat Yang Jiechi – have been try­ing to mit­i­gate the fall­out of in­creased ten­sions and have sig­nalled an in­ter­est in sta­bil­is­ing US-China ties.</p>
    <p>THE TRICKY ART OF CAL­I­BRA­TION</p>
    <p>Such over­tures are an op­por­tu­nity for Wash­ing­ton to re­cal­i­brate the re­la­tion­ship in its favour, pro­vided it can play Bei­jing’s na­tion­al­ism card right.</p>
    <p>That would mean let­ting China’s chau­vin­is­tic strat­egy bump into its nat­u­ral lim­i­ta­tions, with­out tit-for-tat mea­sures of Amer­ica’s own.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­bra­tion mat­ters. Wash­ing­ton must push back against Bei­jing in ways that Bei­jing can ab­sorb with­out be­ing dis­cred­ited with its do­mes­tic au­di­ence: The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment can­not af­ford to look pas­sive in the face of ap­par­ent provo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, Wash­ing­ton should be more se­lec­tive and more ju­di­cious than the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has been about when and how it con­ducts high-pro­file mil­i­tary pa­trols in the South China Sea or through the Tai­wan Strait.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has played along be­fore, try­ing to sig­nal re­solve while be­ing care­ful to avoid out­right con­fronta­tion, with largely sym­bolic mil­i­tary moves or rhetor­i­cal blus­ter.</p>
    <p>But this is a tricky bal­anc­ing act. Such ges­tures might tem­po­rar­ily ap­pease any jin­go­ism among the Chi­nese pub­lic – or they could nur­ture it over the long run.</p>
    <p>This risk is one rea­son that Wash­ing­ton must do some­thing to dis­suade Bei­jing from play­ing the na­tion­al­ism card, partly by or­gan­is­ing a more uni­fied re­sis­tance with its part­ners in the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ments of Aus­tralia, Ja­pan and South Korea, among oth­ers, have grown in­creas­ingly con­cerned about China’s tru­cu­lence.</p>
    <p>Yet, they do not want to de­cou­ple from China to the same ex­tent as the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has. Nor do they want to be­come in­stru­ments in a pro­tracted US-China com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>But they would be re­cep­tive to greater co­or­di­na­tion with Wash­ing­ton, es­pe­cially if it re­verted to a less uni­lat­eral for­eign pol­icy than Mr Trump’s “Amer­ica First” cam­paign.</p>
    <p>At the same time, Wash­ing­ton should take care not to sug­gest that it seeks regime change in China – or else, it might give Chi­nese cit­i­zens more rea­son to rally around Mr Xi in­stead of de­mand­ing that his gov­ern­ment ad­dress the coun­try’s acute do­mes­tic chal­lenges, such as slow­ing eco­nomic growth and en­vi­ron­men­tal degra­da­tion.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton’s broad reprisals for China’s grow­ing re­pres­sion in Hong Kong could ac­tu­ally hurt the city’s res­i­dents more than the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment, by com­pound­ing their loss of autonomy with fi­nan­cial un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>It would be more use­ful to pro­pose asy­lum poli­cies that would help any refugees from Hong Kong – as well as eth­nic mi­nori­ties per­se­cuted on the main­land – re­set­tle in the US.</p>
    <p>DAN­GER OF TRAVEL BANS</p>
    <p>The US gov­ern­ment should also tone down its na­tion­al­ism at home. Sweep­ing re­stric­tions on Chi­nese stu­dents and trav­ellers in the United States can look like at­tacks on the whole of the Chi­nese peo­ple.</p>
    <p>There are more pro­por­tion­ate re­sponses to, say, sus­pected crim­i­nal ac­tiv­ity by some in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>And many Chi­nese stu­dents in the US con­trib­ute enor­mously to Amer­ica’s com­pet­i­tive­ness in fron­tier tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion is re­ported to be con­sid­er­ing ban­ning all Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party mem­bers and their fam­i­lies from trav­el­ling to the United States.</p>
    <p>But the party counts roughly 92 mil­lion ad­her­ents – the equiv­a­lent of about 28 per cent of the US pop­u­la­tion – and many of them joined it more to fur­ther their ca­reer prospects than out of ide­o­log­i­cal con­vic­tion.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton’s best re­sponse to Mr Xi’s in­creas­ingly na­tion­al­is­tic and au­thor­i­tar­ian China is to adopt an asym­met­ric ap­proach – re­vi­tal­is­ing the re­la­tion­ships that have long an­chored US diplo­macy while reaf­firm­ing the United States’ demo­cratic val­ues and in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can na­tion­al­ism will only beget more Chi­nese na­tion­al­ism, and that would hurt the United States, es­pe­cially in the short term.</p>
    <p>Bet­ter to let China’s strat­egy run its course, or run aground, on its own.</p>
