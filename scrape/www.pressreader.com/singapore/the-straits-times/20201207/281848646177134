    <p>The an­nounce­ment of Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s long-time aide Antony Blinken as his choice of secretary of state last month was wel­comed by the for­eign pol­icy es­tab­lish­ment in Asia and Europe, and likely greeted with some mea­sure of wari­ness in China.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s se­lec­tion for his top diplo­mat her­alds a more cal­i­brated but still ro­bust ap­proach to strate­gic com­pe­ti­tion with China that leaves room for co­op­er­a­tion on com­mon chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>The key to this is al­lies. In public events and com­men­taries in re­cent years, Mr Blinken has con­sis­tently es­poused his world view: Amer­ica’s strength lies in its abil­ity to rally al­lies and part­ners to­gether to­wards a com­mon cause. “We need to rally our al­lies and part­ners in­stead of alien­at­ing them to deal with some of the chal­lenges that China poses,” Mr Blinken said at the Hud­son In­sti­tute think-tank in July.</p>
    <p>He cited, as he fre­quently does, how Amer­ica forms about a quar­ter of the world’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct by it­self. But in­clud­ing al­lies and part­ners in the mix can bring this fig­ure up to 50 per cent or 60 per cent of the global economy, which is “a lot more weight and a lot harder for China to ig­nore”.</p>
    <p>Mr Blinken, 58, can be re­lied on to know how Mr Bi­den thinks. The two men go way back, with Mr Blinken serv­ing from 2002 to 2008 as staff direc­tor of the Se­nate For­eign Re­la­tions Com­mit­tee which Mr Bi­den chaired then. Like Mr Blinken, Mr Bi­den also made clear in an in­ter­view with The New York Times last week that al­lies will be front and cen­tre in deal­ing with China.</p>
    <p>The best China strat­egy, said Mr Bi­den, was one in which ev­ery one of Amer­ica’s al­lies were on the same page, adding that this align­ing would be a “ma­jor pri­or­ity” in the open­ing weeks of his pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>For Asia, where many coun­tries want sus­tained en­gage­ment with Amer­ica, Mr Blinken – as part of the team be­hind the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion’s re­bal­ance to Asia – is well poised to de­liver on that de­mand.</p>
    <p>For Europe, where mo­men­tum is build­ing to­wards a re­newed transat­lantic al­liance, Mr Blinken’s strong ties to the con­ti­nent put him in good stead to strengthen co­op­er­a­tion against com­mon China chal­lenges, say an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>MORE EN­GAGE­MENT WITH ASIA</p>
    <p>Mr Blinken, the step­son of a Holo­caust sur­vivor, be­lieves deeply in hu­man rights and has a lib­eral in­ter­na­tion­al­ist streak. Over his two decades as a se­nior for­eign pol­icy of­fi­cial in the Clin­ton and Obama ad­min­is­tra­tions, he has also built a rep­u­ta­tion for be­ing a mild-man­nered diplo­mat with a strong be­lief in the im­por­tance of in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion, both as­sets in deal­ing with Euro­peans and other al­lies af­ter their bruis­ing ex­pe­ri­ence with the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Blinken has said that a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion would see more em­pha­sis on the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion, and views co­op­er­a­tion with Asean as crit­i­cal.</p>
    <p>“Asean is es­sen­tial to tack­ling ma­jor chal­lenges like cli­mate change and global health, and cen­tral to south-east Asia’s pros­per­ity and se­cu­rity. Pres­i­dent Bi­den will show up and en­gage Asean on crit­i­cal is­sues of com­mon in­ter­est,” Mr Blinken wrote on Twit­ter on Asean’s 53rd an­niver­sary in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>In an­other in­di­ca­tion of the im­por­tance the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion places in Asia and in con­fronting China, Mr Bi­den is con­sid­er­ing ap­point­ing a White House “Asia czar”, the Fi­nan­cial Times re­ported last Wed­nes­day. The role is one of sev­eral ideas be­ing con­sid­ered by Mr Jake Sul­li­van, Mr Bi­den’s choice for na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser, said the Fi­nan­cial Times.</p>
    <p>Mr Blinken and Mr Sul­li­van will recog­nise that they need to not alien­ate South-east Asian coun­tries that they want to rope in to counter China, said Coun­cil on For­eign Re­la­tions se­nior fel­low for South-east Asia Joshua Kurlantz­ick.</p>
    <p>One side ef­fect of that recog­ni­tion will be an eas­ing of trade dis­putes with Viet­nam, which the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has ac­cused of cur­rency ma­nip­u­la­tion, and other coun­tries in the re­gion such as Thai­land and In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>“There will be some­thing of a back­ing off of that and the recog­ni­tion that you can’t, on the one hand, try to gain part­ners... while at the same time alien­at­ing coun­tries in the re­gion,” Mr Kurlantz­ick told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Un­der Mr Bi­den, the re­gion is likely to see a con­tin­u­a­tion, if not a step­ping up, of Amer­ica’s mil­i­tary pres­ence in the re­gion as a counter to China’s in­creas­ing as­sertive­ness and mil­i­tari­sa­tion in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>Mr Blinken ad­vo­cated for sus­tain­able de­ter­rence in a</p>
    <p>For­eign Af­fairs ar­ti­cle in Septem­ber last year, ar­gu­ing for co­ex­is­tence in the Indo-Pa­cific by both mil­i­taries amid ris­ing ten­sions. “The United States must ac­cept that mil­i­tary pri­macy will be dif­fi­cult to re­store, given the reach of China’s weapons, and in­stead, fo­cus on de­ter­ring China from in­ter­fer­ing with its free­dom of ma­noeu­vre and from phys­i­cally co­erc­ing US al­lies and part­ners,” he wrote to­gether with for­mer se­nior diplo­mat and Asia spe­cial­ist Kurt Camp­bell.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Bei­jing will have to ac­cept that the US will re­main a res­i­dent power in the re­gion, with a ma­jor mil­i­tary pres­ence, naval op­er­a­tions in its ma­jor wa­ter­ways, and a net­work of al­liances and part­ner­ships, they added.</p>
    <p>Mr Sul­li­van has rued the soft ap­proach of the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion – un­der which he was Mr Bi­den’s na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser – to China’s recla­ma­tion and mil­i­tari­sa­tion of is­land fea­tures in the South China</p>
    <p>Sea.</p>
    <p>The Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion said such be­hav­iour was un­ac­cept­able, but should have done more to en­force that line in the sand, he said in an in­ter­view with Chi­naTalk pod­cast host Jor­dan Sch­nei­der late last year. “We should be de­vot­ing more as­sets and re­sources to en­sur­ing and re­in­forc­ing, and hold­ing up along­side our part­ners, the free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion in the South China Sea. That puts the shoe on the other foot, China then has to stop us, which they will not do,” said Mr Sul­li­van.</p>
    <p>But the US may be too late, said Mr Kurlantz­ick. “China’s land recla­ma­tion build-up and other ef­forts in the South China Sea have al­ready been so ex­ten­sive that even if the US takes a fairly as­sertive ap­proach, I’m not cer­tain they can stop China,” he said.</p>
    <p>A RE­NEWED TRANSAT­LANTIC AL­LIANCE</p>
    <p>Co­op­er­a­tion be­tween the US and Europe will per­haps see much more move­ment, with Mr Blinken be­ing a key as­set in this re­gard.</p>
    <p>The 58-year-old has strong ties to the con­ti­nent, hav­ing lived in Paris as a child af­ter his mother moved there with his Pol­ish-Amer­i­can step­fa­ther. His fa­ther and un­cle were US am­bas­sadors to Hun­gary and Bel­gium re­spec­tively, and Mr Blinken speaks flu­ent French.</p>
    <p>Mr Blinken has de­scribed</p>
    <p>Europe as a part­ner of “first re­sort, not last re­sort, when it comes to con­tend­ing with the chal­lenges we face”, and said that revalu­ing these al­liances, start­ing with the North At­lantic Treaty Or­gan­i­sa­tion, would be “very, very im­por­tant to a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion”.</p>
    <p>At the same time, Europe ap­pears keen to work with the US. The Euro­pean Union’s ex­ec­u­tive arm is re­port­edly work­ing on a pa­per propos­ing a fresh al­liance with the US to shape the dig­i­tal reg­u­la­tory en­vi­ron­ment. “As open demo­cratic so­ci­eties and mar­ket economies, the EU and the US agree on the strate­gic chal­lenge pre­sented by China’s grow­ing in­ter­na­tional as­sertive­ness, even if we do not al­ways agree on the best way to ad­dress this,” the Fi­nan­cial Times cited from the pa­per.</p>
    <p>To­gether, this in­di­cates a strong mo­men­tum for Europe and the US to form a joint front that can counter China, par­tic­u­larly on tech­nol­ogy stan­dards, but also trade and other is­sues, said an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>Cen­tre for a New Amer­i­can Se­cu­rity se­nior fel­low Mar­tijn Rasser said: “You can tell on the side of the in­com­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion that there’s a lot of ap­petite for fresh think­ing and new ap­proaches to deal­ing with tech­nol­ogy pol­icy in the con­text of the China chal­lenge.”</p>
    <p>The public pro­nounce­ments of Bi­den nom­i­nees have been a clear sig­nal to al­lies and part­ners of how the ad­min­is­tra­tion is think­ing about tech­nol­ogy is­sues, and the EU is also sig­nalling its open­ness to hav­ing those dis­cus­sions, he added.</p>
    <p>To be sure, the US and EU have ar­eas of dis­agree­ment, in­clud­ing data pri­vacy, data gov­er­nance and the world of big tech. “But these aren’t in­sur­mount­able ob­sta­cles,” said Mr Rasser.</p>
    <p>The US and the EU are also em­broiled in sev­eral trade dis­putes, but Mr An­thony</p>
    <p>Gard­ner, an Obama-era am­bas­sador to the EU and a long-time child­hood friend of Mr Blinken, said last week that he was op­ti­mistic these tit-for-tat tar­iff spats could be re­solved.</p>
    <p>“I would like to see us have a truce... giv­ing us some time to clear the decks and hope­fully, start anew, so we can fo­cus on what re­ally mat­ters. And what re­ally mat­ters is China, China, China, (and) WTO (World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion) re­form,” said Mr Gard­ner dur­ing a we­bi­nar by the Re­new Europe group of EU par­lia­men­tar­i­ans.</p>
    <p>Work­ing to­gether to align stan­dards in the tech­nolo­gies of the fu­ture, in­clud­ing fa­cial recog­ni­tion, vis­ual sur­veil­lance and au­ton­o­mous ve­hi­cles “should be doable”, he added.</p>
    <p>These is­sues will likely be given pri­or­ity by Mr Blinken, who has called “the fault line be­tween techno-democ­ra­cies and techno-au­toc­ra­cies like China” one of the defin­ing is­sues of the time.</p>
    <p>“Whose norms, whose val­ues – to the ex­tent tech­nol­ogy is in­fused with val­ues – carry the day is go­ing to make a huge dif­fer­ence in the lives of peo­ple across this planet,” he said on the In­tel­li­gence Mat­ters pod­cast this Septem­ber. “We have to do a much bet­ter job in lead­ing, co­or­di­nat­ing, work­ing with the other techno-democ­ra­cies to make sure that we carry the day and not China,” he said.</p>
    <p>THE PUSH TO­WARDS MUL­TI­LAT­ER­AL­ISM</p>
    <p>Much like Asia, Europe has its own reser­va­tions about Amer­ica’s con­fronta­tion of China.</p>
    <p>“The Euro­peans are now in the very, very dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tion of look­ing at a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion whose ca­pa­bil­ity to act, they think, will be sig­nif­i­cantly con­strained by do­mes­tic con­flicts, and a China which they in­creas­ingly see as a strate­gic ri­val and as a se­cu­rity threat to them,” Dr Con­stanze Stelzen­mueller, a se­nior fel­low in the Cen­tre on the United States and Europe at the Brook­ings In­sti­tu­tion, said at a re­cent we­bi­nar.</p>
    <p>“They’re both trau­ma­tised by four years of Trump and want to em­brace the Bush ad­min­is­tra­tion, but they also fear an Amer­i­can strat­egy of con­tain­ment or de­cou­pling that would force them to choose,” she added.</p>
    <p>But what the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion has go­ing for it is Bei­jing’s own be­hav­iour. China’s on­go­ing trade spat with Aus­tralia has not gone un­no­ticed in coun­tries like In­dia or Europe, and will drive a push to­wards mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism, said Mr Rasser.</p>
    <p>Amid the es­ca­lat­ing spat, Mr Sul­li­van made a clear state­ment of sol­i­dar­ity with Aus­tralia on Twit­ter, writ­ing: “Amer­ica will stand shoul­der to shoul­der with our ally Aus­tralia and rally fel­low democ­ra­cies to ad­vance our shared se­cu­rity, pros­per­ity and val­ues.”</p>
    <p>Mr Rasser said: “There’s a lot of public worry and wari­ness about Chi­nese for­eign pol­icy at the mo­ment. So I think be­yond the EU-US re­la­tion­ship, you’ll be see­ing a push to­wards a broader mul­ti­lat­eral ap­proach on these is­sues.</p>
    <p>“What I think is be­ing un­der­es­ti­mated in Bei­jing right now is how sig­nif­i­cant the ap­petite of their lib­eral demo­cratic coun­tries is for this type of ap­proach,” he added.</p>
