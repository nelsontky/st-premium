    <p>Sourc­ing agent James Liu used to host at least five for­eign cus­tomers a month in Yiwu, the city known as the “hy­per­mart of the world”, where colos­sal whole­sale cen­tres run on for kilo­me­tres.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the coron­avirus pan­demic hit and China shut its bor­ders in late March, he has not made any air­port runs to pick up clients who come on buy­ing trips.</p>
    <p>His com­pany, Gold­en­shiny Trad­ing, de­pends heav­ily on in­ter­na­tional buy­ers from Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia, the United States, as well as African and Mid­dle East­ern states, much like most of the more than 70,000 traders in Yiwu’s In­ter­na­tional Trade City.</p>
    <p>The trade city has five in­ter­linked blocks that sell ev­ery­thing from bras to toys to hard­ware, as well as the world’s largest small-com­modi­ties whole­sale mar­ket span­ning nearly 1,000 foot­ball fields.</p>
    <p>“We’re hav­ing a hard time, but I’m telling my cus­tomers, even if you can’t come to China, we can still get the job done for you,” said Mr Liu, 34, a Ningbo na­tive who used to take his cus­tomers to the whole­sale cen­tres to source goods as well as han­dle their qual­ity con­trol and ship­ping.</p>
    <p>China has been trum­pet­ing its eco­nomic re­vival af­ter stamp­ing out the virus as noth­ing less than dra­matic, and the of­fi­cial data shows: Its econ­omy grew by 4.9 per cent in the lat­est quar­ter, up from 3.2 per cent in the se­cond quar­ter and af­ter shrink­ing by 6.8 per cent in the first three months of the year.</p>
    <p>Its gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) is ex­pected to ex­pand by 1.9 per cent this year, mak­ing it the only ma­jor econ­omy in the world set to have pos­i­tive growth in 2020.</p>
    <p>In­vest­ments and ex­ports of med­i­cal de­vices and elec­tronic goods are driv­ing this rapid re­cov­ery, but for Yiwu’s ex­port-re­liant traders, their small com­modi­ties do not count for much.</p>
    <p>As much as 70 per cent of their busi­ness comes from sell­ing their wares over­seas, and while the first half of the year was a washout, most say they have at least made a 70 per cent re­cov­ery now.</p>
    <p>Mr Miao Qu, 47, who sells plas­tic pack­ag­ing, says the out­break has wiped off a third of his rev­enue this year.</p>
    <p>“For­eign­ers can’t get in, there are ba­si­cally no new cus­tomers, only old cus­tomers” who are mostly from the Mid­dle East and Malaysia, he said. “I just hope I can keep the busi­ness go­ing for the rest of this year, but who knows when this pan­demic will blow over?”</p>
    <p>Where the whole­sale cen­tres used to bus­tle with life as buy­ers from around the world pick their goods from shop to shop, cor­ri­dors are now empty ex­cept for idle shop­keep­ers who sit on low stools chat­ting with one an­other.</p>
    <p>On a stretch of Cheng­bei Street near the trade city known as Yiwu’s “lit­tle In­dia”, shops lie empty. In­dian traders, among the largest group of buy­ers, have not been in town for months.</p>
    <p>Even though the au­thor­i­ties have lifted some travel re­stric­tions, for­eign traders are re­luc­tant to serve out 14 days of quar­an­tine in China, which is still manda­tory.</p>
    <p>In many cases, over­seas or­ders have sim­ply stopped be­cause no one is buy­ing th­ese goods at the other end. There are also dif­fi­cul­ties clear­ing Cus­toms in var­i­ous coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Last year, Yiwu, a county-level city of 1.2 mil­lion in Zhe­jiang prov­ince, saw its to­tal trade value hit 296.7 bil­lion yuan (S$60.6 bil­lion), dou­ble its GDP.</p>
    <p>Its econ­omy, which took off af­ter para­mount leader Deng Xiaop­ing launched sweep­ing eco­nomic</p>
    <p>re­forms in 1978, has grown nearly 8 per cent from 2018.</p>
    <p>Africa and the Mid­dle East were its two largest trad­ing mar­kets by value, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial data.</p>
    <p>But as ex­port de­mand plunged dra­mat­i­cally in the wake of the Covid-19 out­break, the Yiwu gov­ern­ment ca­joled traders to fo­cus on the do­mes­tic mar­ket in­stead, rop­ing in so­cial me­dia in­flu­encers to help them pro­mote their wares on live-stream­ing plat­forms like TikTok and Kuaishou.</p>
    <p>As early as Feb 18, barely three weeks af­ter Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping called the out­break – which orig­i­nated in the cen­tral city of Wuhan – a “grave sit­u­a­tion” and the coun­try waged war against the virus, Yiwu re­opened its mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The lo­cal gov­ern­ment char­tered buses and trains to pick up work­ers who had left the city. It even of­fered free ac­com­mo­da­tion and flight tick­ets in a bid to lure in for­eign buy­ers.</p>
    <p>As the pan­demic raged across the world, the Yiwu au­thor­i­ties stepped i n again and pro­vided three-month rent waivers to traders at the mar­ket, as well as in­ter­est-free loans.</p>
    <p>Two weeks ago, the mar­ket launched an on­line plat­form, www.chi­na­goods.com, that show­cases its traders’ sup­plies in what has been de­scribed as “a key step towards dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion”.</p>
    <p>“Con­di­tions are chang­ing and we have to adapt. Our prod­ucts don’t change but our sales chan­nels have to change,” said Mr Zhou Xiongxin, 45, who sells gar­ment trims in the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>As the coun­try em­barks on a “dual cir­cu­la­tion” eco­nomic strat­egy that will make it less re­liant on for­eign trade and more on the do­mes­tic mar­ket, and as re­sources are poured into de­vel­op­ing tech­no­log­i­cal self-reliance, Yiwu’s tra­di­tional traders are feel­ing left out.</p>
    <p>“In the eyes of the gov­ern­ment, small-com­modi­ties traders like us are neg­li­gi­ble. The gov­ern­ment is fo­cused on the high-tech in­dus­try,” said Mr Wu Guo­jie, pres­i­dent of the Yiwu Ac­ces­sories and Jew­ellery In­dus­try As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“If you watch TV, you’ll see that it’s all about how we have bounced back and the econ­omy has re­turned to what it was last year. But that’s not how we feel. We’re still suf­fer­ing.”</p>
    <p>Yiwu’s traders are re­luc­tant to heed the call of their Chi­nese lead­ers and get on the “dual cir­cu­la­tion” band­wagon.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhou said: “There is do­mes­tic de­mand, but those who used to sell to the do­mes­tic mar­ket con­tinue to do so, while those who used to sell over­seas now have to turn their at­ten­tion to the do­mes­tic mar­ket, and that cre­ates huge pres­sure with sup­ply out­strip­ping de­mand.”</p>
    <p>Profit mar­gins are also lower. Mr Chen Xiaom­ing, 58, used to sell cos­met­ics, nail pol­ish and hair ac­ces­sories to the Chi­nese mar­ket, but found that he could earn much more trad­ing with Rus­sia, Kaza­khstan and Ukraine.</p>
    <p>“Those years of sup­ply­ing to the do­mes­tic mar­ket were tir­ing, and at my age, I sim­ply don’t have the en­ergy to do it all over again,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The big­gest chal­lenge now is the un­sta­ble sit­u­a­tion with the ex­port mar­ket. If I can’t hold out any longer, I’ll dip into my savings.</p>
    <p>“In the worst-case sce­nario, I’ll give up my busi­ness, pick up a hoe and go farm.”</p>
    <p>The sourc­ing agent, Mr Liu, is more op­ti­mistic.</p>
    <p>His YouTube chan­nel fea­tur­ing videos of him tak­ing for­eign buy­ers around the mar­ket has brought him new cus­tomers dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He spends 20,000 yuan a month to boost his Google search rank­ing.</p>
    <p>Agents like him have re­duced their com­mis­sion, typ­i­cally 3 per cent, to at­tract new clients.</p>
    <p>But the storm will pass, he says. “Uten­sils, garbage bins, house­hold ap­pli­ances. Peo­ple need them in good and bad times. That is why Yiwu can sus­tain it­self for so many years.”</p>
