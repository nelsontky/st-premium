    <p>Two for­mer Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) MPs who left pol­i­tics this year have taken on new roles.</p>
    <p>Dr Lam Pin Min, for­mer se­nior min­is­ter of state for trans­port and health, has joined car rental firm Lu­mens Auto as a se­nior ad­viser, while union­ist Ang Hin Kee has been ap­pointed chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Co­op­er­a­tive Fed­er­a­tion (SNCF).</p>
    <p>For Dr Lam, 51, an oph­thal­mol­o­gist, the new role is on top of be­ing the CEO and di­rec­tor of pae­di­atric oph­thal­mol­ogy at Ea­gle Eye Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>His move to the pri­vate sec­tor fol­lows the PAP team’s de­feat by the Work­ers’ Party in Sengkang GRC at the July 10 Gen­eral Elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Lam, who be­came an MP in 2006, said in a Face­book post on Tues­day that his work at Lu­mens Auto in­volves ad­vanc­ing the com</p>
    <p>pany’s busi­ness devel­op­ment and growth.</p>
    <p>He told The Straits Times (ST) yes­ter­day that although he is now “un­able to con­trib­ute at min­istry-level, I am still pas­sion­ate about play­ing a role in help­ing the in­dus­try nav­i­gate through this chal­leng­ing pe­riod”.</p>
    <p>“I hope, with my ex­pe­ri­ence in the trans­port sec­tor and my un­der­stand­ing of the eco­nomic and health im­pact of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, I would be able to help Lu­mens Auto shape its pol­icy and plan­ning.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany sup­plies cars to the pri­vate-hire in­dus­try, whose ma­jor play­ers in­clude Grab and Go­jek. It said Dr Lam would, among other things, help strengthen its part­ner­ships with key stake­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Ang, 55, who is as­sis­tant di­rec­tor-gen­eral of the Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC), will helm SNCF from Sun­day, the fed­er­a­tion said yes­ter­day. It is the apex body for Sin­ga­pore’s co­op­er­a­tive move­ment, whose en­ter­prises pro­vide help in ar­eas such as healthcare, daily es­sen­tials, ed­u­ca­tion and train­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Ang, who chose not to con­test this year’s polls af­ter be­ing an MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC for nine years, told ST there is “syn­ergy” be­tween his SNCF ap­point­ment and his role at NTUC, in terms of do­ing good for the com­mu­nity. “I hope to use what I’ve done in the po­lit­i­cal and union fields to broaden the out­reach of the co­op­er­a­tives,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ang said the pan­demic un­der­scored the so­cial role of co­op­er­a­tives in help­ing mem­bers tide over dif­fi­cult times. “Covid-19 presents op­por­tu­ni­ties for the co­op­er­a­tive move­ment to help build a new nor­mal that is more car­ing and in­clu­sive,” he added.</p>
