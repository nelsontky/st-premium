    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK Some of Wall Street’s big­gest play­ers view the mar­ket’s re­cent tech-led sell-off as a bout of tur­bu­lence rather than the start of a longer slide – and they do not see it as a rea­son to run for the door.</p>
    <p>In­vesco this week called the sharp fall in the Nas­daq a “healthy pe­riod of con­sol­i­da­tion”, while fund man­ager Lord Ab­bett said US stock val­u­a­tions are likely mer­ited, based on an anal­y­sis of firms’ earn­ings.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, Gold­man Sachs re­it­er­ated its year-end price tar­get of 3,600 on the S&P 500, about 6 per cent above its close this Wed­nes­day. UBS Global Wealth Man­age­ment rec­om­mended clients “ease into the mar­kets” rather than stay on the side­lines.</p>
    <p>Their op­ti­mism high­lights how the Fed­eral Re­serve’s pledge to keep in­ter­est rates at record lows and hopes of a break­through in a vac­cine for Covid-19 have un­der­pinned mar­ket gains this year.</p>
    <p>But many re­main wary that the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion and huge op­tions bets on tech-re­lated stocks could ex­ac­er­bate mar­ket swings for the rest of the year.</p>
    <p>“What we think we are go­ing through is a healthy cor­rec­tion, re­mov­ing the froth,” said Mr Troy Gayeski, co-chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer of Sky­Bridge Cap­i­tal, an in­vest­ment firm. “We cer­tainly could fall more. But if you’re a tech in­vestor, you had to un­der­stand that the val­u­a­tions were very high.”</p>
    <p>The Nas­daq posted its best day since April on Wed­nes­day, a day af­ter fall­ing into cor­rec­tion ter­ri­tory, de­fined as a fall of 10 per cent or more from a re­cent peak. The other ma­jor in­dexes also re­bounded on Wed­nes­day af­ter steep de­clines.</p>
    <p>“I think of this rout not so much as a cor­rec­tion, but as a di­ges­tion,” In­vesco’s chief global mar­ket strate­gist Kristina Hooper said in a note.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond-quar­ter re­ported earn­ings on the S&P 500 were 23.1 per cent above ex­pec­ta­tions, far above the trail­ing five-year av­er­age of 4.7 per cent, an­a­lysts at Lord Ab­bett said in a re­cent note.</p>
    <p>“Earn­ings mo­men­tum, and the</p>
    <p>mag­ni­tude of an­a­lyst earn­ings re­vi­sions, is out­pac­ing that in other mar­kets, sug­gest­ing that higher val­u­a­tions on US eq­ui­ties are mer­ited,” the re­port said.</p>
    <p>Still, some ex­pect more volatil­ity ahead. A re­cent poll of UBS Global</p>
    <p>Wealth Man­age­ment in­vestors showed 65 per cent viewed pol­i­tics as their top con­cern, with the Nov 3 US elec­tion just weeks away.</p>
    <p>Prom­i­nent in­vestor Stan­ley Druck­en­miller – a scep­tic of this year’s rally – again sounded a bear</p>
    <p>ish note on Wed­nes­day, warn­ing on CNBC that the mar­ket is in a ma­nia fu­elled by the US cen­tral bank.</p>
    <p>Un­cer­tainty over huge op­tions pur­chases by SoftBank Group also hung over mar­kets, cre­at­ing another risk.</p>
    <p>Sky­Bridge’s Mr Gayeski said he could see an op­por­tu­nity to in­crease eq­uity risk if there was a sharper drop, such as the Nas­daq fall­ing 20 per cent or the S&P 500 de­clin­ing 15 per cent from their re­spec­tive highs and there were other sup­port­ive signs for the mar­ket such as the Fed’s ex­pand­ing its bal­ance sheet fur­ther.</p>
    <p>Any sell­ing that spreads be­yond the big tech-re­lated stocks that have led mar­kets higher could be an in­di­ca­tion that the pull­back may be ex­tend­ing fur­ther, said Mr Wil­lie Del­wiche, an in­vest­ment strate­gist at Baird. In the com­ing days, he will be look­ing for signs of in­creas­ing in­vestor cau­tion – such as buy­ing of put op­tions, out­flows from eq­uity funds and di­min­ish­ing bullish views in sur­veys – that in­di­cate any overex­u­ber­ance has waned.</p>
    <p>Another i ndi­ca­tor is how i nvestors re­spond to key tech­ni­cal sup­port lev­els, said Mr Keith Lerner, chief mar­ket strate­gist for Truist/SunTrust Ad­vi­sory.</p>
    <p>The Nas­daq, for ex­am­ple, on Tues­day closed below its 50-day mov­ing av­er­age for the first time since April, but was back above it on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“If you see these mar­kets j ust slice through sup­port lev­els, that’s a sign that the sellers have the up­per hand,” Mr Lerner said.</p>
