    <p>Last week, at a break­fast with the for­mer pres­i­dent of one of Ja­pan’s big­gest com­pa­nies, the now oblig­a­tory will-they-won’t-they Tokyo 2020 Olympics de­bate be­gan be­fore ei­ther of us had taken off our coats.</p>
    <p>De­spite his con­nec­tions, his for­mer com­pany be­ing a spon­sor and his own pas­sion for sport, he still couldn’t say for sure whether the Games would hap­pen.</p>
    <p>Best to think of them, he said, as Schrodinge­r’s Olympics. As with the Aus­trian physi­cist’s hy­po­thet­i­cal cat, the Olympics are both dead and alive in a box that no­body wants to open.</p>
    <p>Like so much else, Tokyo’s Olympic and Par­a­lympic Games owe their un­know­able state to Covid-19, the cri­sis that forced their post­pone­ment this year.</p>
    <p>The US Olympic Com­mit­tee has just de­clared it would not sanc­tion ath­letes who make peace­ful protest, such as by tak­ing a knee, with­out it be­ing clear if Ja­pan will al­low fully the live au­di­ences that might see them do so.</p>
    <p>The Games will likely take place in some form. But while there have been res­o­lute words from Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga and the Tokyo or­gan­is­ers, in­spec­tions by Olympic VIPs from Lausanne, new es­ti­mates of the reschedul­ing costs, and even a leaked plan to thin crowds at the open­ing torch re­lay, there is still no of­fi­cial con­fir­ma­tion that the Games will go ahead.</p>
    <p>Nor, though, is there any con­fir­ma­tion that they will not. Declar­ing them def­i­nitely hap­pen­ing raises lo­gis­ti­cal and epi­demi­o­log­i­cal ques­tions that seem im­pos­si­ble to sub­mit to scep­ti­cal pub­lic scru­tiny, even with a work­ing vac­cine. Tokyo also knows that can­celling them now, par­tic­u­larly with Bei­jing itch­ing to show it can host the 2022 Win­ter Games, would re­ver­ber­ate be­yond sport. It would be a global state­ment of de­spair with Ja­pan’s flag on top.</p>
    <p>The go/no-go Tokyo Olympics ques­tion – which ranges from how much Ja­panese im­mi­gra­tion should open to vis­i­tors, to whether cheer­ing can be al­lowed at out­door events – now vies with the weather as a con­ver­sa­tional stan­dard.</p>
    <p>Many of my friends and I, who hold tick­ets to Schrodinge­r’s Olympics, be­gan the year puffed with ex­cite­ment and we can still imag­ine some of that spirit be­ing re­cap­tured, how­ever con­strained the events may be.</p>
    <p>Even so, these Olympics al­ways played neg­a­tively in lo­cal opin­ion polls and there is doubt over their real value. The Ja­panese pub­lic’s gen­er­ally ner­vous be­hav­iour around Covid-19, said my break­fast com­pan­ion, sug­gests it is not about to be­come re­laxed about throw­ing open its doors in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>The de­lay has also honed com­plaints nor­mally blunted by the Games’ no­madic cy­cle. A big dol­lop of pre-Games hype is fine, but no Olympics is flat­tered by an ex­tra year of scru­tiny.</p>
    <p>The de­lay has in­ten­si­fied the bite of two is­sues. The most ob­vi­ous is the fi­nan­cial bur­den borne by the pub­lic purse.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore the ad­di­tional US$2.8 bil­lion (S$3.7 bil­lion) ex­pense of restag­ing the Games, the whole thing was of­fi­cially go­ing to cost US$12.6 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>But the real cost, ac­cord­ing to an es­ti­mate by the Ja­panese govern­ment’s own au­di­tors, would likely be twice that, mak­ing these the most ex­pen­sive</p>
    <p>Sum­mer Olympics ever staged.</p>
    <p>If you in­clude the reschedul­ing costs, the to­tal bill could reach US$30 bil­lion – roughly the same as Es­to­nia’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct and a fig­ure used by de­trac­tors to put price tags on each shot putted or javelin hurled.</p>
    <p>The other dif­fi­cult is­sue re­volves around how Tokyo orig­i­nally se­cured the right to host the Olympics and whether cer­tain pay­ments and ex­penses fell within In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee rules.</p>
    <p>Such ques­tions are part of a broader in­ves­ti­ga­tion by French prose­cu­tors into graft around this Games’ bid­ding process. Un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion is Mr Tsunekazu Takeda, the for­mer pres­i­dent of the Ja­pan Olympic Com­mit­tee, who de­nies wrong­do­ing but abruptly re­signed last year ahead of what should have been his great­est tri­umph.</p>
    <p>Usu­ally, the fi­nan­cial bur­den and darker side of the Olympics are dis­guised by the eupho­ria that comes with the suc­cess of any grand-scale na­tional project and the im­me­di­acy with which the fo­cus shifts to what­ever city hosts the Games next.</p>
    <p>For Tokyo, the de­lay has added an ex­tra year of scep­ti­cism, and di­min­ish­ing con­cern for the health of the cat in the box.</p>
