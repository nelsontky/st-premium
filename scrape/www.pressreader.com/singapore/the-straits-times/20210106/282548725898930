    <p>LON­DON Vanessa Kirby has never given birth, but af­ter shoot­ing her first lead movie role in Pieces Of A Woman, she kind of feels like she has. “When­ever I see a preg­nant woman now or some­one’s telling me she has just given birth, I smile,” she said in a re­cent video chat. “I feel with them.”</p>
    <p>The two full days she spent shoot­ing a sear­ing scene for the film could ex­plain this psy­chic confusion, as could the thor­ough way Kirby, 32, im­mersed her­self in the role.</p>
    <p>In Pieces Of A Woman, which de­buts to­mor­row on Net­flix, Kirby plays Martha, a preg­nant woman whose home birth goes hor­ri­bly wrong. This piv­otal event at the be­gin­ning of the film plays out in a 24-minute, sin­gle-take scene that starts with Martha’s first con­trac­tions and ends in tragedy.</p>
    <p>The cam­era fol­lows Martha, her part­ner Sean (Shia LaBeouf) and a mid­wife, Eva (Molly Parker), around the cou­ple’s apart­ment, con­dens­ing the ag­o­nies of labour into un­der half an hour.</p>
    <p>Last Septem­ber, the film pre­miered at the Venice Film Fes­ti­val, where Kirby won the Best Ac­tress award and be­gan to be talked about as an Os­car con­tender.</p>
    <p>She talked to women who had given birth and women who had had mis­car­riages, as well as mid­wives and ob­ste­tri­cian-gy­nae­col­o­gists at a Lon­don hos­pi­tal. While she was there, a woman ar­rived hav­ing con­trac­tions and agreed to let the ac­tress ob­serve the birth.</p>
    <p>The ex­pe­ri­ence of watch­ing that six-hour labour “changed me so pro­foundly”, Kirby said.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery sec­ond of what was hap­pen­ing to her, I just ab­sorbed.”</p>
    <p>And she be­gan to un­der­stand how to play Martha. The woman in the hos­pi­tal went into a primal, an­i­mal-like state, Kirby said. “Her body was tak­ing over and do­ing it, so that helped me so much for the scene,” she added.</p>
    <p>Over two days, that long take was shot six times. In a tele­phone in­ter­view, the di­rec­tor, Kor­nel Mun­druczo, who also works in theatre and opera, said that pre­par­ing it was like get­ting a stunt scene ready: “Lots of plan­ning, but you don’t know what’s go­ing to hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>In­spired by the labour she had ob­served, Kirby tried to think as lit­tle as pos­si­ble, she said, and not judge what her body was do­ing in the scene. Af­ter a decade of work, Pieces Of A Woman is her first time lead­ing a fea­ture film and it is a bold and mem­o­rable role that shows her flex­ing her act­ing mus­cles.</p>
    <p>Af­ter grad­u­at­ing from col­lege, where she stud­ied English lit­er­a­ture, Kirby was ac­cepted to the Lon­don Academy of Mu­sic and Dra­matic Art in 2009. A few months be­fore term be­gan, though, she was of­fered three stage roles by David Thacker, a for­mer di­rec­tor-in-res­i­dence at the Royal Shake­speare Com­pany, who was then the artis­tic di­rec­tor of the Oc­tagon Theatre in Bolton, a town in northern Eng­land.</p>
    <p>Kirby de­scribes that sea­son as her train­ing. “I learnt ev­ery­thing there,” she said. Work­ing with Thacker taught her to trust her­self, to find her way as an ac­tor, rather than wait­ing for other peo­ple to tell her what to do, she said.</p>
    <p>Kirby has been work­ing steadily ever since, with lead roles in the</p>
    <p>Ev­ery sec­ond of what was hap­pen­ing to her, I just ab­sorbed.</p>
    <p>Her body was tak­ing over and do­ing it, so that helped me so much for the scene.</p>
    <p>AC­TRESS VANESSA KIRBY (left), on ob­serv­ing a woman giv­ing birth in prepa­ra­tion for her role as a woman whose home birth goes wrong in Pieces Of A Woman</p>
    <p>West End, as well as high-pro­file sup­port­ing roles in films and Bri­tish tele­vi­sion cos­tume dra­mas.</p>
    <p>She starred as Princess Mar­garet in the first two sea­sons of The Crown, a per­for­mance that earned her a Bri­tish Academy of Film and Tele­vi­sion Arts award. In 2018’s Mis­sion: Im­pos­si­ble – Fall­out, she played the White Widow, a glam­orous black-mar­ket bro­ker who car­ries a knife in her garter and knows how to use it.</p>
    <p>It is fit­ting, given Kirby’s the­atri­cal back­ground, that Pieces Of A Woman started life as a play, writ­ten by Kata We­ber, Mun­druczo’s part­ner, who drew on the cou­ple’s own ex­pe­ri­ence of los­ing a child.</p>
    <p>Mun­druczo, 45, said he hopes watch­ing Martha’s ex­pe­ri­ences will en­cour­age “peo­ple to be brave enough to have their own answer for any loss”.</p>
    <p>In re­cent months, model Chrissy Teigen and Meghan Markle, the</p>
    <p>Duchess of Sus­sex, have shared their ex­pe­ri­ences with preg­nancy loss.</p>
    <p>Kirby said that, while re­search­ing for the role be­fore film­ing, she found that women who had ex­pe­ri­enced one were “re­ally re­lieved to talk about it” and ap­pre­ci­ated that some­one wanted to un­der­stand.</p>
    <p>Her next project will see her co-star­ring as Tal­lie, one of two farm­ers’ wives who fall in love in the United States in the 19th cen­tury in The World To Come, a med­i­ta­tive drama from Nor­we­gian film-maker Mona Fastvold.</p>
    <p>And af­ter that?</p>
    <p>Kirby said she was read­ing scripts, on the hunt for the next role that will scare her.</p>
    <p>She is look­ing for an “un­told story about women”, she said, that will feel as ur­gent to tell as Martha and Tal­lie’s did.</p>
    <p>“What’s that ex­pres­sion?” she said. “Feel the fear and do it any­way.”</p>
