    <p>WEL­COM­ING BABY N0. 2: Tai­wanese ac­tor Mike He (above) made a sur­prise an­nounce­ment on Tues­day on so­cial me­dia about the ar­rival of his sec­ond child.</p>
    <p>The 36-year-old star, who had kept his wife’s preg­nancy un­der wraps, posted pho­tos of his three-year-old daugh­ter hold­ing her new baby sis­ter.</p>
    <p>He wrote: “Daddy’s sec­ond lover from a pre­vi­ous life. Wel­come to the world, daddy’s sec­ond princess.”</p>
    <p>As the oc­ca­sion co­in­cided with Chi­nese Valen­tine’s Day, he wished his fans Happy Valen­tine’s Day and thanked the hospi­tal staff at Dianthus MFM</p>
    <p>Clinic for tak­ing good care of his wife and child.</p>
    <p>Not much is known about He’s wife. He shocked the Tai­wanese en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try when he an­nounced in 2017 that he was mar­ried, with a then four-month-old elder daugh­ter born in the United States.</p>
    <p>His wife’s iden­tity is not known as she is not in the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try. He has kept a tight lid on news and pho­tos of her.</p>
    <p>He, who be­came fa­mous in the early 2000s from Tai­wanese idol dra­mas such as Love Con­tract (2004) and Devil Be­side You (2005), has been fo­cused on fur­ther­ing his ca­reer in China in re­cent years.</p>
