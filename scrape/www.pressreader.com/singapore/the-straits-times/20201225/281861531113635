    <p>• If the roll-out of Covid-19 vac­cines pro­ceeds smoothly, it might be pos­si­ble to achieve wide­spread pop­u­la­tion im­mu­nity in the United States by next sum­mer, top sci­en­tist An­thony Fauci has said.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with We­bMD that was posted on Wed­nes­day, the in­fec­tious dis­ease of­fi­cial sug­gested peo­ple could host wed­dings as early as June or July.</p>
    <p>Dr Fauci said he be­lieved pri­or­ity seg­ments – such as nurs­ing home res­i­dents, health­care work­ers, crit­i­cal work­ers, the el­derly and peo­ple at high risk – should re­ceive their shots by March or early April.</p>
    <p>“We could start in April do­ing what I call ‘open sea­son’ on vac­ci­na­tions – namely any­body in the gen­eral pop­u­la­tion who wants to get vac­ci­nated will get vac­ci­nated.”</p>
    <p>He con­tin­ued: “By the time we get into the mid­dle or end of the sum­mer, I be­lieve we will have, if we do it cor­rectly, we could have 70 to 85 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>“When that oc­curs, there will be an um­brella of pro­tec­tion over the en­tire coun­try.”</p>
    <p>The US is try­ing to ob­tain sam­ples of the mu­tant strain of SarsCoV-2 in Bri­tain for test­ing at the Na­tional In­sti­tutes of Health, Dr Fauci said in a taped in­ter­view that will air on Bloomberg Tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>“We need to take this se­ri­ously and we need to in­ves­ti­gate it much fur­ther.” While it has not yet been de­tected in the US, the UK vari­ant may al­ready be in the coun­try, Dr Fauci said. When viruses like Sars-CoV-2 repli­cate “rapidly and ex­ten­sively, you will get mu­tants”, he added.</p>
    <p>As part of an ef­fort to in­crease con­fi­dence, Dr Fauci re­ceived the coro­n­avirus vac­cine on Tues­day. He said he ex­pe­ri­enced some aches and sore­ness, but felt fine.</p>
