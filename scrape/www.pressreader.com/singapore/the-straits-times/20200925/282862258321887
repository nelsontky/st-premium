    <p>NEW YORK • Amer­i­can su­per­model Gigi Ha­did gave birth to a baby girl over the week­end.</p>
    <p>The news was bro­ken by her boyfriend, former One Di­rec­tion singer Zayn Ma­lik, on Twit­ter yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old wrote: “Our baby girl is here, healthy & beau­ti­ful.</p>
    <p>“To try put into words how I am feel­ing right now would be an im­pos­si­ble task. The love I feel for this tiny hu­man is be­yond my un­der­stand­ing.</p>
    <p>“Grate­ful to know her, proud to call her mine, & thank­ful for the life we will have to­gether.”</p>
    <p>Ma­lik’s post was ac­com­pa­nied with a photo of him hold­ing his baby’s hand.</p>
    <p>Ha­did, 25, also con­firmed the news on so­cial me­dia later in the day, writ­ing: “Our girl joined us earth­side this week­end and she’s al­ready changed our world. So in love”.</p>
    <p>She also posted a photo of her daugh­ter’s hand hold­ing Ma­lik’s (above).</p>
    <p>Ha­did con­firmed her preg­nancy in late April in an ap­pear­ance on The Tonight Show with talk-show host Jimmy Fal­lon.</p>
    <p>She and Ma­lik have been in an onoff re­la­tion­ship since 2015.</p>
    <p>Ma­lik is the third mem­ber of One Di­rec­tion to be­come a fa­ther. Louis Tom­lin­son has a four-year-old son with stylist Bri­ana Jung­wirth, while Liam Payne has a three-year-old son with singer Ch­eryl.</p>
