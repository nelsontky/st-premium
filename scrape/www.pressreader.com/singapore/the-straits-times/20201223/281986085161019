    <p>The Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment ear­lier this month pub­lished a land­mark study on the long-term ef­fects of di­vorce on chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with peers whose par­ents re­mained mar­ried, these chil­dren were less likely to have grad­u­ated from univer­sity, earned less and had lower Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund bal­ances at age 35. They were also more likely to be un­mar­ried or di­vorced.</p>
    <p>How­ever, to make sense of what is called the “di­vorce penalty”, one should go be­yond com­par­ing out­comes of chil­dren of di­vorce with those from in­tact fam­i­lies. There is a need to iden­tify what it is about di­vorce that con­trib­utes to these neg­a­tive de­vel­op­men­tal out­comes and why some chil­dren are more vul­ner­a­ble than oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Di­vorce may not be a risk fac­tor, but sim­ply a marker of prob­lem­atic fam­ily dy­nam­ics. Chil­dren of di­vorced par­ents may al­ready be at risk long be­fore di­vorce oc­curs.</p>
    <p>Also, while some chil­dren strug­gle with the bur­den of their par­ents’ di­vorce years af­ter it hap­pens, many chil­dren of di­vorced par­ents are as well ad­justed as their peers with mar­ried par­ents.</p>
    <p>Hence, in­stead of fo­cus­ing on di­vorce, pub­lic pol­icy so­lu­tions should tar­get strength­en­ing re­la­tion­ships, en­cour­ag­ing ef­fec­tive parenting and pro­mot­ing men­tal health.</p>
    <p>There are three key fac­tors that can ex­plain poor out­comes in chil­dren’s devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>MAR­I­TAL CON­FLICT</p>
    <p>A study of 618 fam­i­lies that were part of the United States Na­tional Sur­vey of Fam­i­lies and House­holds found that high mar­i­tal con­flict was re­lated to more child be­havioural prob­lems, but that mar­i­tal sta­tus it­self was not sig­nif­i­cantly re­lated to these out­comes.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, so­ci­ol­o­gists Paul Amato and Alan Booth stud­ied Amer­i­can fam­i­lies over a 12-year pe­riod and found that chil­dren whose par­ents di­vorce may have bet­ter long-term ad­just­ment than do chil­dren whose par­ents re­main in high-con­flict mar­riages, if di­vorce re­duces the child’s ex­po­sure to the con­flict.</p>
    <p>In other words, it is not di­vorce per se, but ex­po­sure to mar­i­tal con­flict in cou­ples who even­tu­ally di­vorce that may be the de­ter­min­ing fac­tor for their devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>So the link with di­vorce is that chil­dren of di­vorced par­ents tend to be at greater risk for prob­lem­atic de­vel­op­men­tal out­comes – such as aca­demic, re­la­tion­ship and men­tal health prob­lems – be­cause they are of­ten ex­posed to par­ents in con­flict.</p>
    <p>This risk is real for many chil­dren of di­vorced par­ents in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>A pro­file anal­y­sis com­pleted by the Sin­ga­pore Sub­or­di­nate Courts in 2003 found that com­mu­ni­ca­tion break­down, phys­i­cal vi­o­lence, con­stant quar­relling and prob­lems with in-laws were the top rea­sons for di­vorce. Over 40 per cent of these cou­ples had chil­dren be­low the age of seven.</p>
    <p>MEN­TAL HEALTH AND PARENTING IS­SUES</p>
    <p>When there is mar­i­tal con­flict and changes in the fam­ily struc­ture, par­ents ex­pe­ri­ence in­creased stress and men­tal health prob­lems, which can im­pact their abil­ity to look af­ter their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>In­deed, Dr Amato and Dr Booth found that many par­ents who even­tu­ally di­vorced had prob­lems with parenting as early as eight to 12 years be­fore the di­vorce.</p>
    <p>Of course, di­vorce can also dis­rupt parenting by mak­ing it more dif­fi­cult for par­ents to ef­fec­tively mon­i­tor and su­per­vise their chil­dren, dis­ci­pline them con­sis­tently and pro­vide am­ple warmth and af­fec­tion, par­tic­u­larly if both par­ents are not on the same page.</p>
    <p>ECO­NOMIC IN­STA­BIL­ITY</p>
    <p>Af­ter a di­vorce, chil­dren may have to move homes or neigh­bour­hoods and ad­just to new liv­ing sit­u­a­tions, all of which can im­pact their well-be­ing. For many fam­i­lies, the day-to-day care of the child usu­ally falls on sin­gle moth­ers who do not have ac­cess to the same fi­nan­cial re­sources as they did prior to di­vorce; and this fi­nan­cial in­sta­bil­ity may be ex­ac­er­bated if reg­u­lar child sup­port is not forth­com­ing.</p>
    <p>There­fore, ad­dress­ing what hap­pens in the fam­ily lead­ing up to and fol­low­ing di­vorce may be more ef­fec­tive in im­prov­ing chil­dren’s out­comes than ad­dress­ing di­vorce it­self.</p>
    <p>Here are some things that can be done.</p>
    <p>OF­FER SUP­PORT AT THE RIGHT TIME</p>
    <p>More can be done to in­cen­tivise cou­ples to de­velop stronger con­flict res­o­lu­tion skills at key tran­si­tion points in their re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>Pro­vid­ing free mar­riage prepa­ra­tion cour­ses to all cou­ples who reg­is­ter for mar­riage, with reg­u­lar fol­low-up in the early years of the mar­riage, could help cre­ate strong mar­i­tal foun­da­tions. The pos­i­tive re­sult of the Ber­samamu (Malay for With You) pro­gramme, which fol­lows this ap­proach for the Malay/Mus­lim cou­ples, is ev­i­dence of this.</p>
    <p>Screen­ing cou­ples for re­la­tion­ship stress dur­ing reg­u­lar an­te­na­tal check-ups, par­tic­u­larly be­fore the birth of their first child, and pro­vid­ing them with re­fer­rals to sub­sidised re­la­tion­ship skills-build­ing cour­ses could also help.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cially in­cen­tivis­ing cou­ples who choose to en­rol in such cour­ses could help in­crease the up­take.</p>
    <p>For fam­i­lies who need more in­ten­sive help, fund­ing is an is­sue.</p>
    <p>While health in­sur­ance now cov­ers di­ag­nos­able men­tal health prob­lems, re­bates could be pro­vided for pub­lic or pri­vate pre­ven­ta­tive care that tar­gets stress, parenting and re­la­tion­ship prob­lems be­fore they be­come se­ri­ous clin­i­cal is­sues.</p>
    <p>TRAN­SI­TIONAL</p>
    <p>FI­NAN­CIAL SUP­PORT TO NEWLY DI­VORCED FAM­I­LIES</p>
    <p>Re­cent re­lax­ation in Hous­ing Board rules has made for smoother hous­ing tran­si­tions post-di­vorce. How­ever, more can be done to help newly sin­gle par­ents.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously un­em­ployed moth­ers may have trou­ble find­ing a job that ac­com­mo­dates the flex­i­bil­ity that a sin­gle par­ent needs. Some may have prob­lems as­sess­ing their chang­ing fi­nan­cial needs and re­sources.</p>
    <p>Ad­e­quate em­ploy­ment sup­port, tran­si­tional grants and fi­nan­cial plan­ning ser­vices, par­tic­u­larly for those out­side the typ­i­cal pa­ram­e­ters of “low-in­come and needy”, are key to en­sur­ing that chil­dren of these di­vorced fam­i­lies are not pe­nalised twice over.</p>
    <p>The “di­vorce penalty” is of­ten framed as a ques­tion of whether par­ents in dif­fi­cult re­la­tion­ships should stay to­gether for the sake of their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>The real ques­tion we should be ask­ing is what we can do to op­ti­mise out­comes for chil­dren, given the re­al­ity that re­la­tion­ships are chal­leng­ing.</p>
    <p>If chil­dren’s needs are truly a pri­or­ity, then the fo­cus should not only be on pre­serv­ing mar­riage, but rather, on strength­en­ing fam­i­lies by pro­mot­ing well-be­ing and good re­la­tion­ships.</p>
