    <p>MADRID • New Va­len­cia man­ager Javi Gra­cia re­vealed his in­tent to turn the La Liga out­fit into a “brave, ag­gres­sive and bal­anced side” af­ter sign­ing a two-year deal on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The 50-year-old is Va­len­cia’s third full-time man­ager since the start of the re­cently-con­cluded La Liga cam­paign, af­ter the sack­ings of Marcelino last Septem­ber and Al­bert Ce­lades last month.</p>
    <p>Gra­cia has been out of a job since be­ing sacked by Wat­ford in Septem­ber af­ter a poor start to the Premier</p>
    <p>League – just four months af­ter tak­ing the Hor­nets to only their sec­ond FA Cup fi­nal, where they lost 6-0 to Manch­ester City.</p>
    <p>His list of for­mer teams also in­cludes Rus­sian out­fit Ru­bin Kazan and Span­ish sides Malaga, Osasuna and Alme­ria.</p>
    <p>“I would like the team’s style of play to speak for it­self and show what we want to be,” Gra­cia told the club’s web­site. “I’d like this great squad that we have be a brave, ag­gres­sive and bal­anced side.</p>
    <p>“We all like to talk about at­tack­ing foot­ball but the suc­cess of a team comes through its bal­ance and we will try to do that with the great squad and ex­cel­lent play­ers that we have.</p>
    <p>“I think the tal­ent that ex­ists within the squad is vi­tal.”</p>
    <p>Yet he could soon lose one of his best play­ers as Span­ish winger Fer­ran Tor­res, who has just one year left on his con­tract, has re­port­edly re­jected nu­mer­ous of­fers to stay at the Mestalla.</p>
    <p>The 20-year-old has been heav­ily linked with a move to Manch­ester City, with GoalEs­pana claim­ing the two clubs have agreed a fee, be­lieved to be between €30 mil­lion (S$48.5 mil­lion) and €40 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Va­len­cia, owned by Sin­ga­porean bil­lion­aire Peter Lim, fin­ished ninth in La Liga this sea­son on 53 points, miss­ing out on qual­i­fi­ca­tion for Europe. They were knocked out of the Cham­pi­ons League in the last 16 by Ital­ian club Ata­lanta.</p>
