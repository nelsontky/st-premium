    <p>I am walk­ing a her­itage trail fea­tur­ing fa­mous women in Sin­ga­pore, but the sis­ter­hood seems to be elud­ing me.</p>
    <p>My guide, Ms May Hui, 66, is tak­ing me on Walk­ing In The Foot­steps Of Our Fore­moth­ers, a walk­ing tour fea­tur­ing 20 women and the land­marks they are as­so­ci­ated with.</p>
    <p>It is or­gan­ised by the Sin­ga­pore Coun­cil of Women’s Or­gan­i­sa­tions (SCWO) and the Sin­ga­pore Women’s Hall of Fame. The hall was cre­ated by SCWO to honour women of his­toric sig­nif­i­cance in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>We start at the SCWO build­ing in Water­loo Street and head to Ob­jec­tifs: Cen­tre for Pho­tog­ra­phy and Film, a strik­ing yel­low build­ing a few strides away.</p>
    <p>In 1887, Aus­tralian mis­sion­ary Sophia Black­more came to Sin­ga­pore, where she lived for about 40 years, help­ing to found schools such as Methodist Girls’ School. She went to the church that stood where Ob­jec­tifs is.</p>
    <p>The walk also cov­ers ar­eas near the Na­tional Mu­seum of Sin­ga­pore and roads such as Hill Street and Stam­ford Road.</p>
    <p>In war hero El­iz­a­beth Choy’s case, for in­stance, Ms Hui re­lates how she and her hus­band were tor­tured by the Kem­peitai, the Ja­panese mil­i­tary po­lice, at the YMCA build­ing, though they never be­trayed the pris­on­ers of war they aided.</p>
    <p>While th­ese sto­ries of strength and grit still res­onate, the build­ings once as­so­ci­ated with th­ese women have only ten­u­ous links with them. There is a poignant hol­low­ness.</p>
    <p>Yet, a per­sonal con­nec­tion with re­cent his­tory makes all the dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Ms Hui takes me to the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (Nafa) cam­pus in Ben­coolen Street.</p>
    <p>Visu­ally dis­abled artist and Cul­tural Medal­lion re­cip­i­ent Chng Seok Tin used to study at Nafa. Even though she lost most of her eye­sight in 1988, af­ter a surgery to re­move a brain ab­scess, she con­tin­ued to work in art forms like mixed me­dia and sculp­ture.</p>
    <p>Ms Hui, who knew Ms Chng, re­calls how she took the artist to the beach as re­quested, some time be­fore she died of can­cer last year at the age of 73.</p>
    <p>Ms Chng had wanted to hear the sound of the sea – a de­tail that Ms Hui im­parts, which makes me want to find out more about the artist.</p>
    <p>Ms Hui is also skilled at evok­ing scenes from the past, us­ing old pho­tos as props, such as ones of the dho­bis or In­dian wash­er­men who used to wash laun­dry in a stream near the Na­tional Mu­seum.</p>
    <p>The tomb­stone for Agnes Joaquim, who bred Sin­ga­pore’s first orchid hy­brid and na­tional flower Vanda Miss Joaquim and died in 1899, still stands at the beau­ti­ful Ar­me­nian Church. Con­se­crated in 1836, it is Sin­ga­pore’s old­est Chris­tian church.</p>
    <p>By the end of the walk, de­spite lim­i­ta­tions such as a lack of arte­facts on a walk­ing trail, my ad­mi­ra­tion of this his­tor­i­cal soror­ity of women trail­blaz­ers burns brighter.</p>
