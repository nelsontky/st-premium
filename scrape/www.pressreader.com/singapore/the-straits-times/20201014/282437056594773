    <p>What are the ben­e­fits of these early 5G net­works?</p>
    <p>The 5G net­works by M1, Sing­tel and StarHub for their con­sumer tri­als are built on top of their ex­ist­ing 4G net­works and are known as non-stand­alone (NSA) 5G net­works.</p>
    <p>NSA 5G net­works will trig­ger faster mo­bile speeds on 5G-en­abled de­vices. How­ever, the full suite of 5G ben­e­fits, such as ul­tra-low la­tency and in­creased net­work ca­pac­ity, will be de­liv­ered only by stand­alone (SA) 5G net­works that will be de­ployed from next year and are ex­pected to cover the en­tire is­land by 2025.</p>
    <p>How much does the 5G ser­vice cost?</p>
    <p>M1 of­fers a 5G booster add-on for ex­ist­ing cus­tomers that starts at $15 a month and comes with 25GB of lo­cal data on top of its cur­rent data quota.</p>
    <p>New and re­con­tract­ing cus­tomers can en­joy the 5G booster at a dis­counted price, start­ing at $5 a month.</p>
    <p>Sing­tel’s free 5G trial for the first 20,000 cus­tomers has been fully re­deemed. But new or ex­ist­ing cus­tomers with a 5G-en­abled hand­set can pay $10 a month to ac­cess the ser­vice, which comes with 10GB of lo­cal data and is con­tract-free.</p>
    <p>StarHub’s 5G ser­vice is avail­able to any new or re­con­tract­ing cus­tomer who takes up its Mo­bile+ or Biz+ plans. The Mo­bile+ plans start at $65 a month with a two-year con­tract, while the Biz+ plans start at $54 a month with a two-year plan.</p>
    <p>Where can I use the 5G ser­vice?</p>
    <p>M1 :</p>
    <p>• Cen­tral and down­town ar­eas in­clud­ing the Cen­tral Busi­ness Dis­trict (CBD), Or­chard Road, Sun­tec City and Ma­rina Bay.</p>
    <p>• West, in­clud­ing the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore and Dover.</p>
    <p>• Key town cen­tres by the end of the year. Sing­tel:</p>
    <p>• CBD and down­town ar­eas, in­clud­ing Or­chard, Som­er­set, Tan­jong Pa­gar and Har­bourfront. The full list is avail­able on the Sing­tel web­site,</p>
    <p>• Kal­lang, MacPher­son and Lit­tle In­dia are among sev­eral lo­ca­tions to be added by March next year.</p>
    <p>StarHub:</p>
    <p>• StarHub says it has about 70 per cent na­tional cov­er­age with 5G ac­cess in key town cen­tres in the the North,</p>
    <p>East and West. The full list is avail­able on its web­site.</p>
    <p>How do I know if I am con­nected to the 5G net­work?</p>
    <p>If 5G is avail­able, your 5G-en­abled de­vice should au­to­mat­i­cally con­nect to the net­work and a 5G icon will be dis­played at the top of the screen.</p>
    <p>If there is no 5G cov­er­age, the de­vice should switch seam­lessly to the 4G net­work.</p>
    <p>If this does not hap­pen, check your phone set­tings by go­ing to net­work mode (un­der mo­bile net­works). Check if 5G or NR (New Ra­dio) is se­lected, de­pend­ing on your phone model.</p>
    <p>Do I need a new smart­phone to use the 5G net­work?</p>
    <p>You will need a 5G-en­abled smart­phone that sup­ports</p>
    <p>NSA 5G net­works.</p>
    <p>If you bought a 5G-en­abled smart­phone be­fore the lo­cal 5G roll-out, your de­vice will likely re­quire a soft­ware up­date from the man­u­fac­turer.</p>
    <p>New and up­com­ing 5G smart­phones such as the re­cently launched Sam­sung Gal­axy S20 FE 5G will sup­port 5G out of the box.</p>
    <p>Check the list of 5G-en­abled de­vices for your telco on its web­site.</p>
