    <p>HOUSTON • Car­los Or­tiz cap­tured his first PGA Tour ti­tle on Sun­day, fir­ing five birdies in a five-un­der 65 for a two-shot Houston Open win over top-ranked Dustin Johnson and Hideki Mat­suyama.</p>
    <p>The Mex­i­can padded his mar­gin with a fi­nal-hole flour­ish of a birdie at Me­mo­rial Park Golf Course, with Houston host­ing a PGA event for the first time since 1963. “It was awe­some fin­ish­ing with this birdie putt on 18,” said Or­tiz, who rolled in a 22-footer at the last for a 13-un­der to­tal of 267.</p>
    <p>The world No. 65 played col­lege golf at North Texas Univer­sity in Dal­las, and has a home in Texas.</p>
    <p>“This is like my sec­ond home,” Or­tiz, the first Mex­ico-born player to win a PGA Tour event since Vic­tor Re­gal­ado in the 1970s, said. “There was a bunch of peo­ple cheer­ing for me, Lati­nos and Tex­ans. I’m thank­ful for all of them.”</p>
    <p>The tour­na­ment was the first to al­low fans since the PGA Tour re­sumed in June fol­low­ing a three­month coro­n­avirus-en­forced hia­tus. A to­tal of 2,000 spec­ta­tors were al­lowed each day, with mask re­quire­ments and so­cial dis­tanc­ing pre­cau­tions in place.</p>
    <p>While the vic­tory gives Or­tiz a spot in next year’s Masters, the 29-year-old will not be part of the field at the year’s fi­nal Ma­jor start­ing on Thurs­day at Au­gusta.</p>
    <p>The week pro­vided an en­cour­ag­ing tune-up for the Masters for Johnson, Mat­suyama and oth­ers, in­clud­ing four-time Ma­jor win­ner Brooks Koepka, who carded a 65 to fin­ish joint-fifth on 272.</p>
    <p>Reign­ing PGA Tour Player of the Year and FedExCup win­ner Johnson missed two planned starts last month af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus but has since re­cov­ered. He had six birdies and a bo­gey in his 65 for a to­tal of 269.</p>
    <p>He was joined by Mat­suyama, who had seven birdies with­out a bo­gey in his 63, although the Ja­panese re­mains with­out a vic­tory since 2017. How­ever, the world No. 18 said his Houston show­ing was a good sign ahead of Au­gusta.</p>
    <p>“My good fin­ish over the week­end is go­ing to re­ally hope­fully help me in the Masters this week com­ing up,” the 28 year-old said.</p>
    <p>Au­gusta National an­nounced yes­ter­day the Masters field will be trimmed to only the low 50 and level af­ter 36 holes. Pre­vi­ously, any­one in the top 50 and ties and within 10 strokes of the lead made the cut.</p>
