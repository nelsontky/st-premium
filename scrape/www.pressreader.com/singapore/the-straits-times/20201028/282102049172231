    <p>From to­day, the new Work­ers’ Party-run Sengkang Town Coun­cil (SKTC) will take over the full man­age­ment and main­te­nance of ar­eas pre­vi­ously in other con­stituen­cies, but which came un­der the newly formed Sengkang GRC in the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The change was an­nounced by the Pasir Ris-Pung­gol and Ang Mo Kio town coun­cils, both run by the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP), in sep­a­rate state­ments yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Pasir Ris-Pung­gol Town Coun­cil also said it handed over its two of­fice premises in Sengkang GRC to SKTC yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>They are at Block 266 Com­pass­vale Bow and Block 156A River­vale Cres­cent.</p>
    <p>Sengkang GRC, with more than 120,000 vot­ers, is partly made up of the for­mer Pung­gol East SMC and the Sengkang Cen­tral di­vi­sion of Pasir Ris-Pung­gol GRC, both of which were man­aged by the Pasir Ris-Pung­gol Town Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>The group rep­re­sen­ta­tion con­stituency is also made up of parts of Sengkang West SMC, which was man­aged by Ang Mo Kio Town Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>Town coun­cils con­trol, man­age, main­tain and im­prove the com­mon ar­eas of the res­i­den­tial and com­mer­cial prop­er­ties in their towns for res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>In the July gen­eral elec­tion, the Work­ers’ Party (WP) team se­cured 52.12 per cent of the votes in Sengkang GRC.</p>
    <p>Its team, com­pris­ing lawyer He Ting Ru, econ­o­mist Ja­mus Lim, eq­uity re­search an­a­lyst Louis Chua and so­cial ac­tivist Raeesah Khan, beat the PAP team made up of labour chief Ng Chee Meng, then Se­nior Min­is­ter of State Lam Pin Min, then Se­nior Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary Am­rin Amin and lawyer Ray­mond Lye.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands the two PAP town coun­cils have handed over to SKTC the con­tracts of the man­ag­ing agents they had ap­pointed to carry out the day-to-day op­er­a­tions of the ar­eas that are now in Sengkang GRC.</p>
    <p>The PAP town coun­cils also said ar­range­ments have been made for res­i­dents who now pay their ser­vice and con­ser­vancy charges through Giro or other re­cur­ring pay­ment schemes to con­tinue do­ing so with­out dis­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>Un­der the law, town coun­cils have up to 90 days from their for­ma­tion to take over the man­age­ment of ar­eas that are trans­ferred to them.</p>
    <p>SKTC was among 17 town coun­cils that were formed on July 30, which means it has to take over the man­age­ment of the trans­ferred ar­eas from to­day.</p>
    <p>The es­tates that Pasir Ris-Pung­gol Town Coun­cil trans­ferred to SKTC com­prise blocks 201A to</p>
    <p>299C i n the Com­pass­vale area, blocks 101 to 197 in the River­vale area, and blocks 121C to 282C in Sengkang Cen­tral and Sengkang East.</p>
    <p>Ang Mo Kio Town Coun­cil trans­ferred blocks 301A to 356B in the An­chor­vale area and Sengkang East Way.</p>
    <p>Both town coun­cils wished SKTC the best in its ef­forts to serve Sengkang res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>In its state­ment, Pasir Ris-Pung</p>
    <p>gol Town Coun­cil also thanked Sengkang res­i­dents for their sup­port and said it hoped they will con­tinue to work with SKTC in car­ing for the peo­ple and the town.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, Ang Mo Kio Town Coun­cil said it was grate­ful for the op­por­tu­nity to serve res­i­dents in the for­mer Sengkang West SMC in the past few years.</p>
