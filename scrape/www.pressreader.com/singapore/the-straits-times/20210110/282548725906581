    <p>Singapore’s prop­erty mar­ket wit­nessed a roller-coaster ride over the past year. Home sales plunged to his­tor­i­cal lows dur­ing the April and May cir­cuit breaker pe­riod. But at the end of the move­ment re­stric­tions, prop­erty buy­ing ac­tiv­i­ties re­bounded strongly across many mar­ket seg­ments.</p>
    <p>Although the coron­avirus may con­tinue to cast a shadow over the broader econ­omy, global mar­kets have al­ready looked past cur­rent head­winds and are bank­ing hopes on the suc­cess of Covid-19 vac­cines. The pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated some prop­erty trends and spawned new ones that may present at­trac­tive in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties for buy­ers.</p>
    <p>We of­fer a pre­view of how the prop­erty mar­ket here may fare this year, and the key trends to keep an eye on. Singapore’s prop­erty out­look hinges mainly on the coun­try’s abil­ity – and global col­lec­tive ef­forts – to rein in Covid-19. The real es­tate mar­ket is poised for a steady re­cov­ery and fur­ther price growth if our econ­omy re­bounds strongly this year.</p>
    <p>1. Re­cov­ery to gather pace on fresh op­ti­mism</p>
    <p>Singapore’s hous­ing mar­ket is one of the sec­tors that are defying grav­ity. De­spite the pan­demic, we ob­served healthy sales for landed prop­er­ties and the pri­vate and Hous­ing Board mar­kets.</p>
    <p>We ex­pect hous­ing de­mand and buy­ing sen­ti­ment to pick up fur­ther in the com­ing months on grow­ing vac­cine op­ti­mism and po­ten­tial macroe­co­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>On a macro level, many economies could emerge stronger from the worst global re­ces­sion in liv­ing mem­ory, although some are ex­pected to bounce back faster than oth­ers this year. Many econ­o­mists have ob­served a K-shaped, bi­fur­cated re­cov­ery where some sec­tors are re­bound­ing more quickly than oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Un­der the K-shaped eco­nomic model, pro­fes­sional work­ers in high-growth in­dus­tries in­volv­ing tech­nol­ogy, health­care, fin­tech, lo­gis­tics and soft­ware have con­tin­ued to do well, whereas work­ers in hos­pi­tal­ity, re­tail and bricks-and-mor­tar busi­nesses are strug­gling for sur­vival.</p>
    <p>The real es­tate mar­ket has long been a play­ground for the af­flu­ent. The wealth ex­pan­sion of this group will bode well for the real es­tate mar­ket as they may con­tinue to grow their in­vest­ment port­fo­lios in tan­dem with their in­come.</p>
    <p>Many may di­vert their wealth to, or deepen their in­vest­ments in, some form of real es­tate prod­ucts, es­pe­cially res­i­den­tial prop­er­ties that could give more sta­ble re­turns in the long run.</p>
    <p>Mone­tary wealth has also grown for many ul­tra-high-net-worth in­di­vid­u­als. Ac­cord­ing to a 2020 UBS/PwC Bil­lion­aires In­sights re­port, the col­lec­tive for­tunes of bil­lion­aires soared by US$2 tril­lion (S$2.65 tril­lion) to US$10.2 tril­lion amid the Covid-19 cri­sis. Many bought su­per­lux­ury homes and high-end prop­er­ties, which may ex­plain why our lux­ury home seg­ment con­tin­ued to per­form well dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>2. Di­min­ish­ing home sup­ply may con­tinue to prop up prices</p>
    <p>The over­sup­ply risk in Singapore’s res­i­den­tial mar­ket may be eas­ing soon. The num­ber of new project launches slated for this year is ex­pected to be lower than in pre­vi­ous years.</p>
    <p>About 20 new de­vel­op­ments may be re­leased for sale in the first half of this year. In con­trast, the last col­lec­tive sale cy­cle notched a block­buster per­for­mance in 2018 and 2019, with around 25 to 30 res­i­den­tial projects launched in each of the half years.</p>
    <p>There will be fewer mega launches in the mass mar­ket and city fringe ar­eas. Most big projects have al­ready been launched dur­ing the past three years. More­over, land sales have de­clined dras­ti­cally in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>Col­lec­tive sale ac­tiv­i­ties came to an al­most com­plete halt af­ter the Govern­ment im­ple­mented new cool­ing mea­sures in July 2018.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment has also cal­i­brated land sup­ply from the Govern­ment Land Sales pro­gramme. Over the past two years, a con­ser­va­tive slate of land was re­leased to main­tain a mod­er­ate sup­ply of units. For the first half of this year, about 1,600 new homes could be launched from the con­firmed list, much fewer than the av­er­age of 2,700 units re­leased in each half of 2018.</p>
    <p>Many new projects re­de­vel­oped from the 2017 to 2018 spate of sales en bloc have al­ready sold more than 70 per cent of their units.</p>
    <p>With a healthy net ab­sorp­tion of new homes over the past three years, the higher take-up num­bers against a con­ser­va­tive sup­ply have re­sulted in fewer un­sold, un­com­pleted pri­vate homes. The cu­mu­la­tive num­ber of un­sold units may be near­ing its peak, and could start ta­per­ing this year.</p>
    <p>With di­min­ish­ing stock and the im­prove­ments in the macroe­co­nomic out­look, the prob­a­bil­ity of home prices falling this year is not high. As it is, prices of pri­vate homes in­creased quar­ter on quar­ter by 2.1 per cent in the fourth quar­ter of last year, based on the lat­est flash es­ti­mates from the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity, af­ter ris­ing 0.8 per cent in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter. Over­all pri­vate home prices rose 2.2 per cent for the whole of last year.</p>
    <p>3. Fi­nal tranche of new homes to be re­leased from lat­est col­lec­tive sale cy­cle</p>
    <p>There are sev­eral block­buster launches to watch this year. Th­ese projects are among the fi­nal tranche of pri­vate homes to be launched from the 2017 to 2018 col­lec­tive sale cy­cle.</p>
    <p>Large, free­hold prime sites are few and far be­tween. Buy­ers who aim to snag a slice of the lux­ury home pie may have to wait for the next col­lec­tive sale cy­cle – which usu­ally oc­curs ev­ery eight to 10 years – should they miss the buy­ing op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>Some highly an­tic­i­pated lux­ury home launches are Mid­town Mod­ern, Cairn­hill 16 (the for­mer Cairn­hill Heights), One Ber­nam, Park Nova (the for­mer Park House), Klimt Cairn­hill (the for­mer Cairn­hill Man­sions), Per­fect Ten (the for­mer City Tow­ers), the for­mer Liang Court, and Ir­well Hill Res­i­dences.</p>
    <p>Park Nova may be closely watched as the de­vel­op­ment is built from the for­mer Park House, which was sold en bloc for a record-smash­ing $2,910 per sq ft per plot ra­tio in 2018.</p>
    <p>With al­most 1,900 units, Nor­man­ton Park will per­haps be one of the high­est-pro­file new launches this year. The project is by far the most ex­ten­sive city fringe de­vel­op­ment in Singapore.</p>
    <p>Other launches in the city fringe and mass-mar­ket re­gions in­clude The Reef at King’s Dock, One-North</p>
    <p>Eden, The Ryse Res­i­dences and Phoenix Res­i­dences, and ex­ec­u­tive con­do­mini­ums Provence Res­i­dence and Parc Cen­tral Res­i­dences.</p>
    <p>4. HDB mar­ket emerg­ing from the dol­drums</p>
    <p>The HDB re­sale mar­ket seems to be emerg­ing from the dol­drums af­ter the Govern­ment re­leased a slew of pol­icy mea­sures to im­prove hous­ing af­ford­abil­ity for Sin­ga­pore­ans and in­crease older flats’ at­trac­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>De­spite the pan­demic and the in­creas­ing sup­ply of flats, HDB re­sale flat prices rose 1.5 per cent quar­ter on quar­ter in the third quar­ter of last year, af­ter in­creas­ing marginally by 0.3 per cent in the pre­ced­ing quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The monthly re­sale vol­ume hit more than 2,400 trans­ac­tions for five con­sec­u­tive months last year. Many sell­ers raised their ask­ing prices amid the mar­ket ex­u­ber­ance and stel­lar sales in re­cent months. Sev­eral re­sale flats were trans­acted above val­u­a­tion as many buy­ers paid cash over val­u­a­tion for flats in pop­u­lar lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Buy­ing in­ter­est will re­main healthy for lower-priced or at­trac­tively priced flats. For in­stance, some re­sale flats in non-ma­ture es­tates drew strong buyer in­ter­est, es­pe­cially in</p>
    <p>Buy­ing in­ter­est will re­main healthy for lower-priced or at­trac­tively priced flats. For in­stance, some re­sale flats in non-ma­ture es­tates drew strong buyer in­ter­est, es­pe­cially in Yishun and Wood­lands, where prices tend to be lower than in other hous­ing es­tates.</p>
    <p>Yishun and Wood­lands, where prices tend to be lower than in other hous­ing es­tates.</p>
    <p>The soft em­ploy­ment mar­ket may con­tinue to see some fam­i­lies down­grad­ing to HDB flats, but cou­ples who are still do­ing well in their jobs may sell their flats and up­grade to pri­vate homes. We an­tic­i­pate that the HDB re­sale vol­ume may rise be­tween 5 per cent and 10 per cent, to around 22,000 to 25,000 units this year. Prices of re­sale flats may in­crease by 2 per cent to 4 per cent.</p>
