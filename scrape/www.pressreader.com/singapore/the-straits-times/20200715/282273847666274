    <p>BER­LIN • Last month’s ill-fated Adria Tour has been widely bashed by crit­ics for its lax stance on safe dis­tanc­ing and af­ter-event par­ties amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, lead­ing to pos­i­tive tests for world No. 1 No­vak Djokovic and fel­low ten­nis pro­fes­sion­als Vik­tor Troicki, Grigor Dim­itrov and Borna Coric.</p>
    <p>The string of i nfec­tions also meant the fi­nal leg of the ex­hi­bi­tion se­ries in Bos­nia had to be can­celled and world No. 3 Do­minic Thiem, who played in the event, has ad­mit­ted that those in­volved had to take those lessons on board.</p>
    <p>“We have to learn from the mis­takes and be care­ful nowa­days with this pan­demic we are fac­ing. That’s what we have to take from the Adria Tour,” he said on Mon­day, ahead of this week’s Bet­t1Aces ex­hi­bi­tion event in Ber­lin.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Aus­trian, who like his peers was filmed par­ty­ing in a night­club, dou­bled down on his de­fence of Djokovic and Co, in­sist­ing the crit­i­cism had been way over the top.</p>
    <p>“No­vak and the oth­ers didn’t com­mit any crimes, you have to make that point,” Thiem said. “The fact we were crit­i­cised isn’t un­fair be­cause we all made mis­takes. That’s clear. But it was way too much at the end, be­cause the whole tour­na­ment was well in­tended.”</p>
    <p>He also hit out at world No. 40 Nick Kyr­gios, who has been vo­cal in his crit­i­cism of the Adria Tour, call­ing the Aus­tralian’s com­ments “un­nec­es­sary”.</p>
    <p>The pair have traded in­sults over Twit­ter af­ter Kyr­gios at­tacked sev­enth-ranked Alexan­der Zverev for be­ing “self­ish”.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man, an­other tour par­tic­i­pant, was seen in a night­club de­spite promis­ing to self-iso­late fol­low­ing a neg­a­tive test af­ter play­ing in the event, but Thiem claimed the “sub­ject is done”.</p>
    <p>On the US Open, which is sched­uled to start on Aug 31, last year’s French Open fi­nal­ist re­mains doubt­ful the hard-court Grand Slam can go ahead.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve the de­ci­sion is not in our hands, but in those of the US Ten­nis Fed­er­a­tion, the US gov­ern­ment and the Mayor of New York,” said Thiem. “The whole thing is on very shaky legs. But I also be­lieve that if it is played, it will be safe for every­one. We’ll def­i­nitely be in a huge bub­ble.”</p>
    <p>Barbara Rit­tner, Bet­t1Aces’ tour­na­ment di­rec­tor, has said clean­li­ness is the fo­cus for the week-long event to help re­pair dam­age done to the per­cep­tion of the sport in the wake of Djokovic’s tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>She added that or­gan­is­ers want to “de­bunk this im­age that the ten­nis scene has ar­ro­gant play­ers who don’t take hy­giene mea­sures se­ri­ously”.</p>
