    <p>Mar­ket­ing man­ager Koh Wei Ming, 37, bought a wire­less charg­ing stand last week, af­ter his Ap­ple iPhone X’s charg­ing pins be­came loose and he could not plug in the charg­ing cable.</p>
    <p>He is al­ready rel­ish­ing his short time go­ing cable­less, lov­ing “the ease with which you can charge your phone with­out the need of ca­bles”, which he feels is the big­gest ad­van­tage of wire­less charg­ing.</p>
    <p>“As my job is desk-bound, hav­ing a good wire­less charg­ing stand also keeps my desk neater,” he adds.</p>
    <p>Wire­less charg­ing, es­pe­cially for smart­phones, has been gain­ing pop­u­lar­ity due to the in­creas­ing adop­tion of the Qi wire­less charg­ing stan­dard by var­i­ous smart­phone-mak­ers, such as Sam­sung, Ap­ple and Google, said mar­ket re­search firm BIS Re­search.</p>
    <p>Qi is an open stan­dard for wire­less power trans­fer us­ing in­duc­tive charg­ing, de­vel­oped by the Wire­less Power Con­sor­tium (WPC). Sam­sung adopted the stan­dard in 2015 and Ap­ple did the same in 2018 with the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket in­tel­li­gence firm Fact.MR said the global de­mand for wire­less charg­ing stands grew at more than 15 per cent an­nu­ally in 2018 and last year, reach­ing a mar­ket size of nearly US$7 bil­lion (S$9.75 bil­lion) last year.</p>
    <p>In BIS Re­search’s lat­est Global Wire­less Charg­ing Mar­ket – Anal­y­sis And Fore­cast re­port, the firm said it ex­pects the mar­ket to ex­pand at a com­pound an­nual growth rate of 41.79 per cent from last year to 2024, ris­ing from US$5.84 bil­lion to US$33.48 bil­lion in an­nual mar­ket size over the pe­riod. This mar­ket com­prises only the com­po­nents used for Qi stan­dard-based wire­less charg­ing sys­tems.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for on­line re­tailer Lazada says that sales of wire­less charg­ers in Sin­ga­pore have been ris­ing, with the av­er­age num­ber of such de­vices sold a day now three to four times the num­ber two years ago.</p>
    <p>Mr San­tosh Ku­mar, se­nior con­sul­tant at Fact.MR, says the pri­mary rea­son for the pop­u­lar­ity of wire­less charg­ing stands is the con­ve­nience.</p>
    <p>Mr Eshan Hira, se­nior an­a­lyst at BIS Re­search, adds that “in­creas­ing bat­tery anx­i­ety” among con­sumers and ris­ing ship­ments of smart hand­held de­vices are also fu­elling the de­mand for wire­less charg­ers.</p>
    <p>Mo­bile ac­ces­sories-maker Moshi says the stand de­sign “pro­vides a more suit­able view­ing an­gle for no­ti­fi­ca­tions when used on a desk or side ta­ble” and that “there has been grow­ing in­ter­est” in this seg­ment.</p>
    <p>Brand­ing con­sul­tant Priscilla Cheong, 33, bought her first wire­less charg­ing stand about a year ago.</p>
    <p>She says: “While wire­less charg­ing might be slower than wired charg­ing, it is bet­ter than let­ting my smart­phone go flat.” Plus, she feels that us­ing her wire­less charg­ing stand, which props up her smart­phone at a com­fort­able view­ing an­gle, is con­ve­nient.</p>
    <p>“I can see no­ti­fi­ca­tions on my smart­phone and tap on them while still work­ing on my lap­top,” she says.</p>
    <p>One ob­sta­cle to wire­less charg­ing growth is the lack of fast charg­ers at the mo­ment. Mr Hira notes that slow charg­ing speed is “the ma­jor chal­lenge faced by mar­ket play­ers presently”.</p>
    <p>But that is chang­ing with ad­vance­ments in the Qi stan­dard. In the past, many wire­less charg­ers were lim­ited to a spec­i­fi­ca­tion called Base­line Power Pro­file, which sup­ports up to 5W of power out­put. In 2015, the Ex­tended Power Pro­file spec­i­fi­ca­tion, which sup­ports up to 15W, was in­tro­duced.</p>
    <p>Last year, WPC in­tro­duced the Pro­pri­etary Power De­liv­ery Ex­ten­sion (PPDE). It is a tech­nol­ogy that al­lows WPC mem­bers – which in­clude Ap­ple, Sam­sung, Nokia, Huawei and other orig­i­nal equip­ment­mak­ers – to de­velop their own wire­less charg­ers to de­liver higher than 15W of wire­less charg­ing power.</p>
    <p>Moshi, which just launched its first wire­less charg­ing stand, which sup­ports fast charg­ing at up to 15W, says it is an­tic­i­pat­ing con­tin­ued de­mand for wire­less charg­ers in the fu­ture with ad­vance­ments in the Qi tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Sam­sung was the first man­u­fac­turer to adopt PPDE last year, while Huawei last month launched a wire­less charg­ing stand that sup­ports up to 40W.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times looks at eight wire­less charg­ing stands in the mar­ket.</p>
