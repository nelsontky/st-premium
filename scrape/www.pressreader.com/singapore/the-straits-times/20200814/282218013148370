    <p>PARIS • No­vak Djokovic yesterday con­firmed he will play at the US Open, end­ing spec­u­la­tion about his pres­ence at the first Grand Slam ten­nis tour­na­ment since the coro­n­avirus pan­demic shut down the sport in March.</p>
    <p>“I’m happy to con­firm that I’ll par­tic­i­pate at #Cin­cyTen­nis and #USOpen this year,” the 17-time Grand Slam win­ner tweeted.</p>
    <p>“It was not an easy de­ci­sion to make with all the ob­sta­cles and chal­lenges on many sides, but the prospect of com­pet­ing again makes me re­ally ex­cited.”</p>
    <p>The US Open is due to get un­der­way be­hind closed doors in New York on Aug 31 and will be pre­ceded by the Western and South­ern Open, which is nor­mally played in Cincinnati, but has been moved to Flush­ing Mead­ows this year ow­ing to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>His de­ci­sion to take part is a ma­jor boost for the US Open after a host of stars, in­clud­ing de­fend­ing and four-time cham­pion Rafael Nadal and women’s world No. 1 Ash­leigh Barty, pulled out.</p>
    <p>Among the other no­table names miss­ing are Nick Kyr­gios, Svet­lana Kuznetsova, Stan Wawrinka, Elina Svi­tolina, Barbora Strycova and</p>
    <p>Kiki Bertens, while women’s world No. 2 and Wim­ble­don cham­pion Si­mona Halep is said to be sit­ting on the fence.</p>
    <p>Roger Fed­erer, with a record 20</p>
    <p>Slams in­clud­ing five US Open ti­tles, is out after knee surgery.</p>
    <p>Djokovic makes his com­pet­i­tive re­turn after be­ing crit­i­cised for host­ing a char­ity ten­nis event in</p>
    <p>June at which he and a raft of play­ers tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>His con­fir­ma­tion also came after he ini­tially ex­pressed scep­ti­cism that the tour­na­ment would go ahead, de­scrib­ing the cap on play­ers’ en­tourages at the tour­na­ment as “ex­treme” and “im­pos­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>He wrote on his web­site: “I am aware that this time around it will be very dif­fer­ent with all the pro­to­cols and safety mea­sures that are put in place to pro­tect play­ers and peo­ple of New York.</p>
    <p>“Nev­er­the­less, I’ve trained hard with my team and got my body in shape so I am ready to adapt to new con­di­tions.”</p>
    <p>The Serb, who was in­fected by Covid-19 dur­ing his ill-fated Adria Tour ex­hi­bi­tion in the Balkans, also re­it­er­ated that he had re­cov­ered and com­pleted “all (sub­se­quent) check-ups” and was “ready to get back on court fully com­mit­ted to play­ing my best ten­nis”.</p>
    <p>The win­ner of a record eighth Aus­tralian Open be­fore the sea­son went into lock­down, Djokovic added that he re­spected and ap­pre­ci­ated the “time, ef­fort, and en­ergy” taken to put on the two USbased events.</p>
