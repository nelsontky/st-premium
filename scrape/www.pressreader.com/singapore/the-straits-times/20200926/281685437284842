    <p>He knew from the mo­ment his doc­tor told him he would have to be in­tu­bated that death would be just a whis­per away.</p>
    <p>“I told him that if you do that, I’d al­ready have one foot in the grave,” Mr Judd de Leon, a re­cruit­ment spe­cial­ist at tal­ents firm Cielo, re­called.</p>
    <p>It was mid-July. He had heard those sto­ries about how it was a death sen­tence for pa­tients with Covid-19 to go on a ven­ti­la­tor. So, when his doc­tor told him his only op­tion was that, he baulked.</p>
    <p>His oxy­gen sat­u­ra­tion level had plum­meted to 67, when it should have been be­tween 95 and 100.</p>
    <p>“It felt like some­one was stran­gling me,” he said.</p>
    <p>But the thought of thick plas­tic tubes run­ning down his nose and throat into his lungs also ter­ri­fied him. In­side his head, he be­gan to make fu­neral plans for him­self.</p>
    <p>“I felt that if I should kick the bucket, it would be okay. My in­sur­ance would cover the hos­pi­tal bill and my burial,” he said.</p>
    <p>But his doc­tor in­sisted: “If you don’t do it, you’ll die.”</p>
    <p>His sis­ters also pleaded with him. That tipped the scales.</p>
    <p>“My mother had passed away just eight months prior, and I saw how dis­traught my sis­ters were.</p>
    <p>I couldn’t bear the thought of see­ing them mourn again if I died. We still had a lot of things we wanted to do as a fam­ily,” said Mr de Leon, who has a part­ner.</p>
    <p>He gave in. But, un­con­scious when he was hooked up to a ven­ti­la­tor, he awoke to the grip of a panic.</p>
    <p>“I was all alone. When I woke up, the first thing I no­ticed was the tube down my throat. I was star­tled. I had that feel­ing that I was chok­ing on that tube, and peo­ple were just pass­ing by. I was wav­ing at them, and they were not see­ing me. I was cry­ing. I was re­ally afraid of dy­ing there alone,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr de Leon did not think he would ever get Covid-19. At 40, he was still young and fit. He ran marathons at less than five hours. He climbed moun­tains. He did not smoke or drink al­co­hol.</p>
    <p>He had not been out of his flat since the gov­ern­ment placed the cap­i­tal, Manila, on a sweep­ing lock­down in mid-March. He or­dered ev­ery­thing on­line, and would dis­in­fect ev­ery­thing that was de­liv­ered, re­heat­ing food to make sure it was safe to eat.</p>
    <p>If there was a cul­prit, he sus­pected it was from a de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>He spent nine days in in­ten­sive care, wrestling with his thoughts and feel­ing like a rag doll.</p>
    <p>He had noth­ing on but a hos­pi­tal gown and an adult di­a­per. He could not sit or stand up, or walk to the toi­let.</p>
    <p>The nurses did ev­ery­thing. Every six hours, a nurse would feed him a milky so­lu­tion through the tube in his nose. The liq­uid diet caused bad di­ar­rhoea, he said, and a nurse had to come in and clean him up con­stantly.</p>
    <p>“The first time they changed my di­a­per, I felt very vul­ner­a­ble and pow­er­less be­cause I was naked and I was covered in poop,” he said.</p>
    <p>Every day, fluid and phlegm had to be suc­tioned out of his lungs seven to 10 times.</p>
    <p>“It felt like drown­ing for about a minute or two,” he said.</p>
    <p>Twice, dur­ing one of th­ese pro­ce­dures, he felt his heart stop.</p>
    <p>It was not like in the movies, he said. There was no out-of-body ex­pe­ri­ence. There was no light draw­ing him in.</p>
    <p>“Time slowed down. Ev­ery­thing went grey. Ev­ery­thing slowed down, and there was to­tal si­lence,” he said.</p>
    <p>To pull him­self through each day, he had an hour to use his phone. He would video-call his fam­ily and friends, and check his so­cial me­dia feeds and mes­sages.</p>
    <p>The nurses were also en­cour­ag­ing him. “They were al­ways telling me I’m still young. I didn’t have pre-ex­ist­ing con­di­tions. My blood pres­sure and heart rate were okay. I had ev­ery­thing go­ing for me to sur­vive,” he said.</p>
    <p>To give him­self a boost, he framed his or­deal against the sto­ry­line of an anime, Haikyu. It was about a vol­ley­ball team over­com­ing in­cred­i­ble odds to come out on top.</p>
    <p>“When­ever I had dif­fi­culty breath­ing, I would re­call their one match when, just when all seemed lost, they some­how were able to get up and win.”</p>
    <p>But by his sev­enth day in in­ten­sive care, he was so weak and ex­hausted that not even the daily calls to his l oved ones or his favourite anime could lift him.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t want to fight any more,” he said.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, by then, his body had be­gun to re­spond to the treat­ment of a cock­tail of an­tivi­ral drugs and painkiller­s. His tubes were re­moved on the ninth day, and he was moved to a reg­u­lar ward a day later.</p>
    <p>There, for eight days, he be­gan to piece back to­gether ev­ery­thing that Covid-19 had taken apart. He be­gan to eat and bathe on his own. He walked. He breathed.</p>
    <p>In all, he was in hos­pi­tal for 20 days, but more than a month later, he is still strug­gling with the scars the coro­n­avirus left be­hind.</p>
    <p>His heart and lungs still feel weak. His doc­tor has ad­vised him to start tak­ing long walks, but the far­thest he has man­aged with­out be­com­ing short of breath is just out­side the gate of his apart­ment com­plex.</p>
    <p>His ex­penses ran up to 1.4 mil­lion pe­sos (S$40,000), de­plet­ing his sav­ings. “But that’s j ust money. What’s im­por­tant is I’m alive. This is a chance to re­build,” he said in a post on Face­book.</p>
    <p>“Life is pre­cious. Don’t waste it.”</p>
