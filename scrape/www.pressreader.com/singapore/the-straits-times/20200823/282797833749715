    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Eric, from Illi­nois, perched on a stool in a cor­ner of his house with a drink in hand, record­ing him­self on his phone in a video broad­cast to the mil­lions watch­ing the Demo­cratic Na­tional Con­ven­tion (DNC) on Monday.</p>
    <p>“Fairly ashamed to say it, I’m one of many who voted for the cur­rent Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump,” he said, be­fore declar­ing that he had reg­is­tered as a Demo­crat for the first time in his life.</p>
    <p>“I’m do­ing that be­cause I think this elec­tion is big­ger than any po­lit­i­cal party,” said Eric, who gave only his first name.</p>
    <p>He slammed Mr Trump’s rhetoric as di­vi­sive and dan­ger­ous, crit­i­cis­ing him for hav­ing es­sen­tially “zero plat­form right now, four months out from the elec­tion”.</p>
    <p>The video was one of sev­eral dur­ing the DNC which fea­tured former elected Repub­li­cans and pre­vi­ous Trump vot­ers stump­ing for the Demo­cratic can­di­date</p>
    <p>Joe Bi­den, in an ap­peal to swing vot­ers and waver­ing Repub­li­cans to vote blue on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>To­gether, they sought to send the mes­sage that choos­ing be­tween Mr Bi­den and Mr Trump went be­yond party loy­alty, while show­ing that their can­di­date is mod­er­ate enough to at­tract big Repub­li­can names.</p>
    <p>“The Bi­den cam­paign was try­ing to sig­nal that all are wel­come into the Demo­cratic fold and that op­po­si­tion to Don­ald Trump does not mean their de­ci­sion should be to stay home,” said Brook­ings In­sti­tu­tion se­nior fel­low in gov­er­nance stud­ies John Hu­dak, in a com­men­tary on the think-tank’s web­site.</p>
    <p>While it is com­mon for party con­ven­tions to fea­ture mem­bers of the other party who have had a change of heart, this year’s elec­tion is largely a ref­er­en­dum on Mr Trump’s pres­i­dency and a chance for Democrats to con­vince Repub­li­cans who dis­ap­prove of him to cross the aisle.</p>
    <p>Their choice is be­tween vot­ing for Mr Bi­den and stay­ing home, putting the onus on Mr Bi­den to con­vince them that he is the safer bet, Dr Hu­dak wrote.</p>
    <p>Former Ohio gov­er­nor John Ka­sich, who spoke on the first night of the DNC, de­scribed him­self as a life­long Repub­li­can but said “that at­tach­ment holds sec­ond place to my re­spon­si­bil­ity to my coun­try”.</p>
    <p>“Many of us have been deeply con­cerned about the cur­rent path we’ve been fol­low­ing for the past four years. It’s a path that’s led to divi­sion, dys­func­tion, ir­re­spon­si­bil­ity and grow­ing vit­riol be­tween our cit­i­zens,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Con­tin­u­ing to fol­low that path will have ter­ri­ble con­se­quences for Amer­ica’s soul be­cause we’re be­ing taken down the wrong road by a pres­i­dent who has pit­ted one against the other,” he added.</p>
    <p>Former New Jersey gov­er­nor Chris­tine Todd Whit­man, another life­long Repub­li­can, praised Mr Bi­den as a per­son who could work with both par­ties to get things done, un­like Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>“This isn’t about a Repub­li­can or</p>
    <p>Demo­crat. It’s about a per­son. A per­son de­cent enough, sta­ble enough, strong enough to get our econ­omy back on track,” she said at the vir­tual con­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>Other Repub­li­cans who en­dorsed Mr Bi­den dur­ing the DNC touted him as some­one who had the busi­ness acu­men and val­ues that Mr Trump lacked, ex­plic­itly ap­prov­ing of his per­son­al­ity and im­plic­itly sug­gest­ing they could get be­hind enough of his agenda to vote for him.</p>
    <p>Former Hewlett-Packard chief ex­ec­u­tive Meg Whit­man, who ran as a Repub­li­can for gov­er­nor of Cal­i­for­nia in 2010, said Mr Trump had no clue how to run a busi­ness, let alone an econ­omy, be­fore prais­ing Mr Bi­den as some­one who would help work­ing peo­ple and small busi­ness own­ers.</p>
    <p>De­spite Mr Trump’s tout­ing of his prow­ess as a busi­ness­man, his record had been patchy, with a string of fail­ures over the years in his for­ays into casi­nos, air­lines and other in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>Former sec­re­tary of state Colin Pow­ell said Mr Bi­den would be a com­man­der-in-chief who takes care of Amer­i­can troops and would re­store US lead­er­ship in the world.</p>
    <p>“With Joe Bi­den in the White House, you will never doubt that he will stand with our friends and stand up to our ad­ver­saries – never the other way around. He will trust our di­plo­mats and our in­tel­li­gence com­mu­nity, not the flat­tery of dic­ta­tors and despots,” said Mr Pow­ell, who served un­der Repub­li­can pres­i­dent Ge­orge W. Bush from 2001 to 2005.</p>
    <p>They join the cho­rus of prom­i­nent Repub­li­cans who have de­nounced their party’s pres­i­dent in re­cent months, a group that in­cludes Mr Bush, Utah Sen­a­tor Mitt Rom­ney, former de­fence sec­re­tary Jim Mat­tis and former na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser John Bolton.</p>
    <p>Some “Never Trumper” Repub­li­cans have banded to­gether to form the Lin­coln Pro­ject, a con­ser­va­tive group known for its hard-hit­ting anti-Trump ads.</p>
    <p>Yet, for the Repub­li­cans who spoke at the DNC, the force of their en­dorse­ment could be di­min­ished be­cause most of them are not sit­ting law­mak­ers or cur­rent ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>They and other crit­ics can also be eas­ily por­trayed as hav­ing griev­ances against Mr Trump: Mr Rom­ney and Mr Ka­sich were de­feated by Mr Trump in the 2016 pres­i­den­tial pri­mary con­test, while Mr Bolton was fired by Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>More­over, some Repub­li­cans like Mr Rom­ney and Mr Bolton, who said they will not vote for Mr Trump, have also not en­dorsed Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Still, a Pew Re­search poll re­leased on Aug 13 showed that most reg­is­tered vot­ers who sup­port Mr Bi­den and those who lean to­wards sup­port­ing him back him be­cause he is not Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Some 56 per cent said they sup­ported him be­cause he is not Mr Trump, with the next biggest fac­tors – his lead­er­ship and his per­son­al­ity – trail­ing far be­hind at 19 per cent and 13 per cent re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Other Repub­li­cans who en­dorsed Mr Bi­den dur­ing the DNC touted him as some­one who had the busi­ness acu­men and val­ues that Mr Trump lacked, ex­plic­itly ap­prov­ing of his per­son­al­ity and im­plic­itly sug­gest­ing they could get be­hind enough of his agenda to vote for him.</p>
