    <p>FairPrice apol­o­gised yes­ter­day af­ter a video of a bat feed­ing on a comb of ba­nanas at the su­per­mar­ket chain’s 24-hour store in Jurong East made the rounds on­line.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day af­ter­noon, FairPrice said it was aware of the vi­ral video of the in­ci­dent out­side the out­let at Block 345 Jurong East Street 31 where the fruits were dis­played.</p>
    <p>But it is un­clear when the video was filmed.</p>
    <p>“We have since moved all fruits in­side the store to pre­vent fu­ture oc­cur­rences, and checks have also been made to en­sure any fruits af­fected have been dis­carded,” said FairPrice in the Face­book post.</p>
    <p>The gro­cery chain has con­tacted the au­thor­i­ties to look into the cause of the pres­ence of bats in the area. The Straits Times has con­tacted FairPrice for more de­tails.</p>
    <p>Animal Con­cerns Re­search and Ed­u­ca­tion So­ci­ety (Acres) deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive Kalai Vanan told ST that the bat in the video is a ju­ve­nile lesser dog-faced fruit bat, com­monly found in Sin­ga­pore, and even in res­i­den­tial ar­eas, as they feed on a va­ri­ety of wild flora. “In this case, the bat showed its op­por­tunis­tic na­ture by feed­ing on read­ily avail­able ba­nanas,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Kalai also said it was good that FairPrice moved the fruits in­side the store. “Mov­ing for­ward, we hope NTUC can look into al­ter­na­tive ways of dis­play­ing the fruits that will pre­vent (animal) ac­cess.”</p>
    <p>This is not the first time this year that bats have been spot­ted in ur</p>
    <p>ban places. Last month, bats flew into some res­i­dents’ homes in Block 14 Up­per Boon Keng Road.</p>
    <p>The Jalan Be­sar Town Coun­cil later pruned fruit trees near the af­fected block to dis­cour­age the bats from roost­ing there.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple have also be­come more jit­tery around bats here as they may be a source of the coro­n­avirus else­where in the world.</p>
    <p>A World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion sci­en­tist said in May that Sars-CoV-2,</p>
    <p>which causes Covid-19, comes from a group of viruses that orig­i­nate from or are spread by bats.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary, ST re­ported that the Sin­ga­pore au­thor­i­ties were re­ceiv­ing more bat-re­lated re­ports than usual, with some peo­ple wor­ried they may catch the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts told ST last month that it is highly un­likely that bats in Sin­ga­pore are car­ry­ing Sars-CoV-2.</p>
