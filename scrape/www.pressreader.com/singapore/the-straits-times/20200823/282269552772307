    <p>Hey! If we are go­ing to get through this pan­demic sane, in­tact and clean, we need big­ger hard­ware.</p>
    <p>We need machines that will clean our of­fices, wipe our noses, feed our chil­dren and empty our waste bas­kets while we work from home and won­der if things will ever be as they were. Un­til that day comes, there is Whiz.</p>
    <p>It is a vac­uum cleaner, or what its mak­ers – the Ja­pan-head­quar­tered SoftBank Ro­bot­ics call it – an au­ton­o­mous com­mer­cial floor­care ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence vac­uum clean­ing ro­bot that is like the gad­get you might al­ready have at home, but big­ger, heav­ier, smarter and a lot more ex­pen­sive.</p>
    <p>I am here at JLL, an in­te­grated fa­cil­i­ties ser­vices com­pany, at its Asia-Pa­cific head­quar­ters at Paya Le­bar Quar­ter. The com­pany is a Whiz user.</p>
    <p>It used to be buzzing with de­sign­ers and ac­counts ex­ec­u­tives be­fore the pan­demic, but to­day, no one is here. You can guess why.</p>
    <p>Car­pets still need to be vac­u­umed, peo­ple or no peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Mr Jack Liang, 31, a de­ploy­ment spe­cial­ist with SoftBank Ro­bot­ics Sin­ga­pore, has run through his brief­ing on how to op­er­ate this waist-high grey-and-white ma­chine that looks like an Ap­ple desk­top com­puter from the early 2000s.</p>
    <p>It has taken only 30 min­utes to teach me how to use it, with a big part of it in­volv­ing me re­mov­ing the brushes and clean­ing and re­plac­ing the pa­per bag waste con­tainer.</p>
    <p>Let’s say I am an un­cle or aun­tie who cleans the of­fice. On the first day of use, I switch Whiz on, poke at a cou­ple of icons on its dis­play, then use it as I would a nor­mal vac­uum, push­ing it along a path.</p>
    <p>That route is now stored for as long as I want. Whiz has space for hun­dreds more routes if needed. Now, each night, I press a but­ton and Whiz will hum along that path. It will never skip a night or hurry back to its home town be­fore the pan­demic shuts na­tional bor­ders, nor take a short­cut to save time.</p>
    <p>What makes it smart – and way more ex­pen­sive than a home ap­pli­ance – is that it solves prob­lems by it­self.</p>
    <p>If Whiz just copied my turns – that is, “turn left after 2m, then right after 3m” – it will even­tu­ally drift out of sync with the real world be­cause small dis­tance-mea­sure­ment er­rors will ac­cu­mu­late. The lit­tle guy will get lost.</p>
    <p>Through its bat­tery of sen­sors, Whiz pings its sur­round­ings to up­date the map in its brain, look­ing for ref­er­ence points and un­ex­pected ob­sta­cles, in­clud­ing hu­mans.</p>
    <p>“I’m at the cor­rect dis­tance from the wall over there and that pot­ted plant there, and here is the gap I should go through,” is what Whiz would say if it could speak out loud.</p>
    <p>The same tech­nol­ogy is found in self-driv­ing cars. If its path is blocked by, say, a per­son or a box, it would sense it at a dis­tance and find another route.</p>
    <p>And that is about it. It is set and for­get. End of story.</p>
    <p>Since Whiz launched here last year, around 300 of them have been leased by ho­tels, of­fices and re­tail busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>There is a bonus with ro­bots in va­cant of­fices: It will never cut cor­ners be­cause no one is around to watch it work or com­plain about the dusti­ness of the car­pet.</p>
    <p>I wish I could tell you more about what my job was that day, but that is the point of machines like Whiz – it takes away the dull stuff so I can do some­thing else.</p>
    <p>So if this was a work­ing of­fice in­stead of one that has been empty for weeks and I were a clean­ing un­cle, I might have a few pre­lim­i­nary tasks be­fore I switch Whiz on.</p>
    <p>Task one: Elim­i­nate Whiz’s No. 1 en­emy – chairs, ones that users scat­ter around the paths Whiz wants to take. As a cleaner, my job would be to stow away chairs, waste bas­kets and other Whiz-con­found­ing road­blocks.</p>
    <p>The ma­chine will not crash into them – it al­ways senses what is ahead – but it would be time wasted and a spot un-vac­u­umed.</p>
    <p>Also, since Whiz’s pro­por­tions do not al­low it to get un­der desks or tight spaces, hu­man labour will still be re­quired for nooks and cran­nies.</p>
    <p>As a goof, I try to make it bump into me. I lie down like a hu­man speed bump, sit, stand and walk in front of it, but each time, it will pause, wait for me to leave and, if I do not, it will go around me.</p>
    <p>In spite of how in­cred­i­bly an­noy­ing I am, Whiz does not swear at me or tell me it will file a po­lice re­port.</p>
    <p>I think if it were to be cus­tomised for Sin­ga­pore users, a pre-recorded threat about a po­lice re­port would be amaz­ing.</p>
