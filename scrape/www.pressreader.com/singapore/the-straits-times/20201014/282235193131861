    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s cen­tral bank chief said as much as 20 per cent of the citys­tate’s econ­omy faces “deep scar­ring” from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The avi­a­tion and tourism in­dus­tries are a worry, es­pe­cially with an ex­pected slow re­cov­ery in travel, Mr Ravi Menon, man­ag­ing direc­tor of the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS), said at a vir­tual event hosted by the In­sti­tute of In­ter­na­tional Fi­nance on Mon­day. About 10 per cent to 20 per cent of the econ­omy faces scar­ring from the virus, he added.</p>
    <p>“What is go­ing to hap­pen to that in­dus­try when the planes haven’t flown, the pi­lots haven’t flown for months on a stretch?” said Mr Menon. “It’s not like pick­ing up af­ter tak­ing two months off. When you take two years off, it’s very dif­fer­ent.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s trade-re­liant econ­omy, al­ready in re­ces­sion, is fac­ing its worst con­trac­tion on record of about 5 per cent to 7 per cent this year, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial es­ti­mates.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has al­lo­cated about $100 bil­lion in stim­u­lus to cush­ion the blow for busi­nesses and help save jobs.</p>
    <p>Mr Menon said he is aware of the risks of pro­long­ing sup­port, but the key is to taper the exit with­out pulling the rug out too sud­denly.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has not seen the full ex­tent of the cri­sis yet, he said, with more bad loans and bank­rupt­cies ex­pected through the start of next year. There is also a ques­tion of whether banks need to raise more cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>“What I’ve not heard, and I think peo­ple are be­gin­ning to talk about, is whether you need to raise new cap­i­tal,” he said. “It’s not go­ing to be easy in a time like this.”</p>
    <p>Mr Menon said he has seen a lot of pos­i­tive changes in the dig­i­tal econ­omy, and there is a greater con­scious­ness about sus­tain­abil­ity that has aligned with the MAS’ “big­gest to-do list” on en­vi­ron­men­tal, so­cial, and gov­er­nance ef­forts.</p>
    <p>“In a funny sort of way, the pan­demic has made us all a lot more sen­si­tive and aware of how vul­ner­a­ble we are to the forces of na­ture,” he said.</p>
    <p>What I’ve not heard, and I think peo­ple are be­gin­ning to talk about, is whether you need to raise new cap­i­tal. It’s not go­ing to be easy in a time like this.</p>
