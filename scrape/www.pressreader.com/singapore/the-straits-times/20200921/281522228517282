    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tain is at a tip­ping point on Covid-19, Health Min­is­ter Matt Han­cock said yes­ter­day, warn­ing that a sec­ond national lock­down could be im­posed if peo­ple do not fol­low gov­ern­ment rules de­signed to stop the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 cases have risen sharply in re­cent weeks to more than 4,000 a day, with Prime Min­is­ter Boris Johnson call­ing it a sec­ond wave, and stricter lock­down mea­sures be­ing in­tro­duced in ar­eas across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“The na­tion faces a tip­ping point and we have a choice,” Mr Han­cock told Sky News. “The choice is ei­ther that ev­ery­body fol­lows the rules... or we will have to take more mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>Mr Han­cock later told the BBC that a sec­ond national lock­down was a pos­si­ble op­tion. “I don’t rule it out, I don’t want to see it,” he said.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, Mr Johnson an­nounced fines of up to £10,000 (S$17,600) from next Mon­day for peo­ple in Eng­land who break new rules re­quir­ing them to self-iso­late if they have been in con­tact with some­one in­fected with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to tighter rules on so­cial gath­er­ings across the coun­try, sev­eral cities and re­gions in Bri­tain have im­posed “lo­cal lock­downs”, lim­it­ing even more strictly when, where and how many peo­ple can meet up so­cially.</p>
    <p>Mr Johnson said in a state­ment yes­ter­day: “The best way we can fight this virus is by ev­ery­one fol­low­ing the rules and self-iso­lat­ing if they’re at risk of pass­ing on the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>He added that “so no­body un­der­es­ti­mates just how im­por­tant this is, new reg­u­la­tions will mean you are legally obliged to do so if you have the virus” or have been asked to iso­late by the National Health Ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Asked about Lon­don Mayor Sadiq Khan’s com­ments last Fri­day that new re­stric­tions were in­creas­ingly likely in the cap­i­tal, Mr Han­cock said: “I’ve had dis­cus­sions this week with the Mayor of Lon­don, and the teams are meet­ing today to dis­cuss fur­ther what might be needed.”</p>
    <p>Mr Han­cock was also asked on Times Ra­dio about the pos­si­bil­ity of Lon­don­ers be­ing told to work from home later this week. He said: “Well, I wouldn’t rule it out.”</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion Labour Party leader Keir Starmer said he would sup­port what­ever mea­sures the gov­ern­ment brings for­ward, but crit­i­cised the test­ing sys­tem for not hav­ing the ca­pac­ity to deal with in­creased de­mand as schools re­opened.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain has been the worst-hit coun­try in Europe by the pan­demic, with nearly 42,000 deaths. Num­bers of new cases are reach­ing lev­els not seen since April, with some at­trib­uted to il­le­gal raves.</p>
    <p>For le­gal nightspots shut by the pan­demic, how­ever, there is no know­ing when they will re­open.</p>
    <p>It has been six months since the mu­sic and lights have been turned off at Lon­don’s Print­works, a for­mer news­pa­per print­ing fac­to­ry­turned-night­club, and sim­i­lar dance venues across Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>“We’re fight­ing for our sur­vival,” Print­works’ co-founder Simeon Al­dred told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>Just a few months ago, the nightspot wel­comed up to 5,000 club­bers an evening.</p>
    <p>Mr Al­dred is un­sure whether he and his busi­ness part­ner will have to lay off the 400 staff work­ing across all their venues or plan for re­open­ings, pos­si­bly early next year.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been burn­ing our own (cash) re­sources,” he said, while de­plor­ing what he sees as a lack of gov­ern­ment vis­i­bil­ity. “It won’t go back to ex­actly the way it was, but I think peo­ple will still want to come to­gether, eat to­gether, pray to­gether and dance to­gether.”</p>
    <p>Mr Peter Marks, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Deltic, one of Bri­tain’s largest night­club groups, with 53 venues, fears bank­ruptcy.</p>
    <p>“We’ve come from a very suc­cess­ful, healthy com­pany to one brought to its knees,” he told Agence France-Presse, not­ing that the clo­sures are still cost­ing it mil­lions of pounds in rent and other fixed costs. This is de­spite gov­ern­ment sup­port with pay­ing staff wages and giv­ing tax cuts.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Night Time In­dus­tries As­so­ci­a­tion, Bri­tish night­clubs – to­gether with bars, pubs, restau­rants and the­atres – gen­er­ate £66 bil­lion an­nu­ally and em­ploy about 1.3 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>While the gov­ern­ment has been pay­ing the bulk of wages for mil­lions of work­ers dur­ing the pan­demic, its fur­lough scheme is set to end next month, with an­a­lysts fore­cast­ing a surge in un­em­ploy­ment as a re­sult.</p>
    <p>A gov­ern­ment state­ment said: “We know this is an in­cred­i­bly dif­fi­cult time for night­clubs, but they will need to re­main closed for now, in line with cur­rent sci­en­tific ad­vice to con­trol the virus. We con­tinue to en­gage with in­dus­try rep­re­sen­ta­tives and lis­ten to their con­cerns.”</p>
    <p>While ac­knowl­edg­ing the risks, Mr Marks be­lieves clubs can re­open safely. “We don’t want to cause a spike in cases, but we think we can have a way to come back with pro­to­cols to re­duce the risks,” he said.</p>
