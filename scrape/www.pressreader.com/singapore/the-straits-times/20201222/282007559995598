    <p>Af­ter spend­ing most of this year shield­ing from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic by mostly keep­ing away from pub­lic events, Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin braved Moscow’s icy winds for a rare ap­pear­ance at the week­end to at­tend a me­morable cer­e­mony: the 100th an­niver­sary since the foun­da­tion of Rus­sia’s For­eign In­tel­li­gence Ser­vice, the SVR.</p>
    <p>A for­mer spy him­self, Mr Putin ev­i­dently rel­ished the com­pany of fel­low spooks. And, of course, he was far too po­lite to re­fer to what is, with­out doubt, his spies’ lat­est out­stand­ing achieve­ment: the ap­par­ently suc­cess­ful pen­e­tra­tion of much of the United States’ crit­i­cal na­tional cy­ber in­fra­struc­ture, an op­er­a­tion which is al­ready be­ing de­scribed as one of the most ex­ten­sive hack­ing episodes in his­tory.</p>
    <p>Nonethe­less, the Rus­sian Pres­i­dent’s sat­is­fac­tion with the work of his agents was ev­i­dent. “I would like to thank you once again for your ser­vice to the moth­er­land; I cer­tainly know that you have re­li­able, coura­geous peo­ple in your ranks,” a beam­ing Mr Putin told the SVR of­fi­cers over the week­end.</p>
    <p>There is no ques­tion that the US hack­ing is a re­minder of Rus­sia’s en­dur­ing tech­no­log­i­cal prow­ess. Still, revelation­s of this op­er­a­tion are com­ing at an awk­ward time for Mr Putin, just as the new Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion is pre­par­ing to take of­fice in Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>And although the Rus­sians seem to be cur­rently dic­tat­ing the pace of their cy­ber con­fronta­tion with the Amer­i­cans, they may dis­cover that their lat­est tri­umph could prove to be just one too many, un­leash­ing a far more in­tense con­flict with the US.</p>
    <p>Who­dun­nit mat­ters</p>
    <p>At­tri­bu­tion is, of course, the most con­tro­ver­sial as­pect of any cy­ber at­tack, partly be­cause it is so easy to fake on­line iden­ti­ties and lo­ca­tions, but also be­cause hack­ing op­er­a­tions in­creas­ingly take place through third-party providers of soft­ware and com­puter ser­vices.</p>
    <p>With his cu­ri­ous de­ter­mi­na­tion to ab­solve Rus­sia of any ac­cu­sa­tions, US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump did not help mat­ters by mainly re­main­ing silent about the lat­est hack­ing af­fair, or by sub­se­quently ped­dling ac­cu­sa­tions that China may be be­hind the op­er­a­tion, a claim largely dis­missed by the US’ own in­tel­li­gence com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>For although some of the ev­i­dence is cir­cum­stan­tial and much of it re­leasable to the pub­lic, it is ev­i­dent that this is a so­phis­ti­cated op­er­a­tion which bears all the hall­marks, meth­ods, ca­pa­bil­i­ties and in­ten­tions of Rus­sia’s in­tel­li­gence ser­vices.</p>
    <p>A de­bate con­tin­ues among West­ern an­a­lysts on whether the main cul­prits are the SVR spooks whose an­niver­sary Mr Putin cel­e­brated this past week­end; whether the op­er­a­tion was in­stead mounted by the APT29 hacker col­lec­tive known by the nick­name “Cozy Bear”, which op­er­ates un­der the FSB, Rus­sia’s do­mes­tic in­tel­li­gence ser­vice; or, fi­nally, whether this is the work of a ri­val hack­ing group which calls it­self “Fancy Bear” and which is un­der the con­trol of the GRU, Rus­sia’s mil­i­tary in­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>The de­bate is not as ir­rel­e­vant as it may sound, for a de­fin­i­tive an­swer to this ques­tion can pro­vide crit­i­cal in­sights into Rus­sian de­ci­sion-mak­ing and in­tel­li­gence pri­or­i­ties.</p>
    <p>But for West­ern pol­i­cy­mak­ers, the broad con­clu­sion that this was a suc­cess­ful Rus­sian pen­e­tra­tion op­er­a­tion is good enough.</p>
    <p>The im­pli­ca­tions stem­ming from this are clear.</p>
    <p>Much of what the US has just ex­pe­ri­enced is the con­se­quence of tra­di­tional spy­ing, no dif­fer­ent from that ex­e­cuted for cen­turies with other means, and it would be churl­ish not to ad­mit that the US in­tel­li­gence com­mu­nity is do­ing the same to Rus­sian gov­ern­ment com­puter net­works.</p>
    <p>But not all hack­ing ac­tiv­i­ties have the same pur­pose. Some hack­ing is in­tended to pun­ish or dis­credit ri­val coun­tries, by prov­ing that they are pow­er­less to de­fend them­selves. That was prob­a­bly the case with Rus­sia’s mas­sive cy­ber at­tacks on the small north­ern Euro­pean state of Es­to­nia back in 2007.</p>
    <p>Some hack­ing is done in prepa­ra­tion for fu­ture ma­jor war­fare; that may be the case with Rus­sian hack­ers, who worked for a shad­owy state-spon­sored group pre­vi­ously iden­ti­fied as Drag­on­fly, or “En­er­getic Bear”, and who, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cials from the US Depart­ment of Home­land</p>
    <p>Se­cu­rity, broke into US elec­tric­ity util­ity com­pa­nies at var­i­ous points dur­ing the last decade.</p>
    <p>They lurked there not in order to steal elec­tric­ity or in­ter­fere with the grid, but be­cause they wish to be sure that, in any fu­ture con­fronta­tion, they could hit the US’ crit­i­cal in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>US of­fi­cials are keep­ing quiet about the kind of in­for­ma­tion that may have been com­pro­mised. But since most gov­ern­ment de­part­ments op­er­ate dif­fer­ent lev­els of se­cu­rity within their servers, it is pos­si­ble that the main ob­jec­tive of the cur­rent hack­ing ac­tiv­i­ties is to cap­ture large amounts of per­sonal data on US gov­ern­ment civil ser­vants.</p>
    <p>Much of this per­sonal data is ini­tially use­less, but some – that be­long­ing to de­ci­sion-mak­ers, ad­min­is­tra­tors, or se­nior civil ser­vants – is price­less, for who­ever is armed with such de­tails can then pro­ceed to fol­low such peo­ple more closely, work out their daily rou­tines, iden­tify their per­sonal weak­nesses for fu­ture black­mail ac­tiv­i­ties and po­ten­tial spy­ing re­cruit­ment.</p>
    <p>Per­sonal in­for­ma­tion stolen through hack­ing is also very use­ful in pre­par­ing “phish­ing e-mails”, mes­sages which trick the reader into be­liev­ing that they come from friends or fam­ily, but which once opened in­stall spy­ing soft­ware on com­put­ers; the more such e-mails use per­sonal in­for­ma­tion, the higher the chance that they would fool their in­tended re­cip­i­ents.</p>
    <p>Con­stant bat­tle</p>
    <p>De­fend­ing against such threats is not a bi­nary choice be­tween suc­cess and fail­ure; this is a con­stant bat­tle and one in which each gov­ern­ment is just one step ahead of dis­as­ter, as tech­nolo­gies evolve all the time.</p>
    <p>The re­al­ity re­mains that Rus­sia has al­ways been highly com­pet­i­tive in this field: It has plenty of first-class math­e­ma­ti­cians and cy­ber spe­cial­ists, and in­vest­ing in of­fen­sive cy­ber ca­pa­bil­i­ties is not pro­hib­i­tively ex­pen­sive. So, while the US can beat Rus­sia hands down in any arms race, the fight is much more evenly bal­anced when it comes to cy­berspace.</p>
    <p>The lat­est in­tru­sions do, how­ever, raise some in­ter­est­ing ad­di­tional ques­tions.</p>
    <p>The first is over the de­ci­sion-mak­ing struc­ture in­side gov­ern­ments once they are hacked. We now know that the lat­est US in­tru­sion was first de­tected around March or April and that in­di­vid­ual Amer­i­can gov­ern­ment de­part­ments and agen­cies took some de­fen­sive mea­sures straight away.</p>
    <p>Yet it ap­pears that there was no over­all de­ci­sion to look at the safety of the en­tire gamut of gov­ern­ment cy­ber plat­forms un­til much later. Cen­tral­is­ing re­sponses against cy­ber hacks is a les­son which many gov­ern­ments are likely to draw from the lat­est episode.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond ma­jor prob­lem raised by the US cy­ber hacks is the proper di­vi­sion be­tween gov­ern­ments and pri­vate con­trac­tors which hold vast amounts of data or sup­ply soft­ware and com­puter ser­vices to gov­ern­ments.</p>
    <p>Much of ev­ery na­tion’s crit­i­cal na­tional in­fra­struc­ture – banks, all util­ity in­stal­la­tions, roads and air­craft traf­fic con­trol sys­tems – ul­ti­mately de­pends on in­ter­linked com­puter sys­tems. For most com­pa­nies, their de­ci­sion to store data or trans­fer any ac­tiv­ity on­line is al­most al­ways based on con­ve­nience and cost-sav­ing con­sid­er­a­tions; their abil­ity to pro­tect such ac­tiv­i­ties against hack­ing is con­sid­ered only later, and it is of­ten just an af­ter­thought.</p>
    <p>Com­mer­cial firms hold just as much – if not more – data about peo­ple than gov­ern­ments; think of the in­for­ma­tion col­lected by your bank, your In­ter­net provider, your mo­bile phone com­pany or your su­per­mar­ket loy­alty card.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, com­mer­cial firms, such as cy­ber-se­cu­rity firm So­larWinds, which sup­plied ser­vices to the US gov­ern­ment, are now the venue of choice for hos­tile pen­e­tra­tions, the so-called “sup­ply chain at­tack” which ex­perts have warned about for quite some time.</p>
    <p>Some of it is highly so­phis­ti­cated: Look at the FireEye com­pany, the cy­ber-se­cu­rity sup­plier which not only had its sys­tems in­ter­fered with, but also had its so-called “red team” struc­ture – the in­ter­nal fa­cil­ity to mimic an op­po­nent’s in­tru­sion to test the se­cu­rity of its prod­ucts – com­pro­mised.</p>
    <p>In the fu­ture, gov­ern­ments will have to de­cide whether to con­tinue re­ly­ing on out­side sup­pli­ers for such ser­vices. The temp­ta­tion to con­tinue as be­fore is there: Ex­ter­nal sup­pli­ers are more com­pet­i­tive and more in­no­va­tive, and they are also cheaper. But as the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion shows, this also cre­ates new vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>There is talk among in­com­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials about in­vest­ing a great deal of new money not only in beef­ing up US cy­ber de­fences, but also in es­tab­lish­ing funds to help other na­tions reach spe­cific pre­de­ter­mined cy­ber-se­cu­rity stan­dards. The ques­tion will rise to the top of the US’ di­a­logue with its al­lies. The word in­side the newly es­tab­lished US Cy­ber Com­mand is that although Wash­ing­ton wants to reach an ac­com­mo­da­tion with Rus­sia over the rules for such in­tru­sions, that will hap­pen only af­ter the US has made it clear to the Rus­sians that such op­er­a­tions do not pay. Ex­pect a spi­ralling cy­ber war­fare con­fronta­tion in the months to come.</p>
    <p>Need for re­view of cy­ber in­fra­struc­ture</p>
    <p>In­deed, the en­tire ques­tion of the se­cu­rity of com­mer­cial firms’ cy­ber in­fra­struc­ture needs to be looked at again, for many of th­ese firms are not ca­pa­ble of de­fend­ing them­selves against state ac­tors how­ever hard they try. And the cur­rent le­gal regime ap­plied in most West­ern coun­tries pro­vides com­pa­nies with few in­cen­tives to do bet­ter.</p>
    <p>In Bri­tain, for in­stance, com­pa­nies which re­port hack­ing in­tru­sions in­vari­ably end up be­ing heav­ily fined by the reg­u­la­tor for not do­ing enough to pro­tect their data­bases. The re­sult is not nec­es­sar­ily bet­ter pro­tec­tion, but less ac­cu­rate re­port­ing about what is hap­pen­ing.</p>
    <p>Yet prob­a­bly the most sig­nif­i­cant change which may come about out of the lat­est hack­ing into the US gov­ern­ment servers is the re­newed de­bate about the need for na­tions to re­spond to such at­tacks with their of­fen­sive cy­ber op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Un­til re­cently, the re­ceived wis­dom was that re­tal­ia­tory cy­ber op­er­a­tions are too dan­ger­ous and too un­cer­tain, as well as be­ing dif­fi­cult to jus­tify to pub­lic opin­ion.</p>
    <p>But this opin­ion is now chang­ing, with more and more politi­cians ar­gu­ing that un­less a de­ci­sive re­sponse is given for such op­er­a­tions, there is noth­ing to stop them. The an­swer does not need to be tit-for-tat but it can come in sub­tle ways, which can be pri­vately con­veyed to an op­po­nent.</p>
    <p>Mr Putin may feel pretty good now; his in­tel­li­gence ser­vices have proven their worth. But there is no ques­tion that the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion, which is al­ready fac­ing de­mands from Congress to be tougher on Rus­sia, is likely to re­spond in ways which Moscow may not find very com­fort­able.</p>
    <p>There is talk among in­com­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials about in­vest­ing a great deal of new money not only in beef­ing up US cy­ber de­fences, but also in es­tab­lish­ing funds to help other na­tions reach spe­cific pre­de­ter­mined cy­ber-se­cu­rity stan­dards. The ques­tion will rise to the top of the US’ di­a­logue with its al­lies.</p>
    <p>The word in­side the newly es­tab­lished US Cy­ber Com­mand is that although Wash­ing­ton wants to reach an ac­com­mo­da­tion with Rus­sia over the rules for such in­tru­sions, that will hap­pen only af­ter the US has made it clear to the Rus­sians that such op­er­a­tions do not pay.</p>
