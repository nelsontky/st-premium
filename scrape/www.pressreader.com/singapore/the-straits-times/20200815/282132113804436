    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has wors­ened the eco­nomic out­look for Sin­ga­pore dra­mat­i­cally. Sin­ga­pore­ans have been told to ex­pect even more job losses, re­trench­ment and hir­ing freezes.</p>
    <p>We need to make pro­tect­ing our own cit­i­zens and their liveli­hoods a pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>As a re­tired senior banker, I can say cat­e­gor­i­cally that in the past two decades, many for­eign­ers hired in Sin­ga­pore’s fi­nance sec­tor have been for up­per-mid­dle to senior man­age­ment po­si­tions (Banks say they keep strong lo­cal core in work­force, Aug 13).</p>
    <p>Once hired, these for­eign staff can eas­ily and in a short time se­cure their per­ma­nent res­i­dent (PR) sta­tus in Sin­ga­pore. There­fore, when analysing the ac­tual makeup of lo­cal staff, it is mis­lead­ing to com­bine the Sin­ga­pore­ans and</p>
    <p>PRs.</p>
    <p>The loss of lu­cra­tive pro­fes­sional, man­ager, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian jobs to for­eign­ers is a touchy is­sue in Sin­ga­pore in the cur­rent eco­nomic cir­cum­stances, and given that the bank­ing in­dus­try is a fairly ma­ture one, I would suggest the fol­low­ing:</p>
    <p>• Banks should pro­vide the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore and Man­power Min­istry with their work­force com­po­si­tion, de­tail­ing lo­cal hires (Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens only) ver­sus oth­ers (for­eign hires and PRs). The per­cent­age of Sin­ga­pore­ans mak­ing up the “senior” staff should also be pro­vided.</p>
    <p>• A min­i­mum per­cent­age of hired lo­cals against the to­tal work­force should be con­sid­ered, like 90 per cent for Sin­ga­pore banks and 85 per cent for non-Sin­ga­pore banks.</p>
    <p>It seems quite gen­er­ous to have some banks take in 30 per cent for­eign­ers for their com­mer­cial bank­ing op­er­a­tions in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>• Any ex­cep­tion to the work­force com­po­si­tion should re­quire spe­cial ap­proval from the reg­u­la­tory or gov­ern­ment au­thor­i­ties, again with ra­tio­nale sup­port­ing jus­ti­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>• Cer­tain key po­si­tions, like hu­man re­source head, op­er­a­tions head and com­pli­ance roles, should be held only by lo­cals (un­less ex­cep­tion­ally jus­ti­fied). Where for­eign ex­per­tise is needed, there should be clear tran­si­tion plans to train Sin­ga­pore­ans to as­sume the said re­spon­si­bil­i­ties in the com­ing years.</p>
    <p>The fi­nan­cial sec­tor is an im­por­tant one for Sin­ga­pore but we need to con­stantly train, up­grade and pro­tect these jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans, while con­cur­rently wel­com­ing for­eign in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>It has been com­mon mar­ket knowl­edge that cer­tain big, long es­tab­lished for­eign banks have been sidelin­ing</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean tal­ent in favour of for­eign hires, and I strongly urge the au­thor­i­ties to more closely scru­ti­nise the sit­u­a­tion in our fi­nance in­dus­try. Raymond Koh Bock Swi</p>
