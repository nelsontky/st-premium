    <p>With 15 peo­ple liv­ing un­der one roof in a West Coast ter­raced house, the last few months have been a flurry of hand wash­ing and safe dis­tanc­ing for teacher Darshini Radha Kr­ish­nan and her ex­tended fam­ily.</p>
    <p>With Deep­avali ap­proach­ing, Ms Darshini, 37, and her fam­ily – which in­cludes her hus­band Thamil Sel­van V.T Govinthara­ju, 45, and their three chil­dren aged be­tween four and 10 – thought long and hard about ways to cel­e­brate the fes­ti­val with Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions in place.</p>
    <p>Ms Darshini, who teaches at Na­tional Ju­nior Col­lege, said while some cus­toms have been dis­rupted this year, the spirit of the fes­ti­val re­mains un­changed.</p>
    <p>She said: “We have been par­tic­u­lar about not scal­ing down on cel­e­bra­tions this year.</p>
    <p>“The dec­o­ra­tions are still up, the good­ies and snacks have been pre­pared and the chil­dren got in­volved in the prepa­ra­tions as usual. It was im­por­tant for us that the kids know the sig­nif­i­cance of Deep­avali day.”</p>
    <p>Ms Darshini and her fam­ily share the home with her sis­ter Shan­thini Radha Kr­ish­nan, 39, a teacher at Lian­hua Pri­mary School, her hus­band, 49, and their two chil­dren aged 12 and nine.</p>
    <p>The sis­ters started liv­ing to­gether af­ter Ms Shan­thini moved in nine years ago. Their par­ents, two broth­ers, a grand­uncle and a do­mes­tic helper also live with them.</p>
    <p>In the weeks lead­ing up to Deep­avali, ev­ery­one pitched in to help pre­pare for the big day – mak­ing tra­di­tional fes­tive snacks, clean­ing and dec­o­rat­ing the house, and buy­ing new clothes, said Ms Darshini.</p>
    <p>To­day, ev­ery­one will of­fer prayers at the fam­ily shrine in the house, and en­ter­tain close rel­a­tives through­out the day. All vis­i­tors have been told to stick to groups of five, in line with safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, Ms Darshini said.</p>
    <p>For such a large fam­ily, the cir­cuit breaker and the days that fol­lowed were a chal­leng­ing time, but ev­ery­one re­mem­bered to wear a mask when they needed to, and made sure they took a shower af­ter com­ing home from work or school, among other things.</p>
    <p>Se­niors in the fam­ily took care to stay home, when­ever pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Ms Darshini said: “Ev­ery­one has been fully sup­port­ive of what­ever mea­sures we have taken at home. Adults took par­tic­u­lar care of their health, so they were pro­tected and the chil­dren were pro­tected too.”</p>
    <p>De­spite all the ex­tra pre­cau­tions and safety mea­sures they had to take, Ms Shan­thini said the fam­ily was grate­ful not to be liv­ing in iso­la­tion. She said: “It was re­ally a gift be­cause the chil­dren cel­e­brated birthdays dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, and while it was dif­fi­cult to get a cake, ev­ery­body worked to­gether to keep the kids happy.”</p>
    <p>And in some ways, there were pos­i­tive as­pects to the pan­demic, said Ms Darshini. Be­fore Covid-19 struck, on most days she was able to catch only a glimpse of most of the fam­ily mem­bers, as ev­ery­one went about their busy lives.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, how­ever, the fam­ily got the chance to spend some qual­ity time to­gether.</p>
    <p>Ms Darshini said: “We did our best to keep the kids en­ter­tained and keep their spir­its up be­cause they were quite wor­ried about Covid-19 based on what they had heard in school. We tried to live life as nor­mally as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>For Deep­avali, the sis­ters went to Lit­tle In­dia to pick up fes­tive goods, and got tra­di­tional clothes from a home-based ven­dor for the chil­dren, in­stead of trawl­ing the stores for fes­tive out­fits.</p>
    <p>For tra­di­tional henna de­signs, they hired a henna artist to come to their home, in­stead of brav­ing the crowds in Seran­goon Road.</p>
    <p>Ms Darshini said ev­ery­one in her fam­ily is wait­ing for the day when they can go back to cel­e­brat­ing Deep­avali with all their fam­ily and friends, to­gether in one place at the same time.</p>
    <p>She said: “Deep­avali is about shar­ing our cul­ture with friends, peo­ple who are not ac­quainted with our cul­ture, and of course, our loved ones. We hope ev­ery­thing gets bet­ter so that we can all re­turn to the way it used to be.”</p>
