    <p>Hara­juku is renowned as Tokyo’s mecca for out­landish youth cul­ture, but over in the city’s north-west is a dis­trict called Sug­amo that has come to be af­fec­tion­ately known as “Hara­juku for Grand­mas”.</p>
    <p>The la­bel has stuck since 1987, when it was first given in a news story, but res­i­dents ad­mit that Sug­amo, lo­cated two stops away from busy commuter hub Ike­bukuro, is strug­gling to repli­cate its heady past in the late 1980s and 1990s, when as many as 100,000 peo­ple would throng it on fes­ti­val days.</p>
    <p>The Sug­amo Ji­zodori Shop­ping Street – piv­otal dur­ing the Edo era (1603-1868) as a pit stop on the route con­nect­ing Edo (now Tokyo) to the an­cient cap­i­tal of Ky­oto – is home to the Ko­ganji Tem­ple, which holds a fes­ti­val to cel­e­brate a de­ity that is said to heal ail­ments.</p>
    <p>“The re­sem­blance to Hara­juku was un­canny,” Mr Shi­geo Kizaki, 72, di­rec­tor of the shop­ping street’s pro­mo­tion as­so­ci­a­tion, told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>He added: “It used to be so crowded that vis­i­tors, with barely any room to move, would walk shoul­der to shoul­der, with a row of shops on each side.”</p>
    <p>Sug­amo’s de­cline, how­ever, be­gan years ago, well be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic, which has ren­dered it so­cially ir­re­spon­si­ble – if not im­pos­si­ble in Ja­pan – to hold fes­ti­vals on their usual scale.</p>
    <p>Mr Tetsu Kobayashi, 52, third­gen­er­a­tion owner of an um­brella busi­ness and a life­long res­i­dent in Sug­amo, rem­i­nisced about how se­nior cit­i­zens used to visit wear­ing ki­monos of flashy colours. Now, about 15,000 peo­ple visit the street on a good day, he said.</p>
    <p>What has hap­pened in Sug­amo is a mi­cro­cosm of the chal­lenges faced by ru­ral re­gions across Ja­pan, which are find­ing it hard to sus­tain tra­di­tional fes­ti­vals given their rapidly de­clin­ing pop­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Iron­i­cally, in an age­ing so­ci­ety, Sug­amo is strug­gling to re­main rel­e­vant to the very de­mo­graphic that it was once at­trac­tive to.</p>
    <p>Mr Kizaki, who runs a busi­ness sell­ing bags dat­ing to 1907, said one rea­son for Sug­amo’s de­cline was the chang­ing com­plex­ion of the</p>
    <p>shop­ping street – one that he fears will be has­tened by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The 800m shop­ping street was once full of decades-old mom-and­pop busi­nesses sell­ing tra­di­tional items at mod­est prices, he said, lament­ing that these now form less</p>
    <p>than half of the 200 or so shops.</p>
    <p>But fam­ily busi­nesses have been clos­ing amid a strug­gle to find suc­ces­sors, a trend wors­ened by Covid-19 that counts among its vic­tims a Chi­nese restau­rant known as Sug­amo-en which closed in June af­ter more than 90 years of his­tory.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing their place are run-of-themill out­fits like Tully’s Cof­fee and bub­ble tea shops, pop­u­lar among youth, Mr Kizaki noted.</p>
    <p>A visi­tor in her 80s, who gave her name as Ms Miyashita, said that the new shops were a dou­ble-edged sword: While they are good for draw­ing youth, they hurt the nos­tal­gic Edo-era at­mos­phere.</p>
    <p>Mr Kizaki said his busi­ness is hang­ing on by a thread, with sales hav­ing plunged 90 per cent in the last quar­ter. Mr Kobayashi, mean­while, is un­sure if his un­der­grad­u­ate son, who is ma­jor­ing in for­eign pol­icy, will take over.</p>
    <p>But Sug­amo can take heart in peo­ple like Mr Yuki Shio­bara, 37, a mu­sic grad­u­ate who took over his fam­ily busi­ness sell­ing tea, Ya­mane-en, six years ago. He be­lieves there is plenty of po­ten­tial for the shop­ping street to thrive, with bet­ter mar­ket­ing and ef­forts to pro­tect the friendly Edo-era at­mos­phere.</p>
    <p>“It is unique not only to Ja­pan, but also to the world, to have a street so ded­i­cated to se­nior cit­i­zens,” he said, not­ing one pos­i­tive change to wel­come the elderly: Un­like much of Tokyo, the street is bar­rier-free.</p>
