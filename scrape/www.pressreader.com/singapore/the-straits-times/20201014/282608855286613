    <p>GAL GADOT TO PLAY CLEOPA­TRA: Is­raeli ac­tress Gal Gadot (right) has con­firmed on so­cial me­dia that she will be play­ing Cleopa­tra, the fa­mous queen of Egypt, af­ter this was first re­ported by en­ter­tain­ment news web­site Dead­line on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The Won­der Woman (2017) ac­tress wrote: “As you might have heard, I teamed up with Patty Jenk­ins and Laeta Kalo­gridis to bring the story of Cleopa­tra, Queen of Egypt, to the big screen in a way she’s never been seen be­fore.</p>
    <p>“To tell her story for the first time through women’s eyes, both be­hind and in front of the cam­era. And we are es­pe­cially thrilled to be an­nounc­ing this on In­ter­na­tional Day of the Girl.</p>
    <p>“We hope women and girls all around the world, who as­pire to tell sto­ries, will never give up on their dreams and will make their voices heard, by and for other women.”</p>
    <p>Gadot, 35, has al­ready worked with direc­tor Jenk­ins, 49, on the Won­der Woman movie and its se­quel Won­der Woman 1984, which is sched­uled to be re­leased in De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Kalo­gridis has co-writ­ten the screen­play for movies such as Ter­mi­na­tor Genisys (2015) and Alita: Bat­tle An­gel (2019).</p>
    <p>The role of Cleopa­tra has been por­trayed by sev­eral ac­tresses in the past, with the most no­table be­ing late ac­tress El­iz­a­beth Tay­lor in the movie Cleopa­tra (1963), which won four awards, in­clud­ing Best Cin­e­matog­ra­phy and Best Cos­tume De­sign, at the Os­cars in 1964.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to cast Gadot has not gone down well with some crit­ics.</p>
    <p>They said Cleopa­tra should be played by an ac­tress of Arab or African ori­gin, al­though oth­ers pointed out that the Egyp­tian queen was ac­tu­ally of Greek de­scent.</p>
