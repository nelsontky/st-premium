    <p>While ath­lete rep­re­sen­ta­tion in Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional sports as­so­ci­a­tions is low, at 20 per cent, as­sis­tant sports ed­i­tor Ro­hit Bri­j­nath says that com­peti­tors need to earn that right. They must be proac­tive, speak out and fight in­tel­li­gent bat­tles.</p>
    <p>If there’s one thing ath­letes are pro­grammed to do it’s fight. They bring fo­cus to hot days and per­sis­tence to hard days and chan­nel their re­solve into some­thing mean­ing­ful. Noth­ing is given, every­thing is earned, and that’s ex­actly the at­ti­tude which ath­letes need if they want a vote and a say in their fed­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials like power about as much as ath­letes like podi­ums and like every­thing else in sport this is a turf war. In the old days they’d say that ath­letes be­longed on the field and of­fi­cials in the board­room, but some ideas need to be tossed in the bin. Even the cau­tious</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC) be­lieves the think­ing-talk­ing ath­lete is a swell idea.</p>
    <p>Ath­letes should be lis­tened to sim­ply be­cause they’re the rea­son we’re all here. And if some fed­er­a­tions aren’t go­ing to give them a seat at the big table, they have to seize it. They have to con­struct ar­gu­ments so per­sua­sive and speak out with a con­vic­tion so pure that they can’t be ig­nored.</p>
    <p>My col­league wrote re­cently that 13 of 64 na­tional sports as­so­ci­a­tions (NSAs) have some sort of ath­lete rep­re­sen­ta­tion. That’s 20 per cent and unim­pres­sive. Only in three NSAs are ath­letes in­volved in de­ci­sion mak­ing. That’s 4.6 per cent and a fail­ing mark. Slow and steady is one thing, this is slug­gish.</p>
    <p>Now the ath­let­ics fed­er­a­tion, which one day will make news which will make us ad­mire it, wishes to take away the vote given to the ath­letes’ com­mis­sion. Is it the rep­re­sen­ta­tive’s man­ner it does not care for or the con­trari­ness of his ideas? As they do in sport, the of­fi­cials should lay it all out there.</p>
    <p>Ath­letes aren’t saints with sweaty ha­los but can be self-serv­ing ego­tists. They can be lit­tle-pic­ture folk, fo­cused on in­di­vid­ual goals, given to win­ning not deal-mak­ing, bril­liant when per­form­ing for them­selves but hes­i­tant de­baters at a table. This de­scrip­tion, by the way, wasn’t given to me by an of­fi­cial but by an ath­lete.</p>
    <p>He was trans­par­ent and hon­est and so were the oth­ers I spoke to. The best ath­letes don’t flinch from the truth be­cause it’s the only way to get bet­ter. Th­ese ath­letes were clear-eyed, non-con­fronta­tional and wise, all the virtues a fed­er­a­tion could use in its quest to ex­cel.</p>
    <p>One told me “peo­ple run­ning a sport don’t al­ways un­der­stand it”. An­other in­sisted “we have to be able to sit with a com­mit­tee and hear their plans and voice our con­cerns”. A third stated that of­fi­cials don’t know what’s hap­pen­ing in an ath­lete’s mind. If</p>
    <p>Ath­letes have a view of sport no one else does be­cause they see it from within. They’re the bits in­side a ma­chine, the ag­grieved party when train­ing plans go awry, the ones who know if a coach is ef­fi­cient, the peo­ple whose lives are af­fected by stuff no one else con­sid­ers.</p>
    <p>fed­er­a­tions utilise every re­source – from mar­ket­ing to coach­ing – to be bet­ter, then why aren’t they tap­ping the ex­per­tise of ath­letes?</p>
    <p>Ath­letes have a view of sport no one else does be­cause they see it from within. They’re the bits in­side a ma­chine, the ag­grieved party when train­ing plans go awry, the ones who know if a coach is ef­fi­cient, the peo­ple whose lives are af­fected by stuff no one else even con­sid­ers. Like break­fast tim­ings.</p>
    <p>Ab­hi­nav Bin­dra, the In­dian shooter who is cur­rently on the IOC’s ath­letes’ com­mis­sion, was once the chair­man of the In­ter­na­tional Shoot­ing Sport Fed­er­a­tion ath­letes com­mit­tee. On Sun­day, in pass­ing, he told me the tale of an event from years ago.</p>
    <p>The com­pe­ti­tion started rather early and when the shoot­ers had to leave the ho­tel, the break­fast room hadn’t opened. It’s the sort of cru­cial de­tail only an ath­lete might no­tice and want to ad­dress.</p>
    <p>Bin­dra is a fu­ture-think­ing fel­low who be­lieves, as some ath­letes do, that they owe their sport an ed­u­cated opin­ion. His dis­cus­sions with fel­low ath­letes and of­fi­cials have in­volved life af­ter sport, rule-mak­ing, anti-dop­ing, gen­der equal­ity, rank­ing points and mak­ing events spectator friendly.</p>
    <p>Th­ese are rou­tine sub­jects, no doubt of­ten dis­cussed in Sin­ga­pore fed­er­a­tions, but they de­serve an ath­lete’s unique view. A cur­rent cri­sis in sport, for in­stance, is men­tal well-be­ing and only stranded ath­letes, watch­ing their fu­ture tick idly away, can bring to the table the fears of their tribe.</p>
    <p>But wait­ing for of­fi­cials to make room at the table could take a while, so ath­letes need to be pro-ac­tive. They need to learn how their sport is run and flex their opin­ions. If ath­letes think an is­sue de­serves to be dis­cussed, they should form a group, band to­gether, back each other, list ideas and find an ar­tic­u­late leader to speak for them. Even­tu­ally they will be heard.</p>
    <p>Noth­ing is won solely through so­cial me­dia and so­lu­tions al­ways work bet­ter than out­rage. The best bat­tles are waged in­tel­li­gently. So ath­letes should take ad­vice from Mark Chay (chair of the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Olympic Coun­cil’s ath­letes’ com­mis­sion), write to Sport Sin­ga­pore, badger their fed­er­a­tion, pen opin­ion pieces in news­pa­pers, start a ver­sion of The Play­ers’ Tribune, go on ra­dio and highlight is­sues. If no one’s lis­ten­ing to them on se­lec­tion or sex­ual ha­rass­ment, then they need to raise their voice.</p>
    <p>No vote, for any­thing, was ever won with­out courage.</p>
