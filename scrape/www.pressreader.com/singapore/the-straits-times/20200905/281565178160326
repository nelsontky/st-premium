    <p>To un­der­stand the United States’ present po­lit­i­cal strug­gles, both do­mes­tic and for­eign, it pays to look at the un­der­ly­ing forces shap­ing Amer­i­can so­ci­ety, says Dr Adam Garfin­kle, found­ing edi­tor of The Amer­i­can In­ter­est.</p>
    <p>Oc­ca­sion­ally, some­one ex­presses a thought whose gen­eral util­ity far out­dis­tances the pur­poses of its in­ven­tion. So with the fa­mous re­mark of an Ital­ian com­mu­nist nearly a cen­tury ago: “The cri­sis con­sists pre­cisely in the fact that the old is dy­ing and the new can­not be born.” In this in­ter­reg­num, An­to­nio Gram­sci added, “a great va­ri­ety of mor­bid symp­toms ap­pears”.</p>
    <p>Gram­sci likely would not ap­prove of my ap­pro­pri­at­ing his re­mark about Europe’s civil­i­sa­tional or­der to de­scribe the plight of US grand strat­egy, but it fits the case too well to ig­nore. How so?</p>
    <p>To re­state the main mes­sage of ear­lier analy­ses, the post-World War II US grand strat­egy is dead, not by fail­ure or de­lib­er­a­tive re­jec­tion, but by suc­cess and sub­se­quent ina­ni­tion.</p>
    <p>That grand strat­egy has called for the United States, helped by an ar­ray of will­ing part­ners, to pro­vide com­mon se­cu­rity goods to the world in or­der to pre­vent the rise of an il­lib­eral hege­mon in either penin­su­lar Europe or East Asia, and thus pre­vent yet an­other ma­jor 20th-cen­tury war. It has in­volved the for­ward de­ploy­ment of US forces to sup­press desta­bil­is­ing re­gional se­cu­rity com­pe­ti­tions that would-be hege­mons could lever­age to ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>This grand strat­egy is now dead for es­sen­tially four ex­trin­sic, and one in­trin­sic, rea­sons.</p>
    <p>First, the an­i­mat­ing fear that brought it into be­ing in its post-war form – ag­gres­sive Soviet com­mu­nism – is no more, and no near-equiv­a­lent sub­sti­tute has arisen in its stead: nei­ther apoc­a­lyp­ti­cal Is­lamist ter­ror­ism nor, yet, a richer, stronger, and dif­fer­ently ori­ented China.</p>
    <p>It’s dead, se­cond, be­cause the key US-led al­liance bloc in Europe has since 1991 lost its lead­er­ship, col­lec­tive verve and, in its ex­panded post-Cold War dis­pen­sa­tion, most of its philo­soph­i­cal rai­son de­tre; the US Cold War-era al­liance struc­ture in Asia, mean­while, al­ways less in­ter­nally in­te­grated and cul­tur­ally res­o­nant than in Europe, was never up to the evolv­ing chal­lenge that’s China to­day.</p>
    <p>It’s dead, third, be­cause the strat­egy’s suc­cess has en­abled the world to change. The rise of non-West­ern so­cio-eco­nomic suc­cess sto­ries on the crest of the US-wrought open in­ter­na­tional eco­nomic or­der has given de­vel­op­ing states more mod­els of emu­la­tion, sources of suc­cour, and hence ways to hedge diplo­matic bets.</p>
    <p>And fourth, the old state-cen­tric or­der has been giv­ing way to myr­iad di­verse trans- and sub­na­tional dy­nam­ics for which the lat­ter-day pol­icy im­ple­menters lack vi­able in­tel­lec­tual or in­sti­tu­tional pur­chase.</p>
    <p>De­spite these ex­trin­sic changes, the old strat­egy sleep­walks along out of habit, oc­ca­sion­ally lo­cat­ing new but weak ra­tio­nales to main­tain a pulse. But no heart or spirit an­i­mates it, such that Amer­i­can lead­ers have long since ceased think­ing about it or jus­ti­fy­ing it to the na­tion.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, a new strat­egy can­not be born be­cause the cur­rent ad­min­is­tra­tion can­not think sys­tem­at­i­cally and a Bi­den-Har­ris ad­min­is­tra­tion, should it be sworn in on Jan 20, ap­pears bent op­ti­misti­cally on res­ur­rect­ing a tin­kered-with form of the old strat­egy de­spite the world hav­ing moved on.</p>
    <p>Alas, its at­tempt to not boldly go where Amer­ica has al­ready been be­fore is li­able to pro­duce mor­bid geopo­lit­i­cal symp­toms. How­ever grudg­ingly, Gram­sci’s hat must tip.</p>
    <p>THE IN­WARD TURN</p>
    <p>But the more pro­found rea­son the old grand strat­egy is gone is the in­trin­sic one. Amer­ica, “the na­tion with the soul of a church”, as G.K. Ch­ester­ton re­marked, is in an­other of its self-dep­re­ca­tory moods. It can­not sus­tain for it­self a con­struc­tive, ac­tive in­ter­na­tional role un­less its in­ner virtue, its vaunted “ex­cep­tion­al­ism”, lights its way into the wider world. Self-doubt al­ways turns Amer­ica in­ward to atone and to mend, but why this in­ward turn­ing now?</p>
    <p>Why, the English say, is a crooked let­ter that can­not be made straight, which is a sly way of ob­serv­ing that any sim­ple an­swer begs an­other “why” ques­tion – tur­tles all the way down, in other words. Why then, we ask?</p>
    <p>Be­cause no ex­cep­tion­al­ist lan­guage has come from the White House for at least a dozen years. For­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama re­fused to af­firm it and Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has atavis­ti­cally dis­par­aged it. When Amer­ica’s lead­ers ab­jure telling the sto­ries that in­spire and unite the peo­ple so that they may project them­selves abroad to a pur­pose, they man­i­fest the broader elite hav­ing aban­doned myth main­te­nance now for decades.</p>
    <p>But why have they?</p>
    <p>Be­cause Amer­i­cans are in­creas­ingly so bit­terly di­vided that no com­mon pur­pose for liv­ing to­gether in a sin­gle po­lit­i­cal com­mu­nity has been ev­i­dent for years. Mr Obama tried to fi­nesse the prob­lem; Mr Trump ex­ac­er­bates it so as to profit po­lit­i­cally from it.</p>
    <p>This is crit­i­cal, for as an im­mi­grant na­tion with a more ab­stract and hence frag­ile civic form of na­tion­al­ism than is true of blood­line forms, Amer­ica’s sense of unity has al­ways been for­ward look­ing, al­ways been about what we will build to­gether at the next fron­tier. No such spirit is ev­i­dent, and no such fron­tier in­spires the na­tion amid a ris­ing ca­coph­ony of ac­cu­sa­tions of bad faith.</p>
    <p>But why?</p>
    <p>SOME POP­U­LAR BUT WEAK AN­SWERS</p>
    <p>It’s not be­cause of eco­nomic woes:</p>
    <p>We can no longer af­ford it for all the ex­pen­sive prob­lems we must fix at home. Many be­lieve that, but this is wrong: Plenty of money to sup­port a global strat­egy is at hand. The US does not have age­ing in­fra­struc­ture, poor schools and over-ex­pen­sive and un­der­per­form­ing health­care be­cause of its troops in Ger­many or the Sev­enth Fleet float­ing about in the Pa­cific Ocean. What these prob­lems sig­nal is in­sti­tu­tional de­cay that comes from a lack of pub­lic-minded will and cre­ativ­ity, not a lack of money.</p>
    <p>And it’s not be­cause “end­less wars” have caused in­ter­na­tion­al­ism fa­tigue. Those wars are not end­less, nor have they been par­tic­u­larly costly in Amer­i­can lives. It is rather that they have either not been clearly won (Afghanista­n and Iraq) or were mis­con­ceived (Libya and also per­haps Iraq), and that lead­ers of both par­ties have failed to ar­tic­u­late their pur­poses in ways that most Amer­i­cans have found both cred­i­ble and per­sua­sive. Amer­i­cans would have fought World War II for 14 in­stead of four years had it been nec­es­sary be­cause they un­der­stood the moral and prac­ti­cal stakes in­volved. It is the generic fail­ure of lead­er­ship, not the wars as such, that has stoked for­eign pol­icy fa­tigue.</p>
    <p>WHAT’S NEW</p>
    <p>Amer­ica to­day is deep in the dol­drums for other, deeper rea­sons, and since for­eign pol­icy is a pro­jec­tion of do­mes­tic pol­i­tics and cul­ture, that af­fects a sys­tem as por­ous and noisy as that of the US. We’ve been there be­fore, how­ever, as dur­ing the Carter “malaise” pe­riod of the late 70s. Amer­ica is also pro­duc­ing un­usu­ally large lava flows of ir­ra­tional­ity, but that isn’t new either. In 1968 alone, a po­lice riot marred the Demo­cratic Na­tional Con­ven­tion in Chicago, Alabama Gover­nor Ge­orge Wal­lace ran an out­right seg­re­ga­tion­ist pres­i­den­tial cam­paign and as­sas­si­na­tions felled Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr, catalysing a level of do­mes­tic un­rest that dwarfs re­cent se­que­lae.</p>
    <p>So we must ask what is dif­fer­ent, not about the kinds of things go­ing on but rather about the con­text into which they are fall­ing. And here, in sum, is the real an­swer to “why”: Amer­ica has be­come an all-pur­pose im­mod­er­a­tion ma­chine. Drop any is­sue into the froth­ing broth of Amer­ica’s cur­rent ma­nia, whether sear­ing re­minders of racial fric­tion or Covid-19 or Sino-US ri­valry or im­mi­gra­tion or gun con­trol pro­pos­als, and any prag­matic cen­tre will quickly boil away, leav­ing only clash­ing ide­o­log­i­cal ex­tremes pro­pelled by a gal­lop­ing, fan­tasy-in­flected im­pa­tience.</p>
    <p>But… why?</p>
    <p>It’s not sim­ple. Seven pop­u­lar ar­gu­ments claim­ing to be an­swers ac­tu­ally con­sti­tute man­i­fes­ta­tions of deeper dys­func­tion: a plu­to­cra­tised cap­i­tal­ism that abets ex­ces­sive in­equal­ity; a post-elite mer­i­toc­racy run amok within it; crude pop­ulism risen against it; po­lar­i­sa­tion on ac­count of it; in­sti­tu­tional mal­function partly in­de­pen­dent of it and partly not; so­cial trust haem­or­rhag­ing from sev­eral sources; and a tech­no­log­i­cal tsunami warp­ing and desta­bil­is­ing ev­ery­thing it touches.</p>
    <p>All seven ar­gu­ments are valid, but com­bin­ing them and link­ing them to the im­mod­er­a­tion ma­chine Amer­ica has be­come re­quires three other en­abling un­der-tur­tles, so to speak. These are easy to miss see­ing be­cause they tend to dis­ap­pear seam­lessly into our ex­pe­ri­ence over time.</p>
    <p>The first is un­prece­dented ma­te­rial af­flu­ence, which has made pos­si­ble a plethora of tech­nol­ogy-pro­pelled fan­tasy spec­ta­cle en­ter­tain­ment. Mass con­sump­tion of such fare has shifted the per­cep­tual frame of</p>
    <p>Amer­i­cans pol­i­tics for many, so that it seems akin to their favourite re­al­ity TV shows. Sub­stance and se­ri­ous­ness have gone miss­ing; what re­mains is merely game-like.</p>
    <p>The se­cond is the afore­men­tioned de­ferred myth main­te­nance: Amer­i­can elites no longer tell the sto­ries of ex­cep­tion­al­ist ori­gins and credit to the founders that link Amer­i­can po­lit­i­cal in­sti­tu­tions to the En­light­en­ment prin­ci­ples to which they owe their ex­is­tence. At the same time, a cor­ro­sive anti-En­light­en­ment nar­ra­tive is pour­ing into the vac­uum from the sa­lon left in the form of an in­stru­men­talised, post­mod­ernist ver­sion of “crit­i­cal the­ory” that stylises his­tory as a bat­ter­ing ram and aimed to un­der­mine those prin­ci­ples.</p>
    <p>And the third is the tech­nol­ogy-pro­pelled ero­sion of deep lit­er­acy. The way our brains are be­ing wired via the cy­ber­netic revo­lu­tion, em­bod­ied in the gadgets with which we have so blithely sur­rounded our­selves, is chang­ing in not nec­es­sar­ily be­nign ways. The dig­i­tal dilemma is real; Faus­tus would un­der­stand.</p>
    <p>Deep lit­er­acy ero­sion con­trib­utes to our tak­ing our af­flu­ence for granted, with con­se­quences not un­like those af­flict­ing heirs who in­herit for­tunes but not the ex­pe­ri­ence or char­ac­ter to man­age them well. It also priv­i­leges images and emo­tions over lan­guage and rea­son, so makes even more se­duc­tive the at­trac­tions of es­capist fan­tasy spec­ta­cle whose sim­ple-minded plots con­trib­ute to the rise of a con­spir­acy the­ory men­tal­ity. Note: QAnon.</p>
    <p>In­deed, via so­cial me­dia and other in­stru­men­tal­i­ties, deep lit­er­acy ero­sion has over­turned the busi­ness mod­els and modal­i­ties of me­dia, hol­low­ing out any com­mon sense about what is news and even what is a fact. That vac­uum en­cour­ages the con­tend­ing ex­tremes to steal the show.</p>
    <p>Taken to­gether, these sources driv­ing the im­mod­er­a­tion ma­chine are shat­ter­ing the guard rails that have long kept Amer­i­cans’ vast en­er­gies and en­thu­si­asms from over­flow­ing their banks. Hence the novel and apparently for­mi­da­ble dif­fi­cul­ties of Amer­ica’s lead­ers think­ing clearly about na­tional se­cu­rity strat­egy, or, apparently, much else.</p>
    <p>We in the US are in real trou­ble. What peo­ple across the world are see­ing is not nor­mal – not en­tirely un­prece­dented his­tor­i­cally but un­prece­dented in its crit­i­cal con­text. As a re­sult, we may fail to hold an even half­way nor­mal elec­tion in Novem­ber, or have a nor­mal demo­cratic tran­si­tion in Jan­uary.</p>
