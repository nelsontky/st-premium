    <p>A decade ago, Pung­gol was known mainly for its lalang fields and a lone tree atop a small hill. Even fur­ther back, Pung­gol was a ru­ral vil­lage called Kam­pung Pung­gol. But to­day’s Pung­gol is a far cry from these be­gin­nings.</p>
    <p>A decade ago, Pung­gol was known mainly for its lalang fields and a lone tree atop a small hill – since re­moved – that graced many In­sta­gram photos.</p>
    <p>Even fur­ther back, Pung­gol was called Kam­pung Pung­gol, a ru­ral vil­lage known for fish­ing, poul­try and pig farm­ing, as well as its seafood restau­rants and boat­ing fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>To­day’s Pung­gol is a far cry from those be­gin­nings, al­though el­e­ments of its her­itage and his­tory have been in­cor­po­rated into the town plan­ning.</p>
    <p>While the “Pung­gol lone tree” that was the town’s most recog­nis­able land­mark is long gone, in its place is Pung­gol Wa­ter­way, a 4.2km-long man-made wa­ter­way that me­an­ders through the town. A 10m-wide land­scaped prom­e­nade run­ning along both banks of the wa­ter­way pro­vides a space for recre­ation and re­lax­ation for res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>The town in north-east Sin­ga­pore, one of the Hous­ing Board’s youngest towns, is home to some 187,800 res­i­dents liv­ing in 49,909</p>
    <p>HDB flats. It is not by chance that Pung­gol has be­come the thriv­ing town it is to­day.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the HDB spelt out how Pung­gol was mas­ter­planned into a “wa­ter­front town of the 21st cen­tury”. The vi­sion was first un­veiled by Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong in his 2007 Na­tional Day Rally.</p>
    <p>A Pung­gol town guide, which will be out at the end of this year, chron­i­cles the town’s vi­sion and dis­tinc­tive iden­tity to help fu­ture plan­ners and agen­cies unify its de­vel­op­ments as it evolves.</p>
    <p>Two other town de­sign guides – for Pasir Ris and Ten­gah – will also be ready by the end of this year.</p>
    <p>The first town de­sign guide, for Wood­lands, was launched by the HDB in 2018, and there are plans to</p>
    <p>re­lease such man­u­als for each of its 24 towns.</p>
    <p>Each town is planned on three scales: town, neigh­bour­hood and precinct.</p>
    <p>The bird’s-eye-view town layer pro­vides the over­all theme, con­cept and vi­sion for the town, such as its land­marks and how cy­cling paths are laid out.</p>
    <p>The neigh­bour­hood – or district – layer sets out sub-themes and con­cepts based on the her­itage and char­ac­ter of each area.</p>
    <p>The precinct layer, a ground-level guide, de­tails the de­sign of in­di­vid­ual projects such as the type of play­grounds or the type of street fur­ni­ture to be in­stalled.</p>
    <p>At the town level, Pung­gol was planned and de­signed based on the over­all theme of “Wa­ter and Na­ture”, draw­ing in­spi­ra­tion from its wa­ter­front lo­ca­tion and lush green­ery.</p>
    <p>The town is planned with 11 hous­ing dis­tricts, each with its own dis­tinc­tive char­ac­ter. Each district is fur­ther split into es­tates of about 2,000 to 3,000 flats to cre­ate small and in­ti­mate com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Cy­cling paths are built in tan­dem with new roads, while ex­ist­ing roads are retro­fit­ted with cy­cling paths where fea­si­ble to en­hance res­i­dents’ first- and last-mile con­nec­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>At the neigh­bour­hood level, the 11 hous­ing dis­tricts are fur­ther seg­mented into nine sub-themes that cor­re­spond to the over­all Pung­gol theme of “Wa­ter and Na­ture”.</p>
    <p>These in­clude “Ur­ban Ter­races”, “Ve­ran­dah” and “Marine” themes, picked based on the his­tor­i­cal and phys­i­cal fea­tures of dif­fer­ent ar­eas.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, within the Wa­ter­way West district, res­i­den­tial de­vel­op­ments adopt ter­rac­ing build­ing forms that step down to­wards Pung­gol Wa­ter­way and Pung­gol Reser­voir, in line with the district’s “Ur­ban Ter­races” theme.</p>
    <p>The ter­raced ef­fect al­lows the most num­ber of HDB flats to en­joy scenic views of the wa­ter­front.</p>
    <p>The sub-theme is fur­ther en­hanced on the precinct level, such as through a lay­ered roof de­sign at the drop-off porch in Wa­ter­way Cas­ca­dia, a Build-To-Or­der (BTO) project in Wa­ter­way West district.</p>
    <p>Lo­gis­tics man­ager Sam Lim, 43, who has been a res­i­dent of Pung­gol since 2012, said he still re­mem­bers the days when Pung­gol was a quiet town with few ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“When we moved into our first flat, there was a lalang field op­po­site our block and no shops were open. It was con­sid­ered quite ‘ulu’ back then, but over the years you can def­i­nitely feel that it has be­come more crowded,” he said.</p>
    <p>His fam­ily of three sold their first four-room BTO flat in Pung­gol Drive and moved to a big­ger five-room flat in Su­mang Lane two years ago. “Peo­ple ask me why I bought a flat in Pung­gol again. Why not? My fam­ily is used to this area, we have many friends liv­ing around us now and we also en­joy the fa­cil­i­ties here.”</p>
