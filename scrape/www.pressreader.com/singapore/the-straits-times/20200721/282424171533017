    <p>Bar­tender Johnny Rosle finds cock­tail in­gre­di­ents i n strange places, such as dump­sters and the re­duced-to-clear sec­tions in su­per­mar­kets.</p>
    <p>He tries to re­duce food waste by us­ing th­ese in­gre­di­ents to make un­usual drinks such as oc­to­pus-, lak­saand goat cheese-in­fused gins – af­ter he has cleaned them, of course.</p>
    <p>Mr Johnny will be shar­ing a few tricks of his trade in lo­cal bilin­gual theatre com­pany The Theatre Prac­tice’s mostly vir­tual M1 Patch! A (Live) Theatre Fes­ti­val Of Play, which started over the week­end.</p>
    <p>The third edi­tion of the fes­ti­val also of­fers pro­grammes such as an in­ter­ac­tive show that aims to rein­vent Man­darin nurs­ery rhymes and cook­ing demon­stra­tions by Sin­ga­pore­ans liv­ing over­seas.</p>
    <p>In t he fes­ti­val’s Play With... Flavours on­line ex­pe­ri­ence, par­tic­i­pants will get to sam­ple gin in­fu­sions made by Mr Johnny, who is the res­i­dent bar­tender at Ori­en­tal Elixir cock­tail bar in Haji Lane.</p>
    <p>They will also learn how to in­fuse in­gre­di­ents i n gin and make cock­tails.</p>
    <p>Mr Johnny, 25, says his job has given him a new per­spec­tive on food.</p>
    <p>“When I eat or drink some­thing, my first thought is to try and fig­ure out if this could be trans­formed into an in­fu­sion and to de­ter­mine the key flavour notes,” he says.</p>
    <p>“The idea is to play with flavour and food. Life doesn’t have to be so se­ri­ous.”</p>
    <p>The cock­tail-mak­ing ses­sion is one of three on­line ex­pe­ri­ences in the fes­ti­val’s Play With... se­ries.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants can also l earn to make be­spoke gar­ments i n a work­shop with fash­ion and cos­tume de­signer Max Tan, or ex­plore the no­tion of power through a role-play­ing game.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, fam­i­lies with chil­dren can take part in the fes­ti­val’s vir­tual live in­ter­ac­tive show se­ries, Here Comes Kaya And Roti! “Where Are Our Friends?”.</p>
    <p>Each show com­prises three episodes which in­clude sin­ga­long ses­sions, craft-mak­ing and im­pro­vi­sa­tional sto­ry­telling.</p>
    <p>The se­ries is part of The Theatre Prac­tice’s The Nurs­ery Rhymes Project, which aims to rein­vent clas­sic Man­darin nurs­ery rhymes.</p>
    <p>It will fea­ture tunes such as pop­u­lar folk songs The Lit­tle White Boat and The Coun­try Road, as well as songs from the com­pany’s orig­i­nal Chi­nese mu­si­cals.</p>
    <p>Ac­tress Ang Xiao Ting, who plays the char­ac­ter Roti, says: “I’m sure I learnt most of th­ese songs in school, but I had only im­pres­sions of them. When I started singing th­ese songs again, I re­ally en­joyed them.”</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old is also the pro­gram­mer of the M1 Patch! fes­ti­val’s On­line Re­cess Time, which con­sists of lunch par­ties hosted by Sin­ga­pore­ans liv­ing abroad in coun­tries such as Aus­tralia and the</p>
    <p>United King­dom.</p>
    <p>Be­sides tak­ing part in the on­line ac­tiv­i­ties, par­tic­i­pants can also visit the fes­ti­val’s sole phys­i­cal fea­ture, c o o p, a multi-level out­door in­stal­la­tion at The Theatre Prac­tice’s build­ing at 54 Water­loo Street.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s artis­tic di­rec­tor Kuo Jian Hong hopes the fes­ti­val will en­cour­age peo­ple to re­dis­cover play and take risks.</p>
    <p>She says: “If we are lucky, we will play our en­tire life. This is the plat­form we’ve set up – play­ful, but not for­get­ting about our craft and the artis­tic stan­dard of the work we’ve done.”</p>
