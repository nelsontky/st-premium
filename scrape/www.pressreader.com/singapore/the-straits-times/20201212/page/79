ORIGINAL COPY COPYRIGHT AND PROTECTED BY APPLICABLE LAW The rainbow-hued louvred windows that front the Old Hill Street Police Station bring to light a vibrant history.
Officially opened in 1934, it used to house the Hill Street Police Station and Barracks, serving as a stronghold from which the Singapore Police Force strategise­d ways to nullify increasing Chinese secret society activities.
The building was officially opened by G. Sturrock, Director of Public Works and Advisor of Malay States. Built at a cost of $634,263, it housed a police station with a charge room, offices and garages. It also had quarters for 140 married men, 180 single policemen, 10 sub-inspectors as well as apartments for five Asian and four European Inspectors.
In July 2001, the building was one of three national monuments conferred the Urban Redevelopm­ent Authority’s Architectu­ral Heritage Awards. The other two winners were Thian Hock Keng temple and the House of Tan Yeok Nee. Room for comfort Private apartment for sale Class 413 D03 Step right in PHOTO: GettyImage­s
