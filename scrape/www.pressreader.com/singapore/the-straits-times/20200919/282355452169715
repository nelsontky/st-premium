    <p>Mikel Arteta said Pier­reEm­er­ick Aubameyang’s de­ci­sion to sign a new deal at Arse­nal showed the Pre­mier League club were on the same level as Euro­pean gi­ants such as Barcelona.</p>
    <p>The Gabon for­ward, 31, com­mit­ted his fu­ture to the Gun­ners for an­other three years this week af­ter months of spec­u­la­tion that he would leave for a club in the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>The deal is re­ported to be worth £250,000 (S$440,000) a week, with bonuses that could take it be­yond the £350,000-a-week con­tract of the club’s high­est earner, Me­sut Ozil.</p>
    <p>Arse­nal boss Arteta, speak­ing at his press con­fer­ence ahead of to­day’s Pre­mier League home clash against West Ham, said he was de­lighted the trans­fer saga was over.</p>
    <p>“It was a big boost be­cause I think ev­ery­body was hop­ing for Auba to stay but it was cre­at­ing some un­cer­tainty around the place, and ob­vi­ously it’s great as well to be able to fin­ish those sort of spec­u­la­tions, move on and find some more sta­bil­ity,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It was wor­ry­ing me be­cause it’s so hard to find re­place­ment strik­ers of that cal­i­bre, so I’m re­ally pleased.”</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard said it was a “joy” to work with his skip­per Aubameyang, who signed for the FA Cup hold­ers in 2018 and has scored 72 goals in 111 ap­pear­ances.</p>
    <p>“The way he trains, the way he be­haves him­self and the way he per­forms is ex­actly what I want from him so I want him to do that again con­sis­tently in the next few years,” Arteta said.</p>
    <p>The man­ager also ad­mit­ted that when he joined the club last De­cem­ber, he was not as pos­i­tive as he had been in the past few weeks that Arse­nal would keep hold of their star for­ward.</p>
    <p>“Fi­nan­cially we were in a po­si­tion that it was dif­fi­cult to get what we wanted to get,” he said. “I think Auba had his doubts as well at the time.</p>
    <p>“Things evolved in a nat­u­ral way. I had a feel­ing that the club wanted to move for­ward, I had a feel­ing that Auba wanted to stay here and we were just try­ing to glide those things to­gether and if the out­come is what we both wanted, then we’re happy.”</p>
    <p>Aubameyang had been linked with a move to Barcelona but Arteta said the deal showed Arse­nal were as big a name as the Span­ish gi­ants.</p>
    <p>“I think the big rea­son Auba is stay­ing is be­cause we have an in­cred­i­ble foot­ball team, an in­cred­i­ble club,” said Arteta, who started his ca­reer in the Barcelona youth sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“We have some fan­tas­tic peo­ple work­ing here and be­cause he feels as well how much love he’s got from the fans.”</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing Aubameyang’s new deal, the club are look­ing to bring in a new goal­keeper to com­pete with Bernd Leno af­ter the de­par­ture of Emil­iano Martinez to As­ton Villa.</p>
    <p>Ice­land in­ter­na­tional Ru­nar Alex Ru­nars­son is be­lieved to be close to join­ing.</p>
    <p>For the Lon­don derby to­day, Arteta con­firmed that David Luiz is in line to fea­ture af­ter a neck spasm kept the de­fender out of the 3-0 win at Ful­ham last week­end.</p>
