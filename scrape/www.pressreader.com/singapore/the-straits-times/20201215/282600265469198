    <p>SYD­NEY • As Covid-19 re­stric­tions blan­ket much of Europe and in­fec­tions con­tinue to climb in the United States, Aus­tralia is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing the big­gest holiday boom i n half a cen­tury af­ter vir­tu­ally elim­i­nat­ing the virus.</p>
    <p>With the in­ter­na­tional bor­der closed, globe-trot­ting Aus­tralians who nor­mally head over­seas to Aspen or Phuket at this time of the year are be­ing forced to va­ca­tion at home.</p>
    <p>It has brought a blast in do­mes­tic con­sump­tion, help­ing lift the na­tion out of re­ces­sion as Aus­tralia’s long, hot sum­mer kicks off and the pop­u­la­tion roams its vast back­yard.</p>
    <p>That spend­ing surge is set to con­tinue as house­holds that hoarded cash through­out the pan­demic hit the bi­tu­men and recre­ate the long trips that de­fined va­ca­tions in the post-war decades.</p>
    <p>Among them is Syd­neysider Brian Gib­bons, who was forced to can­cel a five-week trip back to Ire­land in April. In­stead, he spent close to A$4,000 (S$4,035) on camp­ing gear for a fam­ily holiday closer to home. “You name it, we bought it,” Mr Gib­bons said.</p>
    <p>Amid the ex­o­dus from Mel­bourne, Syd­ney and other ma­jor cities for sum­mer breaks, rental rates are soar­ing for the few beach­side holiday homes still va­cant.</p>
    <p>Re­tail­ers say sales of camper vans, ve­hi­cle ac­ces­sories, roof racks and bike car­ri­ers are boom­ing.</p>
    <p>To be sure, the closed in­ter­na­tional bor­der has robbed Aus­tralia of the dol­lars of over­seas tourists – a record 9.3 mil­lion peo­ple vis­ited in the fi­nan­cial year be­fore the coro­n­avirus broke out, gov­ern­ment data shows.</p>
    <p>But, with Aus­tralians typ­i­cally spend­ing more over­seas than in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tors spend in the na­tion, the net ben­e­fit for the do­mes­tic tourism in­dus­try could be as much as A$19 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>ROAD TRIP</p>
    <p>In a nor­mal year, re­tiree Peter Chan­dler and his wife would take two trips from Perth, Western Aus­tralia, to the north­ern hemi­sphere.</p>
    <p>In March, they had to abort a cruise off Brazil’s north­ern coast as Covid-19 started to spread world­wide. Now, Mr Chan­dler is pour­ing his holiday money into Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Two months ago, the 67-year-old spent A$37,000 on a sec­ond-hand Mit­subishi Pa­jero sport util­ity ve­hi­cle and the cou­ple are plan­ning a two-week car­a­van­ing trip through south-western Aus­tralia next month.</p>
    <p>He has no plans to travel farther than New Zealand un­til he is vac­ci­nated. “I would love to go to Bali, but there’s just no way in the</p>
    <p>world I would go near the place.”</p>
    <p>This re­di­rect­ion of tourism dol­lars is a bo­nanza for some in­vestors too.</p>
    <p>Shares of Su­per Re­tail Group, the fish­ing-and-camp­ing su­per­store owner, and Bap­cor, which runs Au­to­barn car-ac­ces­sory out­lets, have more than dou­bled since March.</p>
    <p>The stock price of ARB, which spe­cialises in equip­ment for off-road ve­hi­cles, has al­most tripled. To­gether, they have added more than A$4.4 bil­lion of mar­ket value.</p>
    <p>The scale of the boom sur­prised Bap­cor chief ex­ec­u­tive Darryl Abotomey, who said roof-rack sales have dou­bled this year and de­mand for road-trip es­sen­tials such as in­car en­ter­tain­ment sys­tems is soar­ing.</p>
    <p>He reck­ons de­mand will con­tinue for the next few years as first-timers get a taste for the road trips of yes­ter­year.</p>
    <p>“We thought we might have a good month or two, but it’s con­tin­ued,” he said. “I re­mem­ber when I was a kid, my par­ents used to chuck me in the back of the sta­tion wagon, stick the car­a­van on the back and you’d go wher­ever. That seems to be what peo­ple are start­ing to do.”</p>
    <p>SPEND­ING SPREE</p>
    <p>Mr Andy Shen, gen­eral man­ager of Mel­bourne-based on­line bi­cy­cle store Cy­cling Deal, is strug­gling to keep pace with de­mand for bikes, tools, car racks and tow­ing de­vices.</p>
    <p>“Some of the new stock has ar­rived, but it’s still not enough,” he said.</p>
    <p>Do­mes­tic travel has grad­u­ally in­creased as states and ter­ri­to­ries eased in­ter­nal bor­der re­stric­tions aimed at stop­ping the spread of the virus. And since Queens­land opened its bor­der to New South Wales and Vic­to­ria early this month, it has ex­ploded.</p>
    <p>There has been min­i­mal com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion na­tion­wide since Mel­bourne emerged from a three­month lock­down in late Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Other na­tions that have con­trolled the virus are see­ing a sim­i­lar in­crease in travel. In China, air pas­sen­ger traf­fic is al­most back to nor­mal.</p>
    <p>But the boom­ing de­mand may see some would-be hol­i­day­mak­ers dis­ap­pointed. At beaches three hours’ drive south of Syd­ney, there is al­most no holiday ac­com­mo­da­tion left.</p>
    <p>McKay’s Oys­ters, farther south in Pam­bula, is scram­bling to keep up with a 200 per cent jump in de­mand.</p>
    <p>“Nor­mally be­fore Christ­mas, we have a quiet pe­riod be­cause ev­ery­one is sav­ing up for his or her Christ­mas presents. But be­cause ev­ery­one is hav­ing a Covid-19 holiday, we’re get­ting ham­mered,” said owner John McKay, who has been run­ning his busi­ness for the past 30 years.</p>
    <p>All 63 va­ca­tion homes man­aged by Jervis Bay Rentals are booked un­til the end of next month, and nightly rates are up 30 per cent to 40 per cent, said owner Peter Atkins.</p>
    <p>Fam­i­lies are more than will­ing to spend A$10,000 a week for a home and even more for a lux­u­ri­ous prop­erty, he said. “That’s your Aspen trip­pers,” he added. “We’re flat out.”</p>
