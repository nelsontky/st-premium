    <p>For Sin­ga­pore­ans who have done well in build­ing wealth and have more than enough to last them a life­time, here is an idea on how you can make use of CPF Life.</p>
    <p>You can turn it into a gift for char­i­ties that will keep on giv­ing for as long as you live.</p>
    <p>And how much is this gift worth? De­pend­ing on your longevity, it can range from about $500,000 to close to $1 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>CPF Life is com­pul­sory for all Sin­ga­pore­ans, re­gard­less of whether they need the money or not.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, those who have mil­lions of dol­lars in sav­ings or in­vest­ments are likely to be able to en­joy a re­tire­ment in­come that is sub­stan­tially more than even the high­est CPF Life monthly pay­out of more than $2,000. But they, too, are en­ti­tled to en­joy the ben­e­fits that come with CPF. So they may want to con­sider us­ing this pay­out for a wor­thy cause.</p>
    <p>Not all char­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore are for­tu­nate enough to have reg­u­lar donors to keep sup­port­ing them, let alone one who can give more than $2,000 ev­ery month, po­ten­tially for 20 to 30 years.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a re­cent Credit Suisse re­port, there are over 200,000 mil­lion­aires here. Imag­ine if only 1 per cent of these wealthy folks, or 2,000 of them, use their CPF Life for the public good, about $5 mil­lion will go to the needy ev­ery month, or $60 mil­lion in a year.</p>
    <p>And if all of them are blessed with long life, just this group of folks would have do­nated over $2 bil­lion in their life­times, and that is just with money from CPF that they do not need.</p>
    <p>Of course, giv­ing to char­i­ties is not an act re­served for the rich – many or­di­nary Sin­ga­pore­ans are very gen­er­ous when it comes to help­ing those less for­tu­nate than them­selves.</p>
    <p>A ‘CPF TRUST’ FOR</p>
    <p>CHAR­ITY IS EASY TO SET UP</p>
    <p>Un­like a char­ity trust or foun­da­tion that would re­quire peo­ple to man­age, you can eas­ily start your own CPF Life “trust fund” with­out much ef­fort.</p>
    <p>All you need to do is to open a bank ac­count and in­struct the CPF Board to de­posit your monthly pay­out there when you reach 65.</p>
    <p>One month af­ter the first pay­out goes in, you can ap­ply for Giro pay­ments to your pre­ferred char­i­ties based on the fixed sum that you will be get­ting.</p>
    <p>That’s all you need to do. This is bet­ter than leav­ing in­struc­tions in wills to do­nate to char­i­ties as you can do it while you are still around.</p>
    <p>As both the monthly de­posit and de­duc­tion will be done au­to­mat­i­cally, this ac­count will never be empty un­til the CPF Life pay­out ends upon death.</p>
    <p>And when your ben­e­fi­cia­ries re­alise that the monthly do­na­tion from you has stopped, they will prob­a­bly say a prayer for you be­cause they will know you have gone to a bet­ter place.</p>
