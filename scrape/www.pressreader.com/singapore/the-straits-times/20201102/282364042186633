    <p>As in­vestors con­front the up­com­ing United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, we be­lieve that, in terms of mar­ket im­pact, two un­cer­tain­ties dwarf the ob­vi­ous ques­tion of who will win the White House.</p>
    <p>A SMOOTH TRAN­SI­TION OF POWER?</p>
    <p>The first ques­tion is whether there will be a smooth tran­si­tion of power. In past elec­tions, a pre­dictable process was mostly taken for granted, but we should not do so this time given mul­ti­ple red flags that Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump is pre­pared to con­test the elec­tion out­come. Th­ese in­clude his re­fusals to com­mit to ac­cept­ing the re­sults, his claims of wide­spread voter fraud and, more tellingly, his pre­dic­tion that the out­come will be de­cided by the Supreme Court.</p>
    <p>Faith in US in­sti­tu­tions and the sta­bil­ity of its demo­cratic pro­cesses play a key role in un­der­pin­ning in­vestors’ con­fi­dence in its mar­kets – and a chaotic and drawn-out con­test would re­sult in much anx­i­ety.</p>
    <p>To il­lus­trate, the last con­tested elec­tion in 2000 be­tween Mr Ge­orge W. Bush and Mr Al Gore was rel­a­tively brief – start­ing from elec­tion day on Nov 7 and last­ing till Dec 13 when Mr Gore con­ceded. This episode ended more than a month be­fore the planned in­au­gu­ra­tion of the new pres­i­dent on Jan 20, 2001; even so, we saw the S&P 500 fall more than 10 per cent over that pe­riod, while the US dol­lar de­pre­ci­ated and safe-haven gold rose in value.</p>
    <p>At the time of writ­ing, Mr Joe Bi­den’s av­er­age lead in the polls of about 3 per­cent­age points in the six bat­tle­ground states of North Carolina, Ari­zona, Florida,</p>
    <p>Penn­syl­va­nia, Wis­con­sin and Michi­gan has sig­nif­i­cantly re­duced, but not elim­i­nated, the risk of a con­tested elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Like the 2000 elec­tion, Florida is a wild card, given that Mr Bi­den’s lead there is only 1.2 per­cent­age points, which falls within the mar­gin of er­ror.</p>
    <p>On elec­tion day, the fo­cus will be on Florida, North Carolina and Ari­zona, and if Mr Bi­den builds a clear and early lead in th­ese states, then Mr Trump’s op­tions to cred­i­bly con­test the re­sult would be cur­tailed. If Mr Trump wins Florida and Ohio, how­ever, the risk of a drawn-out con­test rises pre­cip­i­tously.</p>
    <p>WILL CON­GRESS RE­MAIN IN GRID­LOCK?</p>
    <p>The se­cond ques­tion is whether the US Con­gress will re­main di­vided af­ter the elec­tions, that is, the Se­nate con­trolled by a Repub­li­can ma­jor­ity and the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives by the Democrats. If grid­lock per­sists, then never mind who wins the pres­i­dency – both Mr Bi­den and Mr Trump will find it dif­fi­cult to ex­pand gov­ern­ment spend­ing or im­ple­ment their re­spec­tive agen­das to boost growth.</p>
    <p>Since the 2018 midterm elec­tion when the House flipped to a Demo­cratic ma­jor­ity, Mr Trump has strug­gled to bridge the gulf be­tween the two par­ties; and his sur­pris­ing fail­ure to pass a new pan­demic re­lief pack­age in the fourth quar­ter of this year that is so crit­i­cal to sus­tain­ing the nas­cent US re­cov­ery re­flects the neg­a­tive ef­fects of the par­ti­san­ship in Wash­ing­ton to­day.</p>
    <p>SCOPE FOR NEAR-TERM TUR­BU­LENCE</p>
    <p>Th­ese two elec­tion-re­lated risks sig­nal scope for near-term tur­bu­lence for mar­kets – es­pe­cially if we also take into ac­count the neg­a­tive im­pact of new Covid-19 surges in the US and Europe as we head into the win­ter sea­son be­fore the wide­spread avail­abil­ity of vac­cines and the wan­ing of the sup­port­ive ef­fects of US fis­cal stim­u­lus over the next few months be­fore a new pack­age is de­liv­ered, likely in the first quar­ter of next year.</p>

While elec&#xAD;tion un&#xAD;cer&#xAD;tain&#xAD;ties may loom large for now, polls sug&#xAD;gest that the most likely out&#xAD;come is a Joe Bi&#xAD;den win with a Demo&#xAD;cratic sweep of Con&#xAD;gress, says the writer.</p>
