    <p>On what is con­sid­ered an aus­pi­cious date that has a nice ring to it, 876 cou­ples will be say­ing “I do” to­day.</p>
    <p>This makes Oct 10 by far the most pop­u­lar wed­ding day in Sin­ga­pore this year.</p>
    <p>A Reg­istry of Mar­riages (ROM) spokesman told The Straits Times that 876 cou­ples have sub­mit­ted their no­tices of mar­riage to the ROM and the Reg­istry of Mus­lim Mar­riages (ROMM) for their solem­ni­sa­tion cer­e­monies to take place to­day.</p>
    <p>There was an av­er­age of 91 solem­ni­sa­tions each Satur­day l ast year. By com­par­i­son, close to 10 times more cou­ples will be ty­ing the knot to­day.</p>
    <p>As solem­nisor Joanna Por­tilla ex­plained: “Oct 10 is usu­ally a hot date be­cause 10 is al­ways looked upon as a per­fect 10. So, they (cou­ples) wish for a per­fect union. And if a hot date or aus­pi­cious date falls on a week­end, it looks like all the stars are aligned.”</p>
    <p>Wed­ding plan­ners and solem­nisors said Oct 10 is also very pop­u­lar this year as it is an easy date to re­mem­ber, and it falls on a Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Many cou­ples pre­fer to solem­nise their mar­riages and hold their wed­ding ban­quets on week­ends to make it eas­ier for guests to at­tend.</p>
    <p>Geo­mancer Adelina Pang, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Adelina Pang Feng­shui Con­sul­tancy, noted that Oct 10 is con­sid­ered a prefer­able day for mar­riages or start­ing a new business, among other things.</p>
    <p>Oc­cu­pa­tional ther­a­pists Joyce­lyn Lim, 26, and Liew Shan Heng, 28, will be solem­nis­ing their mar­riage to­day. Ms Lim said that Oct 10 sig­ni­fies per­fec­tion in Man­darin, al­lud­ing to the id­iom “shi quan shi mei”, which means “per­fect in ev­ery way”.</p>
    <p>Last year, be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic up­ended lives all across the globe, they booked a wed­ding din­ner for 200 guests at Chi­jmes and had planned to in­vite 600 to 700 guests to their wed­ding mass to be held at the Church of Saints Peter and Paul.</p>
    <p>Their guest list kept chang­ing, as the max­i­mum num­ber of guests al­lowed at wed­ding re­cep­tions also kept chang­ing amid the evolv­ing out­break.</p>
    <p>To­day, they will be solem­nis­ing their mar­riage in the func­tion room of the con­do­minium where Ms Lim’s fam­ily lives. Just 18 fam­ily mem­bers and close friends will wit­ness the ex­change of vows.</p>
    <p>On Nov 28, their wed­ding mass in church will have 100 peo­ple in at­ten­dance. This will be fol­lowed by a din­ner ban­quet for close to 100 guests at Chi­jmes.</p>
    <p>The couple quickly dou­bled their guest list af­ter it was an­nounced last month that from Oct 3, up to 100 peo­ple, in­clud­ing the wed­ding couple, would be al­lowed at wed­ding re­cep­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim, who is the el­dest of four chil­dren and the first in her fam­ily to wed, said: “My par­ents want it to be a big af­fair. And my par­ents are very happy that we can now in­vite up to 100 peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>At this point, thou­sands of cou­ples have had their wed­ding plans dis­rupted by the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>In fact, the num­ber of cou­ples who solem­nised their mar­riages fell to 10,542 be­tween Jan­uary and July, from 13,626 dur­ing the same time pe­riod last year – a drop of 23 per cent.</p>
    <p>The ROM spokesman said that dou­ble dates, es­pe­cially those that fall on week­ends like Dec 12, as well as those deemed aus­pi­cious, tend to be pop­u­lar with cou­ples.</p>
    <p>She added that as at Tues­day, 331 cou­ples have filed their no­tices with the ROM and ROMM for mar­riage solem­ni­sa­tions on Dec 12.</p>
    <p>Dou­ble dates are pop­u­lar as they are easy to re­mem­ber, and the date, when writ­ten, looks nice, said those in­ter­viewed.</p>
    <p>Palin­drome dates, like 20/12/20, are also pop­u­lar as they are rare, mak­ing the wed­ding date more unique and mem­o­rable, said Mrs Ch­eryl Tan, founder of The Wed­ding Con­cep­teur. A palin­drome date is a date that reads the same left to right and right to left.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhammad Syahmi Yahya, 27, and Ms Nur Khai­rina Husin, 26, are solem­nis­ing their mar­riage to­day as the num­ber 10 holds spe­cial sig­nif­i­cance for them: They had their first date on Feb 10 last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Syahmi, a so­cial work as­so­ciate, got to know Ms Khai­rina, an as­sis­tant phar­ma­cist, bet­ter through Face­book. They both stud­ied at the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences.</p>
    <p>The couple had ini­tially planned for a wed­ding re­cep­tion for 1,000 guests, but can­celled it in the mid­dle of the year due to re­stric­tions im­posed on the num­ber of guests to curb the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>They will be solem­nis­ing their mar­riage at the Al-Iman Mosque with 40 of their fam­ily mem­bers and close friends.</p>
