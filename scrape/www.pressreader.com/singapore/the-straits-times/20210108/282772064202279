    <p>NEW YORK • Singer-song­writer Neil Young has sold a half share of the rights to his en­tire cat­a­logue of 1,180 songs to Lon­don-listed spe­cial­ist in­vest­ment firm Hipg­no­sis Songs Fund, the com­pany said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Young, 75, famed for songs in­clud­ing Heart Of Gold, Rockin’ In The Free World and Devil’s Side­walk, has re­leased more than 50 stu­dio al­bums and 20 live al­bums, of which seven went plat­inum and three multi-plat­inum.</p>
    <p>“I bought my first Neil Young al­bum at age seven,” said Hipg­no­sis founder Merck Mer­cu­ri­adis, say­ing the lat­est in a se­ries of such rights deals would change his com­pany for ever.</p>
    <p>“Har­vest was my com­pan­ion and I know ev­ery note, ev­ery word, ev­ery pause and si­lence in­ti­mately. Neil Young, or at least his mu­sic, has been my friend and con­stant ever since,” he added.</p>
    <p>The deal is the third that Hipg­no­sis, listed on the stock mar­ket in 2018, has struck this week af­ter agree­ments with Fleet­wood Mac gui­tarist Lind­sey Buck­ing­ham on Tues­day and record pro­ducer Jimmy Iovine on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>It fol­lows the sale last month of leg­endary singer Bob Dylan’s en­tire back cat­a­logue to Uni­ver­sal Mu­sic Group.</p>
    <p>Since float­ing in 2018, Hipg­no­sis has raised more than £1.05 bil­lion (S$1.88 bil­lion) in eq­uity cap­i­tal to bet big on the value of song roy­al­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Mer­cu­ri­adis, 57, be­lieves hit songs have be­come an as­set class that will gen­er­ate re­li­able rev­enues from con­sumers who are treat­ing mu­sic as es­sen­tial and sign­ing up to stream­ing ser­vices like Spo­tify.</p>
    <p>Hipg­no­sis now co-owns 10 of the stream­ing plat­form’s top 30 most-played songs.</p>
    <p>Last year, Mr Mer­cu­ri­adis scooped up rights to songs by crooner Barry Manilow, pro­ducer Mark Ron­son, the Wu-Tang Clan’s RZA and the co-founders of 1980s pop group Blondie. He was pre­vi­ously a manager for acts in­clud­ing El­ton John and Guns N’Roses. Hipg­no­sis did not re­veal the value of the deal for Young’s back cat­a­logue.</p>
    <p>The rise of stream­ing ser­vices means artists such as Dylan and Young are able to reach an ever-ex­pand­ing au­di­ence of fans from a younger gen­er­a­tion. Mr Mer­cu­ri­adis said: “We will work to­gether to make sure ev­ery­one gets to hear them (the songs) on Neil’s terms.”</p>
    <p>Last month, Young ended his law­suit against United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s cam­paign for play­ing two of his songs at cam­paign ral­lies without per­mis­sion.</p>
