    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>You have to be the brains of the or­gan­i­sa­tion. Help peo­ple get or­gan­ised so you can col­lec­tively tackle the big is­sues.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>It may not be po­lit­i­cal, but your con­ser­va­tive de­meanour clashes with some­one’s rad­i­cal no­tions of fun. Try to find a mid­dle ground.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Feel free to ask big ques­tions – you can han­dle the an­swers. You are con­fi­dent you can take on al­most any chal­lenge that comes your way.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Your fi­nances are caus­ing you grief, but likely not to the point of bank­ruptcy. Tackle the mat­ter with clear eyes and new ideas.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You have good an­swers – now you have to find the right ques­tions. It may stretch your ca­pa­bil­i­ties, but that can be good for you.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22) Some­times you have to mix things up a bit. Look out for fresh ways to take care of your tasks and needs. Some­thing new is on the way.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You find your­self get­ting along with oth­ers. Try to meet peo­ple with whom you usu­ally ex­pe­ri­ence some fric­tion. Things can get bet­ter.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Is it time to re­dec­o­rate? Con­sult fam­ily or room­mates first – you do not want an­other fight. Ask per­mis­sion in­stead of for­give­ness.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>You find oth­ers eas­ier to deal with – even those you would rather not see in per­son. It is a great time to patch up old feuds and make new friends.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Your ap­proach to a big sit­u­a­tion is mak­ing life weird – but you can shake things up and turn a loser into a win­ner with just one lit­tle change.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Peo­ple will pay at­ten­tion when you start speak­ing – they can tell you are filled with great en­ergy, even if they do not fol­low your every word.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>A new idea does not want to let go of your mind, even though you have other things to do. Try to sub­due it, but it is go­ing to get you even­tu­ally.</p>
