    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den has made an ur­gent plea for Amer­i­cans to wear masks to slow the spread of the coro­n­avirus, declar­ing that “a mask is not a po­lit­i­cal state­ment” as he vowed to make de­feat­ing the pan­demic his No. 1 pri­or­ity when he re­places Mr Don­ald Trump on Jan 20.</p>
    <p>“It doesn’t mat­ter who you voted for, where you stood be­fore elec­tion day,” Mr Bi­den said in short re­marks in Delaware on Mon­day af­ter meet­ing mem­bers of a newly formed Covid-19 ad­vi­sory board.</p>
    <p>“It doesn’t mat­ter your party, your point of view. We can save tens of thou­sands of lives if ev­ery­one would just wear a mask for the next few months.”</p>
    <p>He added: “Not Demo­cratic or Repub­li­can lives – Amer­i­can lives.”</p>
    <p>The mag­ni­tude of his task be­came starkly clear on Sun­day as the na­tion sur­passed 10 mil­lion cases and sank deeper into the grip of what could be­come the worst chap­ter yet of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In his re­marks, the Pres­i­den­t­elect said the grim sta­tis­tics sug­gested that the coun­try was “fac­ing a very dark win­ter” ahead.</p>
    <p>“In­fec­tion rates are go­ing up. Hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions are go­ing up. Deaths are go­ing up,” Mr Bi­den said af­ter lis­ten­ing to his ad­vis­ers dur­ing their vir­tual meet­ing.</p>
    <p>Drug­maker Pfizer an­nounced on Mon­day that an early anal­y­sis of its vac­cine trial sug­gested it was ro­bustly ef­fec­tive in pre­vent­ing Covid-19, a promis­ing de­vel­op­ment as the world has waited anx­iously for any pos­i­tive news about the pan­demic that has killed more than 1.2 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den called the de­vel­op­ment “ex­cel­lent news” in a state­ment but cau­tioned that Amer­i­cans would need to rely on ba­sic pre­cau­tions in or­der to “get back to nor­mal as fast as pos­si­ble”. He said Amer­i­cans would not be wear­ing masks for­ever but should do so un­til the vac­cine is read­ily avail­able.</p>
    <p>“It’s clear that this vac­cine, even if ap­proved, will not be widely avail­able for many months yet to come,” he said. “The chal­lenge be­fore us right now is still im­mense and grow­ing.”</p>
    <p>But while Mr Bi­den would like to see a na­tional mask man­date, his ad­vis­ers have con­cluded he does not have the le­gal au­thor­ity to im­pose one. So he will try to in­crease mask wear­ing in other ways.</p>
    <p>He has al­ready said that, as pres­i­dent, he would re­quire masks on all fed­eral prop­erty, an ex­ec­u­tive or­der that could have wide reach and is likely to come in the first hours or days of his pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s com­ments about masks were a strik­ing con­trast with Mr Trump, who has spent the past eight months dis­miss­ing or play­ing down the need for Amer­i­cans to wear masks, say­ing fre­quently – and falsely – that there was deep dis­agree­ment about whether masks were ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>As cases surge in over half of the coun­try, its wors­en­ing out­look comes at an ex­tremely dif­fi­cult junc­ture: Mr Trump, who re­mains in of­fice un­til Jan­uary, is openly at odds with his own coro­n­avirus ad­vis­ers – in­clud­ing about maskwear­ing – and win­ter, when in­fec­tions are only ex­pected to spread faster, is com­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den named Dr Rick Bright, a for­mer top vac­cine of­fi­cial in the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion who sub­mit­ted a whistle­blower com­plaint to Congress, as a mem­ber of the Covid-19 task force ad­vis­ing him dur­ing the tran­si­tion, of­fi­cials an­nounced on Mon­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den had al­ready re­vealed the three co-chairs of the 13-mem­ber panel: Dr Vivek Murthy, a sur­geon gen­eral un­der then Pres­i­dent Barack Obama; Mr David Kessler, a for­mer com­mis­sioner of the Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion; and Dr Mar­cella Nunez-Smith, a pro­fes­sor of pub­lic health at Yale Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Dr An­thony Fauci, direc­tor of the US Na­tional In­sti­tute of Al­lergy and In­fec­tious Dis­eases, who has re­peat­edly clashed with Pres­i­dent Trump over the man­age­ment of the pan­demic, told CNN on Mon­day he be­lieves he will stay in his cur­rent role through the re­main­der of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion and into the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, who is try­ing to con­test his loss in last week’s pres­i­den­tial elec­tion to Mr Bi­den in the courts, has pub­licly crit­i­cised Dr Fauci, the coun­try’s leader on fight­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases.</p>
    <p>It doesn’t mat­ter your party, your point of view. We can save tens of thou­sands of lives if ev­ery­one would just wear a mask for the next few months...</p>
    <p>Not Demo­cratic or Repub­li­can lives – Amer­i­can lives.</p>
