    <p>Hong Kong wants to roll out a free vol­un­tary test­ing pro­gramme for Covid-19 to all res­i­dents in two weeks, with the help of the cen­tral gov­ern­ment. Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam said yes­ter­day that the pro­gramme had to be safe, se­cure and car­ried out as soon as pos­si­ble to de­tect silent trans­mis­sions quickly.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong gov­ern­ment wants to roll out a free vol­un­tary test­ing pro­gramme for Covid-19 to all res­i­dents in two weeks, with the help of the cen­tral gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>While de­tails are sketchy, Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam said yes­ter­day that the univer­sal test­ing pro­gramme had to be safe, se­cure and car­ried out as soon as pos­si­ble to de­tect silent trans­mis­sions quickly.</p>
    <p>She said so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures would be ad­hered to dur­ing the test­ing, and the gov­ern­ment would try to make it con­ve­nient for peo­ple to pick up and re­turn spec­i­men bot­tles for throat swabs.</p>
    <p>“I can­not al­low thou­sands of Hong Kong peo­ple queue­ing up and crowd­ing to await their turn to have a swab,” Mrs Lam said, adding that the bot­tles’ col­lec­tion and dis­tri­bu­tion points would be sep­a­rated.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, per­sonal data would be pro­tected, she said.</p>
    <p>Lab­o­ra­to­ries con­duct­ing tests on spec­i­mens would not be given any per­sonal in­for­ma­tion, and tests that turn up pos­i­tive would be passed on to the Depart­ment of Health, which would have ac­cess to bar­codes al­low­ing it to iden­tify in­fected peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“So, if peo­ple still have con­cerns, they don’t need to come for­ward,” Mrs Lam said, adding that all the de­tails for the pro­gramme had not been worked out, but ru­mours cir­cu­lat­ing on so­cial me­dia prompted her to “con­sider it nec­es­sary to come up and dis­pel any mis­un­der­stand­ing in the first in­stance”.</p>
    <p>Ru­mours have been rife in the past week that the seven-mem­ber main­land med­i­cal team, sent to Hong Kong to help con­duct nu­cleic acid Covid-19 tests, were in the city to col­lect DNA sam­ples from res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment dis­missed this last Sun­day, hours af­ter the team landed in Hong Kong, say­ing that all tests car­ried out in the city would meet all le­gal re­quire­ments and no sam­ples would be sent back to the main­land.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics had ex­pressed con­cerns as one of the main­land firms be­hind the test­ing, BGI Group, has been black­listed by the United States fol­low­ing al­le­ga­tions that the group’s sub­sidiaries had taken DNA sam­ples from Uighurs in Xin­jiang prov­ince in China for sur­veil­lance pur­poses.</p>
    <p>BGI has de­nied the al­le­ga­tions. Ques­tions have also been raised about the qual­i­fi­ca­tions of the main­land med­i­cal team, prompt­ing Mrs Lam to stress that they are qual­i­fied in China and were thus given ex­emp­tions un­der Hong Kong law.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, leader of the main­land med­i­cal team Yu Dewen told Xin­hua news agency that he hoped to ex­pand Hong Kong’s test­ing ca­pa­bil­ity to over 200,000 peo­ple a day, up from the 10,000 daily ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam also con­firmed that the Sun Yat Sen Me­mo­rial Park Sports Cen­tre would be turned into a lab­o­ra­tory and that about 60 staff from the main­land would be ex­empted from the manda­tory 14-day quar­an­tine to help lo­cal of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>She said 1,000 beds would be added in the next few weeks to the Asi­aWorld-Expo med­i­cal fa­cil­ity that was set up re­cently, while a tem­po­rary hos­pi­tal would be built over the next few months on a 32,000 sq m site next to the con­ven­tion cen­tre.</p>
    <p>When asked about the cost of the en­tire ex­er­cise, Mrs Lam did not give an es­ti­mate, but noted that the cen­tral gov­ern­ment is chip­ping in.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong saw a spike in Covid-19 cases last month, with 40 per cent of the sources of in­fec­tions un­known. The resur­gence has put pres­sure on the city’s health­care sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials have tight­ened so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures in the past weeks as the pan­demic shows no signs of eas­ing, with civil ser­vants told to work from home for an­other week and gyms and bars shut too.</p>
    <p>The health au­thor­i­ties yes­ter­day re­ported 89 new con­firmed cases, bring­ing the to­tal tally of cases in the city to 3,938, in­clud­ing 47 deaths. Among the new cases, 49 had links to pa­tients while 32 were of un­known ori­gin.</p>
