    <p>The le­gal in­dus­try is get­ting a legup in har­ness­ing tech­nol­ogy un­der a new 10-year plan that will see more sup­port for law firms in adopt­ing tech­nol­ogy and more op­por­tu­ni­ties for law stu­dents in learning dig­i­tal skills.</p>
    <p>The Le­gal In­dus­try Tech­nol­ogy and In­no­va­tion Roadmap (TIR) was launched yes­ter­day by Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Law Ed­win Tong at TechLaw.Fest, an an­nual con­fer­ence on law and tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>It sets out plans by the Min­istry of Law (MinLaw) to pro­mote in­no­va­tion, tech­nol­ogy adop­tion and de­vel­op­ment in Sin­ga­pore’s le­gal in­dus­try for the next decade.</p>
    <p>These in­clude work­ing with the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Author­ity and in­dus­try part­ners to de­velop a plan that helps law firms as­sess their dig­i­tal readi­ness and iden­tify tech­nol­ogy they can adopt.</p>
    <p>MinLaw will also ex­plore the pos­si­bil­ity of a cloud-based plat­form for le­gal tech­nol­ogy, which will help law firms find the right soft­ware for their needs, among other things.</p>
    <p>Le­gal tech­nol­ogy, or legal­tech, refers to the use of tech­nol­ogy and soft­ware that in­crease the pro­duc­tiv­ity of le­gal ser­vice providers and help con­sumers ac­cess le­gal ex­per­tise.</p>
    <p>In-house lawyers can look for­ward to up­com­ing ini­tia­tives to sup­port them in their ini­tial adop­tion of legal­tech, such as tools to re­struc­ture their work­flow.</p>
    <p>As part of plans to make Sin­ga­pore a lead­ing global legal­tech hub, MinLaw will be work­ing with the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore to at­tract global law prac­tices and legal­tech firms to es­tab­lish op­er­a­tions here.</p>
    <p>Other ini­tia­tives out­lined in the road map in­clude en­abling qual­i­fied lawyers to count legal­tech up­skilling pro­grammes as part of their con­tin­u­ing pro­fes­sional de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Law schools are also en­cour­aged to fur­ther in­fuse tech­nol­ogy into their cur­ricu­lum, in or­der to bet­ter equip grad­u­ates with rel­e­vant dig­i­tal skills.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently law un­der­grad­u­ates from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore can choose to take a mi­nor in business an­a­lyt­ics, com­puter sci­ence or in­for­ma­tion sys­tems.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity has also re­cently launched a new Bach­e­lor of Sci­ence (Com­put­ing and Law) de­gree.</p>
    <p>In a press state­ment yes­ter­day, MinLaw said that the TIR is the re­sult of on­go­ing en­gage­ment ef­forts.</p>
    <p>The road map comes af­ter two ini­tia­tives were pre­vi­ously in­tro­duced to help Sin­ga­pore law firms em­brace tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Tech Start for Law was launched by MinLaw, The Law So­ci­ety of Sin­ga­pore and the then Spring Sin­ga­pore in 2017. It ended in 2018.</p>
    <p>The scheme pro­vided $2.8 mil­lion in fund­ing sup­port for law firms to adopt base­line tech­nol­ogy so­lu­tions, such as tools for doc­u­ment man­age­ment that let lawyers per­form daily tasks more ef­fi­ciently.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond, Tech-cel­er­ate for Law, was in­tro­duced last year to cover part of the first-year cost of adopt­ing base­line and ad­vanced tech­nol­ogy so­lu­tions by law firms.</p>
    <p>The scheme, which in­volves $3.68 mil­lion in fund­ing sup­port, has been ex­tended to Jan­uary next year.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Tong, who is also Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Min­is­ter, said that tech­nol­ogy should not be seen as a “silver bul­let” and that lawyers re­main very much in de­mand.</p>
    <p>“At the end of the day, whether you do ne­go­ti­a­tions as a trans­ac­tional lawyer, or you do ad­vo­cacy as a dis­putes lawyer, that com­mu­ni­ca­tion or ad­vo­cacy skill – I think it is some­thing that is not re­place­able...</p>
    <p>“The use of tech­nol­ogy is to make them or the in­dus­try a lot more ef­fi­cient, and to al­low them to fo­cus on re­ally high-value work,” he said.</p>
