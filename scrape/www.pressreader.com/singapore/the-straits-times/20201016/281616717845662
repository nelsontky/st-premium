    <p>A day after one of the worst pow­er­re­lated dis­rup­tions in years that hit three MRT lines and left thou­sands stranded, train ser­vice on the lines re­sumed, with com­muters say­ing that their morn­ing rides were un­event­ful.</p>
    <p>At about 6.45am at Yew Tee MRT sta­tion yes­ter­day, com­muters who spoke to The Straits Times said noth­ing was amiss when they took their daily ride.</p>
    <p>Mr Muham­mad Nur Nazirul, a full-time na­tional ser­vice­man, said that his com­mute from Hougang to</p>
    <p>Yew Tee went with­out a hitch.</p>
    <p>“I only found out about the dis­rup­tions on Thurs­day morn­ing through the news. It was quite sur­pris­ing to me, espe­cially as so many sta­tions were af­fected,” said the 22-year-old.</p>
    <p>A power fault on Wed­nes­day shut down train ser­vices on parts of the North-South and East-West MRT lines at around 7pm, se­verely dis­rupt­ing the evening rush-hour com­mute. Half an hour later, the fault dis­rupted ser­vice along a 16-sta­tion stretch of the Cir­cle Line, which was fixed by 8.40pm.</p>
    <p>Ser­vice re­sumed at all sta­tions along the North-South and EastWest lines at 10.35pm.</p>
    <p>A break­down of in­su­la­tion of a power ca­ble be­tween Tuas Link and Tuas West Road sta­tions led to a chain re­ac­tion that caused the dis­rup­tion, which is one of the most se­ri­ous power-re­lated in­ci­dents to hit the MRT net­work in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>Ms Jane Tan, a pub­lic ser­vant who works in Jurong, was among the</p>
    <p>com­muters yes­ter­day morn­ing at Jurong East MRT sta­tion.</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing the sit­u­a­tion the night be­fore, she said the bus in­ter­change was packed as com­muters streamed out of the MRT sta­tion after it was an­nounced that there was no train ser­vice.</p>
    <p>She took a bus to­wards Seran­goon, where she lives, and alighted at Cle­menti MRT sta­tion to see if she could hop onto a Pasir Ris­bound train. “It was re­ally choked,” she said of the sta­tion, where a crowd had formed.</p>
    <p>The 26-year-old added that she had to forgo a din­ner ap­point­ment at Nex with a friend, and had a meal at Cle­menti be­fore head­ing home. She ar­rived home at about 9.30pm, two hours and 15 min­utes after she left the Jurong East sta­tion.</p>
    <p>“It could have been a lot worse if the full work­force was out, so I am thank­ful that I even­tu­ally got home okay,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mr Alan Tan, 33, had to take a pri­vate-hire car home after trains stopped run­ning from Jurong East. He was at the sta­tion at about 8pm on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“I ended up tak­ing a Grab home to Sem­bawang, but it is not an is­sue. There is no need to get an­gry, it won’t change any­thing,” said Mr Tan, who works in the food dis­tri­bu­tion in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>A com­muter who wanted to be known only as Ms So said she was in a train at Bis­han sta­tion at around 7.30pm on Wed­nes­day when the dis­rup­tion hap­pened.</p>
    <p>She man­aged to board a bus for Woodleigh, which con­nected her to the North East Line (NEL) and Seran­goon MRT sta­tion.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, she was at Seran­goon MRT sta­tion at 7.30am, the usual time she leaves for of­fice.</p>
    <p>“I left at the same time be­cause I thought that ev­ery­thing would have been fixed by now, and I didn’t think I would be un­lucky twice,” said the 24-year-old, who works in op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“There was a brief mo­ment when the train sud­denly stopped on the pur­ple line (NEL), but thank­fully it was noth­ing,” she added.</p>
    <p>House­wife Siti Hasna, who lives in Choa Chu Kang and re­lies on pub­lic trans­port, said break­downs are in­evitable.</p>
    <p>“The trains are al­ways mov­ing, and I would ex­pect them to break down… it is just mat­ter of time.”</p>
    <p>“I take pub­lic trans­port pretty of­ten, and things have been okay, so far so good... I guess I am lucky,” added the 34-year-old.</p>
