    <p>Two lawyers were charged in a district court yes­ter­day with at­tempt­ing to in­ten­tion­ally ob­struct the course of jus­tice.</p>
    <p>Wee Hong Sh­ern, 33, and Ong Peng Boon, 64, are ac­cused of com­mit­ting the of­fence on May 10 last year.</p>
    <p>A search on the Min­istry of Law’s web­site showed that Ong is a di­rec­tor at Ong & Co law firm while Wee is the sole pro­pri­etor of Adep­tus Law Cor­po­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>A third man, Selva Ku­mar Subra­ma­niam, 42, who is said to be linked to their cases, was also handed a sim­i­lar charge yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Selva Ku­mar is ac­cused of at­tempt­ing to in­ten­tion­ally ob­struct the course of jus­tice by pro­vid­ing some in­for­ma­tion to Wee, who was then his de­fence lawyer, be­tween 10am and 11.51am on May 10 last year.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, the in­for­ma­tion was al­legedly linked to an in­ves­ti­ga­tion by Singapore Cus­toms.</p>
    <p>It was said to be sent to alert a syndicate deal­ing with duty un­paid cig­a­rettes to clear its premises of the goods.</p>
    <p>Wee is said to have sent Ong a text mes­sage at around 11.52am, stat­ing: “I talked to Ah Boon to up­date. Ba­si­cally: Buf­falo is busted. Fac­tory is safe for now but he warns it’s only a mat­ter of time be­fore they find out where it is as they have the SD cars of Ah Boon’s ve­hi­cle.</p>
    <p>“They can trace buf­falo and find fac­tory even­tu­ally. So he said to clear ev­ery­thing from Fac­tory ASAP.</p>
    <p>“Ev­i­dence has come out that ST has been paid by China man. His Zello phone was seized and he didn’t have time delete con­vos. Bail opened at 55K.”</p>
    <p>It was not clear in court doc­u­ments what the text mes­sage was re­fer­ring to.</p>
    <p>The doc­u­ments also did not re­veal fur­ther de­tails about the case in­volv­ing the cig­a­rettes or Ah Boon’s iden­tity.</p>
    <p>Ong is ac­cused of for­ward­ing the mes­sage to a man known only as Tan Hock Ann, whose de­tails were also not re­vealed in court doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the three Sin­ga­pore­ans were each of­fered bail of $10,000 and their pre-trial con­fer­ence will be held on Oct 5.</p>
    <p>Of­fend­ers convicted of in­ten­tion­ally ob­struct­ing the course of jus­tice can be jailed for up to seven years and fined.</p>
