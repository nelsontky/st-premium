    <p>While the goods and ser­vices tax (GST) rate will re­main at 7 per cent next year, the in­crease can­not be de­ferred in­def­i­nitely as the rev­enues are needed to sup­port Sin­ga­pore’s spend­ing needs to se­cure its longterm fu­ture, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to study the tim­ing of in­creas­ing the GST rate care­fully, tak­ing into ac­count the pace of our eco­nomic re­cov­ery, our rev­enue out­look and how much spend­ing we can de­fer to later years, with­out jeop­ar­dis­ing our long-term needs,” he told Par­lia­ment in round­ing up the de­bate on the Gov­ern­ment’s Covid-19 strat­egy.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said GST col­lec­tions this year are pro­jected to be down by 14 per cent from ini­tial es­ti­mates be­fore the start of the year, mainly due to travel dis­rup­tions and the im­pact of the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Col­lec­tion of GST is also ex­pected to stay lower than usual for a few more years un­til in­ter­na­tional travel re­cov­ers fully, he added.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary, Mr Heng, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies and Fi­nance Min­is­ter, had an­nounced that the GST rate will re­main at 7 per cent next year.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, he as­sured Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast GRC) that a $6 bil­lion As­sur­ance Pack­age for GST has been set aside to help Sin­ga­pore­ans when the rate is even­tu­ally raised.</p>
    <p>Ms Foo had ear­lier raised con­cerns about the im­pend­ing GST hike amid the gloomy eco­nomic en­vi­ron­ment. Mr Heng said the As­sur­ance Pack­age will off­set the GST in­crease for five years for most house­holds, and 10 years for those liv­ing in one- to three-room flats.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that over 60 per cent of GST col­lected from in­di­vid­u­als and house­holds comes from for­eign­ers re­sid­ing here, tourists and the top 20 per cent of house­holds, Mr Heng said shelv­ing the GST rate in­crease in­def­i­nitely – as Non-Con­stituency MP Leong Mun Wai had sug­gested – means for­go­ing the ad­di­tional rev­enue from these groups that can be used to im­prove the lives of Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to a ques­tion by Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Pan­jang) on how the Gov­ern­ment would bal­ance its Bud­get with the rev­enue sit­u­a­tion re­main­ing weak, Mr Heng said that rev­enues in the medium term are ex­pected to be sub­dued and un­cer­tain for two rea­sons.</p>
    <p>One is that global eco­nomic growth will likely re­main weak­ened for sev­eral years, and the other is that the global com­pe­ti­tion for tax rev­enues can be ex­pected to in­ten­sify, he said.</p>
    <p>Even with these chal­lenges, Sin­ga­pore can­not lose sight of its goal to se­cure its long-term needs, such as those of pub­lic health­care and preschool ed­u­ca­tion, he said.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment is study­ing how to strengthen its fis­cal tool­kit, Mr Heng said, and had been look­ing at bor­row­ing for ma­jor long-term in­fra­struc­ture even be­fore Covid-19 struck. But its ap­proach will be prin­ci­pled and pru­dent, he em­pha­sised.</p>
    <p>“We will bor­row only for in­fra­struc­ture that ben­e­fits mul­ti­ple gen­er­a­tions, and en­sure that our debt level and fu­ture re­pay­ments are sus­tain­able... We will not bor­row just to make up for rev­enue short­falls or be op­por­tunis­tic in tim­ing the market.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, for re­cur­rent spend­ing like health­care and ed­u­ca­tion that ben­e­fits the cur­rent gen­er­a­tion, the re­spon­si­ble way is to pay for them us­ing re­cur­rent rev­enues like taxes. “This dis­ci­pline en­sures that ev­ery gen­er­a­tion earns and pays its share,” he stressed.</p>
    <p>In his speech, Mr Heng also touched on how the lat­est round of Covid-19 sup­port mea­sures he an­nounced in Au­gust is be­ing funded en­tirely from bud­get re­al­lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing questions from MPs such as Mr Mu­rali Pil­lai (Bukit Ba­tok) and Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong GRC) on whether the Gov­ern­ment was ex­tend­ing the time hori­zon or cut­ting back over­all in­vest­ment on key in­fras­truc­tural projects, Mr Heng said the Gov­ern­ment did an ex­ten­sive scan to iden­tify de­fer­ments or re­duc­tions in spend­ing.</p>
    <p>Some ex­pen­di­tures, such as those for MRT lines, Hous­ing Board up­grad­ing, and sew­er­age and drainage works, were de­ferred as a re­sult of de­lays aris­ing from the cir­cuit breaker and the re­open­ing of the con­struc­tion sec­tor after that. Other ex­pen­di­tures were lower than ear­lier pro­jected due to Covid-19 and safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, most of these are not sav­ings but de­layed spend­ing, which will still be in­curred in fu­ture years,” he said. “These projects are needed to raise Sin­ga­pore­ans’ stan­dard of liv­ing and our eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. We will push ahead when the con­di­tions al­low.”</p>
    <p>Ma­jor in­fra­struc­ture projects are al­ready be­ing re­viewed to ac­count for the longer-term im­pact of Covid-19, said Mr Heng. An ex­am­ple is how the con­struc­tion of Changi Air­port Ter­mi­nal 5 has been put on hold for two years.</p>
    <p>There could be fur­ther de­fer­ments or re­duc­tions in scale if travel de­mand takes longer to re­cover, said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, the need to build in more re­silience and safety fea­tures could also raise project costs.</p>
