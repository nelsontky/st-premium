    <p>Our neigh­bour owns a Lam­borgh­ini. When start­ing the car, he revs up the en­gine for a few sec­onds and lets it idle for five min­utes or longer be­fore driv­ing off. Is this ap­pro­pri­ate?</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a cold start, all fuel-in­jected cars – and even some old car­bur­reted mod­els with au­to­matic chokes – will start up and run at higher than nor­mal idle revs.</p>
    <p>At the in­stant the en­gine fires up, the revs could be higher be­fore set­tling at the fast-idle speed. And sports cars, which usu­ally have big­ger en­gines, sound louder es­pe­cially on a quiet morn­ing. It is the en­gine man­age­ment sys­tem of the Lam­borgh­ini that raises the revs ev­ery morn­ing.</p>
    <p>But your ques­tion on whether the car needs to idle for five min­utes be­fore it can be driven is per­ti­nent.</p>
    <p>Years ago, when en­gine and lu­bri­cant tech­nolo­gies were not as ad­vanced, warm­ing up a car was a good idea. This is be­cause when the en­gine is at rest, much of the en­gine oil goes back into the oil sump. Not much lu­bri­ca­tion is left on the mov­ing parts that ex­pe­ri­ence wear and tear. There­fore, warm­ing up a car was needed to get the oil cir­cu­lat­ing and lu­bri­cat­ing again.</p>
    <p>To­day’s new cars no longer need this step. The owner’s man­ual would likely in­struct one to drive off im­me­di­ately in a smooth, gen­tle man­ner. Modern en­gine lu­bri­cants leave a film of pro­tec­tion over crit­i­cal en­gine parts. So, even if the bulk of the mo­tor oil is back in the sump, parts are never left bare.</p>
    <p>If your neigh­bour in­sists on let­ting his car’s en­gine idle, he is wast­ing fuel and need­lessly pol­lut­ing the en­vi­ron­ment. In fu­ture, when sports cars tran­si­tion to be­com­ing elec­tric, this will no longer be an is­sue.</p>
