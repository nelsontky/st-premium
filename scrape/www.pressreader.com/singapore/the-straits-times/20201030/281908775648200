    <p>•</p>
    <p>Thai Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha has given the green light to amend­ing the king­dom’s Con­sti­tu­tion, as Par­lia­ment’s two-day spe­cial de­bate on the on­go­ing po­lit­i­cal cri­sis wrapped up.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut said on Wed­nes­day that he agreed with many of the points made by MPs about the cri­sis, but said the main thing was to sup­port char­ter amend­ment.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Par­lia­ment must fol­low the cur­rent Con­sti­tu­tion, since it would re­main in ef­fect un­til a new Con­sti­tu­tion is es­tab­lished, he added.</p>
    <p>Char­ter amend­ment is one of three core de­mands be­ing made by pro-democ­racy pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>They have also called for the res­ig­na­tion of Mr Prayut and his gov­ern­ment, and re­forms of the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut has in­sisted he will not re­sign but said he had no ob­jec­tion to “switch­ing off” the un­elected Se­nate’s power to vote for a prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>“I agree to amend the Con­sti­tu­tion,” said the pre­mier. “As for the is­sue of sen­a­tors choos­ing a prime min­is­ter, I don’t want to em­pha­sise it. I have no ob­jec­tion to them choos­ing or not choos­ing. It’s a mat­ter for de­bate in Par­lia­ment.”</p>
    <p>On an­other mat­ter, Mr Prayut said the Cab­i­net has agreed that a rec­on­cil­i­a­tion com­mit­tee should be set up to find a way of re­solv­ing the on­go­ing po­lit­i­cal cri­sis.</p>
    <p>He said the com­mit­tee will be ap­pointed by the House and will in­clude rep­re­sen­ta­tives from dif­fer­ent par­ties, the Se­nate, MPs and pro-democ­racy ac­tivists.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a prom­i­nent Thai anti-es­tab­lish­ment fig­ure was charged yes­ter­day over his role in an il­le­gal flash mob protest last year, pros­e­cu­tors in the coun­try’s cap­i­tal said.</p>
    <p>Thanathorn Juan­groon­gru­angkit, a charis­matic bil­lion­aire and founder of the dis­solved Fu­ture For­ward party, is ac­cused of five pub­lic as­sem­bly vi­o­la­tions linked to the rally in Bangkok’s cen­tral shop­ping dis­trict in De­cem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>Charges in­clude fail­ing to no­tify the po­lice of a pub­lic gath­er­ing, block­ing a sky train sta­tion, us­ing a mega­phone with­out per­mis­sion and hold­ing a rally close to a royal res­i­dence, his lawyer Krisadang Nutcharut said.</p>
    <p>“The max­i­mum sen­tence is six months in jail,” he told re­porters.</p>
    <p>The charges are part of a slew of re­cent le­gal ac­tions against Thanathorn and other Thai MPs elected un­der the Fu­ture For­ward ban­ner but who have now shifted to its suc­ces­sor, Move For­ward Party.</p>
    <p>The in­dict­ment comes a day af­ter Ms Tanwarin Sukkhapisi­t, Thai­land’s first trans­gen­der leg­is­la­tor, was dis­qual­i­fied from Par­lia­ment af­ter the con­sti­tu­tional court found her guilty of own­ing shares in a me­dia com­pany.</p>
    <p>Thanathorn also fell foul of the same elec­toral law and lost his seat in Novem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>Also fac­ing crim­i­nal charges over the De­cem­ber flash mob are Move For­ward Party leader Pita Lim­jaroen­rat and for­mer Fu­ture For­ward party of­fi­cials Piyabutr Saengkanok­kul, Pan­nika Wanich and Pairatchot­e Chan­taraka­chorn.</p>
