    <p>If you love nat­u­ral wine and hearty food and think David Bowie is in­com­pa­ra­ble, you will love Rebel Rebel. Hang­ing out at this newish nat­u­ral wine bar in Bukit Pa­soh feels a lot like chill­ing at a friend’s man cave, with nat­u­ral wine, hearty food and deep con­ver­sa­tion; all grown up from your rebel rebel days.</p>
    <p>Co-owner Aman­ul­lah Khan, 44, has an­other busi­ness, Ar­ti­san Cel­lars, which sells some ter­rific la­bels he sources painstak­ingly. And the wine list at the bar is a show­case of some of the best. He and co-owner Eu­gene Goh, 42, are se­ri­ous food­ies, so of course, the menu is solid.</p>
    <p>It is a con­cise one, but chef</p>
    <p>Deb­o­rah Yeo, 36, who worked at Co­cotte and Burnt Ends, is look­ing to ex­pand the of­fer­ings once she has more hands in the kitchen.</p>
    <p>She does won­der­ful things with pig parts.</p>
    <p>Pork Fat ($6), whipped to ethe­real light­ness, is sprin­kled with toasted grains of farro and bar­ley that re­tain their crunch de­spite sit­ting in a savoury semi-brit­tle of honey, soya sauce, fish sauce and pork jus. Or­der Sour­dough ($8) made in-house, wave away the olive oil and but­ter and slather the slices with the lard.</p>
    <p>Pig’s Head ($28, right), one of three main cour­ses, is tagli­atelle mixed with the afore­men­tioned head, crunchy bits of pig ears and napped in a barely-there sauce that has a bright per­son­al­ity and a se­ri­ous lick of chilli. It tastes of that vine­gary hot sauce that used to be a sta­ple be­fore a raft of ar­ti­sanal ones came onto the mar­ket. Some­times, an oldie can lift a goodie.</p>
    <p>While I would be happy with just these two of­fer­ings, please also or­der Prawn ($12 for two pieces) – old school prawn toast made luxe with uni. That is as lus­cious as it sounds. Crab ($20 for two pieces), is sim­i­larly com­pelling. Piles of blue swim­mer and king crab meat are piled on lettuce leaves with a cele­riac salad. Crunch, sweet­ness and earth­i­ness in one bite.</p>
    <p>To drink, I would go with a glass of the Fu­ji­maru Ta­ble Top Daidai Iro ($20), an or­ange (well, more like a dusky pink) wine from Ja­pan made with Delaware grapes. Some peo­ple find the funk­i­ness of nat­u­ral wine frus­trat­ing, but I like funk. It goes so beau­ti­fully with the lard and has hints of bub­bles.</p>
    <p>If you have ever tried to buy bot­tles of Beau Paysage wine from Ja­pan, and failed, well, Rebel Rebel has them on the wine list. At a rather eye-wa­ter­ing price. The 2014 Le Feu is a princely $284 a bot­tle.</p>
    <p>That, per­haps, re­flects just how dif­fi­cult it is to get any bot­tle from the win­ery. And the rise and rise of nat­u­ral wines from Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>It’s the next big thing, Mr Khan pre­dicts. Go have some at Rebel Rebel. WHERE: Rebel Rebel, 14 Bukit Pa­soh</p>
    <p>Road MRT: Ou­tram TEL: 6224-5466 OPEN: 5 to 11pm (Tues­day to Satur­day)</p>
