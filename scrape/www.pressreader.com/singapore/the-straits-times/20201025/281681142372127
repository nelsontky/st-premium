    <p>The drain­ing of smartphone bat­ter­ies, con­ve­nience in the work­place and se­cu­rity con­cerns were among the rea­sons given by those who rushed to col­lect their TraceTo­gether to­kens yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>There were long queues at some of the 38 com­mu­nity cen­tres and clubs here to col­lect the de­vice on the first week­end since the Gov­ern­ment an­nounced that check­ing in with the TraceTo­gether app or to­ken would be manda­tory by end-De­cem­ber at all pub­lic venues, in­clud­ing restau­rants, work­places, schools and shopping malls.</p>
    <p>This prompted the Gov­ern­ment Technology Agency to post a no­tice on the To­ken Go Where web­site that said: “We are cur­rently ex­pe­ri­enc­ing high de­mand for the col­lec­tion of to­kens.”</p>
    <p>It ad­vised peo­ple against rush­ing to col­lect the de­vices, and to check for avail­abil­ity be­fore head­ing down to the col­lec­tion cen­tres, re­mind­ing them that there is no need to get the to­ken if they al­ready have the app.</p>
    <p>The to­kens will be made avail­able at all 108 com­mu­nity cen­tres is­land­wide by the end of next month.</p>
    <p>At Yio Chu Kang Com­mu­nity Club, IT en­gi­neer Rudi Rashid, 44, waited for around 40 min­utes to col­lect eight to­kens for his house­hold and his brother’s fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Ac­com­pa­nied by his 10-year-old daugh­ter Sri Rai­hanah, Mr Rudi had taken pub­lic trans­port from his home in Sem­bawang to the venue, as col­lec­tion is not yet avail­able at the com­mu­nity cen­tre near his place.</p>
    <p>He said that even though there is a TraceTo­gether smartphone app, he prefers not to use it as it drains his phone battery.</p>
    <p>“I work as an IT en­gi­neer in a phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal set­ting. As I en­ter many labs and fa­cil­i­ties, I can’t bring my phone around all the time,” he added. “I also don’t want to leave my phone’s Blue­tooth on all the time, for se­cu­rity rea­sons.”</p>
    <p>When The Sun­day Times vis­ited Yio Chu Kang Com­mu­nity Club at around 2pm, a sin­gle queue stretched past a sign in­di­cat­ing a 45-minute wait­ing time. It led to four sep­a­rate coun­ters where vol­un­teers were giv­ing out the to­kens.</p>
    <p>Those col­lect­ing the to­kens are also given a mag­netic in­for­ma­tion guide ex­plain­ing how to use the de­vice, which comes in colours such as green, or­ange and white.</p>
    <p>Mr Richard Chew, 55, a project man­ager at a con­struc­tion site near Yio Chu Kang Com­mu­nity Club, picked up eight to­kens for him­self, his friends and col­leagues yes­ter­day af­ter­noon, af­ter queue­ing for half an hour. He said: “It is eas­ier for me to use this (to­ken) to en­ter the con­struc­tion sites, be­cause in my line of work I need to use my phone for other pur­poses.”</p>
    <p>Over at Teck Ghee Com­mu­nity</p>
    <p>Club in Ang Mo Kio, there were three queues in the main hall, where a pro­jec­tor screen played a video ex­plain­ing how the TraceTo­gether to­ken works. For ex­am­ple, there is no Global Po­si­tion­ing System track­ing for each to­ken, and the data col­lected stays on the de­vice and is au­to­mat­i­cally deleted af­ter 25 days.</p>
    <p>Out­side, there was a pri­or­ity queue for preg­nant women, wheel­chair users and the hand­i­capped.</p>
    <p>Sales man­ager Ho Kai Peng, 37, who was there to col­lect seven to­kens for her fam­ily, said: “Some of my friends have the app, but I worry that it’s battery drain­ing. I don’t carry a power bank around with me.”</p>
    <p>She added that she has a bet­ter idea of how the de­vice works af­ter watch­ing the video while in the queue. She also plans to read the mag­netic in­for­ma­tion guide, which she in­tends to stick on her re­frig­er­a­tor at home.</p>
