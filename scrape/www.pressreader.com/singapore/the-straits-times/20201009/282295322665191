    <p>Tokyo Olympics or­gan­is­ers are ex­pect­ing to wel­come in­ter­na­tional spec­ta­tors at next year’s Games de­spite the Covid-19 pan­demic, In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC) pres­i­dent Thomas Bach said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>In March, the Ja­panese gov­ern­ment and the IOC post­poned the 2020 Games to July 23-Aug 8 next year be­cause of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“We are work­ing on the ba­sis of course there will be in­ter­na­tional spec­ta­tors (in Tokyo),” Bach told a con­fer­ence call at the end of an ex­ec­u­tive board meet­ing.</p>
    <p>“What we do not know is if we can fill sta­dia to full ca­pac­ity or if other mea­sures would have to be ap­plied.”</p>
    <p>He added that the re­sump­tion of some Ja­panese sports leagues had been a pos­i­tive sign.</p>
    <p>“We saw a very en­cour­ag­ing start in some of the leagues in Ja­pan in the past weeks with a good num­ber of spec­ta­tors,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We have to see again with the ad­di­tional tools at our dis­posal next year how we can fill the sta­dia and how much we can fill them.”</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors to the Olympics usu­ally book their tick­ets many months or years in advance but in Tokyo’s case the IOC will have a clearer pic­ture only by the end of this year.</p>
    <p>“We are here with a lot of un­cer­tain­ties,” the IOC’s Olympic Games ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Christophe Dubi said. “We have not es­tab­lished any time­lines. It is pre­ma­ture to say at this stage we have to have such a de­ci­sion or such a de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>“At the end of the year we will have a lot of clar­ity, what to do from an op­er­a­tional stand­point. By De­cem­ber we have a clearer pic­ture.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the IOC is in­ves­ti­gat­ing claims by Be­larus ath­letes they are be­ing dis­crim­i­nated against be­cause of their po­lit­i­cal views.</p>
    <p>Be­larus has been rocked by protests since an Aug 9 elec­tion that con­firmed an­other term for Pres­i­dent Alexan­der Lukashenko, who is also pres­i­dent of his coun­try’s na­tional Olympic com­mit­tee (NOC).</p>
    <p>“We are very con­cerned about the in­for­ma­tion we are get­ting,” Bach said, adding that the IOC had cor­re­sponded with the na­tional com­mit­tee and would now also look into schol­ar­ship and other funds that had been di­rected to Be­larus and whether they had reached the in­di­vid­u­als they were meant for.</p>
    <p>“Non-dis­crim­i­na­tion is an es­sen­tial value of the Olympic move­ment. This is why we are tak­ing it so se­ri­ously. The ex­ec­u­tive board... de­cided we will strengthen our in­ves­ti­ga­tion to de­ter­mine whether the NOC is ful­fill­ing obli­ga­tion as per the Olympic char­ter.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lukashenko is strug­gling to con­tain nearly two months of street protests and more than 13,000 peo­ple have been ar­rested and many op­po­si­tion lead­ers jailed.</p>
    <p>In an­other sep­a­rate is­sue, World Ath­let­ics pres­i­dent Se­bas­tian Coe said com­peti­tors should be able to “take the knee” on the podium at the Tokyo Olympics, fol­low­ing an out­cry over moves to ban protests.</p>
    <p>A ban on demon­stra­tions at the Games, is­sued in Jan­uary, has come un­der ex­tra scru­tiny since the Black Lives Mat­ter move­ment flooded sports fol­low­ing the po­lice killing of un­armed black man Ge­orge Floyd in Min­neapo­lis in May.</p>
    <p>Coe told re­porters in Tokyo: “The ath­letes are a part of the world and they want to re­flect the world they live in.</p>
    <p>“And that is for me per­fectly ac­cept­able, as long as it is done with com­plete re­spect for other com­peti­tors, which I think most ath­letes prop­erly un­der­stand.”</p>
    <p>The IOC has hinted it may be will­ing to soften its stance and is back­ing dis­cus­sions led by the Olympic Ath­letes Com­mis­sion to con­sider ways of al­low­ing “dig­ni­fied” sup­port for anti-racism ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>FANS WEL­COME</p>
    <p>We are work­ing on the ba­sis of course there will be in­ter­na­tional spec­ta­tors in (Tokyo). What we do not know is if we can fill sta­dia to full ca­pac­ity or if other mea­sures would have to be ap­plied.</p>
    <p>THOMAS BACH, IOC pres­i­dent, on fan ar­range­ments in Tokyo next year.</p>
