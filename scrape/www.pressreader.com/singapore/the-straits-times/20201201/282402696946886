    <p>•</p>
    <p>BUENOS AIRES Diego Maradona’s per­sonal doc­tor has de­nied re­spon­si­bil­ity for the Ar­gen­tinian le­gend’s death af­ter po­lice raided his house and clinic on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“I feel ter­ri­ble be­cause my friend has died,” Leopoldo Luque told re­porters at his Buenos Aires home.</p>
    <p>“I’m not the one who is re­spon­si­ble for all of this. I know what I did with Diego and I know how I did it. I can ex­plain it all. I’m ab­so­lutely cer­tain I did the best that could have been done for Diego.”</p>
    <p>Po­lice seized lap­tops, med­i­cal records and mo­bile de­vices dur­ing the three-hour raid, part of a probe to de­ter­mine whether there was neg­li­gence on the part of the physi­cian. The search was or­dered by a judge fol­low­ing pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions, which in­cluded ev­i­dence from Maradona’s daugh­ters, Jana, Dalma and Gian­nina.</p>
    <p>It was the lat­est soap-oper­atic turn since Maradona died aged 60 last Wed­nes­day, plung­ing the coun­try into three days of na­tional mourn­ing. Less than a month af­ter un­der­go­ing surgery to re­move a blood clot in his brain, the 1986 World Cup win­ner suf­fered a fa­tal heart at­tack at his home in Ti­gre, just north of the cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>De­spite well-pub­li­cised health is­sues, Maradona’s death caught many by sur­prise. Con­spir­acy the­o­ries, scan­dals and sus­pi­cions of foul play have since emerged.</p>
    <p>Al­though the for­mer Barcelona and Napoli star died in his sleep, his lawyer, Ma­tias Morla, claimed that an am­bu­lance took more than half an hour to ar­rive.</p>
    <p>Call­ing it “crim­i­nal id­iocy”, he has re­quested a probe into the death, al­though pros­e­cu­tors have dis­puted that timeline, say­ing the am­bu­lance ar­rived in 12 min­utes.</p>
    <p>An­other of Maradona’s for­mer doc­tors, Al­fredo Cahe, also felt his death was “un­usual,” in­sist­ing a med­i­cal pro­fes­sional should have been sta­tioned in his room and that the for­mer Ar­gentina skip­per should have stayed in the hos­pi­tal af­ter his op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>But Luque dis­puted that al­le­ga­tion, adding that no one could force Maradona to stay in the hos­pi­tal against his will. He also said he had co­op­er­ated with law en­force­ment and was ready to an­swer any ques­tions from pros­e­cu­tors.</p>
    <p>“You want to know what I am re­spon­si­ble for? For hav­ing loved him, for hav­ing taken care of him, for hav­ing ex­tended his life, for hav­ing im­proved it to the end,” Luque said, re­veal­ing Maradona was not un­der his care af­ter he was dis­charged on Nov 12.</p>
    <p>“If you ask me, I’m a neu­ro­sur­geon and my job ended. I was done with him. He (Maradona) should have gone to a re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion cen­tre. He didn’t want to.”</p>
    <p>Luque also painted a pic­ture of a pa­tient who was “very dif­fi­cult” and “kicked me out of his house many times” and had to be con­vinced to take care of his health.</p>
    <p>Ar­gentina’s state news agency Te­lam said in­ves­ti­ga­tors were try­ing to es­tab­lish if Maradona had re­ceived 24-hour care from med­i­cal staff in the days be­fore his death, one of the con­di­tions of his dis­charge from hos­pi­tal.</p>
