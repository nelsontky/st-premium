    <p>Back in early April, dur­ing that brief phase when lock­down felt more like an un­ex­plored alien planet than the in­escapable traf­fic jam it soon be­came, I called Ja­pan’s big­gest karaoke op­er­a­tors to see what they made of it all.</p>
    <p>Prin­ci­pally, I wanted to know what sort of tech they planned to throw at a prob­lem that, on an early read­ing, seemed des­tined to put them all out of busi­ness.</p>
    <p>There was, I now re­alise, some­thing vis­ceral about those calls. It was not that, within a cou­ple of weeks, the karaoke pangs of friends and con­tacts were over­pow­er­ing. And it wasn’t that the plight of Ja­pan’s tens of thou­sands of karaoke es­tab­lish­ments par­tic­u­larly stood out in a cri­sis that forced favourite bars and restau­rants to close and caused the whole Japanese econ­omy to shrink a record</p>
    <p>7.8 per cent in that very quar­ter.</p>
    <p>It was, rather, an ar­ti­cle of geeky faith – an in­nate con­fi­dence that karaoke’s sur­vival in­stincts would pro­pel it to­wards in­no­va­tion ahead of ev­ery­body else.</p>
    <p>If any­thing was go­ing to find a way for tech to re­open its doors, surely it would be a seg­ment of the leisure in­dus­try whose en­tire 50-year-old busi­ness model has in­volved pil­ing ever more se­duc­tive lay­ers of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion (voice as­sis­tance, calo­rie coun­ters, com­pet­i­tive note-hit­ting gauges) on what is es­sen­tially a camp­fire sin­ga­long.</p>
    <p>My calls to karaoke ma­jors, ask­ing what sort of plans they were hatch­ing, were in all in­stances met with a grumpy “don’t know”. But my faith was re­warded a few months later, with what karaoke now hopes will be its tech res­cue</p>
    <p>package: tweaks to its in­fra­struc­ture aimed at mak­ing pub­lic singing coro­n­avirus-safe.</p>
    <p>Some of these have been rel­a­tively straight­for­ward.</p>
    <p>The large chains have in­tro­duced apps that turn your smart­phone into a re­mote con­trol to avoid touch­ing com­mu­nal but­tons or screens. An­other up­grade</p>
    <p>syn­chro­nises and scrolls the lyrics on your phone, should so­cial dis­tanc­ing mean you are sit­ting too far from the screen to read the words prop­erly.</p>
    <p>Some chains al­low the re­ally ner­vous self-iso­la­tor to sing alone in a room in their es­tab­lish­ment but be linked on­line to any other rooms in their na­tion­wide net­work to</p>
    <p>form a vir­tual group.</p>
    <p>Ar­guably the most help­ful of all in terms of coax­ing peo­ple back to the mi­cro­phone has been Joysound’s flag­ship of­fer­ing: A se­ries of set­tings that ad­just the tone and clar­ity of your out­put to com­pen­sate for singing through a mask.</p>
    <p>And all of this has been pur­sued with dou­ble ur­gency. The tech race</p>
    <p>here has not just been about find­ing ways to limit the virus’ threat long enough to tempt pun­ters back into the rooms and through their song lists, but about main­tain­ing cus­tomers’ loy­alty to the idea of singing with friends in a small room be­fore they per­ma­nently opt for some­thing more home-based.</p>
    <p>As this cri­sis has done with so many gen­res of en­ter­tain­ment, lock­downs or vol­un­tary stints at home have re­vealed vi­able – of­ten sur­pris­ingly at­trac­tive – al­ter­na­tives to what we were used to.</p>
    <p>Ama­zon’s Twitch Sings app, for in­stance, ef­fec­tively puts the user in a vir­tual, global karaoke room wher­ever they hap­pen to be, and its use has surged. The joy pro­duced by lip-sync­ing on TikTok and shar­ing with friends has, for many, pro­duced a pass­able anal­ogy to the fun of a US$40 (S$55) ses­sion at a karaoke box.</p>
    <p>Karaoke’s haste, at least in Ja­pan, has been to show that these are al­ter­na­tives to what it pro­vides, rather than re­place­ments.</p>
    <p>But, as ever, the most in­trigu­ing as­pect of tech in­no­va­tion has been what it re­veals about us, the con­sumers, or in this case about us as in­di­vid­ual nav­i­ga­tors of a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>For all the uni­ver­sal­ity of the threat posed by Covid-19, the fo­cus of the pub­lic’s re­sponse has var­ied widely around the world.</p>
    <p>For Ja­pan, part of the pro­tec­tive dogma has been the idea that the virus is spread most per­ni­ciously when peo­ple speak loudly or shout.</p>
    <p>A coro­n­avirus-era bar has al­ready opened in Shin­juku, where cus­tomers drink, or­der and so­cialise in a si­lence bro­ken by only the sound of them writ­ing ev­ery­thing down with pencil and pa­per.</p>
    <p>Two of the karaoke in­no­va­tions – a but­ton you can press to pro­duce dozens of va­ri­eties of ap­plause and a fa­cil­ity to write en­tire con­ver­sa­tions di­rectly onto the main screen – have been crafted to satisfy this credo that, apart from the per­son with the mi­cro­phone, karaoke un­der Covid-19 is about keep­ing your mouth shut.</p>

The tweaks aim to be al&#xAD;ter&#xAD;na&#xAD;tives to what these places pro&#xAD;vide, rather than re&#xAD;place&#xAD;ments.</p>
