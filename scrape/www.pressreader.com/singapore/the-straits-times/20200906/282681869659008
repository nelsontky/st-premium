    <p>March 21 - April 19</p>
    <p>You need to deal with a chal­lenge that may cause more prob­lems than you re­alise. Things are fine, but your en­ergy needs to be fo­cused on this ob­sta­cle so you can move for­ward.</p>
    <p>April 20 - May 20</p>
    <p>Your abil­ity to get things done is tested, but you should find you can count on your great en­ergy to push you through to the fin­ish line. It is a great time to help oth­ers get things done.</p>
    <p>May 21 - June 20</p>
    <p>Your hid­den tal­ents are com­ing into play, so make the most of them and en­sure all goes well for you and your peo­ple. Things may yet turn the cor­ner, but you have to work to make it hap­pen.</p>
    <p>June 21 - July 22</p>
    <p>You have to make the first move.</p>
    <p>That may not feel quite right, but as long as you are com­mit­ted to ac­tion, why should you not be the one to get the ball rolling? Ini­tia­tive pays off.</p>
    <p>July 23 - Aug 22</p>
    <p>It is way too easy for you to take on too much for one per­son. That could mean any­thing from work pro­jects to bak­ing to party in­vi­ta­tions, so make sure you say no at some point.</p>
    <p>Aug 23 - Sept 22</p>
    <p>Speak out – you are in the right, but you have to let oth­ers know where you stand if you want to make any head­way. For­tu­nately, your ter­rific per­sonal en­ergy helps you speak from the heart.</p>
    <p>Sept 23 - Oct 22</p>
    <p>You need to avoid any­thing that could bring you down, as things are heavy enough as it is. It is one of those days when you are feel­ing se­ri­ous about one big is­sue – and that is plenty for now.</p>
    <p>Oct 23 - Nov 21</p>
    <p>You are the pri­mary force in the day’s ac­tiv­i­ties, whether you know it or not. Your en­ergy makes the dif­fer­ence be­tween suc­cess and fail­ure for you and your peo­ple, so take this se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>Nov 22 - Dec 21</p>
    <p>You need to tackle mun­dane tasks, even if you would rather take the world by storm. There will be plenty of time for that later, as you have to get the de­tails straight be­fore you can be ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>Dec 22 - Jan 19</p>
    <p>Go ahead and in­dulge your­self, even if it feels as though you are be­hav­ing too child­ishly. That just means you are on the right track, as play and fun are the key­words of the day.</p>
    <p>Jan 20 - Feb 18</p>
    <p>You have a lot to learn from the past, de­spite your in­cli­na­tion to face the fu­ture. It is one of those days when you should lis­ten when peo­ple talk about past chal­lenges. Learn from ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>Feb 19 - March 20</p>
    <p>Your abil­ity to reach other peo­ple is height­ened, so make the most of it and write a note or tell some­one off at work. You should make a pos­i­tive dif­fer­ence with ease.</p>
