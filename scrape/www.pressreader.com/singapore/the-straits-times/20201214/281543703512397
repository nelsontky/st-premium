    <p>‘ Tis the sea­son… to re­deem $100 worth of tourism vouch­ers and open the door to dis­cov­ery. This month, Sin­ga­pore­ans aged 18 and above will re­ceive their dig­i­tal Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers Vouch­ers to spend on lo­cal at­trac­tions, ho­tel stays and tours.</p>
    <p>The vouch­ers can be used with five au­tho­rised book­ing part­ners: Changi Travel Ser­vices (also known as Changi Recommends), Glob­alTix, Klook, Trip.com and Trav­eloka.</p>
    <p>Be­fore you get started, here are some things to note.</p>
    <p>Why can’t the Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers Vouch­ers be in phys­i­cal form?</p>
    <p>The dig­i­tal Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers Vouch­ers are de­signed to be safe and easy-to-use.</p>
    <p>The on­line re­demp­tion process al­lows the vouch­ers to be dis­trib­uted quickly to most peo­ple with­out the need for phys­i­cal queues.</p>
    <p>The pre-book­ing of prod­ucts and ser­vices on­line through the five au­tho­rised book­ing part­ners also al­lows mer­chants to en­sure that they are able to man­age de­mand ahead of time, re­duc­ing the chances of crowd­ing and phys­i­cal in­ter­ac­tion that may oc­cur if ev­ery­one re­deemed their vouch­ers in per­son.</p>
    <p>Also, us­ing paper vouch­ers may not be as se­cure due to the risk of fraud or theft.</p>
    <p>To use the vouch­ers, log in to your SingPass ac­count to au­then­ti­cate your iden­tity. You can then browse the web­sites of the au­tho­rised book­ing part­ners for what in­ter­ests you. These are marked “el­i­gi­ble for Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers Vouch­ers” or have the Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers Vouch­ers icon.</p>
    <p>Once you have added your items to the shop­ping cart, click “Use Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers Vouch­ers” at the check­out page to pay.</p>
    <p>Next, log in with SingPass to se­lect the voucher amount to use. You will re­ceive a gen­er­ated voucher code. Copy and paste the code on the check­out page.</p>
    <p>This process pro­vides added se­cu­rity by re­duc­ing the risk of fraud or theft.</p>
    <p>Need help go­ing on­line? You can visit one of 69 phys­i­cal book­ing coun­ters set up is­land­wide by the au­tho­rised book­ing part­ners. They pro­vide per­son­alised as­sis­tance and are lo­cated in ev­ery Hous­ing Board (HDB) town, and in­side or within a five-minute walk of a com­mu­nity cen­tre or club (CC).</p>
    <p>You will need to have your SingPass lo­gin de­tails ready. En­sure that you also have your mo­bile phone and one of the ac­cepted modes of pay­ment — cash, Nets card or credit card — when you visit the coun­ters to make your book­ings.</p>
    <p>All Sin­ga­pore­ans are strongly en­cour­aged to re­deem their vouch­ers on­line and to as­sist fam­ily and friends who need help with on­line re­demp­tion.</p>
    <p>Why can’t I com­bine my Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers Vouch­ers with those of my fam­ily or friends?</p>
    <p>The vouch­ers are for Sin­ga­pore­ans to sup­port busi­nesses in the tourism sec­tor as well as liveli­hoods badly af­fected by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Al­low­ing peo­ple to com­bine their vouch­ers may de­feat this pur­pose as it lim­its the scheme’s ben­e­fits to a smaller pool of busi­nesses. This is why com­bin­ing and trans­fer­ring of vouch­ers are not al­lowed.</p>
    <p>price jack­ing doesn’t take place?</p>
    <p>Safe­guards are in place to pre­vent price jack­ing — when a seller in­flates the prices of goods, ser­vices or commoditie­s to an un­rea­son­ably higher level — and prof­i­teer­ing.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the five au­tho­rised book­ing part­ners do not charge mer­chants on­board­ing or marketing fees. The book­ing part­ners have also com­mit­ted to lower-than-av­er­age com­mis­sion rates to help mer­chants keep their costs low.</p>
    <p>Mer­chants and book­ing part­ners do prac­tise dy­namic pric­ing, which de­pends on var- ous fac­tors such as sea­sonal pric­ing and busi­ness mod­els. For ex­am­ple, prices may be higher dur­ing peak pe­ri­ods such as school hol­i­days and fes­tive sea­sons.</p>
    <p>To en­joy bet­ter deals, Sin­ga­pore­ans should book their prod­ucts for use dur­ing off-peak sea­sons.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) takes a se­ri­ous view of un­eth­i­cal busi­ness prac­tices such as price and com­mis­sion hikes and price dump­ing. Price dump­ing is the act of charg­ing cus­tomers a lower price or below mar­ket value.</p>
    <p>It will mon­i­tor the prices of prod­ucts that Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers Vouch­ers can be used for and im­pose penal­ties on er­rant mer­chants and au­tho­rised book­ing part­ners. Those found guilty may be re­moved from the Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers Vouch­ers scheme.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic can re­port sus­pected un­eth­i­cal busi­ness prac­tices to ethics@stb.gov.sg</p>
    <p>The prices of some prod­ucts un­der the Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers Vouch­ers scheme seem to be higher than usual. How can we en­sure that</p>
