    <p>A new la­belling scheme to in­di­cate the cyber se­cu­rity lev­els of home de­vices has been launched here, with plans to have the stan­dards adopted at the in­ter­na­tional level.</p>
    <p>The Cy­ber­se­cu­rity La­belling Scheme (CLS) will be sim­i­lar to en­ergy la­bels, with a tiered ref­er­ence to se­cu­rity lev­els to help con­sumers make in­formed de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>The vol­un­tary scheme was launched yes­ter­day at the Asean Min­is­te­rial Con­fer­ence on Cy­ber­se­cu­rity – held as part of the fifth Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Cyber Week – at Ma­rina Bay Sands.</p>
    <p>Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion Min­is­ter S. Iswaran said at the event that the scheme will strengthen cyber se­cu­rity around Sin­ga­pore’s In­ter­net of Things (IoT), and could raise the global se­cu­rity stan­dards of IoT de­vices. IoT refers to phys­i­cal de­vices linked to one an­other and the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>“The scheme is the first of its kind in the Asia-Pa­cific. It es­tab­lishes cyber se­cu­rity rating lev­els for reg­is­tered smart de­vices, such as home routers and smart home hubs,” said Mr Iswaran, who is also Min­is­ter-in­charge of Cy­ber­se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>“Man­u­fac­tur­ers of IoT de­vices can vol­un­tar­ily ap­ply for the CLS.”</p>
    <p>The Cyber Se­cu­rity Agency of Sin­ga­pore (CSA) will be ad­min­is­ter­ing the la­bel, which was in­tro­duced ear­lier this year. The agency is waiv­ing ap­pli­ca­tion fees for the first year to en­cour­age adop­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Iswaran said the Gov­ern­ment in­tends to use the la­bel to raise the se­cu­rity stan­dards of prod­ucts not only in Sin­ga­pore, but also in­ter­na­tion­ally. “With the la­bels, con­sumers can eas­ily as­sess the level of se­cu­rity of each de­vice and make in­formed pur­chas­ing choices,” he said.</p>
    <p>“CSA plans to work with Asean mem­ber states and other in­ter­na­tional part­ners to es­tab­lish mu­tual recog­ni­tion ar­range­ments for the CLS, to en­hance se­cu­rity stan­dards of the global IoT de­vice mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>From smart speak­ers to high-tech light bulbs to ro­bot vac­uum clean­ers, IoT de­vices are ex­pected to surge in pop­u­lar­ity.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket re­search firm Gart­ner has es­ti­mated that IoT de­vices in use will grow from 8.4 bil­lion glob­ally in 2017 to 20.4 bil­lion this year, with twice as many con­sumer in­stal­la­tions as in­dus­trial ones.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s cyber se­cu­rity la­belling scheme fol­lows the Euro­pean Union’s stan­dard for IoT de­vices, which spells out the min­i­mum stan­dards for man­u­fac­tur­ers to meet, in­clud­ing hav­ing no de­fault pass­words and en­sur­ing that there are reg­u­lar soft­ware up­dates over the air with­out user su­per­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is among the first group of na­tions to adopt such a stan­dard.</p>
    <p>There are four lev­els in the scheme, each rep­re­sented by an as­ter­isk. In or­der to pass the stan­dards for the first two lev­els, man­u­fac­tur­ers need to sub­mit a dec­la­ra­tion of com­pli­ance along with sup­port­ing ev­i­dence. For the two higher lev­els, they will need to sub­mit an as­sess­ment report by a lab­o­ra­tory ap­proved by CSA.</p>
    <p>The agency started ac­cept­ing ap­pli­ca­tions for the la­bel yes­ter­day. The la­bels will first be rolled out to Wi-Fi routers and smart home hubs, due to their wide use and po­ten­tial se­cu­rity risks.</p>
    <p>Mr Ron­nie Lee, gen­eral man­ager of Len­ovo Sin­ga­pore, said the firm plans to ap­ply the CLS to its IoT de­vices, adding that the scheme comes at a good time, with cus­tomers be­com­ing in­creas­ingly con­cerned about cyber se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>“It will ben­e­fit cus­tomers, who can now make in­formed de­ci­sions on which de­vices to pur­chase, de­pend­ing on the dif­fer­ent se­cu­rity lev­els they may re­quire,” he said.</p>
