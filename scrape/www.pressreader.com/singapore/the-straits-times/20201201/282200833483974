    <p>About 1,250 tech­ni­cians from Shell will ben­e­fit from a new coun­cil that will help up­skill them for fu­ture roles.</p>
    <p>The Joint Ca­pa­bil­ity Coun­cil, launched yes­ter­day, is a part­ner­ship be­tween the Sin­ga­pore Shell Em­ploy­ees’ Union and Shell.</p>
    <p>This is in line with Shell’s plan to re­pur­pose its core busi­ness in oil and gas and cut car­bon diox­ide emis­sions in Sin­ga­pore by about a third within a decade, the com­pany said.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil will iden­tify and equip staff with rel­e­vant skills for the fu­ture – such as dig­i­tal lit­er­acy, data an­a­lyt­ics and adap­tive skills.</p>
    <p>Shell’s Pu­lau Bukom re­fin­ery will pivot from a crude oil, fu­els-based prod­uct slate to­wards cleaner en­ergy fu­els and so­lu­tions. Its work­force will be down­sized from 1,300 now to 800 over the next three years, as the re­fin­ery is re­struc­tured to in­clude dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and au­toma­tion of its op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>This is part of par­ent com­pany Royal Dutch Shell’s plan to be­come a net-zero emis­sions en­ergy busi­ness by 2050.</p>
    <p>The first phase will of­fer train­ing pro­grammes to over 500 process and main­te­nance tech­ni­cians.</p>
    <p>Shell said in a me­dia re­lease: “(This) will com­ple­ment Shell’s dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion ef­forts in piv­ot­ing its man­u­fac­tur­ing busi­ness into new, low­car­bon value chains... help­ing the work­force stay rel­e­vant and re­silient through change.”</p>
    <p>The sign­ing of the part­ner­ship was wit­nessed at Pu­lau Bukom yes­ter­day by union ad­viser Vi­vian Balakrishn­an, who also toured the premises with Na­tional Trades Union Congress sec­re­tary-gen­eral Ng Chee Meng.</p>
    <p>Call­ing Covid-19 a cat­a­lyst, Dr Balakrishn­an, who is also Min­is­ter for For­eign Af­fairs, said the pan­demic has led to “an ac­cel­er­a­tion of pre­ex­ist­ing trends... (like) dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and au­toma­tion. And this, in fact, will be a source of com­pet­i­tive strength”.</p>
    <p>He added: “It has also clearly un­der­scored the ur­gent need for all of us to be life­long learn­ers and to be open all the time to train­ing and up­skilling our­selves.”</p>
    <p>The new coun­cil will be an im­por­tant en­abler in Shell’s trans­for­ma­tion, push­ing work­ers to take on higher-value jobs and al­low­ing for a holis­tic dis­cus­sion around skills up­grad­ing and ca­reer pro­gres­sion, Dr Balakrishn­an noted.</p>
    <p>“We are now at an­other turn­ing point, and en­ergy sources, trans­porta­tion, con­nec­tiv­ity, com­mu­ni­ca­tion... are all be­ing trans­formed.</p>
    <p>“And if we don’t again po­si­tion our­selves in the right time and the right place, with the right work­force and right skills, we are go­ing to miss out.”</p>
    <p>Shell Com­pa­nies in Sin­ga­pore chair­man Aw Kah Peng said: “As we re­pur­pose our busi­ness... Shell is also strength­en­ing the cul­ture of a ‘learner mind­set’.</p>
    <p>“This will help us to in­no­vate and not be afraid to try new things.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ng added that with this ini­tia­tive, staff “can have a for­mal struc­ture to en­able con­tin­u­ous learn­ing to fu­ture-proof them­selves”.</p>
    <p>“The coun­cil will make a real dif­fer­ence in en­hanc­ing their job se­cu­rity and se­cur­ing bet­ter work prospects in the medium to long term.”</p>
    <p>One of the po­ten­tial ben­e­fi­cia­ries of the ini­tia­tive is tech­ni­cian Lee Xue Ling, 37, a team leader in the util­i­ties pro­duc­tion unit. She has moved across sev­eral dif­fer­ent de­part­ments since join­ing Shell in 2006. Ms Lee com­pleted a part­time diploma pro­gramme in chem­i­cal en­gi­neer­ing at Te­masek Polytech­nic in 2015, and signed up re­cently for a Python cod­ing course.</p>
    <p>“I was given the op­por­tu­nity to move around Shell and that keeps my job in­ter­est­ing. When I keep learn­ing, I find that I al­ways have pas­sion and in­ter­est in my job.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery day is a new learn­ing op­por­tu­nity for me.”</p>
    <p>AN­OTHER TURN­ING POINT</p>
    <p>We are now at an­other turn­ing point, and en­ergy sources, trans­porta­tion, con­nec­tiv­ity, com­mu­ni­ca­tion... are all be­ing trans­formed. And if we don’t again po­si­tion our­selves in the right time and the right place, with the right work­force and right skills, we are go­ing to ’’ miss out.</p>
