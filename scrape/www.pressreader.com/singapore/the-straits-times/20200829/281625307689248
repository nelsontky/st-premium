    <p>Dubai-based ground-han­dling firm dnata yes­ter­day re­trenched work­ers in Sin­ga­pore as the Covid-19 pan­demic took a toll on the firm’s op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to work­ers, the firm may have laid off more than 100 em­ploy­ees. It did not con­firm the fig­ure when asked, and the Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) de­clined to comment on how many union mem­bers were af­fected in the re­trench­ment ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>dnata em­ploys more than 1,800 peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore and has been op­er­at­ing here for 50 years, ac­cord­ing to its web­site.</p>
    <p>Re­trenched work­ers said they were taken by sur­prise.</p>
    <p>A Sin­ga­porean worker in her 60s, who had worked at the firm for more than three decades, said: “I cried be­cause I have worked there for so long and my col­leagues are like sis­ters and broth­ers to me.”</p>
    <p>An­other worker, also in her 60s, said she sus­pected she would be laid off when she saw her name was miss­ing from the list of du­ties in an e-mail sent to staff each morn­ing. Her fears were con­firmed when her su­per­vi­sor asked her to go to the hu­man re­sources depart­ment. “Be­fore I found out, I felt sad for my col­leagues who were af­fected be­cause they were good work­ers. I didn’t re­alise I would be laid off too.”</p>
    <p>Both em­ploy­ees de­clined to be named for fear of reper­cus­sions.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has caused un­prece­dented dis­rup­tion to global trade and in­dus­try, and dev­as­tated the avi­a­tion and travel sec­tors.</p>
    <p>A dnata spokesman said: “The sit­u­a­tion re­mains very fluid with un­pre­dictable demand, sched­ule and ca­pac­ity changes be­com­ing the norm. Con­sid­er­ing this op­er­at­ing en­vi­ron­ment, and like so many other or­gan­i­sa­tions in Sin­ga­pore that have been im­pacted, we’ve had to take steps to right-size our busi­ness and en­sure it is fit for pur­pose.”</p>
    <p>He said the firm has worked closely with the union and gov­ern­ment agen­cies and is com­ply­ing with the Gov­ern­ment’s tri­par­tite ad­vi­sory on re­trench­ments. The firm will have a larger pro­por­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans af­ter the re­trench­ment ex­er­cise, he said, go­ing up from 63 per cent of dnata’s work­force in Sin­ga­pore to 73 per cent af­ter the lay­offs.</p>
    <p>The spokesman said the com­pany has en­gaged the dnata Sin­ga­pore Staff Union and NTUC’s Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute (e2i) to share in­for­ma­tion on job va­can­cies and up­com­ing job fairs, as well as fa­cil­i­tate in­di­vid­ual ca­reer coach­ing ses­sions for af­fected em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>dnata Sin­ga­pore Staff Union pres­i­dent Sheikh Muhammed said it is a dif­fi­cult time, es­pe­cially for those work­ing in avi­a­tion and its supporting in­dus­tries. “While ef­forts have been made to pro­tect jobs and liveli­hoods, we un­der­stand that the com­pany is fac­ing ex­tremely chal­leng­ing times and has lit­tle choice but to right-size. We stand in sol­i­dar­ity with our fel­low work­ers and will do ev­ery­thing we can to help them dur­ing this dif­fi­cult time,” he said.</p>
    <p>NTUC as­sis­tant direc­tor-gen­eral and e2i chief ex­ec­u­tive Gilbert Tan said e2i will en­gage af­fected work­ers to share suit­able job op­por­tu­ni­ties with them and pro­vide ac­cess to re­sources such as ca­reer con­sul­ta­tion and em­ploy­a­bil­ity work­shops.</p>
    <p>He said: “We strive to be a step ahead to pro­tect work­ers’ liveli­hoods by match­ing them to the jobs gath­ered by the NTUC Job Se­cu­rity Coun­cil. To make this work, we urge com­pa­nies to come for­ward, to work with us so that work­ers can find jobs prior to any re­trench­ment should it be un­avoid­able.”</p>
