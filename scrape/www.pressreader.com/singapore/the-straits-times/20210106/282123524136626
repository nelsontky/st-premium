    <p>The coun­sel for a woman who claimed the law did not ap­ply to her when told to wear a mask in pub­lic amid the coro­n­avirus out­break has asked for the case to be ad­journed to a later date.</p>
    <p>Lawyer Anil Singh Sandhu told District Judge Adam Nakhoda yes­ter­day that he will be ex­pe­dit­ing the mat­ter, adding that he has ar­ranged to meet his 41-year-old client, Param­jeet Kaur, this Fri­day to ob­tain her po­si­tion on the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Kaur’s case has been ad­journed to Jan 26.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean woman made head­lines last May af­ter a video clip cir­cu­lated on­line in which she claimed to be a “sov­er­eign” dur­ing a heated ar­gu­ment when con­fronted by passers-by at Shunfu Mart near Up­per Thom­son Road.</p>
    <p>“It means I have noth­ing to do with the po­lice, it means I have no con­tract with the po­lice. They have no say over me,” she is heard say­ing in the video.</p>
    <p>A man, who is off screen, re­sponds: “This doesn’t even make any sense. If you’re a per­son in Sin­ga­pore, you have to fol­low the rules of Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>But Kaur is heard re­ply­ing: “That’s the thing – I’m not a per­son, I’m ‘we the peo­ple’.”</p>
    <p>She was ar­rested on May 4 last year and ap­peared in court the next day.</p>
    <p>She was later charged with of­fences in­clud­ing fail­ure to wear a mask over her nose and mouth when vis­it­ing a food stall in Up­per Thom­son Road at around 9.20pm on April 30 last year.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese-lan­guage evening pa­per Lianhe Wan­bao had ear­lier quoted a woman, who iden­ti­fied her­self as Kaur’s mother, as say­ing that her daugh­ter was a phys­io­ther­a­pist who lived in Aus­tralia for 20 years be­fore re­turn­ing to Sin­ga­pore in 2019.</p>
    <p>Last May, Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam said in a Face­book post that he had tried to find out what Kaur might have meant by claim­ing to be “sov­er­eign”.</p>
    <p>He said then: “There is a move­ment in the United States, and ad­her­ents to that move­ment, (broadly speak­ing) re­ject gov­ern­ment, re­ject the po­lice and any kind of au­thor­ity...</p>
    <p>“Such peo­ple should not live within so­ci­ety – she should not ex­pect any of the ben­e­fits that come from this sys­tem of gov­er­nance, in­clud­ing her se­cu­rity, med­i­cal care, other ben­e­fits.”</p>
    <p>For fail­ing to wear a mask over the nose and mouth, a first-time of­fender can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $10,000.</p>
    <p>Re­peat of­fend­ers can be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $20,000.</p>
