    <p>MEL­BOURNE • One would think that koalas are easy to find – and count – be­cause they are large, fluffy and mostly im­mo­bile since they are prone to sleep for about 20 hours a day. Not so.</p>
    <p>“It’s the fact that they don’t move much that makes them hard to spot,” said Dr Des­ley Whisson, a wildlife ecol­o­gist at Deakin Univer­sity in Victoria.</p>
    <p>This makes the Aus­tralian gov­ern­ment’s ef­fort to count the pop­u­la­tion of the iconic mar­su­pi­als and record where they live all the more daunt­ing.</p>
    <p>Last month, the gov­ern­ment not only an­nounced it was com­mit­ting A$2 mil­lion (S$1.98 mil­lion) to fund an au­dit of the na­tive species, it would also use a host of new meth­ods to do so.</p>
    <p>When the count be­gins in a few months, heat-seek­ing drones, acous­tic sur­veys and de­tec­tor dogs will be de­ployed.</p>
    <p>In­di­vid­u­als will don hik­ing boots and head out into the bush for some koala-spot­ting. Many will also look for koala drop­pings.</p>
    <p>Es­ti­mates of koala pop­u­la­tions have var­ied wildly.</p>
    <p>In 2016, sci­en­tists es­ti­mated that there were more than 300,000 koalas in Aus­tralia. Last year, the Aus­tralian Koala Foun­da­tion es­ti­mated that fewer than 80,000 re­mained in the coun­try, and said the num­ber could be as low as 43,000.</p>
    <p>Con­cern and con­fu­sion over the koalas’ num­bers in­ten­si­fied dur­ing Aus­tralia’s dev­as­tat­ing bush fires last year.</p>
    <p>More than 60,000 koalas were killed, in­jured or dis­placed in Aus­tralian bush fires last sum­mer, the World Wide Fund for Na­ture has es­ti­mated.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore the bush fires dec­i­mated koala pop­u­la­tions, there were grow­ing fears that the an­i­mals were in trou­ble.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists and con­ser­va­tion or­gan­i­sa­tions said the loss of habi­tat be­cause of land clear­ing is send­ing more koalas into ur­ban ar­eas where they are im­per­iled: get­ting flat­tened by cars and at­tacked by dogs.</p>
