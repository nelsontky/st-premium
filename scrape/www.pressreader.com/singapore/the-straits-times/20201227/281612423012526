    <p>The word re­ces­sion, un­til very re­cently, was re­garded by most as a piece of fi­nan­cial jar­gon.</p>
    <p>But this year it be­came a topic of din­ing table con­ver­sa­tion and may re­main one of the terms that will de­fine 2020 for a long time.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Google, the spike in Web searches for re­ces­sion started to take shape in mid-Fe­bru­ary – just three weeks af­ter China placed the cap­i­tal of its in­dus­trial heart­land, Wuhan, un­der quar­an­tine and nearly a month be­fore the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion declared Covid-19 a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>For econ­o­mists and pol­i­cy­mak­ers it was clear that a sprawl­ing lock­down in the world’s sec­ond­largest econ­omy would hurt global growth and hit its Asian neigh­bours the hardest.</p>
    <p>Health ex­perts dreaded the prospect of the dis­ease spread­ing be­yond China.</p>
    <p>For com­mon folk, the con­cerns over a pan­demic-driven re­ces­sion en­com­passed the threat both to their lives and their liveli­hoods.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore on Feb 17 down­graded its eco­nomic out­look, hint­ing at the pos­si­bil­ity of its first full-year re­ces­sion in decades.</p>
    <p>The fore­cast in March turned grim­mer, sug­gest­ing that the na­tion may suf­fer its worst re­ces­sion since in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>To­day, about 10 per cent of the global pop­u­la­tion may have been in­fected by the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>But there is hardly any­one on the globe that has been spared the rip­ple ef­fects of the eco­nomic down­turn, and the chaotic ad­just­ment to a pre­vi­ously un­think­able life­style and work en­vi­ron­ment trig­gered by the outbreak.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Labour Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s lat­est es­ti­mates show that 81 mil­lion jobs will be lost across the Asia-Pa­cific this year.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the un­em­ploy­ment rate stood at around 3.8 per cent in the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The UN agency be­lieves that the true ex­tent of job and in­come loss was hard to mea­sure dur­ing this par­tic­u­lar re­ces­sion as mil­lions more were sent on un­paid leave of ab­sence, salaries were cut and many more took tem­po­rary gigs.</p>
    <p>An­other usual method of count­ing the cost of a re­ces­sion is by as­sess­ing the drop in busi­ness and pri­vate spend­ing.</p>
    <p>But given that the re­ces­sion was trig­gered by the lock­down of busi­nesses, curbs on travel and mo­bil­ity re­stric­tions, it be­came im­pos­si­ble to know how much of the with­drawal in con­sump­tion was caused by fi­nan­cial dis­tress and how much was due to the fact that peo­ple and busi­nesses could not make de­sired pur­chases even if they had the money to do so.</p>
    <p>And that is why, even though there was noth­ing new about the word and the phe­nom­e­non it­self, there was quite a bit of dis­cus­sion on whether this par­tic­u­lar down­turn should be com­pared with pre­vi­ous re­ces­sions.</p>
    <p>The word re­ces­sion was first used in the 1640-1650 down­turn called the Gen­eral Crises that en­veloped most of Western Europe amid a wide­spread break­down in pol­i­tics, economics and so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>In the fol­low­ing years, there was not much of a con­sen­sus on the char­ac­ter­i­sa­tion of a re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>In 1974, a com­mis­sioner of the US Bureau of Labour Statis­tics, Pro­fes­sor Julius Shiskin, came up with a def­i­ni­tion for re­ces­sion that is preva­lent to this day.</p>
    <p>He de­fined it as two con­sec­u­tive quar­ters of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) de­clines.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Bureau of Eco­nomic Re­search (NBER) – a pri­vate, non-profit re­search group that tracks the start and end dates of busi­ness cy­cles in the United States – de­scribes a re­ces­sion as the pe­riod be­tween a peak of eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity and its sub­se­quent trough.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the NBER, ex­pan­sion is the nor­mal state of the econ­omy and most re­ces­sions are brief. That said, the time it takes for the econ­omy to re­turn to its pre­vi­ous trend path may be quite ex­tended.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the 2020 re­ces­sion did not re­ally fol­low a peak in eco­nomic growth for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s econ­omy grew by 0.7 per cent in 2019, the slow­est pace since 2009 when GDP ex­panded by 0.1 per cent.</p>
    <p>There were plenty of other economies world­wide that suf­fered a sim­i­lar fate.</p>
    <p>Thus, some econ­o­mists have in­sisted on call­ing the 2020 re­ces­sion the Great Lock­down Cri­sis, while oth­ers named it a health emer­gency or health se­cu­rity cri­sis. Those de­scrip­tions give a sense that the re­ces­sion is quite tem­po­rary and that a quick or V-shaped re­cov­ery is in the offing, helped by un­prece­dented in­jec­tions of fis­cal and mone­tary aid.</p>
    <p>How­ever, as de­scribed by the NBER, even as economies enter a pe­riod of ex­pan­sion it may take more time to re­cover all that was lost – jobs, cor­po­rate prof­itabil­ity and sta­bil­ity of per­sonal and na­tional fi­nances.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try ex­pects a full re­cov­ery will stretch through 2021, even though growth may have al­ready started to pick up.</p>
    <p>And for those who suf­fered the most in terms of fi­nan­cial dis­tress, the word re­ces­sion will re­main etched in their mem­o­ries for even longer.</p>
