    <p>• The Aus­tralian Open or­gan­is­ers have been forced to tear up a quar­an­tine ac­com­mo­da­tion plan for in­ter­na­tional play­ers a month be­fore the first Grand Slam of the year starts, af­ter apart­ment own­ers at a lux­ury ho­tel in Melbourne threat­ened le­gal ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Ten­nis Aus­tralia and gov­ern­ment au­thor­i­ties had ar­ranged for play­ers to serve a 14-day manda­tory quar­an­tine at the Westin Melbourne ahead of the Feb 8-21 hard-court Ma­jor.</p>
    <p>But the plan was yes­ter­day scrapped af­ter apart­ment own­ers at the hy­brid condo-ho­tel com­plained a day ear­lier they had not been prop­erly con­sulted and would seek an in­junc­tion against it.</p>
    <p>“Fol­low­ing con­sul­ta­tion be­tween the own­ers of The Westin Melbourne, the ho­tel’s ex­ist­ing res­i­dents and Covid-19 Quar­an­tine Vic­to­ria, the de­ci­sion has been made to ac­com­mo­date play­ers and their sup­port teams ar­riv­ing in Melbourne for the up­com­ing ATP (events) at an al­ter­nate ho­tel lo­ca­tion,” the Westin said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Graeme Efron, a lawyer rep­re­sent­ing the own­ers, told Reuters the quar­an­tine plan was “never go­ing to get through”.</p>
    <p>“It was the epit­ome of hubris that they thought peo­ple would go along with it with­out be­ing con­sulted,” he said.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional play­ers at the Aus­tralian Open are ex­pected to ar­rive in Melbourne from the mid­dle of this month and Vic­to­ria Po­lice Min­is­ter Lisa Neville told re­porters yes­ter­day that an al­ter­na­tive quar­an­tine ho­tel had been se­cured for the play­ers, which would be “stood up to­day or to­mor­row”.</p>
    <p>Many of the world’s top play­ers are plan­ning to com­pete at tour­na­ments at Melbourne Park in the week be­fore the Slam.</p>
    <p>Melbourne was the epi­cen­tre of Aus­tralia’s largest sec­ond-wave out­break of Covid-19, which started at two quar­an­tine ho­tels for in­ter­na­tional ar­rivals.</p>
    <p>More than 18,000 in­fec­tions were recorded in the state dur­ing the out­break, lead­ing to nearly 800 deaths. Vic­to­ria recorded four new cases in Melbourne yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing one in ho­tel quar­an­tine. Aus­tralia has re­ported just over 28,500 coro­n­avirus cases and 909 deaths in to­tal.</p>
