    <p>Mil­len­nium Ho­tels and Re­sorts will cut 159 jobs – or 15.2 per cent of its head­count here – as part of a re­view of its lo­cal of­fice and ho­tel op­er­a­tions amid the pan­demic-in­duced down­turn.</p>
    <p>“This is a dif­fi­cult but in­evitable move,” said a com­pany state­ment yes­ter­day. “The global pan­demic and eco­nomic fall­out have hit the ho­tels hard.”</p>
    <p>It noted yes­ter­day that about one-third of the com­pany’s ho­tels glob­ally are tem­po­rar­ily closed, while “those that re­mained open were op­er­at­ing at much lower oc­cu­pan­cies than be­fore”.</p>
    <p>The down­turn has hit op­er­a­tions and per­for­mance hard, added the firm, which has al­ready tight­ened ex­pen­di­ture across the com­pany, in­clud­ing re­duc­ing salaries for se­nior man­age­ment by up to 30 per cent.</p>
    <p>The re­trench­ments will af­fect a higher per­cent­age of for­eign­ers com­pared with Sin­ga­pore­ans, the com­pany state­ment said.</p>
    <p>The lat­est re­trench­ments come after the num­ber of for­eign em­ploy­ees in the com­pany had been cut from 520 to 329 since Jan­uary – a re­duc­tion of 37 per cent. The lay­offs an­nounced yes­ter­day in­clude the ax­ing of a fur­ther 42 for­eign staff.</p>
    <p>“This will bring our Sin­ga­pore core from 61 per cent in Jan­uary to 69 per cent,” the firm said.</p>
    <p>The group has six ho­tels here: Or­chard Ho­tel Sin­ga­pore in Or­chard Road, Grand Copthorne Water­front Ho­tel and Copthorne King’s Ho­tel in Have­lock Road, M Ho­tel in An­son Road, and Stu­dio M Ho­tel and M So­cial Sin­ga­pore in Robert­son Quay.</p>
    <p>It is the global brand of Mil­len­nium & Copthorne Ho­tels Lim­ited, a wholly owned sub­sidiary of City De­vel­op­ments Lim­ited.</p>
    <p>Food, Drinks and Al­lied Work­ers Union gen­eral sec­re­tary Tan Hock Soon said the union had been work­ing with Mil­len­nium Ho­tels and Re­sorts “to im­ple­ment cost-sav­ing mea­sures, com­pris­ing re­design­ing of jobs, train­ing and re­de­ploy­ing of work­ers, and car­ry­ing out group-wide wage re­duc­tion”.</p>
    <p>He added that the salaries of work­ers earn­ing below $4,600 have also been pro­tected, with no wage cuts to date.</p>
    <p>The com­pany will pro­vide “el­i­gi­ble rep­re­sented work­ers with a retrenchme­nt ben­e­fit of one month per year of ser­vice, ad­vance no­tice or salary in lieu of no­tice as pro­vided for un­der the col­lec­tive agree­ments”, Mr Tan said.</p>
    <p>He added that the union “is grate­ful that the com­pany con­tin­ued to hon­our the col­lec­tive agree­ments for this group of work­ers”.</p>
    <p>Mil­len­nium Ho­tels and Re­sorts said it plans to use part of the Govern­ment’s wage sub­sidy scheme for Sin­ga­pore­ans to in­vest in its tal­ent pool as the econ­omy con­tin­ues to re­cover.</p>
    <p>Mr John Tan, its vice-pres­i­dent of hu­man re­sources for South-east Asia, said the busi­ness “will take time to re­turn to pre-Covid-19 lev­els, thus the ra­tio­nal­i­sa­tion is un­avoid­able” for it to re­main vi­able for em­ploy­ees and stake­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>“In ad­di­tion to the sev­er­ance pack­age, we will be work­ing with (the union), e2i (Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute) and Work­force Sin­ga­pore on pro­vid­ing job as­sis­tance and sup­port.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tan Hock Soon said: “We are ap­pre­cia­tive that (the com­pany) had also com­mit­ted to pro­vide af­fected work­ers with an ad­di­tional 12-month paid union mem­ber­ship so that they can ben­e­fit from the union’s as­sis­tance dur­ing tough times.”</p>
    <p>The union has worked with the com­pany to pro­vide job-match­ing as­sis­tance.</p>
