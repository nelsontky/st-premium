    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) has urged all coun­tries to join its global shared vac­cine pro­gramme, in a let­ter sent by its di­rec­tor-gen­eral, and also spelt out who would get its even­tual coro­n­avirus jabs first.</p>
    <p>GENEVA • The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) has writ­ten to ev­ery coun­try, urg­ing them to quickly join its global shared vac­cine pro­gramme – and spelt out who would get its even­tual coro­n­avirus jabs first.</p>
    <p>WHO di­rec­tor-gen­eral Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus on Tues­day said that with­out vac­ci­nat­ing the planet’s high­est-risk pop­u­la­tions si­mul­ta­ne­ously, it would be im­pos­si­ble to re­build the global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>He said the most ex­posed 20 per cent of each coun­try’s pop­u­la­tion – in­clud­ing front-line health work­ers, adults aged over 65 and those with pre-ex­ist­ing con­di­tions – would be tar­geted in the first wave of vac­ci­na­tions, once the WHO-led Co­vax shared fa­cil­ity can roll out a proven safe and ef­fec­tive vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Ger­many and France want to give more money and power to WHO after the pan­demic un­der­scored long­stand­ing fi­nan­cial and le­gal weak­nesses at the United Na­tions agency, an in­ter­nal doc­u­ment seen by Reuters shows.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed re­forms could al­ready be dis­cussed at WHO in midSeptem­ber, three of­fi­cials fa­mil­iar with the talks told Reuters, in a fast time­line that would con­firm the two Euro­pean pow­ers’ grow­ing con­cerns about the or­gan­i­sa­tion, which they also see as ex­ces­sively sub­ject to ex­ter­nal in­flu­ences.</p>
    <p>In a joint pa­per cir­cu­lated among di­plo­mats in­volved in the re­form talks, Ber­lin and Paris said WHO’s man­date, which in­cludes pre­vent­ing out­breaks across the world and help­ing gov­ern­ments tackle them, was not backed up by suf­fi­cient fi­nan­cial re­sources and le­gal pow­ers. “Not only dur­ing the cur­rent pan­demic, it has be­come clear that the WHO partly lacks the abil­i­ties to ful­fil this man­date,” the doc­u­ment seen by Reuters said.</p>
    <p>The Franco-Ger­man re­form plan is fo­cused on strength­en­ing WHO, in part to em­power it to be able to be more crit­i­cal of mem­ber states if they do not hon­our global rules on trans­parency in re­port­ing health and dis­ease is­sues.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Dr Te­dros told a vir­tual press con­fer­ence: “The fastest way to end this pan­demic and to re­open economies is to start by pro­tect­ing the high­est-risk pop­u­la­tions ev­ery­where, rather than the en­tire pop­u­la­tions of just some coun­tries.”</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus has killed more than 780,000 peo­ple and in­fected over 22 mil­lion since the out­break emerged in China late last year.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal gi­ants are rac­ing to pro­duce a vac­cine, with nine of the 29 cur­rently be­ing tested on hu­mans form­ing part of the Co­vax Global Vac­cines Fa­cil­ity. “If there’s a win­ner in vac­cines, we’ll have one; there’s ab­so­lutely no ques­tion,” WHO ad­viser Bruce Ayl­ward said.</p>
    <p>Some 92 coun­tries are signed up to Co­vax – an ef­fort to pool the costs and re­wards of find­ing, pro­duc­ing and dis­tribut­ing ef­fec­tive vac­cines – while an­other 80 have ex­pressed in­ter­est but have yet to com­mit. WHO wants coun­tries to sig­nal a firm in­ter­est by Aug 31.</p>
    <p>Dr Te­dros said that vac­cine al­lo­ca­tion would be rolled out in two phases. In the first phase, doses would be al­lo­cated pro­por­tion­ally to all par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries si­mul­ta­ne­ously to re­duce the over­all global risk. In the se­cond, in­di­vid­ual coun­tries’ threat and vul­ner­a­bil­ity lev­els will come into play.</p>
    <p>Dr Te­dros said front-line work­ers in health and so­cial care set­tings would get first-phase pri­or­ity “as they are es­sen­tial to treat and pro­tect the pop­u­la­tion, and come in close con­tact with high-mor­tal­ity risk groups”. In the ab­sence of a vac­cine, WHO scotched no­tions that 50 per cent of peo­ple hav­ing de­vel­oped re­sis­tance to the virus would be enough to achieve “herd im­mu­nity” and stop trans­mis­sion.</p>
