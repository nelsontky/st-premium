    <p>DOVER (Eng­land) • Freight trucks head­ing to­wards the English port of Dover were lined up for miles on Thurs­day, just three weeks be­fore Bri­tain ex­its the Euro­pean Union’s or­bit in a po­ten­tially tu­mul­tuous fi­nale to the five-year di­vorce.</p>
    <p>There was a queue ahead of the Euro­tun­nel freight en­trance but the main tail­back was on the ap­proach to the Dover port ter­mi­nal.</p>
    <p>Lo­gis­tics groups have re­ported surg­ing de­mand from com­pa­nies try­ing to bring parts, goods and food into the coun­try be­fore Bri­tain leaves the EU’s sin­gle mar­ket and Cus­toms union, a move that is ex­pected to cause even more dis­rup­tion next month.</p>
    <p>High­ways Eng­land on Thurs­day said there were high vol­umes of freight traf­fic head­ing to­wards Dover and that lor­ries had been backed up along some roads to pre­vent the port from be­com­ing over­whelmed.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s spokesman said yes­ter­day it was wrong to con­flate the long queues with the Brexit is­sue, say­ing the con­ges­tion was mainly caused by a spike in de­mand and Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“It’s been pri­mar­ily caused by a global spike in de­mand for con­sumer goods over many months this year, as well as dis­rup­tion to global ship­ping pat­terns and con­tainer ca­pac­ity re­lated to changes caused by the pan­demic and sub­se­quent com­mer­cial is­sues at ports,” the spokesman told re­porters.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment has warned that even with a trade deal, 7,000 trucks head­ing for the Chan­nel ports in south-east Eng­land could be held in 100km queues if com­pa­nies do not pre­pare the ex­tra pa­per­work re­quired.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness groups this week warned of dif­fi­cul­ties from Jan 1 as a lack of clar­ity on a post-Brexit trade deal has left many com­pa­nies un­able to plan prop­erly.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies across many sec­tors will face dis­rup­tion, said Par­lia­ment’s busi­ness, en­ergy and in­dus­trial strat­egy com­mit­tee.</p>
