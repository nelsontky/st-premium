    <p>LON­DON • Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer in­sisted Manch­ester United are back on track af­ter they avenged their hum­bling Cham­pi­ons League de­feat by Is­tan­bul Basak­se­hir with a 4-1 rout of the Turk­ish cham­pi­ons on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The Red Devils crashed to a shock 2-1 loss at the hands of the Group H out­siders in Tur­key ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>But there was never any chance of an­other up­set as United ran the Cham­pi­ons League debu­tants ragged at Old Traf­ford.</p>
    <p>Bruno Fer­nan­des’ dou­ble was the cat­a­lyst. He also gen­er­ously passed up the chance of a hat-trick to al­low Mar­cus Rash­ford to con­vert from the spot.</p>
    <p>Vic­tory keeps United, with nine points from four games, on track to ad­vance to the knock­out phase.</p>
    <p>A win at home against Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal­ists Paris Sain­tGer­main next week could guar­an­tee top spot in the group. A point from their fi­nal two games, the last be­ing at RB Leipzig next month, will be enough to se­cure at least sec­ond place, leav­ing the United boss sat­is­fied.</p>
    <p>“I felt first half, we saw the in­tent straight away, they wanted to play and they en­joyed it,” Sol­sk­jaer said. “It’s a Cham­pi­ons League night at Old Traf­ford, you’d ex­pect them to en­joy them­selves. We scored some very nice goals, I’m pleased.</p>
    <p>“We need one point, but of course we want to be top of the group but we’ll take it one game at a time.”</p>
    <p>United’s l oss i n Is­tan­bul had raised se­ri­ous ques­tions about Sol­sk­jaer’s abil­ity to hold on to his job.</p>
    <p>But suc­ces­sive Pre­mier League wins against Ever­ton and West Brom, along with this lat­est vic­tory, have eased the pres­sure on the Nor­we­gian some­what.</p>
    <p>He named Uruguay striker Edin­son Ca­vani in the start­ing line-up for the first time since his sign­ing last month, and with Paul Pogba still side­lined by a swollen an­kle, there was also a rare start for Dutch mid­fielder Donny van de Beek.</p>
    <p>“The two are get­ting used to how we want them to play. Donny can play in dif­fer­ent po­si­tions and Edin­son is a good old-fash­ioned</p>
    <p>No. 9. We haven’t had that for a while,” Sol­sk­jaer said.</p>
    <p>Both Ca­vani, who has one goal in seven ap­pear­ances for United, and van de Beek did their chances of more reg­u­lar ac­tion no harm with solid dis­plays, while Fer­nan­des has now been di­rectly in­volved in 34 goals in 35 games in all com­pe­ti­tions since ar­riv­ing in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Van de Beek, who was de­ployed in a role deeper than he is nor­mally ac­cus­tomed to, told MUTV he was will­ing to adapt to the team’s needs to gain more play­ing time.</p>
    <p>“It was re­ally good. Some games, I play No. 10, some­times the coach needs me in the con­trol po­si­tion, that’s fine for me. Some­times in Ajax I was also play­ing in that po­si­tion so it’s OK,” he added.</p>

They can do so with a point from their two re&#xAD;main&#xAD;ing matches.</p>
