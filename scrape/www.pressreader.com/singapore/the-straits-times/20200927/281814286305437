    <p>Two broth­ers who ef­fec­tively worked for the same em­ployer have sued the em­ployer and other re­lated com­pa­nies for dam­ages, af­ter they both fell from a height while work­ing and be­came per­ma­nently dis­abled in sep­a­rate in­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>Bangladesh­is Jahid, 40, and Janaed, 44, who both go by one name, were work per­mit hold­ers here but have since re­turned to their coun­try af­ter their ac­ci­dents in 2018.</p>
    <p>Mr Jahid now de­pends on a wheel­chair af­ter al­legedly fall­ing some 4m from a lad­der on April 7, 2018, while do­ing air-con­di­tion­ing main­te­nance work at the Star­bucks out­let in United Square mall.</p>
    <p>Mr Janaed be­came a bed-rid­den quad­ri­plegic af­ter suf­fer­ing se­vere spinal in­juries from al­legedly fall­ing some 3m while in­spect­ing an over­head chiller at West­gate Tower in Jurong East on Nov 8, 2018.</p>
    <p>Last month, The Straits Times re­ported that the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity Health Ser­vices Group, which runs Na­tional Uni­ver­sity Hos­pi­tal and Alexan­dra Hos­pi­tal, where Mr Janaed was warded, will not seek the re­pay­ment of med­i­cal bills from Mr Janaed, af­ter his em­ployer, Newtec En­gi­neer­ing, de­faulted on the bills amount­ing to $296,000.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments ob­tained by ST this month show that both broth</p>
    <p>Mr Jahid now de­pends on a wheel­chair af­ter al­legedly fall­ing some 4m from a lad­der on April 7, 2018, while do­ing air-con­di­tion­ing main­te­nance work at the Star­bucks out­let in United Square mall.</p>
    <p>Mr Janaed be­came a bed-rid­den quad­ri­plegic af­ter suf­fer­ing se­vere spinal in­juries from al­legedly fall­ing some 3m while in­spect­ing an over­head chiller at West­gate Tower in Jurong East on Nov 8, 2018.</p>
    <p>ers, who are rep­re­sented by Hoh Law Cor­po­ra­tion lawyer N. Srini­vasan, had been ef­fec­tively work­ing for the same air-con­di­tion­ing and me­chan­i­cal ven­ti­la­tion ser­vices com­pany, STA Rita En­gi­neer­ing Ser­vices, at the time of their ac­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>Mr Janaed had been en­gaged by STA Rita En­gi­neer­ing – which em­ployed his brother Mr Jahid – for the work at West­gate Tower, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>JANAED’S CASE</p>
    <p>Mr Janaed is su­ing both the owner of STA Rita En­gi­neer­ing Ser­vices, Mr Felizardo Paras Jose, and his for­mal em­ployer Newtec En­gi­neer­ing, for more than $650,000 in dam­ages.</p>
    <p>He as­serted that both were his “de facto em­ploy­ers” at the time of the in­ci­dent, ac­cord­ing to his state­ment of claim filed last year.</p>
    <p>Also named in the law­suit is the man­age­ment cor­po­ra­tion re­spon­si­ble for the main­te­nance of West­gate Tow­ers, and the main con­trac­tor hired to do air-con­di­tion­ing and ven­ti­la­tion works for West­gate Tow­ers, Zoe In­ter­na­tional. Zoe In­ter­na­tional had sub-con­tracted part or all of its work to STA Rita En­gi­neer­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Jose had taken Mr Janaed to West­gate Tower to re­pair a chiller that was in­stalled on an over­head con­crete plat­form about 2.5m wide and some 3.5m off the ground, claimed Mr Janaed.</p>
    <p>“As part of his work, the plain­tiff was re­quired to climb up a fire­man’s lad­der to get onto the plat­form so as to in­spect the chiller and iden­tify the faulty part that is to be re­paired,” said the state­ment of claim.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he “ac­ci­den­tally fell off the ex­posed edge of the plat­form”, said the state­ment, not­ing that the plat­form had no fall re­straint mea­sures or any sort of fenc­ing along its ex­posed edges.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments stated that Mr Janaed was dis­cov­ered ly­ing on the floor un­con­scious and in­jured only when Mr Jose alerted an em­ployee of the man­age­ment cor­po­ra­tion to check on him af­ter his calls to him went unan­swered.</p>
    <p>Mr Janaed suf­fered se­vere spinal in­juries, mul­ti­ple rib frac­tures and a col­lapsed lung af­ter his fall, ac­cord­ing to a doc­tor’s re­port.</p>
    <p>His di­rect em­ployer, Newtec En­gi­neer­ing, de­faulted on the hos­pi­tal bills, and the Man­power Min­istry has said it is in­ves­ti­gat­ing Newtec En­gi­neer­ing for fail­ing to buy the re­quired in­sur­ance, and for fail­ing to</p>
    <p>pay the med­i­cal ex­penses.</p>
    <p>In his state­ment, Mr Janaed al­leged that the de­fen­dants had failed to en­sure that he was work­ing at height “un­der the im­me­di­ate su­per­vi­sion of a com­pe­tent per­son for that work”, among other neg­li­gence and breach of duty claims.</p>
    <p>Aside from Newtec En­gi­neer­ing, the other de­fen­dants have en­tered their de­fences.</p>
    <p>In de­fence pa­pers filed ear­lier this year, Mr Jose and the man­age­ment cor­po­ra­tion state that the ac­ci­dent was caused or con­trib­uted to by the neg­li­gence of Mr Janaed.</p>
    <p>The man­age­ment cor­po­ra­tion fur­ther noted that Mr Janaed was an “ex­pe­ri­enced worker” who had been work­ing here since 2002, and had at­tended a work-at-height course for su­per­vi­sors.</p>
    <p>They claimed Mr Janaed had failed to main­tain his bal­ance, and failed to abide by the safety is­sues that he had learnt, among other neg­li­gent be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>JAHID’S CASE</p>
    <p>Mr Jose and Zoe In­ter­na­tional are also named as de­fen­dants in Mr Jahid’s suit.</p>
    <p>Mr Jahid is also claim­ing more than $290,000 in dam­ages from Star­bucks Cof­fee Sin­ga­pore and UOL Prop­erty In­vest­ments, which owns the Star­bucks unit.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, Zoe In­ter­na­tional was the main con­trac­tor hired to carry out air-con­di­tion­ing and ven­ti­la­tion works in the mall, in­clud­ing the Star­bucks unit, and it had sub­con­tracted this work to Mr Jose’s com­pany.</p>
    <p>In his state­ment of claim, Mr Jahid said he was tasked by Mr Jose</p>
    <p>to carry out air-con­di­tion­ing and ven­ti­la­tion works on top of a false ceil­ing of the Star­bucks out­let, which was about 5m above the floor of the cof­fee house.</p>
    <p>He “lost his bal­ance” while climb­ing up a lad­der and fell off it from a height of more than 4m, said the state­ment.</p>
    <p>He in­jured his spine and legs in the ac­ci­dent, and has not worked since due to the “pro­found dis­abil­i­ties that re­main af­ter the ac­ci­dent”, a doc­tor’s re­port dated Au­gust last year showed.</p>
    <p>Mr Jahid al­leged that his em­ployer and the three com­pa­nies have thus been neg­li­gent and breached their du­ties, in­clud­ing in fail­ing to pro­vide him with a safe means of ac­cess from the floor to the top ceil­ing.</p>
    <p>They had also in­structed or al­lowed him to work at height with­out first estab­lish­ing whether it was safe, he claimed.</p>
    <p>In de­fence, Mr Jose al­leged that Mr Jahid had been neg­li­gent in the ac­ci­dent as he had failed to use the lad­der safely.</p>
    <p>They had also pro­vided him with a long rope to con­vey equip­ment and tools, but Mr Jahid failed to use it, said Mr Jose.</p>
    <p>Zoe In­ter­na­tional, in its de­fence filed ear­lier this year, said Mr Jahid was the safety su­per­vi­sor of his com­pany “and would have knowl­edge on all safety mea­sures con­cern­ing the work­place”.</p>
    <p>The other com­pa­nies also de­nied the breach of duty and neg­li­gence claims.</p>
    <p>Both cases are on­go­ing.</p>
