    <p>There were two new cases of Covid-19 re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>They were a 41-year-old fe­male In­done­sian work per­mit holder and 35-year-old French­man on a short-term visit pass to see his fi­ancee. Both were asymp­to­matic and tested pos­i­tive while serv­ing their stay-home no­tices.</p>
    <p>The two new cases take Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,116.</p>
    <p>There were no new com­mu­nity cases and none from work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries for the fourth day in a row.</p>
    <p>New cases in the com­mu­nity have re­mained low, with one in the past week, which is un­linked, the Health Min­istry noted.</p>
    <p>It added that epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions are in progress. In the mean­time, all the iden­ti­fied close con­tacts of the cases have been iso­lated and placed on quar­an­tine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quar­an­tine pe­riod so that asymp­to­matic cases are de­tected.</p>
    <p>The min­istry will also con­duct sero­log­i­cal tests for the close con­tacts to de­ter­mine if the cases could have been in­fected by them.</p>
    <p>With 11 new cases dis­charged, 58,004 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>There are 47 pa­tients in hospi­tal – none in in­ten­sive care – while 22 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has recorded 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>There were no new com­mu­nity cases and none from work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries for the fourth day in a row.</p>
