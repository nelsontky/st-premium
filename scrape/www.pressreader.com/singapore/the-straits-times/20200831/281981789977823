    <p>TEAM SPIRIT</p>
    <p>(We) al­ways cheered each other on, and when­ever one of us was feel­ing low... we’d al­ways help each other out. There was ’’ never a ‘give-up’ mo­ment. SERGEANT ANNA (not her real name), who grad­u­ated this month from the Counter As­sault Unit’s three-month course.</p>
    <p>A car screeched to a halt right in the mid­dle of a “ter­ror­ist at­tack”, and four heav­ily ar­moured po­lice of­fi­cers hopped out of the ve­hi­cle and di­rectly into the line of fire.</p>
    <p>The four of­fi­cers then deftly stormed through doors to clear a safe path for their VIP charge, fir­ing rounds to take down the “at­tack­ers”, while pro­tect­ing their charge with their bod­ies.</p>
    <p>Among these four Counter As­sault Unit (CAU) op­er­a­tors in this ex­er­cise sce­nario last Friday was Sergeant Anna (not her real name), the first woman to grad­u­ate from the Po­lice Se­cu­rity Com­mand’s (SecCom) CAU course.</p>
    <p>The iden­ti­ties of CAU op­er­a­tors can­not be made pub­lic due to op­er­a­tional sen­si­tiv­i­ties. They are pri­mar­ily per­sonal se­cu­rity of­fi­cers with SecCom, an elite unit as­signed to pro­tect the pres­i­dent, min­is­ters and other very im­por­tant dig­ni­taries.</p>
    <p>The three-month course is phys­i­cally de­mand­ing, and the pass­ing rate of this lat­est batch – the eighth – was slightly over 60 per cent, with five of eight trainees grad­u­at­ing, in­clud­ing Sgt Anna.</p>
    <p>The spe­cialised CAU is tasked to pro­tect lo­cal and for­eign VIPs dur­ing ma­jor events. It was com­mis­sioned in May 2006, fol­low­ing high­pro­file ter­ror­ist events like the Sept 11 ter­ror at­tacks on the United States in 2001 and the Bali bomb­ings in 2002 and 2005 which tar­geted tourist spots.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cers like Sgt Anna per­form their roles as CAU op­er­a­tors dur­ing ma­jor events such as the 2018 Trump-Kim sum­mit in Sin­ga­pore, at Na­tional Day Pa­rades and, most re­cently, dur­ing the open­ing of Parliament last week.</p>
    <p>In ma­jor in­ci­dents, CAU op­er­a­tors are the first line of de­fence in pro­tect­ing their charges, and their train­ing has to be chal­leng­ing to pre­pare them for this, CAU’s com­mand­ing of­fi­cer, As­sis­tant Su­per­in­ten­dent of Po­lice (ASP) Bros Leong, told the me­dia dur­ing the train­ing de­mon­stra­tion last Friday.</p>
    <p>Op­er­a­tors are se­lected based on their phys­i­cal abil­i­ties and men­tal readi­ness, and they go through a rig­or­ous train­ing pro­gramme that pre­pares them for close-quar­ter bat­tles and at­tack sce­nar­ios, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“They are trained and pre­pared to take a bul­let for the VIPs,” said ASP Leong, adding that in­struc­tors even shoot sim­u­la­tion rounds at their trainees to train them to shield their</p>
    <p>VIP charges in­stead of dodg­ing the rounds.</p>
    <p>Op­er­a­tors must also bear an av­er­age of 20kg of gear while go­ing through their train­ing, as they are decked out in heavy ar­mour and carry ad­di­tional gear like ex­tra am­mu­ni­tion, gas masks and a shield.</p>
    <p>All trainees are held to the same stan­dard dur­ing train­ing re­gard­less of their gen­der, with­out ex­cep­tion, ASP Leong said, adding that he was proud of Sgt Anna for hold­ing her own.</p>
    <p>Sgt Anna said it felt sur­real to have com­pleted the gru­elling course, which ended on Aug 20.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old of­fi­cer, who joined SecCom two years ago, is an avid gamer who has played a lot of first-per­son shoot­ing games. She said she joined the CAU as she was in­ter­ested in tac­ti­cal move­ments and the tac­ti­cal shoot­ing in­volved in oper­a­tions. She was ex­tra-mo­ti­vated to com­plete the course, know­ing she would be the first fe­male to do so, and said her course mates also gave her a lot of en­cour­age­ment.</p>
    <p>“(We) al­ways cheered each other on, and when­ever one of us was feel­ing low... we’d al­ways help each other out. There was never a ‘giveup’ mo­ment,” said Sgt Anna.</p>
    <p>“I hope to mo­ti­vate other as­pir­ing fe­male of­fi­cers... they, too, are able to join the unit, as long as they be­lieve in them­selves.”</p>
