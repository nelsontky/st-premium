    <p>Ms Joyce Orallo Lim crafts home­ware items us­ing jes­monite, an eco-friendly, non-toxic com­pos­ite ma­te­rial</p>
    <p>When Ms Joyce Orallo Lim be­gan cre­at­ing jew­ellery us­ing poly­mer clay in 2018, she thought she had set­tled on the ma­te­rial she wanted to work with as a maker.</p>
    <p>But she soon found that poly­mer clay – a type of plas­tic that hard­ens with heat – and her sus­tain­able sen­si­bil­i­ties were not meant to be.</p>
    <p>“I couldn’t limit the amount of waste I gen­er­ated with poly­mer clay be­cause the ma­te­rial hard­ens and cracks quite eas­ily. I wanted some­thing more sus­tain­able,” the 34-year-old says.</p>
    <p>En­ter jes­monite – an en­vi­ron­ment-friendly, toxin-free com­pos­ite ma­te­rial made of eco-resin and gyp­sum. Ms Lim, who usu­ally goes by the name Joyce, had fi­nally found the one true love of her maker’s life.</p>
    <p>She says: “It’s such a ver­sa­tile and strong ma­te­rial, you can use it to make so many things out­side of jew­ellery. You can also mix any colour pigments you want into the jes­monite com­pos­ites and the colour comes out beau­ti­fully.”</p>
    <p>Ms Lim founded her jes­monite home­ware brand Chokmah (pro­nounced hok-mah, a He­brew word which means wis­dom) in Fe­bru­ary this year. She also runs craft work­shops on us­ing jes­monite.</p>
    <p>The Lasalle Col­lege of the Arts grad­u­ate in in­te­rior de­sign has a trained ar­chi­tect and an in-house artist work­ing with her full-time on the brand. She says Chokmah will soon launch fur­ni­ture and ar­chi­tec­ture wall pan­els.</p>
    <p>Heav­ily in­flu­enced by her archi</p>
    <p>tect fa­ther, Ms Lim has al­ways been artis­tic. She re­mem­bers colour­ing on his floor plans in­stead of colour­ing books as a child.</p>
    <p>Be­fore be­ing an ar­ti­san, she worked at an in­te­rior de­sign firm and took to the skies as a flight at­ten­dant, but was even­tu­ally drawn back to craft­ing and mak­ing.</p>
    <p>She says: “I’ve al­ways wanted to make my own prod­ucts. When I was young, I ad­mired de­sign­ers who had in­no­va­tive prod­ucts to work with – that’s why I wanted to work with jes­monite. I don’t think many peo­ple are us­ing it yet in Sin­ga­pore and I wanted to work with an in­ter­est­ing ma­te­rial.”</p>
    <p>De­spite start­ing her own brand just as the pan­demic hit Sin­ga­pore, her gam­bit paid off. Her brand has sold more than 600 prod­ucts this year and most items on her site are sold out. She also found a ded­i­cated space at *Scape to con­duct her work­shops.</p>
    <p>When Covid-19 in­ter­rupted her sup­ply chain of jes­monite and stu­dents she had con­ducted work­shops for be­gan ask­ing for more of the ma­te­rial as they looked to new hob­bies to fill their time, Ms Lim de­cided to take mat­ters into her own hands.</p>
    <p>She called Jes­monite Lim­ited in Bri­tain and asked to be­come its of­fi­cial dis­trib­u­tor in Sin­ga­pore and South-east Asia. Cast­ing Co is her dis­tri­bu­tion ven­ture.</p>
    <p>More Sin­ga­pore­ans, she says, are get­ting in­ter­ested in arts and crafts, in­clud­ing her own stu­dents, some of whom have started sell­ing their jes­monite prod­ucts on­line.</p>
    <p>“The arts scene here is def­i­nitely be­com­ing more vi­brant. I feel very en­cour­aged when peo­ple come to my work­shop and are in­spired to be­come mak­ers as well. It’s very em­pow­er­ing.”</p>
