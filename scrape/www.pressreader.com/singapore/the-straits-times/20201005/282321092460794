    <p>•</p>
    <p>Months af­ter fin­ish­ing her grad­u­a­tion exam, Pol­ish teenager Iga Swiatek aced the big­gest test of her tennis ca­reer.</p>
    <p>She shocked top seed and 2018 cham­pion Si­mona Halep 6-1, 6-2 at Roland Gar­ros yes­ter­day to set up a meet­ing with Ital­ian qual­i­fier Martina Tre­visan af­ter a day of up­sets in Paris. Fel­low 19-year-old Jan­nik Sin­ner also booked a Ma­jor quar­ter fi­nal berth for the first time by de­feat­ing sixth-seed and US Open fi­nal­ist Alexan­der Zverev 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3.</p>
    <p>Swiatek, ranked No. 54 in the world, tri­umphed on the back of 30 win­ners and did not al­low Halep a sin­gle break point.</p>
    <p>“I am sur­prised I could do this,” she said af­ter end­ing Halep’s ca­reer-best 17-match win­ning streak.</p>
    <p>The world No. 2 had been the over­whelm­ing favourite in the ab­sence of last year’s cham­pion Ash­leigh Barty and US Open win­ner Naomi Osaka as well the in­jury-en­forced with­drawal of 23-time Ma­jor win­ner Ser­ena Wil­liams.</p>
    <p>It was a stun­ning turn­around for Swiatek, who won just one game against Halep at the same stage here last year, get­ting swept off court in just 45 minutes.</p>
    <p>“Last year, I wasn’t ex­pe­ri­enced enough, it was my first match in a big sta­dium so I was a lit­tle stressed, but now I can han­dle the pres­sure,” said Swiatek, who will fo­cus on tennis af­ter fin­ish­ing up high school dur­ing the coro­n­avirus-en­forced lock­down.</p>
    <p>She re­turned to Court PhilippeCh­a­trier to sweep through the open­ing set in just 23 minutes, fir­ing 17 win­ners to Halep’s four. She tight­ened her grip, break­ing in the first game of the sec­ond set with Halep hav­ing to fight off four break points in the third game to stay afloat.</p>
    <p>Halep, 29, who won clay-court ti­tles in Prague and Rome ahead of the French Open, saved five more break points in the fifth game, but a weary fore­hand drifted wide and her Pol­ish op­po­nent was 4-1 up with the cush­ion of a dou­ble break.</p>
    <p>She took vic­tory on a sec­ond match point, end­ing the tie in 68 minutes.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t lose that match, Iga won it,” said the Ro­ma­nian, who made just two un­forced er­rors in the first set. “She was ev­ery­where. I will have a choco­late and I will be bet­ter to­mor­row.”</p>
    <p>Swiatek’s vic­tory was quickly fol­lowed by an­other sur­prise when Tre­visan reg­is­tered a 6-4, 6-4 vic­tory over Dutch fifth seed Kiki Bertens, a semi-fi­nal­ist in 2016.</p>
    <p>Tre­visan, ranked No. 159, is the first qual­i­fier to make the last eight since Yaroslava Shve­dova in 2012 and had saved two match points in her third-round win over Greek 20th seed Maria Sakkari.</p>
    <p>“I’m liv­ing in a dream,” said the Ital­ian, whose other ap­pear­ance in the main draw of a Ma­jor came at the Aus­tralian Open in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>She will break into the top 100 fol­low­ing a run that will net her at least €283,500 (S$453,000) – more than tripling her earn­ings this year.</p>
    <p>Once a promis­ing ju­nior player, reach­ing the semi-fi­nals in the girls’ dou­bles at Roland Gar­ros and Wim­ble­don over a decade ago, her ca­reer was put on hold a decade ago as she strug­gled with an eat­ing dis­or­der. She had to be “re-ed­u­cated to eat” fol­low­ing years of suf­fer­ing from anorexia af­ter her father Clau­dio, a for­mer foot­baller in Italy’s sec­ond di­vi­sion, was di­ag­nosed with a de­gen­er­a­tive dis­ease.</p>
    <p>“I know that I have done a great job right now un­til to­day,” the 26-year-old said of her road to re­cov­ery which saw her spend four years away from tennis. “The mes­sage is to fo­cus on your dream and never give up on your life, on ev­ery­thing you want to do and you want to reach.”</p>
    <p>The shocks mean that only four seeds re­main in the women’s draw – third seed Elina Svi­tolina, fourth­seeded Aus­tralian Open cham­pion Sofia Kenin, two-time Wim­ble­don win­ner Pe­tra Kvi­tova, seeded sev­enth, and Tu­nisia’s Ons Jabeur, the 30th seed.</p>
    <p>There was also a sur­prise in the men’s draw as Ital­ian teenager Sin­ner be­came the first debu­tant to reach the French Open quar­ter-fi­nals since Rafael Nadal in 2005.</p>
    <p>He will face the 12-time cham­pion af­ter tak­ing out a fever­ish Zverev. Last year’s Nex­tGen cham­pion dropped his first set of the tour­na­ment against the Ger­man but demon­strated his re­solve to close out the win in four.</p>
    <p>“I’m com­pletely sick,” Zverev said. “I can’t re­ally breathe, as you can hear by my voice. I had fever, you know, as well. It was 38 in the night or in the evening.”</p>
    <p>Play­ers are reg­u­larly tested for Covid-19 but Zverev de­clined to an­swer a ques­tion about the date of his last test.</p>
    <p>TOO GOOD ON THE DAY</p>
    <p>I didn’t lose that match, Iga won it. She was ev­ery­where. I will have a choco­late and I will be bet­ter ’’ to­mor­row.</p>
