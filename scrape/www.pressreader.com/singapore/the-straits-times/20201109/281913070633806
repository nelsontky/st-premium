    <p>Pro­fes­sor Irv­ing Fisher, who a cen­tury ago was one of the world’s most fa­mous econ­o­mists, once de­clared: “The saga­cious busi­ness­man is con­stantly fore­cast­ing.”</p>
    <p>Well, per­haps. But how saga­cious is it to be con­stantly fore­cast­ing, when the fore­casts seem so of­ten to be wrong?</p>
    <p>Sig­nif­i­cant amounts of money, not to men­tion in­cal­cu­la­ble re­serves of in­tel­lec­tual and emo­tional en­ergy, were in­vested in the prob­lem of fig­ur­ing out who was go­ing to win the 2020 United States pres­i­den­tial election.</p>
    <p>The polls re­peat­edly and con­sis­tently sug­gested a huge win for the Demo­crat Joe Bi­den. That is not how things have panned out.</p>
    <p>What did we know be­fore­hand? That if the polls were wrong in the same way as in 2016, the election would end up with Repub­li­can Don­ald Trump very close in Florida and Penn­syl­va­nia. A polling er­ror frac­tion­ally big­ger than 2016 would put us ex­actly where we found our­selves — on the edge of our col­lec­tive seats, if not los­ing our col­lec­tive minds. No one is re­ally that sur­prised. Yes, Mr Bi­den’s lead was larger and more sta­ble than Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton’s in 2016. Yes, poll­sters had in prin­ci­ple cor­rected for their ear­lier mis­takes. Yes, while polling er­rors could still be ex­pected, it was as likely that Mr Bi­den would over­per­form and grab Ohio and Texas as that he would un­der­per­form, fail­ing to win Florida. Yes, yes, yes. But no one could quite be­lieve the polls. And it seems we were right to doubt.</p>
    <p>The state-level polls were in­deed off in much the same way and in much the same places as they were in 2016 and the 2018 midterms. Poll­sters do not want to be wrong, and they par­tic­u­larly dis­like be­ing wrong in the same way twice in a row. So while polling er­rors are com­mon, it is a sur­prise light­ning struck twice in the same place.</p>
    <p>At this early stage one can only guess at what went wrong, but it is worth un­der­lin­ing the dif­fi­culty that poll­sters face.</p>
    <p>Con­sider the sit­u­a­tion in Florida, where polls sug­gested Mr Bi­den would win 51 per cent of the vote and Mr Trump 48-49 per cent. The ac­tual re­sult was the re­verse.</p>
    <p>But step back. The pre-election numbers sug­gest that in a typ­i­cal poll with 500 pos­i­tive re­sponses, 255 went for Mr Bi­den and 243 for Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>But typ­i­cal re­sponse rates are five in 100 — of­ten lower, says statis­ti­cian Andrew Gel­man, a prom­i­nent election mod­eller. He says that only around one in 100 peo­ple re­spond to opin­ion polls. So now pic­ture 10,000 peo­ple, 255 who called their vote for Mr Bi­den,</p>
    <p>243 for Mr Trump and 9,500 who never re­sponded. How con­fi­dent are we feel­ing now?</p>
    <p>Worse, the peo­ple who do re­ply will be sys­tem­at­i­cally dif­fer­ent from those who do not: older and whiter, more likely to be women.</p>
    <p>Poll­sters may try to cor­rect for these fac­tors to en­sure that the de­mo­graph­ics of the poll match the de­mo­graph­ics of the cen­sus.</p>
    <p>Per­haps Cuban-Amer­i­cans in Florida are un­der-rep­re­sented in the poll by a fac­tor of three. Fine: let’s say the Cuban-Amer­i­cans who do re­ply count triple.</p>
    <p>But does this help? What as­sur­ance do we have that the tiny mi­nor­ity who bother to re­spond are a good proxy for the vast ma­jor­ity who do not? One poll­ster told me: “Half the time, our ad­just­ments</p>
    <p>make things bet­ter. Half the time they make things worse.”</p>
    <p>Com­pli­cat­ing mat­ters still fur­ther is the ques­tion of turnout.</p>
    <p>Some­one may tell the poll­sters that they are plan­ning to vote. But will they? This caused prob­lems for fore­cast­ing the Brexit ref­er­en­dum in Bri­tain. Older, less-ed­u­cated vot­ers told poll­sters they would show up in force to vote Leave. Prior elec­tions sug­gested other­wise. Poll­sters who placed more weight on his­tory than on their own raw data were tripped up. Turnout in this US election has been un­usu­ally high, giv­ing poll­sters an­other headache.</p>
    <p>We shouldn’t ex­ag­ger­ate the prob­lem. Polls do gen­er­ate in­for­ma­tion. Ev­ery sin­gle state that the Fi­nan­cial Times con­fi­dently pre­dicted would vote for Mr Bi­den, voted for Mr Bi­den. Ev­ery sin­gle state that the FT con­fi­dently pre­dicted would vote for Mr Trump, voted for Mr Trump. Those calls were not made by leaps of po­lit­i­cal in­tu­ition, but by look­ing at where the polls pre­dicted a safe mar­gin.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump needed to win most of the mar­ginal states to have a chance, and promptly bagged three of the four big ones, Florida, Ohio and Texas, deny­ing Mr Bi­den the quick and de­ci­sive vic­tory for which he might rea­son­ably have hoped.</p>
    <p>It’s not that the polls told us noth­ing. It’s that they could not tell us what we yearned to know. We want cer­tainty, but we can’t al­ways get what we want.</p>
    <p>In a close-run election where most peo­ple refuse to speak to poll­sters, opin­ion polls can­not do away with the un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>Prof Fisher was quite right to highlight the need to think about the fu­ture. We must, after all, weigh up our chances and make our de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>But, as his con­tem­po­rary John May­nard Keynes fa­mously re­marked, some­times “we sim­ply do not know”. And since Prof Fisher was even­tu­ally ru­ined, while Keynes died a mil­lion­aire, a lit­tle ag­nos­ti­cism comes in very handy.</p>
    <p>In any case, we must learn to live with un­cer­tainty. Per­haps we should ob­sess less about the ques­tion “Will it hap­pen?”, and de­vote more thought to what we would do if it did.</p>
