    <p>Complaints about se­cond-hand smoke in res­i­den­tial ar­eas here have risen in re­cent months, with MPs tak­ing var­i­ous steps to ad­dress the is­sues.</p>
    <p>Such feed­back ex­ceeded 2,500 re­ports a month for May and June, from below 2,000 monthly be­fore, ac­cord­ing to data from the Mu­nic­i­pal Ser­vices Of­fice (MSO).</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Sim Ann, who over­sees the MSO, said the in­crease prob­a­bly stems from more peo­ple work­ing from home, the “new nor­mal” dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“It’s very likely that peo­ple who used to smoke, pri­mar­ily at the work­place, are now bring­ing the habit back to where they live,” she said yes­ter­day, adding that this is a wide­spread is­sue that many MPs are fac­ing.</p>
    <p>While smok­ers break no l aws when they light up in their own homes, some smoke at stair­wells or void decks, which is il­le­gal.</p>
    <p>Ms Sim added that the MSO is study­ing the is­sue closely, in­clud­ing as­sess­ing dif­fer­ent solutions such as me­di­a­tion or the com­mu­nity dis­pute res­o­lu­tion tri­bunal.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, she has been look­ing at ef­forts in var­i­ous es­tates, where MPs have been us­ing var­i­ous means to per­suade smok­ers to be more con­sid­er­ate of the smoke af­fect­ing their neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>In MP Car­rie Tan’s Nee Soon South ward, for ex­am­ple, 50 des­ig­nated smok­ing points have been set up since 2017, when they were first im­ple­mented by her pre­de­ces­sor, Ms Lee Bee Wah. These are small shel­ters lo­cated on the ground floor a short dis­tance away from res­i­den­tial blocks.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng Hak Hai, chair­man of Nee Soon South’s clean and green com­mit­tee, said that each of these des­ig­nated smok­ing points costs about $8,000 but they are funded by pub­lic do­na­tions from in­di­vid­u­als or busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>In re­cent weeks, some 200 to 300 cig­a­rette butts have been col­lected at the more fre­quented smok­ing points, he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan, an MP for Nee Soon GRC, said the is­sue of se­cond-hand smoke has been raised es­pe­cially by younger fam­i­lies liv­ing in buildto-or­der Hous­ing Board flats.</p>
    <p>Apart from the smok­ing points, she has placed posters in lifts and ar­eas at HDB blocks where there have been complaints.</p>
    <p>The posters re­mind smok­ers that there are young chil­dren or ba­bies in the vicin­ity and ask them not to smoke in the area.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan said she will re­view the ef­fec­tive­ness of these ini­tia­tives af­ter three months be­fore de­cid­ing on the next steps.</p>
    <p>In her own Bukit Timah ward, Ms Sim has been giv­ing ham­pers since the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod to smok­ers who have been the sub­ject of complaints from their neigh­bours. The ham­pers come with healthy food such as fruit and nuts, and a let­ter from Ms Sim ap­peal­ing to the smoker to con­sider the ef­fects of smoke on his neigh­bours, and to en­cour­age him to quit the habit.</p>
    <p>Her team is also con­sid­er­ing en­closed smok­ing points in the ward.</p>
    <p>Both MPs said these were part of ef­forts to use gen­tler meth­ods of “moral sua­sion”, to raise aware­ness and per­suade smok­ers be­fore re­sort­ing to stronger mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“It’s not al­ways about the big stick of en­force­ment,” said Ms Sim, an MP for Hol­land-Bukit Timah GRC.</p>
