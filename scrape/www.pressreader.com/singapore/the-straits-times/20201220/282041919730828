    <p>With Christ­mas upon us in a mat­ter of days, I have yet to get into a fully cel­e­bra­tory mood, al­though I have been in­vited to the odd pre-Christ­mas din­ner here and there. I haven’t even bought any presents for my fam­ily but will do so soon.</p>
    <p>It’s been a long dif­fi­cult year, with loss of in­come, pay cuts and job losses af­fect­ing many. Doc­tors have not been spared, with med­i­cal tourism grind­ing to a halt, and we are all right­fully wor­ried about when and how we will re­cover from this.</p>
    <p>Work has thank­fully kept me busy and dis­tracted th­ese past few weeks. This was a nice change from the dis­mal, gloomy out­look we had ex­pe­ri­enced dur­ing the ear­lier part of the year, when the cir­cuit breaker was in force and peo­ple stayed home to avoid crowded places and to help slow down the spread of Covid-19. There were months when we saw only a hand­ful of pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Grad­u­ally, I have no­ticed that peo­ple’s rou­tines are now go­ing back to nor­mal, and there is a rekin­dled de­sire to put their best face for­ward.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients are more con­fi­dent about step­ping out of their homes and seek­ing cos­metic en­hance­ment to look good for Christ­mas and the New Year.</p>
    <p>My mother, who at 81 years old is as feisty as ever and rises to any oc­ca­sion, has al­ready had the house re­painted and dec­o­rated, the sofa re­uphol­stered and her trusty Christ­mas tree set up, with its fairy lights flash­ing, baubles dan­gling and the gold star glit­ter­ing on top.</p>
    <p>But it will be a very dif­fer­ent Christ­mas this year, for sure. In the past, we would have count­less friends over on Christ­mas Eve for a party that my mother has held for me ev­ery year since I was born.</p>
    <p>Rau­cous and joy­ous with plenty of cheer, it’s the one day of the year that I look for­ward to and the day that makes my mother hap­pi­est as she gets to see many of our old friends gath­ered to­gether.</p>
    <p>There would al­ways be tons of food, from tur­keys and hams to pies and tarts, but ev­ery­one would re­ally look for­ward to my mother’s home-made ox­tail stew that she would have la­bo­ri­ously pre­pared for days be­fore­hand.</p>
    <p>This year, she has planned an­other grand menu for</p>
    <p>Christ­mas, but there will be only our im­me­di­ate fam­ily mem­bers of five, our helpers and our dogs and cats to en­joy the feast. My mother, ever the eter­nal op­ti­mist, sees the bright side of ev­ery­thing and I find her bound­less en­ergy re­fresh­ing and take strength from it.</p>
    <p>When I had asked her ear­lier if she was in the mood to have a party this year, think­ing she would want to give it a miss, she re­torted: “Of course I’m hav­ing a party, even if it’s just for the few of us. I’m not go­ing to let this pan­demic make me miss my an­nual Christ­mas din­ner. There are just some tra­di­tions we can’t and mustn’t give up.” Ap­par­ently, it will take a lot more than a virus to stop her Christ­mas Eve cel­e­bra­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, many of us still feel a bit shell-shocked from the fe­roc­ity of the global pan­demic which still rages in other parts of the world. It feels as if we have just sur­vived World War III and are cau­tiously pick­ing our­selves up af­ter a bat­tle. I re­mem­ber the ghost town qual­ity of the empty streets dur­ing the two-month lock­down, as we gingerly ven­tured be­yond our doorsteps to buy sup­plies and medicines. It felt ex­tremely sur­real, like liv­ing in a post-apoc­a­lyp­tic world.</p>
    <p>OR­DEAL AND SUR­VIVAL</p>
    <p>My ma­ter­nal grand­fa­ther, Ong Cheng Bow, died in 1992 at what I con­sid­ered the young age of 75. Grow­ing up in his home, I of­ten won­dered why he was not more of a go-get­ter. He was cer­tainly charis­matic, in­tel­li­gent as well as ar­tis­ti­cally tal­ented, and could have been more suc­cess­ful had he been more am­bi­tious.</p>
    <p>But he had a happy-go-lucky na­ture and was con­tent to be a po­lice­man for most of his life, and then a gen­eral man­ager in a pa­per com­pany af­ter his re­tire­ment from the force. He led a sim­ple life with a mod­est in­come, and never had a de­sire to be rich or fa­mous.</p>
    <p>He used to tell me sto­ries about his ex­pe­ri­ences dur­ing the war years. And it was only af­ter lis­ten­ing to his sto­ries – the many atroc­i­ties and acts of tor­ture he wit­nessed – that I re­alised what he and my grand­mother had been through and how the war had shaped their per­spec­tive on life.</p>
    <p>Grandpa was only 24 when he had been forcibly taken from the fam­ily home by Ja­panese sol­diers early one morn­ing in 1941. There was no ap­par­ent rea­son for this and he was put to­gether with other young male pris­on­ers in the mid­dle of a fenced-in field in Telok Ku­rau. Their hands were tied and they sat shirt­less, ex­posed to the sun and rain for days un­til they turned red as lobsters. One can only imag­ine what was to come next. My grand­mother was fran­tic with worry and fear, af­ter hear­ing ter­ri­fy­ing sto­ries about peo­ple be­ing cap­tured, tor­tured and then killed by the Ja­panese.</p>
    <p>Amaz­ingly, my grandpa’s sis­ter, who was just a year older, man­aged to crawl through a nearby drain, slip un­der the perime­ter fence and set my grandpa free. To­gether, they quickly crawled back into the drain, wrig­gled away and then ran for their lives. He hid in his broth­erin-law’s house for the next few weeks un­til it was cer­tain the sol­diers were not com­ing back for him. It was a lucky es­cape as the other pris­on­ers were never seen again.</p>
    <p>The or­deal had shown him that life was pre­cious and not to be taken for granted.</p>
    <p>WHAT MAT­TERS MOST</p>
    <p>Af­ter hear­ing th­ese sto­ries, I never again thought of grandpa as un­am­bi­tious. I un­der­stood why he and my grand­mother were just happy to be alive. That was the most im­por­tant thing to them – their health and be­ing with their loved ones. Noth­ing else mat­tered.</p>
    <p>Noth­ing fazed them, as long as the fam­ily was to­gether.</p>
    <p>I am sure many of us feel the same way af­ter hav­ing ex­pe­ri­enced pos­si­bly one of the worst years of our lives, a year of chaos and dis­rup­tions, where the world came to a stand­still, fac­ing the threat of a dreaded virus that still haunts us. It has been al­most like be­ing in a war, cop­ing with daily chal­lenges, bat­tling an in­vis­i­ble en­emy and over­com­ing tremen­dous daily chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>In a way, like my grandpa many decades ago, I feel such a tremen­dous re­lief and joy to be alive and healthy, and to have my fam­ily with me now that the worst seems to be be­hind us.</p>
    <p>This year, Christ­mas will in­deed be very spe­cial, for it will be the per­fect time to truly count our bless­ings and give thanks to ev­ery­one around us who has worked tire­lessly so that we are able to cel­e­brate the sea­son in this se­cure, safe and sta­ble en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>The good news that we will be en­ter­ing phase three of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing on Dec 28 is the best Christ­mas present we could have wished for.</p>
    <p>Thank you, all my dear health­care col­leagues, and Merry Christ­mas, ev­ery­one!</p>

        <p data-role="text">Dr Wof&#xAD;fles Wu as a child in 1960 with his late grand&#xAD;fa&#xAD;ther Ong Cheng Bow, who sur&#xAD;vived the Ja&#xAD;panese Oc&#xAD;cu&#xAD;pa&#xAD;tion. Dr Wu says this year has been al&#xAD;most like be&#xAD;ing in a war, cop&#xAD;ing with daily chal&#xAD;lenges, bat&#xAD;tling an in&#xAD;vis&#xAD;i&#xAD;ble en&#xAD;emy and over&#xAD;com&#xAD;ing tremen&#xAD;dous daily chal&#xAD;lenges. But, just like how his grand&#xAD;fa&#xAD;ther emerged from his or&#xAD;deal just happy to be alive, Dr Wu feels a tremen&#xAD;dous re&#xAD;lief and joy to be alive and healthy, and to have his fam&#xAD;ily with him now that the worst seems to be over.</p>
