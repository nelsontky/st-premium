    <p>A health­care group, which runs National Uni­ver­sity Hos­pi­tal (NUH) and Alexan­dra Hos­pi­tal, has said it is not pur­su­ing a $296,000 award it won in court against a quad­ri­plegic for­eign worker, whose em­ployer had de­faulted on pay­ing his med­i­cal treat­ment bills.</p>
    <p>“We un­der­stand his cir­cum­stances,” the National Uni­ver­sity Health Ser­vices (NUHS) group told The Straits Times re­cently.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) also told ST ear­lier this week that the em­ployer, Newtec En­gi­neer­ing, is be­ing in­ves­ti­gated for fail­ing to pay the med­i­cal ex­penses and buy the re­quired in­sur­ance for the for­eign worker.</p>
    <p>Mr Janaed, 44, who goes by one name, had suf­fered se­vere in­juries from a 3m-high fall at West­gate Tower in Jurong, in Novem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>He was warded at NUH for 91 days be­fore be­ing trans­ferred to Alexan­dra Hos­pi­tal, where he stayed for 152 days. Alexan­dra’s bill was al­most $82,970 and NUH’s, about $213,000.</p>
    <p>Both hos­pi­tals sued him as well as Newtec En­gi­neer­ing for the money. But Newtec did not ap­pear in court for both cases and in a de­fault move, the hos­pi­tals en­tered judg­ments against it.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the cases against Mr Janaed went ahead, and the is­sue of who is li­able to pay arose in the rare in­stance of an em­ployer fail­ing to show up when sued.</p>
    <p>The dis­trict court ruled that when an em­ployer guar­an­tees to un­der­write a for­eign worker’s med­i­cal costs, it does not mean the worker is not li­able to pay the bills.</p>
    <p>The court said Newtec’s let­ters of guar­an­tee to the two hos­pi­tals gave both the op­tion of look­ing to</p>
    <p>Newtec for the pay­ments.</p>
    <p>“They do not, how­ever, pre­vent them from re­cov­er­ing any un­paid med­i­cal ex­penses from the (worker),” said Dis­trict Judge Chiah Kok Khun in de­ci­sion grounds is­sued in May this year.</p>
    <p>The judge added: “We should not im­pose a le­gal bur­den on a hos­pi­tal to ob­tain from a pa­tient, who is sent to its emer­gency de­part­ment, both the con­sent to the treat­ment and the agree­ment to pay, be­fore ren­der­ing med­i­cal treat­ment, par­tic­u­larly when the pa­tient is taken to the hos­pi­tal un­con­scious.</p>
    <p>“That the is­sue of ne­ces­si­tous in­ter­ven­tion raised an in­ter­est­ing ques­tion does not de­tract from the fact that this is a tragic case.”</p>
    <p>Mr Janaed, a fa­ther of two young sons, re­turned to Bangladesh af­ter his treat­ment but his in­juries left him a bed-rid­den quad­ri­plegic.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to queries, an NUHS spokesman said that as with other cases in­volv­ing de­faults on pay­ment, it had ex­er­cised its op­tions as part of the le­gal process.</p>
    <p>It added: “Mr Janaed was a pa­tient whom we have cared for, and we un­der­stand his cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>“We will not be pur­su­ing any re­pay­ment of the med­i­cal and hos­pi­tal bills from him. We, how­ever, re­serve our rights to take any nec­es­sary ac­tion against the em­ployer.”</p>
    <p>MOM, in its state­ment, said em­ploy­ers of work per­mit hold­ers are re­quired to buy and main­tain ad­e­quate work in­jury com­pen­sa­tion in­sur­ance for their work­ers.</p>
    <p>They also have to buy and main­tain manda­tory med­i­cal in­sur­ance with a min­i­mum cov­er­age of $15,000 for in­pa­tient treat­ment for each worker, it added.</p>
    <p>“For fail­ing to pur­chase and main­tain both types of in­sur­ance and to pay for the med­i­cal ex­penses of Mr Janaed, MOM is in­ves­ti­gat­ing Newtec for of­fences un­der the Work In­jury Com­pen­sa­tion Act (Wica) and the Em­ploy­ment of For­eign Man­power Act, re­spec­tively.”</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers who fail to pro­vide ad­e­quate in­sur­ance un­der Wica face a fine of up to $10,000 or a max­i­mum jail term of 12 months, or both.</p>
    <p>Those who do not buy and main­tain the manda­tory med­i­cal in­sur­ance or pay for a worker’s med­i­cal treat­ment can be fined up to $10,000 or jailed a max­i­mum of 12 months, or both.</p>
    <p>MOM added that Mr Janaed filed a work in­jury com­pen­sa­tion claim on Feb 16 last year but with­drew it on Oct 25 to pur­sue a civil suit un­der com­mon law.</p>
    <p>The ac­ci­dent is a dou­ble blow to Mr Janaed.Seven months be­fore his tragedy, his younger brother Jahid, 40, also fell some 4m to the ground from a lad­der while do­ing air-con­di­tion­ing main­te­nance work at a Thom­son Road cof­fee­house. He suf­fered spinal and leg in­juries, and can no longer work as an air-con me­chanic be­cause of his per­ma­nent dis­abil­ity</p>
    <p>Hoh Law Cor­po­ra­tion lawyer N. Srini­vasan has filed two sep­a­rate law­suits on their be­half for dam­ages. Both cases are pend­ing.</p>
    <p>NO AC­TION AGAINST WORKER</p>
    <p>Mr Janaed was a pa­tient whom we have cared for, and we un­der­stand his cir­cum­stances. We will not be pur­su­ing any re­pay­ment of the med­i­cal and hos­pi­tal bills from him. We, how­ever, re­serve our rights to take any nec­es­sary ac­tion against ’’ the em­ployer.</p>
