    <p>Mikel Arteta ex­pects Pierre-Em­er­ick Aubameyang to fi­nally com­mit his fu­ture to Arsenal in the next few days, af­ter the Gabon for­ward’s su­perb strike capped yes­ter­day’s 3-0 win at Ful­ham.</p>
    <p>The Gun­ners kicked off the new English Premier League sea­son with the kind of con­fi­dent dis­play that has be­come their hall­mark since the Spa­niard took charge last De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Arsenal’s free-flow­ing at­tack was too in­ci­sive for newly pro­moted Ful­ham and Alexan­dre La­cazette gave the visi­tors an early lead at Craven Cot­tage.</p>
    <p>Brazil­ian de­fender Gabriel then scored the sec­ond goal four min­utes af­ter the break in his first ap­pear­ance since his £23 mil­lion (S$40.3 mil­lion) sum­mer move from Lille.</p>
    <p>Aubameyang added t he fi­nal flour­ish with a typ­i­cally eye-catch­ing strike, which em­pha­sised why Arsenal are so des­per­ate for their cap­tain to sign an ex­ten­sion to the con­tract which ex­pires at the end of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>Gun­ners boss Arteta had good news for sup­port­ers con­cerned the 31-year-old star might leave, re­veal­ing that their top scorer for the past two sea­sons was on the verge of pen­ning an ex­ten­sion.</p>
    <p>“I’m re­ally pos­i­tive we are go­ing to get it done very soon and, hope­fully in the next few days, you will get some news,” he told BT Sport.</p>
    <p>With for­mer Chelsea for­ward Wil­lian pro­vid­ing a pair of as­sists on his de­but, it was the ideal way for Arsenal to start a sea­son that ap­pears full of promise af­ter last sea­son’s FA Cup tri­umph.</p>
    <p>Al­though their eighth-place fin­ish in the top flight was their low­est fi­nal po­si­tion since 1995, Arteta had lit­tle to do with that, with the poor re­sults in the first half of the term at­trib­uted to the fired Unai Emery.</p>
    <p>The for­mer Manch­ester City as­sis­tant has been a breath of fresh air and push­ing for a place in the top four should not be be­yond his re­vi­talised team this term.</p>
    <p>“I wanted to see my team de­ter­mined to come to this dif­fi­cult ground against a re­ally good team that has been pro­moted,” Arteta said. “Gabriel didn’t play for six months be­fore to­day. Mo­hamed El­neny was bril­liant. He has been ex­cel­lent in train­ing. All the boys tried re­ally hard.”</p>
    <p>Arteta also con­firmed that de­fender Rob Hold­ing had forced his way into his plans for the cam­paign, thus nix­ing a pro­posed loan move to New­cas­tle United.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he hinted backup goal­keeper Emil­iano Martinez, who has been the sub­ject of a £15 mil­lion bid by As­ton Villa and is also wanted by Brighton, could be off af­ter he was not even named on the bench.</p>
    <p>On the Ar­gen­tinian, who was in­stru­men­tal in help­ing Arsenal earn their 14th FA Cup, Arteta said: “We have a spe­cial sit­u­a­tion. Ob­vi­ously, the trans­fer mar­ket is open and we know all the ru­mours, so we made the de­ci­sion to start Bernd (Leno) to­day.”</p>
    <p>I’m re­ally pos­i­tive we are go­ing to get it done very soon and, hope­fully in the next few days, you will get some news.</p>
