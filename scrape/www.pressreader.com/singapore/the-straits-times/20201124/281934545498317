    <p>As all eyes were on the United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in re­cent weeks, Bei­jing was aim­ing its trade ar­rows at Can­berra. Aus­tralian tim­ber, coal, wine and beef ex­porters were be­ing threat­ened with new Chi­nese bar­ri­ers erected to pre­vent the sale of their goods.</p>
    <p>The rea­son? To hit back at the Aus­tralian gov­ern­ment’s state­ments on Chi­nese gov­ern­ment ac­tions in Xin­jiang and Hong Kong, the ban­ning of Huawei from Aus­tralia’s 5G net­work, Can­berra’s call for an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the ori­gins of the coro­n­avirus, as well as ac­cu­sa­tions about Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party in­ter­fer­ence in Aus­tralian pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>As has be­come par for the course, Bei­jing did not ac­tu­ally ac­knowl­edge that any trade slow­down was hap­pen­ing at all. But as Chi­nese officials de­flected any di­rect con­nec­tion to re­stricted Aus­tralian im­ports, For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian last Thursday listed po­lit­i­cal “mis­takes” that Can­berra has com­mit­ted which are “the root cause of China-Aus­tralia re­la­tions tak­ing a sharp down­turn”.</p>
    <p>These were part of a hefty list of 14 griev­ances given by Chi­nese diplo­mats to officials in Can­berra ear­lier last week.</p>
    <p>Iron­i­cally, these puni­tive ac­tions were tran­spir­ing as Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping told the as­sem­bled crowd at the an­nual China im­port expo in Shang­hai of the coun­try’s “sin­cere de­sire to share its mar­ket op­por­tu­ni­ties with the world and con­trib­ute to the global eco­nomic re­cov­ery”.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing, he added, was com­mit­ted to “mu­tual open­ing” and sup­port for the mul­ti­lat­eral, rules-based trad­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>This is not the first time Bei­jing has used the threat and im­po­si­tion of trade re­stric­tive mea­sures to re­spond to what it per­ceived as for­eign pol­icy po­si­tions or ac­tions of an­other coun­try.</p>
    <p>FROM NOR­WE­GIAN SALMON TO PHILIP­PINE BANANAS</p>
    <p>The first of these high-pro­file in­ci­dents oc­curred in 2010, when Nor­we­gian salmon paid the price for the No­bel Com­mit­tee’s de­ci­sion to give the Peace Prize to Chi­nese dis­si­dent Liu Xiaobo, and was fol­lowed by other in­ci­dents, in­clud­ing: In 2010, Chi­nese Cus­toms officials halted ex­ports of rare earths to Ja­pan over a ter­ri­to­rial dis­pute; in 2012, Philip­pine ba­nana ex­porters found their pro­duce rot­ting on the docks in­stead of find­ing their way to China, the re­sult of a dif­fer­ent set of dis­putes with the Chi­nese over ter­ri­to­rial claims.</p>
    <p>More re­cently, puni­tive mea­sures were taken by the Chi­nese against South Korean com­pa­nies, prod­ucts and tourism when Seoul de­ployed a US anti-mis­sile sys­tem.</p>
    <p>And last year, Cana­dian canola ex­porters found their ac­cess to the Chi­nese mar­ket shut off, likely caught in a larger dis­pute over the US ex­tra­di­tion re­quest re­gard­ing Huawei’s chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer Meng Wanzhou.</p>
    <p>All of these episodes, un­for­tu­nately, fol­low a sim­i­lar</p>
    <p>pat­tern. Chi­nese lead­ers make a de­ter­mi­na­tion that the state­ments or poli­cies of a cer­tain coun­try un­der­mine some as­pect of the party’s rule or se­cu­rity in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese trade bu­reau­cracy then looks for ways to “pun­ish” the of­fend­ing coun­try by im­pos­ing opaque trade or in­vest­ment re­stric­tions with­out of­fi­cial no­ti­fi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>This, in turn, pro­vides enough plau­si­ble de­ni­a­bil­ity to sug­gest that the mea­sures are not be­ing or­ches­trated by the cen­tral gov­ern­ment even as For­eign Min­istry spokesman and state-run na­tion­al­ist tabloids such as the Global Times keep up a steady drum­beat of com­plaints about the wrong done to “China” by the of­fend­ing coun­try.</p>
    <p>As As­sis­tant Min­is­ter of Com­merce Li Cheng­gang told the press re­gard­ing the re­cent flap with Aus­tralia: Can­berra “knows what it needs to do to im­prove this re­la­tion­ship”.</p>
    <p>AGAINST THE RULES-BASED SYS­TEM</p>
    <p>This use of non-trans­par­ent re­stric­tions to pun­ish other coun­tries for their poli­cies goes against the let­ter and spirit of the rules-based trad­ing sys­tem, and calls into ques­tion the value of con­clud­ing free trade agree­ments with Bei­jing, as Can­berra and Seoul have done.</p>
    <p>It is par­tic­u­larly dif­fi­cult to rec­on­cile these re­cent puni­tive ac­tions against Aus­tralian im­ports with the sign­ing ear­lier this month of a 15-na­tion trade pact known as the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship – with both China and Aus­tralia key mem­bers of the agree­ment.</p>
    <p>China has been all too quick to crit­i­cise the US for its uni­lat­eral</p>
    <p>ac­tions and other mea­sures that are in­con­sis­tent with World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) rules over the past four years, while try­ing to herald it­self as the cham­pion of the rules-based mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>But point­ing to ob­jec­tion­able prac­tices by Washington does not ex­cuse Bei­jing’s own be­hav­iour here. China has re­peat­edly taken trade re­stric­tive mea­sures, with­out ac­knowl­edg­ing them or jus­ti­fy­ing them un­der the WTO rules.</p>
    <p>These mea­sures raise se­ri­ous ques­tions re­gard­ing China’s ad­her­ence to the WTO rules on non-dis­crim­i­na­tion, trans­parency, ap­pro­pri­ate use of trade rem­edy laws, and “en­sur­ing reg­u­la­tions shall not be more trade-re­stric­tive than nec­es­sary to ful­fil a le­git­i­mate ob­jec­tive” – which in­cludes “na­tional se­cu­rity re­quire­ments, the pro­tec­tion of hu­man health or safety, an­i­mal or plant life or health, or the en­vi­ron­ment”.</p>
    <p>WTO OBLI­GA­TIONS</p>
    <p>The time is ripe for the US, Aus­tralia and other trad­ing part­ners to join forces at re­gional gath­er­ings, and the WTO to make it clear to Bei­jing that trade re­stric­tive mea­sures, whether for­mal or in­for­mal, pub­licly de­clared or not, are unac­cept­able and raise se­ri­ous con­cerns with re­gards to China’s ad­her­ence to its WTO obli­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Up­com­ing meet­ings of the WTO’s gen­eral coun­cil and the run-up to the for­mal WTO trade pol­icy re­view of China in July next year could pro­vide im­por­tant venues to col­lec­tively call Bei­jing out on its in­frac­tions.</p>
    <p>At a min­i­mum, rules on trans­parency re­quire clear ex­pla­na­tions based on science or fact when China cur­tails im­ports. If such mea­sures con­tinue to be swept un­der the rug or ex­cused as the cost of do­ing busi­ness with China, it only sends a green light to Chi­nese lead­ers that such be­hav­iour is cost-free.</p>
    <p>If China is as com­mit­ted to the rules-based sys­tem as its lead­ers con­tend, Bei­jing will have no choice but to act in line with the let­ter and spirit of its in­ter­na­tional obli­ga­tions by hav­ing its deeds match its rhetoric.</p>
    <p>This use of non-trans­par­ent re­stric­tions to pun­ish other coun­tries for their poli­cies goes against the let­ter and spirit of the rules-based trad­ing sys­tem, and calls into ques­tion the value of con­clud­ing free trade agree­ments with Bei­jing, as Can­berra and</p>
    <p>Seoul have done.</p>
