    <p>Covid-19 has taken a heavy toll on health­care work­ers in In­done­sia, rob­bing the na­tion of vi­tal ex­per­tise as the num­ber of cases soars. The Covid-19 mor­tal­ity rate for doc­tors in In­done­sia is the high­est in South-east Asia, ac­cord­ing to the In­done­sian Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian doc­tor Berkatnu In­drawan Jan­guk was de­ter­mined to be­come a spe­cial­ist in in­ter­nal medicine, but was robbed of the op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old died on April 27 of Covid-19 af­ter com­ing into con­tact with a pa­tient at Dr Mo­hamad Soe­wand­hie Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal in Surabaya – In­done­sia’s sec­ond­largest city – in East Java.</p>
    <p>“At that time, the emer­gency units for Covid-19 pa­tients and those suf­fer­ing from other ill­nesses were not yet sep­a­rated,” Madam In­ri­aty Karawa­heni, Dr Berkatnu’s mother, told The Straits Times over the phone from her home in Muara Teweh, Cen­tral Kal­i­man­tan.</p>
    <p>“Ini­tially, he only used a sur­gi­cal mask, and only later wore full per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment (PPE),” said the mother of two, who also lost her hus­band to Covid-19 two months af­ter her son died.</p>
    <p>The dis­ease has taken a heavy toll on health­care work­ers in In­done­sia. Dr Berkatnu was one of 105 doc­tors who suc­cumbed to Covid-19, and the Na­tional Nurses As­so­ci­a­tion of In­done­sia said at least 71 of its mem­bers have died.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s Covid-19 mor­tal­ity rate for doc­tors is the high­est in South-east Asia, the In­done­sian Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion (IDI) said.</p>
    <p>Amnesty In­ter­na­tional put In­done­sia in third place, af­ter Rus­sia and Egypt, for the coun­tries with the high­est Covid-19 mor­tal­ity rates for health work­ers.</p>
    <p>A short­age of PPEs was a huge prob­lem in the early days of the pan­demic, but IDI deputy chair­man Adib Khu­maidi said a new set of fac­tors, such as the huge work­load and the ab­sence of in­fra­struc­ture at most hos­pi­tals to tackle in­fec­tious dis­eases, is now con­tribut­ing to the deaths.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­por­tant to man­age work­ing hours and as­sign a num­ber of hos­pi­tals to specif­i­cally han­dle Covid-19 pa­tients, as that will re­duce the ex­po­sure of all health work­ers to the virus,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore the pan­demic, doc­tors were al­ready un­der tremen­dous pres­sure in the world’s fourth most pop­u­lous na­tion, with 270 mil­lion peo­ple. Some 184,000 doc­tors were strug­gling to cope with pa­tients at hos­pi­tals, es­pe­cially pub­lic ones.</p>
    <p>Dr Berkatnu, for in­stance, could be su­per­vis­ing up to 90 pa­tients in an eight-hour shift, ac­cord­ing to his mother.</p>
    <p>Dr Sutrisno, chair­man of IDI’s chap­ter in East Java, which has the most doc­tor deaths across all of In­done­sia’s 34 prov­inces, echoed Dr Adib’s views, say­ing: “The greater the load of pa­tients, the higher the con­cen­tra­tion of the virus. Health work­ers po­ten­tially have a higher risk of get­ting in­fected with long ex­po­sure to it, no mat­ter how healthy they are.”</p>
    <p>Dr Tri Ma­ha­rani, head of the emer­gency unit at Daha Hu­sada Hos­pi­tal in Kediri, East Java, noted that doc­tors could not re­ject any­one who went to a hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>“We are like in a jun­gle, not know­ing if pa­tients are pos­i­tive or neg­a­tive (for the virus),” said Dr Tri, who is a Covid-19 sur­vivor.</p>
    <p>Amnesty In­ter­na­tional In­done­sia di­rec­tor Us­man Hamid noted that the num­ber of In­done­sian health work­ers dy­ing has dou­bled since mid-July.</p>
    <p>“Their rights to life and health are clearly ne­glected. We urge the gov­ern­ment to pro­tect their rights to safety at the work­place more se­ri­ously,” he said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Epi­demi­ol­o­gists warn that the bat­tle against Covid-19 in In­done­sia will be long and tough, six months af­ter the coun­try de­clared its first cases.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of cases has spiked since June, when so­cial re­stric­tions were eased. As at yes­ter­day, the coun­try has re­ported 194,109 in­fec­tions and 8,025 deaths, with daily cases sur­pass­ing 3,000 since last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>A na­tion­wide survey of 1,461 health work­ers con­ducted by the Univer­sity of In­done­sia’s Fac­ulty of Medicine found an over­whelm­ing num­ber, or 82 per cent, re­port­ing that they had ex­pe­ri­enced a mod­er­ate level of burnout.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia’s Covid-19 mit­i­ga­tion task force spokesman Wiku Adis­as­mito said his team has tried to en­sure the safety of health work­ers by mak­ing sure they have ac­cess to in­ter­na­tion­ally stan­dard­ised PPE.</p>
    <p>“We also re­mind each hos­pi­tal to pro­vide full pro­tec­tion to health work­ers tack­ling Covid-19 pa­tients by way of lim­it­ing work hours to avert ex­haus­tion lead­ing to re­duced im­mu­nity,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Last Sat­ur­day, cit­i­zen coali­tion La­por Covid-19 launched a dig­i­tal grave­yard to pay trib­ute to the health work­ers who have lost their lives in the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The site will urge the gov­ern­ment to bet­ter pro­tect health work­ers and step up its ef­forts to con­trol the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It also hopes to ed­u­cate the pub­lic on re­spect for health work­ers, and to stop stig­ma­tis­ing them or their fam­i­lies and take the pan­demic more se­ri­ously, said Mr Ah­mad Arif, one of the coali­tion’s ini­tia­tors.</p>
