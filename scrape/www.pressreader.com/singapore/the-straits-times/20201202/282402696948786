    <p>LON­DON • A sick­en­ing clash of heads be­tween Wolver­hamp­ton Wan­der­ers’ Raul Jimenez and Ar­se­nal de­fender David Luiz which left the Mex­i­can striker with a frac­tured skull has prompted calls for foot­ball clubs to be able to make “con­cus­sion sub­sti­tu­tions”.</p>
    <p>Jimenez was knocked un­con­scious af­ter an ac­ci­den­tal col­li­sion with Brazil­ian Luiz, who rather sur­pris­ingly played on for an­other 40 min­utes un­til half-time with blood seep­ing through a head ban­dage.</p>
    <p>Jimenez, 29, needed oxy­gen on the pitch and was taken to hos­pi­tal for scans, even­tu­ally un­der­go­ing surgery for the skull frac­ture.</p>
    <p>“Thanks for your sup­port mes­sages,” he tweeted from his hos­pi­tal bed yes­ter­day. “I will be un­der ob­ser­va­tion, and I hope to re­turn to the pitch soon.”</p>
    <p>Ar­se­nal in­sisted that they fol­lowed Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (FA) pro­to­cols for head in­juries in al­low­ing the 33-year-old Brazil­ian to play on, with man­ager Mikel Arteta say­ing: “I just had news from David that the doc made all the tests and fol­lowed all the pro­to­cols to make sure that he was fine.</p>
    <p>“He re­sponded really well to all of them, but it was a nasty cut. David wanted to con­tinue and he con­tin­ued, but at half-time we de­cided to take him out be­cause he was un­com­fort­able head­ing the ball.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, the sit­u­a­tion raised ques­tions about whether enough was be­ing done to safe­guard play­ers’ wel­fare.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion Board, which is the sport’s law­maker, has opened the door for con­cus­sion sub­sti­tutes to be used on a trial ba­sis with the FA hop­ing to do so in this sea­son’s FA Cup. The FA is con­sid­er­ing fast-track­ing the trial to as early as this month.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool boss J ur­gen Klopp says he would sup­port such a move.</p>
    <p>“I know we have con­cus­sion pro­to­cols and I’m pretty sure Ar­se­nal did that. I’m not sure any rule would help in that mo­ment be­cause the player can play on,” he said on Mon­day when asked about con­cus­sion sub­sti­tutes.</p>
    <p>“But, yes, it makes sense that we can do things like this.”</p>
    <p>Manch­ester City boss Pep Guardi­ola called for clearer guide­lines on whether any head knock should re­sult in a player be­ing sub­sti­tuted, even if they pass the on-field con­cus­sion check by club doc­tors.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know the pro­to­cols,” said the Spa­niard.</p>
    <p>“Some of them say you have to be im­me­di­ately out, some of them say no. It should be clear be­cause in the head, it’s al­ways so dan­ger­ous.”</p>
    <p>NOT AC­CEPT­ABLE</p>
    <p>For­mer Eng­land cap­tain Alan Shearer, who re­cently hosted a doc­u­men­tary about pos­si­ble links be­tween a ca­reer head­ing a foot­ball and de­men­tia, said a change was long over­due.</p>
    <p>“Foot­ball needs to get real, it needs to wake up, it needs to get se­ri­ous. Not next year, next month, now. It’s not ac­cept­able, it has been go­ing too far too long,” he told the BBC.</p>
    <p>“They’re on about tri­alling con­cus­sion sub­sti­tutes. What is there to trial? It’s been go­ing on for years. It’s not ac­cept­able.”</p>
    <p>City goal­keeper Eder­son, who suf­fered a head in­jury and needed eight stitches af­ter be­ing caught by the boot of Liver­pool’s Sa­dio Mane in 2017, said such sit­u­a­tions re­quired spe­cial at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>“When there is a blow to the head, there should be a sub­sti­tu­tion – whether the player can con­tinue or not,” he added.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool de­fender Andy Robert­son said con­cus­sion sub­sti­tutes would get the back­ing of play­ers.</p>
    <p>“Con­cus­sion subs would make sense. It’s not a nat­u­ral in­jury get­ting con­cus­sion like that,” said Robert­son, who was in the Hull side when his then team­mate Ryan Ma­son suf­fered a frac­tured skull against Chelsea in 2017 that forced him to re­tire from foot­ball.</p>
    <p>“For me and the play­ers, that would make sense. Hope­fully that’s maybe some­thing that can come in.”</p>
    <p>FA rules state that if there is any sus­pi­cion of a player hav­ing suf­fered a con­cus­sion, the player must be re­moved from the field of play, and not al­lowed to re­turn.</p>
    <p>Brain in­jury as­so­ci­a­tion Head­way said Luiz should not have been al­lowed to play on.</p>
    <p>“You sim­ply can­not take a risk with head in­juries. They are not like mus­cle in­juries where you can put a player back on ‘to see if they can run it off’,” deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive Luke Griggs said.</p>
    <p>“One fur­ther blow to the head when con­cussed could have se­ri­ous con­se­quences.”</p>
    <p>Foot­ball needs to get real, it needs to wake up, it needs to get se­ri­ous. Not next year, next month, now. It’s not ac­cept­able, it has been go­ing too far too long.</p>
