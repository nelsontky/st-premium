    <p>OR­LANDO • After drop­ping Game 3 of their Western Con­fer­ence Series against the Los An­ge­les Clip­pers 130-122 on Fri­day, the Dal­las Mav­er­icks are hop­ing they have not also lost Luka Don­cic to in­jury for the rest of the series.</p>
    <p>The All-Star guard twisted his an­kle de­fend­ing a driv­ing Kawhi Leonard in the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>He hopped to the side­line and was helped to the locker room, re­turn­ing in the fourth quar­ter with his an­kle heav­ily taped.</p>
    <p>In his brief re­turn, the guard pol­ished off a triple-dou­ble of 13 points, 10 re­bounds and 10 as­sists – the first by a Dal­las player in the play-offs.</p>
    <p>But he came up limp­ing again with just over nine min­utes re­main­ing and could not con­tinue.</p>
    <p>While the 21-year-old in­sisted the “lit­tle sprain” was “not that bad” – he was set to have an MRI exam yes­ter­day – coach Rick Carlisle said he did not know what the Slove­nian’s sta­tus would be for</p>
    <p>Game 4. The Mav­er­icks are look­ing to even up the series to­day in Disney World near Or­lando and that would be a mam­moth task with­out Don­cic, who they have built a league-lead­ing of­fence around.</p>
    <p>In the first two post-sea­son games of his bur­geon­ing ca­reer, Don­cic av­er­aged 35 points and eight as­sists with a 70.2 per cent shoot­ing rate de­spite fac­ing two of the best two-way play­ers in Leonard and Paul Ge­orge.</p>
    <p>If Don­cic is un­able to start, big man Kristaps Porzingis, who reg­is­tered 34 points and 13 re­bounds on Fri­day, will have to shoul­der most of the Mav­er­icks’ of­fen­sive load.</p>
    <p>Seth Curry added 22 on nine-of-11 shoot­ing, and Tim Har­d­away Jr also scored 22 for the Mav­er­icks.</p>
    <p>“We’ll look at ev­ery­thing,” Carlisle said.</p>
    <p>“You play a team like the Clip­pers, you’ve got to be ready to throw the kitchen sink at them.”</p>
    <p>Leonard scored 36 points, grabbed nine re­bounds and dished out eight as­sists, lead­ing seven Clip­pers play­ers in dou­ble fig­ures on points scored. Mon­trezl Har­rell added 13 points, while Ge­orge had 11 on three-of-16 shoot­ing.</p>
    <p>Leonard backed Ge­orge to re­gain his shoot­ing touch after he went seven-for-33, in­clud­ing three-for-18 in three-point at­tempts in the last two games com­bined.</p>
    <p>“We all start from scratch again Game 4,” he said. “He’s a con­fi­dent player, he’s go­ing to turn it around. We got his back.”</p>
    <p>The Utah Jazz also hold a 2-1 series ad­van­tage after cruis­ing past the Den­ver Nuggets 124-87.</p>
    <p>In the East­ern Con­fer­ence, de­fend­ing cham­pi­ons Toronto Rap­tors pum­melled the Brook­lyn Nets 117-92 while the Bos­ton Celtics had to claw past a de­ter­mined Philadel­phia 102-94. Both lead 3-0 and can close out their series to­day.</p>
