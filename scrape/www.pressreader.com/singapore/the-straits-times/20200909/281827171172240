    <p>PETALING JAYA • About 200 Malaysians were stranded for hours at the Kuala Lumpur In­ter­na­tional Air­port (KLIA) amid con­fu­sion over a new rul­ing bar­ring en­try to peo­ple from 23 coun­tries, and claims that there were no ho­tel rooms to quar­an­tine the ar­rivals.</p>
    <p>The Malaysians were made to stay i nside the air­port wait­ing lounges for more than 10 hours on Mon­day as ground staff – in­clud­ing air­line em­ploy­ees, air­port per­son­nel and im­mi­gra­tion of­fi­cers – tried to sort out whether the new rul­ing ap­plied to the group.</p>
    <p>How­ever, when con­tacted, im­mi­gra­tion of­fi­cers said it was clear that Malaysians with all the proper doc­u­ments would be al­lowed en­try.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter Is­mail Sabri Yaakob said the travel ban im­posed on peo­ple from 23 coun­tries with a high num­ber of Covid-19 cases does not ap­ply to Malaysians re­turn­ing from th­ese places.</p>
    <p>Ms Jo­lene Yap, who was among 50 Malaysians who ar­rived from Bri­tain at about 6.30am on Mon­day, claimed that when she and the oth­ers dis­em­barked, they were stopped from get­ting to the im­mi­gra­tion coun­ters de­spite show­ing let­ters of ap­proval from the High Com­mis­sion of Malaysia in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>“At first, we were stopped be­cause the ground staff were not sure whether Malaysians were al­lowed en­try un­der the new rul­ing,” she said. “Af­ter hours of wait­ing, an of­fi­cer from the Na­tional Dis­as­ter Man­age­ment Agency (Nadma) said that they could not find ho­tel rooms for us to be quar­an­tined in.”</p>
    <p>They were later given the tele­phone num­bers of ho­tels and told to book their own rooms.</p>
    <p>“De­spite all of us call­ing the same list of num­bers, we were told by the ho­tels – when we did man­age to get through – that only Nadma can book rooms for quar­an­tine and we can­not do it our­selves,” Ms Yap said.</p>
    <p>At about 4pm, Ms Yap said she and her fel­low pas­sen­gers were in­formed by Nadma that rooms were avail­able for them and they were then moved to the quar­an­tine sta­tions.</p>
    <p>The Malaysians were made to stay inside the air­port wait­ing lounges for more than 10 hours on Mon­day as ground staff – in­clud­ing air­line em­ploy­ees, air­port per­son­nel and im­mi­gra­tion of­fi­cers – tried to sort out whether the new rul­ing ap­plied to the group.</p>
