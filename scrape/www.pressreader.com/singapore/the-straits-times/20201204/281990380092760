    <p>As a Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) alumna, I ap­pre­ci­ate and ap­plaud the univer­sity’s on­go­ing ef­forts to crack down on what ap­pears to be sex­ual ha­rass­ment on cam­pus, as well as to in­crease trans­parency on how it han­dles the cases.</p>
    <p>I, as well as many other Sin­ga­pore­ans, had been hor­ri­fied by what seemed like at­tempts by NUS to down­play pre­vi­ous in­ci­dents of ha­rass­ment or voyeurism. Its more re­cent, up­front ap­proach – I re­ceived an e-mail on Tues­day with a de­scrip­tion of the Pro­fes­sor Theodore Hopf case and how he had been dealt with, be­fore the news came out – is a much-needed change, one that re­flects the im­por­tance of pro­mot­ing cam­pus safety and jus­tice. It also helps to re­pair pub­lic trust and con­fi­dence in NUS.</p>
    <p>Nonethe­less, pre­ven­tion is al­ways bet­ter than cure. Vic­tims of sex­ual ha­rass­ment suf­fer trauma that might ap­pear to be su­per­fi­cial or not be ap­par­ent im­me­di­ately af­ter the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>But the im­pact is likely to linger long af­ter, es­pe­cially when the vic­tim is an im­pres­sion­able young per­son whose trust in a teacher or au­thor­ity fig­ure turned out to be mis­placed.</p>
    <p>NUS has a writ­ten code of</p>
    <p>con­duct for staff and stu­dents (copies of which were ap­pended to the e-mail I re­ceived from the alumni of­fice), but it is of lit­tle use if staff and stu­dents are sim­ply asked to read it on their own.</p>
    <p>That sev­eral ha­rass­ment or as­sault cases have been re­ported re­cently shows that ex­ist­ing mea­sures have been grossly in­ad­e­quate, even as they, iron­i­cally, in­di­cate that stu­dents are now more aware of their rights.</p>
    <p>What might be more ef­fec­tive is for man­age­ment to proac­tively en­sure staff know what they should and shouldn’t do by, for ex­am­ple, hold­ing manda­tory on­line re­fresher cour­ses once a year. Stu­dents ought to be well ed­u­cated about their rights, how to pro­tect them­selves and who to ap­proach on cam­pus if they are ha­rassed.</p>
    <p>The cases that have been re­ported could just be the prover­bial tip of the ice­berg –</p>
    <p>many vic­tims could have kept mum due to fear, shame or youth­ful ig­no­rance. Preda­tory, op­por­tunis­tic in­di­vid­u­als might be em­bold­ened as a re­sult.</p>
    <p>We owe it to our chil­dren to pro­vide them with a safe en­vi­ron­ment for learn­ing where ha­rass­ment or even as­sault should be the least of their con­cerns.</p>
    <p>NUS ur­gently needs to do more about cam­pus safety.</p>
