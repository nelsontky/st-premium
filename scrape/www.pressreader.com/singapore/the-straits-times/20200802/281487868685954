    <p>Mr James Thoo can­not re­mem­ber when he got mar­ried.</p>
    <p>“Oh my good­ness. I should know this thing,” he says, flus­tered. He throws out fig­ures hes­i­tantly – eight years ago, 10 years – then set­tles, with a sigh of fi­nal­ity, on four (you find out later the year 2016 is tat­tooed on his left arm).</p>
    <p>But when it comes to his ninemonth-old daugh­ter Zoe, the num­bers slide out ef­fort­lessly – she was born on Nov 1 last year.</p>
    <p>He proudly an­nounces that she is in the 97th per­centile on the in­fant growth charts – which makes her much big­ger than av­er­age – while com­plain­ing that she re­jects his home­made por­ridge.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old screen­writer turns up for his photo shoot wear­ing a cus­tom-made T-shirt with a photo of Zoe and the words “fu­ture leg­end” in fat cap­i­tal let­ters.</p>
    <p>On the sur­face, he looks like another be­sot­ted new fa­ther, but his ob­ses­sion is war­ranted. Zoe is a mir­a­cle, a hard-fought tro­phy wrested from the arms of the fickle fer­til­ity gods.</p>
    <p>In a new book ti­tled Palooka: 12 Rounds To Fa­ther­hood, Mr Thoo chron­i­cles the in-vitro fer­til­i­sa­tion (IVF) jour­ney he and his wife went through and con­fronts his bat­tered mas­culin­ity. It is a rare look at the is­sues from a hus­band’s per­spec­tive, rather than that of a doc­tor or wife, but writ­ten with laugh-out­loud, self-dep­re­cat­ing hu­mour that mil­len­ni­als can re­late to.</p>
    <p>The ti­tle ref­er­ences the slang term for a medi­ocre or clumsy boxer – Mr Thoo boxed pro­fes­sion­ally for a pe­riod in his 20s – and each of the 12 chap­ters is pref­aced by the retelling of a his­toric or mem­o­rable match which has par­al­lels to his fight for fa­ther­hood.</p>
    <p>The book’s launch in May seems timely in a pan­demic that has dis­rupted lives glob­ally.</p>
    <p>According to a study pub­lished in Science mag­a­zine last month, fer­til­ity rates are pro­jected to fall in the short term as economies con­tract and cou­ples post­pone baby-mak­ing plans. Lock­downs around the world have also forced fer­til­ity treat­ments to be post­poned or can­celled, re­sult­ing in time lost in re­pro­duc­tive cy­cles.</p>
    <p>The book also comes in the wake of a global de­cline in male fer­til­ity rates over the last 40 years. One in 20 young men now have a low sperm count that makes it dif­fi­cult for them to have chil­dren, according to Pro­fes­sor Christo­pher Bar­ratt, an expert on re­pro­duc­tive medicine at the Uni­ver­sity of Dundee in Scot­land and for­mer di­rec­tor of the male fer­til­ity expert work­ing group at the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, who spoke to The Straits Times last year.</p>
    <p>A self-con­fessed “baby-whis­per­ing lu­natic”, Mr Thoo says he had longed to be a fa­ther since he was a boy.</p>
    <p>After six months of try­ing for a baby, fer­til­ity tests re­vealed that he had l ow sperm motil­ity, which means there are in­suf­fi­cient healthy sperm to fer­tilise an egg. It was a be­low-the-belt blow which he never ex­pected.</p>
    <p>“I guess it’s em­bar­rass­ing for men to cop to in­fer­til­ity. It is one of the most fun­da­men­tal func­tions of be­ing a man – the abil­ity to sire a child,” he writes in the book. “If you can’t do that, then what are you?”</p>
    <p>His wife Ali­cia, a 32-year-old pri­vate banker, also had a low­erthan-av­er­age num­ber of eggs, a con­di­tion called di­min­ished ovar­ian re­serve.</p>
    <p>They opted for IVF im­me­di­ately in 2018 and went through two cy­cles over about a year, spend­ing some $60,000 in all.</p>
    <p>The book’s ges­ta­tion took place dur­ing the long waits at the doc­tor’s clinic, where he found it “cathar­tic” to doc­u­ment the ex­pe­ri­ence. He de­scribes the IVF process in the book as “one pro­longed up­per­cut to the scro­tum”.</p>
    <p>“You think you’re just going to show up at a clinic and they’ll take the eggs and fer­tilise them and so on and so forth. In re­al­ity what you have to do is Ethan Hunt your way through about 16 dif­fer­ent chal­lenges before you even get to look at the eggs,” he writes, re­fer­ring to the lead char­ac­ter in the Mis­sion: Im­pos­si­ble spy movie se­ries (1996 to present).</p>
    <p>When he posted about the book on so­cial me­dia, friends and ac­quain­tances sent mes­sages like, “Dude, what the hell are you do­ing?” and “Se­ri­ously, you’re telling peo­ple about this?”, he re­calls.</p>
    <p>Be­cause he was open about his strug­gles, other men fac­ing the same is­sues grav­i­tated to­wards him.</p>
    <p>They tended to be ac­quain­tances who would ap­proach him “late in the night” dur­ing so­cial oc­ca­sions and con­fide that they, too, were going through I VF with their spouses, something they had not told any­one else.</p>
    <p>“I find it i ncred­i­bly sad that peo­ple are going through these prob­lems and clearly want to talk about it, but feel that they can’t,” he says.</p>
    <p>“I stay as quiet as pos­si­ble and let them speak about it. And then do what I hope the book does, which is em­pathise and share the ex­pe­ri­ence, you know, I’ve been through the ex­act same thing and I get it and it sucks. And the peo­ple who haven’t been through it don’t get it.”</p>
    <p>While he ac­knowl­edges that “Asian men have it the hard­est when it comes to talk­ing about things like this”, he feels that be­ing vul­ner­a­ble is worth it.</p>
    <p>“I’ve never had a sin­gle bad ex­pe­ri­ence with telling some­body about my is­sues, that I’m...,” he pauses and in­hales sharply, then con­tin­ues, “...al­most com­pletely in­fer­tile.”</p>
    <p>The “soul-crush­ing” un­cer­tainty of IVF was the most stress­ful part of the jour­ney, he says.</p>
    <p>“If you said you’ll have to do all these things 10 times and then in five years you’ll def­i­nitely have a kid, it would have been a breeze, hon­estly. Be­cause I would know that we would have a baby in the end.</p>
    <p>“But to go through it and not know if it will ever work, or ever hap­pen for us...,” he says, his voice trail­ing off.</p>
    <p>“Even when Ali­cia was first preg­nant, up un­til the day she gave birth, I was still wor­ried. Even the day after, when Zoe had jaun­dice.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides phys­i­cally de­mand­ing prepa­ra­tions, like help­ing to ad­min­is­ter 100 fer­til­ity med­i­ca­tion in­jec­tions in a month to his wife, their jour­ney was fraught with hard­hit­ting mo­ments.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the first round of im­plan­ta­tion, Mrs Thoo suf­fered a mis­car­riage as well as an ec­topic preg­nancy, where the fer­tilised egg im­plants in the wrong place. It en­dan­gered her life and she had to un­dergo emer­gency surgery.</p>
    <p>“The emo­tional and men­tal ero­sion of re­peated IVF fail­ures on a per­son is gru­elling to a level that is com­pletely un­fath­omable to any­one who has not them­selves ex­pe­ri­enced it. To sub­ject some­one to its psy­cho­log­i­cal tolls, months at a time, is i ncred­i­bly painful,” Mr Thoo writes in the book.</p>
    <p>He was keenly aware that his wife was the metaphor­i­cal prize fighter in the ring, and he, the sup­port­ive as­sis­tant in the cor­ner whose job was to be “as pos­i­tive as pos­si­ble and not get mired i n the self­loathing, or at least shield Ali­cia from it”, he says.</p>
    <p>Mrs Thoo also suf­fered from morn­ing sick­ness through­out her preg­nancy.</p>
    <p>That is why he sees his happy end­ing not in the birth of their baby, but in the “re­newed ap­pre­ci­a­tion for my wife and ev­ery­thing that I do have in my life”.</p>
    <p>Mrs Thoo also no­ticed the trans­for­ma­tion – from her hus­band ini­tially want­ing a child more, to him later wor­ry­ing about her dis­ap­point­ment at not be­ing able to have one.</p>
    <p>“I think it made me love him more through the whole process,” she gushes.</p>
    <p>Both agree that cou­ples must al­ready have clear and open com­mu­ni­ca­tion to weather the mul­ti­ple stresses of IVF. It will “make any prob­lem in­stantly sig­nif­i­cantly more man­age­able”, he says.</p>
    <p>With four more vi­able eggs in stor­age, they are ea­ger to try for baby No. 2 when their doc­tor says they are ready to rumble.</p>
    <p>While he is “ex­tremely ex­cited” about try­ing again for a child, he also bears “a lot of guilt” about the fi­nan­cial bur­den, which will fall mainly on his wife.</p>
    <p>The hands-on dad has put his screen­writ­ing projects on hold to take care of Zoe, while his wife works from home dur­ing phase two.</p>
    <p>You can hear the hurt in his voice as he con­fesses that de­spite his ef­forts, Zoe prefers mummy to him. It makes him feel that he is “fail­ing as a dad be­cause it’s re­ally not as easy as I thought it would be”.</p>
    <p>Still, he is ready to roll with the punches of fa­ther­hood.</p>
    <p>“I’ve never met an only child who was happy they were an only child,” he says. “For Zoe’s sake, it would be nice to have a sib­ling.”</p>
