    <p>JAKARTA • The In­done­sian Na­tional Po­lice’s Crim­i­nal In­ves­ti­ga­tion Depart­ment (Bareskrim) has ar­rested Anita Kolopak­ing, the lawyer of graft con­vict Djoko Su­gia­rto Tjan­dra.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Po­lice spokesman Awi Setiy­ono said on Satur­day that in­ves­ti­ga­tors ar­rested Anita af­ter she was ques­tioned as a sus­pect the day be­fore.</p>
    <p>The in­ter­ro­ga­tion lasted un­til early on Satur­day, and the lawyer an­swered 55 questions from in­ves­ti­ga­tors. “Anita will be de­tained in Bareskrim’s de­ten­tion cen­tre for the next 20 days,” Bri­gadier-Gen­eral Awi said, as quoted by kom­pas.com</p>
    <p>Bareskrim pre­vi­ously named Anita as a sus­pect on July 30 and brought mul­ti­ple charges against her for her al­leged role in us­ing forged let­ters to travel and help­ing a crim­i­nal on the run.</p>
    <p>The Supreme Court sen­tenced Djoko to two years in prison in 2009 for his in­volve­ment in the high­pro­file Bank Bali cor­rup­tion case.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the busi­ness­man fled to Pa­pua New Guinea a day be­fore the court rul­ing.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a decade as a fugi­tive, Djoko man­aged to re­turn to In­done­sia un­de­tected, had new iden­tity doc­u­ments is­sued as well as filed for a case re­view of his two-year prison sen­tence with the South Jakarta District Court.</p>
    <p>The case im­pli­cated three high-rank­ing po­lice gen­er­als, who were re­moved for their al­leged role in help­ing the con­vict travel within the coun­try.</p>
    <p>One of the three, Bri­gadier-Gen­eral Prase­tyo Utomo, was named as a sus­pect by the po­lice for al­legedly is­su­ing forged travel let­ters for Djoko and Anita in his ca­pac­ity as the head of Bareskrim’s Civil Ser­vant In­ves­ti­ga­tor Su­per­vi­sory and Co­or­di­na­tion Bureau.</p>
    <p>Mr Asep Suba­han, the sub-district head of South Gro­gol in West Jakarta, was also dis­missed for al­legedly is­su­ing an e-ID card for Djoko.</p>
    <p>The po­lice even­tu­ally ar­rested Djoko in Malaysia on July 30 and brought him back home.</p>
