    <p>The Dis­com­fort Of Evening, a story of child­hood grief that re­view­ers have called both “dis­turb­ing” and “ex­cep­tional”, was named on Wed­nes­day as the win­ner of the In­ter­na­tional Booker Prize, the pres­ti­gious award for fic­tion trans­lated into English. Marieke Lu­cas Ri­jn­eveld (be­low), the book’s au­thor, shares the prize of £50,000 (S$90,185) with Michele Hutchi­son, who trans­lated it from the orig­i­nal Dutch.</p>
    <p>LON­DON • The Dis­com­fort Of Evening (left), a story of child­hood grief that re­view­ers have called both “dis­turb­ing” and “ex­cep­tional”, was named on Wed­nes­day as the win­ner of the In­ter­na­tional Booker Prize, the pres­ti­gious award for fic­tion trans­lated into English.</p>
    <p>Marieke Lu­cas Ri­jn­eveld, the book’s au­thor, shares the prize of £50,000 (S$90,185) with Michele Hutchi­son, who trans­lated it from the orig­i­nal Dutch.</p>
    <p>Mr Ted Hodgkin­son, the chair of the judg­ing panel, said in a state­ment that The Dis­com­fort Of Evening was “a ten­der and vis­ceral evo­ca­tion of a child­hood caught be­tween shame and sal­va­tion, and a deeply de­serv­ing win­ner”.</p>
    <p>The an­nual In­ter­na­tional Booker Prize is ad­min­is­tered by the same foun­da­tion as the Booker Prize, which is awarded for fic­tion writ­ten in English.</p>
    <p>To be el­i­gi­ble for the In­ter­na­tional Booker, a trans­lated book must be pub­lished in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Past win­ners have in­cluded The Veg­e­tar­ian by South Korean writer</p>
    <p>Han Kang and Flights by Olga Tokar­czuk, who was sub­se­quently awarded the No­bel Prize in Lit­er­a­ture.</p>
    <p>The Dis­com­fort Of Evening, pub­lished in the United States this month, was cho­sen from a short­list that in­cluded Yoko Ogawa’s The Mem­ory Po­lice, a dystopian tale that was a fi­nal­ist for last year’s Na­tional Book Award for Trans­lated Lit­er­a­ture; and Daniel Kehlmann’s Tyll, about a 17th-cen­tury j es­ter who trav­els around Europe and which is be­ing adapted for Net­flix.</p>
    <p>The Dis­com­fort Of Evening, Ri­jn­eveld’s first novel, was a best­seller in the Nether­lands when pub­lished there in 2018.</p>
    <p>The book is set among a re­li­gious Dutch fam­ily liv­ing on a dairy farm in the early 2000s. It tells the story of Jas, a 10-year-old girl whose brother dies in an ice-skat­ing ac­ci­dent, and fol­lows her fam­ily’s strug­gle with grief.</p>
    <p>Ri­jn­eveld, 29, who uses the pro­nouns they and them, grew up on a dairy farm and was three when their 12-year-old brother was hit and killed by a bus on the way to school.</p>
    <p>The book con­tains graphic de­pic­tions of an­i­mal abuse and of Jas and her sib­lings’ sex­ual awak­en­ing.</p>
    <p>Hutchi­son, the trans­la­tor, said in an in­ter­view with The New York Times this year that she found it hard work­ing on some of those scenes.</p>
    <p>“I’d tend not to do those pas­sages at the end of the day, in case I would get night­mares,” she said.</p>
    <p>Many crit­ics in Bri­tain, where the book was widely re­viewed on its pub­li­ca­tion in March, high­lighted the book’s dis­turb­ing scenes in re­views, while prais­ing the im­pact of Ri­jn­eveld’s sto­ry­telling.</p>
    <p>So­phie Rat­cliffe, writ­ing in The Daily Tele­graph, called the novel “a para­ble to shake us from sen­ti­ment”.</p>
    <p>“I can’t imag­ine giv­ing it to any­body. No­body would want to read this book,” Rat­cliffe said. But, she added: “I think many of us need to.”</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with The New York Times in April, Ri­jn­eveld said they had grown up in a re­li­gious fam­ily and used to con­fide in God with their strug­gles. Now, Ri­jn­eveld said: “I’m try­ing to do the same thing by writ­ing that I did as a child by pray­ing: hop­ing, de­sir­ing and ask­ing for some re­lief.”</p>
