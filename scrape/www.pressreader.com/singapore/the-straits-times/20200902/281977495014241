    <p>A youth who flung a metal mug at his fam­ily’s maid, frac­tur­ing her nose, was yes­ter­day sen­tenced to at least six months’ re­for­ma­tive train­ing.</p>
    <p>This means Ng Jia Sheng, now 20, will be de­tained at a cen­tre and fol­low a strict reg­i­men that in­cludes foot drills and coun­selling.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean pleaded guilty in June to us­ing crim­i­nal force on Ms Esta­billo Soledad Agustin in 2018, as well as caus­ing griev­ous hurt by per­form­ing a rash act.</p>
    <p>He also ad­mit­ted to us­ing in­sult­ing words on the 41-year-old Filip­ina that caused her alarm, which is an of­fence un­der the Pro­tec­tion from Ha­rass­ment Act.</p>
    <p>Ms Agustin has since re­turned to the Philip­pines. Court doc­u­ments said Ng and Ms Agustin were in­volved in a dis­pute at his fam­ily home in Green­wood Av­enue near Dun­earn Road on June 7, 2018.</p>
    <p>Ng had asked the maid to turn on the air-con­di­tioner and be­came an­gry when she replied in “an ir­ri­tated man­ner”.</p>
    <p>They then got into an ar­gu­ment af­ter Ms Agustin switched it on and threw the con­troller on a ta­ble.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments said the ar­gu­ment es­ca­lated to the point where both par­ties were shout­ing at each other. The youth then spat in Ms Agustin’s face. She re­sponded in kind.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Zhou Yi­hong had ear­lier said: “Dur­ing the al­ter­ca­tion, the ac­cused told the vic­tim that she was only a maid, was poor and had no right to be in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>The DPP added that Ng fol­lowed Ms Agustin to the kitchen af­ter his father in­ter­vened and sep­a­rated both of them.</p>
    <p>Ng then picked up a metal mug, threw it at the maid and it struck her face.</p>
    <p>She started cry­ing and re­tal­i­ated by throw­ing var­i­ous ob­jects such as plas­tic medicine bot­tles and a plas­tic jug at Ng, be­fore his brother re­strained her. None of the items she threw hit Ng.</p>
    <p>Ms Agustin then went out­side the gate of the house and told an­other maid to call the po­lice.</p>
    <p>She was ex­am­ined by a doc­tor at Tan Tock Seng Hospi­tal later that day, and was found to have suf­fered mul­ti­ple fa­cial in­juries, in­clud­ing a frac­ture in her nose.</p>
    <p>Ng is now out on bail of $10,000 and will have to sur­ren­der him­self at the State Courts on Nov 20 to be­gin serv­ing his sen­tence.</p>
    <p>For caus­ing griev­ous hurt by a rash act, the most se­ri­ous charge that Ng faced, an of­fender can be jailed for up to four years and fined up to $10,000.</p>
