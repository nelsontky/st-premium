    <p>A doc­tor is ac­cused of in­sult­ing the mod­esty of hun­dreds of women at var­i­ous lo­ca­tions is­land­wide.</p>
    <p>Chu Ben Wee, who is now in re­mand, ap­peared in a district court via video link yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old Sin­ga­porean al­legedly used a Go­Pro camera at­tached to his shoe to record up­skirt videos of 184 women in April last year.</p>
    <p>By us­ing a sim­i­lar method, he is said to have tar­geted more than 300 women three months later.</p>
    <p>He faces 17 charges in to­tal, mainly for sim­i­lar of­fences.</p>
    <p>Chu, who is rep­re­sented by lawyer Luke Lee, was ex­pected to plead guilty yes­ter­day but the case has been ad­journed.</p>
    <p>He is now ex­pected to ad­mit to the al­leged of­fences next Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments do not say how his al­leged of­fences came to light.</p>
    <p>As at yes­ter­day, Chu’s name is still on the list of reg­is­tered health­care pro­fes­sion­als in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>For each count of in­sult­ing a woman’s mod­esty, an of­fender can be jailed for up to a year and fined.</p>
    <p>Chu is not the only doc­tor this year to face the court over un­law­ful videos.</p>
    <p>In April, a former doc­tor was sen­tenced to a manda­tory treat­ment or­der for a year af­ter record­ing mul­ti­ple videos of men us­ing uri­nals in Fe­bru­ary last year.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian na­tional Jerry Chris­tian Na­ga­pu­tra, then 31, has to un­dergo treat­ment for his men­tal con­di­tion in lieu of jail time.</p>
    <p>His lawyer Lee Teck Leng told the court that his client had “ad­just­ment dis­or­der with de­pressed and anx­ious moods”.</p>
    <p>Na­ga­pu­tra pleaded guilty on March 9 to three charges un­der the Films Act. Twenty other sim­i­lar charges were taken into con­sid­er­a­tion dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
