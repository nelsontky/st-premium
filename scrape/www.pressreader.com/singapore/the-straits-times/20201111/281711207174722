    <p>Bugis Street, Mustafa Cen­tre, Jurong Point and Kitch­ener Com­plex were among new sites vis­ited by coro­n­avirus pa­tients while they were in­fec­tious, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Bugis Street was vis­ited on three sep­a­rate oc­ca­sions – be­tween 8.15pm and 11pm on Nov 1, be­tween 3.30pm and 6.55pm on Nov 3, and be­tween 11.45am and 3.20pm on Nov 8.</p>
    <p>Mustafa Cen­tre was vis­ited on Nov 3, a Burger King out­let at Kitch­ener Com­plex was vis­ited on Nov 4, and Jurong Point was vis­ited on Nov 5.</p>
    <p>A Ko­pi­tiam out­let in Jurong East was vis­ited on Nov 6 and Nov 8.</p>
    <p>These were among lo­ca­tions newly added to a list of places vis­ited by pa­tients in the com­mu­nity dur­ing their in­fec­tious pe­riod.</p>
    <p>MOH pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes, and the times they vis­ited them, to get peo­ple who were at these places at the same time to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on the gov.sg web­site.</p>
    <p>MOH has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>It an­nounced nine new Covid-19 pa­tients here yes­ter­day, of which one was a pa­tient from the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>The sole com­mu­nity case was a 25-year-old Malaysian na­tional who last worked as a cleaner on Nov 2, said MOH.</p>
    <p>He de­vel­oped symp­toms a day later and sought med­i­cal treat­ment at a gen­eral prac­ti­tioner clinic, where he was tested for Covid-19 un­der en­hanced com­mu­nity test­ing. His case is un­linked.</p>
    <p>Of the nine cases, seven were im­ported, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>They com­prised one Sin­ga­porean, one per­ma­nent res­i­dent, two work per­mit hold­ers, one de­pen­dant’s pass holder and two short-term visit pass hold­ers.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean re­turned from Uzbek­istan while the per­ma­nent res­i­dent trav­elled from In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>An­other two im­ported cases are work per­mit hold­ers who re­turned from In­done­sia on Nov 9.</p>
    <p>The de­pen­dant’s pass holder is an In­dian na­tional who ar­rived from the United Arab Emi­rates. The re­main­ing im­ported cases are two short-term visit pass hold­ers who re­turned from the United States and United King­dom.</p>
    <p>They had all been placed on stay-home no­tices or iso­lated upon ar­rival here and were tested while serv­ing their no­tices.</p>
    <p>A mi­grant worker stay­ing in a dor­mi­tory was the re­main­ing coro­n­avirus pa­tient an­nounced yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,073.</p>
    <p>MOH said the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with a to­tal of two cases in the past week. Both cases are cur­rently un­linked.</p>
    <p>With four cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,970 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 40 pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 20 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
