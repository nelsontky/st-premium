    <p>Health work­ers in Qing­dao in east­ern China’s Shan­dong province tak­ing swabs from res­i­dents for Covid-19 tests yes­ter­day, af­ter the city re­ported a new clus­ter of 12 cases, snap­ping the coun­try’s streak of more than two months with­out a lo­cal trans­mis­sion case.</p>
    <p>Qing­dao said on Sun­day that it had un­cov­ered three asymp­to­matic cases linked to a hospi­tal that treats Covid-19 pa­tients com­ing from abroad. Ex­panded test­ing of hospi­tal pa­tients and staff found a fur­ther nine in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The lo­cal health com­mis­sion aims to test all nine mil­lion res­i­dents in the port city within five days.</p>

    <p>BEI­JING • China aims to test more than nine mil­lion res­i­dents of the port city of Qing­dao within five days fol­low­ing a mi­nor coro­n­avirus out­break, the first mass test­ing in months.</p>
    <p>The coun­try where the virus first emerged has largely con­trolled its out­break, cut­ting a stark con­trast to many parts of the world still af­flicted by rolling lock­downs and high case numbers.</p>
    <p>The new clus­ter snapped a streak of over two months with­out lo­cal trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>As of the end of Sun­day, main­land China has recorded 85,578 con­firmed cases and 4,634 deaths, ac­cord­ing to the Na­tional Health Com­mis­sion yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The city in Shan­dong province said on Sun­day that it found three asymp­to­matic cases linked to a hospi­tal which treats Covid-19 pa­tients com­ing from abroad. Ex­panded test­ing of hospi­tal pa­tients and staff then found nine more in­fec­tions – of the to­tal of 12 in the clus­ter so far, six are asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>Five dis­tricts will be tested “within three days” and the whole city “within five days”, the Qing­dao mu­nic­i­pal health com­mis­sion said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But of­fi­cials did not say ex­actly how many peo­ple would be tested.</p>
    <p>China has ex­ten­sive, quick test ca­pa­bil­i­ties and the health com­mis­sion said more than 140,000 em­ploy­ees of “med­i­cal in­sti­tu­tions, newly ad­mit­ted pa­tients and per­son­nel” have al­ready been tested in Qing­dao since the cases were con­firmed.</p>
    <p>“A sin­gle mo­ment of neg­li­gence may pro­vide a way in for the virus un­der the radar, and then it’ll cause sev­eral do­mes­tic cases,” said Dr Zhang Wen­hong, di­rec­tor of in­fec­tious dis­eases at Shang­hai Huashan Hospi­tal, who ad­vises the lo­cal gov­ern­ment on con­tain­ment strat­egy.</p>
    <p>“This is the risk we need to raise our re­sponse against.”</p>
    <p>In June, large ar­eas of the cap­i­tal Bei­jing were sub­ject to mass tests af­ter the city of more than 20 mil­lion de­tected virus cases linked to a food mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Still, the new Qing­dao clus­ter is un­likely to in­ter­rupt China’s progress in mov­ing past Covid-19 as its econ­omy re­bounds and life re­turns to nor­mal for the vast ma­jor­ity of cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>A na­tional eight-day hol­i­day pe­riod that just ended saw 637 mil­lion trips made do­mes­ti­cally, 80 per cent of the level from a year ago, re­flect­ing the coun­try’s con­fi­dence that mass travel with few re­stric­tions will not re­sult in un­con­trol­lable new flare­ups.</p>
    <p>The sources of these resur­gences re­main largely a mystery, as asymp­to­matic car­ri­ers pre­vent health ex­perts from be­ing able to map a chain of trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Last month, Qing­dao also found two port work­ers – re­spon­si­ble for un­load­ing frozen seafood – who tested pos­i­tive in rou­tine checks with­out show­ing symp­toms.</p>
    <p>China has sus­pended frozen food im­ports from plants in sev­eral coun­tries af­ter de­tect­ing the virus on the pack­ag­ing or sur­face of im­ported</p>
    <p>A sin­gle mo­ment of neg­li­gence may pro­vide a way in for the virus un­der the radar, and then it’ll cause sev­eral do­mes­tic cases... This is the risk we need to raise our re­sponse against.</p>
    <p>DR ZHANG WEN­HONG, di­rec­tor of in­fec­tious dis­eases at Shang­hai Huashan Hospi­tal, who ad­vises the lo­cal gov­ern­ment on con­tain­ment strat­egy. China’s strat­egy is mass test­ing and con­tact-trac­ing, and all who test pos­i­tive are iso­lated and quar­an­tined, re­gard­less of symp­toms.</p>
    <p>meat and seafood.</p>
    <p>Qing­dao of­fi­cials are now stick­ing to the same play­book China has used in curb­ing resur­gences af­ter it con­tained the ini­tial deadly out­break in Wuhan. Amid mass test­ing and con­tact-trac­ing, all who test pos­i­tive are iso­lated and quar­an­tined, re­gard­less of symp­toms.</p>
