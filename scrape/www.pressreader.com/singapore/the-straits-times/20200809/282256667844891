    <p>SIL­VER­STONE • Mercedes have been dom­i­nant the past six sea­sons in For­mula One, but Valt­teri Bot­tas still stated the ob­vi­ous af­ter clinch­ing pole po­si­tion for today’s 70th An­niver­sary Grand Prix ahead of cham­pi­onship-lead­ing team­mate Lewis Hamil­ton.</p>
    <p>“Proud to drive this amaz­ing car – it’s so quick,” said the Finn at Sil­ver­stone yesterday af­ter his 13th ca­reer pole fol­low­ing a stun­ning fi­nal lap. “The pace is good. It feels good.</p>
    <p>“Es­pe­cially when it goes well, it’s a good feel­ing.</p>
    <p>“Nice to get ev­ery­thing out of my­self and out of the car. Set-up wise we made good steps from last week­end, that’s why I think the qual­i­fy­ing per­for­mance was bet­ter than last week, re­ally pleased with that.”</p>
    <p>He clocked a fastest lap of 1min 25.154sec to beat Hamil­ton by only 0.063 in the fi­nal mo­ments of an en­thralling qual­i­fy­ing ses­sion.</p>
    <p>It was Mercedes’ 67th front-row lock­out, 48 hours af­ter Bot­tas signed a new con­tract to keep him at the Ger­man team next sea­son.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton ex­plained his un­ex­pected “slip”. “I wasn’t that great,” said the six-time world cham­pion.</p>
    <p>“But Valt­teri did a good job and de­served the pole I guess. For me, it wasn’t a per­fect last lap.”</p>
    <p>Nico Hulken­berg, re­plac­ing coro­n­avirus-suf­ferer Ser­gio Perez, took third for Rac­ing Point with an im­pres­sive per­for­mance only 10 days af­ter re­ceiv­ing a late call-up while eat­ing a pas­try in a Cologne cafe.</p>
    <p>His F1 re­turn last week­end was over be­fore it started when a tech­ni­cal prob­lem pre­vented him from start­ing the Bri­tish Grand Prix at the same Sil­ver­stone cir­cuit.</p>
    <p>“A crazy seven or eight days,” the Ger­man said. “Ob­vi­ously last week, with the big high to come back and the low on Sun­day (not start­ing the race), it was very ex­treme. This week­end I felt much bet­ter in the car, much more pre­pared.</p>
    <p>“Qual­i­fy­ing was still tricky and Q3 was just head down and a bit sur­prised to stand here (in third). But a big smile on my face and a lot of re­spect for the race to­mor­row.”</p>
    <p>Max Ver­stap­pen of Red Bull shared the sec­ond row, ahead of Daniel Ric­cia­rdo of Re­nault, Lance Stroll in the sec­ond Rac­ing Point, Pierre Gasly of Al­phaTauri and down in eighth Charles Le­clerc in the lead­ing Fer­rari.</p>
    <p>Alex Al­bon was ninth in the sec­ond Red Bull and Lando Nor­ris 10th for McLaren. Se­bas­tian Vet­tel did not make it to Q3 and qual­i­fied only 12th in the sec­ond Fer­rari.</p>
    <p>Off the track, five teams filed no­tice yesterday of their in­tent to ap­peal against the out­come of Rac­ing Point’s copy­ing scan­dal.</p>
    <p>The FIA stew­ards pub­lished their ver­dict on Fri­day, more than three weeks af­ter Re­nault’s ini­tial protest at its 2020 car, dubbed the “pink Mercedes” be­cause of its sim­i­lar­ity to the 2019 ti­tle-win­ning ve­hi­cle.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion fo­cused fi­nally on the le­gal­ity of Rac­ing Point’s brake ducts, which were ad­judged to be il­le­gal and con­trary to the sport­ing reg­u­la­tions of F1.</p>
    <p>Rac­ing Point were docked 15 points and fined €400,000 (S$647,140) but per­mit­ted to con­tinue us­ing the car.</p>
    <p>Teams were given 24 hours to give no­tice of in­ten­tion to ap­peal and yesterday Re­nault, Fer­rari,</p>
    <p>McLaren and Wil­liams joined Rac­ing Point in do­ing so, the key is­sue for the first four be­ing a be­lief the sanc­tions were too le­nient.</p>
    <p>Rac­ing Point be­lieve they have done noth­ing wrong and should have avoided a sanc­tion.</p>
