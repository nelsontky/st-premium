    <p>China will press on with its global high-tech am­bi­tions as Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping tasks its most in­no­va­tive city, Shen­zhen, to drive the cam­paign in the next phase of its devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>The mis­sion has gained ur­gency amid a world­wide eco­nomic slump and threats of de­cou­pling from the United States and other coun­tries, a chal­lenge that the Chi­nese leader ac­knowl­edged.</p>
    <p>In a 50-minute speech yes­ter­day to mark 40 years since Shen­zhen pi­o­neered a spe­cial eco­nomic zone that helped pro­pel its ex­po­nen­tial growth, Pres­i­dent Xi said China was at a key stage of trans­form­ing its econ­omy at a chal­leng­ing time.</p>
    <p>“The world to­day is un­der­go­ing ma­jor changes un­seen in a cen­tury... The eco­nomic, tech­no­log­i­cal, cul­tural, se­cu­rity, and po­lit­i­cal struc­tures are all un­der­go­ing pro­found ad­just­ments, and the world has en­tered a pe­riod of tur­bu­lent change,” he told more than 100 di­plo­mats, gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials and busi­ness lead­ers in Shen­zhen.</p>
    <p>Tech cap­i­tal Shen­zhen’s job is to con­tinue to re­form and open up, lead the way in in­no­va­tion and drive the Guang­dong-Hong KongMa­cau Greater Bay Area plan to turn the clus­ter into the coun­try’s eco­nomic pow­er­house.</p>
    <p>The blue­print calls for the in­te­gra­tion of nine cities in Guang­dong prov­ince, in­clud­ing Shen­zhen, Hong Kong and Ma­cau, to cre­ate a mega­lopo­lis with cross-bor­der busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>“It is nec­es­sary to con­tinue to en­cour­age and guide Hong Kong, Ma­cau, Taiwan com­pa­tri­ots and over­seas Chi­nese to the in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi’s speech comes just two weeks be­fore a cru­cial po­lit­i­cal meet­ing in Bei­jing where the Chi­nese lead­er­ship will un­veil the coun­try’s next five-year so­cial and eco­nomic plan, and an­other eco­nomic devel­op­ment blue­print that will guide it through to 2035.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese leader has been tour­ing the south­ern prov­ince of Guang­dong this week, urg­ing busi­nesses and work­ers to de­velop greater self-re­liance and in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>Since May, Pres­i­dent Xi and other of­fi­cials have bandied about the term, “dual cir­cu­la­tion”, a new eco­nomic strat­egy that is less de­pen­dent on for­eign markets and tech­nol­ogy and more on do­mes­tic con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Xi again al­luded to this pol­icy, say­ing that it is not a “closed do­mes­tic cir­cu­la­tion”, but “an open do­mes­tic and in­ter­na­tional dual cir­cu­la­tion”.</p>
    <p>That would re­quire not only im­prove­ments to the do­mes­tic sup­ply chain in­volv­ing pro­duc­tion, dis­tri­bu­tion and con­sump­tion, but also an open en­vi­ron­ment for for­eign in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, the gov­ern­ment an­nounced that it would give Shen­zhen greater au­ton­omy to carry out re­forms in its fi­nance sec­tor, tech­nol­ogy devel­op­ment and the hir­ing of for­eign talent.</p>
    <p>It also tasked Shen­zhen to be­come a “model city that can rep­re­sent a modernised and vi­brant so­cial­ist coun­try”.</p>
    <p>The south­ern me­trop­o­lis – a fish­ing vil­lage four decades ago – has seen its gross do­mes­tic prod­uct grow from 270 mil­lion yuan in 1980 to 2.7 tril­lion yuan (S$544 bil­lion) in 2019, said Pres­i­dent Xi, mak­ing it the fifth big­gest econ­omy among Asian cities.</p>
    <p>Hailed as China’s Sil­i­con Val­ley, it is home to some of the coun­try’s big­gest and most in­no­va­tive com­pa­nies, such as Ten­cent, Huawei, DJI and BYD as well as scores of tech start-ups.</p>
    <p>It is also the first city in China to have full-scale 5G cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>The blue­print calls for the in­te­gra­tion of nine cities in Guang­dong prov­ince, in­clud­ing Shen­zhen,</p>
    <p>Hong Kong and Ma­cau, to cre­ate a mega­lopo­lis with cross-bor­der busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
