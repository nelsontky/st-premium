    <p>ISLAMABAD • Pak­istan has ap­proved the chem­i­cal cas­tra­tion of rapists as part of sweep­ing new leg­is­la­tion sparked by out­cry over the gang rape of a mother on a mo­tor­way.</p>
    <p>New laws ap­proved by Pres­i­dent Arif Alvi on Tues­day will see rape cases ex­pe­dited through the courts and cre­ate the coun­try’s first na­tional sex of­fend­ers reg­is­ter.</p>
    <p>“The pro­vi­sion of the chem­i­cal cas­tra­tion of re­peat as well as first-time sex of­fend­ers... was added in the Anti-Rape Or­di­nance 2020,” the Pres­i­dent’s Of­fice con­firmed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Pak­istan is a deeply con­ser­va­tive and pa­tri­ar­chal na­tion, where vic­tims of sex­ual abuse of­ten are too afraid to speak out or where crim­i­nal com­plaints are fre­quently not in­ves­ti­gated se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, protests erupted af­ter a mother was raped on the side of the road in front of her chil­dren when her car broke down near La­hore.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Im­ran Khan re­sponded by call­ing for the chem­i­cal cas­tra­tion of rapists, which in­volves us­ing drugs to re­duce a per­son’s li­bido.</p>
    <p>Mr Khan had said the worst sex crimes should be pun­ish­able by pub­lic hang­ing, but added that this could im­pact trade with part­ners that op­pose the death penalty, such as the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>Rights ac­tivists have warned that the pro­vi­sion of chem­i­cal cas­tra­tion could af­fect Pak­istan’s in­ter­na­tional hu­man rights obli­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>“Chem­i­cal cas­tra­tions are cruel, in­hu­man and de­grad­ing and will leave the flawed crim­i­nal jus­tice in place,” said Ms Rim­mel Mo­hy­din, Pak­istan cam­paigner at Amnesty In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>Ms Nighat Dad, a women’s rights ac­tivist, praised the con­tent of the new leg­is­la­tion, but said it was un­clear how chem­i­cal cas­tra­tion would be ei­ther a “de­ter­rent or re­ha­bil­i­ta­tive”.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new laws, spe­cial courts will be es­tab­lished to try cases of rape and sex­ual abuse against women and chil­dren, which must be com­pleted within four months.</p>
    <p>They also es­tab­lish anti-rape cells across the coun­try for con­duct­ing ini­tial in­ves­ti­ga­tions and med­i­cal ex­am­i­na­tions within six hours of fil­ing a po­lice com­plaint, while abol­ish­ing an in­va­sive med­i­cal ex­am­i­na­tion known as the two-fin­ger vir­gin­ity test for rape vic­tims. The test in­volves a med­i­cal of­fi­cer in­sert­ing two fin­gers into a rape vic­tim’s vagina to as­sess her sex­ual his­tory.</p>
    <p>The laws come into ef­fect im­me­di­ately but must be rat­i­fied by Par­lia­ment within three months.</p>
    <p>It would come down to the dis­cre­tion of a trial judge to or­der chem­i­cal cas­tra­tion, said the Pres­i­dent’s Of­fice.</p>
