    <p>JAKARTA • Dr Tri Ma­ha­rani felt that she could cope with any dis­as­ter, be­cause she had at­tended to pa­tients in­jured in ev­ery­thing from tsunamis to vol­canic erup­tions for the past 22 years.</p>
    <p>But she was not pre­pared to be struck down by Covid-19 her­self.</p>
    <p>“In the first days, I was very dis­tressed. As a hu­man be­ing, I’m scared. I fear death,” the In­done­sian doc­tor told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“On the first, sec­ond and third days, I cried, and af­ter check-ups, my pneu­mo­nia wors­ened, af­fect­ing my lungs,” she said.</p>
    <p>But Dr Tri, In­done­sia’s only tox­i­nol­o­gist, and an ad­viser to the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion on snakebite man­age­ment, said she quickly got over her fears and was able to change her mind­set so she was “no longer sad, trou­bled and dis­ap­pointed”.</p>
    <p>She not only re­cov­ered from the dis­ease soon af­ter, but also went on to set up a Covid-19 sur­vivor group to fight the stigma that pa­tients and their fam­i­lies face.</p>
    <p>Test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19 on June 11, Dr Tri went into self-quar­an­tine for two days be­fore be­ing treated at Gam­bi­ran Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal in Kediri, East Java. She was in hos­pi­tal un­til July 23.</p>
    <p>While warded, she posted about her con­di­tion on Face­book, and friends re­sponded with sym­pa­thy and much-needed sup­port, send­ing her favourite food as well as masks and other items to her.</p>
    <p>She also wrote a let­ter to Health Min­is­ter Ter­awan Agus Pu­tranto, ask­ing for test kits to help in con­tact trac­ing for her staff and fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Soon af­ter re­turn­ing home, Dr Tri took it upon her­self to send care pack­ages to pa­tients across the vast ar­chi­pel­ago to lift their spir­its.</p>
    <p>In fact, in Jan­uary, be­fore the coun­try was gripped by the pan­demic, she was al­ready mak­ing haz­mat suits and masks with the help of her fam­ily and a friend, dis­tribut­ing them to mar­ket traders as well as health work­ers, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>She has also made and dis­trib­uted na­tion­wide more than 200 2m-long stetho­scopes, mod­i­fied with alu­minium pipes, which al­low doc­tors to main­tain a safe dis­tance from their pa­tients.</p>
    <p>An­other of her cre­ations is a box made from 5cm-thick acrylic that helps min­imise phys­i­cal con­tact when a doc­tor deals with a pa­tient.</p>
    <p>True to her pro­fes­sion, she had vol­un­teered to serve at a Covid-19 fa­cil­ity, the Su­lianti Saroso In­fec­tious Dis­eases Hos­pi­tal in Jakarta, from April 15 to 30.</p>
    <p>“When I re­flect on it now, I don’t re­gret my de­ci­sion (to care for oth­ers), be­cause it can in­spire many peo­ple and it makes me happy,” the 48-year-old said.</p>

She made more than 200 such stetho&#xAD;scopes &#x2013; mod&#xAD;i&#xAD;fied with alu&#xAD;minium pipes &#x2013; and dis&#xAD;trib&#xAD;uted them across In&#xAD;done&#xAD;sia.</p>
