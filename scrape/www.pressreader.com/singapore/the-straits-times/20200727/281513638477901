    <p>A man who caused se­vere brain in­juries to a fe­male pedes­trian when he col­lided with her while rid­ing an elec­tric scooter in 2016 has been or­dered to pay her dam­ages of $445,000.</p>
    <p>Madam Ang Liu Kiow, a 57-yearold mother of three, is still un­able to speak, read or write nearly four years af­ter the ac­ci­dent and needs help in daily ac­tiv­i­ties such as dress­ing, us­ing the toi­let and eat­ing.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors have as­sessed her men­tal dis­abil­i­ties to be per­ma­nent, ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments seen by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Last year, Madam Ang’s hus­band, Mr Leong Loon Wah, 57, sued es­cooter rider Ni­cholas Ting Nai Jie on her be­half, seek­ing dam­ages for the in­juries and losses she suf­fered as a re­sult of the ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Mr Ting, 21, had claimed in a court fil­ing that Madam Ang caused or con­trib­uted to the ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>He con­tended that she was neg­li­gent in “cre­at­ing a danger­ous sit­u­a­tion by dash­ing out” to­wards the path of his on­com­ing e-scooter and fail­ing to give him any rea­son­able op­por­tu­nity to avoid the col­li­sion.</p>
    <p>A State Courts judg­ment recorded by con­sent last month awarded dam­ages of $445,748.81 to Madam Ang. Mr Ting was also or­dered to pay le­gal costs of $25,000.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong and Madam Ang were rep­re­sented by Drew & Napier lawyer Bene­dict Teo, who acted on a pro bono ba­sis.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing through Mr Teo, Mr Leong told The Straits Times last Satur­day that Mr Ting has, through his lawyer, re­fused to pay the judg­ment sum.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court pro­ce­dure, pos­si­ble steps to en­force the judg­ment in­clude ques­tion­ing Mr Ting in court to de­ter­mine his as­sets or com­menc­ing bank­ruptcy pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>Mr Ting’s lawyer, Mr S. Sel­varaj, told ST that his client is a full-time na­tional ser­vice­man with no as­sets and is un­able to pay.</p>
    <p>On Sept 17, 2016, Mr Ting, then 18 and a polytech­nic stu­dent, had his</p>
