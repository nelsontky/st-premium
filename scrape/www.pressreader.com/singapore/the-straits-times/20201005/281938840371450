    <p>Now that Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, the De­part­ment of Justice is al­most cer­tainly fo­cus­ing on the 25th Amend­ment, which pro­vides for the trans­fer of pres­i­den­tial au­thor­ity to the vice-pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>No one who works for a sit­ting pres­i­dent wants to think about that amend­ment. But in any ad­min­is­tra­tion, worst-case sce­nar­ios get at­ten­tion, and if the pres­i­dent is sick, the lawyers and the vice-pres­i­dent have to be clear on what the 25th Amend­ment says and re­quires.</p>
    <p>The good news is that for most imag­in­able health out­comes associated with the virus, it is en­tirely clear. The less-good news is that for some imag­in­able health out­comes, es­pe­cially those associated with Covid-19, the 25th Amend­ment is am­bigu­ous.</p>
    <p>It of­fers two dif­fer­ent routes by which the trans­fer of power can oc­cur.</p>
    <p>Sec­tion 3 says this: “When­ever the Pres­i­dent trans­mits to the Pres­i­dent pro tem­pore of the Se­nate and the Speaker of the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives his writ­ten dec­la­ra­tion that he is un­able to dis­charge the pow­ers and du­ties of his of­fice, and un­til he trans­mits to them a writ­ten dec­la­ra­tion to the con­trary, such pow­ers and du­ties shall be dis­charged by the Vice-Pres­i­dent as Act­ing Pres­i­dent.”</p>
    <p>Sec­tion 4 says this: “When­ever the Vice-Pres­i­dent and a ma­jor­ity of ei­ther the prin­ci­pal of­fi­cers of the ex­ec­u­tive de­part­ments or of such other body as Congress may by law pro­vide, trans­mit to the Pres­i­dent pro tem­pore of the Se­nate and the Speaker of the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives their writ­ten dec­la­ra­tion that the Pres­i­dent is un­able to dis­charge the pow­ers and du­ties of his of­fice, the Vice-Pres­i­dent shall im­me­di­ately as­sume the pow­ers and du­ties of the of­fice as Act­ing Pres­i­dent.”</p>
    <p>Un­der Sec­tion 3, the pres­i­dent vol­un­tar­ily trans­fers power to the vice-pres­i­dent. Un­der Sec­tion 4, the de­ci­sion is made by the pres­i­dent’s own team – by ma­jor­ity vote. Sec­tion 4 also al­lows a role for Congress. If power has been trans­ferred to the vice-pres­i­dent, the pres­i­dent can pro­duce a writ­ten dec­la­ra­tion that he is well and can be­come pres­i­dent again – un­less the vice-pres­i­dent and a ma­jor­ity dis­agree.</p>
    <p>In the (un­likely) event of dis­agree­ment, Congress re­solves the is­sue, with the pres­i­dent pre­vail­ing un­less both Houses vote, by a two-thirds mar­gin, that he can­not dis­charge the pow­ers and du­ties of his of­fice.</p>
    <p>In 1981, I was a young lawyer in the Of­fice of Le­gal Coun­sel of the De­part­ment of Justice, and I saw the op­er­a­tion of these pro­vi­sions in real time. My boss Theodore Ol­son had asked me, very early in Mr Ron­ald Rea­gan’s pres­i­dency, to be­come the res­i­dent ex­pert on the 25th Amend­ment. I thought it was a hy­po­thet­i­cal ex­er­cise (and pretty point­less). But when John Hinck­ley shot Mr Rea­gan, Mr Ol­son qui­etly called me aside and told me that the pres­i­dent was in worse shape than the press was re­port­ing.</p>
    <p>He told me to write two dec­la­ra­tions trans­fer­ring power to then Vice-Pres­i­dent Ge­orge H. W. Bush. Both were sent to the White House. For­tu­nately, Mr Rea­gan re­cov­ered well, and no one needed to in­voke the 25th Amend­ment.</p>
    <p>For that rea­son, we didn’t need to fo­cus on a cru­cial un­re­solved ques­tion: the mean­ing of “un­able”, which is the amend­ment’s most im­por­tant word.</p>
    <p>As is now well known, peo­ple who test pos­i­tive for Covid-19 have a con­tin­uum of symp­toms. These can in­clude es­sen­tially noth­ing; mild flu-like sys­tems; se­ri­ous but not life-threat­en­ing un­pleas­ant­ness for a week or two; heart prob­lems; se­vere res­pi­ra­tory prob­lems need­ing hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion; and worse.</p>
    <p>That means that for 25th Amend­ment pur­poses, the De­part­ment of Justice’s analysis is mostly straight­for­ward. The amend­ment’s pur­pose is to han­dle just one prob­lem: in­ca­pac­i­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>If the pres­i­dent has mild flu-like symp­toms, or any­thing in that vicin­ity, the 25th Amend­ment should not and can­not be in­voked. If the pres­i­dent is es­sen­tially flat on his back and un­able to do his job (re­al­is­ti­cally speak­ing), the 25th Amend­ment must be in­voked. That is not dis­cre­tionary.</p>
    <p>If he is ca­pa­ble of do­ing so, he him­self must sign the dec­la­ra­tion re­quired by Sec­tion 3; if he can­not, the vice-pres­i­dent and the Cabi­net must pro­ceed un­der Sec­tion 4.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, we can also imag­ine hard cases. The course of Covid-19 is un­pre­dictable, and for some of its symp­toms, peo­ple can rea­son­ably dis­agree about whether it ren­ders its vic­tims “un­able” to do their jobs. Symp­toms that in­volve ex­treme fa­tigue, headaches and cog­ni­tion could present bor­der­line cases.</p>
    <p>It’s highly un­likely, but we can­not rule out a sit­u­a­tion in which the pres­i­dent re­fuses to sign a dec­la­ra­tion un­der Sec­tion 3 but in which the vice-pres­i­dent and the Cabi­net are com­pelled to pro­ceed un­der Sec­tion 4.</p>
    <p>For any­one who gets Covid-19, in­clud­ing the pres­i­dent, there is a good chance that the dis­ease will not prove in­ca­pac­i­tat­ing. If so, we will have no need to worry about the 25th Amend­ment. But it’s es­sen­tial to un­der­stand what it makes clear, and what it leaves open.</p>
