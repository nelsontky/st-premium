    <p>He was jailed two years ago for gang-re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties, but Adam (not his real name) has turned over a new leaf and is now study­ing hard be­hind bars.</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old is de­ter­mined to suc­ceed. While in prison, he has com­pleted a di­ploma in in­ter­na­tional sup­ply chain man­age­ment, and is cur­rently pur­su­ing a bach­e­lor’s de­gree in lo­gis­tics and sup­ply chain man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>This is un­der a self-study pro­gramme launched in July by the prison school and the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences.</p>
    <p>Adam is one of 80 in­mates who re­ceived a gold award at the Na­tional Youth Achieve­ment Award (NYAA) cer­e­mony on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The awards were given out at In­sti­tu­tion Tanah Merah 1, for­merly known as Tanah Merah Prison. Today, it houses the prison school.</p>
    <p>Those who had been re­leased prior to the cer­e­mony or were un­able to at­tend will re­ceive their awards on a sep­a­rate oc­ca­sion.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 131 in­mates com­pleted the NYAA pro­gramme this year and were awarded gold, sil­ver or bronze – the three lev­els in the pro­gramme. This is more than in pre­vi­ous years due to the widen­ing of the age range for pro­gramme par­tic­i­pants – from 16 to 25, to 16 to 30 – this year.</p>
    <p>More than 2,000 in­mates have par­tic­i­pated in the NYAA pro­gramme since its in­tro­duc­tion in prison in 2000.</p>
    <p>It aims to help in­mates de­velop self-re­liance, per­se­ver­ance and a sense of re­spon­si­bil­ity to them­selves and the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob said at the awards cer­e­mony that the NYAA pro­gramme is use­ful for devel­op­ing per­sonal qual­i­ties and skills.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing the re­cip­i­ents, she said: “To Adam and each one of you who em­barked on your NYAA jour­ney, you can be proud of your­selves for mak­ing this ef­fort to change.</p>
    <p>“You have em­braced the theme of this year’s pro­gramme by dar­ing to ex­plore, lead­ing our dream, striv­ing to suc­ceed and bet­ter­ing our so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>She added: “I hope that the val­ues and ex­pe­ri­ence gained from the NYAA pro­gramme will guide you through the rest of your life, even out­side these prison walls, as oth­ers be­fore you have done.”</p>
    <p>One such suc­cess story is Mr Dar­ren Tan, 42, a for­mer of­fender who spent close to 11 years in prison for var­i­ous of­fences in­clud­ing drug con­sump­tion and traf­fick­ing.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing his time in jail, he re­ceived the NYAA bronze and sil­ver awards in 2003 and 2004 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Af­ter his re­lease, he pur­sued his dream of be­ing a lawyer, and is now head of civil prac­tice and di­rec­tor at In­vic­tus Law Cor­po­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>He has also given back to the com­mu­nity by work­ing with non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion Tasek Jurong and Bea­con of Life Academy, an outreach ini­tia­tive for at-risk youth.</p>
    <p>For his work and ser­vice to the com­mu­nity, Mr Tan was awarded the first Hon­orary NYAA Gold Award on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said he still car­ries today the val­ues he learnt un­der the NYAA while he was in prison.</p>
    <p>“I ben­e­fited more from the NYAA than I gave to it,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The truth is, many a time (when giv­ing back), we also learn com­pas­sion, em­pa­thy and form­ing mean­ing­ful con­nec­tions with fel­low hu­man be­ings.”</p>
    <p>The NYAA ex­pe­ri­ence has al­lowed Adam to pick up new skills and valu­able ex­pe­ri­ences. One in­stance was when a group of in­mates hosted se­nior ci­ti­zens from the com­mu­nity for lunch and put up a mu­sic per­for­mance for them.</p>
    <p>“I feel that do­ing these ac­tiv­i­ties, where I can give back to so­ci­ety, is very mean­ing­ful,” said Adam.</p>
    <p>While he ad­mit­ted he can­not turn back time and undo his past, Adam said “the best thing to do is to make good use of my time from now on”.</p>
    <p>He is grate­ful for his fam­ily’s sup­port. His par­ents have not missed any of the per­mit­ted twice-amonth vis­its. The of­fi­cers and per­sonal su­per­vi­sors in prison have also been un­fail­ingly sup­port­ive.</p>
    <p>Adam added: “Some­one is al­ways mo­ti­vat­ing me along the path that changes me for the bet­ter. And I’m very grate­ful for that.”</p>
