    <p>NEW YORK • For­mer world No. 1 Andy Mur­ray claimed the big­gest win of his come­back and a place in the last 16 of the Western and South­ern Open by tak­ing out fifth seed Alexan­der Zverev 6-3, 3-6, 7-5.</p>
    <p>Mur­ray of­fered hope he was on the right track af­ter his in­jury woes with a tidy first-round win over Frances Ti­afoe on Saturday. But it was Monday’s win that will pro­vide a con­fi­dence boost in the run-up to the US Open that starts in the same quar­an­tine bub­ble in New York next Monday.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther player will in­clude the con­test in their ca­reer high­light reels, par­tic­u­larly a scrappy third set that was rid­dled with un­forced er­rors and mo­men­tum swings.</p>
    <p>But Mur­ray, play­ing in only his sec­ond ATP Tour match of the year, closed out the con­test with back-to-back win­ners, plant­ing a fore­hand down the line be­fore hit­ting a ser­vice re­turn into the cor­ner.</p>
    <p>“It was a big one to get through,” the world No. 134 said af­ter his first top-10 vic­tory since he beat Ja­pan’s Kei Nishikori at Roland Gar­ros in 2017. “I’m sat­is­fied to get through it against a top player hav­ing not played for such a long time and I get an­other op­por­tu­nity to com­pete again to­mor­row. This will give me an idea of where my body is at.”</p>
    <p>Zverev served for the match at 5-4 but dou­ble-faulted three times to hand Mur­ray a break.</p>
    <p>“It’s pretty good,” Zverev said of Mur­ray’s level of play. “I was very sur­prised at how well he’s mov­ing.”</p>
    <p>Next up for the Scot is Cana­dian Mi­los Raonic, who ad­vanced with a 6-3, 7-5 vic­tory over Dan Evans.</p>
    <p>Filip Kra­ji­novic stunned sec­ond seed Do­minic Thiem 6-2, 6-1 and will meet Mar­ton Fucso­vics, who beat Grigor Dimitrov 7-5, 4-6, 6-2.</p>
    <p>In the women’s draw, Ser­ena Wil­liams es­caped an up­set, bat­tling back from the brink to beat Dutch qual­i­fier Aran­txa Rus 7-6 (8-6), 3-6, 7-6 (7-0) to book a third round clash against Maria Sakkari of Greece.</p>
    <p>“That was tough. It was a real phys­i­cal match out there,” she said of the spec­ta­tor-free en­counter that lasted two hours and 49 min­utes. “I’m ac­tu­ally su­per fit and I’m su­per ready.”</p>
    <p>While Wil­liams is gear­ing up to win a 24th Grand Slam ti­tle at the US Open, for­mer French Open cham­pion Je­lena Ostapenko will not get the chance to add to her tally.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old, who won her only Slam in 2017 at Roland Gar­ros but has slipped to No. 42 in the world rank­ings, has with­drawn from the US Open due to a change in her sched­ule.</p>
