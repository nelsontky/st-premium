    <p>A vir­tual event of­fer­ing ca­reer work­shops and a guide to re­sources for skills train­ing will be ex­tended till next month, fol­low­ing a run last week that at­tracted more than 257,000 par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>Among the high­lights are work­shops to help res­i­dents bet­ter un­der­stand the job mar­ket and skill trends amid the pan­demic, and live chats with ex­perts in var­i­ous in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>Skill­sFu­ture@CDC 2020 – The Fu­ture of You is or­gan­ised by all five com­mu­nity de­vel­op­ment coun­cils (CDCs).</p>
    <p>In a joint state­ment with Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore and the Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute yes­ter­day, the CDCs said the ex­ten­sion is in re­sponse to Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat’s min­is­te­rial state­ment on Mon­day, in which he in­tro­duced a slew of mea­sures to sup­port job seek­ers.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy con­tracted 13.2 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter – its worst quar­terly con­trac­tion. Work­ers across sec­tors have lost their jobs or taken pay cuts.</p>
    <p>The pump­ing of $8 bil­lion more into Covid-19 sup­port mea­sures an­nounced on Mon­day comes on top of the nearly $100 bil­lion com­mit­ted un­der the four Bud­gets this year.</p>
    <p>The Jobs Sup­port Scheme of wage sub­si­dies to help com­pa­nies re­tain lo­cal work­ers will cover wages paid up to March next year.</p>
    <p>“There is a lot of de­mand and in­ter­est in skills train­ing, and the CDCs are re­spond­ing to this de­mand,” the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>At­ten­dance at the vir­tual event from Aug 10 to 16 saw a more than sev­en­fold in­crease from the 31,240 par­tic­i­pants at phys­i­cal venues last year. More than 6,300 peo­ple at­tended the 50 vir­tual work­shops last week, com­pared with 2,060 at phys­i­cal ones last year.</p>
    <p>Ms Low Yen Ling, Mayor of South West Dis­trict and chair­man of the May­ors’ Com­mit­tee, said: “The CDCs will con­tinue to spare no ef­fort in bring­ing job op­por­tu­ni­ties and skills train­ing to res­i­dents, es­pe­cially those... dis­placed by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“By go­ing dig­i­tal, the fair now reaches res­i­dents wher­ever they are, and places in their hands the abil­ity to up­skill them­selves any time.”</p>
    <p>The Skill­sFu­ture Ad­vice vir­tual work­shops are from noon to 1pm on Sept 10 and 24. The live chats with in­dus­try ex­perts will be from 7.30pm to 9pm on both days.</p>
