    <p>When he was in pri­mary school, Mr Mal­com Lau loved food but he would of­ten skip meals dur­ing re­cess to save his pocket money.</p>
    <p>The rea­son was that he wanted to help his sin­gle mother who strug­gled to put food on the table for him and his younger sis­ter.</p>
    <p>Things changed in 2007 when he was in Pri­mary 4. He started re­ceiv­ing a $35 monthly al­lowance from The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund (STSPMF).</p>
    <p>The money not only al­lowed him to have a meal at re­cess, but also helped de­velop his self-con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>Those days of go­ing hun­gry in school from Pri­mary 1 to Pri­mary 3 are still fresh in the mind of Mr Lau, now 23 and a Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) un­der­grad­u­ate.</p>
    <p>He said: “The ex­tra pocket money al­lowed me to min­gle with my friends and de­velop my so­cial skills with­out wor­ry­ing about whether I could af­ford to go out with them.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese skills are im­por­tant be­cause they pre­pare a child for in­ter­per­sonal re­la­tions at the work­place in the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lau is among the 180,000 ben­e­fi­cia­ries of the STSPMF, which was launched on Chil­dren’s Day in 2000. To­day marks the fund’s 20th an­niver­sary.</p>
    <p>Mr Lau said that when he was in polytech­nic, the fund again came to his aid be­tween 2014 and 2015.</p>
    <p>His sis­ter, now a 20-year-old polytech­nic stu­dent, was also a ben­e­fi­ciary of the fund.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily was also sup­ported by the Thye Hua Kwan Fam­ily Ser­vice Cen­tre in Be­dok North.</p>
    <p>Mr Lau, who is pur­su­ing a de­gree in chem­i­cal engi­neer­ing on an NUS schol­ar­ship, said he ap­pre­ci­ates the as­sis­tance he re­ceived and plans to give back to the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“When I first joined the course, I was mo­ti­vated by the po­ten­tial to earn well. But now, I be­lieve what mat­ters more is what we do with the money that we earn. I want to uplift other kids who could be in the sit­u­a­tion I was in,” he said.</p>
    <p>For an­other ben­e­fi­ciary of the STSPMF, the pocket money has given her the op­por­tu­nity to ex­plore her creative side.</p>
    <p>Adele Soong, eight, a Pri­mary 2 pupil at St Mar­garet’s Pri­mary School, spent $40 from the money she re­ceived to buy an elec­tronic key­board. With the help of an app and YouTube videos, she has taught her­self how to play it.</p>
    <p>STSPMF ben­e­fi­cia­ries in pri­mary school re­ceive $60 a month.</p>
    <p>Her mother, Ms Tif­fany Tee, 45, an ad­min­is­tra­tive as­sis­tant, said: “When Adele wants to buy food or sta­tionery, like a wa­ter­colour paint set, I can tap the fund to buy it for her in­stead of putting it off to the next month or her birth­day.”</p>
    <p>Ms Tee and her hus­band also have two sons – a four-year-old and a nine-year-old who is autis­tic.</p>
    <p>The three chil­dren re­ceive aid from the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry’s Fi­nan­cial As­sis­tance Scheme, which helps needy fam­i­lies meet school ex­penses.</p>
    <p>Ms Tee said the money Adele re­ceives from the STSPMF is a wel­come relief. On a typ­i­cal school day, Adele and her best friend would tuck into their favourite food at re­cess: roti prata.</p>
    <p>Though she en­joys paint­ing and as­pires to be an artist, she is sav­ing up to buy a set of drums as she wants to learn new in­stru­ments on her own.</p>
    <p>For 14-year-old Dahlia Dlaila Iskan­dar, the STSPMF has en­cour­aged her to as­pire to be a nurse.</p>
    <p>The Sec­ondary 2 stu­dent at CHIJ Ka­tong Con­vent and her two sib­lings, aged six and 16, faced fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties at home while grow­ing up. Her par­ents had to set aside money for bills and basic needs, which took pri­or­ity over other pur­chases.</p>
    <p>Dahlia has been a ben­e­fi­ciary of the fund since 2013. She re­ceived an al­lowance for 19 months while in pri­mary school and for five months this year, from Jan­uary to May.</p>
    <p>She said: “The fund en­cour­ages me to work harder in school so that I can achieve my dream to be a nurse and help other peo­ple. I’m thank­ful for the con­tri­bu­tions made by donors.”</p>
