    <p>Five Sin­ga­pore­ans and one Malaysian are on the short­list for the sixth Epi­gram Books Fic­tion Prize, which will be pre­sented in a vir­tual cer­e­mony on Jan 16.</p>
    <p>Among them are Se­bas­tian Sim, 54, who won the $25,000 prize in 2017 for his satir­i­cal novel The Riot Act; and Daryl Qilin Yam, 29, whose de­but Kappa Quar­tet was longlisted for the 2015 prize.</p>
    <p>New­com­ers to the award, Sin­ga­pore’s only prize for un­pub­lished English-lan­guage nov­els, in­clude Lasalle Col­lege of the Arts lec­turer Wes­ley Leon Aroozoo, 36; As­so­ci­a­tion of Comic Artists of Sin­ga­pore vice-pres­i­dent Boey Mei­han, 43; and lawyer Pallavi Gopinath Aney, 40.</p>
    <p>Aroozoo, a film-maker, has pub­lished books such as the 2017 non­fic­tion novella I Want To Go Home, about a Ja­panese man who dives to search for the wife he lost in a tsunami. Boey re­leased her de­but novel, space opera The Mes­siah Virus, last year.</p>
    <p>The sole Malaysian on the list is H.Y. Yeang, 70, a re­tiree who pre­vi­ously headed the Biotech­nol­ogy and Strate­gic Re­search Unit at Malaysia’s Rub­ber Re­search In­sti­tute. He has au­thored and coau­thored over 200 re­search pa­pers.</p>
    <p>As the usual ho­tel gala cer­e­mony had to be can­celled due to Covid-19, Epi­gram redi­rected the sav­ings to­wards ex­pand­ing the prize short­list from four to six nov­els, in­creas­ing the pot from $40,000 to $50,000. In pre­vi­ous years, the prize was awarded to four nov­els, with one win­ner re­ceiv­ing $25,000 and three fi­nal­ists each get­ting $5,000.</p>
    <p>The panel of judges in­cludes Epi­gram Books founder Ed­mund Wee; film pro­ducer and cu­ra­tor Wahyuni Hadi; chil­dren’s book au­thor Mon­ica Lim; Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of English Sim Wai Chew; and Mr Gareth Richards, founder of Ger­ak­bu­daya Book­shop in Pe­nang.</p>
