    <p>The or­gan­is­ers of the Grammy Awards launched an ini­tia­tive on Thurs­day to el­e­vate black voices at all lev­els of the mu­sic industry and en­sure that black artists are fairly com­pen­sated for their work.</p>
    <p>The #ChangeMu­sic Roadmap, launched by the Record­ing Academy and racial jus­tice non­profit or­gan­i­sa­tion Color of Change, said black con­tri­bu­tions to the mu­sic industry have his­tor­i­cally been un­der­val­ued.</p>
    <p>Black artists “have cre­ated styles of mu­sic, the cul­ture, the trends and the suc­cess of this busi­ness – yet too of­ten are left un­her­alded and ex­cluded from the rooms in which the most im­por­tant de­ci­sions are made”, the or­gan­is­ers said.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive fol­lows a cul­tural reck­on­ing spurred by street protests across the United States this sum­mer over sys­temic racism, as well as pres­sure on the mu­sic busi­ness to in­crease the num­ber of black peo­ple in its cor­po­rate ranks.</p>
    <p>Rap and R&B mu­sic over­took rock in 2017 to be­come the big­gest mu­sic genre in the US, but there are only a hand­ful of black ex­ec­u­tives in se­nior jobs across the industry.</p>
    <p>The Record­ing Academy, which votes on the Gram­mys, has come un­der fire in re­cent years from black artists such as Drake, Jay-Z and Kanye West for seem­ingly favour­ing white artists.</p>
    <p>In more than 60 years of the Gram­mys, only t wo hip-hop al­bums have ever won the Al­bum of the Year prize.</p>
    <p>The last black artist to win the cov­eted ac­co­lade was Her­bie Han­cock in 2008.</p>
    <p>The Record­ing Academy in Oc­to­ber launched the Black Mu­sic Col­lec­tive i n re­sponse to the crit­i­cism.</p>
    <p>The #ChangeMu­sic Roadmap calls for the fair distri­bu­tion of roy­al­ties, an ex­am­i­na­tion of old record­ing con­tracts for po­ten­tial in­equities, anti-racist train­ing, an­nual re­ports on pay dis­par­i­ties and an in­crease in the num­ber of black peo­ple in lead­er­ship po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>“This mo­ment of­fers an un­par­al­leled op­por­tu­nity to change pat­terns of ex­clu­sion and degra­da­tion,” the Record­ing Academy and Color of Change said in a state­ment.</p>
