    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump an­nounced US$13 bil­lion (S$17.6 bil­lion) in new aid for farm­ers at a cam­paign rally on Thurs­day night in Wis­con­sin, a crit­i­cal elec­toral bat­tle­ground where he has been trail­ing in re­cent polls.</p>
    <p>The United States Congress had au­tho­rised ad­di­tional bor­row­ing au­thor­ity for the Depart­ment of Agri­cul­ture in Covid-19 re­lief leg­is­la­tion passed ear­lier this year, and the sec­ond round has been widely an­tic­i­pated.</p>
    <p>“I am do­ing even more to sup­port Wis­con­sin farm­ers,” Mr Trump said dur­ing the rally. “Start­ing next week, my ad­min­is­tra­tion is com­mit­ting an ad­di­tional – you have been ask­ing for this for a long time – US$13 bil­lion in re­lief to help farm­ers re­cover from the China virus, in­clud­ing Wis­con­sin’s in­cred­i­ble dairy, cran­berry and gin­seng farm­ers who got hurt badly.”</p>
    <p>Un­veil­ing bil­lions of dol­lars in new agri­cul­tural pay­ments at the rally in Mosinee, in cen­tral Wis­con­sin, might help Mr Trump gain max­i­mum credit for the assistance in a cru­cial state for the 2020 elec­tion where ru­ral vot­ers play a ma­jor role.</p>
    <p>Nine opin­ion polls taken since Aug 29 all show Demo­crat Joe Bi­den lead­ing in Wis­con­sin.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump car­ried the state by just 0.8 per­cent­age point four years ago on the strength of over­whelm­ing sup­port from ru­ral res­i­dents, who backed him by 62 per cent to 35 per cent and ac­counted for more than a quar­ter of votes cast, ac­cord­ing to exit polls.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump did not de­tail the new assistance. Peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said the Agri­cul­ture Depart­ment would ex­plain how the aid is to be dis­trib­uted.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Farm­ers Union pres­i­dent Rob Larew said in a state­ment:</p>
    <p>“This sup­port is ab­so­lutely cru­cial – but it is just as cru­cial that it is dis­trib­uted fairly and eq­ui­tably.”</p>
    <p>The US leader un­veiled the first round of as much as US$19 bil­lion in coro­n­avirus aid in April, af­ter the au­tho­ri­sa­tion from Congress. That in­cluded as much as US$16 bil­lion in di­rect pay­ments to farm­ers to bol­ster their in­comes, and US$3 bil­lion for gov­ern­ment pur­chases of meat, dairy prod­ucts and other foods.</p>
    <p>“The first round of fund­ing, though greatly ap­pre­ci­ated, was not with­out its flaws,” Mr Larew said. “Not only did it favour large farms over smaller ones, it also sent mil­lions of dol­lars to for­eignowned op­er­a­tions and ex­cluded some farm­ers en­tirely.”</p>
