    <p>The pro­mo­tional pho­tos and videos for Or­chard Ho­tel’s suite-andy­acht stay­ca­tion show young adults sip­ping bub­bly, liv­ing the care­free, In­sta­gram-wor­thy luxe life on a yacht.</p>
    <p>Not the usual ho­tel stay, for sure. But I won­dered if all this opu­lence would be lost on two fraz­zled par­ents with a pair of bouncy, al­ways-on-the-move daugh­ters, aged seven and a lit­tle un­der two.</p>
    <p>My doubts were un­founded. There was plenty to sa­ti­ate both par­ents and kids, from a yacht trip and an is­land jaunt to water sports and cus­tomised culi­nary ex­pe­ri­ences. We even had a but­ler, Ray­mond, at our beck and call.</p>
    <p>Af­ter we checked in, Ray­mond and his col­leagues took us to our room – the ho­tel’s art­fully dec­o­rated 1,130 sq ft Premier Suite.</p>
    <p>I was ex­cited to dis­cover that it has two bath­rooms, a boon when one kid is hog­ging the bath­tub while the other needs to go ur­gently.</p>
    <p>The sofa bed in the liv­ing room had al­ready been pre­pared, as was a cot for the tod­dler, placed be­side the king-size bed in the bed­room.</p>
    <p>Af­ter pris­ing the kids away from their rit­ual of jump­ing on ho­tel beds, we nipped out for lunch at the nearby Fo­rum The Shop­ping Mall.</p>
    <p>We con­sid­ered a post-lunch stroll, but our but­ler had promised the kids there would be gi­ant floats at the ho­tel pool, so we zipped back for a swim.</p>
    <p>An af­ter­noon tea set was wait­ing for us when we got back to our room af­ter the swim, a spread that in­cluded slid­ers, scones and cakes. We weren’t hungry, but who could say no to post-swim bites?</p>
    <p>Din­ner was even more im­pres­sive – a four-course set by the swim­ming pool.</p>
    <p>The cool evening breeze and fairy lights at the area made for a ro­man­tic vibe, though the kids were more im­pressed by the gi­ant chess pieces be­side the pool.</p>
    <p>It was an early start the next day. Af­ter a scrump­tious break­fast at 7am at The Or­chard Cafe, we were chauf­feured, with our but­ler, to One15 Ma­rina Sen­tosa Cove to board a 16.5m-long yacht, the Le­viathan 88.</p>
    <p>We were greeted warmly by boat owner Daniel and his helms­man, also named Ray­mond. I felt as­sured to know that both of them were for­merly from the navy, and their knowl­edge of the seas and is­lands around Sin­ga­pore was im­pec­ca­ble.</p>
    <p>The yacht had two comfy cab­ins, which came in handy dur­ing baby nap-time; a mini kitchen; and a bath­room.</p>
    <p>To our tod­dler’s de­light and ev­ery­one else’s hor­ror, there was also a karaoke ma­chine on board that had Baby Shark on its playlist.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a sail around the South­ern Is­lands, we docked at Lazarus Is­land and spent some time at the beach – eas­ily the best you can find in Sin­ga­pore, with its crys­tal-clear wa­ters, fine white sand and a much smaller crowd than you would get at East Coast or on Sen­tosa.</p>
    <p>We went back to the boat, which an­chored off the Lazarus coast, for a spot of water play.</p>
    <p>Daniel was more than happy to let us try out all the toys that his yacht held, in­clud­ing a three-man kayak and a gi­ant float­ing water mat on which you can lounge and have a drink. He also showed me a photo of a jet ski he had just or­dered.</p>
    <p>At around noon, our but­ler pre­pared, on board the yacht, a seafood pic­nic spread that in­cluded lob­ster, tuna sand­wiches as well as choco­late eclairs and fruit.</p>
    <p>Alas, af­ter a scenic ride along the wa­ters of the Sin­ga­pore Strait with views of the CBD sky­line, it was time to dis­em­bark and head back to the ho­tel.</p>
    <p>We had plenty of time to laze around, freshen up and pack our lug­gage as check-out time was 6pm</p>
    <p>– a lux­ury that any­one, par­ent or not, can cer­tainly ap­pre­ci­ate.</p>
    <p>HOT TIPS</p>
    <p>If you are prone to sea­sick­ness, it is best to take anti-nau­sea pills as a pre­cau­tion be­fore you board the yacht.</p>
    <p>Those who do not have to worry about cater­ing to the needs of their chil­dren can con­sider the Yacht-cation pack­age by an­other ho­tel run by Mil­len­nium Ho­tels and Re­sorts, M So­cial, which comes with adult-ori­ented ac­tiv­i­ties such as a cock­tail-cre­ation work­shop.</p>
