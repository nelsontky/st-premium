    <p>1st Pol­ish woman to reach the fi­nal at Roland Gar­ros.</p>
    <p>PARIS • In six matches at this French Open, no one has come close to find­ing a so­lu­tion to Iga Swiatek.</p>
    <p>Not the No. 1 seed and for­mer cham­pion Si­mona Halep, whom the Pol­ish teenager crushed 6-1, 6-2 in the fourth round. Not Ar­gen­tinian qual­i­fier Na­dia Podor­oska, whom she routed 6-2, 6-1 in a lit­tle more than an hour yes­ter­day in the semi-fi­nals at Roland Gar­ros.</p>
    <p>Swiatek is just 19 with a sur­name that many peo­ple are still learning to pro­nounce (try Shvee-ON-tek).</p>
    <p>She is play­ing in only her sev­enth Grand Slam tour­na­ment and has yet to win a tour ti­tle, but she has leapt into the tennis strato­sphere in a hurry.</p>
    <p>“Ba­si­cally I wanted to play this match as if it would be a first round,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause I didn’t want to think I was in a semi-fi­nal be­cause it would stress me, so I just kept be­ing ag­gres­sive like in the pre­vi­ous matches.”</p>
    <p>No one has won more than four games in a set against her in Paris this year, and al­though she is un­seeded and in­ex­pe­ri­enced, ranked just 54th, it will be hard not to con­sider her the favourite when she takes to the court to­mor­row for her first Grand Slam sin­gles fi­nal against No. 4 seed Sofia Kenin.</p>
    <p>This is de­spite the 21-year-old Amer­i­can, who beat sev­enth seed and two-time Wim­ble­don win­ner Pe­tra Kvi­tova 6-4, 7-5 in the later semi-fi­nal, hav­ing al­ready won this year’s Aus­tralian Open.</p>
    <p>But nei­ther of the Grand Slam cham­pi­ons has con­sis­tently hit the same sorts of high notes in the past two weeks as Swiatek, whose com­pact blend of of­fence and de­fence has been ir­re­sistible.</p>
    <p>“I’m kind of sur­prised re­ally,” said the Pole, who has lost only 23 games in her six matches so far.</p>
    <p>“I would have never thought at this tour­na­ment I would play so good here, but on the other hand, I al­ways knew if I was go­ing to be in the fi­nal of a Grand Slam it would be the French Open. So I’m re­ally happy. It’s a dream come true.”</p>
    <p>Swiatek, who fin­ished high school ear­lier this year, is now the youngest player to reach the women’s fi­nal at Roland Gar­ros since Kim Cli­jsters did it as an 18-year-old in 2001.</p>
    <p>She has matched the run of com­pa­triot Jad­wiga Je­drze­jowska, who fin­ished run­ner-up at Roland Gar­ros in 1939.</p>
    <p>She is also only the sec­ond Pol­ish woman to reach a Grand Slam fi­nal in the Open era af­ter Ag­nieszka Rad­wan­ska at Wim­ble­don in 2012.</p>
    <p>On top of that, she be­comes the sev­enth un­seeded women’s fi­nal­ist at the French Open. Of the pre­vi­ous six, only Je­lena Ostapenko in 2017 went on to lift the tro­phy.</p>
    <p>For now, though, Swiatek is only en­joy­ing the moment be­fore the fi­nal to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>She said: “Sofia is on fire this year. Re­ally, I don’t want to think about it right now. I’m just glad I’m in the fi­nal. It’s over­whelm­ing for me.”</p>
    <p>For her part, Podor­oska, the first women’s qual­i­fier to reach the last four here, will rise to a ca­reer-best rank­ing of 48th af­ter the event, hav­ing ar­rived with­out a sin­gle Grand Slam main draw win.</p>
