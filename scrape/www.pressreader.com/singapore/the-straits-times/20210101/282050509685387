    <p>MOV­ING FOR­WARD</p>
    <p>A new pro­gramme will al­low the court to ap­point third-party fi­nan­cial ex­perts to give ob­jec­tive opin­ions of the val­u­a­tion of as­sets to be divided in a con­tentious di­vorce.</p>
    <p>The pi­lot pro­gramme will be­gin in the first quar­ter of this year, and the Fam­ily Jus­tice Courts (FJC) will work with fi­nan­cial ex­perts on val­u­a­tion re­ports of a hand­ful of cases on a pro bono ba­sis.</p>
    <p>In line with the fam­ily jus­tice sys­tem’s adoption of “ther­a­peu­tic jus­tice” as its over­ar­ch­ing phi­los­o­phy, where the law helps di­vorc­ing par­ties to re­pair their re­la­tion­ships to a func­tional level, the project will al­low ex­perts to as­sist par­ties “em­broiled in com­pli­cated and con­tentious fi­nan­cial dis­putes”, FJC and the In­sti­tute of Sin­ga­pore Char­tered Accountant­s (Isca) said in a joint state­ment on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, par­ties sep­a­rately en­gage their own val­uers and present their val­u­a­tion re­ports to the court. The court has to then eval­u­ate each of these re­ports and de­ter­mine the val­u­a­tion to be used for the divi­sion of mat­ri­mo­nial as­sets.</p>
    <p>The process is time-con­sum­ing and costly as the judge has to re­solve these pre­lim­i­nary fi­nan­cial is­sues. It may also cre­ate fur­ther an­i­mos­ity be­tween par­ties, said an FJC spokesman, in re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“(The new pro­gramme) al­lows the judge to fo­cus on his or her main task of ad­ju­di­ca­tion, and avoids dis­putes as to the ap­point­ment of the fi­nan­cial ex­pert, thereby al­low­ing jus­tice to be ad­min­is­tered more ef­fec­tively and ef­fi­ciently,” said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>FJC and Isca will review and later de­cide if the ini­tia­tive should be im­ple­mented on a long-term ba­sis. Should the pi­lot be a suc­cess, FJC will work with the fi­nan­cial ex­perts to iron out the struc­ture of the pro­gramme, in­clud­ing the fees for the ex­perts and the cri­te­ria for a case to be re­ferred to the panel of ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Lawyers who spoke to The Straits Times agreed that the move could help to stream­line the val­u­a­tion process of as­sets.</p>
    <p>Fam­ily lawyer Belinda Ang, who has more than 40 years of ex­pe­ri­ence, noted that the new pro­gramme could be fairer as both par­ties will have ac­cess to a fi­nan­cial ex­pert, who may oth­er­wise be costly. “They don’t have to out­bid each other to find a neu­tral fi­nan­cial ex­pert,” she said.</p>
    <p>Part­ner and co-head of Harry Elias Part­ner­ship’s fam­ily and di­vorce and pri­vate client ad­vi­sory , Mr Koh Tien Hua, cau­tioned that the se­lected ex­perts from the panel must be neu­tral and not have any per­sonal or pro­fes­sional con­flicts of in­ter­est with the par­ties.</p>
    <p>The panel of fi­nan­cial ex­perts is made up of Isca mem­bers with ex­pe­ri­ence in pro­vid­ing ad­vice on the divi­sion of mat­ri­mo­nial as­sets, dis­pute res­o­lu­tion or as ex­pert wit­nesses in court cases. There are cur­rently six mem­bers.</p>
    <p>They are Mr Ravi Aru­mugam, chief ex­ec­u­tive and man­ag­ing part­ner of RT LLP; Mr Kon Yin Tong, man­ag­ing part­ner of Foo Kon Tan LLP; Mr Lee Dah Khang, di­rec­tor of Yang Lee Con­sult­ing; Mr Michael Peer, part­ner at PwC Sin­ga­pore; Mr Wayne Soo, man­ag­ing part­ner of Fidu­cia LLP and Mr Tan Wei Cheong, part­ner at Deloitte Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>On the sign­ing of the mem­o­ran­dum of un­der­stand­ing be­tween FJC and Isca, Jus­tice Deb­bie Ong, the FJC’s pre­sid­ing judge, said: “The as­sis­tance of the fi­nan­cial ex­perts is in line with our adoption of ther­a­peu­tic jus­tice in di­vorce pro­ceed­ings, en­sur­ing that the divi­sion of mat­ri­mo­nial as­sets can be con­ducted in a non-ad­ver­sar­ial man­ner, with the as­sur­ance that both par­ties can find a sus­tain­able way for­ward fi­nan­cially af­ter they part ways.”</p>
