    <p>For nearly five years, a boy was sex­u­ally abused by his un­cle, who started touch­ing the vic­tim in­ap­pro­pri­ately when he was about five or six years old, and then pro­gressed to more heinous acts.</p>
    <p>The of­fences were re­vealed years later, when the boy, by then in sec­ondary school, was caught tak­ing an up­skirt video and sent for coun­selling.</p>
    <p>At the ses­sion, the boy broke down and told the school coun­sel­lor he had been abused since he was in Kin­der­garten 2. The coun­sel­lor alerted the school’s man­age­ment, and a po­lice report was made.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the per­pe­tra­tor, a 54-year-old for­mer tech­ni­cian, was sen­tenced to 22 years’ jail af­ter he pleaded guilty to one count each of ag­gra­vated sex­ual as­sault by penetratio­n and at­tempted ag­gra­vated sex­ual as­sault by penetratio­n.</p>
    <p>Seven other charges – five counts of out­rage of mod­esty against a per­son un­der 14 and two counts of ag­gra­vated sex­ual as­sault by penetratio­n – were con­sid­ered in sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>The man can­not be named ow­ing to a gag or­der to pro­tect the iden­tity of the vic­tim, who is now 16.</p>
    <p>The High Court heard that the vic­tim’s par­ents had di­vorced around the time he was born, and he was taken care of by his ma­ter­nal grand­mother.</p>
    <p>The boy lived in the same four­room Hous­ing Board flat as the ac­cused, who is mar­ried to the boy’s ma­ter­nal aunt. The other oc­cu­pants were the ac­cused’s son and the vic­tim’s ma­ter­nal un­cle.</p>
    <p>The court heard that the boy called the ac­cused “Baba”, a way of ad­dress­ing a fa­ther in Malay, and treated the man as a fa­ther.</p>
    <p>The man be­gan sex­u­ally ex­ploit­ing the vic­tim in 2010, when he touched the boy over his shorts when they were alone in the kitchen.</p>
    <p>The pre-schooler, think­ing that his un­cle was be­ing play­ful, laughed it off.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the first in­ci­dent, the man would touch the boy fre­quently when they were alone.</p>
    <p>Over the years, the man be­came em­bold­ened when the boy did not re­act ad­versely to the touch­ing, and he moved on to rub­bing him­self against the vic­tim.</p>
    <p>Some time be­tween 2013 and 2014, the man told the boy to fol­low him to the toi­let and made him per­form oral sex on him. On an­other oc­ca­sion, he tried to sodomise the boy.</p>
    <p>The boy re­alised the ac­tions were wrong only af­ter at­tend­ing sex ed­u­ca­tion classes in 2017, but did not re­veal the of­fences un­til he was caught tak­ing the up­skirt video in Au­gust 2018.</p>
    <p>A psy­chi­atric report said the vic­tim felt some anger to­wards the man for abus­ing him but also felt guilt to­wards the man’s son for re­port­ing the abuse.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Gre­gory Gan said the man had ex­ploited his nephew’s naivete and trust by com­mit­ting pro­gres­sively se­vere sex­ual acts on him.</p>
    <p>The fre­quency of the acts led to the vic­tim’s ex­po­sure to sex­ual ac­tiv­ity at an ex­tremely early age, the pros­e­cu­tor said.</p>
