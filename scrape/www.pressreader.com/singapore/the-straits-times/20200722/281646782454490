    <p>MOSCOW • Scores of Rus­sia’s busi­ness and po­lit­i­cal elites have been given early ac­cess to an ex­per­i­men­tal Covid-19 vac­cine, ac­cord­ing to people fa­mil­iar with the ef­fort, as the country races to be among the first to de­velop an in­oc­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Top ex­ec­u­tives at firms in­clud­ing alu­minium giant United Co Rusal, as well as bil­lion­aire ty­coons and govern­ment of­fi­cials be­gan get­ting shots de­vel­oped by the state-run Ga­ma­leya In­sti­tute as early as April, the sources said. They asked not to be iden­ti­fied as the in­for­ma­tion is not pub­lic.</p>
    <p>The Ga­ma­leya vac­cine, fi­nanced by the state-run Rus­sian Di­rect In­vest­ment Fund (RDIF) and backed by the De­fence Min­istry, last week com­pleted a Phase I trial in­volv­ing mil­i­tary per­son­nel. The in­sti­tute has not pub­lished re­sults for the study, which in­volved about 40 people, but has be­gun the next stage of test­ing with a larger group.</p>
    <p>Asked if Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin had taken it, Krem­lin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “It prob­a­bly wouldn’t be a good idea to use an un­cer­ti­fied vac­cine on the head of state.” He added that he was not aware of other of­fi­cials try­ing it.</p>
    <p>Mr Peskov’s com­ments fol­lowed a Health Min­istry state­ment that said only par­tic­i­pants in Ga­ma­leya’s tri­als were el­i­gi­ble.</p>
    <p>While the new shots are “safe” as they are based on proven vac­cines for other diseases, their ef­fec­tive­ness has yet to be de­ter­mined, said</p>
    <p>Mr Sergei Netesov, a former ex­ec­u­tive at the state-run virol­ogy cen­tre Vec­tor, which is also work­ing on an in­oc­u­la­tion. “Those who take it do so at their own risk,” he added.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia has re­ported more than 780,000 coro­n­avirus cases, the fourth-largest case tally in the world, and Ga­ma­leya’s pro­gramme is on a faster track than many de­vel­op­ers in the West.</p>
    <p>RDIF chief Kir­ill Dmitriev last week said Phase III tri­als would start on Aug 3 and in­clude thou­sands of people in Rus­sia, Saudi Ara­bia and the United Arab Emi­rates, with the vac­cine dis­trib­uted na­tion­ally as early as Septem­ber. Western re­searchers typ­i­cally run Phase III tri­als for months to better un­der­stand safety and ef­fec­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>Ga­ma­leya’s can­di­date is a so­called vi­ral vec­tor vac­cine based on hu­man ade­n­ovirus – a com­mon cold virus – fused with the spike pro­tein of Sars-CoV-2 to stim­u­late an im­mune re­sponse. It is sim­i­lar to a vac­cine be­ing de­vel­oped by China’s CanSino Bi­o­log­ics, which is al­ready in Phase II tri­als.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme un­der which well-con­nected Rus­sians have been given the chance to vol­un­teer for doses of the ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cine is le­gal but kept un­der wraps to avoid a crush of po­ten­tial par­tic­i­pants, ac­cord­ing to a re­searcher fa­mil­iar with the ef­fort.</p>
    <p>He said sev­eral hun­dred people have been in­volved. Bloomberg con­firmed dozens who have had the shots but none would al­low their names to be pub­lished. It is not clear how par­tic­i­pants are se­lected and they are not part of the of­fi­cial stud­ies, though they are mon­i­tored and their re­sults logged.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients usu­ally get the shots – two are needed to pro­duce an im­mune re­sponse that Ga­ma­leya says will last for about two years. Par­tic­i­pants are not charged a fee and sign state­ments con­firm­ing they know the risks in­volved.</p>
    <p>RDIF’s Mr Dmitriev said he and his family had taken the shots and noted that a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of other vol­un­teers were also given the op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>The Ga­ma­leya In­sti­tute said it had vac­ci­nated its di­rec­tor and the team work­ing on the trial.</p>
    <p>In May, state-con­trolled Sber­bank re­cruited vol­un­teers among em­ploy­ees to take the jabs.</p>
    <p>One se­nior ex­ec­u­tive who was in­oc­u­lated said he ex­pe­ri­enced no side ef­fects, adding that the health risks were worth be­ing able to re­sume nor­mal life. Other tak­ers re­ported ex­pe­ri­enc­ing fevers and mus­cle aches af­ter the shots.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral man­agers in the Moscow of­fices of Rusal, which re­lies on Ga­ma­leya’s Ebola vac­cine to main­tain op­er­a­tions in Guinea, have al­ready taken its Covid-19 shots, people fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said.</p>
    <p>Ga­ma­leya chief Alexan­der Ginzbur said he was not aware of any govern­ment of­fi­cials or busi­ness lead­ers tak­ing his in­sti­tute’s vac­cine, ac­cord­ing to In­ter­fax.</p>
