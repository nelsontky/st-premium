    <p>A sec­ond main­board-listed com­pany has backed Dr Goh Jin Hian’s con­tin­ued role on its board de­spite a law­suit brought against him over an al­leged breach of di­rec­tor’s du­ties at an­other firm.</p>
    <p>New Silkroutes Group said yes­ter­day that it re­gards Dr Goh – the com­pany’s non-in­de­pen­dent non-ex­ec­u­tive chair­man – as suit­able to con­tinue as di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>The nom­i­nat­ing com­mit­tee and the board noted that “the ac­tion is a civil suit against Dr Goh and, based on le­gal ad­vice of his lawyers, the al­le­ga­tions are with­out merit”.</p>
    <p>The health­care and en­ergy firm cited a Straits Times report yes­ter­day of a law­suit brought by the ju­di­cial man­agers of in­sol­vent marine fuel sup­plier In­ter-Pa­cific Petroleum (IPP) against Dr Goh over his al­leged breach of di­rec­tor’s du­ties.</p>
    <p>Dr Goh, who is the son of for­mer prime min­is­ter Goh Chok Tong, was a di­rec­tor of IPP from June 2011 to Au­gust last year. The com­pany was placed un­der ju­di­cial man­age­ment in Septem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>The suit, filed late last Fri­day night in Sin­ga­pore’s High Court, seeks to re­cover about US$156 mil­lion (S$212 mil­lion) with in­ter­est from Dr Goh for draw­downs of trade fi­nanc­ing be­tween June and July last year to fund al­leged “nonex­is­tent or sham trans­ac­tions”.</p>
    <p>New Silkroutes said in a fil­ing to the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX): “The board un­der­stands that Dr Goh’s lawyers, TSMP Law Corp, have ex­changed cor­re­spon­dence with the ju­di­cial man­agers and de­tailed, with clear ex­pla­na­tion, why there is no jus­ti­fi­able case against him.</p>
    <p>“Dr Goh has been ad­vised by his lawyers that the ju­di­cial man­agers’ al­le­ga­tions are with­out merit both on the facts and on the law.</p>
    <p>“The board un­der­stands that Dr Goh has ev­ery con­fi­dence that he will be wholly vin­di­cated when he de­fends him­self in court.”</p>
    <p>The firm’s nom­i­nat­ing com­mit­tee and board, with Dr Goh ab­stain­ing, re­it­er­ated that his “char­ac­ter and in­tegrity re­main suit­able to con­tinue as a di­rec­tor of the com­pany”.</p>
    <p>They added that they be­lieve it is in the in­ter­est of the com­pany and its share­hold­ers that he re­mains as non-ex­ec­u­tive chair­man.</p>
    <p>Dr Goh stepped down as New Silkroutes chief ex­ec­u­tive last Thurs­day but re­tained the chair­man’s role he took on in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>He is as­sist­ing the Com­mer­cial Af­fairs De­part­ment over a pos­si­ble of­fence un­der the Securities and Fu­tures Act in­volv­ing New Silkroutes. His pass­port has been re­tained.</p>
    <p>In a late Mon­day night fil­ing to the SGX, Cordlife Group also re­it­er­ated its sup­port for Dr Goh as in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tor while an­nounc­ing that he had stepped down as chair­man fol­low­ing news of the law­suit.</p>
    <p>The firm said its nom­i­nat­ing com­mit­tee and board – again with Dr Goh ab­stain­ing – be­lieve that he “has the char­ac­ter and in­tegrity suit­able to con­tinue as in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tor” and that it is in the best in­ter­ests of the com­pany that he does so “given his qual­i­fi­ca­tions, ex­per­tise and ex­pe­ri­ence”.</p>
    <p>Cordlife added that “the ces­sa­tion of Dr Goh’s role as chair­man will al­low (him) to con­tinue en­sur­ing that suf­fi­cient time and at­ten­tion are given to the af­fairs of the com­pany as an in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tor”.</p>
    <p>New Silkroutes called for a trad­ing halt yes­ter­day morn­ing but lifted it at 1.45pm. Its shares closed up 0.2 cent, or 1.8 per cent, at 11.3 cents.</p>
    <p>Cordlife shares last traded at 36 cents on Sept 30.</p>
