    <p>iQiyi</p>
    <p>This drama looks at what de­fines a fam­ily and has at its heart an un­con­ven­tional fam­ily brought to­gether by love as much as cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>Wi­d­ower Li Haichao is very much a dream dad if not quite a dream boat. He is kept busy run­ning a neigh­bour­hood noo­dle shop, but never fails to pre­pare three meals for his young daugh­ter Jian­jian.</p>
    <p>When the cou­ple up­stairs – po­lice­man Ling Heping and wife Chen Ting – keep hav­ing fights, Li in­vites their trou­bled son Ling Xiao home for meals. Wrecked by guilt over the death of her daugh­ter, Chen later walks out on the mar­riage and leaves be­hind her son.</p>
    <p>Another boy, He Ziqiu, ends up liv­ing with Li af­ter his sin­gle mother He Mei – whom Li is in­tro­duced to by a match­maker – leaves the boy in his care.</p>
    <p>The early episodes of this drama are suf­fused with charm – ac­tor Tu Songyan ( left, cen­tre) ra­di­ates warmth as Li, who loves cook­ing and tak­ing care of chil­dren. The young ac­tors play­ing the chil­dren are nat­u­rals, es­pe­cially the two boys who man­age to con­vey their char­ac­ters’ feel­ings of hurt.</p>
    <p>The show’s writ­ing is a cut above the rest, with its poignant ob­ser­va­tion, for ex­am­ple, on how peo­ple drift apart and are left with lit­tle to say to each other – and this awk­ward­ness is of­ten am­pli­fied by in­stant mes­sag­ing tools.</p>
