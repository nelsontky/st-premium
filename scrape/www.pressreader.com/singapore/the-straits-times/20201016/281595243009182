    <p>Wild Rice will be re­open­ing its Ngee Ann Kongsi Theatre at</p>
    <p>Fu­nan mall on Nov 4 after a clo­sure of nearly eight months.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal theatre com­pany Wild Rice will be re­open­ing the doors of its Ngee Ann Kongsi Theatre at Fu­nan mall on Nov 4, after a clo­sure of nearly eight months.</p>
    <p>It re­turns with one-woman show An Ac­tress Pre­pares, star­ring Siti Khal­i­jah Zainal, from Nov 4 to 22. Writ­ten by Al­fian Sa’at and di­rected by Aidli “Alin” Mos­bit, the play fol­lows Siti’s jour­ney through theatre.</p>
    <p>Pri­or­ity book­ing for Wild Rice An­gels, the com­pany’s donors, be­gan yes­ter­day while pub­lic sales will open on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Seat­ing will be lim­ited to 50 peo­ple for each show due to Covid-19 safety re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>The show will pro­ceed de­pend­ing on safety ad­vi­sories for the re­sump­tion of live per­for­mances next month. Wild Rice will of­fer new per­for­mance dates or full re­funds to pa­trons if this re­sump­tion is fur­ther de­layed.</p>
    <p>Wild Rice found­ing artis­tic direc­tor Ivan Heng said he felt “ner­vous, ex­cited and full of an­tic­i­pa­tion” about re­open­ing the theatre.</p>
    <p>“Al­though it’s not sus­tain­able and we’re not go­ing to break even, this is a very im­por­tant step in tak­ing au­di­ences on a jour­ney to come back to the theatre.”</p>
    <p>He added that An Ac­tress Pre­pares, which had orig­i­nally been in­tended to open the theatre’s in­au­gu­ral sea­son last year, was a “po­etic and slightly ironic choice” for this oc­ca­sion.</p>
    <p>He said: “The play is about what it means to ded­i­cate your life to act­ing, the theatre and play­ing be­fore a live au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>“Al­fian, Alin, Siti and the com­pany are re­work­ing it to think about what it means now. We’ve gone through a very tough pe­riod, when ac­tors have not been per­form­ing.</p>
    <p>“How does an ac­tor pre­pare for each role and for a life in the theatre? What does this mean in these tu­mul­tuous times, when jobs are scarce and the fu­ture is so un­cer­tain? It will be a spe­cial show.”</p>
    <p>Wild Rice fol­lows Sin­ga­pore Reper­tory Theatre, which will be re­open­ing its venue, the KC Arts Cen­tre – Home of SRT, next month with Tues­days With Mor­rie, star­ring Ramesh Pan­icker and Ben­jamin Chow. The show pre­views on Nov 1 and pre­mieres on Nov 4.</p>
    <p>Wild Rice and SRT joined forces with fel­low theatre com­pany Pangde­mo­nium for The Pitch, a short film re­leased in Au­gust to raise funds and aware­ness about the tribu­la­tions of theatre com­pa­nies dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Since Sept 11, the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil (NAC) has been con­duct­ing small-scale pi­lot tri­als to pre­pare for the re­open­ing of per­for­mance venues. The Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth and NAC will re­view the re­sults of these tri­als after this month.</p>
