    <p>There is in­creas­ing dan­ger of vi­o­lent ex­trem­ism spread­ing as global com­mu­ni­ties strug­gle to curb the spread of Covid-19, a Mus­lim re­li­gious teacher and ter­ror­ism ex­pert in­volved in re­ha­bil­i­tat­ing rad­i­cals in Sin­ga­pore said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has raised the chances of peo­ple be­ing rad­i­calised be­cause many are now spend­ing more time on­line as they work or learn from home and in­ter­act with oth­ers via so­cial me­dia, said the vice-chair­man of the Re­li­gious Re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion Group (RRG), Dr Mo­hamed Ali. He noted that this dan­ger is es­pe­cially pro­nounced among the young, who spend more time on the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>“With the pro­lif­er­ated use of on­line com­mu­ni­ca­tions to ad­here to strict so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, youth are spend­ing even more time on­line, es­pe­cially on so­cial me­dia. In the same beat, Covid-19 has changed how ter­ror­ist or­gan­i­sa­tions, se­cu­rity agen­cies and so­ci­ety op­er­ate glob­ally.”</p>
    <p>He said that ter­ror groups will take ad­van­tage of this to spread their ideas. Dr Mo­hamed was speak­ing at a vir­tual event that the RRG or­gan­ised for stu­dents from in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The event, held via video-con­fer­enc­ing plat­form Zoom and streamed live via Face­book and In­sta­gram, was at­tended by about 740 peo­ple. It fea­tured di­a­logues and talks by Is­lamic re­li­gious teach­ers and the Deputy Mufti of Sin­ga­pore, Dr Mo­ham­mad Han­nan Has­san.</p>
    <p>Launched in 2003, the RRG is a non-profit group that trains re­li­gious teach­ers to coun­sel those in­flu­enced or mis­guided by rad­i­cal teach­ings.</p>
    <p>Since 2002, more than 130 in­di­vid­u­als found to have been in­volved in ter­ror­ism-re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties have been dealt with here.</p>
    <p>But Covid-19 has raised new chal­lenges in the fight against ter­ror­ism and vi­o­lent ex­trem­ism. In Au­gust, the United Na­tions’ un­der­sec­re­tary-gen­eral for its counter-ter­ror­ism of­fice, Dr Vladimir Voronkov, said the global pan­demic “raises sev­eral strate­gic and prac­ti­cal chal­lenges for counter-ter­ror­ism”.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, ter­ror groups like the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria are launch­ing more “op­por­tunis­tic pro­pa­ganda ef­forts”, fu­elling an on­go­ing trend of at­tacks by in­di­vid­u­als and small groups, he said.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing yes­ter­day’s event, Dr Mo­hamed called on youth and par­tic­i­pants in RRG’s Aware­ness Pro­gramme for Youths (APY) to rally to­gether to spread pos­i­tive mes­sages to the Mus­lim com­mu­nity and to re­ject vi­o­lent ex­trem­ism.</p>
    <p>He said: “The spread of rad­i­cal nar­ra­tives on­line makes youths more vul­ner­a­ble to on­line rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion. In this re­gard, the work of the RRG and the APY in reach­ing out to youths… is ex­tremely im­por­tant.”</p>
