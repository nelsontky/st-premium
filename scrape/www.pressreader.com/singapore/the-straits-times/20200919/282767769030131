    <p>A prom­i­nent fea­ture in the block­buster hit Crazy Rich Asians, the Con­vent of the Holy In­fant Je­sus (CHIJ) build­ing knows an il­lus­tri­ous his­tory be­fit­ting its sil­ver screen sta­tus. The ivor y ram­part once used to serve as an or­phan­age, tak ing in ba­bies that were deemed to carry traces of bad luck. These hap­less in­fants would usu­ally come in the form of chi­nese baby girls born in the year of the tiger – a su­per­sti­tion that stuck at that time.</p>
    <p>But not all hope was lost for them, as here, the or­phans would then go</p>
    <p>on to re­ceive free ed­u­ca­tion in the schools within the com­pound, learn­ing do­mes­tic and vo­ca­tional skills. The side gate where the ba­bies were fropped off earned the tag</p>
    <p>"Gate of Hope", which has been pre­served and can still be seen to this day.</p>
    <p>To­day, a large num­ber of shops rag­ing from din­ing to life­style fll</p>
    <p>the iconic cor­ri­dors. The bars that op­er­ate deep into the night have also come to be known as a hotspot for sports fa­nat­ics look­ing for some high-oc­tane ca­ma­raderie.</p>
