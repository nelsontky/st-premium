    <p>Six Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces (SAF) ser­vice­men who had been charged in mil­i­tary court over the 2018 death of full-time na­tional ser­vice­man (NSF) Dave Lee have been sen­tenced, said the Min­istry of De­fence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The six ser­vice­men – two reg­u­lars and four op­er­a­tionally ready na­tional ser­vice­men (NS­men) – who were charged in Fe­bru­ary and pleaded guilty, were fined be­tween $1,800 and $4,500.</p>
    <p>Three of them were also de­moted from the rank of third sergeant (NS) to cor­po­ral.</p>
    <p>Cor­po­ral First Class (CFC) Dave Lee, who was 19 years old at the time and a guards­man from the 1st Bat­tal­ion Sin­ga­pore Guards, died on April 30, 2018, about two weeks af­ter he was ad­mit­ted to Changi Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal for heat­stroke.</p>
    <p>The case had sparked dis­cus­sion on train­ing safety and lapses in the SAF af­ter De­fence Min­is­ter Ng Eng Hen de­tailed in Par­lia­ment in Au­gust 2018 the pre­lim­i­nary find­ings over the cir­cum­stances sur­round­ing the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>The mil­i­tary court pro­ceed­ings came af­ter Cap­tain Tan Baoshu – the su­per­vis­ing of­fi­cer in the 8km fast march af­ter which the in­ci­dent oc­curred – was given a dis­charge not amount­ing to an ac­quit­tal in Jan­uary this year, af­ter he was di­ag­nosed with Stage 4 can­cer.</p>
    <p>He had claimed trial af­ter he was charged in the State Courts on Oct 31, 2018.</p>
    <p>The At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers had de­ter­mined that af­ter the con­clu­sion of po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions, there were suf­fi­cient grounds to pros­e­cute Tan un­der crim­i­nal law, said the Min­istry of De­fence.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Min­def said First Sergeant Chia Zhi Xuan, 25, was con­victed of one charge of dis­obe­di­ence of gen­eral or­ders un­der Sec­tion 21 of the SAF Act and fined $2,500.</p>
    <p>The reg­u­lar ser­vice­man was the con­duct­ing of­fi­cer for a train­ing run held a day be­fore the fast march in which CFC Lee par­tic­i­pated, and he had made unau­tho­rised de­vi­a­tions from the run’s les­son plan.</p>
    <p>An­other reg­u­lar, Sec­ond Sergeant Koh Ren Zhong, 26, who was the safety of­fi­cer for the fast march, was con­victed of one charge of neg­li­gent per­for­mance of a law­ful duty un­der Sec­tion 17(2) of the SAF Act and fined $1,800. He had orig­i­nally faced one charge of com­mit­ting a neg­li­gent act en­dan­ger­ing life un­der Sec­tion 41(b) of the SAF Act.</p>
    <p>Three NS­men sec­tion com­man­ders who meted out unau­tho­rised pun­ish­ment the day be­fore the fast march were each fined $2,500 and de­moted from third sergeant to cor­po­ral. They are Cor­po­ral (NS) Chng Pheng Heng, 22; Cor­po­ral (NS) Jonas Ang Kai Jie, 24; and Cor­po­ral (NS) Yep Ren Jie, 22.</p>
    <p>They were each con­victed of one charge of dis­obe­di­ence of gen­eral or­ders un­der Sec­tion 21 of the SAF Act and one charge of abuse of authority un­der Sec­tion 29 of the Act.</p>
    <p>Ini­tially, they had each faced three charges – two charges of dis­obe­di­ence of gen­eral or­ders and one charge of abuse of authority.</p>
    <p>Cor­po­ral (NS) Tan Jin Yang, 24, also an NS­man and the medic for the fast march, was con­victed of two charges of neg­li­gent acts en­dan­ger­ing life un­der Sec­tion 41(b) of the SAF Act. He was fined a to­tal of $4,500 for both charges.</p>
    <p>The po­lice had re­ferred the six ser­vice­men to Min­def to in­ves­ti­gate po­ten­tial breaches of mil­i­tary law. The ser­vice­men were charged in mil­i­tary court af­ter the SAF’s Spe­cial In­ves­ti­ga­tion Branch con­cluded its in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Tan Baoshu, 33, died on Feb 13 this year fol­low­ing his can­cer di­ag­no­sis. He had been charged with caus­ing the death of CFC Lee by per­form­ing a rash act, in­clud­ing fail­ing to evac­u­ate the vic­tim in a timely man­ner, and ac­cused of dis­al­low­ing the treat­ment that CFC Lee needed.</p>
    <p>Dr Ng said in Au­gust 2018 that a pre­lim­i­nary as­sess­ment found the likely rea­sons for CFC Lee suc­cumb­ing to heat­stroke to be in­ad­e­quate on-site ca­su­alty man­age­ment and de­layed evac­u­a­tion to the med­i­cal cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter had also said that CFC Lee and his pla­toon mates were pun­ished for about 30 min­utes the night be­fore the fast march be­cause two sol­diers had used their mo­bile phones af­ter lights out.</p>
    <p>The pun­ish­ment for per­ceived lack of team­work in­volved the en­tire pla­toon. The sol­diers were made to do phys­i­cal ex­er­cises such as leop­ard crawls, push-ups and crunches.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier that day, CFC Lee also did an in­ter­val train­ing run at a faster pace than he was re­quired to, with a shorter rest time be­tween laps.</p>
    <p>This was a breach of train­ing safety reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Dr Ng said then that the rea­son given for these de­vi­a­tions was that the com­man­ders wanted to en­hance fit­ness and fos­ter greater co­he­sion by keep­ing the pla­toon in­tact.</p>
