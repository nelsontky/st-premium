    <p>Where fash­ion brand Love, Bonito once dressed women for their first jobs, it is now look­ing to clothe them as they pre­pare for their first child.</p>
    <p>In the mid­dle of l ast month, the l ocal l abel re­launched its ma­ter­nity line, called Em­brace, which it started two years ago. The line was de­signed to fill a gap in the ma­ter­nity wear mar­ket here, with stylish pieces that can take women from preg­nancy to nurs­ing, says co-founder Rachel Lim, 33.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary last year, the brand also launched its first chil­dren’s cloth­ing line.</p>
    <p>Jour­ney­ing with the cus­tomer through her var­i­ous life stages has al­ways been Love, Bonito’s mis­sion, says Ms Lim. “We knew we wanted to be there for her work, life, home and play mo­ments.”</p>
    <p>The fash­ion re­tail brand is not alone in em­brac­ing this con­cept of grow­ing with its cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Sports­wear gi­ant Nike, too, launched its first ma­ter­nity col­lec­tion last month, with ac­tivewear es­sen­tials like a nurs­ing sports bra cater­ing to preg­nant women and new moth­ers.</p>
    <p>Mil­len­ni­als, de­fined by the Pew Re­search Cen­tre in the United States as any­one born be­tween 1981 and 1996, have been no­to­ri­ously hard to woo as shoppers.</p>
    <p>A 2018 Forbes ar­ti­cle said that brand loy­alty is low for this age group, who re­spond bet­ter when brands make an ef­fort to be rel­e­vant to them.</p>
    <p>As these mil­len­ni­als be­come par­ents, brands are piv­ot­ing their prod­ucts while still ap­peal­ing to their tastes and pref­er­ences.</p>
    <p>Other than ma­ter­nity wear, the other ob­vi­ous of­fer­ing is chil­dren’s cloth­ing.</p>
    <p>Many in­ter­na­tional brands such as Gap, Zara and Mango al­ready had their own line for kids for many years. De­signer brands that have made sim­i­lar for­ays in re­cent years in­clude Gucci, Burberry and Stella Mc­Cart­ney, while re­gional e-tailer Zalora launched a ded­i­cated kids cat­e­gory on its web­site and app last year.</p>
    <p>Now, the smaller play­ers are also branch­ing out into chil­dren’s wear.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal fash­ion la­bel Our Sec­ond Na­ture launched a kids col­lec­tion called Our Mini Na­ture in 2018 – with pieces in its sig­na­ture whim­si­cal prints, so mum and her lit­tle one can twin in match­ing out­fits.</p>
    <p>Menswear brand Dux­ton, owned by par­ents of two tod­dlers, started a kids’ line in March last year.</p>
    <p>Beauty brands are also mak­ing prod­ucts for the tots. French brand Chante­caille re­leased a baby range of sk­in­care prod­ucts in 2016, af­ter cre­ative di­rec­tor Olivia Chante­caille, who had her first daugh­ter in 2014, could not find chil­dren’s prod­ucts on a par with her own.</p>
    <p>The Bebe line ($71 to $92) – com­pris­ing a face cream, body lo­tion, balm, and hair and body wash – is touted as one of the world’s purest botan­i­cal kids sk­in­care ranges.</p>
    <p>In April 2018, fel­low lux­ury beauty brand Dr Bar­bara Sturm added a Mini Molec­u­lar line of baby-safe prod­ucts, in­clud­ing a bathing milk and nappy cream, priced from US$39 to US$64 (S$53 to S$87).</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, sk­in­care l abel Hand­made He­roes launched its first prod­ucts for mother and baby last year.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times spot­lights three lo­cal brands which have ex­panded into mother and chil­dren’s prod­ucts.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Mrs Iris Ramos and her hus&#xAD;band, Dustin, who run menswear brand Dux&#xAD;ton in Dux&#xAD;ton Road, di&#xAD;ver&#xAD;si&#xAD;fied into Dux&#xAD;ton Kids in March last year af&#xAD;ter they found it hard to find ca&#xAD;sual wear for their daugh&#xAD;ters, Matilda, three, and Macken&#xAD;zie, one, that was func&#xAD;tional for the play&#xAD;ground but still &#x201C;fun and cool&#x201D;.</p>
