    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • A key pros­e­cu­tion wit­ness in the cor­rup­tion trial of Ros­mah Man­sor re­vealed yes­ter­day how Malaysia’s for­mer ed­u­ca­tion min­is­ter Mahdzir Khalid, and an­other per­son who was the Umno sec­re­tary for Na­jib Razak’s con­stituency, had de­manded up to RM60 mil­lion (S$19.5 mil­lion) each as kick­backs from a so­lar project for schools in Sarawak.</p>
    <p>The wit­ness, Mr Rayyan Radzwill Ab­dul­lah, was speak­ing at the trial of Ros­mah, 69, in­volv­ing a RM1.25 bil­lion so­lar hy­brid project for Sarawak schools, New Straits Times (NST) on­line news re­ported.</p>
    <p>Ros­mah, the wife of for­mer prime min­is­ter Na­jib, is fac­ing a charge of so­lic­it­ing RM187.5 mil­lion and two counts of re­ceiv­ing a to­tal of RM6.5 mil­lion in ex­change for help­ing Jepak Hold­ings win the so­lar en­ergy project.</p>
    <p>Mr Rayyan, a 41-year-old busi­ness con­sul­tant to Jepak, told the court that he felt dis­gusted about hav­ing to pay kick­backs amount­ing to mil­lions of ring­git to politi­cians and oth­ers so that Jepak could se­cure the project.</p>
    <p>Mr Rayyan was the 16th pros­e­cu­tion wit­ness in the case.</p>
    <p>Un­der ques­tion­ing from the de­fence, he said that Pekan’s Umno sec­re­tary, Datuk Aazmey Abu Talib, had played a big role in help­ing Jepak se­cure the project, NST re­ported. Na­jib is the MP for Pekan ward in Pa­hang.</p>
    <p>Mr Rayyan said Jepak en­tered into a deal with Mr Aazmey to pay him about 4 per cent or 5 per cent of the project’s value, amount­ing to about RM50 mil­lion to RM60 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The wit­ness also said that Jepak’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor, Mr Saidi Abang Sam­sudin, even­tu­ally paid Mr Aazmey a to­tal of RM2 mil­lion in a num­ber of pay­ments.</p>
    <p>“Saidi also con­sis­tently paid Aazmey be­tween RM20,000 and RM30,000 per month from 2016. This was as grat­i­tude for ser­vices ren­dered to help Jepak Hold­ings get the project,” Mr Rayyan said.</p>
    <p>Un­der fur­ther ques­tion­ing, the wit­ness told the court that Mr Mahdzir, the for­mer ed­u­ca­tion min­is­ter, had asked for some 20 per cent or RM250 mil­lion of the project’s value as kick­back, but set­tled for RM60 mil­lion, NST said.</p>
    <p>The sum was to be paid in in­stal­ments of RM1 mil­lion per month over five years, the court heard.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ous re­ports had said Mr Mahdzir, one of the three vice-pres­i­dents of Umno, had de­nied ask­ing for the grat­i­fi­ca­tion when he was called to the stand in Fe­bru­ary, NST re­ported.</p>
