    <p>NEW DELHI • Two men who al­legedly duped a doc­tor into buy­ing an “Aladdin’s lamp” for 7 mil­lion ru­pees (S$128,000) – and even con­jured up a fake ge­nie – have been ar­rested in In­dia, an of­fi­cial said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Dr Laeek Khan filed a re­port with po­lice in the north­ern state of Ut­tar Pradesh af­ter he re­alised the lamp did not have any mag­i­cal pow­ers, as de­scribed in the pop­u­lar folk tale about Aladdin and his wish-grant­ing ge­nie that ap­pears when the lamp is rubbed.</p>
    <p>“The cheats had struck a deal for much more, but the doc­tor had paid about 7 mil­lion ru­pees,” Mr Amit Rai, a se­nior of­fi­cer, told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>He said the men were ar­rested last Thurs­day and re­manded in cus­tody ahead of charges be­ing filed.</p>
    <p>“The wife of one of th­ese men was also in­volved in the fraud. She is on the run,” Mr Rai added.</p>
    <p>In his com­plaint, Dr Khan said one of the men pre­tended to be an oc­cultist and made a “jinn” – a su­per­nat­u­ral fig­ure – ap­pear from the lamp, lo­cal me­dia re­ported. But when Dr Khan asked if he could touch the ge­nie or take the lamp home, they re­fused, say­ing it might cause him harm.</p>
    <p>Even­tu­ally they sold the lamp to him, promis­ing it would bring health, wealth and good for­tune.</p>
    <p>Dr Khan stated that he later re­alised the “ge­nie” was ac­tu­ally just one of the men in dis­guise.</p>
