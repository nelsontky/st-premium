    <p>Fri­days for Fu­ture (FFF) In­dia, a stu­dent-led cli­mate ac­tion move­ment in­spired by 17-year-old Swedish ac­tivist Greta Thun­berg, found its web­site blocked. The Delhi po­lice also charged the group un­der an anti-ter­ror­ism law af­ter the In­dian en­vi­ron­ment min­is­ter com­plained that he was get­ting too many e-mails from the FFF site about draft en­vi­ron­ment rules the gov­ern­ment is seek­ing public re­sponses for.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a public out­cry, the po­lice said the charge was “in­ad­ver­tently” sent and filed a new one un­der the In­for­ma­tion Tech­nol­ogy Act. Two other en­vi­ron­ment col­lec­tives, Let In­dia Breathe and There is no Earth B, also found their web­sites blocked.</p>
    <p>All three green groups have been mo­bil­is­ing peo­ple on­line in op­po­si­tion to a draft En­vi­ron­ment Im­pact As­sess­ment (EIA) no­ti­fi­ca­tion, which en­vi­ron­men­tal­ists say is heav­ily di­lut­ing pro­tec­tions and shrink­ing ways in which af­fected com­mu­ni­ties can ques­tion pol­lu­tion and eco­log­i­cal destruc­tion. The web­site block­ing and po­lice charges are fur­ther ob­struct­ing demo­cratic en­gage­ment, they say.</p>
    <p>“We have been let down by see­ing the dis­course stoop to this level. We want the gov­ern­ment to be trans­par­ent, and to­gether we can fix things. A frag­ile or pol­luted ecosys­tem will not make for a good busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment,” said Mr Yash Mar­wah, a Mum­baibased writer and mem­ber of Let In­dia Breathe.</p>
    <p>The En­vi­ron­men­tal Im­pact As­sess­ment was first no­ti­fied i n 1994, un­der In­dia’s En­vi­ron­ment (Pro­tec­tion) Act, 1986. It pro­vides a le­gal frame­work for safe­guard­ing forests, rivers, the air, and soil from in­dus­trial and in­fras­truc­ture ac­tiv­i­ties that might ac­cess, use or pol­lute them.</p>
    <p>Every in­dus­trial project is re­quired to go through the EIA process and ob­tain an en­vi­ron­men­tal clear­ance be­fore it be­gins. The EIA was mod­i­fied in 2006, and a few times since.</p>
    <p>The new 2020 rules would ex­empt more kinds of projects from hav­ing to con­sult peo­ple whose lives they could af­fect. Ap­proved projects would get clear­ance per­mits for longer du­ra­tions and be mon­i­tored less fre­quently.</p>
    <p>The new rules also say that projects that have vi­o­lated en­vi­ron­men­tal rules can con­tinue to op­er­ate af­ter pay­ing a fine. En­vi­ron­men­tal ac­tivists fear that this would re­ward vi­o­la­tors and weaken al­ready frag­ile en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tions.</p>
    <p>“The 2020 draft is more re­gres­sive than the 2006 ver­sion it seeks to re­place, and just wants to le­galise destruc­tion and pol­lu­tion,” said Ms Bhavreen Khan­dari, who works closely with FFF.</p>
    <p>The new EIA rules will not be dis­cussed in Par­lia­ment but the gov­ern­ment needs to con­sult the public be­fore they are made of­fi­cial. As soon as the draft law was pub­lished on­line, en­vi­ron­men­tal­ists de­cided to cre­ate wider aware­ness and get more In­di­ans in­volved in the con­sul­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Groups like FFF and There is no Earth B, with mostly stu­dent vol­un­teers, joined forces with ex­pe­ri­enced en­vi­ron­men­tal­ists to cre­ate so­cial me­dia ma­te­rial, memes, in­fo­graph­ics and videos about the new EIA. A ma­jor cam­paign en­cour­aged peo­ple to send e-mails to the min­istry.</p>
    <p>“It’s not easy for ev­ery­one to write long e-mails, so we built a tool so that from our web­site, in one click, a per­son can send an e-mail to the en­vi­ron­ment min­istry from their own e-mail ID, in a fixed for­mat,” said Ms Khan­dari. Those who had more time and un­der­stand­ing could edit the text.</p>
    <p>Th­ese were the e-mails the po­lice re­ferred to, which ap­pear to have flooded En­vi­ron­ment Min­is­ter Prakash Javadekar’s in­box. The ex­act com­plaint from the min­is­ter to the Delhi cy­ber­crime unit is not pub­licly avail­able.</p>
    <p>A state­ment from There is no Earth B said they were “bridg­ing the gap cre­ated by a lack of trans­la­tions and wide dis­sem­i­na­tion of in­for­ma­tion, by en­abling public dis­course on the Draft EIA 2020 in not just English but nine dif­fer­ent In­dian lo­cal lan­guages”.</p>
    <p>The Delhi po­lice said it lifted the sus­pen­sions on July 16. But the web­sites are still in­ac­tive un­der some In­ter­net ser­vice providers.</p>
