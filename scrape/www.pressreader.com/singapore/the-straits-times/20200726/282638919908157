    <p>It is a com­mon sight at train and bus sta­tions: Com­muters walk past the QR code on dis­play with­out scan­ning it. Even on taxis, few peo­ple scan the QR code to log their en­tries and ex­its by sup­ply­ing the Gov­ern­ment with their con­tact in­for­ma­tion and iden­tity num­ber.</p>
    <p>The com­mon re­frain: “It’s too cum­ber­some, and I’m in a rush.”</p>
    <p>One com­muter, who wants to be known only as Mr Ng, said: “It is not com­pul­sory.”</p>
    <p>In­deed, ob­servers have crit­i­cised the SafeEn­try QR code check-in sys­tem for be­ing “leaky” as it does not cap­ture com­mu­nity move­ment well, es­pe­cially in pub­lic trans­port net­works, where the risk of Covid-19 trans­mis­sion is high.</p>
    <p>“Even in some build­ings where SafeEn­try’s use is com­pul­sory, I see peo­ple waltz­ing past se­cu­rity with­out hav­ing scanned the QR code,” says Pro­fes­sor Leong Thin Yin from the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sci­ences’ busi­ness pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has 2.2 mil­lion users for na­tional con­tact-trac­ing app TraceTo­gether, launched in March.</p>
    <p>But it is still not large enough for ef­fec­tive dig­i­tal trac­ing; ex­perts have said at least three-quar­ters of the pop­u­la­tion, or 4.2 mil­lion peo­ple, need to be users.</p>
    <p>Last month, the na­tion rolled out a wear­able de­vice called TraceTo­gether To­ken, which works in sim­i­lar ways to the app by us­ing Blue­tooth sig­nal ex­changes to log nearby users.</p>
    <p>Pri­or­ity is given to se­niors with­out smart­phones. But only 10,000 to­kens have been is­sued so far. More are ex­pected next month.</p>
    <p>FIX­ING DIG­I­TAL CON­TACT-TRAC­ING GAPS</p>
    <p>As the threat of a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tion looms large, ex­perts say it is time to ramp up dig­i­tal con­tact trac­ing by plug­ging ex­ist­ing gaps.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, in­fec­tion clus­ters have popped up re­lent­lessly and led to a resur­gence of the Covid-19 virus in places such as Hong Kong, Ja­pan and Aus­tralia – forc­ing the au­thor­i­ties there to re­in­state move­ment curbs and busi­ness shut­downs.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal tools can quicken the con­tact-trac­ing process to just a day from a few days, as con­tact trac­ers rely less on the te­dious process of scan­ning closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion footage and in­ter­view­ing pa­tients and their con­tacts to fig­ure out who had been ex­posed to the virus.</p>
    <p>In the ab­sence of mass test­ing and a vac­cine, such trac­ing tech­nolo­gies are key to pre­vent­ing wide­spread com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion and a sec­ond cir­cuit breaker in Sin­ga­pore as po­ten­tially in­fected peo­ple can be quickly quar­an­tined.</p>
    <p>One ob­vi­ous gap is the ab­sence of dig­i­tal con­tact trac­ing in pub­lic trans­port sys­tems.</p>
    <p>“Have you won­dered why the places fre­quented by Covid-19 cases never in­clude pub­lic trans­port?” Prof Leong asks, point­ing out that these cases were per­haps not be­ing cap­tured in the first place.</p>
    <p>SafeEn­try has been in­stalled at 200,000 lo­ca­tions, in­clud­ing malls, work­places, cabs and pub­lic trans­port – but its use is only en­forced in some places.</p>
    <p>There will be no need to de­ploy en­force­ment of­fi­cers if the tool is sim­pli­fied.</p>
    <p>Prof Leong sug­gests the use of a “static” con­tact trac­ing to­ken in­stalled at premises to au­to­mat­i­cally record check-ins.</p>
    <p>This will be sim­i­lar to what ur­ban and in­fra­struc­ture con­sul­tancy firm Sur­bana Jurong is tri­alling at a con­struc­tion site it man­ages in Tampines.</p>
    <p>Sur­bana Jurong is us­ing Te­masekowned D’Crypt’s con­tact-trac­ing to­ken called BluePass, is­sued to 400 work­ers to log their so­cial en­coun­ters. A ver­sion of BluePass is also in­stalled through­out the site to log en­tries and ex­its.</p>
    <p>“If static TraceTo­gether to­kens are placed at the en­try and exit points of premises, vis­i­tors can be ef­fec­tively recorded,” says Prof Leong. But this works only when the TraceTo­gether To­ken or app is widely used.</p>
    <p>The Blue­tooth sig­nal strength recorded be­tween the con­tact-trac­ing apps and de­vices es­ti­mates the dis­tance be­tween users and du­ra­tion of en­coun­ters.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple within 2m of a Covid-19 pa­tient for 30 min­utes will be put un­der quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>IM­PROVE PAR­TIC­I­PA­TION RATE</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal con­tact trac­ing par­tic­i­pa­tion can be im­proved in two ways: Make TraceTo­gether com­pul­sory in some in­stances, such as when seek­ing to gain en­try to venues, and in­te­grate it with to­kens cre­ated by the pri­vate sec­tor.</p>
    <p>“Just as we need to flash SafeEn­try passes to go into a su­per­mar­ket, we could show we have ac­ti­vated the TraceTo­gether app or the to­ken if we want to en­ter cer­tain places or when tak­ing pub­lic trans­port,” says As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Alex Cook, vice-dean of re­search at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health.</p>
    <p>He cites the ex­am­ple of NUS, which has man­dated the use of TraceTo­gether among teach­ers and stu­dents.</p>
    <p>“I’m in favour of in­va­sive con­tact trac­ing dur­ing a se­ri­ous in­fec­tious dis­ease out­break such as this one, be­cause the risk of a loved one tak­ing se­ri­ously ill or dy­ing out­weighs the loss of pri­vacy. We im­plic­itly ac­cept this trade-off by us­ing SafeEn­try to en­ter shops or restau­rants,” says Prof Cook.</p>
    <p>Users of TraceTo­gether and SafeEn­try have to pro­vide their full iden­tity num­ber – NRIC, FIN or pass­port – and mo­bile num­ber to the au­thor­i­ties, who had said the in­for­ma­tion would be pro­tected and not used un­less nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>D’Crypt chief ex­ec­u­tive Antony Ng sug­gests that the Gov­ern­ment share the com­mu­ni­ca­tions pro­to­cols of TraceTo­gether with pri­vate sec­tor devel­op­ers so that dif­fer­ent con­tact-trac­ing to­kens can “talk” to one another.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing mul­ti­ple par­ties man­u­fac­ture and dis­trib­ute these de­vices will en­sure more peo­ple re­ceive the de­vices for bet­ter con­tact trac­ing,” says Mr Ng.</p>
    <p>There are plans for BluePass to be rolled out to 30,000 work­ers at the 15 con­struc­tion sites Sur­bana Jurong man­ages as early as next month. D’Crypt is also in dis­cus­sions to pi­lot BluePass in the petro­chem­i­cal, med­i­cal equip­ment man­u­fac­tur­ing, mar­itime and con­struc­tion in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment Group, which is be­hind the na­tional con­tact-trac­ing tech­nolo­gies, tells The Sun­day Times: “We are open to greater pri­vate-pub­lic sec­tor col­lab­o­ra­tion, and are ex­plor­ing ways in which we can work with the in­dus­try on the TraceTo­gether pro­gramme to im­prove our dig­i­tal con­tact-trac­ing tools.”</p>
