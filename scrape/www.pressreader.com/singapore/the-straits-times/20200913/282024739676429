    <p>LONDON James Ro­driguez’s re­union with Carlo Ancelotti at Ever­ton, af­ter two ear­lier spells to­gether at Real Madrid and Bay­ern Mu­nich, shows there is no lack of am­bi­tion on the blue side of Mersey­side to force them­selves into the English Premier League’s top six.</p>
    <p>But their bil­lion­aire owner Farhad Moshiri’s lav­ish spend­ing has yet to bear much fruit at Good­i­son Park. Since the Bri­tish-Ira­nian busi­ness­man took a con­trol­ling stake in the club in Fe­bru­ary 2016, over £400 mil­lion (S$700 mil­lion) has been spent on new play­ers and the hir­ing and fir­ing of high-pro­file coaches.</p>
    <p>Last sea­son, they fin­ished 12th af­ter Ancelotti took over in De­cem­ber, but the Ital­ian has em­barked on a com­plete re­build of his mid­field this sum­mer. Brazil in­ter­na­tional Al­lan and French­man Ab­doulaye Doucoure have each cost £20 mil­lion, with £12 mil­lion James spear­head­ing the new-look trio.</p>
    <p>Ex­press­ing his hap­pi­ness with Ever­ton’s business in the trans­fer mar­ket, Ancelotti, who has won three Cham­pi­ons League ti­tles with AC Mi­lan and Real Madrid and the Premier League with Chelsea in 2010, is tar­get­ing a Europa League spot this term.</p>
    <p>“The club did a fan­tas­tic j ob, th­ese play­ers were the pri­or­ity for us,” he said. “The goal we want to achieve is to fight... to be able to reach Europe next sea­son.</p>
    <p>“The play­ers who ar­rived un­der­stand we have a project with am­bi­tion for the fu­ture. They are go­ing to work to put their qual­ity into the team and this club.”</p>
    <p>He needs more cover at cen­tre­back as Yerry Mina has been ham­pered by nig­gling in­juries, while there are ques­tion marks over at­tack­ers Richarli­son, Do­minic Calvert-Lewin and Moise Kean.</p>
    <p>Ever­ton’s sea­son starts to­day at Tottenham, and Spurs man­ager Jose Mour­inho feels their op­po­nents are now ready to go places af­ter a slow start to Ancelotti’s reign.</p>
    <p>“When a coach of Carlo’s di­men­sion goes to a club, it is not to try to not be rel­e­gated, or to try to stay in mid-ta­ble,” Mour­inho ex­plained. “It is easy to un­der­stand what Ever­ton want, what Carlo wants.</p>
    <p>“Then you look to the mar­ket. They brought play­ers of high qual­ity, they know Carlo well and a good squad be­comes a much stronger squad.</p>
    <p>“So I look at them as di­rect op­po­nents (for the top six).”</p>
