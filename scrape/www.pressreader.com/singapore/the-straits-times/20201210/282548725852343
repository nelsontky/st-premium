    <p>This year’s re­cip­i­ents of the Young Artist Award span the range from tra­di­tional artist to mul­ti­me­dia prac­ti­tioner. The four re­cip­i­ents will each re­ceive a tro­phy, a cer­tifi­cate and a $20,000 grant to fur­ther their work. The award, first given out by the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil (NAC) in 1992 to those 35 and younger, aims to en­cour­age young artists in the pur­suit of their prac­tice.</p>
    <p>YANYUN CHEN, 34, ARTIST</p>
    <p>Chen’s work is lit­er­ally on fire. She re­cently blew out a wall plug and crashed half a server farm while ren­der­ing a huge com­puter file for a new project.</p>
    <p>She hastily clar­i­fies: “My CGI guy and his four cats are alive and well.”</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent, she says wryly, sums up this “re­ally rough year”: “The tool­box is out and you’re try­ing to fix things all the time.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides pur­su­ing her artis­tic prac­tice, she teaches full-time at Yale-NUS Col­lege and also founded an­i­ma­tion stu­dio Pi­platchka and pub­lish­ing com­pany Delere Press.</p>
    <p>She kicked off this pan­demic with a solo show at S.E.A. Fo­cus, par­tic­i­pated virtually in the Buenos Aires Bi­en­nale of Mov­ing Images and earned ac­co­lades for her short film Women In Rage.</p>
    <p>She is “su­per, su­per happy” about the Young Artist Award: “It was very un­ex­pected.”</p>
    <p>Best known for her hy­per-re­al­is­tic char­coals­ketched flow­ers, Chen is also keen on film, hav­ing earned a Bach­e­lor of Fine Arts in An­i­ma­tion from Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity. “The Young Artist Award gives me a lot of en­cour­age­ment to pur­sue dif­fer­ent kinds of work,” she says.</p>
    <p>She is ex­plor­ing the idea of gen­tle­ness, in­spired by her late teacher, the French philoso­pher Anne Du­four­man­telle. “She was very keen on this idea of in­ves­ti­gat­ing the nu­ances be­hind gen­tle­ness and how ac­tu­ally we don’t re­ally un­der­stand what gen­tle­ness means with­out the idea of sav­agery.”</p>
    <p>The Ge­or­gette Chen Fel­low is also fur­ther­ing her re­search on nu­dity in Sin­ga­pore art, build­ing on her doc­toral the­sis which ex­plored the poli­cies, me­dia cov­er­age and guide­lines around the is­sue.</p>
    <p>“It’s in­ter­est­ing to look at liv­ing artists and es­tates, how ev­ery­one felt around their prac­tice. It’s try­ing to build a uni­verse of un­der­stand­ing, to come up with our own def­i­ni­tion of nu­dity that’s not Western­cen­tric.”</p>
    <p>SUSHMA SOMA, 33, CAR­NATIC VO­CAL­IST</p>
    <p>The singer was sup­posed to have been on a United States tour this au­tumn with a stop at Chicago’s World Mu­sic Fes­ti­val, which would have made her the first Sin­ga­porean to per­form at the 21-year-old event.</p>
    <p>“It was a bit of a bum­mer,” Soma says. None­the­less, she is im­mensely grate­ful for all she has this year.</p>
    <p>“I’m very for­tu­nate that I have a very sup­port­ive fam­ily, I have a roof above my head and, most im­por­tantly, that I’m in Sin­ga­pore. I say that with all grat­i­tude be­cause I’m leav­ing for the US in two weeks.”</p>
    <p>She is head­ing to Los An­ge­les to work with com­poser-mu­si­cian Aditya Prakash on a new al­bum which com­bines her mu­sic prac­tice with a topic she is pas­sion­ate about – the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>She says half-jok­ingly: “It re­ally feels like I’m step­ping into a sort of death­trap. I’m very lucky I was in Sin­ga­pore this year be­cause it’s re­ally pro­vided all the safety I needed.”</p>
    <p>This project is also funded by the NAC via the Cre­ation Grant which sup­ports new work, so Soma has not con­sid­ered what to do with her $20,000 for the Young Artist ac­co­lade.</p>
    <p>The singer, who teaches In­dian mu­sic at the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Ed­u­ca­tion and is mar­ried to an IT pro­fes­sional, says that when she first re­ceived the NAC’s call about her win, she thought it was a prank call.</p>
    <p>Chortling, she adds: “I have done pranks like that, so this would be karma.”</p>
    <p>Jokes aside, she is ap­pre­cia­tive of the fund­ing sup­port which al­lows her to make new work. “It means a lot that the NAC be­lieves in my project and is will­ing to put the money on it, to put it crudely. That comes with a lot of re­spon­si­bil­ity.”</p>
