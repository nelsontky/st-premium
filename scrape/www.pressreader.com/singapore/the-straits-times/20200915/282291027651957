    <p>Over the past nine years of fol­low­ing the Tour de France, cy­cling fan Mer­rill Chua, 23, would watch the race on tele­vi­sion to ob­serve the tac­tics of the front run­ners.</p>
    <p>But to fully keep up with his favourite rid­ers such as Ed­vald Boas­son Ha­gen and Tony Martin, who race for NTT Pro Cy­cling and Jumbo-Visma re­spec­tively, he had to rely on high­light reels posted on YouTube.</p>
    <p>This year, Chua, a third-year physics un­der­grad­u­ate at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity, can track the per­for­mance of all cy­clists at any point in the race through the new race cen­tre web­site launched by NTT, tech­nol­ogy part­ner of Tour de France or­gan­is­ers Amaury Sport Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>It pro­vides data like weather con­di­tions, live rider teleme­try, race com­men­tary and race pre­dic­tions.</p>
    <p>These cus­tomised of­fer­ings il­lus­trate one of the many ways or­gan­is­ers have en­hanced fan ex­pe­ri­ence this year. Un­like pre­vi­ous edi­tions, when 12 mil­lion peo­ple usu­ally gath­ered along the 3,500km route, at­ten­dance for the start of this year’s Tour was capped at 5,000 be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, or­gan­is­ers said no spec­ta­tors would be al­lowed at any of the fin­ishes of the Tour’s stages. The Tour started on Aug 29 and ends on Sept 20.</p>
    <p>Chua, who rep­re­sented Sin­ga­pore in the 2015 UCI Road World Cham­pi­onships in the men’s ju­nior cat­e­gories, said: “Usu­ally when I see the rid­ers sprint­ing on TV, com­men­ta­tors will say what their speed is roughly but I want to know down to the dec­i­mal places their ex­act speed. This is very in­sight­ful es­pe­cially for as­pir­ing rid­ers be­cause you get to know these de­tails and con­di­tions and you can try to sim­u­late them.</p>
    <p>“Now fans can also see what’s go­ing on be­hind the scenes and they will ap­pre­ci­ate the sport even more be­cause they un­der­stand how teams work.”</p>
    <p>Na­tional cy­clist Calvin Sim added: “This is a great way for fans to ex­pe­ri­ence how i ntense the</p>
    <p>Tour de France is. Not many other sports pro­vide this kind of in­sight and data dur­ing com­pe­ti­tions.”</p>
    <p>Other fea­tures in­clude a new aug­mented re­al­ity app that al­lows 1,000 users to see the ter­rain in 3D with in­ter­ac­tive live data.</p>
    <p>Peter Gray, se­nior vice-pres­i­dent of the ad­vanced tech­nol­ogy group for sport at NTT, said these dig­i­tal plat­forms work in tan­dem with the tele­vi­sion broad­cast to en­rich the fan ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>He noted: “Fans can watch the broad­cast on TV for the ac­tion and scenery while they’ve also got these plat­forms to give them more de­tailed data and high­lights.</p>
    <p>“The at­mos­phere of be­ing at a huge event like the Tour de France with mil­lions of peo­ple at the road­side is not some­thing you can ever com­pletely repli­cate in the vir­tual world. But we can give the best pos­si­ble view of ev­ery­thing hap­pen­ing in the race in data.”</p>
