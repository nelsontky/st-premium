    <p>Kopi, laksa and win­dow shop­ping are quintessen­tially Sin­ga­porean pur­suits. So it is no sur­prise that they are cel­e­brated in cham­ber opera com­pany L’ari­etta’s A Sin­ga­pore Tril­ogy.</p>
    <p>L’ari­etta’s co-founder and artis­tic di­rec­tor Akiko Otao, 36, says: “When this is all over, we want to get out of the house to dine-in at our favourite places, mourn for the loss of our loved ones prop­erly and do some win­dow shop­ping.”</p>
    <p>The home-grown com­pany com­mis­sioned the cham­ber opera se­ries from the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil Young Artist Award win­ner, Dr Chen Zhangyi, over a pe­riod of five years.</p>
    <p>For the grand fi­nale to the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil and The Straits Times’ 30 Days Of Art, L’ari­etta has repack­aged Kopi For One, Laksa Can­tata and Win­dow Shop­ping into a trio of short films.</p>
    <p>This new take re­united the cast from the 2018 stag­ing: singers Otao, Sa­muel Ng, 25, and Phoebe Chee, 21, who re­hearsed over Zoom un­der the guid­ing hand of theatre vet­eran Nora Samosir.</p>
    <p>Otao says: “Nora helped us with the char­ac­ter work over Zoom, which was chal­leng­ing. Due to the lag, I feel like we be­come more re­served and hes­i­tant when start­ing to speak, which breaks up the na­ture and the art of con­ver­sa­tion. It’s less or­ganic, in that sense.”</p>
    <p>For the video pro­duc­tion, the com­pany called on artist Alvin Mark Tan, 44, who cre­ated an­i­ma­tions to aug­ment the sto­ry­telling.</p>
    <p>He says: “We had to im­pro­vise a few of our shots given the tight dead­line and strict drone laws in Sin­ga­pore, and come up with so­lu­tions as close to the ini­tial de­sired look.”</p>
    <p>The team mem­bers say the project was a learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Samosir, 62, says: “I’m ap­pre­ci­at­ing the ex­pe­ri­ence of work­ing with new col­lab­o­ra­tors be­cause ad­just­ing and shar­ing my own ex­pec­ta­tions and view­points on cre­at­ing the­atri­cal per­for­mances have sharp­ened my skills and work prac­tices.”</p>
    <p>She hopes such dig­i­tal plat­forms will con­tinue post-Covid-19, “such that video record­ing is not just for ar­chiv­ing theatre but be part and par­cel of pre­sent­ing theatre to our au­di­ences”.</p>
    <p>She says: “As clas­si­cal mu­si­cians, we have been fo­cus­ing and trained on per­form­ing live. And to be switch­ing into record­ings, like for a tele­vi­sion drama was ex­tremely dif­fer­ent and an ex­pe­ri­ence to learn from.”</p>
    <p>While she is grate­ful for the chance to make art, al­beit at a dis­tance, she ob­serves: “Hu­man con­nec­tions are not as eas­ily repli­cated on­line. I’m sure it’s the same for ev­ery­one else. We’re miss­ing the hu­man pres­ence.”</p>
    <p>Still, ev­ery­one is look­ing at the sil­ver lin­ing. As L’ari­etta’s co-founder and artis­tic di­rec­tor Reuben Lai, 46, says: “We em­braced the pain of hav­ing our lives up­ended, our dreams and hopes put on hold to meet this cri­sis head on. The price we paid was the pain of an un­cer­tain fu­ture, of sched­ules wrecked and jobs lost and loved ones separated.</p>
    <p>“To know that we do not face it alone can be a great com­fort.”</p>
