    <p>• When Demo­cratic Party pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den picked Ms Ka­mala Har­ris to be his run­ning mate, it sparked a frenzy on the other side of the globe to track down her con­nec­tions to Chen­nai, the south­ern In­dian city where her mother was born.</p>
    <p>On Twit­ter and Face­book, a flurry of users chron­i­cled ev­ery minute link, in­clud­ing her grand­par­ents’ home in the Be­sant Na­gar neigh­bour­hood, from where her mother Shya­mala Gopalan set off as a teenager to pur­sue a doc­toral de­gree at the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia Berke­ley.</p>
    <p>Un­dated pho­tos sur­faced of Ms Har­ris and her younger sib­ling Maya in saris, smil­ingly pos­ing with their grand­par­ents dur­ing a visit.</p>
    <p>Many saw Ms Har­ris as a step away from the White House, and the de facto Demo­cratic Party front run­ner in four or eight years.</p>
    <p>Writer Cau­very Mad­ha­van cap­tured the hys­te­ria in a tweet: “If you’re won­der­ing what that loud windy up sound is – it’s all of Chen­nai crank­ing the #SixDe­greesOfSep­a­ra­tion ma­chine!! Any mo­ment now my mother is go­ing to tri­umphantly re­veal that her phar­ma­cist’s fa­ther was @KamalaHarr­is’s grandma’s pre­ferred tai­lor.”</p>
    <p>An­other Twit­ter user Priya Ravichan­dran jested that she was “asked to Google and find which rel­a­tive lives in Be­sant Na­gar”, adding that peo­ple are “this close” to rent­ing a party bus and do­ing a “driveby near their house” to cel­e­brate Ms Har­ris.</p>
    <p>Sen­a­tor Har­ris is the first per­son of In­dian de­scent and the first black woman on a ma­jor ticket in a United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion. In­dian me­dia out­lets, analysing the geopo­lit­i­cal im­pact of her rise, ar­gued a Bi­den-Har­ris win would fur­ther shore up a US-In­dia re­la­tion­ship that has al­ready im­proved markedly un­der In­dian Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi.</p>
    <p>The closer ties be­tween Mr Modi and US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump cul­mi­nated in two giant sta­dium events in front of tens of thou­sands of sup­port­ers – one in Hous­ton last Septem­ber that saw the two lead­ers walk­ing hand in hand to a rock­star-like re­cep­tion, and the other in Mr Modi’s home state of Gu­jarat in Fe­bru­ary this year.</p>
    <p>Still, the warm­ing re­la­tions have not yet led to a long-an­tic­i­pated US-In­dia trade deal, although New Delhi is now pur­chas­ing more weapons from the US, in­clud­ing a new de­fence agree­ment worth more than US$3 bil­lion (S$4.1 bil­lion) signed dur­ing Mr Trump’s visit to In­dia ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal out­lets and TV crews raced to hunt down an as­sort­ment of Ms Har­ris’ aunts and even a great-un­cle who de­tailed her vis­its to the sprawl­ing me­trop­o­lis and her strolls on its hu­mid beaches dis­cussing democ­racy and equal­ity with her grand­fa­ther, a re­tired gov­ern­ment of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>A prom­i­nent lo­cal news­pa­per, The Hindu Busi­nessLine, car­ried the head­line, “Ka­mala Devi Har­ris and the des­tiny-chang­ing co­conuts from Chen­nai”.</p>
    <p>The story de­scribed Ms Har­ris’ aunt pray­ing for her vic­tory in the Cal­i­for­nia Se­nate elec­tions nine years ago by break­ing 108 co­conuts, a pop­u­lar re­li­gious rit­ual, at the lo­cal tem­ple.</p>
    <p>The pa­per quoted Ms Har­ris phon­ing her aunt to say: “Chithi (Aunt), please pray for me and break co­conuts at the tem­ple.”</p>
    <p>Twit­ter users high­lighted her In­di­an­ness, be­gin­ning with the name Ka­mala, which means lo­tus in sev­eral In­dian lan­guages.</p>
    <p>CNN’s lo­cal part­ner tweeted that Ms Har­ris loves idlis and samb­har – fluffy rice cakes and spicy len­til stew of­ten eaten for break­fast in In­dia, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The fuss over her po­lit­i­cal el­e­va­tion this week far out­stripped the ex­cite­ment over the rise of other Chen­nai-con­nected per­son­al­i­ties such as ac­tress Mindy Kal­ing and Al­pha­bet Inc chief ex­ec­u­tive Sun­dar Pichai.</p>
    <p>While hun­dreds of Twit­ter users in In­dia posted l auda­tory mes­sages, some rued that Ms Har­ris’ nom­i­na­tion would in­flate the al­ready lofty ex­pec­ta­tions of In­dian par­ents for their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>In­dian law­maker and prom­i­nent op­po­si­tion Congress party mem­ber Shashi Tha­roor tweeted: “Beta (Son), what are you do­ing these days? Oh, just a Har­vard pro­fes­sor? Not even mayor yet?”</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris, whose fa­ther is of Ja­maican an­ces­try, has down­played her fam­ily’s In­dia ties although she has spo­ken of how the deep con­ver­sa­tions with her grand­fa­ther dur­ing her vis­its to In­dia helped shape her po­lit­i­cal views.</p>
    <p>But so­cial me­dia users were quick to ap­pro­pri­ate her as com­pletely In­dian.</p>
    <p>A video from last year in which she is seen with Ms Kal­ing mak­ing a masala dosa, a south In­dian savoury crepe filled with spicy pota­toes, is cir­cu­lat­ing wildly on What­sApp groups in In­dia.</p>
