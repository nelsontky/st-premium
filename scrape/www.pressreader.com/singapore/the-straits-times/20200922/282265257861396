    <p>Af­ter a week­end of bas­kets and goals, af­ter un­flap­pable Liver­pool and un­stop­pable Tadej Pogacar at the Tour de France, af­ter an ag­i­tated Novak Djokovic and a bi­cep-flex­ing Bryson DeCham­beau, here’s the real ques­tion we should ask:</p>
    <p>Would we do what Diego Men­trida did? Would we have stopped?</p>
    <p>It’s pos­si­ble you haven’t heard about Men­trida yet but it’s un­der­stand­able, for he isn’t par­tic­u­larly fa­mous or eas­ily recog­nis­able and yet he pro­duced an act of such sim­plic­ity this month, it will shake you up.</p>
    <p>In a triathlon in Spain, a Bri­tish triath­lete James Tea­gle who was in third place, mis­read the signs, went 50m the wrong way and then, as is ap­par­ent in a video, crashes into a metal bar­rier close to the fin­ish line. In the en­su­ing chaos,</p>
    <p>Men­trida over­takes him.</p>
    <p>Bad luck, Tea­gle?</p>
    <p>No, good guy Men­trida.</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard stops be­fore the fin­ish line. He waits. He lets Tea­gle cross the line be­fore him in third place. “He de­served it,” Men­trida said later and yet he had done what ath­letes are trained not to do. To give way.</p>
    <p>Vic­tory ev­ery day is helped along by er­ror, by a de­fender slip­ping in the rain for in­stance, but this was dif­fer­ent. This was not the nor­mal course of play, not the break­ing of strings on a racket but a mis­read­ing of di­rec­tions. Men­trida was aware that if it wasn’t for Tea­gle – who was ev­i­dently un­aware of the way – run­ning into the bar­rier the Bri­tish triath­lete would be ahead. The race, he de­cided, de­served a de­cent end­ing.</p>
    <p>Still, would we have stopped? No one would have raised a crit­i­cal eye­brow had Men­trida taken ad­van­tage of his luck. Too bad, he might have told Tea­gle, and we may have agreed. Nev­er­the­less, in what Tea­gle called a show of “in­cred­i­ble sports­man­ship and in­tegrity”, Men­trida halted and it is such an af­fect­ing mo­ment that you will rewind the video and watch it re­peat­edly.</p>
    <p>There is no fuss from him, no flour­ish, just re­spect for Tea­gle and the sport he com­petes in. Men­trida must have been tired for this is the triathlon and yet in ex­haus­tion he found clar­ity. His in­stincts, we might say, were beau­ti­ful. In the heat of the mo­ment, the great­est ex­cuse for id­iocy in sport, he found his finest self.</p>
    <p>And so let’s ask again, would we have stopped? Is it in us? Do we care enough for sport?</p>
    <p>Re­ports say the or­gan­is­ers gave Men­trida the same prize money as third place, a case of one fine ges­ture spark­ing an­other. But Men­trida did not know this when he stopped for Tea­gle. He did not think of the cost and al­ways there is one. To give way is to sac­ri­fice prize money, rank­ing points, a podium place, pre­sum­ably the very rea­sons why Men­trida com­petes.</p>
    <p>Win­ning is now hard­wired into young hu­mans, who are in­structed that this is what you play for. Coaches scream it, news­pa­pers trum­pet it, en­tire doc­u­men­taries – The Last Dance – are fo­cused on it. So Men­trida, in ef­fect, is go­ing against the grain, he is prov­ing that an al­ter­na­tive the­ory ex­ists where there is room for sports­man­ship.</p>
    <p>This hardly sul­lies sport, it en­riches it and gives it a shine, but it only comes from good school­ing. Men­trida wrote on Instagram that “this is some­thing that my par­ents and my club have taught me since I was lit­tle. In my opin­ion it should be con­sid­ered as a nor­mal sit­u­a­tion”. When Tea­gle thanked him – and he did so re­peat­edly – the Spa­niard shrugged. He made the as­ton­ish­ing look rou­tine.</p>
    <p>It has been a hard time for ath­letes lately and yet a fine time for sport. Sports­peo­ple have spo­ken out against sex­ism by com­men­ta­tors, have chal­lenged racism and po­lice bru­tal­ity, have qui­etly worn masks of protest, have</p>
    <p>Men­trida re­minded us that sports­man­ship can’t just be an ideal, it has to be prac­tised, else spirit be­comes just an empty word we ut­ter at school assem­blies. A young man, only 21, stopped when to run was eas­ier and in do­ing so he made us pause.</p>
    <p>taken a prin­ci­pled stand. On fields, skill has come al­lied with char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>Else­where Vic­to­ria Azarenka, 31, com­forted a weep­ing Daria Kasatk­ina, 23, when her ri­val rolled an an­kle, helped put ice on it and packed her racket bag. Ri­valry is hol­low with­out re­spect and Liver­pool’s Jur­gen Klopp ad­ver­tised foot­ball’s best side when he barked at a team of­fi­cial who cel­e­brated Chelsea’s red card: “Are you crazy? We never ever do that, okay?”</p>
    <p>Men­trida re­minded us that sports­man­ship can’t just be an ideal, it has to be prac­tised, else spirit be­comes just an empty word we ut­ter at school assem­blies. A young man, only 21, stopped when to run – and claim third place – was eas­ier and in do­ing so he made us pause. He an­swered his con­science and in­ad­ver­tently posed a ques­tion:</p>
    <p>Would we have stopped?</p>
    <p>And why not?</p>
