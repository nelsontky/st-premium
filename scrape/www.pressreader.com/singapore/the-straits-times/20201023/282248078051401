    <p>•</p>
    <p>Haas driv­ers Ro­main Gros­jean and Kevin Mag­nussen will leave the For­mula One team at the end of this sea­son, the pair an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Their re­place­ments have not been an­nounced, but Amer­i­canowned Haas have re­port­edly ap­proached Rus­sian Nikita Mazepin and his fel­low For­mula Two driver Mick Schu­macher, the son of Ger­man seven-time F1 world cham­pion Michael.</p>
    <p>“I would like to thank Ro­main and Kevin for their hard work and com­mit­ment to Haas over the past few sea­sons,” said team man­ager Guen­ther Steiner.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion comes on the eve of first prac­tice for the Por­tuguese Grand Prix, which flags off on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Den­mark’s Mag­nussen, who also had spells at McLaren and Re­nault, joined Haas in 2017 but has only scored one point so far this year.</p>
    <p>“I am still work­ing on my plans for the fu­ture, which I will an­nounce in due course,” the 28-year-old said in a so­cial me­dia post. He has re­peat­edly ex­pressed an in­ter­est in racing in the IndyCar Se­ries and he told Dan­ish daily BT</p>
    <p>Haas’ Kevin Mag­nussen and Ro­main Gros­jean be­fore the Span­ish race in Au­gust. They will leave at the sea­son’s end. he was ex­plor­ing other av­enues.</p>
    <p>“I haven’t won a race in seven years and that won’t hap­pen in 2021 if I con­tinue in F1,” Mag­nussen said. Added Gros­jean: “The last chap­ter is closed and the book is fin­ished. I’ve learnt a lot, im­proved to be a bet­ter driver as well as a bet­ter man.”</p>
    <p>The French­man, who claimed 10 podium fin­ishes ear­lier in his ca­reer at Lo­tus, posted his first points of the sea­son with ninth place in the most re­cent Eifel Grand Prix .</p>
    <p>The 34-year-old has hinted that he could join the World En­durance Cham­pi­onship or For­mula E.</p>
    <p>The chances of Mag­nussen and Gros­jean re­main­ing in F1 next sea­son are bleak, with the ex­pe­ri­enced pair of Ser­gio Perez – who will leave Racing Point at the end of the cam­paign – and Nico Hulken­berg also cur­rently with­out a 2021 seat.</p>
    <p>Racing Point have brought Hulken­berg to the Al­garve In­ter­na­tional Cir­cuit and he will act as a standby, although the team yes­ter­day said that they ex­pect driver Lance Stroll, who re­vealed ear­lier in the week he had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, to race this week­end.</p>
