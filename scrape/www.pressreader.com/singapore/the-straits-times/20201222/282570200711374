    <p>TIGER WOODS 15-TIME MA­JOR CHAM­PION, af­ter team­ing up with 11-year-old son Char­lie to fin­ish sev­enth at the PNC Cham­pi­onship</p>
    <p>Team Thomas, com­pris­ing world No. 3 Justin Thomas and his fa­ther-coach Mike, won the PNC Cham­pi­onship on Sun­day at The Ritz-Carl­ton Golf Club Grande Lakes.</p>
    <p>The duo opened with seven con­sec­u­tive birdies, and Mike drained a birdie putt on the 18th hole for a round of 15-un­der 57 in the scram­ble for­mat.</p>
    <p>They earned a one-shot vic­tory over Vi­jay Singh and son Qass in the an­nual win­ter team event that fea­tures 20 teams of Ma­jor cham­pi­ons paired with a fam­ily mem­ber.</p>
    <p>Team Thomas fin­ished 25 un­der af­ter post­ing eight birdies on the front side and seven on the back nine to win t he US$200,000 (S$267,600) first prize.</p>
    <p>“Wish ev­ery tour­na­ment was as fun as this one,” tweeted Justin, a 13-time PGA Tour win­ner who was play­ing this event for the first time. “Love you pops. What a week!!”</p>
    <p>The two-day event also saw 15-time Ma­jor win­ner Tiger Woods make his maiden ap­pear­ance with 11-year-old son Char­lie.</p>
    <p>The pair wore Tiger’s tra­di­tional Sun­day red with black trousers, fir­ing a sec­ond con­sec­u­tive 10-un­der 62 to fin­ish sev­enth, five shots back of the win­ners.</p>
    <p>Char­lie is the youngest and per­haps, its most an­tic­i­pated com­peti­tor in PNC Cham­pi­onship his­tory, and ob­servers noted he al­ready takes af­ter his fa­ther.</p>
    <p>He flashed a Tiger-like fist pump af­ter mak­ing a 10-foot birdie putt at No. 10, lead­ing the for­mer world No. 1 to de­clare he was a proud par­ent.</p>
    <p>“It was in­cred­i­bly spe­cial for us to have the op­por­tu­nity to spend the qual­ity time we had,” Woods said. “I don’t think words can de­scribe it. Just the fact that we were able to have this ex­pe­ri­ence to­gether, it’s mem­o­ries we’ll have for our en­tire lives.</p>
    <p>“It was spe­cial for both of us. He’s not go­ing to ap­pre­ci­ate this at 11 years old. As the years go by, you start ap­pre­ci­at­ing it more... I’m proud of how he han­dled every­thing.”</p>
    <p>Team O’Meara (Mark and son Shaun) and Team Trevino (Lee and son Daniel) tied for third at 23 un­der.</p>
    <p>The event used a scram­ble for­mat that al­lows both team mem­bers to hit a tee shot and then se­lect the pre­ferred shot. This con­tin­ues un­til the hole is com­pleted.</p>
