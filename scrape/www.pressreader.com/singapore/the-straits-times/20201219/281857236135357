    <p>•</p>
    <p>Chi­nese tech giant Alibaba has sought to dis­tance it­self from a face-recog­ni­tion soft­ware fea­ture de­vised by its cloud com­put­ing unit that could help users to iden­tify mem­bers of the coun­try’s Mus­lim Uighur mi­nor­ity.</p>
    <p>A re­port this week re­veal­ing the soft­ware fea­ture made Alibaba – one of the world’s most valu­able com­pa­nies – the lat­est Chi­nese cor­po­rate en­tity to be em­broiled in con­tro­versy over China’s treat­ment of Uighurs.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment posted online late on Thurs­day, Alibaba said it was “dis­mayed to learn” that Alibaba Cloud de­vel­oped the fea­ture.</p>
    <p>The tech­nol­ogy was used only for ca­pa­bil­ity test­ing and not de­ployed by any cus­tomer, Alibaba said, adding that it had “elim­i­nated any eth­nic tag” in its prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Alibaba de­scribes Cloud Shield as a sys­tem that “de­tects and recog­nises text, pic­tures, videos and voices con­tain­ing pornog­ra­phy, pol­i­tics, vi­o­lent ter­ror­ism, ad­ver­tise­ments and spam, and pro­vides ver­i­fi­ca­tion, mark­ing, cus­tom con­fig­u­ra­tion and other ca­pa­bil­i­ties”.</p>
    <p>An archived record of the tech­nol­ogy shows it can per­form such tasks as “glasses in­spec­tion”, “smile de­tec­tion”, whether the sub­ject is “eth­nic” and, specif­i­cally, “Is it Uighur”.</p>
    <p>Alibaba said: “We do not and will not per­mit our tech­nol­ogy to be used to tar­get or iden­tify spe­cific eth­nic groups.”</p>
    <p>The Uighur is­sue looms as a wor­ry­ing threat for Chi­nese com­pa­nies as global crit­i­cism grows over Bei­jing’s poli­cies i n the north-west re­gion of Xin­jiang.</p>
    <p>Rights groups say that as many as one mil­lion Uighurs and other mostly Mus­lim mi­nori­ties have been held in in­tern­ment camps there.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing ini­tially de­nied the camps’ ex­is­tence, but later called them vo­ca­tional train­ing cen­tres aimed at of­fer­ing al­ter­na­tives to re­li­gious ex­trem­ism.</p>
    <p>China’s Uighurs, a Mus­lim peo­ple of Tur­kic ori­gin, have for decades chafed at Chi­nese con­trol, and the anger has pe­ri­od­i­cally ex­ploded into deadly vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>Sur­veil­lance spend­ing in Xin­jiang has risen sharply in re­cent years, with fa­cial recog­ni­tion and other tech­nolo­gies de­ployed across the province.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton last year black­listed eight Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies for al­leged links to the sur­veil­lance ef­fort.</p>
    <p>Last week, United States-based sur­veil­lance re­search firm IPVM said Chi­nese telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions com­pany Huawei had been in­volved in test­ing fa­cial recog­ni­tion soft­ware that could send alerts to po­lice when Uighur faces were recog­nised.</p>
    <p>Huawei de­nied the claim.</p>
    <p>But the con­tro­versy caused Barcelona’s World Cup-win­ning French foot­ball star An­toine Griez­mann to sever an en­dorse­ment deal with Huawei.</p>
    <p>Alibaba is the leader in China’s huge e-com­merce sec­tor, pro­ject­ing a sunny im­age to the world epit­o­mised by globe-trot­ting founder and bil­lion­aire for­mer chair­man Jack Ma.</p>
