    <p>MEETUP</p>
    <p>Meetup started in the United States in 2002 and, as of March this year, had 49 mil­lion users world­wide.</p>
    <p>On this web-based plat­form, or­gan­is­ers pay to cre­ate a group.</p>
    <p>This can cost from US$4.99 (S$6.94) a month, which al­lows or­gan­is­ers to open three groups with un­lim­ited at­ten­dees.</p>
    <p>Play­ers who wish to join the events hosted by the or­gan­iser typ­i­cally pay a fee to cover the cost of book­ing, equip­ment, and/or to se­cure their place in the ses­sion.</p>
    <p>The cost of join­ing varies across dif­fer­ent sports and time slots.</p>
    <p>Meetup is not re­stricted only to sports. It is also used for a wide range of life­style in­ter­ests, from mu­sic to tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>ROVO</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore-based Rovo, which started in 2016 as an app for ten­nis play­ers, now al­lows its ap­prox­i­mately 300,000 users to join and host other sports and fit­ness ac­tiv­i­ties for free, in­clud­ing foot­ball, bad­minton and yoga.</p>
    <p>There are more than 30,000 users here, with its three most pop­u­lar sports be­ing ten­nis, bad­minton and foot­ball.</p>
    <p>The app has also fa­cil­i­tated over 150,000 ac­tiv­i­ties – such as play­ing a game that was matched on Rovo or book­ing a fa­cil­ity through the app – in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The app is free to use, with a pre­mium sub­scrip­tion, which al­lows sub­scribers ac­cess to ad­di­tional fea­tures and ben­e­fits, priced at $2.90 a week.</p>
    <p>STRANGER SOC­CER</p>
    <p>This Sin­ga­pore-based app al­lows users to join or or­gan­ise foot­ball games, book a pitch or find an op­pos­ing team.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to its web­site, the fee for join­ing a game starts from $14.40 while book­ing a friendly match, which will see users be­ing matched with op­po­nents and pro­vided with a pitch and ref­eree, can cost more than $100.</p>
