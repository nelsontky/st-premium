    <p>We thank Mr Loh Boon Seah for shar­ing his ex­pe­ri­ence with his el­derly neigh­bour and his son (Neigh­bours tried to help vul­ner­a­ble fam­ily, but they re­fused help; Dec 9) and for his con­cern for his neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>The fa­ther and son are known to the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment’s (MSF) So­cial</p>
    <p>Ser­vice Of­fice (SSO) @ Ang Mo Kio, Ang Mo Kio Fam­ily Ser­vice Cen­tre, as well as other gov­ern­ment, com­mu­nity, grass­roots and health­care part­ners.</p>
    <p>Since Jan­uary last year, the fam­ily ser­vice cen­tre and com­mu­nity part­ners have tried to en­gage the fa­ther and son, who re­peat­edly de­clined help.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the fam­ily in­formed us that they had suf­fi­cient in­come and reg­u­lar ac­cess to med­i­cal treat­ments for age­ing-re­lated ail­ments and phys­io­ther­apy.</p>
    <p>As both fa­ther and son were as­sessed to be able to make their own de­ci­sions, we had to re­spect their wishes.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, the fam­ily ser­vice cen­tre con­tin­ued to keep in touch with the fam­ily and at­tempted to ex­tend as­sis­tance to the fam­ily on mat­ters such as de­clut­ter­ing and care plans.</p>
    <p>When the son died, the fam­ily ser­vice cen­tre also worked with com­mu­nity part­ners to sup­port the fa­ther with funeral ar­range­ments and emo­tional sup­port.</p>
    <p>We en­cour­age mem­bers of the pub­lic to con­tinue keep­ing an eye out for their neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>Those who come across in­di­vid­u­als or fam­i­lies who re­quire sup­port, can con­tact our ComCare hot­line on 1800-222-0000 or ap­proach the near­est SSO (www.msf.gov.sg/ssolo­ca­tor) or Fam­ily Ser­vice Cen­tre (www.msf.gov.sg/fs­clo­ca­tor).</p>
