    <p>De­spite Manch­ester City fin­ish­ing a mas­sive 18 points be­hind Premier League cham­pi­ons Liver­pool last sea­son, Le­ices­ter man­ager Bren­dan Rodgers be­lieves that Pep Guardi­ola’s men can be strong con­tenders this cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Ahead of to­day’s league trip to the Eti­had, Rodgers, a for­mer Liver­pool boss him­self, ex­pects City to be a big­ger threat than last term.</p>
    <p>He said: “Manch­ester City as a team al­ways play to a very, very high level. They have a man­ager who is a real pioneer of our in­dus­try – a won­der­ful coach, and they ob­vi­ously have top-level play­ers as well.</p>
    <p>“For us, it’s the ex­cite­ment of the chal­lenge, play­ing against one of the top teams in Europe. I saw their game against Wolves (3-1 win) and they were out­stand­ing – their in­ten­sity and po­si­tion­ing, and j ust the sheer qual­ity they have.</p>
    <p>“It’s a dif­fi­cult game for us, but another good mea­sure for us.”</p>
    <p>The North­ern Ir­ish­man also high­lighted two of City’s stars, play­maker Kevin de Bruyne and for­ward Ra­heem Ster­ling, who he feels would be vi­tal to their ti­tle chase.</p>
    <p>“It’s very hard to pin­point one,” Rodgers said. “De Bruyne is very im­por­tant to them, but I also look at Ra­heem and what he gives them, that pace, di­rect­ness and in­ten­sity, the fact he can play in a cou­ple of po­si­tions, and the im­prove­ments he has made in goalscor­ing – he’s up i n that world-class bracket for me.</p>
    <p>“For de Bruyne, it’s hard to know a cen­tral mid­field player in world foot­ball who’s bet­ter in terms of his power and his pass­ing… his view of the game is in­cred­i­ble.</p>
    <p>“They are ab­so­lutely sen­sa­tional play­ers that make a dif­fer­ence.”</p>
    <p>Rodgers also con­firmed that Wil­fred Ndidi will be out of ac­tion for up to 12 weeks as he un­der­goes a groin surgery. The Le­ices­ter mid­fielder suf­fered an ab­duc­tor in­jury in last Sun­day’s 4-2 Premier League win over Burn­ley.</p>
    <p>City have a long list of ab­sen­tees them­selves, with Guardi­ola turn­ing to youth for Thurs­day’s 2-1 win over Bournemout­h in the League Cup.</p>
    <p>Ser­gio Aguero, Bernardo Silva, Joao Cancelo and Olek­sandr Zinchenko are all in­jured and Ni­co­las Ota­mendi may also miss out due to a nig­gle.</p>
    <p>Mid­fielder Ilkay Gun­do­gan is self-iso­lat­ing af­ter con­tract­ing Covid-19, while cen­tre-back Aymeric La­porte is doubt­ful, hav­ing re­turned to train­ing only last week fol­low­ing his pos­i­tive test for the virus.</p>
