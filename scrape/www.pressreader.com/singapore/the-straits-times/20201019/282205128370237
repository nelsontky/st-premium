    <p>We re­fer to Work­ers’ Party MP Ja­mus Lim’s com­ment in Par­lia­ment that union lead­ers use “folksy wis­dom and be­liefs” in re­fer­ring to how we jus­tify the pro­gres­sive wage model (WP</p>
    <p>MPs and NTUC deputy chief spar over min­i­mum wage, Oct 16).</p>
    <p>Mr Lim has not stud­ied the ef­forts unions have put in to roll out the pro­gres­sive wage model (PWM) over the years.</p>
    <p>The Union of Se­cu­rity Em­ploy­ees dis­cussed and ne­go­ti­ated for the pri­vate se­cu­rity in­dus­try PWM from 2012 till 2014. We en­gaged the in­dus­try ex­ten­sively, speak­ing to se­cu­rity agen­cies, se­cu­rity of­fi­cers and also ser­vice buy­ers, not the folksy ap­proach Mr Lim im­putes to us.</p>
    <p>The tri­par­tite work group, com­pris­ing the union, em­ployer as­so­ci­a­tions, buy­ers and gov­ern­ment rep­re­sen­ta­tives con­sid­ered all in­put be­fore set­ting out the PWM lad­ders of pro­duc­tiv­ity, skills, ca­reer path and wages.</p>
    <p>For months, the work group stood up to wide­spread crit­i­cism, and even anger, over even con­sid­er­ing a wage reg­u­la­tion for the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Some agency bosses were up­set that they might be put out of busi­ness, while many buy­ers were up­set that they had to pay more. Fac­ing these ob­jec­tions re­quired a strong sense of moral con­vic­tion that we were do­ing some­thing right, cer­tainly not the folksy naivety that Mr Lim ac­cuses us of.</p>
    <p>Due to the PWM, the gross wages of se­cu­rity of­fi­cers have in­creased by around 12 per cent in the last two years, and this steady wage in­crease even sur­passes re­cent me­dian wage growth, and we can­not help but be of­fended by his ac­cu­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>His the­o­ret­i­cal claims sug­gest that he knows of bet­ter ways to help our se­cu­rity of­fi­cers, yet his con­ced­ing in Par­lia­ment a month ago that he did not know what level of min­i­mum wage would be ap­pro­pri­ate for Sin­ga­pore sug­gests a com­plete lack of care­ful con­sid­er­a­tion or study.</p>
    <p>This is sur­pris­ing, given that his party had pro­posed a na­tional min­i­mum take-home wage of $1,300 a month for full-time work, and even added that this could be pro-rated for part-time work. This begs the ques­tion of whether Mr Lim had in­deed care­fully stud­ied the is­sue, if at all.</p>
