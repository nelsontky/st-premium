    <p>From re­al­tors to tele­vi­sion celebritie­s – that is what hap­pened to the cast of Sell­ing Sun­set, the hit Net­flix re­al­ity show which fol­lows a group of agents at Los An­ge­les real es­tate bro­ker­age firm Op­pen­heim Group. Cast mem­bers Amanza Smith (below, right), Mary Fitzger­ald (below, left) and Ro­main Bon­net spoke to regional media in an in­ter­view. Take a look at five facts about the cast.</p>
    <p>From re­al­tors to tele­vi­sion celebritie­s – that is what hap­pened to the cast of Sell­ing Sun­set (2019 to present), the hit Net­flix re­al­ity show which fol­lows a group of agents at Los An­ge­les real es­tate bro­ker­age firm Op­pen­heim Group. The third sea­son pre­miered last month.</p>
    <p>Cast mem­bers Amanza Smith, Mary Fitzger­ald and Ro­main Bon­net spoke to regional media in an in­ter­view or­gan­ised by celebrity video plat­form Ace, where fans can pay to get cus­tomised, per­son­alised short clips from them and other celebritie­s.</p>
    <p>Smith and Fitzger­ald are re­al­tors, while Bon­net is a model and project man­ager in home re­mod­elling. Here are five things to know about the cast.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>THEY DO NOT AL­WAYS KNOW WHAT GOES ON IN THE SE­RIES</p>
    <p>De­spite star­ring in the show, the cast say they still have to watch it to get the full pic­ture of what goes on in the se­ries.</p>
    <p>Bon­net, 27, who is mar­ried to Fitzger­ald, says: “We too want to know ex­actly what hap­pened, be­cause we aren’t al­ways there, so we don’t al­ways know what’s been said.”</p>
    <p>And watch­ing the se­ries can be emo­tional for the cast, too. Fitzger­ald, 40, says: “Parts of it were re­ally hard, (like) when I watched Amanza with her kids and a scene of Chrishell cry­ing,” he says.</p>
    <p>Chrishell Stause, who is also an ac­tress, was mar­ried to Justin Hartley, star of ro­man­tic fam­ily drama This Is Us (2016 to present). They split up last year.</p>
    <p>Smith, 43, is a sin­gle mother rais­ing her daugh­ter Noah, 10, and son Braker, eight, on her own. Their fa­ther is for­mer Amer­i­can foot­ball player Ralph Brown.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>THE DRAMA DOES NOT STOP</p>
    <p>The cast mem­bers have plenty of feuds with one an­other.</p>
    <p>Fitzger­ald, for in­stance, has an icy relationsh­ip with for­mer friend and agent Chris­tine Quinn. They drifted apart over the course of the show.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Bon­net dis­likes his wife’s co-worker Davina Po­tratz and had a ma­jor fight with her in the sec­ond sea­son.</p>
    <p>When asked how the cast could be friendly again, Smith scoffs: “A lo­bot­omy?”</p>
    <p>Bon­net adds: “You have to be hon­est with each other. If you have some­thing to say, you should go to some­one and say it. They can dis­agree, but at least they can’t say you’re dis­hon­est.”</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>BE­ING A RE­AL­TOR IS TOUGH</p>
    <p>Fitzger­ald says: “The show makes our job look so easy, as if you can just jump in and start sell­ing mil­lion-dol­lar homes. But it takes time to build (a clien­tele).”</p>
    <p>Smith, the new­est agent at the bro­ker­age, agrees: “To (get) clients, you need to be out there, be so­cial, go­ing to events. It’s not like I have a Rolodex or re­fer­rals.”</p>
    <p>On his re­mod­elling of homes, Bon­net adds: “The show doesn’t show many scenes of me work­ing. But those crazy, beau­ti­ful houses you see take a lot of time and ef­fort. I’m not sure peo­ple un­der­stand how much work it is.”</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>THEY HAVE CELEBRITY FANS</p>
    <p>The show’s pop­u­lar­ity means the cast have at­tracted at­ten­tion even from big­ger celebritie­s.</p>
    <p>Fitzger­ald and Bon­net say they have heard that ac­tor Jonah Hill, known for roles in films such as The Wolf Of Wall Street (2013) and the 21 Jump Street movies (2012 and 2014), is a fan.</p>
    <p>And Smith was over the moon when she found out that Lena Dun­ham, cre­ator of dram­edy se­ries Girls (2012 to 2017), is also a fan.</p>
    <p>She says: “I loved the show, so when I re­alised that she fol­lowed me on In­sta­gram, I ‘fan­girled’ about it.”</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>THEY ARE NOT THE ONLY GOOD-LOOK­ING RE­AL­TORS</p>
    <p>It may seem un­re­al­is­tic to au­di­ences that all the agents at the Op­pen­heim Group are at­trac­tive and well-groomed – but they live in Los An­ge­les, af­ter all.</p>
    <p>Smith says: “Peo­ple come to LA to pur­sue mod­el­ling or act­ing, so there are good-look­ing peo­ple from other states.</p>
    <p>“When those as­pi­ra­tions don’t work out, a lot of peo­ple go into real es­tate be­cause, well, you also have to be per­son­able and good at mar­ket­ing your­self. So there are a lot of good-look­ing real es­tate agents.”</p>
    <p>• Sell­ing Sun­set is avail­able on Net­flix.</p>
