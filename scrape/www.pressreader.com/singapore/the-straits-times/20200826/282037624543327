    <p>When com­puter sci­ence un­der­grad­u­ate Ooi Jun Sheng’s par­ents’ in­comes took a hit be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic, the 26-year-old stu­dent at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity (NTU) worked part-time to help ease the fi­nan­cial bur­den.</p>
    <p>Af­ter his fa­ther’s work­ing hours and salary as a ware­house as­sis­tant were re­duced and his mother lost her job as a sales as­sis­tant, Mr Ooi worked part-time at NTU’s mer­chan­dise store and helped out with his friend’s on­line flo­ral bou­tique.</p>
    <p>But his fi­nan­cial strain has eased some­what, thanks to NTU’s Covid-19 re­lief pack­age, which has seen more than 1,000 stu­dents re­ceiv­ing fi­nan­cial aid to­talling $1.5 mil­lion, the univer­sity an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The pack­age was first launched in April to pro­vide im­me­di­ate help to stu­dents fac­ing se­ri­ous fi­nan­cial chal­lenges due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The typ­i­cal as­sis­tance pack­age of­fered to stu­dents ranged between $500 and $3,000, de­pend­ing on the needs of the stu­dent, said NTU.</p>
    <p>One of the ini­tia­tives to fund the pack­age was the NTU Pri­or­i­ties Fund, which was also launched in April. It was seeded and launched with a per­sonal gift of $100,000 from NTU pres­i­dent Subra Suresh and his wife Mary.</p>
    <p>The fund has since at­tracted 1,300 other donors who have pledged about $1.5 mil­lion in to­tal.</p>
    <p>Of the more than 1,000 stu­dents who got sup­port from the re­lief pack­age, 400 did so through the fund.</p>
    <p>Re­cip­i­ents of the fund will pledge to “pay it for­ward” within two years of grad­u­a­tion and re­turn the in­ter­est-free cash as­sis­tance to the univer­sity, mak­ing it an ev­er­green fund.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Suresh said: “As a ben­e­fi­ciary of a phil­an­thropic scheme, with­out which I would not have pur­sued post­grad­u­ate ed­u­ca­tion in the United States, I be­lieve strongly in pay­ing it for­ward. With the NTU Pri­or­i­ties Fund, our hope is to not only al­le­vi­ate the fi­nan­cial bur­den of our stu­dents, but also in­spire our ben­e­fi­cia­ries to pay it for­ward, which is the true spirit of this fund.”</p>
    <p>Other ter­tiary in­sti­tu­tions, such as the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS), have launched sim­i­lar funds.</p>
    <p>The NUS Stu­dents Sol­i­dar­ity Fund was launched in April with an ini­tial sum of $220,000 raised from alumni bene­fac­tors. About 700 of NUS’ need­i­est stu­dents re­ceived a one-time grant of $400 in cash.</p>
