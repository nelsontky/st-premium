    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • From In­se­cure’s 20some­thing women to the Mus­lim-Amer­i­can star of Ramy, Sun­day’s Emmy line-up is an un­prece­dented show­case of peo­ple of colour.</p>
    <p>But the Amer­i­can tele­vi­sion in­dus­try needs to take con­crete ac­tion on pledges to nur­ture non­white writ­ers and di­rec­tors to en­sure that the awards cer­e­mony this year is not just a blip trig­gered by a sum­mer of protests over sys­temic racism in the United States, ob­servers say.</p>
    <p>“I’m sure the last thing the Tele­vi­sion Acad­emy wanted was to have an ‘Em­mys so white’ con­tro­versy in the mid­dle of all that,” said Mr Eric Deg­gans, TV critic for Na­tional Pub­lic Ra­dio.</p>
    <p>“So I’m not sur­prised they paid spe­cial at­ten­tion to the work of black per­form­ers,” said Mr Deg­gans, au­thor of the 2012 book, Race Baiter.</p>
    <p>Record Emmy nom­i­na­tions for peo­ple of colour in­cluded nods for Kerry Wash­ing­ton (Lit­tle Fires Ev­ery­where and Amer­i­can Son), San­dra Oh (Killing Eve), Billy Porter (Pose), Regina King (Watch­men), Issa Rae (In­se­cure) and Ster­ling K. Brown (This Is Us and Watch­men).</p>
    <p>Watch­men, the su­per­hero al­ter­na­tive re­al­ity drama in­fused with racial themes, l ed nom­i­na­tions with 26 nods.</p>
    <p>Nom­i­na­tions open doors for other black, Asian and Latino artists and shape per­cep­tions be­yond the world of en­ter­tain­ment, said Mr Rashad Robin­son, pres­i­dent of so­cial jus­tice or­gan­i­sa­tion Colour of Change.</p>
    <p>“What these awards rep­re­sent is the in­dus­try’s way of cre­at­ing a sys­tem of let­ting peo­ple in, of cre­at­ing ac­cess to jobs and op­por­tu­ni­ties,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It dic­tates the stories we get to see in the world about who we are, and that has deep im­pli­ca­tions on the un­writ­ten rules about how we are treated in hos­pi­tals, by judges and at schools.”</p>
    <p>The Emmy nom­i­nees came from shows that were made before the United States be­gan a painful cul­tural reck­on­ing over racism this sum­mer.</p>
    <p>More are on their way, in­clud­ing doc­u­men­tary Driv­ing While Black; Woke, about a black car­toon­ist who has an en­counter with po­lice; abo­li­tion­ist drama The Good Lord Bird; and En­slaved, about the his­tory of the slave trade.</p>
    <p>Mr Robin­son said that ex­cit­ing as it is to see black artists and stories break through, more struc­tural changes such as in­clu­sion riders, di­ver­sity in writ­ers rooms and fully rounded char­ac­ters are needed to en­sure last­ing change.</p>
    <p>“It’s not enough to care. It’s not enough to be aware,” he said. “We have to have peo­ple will­ing to act and to make real changes.” .</p>
    <p>Mr Deg­gans noted that Lat­inx tal­ent is still largely over­looked at the Em­mys, even though Lati­nos form Amer­ica’s sec­ond-largest eth­nic group after whites.</p>
    <p>“It’s re­gret­table that so much of the recog­ni­tion fell on black per­form­ers and there wasn’t a lit­tle bit more in re­gard to Lat­inx peo­ple es­pe­cially,” said Mr Deg­gans, not­ing that shows like Gen­te­fied, Vida and One Day At A Time were largely over­looked.</p>
    <p>“The cause of Lat­inx rep­re­sen­ta­tion in Hol­ly­wood is a lit­tle fur­ther back – where black peo­ple were, say, 10 years ago,” he added.</p>
    <p>The Emmy Awards will be handed out on Sun­day (Mon­day morn­ing, Sin­ga­pore time) at a vir­tual cer­e­mony tele­vised on ABC.</p>
