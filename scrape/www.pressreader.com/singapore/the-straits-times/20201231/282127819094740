    <p>There are years that merely pass, and those that stand as clear mark­ers and pro­vide im­por­tant lessons for cur­rent and fu­ture gen­er­a­tions. That the end of 2020 has ar­rived may be wel­come news to a world weary of how the coro­n­avirus pan­demic se­verely af­fected so­ci­etal and eco­nomic norms and con­ven­tions, im­pact­ing jobs, re­la­tion­ships, busi­nesses and en­deav­ours. It up­ended the sense of well-be­ing and se­cu­rity, the work­ings of a mar­ket econ­omy and the many plans that in­di­vid­u­als and so­ci­eties made based on their expectatio­ns and known facts.</p>
    <p>More than 1.7 mil­lion peo­ple have died and the dis­as­ter on the eco­nomic front is no less pro­nounced. Ac­cord­ing to a KPMG re­port, the pan­demic forced un­palat­able pol­icy choices on govern­ments. At one end, the choice lay in min­imis­ing the eco­nomic dam­age of Covid-19 by al­low­ing the virus to go through the pop­u­la­tion rel­a­tively unchecked, thereby cre­at­ing stress on health­care sys­tems. At the other end, the so­lu­tion lay in adopt­ing an en­gi­neered slow­down of the econ­omy to man­age health risks. That ap­proach, which has been adopted gen­er­ally, called for the clos­ing of bor­ders, the in­tro­duc­tion of quar­an­tines, wear­ing of masks and so­cial dis­tanc­ing, among a host of mea­sures. Con­se­quently, the pan­demic trig­gered the deep­est eco­nomic re­ces­sion in nearly a century. The Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity notes that travel re­stric­tions have led to plung­ing for­tunes for the avi­a­tion and hos­pi­tal­ity in­dus­tries even as lock­downs glob­ally also bat­tered the now slowly re­cov­er­ing re­tail and food and bev­er­age sec­tor. Even so, such pro­tec­tive mea­sures have re­sulted in his­tor­i­cally high un­em­ploy­ment fig­ures. A health cri­sis de­stroyed the cal­cu­lus of sup­ply and de­mand in a way that was un­ex­pected and bru­tal.</p>
    <p>Yet, even as 2020 passes, it forms a bench­mark for global so­ci­ety. What is re­mark­able is how govern­ments em­barked on bold ame­lio­ra­tive mea­sures to pro­tect jobs and keep eco­nomic in­ter­ac­tions go­ing. They have done so with vary­ing de­grees of suc­cess, but the ef­fort un­der­lines not only the state’s vi­tal role in the eco­nomic life of na­tions, par­tic­u­larly in times of ex­is­ten­tial cri­sis, but also the im­por­tance of mul­ti­lat­eral co­op­er­a­tion among coun­tries and their in­sti­tu­tions. This re­mains crit­i­cal now that vac­cines are avail­able. Sup­ply chains, data and in­for­ma­tion shar­ing will be vi­tal to restor­ing the health of na­tions.</p>
    <p>Or­di­nary peo­ple, too, have played their part and must con­tinue to do so. Groups have sprung up spon­ta­neously to help those most in need. This de­vel­op­ment at­tests to the wel­come growth of civil so­ci­ety. No mat­ter how bad 2020 has been, it pro­vides valu­able lessons in the hu­man ca­pac­ity for re­silience. Most so­ci­eties will be glad to see the end of 2020, but re­cov­er­ing in the next year is not go­ing to be any less chal­leng­ing.</p>
