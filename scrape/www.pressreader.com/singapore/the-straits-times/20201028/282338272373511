    <p>• Fifa pres­i­dent Gianni In­fantino has con­tracted the coro­n­avirus, world foot­ball’s gov­ern­ing body con­firmed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The 50-year-old has mild symp­toms and will re­main in iso­la­tion for 10 days.</p>
    <p>“All peo­ple who came into con­tact with the Fifa pres­i­dent dur­ing the last few days have been in­formed ac­cord­ingly and they are be­ing re­quested to take the nec­es­sary steps,” it said.</p>
    <p>“Fifa sin­cerely wishes pres­i­dent In­fantino a speedy re­cov­ery.”</p>
    <p>In­fantino’s last pub­lic ap­pear­ance was at Fifa’s Com­pli­ance Sum­mit, which ended on Oct 16 when all at­ten­dees were present via video call.</p>
    <p>The Swiss-Ital­ian has con­tin­ued to travel amid the pan­demic, at­tend­ing a sign­ing cer­e­mony at the White House last month to mark nor­malised re­la­tions be­tween Is­rael, the United Arab Emi­rates and Bahrain.</p>
    <p>Cases, hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions and deaths from Covid-19 in Switzer­land, where Fifa is based, have dou­bled from one week to the next through­out this month.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s gov­ern­ment is ex­pected to de­cide to­day on new mea­sures to con­trol the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has also con­tin­ued to wreak havoc across the sport­ing land­scape, with fears of an out­break at Lazio.</p>
    <p>The Ital­ian Serie A side are due to travel to Bel­gian out­fit Club Brugge to­day for their Cham­pi­ons League Group F game, but ac­cord­ing to Ital­ian me­dia site Tut­tomer­ca­toweb, coach Si­mone In­za­ghi has been left with a thread­bare squad.</p>
    <p>Just 12 play­ers trained on the eve of their game af­ter Covid-19 tests were con­ducted on Mon­day, with the likes of Euro­pean Golden Shoe win­ner Ciro Im­mo­bile ab­sent.</p>
