    <p>• Hong Kong’s econ­omy just can­not catch a break.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing briefly shown signs of re­cov­ery in re­cent months from its deep­est re­ces­sion on record, the Asian fi­nan­cial hub is brac­ing it­self for its stiffest test yet as a resur­gent virus com­bines with an in­creas­ingly un­cer­tain po­lit­i­cal and fi­nan­cial out­look.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong is fac­ing fun­da­men­tal ques­tions about its long-term role as an in­ter­na­tional fi­nance cen­tre, amid signs that tech­nol­ogy firms are aban­don­ing the city and global com­pa­nies are spurn­ing its on­ce­vaunted le­gal sys­tem af­ter im­po­si­tion of a na­tional se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>While that is hap­pen­ing, the more im­me­di­ate prospects for growth are de­te­ri­o­rat­ing by the day as the coro­n­avirus case count spikes.</p>
    <p>“There is no light at the end of the tun­nel; we have writ­ten off any pos­si­ble chance of prof­its for the rest of the year,” said Mr Dou­glas Young, co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of life­style and fash­ion re­tail chain Goods of De­sire.</p>
    <p>“In the long term, I am op­ti­mistic that we shall get over this cri­sis, but our lives will be dif­fer­ent.”</p>
    <p>Hong Kong will have an up­date on Wed­nes­day on where things stand when the gov­ern­ment re­ports sec­ond-quar­ter eco­nomic growth fig­ures. Econ­o­mists fore­cast an 8.7 per cent con­trac­tion from year-ago lev­els, al­most equalling the record 8.9 per cent de­cline posted in the first quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The city re­ported 123 new in­fec­tions yes­ter­day, a new daily record, bring­ing the to­tal tally to 2,372, with 16 deaths.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s sud­den spike in coro­n­avirus cases may have stemmed from its will­ing­ness to let sea­far­ers skip quar­an­tine while chang­ing ships in the city, a lead­ing health ex­pert said. Most of the new cases were lo­cally trans­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>Some health ex­perts have blamed an ex­emp­tion from the usual 14-day quar­an­tine which the gov­ern­ment granted to “es­sen­tial per­son­nel”, in­clud­ing cross-bound­ary truck­ers, air crew and sea crew. But of­fi­cials have said the ar­range­ment was nec­es­sary, while in­sist­ing it was a “mis­un­der­stand­ing” that the new wave was at­trib­ut­able to the ex­emp­tion.</p>
    <p>Af­ter analysing virus sam­ples from re­cent con­firmed cases, Pro­fes­sor Gabriel Le­ung, dean of the Univer­sity of Hong Kong’s med­i­cal school, said on Thurs­day that the virus’ resur­gence most likely stemmed from such im­ported cases.</p>
    <p>He said the wave was “prob­a­bly be­cause of the mul­ti­ple im­ported (cases); it could be the crew mem­bers or sailors ex­empted from quar­an­tine”.</p>
    <p>“When they en­tered Hong Kong, there were no im­me­di­ate quar­an­tine mea­sures or test­ing ar­range­ments. You could imag­ine, some of the crew mem­bers, the ho­tel they stay in, maybe, is down­town,” Prof Le­ung said.</p>
    <p>He added that with the re­lax­ation of so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures last month, small restau­rants had be­come high-risk venues, es­pe­cially those fre­quented by taxi drivers.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has ex­tended civil ser­vants’ work-from-home plan for an­other week, to Aug 2, ac­cord­ing to a state­ment on its web­site. While urg­ing res­i­dents to stay at home, Hong Kong’s gov­ern­ment as yet has not man­dated a full lock­down.</p>
    <p>Empty store­fronts are be­com­ing a com­mon scene in the city’s shop­ping dis­tricts, where a lit­tle more than a year ago, they were packed with tourists.</p>
    <p>Cause­way Bay on Hong Kong Is­land had a va­cancy rate of 7.9 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter, com­pared with zero a year ear­lier, while Mong Kok in Kowloon has a va­cancy rate of 24 per cent, quadru­ple that of a year ago, ac­cord­ing to prop­erty bro­ker Cush­man & Wake­field.</p>
    <p>“I am not feel­ing op­ti­mistic about the out­look for the city be­cause there are lots of un­cer­tain­ties,” said Mr Tommy Wu, se­nior econ­o­mist with Ox­ford Eco­nom­ics in Hong Kong. He fore­casts a 9.5 per cent con­trac­tion year on year in the sec­ond quar­ter, and a 6 per cent de­cline in gross do­mes­tic prod­uct for this year.</p>
    <p>“If the third wave of virus in­fec­tions prolongs, I would expect a much greater wave of busi­ness clo­sures in the com­ing months,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Samy Red­jeb, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of lux­ury brands dis­trib­u­tor The Bluebell Group, said: “The only pos­i­tive of Hong Kong was the pan­demic was un­der con­trol un­til the end of June, when sales picked up slightly, and now that is gone.</p>
    <p>“Bor­ders are not re­open­ing soon, and af­ter a year of down­trend, and the con­stant battle on rents, many re­tail­ers are fac­ing dif­fi­cult ques­tions as to their fu­ture in the city. It is ex­tremely sad.”</p>
