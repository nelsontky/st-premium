    <p>Jakarta’s Wisma At­let, an ath­letes’ res­i­dence, has been con­verted into a hos­pi­tal for Covid-19 pa­tients, as main hos­pi­tals in the In­done­sian cap­i­tal have reported full oc­cu­pancy. In­done­sia Covid-19 spokesman Wiku Adis­as­mito said ear­lier this month that Jakarta’s 67 Covid-19 re­fer­ral hos­pi­tals had an oc­cu­pancy rate of 77 per cent, with 69 per cent of in­ten­sive care unit beds al­ready oc­cu­pied.</p>
    <p>Main hos­pi­tals in the In­done­sian cap­i­tal Jakarta have reported full oc­cu­pancy, with some hav­ing a wait­ing list of up to 20 con­firmed Covid-19 pa­tients seek­ing treat­ment, as cases con­tinue to surge in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>To ease the pres­sure on the hos­pi­tals in the city of more than 10 mil­lion, the gov­ern­ment is mak­ing more rooms avail­able at Jakarta’s Wisma At­let, an ath­letes’ res­i­dence con­verted into a hos­pi­tal for coro­n­avirus pa­tients with mild symp­toms.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment is also set to tap three-star ho­tels in the cap­i­tal as cen­tralised quar­an­tine cen­tres for asymp­to­matic pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The cap­i­tal has 190 hos­pi­tals, ac­cord­ing to Jakarta Gov­er­nor Anies Baswedan.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, the coun­try’s Covid-19 spokesman Wiku Adis­as­mito said Jakarta’s 67 Covid-19 re­fer­ral hos­pi­tals had an oc­cu­pancy rate of 77 per cent, with 69 per cent of in­ten­sive care unit beds al­ready oc­cu­pied.</p>
    <p>Six Covid-19 des­ig­nated hos­pi­tals con­tacted by The Straits Times on Sun­day and Mon­day said the num­bers of in­pa­tients have spiked, espe­cially since last month.</p>
    <p>The city-run Pasar Minggu Hos­pi­tal had 20 coro­n­avirus-con­firmed pa­tients wait­ing for a bed on Satur­day, ac­cord­ing to the hos­pi­tal man­age­ment. It said that all 220 beds were oc­cu­pied, with the hos­pi­tal pre­par­ing 80 more beds for Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>At the state-owned Per­tam­ina hos­pi­tal in the Ke­bay­oran Baru area, 13 con­firmed pa­tients were on the wait­ing list on Mon­day, with more than 300 beds al­ready oc­cu­pied. Mean­while, the Medis­tra pri­vate hos­pi­tal in the city cen­tre has been running at full ca­pac­ity for about two weeks.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that pa­tient turnover at pub­lic hos­pi­tals is lower than at pri­vate hos­pi­tals, with pub­lic hos­pi­tal man­age­ment al­low­ing those with coro­n­avirus to re­main in hos­pi­tal for longer pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>This is de­spite the pa­tients show­ing signs of re­cov­ery. Crit­ics say the re­sult is that those who need ur­gent treat­ment are be­ing de­prived of care in pub­lic hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>At pri­vate hos­pi­tals, there is an in­cen­tive for the man­age­ment to dis­charge re­cov­er­ing pa­tients in a more timely man­ner.</p>
    <p>These hos­pi­tals are re­im­bursed by the gov­ern­ment based on the num­ber of in­pa­tients the pri­vate hos­pi­tals have seen, re­gard­less of their length of stay.</p>
    <p>A check on Mon­day with two pri­vate hos­pi­tals in Jakarta – Pon­dok In­dah and MMC – and the gov­ern­ment-run Su­lianti Saroso In­fec­tious Dis­eases Hos­pi­tal showed all were running at full ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia has recorded 252,923 con­firmed Covid-19 cases, of which 64,554 were from Jakarta, as at yes­ter­day. The num­ber of deaths to­talled 9,837 na­tion­wide.</p>
    <p>But the gov­ern­ment has re­peat­edly guar­an­teed it has the ca­pac­ity to treat all coro­n­avirus pa­tients, of­fer­ing the Wisma At­let op­tion for those with mild symp­toms.</p>
    <p>Hos­pi­tals con­tacted by The</p>
    <p>Straits Times say they have been re­fer­ring asymp­to­matic pa­tients and those with mild to mod­er­ate symp­toms to Wisma At­let, which is not as well-equipped as hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>The ath­letes’ vil­lage has 10 tow­ers, with four be­ing used to treat Covid-19 pa­tients. On Mon­day, the newly con­verted fourth tower, which has a 1,500-bed ca­pac­ity, started to take in asymp­to­matic pa­tients and those with mild symp­toms.</p>
    <p>An­other tower in the vil­lage is be­ing used for the same kind of pa­tients, while the two re­main­ing tow­ers are for those with mild to mod­er­ate symp­toms.</p>
    <p>Each tower can ac­com­mo­date be­tween 1,300 and 1,500 beds.</p>
    <p>Wisma At­let was opened for coro­n­avirus pa­tients in March with 3,000 beds, but its ca­pac­ity can be ex­panded to hold 24,000 beds in to­tal.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia is shift­ing from home iso­la­tion to a cen­tralised-quar­an­tine sys­tem to deal with asymp­to­matic per­sons, af­ter the coun­try noted an in­creas­ing num­ber of trans­mis­sions among fam­ily mem­bers and neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers es­ti­mate that be­tween 30 per cent and 40 per cent of all in­fected in­di­vid­u­als in In­done­sia may show no symp­toms.</p>
