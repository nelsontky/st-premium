    <p>Last year, about a month af­ter ar­riv­ing in Aus­tralia, Mr Ter Guo Qian, 24, had to leave his job at a bak­ery in Syd­ney as the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion started wors­en­ing.</p>
    <p>In March, when he came back to Singapore just be­fore bor­ders closed, he found it hard to land a job.</p>
    <p>He de­cided to pur­sue his dream of open­ing a bak­ery-cum-cafe in Ko­van.</p>
    <p>“There’ll never be a time when I’ll say I’m ready to start a busi­ness. I was tak­ing a leap of faith,” says Mr Ter, who was di­ag­nosed with a rare can­cer of the thy­mus, an or­gan in the chest that is part of the lym­phatic sys­tem, when he was 18.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a year spent un­der­go­ing surgery and chemo­ther­apy, he opted not to fin­ish his poly­tech­nic IT course, but to pur­sue a diploma at hos­pi­tal­ity in­sti­tute Shatec in­stead, fo­cus­ing on bak­ing, which he picked up while he was re­cov­er­ing.</p>
    <p>Since then, he has worked at a lo­cal bak­ery and taken bak­ing cour­ses in Thai­land and the United States.</p>
    <p>De­spite his reser­va­tions as to whether start­ing a busi­ness in a re­ces­sion was a good idea, his par­ents were sup­port­ive.</p>
    <p>His mother Cindy Tan, 52, who runs a travel agency, says: “When</p>
    <p>Guo Qian came back and couldn’t find a job, I told him, since you are so pas­sion­ate about this, now is the best time to launch your busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>Since her busi­ness has flat-lined with leisure travel cur­tailed, she had more time to help her son start oper­a­tions for The Bread Rack, which spe­cialises in baked goods like sourdough bread and crois­sants.</p>
    <p>It will open of­fi­cially on Jan 21, and some of its prof­its will be do­nated to can­cer pa­tients.</p>
    <p>She and her 57-year-old hus­band, a re­tired en­gi­neer and can­cer sur­vivor, forked out the cap­i­tal, but she de­clines to dis­close the sum. The cou­ple also have a younger son and daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>It has been a bumpy road to open­ing The Bread Rack.</p>
    <p>Lo­gis­ti­cal is­sues caused by the pan­demic meant ship­ments of equip­ment and in­gre­di­ents were de­layed.</p>
    <p>Curbs on move­ment of for­eign labour last year meant ren­o­va­tion was de­layed. A sub-con­trac­tor dis­ap­peared with­out com­plet­ing work late last year.</p>
    <p>De­spite th­ese set­backs, Mr Ter is rar­ing to make The Bread Rack a suc­cess.</p>
    <p>He says: “We’ve i nvested so much time and money. It wouldn’t be nice to dis­ap­point my par­ents.”</p>
