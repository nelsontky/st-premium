    <p>•</p>
    <p>The raid alone was brazen enough. A team of Is­raeli com­man­dos with high-pow­ered torches blasted their way into the vault of a heav­ily guarded ware­house deep in Iran and made off be­fore dawn with 5,000 pages of top-se­cret pa­pers on the coun­try’s nu­clear pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Then in a TV broad­cast a few weeks later, in April 2018, Is­raeli Prime Min­is­ter Ben­jamin Ne­tanyahu cited the con­tents of the pil­fered doc­u­ments and coyly hinted at equally bold op­er­a­tions still to come. “Re­mem­ber that name,” he said, sin­gling out sci­en­tist Mohsen Fakhrizade­h as the cap­tain of Iran’s covert at­tempts to as­sem­ble a nu­clear weapon.</p>
    <p>Now Dr Fakhrizade­h has be­come the lat­est ca­su­alty in a cam­paign of au­da­cious covert at­tacks seem­ingly de­signed to tor­ment Ira­nian lead­ers with re­minders of their weak­ness.</p>
    <p>The op­er­a­tions are con­fronting Iran with an ag­o­nis­ing choice be­tween em­brac­ing the de­mands of hard­lin­ers for swift re­tal­i­a­tion, or at­tempt­ing to make a fresh start with the less im­pla­ca­bly hos­tile ad­min­is­tra­tion of United States Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Dr Fakhrizade­h’s killing was the lat­est in a decade-long pat­tern of mys­te­ri­ous poi­son­ings, car bomb­ings, shoot­ings, thefts and sab­o­tage that has af­flicted the Is­lamic Repub­lic. Most have hit largely anony­mous sci­en­tists or se­cre­tive fa­cil­i­ties said to be linked to its nu­clear pro­gramme, and al­most all have been at­trib­uted by US and Ira­nian of­fi­cials to Iran’s great neme­sis, Is­rael, whose of­fi­cials – with­out for­mally ac­knowl­edg­ing re­spon­si­bil­ity – have all but openly gloated over the re­peated suc­cess of their spies.</p>
    <p>Sel­dom has any coun­try demon­strated a sim­i­lar abil­ity to strike with ap­par­ent im­punity in­side the ter­ri­tory of its fiercest enemy, said Brook­ings In­sti­tu­tion re­searcher Bruce Riedel, a for­mer Cen­tral In­tel­li­gence Agency of­fi­cial with ex­pe­ri­ence in Is­rael. “It’s un­prece­dented,” he said. “And it shows no sign of be­ing ef­fec­tively coun­tered by the Ira­ni­ans.”</p>
    <p>With the killing of their top nu­clear sci­en­tist, the as­sas­si­na­tion of Gen­eral Qasem Soleimani by a US drone strike in Jan­uary and an Is­raeli hit team’s fa­tal shoot­ing of a se­nior Al-Qaeda leader in</p>
    <p>Teheran in Au­gust, Ira­ni­ans are now grap­pling with a new sense of vul­ner­a­bil­ity and de­mands to purge sus­pected col­lab­o­ra­tors. Most of all, they are de­bat­ing how to re­spond at a del­i­cate mo­ment.</p>
    <p>Iran has en­dured years of dev­as­tat­ing eco­nomic sanc­tions un­der a cam­paign of “max­i­mum pres­sure” from Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, and many Ira­nian lead­ers are des­per­ately hop­ing for some mea­sure of re­lief.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has pledged to seek to re­vive a lapsed agree­ment that lifted sanc­tions in ex­change for a halt to nu­clear re­search that might pro­duce a weapon.</p>
