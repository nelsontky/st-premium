    <p>TOKYO • While scant on de­tail, Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga’s state­ment of in­tent to achieve net-zero green­house gas emis­sions by</p>
    <p>2050 has been hailed by green ac­tivists, pro­gres­sive busi­nesses and the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Vow­ing to build a “vir­tu­ous cy­cle of en­vi­ron­ment and eco­nomic growth”, Mr Suga said in his de­but pol­icy speech to the Diet on Mon­day: “Re­spond­ing to cli­mate change should no longer be seen as a con­straint on eco­nomic growth.”</p>
    <p>Dr Takeshi Ku­ramochi, a cli­mate pol­icy re­searcher at the New Cli­mate In­sti­tute in Ger­many, told The Straits Times that be­hind the pledge is a recog­ni­tion that coal en­ergy, which Ja­pan has long held firmly on to, is fast los­ing its com­pet­i­tive­ness to re­new­able en­ergy or low-car­bon al­ter­na­tives such as hy­dro­gen.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that Ja­pan is still build­ing coal plants do­mes­ti­cally, he added: “To achieve the net-zero emis­sions tar­get by 2050, Ja­pan needs to at least do­mes­ti­cally go well be­yond what has been com­mit­ted and ad­vanced so far.”</p>
    <p>He noted that Mr Suga’s pledge had likely been in­flu­enced by China’s com­mit­ment. The world’s largest emit­ter of green­house gases last month vowed to achieve car­bon neu­tral­ity by 2060.</p>
    <p>“That would have re­ally trig­gered Ja­pan to do more – or at least strive for higher am­bi­tions – be­cause Ja­pan can­not af­ford to have a longer time­line than China,” said Dr Ku­ramochi.</p>
    <p>The push comes amid in­ter­na­tional pres­sure for Ja­pan, the world’s fifth-largest car­bon emit­ter, to make a more ex­plicit com­mit­ment to fight global warm­ing, above and be­yond its luke­warm pledges thus far. It was twice awarded the satir­i­cal “Fos­sil Award” at the COP25 cli­mate change con­fer­ence in Madrid last year for its re­fusal to give up coal.</p>
    <p>China’s For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian wel­comed Ja­pan’s pledge, say­ing: “Cli­mate change is a ma­jor chal­lenge fac­ing all mankind. We must ad­here to mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism, gather the strength of all coun­tries and work to­gether to deal with it.”</p>
    <p>United Na­tions Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral An­to­nio Guter­res said he has “no doubt that Ja­pan has all the nec­es­sary tech­no­log­i­cal, fi­nan­cial and en­gi­neer­ing tools to get to net-zero emis­sions by 2050”.</p>
    <p>He is also con­fi­dent that Ja­pan will as­sist de­vel­op­ing coun­tries to reach the same ob­jec­tive.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga’s pledge marks a sig­nif­i­cant shift from Ja­pan’s pre­vi­ous goal to achieve an 80 per cent re­duc­tion in green­house gas emis­sions by 2050. He cited in­no­va­tions such as next-gen­er­a­tion so­lar cells and car­bon re­cy­cling to help Ja­pan reach the goal.</p>
    <p>The na­tional push comes as some sec­tors, in­clud­ing au­to­mo­tive and steel, have lagged be­hind their in­ter­na­tional peers in de­vel­op­ing en­vi­ron­men­tally friendly poli­cies.</p>
    <p>“This stronger com­mit­ment to reach car­bon neu­tral­ity will of­fer Ja­pan’s al­ter­na­tively fu­elled ve­hi­cle seg­ment – elec­tric and hy­dro­gen-pow­ered ve­hi­cles – a sig­nif­i­cant boost over the com­ing years, es­pe­cially as Ja­pan is lag­ging be­hind other Asian peers, such as China, Hong Kong, Sin­ga­pore and South Korea,” Fitch So­lu­tions said in a re­search note.</p>
    <p>Still, many Ja­panese firms have al­ready been in­vest­ing in green tech­nol­ogy. Mit­subishi Elec­tric opened a net zero-en­ergy build­ing at its re­search and de­vel­op­ment fa­cil­ity in Ka­makura this month. Ja­pan’s largest air­line ANA has signed up for jet fuel made from re­new­able ma­te­ri­als in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga’s pledge was also wel­comed by the Ja­pan Cli­mate Lead­ers Part­ner­ship, a coali­tion of more than 150 com­pa­nies in­clud­ing tech gi­ant Fu­jitsu, food man­u­fac­turer Kikko­man, real es­tate de­vel­oper Mit­sui Fu­dosan, depart­ment store Takashimay­a and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firm Takeda.</p>
    <p>The coali­tion said Ja­panese ad­vanced tech­no­log­i­cal de­vel­op­ment puts it in good stead to build a de­car­bonised so­ci­ety that can “not only help avert cli­mate cri­sis but also re­vi­talise the coun­try’s econ­omy and strengthen (its) in­ter­na­tional com­pet­i­tive­ness”.</p>
    <p>It warned that Ja­panese com­pa­nies face the risk of be­ing shut out from global sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>“Global gi­ant com­pa­nies are in­creas­ingly de­mand­ing their sup­pli­ers to com­ply with their net-zero emis­sions pol­icy and source their elec­tric­ity from 100 per cent re­new­ables,” it said. “There are also in­creas­ing risks for Ja­pan to lose com­pet­i­tive­ness to host busi­nesses.”</p>
    <p>It called on the gov­ern­ment to re­move its cap on the in­vest­ment of new en­ergy re­sources – la­belled the “na­tional bur­den” and com­pris­ing costs to man­age grid sta­bil­ity – so as to pro­mote economies of scale for re­new­able en­ergy sources.</p>
    <p>With coal power plants still un­der con­struc­tion even as in­ef­fi­cient old plants are be­ing phased out, the group also urged the gov­ern­ment to fully de­car­bonise and de­velop a new en­ergy mix “with­out fac­tor­ing in new coal power ca­pac­ity”.</p>
    <p>“The Ja­panese gov­ern­ment has been im­ple­ment­ing mea­sures to ex­pand the use of re­new­ables, while putting in place other poli­cies that ac­tu­ally hin­der the ex­pan­sion of re­new­able en­ergy. This is like step­ping on the ac­cel­er­a­tor and the brakes at the same time,” it said.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan had also said in July that it would stop the fund­ing and sup­port of new coal-fired power plants abroad in prin­ci­ple, but said ex­cep­tions in­clude such sit­u­a­tions as when the plants are be­ing built in de­vel­op­ing na­tions where cheap coal is the only op­tion.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion also does not ap­ply to plants that are al­ready be­ing planned, and non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tions like Green­peace have crit­i­cised the de­ci­sion as fall­ing short.</p>
    <p>Mr Eric Ped­er­sen, head of re­spon­si­ble in­vest­ment at Nordea As­set Man­age­ment, said: “Ja­pan will need to start de­com­mis­sion­ing coal power, and as an ab­so­lute min­i­mum, Ja­panese com­pa­nies must stop build­ing and fi­nanc­ing new coal power abroad. The Vung Ang 2 pro­ject in</p>
    <p>Viet­nam is a case in point.”</p>
    <p>The na­tional push comes as some sec­tors, in­clud­ing au­to­mo­tive and steel, have lagged be­hind their in­ter­na­tional peers in de­vel­op­ing en­vi­ron­men­tally friendly poli­cies.</p>
