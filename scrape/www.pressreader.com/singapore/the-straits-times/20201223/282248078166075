    <p>In a des­per­ate bid to save costs on di­vorce pro­ceed­ings, a man lied be­fore a court that his newly-wed wife had re­fused to con­sum­mate their mar­riage. He did this so that they could an­nul their mar­riage in­stead.</p>
    <p>Daryl Lim Chun Leng, 25, also wanted to avoid be­ing la­belled a di­vorced man, and he asked his then wife to agree to his plan.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Lim was sen­tenced to one week’s jail af­ter he pleaded guilty to one charge of ly­ing be­fore a court of jus­tice.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Lim and Ms Wang Kechen, 24, were mar­ried in Jan­uary 2017 but had mar­i­tal trou­bles by mid-June that year, af­ter Ms Wang dis­cov­ered he had an ex­tra­mar­i­tal af­fair.</p>
    <p>Lim pro­posed an an­nul­ment, which he said was a “bet­ter” op­tion, as the cost of the pro­ceed­ings was lower and both could avoid be­ing la­belled as di­vorcees, court doc­u­ments said.</p>
    <p>An an­nul­ment would also “void the mar­riage im­me­di­ately”, and Lim promised to help Ms Wang in all her fu­ture re­quests.</p>
    <p>Lim then en­gaged a law firm to com­mence pro­ceed­ings, on the ba­sis that Ms Wang had “wil­fully re­fused” to con­sum­mate their mar­riage, said court doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>But their lies were sub­se­quently un­cov­ered. They were dis­cov­ered to have had sex with each other between Jan­uary and July 2017. In­ves­ti­ga­tions showed Lim had con­tin­ued to have sex with Ms Wang in Au­gust and Oc­to­ber be­fore the an­nul­ment was fi­nalised in Novem­ber 2017.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments did not state how the pair were found out.</p>
