    <p>It was their son’s de­gen­er­a­tive eye dis­ease that set oph­thal­mol­o­gist Au­drey Looi and her neu­ro­sur­geon hus­band Ang Beng Ti on the path of phi­lan­thropy.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple were dev­as­tated around a decade ago to find out that James, now 19, suf­fers from Star­gardt’s dis­ease, which causes pro­gres­sive vi­sion loss, when he was in pri­mary school.</p>
    <p>To make mat­ters worse, there was a se­ri­ous lack of pro­grammes then to sup­port chil­dren with low vi­sion in their ed­u­ca­tional and other needs, Dr Ang, 51, said.</p>
    <p>In 2011, the cou­ple set up the char­ity i C2 PrepHouse, which teaches chil­dren with low vi­sion the skills to cope with daily life and sup­ports them to re­main in main­stream schools.</p>
    <p>They now plan to leave $200,000 or more in their will to set up an en­dow­ment fund to sup­port the iC2 PrepHouse’s work and to fund schol­ar­ships for needy un­der­grad­u­ates of the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity (SMU).</p>
    <p>James is now a busi­ness un­der­grad­u­ate at SMU. The Angs have two other chil­dren, aged 13 and 21.</p>
    <p>Dr Looi, 50, said: “So in­stead of giv­ing it (our wealth) all to our chil­dren, we have started think­ing about putting aside a part of it for char­ity. I think we have to be a lit­tle less self­fo­cused and give back to so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>“We told our chil­dren they can con­trib­ute to the fund (in fu­ture). And I would like to think that our kids can man­age with­out this sum we are giv­ing to char­ity. Long af­ter we are gone, we have this char­ity that con­tin­ues to pro­vide help for chil­dren with low vi­sion. iC2 PrepHouse is our fam­ily le­gacy.”</p>
    <p>The cou­ple are among the donors fronting the “A Greater Gift” cam­paign in a three-month drive to pro­mote le­gacy giv­ing that was launched on Tues­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>The cam­paign was started by the Com­mu­nity Foun­da­tion of Sin­ga­pore (CFS), a char­ity which pro­motes phi­lan­thropy here.</p>
    <p>Le­gacy giv­ing is broadly de­fined as fu­ture do­na­tions to char­ity, such as in the form of leav­ing money or prop­erty to char­i­ta­ble causes af­ter one’s death.</p>
    <p>Ms Cather­ine Loh, chief ex­ec­u­tive of CFS, said the char­ity has seen more in­ter­est in le­gacy giv­ing in the past few years from peo­ple of dif­fer­ent de­mo­graphic groups, in­clud­ing sin­gles and mar­ried cou­ples with­out chil­dren.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she added that Sin­ga­pore­ans’ in­ter­est in le­gacy giv­ing lags be­hind that in West­ern so­ci­eties, not­ing that it is taboo in Asian cul­tures to talk about death and even writ­ing wills. But it is chang­ing though.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple think le­gacy giv­ing is only for the very rich. But we want to tell peo­ple, noth­ing is too small. “Another thing peo­ple think is that if they give a le­gacy gift, their chil­dren will not have any­thing. We want to say it’s not an ei­ther-or (sit­u­a­tion) and they can con­sider leav­ing a part of it (their wealth) to char­ity,” added Ms Loh.</p>
    <p>While there are the uber rich who are leav­ing mil­lions to char­ity af­ter their death, some char­i­ties have also re­ceived as lit­tle as $10,000 from a per­son’s es­tate, she said.</p>
    <p>CFS will pro­vide re­sources to help char­i­ties en­gage their donors on le­gacy giv­ing, as part of its ef­forts to boost this form of phi­lan­thropy here.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the Angs, the other donors who are part of the cam­paign in­clude Mem­ber of Par­lia­ment and lawyer Na­dia Ah­mad Samdin, 30, and ven­ture cap­i­tal­ist Hian Goh, 46.</p>
    <p>In their cam­paign video, Ms Na­dia said she went to school with the help of fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance and now wants to help at-risk youth, while Mr Goh wants to cre­ate op­por­tu­ni­ties for in­no­va­tors to reach their full po­ten­tial.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh is a co-founder of the Asian Food Chan­nel, a pay-tele­vi­sion chan­nel now known as the Asian Food Net­work.</p>
    <p>GIV­ING BACK TO SO­CI­ETY</p>
    <p>So, in­stead of giv­ing it (our wealth) all to our chil­dren we have started think­ing about putting aside a part of it for char­ity. I think we have to be a lit­tle less self-fo­cused and give back to so­ci­ety. We told our chil­dren they can con­trib­ute to the fund (in fu­ture).</p>
    <p>DR AU­DREY LOOI. She and her hus­band plan to leave $200,000 or more in their will to sup­port iC2 PrepHouse’s work and to fund schol­ar­ships for needy SMU un­der­grads.</p>
