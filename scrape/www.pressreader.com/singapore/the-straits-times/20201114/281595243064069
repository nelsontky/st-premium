    <p>Gov­ern­ments have a re­spon­si­bil­ity to help those ad­versely im­pacted by glob­al­i­sa­tion or they risk so­cial frag­men­ta­tion, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“With­out co­her­ent gov­ern­ment, with­out do­mes­tic con­fi­dence, few, if any, gov­ern­ments will have the courage or the po­lit­i­cal space to stand up on the in­ter­na­tional stage to con­tinue to sup­port glob­al­i­sa­tion,” he added.</p>
    <p>De­liv­er­ing the keynote speech at the Caixin sum­mit ti­tled Re­build­ing Global Trust, Mr Chan urged coun­tries to con­front their longterm chal­lenges as a way to build pub­lic trust and to cham­pion glob­al­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>He said: “In the tyranny of pop­ulist pol­i­tics against sound eco­nomics, we must lay the foun­da­tion of trust among our pop­u­lace, busi­nesses and po­lit­i­cal lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>“This will pro­vide the po­lit­i­cal space gov­ern­ments need to lay the build­ing blocks for a rules-based global or­der and con­nec­tiv­ity for the long-term well-be­ing of our coun­try, peo­ple and the world.”</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said that the Covid-19 pan­demic has “chal­lenged and at times eroded pub­lic trust to­wards gov­ern­ments”, given that anx­i­ety lev­els have risen due to employment and eco­nomic woes.</p>
    <p>On a global level, the anx­i­eties have wors­ened geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions be­fore Covid-19 and, as a re­sult, “trust in mul­ti­lat­eral in­sti­tu­tions and plat­forms has di­min­ished”, he added.</p>
    <p>Many coun­tries have re­sponded to the anx­i­eties by try­ing to move sup­ply chains closer to home and boost­ing do­mes­tic pro­duc­tion ca­pa­bil­i­ties to avoid be­ing crit­i­cally af­fected by sud­den short­ages in essen­tial goods, Mr Chan pointed out.</p>
    <p>“As pro­tec­tion­ist and anti-glob­al­i­sa­tion sen­ti­ments grow, many coun­tries have re­sponded by turn­ing in­wards,” he noted.</p>
    <p>But that can­not be the way, he said. As a small and open econ­omy, Sin­ga­pore be­lieves that greater eco­nomic re­silience comes from sup­ply chain di­ver­sity and greater in­ter­de­pen­dence, not from self-iso­la­tion, he said.</p>
    <p>“Over the years, the rules-based mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing sys­tem has brought eco­nomic growth, sta­bil­ity and peace to many coun­tries,” said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>“While glob­al­i­sa­tion may have its short­falls, there will be a net drop in over­all global wel­fare if ev­ery coun­try pur­sues eco­nomic in­de­pen­dence sin­gle-mind­edly with­out re­gard for its neigh­bours. We will be worse off, and we can eas­ily go back to his­tory... to the times be­fore the Great De­pres­sion,” he added.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has been an im­por­tant re­minder of how in­ex­tri­ca­bly in­ter­de­pen­dent we are, and that eco­nomic in­de­pen­dence is not a vi­able op­tion or the most pre­ferred op­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan also said China, be­ing the world’s sec­ond largest econ­omy, has a his­toric op­por­tu­nity to win global trust by ex­em­pli­fy­ing stan­dards of be­hav­iour to­wards global trade – “from hav­ing open mar­kets (to) shar­ing tech­nolo­gies on open plat­forms and be­ing col­lab­o­ra­tive and con­nected with the re­gion”.</p>
    <p>“How China en­gages with the rest of the world will im­pact global trust to­wards China’s rise. The world is lis­ten­ing and watch­ing in­tently as China im­ple­ments its dual cir­cu­la­tion strat­egy,” he added, re­fer­ring to Bei­jing’s move away from its fo­cus on ex­port-led de­vel­op­ment to one where its do­mes­tic and in­ter­na­tional economies are mu­tu­ally re­in­forc­ing.</p>
