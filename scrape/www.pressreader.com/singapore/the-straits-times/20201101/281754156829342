    <p>In the past year, nearly 60 per cent of un­der­grad­u­ates at Sin­ga­pore’s two largest uni­ver­si­ties took pre­cau­tions like lock­ing their hos­tel rooms and tak­ing more pub­lic paths to avoid be­ing sex­u­ally ha­rassed.</p>
    <p>This was among the key find­ings in a sur­vey com­mis­sioned last week by The Sun­day Times to find out how ground sen­ti­ment on sex­ual mis­con­duct in uni­ver­si­ties has changed in the past year.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey, which was con­ducted by on­line mar­ket re­search firm Milieu In­sight, polled 440 cur­rent stu­dents from the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) and Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Uni­ver­sity (NTU) over six days in late Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>The poll is sub­ject to a mar­gin of er­ror that is com­pa­ra­ble with other re­search sur­veys.</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity of them, or 68 per cent, said they have no­ticed changes in their uni­ver­si­ties’ poli­cies on sex­ual mis­con­duct in the past year or so af­ter the saga in­volv­ing for­mer NUS stu­dent Mon­ica Baey.</p>
    <p>Most of the stu­dents polled – 76 per cent – also said their uni­ver­si­ties took cases of sex­ual mis­con­duct se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>At the same time, more than 80 per cent of stu­dents were con­cerned about re­cent cases of sex­ual mis­con­duct ap­pear­ing in the news. Th­ese in­clude al­le­ga­tions against for­mer Tem­busu Col­lege fel­low Jeremy Fer­nando, and court cases in­volv­ing ter­tiary stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Two per cent of re­spon­dents re­ported be­ing vic­tims of sex­ual ha­rass­ment in the past year, al­though the fig­ure rises to 20 per cent when asked if they knew a friend who had ex­pe­ri­enced such in­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­cluded re­ceiv­ing lewd jokes and ex­plicit text mes­sages, be­ing stalked on cam­pus, be­ing the vic­tims of voyeurism and out­rage of mod­esty.</p>
    <p>The on­line poll found that 73 per cent of fe­male stu­dents took their own pre­cau­tions to avoid any chance of be­ing ha­rassed on cam­pus, and 44 per cent of male stu­dents re­ported do­ing the same.</p>
    <p>Of this group of re­spon­dents, about 60 per cent said they take more pub­lic paths on cam­pus in­stead of se­cluded ones, or move around school with friends.</p>
    <p>The same pro­por­tion said they check for out­siders be­fore go­ing into the shower, and lock their hall rooms when they are in­side.</p>
    <p>About 15 per cent said they moved out of their hos­tels, while other safe­guards in­cluded not go­ing out late at night on cam­pus.</p>
    <p>More broadly, stu­dents had mixed feel­ings about how safe their uni­ver­si­ties are.</p>
    <p>A slight ma­jor­ity – 53 per cent – said there was no change in their per­cep­tion of whether cam­puses were safer in the past year, de­spite tighter se­cu­rity mea­sures.</p>
    <p>But an­other 42 per cent said they felt safer on cam­pus, be­cause of stricter pun­ish­ments and more proac­tive steps taken by uni­ver­si­ties to deal with of­fences.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents said the sur­vey re­sults re­flect some change in at­ti­tudes to­wards sex­ual ha­rass­ment.</p>
    <p>While stu­dents are in­creas­ingly aware of po­ten­tial dan­gers that lurk on cam­puses, they also think their uni­ver­si­ties are com­ing to terms with how se­ri­ous the is­sue is.</p>
    <p>NUS fourth-year civil engi­neer­ing stu­dent Wen­jun Wang, 22, who lives in a res­i­den­tial col­lege, said: “Now the show­er­ing cu­bi­cles are blocked from floor to ceil­ing, so it’s quite hard for some­one to take a video. For me, it feels a lot safer.”</p>
    <p>Most of her friends who stay on mixed-gen­der floors pre­fer to go to the toi­let with friends, she said, adding that her room is quite close to the toi­let, so she does not need a friend to ac­com­pany her.</p>
    <p>NUS first-year in­for­ma­tion sys­tems stu­dent Irene Lai, 20, who also stays on cam­pus, said: “The toi­let cu­bi­cles are en­closed and there are CCTVs out­side the toi­let.</p>
    <p>“The only pre­cau­tion I take is to lock my room door when I’m sleep­ing be­cause I’ve heard of cases where the girl was half-asleep and some­one was watch­ing her sleep.”</p>
    <p>There is room for the uni­ver­si­ties to do more, said stu­dents. For in­stance, the mod­ules on sex­ual ha­rass­ment and con­sent are not taken se­ri­ously by some of their peers, and could be im­proved, they said.</p>
    <p>NTU third-year pub­lic pol­icy and global af­fairs stu­dent Bryan Chiew, 23, said: “Changes have been made, and as for­mer pres­i­dent of the stu­dents’ union, I know NTU has been work­ing to strengthen its vic­tim sup­port and penalty frame­works even be­fore Mon­ica’s in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>“But I do feel much more can be done proac­tively to ed­u­cate and cre­ate aware­ness within the cam­pus com­mu­nity.”</p>
