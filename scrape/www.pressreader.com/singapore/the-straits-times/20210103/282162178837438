    <p>It was for­merly un­charted ter­ri­tory for many re­tail busi­nesses, but the on­line space quickly be­came the place to be in 2020. And so­cial com­merce is one of the top re­tail trends to watch in 2021.</p>
    <p>As pan­demic lock­downs shut brick-and-mor­tar stores in phases around the world, shop­pers moved their con­sump­tion of goods and ser­vices on­line.</p>
    <p>E-com­merce play­ers such as Lazada, Shopee and Zalora turfed out phys­i­cal re­tail­ers, with each re­port­ing ma­jor spikes in plat­form and user growth.</p>
    <p>For Lazada Sin­ga­pore, “2020 was a year of break­ing records”, says its chief ex­ec­u­tive James Chang.</p>
    <p>The plat­form’s monthly sales hit nine fig­ures for the first time in June and saw its high­est traf­fic in Septem­ber. It broke new records in Novem­ber with more than one mil­lion vis­i­tors on Sin­gles’ Day on Nov 11 – the world’s big­gest sales event – alone.</p>
    <p>Re­gion­ally, more than 100 mil­lion users ac­cessed the app in July.</p>
    <p>Mr Chang says: “We have also seen a wide adop­tion of e-com­merce this year, with many brands (such as Marks & Spencer and Un­der Ar­mour), sellers and users get­ting on the Lazada plat­form for the first time. It is a re­flec­tion of the seis­mic shift in how busi­nesses see e-com­merce as a core busi­ness strat­egy.”</p>
    <p>Another on­line mar­ket­place, Shopee, saw users here spend more time in-app, an av­er­age of 40 per cent more a week, says its chief com­mer­cial of­fi­cer Zhou Jun­jie.</p>
    <p>Di­rect en­gage­ment be­tween brands and sellers also rose, with over 200,000 mes­sages sent daily on av­er­age; and a hike of 40 times in the num­ber of Shopee Live streams from brands and sellers.</p>
    <p>Con­sumers headed on­line first for more needs too, says Mr Zhou, point­ing to the in­crease in or­ders for fit­ness and yoga equip­ment, and big­ger-ticket items such as elec­tron­ics and fur­ni­ture.</p>
    <p>“E-com­merce has evolved be­yond be­ing a plat­form to pur­chase es­sen­tial needs, to one that con­nects peo­ple and busi­nesses,” he adds.</p>
    <p>Over at Zalora, more than two mil­lion users down­loaded its app in the se­cond quar­ter of last year, with the share of new con­sumer con­tri­bu­tion to rev­enues jump­ing by more than 100 per cent.</p>
    <p>Growth in on­line shopping in Sin­ga­pore also “sky­rock­eted by 109 per cent” last year, ac­cord­ing to Zalora’s Tren­der Re­port pub­lished last month.</p>
    <p>Con­sumers world­wide are now more con­fi­dent and open to buy­ing things on­line, a habit they de­vel­oped dur­ing lock­down, says Zalora’s se­nior strat­egy di­rec­tor Qu­iron Cunha. “Re­tail busi­nesses are real­is­ing that dig­i­tal can no longer be op­tional in their strat­egy and many have adopted an om­nichan­nel ap­proach,” he adds.</p>
    <p>The year ahead con­tin­ues to look rosy for the on­line mar­ket­place.</p>
    <p>E-re­tail­ers tell The Sun­day Times they pre­dict that live streams and i mmer­sive so­cial com­merce will be the next big thing in on­line shopping.</p>
    <p>Re­gion­ally, Shopee ob­served an in­crease in live streams of up to 70 times. Dur­ing its 12.12 shopping fes­ti­val on Dec 12, the plat­form clocked 2.7 bil­lion plays on in-app games and 450 mil­lion views on Shopee Live over three weeks.</p>
    <p>Cre­at­ing an en­gag­ing and per­son­alised ex­pe­ri­ence for the shop­per is crit­i­cal to stand­ing out in a crowded mar­ket­place, says Mr Zhou. “To­day’s users are more so­cial and de­mand a more mean­ing­ful and en­ter­tain­ing on­line shopping ex­pe­ri­ence. Shopee con­tin­u­ously im­proves its in-app en­gage­ment fea­tures (to make) the ex­pe­ri­ence more so­cial.”</p>
    <p>Mr Cunha says: “As peo­ple spend more time on so­cial me­dia plat­forms, reach­ing them through in­ter­ac­tive fea­tures is key in get­ting their at­ten­tion.”</p>
    <p>He fore­sees in­flu­encers or con­tent cre­ators con­tin­u­ing to shape shopping be­hav­iour. “These new in­flu­encers – nor­mal peo­ple who built their own brands through stim­u­lat­ing con­tent on so­cial me­dia – are more re­lat­able than tra­di­tional celebri­ties. About 71 per cent of con­sumers are more likely to make a pur­chase on­line based on so­cial me­dia re­fer­rals.”</p>
    <p>Ad­vance­ments in tech­nol­ogy, he adds, will plug gaps i n om­nichan­nel con­sump­tion, such as try­ing on cloth­ing.</p>
    <p>He says: “Soon, shifts in aug­mented re­al­ity and vir­tual re­al­ity tech will en­able a bet­ter ex­e­cu­tion of vir­tual tri­als, which are not only im­mer­sive but also en­gag­ing.”</p>
    <p>Mr Chang sees live stream­ing as “the next fron­tier of shopping on­line, es­pe­cially in a post-pan­demic world”.</p>
    <p>He says: “The (Lazada) mar­ket­place has be­come live­lier with a mul­ti­tude of brands hold­ing events, prod­uct launches and live streams. With Covid-19 ac­cel­er­at­ing the nor­mal­i­sa­tion of on­line shopping, we ex­pect this trend to en­dure as economies re­sume and more brands, re­tail­ers and malls mi­grate on­line.”</p>
