    <p>Sales­man Ed­die Chow had faced an ag­o­nis­ing choice back in March when bor­ders were clos­ing – stay in Sin­ga­pore and pro­tect his much-needed job or re­turn to Malaysia to see his dy­ing dad.</p>
    <p>When it came to the crunch, he found he really had only one op­tion: “Many of my friends chose to stay in Sin­ga­pore so they could con­tinue with their work. But I de­cided to re­turn home to my dy­ing fa­ther. I wanted to walk his last jour­ney with him.”</p>
    <p>Two weeks after Malaysia shut its border on March 18, Mr Chow’s 78-year-old fa­ther died.</p>
    <p>It was the low point in what had been a dis­tress­ing pe­riod after the doc­tor had told Mr Chow, 39, that his fa­ther’s can­cer was at the end stage and he was near­ing death.</p>
    <p>While it was hard enough cop­ing with the loss of his fa­ther dur­ing the pan­demic, Mr Chow was also over­come by fear of los­ing his job in Sin­ga­pore. There was a car loan and a mort­gage to ser­vice and two young chil­dren to pro­vide for.</p>
    <p>Mr Chow started his ca­reer with Gain City as a sales­man nine years ago and four years later, he was pro­moted to head the au­dio vis­ual depart­ment. He was among around 100,000 Malaysians who com­muted daily to Sin­ga­pore for work be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Chow de­clined to re­veal his salary but said that it re­lied heav­ily on com­mis­sions and with the high ex­change rate, he was able to pro­vide for his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>While he was back in Malaysia after the border closed, he was forced to draw on his sav­ings to pay for house­hold ex­penses.</p>
    <p>“My wife doesn’t earn much from her out­door sales job. To sup­ple­ment the house­hold ex­penses, she bakes cakes to sell on­line,” said Mr Chow. “Since I had no work, I helped to de­liver the cakes. Dur­ing Mother’s Day, we got more or­ders and sold about six cakes.”</p>
    <p>He said the re­open­ing of the Sin­ga­pore-Malaysia border last Monday was like a life­line given that his hard-earned sav­ings were just about gone.</p>
    <p>Mr Chow is grate­ful to his em­ployer for spon­sor­ing his re­turn to Sin­ga­pore un­der the Pe­ri­odic Com­mut­ing Ar­range­ment (PCA) scheme. To­gether with nine col­leagues, Mr Chow walked across the Cause­way to Sin­ga­pore last Monday.</p>
    <p>He told The Sunday Times from his Gey­lang ho­tel room, where he was serv­ing seven days of a stay­home no­tice, last Thurs­day: “It wasn’t an easy de­ci­sion to make – to re­turn to Sin­ga­pore to work and not know when I can see my fam­ily again.</p>
    <p>“I have been with my wife for 12 years and this is the first time that we are be­ing sep­a­rated (for so long). She is be­ing left alone to take care of our eight-month-old son and five-year-old daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>“With the cur­rent rules on trav­el­ling un­der the PCA, I don’t think I can af­ford to make it home to cel­e­brate my son’s first birth­day with him in De­cem­ber. I also can’t make it back for my wed­ding an­niver­sary and wife’s birth­day.</p>
    <p>“I told my wife no mat­ter how much we miss each other, we have to en­dure this sep­a­ra­tion so that I can con­tinue to pro­vide for my fam­ily and our chil­dren can have a bet­ter fu­ture.”</p>
