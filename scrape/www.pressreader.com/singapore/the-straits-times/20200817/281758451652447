    <p>MANILA • Forced off the road by coro­n­avirus lock­downs, Philip­pine “jeep­ney” driver Daniel Flores now plies the streets of Manila on foot begging for money to feed his hun­gry fam­ily.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old has not picked up a pas­sen­ger since March, when pub­lic trans­port was halted and peo­ple were or­dered to stay home as Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte’s govern­ment tried to slow the fast­spread­ing con­ta­gion.</p>
    <p>Jeep­neys – first made from left­over US jeeps after World War II – are a na­tional sym­bol in the Philip­pines, and serve as the back­bone of the coun­try’s trans­port sys­tem, pro­vid­ing rides for mil­lions of peo­ple across the coun­try for as lit­tle as nine pe­sos (25 Sin­ga­pore cents).</p>
    <p>But driv­ers such as Mr Flores, and mil­lions of oth­ers, are out of work after the months-long re­stric­tions crip­pled the econ­omy, plung­ing it into re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>With no in­come and debts pil­ing up, Mr Flores started liv­ing in the jeep­ney with his wife, two of his chil­dren and a fel­low driver after they were evicted from their apart­ment be­cause they could no longer pay the rent.</p>
    <p>In­stead of sit­ting be­hind the wheel, Mr Flores has spent many days begging for alms just to get by.</p>
    <p>Other driv­ers carry plas­tic con­tain­ers and card­board signs around their necks to catch the at­ten­tion and sym­pa­thy of pass­ing mo­torists.</p>
    <p>“We have ab­so­lutely noth­ing left to spend,” Mr Flores told Agence France-Presse as he sat in­side his jeep­ney, parked in a street and crammed with cook­ing pots, clothes and other pos­ses­sions.</p>
    <p>A sign ask­ing for help from passers-by sits on top of the ve­hi­cle, which his em­pa­thetic boss has loaned him.</p>
    <p>Flat­tened card­board boxes cover the side win­dows and rear en­trance to give the fam­ily some pri­vacy – and a feel­ing of pro­tec­tion from the virus they fear is lurk­ing out­side.</p>
    <p>As the num­ber of con­firmed in­fec­tions in the Philip­pines surges past 157,000 – the high­est i n South-east Asia – and Manila en­dures an­other lock­down, Mr Flores has no idea when he will be al­lowed to drive again.</p>
    <p>GO­ING HUN­GRY</p>
    <p>We have ab­so­lutely noth­ing left to spend... Of­ten, we will eat just once a day. Some­times, if no one helps us, we don’t eat at all.’’</p>
    <p>MR DANIEL FLORES, who is now liv­ing in a jeep­ney with his wife and chil­dren after they were evicted from their apart­ment. RISK­ING LIFE AND LIMB</p>
    <p>One time, we were al­most hit by a car, but we don’t re­ally have a choice. We have to leave our homes and take our chances in the streets just to have some­thing in our growl­ing stom­achs.’’</p>
    <p>MR SESINANDO BON­DOC, 73, on how jeep­ney driv­ers like him­self have had to stand on the road­side to beg for alms.</p>
    <p>He oc­ca­sion­ally picks up odd jobs sell­ing scrap metal, paint­ing or weld­ing. But it is not enough to feed his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“Of­ten we will eat just once a day. Some­times, if no one helps us, we don’t eat at all,” Mr Flores said.</p>
    <p>So dire is their predica­ment that the cou­ple sent their seven-mon­thold baby to live with rel­a­tives out­side Manila to ease pres­sure on them­selves and en­sure the child gets enough food.</p>
    <p>Mr Sesinando Bon­doc, 73, started driv­ing a jeep­ney when he was 28, and at his age, find­ing an­other job seems im­pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Stand­ing on the side of a busy road in swel­ter­ing heat with other driv­ers ask­ing for money, Mr Bon­doc said the de­sire to eat over­rides his fear of the virus or speed­ing cars.</p>
    <p>“One time, we were al­most hit by a car, but we don’t re­ally have a choice. We have to leave our homes and take our chances in the streets just to have some­thing in our growl­ing stom­achs,” Mr Bon­doc said, his voice crack­ing as he fought back tears.</p>
    <p>Driv­ers have re­ceived some money and food hand­outs from the govern­ment. But it does not make up for their lost in­come.</p>
    <p>In June, six jeep­ney driv­ers were ar­rested by po­lice for al­legedly vi­o­lat­ing a ban on mass gath­er­ings and rules on so­cial dis­tanc­ing after they protested over the loss of their liveli­hoods. They were later re­leased on bail.</p>
    <p>Even when the ini­tial lock­down re­stric­tions in Manila were eased in June, only a frac­tion of the city’s roughly 55,000 jeep­neys were al­lowed to op­er­ate un­der strict rules.</p>
    <p>Driv­ers had to make their ve­hi­cles virus-safe by in­stalling plas­tic seat di­viders and re­duc­ing ca­pac­ity to com­ply with so­cial dis­tanc­ing reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Those used to pock­et­ing as much as 1,500 pe­sos a day had to set­tle for much smaller tak­ings.</p>
    <p>Then a new lock­down im­posed nearly two weeks ago in Manila and four sur­round­ing prov­inces – home to a quar­ter of the coun­try’s pop­u­la­tion – forced those lucky few off the road.</p>
    <p>Some are wor­ried they may never drive again as the govern­ment phases out smoke-belch­ing jeep­neys that are 15 years or older.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme to mod­ernise the ve­hi­cles was due to fin­ish this year. The govern­ment has not an­nounced if the dead­line will be ex­tended.</p>
    <p>Mr Re­nato Gan­das, 57, who has been a driver for 30 years, said the owner of his ve­hi­cle had al­ready sold a jeep­ney due to the phasin­gout pro­gramme and the lock­downs.</p>
    <p>With his liveli­hood at risk, Mr Gan­das is los­ing hope.</p>
    <p>“We might just beg for alms for the rest of our lives,” he said.</p>
