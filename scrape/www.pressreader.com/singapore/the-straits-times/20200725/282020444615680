    <p>Greek philoso­pher Aris­to­tle did not merely con­done slav­ery, he de­fended it; he did not merely de­fend it, but de­fended it as ben­e­fi­cial to the slave. His view was that some peo­ple are, by na­ture, un­able to pur­sue their own good, and are best suited to be “liv­ing tools” for use by other peo­ple: “The slave is a part of the mas­ter, a liv­ing but sep­a­rated part of his bod­ily frame.”</p>
    <p>Aris­to­tle’s anti-lib­er­al­ism does not stop there. He be­lieved that women were in­ca­pable of au­thor­i­ta­tive de­ci­sion-mak­ing. And he de­creed that man­ual labour­ers, de­spite be­ing nei­ther slaves nor women, were none­the­less pro­hib­ited from cit­i­zen­ship or ed­u­ca­tion in his ideal city.</p>
    <p>Of course, Aris­to­tle is not alone: Kant and Hume made racist com­ments, and Wittgen­stein was brac­ingly up­front about his sex­ism.</p>
    <p>Should read­ers set aside or ig­nore such re­marks, fo­cus­ing at­ten­tion on valu­able ideas to be found else­where in their work?</p>
    <p>This pick-and-choose strat­egy may work in the case of Kant, Hume, Frege and Wittgen­stein, on the grounds that their core philo­soph­i­cal con­tri­bu­tions are un­re­lated to their prej­u­dices, but I do not think it ap­plies so well to Aris­to­tle: His ine­gal­i­tar­i­an­ism runs deep. He thought that the value or worth of a hu­man be­ing – his virtue – was some­thing that he ac­quired in grow­ing up. It fol­lows that peo­ple who can’t (women, slaves) or sim­ply don’t (man­ual labour­ers) ac­quire that virtue have no grounds for de­mand­ing equal re­spect or recog­ni­tion with those who do.</p>
    <p>As I read him, not only did Aris­to­tle not be­lieve in the con­cep­tion of in­trin­sic hu­man dig­nity that grounds our mod­ern com­mit­ment to hu­man rights, but his phi­los­o­phy also can­not be squared with it.</p>
    <p>His ine­gal­i­tar­i­an­ism is less like Kant and Hume’s racism and more like Descartes’ views on non-hu­man an­i­mals: The fact that Descartes char­ac­terises non-hu­man an­i­mals as soul­less au­tom­ata is a di­rect con­se­quence of his ra­tio­nal­ist du­al­ism. His com­ments on an­i­mals can­not be treated as “stray re­marks”.</p>
    <p>If can­cel­la­tion is re­moval from a po­si­tion of promi­nence on the ba­sis of an ide­o­log­i­cal crime, it might ap­pear that there is a case to be made for can­celling Aris­to­tle. He has much promi­nence: Thou­sands of years af­ter his death, his eth­i­cal works con­tinue to be taught as part of the ba­sic phi­los­o­phy cur­ricu­lum of­fered in col­leges and uni­ver­si­ties around the world. And Aris­to­tle’s mis­take was se­ri­ous enough that he comes off badly even when com­pared with the var­i­ous “bad guys” of his­tory who sought to jus­tify the ex­clu­sion of cer­tain groups – women, black peo­ple, Jews, gays, athe­ists – from the shel­ter­ing um­brella of hu­man dig­nity.</p>
    <p>Yet I would de­fend Aris­to­tle, and his place in phi­los­o­phy syl­labuses, by point­ing to the ben­e­fits of en­gag­ing with him. He can help us iden­tify the grounds of our own egal­i­tar­ian com­mit­ments; and his eth­i­cal sys­tem may cap­ture truths – for in­stance, about the im­por­tance of aim­ing for ex­tra­or­di­nary ex­cel­lence – that we have yet to in­cor­po­rate into our own.</p>
    <p>And I want to go a step fur­ther, and make an even stronger claim on be­half of Aris­to­tle. It is not just that the ben­e­fits of read­ing Aris­to­tle coun­ter­act the costs, but that there are no costs. In fact we have no rea­son at all to can­cel Aris­to­tle. Aris­to­tle is sim­ply not our en­emy. I, like Aris­to­tle, am a philoso­pher, and we philoso­phers must coun­te­nance the pos­si­bil­ity of rad­i­cal dis­agree­ment on the most fun­da­men­tal ques­tions. Philoso­phers hold up as an ideal the aim of never treat­ing our in­ter­locu­tor as a hos­tile com­bat­ant. But if some­one puts for­ward views that di­rectly con­tra­dict your moral sen­si­bil­i­ties, how can you avoid hos­til­ity?</p>
    <p>The an­swer is to take him lit­er­ally – which is to say, read his words purely as ve­hi­cles for the con­tents of his be­liefs.</p>
    <p>There is a kind of speech that it would be a mis­take to take lit­er­ally, be­cause its func­tion is some kind of mes­sag­ing. Ad­ver­tis­ing and po­lit­i­cal or­a­tory are ex­am­ples of mes­sag­ing, as is much that falls un­der the rubric of “mak­ing a state­ment”, like boy­cotting, protest­ing or pub­licly apol­o­gis­ing.</p>
    <p>Such words ex­ist to per­form some ex­tra-com­mu­nica­tive task; in mes­sag­ing speech, some aim other than truth-seek­ing is al­ways at play.</p>
    <p>One way to turn lit­eral speech into mes­sag­ing is to at­tach a list of names: a pe­ti­tion is an ex­am­ple of non-lit­eral speech, be­cause more peo­ple be­liev­ing some­thing does not make it more true.</p>
    <p>Whereas lit­eral speech em­ploys sys­tem­at­i­cally truth-di­rected meth­ods of per­sua­sion – ar­gu­ment and ev­i­dence – mes­sag­ing ex­erts some kind of non-ra­tio­nal pres­sure on its re­cip­i­ent. For ex­am­ple, a pub­lic apol­ogy can of­ten ex­ert so­cial pres­sure on the in­jured party to for­give, or at any rate to per­form a show of for­give­ness.</p>
    <p>Mes­sag­ing is of­ten sit­u­ated within some kind of power strug­gle. In a highly charged po­lit­i­cal cli­mate, more and more speech be­comes mag­net­i­cally at­tracted into mes­sag­ing; one can hardly say any­thing with­out arous­ing sus­pi­cion that one is mak­ing a move in the game, one that might call for a coun­ter­move.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the words “Black lives mat­ter” and “All lives mat­ter” have been im­pli­cated in a po­lit­i­cal power strug­gle in such a way as to pre­vent any­one fa­mil­iar with that strug­gle from us­ing, or hear­ing, them lit­er­ally.</p>
    <p>But if an alien from outer space, un­fa­mil­iar with this con­text, came to us and said ei­ther phrase, it would be hard to imag­ine that any­one would find it ob­jec­tion­able; the con­text in which we now use those phrases would be re­moved.</p>
    <p>In fact, I can imag­ine cir­cum­stances un­der which an alien could say women are in­fe­rior to men with­out arous­ing of­fence in me. Sup­pose this alien had no gen­der on their planet, and drew the con­clu­sion of fe­male in­fe­ri­or­ity from time spent ob­serv­ing ours. As long as the alien spoke to me re­spect­fully, I would not only be will­ing to hear it out but even in­ter­ested to learn its ar­gu­ment.</p>
    <p>I read Aris­to­tle as such an “alien”. His ap­proach to ethics was em­pir­i­cal – that is, it was based on ob­ser­va­tion – and when he looked around him he saw a world of slav­ery and of the sub­ju­ga­tion of women and man­ual labour­ers, a sit­u­a­tion he then in­scribed into his eth­i­cal the­ory.</p>
    <p>When I read him, I see that view of the world – and that’s all. I do not read an evil in­tent or ul­te­rior mo­tive be­hind his words; I do not in­ter­pret them as a mark of his bad char­ac­ter, or as at­tempt­ing to con­vey a dan­ger­ous mes­sage that I might need to combat or si­lence in or­der to pro­tect the vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>Of course, in one sense, it is hard to imag­ine a more dan­ger­ous idea than the one that he ar­tic­u­lated and ar­gued for – but dan­ger­ous­ness, I have been ar­gu­ing, is less a mat­ter of lit­eral con­tent than mes­sag­ing con­text.</p>
    <p>What makes speech truly free is the pos­si­bil­ity of dis­agree­ment with­out en­mity, and this is less a mat­ter of what we can say, than how we can say it.</p>
    <p>“Can­cel cul­ture” is merely the log­i­cal ex­ten­sion of what we might call “mes­sag­ing cul­ture”, in which every act of speech is clas­si­fied as friend or foe, in which lit­eral con­tent can barely be com­mu­ni­cated, and in which very lit­tle faith ex­ists as to the ra­tio­nal fac­ul­ties of those be­ing spo­ken to.</p>
    <p>In such a con­text, even the cry for “free speech” in­vites a non-lit­eral in­ter­pre­ta­tion, as be­ing noth­ing but the most ef­fi­cient way for its ad­vo­cates to ac­quire or con­sol­i­date power.</p>
    <p>I will ad­mit that Aris­to­tle’s vast tem­po­ral dis­tance from us makes it ar­ti­fi­cially easy to treat him as an “alien”. One of the rea­sons I grav­i­tate to the study of an­cient ethics is pre­cisely that it is dif­fi­cult to en­tan­gle those au­thors in con­tem­po­rary power strug­gles.</p>
    <p>When we turn to dis­agree­ment on highly charged con­tem­po­rary eth­i­cal ques­tions, such as de­bates about gen­der iden­tity, we find sus­pi­cion, sec­ond-guess­ing of mo­tives, pe­ti­tion­ing – the hall­marks of mes­sag­ing cul­ture – even among philoso­phers.</p>
    <p>I do not claim that the pos­si­bil­ity of friendly dis­agree­ment with Aris­to­tle of­fers any di­rect guid­ance on how to im­prove our much more dif­fi­cult dis­agree­ments with our con­tem­po­raries, but I do think con­sid­er­ing the case of Aris­to­tle re­veals some­thing about what the tar­get of such im­prove­ments would be. What we want, when we want free speech, is the free­dom to speak lit­er­ally.</p>
