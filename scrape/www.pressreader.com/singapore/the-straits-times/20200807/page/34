Will more people use the same excuse not to pay damages to victims?
To let him get away is to tell a 21-year-old man that he does not have to pay for the lifelong injury he has caused to a defenceles­s woman. said Mr Ting has no assets and that it was of no use going after him.
Do people have the liberty to ignore a court judgment?
Does Mr Ting get away scot-free I read with disbelief Mr Leong Loon Wah’s helplessne­ss to get e-scooter rider Nicholas Ting Nai Jie to pay the court-ordered damages for causing severe injuries to Mr Leong’s wife (Tough fight for family to get compensati­on from PMD rider, Aug 2).
Mr Ting said that he was unable to pay the $445,000. His lawyer One way to get around having pedestrian­s and personal mobility device (PMD) users share a path is to get everyone to just put away their smartphone­s and other electronic devices and look up (Pedestrian­s urged to keep left on shared paths in code of conduct, Aug 5).
The updated code of conduct is good but can be made better by banning the use of mobile phones and all electronic devices while people are walking on the shared path or footpath.
Pedestrian­s should be made to stop and step aside when they want to use their smartphone­s, then continue walking when done.
Pedestrian­s walking from point A to B without checking on their smartphone­s during this short period will not be seriously inconvenie­nced. Esther Chin Siew Lan Excerpts from readers’ letters If an independen­t company is representi­ng a government agency, should there not be an official announceme­nt on MCI’s website that the public can refer to, lest innocent Singaporea­ns fall victim to scams? and may even be in violation of the Personal Data Protection Act.
The authoritie­s should look into companies that extract personal informatio­n from customers through methods such as registerin­g for a product warranty. CONFINEMEN­T NANNY CANNOT TRAVEL SURVEY LEGITIMACY UNCLEAR My daughter is due to deliver her baby within the next week or so, and had made arrangemen­ts six months ago for a confinemen­t nanny from Malaysia to come down to help after the birth.
But while the two schemes under which cross-border travel between Singapore and Malaysia will resume are good for businesses (Strict rules for S’pore, Malaysia border travel, Aug 2), they are not available to the confinemen­t nanny, and my daughter’s hopes of getting help have been quashed. Last month, I received a home phone call from someone who claimed to be from an independen­t company representi­ng the Ministry of Communicat­ions and Informatio­n (MCI).
The caller claimed my home number was randomly generated by their system to do a survey on Singaporea­ns’ satisfacti­on level with housing. The first five questions, however, had nothing to do with housing, and the sixth question was on Housing Board flats, which I do not live in. Foo Siang Yian Relook scale of Tuas Port project Sng Lei Fong Alexander Chee Kuan Hock will work out as planned. The Internatio­nal Monetary Fund has declared this the worst recession since the Great Depression, and recovery will take a long time.
I think it is necessary to recalibrat­e the constructi­on of this port by perhaps slowing it down by a few years or even scaling the project down.
If the envisioned growth in world shipping were not to materialis­e as projected by the time the port is fully operationa­l in 2040, resources will not be utilised correctly. I fully agree with The Straits Times’ editorial that “amid the sweeping changes to the external environmen­t brought on by the coronaviru­s pandemic”, it will be a challenge to maintain the status of the two key hubs of Changi Airport and the sea port (Keeping hub status will be a challenge, Aug 4).
A decision has already been made by the authoritie­s to postpone the constructi­on of Terminal 5 for at least two years. What about the Tuas Port?
Its constructi­on was premised on world commerce expanding every year. I now wonder if things ’’ FIRM ASKED FOR PERSONAL DETAILS When registerin­g online for the warranty of a mattress I had purchased, I was asked to submit details such as my NRIC number, personal income and type of property, which are totally irrelevant to a mattress warranty Chong Chie Seng NAC stepping up efforts to alleviate shortage of arts spaces ICA factors in Covid-19 constraint­s when extending visit passes current Covid–19 crisis, revenue and fund raising have been severely impacted and the flexibilit­y of hiring spaces on a pay-per-use basis will make economic sense for many arts companies.
Beyond the pandemic, for long-term sustainabi­lity of the scene, the NAC will step up efforts to approach corporate and community partners to alleviate the shortage of subsidised arts spaces.
This will also help create more options and opportunit­ies for independen­t arts groups, both establishe­d and newly created. Phillip Tan Fong Lip Giving to others is a powerful form of self-care support them in the work they do, while balancing the larger needs of the whole ecosystem.
The NAC’s subsidised arts spaces have grown almost fivefold since 1985, but demand continues to exceed supply, with open calls for tenancies oversubscr­ibed.
Under our five-year SG Arts
Plan, the NAC will unlock more public and private spaces by developing co-location strategies and shared facilities, so as to match demand and best support and sustain our arts community and talents in the long term.
Not surprising­ly, with the We thank Mr Jeffrey Say Seck Leong for his views on arts spaces (Arts companies need permanent homes to grow, July 28).
We agree that independen­t arts companies are part of a diverse, vibrant landscape. The Necessary Stage, Intercultu­ral Theatre Institute and The Substation are establishe­d major companies which play different roles in our arts landscape and are well recognised by audiences and the arts community.
The National Arts Council’s (NAC) approach to arts spaces has always been customised and we will continue to find ways to I agree with Professor David
Chan that the act of giving encourages positive attitudes and experience­s, which in turn builds communitie­s that nurture positivity amid Covid-19 (Foster positivity amid Covid-19 challenges, Aug 1).
It has been almost four months since the circuit breaker was implemente­d. While Singapore slowly opens up, Covid-19 remains a threat.
Businesses are struggling, and a study in April showed that almost two in three workers in Singapore feel more anxious and stressed.
A 2018 study published in the Journal of Social Psychology has found that performing acts of kindness improves the well-being of the giver, as well as the recipient, and could provide a simple, effective and inexpensiv­e means of addressing social problems ranging from social isolation to mental and physical health conditions.
A more recent study published in the Journal of Social Psychology suggests that performing acts of kindness towards our close connection­s, acquaintan­ces and ourselves – and even just observing acts of kindness – has equally positive effects on our happiness. In a social distancing world, giving to others answers our need for human connection, and is a powerful form of self-care. So how can we show kindness in the new normal?
Reach out to family, friends and colleagues with a phone call or text, especially the elderly who live alone.
Ground-up initiative­s such as GoodHoodSG and Kampung Kakis connect neighbours who need meals, or other forms of social assistance, to neighbours who are willing to help.
Giving social support – time, effort or goods – is associated with better overall health in older adults, and volunteeri­ng is associated with delayed mortality, a University of California at Berkeley study concluded.
Being thoughtful can also make a difference at home. Offering to run an errand for a family member, or simply expressing how much you care for loved ones, can brighten their day.
These everyday acts of kindness will surely build more positive, supportive and resilient communitie­s that will enable us to overcome challenges as one. We thank Ms Chong Ning Qian for her feedback (Don’t separate transnatio­nal couples in Singapore during pandemic, Aug 3).
As with most countries, we do not grant long-term immigratio­n facilities automatica­lly to foreign spouses of citizens.
The Immigratio­n and Checkpoint­s Authority (ICA) evaluates long-term visit pass (LTVP) and LTVP-Plus applicatio­ns on a range of factors, including how long they have been married and whether they have children from the marriage.
Requests for extension of stay by foreign spouses in Singapore who are on short-term visit passes are also assessed on a case-by-case basis.
The ICA does consider additional factors, such as the prevailing travel restrictio­ns in other countries and flight connectivi­ty, when assessing the renewal of the immigratio­n facilities accorded to visitors to assist those with genuine difficulti­es in the Covid-19 situation. Yeoh Phee Suan Director
Marketing, Communicat­ions and Digital Strategy National Arts Council New logo now available to help identify local produce We thank Mr Koh Juat Huang for his suggestion (Put flag on local produce, July 31).
The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has launched an SG Fresh Produce logo, which was created in consultati­on with over 30 local farmers, retailers and industry associatio­ns.
The public was also invited to pick its favourite logo designs.
The logo can be found on the packaging of local produce sold in supermarke­ts and by retailers. It incorporat­es the attributes of freshness, supporting local and the SG brand mark.
Consumers can also look out for the logo on local produce sold through online retailers, such as RedMart.
Beyond the Government’s support for local farmers to ramp up production, demand from consumers is equally important to sustain a healthy and vibrant agri-food ecosystem.
By choosing local produce, consumers can help to support our local farmers and spur them to embrace technology and boost productivi­ty. Choo Li Nah (Dr) Senior Director, Communicat­ions and Service Quality Division
