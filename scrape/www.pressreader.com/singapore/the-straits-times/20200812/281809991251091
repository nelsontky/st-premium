    <p>An as­sort­ment of In­dian video-shar­ing apps are com­pet­ing to take over the com­mand­ing po­si­tion that TikTok en­joyed in the coun­try un­til it was banned in June.</p>
    <p>More than 200 mil­lion In­dian users of the wildly pop­u­lar Chi­nese app, as well as other new users, are search­ing for the right al­ter­na­tive, ratch­et­ing up dizzy­ing growth for lo­cal video-shar­ing apps that were lit­tle known be­fore the ban.</p>
    <p>There are more than 10 ma­jor apps in the run­ning, all count­ing on a surge in techno-na­tion­al­ism for their rise against for­eign ri­vals, such as In­sta­gram Reels and the United States-based Dub­s­mash.</p>
    <p>Among the do­mes­tic front run­ners is Ro­poso, which brands it­self as “In­dia ka apna video app” (In­dia’s own video app). It has seen its num­ber of monthly ac­tive users rise from 15 mil­lion in June to 60 mil­lion last month.</p>
    <p>The ar­rival of mil­lions of new users is a wind­fall that some of these apps have not been ready to ac­com­mo­date.</p>
    <p>Mr Su­mit Ghosh, chief ex­ec­u­tive and co-founder of Chin­gari, an­other In­dian con­tender, said the day af­ter the TikTok ban its ser­vice reg­is­tered 600,000 down­loads ev­ery hour.</p>
    <p>“The whole team was up for the whole 48 hours (fol­low­ing the ban) try­ing to keep up with the users,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“Now ob­vi­ously we have scaled up and sta­bilised.”</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies have also had to ramp up staff lev­els.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Chin­gari has dou­bled its en­gi­neer­ing team – from seven to 14.</p>
    <p>In­dian apps have also be­gun spend­ing money to keep the in­flux of new users com­ing, as well as re­tain ex­ist­ing ones.</p>
    <p>“Those are the two big chal­lenges and those two are the big­gest el­e­ments in terms of the ef­forts that a com­pany puts in,” said Mr Bikash Chowd­hury, chief mar­ket­ing of­fi­cer for Glance, which owns Ro­poso.</p>
    <p>The app is try­ing to re­tain users by giv­ing them “coins”.</p>
    <p>Each user gets a few such coins for their first video and earns more sub­se­quently, based on how well their videos per­form.</p>
    <p>These coins can be re­deemed on Paytm, an In­dian dig­i­tal wal­let.</p>
    <p>Users are mint­ing as much as 100,000 ru­pees (S$1,840) a month on the plat­form through these coins.</p>
    <p>Chin­gari, mean­while, an­nounced a coun­try­wide tal­ent con­test on July 15 with a top prize of 10 mil­lion ru­pees as well as 500,000 ru­pees for each state-level win­ner.</p>
    <p>The firm ex­pects more than 10 mil­lion creators to take part.</p>
    <p>“We feel we have a very short win­dow of three to six months to fill this void that TikTok has left,” added Mr Ghosh, re­fer­ring to a pos­si­bil­ity that TikTok could re­turn to In­dia, if it meets the gov­ern­ment’s con­di­tions, and re­coup its users.</p>
    <p>The need for deep pock­ets as apps cap­i­talise on their growth has pushed start-ups to seek out fund­ing while avoid­ing Chi­nese money.</p>
    <p>Chin­gari an­nounced this week that it had re­ceived seed fund­ing of US$1.3 mil­lion (S$1.8 mil­lion) from In­dian and Amer­i­can in­vestors while Mitron raised 20 mil­lion ru­pees re­cently.</p>
    <p>Mitron founder and CEO Shivank Agar­wal told The Straits Times that the In­dian mar­ket is big enough for players to grow be­yond TikTok’s core base that catered largely to young users fo­cused on hu­mour.</p>
    <p>The smart­phone user base in In­dia is ex­pected to grow from 500 mil­lion to 900 mil­lion by 2023.</p>
    <p>“The good thing is that we were grow­ing rapidly even when TikTok was al­ready here,” he said, adding that there are op­por­tu­ni­ties in smaller cities and towns across In­dia as well as in the age seg­ment be­yond 40.</p>
    <p>How-to videos, he said, could be one such cat­e­gory for the app’s ex­pan­sion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Tarun Pathak, an as­so­ciate di­rec­tor with Coun­ter­point Re­search, said the game to re­place TikTok is about who pulls in the most in­flu­encers and how users re­act to an app’s fea­tures.</p>
    <p>TikTok was es­pe­cially pop­u­lar for its abil­ity to rec­om­mend videos match­ing user’s pref­er­ences and its easy-to-use edit­ing tools.</p>
    <p>“Creation of an app that can match TikTok will be very dif­fi­cult over a small amount of time, es­pe­cially for start-ups,” he noted.</p>
    <p>The ease of us­ing TikTok is what Ms Geetha Srid­har misses most.</p>
    <p>Ms Srid­har was widely fol­lowed for her recipes and tips on how to live well, and had a mil­lion fol­low­ers on the Chi­nese app.</p>
    <p>She has tried some of the In­dian al­ter­na­tives but they have left her un­im­pressed. She has grudg­ingly set­tled for an ac­count on Riz­zle, an In­dian-Amer­i­can app.</p>
    <p>“No one can beat TikTok,” Ms Srid­har, 54, told The Straits Times. “It’s my day, my lover, my boyfriend.”</p>
    <p>And like any faith­ful lover, Ms Srid­har awaits the day when TikTok may re­turn. “I still have 60 videos saved as drafts,” she said.</p>
