    <p>BEDMINSTER (NEW JERSEY) • Mr Robert Trump, the younger brother of United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and a busi­ness ex­ec­u­tive who avoided the spot­light, died on Satur­day night, a day after the Pres­i­dent vis­ited him in a New York hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Trump an­nounced the death in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“It is with a heavy heart I share that my won­der­ful brother Robert peace­fully passed away tonight. He was not just my brother, he was my best friend,” he said.</p>
    <p>“He will be greatly missed, but we will meet again. His mem­ory will live on in my heart for­ever. Robert, I love you. Rest in peace.”</p>
    <p>Mr Robert Trump, who at 71 was younger than the 74-year-old Pres­i­dent, was a busi­ness ex­ec­u­tive and real es­tate de­vel­oper. Un­like his re­al­ity TV star brother, Mr Robert Trump shunned the lime­light.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Trump made an emo­tional visit to see his ail­ing brother on Fri­day at New York-Pres­by­te­rian/Weill Cor­nell Med­i­cal Cen­tre be­fore go­ing to his golf club at Bedminster, New Jersey, for the week­end. The visit lasted just un­der an hour.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent was ex­pected to at­tend the fu­neral, an aide said. He has a busy travel sched­ule in the com­ing days with plans to visit four bat­tle­ground states as part of his re­elec­tion cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Al­though the cause of Mr Robert Trump’s death was not re­vealed, Pres­i­dent Trump told re­porters on Fri­day that his brother was “hav­ing a hard time” with an undis­closed ill­ness. Ac­cord­ing to a close friend of the fam­ily, Mr Robert Trump, who took blood thin­ners, had ex­pe­ri­enced brain bleeds that be­gan after a re­cent fall.</p>
    <p>ABC News had re­ported that Mr Robert Trump was hos­pi­talised in the in­ten­sive care unit at Mount Si­nai hos­pi­tal in New York in June.</p>
    <p>That month, Mr Robert Trump won a tem­po­rary re­strain­ing or­der against his and the Pres­i­dent’s niece Mary Trump to stop her from pub­lish­ing a tell-all book that of­fered an un­flat­ter­ing look of the Pres­i­dent and his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>A state supreme court judge in Pough­keep­sie, New York, later de­nied a re­quest to stop pub­li­ca­tion and can­celled the tem­po­rary re­strain­ing or­der.</p>
    <p>Mr Robert Trump had said the book, Too Much And Never Enough: How My Fam­ily Cre­ated The World’s Most Dan­ger­ous Man, would vi­o­late a con­fi­den­tial­ity agree­ment tied to the es­tate of his fa­ther Fred Trump Sr, who died in 1999.</p>
    <p>The New York Post re­ported in March that Mr Robert Trump had mar­ried his sec­ond wife Ann Marie Pal­lan, and that they lived in a coun­try home on Long Is­land.</p>
    <p>He had no chil­dren, but he helped to raise Mr Christo­pher Hol­lis­ter Trump-Retchin, the son of his first wife Blaine Trump, even giv­ing him his last name.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the Pres­i­dent and Ms Pal­lan, he is sur­vived by his sis­ters Maryanne Trump Barry and El­iz­a­beth Trump Grau. His brother Fred Trump Jr died in 1981.</p>
    <p>As the youngest of five chil­dren, Mr Robert Trump was shielded from some of the pres­sure ex­erted by his dis­ci­plinar­ian fa­ther over his older broth­ers. He was never groomed to take over the fam­ily real es­tate com­pany and was con­sid­ered by those who knew him to be the in­verse of the self-pro­mo­tional brother who even­tu­ally did.</p>
    <p>After grad­u­at­ing from Bos­ton Uni­ver­sity, he took a job on Wall Street but even­tu­ally went to work for his brother as a se­nior ex­ec­u­tive at the Trump Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“You could con­sider him the qui­etest of Trumps,” Mr Michael D’An­to­nio, a Trump bi­og­ra­pher, said. “He was glad to stay out of the spot­light.”</p>
    <p>Mr J ack O’Don­nell, a for­mer Trump Or­gan­i­sa­tion ex­ec­u­tive, re­called the younger Trump as some­one with a nat­u­ral ease and good hu­mour: “He had zero sense of en­ti­tle­ment.”</p>
    <p>Two of Pres­i­dent Trump’s chil­dren ex­pressed sad­ness about their un­cle’s death.</p>
    <p>“Robert Trump was an in­cred­i­ble man – strong, kind and loyal to the core. Any­one who en­coun­tered him felt his warmth im­me­di­ately. He will be deeply missed by our en­tire fam­ily,” Mr Eric Trump wrote.</p>
    <p>Ms Ivanka Trump tweeted: “Un­cle Robert, we love you. You are in our hearts and prayers, al­ways.”</p>
