    <p>Go ahead and call Paul Klein, front­man of Amer­i­can indie-pop trio Lany, a mama’s boy – he does not mind.</p>
    <p>In fact, the 32-year-old wel­comes it and has named the band’s new­est and third al­bum Mama’s Boy.</p>
    <p>“There’s a sen­si­tive and emo­tional kind of at­tach­ment to that phrase, you know,” he says in a re­cent Zoom in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>“If you’re a mama’s boy, you’re of­ten pretty in touch with your emo­tions. You’re pretty good at ar­tic­u­lat­ing your feel­ings.”</p>
    <p>Klein says he was trans­par­ent and vul­ner­a­ble when writ­ing songs for the band’s pre­vi­ous al­bum, Mal­ibu Nights (2018) – and 10 times more so when writ­ing the new al­bum’s songs.</p>
    <p>“They’re just not nec­es­sar­ily about break-ups,” he says. “It’s about re­al­life, day-to-day ex­pe­ri­ences and emo­tions, and grow­ing up.”</p>
    <p>While the band’s name is made up of the acro­nym of the two most well-known cities in the United States – Los An­ge­les and New York – Klein says the band were in­tent on get­ting in touch with their roots in mid­dle Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>“None of us are ac­tu­ally from LA. We live in LA, but we’re from the mid­dle of nowhere and I thought</p>
    <p>that’s re­ally im­por­tant.”</p>
    <p>Multi-in­stru­men­tal­ists Charles “Les” Priest and Jake Goss make up the rest of the band.</p>
    <p>Formed in 2014, Lany are known for hit songs ILYSB (2015), Mal­ibu Nights (2018) and last year’s col­lab­o­ra­tive sin­gles Okay, with Ju­lia Michaels; and Mean It, with Lauv.</p>
    <p>Klein de­scribes the lat­est sin­gle from the new al­bum, Cow­boy In LA, as a “fun, kind of quirky take” on the band mem­bers’ child­hoods in the states of Ok­la­homa, Arkansas and Mis­souri, where they grew up wear­ing cow­boy hats, and their even­tual re­lo­ca­tion to LA.</p>
    <p>The band have ex­panded on their sound – an amal­gam of pop, al­ter­na­tive rock, indie pop and synth pop – on the 14-song al­bum.</p>
    <p>Klein says: “There’s a lot of flavours on this al­bum. We’re do­ing some things we’ve never done be­fore.</p>
    <p>“We’ve never had acous­tic gui­tar on a sin­gle song ever, which is al­most hi­lar­i­ous to say, but now we have acous­tic gui­tar and you know all through­out the al­bum.”</p>
    <p>Be­cause of pan­demic-re­lated re­stric­tions, the band took longer than usual to fin­ish the record­ings.</p>
    <p>The al­bum was three-quar­ters done be­fore lock­down started in the US.</p>
    <p>“Things take so much longer via e-mail. So for a cou­ple months, we were try­ing to fin­ish the al­bum via e-mail, which is just su­per dif­fi­cult,” says Klein.</p>
    <p>“Fi­nally, we were able to get back into the stu­dio, just one of us at a time. And what we were able to get done in eight hours to­gether in the stu­dio, would take – I’m not kid­ding – prob­a­bly four weeks.”</p>
    <p>He misses play­ing phys­i­cal con­certs, some­thing the band used to do about 120 times a year.</p>
    <p>“It’s re­ally tough be­cause it’s when you go and play live that you re­ally feel like this whole thing is worth it. Be­cause you see how much it means to peo­ple, how much peo­ple are re­ally con­nect­ing with it on a per­sonal level. That’s a sense of val­i­da­tion that I’ve missed.”</p>
    <p>Re­leas­ing mu­sic on­line does not have the same ef­fect, he adds.</p>
    <p>“Right now, it’s like you work so hard, you throw a song on the In­ter­net and you’re like, ‘all right, hope you like it, see you later’.”</p>
    <p>Still, the lock­down has al­lowed Klein to spend more time work­ing on the band’s mer­chan­dise, such as de­sign­ing clothes cen­tred on the new al­bum’s sin­gles.</p>
    <p>“I love clothes, I al­ways have. I love de­sign and I’ve been very in­volved in the de­sign and the merch we do in this band. I just do it be­cause I love it.”</p>
