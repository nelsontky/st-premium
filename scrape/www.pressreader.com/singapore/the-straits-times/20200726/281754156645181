    <p>A lo­cally de­signed, cost-ef­fec­tive ven­ti­la­tor whose pro­duc­tion can be scaled up eas­ily is close to fruition.</p>
    <p>When avail­able, it can be used for Covid-19 pa­tients with milder symp­toms, so that con­ven­tional ven­ti­la­tors can be de­ployed for more se­vere cases.</p>
    <p>The in­no­va­tion will enable Sin­ga­pore to avoid a short­age of ven­ti­la­tors, a sit­u­a­tion which has oc­curred over­seas and which led to doc­tors there hav­ing to choose which pa­tients to treat.</p>
    <p>A team of clin­i­cians and en­gi­neers from SingHealth hos­pi­tals came up with the de­sign for the ven­ti­la­tor, known as SG-In­spire, which is meant to pro­vide breath­ing sup­port for Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The ven­ti­la­tor can be op­er­ated re­motely, an in­no­va­tive fea­ture that will enable health­care staff to mon­i­tor their pa­tients’ con­di­tions with­out hav­ing to en­ter their rooms as fre­quently, re­duc­ing the risks of vi­ral trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Cost­ing be­tween $7,000 and $9,000, the SG-In­spire is five times cheaper than a con­ven­tional ven­ti­la­tor.</p>
    <p>As it uses read­ily avail­able com­po­nents, the ven­ti­la­tor can be mass pro­duced quickly, within a month, com­ple­ment­ing the con­ven­tional ven­ti­la­tors should the need arise.</p>
    <p>The team be­gan the project in March, when Covid-19 cases sky­rock­eted both lo­cally and glob­ally. One of its aims was to de­vise a ven­ti­la­tor that can be mass pro­duced quickly, to avoid the sit­u­a­tion faced over­seas where med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als were forced to choose which pa­tients to treat.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, hos­pi­tals in north­ern Italy re­served their lim­ited sup­ply of ven­ti­la­tors for pa­tients un­der the age of 60, while some med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als in New York opted to pick pa­tients at ran­dom.</p>
    <p>The team from SingHealth has be­gun dis­cus­sions with in­sti­tu­tions in some Asean coun­tries iden­ti­fied as pos­si­ble mar­kets for the sale of its ven­ti­la­tors.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Der­rick Chan, di­rec­tor of the KK Re­search Cen­tre at KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal (KKH) and deputy di­rec­tor of the SingHealth Med­i­cal Tech­nol­ogy Of­fice, said yes­ter­day that the ven­ti­la­tor has un­der­gone rig­or­ous test­ing in ac­cor­dance with in­ter­na­tional stan­dards and will be fur­ther tested among clin­i­cians at SingHealth in­sti­tu­tions, start­ing with those at KKH and the Na­tional Heart Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Prof Chan, who is also the project lead for the in­no­va­tion, said that more pro­duc­tion pro­to­types – close to the fi­nal prod­uct – will be</p>
