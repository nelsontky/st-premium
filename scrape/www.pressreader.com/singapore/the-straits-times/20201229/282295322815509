    <p>MI­AMI • Greg Nor­man is back in hospi­tal in Florida after the Aus­tralian golf­ing great tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, the 65-year-old said late on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The for­mer world No. 1, whose two Ma­jor ti­tles came at the Bri­tish Open in 1986 and 1993, had said he tested neg­a­tive at the ex­hi­bi­tion PNC Cham­pi­onship in Or­lando from Dec 19-20 but be­gan to ex­pe­ri­ence fever, joint and mus­cle aches later in the week.</p>
    <p>He was ad­mit­ted on Christ­mas Day and re­turned home to self-iso­late on Satur­day while await­ing the results of an­other test, which turned out to be pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>“I hope this will be my fi­nal update on this Covid saga... back in hospi­tal after get­ting a pos­i­tive re­sult,” he said on In­sta­gram, adding he was re­ceiv­ing an in­fu­sion of an­ti­bod­ies. “The path to full re­cov­ery. Hop­ing to be out later to­day.”</p>
    <p>Nor­man, nick­named “The Great White Shark”, claimed that de­spite be­ing fit and strong and hav­ing a high tol­er­ance for pain, the “hideous” virus had “kicked the crap out of me like noth­ing I have ever ex­pe­ri­enced be­fore”.</p>
    <p>“Mus­cle and joint pain on an­other level. Headaches that feel like a chisel go­ing through your head scrap­ing lit­tle bits off each time, fever, mus­cles that just did not want to work,” he added.</p>
    <p>“Then my taste failed, where beer tastes bad and wine the same... at times, strug­gling with mem­ory of names and things. So please take care.”</p>
    <p>Nor­man’s son, also named Greg, who played with his fa­ther at the PNC Cham­pi­onship, had ear­lier con­firmed that he and his wife had tested pos­i­tive.</p>
