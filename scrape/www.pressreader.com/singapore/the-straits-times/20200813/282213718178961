    <p>At school in the 1950s and 1960s, I do not re­call my teach­ers rais­ing any is­sue re­gard­ing race or re­li­gion. At no time were we asked to dis­cuss or take note of any sen­si­tiv­i­ties among one an­other.</p>
    <p>It was the same in the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces. We de­vel­oped bonds dur­ing train­ing and while serv­ing in the army. No one had to or­ches­trate our be­hav­iour; we would min­gle seam­lessly, so much so that to­day, I still have friends from all races and we still meet oc­ca­sion­ally.</p>
    <p>In the 1970s and 1980s, my son and daugh­ter had dif­fer­ent ex­pe­ri­ences. Look­ing at their present friends and ac­quain­tances, com­pared with my cir­cle, there are fewer from the other races.</p>
    <p>This is de­spite more dis­cus­sions on race and re­li­gion in school and at work.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment has to plan and or­gan­ise ac­tiv­i­ties to get stu­dents, na­tional ser­vice­men and work­ers to in­ter­min­gle and be ed­u­cated on race and re­li­gious sen­si­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>I think is­sues over race and re­li­gion have in­creased over the years and the cur­rent state of affairs is quite sad. They even sur­faced in the re­cent elec­tions.</p>
    <p>So where have we gone wrong? How can we cor­rect this?</p>
    <p>We should avoid mak­ing of­fen­sive state­ments when ex­press­ing opin­ions dur­ing dis­cus­sions. Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore pres­i­dent Mo­ham­mad Alami Musa high­lighted three ways to help en­sure fair and open dis­cus­sions of race and re­li­gion (How to en­gage the young in race and re­li­gion dia­logues, Aug 8).</p>
    <p>This is a valu­able con­tri­bu­tion if we are to get back to seam­lessly liv­ing in a mul­tira­cial and multi-re­li­gious Sin­ga­pore.</p>
