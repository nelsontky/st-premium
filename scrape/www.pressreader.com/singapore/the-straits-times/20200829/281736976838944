    <p>Jobs and the economic im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic are set to dom­i­nate the week-long par­lia­men­tary de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress that starts on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The de­bate will see MPs dis­cussing the is­sues raised in the speech and scru­ti­n­is­ing the plans of the var­i­ous min­istries set out in the Ad­denda to the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress re­leased this week.</p>
    <p>In her ad­dress lay­ing out the Gov­ern­ment’s plans and pri­or­i­ties for its new term of of­fice, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob said jobs will re­main the top priority for the next few years.</p>
    <p>MPs have in­di­cated that con­cerns over jobs are fore­most on their res­i­dents’ minds as well.</p>
    <p>Mr Pa­trick Tay (Pi­o­neer) will be the first MP to speak and also round up the de­bate at the end of the week. The labour MP plans to speak on strength­en­ing the Sin­ga­porean core in the lo­cal work­force and on pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers and ex­ec­u­tives (PMEs).</p>
    <p>He said his speech will give an in­di­ca­tion of what he plans to fo­cus on at a new task force un­der the Na­tional Trades Union Congress that he is jointly lead­ing, to cham­pion the pro­tec­tion of lo­cal PMEs.</p>
    <p>“The terms of ref­er­ence and the scope of the task force are still be­ing worked out, but one key area of fo­cus would be supporting mid­ca­reer PMEs,” he told The Straits Times. “This could be through strength­en­ing the Sin­ga­porean core and en­abling this group to stay em­ployed and em­ploy­able.”</p>
    <p>Mr Des­mond Choo (Tampines GRC) said he will speak pri­mar­ily on sup­port for grad­u­ates en­ter­ing the job mar­ket be­tween last year and 2021. “They face a very un­cer­tain fu­ture. The ef­fects will last five to eight years and we will need to sup­port this gen­er­a­tion very dif­fer­ently,” he added.</p>
    <p>He also plans to speak on selfem­ployed per­sons, ask for ex­ten­sions to sup­port mea­sures and call on plat­form com­pa­nies to un­der­take greater re­spon­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Work­ers’ Party (WP) MP He Ting Ru (Sengkang GRC) said that in ad­di­tion to is­sues re­lat­ing to jobs, she also plans to speak on sustainabi­lity and sup­port for fam­i­lies in her maiden speech.</p>
    <p>Mr Louis Ng (Nee Soon GRC) said he will con­tinue to fo­cus on the im­por­tance of build­ing a car­ing and com­pas­sion­ate so­ci­ety, which was the theme of his maiden speech in 2016. Some of the top­ics he will touch on in­clude mak­ing work­places more in­clu­sive for women and moth­ers and mak­ing schools more in­clu­sive for spe­cial needs chil­dren.</p>
    <p>The de­bate will also see Prime</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong de­liver a ma­jor speech.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, sev­eral ad­min­is­tra­tive mat­ters will also be set­tled in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam (Nee Soon GRC) and Ms Joan Pereira (Tan­jong Pa­gar GRC) will take their oaths of al­le­giance dur­ing the sit­ting. They were not present when the other 91 MPs and two Non-Con­stituency MPs were sworn in ear­lier this week when Par­lia­ment re­opened.</p>
    <p>Leader of the House In­dra­nee Ra­jah will de­liver a Min­is­te­rial State­ment on the du­ties and priv­i­leges of the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion (LO) be­fore the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress be­gins.</p>
    <p>The LO is a newly es­tab­lished post held by WP chief Pri­tam Singh.</p>
    <p>The Com­mit­tee of Se­lec­tion will also be ap­pointed on Mon­day. It is chaired by Speaker Tan Chuan-Jin and is re­spon­si­ble for se­lect­ing MPs for Par­lia­ment’s var­i­ous other Se­lect Com­mit­tees.</p>
    <p>The com­mit­tee’s mem­bers have been named and com­prise Ms In­dra­nee (Tan­jong Pa­gar GRC), Dr Koh Poh Koon (Tampines GRC), Ms Denise Phua (Jalan Be­sar GRC), Mr Singh (Alju­nied GRC), Dr Tan See Leng (Marine Pa­rade GRC), Mr Ed­win Tong (Marine Pa­rade GRC) and Mr Zaqy Mo­hamad (Mar­sil­ing-Yew Tee GRC).</p>
