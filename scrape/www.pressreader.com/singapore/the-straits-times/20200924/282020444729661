    <p>I re­cently wrote that Face­book chief ex­ec­u­tive Mark Zucker­berg is the most pow­er­ful un­elected man in Amer­ica. His and the so­cial me­dia gi­ant’s ef­forts to try to com­bat election-re­lated dis­in­for­ma­tion on its plat­form, how­ever com­fort­ing, were merely “an ad­mis­sion of a great power that should make Amer­i­cans un­com­fort­able”, I said.</p>
    <p>Some read­ers ar­gued that I had it wrong. First, crit­i­cis­ing the help­ful ef­forts of Sil­i­con Val­ley is coun­ter­pro­duc­tive at a time when we need all hands on deck, they wrote. Sec­ond, I was too nar­rowly fo­cused on one man. Mr Zucker­berg and Face­book are far from the only pow­er­ful en­ti­ties who could, with a few ex­ec­u­tive de­ci­sions, mean­ing­fully af­fect the 2020 United States pres­i­den­tial election.</p>
    <p>In other words, what is no­table is how much power and in­flu­ence Amer­ica’s plu­to­crats have and how lit­tle they seem to be us­ing it.</p>
    <p>So, what could the tech giants and big busi­ness do to help se­cure a free and fair election, if they wanted to?</p>
    <p>Some ideas are sim­ple: Turn election day into a com­pany hol­i­day. Face­book re­cently took a ver­sion of this step, giv­ing paid time off to its tens of thou­sands of US em­ploy­ees to vote and to vol­un­teer as poll work­ers. It’s a mean­ing­ful step and one that all large com­pa­nies should adopt. Ap­ple, which has over</p>
    <p>90,000 US em­ploy­ees, did some­thing sim­i­lar, but of­fered em­ploy­ees only four hours of paid time off. With more than 500,000 full- and part-time US em­ploy­ees, Ama­zon, es­pe­cially, could take its cue from elec­tron­ics re­tailer Best Buy and roughly 1,000 other com­pa­nies that have pledged to give some time off to those who vol­un­teer to work at the polls.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies ought to go much fur­ther, mak­ing the day a com­pany hol­i­day. As non-profit me­dia or­gan­i­sa­tion Mar­ket­place re­ported in 2018, the day is al­ready a huge pro­duc­tiv­ity drain for Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>Plenty of work­ers sneak away from the of­fice to vote any­how. And the anx­i­eties and ex­cite­ments of the day are a dis­trac­tion. One es­ti­mate in 2018 from out­place­ment firm Chal­lenger, Gray & Christ­mas sug­gested that the election could cost the US econ­omy up to US$3.5 bil­lion (S$4.8 bil­lion) per hour.</p>
    <p>It’s a good ar­gu­ment to cut the losses al­to­gether and give peo­ple the space to ex­er­cise a fun­da­men­tal right of cit­i­zen­ship.</p>
    <p>Ride-hail­ing firms Uber and Lyft will of­fer dis­counts to those rid­ing to the polls, but they could do more to pri­ori­tise sub­sidised or free, safe rides to polling places. They could in­cen­tivise their con­tract work­ers to pick up in­di­vid­u­als in re­mote ar­eas by sub­si­dis­ing them for the trip out.</p>
    <p>An­other pos­si­bil­ity is to pair driv­ers with riders who have the same polling place, and, once they ar­rive, the com­pa­nies could pay for the driv­ers’ time as they wait to vote.</p>
    <p>Those are the straight­for­ward so­lu­tions. But, if we’re day­dream­ing, the op­tions are end­less.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies could pledge to pay for ad­e­quate per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment at all polling sta­tions for any­one who needs it.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft, Google, Mozilla and other browser builders could make use­ful vot­ing in­for­ma­tion and val­i­dated up­dates from sec­re­tary of state web­sites the de­fault home page in their browsers.</p>
    <p>Face­book’s election dash­board could re­place users’ home screens, forc­ing them to click away from it to en­gage with stan­dard news feeds or groups and pages. As re­turns come in on election night, that cru­cial In­ter­net real es­tate could be promi­nently dis­played all night with only val­i­dated election re­sults, of­fer­ing a sober look at “What we know” be­fore users have a chance to en­ter the chaotic frenzy of their al­go­rith­mic feeds.</p>
    <p>“Any­one who in­flu­ences your phys­i­cal or men­tal space, any­one who has the abil­ity to place news or con­tent in those spa­ces – or take it out – that’s real power,” Mr Aviv Ovadya, the founder of the Thought­ful Tech­nol­ogy Pro­ject, told me. “(Ama­zon’s) Jeff Be­zos has great in­flu­ence over our phys­i­cal space, while Mi­crosoft, Face­book, Ap­ple and oth­ers take up the phys­i­cal space on our screens.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ovadya was one of the peo­ple who sug­gested think­ing big­ger about tech’s in­flu­ence. He’s a thought­ful critic of Big Tech who also wants to in­cen­tivise the in­dus­try to make sys­temic changes.</p>
    <p>“Jeff Be­zos could prob­a­bly de­cide and then use his com­pany’s in­fra­struc­ture to help en­sure that mail-in bal­lots are re­li­ably de­liv­ered,” he said, though he ad­mit­ted it would be lo­gis­ti­cally tricky and, ar­guably, far too late for such an en­deav­our.</p>
    <p>“Tim Cook and Ap­ple could shove ‘I reg­is­tered to vote, on this site’ as a sug­gested mes­sage into iMes­sage, en­cour­ag­ing peo­ple to share it in natural con­ver­sa­tions with those you’re tex­ting.”</p>
    <p>He doesn’t want to limit par­tic­i­pa­tion to tech giants. He mused that most S&P 500 com­pa­nies could use their power to try to bake some sta­bil­ity into our cur­rently un­sta­ble pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>“Be­yond vot­ing,” Mr Ovadya said, “you could imag­ine the com­pa­nies com­ing to­gether with a pledge that oth­ers could sign that said some­thing to the ef­fect of ‘I agree up­front to abide by the re­sults of the election as cer­ti­fied by the Elec­toral</p>
    <p>Col­lege and Supreme Court’,” (a sce­nario that has grown even more com­pli­cated in re­cent days).</p>
    <p>Mr Ovadya’s ar­gu­ment is com­pelling. With ten­sions and anx­i­ety about po­ten­tial claims of voter fraud and post-election un­rest mount­ing, surely it makes sense to do any­thing pos­si­ble to en­sure a fair, free, trans­par­ent and uni­ver­sally ac­cepted election.</p>
    <p>Mr Ovadya notes that en­cour­ag­ing cor­po­rate in­volve­ment also has the added ben­e­fit of not alien­at­ing the na­tion’s most pow­er­ful un­elected in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>The scep­tic in me still bris­tles. I want a smooth and fair election as much as the next per­son, and yet any en­treaty feels a bit to me like beg­ging the per­son who pushed you into the deep end of the pool to save you from drown­ing.</p>
    <p>“We don’t need the bil­lion­aire class and the tech rob­ber barons to ask the ques­tion ‘What can I do for the coun­try?’,” Mr Anand Girid­haradas, au­thor of Win­ners Take All, told me re­cently.</p>
    <p>“They need to ask, ‘What have I been do­ing to the coun­try and what could I stop do­ing?’.” He ar­gued that our un­der­stand­able de­sire to have benev­o­lent bil­lion­aires and cor­po­ra­tions step in to help dur­ing pe­ri­ods of in­sta­bil­ity is part of an abu­sive re­la­tion­ship be­tween the plu­to­crats and the rest of us, and that their per­ceived hero­ics would only be ex­ploit­ing a mo­ment of weak­ness to fur­ther en­trench their power.</p>
    <p>But, in mo­ments of des­per­a­tion, it may be hard for anx­ious Amer­i­cans to hear that ar­gu­ment.</p>
    <p>I asked Mr Girid­haradas what he’d say to those will­ing to hold their nose and make the trade-off. “You are be­ing sold a fraud­u­lent prom­ise that the peo­ple who caused this mess can lead us out of it,” he said.</p>
    <p>“That the peo­ple most re­spon­si­ble for an age of in­equal­ity and col­laps­ing so­cial mo­bil­ity are our sal­va­tion. That the ar­son­ists of op­por­tu­nity in Amer­ica can come back as fire­fight­ers.”</p>
    <p>This is a de­bate about how to har­ness power at a crit­i­cal time.</p>
    <p>About whether Amer­i­cans should use the mo­ment to pres­sure power to ex­ert it­self for a favourable out­come for democ­racy or whether it’s more im­por­tant to use the mo­ment to dis­man­tle and de-cen­tre power (or whether that’s a false choice al­to­gether).</p>
    <p>And then there’s the pow­er­ful them­selves. It’s no­table that, given all the pos­si­ble ways Amer­ica’s elites could help se­cure a free and fair election, few have stepped up in a truly mean­ing­ful way.</p>
    <p>It takes courage to ac­cept help in a des­per­ate mo­ment. Just as it takes courage to turn away from tainted char­ity in a time of need. And, for those who have power, it takes courage to ex­pose it and ex­er­cise it for the greater good, rather than hide and con­serve it for one’s own ben­e­fit. To get through the next few months, we’ll need a lot of courage from ev­ery­one.</p>
