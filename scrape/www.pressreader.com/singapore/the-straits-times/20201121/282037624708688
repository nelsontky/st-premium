    <p>The United States has a new pres­i­dent-elect but the old di­vi­sions re­main. It may be even more di­vided now af­ter such a close and ugly elec­tion.</p>
    <p>For many of us watch­ing from afar, it was not easy to com­pre­hend what was tak­ing place.</p>
    <p>The US is look­ing more and more like a distant friend sep­a­rated from the rest for so long, it is now un­recog­nis­able.</p>
    <p>How to make sense of the deep class and racial di­vi­sions in the coun­try that ex­plode in the streets ev­ery now and then, and the de­struc­tive po­lit­i­cal par­ti­san­ship that makes these prob­lems im­pos­si­ble to re­solve?</p>
    <p>If this is Amer­i­can democ­racy, there should be so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules to keep it away from the rest of the world.</p>
    <p>Be­fore, you could sim­ply shrug your shoul­ders and say you re­ally do not un­der­stand US so­ci­ety and that per­haps it has a dif­fer­ent way of tack­ling its is­sues.</p>
    <p>But then the Covid-19 pan­demic struck, a com­mon en­emy you knew closely and whose spread you knew how to con­trol.</p>
    <p>That was when the US be­came in­com­pre­hen­si­ble to me, af­ter mask-wear­ing be­came a po­lit­i­cal is­sue, and the Pres­i­dent openly con­tra­dicted the ad­vice of health of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>But the world, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, can­not turn its back on the US – it needs to un­der­stand it be­cause the US has an out­sized role in de­ter­min­ing crit­i­cal is­sues that mat­ter to all of us, in­clud­ing its re­la­tion­ship with China, cli­mate change and the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den will be a dif­fer­ent leader from Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, but he will in­herit the same di­vided peo­ple torn apart by the same di­vi­sive is­sues.</p>
    <p>As many an­a­lysts have noted, the out­go­ing Pres­i­dent was not the cause of these deep di­vi­sions but its symp­tom. He may be go­ing but an­other leader will emerge from the peo­ple who sup­ported his cause, which if you go by the votes ob­tained, amounted to no less than 71 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>That’s an­other hard-to­com­pre­hend part of the US.</p>
    <p>Most Sin­ga­pore­ans I spoke to were root­ing for Mr Bi­den not be­cause they liked his views but they just wanted Pres­i­dent Trump out.</p>
    <p>They might not un­der­stand enough the pol­icy dif­fer­ences be­tween the two can­di­dates but had a big prob­lem with the moral char­ac­ter of the Pres­i­dent – he was a bully, played fast and loose with the facts, es­pe­cially over the pan­demic, and had no re­spect for women and mi­nori­ties.</p>
    <p>His words and ac­tions did not ac­cord with their sense of de­cency and moral­ity which they ex­pect of a leader, es­pe­cially of the world’s great­est su­per­power and a once lead­ing light of lib­eral democ­racy.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, Mr Bi­den, ac­cord­ing to sev­eral re­ports, won not be­cause of pol­icy but who he was as a per­son.</p>
    <p>His was a life­long ser­vice in pol­i­tics – quite a jour­ney from one of the youngest sen­a­tors at the time when he was only 29 years old to now the old­est elected pres­i­dent at 77.</p>
    <p>But it was marred by per­sonal tragedy when a car ac­ci­dent killed his young wife and one-year-old daugh­ter in 1972, and he was left alone to raise his two sons.</p>
    <p>Trag­i­cally, he would lose one of them, Beau, to brain can­cer in 2015.</p>
    <p>Grief-stricken by the loss, he de­clared he would not run for of­fice af­ter then Pres­i­dent Barack Obama’s term ended in 2016.</p>
    <p>But he changed his mind fol­low­ing the Trump years, and would later re­veal that it was his dy­ing son’s wish for his fa­ther to con­tinue serv­ing the coun­try.</p>
    <p>De­spite the two can­di­dates be­ing so dif­fer­ent in char­ac­ter, Mr Bi­den did not de­liver the knock­out blow that many had ex­pected.</p>
    <p>Why wasn’t char­ac­ter the de­ci­sive fac­tor in the con­test, es­pe­cially when one can­di­date ap­pears to be so lack­ing in it?</p>
    <p>There might be many rea­sons and the Trump cam­paign did try to ham­mer away at the al­leged cor­rup­tion of Mr Bi­den’s son, Hunter, over busi­ness deal­ings in Ukraine.</p>
    <p>Per­haps enough Amer­i­cans be­lieve there wasn’t that much day­light be­tween the two as far as moral scru­ples go.</p>
    <p>But I be­lieve the more im­por­tant rea­son is that when peo­ple are di­vided and feel so strongly about is­sues that they de­monise their op­po­nent as a re­sult, they will over­look their own can­di­date’s moral flaws.</p>
    <p>Win­ning at all costs be­comes the only ob­jec­tive be­cause you are so afraid of los­ing.</p>
    <p>Lis­ten­ing to what both sides say about each other, it is clear the US has reached this point.</p>
    <p>The feel­ings in both camps are in­tense be­cause their dif­fer­ences are not over pol­icy but iden­tity: What sort of Amer­ica do you want? Open to im­mi­grants be­cause di­ver­sity is to be nur­tured and cel­e­brated? Or not so open be­cause you want to pre­serve white tra­di­tional val­ues? More power to in­di­vid­u­als and lo­cal com­mu­nity ac­tors or to big gov­ern­ment in Wash­ing­ton?</p>
    <p>This cul­ture war has been go­ing on for years now and will in­ten­sify un­less lead­ers of strong moral char­ac­ter, who are able to look be­yond their nar­row sec­tar­ian in­ter­ests, emerge.</p>
    <p>The good news is that at mo­ments of great cri­sis, peo­ple tend to look for such uni­fy­ing fig­ures to lead them out of peril.</p>
    <p>Per­haps – and this might be the most gen­er­ous in­ter­pre­ta­tion of the elec­tion re­sult – enough Amer­i­cans did do so to tip the scales for Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>There is a les­son for Sin­ga­pore. Pol­i­tics here is likely to be­come more com­pet­i­tive, and elec­tions more con­tentious.</p>
    <p>There is noth­ing wrong with this, and it is a nat­u­ral out­come in a ma­tur­ing democ­racy.</p>
    <p>Out of the con­tes­ta­tion of ideas, more rep­re­sen­ta­tive so­lu­tions might be found that work for the coun­try.</p>
    <p>But if it be­comes too di­vi­sive be­cause the is­sues are over iden­tity and cul­ture, the out­come might not be so dif­fer­ent from what has hap­pened in the US.</p>
    <p>For Sin­ga­pore, iden­tity is­sues could be over race, lan­guage, im­mi­gra­tion or class.</p>
    <p>Never say never – that it will not hap­pen here.</p>
    <p>When peo­ple are di­vided over iden­tity, they will fol­low a leader who fights for their cause, never mind his moral char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>It can hap­pen to both the rul­ing party and the op­po­si­tion. Nei­ther is immune from these ten­den­cies.</p>
    <p>A gov­ern­ment in power that is afraid it might lose an elec­tion can eas­ily sow dis­cord and dis­trust among the peo­ple to pre­serve its hold on power.</p>
    <p>A sil­ver-tongued op­po­si­tion leader might do the same thing to dis­credit the gov­ern­ment of the day.</p>
    <p>The best way to pre­vent it from hap­pen­ing is for the peo­ple to de­velop the where­withal to know and un­der­stand what is right for the coun­try, to think crit­i­cally for them­selves and not to fol­low oth­ers blindly.</p>
    <p>Strength­en­ing civil so­ci­ety is one way of achiev­ing this be­cause it forges a greater sense of com­mu­nity among the peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Most crit­i­cally, to de­velop a po­lit­i­cal cul­ture which places the high­est pre­mium on lead­ers with moral char­ac­ter, con­vic­tion and com­mit­ment.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore was for­tu­nate that its found­ing lead­ers were men with these qual­i­ties who led by ex­am­ple and were seen as one with the peo­ple, not apart and sep­a­rated.</p>
    <p>It has of­ten been said they were prag­ma­tists and in­ter­ested in only what worked and de­liv­ered re­sults, and that the coun­try’s progress was a re­sult of that prag­ma­tism.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve this is mis­taken.</p>
    <p>They might have been prac­ti­cal peo­ple, but they were driven first and fore­most by what they be­lieved in, which was to build a fair and just so­ci­ety, com­mit­ted to mak­ing Sin­ga­pore suc­ceed as an in­de­pen­dent na­tion.</p>
    <p>Lead­ers must have strong char­ac­ter shaped by a moral pur­pose to serve the peo­ple.</p>
    <p>In a di­vided world, these qual­i­ties mat­ter more than ever.</p>
    <p>A gov­ern­ment in power that is afraid it might lose an elec­tion can eas­ily sow dis­cord and dis­trust among the peo­ple to pre­serve its hold on power. A sil­ver-tongued op­po­si­tion leader might do the same thing to dis­credit the gov­ern­ment of the day. The best way to pre­vent it from hap­pen­ing is for the peo­ple to de­velop the where­withal to know and un­der­stand what is right for the coun­try, to think crit­i­cally for them­selves and not to fol­low oth­ers blindly.</p>
