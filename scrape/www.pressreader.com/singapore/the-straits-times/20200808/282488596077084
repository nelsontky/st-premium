    <p>An avid trav­eller who works in the travel in­dus­try, Mr Seann Chua has come across nu­mer­ous beau­ti­ful Euro­pean homes with Vic­to­rian in­te­ri­ors dur­ing his trips.</p>
    <p>“I find the wain­scot­ing, wall bead­ings and cor­nices rather en­chant­ing and wanted to have these in our home,” he says.</p>
    <p>How­ever, his wife, Ms Sh­eryl Kang, had some ini­tial reser­va­tions be­cause she did not want their three-bed­room con­do­minium unit in Pater­son Road to look like an old­fash­ioned Vic­to­rian abode.</p>
    <p>“I did some re­search and re­alised that we could go for a mod­ern Vic­to­rian style, which is more sub­tle and classy,” says the le­gal coun­sel with a me­dia com­pany.</p>
    <p>Be­sides work­ing with in­te­rior de­sign con­sul­tant James Kong from Car­pen­ters De­sign Group on the look of their apart­ment, the cou­ple, who are in their 30s, also sourced most of the fur­ni­ture and fit­tings them­selves. They say: “We knew ex­actly what style and colour we were look­ing for to com­ple­ment the mod­ern Vic­to­rian theme, so we were very fo­cused in our search.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing es­tab­lished a mod­ern Vic­to­rian theme with a black-and­white pal­ette for the liv­ing and din­ing spa­ces, they looked for el­e­ments that fit into the scheme for the 1,459 sq ft apart­ment – start­ing with the wain­scot­ing on white walls.</p>
    <p>Be­sides pick­ing a slim­mer pro­file in keep­ing with a more mod­ern look, their ver­sion is made from a spe­cial type of Euro­pean foam in­stead of wood. The foam al­lows for a more seam­less joint against the wall sur­face to min­imise un­sightly gaps.</p>
    <p>Ms Kang says: “The wain­scot­ing alone cost US$10,000 (S$13,700), but the re­sults are beau­ti­ful.”</p>
    <p>The liv­ing room is sparsely fur­nished, but the lone Ch­ester­field sofa – the cou­ple’s favourite piece in the home – makes a bold state­ment with its hand-dis­tressed Vagabond black leather. It was rein­vented for the mod­ern cen­tury by Bri­tish fur­ni­ture la­bel Ti­mothy Oul­ton, but re­tains the clas­si­cal pro­por­tions.</p>
    <p>The mar­ble floor­ing in the liv­ing and din­ing ar­eas was re­tained as well. But as the own­ers wanted a seam­less tran­si­tion into the dry kitchen, they tracked down the com­pany which supplied the orig­i­nal mar­ble for the de­vel­op­ment 14 years ago and bought the same mar­ble to be used in the dry kitchen.</p>
    <p>The old kitchen cab­i­nets gave way to new ones clad in sim­ple white lam­i­nate, with gold han­dles and knobs to ad­here to the mod­ern Vic­to­rian lan­guage.</p>
    <p>The bar counter be­tween the din­ing area and kitchen was re­placed with full-height cab­i­nets for ad­di­tional stor­age. Suit­cases are stowed in the lower cab­i­nets and the shelves fac­ing the din­ing area dis­play pho­tos of the cou­ple’s jour­ney – from be­ing new­ly­weds to par­ents of four-yearold Sum­mer and two-year-old Scott.</p>
    <p>In line with the cou­ple’s wishes, Mr Kong cre­ated a smart home where they can seam­lessly operate the lights, blinds and other house­hold ap­pli­ances.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple, who moved in in March last year af­ter a five-month, $100,000 ren­o­va­tion, say: “Our home re­flects our mod­ern life­style, aes­thet­ics and pref­er­ence for smart fea­tures. Most im­por­tantly, it is cosy and com­fort­able.”</p>
