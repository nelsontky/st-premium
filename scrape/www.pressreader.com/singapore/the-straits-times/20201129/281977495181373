    <p>The hos­pi­tal is no con­ven­tional lo­ca­tion for wed­ding shoots, but it is a place that bears great sig­nif­i­cance for Ms Ar­tika Raemi, 26, and Mr Aziz Ab­dul­lah, 28.</p>
    <p>The chemo­ther­apy bay at the Na­tional Univer­sity Can­cer In­sti­tute, Sin­ga­pore, was where Mr Aziz sup­ported his fi­ancee through her breast can­cer jour­ney.</p>
    <p>Ms Ar­tika, who is a nurse, was di­ag­nosed with breast can­cer in Au­gust 2018.</p>
    <p>She un­der­went a mas­tec­tomy in Septem­ber that year and started chemo­ther­apy that De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Her treat­ment ended in April last year, and she has since re­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>“It was not un­til I got on the op­er­at­ing ta­ble (for my mas­tec­tomy) that I re­alised I was go­ing to lose a part of me that makes me a woman. It was in­cred­i­bly dif­fi­cult, and I could not look at my­self in the mir­ror for a long while.”</p>
    <p>It is rare for young women like Ms Ar­tika to be di­ag­nosed with breast can­cer, and women un­der 30 ac­count for less than 5 per cent of all breast can­cer cases.</p>
    <p>Through­out Ms Ar­tika’s months of chemo­ther­apy, Mr Aziz, who is a teacher, kept her com­pany while look­ing through his stu­dents’ work.</p>
    <p>“The place now serves as a re­minder of how we over­came our tough­est phase of our re­la­tion­ship to­gether. Though it’s a place I don’t wish to visit as a pa­tient again, it’s some­where I never want to for­get,” Ms Ar­tika said.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple, who took their pic­tures yes­ter­day, will get mar­ried on June 12 next year.</p>
