    <p>Lim­ited pilot pro­grammes are be­ing con­sid­ered to help the nightlife in­dus­try re­open safely.</p>
    <p>Re­veal­ing this at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, the mul­ti­min­istry task force tack­ling Covid-19 cau­tioned that busi­nesses such as bars, pubs, karaoke lounges and night­clubs may still not be able to re­open any time soon.</p>
    <p>“We are pre­pared to con­sider pi­lots in some of th­ese set­tings with much more strin­gent safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place,” said Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, co-chair of the task force.</p>
    <p>“We will dis­cuss with the nightlife in­dus­try how some of th­ese pi­lots can take place and what are some of the more strin­gent con­di­tions.”</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the few, lim­ited pilot schemes be­ing con­sid­ered will be sub­ject to a more strin­gent set of mea­sures, in­clud­ing pre-en­try test­ing done us­ing anti­gen rapid tests.</p>
    <p>But Mr Wong warned that the nightlife in­dus­try is un­likely to be able to re­open or go back to what it used to be any time soon.</p>
    <p>The in­dus­try has to be pre­pared for “quite a long pe­riod of re­stric­tions be­ing in place”, he said, adding that the Gov­ern­ment will put in place mea­sures to help busi­ness op­er­a­tors and own­ers exit, tran­sit and pivot to new ar­eas. De­tails of the as­sis­tance pack­age will be an­nounced sep­a­rately, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong noted that in nightlife spots like bars or clubs, peo­ple are so­cial­is­ing in close prox­im­ity to one an­other within an en­closed space.</p>
    <p>“We’ve seen it in many other coun­tries where large clus­ters break out in th­ese sorts of set­tings. So, even at the start of phase three, when we en­ter phase three, we do not ex­pect to re­open th­ese or re­sume th­ese ac­tiv­i­ties any time soon,” he said.</p>
    <p>On why cruises are per­mit­ted and karaoke is not, Mr Wong noted that the na­ture of the ac­tiv­ity is dif­fer­ent – as is the abil­ity of op­er­a­tors to en­sure com­pli­ance. He said: “The na­ture of the ac­tiv­ity in it­self – whether it’s singing, danc­ing, if in a room with loud mu­sic where you’re pro­ject­ing your voice loudly – th­ese are ac­tiv­i­ties known to be of higher risk and to be supersprea­der events.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, two cruise lines were given the green light to of­fer “cruises to nowhere” from Sin­ga­pore start­ing next month, af­ter safety guide­lines were de­vel­oped to pre­vent a virus spread on board.</p>
    <p>All cruise lines must be au­dited and re­ceive CruiseSafe cer­ti­fi­ca­tion to sail out of Sin­ga­pore. There must be in­fec­tion con­trol mea­sures at ev­ery stage of a pas­sen­ger’s jour­ney, in­clud­ing a manda­tory Covid-19 test prior to board­ing and 100 per cent fresh air through­out the ship.</p>
    <p>Ship ca­pac­ity must also be re­duced to en­able safe dis­tanc­ing. Mea­sures on board must dis­cour­age close con­tact and in­ter­min­gling be­tween groups of pas­sen­gers. Emer­gency re­sponse plans must also be in place for Covid-19 in­ci­dents.</p>
