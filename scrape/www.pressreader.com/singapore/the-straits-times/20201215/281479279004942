    <p>To cruise amid a pan­demic is to brace our­selves for the worst-case sce­nario – a Covid-19 clus­ter on board, a va­ca­tion cut short, an un­timely quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Yet it is also the fur­thest get­away pos­si­ble dur­ing th­ese times, a chance to feel free and small, dwarfed by na­ture, the very things peo­ple travel to pur­sue.</p>
    <p>Dig­ging my suit­case out of stor­age and al­most-for­got­ten pass­port out of a drawer brings a fris­son of ex­cite­ment. Even pass­ing through im­mi­gra­tion and se­cu­rity at the Ma­rina Bay Cruise Cen­tre is novel, rather than a chore.</p>
    <p>Af­ter al­most a year of no travel and months of sim­u­lat­ing va­ca­tions at home, many in Singapore feel the same.</p>
    <p>Royal Caribbean’s Quan­tum of the Seas, which I was re­cently on, is one of two ships pi­lot­ing a safe cruis­ing pro­gramme that kicked off last month. It is 99 per cent booked for the rest of the year.</p>
    <p>But cruis­ing is not with­out risk, as the de­ba­cle last week on Quan­tum of the Seas has shown.</p>
    <p>Last Wed­nes­day, on the third morn­ing of a four-day cruise to nowhere, the ship re­turned to Singapore a day early af­ter a pas­sen­ger on board tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Although the test turned out to be a false pos­i­tive, it is un­nerv­ing to come within striking dis­tance of a virus we have spent most of this year try­ing to keep at bay.</p>
    <p>Be­ing iso­lated in my cabin for the day, like all other guests on board, of­fers the tini­est glimpse of be­ing quar­an­tined, com­plete with the req­ui­site un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>How long will this last? Are there more un­de­tected cases lurk­ing?</p>
    <p>My state­room comes with a bal­cony, the fresh air a wel­come change. Like clock­work, staff de­liver break­fast, lunch and din­ner, com­plete with sides and even dessert. The fare is noth­ing to shout about, but it is sus­te­nance and a dis­trac­tion un­til we fi­nally dis­em­bark, with the last pas­sen­gers leav­ing the ship at around mid­night for an anti­gen rapid test con­ducted at the cruise cen­tre.</p>
    <p>It is not the first pan­demic sail­ing to be cut short. Last month, the SeaDream I turned back to Bar­ba­dos dur­ing a Caribbean cruise to nowhere, af­ter at least five pas­sen­gers tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>But pas­sen­gers who spoke to The Straits Times were un­de­terred.</p>
    <p>En­tre­pre­neur Ian Lin, on his third Royal Caribbean cruise with friends and fam­ily, says he en­joyed the smaller crowds and shorter queues for ac­tiv­i­ties such as surf sim­u­la­tor FlowRider.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 1,680 pas­sen­gers were on board the cruise, less than half the ship’s ca­pac­ity of about 4,900 guests.</p>
    <p>Mr Lin, who is in his 30s, will be go­ing ahead with an­other cruise on Gent­ing’s World Dream at the end of the year.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, flight stew­ard Leon Chen, 31, who trav­elled with his girl­friend, says: “We are con­fi­dent of the safety mea­sures put in place and we un­der­stand that if you want to board a cruise ship, there is a risk that you have to take.”</p>
    <p>Quan­tum of the Seas may have scaled down some of the fun – gone are the pa­rades, dance par­ties and sports tour­na­ments – but there is still plenty to keep guests oc­cu­pied.</p>
    <p>The North Star (US$20, S$27), an ob­ser­va­tion cap­sule that el­e­vates us al­most 100m, makes our be­he­moth ves­sel look tiny. This is no mere lift ride. Up high, the cap­sule sways a lit­tle, a com­bi­na­tion of the wind and the roll of the sea.</p>
    <p>Rock climb­ing, too, is made trick­ier by the el­e­ments. From be­low, the routes look be­nign, but when perched on tiny climb­ing holds mid­way up, I feel ev­ery inch of the ship’s tilt. Each time I reach higher, the wind threat­ens to undo my pre­car­i­ous grip.</p>
    <p>Yet it is thrilling to feel so ex­posed, to be caught and low­ered gen­tly by an auto-be­lay sys­tem when I slip and tum­ble off the wall, and glimpse the hori­zon on my de­scent.</p>
    <p>There are other ac­tiv­i­ties too, such as the FlowRider, where pas­sen­gers ride a body board on an end­less sheet of rush­ing water.</p>
    <p>Be­hind, oth­ers spin, whirl and try to stay aloft in the RipCord by iFly (US$40), an indoor skydiving tun­nel.</p>
    <p>In the Seaplex, an indoor ac­tiv­ity area, guests whizz and dodge on bumper cars. It all feels like be­ing on a huge, float­ing amuse­ment park.</p>
    <p>Then there are the in­tan­gi­ble things, the sense of pos­si­bil­ity that comes with be­ing abroad and un­fet­tered. Free from the de­mands of daily life, peo­ple are more re­laxed, more open to con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>In the queue for the FlowRider, I meet a group of friends who of­fer tried-and-tested tips for how to avoid wip­ing out.</p>
    <p>Sea­soned cruis­ers, they let me in on their favourite place on board – the adults-only So­lar­ium, with whirlpools, deck chairs and a bar un­der a glass canopy at the ship’s bow.</p>
    <p>On my way to din­ner, a woman en­ters the lift sparkling, from her rhine­stone-stud­ded mask to a black se­quinned dress and gold, glit­tery shoes. Our eyes meet and I smile.</p>
    <p>“Is this too much?” she asks. “You’re on va­ca­tion,” I say. “Go all out.”</p>
    <p>SAFELY DIS­TANCED HOLIDAY</p>
    <p>Those look­ing to es­cape itin­er­ary plan­ning, es­sen­tial with a mul­ti­c­ity va­ca­tion, will find that cruis­ing is not quite the free-and-easy trip it used to be.</p>
    <p>Most things, in­clud­ing meal reser­va­tions, shows and ac­tiv­i­ties, must be booked ahead on the Royal Caribbean app so that crowds can be man­aged.</p>
    <p>Even a night­cap takes fore­thought – catch a late show and you might miss the cut­off time of 10pm, when bars stop serv­ing al­co­hol.</p>
    <p>Staff work swiftly as the cur­few looms, but the new reg­u­la­tions leave some guests cold.</p>
    <p>At the Harp and Horn bar on the first night, there are raised voices when pa­trons in line are un­able to get their drinks be­fore the till closes.</p>
    <p>“For some re­peat guests, they ex­pect that things will go back to the way they were be­fore the pan­demic,” says cruise direc­tor Bobby Brown.</p>
    <p>But there are rules and ev­ery­one, from crew to guests, must adapt. With smaller crowds al­lowed at per­for­mance venues – only 250 guests, down from over a thou­sand – the ap­plause sounds thin dur­ing a magic show and com­edy jug­gling act.</p>
    <p>Dance cap­tain and per­former Ma­rina Stacey, used to feed­ing off the crowd’s en­ergy, ad­mits this took some get­ting used to. Gone are the days of rous­ing cheers from a packed theatre. Masked up on­stage, a smoul­der­ing gaze and the shimmy of her shoul­ders must re­place fa­cial ex­pres­sions and a megawatt smile.</p>
    <p>Still, just be­ing on­stage is a tri­umph af­ter months at home in Van­cou­ver, where the 30-year-old spent most of this year tak­ing dance classes on­line to keep her­self in the best phys­i­cal shape pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>For the crew, this cruise is a chance to rise to the oc­ca­sion. Get safety mea­sures right and the ship could be a pro­to­type for other ves­sels around the world. This means more jobs to go around, a re­prieve for crew mem­bers who have gone months with­out work.</p>
    <p>So it is un­der­stand­able, the fer­vour with which they en­force safe dis­tanc­ing reg­u­la­tions, po­litely and apolo­get­i­cally, but al­ways with a firm hand.</p>
    <p>“Please stand 1m apart,” I hear through­out the ship – at the casino, bar and in line for ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>At Won­der­land, which spe­cialises in imag­i­na­tive cui­sine such as gaz­pa­cho served in test tubes topped with bread foam and boiled eggs with pureed yolks served un­der a dome of smoke, a server ex­cuses her­self amid tak­ing our or­der to en­sure that groups at sep­a­rate ta­bles do not min­gle.</p>
    <p>And at Jamie’s Ital­ian, where the meat plat­ters are ex­ten­sive and the pas­tas hearty, groups of guests are well-spaced through­out the eatery.</p>
    <p>There are other mea­sures too, a sur­feit of cau­tion to keep guests safe. We wear watch-like Tracelets on our wrists for move­ment track­ing and safe dis­tanc­ing, keep masks on and sani­tise our hands at sta­tions around the ship.</p>
    <p>Are th­ese enough? Can any amount of reg­u­la­tions guard against the most in­sid­i­ous virus of our times? For now, the safe cruis­ing pi­lot con­tin­ues.</p>
    <p>It will not be for ev­ery­one. There are doubt­less those who have been spooked by this episode. But ev­ery trip abroad is a cal­cu­lated risk, a chance to ex­pe­ri­ence the magic of travel that has so long eluded us. Take a chance on a cruise, and you might just find that at sea.</p>
