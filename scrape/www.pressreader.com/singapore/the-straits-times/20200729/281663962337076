    <p>The move to give Work­ers’ Party chief Pri­tam Singh more du­ties and priv­i­leges as the of­fi­cially des­ig­nated Leader of the Op­po­si­tion (LO) is a sig­nif­i­cant step to in­sti­tu­tion­alise the role of the op­po­si­tion, ob­servers said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But al­though the move re­flects the ma­tur­ing po­lit­i­cal sys­tem and raises ex­pec­ta­tions of the op­po­si­tion, it is un­likely to dras­ti­cally change the op­po­si­tion’s role in prac­tice, they added.</p>
    <p>Mr Leonard Lim, the coun­try di­rec­tor for Sin­ga­pore at public pol­icy con­sul­tancy Vriens and Part­ners, said giv­ing the LO the right of first re­sponse on a Bill or par­lia­men­tary mo­tion is sig­nif­i­cant, as the re­sponse could set the di­rec­tion and con­tent for the en­su­ing de­bate.</p>
    <p>He noted that typ­i­cally, the chair­man of the re­spec­tive Gov­ern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee (GPC) would give the first re­ply, with op­po­si­tion MPs speak­ing af­ter­wards.</p>
    <p>GPCs, which con­sist of Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) MPs, were mooted by then Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Goh Chok Tong in 1987 to scru­ti­nise leg­is­la­tion and pro­grammes of the var­i­ous min­istries and serve as an ad­di­tional chan­nel of feed­back on gov­ern­ment poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Lim: “Let­ting Pri­tam speak first may be seen as a leap of faith on the PAP’s part, but it in­di­cates they truly want to hear the al­ter­na­tives Pri­tam and the op­po­si­tion may have on a pol­icy.”</p>
    <p>For­mer PAP MP In­der­jit Singh, who re­tired from pol­i­tics in 2015, said raised ex­pec­ta­tions could work against the op­po­si­tion if it fails to de­liver ideas and al­ter­na­tives of the ex­pected qual­ity. He saw the move as more of a sym­bolic ges­ture that will not sig­nif­i­cantly change the way Par­lia­ment works in the im­me­di­ate fu­ture, given that the op­po­si­tion pres­ence is still small.</p>
    <p>The for­mer Ang Mo Kio GRC MP added that de­spite the ex­tra re­sources given to the LO, op­po­si­tion MPs will still have to come up with qual­ity ideas them­selves as the sum of money al­lo­cated will not be enough to “hire peo­ple who could help come up with ideas that can match that pro­duced by the civil ser­vice that is well staffed and well re­sourced”.</p>
    <p>“The real im­pact will be when there are enough op­po­si­tion MPs to form a shadow Cabi­net, but it is the first step in the right di­rec­tion as we have to be pre­pared for the day when a gov­ern­ment will be formed with­out the PAP in power,” said Mr In­der­jit Singh, adding that the move is none­the­less a sig­nif­i­cant first step to­wards a two-party sys­tem.</p>
    <p>A shadow Cabi­net led by the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion is a fea­ture of other West­min­ster Par­lia­ments. It typ­i­cally con­sists of op­po­si­tion MPs who take on the roles of “shadow min­is­ters”, mir­ror­ing the mem­bers of the ac­tual Cabi­net in or­der to scru­ti­nise the gov­ern­ment’s poli­cies and of­fer al­ter­na­tives such as a “shadow Bud­get”.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity law don Eu­gene Tan said the evo­lu­tion of the LO role will likely be an area of con­tes­ta­tion in the next five years.</p>
    <p>He noted the PAP has said thrice that it is not enough for the op­po­si­tion to just ask ques­tions and crit­i­cise the Gov­ern­ment’s pol­icy; it must also present se­ri­ous al­ter­na­tives to be scru­ti­nised and de­bated.</p>
    <p>In turn, Mr Pri­tam Singh has re­sponded, say­ing that ask­ing the Gov­ern­ment ques­tions re­mains the “fun­da­men­tal role” of a re­spon­si­ble op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Tan said: “You have the Gov­ern­ment try­ing to mould the op­po­si­tion in terms of what its role is and what the ex­pec­ta­tions are, but you also have the op­po­si­tion re­sist­ing and, in turn, want­ing to mould the of­fice and role in the way that works best for them.</p>
    <p>“The next five years will be in­ter­est­ing be­cause this is a new of­fice, and be­sides con­test­ing over poli­cies and pro­posed laws, you prob­a­bly will also have this con­tes­ta­tion over the evo­lu­tion of this of­fice.”</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Chong Ja Ian of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) said the for­mal­i­sa­tion of the LO role ad­dresses the elec­torate’s de­sire for an op­po­si­tion that will not only be able to bet­ter ful­fil its review and over­sight roles, but also rep­re­sent per­spec­tives held by a mi­nor­ity. “Af­ter all, an­other key role for a par­lia­men­tary op­po­si­tion is to en­sure that mi­nor­ity po­si­tions re­ceive ad­e­quate con­sid­er­a­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Suf­fi­cient pro­tec­tion of mi­nor­ity po­si­tions is what pre­vents tyranny of the ma­jor­ity and en­cour­ages con­tin­ued par­tic­i­pa­tion in the po­lit­i­cal process by those holding mi­nor­ity po­si­tions on var­i­ous is­sues,” he added. “In some re­spects, this is recog­ni­tion of an in­creas­ingly ma­ture Sin­ga­pore polity.”</p>
    <p>Prof Chong added that Sin­ga­pore has tended to adopt a ma­jori­tar­ian ap­proach to var­i­ous is­sues, which may not ad­e­quately re­flect the range of con­cerns in a plu­ral so­ci­ety that is “only go­ing to be­come more plu­ral go­ing for­ward”.</p>
    <p>NUS’ As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Bil­veer Singh said des­ig­nat­ing Mr Pri­tam Singh as LO is a vic­tory for Sin­ga­porean vot­ers, who have “got their wish at last” af­ter con­tin­u­ously elect­ing op­po­si­tion can­di­dates to Par­lia­ment since the 1980s.</p>
    <p>“Now, more than ever be­fore, the op­po­si­tion will have to per­form and demon­strate that it has the in­tel­lec­tual ca­pa­bil­ity, po­lit­i­cal skills and guts to take on the Gov­ern­ment which has a land­slide ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment with 83 out of the 93 seats.”</p>
