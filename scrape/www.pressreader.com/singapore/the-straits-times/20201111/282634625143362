    <p>No plane, no prob­lem.</p>
    <p>In­stead of tuck­ing into cat­tle-class fod­der at 10,000m up, I am din­ing on dishes from Sin­ga­pore Air­lines’ (SIA) First Class, Miche­lin-sprin­kled menu, while cruis­ing at a mere 100m above ground in a cable car.</p>
    <p>As some­one who only ever pays for econ­omy flights, this hosted ex­pe­ri­ence, SIA First Class Din­ing on Cable Car Sky Din­ing, is a look at how the other half lives.</p>
    <p>The meals are de­signed by chefs from SIA’s global culi­nary panel – Ge­orges Blanc of Restau­rant Ge­orges Blanc in France, which has three Miche­lin stars; celebrity chef Matt Mo­ran of Aria in Aus­tralia; and Yoshi­hiro Mu­rata of three-Miche­lin-starred Kikunoi in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers grounded by Covid-19 with air miles to burn, the tar­get au­di­ence, can choose from dates start­ing from Nov 20.</p>
    <p>The col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween the na­tional car­rier and One Faber Group – which man­ages pro­grammes like Cable Car Sky Din­ing, as well as restau­rants on Mount Faber – is avail­able only for fre­quent fliers who have at least 65,000 miles on SIA’s KrisF­lyer pro­gramme. They have to use their miles to pay for the ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>One Faber Group has other sim­i­lar din­ing op­tions for the gen­eral pub­lic, such as Fly Me To Italy, which show­cases cui­sine from var­i­ous Ital­ian re­gions and is priced at $328++ a cou­ple.</p>
    <p>My evening starts with a cock­tail, but the view from the top of Mount Faber is enough of a chill pill. The panorama takes in puff­ing in­dus­trial chim­neys as well as con­do­mini­ums and cars that look like toys. The sea, so invit­ing at sun­set, is soon mir­rored by an inky sky. The night is strewn with lights and cable cars glide past mine as silently as manta rays.</p>
    <p>Each din­ing ex­pe­ri­ence lasts 90 min­utes. Ser­vice is swift; it takes just 14 sec­onds to clear the plates and serve the next course when the cable car comes round at Mount Faber Sta­tion, be­fore mov­ing on to Sen­tosa.</p>
    <p>I have cho­sen the Aus­tralian menu by chef Mo­ran and start with SIA’s sig­na­ture satay, made of chicken and Im­pos­si­ble meat, a plant-based pro­tein.</p>
    <p>The Im­pos­si­ble op­tion tastes like a tooth­some lamb satay with Moroc­can spices. It is hard to be­lieve it is not meat though the satay sauce can be more peanutty.</p>
    <p>The bread bas­ket is an as­sort­ment that in­cludes SIA’s sig­na­ture gar­lic bread. While it is per­fectly pleas­ant, I don’t know why cham­pagne class na­tives might want pun­gent breath in an air cabin.</p>
    <p>Up next is an ap­pe­tiser of chilled osci­etra caviar served with creme fraiche, chives and bli­nis, which are tiny pan­cakes. I hadn’t eaten this food of the Rus­sian czars be­fore, but I am an in­stant fan. Steeped in flavour, the stur­geon roe is but­tery, with­out a trace of oili­ness.</p>
    <p>My main, pork belly with spiced ap­ple sauce, suf­fers from my plebian love of sio bak or Chi­nese roast pork. The skin is more chewy than crackly like I am used to, but the fatty lay­ers nes­tle unc­tu­ously against the ten­der lean meat. I can’t make out any spices in the ap­ple sauce, but it pro­vides the req­ui­site sweet­ness.</p>
    <p>I sym­pa­thise with what the baby fen­nel, an in­gre­di­ent in the dish, is try­ing to do. But rather than cut­ting through the fatty meat, the fen­nel, with its faint liquorice un­der­tones, sticks out like an antisocial loner. The parsnip, mildly sweet un­like its stri­dent, roasted Christ­mas ver­sion, fares bet­ter.</p>
    <p>The por­tions are gen­er­ous and I end the meal gal­lop­ing to the fin­ish line, with three dishes of ap­ple crum­ble, a cheese plate and a dizzy­ing ar­ray of fruit. The crum­ble, served with berries and pas­sion­fruit sauce, is a tad too tart but the cheeses are ex­cel­lent. I am par­tic­u­larly en­am­oured of an un­apolo­get­i­cally funky blue cheese.</p>
    <p>It has been a re­lax­ing evening and not only be­cause I have been swig­ging wine through­out.</p>
    <p>Din­ing in a cable car has been a calm­ing in­ter­lude, ow­ing some­thing, doubt­less, to the com­fort­ing food and the cool night breeze.</p>
