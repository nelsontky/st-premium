    <p>Re­tail­ers have had it tough for some time, with bricks-and-mor­tar op­er­a­tors un­der siege from on­line sellers, but they met with greater chal­lenges this year amid a pan­demic that has wreaked havoc across the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Most stores were forced to close tem­po­rar­ily dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod from April to June. Wary shop­pers pre­ferred to stay home, while safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures meant fewer buy­ers could roam the aisles.</p>
    <p>Re­tail sales hit a re­vised low of mi­nus 51.7 per cent in May com­pared with the same pe­riod last year. This mod­er­ated to a de­cline of 8.6 per cent in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>In­evitably, some re­tail­ers – in­clud­ing house­hold names – had to close for good, yet oth­ers found them­selves in a sweet spot and man­aged to thrive.</p>
    <p>RE­TAIL­ERS THAT FELL</p>
    <p>Robin­sons has weath­ered many storms over its 162 years here, but the pan­demic turned out to be the fi­nal nail in the cof­fin. The depart­ment store announced in Oc­to­ber that it would shut its last two stores, at The Heeren and Raf­fles City Shop­ping Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The flag­ship store at The Hereen closed its doors on Dec 16, but the Raf­fles City out­let has yet to an­nounce its last day and will stay open dur­ing the Christ­mas and New Year pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Re­struc­tur­ing spe­cial­ist Kor­daMen­tha was named as liq­uida­tor of the depart­ment store op­er­a­tor, which owed over 440 cred­i­tors at least $31.7 mil­lion as at last month.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Bri­tish re­tailer Marks & Spencer will close its out­let at Raf­fles City Shop­ping Cen­tre to­day, although its 10 other stores is­land­wide will re­main open.</p>
    <p>Both Marks & Spencer and sis­ter brand Robin­sons are part of the Dubai-based Al-Fut­taim Group, owned by Emi­rati ty­coon Ab­dulla Al Fut­taim and run by his son Omar, ac­cord­ing to Forbes.</p>
    <p>Other ca­su­al­ties of the pan­demic were Bri­tish fash­ion brand Topshop and its brother brand Top­man, which announced in Septem­ber that they would close their last store – in VivoCity – and go on­line after two decades of hav­ing a phys­i­cal pres­ence here.</p>
    <p>The first store opened at Wisma Atria in Or­chard Road in 2000.</p>
    <p>The brands are man­aged by Wing Tai Re­tail, which also has Adi­das, G2000, Dorothy Perkins and Uniqlo in its port­fo­lio here.</p>
    <p>In Bri­tain, Sir Philip Green’s Ar­ca­dia Group, which owns Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and other brands, has be­gun in­sol­vency pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>Food and bev­er­age firms have not had an easy time ei­ther, given re­duced ca­pac­ity due to safe dis­tanc­ing rules and shut­downs dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>The iconic Prima Tower Re­volv­ing Restau­rant in Kep­pel Road closed in Au­gust, after 43 years. It was ini­tially meant to close tem­po­rar­ily from April 6 to July 31, but de­cided to stop spin­ning for good be­cause of the hit from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese restau­rant, opened in 1977 by Prima Group, stood 60m above ground, on top of cylin­dri­cal wheat si­los, and spe­cialised in Bei­jing cui­sine. It was one of the last two re­volv­ing restau­rants here – the other is Tong Le Pri­vate Dining in Col­lyer Quay.</p>
    <p>RE­TAIL­ERS THAT BLOS­SOMED</p>
    <p>While some re­tail­ers closed their out­lets, Swedish fur­ni­ture gi­ant Ikea will open a new store in Jurong East next year, it said in May.</p>
    <p>The 6,500 sq m store in Jem mall will spread across three floors and in­clude a restau­rant. The store will re­place Robin­sons, which had been in the mall since 2013.</p>
    <p>Ikea opened in Sin­ga­pore in 1978 and has stores in Tampines and Alexan­dra that at­tract close to seven mil­lion vis­its a year.</p>
    <p>It said it will hire 200 peo­ple for the new store.</p>
    <p>The re­tailer recorded more on­line or­ders for fur­ni­ture and house­hold items as peo­ple shifted to work­ing from home dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>An­other busi­ness that grew this year was French sports re­tail spe­cial­ist De­cathlon, which opened its fifth ex­pe­ri­ence store here in Septem­ber. The store oc­cu­pies 3,200 sq m in The Cen­tre­point, mark­ing the brand’s first ven­ture into Sin­ga­pore’s main shop­ping belt, Or­chard Road.</p>
    <p>The two-storey out­let, which spans six units, re­placed depart­ment store Metro as The Cen­tre­point’s an­chor ten­ant.</p>
    <p>De­cathlon ar­rived here in 2013 as an on­line store and launched its first phys­i­cal out­let at Viva Busi­ness Park in Chai Chee three years later. Be­sides its five ex­pe­ri­ence shops, it has seven click-and-col­lect stores.</p>
    <p>Its on­line sales also boomed this year, most likely driven by increased de­mand for fit­ness equip­ment as peo­ple stepped up their ex­er­cise rou­tines amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But the big­gest growth was racked up by su­per­mar­kets, where tak­ings saw dou­ble-digit in­creases for most months rel­a­tive to last year.</p>
    <p>While shop­pers might have cut back on dis­cre­tionary items, there was panic buy­ing of gro­ceries ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Su­per­mar­ket op­er­a­tor Sheng Siong posted a net profit of $31.8 mil­lion for its third quar­ter ended Sept 30, up 54.4 per cent from a year ear­lier.</p>
