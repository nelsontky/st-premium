    <p>Ja­panese lead­ers have de­clined to budge on a do­mes­tic tourism cam­paign that is be­ing blamed as a ve­hi­cle for the third wave of in­fec­tions, even as the coun­try is on “max­i­mum alert” with the num­ber of Covid-19 cases hit­ting new highs for a sec­ond straight day yesterday.</p>
    <p>There were at least 2,377 cases yesterday, with one-day peaks rewrit­ten in six of the coun­try’s 10 most pop­u­lated pre­fec­tures in­clud­ing Tokyo, Osaka and Hokkaido.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to reporters, Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga, stress­ing the need for ut­most vig­i­lance, pro­posed “quiet gath­er­ings with masks” when din­ing out, with non­bind­ing mea­sures in­clud­ing a cap on party sizes of four peo­ple.</p>
    <p>But he ig­nored a shouted ques­tion about the Go To Travel cam­paign that pro­vides hefty sub­si­dies to do­mes­tic trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion pres­i­dent Toshio Nak­a­gawa had de­scribed it as a “sure cat­a­lyst” of the cur­rent wave.</p>
    <p>Chief Cab­i­net Sec­re­tary Kat­sunobu Kato said yesterday that the cam­paign will go on, as will the Go To Eat cam­paign to sup­port the ail­ing food and bev­er­age in­dus­try. He added that the onus is on trav­ellers to ex­er­cise social re­spon­si­bil­ity to cur­tail the spread of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>While there have been about 40 mil­lion overnight stays un­der the travel cam­paign, only 155 trav­ellers have been in­fected as of Tues­day, gov­ern­ment fig­ures show. An­other 144 em­ploy­ees of ho­tels in the cam­paign have also been in­fected.</p>
    <p>Yet med­i­cal ex­perts have ar­gued that these fig­ures do not tell the full pic­ture, with clus­ters now found in ru­ral re­gions that are un­equipped to deal with a surge in cases.</p>
    <p>Clus­ters have been found in ar­eas like Rishiri Is­land, lo­cated off the north­ern­most tip of Hokkaido, that has a pop­u­la­tion of just 1,964 peo­ple. In Miyagi pre­fec­ture in Ja­pan’s north-east, the local med­i­cal as­so­ci­a­tion yesterday de­clared a cri­sis over the short­age of beds af­ter the num­ber of cases rose by nearly 50 per cent since Nov 1.</p>
    <p>The Nikkei 225 index fell 0.4 per cent yesterday over virus fears, as a gov­ern­ment panel of med­i­cal ex­perts is set to meet to­day.</p>
    <p>Un­like the sec­ond wave where a vast ma­jor­ity of cases were traced to youth in nightlife district clus­ters, many of those in­fected in the cur­rent wave are mid­dle-aged and el­derly who are at risk of de­vel­op­ing se­vere con­di­tions, rais­ing concerns that the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion is more dan­ger­ous. But a state of emer­gency like that during the first wave in April and May is un­likely, with Ja­pan’s lead­ers mind­ful of the mone­tary and psy­cho­log­i­cal dam­age to a re­ces­sion­ary econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore the cur­rent wave, sui­cides have spiked, while bank­rupt­cies have sky­rock­eted es­pe­cially among mom-and-pop busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>In Tokyo, where yesterday’s 534 cases topped the pre­vi­ous high of 493 set just a day ago, Gov­er­nor Yuriko Koike raised the Covid-19 alert to the high­est on a four-tier scale. Dr No­rio Oma­gari, di­rec­tor of the Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion Cen­tre, warned that Tokyo is “in a phase of rapid spread”.</p>
    <p>Ms Koike did not cur­tail the op­er­at­ing hours of bars and restau­rants, un­like during the pre­vi­ous wave, saying that few cases were traced to late-night es­tab­lish­ments. But she urged those above 65 and with un­der­ly­ing health con­di­tions to avoid din­ing out.</p>
    <p>Other ar­eas with new peaks in­cluded Osaka, with 338 cases, and Hokkaido, with 267.</p>
    <p>Aichi, whose cap­i­tal is Nagoya, set a new daily high of 219 cases and raised its Covid-19 alert to the sec­ond-high­est on the four-tier scale. Also hit­ting new highs were Hyogo, where the city of Kobe is lo­cated, with 132 cases, and Chiba, east of Tokyo, with 106.</p>
