    <p>HONG KONG One of the 14 for­eign judges on Hong Kong’s top court has re­signed, re­port­edly over sweep­ing na­tional se­cu­rity leg­is­la­tion i mposed this sum­mer by China – the latest blow to the fi­nan­cial hub’s in­ter­na­tional rep­u­ta­tion that could raise fur­ther ques­tions about the sta­bil­ity of its ju­di­ciary.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Jus­tice James Spigel­man, the for­mer chief jus­tice of New South Wales, re­signed his po­si­tion as a non-per­ma­nent judge of the Court of Fi­nal Ap­peal on Sept 2, ac­cord­ing to a state­ment from the of­fice of Hong Kong Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam. “Mr Jus­tice Spigel­man did not give any rea­son for his res­ig­na­tion,” it said.</p>
    <p>His res­ig­na­tion was “re­lated to the con­tent of the na­tional se­cu­rity leg­is­la­tion”, the Aus­tralian Broad­cast­ing Corp re­ported, cit­ing a brief in­ter­view with Jus­tice Spigel­man, who did not elab­o­rate.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a reg­u­lar brief­ing in Bei­jing yes­ter­day that he was not aware of the re­port.</p>
    <p>The res­ig­na­tion high­lights grow­ing con­cerns about the in­de­pen­dence of Hong Kong’s trusted ju­di­ciary, which stands in con­trast to main­land courts that are presided over by judges who owe fealty to the rul­ing Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party.</p>
    <p>The fi­nan­cial hub has al­ready had its spe­cial trad­ing sta­tus un­der US law stripped away – and se­nior of­fi­cials, in­clud­ing Mrs Lam, sanc­tioned – by a Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion set on pun­ish­ing China over its crack­down on Hong Kong’s un­rest.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong Bar As­so­ci­a­tion has pre­vi­ously said it was “gravely con­cerned” about the con­tent and in­tro­duc­tion of the law, warn­ing that the leg­is­la­tion would “un­der­cut the in­de­pen­dent ex­er­cise of ju­di­cial power by the courts” in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>China by­passed Hong Kong’s Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil and im­posed the se­cu­rity law – which bans ter­ror­ism, se­ces­sion, sub­ver­sion of state power and col­lu­sion with for­eign forces – in late June af­ter un­prece­dented pro-democ­racy protests last year. For­eign gov­ern­ments led by the United States, as well as lawyers and le­gal aca­demics, have said the law is de­lib­er­ately vague, will erode key free­doms and crim­i­nalises pre­vi­ously law­ful dis­sent in the city.</p>
