    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Glee star Naya Rivera (left) died of ac­ci­den­tal drown­ing, the Ven­tura County med­i­cal ex­am­iner said on Tues­day, mark­ing the third tragic death of a cast mem­ber from the pop­u­lar tele­vi­sion mu­si­cal se­ries.</p>
    <p>Rivera, 33, was found in Lake Piru, near Los An­ge­les, on Mon­day, five days af­ter go­ing miss­ing on a boat­ing trip with her young son.</p>
    <p>The med­i­cal ex­am­iner’s re­port said there was no in­di­ca­tion that drugs or al­co­hol played a role in her death and there were no trau­matic in­juries or other med­i­cal con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Rivera played cheer­leader San­tana Lopez in Glee (2009 to 2015), the tele­vi­sion se­ries about a high-school choir. The mu­si­cal drama was one of the big­gest pop cul­ture hits 10 years ago, but has seen its share of tragedy.</p>
    <p>Cana­dian ac­tor Cory Mon­teith, who played foot­ball player Finn Hud­son, died at 31 of a drug over­dose in 2013.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can ac­tor Mark Salling, who played Finn’s best friend and foot­ball team­mate Puck, killed him­self in 2018 af­ter plead­ing guilty to pos­sess­ing child pornog­ra­phy. He was 35.</p>
    <p>Rivera’s body was re­cov­ered near the sur­face of the wa­ter and in an area where the boat was found that was 11m to 18m deep with heavy brush and trees un­der­wa­ter, of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>Rivera’s four-year-old son, Josey Hol­lis, who was dis­cov­ered alone and sleep­ing on the boat, told the author­i­ties he and his mother had gone swim­ming in the lake, a recre­ational reser­voir about 80km north of down­town Los An­ge­les.</p>
    <p>The sher­iff’s of­fi­cials in charge of the search said on Mon­day it was not clear what hap­pened, but Josey had told the in­ves­ti­ga­tors his mother pushed him back into the boat, but did not get back in her­self. Rivera was not wear­ing a life vest.</p>
    <p>The cre­ators of Glee, Ryan Mur­phy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Bren­nan, said on Tues­day they were set­ting up a col­lege fund for Rivera’s son.</p>
    <p>“She was fun. She was kind. She was gen­er­ous,” the three pro­duc­ers said in a state­ment. “Naya was more than just an ac­tor on our show – she was our friend.”</p>
    <p>Josey is Rivera’s son with ac­tor Ryan Dorsey. They mar­ried in 2014, but di­vorced in 2018.</p>
