    <p>The de­vel­op­ment of au­ton­o­mous ve­hi­cles (AVs) could make the ur­ban en­vi­ron­ment more live­able and help make trans­port more sus­tain­able.</p>
    <p>But the de­gree of ben­e­fit will de­pend on the char­ac­ter­is­tics of each city and its mo­bil­ity ecosys­tem, ac­cord­ing to a re­port ti­tled Can Self­Driv­ing Cars Stop The Ur­ban Mo­bil­ity Melt­down? by the Bos­ton Con­sult­ing Group (BCG) and Switzer­land’s Univer­sity of St Gallen, which was re­leased last week.</p>
    <p>Although the Covid-19 pan­demic is mak­ing com­muters favour pri­vate trans­port such as cars and bikes over shared mo­bil­ity for the next 12 to 18 months, many cities will em­brace shared AVs in the long run be­cause these can al­le­vi­ate prob­lems such as con­ges­tion, air pol­lu­tion and road fa­tal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>But while some cities will gain sig­nif­i­cant ad­van­tages by in­tro­duc­ing AVs, oth­ers will fare bet­ter by pro­mot­ing other mo­bil­ity op­tions, such as e-bikes and e-scoot­ers.</p>
    <p>In­deed, in some set­tings, AVs could ex­ac­er­bate the prob­lems that mu­nic­i­pal plan­ners are hop­ing to solve. Be­fore tak­ing ac­tion, cities must as­sess whether AVs will be a panacea or a bur­den.</p>
    <p>The re­port’s key find­ings are: • Cities achieve sig­nif­i­cant ben­e­fits by ac­tively shap­ing the ur­ban mo­bil­ity en­vi­ron­ment. For ex­am­ple, Los An­ge­les could cut its car­bon diox­ide emis­sions by</p>
    <p>2.7 mil­lion tonnes a year through poli­cies that pro­moted shared</p>
    <p>AVs and curbed the city’s pri­vate ve­hi­cle fleet.</p>
    <p>• New York plan­ners could free up the equiv­a­lent of about 900 blocks of space cur­rently re­served for park­ing, if they cre­ated the con­di­tions for robo-shut­tles to thrive.</p>
    <p>• New phys­i­cal and dig­i­tally con­nected in­fra­struc­ture (in­clud­ing ded­i­cated lanes and sen­sors that would en­able self-driv­ing cars to com­mu­ni­cate with the sur­round­ing en­vi­ron­ment) will be es­sen­tial for AVs to suc­ceed.</p>
    <p>• Cities that al­low pri­vate car use to grow in line with past trends will see their ur­ban en­vi­ron­ment de­te­ri­o­rate sig­nif­i­cantly, with traf­fic vol­ume in­creas­ing by an av­er­age of 6 per cent, and to­tal park­ing space by 8 per cent.</p>
    <p>• For some cities such as Hong</p>
    <p>Kong, pro­mot­ing mi­cro­mo­bil­ity and walk­ing could de­liver greater ben­e­fits than in­tro­duc­ing AVs. Af­ter an ini­tial wave of eu­pho­ria in the mid-2010s, self-driv­ing cars have be­come the ob­ject of con­sid­er­able scep­ti­cism. One rea­son for the change in pub­lic per­cep­tion is the re­al­i­sa­tion that AVs are un­likely to be avail­able at scale soon.</p>
    <p>To cut through the noise about AVs and gain an ob­jec­tive view of their ad­van­tages and likely ef­fects on dif­fer­ent cities, the study used a tool which could sim­u­late 1.7 bil­lion trips. With that, they mod­elled how AVs could im­prove or worsen the ur­ban en­vi­ron­ment and qual­ity of life in five ur­ban archetypes de­vel­oped based on data from more than 40 cities world­wide.</p>
    <p>Mr Niko­laus Lang, a BCG man­ag­ing direc­tor and se­nior part­ner, says: “Cities need to cre­ate a vi­sion of where they want to be in the fu­ture and start act­ing now. If they do noth­ing and if the growth in pri­vate car use in­creases in line with past trends, the ur­ban en­vi­ron­ment is set to worsen sig­nif­i­cantly.”</p>
    <p>While some com­pa­nies plan to launch AVs by the mid-2020s, ex­perts in­ter­viewed for the study reckon it will take cities un­til 2030 be­fore they are ready for them. Once they are, sales of self-driv­ing ve­hi­cles will rise rapidly.</p>
    <p>Readi­ness hinges on sev­eral fac­tors, in­clud­ing in­fra­struc­ture and reg­u­la­tion. To func­tion prop­erly, AVs will re­quire new hard and dig­i­tally con­nected in­fra­struc­ture, ac­cord­ing to 90 per cent of ex­perts in­ter­viewed. These in­clude ded­i­cated lanes, smart sig­nalling and charg­ing sta­tions.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tions are also a pre­req­ui­site for suc­cess­ful AV in­tro­duc­tion, 85 per cent of ex­perts say. Pol­i­cy­mak­ers must tackle is­sues such as ac­ci­dent li­a­bil­ity and laws gov­ern­ing road use. Data ac­cess and own­er­ship will be an­other im­por­tant area.</p>
    <p>About 87 per cent of ex­perts say cities will need to de­velop data an­a­lyt­ics ca­pa­bil­i­ties so they can con­trol and i mprove how AVs operate. Reg­u­la­tors will also need to con­sider eth­i­cal dilem­mas re­gard­ing how au­ton­o­mous sys­tems should re­spond to an emer­gency.</p>
    <p>Yet, the study con­cludes that tra­di­tional pub­lic trans­porta­tion will likely con­tinue to be the back­bone of ur­ban mo­bil­ity in most cities.</p>
    <p>The study rec­om­mends that pub­lic trans­port plan­ners col­lab­o­rate with au­ton­o­mous mo­bil­ity fleet op­er­a­tors and mi­cro­mo­bil­ity firms “so that they can de­liver a seam­less, multi-modal travel ex­pe­ri­ence”.</p>
    <p>“They should in­clude these new providers when plan­ning long-term in­fra­struc­ture in­vest­ments and should work with them to im­prove net­work ac­cess,” the study added.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the fo­cus of AV tri­als has been on pub­lic trans­port.</p>
    <p>Mr Lam Wee Shann, the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity’s chief in­no­va­tion and tech­nol­ogy of­fi­cer, says: “For densely pop­u­lated cities like Sin­ga­pore, ve­hi­cles with a larger ca­pac­ity, such as au­ton­o­mous shut­tle buses, are the best way to carry lots of peo­ple dur­ing peak hours.”</p>
