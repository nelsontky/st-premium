    <p>A group of more than 10 Bukit Timah res­i­dents spent their Sun­day morn­ing help­ing to trim some 1.5ha of over­grown grass in Toh Yi. Many were mi­grant work­ers who had moved into the area re­cently and had hoped to show their ap­pre­ci­a­tion for the warm wel­come their new neigh­bours had given them. HOME</p>
    <p>A group of more than 10 Bukit Timah res­i­dents rolled up their sleeves and spent their Sun­day morn­ing help­ing to trim some 1.5 ha of over­grown grass around the Hous­ing Board blocks in Toh Yi.</p>
    <p>Many were new­com­ers who had moved in just two months ago and had hoped to show their ap­pre­ci­a­tion for the warm wel­come their new neigh­bours had given them.</p>
    <p>In fact, these new­com­ers are mi­grant work­ers who are housed at the for­mer Ngee Ann Poly­tech­nic staff apart­ments at 90, 92 and 94 Kis­mis Av­enue, a five-minute walk from Toh Yi Drive.</p>
    <p>One of them was Mr Natesan Muniaiah, 32, a worker from In­dia who has been in Sin­ga­pore for eight years. His em­ployer, Woh Hup, had agreed to the ini­tia­tive, as had King Wan Con­struc­tion, which em­ploys some of the other work­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Natesan is cur­rently liv­ing in Block 92. He told the Straits Times he was glad to have a chance to give back to the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“It is a Sun­day, but we are very happy to vol­un­teer to do this as we are liv­ing in the area.”</p>
    <p>Some 1,030 mi­grant work­ers in es­sen­tial ser­vices moved into the apart­ments in early May. They were greeted with care packs from lo­cal res­i­dents who have since con­tin­ued to gift them food and other sup­plies.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State Sim Ann, who is an MP for Hol­land-Bukit Timah GRC, joined yes­ter­day’s ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>“I was very touched by how pos­i­tively the work­ers re­sponded to the com­mu­nity’s ef­forts to wel­come them and that they are will­ing to come out and help us even on their rest day,” she said.</p>
    <p>Her sen­ti­ments were shared by res­i­dent Nancy Tan, 73. Upon see­ing Ms Sim and the work­ers toil­ing un­der the sun near her home in Block 8 Toh Yi Drive, Ms Tan came out with of­fer­ings of wa­ter and chilled drinks.</p>
    <p>As a sur­vivor of dengue fever, the po­ten­tially deadly disease car­ried by mos­qui­toes, Ms Tan said she was wor­ried that over­grown grass could gather wa­ter and be­come a breed­ing ground for mos­qui­toes.</p>
    <p>“The grassy ar­eas around here are where chil­dren some­times play. So I was very happy to see them cut­ting the grass this morn­ing,” added the three-year Toh Yi res­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Ms Sim shared that the ini­tia­tive was pri­ori­tised es­pe­cially as the Toh Yi area was a clus­ter of 22 dengue cases, one of seven clus­ters in her Bukit Timah ward which to­gether have over 40 cases.</p>
    <p>She also said it has been hard to main­tain the es­tate’s land­scap­ing dur­ing the pan­demic, as work­ers in many hor­ti­cul­tural firms had not been cleared by the au­thor­i­ties to re­sume work.</p>
    <p>But Mr Ed­ward Chia, a fresh face and her re­cently elected par­lia­men­tary team­mate, man­aged to use his busi­ness net­work to se­cure help, she said.</p>
    <p>Mr Chia, who was at a sim­i­lar grass-cut­ting ini­tia­tive yes­ter­day morn­ing in his Zhenghua ward, said he was thank­ful for the vol­un­teers who stepped for­ward to sup­port the com­mu­nity ef­fort.</p>
    <p>He also thanked “fel­low SME owner and friend” Michael Teh, who runs Na­ture Land­scapes, the firm that he con­tacted to help with the grass-cut­ting.</p>
    <p>“This can-do spirit and own­er­ship re­ally ex­em­pli­fies the best of our com­mu­nity,” said Mr Chia.</p>
    <p>It is a Sun­day, but we are very happy to vol­un­teer to do this as we are liv­ing in the area."</p>
