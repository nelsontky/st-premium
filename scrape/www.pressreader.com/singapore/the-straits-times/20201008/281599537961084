    <p>Uni­ver­si­ties are push­ing for in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary cur­ric­ula to bet­ter equip their stu­dents for a fu­ture of in­creas­ingly com­plex chal­lenges. A key skill is the abil­ity to spot con­nec­tions in ap­par­ently un­re­lated fields, says education correspond­ent Amelia Teng (be­low).</p>
    <p>In the past, most arts stu­dents would baulk at data pre­sented to them, while sci­ence stu­dents would shy away from writ­ing his­tory es­says.</p>
    <p>But to­day, the arts and sciences may not be the po­lar op­po­sites they seem to be – in fact, there are points where they cross each other’s paths.</p>
    <p>This is hap­pen­ing amid a grow­ing aware­ness world­wide that to truly ap­pre­ci­ate the chal­lenges posed by the likes of cli­mate change, pub­lic health and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, an un­der­stand­ing of dif­fer­ent dis­ci­plines is needed to find so­lu­tions to what are, by their very na­ture, mul­ti­fac­eted prob­lems.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, across the world, uni­ver­si­ties, which tra­di­tion­ally sep­a­rate the study of hu­man­i­ties and sciences, are ex­per­i­ment­ing with more flex­i­ble ways of learning, to pre­pare their grad­u­ates for this new world.</p>
    <p>BRIDG­ING DI­VIDES</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) plans to bring to­gether its Fac­ulty of Arts and So­cial Sciences and Fac­ulty of Sci­ence to form a Col­lege of Hu­man­i­ties and Sciences.</p>
    <p>If its plans are ap­proved by the au­thor­i­ties, the col­lege could be­gin ac­cept­ing stu­dents next Au­gust, for the next aca­demic year.</p>
    <p>As part of a foun­da­tional com­mon cur­ricu­lum, stu­dents will take mod­ules in dif­fer­ent dis­ci­plines across the hu­man­i­ties, so­cial sciences, sci­ence and math­e­mat­ics.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents in this col­lege will also have greater flex­i­bil­ity and more choices of­fered by the wide range of sub­jects across both fac­ul­ties.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ho Teck Hua, NUS’ senior deputy pres­i­dent and provost, said these plans build on the univer­sity’s ex­pe­ri­ence in in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary learning in the past 20 years.</p>
    <p>In the ear­lier years, it had a Tal­ent De­vel­op­ment Pro­gramme that ex­posed small co­horts of stu­dents to “knowl­edge, skills and habits of thought” be­yond their aca­demic spe­cial­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>This has since evolved into a range of of­fer­ings such as the Univer­sity Schol­ars Pro­gramme (USP) and the Univer­sity Town</p>
    <p>Col­lege Pro­gramme, which em­pha­sise mul­ti­dis­ci­plinary learning, with stu­dents from dif­fer­ent dis­ci­plines.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, other uni­ver­si­ties in Sin­ga­pore have en­cour­aged un­der­grad­u­ates to broaden their per­spec­tives and draw con­nec­tions be­tween fields.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity (SMU) provost Ti­mothy Clark said its core cur­ricu­lum is not a “ran­dom as­sort­ment of use­ful mod­ules, but stands on three in­ter-re­lated pil­lars of de­vel­op­ment – ca­pa­bil­i­ties, com­mu­ni­ties and civil­i­sa­tions”.</p>
    <p>“Each (is) fur­ther or­gan­ised into bas­kets of fo­cal ar­eas, to help stu­dents un­der­stand why these skills and knowl­edge are im­por­tant to them and how they are in­ter-re­lated,” he added.</p>
    <p>This set of mod­ules forms 33 per cent of SMU’s un­der­grad­u­ate cur­ricu­lum.</p>
    <p>Post­grad­u­ate stu­dents from dif­fer­ent schools and pro­grammes will also, from the next aca­demic year, be able to take com­mon cour­ses across SMU, in ar­eas such as sus­tain­able im­pact and de­sign think­ing.</p>
    <p>Yale-NUS Col­lege, whose par­ent in­sti­tu­tion is NUS, also has a com­mon cur­ricu­lum that al­lows stu­dents to ex­plore the hu­man­i­ties, so­cial sciences and nat­u­ral sciences in the form of mod­ules such as sci­en­tific in­quiry and mod­ern so­cial thought.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Joanne Roberts, Yale-NUS’ ex­ec­u­tive vice-pres­i­dent of aca­demic af­fairs, said stu­dents learn to un­cover links be­tween dif­fer­ent fields and con­nect these dis­cov­er­ies to top­ics and prob­lems in so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>In the third year, stu­dents se­lect a ma­jor. Among Yale-NUS’ most re­cent batch of grad­u­ates, about 70 per cent of sci­ence ma­jors with a mi­nor chose a hu­man­i­ties or so­cial sciences mi­nor, and 20 per cent of non-sci­ence ma­jors with a mi­nor took a sci­ence mi­nor.</p>
    <p>JOIN­ING THE DOTS</p>
    <p>An in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary education does not mean that un­der­grad­u­ates are ex­pected to be all-know­ing and equally pro­fi­cient in mul­ti­ple ar­eas of knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>It is not about pump­ing more knowl­edge and con­tent into grad­u­ates so they can take on more jobs. Rather, it is about ex­pos­ing them to var­i­ous in­tel­lec­tual ap­proaches early in their un­der­grad­u­ate years and help­ing them join the dots be­tween the soft and hard sciences.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents will still even­tu­ally pur­sue their in­ter­est in one or two ar­eas, but even the spe­cial­ist must know that prob­lems are sel­dom one-di­men­sional.</p>
    <p>Through their years of study, stu­dents must be able to at least un­der­stand how is­sues of­ten over­lap in the real world.</p>
    <p>To that end, Prof Ho said the pro­posed NUS col­lege’s core cur­ricu­lum will in­clude “spe­cially de­signed in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary mod­ules in­te­grat­ing knowl­edge and meth­ods from dif­fer­ent dis­ci­plines”.</p>
    <p>He said this is dif­fer­ent from mul­ti­dis­ci­plinary learning, which in­volves the study of var­i­ous fields.</p>
    <p>“In short, the in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary whole is greater than the sum of its parts,” he said.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents said hav­ing the breadth and flex­i­bil­ity to ex­plore top­ics out­side their spe­cial­i­sa­tions en­able them to draw con­nec­tions be­tween seem­ingly con­trast­ing sub­jects.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, NUS third-year English lit­er­a­ture ma­jor Jen Chik, 21, has taken mod­ules from var­i­ous dis­ci­plines – hu­man­i­ties and so­cial sciences, and sciences and tech­nolo­gies – as part of the USP.</p>
    <p>One such mod­ule was on data analysis, which ex­posed her to dif­fer­ent tech­niques of study­ing data.</p>
    <p>Ea­ger to try out her newly learnt skill, she em­barked on a project to mea­sure the gen­eral sen­ti­ment in the text of Char­lotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre, us­ing soft­ware.</p>
    <p>“It was a dif­fer­ent way of vi­su­al­is­ing a lit­er­ary text, with bar charts and graphs, and I could cor­re­late the re­sults with my in­ter­pre­ta­tion of the text,” said Ms Chik.</p>
    <p>“It felt for­eign and in­ac­ces­si­ble to me at first, but in the USP, we have a cul­ture of try­ing new things and ask­ing our peers and pro­fes­sors for help,” she added.</p>
    <p>Yale-NUS third-year stu­dent Amirul Hakim, 23, is ma­jor­ing in phi­los­o­phy, but has de­cided to pur­sue a ca­reer in medicine.</p>
    <p>Af­ter four years at the lib­eral arts col­lege, he will spend an­other four years at Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School as part of a path­way of­fered by both in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>“If you look at medicine, it’s not just a pro­fes­sional prac­tice of sci­ence, but mak­ing good and eth­i­cal de­ci­sions,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mod­ules in mod­ern so­cial thought and an­thro­pol­ogy helped him gain a deeper un­der­stand­ing of ethics and the hu­man con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Med­i­cal an­thro­pol­ogy, he added, stud­ies how peo­ple per­ceive health­care sys­tems, dis­eases and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal drugs.</p>
    <p>AN UNDIS­CI­PLINED WORLD</p>
    <p>NUS senior eco­nomics lec­turer Kelvin Seah said grad­u­ates who are well versed in con­trast­ing or com­ple­men­tary sub­jects have the po­ten­tial to fill a wide va­ri­ety of jobs.</p>
    <p>“For in­stance, a grad­u­ate who is trained in both data sci­ence and com­mu­ni­ca­tions and new me­dia... would be well placed for jobs in­volv­ing data analysis, me­dia and jour­nal­ism, as well as jobs that cut across these two dis­ci­plines, like those in business con­sul­tancy,” he said, giv­ing his com­ments as an in­de­pen­dent aca­demic.</p>
    <p>Be­sides hav­ing more job op­tions, grad­u­ates who can see con­nec­tions can bet­ter un­der­stand the world’s in­creas­ingly un­ruly prob­lems and ap­pre­ci­ate the trade-offs and com­plex­i­ties in de­sign­ing so­lu­tions for them. Take, for ex­am­ple, ef­forts to tackle the mul­ti­ple prob­lems posed by cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>“An en­gi­neer can build a bet­ter air-con­di­tion­ing sys­tem, low­er­ing our car­bon foot­print. A be­havioural scientist can tackle con­sump­tion pat­terns. A scientist can de­velop mod­els to pre­dict the ef­fec­tive­ness of in­ter­ven­tions,” said Prof Ho.</p>
    <p>But in iso­la­tion, the spe­cific ex­per­tise of these in­di­vid­u­als would not be able to fix the prob­lem.</p>
    <p>And that is why mar­ry­ing the soft and hard sciences is key to en­sur­ing that grad­u­ates have a broader, more bal­anced per­spec­tive on is­sues of the day and are sen­si­tive to the nu­ances of real-world prob­lems.</p>
    <p>Na­tional In­sti­tute of Education (NIE) don Jason Tan brought up so­cial me­dia as an­other mul­ti­di­men­sional is­sue.</p>
    <p>“From an IT (in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy) point of view, you can im­pose tighter con­trols on what peo­ple can put up on­line, but you must also con­sider the psy­cho­log­i­cal and so­cial part of so­cial me­dia – why peo­ple post on­line, and how does it af­fect re­la­tion­ships,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 cri­sis has fur­ther high­lighted the need to look at a prob­lem from dif­fer­ent an­gles, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Tan.</p>
    <p>“It’s not a purely med­i­cal so­lu­tion of look­ing for a vac­cine and sim­ply so­cial dis­tanc­ing. Even med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als re­alise it’s nec­es­sary to look at other as­pects – pub­lic trust of gov­ern­ment, spread of false in­for­ma­tion, and re­solv­ing eco­nomic dam­age.”</p>
    <p>Education con­sul­tant Ho Boon Tiong, an ad­junct pro­fes­sor at NIE, said: “The world is mov­ing at a much faster pace and in a more un­pre­dictable way. We don’t even know the names of jobs in the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>The fu­ture econ­omy will need work­ers who have in­ter­nalised skills like crit­i­cal think­ing, cre­ativ­ity and be­ing able to draw links be­tween fields, Dr Ho added.</p>
    <p>“It is not just about con­tent, but hav­ing val­ues like open-mind­ed­ness, re­silience and a healthy sense of scep­ti­cism,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Daniel Soh, man­ag­ing part­ner of ex­ec­u­tive head­hunt­ing firm Lead­er­ship Ad­vi­sory, said em­ploy­ers are look­ing for soft skills in can­di­dates, not just do­main knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>“A po­ten­tial em­ployee’s abil­ity in dig­i­tal savvi­ness, prob­lem-solv­ing skills, cre­ativ­ity, strong so­cial skills, be­ing able to col­lab­o­rate, adapt and be re­silient are equally para­mount.”</p>
    <p>These are the traits that make em­ploy­ees ver­sa­tile across industries, he said.</p>
    <p>Such at­tributes, along with the abil­ity to keep learning and find con­nec­tions in an un­tidy world, are the true mark of an in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary education.</p>
