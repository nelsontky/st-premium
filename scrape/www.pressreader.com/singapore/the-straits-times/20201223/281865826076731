    <p>In one fell swoop, In­done­sian Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo yes­ter­day axed six min­is­ters in a ma­jor Cab­i­net reshuf­fle that an­a­lysts said was aimed at re­gain­ing pub­lic trust and steer­ing the coun­try out of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The min­is­te­rial shake-up was long over­due and much an­tic­i­pated as the coun­try strug­gled with a pub­lic health cri­sis that has not only claimed some 20,000 lives at home but also bat­tered the econ­omy, South-east Asia’s largest, and dis­rupted liveli­hoods.</p>
    <p>Mr Noory Ok­thariza, a po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist at the Jakarta-based think-tank, Cen­tre for Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies, said the pub­lic was dis­sat­is­fied with the gov­ern­ment over a num­ber of is­sues.</p>
    <p>These in­cluded the han­dling of the pan­demic as well as the pas­sage of con­tro­ver­sial anti-cor­rup­tion and labour laws, which sparked na­tion­wide protests. A reshuf­fle was one way to “rekin­dle the op­ti­mism”, Mr Noory said.</p>
    <p>“The Cab­i­net reshuf­fle is long over­due. It’s also nec­es­sary and must be done as soon as pos­si­ble as gov­ern­ment ef­fec­tive­ness is key in im­ple­ment­ing planned pro­grammes,” he had ear­lier told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“Mr Joko has only three years to go be­fore he ends his term, which is a very short time to help him ac­com­plish his mis­sion,” he said.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say the pan­demic has been a ma­jor test of lead­er­ship and ca­pa­bil­ity for Mr Joko’s “On­ward Indonesia Cab­i­net” in­stalled in Oc­to­ber last year, a 34-strong team of tech­nocrats and politi­cians as well as veter­ans and new­com­ers.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a di­vi­sive elec­tion, Mr Joko chose peo­ple from var­i­ous back­grounds to ce­ment his po­si­tion and re­store na­tional unity. But Covid-19 struck and, as cases soared, voices grew louder for cred­i­ble and com­pe­tent lead­ers to step for­ward to deal with the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>At the top of the re­place­ment list was out­go­ing Health Min­is­ter Ter­awan Agus Pu­tranto, who has been crit­i­cised se­verely for un­der­play­ing the pan­demic and for his pub­lic gaffes, which in­cluded ask­ing peo­ple to pray to ward off the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>In June, a fu­ri­ous Mr Joko, who is more pop­u­larly known as Jokowi, pub­licly lam­basted his</p>
    <p>Cab­i­net for “a lack of sense of cri­sis” and warned that heads might roll. Dr Ter­awan’s min­istry re­ceived an ear­ful for slow dis­tri­bu­tion of so­cial aid, and the for­mer mil­i­tary doc­tor has flown un­der the radar since.</p>
    <p>The health port­fo­lio has now gone to Mr Budi Gu­nadi Sadikin, known for his good man­age­rial and or­gan­i­sa­tional skills, given that he is a for­mer banker, a deputy min­is­ter of state en­ter­prises, and the head of the na­tional eco­nomic re­cov­ery com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>But an­a­lysts say some in the med­i­cal sec­tor might be un­happy with the ap­point­ment as the health min­is­ter’s post has tra­di­tion­ally been re­served for doc­tors or aca­demi­cians with med­i­cal de­grees.</p>
    <p>“It might be a lit­tle risky to ap­point a fig­ure with no med­i­cal back­ground... the doc­tors and nurses know how badly the pan­demic is be­ing man­aged in Indonesia and would surely ex­pect a med­i­cally qual­i­fied per­son to un­der­stand the dan­gers of the virus,” said Mr Noory.</p>
    <p>The choice of new re­li­gious min­is­ter Yaqut Cho­lil Qoumas, who is from Nahd­latul Ulama, the big­gest Mus­lim or­gan­i­sa­tion in the coun­try, is no sur­prise as se­nior cler­ics from the group have tra­di­tion­ally held the post.</p>
    <p>Dr Djayadi Hanan, a po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst from Para­mad­ina Univer­sity, noted that apart from Mr Yaqut, the new faces in the Cab­i­net had a back­ground in eco­nomics, sug­gest­ing that the Pres­i­dent was fo­cused on eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>New so­cial af­fairs min­is­ter Tri Ris­ma­harini, from Mr Joko’s In­done­sian Demo­cratic Party of Strug­gle, has been known to be a “dis­rup­tor”. She was mayor of Surabaya in East Java and has a rep­u­ta­tion for get­ting things done quickly as well as hav­ing a good grasp of the grass­roots.</p>
    <p>In­com­ing mar­itime af­fairs and fish­eries min­is­ter Sakti Wahyu Treng­gono is a renowned telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions en­tre­pre­neur.</p>
    <p>Mr Muham­mad Lutfi, a for­mer com­mis­sioner of lo­cal en­ergy giant Medco En­ergi In­ter­na­sional, will helm the Trade Min­istry, while busi­ness­man turned politi­cian San­di­aga Uno will be in charge of the tourism and cre­ative econ­omy min­istry.</p>
    <p>Mr San­di­aga’s ap­point­ment came as a sur­prise to some. The 51-year-old was run­ning mate to for­mer army gen­eral Prabowo Su­bianto, who chal­lenged Mr Joko in last year’s pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Prabowo joined Mr Joko’s Cab­i­net last year as De­fence Min­is­ter, and has proved to be a de­pend­able part­ner and hard-work­ing min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr San­di­aga ap­pears to have fol­lowed in the foot­steps of the Gerindra Party chair­man.</p>
    <p>Dr Djayadi said that Mr Prabowo may have nudged Mr San­di­aga to ac­cept Mr Joko’s of­fer, as Gerindra is part of the rul­ing coali­tion.</p>
    <p>But the an­a­lyst also be­lieves that Mr San­di­aga har­bours am­bi­tions to con­test the 2024 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“If he be­comes min­is­ter, he will have a big­ger po­lit­i­cal stage. For the next two to three years, do­mes­tic tourism will be a big thing due to the pan­demic keep­ing tourists at home. As tourism min­is­ter, he will have a prom­i­nent role in this,” Dr Djayadi said.</p>
