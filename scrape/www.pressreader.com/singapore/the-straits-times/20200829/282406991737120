    <p>Jordan Hen­der­son has urged Liver­pool to show their hunger to re­tain the Premier League ti­tle when they face FA Cup cham­pi­ons Arse­nal in the Com­mu­nity Shield today.</p>
    <p>Just five weeks af­ter the Reds cap­tain lifted the English top-flight tro­phy – the club’s first in 30 years – Jur­gen Klopp’s side kick off the new sea­son in the glam­our friendly at Wem­b­ley.</p>
    <p>While their ti­tle de­fence does not get un­der way un­til Sept 12, the Reds are keen to lay down an early marker to their ri­vals.</p>
    <p>Only Manch­ester City (2017-19) have won back-to-back ti­tles since Manch­ester United did so in 2008, un­der­lin­ing the dif­fi­culty in re­tain­ing the league.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Eng­land mid­fielder Hen­der­son is pleased with the at­ti­tude he has seen from his team­mates at a train­ing camp in Aus­tria.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been crack­ing on, re­ally work­ing hard. New sea­son, new start and a lot more things we want to go on and achieve,” he told Liver­pool’s web­site. “I’m re­ally ex­cited to see what we can do this sea­son, an­other big sea­son for us.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully, we can take con­fi­dence from the last year or two, but we need to stay hun­gry and keep the de­sire to go and want more.</p>
    <p>“I can cer­tainly see that from the first days that I’ve watched train­ing in pre-sea­son.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Klopp has said he would be i nter­ested i n adding Barcelona cap­tain Lionel Messi to his squad but a deal is out of the ques­tion due to the astro­nom­i­cal amount of money in­volved.</p>
    <p>Messi stunned world foot­ball this week when he wanted to leave Barcelona af­ter nearly two decades with the Cata­lan club.</p>
    <p>When asked if he would be happy to bring the Ar­gen­tinian for­ward to An­field, Klopp said at a press con­fer­ence ahead of the Com­mu­nity Shield: “In­ter­est? Yeah, who doesn’t want Messi in their team. But no chance. The numbers are ab­so­lutely not for us.</p>
    <p>“For the Premier League, it would be great. I would like to see it but I’m not sure if I will.”</p>
    <p>Pep Guardi­ola’s Manch­ester City are one of the favourites to sign the six-time World Player of the Year.</p>
    <p>Klopp has yet to make any ma­jor new sign­ings – only back-up de­fender Kostas Tsimikas has ar­rived from Olympiakos for £11.75 mil­lion (S$21.21 mil­lion) – and they will face a re­newed chal­lenge from City, Chelsea and United.</p>
    <p>For Arse­nal, the sea­son cur­tain­raiser of­fers man­ager Mikel Arteta, who could start new boy Wil­lian – signed on a free trans­fer from Chelsea – an op­por­tu­nity to gauge his side’s progress head­ing into his first full cam­paign in charge.</p>
    <p>Cap­tain Pierre-Em­er­ick Aubameyang has kept the Gun­ners wait­ing as they try to per­suade him to ex­tend a con­tract that ex­pires at the end of the new sea­son.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Arteta is con­fi­dent that their top scorer for the past two sea­sons will com­mit his longterm fu­ture to the club.</p>
    <p>He will also of­fer an olive branch to Me­sut Ozil and Mat­teo Guen­douzi.</p>
