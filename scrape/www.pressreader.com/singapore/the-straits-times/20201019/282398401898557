    <p>LON­DON • Liver­pool were left fear­ing the worst on Satur­day amid spec­u­la­tion that Vir­gil van Dijk could miss the rest of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>The club-record sign­ing un­der­went scans on his right knee and is sus­pected to have suf­fered a cru­ci­ate lig­a­ment in­jury fol­low­ing a hor­ror chal­lenge by Ever­ton goal­keeper Jor­dan Pick­ford dur­ing Satur­day’s 2-2 Mersey­side derby draw at Good­i­son Park.</p>
    <p>The 29-year-old left hos­pi­tal on crutches, with beIN Sports pun­dit and for­mer Dutch mid­fielder Nigel de Jong claim­ing the cen­tre-back could be out “for 7-8 months”.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool have yet to state the sever­ity of the in­jury, al­though man­ager Jur­gen Klopp con­firmed the early prog­no­sis was “not good”.</p>
    <p>He said: “It’s not good. Vir­gil plays with pain but he couldn’t play on. Not good.”</p>
    <p>The set­back is a huge blow to the cham­pi­ons, who have con­ceded 13 goals in their five league games this sea­son. They con­ceded as many af­ter 15 games last cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Thir­teen goals is also the most the Reds have let in af­ter five league games since 1953-54.</p>
    <p>Van Dijk mar­shalled the league’s tight­est de­fence for the past two sea­sons and has not missed an English top-flight game since Jan­uary 2018, when he j oined Liver­pool from Southamp­ton for £75 mil­lion (S$131.6 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>The Dutch­man had played ev­ery minute of his side’s last 74 Pre­mier League matches dat­ing back to Septem­ber 2018. And with No. 1 goal­keeper Alis­son Becker out with a shoul­der prob­lem, Klopp will have to make ad­just­ments af­ter los­ing an­other de­fen­sive rock.</p>
    <p>Klopp also has con­cerns over the fit­ness of mid­fielder Thi­ago Al­can­tara, who has re­ceived an apol­ogy from Ever­ton for­ward Richarli­son for his poor chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Thi­ago fin­ished the match, while Richarli­son was shown a straight red card but Klopp re­vealed that the 29-year-old could be doubt­ful for their trip to Am­s­ter­dam to face Ajax in the Cham­pi­ons League on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“When I left the pitch, Thi­ago told me in the red card sit­u­a­tion with Richarli­son he thinks he got in­jured,” the Ger­man said. “We will see if it’s true or not, but if he felt like this then we need to have a look.”</p>
    <p>Richarli­son blamed his heavy lunge on “sheer over-ded­i­ca­tion”.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one who knows my back­ground knows that I was never a vi­o­lent player,” the Brazil in­ter­na­tional said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“I did not en­ter that dis­pute with the in­ten­tion of hurt­ing Thi­ago... I al­ready sent a mes­sage to him apol­o­gis­ing and I also do it here pub­licly. I hope he hasn’t been hurt and that ev­ery­thing is fine.”</p>
