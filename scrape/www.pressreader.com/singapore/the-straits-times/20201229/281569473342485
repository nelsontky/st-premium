    <p>Pi­o­neer and Merdeka gen­er­a­tion cit­i­zens can con­tinue to en­joy dis­counts on their pur­chases at FairPrice out­lets for an­other year. The move will cost the chain more than $10 mil­lion, in ad­di­tion to the $43 mil­lion in dis­counts al­ready given to mem­bers since the schemes were launched.</p>
    <p>Se­nior cit­i­zens from the Pi­o­neer and Merdeka gen­er­a­tions can con­tinue to en­joy dis­counts on their pur­chases at FairPrice out­lets for an­other year.</p>
    <p>From Jan 1, those from the Pi­o­neer Gen­er­a­tion will have their 3 per cent dis­count ben­e­fit ex­tended by a year, the su­per­mar­ket chain an­nounced yes­ter­day. They will get to en­joy the dis­count twice ev­ery week, on Mon­day and Wed­nes­day, at all FairPrice su­per­mar­kets and hy­per­mar­kets is­land­wide.</p>
    <p>Merdeka Gen­er­a­tion se­niors will also get 3 per cent off their gro­ceries ev­ery Wed­nes­day for an­other year from Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The move will cost the chain more than $10 mil­lion, in ad­di­tion to the $43 mil­lion in dis­counts al­ready given to mem­bers since the schemes were launched.</p>
    <p>The Pi­o­neer Gen­er­a­tion Dis­count Scheme was in­tro­duced in 2014 and has been ex­tended six times. The Merdeka Gen­er­a­tion Dis­count Scheme was launched in 2019.</p>
    <p>NTUC FairPrice group chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Seah Kian Peng said the su­per­mar­ket chain is en­cour­aged that the dis­count schemes con­tinue to re­ceive a strong pos­i­tive re­cep­tion from el­derly cus­tomers. “Last year, FairPrice’s dis­count schemes helped mem­bers and se­niors save over $7.7 mil­lion... we hope that these ef­forts will con­tinue to help cus­tomers stretch their dol­lar in the year ahead,” he said.</p>
    <p>FairPrice will also con­tinue to of­fer a 2 per cent dis­count on Tues­days for all shop­pers above the age of 60.</p>
    <p>The Pi­o­neer Gen­er­a­tion Dis­count Scheme has dis­bursed more than $24 mil­lion in dis­counts to mem­bers over the years.</p>
    <p>This year, the Pi­o­neer Gen­er­a­tion saved $4.5 mil­lion, and the Merdeka Gen­er­a­tion $3.3 mil­lion, through the dis­count schemes.</p>
    <p>Shop­pers should present their Merdeka Gen­er­a­tion or Pi­o­neer Gen­er­a­tion card at the cashier counter when check­ing out of FairPrice stores.</p>
    <p>Those who opt for self-check­out should se­lect the Merdeka Gen­er­a­tion or Pi­o­neer Gen­er­a­tion dis­count op­tion on the ma­chines. The dis­counts ap­ply for up to $200 per trans­ac­tion each day.</p>
