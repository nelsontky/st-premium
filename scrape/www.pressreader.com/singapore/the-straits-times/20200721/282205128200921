    <p>The Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Author­ity (Acra) is seek­ing pub­lic feed­back on pro­posed amend­ments to the Com­pa­nies Act.</p>
    <p>The Com­pa­nies Act Work­ing Group (CAWG), set up by Acra in 2018 to re­view sev­eral ar­eas of the Act, has re­viewed 56 is­sues and rec­om­mended 36 leg­isla­tive re­forms.</p>
    <p>Th­ese cover fa­cil­i­tat­ing dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, types of com­pa­nies and fi­nan­cial re­port­ing, mat­ters re­lat­ing to di­rec­tors and com­pany sec­re­taries, safe­guard­ing share­hold­ers’ in­ter­ests, share cap­i­tal and fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance, as well as up­dat­ing out­dated pro­vi­sions.</p>
    <p>Among other things, CAWG con­sid­ered the use of dig­i­tal me­dia and tech­nol­ogy, and made rec­om­men­da­tions in re­spect of the de­ma­te­ri­al­i­sa­tion of phys­i­cal share cer­tifi­cates and fa­cil­i­tat­ing dig­i­tal meet­ings. It also sug­gested that the con­cept of a “mi­cro” com­pany be in­tro­duced. This may be de­fined as a firm with to­tal an­nual rev­enue and to­tal as­sets each be­ing not more than $500,000.</p>
    <p>Such com­pa­nies that are non­pub­licly ac­count­able could then pre­pare re­duced or sim­pli­fied fi­nan­cial state­ments, ac­cord­ing to CAWG’s rec­om­men­da­tion.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Acra has also re­viewed ex­ist­ing reg­u­la­tory pro­cesses and is propos­ing changes to the Com­pa­nies Act.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude stream­lin­ing and clar­i­fy­ing fi­nan­cial re­port­ing re­quire­ments for com­pa­nies and for­eign com­pa­nies, as well as re­mov­ing out­dated re­quire­ments and clar­i­fy­ing pro­vi­sions in the Act.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed leg­isla­tive changes in­clude grant­ing the reg­is­trar the power to ex­empt a com­pany from all re­quire­ments in the Ac­count­ing Stan­dards, and grant­ing the min­is­ter – Fi­nance Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat, in this case – the power to ex­empt classes of com­pa­nies from com­pli­ance with any or all the re­quire­ments in those stan­dards. They can in­stead re­quire a com­pany, or classes of com­pa­nies, to com­ply with other ac­count­ing stan­dards, Acra said.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent Ac­count­ing Stan­dards are pre­scribed by the Ac­count­ing Stan­dards Coun­cil, and com­prise the Sin­ga­pore Fi­nan­cial Re­port­ing Stan­dards (In­ter­na­tional), the Sin­ga­pore Fi­nan­cial Re­port­ing Stan­dards (SFRS) and the SFRS for Small En­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>Other pro­posed changes i nclude al­low­ing for­eign com­pa­nies to file fi­nan­cial state­ments in ac­cor­dance with ac­count­ing stan­dards that are “sub­stan­tially sim­i­lar” to Sin­ga­pore’s Ac­count­ing Stan­dards so as to re­duce com­pli­ance costs, the author­ity said.</p>
    <p>Acra has also sug­gested al­low­ing for­eign com­pa­nies with “in­signif­i­cant op­er­a­tions in Sin­ga­pore” to file unau­dited branch ac­counts, in­stead of an au­dited state­ment of as­sets, li­a­bil­i­ties and profit and loss in re­spect of the for­eign com­pany’s op­er­a­tions in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Acra, hav­ing “in­signif­i­cant op­er­a­tions in Sin­ga­pore” means that none of the firm’s to­tal rev­enue, to­tal ex­penses, to­tal as­sets or to­tal li­a­bil­i­ties in its unau­dited fi­nan­cial state­ments ex­ceeds $5 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, Acra is seek­ing com­ments on whether there are any con­cerns with al­low­ing such for­eign com­pa­nies to pre­pare a re­duced set of fi­nan­cial state­ments, and whether the pro­posed def­i­ni­tion of “in­signif­i­cant op­er­a­tions in Sin­ga­pore” is ap­pro­pri­ate.</p>
    <p>Acra has also pro­posed to re­move the re­quire­ment for pub­lic com­pa­nies lim­ited by shares to hold statu­tory meet­ings and their di­rec­tors to for­ward a statu­tory re­port to mem­bers prior to the meet­ing. This would re­duce com­pli­ance bur­den, and equiv­a­lent re­quire­ments in Aus­tralia, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Bri­tain have been abol­ished, Acra said.</p>
    <p>An­other sug­ges­tion in­cludes grant­ing the reg­is­trar the power to up­date changes in the ap­point­ments of di­rec­tors and sec­re­taries to main­tain the ac­cu­racy of in­for­ma­tion in those reg­is­ters.</p>
    <p>Lastly, Acra said it would like to clar­ify the date that the reg­is­trar strikes a com­pany off the reg­is­ter, or re­stores the com­pany’s name to the reg­is­ter, such that it co­in­cides with the date in­di­cated in Acra’s BizFile+ sys­tem, in­stead of the date pub­lished in the Gov­ern­ment Gazette.</p>
    <p>This pro­posed amend­ment would re­move am­bi­gu­ity over a com­pany’s le­gal sta­tus af­ter Acra has struck it off from the reg­is­ter or re­stored it to the reg­is­ter and be­fore such a no­tice is pub­lished, it said.</p>
    <p>Acra is the na­tional reg­u­la­tor of busi­ness en­ti­ties, pub­lic ac­coun­tants and cor­po­rate ser­vice providers in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic con­sul­ta­tion ex­er­cise runs till Aug 17.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic can ac­cess the con­sul­ta­tion doc­u­ments on Acra’s web­site at www.acra.gov.sg and the Reach por­tal at www.reach.gov.sg</p>
