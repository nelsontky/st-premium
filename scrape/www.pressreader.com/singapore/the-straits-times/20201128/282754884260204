    <p>• Pep Guardi­ola be­lieves Ser­gio Aguero will al­ways re­tain his preda­tory in­stincts in front of goal, as Manch­ester City hope the re­turn of the club’s record scorer will end their goal drought in the English top flight.</p>
    <p>City are off to their worst league start since the first few months of the club’s Abu Dhabi-backed own­er­ship in 2008.</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola’s men sit 13th in the Pre­mier League ta­ble – be­fore yes­ter­day’s fix­ture be­tween Crys­tal Palace and New­cas­tle – with seven goals in their last seven league games. Their neg­a­tive-one goal dif­fer­ence is their low­est at this stage of the sea­son since 2006-07 when they fin­ished 14th.</p>
    <p>Aguero missed the end of last sea</p>
    <p>FOX IN THE BOX</p>
    <p>son and most of the cur­rent cam­paign through in­jury. He re­turned at home to Arse­nal but picked up an­other prob­lem in the sub­se­quent game at West Ham.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he was a sub­sti­tute in Wed­nes­day’s 1-0 Cham­pi­ons League win over Olympiakos that booked City’s place in the last 16.</p>
    <p>“He’s go­ing to give us good mo­ments this sea­son,” said Guardi­ola. “He is still not in his best con­di­tion, we can­not for­get how long his in­jury was. He is a guy that needs to be so sharp. His qual­ity to score goals in the box al­ways was, al­ways is and al­ways will be, we don’t have doubts about that.”</p>
    <p>Aguero could be en­ter­ing his fi­nal few months in Manch­ester after nine years there, with his con­tract ex­pir­ing at the end of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola re­fused to com­ment on whether the 32-year-old will be of­fered a new deal, but said Aguero had earned the right to go out on his own terms.</p>
    <p>“He is a guy who de­serves with the club fair talks to de­cide what is the best for him, for the club, for ev­ery­one,” the City boss added.</p>
    <p>The Ar­gentina striker is in con­tention to fea­ture against Burn­ley in the Pre­mier League to­day, de­spite his fam­ily con­nec­tions to the death of com­pa­triot and leg­end Diego Maradona ear­lier this week.</p>
    <p>Maradona, whose daugh­ter Gian­inna was mar­ried to and has a child with Aguero, died at the age of 60 on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously the im­pact on the day of the game against Olympiakos was hard, es­pe­cially for his son,” said Guardi­ola. “Of course it was tough, it is nor­mal.</p>
    <p>“He knew Maradona quite well... (Diego was) his son’s grand­fa­ther. It is the sit­u­a­tion un­for­tu­nately for his fam­ily, (he) is OK, but it’s a ques­tion for him to an­swer, it’s dif­fi­cult for me to an­swer.”</p>
    <p>He con­firmed he had no fresh in­jury wor­ries ahead of the Clarets’ visit, with Fer­nand­inho, Benjamin Mendy and Olek­sandr Zinchenko re­turn­ing in mid­week, and sum­mer sign­ing Nathan Ake back in train­ing.</p>
    <p>He is a guy that needs to be so sharp. His qual­ity to score goals in the box al­ways was, al­ways is and al­ways will be, we don’t have doubts about that.</p>
