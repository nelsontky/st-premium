    <p>It is the new school year and many tod­dlers and pre-school­ers may feel ner­vous about meet­ing new teach­ers and friends, and be­ing away from home for hours.</p>
    <p>Fret not – help your lit­tle one calm down by read­ing sto­ries about what he is go­ing through.</p>
    <p>Books are not j ust great for in­tro­duc­ing new vo­cab­u­lary to kids, but can also ease their fears and anx­i­eties, says Ms Lynn Chua, deputy direc­tor of Chil­dren and Teen Ser­vices at the Na­tional Li­brary Board.</p>
    <p>That was how Ms Chua, 45, helped her only child, now 14, when he started pre-school and had sep­a­ra­tion anx­i­ety.</p>
    <p>She re­mem­bers read­ing sto­ries with sim­i­lar themes and hav­ing con­ver­sa­tions around them.</p>
    <p>“These can help your chil­dren come to terms (with the new hap­pen­ings) and also al­low you to un­der­stand how they are feel­ing,” says Ms Chua.</p>
    <p>When read­ing with your young child at home, she rec­om­mends find­ing a place away from dis­trac­tions such as the tele­vi­sion or where fam­ily mem­bers would be walk­ing past of­ten.</p>
    <p>Some stud­ies sug­gest that kids ben­e­fit from read­ing at least 20 min­utes a day.</p>
    <p>“But if your child can­not sit still for 20 min­utes, don’t force it. That can al­ways be made up of short five-minute ones through­out the day,” says Ms Chua.</p>
    <p>“As long as the in­ter­ac­tion is pos­i­tive, that is the most im­por­tant.”</p>
    <p>This is part of a se­ries where ex­perts give tips on how to get kids to love read­ing.</p>
