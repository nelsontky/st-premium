    <p>Banks are seen as the bell­wether of eco­nomic health. For Sin­ga­pore in­vestors, the three home­grown banks have also been safe and depend­able port­fo­lio hold­ings.</p>
    <p>For re­tail in­vestors, in par­tic­u­lar, they have been a source of sta­ble and gen­er­ous div­i­dends.</p>
    <p>Could all this change?</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has wreaked havoc on economies, cor­po­rates and peo­ple around the world. In re­cent weeks, var­i­ous coun­tries have re­ported their sharpest-ever quar­terly con­trac­tion in eco­nomic out­look.</p>
    <p>Ad­vance es­ti­mates show Sin­ga­pore’s sec­ond-quar­ter gross do­mes­tic prod­uct shrank 12.6 per cent year-on-year be­tween April and June as the im­pact of the cir­cuit breaker mea­sures hit home.</p>
    <p>Re­gional coun­tries – which form the main mar­kets for Sin­ga­pore’s three banks – have been sim­i­larly bat­tered.</p>
    <p>As the banks bore the brunt of the</p>
    <p>Covid-19 lock­downs on economies and busi­nesses, it was not sur­pris­ing that DBS has posted a 22 per cent drop in sec­ond-quar­ter earn­ings to $1.25 bil­lion, and United Over­seas Bank (UOB) saw its Q2 profit slump 40 per cent year-on-year to $703 mil­lion. And Oversea-Chi­nese Bank­ing Corp (OCBC) posted a larger-than-ex­pected 40 per cent plunge in Q2 net profit to $730 mil­lion on surg­ing pro­vi­sions and fall­ing in­ter­est rates.</p>
    <p>The big­gest fac­tor weigh­ing on earn­ings was net in­ter­est mar­gin (NIM), which mea­sures the net in­ter­est in­come banks get from loans, af­ter sub­tract­ing the cost of these funds. The NIM of all the three banks in the sec­ond quar­ter have been hit.</p>
    <p>DBS’ net in­ter­est in­come slipped 5 per cent to $2.3 bil­lion as a 7 per cent in­crease in loan vol­umes was eroded by the nar­row­ing of NIM to 1.62 per cent, from 1.86 per cent dur­ing the same quar­ter in 2019.</p>
    <p>At UOB, it fell 12 per cent to</p>
    <p>$1.46 bil­lion as loan growth of 3 per cent, mainly from Thai­land and Greater China, was eroded by</p>
    <p>NIM com­pres­sion to 1.48 per cent amid a fall­ing in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment. This is a sharp drop from the 1.81 per cent for the April-June pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>OCBC’s net in­ter­est in­come fell 7 per cent from the year-ago pe­riod to $1.48 bil­lion as NIM was com­pressed to 1.6 per cent, from 1.79 a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts cal­cu­late that a 10 ba­sis point fall in NIM could have a 6 per cent to 8 per cent im­pact on profit.</p>
    <p>On top of the NIM com­pres­sion, the lo­cal banks also suf­fered dips in fee in­comes, no thanks to fall­ing rev­enues on credit cards, trans­ac­tional fees, in­vest­ment bank­ing and gen­er­ally poor mar­ket con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>But all this is his­tory now.</p>
    <p>We are al­ready in the third quar­ter of the year. Go­ing for­ward, the big­gest chal­lenge will be twofold: non-per­form­ing loans (NPL) and de­clin­ing lend­ing.</p>
    <p>Liv­ing up to their con­ser­va­tive rep­u­ta­tions, all three have set aside pro­vi­sions for NPLs, which re­main in the 1.5 per cent to 1.6 per cent range. But an­tic­i­pat­ing bad loans, the banks, on av­er­age, have raised their al­lowance by some six­fold.</p>
    <p>DBS’ pro­vi­sion is 2.8 times that of last year, while UOB’s is 1.5 times and OCBC’s, 3.8 times.</p>
    <p>While there are signs of green shoots for the sec­ond half, a lot will de­pend on how eco­nomic and busi­ness con­di­tions pan out as gov­ern­ment stim­u­lus mea­sures wind down. Slug­gish busi­ness and eco­nomic con­di­tions will de­crease de­mand for bor­row­ings and raise the chances of loan de­faults.</p>
    <p>But for hold­ers of bank stocks, the big­gest shock came on July 29, when the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore (MAS) rec­om­mended that the three banks cap their FY2020 div­i­dend per share at 60 per cent of their FY2019 pay­out to shore up funds.</p>
    <p>The MAS also told banks to con­sider of­fer­ing share­hold­ers the op­tion to re­ceive their div­i­dend in the form of scrip (that is, shares) in­stead of cash.</p>
    <p>Not sur­pris­ingly, the an­nounce­ment sent the share prices of the three banks slid­ing by more than 3 per cent, though they have since re­cov­ered some ground.</p>
    <p>Still, MAS’ move is not unique. Reg­u­la­tors around the world have urged banks to con­serve cash amid the un­cer­tain­ties.</p>
    <p>But some might ques­tion the need for this mea­sure given how well-cap­i­talised, pru­dent and con­ser­va­tive the lo­cal banks are. DBS, for ex­am­ple, has re­serves amount­ing to 24 per cent above the min­i­mum re­quire­ments set by the cen­tral bank.</p>
    <p>The banks’ abil­ity to sus­tain div­i­dends has been a key strength un­der­pin­ning their stock price and en­abling them to re­main among the top 10 con­stituents of the FTSE De­vel­oped Asia Pa­cific ex Ja­pan Sus­tain­able Yield In­dex. Long-term av­er­age 10-year an­nu­alised to­tal re­turns of the three banks have av­er­aged 5.1 per cent through to this week.</p>
    <p>Last year, DBS, UOB and OCBC paid out $1.23, $1.10 and 53 cents re­spec­tively, trans­lat­ing into yields of be­tween 4.6 per cent and 6.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>But fol­low­ing MAS’ call, DBS’ quar­terly div­i­dend per share has been slashed by 40 per cent to 18 cent with a scrip op­tion, while UOB cut its in­terim DPS by 29 per cent to 39 cents with scrip op­tion avail­able. OCBC cut its in­terim div­i­dend to 15.9 cents per share, down from 25 cents a year ago.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts reckon the MAS’ rec­om­men­da­tion could trans­late into some 40 per cent cut in full-year div­i­dends.</p>
    <p>The div­i­dend cuts will en­able the banks to col­lec­tively save about $3 bil­lion, if the div­i­dend cap ap­plied over a 12-month pe­riod. As­sum­ing a 14 per cent Tier 1 ra­tio is kept, this would trans­late into around $20 bil­lion in new lend­ing.</p>
    <p>All this is good news for po­ten­tial bor­row­ers. But it is bad news for share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Alas, given the lack of depth in the lo­cal mar­ket, the bank stocks are a “must have” in most in­vest­ment port­fo­lios.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, share­hold­ers are left hop­ing that loans and cor­po­rate earn­ings growth pick up, while in­ter­est mar­gin com­pres­sion eases and macroe­co­nomic con­di­tions im­prove. If not, lower div­i­dends are here to stay for a while, whether or not cen­tral bankers ask for it.</p>
    <p>But in a re­port put out late on Thursday, in­vest­ment bank Gold­man Sachs said an ap­proval of a Covid-19 vac­cine by year end could up­end mar­kets and “chal­lenge mar­ket as­sump­tions both about cycli­cal­ity and about eter­nally neg­a­tive real rates”. Such a de­vel­op­ment, it said, should sup­port steeper yield curves, tra­di­tional cycli­cals and banks, while chal­leng­ing the lead­er­ship of tech­nol­ogy stocks.</p>
    <p>In short, if and when nor­mal­ity re­turns, bank stocks could fly.</p>
    <p>The div­i­dend cuts (rec­om­mended by the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore) will en­able the banks to col­lec­tively save about $3 bil­lion, if the div­i­dend cap ap­plied over a 12-month pe­riod. As­sum­ing a 14 per cent Tier 1 ra­tio is main­tained, this would trans­late into around $20 bil­lion in new lend­ing. All this is good news for po­ten­tial bor­row­ers. But it is bad news for share­hold­ers.</p>
