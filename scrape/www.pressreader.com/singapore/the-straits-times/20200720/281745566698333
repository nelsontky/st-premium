    <p>BARCELONA • The streets of Barcelona have emp­tied, after mil­lions of peo­ple were in­structed to stay at home amid new coro­n­avirus curbs fol­low­ing a spike in the num­ber of in­fec­tions in the past week.</p>
    <p>“It’s a disas­ter,” wailed Ms Maria Quin­tana, look­ing at her empty bar ter­race by the Sagrada Fa­milia in Spain’s sec­ond-largest city, where the num­ber of new cases has tripled to 800 in a week.</p>
    <p>In an an­nounce­ment last Fri­day, the Cata­lan re­gional gov­ern­ment urged nearly four mil­lion res­i­dents of met­ro­pol­i­tan Barcelona to stay home un­less ab­so­lutely nec­es­sary, ban­ning gath­er­ings of over 10 peo­ple and shut­ting cin­e­mas, the­atres and night­clubs.</p>
    <p>“We’d just started to see things com­ing back to life with the ar­rival of a few for­eign tourists, so this is a step back­wards,” Ms Quin­tana, 35, said over the week­end.</p>
    <p>“If they im­pose an­other l ock­down, I will drop the blind, but it might as well be drop­ping the blade of a guil­lo­tine on my own neck be­cause we won’t be able to sur­vive.”</p>
    <p>The new curbs came barely four weeks after Spain ended its state of emer­gency which sub­jected 47 mil­lion res­i­dents to one of the world’s tough­est lock­downs to slow the spread of a virus that has killed over 28,400 peo­ple in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The na­tional lock­down, which also saw Spain’s bor­ders closed, caused huge eco­nomic dam­age, par­tic­u­larly to the tourism sec­tor, which had hoped to re­coup some of its losses over the sum­mer.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, there were barely any tourists out­side the Sagrada Fa­milia, one of Spain’s most-vis­ited land­marks, and most of those were un­aware of the new re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>“There are not lot of peo­ple in the street, but we did not know,” said 23-year-old Karolina Ka­pounova from the Czech Republic, sweat­ing be­hind a face mask which is now oblig­a­tory in pub­lic at all times in most of Spain’s re­gions.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think we will change our sched­ule... But with (your) mouth cov­ered all the time and the heat, it’s a bit both­er­some.”</p>
    <p>Although the re­gional gov­ern­ment asked res­i­dents not to leave for their sec­ond homes, the traf­fic au­thor­i­ties reg­is­tered the de­par­ture of 350,000 ve­hi­cles head­ing for nearby coastal ar­eas.</p>
    <p>“It’s a mis­take,” Dr Ja­cobo Men­dioroz, the re­gion’s Covid-19 chief, told Rac1 ra­dio sta­tion. “The next step will be (manda­tory) home con­fine­ment.”</p>
    <p>The surge in new cases has led to fierce crit­i­cism of Cat­alo­nia’s proin­de­pen­dence re­gional gov­ern­ment for not be­ing bet­ter pre­pared.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the lock­down, the Cata­lan lead­er­ship had bit­terly crit­i­cised the cen­tral gov­ern­ment in Madrid, in­sist­ing they would have done a much bet­ter job if they had been in­de­pen­dent.</p>
