    <p>Those keen on be­ing at the bleed­ing edge of tech­nol­ogy and har­ness­ing it to en­gi­neer in­no­va­tions and make sci­en­tific dis­cov­er­ies can get ready to dive into the world of deep tech, as a slew of open­ings and op­por­tu­ni­ties to learn on the job are com­ing up at an SGIn­no­vate vir­tual fair this week­end.</p>
    <p>More than 30 deep tech star­tups and com­pa­nies will be of­fer­ing over 200 ap­pren­tice­ships and full-time po­si­tions for stu­dents, fresh grad­u­ates and even mid-career pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>The po­si­tions avail­able will in­clude tech­ni­cal roles in ar­eas such as soft­ware de­vel­op­ment and ro­bot­ics engi­neer­ing, as well as jobs in sales and busi­ness de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>The fair on Satur­day will give fur­ther in­sight to the deep tech in­dus­try through panel dis­cus­sions, show­cases by deep tech start-ups and free train­ing work­shops in ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and cy­ber se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Dr Lim Jui, chief ex­ec­u­tive of en­tre­pre­neur­ial or­gan­i­sa­tion SGIn­no­vate, said that amid Covid-19’s im­pact on the econ­omy, “we found a strong de­mand for spe­cialised roles that con­trib­ute to tech­nol­ogy de­vel­op­ment, which are es­sen­tial to fu­ture busi­ness growth. We fore­see at least 1,000 of such roles to be cre­ated and made avail­able”.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the vir­tual fair, SGIn­no­vate has also launched a new full­time deep tech trainee­ship pro­gramme known as Power X.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme is sup­ported by the Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion (NRF) Sin­ga­pore and aims to equip lo­cal tal­ent with es­sen­tial, re­al­world skills nec­es­sary for a new career in the deep tech space.</p>
    <p>“This pro­gramme will help our re­cent grad­u­ates and mid-career pro­fes­sion­als gain in-de­mand skills and ex­pe­ri­ence in this area, while sup­port­ing com­pa­nies who are look­ing to take on and train more em­ploy­ees,” said NRF chief ex­ec­u­tive Low Teck Seng.</p>
    <p>The first run, called Power X Ro­bot­ics, will groom trainees to be­come fu­ture ro­bot­ics en­gi­neers.</p>
    <p>The trainees will be guided by ex­perts and be part­nered with com­pa­nies such as Hope Tech­nik, Movel AI, NDR Med­i­cal Tech­nol­ogy, Poly­bee and Sesto Ro­bot­ics.</p>
    <p>The course will run over nine months, with trainees un­der­go­ing struc­tured for­mal train­ing with as­sess­ments and a cap­stone project in the first phase, and then do­ing full-time, on-the-job train­ing at at­tached com­pa­nies dur­ing the sec­ond phase. They can po­ten­tially be placed in full-time ro­bot­ics roles in their part­ner com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Movel AI chief ex­ec­u­tive and co­founder Ab­hishek Gupta said: “There is a high de­mand for good ro­bot­ics en­gi­neers, but most can­di­dates with a good foun­da­tion may lack es­sen­tial or in­dus­try skills to put this knowl­edge into prac­tice. Trainees who have ac­quired rel­e­vant skills through for­mal and hands-on train­ing will def­i­nitely be po­ten­tial can­di­dates for our team.”</p>
    <p>Train­ing fees are fully funded, and trainees will also re­ceive a monthly stipend of up to $4,000 dur­ing the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>This pro­gramme can be ex­panded to other deep tech do­mains in the fu­ture, such as cy­ber se­cu­rity, SGIn­no­vate said.</p>
    <p>NRF’s Mr Low added: “The launch of the Power X ini­tia­tive is timely, with the cur­rent chal­leng­ing eco­nomic cli­mate be­ing a press­ing con­cern for job seekers and em­ploy­ers. Ro­bot­ics is a grow­ing in­dus­try in Sin­ga­pore and there is de­mand for trained en­gi­neers who can carry out tech­nol­ogy trans­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“NRF will con­tinue to take stock of in­dus­try man­power needs and fo­cus on build­ing a strong Sin­ga­porean core of sci­en­tists and en­gi­neers through pro­grammes such as Power X.”</p>
    <p>Power X Ro­bot­ics is open to univer­sity grad­u­ates – es­pe­cially those with a back­ground in sci­ence, tech­nol­ogy, engi­neer­ing and math­e­mat­ics – with ba­sic pro­gram­ming skills and at least two years of full-time work­ing ex­pe­ri­ence in any field. Those keen can sign up at the SGIn­no­vate web­site by Oct 4.</p>
