    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • A rel­a­tively lowtech stock trade is mak­ing Tesla’s dizzy­ing rally look like an un­der­per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>In South-east Asia, mak­ers of rub­ber gloves are at­tract­ing more in­vestor fer­vour than even Mr Elon Musk’s elec­tric cars and flame throw­ers.</p>
    <p>Top Glove Cor­po­ra­tion – du­al­listed in Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia – is up 389 per cent this year in Kuala Lumpur, the most on the MSCI Asia-Pa­cific In­dex, while Su­per­max Cor­po­ra­tion has leapt more than 1,000 per cent, com­pared with Tesla’s 259 per cent.</p>
    <p>That is due to the boom in glove de­mand thanks to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, aided by a short-sell­ing ban in Malaysia till the year end.</p>
    <p>The me­te­oric rise has been un­prece­dented by Malaysian stan­dards, with the top three glove mak­ers adding about RM109 bil­lion (S$35.6 bil­lion) in com­bined mar­ket value this year.</p>
    <p>More than $1 of ev­ery $10 in­vested in the na­tion’s stock mar­ket right now is a bet on gloves – a feat that makes the South-east Asian na­tion a play on global hy­giene, much like South Korea and Tai­wan are for semi­con­duc­tors.</p>
    <p>Top Glove re­sumed its rally last Fri­day even after the US moved to block im­ports from two of its units.</p>
    <p>“The rally in glove mak­ers re­minds many of Tesla, but the sec­tor’s earn­ings out­look is more cer­tain than that of Tesla,” said Mr Ross Cameron, a fund man­ager at North­cape Cap­i­tal, which over­sees about US$7 bil­lion (S$9.7 bil­lion) in as­sets glob­ally.</p>
    <p>The short-sell­ing ban has had a mi­nor con­tri­bu­tion to the rally while “we ex­pect the sec­tor to re­port sig­nif­i­cantly more than 100 per cent earn­ings growth next year”, he said.</p>
    <p>Fund man­agers at North­cape and Sam­sung As­set Man­age­ment have in­creased their bets on the sec­tor this year, say­ing the shift in glove de­mand is struc­tural and many mar­ket par­tic­i­pants are still be­hind the curve.</p>
    <p>Still, a faster-than-ex­pected de­vel­op­ment of a vac­cine to treat Covid-19 risks putting the brakes on the spec­tac­u­lar rally in glove mak­ers’ shares.</p>
    <p>The US Cus­toms and Bor­der Pa­trol has placed a de­ten­tion or­der on dis­pos­able gloves made by Top Glove. Top Glove said in a state­ment ˇ lastThurs­day that the is­sue may be linked to for­eign labour and it is reach­ing out to US Cus­toms to seek to re­solve the mat­ter within two weeks.</p>
    <p>Fund man­agers and an­a­lysts said the com­pany could still ship its gloves to the US us­ing other units. Also, any can­cel­la­tion of or­ders would be off­set by de­mand from other coun­tries due to the acute short­age.</p>
    <p>For now, the or­der books have swelled, glove prices have sky­rock­eted and com­pa­nies are ag­gres­sively ex­pand­ing their ca­pac­ity to meet or­ders.</p>
