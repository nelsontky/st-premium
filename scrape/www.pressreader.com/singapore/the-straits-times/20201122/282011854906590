    <p>The Sun­day Times spoke to Ms Pek Hai Lin, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of Zero Waste SG, one of the more prom­i­nent non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tions here seek­ing to make Sin­ga­pore a zero-waste na­tion.</p>
    <p>Q: Tell us more about the work that Zero Waste SG is do­ing in S’pore.</p>
    <p>A: When Zero Waste SG was started, the whole idea was to bridge the huge knowl­edge-toac­tion gap in Sin­ga­pore when it comes to waste man­age­ment or mind­ful con­sump­tion. We have been do­ing dif­fer­ent things to bridge this gap, such as from try­ing to con­vince the Govern­ment to con­duct tri­als for sort­ing-at-source for re­cy­clables to ad­vo­cat­ing for a sin­gle-use car­rier bag charge.</p>
    <p>We also con­duct work­shops for schools, com­pa­nies and or­gan­i­sa­tions to raise aware­ness about dif­fer­ent is­sues, such as food waste.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing our work­shops, we show a video to ex­plain how cos­metic fil­ter­ing starts from farms and shapes con­sumer ex­pec­ta­tions down­stream, and in turn, af­fects how food is sup­plied or fil­tered up­stream.</p>
    <p>In the case of xiao bai cai, 15 per cent of less-than-per­fect, but still ed­i­ble, parts of the veg­eta­bles will be re­moved dur­ing the first round</p>
    <p>of fil­ter­ing at the farms, and an­other 10 per cent will be re­moved at the point of pack­ag­ing be­fore it goes to the su­per­mar­kets.</p>
    <p>By learn­ing about cos­metic fil­ter­ing, we hope t hat peo­ple would be more ac­cept­ing to­wards less-than-per­fect food and ap­pre­ci­ate the process of what hap­pens to food be­fore it reaches us, which can ul­ti­mately re­duce food waste in the long run.</p>
    <p>Q: What do you do to cut food waste in your life?</p>
    <p>A: I don’t cook of­ten, but when I do, I will com­post. I also up­cy­cle fruit peels into eco-en­zymes which can be used for clean­ing. I soak or­ange peels in vine­gar, and af­ter a few weeks, it can be used as a multi-pur­pose cleaner to clean sur­faces such as kitchen table­tops and win­dows.</p>
    <p>Q: What is your day-to-day job scope?</p>
    <p>A: I’m the ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor in an NGO (non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion), which means I do ev­ery­thing from part­ner­ships and ed­u­ca­tion to strate­gic plan­ning and me­dia re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Q: Have there been times when you wanted to give up what you were do­ing?</p>
    <p>A: Yes. An or­gan­i­sa­tion like ours does not only do ad­vo­cacy work, we also have to main­tain our op­er­a­tions, which is the tough part.</p>
    <p>We want to do many things, but we can­not af­ford to do ev­ery­thing. A lot of what we want to do does not gen­er­ate money, so it is about how we can cir­cum­vent that.</p>
    <p>Half of my work is about strate­gis­ing and be­ing cre­ative about how we can sus­tain our­selves mon­e­tar­ily. That is tir­ing and can be men­tally strain­ing.</p>
    <p>Q: What keeps you go­ing in what you do?</p>
    <p>A: I would say it is re­ally pas­sion. I joined Zero Waste SG at a point when change was hap­pen­ing.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple are start­ing to be­come more en­gaged, and the ur­gency of the sit­u­a­tion is caus­ing pos­i­tive re­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery time peo­ple are more aware, and a bit more okay with, for in­stance, su­per­mar­kets charg­ing for, or not pro­vid­ing, plas­tic bags, it paves the way for poli­cies.</p>
