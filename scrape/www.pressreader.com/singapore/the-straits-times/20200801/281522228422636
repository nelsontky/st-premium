    <p>Ini­tial in­ves­ti­ga­tions have shown that a trav­eller who tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 in South Korea af­ter tran­sit­ing in Changi Air­port was un­likely to have been in­fected in Sin­ga­pore, said the au­thor­i­ties yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“The source of in­fec­tion re­mains un­known and in­ves­ti­ga­tions by the var­i­ous au­thor­i­ties are on­go­ing,” said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) and the Civil Avi­a­tion Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (CAAS) in a joint state­ment.</p>
    <p>“As an added pre­cau­tion, con­tact trac­ing in Sin­ga­pore is also un­der way.”</p>
    <p>The man left New Zealand on July 21 and ar­rived in South Korea on July 22, when a poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test done four hours af­ter his ar­rival showed he was pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
    <p>The South Korean au­thor­i­ties sub­se­quently in­formed New Zealand that they sus­pected the man, who showed no symp­toms, had been in­fected dur­ing tran­sit at Changi Air­port. But this would have meant an in­cu­ba­tion pe­riod of less than 24 hours, the Sin­ga­pore au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, the av­er­age in­cu­ba­tion pe­riod for Covid-19 is five to six days, up to a max­i­mum of 14 days.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore is in con­tact with the New Zealand and South Korea au­thor­i­ties for fur­ther in­for­ma­tion,” said MOH and CAAS.</p>
    <p>The New Zealand Herald re­ported yes­ter­day that the in­fected per­son was a 22-year-old man who had trav­elled to var­i­ous parts of the coun­try, and had gone on a bus tour and a boat cruise.</p>
    <p>The health au­thor­i­ties there have been car­ry­ing out con­tact trac­ing and test­ing to rule out com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion, it said.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, strin­gent mea­sures are in place to en­sure that pas­sen­gers tran­sit­ing through Changi Air­port are seg­re­gated from all other pas­sen­gers at all stages of their jour­ney, the au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>Air­port staff wear per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment when in­ter­act­ing with pas­sen­gers, while pas­sen­gers are re­quired to wear masks at all times.</p>
    <p>“Safe dis­tanc­ing, tem­per­a­ture tak­ing for pas­sen­gers and staff are also en­forced,” they said. “All tran­sit pas­sen­gers, in­clud­ing those who had ar­rived on the same flight as the in­di­vid­ual, ad­hered to these pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers have been al­lowed to tran­sit in Changi Air­port since June 2. Upon their ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, tran­sit­ing pas­sen­gers are di­rected to spe­cial hold­ing ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Seats in these ar­eas are vac­u­umed and wiped reg­u­larly with dis­in­fec­tant, while fre­quently touched sur­faces have been sprayed with long-last­ing anti-mi­cro­bial dis­in­fec­tant coat­ing.</p>
    <p>Con­tact­less hand sani­tiser sta­tions are also avail­able.</p>
