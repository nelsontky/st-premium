    <p>SHAH ALAM • A po­lice in­spec­tor with RM1 mil­lion (S$330,000) in his bank ac­counts is among 29 Malaysian po­lice of­fi­cers be­ing probed by the cen­tral po­lice head­quar­ters for pos­si­ble as­so­ci­a­tion with al­leged crim­i­nal Addy Kanna.</p>
    <p>A po­lice­man with the rank of deputy com­mis­sioner is also un­der i nves­ti­ga­tion i n a re­lated case, said the po­lice’s In­tegrity and Stan­dard Com­pli­ance De­part­ment di­rec­tor Zamri Yahya.</p>
    <p>Addy, whose real name is Zaidi Kanapiah, has been de­tained since Oct 3 for sus­pected in­volve­ment in big-scale Ma­cau phone scams tar­get­ing vic­tims in China, il­le­gal on­line gam­bling, and work­ing with a for­eign scam syn­di­cate.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Addy and his al­leged as­so­ciate, Alvin Goh Leong Yeong, along with two po­lice of­fi­cers, were sen­tenced to two years in de­ten­tion un­der the Pre­ven­tion of Crime Act.</p>
    <p>Datuk Zamri said that the in­spec­tor, when queried about the RM1 mil­lion in his bank ac­counts, claimed that he had re­ceived it from his father.</p>
    <p>“We will in­ves­ti­gate the source of the money in more de­tail,” Mr Zamri told re­porters on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Ini­tial in­ves­ti­ga­tions in­volved four po­lice­men, but as the probe went on, more names were un­earthed.</p>
    <p>“Our in­ves­ti­ga­tion is on the as­pect of con­duct and dis­ci­pline. We are look­ing into their lifestyle, prop­erty own­er­ship, over­seas travel with­out per­mis­sion, and move­ments,” said Mr Zamri.</p>
    <p>“We hope to con­clude our in­ves­ti­ga­tions by next month.”</p>
    <p>Malaysia has re­cently been rocked by a ma­jor cor­rup­tion scan­dal in­volv­ing govern­ment of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>Last month, Malaysian graft busters seized a fleet of luxury cars, in­clud­ing a Rolls-Royce Phan­tom, a Ford Mus­tang and a Range Rover, in their probe into low-rank­ing im­mi­gra­tion of­fi­cers, who were earn­ing be­tween RM1,360 and RM4,052 a month.</p>
    <p>The cars added to an over­all haul that in­cluded more than RM800,000 in cash, 22 other luxury cars and four high-pow­ered mo­tor­cy­cles, as well as other as­sets such as houses, plots of land, jew­ellery and de­signer hand­bags.</p>
    <p>The seizures were part of an oper­a­tion that has led to the ar­rests of 50 peo­ple, in­clud­ing more than 30 im­mi­gra­tion of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cers were al­legedly in­volved in a syn­di­cate to al­low for­eign na­tion­als to fly freely in and out of Malaysia, by­pass­ing im­mi­gra­tion con­trols.</p>
