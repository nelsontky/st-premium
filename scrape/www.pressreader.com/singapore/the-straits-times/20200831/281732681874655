    <p>Tai­wan’s first l arge-scale test­ing pro­gramme for Covid-19 an­ti­bod­ies has yielded very en­cour­ag­ing re­sults, show­ing low ex­po­sure rates among par­tic­i­pants who were at higher risk of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme is a joint col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween Na­tional Tai­wan Univer­sity’s Col­lege of Pub­lic Health and the Changhua county govern­ment.</p>
    <p>Mass test­ing was con­ducted be­tween June 11 and Aug 12, tar­get­ing high-risk groups and a con­trol group.</p>
    <p>The high-risk groups com­prise peo­ple who had al­ready got Covid-19 and re­cov­ered, those who were in close con­tact with them such as med­i­cal staff, and peo­ple who went through home iso­la­tion af­ter re­turn­ing from over­seas.</p>
    <p>Changhua County Pub­lic Health Bureau di­rec­tor Yeh Yen-po an­nounced the re­sults last Thurs­day, say­ing that the study aimed to test par­tic­i­pants for neu­tral­is­ing an­ti­bod­ies af­ter they had been ex­posed to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The re­sults would in­di­cate the spread of the dis­ease is­land­wide in Fe­bru­ary and March, when con­firmed cases were rapidly in­creas­ing.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 4,841 high-risk par­tic­i­pants had their blood sam­ples an­a­lysed, with four of them test­ing pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>This equates to a pos­i­tive rate of 0.083 per cent, mean­ing that only 8.3 peo­ple out of 10,000 had been in­fected in a high-risk group for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>These re­sults show there is ex­tremely low risk of com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion in Tai­wan, said Mr Yeh.</p>
    <p>The low trans­mis­sion rate un­der­lines the suc­cess of the Cen­tral Epi­demic Com­mand Cen­tre’s dis­ease preven­tion ef­forts.</p>
    <p>“There is no need for uni­ver­sal screen­ing (in Tai­wan),” Mr Yeh con­cluded.</p>
    <p>He also dis­cussed an­other part of the study, in which re­searchers tested for an­ti­bod­ies in 18 con­firmed Covid-19 cases who were di­ag­nosed be­tween Jan­uary and April.</p>
    <p>All of them were found to still have neu­tral­is­ing an­ti­bod­ies.</p>
    <p>“It is es­pe­cially great news that they have re­tained an­ti­bod­ies even af­ter 100 days of con­tract­ing the virus,” Mr Yeh said.</p>
    <p>This means these peo­ple are more likely to be im­mune against the virus in the fu­ture, he noted.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan has kept the Covid-19 out­break un­der con­trol for months, thanks to the govern­ment’s im­po­si­tion of swift iso­la­tion and mas­sive pro­duc­tion of masks.</p>
    <p>As of Saturday, 488 cases of in­fec­tion and seven deaths had been recorded by the Tai­wan Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol since the is­land’s first case emerged in Jan­uary.</p>
