    <p>•</p>
    <p>South Korea has de­cided to toughen mea­sures as wor­ries rise over the third wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Dr Jeong Eun-kyeong, chief of the Korea Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion Agency, told a me­dia brief­ing yes­ter­day the coun­try’s re­pro­duc­tion rate of Covid-19 reached 1.43 last week, which sig­nals that one pa­tient can in­fect 1.5 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Dr Jeong noted that un­less the rate falls be­low one, the num­ber of con­firmed cases would con­tinue to grow faster. She added that the daily caseload could soar to a range of 700 to 1,000 in the next one or two weeks if the cur­rent rate of 1.43 is left un­changed.</p>
    <p>South Korea re­ported 438 new virus cases as at mid­night Sun­day, rais­ing the to­tal num­ber of in­fec­tions to 34,201, with 526 deaths.</p>
    <p>The daily caseload stayed be­low 500 for two days, but this was due to fewer tests at the week­end.</p>
    <p>The daily num­ber of con­firmed</p>
    <p>Covid-19 cases has grown in triple dig­its for 23 days run­ning since Nov 8, hov­er­ing above 300 af­ter Nov 18, ex­cept for Nov 23.</p>
    <p>The third wave was caused by small clus­ter in­fec­tions, es­pe­cially in the Seoul metropoli­tan area, trace­able to small gath­er­ings among fam­i­lies and ac­quain­tances, and to work­places, pub­lic bath­houses and sports fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment de­cided to raise its five-tier so­cial-dis­tanc­ing guide­lines to the third-high­est Level 2 from last Tues­day to Dec 7 in cap­i­tal Seoul and its sur­round­ing Gyeonggi prov­ince as part of ef­forts to con­tain the virus spread.</p>
    <p>De­spite the tight­ened rules, the resur­gence showed no sign of letup, lead­ing the gov­ern­ment to toughen mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment de­cided on Sun­day to keep the Seoul metropoli­tan area un­der the Level 2 dis­tanc­ing reg­u­la­tions, but ad­di­tional re­stric­tions were im­posed on gath­er­ings and ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The use of sauna and steam rooms in bath­houses is to be banned from to­day for one week in the metropoli­tan area, while nine types of ex­er­cises done in groups will be pro­hib­ited in in­door sports fa­cil­i­ties dur­ing the same pe­riod in the cap­i­tal re­gion.</p>
    <p>Singing lessons will be banned in the cited pe­riod in the Seoul area, while year-end or New Year par­ties will not be al­lowed at ho­tels, party rooms and guest houses, among other mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, South Korea’s rul­ing party has called for the pur­chase of mil­lions more Covid-19 vac­cine doses. The coun­try al­ready plans to se­cure doses to vac­ci­nate 30 mil­lion peo­ple, or about 60 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic Party law­mak­ers said they plan to al­lo­cate ad­di­tional funds to next year’s bud­get to buy vac­cine doses for at least 44 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
