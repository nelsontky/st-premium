    <p>Drugs worth about $640,000 were seized by the Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bu­reau (CNB) in a drug bust on Tues­day, in which two Sin­ga­pore­ans – a 30-year-old man and a 28-year-old wo­man – were ar­rested, said the au­thor­i­ties yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day af­ter­noon, CNB of­fi­cers ar­rested the man for sus­pected drug traf­fick­ing ac­tiv­i­ties in a res­i­den­tial es­tate in Boon Lay Drive.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cers took the man to his res­i­den­tial unit in the same es­tate, where the wo­man was also ar­rested.</p>
    <p>A search of the unit yielded 24 pack­ets and bot­tles con­tain­ing 1,203g of metham­phetamine, also known as Ice, 10g of cannabis, 512g of ke­tamine, 669 Ec­stasy tablets and 7,502 Erimin-5 tablets.</p>
    <p>Pack­ag­ing ma­te­ri­als and $8,680 in cash were also dis­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties then searched the man’s car, where they found three bun­dles con­tain­ing a to­tal of 1,500g of heroin.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions into the drug ac­tiv­i­ties of the sus­pects are on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>CNB said the 1,500g of heroin seized is suf­fi­cient to feed the ad­dic­tion of about 715 abusers for a week.</p>
    <p>The 1,203g of Ice seized could feed the ad­dic­tion of about 690 abusers for a week.</p>
