    <p>En­try re­stric­tions at four pop­u­lar mar­kets will be fur­ther eased start­ing to­mor­row, al­though there will be a cap on the num­ber of peo­ple al­lowed in at any one time, the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The four wet mar­kets are: Gey­lang Serai Mar­ket, Chong Pang Mar­ket at Block 104/105 Yishun Ring</p>
    <p>Road, the mar­ket at Block 20/21 Mar­sil­ing Lane, and the one at Block 505 Jurong West Street 52.</p>
    <p>With the eas­ing, these mar­kets will no longer have odd/even en­try re­stric­tions which cur­rently al­low peo­ple to visit only on al­ter­nate days on week­ends – de­pend­ing on the last digit of their iden­tity card num­ber.</p>
    <p>Other mea­sures such as the use of SafeEn­try for con­tact trac­ing pur­poses and the 1m dis­tance be­tween pa­trons will re­main in place.</p>
    <p>Since Aug 13 when the re­stric­tions were eased on week­days, the queue sit­u­a­tion out­side the mar­kets has been man­age­able and un­der con­trol, said the NEA.</p>
    <p>Out­side the mar­kets, there were ei­ther no queues or short to mod­er­ate queues ob­served on week­days, mostly at Gey­lang Serai Mar­ket and the mar­ket at Mar­sil­ing Lane.</p>
    <p>NEA has also ob­served a sig­nif­i­cant in­crease in the av­er­age daily foot­fall at all four mar­kets on week­days, rang­ing from be­tween 18 per cent and 48 per cent.</p>
    <p>“This has brought more busi­ness to the mar­ket stall­hold­ers while giv­ing more flex­i­bil­ity to pa­trons vis­it­ing these pop­u­lar mar­kets,” it said.</p>
    <p>Week­end queues were ob­served to be largely un­changed from what they were more than three weeks ago, with min­i­mal di­ver­sion of the week­end crowd to week­days.</p>
    <p>The long­est queues were spot­ted at Gey­lang Serai Mar­ket, with over 100 pa­trons in line, and Block 20/21 Mar­sil­ing Lane, with about 70 pa­trons in line.</p>
    <p>The other two mar­kets did not see any queues on week­ends.</p>
    <p>At their re­spec­tive peak hours at the two busier mar­kets, it took about 20 min­utes for a pa­tron to en­ter Gey­lang Serai Mar­ket and 15 min­utes for a pa­tron to en­ter the Mar­sil­ing Lane mar­ket, which NEA said was as­sessed to be “a man­age­able queue length”.</p>
    <p>The en­try re­stric­tions were first im­ple­mented across all four mar­kets on April 22.</p>
    <p>As wait­ing time to en­ter these mar­kets may be longer with the fur­ther eas­ing of the en­try re­stric­tions, shop­pers are ad­vised to visit these mar­kets dur­ing week­days and non­peak hours, and re­fer to Space Out (www.spa­ce­out.gov.sg) to check the crowd level, be­fore vis­it­ing.</p>
    <p>NEA added that it will con­tinue to mon­i­tor the mar­kets and if the queue sit­u­a­tion be­comes un­man­age­able, fur­ther tar­geted safe man­age­ment mea­sures may be in­tro­duced.</p>
