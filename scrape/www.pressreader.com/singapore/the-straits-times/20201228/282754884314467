    <p>LOS ANGELES • Michael Jack­son’s for­mer Nev­er­land Ranch in Cal­i­for­nia has re­port­edly been sold to Amer­i­can bil­lion­aire Ron Burkle at a steeply dis­counted price of around US$22 mil­lion (S$29 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>The late “King of Pop” fa­mously con­verted his sprawl­ing gated home into a fairy tale-themed re­treat – com­plete with toy rail­road, Fer­ris wheel and orang­utans – and penned some of his top hits on the ranch.</p>
    <p>But Nev­er­land was also the in­fa­mous lo­ca­tion where Jack­son in­vited chil­dren to visit and sleep over, and where he was ac­cused of mo­lest­ing young boys.</p>
    <p>It was re­branded as Sycamore Val­ley Ranch af­ter Jack­son died at 50 in 2009.</p>
    <p>Mr Burkle, a Mon­tana-based busi­ness­man with in­vest­ments rang­ing from su­per­mar­kets to the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try, pur­chased the ranch “as a land bank­ing op­por­tu­nity”, his spokesman said.</p>
    <p>The US$22 mil­lion price tag re­ported by the Wall Street Jour­nal – and con­firmed to Agence FrancePres­se as roughly ac­cu­rate by a source fa­mil­iar with the deal – would mark a dra­matic de­cline from the ranch’s US$100 mil­lion ask­ing price in 2015.</p>
    <p>That lofty fee, dubbed op­ti­mistic by real­tors even at the time, was slashed to US$31 mil­lion last year, but the ranch still did not sell and was taken off the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Mr Burkle was fly­ing in the re­gion re­cently to scout a neigh­bour­ing prop­erty as a pos­si­ble new branch of his Soho House pri­vate club net­work when he spot­ted the ranch and called its owner, ac­cord­ing to the spokesman.</p>
    <p>Jack­son had re­port­edly paid US$19.5 mil­lion for the prop­erty in the 1980s. Real es­tate in­vestor Thomas Bar­rack Jr’s Colony Cap­i­tal in­vest­ment firm pur­chased the ranch from the heav­ily i ndebted singer for US$22.5 mil­lion in the year be­fore his death.</p>
    <p>Mr Burkle pre­vi­ously worked as an ad­viser for the singer on busi­ness mat­ters, in­clud­ing re­solv­ing debts in­curred by his lav­ish life­style in the years be­fore his death.</p>
    <p>The 1,100ha es­tate, lo­cated 65km from Santa Bar­bara, fea­tures a main house with six bed­rooms along with three guest houses, a 1.6ha lake with a wa­ter­fall, ten­nis courts, sev­eral barns and an­i­mal shel­ter fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Jack­son’s ranch was raided in 2003 as part of a child mo­lesta­tion case against him. Po­lice at the time seized a large col­lec­tion of pornog­ra­phy and im­ages of nude chil­dren. He was ac­quit­ted in 2005.</p>
    <p>Last year, HBO doc­u­men­tary Leav­ing Nev­er­land aired tes­ti­monies of two men who claimed Jack­son had sex­u­ally abused them as chil­dren in rooms all over the ranch.</p>
    <p>The Jack­son es­tate – which is su­ing HBO for US$100 mil­lion over a “post­hu­mous char­ac­ter as­sas­si­na­tion” – de­nies all the al­le­ga­tions, as Jack­son did in his life­time.</p>
