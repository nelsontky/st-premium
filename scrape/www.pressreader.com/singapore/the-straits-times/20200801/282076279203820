    <p>PATRICK LIN, 30</p>
    <p>Se­nior staff nurse</p>
    <p>Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases’ In­ten­sive Care Unit</p>
    <p>Cold, white and silent. Pa­tients se­dated and hooked up to mul­ti­ple life­lines. The oc­ca­sional beep­ing of machines and call bells.</p>
    <p>These are the sights and sounds of a typ­i­cal in­ten­sive care unit (ICU), but se­nior staff nurse Patrick Lin, 30, does not want to de­scribe his work­place as som­bre.</p>
    <p>In­stead, he re­called his most memorable Covid-19 pa­tient in the ICU of the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases (NCID), whom he de­scribed as a “cheer­ful but slightly breath­less gentle­man”.</p>
    <p>“We built a rap­port very quickly dur­ing my shifts. He would talk to me about his job and fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“Some­times, I would pur­posely walk past his room to give him a thumbs up to en­cour­age him, and he would raise his hand at me.”</p>
    <p>In the mid­dle of his stay at the ICU, the pa­tient’s con­di­tion de­te­ri­o­rated and he had to be se­dated and in­tu­bated, said Mr Lin.</p>
    <p>But even­tu­ally, he be­came well enough to be trans­ferred to the gen­eral ward. “When he was be­ing wheeled out of the ICU, he saw me and said, ‘hey thanks’.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lin was one of more than 500 nurses from Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal (TTSH) de­ployed to NCID ear­lier this year. He was posted to the ICU from Fe­bru­ary to mid-June.</p>
    <p>In TTSH, he is part of the Nurs­ing Re­search Unit, now work­ing on Covid-19-re­lated ev­i­dence-based prac­tice and re­search.</p>
    <p>Trained as an ICU nurse, Mr Lin recog­nises that sep­a­ra­tion anx­i­ety is an is­sue that pa­tients and their fam­ily mem­bers face, as fam­i­lies are not al­lowed to en­ter the ICU. This is es­pe­cially the case for Covid-19 pa­tients in iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>He would try to re­as­sure fam­ily mem­bers when they ring the ICU.</p>
    <p>“My big­gest ful­fil­ment dur­ing my stint at NCID would be hav­ing the op­por­tu­nity to be with my pa­tients in the room dur­ing their most vul­ner­a­ble pe­riod, to be their stand-in grand­son, son or brother,” said Mr Lin.</p>
