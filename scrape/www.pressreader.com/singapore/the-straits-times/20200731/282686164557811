    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Superstar singer Madonna (right) has been cen­sored on In­sta­gram for spread­ing false in­for­ma­tion about a sup­posed cure for Covid-19 after she shared clips from a video also re-tweeted by United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>In her post to 15.4 mil­lion fol­low­ers, Madonna, 61, claimed that a proven vac­cine had been avail­able for months but it was be­ing kept se­cret “to let the rich get richer and the poor and sick get sicker”.</p>
    <p>She at­tached a video of US physi­cian Stella Im­manuel who praised hy­drox­y­chloro­quine as a mir­a­cle coro­n­avirus cure. Hy­drox­y­chloro­quine, an an­ti­malar­ial drug, has not been proved ef­fec­tive against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“We’ve re­moved this video for mak­ing false claims about cures and prevention meth­ods for Covid-19,” a com­pany spokesman for Face­book, which owns In­sta­gram, told Agence France-Presse on Wednes­day.</p>
    <p>Madonna’s post was deleted, but screen­grabs showed it had ear­lier been blurred by In­sta­gram and tagged “False In­for­ma­tion – re­viewed by in­de­pen­dent factcheck­ers” with a link to a page de­bunk­ing the video.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump this week tweeted sev­eral clips of the video to his 84 mil­lion fol­low­ers, be­fore the tweets were re­moved. His son Don­ald Trump Jr was tem­po­rar­ily halted from tweet­ing on Tues­day after he also shared parts of the video.</p>
    <p>Dr Im­manuel also railed against face masks and lock­downs.</p>
    <p>Madonna said in May she had re­cov­ered from the coro­n­avirus which forced her to pull out of con­certs in Paris ear­lier in the year.</p>
