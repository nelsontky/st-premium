    <p>Q What’s your worst in­vest­ment?</p>
    <p>A I in­vested about $50,000 in a movie project about five years ago. It was an emer­gency bridge loan with the prom­ise of a high-in­ter­est re­turn in a short time pe­riod be­cause the pro­duc­tion was run­ning short of funds.</p>
    <p>It was my first time in­vest­ing in a film project, and it was a pro­duc­tion com­pany which had some ex­cit­ing projects com­ing up in Sin­ga­pore and Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>I went into it think­ing that I would re­ceive about 30 per cent to 40 per cent re­turns on my money af­ter some time and that it was a good deal.</p>
    <p>The film was re­leased, but it did not get picked up by any dis­trib­u­tors so there was no money to be made. But the pro­duc­ers had a whole hi­er­ar­chy of in­vestors to pay off, and those peo­ple had in­vested a lot more than my $50,000. That’s when I re­alised that I should just stick to be­ing in front of the cam­era in­stead of in­vest­ing in film projects.</p>
    <p>Q And your best in­vest­ment?</p>
    <p>A I know this sounds corny but I would prob­a­bly say, in­vest­ing in my­self. We should do what­ever we can to im­prove and ed­u­cate our­selves, and I think that was one of the best de­ci­sions I have made.</p>
    <p>Go­ing to uni­ver­sity and tak­ing var­i­ous classes in ar­eas such as act­ing and Man­darin has opened many doors for me.</p>
    <p>Af­ter grad­u­at­ing from uni­ver­sity, I worked in a cou­ple of biotech firms, but I was un­happy and de­cided that I wanted to try and work for my­self. Around that time in 1997, I was laid off from my job in a start-up, which also turned out to be my last full-time of­fice job.</p>
    <p>That’s when I started tak­ing classes to be­come an ac­tor. Along the way, I got cer­ti­fied to be a per­sonal trainer as well, and tried set­ting my­self up for an en­tre­pre­neur­ial ca­reer track.</p>
