    <p>Some re­tir­ing hawk­ers who pre­vi­ously could not hand over their stalls to non-rel­a­tives will be al­lowed to do so un­der re­laxed rules, as a new scheme is rolled out to en­sure hawker cul­ture stays alive.</p>
    <p>The hawker suc­ces­sion scheme, pro­posed by a work group that was formed last year to sug­gest so­lu­tions to long­stand­ing prob­lems faced by hawk­ers, will match re­tir­ing hawk­ers with new en­trants to the pro­fes­sion.</p>
    <p>It widens the pool of peo­ple older hawk­ers can teach their recipes and pass their ex­pe­ri­ence to, no longer lim­it­ing their han­dover plans to only those in their fam­ily, who might not be as in­ter­ested to carry on with the trade.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment by the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) comes af­ter an ex­pert in­ter­na­tional panel last week rec­om­mended that Sin­ga­pore’s hawker cul­ture be put on the Unesco in­tan­gi­ble her­itage list.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cial re­sults on this will be</p>
    <p>an­nounced next month.</p>
    <p>If the nom­i­na­tion is suc­cess­ful, Sin­ga­pore must sub­mit a re­port to Unesco ev­ery six years on its ef­forts to safe­guard hawker cul­ture.</p>
    <p>The NEA said the new scheme ap­plies to “a small sub­set” among the 600 cooked-food hawk­ers who cur­rently do not have their rentals sub­sidised, and 300 who are pay­ing sub­sidised rental fees.</p>
    <p>More de­tails will be an­nounced in the first quar­ter of next year when the scheme is pi­loted.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, only hawk­ers who have their rentals sub­sidised can as­sign their stalls to non-rel­a­tives.</p>
    <p>Mr Ed­ward Chia, an MP for Hol­land-Bukit Timah GRC and cochair­man of the work group that pro­posed the scheme, said there are many vet­eran hawk­ers who have no one to hand over their brands and recipes to. “We felt that this was some­thing that was no­table. It will be such a waste if some of these recipes for good food dis­ap­pear from the hawker scene.</p>
    <p>“The suc­ces­sion pro­gramme is tar­geted at those who want to hand over their recipes but can’t find suc­ces­sors,” said Mr Chia, who is also man­ag­ing direc­tor of Tim­bre Group.</p>
    <p>Once el­i­gi­ble hawk­ers ap­ply for the scheme, the NEA, ad­vised by an in­de­pen­dent panel, will fa­cil­i­tate the match­ing of com­pat­i­ble hawk­ers.</p>
    <p>The plan for now is for the suc­ces­sion scheme to be re­stricted to those who have at least 15 years of ex­pe­ri­ence op­er­at­ing their stalls in hawker cen­tres, the NEA added.</p>
    <p>There is a longer-term hope that the scheme will help the pro­fes­sion at­tract younger hawk­ers, with the me­dian age of hawk­ers cur­rently be­ing 59.</p>
    <p>The work group found that there con­tin­ues to be neg­a­tive pub­lic per­cep­tion of the hawker trade, and hopes to “re­fresh the nar­ra­tive” and cel­e­brate hawker cul­ture fur­ther so the younger gen­er­a­tion sees be­ing a hawker as a vi­able ca­reer.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim Gek Meng, a hawker of nearly 40 years who also co-chairs the work group, said the suc­ces­sion scheme tack­les a prob­lem that he also faces. He took over his fa­ther’s fish­ball noo­dle busi­ness, but is now un­sure if his chil­dren will run it af­ter he re­tires.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim, chair­man of the Chi­na­town Com­plex hawk­ers’ As­so­ci­a­tion, said in Man­darin: “Suc­ces­sion is a very se­ri­ous prob­lem for hawk­ers. It is not an easy pro­fes­sion, as we have to wake up early, re­turn home late and wash dishes. Stalls can also be quite hot and hu­mid. It is a dif­fi­cult en­vi­ron­ment.”</p>
    <p>The work group had pro­gres­sively sug­gested sev­eral schemes to the au­thor­i­ties and some of these have al­ready been im­ple­mented.</p>
    <p>A hawk­ers’ de­vel­op­ment pro­gramme, which of­fers sub­sidised train­ing fees, paid ap­pren­tice­ship and al­lo­ca­tion of sub­sidised stalls to as­pir­ing hawk­ers, was launched in Jan­uary this year.</p>
    <p>Close to 150 par­tic­i­pants have com­pleted the train­ing stage of this pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Amy Khor, who vis­ited Ghim Moh Food Cen­tre with Mr Chia and Mr Lim yes­ter­day, said the rec­om­men­da­tions to sus­tain the hawker trade and keep hawker cul­ture vi­brant were timely and fea­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“We will re­view the re­port by the work group and im­ple­ment other ideas of­fered in the re­port in due course,” she said.</p>
