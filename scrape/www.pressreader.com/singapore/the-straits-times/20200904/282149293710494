    <p>It’s good to see that mem­bers of the pub­lic are start­ing to ap­pre­ci­ate the value that en­trepreneur­s bring to the econ­omy (New min­istry needed to spur in­no­va­tion and start-ups in Sin­ga­pore, by Ms Loh Kah Lan, Aug 19).</p>
    <p>It is also good to see that Ms Loh ap­pre­ci­ated many of the ob­sta­cles and ob­jec­tions that peo­ple may en­counter when choos­ing the path of an en­tre­pre­neur.</p>
    <p>How­ever, I don’t be­lieve cre­at­ing a new min­istry would help give birth to more home-grown en­trepreneur­s. En­trepreneur­s can­not be made to or­der in the same way that you might cre­ate assem­bly work­ers for a fac­tory.</p>
    <p>The best en­trepreneur­s are in­evitably self-starters. Mi­crosoft’s Bill Gates and Ap­ple’s Steve Jobs, for ex­am­ple, are the kind of men driven by a vi­sion and who learn the ropes the hard way, through the school of hard knocks.</p>
    <p>They did not be­come en­trepreneur­s by ap­ply­ing to govern­ment schemes.</p>
    <p>The re­al­ity is that be­ing an en­tre­pre­neur is tough. The chances of fail­ure are higher than the chances of suc­cess. Most fa­mous en­trepreneur­s have failed at least once. Yet the ben­e­fits to so­ci­ety are im­mense. Those who suc­ceed are more re­silient be­cause they’ve suf­fered hard knocks. Those who fail also pick up skills that don’t get taught in a class­room.</p>
    <p>This is not to say that gov­ern­ments can­not help en­trepreneur­s. They can do so by mak­ing laws re­lat­ing to clos­ing and start­ing busi­nesses, as well as ob­tain­ing credit, sim­pler or more en­tre­pre­neur-friendly so that en­trepreneur­s can start again if they fail in their first ven­ture.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments can en­cour­age com­mu­nity pro­grammes that pro­vide en­trepreneur­s with ac­cess to men­tor­ship. One good ex­am­ple is ideas­inc, a com­pe­ti­tion or­gan­ised by NTUi­tive, a wholly owned sub­sidiary of Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity that not only of­fers as­pir­ing en­trepreneur­s cash prizes but also pro­vides them with ac­cess to men­tor­ship, which in turn in­creases their chances of suc­cess.</p>
    <p>En­trepreneur­ship should not be an easy op­tion and the choice to be an en­tre­pre­neur should come from the in­di­vid­ual.</p>
    <p>A com­mu­nity can sup­port an en­tre­pre­neur by en­sur­ing that he has rea­son­able ac­cess to things like fund­ing and op­por­tu­ni­ties to find men­tors. How­ever, the suc­cess or fail­ure of an en­trepreneur­ial jour­ney must be ul­ti­mately owned by the in­di­vid­ual en­tre­pre­neur.</p>
