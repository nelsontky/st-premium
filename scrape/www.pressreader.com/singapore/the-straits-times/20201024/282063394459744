    <p>The death of a 13-year-old girl who fell from height af­ter crash­ing into a rail­ing while rid­ing a fixed-gear bi­cy­cle has been ruled a mis­ad­ven­ture.</p>
    <p>De­liv­er­ing her find­ings yes­ter­day, State Coroner Ka­mala Pon­nam­palam also said there is an on­go­ing review of the use of such bi­cy­cles, which some have said are not suitable for the young as strength and skill are needed to ma­noeu­vre them.</p>
    <p>Fixed-gear bi­cy­cles gen­er­ally do not have hand-op­er­ated brakes, and rely on the rider’s pedal re­sis­tance to come to a halt.</p>
    <p>The re­port from the review is ex­pected to be out by the year end.</p>
    <p>The coroner said the girl’s death is a “cau­tion­ary tale” that has raised con­cerns over the use of fixed-gear bi­cy­cles – also known as fix­ies.</p>
    <p>The girl had been rid­ing the fixedgear bi­cy­cle, which did not have brakes, with her school­mates at a multi-storey carpark in Pasir Ris on Jan 8 when the in­ci­dent oc­curred.</p>
    <p>She had learnt how to ride a con­ven­tional bi­cy­cle only about a year ago, and had wanted to try rid­ing the fixed-gear bi­cy­cle.</p>
    <p>Her friends low­ered the seat of the bi­cy­cle, but the 1.53m-tall girl was still “too short” for the seat height of 1.03m af­ter ad­just­ment, said the coroner.</p>
    <p>A friend orig­i­nally ac­com­pa­nied her on foot as the girl started rid­ing, and the girl said she was not con­fi­dent about rid­ing as it had been some time since she last rode a bi­cy­cle. But the friend could not keep up when the girl started cy­cling down a ramp from the sev­enth floor to the sixth floor.</p>
    <p>The friend shouted for the girl to turn right, but the girl con­tin­ued to move straight to­wards the metal rail­ing and col­lided with it, said the coroner.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult of the im­pact, the girl was thrown over the rail­ing, the court heard. The fixed-gear bi­cy­cle was stopped by the rail­ing and fell to the ground.</p>
    <p>The girl was pro­nounced dead on the scene by paramedics.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing this in­ci­dent, the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) said it would look into the is­sue of fixedgear bi­cy­cles. It had pre­vi­ously treated them as nor­mal bi­cy­cles with no re­stric­tions to their use, said the coroner.</p>
    <p>The coroner noted that the LTA’s view was that the bi­cy­cles are not in­her­ently un­safe.</p>
    <p>But she also cited Mr Zulk­i­fli Awab, an avid cy­clist and founder of pop­u­lar cy­cling group HolyCrit, who has stated that fixed-gear bi­cy­cles are not for the young, in­ex­pe­ri­enced or un­fit.</p>
    <p>He has also said that rid­ers of such bi­cy­cles need to be pro­fi­cient in han­dling the bi­cy­cle, and must have “suf­fi­cient leg power” to em­ploy the backpedall­ing method to bring the bi­cy­cle to a stop, noted the coroner.</p>
    <p>The coroner said there should be public ed­u­ca­tion ef­forts to high­light the dan­gers of rid­ing such bi­cy­cles. This was among the rec­om­men­da­tions that arose from the inquiry into the girl’s death.</p>
    <p>The coroner ex­tended her con­do­lences to the fam­ily of the girl.</p>
