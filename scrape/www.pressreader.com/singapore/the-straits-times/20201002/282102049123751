    <p>Doc­tors in pri­vate prac­tice are con­cerned that some pa­tients may be re­luc­tant to seek treat­ment in a pri­vate hospi­tal be­cause of a change pro­posed in MediShield Life ear­lier this week.</p>
    <p>The MediShield Life Coun­cil, which was set up to re­view the na­tional health in­sur­ance plan, among other things, rec­om­mended on Tues­day that the cap on claims for pri­vate hospi­tal bills be cut from 35 per cent to 25 per cent from early next year. If im­ple­mented, the change may af­fect the pri­vate in­te­grated plans (IPs) of­fered by seven in­sur­ers which in­cor­po­rate MediShield Life.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the in­sur­ers may in­crease their IP pre­mi­ums, and pol­i­cy­hold­ers will have to pay more for treat­ment in pri­vate hos­pi­tals, the pri­vate doc­tors told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“In­creased I P pre­mi­ums will force pa­tients, es­pe­cially the mid­dle class and heart­landers, to aban­don their cur­rent IPs and move to lower-tier plans, and seek treat­ment at pub­lic hos­pi­tals,” said Dr Des­mond Wai, a gas­troen­terol­o­gist at Mount El­iz­a­beth Novena Spe­cial­ist Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The doc­tors also said that if more pa­tients shift to pub­lic hos­pi­tals, there would be a greater bur­den on restruc­tured hos­pi­tals and pa­tients may not be able to get timely treat­ment.</p>
    <p>Dr Chuang Hsuan-Hung, a car­di­ol­o­gist and med­i­cal di­rec­tor of the Asian Heart and Vas­cu­lar Cen­tre, said: “Both the pub­lic and pri­vate health­care sec­tors have a part to play in serv­ing the needs of the com­mu­nity. It’s not an ar­gu­ment on which sys­tem is bet­ter or cheaper, but it is a recog­ni­tion that the pub­lic health­care sys­tem is more over­whelmed.”</p>
    <p>Dr Christo­pher Chong, an ob­ste­tri­cian and gy­nae­col­o­gist at Gle­nea­gles Hospi­tal, added: “This is es­pe­cially so dur­ing the Covid-19 pe­riod as pub­lic hos­pi­tals are the first line of de­fence.”</p>
    <p>Dr Chuang cited the case of a pa­tient who went to the emer­gency depart­ment of a pub­lic hospi­tal for chest pain re­cently, and was given a fol­low-up ap­point­ment in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter con­sult­ing his fam­ily and look­ing at in­sur­ance, he de­cided to see us quickly. His main artery had a 90 per cent block­age,” the car­di­ol­o­gist added, and he was given “timely” treat­ment.</p>
    <p>The MediShield Life Coun­cil pro­posed the change in pay­outs be­cause it said that at 35 per cent pro­ra­tion, a pri­vate hospi­tal bill is more ex­pen­sive than the same pro­ce­dure in a sub­sidised ward.</p>
    <p>Poorer pa­tients get­ting sub­sidised care are there­fore un­der­writ­ing the more ex­pen­sive, pri­vate care of wealth­ier pa­tients in pri­vate hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>Far­rer Park Hospi­tal said it is too early to as­cer­tain the im­pact of the pro­posed changes.</p>
    <p>“We en­deav­our to do what’s best and right for the pa­tients, and within the coun­cil’s guide­lines,” the pri­vate hospi­tal said, in re­sponse to ques­tions from ST.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Zhu Wen­jun from Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s busi­ness school said the eco­nomic ra­tio­nale be­hind the lower cap is for more ef­fi­cient util­i­sa­tion of govern­ment trans­fer pay­ments, so that all Sin­ga­pore­ans can have ac­cess to af­ford­able and high­qual­ity health­care.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients who opt for pri­vate A or B1 class treat­ment in pub­lic hos­pi­tals will con­tinue to get 35 per cent of their bills cov­ered by MediShield Life.</p>
    <p>Prof Zhu also said it is un­clear for now if the re­duc­tion will lead to sig­nif­i­cant shifts in pa­tient be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>“We will need to wait and see re­sponses from the mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>Cost may not be the only con­sid­er­a­tion when pa­tients opt for treat­ment at a pri­vate hospi­tal, said Dr Daryl Tan, a haema­tol­o­gist at Mount El­iz­a­beth Novena Spe­cial­ist Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Shorter wait­ing times, fre­quent per­son­alised at­ten­tion and care, di­rect ac­cess to pri­mary doc­tors dur­ing emer­gen­cies, and ease of ad­mis­sion due to lower in-pa­tient oc­cu­pancy rates are other rea­sons, he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Wai said pri­vate doc­tors could be­come more pru­dent and con­sider more cost-ef­fec­tive treat­ment plans with lower pay­outs.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully, this helps weed out un­nec­es­sary pro­ce­dures and surg­eries,” he said.</p>

        <p data-role="text">There would be a greater bur&#xAD;den on restruc&#xAD;tured hos&#xAD;pi&#xAD;tals, like Tan Tock Seng Hospi&#xAD;tal (right), if more pa&#xAD;tients shift away from pri&#xAD;vate hos&#xAD;pi&#xAD;tals, like Mount El&#xAD;iz&#xAD;a&#xAD;beth Novena Hospi&#xAD;tal, said some pri&#xAD;vate doc&#xAD;tors.</p>
