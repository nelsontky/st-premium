    <p>TOKYO • The post­pone­ment of the Tokyo Olympic Games un­til next year be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic will cost Ja­panese or­gan­is­ers an ad­di­tional 294 bil­lion yen (S$3.8 bil­lion), the or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers have been as­sess­ing the fi­nan­cial im­pact of the de­lay since the Ja­panese gov­ern­ment and In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC) de­cided in March to push back the Games for the first time un­til next July.</p>
    <p>Op­er­a­tional costs re­lated to the de­lay will run to around 198 bil­lion yen, while Covid-19 coun­ter­mea­sures, in­clud­ing the im­ple­men­ta­tion of a test­ing sys­tem, and procur­ing equip­ment for in­fec­tion con­trol will cost an ex­tra 96 bil­lion yen.</p>
    <p>The virus coun­ter­mea­sures, how­ever, will be fully cov­ered by the Ja­panese gov­ern­ment to the tune of 56 bil­lion yen and an­other 40 bil­lion yen from the Tokyo met­ro­pol­i­tan gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Tokyo 2020 or­gan­is­ers are also falling back on a con­tin­gency fund of 27 bil­lion yen de­tailed in last year’s bud­get to cover the costs, while seek­ing fresh funds via spon­sor­ship and in­surance claims.</p>
    <p>The Tokyo met­ro­pol­i­tan gov­ern­ment is ex­pected to pay a to­tal of 120 bil­lion yen, the or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee 103 bil­lion yen and the Ja­panese gov­ern­ment 71 bil­lion yen, or­gan­is­ers said.</p>
    <p>The IOC has pre­vi­ously said it will con­trib­ute US$650 mil­lion (S$865.8 mil­lion) to­wards cov­er­ing post­pone­ment costs and this sum is sep­a­rate from the costs an­nounced by Ja­panese or­gan­is­ers.</p>
    <p>“Tokyo’s costs are Tokyo’s costs,” Tokyo 2020 chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Toshiro Muto said. “Tokyo 2020’s (al­lo­ca­tion) is rev­enue that we can se­cure.</p>
    <p>“Within this rev­enue, we have ad­di­tional spon­sor­ship that we have re­quested from part­ners and we also have in­surance.”</p>
    <p>Tokyo 2020 pres­i­dent Yoshiro</p>
    <p>Mori added that the IOC had agreed to waive any ad­di­tional roy­al­ties ac­crued by new spon­sor­ship deals se­cured by the or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>“I had a video con­fer­ence (call) last night with IOC pres­i­dent (Thomas) Bach,” said Mori, who was wear­ing a red-and-white mask with the words “One Team” on the side, the slo­gan of the Ja­panese rugby team dur­ing last year’s World Cup.</p>
    <p>“Pres­i­dent Bach ex­pressed his strong de­ter­mi­na­tion that the IOC and us should work as one team and co­op­er­ate to en­sure the suc­cess of the Games.”</p>
    <p>The last of­fi­cial bud­get given by the or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee last De­cem­ber, months be­fore the Games were post­poned, was US$12.6 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing over­shot the bud­get, more spend­ing could har­den pub­lic opin­ion in the coun­try, es­pe­cially as the bulk of the costs are ex­pected to be borne by Ja­panese tax­pay­ers.</p>
    <p>Polls done as re­cently as Au­gust still show a size­able num­ber of re­spon­dents in favour of an­other post­pone­ment or can­cel­la­tion.</p>
