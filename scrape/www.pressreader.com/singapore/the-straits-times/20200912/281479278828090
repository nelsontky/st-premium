    <p>HEROES IN A TIME OF CRI­SIS</p>
    <p>This has been an es­pe­cially dif­fi­cult year for ev­ery­one. But through it all, there have also been many mo­ments when the com­mu­nity came to­gether in the face of a cri­sis... So our search for nom­i­nees will aim to show­case the ef­forts of in­di­vid­u­als and groups in Sin­ga­pore that stepped up in the face of chal­lenges and ad­ver­si­ties to try to do their part to make things bet­ter for oth­ers.’’</p>
    <p>MR WAR­REN FER­NAN­DEZ, editor-in-chief of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’</p>
    <p>English/ Malay/Tamil Me­dia Group and editor of The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The search is on to find this year’s Sin­ga­porean of the Year.</p>
    <p>In its sixth edi­tion now, The Straits Times Sin­ga­porean of the Year, pre­sented by UBS, is an an­nual award given to a Sin­ga­porean in­di­vid­ual or group that has made a pos­i­tive and sus­tain­able im­pact in so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Said Mr War­ren Fer­nan­dez, ed­i­torin-chief of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’ English/Malay/Tamil Me­dia Group and editor of The Straits Times: “This has been an es­pe­cially dif­fi­cult year for ev­ery­one. But through it all, there have also been many mo­ments when the com­mu­nity came to­gether in the face of a cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“So our search for nom­i­nees will aim to show­case the ef­forts of in­di­vid­u­als and groups in Sin­ga­pore that stepped up in the face of chal­lenges and ad­ver­si­ties to try to do their part to make things bet­ter for oth­ers.”</p>
    <p>The award has been given in pre­vi­ous years to those whose achieve­ments put Sin­ga­pore on the world stage, such as the 2016 re­cip­i­ent – swim­mer Joseph School­ing, who won the coun­try’s first Olympic gold medal, and his par­ents.</p>
    <p>It has also been awarded to re­cip­i­ents who im­proved the lives of oth­ers in the com­mu­nity, or dis­played re­silience in the face of ad­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the 2018 award went to Ms Siti Noor Mas­tura, who co-founded non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion In­ter­faith Youth Cir­cle, which pro­motes bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of the role that faith groups can play in an in­creas­ingly com­plex and di­vided world.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob, who is the pa­tron of the award, said last year that the award was a “call for ac­tion to Sin­ga­pore­ans to cre­ate a pos­i­tive im­pact to the com­mu­nity”.</p>
    <p>The 2019 re­cip­i­ent was As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Angie Chew, who started Brahm Cen­tre in 2012 to pro­vide free health ed­u­ca­tion, as well as other ser­vices such as be­friend­ing, coun­selling and de­men­tia screen­ing for se­niors who are frail and lonely.</p>
    <p>From now un­til Dec 15, the pub­lic can nom­i­nate can­di­dates for the award via str.sg/so­ty20nom­i­nate</p>
    <p>Nom­i­nees must be Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens who made the news this year.</p>
    <p>Short­listed can­di­dates will be un­veiled in batches over the com­ing weeks till De­cem­ber, af­ter which there will be two weeks of pub­lic vot­ing. The out­come of the vote will be used as a ref­er­ence by the judges in mak­ing the fi­nal de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>A panel of judges com­pris­ing Straits Times edi­tors, UBS rep­re­sen­ta­tives and in­di­vid­u­als who have made their mark in var­i­ous fields will help rec­om­mend and se­lect de­serv­ing can­di­dates, and pick the Sin­ga­porean of the Year.</p>
    <p>The award will be given out in Fe­bru­ary next year. The re­cip­i­ent will get a tro­phy and $20,000, pre­sented by UBS which has sup­ported the award right from its be­gin­nings.</p>
    <p>Mr Ed­mund Koh, pres­i­dent of UBS Asia-Pa­cific of UBS Group and UBS, noted the award’s sig­nif­i­cance this year. “This year’s The Straits Times Sin­ga­porean of the Year Award 2020, pre­sented by UBS, is ex­traor­di­nar­ily spe­cial given the un­prece­dented Covid-19 pandemic and the many chal­lenges it has thrown up.</p>
    <p>“It is es­pe­cially dur­ing such try­ing times that we see the ex­tra­or­di­nary strength and courage in the peo­ple around us who have dis­played re­mark­able al­tru­ism and care for oth­ers as they seek to build re­silience in the com­mu­nity,” he added.</p>
    <p>The top award re­cip­i­ent will also re­ceive a pair of busi­ness class tick­ets spon­sored by Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) to any­where that SIA or its sub­sidiary air­line SilkAir flies to.</p>
    <p>SIA chief ex­ec­u­tive Goh Choon Phong said: “It is im­por­tant, es­pe­cially dur­ing these dif­fi­cult times, to come to­gether to cel­e­brate our peo­ple and the tri­umph of the hu­man spirit. This will help us emerge as an even stronger and more re­silient na­tion as we over­come our cur­rent chal­lenges.”</p>
    <p>Mil­len­nium Ho­tels and Re­sorts will be gift­ing the re­cip­i­ent a fivenight stay in any of its global prop­er­ties. Mil­len­nium Ho­tels and Re­sorts is the global brand of Mil­len­nium & Copthorne Ho­tels (M & C), a global ho­tel com­pany which owns, man­ages and op­er­ates over 145 ho­tels across some 80 lo­ca­tions world­wide.</p>
    <p>Mr Kwek Leng Beng, ex­ec­u­tive chair­man of Mil­len­nium & Copthorne Ho­tels, said: “Dur­ing this dif­fi­cult time when many peo­ple have been im­pacted by the coronaviru­s pandemic, it is even more im­por­tant for us to show our sup­port for the self­less Sin­ga­pore­ans who have stepped for­ward to give back to the com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>If there is more than one in­di­vid­ual re­ceiv­ing the top award, M&C will spon­sor up to three sets of ac­com­mo­da­tion and SIA will spon­sor up to three pairs of busi­ness class tick­ets.</p>
    <p>The panel of judges is chaired by Mr Fer­nan­dez and co-chaired by Mr Koh, whose sup­port helped get the award off the ground.</p>
    <p>Another pan­el­list is Mr Au­gust Hate­cke, UBS’ coun­try head of Sin­ga­pore and co-head of wealth man­age­ment in Asia-Pa­cific.</p>
