    <p>The build­ing and open­ing of more al­lot­ment gar­dens is nicely timed to meet the ris­ing in­ter­est in ur­ban farm­ing and gardening (NParks re­leas­ing over 280 gardening plots in 4 parks, Nov 14).</p>
    <p>The Gardening With Edi­bles ini­tia­tive launched in June by the Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) had such over­whelm­ing re­sponse that the num­ber of seed pack­ets dis­trib­uted was in­creased from 150,000 to 400,000.</p>
    <p>This bloom­ing in­ter­est in gardening and grow­ing edible plants is a good sign, as Sin­ga­pore works to­wards its “30 by 30” goal – pro­duc­ing 30 per cent of the na­tion’s nu­tri­tional needs lo­cally by 2030.</p>
    <p>How­ever, steps to en­sure that Sin­ga­pore­ans are re­spon­si­ble gar­den­ers may be nec­es­sary. Other­wise, it is pos­si­ble that th­ese spa­ces may open a Pan­dora’s box of com­pli­ca­tions for the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>I raise three con­cerns and sug­ges­tions to mit­i­gate them.</p>
    <p>First, there is the pos­si­ble in­crease in mos­quito breed­ing sites in the al­lot­ment gar­dens.</p>
    <p>There have been a stag­ger­ing 31,338 dengue cases re­ported in the first 41 weeks of this year, sur­pass­ing the pre­vi­ous high of 22,170 re­ported for the whole of 2013 (Dengue death toll in 2020 hits record high of 28, Oct 15).</p>
    <p>Com­pared with com­mu­nity gar­dens near flats, th­ese al­lot­ment gar­dens are not as eas­ily ac­ces­si­ble, mak­ing it harder for own­ers to check reg­u­larly for mos­quito breed­ing in their plots. I pro­pose that rou­tine checks and mos­quito ex­ter­mi­na­tion pro­cesses be car­ried out in th­ese ar­eas, cur­tail­ing pos­si­ble out­breaks.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, the use of harm­ful chem­i­cal pes­ti­cides and fer­tilis­ers needs to be con­trolled, as the chem­i­cals may kill vi­tal in­sects such as bees.</p>
    <p>The chem­i­cals may also spread to other plots and cause other gar­den­ers or vis­i­tors to have ad­verse re­ac­tions. Hence, more ed­u­ca­tion and en­cour­age­ment to use nat­u­ral meth­ods in plant cul­ti­va­tion are needed. For a start, I sug­gest in­stalling com­post­ing bins in th­ese al­lot­ment gar­dens and hav­ing work­shops to in­tro­duce gar­den­ers to such meth­ods.</p>
    <p>Third, plots are leased on a three-year ba­sis, which means new gar­den­ers will have to make a long-term com­mit­ment. Tend­ing to a plot for three years may be too big a re­spon­si­bil­ity for new gar­den­ers. It could be just a bud­ding hobby for them and they may strug­gle to keep it up.</p>
    <p>NParks could per­haps of­fer group ap­pli­ca­tions, or start a gardening buddy sys­tem, pair­ing up new and vet­eran gar­den­ers to help share the bur­den and sus­tain the in­ter­est.</p>
