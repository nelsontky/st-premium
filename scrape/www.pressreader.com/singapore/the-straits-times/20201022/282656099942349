    <p>The coron­avirus pan­demic has af­fected the liveli­hoods of many peo­ple, in­clud­ing those of celebritie­s.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong singer Ea­son Chan dis­closed dur­ing an in­ter­view with the me­dia that he has stopped work for nearly a year, film­ing only one ad­ver­tise­ment dur­ing this pe­riod.</p>
    <p>He was orig­i­nally sched­uled to hold 25 con­certs at the Hong Kong Coli­seum last De­cem­ber and in Jan­uary, but these were post­poned due to the protests in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>He joked with the me­dia that he has not seen any growth in his bank ac­count for a long time, even though he has some sav­ings.</p>
    <p>Chan, 46, did per­form this year, for the One World: To­gether At Home vir­tual con­cert in April, which cel­e­brated health­care and front-line work­ers around the world and sup­ported the United Na­tions Foun­da­tion’s Covid-19 Sol­i­dar­ity Re­sponse Fund.</p>
    <p>He also held an on­line char­ity show in July in sup­port of the Hong Kong Live Per­for­mance and Pro­duc­tion In­dus­try As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Due to the pan­demic, he has been able to spend more time with his fam­ily and dog. He is mar­ried to for­mer ac­tress Hi­lary Tsui, also 46, and the cou­ple have a 16-year-old daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>Chan said he man­aged to lose some weight, as he has been work­ing out and play­ing ten­nis with his friends such as singers Ed­mond Le­ung and Eric Kwok.</p>
    <p>“I hope to ex­er­cise.... so that my body can still func­tion like a 40-year-old when I am 60,” said the singer, whose hits in­clude Ten Years and King Of Karaoke.</p>
    <p>In the midst of the pan­demic, Chan has launched his first song this year, A Dance For To­mor­row. The ac­com­pa­ny­ing mu­sic video will be out to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>He said that with the pan­demic last­ing nearly a year, many peo­ple have been ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a roller-coaster ride of emo­tions.</p>
    <p>“There are still wor­ries even though I have adapted to the sit­u­a­tion. Luck­ily, there is mu­sic in the world, which can make peo­ple a lit­tle hap­pier,” he said.</p>
