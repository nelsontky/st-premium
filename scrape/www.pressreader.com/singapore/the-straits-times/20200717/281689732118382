    <p>Asia’s coro­n­avirus resur­gence is send­ing chills across the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries ear­lier hailed for con­tain­ing the virus have been hit by a spate of new cases set­ting daily records, and some that had yet to bring their ini­tial out­breaks un­der con­trol are re­turn­ing to lock­down as num­bers spike.</p>
    <p>For many, hopes for a quick re­turn to some form of nor­malcy are fast fad­ing. And in its place is a grow­ing fear that newly re­opened busi­nesses may have to shut once more, and that plans to re­sume cross-bor­der travel may be put on ice.</p>
    <p>“I had hoped to be able to travel to Tai­wan, Ma­cau or mainland China again soon, but now my hopes are likely dashed,” said Hong Kong res­i­dent Wan Shan, who works in the fi­nan­cial ser­vice sec­tor in the city, which is see­ing its coro­n­avirus suc­cess story un­ravel rapidly.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong re­ported an­other new daily record of Covid-19 in­fec­tions yes­ter­day with 67 cases, all but four lo­cally trans­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>The Asian fi­nan­cial hub had re­turned to nor­mal life for sev­eral weeks af­ter mul­ti­ple days of zero new in­fec­tions, but a sud­den resur­gence of the deadly dis­ease has forced the au­thor­i­ties to rein­tro­duce strict so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules this week, shut­ting pub­lic fa­cil­i­ties and lim­it­ing large gath­er­ings again.</p>
    <p>WOR­RY­ING UPTICKS</p>
    <p>“We see that there will be this oc­ca­sional re­cur­rence of spread, and that is where re­peated clo­sures will be nec­es­sary,” said Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, re­fer­ring to the resur­gences in places like Hong Kong, Ja­pan and Aus­tralia. “This re­ally re­minds us that there is an out­break out there.”</p>
    <p>Ja­pan recorded 610 new Covid-19 in­fec­tions yes­ter­day, cross­ing the 500 thresh­old for the first time since mid-April. Tokyo re­ported a daily high of 286 new cases.</p>
    <p>The uptick has com­pli­cated a multi­bil­lion-dol­lar plan to boost do­mes­tic tourism, with the gov­ern­ment tweak­ing the cam­paign to ex­clude Tokyo res­i­dents and trips to and from the cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion is sim­i­lar in Aus­tralia, which brought its sec­ond­most pop­u­lous state of Vic­to­ria back un­der lock­down last week af­ter sev­eral new clus­ters emerged. Vic­to­ria also marked a daily record of 317 new cases yes­ter­day. Many Aus­tralian states have rein­tro­duced in­ter­nal bor­der clo­sures.</p>
    <p>“What will be cru­cial (to coun­tries re­sum­ing travel) is whether those that have cho­sen to re­open their tourism sec­tor can do so safely,” said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Wal­ter Th­e­seira, an econ­o­mist from the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences, adding that Thai­land, In­done­sia’s Bali Is­land, Spain and Greece will be closely watched.</p>
    <p>“It is go­ing to be a bell­wether for how quickly we can do it.”</p>
    <p>The prospects do not seem promis­ing, es­pe­cially as the pan­demic is still rag­ing else­where in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>NEW VIRUS EPI­CEN­TRE?</p>
    <p>The Red Cross has warned that South Asia is on track to be­com­ing the world’s next virus epi­cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“While the world’s at­ten­tion has been fo­cused on the un­fold­ing cri­sis in the United States and South America, a con­cur­rent hu­man tragedy is fast emerg­ing in South Asia,” the or­gan­i­sa­tion said in an Agence France-Presse re­port yes­ter­day. “Covid-19 is spread­ing at an alarm­ing rate in South Asia, home to a quar­ter of hu­man­ity.”</p>
    <p>In­dia, Pak­istan and Bangladesh have to­gether recorded more than 1.4 mil­lion in­fec­tions and nearly 33,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>In­dia – Asia’s worst-hit na­tion with a caseload set to hit one mil­lion by the end of the week – has sent hun­dreds of mil­lions of peo­ple back into a sweep­ing lock­down. It shut down the states of Patna, Bi­har and Goa yes­ter­day. IT hub Ban­ga­lore also came un­der lock­down this week.</p>
    <p>In one par­tic­u­larly telling ex­am­ple of how the out­breaks are alarm­ing gov­ern­ments, Kar­nataka Health Min­is­ter B. Sri­ra­mulu was re­ported ut­ter­ing “only God can save us” on Wed­nes­day as he sur­veyed the bur­geon­ing num­ber of in­fec­tions in his state.</p>
    <p>In the Philip­pines, in­fec­tions have more than tripled to over 61,000 since June. The au­thor­i­ties could put Metropoli­tan Manila’s 12 mil­lion peo­ple back un­der lock­down by the end of the month.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia, with over 81,000 Covid-19 cases, has also seen daily in­fec­tions in its cap­i­tal Jakarta hit new records over the past week. Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo is plan­ning a new law to fine vi­o­la­tors of so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
    <p>TRAVEL RISKS</p>
    <p>Even in Thai­land, which has gone more than 50 days with­out a lo­cal case, two new im­ported in­fec­tions with ex­po­sure to hun­dreds of peo­ple have led the gov­ern­ment this week to halt quar­an­tine ex­emp­tions given to some for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>Such lapses in in­ter­na­tional travel pro­cesses may serve as a warn­ing to coun­tries con­sid­er­ing re­open­ing their bor­ders.</p>
    <p>But elim­i­nat­ing travel al­to­gether is not a good op­tion, ac­cord­ing to NUS’ Prof Teo.</p>
    <p>One bet­ter way to mit­i­gate the risks would be to find out how best to iden­tify trav­ellers who are more likely to en­ter the coun­try in­fected, such as through pre-travel test­ing and ex­tra tests on ar­rival, he said.</p>
    <p>“It is a del­i­cate bal­anc­ing act,” said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Alex Cook, vice-dean of re­search at the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health. “Glob­ally, we are all try­ing to get to the sweet spot where nei­ther the econ­omy nor our health is too badly af­fected.”</p>
