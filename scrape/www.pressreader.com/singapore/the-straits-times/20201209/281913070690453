    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON Mr Joe Bi­den will be one for­mal step closer to the US pres­i­dency after yes­ter­day’s dead­line for states to cer­tify their slates of elec­tors to the elec­toral col­lege – lock­ing in the names of the peo­ple who will for­mally vote to make Mr Bi­den the pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Once that hap­pens, there is lit­tle turn­ing back. Congress must by law ac­cept those elec­tors if there is no out­stand­ing lit­i­ga­tion, and Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s le­gal chal­lenges have even less hope of chang­ing the out­come.</p>
    <p>Elec­tors meet in each state next Mon­day to of­fi­cially cast their votes. All of the bat­tle­ground states where Mr Trump tried to con­test the re­sults have cer­ti­fied their pres­i­den­tial elec­tion tal­lies and ap­pointed their elec­tors for Mr Bi­den, and he has more than the 270 elec­toral col­lege votes needed.</p>
    <p>Only Colorado and Hawaii are left to cer­tify their re­sults among the states Mr Bi­den won, but even they can­not change the out­come.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral law says that if a state ap­points its elec­tors and all lit­i­ga­tion is re­solved by Dec 8 – the so­called safe har­bour dead­line – Congress must con­sider them “con­clu­sive” when it meets in a joint ses­sion on Jan 6 to tally the votes.</p>
    <p>Nor­mally, the dead­line passes with­out much no­tice. But this year, Mr Trump has re­fused to con­cede de­spite Mr Bi­den’s clear vic­tory with 306 elec­toral col­lege votes.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump and his al­lies have claimed, with­out ev­i­dence, that the elec­tion was “rigged” and that he ac­tu­ally won. There is still pend­ing lit­i­ga­tion in Wis­con­sin and some other states, but the Bi­den elec­tors are valid even if the law­suits are not re­solved un­til after the safe har­bour dead­line, said Pro­fes­sor Ed­ward Fo­ley, the direc­tor of an elec­tion-law pro­gramme at Ohio State Univer­sity who has stud­ied dis­puted elec­tions.</p>
    <p>As long as there is only one sub­mis­sion of elec­toral votes from a state, Congress must ac­cept it un­less it is re­jected by both cham­bers – which is not go­ing to hap­pen, Prof Fo­ley said.</p>
    <p>Congress can still ac­cept a sub­mis­sion that lacks safe har­bour sta­tus, he said. “They won’t jeop­ar­dise Bi­den’s inau­gu­ra­tion, and they’re not go­ing to jeop­ar­dise the abil­ity of the elec­tors to meet and cast their votes,” Prof Fo­ley said of the out­stand­ing suits.</p>
    <p>Law­suits filed by the Trump cam­paign, led by his lawyers Rudy Gi­u­liani and Jenna El­lis, plus cases brought by Repub­li­can groups, have largely been re­jected for a lack of ev­i­dence. They in­clude chal­lenges to the re­sults in Ari­zona and Ne­vada.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s cam­paign and his al­lies are 1-49 in post-elec­tion lit­i­ga­tion, ac­cord­ing to a count from Demo­cratic lawyer Marc Elias, and many le­gal ex­perts do not ex­pect lit­i­ga­tion will over­turn re­sults – es­pe­cially now that they have been cer­ti­fied in the con­tested bat­tle­ground states.</p>
    <p>Even so, sev­eral elec­tion law­suits are out­stand­ing and con­tinue to be filed. In Wis­con­sin, Mr Trump’s cam­paign re-filed a com­plaint in the state court on Mon­day over vote tal­lies in two heav­ily Demo­cratic coun­ties – days after the state’s Supreme Court re­jected the pres­i­dent’s at­tempt to take his chal­lenge over mail-in bal­lots di­rectly to that court.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­can-led chal­lenges in Penn­syl­va­nia state court are fur­ther along, but have failed to gain trac­tion. And two fed­eral law­suits seek­ing to de-cer­tify Mr Bi­den’s wins in Michi­gan and Ge­or­gia, filed by for­mer Trump cam­paign lawyer Sid­ney Pow­ell, fiz­zled out on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>There could still be ob­jec­tions to Mr Bi­den’s elec­tors when Congress meets on Jan 6 to count each state’s elec­toral votes, and Repub­li­can Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Mo Brooks of Alabama has said he in­tends to make one.</p>
    <p>Yet any such chal­lenge must be made by both a House and a Se­nate mem­ber. Even if that hap­pens, each cham­ber would then meet to re­solve the ob­jec­tion and it would al­most cer­tainly fail, said Pro­fes­sor Alexan­der Keyssar of the Har­vard Kennedy School who has stud­ied the Elec­toral Col­lege.</p>
    <p>“We’re go­ing to see some lit­tle ac­tion here, but I think it’s go­ing to be i ncon­se­quen­tial,” Prof Keyssar said.</p>
    <p>All of the bat­tle­ground states where Mr Trump tried to con­test the re­sults have cer­ti­fied their pres­i­den­tial elec­tion tal­lies and ap­pointed their elec­tors for Mr Bi­den, and he has more than the 270 elec­toral col­lege votes needed.</p>
