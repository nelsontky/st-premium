    <p>2008 BRI­TISH GP, SIL­VER­STONE</p>
    <p>In his sec­ond sea­son in For­mula One, McLaren driver Lewis Hamil­ton put on ar­guably still his most dom­i­nant race in the sport with a vir­tu­oso dis­play in the rain.</p>
    <p>He lapped ev­ery­one up to Fer­rari’s Kimi Raikko­nen in fourth spot and af­ter fin­ish­ing 1min 08.6sec ahead of BMW Sauber’s Nick Hei­d­feld in sec­ond, he then said it was “by far my best vic­tory”.</p>
    <p>2014 BAHRAIN GP, BAHRAIN</p>
    <p>Be­fore the race, Mercedes team­mate Nico Ros­berg was lead­ing the cham­pi­onship, had qual­i­fied on pole po­si­tion and set the fastest lap, but the Ger­man left here sec­ond best to Hamil­ton.</p>
    <p>Af­ter win­ning the head-to­head fight, the Bri­ton, who would be­come world cham­pion for a sec­ond time that sea­son, said it was “one of the best cal­cu­lated races I’ve ever had”, and the vic­tory helped set the tone for fu­ture bat­tles down the road.</p>
    <p>This re­mains Hamil­ton’s only win when start­ing out­side of the top 10. The Bri­ton started in 14th place due to hy­draulic prob­lems in qual­i­fy­ing.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he sensed the “pos­si­bil­ity to win when it started to rain”. The Bri­ton, long known for his mas­tery in wet weather, made up ground un­til Lap 52, when he cap­i­talised on leader Sebastian Vet­tel crash­ing out and went on to claim a “mir­a­cle” win.</p>
    <p>2018 ITAL­IAN GP, MONZA</p>
    <p>Fer­rari had been faster than Mercedes all week­end at their home cir­cuit, with Finn Raikko­nen on pole and the home fans turned out in droves, ex­pect­ing a one-two fin­ish along­side ti­tle con­tender Vet­tel.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Ti­fosi did not count on the Ger­man spin­ning out at the start, en­abling Hamil­ton to stay on the heels of Raikko­nen be­fore pass­ing him with eight laps left and tak­ing the che­quered flag with an 8.7sec mar­gin – a win he hailed as “right up there”.</p>
