    <p>•</p>
    <p>LON­DON The new coro­n­avirus vari­ant that emerged in Bri­tain is more trans­mis­si­ble and ap­pears to af­fect a higher pro­por­tion of peo­ple aged un­der 20, said a re­port from Im­pe­rial Col­lege Lon­don and other science groups.</p>
    <p>The mu­ta­tion of con­cern has “a sub­stan­tial trans­mis­sion ad­van­tage” and is linked to “epi­demic growth in nearly all ar­eas”, the sci­en­tists wrote. It can raise the virus’ re­pro­duc­tion rate, which in­di­cates how many peo­ple one pa­tient in­fects, by as much as 0.7.</p>
    <p>“This will make con­trol more dif­fi­cult and fur­ther ac­cen­tu­ates the ur­gency of rolling out vac­ci­na­tion as quickly as pos­si­ble,” said Pro­fes­sor Neil Fer­gu­son from Im­pe­rial Col­lege Lon­don who has worked on mod­el­ling the out­break.</p>
    <p>So­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures that worked against ear­lier strains of the virus were in­suf­fi­cient to con­trol the spread of the new vari­ant, the study found. The govern­ment had pre­vi­ously said the new strain was as much as 70 per cent more trans­mis­si­ble than other ver­sions, with­out pro­vid­ing doc­u­men­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers used sta­tis­ti­cal tools to eval­u­ate the link be­tween trans­mis­sion and fre­quency of the new vari­ant across Bri­tain. The data has i nformed the govern­ment’s pan­demic plan­ning in re­cent weeks, Prof Fer­gu­son said.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers, how­ever, noted that it is pos­si­ble that the new vari­ant ap­pears to in­fect the young the most be­cause the re­search was done when there were lock­downs but schools re­mained opened.</p>
    <p>In the past week, the Bri­tish vari­ant has been dis­cov­ered in sev­eral places.</p>
    <p>China re­ported its first im­ported case of the Bri­tish vari­ant in a 23-year-old stu­dent who had re­turned from Bri­tain. She was tested in Shang­hai on Dec 14.</p>
    <p>In Tai­wan, the au­thor­i­ties have de­tected a se­cond case of the vari­ant found in Bri­tain. The pa­tient, a Tai­wan res­i­dent in his 20s, re­turned from Bri­tain on Dec 22 and had a fever and mus­cle ache four days later. He tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The first such case in Tai­wan had also been in Bri­tain for study. The pa­tient re­turned to Tai­wan on Sun­day. Both cases were iden­ti­fied af­ter the epi­demic con­trol agency an­a­lysed sam­ples of the Covid-19 virus from 21 pa­tients who trav­elled from Europe and the United States and had a high level of virus.</p>
    <p>In the US, the Bri­tish vari­ant has been re­ported in Florida, state health of­fi­cials said on Thurs­day, mak­ing it the third known US state to iden­tify such a case.</p>
    <p>The Florida case in­volved a man in his 20s with no his­tory of travel. Two other cases in­volv­ing the Bri­tish vari­ant have been iden­ti­fied in Colorado and Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>The Florida Depart­ment of Health said: “The depart­ment is work­ing with the CDC (US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion) on this in­ves­ti­ga­tion.”</p>
    <p>The cases in Colorado and Cal­i­for­nia, found in in­di­vid­u­als who had not trav­elled re­cently, showed the likely com­mu­nity spread of the vari­ant from per­son to per­son in the US.</p>
    <p>Health ex­perts have said they be­lieve the new vari­ant is more in­fec­tious but that re­cently ap­proved vac­cines should pro­vide pro­tec­tion against it.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish vari­ant has also been re­ported in the Brazil­ian city of</p>
    <p>Sao Paulo, lead­ing the au­thor­i­ties on Thurs­day to call for stepped-up mea­sures to curb the spread.</p>
    <p>The two cases there were de­tected by pri­vate di­ag­nos­tic lab­o­ra­tory Dasa, which in­formed the state’s Adolfo Lutz In­sti­tute and the Sec­re­tariat of Health Mon­i­tor­ing for fur­ther anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>Known as B117, the vari­ant from Bri­tain has been de­tected in 17 places other than Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, France has re­ported its first case of the South African vari­ant, the Health Min­istry said on Thurs­day. Believed to be more eas­ily trans­mit­ted, the vari­ant was found in a man who had re­turned from South Africa.</p>
    <p>The 501.V2 vari­ant was de­tected by the South African au­thor­i­ties in the mid­dle of last month. Cases have since been found in Ja­pan and Bri­tain, among oth­ers.</p>
