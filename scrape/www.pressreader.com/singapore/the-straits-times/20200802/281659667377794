    <p>Tak­ing the op­por­tu­nity of­fered by Nurses’ Day yes­ter­day, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat thanked nurses in Sin­ga­pore for their ser­vice, es­pe­cially amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng took to his Face­book page to post a video mes­sage he recorded for the vir­tual Nurses’ Day cel­e­bra­tion at Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal (TTSH) and the Na­tional Centre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases.</p>
    <p>“This spe­cial day has taken on added sig­nif­i­cance this year, as our nurses are play­ing a crit­i­cal role in our bat­tle against the virus,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Since we had our first con­firmed case six months ago, all of you have been work­ing tire­lessly on the front line in the fight against Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>He said they have had to make sig­nif­i­cant ad­just­ments to their work pro­cesses and rou­tines.</p>
    <p>And when clus­ters emerged at mi­grant worker dor­mi­to­ries, a num­ber of nurses also vol­un­teered for swab op­er­a­tions and to take care of those who tested pos­i­tive, he added.</p>
    <p>“To­gether with oth­ers on the front line, you held your posts, and even going be­yond the call of duty, to keep the com­mu­nity and your pa­tients safe,” said Mr Heng. “The sit­u­a­tion in our dorms is un­der con­trol, and we are on track to clear all the dorms by early Au­gust.</p>
    <p>“Look­ing back, you have helped to make a seem­ingly im­pos­si­ble sit­u­a­tion pos­si­ble,” he added.</p>
    <p>In his video, Mr Heng said that many nurses made personal sac­ri­fices and worked as a team to man­age the high work­load and adapt as the coron­avirus sit­u­a­tion evolved.</p>
    <p>“As you stood in unity with one another, I am glad many Sin­ga­pore­ans also stood in sol­i­dar­ity with you, through the many ex­pres­sions of support and acts of gen­eros­ity. But these ges­tures can­not fully de­scribe our grat­i­tude and ap­pre­ci­a­tion of your con­tri­bu­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>Look­ing ahead, he wished nurses well as Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to han­dle the un­cer­tainty of the pan­demic. “As you face the chal­lenges ahead, I hope that you will con­tinue to hold on to that sense of pur­pose that first drew you to nurs­ing. I am con­fi­dent that with your full com­mit­ment, we can make any­thing pos­si­ble,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng, 59, also shared how he and his fam­ily ex­pe­ri­enced first­hand the warmth and care of nurses when he was hos­pi­talised at TTSH for six weeks in 2016. “Your en­cour­age­ment and support was a big fac­tor in my re­cov­ery,” he said.</p>
    <p>On May 12, 2016, Mr Heng col­lapsed at a weekly Cab­i­net meet­ing after suf­fer­ing a stroke. Three doc­tors in Cab­i­net at­tended to him before he was taken to TTSH.</p>
    <p>The stroke was caused by an aneurysm, which is a lo­calised weak­en­ing of a blood ves­sel. He un­der­went ini­tial neu­ro­surgery to re­lieve pres­sure in his brain due to the bleed­ing. The aneurysm was suc­cess­fully closed.</p>
    <p>“Nurs­ing is more than a job. It is a call­ing with a deep pur­pose. I’m glad that you have an­swered the call of duty,” said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>IM­MENSE GRAT­I­TUDE</p>
    <p>As you stood in unity with one another, I am glad many Sin­ga­pore­ans also stood in sol­i­dar­ity with you, through the many ex­pres­sions of support and acts of gen­eros­ity. But these ges­tures can­not fully de­scribe our grat­i­tude and ap­pre­ci­a­tion of your ’’ con­tri­bu­tions.</p>
