    <p>Covid-19 in­fec­tions con­tinue to sur­face i n dor­mi­to­ries pre­vi­ously cleared of the virus, as many of the work­ers there have not been ex­posed and there­fore re­main sus­cep­ti­ble to the virus, said Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Man­power Tan See Leng.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, we are pre­pared for this,” he told a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Since the dor­mi­to­ries were de­clared cleared nearly a month ago on Aug 11, there has been an av­er­age of 45 work­ers test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19 daily, the Min­istry of Health said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>These were de­tected pri­mar­ily through ac­tive sur­veil­lance test­ing, such as ros­tered rou­tine test­ing (RRT), and ag­gres­sive trac­ing and test­ing when a new case is de­tected. About 2 per cent of these newly de­tected cases had pos­i­tive sero­log­i­cal tests, in­di­cat­ing past in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>When asked if some of the cases in the cleared dor­mi­to­ries had slipped through un­de­tected by the poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) tests, Dr Tan pointed out: “A PCR test is a test at that par­tic­u­lar point in time. So it’s a snap­shot of the sta­tus of the mi­grant worker at that par­tic­u­lar point in time. And it’s also a func­tion of pick­ing up the virus at a cer­tain con­cen­tra­tion.”</p>
    <p>He said it is not a mat­ter of the sen­si­tiv­ity, adding that the test kits used here are “very sen­si­tive tests”.</p>
    <p>“It’s just that at that par­tic­u­lar point in time, in the cy­cle of the in­cu­ba­tion, we may not have picked up the virus be­cause the man­i­fes­ta­tion of it, the con­cen­tra­tion has still not reached that level yet.”</p>
    <p>Be­cause of this, the au­thor­i­ties de­cided to tighten the drag­net by ros­ter­ing work­ers for test­ing every 14 days, a key lever in Sin­ga­pore’s de­tec­tion strat­egy, said Dr Tan, who cited stud­ies show­ing that up to 30 per cent of in­fected in­di­vid­u­als are asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>In 14 days, about 98 per cent of the mi­grant worker dor­mi­tory pop­u­la­tion can be tested, he noted.</p>
    <p>“Now, does it mean we miss out the 2 per cent? No, be­cause the mo­ment we pick up a re-emer­gent sort of a num­ber, we ac­tu­ally lock down the block and we test ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>“So we be­lieve that this re­peated test­ing... will al­low us to weed out this thing and bring it un­der con­trol.”</p>
    <p>Only about 15 per cent of dor­mi­tory res­i­dents be­gan rou­tine test­ing early last month, but a few weeks later, as more work­ers went on the ros­ter, an in­crease in new cases was noted.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, about 90 per cent of work­ers have been sched­uled for the rou­tine test­ing and “we ex­pect to reach 100 per cent over the next few weeks”, said Dr Tan.</p>
    <p>“Early de­tec­tion is crit­i­cal as it helps to break the chain of trans­mis­sion and re­duce the num­ber of in­fec­tions sub­se­quently. We will con­tinue our ef­forts to de­tect new cases early, and iso­late them.”</p>
    <p>Work­ers who have not yet reg­is­tered for RRT can­not go out to work, he said. “So that is how we ac­tu­ally ‘con­tain and quar­an­tine’ this group.”</p>
    <p>Adding that the rou­tine test­ing is an ef­fec­tive and ef­fi­cient mea­sure, Dr Tan called on dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tors, em­ploy­ers and work­ers to work to­gether with the au­thor­i­ties to min­imise the risk of an out­break.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan noted that the au­thor­i­ties have suc­cess­fully con­tained more than 200 re-emer­gent dor­mi­tory sites so far. In the ma­jor­ity of these sites, the num­ber of re-emer­gent in­fec­tions has been low, with fewer than 10 each.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong, who co-chairs the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling the Covid-19 pan­demic, stressed that there is a risk of trans­mis­sion in the com­mu­nity, as these dor­mi­tory res­i­dents may in­ter­act with fel­low mi­grant work­ers and Sin­ga­pore­ans at their work sites.</p>
    <p>“So there is a risk,” he added. “What is cru­cial re­ally is to en­sure that in ad­di­tion to the mea­sures that we have im­posed in the dor­mi­to­ries and the work sites, we need to con­tinue to be quite tight in the safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures in the com­mu­nity. So that even if there’s an in­fec­tion in the com­mu­nity, we can re­duce the risk of spread and re­duce the risk of a large com­mu­nity clus­ter from form­ing.”</p>
    <p>NEED FOR COM­MU­NITY MEA­SURES</p>
    <p>So there is a risk... What is cru­cial re­ally is to en­sure that in ad­di­tion to the mea­sures that we have im­posed in the dor­mi­to­ries and the work sites, we need to con­tinue to be quite tight in the safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures in the com­mu­nity.

    <p>HEALTH MIN­IS­TER GAN KIM YONG, say­ing there is a risk of trans­mis­sion in the com­mu­nity, as dor­mi­tory res­i­dents may in­ter­act with fel­low mi­grant work­ers and Sin­ga­pore­ans at their work sites.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Fences have been erected to sep&#xAD;a&#xAD;rate the var&#xAD;i&#xAD;ous blocks at a for&#xAD;eign worker dor&#xAD;mi&#xAD;tory, and gates have also been in&#xAD;stalled to en&#xAD;sure that the res&#xAD;i&#xAD;dents use ded&#xAD;i&#xAD;cated sets of stairs to com&#xAD;mon ar&#xAD;eas and en&#xAD;trances. These are among the mea&#xAD;sures that the un&#xAD;named dor&#xAD;mi&#xAD;tory here has put in place to limit min&#xAD;gling among groups of work&#xAD;ers stay&#xAD;ing there, the Covid-19 task force said yes&#xAD;ter&#xAD;day, when it urged the sec&#xAD;tor to work with the au&#xAD;thor ities in min&#xAD;imis&#xAD;ing the chances of an out&#xAD;break. Other mea&#xAD;sures taken by the dor&#xAD;mi&#xAD;tory in&#xAD;clude us&#xAD;ing floor mark&#xAD;ings to set out des&#xAD;ig&#xAD;nated routes within the premises and hav&#xAD;ing se&#xAD;cu&#xAD;rity of&#xAD;fi&#xAD;cers on duty round the clock to en&#xAD;force safe dis&#xAD;tanc&#xAD;ing mea&#xAD;sures. Com&#xAD;mu&#xAD;nal fa&#xAD;cil&#xAD;i&#xAD;ties such as the cook&#xAD;ing area and can&#xAD;teen have also been fenced up to split them into ar&#xAD;eas for work&#xAD;ers stay&#xAD;ing in dif&#xAD;fer&#xAD;ent sec&#xAD;tions of the dorm.</p>
