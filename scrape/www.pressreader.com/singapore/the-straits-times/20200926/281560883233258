    <p>It has taken just nine months for Covid-19 to claim a mil­lion lives, a mile­stone it may cross to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Given that 95 per cent of th­ese ca­su­al­ties oc­curred over the past six months, will the next mil­lion deaths come even sooner? Or will the world find a so­lu­tion to stem the pan­demic?</p>
    <p>No one has the an­swer, but those one mil­lion deaths pro­vide some valu­able point­ers.</p>
    <p>More than 200,000 of them were in the United States which, with 4 per cent of the world’s pop­u­la­tion, ac­counts for over 20 per cent of Covid-19 deaths.</p>
    <p>Just four coun­tries – the US, Brazil, In­dia and Mex­ico – ac­count for more than half of the Covid-19 deaths glob­ally. The other 480,000 deaths are spread over about 190 other coun­tries and ter­ri­to­ries.</p>
    <p>The ma­jor fac­tors that con­trib­ute to Covid-19 deaths are:</p>
    <p>Age: Older peo­ple who are in­fected have a higher risk of dy­ing. A com­par­i­son done by the US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion (CDC), us­ing 18 to 29 years as the base group found that tod­dlers four years and younger are nine times less likely to die, while deaths are 630 times more likely in se­niors aged 85 years and older.</p>
    <p>Un­der­ly­ing med­i­cal con­di­tions:</p>
    <p>The CDC said re­gard­less of age, cer­tain med­i­cal con­di­tions also put peo­ple at higher risk of death. They in­clude can­cer, chronic kid­ney dis­ease and heart con­di­tions. Trans­plant re­cip­i­ents are also more sus­cep­ti­ble as they have weak­ened im­mune sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Over­whelmed health­care sys­tems:</p>
    <p>More peo­ple die when health­care sys­tems are stretched be­yond ca­pac­ity, as some pa­tients are not able to get the care they need to over­come the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tion num­bers: This may be ob­vi­ous, but it bears re­peat­ing. Only those who get in­fected by the coro­n­avirus are at risk of dy­ing from it.</p>
    <p>How coun­tries have per­formed in their bat­tle against the virus has de­pended largely on how they have man­aged th­ese four fac­tors.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries that have been suc­cess­ful in keep­ing in­fec­tion num­bers low have also seen fewer deaths. They in­clude:</p>
    <p>• New Zealand (25 deaths out of 1,827 in­fected in a pop­u­la­tion of five mil­lion)</p>
    <p>• Viet­nam (35 deaths out of 1,069 in­fected in a pop­u­la­tion of 97.5 mil­lion) and</p>
    <p>• Thai­land (59 deaths out of 3,516 in­fected in a pop­u­la­tion of 70 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>Coun­tries where health­care sys­tems were over­whelmed for some time also recorded higher mor­tal­ity num­bers. Th­ese in­clude sev­eral Euro­pean coun­tries like:</p>
    <p>• Bri­tain (41,902 deaths out of 416,363 in­fected in a pop­u­la­tion of 68 mil­lion)</p>
    <p>• Italy (35,781 deaths out of 304,323 in­fected in a pop­u­la­tion of 60 mil­lion) and</p>
    <p>• France (31,511 deaths out of 497,237 in­fected in a pop­u­la­tion of 65 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>In April, there were re­ports from th­ese coun­tries of pa­tients be­ing turned away for lack of beds, doc­tors cry­ing as they could not pro­vide in­ten­sive care to pa­tients who needed it, and over­worked health­care pro­fes­sion­als clock­ing very long hours.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tions among the sick and el­derly are one rea­son for the high num­ber of deaths in the US. Re­ports by US me­dia say care fa­cil­ity deaths ac­count for at least a quar­ter, and per­haps as much as a third, of Covid-19 deaths in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The virus has spread glob­ally with prac­ti­cally no coun­try spared. So why have some suc­ceeded and oth­ers failed so mis­er­ably in deal­ing with this virus?</p>
    <p>Of­ten with a novel virus, the coun­tries that are first to face it fare the worst, since it would have caught them by sur­prise. Also, lit­tle is known of the new bug. But not with this pan­demic.</p>
    <p>China, where this new virus emerged, has done rel­a­tively well with 4,745 deaths out of 90,934 in­fected in a pop­u­la­tion of 1.4 bil­lion. In fact, as the epi­cen­tre moved from Asia to Europe and then to the Amer­i­cas, the prob­lem seemed to get worse.</p>
    <p>Dr Michael Ryan, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s (WHO) Health Emer­gen­cies Pro­gramme, gave some pos­si­ble an­swers dur­ing the NUS Medicine’s Covid-19 we­bi­nar on Sept 10.</p>
    <p>He sug­gested that the dis­parate per­for­mances of dif­fer­ent coun­tries stemmed from in­suf­fi­cient prepa­ra­tion, lack of mus­cle mem­ory and vary­ing lev­els of so­cial co­he­sion.</p>
    <p>NOT PRE­PARED</p>
    <p>Dr Ryan, who has been at the fore­front of man­ag­ing acute risks to global health for nearly 25 years, said the world has learnt a lot from past health emer­gen­cies, “but we haven’t im­ple­mented a lot of those learn­ings”.</p>
    <p>He said glob­ally, there has been “se­ri­ous un­der-in­vest­ment in man­ag­ing and mit­i­gat­ing” the risks from new in­fec­tious dis­eases.</p>
    <p>It is not that coun­tries have not in­vested in health­care. But the in­vest­ments tend to be in bricks-and-mor­tar in­fras­truc­ture – more hos­pi­tals and beds, and more lab­o­ra­tory fa­cil­i­ties. He said this is “very static pre­pared­ness”, adding that “the true essence is the way data is col­lected and de­ci­sions are made”. It was this lack of pre­pared­ness in Europe that re­sulted in the surge in cases and hos­pi­tals be­ing over­whelmed.</p>
    <p>“Much of the fail­ure on the global level is the fail­ure to pre­pare, not in fail­ure to per­form,” said Dr Ryan. “I hon­estly think ev­ery­one had tried to do their best. Un­for­tu­nately our best is some­times not enough.”</p>
    <p>Cit­ing the ex­am­ple of run­ning a marathon, he said: “No mat­ter what my will is, no mat­ter what my in­tent, I will not fin­ish that marathon be­cause I have not pre­pared. Good will and best in­ten­tions aside, per­for­mance is al­ways de­pen­dent on your prepa­ra­tion.”</p>
    <p>MUS­CLE MEM­ORY</p>
    <p>Only coun­tries that have been through a health emer­gency – such as Sars (se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome) for Sin­ga­pore which killed 33 peo­ple out of 238 in­fected in 2003 and caused the clo­sure of Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal, one of the busiest hos­pi­tals here – would have mus­cle mem­ory in­grained in their psy­che. Such coun­tries would be quick to col­lect, an­a­lyse and act on data. They also pos­sess the ca­pac­ity to make de­ci­sions, to cre­ate new sci­ence and turn that into pol­icy and ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Ryan said “Asian coun­tries have a much higher sense of alert for this kind of virus. (It) trig­gers a col­lec­tive com­mu­nity dis­quiet”.</p>
    <p>In the first week of Jan­uary, when the world heard of the pos­si­bil­ity of a novel virus, the num­ber of phone calls he re­ceived from Asian coun­tries like Sin­ga­pore, South Korea and Ja­pan had “gone through the roof”. Th­ese coun­tries had an im­me­di­ate level of con­cern.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, for ex­am­ple, had set up the multi-min­istry task force be­fore a single pa­tient here had been di­ag­nosed with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>For the rest of the world, Dr Ryan said, “it’s a re­mote con­cept”, re­sult­ing in them be­ing “caught off guard” when the virus hit them.</p>
    <p>SO­CIAL CO­HE­SION</p>
    <p>Coun­tries that have per­formed bet­ter also tend to have stronger com­mu­nity buy-in, said Dr Ryan.</p>
    <p>He said such a health emer­gency “trig­gers a col­lec­tive com­mu­nity dis­quiet and gov­ern­ments are ex­pected to be ready to han­dle it”. Peo­ple see gov­ern­ment in­ter­ven­tion as re­spon­si­ble ac­tion.</p>
    <p>But in some coun­tries, that is seen as in­ter­fer­ence in the lives of in­di­vid­u­als and an in­va­sion of per­sonal pri­vacy. It boils down to dif­fer­ences in so­cial con­tract that peo­ple have with their gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>He said coun­tries where peo­ple see them­selves as part of a com­mu­nity tend to ab­sorb in­for­ma­tion pos­i­tively and act in a more sus­tain­able man­ner.</p>
    <p>But in so­ci­eties where the in­di­vid­ual is seen as the most im­por­tant unit of so­ci­ety, as op­posed to the com­mu­nity, peo­ple do not feel that sense of re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>He said: “Their re­sponse is: What does it mean to me? What is the trans­mis­sion risk for me? Will the vac­cine work for me? Is my travel im­por­tant for me? Rather than ask the ques­tion: Is my travel be­hav­iour dan­ger­ous to some­one else? Is my at­tend­ing the event dan­ger­ous for some­one else? Is my tak­ing the vac­cine im­por­tant to so­ci­ety?”</p>
    <p>He said: “So­ci­eties with a high level of so­cial co­he­sion and sense as a group have done bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>Dr Ryan added that if one takes the view that so­cial dis­tanc­ing, avoid­ing crowds and hand hy­giene can slow the spread of the virus, “then your suc­cess is al­most 100 per cent based on so­ci­ety’s will­ing­ness to ac­cept those rules”.</p>
    <p>PO­LIT­I­CAL LEAD­ER­SHIP</p>
    <p>What does pol­i­tics have to do with the sci­ence and strat­egy of fight­ing the virus that has dis­rupted lives and liveli­hoods glob­ally?</p>
    <p>More than one would think, es­pe­cially in the US and Brazil – two of the three coun­tries worst hit by the virus. In both cases, the lead­ers were driv­ing their own agenda to keep the econ­omy open.</p>
    <p>With his re-elec­tion cam­paign on the line, US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has ig­nored the ad­vice of health au­thor­i­ties and down­played the sever­ity of the Covid-19 cri­sis. He even took the CDC, one of the fore­most health au­thor­i­ties in the world, out of the re­port­ing line.</p>
    <p>Brazil­ian Pres­i­dent Jair Bol­sonaro even re­placed his Health Min­is­ter with one will­ing to push for re­open­ing the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, cau­tioned it may be pre­ma­ture to de­ter­mine the part that pol­i­tics has played “in the ap­palling sit­u­a­tions in US and Brazil”.</p>
    <p>But he added: “When lead­ers of coun­tries choose to ig­nore the facts and the sci­ence of Covid-19, this is when poor de­ci­sions are made that am­plify the spread of the coro­n­avirus in a coun­try, rather than help to im­prove the sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>The l es­sons of the past nine months are clear. Re­ac­tions to the un­fold­ing cri­sis will have to be faster. Pol­icy will have to be driven by sci­ence rather than po­lit­i­cal agen­das.</p>
    <p>And while the search for a vac­cine con­tin­ues, pop­u­la­tion buy-in for Covid-19 mea­sures will de­ter­mine whether the virus claims an­other mil­lion lives – and if so, how quickly – or if it will be kept at bay.</p>
