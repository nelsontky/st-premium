    <p>LON­DON Face­book, Twit­ter and Tik­Tok face fines of up to 10 per cent of turnover if they fail to re­move and limit the spread of il­le­gal content un­der laws pro­posed by Bri­tain yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Tech plat­forms will also need to do more to pro­tect chil­dren from be­ing ex­posed to groom­ing, bul­ly­ing and pornog­ra­phy, the govern­ment said, to en­sure the safety of chil­dren on­line.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s Dig­i­tal Sec­re­tary Oliver Dow­den said: “We are en­ter­ing a new age of ac­count­abil­ity for tech to pro­tect chil­dren and vul­ner­a­ble users, to re­store trust in this in­dus­try and en­shrine in law safe­guards for free speech.”</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments glob­ally are wrestling over mea­sures to bet­ter con­trol il­le­gal or dan­ger­ous content on so­cial me­dia, with the Euro­pean Union set to un­veil its own pack­age yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s new rules, which will be in­tro­duced in leg­is­la­tion next year, could l ead to sites that break the rules be­ing blocked and se­nior man­agers held li­able for content.</p>
    <p>Pop­u­lar plat­forms will be re­quired to have clear poli­cies for content that, while not il­le­gal, could cause harm such as dis­sem­i­nat­ing mis­in­for­ma­tion about Covid-19 vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Mr Dow­den said the frame­work would give large dig­i­tal busi­nesses “ro­bust rules” to fol­low.</p>
    <p>Face­book and Google had said in Fe­bru­ary that they would work with the govern­ment on the reg­u­la­tions. Both com­pa­nies said they took safety ex­tremely se­ri­ously and had al­ready changed their poli­cies and op­er­a­tions to bet­ter tackle the is­sue.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish me­dia reg­u­la­tor, the Of­fice of Com­mu­ni­ca­tions, com­monly known as Of­com, will be given the power to fine com­pa­nies up to £18 mil­lion (S$32 mil­lion), or 10 per cent of global turnover, which­ever is higher, for break­ing the rules.</p>
    <p>It will also be able to block non­com­pli­ant ser­vices from be­ing ac­cessed in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>On­line jour­nal­ism and reader com­ments on news pub­lish­ers’ web­sites will be ex­empt to safe­guard free­dom of ex­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>AGE OF AC­COUNT­ABIL­ITY</p>
    <p>We are en­ter­ing a new age of ac­count­abil­ity for tech to pro­tect chil­dren and vul­ner­a­ble users, to re­store trust in this in­dus­try and en­shrine in law safe­guards for free speech.</p>
