    <p>The United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion re­sult may still be in doubt, but who­ever emerges vic­to­ri­ous will need to unite the coun­try to adapt to the chal­lenges of glob­al­i­sa­tion and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, or risk a back­lash so se­vere it could dam­age the global eco­nomic sys­tem, Sin­ga­pore’s Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing warned yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>With­out such a shift, “there will be a push­back against glob­al­i­sa­tion and the world eco­nomic sys­tem may frac­ture or frag­ment be­cause of that,” Mr Chan said in an in­ter­view with Bloomberg Tele­vi­sion’s Ms Haslinda Amin.</p>
    <p>“One of the big­gest chal­lenges for the US go­ing for­ward is how can it main­tain its lead­er­ship in the world by mo­bil­is­ing like-minded part­ners to work to­gether to up­hold and up­date the global eco­nomic and se­cu­rity or­der,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan’s com­ments came as Demo­cratic can­di­date Joe Bi­den closed in on the 270 Elec­toral Col­lege votes needed for the pres­i­dency and in­cum­bent Don­ald Trump filed le­gal chal­lenges to stop on­go­ing vote-count­ing in sev­eral states.</p>
    <p>The re­sults show the US elec­torate is “al­most split down the mid­dle”, Mr Chan said later yes­ter­day in a round ta­ble with Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>Aside from the US vote, he said Sin­ga­pore is be­ing im­pacted by the resur­gence of Covid-19 in­fec­tions over­seas, which has trig­gered suc­ces­sive lock­downs with a rip­ple ef­fect on the city’s tradere­liant econ­omy.</p>
    <p>He warned that Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic re­cov­ery would be “grad­ual and un­even”, echo­ing an as­sess­ment last week from the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore. The coun­try’s over­all un­em­ploy­ment rate climbed in the third quar­ter to its high­est level since 2004.</p>
    <p>While China’s resur­gence from the ini­tial virus out­break of­fers some sup­port to the global econ­omy, “China alone will not be able to do mir­a­cles for the world”, he said.</p>
    <p>He added that China will need to re­bal­ance its own econ­omy along­side other coun­tries and grap­ple with a host of chal­lenges, such as man­ag­ing un­even de­vel­op­ment across the coun­try, se­cur­ing sup­ply lines and fo­cus­ing on its re­silience, and man­ag­ing an age­ing and di­verse pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>In­creas­ingly, busi­nesses are ac­cept­ing that some things have changed struc­turally since the pan­demic, he said. About half of Sin­ga­pore busi­nesses Mr Chan has spo­ken with now agree there will not be a re­turn to the “pre-Covid-19 world”, ver­sus about 20 per cent three months ago, he said.</p>
    <p>“Many com­pa­nies are re­think­ing their en­tire global pro­duc­tion foot­print”, and even com­pa­nies that are do­ing well, as in the semi­con­duc­tor in­dus­try, are ad­just­ing, Mr Chan added.</p>
    <p>In the long-to-medium term, such ad­just­ments post-Covid-19 are “a net plus for Sin­ga­pore, for a coun­try with­out nat­u­ral re­sources”, he said, al­low­ing it to</p>
    <p>“tran­scend our ge­o­graph­i­cal size and ge­o­graph­i­cal lo­ca­tion”.</p>
    <p>“The ques­tion is re­ally how con­nected we are with the rest of the world,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan also ex­pects “good news” in about 10 days on the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship, the 15-na­tion trade pact that is ex­pected to be signed at an up­com­ing meet­ing of Asean lead­ers.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s first pri­or­ity is to re­open its econ­omy “safely and sus­tain­ably”, then to re-es­tab­lish con­nec­tiv­ity with other coun­tries, Mr Chan noted.</p>
