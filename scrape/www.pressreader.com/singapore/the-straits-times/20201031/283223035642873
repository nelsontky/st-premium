    <p>Slowly but surely, elec­tric ve­hi­cles (EVs) are pop­u­lat­ing Sin­ga­pore’s roads. Their pres­ence is wel­come as their ben­e­fits in­clude zero lo­cal emis­sions, low noise pol­lu­tion, lower op­er­at­ing costs and higher re­li­a­bil­ity be­cause they have sim­pler pow­er­trains.</p>
    <p>Here, we com­pare two cars which book­end the elec­tric sport util­ity ve­hi­cle (e-SUV) spec­trum – the Jaguar I-Pace (the reigning Straits Times Car of the Year) and, from the brand that is syn­ony­mous with EVs, the Tesla Model X.</p>
    <p>They are not di­rect ri­vals. Parked side by side, the huge Model X makes the I-Pace look pert. The Tesla seats up to seven pas­sen­gers and the Jaguar, five. There is also the small mat­ter of the Tesla cost­ing well more than $100,000 more.</p>
    <p>Apart from how th­ese two cars stack up against each other, it is also in­ter­est­ing to see how they in­di­vid­u­ally ad­dress their quite dis­tinct re­mits.</p>
    <p>The I-Pace we al­ready know and love. Its avant-garde l ooks and coupe-like roofline make it the coolest-look­ing cross­over around and hint at the de­li­cious driv­ing ex­pe­ri­ence it de­liv­ers.</p>
    <p>If the I-Pace is the lithe ath­lete of e-SUVs, the Model X is the burly weightlift­er. It is more than 30cm longer and 10cm wider than the IPace and at more than 2.3 tonnes, it is also heftier.</p>
    <p>And while its sheer size gives the clean, peb­ble-shaped body am­ple pres­ence, its looks are less head-turn­ing than the Jaguar’s.</p>
    <p>The Tesla’s party piece is, of course, its fa­bled rear fal­con-wing doors, which soar ma­jes­ti­cally at the touch of a but­ton. They are show-stop­ping and bril­liantly con­ceived. Be­ing dou­ble-hinged, they need less lat­eral space than con­ven­tional doors, mak­ing them per­fect for Sin­ga­pore’s nar­row carpark lots.</p>
    <p>They also open with a much wider and taller aper­ture, mak­ing en­try into the sec­ond- and thirdrow seats a dod­dle. No fear of them hit­ting a car parked along­side or a low carpark ceil­ing. There are mul­ti­ple sen­sors to de­tect ob­sta­cles, so the doors will go only as far as they are able to.</p>
    <p>Un­sur­pris­ingly, the Tesla’s cabin is vast, even ri­valling that of large MPVs (multi-pur­pose ve­hi­cles). Legroom in the back is limou­sine-like, and even the op­tional third row of seats has am­ple space for tall adults.</p>
    <p>Ma­te­ri­als and build are a step be­hind the Jaguar’s, though. When it comes to am­bi­ence, Tesla still has things to learn from the lux­ury marques.</p>
    <p>In keep­ing with the com­pany’s techy im­age, the Tesla’s cock­pit is res­o­lutely min­i­mal­ist. While the I-Pace’s cen­tre con­sole re­tains phys­i­cal di­als and but­tons for air-con­di­tion­ing, vol­ume and some mi­nor con­trols, the one in the Model X has only an im­mense 17-inch por­trait-style touch­screen, on which you can not only ac­cess the full suite of set­tings and an­cil­lary con­trols, but also op­er­ate the doors and tail­gate, ad­just the ride height, surf the Net and even use as a sketch­pad.</p>
    <p>Just like your mo­bile phone, the Tesla can re­ceive over-the-air soft­ware up­dates, so it can be up­graded with new fea­tures and ca­pa­bil­i­ties as they are re­leased.</p>
    <p>Un­der­neath, th­ese cars have some strik­ing sim­i­lar­i­ties as well as</p>
    <p>sub­tle but dis­tinc­tive dif­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>For a start, their pow­er­trains are built around twin trans­versely mounted elec­tric mo­tors, each driv­ing a pair of wheels.</p>
    <p>The Jaguar’s mo­tors are rated at 200hp each, while the heav­ier Tesla packs about 30 per cent more power with 259hp each. Plus, there is plenty of torque – 658Nm from the Tesla and 696Nm from the Jaguar, mak­ing them both re­mark­ably ac­cel­er­a­tive off any lights and a joy when­ver you squeeze the “throt­tle” pedal.</p>
    <p>Be­tween the axles sits a low­pro­file alu­minium case with an in­te­grated liq­uid cool­ing sys­tem that houses the en­tire pack of lithium-ion bat­ter­ies – 75kWh in the Tesla and 90kWh in the Jaguar.</p>
    <p>Weigh­ing more than 500kg in ei­ther of th­ese cars, this en­er­gys­tor­age bank’s rigid hous­ing and lo­ca­tion low down in the chas­sis con­trib­ute sig­nif­i­cantly to the ve­hi­cles’ min­i­mal roll in cor­ner­ing and over­all dy­namic sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Some dif­fer­ences in de­sign philoso­phies emerge when we take a closer look at the mo­tor and driv­e­train. Al­though both op­er­ate on al­ter­nat­ing cur­rent (AC), Tesla uses an in­duc­tion mo­tor. The Jaguar, on the other hand, uses the cur­rent favourite among EV makers – a syn­chro­nous AC mo­tor which is slightly costlier, but marginally more ef­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>But for this test-drive, the Jaguar av­er­aged 22kWh/100km, while the heav­ier Tesla re­turned a bet­ter 20kWh/100km.</p>
    <p>Trans­mit­ting power to the wheels is a rel­a­tively un­com­pli­cated af­fair com­pared with any petrol or diesel mo­tor­car. All that is nec­es­sary is a fixed sin­gle-ra­tio gear­box be­cause the mo­tors are ba­si­cally con­stant torque units.</p>
    <p>In split­ting the power left and right, Tesla uses a con­ven­tional dif­fer­en­tial, while the Jaguar has an epicyclic type of trans­fer unit. No lim­ited-slip set-up here. In­stead, trac­tion man­age­ment via se­lec­tive brak­ing and elec­tronic power con­trol means you are never left with any wheel spin­ning hope­lessly in slip­pery sit­u­a­tions in ei­ther car.</p>
    <p>De­void of an in­ter­nal com­bus­tion en­gine, nei­ther car can rely on an ex­hil­a­rat­ing en­gine note or snappy gear changes to thrill. But they de­light with their in­stant torque (a char­ac­ter­is­tic of all EVs).</p>
    <p>In the I-Pace, the mo­tors silently whisk you to 100kmh in a sportscar-like 4.8 sec­onds. It also scythes through bends with happy aban­don, chang­ing tack far more keenly and with less roll than many lower-slung sedans, de­spite its 2.1-tonne weight.</p>
    <p>The Tesla be­lies its size and weight by hit­ting 100kmh in 5.2 sec­onds (not far off the smaller Jaguar’s tim­ing), and also by be­ing sur­pris­ingly deft and grippy even when pushed hard through bends.</p>
    <p>De­spite its air springs, its ride can get dis­turbed by small ruts and im­per­fec­tions, but gen­er­ally, it re­mains com­posed and planted.</p>
    <p>Of the pair, the I-Pace is clearly the en­thu­si­ast’s choice, but the Tesla is the bet­ter all-pur­pose fam­ily car and also the techie’s de­light.</p>
