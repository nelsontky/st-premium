    <p>Travel and tourism play­ers yes­ter­day wel­comed Sin­ga­pore’s – and the Asia-Pa­cific’s – first phys­i­cal trade show since the start of the Covid-19 out­break, a key step to­wards hav­ing more such trade shows here.</p>
    <p>Trav­elRe­vive, a two-day trade show be­ing held at Sands Expo and Con­ven­tion Cen­tre un­til to­day, was made pos­si­ble with the in­tro­duc­tion of new safety mea­sures to help en­sure the health and safety of ex­hibitors and at­ten­dees.</p>
    <p>Among the ex­hibitors at Trav­elRe­vive was tech so­lu­tions firm LDR, which has de­signed walk­ing tours and re­cently piv­oted to pro­vid­ing so­lu­tions for vir­tual con­fer­ences and events.</p>
    <p>LDR busi­ness de­vel­op­ment man­ager Kelvin Yeo said that while the trade show was rather quiet, he prefers a quiet phys­i­cal show over a vir­tual one even if the lat­ter may come with more meet­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>“I’d rather have one qual­ity con­ver­sa­tion in per­son than 100 con­ver­sa­tions over Zoom,” he said, not­ing that vir­tual con­fer­ences and meet­ings with mul­ti­ple break­out rooms can be chaotic.</p>
    <p>Trav­elRe­vive is the first pi­lot trade show held in Sin­ga­pore un­der the newly de­vel­oped hy­brid event trade show pro­to­type for safe busi­ness events, safe itin­er­ar­ies and dig­i­tal en­abler tools, as part of a col­lab­o­ra­tion un­der one of the Emerg­ing Stronger Task­force’s Al­liance for Ac­tion groups.</p>
    <p>This pro­to­type is for larger events with more at­ten­dees than the limit of 250 im­posed for meet­ing, in­cen­tive, con­ven­tion and ex­hi­bi­tion (Mice) events, for which the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) con­tin­ues to ac­cept pi­lot ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Trav­elRe­vive is the first phys­i­cal trade show held here since the Sin­ga­pore Airshow in Fe­bru­ary. The hy­brid event also fea­tures vir­tual con­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>Close to 1,000 at­ten­dees and ex­hibitors are ex­pected on site, in­clud­ing some 65 for­eign del­e­gates from 14 coun­tries. The or­gan­is­ers are STB and Messe Ber­lin (Sin­ga­pore).</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 36 ex­hi­bi­tion booths have been set up, with each ex­hibitor get­ting a ded­i­cated meet­ing pod. These booths and pods are equipped with plex­i­glass pan­els, which en­able face-to-face dis­cus­sions to be held safely.</p>
    <p>The Ware­house Ho­tel di­rec­tor of sales Elaine Luei said that while there are fewer buy­ers at the event com­pared with preCovid-19 trade shows, the mea­sures put in place – such as the plex­i­glass shields at each meet­ing pod – are thor­ough and “help to pro­tect peo­ple”.</p>
    <p>“The or­gan­is­ers were quite proac­tive in telling us what to ex­pect,” she added.</p>
    <p>As part of safe man­age­ment mea­sures, at­ten­dees were sep­a­rated into co­horts of 20 and in­ter­ac­tions were lim­ited across groups. They were also given TraceTo­gether to­kens to fa­cil­i­tate con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>For­eign del­e­gates and some lo­cal at­ten­dees and ex­hibitors were re­quired to take anti­gen rapid tests yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>STB ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor for ex­hi­bi­tions and con­fer­ences An­drew Phua ex­plained that dif­fer­ent test­ing ap­proaches are be­ing used for the var­i­ous Mice events.</p>
    <p>“For each pi­lot event, we work closely with the Min­istry of Health. It’s re­ally quite cus­tomised in (see­ing what is) the best way and best ap­proach to test... and at the same time, en­sure that ev­ery­body is tested safely and busi­ness events can be held in a safe and trusted man­ner,” he said, adding that about 500 peo­ple will be tested per day at Trav­elRe­vive.</p>
    <p>Safe itin­er­ar­ies, which in­clude pri­vate mu­seum vis­its and vir­tual tours, have been cu­rated for for­eign del­e­gates, who need to take a test on al­ter­nate days, in ad­di­tion to the tests re­quired on event days.</p>
    <p>Changi Air­port Group has also de­vel­oped an on­line tool called the Safe Travel Concierge to help trav­ellers cus­tomise a travel check­list of pre-en­try re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Among the for­eign del­e­gates at the event yes­ter­day was Ms Nat­jariya Rod­prukpoom, manag­ing di­rec­tor of Thai­land-based tour agency Asia Hub, who is in Sin­ga­pore un­til Saturday.</p>
    <p>She is here not only to meet some ho­tel and at­trac­tion part­ners, but also to as­sess the sit­u­a­tion for tourists here.</p>
    <p>“We want to know how Sin­ga­pore takes care of the tourists, how it con­trols the (in­fec­tion spread), and what is go­ing on with the tourist in­dus­try in Asia. Com­ing here, I see how Sin­ga­pore has de­vel­oped the tech­nol­ogy to (track us and our itin­er­ar­ies), and Sin­ga­pore has done very well,” she said.</p>
