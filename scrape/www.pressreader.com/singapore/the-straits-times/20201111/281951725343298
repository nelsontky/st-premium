    <p>For months, an­a­lysts have been spec­u­lat­ing on what would hap­pen to the United States, global economies and fi­nan­cial mar­kets in the event of a Bi­den pres­i­dency, which is fi­nally at hand. But while there is hope for an over­haul of many eco­nomic and so­cial poli­cies, the path ahead is strewn with po­lit­i­cal ob­sta­cles.</p>
    <p>Far from a land­slide as Demo­cratic Party hope­fuls had ex­pected, the 2020 pres­i­den­tial race was a dra­matic nail-biter, with a come-from-be­hind vic­tory for Mr Joe Bi­den af­ter photo fin­ishes in at least three states.</p>
    <p>Amid a po­lit­i­cally po­larised na­tion, the bal­ance of power be­tween the Democrats and Repub­li­cans in the Se­nate is still up in the air. There are two run-off Se­nate races sched­uled for Jan 5, and only if the Democrats win them both will they gain con­trol of the Up­per House of Congress (as­sisted by Vice-Pres­i­dent-elect Ka­mala Har­ris’ tie-breaker vote), which would make a vast dif­fer­ence to the shape of poli­cies.</p>
    <p>But re­gard­less of the com­po­si­tion of the Se­nate, the first or­der of busi­ness for the</p>
    <p>Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will be to de­feat the Covid-19 pan­demic, which has dev­as­tated the US econ­omy and turned more vir­u­lent in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>The Bi­den team has al­ready an­nounced a new Covid-19 task force. Get­ting the pan­demic un­der con­trol would be the best thing the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion could do for the econ­omy in the short term.</p>
    <p>The com­po­si­tion of the Se­nate will be known by the time</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den is sworn in on Jan 20. Un­der a Demo­crat-con­trolled Se­nate, eco­nomic poli­cies will take a sharp turn to the left. There would be a mas­sive fis­cal stim­u­lus, higher taxes, es­pe­cially on the rich, and a dou­bling of the fed­eral min­i­mum wage to US$15 (S$20) an hour. The na­tional debt will rise sharply and will have to be mon­e­tised by the US Fed­eral</p>
    <p>Re­serve. The stock mar­ket may turn chop­pier and the US dol­lar weaker. In­fla­tion could re­turn sooner than many ex­pect. There will be a rad­i­cally dif­fer­ent en­ergy pol­icy and tougher reg­u­la­tion of tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies, and trade poli­cies will be more mea­sured and pre­dictable, al­though not nec­es­sar­ily more open. Let’s un­pack this list, start­ing with the stim­u­lus.</p>
    <p>A MON­STER STIM­U­LUS?</p>
    <p>With the US econ­omy in re­ces­sion and unem­ploy­ment still high at close to 7 per cent, fis­cal stim­u­lus is in­evitable – the only ques­tion is its size.</p>
    <p>With a Demo­crat-con­trolled Se­nate, it would be a mon­ster stim­u­lus, amount­ing to at least US$2 tril­lion to start with, which is what House leader Nancy Pelosi had de­manded in her ne­go­ti­a­tions with the Repub­li­cans over the last two months. Given the Democrats’ am­bi­tious spend­ing plans, the stim­u­lus could get big­ger still – even to US$5 tril­lion over the term of the Bi­den pres­i­dency, depend­ing on how the pan­demic and eco­nomic re­cov­ery play out.</p>
    <p>But un­der a Repub­li­can-con­trolled Se­nate, the stim­u­lus would be slashed to around US$1 tril­lion at first and many of the Democrats’ other spend­ing plans would run into a wall of op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>But re­gard­less of the Se­nate elec­tion out­come, there will be huge spend­ing on in­fra­struc­ture, which is one of the few is­sues on which both par­ties agree. Funds will be poured into high-speed rail, ports, bridges, green en­ergy and the ex­pan­sion of broad­band and wire­less in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>Un­der a Demo­crat-con­trolled Se­nate, there will also be more spend­ing on health, ed­u­ca­tion and re­search and de­vel­op­ment and, over­all, a greater im­pact on gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) growth.</p>
    <p>Which party con­trols the Se­nate will also de­ter­mine how the fis­cal largesse will be fi­nanced. If the Democrats get a ma­jor­ity, there will be higher taxes. Mr Bi­den has pro­posed rais­ing the top in­come tax rate to 39.6 per cent (from 37 per cent at present), and the top cor­po­rate tax rate to 28 per cent, from 21 per cent.</p>
    <p>A Repub­li­can-con­trolled Se­nate would block such tax in­creases. In that event, the Fed would need to do more of the heavy lift­ing to cush­ion the econ­omy. US in­ter­est rates would be lower for longer. Even with higher taxes, the Fed would need to get more ac­tive, be­cause the tax rev­enues would not be able to cover the in­creases in spend­ing.</p>
    <p>The US bud­get deficit – cur­rently about 20 per cent of GDP, the high­est since World War II – will rise fur­ther, as will na­tional debt, which is al­ready on track to hit close to 100 per cent of GDP by the end of this year. Much of it will have to be mon­e­tised by the Fed.</p>
    <p>Al­though dis­in­fla­tion­ary pres­sures are preva­lent now amid a weak econ­omy, this could start to change once the spend­ing starts to have an im­pact, es­pe­cially un­der a Demo­crat-con­trolled Se­nate.</p>
    <p>The im­pact will be dif­fer­ent from that un­leashed af­ter the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis of 2008, most of which went to re­cap­i­talise banks, which were slow to lend it out. This time, most of the spend­ing will go di­rectly into the real econ­omy. This will even­tu­ally trans­late into in­fla­tion, which could start to take off in the sec­ond half of the Bi­den term. As in­fla­tion starts to be priced in, US Trea­suries will sell off. Ris­ing in­fla­tion could also prompt in­ter­est rate in­creases by 2024.</p>
    <p>The ris­ing deficits and debts, as well as their mon­eti­sa­tion by the Fed, will be a net neg­a­tive for the US dol­lar, which would add to US in­fla­tion­ary pres­sures. This could prompt in­vestors to switch into hard as­sets such as pre­cious me­tals, com­modi­ties and real es­tate, as well as bit­coin.</p>
    <p>CHOPPY STOCK MAR­KETS</p>
    <p>The stock mar­ket, al­though in­vari­ably un­pre­dictable, could run into head­winds even be­fore the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion be­gins. Mr Bi­den plans to al­most dou­ble the cap­i­tal gains tax from 20 per cent to 39.6 per cent for in­di­vid­u­als earn­ing over US$1 mil­lion, al­though Repub­li­cans would try to block this.</p>
    <p>Some of these in­di­vid­u­als would be sit­ting on huge cap­i­tal gains, es­pe­cially in tech­nol­ogy stocks, which have been on a tear this year. For in­stance, since their lows in mid-March, the gains amount to about 50 per cent for Mi­crosoft, 55 per cent for Google, 80 per cent for Ama­zon and Face­book, 94 per cent for Ap­ple and 350 per cent for Tesla. Many in­vestors in these and other big win­ning stocks may be tempted to book their prof­its be­fore the higher cap­i­tal gains tax kicks in.</p>
    <p>Given that just five tech stocks ac­count for around 25 per cent of the S&P 500, this means that the S&P 500 would lose ground. Some an­a­lysts such as Mr Ben Snider of Gold­man Sachs also sug­gest that by boost­ing the econ­omy, the Bi­den stim­u­lus would be rel­a­tively bet­ter for cycli­cal stocks, such as those of tra­di­tional in­dus­trial and con­sumer goods com­pa­nies, rather than the tech-ori­ented “growth” stocks whose earn­ings are less sen­si­tive to eco­nomic growth.</p>
    <p>One sec­tor that might look es­pe­cially promis­ing un­der a</p>
    <p>Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion and a Demo­crat-con­trolled Se­nate would be green en­ergy, in which the ad­min­is­tra­tion plans to pour tril­lions of dol­lars. In an­tic­i­pa­tion, green en­ergy stocks have soared. For in­stance, the In­vesco So­lar ETF, which in­vests in so­lar en­ergy com­pa­nies, is up more than</p>
    <p>200 per cent since mid-March, and the mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of wind and so­lar en­ergy com­pany</p>
    <p>Nex­tEra ex­ceeds that of oil gi­ant ExxonMo­bil.</p>
    <p>De­spite the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion’s an­tipa­thy to­wards the fos­sil fu­els in­dus­try, oil prices may iron­i­cally ben­e­fit, at least ini­tially. A fis­cal stim­u­lus would boost de­mand for oil.</p>
    <p>Cut­backs in fos­sil fuel sub­si­dies and new re­stric­tions on frack­ing would take some shale oil and gas off the mar­ket, ef­fec­tively re­duc­ing sup­ply.</p>
    <p>TECH LASH</p>
    <p>Al­ready fac­ing heat from the US Jus­tice De­part­ment, which is pre­par­ing a law­suit against Google for an­titrust vi­o­la­tions, the US tech sec­tor could come un­der broader and tougher scru­tiny un­der the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The US House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives re­cently re­leased a 449-page re­port fol­low­ing a 16-month in­ves­ti­ga­tion into Ama­zon, Ap­ple, Face­book and Google. The re­port calls for sweep­ing new reg­u­la­tions to rein in their mo­nop­oly pow­ers, in­clud­ing break­ing up the com­pa­nies. There could be epic le­gal bat­tles be­tween the US gov­ern­ment and big tech dur­ing the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion. While the out­come is un­cer­tain, the fu­ture of some tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies will be clouded by un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>In the area of trade, all eyes will be on how the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will ap­proach deal­ings with China. While it is un­likely to con­tinue the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s tar­iff wars on China, many ex­perts like Eura­sia Group pres­i­dent Ian Brem­mer be­lieve that it would not re­move tar­iffs on China with­out get­ting some­thing in re­turn. Nor would it take a softer line on Chi­nese tech com­pa­nies like Huawei, which many Democrats, like the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, also view as a se­cu­rity threat.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion, the US might re­vive the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion and seek to re­join the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship, both of which would be good for Asian economies, al­though US trade ne­go­tia­tors might push for tougher labour and en­vi­ron­men­tal stan­dards.</p>
    <p>How­ever, at the same time, the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion would of­fer in­cen­tives such as tax cred­its to reshore pro­duc­tion of crit­i­cal prod­ucts, plus tax penal­ties for off­shoring. There might also be “buy Amer­i­can” pro­vi­sions in gov­ern­ment pro­cure­ment.</p>
    <p>Thus on the whole, while trade pol­icy will be­come less un­pre­dictable, it is not clear whether it will be more open. Free trade does not have a large con­stituency among Democrats, es­pe­cially when the do­mes­tic econ­omy is weak. Un­der the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, Repub­li­cans have also largely aban­doned their tra­di­tional free trade agenda.</p>
    <p>But the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion’s eco­nomic stim­u­lus would ben­e­fit Asian ex­ports, more so with a Demo­crat-con­trolled Se­nate. Higher US cor­po­rate and cap­i­tal gains taxes cou­pled with a weak­en­ing dol­lar would make Asian (and other emerg­ing mar­ket) as­sets more at­trac­tive to in­vestors than US as­sets.</p>
    <p>All told, Asian economies and in­vestors would have lit­tle to fear from a Bi­den pres­i­dency, at least in its early phase. Given the still-rag­ing pan­demic and the ex­tra­or­di­nary poli­cies it has trig­gered, the new pres­i­dency will not nec­es­sar­ily mark a re­turn to eco­nomic nor­malcy, only to a more ra­tional, pro-mul­ti­lat­eral and pre­dictable US ad­min­is­tra­tion. But that would be a big change.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion, the US might re­vive the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion and seek to re­join the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship, both of which would be good for Asian economies, al­though US trade ne­go­tia­tors might push for tougher labour and en­vi­ron­men­tal stan­dards.</p>
