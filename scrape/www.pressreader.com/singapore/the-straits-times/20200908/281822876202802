    <p>LHOK­SE­U­MAWE Nearly 300 Ro­hingya mi­grants came ashore on In­done­sia’s Su­ma­tra is­land early yes­ter­day, the author­i­ties said, in one of the big­gest such land­ings by the per­se­cuted Myan­mar mi­nor­ity in the Mus­lim-ma­jor­ity na­tion in years.</p>
    <p>The mi­grants, in­clud­ing more than a dozen chil­dren, were spot­ted at sea by lo­cals who helped them land near Lhok­se­u­mawe city on Su­ma­tra’s north­ern coast, ac­cord­ing to Mr Mu­nir Cut Ali, the head of Ujong Blang vil­lage. “We saw a boat com­ing ashore in Ujong Blang and so then we helped them land safely,” Mr Ali told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>At least one mem­ber of the group – which com­prised 102 men, 181 women and 14 chil­dren – was ill and had to be rushed to a lo­cal hos­pi­tal for treat­ment, said the area’s mil­i­tary chief Roni Ma­hen­dra.</p>
    <p>He said that the group would need to be tested for the coro­n­avirus. “Later, the lo­cal gov­ern­ment will find a proper place to house them.”</p>
    <p>It was not im­me­di­ately clear how long the mi­grants had been at sea or what type of ves­sel they ar­rived in. The res­cued group of 297 was re­ported to be the largest to land in In­done­sia since at least 2015.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent comes af­ter about 100 Ro­hingya, mostly women and chil­dren, ar­rived in the same area in June fol­low­ing what they de­scribed as a per­ilous four-month sea jour­ney that saw them beaten by traf­fick­ers and forced to drink their own urine to stay alive.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the Mus­lim-mi­nor­ity</p>
    <p>group said they had set off ear­lier this year near a Ro­hingya refugee camp in Bangladesh, next to their na­tive Myan­mar.</p>
    <p>Around a mil­lion Ro­hingya live in cramped and squalid refugee camps in Bangladesh, where hu­man traf­fick­ers also run lu­cra­tive op­er­a­tions promis­ing to find them sanc­tu­ary abroad.</p>
    <p>Mus­lim-ma­jor­ity In­done­sia and neigh­bour­ing Malaysia are favoured des­ti­na­tions for Ro­hingya flee­ing per­se­cu­tion and vi­o­lence in mostly Bud­dhist Myan­mar.</p>
    <p>In July, the Malaysian author­i­ties said some two dozen Ro­hingya mi­grants – feared to have drowned off the coun­try’s coast af­ter a treach­er­ous boat cross­ing – had been found alive, hid­ing in bushes on an is­land.</p>
