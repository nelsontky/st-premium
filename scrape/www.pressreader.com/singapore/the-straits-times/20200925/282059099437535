    <p>Both GIC and Te­masek have taken steps to cush­ion them­selves from the im­pact of Covid-19 but will con­tinue to po­si­tion them­selves for fu­ture op­por­tu­ni­ties, said Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Madam Hal­imah said she had re­ceived a brief­ing by Sin­ga­pore sov­er­eign wealth fund GIC and in­vest­ment com­pany Te­masek on the in­vest­ment out­look.</p>
    <p>She added: “Both GIC and Te­masek in­vest our re­serves, so it is im­por­tant that I am pe­ri­od­i­cally briefed on their global eco­nomic out­look, in­vest­ment strate­gies and per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>“More so for this year’s brief­ings, given the im­pact of the on­go­ing pan­demic on their in­vest­ments.”</p>
    <p>Te­masek’s net port­fo­lio was val­ued at $306 bil­lion as at March 31, 2.2 per cent lower than last year’s record $313 bil­lion, it said in its an­nual re­view on Sept 8.</p>
    <p>In her post, Madam Hal­imah noted that Covid-19 has fun­da­men­tally changed the world, with many in­vestors tak­ing a hit. Sin­ga­pore’s in­vest­ment en­ti­ties were no dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>But both GIC and Te­masek have taken steps to cush­ion the im­pact, she added.</p>
    <p>“More im­por­tantly, as ev­ery­one ad­justs to a new post-Covid-19 world and a reshuf­fling of the de­mand and sup­ply chains, it is im­por­tant that GIC and Te­masek con­tinue to po­si­tion them­selves for fu­ture op­por­tu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah said she re­ceives up­dates reg­u­larly, at least twice a year, with this year’s meet­ing held vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>The an­nual brief­ings, she added, are use­ful for her to en­gage both en­ti­ties on their mar­ket out­look, which is a main fac­tor in their pro­jec­tion of ex­pected longterm re­turns.</p>
    <p>“So it is im­per­a­tive that in think­ing about the es­ti­mates of the long-term ex­pected re­turns, care­ful at­ten­tion is paid to how struc­tural and sec­u­lar trends could af­fect the re­serves and NIRC,” she said.</p>
    <p>The Net In­vest­ment Re­turns Con­tri­bu­tion (NIRC) com­prises 50 per cent of the net in­vest­ment re­turns on net as­sets in­vested by the Mon­e­tary Authority of Sin­ga­pore, GIC, and Te­masek – the three en­ti­ties tasked with man­ag­ing and in­vest­ing the re­serves – and 50 per cent of the net in­vest­ment in­come de­rived from past re­serves from the re­main­ing as­sets.</p>
    <p>The NIRC is the top con­trib­u­tor to the gov­ern­ment cof­fers.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Net In­vest­ment Re­turns (NIR) frame­work, the Gov­ern­ment can spend up to 50 per cent of the long-term ex­pected real re­turns, in­clud­ing cap­i­tal gains, on the rel­e­vant as­sets.</p>
    <p>Ex­pected, in­stead of ac­tual, rates of re­turn are used to pro­vide some smooth­ness over the years in the amount of NIR that can be spent.</p>
