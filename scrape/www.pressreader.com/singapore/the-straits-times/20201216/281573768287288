    <p>The Covid-19 eco­nomic cri­sis could morph into a cor­po­rate debt and bank­ing cri­sis. The first or­der of busi­ness should be for coun­tries to cre­ate strong frame­works to deal with in­sol­ven­cies, and the next should be to ac­cel­er­ate eco­nomic re­cov­ery by chan­nelling liq­uid­ity to de­serv­ing sec­tors, says as­so­ciate ed­i­tor Vikram Khanna.</p>
    <p>Eco­nomic crises have a ten­dency to morph. Af­ter a cri­sis gets un­der way, its epi­cen­tre can shift and it can turn con­ta­gious in un­pre­dictable ways, im­pact­ing ar­eas pre­vi­ously pre­sumed rel­a­tively safe.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, what starts as a do­mes­tic cri­sis can take on re­gional di­men­sions, af­fect­ing even healthy economies, as we saw in Asia in 1997, or go global, as hap­pened af­ter the United States sub­prime mort­gage cri­sis of 2007-2008. Crises can also spread quickly from one sec­tor to an­other and then en­gulf en­tire economies. Europe’s real es­tate crises in 2008 mor­phed into bank­ing crises a year later and then into a euro zone-wide sov­er­eign debt cri­sis by 2012.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 started out as a health cri­sis, which it still is. But it quickly be­came an eco­nomic cri­sis in the face of lock­downs, sup­ply chain dis­rup­tions and the near-to­tal clo­sure of in­dus­tries such as in­ter­na­tional travel and tourism, parts of re­tail and hos­pi­tal­ity, live en­ter­tain­ment and nightlife.</p>
    <p>With vac­cines be­ing rolled out, eco­nomic re­cov­ery is now within sight. Yet, there is rea­son to be­lieve that we may still be only at the end of the be­gin­ning of what could be­come yet an­other rolling cri­sis.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with The Straits Times, Mr Al­fonso Gar­cia Mora, vice-pres­i­dent for the Asia-Pa­cific at the In­ter­na­tional Fi­nance Cor­po­ra­tion (IFC) – the World Bank’s pri­vate-sec­tor lend­ing arm – pro­vided some clues as to what might lie ahead, and what needs to be done.</p>
    <p>The im­me­di­ate im­pact of Covid-19 on com­pa­nies, he pointed out, was a short­age of liq­uid­ity be­cause of the col­lapse of de­mand and the dis­rup­tion of sup­ply chains, which led to se­vere cash flow prob­lems. This was largely re­solved, mostly by cen­tral banks, which pumped huge amounts of liq­uid­ity into economies.</p>
    <p>THE COM­ING SOL­VENCY CRI­SIS</p>
    <p>But cen­tral banks can’t deal with sol­vency is­sues, which are the next threat. The de­mand shock has led to sol­vency prob­lems be­cause many com­pa­nies can’t pay their es­sen­tial ex­penses. “This is what is un­fold­ing now,” said Mr Gar­cia Mora, es­pe­cially in the sec­tors worst im­pacted by the cri­sis, such as tourism, which in some coun­tries ac­counts for as much as 10 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct.</p>
    <p>Across economies, about half of firms won’t be able to ser­vice their loans. Bank­rupt­cies could in­crease by 30 per cent in the Asia-Pa­cific over the com­ing year, he said.</p>
    <p>So far, bank­rupt­cies re­sult­ing from the Covid-19 down­turn have re­mained largely bot­tled up, mainly be­cause of govern­ment as­sis­tance, re­laxed bank­ruptcy laws and for­bear­ance by banks. In Sin­ga­pore, for ex­am­ple, be­sides pro­vid­ing fi­nan­cial sup­port, the Govern­ment has man­dated mora­to­ri­ums on le­gal ac­tion over rents and con­tracts, and raised the thresh­olds for bank­ruptcy and in­sol­vency pro­ceed­ings. Banks have been al­low­ing small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) to de­fer re­pay­ments since April. They might ex­tend the de­fer­rals be­yond this year on a case-by-case ba­sis. Many other coun­tries have adopted sim­i­lar mea­sures.</p>
    <p>But when the eco­nomic re­cov­ery gets un­der way, the for­bear­ance by banks will end and laws will re­vert to nor­mal. The lagged ef­fects of neg­a­tive growth will also start to be felt. That is when bank­rupt­cies could start to take off.</p>
    <p>A SHOCK FOR BANKS</p>
    <p>Ris­ing bank­rupt­cies could de­liver a rude shock to many banks, which may not have been mon­i­tor­ing the sol­vency of their bor­row­ers dur­ing the for­bear­ance pe­riod. So while, right now, banks’ non-per­form­ing loans (NPLs) may seem low and man­age­able, the pic­ture could change dra­mat­i­cally once for­bear­ance ends, and the later it ends, the more dra­matic will be the change.</p>
    <p>“When for­bear­ance was an­nounced, we thought it would last three months to six months,” said Mr Gar­cia Mora. “But we have al­ready passed nine months, and there may be three to four months more to go be­fore for­bear­ance ends.” When that hap­pens, banks could dis­cover that their NPLs are not 2 per cent to 3 per cent as they were six months ear­lier, but in dou­ble dig­its.</p>
    <p>“The bank­ing sec­tors of some coun­tries could be­come stressed, es­pe­cially those that en­tered the cri­sis with al­ready weak fi­nan­cial sec­tors,” said Mr Gar­cia Mora. “As of to­day we don’t have enough in­for­ma­tion to say whether banks will need to be bailed out, but we ex­pect there will be cases which will need sup­port.”</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has al­ready mor­phed from a health cri­sis into a cri­sis of neg­a­tive growth and ris­ing un­em­ploy­ment. It could morph fur­ther into a cor­po­rate debt and bank­ing cri­sis. So what needs to be done?</p>
    <p>DEAL­ING WITH IN­SOL­VEN­CIES</p>
    <p>The first or­der of busi­ness should be for coun­tries to cre­ate strong frame­works to deal with in­sol­ven­cies. Many coun­tries in the Asia-Pa­cific don’t have one, Mr Gar­cia Mora pointed out.</p>
    <p>The goal should be to en­sure, first, that firms which are still sol­vent, but fac­ing cash flow prob­lems, re­struc­ture so they can con­tinue op­er­a­tions; and sec­ond, that firms which have be­come un­vi­able go into bank­ruptcy and get liq­ui­dated.</p>
    <p>Mr Gar­cia Mora pro­posed that ideally, these is­sues should be tack­led through out-of-court pro­cesses. “There shouldn’t be a need to go through the ju­di­cial sys­tem, which can be slow and cum­ber­some,” he said. “For­mal bank­ruptcy pro­ceed­ings might be ap­pro­pri­ate for large cor­po­rates with com­plex struc­tures. But the struc­ture of most SMEs is rel­a­tively sim­ple. So what is needed are fast pro­cesses that can be im­ple­mented im­me­di­ately.”</p>
    <p>He is hes­i­tant to rec­om­mend that gov­ern­ments take equity stakes in trou­bled com­pa­nies. One prob­lem is that hav­ing al­ready run up huge fis­cal deficits dur­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis so far, most gov­ern­ments lack the fis­cal space to bail out com­pa­nies on a large scale. An­other is that mech­a­nisms for the govern­ment to un­wind its in­vest­ments can be prob­lem­atic. “There are many cases where gov­ern­ments have bailed out pri­vate firms and there was no way for those gov­ern­ments to exit for a long time,” Mr Gar­cia Mora said.</p>
    <p>A prefer­able so­lu­tion, he sug­gested, would be for gov­ern­ments to “crowd-in” the pri­vate sec­tor to take over vi­able but trou­bled com­pa­nies, by pro­vid­ing seed fi­nanc­ing or guar­an­tees. Only in cases where pri­vate cap­i­tal is not forth­com­ing, there are clear path­ways to exit, and bailouts are in the pub­lic in­ter­est, should gov­ern­ments take equity stakes.</p>
    <p>REALLOCATI­NG CAP­I­TAL</p>
    <p>Once in­sol­ven­cies are dealt with, the next pri­or­ity should be to ac­cel­er­ate the eco­nomic re­cov­ery by chan­nelling liq­uid­ity se­lec­tively to de­serv­ing sec­tors. What will be needed, Mr Gar­cia Mora said, is “a mas­sive re­al­lo­ca­tion of cap­i­tal”.</p>
    <p>This will be a tricky ex­er­cise. The gen­eral man­ager of the Bank for In­ter­na­tional Set­tle­ments, Mr Agustin Carstens, has pointed out that while eco­nomic growth will even­tu­ally re­turn, “the en­gines will not be the same... the eco­nomic land­scape may have fun­da­men­tally changed”.</p>
    <p>There will be more dig­i­tal adop­tion in sev­eral sec­tors, and con­sumer at­ti­tudes will have changed and may never re­turn to what they were, pre-pan­demic. There will, for ex­am­ple, be more re­mote work, less travel, less off­line shop­ping and less eat­ing out. While such trends will strengthen some sec­tors, “they will also turn once-thriv­ing sec­tors into dead­wood”. If pol­i­cy­mak­ers try to prop up busi­nesses in these sec­tors, they could add pres­sure to the bank­ing sys­tem and ex­ac­er­bate the eco­nomic con­trac­tion as well as job losses.</p>
    <p>De­cid­ing which sec­tors merit sup­port won’t be easy, Mr Carstens added. “Pre-cri­sis per­for­mance alone will not pro­vide an ac­cu­rate guide.” Banks can help iden­tify the ap­pro­pri­ate tar­gets. But they too would need to re­vise the types of clients they lend to. Thus, as the Covid-19 cri­sis morphs, the re­sponses to it – from gov­ern­ments, banks and com­pa­nies – will also need to change.</p>
    <p>There will be more dig­i­tal adop­tion in sev­eral sec­tors, and con­sumer at­ti­tudes will have changed and may never re­turn to what they were, pre-pan­demic. There will, for ex­am­ple, be more re­mote work, less travel, less off­line shop­ping and less eat­ing out. While such trends will strengthen some sec­tors, “they will also turn once-thriv­ing sec­tors into dead­wood”.</p>
