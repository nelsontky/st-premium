    <p>In a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion, United States for­eign pol­icy will shift sig­nif­i­cantly from Mr Don­ald Trump’s pro­tec­tion­ist ver­sion of an “Amer­ica First” ap­proach. Given the reach of Amer­i­can in­flu­ence and law, this change in di­rec­tion will af­fect global busi­nesses as well.</p>
    <p>As cor­po­rate lead­ers prepare to adapt their busi­ness op­er­a­tions and strat­egy to this new par­a­digm, it helps to look at four for­eign pol­icy sign­posts for the road ahead – the US will now en­gage mul­ti­lat­er­ally, in­cor­po­rate sus­tain­abil­ity, shift in a pro-demo­cratic di­rec­tion and no longer ap­proach trade trans­ac­tion­ally.</p>
    <p>GREEN LIGHT FOR GREEN PROJECTS</p>
    <p>As Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den plans for the US to “Build Back Bet­ter” in a sus­tain­able way do­mes­ti­cally, the in­com­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion like­wise will fo­cus on in­cor­po­rat­ing the en­vi­ron­ment into its for­eign pol­icy frame­work.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ingly, cor­po­rate lead­ers should plan how to in­cor­po­rate cli­mate change into their in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties and busi­ness op­er­a­tions from both a risk and op­por­tu­nity per­spec­tive.</p>
    <p>While Mr Bi­den’s pledge to in­vest US$1.7 tril­lion (S$2.3 tril­lion) in re­new­ables and cli­mate research over the next decade will run into a road­block in a Repub­li­can­con­trolled Se­nate, there will be fewer re­stric­tions on in­cor­po­rat­ing cli­mate ac­tion into for­eign pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s cli­mate diplo­macy will ex­tend be­yond the US re­join­ing the Paris Agree­ment. He will work with long­stand­ing al­lies such as Ja­pan, South Korea and Aus­tralia to back trade and in­vest­ment poli­cies that price en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact into the cost of do­ing busi­ness.</p>
    <p>With an eye to­wards rein­vig­o­rat­ing the US’ al­liances and re­gain­ing global stature, the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion can be ex­pected to ex­er­cise in­flu­ence at mul­ti­lat­eral devel­op­ment fi­nance in­sti­tu­tions such as the In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the Asian Devel­op­ment Bank to pri­ori­tise green in­fra­struc­ture projects and pro­vide op­por­tu­ni­ties for in­vest­ment in such projects, par­tic­u­larly in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>For its own part, the US In­ter­na­tional Devel­op­ment Fi­nance Cor­po­ra­tion will play a more cen­tral role in for­eign pol­icy, and busi­nesses and in­vestors should look to part­ner with the US gov­ern­ment as it in­vests in sus­tain­able in­fra­struc­ture in Asean, in part to com­pete with China’s Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>DEMOC­RACY AND HU­MAN RIGHTS TO THE FORE</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Trump did not ig­nore hu­man rights when it came to US for­eign pol­icy. He sim­ply ap­plied it in a trans­ac­tional man­ner. For ex­am­ple, his ad­min­is­tra­tion au­tho­rised sanc­tions against those deemed to have un­der­mined Hong Kong’s au­ton­omy from main­land China but only af­ter it be­came a done deal and when such ac­tion would not im­pact neg­a­tively the US-China trade deal.</p>
    <p>A Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will re­store a more con­sis­tent and across-the-board ef­fort with a val­ues-based for­eign pol­icy as the foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness lead­ers need to prepare for an ac­cel­er­a­tion of sanc­tions to not only curb cor­rup­tion and pro­mote good gov­er­nance, but also to pre­vent forced labour and child labour in a company’s op­er­a­tion or sup­ply chain.</p>
    <p>These sanc­tions will likely ex­tend be­yond China, the tar­get un­der the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion which gets the most fo­cus.</p>
    <p>Forced labour and ex­ploita­tion of mi­grant workers will in par­tic­u­lar come un­der closer scru­tiny. Given that the IMF and the In­ter­na­tional Labour Or­gan­i­sa­tion have flagged hu­man traf­fick­ing as a mat­ter of con­cern in South-east Asia, par­tic­u­larly in sec­tors such as fish­ing and agri­cul­ture, com­pa­nies would need to look deeper into their sup­ply chains, lest they lose a key sup­plier due to sanc­tions, be­yond it be­ing the right thing for them to do.</p>
    <p>Be­yond sanc­tions, Pres­i­dent-elect Bi­den has an­nounced his in­ten­tion to host a global sum­mit for democ­racy to se­cure com­mit­ments in ad­vanc­ing hu­man rights and de­fend­ing against au­thor­i­tar­i­an­ism. This shift could im­pact busi­ness op­er­a­tions in coun­tries such as Cam­bo­dia and Myan­mar.</p>
    <p>TRADE MOVES FOR­WARD IN ASIA WITH­OUT THE U.S.</p>
    <p>Much as Mr Bi­den wishes to re­build re­la­tion­ships and re­store US lead­er­ship, it won’t be easy. In the four years since he served as vice-pres­i­dent, the US re­lin­quished its lead­ing role on form­ing a re­gional trade ar­chi­tec­ture for the 21st cen­tury.</p>
    <p>Now, the lead­er­ship on trade comes within Asia it­self. With­out the US, the Com­pre­hen­sive and</p>
    <p>Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (CPTPP) went into ef­fect. This month, 15 coun­tries signed the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP).</p>
    <p>Hav­ing two pluri­lat­eral trade agree­ments with­out US lead­er­ship would have been un­think­able pre-Trump.</p>
    <p>Through the RCEP, China re­in­forces its im­age of em­brac­ing open markets and glob­al­i­sa­tion, though those that deal with China know a more com­pli­cated re­al­ity.</p>
    <p>The US should be set­ting trade rules “in­stead of hav­ing China and oth­ers dic­tate out­comes be­cause they are the only game in town”, Mr Bi­den said at a re­cent news con­fer­ence in Delaware fol­low­ing a brief­ing with eco­nomic ad­vis­ers.</p>
    <p>But just be­cause the in­com­ing pres­i­dent be­lieves in a rules-based, mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing sys­tem does not mean the US will again be able to dic­tate the rules on trade. It will now be a col­lec­tive ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>As for­mer Sin­ga­pore am­bas­sador to the US and cur­rent Am­bas­sador-at-large Chan Heng Chee ex­plained to me, Mr Bi­den will be deal­ing with a dif­fer­ent</p>
    <p>Asia on his re­turn to Asia.</p>
    <p>“Small states and mid­dle power states have a sense of agency in the re­gion hav­ing worked out so many ini­tia­tives, es­pe­cially in the last four years and during the pandemic,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Wendy Cut­ler, the for­mer act­ing deputy US trade rep­re­sen­ta­tive and cur­rent vice-pres­i­dent of the Asia So­ci­ety Pol­icy In­sti­tute, made sim­i­lar points when asked about what awaits Mr Bi­den in the new Asia. “US re-en­gage­ment in Asia will re­quire recog­ni­tion and ap­pre­ci­a­tion of, and re­spect for, these changes be­fore the United States puts new ideas and ini­tia­tives on the table.”</p>
    <p>While busi­ness and gov­ern­ment lead­ers can breathe eas­ier with a re­turn to a sem­blance of nor­malcy and con­sis­tency from US lead­er­ship, the dam­age in­flicted by Mr Trump to the long­stand­ing en­gage­ment frame­work will not be im­me­di­ately un­done.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther, given the con­tin­u­ing po­lit­i­cal di­vide in US do­mes­tic pol­i­tics, there will be no snap-back to US lead­er­ship on trade in the re­gion on the fear that Mr Trump, an­other Trump, or one of Mr Trump’s acolytes, could be in the White House in 2024.</p>
    <p>The RCEP poses an ad­di­tional chal­lenge for the in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion as this agree­ment fur­ther dis­ad­van­tages US ex­ports to Asia while fur­ther deep­en­ing in­ter-re­gional trade.</p>
    <p>The sign­ing of RCEP could and should al­ter the trade de­bate in the US by re­fram­ing the CPTPP not just as a trade agree­ment which im­pacts US busi­nesses, workers and the en­vi­ron­ment, but also as a frame­work which pro­vides the US and like-minded coun­tries a way to com­pete with China by set­ting the rules for com­pe­ti­tion in the re­gion which re­quire a level play­ing field with state-owned en­ter­prises and take into ac­count labour and the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Even though the Pres­i­dent-elect and many of his ad­vis­ers recog­nise the com­pet­i­tive dis­ad­van­tage at which the US now finds it­self, no one should ex­pect the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion to im­me­di­ately turn back to the CPTPP, which would take a rene­go­ti­a­tion based on how much has changed in the past four years both po­lit­i­cally and tech­no­log­i­cally.</p>
    <p>While it re­mains un­clear if, how, and when the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will re-en­gage with the re­gion on trade, US-head­quar­tered busi­nesses can­not af­ford to wait for the trade dy­namic in Washington to change. Com­pa­nies op­er­at­ing within the 15-mem­ber bloc can and should take ad­van­tage of RCEP’s ben­e­fits as the agree­ment ap­plies to those do­ing busi­ness within the re­gion, re­gard­less of whether their head­quar­ters are lo­cated in Mel­bourne, Aus­tralia, or Mel­bourne, Florida.</p>
    <p>No mat­ter who won the elec­tion, US busi­nesses op­er­at­ing in the re­gion would have con­tin­ued their fo­cus on Asia and taken ad­van­tage of both CPTPP and RCEP. Like­wise, US farm­ers and small and medium-sized en­ter­prises which op­er­ate only in the US and ex­port to the re­gion are dis­ad­van­taged re­gard­less of the out­come of the elec­tion as they are shut out of both trade agree­ments.</p>
    <p>Come Jan 20, busi­nesses will be deal­ing with a less hos­tile and tar­iff-happy US ad­min­is­tra­tion. Some tar­iffs, es­pe­cially those not im­posed on China, may come down, sooner rather than later.</p>
    <p>But some things won’t change in the short term, such as the US not jump­ing back into re­gional trade agree­ments. That said, busi­ness lead­ers have much they could do to take ad­van­tage of the op­por­tu­ni­ties the Bi­den shift pro­vides while mit­i­gat­ing against the com­ing chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Adapt­ing to cli­mate risk and in­cor­po­rat­ing sus­tain­abil­ity from an en­vi­ron­men­tal, social and gov­er­nance per­spec­tive into busi­ness op­er­a­tions will help com­pa­nies bet­ter prepare for what­ever may come from a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The great­est growth op­por­tu­ni­ties for many com­pa­nies take place in the Asia-Pa­cific and busi­nesses must be part of it, re­gard­less of who oc­cu­pies the White House. Those lead­ers that adapt their strate­gies to who does will find them­selves at a com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tage.</p>
