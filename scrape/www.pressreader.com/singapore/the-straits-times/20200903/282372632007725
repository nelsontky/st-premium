    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) This se­ries between the Den­ver Nuggets and the Utah Jazz will be re­mem­bered for the match-up between two of the best young guards in the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion, Dono­van Mitchell and Ja­mal Mur­ray.</p>
    <p>Utah’s Mitchell twice scored at least 50 points. So too did Mur­ray as they joined an elite group com­pris­ing Michael Jor­dan and Allen Iver­son as the only play­ers to have done so in a post-sea­son se­ries.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther could be sep­a­rated, nor could their teams, with the open­ing round of the West­ern Con­fer­ence play-offs go­ing to a de­cid­ing Game 7 at Dis­ney World. But in the end, there can only be one win­ner and it was Mur­ray and the Nuggets who pre­vailed af­ter beat­ing the Jazz 80-78 on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Both play­ers were not at their cus­tom­ary best, ex­hausted af­ter giv­ing it their all. Mur­ray had 17 points, while Mitchell fared slightly bet­ter with a team-high 22 points. But at the end, the pair com­bined for 475 points – the most ever by an op­pos­ing duo in play-off se­ries his­tory, ac­cord­ing to ESPN Stats and Info.</p>
    <p>It was all too much for All-Star Mitchell, who col­lapsed onto the floor and broke down in tears af­ter the game. It was Canada’s Mur­ray, who in­stead broke out in a smile, af­ter the Nuggets be­came just the 12th team in league his­tory to come back from 3-1 down in a se­ries.</p>
    <p>All-Star Nikola Jo­kic came up big on the night with a game-high 30 points, and Den­ver coach Michael Malone was quick to pay trib­ute to his two best play­ers af­ter­wards.</p>
    <p>“We are not in a Game 7 with­out Ja­mal, but qui­etly, Nikola Jo­kic was hav­ing an out­stand­ing se­ries,” he told ESPN. “You knew they would take away Ja­mal Mur­ray. They tried to do dif­fer­ent things tonight, that was their ad­just­ment.</p>
    <p>“We were pre­pared for that. We knew they would try to get the ball out of his hands. That is when you need Nikola to step up.</p>
    <p>“With ev­ery­thing we were fac­ing, down 3-1, stop­page in play, are we go­ing to con­tinue, are we not, a lot of teams would have just given in.</p>
    <p>“Es­pe­cially when you con­sider we have been 57 days away from our fam­i­lies. Man, do we re­ally want to ex­tend our stay. And that is where the pride comes into play. Our play­ers, they wanted it.</p>
    <p>“That is the amaz­ing thing about this – three straight games of win or go home. The re­siliency, the men­tal tough­ness, and the want, the will to win was on full dis­play for ev­ery­one to see. Couldn’t be more proud of our guys.”</p>
    <p>Third-seeded Den­ver have pre­cious lit­tle time to rest, with their semi-fi­nal match-up with the sec­ond seeds, the Los An­ge­les Clip­pers, start­ing to­day.</p>
    <p>For Mitchell, though, the agony of be­ing so close yet so far “will be on my mind for a long time”.</p>
