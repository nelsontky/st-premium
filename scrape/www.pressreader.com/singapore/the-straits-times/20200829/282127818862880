    <p>A scheme that dis­burses one-time grants of $500 to hawk­ers who sign up to food de­liv­ery plat­forms or who en­gage third-party lo­gis­tics firms to de­liver food will be ex­tended to the end of the year.</p>
    <p>The fund started in April and was ini­tially due to end on June 30, but ap­pli­ca­tions have con­tin­ued to be ac­cepted.</p>
    <p>Cooked food stall­hold­ers op­er­at­ing at hawker cen­tres man­aged by the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) or by its ap­pointed op­er­a­tors are el­i­gi­ble for the scheme.</p>
    <p>Around 1,200 ap­pli­ca­tions have been ap­proved as at Aug 21, noted Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Sustainabi­lity and the En­vi­ron­ment Amy Khor yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive will al­le­vi­ate the con­cerns of hawk­ers who may be hes­i­tant about sub­scrib­ing to food de­liv­ery plat­forms, which can charge com­mis­sions rang­ing from about 25 per cent to 32 per cent for each or­der.</p>
    <p>Dr Khor, who was vis­it­ing the Life­long Learn­ing In­sti­tute, said the ex­ten­sion of the fund is in line with the Gov­ern­ment’s broad dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion ef­forts un­der the Hawk­ers Go Dig­i­tal scheme.</p>
    <p>She hopes it will help to pro­vide an al­ter­na­tive source of rev­enue for hawk­ers while em­pow­er­ing them to in­no­vate in their trade.</p>
    <p>Dr Khor also gave up­dates on the Hawk­ers’ Devel­op­ment Pro­gramme, a struc­tured ap­pren­tice­ship scheme for as­pir­ing hawk­ers</p>
    <p>that be­gan last month. The pro­gramme, jointly de­vel­oped by NEA and Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore, ex­pects to train at least 100 peo­ple over the next three years.</p>
    <p>It con­sists of three stages. Trainees ini­tially learn ba­sic food safety and hy­giene and how to pro­mote a busi­ness on so­cial me­dia and food de­liv­ery apps, among other things. They will then be ap­pren­ticed to ex­pe­ri­enced hawk­ers for two months.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal stage will al­low them to put their skills into prac­tice through the In­cu­ba­tion Stall Pro­gramme, which of­fers an av­er­age rental re­bate of 40 per cent for 15 months.</p>
    <p>They can also rent stalls re­leased through NEA’s monthly ten­der.</p>
    <p>More than 100 as­pir­ing hawk­ers have signed up for the pro­gramme, said Dr Khor, al­though only 40 per cent of them have em­barked on the sec­ond stage, which is the ap­pren­tice­ship. Forty ex­pe­ri­enced hawk­ers have come for­ward to guide them, she added.</p>
    <p>Min­i­mart op­er­a­tor Yong Jie Si­uen, 42, com­pleted the first stage of the pro­gramme this week.</p>
    <p>The lease for his shop in Changi Busi­ness Park, which saw busi­ness hit amid the pan­demic, ends this month, so he saw the pro­gramme as a chance to switch trades and pur­sue a ca­reer in the food and bev­er­age in­dus­try in­stead.</p>
    <p>He is un­de­terred by the po­ten­tial ob­sta­cles fac­ing the hawker trade amid the pan­demic. He said: “There is al­ways a risk in start­ing a busi­ness, but there are also new op­por­tu­ni­ties (that come with Covid-19).</p>
    <p>“For in­stance, peo­ple may have been re­sis­tant to or­der­ing food via de­liv­ery apps from hawk­ers in the past, but the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion has also caused some to change their mind­sets and see that hawker food can still taste good even when it is not eaten on the spot.”</p>
