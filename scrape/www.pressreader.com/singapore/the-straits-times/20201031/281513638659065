    <p>For some in Sin­ga­pore, road trips to Malaysia are reg­u­lar af­fairs.</p>
    <p>The easy ac­cess to places like Malacca and Kuala Lumpur, a three and four hours’ drive re­spec­tively from the Wood­lands Cause­way, pro­vides af­ford­able hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>The 110kmh speed limit on most stretches of Malaysia’s North-South High­way, and scenic roads like the Tereng­ganu coastal high­way, also al­low keen drivers and bik­ers to stretch the per­for­mance of their ve­hi­cles, within le­gal lim­its, while ex­plor­ing new places.</p>
    <p>But the Covid-19 pan­demic has put the brakes on road trips north.</p>
    <p>So The Straits Times took the road less trav­elled – a 200km drive around Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In this guide, the trip we took – in a Mini Con­vert­ible – is di­vided into four parts, which can be com­pleted separately or in a day.</p>
    <p>Start­ing at the Seah Im carpark near VivoCity, mo­torists can jour­ney to the west, to the Jurong in­dus­trial es­tate, and then to Kranji in the north.</p>
    <p>The route skirts the perime­ter of the cen­tral catch­ment area be­fore head­ing east to Pung­gol and Changi. The drive ends at Mount Faber.</p>
    <p>MORN­ING DRIVE (77KM) – IN­DUS­TRIAL JURONG AND THE SCENIC KRANJI COUN­TRY­SIDE</p>
    <p>The first stop is South Buona Vista Road, which is known for its wind­ing turns.</p>
    <p>Al­though the road is re­ferred to as “99 turns”, it is an ex­ag­ger­a­tion as there are only 11 turns.</p>
    <p>For his­tory buffs, there is a his­tor­i­cal marker in Kent Ridge Park off South Buona Vista Road worth stop­ping for.</p>
    <p>It de­scribes the epic bat­tle in Pasir Pan­jang dur­ing World War II, where Lieu­tenant Ad­nan Saidi and the Malay Reg­i­ment fought the Ja­panese in­vaders from Feb 13 to 14, 1942. The na­tional hero died as a re­sult of the fight.</p>
    <p>From South Buona Vista Road, the route takes drivers through the Jurong in­dus­trial es­tate, which has pow­ered Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic growth since in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>The high­light of the drive is the con­struc­tion site of Tuas Mega Port. When com­pleted in 2040, it will be the world’s largest fully au­to­mated ter­mi­nal.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Tuas, the next stop is the “40 lamp posts”, or Lim Chu Kang Road, which is Sin­ga­pore’s “spare run­way”.</p>
    <p>The road is flanked by the Lim Chu Kang ceme­ter­ies and Ten­gah Air­base. Since 1986, the Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Air Force has turned it into a tem­po­rary air­craft run­way seven times for fighter jets to take off and land. The long and wide road is favoured by street rac­ers for il­le­gal car and mo­tor­bike races.</p>
    <p>The next stop is Jalan Bahtera, pos­si­bly Sin­ga­pore’s last un­paved and un­lit road. It leads to the Sarim­bun beach, where the first wave of Ja­panese sol­diers landed on Feb 8, 1942, mark­ing the start of the World War II bat­tle for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The route also cov­ers the Lim Chu Kang and Kranji ar­eas which are set to be trans­formed into Sin­ga­pore’s food bowl, as the coun­try ramps up its drive to pro­duce more food lo­cally as a buf­fer against global sup­ply shocks. Some 390ha of land will be re­de­vel­oped un­der a mas­ter­plan to cre­ate a high-tech agri-food clus­ter.</p>
    <p>The lunch stop is Bol­ly­wood Veg­gies, one of a hand­ful of farm-themed eater­ies in the Kranji area. It is fa­mous for its nasi lemak and dessert.</p>
    <p>In­sider tip: There is no pub­lic toi­let along this 77km route.</p>
    <p>EARLY AF­TER­NOON DRIVE (56KM) – EX­PLOR­ING THE CEN­TRAL CATCH­MENT AREA</p>
    <p>The three stops in this seg­ment are at the fringes of the cen­tral catch­ment area, with at­trac­tions that will ap­peal to na­ture and his­tory buffs.</p>
    <p>The first stop is Ri­fle Range Road, which peels off from Dun­earn Road. It is fre­quented by those vis­it­ing the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces (SAF) of­fi­cers’ club, other­wise known as Te­masek Club.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the club, the road cuts into the Bukit Timah Na­ture Re­serve, one of the few pub­lic roads in­side the re­serve.</p>
    <p>Across the other end of the cen­tral catch­ment area from Ri­fle Range Road is Old Up­per Thomson Road.</p>
    <p>Grand Prix drivers raced on this road be­tween 1961 and 1973. It was where the Malaysian Grand Prix and Sin­ga­pore Grand Prix were held. A 3km stretch of Old Up­per Thomson Road is now a one-way street to ac­com­mo­date a park con­nec­tor.</p>
    <p>In­sider tip: Slow down at this stretch. The Grand Prix cir­cuit claimed the lives of seven rac­ers over 11 years the races were held there.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary 2008, a Mit­subishi Lancer ca­reened off the road when ap­proach­ing the Devil’s Bend – a sharp 300-de­gree hair­pin turn – and slammed into a wall of trees, caus­ing the death of two pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>The third stop is the rocket tower and the fa­mous ca­sua­r­ina tree at Up­per Sele­tar Reser­voir. It is an op­por­tu­nity to take a photo or selfie at one of Sin­ga­pore’s most In­sta­grammed trees.</p>
    <p>LATE AF­TER­NOON DRIVE (39KM) – EX­PLOR­ING TWO QUIRKY SPOTS</p>
    <p>This seg­ment ex­plores two quirky land­marks.</p>
    <p>The first, a cof­fee break at the Soek Seng 1954 Bi­cy­cle Cafe, which is hid­den in the Sele­tar Aero­space Park. Din­ers can get a view of the Sele­tar Air­port run­way and parked planes, in­clud­ing pri­vate jets.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond stop is the “UFOs” in Tampines Road. The “UFOs” or “gi­ant spin­ning tops” are stor­age tanks to hold Ne­wa­ter, which is wa­ter re­cy­cled from waste and treated to drink­ing qual­ity.</p>
    <p>In­sider tip: There is no carpark near the “UFOs”, so look out for a runoff area op­po­site the Tian Teck Keng tem­ple to park and take pho­tos. The stretch of road hosts sev­eral large tem­ples and a funeral par­lour.</p>
    <p>NIGHT DRIVE (23KM) – NIGHT DRIVE THROUGH THE CITY</p>
    <p>The din­ner stop is along Changi Coastal Walk, in the Belly View Cafe in the Na­tional Ser­vice Re­sort and Coun­try Club. Din­ers can check out the flight paths of planes land­ing and tak­ing off from Changi Air­port, and soak in views of the sun set­ting over the hori­zon.</p>
    <p>The eatery serves af­ford­able lo­cal zi char dishes such as fried rice and prawn-paste chicken. It is not the best zi char in Sin­ga­pore, but it is def­i­nitely the zi char with one of the best views.</p>
    <p>Af­ter din­ner, the route takes drivers to Sheares Bridge for a view of the Ma­rina Bay sky­line, Sin­ga­pore Flyer, Ma­rina Bay Sands, Bay East Gar­den and the Su­pertrees of Gar­dens by the Bay.</p>
    <p>The drive con­tin­ues through ma­jor Shen­ton Way land­marks like the Ma­rina Bay Fi­nan­cial Cen­tre, Lau Pa Sat and Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) Build­ing, and Kep­pel Road land­marks like the for­mer Tan­jong Pa­gar Rail­way Sta­tion.</p>
    <p>The jour­ney ends at Mount Faber, which is near Seah Im carpark where it all started.</p>
    <p>In­sider tip: Head to carpark B for the best view of Sen­tosa. Park­ing is free.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary 2003, then Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad made a quip di­rected at Sin­ga­pore drivers: “If you like, drive on our roads, which are quite long, in Fer­raris – they have Fer­raris, you know – be­cause in Sin­ga­pore you can’t drive very far.”</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore’s roads may not be as long and as var­ied as Malaysia’s, there are still am­ple routes to keep both keen and ca­sual trav­ellers in gear, and lit­tle known out-of-the-way places to en­ter­tain ex­plor­ers.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>• The 1km-long Bahtera track is pos­si­bly Sin­ga­pore’s last un­paved and un­lit road.</p>
    <p>• The gravel track leads to Sarim­bun beach, which is the site of the first phase of the Ja­panese at­tack on Sin­ga­pore in Fe­bru­ary 1942 dur­ing World War II.</p>
    <p>6 Bol­ly­wood Veg­gies</p>
    <p>• The Neo Tiew area is Sin­ga­pore’s ru­ral coun­try­side.</p>
    <p>• Some of the farms in the area have banded to­gether to pro­mote lo­cal pro­duce such as eggs and veg­eta­bles. • Bol­ly­wood Veg­gies, the lunch stop, is one of the hand­ful of farm-themed cafes in the area.</p>
    <p>It is fa­mous for its nasi lemak (left).</p>
    <p>Af­ter fill­ing your stom­ach with good food, time to hit the road again. We are head­ing east now. 23</p>
