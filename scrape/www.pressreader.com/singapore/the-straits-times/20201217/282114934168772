    <p>An SBS bus pas­sen­ger flew into a rage and re­peat­edly punched the driver who had told him to wear a mask.</p>
    <p>Ja’afally Ab­dul Rahim, 53, was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to 16 weeks’ jail for as­sault­ing bus cap­tain Low Kok Weng, 39.</p>
    <p>The job­less Sin­ga­porean, who ap­peared in a district court via video link, was also fined $1,000 for fail­ing to wear a mask – an of­fence un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act.</p>
    <p>Mr Low, who is a Malaysian, was driv­ing an SBS ser­vice 21 bus along Pasir Ris Drive 1 around 2.45pm on Sept 15 when he pulled up at a bus stop. Ja’afally boarded the ve­hi­cle with­out wear­ing a mask.</p>
    <p>He be­came an­gry when Mr Low ad­vised him to don one.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor An­drew Low said: “The ac­cused be­came ag­i­tated and went to the front of the bus to con­front the vic­tim... The vic­tim tried to calm the ac­cused down but to no avail.</p>
    <p>“The vic­tim de­cided to keep quiet and move off, while the ac­cused ranted and pointed ag­gres­sively at the vic­tim.”</p>
    <p>Ja’afally con­tin­ued to be­rate the driver and shoved his shoul­ders.</p>
    <p>Un­able to con­tinue with the jour­ney, Mr Low opened the bus doors for pas­sen­gers to alight around 2.55pm. Ja’afally then took the driver’s sun­glasses and flung them on the floor.</p>
    <p>The DPP told District J udge Christo­pher Goh: “The ac­cused then con­tin­ued to con­front the vic­tim, who re­mained quiet all this while. At about 2.58pm, the ac­cused grabbed the vic­tim’s vest near to his neck and con­tin­ued be­hav­ing ag­gres­sively to­wards the vic­tim.</p>
    <p>“The vic­tim tried to re­sist and man­aged to pull away the ac­cused’s left hand that was hold­ing onto the vic­tim’s vest... The ac­cused punched the vic­tim mul­ti­ple times in his face and the back of his head.”</p>
    <p>The court heard that Ja’afally stopped at­tack­ing the driver only when wit­nesses in­ter­vened.</p>
    <p>They got him out of the bus and re­strained him un­til po­lice ar­rived at the scene. An am­bu­lance took Mr Low to Changi Gen­eral Hospi­tal and he was given three days of out­pa­tient med­i­cal leave.</p>
    <p>For as­sault, Ja’afally could have been jailed for up to three years and fined up to $5,000.</p>
