    <p>DOHA • Qatar said yes­ter­day that those re­spon­si­ble for in­va­sive gy­nae­co­log­i­cal searches of pas­sen­gers at Doha air­port had been re­ferred for pros­e­cu­tion over the vi­o­la­tions fol­low­ing wide­spread out­rage.</p>
    <p>Women on 10 Qatar Air­ways flights out of Doha were sub­ject to the ex­am­i­na­tions as the au­thor­i­ties searched for the mother of a new­born baby found aban­doned in an air­port bath­room on Oct 2.</p>
    <p>“Those re­spon­si­ble for th­ese vi­o­la­tions and il­le­gal ac­tions have been re­ferred to the Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tion Of­fice,” the govern­ment said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“The Prime Min­is­ter and Min­is­ter of In­te­rior ex­pressed the govern­ment of the state of Qatar’s sin­cer­est apol­ogy for what some fe­male trav­ellers went through as a re­sult of the mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent has caused di­plo­matic ten­sions with three friendly na­tions – Aus­tralia, Bri­tain and New Zealand – which in­ten­si­fied when the au­thor­i­ties ini­tially de­clined to apol­o­gise, lead­ing to an on­line back­lash against the air­line, one of the wealthy Gulf na­tion’s pres­tige projects.</p>
    <p>New Zealand was the lat­est to raise con­cerns, say­ing late on Thurs­day that one of its cit­i­zens was among the women sub­jected to the in­va­sive ex­am­i­na­tions.</p>
    <p>“We were ex­tremely con­cerned to learn... that a New Zealand na­tional was in­volved in the ap­palling in­ci­dent in­volv­ing fe­male pas­sen­gers on sev­eral Qatar Air­ways flights,” its for­eign min­istry said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>It la­belled the ac­tion “com­pletely un­ac­cept­able”.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent came to light only this week af­ter af­fected Aus­tralian pas­sen­gers spoke out.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has since said 13 of its cit­i­zens had to en­dure the “ap­palling” ex­am­i­na­tions; Bri­tain said it is pro­vid­ing sup­port for two women; and Agence FrancePres­se has learnt that a French woman was also af­fected.</p>
    <p>Qatar said the baby girl – who sur­vived – was wrapped in plas­tic and left to die in a bath­room rub­bish bin, prompt­ing what sources said was a lock­down of Ha­mad In­ter­na­tional Air­port.</p>
    <p>Women were then led from air­craft to am­bu­lances on the tar­mac, where they were sub­jected to in­va­sive ex­am­i­na­tions to see if they had re­cently given birth.</p>
    <p>Mr Wolf­gang Babeck, a pas­sen­ger on one of the af­fected flights, a Qatar Air­ways ser­vice to Syd­ney, said the women who were sub­jected to the searches were “shell­shocked” af­ter their or­deals.</p>
    <p>Qatar is an ul­tra-con­ser­va­tive Mus­lim monar­chy, where sex and child­birth out­side of mar­riage are pun­ish­able by jail.</p>
    <p>Qatar said yes­ter­day that task forces were look­ing at “po­ten­tial gaps in the pro­ce­dures and pro­to­cols” at the air­port.</p>
