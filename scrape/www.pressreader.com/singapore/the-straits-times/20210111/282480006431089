    <p>• Scott McTom­i­nay (left) cel­e­brated cap­tain­ing Manch­ester United for the first time by scor­ing the only goal in a 1-0 FA Cup third-round vic­tory against Wat­ford on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer made nine changes from his pre­vi­ous game and that left the hosts look­ing a lit­tle dis­or­gan­ised at the start.</p>
    <p>How­ever, McTom­i­nay was one of the few re­tained and the Scot­land mid­fielder headed the win­ner just five min­utes in.</p>
    <p>Wat­ford, who are sixth in the sec­ond-tier Cham­pi­onship after be­ing rel­e­gated from the Premier League last sea­son, dom­i­nated the last 15 min­utes of the first half at Old Traf­ford but strug­gled to get de­cent shots on tar­get.</p>
    <p>United looked to counter-at­tack but de­spite giv­ing game time to Juan Mata and Donny van de Beek – both have spent much of the sea­son on the bench – and grant­ing Jesse Lin­gard only his sec­ond start of the term, Ma­son Green­wood had few chances to work with up front.</p>
    <p>In­stead, it was 24-year-old McTom­i­nay who led the way with a self­less dis­play of running and tack­ling to en­sure that Sol­sk­jaer’s side made it through to to­day’s fourth-round draw.</p>
    <p>On wear­ing the arm­band, the academy grad­u­ate said: “When the man­ager told me, it was a sur­real mo­ment. I’ve been here since I had just turned five, so that’s 18 or 19 years associated with the club and it is a huge honour.</p>
    <p>“I love this club and it has been my whole life. We started re­ally well and then for the first half an hour we were re­ally good, moved the ball re­ally well and there was some good com­bi­na­tion play.”</p>
    <p>On McTom­i­nay, Sol­sk­jaer said: “He’s got great char­ac­ter, good at­ti­tude. He comes in ev­ery day, does the right things, lives his life prop­erly, wants to be the best he can be and he’s not afraid to be vo­cal.</p>
    <p>“He al­ways, al­ways goes out there to give his best. Never shirks a tackle. Noth­ing. He’s got ev­ery­thing a leader has to have, so I just wanted to test him to­day.”</p>
    <p>The Nor­we­gian also ad­mit­ted that de­spite his fringe play­ers fail­ing to im­press, likely mean­ing they will not be part of his first XI when they travel to Burn­ley to­mor­row, he in­sisted that the likes of Mata and van de Beek would “ben­e­fit from this as well”.</p>
    <p>“Very happy to get through,” he added. “We started very brightly. But after a very good start we lost our shape, we lost too many balls.</p>
    <p>“It was like we started mak­ing dif­fi­cult de­ci­sions to try and com­pli­cate things and maybe show the man­ager that, ‘I want to play in the next game’. But we’re through. That’s the main thing.”</p>
    <p>United will go top of the Premier League to­mor­row if they avoid de­feat at Burn­ley.</p>
