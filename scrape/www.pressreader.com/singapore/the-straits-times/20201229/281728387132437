    <p>Many in In­dia have re­sorted to con­sum­ing more honey to boost their im­mu­nity amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, but an adul­ter­ation scan­dal, widely dubbed Honey­gate, has left a bit­ter af­ter­taste.</p>
    <p>This after the Cen­tre for Science and En­vi­ron­ment (CSE), a Delhi-based pub­lic in­ter­est re­search and ad­vo­cacy or­gan­i­sa­tion, re­vealed ear­lier this month that many of the coun­try’s top honey brands were adul­ter­ated with mod­i­fied su­gar syrup de­signed to beat tests pre­scribed by the In­dian food safety au­thor­i­ties to de­tect im­pure honey.</p>
    <p>Voices are now grow­ing within the gov­ern­ment, as well as among those as­so­ci­ated with honey pro­duc­tion, call­ing for re­stric­tions on the im­port of fruc­tose syrup from China that is used as a key adul­ter­ant in the In­dian honey in­dus­try and was the fo­cus of CSE’s in­ves­ti­ga­tion over sev­eral months.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a Dec 17 re­port in The Times of In­dia, Min­is­ter for Mi­cro, Small and Medium En­ter­prises Nitin Gad­kari wrote to Com­merce and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Piyush Goyal ask­ing for re­stric­tions on the im­port of fruc­tose syrup, in­clud­ing through a steep in­crease in im­port duty.</p>
    <p>The Khadi and Vil­lage In­dus­tries Com­mis­sion, a gov­ern­ment body that pro­motes api­cul­ture, has even called for a ban on the im­port of fruc­tose syrup, much of which is sourced from China.</p>
    <p>Mr Tarun Hal­dar, gen­eral sec­re­tary of the West Ben­gal Bee­keep­ers’ As­so­ci­a­tion, echoed this de­mand. “If this con­tin­ues, cus­tomers will lose their trust in honey,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Cen­tral Con­sumer Pro­tec­tion Author­ity has, mean­while, asked the Food Safety and Stan­dards Author­ity of In­dia (FSSAI) to in­quire into the adul­ter­ation claim and has ex­tended its co­op­er­a­tion for such an in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>The CSE had tested 22 bot­tles of honey – cov­er­ing as many as 13 brands – and found that while many cleared tests man­dated in In­dia, only five of the bot­tled sam­ples passed the nu­clear mag­netic res­o­nance (NMR) test con­ducted at a lab­o­ra­tory in Ger­many.</p>
    <p>The NMR is an ad­vanced test that can de­tect adul­ter­ation with mod­i­fied su­gar syrups. The test is cur­rently manda­tory for honey ex­ported from In­dia, but not for honey con­sumed do­mes­ti­cally.</p>
    <p>The in­ves­ti­ga­tion was sparked by re­ports from bee­keep­ers who said prices of raw honey had crashed since 2015 de­spite an in­crease in honey sales, which had ren­dered their busi­ness un­vi­able.</p>
    <p>Mr Lal Ba­hadur Bha­tia, a bee­keeper who pro­duces honey at var­i­ous locations in north In­dia, told The Straits Times that rates for his raw honey had fallen from as much as 150 ru­pees (S$2.70) a kilo­gram in 2015 to around 65 ru­pees last year, while the cost of pro­duc­tion went up from 40 ru­pees to 60 ru­pees in the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“How do you ex­pect us to sur­vive?” he asked.</p>
    <p>While bee­keep­ers like Mr Bha­tia said they had lit­tle idea what hap­pens to the raw honey they sell, many producers com­plained to the CSE that they sus­pected com­pa­nies were mix­ing cheaper su­gar syrups with pure honey to cap­i­talise on in­creased de­mand and drive up their prof­its.</p>
    <p>The team at CSE then stum­bled on an im­por­tant lead – In­dia has seen a sig­nif­i­cant in­crease in fruc­tose syrup im­ports since 2014 to 2015, with more than 10,000 met­ric tonnes im­ported ev­ery year, a sharp jump from less than 2,500 met­ric tonnes in 2012 to 2013. About 95 per cent of this syrup comes from China.</p>
    <p>Go­ing un­der­cover, the CSE pur­chased fruc­tose syrup from some Chi­nese com­pa­nies ad­ver­tis­ing their prod­ucts on trade por­tals such as Alibaba. The CSE was even told via e-mail by these com­pa­nies that their syrups would clear adul­ter­ation tests for honey con­sumed in In­dia.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tors from the CSE also found out that the know-how for pro­duc­ing this syrup had been sold to en­ti­ties in In­dia.</p>
    <p>The in­ves­ti­ga­tors pro­cured this “all pass” syrup from one such fac­tory in the state of Ut­tarak­hand. The Chi­nese and In­dian syrups were then mixed with pure honey, and these adul­ter­ated sam­ples were tested for key adul­ter­ation pa­ram­e­ters set by FSSAI.</p>
    <p>Sam­ples with syrup con­tent as high as 50 per cent cleared these tests.</p>
    <p>While there have been de­mands to make the NMR test com­pul­sory for honey that is sold and con­sumed in In­dia, Mr Amit Khu­rana, pro­gramme direc­tor for food safety and tox­ins at the CSE, told ST that the NMR test is not a per­ma­nent so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>“The way the busi­ness of honey adul­ter­ation is mov­ing, it is likely that there would be syrups that can soon (pass) NMR tests also,” he said.</p>
    <p>The CSE has rec­om­mended im­port re­stric­tions on fruc­tose syrup from China, which is used le­git­i­mately in the con­fec­tionery in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Call­ing for a multi-pronged ap­proach, Mr Khu­rana said the fo­cus should also be on trace­abil­ity and au­dits that can check honey adul­ter­ation at the source.</p>
    <p>“The cen­tral food reg­u­la­tor has to take... ac­tion through inspection­s and au­dits to iden­tify where and how much of this syrup is pro­duced, to whom it is be­ing sold and for what end use,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I cer­tainly think this is some­thing that can be done. It is not as if there are hun­dreds of these en­ti­ties (en­gaged in the pro­duc­tion and im­port of this syrup).”</p>
