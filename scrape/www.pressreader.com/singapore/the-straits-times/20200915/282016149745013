    <p>As a mem­ber of the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces Vol­un­teer Corps, Ms Samantha Ng was fi­nally able to un­lock the coded talk of her male peers who have done na­tional ser­vice (NS).</p>
    <p>“Pre­vi­ously, when­ever the guys talked about na­tional ser­vice, I couldn’t un­der­stand any­thing. Join­ing the corps helped me to break the code,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Ng, 31, a youth leader at the Na­tional Youth Coun­cil’s In­spirit com­mu­nity of young adult lead­ers, said her ex­pe­ri­ence changed the way she saw her male coun­ter­parts.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, she was one of 22 new mem­bers ap­pointed to a two-year term on the Ad­vi­sory Coun­cil on Com­mu­nity Re­la­tions in De­fence (Ac­cord) in a vir­tual cer­e­mony. Ms Ng is one of 23 women in Ac­cord, which has 26 mem­bers on its main coun­cil.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for De­fence Zaqy Mo­hamad, who is the co-chair­man of Ac­cord, said: “It is im­por­tant that we en­gage the women in our com­mu­nity to en­gen­der greater sup­port for NS and de­fence, as they play a very im­por­tant role in sup­port­ing our na­tional ser­vice­men, whether it is as an em­ployer, a wife, a mother, a col­league or a friend.”</p>
    <p>The cer­e­mony was at­tended by Mr Zaqy and Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for De­fence Heng Chee How, who is the other co-chair­man of Ac­cord.</p>
    <p>Other new mem­bers ap­pointed yes­ter­day in­clude Mr Chan­dra Mo­han, 58, the vicechair­man of the Sin­ga­pore In­dian Cham­ber of Com­merce and In­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Mrs Sher-li Tor­rey, 44, who is the founder and di­rec­tor of ca­reer por­tal Mums@Work, and a speaker on WomenTalk TV, was also among those reap­pointed to Ac­cord.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan­dra, who will be on Ac­cord’s Em­ployer and Busi­ness Coun­cil, said he hopes to im­prove in­tern­ship op­por­tu­ni­ties for full-time na­tional ser­vice­men (NSFs) and op­er­a­tional­lyready na­tional ser­vice­men.</p>
    <p>He also plans to or­gan­ise more ca­reer fairs for NSFs, to help them pre­pare them for employment.</p>
    <p>Mrs Tor­rey, who or­gan­ised the first NS we­bi­nar for moth­ers dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, said she hopes to con­duct more such vir­tual events in her new term.</p>
    <p>Es­tab­lished in 1984, Ac­cord is a plat­form to reach out to em­ploy­ers, busi­nesses, fam­i­lies, com­mu­ni­ties and ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions to in­crease sup­port for NS and To­tal De­fence.</p>
    <p>Prom­i­nent mem­bers of the Ac­cord main coun­cil in­clude Sengkang GRC MP He Ting Ru from the Work­ers’ Party, as well as Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion chief ex­ec­u­tive Ho Meng Kit and Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore pres­i­dent Tan Eng Chye.</p>
