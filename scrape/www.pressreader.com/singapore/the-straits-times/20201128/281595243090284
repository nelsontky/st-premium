    <p>As­traZeneca’s Covid-19 vac­cine looks like it is headed for an ad­di­tional global trial as the drug­maker tries to clear up un­cer­tainty and con­fu­sion sur­round­ing favourable re­sults in its cur­rent study. It wants the new test to con­firm the 90 per cent efficacy rate that the shot showed in a por­tion of an ex­ist­ing trial.</p>
    <p>AD­DI­TIONAL STUDY NEEDED</p>
    <p>Peo­ple call it a mis­take – it’s not a mis­take. Now that we’ve found what looks like a bet­ter efficacy, we have to val­i­date this, so we need to do an ad­di­tional study.</p>
    <p>DR PAS­CAL SO­RIOT, As­traZeneca chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca’s Covid-19 vac­cine looks headed for an ad­di­tional global trial as the drug­maker tries to clear up un­cer­tainty and con­fu­sion sur­round­ing favourable re­sults in its cur­rent study.</p>
    <p>The com­pany wants the new test to con­firm the 90 per cent efficacy rate that the shot showed in a por­tion of an ex­ist­ing trial, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Pas­cal So­riot said. It is favour­ing that op­tion rather than adding an arm to a sep­a­rate study that’s al­ready un­der way in the United States.</p>
    <p>Ques­tions are mount­ing over one of the fastest-mov­ing shots after the com­pany ac­knowl­edged that a lower dosage level that ap­peared more ef­fec­tive re­sulted from a manufactur­ing dis­crep­ancy.</p>
    <p>A day after the data was un­veiled, the head of Op­er­a­tion</p>
    <p>Warp Speed, the US vac­cine pro­gramme, said that the reg­i­men show­ing the higher level of ef­fec­tive­ness was tested in a younger pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>He also said the half-dose was given to some peo­ple be­cause of an error in the quan­tity of vac­cine put into some vials. None of those de­tails were dis­closed in As­tra or Ox­ford’s orig­i­nal state­ments.</p>
    <p>Dr So­riot dis­puted the idea that the half-dose reg­i­men was an error, say­ing that after re­searchers re­alised the dos­ing dis­crep­ancy, they for­mally changed the trial pro­to­col with the bless­ing of reg­u­la­tors. “I won’t tell you we ex­pected the efficacy to be higher,” said Dr So­riot. But “peo­ple call it a mis­take – it’s not a mis­take”.</p>
    <p>“Now that we’ve found what looks like a bet­ter efficacy, we</p>
    <p>have to val­i­date this, so we need to do an ad­di­tional study,” Dr So­riot said in his first in­ter­view since the data was re­leased. He said he didn’t ex­pect the ad­di­tional trial to hold up reg­u­la­tory ap­provals in the UK and Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s Health Sec­re­tary Matt Han­cock yes­ter­day asked the nation’s med­i­cal reg­u­la­tor to po­ten­tially by­pass its EU coun­ter­part and ap­prove the sup­ply of As­traZeneca’s vac­cine to speed its de­ploy­ment. Un­til the end of the year, when the UK ex­its a postBrexit tran­si­tion pe­riod, vac­cines must be au­tho­rised by the Euro­pean Medicines Agency.</p>
    <p>But Mr Han­cock said he in­voked a spe­cial rule al­low­ing Bri­tain’s reg­u­la­tor to au­tho­rise a tem­po­rary sup­ply of the vac­cine if the data is ro­bust enough.</p>
    <p>By speed­ing up the reg­u­la­tory ap­proval process, the UK hopes to be able to be­gin its mass vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme next month. The gov­ern­ment has pur­chased 100 mil</p>
    <p>lion doses of the shot in ad­vance, and es­ti­mates that four mil­lion of them will be avail­able by year-end.</p>
    <p>Clear­ance from the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion may take longer be­cause the reg­u­la­tor is un­likely to ap­prove the vac­cine on the ba­sis of stud­ies con­ducted else­where, es­pe­cially given the ques­tions over the re­sults, Dr So­riot said. Au­tho­ri­sa­tion in some coun­tries is still ex­pected be­fore the end of the year, he said.</p>
    <p>There’s added pres­sure on the As­tra shot to suc­ceed as it’s eas­ier to store and the firm is sell­ing it at cost dur­ing the pan­demic, which means many low- and middle-in­come coun­tries are re­ly­ing on it.</p>
    <p>De­vel­op­ers of the Sput­nik V Covid-19 vac­cine said on Thurs­day that As­traZeneca should try com­bin­ing its ex­per­i­men­tal shot with the Rus­sian one to boost efficacy.</p>
    <p>“If they go for a new clin­i­cal trial, we sug­gest try­ing a reg­i­men of com­bin­ing the AZ shot with the #Sput­nikV hu­man ade­n­ovi­ral vec­tor shot to boost efficacy,” the de­vel­op­ers of the Rus­sian vac­cine said on their Twit­ter ac­count.</p>
    <p>“Com­bin­ing vac­cines may prove im­por­tant for re­vac­ci­na­tions.”</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said on Thurs­day that de­liv­ery of the coro­n­avirus vac­cine would be­gin next week and the week after.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to US troops over­seas via video link to mark the Thanks­giv­ing hol­i­day, Mr Trump said the vac­cine would ini­tially be sent to front-line work­ers, med­i­cal per­son­nel and se­nior cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, sus­pected North Korean hack­ers have tried to break into the sys­tems of As­traZeneca in re­cent weeks, two peo­ple with knowl­edge of the mat­ter said.</p>
    <p>The hacking at­tempts tar­geted a “broad set of peo­ple”, in­clud­ing staff work­ing on Covid-19 re­search, said one of the sources, but are not thought to have been suc­cess­ful.</p>
