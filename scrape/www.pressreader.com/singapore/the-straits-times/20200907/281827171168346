    <p>Aus­tralia’s first Amer­i­can-style shop­ping mall opened in 1957 – a sprawl­ing, 26-store cen­tre in Bris­bane that at­tracted 15,000 peo­ple on its open­ing day.</p>
    <p>The phe­nom­e­non quickly spread across the coun­try, and there are now about 1,630 shop­ping cen­tres in Aus­tralia with some 65,000 stores. In 2018, ac­cord­ing to the Shop­ping Cen­tre Coun­cil of Aus­tralia, A$141 bil­lion (S$140 bil­lion) worth of sales were made through shop­ping cen­tres, equiv­a­lent to more than 7 per cent of the coun­try’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct.</p>
    <p>But the Covid-19 pan­demic is rais­ing ques­tions about the fu­ture of the malls and whether their ex­ist­ing op­er­at­ing model can sur­vive.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem is that many re­tail­ers in Aus­tralia are strug­gling to pay their agreed rents as foot traf­fic plunges.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor shop­ping malls gave stores rent relief but have de­manded nor­mal pay­ments as re­stric­tions eased. This has led to a se­ries of tense stand-offs that prompted some malls to close stores that re­fused to pay rents. In other cases, some ma­jor re­tail chains threat­ened to shut their stores un­less they re­ceived sig­nif­i­cant rent re­duc­tions.</p>
    <p>The chief ex­ec­u­tive of fash­ion re­tail chain Mo­saic Brands, Mr Scott Evans, last month threat­ened to close up to 500 stores at shop­ping malls. He said re­tail­ers were fac­ing a “new re­al­ity” in which cus­tomers are per­ma­nently shift­ing from buy­ing at brick-and-mor­tar stores to buy­ing on­line.</p>
    <p>“The re­tail rental mar­ket in Aus­tralia is not paused be­cause of the pan­demic – it is fun­da­men­tally changed for the fu­ture,” he said. “Shut­tered stores work for no one, so we aim to min­imise clo­sures, but not on un­com­mer­cial terms.”</p>
    <p>One of the high­est-pro­file clashes be­tween mall re­tail­ers and land­lords in­volved Premier In­vest­ments, which owns a se­ries of fash­ion chains. The com­pany re­port­edly re­fused to pay rent when its stores were closed dur­ing the ini­tial lock­downs im­posed across Aus­tralia in March. It has since in­sisted that its rents should be based on its sales turnover.</p>
    <p>But land­lords say such a move would threaten the vi­a­bil­ity of shop­ping cen­tres, which have large up­front costs and should not be re­spon­si­ble for at­tract­ing cus­tomers to in­di­vid­ual stores.</p>
    <p>Scen­tre Group, which op­er­ates West­field malls and is Aus­tralia’s big­gest shop­ping cen­tre land­lord, re­cently locked out 129 stores be­long­ing to Mo­saic and 38 be­long­ing to Strand­bags, a hand­bag and lug­gage chain. The move was seen as an at­tempt to warn other chains that it would not agree to on­go­ing rent relief. In late Au­gust, the chains’ stores re­port­edly re­opened af­ter they reached con­fi­den­tial agree­ments with Scen­tre.</p>
    <p>Scen­tre’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Peter Allen has in­sisted that rents must be fixed rather than linked to sales.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know where the mind­set comes from that a level of sales is a func­tion of rent,” Mr Allen told The Syd­ney Morn­ing Her­ald. “Re­tail­ers pay rent out of profit, they don’t pay rent out of sales.”</p>
    <p>Scen­tre last month re­ported a loss of A$3.6 bil­lion in the first half of the year. It col­lected just 48 per cent of rents from April to June amid lock­downs and as cus­tomers re­mained wary of re­turn­ing to malls.</p>
    <p>Grad­u­ally, shop­ping malls have largely re­turned to nor­mal as the pan­demic has come un­der con­trol. Aside from the state of Vic­to­ria, which has im­posed tight lock­downs to ad­dress a surge in Covid-19 cases, the rest of the coun­try is mostly op­er­at­ing as nor­mal.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia re­ported 76 new Covid-19 cases last Sat­ur­day, in­clud­ing 63 in Vic­to­ria and 10 in New South Wales.</p>
    <p>The ma­jor malls have re­ported that more than 90 per cent of stores – ex­clud­ing those in Vic­to­ria – are now open. But foot traf­fic is still down, as peo­ple re­main con­cerned about en­ter­ing large in­door spa­ces.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, the econ­omy is in the dol­drums with of­fi­cials re­port­ing last Wed­nes­day that the coun­try had fallen into a re­ces­sion – de­fined as two con­sec­u­tive quar­ters of neg­a­tive growth – for the first time since 1991.</p>
    <p>An ex­pert on re­tail his­tory, Dr Matthew Bai­ley from Mac­quarie Univer­sity, said shop­ping mall land­lords and ten­ants have long been locked in a con­test over benefits and costs. But the pan­demic is height­en­ing ten­sions and forc­ing land­lords to ask whether re­tail­ers are mov­ing to­wards a “per­ma­nently smaller phys­i­cal foot­print and greater in­vest­ment in on­line shopfronts”, he said.</p>
    <p>“When there is any sort of re­turn to nor­mal, both sides will en­ter fresh leas­ing ne­go­ti­a­tions with an acrid taste from what is rapidly be­com­ing their most vit­ri­olic fight to date,” he wrote on The Con­ver­sa­tion web­site.</p>
    <p>One of the high­est-pro­file clashes be­tween mall re­tail­ers and land­lords in­volved Premier In­vest­ments, which owns a se­ries of fash­ion chains. The com­pany re­port­edly re­fused to pay rent when its stores were closed dur­ing the ini­tial lock­downs im­posed across Aus­tralia in March.
