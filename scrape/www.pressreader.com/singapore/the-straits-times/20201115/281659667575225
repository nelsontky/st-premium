    <p>NO LOCK­DOWN, FOR NOW</p>
    <p>I will not go, this ad­min­is­tra­tion will not be go­ing to a lock­down. Hope­fully, the, the – uh – what­ever hap­pens in the fu­ture – who knows which ad­min­is­tra­tion will be. I guess time will tell.’’</p>
    <p>PRES­I­DENT DON­ALD TRUMP</p>
    <p>FACE THE FACTS</p>
    <p>I will not be pres­i­dent un­til next year.</p>
    <p>The cri­sis does not re­spect dates on the cal­en­dar; it is ac­cel­er­at­ing right now. Ur­gent ac­tion is needed to­day, now, by the cur­rent ad­min­is­tra­tion – start­ing with an ac­knowl­edge­ment of how se­ri­ous the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion is.’’</p>
    <p>PRES­I­DENT-ELECT JOE BI­DEN</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has in­sisted he would never put the United States into a coro­n­avirus lock­down, but said “time will tell” if an­other ad­min­is­tra­tion takes of­fice in Jan­uary and does so, the clos­est he has come to ac­knowl­edg­ing that Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den could suc­ceed him.</p>
    <p>In his first pub­lic re­marks since Mr Bi­den was widely pro­jected the win­ner on Nov 7, Mr Trump said he ex­pects a vac­cine to be avail­able for the en­tire pop­u­la­tion as soon as April, amid a crush of new in­fec­tions that has pushed daily case counts to record highs.</p>
    <p>In broad­cast re­marks in the White House Rose Gar­den on Friday, Mr Trump also ap­peared to ac­knowl­edge for the first time the pos­si­bil­ity of an up­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion, though he stopped short of con­ced­ing the race and did not men­tion his Demo­cratic ri­val by name.</p>
    <p>“Ideally, we won’t go to a lock­down. I will not go, this ad­min­is­tra­tion will not be go­ing to a lock­down,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully, the, the – uh – what­ever hap­pens in the fu­ture – who knows which ad­min­is­tra­tion will be. I guess time will tell.”</p>
    <p>Since the Nov 3 elec­tion, Mr Trump has per­sisted with un­founded ac­cu­sa­tions of wide­spread vot­ing fraud.</p>
    <p>But while he has con­tin­ued to make such claims on Twit­ter, he did not re­peat them in his pub­lic re­marks on Friday.</p>
    <p>At the Rose Gar­den, the Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent said he ex­pects an emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion for Pfizer’s vac­cine “ex­tremely soon”.</p>
    <p>Pfizer has said it ex­pects to re­port re­quired safety data this week and ap­ply for an emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The re­marks came after Mr Trump re­ceived an update on Oper­a­tion Warp Speed, an ad­min­is­tra­tion ef­fort to tur­bocharge de­vel­op­ment of a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Crit­i­cism of the ad­min­is­tra­tion’s re­sponse to the virus, which has killed more than 244,000 Amer­i­cans, be­came a ral­ly­ing cry for Democrats ahead of the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Less than an hour be­fore Mr Trump’s ad­dress, Mr Bi­den de­manded his pre­de­ces­sor do more to con­front the coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions ex­plod­ing across the coun­try, call­ing the fed­eral re­sponse “woe­fully lack­ing”.</p>
    <p>In a blis­ter­ing state­ment, Mr Bi­den said the re­cent surge, which is killing more than 1,000 Amer­i­cans and hos­pi­tal­is­ing al­most 70,000 ev­ery day, re­quired a “ro­bust and im­me­di­ate fed­eral re­sponse”.</p>
    <p>“I will not be pres­i­dent un­til next year,” Mr Bi­den said.</p>
    <p>“The cri­sis does not re­spect dates on the cal­en­dar; it is ac­cel­er­at­ing right now.</p>
    <p>“Ur­gent ac­tion is needed to­day, now, by the cur­rent ad­min­is­tra­tion – start­ing with an ac­knowl­edge­ment of how se­ri­ous the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion is.”</p>
    <p>The virus has re­port­edly even struck the US Se­cret Ser­vice, which guards Mr Trump, Mr Bi­den and the White House.</p>
    <p>The Wash­ing­ton Post said on Friday that more than 130 Se­cret Ser­vice agents were in­fected by the coro­n­avirus or in quar­an­tine due to con­tact with in­fected peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The out­break came after nu­mer­ous agents trav­elled to cam­paign ral­lies with Mr Trump where many of­fi­cials and most of the at­ten­dees did not wear masks.</p>
    <p>It also fol­lows sev­eral White House events in the past few weeks led by the Pres­i­dent, in­clud­ing an elec­tion night party on Nov 3, where most of those present also did away with masks.</p>
    <p>Af­ter­wards, a num­ber of of­fi­cials re­ported pos­i­tive Covid-19 tests, in­clud­ing Mr Trump’s chief of staff Mark Mead­ows.</p>
    <p>Asked about the re­ports, Se­cret Ser­vice spokesman Julie McMur­ray said it will not re­lease any de­tails on Covid-19 in­fec­tions “for pri­vacy and op­er­a­tional se­cu­rity rea­sons”.</p>
    <p>Separately, sup­port­ers of Mr Trump – who has made lit­tle head­way in the courts with his law­suits to over­turn Mr Bi­den’s vic­tory – took to the streets yes­ter­day in Wash­ing­ton to back his un­sub­stan­ti­ated claims of elec­tion fraud.</p>
    <p>Be­sides in Wash­ing­ton, proTrump demon­stra­tions in other cities were also sched­uled to fea­ture a mix of the Pres­i­dent’s back­ers, far-right per­son­al­i­ties and mem­bers of the Oath Keep­ers mili­tia and Proud Boys in a pub­lic dis­play of sup­port for his ef­fort to stay in power.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers have given the ral­lies var­i­ous names, in­clud­ing the Mil­lion Maga March, the March for Trump and Stop the Steal. Maga is an acro­nym for the Trump cam­paign slo­gan Make Amer­ica Great Again. Mr Trump has tweeted his sup­port.</p>
    <p>Some left-wing groups were also plan­ning counter-demon­stra­tions in Wash­ing­ton and other cities.</p>
