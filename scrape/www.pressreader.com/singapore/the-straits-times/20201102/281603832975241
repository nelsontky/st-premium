    <p>Sin­ga­pore is for­tu­nate that its re­li­gious teach­ers guide Mus­lims here to un­der­stand the true prin­ci­ples of Is­lam – to bring love and com­pas­sion – in the way they prac­tise the re­li­gion, said Min­is­ter-in-charge of Mus­lim Af­fairs Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli.</p>
    <p>Th­ese prin­ci­ples ap­ply in all facets of life, in­clud­ing re­act­ing to what­ever hap­pens around them in Sin­ga­pore and out­side Sin­ga­pore, he added yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Masa­gos, who is also Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment, was com­ment­ing on the re­cent at­tacks in France dur­ing an event to com­mem­o­rate the birth month of Prophet Muham­mad, held at Yu­sof Ishak Mosque in Wood­lands yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Two at­tacks in France in the last month have re­sulted in the coun­try rais­ing its se­cu­rity alert to the high­est level last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>On Oct 16, French mid­dle school teacher Sa­muel Paty was be­headed in Paris by an 18-year-old man of Chechen ori­gin who wanted to pun­ish the teacher for show­ing his pupils car­toons of Prophet Muham­mad in a civics class.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, a Tu­nisian man shout­ing “Al­lahu Ak­bar” (God is great­est) be­headed a woman and killed two oth­ers in a church in Nice be­fore be­ing shot and ar­rested by po­lice.</p>
    <p>Point­ing to the in­ci­dent in Paris, Mr Masa­gos said: “We have re­acted very mod­er­ately... led by our Mufti to teach us that as much as th­ese things are hap­pen­ing around us, (we must) be mea­sured in our re­sponse, be pa­tient, be lov­ing, have a lot of com­pas­sion, and un­der­stand that re­li­gion must come with all th­ese val­ues and not re­act vi­o­lently, even when peo­ple in­sti­gate it.”</p>
    <p>He added that in Sin­ga­pore, Mus­lims are able to re­act ra­tio­nally and give con­fi­dence to other com­mu­ni­ties that they re­spect one an­other.</p>
    <p>Mr Masa­gos said Sin­ga­pore Mus­lims can be an ex­em­plary mi­nor­ity Mus­lim com­mu­nity that is re­spected by oth­ers if they show re­silience and pa­tience.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore have de­nounced the at­tacks in France. A Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs spokesman said of the at­tacks in Nice: “There can be no jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for such at­tacks against in­no­cent civil­ians.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore has a zero-tol­er­ance pol­icy against all forms of vi­o­lence and ex­trem­ism.”</p>
    <p>Mufti Nazirudin Mohd Nasir, the high­est au­thor­ity on Is­lam in Sin­ga­pore, also con­demned last Fri­day the mur­ders in France.</p>
    <p>“Once again, rad­i­cal el­e­ments and ex­trem­ists have com­mit­ted heinous crimes on in­no­cent in­di­vid­u­als and in the most sa­cred of places,” he said in a let­ter to lead­ers of Sin­ga­pore’s Chris­tian com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“Such at­tacks are not only an af­front to the sa­cred­ness of the hu­man soul, but also an as­sault on Is­lam, as they took place in the month where Mus­lims com­mem­o­rate the birth of Prophet Muham­mad by hon­our­ing him with good deeds and be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese ter­ror­ists may have sought to ex­ploit our love for the Prophet to gain sym­pa­thy, but their ac­tions are a clear des­e­cra­tion of his teach­ings and have no place what­so­ever in Is­lam or in any re­li­gion.”</p>
    <p>There can be no jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for such at­tacks against in­no­cent civil­ians. Sin­ga­pore has a zero-tol­er­ance pol­icy against all forms of vi­o­lence and ex­trem­ism.</p>
    <p>A MIN­ISTRY OF FOR­EIGN AF­FAIRS SPOKESMAN</p>
    <p>AN AS­SAULT ON IS­LAM</p>
    <p>Such at­tacks are not only an af­front to the sa­cred­ness of the hu­man soul, but also an as­sault on Is­lam, as they took place in the month where Mus­lims com­mem­o­rate the birth of Prophet Muham­mad by hon­our­ing him with good deeds and be­hav­iour.</p>
