    <p>Chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer (CFO) Koh Ing Chin may hold the same job ti­tle he had in his pre­vi­ous com­pany, but his job scope is quite dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>His role at poul­try pro­ducer Kee Song Food Cor­po­ra­tion now de­mands more man­age­ment and lead­er­ship ca­pa­bil­i­ties, be­yond fi­nan­cial man­age­ment knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>When Mr Koh joined Kee Song in 2018, af­ter 18 years in his pre­vi­ous job in pre­ci­sion en­gi­neer­ing, the hu­man re­sources team at the food pro­ducer rec­om­mended that he reskill by at­tend­ing the pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­gramme for re­gional oper­a­tions man­ager.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh, 49, said the train­ing helped him un­der­stand the new in­dus­try faster. Some of the skills he picked up in­clude brand­ing and mar­ket­ing, and us­ing ap­proaches such as Six Sigma to im­prove oper­a­tions pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>“In to­day’s rapidly chang­ing busi­ness land­scape, the abil­ity to make quick and ef­fec­tive de­ci­sions is cru­cial... The role of a CFO has also evolved, and one must be able to look be­yond just fi­nance to play a piv­otal role in all aspects of the busi­ness,” he said.</p>
    <p>Kee Song em­ploys about 540 people in Singapore and Malaysia. It rears chick­ens and han­dles the pro­cess­ing, pack­ag­ing and dis­tri­bu­tion of fresh chilled and frozen poul­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh said he was in­ter­ested in food man­u­fac­tur­ing as the Singapore Govern­ment’s in­creas­ing em­pha­sis on food se­cu­rity and lo­cal food pro­duc­tion will cre­ate room for the sec­tor to grow fur­ther.</p>
    <p>The six-month con­ver­sion pro­gramme he went through in­volved full-time, struc­tured, on-the-job train­ing as well as a cus­tomised men­tor­ship pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>A trainer went to Mr Koh’s of­fice to con­duct one-to-one train­ing, and they ex­changed ideas and opin­ions on prac­ti­cal chal­lenges faced by the com­pany.</p>
    <p>Although this meant set­ting aside about one full day a month for train­ing, Mr Koh said he was able to sched­ule his work around it as he had at least one month’s ad­vance no­tice. He could also at­tend to ur­gent ad hoc work meet­ings on video calls, if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>He said he plans his own skills up­grad­ing as he knows the ar­eas that he needs to im­prove on which would be most ben­e­fi­cial to him and to the com­pany.</p>
    <p>As a char­tered ac­coun­tant, he is used to ful­fill­ing the re­quired con­tin­u­ing pro­fes­sional ed­u­ca­tion hours ev­ery year.</p>
    <p>The chal­lenges of at­tend­ing train­ing while hold­ing down a se­nior man­age­ment role have been man­age­able, he said. “The most im­por­tant step is to al­ways plan ahead, be com­mit­ted and make your­self fully avail­able for the en­tire train­ing to bet­ter ab­sorb the learn­ing and ap­ply it to the daily work.”</p>
