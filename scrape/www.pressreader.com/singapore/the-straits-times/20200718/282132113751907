    <p>Three teenagers who brazenly used an elec­tronic va­por­iser on­board an MRT train, and posted the act on so­cial me­dia, have been hauled up by the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity (HSA) said an 18-year-old boy was fined $500 for us­ing an e-va­por­iser.</p>
    <p>The bat­tery-pow­ered de­vice heats a liq­uid called “vape juice”, which con­tains nico­tine, to pro­duce a vapour that is then in­haled.</p>
    <p>HSA said a 16-year-old girl was fined $200 for the same of­fence, and was also given a con­di­tional warn­ing for pro­vid­ing false in­for­ma­tion dur­ing the in­ves­ti­ga­tion and pos­sess­ing a packet of cig­a­rettes.</p>
    <p>The third mem­ber of the group – a 13-year-old girl – was given a con­di­tional warn­ing for us­ing an e-va­por­iser.</p>
    <p>HSA said it was alerted on March 29 to a video of the teenagers us­ing the e-va­por­iser in the MRT cabin. The video was filmed and up­loaded on so­cial me­dia by one of the teenagers.</p>
    <p>An eight-sec­ond video cir­cu­lat­ing on­line shows a teenage girl in­hal­ing from a pen-like ob­ject and blow­ing vapour into a boy’s shirt while some­one else films them.</p>
    <p>Po­lice of­fi­cers iden­ti­fied the teenagers and their in­ves­ti­ga­tions showed all three of them had taken turns to use the e-va­por­iser on March 25.</p>
    <p>“The teenagers had bla­tantly flouted the law by va­p­ing in plain sight of com­muters on the train where smok­ing is pro­hib­ited, and de­lib­er­ately flaunted their of­fence on so­cial me­dia,” the HSA said.</p>
    <p>Since Feb 1, 2018, it has been il­le­gal to pos­sess, buy or use e-va­por­is­ers. Offenders can be fined up to $2,000.</p>
    <p>From when the law was in­tro­duced to June 30 this year, 1,335 peo­ple have been caught us­ing e-va­por­is­ers.</p>
    <p>In its state­ment, HSA re­minded mem­bers of the public that it is also an of­fence to sell, im­port or dis­trib­ute e-va­por­is­ers.</p>
    <p>Any­one found guilty of do­ing so can be fined up to $10,000, jailed for up to six months, or both.</p>
    <p>Re­peat offenders can be fined up to $20,000, jailed for up to one year, or both.</p>
    <p>If mem­bers of the public have in­for­ma­tion on the il­le­gal im­por­ta­tion, dis­tri­bu­tion or sale of e-va­por­is­ers, they can call HSA’s To­bacco Reg­u­la­tion Branch on 6684-2036 or 6684-2037, or e-mail HSA at hsa_trb@hsa.gov.sg</p>
