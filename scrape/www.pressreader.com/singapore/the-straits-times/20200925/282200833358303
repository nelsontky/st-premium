    </section>

    <p>Be­sides TraceTo­gether’s Blue­tooth tech­nol­ogy, the Gov­ern­ment should ex­plore emerg­ing tech­nolo­gies such as the more ef­fi­cient ul­tra-wide band (Con­tact trac­ing to get a boost with dis­tri­bu­tion of new to­kens, Sept 12). UWB is in­tended for real-time lo­ca­tion sys­tems and its pre­ci­sion ca­pa­bil­i­ties and low power make it very suit­able for ra­dio fre­quency-sen­si­tive, crowded en­vi­ron­ments. It is cur­rently utilised in hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>With UWB em­bed­ded in 5G-en­abled phones, cou­pled with TraceTo­gether to­kens, this will en­sure that con­tact trac­ing is more pro­fi­cient in this Covid-19 era.</p>

    <p>SIL­VER PAS­SION CARD DRAW­BACKS</p>
    <p>I was so happy to fi­nally re­ceive my sil­ver PAs­sion card which dou­bles as a trans­port con­ces­sion card.</p>
    <p>But my hap­pi­ness was short-lived when I re­alised how ar­chaic the card is for this day and age. I can­not make any other trans­ac­tions or dig­i­tal trans­fers with the card ex­cept to use it for my trans­porta­tion, namely buses and trains only. There is no fea­ture en­abling me to go cash­less with it. I can­not use it to pay for any pur­chase. In the end, I am sad­dled with an­other card tak­ing up space in my wal­let as it pro­vides me the con­ces­sion I need. It can­not be stored into any e-wal­let as well.</p>
    <p>I hope the card can quickly as­sim­i­late the payWave or ez-link func­tions to make it more vi­able for use.</p>
    <p>be­ing dis­carded.</p>
    <p>Let us all do our part by dis­pos­ing of our waste re­spon­si­bly and re­cy­cling as much as we can to en­hance our en­vi­ron­ment’s sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>

    <p>CARE­FUL HOW WE DIS­POSE OF WASTE</p>
    <p>I was con­cerned by the pic­tures of aux­il­iary po­lice­men emp­ty­ing nu­mer­ous bot­tles and cans of al­co­hol into a drain (MOM to con­sider eas­ing al­co­hol ban in dorms, but checks to con­tinue for now, Sept 19).</p>
    <p>These drains chan­nel rain­wa­ter to our wa­ter catch­ment ar­eas. They should not be pol­luted by liq­uid waste like al­co­hol, oil, detergent and other chem­i­cal solutions.</p>
    <p>The many emp­tied glass bot­tles and me­tal cans should also be re­cy­cled in­stead of sim­ply</p>
    <p>STORE WA­TER UN­DER­GROUND</p>
    <p>As wa­ter is such a pre­cious com­mod­ity in Sin­ga­pore, why don’t the town plan­ners de­sign large tun­nels of wa­ter re­ten­tion tanks un­der­neath all roads? There are al­ready drains along all roads now; wa­ter can flow from these drains di­rectly into the re­ten­tion tun­nels un­der the roads. Imag­ine the amount of wa­ter that can be col­lected and stored. If the plan­ners are al­ready think­ing of build­ing un­der­ground for added space in land-con­strained Sin­ga­pore, they should build wa­ter re­ten­tion tanks un­der all the roads as well.</p>
