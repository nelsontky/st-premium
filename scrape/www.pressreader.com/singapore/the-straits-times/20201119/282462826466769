    <p>The back­lot at Bad Wolf Stu­dios is a world trans­formed.</p>
    <p>Or­di­nar­ily, this mod­est patch of as­phalt is a park­ing lot for the ac­tors’ trail­ers and the mo­bile of­fices that spring up along­side film and tele­vi­sion pro­duc­tions.</p>
    <p>But it is now the set for a much more glam­orous un­der­tak­ing. It is dressed for its star­ring role in the se­cond sea­son of His Dark Ma­te­ri­als, the BBC/HBO adap­ta­tion of Philip Pull­man’s book tril­ogy of the same name (com­pris­ing Northern Lights, The Sub­tle Knife and The Am­ber Spy­glass).</p>
    <p>The show airs on Tues­days at 10am and 10pm on HBO (StarHub TV Chan­nel 601 and Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 420) and also streams on HBO Go.</p>
    <p>The lot is criss-crossed with a labyrinth of sun-faded pas­tel brick­work, hous­ing a se­ries of wind­ing al­leys, each pock­eted with shops and door­ways to tucked-away dwellings.</p>
    <p>This is the fan­tas­tic city of Cit­tagazze, which plays a prom­i­nent role in the se­cond book of the se­ries, The Sub­tle Knife (1997).</p>
    <p>Visit­ing the set late last year, we jour­nal­ists wan­der the cob­bles on which the star of the TV adap­ta­tion, Dafne Keen, is spend­ing most of her days. It is a world dressed in great de­tail – there is even real bread in the bak­ery.</p>
    <p>Keen plays the se­ries’ lead, Lyra Belac­qua, and she joins us on set dur­ing a break in film­ing, lap­ping up the smell of the freshly baked bread.</p>
    <p>“It’s just like be­ing in a real city,” says Keen, who was 14 years old at the time. “This set is just big. Ev­ery­thing in this sea­son does feel re­ally epic.”</p>
    <p>The first sea­son of His Dark Ma­te­ri­als has a score of 83 per cent on the ag­gre­ga­tor web­site Rot­ten Toma­toes, and it won Bri­tish Academy Tele­vi­sion Craft Awards for Spe­cial, Vis­ual & Graphic Ef­fects as well as for Ti­tles & Graphic Iden­tity.</p>
    <p>The se­cond sea­son is set to con­tinue Lyra’s story as told in The Sub­tle Knife and it is in­deed epic in scope.</p>
    <p>Cit­tagazze, for ex­am­ple, is a city in an­other world and a place where par­al­lel uni­verses in­ter­sect. Lyra is about to un­der­take some se­ri­ous trav­el­ling.</p>
    <p>“That’s def­i­nitely some­thing that’s new to this sea­son,” adds Keen, who rose to promi­nence star­ring op­po­site Hugh Jack­man in the 2017 X-Men spin-off Lo­gan. “I get very cool lines talk­ing about mul­ti­ple uni­verses. In fact, Lyra is quite cool through­out Sea­son 2, where she is dis­cov­er­ing all about Dust, par­ti­cles and all this amaz­ing stuff.”</p>
    <p>Lyra’s bid to un­der­stand Dust – the mys­te­ri­ous par­ti­cles con­nected to con­scious­ness – pro­pels her story through the sev­enepisode se­ries and she is helped on her quest by Will Parry, played by Amir Wil­son, with whom she teams up in Cit­tagazze.</p>
    <p>Keen says: “For me, that’s been the big­gest dif­fer­ence be­tween film­ing the two sea­sons. While I am alone for much of Sea­son 1, now I get to con­stantly film with Amir, who is lovely. We are re­ally good friends.”</p>
    <p>These newly forged friend­ships have been vi­tal in a lengthy shoot­ing sched­ule that films the first two sea­sons back to back.</p>
    <p>And while many of the prom­i­nent cast mem­bers – in­clud­ing James McAvoy (who plays Lord As­riel), Ruth Wil­son (Marisa Coul­ter), Anne-Marie Duff (Ma Costa) and Lin-Manuel Mi­randa (Lee Scoresby) – can come and go as they film their scenes, Keen is re­quired every day.</p>
    <p>“We are film­ing two sea­sons in a row be­cause Dafne is grow­ing up fast and you don’t want her to look like a dif­fer­ent per­son for the se­cond se­ries,” says Mi­randa, the multi-award-win­ning cre­ator and star of Broad­way hit Hamil­ton, when he joins us on set.</p>
    <p>“She is 14 years old and you grow up much quicker when you are a teenager,” notes the ac­tor, who plays an ad­ven­turer, aero­naut and one of Lyra’s al­lies. “She has been such a joy. We have spo­ken Span­ish and sung chill tunes all the time.”</p>
    <p>When film­ing Lo­gan, Keen and Jack­man also sang show tunes in be­tween takes. “So I just slid right into that,” says Mi­randa with a laugh.</p>
    <p>“Se­ri­ously, though, the BBC and HBO have spared no ex­pense and re­ally made Philip Pull­man’s world come to life as beau­ti­fully as pos­si­ble with sets like Cit­tagazze.</p>
    <p>“And not only that, but also with their com­mit­ment in the sched­ule, shoot­ing the two sea­sons back to back. We’ve all tried to make the best show with an eye to some­thing that is go­ing to last.”</p>

    <p>His Dark Ma­te­ri­als 2 airs on Tues­days at 10am and 10pm on HBO (StarHub TV Chan­nel 601 and Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 420) and also streams on HBO Go.</p>
    <p>Teenage ac­tress Dafne Keen (above fore­ground) plays Lyra Belac­qua, the lead in the His Dark Ma­te­ri­als se­ries, which is back for a se­cond sea­son.</p>
