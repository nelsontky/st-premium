    <p>Across the world, glaciers are in trou­ble. Global warm­ing is speed­ing up their melt­ing and dis­rupt­ing weather pat­terns that can bring too much or too lit­tle rain to the moun­tains.</p>
    <p>Bil­lions of peo­ple, es­pe­cially in Asia, rely on these vast store­houses of ice for drink­ing wa­ter, ir­ri­ga­tion and hy­dropower.</p>
    <p>Ac­cel­er­ated melt­ing raises river flows and height­ens the risks of floods. Rapid melt­ing of glaciers from China to Greenland and Antarc­tica also in­creases sea lev­els, threat­en­ing low-ly­ing coast­lines. In one ex­am­ple, glaciers in China’s Qil­ian moun­tains high on the Ti­betan plateau are dis­ap­pear­ing at an alarm­ing rate, rais­ing the prospect of crip­pling, long-term wa­ter short­ages, sci­en­tists say.</p>
    <p>The largest glacier in the 800km moun­tain chain on the arid north­east­ern edge of the plateau has re­treated about 450m since the 1950s, when China’s first mon­i­tor­ing sta­tion was set up to study it. But it is not just the dis­tance that glaciers are re­treat­ing. Just as con­cern­ing is the over­all loss of mass, or thick­ness. Lao­hugou No. 12, for in­stance, has lost 13m of ice, Dr Qin Xiang, the di­rec­tor at the mon­i­tor­ing sta­tion, told Reuters.</p>
    <p>Since the 1950s, av­er­age tem­per­a­tures in the area have risen about 1.5 deg C, Dr Qin said, and with no sign of an end to warm­ing, the out­look is grim for the 2,684 glaciers in the Qil­ian range.</p>
    <p>Across the moun­tains, glacier re­treat was 50 per cent faster in 1990-2010 than it was from 1956 to 1990, data from the China Acad­emy of Sciences shows.</p>
    <p>The fate of many other glaciers in the re­gion is bleak, too.</p>
    <p>The Ti­betan plateau and the Hi­malaya-Hindu Kush moun­tain range are part of what is known as the world’s Third Pole be­cause the huge ice fields con­tain the largest re­serve of fresh wa­ter out­side the po­lar re­gions.</p>
    <p>This re­gion is the source of 10 ma­jor river sys­tems, in­clud­ing the Brahma­pu­tra, Ganges, In­dus and Mekong, which are eco­nomic en­gines of the re­gion.</p>
    <p>The UN cli­mate panel said in a land­mark 2019 re­port the glaciers in the Hindu Kush Hi­malaya re­gion, which pro­vide wa­ter for about two bil­lion peo­ple, are melt­ing quickly and this could ac­cel­er­ate un­less mankind makes deep cuts in green­house gas emis­sions.</p>
    <p>The dan­ger is that rapid melt­ing will, ini­tially, in­crease wa­ter flows in the next few decades. Melt­wa­ter feed­ing the rivers would then de­cline as the glaciers shrink.</p>
    <p>That could trig­ger un­rest as na­tions clash over wa­ter sup­plies.</p>
    <p>In Europe, glaciers are also shrink­ing at shock­ing rates. Switzer­land has l ost over 500 glaciers since 1900. Mer de Glace, the long­est glacier in France, has re­ceded more than 2km up the moun­tain since the 19th cen­tury.</p>
    <p>Of even greater con­cern are the glaciers in Greenland and Antarc­tica, which could push up sea lev­els by sev­eral me­tres in the com­ing cen­turies if the world stays on track to warm at least 3 deg C by the end of this cen­tury.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists say Greenland is start­ing to melt faster than at any time in the past 12,000 years.</p>
    <p>Last year, Greenland set a new record for ice loss, shed­ding the most mass from its gi­ant ice sheet in any year since at least 1948.</p>
