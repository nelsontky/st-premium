    <p>A 64-year-old man, who had a his­tory of hy­per­ten­sion, has died from com­pli­ca­tions due to Covid-19, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The per­ma­nent res­i­dent is the 28th pa­tient to die from the virus here, al­most three months since the last Covid-19-re­lated death.</p>
    <p>He had been work­ing in In­dia since last De­cem­ber, and was placed on stay-home no­tice when he re­turned to Sin­ga­pore on Sept 23.</p>
    <p>He was con­firmed to have the coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion on Oct 4.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hospi­tal has reached out to his fam­ily and is ex­tend­ing as­sis­tance to them.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, the last pa­tient to die here from Covid-19-re­lated com­pli­ca­tions was a 62-year-old man on July 14.</p>
    <p>There were four new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day. This is the low­est daily count since March 4, when two cases were re­ported.</p>
    <p>They in­cluded one com­mu­nity case, who is a fam­ily mem­ber of pre­vi­ously con­firmed cases, said MOH.</p>
    <p>She had been iden­ti­fied as a con­tact of two other cases and had been placed on quar­an­tine ear­lier.</p>
    <p>All three cases ar­rived from In­dia on Sept 16, and were placed on stay­home no­tice at a ded­i­cated fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>There were also two im­ported cases, com­pris­ing one per­ma­nent res­i­dent who re­turned to Sin­ga­pore from the Philip­pines, and one work pass holder who ar­rived from In­dia and the United Arab Emi­rates.</p>
    <p>They had both been placed on stay-home no­tice upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, and were tested even though they were asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>A mi­grant worker liv­ing in a dor­mi­tory made up the re­main­ing case con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,880.</p>
    <p>He had been iden­ti­fied ear­lier as a con­tact of pre­vi­ous cases, and had al­ready been quar­an­tined to pre­vent fur­ther trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>He was tested dur­ing quar­an­tine to de­ter­mine his sta­tus, even though he was asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>MOH also said the clus­ter at 9 Sungei Kadut Av­enue has been closed as it has not had new cases linked to it for 28 days, or two in­cu­ba­tion pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from an av­er­age of one case per day in the week be­fore, to an av­er­age of fewer than one per day in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also de­creased from an av­er­age of fewer than one case per day in the week be­fore, to none in the past week.</p>
    <p>With 23 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,713 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 48 pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 76 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Fif­teen peo­ple who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
