    <p>• The star-stud­ded In­dian Premier League (IPL) cricket will start on Sept 19 in the United Arab Emi­rates, its chair­man said yes­ter­day, adding that play­ers may need to un­dergo quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Al­though In­dia’s cricket au­thor­i­ties are still await­ing gov­ern­ment ap­proval, Bri­jesh Patel said the world’s rich­est cricket tour­na­ment will be played for 51 days with the fi­nal on Nov 8.</p>
    <p>Un­der cur­rent UAE coro­n­avirus rules, all trav­ellers must self-iso­late for two weeks af­ter ar­riv­ing.</p>
    <p>“What­ever are the UAE rules for tourists will be fol­lowed by ev­ery­one,” Patel said.</p>
    <p>“The IPL will take place be­tween Sept 19 and Nov 8. This is con­firmed and the rest we will de­cide in the (IPL) govern­ing coun­cil meet­ing next week.”</p>
    <p>Top stars rang­ing from Eng­land’s Ben Stokes to Aus­tralians Steve Smith and David Warner have been lined up by the eight IPL teams on lu­cra­tive con­tracts.</p>
    <p>Any quar­an­tine pe­riod could clash with do­mes­tic sea­sons.</p>
    <p>Patel said the Board of Con­trol for Cricket in In­dia will pre­pare op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures to combat the virus threat dur­ing the tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>“It is go­ing to be a full-fledged 51-day IPL,” he said.</p>
    <p>The 13th year of the IPL was to have started in March but has been re­peat­edly post­poned be­cause of the pan­demic. Dates were fi­nally set af­ter the T20 World Cup, which was to start in Aus­tralia in Oc­to­ber, was post­poned this week.</p>
    <p>The IPL was held out­side In­dia twice when it clashed with na­tional elec­tions. South Africa hosted the 2009 event and part of it was held in the UAE in 2014.</p>
    <p>The IPL is the BCCI’s main rev­enue earner. It has said it would lose more than US$500 mil­lion (S$692 mil­lion) if this year’s tour­na­ment does not gone ahead.</p>
