    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong will take the stand when his defama­tion trial against fi­nan­cial ad­viser and blog­ger Leong Sze Hian opens in the High Court next month.</p>
    <p>The hear­ing, which is set to take place from Oct 6 to 9, was con­firmed at a pre-trial con­fer­ence with Jus­tice Aedit Ab­dul­lah yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to queries from The Straits Times, a spokesman for PM Lee said the Prime Min­is­ter will en­ter the wit­ness box to give ev­i­dence and be cross-ex­am­ined.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post fol­low­ing the con­fer­ence, Mr Leong’s lawyer Lim</p>
    <p>Tean wrote: “The ex­pert wit­ness who is to be called by PM Lee, Dr Tuan Quang Phan, will give ev­i­dence via video link from Hong Kong.”</p>
    <p>Dr Phan is an as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of mar­ket­ing as well as in­no­va­tion and in­for­ma­tion man­age­ment at Hong Kong Univer­sity Busi­ness School.</p>
    <p>PM Lee will be rep­re­sented by Se­nior Coun­sel Davin­der Singh from Davin­der Singh Cham­bers.</p>
    <p>PM Lee had filed the suit over a post shared by Mr Leong on his Face­book page on Nov 7, 2018, which con­tained a link to an ar­ti­cle by Malaysian news site The Cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>The ar­ti­cle con­tained al­le­ga­tions that for­mer Malaysian prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak had signed “se­cret deals” with PM Lee in ex­change for</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore banks’ help in laun­der­ing money from 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had, or 1MDB.</p>
    <p>In pa­pers filed in court, the le­gal team rep­re­sent­ing PM Lee said the al­le­ga­tions were “false and base­less”, and it was clear Mr Leong had pub­lished the post “ma­li­ciously and to dam­age our client”.</p>
    <p>PM Lee is seek­ing ag­gra­vated dam­ages and an in­junc­tion to pre­vent Mr Leong from pub­lish­ing or dis­sem­i­nat­ing the defam­a­tory al­le­ga­tions, or other al­le­ga­tions of com­plic­ity in mat­ters re­lat­ing to Malaysia’s em­bat­tled sov­er­eign wealth fund.</p>
    <p>In his de­fence, Mr Leong de­nied that he was be­ing ma­li­cious.</p>
    <p>He said in court pa­pers that he took down his Face­book post on Nov 10 that year af­ter be­ing told to do so by the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity. He also ar­gued that the ar­ti­cle, on how Sin­ga­pore and PM Lee had be­come tar­gets of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion into 1MDB, was “a mat­ter of pub­lic in­ter­est... whether or not it was cor­rect”.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong filed a coun­ter­claim against PM Lee, claim­ing that the defama­tion suit against him is an abuse of the process of the court.</p>
    <p>In March last year, the High Court al­lowed an ap­pli­ca­tion by PM Lee to strike out the coun­ter­claim.</p>
    <p>The court said the abuse of court process is not recog­nised in Sin­ga­pore law as a ba­sis for one party to bring le­gal action against an­other.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion was up­held in September last year by the Court of Ap­peal, which noted that recog­nis­ing the abuse of court process as a cause of action would “en­cour­age un­nec­es­sary satel­lite lit­i­ga­tion”.</p>
