    <p>Get­ting to grips with par­lia­men­tary busi­ness</p>
    <p>Par­lia­men­tary pro­cesses are com­pli­cated and can trip up new­bies, and even old-timers.</p>
    <p>Shortly af­ter Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Man­power Tan See Leng con­cluded his speech, WP chief Pri­tam Singh raised his hand, seek­ing clar­i­fi­ca­tion. But Speaker of Par­lia­ment Tan Chuan-Jin failed to see it. Per­haps the three hours of speeches from MPs had given him some food for thought. He ab­sent-mind­edly called for a 15-minute break.</p>
    <p>When the House re­sumed busi­ness, Mr Tan was quick to rec­tify his er­ror, but not with­out a touch of hu­mour: “Apolo­gies, I missed your hand. I must have been too hun­gry just now,” he quipped.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh shrugged it off: “It’s okay, Mr Speaker, thank you.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Dr Tan de­liv­ered his maiden speech with­out a hitch as he pep­pered it with anec­dotes and Chi­nese idioms to il­lus­trate how busi­nesses will be sup­ported to adapt to new chal­lenges sparked by the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>But in an ex­change with the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion, he seemed to be hun­gry for more – ques­tions, that is.</p>
    <p>Af­ter re­spond­ing to Mr Singh twice, he con­tin­ued to stay seated in the front row, un­aware that the ex­change was over.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, sit­ting four seats to his left, came to the res­cue. He caught his eye, nod­ded and in­di­cated he could re­turn to his seat in the sec­ond row. Dr Tan hastily stood up, masked him­self up and moved back to his seat.</p>
