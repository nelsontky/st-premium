    <p>HOW DID THE HACK­ERS GET IN?</p>
    <p>Hack­ers man­aged to com­pro­mise and in­stall mal­ware on a piece of se­cu­rity soft­ware – the Orion se­cu­rity tool de­vel­oped by So­larWinds which is used for man­age­ment and su­per­vi­sion of IT net­works.</p>
    <p>The hack­ers aimed to com­pro­mise the soft­ware’s au­to­matic up­date func­tion. The break-in fur­ther al­lowed them to gain an idea of their vic­tim’s sys­temic struc­tural vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The mal­ware was laced into the soft­ware up­dates that breached net­work se­cu­rity and al­lowed ac­cess to data, in­clud­ing mail, with FireEye say­ing the breaches be­gan around March.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>WHO ARE</p>
    <p>THE VIC­TIMS?</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to So­larWinds, 18,000 users of Orion have po­ten­tially suf­fered a se­cu­rity breach, in­clud­ing govern­ment agen­cies and For­tune 500 com­pa­nies. Th­ese in­clude:</p>
    <p>Firms or in­sti­tu­tions that have used in­fected up­dates are urged to dis­con­nect their servers and check for tell­tale signs their data might have been com­pro­mised.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>WHO IS TO BLAME?</p>
    <p>FireEye and Mi­crosoft be­lieve the at­tack was by a na­tion state and ex­pert anal­y­sis has pointed the fin­ger at Rus­sia, as have anony­mous US se­cu­rity sources.</p>
    <p>Th­ese US sources have fo­cused on an or­gan­i­sa­tion known as ad­vanced per­sis­tent threat (APT) 29, or Cozy Bear, which is be­lieved to be linked to one or more Rus­sian in­tel­li­gence agen­cies and pre­vi­ously pi­rated the White House un­der for­mer US pres­i­dent Barack Obama.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>LESSONS TO LEARN</p>
    <p>Mr Jac­ques de la Riviere, who runs French cy­ber-se­cu­rity firm Gate­watcher, says he has re­sponded by ramp­ing up pro­tec­tion on his own servers.</p>
    <p>Be­yond that, he hopes the high-pro­file at­tack will en­cour­age firms and in­sti­tu­tions to be more de­mand­ing when it comes to ste­ward­ship of their data and soft­ware se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>“This could be a turn­ing point, where many clients are go­ing to start say­ing ‘I no longer want to pur­chase soft­ware that has not been cer­ti­fied by a third party’,” he said.</p>
