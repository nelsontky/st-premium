    <p>• An air­craft car­rier group led by China’s new­est car­rier, the Shan­dong, has sailed through the Tai­wan Strait on its way to rou­tine drills in the South China Sea, China’s navy said yes­ter­day, af­ter Tai­wan mo­bilised its forces to mon­i­tor the trip.</p>
    <p>While it is not the first time China’s car­ri­ers have passed close to Tai­wan, it comes at a time of height­ened ten­sion be­tween Taipei and Bei­jing, which claims the demo­crat­i­cally ruled is­land as its ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>The Shan­dong car­rier group sailed through the Tai­wan Strait a day af­ter a US war­ship tran­sited the same wa­ter­way. China’s mil­i­tary said it tailed the ship.</p>
    <p>China’s navy said the Shan­dong and its ac­com­pa­ny­ing ships “smoothly” tran­sited the sen­si­tive and nar­row Tai­wan Strait on Sun­day, head­ing for ex­er­cises in the South China Sea, where China has ex­ten­sive and dis­puted ter­ri­to­rial claims.</p>
    <p>The drills are part of “nor­mal ar­range­ments made in ac­cor­dance with an­nual plans”, it said. “In the fu­ture, we will con­tinue to or­gan­ise sim­i­lar op­er­a­tions based on train­ing needs.”</p>
    <p>Tai­wan’s De­fence Min­istry said the Shan­dong was ac­com­pa­nied by four war­ships and had set out from the north­ern Chi­nese port of Dalian last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan said it sent six war­ships and eight air force air­craft to “stand guard” and mon­i­tor the Chi­nese ships’ move­ments.</p>
    <p>The Shan­dong is China’s sec­ond car­rier, and was for­mally com­mis­sioned al­most ex­actly a year ago.</p>
    <p>Since then, it has suc­cess­fully com­pleted tasks such as car­rier-based air­craft take-off and land­ing and use of its weapons, the Chi­nese navy said.</p>
    <p>“The com­bat ca­pa­bil­ity of the for­ma­tion sys­tem has been con­tin­u­ously im­proved in ex­per­i­men­tal train­ing,” it added, re­fer­ring to the group of war­ships which ac­com­pany the Shan­dong.</p>
    <p>China has been work­ing to hone its car­rier op­er­a­tions, but has lit­tle ex­pe­ri­ence com­pared with the United States, which has been op­er­at­ing in­te­grated car­rier bat­tle groups with mul­ti­ple ves­sels for decades.</p>
