    <p>Sports psy­chol­o­gists fre­quently rec­om­mend cre­at­ing small mile­stones en route to a big goal.</p>
    <p>“Set­ting goals that are con­trol­lable makes it eas­ier to adapt,” says Dr Mei­jen.</p>
    <p>“If you set goals that are con­trolled by other peo­ple, goals that aren’t re­al­is­tic or are tough or bor­ing, those are much harder to adapt to.”</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can pro­fes­sional ul­tra­run­ner Coree Wolter­ing is skilled at con­quer­ing mini goals. The long-dis­tance run­ner has stood on the podium af­ter races from 50km to 160km.</p>
    <p>This sum­mer, he set his sights on break­ing the running record on the Ice Age Trail, some 1,845km across Wis­con­sin. He ran more than 80km a day, for three weeks, to ac­com­plish the feat.</p>
    <p>“I’m re­ally good at break­ing things down into small in­cre­ments and set­ting mi­cro­goals,” he says.</p>
    <p>How mi­cro? “I break things down to 10 sec­onds at a time,” he says. “You just have to be present in what you are do­ing and you have to know that it may not be the most fun – or su­per painful – now, but that could change in 10 sec­onds down the road.”</p>
    <p>And it may not change quickly. Wolter­ing has spent six-hour stretches count­ing to 10 over and over again.</p>
    <p>“You just keep mov­ing and keep count­ing,” he says.</p>
    <p>“And you have to have faith that it will change at some point.”</p>
