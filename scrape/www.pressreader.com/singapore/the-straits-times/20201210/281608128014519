    <p>If peo­ple from both coun­try A and B can come to Sin­ga­pore safely, then we have a com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>TRADE AND IN­DUS­TRY MIN­IS­TER CHAN CHUN SING, as­sur­ing par­tic­i­pants com­ing to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will put in place three lev­els of safe­guards to re­as­sure both Sin­ga­pore­ans and par­tic­i­pants when the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum (WEF) meet­ing is held here next year, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter</p>
    <p>Chan Chun Sing said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>First, Sin­ga­pore­ans, es­pe­cially those who may in­ter­act with par­tic­i­pants, will need to be as­sured that the meet­ing can be con­ducted safely, with vis­i­tors en­ter­ing the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, par­tic­i­pants across coun­tries must feel safe min­gling with one an­other.</p>
    <p>The third level of safe­guards is that those at­tend­ing the meet­ing must be given a clean bill of health be­fore they go back to their own coun­tries or on­wards to other places, so that there will be no mis­un­der­stand­ing that any­one con­tracted the virus while they were in Sin­ga­pore, Mr Chan said.</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing to re­porters yes­ter­day on the side­lines of a me­dia visit to Siemens Ad­vance Man­u­fac­tur­ing Trans­for­ma­tion Cen­tre in Tuas, where he met trainees of the ad­di­tive-man­u­fac­tur­ing train­ing course un­der the SGUnited Mid-Ca­reer Path­ways Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, the WEF an­nounced its de­ci­sion to move the an­nual fo­rum from Switzer­land to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The meet­ing in May next year will see top po­lit­i­cal, busi­ness and aca­demic lead­ers gather to dis­cuss press­ing global is­sues.</p>
    <p>This will be WEF’s sec­ond time hold­ing its meet­ing out­side of Switzer­land since it be­gan in 1971, and the first time hold­ing it in Asia.</p>
    <p>The 2002 edi­tion was held in New York, to show sol­i­dar­ity with the United States and the peo­ple of the city af­ter the Sept 11 ter­ror at­tacks the year be­fore.</p>
    <p>The WEF said it de­cided Sin­ga­pore was best placed to host the meet­ing in the light of the cur­rent Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion world­wide.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said that if par­tic­i­pants can be as­sured that peo­ple from dif­fer­ent coun­tries can meet here</p>
    <p>safely, Sin­ga­pore will have a com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>He said: “If peo­ple from both coun­try A and B can come to Sin­ga­pore safely, then we have a com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>“This is go­ing to be a demon­stra­tion of how we are able to con­duct such high-level meet­ings in a way that pro­vides the nec­es­sary health as­sur­ances to par­tic­i­pants from dif­fer­ent coun­tries, that this is a safe place for them to be.”</p>
    <p>But Mr Chan stressed that Sin­ga­pore should not “get too far ahead of our­selves at this point in time”.</p>
    <p>He said: “When WEF chose Sin­ga­pore, it was a state­ment of their con­fi­dence in our abil­ity to man­age the sit­u­a­tion now and over the next few months. But hav­ing said that, we shouldn’t be complacent.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan added: “We must stay very fo­cused and get the job done well – we must make sure that we con­tain the virus, man­age the num­bers to keep them as low as pos­si­ble, to give as­sur­ance to our­selves and to the guests that will be com­ing.”</p>
