    <p>Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) MPs must ex­pect sharper ques­tion­ing and more ro­bust de­bates in Par­lia­ment with more op­po­si­tion MPs and a Leader of the Op­po­si­tion in the House, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
    <p>In an eight-page let­ter to all rul­ing party MPs on how they should con­duct them­selves, re­leased to the me­dia yes­ter­day, PM Lee told them to be prepared to en­gage the op­po­si­tion, to clar­ify their in­ter­ven­tions and scru­ti­nise their ideas.</p>
    <p>“PAP MPs should ex­press their views frankly, whether for or against gov­ern­ment poli­cies. Dur­ing de­bates, speak freely and with con­vic­tion. Press your points vig­or­ously, and do not shy away from ro­bust ex­change,” he said in the let­ter ti­tled “rules of pru­dence”, which is tra­di­tion­ally is­sued to PAP MPs after each gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, please ex­er­cise judgment when putting your points across, and do not get car­ried away play­ing to the gallery,” he added.</p>
    <p>The PAP won 83 out of 93 seats and 61.2 per cent of the votes in the July 10 polls, in which all seats were con­tested. With the Work­ers’ Party tak­ing 10 seats, party chief Pri­tam Singh will for­mally be ap­pointed Leader of the Op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>On the PAP’s re­sults, PM Lee said: “The peo­ple have en­dorsed what we have done in our pre­vi­ous term, and given us a clear man­date to take Sin­ga­pore for­ward, through the cri­sis and be­yond.</p>
    <p>“Now we must work with Sin­ga­pore­ans to keep Covid-19 in check, pro­tect jobs and liveli­hoods, and make sure ev­ery­one comes through safely to­gether.”</p>
    <p>This time around, PM Lee also specif­i­cally ad­dressed the use of so­cial me­dia by MPs in his let­ter.</p>
    <p>He noted that so­cial me­dia has be­come a part of daily lives and MPs are free to use it to let the pub­lic know about their work or their views. He urged them to “have some fun” and to “try out dif­fer­ent plat­forms”, but to also be mind­ful that they are elected pub­lic fig­ures.</p>
    <p>“So ob­serve deco­rum, en­sure fac­tual ac­cu­racy as this is an ab­so­lute re­quire­ment for us, and re­mem­ber ev­ery so­cial me­dia post will be per­ma­nently as­so­ci­ated with you and the party,” he said. “Be hon­est, em­pa­thetic, pos­i­tive and af­firm­ing in all your mes­sages. Know your au­di­ence and be sen­si­tive to how they feel. Do not use so­cial me­dia to at­tack another per­son,” he added.</p>
    <p>PM Lee also re­minded MPs that so­cial me­dia is but one way to con­nect with peo­ple, and they have to at­tend to res­i­dents’ needs and in­ter­act with them in per­son.</p>
    <p>The rest of the let­ter set out in de­tail the stan­dards that PAP MPs must abide by in ar­eas rang­ing from par­lia­men­tary at­ten­dance to the ac­cep­tance of com­pany di­rec­tor­ships to re­ceiv­ing gifts.</p>
    <p>As in years past, PM Lee stressed the im­por­tance of up­hold­ing the party’s rep­u­ta­tion for clean and in­cor­rupt­ible gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>To this end, MPs should sep­a­rate their pub­lic po­lit­i­cal sta­tus from their pri­vate busi­ness or pro­fes­sional in­ter­ests, he said. This means they should, among other things, be care­ful of the in­vi­ta­tions and gifts they ac­cept, and en­sure they do not lobby pub­lic of­fi­cers on behalf of friends, clients or their em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>MPs also should not so­licit di­rec­tor­ships, nor ac­cept those where the com­pany wants to “dress up the board with a PAP MP or two, in or­der to make the com­pany look re­spectable”.</p>
    <p>PM Lee also cau­tioned MPs against us­ing Par­lia­ment to lobby the Gov­ern­ment on behalf of their busi­ness or clients. “You may, how­ever, re­lay feed­back and speak freely to Cab­i­net min­is­ters... min­is­ters will lis­ten care­fully to ar­gu­ments on prin­ci­ples, es­pe­cially when they re­late to the gen­eral pol­icy of their min­istries. But min­is­ters will not ex­er­cise their dis­cre­tion to change individual decisions with­out very good reasons which they can jus­tify pub­licly,” he said.</p>
    <p>Even when rais­ing funds for non­po­lit­i­cal pur­poses for con­stituency and grass­roots or­gan­i­sa­tions, MPs have to be ex­tra scrupu­lous in ac­cept­ing do­na­tions.</p>
    <p>He ad­vised them to gather mul­ti­ple small con­tri­bu­tions, rather than de­pend on one or two large donors so as to “avoid in­cur­ring obli­ga­tions which may ex­pose you to awk­ward re­quests later”.</p>
    <p>PM Lee also urged MPs to al­ways lis­ten closely to Sin­ga­pore­ans, help them tackle press­ing needs, and ac­cu­rately re­flect their wor­ries and as­pi­ra­tions to the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“Never break faith with the peo­ple,” he said.</p>
    <p>In Par­lia­ment, MPs’ hon­est, in­formed views are im­por­tant po­lit­i­cal in­put to min­is­ters in pol­i­cy­mak­ing, he told them. And min­is­ters will ac­cept all valid, con­struc­tive sug­ges­tions, but will also have to chal­lenge in­ac­cu­rate or mis­taken views.</p>
    <p>“Over time, the pub­lic will see that PAP back­benchers are as ef­fec­tive as op­po­si­tion MPs, if not bet­ter, at hold­ing min­is­ters to ac­count, get­ting is­sues fully de­bated, and in­flu­enc­ing poli­cies for the bet­ter,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that he has asked the Speaker of Par­lia­ment to give all MPs, par­tic­u­larly new MPs, am­ple op­por­tu­nity and lat­i­tude to speak, not­ing that their first op­por­tu­nity will be dur­ing the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress at the open­ing of Par­lia­ment later this month.</p>
    <p>Sum­ming up the let­ter in a Face­book post shar­ing it yes­ter­day, PM Lee said: “Whether or not we are in a pan­demic, our re­spon­si­bil­ity as MPs is clear. We are ser­vants of the peo­ple, and will carry out our du­ties with in­tegrity, hon­esty and in­cor­rupt­ibil­ity. We will al­ways be sen­si­tive to the views and at­ti­tudes of the peo­ple we rep­re­sent, and con­duct our­selves with hu­mil­ity, mod­esty, deco­rum and dig­nity.”</p>
