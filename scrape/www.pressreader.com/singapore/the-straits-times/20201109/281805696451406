    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Two peo­ple were killed when a he­li­copter crashed in Ta­man Melawati, Malaysia’s Se­lan­gor state, after col­lid­ing with an­other he­li­copter in mid-air yes­ter­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>It is l earnt that the air­craft crashed in a field near a school.</p>
    <p>Am­pang Jaya po­lice dis­trict as­sis­tant com­mis­sioner Mo­hamad Farouk Esha named the two men who were killed as Mr Mo­hamed Sabri Ba­harom, 56, and Mr Mohd Ir­fan Fikri Mo­hamed Rawi, 44.</p>
    <p>He also con­firmed that two peo­ple in the other he­li­copter were for­mer Malaysia Air­lines group chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Ah­mad Jauhari Yahya and 51-year-old Tan Chai Eian. Both sur­vived the in­ci­dent as the he­li­copter they were in man­aged to land safely near the school.</p>
    <p>“It was so lucky that none of it hit the houses be­cause it is a well pop­u­lated area and it landed so close to it. I ac­tu­ally didn’t ex­pect there to be any deaths,” a Ta­man Melawati res­i­dent who did not want to be named told The Star.</p>
    <p>Both he­li­copters are be­lieved to have left from Sul­tan Ab­dul Aziz Shah Air­port in Subang at about 11am. The col­li­sion oc­curred about 20 min­utes into the flight.</p>
    <p>ACP Mo­hamad Farouk said the two he­li­copters were from the same com­pany.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve they were from Subang, head­ing to Gent­ing Sem­pah,” he said. “We are in­ves­ti­gat­ing the cause of death, while the in­ves­ti­ga­tion on the ac­ci­dent and crash will be con­ducted by the Depart­ment of Civil Avi­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Wee Ka Siong said in a state­ment that the two G2CA he­li­copters had been in­volved in a flight train­ing ses­sion with four crew mem­bers.</p>
    <p>The Kuala Lumpur Aero­nau­ti­cal Res­cue Co­or­di­na­tion Cen­tre had been ac­ti­vated to pro­vide all nec­es­sary res­cue co­or­di­na­tion ef­forts, Datuk Seri Wee added in the state­ment.</p>
    <p>A tech­ni­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tion has been ini­ti­ated by the Min­istry of Trans­port’s Air Ac­ci­dent In­ves­ti­ga­tion Bureau to de­ter­mine the cir­cum­stances and cause of the ac­ci­dent with an aim to safe­guard lives and pre­vent fu­ture ac­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>“In this re­gard, the in­ves­ti­ga­tion to be ini­ti­ated is not to ap­por­tion blame or li­a­bil­ity,” Dr Wee said in the state­ment. The ini­tial in­ves­ti­ga­tion re­port is ex­pected to be ready in 30 days.</p>
    <p>Gom­bak MP Azmin Ali, who ar­rived at the scene after he was in­formed of the crash, said: “We hope the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties such as the Fire and Res­cue Depart­ment as well as the po­lice can in­ves­ti­gate the mat­ter thor­oughly.”</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Azmin, who is also Se­nior Min­is­ter for the Econ­omy and Min­is­ter of In­ter­na­tional Trade and In­dus­try, added: “We will wait for more in­for­ma­tion as the in­ves­ti­ga­tion con­tin­ues.”</p>
