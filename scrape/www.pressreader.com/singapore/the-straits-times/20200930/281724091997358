    <p>Ngee Ann City in Or­chard Road, Orchis Food Court in Changi Air­port Ter­mi­nal 1 and Alexan­dra Vil­lage Food Cen­tre are among new places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were in­fec­tious, said the Health Min­istry yesterday.</p>
    <p>Be­tween Sept 15 and 25, the Orchis Food Court was vis­ited at six dif­fer­ent time slots, while the Alexan­dra Vil­lage Food Cen­tre was vis­ited at four sep­a­rate time slots.</p>
    <p>Pop­u­lar venues I MM, Bugis Junc­tion and Bugis+ were also listed as new lo­ca­tions vis­ited by pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the full list of lo­ca­tions that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes and the times they vis­ited them, to get peo­ple who were at those places at the same time to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>Close con­tacts would have been no­ti­fied and there is no need to avoid th­ese places as they would have been cleaned, if nec­es­sary, it said.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 27 new coro­n­avirus cases were con­firmed yesterday, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,742.</p>
    <p>There was one com­mu­nity case who is a Malaysian work per­mit holder.</p>
    <p>There were also nine im­ported cases, com­pris­ing one Sin­ga­porean, five per­ma­nent res­i­dents, one work pass holder, one work per­mit holder and one de­pen­dant’s pass holder.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean and the work per­mit holder re­turned to Sin­ga­pore from In­done­sia, while the rest of the im­ported cases were re­turn­ing from In­dia.</p>
    <p>All the im­ported cases ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore be­tween Sept 16 and 18, and were placed on stay-home no­tice on ar­rival in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 17 of the 27 new coro­n­avirus pa­tients an­nounced yesterday.</p>
    <p>Eight had been iden­ti­fied ear­lier as con­tacts of pre­vi­ous cases, and had been quar­an­tined to pre­vent fur­ther trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing nine cases were de­tected through sur­veil­lance test­ing.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one case a day in the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one case a day in the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 73 cases dis­charged yesterday, 57,451 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 32 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 217 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
