    <p>No other fam­ily has dom­i­nated pop cul­ture and head­lines in the past decade quite like Amer­ica’s first fam­ily of re­al­ity tele­vi­sion, the Kar­dashi­ans.</p>
    <p>But af­ter 14 years and 20 sea­sons on air, it re­cently an­nounced that Keep­ing Up With The Kar­dashi­ans is com­ing to a close, with the fi­nal sea­son air­ing at the start of next year.</p>
    <p>Keep­ing Up With The Kar­dashi­ans is show­ing on stream­ing ser­vice hayu at hayu.com or via its app.</p>
    <p>The show has turned its sub­jects into some of the most fa­mous peo­ple on earth – namely, the five sis­ters who an­chor the show: Kim, Kourt­ney and Khloe Kar­dashian, and their half-sis­ters Ken­dall and Kylie Jen­ner.</p>
    <p>“This show made us who we are and I will be for­ever in debt to ev­ery­one who played a role in shap­ing our ca­reers and chang­ing our lives for­ever,” wrote Kim Kar­dashian in an In­sta­gram post an­nounc­ing the show’s end.</p>
    <p>From high jinks while on hol­i­day in ex­otic des­ti­na­tions such as Bora Bora to ma­jor fam­ily mile­stones like wed­dings, di­vorces and births, The Straits Times looks back at the show’s most mem­o­rable mo­ments.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>KOURT­NEY GIVES BIRTH</p>
    <p>When: Sea­son 4, episode 10</p>
    <p>What: El­dest sis­ter Kourt­ney was the first sib­ling to have a child, with then-part­ner Scott Disick – and she did it on cam­era.</p>
    <p>Nearly all her sis­ters were present as she gave birth to now 10-year-old Ma­son in 2009.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing labour, she even reached down and pulled the baby out her­self.</p>
    <p>She did the same for her sec­ond child Pene­lope, who was born in 2012.</p>
    <p>The birth of their third child Reign, in 2014, was not tele­vised. What Khloe said: “Kourt­ney just loves to pull out her own chil­dren.”</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>KIM GETS HYS­TER­I­CAL OVER LOST EAR­RING</p>
    <p>When: Sea­son 6, episode 12</p>
    <p>What: While on their an­nual fam­ily va­ca­tion – in Bora Bora with Kim’s then-boyfriend Kris Humphries – things took a dra­matic turn when he threw her into the ocean, re­sult­ing in the loss of her US$75,000 (S$102,000) di­a­mond ear­ring.</p>
    <p>She cried hys­ter­i­cally to her mother Kris Jen­ner, who re­as­sures her that ev­ery­thing is go­ing to be okay.</p>
    <p>Youngest sis­ter Kylie even­tu­ally found the ear­ring.</p>
    <p>What Kourt­ney said: “Kim, there’s peo­ple that are dy­ing.”</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>KHLOE GOES TO JAIL WHILE KIM TAKES SELF­IES</p>
    <p>When: Sea­son 3, episode 1</p>
    <p>What: Mum/man­ager Kris and Kim ac­com­pa­nied Khloe as she went to jail for vi­o­lat­ing pro­ba­tion from her ar­rest for driv­ing un­der the in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>Big sis­ter Kim de­cided to chron­i­cle the jour­ney by tak­ing self­ies and we­fies.</p>
    <p>She later re­leased the pho­tos she took on her web­site in 2016, with the cap­tion: “Had to share them with you guys be­cause they are SO funny and I still can’t be­lieve this hap­pened. Good thing I took some self­ies to doc­u­ment the mo­ment.” What Kris said: “Kim, would you stop tak­ing pic­tures of your­self? Your sis­ter’s go­ing to jail.”</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>KIM’S BUTT X-RAY</p>
    <p>When: Sea­son 6, episode 3</p>
    <p>What: Kim’s con­tro­ver­sial bum had been the sub­ject of much speculatio­n: au na­turel or the re­sult of cos­metic surgery?</p>
    <p>In 2011, she dealt with the ru­mours by getting her butt scanned with an X-ray ma­chine, af­ter a dare from Kourt­ney and Khloe.</p>
    <p>Her scan was com­pared with one of Khloe’s sil­i­cone breast im­plants, show­ing there was no sil­i­cone in Kim’s butt.</p>
    <p>She re­port­edly got her fa­mous der­riere in­sured for a jaw-drop­ping US$21 mil­lion in 2014.</p>
    <p>What Kim said: “The whole world has been doubt­ing me – this is the best thing I could’ve done.”</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>KRIS AT KIM’S PLAY­BOY SHOOT</p>
    <p>When: Sea­son 1, episode 4</p>
    <p>What: Kris con­vinced Kim to pose for a nude Play­boy shoot, right af­ter Kim’s sex-tape scan­dal.</p>
    <p>At the shoot, Kris snapped a few pho­tos while en­cour­ag­ing Kim from the side­lines.</p>
    <p>What Kris said as Kim posed in pearls and noth­ing else: “You’re do­ing amaz­ing, sweetie.”</p>
    <p>6</p>
    <p>KRIS MEETS CAIT­LYN JEN­NER</p>
    <p>When: Sea­son 11, episode 4</p>
    <p>What: Kris met her for­mer hus­band and Olympian Bruce Jen­ner to ad­dress the ten­sion be­tween them, fol­low­ing Bruce’s very pub­lic gen­der tran­si­tion to Cait­lyn.</p>
    <p>Things turned sour af­ter Cait­lyn gave an in­ter­view to Van­ity Fair in 2015, in which she blamed Kris for the break­down of their 25-year mar­riage and said Kris knew all along about her de­sire to be a woman.</p>
    <p>What Kris said about Cait­lyn: “But I’ve got to hand it to her – she looks great.”</p>
    <p>7</p>
    <p>TRIS­TAN CHEATS ON KHLOE DAYS BE­FORE SHE GIVES BIRTH</p>
    <p>When: Sea­son 15, episode 12</p>
    <p>As a preg­nant Khloe neared her due date, sev­eral gos­sip blogs pub­lished re­ports of her bas­ket­ball player boyfriend Tris­tan Thomp­son cheat­ing on her.</p>
    <p>Her fam­ily rushed to be with her in Cleve­land, where Thomp­son was present for the birth of their daugh­ter, True.</p>
    <p>But things were a lit­tle awk­ward in the de­liv­ery room, with her fam­ily tak­ing it out on him in their on-cam­era in­ter­views in­stead. What Khloe said to Kim: “Are you go­ing to say ‘hi’ to each other or no?”</p>
    <p>8</p>
    <p>KIM’S FAIRY-TALE WED­DING AND “CRY FACE”</p>
    <p>When: Sea­son 6, episodes 14 and 15 What: Within a year, Kim went from dat­ing bas­ket­ball player Humphries to a two-episode tele­vised wed­ding to di­vorc­ing him af­ter just 72 days of mar­riage.</p>
    <p>But trust the Kar­dashi­ans to cap­i­talise on ev­ery­thing. The tearstreak­ed im­age of Kim in a white robe (above) be­came Ki­moji (Kim’s emoji app) cry-face art, splashed on ev­ery­thing from phone cov­ers to sweat­shirts to wrap­ping pa­per. What Kim said: “I in­vited all these peo­ple to this huge wed­ding and flew ev­ery­one out, wasted ev­ery­one’s time and ev­ery­one’s money, ev­ery­one’s ev­ery­thing and I feel bad.”</p>
