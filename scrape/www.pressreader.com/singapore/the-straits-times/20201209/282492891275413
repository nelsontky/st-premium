    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK Health-con­scious con­sumers are eat­ing avo­ca­dos like never be­fore dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>After a brief drop in de­mand for the fruit at the start of the Covid-19 cri­sis, con­sump­tion of avo­ca­dos in Europe and the United States is now hit­ting record highs, ac­cord­ing to Mr Xavier Equi­hua, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of the World Avo­cado Or­gan­i­sa­tion, a trade group.</p>
    <p>“Con­sump­tion is off the charts,” he said in an in­ter­view from Cal­i­for­nia. “Peo­ple want to eat healthy. The new lux­ury post-pan­demic is go­ing to be eat­ing healthy, and well­ness. Even the fash­ion in­dus­try is say­ing that.”</p>
    <p>De­mand for the fruit has risen as more con­sumers eat at home.</p>
    <p>No longer just a com­po­nent of gua­camole for par­ties, its use has broad­ened to sal­ads, bur­ri­tos and, of course, the hip­ster cliche of avo­cado toast.</p>
    <p>Europe’s con­sump­tion will jump 12 per cent this year to a record 671 mil­lion kg, ac­cord­ing to im­port data, while US de­mand will in­crease 7 per cent, Mr Equi­hua said, cit­ing in­dus­try pro­jec­tions.</p>
    <p>“It’s not only the mil­len­ni­als,” he said. “They are now hav­ing kids and they are eat­ing avo­cado too. Gen Z also wants healthy food. We’re go­ing to see a fur­ther ex­plo­sion in the next six to eight years” when Europe may catch up to the top-con­sum­ing Amer­i­cans, he said.</p>
    <p>The value of global avo­cado im­ports grew the fastest among main fruit over the past decade, ac­cord­ing to Mr David Ma­gana, se­nior an­a­lyst for Rabobank In­ter­na­tional. Global de­mand for Hass, the most pop­u­lar va­ri­ety, will grow at an an­nual rate of al­most 5 per cent through 2025, top­ping US$8 bil­lion (S$10.7 bil­lion) glob­ally, the Hass Avo­cado Board pro­jects.</p>
    <p>Luck­ily for con­sumers, bumper crops in Mex­ico and Cal­i­for­nia, the top sup­pli­ers to the Amer­i­can mar­ket, brought prices down this year after a sup­ply dis­rup­tion last year sent prices to record highs,</p>
    <p>Mr Ma­gana said. From 2010 to 2018, world out­put rose from 2.87 mil­lion tonnes to 6.4 mil­lion, with planted area nearly tripling, ac­cord­ing to data from the United Na­tions’ Food and Agri­cul­ture Or­gan­i­sa­tion, which ex­cludes Chile, an im­por­tant pro­ducer.</p>
    <p>While lower prices have helped de­mand, US mar­ket pen­e­tra­tion has room to grow, ac­cord­ing to Mr Equi­hua. The av­er­age Amer­i­can eats 3.6kg a year, com­pared with Mex­ico’s 9kg, he said.</p>
    <p>One of the main chal­lenges for the in­dus­try re­mains to en­sure that sup­ply keeps up with de­mand, to avoid a surge in prices, while also ad­dress­ing crit­i­cism that some coun­tries are ex­pand­ing pro­duc­tion us­ing non-sus­tain­able prac­tices for the en­vi­ron­ment, he said.</p>
    <p>“We’re just scratch­ing the sur­face in Europe, China and other parts of Asia and South-east Asia,” said Mr Steve Barnard, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Mis­sion Pro­duce, the world’s largest sup­plier, which owns pack­ing fa­cil­i­ties and grows fruit as well.</p>
    <p>“In­dia is start­ing to ex­plore avo­cado con­sump­tion and based on the pop­u­la­tion in those ar­eas, the ex­pan­sion and de­mand has huge op­por­tu­nity for growth.”</p>
    <p>To se­cure avo­ca­dos year-round, the Cal­i­for­nia-based com­pany has been in­vest­ing in coun­tries such as Gu­atemala and Peru. Europe “presents a great op­por­tu­nity and is one of the rea­sons to be in Gu­atemala” to sup­port ex­pan­sion, he said.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s an­nual sales more than dou­bled over the past five years, which gives Mr Barnard rea­son to be bullish even on China, where chal­lenges re­main.</p>
    <p>The com­pany en­tered a part­ner­ship with a lo­cal im­porter and a fruit re­tailer, and their Mr Avo­cado ven­ture is the first and only sup­plier of ripe avo­ca­dos in the Asian gi­ant.</p>
    <p>“Chi­nese con­sumers are at­tracted to the health ben­e­fits,” Mr Barnard said.</p>
    <p>“Right now, China thinks of avo­ca­dos as a smoothie and baby­food in­gre­di­ent, whereas the US thinks of avo­cado toast and gua­camole, so as the coun­try con­tin­ues to gain ac­cess and fa­mil­iarise them­selves with the fruit, con­sump­tion will con­tinue to grow.”</p>
