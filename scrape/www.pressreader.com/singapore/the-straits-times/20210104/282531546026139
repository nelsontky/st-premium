    <p>LON­DON Andy Car­roll scored not just a first Pre­mier League goal for New­cas­tle since Box­ing Day in 2010 but his first top-flight strike since play­ing for West Ham in 2017-18.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it was not enough for the hosts as Le­ices­ter moved up to third place in the Pre­mier League, just a point be­hind Manch­ester United (33), who also have a game in hand. Sec­ond-half goals by James Mad­di­son and Youri Tiele­mans se­cured a 2-1 vic­tory at St James’ Park yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>While Car­roll’s late strike set up a tense fi­nale, Le­ices­ter were wor­thy win­ners – their eighth league win this term af­ter tak­ing the lead.</p>
    <p>Mad­di­son blasted Le­ices­ter in front in the 55th minute, and the out­stand­ing Bel­gian Tiele­mans pro­duced a great fin­ish to dou­ble the lead af­ter 72 min­utes to seal the Foxes’ sev­enth away win in the league this sea­son.</p>
    <p>Eng­land mid­fielder Mad­di­son told re­porters af­ter­wards: “We re­ally like it here to be hon­est, we’ve got a re­ally good record here.</p>
    <p>“New­cas­tle made it dif­fi­cult for the last 10 min­utes but we got there in the end. If I was a neu­tral, I might have switched over to the other side at half-time.</p>
    <p>“It was just a case of be­ing pa­tient. It was this time last year that we started to peel off. It’s im­por­tant we learn from last year, and come to places like this and play like a big team.”</p>
    <p>On his darts cel­e­bra­tion, Mad­di­son added that the team had been en­thralled by the on­go­ing PDC World Darts Cham­pi­onship, with the fi­nal end­ing late yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Le­ices­ter boss Bren­dan Rodgers was just as thrilled. “I’m de­lighted with that. It was al­ways go­ing to be a tight game. We had some re­ally good mo­ments in first half but just failed with that fi­nal ball,” he said.</p>
    <p>“In the sec­ond half we stayed strong de­fen­sively. Once we got the first goal, it opened a lit­tle bit.</p>
    <p>“It be­came a war in the last 10 min­utes. We needed to be a lit­tle bit more ex­plo­sive in the sec­ond half with our speed. They showed re­ally good ca­pa­bil­i­ties in the game.</p>
    <p>“There is still a long way to go but it’s a great start for us.”</p>
    <p>Un­like Le­ices­ter, New­cas­tle have not been hit­ting the mark for the past month.</p>
    <p>Since a mass Covid-19 out­break in late Novem­ber prompted the post­pone­ment of the first Pre­mier League game of the sea­son – at As­ton Villa early last month – things have pro­gres­sively got­ten worse for Steve Bruce’s side.</p>
    <p>They lost cap­tain Ja­maal Las­celles and Al­lan Saint-Max­imin to the “long term” ef­fects of the coro­n­avirus – both have yet to re­turn since – and have taken just five points from a pos­si­ble 18 in the league, slip­ping to 15th place.</p>
    <p>Calls are grow­ing louder for Bruce to be sacked, but Caroll felt his team were still un­lucky here, in­sist­ing “we de­served some­thing”.</p>
