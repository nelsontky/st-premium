    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Olivia de Hav­il­land, an ac­tress who gained movie im­mor­tal­ity i n Gone With The Wind (1939), then built an il­lus­tri­ous film ca­reer punc­tu­ated by a suc­cess­ful fight to loosen stu­dios’ grip on con­tract ac­tors, died on Sun­day at her home in Paris. She was 104 and one of the last sur­viv­ing stars of Hol­ly­wood’s fa­bled Golden Age.</p>
    <p>Her death was con­firmed by her pub­li­cist Lisa Gold­berg.</p>
    <p>Although she was type­cast early in her ca­reer as t he de­mure in­genue, she went on to earn meatier roles that led to five Acad­emy Award nom­i­na­tions, two of which brought her the Best Ac­tress Os­car, for To Each His Own (1946) and The Heiress (1949).</p>
    <p>Those roles came to her in no small part be­cause of the re­solve she showed when she stood up to the stu­dios and won a bat­tle that helped push Hol­ly­wood into the mod­ern era.</p>
    <p>She had shown sim­i­lar grit a decade ear­lier, in her break­through role, when she held her own against her for­mi­da­ble co-stars – Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh and Les­lie Howard – in Gone With The Wind as Me­lanie Hamil­ton Wilkes.</p>
    <p>The 1939 Civil War epic was briefly pulled from the HBO Max stream­ing ser­vice last month and re­turned with an in­tro­duc­tion say­ing the film presents the Ge­or­gia plan­ta­tion at its cen­tre as “a world of grace and beauty, with­out ac­knowl­edg­ing the bru­tal­i­ties of the sys­tem of chat­tel slav­ery upon which this world is based”.</p>
    <p>As Me­lanie Hamil­ton Wilkes, the fi­ancee and then wife of Howard’s Ash­ley Wilkes, she brought in­tel­li­gence and grace to her por­trait of a woman whose shy, for­giv­ing, al­most too kindly na­ture stood in sharp con­trast to the of­ten ven­omous jeal­ousy of her high-spir­ited sis­ter-in-law, Scar­lett O’Hara (Leigh).</p>
    <p>De Hav­il­land’s per­for­mance led to an Os­car nom­i­na­tion as Best Sup­port­ing Ac­tress, though the award went to an­other mem­ber of the cast, Hat­tie Mc­Daniel, who played Mammy, Scar­lett’s house­keeper. Leigh won in the Best Ac­tress cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>Warner had signed de Hav­il­land to a seven-year con­tract in 1935. Af­ter her suc­cess in Gone With The Wind, de Hav­il­land ex­pected more chal­leng­ing roles. For the most part, they did not ma­te­ri­alise.</p>
    <p>One ex­cep­tion was Hold Back The Dawn (1941). Her per­for­mance earned her an­other Os­car nom­i­na­tion, but this time, she lost to her sis­ter Joan Fon­taine, who won for Sus­pi­cion (1941).</p>
    <p>The two were rarely on speak­ing terms af­ter that. They are the only sis­ters to win Best Ac­tress Acad­emy Awards, and their sib­ling ri­valry was called the fiercest in Hol­ly­wood his­tory.</p>
    <p>The for­mula roles kept com­ing. When de Hav­il­land com­plained, she was told that she had been hired be­cause she pho­tographed well and that she was not re­quired to act.</p>
    <p>She be­gan to refuse roles she con­sid­ered in­fe­rior. Warner re­tal­i­ated by sus­pend­ing her sev­eral times, for a to­tal of six months and, af­ter her con­tract ex­pired, in­sist­ing that be­cause of the sus­pen­sions, she was still the stu­dio’s prop­erty for six more months.</p>
    <p>De Hav­il­land sued. The case dragged on for 11/ years, but the</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia Supreme Court up­held a lower-court rul­ing in her favour in 1945. What be­came known as the de Hav­il­land de­ci­sion estab­lished that a stu­dio could not ar­bi­trar­ily ex­tend the du­ra­tion of an ac­tor’s con­tract.</p>
    <p>But she did not love Hol­ly­wood and, in the 1950s, she aban­doned it to live in Paris with a new hus­band, though she kept her Amer­i­can ci­ti­zen­ship.</p>
    <p>Olivia Mary de Hav­il­land was born on July 1, 1916, and was mar­ried twice. Both mar­riages ended in divorce.</p>
    <p>The first, in 1946, was to Mar­cus Aurelius Goodrich, a Texas-born nov­el­ist, screen­writer and jour­nal­ist. They had a son, Ben­jamin, and di­vorced in 1952.</p>
    <p>She mar­ried Pierre Galante, the au­thor of mil­i­tary his­to­ries and, at one point, ed­i­tor of the mag­a­zine Paris Match, in 1955 af­ter the cou­ple met in France. They moved to</p>
    <p>Paris, had a daugh­ter, Gisele, and di­vorced in 1979. De Hav­il­land’s son died of Hodgkin’s dis­ease in 1991.</p>
    <p>She is sur­vived by her daugh­ter, Giselle Galante Chu­lack. Fon­taine died in 2013 at 96.</p>
    <p>From the mid-1960s, de Hav­il­land’s act­ing was largely con­fined to spo­radic roles in tele­vi­sion se­ries.</p>
    <p>In 1965, she be­came the first woman to head the j ury at the Cannes Film Fes­ti­val. She re­turned to feature films only oc­ca­sion­ally, among them the hugely suc­cess­ful 1977 dis­as­ter movie Air­port ’77 and her last Hol­ly­wood film, The Fifth Mus­ke­teer (1979).</p>
    <p>In 2010, Mr Ni­co­las Sarkozy, then the Pres­i­dent of France, awarded her the Le­gion d’Hon­neur.</p>
    <p>In 1999, she was hon­oured with a party in Paris to cel­e­brate the 60th an­niver­sary of Gone With The Wind.</p>
