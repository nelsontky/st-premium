    <p>FAM­ILY PHYSI­CIAN JEREMY CHAN, on the Doc­torxDen­tist web­site, which pro­files med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als and al­lows pur­ported pa­tients to re­view the doc­tors.</p>
    <p>A war of at­tri­tion over the right to list and pro­file med­i­cal prac­ti­tion­ers in Sin­ga­pore on a web­site run by a start-up has snow­balled, with hun­dreds of doc­tors want­ing to be dis­as­so­ci­ated from it.</p>
    <p>They have taken is­sue with the Doc­torxDen­tist (DxD) web­site, which pro­files med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als, al­lows pur­ported pa­tients to re­view the doc­tors and fa­cil­i­tates ap­point­ments. It also of­fers cost es­ti­mates for con­sul­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>It started with a group of doc­tors who say they did not give per­mis­sion to the site to use pho­tos and de­tails from their own web­sites to be copied and used on DxD. They also dis­pute the re­views, say­ing there is no way to ver­ify if the pa­tients are real.</p>
    <p>The doc­tors say de­spite their re­peated re­quests to re­move their de­tails from the site, DxD re­fused.</p>
    <p>Last week, the Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion (SMA) sent an email to its mem­bers, ask­ing them to in­di­cate if they wished to have their pro­files re­moved from the on­line plat­form. This list will be made pub­lic on the SMA web­site if DxD re­fuses to delist the names of doc­tors who want to opt out. More than 700 doc­tors told SMA they want out of the site.</p>
    <p>DxD’s gen­eral man­ager Tyr As­taroth Ding said lawyers had ad­vised the com­pany to “au­to­mat­i­cally list all doc­tors on our plat­form us­ing the Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal Coun­cil (SMC) di­rec­tory to re­tain an un­bi­ased and com­pre­hen­sive list­ing for our read­ers”.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing a query from SMA, SMC said on Thurs­day that it had not given per­mis­sion to DxD to “use, re­pro­duce or ap­pro­pri­ate the com­ments found on the on­line med­i­cal reg­is­ter on the SMC web­site, and nei­ther has the SMC re­ceived any re­quest from DxD for per­mis­sion to ex­tract the data for use on their web­site”.</p>
    <p>SMA told its mem­bers that SMC will be re­quest­ing that DxD re­frain from us­ing in­for­ma­tion ob­tained from SMC’s web­site.</p>
    <p>SMA first vice-pres­i­dent Ng Chee Kwan said: “Doc­tors do not have con­trol over how they are ac­tu­ally por­trayed, es­pe­cially for tes­ti­mo­ni­als, which are a con­cern be­cause as pro­fes­sion­als, we are obliged to re­tain con­trol over how we are por­trayed in any form of ad­ver­tis­ing.”</p>
    <p>The Medicines (Ad­ver­tise­ment and Sale) Act pro­hibits the ad­ver­tis­ing of any skills or ser­vices re­lat­ing to the treat­ment of any diseases or med­i­cal con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Dr Ng added that doc­tors are also con­cerned that they are un­able to as­cer­tain if the tes­ti­mo­ni­als are writ­ten by real pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Ms Ding con­firmed that the com­pany helps doc­tors create con­tent on the plat­form that will op­ti­mise searches on Google. The av­er­age cost is $7,000.</p>
    <p>DxD said it has around 5,200 list­ings of doc­tors in pri­vate prac­tice on its web­site and is ac­tively work­ing with around 500 doc­tors.</p>
    <p>The site de­scribes it­self as a “free Ques­tion and An­swer plat­form where con­tribut­ing doc­tors an­swer all your health ques­tions”.</p>
    <p>Car­di­ol­o­gist Chuang HsuanHung, whose pro­file was re­moved from DxD at his re­quest, said the site has not sought doc­tors’ con­sent to rep­re­sent them. “The sacro­sanct re­la­tion­ship be­tween doc­tors and pa­tients should not be com­mer­cialised.”</p>
    <p>On the plat­form, some pa­tients post pho­tos of their prob­lems or med­i­cal re­sults to get an­other opin­ion. But doc­tors say pa­tients may not be aware that they are post­ing sen­si­tive in­for­ma­tion on­line.</p>
    <p>“The way to build trust is to pro­tect a pa­tient’s con­fi­den­tial­ity, and if an or­gan­i­sa­tion like DxD comes into the pic­ture and does not have the same think­ing, the trust that the health­care pro­fes­sion needs to sus­tain it­self will be com­pro­mised,” said fam­ily physi­cian Jeremy Chan.</p>
    <p>He said the site of­fered ap­point­ment slots even for times when his clinic is closed. “If they are al­ready mis­han­dling our data, what other data are they not han­dling prop­erly? This is prob­a­bly what’s on doc­tors’ minds. You get very fear­ful be­cause you don’t know what they are do­ing.”</p>
    <p>DxD’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Tristan Hah­ner, a Ger­man soft­ware en­gi­neer, said the site has started to “tem­porar­ily re­move” the pro­files of around 200 doc­tors who made the re­quest in writ­ing to DxD.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a vir­tual meet­ing yes­ter­day with rep­re­sen­ta­tives from SMA, SMC and the Min­istry of Health, DxD said it will re­pub­lish pro­files, but will of­fer doc­tors the chance to opt out of pa­tient re­views.</p>
