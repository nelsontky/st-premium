    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den has en­tered the fi­nal stage of his de­lib­er­a­tions about choos­ing a run­ning mate as he pre­pares to talk one-on-one with the fi­nal­ists, while Demo­cratic lead­ers lobby him fu­ri­ously to el­e­vate their al­lies and sink their en­e­mies.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s cam­paign has con­ducted ex­ten­sive polling and fo­cus groups with vot­ers on a col­lec­tion of can­di­dates and weighed var­i­ous fac­tors, such as the im­pact of the pick in bat­tle­ground states and whether to choose a black woman.</p>
    <p>Aides said the an­nounce­ment will come the week before the Demo­cratic con­ven­tion later this month.</p>
    <p>Two can­di­dates who re­ceived scant at­ten­tion early in the process are now among the lead­ing con­tenders: Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Karen Bass of Cal­i­for­nia and for­mer na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser Su­san Rice, according to Demo­cratic of­fi­cials briefed on the se­lec­tion process.</p>
    <p>Ms Bass has moved rapidly to­wards the top of Mr Bi­den’s list amid an in­ten­sive lob­by­ing drive by her fel­low House Democrats and has im­pressed the for­mer vice-pres­i­dent’s search com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den is said to be fo­cused on find­ing a run­ning mate he re­gards as ca­pa­ble of ad­vanc­ing his pri­or­i­ties in gov­ern­ing and who can be counted on not to stray from the ur­gent chal­lenges fac­ing the na­tion to pur­sue her own po­lit­i­cal pri­or­i­ties, according to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with his think­ing.</p>
    <p>His ad­vis­ers would also pre­fer a run­ning mate who would not present a rich po­lit­i­cal tar­get for Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, given that the in­cum­bent is lag­ging badly in the polls and has so far strug­gled to de­liver cred­i­ble neg­a­tive at­tacks against Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>In con­ver­sa­tions with Mr Bi­den and his vet­ting com­mit­tee, law­mak­ers have rec­om­mended Ms Bass as a con­sen­sus can­di­date who is well liked across par­ti­san and fac­tional lines and would be a loyal lieu­tenant to him in gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Ms Bass has re­in­forced that mes­sage by as­sur­ing Demo­cratic of­fi­cials she has no in­ter­est in seek­ing the pres­i­dency her­self, said a party in­sider. Such com­mit­ment could as­suage con­cerns in the Bi­den camp that he might be over­shad­owed by a run­ning mate po­si­tion­ing her­self to suc­ceed him.</p>
    <p>Ms Bass has also waged a pre­vi­ously undis­closed cam­paign to woo in­flu­en­tial lib­eral lead­ers, phon­ing union pres­i­dents to seek their coun­sel and support.</p>
    <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is close to Ms Bass, whom she named to over­see the re­cent polic­ing re­form Bill, and has made her ad­mi­ra­tion clear in pri­vate con­ver­sa­tions, in­clud­ing with for­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama, although her aides said she has not con­veyed support for any can­di­date.</p>
    <p>Two prom­i­nent Democrats, Sen­a­tors El­iz­a­beth Warren of Mas­sachusetts and Ka­mala Har­ris of Cal­i­for­nia, along with a hand­ful of other women, re­main as pos­si­bil­i­ties; both law­mak­ers have the statewide po­lit­i­cal ex­pe­ri­ence and large na­tional fol­low­ings that Ms Bass and Ms Rice lack.</p>
    <p>Ms Warren has be­come something of an in­for­mal ad­viser to Mr Bi­den on eco­nomic is­sues and has won support from her party’s pro­gres­sive wing. Ms Har­ris is re­garded as a mus­cu­lar fundraiser with the back­ing of im­por­tant peo­ple in the Demo­cratic Party’s donor class.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s de­ci­sion has be­come both enor­mously con­se­quen­tial and highly del­i­cate be­cause of the un­re­solved ques­tion of whether, should he win in Novem­ber, he would seek re-elec­tion in four years, when he would be nearly 82 years old.</p>
    <p>Some of his top ad­vis­ers, how­ever, are warn­ing against tap­ping some­body who would im­me­di­ately be­gin eye­ing the next Demo­cratic primary.</p>
    <p>“There’s going to be an aw­ful lot to do start­ing on Day 1, so I think it’s im­por­tant to have some­body who can be fo­cused on that task and not run­ning for pres­i­dent as soon as we fin­ish the in­au­gu­ra­tion,” said Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Cedric Rich­mond of Louisiana, one of Mr Bi­den’s cam­paign chairs.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den is also fac­ing the most in­tense lob­by­ing to choose a black run­ning mate.</p>
    <p>A small group of strate­gists and ac­tivists who have been press­ing for a black woman re­cently spoke about the shift­ing po­lit­i­cal en­vi­ron­ment – in the wake of the death of Mr Ge­orge Floyd, an un­armed black man who died in po­lice cus­tody in Min­neapo­lis – in a meet­ing with mem­bers of the search com­mit­tee, according to party in­sid­ers.</p>
    <p>Many of them in­di­cated their support for Ms Har­ris and Ms Rice.</p>
    <p>But the meet­ing was held before it was ev­i­dent how se­ri­ously Ms Bass was be­ing con­sid­ered. Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Ro Khanna of Cal­i­for­nia said: “She’d be a pick that ev­ery part of the Demo­cratic coali­tion would re­spect and be ex­cited about.”</p>
