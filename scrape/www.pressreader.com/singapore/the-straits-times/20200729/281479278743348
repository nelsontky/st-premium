    <p>Food­ies look­ing for­ward to chef Pang Kok Keong’s hawker fare can check out his Pang’s Hakka Noo­dles stall, which opened on Mon­day at the new Xin Tekka food hall.</p>
    <p>It is lo­cated at Tekka Place at the junc­tion of Seran­goon Road and Sungei Road.</p>
    <p>The chef-owner of the de­funct An­toinette had re­vealed that he would be open­ing the stall when he an­nounced the clos­ing of his French patis­serie cum bistro last month. He pre­vi­ously ran a pop-up sell­ing Hakka dishes from the restau­rant.</p>
    <p>The op­er­a­tor be­hind Xin Tekka,</p>
    <p>Mr An­drew Tan, calls it a new “hy­brid model” food­court, which charges dif­fer­ent ren­tal rates to fit the needs of tenants.</p>
    <p>He says the $2,500 to $4,500 monthly rates, which in­clude air­con­di­tion­ing and clean­ing services, are lower than other food­courts in town. He also of­fers in­cu­ba­tor pro­grammes for bud­ding stall-hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan is also a share­holder of the Eat@ Seven clus­ter of Ja­panese eater­ies at Sun­tec City and runs an on­line busi­ness im­port­ing Ja­panese food.</p>
    <p>Xin Tekka spans about 10,000 sq ft and takes up two floors of Tekka Place. It has a seat­ing ca­pac­ity of 180, now down to 130 to meet so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>It fea­tures nine stalls on the ground floor, a mix of new con­cepts like Pang’s, come­back brands like Casa Bom Vento Ex­press, well­known hawk­ers like Al­ham­bra Satay and new­bies like home-based Malay snack seller Da Boomz De­lights.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond floor, which will have two stalls sell­ing wine and beer, is not open yet.</p>
    <p>Pang says he chose to open his noo­dle stall in Xin Tekka be­cause he likes the con­cept of colour­ful stalls laid out in an ir­reg­u­lar fash­ion dif­fer­ent from stan­dard food­courts.</p>
    <p>He adds: “And many of the tenants the land­lord cu­rated have some kind of his­tory, so we are in good com­pany.”</p>
    <p>He was also at­tracted by the fact that the build­ing has bays for coaches, which will help to bring in tourists – though the Covid-19 pan­demic has scut­tled those plans.</p>
    <p>His menu of­fers tra­di­tional Hakka flat noo­dles topped with a minced pork sauce for $7 and in­cludes a bowl of yong tau foo soup. He also sells Hakka wings ($4 for two chicken wings), which is adapted from deep-fried pork belly mar­i­nated in red fer­mented bean­curd.</p>
    <p>He plans to add more dishes like red wine chicken later.</p>
    <p>Mr Lionel Chee closed his Casa Bom Vento restau­rant in Joo Chiat Road five years ago af­ter 20 years be­cause he felt din­ers were mov­ing out of East Coast to the town area. It was known for Eurasian and</p>
    <p>Per­anakan dishes like curry devil and itik tim.</p>
    <p>He chose Xin Tekka for his come­back be­cause he saw that the area was packed with lo­cals and tourists pre-pan­demic. An­other at­trac­tion was the Tekka wet mar­ket across the road.</p>
    <p>“If I run out of in­gre­di­ents, I can just walk over to buy them,” he says.</p>
    <p>He of­fers a small menu of about nine dishes such as blue pea nasi ulam with tofu satay ($8.20) and Ny­onya dry laksa ($8.20) for walkin cus­tomers, but has a reper­toire of more than 20 dishes for pre-or­ders. Th­ese in­clude fish head curry ($38) and chicken pongtey ($7.70).</p>
    <p>Ms War­dah Anuar of Da Boomz De­lights has been sell­ing her home­made snacks for two years mostly on­line. She also sold them at food fairs and bazaars such as the one near Sul­tan Mosque dur­ing Ra­madan.</p>
    <p>She spe­cialises in min jiang kueh ($6), a lo­cal pan­cake tra­di­tion­ally filled with peanuts and sugar. But she comes up with her own flavours, in­clud­ing the best-sell­ing Copa Ca­bana, which is a choco­late pan­cake filled with ba­nanas and choco­late rice. There are also those with durian or cheese.</p>
    <p>She de­cided to open her first phys­i­cal stall af­ter be­ing ap­proached by the land­lord be­cause she was do­ing well with on­line or­ders.</p>
    <p>Be­sides min jiang kueh, she also sells snacks such as on­deh-on­deh and kaya nutella ball.</p>
    <p>Other stalls that are open in­clude Hosay’s Del­i­cacy for mee pok; Liang Ji, which sells char kway teow and fried car­rot cake; and North In­dian stall RW Ex­press, with dishes such as chicken tikka and tan­doori meats.</p>
    <p>Two old brand names will join them next week.</p>
    <p>Rong Guang BBQ Seafood, which has been around for 35 years and is now at Trade­hub 21 in Boon Lay Way, will open on Aug 3.</p>
    <p>Al­ham­bra Satay will open the day af­ter. It started at the Satay Club along the Es­planade about 60 years ago and has two other out­lets in Gey­lang Serai.</p>
