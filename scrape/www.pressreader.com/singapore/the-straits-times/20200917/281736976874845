    <p>Peo­ple’s Park Com­plex and Peo­ple’s Park Cen­tre were vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were in­fec­tious, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The malls were added to a list of places vis­ited by com­mu­nity cases dur­ing their in­fec­tious pe­riod. The vis­its were made on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>MOH pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes and the times they vis­ited them to get peo­ple who were at those places at the same time to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on MOH’s web­site.</p>
    <p>The min­istry has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and that there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Two new cases in the com­mu­nity were re­ported yes­ter­day. Both pa­tients are work per­mit hold­ers, and were de­tected from ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers in the con­struc­tion, ma­rine and process sec­tors who stay out­side dor­mi­to­ries. They tested pos­i­tive on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Two new im­ported cases were also an­nounced yes­ter­day. Both ar­rived from In­dia. One is a 50-yearold Sin­ga­porean woman who returned last Satur­day and tested pos­i­tive yes­ter­day. The other is a twoyear-old boy, an In­dian na­tional and a long-term visit pass holder, who tested pos­i­tive on Tues­day. He ar­rived here on Sept 3.</p>
    <p>Both pa­tients were placed on 14-day stay-home no­tices upon ar­rival and were tested while serv­ing their no­tices at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 23 of the 27 new pa­tients an­nounced yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,514.</p>
    <p>MOH said it re­moved one case from the case count after fur­ther in­ves­ti­ga­tions. The pa­tient, iden­ti­fied as Case 57,107, tested neg­a­tive twice fol­low­ing an ini­tial pos­i­tive test re­sult.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions by lab­o­ra­tory ex­perts and an ex­pert panel as­sessed that his first test re­sult was a false­pos­i­tive one, said MOH. It added that all nec­es­sary pub­lic health ac­tions were taken ear­lier and nei­ther the pa­tient nor his con­tacts were ex­posed to the risk of in­fec­tion due to the ini­tial clas­si­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from two cases two weeks ago to one in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has also de­creased from a daily av­er­age of one case to less than one over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 71 pa­tients dis­charged yes­ter­day, 56,940 have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 42 pa­tients re­mained in hospi­tal yes­ter­day, with none in in­ten­sive care, and 490 were re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
