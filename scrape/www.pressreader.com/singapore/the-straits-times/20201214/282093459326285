    <p>An in­vi­ta­tion by the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) to its re­cent grad­u­ates to come up with fresh ideas for a post-Covid-19 world has seen 32 pro­pos­als short­listed since June.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­ca­tions are still stream­ing in for the NUS Re­silience and Growth In­no­va­tion Chal­lenge, for which the univer­sity has set aside $6 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The projects fall i nto three broad cat­e­gories of mak­ing peo­ple, so­ci­ety or the world bet­ter.</p>
    <p>The univer­sity in­tends to sup­port 115 projects in all, a nod to its 115th an­niver­sary this year.</p>
    <p>Each project is funded up to $50,000 for six months, and this grant can be used to pay a stipend of up to $1,200 per month per project mem­ber for the du­ra­tion of the project.</p>
    <p>So far, the ideas that have been ap­proved span from home-based farm­ing and por­ta­ble sci­ence kits for un­der­priv­i­leged chil­dren to vir­tual mu­se­ums for se­niors and ecofriendl­y car­ri­ers for on­line shop­ping.</p>
    <p>NUS pres­i­dent Tan Eng Chye said: “It is heart­en­ing to see youth cham­pi­oning causes that could pos­i­tively im­pact the world. As fu­ture lead­ers, the onus is on them to leave their mark for the next gen­er­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>One of the ap­proved projects was pitched by NUS ar­chi­tec­ture grad­u­ate Toby Fong, 26, who is de­sign­ing a more cost-ef­fi­cient and less bulky home hy­dro­pon­ics sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Mr Fong, whose fi­nal-year the­sis was on the topic of food se­cu­rity, said the panic buy­ing among house­holds ear­lier this year sparked his in­ter­est. Be­sides be­ing food con­sumers, “house­holds can also play an ac­tive role in en­sur­ing food se­cu­rity”, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Fong’s ar­chi­tec­tural knowl­edge came in handy for the project, known as su­per­FARM, as he con­sid­ered the space con­straints in many Sin­ga­pore fam­i­lies’ homes.</p>
    <p>His idea is to start with small crops that can be grown in a stand­alone tray that is about the size of a lap­top and can fit up to 11 plants.</p>
    <p>He is cur­rently work­ing on a pro­to­type, es­ti­mat­ing that each tray unit could cost about $100, half the price of sim­i­lar prod­ucts out there.</p>
    <p>His hope is to start peo­ple on one tray and slowly work them to­wards a fuller sys­tem that could be the size of a bed­side ta­ble or book­shelf.</p>
    <p>His sys­tem also comes with an app that can con­trol crop growth with dif­fer­ent fac­tors like hu­mid­ity, tem­per­a­ture and air flow.</p>
    <p>For a start, he has iden­ti­fied nearly 30 crops across three groups – herbs, leafy greens and fruits – more suited to Sin­ga­pore’s cli­mate.</p>
    <p>These in­clude basil, oregano, spring onion, chye sim, kangkung and cherry toma­toes.</p>
    <p>One tray can har­vest 400g of herbs, or 300g to 800g of leafy greens in three to four weeks.</p>
    <p>Mr Fong, who started work in Au­gust at a lo­cal ar­chi­tec­ture firm but has taken no-pay leave since Oc­to­ber for six months, said he has seen more in­ter­est in gar­den­ing in gen­eral among house­holds since the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“I think this trend will be here to stay,” he said.</p>
    <p>A group of five NUS grad­u­ates has come up with an on­line men­tor­ing net­work. Ms Vi­vian Ngiam, 23, one of the five, said there is cur­rently no cen­tralised plat­form to match young peo­ple seek­ing men­tors with or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>“A lot of peo­ple would think that LinkedIn is a very good op­tion for pro­fes­sional net­work­ing and men­tor­ship,” she said. But from a re­search sur­vey her team con­ducted, nearly half the stu­dents and fresh grad­u­ates felt that LinkedIn was not as use­ful in con­nect­ing them with men­tors.</p>
    <p>With their idea, With.Net­work, men­tor­ing stints can be set up on a pri­vate on­line plat­form unique to each or­gan­i­sa­tion. Stu­dents can then ap­ply for these stints and be matched to men­tors.</p>
    <p>The team’s pi­lot run starts next Fe­bru­ary; they will match 50 stu­dents with alumni of NUS En­ter­prise, the univer­sity’s en­trepreneur­ship arm.</p>
    <p>They are also work­ing to link stu­dents with stints in or­gan­i­sa­tions in the non-profit sec­tor, where many of the men­tor­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties may not be vis­i­ble on­line, they said.</p>
    <p>They also hope to match un­der­priv­i­leged stu­dents with men­tor­ship op­por­tu­ni­ties in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Ms Ngiam, a com­mu­ni­ca­tions and new me­dia grad­u­ate whose plan to work over­seas was up­ended by the pan­demic, said: “I wanted to make use of my time to do some­thing mean­ing­ful with a so­cial cause.”</p>
