    <p>De­feat for for­mer Malaysian premier Ma­hathir Mo­hamad’s new party at last Satur­day’s Slim by-elec­tion was ex­pected, but of great con­cern to the op­po­si­tion will be the eva­po­ra­tion of pre­vi­ously fer­vent non-Malay sup­port.</p>
    <p>This was Umno’s third straight by-elec­tion win since the Ma­hathir-led Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) govern­ment was top­pled in</p>
    <p>February, but sig­nif­i­cantly the first where it gained the sup­port of vot­ers who are not Bu­mi­put­eras – a term used to jointly re­fer to the Malay Mus­lim ma­jor­ity and in­dige­nous tribes.</p>
    <p>Over 90 per cent of eth­nic Chi­nese and 75 per cent of In­di­ans were said to have backed PH in 2018, bump­ing the nascent al­liance to a shock win – de­spite gar­ner­ing less than a third of Malay votes – that ended Umno’s six-decade rule.</p>
    <p>But last weekend’s vote in the Perak assem­bly ward – in­con­se­quen­tial to the Perikatan Na­sional (PN) state govern­ment which now has an 11-seat ma­jor­ity – saw Umno sweep all 13 polling dis­tricts, turn­ing around six non-Malay ma­jor­ity dis­tricts it lost two years ago.</p>
    <p>Then, Umno took 45 per cent of bal­lots cast, while a third of the Slim state con­stituency went with PH.</p>
    <p>But this time, Umno swal­lowed an 85 per cent share, with Tun Dr Ma­hathir’s newly-formed</p>
    <p>Parti Pe­juang Tanah Air tak­ing 14 per cent.</p>
    <p>While Malays make up three-quar­ters of the Slim elec­torate, both In­dian and Chi­nese-ma­jor­ity dis­tricts backed Umno de­spite it be­ing the largest mem­ber of the rul­ing PN pact that is dom­i­nated by Malay par­ties in­clud­ing Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS) and Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Umno’s Mohd Zaidi Aziz bagged over two-thirds of Ladang Sungkai, a district where 84 per cent of vot­ers are In­dian. In 2018, when Ber­satu was still led by Dr Ma­hathir and a mem­ber of PH, it gar­nered over 70 per cent sup­port there.</p>
    <p>Over in Sun­gai Slim Utara where six out of 10 vot­ers are Chi­nese,</p>
    <p>Umno took 61 per cent of the bal­lots cast, against just 18 per cent at the last gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts and PH lead­ers be­lieve the Pe­juang re­sult was ham­pered by the pre­vail­ing sen­ti­ment that chair­man Ma­hathir had ne­glected non-Bu­mi­put­eras while in power, as well as his re­fusal to ac­cept Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat (PKR) chief</p>
    <p>An­war Ibrahim as the op­po­si­tion’s prime min­is­te­rial can­di­date.</p>
    <p>“Pe­juang can­not take the 2018 non-Malay sup­port for granted as Ma­hathir was then seen as cru­cial to a regime change. But non-Malays soon found there was a hefty price to pay. Many didn’t turn out to vote in Slim or prag­mat­i­cally backed PN in hopes of in­fra­struc­ture spend­ing such as in flood mit­i­ga­tion,” said Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of In­ter­na­tional Af­fairs’ se­nior fel­low Oh Ei Sun.</p>
    <p>The Malay-only Pe­juang party re­mains out­side of the mul­tira­cial PH, a de­ci­sion os­ten­si­bly made to ap­peal to Malay vot­ers whose dis­trust of PH has grown since 2018.</p>
    <p>But Dr Ma­hathir’s con­tin­ued re­fusal to back Datuk Seri An­war as PM split the op­po­si­tion and made PH’s grassroots sup­port­ers wary of the for­mer premier.</p>
    <p>“The Pe­juang can­di­date suf­fered from the per­cep­tion that Ma­hathir is not will­ing to com­pro­mise with PH. For us to win the next gen­eral elec­tion, Pe­juang will need PH sup­port and vice versa,” said PKR vice-pres­i­dent Chang Lih Kang, who was among sev­eral PH lead­ers who went on the stump for Pe­juang’s Amir Khusyairi Tanusi, but to lit­tle avail.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the los­ing can­di­date him­self was bullish, as Pe­juang is only weeks-old. “I be­lieve I am a grow­ing baby tree. This is just the start,” said the 38-year-old lawyer.</p>
