    <p>Jose Mour­inho has la­belled Tot­ten­ham’s League Cup semi-fi­nal against Brent­ford to­day as the most im­por­tant match of his reign since tak­ing charge in Novem­ber 2019.</p>
    <p>Spurs host the sec­ond-tier Bees look­ing to reach the League Cup fi­nal against Manch­ester United or Manch­ester City, who play each other to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Other than Matt Do­herty’s sus­pen­sion and the in­jured Gareth Bale and Gio­vani Lo Celso, Mour­inho has no other wor­ries.</p>
    <p>They are with­out a ma­jor tro­phy since win­ning the 2008 League Cup and the Por­tuguese, who has won the tour­na­ment four times, is des­per­ate to end that drought.</p>
    <p>“Yes, I think so. In the per­spec­tive of the club chas­ing sil­ver­ware for many years, I would say so,” he said. “We al­ways have im­por­tant matches, last sea­son we had a match at (Crys­tal) Palace that would give us par­tic­i­pa­tion in this sea­son’s Europa League or not.</p>
    <p>“The match against Leeds was very im­por­tant as we went a few games with­out a vic­tory in the Premier League but I would say a semi-fi­nal is al­ways a very im­por­tant match. The only one more im­por­tant is a fi­nal.</p>
    <p>“I won the Car­ling Cup in my first sea­son af­ter a few months in Eng­land in 2004-05, so for me ev­ery com­pe­ti­tion is dif­fer­ent and it doesn’t mat­ter the club where you are or the am­bi­tions you have.</p>
    <p>“That is my way of look­ing at things, es­pe­cially at a club with­out sil­ver­ware for more than one decade. Af­ter more than one decade, ev­ery com­pe­ti­tion be­comes more im­por­tant and if we win two matches we win a tro­phy... which I think would be a very good thing for the club and for the play­ers.”</p>
    <p>Brent­ford will be no pushovers. Al­though the vis­i­tors have never won a ma­jor tro­phy in their 131-year his­tory, they could very well fea­ture in the Premier League next term as they are fourth in the sec­ond-tier ta­ble and firmly in the pro­mo­tion mix.</p>
    <p>Bees man­ager Thomas Frank is also not over­awed at hav­ing to take on Mour­inho, say­ing yes­ter­day: “I ad­mire him a lot for hav­ing that fan­tas­tic ca­reer.</p>
    <p>“But when the whis­tle blows, it’s just an­other bloke stand­ing in the dugout. I’m still pretty sure he also goes to the toi­let some­times.”</p>
    <p>The fi­nal has been moved to April 25 in the hope that fans will be al­lowed into Wem­b­ley by then.</p>
