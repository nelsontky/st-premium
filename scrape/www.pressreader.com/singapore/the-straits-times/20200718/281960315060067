    <p>• The first im­ages from a new so­lar mis­sion – the clos­est ever taken of the Sun – re­veal a ubiq­ui­tous bur­bling of minia­ture so­lar flares.</p>
    <p>The dis­cov­ery may pro­vide clues for how tur­bu­lence heats the at­mos­phere of the Sun and drives the ebb and flow of so­lar wind, the high-ve­loc­ity charged par­ti­cles through­out the so­lar sys­tem that buf­fet Earth and the other plan­ets.</p>
    <p>“We’ve never been closer to the Sun with a cam­era,” Dr Daniel Muller, the project sci­en­tist for the mis­sion, So­lar Or­biter, said at a news con­fer­ence held on Thurs­day by the Euro­pean Space Agency. “And this is just the be­gin­ning of the long epic jour­ney of So­lar Or­biter.”</p>
    <p>The minia­ture so­lar flares, which the sci­en­tists call camp­fires, were seen as the space­craft made its first close ap­proach to the Sun. It came within 77 mil­lion km of the Sun’s sur­face, which is just a bit more than half the dis­tance be­tween Earth and the Sun.</p>
    <p>The camp­fires are about one-mil­lionth or one-bil­lionth the size of flares that have been ob­served from Earth. The Sun is in the quiet part of its 11-year so­lar cy­cle, and the sur­face looks placid.</p>
    <p>“But then when you look at it at high res­o­lu­tion, it’s amaz­ing, in the small­est de­tails, how much stuff is go­ing on there,” said Dr David Bergh­mans of the Royal Ob­ser­va­tory of Bel­gium. He is prin­ci­pal in­ves­ti­ga­tor of an in­stru­ment that takes high­res­o­lu­tion im­ages of the lower lay­ers of the Sun’s at­mos­phere.</p>
    <p>“We couldn’t be­lieve this when we first saw this. And we started giv­ing it crazy names like camp­fires and dark fib­rils and ghosts and what­ever we saw.”</p>
    <p>So­lar Or­biter is a joint mis­sion be­tween the Euro­peans and the Na­tional Aero­nau­tics and Space Ad­min­is­tra­tion, which paid for the rocket that took the probe to space.</p>
    <p>One of the space­craft’s other in­stru­ments mea­sures the mag­netic field near the sur­face of the Sun.</p>
    <p>And it was al­ready able to ob­serve an ac­tive re­gion on a part of the sur­face that is not vis­i­ble from Earth.</p>
    <p>“That’s ex­cit­ing be­cause we know that the mag­netic field is a kind of holis­tic fea­ture of the Sun,” said Pro­fes­sor Sami Solanki of the Max Planck In­sti­tute for So­lar Sys­tem Re­search. He is the prin­ci­pal in­ves­ti­ga­tor of that in­stru­ment.</p>
    <p>“It spreads through the at­mos­phere and con­nects very dif­fer­ent parts of the Sun with each other.”</p>
    <p>With the new views, “we’re start­ing to see the whole beast”, he said.</p>
    <p>Launched in Fe­bru­ary, this mis­sion will pro­vide a new per­spec­tive of the Sun as it com­pletes 22 or­bits in 10 years.</p>
    <p>While most pre­vi­ous so­lar mis­sions or­bited in the eclip­tic, or the same plane that the plan­ets travel around the Sun, the or­bit of So­lar Or­biter will tilt up­wards so that it will have a bet­ter view of the star’s north and south poles.</p>
    <p>That change of view could help solve mys­ter­ies about the Sun’s mag­netic fields and how they ac­cel­er­ate those so­lar wind par­ti­cles.</p>
    <p>The data from So­lar Or­biter could help ex­plain the sunspot cy­cle – Why does the cy­cle last 11 years? Why are some quiet while oth­ers roar vi­o­lently? – and help mod­els to pre­dict so­lar storms that could dis­rupt Earth’s power grids and satel­lites in or­bit.</p>
