    <p>• Dustin Johnson has ex­pressed his dis­ap­point­ment at hav­ing to with­draw from this week’s CJ Cup in Las Ve­gas af­ter he tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The world No. 1 un­der­went a test af­ter ex­pe­ri­enc­ing symptoms of coro­n­avirus ahead of to­day’s open­ing round at Shadow Creek, the PGA Tour said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The 36-year-old, whose last outing came at last month’s US Open, is now in self-isolation, the tour added.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, I am very dis­ap­pointed,” the Amer­i­can said.</p>
    <p>“I was re­ally look­ing for­ward to com­pet­ing this week, but will do ev­ery­thing I can to re­turn as quickly as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“I have al­ready had a few calls with the Tour’s med­i­cal team and ap­pre­ci­ate all the sup­port and guid­ance they have given me.”</p>
    <p>Johnson’s with­drawal comes af­ter a stel­lar sea­son in which he won three times and took home his first FedEx­Cup cham­pi­onship at East Lake last month.</p>
    <p>He was also named PGA Tour Player of the Year for the sec­ond time.</p>
    <p>J.T. Pos­ton will re­place him in the CJ Cup field.</p>
    <p>Since the tour restarted in June af­ter a three-month shut­down</p>
    <p>caused by the pan­demic, PGA Tour events have been tak­ing place with­out spec­ta­tors while play­ers are not al­lowed to en­ter “the bub­ble” for each tour­na­ment with­out record­ing a neg­a­tive test first.</p>
    <p>Johnson is the most high-pro­file golfer to test pos­i­tive for the virus since the 2019-2020 sea­son re­sumed, while Bri­ton Sam Hors­field and Amer­i­can Scot­tie Sch­ef­fler were un­able to com­pete at the US Open due to their pos­i­tive Covid-19 tests.</p>
    <p>The news comes one week af­ter Amer­i­can Tony Finau was forced to with­draw from the Shriners Hos­pi­tals for Chil­dren Open af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for the virus which has killed more than 215,000 peo­ple in the United States.</p>
    <p>Finau will not com­pete at the CJ Cup ei­ther. This year’s event has been moved from South Korea’s Jeju Is­land to Las Ve­gas due to the pan­demic.</p>
