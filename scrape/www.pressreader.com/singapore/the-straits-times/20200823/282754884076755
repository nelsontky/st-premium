    <p>After six weeks as MP for Sengkang GRC, Ms He Ting Ru of the Work­ers’ Party (WP) has found that the job comes with new chal­lenges com­pared with her nine years of vol­un­teer work.</p>
    <p>“When you’re vol­un­teer­ing, you’re al­ways part of a team, but as an MP you end up be­ing the face of it,” says Ms He, who led the WP’s four-mem­ber Sengkang team to vic­tory in the gen­eral elec­tion last month.</p>
    <p>The 37-year-old mother of two says: “You need to step up a lit­tle bit more, take on more re­spon­si­bil­ity and give di­rec­tions. That’s been the main dif­fer­ence – be­ing a lot more front-fac­ing, and for me that’s not been the most nat­u­ral thing.”</p>
    <p>She adds that she has now be­come fa­mil­iar with the day-to-day du­ties of an MP, as well as par­lia­men­tary pro­cesses and pro­ce­dures, after be­ing in­volved in ground en­gage­ment, policy re­search and help­ing out at Meet-the-Peo­ple Ses­sions.</p>
    <p>The Cam­bridge Univer­sity-ed­u­cated lawyer joined the WP as a vol­un­teer in 2011 and was first fielded as a can­di­date in 2015.</p>
    <p>She was one of four new op­po­si­tion MPs who spoke to In­sight about their ex­pe­ri­ences since the July 10 Gen­eral Elec­tion and the is­sues they will raise when Par­lia­ment opens to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>FROM SMALL TO BIG IS­SUES</p>
    <p>Ms He’s new du­ties have cer­tainly kept her busy.</p>
    <p>On the fam­ily front, her hus­band Ter­ence Tan, a lawyer who con­tested East Coast GRC as a WP can­di­date, is also of­ten tied up with work, so Ms He’s par­ents have been help­ing to care for the cou­ple’s two young sons, aged two and three.</p>
    <p>As chair­man of the newly es­tab­lished Sengkang Town Coun­cil (SKTC), Ms He has been over­see­ing the han­dover of du­ties from two Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) town coun­cils han­dling the wards that now come un­der Sengkang GRC. Some of the staff who work for the man­ag­ing agents will be mov­ing over to join SKTC, she adds.</p>
    <p>The Sengkang GRC MPs have yet to be­gin their for­mal Meet-the-Peo­ple Ses­sions as lo­gis­ti­cal is­sues such as se­cur­ing power out­lets at void decks – where WP MPs usu­ally meet res­i­dents – are still be­ing sorted out, Ms He says.</p>
    <p>Her team plans to start ses­sions next month, but the MPs have al­ready been en­gag­ing with res­i­dents through phone calls, e-mail and text mes­sages. They also ar­range vis­its to res­i­dents’ homes.</p>
    <p>When asked what she will speak on in her maiden speech in Par­lia­ment, Ms He cites is­sues re­lat­ing to jobs – a com­mon theme among the op­po­si­tion MPs in­ter­viewed – as well as sus­tain­abil­ity and sup­port for fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>Alju­nied GRC MP Ger­ald Giam, who was a WP Non-Con­stituency MP (NCMP) from 2011 to 2015, started his in-per­son Meet-the-Peo­ple Ses­sion re­cently.</p>
    <p>There has been “no down­time” and “no short­age of ex­cite­ment” since the GE, he says, with res­i­dents rais­ing is­sues rang­ing from mu­nic­i­pal prob­lems to peren­nial na­tional con­cerns over Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) monies and im­mi­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Giam, 42, lists health­care fi­nanc­ing, re­tire­ment ad­e­quacy and jobs as some of the is­sues he is keen to raise.</p>
    <p>One thing he has no­ticed since be­com­ing an MP is that it takes time to build fa­mil­iar­ity and trust with res­i­dents. It took three meet­ings with one res­i­dent be­fore she be­gan to open up.</p>
    <p>He has also found him­self hav­ing to ex­plain gov­ern­ment poli­cies and sug­gest al­ter­na­tive so­lu­tions if he be­lieves a res­i­dent’s re­quested ap­peal is un­likely to be granted.</p>
    <p>A MORE PROAC­TIVE ELEC­TORATE</p>
    <p>Both Mr Giam and Ms He say they are heart­ened to hear not only from res­i­dents who bring up their own is­sues, but also from those who raise con­cerns on be­half of neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>Says Ms He: “I’ve had peo­ple ap­proach me to say they are aware of some­one who lives on his own, or a par­tic­u­lar fam­ily fac­ing cer­tain is­sues, and they ask if there is any­thing we can do to help. That’s pos­i­tive and in­spir­ing. It’s nice that even though we’ve all had a very chal­leng­ing year, peo­ple still look out for one another.”</p>
    <p>Mr Giam says many res­i­dents are ea­ger to con­trib­ute their own ideas for im­prov­ing the com­mu­nity, such as start­ing com­mu­nity gar­dens. “It shows that the res­i­dents want to take own­er­ship of their com­mu­nity,” he says.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore­ans have changed the way they see po­lit­i­cal en­gage­ment. When I first en­tered pol­i­tics 10 years ago, it was more like, ‘show us what you can do, let us watch you per­form’. Now it is more par­tic­i­pa­tive.”</p>
    <p>Ms He and Mr Giam, who both worked on the WP’s man­i­festo, have also no­ticed a rise in in­ter­est in policy is­sues.</p>
    <p>Ms He says more res­i­dents have been ap­proach­ing her to dis­cuss the man­i­festo and ask in-depth ques­tions, com­pared with pre­vi­ous elec­tions.</p>
    <p>Says Mr Giam: “Peo­ple are pay­ing more at­ten­tion to the is­sues and realise that poli­cies are much more com­pli­cated these days. No one party or in­di­vid­ual has the monopoly of wis­dom. They also realise that they have to un­der­stand the poli­cies, and many ap­pre­ci­ate that we are tak­ing a bal­anced view of things.”</p>
    <p>PSP PAR­LIA­MEN­TAR­I­ANS KEEP SIGHT OF WEST COAST GRC</p>
    <p>Two NCMPs from the Progress Sin­ga­pore Party (PSP) will be sworn in along with the WP MPs.</p>
    <p>Ms Hazel Poa, 49, and Mr Leong Mun Wai, 60, may not be of­fi­cially rep­re­sent­ing any con­stituency, but they tell In­sight they in­tend to con­tinue en­gag­ing with res­i­dents in West Coast GRC and bring­ing their con­cerns to the House.</p>
    <p>The party has also been dis­cussing ini­tia­tives and pro­grammes that it wants to start there based on res­i­dents’ feed­back, Mr Leong says. One is to match res­i­dents with vol­un­teers who can pro­vide ser­vices such as English tu­ition and com­puter re­pair.</p>
    <p>“We have con­tin­ued to go down to the ground after the elec­tion to think of ways we can serve the res­i­dents and col­lect in­for­ma­tion on the is­sues they are in­ter­ested in for us to bring up in Par­lia­ment,” says Mr Leong.</p>
    <p>He adds that most res­i­dents have been rais­ing bread-and-but­ter is­sues as well as mu­nic­i­pal and es­tate-re­lated mat­ters.</p>
    <p>One un­usual re­quest came from a res­i­dent who heard he was flu­ent in Ja­panese. The woman, who has a Ja­panese hus­band, asked for Mr Leong’s help on Ja­panese in­her­i­tance laws.</p>
    <p>The key is­sue which Mr Leong will dis­cuss in his maiden speech is jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans, he says, adding that he is look­ing for­ward to work­ing with both the WP and the PAP to im­prove Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In the longer term, he wants to push for the re­form of poli­cies that he says ben­e­fit for­eign pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians at the ex­pense of lo­cals.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, Ms Poa says many res­i­dents she vis­ited have asked for help in find­ing jobs and raised con­cerns over CPF and hous­ing.</p>
    <p>On her jour­ney to en­ter­ing Par­lia­ment, she says it has been long and “not smooth sail­ing”, but she counts her­self lucky as she has the sup­port of her fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Ms Poa en­tered pol­i­tics in 2011 and con­tested Chua Chu Kang GRC along with her hus­band, Mr Tony Tan Lay Thiam, as mem­bers of the Na­tional Sol­i­dar­ity Party.</p>
    <p>She adds that her fa­ther was once jailed briefly for his par­tic­i­pa­tion in a stu­dent demon­stra­tion while in se­condary school. Given that history, her par­ents have been sup­port­ive of her po­lit­i­cal ca­reer, she says with a laugh.</p>
    <p>Ms Poa says that while she feels some pres­sure to per­form well in Par­lia­ment, PSP chief Tan Cheng Bock has been “rather kind” and has told her to “take it easy”.</p>
    <p>“I’m really look­ing for­ward to this be­cause I have worked a long time for (it),” she says. “I will make the next five years worth all that has hap­pened be­fore.”</p>
