    <p>Do we need to warm up an elec­tric car? And is there a “break­ing in” phase when we should not drive it too hard?</p>
    <p>An in­ter­nal com­bus­tion en­gine con­sists of var­i­ous snug-fit­ting parts that need to move at rather high speeds. In ad­di­tion, these parts re­quire plenty of lu­bri­ca­tion, all pro­vided by the en­gine oil.</p>
    <p>Be­fore achiev­ing the nec­es­sary lev­els of flu­id­ity and lu­bric­ity, the oil needs to reach tem­per­a­tures of be­tween 80 and 100 deg C. This is crit­i­cal to avoid fric­tion dam­age be­tween sur­faces.</p>
    <p>The en­gine in an elec­tric ve­hi­cle (EV) leads a much sim­pler life. The elec­tric mo­tor shaft bear­ings are the only pre­ci­sion-fit items. These low-fric­tion bear­ings do not need a sump of warmed-up oil to con­tin­u­ously spray over them. Hence, the mo­tor does not need to go through a warm-up phase.</p>
    <p>None­the­less, its trans­mis­sion, sus­pen­sion, brakes and tyres will need to warm up to op­er­ate op­ti­mally.</p>
    <p>Gen­er­ally, these parts will warm up af­ter 2 to 3km. Be­sides, it is al­ways a good prac­tice to check that the brakes work fine and there are no un­usual noises com­ing from the driv­e­train, sus­pen­sion or tyres.</p>
    <p>The same rou­tine ap­plies to the run­ning-in phase of a new EV. The mo­tor does not need any part to be gen­tly honed in, un­like in a com­bus­tion en­gine.</p>
    <p>As for the bat­tery pack, there is gen­er­ally no warm-up pro­to­col. One of the ma­jor sub-sys­tems in every EV is the ther­mal man­age­ment sys­tem, which cools the bat­tery pack. This does not re­quire warm­ing up ei­ther.</p>
    <p>Run­ning in for the sake of get­ting the rest of the EV’s me­chan­i­cal parts work­ing healthily is al­ways rec­om­mended.</p>
    <p>But per­haps the most im­por­tant el­e­ment to run in at the start of any jour­ney is the driver. It is ad­vis­able not to drive ag­gres­sively as soon as you get be­hind the wheel.</p>
