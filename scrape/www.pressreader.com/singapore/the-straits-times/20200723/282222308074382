    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX) and Nas­daq will ex­tend their part­ner­ship to help com­pa­nies ac­cess cap­i­tal in both ju­ris­dic­tions.</p>
    <p>The in­creased co­op­er­a­tion will in­clude a stream­lined frame­work for is­suers seek­ing a sec­ondary list­ing on SGX, the Sin­ga­pore bourse said in a state­ment on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The two ex­changes are deep­en­ing their part­ner­ship at a time when ten­sions be­tween the United States and China have es­ca­lated, China has ce­mented its con­trol over Hong Kong, and com­pe­ti­tion be­tween Asia’s two fi­nan­cial hubs has in­creased.</p>
    <p>The f rame­work al­lows doc­u­ments re­quired for the SGX list­ing to be based on in­for­ma­tion con­tained in the US list­ing and sub­se­quent fil­ing doc­u­ments to the US Se­cu­ri­ties and Ex­change Com­mis­sion and/or Nas­daq, to­gether with ad­di­tional dis­clo­sure i n com­pli­ance with Sin­ga­pore’s rules.</p>
    <p>A dual-list­ing tie-up with Nas­daq “will sig­nif­i­cantly bring up SGX’s pro­file” as an im­por­tant des­ti­na­tion for technology list­ings in Asia, said Ms Margaret Yang, a strate­gist at Dai­lyFX in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“This is sig­nif­i­cant for SGX, which has suf­fered from delist­ings and lack of technology firm IPOs (ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ings) in the past years.”</p>
    <p>Co­op­er­a­tion will fur­ther en­able mon­i­tor­ing and as­sess­ment of is­suers, and the en­force­ment of reg­u­la­tory ac­tions, in­clud­ing re­fer­rals of cases to the au­thor­i­ties of the re­spec­tive ju­ris­dic­tions.</p>
    <p>Shares of SGX fell by as much as 19 cents, or 2.25 per cent, to $8.25 yesterday.</p>
    <p>SGX saw its stock price tum­ble in May after MSCI an­nounced it would move li­cens­ing for de­riv­a­tives prod­ucts on some gauges to Hong Kong from Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>It has not stayed still – the bourse said last month it would launch sin­gle-stock fu­tures on some com­pa­nies listed in Sin­ga­pore, and an­nounced it will ac­quire the re­main­ing 80 per cent stake in BidFX, a for­eign ex­change trad­ing plat­form.</p>
