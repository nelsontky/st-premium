    <p>CAT’S BALD SPOT ON BELLY</p>
    <p>My cat has a big bald spot on his belly (right), but there are no signs of flea or skin in­fec­tion. I Googled his con­di­tion and the rea­son given was that it was due to bore­dom, so my cat ap­par­ently ex­ces­sively groomed him­self. Is this true? What can be done to stop fur­ther hair loss? Shirley Liew</p>
    <p>Does your cat show signs of itch­i­ness at the bald area? How long has the bald area been there?</p>
    <p>There are many causes of hair loss and these would be some of the ques­tions your vet may ask to rule out cer­tain dis­eases.</p>
    <p>Note that other than fleas, there are also par­a­sites that can cause hair loss. It is im­por­tant to keep up-to-date with anti-par­a­sitic treat­ments. Your vet may also con­duct fur­ther tests to en­sure that the cause of hair loss is not due to al­ler­gies or meta­bolic dis­eases.</p>
    <p>Cats may over­groom them­selves, caus­ing hair loss. This is some­times a sign that your cat is stressed. It might be help­ful to iden­tify the cause and re­move it to re­duce such be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>How­ever, purely be­havioural or psy­chogenic rea­sons for over­groom­ing are also rare, so it is im­por­tant to first rule out other con­di­tions. Have you or your fam­ily mem­bers ob­served this over­groom­ing be­hav­iour? If so, take a video of it, which will help your vet’s di­ag­nos­tic process.</p>
    <p>You may also wish to in­crease the in­ter­ac­tion and so­cial­i­sa­tion with your cat, and pro­vide more en­rich­ment such as food toys dur­ing feed­ing time.</p>
    <p>Keep­ing your pet en­gaged and men­tally stim­u­lated is ben­e­fi­cial for his over­all well-be­ing.</p>
