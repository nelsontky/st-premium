    <p>FIC­TION</p>
    <p>THE DEATH OF VIVEK OJI</p>
    <p>By Ak­waeke Emezi</p>
    <p>Faber & Faber/Pa­per­back/ 248 pages/$27.82/Avail­able at bit.ly/DeathofVOj­i_AE</p>
    <p>★★★★</p>
    <p>On the day that the mar­ket burns down in a riot, Vivek Oji’s mother opens the door of their house to find her son ly­ing dead on the ve­randa, wrapped in wo­ven ak­wete cloth, the back of his skull bro­ken.</p>
    <p>Nige­rian author Ak­waeke Emezi, whose much-lauded de­but novel Fresh­wa­ter was longlisted for the Women’s Prize for Fic­tion, de­liv­ers a sor­row­ful, evanes­cent tale of young Nige­ri­ans grow­ing up in a com­mu­nity that lacks the lan­guage, let alone the space, to hold them.</p>
    <p>The tragedy of Vivek Oji be­gins when he is born the same day that his grand­mother Ahunna dies, a scar on her foot in­ex­pli­ca­bly ap­pear­ing as a birth­mark on his. “They brought him into a home filled with in­ca­pac­i­tat­ing sor­row; his whole life was a mourn­ing,” writes Emezi.</p>
    <p>Vivek is a strange and beau­ti­ful child. He has black­outs and speaks of things no­body else can hear, like the sound of rain. As he grows older, he be­gins to grow his hair longer.</p>
    <p>His par­ents try to love him with­out fully know­ing how. His fa­ther Chika sends him to a mil­i­tary academy to toughen him up. His mother Kavita, who left Delhi to es­cape the mark of her fa­ther’s caste, brushes and oils Vivek’s hair, yet feels shut out from his in­ner life.</p>
    <p>Af­ter his death, she is de­ter­mined to find an­swers, even though the friends clos­est to him – in­clud­ing his cousin Osita, grap­pling with a guilt of his own – fear the truth she seeks will de­stroy her.</p>
    <p>The Death Of Vivek Oji is not told in a lin­ear fash­ion, nor con­fined to a sin­gle per­spec­tive. Rather, it is a ca­coph­ony of voices – Vivek, Kavita, Osita and more – that form the frag­mented im­pres­sion of a per­son.</p>
    <p>Emezi dis­rupts bound­aries, let­ting past and present cir­cle flu­idly in the nar­ra­tive such that Vivek is at once dead and not dead, male and not male, scat­tered and whole.</p>
    <p>Vivek through­out is a flick­er­ing, un­de­fin­able pres­ence, even as his body is marked vis­cer­ally again and again. Cig­a­rette burns ap­pear on his skin af­ter he re­turns from board­ing school, welts on his flesh af­ter a par­tic­u­larly horrifying ex­pe­ri­ence with ex­or­cism at his aunt’s church.</p>
    <p>Es­pe­cially pow­er­ful are the words Emezi finds for dys­pho­ria: “I felt heavy my whole life... Life was like be­ing dragged through con­crete in cir­cles, wet and set­ting con­crete that dried with each ro­ta­tion of my un­will­ing body.”</p>
    <p>The Death Of Vivek Oji is a heart­break­ing, yet up­lift­ing at­tempt to voice dif­fer­ence. It re­jects the sin­gu­lar nar­ra­tive and seeks mul­ti­ple ways to be.</p>
    <p>If you like this, read: Fresh­wa­ter by the same author (Faber & Faber, 2018, $18.27, avail­able at bit.ly/Fresh­wa­ter_AE), about Ada, a young Nige­rian woman haunted by the og­banje, spir­its from Igbo cos­mol­ogy that give her mul­ti­ple per­son­al­i­ties and self-de­struc­tive ten­den­cies.</p>
