    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong re­ported the low­est num­ber of new Covid-19 cases yes­ter­day since its lat­est – and worst ever – out­break started last month, bol­ster­ing hopes that strin­gent city-wide con­tain­ment mea­sures can be eased.</p>
    <p>The city has also seen a de­cline in the share of cases with un­known ori­gins over the past week, sig­nalling that un­trace­able in­fec­tions are dwin­dling. It re­ported 23 new lo­cal virus cases yes­ter­day, of which only eight had un­trace­able ori­gins.</p>
    <p>For the past six days, cases of un­known ori­gins have not crossed the 35 per cent mark, down from the peak of about 60 per cent in mid-July when the virus were qui­etly spread­ing in the com­mu­nity. More than two-thirds of Hong Kong’s over 4,500 re­ported cases have emerged since last month.</p>
    <p>De­clin­ing new lo­cal cases i n Hong Kong as well as a fall­ing pro­por­tion of un­trace­able cases un­der­score the suc­cess of re­cent so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures i n slow­ing trans­mis­sion. New over­all in­fec­tions have dropped to fewer than 100 lo­cal cases for over two weeks.</p>
    <p>Un­known in­fec­tions, where pa­tients can­not be linked to other con­firmed cases, in­di­cate hid­den chains of trans­mis­sion and have been a cause of worry. A high pro­por­tion of such cases forces public health au­thor­i­ties to take blunt and broad ac­tion such as shut­ting down en­tire cities as they race to stamp out the stealthy novel pathogen.</p>
    <p>De­spite the re­cent signs of re­lief, the Hong Kong govern­ment is pro­ject­ing cau­tion.</p>
    <p>“There is no room for com­pla­cency in epi­demic con­trol,” a spokesman for the Food and Health Bureau said in a state­ment on Mon­day, warn­ing that the third wave of in­fec­tions is de­clin­ing much slower than the se­cond, de­spite more strin­gent bor­der and so­cial dis­tanc­ing con­trols.</p>
