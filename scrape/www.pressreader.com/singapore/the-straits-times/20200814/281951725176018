    <p>The lat­est series of askST@NLB talks kicks off on Aug 28, in a new video for­mat but sim­i­larly tack­ling hot top­ics of the day.</p>
    <p>Straits Times in­vest edi­tor Tan Ooi Boon and SingCap­i­tal chief ex­ec­u­tive Al­fred Chia will head­line the first talk, which is on how to man­age one’s money amid the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The talks, which started in 2016, are a col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween The Straits Times and the Na­tional Li­brary Board (NLB).</p>
    <p>Helmed by Straits Times jour­nal­ists, they take on ev­ery­day top­ics such as cur­rent af­fairs, fi­nance, ed­u­ca­tion, health and life­style.</p>
    <p>They were pre­vi­ously held at the</p>
    <p>Cen­tral Pub­lic Li­brary in Vic­to­ria Street, be­fore be­ing pro­duced as pod­casts from May to June be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>This new series will be recorded at the Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’ guest lounge and broad­cast monthly on The Straits Times’ Face­book page.</p>
    <p>Read­ers can sub­mit ques­tions for Mr Tan and Mr Chia to ad­dress in their talk via str.sg/askstAUG by 7pm next Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said: “Just like for our health and well-be­ing, we need to take ac­tive steps to plan ahead so that our fi­nan­cial health is in good con­di­tion to last us through our life­time.</p>
    <p>“Al­fred and I hope that we can share prac­ti­cal tips on how fam­i­lies can gen­er­ate some in­come, re­duce debts as well as plan for the fu­ture so that we won’t need to worry when the next rainy day hits us.”</p>
    <p>Mr Chia said: “We are liv­ing in un­prece­dented times and may feel lost in fi­nan­cial man­age­ment. How­ever, there are oth­ers who see this as tremen­dous in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties. I’m ex­cited to work with Ooi Boon to share dif­fer­ent fi­nan­cial strate­gies which will be use­ful to nav­i­gate un­cer­tain times.”</p>
    <p>There will be 12 ses­sions re­leased be­tween this month and June next year. Each record­ing will be about 45 min­utes to an hour long. The speak­ers will spend the first half dis­cussing top­i­cal is­sues, be­fore an­swer­ing some ques­tions sent in ear­lier from the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond talk, which will be avail­able from Sept 25, fea­tures Straits Times se­nior health cor­re­spon­dent Joyce Teo and Ms Angie Chew, who was named Sin­ga­porean of The Year last year for her ad­vo­cacy for men­tal well­ness.</p>
    <p>Ms Chew is also the CEO of Brahm Cen­tre, a char­ity that of­fers health ed­u­ca­tion and men­tal sup­port.</p>
    <p>They will dis­cuss how peo­ple can stay sane dur­ing the eco­nomic down­turn and emerge from the pan­demic more re­silient.</p>
    <p>De­tails on how to send in ques­tions to Ms Teo and Ms Chew will be re­leased at a later date.</p>
    <p>NLB direc­tor of com­mu­ni­ca­tions, re­la­tions and de­vel­op­ment Sabi­tri Devi said: “We are de­lighted to con­tinue the fifth edi­tion of the askST@NLB talks with The Straits Times. The top­ics of the talks have been rel­e­vant in cre­at­ing strong au­di­ence en­gage­ment.</p>
    <p>“We hope the up­com­ing talks per­tain­ing to Covid-19 are use­ful as our so­ci­ety con­tin­ues to learn how to cope with the im­pact of the pan­demic. For those who want to read and learn more about these top­ics, we will be also show­cas­ing re­lated re­sources from our col­lec­tions on the askST@NLB mi­crosite.”</p>
