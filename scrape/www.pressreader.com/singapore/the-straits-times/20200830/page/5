        Top of theNews | | A5 The Sunday Times Sunday, August 30, 2020 3 Myth: Ceca has caused overconcen­tration of Indian nationals in some companies here the General Agreement on Trade in Services. Local companies tap Singaporea­n ICTs too, when they expand overseas, he said.
“It applies equally to Indian companies coming here and to Singapore companies going overseas – under Ceca or under any other (free trade agreements). This is to help them kick-start the overseas operations.” Since Ceca was signed in 2005, Singapore’s trade with India has grown by $7.6 billion and investment­s, by 34 times.
By 2018, more than 650 companies in Singapore had invested in India.
Mr Chan said the trade pact not only protects Singapore companies that invest in India, but also attracts foreign investors who invest in India, and employ Singaporea­ns to manage their investment­s.
In Singapore, these companies employ nearly 100,000 Singap o r e a n s a n d p e r ma n e n t r e s i - It is not that Singaporea­ns are not good enough for the jobs in these sectors, but that Singapore does not have enough people for these jobs, he said.
“We do not have enough numbers to get to the critical mass.”
Mr Chan said the profile of Singapore’s foreign workforce will evolve over time as its industry profile changes.
“In the 1960s and 1970s, when we were building up our petrochemi­cal industries, the top management positions (in companies such as Shell) were not mainly Singaporea­ns either. But after a few dents.
What this means is that the Indian market, as with other large markets, helps these companies to diversify and make their operations more robust.
“Besides having better access to a huge market and all the savings that come with tariff reductions, it also allows us to grow our capabiliti­es,” said Mr Chan.
Companies such as PSA and engineerin­g firm Meinhardt are also now key players in port management and engineerin­g in India, he added. decades, why is it that the top spots are held by Singaporea­ns?
“Because we allowed the previous generation the opportunit­y to create jobs not only for themselves, but also for this generation.”
The same thing happened in the 1980s and 1990s, when Singapore’s focus was on electronic­s and semiconduc­tors, he said.
“Today, we have a whole generation of precision engineerin­g firms, engineers to support the semiconduc­tor industry, and have many spin-offs.” Mr Chan said the presence of certain nationalit­ies is shaped by the choice of sectors Singapore wants to grow.
Currently, these include new and fast-growing sectors, such as info-communicat­ions and technology, profession­al services and financial services. 2 Myth: Ceca does not benefit Singapore economical­ly Grace Ho PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTE­D BY PRESSREADE­R PressReade­r.com +1 604 278 4604 ORIGINAL COPY .
