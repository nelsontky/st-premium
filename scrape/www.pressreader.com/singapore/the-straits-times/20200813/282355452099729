    <p>MEL­BOURNE • The 2021 Aus­tralian Open could be moved to later in the year due to Covid-19 but tour­na­ment di­rec­tor Craig Ti­ley told Reuters that the or­gan­is­ers are con­fi­dent of host­ing the Grand Slam in its usual Jan­uary slot with full prize money and fans in the stands.</p>
    <p>Mel­bourne is in the midst of a full lock­down af­ter a sec­ond spike in coro­n­avirus cases but Ti­ley and his team have been work­ing since shortly af­ter this year’s edi­tion fin­ished to draw up strate­gies to en­sure next year’s tour­na­ment goes ahead.</p>
    <p>Ticket sales will start in Oc­to­ber and five “bio-se­cure bub­bles” will be opened across the coun­try six weeks be­fore the tour­na­ment be­gins to al­low play­ers ar­riv­ing in Aus­tralia to avoid the most re­stric­tive quar­an­tine mea­sures, he said.</p>
    <p>“We’re go­ing to open our bio bub­ble from the first of De­cem­ber and play­ers can come at any time,” Ten­nis Aus­tralia’s (TA) chief ex­ec­u­tive added in a video call.</p>
    <p>“When the play­ers ar­rive, they’re not go­ing to be in a ho­tel for 14 days like the cur­rent re­quire­ments are. We’ll have an ex­emp­tion within this bio-se­cure bub­ble.</p>
    <p>“We’ve said ev­ery year that we’re the ‘Happy Slam’. But now we’re say­ing we’re the ‘ Very safe and happy Slam’.”</p>
    <p>He said or­gan­is­ers had em­ployed a global ex­pert to help set up the bio-se­cu­rity bub­bles and test­ing fa­cil­i­ties in Perth, Bris­bane, Syd­ney, Ade­laide and Mel­bourne, which will al­low play­ers to ac­cli­ma­tise and train for the Grand Slam.</p>
    <p>TA’s cri­sis man­age­ment team, set up be­cause of the bush fire smoke that threat­ened this year’s tour­na­ment, has put a busi­ness and op­er­a­tional plan in place for each of the sce­nar­ios they came up with.</p>
    <p>The first sce­nario was the event be­ing held in much the same way as 2020, while the sec­ond was a tour­na­ment with lim­ited crowds.</p>
    <p>“Sce­nario three was be­hind closed doors, a broad­cast-only event. Sce­nario four was mov­ing to an­other time of the year,” Ti­ley added.</p>
    <p>“And sce­nario five is no event at all.”</p>
    <p>He was con­fi­dent of be­ing able to wel­come some 400,000 fans to Mel­bourne Park next year, about half the num­ber that at­tended this year’s tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>The vast site, which cov­ers an area of about 2.5km, al­lows or­gan­is­ers to en­force phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing ef­fec­tively, while the wear­ing of masks will be manda­tory.</p>
    <p>Ti­ley also said they would con­sult with the main tours if they were forced to resched­ule, not act uni­lat­er­ally as the or­gan­is­ers of the French Open did when they moved their event from May to the end of Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian win­ter would rule out the months of May to July as prospec­tive win­dows but March-April or Septem­ber-Oc­to­ber could be looked at, he added.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian Open, which has been held in Mel­bourne since 1972, is the pri­mary source of rev­enue for TA and the last edi­tion had a direct eco­nomic im­pact of A$387 mil­lion (S$380 mil­lion) on Mel­bourne, Ti­ley said.</p>
    <p>TA ex­pects turnover and rev­enue from the next edi­tion to de­crease by a dou­ble-digit per­cent­age but they will not be re­duc­ing the A$71 mil­lion prize purse.</p>
    <p>“I’m op­ti­mistic and pos­i­tive that we’ll have an event and it’ll be in Mel­bourne,” said Ti­ley, adding that TA had cash re­serves of A$80 mil­lion to rely upon in the event the tour­na­ment had to be can­celled.</p>
    <p>“It will have some crowds and it’ll be the be­gin­ning of kind of get­ting back to the way we were.”</p>
    <p>DON’T WORRY, BE HAPPY</p>
    <p>We’ve said ev­ery year that we’re the ‘Happy Slam’. But now we’re say­ing we’re the ‘Very safe and happy Slam’. ’’</p>
    <p>CRAIG TI­LEY , Aus­tralian Open tour­na­ment di­rec­tor, on hav­ing bio-se­cure bub­bles in the coun­try to keep play­ers safe.</p>
