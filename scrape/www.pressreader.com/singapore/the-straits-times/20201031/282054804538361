    <p>For­eign pol­icy Trade</p>
    <p>“From this mo­ment on, it’s go­ing to be Amer­ica First. Ev­ery de­ci­sion on trade, on taxes, on im­mi­gra­tion, on for­eign af­fairs, will be made to ben­e­fit Amer­i­can work­ers and Amer­i­can fam­i­lies.”</p>
    <p>– Mr Trump’s in­au­gu­ral ad­dress on Jan 20, 2017</p>
    <p>“The United States will for­ever be a great friend to the world, and es­pe­cially to its al­lies. But we can no longer be taken ad­van­tage of, or en­ter into a one-sided deal where the United States gets noth­ing in re­turn.”</p>
    <p>– Mr Trump at the United Na­tions Gen­eral Assem­bly on Sept 19, 2017</p>
    <p>“We must pro­tect our bor­ders from the rav­ages of other coun­tries mak­ing our prod­ucts, steal­ing our com­pa­nies, and de­stroy­ing our jobs. Pro­tec­tion will lead to great pros­per­ity and strength.”</p>
    <p>– Mr Trump’s in­au­gu­ral ad­dress on Jan 20, 2017</p>
    <p>“China’s pat­tern of mis­con­duct is well known. For decades, they have ripped off the United States like no one has ever done be­fore...</p>
    <p>But I never solely blamed China for this. They were able to get away with a theft like no one was able to get away with be­fore be­cause of past politi­cians and, frankly, past pres­i­dents.”</p>
    <p>– Mr Trump an­nounc­ing ac­tions against China at the Rose Gar­den on May 29, 2020</p>
    <p>“The United States re­mains com­mit­ted to</p>
    <p>Asean’s cen­tral role as a re­gional fo­rum for to­tal co­op­er­a­tion… We want our part­ners in the re­gion to be strong, in­de­pen­dent and pros­per­ous, in con­trol of their own des­tinies and satel­lites to no one. Th­ese are the prin­ci­ples be­hind our vi­sion for a free and open Indo-Pa­cific.”</p>
    <p>– Mr Trump at the fifth US-Asean Sum­mit in Manila on Nov 13, 2017</p>
    <p>“The United States has great strength and pa­tience, but if it is forced to de­fend it­self or its al­lies, we will have no choice but to to­tally de­stroy North Korea. Rocket Man is on a sui­cide mis­sion for him­self and for his regime.”</p>
    <p>– Mr Trump at the United Na­tions Gen­eral Assem­bly on Sept 19, 2017</p>
    <p>“The Bi­den for­eign pol­icy agenda will place the United States back at the head of the ta­ble, in a po­si­tion to work with its al­lies and part­ners to mo­bilise col­lec­tive ac­tion on global threats.”</p>
    <p>– Mr Bi­den’s For­eign Af­fairs com­men­tary, “Why Amer­ica Must Lead Again”, in Jan 2020</p>
    <p>“Let’s be clear: work­ing co­op­er­a­tively with other na­tions that share our val­ues and goals doesn’t make Amer­ica a sucker – it makes us more se­cure and more suc­cess­ful.”</p>
    <p>– Mr Bi­den’s for­eign pol­icy speech at the City Univer­sity of New York on July 11, 2019</p>
    <p>“The wrong thing to do is to put our heads in the sand and say no more trade deals. Coun­tries will trade with or with­out the US.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion is: Who writes the rules that gov­ern trade? Who will make sure they pro­tect work­ers, the en­vi­ron­ment, trans­parency, and mid­dle-class wages? The US, not China, should be lead­ing that ef­fort.”</p>
    <p>– Mr Bi­den’s For­eign Af­fairs com­men­tary, “Why Amer­ica Must Lead Again”, in Jan 2020</p>
    <p>“The US does need to get tough with China...</p>
    <p>The most ef­fec­tive way to meet that chal­lenge is to build a united front of US al­lies and part­ners to con­front China’s abu­sive be­hav­iours and hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions, even as we seek to co­op­er­ate with Bei­jing on is­sues where our in­ter­ests con­verge, such as cli­mate change, non-pro­lif­er­a­tion, and global health se­cu­rity.”</p>
    <p>– Mr Bi­den’s For­eign Af­fairs com­men­tary,</p>
    <p>“Why Amer­ica Must Lead Again”, in Jan 2020</p>
    <p>“We will also strengthen our al­liances with Ja­pan, South Korea, Aus­tralia and other Asian democ­ra­cies, while sus­tain­ing an iron­clad com­mit­ment to Is­rael’s se­cu­rity.”</p>
    <p>– Mr Bi­den on Amer­i­can lead­er­ship on his cam­paign web­site</p>
    <p>“With North Korea, I will em­power our ne­go­tia­tors and jump-start a sus­tained, co­or­di­nated cam­paign with our al­lies and oth­ers, in­clud­ing China, to ad­vance our shared ob­jec­tive of a de­nu­cle­arised North Korea.”</p>
    <p>– Mr Bi­den’s For­eign Af­fairs com­men­tary, “Why Amer­ica Must Lead Again”, in Jan 2020</p>
