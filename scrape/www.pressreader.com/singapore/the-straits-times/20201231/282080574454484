    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Se­na­tor Mitch McCon­nell has blocked an at­tempt by Democrats to hold an im­me­di­ate vote on in­creas­ing stim­u­lus cheques to US$2,000 (S$2,650) from US$600, leav­ing the fate of the mea­sure un­clear as Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump con­tin­ued to de­mand the larger pay­outs and more Repub­li­cans pub­licly en­dorsed the idea.</p>
    <p>In­stead, Mr McCon­nell, the ma­jor­ity leader, on Tues­day pro­vided vague as­sur­ances that the Se­nate would “be­gin the process” of dis­cussing US$2,000 cheques and two other is­sues that Mr Trump has de­manded that law­mak­ers ad­dress: elec­tion se­cu­rity and re­mov­ing le­gal pro­tec­tions for so­cial me­dia plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Mr McCon­nell, a Repub­li­can, would not say whether he planned sep­a­rate votes on the three is­sues or if he would bring them for a vote on the Se­nate floor at all.</p>
    <p>But in a sign of how he might ap­proach them, the ma­jor­ity leader in­tro­duced new leg­is­la­tion com­bin­ing the US$2,000 cheques, elec­tion se­cu­rity and so­cial me­dia pro­vi­sions into one Bill, which would most likely doom the ef­fort.</p>
    <p>The sud­den talk of elec­tion se­cu­rity com­pli­cates mat­ters, given that Mr Trump con­tin­ues to claim, with­out ev­i­dence, that voter fraud cost him re-elec­tion. Democrats would un­doubt­edly re­sist any­thing that could be seen as try­ing to un­der­mine the out­come of the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr McCon­nell, who has pri­vately urged his con­fer­ence mem­bers not to ob­ject to the elec­tion results when Congress meets on Jan 6 to rat­ify them, por­trayed the Pres­i­dent’s re­quest as “ex­plor­ing fur­ther ways to pro­tect the sanc­tity of Amer­i­can bal­lots”.</p>
    <p>The Bill that Mr McCon­nell is putting to­gether would cre­ate a bi­par­ti­san com­mis­sion to study elec­tion prac­tices that “strength­ened” and that “un­der­mined the in­tegrity of the elec­tion”, like the use of mail-in bal­lots and vote-by-mail pro­ce­dures, which Mr Trump has base­lessly com­plained en­cour­aged voter fraud.</p>
    <p>Mr McCon­nell’s move came as he faced grow­ing pressure from Repub­li­cans to in­crease stim­u­lus pay­ments to strug­gling Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­can sen­a­tors David Per­due and Kelly Lo­ef­fler of Ge­or­gia, who are fac­ing tight run-off elec­tions next week that will de­ter­mine control of the Se­nate, announced on Tues­day that they sup­ported in­creas­ing the size of in­di­vid­ual stim­u­lus cheques to US$2,000.</p>
    <p>They joined a hand­ful of other Repub­li­can sen­a­tors in call­ing for such ac­tion.</p>
    <p>There are five days left in the cur­rent leg­isla­tive ses­sion for the Se­nate to act. The lack of im­me­di­ate ac­tion by the cham­ber ran­kled Mr Trump, who lashed out at law­mak­ers in his own party. The Demo­crat-con­trolled House voted on Mon­day evening to in­crease the size of the stim­u­lus cheques to US$2,000.</p>
