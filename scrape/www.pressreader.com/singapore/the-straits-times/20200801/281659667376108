    <p>In­done­sian po­lice have brought home from Malaysia graft fugi­tive Djoko Soe­gia­rto Tjan­dra, who fled the coun­try 11 years ago af­ter be­ing con­victed in a high-pro­file bank bailout em­bez­zle­ment.</p>
    <p>Na­tional chief de­tec­tive Com­mis­sioner Gen­eral Listyo Sigit told re­porters late on Thurs­day that the ar­rest of Djoko was a re­sult of co­op­er­a­tion be­tween the In­done­sian and Malaysian po­lice forces.</p>
    <p>A hand­cuffed Djoko ar­rived at Halim Per­danakusuma in­ter­na­tional air­port in Jakarta on Thurs­day night flanked by Gen Listyo and his team. They flew from Sul­tan Ab­dul Aziz Shah air­port in Kuala Lumpur us­ing a pri­vate jet hired by the po­lice.</p>
    <p>“Pres­i­dent (Joko Wi­dodo) in­structed us to search for and im­me­di­ately ar­rest Djoko Tjan­dra and get to the bot­tom of his case, so it is all clear,” Gen Listyo told re­porters upon ar­rival at the Jakarta air­port.</p>
    <p>Djoko re­cently made the head­lines when he man­aged to re­turn to In­done­sia un­de­tected and was is­sued a new lo­cal iden­tity card. He also filed a Supreme Court Civil Re­view ap­peal against his two years’ jail sen­tence.</p>
    <p>His case tar­nished the im­age of law en­force­ment un­der Mr Joko’s ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Djoko had first fled to Pa­pua New Guinea in 2009, be­fore he al­legedly moved to live in var­i­ous other coun­tries. He holds a Pa­pua New Guinea pass­port.</p>
    <p>He took a pri­vate jet to Port Moresby in Pa­pua New Guinea from Jakarta on June 10, 2009, just a day be­fore In­done­sia’s Supreme Court slapped him with a two-year jail sen­tence for help­ing to ar­range an il­le­gal 546 bil­lion ru­piah (S$52 mil­lion) fee paid to his com­pany by three trou­bled banks bailed out by the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, In­done­sian po­lice also de­clared lawyer Anita Kolopak­ing a sus­pect. She al­legedly helped to ar­range the is­suance of a new iden­tity card for Djoko and the fil­ing of a court ap­peal on June 8.</p>
    <p>Af­ter re­turn­ing to In­done­sia, for prob­a­bly a few months, Djoko fled to Malaysia via Pon­tianak in West Kal­i­man­tan prov­ince.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said Djoko was as­sisted by three rogue po­lice gen­er­als, who al­legedly pro­vided him with the re­quired travel clear­ances, in­clud­ing an af­fi­davit stat­ing that he had tested neg­a­tive for the coro­n­avirus. The three po­lice of­fi­cers have since been sus­pended and are be­ing in­ves­ti­gated.</p>
