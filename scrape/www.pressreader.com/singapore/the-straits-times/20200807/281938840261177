    <p>Just days af­ter 20 In­dian sol­diers were killed in a bru­tal clash with Chi­nese troops on the Hi­malayan bor­der in June, a group of food de­liv­ery driv­ers in the eastern city of Kolkata found a way to ex­press their out­rage.</p>
    <p>In front of a ban­ner show­ing pho­to­graphs of the slain sol­diers, the driv­ers burned the red uni­forms used by Zo­mato, the Chi­nese-backed food de­liv­ery start-up they worked for. “In­dian army sol­diers have been killed, but Zo­mato loves China,” they chanted as flames en­gulfed the com­pany’s lo­gos.</p>
    <p>The protest ex­em­pli­fied the way in which a burst of na­tion­al­ist anger that fol­lowed the bor­der clash has been di­rected at the bil­lions of dol­lars of Chi­nese in­vest­ment into In­dia’s tech sec­tor.</p>
    <p>The an­i­mos­ity is jeop­ar­dis­ing the po­si­tion that China’s tech groups have rapidly built up in In­dia’s boom­ing start-up scene and has opened the door for US tech com­pa­nies and funds to take on their Chi­nese ri­vals – in­clud­ing Face­book, Google and Ama­zon. As China stumbles, Sil­i­con Val­ley has smelled blood.</p>
    <p>The com­pe­ti­tion be­tween US and Chi­nese tech gi­ants for the In­dian mar­ket is in­tense, with ac­cess to a mar­ket of 1.4 bil­lion peo­ple spurring multi­bil­lion-dol­lar bets. Which­ever com­pa­nies – whether for­eign, for­eign-backed or lo­cal – even­tu­ally seize com­mand­ing po­si­tions in the In­dian mar­ket are likely to have a big in­flu­ence on the fu­ture shape of the global tech­nol­ogy in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>This ri­valry is also tak­ing place amid a broader geopo­lit­i­cal con­test be­tween the United States and China, one where In­dia is be­com­ing an in­creas­ingly im­por­tant fac­tor and where tech­nol­ogy is a cen­tral bat­tle­ground.</p>
    <p>“What’s hap­pen­ing in In­dia rep­re­sents the first time the two ma­jor tech su­per­pow­ers are go­ing head to head not just in a bat­tle but also in a tech war,” says Shang­hai-based part­ner Wil­liam Bao Bean of global ven­ture cap­i­tal com­pany SOSV.</p>
    <p>The re­cent ten­sions, he adds, are push­ing In­dia “to­wards the Amer­i­can ecosys­tem”.</p>
    <p>In­dian Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi has given in­di­ca­tions of a sim­i­lar shift, laud­ing the “US-In­dia friend­ship” on Twit­ter last month. This was not long af­ter a som­bre Mr Modi ap­peared on na­tional tele­vi­sion declar­ing In­dia was “hurt and an­gry” with China fol­low­ing the Hi­malayas in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>En­raged op­po­si­tion lead­ers and for­mer mil­i­tary gen­er­als went even fur­ther, con­demn­ing “Chi­nese ag­gres­sion”. With crowds de­stroy­ing Chi­nese-made elec­tron­ics in street protests in sev­eral cities, New Delhi banned 59 Chi­nese mo­bile apps on the grounds that they were a threat to the coun­try’s se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Fric­tion be­tween the two nu­clear-armed ri­vals is noth­ing new, in­clud­ing the two fight­ing a bor­der war in the 1960s. In­deed, frac­tures in the uneasy Sino-In­dian re­la­tion­ship were al­ready ap­par­ent be­fore the in­ci­dent in the Hi­malayas. Ris­ing anti-Bei­jing sen­ti­ment dur­ing the coro­n­avirus cri­sis prompted New Delhi in April to tighten re­stric­tions on for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment – de­signed to block op­por­tunis­tic Chi­nese takeovers.</p>
    <p>But ex­perts say this is a wa­ter­shed mo­ment.</p>
    <p>“There was a lot of work put into In­dia-China re­la­tions in the past 30 years; most of that has been re­set,” says In­dian ven­ture cap­i­tal fund Iron Pil­lar man­ag­ing part­ner</p>
    <p>Anand Prasanna. “This is a turn­ing point for Chi­nese in­vest­ment in In­dia tech.”</p>
    <p>CHI­NESE DEALS DRY­ING UP</p>
    <p>The boom in Chi­nese in­ter­est in In­dian tech is a rel­a­tively re­cent phe­nom­e­non. As re­cently as five years ago, Chi­nese tech in­vest­ment in the vast In­dian sub­con­ti­nent was neg­li­gi­ble. This then ex­ploded in 2017 and 2018, led by Alibaba and Ten­cent. Chi­nese ven­ture cap­i­tal in­vest­ments in In­dia to­talled</p>
    <p>US$4.3 bil­lion (S$5.9 bil­lion) be­tween the start of 2017 and June this year.</p>
    <p>The sense that China’s tech lead­ers have seen In­dia as a sec­ond home mar­ket is borne out by the pro­file of their in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>Among In­dia’s top 10 tech uni­corns – start-up com­pa­nies val­ued at more than US$1 bil­lion – seven are backed by a Chi­nese strate­gic in­vestor, against only one that is backed by a US equiv­a­lent.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese back­ing also ex­tends well be­yond the top 10. Re­search by Gate­way House, a Mum­bai-based think-tank, shows that out of In­dia’s 30 ex­ist­ing uni­corns, 18 are funded ei­ther by China’s big tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies or by Chi­nese ven­ture cap­i­tal funds.</p>
    <p>“They are try­ing to recre­ate in In­dia what they have al­ready done in China,” says Gate­way House fel­low Amit Bhan­dari.</p>
    <p>Alibaba and Ten­cent, in par­tic­u­lar, have shown a clear in­tent to build net­works of port­fo­lio com­pa­nies that have the po­ten­tial to mu­tu­ally re­in­force one an­other’s op­er­a­tions in In­dia.</p>
    <p>As in China – where Alibaba bol­sters its e-com­merce brands such as Taobao and Tmall with a dig­i­tal pay­ments busi­ness Ali­pay; so­cial me­dia via Weibo; dig­i­tal en­ter­tain­ment through Youku; and lo­gis­tics through Cainiao – the group is build­ing stakes in a col­lec­tion of In­dian and South-east Asian start-ups.</p>
    <p>In In­dia, Alibaba Group com­pa­nies have in­vested in Snapdeal, one of the coun­try’s big­gest e-com­merce sites; BigBas­ket, an on­line su­per­mar­ket; Paytm, a lead­ing pay­ments app; Dai­ly­hunt, a news site that serves con­tent in 14 lo­cal lan­guages; XpressBees, a par­cel ser­vice; Zo­mato for food de­liv­ery; and sev­eral oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Ten­cent shows the same ap­proach, hav­ing in­vested in e-com­merce, on­line ed­u­ca­tion, food de­liv­ery, fan­tasy sports, a busi­ness-to-busi­ness com­merce site and sev­eral other start-ups in In­dia. To a lesser ex­tent, other Chi­nese com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing Meituan Dian­ping, ByteDance, Xiaomi and Didi Chux­ing, are fol­low­ing sim­i­lar strate­gies.</p>
    <p>At the same time, dozens of China’s big­gest mo­bile phone apps have flour­ished in In­dia. Ac­cord­ing to Sen­sor Tower, a US com­pany that tracks apps, the three most pop­u­lar Chi­nese apps from In­dia’s Ap­ple and Google Play stores – UC Browser, TikTok and SHAREit – have had more than one bil­lion down­loads since 2014.</p>
    <p>Zo­mato, founded in 2008, has re­ceived pro­posed fund­ing of US$560 mil­lion – more than half of what it has raised to date – from</p>
    <p>Ant Fi­nan­cial, the pay­ments af­fil­i­ate of Alibaba, to fuel its blis­ter­ing growth.</p>
    <p>Zo­mato co-founder and chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer Gau­rav Gupta says there is no doubt over the role played by Ant Fi­nan­cial in his com­pany’s de­vel­op­ment. Not only did the Chi­nese com­pany come with deep pock­ets, it also trans­ferred knowl­edge on how to “scale fast” and “pen­e­trate deep”, Mr Gupta says.</p>
    <p>But the fallout from the po­lit­i­cal ten­sions be­tween New Delhi and Bei­jing has al­ready de­layed fund­ing for young com­pa­nies such as Zo­mato, closely tied to China. At least US$100 mil­lion of that money from Ant Fi­nan­cial has been de­layed ow­ing to the un­cer­tainty over how the new for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment rules will af­fect pre­vi­ously an­nounced in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>Zo­mato is no iso­lated case. There are al­ready signs this record flow of money is slow­ing down.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of fund-rais­ing deals in­volv­ing one or more Chi­nese in­vestors fell from six in Jan­uary this year to zero in June, ac­cord­ing to Refini­tiv, a data provider. By com­par­i­son, there were nine ven­ture cap­i­tal deals in­volv­ing a US in­vestor in June.</p>
    <p>“It’s def­i­nitely led to some re­duc­tion in com­pe­ti­tion in deals,” says con­sul­tancy Praxis Global Al­liance man­ag­ing direc­tor Mad­hur Sing­hal.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese mo­bile apps, which have pro­lif­er­ated across In­dia, are an­other ca­su­alty. New Delhi’s ban on some of China’s big­gest apps in late June was a par­tic­u­lar blow for video-stream­ing app TikTok, which is owned by Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy group ByteDance and has more than 200 mil­lion users in In­dia, count­ing it as its big­gest over­seas mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Long-sim­mer­ing pub­lic dis­con­tent is even ar­tic­u­lated by com­pa­nies that have ben­e­fited from Chi­nese money.</p>
    <p>Mr Yashish Dahiya, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Pol­i­cyBazaar, a US$1.65 bil­lion in­sur­ance ag­gre­ga­tor in In­dia, of which Ten­cent holds a 10 per cent stake, is blunt.</p>
    <p>“I think for the last 30 years, the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment has not played by the rules. They like to play by the rules when it is to their ad­van­tage, but they don’t pro­vide the same rules to out­siders in their coun­try.”</p>
    <p>BUY­ING THE ‘IN­DIA STORY’</p>
    <p>It is in this febrile cli­mate that Sil­i­con Val­ley has seized its golden mo­ment. Mr Modi’s warm words that the US and In­dia were “nat­u­ral part­ners” came hot on the heels of a num­ber of deals by US Big Tech.</p>
    <p>Last month, Google pledged US$10 bil­lion of in­vest­ment in In­dia as part of a vague but nonethe­less im­pres­sive-sound­ing “In­dia digi­ti­sa­tion fund”. That same week the search com­pany an­nounced it would in­vest US$4.5 bil­lion in Jio Plat­forms, the fast-grow­ing dig­i­tal busi­ness owned by In­dia’s rich­est man Mukesh Am­bani, that spans ev­ery­thing from telecoms to e-com­merce to video stream­ing. The Google deal fol­lowed a US$5.7 bil­lion in­vest­ment by Face­book in Jio in April.</p>
    <p>Al­though much of this re­cent deal-mak­ing has been fo­cused on a sin­gle com­pany, Jio, it builds on ear­lier in­vest­ments and at­tempts to ap­peal to In­dia’s young and dig­i­tally savvy mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Google Pay has be­come the big­gest dig­i­tal pay­ments provider in In­dia af­ter its launch in the coun­try in 2017. Ac­cord­ing to a May re­port by Bern­stein, Google Pay led the pay­ments mar­ket in In­dia, fol­lowed by PhonePe, the dig­i­tal pay­ments unit of Wal­mart-owned Flip­kart, Ama­zon Pay and lastly Paytm, the US$16 bil­lion mar­ket dar­ling backed by Alibaba. In­dia is also Face­book’s big­gest mar­ket in terms of users and the com­pany is set to launch its own What­sApp Pay ser­vice im­mi­nently.</p>
    <p>The ap­proach of US in­vestors – aside from pay­ments – had un­til now been quite dif­fer­ent to their Chi­nese ri­vals.</p>
    <p>“US in­vestors (were) mostly funds while Chi­nese in­vestors are the In­ter­net gi­ants seek­ing to recre­ate the ecosys­tems they have at home,” says Mr Bhan­dari of Gate­way House.</p>
    <p>The main ex­cep­tion had been Flip­kart, In­dia’s lead­ing e-com­merce site, which was bought for US$16 bil­lion by Wal­mart in May 2018 af­ter the US re­tailer bought the stakes of sev­eral in­vestors, in­clud­ing Ten­cent, Naspers, eBay and Mi­crosoft.</p>
    <p>But now, says Blume Ven­tures co-founder Karthik Reddy, an in­vestor in start-ups, the anti-China sen­ti­ment and takeover fears which led to the for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment (FDI) rule change have al­ready tilted the play­ing field to­wards US in­vestors.</p>
    <p>“Jio is a fun­da­men­tal ex­am­ple of that,” he says, re­fer­ring to the wave of US in­vestors that have fol­lowed Face­book and Google into the plat­form, in­clud­ing pri­vate eq­uity groups Sil­ver Lake and KKR. “The Amer­i­cans are buy­ing more and more into the In­dian story.”</p>
    <p>WARN­ING SIGNS FOR IN­VESTORS</p>
    <p>The harsh turn in sen­ti­ment against China un­der­scores the capri­cious na­ture of in­vest­ing in emerg­ing mar­kets, even one as dy­namic as In­dia. For any for­eign in­vestor, in­clud­ing those from the US, the risk of be­ing hit with new reg­u­la­tions re­mains high. In­dia has re­peat­edly used such tac­tics to as­sert lo­cal con­trol over suc­cess­ful in­ter­na­tional busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Europe’s Cairn En­ergy has been bogged down by a bat­tle over US$1.6 bil­lion in retroac­tive tax de­mands. Voda­fone’s In­dian joint ven­ture has also warned it may “shut shop” af­ter be­ing slapped with retroac­tive levies.</p>
    <p>Wal­mart in­vested in Flip­kart only to have the e-com­merce rules changed in favour of do­mes­tic ri­vals af­ter its en­try into the mar­ket. When Ama­zon founder Jeff Be­zos went to In­dia in Jan­uary, Com­merce Min­is­ter Piyush Goyal de­clared that the ty­coon’s in­vest­ment was no big “favour” to In­dia.</p>
    <p>UberEats’ fate in the food de­liv­ery sec­tor serves as an­other cau­tion­ary tale. On a well-pub­li­cised visit in 2016, Uber’s erst­while boss Travis Kalan­ick met In­dian cricket su­per­star Sachin Ten­dulkar and dis­cussed movies with Bol­ly­wood star Sal­man Khan. He told lo­cal me­dia that his com­pany “couldn’t be more ex­cited to serve In­dia”.</p>
    <p>UberEats be­gan busi­ness in Mum­bai in 2017 in an initiative that se­nior ex­ec­u­tives de­scribed as a “ma­jor step in our global ex­pan­sion”. But by the end of last year it was in re­treat.</p>
    <p>It could not with­stand the “burn rate” re­quired to com­pete against the su­pe­rior fi­nan­cial fire­power of Zo­mato and its ri­val, Swiggy, which is backed by Ten­cent and Meituan Dian­ping, China’s big­gest food de­liv­ery plat­form. In Jan­uary, Uber agreed to sell its food de­liv­ery busi­ness in In­dia to Zo­mato in ex­change for tak­ing a mi­nor­ity stake.</p>
    <p>In­deed there are fears that in­vestor en­thu­si­asm for the coun­try may have run far ahead of re­al­ity. The losses racked up by Zo­mato, Swiggy and UberEats in In­dia’s food de­liv­ery sec­tor are by no means un­usual.</p>
    <p>There is also some scep­ti­cism over the frenzy of deal-mak­ing into four-year-old Jio Plat­forms which has raised US$20 bil­lion from global in­vestors in the past three months alone. Mr Am­bani now says he has elim­i­nated US$20 bil­lion in net debt.</p>
    <p>“Com­pa­nies have ef­fec­tively given Jio US$20 bil­lion to spon­sor its debt,” says one Asia-based fund man­ager, re­fer­ring to how Mr Am­bani has long wanted to make Re­liance In­dus­tries debt-free.</p>
    <p>The mentality in the tech in­dus­try, how­ever, is that it is bet­ter to spend big and build a dom­i­nant po­si­tion rather than lose out on the most lu­cra­tive growth mar­ket for for­eign com­pa­nies. In spite of the losses, in­vestors are pil­ing into the ev­er­more com­pet­i­tive land­scape.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts think China is down but not out. Chi­nese com­pa­nies have not been to­tally frozen out of In­dia by the FDI rules, says Mr Sing­hal. Even Ant Fi­nan­cial and Zo­mato are “con­fi­dent” the US$100 mil­lion in limbo will even­tu­ally go through, burnt com­pany shirts and all.</p>
    <p>Mr Bao Bean says it is too soon to de­clare the US the win­ner, though the China side was def­i­nitely “caught off guard” by the events of the past few months. “Chi­nese tech and money are still very strong in In­dia,” he says. “This is just one win for the Amer­i­can In­ter­net lead­ers.”</p>
    <p>The fallout from the po­lit­i­cal ten­sions be­tween New Delhi and Bei­jing has al­ready de­layed fund­ing for young com­pa­nies such as Zo­mato, closely tied to China...</p>
    <p>Zo­mato is no iso­lated case. There are al­ready signs this record flow of money is slow­ing down. The num­ber of fund-rais­ing deals in­volv­ing one or more Chi­nese in­vestors fell from six in Jan­uary this year to zero in June, ac­cord­ing to Refini­tiv, a data provider. By com­par­i­son, there were nine ven­ture cap­i­tal deals in­volv­ing a US in­vestor in June.</p>
    <p>It is in this febrile cli­mate that Sil­i­con Val­ley has seized its golden mo­ment. In­dian PM Naren­dra Modi’s warm words that the US and In­dia were “nat­u­ral part­ners” came hot on the heels of a num­ber of deals by US Big Tech...</p>
