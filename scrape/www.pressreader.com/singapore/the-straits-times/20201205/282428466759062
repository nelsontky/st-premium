    <p>•</p>
    <p>Opec and other oil-pro­duc­ing na­tions led by Rus­sia, try­ing to gauge the strength of the global econ­omy as the coro­n­avirus con­tin­ues to rage but with vac­cines on the hori­zon, have reached a com­pro­mise to mod­estly in­crease pro­duc­tion net month.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the talks re­vealed strains i n the un­wieldy group known as Opec+, which has tried to man­age the oil mar­ket since 2016. These ten­sions could make it more dif­fi­cult for the pro­duc­ers to stay in line with pro­duc­tion tar­gets as the global econ­omy re­cov­ers in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>Un­der the agree­ment on Thurs­day, mem­bers of the Or­gan­i­sa­tion of the Petroleum Ex­port­ing Coun­tries, along with Rus­sia and other coun­tries, will in­crease pro­duc­tion by 500,000 bar­rels a day (bpd) in Jan­uary and, po­ten­tially, by a sim­i­lar amount in the fol­low­ing two months. The in­crease, less than 1 per cent of the global oil mar­ket, comes while de­mand is still un­der pres­sure from the ef­fects of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The group will also hold monthly meet­ings to sign off on fur­ther ad­just­ments.</p>
    <p>The ar­range­ment was a com­pro­mise be­tween coun­tries that wanted to pro­ceed with a much larger in­crease of two mil­lion bpd, which had been agreed upon at an ear­lier meet­ing, and others, led by Saudi Ara­bia, that pre­ferred to main­tain cur­rent pro­duc­tion cuts, es­ti­mated at 7.7 mil­lion bpd, given</p>
    <p>the un­cer­tain­ties stem­ming from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Reach­ing a deal had been sur­pris­ingly dif­fi­cult. The meet­ing on Thurs­day had been de­layed for two days while of­fi­cials strug­gled to reach a con­sen­sus.</p>
    <p>The re­cent news about the ef­fi­cacy of vac­cines to ward off the coro­n­avirus, which has caused oil prices to climb to their high­est lev­els since they crashed in April, prob­a­bly made it harder to reach an agree­ment. Re­spond­ing to those higher prices, some oil pro­duc­ers saw less need to keep sup­plies tight and wanted to in­crease pump­ing to try to make up for al­most a year of dis­mal oil earn­ings.</p>
    <p>“As prices rise, the will­ing­ness to re­strain sup­plies withers,” said Mr Bhushan Bahree, an ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor at IHS Markit, a re­search firm.</p>
    <p>What was strik­ing was that the United Arab Emi­rates (UAE), long the clos­est ally of Saudi Ara­bia, Opec’s de facto leader, proved dif­fi­cult to cor­ral. An­a­lysts say the UAE’s am­bi­tious lead­ers are irri</p>
    <p>tated about sev­eral is­sues, in­clud­ing a tight quota that sharply crimps their plans to sub­stan­tially in­crease oil pro­duc­tion and the Saudi-Rus­sia dom­i­na­tion of oil de­ci­sion-mak­ing in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts in­clud­ing Mr Bahree say the coun­try, the third-largest pro­ducer in Opec af­ter Saudi Ara­bia and Iraq, may be con­sid­er­ing go­ing its own way in oil mat­ters.</p>
    <p>“They don’t want to be side­lined and just be a fol­lower,” said Ms Am­rita Sen, head of oil anal­y­sis at mar­ket re­search firm En­ergy As­pects.</p>
    <p>Out of frus­tra­tion with the dif­fi­culty of forg­ing a con­sen­sus, Prince Ab­du­laziz bin Sal­man, the Saudi oil min­is­ter and chair­man of the Opec+ meet­ings, of­fered on Mon­day to re­sign from the chair­man­ship of an in­flu­en­tial com­mit­tee that pre­pares the way for de­ci­sions by the group.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to an Opec news re­lease on Thurs­day, the oil pro­duc­ers urged him to con­tinue lead­ing the com­mit­tee as well as Opec+ meet­ings, say­ing his ef­forts were “highly ap­pre­ci­ated”.</p>
