    <p>SYD­NEY • Be it stocks, bonds or al­most any other as­set class, for­eign cash is pour­ing into Asia on bets it will be the fastest-grow­ing re­gion as the world re­cov­ers from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The MSCI Asia Pa­cific In­dex rose to a record last week and a Bloomberg Bar­clays bond in­dex is close to its high­est in four years. The re­gion’s cur­ren­cies are, on ag­gre­gate, the strong­est since 2018 and com­modi­ties are also climb­ing. Lit­tle won­der when a Cit­i­group gauge of eco­nomic sur­prises in the re­gion is at a level last seen in 2007.</p>
    <p>The pos­i­tive af­ter­math of the United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, en­cour­ag­ing progress on vac­cines, abun­dant liq­uid­ity and an “im­prov­ing growth pulse” in Asia have driven de­mand for the re­gion’s as­sets, said Aus­tralia and New Zealand Bank­ing Group head of Asia re­search Khoon Goh.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pect a con­trolled virus sit­u­a­tion, im­proved global growth and am­ple liq­uid­ity to spur fur­ther in­flows into the re­gion,” he wrote in a note on Tues­day. “We ex­pected con­tin­ued strong in­flows over the course of 2021, which will be sup­port­ive of Asia’s as­set mar­kets.”</p>
    <p>In­vestors last week added the most money to emerg­ing-mar­ket ex­change-traded funds (ETFs) since Jan­uary, and the in­flows were dom­i­nated by Asia, data com­piled by Bloomberg showed.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese and Hong Kong funds saw the big­gest de­mand, South Korean ETFs had a record in­flow while no in­di­vid­ual coun­try suf­fered an out­flow.</p>
    <p>On the fixed-in­come side, the ap­petite for Asia is also grow­ing. For­eign hold­ings of China’s debt have surged to a record 1.79 tril­lion yuan (S$366 bil­lion), and global funds have bought more than US$2.5 bil­lion (S$3.3 bil­lion) of high-yield­ing In­done­sian sov­er­eign bonds this quar­ter, the most since Septem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>Still, some strate­gists cau­tion that the rush could slow, not least be­cause in­flows into China due to its in­clu­sion in global bond in­dices could ta­per off.</p>
    <p>“For­eign in­vestor de­mand is likely to slow in De­cem­ber and in early 2021, as China’s in­clu­sion in two of the ma­jor in­dices is nearly com­plete,” Bar­clays an­a­lysts Ashish Agrawal and Yile Gu wrote on Tues­day. “For­eign in­vestor flows are also show­ing signs of slow­ing in the other mar­kets.”</p>
    <p>But for now, the en­thu­si­asm has even seeped into the de­riv­a­tives mar­ket, with Credit Suisse Group strate­gist Mandy Xu high­light­ing strong bullish flow for call op­tions on Asian eq­ui­ties.</p>
    <p>The re­cov­ery in China’s econ­omy is a large part of the Asian at­trac­tion. Chi­nese ex­ports jumped last month by the most since early 2018, push­ing China’s trade sur­plus to a monthly record high.</p>
    <p>Im­ports have also surged as Chi­nese fac­to­ries ramp up pro­duc­tion. This has helped push iron ore futures in Sin­ga­pore to an all­time high. China is also buck­ing the global trend of greater eco­nomic stim­u­lus amid the coro­n­avirus, pre­fer­ring to re­fo­cus on con­trol­ling its record debt bur­den.</p>
    <p>“One rea­son why we think Asia looks so good, par­tic­u­larly north Asia, is that it had to spend less money keep­ing the economies go­ing,” DWS Group chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer for Asia-Pa­cific Sean Tay­lor said last week. Other coun­tries have taken debt that “is go­ing to af­fect growth rates and that’s why the medium-term rally is rel­a­tively good for Asia”.</p>
    <p>The pos­i­tive af­ter­math of the United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, en­cour­ag­ing progress on vac­cines, abun­dant liq­uid­ity and an “im­prov­ing growth pulse” in Asia have driven de­mand for the re­gion’s as­sets, said Aus­tralia and New Zealand Bank­ing Group head of Asia re­search Khoon Goh.</p>
