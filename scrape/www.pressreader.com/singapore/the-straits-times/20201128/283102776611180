    <p>• On a dark­ened res­i­den­tial street in Paris, a gate left partly open sig­nals the en­trance to an aban­doned train tun­nel – and an il­le­gal rave party for 300 peo­ple look­ing for an es­cape from France’s Covid-19 lock­down.</p>
    <p>“Close the door,” whis­pers a door­man hid­den in the shad­ows, ush­er­ing to­wards tracks lit only by rev­eller’s phones. The €15 (S$24) tick­ets for the Satur­day soiree, ti­tled “I Want to Break Free”, were sold to mem­bers of a pri­vate Face­book group and snapped up within hours.</p>
    <p>But the ad­dress in the 13th ar­rondisse­ment was kept se­cret un­til the last minute and the rules were strict: Ar­rive alone, or in groups of two or three max­i­mum, be­tween 8 and 9pm.</p>
    <p>Puls­ing techno mu­sic beck­oned from a vast un­der­ground cav­ern some 20m high, fes­tooned with lights and neon that framed the psy­che­delic i mages be­ing pro­jected on the walls. Dancers swarmed the dusty floor com­plete with a DJ stage and a bar.</p>
    <p>“We de­cided to mount a re­sis­tance and is­sue this call to hide to­gether and party be­cause there’s no longer any place for young peo­ple to be to­gether,” says the 27-year-old or­gan­iser, who de­clined to give his real name but asked to be called Alexan­dre.</p>
    <p>“We know how to do this now. In less than two hours we can set up any­where and have a very pri­vate party like this,” he said.</p>
    <p>If caught, Alexan­dre could be fined up to €15,000 on charges of reck­less en­dan­ger­ment.</p>
    <p>Seated on tracks that vi­brated from the blar­ing speak­ers, Ivan, 23, and his girl­friend watched as peo­ple poured in, the ma­jor­ity with­out face masks.</p>
    <p>“I just got my first job, a per­ma­nent con­tract, and I’ve been work­ing a lot so I re­ally needed to blow off some steam,” he said. “The lock­down has knocked my life out of bal­ance; I haven’t left my apart­ment in a month – this party is nec­es­sary for my men­tal health.”</p>
    <p>The sen­ti­ment is ap­par­ently widespread, since French po­lice have had to crack down on dozens of il­le­gal par­ties since the par­tial lock­down was an­nounced last month to com­bat a new surge in coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>Last Sun­day, the po­lice shut down a party at a pri­vate home in Joinville-Le-Pont, just west of Paris, and is­sued fines to around 15 peo­ple for flout­ing the lock­down, said a source close to the in­quiry.</p>
    <p>It came just a week after a huge gath­er­ing of nearly 400 peo­ple was held at the same ad­dress, lead­ing to charges against the house’s owner and a se­cu­rity guard at the event. But no of­fi­cers showed up to shut down the Paris party, said a po­lice source.</p>
    <p>“Gen­er­ally, we take ac­tion against se­cret par­ties when neigh­bours com­plain, about the noise es­pe­cially,” the source said.</p>
