    <p>LON­DON • Johnny Depp (right) was the vic­tim of in­vented al­le­ga­tions and phys­i­cal vi­o­lence from his for­mer wife Am­ber Heard, Lon­don’s High Court was told on Tues­day, the fi­nal day of the Hol­ly­wood ac­tor’s three-week li­bel suit against a Bri­tish tabloid.</p>
    <p>Depp, the star of film se­ries Pirates Of The Caribbean (2003 to 2017), is su­ing News Group News­pa­pers, pub­lish­ers of The Sun, and one of its jour­nal­ists, Mr Dan Woot­ton, over a 2018 ar­ti­cle that called him a “wife beater”.</p>
    <p>Depp, 57, and Heard, 34, both gave ev­i­dence at the trial.</p>
    <p>Depp said he had never been vi­o­lent to­wards the ac­tress or any other wo­man and that she was the one who had at­tacked him.</p>
    <p>Heard said Depp as­saulted her on at least 14 oc­ca­sions, i nclud­ing punch­ing, head-butting and throt­tling her and, on Mon­day, her lawyer said Depp was “a hope­less ad­dict”.</p>
    <p>In his clos­ing speech, Depp’s lawyer David Sher­borne said while Depp had been open about his use of drugs and al­co­hol, Heard had played down her con­sump­tion of them as well as her anger and jeal­ousy is­sues.</p>
    <p>“She is the abuser, not Mr Depp. He is no wife beater,” Mr Sher­borne told the court.</p>
    <p>He said Heard was a “wholly un­re­li­able wit­ness and, frankly, com­pul­sive liar”, who had tailored her story to meet the ev­i­dence pro­duced against her and lied about in­juries she said she had suf­fered.</p>
    <p>A record­ing was played to the court in which Depp tells Heard she is ly­ing when she says she did not punch him, which Mr Sher­borne said demon­strated Heard’s “propen­sity to vi­o­lence”.</p>
    <p>“Don’t tell me what it feels like to be punched,” Depp said in the record­ing, be­fore Heard re­torts: “I hit you like this. But I did not punch you.”</p>
    <p>Mr Sher­borne said the ad­mis­sion that Heard hit Depp would have caused “con­ster­na­tion” if the roles were re­versed.</p>
    <p>“He has never hit a wo­man in his en­tire life. Pe­riod, full stop, nada,” Mr Sher­borne said.</p>
    <p>He said The Sun’s ar­ti­cle was “not re­searched at all” and pre­sented in a one-sided man­ner, ef­fec­tively con­vict­ing Depp of a crime he had never com­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>Heard gave a state­ment out­side the court, say­ing it had been painful to re­live the break-up and have her truth and mo­tives ques­tioned.</p>
    <p>“I stand by my tes­ti­mony and I now place my faith in Bri­tish jus­tice,” she said. A date for the rul­ing was not given.</p>
