    <p>It’s dawn, my favourite time of day.</p>
    <p>Ho­tel Cal­i­for­nia is play­ing on my iPhone. Time to make a list of things I want to achieve for the day, de­tailed enough to stay mo­ti­vated, but not so lengthy as to get dis­cour­aged.</p>
    <p>An­other day in Ho­tel Q, locked in for two weeks early last month in down­town Sin­ga­pore. Thank good­ness for a bal­cony, with a view of nor­mal life in the pool be­low and ten­nis courts beyond.</p>
    <p>Life for the past eight years has been in Wash­ing­ton, DC. The Covid-19 case num­bers are not en­cour­ag­ing in the United States and not ev­ery­one re­spects maskwear­ing pro­to­col, so we have been largely self-iso­lat­ing since March.</p>
    <p>It is like be­ing ma­rooned on the other side of the world.</p>
    <p>So I was look­ing for­ward to ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a flight again to Sin­ga­pore, but that was the first jolt.</p>
    <p>I was one of only five pas­sen­gers on the empty plane. And I have never seen Changi Air­port so de­serted, pop­u­lated only with uni­formed staff to guide us through.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond jolt, of course, was ho­tel quar­an­tine. Two weeks in a room with nowhere to go and no hu­man con­tact is daunt­ing.</p>
    <p>I reached out to my niece Rhean Up­pal to get ad­vice. She was asymp­to­matic Covid-19-pos­i­tive when she re­turned from Lon­don in March, and had been through a painful 31 days in a Sin­ga­pore fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>To­gether, we came up with 10 prac­ti­cal must-dos and must-haves which may help get oth­ers through it.</p>
    <p>1 FOOD NET­WORK</p>
    <p>This is the sin­gle big­gest com­plaint at all Ho­tel Quar­an­tines, so ob­vi­ous when you see mul­ti­ple In­sta­gram posts of sad prison-like trays of moun­tains of car­bo­hy­drates.</p>
    <p>Set up a net­work of friends for food de­liv­er­ies. Re­mem­ber, there is no fridge, only a mini­bar that cools drinks but does not keep food fresh.</p>
    <p>Re­mind friends who are send­ing meals to ap­proach this one day at a time.</p>
    <p>Ask for fruit, nuts, the health­i­est gra­nola pos­si­ble, UHT milk in small car­tons that will keep. Also, things which save you from crav­ing un­healthy snacks.</p>
    <p>Down­load those life-sav­ing food de­liv­ery apps. Ho­tel staff de­liver parcels very ef­fi­ciently to your room.</p>
    <p>2 MU­SIC</p>
    <p>Mu­sic was our great­est com­pan­ion. I wish I had taken along a bet­ter speaker to fill the quiet with mu­sic to match my mood and help break the si­lence. My niece would put on a pod­cast just to feel the com­fort of a hu­man pres­ence.</p>
    <p>3 DAILY AGENDA</p>
    <p>I had am­bi­tious “down­time” projects I had saved for Ho­tel Quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing digi­tised 30 years of family videos, this was my chance to now edit them.</p>
    <p>I had promised a friend to help out with a re­gional con­fer­ence on phi­lan­thropy now that I was in the same time zone.</p>
    <p>There were half-fin­ished re­ports from work and fi­nal edit­ing of a book I had been work­ing on since last year.</p>
    <p>The big list went up early on a neon post-it on the empty wall, then just sat there unticked for days.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem is, I had to break this daunt­ing agenda into bite-size daily bits.</p>
    <p>“If used well, quar­an­tine is ac­tu­ally a fan­tas­tic op­por­tu­nity to set a good-habit streak, and do tasks you’ve al­ways wanted to do,” my niece wisely re­minds me.</p>
    <p>“When I was in quar­an­tine, I got a vir­tual in­tern­ship and it forced me to learn about UX De­sign.</p>
    <p>“It also took my mind off feel­ing sorry for my­self, and onto look­ing ahead and build­ing my ca­reer.”</p>
    <p>4 TIME OUT</p>
    <p>Sched­ule in an un­apolo­getic break. It helps split up a very long day.</p>
    <p>For me, the af­ter­noons were Net­flix time. I found an in­ter­est­ing cou­ple of movies and tele­vi­sion dra­mas, and binged till I could feel my bat­ter­ies recharge and re­boot, ready to tackle the rest of the day.</p>
    <p>My niece agrees. “I caught up on the old movies I’d watched when I was young but never fully un­der­stood, like the Ter­mi­na­tor films.”</p>
    <p>5 CAMP­ING 101</p>
    <p>Your room is re­ally like a mini­home for two weeks.</p>
    <p>Your ho­tel may not pro­vide dish­wash­ing liq­uid and a sponge, or even laun­dry pow­der, which would be help­ful as you prob­a­bly won’t have a big enough load to war­rant ho­tel ser­vices.</p>
    <p>I asked for a proper din­ner plate and real cut­lery, feel­ing more civilised not eat­ing out of plas­tic boxes with flimsy plas­tic spoons.</p>
    <p>Get the soft­est py­ja­mas or stay in your ath­leisure wear. For the oc­ca­sional Zoom call, I would grab a scarf or a jacket.</p>
    <p>My niece has dif­fer­ent ad­vice: “I didn’t stay in py­ja­mas all day for fear of be­com­ing too re­laxed and lethar­gic. My clothes fol­lowed my strict sleep­ing/wak­ing rou­tine. I made sure that once I got up, I made the bed and never crawled back un­less I needed a short nap.”</p>
    <p>6 HU­MAN CON­NEC­TION</p>
    <p>For an ex­tro­vert like me, this was the hard­est chal­lenge. Some­how, all those chats and apps and even calls did not lift my spir­its.</p>
    <p>Then it dawned on me that I had not seen a hu­man face for days. As each meal in a plas­tic bag was hung on the room door with a knock, I would rush to say “hello”, but the staff had fled.</p>
    <p>Soon, I asked friends to use the video func­tion when chat­ting, and that made all the dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>I had a brain­wave. Why not re­con­nect with friends across the globe, with re­la­tion­ships that had been swal­lowed up in the rush of daily life?</p>
    <p>Sud­denly, I was trans­ported to homes in Madrid, apart­ments in Swe­den, a joglo in ru­ral Yo­gya and en­joy­ing the lush gar­dens of Sin­tra in Por­tu­gal. And I was re-meet­ing their whole family, say­ing hi to kids who had grown up too fast, par­ents grow­ing older, pets.</p>
    <p>That trans­ported me out of my cage for long enough to bring real cheer.</p>
    <p>7 SELF-CARE PACK</p>
    <p>Lux­u­ri­ate a lit­tle – you have noth­ing but time. I asked friends for face masks and good bath salts for the soak in the tub. Ask for ice and en­joy an evening sun­downer drink. Cel­e­brate that you have got through an­other day.</p>
    <p>8 COUNT­DOWN CAL­EN­DAR</p>
    <p>Op­ti­mism is re­newed with a sense of pro­gres­sion.</p>
    <p>Make your own 14-day count­down and it will bring the same joys as your child­hood ad­vent cal­en­dar.</p>
    <p>You can mark it with the “ex­cit­ing” visit of the Per­son from the Min­istry who will come to check on you, your big Covid-19 test on Day 11 or your fi­nal re­lease to the out­side world.</p>
    <p>My niece loves this idea, though her cir­cum­stances were very dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>“I couldn’t re­ally do the count­down be­cause there was no set date that I was go­ing to be re­leased. I would just wait ev­ery four days for the next Covid-19 test. The re­sults al­ways came out pos­i­tive, week af­ter week.</p>
    <p>“Even­tu­ally, I stopped hop­ing and adopted a stoic at­ti­tude. I had to avoid be­ing dis­ap­pointed and end­ing up in tears, so I just threw my­self into my rou­tine. It was the hard­est thing I have ever done.”</p>
    <p>9 EX­ER­CISE</p>
    <p>I came pre­pared with a yoga mat, stretchy bands and a sub­scrip­tion to my favourite on­line yoga classes (doyo­gaw­ithme.com).</p>
    <p>What I for­got was aer­o­bic ac­tiv­ity, then I dis­cov­ered on­line walk­ing pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>My su­per-fit niece took along her dumb­bells and re­sis­tance bands. “I even used a broom­stick and put weights on each side to do squats. It was a fun time to get cre­ative.</p>
    <p>“I watched a lot of Yoga With Adriene, and cal­is­thenic pro­grammes on YouTube.”</p>
    <p>10 DAILY NEWS­PA­PER</p>
    <p>Read­ing the morn­ing news­pa­per helped re­mind me of the world out­side, plus added a nice rou­tine to the day.</p>
    <p>Yes, the news­pa­pers are on­line, but there is a spe­cial plea­sure leaf­ing through a copy of The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>FRESH FO­CUS</p>
    <p>Quar­an­tine was like a good de­tox.</p>
    <p>It started with a painful break­down and elim­i­na­tion of the old tox­ins, then a re­build­ing with re­newed in­sights, fo­cus and en­ergy.</p>
    <p>As one starts slow­ing down, set­tling in, turn­ing in­wards, it gets eas­ier.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, as you emerge on the other side, there is not just res­ig­na­tion to this un­avoid­able iso­la­tion, but ac­tual joy in hav­ing had ex­pan­sive empty space and time to ex­plore and ex­per­i­ment and find a new fo­cus.</p>
    <p>I re­call some friends re­cently as­sur­ing me: “The first four days are re­ally the hard­est.”</p>
    <p>Hur­ray for hav­ing sur­vived all 14 and 31 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>• Gouri Mir­puri is cur­rently posted in Wash­ing­ton, DC. Her niece, Rhean Up­pal, is a sec­ond-year un­der­grad­u­ate in Lon­don.</p>
    <p>Both are proud Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>SPAIN: Fabada as­turi­ana and co­cido madrileno</p>
    <p>As­turias, the re­gion of north-west Spain, is known for its rugged coast, re­li­gious sites and fabada as­turi­ana – a bean stew made with lo­cally grown white beans, veg­eta­bles and As­turias blood sausage.</p>
    <p>Die-hard fans know the best time to visit Spain is in March dur­ing Cul­tural Bean Week, to sam­ple the best fabada cooked by the coun­try’s best chefs in a friendly culi­nary bat­tle.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, in Madrid, a fra­grant bean dish called co­cido madrileno not only feeds Span­ish fam­i­lies on week­ends, but it also tells the in­te­gra­tion story of Spain’s Sephardic Jews. The Jews cre­ated this revered dish so they could cook it ahead of time and eat well dur­ing Shab­bat, their day of rest.</p>
    <p>While the ingredient­s have changed from kosher to a car­ni­vore’s de­light with of­fal, sausages and lots of pork and beans, the eat­ing rit­ual of co­cido</p>
    <p>madrileno re­mains the same.</p>
    <p>The cor­rect way of eat­ing co­cido is known as tres vuel­cos (three cour­ses), which in­cludes hav­ing broth with noo­dles, fol­lowed by eat­ing the legumes and veg­eta­bles be­fore you start on the meat.</p>
    <p>I fol­lowed this time-hon­oured tra­di­tion in one of the best restau­rants for co­cido madrileno in Madrid, the Taberna La Bola (Calle de la Bola, 5, 28013 Madrid), where the Ver­dasco family has been cook­ing it since 1870.</p>
