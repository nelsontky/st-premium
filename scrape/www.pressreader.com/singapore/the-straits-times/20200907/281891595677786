    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • The wife of Se­lan­gor’s Chief Min­is­ter has apol­o­gised af­ter her In­sta­gram post was slammed for be­ing in­sen­si­tive to mil­lions of peo­ple af­fected by wa­ter cuts in the Malaysian state.</p>
    <p>Screen­shots of the post by Datin Seri Mas­di­ana Muhamad, The Rakyat Post said yes­ter­day, showed a pic­ture of a wa­ter tanker parked in front of the fam­ily home with a hose run­ning up the drive­way. An­other pic­ture, cap­tioned “When there’s no wa­ter”, showed her fam­ily swim­ming in their pool at home.</p>
    <p>Mil­lions of res­i­dents and busi­nesses in parts of Se­lan­gor and the cap­i­tal Kuala Lumpur have been with­out wa­ter since last Thurs­day as a re­sult of un­sched­uled wa­ter sup­ply cuts. Four wa­ter treat­ment plants had to be shut down af­ter pol­lu­tion was de­tected in Sun­gai Gong.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted by The Rakyat Post, Madam Mas­di­ana, whose hus­band Amirudin Shari heads the state gov­ern­ment, apol­o­gised and promised to help other res­i­dents who have yet to have their wa­ter sup­ply re­stored.</p>
    <p>“As a mother, I just wanted to ex­press my grat­i­tude to the Air Se­lan­gor front-line staff who have been work­ing hard for the past few days.</p>
    <p>It was not my in­ten­tion to brag,” she told the news site.</p>
    <p>“I apol­o­gise if such ac­tions have cre­ated any mis­in­ter­pre­ta­tions and of­fended any­body.”</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials from wa­ter au­thor­ity Air Se­lan­gor have said the sup­ply dis­rup­tion was caused by pol­lu­tion from a fac­tory, and that it would take at least four days for wa­ter ser­vices to be fully re­stored.</p>
    <p>As of yes­ter­day morn­ing, sup­ply had been re­stored to nearly onethird of af­fected ar­eas, The Star re­ported.</p>
    <p>Se­lan­gor state and the fed­eral ter­ri­tory of Kuala Lumpur are the most densely pop­u­lated ar­eas in Malaysia, with about seven mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Pho­tos on so­cial me­dia showed thou­sands of peo­ple in many ar­eas queue­ing to fill up pails and bot­tles from wa­ter tankers. Mean­while, bot­tled drink­ing wa­ter has been fly­ing off su­per­mar­ket shelves.</p>
