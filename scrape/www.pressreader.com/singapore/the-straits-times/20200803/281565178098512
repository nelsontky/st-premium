    <p>Lawyers rep­re­sent­ing Alju­nied-Hougang Town Coun­cil are ap­ply­ing to add amend­ments to the claims against then town coun­cil­lor Pri­tam Singh and four oth­ers in a case which was de­cided by the High Court last year. The move is rare as judg­ment had al­ready been given, with eight de­fen­dants found li­able for var­i­ous breaches.</p>
    <p>Lawyers rep­re­sent­ing Alju­niedHougan­g Town Coun­cil (AHTC) are ap­ply­ing to add amend­ments to the claims against then town coun­cil­lor Pri­tam Singh and four oth­ers in a case which was de­cided by the High Court last year.</p>
    <p>The move is rare as Jus­tice Kan­nan Ramesh had al­ready given judg­ment in the case last year, hav­ing found eight de­fen­dants li­able for var­i­ous breaches, in­clud­ing for­mer Work­ers’ Party (WP) chief Low Thia Khi­ang and chair­man Sylvia Lim. A five-judge Court of Ap­peal is due to hear their ap­peals later this month.</p>
    <p>Lawyers point out that un­der the rules of court, a plain­tiff may ask the court for per­mis­sion to amend the state­ment of claim at any stage. This can be done even af­ter a lower court has ren­dered judg­ment and be­fore an ap­peal is heard.</p>
    <p>Lawyer Peter Do­raisamy said the move to amend the state­ment of claim is rare af­ter judg­ment has been given, un­like ap­pli­ca­tions to amend be­fore the case is heard or in the course of the trial, which in it­self is un­com­mon. “How­ever, the court has dis­cre­tion and will con­sider var­i­ous fac­tors in­clud­ing any prej­u­dice suf­fered by the de­fen­dant as a re­sult of the amend­ments.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court pa­pers filed by AHTC’s lawyers Shook Lin & Bok, the amend­ments seek to add to the claims against Mr Singh, Mr David Chua Zhi Hon and Mr Ken­neth Foo, town coun­cil­lors dur­ing the pe­riod un­der ques­tion in the case, and the own­ers of man­ag­ing agent com­pany FM So­lu­tions & Ser­vices and its sis­ter com­pany FM So­lu­tions and In­te­grated Ser­vices, Ms How Weng Fan and as per­sonal rep­re­sen­ta­tive of the es­tate of her late hus­band Danny Loh.</p>
    <p>Ini­tially, many of AHTC’s claims against them were premised on the ba­sis that they owed fidu­ciary du­ties to AHTC. Now, AHTC is also seek­ing to claim against Mr Singh, who is WP chief, and the four oth­ers in the case for al­leged breaches of a duty to ex­er­cise due skill and care.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court pa­pers, the grounds for the ap­pli­ca­tion are con­tained in the af­fi­davit of Se­nior Coun­sel Philip Je­yaret­nam, who chaired the independen­t panel ap­pointed and au­tho­rised by AHTC to ini­ti­ate le­gal ac­tion.</p>
    <p>In his judg­ment grounds last year, Jus­tice Ramesh held that Mr Singh did not breach fidu­ciary du­ties to AHTC, but was found to have breached his duty of skill and care.</p>
    <p>The amended state­ment for which court ap­proval is sought says, among oth­ers: “AHTC avers that Mr Pri­tam Singh, Mr Chua Zhi Hon and Mr Ken­neth Foo breached their duty of care and skill qua fidu­ciary and/or duty of care and skill in tort to AHTC.” It is un­der­stood that the pro­posed amend­ments are meant to re­flect the find­ings of the judge.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh did not re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment by press time.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor of Law Ben­jamin Ong said the move to amend the claim could be meant to es­tab­lish a se­cond ground of li­a­bil­ity be­fore the ap­peal is heard.</p>
    <p>“Much of the High Court’s judg­ment ap­pears to have been premised on its find­ing that Sylvia Lim, Low Thia Khi­ang, Pri­tam Singh, David Chua, Ken­neth Foo, How Weng Fan, and Danny Loh owed fidu­ciary du­ties to AHTC,” he said. “Fidu­ciary du­ties are strict du­ties of loy­alty. For ex­am­ple, if A owes fidu­ciary du­ties to B, A must not make use of his re­la­tion­ship with B to make prof­its or gain ben­e­fits for him­self; and A must strictly not let his own in­ter­ests come into con­flict with B’s in­ter­ests. The High Court went on to rule that A, by virtue of be­ing a fidu­ciary, would also owe a duty to take a cer­tain level of skill and care in his deal­ings with B.”</p>
    <p>The amend­ment could be meant for AHTC to max­imise its chances of suc­cess, Prof Ong sug­gested.</p>
    <p>“Un­der the amend­ments, AHTC will seek to ar­gue that it is still en­ti­tled to re­cover dam­ages for their al­leged breaches of a duty to ex­er­cise skill and care. This is be­cause, as a mat­ter of law, it is pos­si­ble for A to have a duty to ex­er­cise skill and care vis-a-vis B (as part of the law of neg­li­gence) even if A does not owe fidu­ciary du­ties to B,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We see this in var­i­ous fa­mil­iar ar­eas of life: For ex­am­ple, a driver owes a duty to take care not to harm other road users even though the driver does not owe them fidu­ciary du­ties.</p>
    <p>“That said, de­pend­ing on the pre­cise facts, the level of skill and care re­quired of a fidu­ciary might be dif­fer­ent from that re­quired of a per­son who does not owe fidu­ciary du­ties.”</p>
    <p>The hear­ing on the ap­pli­ca­tion is sched­uled to be held in cham­bers be­fore Jus­tice Ramesh to­day.</p>
    <p>RE­COV­ERY OF DAM­AGES</p>
    <p>Un­der the amend­ments, AHTC will seek to ar­gue that it is still en­ti­tled to re­cover dam­ages for their al­leged breaches of a duty ’’ to ex­er­cise skill and care. AS­SIS­TANT PRO­FES­SOR OF LAW BEN­JAMIN ONG, sug­gest­ing that the amend­ment could be meant for AHTC to max­imise its chances of suc­cess be­fore the Court of Ap­peal.</p>
