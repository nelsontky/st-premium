    <p>BAGH­DAD • Mr Youssef Ab­delka­rim’s store­front on one of Bagh­dad’s most his­toric streets is a time cap­sule – lit­er­ally. Thou­sands of wrist­watches fill the tiny shop, where three gen­er­a­tions have re­paired Iraq’s old­est time­pieces.</p>
    <p>The dusty dis­play win­dow in Rasheed Street fea­tures a sin­gle row of clas­sic watches in felt boxes at the front, with a mountain of hap­haz­ardly piled pieces be­hind it and oth­ers hang­ing from hooks over­head. In­side, there are watches in plas­tic buck­ets on the floor, packed in card­board boxes and stuffed into suit­cases.</p>
    <p>Mr Ab­delka­rim, 52, hunched over an an­tique piece, said: “Every watch has its own per­son­al­ity. I try to pre­serve it as much as I can, as if it were my own child.”</p>
    <p>He be­gan fix­ing watches at the age of 11, af­ter the death of his pa­ter­nal grand­fa­ther, who opened the store in the 1940s.</p>
    <p>He has re­paired ex­pen­sive Swiss models, in­clud­ing €10,000 Patek Philippes and what he calls “the poor man’s watch” – a Sigma.</p>
    <p>And he sus­pects he even fixed a piece that be­longed to Iraq’s feared dic­ta­tor Sad­dam Hus­sein. “It was a rare watch brought to me by the pres­i­den­tial palace, with Sad­dam’s sig­na­ture on the back,” he re­called.</p>
    <p>It cost 400 Iraqi di­nars to re­pair – more than US$1,000 in the 1980s – but less than a dol­lar to­day.</p>
    <p>In­deed, much has changed since then. Peo­ple swapped their ana­logue wrist­watches for dig­i­tal models, then dropped them al­to­gether for smart­phones.</p>
    <p>But Mr Ab­delka­rim in­sists an orig­i­nal time­piece is not a thing of the past, adding with a wink: “A man’s el­e­gance be­gins with his watch. And his shoes.”</p>
    <p>That may be right. His shop is still packed with cus­tomers of all ages and styles, in­clud­ing for­mer min­is­ters in sleek suits, col­lec­tors look­ing for vin­tage clas­sics and younger peo­ple bring­ing newer pieces for him to fix.</p>
    <p>With his eye­sight start­ing to fal­ter, he fixes just five pieces a day now, com­pared with the 1980s when he sold and fixed hun­dreds every day.</p>
    <p>At the time, Rasheed Street was bustling with busi­ness dur­ing the day and the top place to be seen at night. He re­mem­bers the the­atres, movie halls and cof­fee shops. “They never closed,” he said.</p>
    <p>His shop was com­pet­ing with dozens of other re­pair stores then but they started to shut­ter in the 1990s, when crip­pling in­ter­na­tional sanc­tions left many house­holds strug­gling to feed them­selves.</p>
    <p>The United States-led in­va­sion of 2003 top­pled then pres­i­dent Sad­dam and opened a Pan­dora’s box of sec­tar­ian vi­o­lence, in­clud­ing car bombs in Rasheed Street.</p>
    <p>Mr Ab­delka­rim moved to a safer neigh­bour­hood but still walked to the fam­ily store to keep it open.</p>
    <p>Even last year, when Rasheed Street was shut for months by a huge protest camp in nearby Tahrir Square, he man­aged to keep work­ing. “I’d open once or twice a week be­cause the riot po­lice of­ten clashed with pro­test­ers here, but I still came,” he said.</p>
    <p>All around him, the vin­tage cloth­ing stores or book­shops have closed, trans­formed into ware­houses or stores sell­ing car ac­ces­sories. “The street’s fea­tures were erased and most of my friends moved. But there’s just some­thing dif­fer­ent that sets it apart from every other place in Bagh­dad,” he said.</p>
    <p>He is teach­ing his sons, Ye­hya, 24, and Mustafa, 16, to take over the busi­ness. But he in­sists they will pre­serve the store as it is, with its cracked walls fram­ing the door, its dusty shelves and its moun­tains of time­pieces.</p>
    <p>“This shop hasn’t changed in 50 years, which is what keeps peo­ple com­ing back,” he said. “That’s what pre­serves its iden­tity.”</p>
