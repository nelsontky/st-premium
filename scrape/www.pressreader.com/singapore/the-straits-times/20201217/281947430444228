    <p>BER­LIN • Ev­ery time Elon Musk flies in from his base in Cal­i­for­nia to Ger­many to in­spect his new fac­tory be­ing built at Grun­heide, 35km south-east of the cap­i­tal of Ber­lin, the sleepy town jumps awake.</p>
    <p>The chief ex­ec­u­tive of elec­tric car man­u­fac­turer Tesla usu­ally comes at short no­tice. His pri­vate jet touches down at a nearby air­port, and he is chauf­feured to the con­struc­tion site in no time.</p>
    <p>Ut­ter­ing a few sen­tences into the mics of the ur­gently gath­ered crowd of re­porters and Tesla watch­ers, he then walks speed­ily across the rapidly grow­ing premises of Tesla Gi­gafac­tory Ber­lin-Bran­den­burg, to give the ven­ture its full name.</p>
    <p>The plant will be the fourth Tesla Gi­gafac­tory and the first in Europe. Work be­gan sev­eral months ago on the fac­tory, which will pro­duce bat­ter­ies and bat­tery packs for Tesla ve­hi­cles, and also as­sem­ble the forth­com­ing Tesla Model Y. The first ve­hi­cles are sup­posed to roll off the pro­duc­tion lines next July.</p>
    <p>Speed is the sig­na­ture at­tribute associated with Mr Musk. In his uni­verse, ev­ery­thing has to go fast. If not, one’s job is on the line.</p>
    <p>Take Mr Evan Horet­sky, who was, un­til Oc­to­ber, con­struc­tion man­ager at the Grun­heide fac­tory. When things slowed down, in part be­cause of the longer-than-ex­pected Ger­man ap­proval process, Mr Musk fired him even though Mr Horet­sky was a sea­soned project man­ager, hav­ing su­per­vised fac­to­ries in Ne­vada, Shang­hai and Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>The Tesla chief, no­to­ri­ous for his im­pa­tience and “rage fir­ings”, takes no pris­on­ers if his ex­pec­ta­tions are not met.</p>
    <p>Mr Musk has been dubbed a dis­rup­tor for his gung-ho thrust in elec­tric car tech­nol­ogy, but for Grun­heide, it is Mr Musk who is the great dis­rup­tor.</p>
    <p>How­ever, for the state of Bran­den­burg, which sur­rounds Ber­lin and in which Grun­heide is lo­cated, he could be a saviour. Since uni­fi­ca­tion 30 years ago, the re­gion has been des­per­ately look­ing for new in­vest­ment, new tech­nolo­gies and, most of all, new jobs.</p>
    <p>A main­stay of Bran­den­burg’s economy was lig­nite min­ing, but that is be­ing phased out. Mr Musk’s gi­gafac­tory prom­ises to be the spark reignit­ing the state’s for­tunes.</p>
    <p>For Grun­heide, though, it is a dif­fer­ent story. The lit­tle town of fewer than 8,000 peo­ple is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a tsunami of changes. With ini­tially 10,000 – and even­tu­ally up to 40,000 – new jobs cre­ated through the plant, life in Grun­heide will be turned up­side down.</p>
    <p>Its old train sta­tion has un­der­gone a rad­i­cal facelift, forests have been cleared, dwellings are be­ing or will be built, and work­ers from many places will flow into the area.</p>
    <p>The cosy but dull life that many pen­sion­ers have en­joyed in Grun­heide may soon be over. In­deed, ac­tion groups have sprung up try­ing to block the project, but to lit­tle avail. Why? Be­cause re­gional and na­tional politi­cians want Tesla to suc­ceed.</p>
    <p>Mr Musk brings dis­rup­tion not only to Grun­heide – which is ge­o­graph­i­cally favourable for him, be­ing si­t­u­ated next to mo­tor­ways, an air­port, the Ger­man cap­i­tal and in close prox­im­ity to Poland, with its reser­voir of cheap labour. The 49-year-old en­trepreneur, who’s orig­i­nally from South Africa, is also giv­ing the Ger­man car in­dus­try a fright.</p>
    <p>At around US$600 bil­lion (S$800 bil­lion), Nas­daq-listed Tesla’s mar­ket value is three times that of Ger­many’s Daim­ler, BMW and Volk­swa­gen to­gether.</p>
    <p>CHAL­LENGE TO LO­CAL MARQUES</p>
    <p>Iron­i­cally, while Tesla is cre­at­ing scores of jobs, Daim­ler plans to sig­nif­i­cantly trim the work­force at one of its plants only 50km west of Grun­heide. In to­tal, Daim­ler –</p>
    <p>Ger­many’s old­est car man­u­fac­turer – might slash 30,000 jobs over the up­com­ing months due to the pan­demic slow­ing de­mand sig­nif­i­cantly.</p>
    <p>Al­though third-quar­ter re­sults were a lit­tle bet­ter, in the sec­ond quar­ter of this year, the Stuttgart-based com­pany suf­fered a huge loss of €1.9 bil­lion</p>
    <p>(S$3.1 bil­lion) on group sales of 541,800 ve­hi­cles. Tesla, at the same time, earned a profit of US$104 mil­lion for the sec­ond quar­ter – sell­ing only 90,650 cars.</p>
    <p>Be­yond the sheer num­bers, an­other fac­tor is giv­ing the Ger­man marques cause for con­cern.</p>
    <p>In com­par­i­son with a com­pany like Tesla, Daim­ler’s car con­cept looks dated in terms of adopt­ing new tech­nolo­gies. Un­de­cided which way to go, Ger­man car man­u­fac­tur­ers for too long have clung to the old tech­nol­ogy of the com­bus­tion en­gine.</p>
    <p>True, one can ques­tion the wis­dom of bet­ting ev­ery­thing on elec­tric ve­hi­cles, since they have only a neu­tral car­bon foot­print – and that, only if bat­ter­ies are charged us­ing green en­ergy. But like it or not, gov­ern­ment poli­cies have all pointed in the di­rec­tion of e-mo­bil­ity even if Ger­man car en­gi­neers have re­mained hes­i­tant.</p>
    <p>Tesla early on re­alised that times were chang­ing, that the cli­mate cri­sis and tight­en­ing of emis­sion rules would make life hard for tra­di­tional car­mak­ers. By pro­duc­ing a bat­tery-based elec­tric car, the com­pany from Palo Alto of­fered a wel­come way out.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Tesla’s start was so rocky that it was Daim­ler that came to the res­cue. In 2009, it bought just un­der 10 per cent of Tesla, prac­ti­cally sav­ing Mr Musk’s bold ven­ture from go­ing bank­rupt.</p>
    <p>But in a crass mis­judg­ment five years later, Daim­ler sold its Tesla shares for €780 mil­lion. If Daim­ler had kept the stock, today it would be worth a high dou­ble-digit bil­lion amount.</p>
    <p>“Tesla is eat­ing Daim­ler”, read the head­line of a me­dia col­umn writ­ten ear­lier this year by the long-time chief econ­o­mist of BMW, Mr Hel­mut Becker. He pre­dicted a “twi­light of the gods” for Ger­man car­mak­ers. For him, Mr Musk is “an elec­tron­ics ge­nius with the traits of a mod­ern Jules Verne”.</p>
    <p>IN­NO­VA­TIVE EDGE</p>
    <p>Al­though one should not be en­tirely daz­zled by the glitz Mr Musk brings to Ger­many, he un­doubt­edly works as a much-needed wake-up call for the economy.</p>
    <p>With an age­ing pop­u­la­tion that en­joys the bless­ings of a welfare state, the coun­try has to keep up its in­no­va­tive edge to main­tain cur­rent stan­dards.</p>
    <p>Ger­many is a high-wage and high-tax coun­try, but the sys­tem works only as long as prod­ucts are top-notch and cus­tomers are will­ing to pay a pre­mium.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a study com­mis­sioned by the Ber­tels­mann Foun­da­tion and pub­lished in Oc­to­ber con­cluded that Ger­man in­dus­try must be care­ful to not fall be­hind in in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the study, only a quar­ter of the 1,000 sur­veyed com­pa­nies have the in­no­va­tion com­pe­tence and cul­ture needed to se­cure their po­si­tion in glob­alised mar­kets. Half of the man­agers ad­mit­ted that they are lag­ging in the ar­eas of ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, big data and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>This co­in­cides with a re­cent as­sess­ment by the Euro­pean Patent Of­fice (EPO). Of the al­most 40,000 in­ter­na­tional patent fam­i­lies filed in 2018 for so-called Fourth In­dus­trial Revo­lu­tion tech­nol­ogy, 2,051 came from Ger­many.</p>
    <p>While this still looks good for Europe, glob­ally, Ger­many is well be­hind the United States, Ja­pan, China and South Korea. “With an av­er­age growth of 14.9 per cent per year, Ger­many’s po­si­tion is weak­en­ing,” the EPO states drily.</p>
    <p>The ever-in­creas­ing role of the state and over-reg­u­la­tion are not help­ing in­no­va­tion. “We must not screw up Tesla in Grun­heide” is what is be­ing mut­tered in some cir­cles of in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>Mr Musk’s gi­gafac­tory, there­fore, is much more than just an­other ma­jor in­vest­ment. As some are say­ing: “It is the lit­mus test of whether Ger­many is still one of the best places for in­no­va­tion.”</p>
