    <p>Business and le­gal is­sues dog­ging cor­po­rate leader Goh Jin Hian are mount­ing, the lat­est be­ing a law­suit brought by the ju­di­cial man­agers of a marine fu­els sup­plier over US$156 mil­lion (S$212.6 mil­lion) in losses re­sult­ing from his al­leged breach of di­rec­tor’s du­ties.</p>
    <p>The ju­di­cial man­agers of in­sol­vent In­ter-Pa­cific Petroleum (IPP) have sued Dr Goh, the com­pany’s for­mer di­rec­tor, in a suit filed late last Fri­day night in Sin­ga­pore’s High Court by LVM Law Cham­bers, which rep­re­sents Deloitte & Touche, IPP’s ju­di­cial man­agers.</p>
    <p>Last week, main­board-listed health­care provider New Silkroutes Group dis­closed that Dr Goh, its ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor and then chief ex­ec­u­tive, and fi­nance di­rec­tor Wil­liam Teo were as­sist­ing the Com­mer­cial Af­fairs De­part­ment (CAD) with in­ves­ti­ga­tions. Both men’s pass­ports have been re­tained by CAD. How­ever, nei­ther has been ar­rested nor charged.</p>
    <p>The firm was re­spond­ing to Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX) queries re­gard­ing the CAD probe into a pos­si­ble of­fence un­der the Securities and Fu­tures Act. New Silkroutes said it un­der­stands that the al­leged of­fence is false trad­ing and mar­ket rig­ging in view of past share buy­backs and stock acquisitio­ns.</p>
    <p>The firm’s board main­tains that the two men are suit­able to con­tinue in their roles as no charges have been made against them.</p>
    <p>Dr Goh stepped down as New Silkroutes CEO last Thurs­day and has taken on the role of non-ex­ec­u­tive chair­man. The firm has ap­pointed Dr VicPearly Wong as CEO.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, main­board-listed Cordlife Group’s board has backed Dr Goh, its chair­man and in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tor. The board – with Dr Goh ab­stain­ing – said last Fri­day that his as­sist­ing CAD with its New Silkroutes probe “does not com­pro­mise his abil­ity to ful­fil his duty as chair­man and in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tor (of Cordlife), and the board is sup­port­ive of his con­tin­ued ser­vice”.</p>
    <p>That prompted an SGX query yes­ter­day on how Cordlife’s board as­sessed the suitabilit­y of Dr Goh re­main­ing as chair and in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tor. The reg­u­la­tor noted that listing rules re­quire a firm to con­sider the char­ac­ter and in­tegrity of di­rec­tors and man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>The Cordlife board noted Dr Goh “has al­ways dis­played a high level of pro­fes­sion­al­ism, in­tegrity and strong lead­er­ship in his con­duct dur­ing board dis­cus­sions and meet­ings” and that the firm “has ben­e­fited from his strong guid­ance and lead­er­ship in his years of ser­vice”.</p>
    <p>It added that it “had formed the view that there is noth­ing at this junc­ture to in­di­cate that Dr Goh’s abil­ity to over­see and man­age the af­fairs of the com­pany” would be com­pro­mised as a re­sult of the on­go­ing CAD probe. “It would be in the best in­ter­ests of the com­pany for him to presently con­tinue with his roles and re­spon­si­bil­i­ties,” it said.</p>
