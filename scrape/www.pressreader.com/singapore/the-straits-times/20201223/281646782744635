    <p>NEW YORK • The new vari­ant is now the fo­cus of in­tense de­bate and anal­y­sis. Here is some of what sci­en­tists have learnt so far.</p>
    <p>Q Is the Bri­tish vari­ant some kind of new su­per virus?</p>
    <p>A No. It is just one vari­a­tion among many that have arisen as the SarsCoV-2 spreads around the world. Mu­ta­tions arise as the virus repli­cates, and this vari­ant – known as B.1.1.7 – has ac­quired its own dis­tinc­tive set of them.</p>
    <p>Q What is un­usual about it?</p>
    <p>A The vari­ant came to the at­ten­tion of re­searchers this month, when it be­gan to turn up more fre­quently in sam­ples from parts of south­ern Eng­land. It turned out to have been col­lected from pa­tients as early as Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>When re­searchers took a close look at its genome, they were struck by the rel­a­tively large num­ber of mu­ta­tions – 23, all told – that it had ac­quired. Most mu­ta­tions that arise in the coro­n­avirus are ei­ther harm­ful to the virus or have no ef­fect one way or an­other.</p>
    <p>But a num­ber of mu­ta­tions in B.1.1.7 looked as if they could po­ten­tially af­fect how the virus spreads.</p>
    <p>Q Is it more con­ta­gious than other viruses?</p>
    <p>A It ap­pears so. In pre­lim­i­nary work, re­searchers in Bri­tain have found that the virus is spread­ing quickly in parts of south­ern Eng­land, dis­plac­ing a crowded field of other vari­ants that have been cir­cu­lat­ing for months.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a virus lineage be­com­ing more com­mon is not proof that it spreads faster than oth­ers.</p>
    <p>It could grow more wide­spread sim­ply through luck. For in­stance, a vari­ant might start out in the mid­dle of a crowded city, where trans­mis­sion is easy, al­low­ing it to make more copies of it­self.</p>
    <p>Still, the epi­demi­o­log­i­cal ev­i­dence gath­ered so far from south­ern Eng­land does seem to sug­gest that this vari­ant is very good at spread­ing.</p>
    <p>Im­pe­rial Col­lege Lon­don pub­lic health re­searcher Neil Fer­gu­son es­ti­mates that the vari­ant has an in­creased trans­mis­sion rate of 50 per cent to 70 per cent com­pared with other vari­ants in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Some sci­en­tists have raised the pos­si­bil­ity that the in­crease in trans­mis­sion is at least partly the re­sult of how it in­fects chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Nor­mally, chil­dren are less likely than teenagers or adults to get in­fected or pass on the virus.</p>
    <p>But the new strain may make chil­dren “as equally sus­cep­ti­ble as adults”, said Pro­fes­sor Wendy Bar­clay, gov­ern­ment ad­viser and vi­rol­o­gist at Im­pe­rial Col­lege Lon­don.</p>
    <p>To con­firm that the vari­ant truly is more con­ta­gious, re­searchers are now run­ning lab­o­ra­tory ex­per­i­ments on it, ob­serv­ing up close how it in­fects cells.</p>
    <p>Q Does it cause more se­vere dis­ease?</p>
    <p>A There is no strong ev­i­dence that it does, at least not yet. But there is rea­son to take the pos­si­bil­ity se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>In South Africa, an­other lineage of the coro­n­avirus has gained one par­tic­u­lar mu­ta­tion that is also found in B.1.1.7. This vari­ant is spread­ing quickly through coastal ar­eas of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>And in pre­lim­i­nary stud­ies, doc­tors there have found that peo­ple in­fected with this vari­ant carry a height­ened vi­ral load – a higher con­cen­tra­tion of the virus in their up­per res­pi­ra­tory tract.</p>
    <p>In many vi­ral diseases, this is as­so­ci­ated with more se­vere symp­toms.</p>
    <p>Q Where did this un­usual vari­ant come from?</p>
    <p>A That is now a ques­tion of in­tense de­bate. One pos­si­bil­ity is that the vari­ant gained its ar­ray of new mu­ta­tions in­side a spe­cial set of hosts.</p>
    <p>In a typ­i­cal in­fec­tion, peo­ple pick up the coro­n­avirus and be­come in­fec­tious for a few days be­fore show­ing symp­toms.</p>
    <p>The virus then be­comes less abun­dant in the body as the im­mune sys­tem mar­shals a de­fence.</p>
    <p>Un­less pa­tients suf­fer a se­ri­ous case of Covid-19, they typ­i­cally clear the virus com­pletely in a few weeks at most.</p>
    <p>But some­times the virus in­fects peo­ple with weak im­mune sys­tems. In their bod­ies, the virus can thrive for months. Case stud­ies on these im­muno-com­pro­mised peo­ple have shown that the virus can ac­cu­mu­late a large num­ber of mu­ta­tions as it repli­cates in their bod­ies for a long pe­riod of time.</p>
    <p>Over time, re­searchers have found, nat­u­ral se­lec­tion can favour mu­tant viruses that can evade the im­mune sys­tem. Re­searchers have also sug­gested that the evo­lu­tion of the vari­ant might have been ad­di­tion­ally driven by medicine given to such pa­tients. Some mu­tants might be able to with­stand drugs such as mon­o­clonal an­ti­bod­ies.</p>
    <p>Other sci­en­tists have sug­gested that the virus could have gained new mu­ta­tions by spread­ing through an an­i­mal pop­u­la­tion, like minks, be­fore re-en­ter­ing the hu­man pop­u­la­tion. Such “an­i­mal reser­voirs” have be­come a fo­cus of in­tense in­ter­est as more an­i­mal in­fec­tions have been de­tected.</p>
    <p>Q Will the vari­ant ren­der the new vac­cines in­ef­fec­tive?</p>
    <p>A No. Most ex­perts doubt that it will have any great ef­fect on vac­cines, although it is not yet pos­si­ble to rule out any ef­fect.</p>
    <p>The United States Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion has au­tho­rised two vac­cines, one from Moderna and the other from Pfizer and BioNTech. Both vac­cines cre­ate im­mu­nity to the coro­n­avirus by teach­ing our im­mune sys­tems to make an­ti­bod­ies to a pro­tein that sits on the sur­face of the virus, called spike.</p>
    <p>The spike pro­tein latches onto cells and opens a pas­sage­way in­side. An­ti­bod­ies pro­duced in re­sponse to the vac­cines stick to the tip of the spike. The re­sult: The viruses can­not get in­side.</p>
    <p>It is con­ceiv­able that a mu­ta­tion to a coro­n­avirus could change the shape of its spike pro­teins, mak­ing it harder for the an­ti­bod­ies to gain a tight grip on them. And B.1.1.7’s mu­ta­tions in­clude eight in the spike gene. But our im­mune sys­tems can pro­duce a range of an­ti­bod­ies against a sin­gle vi­ral pro­tein, mak­ing it less likely that viruses can eas­ily es­cape their at­tack.</p>
    <p>Right now, ex­perts do not think that the vari­ant will be able to evade vac­cines. To con­firm that, re­searchers at the Wal­ter Reed Army In­sti­tute of Re­search are analysing the changes to the struc­ture of its spike pro­tein.</p>
