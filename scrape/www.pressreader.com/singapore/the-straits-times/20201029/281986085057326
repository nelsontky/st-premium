    <p>A strong sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy core will be even more crit­i­cal to Sin­ga­pore and its armed forces as the coun­try nav­i­gates an in­creas­ingly com­plex world with fast-evolv­ing threats, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy such as au­to­ma­tion, robotics and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence will change not only the way peo­ple live and work, but also how the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces (SAF) fights and op­er­ates, he said at a cer­e­mony to com­mem­o­rate the 20th an­niver­sary of the De­fence Sci­ence and</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy Agency (DSTA).</p>
    <p>“The next 20 years will likely be even more ex­cit­ing than the last. We are in the midst of the Fourth In­dus­trial Revolution, and the pace of change has quick­ened since Covid-19,” he told se­nior de­fence of­fi­cials at the event at the DSTA In­te­grated Com­plex in De­pot Road, as well as more than 3,000 DSTA staff and guests who tuned in vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies and Min­is­ter for Fi­nance, also launched a com­mem­o­ra­tive book ti­tled Or­di­nary Peo­ple Ex­tra­or­di­nary Pas­sion.</p>
    <p>It chron­i­cles DSTA’s trans­for­ma­tion, in­no­va­tions and con­tri­bu­tions in the last two decades.</p>
    <p>These in­clude build­ing the highly net­worked Is­land Air De­fence Sys­tem, the army’s Hunter Ar­moured</p>
    <p>Fight­ing Ve­hi­cle, and the navy’s lit­toral mis­sion ves­sels that are cus­tomised to Sin­ga­pore’s needs.</p>
    <p>Es­tab­lished in 2000, DSTA is a statu­tory board un­der the De­fence Min­istry that makes use of sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy. It pro­vides tech­no­log­i­cal and en­gi­neer­ing sup­port for Sin­ga­pore’s de­fence and se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>In his speech, Mr Heng said DSTA has grown by leaps and bounds since its birth. “You have built a range of deep ex­per­tise – from our air, naval and land sys­tems, to C3 (com­mand, con­trol and com­mu­ni­ca­tions) and cy­ber se­cu­rity.”</p>
    <p>Lo­cally de­signed plat­forms such as the Hunter and the lit­toral mis­sion ves­sels are tes­ta­ment to DSTA’s abil­ity to trans­late tech­nol­ogy and plans into re­al­ity, he added. “These ca­pa­bil­i­ties have kept our fight­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties ahead of the curve.”</p>
    <p>Mr Heng re­counted that sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy have been in­stru­men­tal in build­ing Sin­ga­pore’s de­fence ca­pa­bil­i­ties. When the Bri­tish forces with­drew from Sin­ga­pore in the 1970s, the coun­try had only two in­fantry reg­i­ments, two sea­wor­thy wooden ships and two bor­rowed Cessna air­craft, he said.</p>
    <p>“Through the in­ge­nu­ity and ded­i­ca­tion of our de­fence com­mu­nity, the SAF has grown from these hum­ble be­gin­nings into an ad­vanced and ca­pa­ble fight­ing force.”</p>
    <p>Mr Heng lauded DSTA’s con­tri­bu­tions, in­clud­ing to­wards na­tional ef­forts to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>It helped to de­velop tem­per­a­ture self-check sys­tems and mo­bile swab­bing sta­tions, and tapped its net­works to pro­cure emer­gency healthcare sup­plies amid global sup­ply chain un­cer­tain­ties, he said.</p>
    <p>“Time and again, the men and women of DSTA have gone be­yond the call of duty in times of cri­sis,” he added, not­ing that it de­vel­oped ther­mal scan­ners dur­ing the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome out­break in 2003.</p>
    <p>He said what made the agency ex­tra­or­di­nary was not just its range of deep ex­per­tise, but also its ex­ten­sive network of part­ner­ships.</p>
    <p>It has strength­ened such part­ner­ships through host­ing events such as the Sin­ga­pore De­fence Tech­nol­ogy Sum­mit, for in­stance, and through col­lab­o­ra­tions with global com­pa­nies such as Rolls-Royce, Air­bus, Boe­ing, Sam­sung and IBM.</p>
    <p>“These col­lab­o­ra­tions keep DSTA at the fore­front of tech­nol­ogy. The pres­ence of so many of you here on­line is a tes­ta­ment of the strength of that re­la­tion­ship,” said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>DSTA chief ex­ec­u­tive Tan Peng Yam said that to achieve its mis­sion, the agency has adopted the strat­egy of in­vest­ing in and har­ness­ing its peo­ple to their fullest po­ten­tial.</p>
    <p>“We place great em­pha­sis on our shared pur­pose as well as creat­ing mean­ing­ful work and a vi­brant en­vi­ron­ment for ev­ery­one to col­lab­o­rate, in­no­vate and grow.”</p>
