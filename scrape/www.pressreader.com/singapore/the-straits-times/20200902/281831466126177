    <p>TAIPEI • The head of the Czech Se­nate de­clared him­self to be Tai­wanese in a speech at Tai­wan’s Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day, chan­nelling the late US pres­i­dent John F. Kennedy’s de­fi­ance of com­mu­nism in Ber­lin in 1963, and fur­ther ril­ing Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>China, which claims demo­cratic Tai­wan as its own ter­ri­tory, has threat­ened to make Czech Se­nate Speaker Mi­los Vys­tr­cil pay a “heavy price” for vis­it­ing the is­land. The Czech Repub­lic, like most coun­tries, has no for­mal diplo­matic ties with Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing Tai­wan’s Par­lia­ment, Mr Vys­tr­cil, who is lead­ing a del­e­ga­tion of about 90 politi­cians and busi­ness ex­ec­u­tives, said Kennedy’s dec­la­ra­tion that he was a Ber­liner was an im­por­tant mes­sage for free­dom and against com­mu­nism.</p>
    <p>“Please let me also ex­press in per­son my sup­port to Tai­wan and the ul­ti­mate value of free­dom and con­clude to­day’s speech... with per­haps a more hum­ble, but equally strong state­ment, ‘I am a Tai­wanese’,” Mr Vys­tr­cil said, re­ceiv­ing a stand­ing ova­tion.</p>
    <p>In Bei­jing, Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Hua Chun­y­ing said that Mr Vys­tr­cil was openly sup­port­ing sep­a­ratism and in­ter­fer­ing in China’s in­ter­nal af­fairs.</p>
    <p>“China strongly con­demns this,” Ms Hua told re­porters at a reg­u­lar brief­ing.</p>
    <p>Kennedy’s “Ich bin ein Ber­liner” speech in 1963, telling the fright­ened peo­ple of West Ber­lin who were sur­rounded on all sides by com­mu­nist East Ber­lin that he was also a Ber­liner, is an ad­dress of­ten called the US pres­i­dent’s best.</p>
    <p>Mr Vys­tr­cil has said his Tai­wan visit un­der­scores the “val­ues­based” for­eign pol­icy put in place by late pres­i­dent Va­clav Havel, an anti-com­mu­nist dis­si­dent and per­sonal friend of the ex­iled Ti­betan spir­i­tual leader, the Dalai Lama.</p>
    <p>While the Czech govern­ment has not sup­ported his visit, it has been up­set by China’s strong con­dem­na­tion of it, and has sum­moned the Chi­nese am­bas­sador. Bei­jing on Mon­day also sum­moned the Czech am­bas­sador for a telling-off.</p>
    <p>Czech Pres­i­dent Mi­los Ze­man has sought closer busi­ness and po­lit­i­cal ties with China since tak­ing of­fice in 2013, but his ef­forts have been hit by failed in­vest­ment plans as well as Prague’s wa­ver­ing about al­low­ing China’s Huawei Tech­nolo­gies to play a role in de­vel­op­ing the Czech Repub­lic’s next-gen­er­a­tion tele­coms net­works.</p>
