    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Hol­ly­wood ac­tor Sean Penn has re­port­edly mar­ried his Aus­tralian-Amer­i­can ac­tress girl­friend Leila Ge­orge, 28.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor, who turns 60 this month, is 32 years older than Ge­orge and is the same age as her mother, Ital­ian-Aus­tralian ac­tress Greta Scac­chi.</p>
    <p>News of the mar­riage broke af­ter a friend con­grat­u­lated them on In­sta­gram and up­loaded a photo of what seemed to be the cou­ple’s hands and their rings, En­ter­tain­ment Tonight re­ported last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Avengers ac­tor Josh Brolin con­grat­u­lated the cou­ple in the com­ments as well. The post has since been taken down.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple have been dat­ing for about four years.</p>
    <p>Ge­orge, who has been in films like 2018’s Mor­tal En­gines, is the daugh­ter of ac­tor and pro­ducer Vin­cent D’Onofrio and ac­tress Scac­chi.</p>
    <p>Penn has been mar­ried twice pre­vi­ously. His first mar­riage to pop su­per­star Madonna ended in 1989 af­ter four years. They have no chil­dren to­gether.</p>
    <p>His se­cond mar­riage was to House Of Cards (2013-2018) ac­tress Robin Wright, with whom he had an on-and-off re­la­tion­ship. They mar­ried in 1996 but di­vorced in 2010. They have a daugh­ter, ac­tress and model Dy­lan Frances, 29, and a son, Hop­per Jack, 27.</p>
    <p>Be­fore Ge­orge, Penn had dated ac­tress Char­l­ize Theron, but they broke up in 2015.</p>
