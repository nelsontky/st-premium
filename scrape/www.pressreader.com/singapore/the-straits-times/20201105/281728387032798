    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The United States for­mally ex­ited the Paris Agree­ment yes­ter­day, ful­fill­ing an old prom­ise by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump to with­draw t he world’s sec­ond-largest green­house gas emit­ter from the global pact to fight cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>But the out­come of the tight US pres­i­den­tial race will de­ter­mine for how long. Mr Trump’s Demo­cratic ri­val Joe Bi­den has promised to re­join the agree­ment if elected.</p>
    <p>“The US with­drawal will leave a gap in our regime, and the global ef­forts to achieve the goals and am­bi­tions of the Paris Agree­ment,” said Ms Pa­tri­cia Espinosa, ex­ec­u­tive sec­re­tary of the United Na­tions Frame­work Con­ven­tion on Cli­mate Change (UNFCCC).</p>
    <p>The US still re­mains a party to the UNFCCC.</p>
    <p>Ms Espinosa said the body will be “ready to as­sist the US in any ef­fort in or­der to re­join the Paris Agree­ment”.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump an­nounced his in­ten­tion to with­draw the US from the pact in June 2017, ar­gu­ing it would un­der­mine the US economy.</p>
    <p>His ad­min­is­tra­tion for­mally served no­tice of the with­drawal on Nov 4 last year, which took one year to take ef­fect.</p>
    <p>The de­par­ture makes the US the only coun­try of 197 sig­na­to­ries to have with­drawn from the agree­ment, hashed out in 2015.</p>
    <p>Cur­rent and for­mer cli­mate diplo­mats said the task of curb­ing global warm­ing to safe l evels would be tougher with­out the US’ fi­nan­cial and di­plo­matic might.</p>
    <p>“This will be a lost op­por­tu­nity for a col­lec­tive global fight against cli­mate change,” said Mr Tan­guy Ga­houma-Bekale, chair of the African Group of Ne­go­tia­tors in global cli­mate talks.</p>
    <p>A US exit would also cre­ate a “sig­nif­i­cant short­fall” in global cli­mate fi­nances, Mr Ga­houma-Bekale said, point­ing to an Obama-era pledge to con­trib­ute US$3 bil­lion (S$4.1 bil­lion) to a fund to help vul­ner­a­ble coun­tries tackle cli­mate change, of which only US$1 bil­lion was de­liv­ered.</p>
    <p>Mr Thom Woodroofe, a for­mer diplo­mat in UN cli­mate talks and now a se­nior ad­viser at the Asia So­ci­ety Pol­icy In­sti­tute, said: “The chal­lenge to close the global am­bi­tion gap be­comes much, much harder in the short term.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, other ma­jor emit­ters have dou­bled down on cli­mate ac­tion, even with­out guar­an­tees that the US will fol­low suit.</p>
    <p>China, Ja­pan and South Korea have all pledged in re­cent weeks to be­come car­bon neu­tral – a com­mit­ment al­ready made by the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>Those pledges will help drive the huge l ow-car­bon in­vest­ments needed to curb cli­mate change. If the US were to re-en­ter the Paris ac­cord, it would give those ef­forts “a mas­sive shot in the arm”, said Mr Woodroofe.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean and US i nvestors, with a col­lec­tive US$30 tril­lion in as­sets, yes­ter­day urged the US to quickly re­join the Paris deal and warned that the coun­try risked fall­ing be­hind in the global race to build a low-car­bon economy.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists say the world must cut emis­sions sharply this decade to avoid the most cat­a­strophic ef­fects of global warm­ing.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Paris deal, for­mer US pres­i­dent Barack Obama’s ad­min­is­tra­tion had pledged to cut US emis­sions by 26 per cent to 28 per cent by 2025, from 2005 lev­els.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, who was Mr Obama’s vice-pres­i­dent, is broadly ex­pected to ramp up those goals if elected. He has promised to achieve net-zero emis­sions by 2050, un­der a sweep­ing US$2 tril­lion plan to trans­form the economy.</p>
    <p>The Rhodium Group said that this year, the US will be around 21 per cent be­low 2005 lev­els. It added that un­der a sec­ond Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, it ex­pects US emis­sions would in­crease by more than 30 per cent through 2035 from last year’s lev­els.</p>
