    <p>MS JAYA ANIL KU­MAR, a case man­ager at Hu­man­i­tar­ian Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Mi­gra­tion Eco­nom­ics.</p>
    <p>Do­mes­tic worker Nalin (not her real name) does not get enough sleep ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>She has been car­ing for a 92-year-old with de­men­tia for two years, l ook­ing af­ter her through­out the night.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the day, she is un­able to rest as she wor­ries about leav­ing the el­derly woman un­su­per­vised.</p>
    <p>Ke­valy (not her real name), who is also a maid, has been tak­ing care of an 89-year-old wheelchair­bound stroke pa­tient with earlystage de­men­tia for nine months.</p>
    <p>When Ke­valy fell ill, her em­ployer pres­sured her to con­tinue work­ing and ac­com­pany her charge to se­nior day­care, even though Ke­valy had a med­i­cal cer­tifi­cate from a doc­tor.</p>
    <p>They were among 25 maids whose strug­gles with over­work and a lack of sup­port were told in a re­search re­port re­leased by the As­so­ci­a­tion of Women for Ac­tion and Re­search (Aware) and Hu­man­i­tar­ian Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Mi­gra­tion Eco­nom­ics (Home) yes­ter­day in an on­line press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Their ages ranged from 27 to 53, and they were mostly from the Philip­pines and Myan­mar.</p>
    <p>They had worked for about five years and four months on av­er­age in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers also in­ter­viewed four maid agen­cies, seven em­ploy­ers of maids in elder­care and five providers of for­mal elder­care train­ing be­tween last De­cem­ber and Septem­ber this year.</p>
    <p>Ti­tled Nei­ther Fam­ily Nor Em­ployee, the re­search con­sid­ered the care­giver bur­den faced by mi­grant do­mes­tic work­ers (MDWs) car­ing for the el­derly in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Ms Shai­ley Hin­go­rani, head of re­search and ad­vo­cacy at Aware, said: “As we rapidly age as a so­ci­ety, our re­liance on MDWs is likely to in­crease.</p>
    <p>“Un­less we pay spe­cific at­ten­tion to the con­se­quences of care­giv­ing on the men­tal and phys­i­cal health of MDWs, we run the risk of com­pro­mis­ing the qual­ity of care given to our elders – a lose-lose sce­nario.”</p>
    <p>Ms Jaya Anil Ku­mar, a case man­ager at Home, said: “A lot of do­mes­tic work­ers are afraid to voice their con­cerns and fears.”</p>
    <p>She added that many in­ter­viewed said they were over­worked and had their men­tal health im­pacted.</p>
    <p>When asked about the small sam­ple size, Ms Hin­go­rani said that it was a qual­i­ta­tive study and in-depth in­ter­views had to be con­ducted.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers also spoke to stake­hold­ers such as aca­demics, em­ploy­ment agen­cies and elder­care train­ers to en­sure the find­ings were con­sis­tent with the elder­care land­scape and the rec­om­men­da­tions fea­si­ble.</p>
    <p>The find­ings were also pre­sented to six maids in an on­line fo­cus group dis­cus­sion for val­i­da­tion.</p>
    <p>The re­port found three key ar­eas in which the maids faced chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Some were in­ac­cu­rately matched to their care re­cip­i­ents.</p>
    <p>Of the maids in­ter­viewed, 20 per cent were pro­vid­ing a higher level of care than they had been pre­pared for be­fore they were hired.</p>
    <p>Home and Aware sug­gested cre­at­ing a stan­dard care-needs ma­trix to iden­tify the level of care needed, and set­ting up an ac­cred­i­ta­tion sys­tem to cer­tify maids’ care­giv­ing skills and en­sure they are ad­e­quately trained, by pro­vid­ing in­cen­tives to em­ploy­ers to hire trained maids.</p>
    <p>The re­port also noted that the maids were of­ten over­worked, re­sult­ing in care­giver bur­den.</p>
    <p>About 21 of the maids had their sleep dis­rupted reg­u­larly, with more than half hav­ing more than two dis­rup­tions a night.</p>
    <p>The non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions rec­om­mended that leg­is­la­tion be amended for bet­ter pro­tec­tion in clearly defin­ing the work­ing hours, as well as guar­an­teed ac­cess to respite care ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Third, the re­searchers found a lack of in­for­ma­tion and emo­tional sup­port for chal­leng­ing care­giv­ing sit­u­a­tions, which in­cluded maids be­ing sub­jected to ver­bal and phys­i­cal abuse from care re­cip­i­ents.</p>
    <p>Out of 11 maids who were car­ing for an el­derly per­son with de­men­tia, six faced ver­bal abuse while four faced phys­i­cal abuse.</p>
    <p>The NGOs pro­posed cre­at­ing maid-cen­tred re­sources, such as a care­giver sup­port group for maids.</p>
