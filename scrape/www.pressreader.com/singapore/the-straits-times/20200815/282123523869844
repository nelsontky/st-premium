    <p>Keep­ing our guard up against Covid-19 to pre­vent a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions is sound ad­vice (Best de­fence against sec­ond wave is cau­tion, Aug 13).</p>
    <p>Although I com­pletely agree, it seems like so­cial dis­tanc­ing is be­com­ing in­creas­ingly dif­fi­cult as the MRT trains and malls be­gin to see the old fa­mil­iar crowds.</p>
    <p>I have been find­ing my­self in si­t­u­a­tions where, de­spite my best ef­forts, the space is too lit­tle to main­tain a 1m dis­tance from the peo­ple who flank me.</p>
    <p>The many sales and pro­mo­tions over the long National Day week­end at­tracted huge crowds in front of shops. Sim­i­lar scenes could be seen in front of pop­u­lar eater­ies. Even with re­stric­tions on the num­ber of peo­ple al­lowed in­side the out­lets, the crowds out­side were much too large.</p>
    <p>The scene at the MRT sta­tion was not any bet­ter. It was like any other crowded day from pre-Covid-19 times.</p>
    <p>See­ing the large crowd, I in­ten­tion­ally de­cided to skip one train and wait for the next, but that did not help be­cause a large crowd had gath­ered again by the time the next train ar­rived. I had no choice but to get on, hop­ing my mask would be suf­fi­cient pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>To make matters worse, many peo­ple were wear­ing their masks in­cor­rectly; some had them pulled be­low the nose and some even pulled them down to cough.</p>
    <p>It’s well and good to say we must be cau­tious, but when all the non-es­sen­tial shops and restau­rants are open and schools are open, and no seats on pub­lic trans­porta­tion are crossed out, how does one ex­er­cise cau­tion other than wear­ing a mask?</p>
    <p>Tak­ing a les­son from the coun­tries that opened too soon or that re­laxed the rules too early, only to face a resur­gence of the virus, we must not rush to open the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>If we do so, the po­ten­tial harm in the long run could out­weigh any short-term ben­e­fit. Snigdha Sharma (Dr)</p>
