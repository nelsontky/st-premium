    <p>NAN­JING • Dozens of se­nior Chi­nese govern­ment of­fi­cials and busi­ness lead­ers gath­ered at the 2020 World Semi­con­duc­tor Con­fer­ence in Nan­jing, but their usual agenda of trum­pet­ing the na­tion’s chip in­no­va­tion was coloured by fears that their in­dus­try might be next to suf­fer trade sanc­tions from the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The White House’s cam­paign to con­tain China’s tech as­cen­dancy has al­ready shaken up the world’s tech­nol­ogy sup­ply chain and fur­ther re­stric­tions would se­ri­ously set back China’s still-de­vel­op­ing chip in­dus­try, said ex­ec­u­tives in­clud­ing Mr Arthur Ge, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Le­gend Cap­i­tal – an in­vest­ment arm of the par­ent of Len­ovo Group – and Ain­stec chief ex­ec­u­tive Wang Xuguang.</p>
    <p>That was de­spite the re­siliency in China’s chip de­mand, which has been sup­ported by a re­cov­ery in man­u­fac­tur­ing fol­low­ing dis­rup­tions dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The con­fer­ence was held last week.</p>
    <p>“If the US fur­ther hit key ar­eas of Chi­nese tech in­dus­try, for ex­am­ple the ad­vanced chip man­u­fac­tur­ing, the im­pact would be dev­as­tat­ing,” said Mr Ge.</p>
    <p>The White House last month slapped new re­stric­tions on ex­ports to Huawei Tech­nolo­gies amid an es­ca­lat­ing stand-off be­tween the world’s two l argest economies that has al­ready en­snared other Chi­nese tech gi­ants such as Ten­cent Hold­ings and ByteDance.</p>
    <p>The lat­est Amer­i­can rules re­quire any chip com­pa­nies us­ing US tech­nolo­gies to seek li­cences be­fore work­ing for Huawei, ef­fec­tively clos­ing off the loop­holes that the Chi­nese cor­po­ra­tion had ex­plored af­ter ear­lier curbs that threat­ened the sur­vival of its chip­mak­ing unit HiSil­i­con.</p>
    <p>The United States is also con­sid­er­ing new curbs on ex­ports of semi­con­duc­tor man­u­fac­tur­ing equip­ment and as­so­ci­ated soft­ware tools, lasers, sen­sors and other tech­nol­ogy, Reuters re­ported last week.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, Synop­sys, the Moun­tain View, Cal­i­for­nia-based provider of elec­tronic de­sign au­to­ma­tion tools, has sus­pended cooperatio­n with Huawei fol­low­ing the US curbs, its China chair­man Ge Qun said at the con­fer­ence in east­ern China’s Jiangsu prov­ince.</p>
    <p>“The en­tire chip in­dus­try is too frag­ile to de­fend it­self. We are at least 20 years be­hind com­pared with Sil­i­con Val­ley from scale and qual­ity of tal­ent to size of the ecosys­tem,” said Mr Wang of Ain­stec, a Suzhou-based com­pany that de­vel­ops 3D vis­ual chips.</p>
    <p>“If we can pros­per (with the US), that’s the best, but if the sit­u­a­tion doesn’t al­low this to hap­pen, we need to think what we have on our hands.”</p>
    <p>For its part, the Chi­nese govern­ment has stepped up ef­forts to de­fend do­mes­tic tech com­pa­nies and in­crease the in­dus­try’s self­suf­fi­ciency. Last month, it rolled out a se­ries of mea­sures that in­clude tax breaks, tar­iff ex­emp­tions and in­vest­ment in­cen­tives to bol­ster chip­mak­ers and soft­ware pro­duc­ers.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal cor­po­ra­tions are also boost­ing in­vest­ments in re­search and de­vel­op­ment, with state­backed Ts­inghua Un­i­group build­ing a US$22 bil­lion (S$30 bil­lion) mem­ory chip plant in the city of Wuhan.</p>
    <p>Semi­con­duc­tor Man­u­fac­tur­ing In­ter­na­tional Corp (SMIC) re­cently com­pleted a sec­ondary list­ing in Shang­hai, rais­ing more than US$7.6 bil­lion that would be used to de­velop next-gen­er­a­tion chip­mak­ing tech­nolo­gies to com­pete with ri­vals such as Tai­wan Semi­con­duc­tor Man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>Ts­inghua Un­i­group and SMIC, along with HiSil­i­con and Cam­bri­con Tech­nolo­gies, are among a hand­ful of home-grown firms that are en­gaged i n ad­vanced chip man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>“Although no one wants to say this, the world is ap­proach­ing a new Cold War era. I’m afraid this trend will get stronger in the fu­ture,” said Mr Li Xing, co-founder of Bei­jing-based pri­vate eq­uity com­pany V Fund and a for­mer Gold­man Sachs Group ex­ec­u­tive.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, the chal­lenge could be­come an op­por­tu­nity for the in­dus­try” as China seeks lo­cal re­place­ments, he said.</p>
