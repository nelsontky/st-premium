    <p>The buzz may be re­turn­ing in Sin­ga­pore’s real es­tate in­vest­ment sales mar­ket, with in­ter­est and ac­tiv­ity re­cov­er­ing in the com­mer­cial sec­tor, in par­tic­u­lar dur­ing the July to Septem­ber quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Yet in­vest­ment sales – defined as trans­ac­tions to­talling $10 mil­lion and more – were still down 55.1 per cent year on year in the third quar­ter at about $4.4 bil­lion, ac­cord­ing to Knight Frank yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It also noted that there were no trans­ac­tions com­pleted in the pub­lic sec­tor dur­ing the three months as no sites were sold un­der the gov­ern­ment land sales pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Sig­nif­i­cant com­mer­cial deals were “preva­lent” as the econ­omy be­gan to re­open af­ter Covid-19 pan­demic-re­lated re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Such deals were led by the sale of a half stake in Frasers Prop­erty’s North­point City (South Wing) to TCC Group for $550 mil­lion and the sale of Robin­son Point by Tuan Sing Hold­ings for $500 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>“There re­mains sub­stan­tial in­ter­est for com­mer­cial prop­er­ties, es­pe­cially in the cen­tral business district (CBD) with the po­ten­tial of ex­ist­ing build­ings tap­ping into the CBD In­cen­tive Scheme,” the re­search team wrote.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there is lim­ited saleable stock avail­able for such prop­er­ties, it added.</p>
    <p>For­eign in­vestors are still keen on ex­pand­ing their oper­a­tions from Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“The likes of Alibaba ac­quir­ing a 50 per cent stake in AXA Tower ear­lier in May and ByteDance look­ing to set up in Sin­ga­pore are just the be­gin­ning of the po­ten­tial de­mand com­ing from China-based tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies,” Knight Frank said.</p>
    <p>In the year ahead, tech­nol­ogy firms are likely to show in­creas­ing in­ter­est in ac­quir­ing com­mer­cial prop­er­ties for re­gional bases, it noted.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, de­mand in the res­i­den­tial sec­tor was found to be “par­tic­u­larly re­silient” in the Good Class Bun­ga­low (GCB) seg­ment.</p>
    <p>A string of deals to­talled some $128.3 mil­lion dur­ing the third quar­ter – com­ing close to the $166.4 mil­lion recorded in the first half of this year. This demon­strated “a strong re­cov­ery in de­mand”, said Knight Frank.</p>
    <p>Key trans­ac­tions in the past three months in­cluded the sale of GCBs in Gar­lick Av­enue.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily of Sin­ga­porean bil­lion­aire Goh Cheng Liang was said to be the buyer of an old bun­ga­low sit­ting on 101,550 sq ft of free­hold land with the price un­der­stood to be about $93 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>But even as trad­ing in Sin­ga­pore’s ul­tra-luxe homes has con­tin­ued amid the pan­demic, hit­ting the 2019 vol­ume may be un­likely as buy­ers are now more se­lec­tive, ERA Realty’s head of the GCB di­vi­sion, Mr Henry Lim, said re­cently.</p>
    <p>In­vest­ment sales of in­dus­trial prop­er­ties grew to $406.6 mil­lion in the third quar­ter amid im­proved sen­ti­ment.</p>
    <p>A ware­house was sold to AIMS Apac Reit for $129.6 mil­lion, while a business park de­vel­op­ment at 26A Ayer Ra­jah Cres­cent by Maple­tree In­dus­trial Trust was bought by Equinix Sin­ga­pore for $125 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>But over­all in­vest­ment sales by Sin­ga­pore-based en­ti­ties overseas were lack­lus­tre dur­ing the quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Out­bound in­vest­ment sales from in­vestors here shrank 24.3 per cent, from $3.7 bil­lion in the third quar­ter last year to $2.8 bil­lion, based on Real Cap­i­tal An­a­lyt­ics.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor out­bound deals in­cluded the ac­qui­si­tion of a low-den­sity prime res­i­den­tial de­vel­op­ment site in Shang­hai by a joint ven­ture be­tween Yan­lord Land Group and Huafa In­dus­trial for 4.5 bil­lion yuan (S$909 mil­lion), Knight Frank said.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel Reit also bought free­hold Grade A com­mer­cial prop­erty Pin­na­cle Of­fice Park in Syd­ney for A$306 mil­lion (S$298 mil­lion), its man­ager an­nounced last month.</p>
    <p>The Knight Frank re­search team said that de­spite the Covid-19 out­break, Sin­ga­pore re­mains an at­trac­tive des­ti­na­tion for for­eign in­vestors, ow­ing to its com­par­a­tively sta­ble eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal en­vi­ron­ment, which is not as ex­posed as other gate­way cities to geopo­lit­i­cal un­cer­tain­ties.</p>
    <p>It ex­pects de­mand for in­vest­ment prop­er­ties in Sin­ga­pore to in­crease in the com­ing months, as in­vestors are keen to con­tinue lever­ag­ing avail­able op­por­tu­ni­ties and low in­ter­est rates.</p>
    <p>Ms Chris­tine Li, Cush­man & Wake­field’s head of business de­vel­op­ment ser­vices for Sin­ga­pore and South-east Asia, noted in Au­gust that real es­tate was be­ing of­fered to in­vestors at lower prices.</p>
    <p>Op­por­tu­ni­ties in the in­vest­ment sales mar­ket could thus emerge with 10 per cent to 20 per cent dis­counts from pre-Covid lev­els a couple of quar­ters down the road, Ms Li said then.</p>
