    <p>BANGKOK • Thai­land’s po­lice said yes­ter­day that they would look into why crim­i­nal charges were dropped against the heir to the Red Bull en­ergy drink for­tune, who was ac­cused of a 2012 hit-and-run killing of a po­lice of­fi­cer while driv­ing a sports car.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to drop the charges against Mr Vo­rayuth “Boss” Yoovid­hya has stirred pub­lic anger about the coun­try’s en­trenched cul­ture of im­punity for the rich and well-connected. The charges had in­cluded speed­ing, hit-and-run and reck­less driv­ing caus­ing death.</p>
    <p>The po­lice had ini­tially de­fended the de­ci­sion, say­ing the at­tor­ney­gen­eral’s of­fice had sent them a let­ter in June in­form­ing them that the charges were be­ing dropped.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing a week­end of vit­riol on Twit­ter which led to trend­ing hash­tags like #Boy­cottRedBul­l and #BossRedBul­l, the po­lice an­nounced the probe.</p>
    <p>“A com­mit­tee has been set up to as­cer­tain the facts for trans­parency and fair­ness to all par­ties with re­gard to ac­tions of the po­lice, en­sur­ing they were act­ing in ac­cor­dance with the law and reg­u­la­tions,” the po­lice said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The com­mit­tee will re­port its find­ings in 15 days. The Of­fice of the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral also said it would in­ves­ti­gate the de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Red Bull has sought to dis­tance it­self from Mr Vo­rayuth, the grand­son of the late Cha­leo Yoovid­hya, who cre­ated the en­ergy drink Krat­ing Daeng, or Red Bull.</p>
    <p>Mr Vo­rayuth, who was 27 at the time, was ac­cused of crash­ing his Fer­rari into a po­lice­man and drag­ging his body un­der the car for dozens of me­tres be­fore flee­ing the scene. He missed eight court sum­monses over the case be­fore the au­thor­i­ties is­sued an ar­rest war­rant five years af­ter the in­ci­dent. He later dis­ap­peared, ap­par­ently abroad, so­cial me­dia posts said.</p>
    <p>The of­fice of Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha said on Sun­day that news of the dropped case made him “un­com­fort­able” and stressed that he had never granted per­sonal favours.</p>
