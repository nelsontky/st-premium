    <p>The Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore is ex­tend­ing its free Gallery In­sider mem­ber­ship pro­mo­tion till Jan 31.</p>
    <p>The pro­mo­tion for the mem­ber­ship, which of­fers un­lim­ited ac­cess to ex­hi­bi­tions and is worth up to $120, was orig­i­nally sched­uled to end last month. Mem­ber­ship is avail­able to Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>The ex­ten­sion is part of the Gallery’s ex­panded public en­gage­ment as it turns five this year.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Gallery’s chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Chong Siak Ching said at a press con­fer­ence on Tues­day: “As we com­mem­o­rate our fifth an­niver­sary dur­ing these chal­leng­ing and un­prece­dented times, we want to ex­tend the pos­i­tive im­pact of art to the di­verse com­mu­ni­ties within our so­ci­ety and let art be a source of re­lief, com­fort and in­spi­ra­tion to the na­tion, as we over­come this cri­sis to­gether.”</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has forced the Gallery to can­cel an an­tic­i­pated block­buster, Pi­casso & Matisse, sched­uled in May. But it has also sharp­ened the Gallery’s fo­cus on Sin­ga­pore and its role here.</p>
    <p>As the Na­tional Gallery’s chair­man Hsieh Fu Hua noted in a video mes­sage: “The im­por­tance of the Gallery is re­ally about how we worm our­selves into the heart of the peo­ple of Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>There will be a new ini­tia­tive to kick-start di­a­logue with the public so that Sin­ga­pore­ans can of­fer feed­back and sug­ges­tions about the Gallery. Details of this out­reach will be re­leased later this year.</p>
    <p>A new Adopt Now crowd­fund­ing drive hopes to en­cour­age more Sin­ga­pore­ans to give to the arts. Donors can use the Gallery Ex­plorer app to adopt a work of art from as lit­tle as $50.</p>
    <p>Two up­com­ing ex­hi­bi­tions will also high­light Sin­ga­porean artists. Open­ing on Nov 27 is the first ret­ro­spec­tive show ded­i­cated to pi­o­neer­ing Nanyang artist Ge­or­gette Chen in 20 years.</p>
    <p>Ge­or­gette Chen: At Home In The World will high­light lit­tle-known as­pects of the cel­e­brated artist, such as her ties with the Malay artis­tic com­mu­nity through the Angkatan Pelukis Aneka Daya (As­so­ci­a­tion of Artists of Var­i­ous Re­sources, Apad).</p>
    <p>Open­ing in May is Some­thing</p>
    <p>New Must Turn Up: Six Sin­ga­porean Artists After Merdeka, which will show­case the works of Chng Seok Tin, Goh Beng Kwan, Jaa­far Lat­iff, Lin Hsin Hsin, Mo­ham­mad Din Mo­ham­mad and Eng Tow.</p>
    <p>In its short life­span, Ms Chong said the Gallery had made an im­pres­sion glob­ally by co-pre­sent­ing shows such at Lat­iff Mo­hidin: Pago Pago at the Cen­tre Pom­pi­dou and win­ning ac­co­lades such as the 2018 Chil­dren in Mu­se­ums Award or­gan­ised by the Euro­pean Mu­seum Acad­emy and Hands On! In­ter­na­tional As­so­ci­a­tion of Chil­dren in Mu­se­ums.</p>
    <p>Five years, she noted, is “a very short time in the life of a mu­seum” in a scene where some in­sti­tu­tions date back 50, even 300 years: “So, there is much for us to do, to learn and to im­prove.”</p>
    <p>The mu­seum is com­mit­ted to the role that art can play in so­ci­ety, she said: “There­fore, as we plan our way for­ward, we want to re­new our com­mit­ment to share the value of art with as many peo­ple as pos­si­ble, and make art ac­ces­si­ble to ev­ery­one.”</p>
