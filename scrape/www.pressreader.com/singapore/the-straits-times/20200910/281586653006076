    <p>Malaysian busi­ness­man John Soh Chee Wen and his girl­friend Quah Su-Ling have failed in their bid to stay crim­i­nal pro­ceed­ings against them. They are fac­ing 189 charges and 178 charges, re­spec­tively, for their role in the penny stock crash of 2013.</p>
    <p>Malaysian busi­ness­man John Soh Chee Wen and his girl­friend Quah Su-Ling, who are ac­cused of mas­ter­mind­ing Sin­ga­pore’s most se­ri­ous case of stock mar­ket ma­nip­u­la­tion, have failed in their bid to stay crim­i­nal pro­ceed­ings against them.</p>
    <p>Soh and Quah, who are fac­ing 189 charges and 178 charges re­spec­tively for their role in the penny stock crash of 2013, which wiped out $8 bil­lion in mar­ket value, claimed that “the pros­e­cu­tion’s con­duct of the trial thus far had se­ri­ously prej­u­diced them, ren­der­ing a fair trial im­pos­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>But High Court judge Hoo Sheau Peng said in a judg­ment is­sued last week that she “did not think that a per­ma­nent stay of crim­i­nal pro­ceed­ings was jus­ti­fied on any or all of the grounds (they) ad­vanced”.</p>
    <p>From Oc­to­ber 2012 to Oc­to­ber 2013, con­tra trad­ing accounted for about 31 per cent of to­tal trad­ing value on the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change. It was al­legedly ex­ploited by Soh and Quah to ma­nip­u­late the stocks of Blu­mont Group, Asi­a­sons Cap­i­tal (now At­ti­lan Group) and LionGold Corp. Prices of these stocks nose­dived in early Oc­to­ber 2013 and $8 bil­lion in mar­ket value evap­o­rated as a re­sult.</p>
    <p>Soh claimed that the pros­e­cu­tion failed to act care­fully and dili­gently in bring­ing the charges against him, and had al­legedly made er­rors in the data ev­i­dence pro­vided. Both Soh and Quah claimed that the pros­e­cu­tion was “ef­fec­tively wag­ing a war of at­tri­tion” in­stead of con­duct­ing the trial in an ex­pe­di­tious man­ner.</p>
    <p>But Jus­tice Hoo found that “even tak­ing into con­sid­er­a­tion the lengthy pe­riod of in­ves­ti­ga­tions prior to the trial, and the amend­ment of 30 charges at the com­mit­tal hear­ing stage, the amend­ment of the 178 charges dur­ing the trial was not ir­re­me­di­a­bly un­fair... to the ac­cused per­sons such as to ren­der a fair trial im­pos­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>On their claim of “pros­e­cu­tion by at­tri­tion”, Soh and Quah con­tended that the pros­e­cu­tion had “caused de­lay to the pro­ceed­ings ei­ther de­lib­er­ately or through in­com­pe­tence”.</p>
    <p>They cited an “‘ex­cep­tion­ally lengthy’ ex­am­i­na­tion-in-chief of the pros­e­cu­tion wit­nesses, de­spite the use of con­di­tioned state­ments pre­pared”.</p>
    <p>But Jus­tice Hoo dis­agreed. “The length of the ex­am­i­na­tion-in-chief re­flected the scale and com­plex­ity of the case, and the amount of ev­i­dence to be ad­duced from some of the key wit­nesses.”</p>
    <p>She also dis­agreed with their claim that “‘nu­mer­ous er­rors in the data pro­vided’ by the pros­e­cu­tion led to a waste of trial time and sub­stan­tial costs, thereby jus­ti­fy­ing a per­ma­nent stay of crim­i­nal pro­ceed­ings”.</p>
    <p>While Jus­tice Hoo noted that the pros­e­cu­tion and in­ves­ti­ga­tion agen­cies should have been more metic­u­lous and rig­or­ous in terms of trial prepa­ra­tion, she found that the pros­e­cu­tion has “tried its best to ad­dress the prob­lems and... would re­solve any is­sues in the de­fence’s favour where gaps in in­for­ma­tion per­sisted”.</p>
