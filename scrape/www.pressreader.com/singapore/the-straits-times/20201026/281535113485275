    <p>Two large Aus­tralian re­new­able en­ergy projects that aim to pro­vide green en­ergy to Sin­ga­pore have reached key mile­stones. Both projects are part of a grow­ing vi­sion by de­vel­op­ers and the Aus­tralian gov­ern­ment to cap­ture the coun­try’s re­new­able en­ergy re­sources to meet Asia’s en­ergy needs.</p>
    <p>An In­dian firm is the world’s largest so­lar com­pany to­day.</p>
    <p>A global rank­ing last month re­vealed that Adani Green En­ergy (Agel), part of the Adani Group con­glom­er­ate, had over­taken Hong Kong’s GCL New En­ergy to be­come the world’s top so­lar de­vel­oper.</p>
    <p>The five-year-old Adani’s sprint to the top was pos­si­ble thanks to an In­dian gov­ern­ment con­tract in Jan­uary to build 8 gi­gawatts (GW) of large-scale so­lar ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>The world’s big­gest so­lar off­take award took Adani’s to­tal so­lar port­fo­lio to 12.3GW – roughly 70 per cent larger than GCL.</p>
    <p>One gi­gawatt can power more than a mil­lion In­dian homes.</p>
    <p>Based in Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi’s home state of Gu­jarat, Adani has in many ways mir­rored In­dia’s own in­ter­est and com­mit­ment to so­lar power.</p>
    <p>In 2015, he de­clared In­dia’s so­lar tar­get: 100GW by 2022. That year, Adani set up its first so­lar project.</p>
    <p>At a United Na­tions con­fer­ence last year, Mr Modi an­nounced that In­dia would raise its re­new­able en­ergy ca­pac­ity to 450GW by 2030, and dou­ble the share of non-fos­sil sources from 21 per cent to 40 per cent by 2030.</p>
    <p>Adani chair­man Gau­tam Adani, known to be close to the Prime Min­is­ter, wrote on LinkedIn soon af­ter: “The Adani Group has moved quickly into a po­si­tion to lead this clean en­ergy trans­for­ma­tion.”</p>
    <p>At the end of Au­gust, In­dian so­lar power plants’ pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity was only around 37GW ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s am­bi­tious so­lar leap to its tar­get will now be led by a con­glom­er­ate that is also In­dia’s big­gest pri­vate ther­mal power pro­ducer.</p>
    <p>The Adani Group has a con­tro­ver­sial record of en­vi­ron­men­tal dam­age through its coal port on In­dia’s western coast­line.</p>
    <p>Its mas­sive Carmichael coal mine in Aus­tralia and ex­ports of coal through rail­way lines and a sea ter­mi­nal will spur car­bon pol­lu­tion and could se­ri­ously harm the en­vi­ron­men­tally sen­si­tive Great Bar­rier Reef, cli­mate sci­en­tists say.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is ex­pand­ing its clean en­ergy port­fo­lio, even sit­ting out In­dia’s first-ever auc­tion of coal de­posits for com­mer­cial min­ing that is now on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>“World­wide, large con­sumers, power dis­tri­bu­tion com­pa­nies and gov­ern­ments are push­ing for re­new­ables be­cause of coal’s higher price and en­vi­ron­men­tal costs. As a big con­glom­er­ate, Adani con­tin­ues to invest in coal, but see­ing the global trend, its ra­tio of re­new­ables and ther­mal is shift­ing,” said Mr Vi­nay Ras­togi, founder of Del­hibased en­ergy anal­y­sis firm Bridge To In­dia.</p>
    <p>Re­flect­ing the new em­pha­sis of In­dia’s Min­istry of New and Re­new­able En­ergy, Adani an­nounced in Jan­uary that it wanted to in­di­genise the na­tion’s en­tire so­lar value chain by mak­ing com­po­nents.</p>
    <p>Agel’s new con­tract in­cludes a com­mit­ment to set up man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­ity to make 2GW pho­to­voltaic cells and so­lar pan­els by 2022, in ad­di­tion to the group’s 1.3GW cell man­u­fac­tur­ing plant in Mun­dra, Gu­jarat.</p>
    <p>At the mo­ment, In­dia im­ports 85 per cent of its cell and mod­ule re­quire­ments mostly from China, but also from Viet­nam, Sin­ga­pore and Tai­wan. About 94 per cent of the world’s so­lar com­po­nents are made in China.</p>
    <p>A Bridge To In­dia anal­y­sis said Chi­nese so­lar man­u­fac­tur­ers have a global com­pet­i­tive edge, thanks to fac­tors such as strong gov­ern­ment sup­port, larger scale of pro­duc­tion and ac­cess to in-house tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>To wrest In­dia away from a crip­pling de­pen­dence on Chi­nese com­po­nents, the gov­ern­ment had im­posed a safe­guard duty of 25 per cent on im­ported so­lar cells and pan­els for two years from July 2018, and this year ex­tended the duty at about 15 per cent.</p>
    <p>The du­ties helped a few lo­cal com­pa­nies like Agel to in­crease their mar­ket share, but over­all, were coun­ter­pro­duc­tive as it made so­lar projects costlier, ex­perts say.</p>
    <p>Also, the du­ties ended up slow­ing new so­lar in­stal­la­tions. In­dia’s so­lar en­ergy ad­di­tion fell to 7.3GW last year from 8.3GW in 2018, ac­cord­ing to a re­port by en­ergy anal­y­sis firm Mer­com In­dia Re­search.</p>
    <p>“If In­dia wants mas­sive so­lar ca­pac­ity ad­di­tion, the log­i­cal di­rec­tion now is to­wards mas­sive com­po­nent man­u­fac­tur­ing. There is a thrust now at in­te­grated man­u­fac­tur­ing that cov­ers all four steps – sil­i­con in­gots, wafers, pho­to­voltaic</p>
    <p>cells and mod­ules,” said Mr Praveer Sinha, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Tata Power, which has been up­grad­ing its so­lar mod­ule tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The coun­try cur­rently makes enough so­lar pan­els to pro­duce 16GW power, and enough cells to gen­er­ate 2.5GW. There are al­most 100 mod­ule mak­ers and 15 cell pro­duc­ers, largely for the do­mes­tic mar­ket, but no wafer mak­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Ras­togi said the “highly cap­i­tal-in­ten­sive sec­tor will need large com­pa­nies with deep pock­ets” to invest in so­lar parts.</p>
    <p>At a sym­po­sium on so­lar man­u­fac­tur­ing ear­lier this month, Mr Amitesh Ku­mar Sinha, joint sec­re­tary at the Min­istry of New and Re­new­able En­ergy, said In­dia will need to add at least 30GW of mod­ules, cells, wafers and sil­i­con to meet its so­lar tar­get.</p>
    <p>The min­istry has pro­posed fi­nan­cial in­cen­tives like a per­for­mancelinke­d ex­port pro­gramme and in­ter­est aid. Fol­low­ing bor­der hos­til­i­ties, it will con­tinue im­pos­ing safe­guard duty on Chi­nese im­ports.</p>
    <p>Mr Su­mant Sinha, chair­man of Re­New Power which is set­ting up a 2GW cell and mod­ule pro­duc­tion plant, said: “To re­al­is­ti­cally add 30GW, we will need US$10 bil­lion (S$13.6 bil­lion) to US$15 bil­lion worth of so­lar mod­ules ev­ery year.</p>
    <p>“Wind en­ergy is to­tally indige­nous be­cause the In­dian gov­ern­ment backed the sec­tor early. For so­lar to be In­dia’s cham­pion sec­tor, do­mes­tic man­u­fac­tur­ing is the only way for the sec­tor to be vi­able.”</p>
