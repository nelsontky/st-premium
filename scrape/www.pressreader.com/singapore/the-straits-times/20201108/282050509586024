    <p>One con­se­quence of work­ing from home is that mis­takes are made. Peo­ple miss mes­sages; spin­ning plates fall to the ground; the fal­con can­not hear the fal­coner; a New Yorker jour­nal­ist broad­casts his gen­i­tals to ev­ery­one else on a Zoom call.</p>
    <p>Much has rightly been writ­ten about the emo­tional chal­lenges of re­mote work­ing, the dif­fi­culty of spot­ting col­leagues in dis­tress and the in­ad­e­quacy of e-mail as a way of pro­vid­ing sup­port and kind­ness.</p>
    <p>What gets less at­ten­tion is the sim­ple com­mu­ni­ca­tion er­ror. It is re­mark­able that ac­tiv­i­ties for which face-to-face co­or­di­na­tion seemed es­sen­tial can be con­ducted from kitchen tables across the world. Yet even­tu­ally the cracks start to show: every­thing from missed e-mails caus­ing missed meet­ings to yawn­ing chasms of un­der­stand­ing about fun­da­men­tal goals.</p>
    <p>I have been search­ing for so­lu­tions. One source of in­spi­ra­tion is the hum­ble credit card. I learnt re­cently from A Pod­cast Of Un­nec­es­sary De­tail that what looks like a 16-digit credit card num­ber is in fact a 15-digit num­ber plus a check digit. The check digit is cal­cu­lated us­ing a for­mula that in­volves each of the other dig­its. If any sin­gle digit is mistyped, the check digit will not match; most trans­po­si­tions, such as typ­ing 47 in­stead of 74, will also be de­tected.</p>
    <p>Check dig­its are a spe­cific in­stance of the gen­eral prin­ci­ple that re­dun­dant in­for­ma­tion can re­duce er­rors. Re­dun­dant in­for­ma­tion comes with a cost. It takes up space (if you are a dig­i­tal mes­sage such as a credit card num­ber) or time and at­ten­tion (if you are a hu­man). But the price may be worth pay­ing.</p>
    <p>We can use a pho­netic al­pha­bet, which takes much more time, to give a post­code over a patchy phone line. Do you live in east</p>
    <p>Bris­tol (BS5) or be­tween Shrews­bury and Stoke-on-Trent (TF9)? “Tango Fox­trot Niner” is quite dis­tinct from “Bravo Sierra Five”. Lan­guages such as English al­ready in­clude con­sid­er­able re­dun­dancy. Tht s why y cn prb­bly rd ths sntnc, vn wth th vwls rmvd.</p>
    <p>For meet­ings, I spec­ify both the date and the day of the week. A mis­match is an op­por­tu­nity to no­tice the prob­lem. Au­to­matic er­ror cor­rec­tion is even bet­ter. I used to be ir­ri­tated when peo­ple sent me electronic cal­en­dar in­vi­ta­tions to events I’d al­ready noted down. Now I re­alise it’s a valu­able op­por­tu­nity to make sure ev­ery­one has the same un­der­stand­ing of what is go­ing on.</p>
    <p>A well-crafted in­vi­ta­tion in­cludes the cor­rect link for a meet­ing and the con­tact de­tails of ev­ery­one in­volved, and au­to­mat­i­cally en­sures that ev­ery­one has the same tim­ings, no mat­ter their time­zone. Man­u­ally as­sem­bling such in­for­ma­tion from e-mail chains, phone calls or, worst of all, PDFs of­fers op­por­tu­ni­ties for er­ror.</p>
    <p>Brevity helps if it fo­cuses at­ten­tion on crit­i­cal in­for­ma­tion. Too of­ten I re­ceive e-mails with a sub­ject such as “UR­GENT PLEASE READ”, when the en­tire mes­sage could be within the sub­ject line: “The 4pm meet­ing is post­poned to 4.15pm.”</p>
    <p>But brevity can also be a trap. Tom Standage’s book The Vic­to­rian In­ter­net de­scribes the woes of Philadel­phia wool bro­ker Frank Prim­rose, who in June 1887 sent a tele­gram that used a com­pressed code. (Tele­grams were ex­pen­sive and charged by the letter, so such codes were com­mon.)</p>
    <p>The mes­sage read BUY ALL KINDS QUO rather than BAY ALL KINDS QUO, lead­ing Prim­rose’s agent to er­ro­neously buy half a mil­lion pounds of wool. A lit­tle more re­dun­dancy in the tele­graph mes­sage would have saved Prim­rose a small for­tune. These days, most mes­sages with such high stakes would come with er­ror de­tec­tion built in, as with the check digit on a credit card.</p>
    <p>Cat­a­strophic ty­pos are eas­ily spot­ted, but a more in­sid­i­ous threat is the slow ac­cu­mu­la­tion of what the psy­chol­o­gist James Rea­son calls “la­tent con­di­tions”. In an in­dus­trial con­text, la­tent con­di­tions might in­clude an un­tidy pile of flammable oily rags in the cor­ner of a work­shop, a fire alarm that is out of bat­ter­ies and a blocked fire es­cape. None of these la­tent con­di­tions will cause trou­ble, un­til a stray cig­a­rette causes a fa­tal fire.</p>
    <p>For an or­gan­i­sa­tion with an am­bi­tious project to de­liver, the flat bat­ter­ies and the blocked fire es­cape are metaphor­i­cal. Col­leagues work­ing to­gether on a project can find them­selves labour­ing un­der very dif­fer­ent as­sump­tions about de­liv­er­ables, bud­get, pri­or­i­ties and even who is han­dling which tasks.</p>
    <p>The mis­match of be­liefs can per­sist for a long time un­til a sud­den and per­haps cat­a­strophic mo­ment of re­al­i­sa­tion. As the say­ing goes, it’s not the things you don’t know that cause trou­ble – it’s the things you do know that aren’t true.</p>
    <p>A re­lated is­sue is when some par­tic­i­pants fear that a project is badly flawed, but there is no easy, in­for­mal way for them to pull a su­pe­rior to one side and dis­creetly ex­press their dis­quiet. One can’t help won­der­ing if this sum­mer’s bungling of grades for can­celled exam re­sults in the UK would have been quite so sham­bolic if ev­ery­one con­cerned had reg­u­larly seen each other face to face.</p>
    <p>There is no easy so­lu­tion to this prob­lem. Er­ror de­tec­tion is an end­less process. One pos­si­bil­ity is to re­duce the level of com­plex­ity by pur­su­ing projects that in­volve fewer peo­ple, sim­pler tech­nol­ogy and more slack. An­other is to em­brace brief, fre­quent con­ver­sa­tions to en­sure ev­ery­one is on track. Are we sure this is a good idea? With­out those fre­quent in­for­mal checks, things fall apart.</p>
