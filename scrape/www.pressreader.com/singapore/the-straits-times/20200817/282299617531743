    <p>PRAGUE • Top seed Si­mona Halep yes­ter­day won the Prague Open, but the ques­tion on ev­ery­one’s lips was not about the tour­na­ment, but rather her par­tic­i­pa­tion in the US Open.</p>
    <p>The Ro­ma­nian will make her de­ci­sion to­day.</p>
    <p>Halep be­came the fifth most suc­cess­ful ac­tive player on the WTA Tour be­hind Ser­ena and Venus Wil­liams, Kim Clijsters and Pe­tra Kvi­tova after beat­ing Elise Mertens 6-2, 7-5 in 1 hour and 33 min­utes for her 21st ca­reer sin­gles ti­tle.</p>
    <p>The Bel­gian took a 2-0 lead in the first set, but the Wim­ble­don cham­pion then won seven games in a row to take the first set and start the sec­ond on a high, ex­tend­ing her lead to 4-2.</p>
    <p>Lean­ing on her su­perb back­hand, Mertens put Halep un­der pres­sure with her ag­gres­sive dis­play, com­ing back for a 5-4 lead.</p>
    <p>But that was it from the 24-yearold as the world No. 2 won the next three games to seal the vic­tory.</p>
    <p>The clay-court tour­na­ment, just the sec­ond since the coro­n­avirus pan­demic shut down the sport in March, was played be­hind closed doors.</p>
    <p>“Even the first set was not easy, she’s a great op­po­nent and it’s al­ways tough to play against her be­cause she’s fast,” Halep, 28, told pub­lic broad­caster Czech Tele­vi­sion. “The sec­ond set was a lit­tle bit tougher but I was strong and that’s why I could win this match.”</p>
    <p>On whether she would join the growing list of ab­sen­tees at Flush­ing Mead­ows, sched­uled to start on Aug 31, she added: “Now it’s too fast to take a de­ci­sion, I just want to en­joy this vic­tory and then I will have a thought about the US Open (to­day).”</p>
    <p>Belinda Ben­cic on Satur­day be­came the fifth top-10 women’s player to give the year’s sec­ond Grand Slam a pass after world No. 1 Ashleigh Barty of Aus­tralia, Ukrainian No. 5 Elina Svi­tolina, sev­en­thranked Dutch­woman Kiki Bertens, and de­fend­ing cham­pion Bianca An­dreescu of Canada.</p>
    <p>Swiss Ben­cic said: “I’ve made the dif­fi­cult de­ci­sion to skip the US swing in New York and will re­turn to the Tour start­ing next month in Rome. I’m look­ing for­ward to re­turn­ing to New York next year.”</p>
