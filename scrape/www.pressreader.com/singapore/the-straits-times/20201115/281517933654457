    <p>In­dian and Pak­istani forces have waged their big­gest ar­tillery bat­tle in sev­eral months, leav­ing at least 15 peo­ple slain on ei­ther side of their dis­puted Kash­mir fron­tier, of­fi­cials said. The two sides each ac­cused the other of launch­ing “un­pro­voked” at­tacks on Friday.</p>
    <p>At least 10 civil­ians and five se­cu­rity per­son­nel were killed in cross-bor­der shelling be­tween In­dia and Pak­istan on Friday, in one of this year’s dead­li­est days along the heav­ily mil­i­tarised fron­tier sep­a­rat­ing the nu­clear-armed ri­vals, said of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to In­dian of­fi­cials in Srinagar, the bar­rage of mor­tars and other weapons along sev­eral parts of the Line of Con­trol (LOC) – the de facto bor­der – be­gan after troops from the In­dian army foiled an in­fil­tra­tion at­tempt from Pak­istan in north­ern Kash­mir.</p>
    <p>Pak­istan’s mil­i­tary said in a state­ment it had re­sponded to un­pro­voked and in­dis­crim­i­nate fir­ing by the In­dian army.</p>
    <p>At least five sep­a­rate clashes – in­volv­ing shelling and gun­fire – were re­ported along the 740km cease­fire line that has sep­a­rated the ri­val na­tions for the past seven decades, of­fi­cials from the two sides said.</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of vil­lagers were moved away from the LOC in In­dian-con­trolled ter­ri­tory, while</p>
    <p>Pak­istani of­fi­cials said dozens of homes were set ablaze by In­dian shelling on their side.</p>
    <p>The new peak in ten­sions came only five days after three In­dian sol­diers and three mil­i­tants were killed in an ex­change along the LOC. In­dia is also in­volved in a bor­der show­down with the Chi­nese army in the Hi­malayas.</p>
    <p>In­dian of­fi­cials said six civil­ians, three sol­diers and a bor­der guard were killed on their side.</p>
    <p>The Pak­istan mil­i­tary said four civil­ians and one sol­dier were killed on the Pak­istani side.</p>
    <p>Both In­dia and Pak­istan claim Kash­mir in full.</p>
    <p>Each has ruled part of the re­gion since their an­gry sep­a­ra­tion in 1947, with New Delhi long ac­cus­ing its neigh­bour of fu­elling an in</p>
    <p>sur­gency, which Is­lam­abad de­nies.</p>
    <p>Kash­mir has been a cause of two of their three wars since then.</p>
    <p>In­dian and Pak­istani troops reg­u­larly ex­change fire across the moun­tain­ous bor­der, but the shelling on Friday was par­tic­u­larly in­tense, ac­cord­ing to In­dian of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Both sides also ac­cused the other of fir­ing at civil­ian ar­eas.</p>
    <p>“As usual, they tar­geted civil­ian pop­u­la­tions with­out any re­morse,” said Mr Syed Shahid Qadri, a gov­ern­ment of­fi­cial in Pak­istan-con­trolled Kash­mir, where a woman was among the dead and 27 oth­ers were in­jured.</p>
    <p>Across the bor­der i n In­di­an­ruled Kash­mir, of­fi­cials said an eight-year-old child was among those killed in the shelling that started in the morn­ing and con­tin­ued late into the even­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Mukhtar Ah­mad, a res­i­dent of Uri in In­dian Kash­mir, said there was panic in the hill­side town after loud ex­plo­sions were heard from ar­eas closer to the de facto bor­der.</p>
    <p>“Sev­eral fam­i­lies have fled the area and taken shel­ter i n Uri town,” he said.</p>
    <p>More than 40 civil­ians have been killed in fir­ing be­tween In­dian and Pak­istani troops this year, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial data, with both sides suf­fer­ing sim­i­lar fa­tal­i­ties.</p>
