    <p>she had her epiphany.</p>
    <p>“Some­how, I had lost touch with my in­ner tidy­ing geek. No won­der I wasn’t hav­ing any suc­cess at work.”</p>
    <p>She came in the next day at 7am and had her desk clut­ter-free within an hour.</p>
    <p>While tidy­ing her desk did not make her in­stantly bet­ter at her job, she did feel a lot hap­pier.</p>
    <p>Col­leagues asked her for tidy­ing tips. She would meet clients to de­liver sales pitches and wind up straight­en­ing their desks in­stead. She be­came so in de­mand, she was spend­ing her time off on tidy­ing gigs. Fi­nally, she started her own busi­ness.</p>
    <p>In Joy At Work, she and So­nen­shein, who is Henry Gar­diner Sy­monds Pro­fes­sor of Man­age­ment at Rice Univer­sity, look at how to keep one’s work space tidy.</p>
    <p>This ranges from phys­i­cal mess – from max­imis­ing desk stor­age to cut­ting down on piles of pa­per – to digital clut­ter, like let­ting e-mails pile up or sprawl­ing net­works of con­tacts that re­quire prun­ing.</p>
    <p>They mar­shal statis­tics to demon­strate the eco­nomic cost of clut­ter.</p>
    <p>“The search for lost things adds up to an av­er­age of one work week per year per em­ployee,” they write.</p>
    <p>“The av­er­age of­fice worker wastes two hours and 39 min­utes a week in in­ef­fec­tive meet­ings... The cost of such un­pro­duc­tive meet­ings comes to more than US$3.7 bil­lion (S$5.1 bil­lion) an­nu­ally.”</p>
    <p>Due to the pan­demic, most peo­ple no longer even work in of­fices.</p>
    <p>Kondo main­tains, how­ever, that her tips and tools can be trans­lated to work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>“No mat­ter where you work, it’s im­por­tant to cre­ate an en­vi­ron­ment that helps you fo­cus,” she sug­gests.</p>
    <p>“If you don’t have a home of­fice, iden­tify the items that are cru­cial to get­ting your work done and des­ig­nate a clear spot for them – a box or por­ta­ble car­rier will do.</p>
    <p>“When it’s time to work, move all un­re­lated items off your work space and add one thing that sparks joy when you look at it – I al­ways keep a crys­tal or small vase of fresh flow­ers on my desk.”</p>
    <p>She also be­lieves in hav­ing rit­u­als to mark the start of the work day – a brief stretch, per­haps, or a chant.</p>
    <p>“I strike a tun­ing fork and dif­fuse es­sen­tial oils to sig­nal to my body that I’m switching gears.”</p>
    <p>Kondo stresses the im­por­tance of main­tain­ing a clear divi­sion be­tween work and home life, though she ac­knowl­edges that it can be dif­fi­cult if one is shar­ing space with fam­ily, es­pe­cially small chil­dren.</p>
    <p>She has two young daugh­ters, Sat­suki and Miko, whom she makes meals for and spends more time with now that they are not at school.</p>
    <p>“But I try to make it clear when I am work­ing by shar­ing this in­for­ma­tion with them,” she says.</p>
    <p>“I close the of­fice door when I’m con­duct­ing meet­ings or on calls. They might knock loudly from time to time, but they un­der­stand that there is a boundary and they may have to wait a mo­ment.”</p>
    <p>Pan­demic not­with­stand­ing, Kondo has plenty of projects in the pipe­line. She hopes to start shoot­ing her new Net­flix se­ries soon.</p>
    <p>“We have a very am­bi­tious goal: to tidy a small town in Amer­ica de­serv­ing of joy and change. I’m ner­vous but ex­cited.”</p>
    <p>She also plans to launch new prod­ucts in her on­line shop, which sparked joy – but also con­tro­versy – when she un­veiled it last year.</p>
    <p>It sells a range of fash­ion and home­ware items, from a US$75 tun­ing fork and rose quartz crys­tal to a US$169 med­i­ta­tion floor cush­ion.</p>
    <p>Some on so­cial me­dia crit­i­cised her for sell­ing such prod­ucts when her phi­los­o­phy re­volves around con­vinc­ing peo­ple to dis­card their pos­ses­sions if they do not spark joy.</p>
    <p>Kondo says: “We lis­ten to our com­mu­nity’s feed­back about what they need to sup­port their tidy­ing – or what sparks joy for them – and we strive to of­fer that.”</p>
    <p>Though her de­clut­ter­ing meth­ods have come un­der fire for gen­er­at­ing waste, as more peo­ple throw things out, she begs to dif­fer.</p>
    <p>“There is an op­por­tu­nity to learn from all of the items in your life. If you let go of a be­long­ing you never used, it taught you that you have no use in your life for some­thing like this. This knowl­edge will help you avoid mak­ing a sim­i­lar mis­take going forward.</p>
    <p>“Think­ing deeply about each thing you let go of will help you to be more mind­ful of how you shop and ac­quire items mov­ing forward – which will ul­ti­mately lead to less waste.”</p>
