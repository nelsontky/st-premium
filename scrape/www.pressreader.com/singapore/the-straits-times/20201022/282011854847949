    <p>A man who al­legedly drove up to a med­i­cal cen­tre near the Paya Le­bar Air Force Train­ing Com­mand claim­ing he had ex­plo­sives in his ve­hi­cle has been charged in court with a law passed soon af­ter the Sept 11, 2001 at­tacks in the United States.</p>
    <p>Zayd Hashim Si­raj is said to have driven up to the Sin­ga­pore Aeromed­i­cal Cen­tre in Air­port Road on Mon­day, where he told Sta­tion In­spec­tor Go Kheng Wah that he had ex­plo­sives in his car.</p>
    <p>The 30-year-old was charged yes­ter­day with an of­fence un­der the United Na­tions (Anti-Ter­ror­ism Mea­sures) Reg­u­la­tions, which was adopted by mem­ber states of the UN to deal with ter­ror­ism and the fi­nanc­ing of ter­ror­ism.</p>
    <p>There was no in­di­ca­tion in court doc­u­ments if a device was found in his car, and his mo­ti­va­tion for al­legedly car­ry­ing out the threat.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean is cur­rently re­manded at the In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health for psy­chi­atric ob­ser­va­tion.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to its web­site, the Sin­ga­pore Aeromed­i­cal Cen­tre spe­cialises in oc­cu­pa­tional and avi­a­tion medicine. It is also in­volved in the phys­i­o­log­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion and train­ing of pi­lots and others.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent hap­pened on Mon­day be­tween 3.26pm and 3.55pm.</p>
    <p>A check on the Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Au­thor­ity’s web­site shows Zayd is the manag­ing direc­tor of a firm called Alt­na­tive Group. His case has been ad­journed to Nov 4.</p>
    <p>If con­victed of the of­fence, he can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined up to $500,000.</p>
    <p>If con­victed of the of­fence, he can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined up to $500,000.</p>
