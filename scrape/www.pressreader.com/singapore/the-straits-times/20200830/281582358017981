    <p>A to­tal of 300 peo­ple were evac­u­ated in the wee hours of yes­ter­day morn­ing, af­ter a fire broke out at The Peak in Toa Payoh.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force was alerted to a fire at Block 138C, Lorong 1A Toa Payoh, at about 2.55am yes­ter­day, it said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>The fire at the Hous­ing Board block in­volved the con­tents of a unit on the 20th floor and also af­fected a unit di­rectly above on the 21st floor.</p>
    <p>Three peo­ple from the unit on the 20th floor were taken to Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal with burn in­juries and smoke in­hala­tion. Those who were evac­u­ated have since re­turned to their homes.</p>
    <p>Upon ar­rival at The Peak, fire­fight­ers with breath­ing ap­pa­ra­tus im­me­di­ately pro­ceeded to the burn­ing unit, where they man­aged to ex­tin­guish the fire.</p>
    <p>They res­cued two peo­ple who were found in a bath­room. An­other oc­cu­pant had evac­u­ated be­fore the SCDF’s ar­rival.</p>
    <p>At the same time, fire­fight­ers forced their way into the unit on the floor above and ex­tin­guished the fire there as well. Oc­cu­pants of this unit had also evac­u­ated be­fore the SCDF ar­rived.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for For­eign Af­fairs and Trans­port Chee Hong Tat thanked res­i­dents who alerted their neigh­bours and called the SCDF. “Your quick re­sponse has helped to save lives and en­abled af­fected res­i­dents to evac­u­ate safely. I am heart­ened to learn about neigh­bours help­ing one an­other dur­ing this emer­gency. Thanks also to our SCDF fire­fight­ers for putting out the fire and keep­ing every­one safe,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Bis­han-Toa Payoh GRC MP added that the in­ci­dent is also a re­minder of the im­por­tance of fire safety and evac­u­a­tion pro­ce­dures, and why com­mon cor­ri­dors and stair wells must be kept un­blocked to en­sure every­one’s safety.</p>
    <p>An eye­wit­ness who lives at Block 139B and wants to be known only as Mrs Tan said: “Screams of ‘fire’ woke us up and we saw a unit in the op­po­site block en­gulfed in flames. All the neigh­bour­ing blocks in the es­tate chimed in and started yelling to­gether to arouse the sleep­ing neigh­bours around the burn­ing unit to evac­u­ate.”</p>
    <p>The cause of the fire is be­ing in­ves­ti­gated.</p>
    <p>Three peo­ple from the unit on the 20th floor were taken to Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal with burn in­juries and smoke in­hala­tion. Those who were evac­u­ated have since re­turned to their homes.</p>
