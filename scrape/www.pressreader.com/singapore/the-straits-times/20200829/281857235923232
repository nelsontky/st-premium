    <p>• Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son will launch a pub­lic cam­paign next week to get Bri­tain back to the work­place, as min­is­ters warned that work­ing from home will make peo­ple more vul­ner­a­ble to be­ing sacked, The Tele­graph news­pa­per re­ported.</p>
    <p>The cam­paign will ex­tol the virtues of re­turn­ing to the of­fice and pro­vide re­as­sur­ance that it is a safe place, while a new on­line tool will help peo­ple avoid the most crowded trains and buses, the re­port on Thurs­day said.</p>
    <p>“There will be three main mes­sages – show­ing peo­ple the work­place is a safe place to re­turn to; high­light­ing the so­cial ben­e­fits and the emo­tional case for go­ing back to the of­fice; and en­cour­ag­ing peo­ple to plan how they are go­ing to go back so they feel con­fi­dent about do­ing so,” it added, quot­ing a gov­ern­ment source.</p>
    <p>The re­port said Fi­nance Min­is­ter Rishi Su­nak is wor­ried about fur­ther job losses, as well as the fi­nan­cial cost of run­ning nearempty trains and buses.</p>
    <p>“Clearly, peo­ple should be go­ing back to work be­cause it is safe to do so. There are al­ready prob­lems with work­ers’ men­tal health. It’s not just about hard­nosed eco­nom­ics,” the re­port said, cit­ing a Cab­i­net min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>“There will be some economic con­se­quences of shut­down. Com­pa­nies will re­alise some peo­ple weren’t work­ing as hard as they thought… There is go­ing to be a re­view of how pro­duc­tive peo­ple are.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Bri­tish think­tank Cen­tre for Cities, only 17 per cent of work­ers in Bri­tish cities had re­turned to their work­places by early this month.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son last month en­cour­aged peo­ple work­ing from home to get back to their work­places to help the econ­omy re­cover from its 20 per cent contractio­n in the April-June pe­riod.</p>
