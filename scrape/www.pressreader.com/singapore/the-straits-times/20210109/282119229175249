    <p>Each year, the Philip­pines gen­er­ates enough garbage to fill more than 23,000 Olympic-size swim­ming pools. Much of that does not end up in land­fills, but on side­walks and along canals, creeks, rivers and shore­lines. The Covid-19 pan­demic has made things worse.</p>
    <p>In a month, a sin­gle hos­pi­tal can dump more than 10,000kg of dress­ings, blood and urine bags, spu­tum cups, test tubes and liq­uid waste.</p>
    <p>Due to the pan­demic, hos­pi­tals have had to pro­cure tonnes of masks, face shields, lab gowns and other per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment (PPE) that all even­tu­ally end up in land­fills.</p>
    <p>The Asian Devel­op­ment Bank es­ti­mates that Manila alone – home to close to two mil­lion – dumps 280 tonnes of med­i­cal waste, in­clud­ing masks, a day. That is not sur­pris­ing. Last Au­gust, close to 58 mil­lion masks were com­ing out of fac­to­ries that tur­bocharged pro­duc­tion amid a dearth in sup­ply.</p>
    <p>But most of this waste comes from hos­pi­tals, clin­ics and labs, which by law have to seg­re­gate, dis­in­fect and la­bel bio­haz­ard waste be­fore they turn these over for dis­posal in land­fills.</p>
    <p>Largely un­ac­counted for are masks, face shields, gloves, hand sani­tiser and other PPE used by the public.</p>
    <p>The vol­ume is likely mas­sive. “We rank sec­ond in South­east Asia with the most num­ber of Covid-19 cases. We can just imag­ine how stag­ger­ing the fig­ures would be for the dis­pos­able PPE be­ing used daily and dis­carded,” said Ms Glo­ria Ramos, vice-pres­i­dent of con­ser­va­tion group Oceana Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>Filipinos are Asia’s top users of masks, due to a gov­ern­ment man­date re­quir­ing ev­ery­one to wear masks and face shields when go­ing out. A sur­vey last Septem­ber showed four in five Filipinos comply with this rule.</p>
    <p>En­vi­ron­ment and health of­fi­cials are al­ways re­mind­ing the public to seg­re­gate their masks and face shields for sep­a­rate dis­posal. But this seems to be the ex­tent of their re­mit, and an al­ready pan­demic-weary public isn’t too ea­ger to comply.</p>
    <p>Nearly ev­ery house­hold lumps its masks, gloves and face shields with its other garbage. In poor dis­tricts where no one comes to col­lect the garbage, it is bun­dled in plas­tic bags that are thrown into the near­est dump, creek or river, and ul­ti­mately end up in the world’s oceans.</p>
    <p>“Sin­gle-use plas­tic is al­ready a prob­lem. What we’re see­ing on the sur­face is only the tip of the ice­berg. There’s so much ly­ing on the ocean floor – and now not just plas­tics, but face masks too,” said Ms Ramos.</p>
    <p>Groups like Green­peace and public health ad­vo­cates are urg­ing the gov­ern­ment to step up its push for the public to use re­us­able masks and stay home as much as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>The En­vi­ron­ment Min­istry is toy­ing with the idea of loos­en­ing the Clean Air Act to al­low in­cin­er­a­tion of med­i­cal waste. But that does not sit well with en­vi­ron­ment ad­vo­cates.</p>
    <p>Ms Mar­ian Ledesma, a cam­paigner for Green­peace Philip­pines, said: “That’s some­thing we don’t sup­port… It re­ally just opens an­other can of worms.”</p>
    <p>She added that in­cin­er­at­ing garbage, es­pe­cially plas­ticbased waste like masks, will re­lease toxic fumes into the air, caus­ing res­pi­ra­tory ill­nesses that could aid the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>En­vi­ron­ment Un­der­sec­re­tary Benny An­tiporda, who over­sees lo­cal gov­ern­ment units and solid waste man­age­ment, said in­cin­er­a­tion is “Plan Z” – the very last re­sort.</p>
    <p>In­stead, 10 to 30 new san­i­tary land­fills will be built, he said, al­though it will take at least six months for one to be up and ready. Only two land­fills cur­rently han­dle Metro Manila’s med­i­cal and bio­haz­ard waste.</p>
