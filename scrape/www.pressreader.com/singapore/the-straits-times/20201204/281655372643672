    <p>Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Ed­u­ca­tion Ma­liki Os­man will be lead­ing a re­view to see what more his min­istry can do to en­sure that grad­u­ates from the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion (ITE) and the five poly­tech­nics are pre­pared for the work­ing world.</p>
    <p>An­nounc­ing the re­view yes­ter­day, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said it will be im­por­tant to en­sure that the grad­u­ates “ac­quire deep skills and com­pe­ten­cies that are well matched to their in­ter­ests, and also the needs of em­ploy­ers and the in­dus­try”.</p>
    <p>More in­for­ma­tion on the re­view will be shared later.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said that di­verse path­ways for stu­dents is a ma­jor strength that Sin­ga­pore must con­tinue to up­hold.</p>
    <p>“Around the world, too many coun­tries have shifted to an overly aca­demic model of ter­tiary or univer­sity ed­u­ca­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I think in Sin­ga­pore, we have been for­tu­nate to avoid some of th­ese im­bal­ances, be­cause we have paid a lot of at­ten­tion over the years to our tech­ni­cal and vo­ca­tional train­ing. That is why we have al­ways said that ITE is the jewel in our ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>The “gold stan­dard” for tech­ni­cal and vo­ca­tional train­ing is Ger­many, he noted.</p>
    <p>It has a dual-track sys­tem where stu­dents will com­plete a three­year ap­pren­tice­ship with a com­pany – spend­ing about half their time learn­ing on the job, and the other half in a vo­ca­tional train­ing school.</p>
    <p>Such a sys­tem, un­der­taken by about half of the co­hort in Ger­many, is re­garded very highly by so­ci­ety, he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, too, has started work­study pro­grammes in the in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing, es­pe­cially ITE and poly­tech­nics.</p>
    <p>ITE now of­fers 24 work-study diploma pro­grammes, which are ap­pren­tice­ship-based pro­grammes with 70 per cent of the course de­liv­ered through struc­tured, onthe-job train­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said: “They are an im­por­tant ap­plied path­way for stu­dents to learn, ac­quire deep skills and rel­e­vant work ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>“We are start­ing from a strong po­si­tion but there is still more that can be done in this space.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wong was speak­ing at the first ses­sion of the NUS115 Dis­tin­guished Speaker Series, or­gan­ised by the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS).</p>
    <p>It was held at the Shaw Foun­da­tion Alumni House with lim­ited par­tic­i­pants, and streamed vir­tu­ally to a wider au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>The series will run un­til the mid­dle or third quar­ter of next year, de­pend­ing on the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.</p>
