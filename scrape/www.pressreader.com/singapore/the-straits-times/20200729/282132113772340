    <p>Traveloka, South-east Asia’s largest on­line travel app, an­nounced yes­ter­day that it had raised US$250 mil­lion (S$345 mil­lion) to bol­ster its oper­a­tions amid the coro­n­avirus cri­sis, and as do­mes­tic travel starts to pick up in the re­gion of 650 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The eight-year-old start-up said its fund­ing round was led by a “global fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion” and in­cluded ex­ist­ing in­vestors, such as early backer East Ven­tures.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier back­ers in­clude Amer­i­can travel gi­ant Ex­pe­dia, Chi­nese on­line re­tailer JD.com and Sin­ga­pore state wealth fund GIC.</p>
    <p>Traveloka, which claims more than 60 mil­lion down­loads, has been bat­tered by the virus out­break, as South-east Asian coun­tries shut borders and im­posed strict lock­downs, throt­tling a pre­vi­ously boom­ing tourism in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The start-up has cut jobs, with one of its af­fil­i­ates, In­done­sian ho­tel ag­gre­ga­tor Airy Rooms, shut­ting down.</p>
    <p>But as do­mes­tic travel re­stric­tions start to ease in the re­gion, the Jakarta-based firm’s chief ex­ec­u­tive said it “was see­ing an en­cour­ag­ing re­cov­ery across its key mar­kets” due to a resur­gence in travel and ac­tiv­ity book­ings by lo­cal hol­i­day-mak­ers.</p>
    <p>“Our busi­ness in Viet­nam has re­turned to 100 per cent preCovid-19 level and Thai­land has sur­passed 50 per cent pre-Covi­dlevel,” Traveloka co-founder and CEO Ferry Unardi said.</p>
    <p>He noted that both In­done­sia and Malaysia were also see­ing “strong week-to-week im­prove­ment”.</p>
    <p>The Thai au­thor­i­ties un­veiled last month a US$722 mil­lion sub­sidy to spur do­mes­tic travel, while both Viet­nam and Sin­ga­pore have an­nounced ex­ten­sive lo­cal tourism pro­mo­tion cam­paigns.</p>
    <p>The In­done­sian is­land of Bali plans to re­open to lo­cal tourists this week and to in­ter­na­tional trav­ellers on Sept 11. Ac­cord­ing to Mr Unardi, Traveloka will use the new fund­ing to bol­ster its bal­ance sheet and boost its do­mes­tic travel of­fer­ings as well as its fi­nan­cial of­fer­ings.</p>
    <p>A source with knowl­edge of the mat­ter told Reuters that the lead in­vestor on the round was the Qatar In­vest­ment Author­ity (QIA), Qatar’s state-owned holding com­pany.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Traveloka de­clined to com­ment on whether QIA had joined the deal or on Traveloka’s val­u­a­tion. QIA did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to re­quests for com­ment.</p>
