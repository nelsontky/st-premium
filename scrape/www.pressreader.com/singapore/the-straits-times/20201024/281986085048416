    <p>Over $5.5 bil­lion will be paid out to em­ploy­ers un­der the Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS) of wage sub­si­dies this month, ben­e­fit­ing some 1.9 mil­lion lo­cal em­ploy­ees. It is the third such pay­out since the scheme was an­nounced in the Bud­get in Fe­bru­ary. It brings the to­tal amount dis­bursed un­der the scheme to more than $21.5 bil­lion. The scheme was re­cently ex­tended to cover wages paid up to March next year for sec­tors harder hit by the Covid-19 cri­sis, and up to De­cem­ber this year for sec­tors that are man­ag­ing well. Those in the avi­a­tion, tourism and built en­vi­ron­ment sec­tors get the high­est tier of sup­port, fol­lowed by those in food ser­vices, re­tail, arts and en­ter­tain­ment, land trans­port, and ma­rine and off­shore.</p>
    <p>While the JSS has been a wel­come move to cush­ion the blow from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the scheme – whose sub­sidy lev­els were re­duced start­ing from Sep­tem­ber – may not be enough on its own to save some firms and jobs. There is un­cer­tainty over whether em­ploy­ees’ wage lev­els can be main­tained, now that the Na­tional Wages Coun­cil has given com­pa­nies the go-ahead to im­ple­ment tem­po­rary wage cuts to save jobs. The coun­cil had in March urged firms to re­duce non­wage costs first be­fore cut­ting salaries. But Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy has since en­tered a re­ces­sion, with the res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment rate hit­ting 4.5 per cent in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Ex­tend­ing the JSS in­def­i­nitely will de­plete state cof­fers. Funds should in­stead be cal­i­brated so that sec­tors which need the most help will con­tinue to get it. At the same time, it will be in­creas­ingly harder to prop up weaker com­pa­nies. Whether they fold, and whether un­em­ploy­ment spikes sharply as a re­sult, de­pends on how quickly th­ese firms can trans­form or even pivot to a dif­fer­ent in­dus­try. The au­thor­i­ties will have to mon­i­tor closely any signs of dis­tress, such as in­dus­try and firm-level data on non-per­form­ing loans, busi­ness ces­sa­tion num­bers and ap­pli­ca­tions for loan mora­to­ri­ums, and fire sales of as­sets.</p>
    <p>De­spite all ef­forts, the re­al­ity is that some firms will have to down­size or close. With this, sup­port for jobs may need to shift to­wards sup­port for work­ers, es­pe­cially the lower-in­come, mid­dleaged ones, and those who are re­trenched. Many sug­ges­tions have been put forth and de­bated in Par­lia­ment, in­clud­ing re­dun­dancy in­sur­ance, a min­i­mum wage, and tem­po­rary uni­ver­sal ba­sic in­come. An­other op­tion is to fine-tune ex­ist­ing schemes, such as through higher Work­fare In­come Sup­ple­ment pay­outs, widen­ing the el­i­gi­bil­ity cri­te­ria for the Self-Em­ployed Per­son In­come Relief Scheme, or mak­ing the Jobs Growth In­cen­tive – whose wage sub­si­dies are dou­bled for lo­cal hires aged 40 and above – longer term in du­ra­tion. Hard de­ci­sions lie ahead in the com­ing months for many firms, but help is at hand for those that are vi­able.</p>
