    <p>“To­day, it’s be­yond the state-of-the-art and driver­less tech­nol­ogy to de­velop Level 5. This is not to say it will never hap­pen. But to­day, a more re­al­is­tic goal is to fo­cus on Level 4.”</p>
    <p>That re­fresh­ingly hon­est as­sess­ment was made by Mr Karl Iag­nemma, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Mo­tional – a newly re­branded joint ven­ture be­tween Hyundai Mo­tor and Ap­tiv (pre­vi­ously known as Nu­ton­omy) – in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Level 4 refers to au­ton­o­mous driv­ing which can be ap­plied in most sit­u­a­tions, while Level 5 (cur­rently the high­est level) refers to such driver­less cars be­ing able to op­er­ate in all real-world sit­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Most of the so-called robo-taxi or driver­less bus ser­vices you read about in places like Ari­zona and Shen­zhen are Level 4 ap­pli­ca­tions. Tesla’s Au­topi­lot (a mis­nomer, de­spite all the YouTube hype) is some­where be­tween Lev­els 3 and 4, at best. Hence, you should never send some­one off in a driver­less Tesla, un­less it is some­one you don’t like.</p>
    <p>Many au­to­mo­tive ex­ec­u­tives are still hope­ful that Level 5 ma­chines will be on the road one day. But ask them over a night­cap and they will con­fess that day is un­likely to be be­fore 2040.</p>
    <p>Like many other coun­tries, Sin­ga­pore is ea­gerly wait­ing for that day to ar­rive. Grab and Go­jek, for in­stance, will see a profit wind­fall when they can re­move the driver from the ride-hail­ing equa­tion. Bus op­er­a­tors will no longer have to worry about dis­grun­tled drivers who pe­ri­od­i­cally ask for bet­ter pay and ac­com­mo­da­tion.</p>
    <p>But in a time like this, when the pan­demic is caus­ing the worst un­em­ploy­ment sit­u­a­tion since the global fi­nan­cial melt­down caused by greedy bankers, we shouldn’t be yank­ing drivers from the wheel, should we?</p>
    <p>In fact, we should not rush to get driver­less ve­hi­cles on the road, pe­riod.</p>
    <p>One sim­ple rea­son would be that the tech is just not ma­ture enough. And it will not be any time soon.</p>
    <p>And even if Level 5 tech is ready, so what? Why should we spend bil­lions to ac­com­mo­date ve­hi­cles which at best, will be on a par with hu­man drivers?</p>
    <p>In my view, we should be aim­ing for a Level 6 or 7, with ro­bots which will be con­sis­tently and markedly bet­ter than the best hu­man drivers.</p>
    <p>I mean, would a farmer buy a trac­tor if it could do the work of only one buffalo? Or would a car com­pany in­vest in weld­ing ro­bots which are slower than hu­mans? Of course not.</p>
    <p>So, I say let the rocket sci­en­tists tin­ker with their driver­less cars in a far-flung in­dus­trial es­tate. But don’t buy any­thing they sell un­less it can nav­i­gate the Cen­tral Ex­press­way dur­ing the evening peak while fry­ing an egg.</p>
    <p>In other words, un­less a ma­chine can drive like a Lewis Hamil­ton who has un­der­gone chauf­feur train­ing, its propo­si­tion is weak. I reckon by Level 7, they should be able to. By then, traf­fic can flow at speeds of 150kmh or more – with­out an ac­ci­dent and with­out any pas­sen­ger ever get­ting sick.</p>
    <p>But if driver­less cars move like granny with­out her glasses, please spare me.</p>
    <p>Lesser ma­chines will lead to higher in­ef­fi­ciency. Our own ex­pe­ri­ence with driver­less trains tells us as much. Even though th­ese trains are quite novel, we have had to put hu­mans back on board on oc­ca­sions be­cause hu­mans can re­act to tech­ni­cal glitches bet­ter.</p>
    <p>So I say, let’s not rush into the au­ton­o­mous band­wagon, lest we end up with costly white ele­phants fu­ture gen­er­a­tions will keep pay­ing for.</p>
    <p>In­stead, let’s work to­wards more re­al­is­able (and cost-ef­fi­cient) out­comes to im­prove traf­fic, such as bet­ter road de­signs, smarter junc­tions and fairer, sharper con­ges­tion charg­ing sys­tems.</p>
