    <p>On Sun­day morn­ings, the pool at Queen­stown Swim­ming Com­plex ap­pears peace­ful and empty, but sport­ing magic is tak­ing place.</p>
    <p>Play­ers are zip­ping across a three-di­men­sional space, tack­ling and evad­ing op­po­nents with the aim of throw­ing a ball into a cir­cu­lar goal.</p>
    <p>Quid­ditch springs to mind but, be­fore you can say Harry Pot­ter, the breath­less game is ac­tu­ally a real-life round of un­der­wa­ter rugby.</p>
    <p>In place of a quaf­fle, ath­letes vie for a saline-filled ball that sinks un­der wa­ter. In­stead of brooms, par­tic­i­pants put on a wa­ter polo cap, free-div­ing mask, snorkel and fins to help them nav­i­gate against wa­ter re­sis­tance in mul­ti­ple di­rec­tions in a 3.5-5 me­tre-deep pool.</p>
    <p>While Stan­ley Ng, for­mer pres­i­dent of First Asian Team Un­der­wa­ter Rugby Sin­ga­pore (FATUWR), which runs the sport here, is quite happy with the com­par­i­son to the fic­tional game, the fra­ter­nity hopes to dis­pel some myths as they aim to grow the sport in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old lawyer said: “With all the gear, you don’t have to be a strong swim­mer to play.</p>
    <p>“Since the sport was first played by life­guards and divers in Ger­many in 1961, there has not been a sin­gle case of drown­ing.</p>
    <p>“More­over, there are so many pairs of eyes to look out for one an­other.</p>
    <p>“While in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tions are cat­e­gorised by gen­der, we usu­ally train all to­gether and our de­mo­graph­ics are al­most 50-50.</p>
    <p>“The sport is not all about brute strength, and play­ing un­der­wa­ter is a great equaliser be­cause no one can stay sub­merged for­ever and team­work is re­ally im­por­tant.”</p>
    <p>The or­gan­i­sa­tion’s sec­re­tary Livia Lim, a 28-year-old sup­ply chain man­ager who picked up the sport in May last year, added: “You also don’t need to be an ex­pert in hold­ing your breath to play.</p>
    <p>“With­out a pur­pose, peo­ple gen­er­ally lose con­trol of their breath­hold eas­ily. But when your aim is to help your team score and win, sub­con­sciously, you hold your breath longer.”</p>
    <p>She added that the sport caters to a wide age range, with “kids as young as eight and adults in their 50s hav­ing a go”.</p>
    <p>In any case, FATUWR has the nec­es­sary ex­per­tise within its ranks – in­clud­ing a na­tional un­der­wa­ter hockey player, a for­mer na­tional swim­mer, and a free diver – to teach new­com­ers var­i­ous tech­niques and men­tor them to the next level.</p>
    <p>Strat­egy also plays a part in the six-a-side game, which has two halves of 15 min­utes each.</p>
    <p>As play­ers even­tu­ally have to come up for air, teams do not usu­ally de­ploy ev­ery­one un­der­wa­ter. They have to con­sider the tim­ing, pros and cons of hav­ing more or fewer play­ers on the sur­face be­fore the even­tual switch with aird­e­prived team­mates.</p>
    <p>Com­pli­ance man­ager Khee Chia How in­tro­duced the sport to Sin­ga­pore and founded FATUWR in 2014 af­ter dis­cov­er­ing it dur­ing his univer­sity stud­ies in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Since then, the club, which comes un­der the Sin­ga­pore Un­der­wa­ter Fed­er­a­tion, has grown to 60 mem­bers and the lo­cal play­ing com­mu­nity is around 100.</p>
    <p>In 2015, FATUWR’s male and fe­male teams fin­ished third and sec­ond re­spec­tively in the Na­tion­als League at the Pan Pa­cific Cup in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>They also com­peted at the Cham­pi­ons Cup – equiv­a­lent to foot­ball’s Cham­pi­ons League – in Ger­many in 2018.</p>
    <p>MORE TEAM-ORI­ENTED THAN SWIM­MING</p>
    <p>In­com­ing FATUWR pres­i­dent Kok Kiat Han was a SEA Games gold medal­list with the men’s un­der­wa­ter hockey team in the Philip­pines last year, but is now more fo­cused on un­der­wa­ter rugby.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old cy­ber­se­cu­rity an­a­lyst, ex­plained: “I’m more adept with han­dling a ball than a stick, which is more com­plex.</p>
    <p>“There are also more per­spec­tives and an­gles to play with in un­der­wa­ter rugby, com­pared to push­ing a puck on the floor in un­der­wa­ter hockey.</p>
    <p>“I still en­joy both sports and they com­ple­ment each other well, and I al­ways en­cour­age play­ers to en­gage in more ac­tiv­i­ties to build their con­fi­dence un­der­wa­ter.”</p>
    <p>Thum Bing Ming, a for­mer na­tional swim­mer who won a 4x200m freestyle gold at the 2007 SEA Games, is an­other con­vert.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing spe­cial­ist said: “Swim­ming can be a lonely sport, where we just go up and down a lane, so I was look­ing for some­thing more team-ori­ented while still be­ing able to swim.</p>
    <p>“Un­der­wa­ter rugby hits the spot for me be­cause its 3D na­ture chal­lenges play­ers to think in ways we nor­mally wouldn’t, and the com­mu­nity is in­cred­i­bly close-knit and en­cour­ag­ing.”</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic forced the clo­sure of pub­lic pools from April to June, and cur­rent re­stric­tions mean FATUWR, which re­sumed ses­sions in July, can train and play only three-a-side games in spe­cific ar­eas of the pool when they train at Queen­stown on Sun­days and at a school on Tues­days.</p>
    <p>Be­sides aim­ing to pop­u­larise the sport here, FATUWR also set its sights fur­ther afield and hopes Sin­ga­pore can even­tu­ally cap­ture the golden snitch in the form of a SEA Games gold medal as early as 2025.</p>
    <p>Un­der­wa­ter rugby hits the spot for me be­cause its 3D na­ture chal­lenges play­ers to think in ways we nor­mally wouldn’t, and the com­mu­nity is in­cred­i­bly close-knit and en­cour­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>DREAM­ING OF SEA GAMES GLORY</p>
    <p>Ng said: “We hope air travel bub­bles can be es­tab­lished soon, so that we can go on ex­change pro­grammes and in­tro­duce the sport to the re­gion.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing able to travel will also help us to im­prove when we go for over­seas com­pe­ti­tions and bring in for­eign ex­perts from Europe like we have done in the past.”</p>
    <p>Kok added: “Learn­ing from the un­der­wa­ter hockey ex­pe­ri­ence, if we want to get to the SEA Games, we need the host coun­try to play and be pro­fi­cient, and at least five coun­tries to have a na­tional team to par­tic­i­pate.</p>
    <p>“It is ev­ery ath­lete’s dream to rep­re­sent Sin­ga­pore and win a medal for the na­tion.</p>
    <p>“We will try our best to spread our love for un­der­wa­ter rugby in the re­gion and get it on the SEA Games pro­gramme.”</p>
