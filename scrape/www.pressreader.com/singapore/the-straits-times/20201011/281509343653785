    <p>From do­ing time to do­ing good − Anil David left a life of crime to set up a so­cial en­ter­prise</p>
    <p>For a cou­ple of years now, Mr Anil David has been pray­ing for a meaty govern­ment con­tract be­cause it would be a ring­ing en­dorse­ment of his so­cial en­ter­prise Agape Con­nect­ing Peo­ple – a con­tact cen­tre founded by an ex-of­fender and which em­ploys other ex-of­fend­ers, sin­gle moth­ers and peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 made that dream come true.</p>
    <p>In April this year, the com­pany was given the big job of man­ning the Na­tional Care Hot­line, set up by the Govern­ment to of­fer psy­cho­log­i­cal aid and emo­tional sup­port for those who need it dur­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>For the past six months, Agape staff mem­bers have been the “first level triage” for dis­tressed call­ers, help­ing to calm them down be­fore chan­nelling their calls to the hot­line’s trained pro­fes­sion­als, in­clud­ing psy­chol­o­gists, coun­sel­lors and so­cial work­ers.</p>
    <p>“It was the break­through I have been pray­ing for. It af­firms my be­lief that work is a plat­form where ex-of­fend­ers can re­deem, and other dis­ad­van­taged peo­ple can prove, them­selves,” says Mr Anil.</p>
    <p>It took a while be­fore the 52-yearold – who was thrown be­hind bars on three oc­ca­sions for fraud and crim­i­nal breach of trust – man­aged to prove and re­deem him­self.</p>
    <p>The call cen­tre he started with his wife in 2012 to­day em­ploys nearly 150 staff. Half are serv­ing time in prison and the rest are ex-of­fend­ers, se­nior cit­i­zens and other “dis­ad­van­taged peo­ple want­ing a sec­ond chance in life”.</p>
    <p>No longer just a call cen­tre, the multi-chan­nel con­tact cen­tre also of­fers a full suite of ser­vices in­clud­ing call han­dling, e-mail mar­ket­ing, We­bchat in­ter­ac­tion and so­cial me­dia man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Be­sides an of­fice in Tai Seng Av­enue, Agape also runs a call cen­tre in the women’s prison in Changi. With a grant from the DBS Foun­da­tion last year, it is also in the process of con­vert­ing another call cen­tre in the men’s prison into a train­ing academy with four class­rooms, each of which can ac­com­mo­date 20 trainees.</p>
    <p>The out­fit’s clar­ion call of “trans­form­ing lives and re­build­ing fam­i­lies” has res­onated with many cor­po­ra­tions and its clients in­clude in­sur­ance com­pa­nies, tel­cos and govern­ment agen­cies.</p>
    <p>It has also won a slew of awards, in­clud­ing The Most Im­pact­ful So­cial En­ter­prise (2016), given out by the Sin­ga­pore Ven­ture Cap­i­tal & Pri­vate Eq­uity As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sion­als, too, have come on board to j oin its so­cial mis­sion. Mr Joseph See, for in­stance, left his job as head of ac­qui­si­tion and re­ten­tion at StarHub to be­come Agape’s chief ex­ec­u­tive two years ago. StarHub was one of Agape’s first ma­jor clients.</p>
    <p>“I guess it’s a call­ing, some­thing I felt I needed to do. Anil wanted to im­pact more peo­ple and couldn’t do it alone. I felt he needed help and my for­mer bosses gave me their bless­ings,” says Mr See, who brings with him more than two decades of lead­er­ship ex­pe­ri­ence in the con­tact cen­tre in­dus­try across banks and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Although it did not re­veal fig­ures, Agape’s an­nual rev­enue has gone up six times since its in­cep­tion.</p>
    <p>“We have to be prof­itable to be sus­tain­able, but, more im­por­tantly, it is about the num­ber of lives we have im­pacted,” says Mr Anil, adding that Agape has turned around the lives of nearly 600 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The third of six chil­dren of a driver and a house­wife, he had a happy enough child­hood un­til it was sul­lied by a late un­cle who sex­u­ally mo­lested him – pe­ri­od­i­cally over a year – when he was eight.</p>
    <p>The episode scarred him, plagu­ing him with self doubt, low self­es­teem and trust is­sues. The for­mer stu­dent of St An­drew’s Sec­ondary School flunked his O lev­els, pass­ing only English.</p>
    <p>His first proper job, af­ter com­plet­ing na­tional ser­vice, was sell­ing in­sur­ance. “I did well be­cause of my cre­ative ap­proach,” he says.</p>
    <p>Break­ing into a grin, he re­calls how he once came across pages of obit­u­ar­ies for a Chi­nese towkay in the news­pa­pers.</p>
    <p>“It was one of those three-day wakes. Although I didn’t know him, I went to the wake, rolled up my sleeves and helped serve drinks. His son came up to me and asked who I was and I said: ‘Your dad gave me very good ad­vice’,” he says. “One month later, the son be­came my in­sur­ance client.”</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, he did not par­lay his re­source­ful­ness and gift of the gab to get ahead le­git­i­mately.</p>
    <p>Im­pa­tient for the good things in life – fast cars and de­signer la­bels – he took short­cuts, by il­le­gally dip­ping into his clients’ funds.</p>
    <p>Over eight months, he si­phoned nearly $100,000, which he splurged on a racy life­style.</p>
    <p>“Sin is de­li­cious, like a juicy mango. But too much of it will give you di­a­betes,” says Mr Anil, whose book about his life, The Long­est Short­cut, is now avail­able in Ki­noku­niya and on­line book­store Goguru.</p>
    <p>In 1995, when he was 27 and mar­ried, he was caught and sen­tenced to five years in jail. He ended up in jail two more times for crim­i­nal breach of trust.</p>
    <p>“My last prison sen­tence in 2004 was for eight years. I was re­ally down, I felt I had come to the end of the road. My wife and two daugh­ters wanted to have noth­ing to do with me,” says Mr Anil, whose chil­dren are now 18 and 25.</p>
    <p>His life took a dif­fer­ent turn when he was as­signed to work in a call cen­tre in the prison in 2006. Hav­ing found faith, he told him­self he had to re­build his life and ap­ply him­self so he could pick up new skills.</p>
    <p>The chief ex­ec­u­tive run­ning the call cen­tre no­ticed he was good at sell­ing.</p>
    <p>“He would bring me books and talk to me. He even promised me a job when I was re­leased,” says Mr Anil, who was later made team leader and then trainer.</p>
    <p>The idea of start­ing a busi­ness which could help re­form ex-of­fend­ers started per­co­lat­ing in his head.</p>
    <p>“The CEO gave me time and at­ten­tion. I told my­self if I had a busi­ness model which gave time and at­ten­tion to ex-of­fend­ers, they could be re­ha­bil­i­tated.”</p>
    <p>Hope came i n other ways. Although scep­ti­cal it would help mend his re­la­tion­ship with his es­tranged fam­ily, he wrote his el­der daugh­ter a let­ter through the Yel­low Rib­bon Project, an ini­tia­tive to en­cour­age ac­cep­tance of ex-of­fend­ers and give them a sec­ond chance in life. She replied.</p>
    <p>“I chose the name Agape be­cause it means un­con­di­tional love. I’m here be­cause of the un­con­di­tional love of my wife and daugh­ters,” he says.</p>
    <p>As promised, he was given a job at a call cen­tre upon his re­lease in 2011. To sup­ple­ment his in­come, he made calls for in­sur­ance agents, earn­ing $50 each time he got them an ap­point­ment.</p>
    <p>With his sav­ings and money his wife raised from pawn­ing her jew­ellery, he started Agape a year later. The chief ex­ec­u­tive who helped him also wrote him a $20,000 cheque – re­paid a year later – to start the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The go­ing was tough in the be­gin­ning. He pulled 18-hour days, of­ten sur­viv­ing on cup noo­dles and pre­par­ing all the ma­te­ri­als him­self. But his dogged­ness to help oth­ers was so af­fect­ing he was of­fered the chance to set up a call cen­tre in the prison.</p>
    <p>Rais­ing the funds to do so proved an up­hill task be­cause his prison record made him “un­bank­able” – un­til Mr Ma­son Tan and Mr Kim Tan – both heads of in­vest­ment firms – stepped in with an in­vest­ment of nearly $500,000.</p>
    <p>“They told me: ‘If you ever be­come all for profit, we will pull out all our in­vest­ments,” says Mr Anil.</p>
    <p>He dreams of im­pact­ing more lives. “Mine was a story of fail­ure af­ter fail­ure af­ter fail­ure. Yet at 42, I de­cided to change be­cause I was given a sec­ond chance. Change is pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>If you had to give just one rea­son why you com­mit­ted those crimes, what would it be?</p>
    <p>I grew up in an era when young peo­ple my age craved ma­te­rial things like the 5Cs – cash, condo, car, credit card and coun­try club mem­ber­ship. I, too, wanted them, but I made wrong choices to get them. I got them, but they de­stroyed my life.</p>
    <p>Com­plete this sen­tence: The prison is not a place you want to end up in be­cause...</p>
    <p>It takes away a part of your soul that you can never get back. I was not there to watch the kids grow, I missed out on joy­ous cel­e­bra­tions like grad­u­a­tions. And I was not there when my sis­ter passed away. These are re­grets I will al­ways carry.</p>
    <p>Do you think many peo­ple pay lip ser­vice to the phrase “sec­ond chances” and that Sin­ga­pore still has a long way to go be­fore peo­ple put their money where their mouth is?</p>
    <p>I have both good and bad ex­pe­ri­ences. But I firmly be­lieve that if we con­tinue to show re­silience and com­mit­ment, peo­ple will come around. It takes time, but the re­cep­tion to Agape has been very pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Why was start­ing Agape and help­ing ex-of­fend­ers so im­por­tant to you?</p>
    <p>I wanted to do some­thing mean­ing­ful and with a pur­pose be­cause I wanted my daugh­ters to be proud of me. I have spent so much time on the dark side.</p>
    <p>I knew I could help oth­ers change be­cause I went through the change my­self. I un­der­stand fail­ings and de­struc­tive be­hav­iour, and can con­nect with those who are strug­gling with these.</p>
    <p>When you started Agape, did you think it would get to where it is to­day?</p>
    <p>I never fath­omed that it would grow to be where it is now. It sur­prises me, but I know my God, from whom I get strength, leads me in this pur­suit.</p>
    <p>What are the three things about Agape you are proud­est of?</p>
    <p>My only friend since young, in­vestor spe­cial­ist Bhart Sheri, was once in­ter­ro­gated be­cause of our close re­la­tion­ship. I brought him trou­ble, but he has not only for­given me, but also in­vested in my busi­ness be­cause he stands with me and be­lieves in my dreams.</p>
    <p>I’m proud of my rec­on­cil­i­a­tion with my fam­ily, who have stood by me all these years.</p>
    <p>And I’m proud of the op­por­tu­nity to walk along­side ex-of­fend­ers, peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties and other folks in chal­leng­ing sit­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Do you ever feel over­whelmed and out-of-depth be­cause of Agape’s growth? How do you han­dle it?</p>
    <p>I have a good team that car­ries the vi­sion with me and I am not alone. My team makes me de­ter­mined to dream big­ger. Alone, I can only do so lit­tle. It takes a vil­lage.</p>
    <p>What do you say to cyn­ics who say: A leop­ard never changes its spots?</p>
    <p>A leop­ard with dreams and mea­sur­able goals in the com­pany of good men can change, but a leop­ard who per­sists in keep­ing bad com­pany will find it hard.</p>
    <p>What does pur­pose mean to you?</p>
    <p>Ded­i­cat­ing my­self to a cause be­yond my­self. It fu­els my mo­ti­va­tion in life, giv­ing my life mean­ing and di­rec­tion, in­spir­ing me to make a sig­nif­i­cant con­tri­bu­tion to the world.</p>
