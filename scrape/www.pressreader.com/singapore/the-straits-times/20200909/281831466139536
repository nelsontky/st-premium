    <p>BANGKOK • Thai­land’s plan to re­open its trop­i­cal is­land of Phuket to for­eign visi­tors next month has hit a speed bump with the end of a 100-day streak of no lo­cal com­mu­nity coro­n­avirus trans­mis­sion in the na­tion last week.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment is ready, but there are still con­cerns from some groups that the re­open­ing will lead to in­fec­tions,” said Deputy Premier and Health Min­is­ter Anutin Charn­vi­rakul yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“It’s been nine months now. We have to learn to fight and live with the pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>The re­open­ing plan faced more scru­tiny af­ter of­fi­cials con­firmed the first lo­cal case since May 26 of a 37-year-old male in­mate in a Bangkok prison with no re­cent his­tory of trav­el­ling abroad.</p>
    <p>Re­open­ing to tourists has seen a resur­gence of cases in some places like the Caribbean is­land of Aruba, and gov­ern­ments fear strik­ing the wrong bal­ance be­tween pub­lic health and eco­nomic help.</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s hos­pi­tal­ity and tourism sec­tors are count­ing on the re­turn of overseas visi­tors, who con­trib­uted to two-thirds of tourism in­come be­fore the pan­demic, to re­verse a slump in busi­ness and save mil­lions of jobs.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment and busi­nesses are weigh­ing the cost be­tween curb­ing in­fec­tion risks and lim­it­ing dam­age to t he econ­omy, which is on track for a record con­trac­tion of 8.5 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>“Thai­land’s fail­ure to re­launch overseas tourism cre­ates a dan­ger­ously per­ilous sce­nario for Phuket’s hos­pi­tal­ity in­dus­try,” Mr Bill Bar­nett, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor at con­sult­ing firm C9 Hotel­works, said.</p>
    <p>The Thai gov­ern­ment has been try­ing to pro­mote do­mes­tic tourism with a cam­paign to foot 40 per cent of trav­ellers’ ho­tel bills, but lo­cal spend­ing alone can­not com­pen­sate for a loss of earn­ings from for­eign­ers.</p>
