    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • Mil­wau­kee Bucks head coach Mike Bu­den­holzer and Ok­la­homa City Thun­der coun­ter­part Billy Dono­van were named as joint win­ners of the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball Coaches As­so­ci­a­tion (NBCA) Coach of the Year award on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>They shared the award af­ter vot­ing which saw Toronto Rap­tors head coach Nick Nurse, who led the Cana­dian team to their first cham­pi­onship ti­tle last year, just miss out on a share of the hon­our.</p>
    <p>Nurse, 53, polled just one vote fewer than Bu­den­holzer, 50, and Dono­van, 55.</p>
    <p>The award is de­cided each year based on votes by the NBA’s 30 head coaches, with each coach vot­ing for a sin­gle in­di­vid­ual. Vot­ing this year was based on games played up to March 11, when the sea­son went into shut­down be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Dal­las Mav­er­icks head coach and NBCA pres­i­dent Rick Carlisle said Bu­den­holzer had earned the award for a sec­ond straight sea­son af­ter help­ing league-lead­ing Mil­wau­kee (54-13) com­pile the best record in the NBA up un­til the sus­pen­sion. Dono­van was also recog­nised af­ter lead­ing his team to the NBA play-offs in each of his first five sea­sons.</p>
    <p>Carlisle added: “To win the vote of our peers makes the Michael H. Gold­berg NBCA Coach of the Year Award one of the most mean­ing­ful in all of pro sports.”</p>
    <p>Bu­den­holzer said: “As Michael was a ter­rific ad­vo­cate for all of us, may we use our plat­form to raise aware­ness and speak out on the need for so­cial jus­tice, equal­ity and in­clu­sive­ness in our so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>Dono­van joins NBA coach­ing gi­ants Don Nel­son, Pat Ri­ley and Gregg Popovich as the only three­time win­ners of the hon­our.</p>
    <p>Dono­van said: “In­di­vid­ual hon­ours to me have al­ways been a re­flec­tion of good team dy­nam­ics, and I’m proud of the col­lec­tive work that our play­ers, coach­ing staff and the en­tire or­gan­i­sa­tion has put in this sea­son.”</p>
    <p>Sev­eral other coaches re­ceived votes in­clud­ing Tay­lor Jenk­ins (Griz­zlies), Nate McMil­lan (Pac­ers), Erik Spoel­stra (Heat), Brad Stevens (Celtics) and Frank Vo­gel (Lak­ers).</p>
    <p>The league re­sumed last week, with the re­main­der of the sea­son to be played at Dis­ney World with­out fans.</p>
