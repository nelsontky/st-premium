    <p>Den­ver re­cov­ered from a 3-1 deficit to force Game 7 by ty­ing the se­ries against Los An­ge­les at 3-3. They will at­tempt to be­come the first team to win for the sec­ond time after fall­ing be­hind 3-1, hav­ing done so against Utah in the first round.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>The Los An­ge­les Clip­pers are find­ing Den­ver a hard nugget to swal­low right now, but the truth is, the re­silient Nuggets hardly choke even when they are trail­ing by a huge margin.</p>
    <p>Den­ver’s Nikola Jo­kic had game­highs of 34 points, 14 re­bounds and seven as­sists on Sun­day, pow­er­ing the Nuggets to a 111-98 win over the Clip­pers to level their Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) Western Con­fer­ence semi-fi­nal se­ries.</p>
    <p>The Nuggets, who also had 21 points from Ja­mal Mur­ray and Gary Har­ris, re­cov­ered from a 19-point deficit in the third quar­ter to match Los An­ge­les at 3-3, set­ting up a win­ner-take-all Game 7 to­day.</p>
    <p>“We don’t have pres­sure,” Jo­kic said. “All the pres­sure is on them. We have to play at a high level and give our best. To us, it’s just an­other Game 7. We’re go­ing to go out there and play.”</p>
    <p>It was the fourth con­sec­u­tive play-off se­ries over two seasons in which the Nuggets have faced a seventh game. They are 5-0 in elim­i­na­tion games and have ral­lied from 16-point or worse deficits in the past three such games.</p>
    <p>“The ef­fort was amaz­ing,” Jo­kic added. “We were down 16 last time, down 16 to Utah – we don’t want it but maybe we like it. We’re good at it. The whole team played well. It was an amaz­ing game for us.”</p>
    <p>The 2.13m Ser­bian cen­tre hit 13 of 22 shots, 4-of-6 from three-point range and 4-of-5 from the freethrow line.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s de­fence,” he said. “When we get a cou­ple of stops, we are fly­ing and the ball is mov­ing. When we start run­ning the of­fence, we’re a re­ally good team.”</p>
    <p>The Clip­pers, who have squan­dered a 3-1 se­ries edge, have never reached a Con­fer­ence Finals in their 50-year his­tory and they missed 10 shots in a row in the third pe­riod dur­ing a 17-0 Nuggets run.</p>
    <p>“They came down and scored or got fouled in the third quar­ter and we couldn’t buy a bas­ket,” Clip­pers for­ward and Finals Most Valu­able Player Kawhi Leonard said.</p>
    <p>“We’ve just got to leave it all out on the floor, com­mu­ni­cate and play hard on the de­fen­sive end.”</p>
    <p>For­ward Paul Ge­orge scored 33 points and Leonard added 25 to lead the Clip­pers, who were outscored 64-35 in the sec­ond half.</p>
    <p>“It was beau­ti­ful play­ing,” their coach Doc Rivers said. “Then we stopped mov­ing the ball, stopped play­ing. That’s what let them get back in the game.</p>
    <p>“We have the right for­mula. We just lost it. We lost our pace.”</p>
    <p>The Nuggets be­came the first team since the 1970 Los An­ge­les Lak­ers to force mul­ti­ple Game 7s in the same play-off run.</p>
    <p>No team have ever re­cov­ered from a 3-1 deficit twice in the same play-off run, but Den­ver could be the first, fol­low­ing their 4-3 win over the Utah Jazz in the first round.</p>
    <p>“I’m run­ning out of su­perla­tives to say about our team. I love our team. I love our tough­ness,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said.</p>
    <p>“We were down 16 at half-time. We weren’t down on our­selves. We knew what we were go­ing to have to go through.</p>
    <p>“The ques­tion was how are we go­ing to get out of it. One of the best third quar­ters I can re­mem­ber in my five years.”</p>
    <p>Like the Clip­pers, the Nuggets have never won a cham­pi­onship and have reached the Western Con­fer­ence Finals only three times pre­vi­ously, the last com­ing in 2009.</p>
    <p>So Malone has no idea what gives his team the abil­ity to climb out of deep deficits other than “in­ner be­lief”.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve we have what it takes to win a cham­pi­onship,” he said. “But we have a lot of work to do.”</p>
