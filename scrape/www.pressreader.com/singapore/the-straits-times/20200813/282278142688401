    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tain’s econ­omy shrank by a record 20.4 per cent be­tween April and June, when the coro­n­avirus lock­down was tight­est, the l argest con­trac­tion re­ported by any ma­jor econ­omy so far, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial fig­ures pub­lished yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The data also showed that the world’s sixth-big­gest econ­omy en­tered a re­ces­sion as it shrank for a sec­ond quar­ter in a row.</p>
    <p>It is Bri­tain’s first re­ces­sion since the 2008 fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The grim eco­nomic news comes de­spite un­prece­dented govern­ment in­ter­ven­tions, in­clud­ing spend­ing tens of bil­lions of pounds on job sup­port schemes in a bid to avoid mass lay­offs.</p>
    <p>The coun­try – which al­ready has the high­est death toll in Europe from the virus – ap­pears to be pay­ing a heav­ier price for lock­ing down later than its con­ti­nen­tal neigh­bours ear­lier in the year.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish econ­omy also re­lies more heav­ily on the hard-hit ser­vice sec­tor than other Euro­pean na­tions.</p>
    <p>There were signs of a re­cov­ery in the month of June alone when gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) grew by 8.7 per cent from May, the Of­fice for Na­tional Statis­tics said.</p>
    <p>That was just above economists’ av­er­age ex­pec­ta­tion in a Reuters poll for an 8 per cent rise. Growth in May was re­vised up too.</p>
    <p>“The re­ces­sion brought on by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has led to the big­gest fall in quar­terly GDP on record,” Mr Jonathan Athow of the Of­fice for Na­tional Statis­tics said.</p>
    <p>“The econ­omy be­gan to bounce back in June... De­spite this, GDP in June still re­mains a sixth be­low its level in Fe­bru­ary, be­fore the virus struck.”</p>
    <p>Last week, the Bank of Eng­land fore­cast it would take un­til the fi­nal quar­ter of next year for the econ­omy to re­gain its pre­vi­ous size, and warned that un­em­ploy­ment was likely to rise sharply.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond-quar­ter slump in GDP was al­most ex­actly in line with economists’ av­er­age ex­pec­ta­tion in a Reuters poll, and ex­ceeded the 12.1 per cent drop in the euro zone and the 9.5 per cent quar­ter-on-quar­ter fall in the</p>
    <p>United States.</p>
    <p>“To­day’s fig­ures con­firm that hard times are here,” Fi­nance Min­is­ter Rishi Su­nak said. “Hun­dreds of thou­sands of peo­ple have al­ready lost their jobs, and sadly in the com­ing months many more will.”</p>
    <p>The level of out­put in June was 16.8 per cent be­low its level a year ear­lier, com­pared with a 23.3 per cent fall for May.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish GDP shrank by 2.2 per cent in the first quar­ter of the year, re­flect­ing the lock­down that started on March 24.</p>
    <p>The re­ces­sion is al­ready wreak­ing havoc, with the Of­fice for Na­tional Statis­tics data re­leased on Mon­day show­ing around 730,000 United King­dom work­ers have been re­moved from the pay­rolls of Bri­tish com­pa­nies since March.</p>
    <p>An­nounce­ments of job cuts have be­come a daily oc­cur­rence, with firms ex­pected to pick up the pace of lay­offs as the govern­ment’s key em­ploy­ment sup­port scheme ends in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>The un­em­ploy­ment rate is ex­pected to soar in the months ahead, with mil­lions set to turn to govern­ment ben­e­fit pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>“What­ever the num­bers are, and they won’t be pretty, the more im­por­tant ques­tion is how quickly the UK econ­omy can bounce back,” said Mr Michael Hew­son, an an­a­lyst at CMC Mar­kets. “We have seen some progress on that.”</p>
