    <p>I read with con­cern about Mr Goh Chok Tong hav­ing un­der­gone two med­i­cal pro­ce­dures in the last few weeks and also the news that in the up­com­ing weeks, he will un­dergo 20 ses­sions of ra­dio­ther­apy (ESM Goh to un­dergo ra­dio­ther­apy af­ter re­moval of lump, Dec 19).</p>
    <p>For a 79-year-old, his fight­ing spirit and cheer­ful dis­po­si­tion in the face of these med­i­cal is­sues are ad­mirable. But it is, nonethe­less, cer­tainly a stress­ful pe­riod for him.</p>
    <p>I wish him good health and hope that with the best med­i­cal care to be ac­corded to him in the next few weeks, he will get to see the “clear blue sky” be­fore Chi­nese New Year, as he wished.</p>
    <p>On Face­book, he ad­vised all to go for reg­u­lar health screen­ings, thereby show­ing his con­cern for Sin­ga­pore­ans. De­spite his present health con­di­tion, he looks beyond his own health is­sues to con­sider our well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>His fa­therly de­meanour, as well as his fre­quent ad­vice to Sin­ga­pore­ans on var­i­ous mat­ters in his pre­vi­ous role of se­nior min­is­ter, has al­ways en­deared him to me.</p>
    <p>I will never for­get how once, in the early 1980s, at the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs head­quar­ters at Phoenix Park where I worked for two years, I came face to face with him along a cor­ri­dor and he smiled and ac­knowl­edged me. I was part of the of­fice staff then. He was then a Cabi­net min­is­ter, but he showed no pompous­ness or aloof­ness, de­spite his com­mand­ing stature.</p>
    <p>I wish him good health for many more years to come.</p>
    <p>May he have many more years to en­joy his re­tire­ment.</p>
