    <p>NEW YORK • A fed­eral judge said on Thurs­day that he would make an im­por­tant pro­ce­dural rul­ing in favour of a group of mixed mar­tial arts ex­po­nents who are su­ing the Ul­ti­mate Fighting Cham­pi­onship (UFC), ac­cus­ing it of abus­ing mo­nop­oly power to sup­press fighter pay.</p>
    <p>The law­suit, which will be granted class ac­tion sta­tus on Mon­day, could even­tu­ally cost the UFC bil­lions of dol­lars, fun­da­men­tally al­ter the world of MMA and es­tab­lish new an­titrust case law.</p>
    <p>The law­suit was filed against the UFC’s par­ent com­pany, Zuffa, in 2014 by Viet­nam-born Amer­i­can Cung Le and a hand­ful of other for­mer UFC fight­ers.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing by Judge Richard Boul­ware means ev­ery fighter who com­peted in the UFC be­tween late 2010 and 2017 – around 1,200 – will be a part of the law­suit un­less they opt out.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in a small vic­tory for the UFC, Boul­ware de­clined to al­low a smaller part of the law­suit to go for­ward, choos­ing not to grant class ac­tion sta­tus to the fight­ers’ claims the UFC also sup­pressed earn­ings from their image rights.</p>
    <p>If the plain­tiffs suc­ceed, ex­perts es­ti­mated to­tal dam­ages may be in the range of US$2.5 bil­lion to US$5 bil­lion (S$6.7 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>At an ev­i­den­tiary hear­ing i n 2018, one ex­pert for the plain­tiffs said the fight­ers were de­prived of US$1.6 bil­lion in pay be­cause MMA lacks a com­pet­i­tive labour mar­ket, and in an­titrust cases, dam­ages are tre­bled.</p>
    <p>That fig­ure was de­ter­mined by a for­mula com­par­ing the UFC, where less than 20 per cent of to­tal rev­enue has his­tor­i­cally been paid to fight­ers, to ma­jor team sports like the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion and Na­tional Foot­ball League, where play­ers re­ceive about 50 per cent of to­tal rev­enue.</p>
    <p>The fight­ers are also seek­ing struc­tural reme­dies, like a ban on long-term con­tracts, that could make it eas­ier for po­ten­tial chal­lengers to the UFC to arise.</p>
    <p>While there are other pro­fes­sional MMA or­gan­i­sa­tions, like Bel­la­tor and One Cham­pi­onship, the UFC’s dom­i­nance has been undis­puted since it bought over and folded at least five com­peti­tors be­gin­ning in 2006.</p>
    <p>Con­trol­ling fighter pay is key to the UFC’s busi­ness. It was bought in 2016 by En­deavor, a Hol­ly­wood-based en­ter­tain­ment, sports and me­dia con­glom­er­ate backed by pri­vate eq­uity money, for US$4 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>At a hear­ing i n Septem­ber, lawyers for the UFC in­di­cated they would ap­peal against any rul­ing grant­ing class ac­tion cer­ti­fi­ca­tion. The UFC has also filed a mo­tion for sum­mary judg­ment that the judge must rule on, essen­tially ar­gu­ing that the fight­ers have no case and that the suit should be thrown out.</p>
    <p>The case is one of the most sig­nif­i­cant ef­forts to de­ploy cen­tury-old an­titrust law to at­tack “monop­sony” power, the lever­age com­pa­nies can wield by cut­ting off work­ers’ abil­ity to find work else­where, but is ex­pected to still take years to re­solve un­less there is a set­tle­ment.</p>
