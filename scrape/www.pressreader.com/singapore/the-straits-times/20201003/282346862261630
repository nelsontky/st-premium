    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has hit com­pa­nies hard, send­ing rev­enue crash­ing, af­fect­ing business mod­els and putting in­ter­na­tion­al­i­sa­tion plans on hold, a sur­vey out yes­ter­day showed.</p>
    <p>The an­nual sur­vey by the Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Cham­ber of Com­merce and In­dus­try (SCCCI) polled around 1,000 firms – most were small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs), with 75 per cent com­ing from the ser­vice in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>It found that 80 per cent of re­spon­dents said they have ex­pe­ri­enced a drop in rev­enue this year, al­most dou­ble the per­cent­age from last year.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey also noted that 51 per cent of firms felt that the pan­demic has had a ma­jor im­pact on their business model, es­pe­cially those in sec­tors such as con­struc­tion, re­tail, health and so­cial ser­vices, food and bev­er­age ser­vices, and tourism and ho­tels.</p>
    <p>The top chal­lenge many firms faced was main­tain­ing cash flow and fi­nanc­ing, as well as deal­ing with ris­ing business costs.</p>
    <p>Many noted that they were not gen­er­at­ing enough cash to meet ex­penses and had con­cerns over slower pay­ments from cus­tomers or debtors.</p>
    <p>The cri­sis has spurred 56 per cent of firms polled to speed up dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion ef­forts, while 62 per cent chased new rev­enue sources.</p>
    <p>But they faced chal­lenges such as a lack of in­ter­nal ex­per­tise and the high cost of go­ing dig­i­tal.</p>
    <p>More­over, while firms were will­ing to em­brace new tech­no­log­i­cal so­lu­tions, they were not gen­er­at­ing sig­nif­i­cant rev­enue from on­line sources.</p>
    <p>The poll – con­ducted from June 11 to Aug 6 – noted that over 50 per cent of firms did not see ap­pli­ca­ble rev­enue from on­line streams, while 20 per cent said these meth­ods brought them less than 10 per cent of to­tal turnover.</p>
    <p>Firms in sec­tors such as food and bev­er­age ser­vices, food man­u­fac­tur­ing, health and so­cial ser­vices, tourism and ho­tels, education and re­tail trade did bet­ter on­line.</p>
    <p>De­spite these chal­lenges, most firms said they were re­tain­ing staff.</p>
    <p>But 8 per cent had to lay off work­ers due to the pan­demic. Some also had to cut salaries, while nearly 30 per cent said they had to re­duce em­ployee work­ing hours.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has stalled in­ter­na­tion­al­i­sa­tion plans: Only about 50 per cent of re­spon­dents said they wanted to ven­ture overseas – a big de­crease from the 65 per cent in 2018 and the 60 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>Those that were still keen on go­ing abroad cited Malaysia, China and Viet­nam as the top des­ti­na­tions.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, close to 60 per cent of firms felt that they needed one to two years to re­cover their business to pre-pan­demic lev­els.</p>
    <p>The SCCCI rec­om­mended that the Gov­ern­ment put in place mea­sures such as ex­panded test­ing and con­tact trac­ing so the econ­omy can re­open more quickly.</p>
    <p>Bi­lat­eral pro­to­cols could also be sped up, such as short­ened quar­an­tine pe­ri­ods, so that business travel can be sup­ported.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment could also pro­vide more sup­port for SMEs to man­age the costs of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, while help­ing firms that are try­ing to hire mid-ca­reer and ma­ture work­ers, it added.</p>
