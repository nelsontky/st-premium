    <p>When the pan­demic hit, the main prob­lem for tele­vi­sion pro­duc­tions was how you could pos­si­bly make shows in these times.</p>
    <p>The next and re­lated prob­lem was how you could pos­si­bly make shows about these times.</p>
    <p>This month, t wo se­ries test whether you can make com­pelling tele­vi­sion in and about a deadly global cri­sis while it is still go­ing on, and whether any­one wants to see that right now.</p>
    <p>Both Con­nect­ing..., on NBC, and So­cial Dis­tance, ar­riv­ing to­day on Net­flix, are come­dies.</p>
    <p>Maybe it makes sense: Just as M*A*S*H (1972 to 1983) made dark com­edy of the Korean War dur­ing the Viet­nam War, the pro­duc­ers of these se­ries must sense that ask­ing peo­ple to es­cape a dire re­al­ity with more of that re­al­ity would be a tough sell with­out promis­ing them at least the­o­ret­i­cal laughs.</p>
    <p>Some are more the­o­ret­i­cal than oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The well-mean­ing but bland Con­nect­ing... does not feel like an or­ganic, fleshed-out story so much as a pan­demic sea­son of an ex­ist­ing, generic friends-hang­ing-out sit­com whose pre­vi­ous sea­sons you haven’t seen.</p>
    <p>The com­edy cen­tres on a group of friends in Los An­ge­les, now re­duced to video chat­ting in be­tween wait­ing for de­liv­er­ies and doom­scrolling the news.</p>
    <p>Many of the ma­jor friend-com­edy food groups are rep­re­sented, with a pan­demic spin on each sit­u­a­tion and neu­ro­sis.</p>
    <p>The high-strung Pradeep (Parvesh Cheena) is be­ing driven stir-crazy by his young kids. Gar­ret and Michelle (Keith Pow­ell and Jill Knox) guiltily find that their mar­riage is thriv­ing as the world falls apart. And pos­si­bly-morethan-friends An­nie (Ot­mara Mar­rero) and Ben (Preacher Law­son) find their will-they-won’t-they flir­ta­tion stymied by the they-can’t re­al­ity of quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>The sit­com un­folds chrono­log­i­cally from the start of shel­ter-in­place or­ders.</p>
    <p>One of its plea­sures is the at­ten­tion to the de­tails of those early days; we’ve spent enough time coping that pan­demic nostal­gia is ac­tu­ally a real, if un­set­tling, thing.</p>
    <p>Re­mem­ber ther­mome­ter short­ages? Re­mem­ber mak­ing your own hand sani­tiser? Re­mem­ber sour­dough?</p>
    <p>It is earnest, rea­son­ably am­bi­tious and lightly funny.</p>
    <p>But Con­nect­ing... lacks con­nec­tion, its char­ac­ters and dy­nam­ics too stan­dard is­sue to at­tach to. Too many of the quick-ban­ter jokes feel as if they need a laugh track, and if you are talk­ing about 2020 in 2020, the kind of laughs that feel most believable come with a catch in the throat.</p>
    <p>That is the mode of the more­ef­fec­tive So­cial Dis­tance, an eightepiso­de an­thol­ogy com­edy cre­ated by Hi­lary Weis­man Gra­ham of Or­ange Is The New Black (2013 to 2019).</p>
    <p>As on Or­ange, the com­edy of So­cial Dis­tance is sharp, provoca­tive and cathar­tic and, more of­ten than not, it is rooted in pain.</p>
    <p>Though the episodes are short, some less than 20 min­utes, watching them feels like en­ter­ing the lives of full char­ac­ters who have sto­ries and con­flicts that pre­date the pan­demic and would be in­ter­est­ing even with­out it.</p>
    <p>The episodes are like tight one­act stage plays, rang­ing from sex farce to just this side of melo­drama.</p>
    <p>In the episode Delete All Fu­ture Events, Ike (Mike Colter), an al­co­holic, has a few months of so­bri­ety un­der his belt when the lock­down hits and his girl­friend leaves him. The isolation hits twice as hard for some­one in re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>“Just fo­cus on you,” his Al­co­holics Anony­mous friend Gene (Steven We­ber) urges him over FaceTime.</p>
    <p>“If I fo­cus on me any more, I’m go­ing to get my­self preg­nant,” Ike an­swers.</p>
    <p>The nar­ra­tive form says some­thing about life in quar­an­tine, but it also cap­tures dig­i­tal life in 2020 gen­er­ally.</p>
    <p>The sea­son is or­gan­ised chrono­log­i­cally and as it moves for­ward, the sto­ries be­come less ex­clu­sively about the pan­demic, just as life it­self did with time.</p>
    <p>The final episode, about black video tech­ni­cians set­ting up to shoot a vir­tual grad­u­a­tion for a largely white prep school, fo­cuses on the racial-jus­tice protests af­ter the killing of Mr Ge­orge Floyd.</p>
    <p>Whether or not any of these shows be­comes a hit or a last­ing clas­sic, they are pieces of his­tory.</p>
    <p>If the global emer­gency doesn’t drag on for years, they could be among peo­ple’s only pop-cul­ture records of how peo­ple lived in the pan­demic, cap­tured by the tools peo­ple used in the pan­demic.</p>
