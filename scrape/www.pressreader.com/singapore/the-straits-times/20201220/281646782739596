    <p>“Check­ing in” took on a new mean­ing in 2020 be­cause of the ubiq­ui­tous SafeEn­try, Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional dig­i­tal check-in sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Us­ing SafeEn­try to en­ter any public venue has be­come part of Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents’ ev­ery­day rou­tine amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>As re­cently as Fe­bru­ary, con­tact trac­ing was still a strictly low-tech process, which be­gan with get­ting a con­firmed Covid-19 pa­tient warded in hos­pi­tal to do an ac­tiv­ity map of ev­ery­thing he had done and the peo­ple he had met over the pre­vi­ous two weeks.</p>
    <p>If there were gaps, con­tact trac­ing teams would call pa­tients to try and jog their mem­ory.</p>
    <p>But as daily new cases hit dou­ble, triple and then four dig­its in April, SafeEn­try was born dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod out of the ne­ces­sity for large-scale con­tact trac­ing to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem, which logs key in­for­ma­tion, in­clud­ing a per­son’s name, NRIC num­ber and mo­bile num­ber when users scan a QR code, was first in­tro­duced for es­sen­tial busi­nesses such as clin­ics, su­per­mar­kets and food and bev­er­age out­lets.</p>
    <p>On May 12, SafeEn­try was made manda­tory at all work­places and busi­nesses, in­clud­ing hair­dressers, op­ti­cal shops and cake shops that were al­lowed to re­open at the time.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 45,000 premises were us­ing SafeEn­try by then, up from about 2,100 just two weeks ear­lier.</p>
    <p>SafeEn­try evolved rapidly over the next few months.</p>
    <p>Ini­tially, the check-in process could be done only by us­ing a smart­phone cam­era to scan a QR code, or by scan­ning the bar code on NRICs.</p>
    <p>By the mid­dle of May, SafeEn­try had been in­te­grated into the SingPass Mo­bile app, a move that was a pre­cur­sor to Sin­ga­pore’s cur­rent model of con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>Un­der this lat­est model, SafeEn­try has been sub­sumed by na­tional con­tact trac­ing pro­gramme TraceTo­gether, which com­prises an app and to­ken that use prox­im­ity data col­lected via Blue­tooth tech­nol­ogy to iden­tify peo­ple who have come into close con­tact with Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>The app in­cludes a func­tion for scan­ning SafeEn­try QR codes, while the to­kens sport a QR code with a sim­i­lar func­tion.</p>
    <p>Check­ing in with the TraceTo­gether app or to­ken will soon be made manda­tory at public venues, in­clud­ing restau­rants and shop­ping malls, once an on­go­ing ex­er­cise to dis­trib­ute to­kens to the public has wrapped up.</p>
    <p>The app was launched be­fore SafeEn­try in March but had been down­loaded by less than half of Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­la­tion as at Septem­ber, well short of the 70 per cent needed for it to be ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>This was in part due to tech­ni­cal is­sues with the app – which pre­vi­ously did not work well with iPhones and also caused sig­nif­i­cant bat­tery drain – as well as pri­vacy con­cerns from the public.</p>
    <p>The idea for a wear­able con­tact trac­ing de­vice to drive up par­tic­i­pa­tion rate was mooted by Min­is­terin-charge of the Smart Na­tion Ini­tia­tive Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan in June, with na­tion­wide dis­tri­bu­tion of the to­kens kick­ing off in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>This ex­er­cise also ran into teething is­sues, as de­mand for the to­kens surged af­ter the au­thor­i­ties an­nounced on Oct 20 that TraceTo­gether check-ins would be com­pul­sory at public venues by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>Long queues formed at com­mu­nity cen­tres and var­i­ous col­lec­tion points around the is­land.</p>
    <p>This led to the Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment Group sus­pend­ing to­ken col­lec­tion for one day, be­fore re­sum­ing the dis­tri­bu­tion in a stag­gered fash­ion, one con­stituency at a time.</p>
    <p>The par­tic­i­pa­tion rate for TraceTo­gether has since climbed to around 65 per cent as at last Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Education Min­is­ter and co-chair­man of the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling Covid-19, Mr Lawrence Wong, said at a re­cent press con­fer­ence that Sin­ga­pore will be able to achieve a par­tic­i­pa­tion rate of around 70 per cent by the end of this year.</p>
    <p>“But we will not stop there. We want to achieve an even higher par­tic­i­pa­tion rate, be it through the down­load­ing of the TraceTo­gether app or the dis­tri­bu­tion of to­kens which will con­tinue through­out all our com­mu­nity cen­tres,” he added.</p>
