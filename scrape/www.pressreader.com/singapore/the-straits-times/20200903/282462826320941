    <p>AM­S­TER­DAM Frenkie de Jong has lifted the lid on the tur­moil en­gulf­ing Barcelona fol­low­ing Lionel Messi’s trans­fer re­quest, call­ing it “a mess”.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old is on in­ter­na­tional duty with the Nether­lands as the Oranje gear up for their Na­tions League games with Poland to­mor­row and Italy next Mon­day.</p>
    <p>But with for­mer na­tional coach Ron­ald Koe­man hav­ing re­cently de­parted for the Nou Camp, lo­cal media have been par­tic­u­larly fo­cused on events at Barca.</p>
    <p>The mid­fielder told re­porters that he could not com­ment on the state of Messi’s mind, hav­ing not spo­ken to his club cap­tain since the Ar­gen­tinian in­formed the La Liga side via his rep­re­sen­ta­tives that he wanted to leave his boy­hood club.</p>
    <p>But de Jong re­vealed that the Nou Camp is not a happy place, with the team reel­ing from one cri­sis to an­other, on top of their tal­is­man’s pos­si­ble de­par­ture.</p>
    <p>He told broad­caster NOS: “It’s a mess at Barcelona, so many strange things hap­pen­ing. It’s chaos.</p>
    <p>“I haven’t talked to him (Messi) about this my­self. Nor the club. So I hon­estly do not know how it is. But if Messi re­ally leaves, it will be a huge blow to the team and the club.</p>
    <p>“When I come back af­ter these in­ter­na­tional matches, I will see what has hap­pened at the club.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t call him. I think enough peo­ple want to know about him. I</p>
    <p>A pic­ture of Lionel Messi on dis­play at Barcelona’s mu­seum. The for­ward will al­ways be a big part of the club’s his­tory but his Nou Camp fu­ture ap­pears over. don’t have such a good relationsh­ip with him that I call him and ask him how it is.”</p>
    <p>The for­mer Ajax Am­s­ter­dam star, who left the Ere­di­visie side last sum­mer for Barca, also said Messi was still in­side the play­ers’ What­sApp group chat. That has lent hope the 33-year-old can still be per­suaded to stay, but pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Vic­tor Font be­lieves it is a lost cause.</p>
    <p>Font is one of the prime can­di­dates to suc­ceed em­bat­tled Barca pres­i­dent Josep Maria Bar­tomeu in the next elec­tions in March, though it can be called even ear­lier, with Messi said to be de­mand­ing the in­cum­bent’s res­ig­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Bar­tomeu has al­ready of­fered to leave his po­si­tion if that re­sults in the Ar­gentina for­ward stay­ing, but that is un­likely to pla­cate the star.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing Bar­tomeu’s six years in charge, there was a so­cial media scan­dal that saw a dig­i­tal firm en­gaged by the club at­tack the play­ers; the res­ig­na­tion of sev­eral club di­rec­tors; to bal­loon­ing debt over reck­less spend­ing de­spite Barca be­ing the world’s rich­est club, ac­cord­ing to the Deloitte Money League.</p>
    <p>Blam­ing Bar­tomeu for fail­ing “to build a com­pet­i­tive team”, Font told Sky Sports: “I re­ally hope the de­ci­sion can be changed. It doesn’t seem likely though... if that’s the case, the fo­cus should be on mak­ing the tran­si­tion as smooth as pos­si­ble.”</p>
