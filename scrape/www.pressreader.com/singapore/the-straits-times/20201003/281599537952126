    <p>For­eign business cham­bers in Sin­ga­pore are wor­ried that the re­cent rise in anti-for­eigner sen­ti­ments and scru­tiny of the role of for­eign man­power could neg­a­tively im­pact fu­ture in­vest­ments from the global business com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tives from 16 for­eign cham­bers voiced these con­cerns to Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing on Thurs­day dur­ing a dia­logue hosted by the Sin­ga­pore Business Fed­er­a­tion (SBF).</p>
    <p>They noted that Sin­ga­pore’s sta­ble and pre­dictable business en­vi­ron­ment as well as con­nec­tiv­ity and open­ness have en­cour­aged many of their mem­bers to set up re­gional head­quar­ters and op­er­a­tions here.</p>
    <p>But the re­cent rise in anti-for­eigner sen­ti­ments could give the “wrong im­pres­sion” to the in­ter­na­tional business com­mu­nity that Sin­ga­pore is be­com­ing closed to for­eign in­vest­ments and global tal­ents, the business lead­ers said.</p>
    <p>They high­lighted to Mr Chan that Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to re­quire global tal­ent to sup­ple­ment the lo­cal work­force so that it can meet the needs of a chang­ing econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day that he as­sured them Sin­ga­pore re­mains com­mit­ted to be­ing open and con­nected to the world. “This will never change,” he said. “We recog­nise the role that in­ter­na­tional com­pa­nies and work­ers have played in grow­ing Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy and in­tend to con­tinue to en­sure we pro­vide a busi­ness­friendly en­vi­ron­ment for them to op­er­ate in.”</p>
    <p>But, he added, Sin­ga­pore­ans are in­creas­ingly anx­ious about their fu­ture in these un­prece­dented times.</p>
    <p>“It is im­por­tant that we work to­gether to sup­port our Singaporea­n work­ers and as­sure them that we will al­ways pro­vide a fair and level play­ing field,” the min­is­ter said.</p>
    <p>“In this re­gard, I was very heart­ened by the in­ter­na­tional business cham­bers’ as­sur­ance that their mem­bers were deeply com­mit­ted to de­vel­op­ing their Sin­ga­pore work­force and would con­tinue to abide by fair hir­ing prac­tices.”</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, SBF chief ex­ec­u­tive Ho Meng Kit urged the for­eign cham­bers, who gave “many ex­am­ples of their mem­bers’ ef­forts to de­velop the Sin­ga­pore core”, to pub­li­cise their ef­forts and en­gage the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“All these will help to square the de­bate (on) how our for­eign com­pa­nies are here to add to the econ­omy and not to take away value from it,” he said.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean Cham­ber of Com­merce pres­i­dent Fed­erico Donato told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that Sin­ga­pore­ans should take pride in the fact that the coun­try is com­pet­ing with the likes of ma­jor global cities London and New York.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore is play­ing in the Cham­pi­ons League and it should be proud of that, but if you want to play in this league, you need to have Messi and Ron­aldo,” he added, re­fer­ring to foot­ball stars Lionel Messi, an Ar­gen­tinian who plays for Span­ish club Barcelona, and Cris­tiano Ron­aldo, a Por­tuguese who plays for Ital­ian club Ju­ven­tus.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, the for­eign cham­bers also urged the Gov­ern­ment to push for the open­ing of bor­ders with more coun­tries so that business travel can re­sume.</p>
    <p>They also called for the pi­lot Business Travel Pass to be ex­tended to more com­pa­nies and em­ploy­ees, and for the Gov­ern­ment to move from a stay-home no­tice (SHN) regime to a test­ing regime with a shorter SHN for business trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said the Gov­ern­ment un­der­stood the need for business travel to re­sume and will con­tinue to push for the open­ing of bor­ders in a safe man­ner, bal­anced against health and safety con­cerns.</p>
    <p>But to do so, mu­tual con­sen­sus be­tween coun­tries is nec­es­sary to es­tab­lish bi­lat­eral travel ar­range­ments, and shar­ing of in­for­ma­tion among gov­ern­ments on their lo­cal Covid-19 sit­u­a­tions would bet­ter fa­cil­i­tate re­sump­tion of travel, said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Cham­ber of Com­merce ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Kate Bal­dock told The Straits Times that her or­gan­i­sa­tion has been ad­vo­cat­ing for Sin­ga­pore-Aus­tralia bor­ders to re­open for business travel.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties had an­nounced on Wed­nes­day that Sin­ga­pore will al­low vis­i­tors from Aus­tralia, ex­clud­ing those from Vic­to­ria state, to en­ter the coun­try from next Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia, how­ever, has yet to re­cip­ro­cate the move.</p>
    <p>Ms Bal­dock noted that com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion of Covid-19 has been “very low” in Sin­ga­pore, and said: “The way ‘green lane’ travel has been done for other coun­tries shows that re­sum­ing business travel can be man­aged and mit­i­gated.”</p>
