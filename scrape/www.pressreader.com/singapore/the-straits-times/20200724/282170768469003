    <p>CapitaLand Com­mer­cial Trust’s (CCT) dis­tri­bu­tion per unit (DPU) fell by 23.2 per cent to 1.69 cents for its sec­ond quar­ter ended June 30, from 2.20 cents a year ago.</p>
    <p>Gross rev­enue was down 8.1 per cent to $92.8 mil­lion for the quar­ter, from $101 mil­lion a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Net prop­erty in­come (NPI) fell 9.7 per cent on the year to $70.8 mil­lion for the quar­ter, from $78.4 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>For the quar­ter un­der re­view, con­tri­bu­tions from Main Air­port Cen­tre, which was ac­quired in Septem­ber last year, as well as higher rev­enue from Gallileo, were off­set by lower in­come from prop­er­ties in Sin­ga­pore that were af­fected by up­grad­ing works, lower oc­cu­pan­cies and rental waivers to ten­ants, the man­ager said in a reg­u­la­tory fil­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Main Air­port Cen­tre is a free­hold multi-ten­anted of­fice build­ing near the Frank­furt In­ter­na­tional Air­port, while Gallileo is a Grade A com­mer­cial build­ing lo­cated in Frank­furt’s cen­tral busi­ness dis­trict.</p>
    <p>In­come avail­able for dis­tri­bu­tion to unithold­ers de­clined 28.2 per cent year-on-year to $59.2 mil­lion, from $82.4 mil­lion. This was due to lower net prop­erty i ncome, re­duced con­tri­bu­tion from RCS Trust by $13.2 mil­lion, and pay­ment of as­set man­age­ment fees for Asia Square Tower 2 in cash, the man­ager said.</p>
    <p>As at June 30, CCT’s port­fo­lio in­cludes Raf­fles City Sin­ga­pore, held through its 60 per cent in­ter­est in RCS Trust.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, distributa­ble in­come, which in­cluded the re­lease of $6.4 mil­lion re­tained in Q1 2020, came in at $65.6 mil­lion, down 20.4 per cent from a year ago.</p>
    <p>The dis­tri­bu­tion will be paid out on Aug 28, af­ter books clo­sure on Aug 3.</p>
    <p>For the half year ended June 30, DPU was lower at 3.34 cents, versus 4.40 cents a year ago, and dis</p>
