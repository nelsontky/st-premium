    <p>Myan­mar’s election com­mis­sion of­fi­cially con­firmed the vic­tory of Ms Aung San Suu Kyi’s Na­tional League for Democ­racy (NLD) yes­ter­day, as the pow­er­ful mil­i­tary steered clear of de­mands by some that it help restage the Nov 8 gen­eral election.</p>
    <p>By yes­ter­day af­ter­noon, the NLD had of­fi­cially won at least 384 out of the 476 seats con­tested, putting it on track to bet­ter its com­mand­ing per­for­mance in the 2015 polls. Votes are still be­ing tal­lied.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond election since the end of junta rule in Myan­mar was held amid a rag­ing coro­n­avirus pan­demic, but was one that vot­ers gen­er­ally shrugged off to hand the NLD a strong man­date un­der the coun­try’s power-shar­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The 2008 junta-drafted Con­sti­tu­tion guar­an­tees the mil­i­tary con­trol of a quar­ter of all par­lia­men­tary seats as well as the de­fence, bor­der af­fairs and home af­fairs min­istries.</p>
    <p>The big­gest loser in the polls was the Union Sol­i­dar­ity and De­vel­op­ment Party (USDP), widely seen as a proxy of the mil­i­tary, which saw sev­eral of its as­sumed-to-be “safe” seats snatched by the NLD. In an in­dig­nant press con­fer­ence on Wed­nes­day, the USDP al­leged mas­sive ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties and de­manded that the election be held again with help from the mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>But the mil­i­tary dis­tanced it­self from this de­mand.</p>
    <p>“What­ever the USDP said wasn’t dis­cussed with the Tat­madaw,” Bri­gadier-Gen­eral Zaw Min Tun, a mil­i­tary spokesman, told BBC Burmese on Thurs­day, us­ing the lo­cal term for the armed forces.</p>
    <p>He reaf­firmed the com­ments made by mil­i­tary chief Min Aung Hlaing, who had said that he would “ac­cept peo­ple’s wishes” when he cast his bal­lot on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The Tat­madaw even made what looked like a ten­ta­tive over­ture to the Arakan Army, an eth­nic Rakhine armed group with which it re­mains locked in fierce bat­tle, in Rakhine state.</p>
    <p>La­belled a ter­ror­ist group by the gov­ern­ment, the Arakan Army is shut out of peace talks that in­volve sev­eral other eth­nic armed groups. In the lead-up to the Nov 8 polls, it kid­napped three NLD can­di­dates. Vot­ing in much of the state was can­celled over se­cu­rity con­cerns.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, the Arakan Army said it would ex­tend its “uni­lat­eral cease­fire” un­til Dec 31 and urged the au­thor­i­ties to hold by-elec­tions in Rakhine state as soon as pos­si­ble to en­sure peo­ple were rep­re­sented in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>The Tat­madaw said it wel­comed the state­ment and that it “will co­or­di­nate as much as pos­si­ble to hold by-elec­tions in the re­main­ing ar­eas”.</p>
    <p>The NLD, mean­while, has reached out to eth­nic mi­nor­ity par­ties to work to­gether to end Myan­mar’s civil wars and create a demo­cratic fed­eral union.</p>
    <p>In a let­ter to 48 po­lit­i­cal par­ties made pub­lic on Thurs­day, it said: “The eth­nic par­ties’ ob­jec­tives are the same as the NLD’s and the NLD would pri­ori­tise the eth­nic’s de­sires in the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>Ob­servers hope this would mark a re­set of re­la­tions be­tween the NLD and eth­nic mi­nor­ity groups, which had soured over the past five years amid fal­ter­ing peace ne­go­ti­a­tions. While sev­eral eth­nic mi­nor­ity par­ties banded to­gether for the Nov 8 election, they made lit­tle head­way un­der Myan­mar’s first­past-the-post sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Ms Thin­zar Shun­lei Yi, ad­vo­cacy co­or­di­na­tor of the Yan­gon-based Ac­tion Com­mit­tee for Democ­racy De­vel­op­ment, called for the NLD to show some “po­lit­i­cal will”.</p>
    <p>“They should first start a di­a­logue to build un­der­stand­ing among the lead­ers, which will send a mes­sage about mu­tual re­spect to the next gen­er­a­tion,” she said.</p>
