    <p>Also known as “tur­tle is­land”, Kusu Is­land is a 15-minute ferry ride from St John’s Is­land. Home to the Da Bo Gong (Tua Pek Kong) Tem­ple and the Malay kera­mats or shrines, it is awash in an air of seren­ity that seems to per­me­ate its vis­i­tors, such as a kind soul who shared her charg­ing ca­ble with me when my phone bat­tery died.</p>
    <p>Tua Pek Kong Tem­ple care­taker Seet Seng Huat, 72, a former bum­boat man who has worked at the tem­ple for decades, lives on the is­land and rel­ishes the peace and quiet. His affin­ity with the tem­ple runs deep – he is a third-gen­er­a­tion care­taker.</p>
    <p>Things are busier since the month-long Kusu pil­grim­age be­gan this weekend. The sea­son typ­i­cally sees thou­sands of devo­tees flock­ing to the is­land to pray for health and pros­per­ity. Child­less cou­ples also pray for chil­dren.</p>
    <p>They stop at the tem­ple and of­ten head to a nearby hillock where they climb 152 steps to the three kera­mats, built in hon­our of a 19th-cen­tury pious man, Syed Ab­dul Rah­man, and his mother and sis­ter.</p>
    <p>I’m in­trigued by the di­ver­sity at play here. At the kera­mats, I also spot a devo­tee throw­ing a pair of cres­cent-shaped div­ina­tion blocks, which are typ­i­cally used in Taoist temples to find out if a wish will be granted.</p>
    <p>One thing that catches your eye at the top of the steps (af­ter you catch your breath) is a rocky wall painted in yel­low and scrib­bled with mes­sages left by vis­i­tors in English, Chi­nese and even Viet­namese.</p>
    <p>“Hope Covid-19 will end soon so we can all re­turn to Malaysia!” reads one Chi­nese mes­sage, pos­si­bly left by a mi­grant worker.</p>
    <p>“Hope to give birth to a son soon,” reads an­other. Oth­ers ask for love and good grades.</p>
    <p>A 77-year-old re­tired busi­ness­man, who gave his name only as Mr Chua, was at the shrines and tem­ple last weekend to pray for safety and good health.</p>
    <p>The is­land has changed a lot since his younger days, he tells me, lament­ing that it is now more “ar­ti­fi­cial” and does not have the same rus­tic feel any­more.</p>
