    <p>The founder and a part­ner of Perak-based dig­i­tal game store SEA Gamer Mall have been de­tained in Malaysia af­ter be­ing ac­cused by the United States of in­volve­ment in an in­ter­na­tional hack­ing group. The US said the two Malaysians will face ex­tra­di­tion pro­ceed­ings, along with five Chi­nese na­tion­als who were also charged.</p>
    <p>The founder and a part­ner of Per­ak­based SEA Gamer Mall, a dig­i­tal game store, have been de­tained in Malaysia af­ter be­ing ac­cused by the US Depart­ment of Jus­tice (DOJ) of in­volve­ment in in­ter­na­tional hack­ing group APT-41.</p>
    <p>The two men were ar­rested by Malaysian po­lice at 8.45am on Mon­day in the coastal Perak town of Si­ti­awan, af­ter an ex­tra­di­tion re­quest from the United States “for sus­pected money-laun­der­ing ac­tiv­i­ties and cy­ber­crimes”, a Malaysian po­lice state­ment said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The ex­tra­di­tion re­quest was sub­mit­ted by the US on Sept 3 and Malaysia’s At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers ap­proved it in ac­cor­dance with the Ex­tra­di­tion Act 1992 be­tween Malaysia and the US, the po­lice state­ment said.</p>
    <p>The duo was found “to be sell­ing unau­tho­rised/il­le­gal gam­ing arte­facts like cred­its. The foren­sics team has seized ev­i­dence and doc­u­ments in re­la­tion to their com­pany”, the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>SEA Gamer Mall in a sep­a­rate state­ment said the two men have been put on tem­po­rary leave and that the com­pany has been of­fer­ing the au­thor­i­ties full co­op­er­a­tion on the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The DOJ named the t wo Malaysians as Wong Ong Hua and Ling Yang Ching. Wong is the founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of SEA Gamer Mall, while Ling is listed as a part­ner and chief prod­uct of­fi­cer, ac­cord­ing to the com­pany web­site.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s po­lice chief Ab­dul Hamid Bador ear­lier told The Straits Times that the ar­rests in Si­ti­awan were con­ducted un­der the Mu­tual Le­gal As­sis­tance Treaty (MLAT).</p>
    <p>He said: “The ar­rests are at the re­quest of the US which uses the MLAT al­lo­ca­tion to de­tect, ar­rest and ex­tra­dite the sus­pects.”</p>
    <p>The treaty al­lows for law en­force­ment co­op­er­a­tion and as­sis­tance in a crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion or pro­ceed­ing.</p>
    <p>“They will un­dergo the court pro­cess to be ex­tra­dited to the US,” Tan Sri Ab­dul Hamid said.</p>
    <p>The SEA Gamer Mall’s state­ment said: “We have been made aware of the Amer­i­can al­le­ga­tions against two em­ploy­ees of the com­pany re­cently. The two em­ploy­ees con­cerned are tem­po­rar­ily on leave pend­ing the res­o­lu­tion of the mat­ter.”</p>
    <p>“As a re­spon­si­ble com­pany serv­ing mil­lions of cus­tomers around the world we are com­mit­ted to and have been of­fer­ing full co­op­er­a­tion and as­sis­tance to the au­thor­i­ties,” the state­ment added. “With­out com­pro­mis­ing the in­tegrity of any on­go­ing le­gal pro­cess, suf­fice to say that the com­pany has never en­gaged in any il­le­gal ac­tiv­ity as we are a home-grown Malaysian com­pany with hun­dreds of em­ploy­ees and mil­lions of cus­tomers all around the world.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany on its web­site said it sells cred­its for a wide range of ser­vice providers in­clud­ing Ap­ple iTunes, Sing­tel, and gamemak­ers such as Ori­gin, Sony Playsta­tion EA and Bl­iz­zard.</p>
    <p>It claims to have 1.9 mil­lion reg­is­tered users world­wide.</p>
    <p>The US DOJ re­port states that Wong, 46, and Ling, 32, will face ex­tra­di­tion pro­ceed­ings, along with five Chi­nese na­tion­als who were also charged.</p>
    <p>They were al­legedly run­ning global hack­ing op­er­a­tions for at least six years to steal iden­ti­ties and video game tech­nol­ogy, plant ran­somware and spy on Hong Kong ac­tivists.</p>
    <p>The DOJ, in a sec­ond in­dict­ment last month, charged Wong and Ling with 23 counts of rack­e­teer­ing, con­spir­acy, iden­tity theft, ag­gra­vated iden­tity theft, ac­cess de­vice fraud, money laun­der­ing, vi­o­la­tions of the Com­puter Fraud and Abuse Act, and falsely reg­is­ter­ing do­main names.</p>
    <p>While not much is known about Ling, the com­pany’s founder Wong is an elec­tri­cal, elec­tron­ics and com­mu­ni­ca­tions engi­neer­ing grad­u­ate from Univer­siti Te­knologi Malaysia. He founded his busi­ness in 2007 with just one com­puter from his house in Perak.</p>
    <p>“He’s a fam­ily per­son. When­ever he has time to spare, he would take his fam­ily to travel around the world or sim­ply spend his time in his home town,” a close friend of Wong, who de­clined to be iden­ti­fied, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Wong has been an avid gamer since his un­der­grad­u­ate days, spend­ing five to six hours ev­ery day to play games, said a re­port in Malaysian daily The Sun.</p>
