    <p>The award of this year’s No­bel Peace Prize to the United Na­tions World Food Pro­gramme (WFP) rightly recog­nises its ef­forts to com­bat world hunger. The or­gan­i­sa­tion was recog­nised for its ef­forts in feed­ing mil­lions from Ye­men to North Korea, with the coro­n­avirus pan­demic seen to be push­ing mil­lions more into hunger. The WFP was hon­oured for “act­ing as a driv­ing force in ef­forts to pre­vent the use of hunger as a weapon of war and con­flict”, the No­bel com­mit­tee said. In mak­ing a fun­da­men­tal con­nec­tion be­tween food and con­flict, the award pro­vides an ap­po­site re­minder of the state of the world, when re­source wars be­tween and within states rep­re­sent both a hu­man­i­tar­ian cri­sis and a pos­si­ble struc­tural re­con­fig­u­ra­tion of in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Clearly, there can be no peace with­out eq­ui­table ac­cess to food and wa­ter, which are re­sources that can lead to war or civil war. The prediction made in the clos­ing years of the last cen­tury – that the wars of this cen­tury will be about wa­ter – has not come to pass yet, but sub-na­tional con­flicts over this es­sen­tial re­source do oc­cur and could spill across bor­ders. Like­wise, food short­ages and price hikes were iden­ti­fied as an im­me­di­ately an­tecedent fac­tor in the French and Rus­sian rev­o­lu­tions that trans­formed global af­fairs vi­o­lently. Closer to these times, schol­ars have pointed to the over­lap be­tween mas­sive global food price spikes and the Arab Spring up­ris­ings a decade ago. Such de­vel­op­ments im­pinge on the global se­cu­rity sys­tem.</p>
    <p>A re­port in 2013 noted that the UN sys­tem spent more than US$40 bil­lion in the past cen­tury on con­trol­ling con­flict in the de­vel­op­ing world. The re­la­tion­ship be­tween global cli­mate change and lo­cal food avail­abil­ity and prices also con­sti­tutes a gen­uine se­cu­rity threat. There is a mar­ket el­e­ment as well in that re­la­tion­ship. Mas­sive agri­cul­tural sub­si­dies in the West have been blamed for dis­tort­ing the mar­ket for farmers in the de­vel­op­ing world, who can­not com­pete with the in­flow of cheap food from abroad. As the premier global in­sti­tu­tion, the UN is al­ways called on to pro­vide a de­gree of eq­ui­tabil­ity in the con­duct of world af­fairs. The WFP em­bod­ies that re­sponse in ways that have saved lives in some of the most vul­ner­a­ble re­gions around the globe.</p>
    <p>Greater chal­lenges await the Rome-based agency, which is the world’s big­gest hu­man­i­tar­ian or­gan­i­sa­tion. It warns that the hunger pan­demic caused by Covid-19 could re­sult in acute hunger in the 88 coun­tries in which it op­er­ates, reach­ing 270 mil­lion peo­ple by the year end – an 82 per cent in­crease over last year. The WFP’s ad­vo­cacy of the role of hunger and con­flict in con­tain­ing each other de­serves the sup­port of states and cit­i­zens alike. It can only be hoped that the No­bel Peace Prize will make the world at large in­vest more closely in the WFP’s ir­re­place­able role.</p>
