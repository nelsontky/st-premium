    <p>South Korean stu­dents in Seoul and its sur­round­ing ar­eas will re­turn to on­line classes start­ing today, amid mount­ing con­cerns over school safety as the coun­try ex­pe­ri­ences a resur­gence of the coronaviru­s.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion an­nounced yes­ter­day that all stu­dents, in­clud­ing those in kinder­gartens, in Seoul, In­cheon and Gyeonggi prov­ince will have home-based on­line learn­ing un­til Sept 11.</p>
    <p>The lat­est mea­sure does not, how­ever, ap­ply to high school se­niors, who are sched­uled to take the na­tional univer­sity en­trance exam in early De­cem­ber, Yon­hap news agency re­ported.</p>
    <p>The South Korean health au­thor­i­ties have warned that the coun­try is on the brink of a na­tion­wide Covid-19 out­break due to the spread of church­linked in­fec­tions and a grow­ing num­ber of pa­tients with un­known sources of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>SEOUL • South Korea yes­ter­day or­dered most schools in Seoul and sur­round­ing ar­eas to close and move classes back on­line, the lat­est in a se­ries of pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures aimed at head­ing off a resur­gence in coronaviru­s cases.</p>
    <p>The Korea Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion (KCDC) re­ported 280 new cases as of Monday mid­night, bring­ing the coun­try’s to­tal to 17,945 with 310 deaths.</p>
    <p>That rep­re­sents a drop in daily new in­fec­tions from 397 re­ported on mid­night last Saturday, the high­est daily tally since early March.</p>
    <p>With most of the new cases cen­tred on the densely pop­u­lated cap­i­tal area, how­ever, the health au­thor­i­ties say the coun­try is on the brink of a na­tion­wide out­break and have called on peo­ple to stay home and limit travel.</p>
    <p>“It would be too hasty to say the curve has flat­tened,” KCDC deputy di­rec­tor Kwon Jun-wook told a brief­ing. “There is still a high risk that cases could con­tinue to rise.”</p>
    <p>The past week has seen three times as many se­ri­ous cases com­pared with past spikes, he said, rais­ing con­cerns that the death toll could rise.</p>
    <p>All stu­dents, ex­cept for high school se­niors, in the cities of Seoul and In­cheon and the prov­ince of Gyeonggi will take classes on­line un­til Sept 11, the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The be­gin­ning of the spring se­mes­ter had been post­poned sev­eral times since March, but as daily Covid-19 cases dropped sharply from a Fe­bru­ary peak, most of South Korea’s schools re­opened in stages between May 20 and June 1.</p>
    <p>Over the past two weeks, at least 150 stu­dents and 43 school staff have tested pos­i­tive in the greater Seoul area, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Yoo Eun-hae told a brief­ing.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Park Ne­ung-hoo yes­ter­day also pleaded with thou­sands of doc­tors who have been stag­ing walk­outs to re­turn to work.</p>
    <p>“We sin­cerely ask the med­i­cal staff to promptly re­turn to the med­i­cal ground, where the pa­tients are await­ing,” he said at a meet­ing.</p>
    <p>The doc­tors are protest­ing against sev­eral gov­ern­ment pro­pos­als, in­clud­ing a plan to in­crease the num­ber of med­i­cal stu­dents by 4,000 over the next 10 years.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment says the plan is nec­es­sary to be bet­ter pre­pared for public health crises like the coronaviru­s pan­demic, but doc­tors’ as­so­ci­a­tions have said it would un­nec­es­sar­ily flood the mar­ket and do lit­tle to fix more sys­temic prob­lems.</p>
    <p>To try to stem the lat­est surge in virus cases, Seoul on Monday or­dered masks to be worn in both in­door and out­door public places for the first time, and has or­dered places such as churches, night­clubs, karaoke bars and other high­risk venues closed.</p>
    <p>One re­cent case has un­der­scored the po­ten­tial value of wear­ing masks.</p>
    <p>Four mask-wear­ing em­ploy­ees es­caped in­fec­tion af­ter a woman with the coronaviru­s vis­ited a Star­bucks cafe north of Seoul this month, while more than two dozen pa­trons tested pos­i­tive days later.</p>
    <p>The Aug 8 out­break in the South Korean city of Paju is an ex­am­ple of how rapidly the virus can spread in con­fined, in­door spaces – as well as ways to min­imise trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>With health au­thor­i­ties around the world still de­bat­ing the ev­i­dence around face masks, the 27-per­son clus­ter linked to the air­con­di­tioned cof­fee out­let adds more sup­port for their manda­tory use to help limit the spread of the virus that causes Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“This speaks vol­umes about the role masks can play,” said Dr Ma Sang Hyuk, a pae­di­atric in­fec­tious dis­eases physi­cian at Chang­won Fa­tima Hos­pi­tal in South Korea.</p>
    <p>“Masks may not pro­vide 100 per cent pro­tec­tion, but there’s noth­ing out there that’s as ef­fec­tive.”</p>
    <p>The Star­bucks in­fec­tions later led to about three dozen more cases out­side the cof­fee shop as of Monday.</p>
    <p>The case is one of “the most im­por­tant op­por­tu­ni­ties to study risk fac­tors among a more or less con­trolled co­hort of peo­ple”, said Dr Arnold Bos­man, di­rec­tor of Trans­mis­si­ble BV, a Nether­lands-based devel­oper of train­ing ma­te­ri­als for out­break con­trol.</p>
    <p>“This Star­bucks event will be a very valu­able train­ing ex­er­cise for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions of epi­demi­ol­o­gists.”</p>
    <p>The be­gin­ning of the spring se­mes­ter had been post­poned sev­eral times since March, but as daily Covid-19 cases dropped sharply from a Fe­bru­ary peak, most of South Korea’s schools re­opened in stages between May 20 and June 1.</p>
