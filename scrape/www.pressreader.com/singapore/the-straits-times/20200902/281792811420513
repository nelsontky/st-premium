    <p>GENEVA • The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) has urged gov­ern­ments to en­gage with peo­ple ral­ly­ing against Covid-19 re­stric­tions and to lis­ten to their con­cerns, but stressed that pro­test­ers needed to un­der­stand the virus is dan­ger­ous.</p>
    <p>When asked about re­cent ral­lies in a num­ber of coun­tries against coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions, WHO di­rec­tor-gen­eral Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus said it was im­por­tant to “lis­ten to what peo­ple are ask­ing, what peo­ple are say­ing”.</p>
    <p>“We should en­gage in an hon­est di­a­logue,” he told re­porters on Mon­day, stress­ing though that demon­stra­tors have a re­spon­si­bil­ity to en­sure protests are safe.</p>
    <p>“The virus is real. It is dan­ger­ous. It moves fast and it kills,” he said, and in­sisted that “we have to do ev­ery­thing to pro­tect our­selves and to pro­tect oth­ers”.</p>
    <p>Ger­man po­lice last Satur­day halted a Ber­lin march by tens of thou­sands of peo­ple op­posed to coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions, in the big­gest of sev­eral Euro­pean protests against face mask rules and other anti-virus curbs.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral hun­dred of the Ber­lin pro­test­ers then broke through bar­ri­ers and a po­lice cor­don to storm Ger­many’s Par­lia­ment, in a move Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel con­demned as “shame­ful”.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing about the broader protests, WHO emer­gen­cies chief Michael Ryan said “epi­demics and emer­gen­cies cre­ate strong emo­tions, and ac­cep­tance of mea­sures is al­ways very, very tough”.</p>
    <p>“It is re­ally im­por­tant that gov­ern­ments don’t over­re­act to peo­ple protest­ing against mea­sures,” he told the vir­tual brief­ing. “The real im­por­tant thing to do is to en­ter into a di­a­logue with groups.”</p>
    <p>While ac­knowl­edg­ing the im­por­tance of al­low­ing dif­fer­ent view­points to be heard, Dr Te­dros took is­sue with the opin­ions voiced by some that high death rates were not re­ally a con­cern if it is mainly the el­derly who are dy­ing.</p>
    <p>“Ac­cept­ing some­one to die be­cause of age is moral bank­ruptcy at its high­est, and we shouldn’t al­low our so­ci­ety to be­have this way.”</p>
    <p>Dr Te­dros also voiced un­der­stand­ing for the grow­ing frus­tra­tion felt by peo­ple as they con­tinue to have to deal with re­stric­tions eight months into the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The United Na­tions health agency, he stressed, “fully sup­ports ef­forts to re­open economies and so­ci­eties... but we want to see it done safely”.</p>
