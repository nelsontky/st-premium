    <p>The Ger­man city of Nurem­berg is throw­ing it­self into a mas­sive con­ser­va­tion ef­fort as it pre­pares to mark the 75th an­niver­sary of the post-war tri­als of Adolf Hitler’s hench­men</p>
    <p>NUREM­BERG (Ger­many) • When Nazi ru­ins be­gin to crum­ble, is it bet­ter for Ger­many to rip them down or re­store them?</p>
    <p>That is the ques­tion now fac­ing Nurem­berg, site of the in­fa­mous vast march­ing grounds and torch-lit pa­rades im­mor­talised by film-maker Leni Riefen­stahl.</p>
    <p>As it pre­pares to mark the 75th an­niver­sary of the post-war tri­als of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler’s top hench­men, the city has opted to throw it­self into a mas­sive con­ser­va­tion ef­fort tied to Ger­many’s vaunted cul­ture of re­mem­brance and atone­ment for past crimes.</p>
    <p>“This is where it all be­gan: the de­struc­tion, the ex­clu­sion and, in the end, the Holo­caust” in which the Nazis slaugh­tered six mil­lion Euro­pean Jews, Ms Ju­lia Lehner, the south­ern city’s chief cul­ture of­fi­cial, said.</p>
    <p>Tour­ing the sweep­ing Nazi party rally grounds, Ms Lehner pointed out the mas­sive Zep­pelin grand­stand where Hitler from 1933 to 1938 de­liv­ered racist tirades to half a mil­lion party faith­ful who gath­ered there ev­ery Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Tens of thou­sands more Ger­mans from across the coun­try joined in to wit­ness the gi­ant dance spec­ta­cles and colour guards. Nearby, another ruin looms.</p>
    <p>The clas­si­cal Congress Hall, never com­pleted, is the sec­ond largest Nazi-era build­ing still stand­ing, af­ter the Prora re­cre­ation com­plex on the Baltic Sea.</p>
    <p>Its “mon­u­men­tal­ity” was in­tended, like so many ar­chi­tec­tural relics from the era, to “in­tim­i­date and fas­ci­nate” while “demon­strat­ing the su­pe­ri­or­ity of Nazi ide­ol­ogy”, his­to­rian Wolf­gang Benz said.</p>
    <p>The site, largely de­signed by Hitler’s chief ar­chi­tect Albert Speer and oc­cu­py­ing 11 sq km, provides use­ful in­sights into “the per­se­cu­tors”, said Ms Lehner.</p>
    <p>She re­called that Hitler hand­picked Nurem­berg as the stag­ing ground for his so­phis­ti­cated pro­pa­ganda ma­chine.</p>
    <p>That was one of the prime rea­sons the Al­lies chose the city for the ground-break­ing hear­ings to pros­e­cute top Nazis from Novem­ber 1945.</p>
    <p>The dark her­itage weighed on the city for decades.</p>
    <p>“Im­me­di­ately af­ter the war, it was pre­ferred to cover it all with a veil of for­get­ting,” Ms Lehner said.</p>
    <p>Zep­pelin Field with its stone bleach­ers op­po­site the grand­stand were long used as sport­ing grounds for Amer­i­can sol­diers and, later, rock con­certs by the likes of singer Bob Dy­lan.</p>
    <p>To­day, what re­mains – of­fi­cially listed as a his­tor­i­cal mon­u­ment – is in a state of dan­ger­ous dis­re­pair.</p>
    <p>Many of the fa­mil­iar land­marks are in­ac­ces­si­ble due to the risk of crum­bling ed­i­fices in­jur­ing vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>The Congress Hall is closed to the pub­lic too. Its ground floor acts as a ware­house for the small huts that make up Nurem­berg’s world­fa­mous Christmas mar­ket, while an an­nexe is used for stor­age by the Phil­har­monic Orches­tra.</p>
    <p>Since 2001, a doc­u­men­ta­tion cen­tre on the side­lines of the grounds has served to pro­vide his­tor­i­cal con­text.</p>
    <p>Af­ter two decades of of­ten bit­ter de­bate, Nurem­berg de­cided to re­store the site by 2025, with the €85 mil­lion (S$135.5 mil­lion) cost shared by the city, the state of Bavaria and the fed­eral gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The sum will first and fore­most serve to pre­vent fur­ther struc­tural ero­sion of the build­ings.</p>
    <p>The field will be con­verted into a park and signs will ex­plain the his­tory and sig­nif­i­cance of each build­ing.</p>
    <p>The doc­u­men­ta­tion cen­tre, which wel­comes 300,000 vis­i­tors a year, will be ex­panded.</p>
    <p>It is about “mak­ing the stones speak”, Ms Lehner said, “by telling their his­tory and al­ways in­sist­ing that can­not be al­lowed to hap­pen again”.</p>
    <p>The Congress Hall is slated to even­tu­ally be­come a home to artists’ stu­dios.</p>
    <p>Nurem­berg’s Jewish com­mu­nity has em­braced the plans.</p>
    <p>“It’s a good ba­sis for show­ing peo­ple from around the world and young peo­ple... about the to­tal­i­tar­ian ide­ol­ogy th­ese build­ings in­car­nate,” its pres­i­dent, Mr Jo-Achim Ham­burger, said.</p>
