    <p>Con­struc­tion worker Ajith Ku­mar, 24, who re­sides in Sin­ga­pore’s largest for­eign worker dor­mi­tory, says con­di­tions have changed in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>His 8m by 6m room at Sungei Ten­gah Lodge (STL), which he shares with 11 oth­ers, is cleaner, with clean­ing sup­plies pro­vided.</p>
    <p>He uses an app on his mo­bile phone to scan a QR code near the room’s en­trance, to re­port his lo­ca­tion to the au­thor­i­ties twice daily.</p>
    <p>He hopes to be back at work soon, af­ter a lapse of four months.</p>
    <p>These are just a few changes among many made in the bat­tle against Covid-19 in the dorms since early April, when the first dorms were gazetted as iso­la­tion ar­eas.</p>
    <p>FOUR-MONTH BAT­TLE</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Sin­ga­pore fin­ished test­ing all 323,000 work­ers in dorms for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>A “mas­sive un­der­tak­ing”, as Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, co-chair of the multi-min­istry virus task force, said in a Facebook post.</p>
    <p>And as of Mon­day, some nine in 10 of these work­ers – or 273,000 – have re­cov­ered or been tested to be free of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The jour­ney to the cur­rent stage has taken four long and ar­du­ous months of many poli­cies and mea­sures im­ple­mented to meet a faste­volv­ing sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>A mi­cro­cosm of what has hap­pened can be found in STL, which went from be­ing one of the largest clus­ters to be­ing Covid-19-free last month.</p>
    <p>It was no mean feat to man­age the then 23,000 work­ers when the dorm was first gazetted as an iso­la­tion area in early April, said Mr Simon Lee, chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer of TG25, which runs STL.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing that pe­riod, I was hav­ing only two hours of sleep (a night) for eas­ily two weeks,” he said, adding that it was a “mad rush” to get all the work­ers to re­turn and stay in their rooms.</p>
    <p>An es­pe­cially chal­leng­ing task was cater­ing meals for ev­ery­one and main­tain­ing hy­giene and san­i­ta­tion, he added, re­call­ing “a lot of me­dia at­ten­tion” on the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>By this time, un­san­i­tary con­di­tions i n some dorms had been placed in the spot­light. A Straits Times re­port on April 6 on con­di­tions at S11 Dor­mi­tory @ Pung­gol de­scribed crowded rooms with cock­roaches and over­flow­ing toi­lets.</p>
    <p>To im­prove con­di­tions and man­age the sit­u­a­tion, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo an­nounced the de­ploy­ment of For­ward As­sur­ance and Sup­port Teams (Fast) – com­pris­ing Min­istry of Man­power (MOM), po­lice and mil­i­tary of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>Rig­or­ous hy­giene and san­i­ta­tion mea­sures were put in place, cater­ers were roped in to pro­vide work­ers with three meals a day, and med­i­cal posts were set up to test and treat those who felt un­well.</p>
    <p>Healthy work­ers in es­sen­tial ser­vices were trans­ferred to al­ter­na­tive sites like float­ing ho­tels and va­cant Hous­ing Board blocks, to sep­a­rate them from in­fected work­ers and re­duce work dis­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>In mid-May, Mr Wong an­nounced plans to test all 323,000 work­ers in dorms for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Deputy As­sis­tant Com­mis­sioner of Po­lice Shu Su Yen, who leads the 36-per­son Fast team at STL, said it worked with the dorm’s op­er­a­tor to keep track of each worker’s sta­tus.</p>
    <p>A team from the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal was on site for med­i­cal clear­ance.</p>
    <p>“Work­ing hand i n hand with these two part­ners on site helped us en­sure that no work­ers were left out of the test­ing,” she said.</p>
    <p>This paved the way for the dorm to be de-gazetted and cleared, block by block, of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>A SAFE RE­TURN TO WORK</p>
    <p>Although Mr Ajith and his room­mates have not been able to work for the last four months, they are the mi­nor­ity in STL. Close to 12,000 of about 19,000 work­ers now housed there – more than three in five – have gone back to work.</p>
    <p>Is­land­wide, about 265,000 work­ers in the con­struc­tion, marine and process sec­tors have been able to head back to work as of Thursday.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Wong said that the vast ma­jor­ity of mi­grant work­ers in the dorms would be able to re­sume work by the end of the month.</p>
    <p>“But our fight against the virus is not over. Just be­cause we have Covid-cleared dorms to­day doesn’t mean that we will au­to­mat­i­cally have Covid-safe dorms in the fu­ture,” he warned.</p>
    <p>In its lat­est up­date last night, the Health Min­istry an­nounced that four pre­vi­ous cases had been linked to form a new clus­ter at a dor­mi­tory at 66 Tech Park Cres­cent.</p>
    <p>Many mea­sures are in place to en­sure that work­ers re­sum­ing work do not spark new Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Work­ers, for ex­am­ple, have to use the FWMOMCare app, re­leased on May 18 by MOM, to re­port their health sta­tus and lo­ca­tion daily.</p>
    <p>Be­fore they can re­turn to work, em­ploy­ers have to ob­tain the rel­e­vant ap­provals from agen­cies, such as the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity.</p>
    <p>Only when all con­di­tions, in­clud­ing mea­sures such as stag­gered trans­port ar­range­ments, are met, will the worker be given a green Ac­cessCode – mean­ing he is cleared to re­turn to work.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers were gen­er­ally sup­port­ive of the mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Mr Nixon Loh, 48, gen­eral man­ager of Loh & Loh Con­struc­tion, said he has al­ways pro­vided trans­port for his work­ers, who are also is­sued pro­tec­tive equip­ment and hand sani­tiser when needed.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously now, there will be an in­crease in cost, which is un­avoid­able. The im­por­tant thing is that we get to re­sume our projects,” said Mr Loh, who has about 250 work­ers stay­ing in STL.</p>
    <p>Seven in 10 of his work­ers have the green Ac­cessCode.</p>
    <p>TG25’s Mr Lee said his dorm im­ple­ments checks at both the block and the exit to the dorm, where work­ers have to flash the green sta­tus on their phones’ SGWorkPass app be­fore they can leave.</p>
    <p>In the last three weeks, he has also been help­ing to co­hort work­ers, a mea­sure in­tro­duced to pre­vent cross-trans­mis­sions by hous­ing work­ers ac­cord­ing to their work sites. He has helped 87 firms co­hort more than 4,000 work­ers so far.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan Fang Qun, deputy com­man­der of the joint task force on dorms, said safe liv­ing mea­sures are key to the safe re­sump­tion of work.</p>
    <p>“Dorm op­er­a­tors have been work­ing very closely with em­ploy­ers, Fast teams and work­ers to put in place proper seg­re­ga­tion mea­sures,” he said, adding that these help to min­imise mix­ing be­tween work­ers of dif­fer­ent floors or blocks and re­duce po­ten­tial trans­mis­sions.</p>
    <p>Still, there will al­ways be the risk of in­fec­tions, es­pe­cially since some who get Covid-19 do not dis­play symp­toms.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan, who is direc­tor of plan­ning and or­gan­i­sa­tion de­vel­op­ment at MOM’s for­eign man­power man­age­ment divi­sion, said a 14-day rou­tine test­ing of all work­ers be­gins once a dorm is cleared.</p>
    <p>“So when we do dis­cover any in­fec­tion, we are able to move in quite quickly and con­tain and ar­rest the spread of the virus,” he said.</p>
    <p>If a case pops up, the au­thor­i­ties will act by as­sess­ing the ground sit­u­a­tion. If the dorm has proper en­force­ment of safe liv­ing mea­sures, fewer work­ers will need to be iso­lated.</p>
    <p>WHAT’S NEXT</p>
    <p>The work is not done and the goal is to fur­ther im­prove liv­ing con­di­tions of mi­grant work­ers, with a fur­ther re­duc­tion of the den­sity of work­ers in the dorms.</p>
    <p>MOM has been hold­ing con­sul­ta­tions with both op­er­a­tors and health ex­perts on quick-build dorms, to be ready by the end of the year. New spec­i­fi­ca­tions will en­sure each worker gets more liv­ing space, with less shar­ing of fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Other ar­range­ments in­clude fit­ting out for­mer schools and va­cant fac­to­ries to house work­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said more in­for­ma­tion on plans to re­duce worker den­sity in the dorms will be an­nounced in the com­ing weeks.</p>
    <p>An­other area of fo­cus is the emo­tional well-be­ing of work­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan out­lined ef­forts to step up com­mu­ni­ca­tion with work­ers and to work with non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions and worker am­bas­sadors.</p>
    <p>Since the start of the cri­sis, the wel­fare of work­ers and how to help them had been a top pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>Plans to pos­si­bly have stag­gered rest days when work­ers can leave their dorms for recre­ational pur­poses, and for more men­tal health sup­port, were re­vealed to ST on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>At STL, Mr Lee is al­ready work­ing with the Sal­va­tion Army to pro­vide coun­selling ser­vices for the work­ers, which started this month.</p>
    <p>DAC Shu also said that the med­i­cal post at STL looks out for any signs of de­pres­sion or in­som­nia, and the team works with mi­grant work­ers’ help group HealthServ­e to pro­vide men­tal health sup­port.</p>
    <p>As Mr Ajith and the over 300,000 oth­ers stay­ing in dorms re­turn to work in the com­ing weeks, these plans of­fer hope that, af­ter a long day of labour, they can re­turn to a more sup­port­ive and com­fort­able liv­ing en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>CON­TAIN­ING THE VIRUS</p>
    <p>When we do dis­cover any in­fec­tion, we are able to move in quite quickly and con­tain and ar­rest the spread of the virus.</p>
