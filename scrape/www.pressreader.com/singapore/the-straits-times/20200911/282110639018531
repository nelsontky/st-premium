    <p>The Singapore bourse con­tin­ued its down­ward tra­jec­tory yes­ter­day, with the key Straits Times In­dex clos­ing 7.24 points, or 0.29 per cent, lower at 2,492.09, unin­spired by Wall Street’s overnight bounce as tech’s three-day rout in the United States paused.</p>
    <p>Other key Asian eq­uity gauges ended mixed. Ja­pan, South Korea, Tai­wan and Aus­tralia posted gains, while China, Hong Kong and Malaysia closed in the red.</p>
    <p>The gains in US in­dexes aside, it is any­body’s guess how long the buy­ing in the beaten-down tech sec­tor will last. It is an un­cer­tainty that may be weigh­ing on traders’ minds.</p>
    <p>Ms Pan Jingyi, IG Singapore’s mar­ket strate­gist, said: “No doubt, it re­mains early stages to es­tab­lish a floor for the de­cline, with mo­men­tum still point­ing south. A fur­ther dip (below the 50-day mov­ing av­er­age)... could in­duce fresh con­cerns, but, for the time be­ing, prices may loi­ter in no man’s land.”</p>
    <p>The lo­cal bourse’s third straight day of de­cline comes ahead of US weekly jobless claims data, fol­lowed by to­day’s con­sumer price in­dex fig­ures and a pol­icy meet­ing by the Euro­pean Cen­tral Bank.</p>
    <p>Eyes are also on Brexit, fol­low­ing news that the Euro­pean Union is con­sid­er­ing le­gal ac­tion against Bri­tain over plans to breach the Brexit agree­ment.</p>
    <p>In the year to date, the STI has lost 23 per cent. The gains in the three bank­ing stocks – UOB, DBS and OCBC – yes­ter­day were un­able to keep the mar­ket’s barom­e­ter away from the neg­a­tive ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>Lead­ing the losses were Wil­mar In­ter­na­tional, Jar­dine Mathe­son, As­cen­das Reit and Singapore Ex­change.</p>
    <p>Trad­ing vol­ume on the Singapore mar­ket to­talled 1.58 bil­lion shares worth $1.16 bil­lion. Among the STI stocks, 11 coun­ters rose and 16 fell.</p>
    <p>Once again, Sem­b­corp Ma­rine and Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries drew ac­tive trad­ing. Sem­bMarine’s stock fell 4.2 per cent to 18.2 cents, with 91 mil­lion shares worth $17 mil­lion traded. Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries gained 1.7 per cent to $1.19, with 31 mil­lion shares worth $37 mil­lion chang­ing hands.</p>
    <p>The day’s big­gest win­ner was Sun­ning­dale Tech, which climbed 14.4 per cent to $1.43.</p>
    <p>The main­board-listed pre­ci­sion man­u­fac­turer said on Wed­nes­day that it had been ap­proached in re­la­tion to a pos­si­ble trans­ac­tion in­volv­ing its shares.</p>
    <p>AGV Group fell 4 per cent to 2.4 cents. Yes­ter­day morn­ing, the Catal­ist-listed firm, which pro­vides hot­dip gal­vanis­ing ser­vices to the steel and iron sec­tor, said its ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Al­bert Ang was re­sist­ing a call to step down amid a probe by Com­mer­cial Af­fairs Depart­ment.</p>
    <p>He has been on leave of ab­sence since Aug 7.</p>
