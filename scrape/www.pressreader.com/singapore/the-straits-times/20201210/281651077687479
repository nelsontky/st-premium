    <p>The roll-out of the Covid-19 vac­cine in the United States has started to take shape, with the army and lo­gis­tics giants primed to dis­trib­ute the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vac­cines as soon as fed­eral reg­u­la­tors give the green light.</p>
    <p>Both vac­cines are on the verge of reg­u­la­tory ap­proval.</p>
    <p>An in­de­pen­dent ad­vi­sory panel con­vened by the Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) ad­vi­sory com­mit­tee will meet to eval­u­ate the Pfizer vac­cine to­day and the Moderna vac­cine next Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The FDA will then de­cide whether to au­tho­rise the vac­cines for emer­gency use, which could take a few days to a few weeks af­ter the meet­ing.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­cans with pri­or­ity, like health­care work­ers and vul­ner­a­ble se­niors, could start re­ceiv­ing shots within days of that au­tho­ri­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The Pfizer vac­cine moved a step closer to ap­proval on Tues­day, as FDA sci­en­tists con­cluded in an anal­y­sis of clin­i­cal data that it “met the pre­scribed suc­cess cri­te­ria”.</p>
    <p>The her­culean task of vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion, which will take place over months on a rolling ba­sis as more doses be­come avail­able, will be one of the hard­est and most costly op­er­a­tional chal­lenges in the his­tory of Amer­ica, said Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at an event in which he un­veiled more of his Cab­i­net picks, Mr Bi­den promised “at least 100 mil­lion Covid-19 vac­cine shots into the arms of Amer­i­cans in 100 days”.</p>
    <p>Both Pfizer and Moderna vac­cines in­volve two doses three to four weeks apart, mean­ing that 100 mil­lion shots would cover 50 mil­lion peo­ple fully.</p>
    <p>The roll-out rep­re­sents light at the end of the tun­nel for a coun­try where over 284,000 peo­ple have died of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Tens of thou­sands more are likely to die in the com­ing months be­fore the vac­cine be­comes widely avail­able, as Amer­ica faces a surge in case num­bers and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said on Tues­day at a sum­mit on Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed, his ad­min­is­tra­tion’s part­ner­ship with pri­vate com­pa­nies to de­velop and dis­trib­ute Covid-19 vac­cines: “If au­tho­rised, tens of mil­lions of vac­cine doses will be avail­able this month... and hun­dreds of mil­lions more will quickly fol­low.”</p>
    <p>At the sum­mit, Mr Trump signed an ex­ec­u­tive or­der to en­sure that Amer­i­cans have pri­or­ity ac­cess to Covid-19 vac­cines de­vel­oped in the US, although the or­der did not ap­pear to have en­force­ment ac­tion.</p>
    <p>He also said he would in­voke the De­fence Pro­duc­tion Act, which would re­quire com­pa­nies to pri­ori­tise vac­cine doses for Amer­i­cans if needed, but added that he did not think it would be.</p>
    <p>His com­ments come amid news re­ports that the White House passed on a chance to se­cure mil­lions of ad­di­tional doses of the Pfizer vac­cine, which would likely have since been snapped up by other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>A gov­ern­ment spokesman said that it had five other vac­cine can­di­dates, in­clud­ing 100 mil­lion doses from Moderna.</p>
    <p>Vac­cine doses will be al­lo­cated to states, and gov­er­nors will de­cide how to pri­ori­tise the vac­cines for their state.</p>
    <p>The army will co­or­di­nate be­tween states and de­liv­ery com­pa­nies FedEx and UPS, and Amer­ica’s largest drug dis­trib­u­tor McKes­son. These com­pa­nies will trans­port the vac­cine doses across the coun­try to hos­pi­tals, clin­ics, phar­ma­cies, long-term care fa­cil­i­ties and other sites where they will be ad­min­is­tered.</p>
    <p>“Our goal is upon EUA – emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion – we will start mov­ing vac­cines within 24 hours,” said Gen­eral Gus­tave Perna, chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer of Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed, at the sum­mit.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery day, ev­ery week the vac­cine be­comes avail­able, al­lo­ca­tions will be pro­vided to the states, and we will start and we will ex­e­cute a con­sis­tent ca­dence of vac­cine de­liv­ery.”</p>
    <p>He added: “We will start to have shots in arms within 96 hours of EUA.”</p>
    <p>FedEx and UPS ex­ec­u­tives promised they had enough air cargo ca­pac­ity and ul­tra-low tem­per­a­ture stor­age fa­cil­i­ties to han­dle Covid-19 vac­cine de­liv­er­ies.</p>
    <p>CVS Health and Wal­greens phar­macy chains will play ma­jor roles in ad­min­is­ter­ing the vac­cine to Amer­i­cans in their on-site clin­ics, nurs­ing homes and else­where.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers at CVS can make an ap­point­ment on­line and come in at their sched­uled time for their vac­ci­na­tion, re­ceiv­ing re­minders and records by text and e-mail.</p>
    <p>“There’s no cost to the con­sumer. Ev­ery­one who wants a vac­cine should be able to get it,” said CVS Health ex­ec­u­tive vice-pres­i­dent Jonathan Roberts, adding that CVS will be able to ad­min­is­ter 25 mil­lion Covid-19 vac­cines each month.</p>
    <p>But re­newed vig­i­lance is re­quired as cases rise across Amer­ica, Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence said at the sum­mit.</p>
    <p>“We can see the light at the end of the tun­nel. But to reach the end of the tun­nel and to save Amer­i­can lives, we just need to re­dou­ble our ef­forts. We have a ways to go, Amer­ica,” he said.</p>
