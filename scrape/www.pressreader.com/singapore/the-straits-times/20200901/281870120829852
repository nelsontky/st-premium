    <p>WASHINGTON • The head of the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) has raised the pos­si­bil­ity that a fu­ture vac­cine against the coro­n­avirus might be given emergency ap­proval be­fore the end of tri­als de­signed to en­sure its safety and ef­fec­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>A re­quest for such ex­tra­or­di­nary ap­proval would have to come from the vac­cine de­vel­oper, Dr Stephen Hahn told the Fi­nan­cial Times in an in­ter­view pub­lished on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“If they do that be­fore the end of phase three”, which in­volves large-scale hu­man test­ing, “we may find that ap­pro­pri­ate”.</p>
    <p>But Dr Hahn in­sisted he was not act­ing un­der pres­sure from Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, who has been push­ing hard for a vac­cine, say­ing one might be ready be­fore US elec­tions on Nov 3. “This is go­ing to be a science, medicine, data de­ci­sion,” he said. “This is not go­ing to be a po­lit­i­cal de­ci­sion.”</p>
    <p>Three Western drug mak­ers are well along with their phase three clin­i­cal tri­als, in­volv­ing tens of thou­sands of par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>The three are As­traZeneca, which is part­ner­ing with Ox­ford Univer­sity in Eng­land; Moderna, which is col­lab­o­rat­ing with the US Na­tional In­sti­tutes of Health; and a Pfizer/BioNTech al­liance.</p>
    <p>By the na­ture of the tri­als it is dif­fi­cult to pre­dict when re­li­able re­sults will emerge. Half of the par­tic­i­pants in such tri­als re­ceive an ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cine, while the other half are given a placebo. Un­der nor­mal pro­ce­dures, test ad­min­is­tra­tors must wait – prob­a­bly for months – to see whether there is a sta­tis­ti­cally sig­nif­i­cant dif­fer­ence in the in­fec­tion rate of the two groups.</p>
    <p>As the world des­per­ately awaits an ef­fec­tive vac­cine against the deadly virus, China and Rus­sia have al­ready ap­proved vac­cines with­out wait­ing for the con­clu­sion of tri­als – draw­ing crit­i­cism from pub­lic health of­fi­cials in other coun­tries, in­clud­ing the US.</p>
    <p>Dr Hahn said an emergency au­tho­ri­sa­tion would not nec­es­sar­ily cover ev­ery­one – it might be granted for spe­cific, high-risk groups.</p>
    <p>The FDA chief has faced mount­ing crit­i­cism from the med­i­cal community that he has given in to po­lit­i­cal pres­sure from the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>In March, the FDA gave emergency au­tho­ri­sa­tion for the use of hy­drox­y­chloro­quine to treat Covid-19 af­ter Mr Trump re­peat­edly praised its use; the au­tho­ri­sa­tion was with­drawn in June af­ter se­ri­ous side ef­fects emerged. More re­cently, Dr Hahn gave a far too op­ti­mistic ap­praisal, dur­ing a news con­fer­ence with Mr Trump, of the ef­fec­tive­ness of con­va­les­cent plasma against the virus. He said it could save 35 out of 100 pa­tients; the more likely num­ber, experts said, is five in 100.</p>
