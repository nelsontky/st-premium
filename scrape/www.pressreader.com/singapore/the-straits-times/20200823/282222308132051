    <p>Over the past year, Mr Heng Li Seng, founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Green Nudge – a so­cial en­ter­prise that helps com­pa­nies re­duce the amount of waste gen­er­ated at events – has had a hand­ful of peo­ple ap­proach him for a green job.</p>
    <p>In re­cent months, with the eco­nomic fall­out from the Covid-19 pan­demic, the in­quiries have more than dou­bled.</p>
    <p>He now gets about one re­quest a month, in­clud­ing from for­eign­ers who want to re­lo­cate here and are ask­ing about the green jobs land­scape.</p>
    <p>It opened his eyes to the de­mand for green jobs, deal­ing with fields such as sus­tain­abil­ity and cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>“We re­alised that we could help the en­vi­ron­ment as well as al­low peo­ple to gain mean­ing­ful em­ploy­ment in this up-and-com­ing in­dus­try,” says Mr Heng, 32.</p>
    <p>Last month, he teamed up with space en­gi­neer Rusty Goh, 34, to launch Green Col­lar Ca­reers, a por­tal that matches j ob-seek­ers with jobs in the field of sus­tain­abil­ity. The j obs listed range from en­try-level ones to se­nior po­si­tions and is gain­ing trac­tion among the young.</p>
    <p>“Among the youth, there is a desire to do some­thing mean­ing­ful with their ca­reer, and not just work in any other job,” he says, adding that en­vi­ron­men­tal aware­ness and the “jour­ney to zero waste” have caught on in the last few years.</p>
    <p>The two founders, who met through a mu­tual friend, cu­rate the list­ings from job por­tals and also al­low user sub­mis­sions.</p>
    <p>Two weeks ago, they be­gan list­ing green jobs in Malaysia and in­tend to cover the rest of South­east Asia over the next two years.</p>
    <p>Their hope is to re­ha­bil­i­tate the im­age of a re­gion of­ten as­so­ci­ated with oil-palm plan­ta­tions and haze caused by il­le­gal agri­cul­tural fires.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh, who is based in Ber­lin, says the por­tal is their small con­tri­bu­tion to a greener world.</p>
    <p>De­spite re­cy­cling more ac­tively since he moved to Europe in 2018, he is con­scious of how much waste he gen­er­ates and en­ergy he con­sumes in daily life.</p>
    <p>He says: “Even though I’m not per­fect, I can be mind­ful of what I’m con­sum­ing every day and make an im­pact on the com­mu­nity through my ac­tions.”</p>
