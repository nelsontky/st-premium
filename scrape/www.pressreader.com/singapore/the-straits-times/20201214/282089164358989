    <p>The pre-school in New­ton that saw an out­break of sal­mo­nella and stom­ach flu has closed its kitchen tem­po­rar­ily as eight more chil­dren have fallen ill since last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>This brings the to­tal num­ber of in­fected chil­dren to 68, two of whom are hos­pi­talised, said Kid­di­winkie School­house @ New­ton in an email sent last Fri­day to par­ents and seen by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The pre-school added that 14 chil­dren are con­firmed to have sal­mo­nella in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 175 chil­dren are en­rolled at the pre-school.</p>
    <p>“We are tak­ing full re­spon­si­bil­ity in deal­ing with this is­sue,” said Kid­di­winkie School­house.</p>
    <p>With its kitchen cur­rently closed for deep clean­ing and sani­ti­sa­tion, the pre-school – which has re­mained open – has en­gaged JR Foods to pro­vide the chil­dren’s meals for the next few weeks.</p>
    <p>The cause of the out­break has yet to be de­ter­mined. Kid­di­winkie School­house said it ex­pects in­ves­ti­ga­tions by the au­thor­i­ties to con­clude by the end of this week.</p>
    <p>It is look­ing into the mat­ter separately while the Sin­ga­pore Food Agency con­ducts an in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>The pre-school first no­ti­fied par­ents last Mon­day about a spike in stom­ach flu cases among its pupils.</p>
    <p>Par­ents had ear­lier com­plained about the school’s tar­di­ness in dis­clos­ing the out­break and ex­pressed shock over the num­ber of chil­dren who have fallen ill.</p>
    <p>Eat­ing food con­tam­i­nated with the bac­terium Sal­mo­nella en­ter­i­tidis can cause food poi­son­ing, with symp­toms in­clud­ing di­ar­rhoea, fever, vom­it­ing and ab­dom­i­nal cramps. A sal­mo­nella in­fec­tion can be fa­tal for young chil­dren, the el­derly and those with im­paired im­mune sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Stom­ach flu, on the other hand, is caused by the norovirus, which in­flames the stom­ach and in­testines.</p>
    <p>Com­mon symp­toms in­clude di­ar­rhoea and vom­it­ing.</p>
    <p>The virus can be air­borne, mak­ing the in­fec­tion con­ta­gious. It can also spread through con­tam­i­nated food and wa­ter.</p>
