    <p>Hous­ing Board flat re­sale trans­ac­tions plunged in the sec­ond quar­ter of this year in the light of the cir­cuit breaker mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of re­sale trans­ac­tions fell by 41.9 per cent, from 5,893 flats sold in the first quar­ter to 3,426 flats in the sec­ond, ac­cord­ing to data from the HDB yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with the same pe­riod last year, re­sale trans­ac­tions in the sec­ond quar­ter of this year were 45.4 per cent lower.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, when strict safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures were put in place, lasted from April 7 to June 1.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that last quar­ter’s re­sale vol­ume was the low­est quar­ter sales on record since 2007, OrangeTee & Tie head of re­search and con­sul­tancy Christine Sun said the de­cline could be at­trib­uted to the tighter safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures im­posed dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, which pre­vented phys­i­cal house view­ings from be­ing car­ried out.</p>
    <p>“Even with the use of vir­tual home tours, aug­mented re­al­ity and e-open houses, some buy­ers face dif­fi­culty over­com­ing the psy­cho­log­i­cal bar­rier of seal­ing the deal with­out first in­spect­ing the unit in per­son.</p>
    <p>“Most buy­ers would still pre­fer to as­sess the con­di­tion of the flat and have a bet­ter vi­su­al­i­sa­tion of the unit lay­out be­fore mak­ing a pur­chase.”</p>
    <p>The prices of re­sale flats inched up slightly, with the re­sale price in­dex at 131.9, up 0.3 per cent from the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The prices rose marginally af­ter stay­ing flat in the first quar­ter of the year.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun called this sur­pris­ing, since the prices of re­sale flats fluc­tu­ated more dra­mat­i­cally in past crises.</p>
    <p>She listed as ex­am­ples the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis, when the HDB re­sale price in­dex plunged over nine suc­ces­sive quar­ters be­tween 1996 and 1999; the Sept 11, 2001 at­tacks, when prices fell for eight con­sec­u­tive quar­ters be­tween 2000 and 2002; and the 2008 global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, when prices slipped in 2009.</p>
    <p>“As of now, the four rounds of ag­gres­sive stim­u­lus pack­ages un­leashed by the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment seem ef­fec­tive in pre­vent­ing a hous­ing mar­ket melt­down or prop­erty price col­lapse. Cur­rently, prices of flats seemed to be hold­ing firm, with no ap­par­ent panic sell­ing is­land­wide,” she said.</p>
    <p>Over in the HDB rental mar­ket, trans­ac­tions also took a hit.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of ap­proved ap­pli­ca­tions to rent out HDB flats fell by 9.1 per cent, from 11,591 ap­pli­ca­tions in the first quar­ter of this year to 10,539 in the sec­ond.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with the same pe­riod last year, the num­ber of ap­proved ap­pli­ca­tions in the sec­ond quar­ter of this year was 14.6 per cent lower.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, as of the end of the sec­ond quar­ter, there were 57,693 HDB flats rented out, a 0.1 cent in­crease over the pre­vi­ous quar­ter, when there were 57,652 units rented out.</p>
    <p>The HDB said it will of­fer about 7,800 Build-To-Or­der flats in Ang Mo Kio, Bis­han, Choa Chu Kang, Gey­lang, Pasir Ris, Tampines, Ten­gah and Wood­lands next month.</p>
    <p>An­other 5,700 flats in Bis­han, Sem­bawang, Tampines, Ten­gah and Toa Payoh will be avail­able in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Of these, the flats in Choa Chu Kang, Tampines North and Ten­gah will have a shorter wait­ing time.</p>
    <p>Look­ing ahead, ERA Realty head of re­search and con­sul­tancy Nicholas Mak pre­dicts there could be more head­winds in the econ­omy and em­ploy­ment mar­ket lead­ing to lower HDB re­sale vol­ume.</p>
    <p>How­ever, this could be bal­anced out by the large num­ber of new flats that could en­ter the re­sale mar­ket, hav­ing reached the end of their five-year min­i­mum oc­cu­pa­tion pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“Some of these newer flats will be sold in the re­sale mar­ket at rel­a­tively higher prices than the older flats in the vicin­ity. Their trans­acted prices will con­trib­ute to the growth in the re­sale price in­dex,” he said.</p>
