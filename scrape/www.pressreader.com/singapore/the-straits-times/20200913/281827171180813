    <p>The wors­en­ing geopo­lit­i­cal cli­mate, driven by what Ja­pan per­ceives to be Chi­nese mil­i­tary ex­pan­sion­ism, is a ma­jor fac­tor be­hind Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe’s de­ci­sion to pave the way for the coun­try to ac­quire first-strike ca­pa­bil­i­ties, an­a­lysts here have said.</p>
    <p>The trig­ger for such dis­cus­sions, which also come as its se­cu­rity ally the United States presses it to do more in de­fence, is os­ten­si­bly the North Korean mis­sile threat.</p>
    <p>But China is the larger ele­phant in the room, and De­fence Min­is­ter Taro Kono last week ex­plic­itly sin­gled out Bei­jing as a “se­cu­rity threat”, strik­ing a far more hawk­ish tone than Tokyo’s erst­while typ­i­cal ex­pres­sions of “con­cern”.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe has stressed that any de­fence pol­icy will respect the paci­fist Con­sti­tu­tion’s bound­aries against launch­ing an un­pro­voked at­tack. The ar­gu­ment here is that a “first strike” is a de­fen­sive move made on an en­emy base to stop an im­pend­ing at­tack.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe ques­tioned if the cur­rent frame­work, un­der which Ja­pan in­ter­cepts mis­siles only af­ter they are launched, is suf­fi­cient to pro­tect the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Some an­a­lysts think he has a point. China and Rus­sia, both of which have ter­ri­to­rial dis­putes with Ja­pan, do not take too kindly to Tokyo’s se­cu­rity al­liance with Wash­ing­ton and have rapidly de­vel­oped mis­sile tech­nol­ogy that can evade radar sys­tems and de­stroy al­lied bases. And North Korea threat­ened to “sink” Ja­pan in 2017 as it lobbed mis­siles over Hokkaido into the Pa­cific Ocean.</p>
    <p>Dr Tosh Mi­no­hara, a se­cu­rity ex­pert at Kobe Univer­sity, told The Sun­day Times that the ram­rod­ding of a new “di­rec­tion”, even if not bind­ing on the new gov­ern­ment tak­ing over when Mr Abe steps down this week, ap­pears to be his way of “com­pen­sat­ing for not be­ing able to revise the Con­sti­tu­tion”.</p>
    <p>Dr Mi­no­hara sees such pre-emp­tive strike ca­pa­bil­i­ties as nec­es­sary amid ris­ing re­gional ten­sions, but did not think the pro­posal was han­dled well, say­ing: “It wor­ries me be­cause there is go­ing to be a lot of push­back do­mes­ti­cally.”</p>
    <p>The odds-on favourite to suc­ceed Mr Abe, Chief Cabi­net Sec­re­tary Yoshi­hide Suga, was also at the Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil meet­ing where the di­rec­tion was laid out and will see no rea­son not to heed a pro­posal set out by his pre­de­ces­sor and ally. But Univer­sity of Tokyo po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Yu Uchiyama, in ques­tion­ing the tim­ing, noted that it was un­com­mon for Ja­panese lead­ers to bind the next ad­min­is­tra­tion in such a man­ner.</p>
    <p>“This could be to en­sure there will not be any ma­jor change in mis­sile de­fence pol­icy,” he said. The plan prac­ti­cally ties the hands of the new leader into grow­ing the de­fence bud­get for new weapons sys­tems dur­ing a re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Still, Dr Mi­no­hara, who also chairs the Re­search In­sti­tute for Indo-Pa­cific Af­fairs think-tank, noted that Ja­pan’s de­fence moves will trig­ger a re­ac­tion from its po­ten­tial ad­ver­saries. “They will then develop and build even more and even bet­ter mis­siles, and so the cy­cle con­tin­ues. Will Ja­pan be able to play this game?” he asked.</p>
    <p>For­mer de­fence chief Shigeru Ishiba, who is also vy­ing to re­place Mr Abe, agrees on the need of pre-emp­tive strike ca­pa­bil­i­ties, but urged cau­tion and more dis­cus­sion.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause tech­nol­ogy has be­come far stealth­ier, and launch prepa­ra­tions much faster, than ever, he told a news con­fer­ence last Fri­day. Thus, it will be much more dif­fi­cult to de­tect an im­mi­nent at­tack, he said, and any wrong con­jec­ture would backfire on Ja­pan and lead to un­wanted ac­cu­sa­tions of it be­ing an ag­gres­sor.</p>
    <p>Still, the Yomi­uri daily, not­ing re­gional ten­sions, said in a re­cent ed­i­to­rial: “It is rea­son­able to have the op­tion of at­tack­ing an en­emy’s mis­sile site if Ja­pan is likely to suf­fer harm. The im­ple­men­ta­tion of self-de­fence mea­sures against a coun­try that ini­ti­ates an armed at­tack is in­ter­na­tion­ally ac­cepted.”</p>
    <p>It urged the gov­ern­ment to “steadily im­prove its de­fence ca­pa­bil­i­ties with­out be­ing bound by pre­con­ceived ideas”.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan is also strength­en­ing part­ner­ships in the re­gion. Last week, it signed a sig­nif­i­cant mil­i­tary sup­ply-shar­ing agree­ment with In­dia, which had deadly bor­der clashes with China re­cently.</p>
    <p>Dr Sa­toru Na­gao, a vis­it­ing fel­low at Hud­son In­sti­tute, said the pact strength­ens the Quad group of na­tions that in­cludes the US and Aus­tralia – all of which have similar bi­lat­eral agree­ments.</p>
    <p>“In­dia can ac­cess the bases of the US, Ja­pan (and) Aus­tralia, and share sup­plies with them. Even if In­dia is not di­rectly an ally of the US, it is no doubt that In­dia is a part of the US in­ner cir­cle,” he said.</p>
