    <p>There were 42 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,357, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said.</p>
    <p>Forty-one of the cases were asymp­to­matic. Nine in 10 of yes­ter­day’s cases are im­ported or linked to known cases, while the rest are pend­ing con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>Of the new cases, 10 were im­ported ones, and they were placed on stay-home no­tice upon ar­rival here.</p>
    <p>Two are Sin­ga­pore­ans, and five are per­ma­nent res­i­dents who re­turned to Sin­ga­pore from In­dia on Aug 30 and Aug 31.</p>
    <p>An­other two im­ported pa­tients are work pass hold­ers who ar­rived sep­a­rately from Ger­many on Aug 30 and the Philip­pines on Aug 29.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing case is a short­term visit pass holder who is the spouse of a Sin­ga­porean who ar­rived from In­dia on Sept 5.</p>
    <p>There were four com­mu­nity cases, com­pris­ing one per­ma­nent res­i­dent, one work pass holder and two work per­mit hold­ers, said MOH. All four were asymp­to­matic and de­tected through proac­tive test­ing.</p>
    <p>Case 57470 had been iden­ti­fied as a con­tact of a pre­vi­ously con­firmed case, and was placed on quar­an­tine ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Case 57463 was tested as part of ef­forts to screen in­di­vid­u­als work­ing in front-line Covid-19 op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, case 57461 was swabbed as part of MOH’s ac­tive case find­ing ef­forts.</p>
    <p>The last com­mu­nity in­fec­tion, case 57495, was de­tected as a result of MOH’s rou­tine test­ing of work­ers in the con­struc­tion, ma­rine and process sec­tors who are stay­ing out­side dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 28 new coro­n­avirus pa­tients con­firmed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Of the 28, 16 were iden­ti­fied as con­tacts of pre­vi­ous cases, and had al­ready been quar­an­tined to pre­vent fur­ther trans­mis­sion. They were tested dur­ing quar­an­tine to de­ter­mine if they had the virus.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing 12 cases were de­tected through sur­veil­lance test­ing, such as bi­weekly ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>One of the pa­tients stay­ing in dorms was from Avery Lodge Dor­mi­tory in Jurong – a clus­ter that now has 69 con­firmed cases. The dor­mi­tory was con­firmed as a new clus­ter on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Eleven were linked to the clus­ter at CDPL Tuas Dor­mi­tory, which now has 32 con­firmed cases.</p>
    <p>Five were linked to the clus­ter at Sungei Ten­gah Lodge, which now has 211 con­firmed cases.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from three cases a fort­night ago, to two in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has also de­creased from a daily av­er­age of two cases to one over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 92 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 56,684 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 54 pa­tients re­mained in hos­pi­tal yes­ter­day, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 577 were re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive died of other causes. Glob­ally, the virus out­break, which be­gan in De­cem­ber last year, has in­fected more than 28.6 mil­lion peo­ple. More than 919,000 peo­ple have died.</p>
