    <p>Aus­tralia came tan­ta­lis­ingly close to elim­i­nat­ing its Covid-19 out­break last month, but is now reim­pos­ing re­stric­tions as it bat­tles out­breaks in its two largest cities.</p>
    <p>The ex­pe­ri­ence has cre­ated a fierce di­vide in Aus­tralia over whether to try to sup­press or elim­i­nate the virus.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral gov­ern­ment in­sists on “ag­gres­sive sup­pres­sion”, say­ing that elim­i­na­tion is too costly and would lead to hun­dreds of thou­sands of ex­tra job losses.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son said an elim­i­na­tion strat­egy is also po­ten­tially more dan­ger­ous be­cause it can lead to a false sense of se­cu­rity about the on­go­ing risks of an out­break, par­tic­u­larly from re­turn­ing cit­i­zens un­der quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple be­come even more com­pla­cent, and so it is a very risky strat­egy and one that can be very il­lu­sory,” he said.</p>
    <p>“If you get to elim­i­na­tion as a re­sult of this process, well and good... But you can’t mort­gage off your econ­omy for what would prove to be a very il­lu­sory goal.”</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing a se­ri­ous na­tion­wide out­break in March, states and ter­ri­to­ries in­tro­duced strict lock­downs and bor­der clo­sures. But they be­gan to re­move the re­stric­tions as new cases quickly de­clined.</p>
    <p>By early last month, Aus­tralia had fewer than 10 new cases a day, and al­most all in­volved Aus­tralian cit­i­zens and res­i­dents who had re­turned from over­seas and were un­der quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>But case num­bers have since surged fol­low­ing an out­break in Mel­bourne, which is be­lieved to have be­gun with in­fec­tions of se­cu­rity guards at quar­an­tine ho­tels.</p>
    <p>Two weeks ago, Mel­bourne went into a new six-week lock­down. But its out­break has con­tin­ued to worsen, with the state post­ing a record 484 cases yesterday.</p>
    <p>The Mel­bourne out­break has spread to New South Wales (NSW), which has had an av­er­age of 14 daily cases in the past week. Most have in­volved com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion in Syd­ney, prompt­ing the state gov­ern­ment to reim­pose lim­ited re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>As of to­mor­row, group book­ings at restau­rants, bars and cafes will be lim­ited to 10 peo­ple, from 20 pre­vi­ously. Venues must also have a reg­is­tered safety plan cov­er­ing hy­giene, phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing and record­ing of con­tact de­tails of staff and cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>But the re­newed out­breaks in Vic­to­ria and NSW have prompted grow­ing calls for Aus­tralia to pur­sue a plan to com­pletely erad­i­cate the virus. This would po­ten­tially in­volve strict lock­downs in af­fected ar­eas that would con­tinue be­yond the end of all ob­served lo­cal trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral pub­lic health experts have said they have changed their minds, and they be­lieve the data on Covid-19 out­breaks in Aus­tralia and around the world has shown that elim­i­na­tion is pos­si­ble in spe­cific geo­graphic ar­eas.</p>
    <p>New Zealand, for in­stance, pur­sued an elim­i­na­tion strat­egy with one of the world’s strictest lock­downs. There has been no com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion of the virus in more than 80 days.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness groups in Aus­tralia have op­posed a fur­ther strict lock­down, say­ing it will be too dam­ag­ing and will pre­vent some busi­nesses from ever re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>How­ever, some econ­o­mists have be­gun back­ing calls for an elim­i­na­tion strat­egy, say­ing the sup­pres­sion model leads to un­cer­tainty and risks mul­ti­ple fu­ture lock­downs.</p>
    <p>Ms Danielle Wood, chief ex­ec­u­tive of think-tank Grat­tan In­sti­tute, said pur­su­ing elim­i­na­tion, which has oc­curred in states such as West­ern Aus­tralia, has ad­van­tages and en­ables a com­plete re­open­ing of the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“The sec­ond wave in Vic­to­ria re­ally high­lights the po­ten­tial costs of a sup­pres­sion strat­egy,” she told ABC News. “While ever that virus is cir­cu­lat­ing at low lev­els in the com­mu­nity, there’s a risk of a sec­ond wave, and that comes at a very sig­nif­i­cant cost.”</p>
