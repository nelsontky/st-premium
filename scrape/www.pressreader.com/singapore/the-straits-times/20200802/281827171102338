    <p>De­spite be­ing awarded dam­ages of $445,000 against the elec­tric scooter rider who crashed into his wife, there is lit­tle guar­an­tee Mr Leong Loon Wah will ac­tu­ally get the money.</p>
    <p>The e-scooter rider is 21-year-old na­tional ser­vice­man Ni­cholas Ting Nai Jie, who says he is un­able to pay be­cause he has no as­sets and was not cov­ered by in­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>When asked if Mr Ting would con­sider ne­go­ti­at­ing the court-or­dered sum down, his lawyer S. Sel­varaj told The Sun­day Times that even if the sum were halved, his client would still be un­able to afford it.</p>
    <p>“There is no point mak­ing him bank­rupt at 21. He has no as­sets and we can­not pre­dict how much he will earn in the fu­ture,” said Mr Sel­varaj, who is from law firm My­in­tSoe & Sel­varaj.</p>
    <p>“Before pro­ceed­ing to sue some­one, the plain­tiff should have con­sid­ered how much (Mr Ting) has.”</p>
    <p>Since the ac­ci­dent in Septem­ber 2016, the vic­tim – house­wife Ang Liu Kiow, 57 – has been un­able to speak, read or write and needs help with eat­ing, dress­ing and us­ing the bath­room.</p>
    <p>She and her hus­band Mr Leong are rep­re­sented by lawyer Bene­dict Teo from Drew & Napier. Mr Teo is act­ing on a pro bono ba­sis for the fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing through his lawyers, Mr Leong, a con­tract worker mak­ing $2,000 to $3,000 a month, told The Sun­day Times that more than $60,000 has been spent on Madam Ang’s med­i­cal bills and the costs are in­creas­ing. Hir­ing a do­mes­tic worker has also added to their fi­nan­cial bur­den.</p>
    <p>“Based on the doc­tors’ as­sess­ment, (Madam Ang’s) dis­abil­i­ties will al­ways re­main as she has reached the func­tional end of her in­cre­men­tal re­cov­ery,” he said.</p>
    <p>The fa­ther of three chil­dren aged 20, 26 and 30 is not giv­ing up. The 57-year-old says he will ex­plore other le­gal op­tions, in­clud­ing tak­ing Mr Ting to court to de­ter­mine his as­sets or start bank­ruptcy pro­ceed­ings against him.</p>
    <p>Personal mo­bil­ity de­vice (PMD) rid­ers are not legally re­quired to be in­sured and cases like this one show that this needs to change, said ob­servers.</p>
    <p>There are al­ready sev­eral in­sur­ance op­tions for PMD rid­ers, with one as low as $65 a year.</p>
    <p>Mr Ho Kai Weng, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Gen­eral In­sur­ance As­so­ci­a­tion (GIA) of Sin­ga­pore, said: “This law­suit shows clearly that the cost of in­sur­ance is far less than the cost of be­ing unin­sured.”</p>
    <p>The ac­ci­dent in­volv­ing Madam Ang was one of many dur­ing the height of PMDs’ pop­u­lar­ity sev­eral years ago, when the de­vices were seen as a way to help com­muters make the first- and last-mile seg­ments of their jour­neys.</p>
    <p>But as ac­ci­dents in­creased, the au­thor­i­ties started with get­ting users to reg­is­ter their e-scoot­ers before ban­ning them from pub­lic foot­paths. In the sec­ond half of this year, busi­nesses that use PMDs on pub­lic paths, such as food delivery firms, will have to cover their rid­ers with third-party li­a­bil­ity in­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary, then Senior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port Janil Puthuc­heary told Par­lia­ment that the Trans­port Min­istry was work­ing with the Ac­tive Mo­bil­ity Ad­vi­sory Panel (AMAP) and in­sur­ers to see how to ex­tend in­sur­ance to individual rid­ers. There have been no updates since then.</p>
    <p>Un­til such mea­sures are rolled out, lawyers whom The Sun­day Times spoke to said that in cases like Madam Ang’s, there is lit­tle the fam­ily can do to re­ceive the com­pen­sa­tion due.</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing Madam Ang’s case as un­for­tu­nate, vet­eran lawyer Amolat Singh of Amolat & Part­ners said: “It is a hole in the sys­tem be­cause we get cases like this where peo­ple have been hurt in ac­ci­dents and there is not much that can be done if they can­not afford to pay and don’t have in­sur­ance cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>“(But) if we ask ev­ery­one to be in­sured for ev­ery­thing, like rid­ing a bi­cy­cle or even roller skat­ing, things will slow to a halt.”</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, lawyer Amar­ick Gill said: “The fam­ily can com­mence civil pro­ceed­ings against the rider to get a judgment but at the end of the day, this is a tragedy. If he has no as­sets, the fam­ily will not be able to re­cover any of the money at all.</p>
    <p>“Such PMDs should have in­sur­ance cov­er­age to pre­vent fu­ture mishaps.”</p>
    <p>In the 2016 ac­ci­dent, Madam Ang was run­ning er­rands in Pasir Ris and as she stepped onto the foot­path by a bus stop, she was hit by the elec­tric scooter. She fell, hit her head on the ground and later un­der­went emer­gency surgery for bleed­ing in her brain. In 2018, Mr Ting pleaded guilty to caus­ing griev­ous hurt by a neg­li­gent act and served a short de­ten­tion or­der of two weeks.</p>
    <p>PMD en­thu­si­asts The Sun­day Times spoke to ar­gue that while in­sur­ance plans can help in some cases, they do not solve the root prob­lem of PMD-re­lated ac­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>Mr De­nis Koh, a for­mer AMAP mem­ber and chair­man of the PMD en­thu­si­ast group Big Wheel Scoot­ers Sin­ga­pore, said: “The pri­or­ity should al­ways be preven­tion. This leans to­wards ed­u­ca­tion, to mould the com­mu­nity to­wards a more gra­cious cul­ture to share the space har­mo­niously.</p>
    <p>“The in­sis­tence of just PMD in­sur­ance alone should not be seen as the sole so­lu­tion, but it will have to kick in as part of the repa­ra­tion process if some­one does get in­jured.”</p>
    <p>Mr Fran­cis Chu, the co-founder of cy­cling group Love Cy­cling SG who pre­vi­ously sat on the AMAP, ar­gued that hav­ing in­sur­ance as a shield may even cause reck­less­ness on the roads.</p>
    <p>“I feel (be­ing unin­sured) has a big­ger deter­rent im­pact and in­duces more care­ful be­hav­iour when rid­ing,” he said, sug­gest­ing crowd fund­ing as a pos­si­ble op­tion for Mr Ting to pay the dam­ages he owes.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong said he is dis­ap­pointed by Mr Ting’s re­fusal to pay any sum what­so­ever. “I still get up­set when I think of my wife’s cur­rent con­di­tion. How­ever, I refuse to lose hope and am de­ter­mined to con­tinue car­ing for her.”</p>
    <p>UN­FOR­TU­NATE CASE</p>
    <p>It is a hole in the sys­tem be­cause we get cases like this where peo­ple have been hurt in ac­ci­dents and there is not much that can be done if they can­not afford to pay and don’t ’’ have in­sur­ance cov­er­age.
