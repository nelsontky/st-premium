    <p>If you walk along Buf­falo Road in Lit­tle In­dia, you will no­tice a new statue of a man wear­ing a loose head­dress con­fi­dently sit­ting in a bul­lock cart.</p>
    <p>It was un­veiled on Mon­day to re­call the his­tory of cat­tle trad­ing and the use of bul­lock carts in the area. Bul­lock carts tra­versed Sin­ga­pore’s streets un­til the mid-20th cen­tury and are closely tied to the her­itage of Lit­tle In­dia and Seran­goon.</p>
    <p>Buf­falo Road and its sur­round­ings were known for cat­tle trad­ing in the 19th and 20th cen­turies.</p>
    <p>The statue, made of fi­bre­glass­re­in­forced poly­mar­ble with faux brass coat­ing, is lo­cated at the in­ter­sec­tion of Buf­falo Road and Seran­goon Road and stands next to Hous­ing Board Block 663 Buf­falo Road.</p>
    <p>The Tan­jong Pa­gar Town Coun­cil, which spear­headed the ini­tia­tive with the Tekka Res­i­dents’ Com­mit­tee to add vi­brancy to the neigh­bour­hood, said the project was in­spired by the rich his­tory and back­ground of Lit­tle In­dia.</p>
    <p>“We chose to fea­ture the bul­lock cart at the her­itage park as it is sit­u­ated in front of a busy traf­fic junc­tion with high pedes­trian traf­fic,” said a town coun­cil spokesman.</p>
    <p>“The statue is not mod­elled af­ter any­one; it pays homage to the his­tory of cat­tle trad­ing and the use of bul­lock carts in the past in this area.”</p>
    <p>The statue is sur­rounded by a gallery of eight pan­els de­scrib­ing the 200-year his­tory of the area. They have in­for­ma­tion on mu­nic­i­pal and pri­vate hous­ing, de­signs of shop­houses, early in­dus­tries, mean­ings be­hind street names, and nearby her­itage sites like Gandhi Memo­rial Hall.</p>
    <p>“The statue and gallery en­able us to rec­ol­lect mem­o­ries of the growth of our com­mu­nity and the rich­ness of our his­tory,” said Lit­tle In­dia Shop­keep­ers’ and Her­itage As­so­ci­a­tion’s hon­orary sec­re­tary Ruthi­ra­p­a­thy Parthasara­thy.</p>
    <p>“This in­for­ma­tion will surely ben­e­fit tourists and young peo­ple who may not know the his­tory of this area.”</p>
    <p>The town coun­cil spokesman said work on other projects in the neigh­bour­hood is con­tin­u­ing and these are ex­pected to be com­pleted by the first quar­ter of next year.</p>
