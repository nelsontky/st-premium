    <p>Sci­en­tists here say that de­spite the re­cent rise in the num­ber of rapid Covid-19 tests avail­able on the mar­ket, con­ven­tional poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) tests are likely to re­main in use at least for the near fu­ture as they com­ple­ment each other.</p>
    <p>On Oct 20, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) an­nounced that par­tic­i­pants in some mass events would have to take an anti­gen rapid test (ART) and ob­tain a neg­a­tive re­sult be­fore be­ing ad­mit­ted, un­der a new pi­lot pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>And on Oct 29, Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) spin-off Breathonix said it was in dis­cus­sions with MOH to de­ploy breathal­yser-type tests in tri­als at pub­lic lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Those tak­ing a con­ven­tional PCR test usu­ally have to wait a day or two for their re­sults. In con­trast, ARTs re­turn re­sults in about 30 min­utes, while the breathal­yser-type test does so in un­der a minute.</p>
    <p>The ART and breathal­yser-type test are less ac­cu­rate than a PCR one. The PCR test has been de­scribed as the “gold stan­dard” of Covid-19 de­tec­tion dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But ex­perts say rapid tests cer­tainly have a role to play.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Alex Cook, vice-dean of re­search at NUS’ Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said that fre­quent test­ing us­ing a less sen­si­tive test, such as a rapid test, will prob­a­bly pick up more in­fec­tions than in­fre­quent test­ing with a more sen­si­tive test like PCR .</p>
    <p>“We could po­ten­tially re­duce the length of quar­an­tine for in­com­ing trav­ellers by test­ing them fre­quently with rapid tests, rather than giv­ing them a sin­gle exit test af­ter two weeks,” he told The Straits Times last week.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Hsu Li Yang, who is also from NUS’ Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, pointed out that more fre­quent test­ing cre­ates more op­por­tu­ni­ties to de­tect the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Prof Hsu, who is vice-dean of global health and leader of the in­fec­tious dis­eases pro­gramme, added: “In a sit­u­a­tion where you need re­sults in a hurry, (like) an hour or two be­fore a mass event, you wouldn’t be able to get a PCR re­sult at all – hence the need for th­ese rapid tests.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher from the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine noted that lab­o­ra­to­ries may be hard to ac­cess in some coun­tries, mak­ing point-of-care rapid tests a use­ful al­ter­na­tive, as they do not re­quire a lab.</p>
    <p>But Prof Hsu em­pha­sised that more fre­quent test­ing with a rapid test can­not en­tirely re­place PCR tests, as the for­mer has its draw­backs.</p>
    <p>“More fre­quent test­ing in­creases the like­li­hood of a false­pos­i­tive re­sult for tests that are less spe­cific, in­creases in­con­ve­nience for those tak­ing the tests, and also in­creases the costs as com­pared to do­ing the tests less fre­quently,” he said.</p>
    <p>The speci­ficity of a test refers to its abil­ity to cor­rectly i den­tify those with­out the dis­ease, while the sen­si­tiv­ity of a test refers to its abil­ity to cor­rectly iden­tify those with the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, PCR tests re­main the most sen­si­tive form of test­ing for Covid-19, said Prof Hsu. “There­fore in un­cer­tain clin­i­cal sit­u­a­tions, es­pe­cially (with) hos­pi­talised pa­tients, th­ese would still re­main the pre­ferred tests,” he said.</p>
    <p>Prof Cook agreed, say­ing that un­til rapid tests are able to match the ac­cu­racy of PCR tests, the lat­ter will still be the test needed for clin­i­cal con­fir­ma­tion of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>MOH had said in Oc­to­ber that those who test pos­i­tive through an ART dur­ing the pre-event swab­bing pi­lot need to get a PCR test done to con­firm the re­sults.</p>
    <p>Prof Hsu noted that Sin­ga­pore has been able to get to phase two of its reopen­ing us­ing PCR tests alone, and can achieve phase three us­ing the same.</p>
    <p>But he added that the avail­abil­ity of rapid tests might al­low for greater re­as­sur­ance and safety when used for pre-en­try screening for mass events where hun­dreds min­gle to­gether, al­though this would come at the lo­gis­ti­cal costs of set­ting up the screening area, as well as hav­ing to deal with the oc­ca­sional false-pos­i­tive test re­sult.</p>
    <p>Prof Cook said: “It’s horses for cour­ses. Fast tests like anti­gen have a dif­fer­ent role than do PCR tests, and both roles are im­por­tant in our re­sponse. PCR tests are go­ing to re­main the gold stan­dard for clin­i­cal di­ag­no­sis, I’m sure, but the rapid tests al­low dif­fer­ent kinds of test­ing.”</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, he pointed out that rapid tests are al­ready be­ing used on cruises to nowhere to test pas­sen­gers prior to em­bark­ing.</p>
    <p>“This is far more prac­ti­cal than hav­ing pas­sen­gers go to a clinic a few days be­fore for a PCR test, and re­duces the risk of in­ter­val in­fec­tions slip­ping through... th­ese be­ing in­fec­tions any time from a lit­tle while be­fore go­ing for the PCR test to board­ing the ship, which will clearly not be iden­ti­fied by a PCR test,” said Prof Cook.</p>
    <p>Prof Fisher said: “Dif­fer­ent tests al­low us to tai­lor ef­forts to the con­text. In some sit­u­a­tions speed may be more im­por­tant, (while) in oth­ers it will be ac­cu­racy.”</p>
