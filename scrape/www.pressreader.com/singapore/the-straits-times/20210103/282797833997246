    <p>It is less than three months since the last spend­ing spree fin­ished. When it did, Premier League clubs had spent £1.26 bil­lion</p>
    <p>(S$2.24 bil­lion); more than their Span­ish, Ger­man and French coun­ter­parts com­bined and an amount that ap­peared ob­scene in the worst re­ces­sion for 300 years.</p>
    <p>That sum forms the back­drop to this month’s trans­fer win­dow, but there are other rel­e­vant numbers: the thou­sands of empty seats at grounds ev­ery week. With fans kept away and clubs bleed­ing money even the Premier League surely can­not carry on spend­ing, even if that was said last sum­mer.</p>
    <p>So when as­sess­ing the big clubs’ deal­ings, it is worth sep­a­rat­ing dream sign­ings from re­al­ity, and not merely be­cause rel­a­tively few ma­jor moves hap­pen in the win­ter win­dow.</p>
    <p>Er­ling Braut Haa­land would be ideal for Manch­ester City, but Pep Guardi­ola has said he will not sign a striker in Jan­uary. Jadon San­cho re­mains Manch­ester United’s per­fect re­cruit, and there is still a va­cancy on the right wing, but Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer’s im­me­di­ate ad­di­tion on the flanks will be the young Ivo­rian Amad Diallo, whose ar­rival from Ata­lanta was ar­ranged in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>De­clan Rice was the one A-lis­ter on Chelsea’s sum­mer wish list to evade them but West Ham will not coun­te­nance a Jan­uary sale. Talk of Kylian Mbappe and Liver­pool or Lionel Messi and City now is far-fetched.</p>
    <p>It means like­lier deals should be cheaper and dic­tated by ne­ces­sity. Per­haps eight clubs could see a Cham­pi­ons League place as grounds to spec­u­late in a bid to ac­cu­mu­late.</p>
    <p>But, fur­nished with six new</p>
    <p>Jur­gen Klopp has an ob­sti­nacy, an ad­mirable de­ter­mi­na­tion to trust those he al­ready has, a dis­like of the English ob­ses­sion with trans­fers and a re­luc­tance to com­pro­mise if he can­not get his main tar­gets.</p>
    <p>play­ers in the sum­mer, Jose Mour­inho can hardly ar­gue he needs more for Tot­ten­ham’s ti­tle push. Yet RB Leipzig cap­tain Mar­cel Sab­itzer is of interest in mid­field; per­haps Dele Alli’s po­ten­tial exit could help fa­cil­i­tate a move.</p>
    <p>As tech­ni­cal di­rec­tor Edu has ad­mit­ted, Arse­nal have a still greater re­quire­ment for a cre­ative mid­fielder to in­ject in­ven­tion into a ster­ile side. But, with a crip­pling wage bill, a need to get rid of</p>
    <p>play­ers and af­ter pay­ing out</p>
    <p>£77 mil­lion in the sum­mer, whether they can af­ford a high-class one is a moot point.</p>
    <p>Lyon’s Houssem Aouar was wanted three months ago and Borus­sia Dort­mund’s Ju­lian Brandt could be an al­ter­na­tive but a loan for Real Madrid’s Isco would be cheaper. United’s mid­field ad­di­tion could be the Ecuado­rian prodigy Moises Caicedo, but he would be a fu­tur­is­tic sign­ing.</p>
    <p>Para­dox­i­cally, the club with the</p>
    <p>great­est im­me­di­ate need for a sign­ing are the one in the best po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool top the league de­spite a lack of se­nior spe­cial­ist cen­tre-backs, with Vir­gil van Dijk and Joe Gomez long-term ab­sen­tees and Joel Matip in­jury-prone.</p>
    <p>Jur­gen Klopp has an ob­sti­nacy, an ad­mirable de­ter­mi­na­tion to trust those he al­ready has, a dis­like of the English ob­ses­sion with trans­fers and a re­luc­tance to</p>
    <p>com­pro­mise if he can­not get his main tar­gets.</p>
    <p>Brighton’s Ben White has at­tracted Liver­pool’s interest be­fore and Leipzig’s Dayot Upame­cano rep­re­sents the most cov­eted young cen­tre-back around.</p>
    <p>The Reds may have to ad­vance some of their sum­mer bud­get if they think they can get ei­ther or some­one suit­ably sim­i­lar. Their chances of re­tain­ing the ti­tle could de­pend upon it.</p>
