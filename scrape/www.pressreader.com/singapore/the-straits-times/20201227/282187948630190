    <p>EUGENE TAN, 48 Di­rec­tor of the Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore Art Mu­seum</p>
    <p>Some 90,000 peo­ple have seen art by more than 170 artists at 11 in­sti­tu­tions over the past five months un­der an ini­tia­tive spear­headed by the Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore (NGS) and Sin­ga­pore Art Mu­seum (SAM).</p>
    <p>In terms of ac­cess and im­pact, Pro­pos­als For Novel Ways Of Be­ing was un­doubt­edly the big­gest vis­ual arts event of a dis­rup­tive pan­demic year that saw art fair post­pone­ments and venue clo­sures.</p>
    <p>For the two in­sti­tu­tions’ lead­er­ship role in this ini­tia­tive, Dr Eugene Tan, di­rec­tor of NGS and SAM, is in Life’s Power List again, for the sev­enth time in his ca­reer.</p>
    <p>The 48-year-old is quick to em­pha­sise that Pro­pos­als is a team ef­fort in­volv­ing 12 venues, in­clud­ing Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s (NTU) ADM Gallery; Coda</p>
    <p>Cul­ture; Grey Projects; In­ter­mis­sion; Lasalle’s In­sti­tute of Con­tem­po­rary Arts Sin­ga­pore; Na­tional Mu­seum of Sin­ga­pore; NTU Cen­tre for Con­tem­po­rary Art Sin­ga­pore; soft/wall/studs; STPI; and The Sub­sta­tion.</p>
    <p>Pro­pos­als, he says, “rep­re­sents a united re­sponse from the vis­ual arts com­mu­nity to the changes brought about by the Covid-19 pan­demic, and em­bod­ies a col­lec­tive ef­fort to stand in sol­i­dar­ity with the lo­cal arts com­mu­nity, and the Sin­ga­pore com­mu­nity at large”.</p>
    <p>Work­ing on this mas­sive pro­gramme has “high­lighted the col­lec­tive re­spon­si­bil­ity that art in­sti­tu­tions, such as the gallery, SAM and our fel­low in­sti­tu­tional part­ners and art spa­ces, have in sus­tain­ing and grow­ing the lo­cal arts ecol­ogy i n our dif­fer­ent ways”, he adds.</p>
    <p>“The en­thu­si­asm and open­ness of all the other or­gan­i­sa­tions and artist groups to col­lab­o­rate was ex­tremely en­cour­ag­ing, and the suc­cess of the ini­tia­tive was en­tirely de­pen­dent on the col­le­gial­ity, en­ergy and in­spi­ra­tion of all the par­tic­i­pants.”</p>
    <p>There are no plans to ex­tend the six-month ini­tia­tive af­ter the last show, ADM’s In Our Best In­ter­est: Afro-South­east Asian Affini­ties Dur­ing A Cold War, runs from Jan 21 to March 27.</p>
    <p>But NGS and SAM have learnt from this ex­pe­ri­ence and it will in­form the in­sti­tu­tions’ pro­gram­ming for the fu­ture, “in terms of how we work with the lo­cal art com­mu­nity and arts ecol­ogy to grow the aware­ness and un­der­stand­ing of art’s role and agency among our publics in Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan says: “This ini­tia­tive has demon­strated an ea­ger­ness to col­lab­o­rate across the board, as well as the im­por­tance of large in­sti­tu­tions con­nect­ing more deeply with our lo­cal scene.</p>
    <p>“Given the changes we are all fac­ing, the need to be more re­spon­sive, open and net­worked has be­come clearer, and this will have an im­pact on how we work and the pro­gram­ming that we un­der­take from here on.”</p>
