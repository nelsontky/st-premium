    <p>Dengue cases fell by more than 20 per cent last week, but weekly num­bers re­main high, the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) warned yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It said more than 600,000 house­holds are lo­cated in over 390 dengue clus­ters is­land­wide.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is in the midst of the tra­di­tional dengue sea­son from May to Oc­to­ber and the agency is work­ing with all town coun­cils – as well as nu­mer­ous other stake­hold­ers – to curb the spread of dengue in the com­ing fort­night.</p>
    <p>This “in­ten­sive” two-week is­land­wide ex­er­cise comes as the num­ber of dengue cases this year reached a record high.</p>
    <p>In what looks to be the coun­try’s worst out­break in his­tory, 22,403 peo­ple have con­tracted dengue as of Tues­day, sur­pass­ing the pre­vi­ous full-year high of 22,170 in 2013.</p>
    <p>As of Sun­day, 20 peo­ple have died from the dis­ease, match­ing 2019’s full-year count of 20. The high­est full-year fa­tal­ity count to date is in 2005, when 25 peo­ple died.</p>
    <p>The NEA called on all res­i­dents to co­op­er­ate, urg­ing those in hot spots in par­tic­u­lar to per­form three pro­tec­tive ac­tions.</p>
    <p>These are: Spray in­sec­ti­cide in dark cor­ners around the house, ap­ply in­sect re­pel­lent reg­u­larly, and wear long sleeves and long pants.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents should also co­op­er­ate with NEA of­fi­cers do­ing in­spec­tion rounds, as well as check for and get rid of stag­nant water in their homes at least once a week.</p>
    <p>NEA chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Tan Meng Dui said: “Con­certed in­di­vid­ual and col­lec­tive ef­forts are the most ef­fec­tive way to break the dengue trans­mis­sion chain, and bring the dengue si­t­u­a­tion un­der con­trol.”</p>
    <p>Pro­vid­ing an up­date on the dengue si­t­u­a­tion yes­ter­day, the agency said weekly cases have re­mained “per­sis­tently high” at above 1,000 for the eighth con­sec­u­tive week now.</p>
    <p>Large clus­ters also re­main, with up to 79 per cent of mos­qui­toes in the clus­ter near Bukit Pan­jang Ring Road and Je­la­pang Road found to be breed­ing in homes.</p>
    <p>But there are signs that the si­t­u­a­tion could be tak­ing a turn for the bet­ter. Weekly dengue cases fell from a high of 1,792 in the third week of July to 1,380 last week, the NEA said.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of dengue clus­ters has also dropped – from 434 on July 28 to 391 on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>This is partly due to the Gov­ern­ment’s in­ten­si­fied ef­forts, the NEA said, which in­clude mass pub­lic­ity on tele­vi­sion and on­line plat­forms, in­ten­si­fied dengue in­spec­tion, as well as de­ploy­ing vol­un­teers to en­gage res­i­dents in large dengue clus­ter ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Vol­un­teers have en­gaged al­most 55,000 peo­ple, and more than 552,000 in­spec­tions is­land­wide have been con­ducted be­tween Jan­uary and last month.</p>
    <p>This year’s out­break has been par­tic­u­larly bad for sev­eral rea­sons, one of which is that more peo­ple are stay­ing at home in the day due to the coron­avirus pan­demic, which pro­vides “day-biter” mos­qui­toes with more tar­gets.</p>
    <p>Other fac­tors in­clude the preva­lence of a pre­vi­ously less dom­i­nant serotype of dengue which peo­ple have lower im­mu­nity to, which likely led to the un­usu­ally high num­ber of weekly cases since the start of the year, even be­fore the usual dengue sea­son be­gan.</p>
