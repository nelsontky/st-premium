    <p>The 2021 Grammy nom­i­na­tions have been re­leased – and the list is per­plex­ing.</p>
    <p>Cana­dian singer The Weeknd re­ceived a grand to­tal of zero nom­i­na­tions, de­spite hav­ing been one of the most prom­i­nent artists in the con­tem­po­rary mu­sic world in the past year.</p>
    <p>Black Pu­mas, a rel­a­tively ob­scure Amer­i­can band, re­ceived three nom­i­na­tions, in­clud­ing for two of the big­gest prizes – Record of the Year and Al­bum of the Year.</p>
    <p>Granted, the Gram­mys are not a pop­u­lar­ity con­test and con­quer­ing the pop charts has never been an in­di­ca­tion of an artist’s crit­i­cal worth.</p>
    <p>But After Hours, The Weeknd’s fourth al­bum re­leased in March, is one of those rare re­leases lauded by both fans and crit­ics.</p>
    <p>It went straight to No. 1 in the United States, Bri­tain and many other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Blind­ing Lights, a sin­gle from the record, achieved a sim­i­lar feat.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to re­view ag­gre­ga­tor Me­ta­critic, the al­bum scored an av­er­age of 80 out of 100 among mu­sic crit­ics.</p>
    <p>The New York Times called it “laden with sparkled trauma, kalei­do­scopic emo­tional con­fu­sion, ur­gent and pant­ing phys­i­cal re­lease”.</p>
    <p>To be fair, Black Pu­mas did put out an in­trigu­ing epony­mous al­bum last year that had a score of 77 on Me­ta­critic.</p>
    <p>Early this year, they lost the</p>
    <p>award for Best New Artist, their first Grammy nom­i­na­tion, to teen pop star Bil­lie Eil­ish.</p>
    <p>Yet, the nag­ging sus­pi­cion re­mains that the Gram­mys tend to give more at­ten­tion to acts that lean to­wards so-called “legacy” gen­res.</p>
    <p>Black Pu­mas’ mu­sic harks back to the 1960s and 1970s, the golden age of rock and R&B, while The Weeknd’s club-friendly, elec­tronic pop mis­sives have more pull among the younger crowd.</p>
    <p>The nom­i­nees are de­cided by</p>
    <p>The Record­ing Academy, an Amer­i­can in­sti­tu­tion that com­prises pro­fes­sion­als in the mu­sic in­dus­try rang­ing from mu­si­cians to record­ing engi­neers.</p>
    <p>And while the academy has taken ac­tive steps to ad­dress past crit­i­cisms that range from lack of diver­sity in its nom­i­nees and win­ners to be­ing out of touch with the mu­si­cal zeit­geist, the lat­est batch of nom­i­nees shows that there is still room for im­prove­ment.</p>
    <p>It is hard to ar­gue with its big­gest nom­i­nees this year, though – R&B star Bey­once led with nine nods while pop singers Dua Lipa, Tay­lor Swift and rap­per Roddy Ricch re­ceived six each.</p>
    <p>All four have made a con­sid­er­able im­pact in the mu­sic world in the past year.</p>
    <p>Women artists have also had a strong show­ing this year. And for the first time, all the nom­i­nees for Best Rock Per­for­mance are solo women acts or fe­male-fronted bands.</p>
    <p>In past years, the Gram­mys have faced sev­eral ac­cu­sa­tions of mis­treat­ing fe­male artists, in­clud­ing Academy pres­i­dent</p>
    <p>Neil Port­now’s now in­fa­mous pa­tro­n­is­ing com­ment for women artists to “step up” in 2018.</p>
    <p>And while Bey­once has been nom­i­nated sev­eral times for the ma­jor gongs – Song of the Year, Record of the Year and Al­bum of the Year – for works such as Bey­once (2013) and Le­mon­ade (2016), she has never won.</p>
    <p>But she is not alone.</p>
    <p>Some of the most mon­u­men­tal al­bums in con­tem­po­rary mu­sic, from The Bea­tles’ Abbey Road (1969) to Prince’s Pur­ple Rain (1984), did not win Al­bum of the Year de­spite be­ing nom­i­nated.</p>
    <p>And who could for­get the Gram­mys pass­ing over Ken­drick La­mar, widely re­garded as one of the most gifted rap­pers of re­cent times, for lesser rap artist Mack­le­more for Best Rap Al­bum in 2014?</p>
    <p>This is the same La­mar who would later re­ceive the Pulitzer Prize for Mu­sic for his 2017 al­bum, Damn., the first non-clas­si­cal or jazz artist to achieve the feat.</p>
    <p>Where is Mack­le­more now?</p>
