    <p>NEW YORK • Mi­crosoft’s pro­fes­sional net­work­ing site LinkedIn said yes­ter­day that it will cut about 960 jobs, or 6 per cent of its global work­force, as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic is hav­ing a sus­tained im­pact on de­mand for its re­cruit­ment prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia-based LinkedIn helps em­ploy­ers as­sess a can­di­date’s suit­abil­ity for a role, while em­ploy­ees use the plat­form to find new jobs.</p>
    <p>The group said jobs will be cut across its sales and hir­ing di­vi­sions glob­ally.</p>
    <p>A LinkedIn spokesman said in re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times that the Singapore of­fice is among those af­fected. She would not say how many jobs are be­ing shed in Singapore or how many staff the com­pany has in that of­fice.</p>
    <p>An­nounc­ing the plan i n a mes­sage posted on the LinkedIn web­site, chief ex­ec­u­tive Ryan Roslan­sky said the com­pany would pro­vide at least 10 weeks of sev­er­ance pay and will hire for newly created roles from laid-off staff. For US em­ploy­ees, it will pro­vide health in­sur­ance for a year.</p>
    <p>“I want you to know these are the only lay­offs we are plan­ning,” Mr Roslan­sky said in his mes­sage.</p>
    <p>Af­fected staff, some of whom have not yet been told, would be able to keep com­pany-is­sued cell­phones, lap­tops and re­cently pur­chased equip­ment to help them work from home while mak­ing ca­reer tran­si­tions, he said.</p>
    <p>As lock­downs to con­tain the coro­n­avirus have hit busi­nesses around the world, LinkedIn’s busi­ness has been hit as com­pa­nies lay off staff or sharply cur­tail hir­ing.</p>
    <p>LinkedIn said em­ploy­ees af­fected by its j ob cuts will be in­formed this week and they would start re­ceiv­ing in­vi­ta­tions in the few hours af­ter Mr Roslan­sky’s e-mail to meet­ings to learn more about the next steps.</p>
    <p>“If you don’t re­ceive a meeting in­vite, you are not di­rectly im­pacted by this change,” said Mr Roslan­sky.</p>
