    <p>A Korean man, 24, who works at the Azur restau­rant in Crowne Plaza Changi Air­port was among the two un­linked com­mu­nity cases an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The work per­mit holder has also pre­lim­i­nar­ily tested pos­i­tive for the more in­fec­tious B117 strain of Covid-19 and is pend­ing fur­ther con­fir­ma­tory tests.</p>
    <p>He de­liv­ered pre-packed meals to air crew and ho­tel guests, but did not in­ter­act with din­ers at the restau­rant, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>The man’s in­fec­tion was de­tected dur­ing ros­tered rou­tine test­ing last Satur­day. He was tested again on Mon­day. That same day, he de­vel­oped acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion symp­toms.</p>
    <p>His test re­sult came back pos­i­tive for Covid-19 on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>His sero­log­i­cal test re­sult came back neg­a­tive, in­di­cat­ing that this is likely a cur­rent in­fec­tion, said MOH.</p>
    <p>The other com­mu­nity case is a 31-year-old Filipino work per­mit holder who ar­rived from the Philip­pines on Dec 4 and served his stay-home no­tice (SHN) un­til Dec 18. His pre-de­par­ture test on Dec 1 and test on Dec 14 dur­ing SHN were both neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>He is em­ployed by Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal but has yet to start work.</p>
    <p>As part of his pre-em­ploy­ment health screen­ing, he was tested for Covid-19 on Tues­day and his test re­sult came back pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>His sero­log­i­cal test re­sult also came back pos­i­tive, which in­di­cates a likely past in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>There were also 29 im­ported cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,780.</p>
    <p>They com­prise one Sin­ga­porean, two per­ma­nent res­i­dents, one de­pen­dant’s pass holder, five work pass hold­ers, 16 work per­mit hold­ers, one spe­cial pass holder and three short-term visit pass hold­ers.</p>
    <p>They tested pos­i­tive while in iso­la­tion or serv­ing SHN af­ter their ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, said MOH. They had trav­elled from sev­eral coun­tries in­clud­ing Bri­tain, In­dia and In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>MOH also said yes­ter­day that stores in Plaza Sin­ga­pura, The Shoppes at Ma­rina Bay Sands, Junc­tion 8 and Food Par­adise @ NTU Can­teen 2 are among places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were still in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity went up from two cases in the week be­fore to 12 cases in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity also rose from two cases in the week be­fore to five in the past week.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 64 pa­tients are in hos­pi­tal, in­clud­ing one in the in­ten­sive care unit, while 146 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
