    <p>LOS ANGELES • The Chicago Marathon be­came the lat­est ma­jor marathon to fall vic­tim to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic on Mon­day as or­gan­is­ers con­firmed can­cel­la­tion of the race for only the sec­ond time in its his­tory.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion had been largely ex­pected, with sev­eral other ma­jor marathons around the world al­ready suf­fer­ing the same fate be­cause of the out­break.</p>
    <p>The 43rd edi­tion of the race was due to take place on Oct 11, with an es­ti­mated field of around 45,000 run­ners and wheel­chair ath­letes, but was axed for the first time since 1987. Back then, it was not held ow­ing to a loss of spon­sor­ship.</p>
    <p>“The Chicago Marathon is our city’s beloved an­nual cel­e­bra­tion of more than 45,000 run­ners, as well as tens of thou­sands of vol­un­teers, spec­ta­tors and city res­i­dents,” Chicago Mayor Lori Light­foot said.</p>
    <p>“Like all Chicagoans, I’m per­son­ally dis­ap­pointed this year’s event won’t take place as orig­i­nally planned; how­ever, we look for­ward to wel­com­ing all run­ners and their cheer­ing squads once again when the Chicago Marathon re­turns to our city in full force for an­other very ex­cit­ing race.”</p>
    <p>Race di­rec­tor Carey Pinkowski said the de­ci­sion had been taken with the safety of par­tic­i­pants and vol­un­teers in mind.</p>
    <p>“We un­der­stand the dis­ap­point­ment, but when we re­turn to the streets of Chicago, it will be a cel­e­bra­tory mo­ment and an un­com­pro­mis­ing state­ment about the col­lec­tive spirit of who we are as a run­ning com­mu­nity,” he added. “We are pow­er­ful, we are per­sis­tent, and we will reach the fin­ish line again.”</p>
    <p>Chicago is one of the world’s six World Marathon Ma­jors along with races in Tokyo, Bos­ton, London, Ber­lin and New York.</p>
    <p>Tokyo went ahead in March at the out­set of the pan­demic, with only about 200 elite and wheel</p>
