    <p>Malaysian op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim yes­ter­day said that the King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ri’ay­atud­din, has granted him an au­di­ence next Tues­day over his claims that he has se­cured a for­mi­da­ble ma­jor­ity among the coun­try’s elected par­lia­men­tary rep­re­sen­ta­tives to form a new gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>A sched­uled meet­ing on Sept 22 was post­poned af­ter the monarch was taken ill, Datuk Seri An­war said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“At the meet­ing, I will present doc­u­men­ta­tion of the strong and con­vinc­ing ma­jor­ity of MPs as I men­tioned ear­lier,” he said in the state­ment.</p>
    <p>The 73-year-old, in a bomb­shell an­nounce­ment three weeks ago, de­clared that he had se­cured sup­port from a ma­jor­ity of the MPs to re­place the em­bat­tled ad­min­is­tra­tion of Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din</p>
    <p>Yassin, who was ap­pointed Premier in early March.</p>
    <p>He came into of­fice af­ter the pre­vi­ous Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) coali­tion gov­ern­ment headed by Tun Dr Ma­hathir Mo­hamad – which in­cluded Mr An­war’s Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat (PKR) – col­lapsed fol­low­ing a se­ries of de­fec­tions by elected rep­re­sen­ta­tives, in­clud­ing from PKR.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war’s bid late last month to form a gov­ern­ment was quickly en­dorsed by al­lies from the Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party and Parti Amanah Ne­gara, both of which were also in PH, and sub­se­quently gained fur­ther trac­tion af­ter Datuk Seri Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi, pres­i­dent of the long-es­tab­lished Umno and chair­man of the Barisan Na­sional coali­tion, de­clared that he would not stop law­mak­ers un­der his charge from back­ing the op­po­si­tion leader’s bid to wrest con­trol of the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war has yet to pub­licly de­clare the ex­tent of his sup­port among the coun­try’s 222 elected par­lia­men­tary rep­re­sen­ta­tives.</p>
    <p>His ini­tial bid to do so was thwarted be­cause the King was un­ex­pect­edly rushed to hos­pi­tal to treat food poi­son­ing and sports in­juries.</p>
    <p>Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah was dis­charged from hos­pi­tal last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Highly placed sources from PKR said that the palace has set sev­eral con­di­tions for a power grab, in­clud­ing a min­i­mum ma­jor­ity of 118 law­mak­ers in the Lower House, to jus­tify an au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>Un­der the coun­try’s Con­sti­tu­tion, the King, a po­si­tion which is ro­tated among the heads of Malaysia’s nine royal house­holds ev­ery five years, has the sole pre­rog­a­tive to ap­point the prime min­is­ter who he be­lieves has the ma­jor­ity sup­port of MPs.</p>
    <p>“The King is very de­tailed and metic­u­lous. He (An­war) wouldn’t be get­ting the meet­ing if he did not have the num­bers,” said a long­time An­war as­so­ciate who is di­rectly in­volved in the op­po­si­tion leader’s cur­rent cam­paign for the premier­ship, a post that has eluded him since the late 1990s, when he fell out spec­tac­u­larly with then Premier Ma­hathir.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war, who as Deputy Premier was then just a heart­beat away from the top of­fice, was im­pris­oned twice even­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war cur­rently leads the PH coali­tion with 91 elected rep­re­sen­ta­tives, and senior PKR sources con­firm that he has re­ceived sup­port for his bid to wrest power from fac­tions within Umno, par­tic­u­larly MPs aligned to Mr Zahid and for­mer premier Na­jib Razak, who have fallen out with Tan Sri Muhyid­din.</p>
    <p>Elected rep­re­sen­ta­tives from the east­ern states of Sabah and Sarawak are also sup­port­ing the move, said the PKR sources.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din, who is un­der­go­ing self-quar­an­tine af­ter a Cabi­net min­is­ter tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, has yet to com­ment on Mr An­war’s au­di­ence with the King next week.</p>
    <p>But busi­ness­men close to the Premier said that his al­ready ten­u­ous grip on power has come un­der se­ri­ous pres­sure in re­cent weeks fol­low­ing open dis­agree­ments with Umno lead­ers.</p>
    <p>Umno, with 39 elected rep­re­sen­ta­tives, dom­i­nates the cur­rent pact prop­ping up the Muhyid­din-led Perikatan Na­sional gov­ern­ment, which only has a ra­zor-thin twoseat ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment.</p>
