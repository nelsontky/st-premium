    <p>TER­ENCE ONG</p>
    <p>AGE: 35</p>
    <p>HEIGHT: 1.7m</p>
    <p>WEIGHT: 66kg</p>
    <p>Three knee op­er­a­tions be­fore the age of 21 – two due to a torn an­te­rior cru­ci­ate lig­a­ment and the other, a torn menis­cus – left Mr Ong won­der­ing what might have been as he en­tered na­tional ser­vice.</p>
    <p>With his dream of be­com­ing a pro­fes­sional foot­baller dashed, he took up a job in bank­ing after NS, though it was not what he wanted to pur­sue as a ca­reer.</p>
    <p>“The lure of foot­ball proved too much. But with my knee un­able to stand the rigours of the pro­fes­sional game, I pur­sued foot­ball freestylin­g in­stead,” said Mr Ong, who has a Na­tional ITE Cer­tifi­cate in elec­tron­ics from the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Foot­ball freestylin­g in­volves cre­atively jug­gling a foot­ball. It com­bines ball tricks, dance, ac­ro­bat­ics and mu­sic to en­ter­tain on­look­ers and com­pete with op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>Along with a fel­low foot­ball freestyler, Mr Ong founded Ur­ban Street Team in 2009. The nine­mem­ber team have per­formed at events such as the In­ter­na­tional Cham­pi­ons Cup, South-east Asian Games and Youth Olympic Games. They have also rubbed shoul­ders with foot­ball stars such as Paul Pogba and Luis Nani.</p>
    <p>Four years ago, Mr Ong de­cided to im­part his foot­ball knowl­edge. To­gether with a Por­tuguese foot­ball club called Sport­ing CP in Lis­bon, he helped set up their academy here – Sport­ing CP Soc­cer Academy – to teach soc­cer to chil­dren aged six to 16.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong, a bach­e­lor, said: “I want to be an in­spi­ra­tion to kids. I hope I can help as many of them as pos­si­ble to achieve their dream of be­com­ing a good foot­ball player.”</p>
