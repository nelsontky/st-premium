    <p>As a school­boy foot­baller at St Joseph’s In­sti­tu­tion, Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong re­mem­bers aim­ing to reach the Na­tional in­ter-school foot­ball fi­nal so that he and his team could play at the Na­tional Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>“When I was grow­ing up and I re­mem­ber the ex­pe­ri­ence as to why it’s so im­por­tant, it’s seen as a re­ward for mak­ing the Un­der-14, Un­der-16 fi­nals,” said Mr Tong, who wants the younger gen­er­a­tion to build a sim­i­lar con­nec­tion with the Sports Hub.</p>
    <p>“It’s a role that Sports Hub can play as part of sev­eral things to pro­mote Sin­ga­pore school sports… to give bud­ding schoolkids an op­por­tu­nity to say, I want to as­pire to­wards that, to play in our Na­tional Sta­dium.”</p>
    <p>Since open­ing its doors in 2014, the $1.3 bil­lion fa­cil­ity has hosted a slew of in­ter­na­tional sports events, in­clud­ing the HSBC Sin­ga­pore Rugby Sev­ens, foot­ball’s In­ter­na­tional Champions Cup (ICC) and the Women’s Ten­nis As­so­ci­a­tion Fi­nals.</p>
    <p>But that is not enough for some, who feel that a lack of mar­quee sports events has ham­pered the Kal­lang fa­cil­ity in ful­fill­ing its vi­sion of be­com­ing a na­tional sports icon, with Mr Tong ac­knowl­edg­ing that it “can play a big­ger role and can be a lot more a part of an iconic sports ex­pe­ri­ence” for Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Turn­ing the Na­tional Sta­dium into the Lions’ den is also on his wish­list. The sta­dium is des­ig­nated the Home of the Lions but the na­tional foot­ball team have played there fewer than 10 times in the last two years. Their last out­ing there was a 3-1 loss to Uzbek­istan in their World Cup Asian Zone qual­i­fier on</p>
    <p>Oct 15 last year.</p>
    <p>“(Hav­ing the Lions there on a more reg­u­lar ba­sis) is some­thing that ought to be a stan­dard sta­ple. Our na­tional team should be play­ing at the Na­tional Sta­dium,” he stressed.</p>
    <p>“Foot­ball is a big draw, and we should look at that as a pri­or­ity.”</p>
    <p>Since its open­ing six years ago, the Sports Hub has also come un­der scru­tiny for a num­ber of is­sues, in­clud­ing up­heaval in its man­age­ment team from the de­par­ture of a num­ber of se­nior staff – in­clud­ing three chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>In 2016, in­ter­nal strife saw Sports Hub Pte Ltd’s ma­jor eq­uity part­ner, In­fraRed Cap­i­tal Part­ners, propos­ing to ter­mi­nate the con­tract of its venue oper­a­tion part­ner.</p>
    <p>The chal­lenge of bal­anc­ing com­mer­cial in­ter­ests and the Govern­ment’s vi­sion for the Hub has re­port­edly been a dif­fi­cult is­sue for pre­vi­ous lead­ers of the project, which is a 25-year pub­lic-pri­vate part­ner­ship (PPP) be­tween the Sin­ga­pore Sports Hub and the Govern­ment.</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edg­ing that “some of the in­her­ent struc­tural chal­lenges that we face is that we are not the only party in­volved”, Mr Tong stressed that the par­ties need to “come to­gether co­he­sively” to make it work.</p>
    <p>He is not ready to call time on the vi­a­bil­ity of the PPP model, adding that this was “prob­a­bly the most in­no­va­tive” op­tion at the time to re­de­velop the old Na­tional Sta­dium, which opened its doors in 1973.</p>
    <p>“We’ve got to live with it and try and find a way to make it work for us... I don’t look at it as whether it’s a re­gret or no re­gret, it’s just some­thing that we have to deal with as a chal­lenge.”</p>
    <p>And one of those chal­lenges is fill­ing the venue post Covid-19. Mr Tong be­lieves that Sin­ga­pore can get ahead of the com­pe­ti­tion if it is able to “get back into (a) fairly steady state of nor­malcy ear­lier than other coun­tries”.</p>
    <p>“The ques­tion is of course what type of event, which ones can travel, which ones will want to travel. That’s some­thing we need to look at and ex­plore on the mar­ket.”</p>
