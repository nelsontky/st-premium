    <p>PARIS • Lux­ury brand Chris­tian Dior kicked off Paris Fash­ion Week on Tues­day with a so­cially dis­tanced run­way show, where mod­els pa­raded around an art in­stal­la­tion recalling Gothic-style stained­glass win­dows to a live choir per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>Fash­ion brands are hes­i­tantly re­turn­ing to the cat­walk af­ter hold­ing off for many months due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. Paris Fash­ion Week, which runs un­til next Tues­day, will in­clude a mix of phys­i­cal and dig­i­tal events.</p>
    <p>At Dior, guests wore face masks and were given tem­per­a­ture checks, with crowds lim­ited to 300 rather than the 800 to 1,000 the la­bel, owned by LVMH, would nor­mally in­vite.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 cri­sis also in­flu­enced the col­lec­tion, wom­enswear de­signer Maria Grazia Chi­uri said, in­clud­ing with the looser, flow­ing lines of some out­fits meant to “sup­port us, to feel bet­ter”.</p>
    <p>The la­bel’s nor­mally struc­tured and cinched clas­sic Bar jack­ets got a softer makeover, while some looks came with a Ja­panese twist, in­clud­ing ki­mono-like spring coats, in an ar­ray of pais­ley prints, tie-dye stripes or flo­ral pat­terns.</p>
    <p>The styles fea­tured nods to fe­male fig­ures or writ­ers, in­clud­ing a cou­ple of long, but­toned-up white shirts, a style the late Amer­i­can writer Su­san Son­tag has been pic­tured in.</p>
    <p>“This so­cial dis­tance in some way doesn’t help us to have a di­a­logue with the other,” Chi­uri said.</p>
    <p>“So prob­a­bly it’s also for that that I want this di­a­logue with other women, I don’t want to close my­self in a room, to stay alone.”</p>
    <p>A mix of ma­te­ri­als, in­clud­ing In­done­sian ikat fab­rics, also echoed the “collage” theme, as did the il­lu­mi­nated win­dows of the decor by Ital­ian artist Lu­cia Mar­cucci, con­tain­ing a patch­work of photos and news­pa­per clip­pings.</p>
    <p>Some celebri­ties wel­comed the low-key na­ture of the show.</p>
    <p>“I ac­tu­ally feel this new en­vi­ron­ment that we’ve cre­ated with more space and more re­spect for one an­other – I ac­tu­ally think that it’s a much more pleas­ant way of view­ing the shows, and con­sum­ing art,” said Games Of Thrones (2011 to 2019) ac­tress Maisie Wil­liams.</p>
