    <p>AMOUNT BANK IS SU­ING TO RE­COVER FROM AL­LEGED VIC­TIM OF PHONE SCAM |</p>
    <p>UOB says Mr Lim Thiam Ho, 61, owes $105,080 be­cause it made a cash ad­vance un­der his credit card ac­count.</p>
    <p>But he claims that he was duped into log­ging in to his bank ac­count by scam­mers who ap­plied for the cash ad­vance. He is blam­ing</p>
    <p>UOB for fail­ing “to take timely ac­tion to stop the trans­ac­tion” en­tered by the scam­mer de­spite be­ing no­ti­fied of it im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>United Over­seas Bank (UOB) has gone to court to re­cover more than $100,000 it ad­vanced to a re­tiree who has re­fused to pay t he amount, claim­ing that the bank was solely re­spon­si­ble for the loss which arose from an al­leged phone scam.</p>
    <p>UOB says Mr Lim Thiam Ho, 61, owes $105,080 be­cause it made a cash ad­vance un­der his credit card ac­count.</p>
    <p>But he claims that he was duped into log­ging in to his bank ac­count by scam­mers who ap­plied for the cash ad­vance. He is blam­ing UOB for fail­ing “to take timely ac­tion to stop the trans­ac­tion” en­tered by the scam­mer de­spite be­ing no­ti­fied of it im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, he says, he l ost $43,500 of his own funds, which he is coun­ter­claim­ing from the bank.</p>
    <p>The al­leged scam­mer got away with a to­tal of $148,500.</p>
    <p>In court pa­pers seen by The Straits Times, Mr Lim said that he was is­sued a com­pli­men­tary credit card by UOB when he signed up for priv­i­lege bank­ing ser­vices with the bank about 15 years ago.</p>
    <p>He said that at about 11am on Oct 16 l ast year, he re­ceived a phone call from a woman, who claimed to be from Sing­tel, in­form­ing him of “se­cu­rity lapses” in his In­ter­net ac­count.</p>
    <p>The woman of­fered to make se­cu­rity con­fig­u­ra­tions and handed the call to an al­leged en­gi­neer to ob­tain re­mote ac­cess to Mr Lim’s com­puter us­ing the TeamViewer software.</p>
    <p>A third per­son, who iden­ti­fied him­self as “Eric Lewis”, then asked him to sign in to his bank ac­count to al­low them to “se­cure” his bank­ing ac­cess on the com­puter, said Mr Lim.</p>
    <p>He said he did so and felt some­thing was amiss only when “Eric Lewis” re­fused to pro­vide his con­tact de­tails.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim said he i mme­di­ately checked his bank ac­count from an­other com­puter and found that his credit bal­ance had been al­most to­tally de­pleted.</p>
    <p>He quickly logged off from the com­puter and ended the phone call.</p>
    <p>He then called the UOB hot­line to in­form the bank that he had fallen vic­tim to a phone scam. He said he asked to speak to an of­fi­cer-in-charge on an ur­gent ba­sis.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim said the op­er­a­tor told him that she would get some­one to con­tact him. He claimed they re­turned his call nearly six hours later.</p>
    <p>But Mr Lim said that long be­fore they did, about an hour after his ini­tial call, he headed to the UOB Tampines Cen­tral branch “to stop the scam from pro­gress­ing.”</p>
    <p>In his de­fence filed with the court, Mr Lim said a bank staff mem­ber at the branch told him that a cash ad­vance of $105,000 was made to him un­der UOB’s ad­vance credit fa­cil­i­ties and a tele­graphic trans­fer of $148,500 to a Zhang Fu­cai was in progress.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim said the staff mem­ber “as­sured” him that he would can­cel the tele­graphic trans­fer, told him “not to worry” and that he would “take care” of it. The staff mem­ber then as­sisted Mr Lim to sub­mit a can­cel­la­tion re­quest.</p>
    <p>There­after, Mr Lim re­turned home and made a po­lice re­port on­line.</p>
    <p>When he fol­lowed up with the bank the next day, he was told that the tele­graphic trans­fer was not can­celled and that the money had been trans­ferred to the re­cip­i­ent.</p>
    <p>In his coun­ter­claim, Mr Lim blamed UOB for fail­ing to en­sure that its em­ploy­ees were suf­fi­ciently trained to deal with sit­u­a­tions in­volv­ing scam trans­ac­tions and es­tab­lish­ing ad­e­quate safe­guards to en­sure that such trans­ac­tions are stopped in­stan­ta­neously or ex­pe­di­tiously.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim, who is rep­re­sented by</p>
    <p>Chia Wong Cham­bers, also de­nied hav­ing en­tered into any agree­ment with the bank for the ad­vance fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>UOB, rep­re­sented by Shook Lin & Bok LLP, dis­puted Mr Lim’s claims that the Tampines branch of­fi­cer had as­sured him that he would can­cel the tele­graphic trans­fer and nei­ther did he tell Mr Lim not to worry nor that he would “take care” of it.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim also has to prove that the scam took place.</p>
    <p>In its re­ply to Mr Lim’s de­fence, UOB said that its records showed the log­ging in to Mr Lim’s per­sonal In­ter­net bank­ing ac­count, the re</p>
    <p>quest for a cash ad­vance of $105,000 from his credit card to his i-ac­count, the ad­di­tion of the ben­e­fi­ciary ac­count as a payee and the trans­fer of the sum of $148,500 from his i-ac­count to the ben­e­fi­ciary ac­count were all au­tho­rised and au­then­ti­cated by him.</p>
    <p>When Mr Lim and his son re­ported to the bank’s branch about pos­si­ble fraud­u­lent ac­tiv­i­ties, UOB said the branch of­fi­cer was un­cer­tain if the sum had been cred­ited to the ben­e­fi­ciary ac­count and ad­vised Mr Lim to sub­mit a can­cel­la­tion re­quest to try to re­call the funds.</p>
    <p>The bank sub­se­quently ob­tained the sta­tus of the remit­tance from the Swift Global Pay­ment In­no­va­tion sys­tem and noted that the amount had been cred­ited into a Hong Kong ac­count with HSBC which said that any re­call was sub­ject to ap­proval from the ben­e­fi­ciary ac­count holder.</p>
    <p>UOB said the bank has waived any in­ter­est on the cash ad­vance amount of $105,000 from Mr Lim’s ac­count un­til both par­ties come to a con­sen­sus. Mr Lim was in­formed in April that his credit card ac­count had been ter­mi­nated.</p>
