    <p>NEW YORK Ms Sa­man­tha Kac­marik, a Latina col­lege stu­dent in Las Vegas, said that four years ago, she had viewed Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton, the Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date in the 2016 election, as part of a cor­rupt po­lit­i­cal es­tab­lish­ment.</p>
    <p>Ms Flow­ers For­ever, a black trans­gen­der mu­sic pro­ducer in Mil­wau­kee, said she had thought Mrs Clin­ton would not change any­thing for the bet­ter.</p>
    <p>And Mr Thomas Mo­line, a white re­tired garbage col­lec­tor in Minneapoli­s, said he sim­ply had not trusted her.</p>
    <p>None of them voted for Mrs Clin­ton. All of them plan to vote for the cur­rent Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date, Mr Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>“I knew early on that Trump def­i­nitely wasn’t the guy for me,” re­called Mr Mo­line. But when it came to Mrs Clin­ton, he said: “I guess I had a bad taste in my mouth from her hus­band’s eight years in of­fice.”</p>
    <p>He voted for Mr Gary John­son, the Lib­er­tar­ian can­di­date, a de­ci­sion he re­grets. Mr Mo­line said: “I iden­tify more with Bi­den – whether that’s be­ing a male chau­vin­ist or what­ever you want to call me.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den is not Mrs Clin­ton.</p>
    <p>And, for many Democrats and in­de­pen­dents who sat out the 2016 United States pres­i­den­tial election, voted for third-party can­di­dates or backed cur­rent President Don­ald Trump, it is a ra­tio­nale for their vote that comes up re­peat­edly: Mr Bi­den is more ac­cept­able to them than Mrs Clin­ton was, in ways large and small, per­sonal and po­lit­i­cal, sex­ist and not – and those dif­fer­ences help them feel more com­fort­able vot­ing for the Demo­cratic nom­i­nee this time.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den also ben­e­fits, of course, from the in­tense de­sire among Democrats to get Mr Trump out of of­fice. A ma­jor­ity of vot­ers give the President low marks for his han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the dom­i­nant is­sue of the race.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den now leads Mr Trump in many pub­lic polls by big­ger mar­gins than Mrs Clin­ton had in 2016.</p>
    <p>In pri­vate polling and focus groups, vot­ers ex­press more pos­i­tive views of Mr Bi­den than of Mrs Clin­ton, though they know far less about his decades in po­lit­i­cal of­fice.</p>
    <p>In­ter­views with dozens of vot­ers, union mem­bers and Demo­cratic strate­gists re­veal a party embracing Mr Bi­den – a 77-year-old white man – as a fa­mil­iar po­lit­i­cal pitch.</p>
    <p>“It’s just a lot eas­ier with Joe Bi­den be­cause he’s a guy and he’s an old white guy. I hate say­ing that, but it’s the truth,” said Mr Aaron Stearns, the Demo­cratic chair in War­ren County in Penn­syl­va­nia.</p>
    <p>Even as Mr Bi­den pro­poses a much big­ger role for gov­ern­ment than Mrs Clin­ton did four years ago, some vot­ers view him as more mod­er­ate, and they do not see Mr Bi­den as be­ing as di­vi­sive a po­lit­i­cal fig­ure as they did her.</p>
    <p>Polling shows Mr Bi­den scor­ing higher than Mrs Clin­ton among a wide range of de­mo­graphic groups – most no­tably older vot­ers, white vot­ers and sub­ur­ban­ites.</p>
    <p>But his ad­van­tage is stark among those who sat out the 2016 election or backed third-party can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den leads Mr Trump, 49 per cent to 19 per cent, among likely vot­ers who backed third-party can­di­dates in 2016, ac­cord­ing to re­cent polling of bat­tle­ground states by The New York Times and Siena Col­lege.</p>
    <p>Among reg­is­tered vot­ers who sat out the 2016 election, Mr Bi­den leads by 9 per­cent­age points.</p>
    <p>In­ter­nal polling con­ducted for the campaign of former pres­i­den­tial hope­ful Bernie San­ders found that Mr Bi­den had a reser­voir of good­will that Mrs Clin­ton did not pos­sess.</p>
    <p>“He was a hard guy to hit,” said Mr Ben Tulchin, Mr San­ders’ poll­ster. “There’s not a lot of pas­sion for him, but they like him.”</p>
