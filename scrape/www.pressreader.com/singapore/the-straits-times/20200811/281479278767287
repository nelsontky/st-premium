    <p>The Covid-19 out­break has made cy­cling more pop­u­lar – not only as a leisure ac­tiv­ity, but also as a mode of trans­port for those who wish to avoid buses and trains.</p>
    <p>So much so that bi­cy­cle shops are run­ning out of stock, and prices of pop­u­lar brands have shot up.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond-hand Bromp­ton bi­cy­cles, for in­stance, are ad­ver­tised for as much as $5,000 to $8,000 apiece be­cause new ones – which cost around $2,500 – are in short sup­ply.</p>
    <p>And par­al­lel im­porters are sell­ing Da­hon bikes for as much as 40 per cent more than what au­tho­rised agents were sell­ing them for when they had stock.</p>
    <p>Mr Wil­liam Loo, 69, who im­ports KHS bi­cy­cles, said sales had grown by 30 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause of Covid-19, peo­ple are ex­er­cis­ing a lot more. If you go on the road or the park con­nec­tors, you see a lot more cy­clists,” he said. “I have never sold so many bi­cy­cles be­fore. For ex­am­ple, Mustafa (Cen­tre), which used to take one or two bikes from me a week, now or­ders 14 a week.”</p>
    <p>Mr Paul Fam, 55, who owns a bi­cy­cle shop in Paya Le­bar, said the clam­p­down on the use of per­sonal mo­bil­ity devices (PMDs) since last year had also con­trib­uted to the surge in bike sales.</p>
    <p>He noted, though, that most PMD users have moved to e-bikes rather than con­ven­tional ones.</p>
    <p>The grow­ing pop­u­lar­ity of bi­cy­cles has spawned sev­eral new play­ers, Mr Fam said.</p>
    <p>“Even durian sell­ers and phonecover sell­ers are now sell­ing bi­cy­cles,” he added. “And some peo­ple are sell­ing from their HDB flats.”</p>
    <p>BofA Se­cu­ri­ties an­a­lyst Rafe Jadrosich, who cov­ers the bi­cy­cle in­dus­try, among other sec­tors, said there has been “a sig­nif­i­cant surge in re­tail sales of bi­cy­cles glob­ally since the out­break of Covid-19”.</p>
    <p>“Con­sumers are shift­ing spend­ing away from tra­di­tional leisure ac­tiv­i­ties towards what we call soli­tary leisure ac­tiv­i­ties... and cy­cling would be one.”</p>
    <p>He cited bike stores in the United States, where sales had more than dou­bled in April and May; and “as soon as the lock­downs were lifted” in Europe, “long lines formed out­side bi­cy­cle stores”. A sim­i­lar surge has been ob­served in Asia, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Jadrosich said the vi­a­bil­ity of cy­cling as a means of com­mut­ing de­pends largely on avail­able in­fra­struc­ture – and not so much on weather, which is of­ten cited as one rea­son why Sin­ga­pore­ans have shied away from ped­alling to work.</p>
    <p>“In Europe, where the use of cy­cling for com­mut­ing is much higher than any­where else in the world, it’s been sup­ported by re­ally strong in­fra­struc­ture in­vest­ments,” he said. “And it gets cold in the win­ter, for ex­am­ple, but you still see the mix of com­mut­ing can be very high.”</p>
    <p>Bukit Pan­jang res­i­dent Bernard Hii is one of the many Sin­ga­pore­ans who are now us­ing the bi­cy­cle, not only for bet­ter health, but also as a mode of trans­port.</p>
    <p>Mr Hii, 30, a ware­house su­per­vi­sor, be­gan cy­cling to his work­place in Joo Koon – about 17km from his home – be­fore the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod. “I want to avoid the crowd be­cause of Covid-19,” he said. “And I used to cy­cle in my univer­sity days in Malaysia six years ago.”</p>
    <p>Re­gional sales man­ager Carl Sa­hetapy, 41, started cy­cling to work oc­ca­sion­ally in Jan­uary. The Hougang res­i­dent works in Or­chard Road, and the jour­ney is 12km by road and 15km by park con­nec­tors.</p>
    <p>“I did it ini­tially to get fit­ter,” he said. “Then in March, I did it to avoid the crowds on trains and buses.”</p>
    <p>Ang Mo Kio res­i­dent Xavier Lum, 38, also said he started cy­cling to work to “min­imise con­tact with crowds” as well as to lose weight. The biotech en­gi­neer cur­rently ped­als to Seran­goon MRT sta­tion on a fold­able bike, and con­tin­ues the rest of the way to Ou­tram by train.</p>
    <p>But he said he might cy­cle all the way once he gets fit­ter.</p>
    <p>BofA Se­cu­ri­ties an­a­lyst Rafe Jadrosich said there has been “a sig­nif­i­cant surge in re­tail sales of bi­cy­cles glob­ally since the out­break of Covid-19”.</p>
