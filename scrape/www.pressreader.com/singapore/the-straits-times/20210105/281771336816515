    <p>More than 12,000 trav­ellers from higher-risk coun­tries or re­gions en­tered Sin­ga­pore with­out pre-de­par­ture tests from Nov 18 to Dec 27 last year, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>These are mostly Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens and per­ma­nent res­i­dents (PRs).</p>
    <p>So far, around 100 – or 0.85 per cent of these trav­ellers – have tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19. None of these cases has re­sulted in lo­cal trans­mis­sion, said Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling Covid-19.</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore has re­quired trav­ellers from higher-risk places to take a pre-de­par­ture test since Nov 18 last year, this rule does not ap­ply to cit­i­zens and PRs.</p>
    <p>“We do not want to place ad­di­tional bar­ri­ers for them to re­turn home if they have ur­gent need to do so,” Mr Wong said.</p>
    <p>As pae­di­atric test­ing ser­vices may not be so eas­ily avail­able in some coun­tries, those aged six and be­low are also ex­empted from such tests, he added.</p>
    <p>“But through the stay-home no­tice, we en­sure that com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion risks for these trav­ellers are min­imised,” said Mr Wong in re­sponse to a ques­tion by Work­ers’ Party’s Mr Ger­ald Giam (Alju­nied GRC) on how the Govern­ment man­ages the risk of in­com­ing ar­rivals.</p>
    <p>Mr Giam asked if there were any trav­ellers in the 12,000 who were not Sin­ga­pore­ans, PRs or chil­dren un­der six. He also asked if any of the 100 or so peo­ple who later tested pos­i­tive had not taken pre­de­par­ture tests even though they were sup­posed to do so.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said he has not looked at the data in great de­tail. But he stressed that trav­ellers from such high-risk ter­ri­to­ries ar­riv­ing in Sin­ga­pore have to serve the stay­home no­tice, and cases that emerge are iso­lated and ringfenced so that they do not leak into the lo­cal com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore has been able to bring the virus sit­u­a­tion un­der con­trol and en­ter phase three of its re­open­ing on Dec 28, the coun­try can­not let its guard down, he said.</p>
    <p>He noted that Covid-19 cases con­tinue to climb in many coun­tries.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, there have been two fam­ily clus­ters due to marine work­ers who had been in­fected on board ships and spread the virus to their fam­ily mem­bers.</p>
    <p>“It is a sober­ing re­minder of how eas­ily new in­fec­tion clus­ters can break out,” said Mr Wong, stress­ing that Sin­ga­pore must con­tinue to stay alert.</p>
    <p>“The emer­gence of new vi­ral strains that may be more in­fec­tious, such as the B.1.1.7 vari­ant, is in­deed very wor­ry­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will tighten bor­der re­stric­tions where nec­es­sary and prac­ti­cal to limit the risk of im­ported cases, he said.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, ad­di­tional test­ing re­quire­ments have been in­tro­duced for trav­ellers from Bri­tain and South Africa, where the new strain has been cir­cu­lat­ing.</p>
    <p>The test­ing regime and safe man­age­ment mea­sures for those work­ing in the avi­a­tion and mar­itime sec­tors have also been tight­ened.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore takes a cal­cu­lated risk-based ap­proach in how it man­ages its borders, Mr Wong noted.</p>
    <p>Spe­cial travel ar­range­ments with cer­tain coun­tries and ter­ri­to­ries have been set up to fa­cil­i­tate es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial travel, with the num­ber of trav­ellers con­trolled tightly. Trav­ellers also have to stick to a con­trolled itin­er­ary and strictly limit in­ter­ac­tions with the wider com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to Ms Cheng Li Hui (Tampines GRC), he cited how about 500 trav­ellers have ar­rived from China through the fast lane that was es­tab­lished be­tween Sin­ga­pore and six prov­inces and mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties in China last June.</p>
    <p>On a daily ba­sis, a far larger num­ber of trav­ellers en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore are re­turn­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans, PRs and long-term pass hold­ers, he said. There are also new mi­grant work­ers – mostly con­struc­tion work­ers and for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers.</p>
    <p>“We need them to build our homes and in­fra­struc­ture, and to sup­port the care­giv­ing needs of our fam­i­lies,” said Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>The en­try of re­turn­ing res­i­dents and es­sen­tial work­ers is al­lowed on a con­trolled ba­sis, he added, with those from higher-risk na­tions placed on a 14-day stay-home no­tice at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties and tested at the end of their quar­an­tine.</p>
