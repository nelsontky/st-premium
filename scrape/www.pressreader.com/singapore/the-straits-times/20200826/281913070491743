    <p>SYD­NEY • Aus­tralia’s dev­as­tat­ing 2019-2020 bush fires were “clearly” fu­elled by cli­mate change, a gov­ern­ment in­quiry re­ported yes­ter­day, fol­low­ing some of the largest for­est fires recorded world­wide.</p>
    <p>With this year’s fire sea­son al­ready un­der way, the au­thor­i­ties rec­om­mended ur­gent ac­tion to limit the im­pact of ex­treme blazes, ex­pected “to be­come more fre­quent” in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>The deadly bush fires raged for nine months till March and were most se­vere in New South Wales state, where 11,000 fires burned more than 5.5 mil­lion ha – the size of many coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Af­ter months of con­sul­ta­tion and ex­pert tes­ti­mony, the New South Wales gov­ern­ment yes­ter­day pub­lished a 436-page re­port on the blazes that de­stroyed more than 2,400 homes in the state and left 26 peo­ple dead.</p>
    <p>The text in­cluded dozens of rec­om­men­da­tions and fea­tured a blunt re­buke of those who in­sisted the fires had noth­ing to do with cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>“Cli­mate change as a re­sult of in­creased green­house gas emis­sions clearly played a role in the con­di­tions that led up to the fires and in the un­re­lent­ing con­di­tions that sup­ported the fires to spread,” it read.</p>
    <p>The re­port noted it was im­pos­si­ble to say what pre­cise role cli­mate change had played in pro­duc­ing the com­plex range of cli­matic con­di­tions that helped fuel the fires.</p>
    <p>Those con­di­tions in­cluded a years-long drought, high winds, thun­der­storms and low hu­mid­ity.</p>
    <p>While cau­tion­ing that “cli­mate change does not ex­plain ev­ery­thing that hap­pened”, the authors noted that the cat­a­strophic con­di­tions were “con­sis­tent with what cli­mate change pro­jec­tions have been say­ing will hap­pen”.</p>
    <p>“Ex­treme fires and fire sea­sons are likely to be­come more fre­quent,” they warned.</p>
    <p>The re­port also rub­bished sug­ges­tions by those op­pos­ing ac­tion on cli­mate change – in­clud­ing some in­side Aus­tralia’s con­ser­va­tive gov­ern­ment – that ar­son and in­suf­fi­cient for­est clear­ance were to blame.</p>
    <p>Only 11 of the blazes in New South Wales were found to have been the work of an ar­son­ist de­lib­er­ately try­ing to start a bush fire.</p>
    <p>Many of the largest fires were caused by light­ning strikes in re­mote ar­eas, the doc­u­ment said.</p>
    <p>The re­port’s rec­om­men­da­tions largely fo­cused on dis­as­ter re­sponse and mit­i­ga­tion, in­clud­ing the use of tech­nol­ogy to de­tect re­mote fires more quickly, and in­creased aerial wa­ter-bomb­ing to stop them grow­ing beyond con­trol.</p>
    <p>New South Wales said yes­ter­day it will com­pel own­ers to clear their land of flammable ma­te­rial as it en­dorsed all 76 rec­om­men­da­tions from the in­quiry.</p>
