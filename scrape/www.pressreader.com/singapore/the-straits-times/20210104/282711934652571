    <p>Ms Lynn Chua rec­om­mends these books for tod­dlers and pre-school­ers who are start­ing school. They are avail­able at pub­lic li­braries and in book­stores.</p>
    <p>SPOT GOES TO SCHOOL By Eric Hill</p>
    <p>“This is the book that I used to help my son over­come his anx­i­ety of go­ing to school when he was young. He would al­ways cry. It gives kids an idea of the ac­tiv­i­ties that go on in pre-school. But the most im­por­tant page, for me, was the last one, in which all the par­ent-an­i­mals re­turn to take their chil­dren home. Many kids fear that once they are dropped off at school, Daddy and Mummy are not com­ing back. So, I’d point out to my son, ‘You see, Spot’s mummy is back for him. His friends’ mum­mies and dad­dies are back for them.”</p>
    <p>MAISY GOES TO NURS­ERY By Lucy Cousins</p>
    <p>“This is an­other good book to share with the lit­tle ones about what they can ex­pect when they are at a child­care cen­tre. It shows Maisy and her friends paint­ing, lis­ten­ing to sto­ries, even go­ing to the toi­let, wash­ing hands and tak­ing naps. When they wake up, they have out­door play and other ac­tiv­i­ties un­til it is time to go home. Maisy has a good time at the nurs­ery – and so would your child.”</p>
