    <p>I pur­chased a con­do­minium unit built by a for­eign de­vel­oper in 2016.</p>
    <p>In the midst of the tem­po­rary oc­cu­pa­tion per­mit pe­riod, we were thrilled to know that the de­vel­op­ment had been awarded Best High-End Condo De­vel­op­ment at the South-east Asia Prop­erty Awards (Sin­ga­pore).</p>
    <p>We moved into the con­do­minium in 2018 but, un­for­tu­nately, the thrill of be­ing a new home owner came to an end when we dis­cov­ered one de­fect af­ter an­other.</p>
    <p>Though rec­ti­fi­ca­tion was done re­peat­edly dur­ing the de­fects li­a­bil­ity pe­riod, the same de­fects kept reap­pear­ing.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the bath­room drain re­mained choked, even af­ter two at­tempts at clear­ing. It was only on the third at­tempt, when a fist-size dried ce­ment block was lifted out, that the drain was cleared.</p>
    <p>Upon hear­ing about sev­eral sim­i­lar in­ci­dents, we got the im­pres­sion that rec­ti­fi­ca­tions seem to be done on a trial-and-er­ror ba­sis.</p>
    <p>When rec­ti­fi­ca­tion ser­vice is ren­dered, the prob­lem is usu­ally con­sid­ered re­solved. There would be no is­sue if the prob­lem is fixed, but in the case of my con­do­minium, the same is­sue kept reap­pear­ing.</p>
    <p>This has made us ques­tion the ca­pa­bil­ity of the rec­ti­fi­ca­tion team, and with it, that of the main con­trac­tor and de­vel­oper.</p>
    <p>From the dis­cus­sions I had with the in­dus­try spe­cial­ists brought in to ad­dress the drain is­sue, I un­der­stand that un­seen de­fects are much more com­mon nowa­days due to le­nient qual­ity con­trol. As a re­sult, the newer de­vel­op­ments are more prone to de­fects than the older ones. Le­nient qual­ity con­trol and man­age­ment dur­ing the build­ing process may lead to ma­jor is­sues that home own­ers have to deal with in the long run.</p>
    <p>I was sur­prised and puz­zled that though the de­vel­oper is an es­tab­lished firm and the prop­erty had won an award or­gan­ised by a well-known com­pany, their brand names were not an as­sur­ance of qual­ity. As a new home owner, I was dis­ap­pointed by the condo’s qual­ity and the ser­vice ren­dered.</p>
    <p>I hope that qual­ity con­trol in the con­struc­tion sec­tor will not be­come a thing of the past.</p>
    <p>If such prac­tices per­sist and be­come a stan­dard, many home own­ers would feel ag­grieved.</p>
    <p>Le­nient qual­ity con­trol and man­age­ment dur­ing the build­ing process may lead to ma­jor is­sues that home own­ers have to deal with in the long run.</p>
