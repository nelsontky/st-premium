    <p>For­mer ac­tress Cherie Lim is lo­cal bil­lion­aire Peter Lim’s sec­ond wife; Kim Lim is his daugh­ter. The two are a gen­er­a­tion apart, but have grown as close as sis­ters. Icon magazine edi­tor Sylvester Ng finds out why Cherie has stayed out of the lime­light and how Kim is cop­ing with di­vorce Big house, bet­ter car, but life is still the same</p>
    <p>Cherie Lim be­gins belt­ing out the Hokkien hit Wife at a re­cent karaoke ses­sion. Even af­ter more than 20 years away from the spot­light, her voice re­mains melo­di­ous.</p>
    <p>Not many re­mem­ber, but Lim, who turned 50 this year, recorded an al­bum when she was 25, ti­tled A Woman Who Can’t Be With­out Love – and, in­deed, she has not been with­out love all these years.</p>
    <p>The for­mer model grad­u­ated in 1989 from the ninth ac­tors’ train­ing pro­gramme of what was then known as Sin­ga­pore Broad­cast­ing Cor­po­ra­tion (now Me­di­a­corp) along­side Ter­ence Cao and Xie Shaoguang.</p>
    <p>Lim starred in dra­mas such as The Fu­ture Is Mine (1991) and Young Jus­tice Bao (1994), but left the broad­caster in 1994 for public re­la­tions and later started her own modelling agency.</p>
    <p>She mar­ried bil­lion­aire mag­nate Peter Lim in 2003. Mr Lim, 67, who comes from a mod­est fam­ily, be­came Sin­ga­pore’s top stock­bro­ker and later a pro­fes­sional in­vestor in 1996. In 2018, he made it to No. 12 on Forbes’ list of the rich­est peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore, with US$2.4 bil­lion (S$3.3 bil­lion) to his name.</p>
    <p>Lim is the ty­coon’s sec­ond wife. The neg­a­tive press that their re­la­tion­ship gen­er­ated made the public look askance at their nup­tials. “Thank­fully, I had the sup­port of my fam­ily and friends. They are the peo­ple I care most about,” she says.</p>
    <p>Now, af­ter al­most 25 years of keep­ing a dis­tance from the me­dia, she has made an ex­cep­tion by ap­pear­ing on the August is­sue of Icon magazine with step­daugh­ter Kim Lim.</p>
    <p>She says: “When I first en­tered en­ter­tain­ment, I be­came friends with a lot of jour­nal­ists. But when my re­la­tion­ship got ex­posed, these friends used me as fod­der for their sto­ries, some­times with­out even in­ter­view­ing me – they would write these half-truths. When I read those things, I felt hurt and dis­ap­pointed.”</p>
    <p>Though she un­der­stood the jour­nal­ists were just do­ing their job, she de­cided to keep away from the me­dia.</p>
    <p>MOD­EST BEGIN­NINGS</p>
    <p>Lim had a sim­ple child­hood grow­ing up in a three-room flat with her par­ents, grand­mother and broth­ers.</p>
    <p>She be­came a part-time model to earn money for driv­ing lessons, but later left the en­ter­tain­ment business be­cause the monthly pay of $900 was not enough to help her fam­ily make ends meet.</p>
    <p>When asked about the changes in her life since be­com­ing Mrs Lim, she says: “Of course now I can drive a bet­ter car and live in a big­ger house, but tech­ni­cally, my life is still the same – I’m not some­one who pur­sues lux­ury.”</p>
    <p>She loves to ex­er­cise, and works out and golfs with friends weekly. Cy­cling along the park con­nec­tor from Bukit Timah to Kranji at 5am is one of her reg­u­lar ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Lim may now be liv­ing a life of com­fort, but she has not for­got­ten her past hard­ships. In 2000, she founded Op­er­a­tion Red­shirt with a few friends to dis­trib­ute es­sen­tials dur­ing the Chi­nese New Year pe­riod to needy res­i­dents of sin­gle­room flats.</p>
    <p>She has also brought along her stepchil­dren Kim and Wee Kiat (Peter Lim’s son) to give out goody bags with her ev­ery year.</p>
    <p>“Kim and Kiat have grown up very com­fort­ably. I want them to know that there are peo­ple who have dif­fi­cult lives in our so­ci­ety and need our help to make sure they make a habit of giv­ing back to the com­mu­nity,” she says.</p>
    <p>This has since be­come a fam­ily tra­di­tion. Kim Lim, now 29, has ex­panded the op­er­a­tion to in­clude more neigh­bour­hoods in re­cent years and, due to the pan­demic this year, fur­ther pre­pared masks and hand sani­tis­ers for needy el­derly.</p>
    <p>WATCH­ING KIM GROW UP</p>
    <p>Lim lets on that, though her step­daugh­ter Kim grew up be­fore her eyes, the two were not al­ways on good terms and it took a long ad­just­ment pe­riod for them to get close.</p>
    <p>“I can un­der­stand her feel­ings. She was so young then, and sud­denly there was some­one new in her fam­ily and that was not easy for her to ac­cept. It was a process of growth and learn­ing for both of us.”</p>
    <p>Kim mar­ried BK Kho in 2016 and had their son Ky­den in 2017. She di­vorced this year.</p>
    <p>And, when Kim pre­sented her pro­posal to open aes­thet­ics clinic Il­lu­mia Ther­a­peu­tics and hair-care salon Papilla Hair­care last year, the fam­ily was sur­prised.</p>
    <p>Lim, de­spite be­ing afraid of pain, sup­ported her step­daugh­ter by be­com­ing a cus­tomer.</p>
    <p>She says of her step­daugh­ter: “Kim be­came more ma­ture af­ter she be­came a mother. Her life is more struc­tured and she is more re­spon­si­ble. Our re­la­tion­ship be­came bet­ter and now we’re like good friends.”</p>
