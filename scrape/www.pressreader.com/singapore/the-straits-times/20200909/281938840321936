    <p>The sec­ond, three-year phase of the Cool­ing Sin­ga­pore pro­ject is un­der way with a “dig­i­tal twin” of the Repub­lic be­ing built which will al­low re­searchers and pol­i­cy­mak­ers to find out the var­i­ous fac­tors that af­fect out­door tem­per­a­tures, be it traf­fic flow, the type of land sur­face, or the prox­im­ity of a wa­ter body. They can also use the model to see how new strate­gies can be de­vised to make it more com­fort­able for peo­ple to be out­doors. Data on Sin­ga­pore’s build­ings, traf­fic, veg­e­ta­tion and land sur­faces will be in­cor­po­rated. Other fac­tors, such as the di­rec­tion and amount of wind that a par­tic­u­lar area gets, or the rel­a­tive hu­mid­ity, will be in­cor­po­rated in the model, called the Dig­i­tal Ur­ban Cli­mate Twin, or Duct.</p>
    <p>The Cool­ing Sin­ga­pore pro­ject, which is funded by the Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion, ad­dresses a key is­sue: Sin­ga­pore has be­come warmer in re­cent years be­cause of what is termed the ur­ban heat is­land (UHI) ef­fect. The UHI ef­fect, which is the air tem­per­a­ture dif­fer­ence be­tween ru­ral and ur­ban ar­eas, helps ex­plain how ur­ban­i­sa­tion and hu­man be­hav­iour con­trib­ute to higher tem­per­a­tures in a city. In trop­i­cal Sin­ga­pore, in­creased tem­per­a­tures ow­ing to the UHI ef­fect have an im­pact on live­abil­ity, not least in the form of ther­mal com­fort out­doors. Thus, re­duc­ing the ef­fect will clearly im­prove peo­ple’s qual­ity of life. The Cool­ing Sin­ga­pore web­site warns that many of th­ese prob­lems are likely to be­come more se­vere, partly be­cause of ur­ban growth but also be­cause of the im­pact of cli­mate change on cities.</p>
    <p>The Cool­ing Sin­ga­pore pro­ject aims to assess and mea­sure cool­ing strate­gies, de­velop a de­ci­sion sup­port sys­tem, and de­sign cli­mate-re­spon­sive guide­lines. The pro­ject is an ex­am­ple of the devel­op­ment of tech­no­log­i­cal re­search and of sci­en­tific met­rics and tools, and their use as part of a whole-of-gov­ern­ment ap­proach. This is im­por­tant since poli­cies will im­pinge on a range of ar­eas, in­clud­ing plan­ning, trans­port, con­struc­tion and pat­terns of in­di­vid­ual con­sump­tion. The pro­ject’s first phase, which be­gan in 2017 and has ended, came up with 86 strate­gies to cool the city. Phase two will no doubt help fi­nesse plans through sim­u­la­tion that em­ploys real-life pa­ram­e­ters.</p>
    <p>Ex­cit­ing as th­ese sci­en­tific ex­plo­rations of re­al­ity are, they need to be com­ple­mented by pub­lic aware­ness of the fragility of eco­log­i­cal life. Cli­mate change in gen­eral and global warm­ing in par­tic­u­lar are ex­is­ten­tial threats that are recog­nised widely and deeply to­day. How­ever, per­sonal and or­gan­i­sa­tional re­spon­si­bil­ity for in­tan­gi­ble but gen­uinely de­struc­tive change – such as ac­tiv­i­ties that con­trib­ute to grow­ing the car­bon foot­print – is not treated se­ri­ously by all. Ev­ery­day be­hav­iour, man­i­fested in the con­sump­tion of sin­gle-use plas­tic bags, for ex­am­ple, does leave an in­cre­men­tal scar on the en­vi­ron­ment. Sin­ga­pore­ans need to be bet­ter en­vi­ron­men­tal ci­ti­zens.</p>
