    <p>Group man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Adrenalin Group, an event man­age­ment com­pany that cham­pi­ons an in­clu­sive work­place</p>
    <p>“Ten years of hard work and heart work al­most wiped out in 10 days. Covid-19 has dec­i­mated the events in­dus­try,” said Mr Richardo Chua.</p>
    <p>For Adrenalin, that meant its best start of the year ever in terms of for­ward sales turned into can­cel­la­tions of al­most 30 con­tracts in two weeks. It went from growth and ex­cite­ment to cuts and dis­tress.</p>
    <p>On de­fence, it had to find creative ways to save costs and on of­fence, it had to find in­no­va­tive new ways of bring­ing in rev­enue.</p>
    <p>“So our On­line X Hy­brid strat­egy was born, an idea not from me but from mul­ti­ple mem­bers of the team. We launched our own Face­book show, called the Good Peo­ple Show, to give us the much-needed prac­tice, to spread the word on our ca­pa­bil­i­ties and to shine the spot­light on wor­thy causes dur­ing th­ese dark days.</p>
    <p>“Many team­mates ad­justed and trans­formed their roles and took the pay cuts in their stride. The unity of the team has seen us through the worst days so far.”</p>
