    <p>Much of the first three years of Ang Kee Meng’s time as a na­tional track cy­clist was spent over­com­ing road­blocks like search­ing for suit­able velo­dromes over­seas to train in and find­ing ways to fi­nance these stints.</p>
    <p>Back in 2010, the Sin­ga­pore Cy­cling Fed­er­a­tion (SCF) did not have a track cy­cling dis­ci­pline. This meant Ang, who even­tu­ally be­came the first Sin­ga­porean to com­pete at the In­ter­na­tional Cy­cling Union Track Cy­cling World Cup in 2013, was mostly left to his own de­vices with lit­tle guid­ance.</p>
    <p>These strug­gles prompted him to join the SCF’s ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee in 2016 as vice-pres­i­dent of track cy­cling, largely to en­sure the right pro­grammes and knowl­edge were in place for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“There were a lot of things that could have been more cost- and time-ef­fi­cient, but I went through the long route and I don’t want them to go through that trou­ble, and the only way for de­ci­sions to be made was to be­come an exco mem­ber,” Ang, 34, said.</p>
    <p>His jour­ney from ath­lete to ad­min­is­tra­tor is be­com­ing more com­mon in re­cent years, as more of his peers are tak­ing on lead­er­ship roles in the var­i­ous na­tional sports as­so­ci­a­tions (NSA).</p>
    <p>For­mer na­tional sprinter Gary Yeo, who rep­re­sented Sin­ga­pore from 2005 to 2015, is part of Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics’ new man­age­ment com­mit­tee which was elected in Septem­ber. He was pre­vi­ously the ath­letes’ com­mis­sion rep­re­sen­ta­tive but left in March over dif­fer­ences with the pre­vi­ous com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>The 34-year-old felt there was in­suf­fi­cient trans­parency when it came to the se­lec­tion cri­te­ria for cer­tain com­pe­ti­tions dur­ing his time as a na­tional ath­lete.</p>
    <p>He said: “I had a clear vi­sion of what the as­so­ci­a­tion should or should not do and I felt that I couldn’t in­flu­ence it from the out­side nor as ath­letes’ com­mis­sion rep­re­sen­ta­tive. So I de­cided to come in to help the ath­letes train to the best of their abil­i­ties with­out wor­ries and with a fair sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>For Roy Tay and Ge­orge Foo, en­ter­ing the world of of­fi­cial­dom was an op­por­tu­nity to help sail­ing and golf, their re­spec­tive sports, move for­ward.</p>
    <p>Tay, part of the match-rac­ing team that won the gold medal at the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, wanted to tackle the high at­tri­tion rate of sailors who drop out after they fin­ish their stud­ies.</p>
    <p>The 37-year-old said: “A lot of it is look­ing at the struc­tural part of it, look­ing at how we can keep the pipe­line of sail­ing tal­ent, keep the sailors com­ing through from the youth and de­vel­op­ing classes to the se­nior classes.</p>
    <p>“Sail­ing is one of the sports that has be­come known as one that can pro­duce cham­pi­ons, so I’d re­ally like to see how we can keep the</p>
    <p>RIGHT MO­MENT</p>
    <p>If I were to wait un­til I re­tire, I re­ally don’t know how old I would be, what kind of changes I would like to make, so I think this cur­rent op­por­tu­nity is a good one.</p>
    <p>medal tally higher and get more peo­ple through the sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>Foo, 30, has been a mem­ber of the Sin­ga­pore Golf As­so­ci­a­tion’s ex­ec­u­tive board since 2018.</p>
    <p>He spent seven years on the na­tional team and said that ex­pe­ri­ence was help­ful when it comes to tack­ling high-per­for­mance is­sues.</p>
    <p>But he ac­knowl­edged of­fi­cials had to bal­ance dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives and any de­ci­sion re­quired con­sid­er­a­tion of not just ath­letes but other stake­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>One area he looks at is cre­at­ing a vi­able path­way and pre­par­ing na­tional golfers, who are am­a­teurs, to tran­si­tion into the pro­fes­sional cir­cuit.</p>
    <p>Ven­tur­ing into sports ad­min­is­tra­tion is of­ten done after re­tir­ing from the sport but para-swim­mer Yip Pin Xiu gamely shoul­ders both roles. The three-gold Par­a­lympian joined the Sin­ga­pore Dis­abil­ity Sports Coun­cil’s (SDSC) ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee as an in­di­vid­ual mem­ber in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>On why she felt it was the right time to do so, the 28-year-old said: “I per­son­ally don’t see my­self re­tir­ing in the near fu­ture, so the ques­tion is, if not now then when? Be­cause if I were to wait un­til I re­tire, I re­ally don’t know how old I would be, what kind of changes I would like to make, so I think this cur­rent op­por­tu­nity is a good one.”</p>
    <p>Her work as a Nom­i­nated Mem­ber of Par­lia­ment also taught her more about NSAs and SDSC, and that sparked her in­ter­est to join</p>
    <p>the exco.</p>
    <p>Yip, who will be in­volved in the com­mu­nity and par­tic­i­pa­tion port­fo­lios, said: “As an ath­lete, I didn’t know that the SDSC (was) just one NSA han­dling close to 20 sports and that’s a lot to jug­gle.</p>
    <p>“Sport has made a great change in my life pos­i­tively and I want to see it has a sim­i­lar im­pact on oth­ers, es­pe­cially peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties.”</p>
