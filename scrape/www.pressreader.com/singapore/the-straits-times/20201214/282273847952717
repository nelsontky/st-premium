    <p>Out of the 1,100 publi­ca­tions, here are three note­wor­thy ones:</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>Sero­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tion of the Covid-19 in­fec­tion</p>
    <p>Prin­ci­pally led by Wang Linfa</p>
    <p>• Us­ing serol­ogy tests, the study showed links be­tween three clus­ters of Covid-19, com­pris­ing 28 lo­cally trans­mit­ted cases.</p>
    <p>• They were from two churches and a fam­ily gath­er­ing.</p>
    <p>• An in­di­vid­ual from Church A had trans­mit­ted the virus to a pri­mary case from Church B at a fam­ily gath­er­ing they both at­tended.</p>
    <p>• All tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 ex­cept in­di­vid­ual A, who had re­cov­ered and tested neg­a­tive. The in­di­vid­ual was di­ag­nosed with past in­fec­tion us­ing serol­ogy test­ing.</p>
    <p>2 In­ter­ven­tions to mit­i­gate early spread of</p>
    <p>Covid-19 in Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>Us­ing mod­el­ling by Alex Cook</p>
    <p>• Adapted an in­fluenza epi­demic sim­u­la­tion model to es­ti­mate the like­li­hood of Covid-19 trans­mis­sion in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>• Took cu­mu­la­tive in­fec­tions at 80 days, af­ter de­tect­ing 100 cases of com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion, un­der three in­fec­tiv­ity sce­nar­ios, with 7.5 per cent of cases as­sumed asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>• Ran a model with a range of in­ter­ven­tion sce­nar­ios and found that quar­an­tin­ing in­fected in­di­vid­u­als and their fam­ily mem­bers, work­place dis­tanc­ing and school clo­sure once com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion has been de­tected could sig­nif­i­cantly re­duce the num­ber of Covid-19 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore be­comes the third coun­try in the world out­side of China to cul­ture the Sars-CoV-2 virus</p>
    <p>Re­searchers from Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School</p>
    <p>• The team suc­cess­fully cul­tured the coro­n­avirus from an in­fected pa­tient’s sam­ple, just four days af­ter re­ceiv­ing the sam­ple in late Jan­uary, in the med­i­cal school’s con­tain­ment lab­o­ra­tory. • Sin­ga­pore be­comes the third coun­try in the world out­side of China to cul­ture the virus.</p>
    <p>• On Jan 30, Duke-NUS said the cul­tured virus will be used for:</p>
    <p>De­vel­op­ing new di­ag­nos­tic meth­ods</p>
    <p>Mon­i­tor­ing po­ten­tial mu­ta­tion</p>
    <p>Test­ing for po­ten­tial vac­cine and drugs</p>
    <p>• The re­search was done in col­lab­o­ra­tion with sci­en­tists from in­sti­tu­tions such as the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases, Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal and the Min­istry of Health.</p>
