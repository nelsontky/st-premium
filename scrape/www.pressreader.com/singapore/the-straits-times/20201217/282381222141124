    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Gen­nady Golovkin is­sued a warn­ing on Tues­day to Os­car de la Hoya who claimed he wanted to fight the world mid­dleweight cham­pion when he makes an im­prob­a­ble re­turn to boxing.</p>
    <p>The 47-year-old Amer­i­can great an­nounced in Au­gust he plans to come out of re­tire­ment af­ter a 12-year ab­sence from the ring. And re­cently, he said he wanted In­ter­na­tional Boxing Fed­er­a­tion world cham­pion Golovkin, who is more com­monly known by his “Triple G” nick­name, to mark his re­turn.</p>
    <p>“You know how easy ‘ GGG’ would be for me? Oh, my gosh,” De la Hoya told the Boxing Scene web­site last month. “I al­ways took a good shot and I al­ways took apart fight­ers like him. In my mind, it would be that easy.”</p>
    <p>But Golovkin, who is will make a manda­tory de­fence of his ti­tle against un­beaten Pol­ish fighter Kamil Sz­eremeta in Florida to­mor­row, brushed off De La Hoya’s trash talk.</p>
    <p>“You know Os­car, you know how dirty his mouth is,” the 38-year-old Kazakh said through a trans­la­tor when asked if he took De La Hoya’s chal­lenge se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­thing in­volv­ing Gen­nady Golovkin for him is a night­mare. He can say what­ever. But let me put it this way – If I got an op­por­tu­nity to legally kill a per­son in the ring, I might seize it.”</p>
    <p>On lu­cra­tive ex­hi­bi­tions – Mike Tyson took on Roy Jones Jr while Floyd May­weather is set to fight YouTube per­son­al­ity Lo­gan Paul in Fe­bru­ary – Golovkin did not rule out tak­ing part but in­sisted he had le­git­i­mate fights to take care of first.</p>
    <p>He said: “Right now, I’m in my pro­fes­sional boxing ca­reer and I don’t see the need for that my­self.</p>
    <p>But in fu­ture, if there is a de­mand and an in­ter­est, then why not?”</p>
    <p>The sole blem­ish on the Kazakh’s 42-fight record re­mains the ma­jor­ity loss to Mex­i­can multi-weight cham­pion Saul “Canelo” Al­varez in 2018.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, De La Hoya has not fought since be­ing dis­man­tled by Filipino Manny Pac­quiao in eight one-sided rounds in 2008.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the 1992 Barcelona Olympics gold medal­list said he is se­ri­ous about a come­back, telling ESPN in Au­gust he was ready to fight “any top guy” avail­able.</p>
    <p>De La Hoya set up one of boxing’s big­gest pro­mo­tions, Golden Boy, af­ter end­ing his ca­reer and was part of the ac­ri­mo­nious buildup to Golovkin’s two bouts with Canelo.</p>
