    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans must work to­gether and stay united to meet the chal­lenges in a world se­ri­ously dis­rupted by Covid-19, said Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Madam Hal­imah said the huge turnout of vot­ers on Polling Day au­gurs well for Sin­ga­pore be­cause it shows that Sin­ga­pore­ans take their right to vote se­ri­ously, and want to par­tic­i­pate ac­tively in the demo­cratic process.</p>
    <p>How­ever, now that the elec­tion is over, she urged every­one to work to­gether and stay united to meet the chal­lenges ahead.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Hal­imah said: “Our progress has been achieved through the sheer hard work of our peo­ple work­ing closely with the Gov­ern­ment through many years. In this way, we over­came many crises to­gether that would have over­whelmed a lesser peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>“We know that no­body owes us a liv­ing and that we need to prove our value and worth for the world to take us se­ri­ously,” she added.</p>
    <p>At the close of polls last Fri­day, 96 per cent of reg­is­tered vot­ers – over 2.5 mil­lion peo­ple – had cast their bal­lots. The Elec­tions Depart­ment had said this turnout was higher than in the 2015 Gen­eral Elec­tion, in which more than 2.3 mil­lion votes were cast – or nearly 94 per cent of reg­is­tered vot­ers.</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah’s com­ments come just as the Trade and In­dus­try Min­istry re­leased its ad­vance es­ti­mates yes­ter­day, which showed that Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy con­tracted 41.2 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter from the pre­vi­ous three months. Over­all, Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy is ex­pected to shrink by be­tween 4 and 7 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>In her post, Madam Hal­imah said that in a world se­ri­ously dis­rupted by Covid-19, every coun­try will be look­ing at ways to grow its econ­omy to catch a slice of the pie.</p>
    <p>She added that this is “no mean task” in a world that was al­ready shrink­ing in space be­fore Covid-19, due to the pres­sures of de­glob­al­i­sa­tion, in­su­lar and rigid forms of na­tion­al­ism, weak in­ter­na­tional in­sti­tu­tions and su­per­power ten­sions.</p>
    <p>De­spite this, Madam Hal­imah said, “op­por­tu­ni­ties still abound for those with in­no­va­tive ideas, and who dare to change and de­velop new ca­pa­bil­i­ties”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, all hands are needed on deck to help the coun­try nav­i­gate this cri­sis, ex­plore new solutions and strate­gies, and carve a niche for it­self, she said. “Every­one has a stake in this coun­try and it is up to us to make Sin­ga­pore a bet­ter place,” she added.</p>
    <p>Said Madam Hal­imah: “I am glad that the var­i­ous po­lit­i­cal lead­ers have pledged to work to­gether for the good of Sin­ga­pore. I look for­ward to work­ing with the new team in this next chap­ter of Sin­ga­pore’s his­tory.”</p>
    <p>The rul­ing Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party se­cured 61.24 per cent of votes, and 83 seats out of 93 in the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion Work­ers’ Party made fur­ther in­roads into Par­lia­ment by win­ning the Sengkang group rep­re­sen­ta­tion con­stituency, and hold­ing on to Alju­nied GRC and the Hougang sin­gle-mem­ber con­stituency.</p>
    <p>The episode showed that he would fight to max­imise the ben­e­fits for work­ers but still ad­dress the con­cerns of em­ploy­ers.”</p>
    <p>Health­care Ser­vices Employees’ Union pres­i­dent and for­mer Nom­i­nated MP K. Thanaletch­imi said since both the PAP and NTUC have a sym­bi­otic re­la­tion­ship, the Gov­ern­ment will con­tinue to give im­por­tance to work­ers, even if the labour chief is not a min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>She saw no rea­son why NTUC’s sta­tus will be re­duced, adding: “Bear in mind that two deputy sec­re­taries-gen­eral (Se­nior Min­is­ters of State Koh Poh Koon and Heng Chee How) are in the Gov­ern­ment, and we have labour MPs who can speak openly in Par­lia­ment.”</p>
    <p>Still, the sit­u­a­tion will be a “true lit­mus test” of the sym­bi­otic re­la­tion­ship and tri­par­tism, added Ms Thanaletch­imi, who is also an NTUC vice-pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal observer Felix Tan, an as­so­ciate lec­turer at SIM Global Ed­u­ca­tion, said Mr Ng’s net­work would still be valu­able within the tri­par­tite ar­range­ment. But he said NTUC’s move may send a con­fus­ing sig­nal to Sin­ga­pore­ans as it raises ques­tions about why, for the past 40 years, a Cabi­net min­is­ter – in­stead of oth­ers within NTUC – needed to be sec­re­tary-gen­eral.</p>
    <p>Cap­tain Ken­neth Lai, pres­i­dent of the Air Line Pi­lots As­so­ci­a­tion – Sin­ga­pore, which is a union not af­fil­i­ated with NTUC, said he ap­pre­ci­ated how Mr Ng lis­tened to his as­so­ci­a­tion’s feed­back about the se­vere im­pact of Covid-19 on the avi­a­tion clus­ter, which was later ad­dressed in the Bud­get.</p>
    <p>He added that Mr Ng’s con­tin­ued en­thu­si­asm since los­ing the elec­tion shows he is gen­uine.</p>
