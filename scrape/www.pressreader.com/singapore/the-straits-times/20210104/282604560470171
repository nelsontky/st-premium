    <p>CHECK IN ON THEIR MEN­TAL HEALTH</p>
    <p>Talk to your chil­dren about what to ex­pect for the new school year and ad­dress their con­cerns without judg­ment. You can also try cre­at­ing a fam­ily project in which each per­son draws or writes about how he will get ready for the new year.</p>
    <p>Younger chil­dren who may not be able to ex­press them­selves well can com­mu­ni­cate their feel­ings through pic­tures, which you can share with their teach­ers if they have chal­lenges in school.</p>
    <p>INSPIRE POS­I­TIVE FEEL­INGS ABOUT SCHOOL</p>
    <p>Telling young chil­dren that the teacher will scold them or their friends will not like them, if they are naughty, only breeds fear. En­cour­age them to do their best and praise good be­hav­iour in­stead.</p>
    <p>Kids are of­ten ex­cited to talk about their ex­pe­ri­ences when school starts, so give them your full at­ten­tion. You can also share pos­i­tive sto­ries and show them pho­tos of your school days.</p>
    <p>STAY CALM</p>
    <p>If your child is start­ing child­care or pri­mary school, chances are you may be more anxious than your lit­tle one. Kids are sen­si­tive to their par­ents’ feel­ings, so learn to man­age your emo­tions first and do not put un­due pres­sure on them.</p>
    <p>SET UP A TIMETABLE</p>
    <p>A rou­tine sched­ule of ac­tiv­i­ties – one for week­days and one for week­ends – gives chil­dren the struc­ture they need. Work with your child to plan it.</p>
    <p>GET ENOUGH SLEEP</p>
    <p>It is of­ten over­looked, but ad­e­quate sleep makes a huge dif­fer­ence to chil­dren’s devel­op­ment – from growth hor­mones to im­mu­nity to at­ten­tion span.</p>
    <p>Kids aged three to five should sleep about 10 to 13 hours a day, in­clud­ing naps. Pri­mary school pupils need about nine to 12 hours of shut-eye, which means bed­time by 9pm. Limit screen time be­fore bed as stud­ies have shown it af­fects the qual­ity of sleep.</p>
    <p>SET GOALS</p>
    <p>Ask your chil­dren what they hope to ac­com­plish in the new year, for ex­am­ple, get­ting to know two new friends a week or read­ing five to 10 books a month. Such goals help mo­ti­vate them to start good habits and give you op­por­tu­ni­ties to af­firm their ef­forts and progress.</p>
