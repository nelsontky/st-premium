    <p>HAPPY BIRTH­DAY, ALAN TAM:</p>
    <p>Hong Kong vet­eran singer Alan Tam (right) man­aged to shed al­most 9kg in a month due to fre­quent work­outs. How­ever, it looks like the Can­topop icon may not be able to keep up his ef­forts as he turns 70 on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, he posted on Weibo two pho­tos of him­self cut­ting a birth­day cake topped with the words: “Happy birth­day, Prin­ci­pal.”</p>
    <p>The singer – known af­fec­tion­ately as Prin­ci­pal Tam due to his stature in the in­dus­try – wrote in Chi­nese: “I re­ceived my first birth­day cake from Dun­can, who sent it on be­half of Uni­ver­sal Mu­sic yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“In the past, I would have re­ceived more than 20 cakes from early</p>
    <p>July till now, but with six days to go, I be­lieve I will be stuffed with cakes in the next two days.</p>
    <p>“It looks like my weight will bounce back after los­ing al­most 9kg in the last four weeks.”</p>
    <p>But it ap­pears he will not be giv­ing up with­out a fight: He went for a jog yes­ter­day. He posted three pho­tos of him­self on Weibo after com­plet­ing his runs, which he de­scribed as good and re­fresh­ing.</p>
    <p>Tam closed his In­sta­gram and Face­book ac­counts last month after he re­ceived flak for pub­licly back­ing the Hong Kong po­lice and at­tend­ing a pro-po­lice rally in June last year dur­ing the anti-govern­ment protests.</p>
    <p>He was slammed in Fe­bru­ary after he was seen, along with sev­eral other Hong Kong stars in­clud­ing ac­tors Jackie Chan and Eric Tsang, at a ban­quet with Hong Kong po­lice of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>They drew fur­ther ire from ne­ti­zens as they were not wear­ing masks de­spite the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
