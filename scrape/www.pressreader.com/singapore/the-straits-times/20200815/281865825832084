    <p>The move by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion to des­ig­nate China’s Con­fu­cius In­sti­tute as a for­eign mis­sion is aimed at both de­mon­is­ing and stig­ma­tis­ing nor­mal op­er­a­tions of the lan­guage cen­tres, an av­enue of co­op­er­a­tion be­tween both sides, Bei­jing said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We ex­press our strong dis­sat­is­fac­tion and res­o­lute op­po­si­tion to this,” For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Lijian said, adding that Bei­jing re­served the right to re­spond.</p>
    <p>Speaking at a reg­u­lar press brief­ing, Mr Zhao said Wash­ing­ton’s ac­tions were mo­ti­vated by “ide­o­log­i­cal prej­u­dice and self-in­ter­est” and were un­ac­cept­able, adding that the Con­fu­cius In­sti­tute cen­tres were a bridge to help peo­ple learn Chi­nese and un­der­stand China, and have contribute­d pos­i­tively to cul­tural ex­change be­tween the US and China.</p>
    <p>The Con­fu­cius In­sti­tute is funded by the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment and the latest salvo from Wash­ing­ton comes as ties be­tween the two giants con­tinue to sour over is­sues in­clud­ing es­pi­onage, trade and tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, nine Chi­nese me­dia out­lets were also des­ig­nated as “for­eign mis­sions” after Wash­ing­ton ac­cused them of fur­ther­ing China’s pro­pa­ganda aims.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing yes­ter­day urged the United States to aban­don its “Cold War zero-sum mind­set”.</p>
    <p>“Stop politi­cis­ing these ed­u­ca­tional ex­change pro­grammes, in­ter­fer­ing with nor­mal cul­tural ex­changes be­tween China and the United States, and dam­ag­ing mu­tual trust and co­op­er­a­tion be­tween China and the US,” said Mr Zhao.</p>
    <p>The US has long viewed Con­fu­cius In­sti­tute cen­tres, many of which op­er­ate i n part­ner­ships with lo­cal uni­ver­si­ties to teach the Chi­nese lan­guage and pro­mote Chi­nese cul­ture, as a soft power tool of Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Recog­nis­ing the grow­ing crit­i­cism, China has sought to re­brand the Con­fu­cius In­sti­tute. Chi­nese me­dia re­ported last month that op­er­a­tions of the Con­fu­cius In­sti­tute will be trans­ferred to a non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion called the Chi­nese In­ter­na­tional Education Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>Na­tion­al­ist tabloid Global Times de­nounced the move to have Con­fu­cius In­sti­tute cen­tres reg­is­tered as for­eign mis­sions, say­ing it will have an “ex­ten­sive and long-term im­pact” and cause uni­ver­si­ties to be hes­i­tant about co­op­er­at­ing with them.</p>
    <p>“The US is the most petty-minded of all big pow­ers. Many Western coun­tries have Con­fu­cius In­sti­tutes, but only the US, the world’s sole su­per­power, feels threat­ened. Where is the US’ con­fi­dence? Where is its cul­tural tol­er­ance?” it said in an edi­to­rial yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Re­act­ing to the latest developmen­ts, Chi­nese ex­perts said that Wash­ing­ton was clearly out to push back against China’s pro­jec­tion of soft power in the US.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­changes be­tween both sides have also been a ca­su­alty as ties worsen.</p>
    <p>This year, the US can­celled its Ful­bright ex­change pro­gramme in China and Hong Kong as well as the Peace Corps pro­gramme where Amer­i­can vol­un­teers visit China to teach English to Chi­nese stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Ren­min Univer­sity in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions pro­fes­sor Shi Yin­hong, who ex­pects China to take re­tal­ia­tory mea­sures, said: “Trump’s di­rec­tion is very clear – he wants to re­strict China’s soft power pro­jec­tion... He is go­ing against all tra­di­tional US pol­icy against China.”</p>
