        <p>Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon, in giv­ing his first com­ments on the Parti Liyani case, said yes­ter­day that a sound sys­tem of jus­tice be­gins with the se­lec­tion of judges – but they are not in­fal­li­ble. Cor­rec­tive pro­ce­dures are in place – and work well – to set right what might have ini­tially gone amiss, he said at the open­ing of the le­gal year.</p>
        <p>Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon, in giv­ing his first com­ments on the high-pro­file Parti Liyani case, said yes­ter­day that a sound sys­tem of jus­tice be­gins with the se­lec­tion of judges – but they are not in­fal­li­ble.</p>
        <p>How­ever, cor­rec­tive pro­ce­dures such as ap­peals are in place – and work well – to set right what might have ini­tially gone amiss, he said in his speech to mark the open­ing of the le­gal year.</p>
        <p>The an­nual event was con­ducted via video con­fer­ence for the first time.</p>
        <p>Chief Jus­tice Menon, At­tor­neyGen­eral Lu­cien Wong and Law So­ci­ety pres­i­dent Gre­gory Vi­jayen­dran de­liv­ered their cus­tom­ary speeches from the State Courts’ Have­lock Hall, with the pro­ceed­ings live-streamed to about 1,000 par­tic­i­pants.</p>
        <p>The case of Ms Parti, a for­mer do­mes­tic worker who was ac­cused of steal­ing from the fam­ily of her em­ployer, was men­tioned by all three speak­ers.</p>
        <p>Ms Parti was ini­tially con­victed by a State Courts judge fol­low­ing a trial, but last Septem­ber, High Court judge Chan Seng Onn al­lowed her ap­peal and ac­quit­ted her. The case sparked pub­lic out­cry, which led to a marathon nine­hour par­lia­men­tary de­bate over the fair­ness of the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem.</p>
        <p>In his speech, the Chief Jus­tice said the quest for a sound sys­tem of jus­tice be­gins with the se­lec­tion of judges with the ap­pro­pri­ate tem­per­a­ment, abil­ity, and in­tegrity and com­mit­ment to carry out their heavy re­spon­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
        <p>Even so, judges are not in­fal­li­ble. “That is pre­cisely why vir­tu­ally all ju­di­cial struc­tures in the world in­cor­po­rate a sys­tem of cor­rec­tive pro­ce­dures such as ap­peals, so that where some­thing might have gone amiss at first in­stance, there is the op­por­tu­nity to set it right,” he said.</p>
        <p>“Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn was con­fronted with that re­spon­si­bil­ity in Ms Parti Liyani’s case. He care­fully scru­ti­nised the ev­i­dence that had been led, the ar­gu­ments that were ad­vanced be­fore him and the judg­ment of the trial court, and ar­rived at his de­ci­sion for rea­sons that he ex­plained in con­sid­er­able de­tail.”</p>
        <p>How­ever, the Chief Jus­tice added that “we must con­stantly look be­yond the fact that we have cor­rec­tive court pro­ce­dures that work well”. Thus, the ju­di­ciary has also been work­ing on en­hanc­ing train­ing and de­vel­op­ment programmes for judges and ju­di­cial of­fi­cers in re­cent years.</p>
        <p>The Sin­ga­pore Ju­di­cial Col­lege, which was founded in 2015, is now an in­te­gral part of the ju­di­ciary, run­ning a grow­ing cal­en­dar of programmes and de­vel­op­ing a com­pe­tency frame­work to en­hance train­ing of ju­di­cial of­fi­cers.</p>
        <p>Ju­di­cial of­fi­cers i n the State Courts and Fam­ily Jus­tice Courts will also have more op­por­tu­ni­ties to be men­tored by High Court judges, he said.</p>
        <p>The Chief Jus­tice stressed: “Judges and pros­e­cu­tors serve no</p>
        <p>com­mer­cial in­ter­est. The only in­ter­est they serve is to do right by the law.”</p>
        <p>He said the State Courts, which serve as the gate­way to the jus­tice sys­tem for most lit­i­gants in Sin­ga­pore, have done out­stand­ing work over the years.</p>
        <p>Giv­ing a sense of their work­load, he said that in 2019, close to 110,000 cases from the crim­i­nal jus­tice, civil jus­tice, and com­mu­nity jus­tice and tri­bunals di­vi­sions were at­tended to by 91 ju­di­cial of­fi­cers.</p>
        <p>In the most re­cent sur­vey of court users, all the re­spon­dents agreed that the State Courts ad­min­is­ter jus­tice fairly re­gard­less of race, lan­guage or re­li­gion, while 99 per cent agreed that the State Courts dis­pense jus­tice in­de­pen­dently ac­cord­ing to the law.</p>
        <p>“We may har­bour strong views about a given case, but when all is said and done, it goes with­out say­ing that we must re­spect the fi­nal ju­di­cial out­come be­cause, whether or not one agrees with a de­ci­sion, the process that cul­mi­nates in it af­fords us the best means we have for re­solv­ing our dif­fer­ences in a way that is fair, hon­est and con­duces to or­derly re­la­tions.”</p>
        <p>The Chief Jus­tice added that it was “un­help­ful” and “an­ti­thet­i­cal to due process” to pre­ma­turely con­demn er­rors in the ju­di­cial process as sug­ges­tive of bad faith or im­pro­pri­ety.</p>
        <p>“Where there is rea­son to think that there might have been mis­con­duct, steps will be taken in ac­cor­dance with the ap­pli­ca­ble pro­cesses, and th­ese must be al­lowed to take their course.”</p>
        <p>In his speech, the Chief Jus­tice also de­tailed the ju­di­ciary’s re­sponse to the pan­demic and his views on the post-pan­demic le­gal land­scape.</p>
        <p>He said: “The pace with which the courts and the profession suc­cess­fully piv­oted to re­mote hear­ings demon­strates that we can lever­age tech­nol­ogy to op­ti­mise our pro­cesses.”</p>
        <p>How­ever, he stressed the ne­ces­sity of re­main­ing sen­si­tive to the needs of those who are less tech­no­log­i­cally equipped.</p>
        <p>The eco­nomic im­pact of the pan­demic also ac­cen­tu­ates the need for a shift towards “peace build­ing” al­ter­na­tive dis­pute res­o­lu­tion pro­cesses, he said.</p>
        <p>STEPS TO COR­RECT ER­RORS</p>
        <p>Where there is rea­son to think that there might have been mis­con­duct, steps will be taken in ac­cor­dance with the ap­pli­ca­ble pro­cesses, and th­ese must be al­lowed to take their course.</p>
