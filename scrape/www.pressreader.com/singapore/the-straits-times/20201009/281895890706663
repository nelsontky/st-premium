    <p>Thai pro­test­ers have com­plained about the cost of the King’s stays in Europe as well as his ab­sence from the king­dom. The pro­test­ers seek to re­duce the King’s pow­ers un­der the Con­sti­tu­tion, which specif­i­cally al­lows him to ex­er­cise pow­ers when he is out­side</p>
    <p>Thai­land with­out ap­point­ing a re­gent.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>BERLIN Ger­many’s for­eign min­is­ter has said Thai­land’s King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn should not be con­duct­ing pol­i­tics from the Euro­pean coun­try, where he spends much of his time.</p>
    <p>For­eign Min­is­ter Heiko Maas re­sponded to a ques­tion by a Greens</p>
    <p>MP in the Bun­destag on Wed­nes­day at a time when King Va­ji­ra­longkorn’s monar­chy faces un­prece­dented calls for re­form from pro­test­ers in Thai­land.</p>
    <p>“We have made it clear that pol­i­tics con­cern­ing Thai­land should not be con­ducted from Ger­man soil,” Mr Maas told Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>“If there are guests in our coun­try that con­duct their state business from our soil, we would al­ways want to act to coun­ter­act that.”</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of pro­test­ers have been hold­ing demon­stra­tions in Bangkok over re­cent months, call­ing for re­form of the monar­chy to curb the King’s pow­ers and for the re­moval of Thai Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha, a for­mer junta leader, and for a new Con­sti­tu­tion and elec­tions.</p>
    <p>Greens par­lia­men­tar­ian Frithjof Sch­midt also asked Mr Maas whether Ger­many was pre­pared to dis­cuss with the Euro­pean Union the freez­ing of free trade talks with Thai­land again “as long as the junta con­tin­ues to block the path to democ­racy in Thai­land”.</p>
    <p>The EU halted con­tact at all lev­els with Thai­land af­ter a 2014 coup – led by Mr Prayut – but re­sumed trade talks af­ter a gen­eral elec­tion last year that saw Mr Prayut re­in­stated as a civil­ian prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Maas said halt­ing ne­go­ti­a­tions was an op­tion to ex­ert pres­sure, but it would be right to dis­cuss with Thai­land first.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers chal­leng­ing Thai­land’s palace and army-dom­i­nated es­tab­lish­ment broke a long­stand­ing taboo by de­mand­ing re­form of the monar­chy in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>King Va­ji­ra­longkorn, 68, has been on Thai­land’s throne since 2016, but spends much of his time in the Ger­man state of Bavaria, where his 15-year-old son is at school.</p>
    <p>Thai pro­test­ers have com­plained about the cost of the King’s stays in Europe as well as his ab­sence from the king­dom.</p>
    <p>The pro­test­ers seek to re­duce the King’s pow­ers un­der the Con­sti­tu­tion, which specif­i­cally al­lows him to ex­er­cise pow­ers when he is out­side Thai­land with­out ap­point­ing a re­gent.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers also want to re­move his di­rect con­trol of a royal for­tune val­ued in tens of bil­lions of dol­lars and some units of the army. The Thai palace has made no com­ment on the protests.</p>
    <p>In the Ger­man Par­lia­ment, Mr Sch­midt asked: “Why does the Ger­man gov­ern­ment tol­er­ate this ex­tremely un­usual – and in my opinion il­le­gal – be­hav­iour of a for­eign head of state con­duct­ing pol­i­tics on Ger­man soil?”</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers in Thai­land yes­ter­day said they would rally again next Wed­nes­day and that they ex­pected a big turnout to pres­sure the gov­ern­ment to step down, as well as to press their calls for re­form of the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers, rep­re­sent­ing sev­eral youth-led groups, said they ex­pected the protest to draw some 100,000 peo­ple, or twice as many par­tic­i­pants as a demon­stra­tion last month.</p>
