    <p>claimed was poi­son­ing, although the au­thor­i­ties dis­missed that com­plaint as merely an “al­ler­gic re­ac­tion”.</p>
    <p>Yet, noth­ing has stopped Mr Navalny’s rise to the po­si­tion of Rus­sia’s most sub­stan­tial op­po­si­tion leader.</p>
    <p>The se­cret of his suc­cess is that, un­like other op­po­si­tion lead­ers, he is an at­trac­tive pub­lic speaker who can re­late to or­di­nary peo­ple and has a knack for catchy phrases: His dis­missal of the rul­ing United Rus­sia party, Mr Putin’s po­lit­i­cal move­ment, as “the party of crooks and thieves” is a jibe that has stuck and that the au­thor­i­ties have never suc­ceeded in shak­ing off.</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny is also a re­source­ful politi­cian: His lat­est tech­nique of us­ing re­mote-con­trolled drones to pho­to­graph the vast prop­er­ties that mem­bers of Rus­sia’s po­lit­i­cal elite own in var­i­ous out-of-bounds ar­eas out­side Moscow and then post­ing the videos on­line has se­verely rat­tled the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>No de­tails have been re­leased about the chem­i­cal sub­stance that he seems to have in­gested in the tea he drank at the air­port be­fore board­ing the plane.</p>
    <p>But his sup­port­ers claim that the Rus­sian au­thor­i­ties’ re­fusal to au­tho­rise his im­me­di­ate move to a Ger­man hos­pi­tal is de­signed to gain time un­til the poi­son dis­ap­pears from his di­ges­tive sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Ei­ther way, the episode is the lat­est in a se­ries of high-pro­file mur­der­ous at­tacks on op­po­si­tion fig­ures and dis­si­dents.</p>
    <p>These in­clude the gun­ning down of lead­ing op­po­si­tion jour­nal­ist Anna Politkovsk­aya in 2006, the shoot­ing of op­po­si­tion politi­cian Boris Nemtsov in 2015 and the 2018 poi­son­ing of Mr Sergei Skri­pal, a for­mer Rus­sian spy who de­fected to Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>On each oc­ca­sion, the vic­tims were se­nior op­po­nents of the regime, but no se­ri­ous in­ves­ti­ga­tions re­sulted and no cul­prits were ever found.</p>
    <p>The Rus­sian au­thor­i­ties deny any re­spon­si­bil­ity for Mr Navalny’s con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>“Just like any cit­i­zen of our coun­try, we wish him a speedy re­cov­ery”, said Mr Dmitry Peskov, the Rus­sian Pres­i­dent’s chief spokesman.</p>
    <p>But op­po­si­tion lead­ers claim that with pop­u­lar demon­stra­tions against a pro-Rus­sian govern­ment in neigh­bour­ing Be­larus now in full swing, the au­thor­i­ties may have an in­ter­est in si­lenc­ing Mr Navalny, as they fear sim­i­lar protests in Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>Anti-govern­ment demon­stra­tions are also tak­ing place in Rus­sia’s far eastern prov­inces of Siberia, the ar­eas Mr Navalny has just vis­ited.</p>
    <p>It is pos­si­ble that the ob­jec­tive of the at­tack may not nec­es­sar­ily be to elim­i­nate Mr Navalny, but just to frighten him into sub­mis­sion by re­mind­ing him that he is a mere mor­tal.</p>
    <p>How­ever, if there is one cer­tainty about the episode, it’s that should Alexei Navalny stage a full re­cov­ery, he will be an even greater thorn in the Rus­sian govern­ment’s side.</p>
