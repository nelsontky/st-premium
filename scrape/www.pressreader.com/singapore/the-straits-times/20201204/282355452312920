    <p>The Hous­ton Rock­ets made a block­buster deal on Wed­nes­day, trad­ing the dis­grun­tled Rus­sell West­brook to Wash­ing­ton Wizards for John Wall.</p>
    <p>In an ex­change of Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) All-Star point guards, the Rock­ets also re­ceived a lottery-pro­tected firstround draft pick, which ac­cord­ing to The Ath­letic is for 2023.</p>
    <p>West­brook re­port­edly be­came dis­mayed with the di­rec­tion of the or­gan­i­sa­tion af­ter the re­cent depar­tures of coach Mike D’An­toni and gen­eral man­ager Daryl Morey.</p>
    <p>But he may not be the last player out of the door, with fel­low All-Star James Harden, who has been the league’s lead­ing scorer for the past three sea­sons, re­port­edly also ea­ger to move on.</p>
    <p>West­brook av­er­aged 27.2 points, 7.9 re­bounds and seven as­sists in 57 games with the Rock­ets in his only season with the fran­chise.</p>
    <p>He was ac­quired from the Ok­la­homa City Thun­der as part of a deal that sent point guard Chris Paul the other way in July last year.</p>
    <p>The 32-year-old will now be re­united with Scott Brooks, who was the Thun­der coach for all but 13 games of West­brook’s first seven sea­sons with that fran­chise.</p>
    <p>“Rus­sell’s ac­com­plish­ments and hon­ours on the court speak for them­selves, but his drive and will to win are what sep­a­rate him as a truly unique player,” Brooks said.</p>
    <p>“As much as I’m look­ing for­ward to reuniting with him, I’m equally sad to say good­bye to John. He is one of the tough­est and most gifted players I’ve ever been around and we all wish him noth­ing but the best mov­ing for­ward.”</p>
    <p>Wizards gen­eral man­ager Tommy Shep­pard added: “Hav­ing the op­por­tu­nity to ac­quire a player of Rus­sell’s cal­i­bre and char­ac­ter was some­thing that we could not pass up when look­ing at both the im­me­di­ate and long-term fu­ture of our team.</p>
    <p>“With that said, the de­ci­sion to part ways with John was ex­tremely dif­fi­cult. What he has meant to our or­gan­i­sa­tion and our com­mu­nity is im­mea­sur­able.”</p>
    <p>West­brook, the 2016-17 Most Valu­able Player, is slated to make US$41.4 mil­lion (S$55.3 mil­lion) this term, while Wall, 30, is set to earn US$41.25 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Wall has not played since De­cem­ber 2018 due to in­juries, miss­ing the whole of last season be­cause of a rup­tured Achilles ten­don.</p>
    <p>The No. 1 over­all pick in the 2010 NBA Draft, Wall is Wash­ing­ton’s all-time leader in steals (976) and as­sists (5,282) and ranks fourth in points (10,879).</p>
