    <p>The first ex­ec­u­tive con­do­minium (EC) site in Ten­gah and a condo site in Ang Mo Kio were launched for sale yes­ter­day un­der the sec­ond half of the 2020 govern­ment land sales (GLS) pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Both res­i­den­tial sites are on the con­firmed list, which was re­leased in June.</p>
    <p>The two sites com­bined can yield about 985 res­i­den­tial units, al­though the ac­tual num­ber may vary de­pend­ing on the de­vel­op­ers, said the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Author­ity (URA) and the Hous­ing Board (HDB) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Sites on the con­firmed list are launched ac­cord­ing to sched­ule, re­gard­less of de­mand.</p>
    <p>The Ten­gah par­cel in Ten­gah Gar­den Walk has a site area of 22,020 sq m and a max­i­mum gross floor area (GFA) of 61,659 sq m. The 99-year lease­hold site is ex­pected to yield about 615 EC units.</p>
    <p>Lo­cated next to the up­com­ing Gar­den Vines @ Ten­gah Build-ToOrder project, it will be the first EC hous­ing project in the “for­est town” of Ten­gah.</p>
    <p>JLL se­nior di­rec­tor of re­search and con­sul­tancy Ong Teck Hui said de­vel­op­ers are likely to view the EC mar­ket “favourably”, as there are only four EC projects in the launch pipe­line.</p>
    <p>“While the Ten­gah plot is in a rel­a­tively less de­vel­oped area, it could be in fair de­mand due to the lack of new EC projects in the west and could of­fer first-mover ad­van­tage to the suc­cess­ful bid­der,” said Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>ERA Realty’s head of re­search and con­sul­tancy Ni­cholas Mak es­ti­mated that the site could at­tract six to nine bids, with the top bid vary­ing from $331.8 mil­lion to $352 mil­lion, which trans­lates to $500 to $530 per sq ft per plot ra­tio (psf ppr).</p>
    <p>The land par­cel in Ang Mo Kio is lo­cated in Ang Mo Kio Av­enue 1, with a site area of 12,679 sq m and a GFA of 31,699 sq m. The 99-year lease­hold site is es­ti­mated to yield around 370 units.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong Siew Ying, PropNex’s head of re­search and con­tent, noted that it is the lat­est GLS site to be of­fered in the area in six years.</p>
    <p>She said that apart from be­ing in a ma­ture town and an es­tab­lished res­i­den­tial area, the plot is also near the up­com­ing Mayflower MRT sta­tion on the Thom­son-East Coast Line.</p>
    <p>She ex­pects de­mand for the site to be “buoy­ant” and that it would at­tract more than 10 bid­ders, with the top bid at $273 mil­lion to $290 mil­lion, or $800 to $850 psf ppr.</p>
    <p>URA and HDB will of­fer a longer ten­der pe­riod of six months to al­low de­vel­op­ers more time to make their as­sess­ment in view of the on­go­ing Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Ten­der for the two land parcels will close at noon on May 25 next year.</p>
