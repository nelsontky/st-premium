    <p>A for­mer Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces (SAF) reg­u­lar was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to 7½ years’ jail and six strokes of the cane for mo­lest­ing a girl and at­tempt­ing to mo­lest another vic­tim four months later.</p>
    <p>Mo­hamed Ardlee Iriandee Mo­hamed Sa­nip was con­victed on Feb 27, fol­low­ing a trial, of mo­lest­ing an eight-year-old girl in Jan­uary 2018.</p>
    <p>On March 23, he ad­mit­ted in court that he had tried to mo­lest a 10-year-old girl in May that year as well. The two girls can­not be named ow­ing to a gag or­der.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments did not dis­close Ardlee’s rank and role at the Safti Mil­i­tary In­sti­tute – his de­ploy­ment at the time of the of­fences.</p>
    <p>Be­fore sen­tenc­ing Ardlee yes­ter­day, District Judge John Ng noted that the 40-year-old was a first­time of­fender, but added that his of­fences were “very se­ri­ous” and they in­volved young school­girls.</p>
    <p>The judge said the pun­ish­ment should be se­vere enough to “re­flect the con­dem­na­tion” of such acts.</p>
    <p>In her sub­mis­sions, Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Sruthi Bop­pana stated that Ardlee had de­vel­oped an in­ter­est in young girls a month be­fore tar­get­ing the first vic­tim.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tor added that Ardlee was also “pre­dis­posed to thoughts of mo­lest­ing them, and had thought of do­ing so by wait­ing near pri­mary schools for op­por­tu­ni­ties”.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim and a friend were walk­ing back from school at about 3pm on Jan 22, 2018, when they spot­ted Ardlee at a Hous­ing Board block in Tampines where the friend’s grand­par­ents live.</p>
    <p>Af­ter walk­ing her friend to her flat, the vic­tim was near a lift lobby when Ardlee grabbed her hand and mo­lested her. He re­leased her only af­ter she told him sev­eral times to stop. She re­turned to her friend’s flat, and the po­lice were alerted.</p>
    <p>Ardlee struck again on May 21 that year, when he at­tempted to mo­lest a 10-year-old girl in Choa Chu Kang. She was on her way home from school and had en­tered a lift alone. When she reached the sec­ond storey, she saw Ardlee stand­ing out­side.</p>
    <p>When he pulled her to­wards the cor­ner of a stair­case land­ing area, she started scream­ing. Ardlee re­leased her and fled.</p>
    <p>The girl re­turned home and told her aunt about the in­ci­dent. Ardlee was ar­rested the next day.</p>
    <p>Ardlee is now out on bail of $30,000 and was or­dered to sur­ren­der him­self at the State Courts on Nov 2 to be­gin serv­ing his sen­tence.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of De­fence yes­ter­day said that the SAF had dis­charged him from ser­vice.</p>
    <p>“The Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces holds its ser­vice­men to high stan­dards of dis­ci­pline and in­tegrity, and ex­pects them to abide by the law. Those who com­mit of­fences will be dealt with in ac­cor­dance with the law,” it added.</p>
    <p>For each charge, of­fend­ers con­victed of mo­lest­ing a child be­low 14 years old can be jailed for up to 10 years and caned.</p>
