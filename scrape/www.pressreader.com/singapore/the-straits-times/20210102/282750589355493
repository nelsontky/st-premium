    <p>It has been chron­i­cling the peo­ple’s sense of iden­tity and no­tions of what is quintessen­tially “home”.</p>
    <p>“We have cap­tured these in sto­ries and also in vi­su­als – pho­tos, and now also in­creas­ingly on video. This show­case fea­tures high­lights of these ef­forts over the years, and will be both nos­tal­gic as well as stir­ring and in­spir­ing,” he says.</p>
    <p>Vet­eran ST pho­to­jour­nal­ist Stephanie Yeow re­calls her as­sign­ment in Palem­bang to cover the burial of the vic­tims on Jan 19, 1998 – a year af­ter the SilkAir crash.</p>
    <p>“It was a very quiet and som­bre cer­e­mony filled with in­di­vid­ual prayers and re­flec­tion,” says the 49-year-old, who saw loved ones throw flow­ers into the mass gravesite while some just stared blankly at the heart­break­ing sight.</p>
    <p>“It’s never pleas­ant or easy cov­er­ing dis­as­ters with mourn­ing fam­ily mem­bers. I felt a deep sad­ness.”</p>
    <p>“When­ever I see im­ages taken by my col­leagues, past and present, it never fails to re­in­force the im­por­tance of doc­u­ment­ing the present, so we can leave a piece of vis­ual his­tory for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions,” says Ms Yeow, who is ST’s pic­ture desk ed­i­tor.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong Hong Suen, NHB’s se­nior deputy di­rec­tor, cu­ra­to­rial and en­gage­ment, is heart­ened by the re­sponse to the ex­hi­bi­tion – where par­ents and grand­par­ents have been spot­ted ex­chang­ing lively con­ver­sa­tions with their chil­dren and grand­chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Cou­ples and groups of friends, too, have en­gaged in an­i­mated dis­cus­sions while view­ing the arte­facts and pho­tos.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong says: “Tech­nol­ogy has been a great en­abler for us to im­prove the vis­i­tor ex­pe­ri­ence and en­gage vis­i­tors on dif­fer­ent lev­els.”</p>
    <p>Mr James Chia and his wife Bar­bara, who are in their 40s, were there with their two daugh­ters aged nine and 11.</p>
    <p>Mr Chia, the chief ex­ec­u­tive of Ar­cLab, an ed­u­ca­tion tech­nol­ogy start-up, was drawn to the nos­tal­gia of the school tuck­shop cor­ner and another sec­tion which fea­tured the Kal­lang Roar, which he says united a gen­er­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>“But our story is still un­fin­ished,” he adds. “We still have much to do, like be more tol­er­ant of di­verse views and more aware of the un­sung heroes among us – as seen in the pho­tos show­ing our Covid-19 heroes and mi­grant work­ers.”</p>
    <p>For Ms Ju­lia Seah, a stu­dent at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s School of Art, De­sign and Me­dia, the mean­ing of home changed for her af­ter be­ing in­volved in the mu­seum’s Stu­dent Archivist pro­gramme, which col­lab­o­rated with her school for the ex­hi­bi­tion ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>“The ex­hi­bi­tion def­i­nitely got me think­ing about what home means to me,” says the 24-yearold, who adds that in the past, home was “wher­ever my fam­ily is”.</p>
    <p>“Fond­ness of a place grows over time with the ac­cu­mu­la­tion of shared ex­pe­ri­ences with fam­ily and friends,” she says.</p>
    <p>“Home is where we feel safe, se­cure and happy, and I am proud to call Sin­ga­pore my home.”</p>
