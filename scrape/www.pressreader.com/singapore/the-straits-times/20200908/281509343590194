    <p>“You will be sur­prized at dirts!” reads the text of Sexts From The Uni­verse, part of Mary­lyn Tan’s de­but po­etry col­lec­tion Gaze Back.</p>
    <p>What sur­prised Tan, 27, was how far the dirt would get her.</p>
    <p>On Aug 27, she made his­tory as the first woman to win the Sin­ga­pore Lit­er­a­ture Prize for English po­etry.</p>
    <p>“I’m happy that I won,” she says. “But I feel like I shouldn’t have been the first. I’m sure there is no dearth of good fe­male po­etry in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>The bi­en­nial prize, which was an­nounced in a vir­tual cer­e­mony, is Sin­ga­pore’s old­est on­go­ing lit­er­ary award in all four of­fi­cial lan­guages.</p>
    <p>Though its in­au­gu­ral winner in 1992 was a woman – Suchen Christine Lim for her novel Fist­ful Of Colours – it has never been awarded solely to a fe­male poet un­til now.</p>
    <p>Harti­nah Ah­mad won the prize for Malay po­etry in 2016 for an­thol­ogy Taf­siran Tiga Alam, which she co-au­thored with Hamed Is­mail and Sam­sudin Said. In 2014, Kr­ish­na­murthi Mathangi re­ceived a com­men­da­tion for Tamil po­etry for her col­lec­tion Malai­galin Parathal.</p>
    <p>Ac­cu­sa­tions of gen­der bias boiled over in 2014, when poet Grace Chia claimed the prize side­lined women’s writ­ing in a Face­book post. She and an­other fe­male poet, Ta­nia De Rozario, had been short­listed in the English po­etry cat­e­gory, which was jointly won by two male poets, Joshua Ip and Yong Shu Hoong.</p>
    <p>Chia’s post sparked back­lash on­line, even af­ter she with­drew it.</p>
    <p>Prom­i­nent fe­male poet Leong Liew Geok, one of the judges that year, de­fended their choice, say­ing they were look­ing not at gen­der but po­etic ex­cel­lence.</p>
    <p>Tan had not ex­pected to win this round ei­ther, even though Gaze Back had pre­vi­ously been short­listed for the Lambda Lit­er­ary Awards, a notable United States­based prize for les­bian, gay, bi­sex­ual and trans­gen­der works.</p>
    <p>One of the youngest short­listed for the Sin­ga­pore Lit­er­a­ture Prize this year, she beat four male poets, in­clud­ing Cul­tural Medal­lion re­cip­i­ent Ed­win Thum­boo and two-time winner Yong, for­merly her men­tor in the Cre­ative Arts Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Tan stud­ied lin­guis­tics at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity and now works as a con­tract cur­ricu­lum writer.</p>
    <p>Be­fore pub­lish­ing Gaze Back, she cut her teeth on the lo­cal spo­ken word scene.</p>
    <p>Last year, she worked with artist Za­rina Muham­mad on Apotropaic Texts, a mixed-me­dia in­stal­la­tion about pro­tec­tive magic in TheatreWor­ks’ women-cen­tric show­case Not Or­di­nary Work.</p>
    <p>“Gaze Back is es­sen­tially anti­estab­lish­ment,” she says. “It’s rail­ing against in­sti­tuted ways of power and priv­i­lege. So the fact that they chose it over some­thing else more tra­di­tional speaks vol­umes.”</p>
    <p>In their com­ments, the English po­etry judges – led by for­mer Sin­ga­pore Writ­ers Fes­ti­val di­rec­tor Yeow Kai Chai – said of Gaze Back: “It is not afraid to dis­ap­point our ex­pec­ta­tions of what a good and well-be­haved poem should do, in the ser­vice of truth-telling. It dis­turbs as it de­lights. It re­minds us of ev­ery­thing we are so afraid of putting into words.”</p>
    <p>The po­ems of Gaze Back revel in their de­viance. In her open­ing salvo, Tan sub­verts the rit­ual of “nasi kang kang”, a spell that in­volves men­stru­at­ing into steamed rice and feed­ing it to the per­son you want to con­trol. She writes: “for­get those who/ call you de­mon for you are/ self-pos­sessed – ”</p>
    <p>Tan’s publisher Ethos Books, which was be­hind four out of five ti­tles on the short­list, said in a state­ment: “There has been noth­ing like Gaze Back in the Sin­ga­pore lit­er­ary scene that presents the fe­male body in all its weird, grotesque and em­pow­ered forms.”</p>
    <p>It added: “While it’s worth cel­e­brat­ing this land­mark, that it is a land­mark at this point in time is also a stark re­minder that there is still so much work to be done in terms of sup­port­ing and giv­ing space to his­tor­i­cally un­der-rep­re­sented voices in our lo­cal lit­er­ary ecosys­tem.”</p>
    <p>Tan says: “There’s this cliche that good art is sup­posed to com­fort the un­com­fort­able and dis­com­fit the com­fort­able.</p>
    <p>“When you have a marginalis­ed ex­pe­ri­ence or you live in a body that is op­pressed, it is un­com­fort­able ev­ery sin­gle minute of ev­ery sin­gle day. And for some­body to be able to have a glimpse into that dis­com­fort, it’s a gift. It’s some­thing that shouldn’t be taken lightly.</p>
    <p>“It’s also a call to re­alise that there are peo­ple out­side your bub­ble who would very much trea­sure the things you take for granted – for ex­am­ple, just be­ing com­fort­able with the way your body looks in the morn­ing.”</p>
    <p>She does not yet know what she will do with her cash prize of $3,000. “I think I’ll take my par­ents out for a meal,” she says.</p>
    <p>When Gaze Back was first pub­lished, her par­ents, who work in fi­nance and ac­count­ing, were not en­thused. “They said, ‘Can you write some­thing more pleas­ant that would sell more copies, rather than some­thing so dis­gust­ing?’ They’ve al­ways wanted me to be a pleas­ant girl, but alas.”</p>
    <p>They have since been sup­port­ive of her win, adds Tan, who has a younger sis­ter. “They’re very proud of me.”</p>
    <p>She is al­ready feel­ing the pres­sure of be­ing a pi­o­neer at the age of 27. “How am I go­ing to top this?” she quips. “I’m go­ing to re­tire.”</p>
    <p>More se­ri­ously, she adds, she has be­gun writ­ing again af­ter two dry years. She wants to cre­ate mul­tidis­ci­plinary work – in the per­form­ing arts, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>She has started an ex­per­i­men­tal arts col­lec­tive, Dis­con­tent, which she hopes will have its first event next Fe­bru­ary, pend­ing the lift­ing of Covid-19 re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Her win has left her hope­ful.</p>
    <p>“I’m not say­ing we’ve bro­ken the mould and it’s a step for­ward for all strange fe­male poets in Sin­ga­pore from now on.</p>
    <p>“But it does feel like there is a space for our nar­ra­tives, even in very es­tab­lished, in­sti­tu­tion­alised forms of recog­ni­tion. It’s been a long time com­ing, but it is here.”</p>
