    <p>For­eign trav­ellers who have re­cently vis­ited South Africa will be barred from en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore from mid­night ow­ing to the risk of spread­ing a new coro­n­avirus strain.</p>
    <p>Long-term pass hold­ers and short-term vis­i­tors who have been there in the past 14 days will not be al­lowed to enter or tran­sit through the Repub­lic.</p>
    <p>The mea­sure, which starts from 11.59pm to­day, fol­lows news of a po­ten­tially more con­ta­gious strain cir­cu­lat­ing in South Africa.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to var­i­ous re­ports, the strain has made it over­seas to coun­tries such as Fin­land, Ja­pan and Switzer­land.</p>
    <p>“To re­duce the risk of spread to Sin­ga­pore, we are putting in place new bor­der re­stric­tions for trav­ellers from South Africa for fur­ther pre­cau­tion,” said the Min­istry of Health. It added that the re­stric­tion would also ap­ply to those who had ob­tained prior ap­proval to enter Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents re­turn­ing from South Africa are al­lowed en­try on con­di­tion that they are tested on ar­rival, and again to­wards the end of their 14-day stay-home no­tice (SHN).</p>
    <p>The mea­sure fol­lows Sin­ga­pore’s de­ci­sion to tighten re­stric­tions on trav­ellers com­ing from Bri­tain be­cause of the strain de­tected there.</p>
    <p>Since 11.59pm on Dec 23, all long-term pass hold­ers and short­term vis­i­tors who had trav­elled to Bri­tain within the last 14 days have not been al­lowed to enter or tran­sit through Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore re­ported its first case of the new strain from Bri­tain on the same day re­stric­tions were in­tro­duced. The pa­tient was a 17-year-old girl who had been study­ing in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>The ban also ap­plies to all those who had ob­tained prior ap­proval for en­try into Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>At the time, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said of the new coro­n­avirus vari­ant in Bri­tain: “We are con­cerned about the new strain.</p>
    <p>“The pre­lim­i­nary as­sess­ment is that it is 70 per cent more in­fec­tious, which is sig­nif­i­cant, and there­fore we think it is pru­dent to stop all in­com­ing trav­ellers from the UK dur­ing this pe­riod un­til we are able to learn more about this new strain of the virus.” Trav­ellers from South Africa were pre­vi­ously re­quired to serve a 14-day SHN.</p>
    <p>From to­mor­row, Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens and per­ma­nent res­i­dents re­turn­ing from South Africa will also need to take a Covid-19 poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) test on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore at the start of their SHN.</p>
    <p>These test re­quire­ments do not ap­ply to those only tran­sit­ing through Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>To ex­pe­dite their Covid-19 PCR test at the air­port, trav­ellers are en­cour­aged to reg­is­ter and pre-pay for their ar­rival test be­fore de­part­ing for Sin­ga­pore, added the Health Min­istry.</p>
    <p>It said: “While the strain has been sug­gested to be more trans­mis­si­ble, there is cur­rently in­suf­fi­cient ev­i­dence to de­ter­mine if this strain is as­so­ci­ated with any change in dis­ease sever­ity, an­ti­body re­sponse or vac­cine ef­fi­cacy. These as­pects are be­ing in­ves­ti­gated.”</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with the Wall Street Jour­nal pub­lished last Wed­nes­day, prin­ci­pal med­i­cal sci­en­tist Ji­nal Bhi­man of the Na­tional In­sti­tute for Com­mu­ni­ca­ble Dis­eases in Jo­han­nes­burg said that the vari­ant is un­likely to be play­ing a large role in South Africa’s coro­n­avirus spike. In­stead, it seems likely that it is part of a “per­fect storm”, in which the emer­gence of the vari­ant has co­in­cided with the coun­try’s main sum­mer hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>While the de­gree of dan­ger re­mains un­cer­tain, Sin­ga­pore is tak­ing no chances.</p>
    <p>The re­stric­tions will be in place un­til fur­ther no­tice, said the Min­istry of Health.</p>
