        <p>Twelve months af­ter los­ing their SEA Games crown in the Philip­pines, the Sin­ga­pore men’s wa­ter polo team will be part­ing ways with their coach of four years De­jan Mi­lakovic.</p>
        <p>The Serb will be re­placed by former Ja­pan na­tional cap­tain Kan Aoyogi, who will take over in March. This comes shortly af­ter the Sin­ga­pore Swim­ming As­so­ci­a­tion (SSA) ap­pointed Aus­tralian Paul Ober­man as its wa­ter polo tech­ni­cal di­rec­tor this month.</p>
        <p>The de­vel­op­ments fol­low a com­pre­hen­sive re­view con­ducted af­ter their SEA Games loss in De­cem­ber 2019, when the men’s team saw their 27-gold streak come to an end. With its new coach, the as­so­ci­a­tion is also mov­ing to adopt a Ja­panese phi­los­o­phy, af­ter a fouryear ex­per­i­ment with an Euro­pean coach saw lim­ited suc­cess.</p>
        <p>Do­minic Soh, SSA’s vice-pres­i­dent for wa­ter polo, said: “Kan’s knowl­edge and ex­per­tise in coach­ing Asian-physique play­ers will be ben­e­fi­cial in im­prov­ing the tech­nique and the style of play for our play­ers.</p>
        <p>“More­over, his fa­mil­iar­ity with the sys­tem in Ja­pan where the play­ers are also not pro­fes­sion­als and have to bal­ance school and work with train­ing will al­low him to plan train­ing sched­ules that will ben­e­fit the play­ers and still get the best out of them.”</p>
        <p>The 40-year-old was the pos­si­ble. youngest player to be called up to the Ja­panese na­tional team in 1998 and he won a sil­ver medal at the 2002 and 2006 Asian Games, be­fore skip­per­ing the team to a bronze at the 2010 edi­tion.</p>
        <p>He is cur­rently the gen­eral man­ager and head coach of the Bour­bon Wa­ter Polo Club Kashi­wazaki, where he won the Ja­panese league ti­tle in 2012 and 2018 as a player. He had also played pro­fes­sion­ally from 1999 to 2009 in Mon­tene­gro, Spain and Italy.</p>
        <p>Af­ter his re­tire­ment, he was head coach of the Ni­igata Sangyo Univer­sity Wa­ter Polo Club’s men’s and women’s teams from 2010 to 2017.</p>
        <p>SSA is look­ing to Aoyogi to im­ple­ment the counter-at­tack­ing wa­ter polo that it feels is a tac­tic used suc­cess­fully by the Ja­panese, in or­der to make up for Sin­ga­pore’s lack of large and pow­er­ful cen­tre for­wards. Re­claim­ing gold at the next SEA Games and an Asian Games</p>
        <p>podium fin­ish by 2030 are also key pri­or­i­ties.</p>
        <p>Aoyogi told The Straits Times: “To do so, I will work on get­ting the team to have a good un­der­stand­ing of the the­ory, and build­ing up their foot­work.”</p>
        <p>Not­ing that the Sin­ga­pore team are cur­rently out­side the podium places at the Asian Games, he added that it is pos­si­ble to win a bronze “by strength­en­ing our train­ing”.</p>
        <p>He said: “To win gold, in ad­di­tion to phys­i­cal train­ing, other fac­tors such as im­prov­ing the train­ing environmen­t is re­quired. Strength­en­ing a team is like grow­ing fruit and it takes a few years for any fruit to grow from a seed to be eaten. It takes four to five years to win a medal, and a sim­i­lar pe­riod to win gold... but it is pos­si­ble.”</p>
        <p>SSA’s post-mortem last year had iden­ti­fied four key ar­eas of im­prove­ment – a lim­ited pool of play­ers for the na­tional squad, men­tal re­silience in com­pe­ti­tion, lead­er­ship in the pool, and the team’s is­sues with Mi­lakovic.</p>
        <p>The team had re­port­edly lost some se­nior play­ers as a re­sult of Mi­lakovic’s train­ing style and there had also been some as­sim­i­la­tion is­sues be­tween both par­ties.</p>
        <p>Un­der the Serb’s charge, the na­tional men’s team had seen their re­sults slip as they dropped from fifth to sixth at the 2018 Asian Games. While they won the Fina Wa­ter Polo Chal­lengers Cup in 2019, the team also re­turned home from the Philip­pines SEA Games with only a bronze.</p>
        <p>Mi­lakovic, who had been cred</p>
        <p>ited with in­still­ing dis­ci­pline in the team and the es­tab­lish­ment of the na­tional youth de­vel­op­ment squad, had only kind words for his former em­ployer and team.</p>
        <p>He said: “It was an ex­cit­ing four years where we tried to be the best we can in every pos­si­ble way. It was a chance for play­ers to learn some new things about wa­ter polo but also for me to learn from them.</p>
        <p>“There were some chal­lenges at the be­gin­ning but over time, we found a way to work best to­gether and en­joy every day at the pool.”</p>
        <p>Point­ing to the team’s crop of young play­ers in 2018, Mi­lakovic added that he wishes SSA and Sin­ga­pore wa­ter polo the “best of luck and many vic­to­ries in the fu­ture”.</p>
        <p>While na­tional cap­tain Lee Kai Yang is sad to see Mi­lakovic go, he is also look­ing for­ward to im­prov­ing un­der Aoyogi.</p>
        <p>He said: “Coach De­jan has been in­stru­men­tal in many ar­eas of im­prove­ment in the team and he has been an ex­am­ple of con­stant striv­ing for per­fec­tion. The team sup­port the man­age­ment’s de­ci­sion in the change of coach and will strive to col­lab­o­rate well in mak­ing this tran­si­tion to­gether.”</p>
        <p>As Sin­ga­pore wa­ter polo links up with their first Ja­panese coach, Lee said it would be an op­por­tu­nity to learn and adopt greater va­ri­ety in their game play.</p>
        <p>“With the coach and team putting com­mit­ment, pro­fes­sion­al­ism and will­ing­ness to ex­pand our knowl­edge to­gether, we hope to grow much stronger,” he added.</p>
        <p>Strength­en­ing a team is like grow­ing fruit and it takes a few years for any fruit to grow from a seed to be eaten. It takes four to five years to win a medal, and a sim­i­lar pe­riod to win gold... but it is</p>
