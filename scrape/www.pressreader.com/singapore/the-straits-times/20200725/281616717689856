    <p>A for­mer deputy group di­rec­tor of the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) was yes­ter­day charged with cor­rup­tion in­volv­ing $1.24 mil­lion in loans from con­trac­tors and sub­con­trac­tors.</p>
    <p>Henry Foo Yung Thye, 46, who had a gam­bling habit and had chalked up debts, al­legedly ob­tained grat­i­fi­ca­tion in the form of loans from con­trac­tors and sub­con­trac­tors of the LTA be­tween 2014 and last year.</p>
    <p>Some time early last year, the Sin­ga­porean also al­legedly at­tempted to ob­tain grat­i­fi­ca­tion in the form of a loan of around $30,000 from a sub-con­trac­tor of the LTA in or­der to ad­vance its busi­ness in­ter­est with the agency.</p>
    <p>Foo also al­legedly cheated his col­leagues at the LTA into ex­tend­ing him loans to­talling about $726,500 be­tween 2008 and last year, by dis­hon­estly con­ceal­ing from them that the loans were in­tended to ser­vice his gam­bling habit and debts.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, he faces 36 charges. His bail has been set at $250,000.</p>
    <p>Six in­di­vid­u­als and a com­pany which pro­vided Foo with the loans to ad­vance their busi­ness in­ter­ests were also charged yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The in­di­vid­u­als are: Chi­nese na­tional Cai Jun­gang, 56, di­rec­tor of Tritech Engi­neer­ing & Test­ing (Sin­ga­pore); Sin­ga­porean Zhang Xihu, 52, di­rec­tor of MEPT Engi­neer­ing; Sin­ga­porean Pay Teow Heng, 52, di­rec­tor of Tiong Seng Con­trac­tors; Sin­ga­porean Pek Lian Guan, 55, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Tiong Seng Con­trac­tors; South Korean na­tional Ro Sung-young, 48, project man­ager of Dae­woo Engi­neer­ing & Con­struc­tion; and South Korean na­tional Kim Young-gyu, 51, project di­rec­tor of Dae­woo Engi­neer­ing & Con­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>They were each of­fered bail, with the low­est set at $25,000 for Kim and the high­est at $200,000 each for Pek and Pay.</p>
    <p>China Rail­way Tun­nel Group’s Sin­ga­pore branch (CRTG) was also charged with three counts of cor­ruptly giv­ing grat­i­fi­ca­tion in the form of loans of about $220,000 to Foo as an in­duce­ment to ad­vance the com­pany’s busi­ness in­ter­est with the LTA.</p>
    <p>An­other per­son was also charged over of­fences in­volv­ing the pay­ments from CRTG. Sin­ga­porean Chen Xuguang, 53, was di­rec­tor of Tong Sheng Con­struc­tion & Trad­ing when he al­legedly abet­ted the fal­si­fi­ca­tion of Tong Sheng in­voices as a sub-con­trac­tor of CRTG. He was of­fered bail of $10,000.</p>
    <p>The board of Tiong Seng Hold­ings said in a Sin­ga­pore Ex­change an­nounce­ment yes­ter­day that both Pek and Pay will re­lin­quish their cur­rent ex­ec­u­tive roles in the com­pany from July 31.</p>
    <p>Pek will re­main as ad­viser to the group, while Pay will be op­er­a­tional con­sul­tant to Tiong Seng Civil Engi­neer­ing for a year. The board also said it will re-as­sess this ar­range­ment “where ap­pro­pri­ate in due course”.</p>
    <p>Any­one who is con­victed of a cor­rup­tion of­fence can be fined up to $100,000 or jailed for up to five years, or both. If the of­fence is re­lated to a mat­ter or con­tract with the Gov­ern­ment or a pub­lic body, the max­i­mum jail term for each of­fence can be in­creased to seven years in jail. Those who are con­victed of cheat­ing or the fal­si­fi­ca­tion of ac­counts can be fined and jailed for up to 10 years.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to me­dia queries, LTA said Foo is a for­mer em­ployee, but did not say when he left.</p>
    <p>“As the case is now be­fore court, we are un­able to com­ment on the mat­ter,” a spokesman added.</p>
    <p>Foo was awarded the Pub­lic Ad­min­is­tra­tion Medal (Bronze) in 2013, when he was di­rec­tor of the Thom­son-East Coast MRT line.</p>
