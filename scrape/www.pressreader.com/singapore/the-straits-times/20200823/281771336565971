    <p>MOSCOW • Poi­son has been a favoured tool of Rus­sian in­tel­li­gence agen­cies for more than a cen­tury. And crit­ics of the Krem­lin and in­de­pen­dent an­a­lysts say the weapon re­mains in use to­day.</p>
    <p>While coun­tries, in­clud­ing the United States and Is­rael, have tar­geted killing pro­grammes, they are strictly lim­ited to coun­tert­er­ror­ism ef­forts. Rus­sia, by con­trast, has been ac­cused of tar­get­ing a wide va­ri­ety of op­po­nents both at home and abroad.</p>
    <p>The Soviet Union op­er­ated a se­cret lab­o­ra­tory to re­search taste­less, un­trace­able poi­sons that were tested on con­demned pris­on­ers, de­fec­tors have said.</p>
    <p>After a series of as­sas­si­na­tions of dis­si­dents, jour­nal­ists, de­fec­tors and op­po­si­tion lead­ers in Rus­sia and abroad over the past two decades, re­searchers have con­cluded that the post-Soviet gov­ern­ment has turned to its poi­son arse­nal as a pre­ferred weapon.</p>
    <p>Sub­stances iden­ti­fied or sus­pected in poi­son­ings blamed on the Rus­sian gov­ern­ment in­clude ra­dioac­tive polo­nium-210; heavy met­als; gelsemium, a rare Hi­malayan plant toxin; and Novichuk, a mil­i­tary nerve agent lethal to the touch.</p>
    <p>Lac­ing a meal or cup of tea with poi­son is sim­ple and re­quires no spe­cial train­ing, one-time KGB colonel and former op­po­si­tion par­lia­men­tar­ian Gen­nadi Gud­kov said.</p>
    <p>“It is easy, and easy to cover your tracks. Any per­son can use poi­son,” he said, adding that poi­sons can be in­tended ei­ther to kill or to in­ca­pac­i­tate a per­son with a long, un­pleas­ant ill­ness.</p>
    <p>Dr Yaroslav Ashikhmin, the per­sonal doc­tor of Rus­sian op­po­si­tion politi­cian Alexei Navalny – who is now in coma fol­low­ing a sud­den ill­ness shortly after drink­ing a cup of tea at an air­port cafe last week – said he had not seen Mr Navalny since the ill­ness be­gan, so he could not say if poi­son was the cause.</p>
    <p>But he added: “It looks like it.”</p>
