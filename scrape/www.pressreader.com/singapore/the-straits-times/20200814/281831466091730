    <p>NEW YORK • Nearly nine out of 10 Democrats ap­prove of US Sen­a­tor Ka­mala Har­ris as their party’s vi­cepres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee, and she is more pop­u­lar than pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den among women, young vot­ers and some Repub­li­cans, a Reuters/Ip­sos poll shows.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic opin­ion poll, taken on Tues­day and Wed­nes­day, also found that 60 per cent of Amer­i­cans, i nclud­ing 87 per cent of Democrats and 37 per cent of Repub­li­cans, con­sid­ered the se­lec­tion of</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris – the first black wo­man and Asian Amer­i­can nom­i­nated for the vice-pres­i­dency – to be a “ma­jor mile­stone” for the United States.</p>
    <p>The sen­a­tor from Cal­i­for­nia is viewed about as favourably or bet­ter than Mr Bi­den in most ma­jor de­mo­graphic groups, the poll showed, high­light­ing her po­ten­tial to help the for­mer vice-pres­i­dent ex­pand his sup­port in Novem­ber’s elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris, 55, is the daugh­ter of Ja­maican and In­dian im­mi­grants and made her own bid for the White House. She was a for­mer pros­e­cu­tor and state at­tor­ney-gen­eral in Cal­i­for­nia, and be­came only the sec­ond black fe­male US sen­a­tor in his­tory when elected in 2016.</p>
    <p>The poll also showed Mr Bi­den’s lead over Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump was ef­fec­tively un­changed after he an­nounced his run­ning mate choice, ris­ing by 1 per­cent­age point among all Amer­i­cans to an 8-point ad­van­tage – well within the poll’s cred­i­bil­ity in­ter­val</p>
    <p>– against a sim­i­lar poll that ran on Mon­day and Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Forty-six per cent of US adults said they would vote for a Bi­den/Har­ris ticket, while 38 per cent would vote for Mr Trump and Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence.</p>
    <p>The lat­est poll also found that 56 per cent of Amer­i­cans have a favourable im­pres­sion of Ms Har­ris, which is about the same as the num­ber who favour Mr Bi­den. Forty-two per cent of US adults say they have a favourable view of Mr</p>
    <p>Trump and 47 per cent said the same of Mr Pence.</p>
    <p>Among women, 60 per cent said they have a favourable view of Ms Har­ris, against 53 per cent who felt the same way about Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, about 25 per cent of Repub­li­cans said they had a favourable view of Ms Har­ris and ap­prove of her choice as Mr Bi­den’s run­ning mate. Only about 20 per cent of Repub­li­cans said they have a sim­i­larly favourable view of Mr Bi­den.</p>
