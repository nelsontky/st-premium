    <p>NEW YORK Do­minic Thiem says he ded­i­cated his whole life to win­ning a Grand Slam ti­tle and with his vic­tory at the US Open on Sun­day, he ex­pects more of the sport’s big­gest prizes to come his way.</p>
    <p>The Aus­trian had lost his three pre­vi­ous Ma­jor finals and looked as if he had squan­dered an­other chance when Alexan­der Zverev won the first two sets in New York.</p>
    <p>But he staged a stun­ning come­back to win 2-6, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 (8-6) in a nerve-jan­gling bat­tle of wills and will now head to the French Open with re­newed confidence.</p>
    <p>“I ex­pect it’s go­ing to be eas­ier for me now in the big­gest tour­na­ments,” said Thiem, who be­came the first player out­side Rafael Nadal, No­vak Djokovic and Roger Fed­erer to claim a Grand Slam ti­tle since Stan Wawrinka’s 2016 US Open tri­umph.</p>
    <p>“I had it in the back of my head that I had a great ca­reer so far, way bet­ter than I could ever dream of, but un­til to­day there was still a big goal miss­ing.</p>
    <p>“With this achieved, I hope that I’m go­ing to be a lit­tle bit more re­laxed and play a lit­tle bit more freely at the big­gest events.”</p>
    <p>Thiem said his tri­umph – the first time in the tour­na­ment’s Open Era his­tory that a player had re­cov­ered from los­ing the open­ing two sets to win the ti­tle – was a cul­mi­na­tion of years of hard work and sac­ri­fice.</p>
    <p>“Def­i­nitely achieved a life goal, a dream, which I had for many, many years. Back then it was so far away. Then I got closer to the top and re­alised that maybe one day I could re­ally win one of the four big­gest ti­tles,” he added.</p>
    <p>“I ded­i­cated ba­si­cally my whole life un­til this point to win one. Now I did it. That’s for my­self, my team and fam­ily, a great ac­com­plish­ment.”</p>
    <p>Thiem came into the US Open fi­nal hav­ing lost in five sets to Djokovic in the fi­nal of the Aus­tralian Open ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>He also lost in the fi­nal of the French Open in 2018 and 2019, both times to Nadal.</p>
    <p>Thiem said the near misses were a chain around his neck dur­ing Sun­day’s show­down on Arthur Ashe as he was over­come with nerves in the first two sets.</p>
    <p>“Hon­estly, I think it didn’t help me at all be­cause I was so tight in the be­gin­ning,” he said. “I mean, I wanted this ti­tle so much, and of course it was also in my head that if I lose this one, it’s 0-4.</p>
    <p>“It’s al­ways in your head. Is this chance ever com­ing back again? All these thoughts, which are not great to play your best tennis, to play free.”</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old starts his bid for his sec­ond Slam next week at the French Open where he will seek re­venge for those two de­feats by Nadal. He be­lieves that he would be fit for Roland Gar­ros after the re­al­i­sa­tion he is a Grand Slam cham­pion sinks in.</p>
    <p>“Phys­i­cally I’m go­ing to be fine, 100 per cent. I’m go­ing to have enough time to re­cover from all the trou­bles I had,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But the ques­tion is how I’m go­ing to do it with the emo­tions men­tally. Ob­vi­ously, I’ve never been in this sit­u­a­tion. I achieved a big, big goal. I don’t know how I’m go­ing to feel the next days.”</p>
    <p>Zverev pledged to bounce back from his bit­terly dis­ap­point­ing loss and cap­ture a Grand Slam one day.</p>
    <p>“For me what up­set me the most is not the third set, it’s the fifth set,” the Ger­man said. “I had a lot of chances in the fifth set and didn’t use them. Ob­vi­ously be­ing two sets to love and a break up in a Grand Slam fi­nal then los­ing is not easy.”</p>
    <p>He added that the raw­ness of the de­feat meant it was too soon to say whether he had taken any pos­i­tives. “That ques­tion is prob­a­bly two, three days too early to ask right now,” he said. “I’m 23 years old. I don’t think it’s my last chance. I do be­lieve that I will be a Grand Slam cham­pion at some point.”</p>
