    <p>Food and bev­er­age (F&B) out­lets and din­ers who breach safe man­age­ment mea­sures will now be pe­nalised even for the first of­fence in­stead of just re­ceiv­ing a warn­ing, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This move will kick in with im­me­di­ate ef­fect, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said in a state­ment, given that there has been suf­fi­cient time for F&B out­lets and their cus­tomers to ad­just to the rules.</p>
    <p>An MOH spokesman added that the min­istry re­mains “very con­cerned” about such breaches.</p>
    <p>“Din­ing out is an ac­tiv­ity that in­volves con­sid­er­able risks be­cause peo­ple are gath­ered to­gether in an en­closed space, with­out their masks on, and for a pro­longed du­ra­tion,” he said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Since the start of phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing on June 19, around 20 F&B es­tab­lish­ments have been sus­pended, added MOH.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at a multi-min­istry task force press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, Mr Wong said en­force­ment agen­cies will also step up spot checks and en­force­ment ac­tion. “Most peo­ple are com­ply­ing with these mea­sures, but there are still a few breaches that we pick up on a daily ba­sis, and they typ­i­cally hap­pen at the pop­u­lar nightspots,” he said.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, there are peo­ple who drink af­ter 10.30pm and at­tempt to dis­guise their al­co­hol, who do not wear masks, or who gather in groups of more than five.</p>
    <p>“The op­er­a­tors who are do­ing this are caus­ing un­nec­es­sary risk to their din­ers and I think it’s also not fair for the ma­jor­ity of op­er­a­tors who are com­ply­ing with the rules, and yet these few are tak­ing their chances and breach­ing the rules,” added Mr Wong, who co-chairs the task force.</p>
    <p>Es­tab­lish­ments that breach the rules will be fined or made to close, de­pend­ing on the sever­ity of the of­fence. For in­stance, if mul­ti­ple breaches of safe man­age­ment mea­sures are found in any one place, the au­thor­i­ties will re­quire the premises to close and will also sur­face the case to the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers for pos­si­ble pros­e­cu­tion, MOH said.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said that while the au­thor­i­ties un­der­stand some fa­tigue has crept in over Covid-19 rules, it is im­por­tant to com­ply with the ex­ist­ing mea­sures as this will de­ter­mine whether Sin­ga­pore can con­tinue to pro­gres­sively re­sume ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“If we are not even able to keep to the ex­ist­ing mea­sures, then why even talk about fur­ther lib­er­al­i­sa­tions or eas­ing, which will cause more prob­lems down the road? So we re­ally seek ev­ery­one’s co­op­er­a­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Author­ity (URA) said seven F&B out­lets in pop­u­lar nightspots were fined $1,000 each for fail­ing to com­ply with safe dis­tanc­ing rules over the past week­end.</p>
    <p>Two bars out of these seven that were fined – Le Noir and Coy­ote Ugly in Clarke Quay – will also be sus­pended from to­day to Sept 19, while fines will also be is­sued to 17 in­di­vid­u­als found breach­ing the five-per­son rule at var­i­ous other F&B out­lets, the URA added. More in­di­vid­u­als are un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Com­mon ex­am­ples of breaches that were found at the seven out­lets last Fri­day to Sun­day in­clude hav­ing more than five peo­ple in a group, and fail­ing to en­sure a min­i­mum dis­tance of 1m be­tween groups. Cus­tomers across groups were seen in­ter­min­gling and some op­er­a­tors were also found to have know­ingly ac­cepted reser­va­tions for more than five peo­ple, said the URA.</p>
    <p>The out­lets that were fined are lo­cated in Boat Quay, Clarke Quay, China Square and Tan­jong Pa­gar.</p>
