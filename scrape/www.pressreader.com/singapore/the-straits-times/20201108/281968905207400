    <p>Wear­ing a mask daily has be­come rou­tine dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and this prac­tice is ex­pected to con­tinue un­der the “new nor­mal”.</p>
    <p>But par­ents and ex­perts have raised con­cerns over the l ongterm ef­fects of mask wear­ing for chil­dren.</p>
    <p>A 2016 study by Fron­tiers In Psy­chol­ogy – a peer-re­viewed, open-ac­cess aca­demic journal – showed that fa­cial ex­pres­sions and vis­ual cues are of great im­por­tance in that they al­low chil­dren to share and iden­tify emo­tions dur­ing so­cial in­ter­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Wear­ing a mask could lead to de­vel­op­men­tal de­lays in com­mu­ni­ca­tion mat­ters just as chil­dren are learn­ing to ex­press them­selves, said Ms Aarti Mun­dae, di­rec­tor of In­con­tact Coun­selling and Train­ing.</p>
    <p>She said: “Com­mu­ni­ca­tion is deeply in­flu­enced by vis­ual cues. It is only 38 per cent af­fected by vo­cal cues and, sur­pris­ingly, 7 per cent by ver­bal. This makes the need to ex­press and see fa­cial cues sig­nif­i­cant.”</p>
    <p>Ver­bal cues re­fer to words while vo­cal cues en­com­pass tone of voice, vol­ume and pitch.</p>
    <p>“It could also cause de­lays in their devel­op­ment of so­cial and emo­tional in­tel­li­gence as they are un­able to pick up the finer nu­ances that are crit­i­cal to their com­pre­hen­sion of feel­ings,” she added.</p>
    <p>But pre-schools are find­ing ways to work around this.</p>
    <p>MapleBear’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Pa­tri­cia Koh said that speech devel­op­ment is par­tic­u­larly cru­cial for those aged two to three years old.</p>
    <p>“Teach­ers will pay more at­ten­tion to those who are more quiet and who may need more help. For the es­pe­cially young ones, teach­ers will wear shields, in­stead of masks, to speak clearly so the chil­dren can see their lips,” she said, adding that this is a pri­or­ity while also main­tain­ing good hy­giene habits to keep the chil­dren safe.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng Yi Xian, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of EtonHouse In­ter­na­tional Ed­u­ca­tion Group, said that many emo­tional needs can go un­no­ticed when chil­dren have their masks on.</p>
    <p>Hence, teach­ers at EtonHouse pay ex­tra at­ten­tion to the non-ver­bal cues chil­dren give, in­clud­ing body lan­guage and ges­tures to con­vey a mes­sage or ex­press an emo­tion, he said.</p>
    <p>Masks can also make it harder to un­der­stand speech, es­pe­cially in the case of sim­i­lar-sound­ing words and sounds.</p>
    <p>“Masks also block vis­ual cues, in­clud­ing fa­cial ex­pres­sions and lip po­si­tions of the teach­ers that help chil­dren un­der­stand speech,” he added.</p>
    <p>Teach­ers now use face masks that have a trans­par­ent por­tion over their mouth area at times such as when they are read­ing a book.</p>
    <p>At PAP Com­mu­nity Foun­da­tion (PCF) Sparkle­tots cen­tres, teach­ers are trained to rely on au­di­tory feed­back – lis­ten­ing to the sounds made by the child – in­stead of vis­ual ob­ser­va­tion of the child’s mouth, when it comes to young chil­dren with un­clear speech.</p>
    <p>Par­ents of these chil­dren are en­cour­aged to pro­vide speech sam­ples recorded at home for fur­ther as­sess­ment, a process that is not im­peded due to mask wear­ing, said Dr Honey Ng, PCF Sparkle­tots’ deputy di­rec­tor of the in­clu­sive ed­u­ca­tion team.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, the le­gal min­i­mum age for chil­dren to wear masks in Sin­ga­pore was raised to six years old and above, up from two years old and above.</p>
    <p>The change came after t he World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion and United Na­tions In­ter­na­tional Chil­dren’s Emer­gency Fund is­sued an ad­vi­sory that chil­dren aged five and un­der should not be re­quired to wear masks.</p>
    <p>An in­ter­na­tional and mul­ti­dis­ci­plinary ex­pert group had re­viewed ev­i­dence on Covid-19 trans­mis­sion in chil­dren and the use of masks by chil­dren. It also con­sid­ered the chil­dren’s psy­cho-so­cial needs and de­vel­op­men­tal mile­stones when mak­ing the rec­om­men­da­tions.</p>
