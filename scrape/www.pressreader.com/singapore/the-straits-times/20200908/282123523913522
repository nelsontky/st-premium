    <p>The founders of Sin­ga­pore food or­der­ing app Od­dle, which of­fers choices from Miche­lin-starred restau­rants to bub­ble tea con­coc­tions, are work­ing with an ad­viser to exit the com­pany, ac­cord­ing to sources with knowl­edge of the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The start-up, co-founded by Mr Jonathan Lim, Mr Pua Yong Xiang and Mr Jeremy Lee, has reached out to po­ten­tial suit­ors to gauge in­ter­est, said the sources, ask­ing not to be named as the process is pri­vate.</p>
    <p>Sale doc­u­ments show that Od­dle has raised to­tal funds of $5 mil­lion over the past three years and is pro­ject­ing a gross profit of $8 mil­lion for fis­cal year end­ing March next year, the sources said.</p>
    <p>On­line food or­der­ing from peo­ple stuck in­doors has taken off since the out­break of Covid-19, boost­ing rev­enues at com­pa­nies such as Od­dle. De­lib­er­a­tions are at an early stage and the founders could de­cide to keep the busi­ness, the sources said. The com­pany de­clined to com­ment when con­tacted by Bloomberg News.</p>
    <p>Od­dle counts SPH Ven­tures, RB In­vest­ments, Fidelis Cap­i­tal, Wave­maker Part­ners and Quest Ven­tures among its back­ers, ac­cord­ing to its most re­cent fil­ings with Sin­ga­pore reg­u­la­tors. The com­pany’s or­der man­age­ment sys­tem is used by some 3,000 brands in more than 10 coun­tries, its web­site shows.</p>
    <p>Among these out­lets is Odette, ranked as Asia’s best restau­rant, where peo­ple can or­der Nor­mandy crab dumplings and milk-fed Ax­uria lamb.</p>
    <p>The start-up posted rev­enue of $1.8 mil­lion in the year ended March 31, 2018, up 57 per cent from a year ear­lier, ac­cord­ing to the fil­ings.</p>
    <p>Its net loss nar­rowed to $2.3 mil­lion from $2.6 mil­lion. Od­dle’s move comes as the num­ber of tech­nol­ogy start-up ex­its in South-east Asia was lit­tle changed in the first half of this year from a year ago, ac­cord­ing to a re­cent report by Sin­ga­pore-based Cento Ven­tures.</p>
    <p>The pro­ceeds gen­er­ated from the ex­its dropped by al­most 50 per cent, the report said.</p>
