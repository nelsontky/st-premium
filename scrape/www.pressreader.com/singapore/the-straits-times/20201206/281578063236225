    <p>SIN­GA­PORE TOURISM BOARD AND EN­TER­PRISE SIN­GA­PORE, in a joint state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Re­tailer Foot Locker has been or­dered to sus­pend op­er­a­tions for 10 days, from yes­ter­day to Dec 14, at its Or­chard Gate­way @ Emer­ald out­let for fail­ing to com­ply with Covid-19 safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“Large crowds had gath­ered at the out­let for a prod­uct launch on Fri­day, de­spite re­peated ad­vi­sories by pub­lic en­force­ment agen­cies on crowd man­age­ment,” the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) said in a joint state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the pe­riod of its sus­pen­sion, Foot Locker’s Or­chard out­let is not per­mit­ted to con­duct phys­i­cal re­tail ac­tiv­i­ties, but may con­tinue to carry out such ac­tiv­i­ties on­line.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions are still on­go­ing and fur­ther en­force­ment ac­tion may be taken, the agen­cies said.</p>
    <p>STB and ESG are also en­gag­ing Foot Locker on the mea­sures it wi l l take for fu­ture prod­uct launches, in­clud­ing the po­ten­tial ces­sa­tion of all such phys­i­cal ac­tiv­ity at its lo­ca­tions across Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>They added that re­tail busi­nesses are strongly ad­vised to hold on­line sales, in­stead of or­gan­is­ing phys­i­cal prod­uct launches that may at­tract large crowds.</p>
    <p>“If phys­i­cal launches are held, busi­nesses must en­sure they have ro­bust plans for safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place, in­clud­ing crowd man­age­ment and ca­pac­ity lim­its,” the agen­cies said.</p>

    <p>SAFETY MEA­SURES NEEDED</p>
    <p>Large crowds had gath­ered at the out­let for a prod­uct launch on Fri­day, de­spite re­peated ad­vi­sories by pub­lic en­force­ment agen­cies on crowd man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>If phys­i­cal launches are held, busi­nesses must en­sure they have ro­bust plans for safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place, in­clud­ing crowd man­age­ment and ca­pac­ity lim­its. lim­ited-edi­tion Adi­das sneak­ers, an item that can fetch a tidy profit on the sec­ondary mar­ket due to high de­mand.</p>
    <p>A Foot Locker spokesman told The Sun­day Times yes­ter­day: “We take the is­sues of crowd­ing se­ri­ously and are con­tin­u­ing to work dili­gently and proac­tively to main­tain safe dis­tanc­ing for all of our shop­pers and staff.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to en­force re­stric­tions on max­i­mum oc­cu­pancy for all of our stores ac­cord­ing to the guide­lines set forth by the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>When The Sun­day Times vis­ited the footwear store at around 10am yes­ter­day, there were no crowds. Se­cu­rity of­fi­cers were seen ad­vis­ing some peo­ple wait­ing out­side the store that the sneaker launch had been can­celled.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, photos cir­cu­lat­ing on so­cial me­dia at about 8pm showed a crowd of around 100 peo­ple packed shoul­der to shoul­der out­side the footwear store.</p>
    <p>The crowds dis­persed shortly af­ter 8.30pm when safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors and po­lice of­fi­cers ar­rived.</p>
    <p>Adi­das’ Yeezy sneaker line, the prod­uct of a col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween rap­per Kanye West and the sports shoe brand, has drawn large crowds in Sin­ga­pore and abroad dur­ing past launches.</p>
    <p>The newly re­leased Adi­das Yeezy Boost 350 V2 Men Orig­i­nals re­tails at $349 on the Adi­das Sin­ga­pore web­site, while its equiv­a­lent for chil­dren and in­fants goes for $250 and $220 re­spec­tively. All three prod­ucts are sold out on the web­site.</p>
    <p>Adi­das Sin­ga­pore had held an on­line bal­lot for the lim­ited re­lease, but many sneaker afi­ciona­dos who missed out ap­peared to have tried their luck at Foot Locker, given the high re­sale value of the shoes.</p>
    <p>Foot Locker Sin­ga­pore had ear­lier mar­keted it­self as the place to snag the ex­clu­sive shoes.</p>
    <p>“These train­ers are hot – the hype is real... Foot Locker is at the head of the lat­est trends, so you know it’ll stock Yeezy boost train­ers on­line and in se­lect stores,” it said on its web­site prior to the launch.</p>
    <p>The Foot Locker Sin­ga­pore web­site was down as of yes­ter­day af­ter­noon. It was also down on Fri­day even­ing.</p>
    <p>Last June, the launch of the lim­ited-edi­tion Adi­das Yeezy Boost 350 V2 in black drew a long queue that lasted for many hours ahead of its re­lease at Foot Locker’s Jewel Changi Air­port out­let.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act passed in Par­lia­ment in April, those found flout­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures face a fine of up to $10,000 and/or im­pris­on­ment of up to six months.</p>
    <p>Re­peat of­fend­ers can be fined up to $20,000 and/or jailed for up to one year.</p>
