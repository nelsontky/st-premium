    <p>Chang’e-5’s goal is to col­lect lu­nar rocks and soil to help sci­en­tists learn about the Moon’s ori­gins, for­ma­tion and vol­canic ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>If the re­turn jour­ney is suc­cess­ful, China will be only the third coun­try to have re­trieved sam­ples from the Moon, fol­low­ing the United States and the then Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
    <p>BEI­JING • A Chi­nese space probe yes­ter­day be­gan drilling on the sur­face of the Moon hours af­ter land­ing, in an am­bi­tious at­tempt to bring back the first lu­nar sam­ples in four decades.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has poured bil­lions of dol­lars into its mil­i­tary-run space pro­gramme, with hopes of hav­ing a crewed space sta­tion by 2022 and of even­tu­ally send­ing hu­mans to the Moon.</p>
    <p>The Chang’e-5 space­craft – named for the myth­i­cal Chi­nese moon god­dess – touched down on the near side of the Moon on Tues­day and is now gath­er­ing sam­ples from the sur­face, said the China Na­tional Space Ad­min­is­tra­tion (CNSA).</p>
    <p>Chang’e-5’s goal is to col­lect lu­nar rocks and soil to help sci­en­tists learn about the Moon’s ori­gins, for­ma­tion and vol­canic ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>If the re­turn jour­ney is suc­cess­ful, China will be only the third coun­try to have re­trieved sam­ples from the Moon, fol­low­ing the United States and the then Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
    <p>This is the first such at­tempt since the Soviet Union’s Luna 24 mis­sion in 1976.</p>
    <p>State me­dia yes­ter­day de­scribed the mis­sion as “one of China’s most com­pli­cated and chal­leng­ing space mis­sions so far”.</p>
    <p>The probe had fin­ished drilling for sam­ples by yes­ter­day morn­ing and is now “gath­er­ing sur­face sam­ples as planned”, CNSA said.</p>
    <p>The probe was launched from China’s south­ern Hainan is­land last week and en­tered lu­nar or­bit last Satur­day af­ter a 112-hour jour­ney.</p>
    <p>State broad­caster CCTV showed rows of sci­en­tists at mis­sion con­trol, wearing blue jack­ets em­bla­zoned with Chi­nese flags, mon­i­tor­ing the probe, then clap­ping af­ter it suc­cess­fully touched down.</p>
    <p>A huge screen at the front of the room dis­played images sent by the</p>
    <p>probe of the grey lu­nar sur­face.</p>
    <p>The space­craft plans to col­lect 2kg of ma­te­rial in a pre­vi­ously un­ex­plored area known as Oceanus Pro­cel­larum (“Ocean of Storms”), a vast lava plain, ac­cord­ing to the science jour­nal Na­ture.</p>
    <p>The probe was de­signed to both</p>
    <p>get sam­ples from the Moon’s sur­face, as well as drill a 2m-deep hole and gather spec­i­mens from there, to en­sure a di­verse col­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>State me­dia said the craft was pre­par­ing for “around 48 hours” of tasks on the lu­nar sur­face.</p>
    <p>The sam­ples will then be re</p>
    <p>turned to Earth in a cap­sule pro­grammed to land in north­ern China’s In­ner Mon­go­lia re­gion this month, ac­cord­ing to the US Na­tional Aeronautic­s and Space Ad­min­is­tra­tion (Nasa).</p>
    <p>The mis­sion is tech­ni­cally chal­leng­ing and in­volves sev­eral in­no­va­tions not seen dur­ing pre­vi­ous at­tempts at col­lect­ing moon rocks, Har­vard-Smith­so­nian Cen­tre for As­tro­physics re­searcher Jonathan McDow­ell told Agence FrancePres­se last month.</p>
    <p>Dr Thomas Zur­buchen, a top of­fi­cial at Nasa’s science mis­sion direc­torate, con­grat­u­lated China on the land­ing.</p>
    <p>“This is no easy task,” he tweeted. “When the sam­ples col­lected on the Moon are re­turned to Earth, we hope ev­ery­one will ben­e­fit from be­ing able to study this pre­cious cargo that could ad­vance the in­ter­na­tional science com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>Un­der Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, plans for China’s “space dream”, as he calls it, have been put into over­drive. Bei­jing is look­ing to fi­nally catch up with the US and Rus­sia af­ter years of be­lat­edly match­ing their space mile­stones.</p>
    <p>China launched its first satel­lite in 1970, while hu­man space­flight took decades longer – with Mr Yang Li­wei be­com­ing China’s first “taiko­naut” in 2003.</p>
    <p>A Chi­nese lu­nar rover landed on the far side of the Moon in Jan­uary last year, in a global first that boosted Bei­jing’s as­pi­ra­tions to be­come a space su­per­power.</p>
    <p>The lat­est probe is among a slew of am­bi­tious tar­gets, which in­clude cre­at­ing a pow­er­ful rocket ca­pa­ble of de­liv­er­ing pay­loads heav­ier than those that Nasa and pri­vate rocket firm SpaceX can han­dle, a lu­nar base and a per­ma­nently crewed space sta­tion.</p>
    <p>China’s taiko­nauts and sci­en­tists have also talked up crewed mis­sions to Mars.</p>
