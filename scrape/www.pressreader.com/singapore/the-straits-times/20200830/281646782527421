    <p>Soon af­ter the news broke about its bid for New­cas­tle United, ques­tions about the Bel­la­graph Nova (BN) Group sur­faced on­line.</p>
    <p>For one thing, no one had heard of the group, and while there were write-ups and press re­leases about the Loh cousins on­line, there was hardly any­thing about their strik­ing, blonde-haired busi­ness part­ner Evangeline Shen.</p>
    <p>On Aug 22, Reuters re­ported the group’s spokesman ad­mit­ting that some pub­lic­ity pho­tos of the co-founders with former United States pres­i­dent Barack Obama had been pho­to­shopped.</p>
    <p>Mr Nerei­des An­to­nio Gi­a­mundo de Bour­bon, BN Group’s head of global mar­ket­ing and in­vestor re­la­tions, also con­ceded that some of the in­for­ma­tion in its pub­lic­ity ma­te­ri­als had been re­leased pre­ma­turely or con­tained er­rors.</p>
    <p>But the Paris-based French­man main­tained “there wasn’t any ma­li­cious aim” be­hind the pho­tos, that they were “se­ri­ous peo­ple”, and “some­times the mar­ket­ing moves faster than the process”.</p>
    <p>In the past week, how­ever, more ques­tions have been raised.</p>
    <p>In the wake of this, the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change’s reg­u­la­tory arm has stepped in to ques­tion the “ex­pe­ri­ence, ex­per­tise, char­ac­ter and in­tegrity” of the board of Ax­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>The pro­fes­sional ser­vices com­pany, listed on the ju­nior Catal­ist bourse, was bought over by the cousins last month. It is their only known listed en­tity in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The Lohs are not di­rec­tors of Ax­ing­ton, but Ms Shen is its non-in­de­pen­dent, non-ex­ec­u­tive chair­man.</p>
    <p>Former United States am­bas­sador to Sin­ga­pore Kirk Wa­gar told The Straits Times last week that he had re­signed from Ax­ing­ton’s board be­cause of “re­cent rev­e­la­tions”.</p>
    <p>Trad­ing of the counter was halted, and an extraordin­ary gen­eral meet­ing, ear­lier sched­uled for last Thurs­day to vote for a change of name and busi­ness, among other things, was post­poned.</p>
    <p>Other in­di­vid­u­als and or­gan­i­sa­tions have de­nied links claimed by the group.</p>
    <p>The trio have cho­sen not to give in­ter­views de­spite re­quests. In­stead, the group is­sued a statement on Tues­day blam­ing “er­rant in­di­vid­u­als, pos­si­bly with ma­li­cious in­tent” be­hind the con­tro­ver­sial ma­te­ri­als. It said “in­de­pen­dent coun­sel” has been hired to in­ves­ti­gate the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The cousins fur­ther claimed “er­rant in­di­vid­u­als” had pre­ma­turely up­loaded a web­site of their foun­da­tion, which con­tained ques­tion­able in­for­ma­tion pointed out by The Straits Times.</p>
