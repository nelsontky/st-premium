    <p>I thank the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity for heed­ing my ap­peal and de­ploy­ing grass-cut­ters to clear a patch of over­grown grass next to my es­tate, which could have pro­vided a mos­quito-breed­ing habi­tat.</p>
    <p>And hav­ing watched par­lia­men­tary ses­sions overseas de­scend into may­hem and phys­i­cal con­fronta­tion, I am also happy to know that an able and ca­pa­ble team of op­po­si­tion MPs will be present to as­sist the Gov­ern­ment in ful­fill­ing the prom­ises it made in its man­i­festo, which in­clude cre­at­ing jobs and help­ing the poor and strug­gling.</p>
    <p>I look for­ward to the con­tin­ued peace and racial har­mony that Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens have been blessed with.</p>
    <p>I write to thank a Sin­ga­porean cou­ple for their kind ges­ture to help my daugh­ter who is study­ing in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>I met Mrs Liu by chance at a book­store last year. My wife and I chat­ted with her, and she gave us in­sights into the Sin­ga­pore ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem and the chal­lenges ahead. Since then, we have kept in touch.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker in Sin­ga­pore, my 15-year-old daugh­ter was on her own with­out a lap­top, and she asked us for help. My search for a re­li­able used lap­top re­tailer led me to con­tact many peo­ple, but my at­tempts were un­suc­cess­ful un­til I reached out to Mrs Liu, who was in Aus­tralia un­der lock­down at the time.</p>
    <p>She con­tacted her hus­band in Sin­ga­pore, who, with­out hes­i­tat­ing, bought a brand-new lap­top and sent it to my daugh­ter’s hos­tel within three hours. He told me that it was a present for my daugh­ter. His un­wa­ver­ing kind­ness to­wards a stranger touched the hearts of my fam­ily and me.</p>
    <p>Last week, I with­drew $80 from my POSB ac­count, but re­alised a few hours later that I had for­got­ten to re­trieve the money from the ATM.</p>
    <p>I called the bank’s hot­line and in­formed it of what had hap­pened. Ten min­utes later, I re­ceived an SMS telling me that the $80 had been cred­ited back to my ac­count.</p>
    <p>I thank POSB for its first-class ser­vice.</p>
