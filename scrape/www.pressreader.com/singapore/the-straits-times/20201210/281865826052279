    <p>North Korea lashed out at South Korean For­eign Min­is­ter Kang Kyung-wha for cast­ing doubt over its claim that there were no coro­n­avirus out­breaks there, warn­ing of con­se­quences for her “im­pu­dent” com­ment, state me­dia re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Dr Kang said on Satur­day that it was “hard to be­lieve” that North Korea had no Covid-19 cases even as the coun­try has been mak­ing all-out ef­forts to pre­vent the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>North Korea has not of­fi­cially con­firmed any in­fec­tions, though it has said there were thou­sands of “sus­pected cases”.</p>
    <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s sis­ter Kim Yo Jong, who serves as a se­nior rul­ing Work­ers’ Party of­fi­cial, is­sued a state­ment to the of­fi­cial KCNA news agency, say­ing Dr Kang’s re­marks were in­tended to fur­ther strain in­ter-Korean ties.</p>
    <p>“It can be seen from the reck­less re­marks made by her with­out any con­sid­er­a­tion of the con­se­quences that she is too ea­ger to fur­ther chill the frozen re­la­tions,” Ms Kim said.</p>
    <p>“We will never for­get her words and she might have to pay dearly for it.”</p>
    <p>South Korean Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in and Mr Kim held three sum­mits in 2018, but the re­la­tions have made lit­tle progress since a failed 2019 sum­mit in Hanoi be­tween Mr Kim and US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, which Mr Moon had of­fered to me­di­ate.</p>
    <p>The North’s Korean Cen­tral News Agency said last week that the coun­try has im­posed “top­class emer­gency mea­sures” to stop the coro­n­avirus mak­ing in­roads.</p>
    <p>Seoul’s Na­tional In­tel­li­gence Ser­vice has said an out­break in the North can­not be ruled out as it had trade and peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­changes with China, where the virus was first de­tected a year ago, be­fore seal­ing the bor­der in late Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>The KCNA re­port came as US Deputy Sec­re­tary of State Stephen Biegun, Wash­ing­ton’s point man on North Korea who had led de­nu­cle­ari­sa­tion talks, ar­rived in Seoul late on Mon­day on his pos­si­bly last trip be­fore a new US ad­min­is­tra­tion un­der Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den takes of­fice next month.</p>
    <p>Py­ongyang has not is­sued a for­mal re­sponse to the Nov 3 US elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Biegun yes­ter­day told South Korea’s Deputy For­eign Min­is­ter Choi Jong-kun that the trust and al­liance be­tween Wash­ing­ton and Seoul will re­main firm re­gard­less of the up­com­ing change in ad­min­is­tra­tions.</p>
    <p>The United States has black­listed six com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing sev­eral based in China, as well as four ships ac­cused of il­licit ex­ports of North Korean coal, the Trea­sury Depart­ment said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The United Na­tions Se­cu­rity Coun­cil banned North Korean coal ex­ports in 2017. The 15-mem­ber body has unan­i­mously boosted sanc­tions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off fund­ing for Py­ongyang’s nu­clear and bal­lis­tic mis­sile pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>When asked about the US ac­tion at a reg­u­lar news brief­ing in Bei­jing yes­ter­day, Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian said China has ful­filled its in­ter­na­tional obli­ga­tions, and op­posed coun­tries im­ple­ment­ing uni­lat­eral sanc­tions against Chi­nese com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>The black­listed ships – Calm Bridge, Asia Bridge, Lucky Star and Star 18 – “loaded coal di­rectly from North Korean ports and trans­ported their cargo through­out the re­gion”, the US Trea­sury Depart­ment said.</p>
    <p>The ship­ping com­pa­nies sanc­tioned are China-based Wei­hai Hui­jiang Trade, Al­ways Smooth, and Good Sib­lings. Al­ways Smooth and Good Sib­lings are also reg­is­tered in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>The Trea­sury Depart­ment also des­ig­nated Hong Kong-based Sil­ver Bridge Ship­ping Co-HKG, Viet­nam-based Thinh Cuong and Korea Daizin Trad­ing Cor­po­ra­tion, which op­er­ates in North Korea and Viet­nam.</p>
