    <p>•</p>
    <p>Tokyo Olympics or­gan­is­ers wrapped up three days of tests on Wed­nes­day, tri­alling a num­ber of se­cu­rity and Covid-19 coun­ter­mea­sures and ask­ing sup­port­ers and of­fi­cials to pack less to wait less when en­ter­ing venues dur­ing the Games.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the tests at Tokyo Big Sight, a con­ven­tion cen­tre that will host lo­cal and in­ter­na­tional me­dia or­gan­i­sa­tions dur­ing the post­poned Games, or­gan­is­ers as­sessed var­i­ous tech­nolo­gies to mon­i­tor body tem­per­a­tures of spec­ta­tors.</p>
    <p>As seen at other sport­ing events dur­ing the global pan­demic, ther­mog­ra­phy cam­eras and non-con­tact in­frared ther­mome­ters were used but or­gan­is­ers also tested the use of “ther­mome­ter strips”.</p>
    <p>The strips, which were pasted onto the wrists of vol­un­teers be­ing used in the trial, con­tain heat-sen­si­tive liq­uid crys­tals and can de­tect if the wearer has a fever.</p>
    <p>An­other key el­e­ment of the field test was check­ing how smoothly spec­ta­tors can pass through the in­spec­tion area while other mea­sures, such as so­cial dis­tanc­ing in queues, are be­ing en­forced.</p>
    <p>Vol­un­teers pre­sented se­cu­rity per­son­nel with more than 40 dif­fer­ent sce­nar­ios, in­clud­ing for­get­ting to wear a mask and try­ing to bring an aerosol can through se­cu­rity, to test their readi­ness for the Games.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers were happy with the test­ing but said more tri­als will be needed when full Covid-19 pro­to­cols are de­cided.</p>
    <p>“Pack less, wait less. We don’t want to de­lay the ex­cite­ment, so please come with very lit­tle lug­gage,” urged Tokyo 2020 se­cu­rity di­rec­tor Tsuyoshi Iwashita.</p>
    <p>“For the test­ing of se­cu­rity mea­sures, prob­a­bly this is the last one. As for Covid-19, when we fi­nalise the mea­sures, we want to check these pro­cesses. To do so, we will set up fur­ther types of test­ing.”</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers have yet to de­cide whether fans will be al­lowed into venues dur­ing the Olympics, which run from July 23 to Aug 8 next year.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee pres­i­dent Thomas Bach has said or­gan­is­ers ex­pect to wel­come spec­ta­tors from around the world, although it is un­sure the sort of ca­pac­ity that will be al­lowed.</p>
    <p>Doubts, how­ever, re­main over the vi­a­bil­ity of the Olympics amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, with al­most 80 per cent of Games vol­un­teers con­cerned about its spread.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey done by the Tokyo Metropoli­tan Govern­ment (TMG), al­most half of 13,000 re­spon­dents are also wor­ried about the im­pact the de­lay will have “on the level of en­thu­si­asm”.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to the find­ings, TMG said it has been cre­at­ing “in­fec­tion con­trol man­u­als” to en­sure a safe and se­cure en­vi­ron­ment for vol­un­teer ac­tiv­i­ties and that fur­ther train­ing would be pro­vided.</p>
    <p>On­line train­ing will con­tinue un­til next March, when the vol­un­teers will be no­ti­fied of which role they will fill at the Games.</p>
