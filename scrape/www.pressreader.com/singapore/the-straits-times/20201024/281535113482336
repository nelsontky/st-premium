    <p>Axel Tuanzebe is set to re­tain his place in the Manch­ester United side when they host Chelsea in the Pre­mier League to­day. The Red Devils, who have been strug­gling de­fen­sively, did not sign a cen­tre-back dur­ing the sum­mer trans­fer win­dow. But Tuanzebe had a good per­for­mance against Paris Saint-Ger­main mid­week and could fill in again as Eric Bailly is out and there are fit­ness doubts over Harry Maguire.</p>
    <p>LON­DON • The an­swer to Manch­ester United’s back­line dilemma may have been right un­der Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer’s nose the whole time.</p>
    <p>The Red Devils’ start to the new Pre­mier League cam­paign has been roundly crit­i­cised fol­low­ing de­feats by Crys­tal Palace (3-1) and Tot­ten­ham (6-1), with fans un­happy at the lack of a cen­tre-back sign­ing dur­ing the trans­fer win­dow.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a 4-1 vic­tory at New­cas­tle last week­end, fol­lowed by an im­pres­sive 2-1 win at Paris Saint-Ger­main (PSG) in mid­week, have si­lenced the crit­ics for the mo­ment.</p>
    <p>United got their Cham­pi­ons League cam­paign off to a flyer af­ter a stand­out per­for­mance by Axel Tuanzebe to shut down the likes of Ney­mar, Kylian Mbappe and An­gel di Maria.</p>
    <p>Not only was it the academy prod­uct’s first game in 10 months, but it was also his first start this year yet the 22-year-old did not put a foot wrong at the Parc des Princes.</p>
    <p>With Eric Bailly out and doubts over Harry Maguire, Tuanzebe is set to re­tain his place – some­thing that pun­dits have called for – when Chelsea visit Old Traf­ford to­day.</p>
    <p>The chal­lenge for the for­mer Eng­land Un­der-21 in­ter­na­tional is whether he can stay fit, ac­cord­ing to Sol­sk­jaer.</p>
    <p>Since be­ing pro­moted to the first team five years ago, Tuanzebe has started only 12 times for United due to a string of in­juries and the Nor­we­gian wants him to be­come more durable.</p>
    <p>At his pre-match vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, he said: “It was a great per­for­mance by a kid who’s not played for 10 months.</p>
    <p>“De­lighted for him be­cause he is such a pro­fes­sional char­ac­ter, he wants every­thing, he works re­ally hard, been re­ally, re­ally thor­ough in his re­hab, and I am very pleased for him.</p>
    <p>“Now to get consistenc­y in his per­for­mances, he’s got to stay in­juryfree, we have to man­age that. That’s mine and his job, and the physio staff’s job, of course. But I think he can kick on.</p>
    <p>“He’s such a leader. He can play right-back, cen­tre-back, cen­tral mid­field, he can play many po­si­tions and he’s a boy who takes re­spon­si­bil­ity for his own devel­op­ment and I’m sure he’s do­ing every­thing he can to have a long ca­reer at United.</p>
    <p>“So hope­fully, we can get that consistenc­y.”</p>
    <p>For­mer United striker Dim­i­tar Ber­ba­tov agreed, telling Bet­fair yes­ter­day that Tuanzebe had played his way into Sol­sk­jaer’s plans.</p>
    <p>He added: “I said pre-sea­son that (the club) needed a cen­tre-back, but maybe all along Axel has been there, and he is a strong can­di­date to be first choice.”</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer also re­vealed that fel­low youth team grad­u­ate Ma­son Green­wood would have a late fit­ness test, but new sign­ing Edin­son Ca­vani was rar­ing to go amid the pos­si­bil­ity of his de­but against Chelsea.</p>
    <p>The for­mer PSG striker, signed on a free trans­fer on dead­line day, has yet to play due to a pre­cau­tion­ary quar­an­tine spell amid the Covid-19 pan­demic and fit­ness is­sues, but has made an im­pres­sion in train­ing.</p>
    <p>“He might be ready for the squad as well for this week­end,” Sol­sk­jaer said.</p>
    <p>“He’s been train­ing hard and been train­ing well. I think he’ll be avail­able for the week­end.”</p>
    <p>The Blues have no fit­ness wor­ries other than the ab­sence of Billy Gil­mour, with Edouard Mendy set to keep the No. 1 spot ahead of fel­low goal­keeper Kepa Ar­riz­a­bal­aga. MAN UNITED V CHELSEA</p>

    <p>LON­DON • Amid the eu­pho­ria of re-sign­ing Gareth Bale on a sea­son­long loan from Real Madrid, Car­los Vini­cius has slipped un­der the radar of Tot­ten­ham fans.</p>
    <p>The Brazil­ian striker moved from Ben­fica on a sea­son-long loan ear­lier this month, be­fore fi­nally mak­ing his de­but on Thurs­day, along­side Bale as Spurs took on Aus­tria’s Lask i n their Group J Europa League opener.</p>
    <p>He up­staged his more il­lus­tri­ous team­mate, who made his first start of the cam­paign, lay­ing on goals for Lu­cas Moura and sub­sti­tute Son He­ung-min in ei­ther half for a 3-0 home win.</p>
    <p>An own goal by An­dres An­drade sand­wiched the strikes, lead­ing Mour­inho to pre­dict there would be more to come from Vini­cius once he set­tles into life in Eng­land and learns English.</p>
    <p>“It’s a bit of a shame still, it’s not easy not to speak English, so the adap­tion to the group in spite of hav­ing amaz­ing guys that try to make him feel well, isn’t easy,” the Spurs man­ager told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“But we can see he’s much more... he’s not self­ish, he’s a good tar­get man, he can even play with Harry Kane when his good pe­riod ar­rives... and not just be the guy to cover him.”</p>
    <p>Vini­cius’ abil­ity to play as the main man up front al­lowed Mour­inho to have the op­por­tu­nity to rest first-choice striker Kane ahead of Mon­day’s Pre­mier League trip to Burn­ley and Brazil­ian Moura also be­lieves that he can push for a start­ing place.</p>
    <p>“Car­los did very well to­day,” he said. “He did two as­sists and made a good game. He’s the kind of player we missed in this squad, an­other No. 9. An­other Brazil­ian as well is good for me.”</p>
    <p>In Group B, Arse­nal scored twice in four min­utes to win 2-1 at Rapid Vi­enna and spare goal­keeper Bernd Leno’s blushes af­ter his blun­der handed the Aus­tri­ans a shock lead.</p>
    <p>Tax­i­archis Foun­tas cap­i­talised on the er­ror to put the hosts ahead in the se­cond half be­fore David Luiz’s equaliser and a tap-in by sub­sti­tute Pierre-Em­er­ick Aubameyang.</p>
    <p>It was an over­all lethar­gic per­for­mance by the Gun­ners with the ex­cep­tion of Thomas Partey.</p>
    <p>The Ghana mid­fielder, signed on dead­line day for £45 mil­lion (S$80 mil­lion), made his first start for the club and pun­dits raved over his all-ac­tion dis­play.</p>
    <p>For­mer Arse­nal de­fender Martin Ke­own com­pared him to club great Pa­trick Vieira, while for­mer Manch­ester United mid­fielder Owen Har­g­reaves said it was “one of the best de­buts I’ve ever seen”.</p>
