    <p>•</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment is mulling over tougher re­stric­tions in Eng­land to tackle a swiftly ac­cel­er­at­ing sec­ond wave of the coro­n­avirus out­break, pos­si­bly out­law­ing more in­ter-house­hold so­cial­is­ing, a ju­nior health min­is­ter said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We don’t want to bring on new re­stric­tions but, of course, we keep a con­stant eye on what is go­ing on with the Covid rate,” Ju­nior Health Min­is­ter He­len Whately told Sky News.</p>
    <p>The Times news­pa­per said min­is­ters were pre­par­ing to en­force a to­tal so­cial lock­down across much of north­ern Eng­land and po­ten­tially Lon­don. The pa­per said all pubs, restau­rants and bars would be or­dered to shut for two weeks.</p>
    <p>Asked about The Times re­port, Mrs Whately said the coun­try was at a re­ally se­ri­ous point and so Covid-19 had to be brought un­der con­trol. She did not give a di­rect an­swer on the re­port that pubs would be closed.</p>
    <p>“This is the mo­ment when we have an op­por­tu­nity – we have a choice for the coun­try – to get this back un­der con­trol. We have to break these chains of trans­mis­sion,” Mrs Whately said.</p>
    <p>In Spain, pro­test­ers hit the streets of Madrid against coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions on Sun­day, the day be­fore a par­tial lock­down was ex­tended to more ar­eas of the cap­i­tal re­gion to curb a surge in coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>The city with its sur­round­ing re­gion is at the epi­cen­tre of a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions sweep­ing Spain. Covid-19 has al­ready claimed more than 31,000 lives na­tion­wide, the high­est in­fec­tion rate in the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>Since Sept 21, some 850,000 peo­ple in 37 mainly densely pop­u­lated low-in­come dis­tricts in south­ern Madrid have been con­fined to their neigh­bour­hoods, un­able to leave ex­cept for work, school or med­i­cal rea­sons – al­though they are able to move freely within their own ar­eas. Parks in the af­fected neigh­bour­hoods are closed and restau­rants and other busi­nesses must shut at 10pm.</p>
    <p>The re­gional gov­ern­ment of Madrid, which is re­spon­si­ble for health, ex­tended the re­stric­tions from yes­ter­day to eight more dis­tricts, home to an­other 167,000 peo­ple. Its lat­est move still falls short of a rec­om­men­da­tion from Spain’s gov­ern­ment that the par­tial lock­down should cover the en­tire city.</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of peo­ple gath­ered out­side the Madrid re­gional Par­lia­ment in south­ern district Val­le­cas, one of the neigh­bour­hoods un­der par­tial lock­down since last week, to protest against the re­stric­tions. Many com­plained of dis­crim­i­na­tion by the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“It’s not lock­down, it’s seg­re­ga­tion!” the crowd chanted. One of the signs on dis­play stated: “They don’t con­fine the rich.”</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar smaller demon­stra­tions were held in other parts of the city.</p>
    <p>“It makes no sense that you can go to work in a wealth­ier area but can’t go have a drink,” Mr Mar­cos Ruiz Gui­jarro, 27, said. “In­fec­tions are ris­ing ev­ery­where. The rules should be the same for ev­ery­one.”</p>
    <p>Many de­mon­stra­tors com­plained that the re­gional gov­ern­ment had failed to im­prove public health­care or do any­thing to re­duce over­crowd­ing in the trans­port sys­tem, where they said the virus could eas­ily spread. The re­gional gov­ern­ment said it has tar­geted ar­eas where the con­ta­gion rate is above 1,000 cases per 100,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Over the past week, Spain has reg­is­tered the high­est num­ber of new cases within the EU, with a rate of nearly 300 per 100,000 in­hab­i­tants – but in the Madrid re­gion, the fig­ure is more than 700 per 100,000.</p>
