    <p>Covid-19 cases world­wide have crossed the 31 mil­lion mark and fa­tal­i­ties linked to it are ap­proach­ing a mil­lion. While the United States tops the mor­bid­ity count with over seven mil­lion cases, India, with nearly 5.5 mil­lion, now has the sec­ond high­est num­ber of recorded cases world­wide – and by most ac­counts, the dis­ease is out of con­trol across the vast na­tion. Euro­pean na­tions from Den­mark to Spain have an­nounced new re­stric­tions to curb surg­ing num­bers in their cities, and in Britain, Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son, who not long ago spoke of the “in­alien­able right of the Bri­tish to go to the pub”, has hinted at a sec­ond lock­down amid an “in­evitable” sec­ond wave. Even Sin­ga­pore has had more than 57,600 cases and 27 deaths.</p>
    <p>The cost in terms of hu­man life and liveli­hood is al­ready colos­sal, with no end in sight. Jobs con­tinue to be shed in coun­tries at a fright­en­ing pace as many com­pa­nies tighten their belts in the face of col­laps­ing de­mand and dwin­dling state sup­port. Against this back­ground, some ar­gue that only a form of herd im­mu­nity can be a bul­wark against the dis­ease. But sci­en­tists es­ti­mate that it might take two-thirds of the pop­u­la­tion to gain im­mu­nity be­fore this is reached. Hence only the in­tro­duc­tion of an ef­fec­tive and in­ex­pen­sive vac­cine is the real an­ti­dote, since with this peo­ple can de­velop im­mu­nity with­out con­tract­ing the coro­n­avirus. If not, the cost to so­ci­ety and economies would sim­ply con­tinue to be cat­a­strophic.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, peo­ple are gen­er­ally known to be so­cially aware and cooper­a­tive. But even here, Covid-19 weari­ness, con­fi­dence stem­ming from im­prov­ing knowl­edge about treat­ing the dis­ease, and the ev­i­dent suc­cess in pre­vent­ing it from spread­ing too widely in the community have led some to feel they can af­ford to drop their guard. Last week­end, for in­stance, crowds were spot­ted at food and bev­er­age es­tab­lish­ments in places such as Tan­jong Pa­gar and Bugis. While all wore masks, too many were seen in close prox­im­ity to one an­other. Some restau­rants have also re­ported at­tempts to game the rules, with groups mak­ing mul­ti­ple book­ings to get around safe dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>All this is a pity. The dyke against this tsunami of a dis­ease can hold only if in­di­vid­u­als play their part to en­sure there is no breach in the wall. Frus­trat­ing as it is to have to mask up in pub­lic, re­frain from din­ing out in large groups and limit the num­bers who can at­tend events such as wed­dings, sen­si­ble curbs on free move­ment and assembly nev­er­the­less re­main the first line of de­fence and an en­dur­ing and prac­ti­cal weapon in the fight against the dis­ease. All the more rea­son that a few head­strong risk-tak­ers should not be the cause for the wider so­ci­ety to suf­fer – if not by them con­tract­ing the virus, then from the real po­ten­tial of a tighter clampdown on mix­ing and move­ment. The gains of the past few months must be pre­served.</p>
