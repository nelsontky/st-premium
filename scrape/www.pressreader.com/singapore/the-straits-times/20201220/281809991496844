    <p>Dream­ing of be­com­ing the next Steve Jobs, a young woman teams up with a geeky trio of male de­vel­op­ers to start a small com­pany in South Korea’s Sil­i­con Valley.</p>
    <p>This may be the premise of the pop­u­lar South Korean drama StartUp, but it is also a true re­flec­tion of the coun­try’s vi­brant start-up scene in real life.</p>
    <p>Statis­tics show that more women are ven­tur­ing into the tra­di­tion­ally male-driven start-up scene. Women are now be­hind more than 25 per cent of new start-ups here – up from about 9 per cent four years ago – in sec­tors rang­ing from fi­nance to fash­ion, food, education and health­care.</p>
    <p>For­mer Gold­man Sachs an­a­lyst So­phie Kim, who founded pre­mium gro­cery de­liv­ery ser­vice Mar­ket Kurly in 2015, is ar­guably the most suc­cess­ful of them all.</p>
    <p>She has been able to raise US$282 mil­lion (S$374 mil­lion) in fund­ing to date as her com­pany grew in size and rev­enue, boosted this year by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, which drove large num­bers of peo­ple to or­der their gro­ceries on­line.</p>
    <p>Fo­cused on fresh food and fine food items not com­monly found in depart­ment stores, Mar­ket Kurly was the first to in­tro­duce overnight de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers who place an or­der on the com­pany’s web­site or app by 11pm will re­ceive their goods be­fore 7am the fol­low­ing day.</p>
    <p>Ms Kim, who has also worked for Sin­ga­pore’s Te­masek, told The Sun­day Times that her com­pany earned cus­tomer trust by sell­ing only qual­ity prod­ucts that she and her fam­ily would per­son­ally want to buy.</p>
    <p>The 37-year-old said: “We want to es­tab­lish our­selves as a brand that can re­ceive ab­so­lute trust from cus­tomers based on our com­mit­ment to prod­uct qual­ity, a de­liv­ery sys­tem that pur­sues per­fec­tion and our com­mit­ment to the voice of the cus­tomer.”</p>
    <p>An­other fe­male force to be reck­oned with is Ms Lee Hyo-jin, founder of 8per­cent, a peer-to-peer lend­ing start-up that matches len­ders with cash-strapped in­di­vid­u­als or com­pa­nies by me­di­at­ing</p>
    <p>mid-range in­ter­est rates.</p>
    <p>In­spired by United States peerto-peer com­pany Lend­ingClub, she started the com­pany in 2014.</p>
    <p>It has since re­viewed 1.4 mil­lion per­sonal loan ap­pli­ca­tions and draws in­vestors from not only South Korea but also over­seas, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee, who used to work at Woori Bank, one of South Korea’s largest do­mes­tic banks, told The Sun­day Times that she hopes to cre­ate a “vir­tu­ous cy­cle of fi­nance” – whereby a bor­rower gets through rough times and re­turns as a lender or in­vestor – as well as re­duce house­hold debt.</p>
    <p>“Through this, I would like to con­trib­ute to the restora­tion of the mid­dle class, re­vi­talise our so­ci­ety and give many peo­ple a more re­laxed life,” she added.</p>
    <p>She has had to deal with her share of gen­der bi­ases.</p>
    <p>Be it in South Korea or glob­ally, re­search shows that women are dis­crim­i­nated against dur­ing pitches, as in­vestors tend to ques­tion them about risks and losses, whereas men are asked about their am­bi­tions and achieve­ments.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee, 37, said when she at­tends business meet­ings with a male col­league, “many peo­ple will think he is our com­pany’s founder”.</p>
    <p>“We also have vis­i­tors who ask, ‘Where is the CEO?’ be­cause they</p>
    <p>don’t think that I could be the CEO.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, she noted that mind­sets in South Korea, a tra­di­tion­ally pa­tri­ar­chal, Con­fu­cian so­ci­ety, have changed for the bet­ter over the past two decades.</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, the gov­ern­ment has also tried to en­cour­age more women to stay in the work­force, in­tro­duc­ing nu­mer­ous schemes and of­fer­ing fund­ing to help them start their own busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>A stronger sup­port net­work is also in place.</p>
    <p>Face­book com­mu­nity Startup Women in Korea, for in­stance, has over 5,000 mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Even so, Ms Lee of 8per­cent warned that the start-up jour­ney re­quires long, te­dious hours of work and things may not turn out the way one in­tends in the first few years.</p>
    <p>“It would be good to ask your­self if this is what you re­ally want to do and if you can con­tinue to have a sense of duty to run the business,” said Ms Lee, who is mar­ried with a five-year-old daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>“As you choose a life dif­fer­ent from oth­ers, you have to over­come the dif­fi­cul­ties that come with it.”</p>
    <p>Some of the chal­lenges are por­trayed in the drama Start-Up, which stars Bae Suzy as the main pro­tag­o­nist Dal-mi, who joins a start-up in­cu­ba­tor called Sand­box and ex­plores var­i­ous business ideas with her team.</p>
    <p>The drama ended its run in South Korea on Dec 6 but is still ranked No. 3 on Net­flix.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee said she watched some episodes.</p>
    <p>She praised the app that Dal-mi cre­ated, which uses ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence to help blind peo­ple nav­i­gate.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one dreams of hav­ing an op­por­tu­nity to re­alise their ideas, and en­trepreneur­s want to pro­mote their ser­vices to ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>“This is a dif­fi­cult task, but the drama ful­fils that dream for peo­ple.”</p>
