    <p>All trav­ellers from In­dia who are not Sin­ga­pore­ans or per­ma­nent res­i­dents will have to take a Covid-19 test be­fore de­part­ing for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>From next Thurs­day, they will have to present a valid neg­a­tive test re­sult from a poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test, which must be taken within 72 hours be­fore their flight here.</p>
    <p>This new and more strin­gent bor­der re­stric­tion, which cov­ers trav­ellers who were in In­dia within 14 days of their ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, will ap­ply on top of ex­ist­ing re­quire­ments – a two-week stay-home no­tice (SHN) at ded­i­cated SHN fa­cil­i­ties and a fur­ther neg­a­tive Covid-19 test be­fore the end of the SHN.</p>
    <p>An­nounc­ing this yes­ter­day, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) noted re­ports of a resur­gence of Covid-19 in­fec­tions in In­dia. A “sig­nif­i­cant num­ber” of im­ported cases in Sin­ga­pore also have re­cent travel his­tory to In­dia, it said.</p>
    <p>A one-year-old Sin­ga­porean baby who had re­turned from In­dia on Aug 24 was the only im­ported case on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, two of the three im­ported cases came from In­dia. The third case was from the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>In­dia re­ported 89,706 new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions yes­ter­day, tak­ing its to­tal num­ber to 4.3 mil­lion, mak­ing it the coun­try with the sec­ond­high­est num­ber of cases af­ter the United States.</p>
    <p>MOH said it will con­tinue to ad­just bor­der mea­sures to man­age the risk of im­port­ing more cases that may lead to trans­mis­sion in the broader com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>It said trav­ellers should be pre­pared to face these con­trol mea­sures on en­try, in­clud­ing pay­ment for their stay at SHN fa­cil­i­ties and for tests.</p>
