    <p>LIS­BON • An in­spired Ney­mar helped Paris Saint-Ger­main reach their first Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal with a 3-0 win on Tues­day. But the fact that the Brazil­ian was not their best player against RB Leipzig says ev­ery­thing about the strength of Thomas Tuchel’s team.</p>
    <p>Ney­mar has been in­stru­men­tal to his team’s ex­ploits in Lis­bon in his third year with PSG. His first two sea­sons in France fol­low­ing his €222 mil­lion (S$361 mil­lion) trans­fer from Barcelona were blighted by in­juries and spec­u­la­tion about a move back to Spain.</p>
    <p>This term, he scored in both legs against Borus­sia Dort­mund in the last 16, just be­fore the coro­n­avirus brought foot­ball to a halt. He was then out­stand­ing in the 2-1 quar­ter-fi­nal win over Ata­lanta l ast week and even bet­ter in the de­mo­li­tion of Leipzig.</p>
    <p>He hit the post twice in the first half, in­clud­ing an au­da­cious ef­fort from a free-kick wide on the right as every­one waited for a cross.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old also won the free-kick which led to Mar­quin­hos’ opener, and it was his flick which set up An­gel di Maria for the se­cond goal be­fore Juan Ber­nat sealed the win.</p>
    <p>Fel­low PSG star Kylian Mbappe be­lieves Ney­mar de­serves to be recog­nised as the world’s best player by Fifa this year.</p>
    <p>“If we win the Cham­pi­ons League, he will cer­tainly be in a po­si­tion to win the award,” said the French for­ward. “He is des­tined to win this type of tro­phy.”</p>
    <p>Yet, while Ney­mar and Mbappe, the two most ex­pen­sive foot­ballers of all time, dom­i­nated the head­lines, there were stand­out per­for­mances all through PSG’s team on Tues­day. In par­tic­u­lar, di Maria.</p>
    <p>The Ar­gen­tinian re­turned from sus­pen­sion to start against Leipzig and it was he who set up two goals ei­ther side of scor­ing him­self.</p>
    <p>While they were bright in at­tack, it was the French cham­pi­ons’ de­fence that was praised by Tuchel.</p>
    <p>PSG have con­ceded just five goals in 10 games, the best record in this sea­son’s Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>“I was never re­laxed, but how we de­fended was also the most im­por­tant thing for me. We had a good mix be­tween de­ter­mi­na­tion, spirit and qual­ity,” the Ger­man coach said.</p>
    <p>The show­ing was a sharp con­trast to gut-wrench­ing col­lapses and near misses that pre­vented PSG from reach­ing past Cham­pi­ons League fi­nals. On Sun­day, they will face ei­ther Bay­ern Mu­nich or fel­low French side Lyon.</p>
    <p>PSG were pre­vi­ously elim­i­nated by Real Madrid (2018) and Manch­ester City (2016). Last sea­son, they were knocked out by a last­minute goal by Manch­ester United.</p>
    <p>Most painful was the team’s 2017 elim­i­na­tion at the hands of Barcelona in the last 16, on the strength of a stun­ning 6-1 de­feat at the Nou Camp after PSG won the first leg at home 4-0.</p>
    <p>That de­feat was or­ches­trated by Ney­mar, then with the Cata­lans. Three years on, he is part of a win that marks the cul­mi­na­tion of a project that be­gan when Qatar Sports In­vest­ments, the Gulf na­tion’s sov­er­eign wealth fund, took over the club in 2011.</p>
    <p>Leipzig, founded in 2009, had to be con­tent with reach­ing the last four for the first time in the Red Bull-backed club’s brief 11-year ex­is­tence. “In the end the op­po­nents were sim­ply bet­ter than us, we have to ac­cept that,” RB Leipzig coach Ju­lian Nagels­mann said. “We won’t be the first team not to stop Ney­mar and we won’t be the last.”</p>
