    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den and his run­ning mate, Sen­a­tor Ka­mala Har­ris, were set to make their first ap­pear­ance as a ticket yes­ter­day in Wilm­ing­ton, Delaware, as the cam­paign for the White House en­ters a more fre­netic phase.</p>
    <p>The two were sched­uled to de­liver re­marks just days be­fore Mr Bi­den for­mally ac­cepts the party’s nom­i­na­tion dur­ing its na­tional con­ven­tion next week, which will take place largely as a vir­tual event due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den picked Ms Har­ris as his choice for vice-pres­i­dent on Tues­day, mak­ing her the first black woman on a ma­jor-party US pres­i­den­tial ticket and giv­ing him a part­ner well pre­pared to go on the at­tack against Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>With so­cial un­rest over racial in­jus­tice rock­ing the coun­try for months, Mr Bi­den had been un­der in­creas­ing pres­sure to se­lect a black woman as his run­ning mate.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris, whose mother and fa­ther em­i­grated from In­dia and Ja­maica re­spec­tively, is also the first Asian Amer­i­can on a ma­jor pres­i­den­tial ticket.</p>
    <p>In Ms Har­ris, a 55-year-old sen­a­tor from Cal­i­for­nia who made her own run for the White House, Mr Bi­den gains an ex­pe­ri­enced politi­cian al­ready battle-tested by the rigours of the 2020 pres­i­den­tial cam­paign as they head into the fi­nal stretch of the Nov 3 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>In a Twit­ter post on Tues­day, Mr Bi­den called Ms Har­ris “a fear­less fighter for the lit­tle guy, and one of the coun­try’s finest pub­lic ser­vants”.</p>
    <p>And Ms Har­ris wrote on Twit­ter that Mr Bi­den could “unify the Amer­i­can peo­ple be­cause he’s spent his life fight­ing for us”.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­cans im­me­di­ately tried to por­tray Ms Har­ris as a “rad­i­cal” who em­braces far-left pri­or­i­ties such as sweep­ing po­lice re­form and a ban on frack­ing.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a White House brief­ing later on Tues­day, Mr Trump called</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris “the mean­est, the most hor­ri­ble, most dis­re­spect­ful” as well as “most lib­eral” sen­a­tor. He also said she was his “No. 1 draft pick” given her un­suc­cess­ful pres­i­den­tial cam­paign.</p>
    <p>On a con­fer­ence call the Trump cam­paign hosted for re­porters, Repub­li­can Sen­a­tor Mar­sha Black­burn as­serted that Ms Har­ris sup­ports elim­i­nat­ing pri­vate in­surance in favour of “Medi­care for All” and said her se­lec­tion re­flects the “left­ist takeover” of the party.</p>
    <p>As a pres­i­den­tial can­di­date, Ms Har­ris had pro­posed a govern­ment-run sys­tem that would still al­low pri­vate in­sur­ers to of­fer plans; she also sup­ported a frack­ing ban.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has not em­braced ei­ther pro­posal.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris will be re­lied on to help mo­bilise African Amer­i­cans, the Demo­cratic Party’s most loyal con­stituency.</p>
    <p>Four years ago, the first dip in black voter turnout in 20 years con­trib­uted to Demo­crat Hil­lary Clin­ton’s up­set loss to Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, whose own founder­ing cam­paign was res­cued by black vot­ers in South Carolina’s pri­mary in Fe­bru­ary, needs their strong sup­port against Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>They will be cru­cial in bat­tle­ground states such as Michi­gan, Penn­syl­va­nia and Wis­con­sin, where Mr Trump nar­rowly pre­vailed in 2016, as well as Repub­li­can-lean­ing south­ern states like Ge­or­gia and Florida that opin­ion polls show have be­come com­pet­i­tive this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den served as vice-pres­i­dent for eight years un­der pres­i­dent Barack Obama, the first black US pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Nu­mer­ous black lead­ers, in­clud­ing politi­cians who had them­selves been con­sid­ered as Mr Bi­den’s run­ning mate, em­pha­sised the his­toric im­por­tance of Ms Har­ris’ se­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>“To see a black woman nom­i­nated for the first time reaf­firms my faith that in Amer­ica, there is a place for ev­ery per­son to suc­ceed no mat­ter who they are or where they come from,” said Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Val Dem­ings, a black woman who had been a con­tender.</p>
    <p>Mr Obama, per­haps the party’s most pop­u­lar fig­ure, praised Ms Har­ris on Twit­ter: “She’s spent her ca­reer de­fend­ing our Con­sti­tu­tion and fight­ing for folks who need a fair shake.”</p>
    <p>The Bi­den cam­paign notched its best grass­roots fundrais­ing day fol­low­ing the an­nounce­ment, ac­cord­ing to one of its dig­i­tal direc­tors, Mr Clarke Humphrey.</p>
    <p>Sen­a­tor Har­ris, a for­mer prose­cu­tor and state at­tor­ney-gen­eral in Cal­i­for­nia, is known for her some­times ag­gres­sive ques­tion­ing style in the Se­nate, most no­tably of Mr Brett Ka­vanaugh dur­ing his Supreme Court con­fir­ma­tion hear­ing in 2018.</p>
    <p>As a pres­i­den­tial can­di­date, she also took Mr Bi­den to task in a na­tion­ally tele­vised de­bate over his past stances on manda­tory bussing for stu­dents as a means to de­seg­re­gate schools.</p>
    <p>Some Bi­den ad­vis­ers have told Reuters that the at­tacks made them ques­tion whether she would be a trusted work­ing part­ner be­cause of her po­lit­i­cal am­bi­tions.</p>
    <p>While that ex­change failed to boost her White House hopes, the Bi­den cam­paign will now look for her to train her fire on Mr Trump and Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris is sched­uled to de­bate Mr Pence on Oct 7 in Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
    <p>The choice of a run­ning mate has added sig­nif­i­cance for Mr Bi­den, 77, who would be the old­est per­son to be­come pres­i­dent if he is elected.</p>
    <p>His age has led to spec­u­la­tion that he will serve only one term, mak­ing Ms Har­ris a po­ten­tial top con­tender for the pres­i­den­tial nom­i­na­tion in 2024.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den pub­licly com­mit­ted to choos­ing a woman as his No. 2 in a March de­bate, af­ter dis­cussing the mat­ter with his wife Jill.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the protests that erupted over the May 25 killing of Mr Ge­orge Floyd, a black man, by a white po­lice­man in Minneapoli­s, Mr Bi­den’s search fo­cused pre­dom­i­nantly on can­di­dates of colour.</p>
