    <p>Since phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing be­gan, I have ob­served chefs at restau­rants with open kitchens work­ing with­out wear­ing their masks over the nose and mouth.</p>
    <p>At one restau­rant, af­ter I pro­vided feed­back, the chef told me that while the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency has in­formed staff that mask wear­ing is es­sen­tial, it is very warm and hu­mid in the kitchen. He also said that the mask hin­ders his tast­ing of the food.</p>
    <p>At an­other restau­rant, I ges­tured at the chef to tell him to wear his mask. He did so, only to lower it be­low his chin when he turned around.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, hawk­ers are abid­ing by the rules, and I take my hat off to them.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, I also vis­ited a sport­ing goods re­tailer, and saw that some cus­tomers were en­ter­ing and ex­it­ing with­out check­ing in via SafeEn­try. I alerted the shop’s staff, and was told that it was short of staff to en­force the rule.</p>
    <p>A plat­form should be cre­ated to make it easy for peo­ple to take pho­tos of pan­demic rule break­ers and send them to the au­thor­i­ties, sim­i­lar to how peo­ple can re­port er­rant per­sonal mo­bil­ity de­vice users via the MyTrans­port.SG app.</p>
    <p>Let­ters should be meant for ex­clu­sive pub­li­ca­tion in The Straits Times. They should be no longer than 400 words and must in­clude the writer’s full name, ad­dress and phone num­bers. The Fo­rum editor re­serves the right to edit the let­ters. For women, please in­di­cate Miss, Ms, Mrs or Madam. Please e-mail your letter to stfo­rum@sph.com.sg. Read­ers can also re­spond to let­ters via Face­book and Twit­ter.</p>
