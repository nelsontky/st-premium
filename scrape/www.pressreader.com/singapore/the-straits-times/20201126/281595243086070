    <p>Sin­ga­pore has be­gun im­port­ing frozen shrimp from Saudi Arabia, the first time it is do­ing so from the</p>
    <p>Middle East­ern king­dom, as part of ef­forts to di­ver­sify its sup­ply chains to safe­guard food se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>The move could spark greater trade be­tween the two coun­tries as they start look­ing at the prod­ucts avail­able on both sides, said Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing at an event to mark the trade in shrimps yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He said: “Prior to this, I think very few of us would have thought of im­port­ing shrimp from Saudi Arabia. It is not some­thing that comes to mind. But now that we know this can be done, and it can be done in a very price-com­pet­i­tive man­ner, then we can explore with the Saudi em­bassy and sup­pli­ers on what other prod­ucts they can of­fer.</p>
    <p>“Like­wise, these Saudi sup­pli­ers have also seen the prod­ucts avail­able in both Sin­ga­pore and the re­gion, which they could also bring back to Saudi Arabia. So that’s how the na­ture of the trade flows con­tin­ues to im­prove, and as we go along, the price of the lo­gis­tics will con­tinue to come down, be­cause peo­ple be­come more ef­fi­cient.”</p>
    <p>The Seafood Com­pany manag­ing di­rec­tor Ken­neth Chua told re­porters at the event held at a FairPrice out­let in VivoCity that around 60 tonnes of shrimp have been im­ported so far, with an­other 60 tonnes ex­pected to be here by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>The shrimp, which are sourced from the Red Sea, are cur­rently sup­plied to FairPrice as well as restau</p>

    <p>rants and food­stalls.</p>
    <p>Mr Seah Kian Peng, group chief ex­ec­u­tive of FairPrice Group, said that Sin­ga­pore’s prawns are im­ported from all over the world. This in­cludes nearby coun­tries such as Thai­land, Malaysia and In­done­sia, and places as far as Canada and Ecuador.</p>
    <p>“This shows that we con­tinue to di­ver­sify our sources so that at any point in time, there will be min­i­mal, hope­fully no dis­rup­tion to sup­plies. At the same time... con­sumers can look for­ward to some­thing which is (com­pet­i­tive) in terms of taste, qual­ity and price,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Red Sea shrimp are be­ing sold at $13.90 for 800g. They are priced at a premium as they are known for their rich flavour, thanks to the Red Sea’s high salin­ity com­pared with sea­wa­ter i n other parts of the world.</p>
    <p>Other types of frozen shrimp sourced from places like Viet­nam and China are be­ing sold at around $10 for 1kg.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore cur­rently im­ports food from more than 170 coun­tries and re­gions.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said on the side­lines of the event that Sin­ga­pore is con­stantly on its feet in di­ver­si­fy­ing its food sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>He added: “At this point in time, it is not suf­fi­cient just to say which sup­ply chains might be dis­rupted. What is more im­por­tant is to have a sense of what are the sup­ply chains that might be dis­rupted in a few weeks’ time or a few months’ time, so that we can put in the or­ders and se­cure the sup­plies ahead of time.”</p>
