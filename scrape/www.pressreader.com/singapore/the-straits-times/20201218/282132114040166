    <p>All 113 cir­cuit breaker trip coils along the Tuas West Ex­ten­sion (TWE) on the East-West Line have been re­placed, with work to re­place 150km of power ca­bles along the stretch start­ing next month.</p>
    <p>Plans for these re­place­ment works had been an­nounced ear­lier af­ter a mas­sive three-line break­down left more than 6,700 pas­sen­gers stuck on stranded trains for up to three hours on Oct 14.</p>
    <p>The Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) said in an up­date yes­ter­day that it had worked with rail op­er­a­tor SMRT and main con­trac­tor Al­stom to change the trip coils.</p>
    <p>Trip coils are com­po­nents in cir­cuit break­ers which iso­late power faults.</p>
    <p>A faulty trip coil had failed to iso­late a fault on the TWE on Oct 14, which re­sulted in the prob­lem snow­balling.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion was made to re­place all trip coils along the stretch of the MRT line as a pre-emp­tive mea­sure against power ca­ble faults and po­ten­tial ser­vice dis­rup­tions, said LTA.</p>
    <p>It added that the early clo­sures car­ried out last month along the TWE helped to ac­cel­er­ate com­ple­tion of the trip coil re­place­ment pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>On the power ca­ble re­place­ment, LTA said that a new batch of higher-spec­i­fi­ca­tion ca­bles is sched­uled to ar­rive from this month.</p>
    <p>Work to re­place ex­ist­ing ca­bles will start next month on the sec­tion along Tuas De­pot In­take and Tuas Link sta­tion.</p>
    <p>LTA said: “For a start, these works will be car­ried out dur­ing nor­mal en­gi­neer­ing hours.</p>
    <p>“LTA and SMRT will sub­se­quently sched­ule early clo­sures/ late open­ings on week­ends or full Sun­day clo­sures from March to May 2021 along the TWE to speed up ca­ble re­place­ment work that is ex­pected to com­plete by end-2021.”</p>
    <p>It said the pub­lic will be given early no­tice of the sched­uled early clo­sure dates and af­fected sta­tions.</p>
    <p>SMRT had said the break­down on Oct 14 dur­ing the evening peak hour af­fected around 123,000 com­muters – 110,000 on the North-South and East-West lines for 3½ hours, as well as 13,000 pas­sen­gers on the Cir­cle Line for just over an hour.</p>
