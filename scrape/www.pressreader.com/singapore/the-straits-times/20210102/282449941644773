    <p>•</p>
    <p>In a typ­i­cal year, New York em­ploy­ees of mag­a­zine pub­lisher Conde Nast must use their va­ca­tion days be­fore late De­cem­ber or lose them – a com­mon pol­icy across cor­po­rate Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>But early last month, the com­pany e-mailed em­ploy­ees to say they could carry up to five va­ca­tion days into the next year, an ap­par­ent ac­knowl­edge­ment that many scrimped on days off amid the long hours and travel curbs im­posed by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The carry-over will be au­to­matic, and there is noth­ing fur­ther you need to do,” the e-mail said.</p>
    <p>Conde Nast was not alone in scram­bling to make end-of-year ar­range­ments for va­ca­tion-de­prived work­ers. But some em­ploy­ers have been less ac­com­mo­dat­ing.</p>
    <p>“It’s a big is­sue we’re see­ing now – com­pet­ing re­quests for time off over the next two weeks,” said em­ploy­ment lawyer Al­lan Bloom of Proskauer in New York. “Clients are strug­gling to fig­ure it out.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bloom and other lawyers as well as hu­man re­source ex­perts in the United States said there was no clear pat­tern in how em­ploy­ers were han­dling the chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Many com­pa­nies that al­ready al­low em­ploy­ees to carry va­ca­tion days into the next year – like Gold­man Sachs and Spo­tify (gen­er­ally up to 10 days for both firms) – have not felt the need to change their poli­cies. The same is true for some com­pa­nies that pay work­ers for their unused va­ca­tion days.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther Gen­eral Mo­tors nor Ford, whose hourly work­ers can cash out unused va­ca­tion days at the end of the year, made changes last year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, many work­ers may find them­selves un­able to take va­ca­tions that they post­poned: Salaried work­ers at both au­tomak­ers or­di­nar­ily lose unused va­ca­tion days at the end of the year with­out com­pen­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Other com­pa­nies have taken steps that could defuse a po­ten­tial hu­man re­source headache and, they say, ben­e­fit their work­forces in dif­fi­cult times.</p>
    <p>Bank of Amer­ica, which nor­mally re­quires its US em­ploy­ees to take all their va­ca­tion days be­fore the end of the year, said last June that it would al­low them to push up to five days into the first quar­ter of this year.</p>
    <p>Cit­i­group has typ­i­cally al­lowed its US em­ploy­ees to carry va­ca­tion days into the first quar­ter of the next year, but it added an in­duce­ment last July: Em­ploy­ees re­ceive an ex­tra va­ca­tion day this year if they use all of their 2020 va­ca­tion time in the same year.</p>
    <p>Smaller com­pa­nies have made sim­i­lar mod­i­fi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Lat­shaw Drilling, an oil ser­vice com­pany based in Tulsa, Ok­la­homa, typ­i­cally al­lows of­fice work­ers to roll over up to three weeks of va­ca­tion time.</p>
    <p>Last month, Lat­shaw told its of­fice em­ploy­ees that it would buy up to one week of unused time be­yond that amount, which they would have other­wise lost.</p>
    <p>“Since this year was so crazy and peo­ple were afraid to travel, we made a one-time change,” said Mr Trent Lat­shaw, the com­pany’s founder and pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral ex­perts said a philo­soph­i­cal ques­tion loomed over va­ca­tion ben­e­fits: Is the point to en­sure that work­ers take time off?</p>
    <p>Or are va­ca­tion days sim­ply an al­ter­na­tive form of com­pen­sa­tion that work­ers can use as they see fit, whether to re­lax away from the job, to sup­ple­ment their in­come or to drag around with them un­til the end of time, as a mon­u­ment to their pro­duc­tiv­ity?</p>
    <p>An em­ployer’s poli­cies can re­flect its views on this ques­tion: For all their draw­backs, use-it-or-lo­seit rules can help en­sure that work­ers take time off, said Ms Jackie Rein­berg, who heads the ab­sence and dis­abil­ity prac­tice of con­sult­ing firm Wil­lis Tow­ers Wat­son. By con­trast, rollover and cash-out op­tions im­ply that va­ca­tion is an as­set they are en­ti­tled to con­trol.</p>
    <p>Still, for many work­ers, the is­sue dur­ing the pan­demic is not unused va­ca­tion days so much as in­suf­fi­cient va­ca­tion days.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral ex­perts said a philo­soph­i­cal ques­tion loomed over va­ca­tion ben­e­fits: Is the point to en­sure that work­ers take time off? Or are va­ca­tion days sim­ply an al­ter­na­tive form of com­pen­sa­tion that work­ers can use as they see fit, whether to re­lax away from the job, to sup­ple­ment their in­come or to drag around with them un­til the end of time, as a mon­u­ment to their pro­duc­tiv­ity?</p>
    <p>FI­NAN­CIAL CON­SID­ER­A­TIONS</p>
    <p>Mr Jonathan Wil­liams, com­mu­ni­ca­tions di­rec­tor for United Food and Com­mer­cial Work­ers Lo­cal 400, which rep­re­sents gro­cery store work­ers in Mid-At­lantic states, said work­ers had some­times been forced to draw down their re­serves of paid time off if they were asked to quar­an­tine a se­cond time af­ter a pos­si­ble coro­n­avirus ex­po­sure. Only the first quar­an­tine is typ­i­cally cov­ered by the em­ployer, Mr Wil­liams said.</p>
    <p>And some em­ploy­ees have dif­fi­culty tak­ing ad­van­tage of the gen­er­ous va­ca­tion poli­cies their com­pa­nies of­fer.</p>
    <p>A Tar­get spokesman said the com­pany had in­creased the va­ca­tion days that both hourly and salaried work­ers could roll over into the next year, based on the em­ployee’s role and ten­ure.</p>
    <p>But Mr Adam Ryan, who works for Tar­get in Chris­tians­burg, Vir­ginia, said many em­ploy­ees strug­gle to qual­ify for ben­e­fits like va­ca­tion days. He said in a text mes­sage that he had been with the com­pany for three years but typ­i­cally av­er­aged less than 20 hours a week.</p>
    <p>“That way I don’t get any va­ca­tion or paid sick days, no real ben­e­fits of any kind,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Tar­get spokesman said staff could pick up more hours un­der its hol­i­day staffing ar­range­ment.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral union of­fi­cials, em­ploy­ers and hu­man re­source ex­perts said fi­nan­cial con­sid­er­a­tions drove many de­ci­sions about va­ca­tion poli­cies dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Toy­ota nor­mally al­lows hourly and many salaried em­ploy­ees in the US to cash out up to two weeks of unused va­ca­tion days. Last year, the com­pany low­ered the cap to one week, a change that a spokesman said was in­tended to help avert lay­offs.</p>
    <p>The con­sid­er­a­tions be­come even more com­pli­cated for days that work­ers push into fu­ture years. Ac­cord­ing to Ms Rein­berg, al­low­ing work­ers to roll over days can cre­ate a pile of li­a­bil­i­ties owed to work­ers that many em­ploy­ers are loath to carry on their books.</p>
    <p>Mr Dan Gre­bler, a union of­fi­cial at Reuters, last month said the news or­gan­i­sa­tion cited ac­count­ing con­cerns in stick­ing with its use-it-or-lose-it pol­icy last year. The union had pleaded for le­niency, not­ing that its con­tract al­lows man­age­ment to ap­prove a rollover of va­ca­tion days in “ex­cep­tional cir­cum­stances”.</p>
    <p>“If 2020 has not been ex­cep­tional, I don’t know what the hell has been,” said Mr Gre­bler, an ed­i­tor who is chair of the work­ers’ bar­gain­ing unit at Reuters. “The re­sponse was: ‘No, we can’t do that. There would be com­pli­cated book­keep­ing in­volved.’ ”</p>
    <p>He added that Reuters had be­gun urg­ing work­ers to take days off this past cal­en­dar year around the same time it had re­buffed him.</p>
    <p>A Reuters spokesman said “our pol­icy for US em­ploy­ees for some years has not al­lowed for unused va­ca­tion days to be rolled over” and that “em­ploy­ees have been reg­u­larly re­minded since the first half of this year”.</p>
    <p>Unionised em­ploy­ees, such as re­porters, at The New York Times are en­cour­aged to use va­ca­tion days dur­ing the year in which they ac­crue the days but can gen­er­ally carry them over un­til March 1 of the next year. Days they do not use by that point are paid out in cash. A com­pany spokesman said the pol­icy re­mains un­changed.</p>
    <p>MAN­DATED LEAVE</p>
    <p>By both law and cus­tom, many Amer­i­cans have come to see va­ca­tion days more as com­pen­sa­tion than as a man­date to take time off.</p>
    <p>In a sur­vey by Wil­lis Tow­ers Wat­son last April, more than half of em­ploy­ers that made or planned to make changes to their va­ca­tion ben­e­fits said they were do­ing so be­cause they did not ex­pect work­ers to use all their days. About onethird that planned changes said the ben­e­fit had be­come too costly.</p>
    <p>A few states, like Cal­i­for­nia and Mon­tana, essen­tially cod­ify the prop­erty-right view of va­ca­tion by out­law­ing use-it-or-lose-it poli­cies. (Firms with use-it-or-lose-it or strict rollover poli­cies must ex­empt work­ers in those states.)</p>
    <p>Such laws pro­tect work­ers from be­ing de­prived of va­ca­tion days that are dif­fi­cult to use dur­ing the year only to have them ex­pire at the year end. But these laws may also sub­tly dis­cour­age va­ca­tions by mak­ing them eas­ier to re­deem for money or put off in­def­i­nitely.</p>
    <p>“To me as an ad­vo­cate, you should be able by law to keep unused va­ca­tion time,” said em­ploy­ment lawyer Peter Romer-Fried­manat Gupta Wessler. “But I’m not sure that cre­ates a good in­cen­tive.”</p>
    <p>To that end, a num­ber of com­pa­nies, many in the tech in­dus­try, have seized on the pan­demic as an op­por­tu­nity to make sure their work­ers are de­com­press­ing.</p>
    <p>Early last year, soft­ware com­pany GitLab re­sponded to a sig­nif­i­cant rise in hours put in by its more than 1,000 work­ers with so-called friends-and-fam­ily days, in which the firm shuts down to dis­cour­age peo­ple from log­ging in. Google, Slack and soft­ware com­pany Cloud­era have started sim­i­lar poli­cies – none of which counts against work­ers’ paid days off.</p>
    <p>Au­tomat­tic, the maker of web­site build­ing tool Word­Press.com, has gone even fur­ther, en­cour­ag­ing em­ploy­ees who work to­gether to co­or­di­nate their va­ca­tions as a way to elim­i­nate fric­tion that dis­cour­ages breaks.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been ex­per­i­ment­ing with en­tire teams tak­ing time off si­mul­ta­ne­ously,” said Ms Lori McLeese, the firm’s head of hu­man re­sources. “We’re hop­ing that this may re­duce the amount of ‘catchup’ work em­ploy­ees typ­i­cally re­turn to af­ter tak­ing a va­ca­tion, mak­ing their tran­si­tion back less stress­ful or over­whelm­ing.”</p>
