    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • It was hard to tell that Hi­nako Shi­buno was in con­trol half­way through the 75th US Women’s Open on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“I feel like I’m not con­fi­dent at all,” the Ja­panese said. “I feel like I am not my­self.”</p>
    <p>The 22-year-old’s re­sults and game told a dif­fer­ent story. Her four-un­der 67 at Cham­pi­ons Golf Club in Hous­ton gave her a to­tal of seven-un­der 135, good for a three-stroke lead over Swedish am­a­teur Linn Grant (69).</p>
    <p>Shi­buno, last year’s Bri­tish Open cham­pion, made four birdies on the back nine, re­cov­er­ing from two bo­geys on the Jackrab­bit course, one of two lay­outs used due to di­min­ished day­light hours.</p>
    <p>“To­day my tee shots found the rough more of­ten. How­ever, my sec­ond shots were pretty sta­ble and (I was able to make pars),” said the Okayama na­tive, who won four times last year on the Ja­pan LPGA Tour. “My golf to­day was pretty safe, sta­ble con­di­tion. At the same time, when it comes to the chance for a birdie, my putting was good.”</p>
    <p>Grant, one of six am­a­teurs to make the cut at the year’s fi­nal Ma­jor, cred­its her fa­ther – a for­mer col­lege player-turned-in­struc­tor who is cad­dy­ing for her this week – with help­ing her de­velop her short game.</p>
    <p>“He keeps me calm on the golf course,” the 21-year-old said. “We know how we work to­gether. So right now he’s just se­cu­rity.”</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can Amy Ol­son ceded her first-round lead af­ter a trio of bo­geys and a dou­ble-bo­gey saw her card a one-over 72, fin­ish­ing her round tied for third with com­pa­tri­ots Kait­lyn Papp (68) and Me­gan Khang (69).</p>
    <p>Two-time Ma­jor win­ner Cristie Kerr en­joyed a bo­gey-free twounder 69 at Cy­press Creek de­spite play­ing through pain from a re­cent golf cart col­li­sion that left her with dis­lo­cated ribs.</p>
    <p>“I played just pretty solid golf un­til the last five holes when my rib and my lat and ev­ery­thing back here just started re­ally killing me,” said the Amer­i­can, who was tied for sixth (140).</p>
    <p>World No. 2 Kim Sei-young was in a pack shar­ing 14th on 141 af­ter a 69 while fel­low South Korean, the top-ranked Ko Jin-young (70), shared 29th on 143.</p>
