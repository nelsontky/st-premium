    <p>All Blacks coach Ian Foster has urged his team to play “smarter”, claim­ing they were “pro­voked” into los­ing their dis­ci­pline by a nig­gly Wal­la­bies side dur­ing the loss in Bris­bane.</p>
    <p>Foster tasted a bit­ter first de­feat as All Blacks boss after his reshuf­fled side fell 24-22 in Satur­day’s af­fair at Lang Park, which fea­tured two red and yel­low cards each.</p>
    <p>New Zealand had won their 18th straight Bledis­loe Cup a week ear­lier fol­low­ing their record 43-5 win over Aus­tralia in Syd­ney, so Lang Park was but a dead-rub­ber Test. But it was far from low key on the pitch as the All Blacks were pun­ished se­verely for their indis­ci­pline in the sec­ond half.</p>
    <p>Wal­la­bies fly­half Reece Hodge slot­ted three penal­ties and prop Taniela Tupou scored the de­ci­sive try while Scott Bar­rett was sin­binned for draw­ing yel­low in the 68th minute.</p>
    <p>“In the sec­ond half, we weren’t as dis­ci­plined as we needed to be,” Foster told re­porters yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We were be­ing pushed in the ar­eas and pro­voked in the ar­eas, and again that’s a tac­tic that teams use against us, and good on them.</p>
    <p>“We’ve got to be bet­ter than that and smarter than that.”</p>
    <p>The red cards that hit both teams for head-high tack­les drew heated de­bate, with for­mer All Blacks great John Kir­wan say­ing the whole red card sys­tem should be scrapped be­cause it pun­ishes teams too se­verely and can end up killing off a con­test.</p>
    <p>“I get that ar­gu­ment to one ex­tent,” he said. “But the flip side of it is it’s a very phys­i­cal game, and if we don’t have clear bound­aries, it be­comes re­ally hard for ev­ery­one to play the skil­ful game they need to.”</p>
    <p>The red cards were in line with World Rugby’s crack­down on con­tact with the head, which makes no al­lowance for ac­ci­den­tal col­li­sion.</p>
    <p>The All Blacks have notched two wins, a loss and a draw against the Wal­la­bies in Foster’s first four matches in charge. They will con­tinue their bid for the Tri-Na­tions sil­ver­ware against Ar­gentina in Syd­ney on Satur­day.</p>
