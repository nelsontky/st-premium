    <p>Should rules on noise lev­els be re­viewed?</p>
    <p>I think the cur­rent rules are good enough. This is our heart­land HDB; it’s a Sin­ga­porean cul­ture to make some noise dur­ing some oc­ca­sions. Please re­mem­ber this is public hous­ing.</p>
    <p>Alex Ong</p>
    <p>The rules def­i­nitely need a change, es­pe­cially with front-line work­ers like nurses, doctors, po­lice, am­bu­lance staff, and other staff work­ing ro­tat­ing and night shifts. It could be dan­ger­ous if they can­not sleep dur­ing the day and go back to work to look af­ter sick pa­tients as they would be too tired.</p>
    <p>Swee Png</p>
    <p>Some cars and mo­tor­cy­cles are ex­cep­tion­ally noisy. Some of these folk de­lib­er­ately rev their en­gines in the dead of the night. More must be done to give res­i­dents their well-de­served rest.</p>
    <p>Barry Koh</p>
    <p>The cur­rent reg­u­la­tions on noise are fair and ap­pro­pri­ate.</p>
    <p>Wed­ding “games” and re­li­gious events are not daily hap­pen­ings.</p>
    <p>This is heart­land com­mu­nity liv­ing. Sounds are nor­mal.</p>
    <p>Sp Fair­ley</p>
    <p>If that were the case, then all re­pair, main­te­nance, build­ing, up­grad­ing works can­not be car­ried out.</p>
    <p>Idris Md Noor</p>
    <p>I’m more con­cerned about the fre­quent air­craft noise when we work from home.</p>
    <p>Norfa Ta­jud­din</p>
    <p>What kind of guide­lines on the eth­i­cal use of in­tru­sive tech­nol­ogy are needed?</p>
    <p>It’s quite laugh­able be­cause CCTV and sur­veil­lance tech­nol­ogy, as well as ERP and li­cence plate recog­ni­tion tech­nol­ogy, have been around for many years. How else do you think the po­lice can track down crim­i­nals and of­fend­ers?</p>
    <p>Any­one de­ter­mined enough and who in­tends to cir­cum­vent or de­feat these sys­tems can do so. For the nor­mal crim­i­nal and man in the street, the Pro­tec­tion from Ha­rass­ment Act and Com­puter Mis­use Act are more than ad­e­quate to cur­tail their be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>But no amount of leg­is­la­tion is go­ing to stop ne­far­i­ous acts com­mit­ted by the Deep State or those from the Dark Web. Cle­ment Chan</p>
    <p>Here’s an ex­am­ple of a sim­ple frame­work:</p>
    <p>• Re­move all po­lice cam­eras from all HDB flats.</p>
    <p>• All CCTV cam­eras should not be al­lowed to have fa­cial recog­ni­tion ca­pa­bil­i­ties. Only ar­eas with the high­est se­cu­rity re­quire­ments like top se­cret military in­stal­la­tions should be al­lowed to have fa­cial recog­ni­tion – for ac­cess but not as se­cu­rity cam­eras. This means no fa­cial recog­ni­tion gantries at our im­mi­gra­tion check­points.</p>
    <p>• Fa­cial recog­ni­tion tech­nol­ogy can­not be used to iden­tify peo­ple un­less granted by a court or­der, for which ap­proval has to be doc­u­mented and fre­quently au­dited.</p>
    <p>• No track­ing or trac­ing of any­one un­less granted by court or­der as well.</p>
    <p>• The Gov­ern­ment should not use ex­ter­nal par­ties’ data, like from game sites or other web­sites, to track peo­ple.</p>
