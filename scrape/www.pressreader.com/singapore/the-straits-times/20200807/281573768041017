    <p>Sin­ga­pore swim­ming is on the right track to achieve its “long-haul” tar­gets, says Mr Lee Kok Choy, af­ter be­ing elected un­op­posed for his fourth and fi­nal two-year term as the as­so­ci­a­tion’s pres­i­dent. The tar­gets in­clude an Olympic re­lay medal, more ath­letes qual­i­fy­ing for the Games, reach­ing fi­nals and fight­ing for podium fin­ishes.</p>
    <p>An Olympics swim­ming re­lay medal is a “long-haul” tar­get, but Sin­ga­pore Swim­ming As­so­ci­a­tion (SSA) pres­i­dent Lee Kok Choy be­lieves the as­so­ci­a­tion is mov­ing in the right di­rec­tion to achiev­ing this goal, along with hit­ting other mile­stones.</p>
    <p>These break­throughs in­clude hav­ing more ath­letes qual­ify for the Olympics, reach­ing the fi­nals, and con­tend­ing for podium fin­ishes.</p>
    <p>“It’s go­ing to be a good chal­lenge and I be­lieve we are on track. We are mak­ing good progress ev­ery year, mak­ing break­throughs on in­fras­truc­ture, ca­pa­bil­ity and im­prov­ing the skills of peo­ple in­volved,”</p>
    <p>Lee, 67, told The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“There are no time­lines. This is a jour­ney in which you can’t set times on when you would want (re­sults).</p>
    <p>“Re­al­is­ti­cally there is progress ev­ery time we hit a ma­jor meet and if we set our own per­sonal bests along the way and keep im­prov­ing our­selves, we’ll find our­selves among the best in the world.”</p>
    <p>Lee, who had led the sport since 2014, will re­turn un­op­posed for his fourth and fi­nal two-year term at the SSA’s an­nual gen­eral meet­ing on Aug 20. This fol­lows the clos­ing of nom­i­na­tions on Wed­nes­day, with no con­tests for all 10 po­si­tions in the SSA ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>The na­tional re­lay teams have been con­sis­tently low­er­ing na­tional records in re­cent times. At last year’s World Cham­pi­onships in Gwangju, they set four na­tional records, of which two were low­ered five months later at the SEA Games.</p>
    <p>The 4x200m freestyle quar­tet of Quah Ting Wen, Gan Ching Hwee, Christie Chue and Quah Jing Wen also came close to se­cur­ing the Repub­lic’s first Olympic re­lay spot since 1996, as they were 0.06sec be­hind the 12th-placed hosts at the world meet in South Korea.</p>
    <p>The top 12 teams in each re­lay event earned their tick­ets to Tokyo. The re­main­ing four Olympic berths will go to the four fastest teams in Fina-ap­proved qual­i­fy­ing events un­til May 31 next year.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Fina rank­ings for 2019, the Sin­ga­pore women’s 4x100m and 4x200m freestyle re­lay teams are 15th and 16th in the world re­spec­tively. Their male coun­ter­parts are ranked 19th in the 4x100m free and 22nd in the 4x200m free.</p>
    <p>While Lee noted his team has built high per­for­mance ca­pa­bil­i­ties in the aquatics dis­ci­plines (swim­ming, div­ing, artis­tic swim­ming and wa­ter polo), he stressed that it is im­por­tant to con­tinue mak­ing progress, while in­creas­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for par­tic­i­pa­tion.</p>
    <p>The sport’s suc­cess has been marked by Joseph School­ing clinch­ing Sin­ga­pore’s first Olympic ti­tle in 2016 and, more re­cently, its swim­mers equalling their best-ever SEA Games haul of 23 golds last year in the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>Lee also high­lighted diver Jonathan Chan’s qual­i­fi­ca­tion for next year’s Olympics – a first for Sin­ga­pore – and the artis­tic swim­mers’ dom­i­nance in South-east Asia as signs of im­prove­ment.</p>
    <p>He added: “We want to be able to de­liver a full aquatic sports plan that cov­ers ev­ery­thing from learnto-swim to im­prov­ing our per­for­mance at the Olympics.”</p>
    <p>His team in­cludes three new faces – Der­rick Lim, Lee Thin Cheong and Wendy Lim – who will as­sume the po­si­tions of trea­surer, as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral (wa­ter polo) and vice-pres­i­dent (div­ing) re­spec­tively. They re­place Tan Yew Khuan, Ang Ban Leong and Wil­liam Lee.</p>
    <p>The SSA’s con­sti­tu­tion man­dates that the max­i­mum ac­cu­mu­la­tive ten­ure a per­son can serve as pres­i­dent is eight years. Lee said: “If we con­tinue to im­prove from where we are by the time I’m fin­ished, I would say I’m sat­is­fied...</p>
    <p>“I don’t want to let us be mea­sured by how many medals we win, I’d rather we con­tinue to make progress on the level of par­tic­i­pa­tion and per­for­mance in terms of tim­ings and scores, and how we im­prove our busi­ness model.”</p>
    <p>IM­PROV­ING YEAR ON YEAR</p>
    <p>It’s go­ing to be a good chal­lenge and I be­lieve we are on track. We are mak­ing good progress ev­ery year, mak­ing break­throughs on in­fras­truc­ture, ca­pa­bil­ity and im­prov­ing the skills of peo­ple in­volved. ’’</p>
