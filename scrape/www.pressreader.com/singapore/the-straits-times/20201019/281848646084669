    <p>LON­DON • The door is still ajar for Bri­tain and the Euro­pean Union to strike a post-Brexit trade deal but the bloc needs to change its ap­proach and show it is se­ri­ous be­fore talks can re­sume this week, se­nior Bri­tish min­is­ter Michael Gove said.</p>
    <p>The bloc had squan­dered some of the progress made in ne­go­ti­a­tions be­cause it had not been will­ing to in­ten­sify talks or pro­duce de­tailed le­gal texts, Mr Gove said.</p>
    <p>“We hope that the EU will change their po­si­tion; we’re cer­tainly not say­ing if they do change their po­si­tion that we can’t talk to them,” he told the BBC yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The lat­est talks broke down last Thurs­day when the EU said Bri­tain needed to give ground. Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son hit back the next day, telling Brussels there was no point in con­tin­u­ing the ne­go­ti­a­tions un­less the EU fun­da­men­tally changed course, and telling busi­nesses to pre­pare for no deal. Euro­pean lead­ers, how­ever, have tasked ne­go­tia­tor Michel Barnier to con­tinue talks.</p>
    <p>French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron said there were no di­vi­sions in the bloc. “We are ready for a deal, but not at any price,” he said last Fri­day. Is­sues still to be re­solved in­clude fair com­pe­ti­tion rules, dis­pute res­o­lu­tion and fish­eries.</p>
    <p>Asked by Sky News if Mr Barnier should come to Lon­don this week, as pre­vi­ously planned, Mr Gove said the “ball was in his court”.</p>
    <p>“We made clear we needed to see a change in ap­proach from the Euro­pean Union,” he said, adding that Mr Barnier would be speak­ing to his Bri­tish coun­ter­part David Frost in the com­ing days.</p>
    <p>“Let’s see if the Euro­pean Union ap­pre­ci­ate the im­por­tance of reach­ing a deal and the im­por­tance of mov­ing ground.”</p>
    <p>A “no deal” fi­nale to Bri­tain’s fiveyear Brexit cri­sis would dis­rupt the sup­ply chains that stretch across Bri­tain, the EU and be­yond – just as the eco­nomic hit from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic wors­ens.</p>
    <p>“It is not my pre­ferred des­ti­na­tion,” Mr Gove said in an opin­ion piece in Bri­tain’s The Sun­day Times. “But if the choice is be­tween ar­range­ments that tie our hands in­def­i­nitely, or where we can shape our own fu­ture, then that’s no choice at all. And leav­ing on Aus­tralian terms is an out­come for which we are in­creas­ingly well pre­pared.”</p>
    <p>Mr John­son had said on Fri­day that Bri­tain should get ready for a deal with the EU sim­i­lar to the one Aus­tralia has, “based on sim­ple prin­ci­ples of global free trade”.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son’s crit­ics said that an Aus­tralian deal is sim­ply code for no deal at all with Bri­tain’s largest ex­port mar­ket.</p>
    <p>More than 70 Bri­tish busi­ness groups rep­re­sent­ing over seven mil­lion work­ers yes­ter­day urged politi­cians to get back to the ne­go­ti­at­ing ta­ble this week and strike a Brexit deal.</p>
    <p>The groups ranged from the Con­fed­er­a­tion of Bri­tish In­dus­try, TheCi­tyUK and techUK to the Na­tional Farm­ers’ Union, Bri­tish Re­tail Con­sor­tium and the So­ci­ety of Mo­tor Man­u­fac­tur­ers and Traders.</p>
    <p>“With com­pro­mise and tenac­ity, a deal can be done. Busi­nesses call on lead­ers on both sides to find a route through,” they said.</p>
