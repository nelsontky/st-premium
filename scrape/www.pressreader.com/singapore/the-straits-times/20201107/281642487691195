    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Philadel­phia po­lice are in­ves­ti­gat­ing an al­leged plot to at­tack the city’s Penn­syl­va­nia Con­ven­tion Cen­tre, where votes from the hotly con­tested United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion are be­ing counted.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal po­lice re­ceived a tip about a Hum­mer with armed peo­ple driv­ing up from Vir­ginia with plans to at­tack the con­ven­tion cen­tre, a po­lice rep­re­sen­ta­tive said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Po­lice ar­rested one man and seized a weapon as well as the Hum­mer about which they had re­ceived a tip. No in­juries were re­ported and no fur­ther de­tails about the al­leged plot were dis­closed.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier on Thurs­day, sup­port­ers of both US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and his Demo­cratic chal­lenger Joe Bi­den held ral­lies in Philadel­phia as elec­tion staff slowly counted thou­sands of mailin bal­lots that could de­cide Penn­syl­va­nia’s cru­cial 20 Elec­toral Col­lege votes.</p>
    <p>Trump ac­tivists waved flags and car­ried signs say­ing “Vote stops on elec­tion day” and “Sorry, polls are closed”, as Bi­den sup­port­ers danced to mu­sic be­hind a bar­ri­cade across the street ear­lier in the day.</p>
    <p>“We can’t al­low the bal­lot coun­ters to be in­tim­i­dated,” said re­tired so­cial worker Bob Po­suney, a 70-year-old Bi­den sup­porter wear­ing a “Count ev­ery vote” T-shirt as Marvin Gaye’s What’s Go­ing On filled the air.</p>
    <p>The US Postal Ser­vice said about 1,700 bal­lots had been iden­ti­fied in Penn­syl­va­nia at pro­cess­ing fa­cil­i­ties dur­ing two sweeps late on Thurs­day and were be­ing de­liv­ered to elec­tion of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has said re­peat­edly with­out ev­i­dence that mail-in votes are prone to fraud, al­though elec­tion ex­perts say that is rare in US elec­tions.</p>
    <p>Sup­port­ers of Mr Trump, some car­ry­ing guns, ramped up demon­stra­tions on Thurs­day night, against what the Pres­i­dent has base­lessly called a rigged elec­tion, in bat­tle­ground states where votes were be­ing counted.</p>
    <p>The demon­stra­tions were largely peace­ful, al­though Trump sup­port­ers oc­ca­sion­ally shouted at counter-protesters.</p>
    <p>In Ari­zona, one of the closely con­tested states in the too-close-to­call race be­tween Mr Trump and Mr Bi­den, sup­port­ers of both sides briefly scuf­fled out­side the Mari­copa County Elec­tions De­part­ment in Phoenix.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral heav­ily armed rightwing groups as­sem­bled on the site as elec­tion work­ers counted votes in­side, but the protests re­mained mostly peace­ful de­spite mount­ing ten­sion.</p>
    <p>Apart from the al­leged at­tack plot, the scene in Philadel­phia was less con­fronta­tional, where proTrump and pro-Bi­den demon­stra­tors were sep­a­rated by waist-high por­ta­ble bar­ri­ers un­der a strong po­lice pres­ence.</p>
    <p>With the fu­ture of the pres­i­dency in the bal­ance, restive en­coun­ters also un­folded in New York and Wash­ing­ton, as well as swing-state cities such as Mil­wau­kee, Wis­con­sin; Las Ve­gas, Ne­vada; Detroit, Michi­gan; and At­lanta, Ge­or­gia.</p>
    <p>On the In­ter­net, Face­book re­moved a fast-grow­ing group in which Trump sup­port­ers posted vi­o­lent rhetoric, as the so­cial me­dia gi­ant and other so­cial me­dia or­gan­i­sa­tions tack­led base­less claims and po­ten­tial vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>In Phoenix, Trump sup­port­ers</p>
    <p>briefly chased a man who held up a sign de­pict­ing the Pres­i­dent as a Nazi pig be­hind a stage where right-wing con­spir­acy the­o­rist Alex Jones was speak­ing.</p>
    <p>Po­lice in­ter­vened and broke up the al­ter­ca­tion af­ter the man and his small group of counter-demon­stra­tors were sur­rounded by Trump ac­tivists.</p>
    <p>“They are try­ing to steal the elec­tion, but Amer­ica knows what hap­pened and it is fight­ing back,” Mr Jones told the crowd of about 300 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>In Mil­wau­kee, about 50 Trump sup­port­ers gath­ered for a “Stop the Steal” rally in front of a city build­ing where votes were be­ing counted, blast­ing coun­try mu­sic, wav­ing flags and car­ry­ing signs read­ing “Re­count” and “Rigged”. At least one man had a gun in his hol­ster.</p>
    <p>Roughly a dozen coun­ter­protesters ar­rived later, shout­ing</p>
    <p>“Black lives mat­ter” and “Say their names”, re­fer­ring to vic­tims of po­lice bru­tal­ity. Oth­ers threw eggs at the Trump sup­port­ers from a pass­ing car.</p>
    <p>“My coun­try’s fu­ture is what brings me out here tonight,” said Mr Mitchell Land­graf, a 21-yearold con­struc­tion worker who cast his first vote in a pres­i­den­tial elec­tion for Mr Trump. “I am afraid if it goes one way, this coun­try will go down­hill fast.”</p>
