    <p>From to­day, Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents (PRs) who are al­lowed to travel over­seas un­der per­mit­ted ar­range­ments and sub­se­quently de­velop Covid-19 can tap gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies, MediShield Life and In­te­grated Shield Plans (IPs) for their hos­pi­tal treat­ment.</p>
    <p>These trav­ellers can turn to these schemes should symp­toms ap­pear within 14 days of their re­turn to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>But they have to pay out of their own pocket any re­main­ing co-pay­ment amounts.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, long-term pass hold­ers who travel un­der per­mit­ted ar­range­ments can tap schemes like for­eign worker in­sur­ance for their treat­ment.</p>
    <p>Per­mit­ted travel ar­range­ments in­clude the bi­lat­eral ones with Malaysia and China, and any other that may be im­ple­mented in the fu­ture. Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong an­nounced the change at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has been foot­ing the in­pa­tient med­i­cal bills for Sin­ga­pore­ans, PRs and long-term pass hold­ers who are treated for Covid-19 at pub­lic health­care in­sti­tu­tions. It does not do so for in­di­vid­u­als who breach travel ad­vi­sories.</p>
    <p>Since March 27, Sin­ga­pore­ans, PRs and long-term pass hold­ers who travel over­seas have had to pay for their own in­pa­tient med­i­cal bills in full if they have symp­toms within 14 days of re­turn­ing here.</p>
    <p>They also could not claim from MediShield Life or IPs in pub­lic and pri­vate hospi­tals.</p>
    <p>But as the Gov­ern­ment grad­u­ally re­opens its bor­ders, it will let Sin­ga­pore­ans, PRs and long-term pass hold­ers trav­el­ling un­der per­mit­ted ar­range­ments to tap ex­ist­ing fi­nan­cial schemes from to­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan added: “Those who are not un­der per­mit­ted travel ar­range­ments and in­stead travel in breach of the travel ad­vi­sories will con­tinue to pay for their Covid-19 in­pa­tient med­i­cal bills in full.”</p>
    <p>He also said short-term pass hold­ers en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore un­der the per­mit­ted travel ar­range­ments will have to bear the cost of their med­i­cal bills, should they test pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus within 14 days of ar­rival here.</p>
    <p>PAY­ING BILLS IN FULL</p>
    <p>Those who are not un­der per­mit­ted travel ar­range­ments and in­stead travel in breach of the travel ad­vi­sories will con­tinue to pay for their Covid-19 in­pa­tient med­i­cal bills in full. ’’</p>
