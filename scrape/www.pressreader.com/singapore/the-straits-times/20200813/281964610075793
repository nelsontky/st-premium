    <p>NAIROBI/PORT LOUIS • Mau­ri­tian vol­un­teers fished dead eels from oily wa­ters this week as they tried to clean up dam­age to the In­dian Ocean is­land’s most pris­tine beaches af­ter a Ja­panese bulk car­rier leaked an es­ti­mated 1,000 tonnes of oil.</p>
    <p>The ship, MV Wakashio, owned by Na­gashiki Ship­ping and op­er­ated by Mit­sui OSK Lines, struck a coral reef on Mau­ri­tius’ south-east coast on July 25 and be­gan leak­ing oil last week, rais­ing fears of a ma­jor eco­log­i­cal cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Ac­tivists told Reuters on Tues­day that dead eels were float­ing in the wa­ter and dead starfish were marked by the sticky black liq­uid.</p>
    <p>Crabs and seabirds are also dy­ing.</p>
    <p>“We don’t know what may hap­pen fur­ther with the boat, it may crack more,” said clean-up vol­un­teer Yvan Luck­hun.</p>
    <p>The ship, which is still hold­ing some 2,000 tonnes of oil, is ex­pected to break up, Prime Min­is­ter Pravind Jug­nauth said late on Mon­day, warn­ing that the coun­try must pre­pare for the worst.</p>
    <p>Tourism is a lead­ing part of the Mau­ri­tius econ­omy. The govern­ment, which de­clared an emer­gency last Fri­day due to the spill, is work­ing with for­mer colo­nial ruler</p>
    <p>France to try to re­move the oil.</p>
    <p>The spill has set back t wo decades worth of restor­ing the nat­u­ral wildlife and plants in the la­goon, which started af­ter the govern­ment banned sand har­vest­ing in the area in 2000, said Mr Vikash Tatayah, con­ser­va­tion di­rec­tor at Mau­ri­tius Wildlife Foun­da­tion, a non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The frag­men­ta­tion of the oil in the sea is ex­pected to dam­age corals when the heav­ier par­ti­cles in the oil set­tle on them, he said, adding that the steps taken by the govern­ment to pre­vent the dis­as­ter are also be­ing scru­ti­nised.</p>
    <p>“There is some anger and some crit­i­cism from the civil so­ci­ety that the govern­ment may have taken too much time to re­spond,” Mr Tatayah said.</p>
    <p>The ship had been grounded for nearly two weeks be­fore it started leak­ing oil. There was no im­me­di­ate com­ment from Mau­ri­tian govern­ment of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>The Wakashio passed an an­nual in­spec­tion in March with­out any prob­lems, Ja­pan’s ClassNK in­spec­tion body said.</p>
    <p>Mit­sui OSK Lines said in a state­ment: “We will do our ut­most to­wards re­solv­ing the sit­u­a­tion quickly.” It did not pro­vide de­tails.</p>
    <p>The com­pany said it has sent six em­ploy­ees to the site and was con­sid­er­ing send­ing more, along with trans­port sup­plies.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Mar­itime Or­gan­i­sa­tion said it had joined ef­forts to tackle the spill by pro­vid­ing tech­ni­cal ad­vice and co­or­di­nat­ing the re­sponse. UN agen­cies and other world groups were also mo­bil­is­ing en­vi­ron­men­tal and oil spill ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mau­ri­tius is seek­ing com­pen­sa­tion from the own­ers of the cargo car­rier.</p>
    <p>Mau­ri­tius now faces wide­spread pol­lu­tion, threat­en­ing the liveli­hoods of com­mu­ni­ties that de­pend on the ocean.</p>
    <p>The is­land econ­omy, which re­lies on tourists who flock to its white­sand beaches, is al­ready reel­ing from the coro­n­avirus fall­out and may be fur­ther af­fected by the spill.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment “will en­sure that the in­surance com­pany of MV Wakashio com­pen­sates the state and any other en­tity or per­son af­fected by the calamity,” Mr Jug­nauth told Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of Mau­ri­tians are help­ing to clean up the spill and pre­vent the oil from spread­ing fur­ther. And crews could fin­ish pump­ing the re­main­ing oil from the ves­sel yes­ter­day, the marine re­sources min­istry has said.</p>
