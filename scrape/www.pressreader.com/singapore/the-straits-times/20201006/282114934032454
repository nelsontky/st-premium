    <p>A Gov­ern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee (GPC) has called for a ban on res­i­dents smok­ing at win­dows or bal­conies of their homes, to lessen the ef­fects of sec­ond-hand smoke on neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>Mr Louis Ng, chair­man of the GPC for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment, said 383 peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore died due to sec­ond-hand smoke in 2016. “That is about one per­son dy­ing ev­ery day. We must do some­thing,” he said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing dur­ing an ad­journ­ment mo­tion in Par­lia­ment, he said the GPC sup­ports such a ban on res­i­dents in Hous­ing Board flats and pri­vate homes. The mo­tion lets MPs speak on a sub­ject for 20 minutes at the end of the sit­ting.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said res­i­dents, in­clud­ing a mother whose baby has a lung in­fec­tion, have raised the is­sue. Her neigh­bour smokes at mid­night, and the smoke drifts into the room where she and the baby sleep.</p>
    <p>An­other res­i­dent wakes up in the mid­dle of the night to close the win­dows so her el­derly par­ents do not in­hale sec­ond-hand smoke.</p>
    <p>The is­sue has per­sisted over the years and be­come worse, Mr Ng said.</p>
    <p>In the first four months of this year, the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) re­ceived 11,400 com­plaints re­lated to smok­ing, a 20 per cent in­crease from last year, he said. The rise was mostly due to peo­ple smok­ing in or near homes.</p>
    <p>With more peo­ple work­ing from home, the num­ber of cig­a­rette-smoke dis­putes taken to the Com­mu­nity Me­di­a­tion Cen­tre has quadru­pled, from two cases a month to eight cases, he said.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents have tried ask­ing the au­thor­i­ties for help and seek­ing me­di­a­tion, but have found such chan­nels in­ef­fec­tive, Mr Ng added. “Even when MPs want to help, they can­not seek help from law en­force­ment be­cause there is no rel­e­vant law or reg­u­la­tion to en­force.”</p>
    <p>The GPC’s pro­posed ban will em­power NEA of­fi­cers to en­force what is now an ad­vi­sory for res­i­dents, he added.</p>
    <p>While this might be seen as in­tru­sive, there are al­ready laws that curb peo­ple’s be­hav­iour at home, like the law against nu­dity at home if oth­ers can see it, Mr Ng said.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Senior Min­is­ter of State for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Amy Khor said such leg­is­la­tion would be “highly in­tru­sive” and there would be sig­nif­i­cant prac­ti­cal chal­lenges in en­force­ment.</p>
    <p>“This will ex­ac­er­bate ex­ist­ing con­cerns about pri­vacy and in­fring­ing the owner’s rights to his or her own pri­vate space,” she said.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the min­istry will adopt a three-pronged ap­proach – first, work to en­trench new so­cial norms and greater so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, it will look at more ways to fa­cil­i­tate con­ver­sa­tions be­tween neigh­bours when deal­ing with dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tions. Third, it will work with agen­cies to study how such dis­putes can be bet­ter ad­dressed by the in­ter-agency com­mu­nity dis­pute man­age­ment frame­work as well as re­view the com­mu­nity me­di­a­tion process, said Dr Khor.</p>
    <p>She added that of the 11,400 com­plaints linked to smok­ing in the first four months of this year, 58 per cent were in res­i­den­tial es­tates. Of these, 95 per cent were re­lated to smok­ing in com­mon ar­eas such as stair­cases and cor­ri­dors. Only 5 per cent in­volved smok­ing in homes.</p>
    <p>NEA has pri­ori­tised sur­veil­lance in com­mon ar­eas and de­ployed ther­mal cam­eras at smok­ing hot spots. In the first half of this year, it took 2,400 en­force­ment ac­tions in these ar­eas – a 37 per cent in­crease from the same pe­riod last year.</p>
