    <p>The mem­ory of our na­tional past, in­clud­ing the Bri­tish coloni­sa­tion and Ja­panese Oc­cu­pa­tion, makes us who we are... We must do all we can to en­sure we do not for­get.</p>
    <p>It was 75 years ago yes­ter­day that Sin­ga­pore ush­ered in the post-World War II era, start­ing a process which would see it gain in­de­pen­dence 20 years later.</p>
    <p>On Sept 12, 1945, thou­sands gath­ered to hiss at the Ja­panese around the Mu­nic­i­pal Build­ing of Sin­ga­pore – now known as City Hall.</p>
    <p>Gen­eral Seishiro Ita­gaki of Ja­pan signed 11 copies of the In­stru­ment of Sur­ren­der that day, mark­ing the end of nearly four years of the Ja­panese Oc­cu­pa­tion of South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>An eye­wit­ness ac­count i n The Straits Times on Sept 13 ob­served that the Ja­panese del­e­gates at the sur­ren­der cer­e­mony were “im­mo­bile, ex­cept (for) one who twid­dles his thumbs and twitches his feet”.</p>
    <p>It fur­ther noted that the Ja­panese rep­re­sen­ta­tives were bare­headed, per­haps re­cently shaven. “The lights glint on bald pates,” it said.</p>
    <p>The time of Gen Ita­gaki’s sig­na­ture: 11.10am. Nine min­utes later, the Ja­panese stood, bowed and shuf­fled out to “jeers and cat­calls” from the crowd.</p>
    <p>Per­haps in­tox­i­cated by the mo­ment, the jour­nal­ist wrote: “All Sin­ga­pore turned out to see the pageantry.”</p>
    <p>Th­ese days, how­ever, the oc­ca­sion is hardly re­mem­bered, much less com­mem­o­rated en­thu­si­as­ti­cally.</p>
    <p>Checks with the Na­tional Li­brary Board, the Na­tional Her­itage Board and the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces Vet­er­ans’ League (SAFVL) show no events have been planned, in part be­cause of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>While the SAFVL or­gan­ises a me­mo­rial and school trips on Feb 15 each year – when the Bri­tish sur­ren­dered Sin­ga­pore in 1942 – it said Sept 12 is sig­nif­i­cant but not as “compelling to il­lus­trate the na­tional val­ues we wish to in­stil in our chil­dren”.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Mu­seum of Sin­ga­pore is hold­ing a talk in com­mem­o­ra­tion of the end of WWII only on Sept 28.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Covid-19 led to the can­cel­la­tion of a cer­e­mony orig­i­nally planned to take place at the Kranji War Ceme­tery, leav­ing rep­re­sen­ta­tives, in­clud­ing high com­mis­sion­ers and am­bas­sadors from seven for­mer com­bat­ant na­tions – Aus­tralia, Canada, In­dia, Ja­pan, New Zealand, Bri­tain and Sin­ga­pore – to sep­a­rately lay wreaths at the Ceno­taph yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents of The Ja­panese School Sin­ga­pore also made 2,000 tsuru, or paper cranes, to sym­bol­ise peace and rec­on­cil­i­a­tion.</p>
    <p>In part, the lack of lo­cally or­gan­ised events re­flects how Sept 12 con­tin­ues to be a hard date to pin down when it comes to what it means for Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>It is in­dis­putable that res­i­dents re­ceived a re­prieve with the de­par­ture of the Ja­panese, whose vi­o­lent reign in­cluded cam­paigns such as Sook Ching, which killed 40,000 to 50,000 Chi­nese in Sin­ga­pore and Malaya.</p>
    <p>But the years when Sin­ga­pore­ans could de­cide their own fate were still to come.</p>
    <p>It was “Rule Bri­tan­nia” which sounded at the 1945 cer­e­mony, and the Union Jack that was hoisted.</p>
    <p>Peace was also only slowly re-es­tab­lished and scarcity con­tin­ued.</p>
    <p>It was nei­ther a trough or a crest of Sin­ga­pore’s his­tory.</p>
    <p>NOT END OF HARD­SHIP</p>
    <p>On what Sept 12 meant for most Sin­ga­pore­ans, his­to­rian Goh Geok Yian of the Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity (NTU) said: “It would have sig­nalled to most an ex­pec­ta­tion of es­cap­ing a par­tic­u­lar pe­riod of fear, un­cer­tain liv­ing con­di­tions and lim­ited food and re­sources, but it did not mark the end of un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>“It was def­i­nitely not the end of hard­ship as ac­cess to food, ameni­ties and cook­ing oil con­tin­ued to be lim­ited.”</p>
    <p>But it should be re­mem­bered that the de­par­ture of the Ja­panese also marked a rad­i­cal break from the past, for both Sin­ga­pore and the sur­round­ing coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The fet­ing of the Bri­tish as lib­er­a­tors dur­ing the cer­e­mony was never equated to a re­turn to pre-war Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Al­bert Lau of the de­part­ment of his­tory at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore said: “What the Ja­panese de­stroyed be­yond re­pair in those three short years was not only the once seem­ingly in­de­struc­tible myth of Bri­tish in­vin­ci­bil­ity, but also their moral right to rule Asian peo­ples.</p>
    <p>“The de­feat of the Bri­tish gave the colonised courage to be­lieve it was not hope­less to chal­lenge them.”</p>
    <p>Sept 12 ended a chap­ter of the “men­tal rev­o­lu­tion” that made na­tion­al­ists of lead­ers such as found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew, In­done­sian Pres­i­dent Sukarno and Burmese Gen­eral Aung San.</p>
    <p>Many of Sin­ga­pore’s Old Guard at­trib­uted their po­lit­i­cal awak­en­ing to their wartime ex­pe­ri­ences, said Prof Lau.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia would de­clare in­de­pen­dence in 1945, Burma would gain in­de­pen­dence in 1948, and Malaya in 1957, to name a few.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously colonised na­tions pro­gres­sively shook off their West­ern shack­les and came into their own.</p>
    <p>The age of for­mal em­pire was over. Still, for sur­vivors of the war, the power strug­gles of na­tion-states and em­pires were far from their minds.</p>
    <p>Amid patchy mem­o­ries of wartime Sin­ga­pore, it is im­pres­sions of its ex­trem­i­ties that re­main seared in their minds seven decades later.</p>
    <p>Mrs Anita de Con­ce­icao, who then lived near a prison in Malacca, was six when the war ended in 1945.</p>
    <p>Asked if her fam­ily cel­e­brated Ja­pan’s sur­ren­der, the 81-year-old sim­ply noted: “Every­body was equally poor, so there was al­most noth­ing in the pantry to bake a cake with to cel­e­brate.</p>
    <p>“All I was con­cerned about as a young child was be­ing with my par­ents.</p>
    <p>“At six years of age, one isn’t af­fected by any power change, ex­cept notic­ing per­haps the light­ness of spirit in my par­ents and neigh­bours.”</p>
    <p>Some who lived through the war have put pen to paper to doc­u­ment their lives.</p>
    <p>Mr Wil­liam Gwee Thian Hock wrote A Baba Boy­hood: Grow­ing Up Dur­ing World War 2, a 271-page ac­count of his per­spec­tive of the pe­riod.</p>
    <p>He told The New Paper in 2016 that the war led him to be­come “an avid reader of ev­ery­thing per­tain­ing to his­tor­i­cal events in gen­eral, World War II in par­tic­u­lar”.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Goh of NTU said such unique in­di­vid­ual mem­o­ries need to be pre­served, in ad­di­tion to col­lec­tive mem­o­ries stored in mu­se­ums and text­books.</p>
    <p>Al­though pri­vate mem­o­ries are more me­an­der­ing, “one should re­alise the im­por­tance in hav­ing our older gen­er­a­tions re­count the sights, the peo­ple, the smells and the feel­ings they felt”, she said.</p>
    <p>“We run a risk of mem­o­ries be­ing for­got­ten, es­pe­cially as our pi­o­neer and older gen­er­a­tions age and their in­di­vid­ual mem­o­ries fade.”</p>
    <p>AS­SO­CIATE PRO­FES­SOR AL­BERT LAU</p>
    <p>RE­LUC­TANT TO RE­CALL PAST</p>
    <p>But ef­forts to elicit mem­o­ries can be dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>Re­tired teacher Chian Yang Hui, 95, was re­luc­tant to talk about the atroc­i­ties of war as “it stirs up bad mem­o­ries”.</p>
    <p>Af­ter some per­sua­sion, how­ever, she re­called the Ja­panese sort­ing Chi­nese men in front of where she lived dur­ing the war.</p>
    <p>“Those with rougher hands were given odd jobs to do.</p>
    <p>“Those with smoother ones, which usu­ally meant they could read and write, were lined up and shot,” she said.</p>
    <p>She was near­ing 20 at the time and lamented how some men lost their lives or be­came forced labour, putting an end to bud­ding love among some of her friends and ac­quain­tances.</p>
    <p>Women also had to wear their hair short to pass off as men to avoid be­ing raped.</p>
    <p>“I hated the Ja­panese for a long time, but it’s for­given now,” she said.</p>
    <p>Madam Lim Ching, 80, was a tod­dler then.</p>
    <p>Her mother told her she laughed dur­ing the air raids when peo­ple were scram­bling for safety, as she had no con­cept of dan­ger.</p>
    <p>Her younger brother, born in 1942, is much smaller in size than her other sib­lings, she added.</p>
    <p>“It could be due to the mal­nu­tri­tion at the time. We used to mock him.”</p>
    <p>When she was three, a Ja­panese sol­dier hanged him­self from a tree in front of her, near where Thom­son Plaza is to­day. It was her first en­counter with sui­cide.</p>
    <p>“It was a long time ago, and I am quite easy­go­ing, so I want by­gones to be by­gones. But the young dy­ing is un­nat­u­ral and sad,” she added.</p>
    <p>Such ac­counts add im­por­tant com­plex­i­ties to the way Sin­ga­pore cur­rently fo­cuses on the re­silience of its peo­ple in pub­lic nar­ra­tives.</p>
    <p>Prof Goh said: “The de­ci­sion was likely made to em­pha­sise re­silience as a pos­i­tive trait, as it can be used to unify the peo­ple and build con­fi­dence, rather than a neg­a­tive ex­pe­ri­ence which fo­cuses on pain, hard­ship and hor­ror that would not lend it­self to de­vel­op­ing a com­mu­nity which can go be­yond com­mit­ting it­self to pre­vent­ing the same thing from hap­pen­ing again.”</p>
    <p>De­pend­ing on eth­nic­ity and how much ac­cess they had to re­sources, dif­fer­ent groups of peo­ple were also treated dif­fer­ently by the Ja­panese, she added, and this hetero­gene­ity should be taken into ac­count even as “the grit to sur­vive through the hard­ships and short­ages was an ex­pe­ri­ence that would have been shared by all”.</p>
    <p>Prof Lau said Sin­ga­pore does not have the “lux­ury for his­tor­i­cal am­ne­sia” as the Ja­panese Oc­cu­pa­tion con­tains im­por­tant lessons for na­tion­build­ing.</p>
    <p>He added that war is a pow­er­ful force in the forg­ing of a na­tion.</p>
    <p>Prof Lau said: “War pro­vides peo­ple with a com­mon or­deal and a shared ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>“War’s very rev­o­lu­tion­ary na­ture un­leashes forces that can be trans­for­ma­tive.</p>
    <p>“The mem­ory of our na­tional past, in­clud­ing the Bri­tish coloni­sa­tion and Ja­panese Oc­cu­pa­tion, makes us who we are... We must do all we can to en­sure we do not for­get.”</p>
