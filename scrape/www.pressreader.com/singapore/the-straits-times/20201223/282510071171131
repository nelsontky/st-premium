    <p>• Jose Mour­inho says his Tot­ten­ham side will not take sec­ond-tier Stoke for granted when they clash in to­day’s League Cup quar­ter-fi­nal.</p>
    <p>The Spurs man­ager is keen to suc­ceed where sev­eral of his pre­de­ces­sors have fallen short in de­liv­er­ing sil­ver­ware to the club for the first time since the 2008 League Cup.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he be­lieves the gap between the Premier League and the Cham­pi­onship is nar­rower than ever and sev­enth-placed Stoke will be a tricky op­po­nent to beat.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­body wants the same (to win a tro­phy),” said Mour­inho, who knows all about suc­cess in this com­pe­ti­tion hav­ing won it four times, at his vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Even the Cham­pi­onship from the last decade, the dif­fer­ence between Cham­pi­onship and Premier League is min­i­mal.</p>
    <p>NO WALK IN THE PARK</p>
    <p>“The teams are very good. They have very good play­ers and very good coaches.</p>
    <p>“So even the fact we play Stoke or that New­cas­tle play Brent­ford doesn’t give us eas­ier matches than the oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“It’s a dif­fi­cult com­pe­ti­tion to win and we need to win three matches to win it. Against teams who have the same am­bi­tions as we have. But we are go­ing in the di­rec­tion of what we are say­ing at the be­gin­ning of the sea­son.”</p>
    <p>Mour­inho, though, is mind­ful that he needs to rest some play­ers as the Stoke match will be their 25th of the sea­son, with the usual hec­tic sched­ule com­ing up over the Christ­mas pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Re­veal­ing he in­tends to ro­tate his squad at the Bri­tan­nia Sta­dium to avoid burnout, the Por­tuguese said: “I think a mix­ture. Clearly, some play­ers need to play and de­serve to play.</p>
    <p>“From the ones that are play­ing more time, there are oth­ers that we don’t have great op­tions but of course, I will try to give a lit­tle rest to two or three of them.”</p>
    <p>On the ap­palling state of Stoke’s away dress­ing room, which Mid­dles­brough boss Neil Warnock re­cently de­scribed as a “pigsty” ear­lier this month, Mour­inho did not want to get into de­tail but hinted the game’s au­thor­i­ties should look into the con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>“I was not go­ing to raise the ques­tion. You raised that ques­tion. But it should not be a ques­tion for me,” he told re­porters. “It should be a ques­tion for the au­thor­i­ties, All the au­thor­i­ties. But not for me.</p>
    <p>“I am not go­ing to be the bad guy that is go­ing to make com­ments about Stoke’s away dress­ing room.”</p>
    <p>It’s a dif­fi­cult com­pe­ti­tion to win and we need to win three matches to win it. Against teams who have the same am­bi­tions as we have.</p>
