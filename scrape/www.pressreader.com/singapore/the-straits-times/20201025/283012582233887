    <p>Fran­cois de Mari­court</p>
    <p>The Jakarta Post, In­done­sia</p>
    <p>In every cri­sis, new op­por­tu­ni­ties emerge.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pandemic has had a strong im­pact on global trade net­works and ship­ping routes, with lo­gis­tics sup­pli­ers grap­pling with dis­rup­tions and eco­nomic slow­downs.</p>
    <p>The pre-Covid-19 glob­alised world has come to a halt. The ques­tion fac­ing gov­ern­ments and cor­po­ra­tions alike is what comes next? How will global sup­ply chains shift and re­form? How can In­done­sia boost its man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­ity? How can we har­ness the po­ten­tial of the dig­i­tal rev­o­lu­tion to strengthen the econ­omy, and lastly, how can we make th­ese ad­vances sus­tain­able?</p>
    <p>Co­or­di­nat­ing Eco­nomic Min­is­ter Air­langga Har­tarto re­cently said the gov­ern­ment is work­ing hard to at­tract in­ter­na­tional in­vestors look­ing to re­lo­cate their fac­to­ries from main­land China. If suc­cess­ful, this could po­si­tion In­done­sia as a ma­jor man­u­fac­tur­ing pow­er­house.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies look­ing to di­ver­sify be­yond main­land China will need to set up a new base for their op­er­a­tions, and In­done­sia is an at­trac­tive choice. In­done­sia has sev­eral strate­gic ad­van­tages over its com­peti­tors in the re­gion. It is rich in nat­u­ral re­sources, has a large do­mes­tic mar­ket and a ready pool of pro­duc­tive work­ers.</p>
    <p>Greater adop­tion of dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies could po­ten­tially help In­done­sia at­tract greater for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment as well as move up the man­u­fac­tur­ing value chain.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia al­ready has a vibrant e-com­merce sec­tor, which last year was val­ued at US$21 billion (S$28 billion) in gross mar­ket value, mak­ing the coun­try the largest e-com­merce mar­ket in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>All mem­bers of Asean are work­ing hard to re­vive their economies and mit­i­gate the eco­nomic im­pact on the most vul­ner­a­ble mem­bers of their so­ci­eties. To this end, Asean lead­ers are ex­pected to launch the Asean Pandemic Re­cov­ery Fund next month to help fill the re­gion’s US$2.8 tril­lion in­fra­struc­ture gap over the next few years as well as pro­vid­ing more im­me­di­ate eco­nomic stim­u­lus.</p>
    <p>Link­ing the Asean Pandemic Re­cov­ery Fund to cli­mate and sus­tain­abil­ity com­mit­ments will go a long way to re­duce the im­pact of cli­mate change on the re­gion’s economies and peo­ples.</p>
    <p>Sup­ply side struc­tural re­forms nec­es­sary</p>
    <p>Ed­i­to­rial</p>
    <p>China Daily, China</p>
    <p>Although the 4.9 per cent year-on-year growth of the Chi­nese econ­omy in the third quar­ter was slightly be­low some fore­casts of 5 per cent to 5.5 per cent, the eco­nomic data an­nounced by the Na­tional Bureau of Statis­tics last Mon­day re­mains en­cour­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>Not only does the gross do­mes­tic prod­uct growth sig­nal that the ro­bust re­cov­ery of the sec­ond quar­ter has been main­tained, but more im­por­tantly, al­most all the lead­ing eco­nomic in­di­ca­tors give cause for op­ti­mism that the re­cov­ery mo­men­tum can be main­tained.</p>
    <p>All sec­tors had en­cour­ag­ing data that boosted their per­for­mance for the year so far, with agri­cul­ture push­ing its third-quar­ter growth to 2.3 per cent, and in­dus­try and the ser­vice sec­tor grow­ing by 0.9 per cent and 0.4 per cent, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>No­tably, three key in­dus­tries – high-tech, equip­ment man­u­fac­tur­ing and fi­nan­cial – along with in­for­ma­tion and soft­ware-re­lated ser­vices, all recorded ro­bust year-on-year third-quar­ter growth.</p>
    <p>The pos­i­tive trade data shows China has quickly adapted to the fast-chang­ing ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment, as it re­flects pos­i­tive trade growth with all of its ma­jor trade part­ners, in­clud­ing the United States.</p>
    <p>De­spite con­sump­tion re­plac­ing in­vest­ment and trade as China’s largest growth driver five years ago, ro­bust trade is still of vi­tal im­por­tance for cre­at­ing jobs, stok­ing in­no­va­tion and ex­pand­ing open­ing up.</p>
    <p>While China’s re­cov­ery is clearly gath­er­ing steam, of­fer­ing hope for the strug­gling global econ­omy, Na­tional Bureau of Statis­tics spokesman Liu Ai­hua cau­tioned that “the econ­omy is still in the process of re­cov­ery”.</p>
    <p>De­spite the across-the-board im­prove­ments, the foun­da­tion for sus­tain­able re­cov­ery re­quires fur­ther con­sol­i­da­tion due to global un­cer­tain­ties and un­even per­for­mance at home, as Ms Liu said. That re­quires that the new dual cir­cu­la­tion pat­tern be re­in­forced with sup­ply side struc­tural re­forms.</p>
    <p>Re­vive econ­omy to tackle job­less­ness</p>
    <p>Ed­i­to­rial</p>
    <p>Philip­pine Daily In­quirer, The Philip­pines</p>
    <p>There ap­pears to be lit­tle that the gov­ern­ment can do to con­tain the wave of job losses af­fect­ing over­seas Filipino work­ers (OFWs), given the global eco­nomic down­turn. And much of its lim­ited cash re­sources have been redi­rected to ef­forts to con­tain the spread of Covid-19 and mit­i­gate the im­pact of the crip­pling lock­downs, es­pe­cially on poor house­holds.</p>
    <p>With mil­lions out of work and hunger pangs across the pop­u­lace felt more keenly than at any other time, ac­cord­ing to sur­veys, the gov­ern­ment and the pri­vate sec­tor need to work to­gether even more closely to ad­dress the bleak sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, pro­grammes have to be put in place to ac­com­mo­date the tens of thou­sands of Filipino con­tract work­ers now stream­ing back into the coun­try and swelling the ranks of the lo­cal un­em­ployed.</p>
    <p>They need to be rein­te­grated back into the do­mes­tic econ­omy, and the as­sis­tance should be more than just free en­tre­pre­neur­ial and in­for­ma­tion technology train­ing</p>
    <p>and fi­nan­cial ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The pro­jec­tions that the num­ber of de­ployed Filipino work­ers over­seas could fall by about 300,000 this year, to add to the mil­lions al­ready out of work, mean that the coun­try will be fac­ing un­prece­dented lev­els of job­less­ness and want in the months ahead.</p>
    <p>Re­viv­ing the econ­omy to pro­vide work for ev­ery­one, es­pe­cially dis­placed skilled OFWs, should be the big­gest fire light­ing up the gov­ern­ment’s bum at this time.</p>
    <p>Bud­get to the na­tion’s res­cue</p>
    <p>Ed­i­to­rial</p>
    <p>Sin Chew Daily, Malaysia</p>
    <p>On the back of a wors­en­ing virus out­break, eco­nomic down­turn and ex­pected sharp de­cline in the Malaysian gov­ern­ment’s tax rev­enue in the com­ing year, how is the Prime Min­is­ter go­ing to come up with a fis­cal bud­get that will ben­e­fit the peo­ple to take care of their liveli­hood while pro­mot­ing sus­tained op­er­a­tions of lo­cal busi­nesses? The long-term sus­tain­abil­ity agenda should be an ef­fec­tive so­lu­tion in the up­com­ing bud­get.</p>
    <p>First, the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund re­ported that Malaysia’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) will shrink by 6 per cent or al­most RM92 billion (S$30 billion) this year. As such, tax rev­enue next year is ex­pected to dwin­dle dras­ti­cally, mean­ing the gov­ern­ment will not have suf­fi­cient funds to de­velop the coun­try, and this will im­pact the lives of or­di­nary cit­i­zens. New sources of in­come need to be ex­plored in or­der to ex­pand the Trea­sury’s fi­nan­cial ca­pa­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, it is im­per­a­tive for gov­ern­ment de­part­ments to cut their ex­penses dur­ing this crit­i­cal mo­ment.</p>
    <p>Third, last year’s budgetary deficit was at 3.2 per cent of the GDP, and in­creas­ing the bud­get deficit will likely be a hur­ried and im­por­tant op­tion for Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin. He may have to fix the near-term prob­lems first and pin his hopes on a strong re­cov­ery next year.</p>
    <p>Fourth, the gov­ern­ment needs to ad­dress the is­sue of poverty among the peo­ple. Cur­rently, the to­tal in­come of the low­est 20 per cent stands at about 5.9 per cent of the to­tal in­come. Their per capita in­come is merely US$3,313 (S$4,500), or about RM1,160 per month.</p>
