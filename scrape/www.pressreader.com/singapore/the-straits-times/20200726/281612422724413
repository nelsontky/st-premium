    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and Fi­nance Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat, who will take on an ad­di­tional role as Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies, said yes­ter­day that his top pri­or­ity is to pro­tect peo­ple’s rice bowls amid the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“We are go­ing to be faced with a very se­vere re­ces­sion – our top pri­or­ity must be on jobs,” he said at a press con­fer­ence where Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong an­nounced the new Cabi­net line-up.</p>
    <p>“We need to pro­tect our work­ers, help them re­tain their jobs, cre­ate new jobs, and build new skills among our work­ers, in­clud­ing our fresh grad­u­ates from our ITE, poly­tech­nics and uni­ver­si­ties.”</p>
    <p>To­wards this end, Mr Heng said he will work closely with labour chief Ng Chee Meng, Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam, who chairs the Na­tional Jobs Coun</p>
    <p>PRE­PAR­ING FOR SE­VERE RE­CES­SION</p>
    <p>We are go­ing to be faced with a very se­vere re­ces­sion – our top pri­or­ity must be on jobs... We need to pro­tect our work­ers, help them re­tain their jobs, cre­ate new jobs, and build new skills among our work­ers, in­clud­ing our fresh grad­u­ates from our ITE, poly­tech­nics ’’ and uni­ver­si­ties.</p>
    <p>DEPUTY PRIME MIN­IS­TER HENG SWEE KEAT, who will take on an ad­di­tional role as Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies.</p>
    <p>cil set up re­cently to grow jobs and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans, as well as the Fu­ture Econ­omy Coun­cil (FEC).</p>
    <p>The FEC, chaired by Mr Heng, was es­tab­lished in 2017 to drive the growth and trans­for­ma­tion of Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy for the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>It also over­sees the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the rec­om­men­da­tions put forth by the Com­mit­tee on the Fu­ture Econ­omy, like the rolling out of the In­dus­try Trans­for­ma­tion Maps.</p>
    <p>More re­cently, in May, Mr Heng was in the pri­vate sec­tor.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause of the fact that I am able to nav­i­gate in my past life and also un­der­stand some of the dif­fi­cul­ties, I can ar­tic­u­late and form a bridge be­tween the pub­lic and the pri­vate sec­tor,” he said.</p>
    <p>In his Man­power port­fo­lio, one is­sue he wants to look at is how to fund “longer-term needs, the health­care needs” of mi­grant work­ers. In his other min­istry, he spoke of the need to find ways to trans­form in­dus­tries and also con­tin­u­ally at­tract in­vest­ments here.</p>
    <p>Mr Alvin Tan told The Sun­day also set up the Emerg­ing Stronger Task­force.</p>
    <p>Led by new Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Des­mond Lee and PSA In­ter­na­tional group chief ex­ec­u­tive Tan Chong Meng, the task force com­prises in­dus­try-led al­liances that will pro­to­type new ideas.</p>
    <p>The aim is to come up with suc­cess­ful projects that can be­come growth ar­eas and gen­er­ate new jobs.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee, who was also at the press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, said the task</p>
    <p>Times he has ten­dered his res­ig­na­tion at LinkedIn, and is cur­rently serv­ing no­tice. Hence, he will start his new ap­point­ments from Sept 1.</p>
    <p>Point­ing to his ex­pe­ri­ence in dif­fer­ent sec­tors dur­ing his ca­reer, he said: “Be­ing very in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary, that might be very help­ful to gov­ern­ment. You look at MTI, it’s about job cre­ation, its about open­ing new op­por­tu­ni­ties. And if we are to take on these new op­por­tu­ni­ties, a mul­tidis­ci­plinary ap­proach might come in very handy.” force has en­gaged in­dus­tries, unions and in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing, and will be speak­ing to Sin­ga­pore­ans, civil so­ci­ety and com­mu­nity stake­hold­ers soon.</p>
    <p>But be­yond hav­ing con­ver­sa­tions, it must move “very quickly” into ac­tion, he said.</p>
    <p>“Al­ready, we have seven Sin­ga­pore To­gether Al­liances for Ac­tion look­ing at op­por­tu­ni­ties in the dig­i­tal realm – such as for sup­ply chains, built en­vi­ron­ment, smart com­merce, sus­tain­abil­ity... robotics, edutech and many oth­ers.”</p>
    <p>The task force is also en­gag­ing the FEC to relook trans­for­ma­tion plans to po­si­tion the coun­try well for the fu­ture, he added.</p>
    <p>On the so­cial front, said Mr Lee, the Gov­ern­ment will be launch­ing Emerg­ing Stronger con­ver­sa­tions on so­cioe­co­nomic is­sues to pull to­gether the ef­forts of Sin­ga­pore­ans in re­view­ing is­sues such as work and fam­ily and work­place prac­tices.</p>
