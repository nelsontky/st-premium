    <p>SYD­NEY • Cross-code su­per­star Sonny Bill Wil­liams says he may fi­nally hang up his boots af­ter his up­com­ing stint in Aus­tralia’s National Rugby League (NRL) with the Syd­ney Roost­ers.</p>
    <p>He is com­plet­ing quar­an­tine in Syd­ney be­fore join­ing the Roost­ers, an op­por­tu­nity that arose af­ter the coro­n­avirus pan­demic forced his Toronto Wolf­pack to quit Eng­land’s Su­per League.</p>
    <p>The globe-trot­ting ath­lete, who has won two Rugby World Cups with the All Blacks and two NRL premier­ships in Aus­tralia dur­ing 16 sea­sons of elite sport, ac­knowl­edged that his ca­reer was wind­ing down.</p>
    <p>Auck­land-born Wil­liams said he planned to set­tle in Syd­ney longterm with his wife and four chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“I con­sider Aus­tralia a home even prob­a­bly more so than New Zealand as far as rais­ing the kids and what­not,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I’m a re­al­ist. I’m 35, I’m not a spring chicken any more. I reckon I’ve got maybe one more year max in me.”</p>
    <p>A de­vout Mus­lim with a proud Samoan her­itage, Wil­liams has pre­vi­ously said he wants to be­come in­volved in char­ity and help­ing mi­nori­ties when his sport­ing ca­reer ends.</p>
    <p>He called for more di­ver­sity in the NRL, where mi­nori­ties dom­i­nate play­ing ros­ters but have com­par­a­tively lit­tle rep­re­sen­ta­tion in ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Wil­liams urged prom­i­nent NRL fig­ure Phil Gould to pro­mote Pa­cific is­lan­ders and In­dige­nous Aus­tralians in his re­cently an­nounced role as a con­sul­tant at the New Zealand War­riors.</p>
    <p>“I just try to look at things from a per­spec­tive of what’s best for my peo­ple – Poly­ne­sians, Maoris, Abo­rig­i­nals, the mi­nori­ties,” Wil­liams, whose fa­ther is Samoan, told Gould in an in­ter­view on Chan­nel Nine late on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“I’d love to see you take some­one un­der your wing and help us thrive, not just on the field... ob­vi­ously we’re thriv­ing in that sense.</p>
    <p>“What I would like to chal­lenge you to do is help us thrive off the field, whether it be coaches, CEOs (chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cers) or on the boards, that type of level.”</p>
    <p>More than half of NRL players have Pasi­fika, In­dige­nous Aus­tralian or Maori her­itage but none of the 18 teams’ head coaches have those back­grounds.</p>
    <p>The NRL reg­u­larly cham­pi­ons its di­ver­sity pol­icy and said last year that more than 50 of its staff iden­ti­fied as be­ing of In­dige­nous Aus­tralian her­itage, yet few oc­cupy po­si­tions in se­nior man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Wil­liams played 58 times for the All Blacks, win­ning World Cups in 2011 and 2015, as well as nu­mer­ous Bledis­loe Cups and Rugby Cham­pi­onships.</p>
    <p>Other hon­ours in­clude a Su­per Rugby ti­tle in 2012 and NRL premier­ships in 2004 with the Bull­dogs and in 2013 with the Roost­ers.</p>
    <p>He also rep­re­sented New Zealand in rugby sev­ens at the 2016 Olympics and triumphed i n all seven of his pro­fes­sional heavy­weight box­ing bouts, win­ning the New Zealand ti­tle in 2012.</p>
    <p>SUP­PORT TO MOVE UP</p>
    <p>What I would like to chal­lenge you to do is help us thrive off the field, whether it be coaches, CEOs (chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cers) or on the boards, that type of level. ’’</p>
