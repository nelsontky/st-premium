    <p>Jobs, build­ing a fair and just so­ci­ety, as well as forg­ing a com­mon sense of iden­tity are three key is­sues the Gov­ern­ment will tackle in its new term, Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice In­dra­nee Ra­jah said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>These is­sues had dom­i­nated the par­lia­men­tary de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress in the past five days, clearly re­flect­ing that these con­cerns are at the fore­front of peo­ple’s minds, she said in an in­ter­view with The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, peo­ple are wor­ried about whether they can hold on to their jobs amid the Covid-19 cri­sis, she said.</p>
    <p>“When you have a global re­ces­sion – like in the cur­rent econ­omy</p>
    <p>– and this com­pe­ti­tion for jobs and re­sources, peo­ple ob­vi­ously feel a sense of angst, in­se­cu­rity, and they are re­ally, re­ally anx­ious,” she added. “So, we have to put a lot of at­ten­tion on that.”</p>
    <p>Ms In­dra­nee, who is Leader of the House, is also Se­cond Min­is­ter for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment and Fi­nance.</p>
    <p>The task of com­bat­ing in­equal­ity, a pri­or­ity the Gov­ern­ment iden­ti­fied in its pre­vi­ous term, is of greater ur­gency now in the light of the pan­demic, which has af­fected the less well-off more than those with ex­tra re­sources, added the min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong spoke of the need to start think­ing about how to strengthen so­cial safety nets, and the best way to do it.</p>
    <p>Ms In­dra­nee re­it­er­ated that a key prin­ci­ple in such con­sid­er­a­tions is fis­cal pru­dence.</p>
    <p>It is par­tic­u­larly im­por­tant now that the Gov­ern­ment’s nor­mal sources of rev­enue, in­clud­ing in­come tax, cor­po­rate tax and the goods and ser­vices tax, are set to to take a hit, she said.</p>
    <p>“We are look­ing at a sit­u­a­tion where, clearly, there will be re</p>
    <p>duced rev­enues, and we have al­ready had vastly in­creased ex­pen­di­ture. We will have to bal­ance it.”</p>
    <p>This, how­ever, does not mean fur­ther fi­nan­cial sup­port for the lower-in­come has been ruled out, she added, point­ing to how the Gov­ern­ment took great pains to help the lower-in­come cope with the cri­sis with fi­nan­cial re­lief schemes like the Covid-19 Sup­port Grant and gro­cery vouch­ers .</p>
    <p>“We will not let those in need fall. We will make sure that we catch them,” she pledged. “We will make sure no­body goes with­out.”</p>
    <p>On the is­sue of iden­tity, she said that in­creas­ingly, there is a sense of a gen­er­a­tional dif­fer­ence, if not a gen­er­a­tional change, among Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Dif­fer­ent gen­er­a­tions may dif­fer not just in terms of life ex­pe­ri­ences, but also on is­sues they view as im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>“But there may be some things which are univer­sal. So, it is (about) get­ting a sense of that gen­er­a­tional dif­fer­ence, and to make sure that no mat­ter what, we are able to progress to­gether as one peo­ple – united, not po­larised.”</p>
