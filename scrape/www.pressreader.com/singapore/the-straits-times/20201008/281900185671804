    <p>LONDON • A tech­ni­cal glitch that left nearly 16,000 Covid-19 cases un­doc­u­mented in Bri­tain was caused by Mi­crosoft Ex­cel files ex­ceed­ing their max­i­mum size, the coun­try’s Health Sec­re­tary has said.</p>
    <p>The er­ror “should never have hap­pened”, Mr Matt Han­cock told the House of Com­mons, promis­ing that the gov­ern­ment would in­ves­ti­gate the mat­ter and up­grade its out­moded com­puter sys­tems.</p>
    <p>The Health Sec­re­tary on Mon­day gave Mem­bers of Par­lia­ment a run­down on how the 15,841 pos­i­tive test re­sults recorded be­tween Sept 25 and last Fri­day were not re­ported in the coun­try’s daily fig­ures – and, crit­i­cally, were not passed onto the trac­ing pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Those who tested pos­i­tive were in­formed of their re­sults but were not then called by trac­ers – mean­ing any­one whom they had close con­tact with had also not re­ceived in­struc­tions to self-iso­late. Sci­en­tific ex­perts say that must hap­pen within 48 hours for a test-and-trace pro­gramme to be ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>Mr Han­cock said there was a fail­ure in the “au­to­mated trans­fer of files” from lab­o­ra­to­ries to Pub­lic Health Eng­land (PHE).</p>
    <p>“This in­ci­dent should never have hap­pened. But the team have acted swiftly to min­imise its im­pact.”</p>
    <p>PHE said the glitch, dis­cov­ered last Fri­day, had been fixed, and out­stand­ing cases passed on to trac­ers by the next day.</p>
    <p>But, by Mon­day, around half of those pos­i­tive cases still had yet to be asked about their close con­tacts.</p>
    <p>The dis­clo­sure of the glitch brought a storm of crit­i­cism on Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s gov­ern­ment, which has been on the de­fen­sive for its hap­haz­ard han­dling of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>More than 42,000 peo­ple have died from the virus in Bri­tain, the high­est num­ber in Europe, and the coun­try is fac­ing a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions. Bri­tain’s gov­ern­ment coro­n­avirus dash­board yes­ter­day showed a to­tal of over 530,000 Covid-19 cases re­ported to date.</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion Labour Party said the miss­ing re­sults were “putting lives at risk”, with “thou­sands of peo­ple bliss­fully un­aware they have been ex­posed to Covid-19”.</p>
    <p>The er­ror was caused by the Mi­crosoft Ex­cel data files be­ing too large to trans­fer af­ter they were com­piled, BBC re­ported.</p>
    <p>PHE had set up an au­to­mated process to pull to­gether text-based lists of data col­lected by firms paid to carry out Covid-19 swab tests.</p>
    <p>The data was com­piled into Ex­cel tem­plates that were up­loaded to a cen­tral sys­tem and made avail­able to the Na­tional Health Ser­vice’s test-and-trace team.</p>
    <p>But PHE devel­op­ers picked an old file for­mat, .xls, to do this. As a re­sult, each tem­plate could han­dle only about 65,000 rows of data rather than the one mil­lion-plus rows that Ex­cel is ca­pa­ble of.</p>
    <p>When the to­tal was reached, fur­ther cases were sim­ply lopped off.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials said that they even­tu­ally fixed the prob­lem by split­ting up the files and trans­fer­ring smaller amounts of data.</p>
    <p>The glitch meant the num­ber of new daily cases re­ported over that week was lower than the ac­tual num­ber. Daily fig­ures for the end of the week were about 10,000 rather than the 7,000 ini­tially re­ported.</p>
    <p>BBC analysis found that the num­ber of cases re­ported for the week to last Thurs­day rose by around 93 per cent in the North West af­ter ac­count­ing for the er­ror – with sim­i­lar rises re­flected across Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>“The tim­ing of it couldn’t be worse,” said Pro­fes­sor Devi Sridhar, di­rec­tor of the global health gov­er­nance pro­gramme at the Univer­sity of Ed­in­burgh. “You’re head­ing into win­ter, and we al­ready knew that cases were ris­ing. This is re­ally when you’d need your te­s­tand-trace sys­tem to do its work.”</p>
