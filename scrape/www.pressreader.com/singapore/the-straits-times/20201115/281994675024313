    <p>New species of fauna are not some­thing usu­ally as­so­ci­ated with ur­banised Sin­ga­pore. Yet the first com­pre­hen­sive Ubin bio­di­ver­sity sur­vey on Pu­lau Ubin has dis­cov­ered a spi­der species new to sci­ence, doc­u­mented six an­i­mals not seen here be­fore, and 13 oth­ers that are firsts for Ubin. The sur­vey’s pre­lim­i­nary find­ings, re­leased in Septem­ber, are heart­en­ing for sev­eral rea­sons.</p>
    <p>First, they are a vivid re­minder of Mother Na­ture’s re­silience. Pu­lau Ubin, de­spite its as­so­ci­a­tions with rus­tic charms, has seen much hu­man in­ter­fer­ence, pri­mar­ily from gran­ite min­ing. Its cur­rent abun­dance is a sign that na­ture can re­cover – and fairly rapidly. Sec­ond, Ubin’s suc­cess as a wildlife sanc­tu­ary is tes­ta­ment to how a civil so­ci­ety and gov­ern­ment part­ner­ship can work for the ben­e­fit of all, as the ex­am­ple of pre­serv­ing Chek Jawa in the early 2000s also showed. Third, the is­land is a cap­sule that of­fers on­go­ing lessons for Sin­ga­pore as it strives to be­come a bio­philic city un­der the Na­tional Parks Board’s 10-year vi­sion, which en­tails not just a more in­ten­sive green­ing of this con­crete jun­gle but also recog­ni­tion on the part of cit­i­zens of the value of our nat­u­ral en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>The lat­ter is al­ready happening as Sin­ga­pore­ans, kept home with travel curbs dur­ing the Covid-19 pandemic, turn to na­ture for re­lief and re­cre­ation. This will hope­fully see more of them be­ing ac­tive in pre­serv­ing nat­u­ral riches for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions. For a start, they can be mind­ful and not lit­ter na­ture parks. Those who want to be more ac­tively in­volved can seek out com­mu­nity gar­dens and vol­un­teer their ser­vices. NParks’ seed dis­tri­bu­tion ini­tia­tive met with over­whelm­ing de­mand this year, and it also of­fers an app for cit­i­zens to help doc­u­ment wildlife. Com­mu­nity gar­dens could be­come next-gen­er­a­tion farms, which in turn could re­duce Sin­ga­pore’s car­bon foot­print. Pro­vid­ing space for na­ture also of­fers hu­mans a nec­es­sary refuge.</p>
