    <p>The great­est chal­lenge fac­ing hu­man­ity now is an in­creas­ingly di­vided world, and it is im­por­tant that its lead­ers take a stand against uni­lat­er­al­ism and de­struc­tive ri­val­ries, Emer­i­tus Se­nior Min­is­ter Goh Chok Tong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>With ref­er­ence to the sharp­en­ing United States-China ri­valry, he said both coun­tries saw each other as their most sig­nif­i­cant long-term se­cu­rity threat and warned that if the two na­tions played a “neg­a­tive sum game”, the world would suf­fer.</p>
    <p>“No coun­try wants to be lorded over by an­other coun­try, nor does it want to be tram­pled like the grass be­neath two war­ring ele­phants,” said ESM Goh in a vir­tual speech at this year’s Jeju Fo­rum for Peace and Pros­per­ity.</p>
    <p>“Con­cerned lead­ers and opin­ion mak­ers should there­fore speak out against uni­lat­er­al­ism and de­struc­tive ri­valry, and ad­vo­cate mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism, rule of law, con­struc­tive in­ter­na­tional con­duct and co­op­er­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing an au­di­ence of world lead­ers and aca­demics, ESM Goh said that such in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion is es­pe­cially im­por­tant now, given the threats posed by the on­go­ing Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He noted that Sin­ga­pore and like-minded coun­tries such as South Korea have stepped up ef­forts to strengthen mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism amid the pan­demic. This in­cludes pre­serv­ing global con­nec­tiv­ity and work­ing to­gether to make sure there will be fair and eq­ui­table global ac­cess to Covid-19 vac­cines when they be­come avail­able.</p>
    <p>While the pan­demic has laid bare the ten­den­cies of some coun­tries to look in­ward in times of cri­sis, ESM Goh held up the work of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) in mo­bil­is­ing global re­sources and med­i­cal knowl­edge to help coun­tries deal with the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>More, how­ever, can be done, said ESM Goh, urg­ing coun­tries to re­vi­talise the United Na­tions (UN) Gen­eral Assem­bly, re­form the UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil and con­tinue giv­ing the WHO their fullest sup­port.</p>
    <p>He sug­gested the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion ad­dress new eco­nomic re­al­i­ties and in­cor­po­rate new ar­eas of eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity, such as the dig­i­tal econ­omy, and that the Paris Agree­ment on cli­mate change be im­ple­mented.</p>
    <p>“We must rein­vig­o­rate mul­ti­lat­eral in­sti­tu­tions to rec­tify the struc­tural flaws in our sys­tem and re­spond ef­fec­tively to the chal­lenges of the fu­ture,” he said.</p>
    <p>The an­nual fo­rum sees global lead­ers dis­cussing in­ter­na­tional peace, sta­bil­ity and se­cu­rity is­sues through global co­op­er­a­tion. Par­tic­i­pants this year in­clude UN Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral An­to­nio Guter­res, his pre­de­ces­sor Ban Ki-moon and for­mer US pres­i­dent Bill Clin­ton.</p>
    <p>In a video mes­sage, Mr Guter­res said that co­op­er­a­tion be­tween na­tions is fun­da­men­tal to ad­dress­ing chal­lenges for the world, in­clud­ing ex­tend­ing univer­sal health cov­er­age, de­liv­er­ing on sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment goals and pre­vent­ing dis­as­ters and crises of all kinds.</p>
    <p>Mr Ban said the world can swiftly over­come the pan­demic only when hu­mans and coun­tries all de­cide to work to­gether.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter all, co­op­er­a­tion be­tween hu­mans and be­tween coun­tries is not a mat­ter of choice but a ne­ces­sity. Restor­ing the spirit of mul­ti­lat­eral co­op­er­a­tion is es­sen­tial to over­come the cri­sis,” he said.</p>
