    <p>Trained as an in­te­rior de­signer, home owner Wen Ng spe­cialised in com­mer­cial projects in Tai­wan and China be­fore re­turn­ing to Sin­ga­pore in 2016 to join the fam­ily business.</p>
    <p>When he and his wife Sheena, who are both in their 30s, bought their first home here, he knew he had to de­sign it him­self.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing worked in mar­kets like Tai­wan and China, I have been ex­posed to the big play­ers and how ver­sa­tile the de­sign scene is. I was also go­ing to source for many fur­ni­ture pieces and ma­te­ri­als overseas, so it would be eas­ier to just do it my­self,” says Mr Ng, a busi­ness­man of Sin­ga­porean and Tai­wanese de­scent.</p>
    <p>He wanted to start on a clean slate as the apartment – a three­bed­room con­do­minium in East Coast – was from the 1980s and in need of a ma­jor ren­o­va­tion.</p>
    <p>Hence the floors, walls and ceil­ing were stripped bare and re­done, the kitchen wall was re­moved and some of the awk­ward win­dow open­ings were sealed up. Mr Ng even rewired the whole place.</p>
    <p>He says: “I was in­spired to cre­ate a con­tem­po­rary French theme be­cause I love Paris. I visit the French cap­i­tal of­ten as my sis­ter lives there. It was also a chal­lenge to see if I could pull off a French-style apartment in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>The de­sign it­self was con­cep­tu­alised in just two weeks, but the ren­o­va­tion took three to four months to com­plete as cer­tain ma­te­ri­als, like the Bel­gium cor­nices, took some time to ar­rive. The couple moved into the 2,100 sq ft apartment in Au­gust 2018 and de­clined to re­veal the cost of the ren­o­va­tion.</p>
    <p>The most chal­leng­ing as­pect of the project was fur­ni­ture sourc­ing. Mr Ng says: “It was time-con­sum­ing as I was not al­ways able to find what I wanted at the right price.”</p>
    <p>But the ef­forts have paid off.</p>
    <p>In the din­ing area, an aca­cia wood din­ing ta­ble with an un­usual blush un­der­tone is com­ple­mented by a set of pink Gubi Bee­tle din­ing chairs. Brass chair legs of­fer the first hint of a French ac­cent.</p>
    <p>The orig­i­nal kitchen wall is re­placed with te­le­scopic slid­ing glass doors to cre­ate an open plan and the kitchen now has a more con­tem­po­rary treat­ment with a monochro­matic grey and white palette. Mi­unn bar stools by Fin­nish de­signer Karri Monni for Ital­ian brand La­palma com­plete the set-up.</p>
    <p>An ex­ist­ing beam be­tween the din­ing and liv­ing ar­eas has been de­signed as part of a frame that sep­a­rates the two spa­ces while the her­ring­bone floor­ing, light green walls and Euro­pean el­e­ments – such as wain­scot­ing and white ceil­ing mould­ings – con­tinue through­out.</p>
    <p>“Many peo­ple as­so­ciate white with the French, but light green walls are com­mon in France,” says Mr Ng, a father of a one-year-old girl.</p>
    <p>Other pieces such as the cof­fee ta­ble and me­dia con­sole from French la­bels Mai­son Jansen and Ligne Roset ac­cen­tu­ate the French theme in the liv­ing room.</p>
    <p>Against one wall of the liv­ing room is a sym­met­ri­cal com­po­si­tion that is “typ­i­cal of the French”.</p>
    <p>Two Happy Hour arm­chairs from Ital­ian la­bel Flex­form sit on ei­ther side of a Ligne Roset Oxy­da­tion side ta­ble. On the wall be­hind them, two Zenith wall sconces from Bac­carat flank a re­pro­duc­tion of an oil paint­ing called Straw­berry On Tin­foil by Han Wu-lin, a rel­a­tive of Mr Ng’s.</p>
    <p>Be­yond a con­cealed door be­tween the din­ing and liv­ing ar­eas is the cor­ri­dor lead­ing to the bed­rooms.</p>
    <p>The most strik­ing as­pect is the light­ing, which im­bues an oth­er­wise util­i­tar­ian space with an ethe­real qual­ity. Light con­cealed be­hind the door frames bathes the tran­si­tional space in a dif­fused glow and makes it ap­pear more spa­cious.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng says: “It is im­por­tant to have a dif­fer­ent hi­er­ar­chy of light­ing within the home. Us­ing a com­bi­na­tion of con­cealed lights, wall lights, down­lights and pen­dant lights, you can vary the am­bi­ence of a space.”</p>
    <p>The master bed­room is an oa­sis of calm. The fur­ni­ture is sim­ple and min­i­mal as Mr Ng does not want to clut­ter the space. He en­closed the ex­ist­ing nar­row bal­cony and put it to much bet­ter use as a cosy al­cove. In typ­i­cal French style, the walk-in wardrobe and en-suite bath­room are hid­den be­hind a con­cealed door.</p>
    <p>For him, apart from craft­ing an in­te­rior with a con­tem­po­rary French theme, it is also about cre­at­ing dif­fer­ent vibes within dif­fer­ent zones. He be­lieves that “ev­ery space you sit in should feel like a dif­fer­ent home” and that peo­ple should be mind­ful about look­ing out from a space, in­stead of just look­ing at it.</p>
    <p>“If it looks right from where you are seated, it will most prob­a­bly look right from the out­side in,” he con­cludes.</p>
