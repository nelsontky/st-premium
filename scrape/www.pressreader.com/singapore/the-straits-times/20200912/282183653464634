    <p>Chi­nese cui­sine chef Tan Yong Hua, who owned Restau­rant Home in Tampines Street 43, died of heart fail­ure in his sleep on Wed­nes­day night. He was 47.</p>
    <p>An an­nounce­ment posted on the restau­rant’s Face­book page on Thurs­day said he “passed away peace­fully”.</p>
    <p>He leaves be­hind his wife and a seven-year-old son.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean started his cook­ing ca­reer in his teens and worked at sev­eral five-star ho­tels, in­clud­ing Szechuan Court in Raf­fles The Plaza (now Fair­mont Sin­ga­pore) and Peach Blos­soms in Ma­rina Man­darin Sin­ga­pore (now Parkroyal Col­lec­tion Ma­rina Bay).</p>
    <p>He opened a restau­rant, ChuDao, in Joo Chiat Road in 2011 with a part­ner, but they parted ways a year later.</p>
    <p>In 2013, Chef Tan started Restau­rant Home, which was known for its Pek­ing duck and homey dishes such as steamed fish and rice ver­mi­celli with pork knuckle.</p>
    <p>The restau­rant moved to Cos­ford Road in Changi three years later and then to the Hous­ing Board block in Tampines last year.</p>
    <p>Ms Koh Swee Har, 66, a re­tired food jour­nal­ist with Lianhe Wan­bao, who has known the chef for more than 10 years, re­mem­bers him as an af­fa­ble and help­ful per­son.</p>
    <p>She re­called: “He was a very creative chef. He cooked a gi­ant ocean sun­fish in dif­fer­ent ways when he was in Peach Blos­soms, which was the first time I tasted the fish.</p>
    <p>“His veg­e­tar­ian dishes at Szechuan Court – such as pump­kin rice and fried zuc­chini flower – were also un­for­get­table.”</p>
