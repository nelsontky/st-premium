    <p>MR MASAGOS ZULKIFLI, MIN­IS­TER FOR SO­CIAL AND FAM­ILY DE­VEL­OP­MENT</p>
    <p>A new e-com­merce plat­form has been launched for lo­cal fur­ni­ture brands to dis­play their prod­ucts and at­tract con­sumers, as the Covid-19 pan­demic puts a halt on ex­hi­bi­tions and trade fairs.</p>
    <p>The web­site, www.cre­ativs­pace.com, which boasts fea­tures such as vir­tual show­rooms, now has 20 home-grown brands.</p>
    <p>An­other 80 are ex­pected to join over the next 12 months.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Fur­ni­ture Industries Coun­cil, which is be­hind the ini­tia­tive, said it hopes to bring in fur­ni­ture de­sign­ers and man­u­fac­tur­ers from Asean coun­tries be­yond the first year.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the launch of the web­site yes­ter­day, Min­is­ter of State for Trade and In­dus­try Low Yen Ling said the web­site will trans­form the way fur­ni­ture and fit­tings are pro­cured and mar­keted by lo­cal fur­ni­ture com­pa­nies, with the in­clu­sion of fea­tures such as aug­mented re­al­ity tech­nol­ogy and vir­tual show­rooms.</p>
    <p>“It also pro­vides a plat­form for in­dus­try play­ers to reach out to in­ter­na­tional clien­tele and ex­pand their business foot­print be­yond Sin­ga­pore,” added Ms Low, who is also Min­is­ter of State for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies can dis­play their prod­ucts on the web­site in three­d­i­men­sional form to give view­ers an “im­mer­sive show­room ex­pe­ri­ence”.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers, in­clud­ing ar­chi­tects and in­te­rior de­sign­ers, can re­quest fur­ni­ture prod­ucts and pric­ing through the site.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies can also get feed­back from de­sign­ers, man­u­fac­tur­ers and re­tail­ers on how to bet­ter mar­ket their prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Up­hol­stery man­u­fac­turer Danovel has put its prod­ucts on Creativ-Space as the firm seeks to ex­pand its mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s business de­vel­op­ment di­rec­tor, Mr Mar­cus Wong, said: “As a tra­di­tional business, a lot of Danovel’s sales in the past were made based on old meth­ods, by means of en­tic­ing cus­tomers to visit our show­room.</p>
    <p>“With Creativ-Space, Danovel now has a 10,000 sq ft vir­tual show­room at a frac­tion of the cost of a phys­i­cal one and we can now show our cus­tomised fur­ni­ture to any­one in the world.”</p>
