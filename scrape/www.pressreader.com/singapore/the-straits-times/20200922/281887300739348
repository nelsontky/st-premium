    <p>Aus­tralia’s farms face a short­age of sea­sonal work­ers for the up­com­ing pick­ing sea­son but may get a boost from a pro­posal be­ing pitched by the tourism au­thor­i­ties to the fed­eral gov­ern­ment to let back­pack­ers be among the first in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tors al­lowed back in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Each year, hordes of back­pack­ers come from around the world to help pick fruit, veg­eta­bles and other crops at the na­tion’s farms.</p>
    <p>They are seen as cru­cial to the agri­cul­tural sec­tor which needs short-term sea­sonal work­ers – a de­mand that the lo­cal Aus­tralian work­force can­not meet.</p>
    <p>But the prob­lem this year is that Aus­tralia has barred en­try to for­eign­ers due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, leav­ing farm­ers fac­ing the prospect of with­er­ing crops.</p>
    <p>There are about 73,000 back­pack­ers who have re­mained in Aus­tralia since the travel ban was im­posed in March. Be­fore the pan­demic, there would have been about 150,000.</p>
    <p>About 10,000 back­pack­ers leave each month, rais­ing con­cerns that Aus­tralia will have as few as 20,000 to 30,000 dur­ing the busy pick­ing months at the end of the year.</p>
    <p>Farm­ers and the tourism sec­tor are urg­ing the gov­ern­ment to grant these work­ing hol­i­day­mak­ers – as well as in­ter­na­tional stu­dents – a one-year visa ex­ten­sion.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian Tourism In­dus­try Coun­cil, which rep­re­sents about 10,000 busi­nesses, has called for the fed­eral gov­ern­ment to work on a pi­lot scheme to al­low back­pack­ers to be among the first in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tors to re­turn to Aus­tralia. It said back­pack­ers would be suitable be­cause they of­ten in­tend to stay for lengthy pe­ri­ods and would be will­ing to self-quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>“The ab­sence of back­pack­ers is be­ing harshly felt,” said the coun­cil’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Si­mon West­away.</p>
    <p>“Back­pack­ers travel ex­ten­sively through Aus­tralia tak­ing up hardto-fill roles across key re­gional in­dus­tries in­clud­ing tourism and hos­pi­tal­ity as well as ar­eas of agri­cul­ture and hor­ti­cul­ture.”</p>
    <p>As of yes­ter­day, Aus­tralia had recorded 26,912 cases of Covid-19, of which 19.4 per cent were ac­quired over­seas and the re­main­der lo­cally.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s bor­ders re­main closed to all foreign cit­i­zens, but it has started a trial scheme to al­low sea­sonal work­ers from Van­u­atu, which has no Covid-19 cases, to work on farms.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia of­fers a 12-month work­ing hol­i­day visa for cit­i­zens aged up to 30 or 35 from more than 40 spec­i­fied coun­tries, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Last year, the fed­eral gov­ern­ment in­creased the num­ber of Sin­ga­pore­ans el­i­gi­ble for this visa each year from 500 to 2,500. The visa can be ex­tended for a fur­ther two years if hold­ers un­der­take spec­i­fied work in re­gional ar­eas.</p>
    <p>More than 300,000 work­ing hol­i­day­mak­ers vis­ited Aus­tralia last year, spend­ing about A$3.2 bil­lion (S$3.1 bil­lion). These vis­i­tors are par­tic­u­larly val­ued be­cause, un­like many reg­u­lar in­ter­na­tional tourists, they ven­ture out­side ma­jor cities and travel to more re­mote and re­gional ar­eas.</p>
    <p>But farm­ers have warned that the in­ter­na­tional travel curbs have left them fac­ing loom­ing labour short­ages in the lead-up to the busy sum­mer months.</p>
    <p>An or­gan­i­sa­tion which rep­re­sents veg­etable grow­ers, AusVeg, said many back­pack­ers who are cur­rently in Aus­tralia are ex­hausted and “ready to go home”.</p>
    <p>“We’ll prob­a­bly see a greater de­pre­ci­a­tion of those back­packer num­bers in the lead-up to Christ­mas,” the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s pub­lic af­fairs man­ager Tyson Cat­tle told The Aus­tralian news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>“That’s ob­vi­ously our peak pe­riod. If we see a mass ex­o­dus over Novem­ber and De­cem­ber, who will re­place them?”</p>
    <p>But ef­forts to al­low cur­rent visa hold­ers to stay on in Aus­tralia are still un­likely to fill the labour gap for farm work­ers and calls are grow­ing to en­cour­age Aus­tralians them­selves to take sea­sonal jobs, es­pe­cially as the coun­try faces higher un­em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Agri­cul­ture Min­is­ter David Lit­tleproud has also sug­gested that Aus­tralian school leavers who typ­i­cally spend a gap year over­seas may want to back­pack do­mes­ti­cally and work in ru­ral ar­eas.</p>
    <p>“We’re go­ing to see a lot of Year 12 stu­dents fin­ish in a cou­ple of months and they are not go­ing to have the op­por­tu­nity to go back­pack around the world,” he told re­porters last week. “There may be an op­por­tu­nity to back­pack around the coun­try and make a quid while they’re do­ing it.”</p>
