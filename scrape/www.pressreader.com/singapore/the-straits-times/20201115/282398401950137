    <p>“Men ev­ery­where!” Christina The’s mother pro­claimed. She, along with hordes of panic buy­ers, had de­scended upon Sin­ga­pore’s su­per­mar­kets when Malaysia closed its bor­ders due to Covid-19. “Oh good,” The replied. “Can meet new man there.”</p>
    <p>“Men ev­ery­where!” Christina The’s mother pro­claimed. She, along with hordes of panic buy­ers, had de­scended upon Sin­ga­pore’s su­per­mar­kets when Malaysia closed its bor­ders due to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“Oh good,” The replied. “Can meet new man there.”</p>
    <p>“How can you find a new boyfriend there?” her mother shot back. “I had to wres­tle a cab­bage from a man just now! They are not in­ter­ested in women! They want food! Toi­let pa­per!”</p>
    <p>These sto­ries, based on real in­ci­dents, though ex­ag­ger­ated for comic ef­fect, are com­piled in Di­ary Of A For­mer Co­vid­iot, the first book by The, an In­done­sia-born, Sin­ga­pore-based opera singer.</p>
    <p>The pandemic has worn on long enough that books writ­ten dur­ing it are mak­ing their way into print.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, these range from hu­mor­ous books like The’s to In The Year Of The Virus, a po­etry comic by Felix Cheong and il­lus­tra­tor Eko.</p>
    <p>In the an­thol­ogy Un­masked, Malaysian writer Shamini Flint col­lects works and photos about the pandemic by a wide range of peo­ple – from Sin­ga­porean po­ets such as Alvin Pang and Ng Yi-Sheng to renowned Kenyan writer Ngugi wa Thiong’o .</p>
    <p>In April, Flint, 51, the Sin­ga­pore­based au­thor of the In­spec­tor Singh mys­tery nov­els, be­gan ask­ing around on so­cial me­dia for sub­mis­sions.</p>
    <p>“I no­ticed that so-called pro­fes­sional writ­ers like my­self were strug­gling to ex­press our thoughts in this new par­a­digm and yet so many oth­ers were seek­ing to ex­press their feel­ings – that sense of hope and dread, of lone­li­ness and iso­la­tion, in fresh and in­ter­est­ing ways,” she says.</p>
    <p>“It struck me that it would be great to com­pile some of these voices, in as many dif­fer­ent me­dia as pos­si­ble, to pro­vide us all with a keep­sake or mem­ory of these times or a guide for the best way we can col­lec­tively nav­i­gate this new re­al­ity.”</p>
    <p>For The, a di­vorcee in her 30s, much of this new re­al­ity in­volved wran­gling her daugh­ters, aged nine and six, through home-based learn­ing.</p>
    <p>“I could write only be­tween the un­godly hours of 9pm and 4am dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, when the liv­ing room was mine – all mine – with no lit­tle trolls in sight,” she quips.</p>
    <p>Her book chron­i­cles her shift from “Co­vid­iot” – a so­cial but­ter­fly who hugs peo­ple at par­ties and laughs off oth­ers’ para­noia – to cau­tious “Covi­dol”, after she had a rude shock when her neigh­bour turned out to be an im­ported Covid-19 case.</p>
    <p>Else­where, the pandemic has been enor­mously pro­duc­tive for au­thor Cheong, 55.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, he not only pro­duced the po­ems of In The Year Of The Virus, but also an­other il­lus­trated po­etry book, Od­dballs, Screw­balls And Other Ec­centrics; a chil­dren’s book for Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore, ti­tled A Day At The Gallery; and a li­bretto for what could be the world’s first</p>
    <p>opera about a safe-dis­tanc­ing en­force­ment of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>Cheong says that at the start of the out­break, he grew fright­ened of how the in­fec­tion numbers kept creep­ing up. “I chan­nelled that fear and para­noia into the po­ems.”</p>
    <p>Still, he and il­lus­tra­tor Eko – the pseu­do­nym of 23-year-old an­i­ma­tion artist Jia He Yi – did not want the book to be a downer.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to build a story arc, to take peo­ple not only through the roller coaster of emo­tion from the ini­tial fear to res­ig­na­tion, but also the epiphany that this is a chance for us to come to­gether as a com­mu­nity to help one an­other.”</p>
    <p>Eko says: “I hope some of the sto­ries res­onate with read­ers – and even give them a few chuck­les – so they feel less alone dur­ing this pandemic.”</p>
