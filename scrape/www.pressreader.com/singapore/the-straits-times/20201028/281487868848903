    <p>The au­to­ma­tion of work through ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI), ro­bot­ics, 3-D print­ing and other new tech­nolo­gies has been a hot topic in re­cent years. But it has now got a sec­ond wind, cour­tesy of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Fu­ture of Jobs 2020 re­port pub­lished last week by the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum (WEF), fa­mous for its an­nual jam­borees of the world’s movers and shak­ers in the Swiss re­sort of Davos, points out that au­to­ma­tion, com­bined with the pan­demic, is cre­at­ing a “dou­ble dis­rup­tion” sce­nario for work­ers.</p>
    <p>Be­sides in­duc­ing a global re­ces­sion that is fu­elling un­em­ploy­ment, Covid-19 has also ac­cel­er­ated com­pa­nies’ plans to au­to­mate work pro­cesses, which could lead to even more job losses.</p>
    <p>In its Oc­to­ber re­gional eco­nomic out­look for the Asia-Pa­cific, which was re­leased last week, the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund (IMF) echoes this broad con­clu­sion, not­ing that the de­ploy­ment of ro­bots and other labour-sav­ing tech­nolo­gies tends to in­crease both af­ter pan­demics and dur­ing re­ces­sions – and we are in both.</p>
    <p>Asian economies are es­pe­cially vul­ner­a­ble, it points out, given that about two-thirds of the world’s op­er­a­tional stocks of in­dus­trial ro­bots are in Asia, and that ro­bot den­sity is ris­ing fast, from a low base in sev­eral Asian economies, many of which have a high de­pen­dence on labour-in­ten­sive man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>Think of the gar­ment in­dus­try in Cam­bo­dia and Bangladesh, or the con­sumer elec­tronic assem­bly plants in Viet­nam and the Philip­pines, or the car fac­to­ries in Thai­land and In­dia, not to men­tion the vast agri­cul­tural sec­tors across the re­gion, which are also vul­ner­a­ble to au­to­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>NOT ALL BAD NEWS</p>
    <p>The news is not all bad, at least in the medium term, ac­cord­ing to the WEF, which es­ti­mates that while 85 mil­lion jobs world­wide will be dis­placed by 2025, 97 mil­lion new roles will emerge. This is con­sis­tent with the usual out­come of tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vances, which have his­tor­i­cally ended up cre­at­ing more jobs than they de­stroyed.</p>
    <p>But the story may be more com­pli­cated this time. There are many un­cer­tain­ties and bumps along the way be­tween now and 2025.</p>
    <p>For one thing, amid the pan­demic, job creation is slow­ing while job de­struc­tion is ac­cel­er­at­ing. Au­to­ma­tion (which will add to job de­struc­tion in the short term) is eas­ier than in the past. For in­stance, AI al­go­rithms can be eas­ily shared and de­ployed. Ro­bots can be quickly in­stalled in ex­ist­ing fac­to­ries. So can 3-D print­ers; no ma­jor new in­fra­struc­ture is re­quired.</p>
    <p>The rise of re­mote work, the de­mand for which is grow­ing dra­mat­i­cally, has cre­ated fur­ther com­pli­ca­tions. The job losses are con­cen­trated in rel­a­tively “high-con­tact” and “non-tele­work­able” in­dus­tries such as hos­pi­tal­ity, re­tail, min­ing, man­u­fac­tur­ing and con­struc­tion. The most af­fected are low-wage, less ed­u­cated work­ers and youth – as well as women, many of whom have been forced to stay at home to man­age child-rear­ing and house­hold re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, es­pe­cially dur­ing lock­downs.</p>
    <p>WIDE SKILL GAPS</p>
    <p>Skill gaps – the dif­fer­ence be­tween the skills that are avail­able and those in de­mand – are high.</p>
    <p>The WEF re­port points out that there is a grow­ing de­mand for skills that in­clude crit­i­cal think­ing and anal­y­sis, prob­lem-solv­ing, self-man­age­ment, re­silience, stress tol­er­ance, creativ­ity, orig­i­nal­ity, the abil­ity to work with peo­ple as well as tech­nol­ogy, man­age­ment and com­mu­ni­ca­tion skills and flex­i­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>The new job open­ings are in ar­eas that in­clude AI, data sci­ence, cloud com­put­ing and the green econ­omy, but also var­i­ous sales jobs, man­age­ment and ad­min­is­tra­tive roles, and jobs in so­cial sec­tors such as health.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the three top roles for which em­ploy­ers need work­ers, ac­cord­ing to the WEF re­port, are data an­a­lysts and sci­en­tists, AI and ma­chine learn­ing ex­perts, and dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion spe­cial­ists.</p>
    <p>Jobs that are be­com­ing in­creas­ingly re­dun­dant as a re­sult of au­to­ma­tion in­clude data en­try clerks, ac­count­ing, book­keep­ing and pay­roll clerks, ad­min­is­tra­tive and ex­ec­u­tive sec­re­taries, and ac­coun­tants and au­di­tors.</p>
    <p>The WEF is not al­to­gether pes­simistic about the ca­pac­ity of dis­placed work­ers to make the tran­si­tion into at least some of the jobs in high de­mand.</p>
    <p>Data from LinkedIn – which the re­port drew upon – in­di­cates that data-re­lated, AI, sales and even some en­gi­neer­ing jobs have not proved dif­fi­cult to break into.</p>
    <p>Data from the re­port also shows that dur­ing the pan­demic, work­ers are al­ready mak­ing job and ca­reer tran­si­tions into un­fa­mil­iar ar­eas. For ex­am­ple, around the world, many work­ers dis­placed from hos­pi­tal­ity, re­tail, food and bev­er­age (F&B) and en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­tries have joined the health sec­tor; re­tail and hos­pi­tal­ity work­ers have be­come bankers, some from higher ed­u­ca­tion have be­come soft­ware en­gi­neers, and F&B work­ers have be­come teach­ers.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, the WEF re­port points out that given the ac­cel­er­ated pace of both job losses and au­to­ma­tion, “the window of op­por­tu­nity to reskill and up­skill work­ers has be­come shorter”.</p>
    <p>GOVERN­MENTS MUST ACT</p>
    <p>There­fore, there is an ur­gency for govern­ments to mon­i­tor the new op­por­tu­ni­ties emerg­ing in labour mar­kets and sup­port the re­train­ing of dis­placed and “at-risk” work­ers, in­clud­ing through vo­ca­tional pro­grammes and on­line train­ing plat­forms.</p>
    <p>The IMF also calls for govern­ments to re­vamp ed­u­ca­tional cur­ric­ula and en­cour­age life­long learn­ing with a view to build­ing more flex­i­ble skill sets.</p>
    <p>Many ob­servers note that Sin­ga­pore has been one of the early movers in all of th­ese ar­eas, hav­ing launched train­ing sub­si­dies and life­long learn­ing ini­tia­tives long be­fore Covid-19.</p>
    <p>But over and above this, both the WEF and the IMF call for an ex­pan­sion of so­cial safety nets to pro­tect the un­em­ployed and to re­duce in­equal­i­ties – there is a high risk that job losses will be far more rapid than job creation, even with the best ef­forts put into reskilling, and in­equal­i­ties are likely to rise.</p>
    <p>This is al­ready ev­i­dent in Sin­ga­pore, where data from the sec­ond-quar­ter Labour Mar­ket Re­port shows that blue-col­lar work­ers have borne the brunt of the lay­offs and fur­loughs.</p>
    <p>The WEF re­port has its lim­i­ta­tions. It is mainly based on feed­back from a few hun­dred large com­pa­nies – the WEF’s cor­po­rate con­stituency. It did not sur­vey small and medium-sized en­ter­prises or firms in the in­for­mal sec­tor, which em­ploy far more peo­ple glob­ally (and also in Sin­ga­pore) and are both more likely to lay off work­ers and less likely to ac­cel­er­ate au­to­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>So its pro­jec­tions of the to­tal num­bers of job dis­place­ments and new op­por­tu­ni­ties are based on a lim­ited sam­ple with a big-com­pany bias.</p>
    <p>UN­RE­LI­ABLE HIS­TORY</p>
    <p>Some econ­o­mists are doubt­ful that the new op­por­tu­ni­ties will nec­es­sar­ily ex­ceed dis­place­ments. Al­though this has been his­tor­i­cally largely true of au­to­ma­tion, it has not al­ways been the case; his­tory is not a re­li­able guide.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, in a re­cent study, econ­o­mists Daron Ace­moglu of the Mas­sachusetts In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy and Pas­cual Restrepo of Bos­ton Univer­sity found that within in­dus­tries adopt­ing au­to­ma­tion in the US, the av­er­age “dis­place­ment” (or job loss) from 1947 to 1987 was 17 per cent of jobs, while av­er­age “new op­por­tu­ni­ties” cre­ated was 19 per cent.</p>
    <p>But from 1987 to 2016, it was a dif­fer­ent story. The dis­place­ment was 16 per cent of jobs, while new op­por­tu­ni­ties rep­re­sented 10 per cent. Not only that, but ben­e­fi­cia­ries of the two sep­a­rate waves of au­to­ma­tion were dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ace­moglu pointed out that tech­no­log­i­cal changes from the 1960s to the 1980s ben­e­fited mainly low-skilled work­ers, but the au­to­ma­tion there­after, and es­pe­cially since the 1990s when ro­bot­ics be­gan to take off, ben­e­fited more high-skilled work­ers, while dis­plac­ing many of those with low skills.</p>
    <p>Higher-skilled work­ers are also likely to be big­ger ben­e­fi­cia­ries of the new wave of AI and soft­ware-driven au­to­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Prof Ace­moglu cau­tions that while many tech­nolo­gies are job dis­plac­ing, they are not nec­es­sar­ily job-cre­at­ing. He gives the ex­am­ple of self-check­out coun­ters at su­per­mar­kets and self-check-in kiosks at air­ports, which he calls “so-so tech­nolo­gies”.</p>
    <p>They re­duce costs for firms a lit­tle bit and dis­place some work­ers (be­cause the cus­tomers do the work) but they don’t in­crease pro­duc­tiv­ity by much, or greatly ben­e­fit other work­ers, or lead to much job creation.</p>
    <p>It is im­por­tant there­fore that com­pa­nies are not en­cour­aged to adopt tech­nolo­gies for tech­nol­ogy’s sake, but to adopt those that are job- and pro­duc­tiv­ity-en­hanc­ing rather than just job-re­plac­ing.</p>
    <p>This is not al­ways easy to pre­dict be­cause later in­no­va­tions can dis­rupt ear­lier in­no­va­tions. For ex­am­ple, the In­ter­net and file trans­fers en­abled ra­di­ol­o­gists to in­ter­pret X-rays re­motely, yield­ing cost sav­ings for hos­pi­tals and clin­ics and new jobs for ra­di­ol­o­gists in re­mote lo­ca­tions. But the later ar­rival of AI – which can in­ter­pret X-rays more ac­cu­rately than hu­mans – dis­in­ter­me­di­ated the re­mote ra­di­ol­o­gists.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, Global Po­si­tion­ing Sys­tem tech­nolo­gies en­abled ride-shar­ing, cre­at­ing jobs for mil­lions of free­lance driv­ers. But au­ton­o­mous ve­hi­cles (in which ride-shar­ing com­pa­nies like Uber are in­vest­ing) will dis­place those driv­ers.</p>
    <p>Even data sci­en­tists and data vi­su­alis­ers, who have been among ben­e­fi­cia­ries of the big data revo­lu­tion, could be dis­placed by ma­chine learn­ing.</p>
    <p>So rapid is the pace of tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vance that which jobs are po­ten­tially at risk can be a tricky co­nun­drum for in­di­vid­u­als, com­pa­nies and pol­i­cy­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>Just as im­por­tant as keep­ing up with the curve of in­no­va­tion will be to train for flex­i­ble skill sets, and to have strong safety nets to pro­tect dis­placed work­ers, be­cause there may be many of them, in sev­eral waves to come.</p>
