    <p>A strange feel­ing set­tled in the Sin­ga­pore shut­tlers as they set foot in Changi Air­port’s un­usu­ally empty de­par­ture hall yes­ter­day for the first time in over 10 months.</p>
    <p>While they were an­tic­i­pat­ing their trip to Bangkok for the Jan 12-17 Yonex Thai­land Open and Jan 19-24 Toy­ota Thai­land Open – their first com­pet­i­tive ac­tion af­ter a Covid-hit sea­son last year – there was also ap­pre­hen­sion at the un­cer­tain times that lay ahead.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore the Thai cap­i­tal wel­comed the sport’s top play­ers, the tour­na­ments were hit by with­drawals, with the Ja­panese team pulling out af­ter world No. 1 Kento Mo­mota tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus on Sun­day. The Chi­nese con­tin­gent, which in­cludes Olympic cham­pion Chen Long and women’s world No. 2 Chen Yufei, are also not trav­el­ling to Bangkok due to China’s virus reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Bad­minton As­so­ci­a­tion of Malaysia coach­ing direc­tor Wong Choong Hann tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 and is in self-iso­la­tion, but Malaysia’s shut­tlers will compete in the two events.</p>
    <p>Na­tional shut­tler Yeo Jia Min, the world No. 26, said: “I feel very ex­cited (to compete again). At the same time, there’ll be quite a lot of things that may be dif­fer­ent and there are a lot of things to be care­ful about.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore the last few days, I didn’t have many con­cerns about go­ing to Bangkok, but af­ter hear­ing that ath­letes are get­ting in­fected, I’ll be very care­ful when I go there.”</p>
    <p>The 21-year-old is among Sin­ga­pore’s con­tin­gent of five, which com­prises men’s sin­gles player Loh Kean Yew, women’s dou­bles pair Crys­tal Wong and Jin Yujia, and sin­gles coach Kelvin Ho.</p>
    <p>Upon ar­rival in Bangkok, they are re­quired to un­dergo a 14-day quar­an­tine and will be al­lowed to train at spe­cific time slots once they test neg­a­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the tour­na­ments, they do</p>
    <p>FIND­ING OUR FEET</p>
    <p>not plan to leave their ho­tel, the Novo­tel Bangkok Im­pact, ex­cept to travel to the tour­na­ment venue at Im­pact Arena, which is a fiveminute drive away. Both com­pe­ti­tions, which are not Olympic qual­i­fy­ing tour­na­ments, will be held be­hind closed doors.</p>
    <p>While the Sin­ga­pore Bad­minton As­so­ci­a­tion has tried to sim­u­late a com­pe­ti­tion en­vi­ron­ment by hold­ing an in­ter­nal tour­na­ment last month, the play­ers ex­pect to have to shake off some rust.</p>
    <p>Jin, 23, whose last com­pe­ti­tion was the Bad­minton Asia Team Cham­pi­onships last Fe­bru­ary, said: “I feel ex­cited to compete again, but at the same time, be­cause we haven’t com­peted in al­most a year, we’ve kind of lost (the feel­ing) of stand­ing in such a big hall and such a high level of com­pe­ti­tion.”</p>
    <p>Crys­tal Wong, 21, added: “I’m look­ing for­ward to see­ing where we stand against other top op­po­nents be­cause dur­ing these few months, we’ve been train­ing quite hard so hope­fully we can see im­prove­ments in our game play.”</p>
    <p>The pair will face Thai­land’s Lak­sika Kan­laha and Ati­taya Po­vanon in the Yonex Thai­land Open, be­fore tak­ing on Den­mark’s Alexan­dra Boje and Mette Poulsen in the next tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>Yeo will face world No. 5 Ratchanok In­tanon, the 2013 world cham­pion whom the Sin­ga­porean has not beaten in two out­ings, in her opener next week, be­fore tak­ing on In­done­sian and world No. 35 Ruselli Hartawan in the first round of the fol­low­ing tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>Team­mate Loh, the world No. 38, is also in for a tough first match against In­done­sia’s world No. 7 Jonatan Christie. But the 23-year-old is rel­ish­ing the chal­lenge, say­ing: “I’m an un­der­dog as com­pared to him. I want to win be­cause af­ter pre­par­ing and not com­pet­ing for so long, I would love to play more rounds.”</p>
    <p>In the first match of the Toy­ota Thai­land Open, Loh will face Thai­land’s Kunlavut Vi­tid­sarn, the world No. 29.</p>
    <p>There is also much at stake this sea­son for Loh and Yeo, who are aim­ing to compete at the Olympic Games in July. But their jour­ney to Tokyo is rid­dled with un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>The top 38 sin­gles play­ers in the men’s and women’s Race to Tokyo rank­ings will qual­ify and while Loh and Yeo are 16th and 17th re­spec­tively, they are un­sure of which tour­na­ments will take place in the last few months of the qual­i­fi­ca­tion win­dow, which closes on May 2.</p>
    <p>Qual­i­fiers for the July 23-Aug 8 Olympics restart on March 2 at the Swiss Open.</p>
    <p>Loh said: “We’re go­ing to play it by ear and see the sit­u­a­tion around the world. If we can, we’ll go to get more Olympic points for qual­i­fi­ca­tion.”</p>
    <p>Be­cause we haven’t com­peted in al­most a year, we’ve kind of lost (the feel­ing) of stand­ing in such a big hall and such a high level of com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
