    <p>The num­ber of lo­cals em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore re­bounded to al­most pre-Covid-19 lev­els in the pe­riod be­tween July and Septem­ber, but the labour mar­ket is not out of the woods yet, with re­trench­ments and un­em­ploy­ment rates con­tin­u­ing to rise. The econ­omy still shed jobs dur­ing this pe­riod, though not as many as in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of lo­cals em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore re­bounded to al­most pre-Covid-19 lev­els in the pe­riod be­tween July and Septem­ber, but the labour mar­ket is not out of the woods yet, with re­trench­ments and un­em­ploy­ment rates con­tin­u­ing to rise.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy still shed jobs dur­ing this pe­riod, though not as many as in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Around 2.34 mil­lion Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents were em­ployed last month, com­pared with 2.29 mil­lion in June, pre­lim­i­nary data re­leased by the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) showed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This was al­most on a par with res­i­dent em­ploy­ment lev­els be­fore the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, as about 2.36 mil­lion lo­cals were em­ployed in De­cem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>But the over­all labour mar­ket re­mains un­cer­tain.</p>
    <p>To­tal em­ploy­ment, ex­clud­ing for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers, con­tin­ued to de­cline in the pe­riod be­tween July and Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Some 26,900 work­ers were shed, largely be­cause the num­ber of non-res­i­dents em­ployed here con­tin­ued to fall. This marked a rel­a­tive re­turn to sta­bil­ity, com­pared with the pre­vi­ous quar­ter, when 103,800 work­ers were shed. Over­all, since the start of the year, the ranks of those in em­ploy­ment have shrunk by 156,400.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment rate con­tin­ued to rise, com­ing in at 4.7 per cent last month, com­pared with 4.6 per cent in Au­gust. The un­em­ploy­ment rate for Sin­ga­pore­ans was 4.9 per cent last month, ris­ing from 4.7 per cent the pre­vi­ous month.</p>
    <p>There were 112,500 un­em­ployed res­i­dents last month, of whom 97,700 were Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>MOM noted that un­em­ploy­ment rates last month were com­pa­ra­ble to pre­vi­ous re­ces­sion­ary highs dur­ing the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis in 1997 and the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis in 2008-2009, but re­mained be­low the peak dur­ing the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome (Sars) out­break in 2003.</p>
    <p>But DBS Bank se­nior econ­o­mist Irvin Seah high­lighted that while the un­em­ploy­ment rates are sim­i­lar to those seen dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, the fis­cal con­di­tions are very dif­fer­ent, es­pe­cially with Sin­ga­pore hav­ing rolled out more than $100 bil­lion of fis­cal stim­u­lus this year, with ini­tia­tives like the Jobs Sup­port Scheme tar­geted at pro­tect­ing jobs.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, re­trench­ments also rose fur­ther in the third quar­ter. A to­tal of 9,100 work­ers were laid off, com­pared with 8,130 in the pre­vi­ous three-month pe­riod.</p>
    <p>This was higher than re­trench­ment num­bers at the peak of pre­vi­ous re­ces­sions, ex­cept for the first quar­ter of 2009 dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis. A to­tal of 12,760 work­ers were cut that quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Lay­offs are ex­pected to in­crease in the man­u­fac­tur­ing and ser­vices sec­tors, and pri­mar­ily in the air trans­port as well as arts, en­ter­tain­ment and recre­ation in­dus­tries for the third quar­ter, MOM said.</p>
    <p>None­the­less, the es­ti­mates sug­gest nascent signs of an im­prove­ment in the labour mar­ket in the third quar­ter, the min­istry noted.</p>
    <p>De­spite over­all de­clines, there was a slow­down in the con­trac­tion of to­tal em­ploy­ment rates.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo, while cau­tious about the prospects for the job mar­ket, said that she was “qui­etly re­lieved” by the es­ti­mates.</p>
    <p>“The ship has sta­bilised, but we need to put in the ef­fort to keep sail­ing to­wards the des­ti­na­tion... which is to sus­tain lo­cal em­ploy­ment to where it was pre­vi­ously. That is some­thing that we should have to work very hard to­wards.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s labour mar­ket showed signs of im­prove­ment in the third quar­ter but the over­all pic­ture re­mains gloomy amid the on­go­ing Covid-19 pan­demic, econ­o­mists said.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary data re­leased by the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) yes­ter­day showed that to­tal em­ploy­ment con­tin­ued to con­tract, as re­trench­ments and un­em­ploy­ment rates rose in the July to Septem­ber pe­riod.</p>
    <p>But there is a sil­ver lin­ing as over­all em­ploy­ment de­clined at a slower pace. Sim­i­larly, the i ncrease in un­em­ploy­ment rates and re­trench­ments com­pared with pre­vi­ous months was more muted.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank’s head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy Se­lena Ling said the jump in over­all and res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment rates was as ex­pected, and the rates could creep up fur­ther in the fourth quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment rate came in at 4.7 per cent last month, while the over­all un­em­ploy­ment rate was 3.6 per cent.</p>
    <p>“The pace of re­trench­ments will hope­fully sta­bilise, but the j ob prospects still very much de­pend on the global Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion and vac­cine devel­op­ments,” Ms Ling said.</p>
    <p>May­bank Kim Eng se­nior econ­o­mist Chua Hak Bin said: “The Govern­ment’s gen­er­ous wage sub­si­dies and hir­ing in­cen­tives have cush­ioned the im­pact on lo­cals.”</p>
    <p>While the job mar­ket is on the mend, the re­cov­ery will be slow, he said, not­ing that em­ploy­ment will likely re­cover to pre-pan­demic lev­els only in 2022 or even 2023.</p>
    <p>Dr Chua said the re­cent i ncreases in the qual­i­fy­ing salaries for Em­ploy­ment Pass and work pass hold­ers will likely dampen and slow the em­ploy­ment re­cov­ery for non-lo­cals.</p>
    <p>“The hir­ing of for­eign­ers will likely pick up pace only when the pool of avail­able lo­cals tightens.”</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, OCBC’s Ms Ling said there may be a limit to how far non­res­i­dent em­ploy­ment can bear the brunt of the im­pact of Covid-19 with­out af­fect­ing the com­pet­i­tive­ness of the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy.</p>
    <p>On the prospects ahead, Ms Ling said: “It is a trade-off be­tween the ramp­ing up in eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties, es­pe­cially for con­struc­tion and do­mes­tic ser­vices once we shift to phase three, and the tick­ing clock for the var­i­ous sup­port schemes, such as the Jobs Sup­port Scheme, which will taper off for se­lected in­dus­tries go­ing into 2021.”</p>
    <p>Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral and labour MP Pa­trick Tay em­pha­sised the un­cer­tainty ahead in a Face­book post yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“I ex­pect both the re­trench­ment and un­em­ploy­ment fig­ures will con­tinue to stay high in the fourth quar­ter, as longer-term re­cov­ery is ex­pected to be pro­tracted against the con­tin­ued re­stric­tions in travel ac­tiv­ity, on­go­ing Covid-19 safe man­age­ment mea­sures and re­stric­tions, as well as an over­all un­cer­tain lo­cal/global out­look and stance across many in­dus­tries, with coun­tries en­coun­ter­ing sec­ond and third waves of out­break.”</p>
    <p>Fel­low labour MP Des­mond Choo, who is also NTUC as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral, said in his Face­book post that ris­ing re­trench­ments in the third quar­ter are a con­cern, and the tri­par­tite part­ners are work­ing closely to sup­port re­trenched work­ers and job seek­ers and help them find new jobs more quickly.</p>
    <p>He en­cour­aged com­pa­nies that are per­form­ing well to re­ward work­ers fairly, while urg­ing af­fected firms to tap cost-sav­ing mea­sures to re­duce job losses and the Jobs Growth In­cen­tive to in­crease hir­ing.</p>
    <p>In its re­port, MOM noted that salary and head­count re­duc­tions could sub­side in the months ahead as busi­ness sen­ti­ments and eco­nomic con­di­tions im­prove.</p>
    <p>A poll of com­pa­nies in Septem­ber showed that the pro­por­tion of firms in­di­cat­ing that they in­tended to cut salaries or head­count has been on a down­trend since May. At the same time, more com­pa­nies plan to hire in Septem­ber com­pared with pre­vi­ous months.</p>
    <p>The pace of re­trench­ments will hope­fully sta­bilise, but the job prospects still very much de­pend on the global Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion and vac­cine devel­op­ments.</p>
