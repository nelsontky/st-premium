    <p>There have been no Covid-19 pa­tients at the in­ten­sive care unit at the Na­tional Cen­tre For In­fec­tious Dis­eases (NCID) since June 15.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Tan Hui Ling is pray­ing hard it will con­tinue to re­main empty.</p>
    <p>“I hope that peo­ple will be re­spon­si­ble so that there are no new waves of in­fec­tions. You do not want to end up in the ICU be­cause of Covid-19. It’s a very hor­ri­ble ex­pe­ri­ence,” says the se­nior con­sul­tant in the de­part­ment of anaes­the­si­ol­ogy, in­ten­sive care and pain medicine at Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal (TTSH).</p>
    <p>Dr Tan, 50, says: “Many can’t breathe. To help them breathe, we put a tube down their voice box, and when they wake up, it can be a very scary thing if they’re not pre­pared for it be­cause they can’t talk.</p>
    <p>“Some­times we have to put a line in the neck, and another in the ar­ter­ies. These are all pro­ce­dures which can have com­pli­ca­tions.”</p>
    <p>Crit­i­cally ill Covid-19 pa­tients are of­ten se­dated and paral­ysed to pre­vent them from mov­ing, she adds.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan is chair­man of the hos­pi­tal’s ICU com­mit­tee and played a key role in get­ting the in­ten­sive care unit at TTSH-NCID Covid-19 ready.</p>
    <p>For the last six months, she has been beaver­ing along­side other frontline health work­ers in the ward to save the lives of scores of pa­tients de­bil­i­tated by the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome coro­n­avirus 2 (Sars-CoV2) – the virus that causes Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The symp­toms of the dis­ease – which has in­fected more than 15 mil­lion and killed more than 600,000 world­wide since rear­ing its ugly head late last year – vary.</p>
    <p>While most peo­ple dis­play mild or even no symp­toms, many oth­ers – es­pe­cially those who have un­der­ly­ing med­i­cal con­di­tions – can end up in the ICU fight­ing for their lives as they bat­tle, among other af­flic­tions, res­pi­ra­tory fail­ure, sep­tic shock and mul­ti­ple or­gan dys­func­tion or fail­ure.</p>
    <p>Just ask Mr Wong Shin Liang, 71, who was hos­pi­talised for nearly 70 days, and warded in the ICU three times af­ter be­ing di­ag­nosed with the coro­n­avirus in early Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Among other com­pli­ca­tions, the di­a­betic had pneu­mo­nia, needed to be put on a ven­ti­la­tor and suf­fered se­vere in­testi­nal bleed­ing.</p>
    <p>His daugh­ter, Ms E.H. Wong, says: “He had many bags of blood trans­fu­sions.”</p>
    <p>LAST LINE OF DE­FENCE</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases (NCID) – which took over the func­tions of TTSH’s for­mer Com­mu­ni­ca­ble Dis­ease Cen­tre last year – be­came the des­ig­nated ground zero for Sin­ga­pore’s re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus when it sur­faced here in late Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>The self-con­tained fa­cil­ity can be locked down to man­age highly in­fec­tious agents dur­ing a big out­break. The coun­try’s largest screen­ing cen­tre – run by TTSH’s Emer­gency De­part­ment and ca­pa­ble of screen­ing nearly 300 cases daily – was set up at the fa­cil­ity. NCID’s res­i­dent ICU was prepped and equipped to deal with the virus too.</p>
    <p>If the screen­ing cen­tre is the first line of de­fence in the fight against Covid-19, then the ICU is the last. Here, health­care work­ers make crit­i­cal de­ci­sions daily to save a more vul­ner­a­ble group of pa­tients de­bil­i­tated by the virus while en­sur­ing that more crit­i­cal care is read­ily avail­able as the sit­u­a­tion evolves.</p>
    <p>Prepa­ra­tions to get the ICU Covid-19 ready be­gan in earnest around Chi­nese New Year. The pa­tients who were there were moved to TTSH’s reg­u­lar ICU, the space was ex­panded and the num­ber of beds in­creased from 10 to 38.</p>
    <p>The unit’s di­rec­tor Ben­jamin Ho says: “We heard that in China (the coro­n­avirus pa­tients) were not go­ing to nor­mal wards but the ICU.”</p>
    <p>The unit re­ceived its first two pa­tients on Feb 5. Since then, scores have been warded and treated at the unit, in­clud­ing Mr Wong and Bangladesh­i mi­grant worker Raju Sarker (Pa­tient No 42) who fought for his life and was dis­charged five months af­ter con­tract­ing the virus. There have been 15 deaths from Covid-19 at TTSH-NCID.</p>
    <p>At its busiest, more than half of the beds in the ICU were oc­cu­pied.</p>
    <p>The ICU is manned by spe­cial­ists and doc­tors from var­i­ous de­part­ments. As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ling Limin, a se­nior in­fec­tious dis­eases con­sul­tant at NCID, says: “We have car­di­ol­o­gists, neu­rol­o­gists and in­ten­sivists, we are re­ally multi-dis­ci­plinary.”</p>
    <p>To cope with the pan­demic the ICU med­i­cal team was beefed up three­fold, with de­ploy­ments from dif­fer­ent de­part­ments in TTSH.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the 75 ICU nurses at NCID were aug­mented not just by their peers at TTSH but also 33 ICU nurses from other pub­lic health­care in­sti­tu­tions at end-March.</p>
    <p>Nurse man­ager Lor­raine Tan says her ICU staff come from dif­fer­ent train­ing back­grounds. “As the NCID ICU ad­mits pa­tients from all dis­ci­plines, the chal­lenge lies in en­sur­ing ver­sa­til­ity in the daily man­power al­lo­ca­tion to match the type of nurs­ing care needed.”</p>
    <p>CHAL­LENGES</p>
    <p>Fight­ing the beast that is Covid-19 is fraught with chal­lenges, not least be­cause the dis­ease is new. To be­gin with, weed­ing out sus­pected from ac­tual Covid-19 cases was no walk in the park.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan says: “We had a sit­u­a­tion where if any­one be­came crit­i­cally ill, we had to ask our­selves if he or she was ill with Covid or had a stroke and had Covid at the same</p>
    <p>time? If the pa­tient came in with a heart at­tack, was it re­lated to the Covid? It was a het­ero­ge­neous group. In nor­mal times, they would have just gone to nor­mal pa­tient ICU. But we had to be very care­ful not to start a clus­ter if we sent them to the gen­eral ward.”</p>
    <p>Putting on the per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment (PPE) takes at least 10 min­utes. To avoid de­gown­ing, many frontline health­care work­ers train their blad­ders or avoid drink­ing too much wa­ter so that they do not have to go for toi­let breaks.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan points out: “It is re­ally im­por­tant to put the PPE on cor­rectly be­cause pa­tients will cough and you can­not tell them not to. You also can­not take three steps back when they do, be­cause it will be very bad for pa­tient morale. In the course of care, you want to con­nect with the pa­tient.</p>
    <p>“When we go in, if the pa­tient can talk, we talk. If they can’t, the first thing we do is to hold their hand.”</p>
    <p>The un­wieldy pro­tec­tive gear also makes the del­i­cate job of han­dling se­verely ill pa­tients more dif­fi­cult. For ex­am­ple, turn­ing an in­tu­bated pa­tient prone – to im­prove oxy­gena­tion – can take half an hour, since the dif­fer­ent life-sus­tain­ing lines are con­nected.</p>
    <p>The sheer in­fec­tious­ness of the dis­ease also means the med­i­cal team have to think through their move­ments to re­duce ex­po­sure.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, if we need to ex­am­ine a pa­tient, we have to de­cide who is the most suitable to do it and what you need to ex­am­ine,” Dr Tan says.</p>
    <p>Dr Ling re­mem­bers see­ing an ex­hausted col­league early one morn­ing. “He looked so spent. That’s be­cause he’d spent the whole night keep­ing Raju alive,” she says re­fer­ring to the Bangladesh­i mi­grant worker who spent five months in NCID and TTSH.</p>
    <p>She says: “We thought he’d be the first to go; he had every­thing you could think of – from sep­sis to fun­gus in the blood.”</p>
    <p>EMO­TIONAL SUP­PORT</p>
    <p>Treat­ing Covid pa­tients is not just phys­i­cally tax­ing, it is also emo­tion­ally drain­ing.</p>
    <p>Dr Ho Lai Peng, prin­ci­pal med­i­cal so­cial worker, spot­ted a need to help the fam­i­lies of Covid-19 pa­tients in the ICU whose vis­its are highly re­stricted to keep the virus from spread­ing.</p>
    <p>While sen­si­ble, this step can be hard for a pa­tient’s fam­ily to take, says Dr Ling.</p>
    <p>“Even if a pa­tient can­not hear, it’s good for loved ones to see them. They feel they are do­ing some­thing and it can help to re­duce help­less­ness.”</p>
    <p>But now, that is no longer pos­si­ble. “Lai Peng’s role helped us to think about what fam­i­lies and next of kin were think­ing about and how we can as­sure them,” she says.</p>
    <p>Dr Ho says that many of the calls she makes to the loved ones – es­pe­cially those un­der quar­an­tine or serv­ing Stay Home No­tice – of pa­tients in­evitably end up in tears.</p>
    <p>“I have another col­league do­ing this with me. We do what­ever we can to ease their anx­i­ety. It means a lot to them that some­one from the hos­pi­tal is lis­ten­ing to their pain and sad­ness,” says the so­cial worker who even ar­ranged Zoom calls for fam­i­lies to keep vigil over their loved ones.</p>
    <p>The tough­est part, she says, is help­ing them cope with pa­tients who do not make it.</p>
    <p>“You have to let them know that when the pa­tient dies, they won’t be able to see him or her any­more. The pa­tient has to be dou­ble­bagged and put in a closed cas­ket,” she says, re­fer­ring to pro­to­cols on the han­dling of fa­tal­i­ties from the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Dr Ho has seen seven deaths in the NCID ICU over the past six months. One of the hard­est things she had to do was help­ing an el­derly wo­man – also a Covid-19 pa­tient – cope with the death of her hus­band.</p>
    <p>“When he was dy­ing in the ICU, we ar­ranged a video call for her and their only son, who was over­seas. She was griev­ing so badly. She had known the hus­band since she was 15 and he was her best friend and now he’s gone. I had to help her claim his body from the morgue and ar­range the fu­neral. The un­der­taker did a live video so that their son could say good­bye vir­tu­ally to his fa­ther.”</p>
    <p>Thank­fully, most pa­tients in the ICU had hap­pier and bet­ter out­comes, with some, like Mr Raju and Mr Wong, pulling off mirac­u­lous re­cov­er­ies.</p>
    <p>Dr Ling re­calls: “The mood of the ICU re­ally turned when Mr Raju’s kid­ney func­tion im­proved and his blood pres­sure sta­bilised. It was a tri­umph.”</p>
    <p>Ms Au­drey Lee re­mem­bers Mr Wong well. The 29-year-old se­nior phys­io­ther­a­pist is part of a small team of car­diopul­monary phys­io­ther­a­pists de­ployed to work with Covid-19 pa­tients in the ICU.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong was the first coro­n­avirus pa­tient she worked with, and was quite dif­fer­ent from other pa­tients she was used to see­ing.</p>
    <p>“What­ever in­for­ma­tion on work­ing with Covid-19 pa­tients we had at that time came from China. It was only af­ter work­ing with him that of­fi­cial guide­lines came out but we were not far off.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, she says, could not sit up­right and needed a ven­ti­la­tor to breathe. She adds: “He was very anx­ious that he could not come off the oxy­gen, and anx­i­ety con­trib­utes to breath­less­ness. We had to use every­thing in our book to not only re­ha­bil­i­tate him but help him with his emo­tions as well.”</p>
    <p>All ICU frontline work­ers in­ter­viewed agree that the past six months have been gru­elling.</p>
    <p>But in band­ing to­gether to save lives, they also now share a new level of in­ti­macy and in­ten­sity, says Dr Tan. “Ev­ery­one is work­ing and think­ing about cases. I get mes­sages at mid­night ask­ing if I have read this or that pa­per, peo­ple are shar­ing in­for­ma­tion about every­thing from clot­ting to di­a­betes be­cause of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“It has brought ev­ery­one to­gether.”</p>
