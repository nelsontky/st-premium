    <p>NEW YORK • Moderna and Pfizer have launched two 30,000-sub­ject tri­als of Covid-19 vac­cines that could clear the way for reg­u­la­tory ap­proval and wide­spread use by the end of this year.</p>
    <p>The tri­als, an­nounced on Mon­day, are the first late-stage stud­ies sup­ported by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s ef­fort to speed devel­op­ment of mea­sures against the coro­n­avirus, adding to hope that an ef­fec­tive vac­cine will help end the spread­ing pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Moderna stock rose 9 per cent on the news. Pfizer shares rose 1.6 per cent in af­ter-hours trade and its part­ner BioN­Tech, which de­vel­oped the vac­cine, was up 4.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>Both vac­cine can­di­dates rely on a new tech­nol­ogy that al­lows for faster devel­op­ment and man­u­fac­tur­ing than tra­di­tional vac­cine pro­duc­tion meth­ods but does not have an ex­ten­sive track record.</p>
    <p>So-called mRNA, or syn­thetic mes­sen­ger RNA (mRNA), teaches the im­mune sys­tem to recog­nise and neu­tralise the coro­n­avirus by mim­ick­ing its sur­face.</p>
    <p>Moderna, which has never brought a vac­cine to mar­ket, has re­ceived nearly US$1 bil­lion (S$1.4 bil­lion) from the US gov­ern­ment, which is help­ing to bankroll sev­eral vac­cine can­di­dates un­der its Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Pfizer has an agree­ment to sell vac­cines for 50 mil­lion peo­ple to the US gov­ern­ment for around US$2 bil­lion, if the vac­cine is ef­fec­tive. More than 150 coro­n­avirus vac­cine can­di­dates are i n var­i­ous stages of devel­op­ment, with some two dozen prospects al­ready con­duct­ing hu­man test­ing.</p>
    <p>John­son and John­son is launch­ing clinical tri­als in the United States this week and could start a larger, late-stage trial as early as Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish drug­maker As­traZeneca has said it will be­gin large-scale US tri­als this sum­mer of its vac­cine un­der devel­op­ment with Ox­ford Univer­sity re­searchers.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing a safe and ef­fec­tive vac­cine dis­trib­uted by the end of 2020 is a stretch goal, but it’s the right goal for the Amer­i­can peo­ple,” Na­tional In­sti­tutes of Health (NIH) di­rec­tor Fran­cis Collins said in a re­lease an­nounc­ing the start of Moderna’s large Phase III trial.</p>
    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ers are ramp­ing up pro­duc­tion while test­ing is un­der way in or­der to re­spond as soon as pos­si­ble to the virus, which is still spread­ing rapidly. Covid-19 has killed nearly 650,000 peo­ple world­wide and bat­tered economies.</p>
    <p>Moderna could have tens of mil­lions of doses ready when and if the vac­cine is deemed safe and ef­fec­tive, Mr Collins told re­porters.</p>
    <p>Pfizer said that if the trial was suc­cess­ful, it could seek reg­u­la­tory ap­proval as soon as Oc­to­ber and sup­ply vac­cines for 50 mil­lion pa­tients, at two doses each, by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>Pfizer is aim­ing for about 1.3 bil­lion doses by the end of next year, and Moderna is tar­get­ing for 500 mil­lion to 1 bil­lion doses a year, be­gin­ning next year, said its chief ex­ec­u­tive Stephane Ban­cel.</p>
    <p>The late-stage tri­als are de­signed to eval­u­ate the safety of vac­cines and de­ter­mine if they can pre­vent symp­to­matic Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Dr An­thony Fauci, the top US in­fec­tious dis­ease of­fi­cial, has said a read-out from the Moderna trial could come by Novem­ber or even ear­lier. Dr Fauci said he was “not par­tic­u­larly con­cerned” about the vac­cine’s safety af­ter see­ing data from ear­lier, smaller tri­als.</p>
    <p>He also said he had briefed Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump about the trial on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Covid-19 Preven­tion Net­work, a US gov­ern­ment­funded pro­gramme formed by the NIH, said it plans to roll out a largescale clinical trial of a coro­n­avirus vac­cine can­di­date with at least 30,000 par­tic­i­pants each month through au­tumn.</p>
