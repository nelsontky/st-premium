    <p>The gen­eral man­ager of a com­pany wrong­fully con­fined three for­eign work­ers in a room for 42 days over May and June amid the Covid-19 out­break, with one stretch run­ning 39 days straight.</p>
    <p>The work­ers from in­te­grated me­chan­i­cal engi­neer­ing ser­vice provider Ad-Meth Mech Field were locked in a 3.4m-by-4.3m room, which is slightly larger than a bed­room in a Hous­ing Board flat.</p>
    <p>The room is lo­cated on the com­pany’s premises in Tuas.</p>
    <p>Con­struc­tion work­ers Pandiyan Jayakan­than, 23, and Gane­san Pandi, 24; and con­struc­tion su­per­vi­sor Muthu­raj Thangaraj, 39, had ac­cess to only one bath­room.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, their for­mer boss – Sin­ga­porean Shaun Pang Tong Heng, 41 – was fined $9,000 af­ter he pleaded guilty to three counts of wrong­ful con­fine­ment.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Pang felt that the trio were “trou­ble­mak­ers”.</p>
    <p>He found out on May 12 that Mr Pandiyan and Mr Gane­san had been both­er­ing an­other worker in the firm. Pang was also sep­a­rately aware that Mr Muthu­raj was un­der po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tion for an un­re­lated mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The men were ini­tially let out on May 15 af­ter they com­plained that the con­fined area was warm and had mos­qui­toes.</p>
    <p>They were then moved to an­other room which had three beds and air-con­di­tion­ing. It was also not locked.</p>
    <p>But on May 18, Pang viewed a video clip which showed Mr Pandiyan and Mr Gane­san leav­ing the com­pany’s premises.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor Eric Hu said: “The ac­cused deemed that the vic­tims were unremorsef­ul and thus de­cided to con­fine the three vic­tims back in the con­fined area.”</p>
    <p>Pang then asked one of the firm’s su­per­vi­sors to lock the men up. Pang also told the trio that he could call the po­lice on them if they did</p>
    <p>VIC­TIMS DEEMED UNREMORSEF­UL</p>
    <p>The ac­cused deemed that the vic­tims were unremorsef­ul and thus de­cided to con­fine the three vic­tims back in the con­fined ’’ area.</p>
    <p>DEPUTY PUB­LIC PROSE­CU­TOR ERIC HU</p>
    <p>not com­ply.</p>
    <p>The trio were sent back to the first room and held from May 19 to June 26. They had their mo­bile phones with them and were given three meals daily. The main room had three beds, fans, a wa­ter cooler and Wi-Fi con­nec­tion.</p>
    <p>On June 25, one of the men used his mo­bile phone to alert the Min­istry of Man­power, and a group of its of­fi­cers ar­rived at the scene the next day.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cers in­structed Pang to re­lease the trio im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>Mr Ad­naan, the de­fence lawyer rep­re­sent­ing Pang, told District Judge Prem Raj yes­ter­day that his client is re­morse­ful.</p>
    <p>The lawyer said that dur­ing the out­break, Mr Pandiyan and Mr Gane­san had left their place of res­i­dence to buy al­co­hol de­spite be­ing housed near a Covid-19 clus­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Ad­naan added that Mr Pandiyan also drove a com­pany lorry even though he had no li­cence to do so. As for Mr Muthu­raj, the lawyer said he was pre­vi­ously caught for drink driv­ing.</p>
    <p>DPP Hu, how­ever, replied that there was no ex­cuse for Pang to take mat­ters into his own hands.</p>
    <p>Be­fore hand­ing out the sen­tence, the judge said that Pang should have no­ti­fied the po­lice about the work­ers.</p>
