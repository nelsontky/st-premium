    <p>• Ja­pan’s job­less rate rose in Au­gust to its high­est in over three years and job avail­abil­ity fell to a more than six-year low, gov­ern­ment data showed yes­ter­day, in­di­cat­ing dam­age caused by the Covid-19 pan­demic per­sisted through the month.</p>
    <p>The fig­ures come af­ter new Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga pledged to pro­tect jobs, keep com­pa­nies in business and help the econ­omy re­cover from the im­pact of mea­sures taken to curb the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>They also dull any op­ti­mism brought by re­cent data such as fac­tory out­put and business sen­ti­ment that of­fered signs of eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment’s spe­cial em­ploy­ment sub­sidy to sup­port firms hit by the coro­n­avirus has helped to rein in the job­less rate, which could have risen much higher,” said chief econ­o­mist At­sushi Takeda at Itochu Re­search In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple have started to seek jobs but the labour mar­ket is not strong enough to ab­sorb them. The pace of re­cov­ery in the jobs mar­ket is likely to slow and the un­em­ploy­ment rate could rise fur­ther.”</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s sea­son­ally ad­justed job­less rate rose to 3 per cent in Au­gust, the high­est since May 2017, Labour Min­istry data showed. The re­sult met an­a­lysts’ me­dian forecast of 3 per cent.</p>
    <p>The data showed about 2.06 mil­lion peo­ple lost their jobs in Au­gust, 490,000 more than in the same month a year ear­lier, and mark­ing the sev­enth con­sec­u­tive month of in­crease.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with the pre­vi­ous month, how­ever, the num­ber of em­ployed work­ers rose by 110,000 in sea­son­ally ad­justed terms – the fourth straight month of gain.</p>
    <p>The jobs-to-ap­pli­cants ra­tio fell to 1.04, match­ing a level last seen in Jan­uary 2014. It com­pared with 1.08 in July, and a me­dian forecast of 1.05.</p>
