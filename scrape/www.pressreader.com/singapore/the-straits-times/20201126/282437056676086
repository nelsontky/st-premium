    <p>WELLING­TON • New In­ter­na­tional Cricket Coun­cil (ICC) chair­man Greg Bar­clay yes­ter­day said his or­gan­i­sa­tion must de­liver its pin­na­cle events over the next three years or there will be se­ri­ous fi­nan­cial con­se­quences for the sport.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has forced the ICC to resched­ule three of its world tour­na­ments, in­clud­ing this year’s men’s T20 World Cup, to next Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Bar­clay, who was con­firmed as chair­man of the world gov­ern­ing body on Tues­day, said it was con­tracted to de­liver them within the cur­rent broad­cast­ing agree­ment, fail­ing which there would be se­ri­ous fi­nan­cial con­se­quences.</p>
    <p>“We have got to de­liver the world events that are to come and those that are post­poned,” the New Zealan­der said of the agree­ments that ex­pire in mid-2023.</p>
    <p>“Not just for the crick­et­ing out­comes but there are com­mer­cial con­cerns as well.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides the men’s Twenty20 World Cup, which will still be held in Aus­tralia, and the next women’s World Cup, which has been moved to 2022, the men’s 2023 World Cup in In­dia has also been pushed back from Fe­bru­ary and March to Oc­to­ber and Novem­ber that year.</p>
    <p>“If we fail to de­liver all of those events, then we will be pe­nalised by the broad­cast­ers and we won’t re­ceive the last of the on­go­ing pay­ments,” added Bar­clay.</p>
    <p>“That, in turn, is go­ing to af­fect the ICC’s abil­ity to in­vest in its own pro­grammes and en­able it to make dis­tri­bu­tions to mem­bers. Un­for­tu­nately, a lot of the ICC mem­bers are heav­ily re­liant on those dis­burse­ments.”</p>
    <p>Bar­clay has re­placed i nterim chair­man Im­ran Kh­waja, who tem­po­rar­ily took over from In­dian Shashank Manohar af­ter his sec­ond two-year term ended in July.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean Im­ran, who is also a part­ner at law firm Tan Ra­jah & Cheah, had been deputy chair­man of the ICC since 2017 and was the for­mer Sin­ga­pore Cricket As­so­ci­a­tion pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Bar­clay, who has served as New Zealand Cricket’s rep­re­sen­ta­tive on the ICC board for the last six years, has stepped down from that role to lead the global body.</p>
    <p>The com­mer­cial lawyer said that while the elec­tion process had been “drawn out”, he was keen to get to work. One of his tasks is to en­sure women’s cricket con­tin­ues to “move to­wards par­ity” amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He is also ea­ger to de­velop the game in non-tra­di­tional markets and be­lieves the United States is an area it can tap into.</p>
    <p>“We have to look at re­gions where there is good po­ten­tial for growth,” he said. “The US ap­pears to be the place to go. It has a mas­sive ad­van­tage in its tra­di­tional au­di­ences from sub-con­ti­nen­tal Asia. We should con­tinue with that.”</p>
    <p>FI­NAN­CIAL PENAL­TIES</p>
    <p>If we fail to de­liver all of those events, then we will be pe­nalised by the broad­cast­ers and we won’t re­ceive the last of the on­go­ing</p>
    <p>pay­ments.</p>
