    <p>CHICAGO • Fi­nal data from Gilead Sciences’ an­tivi­ral drug remde­sivir showed the treat­ment cut Covid-19 re­cov­ery time by five days, com­pared with pa­tients who re­ceived a placebo – one day faster than in­di­cated in pre­lim­i­nary data, the com­pany and re­searchers said on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>In pa­tients who were on oxy­gen when they first re­ceived the drug, remde­sivir – which is sold un­der the brand Vek­lury – re­duced re­cov­ery time by seven days com­pared with a placebo af­ter 29 days, ac­cord­ing to the 1,062-pa­tient study pub­lished in the New Eng­land Jour­nal of Medicine.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal study looked at data at 29 days of treat­ment, ver­sus a pre­lim­i­nary study re­leased in May that re­ported re­sults af­ter 15 days.</p>
    <p>Gilead’s drug was among the first used as a treat­ment for the novel coro­n­avirus, and was one of the drugs re­cently used to treat US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s in­fec­tion. It re­ceived emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion from the United States’ Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion on May 1, and has since been au­tho­rised for use in sev­eral other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Re­sults of the over­all study sug­gested the drug may re­duce mor­tal­ity, but the ben­e­fit was not sta­tis­ti­cally sig­nif­i­cant.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate analysis look­ing just at pa­tients who re­ceived oxy­gen, how­ever, the drug ap­peared to re­duce the risk of death by 72 per cent at day 15, and 70 per cent at day 29.</p>
    <p>With this analysis, “we now have data sug­gest­ing that giv­ing remde­sivir to pa­tients on oxy­gen may sig­nif­i­cantly re­duce their chances of death com­pared with other sub­groups”, Dr An­dre Kalil, an in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert at the Univer­sity of Ne­braska Med­i­cal Cen­tre and the study’s prin­ci­pal in­ves­ti­ga­tor, said.</p>
