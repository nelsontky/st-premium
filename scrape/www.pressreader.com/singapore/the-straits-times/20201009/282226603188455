    <p>The par­ent of Malaysia Air­lines has warned leas­ing firms that state fund Khaz­anah will stop fund­ing the group and force it into a wind­ing down process if re­struc­tur­ing talks with lessors are un­suc­cess­ful, ac­cord­ing to a let­ter seen by Reuters.</p>
    <p>The warn­ing from Malaysia Avi­a­tion Group (MAG), the hold­ing com­pany for the state car­rier, raises the stakes in ne­go­ti­a­tions for a fi­nan­cial shake-up known as “Plan A” and sets out an al­ter­na­tive plan to di­vert funds to sis­ter air­line unit Fire­fly.</p>
    <p>“In the event Plan A fails, share­holder (Khaz­anah) will cease fund­ing for MAG and will trig­ger wind­ing down/liq­ui­da­tion process for MAG,” ac­cord­ing to the doc­u­ment, the con­tents of which were con­firmed by six peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Khaz­anah, MAG’s sole share­holder, de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>Fi­nance Min­is­ter Tengku Zafrul Ab­dul Aziz said in a ra­dio in­ter­view yes­ter­day that the gov­ern­ment would not pro­vide fi­nan­cial re­lief or debt guar­an­tees to the air­line.</p>
    <p>When asked whether the gov­ern­ment would close down the air­line, he said: “That is up to Khaz­anah as the share­holder of Malaysia Air­lines. I have never ever said to close down Malaysia Air­lines.”</p>
    <p>In an e-mail re­sponse to Reuters on Wed­nes­day, MAG said it will “de­pict its fi­nal po­si­tion upon achiev­ing res­o­lu­tion with the par­ties it is ne­go­ti­at­ing with”. It said the re­struc­tur</p>
    <p>ing plan was a cru­cial step for it to come out as a “sus­tain­able and prof­itable or­gan­i­sa­tion in fu­ture”.</p>
    <p>MAG’s com­ments in the let­ter seen by Reuters came days af­ter the air­line group asked lessors, in a let­ter, for steep dis­counts on air­craft rentals as part of a broad re­struc­tur­ing plan, some of the sources said.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the lat­est doc­u­ment, un­der a “Plan B” sce­nario, Khaz­anah would “in­ject funds into Fire­fly di­rectly to start new jet oper­a­tions in Kuala Lumpur on a much smaller scale, fo­cus­ing first on do­mes­tic ser­vices”.</p>
    <p>Low-cost car­rier Fire­fly, which op­er­ates a fleet of 12 twin tur­bo­props, mainly within the coun­try, is cur­rently a fully owned sub­sidiary of MAG. Ac­cord­ing to the doc­u­ment, Fire­fly would ob­tain nar­row­body planes and sub­se­quently wide-body air­craft from the mar­ket in the “Plan B” sce­nario.</p>
    <p>PRE­VI­OUS RE­STRUC­TUR­ING</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s na­tional air­line has strug</p>
    <p>gled to re­cover from two tragedies in 2014 – the dis­ap­pear­ance of Flight MH370 and the shoot­ing down of Flight MH17 over Ukraine.</p>
    <p>Khaz­anah took it pri­vate that year as part of a US$1.5 bil­lion re­struc­tur­ing, but ef­forts to turn around the business have been fur­ther up­ended by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Since last year, Malaysia has been look­ing for a strate­gic part­ner for its air­line, which has been be­set by high costs and a bloated work­force.</p>
    <p>The car­rier has a to­tal fleet of 88 planes, of which 25 are in stor­age, ac­cord­ing to data from Cir­ium, an avi­a­tion an­a­lyt­ics com­pany.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Malaysia’s AirAsia X, the long-haul arm of AirAsia Group, Malaysia Air­lines’ com­peti­tor, said it needed to re­struc­ture US$15.3 bil­lion (S$20.8 bil­lion) of debt to stave off liq­ui­da­tion.</p>
    <p>Sources who de­clined to be iden­ti­fied said Malaysia Air­lines is ne­go­ti­at­ing dis­counts with lessors via a re­struc­tur­ing plan it is seek­ing to im­ple­ment via a Bri­tish court process.</p>
    <p>Lessors had been given an Oct 7 dead­line to re­spond to MAG, but sources said lessors were also ex­plor­ing bi­lat­eral ne­go­ti­a­tions with the avi­a­tion group.</p>
    <p>Khaz­anah told Reuters last week it was sup­port­ive of Malaysia Air­lines’ re­struc­tur­ing ef­forts but if they proved un­suc­cess­ful, it would need to eval­u­ate op­tions on how to main­tain con­nec­tiv­ity for Malaysia.</p>
