    <p>It used to be that the Mercedes­Benz E-class was for old-school busi­ness own­ers, and the BMW 5-se­ries was for tech-hun­gry yup­pies.</p>
    <p>But the lines have been blurred over the years and the facelifted 5-se­ries blurs it fur­ther.</p>
    <p>The re­vised 5 does not have as many new tech toys as the facelifted E-class, but of­fers more re­fine­ment in ar­eas of ride qual­ity and cabin acous­tics. It also han­dles bet­ter, ex­ud­ing more con­fi­dence at higher speeds. It is, how­ever, far from per­fect.</p>
    <p>The test-car is a 530i, which is more pow­er­ful than the E200 re­viewed on the pre­vi­ous page and is priced a tad higher.</p>
    <p>There is no change to per­for­mance or en­gine out­put, but the new model now comes with a 48-volt starter-gen­er­a­tor which of­fers an ex­tra 8kW or 11hp briefly to help the car over­come in­er­tia.</p>
    <p>On pa­per, this helps re­duce fuel con­sump­tion from 6.2 to 5.6 litres/100km. The test-car, how­ever, av­er­ages 10.9 litres/100km.</p>
    <p>While the BMW does not have as elab­o­rate a suite of shiny new gad­gets as the E, the car is far from rudi­men­tary. The 530i has a 12.3-inch touch­screen in­fo­tain­ment sys­tem which still of­fers in-built nav­i­ga­tion – a tad re­dun­dant given that it now pairs wire­lessly with smart­phones.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem may not look as mod­ern as the Merc’s panoramic screen, which spans more than half the length of its fas­cia, but it is in­tu­itive and func­tional.</p>
    <p>The car has re­mote soft­ware up­grade, which al­lows BMW to im­prove the car’s func­tions over the air. But most con­ve­nient of all, it has a prox­im­ity key sys­tem found in newer-gen­er­a­tion BMWs. This un­locks the car as you ap­proach it and locks it when you walk away.</p>
    <p>There are more driv­ing aids, in­clud­ing Re­vers­ing As­sis­tant, which takes con­trol of the steer­ing while back­ing up for dis­tances of up to 50m. BMW is still the only one with this fea­ture.</p>
    <p>Cos­met­i­cally, the car now has slim­mer full-LED head­lights with L-shape day­time-run­ning lights and non-daz­zling high beam. They flank a more prom­i­nent grille.</p>
    <p>On its fend­ers, the M Sport vari­ant fea­tures air vents and new Air Per­for­mance Wheels, which are lighter and more aero­dy­namic. In the rear, you will see L-shaped tail­lamps and trape­zoidal tail-pipes.</p>
    <p>Like the facelifted E-class, the 530i re­tains its model de­sign DNA, but looks dif­fer­ent enough to at­tract glances.</p>
    <p>In­side, the 530i re­mains as en­gag­ing as be­fore. De­spite its size (it is big­ger than the E), it is ag­ile, re­spon­sive and ma­noeu­vrable.</p>
    <p>Putting aside its power su­pe­ri­or­ity over the E200, the 530i charms you with its ex­quis­ite chas­sis con­trol. Its sus­pen­sion is firm yet of­fers the right amount of yield when needed.</p>
    <p>While you can de­tect a bit more vi­bra­tion on its steer­ing wheel than the E200’s, and its gear changes at lower speeds may not be as con­sis­tently smooth as the E’s, this does not de­tract from the car’s over­all re­fine­ment.</p>
    <p>For pas­sen­gers, its ex­tra mil­lime­tres in width and wheel­base over the E trans­late to a slightly roomier cabin.</p>
    <p>On the whole, this makeover is less elab­o­rate than the E’s. But you wouldn’t want to change a win­ning recipe too much, would you?</p>
