    <p>TAIPEI • On Mon­day, Tai­wane­seAmer­i­can singer Wi l l Pan an­nounced on Instagram that he had tied the knot with 26-year-old Luna Xuan, whom he said he had been dat­ing for five years.</p>
    <p>In 2017, Pan, 39, took part in Chi­nese celebrity dat­ing show We Are In Love (2015 to 2017), which means he and Xuan were al­ready a cou­ple then.</p>
    <p>Alert ne­ti­zens were quick to flag the over­lap in the time­line.</p>
    <p>A spin-off of the pop­u­lar South Korean dat­ing show We Got Mar­ried (2008 to 2017), We Are In Love fol­lows sev­eral el­i­gi­ble celebrity bach­e­lors and bach­e­lorettes, who are paired and sent to dis­tant lo­ca­tions in the hope of spark­ing ro­mance.</p>
    <p>Pan was paired with Chi­nese host Wu Xin, 37, in the show’s third sea­son and had im­pressed view­ers with his at­ten­tive­ness and charisma. Fans hoped they would be­come an of­fi­cial cou­ple.</p>
    <p>The duo were known as the “koala cou­ple” in the show. Koala is “wu wei xiong” in Man­darin and the pair have the Chi­nese char­ac­ters “wu” and “wei” in their names. They even have a Weibo fan page ded­i­cated to them. The page has since been re­moved.</p>
    <p>How­ever, af­ter his mar­riage an­nounce­ment, fans are now con­demn­ing Pan for be­ing “dis­hon­est” and “ugly” by tak­ing part in the re­al­ity show while dat­ing Xuan, whom Ap­ple Daily Tai­wan re­ported is a Shang­hainese air stew­ardess.</p>
    <p>One ne­ti­zen crit­i­cised his lack of con­sid­er­a­tion to­wards Xuan and that his ap­pear­ance on the show was “cruel to ev­ery­one in­volved”. An­other said Xuan was “piti­ful”.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers felt an­gry for Wu. One ne­ti­zen said: “Us­ing other girls. Play­ing with their feel­ings and pre­tend­ing to be af­fec­tion­ate, ded­i­cated and in­no­cent. It turns out that the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try is re­ally dirty.”</p>
