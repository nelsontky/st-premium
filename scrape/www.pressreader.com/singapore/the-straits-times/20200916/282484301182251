    <p>•</p>
    <p>Wolver­hamp­ton Wan­der­ers man­ager Nuno Espir­ito Santo hailed his “fast and ag­gres­sive” side, who showed no weari­ness as they blew Sh­effield United away with goals in the first six min­utes to claim a 2-0 Pre­mier League win at Bra­mall Lane on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Wolves’ in­cred­i­ble 59-game sea­son, which took in 10 coun­tries on their Europa League ad­ven­ture, fin­ished only on Aug 11, and with just one new sign­ing in the side to face the Blades, Nuno was ask­ing a great deal of the same faces.</p>
    <p>But after a fine, flow­ing move,</p>
    <p>Wolves scored through Raul Jimenez in the third minute – their quick­est Pre­mier League goal since Fe­bru­ary 2011 – and just 205 sec­onds later, they added an­other goal through Ro­main Saiss as they started the sea­son in style.</p>
    <p>Jimenez, who played in 55 of last sea­son’s games, never stopped run­ning, with Nuno’s in­no­va­tive for­ma­tion bear­ing fruit.</p>
    <p>Dy­namic winger Adama Traore was de­ployed at wing-back, while the mid­field reg­u­larly changed shape to keep Sh­effield guess­ing.</p>
    <p>“We started fast and ag­gres­sive,” said Nuno, who has just signed a new three-year deal.</p>
    <p>“We went for the game in those mo­ments and it made all the dif­fer­ence. It was a quick turn­around (be­tween seasons) but the play­ers were amaz­ing the way they worked.</p>
    <p>“It is our (coach­ing staff’s) job to try to cre­ate so­lu­tions. It is the result of dif­fer­ent play­ers in dif­fer­ent po­si­tions. The idea is to give them free­dom on the pitch. We are just get­ting started.”</p>
    <p>Wolves cap­tain Conor Coady is pleased the man who steered Wolves from the Cham­pi­onship to the top seven in the Pre­mier League last term is stay­ing to see his project through.</p>
    <p>“It is mas­sive for us,” he said. “When you see how he works with us in and around the train­ing ground. He is a fan­tas­tic man­ager.”</p>
    <p>Top-seven fin­ishes in the last two seasons have set the bar very high, but break­ing into the top six, among the so-called Pre­mier League elite, rep­re­sents a tall or­der.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Wolves flour­ished last sea­son even with their Europa League campaign drag­ging them to all cor­ners of Europe.</p>
    <p>Now, with­out Euro­pean foot­ball to con­tend with, their small, closeknit squad will ben­e­fit from ex­tra rest time and can set their Pre­mier League sights even higher.</p>
    <p>Sh­effield boss Chris Wilder was not too dis­heart­ened with his side’s over­all per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>He said: “To re­cover from as poor a start as I can re­mem­ber here was al­ways go­ing to be a tough ask. But we gave it a right go. I felt we just missed some­thing.”</p>
