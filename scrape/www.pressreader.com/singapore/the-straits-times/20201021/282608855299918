    <p>JEFF BRIDGES HAS LYM­PHOMA: Amer­i­can film star Jeff Bridges an­nounced on Mon­day that he has been di­ag­nosed with lym­phoma, a form of can­cer that starts in the body’s in­fec­tion-fight­ing cells called lym­pho­cytes.</p>
    <p>Bridges, 70, who is best known for his role as a tipsy slacker in the Coen brothers’ cult clas­sic The Big Le­bowski (1998), did not give much de­tails about his con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>“As the Dude would say. New S**T has come to light. I have been di­ag­nosed with Lym­phoma. Although it is a se­ri­ous disease, I feel for­tu­nate that I have a great team of doc­tors and the prog­no­sis is good. I’m start­ing treat­ment and will keep you posted on my re­cov­ery,” he said on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Bridges has been nom­i­nated seven times for an Os­car, in­clud­ing for one of his early roles in the black-and-white movie The Last Pic­ture Show (1971), fi­nally win­ning for his per­for­mance as an age­ing coun­try singer in 2009’s Crazy Heart.</p>
    <p>He also starred in Thun­der­bolt And Light­foot (1974) next to ac­tor Clint East­wood and The Fab­u­lous Baker Boys (1989), in which he played a jazz mu­si­cian along­side his brother Beau.</p>
    <p>In a fol­low-up tweet, Bridges thanked well-wish­ers for their mes­sages of sup­port, adding: “And, while I have you, please re­mem­ber to go vote. Be­cause we are in this to­gether.”</p>
