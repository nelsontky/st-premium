    <p>CRUISES TO NOWHERE: From next month, two cruise lines will of­fer such cruises from Sin­ga­pore. They will have to fol­low a set of strin­gent safety guide­lines, but hor­ror sto­ries of those struck with Covid-19 while aboard cruise ships ear­lier this year were still fresh on the minds of Face­book users. Oth­ers are turned off by the idea of tak­ing a swab test a few days be­fore board­ing. ST Face­book user Nickie Woo com­mented: “I see so many peo­ple against the idea... Let’s see how fast the cruise tick­ets will be sold.”</p>
    <p>BOON LAY KNIFE AT­TACK: A man was left bleed­ing, with in­juries to his face, af­ter he was at­tacked by a teenager with a knife at a FairPrice su­per­mar­ket in Boon Lay Shop­ping Cen­tre last Wed­nes­day. An 18-year-old was charged on Fri­day over his alleged in­volve­ment: “Slash­ing in a su­per­mar­ket? Many peo­ple are get­ting more brazen these days,” com­mented ST Face­book user Robert Ridzuandow­ski.</p>
