    <p>TOP GLOVE CHIEF LIM WEE CHAI, WHOSE WORK­ERS ARE FAC­ING A COVID-19 OUT­BREAK. A11</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s Top Glove yes­ter­day de­fended its record on worker wel­fare, say­ing it has spent RM20 mil­lion (S$6.6 mil­lion) to im­prove ac­com­mo­da­tion for its fac­tory work­ers in the last two months, as a ma­jor Covid-19 out­break at its Se­lan­gor fac­to­ries and dor­mi­to­ries puts it un­der the spot­light.</p>
    <p>Top Glove ex­ec­u­tive chair­man and founder Lim Wee Chai de­nied al­le­ga­tions by Hu­man Re­sources Min­is­ter M. Sar­a­vanan that hous­ing fa­cil­i­ties for its work­ers are “ter­ri­ble”.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Lim told a vir­tual news con­fer­ence that the min­is­ter had vis­ited the dor­mi­to­ries sev­eral months ago and in­di­cated that they were fine, and that he does not know what is “dif­fer­ent” now.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim added that the hous­ing con­di­tions had “con­tin­ued to im­prove”, and wel­comed an­other visit by Datuk Seri Sar­a­vanan.</p>
    <p>Top Glove has around 21,000 em­ploy­ees glob­ally, with about 11,000 in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Some 5,900 of the Malaysi­abased work­ers live in the com­pany’s premises in Meru, in Se­lan­gor’s Klang district, as the plants op­er­ate round the clock.</p>
    <p>The world’s big­gest maker of rub­ber gloves runs 47 plants in</p>
    <p>Malaysia, Thai­land, China and Viet­nam, with 36 of them pro­duc­ing gloves.</p>
    <p>The com­pany also makes other per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment (PPE), in­clud­ing face masks.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment on Mon­day said Top Glove must shut 28 of its Malaysian fac­tory build­ings in stages to al­low for health checks, with more than 4,000 Covid-19 cases al­ready de­tected among work­ers and close con­tacts.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim, 62, whose wealth is es­ti­mated by Forbes at US$4.2 bil­lion (S$5.64 bil­lion) af­ter the com­pany’s value mul­ti­plied by at least six times this year, said his work­ers have been moved to bet­ter ac­com­mo­da­tion.</p>
    <p>The min­i­mum re­quire­ment of space and toi­lets for work­ers had been ad­hered to, he added.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s premises also have their own fa­cil­i­ties – in­clud­ing ATMs, bar­ber shops, mini-markets, can­teens and gym­na­si­ums – to re­duce the need for work­ers to go out.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim added that he en­cour­ages his work­ers to fol­low good health and hy­giene prac­tices – such as show­er­ing twice a day, drink­ing at least eight glasses of wa­ter, ex­er­cis­ing and sleep­ing well.</p>
    <p>“We ask them to eat well, eat more healthily, eat more vegeta­bles, main­tain a balanced diet and drink more wa­ter.</p>
    <p>“We also sub­sidise veg­e­tar­ian meals for them. We have been do­ing this for some time.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany said yes­ter­day that not all the Covid-19 cases came from its fac­to­ries.</p>
    <p>The Hu­man Re­sources Min­istry has said it will en­force min­i­mum hous­ing stan­dards for mi­grant work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries be­gin­ning to­day.</p>
    <p>The plant clo­sures – which are be­ing done in stages – will cause a two-week de­lay in de­liv­er­ies, Mr Lim said, but he added that Top Glove has other plants out­side the coun­try which have not been af­fected.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim said he hopes the fac­to­ries in Klang will be re­opened in two to three weeks.</p>
    <p>He also as­sured the public that there was no risk of Covid-19 con­tam­i­na­tion from the com­pany’s prod­ucts, as the pro­duc­tion line is fully au­to­mated and there is no di­rect con­tact be­tween work­ers and the gloves, which are also sani­tised be­fore be­ing packed.</p>
    <p>“There is no con­tam­i­na­tion… (gloves are placed into) hot ovens at 110 deg C, so the virus can­not sur­vive there,” said Mr Lim.</p>
    <p>“Our fac­tory em­ploy­ees wear PPE, so there is no di­rect con­tact with gloves.”</p>
    <p>Malaysia makes just un­der twothirds of the world’s med­i­cal rub­ber gloves, but the man­u­fac­tur­ers’ as­so­ci­a­tion as­sured the public that sup­ply would not be dis­rupted.</p>
    <p>“Be as­sured that new ca­pac­ity is avail­able to make good the in­terim short­fall and there is not go­ing to be any ag­gra­vated dis­rup­tion to what­ever is cur­rently be­ing sup­plied to the world,” the Malaysian Rub­ber Glove Man­u­fac­tur­ers As­so­ci­a­tion said yes­ter­day.</p>
