    <p>To the Tai­wanese, for­mer pres­i­dent Lee Teng-hui, who died on Thurs­day, played a huge and piv­otal role in the democrati­sa­tion of Tai­wan and the rise of the Tai­wanese iden­tity.</p>
    <p>But he was also a con­tro­ver­sial fig­ure who elicited either love or ha­tred in the is­land’s res­i­dents, de­pend­ing on their po­lit­i­cal stripes.</p>
    <p>Said the pro-uni­fi­ca­tion news­pa­per United Daily News in an ar­ti­cle yes­ter­day: “Lee Teng-hui is gone. Peo­ple have long for­got­ten what in those years trig­gered sen­si­tive nerves, but love and ha­tred still seethe over him.”</p>
    <p>Many from Kuom­intang (KMT), the party he led while he was pres­i­dent be­tween 1988 and 2000, feel he be­trayed it by giv­ing sup­port to the op­po­si­tion move­ment when the KMT was in power.</p>
    <p>In­deed, in later years, af­ter he left the KMT, he gave ex­plicit sup­port to the green camp, par­ties that favour Tai­wani­sa­tion – the em­pha­sis on Tai­wan cul­ture and his­tory – and Tai­wan in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>But that he is revered by the green camp goes be­yond what he did for them. “He was an im­por­tant turn­ing point (in Tai­wanese pol­i­tics), he was the spir­i­tual leader of the green camp, be­ing the first na­tive Tai­wanese to be pres­i­dent,” said Mr Yan Jiann-fa, for­mer head of China af­fairs at the Demo­cratic Pro­gres­sive Party (DPP), now the rul­ing party.</p>
    <p>But Tai­wanese in the blue camp, who favour uni­fi­ca­tion with China, feel ag­grieved that Mr Lee had pushed Tai­wan and China fur­ther apart through con­tentious cross-strait poli­cies.</p>
    <p>And while Tai­wanese agree that Mr Lee was “Mr Democ­racy”, they also be­lieve he al­lowed cor­rup­tion to creep into Tai­wanese pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>DEMO­CRATIC RE­FORMS</p>
    <p>When Mr Lee came to power in 1988 af­ter the death of then Pres­i­dent Chi­ang Ching-kuo, his po­si­tion was pre­car­i­ous as he was a na­tive Tai­wanese in a party led mainly by main­lan­ders. These Tai­wanese had come to the is­land with the KMT af­ter it lost the civil war on the main­land to the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP) in 1949.</p>
    <p>At the time of his death, Mr Chi­ang had be­gun po­lit­i­cal re­forms, in­clud­ing al­low­ing other po­lit­i­cal par­ties and in­duct­ing na­tive Tai­wanese into the KMT.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Tai­wan ex­pert Shel­ley Rig­ger, Mr Lee’s re­sponse to the con­ser­va­tives within the KMT, who were putting pres­sure on him, was “pure ge­nius”.</p>
    <p>He “har­nessed the pop­u­lar­ity of democrati­sa­tion to strengthen his own po­si­tion”, wrote Pro­fes­sor Rig­ger of David­son Col­lege in the United States, in her book Why Tai­wan Mat­ters – Small Is­land, Global Pow­er­house.</p>
    <p>“He be­came a lead­ing re­form ad­vo­cate; in the process, he in­creased sup­port for the KMT and marginalis­ed the con­ser­va­tives,” she wrote.</p>
    <p>His re­forms in­cluded re­tir­ing rep­re­sen­ta­tives of the Na­tional As­sem­bly and the Leg­isla­tive Yuan, or Par­lia­ment, who were elected in main­land China in the 1940s and whose seats could not be con­tested in Tai­wan. This re­form meant that both the Na­tional As­sem­bly, which had the power to elect the pres­i­dent and re­vise the Con­sti­tu­tion, and the Leg­isla­tive Yuan could now be fully elected.</p>
    <p>But it was the first di­rect elec­tion of the pres­i­dent in 1996 that was to have a far-reach­ing im­pact by bring­ing to the fore a con­scious­ness of be­ing Tai­wanese, in part be­cause of Bei­jing’s ve­he­ment op­po­si­tion to the move, which in­cluded fir­ing mis­siles into the Tai­wan Strait.</p>
    <p>Elec­toral re­forms, how­ever, al­lowed cor­rup­tion, such as vote-buy­ing, to creep in, which crit­ics said Mr Lee did lit­tle to curb.</p>
    <p>Said the first DPP Jus­tice Min­is­ter Chen Ding-nan in June 2000: “Lee Teng-hui is the source of Tai­wan’s black gold (cor­rup­tion) pol­i­tics. He knew where it was and did lit­tle more than talk about the need to com­bat it.”</p>
    <p>CROSS-STRAIT TIES</p>
    <p>In 1990, Mr Lee set up the Na­tional Uni­fi­ca­tion Coun­cil, uni­lat­er­ally de­clared an end to the civil war with the CCP the fol­low­ing year and be­gan ne­go­ti­a­tions with Bei­jing. This cul­mi­nated in talks in Sin­ga­pore in 1993, a high point in cross-strait ties.</p>
    <p>But the gap be­tween the two sides was wide. Bei­jing’s idea of one</p>
    <p>China was that of Tai­wan as a lo­cal gov­ern­ment, while to Mr Lee, the two sides were sep­a­rate and equal po­lit­i­cal en­ti­ties, with the Repub­lic of China, es­tab­lished in 1912, now in Tai­wan, and the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China on the main­land.</p>
    <p>To him, re­uni­fi­ca­tion could take place only “un­der a sys­tem of democ­racy, free­dom, and eq­ui­table pros­per­ity that will safe­guard the rights and in­ter­ests of all Chi­nese”.</p>
    <p>In other words, it would not hap­pen while the two sides’ po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic sys­tems were worlds apart.</p>
    <p>He also re­jected “one coun­try, two sys­tems” as mak­ing “a very un­equal dis­tinc­tion be­tween cen­tral and lo­cal”, he wrote in his book, The Road To Democ­racy: Tai­wan’s Pur­suit Of Iden­tity.</p>
    <p>In 1999, he went fur­ther to char­ac­terise re­la­tions be­tween the two sides as “spe­cial state-to-state re­la­tions” in an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>To some an­a­lysts, what Mr Lee did was to make ex­plicit Tai­wan’s po­si­tion that its gov­ern­ment was as sov­er­eign as Bei­jing’s.</p>
    <p>But this in­fu­ri­ated the Chi­nese, who saw it as proof of Mr Lee’s “split­tist” in­ten­tions, and sus­pended talks.</p>
    <p>Upon news of his death, the Tai­wan Af­fairs Of­fice said “Tai­wan in­de­pen­dence is a dead-end road” and that the “his­tor­i­cal trend of na­tional re­uni­fi­ca­tion and re­ju­ve­na­tion can­not be stopped by any­one or any force”.</p>
    <p>Still, po­lit­i­cal sci­ence pro­fes­sor Liao Dachi of the Na­tional Sun Yat-sen Univer­sity said Mr Lee was a leader who was able to achieve what he set out to do and that his lead­er­ship style was worth study­ing.</p>
    <p>“He is a per­son­age who is ad­mired and dreaded by the Chi­nese main­land.”</p>
    <p>SEM­I­NAL FIG­URE</p>
    <p>He was an im­por­tant turn­ing point (in Tai­wanese pol­i­tics), he was the spir­i­tual leader of the green camp, be­ing the first na­tive Tai­wanese ’’ to be pres­i­dent.</p>
