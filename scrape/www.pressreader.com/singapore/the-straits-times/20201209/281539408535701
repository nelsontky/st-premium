    <p>In­dia has bought 1.6 bil­lion doses of the Covid-19 vac­cine, which is more than any other coun­try, ac­cord­ing to a global anal­y­sis. Us­ing its mas­sive man­u­fac­tur­ing clout, it bought more doses than high-in­come coun­tries, such as the United States and Bri­tain, and more than the Euro­pean Union as a whole.</p>
    <p>In­dia has bought 1.6 bil­lion doses of Covid-19 vac­cines, which is more than any other coun­try, ac­cord­ing to a global anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>Us­ing its mas­sive man­u­fac­tur­ing clout, the coun­try pur­chased 500 mil­lion doses of the Ox­ford Univer­sity-As­traZeneca vac­cine can­di­date, one bil­lion doses from Amer­i­can firm No­vavax and 100 mil­lion doses of the Sput­nik V can­di­date from Rus­sia’s Ga­ma­leya Re­search In­sti­tute, said the US-based Duke Univer­sity Global Health In­no­va­tion Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>In­dia, a mid­dle-in­come coun­try, bought more doses than high-in­come coun­tries, such as the US and Bri­tain, and more than the Euro­pean Union as a whole, all of which have in-coun­try vac­cine devel­op­ment ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>The EU has pre-booked 1.58 bil­lion doses and the United States bought 1.01 bil­lion doses.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore any vac­cine can­di­dates were ap­proved by reg­u­la­tors, there were con­firmed pur­chases of 7.3 bil­lion doses, with an­other 2.5 bil­lion doses un­der ne­go­ti­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“Many of these coun­tries will be able to vac­ci­nate their en­tire pop­u­la­tion – and some will be able to do so many times over – be­fore bil­lions of peo­ple are vac­ci­nated in low-in­come coun­tries,” said the Duke re­port.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s 1.6 bil­lion doses would cover 800 mil­lion peo­ple, or 60 per cent of its pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Last month, In­dian Health Min­is­ter Harsh Vard­han said an es­ti­mated 400 mil­lion to 500 mil­lion doses were to be made avail­able to 250 mil­lion to 300 mil­lion peo­ple across the coun­try by July-Au­gust next year.</p>
    <p>The Duke re­port said that rich coun­tries ne­go­ti­ated pur­chases by in­vest­ing pub­lic funds into vac­cine re­search and devel­op­ment and by us­ing their pur­chas­ing power to strike early deals. The coun­tries hedged their bets by pur­chas­ing mul­ti­ple vac­cine can­di­dates, in case some do not ma­te­ri­alise.</p>
    <p>As a mid­dle-in­come coun­try, In­dia has been able to move to the front of the queue by us­ing an­other strat­egy: lever­ag­ing its large man­u­fac­tur­ing in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>“Coun­tries with man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­ity, such as In­dia and Brazil, have been suc­cess­ful in ne­go­ti­at­ing large ad­vance mar­ket com­mit­ments with lead­ing vac­cine can­di­dates as part of the man­u­fac­tur­ing agree­ments,” said the Duke re­port, which was com­piled after gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials across the world – in­clud­ing in In­dia – were con­sulted to ex­plain their high pro­cure­ment strat­egy.</p>
    <p>In­dia is the largest man­u­fac­turer of vac­cines in the world, mak­ing 60 per cent of the global sup­ply.</p>
    <p>It is also home to the Pune-based Serum In­sti­tute of In­dia (SII), the world’s big­gest vac­cine pro­ducer.</p>
    <p>Of the three vac­cine can­di­dates the South Asian coun­try has booked, SII is man­u­fac­tur­ing two within In­dia – the Ox­ford-As­traZeneca vac­cine and the No­vavax can­di­date.</p>
    <p>Of the 3.73 bil­lion doses of the Ox­ford and No­vavax vac­cines pur­chased by all coun­tries, about three bil­lion will be made by SII.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia’s Sput­nik V vac­cine is also be­ing man­u­fac­tured by Dr Reddy’s Lab in Hy­der­abad.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s two do­mes­tic vac­cine can­di­dates have also re­ceived ap­proval to en­ter Phase 3 of their clin­i­cal tri­als.</p>
    <p>Hy­der­abad-based Bharat Biotech and Gu­jarat-based Zy­dusCadila “could also add about 400 mil­lion doses an­nu­ally”, vi­rol­o­gist Shahid Jameel, direc­tor of the Trivedi School of Bio­sciences at Ashoka Univer­sity, told the Press Trust of In­dia.</p>
    <p>Pfizer over the week­end sought emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion in In­dia, fol­lowed by As­tra Zeneca’s Co­vishield vac­cine, which is be­ing man­u­fac­tured in In­dia by the SII.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral Health Sec­re­tary Ra­jesh Bhushan told a press brief­ing yes­ter­day that In­dia’s Bharat Biotech has also sought emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion for its vac­cine, Co­vaxin. He added that some vac­cine can­di­dates may get li­censed in the next few weeks.</p>
