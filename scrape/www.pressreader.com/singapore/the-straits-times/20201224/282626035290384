    <p>BANGKOK • Thai fe­male band Lyra, backed by the world’s big­gest mu­sic la­bel Uni­ver­sal Mu­sic Group (UMG), are hop­ing to har­ness their de­voted fan base and match the suc­cess of South Korean artists who have turned K-pop into an in­ter­na­tional phe­nom­e­non.</p>
    <p>“We have high ex­pec­ta­tions. We want to in­tro­duce... T-pop mu­sic to the world,” said 20-year-old Lyra mem­ber Jen­nis Oprasert.</p>
    <p>Last year, UMG part­nered Thai firm In­de­pen­dent Artist Man­age­ment (iAM) to launch the sixmem­ber group, af­ter au­di­tion­ing about 80 girls and young women from the pop­u­lar idol group BNK48.</p>
    <p>“It’s a bet,” said Mr Paul Sirisant, who heads UMG in Thailand.</p>
    <p>But he be­lieves orig­i­nal­ity will drive the band’s suc­cess.</p>
    <p>The group trained for months re­motely via Zoom and later lived to­gether in a house af­ter plans to go to Los An­ge­les were in­ter­rupted by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We saw them trans­form into their in­di­vid­ual artis­tic selves, which is great, but there were many tears,” Mr Sirisant said.</p>
    <p>Nav­i­gat­ing the shift from BNK48’s mu­si­cal style was not al­ways straight­for­ward.</p>
    <p>“It’s not an easy ride at all,” said 18-year-old Nat­ticha “Fond” Chan­tar­ava­reelekha.</p>
    <p>“The danc­ing, the mu­sic genre is dif­fer­ent. I’ve never done it be­fore, but even though it’s hard, I’ve loved (do­ing) it since I was a kid, so I’m ready.”</p>
    <p>Their epony­mous de­but sin­gle has more than 6.5 mil­lion views on YouTube af­ter about two months.</p>
    <p>“We in­cor­po­rated Thai el­e­ments by in­clud­ing sounds from two tra­di­tional in­stru­ments,” said an­other mem­ber, Pun­sikorn “Pun” Tiyakorn, 20, who also came up with the group’s name.</p>
    <p>Fans at home and abroad have been sup­port­ive.</p>
    <p>“I will sup­port them un­til the end,” said 23-year-old Danaiphat Singto as he watched a video of a per­for­mance by the band in</p>
    <p>Bangkok.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally want them to reach global au­di­ences.”</p>
    <p>The band are part of a wave of Thai mu­si­cians gain­ing at­ten­tion from au­di­ences and in­vestors abroad.</p>
    <p>Thai-Ger­man singer Jan­nine Weigel was the first artist to sign with RedRecords, a ven­ture between UMG and low-cost car­rier Ai­rA­sia.</p>
    <p>Early signs of suc­cess al­ready have la­bels plan­ning new groups.</p>
    <p>“We plan to have more bands with Uni­ver­sal,” said Mr Nat­aphol Pavar­avad­hana, chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer at iAM. “It will be dif­fer­ent from Lyra for sure, maybe in­die. Stay tuned.”</p>
