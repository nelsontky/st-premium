    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • The gov­ern­ment has launched a Buy Malaysian Prod­ucts cam­paign and will ded­i­cate some ar­eas to sell only lo­cal prod­ucts to help sellers re­bound from post-lock­down blues.</p>
    <p>Launch­ing the cam­paign in Kuala Lumpur last Satur­day, Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin said: “I call upon all con­sumers to spend for Malaysia.” He added that the money spent would en­sure that the econ­omy re­mained com­pet­i­tive as it would cre­ate job op­por­tu­ni­ties and gen­er­ate rev­enue for peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“I hope this cam­paign will serve as a start­ing point for the gov­ern­ment, in­dus­try and the peo­ple to forge col­lab­o­ra­tion to help re­vive the econ­omy post Covid-19 pan­demic, and spur growth,” he said.</p>
    <p>The World Bank said in June that it ex­pected Malaysia’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct to shrink by 3.1 per cent this year, against a 4.3 per cent ex­pan­sion last year.</p>
    <p>Malaysia im­posed a move­ment con­trol or­der (MCO) that locked down much of the coun­try from March 18, and only grad­u­ally eased the rules on May 4, in its bid to stem the spread of the coro­n­avirus. The coun­try has now en­tered what it calls re­cov­ery MCO, with most sec­tors of the econ­omy, in­clud­ing cin­e­mas and malls, re­opened.</p>
    <p>New cases of the coro­n­avirus have been well be­low 20 a day for sev­eral weeks in the coun­try of 32 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Malaysia re­ported nine new cases last Satur­day to bring the cu­mu­la­tive to­tal to 8,764 with to­tal deaths re­main­ing steady at 122.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Muhyid­din said the gov­ern­ment has re­viewed its poli­cies to re­duce de­pen­dence on im­ports. “Malaysia must have the ca­pa­bil­ity to pro­duce crit­i­cal prod­ucts such as food and bev­er­age, med­i­cal de­vices, medicines, petro­chem­i­cal as well as per­sonal pro­tec­tion gear such as masks and gloves.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Fed­eral Ter­ri­to­ries Min­is­ter An­nuar Musa said shop­ping streets will be cre­ated at se­lected lo­ca­tions to pro­mote the Buy Malaysian Prod­ucts cam­paign.</p>
    <p>A pop­u­lar Kuala Lumpur shop­ping street – Jalan Tunku Ab­dul Rah­man – would be the first to be trans­formed into a venue for traders to sell lo­cal goods ahead of the Hari Raya Haji cel­e­bra­tion on July 31, he said.</p>
    <p>“After fight­ing against Covid-19, it is time to fight for the na­tion’s eco­nomic sur­vival,” he said.</p>
