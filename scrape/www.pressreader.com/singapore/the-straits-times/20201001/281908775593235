    <p>•</p>
    <p>Kuwait’s new emir was sworn in yes­ter­day in Par­lia­ment as the coun­try pre­pared to lay to rest late ruler Sheikh Sabah al-Ah­mad al-Sabah, who helped steer the US-al­lied Gulf state through some of the Mid­dle East’s most tur­bu­lent decades.</p>
    <p>The Cabi­net swiftly named the des­ig­nated suc­ces­sor, Crown Prince Sheikh Nawaf al-Ah­mad alSabah, as ruler on Tues­day fol­low­ing the death of Sheikh Sabah, 91, whose body ar­rived in Kuwait yes­ter­day from the United States, where he had been hos­pi­talised since July.</p>
    <p>Sheikh Nawaf, 83, pledged to work for the Opec (Or­gan­i­sa­tion of Petroleum Ex­port­ing Coun­tries) mem­ber coun­try’s pros­per­ity, sta­bil­ity and se­cu­rity af­ter tak­ing the oath of of­fice, rais­ing both hands to his head as law­mak­ers ap­plauded.</p>
    <p>“Our dear na­tion to­day faces dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tions and dan­ger­ous chal­lenges that can only be over­come... by uni­fy­ing ranks and work­ing hard to­gether,” he told the Na­tional Assem­bly.</p>
    <p>The fu­neral has been re­stricted to mem­bers of the rul­ing fam­ily, ow­ing to con­cerns about the coro­n­avirus which – along with low oil prices – has strained the wealthy petroleum pro­ducer’s fi­nances. The coun­try has be­gun a 40-day pe­riod of na­tional mourning.</p>
    <p>“We hon­estly feel like we’re go­ing to be lost with­out his guid­ance,” said Ms Fa­jer, a Kuwaiti woman.</p>
    <p>Dig­ni­taries from around the world paid re­spects to the sea­soned diplo­mat and savvy politi­cian, who was widely re­spected as a hu­man­i­tar­ian who strove to heal rifts in the Mid­dle East, mend­ing ties with for­mer oc­cu­pier Iraq and try­ing un­til his death to re­solve a bit­ter Gulf dis­pute.</p>
    <p>In her con­do­lence let­ter to Sheikh Nawaf yes­ter­day, Pres­i­dent</p>
    <p>Hal­imah Ya­cob said Sin­ga­pore will al­ways ap­pre­ci­ate the long­stand­ing sup­port of Sheikh Sabah with re­gard to the bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“His High­ness re­mained a strong be­liever of co­op­er­a­tion among small states such as Kuwait and Sin­ga­pore for mu­tual ben­e­fit,” said the Pres­i­dent, adding that she re­called his “en­dur­ing op­ti­mism” for pre­serv­ing re­gional sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts saw Sheikh Sabah’s death – fol­low­ing that ear­lier this year of Oman’s Sul­tan Qa­boos, who also played a mod­er­at­ing and bal­anc­ing role in the re­gion – as the end of an era in the Gulf.</p>
    <p>An ag­gres­sive younger gen­er­a­tion has risen to power, par­tic­u­larly in Saudi Ara­bia and the United Arab Emi­rates, which have taken hawk­ish stands against ri­val Iran.</p>
    <p>“Though the in­com­ing power bro­kers in neigh­bour­ing Gulf coun­tries did not al­ways heed his advice, the Emir was a reminder of an or­der hard-fought to achieve that was the ba­sis for the good­will in­ter­na­tional part­ners bear the re­gion,” wrote Ms Kirsten Fon­tenrose, direc­tor of the At­lantic Coun­cil’s Scowcroft Mid­dle East Se­cu­rity Ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>Sheikh Nawaf, who has held high of­fice for decades, takes over as Kuwait is fac­ing the reper­cus­sions of the coro­n­avirus cri­sis, which has trig­gered a sharp de­cline in oil prices and se­vere eco­nomic con­se­quences for Gulf states.</p>
    <p>The el­der states­man, who was named heir ap­par­ent i n 2006, served as de­fence min­is­ter when Iraqi troops rolled into the oil-rich emi­rate in 1990, and also as in­te­rior min­is­ter in the face of chal­lenges from Is­lamist mil­i­tants.</p>
    <p>The new leader is pop­u­lar within the rul­ing al-Sabah fam­ily and is re­ported to have been a con­sen­sus choice for ruler.</p>
    <p>He also en­joys a rep­u­ta­tion for mod­esty and has l argely main­tained a low pro­file.</p>
    <p>Kuwait’s oil, in­vest­ment and for­eign poli­cies are not ex­pected to change un­der his rule.</p>
    <p>De­spite ex­pec­ta­tions for a smooth suc­ces­sion, there could be more spir­ited de­bate over who the new crown prince should be. Kuwait’s Con­sti­tu­tion stip­u­lates that the ruler should be a de­scen­dant of the na­tion’s founder Mubarak al-Sabah, but the throne has al­ter­nated be­tween the de­scen­dants of his sons, Salem and Jaber, for four decades.</p>
    <p>Con­tes­tants for the newly va­cated role of crown prince in­clude Sheikh Sabah’s son and for­mer deputy prime min­is­ter Nasser Sabah al-Ah­mad al-Sabah, a Kuwaiti po­lit­i­cal heavy­weight.</p>
