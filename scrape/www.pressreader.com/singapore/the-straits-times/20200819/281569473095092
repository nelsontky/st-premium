    <p>Dal­las Mav­er­icks star Luka Don­cic (right) scored 42 points against the Los An­ge­les Clip­pers on Mon­day – the most any player has scored on his Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion play-off de­but. But the Mav­er­icks still fell 110-118 in Game 1 of the Western Con­fer­ence first-round se­ries thanks to Kawhi Leonard’s own his­toric per­for­mance for the Clip­pers.</p>
    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • It was al­most a maiden Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion play-off game to savour for Luka Don­cic.</p>
    <p>The reign­ing Rookie of the Year had 42 points against league con­tenders Los An­ge­les Clip­pers on Mon­day – the most any player has scored on his post-sea­son de­but.</p>
    <p>The Clip­pers were blown away, with for­ward Paul Ge­orge call­ing him “the fu­ture”, while coach Doc Rivers said he saw “great­ness” at Dis­ney World.</p>
    <p>Ex­cept Don­cic did not quite see it that way, la­belling his per­for­mance “ter­ri­ble”.</p>
    <p>Ever the per­fec­tion­ist, the Slove­nian guard was un­happy with his 11 turnovers, al­though had Dal­las, who were mak­ing their first play­off ap­pear­ance since 2016, not lost 118-110 in Game 1, his mood would cer­tainly have been better.</p>
    <p>Their de­feat could not be pinned on Don­cic, but rather a com­bi­na­tion of bril­liance by Fi­nals Most Valu­able Player Kawhi Leonard and a soft ejec­tion early in the third quar­ter for Kristaps Porzingis that swung things in favour of the Clip­pers.</p>
    <p>For­ward Leonard, who is chas­ing his third cham­pi­onship after win­ning with the San An­to­nio Spurs in 2014 and lead­ing the Toronto Rap­tors to their first ti­tle last year, paced his team in the three most im­por­tant cat­e­gories at Dis­ney World.</p>
    <p>He led them with 29 points, pulled down 12 boards and had six as­sists, mak­ing him the first player in league his­tory to lead three dif­fer­ent fran­chises in those cat­e­gories in a post-sea­son game.</p>
    <p>Team­mate Ge­orge was also not far be­hind, tal­ly­ing 27 points, and he ad­mit­ted he was rel­ish­ing the task of lead­ing the Clip­pers to not only their first Western Con­fer­ence</p>
    <p>Fi­nals, but the cham­pi­onship as well.</p>
    <p>“This is my 10th year in the league and I still get but­ter­flies,” said the for­ward.</p>
    <p>“It took the sec­ond half for me to get go­ing but I un­der­stood just to let the game flow.”</p>
    <p>The game, how­ever, was af­fected by a con­tro­ver­sial call to toss out Porzingis after the Lat­vian cen­tre tried to in­ter­vene in a skir­mish be­tween Don­cic and Clip­pers for­ward Mar­cus Mor­ris.</p>
    <p>The All-Star, who had 14 points and six re­bounds, seemed to give Mor­ris a light push in the chest, but that did not ap­pear to war­rant his sec­ond tech­ni­cal of the con­test.</p>
    <p>Mav­er­icks fans were out­raged on so­cial me­dia and even Los An­ge­les Lak­ers star LeBron James tweeted the ejec­tion was “bo­gus as hell”.</p>
    <p>The Clip­pers also had sym­pa­thy for Porzingis, with Rivers say­ing he “hated that”, while Mor­ris claimed he wished his op­po­nent had stayed on the court.</p>
    <p>Had he been present for most of the sec­ond half, things could have been very dif­fer­ent for the Mav­er­icks, with Don­cic in in­spired form.</p>
    <p>On the All-Star, Leonard said: “He’s great, you know what I mean? He’s very poised. He’s very trusted on that team. He can get to his spots, find his team­mates, gets them easy bas­kets. He makes tough bas­kets well. He’s a great player.”</p>
    <p>After­wards, Don­cic ex­pressed his frus­tra­tion with the Porzingis call, claim­ing “KP had my back” be­fore vow­ing to play better in Game 2 to­day.</p>
    <p>“That is 11 more pos­ses­sions, imag­ine that... I got to do way better than that,” he said. “I just want to win.”</p>
    <p>In the other se­ries open­ers, Ja­mal Mur­ray scored 36 points as the Den­ver Nuggets over­came a 57-point dis­play by Dono­van Mitchell to de­feat the Utah Jazz 135-125, while the Rap­tors beat the Brook­lyn Nets 134-110.</p>
