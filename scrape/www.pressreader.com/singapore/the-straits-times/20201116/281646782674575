    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Bil­lion­aire Elon Musk said in a tweet on Satur­day that he “most likely” has a mod­er­ate case of Covid-19, though he con­tin­ued to cast doubt on the ac­cu­racy of the tests, cit­ing the “wildly dif­fer­ent re­sults from dif­fer­ent labs”.</p>
    <p>Mr Musk, the chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Tesla and Space Ex­plo­ration Tech­nolo­gies (SpaceX), said his symp­toms are “that of a mi­nor cold”.</p>
    <p>He first dis­closed on Twit­ter on Friday that he had re­ceived in­con­clu­sive re­sults us­ing Bec­ton, Dick­in­son and Co’s rapid anti­gen test, get­ting two neg­a­tive and two pos­i­tive re­sults.</p>
    <p>Rapid tests have be­come more widely used in the fight against Covid-19, but these are known to be less ac­cu­rate than the more com­mon poly­merase chain re­ac­tion, or PCR, tests.</p>
    <p>Mr Musk, 49, has sown doubts about Covid-19, ques­tion­ing the vi­ral­ity of the dis­ease and claim­ing fa­tal­ity rates are over­stated. In his Satur­day tweet, he said “coro­n­avirus is a type of cold”, seem­ingly down­play­ing its risks.</p>
    <p>“A lit­tle up and down. Feels just like a reg­u­lar cold, but more body achy and cloudy head than cough­ing/sneez­ing,” the Tesla CEO wrote in re­ply to a user ask­ing about symp­toms.</p>
    <p>His pres­ence at the week­end launch of four Nasa as­tro­nauts into or­bit aboard his SpaceX com­pany’s space­craft had been thrown into ques­tion due to Covid-19.</p>
