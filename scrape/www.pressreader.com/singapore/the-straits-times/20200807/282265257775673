    <p>Bun­desliga run­ners-up Borus­sia Dort­mund may have halted plans to visit Asia this year be­cause of the Covid-19 pandemic but the club are still keen to reach out to their fans in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>The side an­nounced yes­ter­day that they will launch a vir­tual tour from Aug 19 to 24, with stops in Sin­ga­pore, Shang­hai and Tokyo.</p>
    <p>The Ger­mans were sched­uled to fea­ture in July’s In­ter­na­tional Cham­pi­ons Cup Sin­ga­pore and a pre-sea­son tour in Asia but both were cancelled ow­ing to the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>In a video con­fer­ence call with the global me­dia, Dort­mund’s head of the in­ter­na­tional depart­ment Benedikt Scholz said: “It is a chal­leng­ing time for all of us but we want to make the most of it.</p>
    <p>“Ac­ces­si­bil­ity and per­sonal con­tact are not pos­si­ble these days, so we want to have per­sonal con­tact via dig­i­tal and vir­tual means.</p>
    <p>“Our am­bi­tion is to be as close as pos­si­ble even with a dis­tance of 10,000km be­tween us, to give fans the feel­ing that we’re com­mit­ted to sup­port­ing you with your needs.”</p>
    <p>Tour ac­tiv­i­ties planned in­clude vir­tual meet-and-greet ses­sions, mer­chan­dise give­aways and live stream­ings of Dort­mund train­ing ses­sions and matches against Ger­man club MSV Duis­burg and Dutch side Feyeno­ord.</p>
    <p>The pre-sea­son mini tour­na­ment will take place on Aug 22 and both Dort­mund matches, along with post-match in­ter­views, will be streamed live. The club has also col­lab­o­rated with Sin­ga­pore Premier League club Lion City Sailors, whose foot­ballers will par­tic­i­pate in three chal­lenges per­form­ing tricks like the cross­bar chal­lenge. These videos will also be re­leased dur­ing the tour.</p>
    <p>BVB Asia-Pa­cific man­ag­ing direc­tor Suresh Letch­manan said: “What’s i mpor­tant is to bridge clubs in Sin­ga­pore and Ger­many. It’s a light-hearted way to show how we can con­nect since we’re apart.”</p>
    <p>Scholz added that the club plans to build on in­creased global in­ter­est af­ter the Bun­desliga was the first ma­jor Euro­pean league to restart on May 16. The six matches that day at­tracted over six mil­lion view­ers in Ger­many, a record for broad­cast­ers</p>

    <p>One of those games was the Ruhr Val­ley derby be­tween Dort­mund and Schalke, which the for­mer won 4-0. In the United King­dom, 1.4 mil­lion peo­ple watched this game across tele­vi­sion and dig­i­tal plat­forms, re­ported Forbes.</p>
    <p>Scholz said: “We re­alised there was tremen­dous in­ter­est as our rat­ings in­creased, which was nice for us. Now our am­bi­tion is to fol­low up with in­ter­ested peo­ple and reach out to them to grow the fan base of the club.” to web­site</p>
