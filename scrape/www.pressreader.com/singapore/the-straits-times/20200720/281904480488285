    <p>It is of con­cern that in­te­grated re­sort op­er­a­tor Re­sorts World Sen­tosa (RWS) is lay­ing off a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of em­ploy­ees as it grap­ples with the dev­as­ta­tion caused by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic in the tourism in­dus­try. It is un­der­stood that about 2,000 em­ploy­ees were laid off among the roughly 7,000 the firm had as of the end of last year. One sil­ver lin­ing is the an­nounce­ment by RWS that the re­trench­ment ex­er­cise was a “one­off work­place ra­tio­nal­i­sa­tion” and that the com­pany has man­aged to re­tain the vast ma­jor­ity of its lo­cal staff. How­ever, there are wor­ries that the RWS re­trench­ments could be just the be­gin­ning for heavy job losses in cer­tain sec­tors. An­a­lysts sug­gest that it could be a mat­ter of time be­fore Ma­rina Bay Sands will have to let go of some of its staff ow­ing to the fall­out from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Job losses, ter­ri­ble though they are for those af­fected, have be­come an in­evitabil­ity be­cause global tourism has been hard hit by the need for coun­tries to im­pose travel re­stric­tions. That is true of Sin­ga­pore as well. The in­te­grated re­sorts are geared to meet­ing ex­ter­nal de­mand. Do­mes­tic de­mand, while im­por­tant, is sim­ply too small to sus­tain their pre­vi­ous lev­els of eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity. Since ex­ter­nal de­mand has been shut off es­sen­tially, they can­not pre­serve their ex­ist­ing lev­els of man­power. The “ra­tio­nal­i­sa­tion” of the work­force is a cruel but ac­cu­rate de­scrip­tion of their ef­forts to pro­tect busi­ness in the long term.</p>
    <p>Work­ers will have to be let go in spite of ef­forts made by the in­dus­try and the Gov­ern­ment to sup­port busi­nesses in these dif­fi­cult times. It is nec­es­sary for com­pa­nies to be de­cent and fair to af­fected work­ers in terms of sev­er­ance ben­e­fits. Even re­trench­ments, painful as they are, can leave a mark on a com­pany’s rep­u­ta­tion in terms of how they are han­dled. Firms that em­pathise with their work­ers in bad times gain from rep­u­ta­tional trust that re­wards them with the abil­ity to at­tract and re­tain work­ers in bet­ter times when labour is scarce again. The tourism sec­tor is no dif­fer­ent in this re­gard from other sec­tors that will have to un­dergo re­struc­tur­ing in the months and years ahead. What large firms do sets a bench­mark of sorts for smaller in­dus­try play­ers as well.</p>
    <p>It is re­as­sur­ing that RWS has promised fair com­pen­sa­tion for laid-off staff. Also, lo­cal work­ers who were re­trenched will each have at least two to three job op­por­tu­ni­ties to con­sider as RWS works with the Gov­ern­ment and var­i­ous agen­cies to help them find new jobs. This dis­play of cor­po­rate ini­tia­tive is nec­es­sary be­cause the shock of los­ing jobs can leave some work­ers dis­ori­ented, de­spon­dent and in­ca­pable of tap­ping into of­fi­cial pro­grammes de­signed to help them. Also, whether in tourism or in other sec­tors, en­ter­prises should re­think how they op­er­ate and re­or­gan­ise their work sit­u­a­tions, train­ing staff to pre­pare for an upturn, which will come surely.</p>
