    <p>SYD­NEY Syd­ney’s Gay and Les­bian Mardi Gras will go ahead next year as a seated event in­stead of its usual glit­tery street pa­rade, to pro­tect rev­ellers against the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, or­gan­is­ers an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The pa­rade, which usu­ally draws tens of thou­sands of par­ty­go­ers, will move from its tra­di­tional route through the city’s gay hub to the Syd­ney Cricket Ground (SCG).</p>
    <p>“The 2021 pa­rade may look dif­fer­ent to how it has been in the past, but we feel very lucky to be able to give this op­por­tu­nity to our com­mu­ni­ties dur­ing these times,” Mardi Gras chief ex­ec­u­tive Al­bert Kruger said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The event, slated for March 6, will move away from large floats to bet­ter suit the venue and al­low a seated au­di­ence of up to 23,000, Mr Kruger said.</p>
    <p>“Not only is the SCG close to our spir­i­tual home of Ox­ford Street, but it also pro­vides the safest venue for us to hold the event,” he added.</p>
    <p>The first march in 1978 ended when po­lice vi­o­lently cracked down on a small group of protesters, but it has since grown to be one of the city’s big­gest events.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has largely sup­pressed Covid-19, al­low­ing the roll­back of so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions around the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The na­tion has recorded about 27,600 cases and 907 virus deaths in a pop­u­la­tion of 25 mil­lion.</p>
