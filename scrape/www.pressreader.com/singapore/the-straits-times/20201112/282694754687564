    <p>Ob­jec­tifs, the cen­tre for photograph­y and film in Mid­dle Road, has launched an on­line fund-raiser to sus­tain its op­er­a­tions as it reels from the im­pact of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple who do­nate $90 or more will be given a print of a work by one of 20 pho­tog­ra­phers, film-mak­ers and other artists – among whom are no­table names like Dar­ren Soh, Robert Zhao Ren­hui, Lenne Chai, John Clang, Kirsten Tan, Boo Jun­feng and Shu­bigi Rao.</p>
    <p>Out­reach di­rec­tor Ryan Chua says Ob­jec­tifs’ in­come has fallen by more than 70 per cent as a re­sult of the global pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We have been heart­ened by the gen­eros­ity of artists who have do­nated their work to sup­port our fund-raiser, the di­ver­sity of which re­flects the broad­ness and depth of our work with artists of all ages and back­grounds,” he adds.</p>
    <p>Q Fram­ing is spon­sor­ing the print­ing of the gifts.</p>
    <p>Ob­jec­tifs, a reg­is­tered char­ity, gets its in­come from grants, ed­u­ca­tional pro­grammes and com­mis­sioned projects. It hopes to raise at least $50,000 from this fund-raiser, which will go to­wards its op­er­a­tions, pro­grammes, and the artists and arts free­lancers it works with.</p>
    <p>It has moved many ac­tiv­i­ties on­line amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In April, it raised about $60,000 for the mi­grant worker com­mu­nity through an on­line print sale. All pro­ceeds went to the Hu­man­i­tar­ian Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Mi­gra­tion Eco­nom­ics (Home) and the Covid Mi­grant Sup­port Coali­tion.</p>
    <p>It also re­cently con­cluded the Ob­jec­tifs Short Film In­cu­ba­tor, a month-long dig­i­tal men­tor­ship pro­gramme for South-east Asian film­mak­ers, and launched the Ob­jec­tifs Film Li­brary, an on­line plat­form for award-win­ning short films.</p>
    <p>Mr Chua says: “The on­set of Covid-19 has been an op­por­tu­nity for us to adopt new ways of work­ing with the arts com­mu­nity and reach­ing out to the public. How­ever, many of th­ese dig­i­tal en­deav­ours are dif­fi­cult to mon­e­tise and the out­look is still un­cer­tain.</p>
    <p>“The public’s sup­port will en­able us to con­tinue the work we do for and with the com­mu­nity, cham­pi­oning film and photograph­y in Sin­ga­pore and South-east Asia.”</p>
    <p>The fund-raiser runs till Dec 31. Go to www.ob­jec­tifs.com.sg/ sup­port-ob­jec­tifs2020. Prints of vary­ing sizes are of­fered as gifts for do­na­tions of $90 and above, $300 and above, and $500 and above.</p>
