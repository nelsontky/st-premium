    <p>Step aside Net­flix. There’s a new player in Malaysia and it’s ready to pro­vide “re­spon­si­ble stream­ing” guided by Is­lamic val­ues.</p>
    <p>Called Nur­flix, the Is­lamic en­ter­tain­ment stream­ing ser­vice is sched­uled to start its trial phase next month, with an ini­tial 10,000 sub­scribers af­ter its July launch.</p>
    <p>With a RM40 mil­lion (S$13.2 mil­lion) bud­get, Nur­flix – nur means light in Ara­bic – is start­ing with its own orig­i­nal 12 dra­mas and films fea­tur­ing pop­u­lar lo­cal ac­tors.</p>
    <p>“We are not go­ing to tell you why you should be­have in a proper man­ner but through our con­tent, you will al­ready un­der­stand. Changes should come from within one­self,” it says on its web­site.</p>
    <p>The new stream­ing ser­vice is the brain­child of Nur­flix’s chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Syah Rizal Mo­hamed, a for­mer mem­ber of nasyid (Is­lamic bal­lads) group Broth­ers.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s chair­man is Datuk Seri Syed Zainal Abidin Syed Mo­hamed Tahir, a for­mer se­nior ex­ec­u­tive of na­tional pe­tro­leum firm Petronas, who also held key po­si­tions in Malaysian car­mak­ers Pero­dua and Pro­ton.</p>
    <p>Nur­flix’s launch was broad­cast live via its Face­book page Nur­flix.tv from a mosque in Shah Alam, Se­lan­gor, and the event was of­fi­ci­ated by pop­u­lar preacher Habib Ali Zainal Abidin Al Hamid, who is also its ad­viser.</p>
    <p>Is­lamic val­ues may not scream prime time en­ter­tain­ment, but Nur­flix be­lieves there is a mass au­di­ence which yearns for Is­lam­based, fam­ily-ori­ented dra­mas and movies in Malaysia, whose pop­u­la­tion is 60 per cent Mus­lim.</p>
    <p>“Me­dia con­tent is able to change the think­ing and cul­ture of this gen­er­a­tion. The ex­ist­ing fil­ter­ing sys­tem does not solve the real is­sue, that is the con­tent mould or guide­lines,” Nur­flix’s cor­po­rate com­mu­ni­ca­tions di­rec­tor Iza­iha Zainol told The Sun­day Times. “Yes, Nur­flix is a re­sponse to this sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Nur­flix’s launch adds to what is al­ready hap­pen­ing in the lo­cal en­ter­tain­ment scene, as the Mus­lim pop­u­lace turns more con­ser­va­tive.</p>
    <p>Ac­tresses with their heads covered of­ten hold lead roles in lo­cal TV se­ries. On YouTube, all the coun­try’s top fe­male singers – from Siti Nurhal­iza to Yuna – wear head­scarves.</p>
    <p>There is a sim­i­lar shift to­wards con­ser­vatism among Mus­lims in In­done­sia, Brunei and Sin­ga­pore who also share a com­mon Malay lan­guage.</p>
    <p>Not sur­pris­ingly, Nur­flix has its eye on th­ese mar­kets.</p>
    <p>“At least for the first year of op­er­a­tions, Nur­flix is avail­able in Malaysia, Brunei and Sin­ga­pore,” said Mr Iza­iha. “We will reach for the South-east Asia re­gion be­fore go­ing to the Mid­dle East and Europe in the fol­low­ing years.”</p>
    <p>In this In­ter­net age, there is a worry among some in Malaysia’s Mus­lim com­mu­nity that par­ents have lost the bat­tle to con­trol what their chil­dren watch.</p>
    <p>Mr Ah­mad Haz­eri Ibrahim, 47, a Nur­flix sub­scriber, feels that it is time Mus­lim par­ents find an al­ter­na­tive medium for en­ter­tain­ment.</p>
    <p>“We should give Nur­flix a go. It’s im­por­tant to fil­ter the con­tent be­cause, as a par­ent, I would like my chil­dren to be in­stilled with good val­ues even when they’re look­ing for en­ter­tain­ment,” said Mr Ah­mad, who has four chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“This re­al­i­sa­tion came af­ter I got the shock of my life when I saw mi­nors danc­ing sug­ges­tively in a French film. So I’m go­ing to see what Nur­flix has to of­fer and how it can help cul­ti­vate good morale,” the busi­ness­man added.</p>
    <p>As beta testers, sub­scribers will en­joy the 12 orig­i­nal ti­tles ex­clu­sively aired on its stream TV plat­form, Nur­flix.tv, be­fore its of­fi­cial launch in Jan­uary next year.</p>
    <p>Is­lamic val­ues may not scream prime time en­ter­tain­ment, but Nur­flix be­lieves there is a mass au­di­ence which yearns for Is­lam-based, fam­ily-ori­ented dra­mas and movies in Malaysia, whose pop­u­la­tion is 60 per cent Mus­lim.</p>
