    <p>The elite Genghis Se­cu­rity Academy trains China’s top body­guards. Stu­dents learn to pro­tect the na­tion’s grow­ing ranks of mil­lion­aires from threats such as rob­bery and kid­nap­ping and, in­creas­ingly, hack­ing. Dig­i­tal defences are given the same weight dur­ing train­ing as com­bat, weapons train­ing and high-speed driv­ing.</p>
    <p>TIAN­JIN • At the Genghis Se­cu­rity Academy, which bills it­self as China’s only ded­i­cated body­guard school, stu­dents l earn that the threats to the coun­try’s newly rich in the tech­no­log­i­cal age are more likely to emerge from a hacker than a gun­man.</p>
    <p>Each day, stu­dents in match­ing black busi­ness suits toil from dawn to mid­night at the school in the eastern city of Tian­jin, where dig­i­tal defences are given equal peg­ging to the tra­di­tional close-pro­tec­tion skill set of com­bat, weapons train­ing and high-speed driv­ing.</p>
    <p>Around a thou­sand grad­u­ate each year, hop­ing to land jobs as guards to China’s bur­geon­ing ranks of the rich and fa­mous, po­si­tions which can be worth up to US$70,000 (S$95,000) – sev­eral times more than an an­nual of­fice wage.</p>
    <p>But the school says it can­not meet de­mand as China’s rapid growth mints mil­lion­aires – 4.4 mil­lion ac­cord­ing to a Credit Suisse 2019 report, more than i n the United States.</p>
    <p>The course fees are up to US$3,000 a stu­dent, and while they had to can­cel train­ing be­tween Fe­bru­ary and June be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, de­mand has not damp­ened.</p>
    <p>Only the best make the cut, said founder Chen Yongqing, in­sist­ing that his dis­ci­plinary stan­dards are stricter than those in the army.</p>
    <p>“I’m quick-tem­pered and very de­mand­ing,” the army vet­eran from China’s north­ern In­ner Mon­go­lia re­gion told Agence France-Presse. “Only by be­ing strict can we cul­ti­vate ev­ery good sword. If you don’t forge it well, it will break it­self.”</p>
    <p>About half of the stu­dents are for­mer mil­i­tary men, Mr Chen said.</p>
    <p>They train in rows in a large, shabby sports hall, hold­ing blue plas­tic guns ahead of them with a steady stare – be­fore prac­tis­ing hus­tling their clients safely into a black Audi with smashed win­dows.</p>
    <p>Mo­bile phones are con­fis­cated through­out, while meals are taken in si­lence in a large din­ing hall presided over by pic­tures of ac­claimed grad­u­ates, who have pro­tected ev­ery­one from China’s sec­ond-rich­est man Jack Ma to vis­it­ing French pres­i­dents.</p>
    <p>In one class, stu­dents in pairs work through a sce­nario pro­tect­ing a “client” from an in­truder. “Dan­ger!” shouted in­struc­tor Ji Pengfei, prompt­ing one guard to quickly throw the “boss” be­hind them and</p>
    <p>pull out a gun in the same move.</p>
    <p>Those who fail to do it in two sec­onds are as­signed 50 push-ups.</p>
    <p>But in a highly surveilled coun­try with a low rate of street crime, the modern min­der needs an up-to­date skill set, against state mon­i­tor­ing or pro­fes­sional hackers.</p>
    <p>“Chi­nese bosses don’t need you to fight,” Mr Chen told his stu­dents, re­fer­ring to a client base which in­cludes the coun­try’s big­gest real es­tate and tech firms.</p>
    <p>Re­pelling hacks on cell­phones and net­work se­cu­rity, spot­ting eaves­drop­pers and wip­ing data are all re­quired tools in the body­guard’s ar­moury. “What would you do if the boss wants to de­stroy a</p>
    <p>video file im­me­di­ately?” Mr Chen asked a class.</p>
    <p>Even so, old-school threats still ex­ist in China. Ear­lier this year, bil­lion­aire He Xiangjian, founder of elec­tri­cal ap­pli­ance man­u­fac­turer Midea and one of the coun­try’s rich­est men, was kid­napped at home.</p>
    <p>He re­port­edly es­caped by jump­ing into a river and was able to call the po­lice, who said they ar­rested five sus­pects at the scene.</p>
    <p>Stu­dent Zhu Peipei, a 33-year-old army vet­eran from north­ern Shanxi prov­ince, hopes be­com­ing a body­guard could off­set his lack of pro­fes­sional skills or aca­demic qual­i­fi­ca­tions. “And of course, it’s cool,” he added.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents must also nav­i­gate the quirks of their wealthy clients, said Mr Ji. Some trust only body­guards whose Chi­nese zo­diac sign matches theirs, he ex­plained, while one, from a For­tune 500 com­pany, wanted to hire only from his home town.</p>
    <p>The best can­di­dates can com­mand as much as 500,000 yuan (S$101,500) a year in­side China, but some set their sights on a post­ing over­seas, po­ten­tially work­ing with for­eign clients.</p>
    <p>“I want to work in the Philip­pines or Myan­mar,” one stu­dent said, re­quest­ing anonymity. “Then I can carry a gun... it will be more chal­leng­ing and I can earn more.”</p>
    <p>I’m quick-tem­pered and very de­mand­ing. Only by be­ing strict can we cul­ti­vate ev­ery good sword. If you don’t forge it well, it will break it­self.</p>
