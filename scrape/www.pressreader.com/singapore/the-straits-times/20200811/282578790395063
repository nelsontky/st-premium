    <p>CANADA • A Cana­dian brew­ery has apol­o­gised for nam­ing one of its beers af­ter the Maori term for “pu­bic hair”, and not “feather” as it had in­tended, CBC re­ported.</p>
    <p>Hell’s Base­ment Brew­ery i n Al­berta prov­ince launched its Hu­ruhuru (The Feather) New Zealand pale ale two years ago, us­ing the Maori term it be­lieved meant “feather”, to re­flect its light cit­rus taste for a sum­mer brew.</p>
    <p>But ear­lier this week, former tele­vi­sion per­son­al­ity Te Ha­mua Nikora, who is Maori, posted a Face­book video to ex­plain “hu­ruhuru” was more com­monly used in Te Reo Maori to re­fer to pu­bic hair, and said it would have been pru­dent and re­spect­ful to have con­sulted an ex­pert on the lan­guage.</p>
    <p>Brew­ery founder Mike Pa­triquin said they did not in­tend to of­fend any­one.</p>
    <p>“We ac­knowl­edge that we did not con­sider the com­mon­place use of the term hu­ruhuru as a ref­er­ence to pu­bic hair, and that con­sul­ta­tion with a Maori rep­re­sen­ta­tive would have been a bet­ter ref­er­ence than on­line dic­tio­nar­ies,” he said in a state­ment to CBC.</p>
    <p>“We wish to make es­pe­cially clear that it was not our in­tent to in­fringe upon, ap­pro­pri­ate or of­fend the Maori cul­ture or peo­ple in any way; to those who feel dis­re­spected, we apol­o­gise.”</p>
    <p>Mr Pa­triquin said the brew­ery in­tends to re­name the of­fend­ing brew.</p>
    <p>Nikora has also called out a leather shop in the New Zealand cap­i­tal Welling­ton named Hu­ruhuru.</p>
