    <p>Com­pa­nies in Sin­ga­pore suf­fered a sig­nif­i­cant fall in earn­ings due to the Covid-19 pan­demic and sank deeper into debt, although most should still be able to with­stand short-term fi­nan­cial pres­sures for now, the Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) said.</p>
    <p>In its an­nual Fi­nan­cial Sta­bil­ity Re­view re­leased yes­ter­day, MAS also said firms and banks have so far re­mained gen­er­ally re­silient, de­spite the shock of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It added that swift gov­ern­ment sup­port for the cor­po­rate sec­tor has fur­ther helped, with ef­forts fo­cused on ex­tend­ing credit to small and medium-sized en­ter­prises.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, cor­po­rates with highly lever­aged po­si­tions and smaller firms with weaker cash buf­fers re­main vul­ner­a­ble and could come un­der more se­vere strain,” MAS cau­tioned.</p>
    <p>Firms such as those in con­struc­tion, travel-re­lated ser­vices and property were also hit harder by a drop in do­mes­tic de­mand and safe man­age­ment mea­sures, it said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, cor­po­rate debt as a per­cent­age of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) has been ris­ing be­cause of low in­ter­est rates.</p>
    <p>The debt ra­tio hit 163 per cent in the se­cond quar­ter of this year, re­flect­ing both a pickup in cor­po­rate debt and a fall in GDP.</p>
    <p>At the same time, banks saw a rise in cor­po­rate non-per­form­ing loans ra­tios, which rose to 3.4 per cent in the third quar­ter of this year, com­pared with 2.5 per cent in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>“The higher ra­tios re­flect the preva­lence of firms in sec­tors ad­versely af­fected by the Covid-19 pan­demic – whole­sale trade, re­tail, food and bev­er­age, tourism-re­lated in­dus­tries – and oil-re­lated in­dus­tries im­pacted by the col­lapse of oil prices ear­lier in the year,” MAS said.</p>
    <p>Over­all, Sin­ga­pore firms “have weath­ered the ini­tial earn­ings shock from Covid-19 rel­a­tively well” as they took steps to re­tain liq­uid­ity, sup­ported by the Gov­ern­ment and as­sis­tance mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Listed firms have bol­stered cash buf­fers, MAS noted. But it warned that ef­forts to ease short-term cash flow con­cerns have also in­creased other risks, such as re­pay­ment dif­fi­cul­ties, if the eco­nomic re­cov­ery is bumpy.</p>
    <p>Smaller firms would also have weaker cash buf­fers and be more severely im­pacted by the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>That said, fi­nanc­ing con­di­tions re­main sup­port­ive against an un­even eco­nomic re­cov­ery, and “strong cap­i­tal and liq­uid­ity po­si­tions pro­vide a ro­bust base for banks to con­tinue supporting the econ­omy’s de­mand for credit”.</p>
    <p>MAS said in­sur­ers have also re­mained strong amid the un­cer­tain eco­nomic out­look, bol­stered by the en­hanced cap­i­tal frame­work that came into ef­fect in March.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy is ex­pected to pick up next year, but its un­even tra­jec­tory will im­pinge on cor­po­rate prof­its. The fi­nan­cial sec­tor and firms have to re­main vig­i­lant, MAS added.</p>
    <p>“The pro­longed low in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment and as­set qual­ity de­te­ri­o­ra­tion amid con­tin­ued un­cer­tainty in the global out­look will ex­ert pres­sure on banks’ prof­itabil­ity, even as they con­tinue to main­tain strong un­der­writ­ing stan­dards and healthy cap­i­tal buf­fers,” it said.</p>
    <p>“Banks should also con­tinue to ac­tively mon­i­tor and man­age their for­eign cur­rency risks pru­dently to guard against a re­newed tight­en­ing of global fund­ing con­di­tions.”</p>
    <p>In­sur­ers are also ex­pected to be im­pacted by a pro­longed low in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment and “should closely mon­i­tor their sol­vency po­si­tions”, MAS said.</p>
    <p>The pro­longed low in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment and as­set qual­ity de­te­ri­o­ra­tion amid con­tin­ued un­cer­tainty in the global out­look will ex­ert pres­sure on banks’ prof­itabil­ity, even as they con­tinue to main­tain strong un­der­writ­ing stan­dards and healthy cap­i­tal buf­fers.</p>
