    <p>Of­fi­cials who had im­posed Hong Kong’s harsh­est mea­sures four months ago to gain con­trol of the pan­demic are re­in­stat­ing some of the tough rules, after a re­lax­ation saw a new wave of the Covid-19 out­break move to­wards its peak.</p>
    <p>To curb the flow of peo­ple, from to­mor­row till Dec 23, dine-in ser­vices will be stopped be­tween 6pm and 4.59am the fol­low­ing day, with the cap on pa­trons per ta­ble dur­ing dine-in hours to re­main at two.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses such as gyms, sports cen­tres as well as beauty and mas­sage par­lours will also be closed dur­ing those hours.</p>
    <p>Ban­quets will have to cut ca­pac­ity from a max­i­mum of 40 pa­trons to 20, while more civil ser­vants are to work from home.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong recorded 100 new in­fec­tions yes­ter­day, bring­ing its to­tal to more than 7,000 with 112 deaths. Of the new cases, 95 are lo­cal and 27 have un­known sources.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials noted that just in the past two weeks alone, there were 1,074 new cases, and over 90 per cent are lo­cal.</p>
    <p>They said there are now at least seven clus­ters with more than 10 cases, in­clud­ing the dance club clus­ter – which started three weeks ago – that now has about 650 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Sec­re­tary for Food and Health Sophia Chan said at a brief­ing that the gov­ern­ment now has the power to seal off ar­eas hit by Covid-19 for up to seven days so that tests can be car­ried out on those af­fected. Health of­fi­cials will de­cide which ar­eas are to be cor­doned off and for how long. Food and ba­sic ne­ces­si­ties will be given to those af­fected.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials have re­peat­edly warned that there is a greater num­ber of younger pa­tients in crit­i­cal con­di­tions this time round.</p>
    <p>At the brief­ing, they said 38 pa­tients are in crit­i­cal con­di­tion while 46 are in se­ri­ous con­di­tion as at yes­ter­day, while 78 per cent of in­ten­sive care unit (ICU) beds were filled.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the day, Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam noted that be­fore the lat­est wave hit, crit­i­cal cases had fallen to a sin­gle digit and most of them were el­derly.</p>
    <p>“More ICUs have to be mo­bilised. Of the crit­i­cal cases, six are un­der the age of 60 and two are un­der the age of 50. For se­ri­ous cases, nine of them are un­der 60 and two of them are un­der 50.</p>
    <p>“From the ob­ser­va­tion of ex­perts and our ob­ser­va­tion, it seems that the sit­u­a­tion is more com­pli­cated, much, much more than the last one, be­cause we’re talk­ing about dif­fer­ent peo­ple of dif­fer­ent jobs liv­ing in dif­fer­ent dis­tricts all over the ter­ri­tory,” she said.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to reim­pose tough rules came as the city’s streets re­mained mostly busy, with peo­ple go­ing about their daily rou­tine.</p>
    <p>The clo­sure of leisure spots, such as cin­e­mas, karaoke lounges, bars and pubs is among the few hints of the pan­demic’s im­pact, as is the shut­ter­ing of eater­ies by 10pm.</p>
    <p>Over the week­end, checks by The Straits Times showed many peo­ple do­ing a spot of Christ­mas shop­ping. Some were try­ing to snag Christ­mas trees, whose prices have gone up as cel­e­bra­tions are des­tined to be at home with party rooms’ forced clo­sures. Many fam­i­lies were out en­joy­ing the good weather with pic­nics in parks.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ben Cowl­ing, an in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert from the Univer­sity of Hong Kong, said he is more con­cerned about in­door crowds than out­door gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>“It will be im­por­tant for peo­ple to mod­ify their be­hav­iours again if we are to get over this fourth wave soon. So­cial dis­tanc­ing has been vi­tal in bring­ing our pre­vi­ous waves to an end,” he noted.</p>
    <p>From Fri­day, fines for breach­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules will be raised to HK$5,000 (S$862) from HK$2,000, among other pre­vi­ously man­dated mea­sures such as a pub­lic gath­er­ing cap of two.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials are also man­dat­ing that spe­cific groups un­dergo free tests, such as those in the dance club clus­ter and, most re­cently, taxi driv­ers who plan to work from Christ­mas through to late next month.</p>
    <p>Dr Le­ung Chi Chiu of the Hong Kong Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion noted that be­sides weak en­force­ment on the part of the gov­ern­ment, pri­vate busi­nesses and the pub­lic have not ad­hered to calls to stay home. “The high de­gree of so­cial mix­ing nul­li­fies much of the ef­forts in test­ing and con­tact trac­ing in cut­ting the trans­mis­sion links,” he added.</p>
