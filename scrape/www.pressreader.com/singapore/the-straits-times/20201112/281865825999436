    <p>•</p>
    <p>TOKYO A hum­ble i nk stamp known as hanko is Ja­pan’s new prime min­is­ter’s tar­get of ire.</p>
    <p>It might seem para­dox­i­cal in a coun­try of­ten as­sumed to be a fu­tur­is­tic tech-savvy paradise, but Ja­pan’s busi­ness world and bu­reau­cracy re­main heav­ily de­pen­dent on pa­per doc­u­ments, hand­stamped with ap­proval.</p>
    <p>The draw­backs of the hanko – which is used for ev­ery­thing from de­liv­ery re­ceipts to mar­riage cer­tifi­cates – have be­come in­creas­ingly clear dur­ing the Covid-19 out­break, when many Ja­panese were un­able to work from home be­cause they had to phys­i­cally stamp doc­u­ments in the of­fice.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga is on a push to dig­i­talise the na­tion, but he faces an up­hill strug­gle when it comes to the stamps, which range from mass-pro­duced plas­tic ones to hand-carved wooden ver­sions used on spe­cial oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>In­deed, ar­ti­san stamp-maker Takahiro Makino, who painstak­ingly carves minia­ture char­ac­ters into each unique piece he makes, is not too wor­ried about the drive.</p>
    <p>“We shouldn’t keep us­ing things that aren’t nec­es­sary. How­ever, an ob­ject of value will sur­vive, no mat­ter what,” he told Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency at his work­shop in down­town Tokyo.</p>
    <p>For each stamp, he care­fully paints the name of the per­son or com­pany that will adorn it, be­fore be­gin­ning the del­i­cate work of chis­elling.</p>
    <p>Each stamp will “carry the per­son­al­ity of each crafts­man”, the 44-year-old said.</p>
    <p>Sturdy hand­made stamps like Mr Makino’s cost sev­eral hun­dred dol­lars and are also given by par­ents to chil­dren as a com­ing-of-age gift – an es­sen­tial tool for a re­spon­si­ble adult.</p>
    <p>Each stamp’s unique de­sign is reg­is­tered at city hall so that it can be ver­i­fied when used to val­i­date prop­erty deeds and other im­por­tant doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>For ev­ery­day sig­na­tures, peo­ple use smaller, cheaper mass-pro­duced seals, and th­ese stamps are of­ten a key part of an of­fice worker’s daily grind.</p>
    <p>That is pre­cisely what Mr Suga and his ad­min­is­tra­tive re­form min­is­ter Taro Kono are keen to stamp out.</p>
    <p>“I will in­sist no seals be re­quired for ad­min­is­tra­tive pro­ce­dures un­less they are jus­ti­fied,” Mr Kono said at a press con­fer­ence soon af­ter his ap­point­ment.</p>
    <p>Ex­am­ples of hanko ex­cess are not hard to come by, with Mr Kono him­self cit­ing doc­u­ments re­port­edly stamped more than 40 times by dif­fer­ent of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment’s push has al­ready borne some fruit, with Ja­pan’s na­tional po­lice agency say­ing it will stop the manda­tory use of the seals for ca­sual doc­u­ment ap­provals from next year.</p>
    <p>Big Ja­panese com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing Hi­tachi, have also vowed to abol­ish hanko use in in­ter­nal pa­per­work.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers warn, how­ever, that stream­lin­ing the reams of pa­per­work that swamp Ja­panese com­pa­nies and gov­ern­ment of­fices in­volves deeper-rooted is­sues.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan Re­search In­sti­tute man­ager Takayuki Watan­abe sees the stamps as part of Ja­pan’s hi­er­ar­chi­cal busi­ness cul­ture.</p>
    <p>To get a de­ci­sion ap­proved, an em­ployee of­ten needs stamped ap­proval from col­leagues above them in rank, one by one, he told AFP.</p>
    <p>“First, you need a seal from your su­pe­rior, then the team leader, the sec­tion chief and the depart­ment di­rec­tor,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It’s a no-no to skip those in the mid­dle.”</p>
    <p>The top boss usu­ally stamps his seal up­right on the left of a doc­u­ment, with lower-rank­ing em­ploy­ees all tilt­ing their stamps to­wards it as if “bow­ing”.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing the whole team’s stamps shows a col­lec­tive de­ci­sion has been made, Mr Watan­abe said.</p>
    <p>“It’s like, ‘I stamped my seal to ap­prove it but you did it be­fore me, so you should be held li­able’,” ac­coun­tant Tet­suya Katayama ex­plained.</p>
    <p>“No one wants to take re­spon­si­bil­ity in Ja­pan,” he said.</p>
    <p>At the All Ja­pan Hanko In­dus­try As­so­ci­a­tion, se­nior of­fi­cial Kei­ichi</p>
    <p>Fukushima is a per­haps un­likely ad­vo­cate for scal­ing back stamp­ing.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple have used hanko stamps just for the sake of stamp­ing,” he con­ceded, but added that in­sist­ing they are used only when nec­es­sary will clar­ify when they are ac­tu­ally needed and “may be a good chance to prove how im­por­tant the cus­tom of hanko is”.</p>
