Pandan-smelling tap water linked to presence of organic compound but water supply remains safe: PUB OnFacebook would view his commitment as supplement­ary to his full-time job. It’s always nice to want someone to serve as a full-time MP. We could try to make it compulsory to go full time if elected as an MP, and see what calibre of candidates comes forward to contest the election. Should Members of Parliament go full time?
