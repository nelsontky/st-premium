    <p>Ru­in­ing a per­son’s life for mak­ing a mis­take, even if it was made years ago and the per­son has changed for the bet­ter, has be­come a trend on the In­ter­net also known as “can­cel cul­ture”.</p>
    <p>“Can­cel cul­ture” does more harm than good. There is ab­so­lutely no jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for wrong­do­ing, but we need to re­mem­ber that no­body is im­mune from mak­ing mis­takes and no­body is per­fect.</p>
    <p>In­stead of ru­in­ing other peo­ple’s lives or caus­ing them to lose their jobs over a mis­take they made in the past, we should ed­u­cate them and give them a chance to change for the bet­ter.</p>
    <p>Some peo­ple may not have known that what they did or said was wrong, es­pe­cially if the mis­take was made when they were much younger.</p>
    <p>There have been cases of peo­ple be­ing “can­celled” over past mis­takes, even if they have changed for the bet­ter, which tells me that “can­cel cul­ture” en­cour­ages a re­fusal to for­give and ac­cept that peo­ple can change for the bet­ter.</p>
    <p>We have the Yel­low Rib­bon move­ment to give for­mer con­victs a se­cond chance and rein­te­grate them into so­ci­ety, so why can’t we for­give oth­ers for less se­ri­ous mis­takes or of­fences?</p>
    <p>So­ci­ety will never progress if we don’t learn to for­give, give oth­ers a se­cond chance and ac­cept that peo­ple can change for the bet­ter. A per­son’s past should not mat­ter if he has changed for the bet­ter.</p>
    <p>We should cre­ate an en­vi­ron­ment that en­cour­ages ed­u­ca­tion and for­give­ness to truly progress. It’s time to end “can­cel cul­ture” once and for all.</p>
